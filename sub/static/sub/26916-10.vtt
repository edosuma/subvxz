WEBVTT

00:11.360 --> 00:13.680
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:14.560 --> 00:20.400
On the eve of his death, I finally
made peace with the great King Alfred.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.600
[Alfred] You are hereby pardoned.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.120
[Uhtred] He is gone.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.680
Wessex is in chaos.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.240
Have a messenger return to Mercia.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.600
I'd like the comfort
of further hearth-guards.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.360
[Uhtred] And his vision of one England
is incomplete.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.600
It is the purpose of the witan
to choose a king.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.200
Uhtred cannot be allowed
to ally himself to Edward.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.360
[Uhtred] This is the moment the Danes
have long waited for.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.480
But Brida seeks the truth.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.640
[Brida] Men are saying he killed Ragnar.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.760
-Aethelwold?
-Was it him?

00:54.840 --> 00:57.240
[Cnut] He was in fear of Ragnar.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.680
Then he's mine to kill.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.360
[Uhtred] Only with Thyra's blood
can we send my brother Ragnar to Valhalla.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.720
You will tell your friend Uhtred
his pardon is to be rescinded.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.880
He must leave Winchester
or I shall have him taken.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.120
[Uhtred] The lady Aelswith has dishonored
her husband's wishes

01:13.200 --> 01:14.360
and I am imprisoned,

01:15.200 --> 01:19.200
at a time when my sister
is seen only as a Dane.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.360
Is that not what she is?

01:21.840 --> 01:22.880
[Uhtred] An enemy.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.160
In a hole is where you belong.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.040
[choking]

01:30.400 --> 01:31.760
[Uhtred] Destiny is all.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.720
[theme music playing]

02:16.440 --> 02:18.480
[Thyra] Beocca!

02:18.560 --> 02:21.280
-[thudding]
-Beocca!

02:22.840 --> 02:25.120
[sobs] Beocca!

02:25.760 --> 02:27.200
Beocca, my love!

02:29.320 --> 02:30.600
[choir singing]

02:33.200 --> 02:35.160
[Erkenwald reciting prayer]

02:35.240 --> 02:36.560
[singing continues]

02:48.520 --> 02:49.840
[Thyra] Beocca!

02:53.000 --> 02:54.280
[grunting]

02:54.360 --> 02:56.520
[Erkenwald] He is with God.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.920
May his soul rest in peace
for all eternity. Amen.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.080
[woman] Fire! Sound the bell. Fire!

03:09.640 --> 03:10.760
Fetch the water!

03:13.440 --> 03:16.880
[Aethelwold] We should meet, Lord.
Continue our previous discussion.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.080
For what purpose?

03:18.160 --> 03:22.280
The Danes will hear of Alfred's death
and they will attack Mercia.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.440
Mercia will be ready.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.440
To die? Or to thrive?

03:26.080 --> 03:26.960
Find me.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.640
I find him to be lower
than a snake's belly.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.400
That does not mean that he is wrong.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.720
-[indistinct yelling]
-[bell ringing]

03:41.360 --> 03:44.280
We need to stop the fire spreading!
Get more water!

03:44.880 --> 03:46.960
For Christ's sake, get more water!

03:47.520 --> 03:48.600
[Finan] Oh, be-Jesus!

03:50.480 --> 03:51.720
[Osferth] Oh, dear Lord!

03:51.800 --> 03:53.800
Fetch Father Beocca! Fetch him now! Go!

03:53.880 --> 03:54.960
[Sihtric] More water!

03:55.800 --> 03:57.080
Thyra? Is she inside?

03:57.160 --> 04:00.560
-I thought she was at the palace.
-No, no, she left. She walked out!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.080
[man] More water!

04:06.600 --> 04:08.800
[gasping]

04:08.880 --> 04:10.360
[Aelswith] Father Beocca?

04:11.080 --> 04:14.400
We would like a last moment with the king.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.360
Alone.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.560
Yes, of course.

04:21.279 --> 04:24.400
-Lady Aelswith, forgive me.
-[Osferth whispers indistinctly]

04:24.480 --> 04:26.480
You're going against the king's wishes.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.120
Father Beocca? You may be needed.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.480
[Sihtric] Get the door! Get the door!

04:36.560 --> 04:39.120
Get back! Get back!

04:39.200 --> 04:40.880
[people screaming]

04:49.240 --> 04:52.000
No! No, this is not happening!

04:52.080 --> 04:53.160
Thyra!

04:54.840 --> 04:57.000
I'm here! I am here!

04:58.480 --> 05:00.280
Thyra!

05:01.440 --> 05:02.760
[sobbing]

05:10.720 --> 05:11.920
Thyra!

05:19.000 --> 05:21.120
[inaudible]

05:24.240 --> 05:25.360
Beocca.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.640
[inaudible]

06:15.600 --> 06:18.920
Father, she is with God now.
You know that.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.720
And he will welcome her, I'm sure.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.040
[sniffles] It's how her family died,
in a fire.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.720
You think that would be a comfort?
Or would it terrify her further?

06:31.800 --> 06:34.360
Father, all we know
is that she's at peace now.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.960
She's at peace.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.160
You need to walk away now, Father.
A drink of ale, maybe?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.840
Once the heat has gone,

06:49.920 --> 06:52.960
I shall recover her
and wrap her for you to bury.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.360
I... No... I will find her.
She is my wife.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.760
She is. We'll help you then.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.120
This fire did not just happen. It did not.

07:08.960 --> 07:13.200
These are dark and important days
for both Wessex and Mercia.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.760
Just as soon as the Danes hear
of Alfred's death--

07:15.840 --> 07:18.440
They will attack, you have said,
and we agree.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.240
-We will fight.
-Why? Why fight only to lose?

07:22.320 --> 07:23.440
Who says we must lose?

07:23.520 --> 07:25.880
To have even a chance,
Mercia would need Wessex,

07:25.960 --> 07:29.080
and Wessex has been left
with a pup as its master. You'll lose.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.480
The Danes will march
and we will have to fight.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.480
[Aethelwold] We negotiate.
Then let them slaughter Edward

07:34.560 --> 07:37.400
and the small number of idiots
who choose to follow him.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.320
Small number?

07:38.400 --> 07:42.160
He does not have all of Wessex behind him.
Some will follow, but not all.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.360
Wessex will not have great numbers of men.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.520
Lord Sigebriht is about to return to Cent

07:46.600 --> 07:48.880
and ready his own
considerable guard and fyrd.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.000
To do what? To join the Danes?

07:51.080 --> 07:53.400
Edward is not Alfred
and never can be, but--

07:54.680 --> 07:58.120
-There'll be no need for swords!
-I am merely introducing myself.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.560
-You will let me go!
-Not until there is calm.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.480
There is madness.
Father Beocca, you are suffering.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.720
I do not wish to hear your voice.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.960
It was you who killed her,
not some stray ember on a bed of straw.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.360
-[Aethelwold] I am not to blame for your--
-[Beocca] It was you.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.760
If not directly,
then by the words you whisper,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.800
by the lies you tell, the bile you spew!

08:20.880 --> 08:22.760
I think we should find another table.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.840
In the eyes of some, a gentle woman
became an enemy and nothing more.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.560
You should turn a deaf ear to this man.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.640
Father Beocca,
I will forgive this display, just once.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.400
Another word and you will pay.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.480
What have I said? Wessex is splintered.
I will have no more of it.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.160
[men yelling indistinctly]

09:13.960 --> 09:17.000
[men grunting]

09:17.080 --> 09:18.680
[Cnut] Haesten? What is this?

09:18.760 --> 09:22.160
It is the beginning, my friend. [laughs]

09:22.240 --> 09:25.680
Alfred, king of the shit-eating Saxons...

09:26.600 --> 09:29.720
has breathed his last! The king is dead!

09:29.800 --> 09:30.920
[men cheering]

09:32.320 --> 09:34.680
Haesten, and you are certain this time?

09:35.280 --> 09:38.080
-Dagfinn?
-[Dagfinn] It is true, Lord.

09:38.640 --> 09:44.040
We have heard it many times, from priests
and warriors and peasants alike.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.720
They cry in the streets of Winchester.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.440
-Then it begins.
-[Haesten] Hmm.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.040
It begins.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.120
Sharpen your blades! It begins!

09:59.040 --> 10:00.680
[men grunting]

10:17.920 --> 10:20.680
[Uhtred] Is there to be a trial,
or a simple execution?

10:20.760 --> 10:24.040
[Aethelflaed] It was my mother's intention
to cut your throat,

10:24.120 --> 10:26.640
but she has been persuaded
to revert to banishment.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.840
You are to leave Winchester and Wessex
and never return.

10:30.920 --> 10:31.880
And what of Edward?

10:31.960 --> 10:35.280
What of the king's letter, his pardon?
Does that count for nothing?

10:35.360 --> 10:39.360
Uhtred, you must leave
or she will have you killed.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.640
Find Beocca.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.760
I must speak to Beocca. Fetch him, please.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.560
I cannot fetch him.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.240
He has trials enough.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.600
What trials?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.200
[Beocca] I am here.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.800
I have heard what the lady has said,

11:01.880 --> 11:04.560
and I am here to beg you, Uhtred,
to beg you to stay.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.160
[Aethelflaed] He cannot stay.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.000
-There will be a hearing.
-Perhaps.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.280
-And we shall be heard. We must.
-[Uhtred] What has happened?

11:11.360 --> 11:14.800
Accept a trial and speak out.
If you do not, the devil will have won!

11:14.880 --> 11:17.800
-Beocca?
-Do not abandon what you helped to build.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.600
[Uhtred] There is a change in you.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.480
Thyra is with God... the gods, even.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.720
-How?
-[Beocca] Fire.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.080
Set by good Christian men, no doubt.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.160
Which men?

11:53.880 --> 11:57.360
[Beocca] She is with Gisela now.
She is with her mother.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.880
We cannot allow ourselves
to be consumed by her death.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.880
All that Alfred stood for is crumbling.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.480
You, Uhtred, cannot be dragged
into the shadows.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.120
You must become the light.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.160
[Aethelred] My Lady Aethelflaed.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.400
You will inform your brother
and your mother

12:35.480 --> 12:38.280
that Mercia has a king with his own mind.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.440
I will do nothing of the sort.

12:40.520 --> 12:45.400
Alfred is gone. Therefore, all agreements
made with Alfred no longer stand.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.400
Mercia will remain allied with Wessex.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.240
The two countries will stand together
or they will fail.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.800
The two countries are equals.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.960
Each free to choose
who to befriend and who to fight.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.000
Who to fight?

13:01.120 --> 13:05.960
Lord Aldhelm, you must remind my husband
what it means to be a Mercian.

13:10.040 --> 13:15.200
Lord King, I must say
I do not disagree with her.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.760
I need assuring, Lord,

13:18.840 --> 13:21.920
that you will not align Mercia
with Aethelwold, nor the Danes.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.240
It would be a betrayal.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.840
[Aethelred] You need assuring?

13:24.920 --> 13:27.840
-We are proud Mercians, Lord.
-Do you question me?

13:29.760 --> 13:31.120
I am concerned.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.240
Do you doubt me?

13:34.520 --> 13:36.880
I simply wish to understand your thinking.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.400
My guard of 50 men.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.280
Did you send for them?

13:41.360 --> 13:43.320
You will agree they are needed at home.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.200
Did you send for my guard of 50 men?

13:49.680 --> 13:50.680
I did not.

13:57.520 --> 14:03.200
Should you live, Aldhelm,
never disobey me again. Never.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.240
[Aldhelm grunting]

14:07.880 --> 14:10.120
Your wound is from an alehouse brawl.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.320
I have been considering
my defection to the Danes.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.040
-I will hold until the very last moment.
-[Aethelwold] Meaning what?

14:23.640 --> 14:27.440
Edward will march and I will promise
to join him, but I will arrive late.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.000
As the Danes attack from the front,
I will attack from the rear.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.320
My army against a fyrd of peasants.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.600
It'll be a slaughter
and my men will survive.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.280
I can almost hear the screams of panic.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.760
[panting] Lady, forgive me.
I did not know where else to go.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.160
He believes he can negotiate...

15:31.120 --> 15:34.040
[grunting] or is at least
considering the possibility.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.360
The bleeding has stemmed. I hope.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.560
A gut wound is a slow death.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.480
A gut wound can heal. It will heal.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.520
[breathing heavily]

15:55.440 --> 15:56.520
Lady...

16:00.840 --> 16:02.040
you have my heart.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.720
I fear that I love you.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.440
If I can't say it while dying,
when will I?

16:12.520 --> 16:13.600
You are not dying.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.600
Lady, you must act, for Mercia. You must.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.880
Call the men to arms and save us.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.360
[door opens]

16:41.320 --> 16:42.360
It's time.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.600
I am to take you
to the frontier of Mercia,

16:47.280 --> 16:49.080
to witness you leaving Wessex.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.920
Lord? What is this, a hunting party?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.680
[Uhtred] I am an outlaw once again.
To be banished or executed.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.680
Shall we follow you, Lord?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.640
Leave Winchester for the Danes?

17:15.359 --> 17:16.200
[Steapa] Lord?

17:17.640 --> 17:18.880
Walk.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.400
[Aelswith] What is he doing?

17:23.359 --> 17:24.880
He's standing still, Lady.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.240
Uhtred, you will walk
and you will get up onto your horse!

17:49.960 --> 17:54.760
I am a free man.
I have a letter of pardon.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.600
It bears the king's seal.
It is written in the king's hand--

17:59.680 --> 18:00.880
Someone take his tongue.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.880
Does Alfred's word count for nothing,
now that he is gone?

18:03.960 --> 18:07.440
And you are a man who once held a knife
to the king's throat.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.520
Show us one witness who can say
this letter was written willingly.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.040
-One witness.
-[Uhtred] There was no witness.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.760
We are gifting you your life!
You shall be grateful

18:16.840 --> 18:18.800
and you shall leave this land in peace!

18:18.880 --> 18:22.560
There will be no peace, Lady.
War is coming.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.640
[crowd murmuring]

18:23.720 --> 18:26.920
[Uhtred] There is a Dane army
marching this very moment.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.200
And I will not abandon
the people of Wessex--

18:30.280 --> 18:32.600
[Aelswith] Who do you think you are?
Steapa!

18:32.680 --> 18:35.600
-The entire city is watching.
-Uhtred speaks the truth.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.560
-And you are nothing but smitten.
-[Beocca] Lady Aelswith!

18:38.640 --> 18:41.160
I cannot let this injustice
go unchallenged.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.200
If Uhtred of Bebbanburg claims
to have been made a free man

18:44.280 --> 18:45.840
by King Alfred himself...

18:47.360 --> 18:51.600
we cannot dismiss it so lightly.
Only a king can deny a king.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.040
Wessex has no king. Wessex has no king!

18:54.120 --> 18:55.400
We have Edward Rex.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.680
The witan decides who is king.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.440
[Uhtred] Edward is the aetheling.

18:59.520 --> 19:03.120
He has no authority.
He is Alfred's son and nothing more!

19:03.200 --> 19:05.760
I'm sure the monasteries
are full of Alfred's sons.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.280
Do all bastards have a claim to the crown?

19:08.360 --> 19:10.600
Bishop Erkenwald,
you will end this display.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.000
King or not, if Edward believes
the letter of pardon to be untrue,

19:14.600 --> 19:15.880
then I will leave Wessex.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.080
[Erkenwald] Steapa, you will return
the prisoner to the palace.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.160
This is no place for such decisions.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.840
This is precisely the place!
Justice must be seen to be done!

19:24.920 --> 19:28.200
Steapa! Unhand the prisoner.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.040
Though he remains a prisoner,

19:32.520 --> 19:36.560
I will allow Lord Uhtred to speak.
He has earned that right.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.520
Though you have not, Lord, not yet.
You have no authority.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.200
Do you object to the people bearing
witness to justice, Lord Aethelwold?

19:45.240 --> 19:46.440
I do not.

19:48.200 --> 19:53.240
[Edward] Uhtred, the king swore that you
were to die. Why the change in his heart?

19:53.320 --> 19:55.880
Because he believed
that I deserved his forgiveness.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.080
Is that a boast?

19:57.160 --> 19:59.400
Look to his chronicle. I am on every page.

19:59.480 --> 20:03.160
That is a lie.
You are not named, even once!

20:03.240 --> 20:07.360
But I am there.
Unwritten, Lady, but I am there!

20:07.440 --> 20:09.800
The warriors of Wessex know it.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.000
The Danes know it.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.120
And it is what the king
has told me himself.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.600
I have heard enough.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.640
[Uhtred] I am with him
from the Somerset Marshes to Ethandun

20:20.720 --> 20:22.840
and all of the battles that have followed.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.920
We were bonded, him and I.

20:28.680 --> 20:33.080
He was the man that I could never be,
nor did I wish to be.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.440
He was a man that I loved and despised...

20:40.880 --> 20:44.160
but it was never less than an honor
to serve him.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.960
He was my king.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.000
And he did not wish to go to his God

20:52.080 --> 20:56.200
without granting me what I have earned
many times over!

20:56.880 --> 20:58.120
My freedom.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.560
-[crowd murmuring]
-But the question remains:

21:01.640 --> 21:03.720
Why did he choose not to announce it?

21:27.600 --> 21:34.120
You will remember my great friend Leofric,
a warrior and a Saxon to the bone!

21:36.000 --> 21:40.160
He told me once
that I could never better Alfred.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.600
"Because the bastard thinks," he said.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.600
[crowd chuckles]

21:48.360 --> 21:52.560
Perhaps your father chose not to announce
my freedom for this very reason...

21:54.120 --> 22:00.080
so that the people could witness their
new king, Edward, dispensing justice.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.200
Fairly, I hope.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.640
Will you accept the decision
of Edward Rex?

22:06.720 --> 22:08.280
I will. I give you my word.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.760
-Lord--
-Again, I say, and with respect,

22:12.840 --> 22:15.680
the boy does not have the power
to make such a statement.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.000
He is an aetheling and nothing more.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.920
He is no more an heir to the crown
than myself.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.400
Lord, the decision is yours to make.

22:34.760 --> 22:39.760
My father, King Alfred,
demanded loyalty, unity.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.080
He believed in his god
and doubted those who did not.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.160
A heathen would not be trusted completely

22:47.240 --> 22:51.760
until he had embraced
Alfred's god as his own.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.040
And yet...

23:02.520 --> 23:06.480
it was a heathen he did trust most.

23:07.400 --> 23:11.720
It was the word of Uhtred
that he respected most.

23:15.720 --> 23:21.040
Uhtred of Bebbanburg, I find the letter
written by my father to be true.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.560
Alfred's pardon does stand.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.760
You are a free man,
able to choose your own path.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.920
[crowd cheering]

23:30.000 --> 23:32.960
May I ask, Lord Uhtred, may I ask?

23:33.840 --> 23:37.680
Now that you are a free man once more,
where will your path lead?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.560
I would like to know.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.840
Steapa, my sword.

23:48.560 --> 23:54.560
One day, Father, I hope that my path
will eventually lead north to Bebbanburg,

23:55.880 --> 23:57.720
but now, I believe I am needed here.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.680
-I will follow Edward Rex!
-[crowd cheering]

24:22.360 --> 24:26.040
Cnut, swear to the gods that it was
Aethelwold who killed Ragnar.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.720
It was. I swear.

24:29.800 --> 24:34.000
He must not fall in battle. If you wish
to see Ragnar in the hall of the slain,

24:34.080 --> 24:36.480
then Aethelwold must not just fall
to any sword.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.520
-[Cnut] I do not understand.
-Keep him safe until I'm ready.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.320
Do it for me and for Ragnar.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.880
I will. I will keep him safe.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.080
[Brida] We fight for Ragnar!

24:48.160 --> 24:51.120
And for every Dane that has ever fallen
to a Saxon sword!

24:51.200 --> 24:53.800
[men shouting]

24:55.880 --> 24:59.400
If the Danes are moving through
East Anglia and towards eastern Mercia,

24:59.480 --> 25:01.320
then that land is Danelaw.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.080
Their army can only grow.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.520
As before, we must march out to meet them.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.760
[Aethelred] I've spies inside Danelaw.
They confirmed they are moving closer.

25:12.360 --> 25:15.360
I have issued an order for my men
at the frontier to retreat.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.280
Retreat?

25:16.360 --> 25:19.400
It is good sense, Lord.
Every warrior must be made to count.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.640
[Aethelred] But how far do I retreat?

25:22.240 --> 25:24.760
Where and when does Mercia make a stand?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.960
Where and when will we be joined
by Wessex?

25:27.040 --> 25:28.400
That is to be decided.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.760
I would like to know.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.360
Because Wessex appears to be
in a land of chaos and doubt.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.120
Does each of the handful of ealdormen here
stand with Edward?

25:37.200 --> 25:40.520
We do. Of course we do.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.080
He is to be king.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.000
Lord Sigebriht?

25:49.280 --> 25:50.360
We do.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.760
[Aethelred] And what of those
who are not here?

25:53.440 --> 25:57.280
Those who hurried back to their halls,
despite knowing there is talk of war?

25:57.360 --> 25:58.920
They are with us!

25:59.000 --> 26:01.600
Wessex will not have great numbers,
I am hearing.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.360
-We shall be marching to fight, Lord.
-Lord King--

26:05.440 --> 26:09.360
Do not believe there is another option.
Haesten and Cnut are men without honor.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.120
They will take your land, your silver
and the tin crown from your head.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.560
All of you, hear me.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.920
Yes, it is likely that the Danes
will have greater numbers,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.360
but this is a battle that we can win.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.640
Though it will take all of us,
every man and every sword,

26:31.720 --> 26:35.640
and we will fight with all the guile
and wit that Alfred has instilled.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.600
-God is with us.
-[people murmuring]

26:45.000 --> 26:46.800
I shall return to Mercia.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.480
Send word of your intentions, and soon,

26:49.560 --> 26:52.920
but, I warn you, I will not fight
a battle that cannot be won.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.160
I won't send my subjects into a slaughter.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.720
Do you wish to become a puppet,
Lord Aethelred?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.280
Send word.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.240
[Aethelhelm] Lord.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.080
[Edward] He's right.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.680
I am not my father.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.840
When Winchester fell to Guthrum,

27:29.360 --> 27:33.400
your father hid himself away
in the marshes, for months.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.560
He hid in fear for his life
and of failure,

27:37.360 --> 27:38.920
but he overcame that fear.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.520
We will find the words and you will write
to every ealdorman and thegn of Wessex

27:47.120 --> 27:50.360
and they will answer your call.
They will come.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.400
To where?

27:56.960 --> 28:01.160
Lord, if we have fewer men,

28:01.240 --> 28:05.040
the very last place we want to fight
is open ground.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.560
Bedanford.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.360
Bedanford is a good distance away.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.680
That is the path they would take.

28:15.120 --> 28:19.240
It is a long march, Lord,
but the land could be to our advantage.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.400
[Finan] It could, Lord.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.240
Bedanford it must be.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.520
Then I will do it.

28:33.760 --> 28:38.440
With your help, I will find the words.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.080
[Beocca] The devil cannot win.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.760
The devil will not win.

28:51.920 --> 28:56.120
I will need a sword, or an ax. A shield.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.520
This is a battle I will not watch.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.320
I need to fight, Uhtred,
till I can fight no more.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.160
Lord Sigebriht.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.400
-You are leaving in the night?
-There is an army to raise.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.280
You have been sitting with Aethelwold
for some time.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.200
If you are questioning my loyalty, do not.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.840
I am Wessex,
as was my father and my grandfather.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.440
But you are not for Edward.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.840
That does not make me
a traitor to my country.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.800
-Then you will be there, in battle?
-I will.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.720
Wessex will need the men of Cent.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.960
A letter will soon find you.

29:51.200 --> 29:55.920
We will be there.
For the good of Cent, and for Wessex.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.280
Yes, for Wessex, Lord Sigebriht.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.280
You are one day Saxon,
the very next day Dane, Uhtred.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.960
I have not yet offered you my condolences
for Ragnar.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.400
Your brother deserved a warrior's death.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.480
I am sorry you will not see him
in Valhalla.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.640
This is where you belong, Aethelwold.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.680
Winchester?

30:23.760 --> 30:26.840
Standing on a stable floor
like a horse's turd.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.080
Will you be riding for Edward?

30:30.160 --> 30:33.160
I will be there
and I will be praying for a great victory.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.680
-For Saxon or for Dane?
-Do you care? You belong to neither.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.880
I did once fear you, Uhtred,

30:41.960 --> 30:45.800
but now I see you are nothing but a sword.
A lump of metal.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.080
Yes, you have reputation,
but that will fade.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.600
And you will die forgotten and unwritten.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.840
You will go neither to Heaven
nor to Valhalla.

31:08.920 --> 31:13.440
[sighs] This letter from Edward,
it had better be good.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.640
[Uhtred] A letter has been sent.

31:28.240 --> 31:33.520
It speaks out to every man in the kingdom,
demanding that he answers the call

31:33.600 --> 31:35.640
and joins us on the road to battle.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.960
It says that this will be a battle

31:39.040 --> 31:42.160
that will be spoken of
for lifetimes to come.

31:43.160 --> 31:47.800
It is a battle that no man can ignore,
no man can stand by and watch.

31:49.560 --> 31:53.600
Every man must find a weapon
and every man must fight!

31:54.720 --> 31:57.760
Wessex will always be the light.

31:58.520 --> 32:01.600
And no matter how heavy our swords become,

32:02.520 --> 32:03.960
we must fight.

32:04.680 --> 32:09.680
Fight! Fight and keep on fighting
until the victory is ours!

32:09.760 --> 32:11.240
[men cheering]

32:21.040 --> 32:22.560
We march!

33:05.080 --> 33:06.920
[Sihtric] Aethelwold is not with us.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.200
I wondered why the stench had gone.
No doubt he's making his way to the Danes.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.640
He may know of Bedanford.
He will tell them.

33:16.320 --> 33:20.320
Which is why we're heading
towards the woods. Beyond Bedanford.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.280
[Osferth] We are?

33:21.360 --> 33:23.800
We assemble at Bedanford as requested,

33:23.880 --> 33:26.760
but then we march on
to attack the Danes in the woodlands.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.960
A small advantage for our smaller numbers.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.720
You have the blood kept safe?

33:36.480 --> 33:39.520
I do, Lord. Always. And it is blessed.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.240
Thyra's blood?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.200
[Uhtred] Yes.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.920
And it will save Ragnar's soul?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.680
It will take him
from Niflheim to Valhalla, yes.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.480
From Hell into Heaven.

33:59.520 --> 34:03.440
I must kill the man who killed Ragnar,
with a blade marked with Ragnar's blood.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.520
Thyra's blood.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.680
It is the same.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.159
Who is this man you will kill?

34:13.520 --> 34:14.600
I do not know.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.280
[Brida] So Uhtred lives?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.680
-Now rides with Edward?
-Yes.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.080
You were supposed to kill him.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.800
And I did not.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.520
Could you not find him sleeping?

35:32.200 --> 35:34.720
It barely matters
because Wessex is broken.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.240
Half the ealdormen
will not answer Edward's call

35:37.320 --> 35:39.320
and in one that will, we have an ally.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.480
Sigebriht of Cent.

35:42.680 --> 35:46.000
He commands one of the greatest armies
of Wessex and he is with us.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.240
He is? Then he will join us when?

35:51.880 --> 35:53.320
He will join us in battle.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.720
My plan is that he will arrive
to attack the Saxons from the rear,

35:57.800 --> 35:58.920
once battle has begun.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.200
Good.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.120
-[Brida] Jackdaw?
-[Jackdaw] What?

36:16.040 --> 36:19.120
Cnut will be sending out spies
in search of the Saxon camp.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.280
You will follow.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.080
I will?

36:22.160 --> 36:24.320
You will find Uhtred
and give him a message.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.760
[Edward] Still no word
from Lord Sigebriht.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.400
I'd hoped some men would be here already.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.840
[Uhtred] They will come.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.800
We must continue on to the woodland
and begin the fight.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.080
We cannot allow them into open ground.

36:56.680 --> 37:00.320
Then this may well be
the place we die, Uhtred.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.480
Or it may well be the place
you become king, Lord.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.680
A great king,
like your father at Ethandun.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.200
[horses neigh]

37:21.120 --> 37:24.520
[Finan] There is nothing more useless
than a dead spy.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.360
[Sihtric] Finan?

37:41.240 --> 37:42.200
Jackdaw?

37:42.280 --> 37:43.920
He says he has a message, Lord.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.920
I do, Lord. It's from Brida.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.480
Say it.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.640
Am I to be spared?

37:54.160 --> 37:57.520
Yes, you will be spared, but you will not
be returning to the Danes.

37:58.040 --> 37:58.920
Say your message.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.880
She says, "Aethelwold," Lord.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.080
She says, "Do not fail."

38:16.680 --> 38:18.360
How long before they come?

38:19.720 --> 38:20.640
They are near.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.240
You are facing death, for certain.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.480
You are wrong, Jackdaw. I will not die.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.360
Osferth!

38:33.800 --> 38:34.960
The blood.

38:50.600 --> 38:55.600
[Edward] Today, I ask you
not to fight for Alfred.

38:56.880 --> 39:00.160
I ask you not to fight for Edward,
nor the crown.

39:01.120 --> 39:05.240
But to fight for yourselves.
And your forefathers!

39:06.200 --> 39:11.400
They are buried in the soil
of Wessex and Mercia,

39:11.480 --> 39:13.200
and they have become the soil.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.560
They are the land. And even as I speak...

39:19.840 --> 39:23.720
it is for them we are fighting!

39:23.800 --> 39:25.120
[men shouting]

39:52.840 --> 39:53.960
[indistinct yelling]

39:56.480 --> 39:58.520
[men screaming]

40:26.680 --> 40:30.160
They're attacking the rear!
Defend the line! Move!

40:30.240 --> 40:34.440
Everyone! Attack! Attack!

40:34.520 --> 40:35.640
Move! Now!

40:44.360 --> 40:46.760
Kill every shit-eating Saxon bastard!

40:50.320 --> 40:52.840
[Finan] Uhtred,
there's too many of the bastards!

41:01.080 --> 41:03.040
Keep your ground!

41:04.440 --> 41:06.240
[Sihtric] Where are the Mercians?

41:26.560 --> 41:30.360
[grunts] Uhtred, the line is breaking!

41:31.480 --> 41:33.360
[Uhtred] Push back!

41:37.760 --> 41:39.280
Where is Sigebriht?

41:52.480 --> 41:54.440
Lord! Horses!

41:54.520 --> 41:55.560
Horses!

41:56.560 --> 41:59.960
It is Aethelflaed! It is Mercia!

42:14.600 --> 42:18.000
They are holding firm! Aethelwold!
When will your man attack?

42:18.080 --> 42:21.200
Soon! When they are tired! Very soon!

42:39.160 --> 42:42.440
There! There! There he is! Did I not say?

42:43.200 --> 42:45.000
What position is he taking?

42:58.880 --> 43:01.760
-For our forefathers!
-[men shouting]

43:05.720 --> 43:08.320
[Sigebriht] And for Wessex!

43:09.320 --> 43:11.440
[Haesten] Is he joining our line?

43:17.920 --> 43:19.400
That is your man!

43:20.920 --> 43:23.240
That is your man.
And he's fighting for Edward!

43:23.320 --> 43:27.200
He has betrayed us!
We still have the numbers!

43:27.280 --> 43:29.840
-[Haesten] That is your man!
-[man shouting]

43:33.200 --> 43:35.440
Push! With me!

43:37.240 --> 43:39.320
[men grunting]

43:40.320 --> 43:43.880
Fight! Stand your ground and fight!

43:58.640 --> 44:00.000
We have been betrayed.

44:13.720 --> 44:14.560
[grunts]

45:33.280 --> 45:35.960
-They are possessed by devils!
-[grunting]

45:36.040 --> 45:36.960
It is lost.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.760
[groaning]

46:32.040 --> 46:34.800
[panting]

46:52.160 --> 46:53.160
Uhtred, please.

46:57.760 --> 46:59.120
My arm is broken.

47:00.680 --> 47:02.400
I have no way of wielding a sword.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.680
You have another arm.

47:03.760 --> 47:07.760
Please. I will go north, east or west.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.760
I will go to Frankia. To Ireland, even--

47:11.840 --> 47:12.760
You killed Ragnar.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.720
-No. No, I didn't. I couldn't.
-You killed him.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.400
-Never.
-Admit your guilt.

47:17.480 --> 47:21.080
I am guilty of nothing more
than wanting what is rightly mine.

47:21.160 --> 47:24.280
-Admit it.
-We are the same, our kingdoms stolen.

47:24.360 --> 47:28.000
You killed my brother! Admit it to me!

47:33.360 --> 47:34.200
Yes.

47:35.840 --> 47:40.720
Or he would have killed me.
It was a war of sorts between us.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.960
I am not worth it.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.080
I swear you will never see me again.
I will go anywhere,

47:53.200 --> 47:54.760
travel as far away as you wish.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.360
Please.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.040
[crying] Please.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.680
Please, please.

48:06.240 --> 48:10.120
Uhtred... Uhtred, please.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.960
You will need silver to travel.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.400
A ship's fare.

48:25.480 --> 48:26.320
Yes.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.120
I would.

48:30.520 --> 48:31.400
Not much.

48:34.280 --> 48:36.560
You will never see this face again.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.960
[gasping]

48:46.360 --> 48:48.080
You will go to Hell.

49:08.720 --> 49:09.560
[Brida] Uhtred?

49:12.200 --> 49:14.480
Look, a bridge.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.320
He's crossing to Valhalla.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.240
He's free.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.240
[Uhtred] It will be written
in the Saxon chronicle

49:59.320 --> 50:03.040
that Edward did gain a great victory
over the Danes,

50:03.800 --> 50:06.800
ensuring he would become King of Wessex.

50:08.200 --> 50:10.040
But other battles lie ahead,

50:10.120 --> 50:13.520
both with the Danes
and within Wessex itself.

50:15.040 --> 50:21.320
A king must decide who he can trust
and who he must discard.

50:25.080 --> 50:30.320
He must understand the minds
of both his enemies and his friends.

50:31.600 --> 50:38.040
He must recognize that the truth of a man
lies not in the land of his birth,

50:39.320 --> 50:40.880
but in his heart.

50:48.760 --> 50:51.880
A king must be a king on his own terms.

50:52.480 --> 50:56.840
He cannot be his father.
He can only be himself.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.080
The chronicle will grow.
Pages will be added.

51:07.720 --> 51:11.200
But Uhtred of Bebbanburg
will not be mentioned.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.640
Although I, too, was victorious.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.280
My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.520
My name is Uhtred Ragnarson.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.640
Destiny is all.
