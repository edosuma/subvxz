WEBVTT

00:02.565 --> 00:06.283
Great soldier. But tends to be
more maverick than the Army accepts.

00:06.296 --> 00:08.323
We're going to be heading a couple
of hundred kilometres from here,

00:08.336 --> 00:09.993
nearer the epicentre of the earthquake.

00:10.018 --> 00:12.759
We'll be working closely with
the NGO's on the ground there.

00:13.003 --> 00:15.531
Tara lost her family in the 2015 quake.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.138
I need $1,000 now.

00:17.695 --> 00:20.155
- Whoa!
- I want that money!

00:20.178 --> 00:23.491
- Sharpen up or go home! There's
a great, big world out there

00:23.512 --> 00:25.537
just waiting for Tara
to take it by storm.

00:25.564 --> 00:27.003
I'm not interested in you.

00:27.019 --> 00:29.261
Yeah, well, I don't believe
that, neither do you.

00:33.572 --> 00:34.887
Milan?

00:38.126 --> 00:41.188
Kingy, get everyone here
now. Roll call, ASAP!

00:47.261 --> 00:48.770
Guys, on me, now!

00:51.579 --> 00:52.883
Everyone OK?

00:52.915 --> 00:54.688
- Yes, boss.
- Fingers, come on!

00:54.715 --> 00:56.445
Last man, Sarn.

01:12.548 --> 01:13.906
Milan!

01:17.562 --> 01:18.940
Milan!

01:23.759 --> 01:25.413
Oh, Milan!

01:30.447 --> 01:31.902
Are you OK?

01:33.152 --> 01:34.936
Just... just my eyes.

01:39.889 --> 01:41.043
Here.

01:54.602 --> 01:57.022
Keep as still as you can, Georgie.

02:32.888 --> 02:34.014
Boss?

02:36.278 --> 02:37.426
Er...

02:37.905 --> 02:39.862
- everyone here?
- Boss.

02:40.050 --> 02:42.524
Medic in the med centre, but everyone
else present and correct, sir.

02:42.567 --> 02:45.165
- Brains, go and get her now.
- Boss.

02:47.332 --> 02:50.191
I'm not being funny,
but how do they cope?

03:05.348 --> 03:07.154
I can't find the medic, boss.

03:07.175 --> 03:08.360
What?

03:08.646 --> 03:10.580
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.494
Who last had eyes on Lane?

03:17.872 --> 03:19.872
I thought she'd be back, boss.

03:20.082 --> 03:21.930
Spit it out, Richards.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.218
She was heading off to source
some diesel with the dude.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.748
Thapa, my medic's gone missing,
let's search for her right away.

03:33.275 --> 03:34.661
Couple of buildings razed to the ground

03:34.677 --> 03:36.019
down the bottom end of the village,

03:36.046 --> 03:38.536
- but there's no reason to presume...
- Look, let's kit up

03:38.572 --> 03:40.401
and cut away in your
search teams, now. Kingy!

03:40.454 --> 03:43.942
Right, Alpha team, zone
one. Bravo team, zone two.

03:43.963 --> 03:45.478
- Let's go.
- Boss!

03:55.011 --> 03:56.763
They'll be out looking for us.

03:56.957 --> 03:58.509
They don't know where we are.

03:59.152 --> 04:01.171
They'll come and find us, Milan.

04:03.090 --> 04:04.237
Milan,

04:04.357 --> 04:07.752
I guarantee they'll be out
looking for us. It's what we do.

04:13.707 --> 04:15.881
- Georgie!
- Lane!

04:17.173 --> 04:18.666
Georgie!

04:19.345 --> 04:20.761
Georgie!

04:26.092 --> 04:27.763
Will they really come?

04:27.973 --> 04:29.337
Yes.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.317
We never leave a man down.

04:32.393 --> 04:34.571
We don't even know if they've survived.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.112
Don't think like that.

04:45.518 --> 04:49.398
♪ I vow to thee, my country ♪

04:49.682 --> 04:53.032
♪ All earthly things above ♪

04:53.371 --> 04:57.758
♪ Entire and whole and perfect ♪

04:57.792 --> 05:00.511
♪ The service of my... ♪

05:04.236 --> 05:05.772
Is it an army song?

05:05.892 --> 05:07.028
No.

05:08.138 --> 05:09.842
No, it's a hymn.

05:11.738 --> 05:13.802
I guess we've adopted it.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.700
Not sure it'll make number one.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.162
It's no One Direction.

05:26.666 --> 05:28.752
You know when the aftershocks struck,

05:29.361 --> 05:30.701
and we fell?

05:32.325 --> 05:34.632
A million thoughts ran through my mind.

05:37.922 --> 05:40.027
All those things I should have said.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.789
All those things I shouldn't have said.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.796
I wish we'd met...

05:49.174 --> 05:50.341
years ago.

05:52.008 --> 05:53.345
Oh, no.

05:53.965 --> 05:55.884
You wouldn't have liked me years ago.

05:56.838 --> 05:58.212
Why?

06:05.784 --> 06:07.029
Milan,

06:07.444 --> 06:09.325
we ARE getting out of here.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.745
- Anything?
- No.

06:19.656 --> 06:21.187
Lane!

06:30.310 --> 06:34.589
♪ Entire and whole and perfect... ♪

06:34.842 --> 06:36.734
- Guys!
- What?

06:36.744 --> 06:39.229
Inform Zero, Monk,
I've bloody found her!

06:39.256 --> 06:42.727
Right, on it! Hello,
Zero, this is Alpha.

06:54.357 --> 06:55.645
Lane?

06:56.642 --> 06:59.445
- Can you hear me?
- Richards? Richards?

06:59.446 --> 07:01.035
What's the situation in there?

07:01.643 --> 07:04.176
The roof is about to go. Stay out.

07:04.187 --> 07:05.275
Injuries?

07:05.286 --> 07:07.167
No. Both superficial injuries.

07:07.189 --> 07:11.414
Don't come in on your own.
Stay out, that is an order!

07:14.866 --> 07:16.598
If the frigging lot comes down,

07:16.609 --> 07:18.791
you'll be able to find me.
I'll be at the end of this rope.

07:18.818 --> 07:20.545
Just wait, Maisie.
They'll be here any minute.

07:20.549 --> 07:21.890
They'll need someone inside to assess,

07:21.895 --> 07:24.167
- so I might as well be on the front foot.
- Just wait, Maisie, please.

07:24.188 --> 07:26.138
They'll be here with kit any second now!

07:29.613 --> 07:31.803
All right, but I'm
holding the frigging rope.

07:42.526 --> 07:44.354
Private Richards!

07:44.587 --> 07:45.742
Slowly.

07:46.009 --> 07:47.851
Don't worry about that, fella.

07:47.971 --> 07:52.847
Slowly, slowly... catchy Georgie.

07:57.512 --> 07:58.853
Are you OK?

07:59.228 --> 08:00.311
Yeah.

08:01.416 --> 08:03.281
Move this, I can't breathe.

08:25.541 --> 08:29.142
- No, keep your helmet on, Richards!
- Excuse me a sec, mentor.

08:29.159 --> 08:31.547
Do you mind if I get you out, my way?

08:31.667 --> 08:34.587
And you can court martial
me later, yeah? Agreed ?

08:35.734 --> 08:36.837
Shit!

08:36.957 --> 08:38.351
There you go.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.424
How good am I ?

08:41.115 --> 08:42.434
What's the rope for?

08:42.554 --> 08:43.974
We get pancaked,

08:44.094 --> 08:46.146
they'll be able to drag
us out under the door.

08:46.194 --> 08:47.975
If we get pancaked together,

08:48.095 --> 08:50.455
does that mean I'm spending
eternity with you, Richards?

08:52.376 --> 08:53.588
Ready?

09:01.946 --> 09:03.258
- You good there, Rab?
- Yep.

09:06.233 --> 09:07.475
Come on, come on.

09:09.769 --> 09:11.869
You are a nutter Maisie, you know that?

09:14.318 --> 09:15.727
Hi, Rab.

09:15.926 --> 09:17.150
Take your time.

09:19.288 --> 09:20.784
Nice one, Milan.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.906
You OK?

09:29.967 --> 09:31.525
Well done, Richards.

09:33.024 --> 09:35.529
I dunno what you were
doing in there, mind you.

09:37.946 --> 09:39.490
I'll let that pass.

09:52.471 --> 09:54.355
Lane? Is everyone OK?

09:54.475 --> 09:55.665
Yes, boss.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.576
Right, Kingy, get the
med kit down there.

09:58.313 --> 09:59.785
Everyone get down!

10:11.117 --> 10:12.122
Shit, man!

10:12.157 --> 10:13.364
Are you OK?

10:14.885 --> 10:17.899
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

10:19.386 --> 10:21.301
- ls everybody OK?
- Yes, boss.

10:21.327 --> 10:23.789
- Lane, are you all good?
- Yes, boss.

10:24.061 --> 10:25.699
Richards found a way in.

10:25.936 --> 10:27.708
Couldn't afford to wait, boss.

10:27.730 --> 10:31.123
I got her out just before the final
moment of a massive Kerplunk game.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.594
Let's get you out.

10:39.374 --> 10:40.638
Richards.

10:40.853 --> 10:42.686
Apart from the shit attempt at humour,

10:43.035 --> 10:44.190
good work today.

10:44.531 --> 10:46.053
Thank you, boss.

11:15.596 --> 11:18.631
_

11:19.768 --> 11:23.162
_

11:25.584 --> 11:26.891
_

11:35.109 --> 11:36.616
You're going to have a decent scar.

11:36.736 --> 11:38.515
Something to remember you by.

11:43.066 --> 11:44.534
I could have got us both killed.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.043
I'm sorry.

11:48.076 --> 11:50.465
Someone wanted us to
carry on with our journey.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.360
That really hurts.

11:58.156 --> 12:00.051
I'll find you a "brave boy" sticker.

12:00.547 --> 12:02.534
Think that's a Western thing.

12:06.316 --> 12:07.394
Lane.

12:10.854 --> 12:11.985
You OK?

12:12.506 --> 12:15.493
Yeah. Take more than a collapsed
building to stop me, boss.

12:16.144 --> 12:17.624
You had me worried there for a minute.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.758
You're getting quite
caring in your old age.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.186
I'll be back on duty tonight,
boss, at the orphanage.

12:24.220 --> 12:25.768
I'll sleep up there with the kids.

12:26.031 --> 12:27.920
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll get better sleep there

12:27.933 --> 12:30.119
than I would dossing with a
load of hairy-arsed squaddies.

12:32.146 --> 12:33.931
What were you doing up
at the building anyhow?

12:34.306 --> 12:35.595
Not another goat?

12:36.535 --> 12:37.902
Something like that.

12:40.153 --> 12:41.550
Make a note to yourself, Lane.

12:42.192 --> 12:43.725
Don't be a twat again.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.263
Already written it, boss.

12:46.928 --> 12:49.183
You're lucky your mentee
was there to help you out.

12:52.890 --> 12:54.481
Glad you survived, Lane.

13:02.336 --> 13:03.491
Are you OK?

13:03.953 --> 13:05.035
Yes.

13:06.646 --> 13:09.403
I'd been saving this for
a special celebration.

13:09.466 --> 13:11.706
Open it and eat it now. That's an order.

13:12.107 --> 13:13.654
Like you bother with orders.

13:26.036 --> 13:27.981
My family died.

13:28.365 --> 13:30.585
In the earthquake before.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.311
And now my house has gone.

13:34.431 --> 13:36.415
Everything has gone.

13:39.506 --> 13:40.696
Not everything.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.460
You're still here.

13:48.466 --> 13:50.855
We don't have earthquakes
where we're from.

13:50.856 --> 13:53.995
You also don't have mountains
as sick as that in Leeds.

13:56.980 --> 13:58.514
Wondered where this was.

13:58.540 --> 13:59.995
I found it.

14:01.356 --> 14:03.254
You can look after it
for me while I'm here.

14:03.318 --> 14:04.573
Take some photos.

14:05.046 --> 14:06.047
Rab.

14:06.741 --> 14:07.965
Are you mad?

14:08.224 --> 14:10.569
It's on airplane mode,
I know what I'm doing.

14:11.289 --> 14:13.915
My number is in there, OK?

14:13.916 --> 14:17.989
So, in an emergency, you just
flick it out of airplane mode.

14:18.236 --> 14:19.684
Don't be wracking up a big bill.

14:19.856 --> 14:21.055
Photos only.

14:21.503 --> 14:24.017
Hide it so no-one else sees.

14:24.886 --> 14:25.893
OK.

14:34.519 --> 14:37.050
You're actually quite a
nice person on the quiet.

14:37.981 --> 14:40.762
And you're actually quite a nice
person just pretending to be a knob.

14:41.629 --> 14:44.151
Yeah "nice" don't exactly
get you anywhere, does it?

14:44.349 --> 14:46.095
Tara's "nice" and here she is,

14:46.315 --> 14:47.441
clinging to a fucking rock,

14:47.462 --> 14:49.251
waiting for the next
earthquake to kill her.

14:49.371 --> 14:50.972
Rock with a view, though, eh?

14:54.878 --> 14:57.795
Stop looking at me, you wanker.

14:59.423 --> 15:00.940
You trying to hit on me?

15:01.820 --> 15:03.298
Course I fucking am.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.540
Right. Bed.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.395
Best offer I've had all day.

15:09.096 --> 15:10.339
All week, then.

15:13.126 --> 15:14.207
Mais!

15:16.385 --> 15:17.535
Maisie.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.068
Have you got any reception, Kingy?

15:38.805 --> 15:40.440
Just looking at photos.

15:41.255 --> 15:42.389
Homesick?

15:42.963 --> 15:45.066
I just like to say goodnight
to the kids, that's all.

15:54.756 --> 15:55.988
You all right, boss?

15:56.306 --> 15:58.123
This fucking place, Kingy.

15:58.243 --> 15:59.278
What do you mean?

15:59.632 --> 16:00.740
What do I mean?

16:02.016 --> 16:03.775
This fucking place.

16:05.590 --> 16:09.160
I, arm... I prefer an enemy you can see.

16:10.815 --> 16:11.876
Eh!

16:12.208 --> 16:14.661
We do what we can and fuck off, boss.

16:16.524 --> 16:18.972
Well, that's the new
recruitment leaflet sorted, then.

17:08.297 --> 17:10.306
- Come for a walk?
- Sh!

17:29.032 --> 17:30.861
Shouldn't you be resting?

17:30.862 --> 17:32.415
I couldn't sleep...

17:32.692 --> 17:34.351
thinking about you.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.537
Whoever said romance is dead.

17:38.082 --> 17:39.481
Not me.

17:40.807 --> 17:42.322
Erm...

17:43.142 --> 17:45.034
I haven't brushed my teeth.

17:45.914 --> 17:47.781
I'll live with it.

17:56.272 --> 17:57.503
You're not...

17:57.758 --> 17:59.751
stepping out with anybody?

18:02.084 --> 18:03.353
No.

18:03.836 --> 18:06.531
No, I'm, I'm not...
stepping out with anybody.

19:04.799 --> 19:06.351
Do you reckon they drug the dogs here?

19:06.471 --> 19:07.842
Maisie's the dog expert.

19:07.869 --> 19:09.591
It looks like they've been on the puff.

19:09.621 --> 19:10.933
It's the whole Hindu thing.

19:10.970 --> 19:12.801
- They've properly bought into it.
- The dogs?

19:13.140 --> 19:15.301
If you never been kicked,
you don't know how to kick.

19:15.302 --> 19:17.308
Proper Hindu. Zen shiz.

19:17.499 --> 19:19.302
Look, these dogs have
got to be a bit peckish,

19:19.309 --> 19:20.909
but they're not even
bothering to eat chicken!

19:20.919 --> 19:22.302
Maybe they're veggies, Rab.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.752
Dogs can't be religious.
Stop talking bollocks.

19:24.781 --> 19:26.231
Learnt behaviour, Brains.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.522
No such thing as bad dog,

19:27.549 --> 19:30.327
- just a bad owner, according to my nan.
- Learnt behaviour?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.430
Although her poodle
can be a massive tosser.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.555
That's what I'm saying, Brains.

19:33.561 --> 19:35.786
We're all controlled
by learnt behaviour.

19:35.810 --> 19:37.145
Mind you, so can my nan.

19:38.370 --> 19:39.803
Listen in, fellas.

19:40.712 --> 19:43.010
Squad... holt.

19:44.219 --> 19:45.639
Squad, well advance.

19:45.832 --> 19:47.453
Right turn.

19:48.573 --> 19:50.632
Right, guys, shower, scoff.

19:50.752 --> 19:54.171
Briefing down at the bottom
end of the village at 0700.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.966
Fall out.

19:57.969 --> 19:59.003
Maisie,

19:59.967 --> 20:01.291
have you see Tara?

20:01.604 --> 20:03.146
They're up at the top, aren't they?

20:03.502 --> 20:04.426
Some are.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.227
Not Tara. I can't find her.

20:06.262 --> 20:07.772
Six of the kids have gone missing.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.057
- I'll send her to the med-tent when I see her.
- OK.

20:14.612 --> 20:15.690
Hi, this is Rab.

20:15.778 --> 20:17.076
Sorry I can't be there right now.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.509
If you can please leave a message...

20:18.792 --> 20:21.057
Straight to your soppy answer message.

20:21.268 --> 20:22.302
Airplane mode.

20:24.359 --> 20:25.632
No. Tara's smart.

20:26.053 --> 20:28.189
If she was in trouble, she'd
have clicked out of that.

20:28.271 --> 20:29.310
Guys.

20:33.484 --> 20:34.750
All right, guys, listen in.

20:35.018 --> 20:37.077
We need everyone moved to
the top end of the village.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.964
This entire section must
be vacated this morning.

20:40.347 --> 20:42.465
- Is that understood?
- Sir!

20:43.913 --> 20:45.140
Relax, guys.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.050
Do we need to clear the entire
bottom section of the village, boss?

20:51.097 --> 20:52.765
I mean, you're sure
we're not over-reacting?

20:52.812 --> 20:54.349
Weather turns and the rains come,

20:54.469 --> 20:56.493
the buildings that are left
are at risk of mud-slides

20:56.502 --> 20:58.357
and the people sleeping
outside will be washed away.

20:58.395 --> 21:01.189
- You want us on that now, boss?
- They're priority. Let's crack on.

21:02.208 --> 21:03.227
Boss.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.828
Thapa.

21:09.927 --> 21:11.421
Has anyone seen anything?

21:11.422 --> 21:12.470
Nothing.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.784
They're going to sweep around
the far side of the village

21:14.793 --> 21:16.198
and see if anyone has seen them.

21:17.650 --> 21:19.132
Milan, this is all my fault.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.437
- No, it's not.
- If we hadn't had been...

21:22.151 --> 21:24.235
I should have been in
there with those children.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.154
We'll find them.

21:26.409 --> 21:27.458
Come on!

21:30.308 --> 21:31.505
Tara!

21:32.242 --> 21:33.309
Mia!

21:33.782 --> 21:35.415
- Tara!
- Mia!

21:36.625 --> 21:37.844
Tara!

21:39.185 --> 21:40.217
Mia!

21:40.892 --> 21:41.945
What is it?

21:42.119 --> 21:45.210
- He's gone. Da Chand.
- Da Chand?

21:45.272 --> 21:47.303
His truck was seen heading
towards the main road.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.301
Well, he was never going
to hang around, was he?

21:49.302 --> 21:51.041
If he's gone back to Kathmandu...

21:52.964 --> 21:53.991
What?

21:54.976 --> 21:56.241
What, Milan?

22:00.029 --> 22:01.817
- You think he might have...
- This isn't London.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.401
I know this isn't London.
What's that supposed to mean?

22:04.402 --> 22:08.704
What it means is some people
will do anything for money.

22:09.702 --> 22:11.702
You really think he's
taken the children?

22:12.372 --> 22:14.191
Those children are worth something.

22:15.232 --> 22:18.062
I'm presuming that his NGO is
registered at his home address.

22:18.372 --> 22:19.858
- Although...
- What?

22:20.712 --> 22:23.161
This paperwork hardly looks official.

22:23.432 --> 22:24.668
Did you pay him cash?

22:24.868 --> 22:26.095
We had no choice.

22:27.526 --> 22:29.798
You don't have evil people in the UK?

22:33.564 --> 22:35.989
We have to go to Kathmandu
as soon as possible.

22:36.409 --> 22:38.431
We don't know he's gone to Kathmandu.

22:38.432 --> 22:40.451
With all due respect,
his options are limited.

22:40.452 --> 22:42.098
He's from Kathmandu and

22:42.739 --> 22:45.198
I'm sure the kids'll be moved
across the border into India,

22:45.215 --> 22:47.044
but he'll lay low first
and divide them up.

22:47.201 --> 22:49.125
Thousands of children
were trafficked that way

22:49.137 --> 22:51.264
- after the 2015 quake.
- Thousands?

22:51.324 --> 22:52.585
Tens of thousands.

22:55.158 --> 22:58.151
Boss, we can intercept them
before they even get to Kathmandu.

22:58.172 --> 22:59.385
We have got a job to do here.

22:59.386 --> 23:02.070
If we don't go now, chances are
those kids will never be found.

23:02.486 --> 23:03.931
They were in our charge.

23:04.051 --> 23:07.166
- We have a duty of care, surely.
- We have a duty of care here.

23:07.183 --> 23:09.810
But if we get Richards
driving, get a small team,

23:09.842 --> 23:12.150
- retrieve the kids and be back...
- We're the British Army, Lane.

23:12.154 --> 23:15.468
- We don't go on gut instinct.
- Corporal Lane is correct about your duty of care.

23:16.224 --> 23:17.892
You're the officer in charge.

23:18.419 --> 23:20.427
It's your personal duty.

23:24.732 --> 23:26.425
We'll deal with this correctly.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.362
Inform the Nepalese Police,

23:28.389 --> 23:30.661
they can intercept and
deal with the situation.

23:30.735 --> 23:32.184
Well, we can try.

23:32.608 --> 23:33.935
There's been an earthquake.

23:33.951 --> 23:36.642
All agencies are stretched
to breaking point.

23:39.142 --> 23:41.185
They're only an hour ahead of us, boss.

23:41.492 --> 23:42.718
That's all.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.061
One hour.

23:45.011 --> 23:47.007
Look, we're all ready to go,

23:47.639 --> 23:49.608
just waiting on your word, boss.

23:51.184 --> 23:54.544
I can send some guys in a follow
up vehicle to pick up the kids.

24:12.748 --> 24:14.335
- Here.
- No, it's fine.

24:16.692 --> 24:17.949
I'm sorry.

24:18.193 --> 24:19.886
I should be the one that's sorry.

24:19.923 --> 24:22.895
- This isn't your fault, Georgie.
- Yeah, it fucking is, though.

24:24.584 --> 24:25.783
I can't.

24:26.022 --> 24:27.100
Please.

24:37.153 --> 24:39.284
This is a bit like a foursome, yeah?

24:43.595 --> 24:45.614
This is harassment in the workplace.

24:45.615 --> 24:47.448
Try her again, Rab.

24:49.225 --> 24:50.495
What you saying?

24:51.318 --> 24:54.847
"Where are you, Tara?
Please tell us you're OK."

24:54.967 --> 24:57.788
Soon as she turns the phone
on, we'll get a notification.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.134
It's her!

25:10.590 --> 25:12.065
"I'm fine."

25:12.185 --> 25:14.857
Fine! She's obviously not
fine. She's being trafficked!

25:14.889 --> 25:16.471
Maybe she wanted to go with him?

25:16.502 --> 25:19.411
Message back, Rab.
Find out where she is.

25:19.459 --> 25:20.823
What do you mean?

25:20.887 --> 25:23.222
Lots of kids think they're
going for a better life.

25:23.342 --> 25:25.403
- "Where are you, Tara?"
- And maybe to some,

25:25.451 --> 25:27.680
a brothel in Mumbai is better.

25:28.391 --> 25:30.334
She's turned it off again.

25:31.172 --> 25:33.901
She's too young to be
making those decisions.

25:36.671 --> 25:39.118
We have the name Da Chand.

25:39.150 --> 25:40.429
Probably false.

25:40.434 --> 25:41.952
Possibly false.

25:42.335 --> 25:44.282
But the photograph is
a very good likeness,

25:44.309 --> 25:46.535
so perhaps you could
unearth other identities.

25:46.655 --> 25:49.994
And any other faux-NGOs
he's been associated with.

26:36.995 --> 26:38.646
Fucking hell.

26:56.011 --> 26:58.049
- Is it OK?
- Fine.

26:58.697 --> 27:01.277
There's going to be some damage
to the roads, by the looks.

27:01.565 --> 27:03.254
Can we get through?

27:03.255 --> 27:04.641
We should be able to from here.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.104
They're going to need to wait
for them trees to be moved.

27:08.150 --> 27:11.005
- What's happening? We heading back?
- Call it in, Rab.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.946
What do I say? We're heading back?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.539
And the following vehicle's stuck?

27:14.659 --> 27:17.224
Tell them that the roads
aren't damaged ahead

27:17.225 --> 27:18.971
and we're pursuing the target.

27:21.449 --> 27:23.084
Catching flies, Rab?

27:28.534 --> 27:29.899
Hi, this is Rab.

27:29.936 --> 27:31.698
- Sorry I can't...
- The phone's still off.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.821
Straight to his soppy answer message.

27:33.865 --> 27:36.188
Look, if I have to listen
to that one more time...

27:38.785 --> 27:40.556
Does he know everybody in Nepal?

27:40.805 --> 27:42.053
Yeah.

27:44.925 --> 27:47.286
Aye, do you feel confident to go on?

27:47.328 --> 27:49.005
Abso-fucking-lutely.

27:49.525 --> 27:51.961
Let's get the kids and hold Da Chand.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.829
We'll worry about the rest later, yeah?

27:54.005 --> 27:55.809
They think he's about 30 minutes ahead

27:55.836 --> 27:58.017
- but said his truck seemed slow.
- OK.

27:58.054 --> 28:00.305
My uncle's in the police in Kathmandu.

28:00.327 --> 28:03.024
I'll try to get him to call all
the petrol stations en route.

28:03.025 --> 28:04.950
If Da Chand is seen,
they can call it in.

28:04.997 --> 28:06.590
- Good call.
- Unless...

28:06.978 --> 28:08.458
Well, they're not going to send police

28:08.479 --> 28:10.025
to wait around on the off-chance.

28:10.145 --> 28:12.131
They haven't got the
resources, like you said.

28:12.305 --> 28:15.307
If they're asking the petrol
station to call in if they spot them,

28:15.358 --> 28:17.298
it might lead to Da
Chand being tipped off.

28:17.418 --> 28:20.011
We don't want some toe-rag
letting him know we're after him.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.960
No offence, Milan.

28:24.015 --> 28:25.485
If he's half hour ahead,

28:25.502 --> 28:27.413
we will be able to catch up
with him before Kathmandu.

28:27.421 --> 28:28.729
Police HQ, hello?

28:29.290 --> 28:32.084
- Hello, Police HQ?
- OK, let's go.

28:40.393 --> 28:43.420
Hit any of these at speed and
we could bollocks the vehicle.

28:45.514 --> 28:47.535
We're still gonna catch up
with him though, yeah?

28:47.595 --> 28:48.860
Yeah.

29:34.736 --> 29:36.842
- If we don't catch them...
- Zip it, Rab.

29:36.962 --> 29:38.795
Just saying. I mean...

29:38.867 --> 29:41.143
How the fuck do we
find them in Kathmandu?

29:42.323 --> 29:44.603
- Still no reply?
- Phone's off.

29:44.641 --> 29:46.230
It'll tell me when
the texts are received.

29:46.247 --> 29:48.794
And, after Kathmandu,
what happens to them?

29:48.862 --> 29:52.684
Taken across the border to work
as sex slaves in India. Mainly.

29:52.715 --> 29:55.512
Right, so we need to make sure
that the border control are alerted.

29:55.535 --> 29:57.380
There is no border control as such.

29:57.465 --> 29:59.375
Porous borders, as they say.

29:59.452 --> 30:01.006
Between Nepal and India.

30:03.431 --> 30:05.359
As soon as the phone's turned on again,

30:05.389 --> 30:06.786
I'll know where she is.

30:07.159 --> 30:08.212
How?

30:08.408 --> 30:10.246
I only did it as a joke
when you were asleep.

30:10.688 --> 30:13.334
- What?
- What? You put the tracker on?

30:13.584 --> 30:15.715
It was for a laugh, Rab, so chill.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.809
I just wanted to say,
"Get out of Burger King"

30:17.822 --> 30:19.529
or whatever to freak you out.

30:20.170 --> 30:22.264
Congratulations, you've freaked me out.

30:23.566 --> 30:25.847
Although I'm slightly
flattered you care so much.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.944
Mike two zero, this is Zero, over.

31:27.555 --> 31:28.954
Yes, boss.

31:29.409 --> 31:32.760
Why didn't you call in losing
the following truck, Lane? Over.

31:34.084 --> 31:35.875
We had no idea we'd lost the truck, sir.

31:35.901 --> 31:37.985
And by the time we did,
we were close to Kathmandu.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.105
Milan's uncle who is the chief of police

31:40.139 --> 31:42.372
had offered us an escort. Over.

31:44.285 --> 31:46.547
And how far are you
from Kathmandu? Over.

31:46.615 --> 31:47.906
An hour.

31:49.725 --> 31:52.789
Ten minutes, boss.
Police escorting us. Over.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.841
Roger that, please
keep me updated, over.

31:58.758 --> 32:00.575
Last text gone through and read.

32:00.766 --> 32:03.501
- I'm getting a location from the tracker now.
- Right let's go.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.554
Data roaming ain't going
to be cheap out here, eh?

32:07.063 --> 32:08.918
What? I am just saying.

32:28.305 --> 32:30.462
Do you think they have
aftershocks in Kathmandu?

32:30.582 --> 32:32.398
I left my crystal ball at home, Brains.

32:32.449 --> 32:34.151
For someone clever, you
ain't half thick, Brains.

32:34.177 --> 32:35.327
No, I'm just saying,

32:35.447 --> 32:37.925
there's tall buildings
there so, you know,

32:38.045 --> 32:39.220
way more dangerous.

32:39.246 --> 32:41.870
- You know what, if I was in change...
- Bloody hell,

32:41.912 --> 32:43.292
was that another aftershock?

32:43.878 --> 32:45.887
Oh, no, you're all right,
that was me shuddering

32:45.921 --> 32:48.984
- at the thought of you being in charge, Monk.
- Look, hear me out.

32:48.985 --> 32:50.273
If I was in charge,

32:50.294 --> 32:53.013
I wouldn't let no-one build
anything above one storey high.

32:53.064 --> 32:55.581
You get a bit of corrugated iron
on your canister from eight feet,

32:55.602 --> 32:57.224
chances are you'll survive.

32:57.283 --> 32:59.244
30 storeys high and
you're brown bread, mate.

32:59.509 --> 33:00.704
That's true.

33:04.090 --> 33:05.742
He's well out of his comfort zone.

33:06.892 --> 33:08.315
What's that supposed to mean?

33:08.616 --> 33:12.144
Done a lot of tours with the boss
man and I've never seen him so...

33:15.019 --> 33:16.734
This place, it's a head fuck.
Earthquakes. Aftershocks.

33:16.735 --> 33:18.115
Child snatchers.

33:18.235 --> 33:20.597
Yeah, well, they're snatching the
kids back, though, aren't they?

33:21.325 --> 33:22.865
I hope so, Kingy.

33:23.310 --> 33:26.529
Look, never in doubt, so let's crack on

33:26.774 --> 33:29.322
and give these poor sods
somewhere to sleep tonight.

33:29.385 --> 33:30.931
Come on. Let's go.

33:50.377 --> 33:52.331
What does he need to
discuss with the police?

33:52.649 --> 33:54.640
- We've got a building, so...
- Exactly.

33:54.683 --> 33:56.555
Let's just get in
there and get them out.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.776
Yeah well, we don't know whether
she's still there, though, do we?

33:58.798 --> 34:01.643
- Or what's happening to her if she is.
- Indeed.

34:02.055 --> 34:04.904
But our responsibility lies
with the welfare of the kids.

34:04.921 --> 34:06.903
But the longer these planks chatter...

34:06.904 --> 34:09.540
They can't do anything
until the uncle arrives.

34:09.599 --> 34:10.847
Is he that important?

34:10.880 --> 34:14.469
Milan's uncle genuinely is
some sort of high up official.

34:15.524 --> 34:16.583
It'll be fine.

34:18.342 --> 34:20.362
Let's just hope she's
still at the dwelling.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.043
Hurry the fuck up!

34:24.114 --> 34:25.984
Calm yourself, Richards.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.239
- Nepal time.
- I don't know why we needed to involve local plod

34:29.286 --> 34:31.426
when we could have just gone
in and got the kids ourselves.

34:31.443 --> 34:33.205
You've got a brain! Use it.

34:33.467 --> 34:34.530
Switch on.

34:35.009 --> 34:36.152
What?

34:37.654 --> 34:41.018
We need Da Chand arrested and for
the kids to be looked after properly.

34:41.571 --> 34:43.487
I'm just saying, if it were up to me,

34:43.607 --> 34:46.014
we'd be on our way back to the
village with the kids already.

34:46.054 --> 34:49.322
Look, if we storm that building,
us three, with no back up,

34:49.324 --> 34:51.841
and met with armed
resistance, then what?

34:54.297 --> 34:57.223
- I guess we're ying and yang.
- You reckon?

34:58.199 --> 34:59.945
You're like the head
girl and I'm like the...

34:59.961 --> 35:02.359
The girl sat at the back of
the class not listening? Yeah.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.485
I'm the one that's bunking
off actually living a life.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.363
You reckon I don't live a life?

35:09.265 --> 35:11.118
Think you're a bit too scared to.

35:11.494 --> 35:12.742
No offence.

35:15.904 --> 35:17.678
Yeah, well, you don't know me.

35:18.209 --> 35:19.793
Maybe I do.

35:27.154 --> 35:28.753
That the uncle?

35:34.144 --> 35:35.678
More bloody chatter.

35:35.731 --> 35:38.523
- We know the kids are there.
- We know the phone was there.

35:38.730 --> 35:41.468
Your Russian roulette soldiering
can only have one outcome.

35:42.063 --> 35:43.623
Eventually.

35:48.888 --> 35:50.643
What was that about Russia?

35:52.380 --> 35:53.511
What?

35:54.015 --> 35:55.310
Wanker!

35:55.968 --> 35:58.703
- Russian roulette.
- What is it?

35:59.349 --> 36:01.855
One bullet in a six chamber gun. Pft!

36:01.975 --> 36:03.919
She thinks that's how you soldier.

36:04.039 --> 36:06.723
She's proper up herself
for a northern Doris.

36:22.768 --> 36:24.234
- Yes, boss?
- So what's happening?

36:24.354 --> 36:26.816
We're observing and here
in a support capacity.

36:26.884 --> 36:28.594
Supporting who, Lane?

36:28.992 --> 36:30.929
Nepalese police operation.

37:00.808 --> 37:02.363
That's us!

37:08.063 --> 37:10.440
Thank you for assisting
us with the mission.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.398
You were assisting us.

37:12.462 --> 37:13.810
Of course.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.193
Right, shall we head inside?

37:17.080 --> 37:18.507
On me!

37:22.668 --> 37:24.894
_

37:25.014 --> 37:26.187
That's him.

37:31.488 --> 37:32.671
_

37:32.719 --> 37:34.927
_

37:37.060 --> 37:38.833
You are a very stupid man.

37:38.854 --> 37:41.472
- You've done a very stupid thing.
- Saving children?

37:41.475 --> 37:43.646
_

37:43.662 --> 37:45.074
_

37:45.100 --> 37:47.345
_

37:48.124 --> 37:49.722
Where are the kids?

37:50.374 --> 37:51.718
TELL ME!

37:51.761 --> 37:53.968
You, mate, need to be
taught right from wrong!

37:58.154 --> 37:59.467
Let's go.

38:05.934 --> 38:07.428
Tara!

38:08.225 --> 38:09.403
Tara...

38:11.330 --> 38:13.145
You've had us so worried.

38:13.405 --> 38:14.912
Are you OK?

38:18.214 --> 38:21.207
- We've got 'em back, Rab.
- Safe and unharmed.

38:22.746 --> 38:23.961
Guys.

38:25.018 --> 38:26.594
All children accounted for.

38:26.714 --> 38:28.409
They'll be travelling back
with our escort tomorrow.

38:40.681 --> 38:43.584
They can transport the children
back to the village in the morning.

38:43.649 --> 38:46.421
Major Thapa has arranged for us
to stay at the barracks tonight

38:46.591 --> 38:49.249
and we can follow the bus taking
the children back tomorrow.

38:49.274 --> 38:50.722
- That's good.
- Yep.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.053
Maybe I can show you around first.

38:55.019 --> 38:56.051
What do you mean?

38:56.094 --> 38:57.580
Well, this is my city.

38:58.014 --> 39:00.680
If you don't have to rush back
to the barracks, I can, erm...

39:01.750 --> 39:03.058
... give you a quick tour.

39:04.289 --> 39:05.329
Yeah.

39:07.222 --> 39:10.432
Yeah, I'm sure I can
follow the guys back.

39:12.649 --> 39:13.953
Half an hour.

39:30.784 --> 39:32.003
We can charge him...

39:32.004 --> 39:34.550
... with child
trafficking. And also fraud.

39:34.610 --> 39:37.060
Obtaining money under false pretences.

39:37.094 --> 39:39.022
- His NGO was fake?
- Yes.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.801
He is an opportunist,

39:40.958 --> 39:42.728
exploiting the disaster.

39:45.446 --> 39:46.724
Phone call for you.

39:47.064 --> 39:49.309
It's the Brigadier from Whitehall.

39:49.798 --> 39:51.356
Needed you urgently.

40:04.127 --> 40:05.660
She doesn't want to come back.

40:05.821 --> 40:07.635
- What are you talking about?
- Tara.

40:07.817 --> 40:09.125
The rest of them understand,

40:09.134 --> 40:11.608
but Tara is adamant she doesn't
want to come back to the village.

40:12.674 --> 40:13.773
OK.

40:19.035 --> 40:20.232
Did you get my phone back?

40:20.270 --> 40:22.652
She can hold on to it till
we get back to the village.

40:23.013 --> 40:24.924
Did you flick it back
onto airplane mode?

40:24.966 --> 40:27.713
I wish I could flick you
onto bloody airplane mode.

40:40.833 --> 40:42.574
They've arrested Da Chand.

40:44.113 --> 40:45.244
That means

40:45.732 --> 40:47.168
you need to come back home.

40:48.143 --> 40:49.222
No.

40:54.233 --> 40:56.563
I don't know what Da Chand promised you,

40:57.417 --> 40:58.576
but he was lying.

40:59.819 --> 41:01.433
You need to come back with us, Tara.

41:01.858 --> 41:03.842
Da Chand was lying to you,

41:03.843 --> 41:07.497
and he's going to prison
for a very long time.

41:08.125 --> 41:10.070
You belong back at the village.

41:12.325 --> 41:14.975
We need to get you back where
you can be looked after properly.

41:17.501 --> 41:19.162
Once you've finished your schooling...

41:19.221 --> 41:21.152
- They marry me off.
- No.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.855
No, not if you don't
want to be married off.

41:28.973 --> 41:31.329
You don't know anyone in Kathmandu.

41:31.686 --> 41:32.758
You're young...

41:32.862 --> 41:33.881
No.

41:42.053 --> 41:44.632
You do know where Da Chand
was taking you, don't you?

41:46.106 --> 41:48.123
You know you were being shipped to India

41:49.130 --> 41:50.769
to work as prostitutes?

41:52.064 --> 41:53.912
I'm getting a better life.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.555
It doesn't work like that, darling.

41:59.417 --> 42:00.776
Yes.

42:03.646 --> 42:04.805
Tara!

42:08.825 --> 42:09.893
Oi.

42:10.545 --> 42:13.152
Don't be letting people
put nonsense into your head.

42:13.839 --> 42:15.890
You need to come back home with us.

42:17.172 --> 42:18.705
Everything's going to be OK.

42:19.508 --> 42:21.783
We're going to go back to
the barracks here in Kathmandu

42:21.801 --> 42:25.015
and we'll have something
nice to eat together.

42:25.686 --> 42:26.931
Does that sound good?

42:27.402 --> 42:28.680
OK.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.591
OK.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.343
Right, guys, listen in for a minute.

42:52.154 --> 42:54.040
Finish what you're doing here,
then square your kit away.

42:54.307 --> 42:55.718
Briefing in 20 minutes, Kingy.

42:56.142 --> 42:57.251
Boss.

42:58.305 --> 42:59.718
What's going on, Kingy?

43:00.219 --> 43:01.639
Find out in 20 minutes.

43:01.868 --> 43:04.301
- Let's crack on.
- Sir.

43:14.979 --> 43:17.463
- I don't understand, boss.
- You don't need to, Lane.

43:17.811 --> 43:20.915
Stay in Kathmandu. I'll be
joining you in the morning

43:20.936 --> 43:23.229
for Da Chand's release. Is that clear?

43:24.176 --> 43:26.592
Yeah, but why's he being released?

43:40.341 --> 43:42.012
She's going to be all right, mate.

43:43.043 --> 43:44.565
I hope so, Rab.

43:45.028 --> 43:46.982
We got 'em. We saved 'em.

43:46.983 --> 43:48.318
We done our job.

43:57.623 --> 43:59.855
- Gob like the TARDIS, you.
- What?

44:00.458 --> 44:02.785
- I'm hungry.
- Remind me not to take you anywhere fancy

44:02.798 --> 44:04.106
when we're back in the UK.

44:04.118 --> 44:06.013
What makes you think I'd
be interested in going

44:06.038 --> 44:07.384
anywhere with you when we're home?

44:07.431 --> 44:09.376
Cos you fancy a piece of my arse.

44:10.497 --> 44:13.092
I could shag you whenever I wanted to.

44:13.133 --> 44:16.510
So, if I ever want to, you'll
be the first to know, OK?

44:17.015 --> 44:18.442
So, you saying you want to?

44:18.443 --> 44:20.526
I'm saying the opposite.

44:20.535 --> 44:21.855
You don't fancy me?

44:21.889 --> 44:24.764
- Remind me, when's your tenth birthday?
- Do what?

44:24.781 --> 44:27.706
The idea of you
slobbering all over my tits

44:27.727 --> 44:29.642
gives me the massive creeps.

44:31.383 --> 44:33.221
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

44:35.298 --> 44:37.166
Scoff's not as bad
as you'd think, medic.

44:37.752 --> 44:40.045
We all have a responsibility, Richards.

44:40.546 --> 44:43.242
- What have I done now?
- Filling Tara's head with nonsense.

44:43.243 --> 44:46.262
- Who has?
- You, telling her that anything's possible.

44:46.313 --> 44:48.431
A wonderful life in the West awaits her.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.414
- Prime Minister...
- Look,

44:50.436 --> 44:52.049
- I didn't exactly...
- You did,

44:52.406 --> 44:54.164
"exactly", Richards.

44:54.665 --> 44:55.737
Think!

44:58.554 --> 45:00.694
We got her back now, so problem solved.

45:01.193 --> 45:02.502
Well, thank God we did.

45:03.233 --> 45:04.574
Cos if we hadn't...

45:05.581 --> 45:08.426
Well, it don't bear
thinking about, does it?

45:17.695 --> 45:19.733
Yeah, but I thought we were
supposed to be going in the morning.

45:20.026 --> 45:22.762
- Yeah, well, now we're going now.
- Something's happened.

45:22.763 --> 45:24.994
- Like what?
- I don't know, that's why I was asking.

45:25.172 --> 45:26.199
Fellas.

45:29.626 --> 45:30.912
As you were, guys.

45:31.613 --> 45:33.262
We're flying direct to Kathmandu.

45:33.761 --> 45:35.264
Get a briefing at the barracks there.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.646
Let's move.

45:37.124 --> 45:39.423
All right, guys, grab
your kits and let's go.

45:45.135 --> 45:46.936
I couldn't live without my burgers.

45:47.056 --> 45:49.152
Look, I know you lot worship the cow.

45:49.153 --> 45:50.923
Hindus don't worship cows, you plank.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.308
Er, they do!

45:52.962 --> 45:54.923
I thought you was supposed
to be Muslim, anyhow?

45:54.936 --> 45:56.350
Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

45:56.470 --> 45:58.388
Did you not do Religious
Studies at school?

45:59.413 --> 46:00.651
Hated the teacher.

46:00.970 --> 46:02.294
Refused to listen.

46:02.472 --> 46:03.619
Sat at the back with

46:03.678 --> 46:06.221
Kylie Dunn practising
doing tattoos on my arm.

46:06.943 --> 46:10.658
Is it true they are
letting him out? Da Chand ?

46:12.403 --> 46:13.529
Who told you that?

46:13.554 --> 46:15.342
- A soldier.
- A soldier?

46:15.375 --> 46:17.987
So, we have to stay here, yes?

46:18.403 --> 46:19.520
You're safe.

46:20.225 --> 46:21.524
He's not going to get you.

46:21.838 --> 46:23.257
I know he's not.

46:25.261 --> 46:26.688
Do you feel better now,

46:26.943 --> 46:28.712
about going back to the village?

46:30.768 --> 46:33.910
- Well?
- There's a big world out there.

46:47.952 --> 46:50.066
I thought we were meant
to be confined to barracks?

46:54.453 --> 46:55.786
Ooh!

46:56.206 --> 46:57.782
It's not like her to be all...

46:57.783 --> 46:59.025
Naughty.

46:59.603 --> 47:01.373
You ARE fucking ten!

47:21.205 --> 47:24.321
It hit us two years ago and again now.

47:25.961 --> 47:27.641
How will it ever be repaired?

47:28.071 --> 47:29.190
Slowly.

47:31.415 --> 47:33.600
You can't solve all the world's ills.

47:34.999 --> 47:36.600
What you do is enough.

47:37.954 --> 47:39.130
Is it, though?

47:39.131 --> 47:40.450
It's a start.

47:41.768 --> 47:43.135
But all this,

47:43.475 --> 47:44.950
the children being taken...

47:45.992 --> 47:47.521
... not your fault.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.950
At least we've got them back, I suppose.

47:54.145 --> 47:57.388
Sir! $1 please.

47:58.493 --> 47:59.497
$1...

47:59.563 --> 48:00.680
Sir!

48:03.975 --> 48:06.785
- Have you ever seen a living goddess?
- Huh?

48:06.819 --> 48:09.337
Good price for you,
madam. Not expensive.

48:10.467 --> 48:11.900
Where are we going?

48:12.191 --> 48:13.924
To see a living goddess.

48:14.531 --> 48:15.716
Is this a joke?

48:15.796 --> 48:16.994
No.

48:17.673 --> 48:21.249
The Kumari, or Living Goddess,
will appear at that window.

48:22.425 --> 48:25.450
OK, so these are just ordinary
girls that have been chosen?

48:25.451 --> 48:27.510
And they're deified until puberty.

48:29.061 --> 48:31.689
So this is just a tourist thing, yeah?

48:31.723 --> 48:32.865
Traditional.

48:33.362 --> 48:36.531
The Kumari is believed to be the
incarnation of the goddess Taleju.

49:03.882 --> 49:05.770
These goddesses don't hang about.

49:29.476 --> 49:31.550
Maybe one day you'll show me your town.

49:31.551 --> 49:34.690
You can't move for living
goddesses in the Arndale Centre.

49:38.665 --> 49:39.922
Guess what?

49:40.500 --> 49:43.128
That top window is going
to open and a living god

49:43.132 --> 49:45.140
is going to pop his head
out and call last orders?

49:45.523 --> 49:47.020
It can be arranged.

49:54.610 --> 49:55.930
My house.

49:58.160 --> 50:01.549
Erm, I have got to get
back to the barracks.

50:02.228 --> 50:05.816
Are you sure you don't
want to be... spontaneous?

50:14.443 --> 50:16.660
Are you saying I'm not spontaneous?

50:18.745 --> 50:19.930
I have Nescafe.

50:22.018 --> 50:24.641
Is that a successful seduction
technique in Kathmandu?

50:24.960 --> 50:26.306
Has it worked?

50:59.392 --> 51:00.802
What is it, Richards?

51:02.177 --> 51:05.013
Just a heads up, boss
is arriving right now.

51:05.081 --> 51:07.557
You're going to need to
get back here, pronto.

51:09.816 --> 51:11.531
He said he was coming in the morning.

51:11.548 --> 51:13.076
I'll get you a taxi cab.

51:13.990 --> 51:15.225
Wait here.

51:18.252 --> 51:19.407
Taxi!

51:27.874 --> 51:28.906
Boss.

51:30.811 --> 51:33.020
I'm sorry, boss, I thought you
were arriving in the morning,

51:33.050 --> 51:35.067
that's why I didn't rush
back from my NGO dinner.

51:35.187 --> 51:36.744
I was invited. I...

51:36.761 --> 51:38.998
I just didn't call it in. I'm sorry.

51:41.358 --> 51:42.456
Lane.

51:43.235 --> 51:44.479
Boss?

51:45.423 --> 51:47.191
You are allowed to eat, you know.

51:47.456 --> 51:49.790
- Briefing at 0500.
- Boss.

51:51.757 --> 51:52.844
Come on.

52:00.253 --> 52:01.337
Elvis?

52:01.611 --> 52:02.766
Why are you here?

52:03.589 --> 52:04.650
A mission.

52:05.972 --> 52:07.301
You look flustered.

52:08.434 --> 52:09.695
Surprised.

52:10.647 --> 52:12.010
There's a difference.

52:14.914 --> 52:17.321
- 5am briefing.
- Yeah, I heard.

52:18.667 --> 52:21.077
- Goodnight.
- Night.

52:35.946 --> 52:37.156
Relax, guys.

52:41.641 --> 52:43.029
Mr Da Chand.

52:43.149 --> 52:44.536
Currently under arrest

52:44.953 --> 52:46.490
about to be released.

52:48.111 --> 52:50.965
A small cog in a larger wheel.

52:51.916 --> 52:53.170
Good morning, guys.

52:53.290 --> 52:56.342
We've been working undercover
in India and Pakistan,

52:56.462 --> 52:58.113
trying to locate a cache of weapons

52:58.134 --> 53:00.720
that were stolen from a UN
platoon on the Afghan border.

53:08.336 --> 53:10.660
Nine members of the platoon were killed.

53:13.851 --> 53:15.910
We know who ordered the attack.

53:16.909 --> 53:18.531
Aaban Omar.

53:18.769 --> 53:21.279
A Taliban commander currently
masterminding attacks

53:21.292 --> 53:24.490
on mainland Europe and, indeed, the UK.

53:25.983 --> 53:28.624
In the popular parlance, Aaban Omar

53:28.917 --> 53:30.272
is our most wanted.

53:32.352 --> 53:34.589
Intelligence knows the
weapons will be coming his way,

53:34.590 --> 53:37.019
they even have the name
of the designated driver.

53:40.207 --> 53:41.388
Da Chand.

53:43.051 --> 53:47.270
So, we're hopeful Da
Chand can lead us to Omar.

53:47.965 --> 53:50.126
We'll be supporting special
forces on this mission

53:50.207 --> 53:52.100
before returning to the village.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.161
Target released.

53:56.422 --> 53:57.934
Monitoring movement.

53:58.638 --> 54:00.730
We will follow at a safe distance.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.300
Vehicle on the move, boss.

54:05.724 --> 54:07.023
OK, Charlie, let's move.

54:07.143 --> 54:09.057
Right, guys, grab your kit, let's go.

54:23.077 --> 54:24.680
I'll see you in a minute.

54:26.435 --> 54:28.418
I do hate these early starts.

54:29.136 --> 54:30.702
Early bird catches the worm.

54:30.732 --> 54:32.591
The early worm not so lucky, though.

54:36.187 --> 54:37.715
So, you were surprised
to see me, were you?

54:38.246 --> 54:39.331
No.

54:39.728 --> 54:42.123
Oh, you thought they'd have
spooned me into a body bag by now?

54:42.441 --> 54:43.838
The day is yet young.

54:45.681 --> 54:47.168
Don't jinx it!

54:49.978 --> 54:52.390
They were on Ops in Pakistan.

54:52.823 --> 54:55.837
- It wasn't like I put in a request for him.
- I'm a soldier.

54:56.903 --> 55:00.310
I do what I'm told and work with
whoever I'm told to work with.

55:04.481 --> 55:06.674
I'm going back to the
village with the kids.

55:06.682 --> 55:07.961
We'll be back.

55:08.203 --> 55:10.237
Mission's complete
once the prefabs arrive.

55:10.674 --> 55:12.339
How long will this operation take?

55:12.407 --> 55:14.896
Well, we're just
supporting Special Forces.

55:15.842 --> 55:18.021
They're flying out now
we're following later.

55:32.263 --> 55:34.950
Milan, where the hell's Tara?

55:39.781 --> 55:41.610
Maya, where is she? Where's Tara?

55:41.951 --> 55:43.683
- She's gone.
- "Gone?"

55:43.882 --> 55:45.241
What do you mean, she's gone?

55:45.262 --> 55:46.613
I wouldn't go with her.

55:46.990 --> 55:48.171
Right, where's she gone?

55:48.230 --> 55:49.933
She doesn't want to go back.

55:50.137 --> 55:51.678
She wants to go to UK.

55:54.713 --> 55:56.616
Lane, let's go.

55:56.667 --> 55:59.211
- Tara's not there, boss.
- Well, then get someone local to have a look inside.

55:59.216 --> 56:01.627
She won't have got far.
We have to leave, come on.

56:04.099 --> 56:06.578
Milan. Find her for me, OK?

56:06.998 --> 56:09.355
- I will.
- Find her and look after her.

56:09.749 --> 56:10.900
You promise me?

56:21.932 --> 56:23.261
See you in Kabul.

57:09.691 --> 57:12.360
- You and Elvis?
- Yeah.

57:12.541 --> 57:13.783
We're done.

57:13.947 --> 57:15.711
You know she's got a
bloke back in Nepal?

57:15.720 --> 57:17.690
This mission is no riskier
than anything we've done before.

57:17.732 --> 57:19.627
I have a bad feeling, James.

57:19.972 --> 57:21.273
GET DOWN!

57:21.294 --> 57:23.850
Well, it appears to have
all gone Pete Tong, fellas.

57:23.851 --> 57:26.442
- They knew we were coming.
- I trusted you!

57:26.511 --> 57:28.490
Welcome to Afghanistan.
