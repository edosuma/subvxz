13:33.521 --> 13:35.564
I told you, you can't help me.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.994
Why don't you walk me
through what happened?

13:51.539 --> 13:52.581
[sniffles]

13:55.000 --> 13:56.544
When the fight started, I…

13:58.295 --> 13:59.421
I couldn't move.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.550
I couldn't breathe.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.468
Felt like…

14:05.052 --> 14:07.680
Like my heart was gonna jump
out of my chest.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.895
I knew there was something wrong before,
I just… thought I could handle it.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.648
Does this have anything
to do with that girl, Tory?

14:19.275 --> 14:20.943
First time seeing her since.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.322
I felt like it would all happen again.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.784
Like I would get hurt.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.537
And Miguel would fall.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.455
And Robby would run.

14:35.749 --> 14:40.546
[sobbing] My brain could feel it starting,
and so my body just… stopped.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.090
That must've been terrifying.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.092
Demetri got hurt.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.095
And I couldn't do anything to stop it.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.555
Sam, that's not on you.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.850
Cobra Kai is way out of control.
You know that.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.101
That's the problem.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.104
I'm scared, Dad.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.150
I've never felt so alone.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.068
You're not alone.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.281
No matter what you're feeling,

15:07.364 --> 15:09.491
it's nothing to be ashamed of,
you hear me?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.624
You up for a pit stop on the way home?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.210
[bell rings]

15:20.294 --> 15:22.296
-Hey, what's up, Moose?
-[student] What?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.385
[knocks on locker]

15:28.469 --> 15:29.595
Sensei?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.181
How'd you get through security?

15:32.264 --> 15:35.100
I went to school here.
Think I don't know secret ways in?

15:36.060 --> 15:37.728
Hey. Got some good news.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.814
Found a pretty sweet spot
for our new dojo.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.983
-Yeah?
-How's the recruiting coming?

15:45.986 --> 15:46.862
That bad?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.531
It's just everything's changed, Sensei.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.242
Cobra Kai, they…
They all drank the Kool-Aid.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.787
Kool-Aid? What's wrong with a Kool-Aid?

15:55.496 --> 15:59.333
It's just… Sensei Kreese is turning them
into an army of assholes.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.627
There's no convincing them to leave.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.757
Wait here.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.263
OK, listen up!

16:21.146 --> 16:22.189
I screwed up.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.483
And I'm sorry.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.652
I made it about me.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.947
And that's not what a sensei does.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.283
I took the easy way out.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.868
I gave up.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.456
What happened here at this school…

16:41.959 --> 16:43.544
it rocked me to my core.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.839
I couldn't look myself in the eye,
let alone face all of you.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.134
Yeah. I guess it makes it easier
to tell yourself that.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.471
But the truth is, you bailed on us
long before that fight happened.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.016
You got soft.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.892
And we paid the price.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.396
You listen up.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.316
When you came to my dojo,
you were softer than a baby's ass.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.737
-[epic music plays]
-I made you what you are, not Kreese.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.740
He doesn't give a shit about you.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.992
About any of you.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.787
If you wanna whine about the past
like a bunch of pussies, fine.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.039
We can play that game.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.125
Wanna stick with Kreese? Go ahead.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.754
Don't say I didn't warn you
when your life ends up in the shitter.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.840
Or you could sack up

17:30.632 --> 17:32.009
and join my dojo.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.514
Havenhurst and Magnolia, tomorrow at 4:00.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.894
If you wanna save yourselves,
train the right way…

17:43.270 --> 17:44.605
you better be there.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.526
And don't be late!

17:50.903 --> 17:52.321
Sorry, kid. Old habit.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.916
[sweeping music plays]

18:04.458 --> 18:06.960
[Daniel] No matter how many times
I come back here,

18:07.044 --> 18:09.922
I just can't help
but feel a little rush of adrenaline.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.134
That's great, Dad. But you still haven't
told me why we're here.

18:15.094 --> 18:15.969
Come here.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.148
Right here.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.028
I know.
This is where you beat Johnny Lawrence.

18:33.112 --> 18:33.987
No.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.157
This is where I almost lost to fear.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.828
What do you mean? When?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.039
It was during my second tournament.

18:44.998 --> 18:48.794
I didn't even need to fight
in the preliminary rounds, so I was fresh.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.712
I thought I was ready.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.924
But in the final match…

18:55.509 --> 18:57.177
my opponent was ruthless.

18:57.261 --> 19:01.098
Before I knew it, I was on that mat
and the fear had completely taken over.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.558
I was paralyzed.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.017
I couldn't move.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.603
The thought of getting up again
and facing that guy

19:06.687 --> 19:08.981
just scared
the living daylights out of me.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.150
I just wanted to run off and hide.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.656
So, what did you do?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.116
[Mr. Miyagi] Daniel-san!

19:19.199 --> 19:22.077
-Mr. Miyagi, it's over! Forget about it!
-No!

19:22.161 --> 19:23.162
I'm afraid!

19:23.245 --> 19:26.957
It's OK lose to opponent.
Must not lose to fear!

19:27.040 --> 19:28.959
-Yeah, well, I'm afraid!
-Hey!

19:30.460 --> 19:32.713
You stay focused.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.301
Daniel-san, your best karate
is still inside you.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.761
Now time, let out!

19:39.845 --> 19:42.681
Luckily, I had Mr. Miyagi
to help me get my focus back.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.267
I got up…

19:47.102 --> 19:49.104
and finished the fight, and I won.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.692
I guess Mr. Miyagi always had a way
of fixing things.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.862
There's no question
his advice was something I needed to hear.

19:58.071 --> 20:01.491
But ultimately, I had to be the one
to get up and do something.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.869
I still live with the fear, Sam.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.746
We all do on some level.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.665
I just try to not let it ever win.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.045
Sam, you're the only one
who can get up when you're down.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.338
No one else.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.340
I promise,

20:16.840 --> 20:17.883
I will be there…

20:18.717 --> 20:19.927
always to help you.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.513
Just like Mr. Miyagi was there for me.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.353
[bell rings]

20:31.688 --> 20:33.857
-[Kyler] Later, geek!
-[students laugh]

20:36.735 --> 20:37.611
Assholes.

20:39.905 --> 20:40.906
[clears throat]

20:41.740 --> 20:42.950
You have a marker?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.452
Uh, um...

20:47.246 --> 20:48.205
Yeah.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.207
Cast.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.379
[clears throat]

21:00.175 --> 21:01.260
[sighs]

21:06.515 --> 21:07.432
There.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.935
Much better.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.357
Wow. That, uh… That really…

21:15.440 --> 21:16.483
That, uh… It…

21:17.276 --> 21:19.027
Uh... Thank you.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.280
After the whole, you know…

21:22.281 --> 21:23.782
front wedgie thing…

21:25.701 --> 21:27.035
I know what it's like.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.913
Sucks to have everyone laughing at you.

21:32.416 --> 21:36.295
If it means anything, I've experienced
multiple back wedgies, and…

21:36.878 --> 21:38.505
well, they're no picnic either.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.928
OK. [clears throat]

21:45.762 --> 21:48.181
-Let's not make this a thing.
-Understood.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.018
-Mm-mmm. [giggles]
-[clicks tongue]

21:53.353 --> 21:54.980
[breathing deeply]

22:14.624 --> 22:15.876
I knew you'd be back.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.544
Oh, really?

22:18.128 --> 22:18.962
Yeah.

22:21.631 --> 22:22.632
Here, catch.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.260
What's this for?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.637
Thought maybe we could do some training.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.557
I mean, you know, if you want to.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.685
Show me…

22:34.478 --> 22:35.437
cast the rod.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.563
-What?
-[grunts]

22:37.814 --> 22:38.899
[chuckles lightly]

22:39.566 --> 22:40.734
Nice block.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.195
"Cast the rod."

22:44.029 --> 22:46.490
So the fishing trip
was karate training after all?

22:47.491 --> 22:49.618
More of a happy coincidence.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.453
[both grunting]

22:51.536 --> 22:53.372
[gentle music playing]

23:06.093 --> 23:06.968
Again.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.346
Come on.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.306
[suspenseful music playing]

23:11.390 --> 23:12.516
This is day one.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.062
We've been here before.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.524
But things are different now.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.944
They tried to tear us down.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.196
It didn't work!

23:28.198 --> 23:30.409
They said we needed a roof and four walls.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.744
Screw that!

23:34.413 --> 23:35.539
This park…

23:36.248 --> 23:37.541
will be our new dojo.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.628
'Cause you don't need a dojo to be a dojo!

23:42.671 --> 23:43.880
Is that understood?

23:43.964 --> 23:45.132
[all] Yes, Sensei!

23:47.467 --> 23:49.261
I started Cobra Kai with one nerd.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.306
This is a step up.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.436
And if we're gonna be taken seriously,

23:57.519 --> 24:00.397
we need a name that commands respect.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.776
A name that elicits power and dominance.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.736
Cobras are strong.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.158
They may be king of the jungle,
but the world's more than just a jungle.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.703
And there's only one animal…

24:15.495 --> 24:16.955
that can kill a snake.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.665
A mongoose?

24:18.748 --> 24:20.375
A real animal, Bert.

24:30.802 --> 24:31.803
Welcome…

24:32.387 --> 24:34.306
to Eagle Fang Karate.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.725
[eagle screeching]

24:37.225 --> 24:39.978
-[whispering in amazement]
-Uh, eagles don't have fang--

24:43.565 --> 24:44.691
Put 'em on!

24:53.283 --> 24:56.661
-Anyone else feeling a little snug?
-Do some more sit-ups.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.663
All right, everybody, fall in!

25:04.252 --> 25:05.086
Sensei, look.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.049
[chuckles] Still got it.

25:10.717 --> 25:13.887
All right. Looks like
our class just got bigger. Make room.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.617
I told you,

25:36.159 --> 25:37.327
Cobra Kai for life.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.046
Don't worry, Johnny.
I'm not here for a fight.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.090
Yeah? Then why the hell are you here?

25:50.173 --> 25:54.094
I'd like to make you an offer to come back
to Cobra Kai where you belong.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.514
You're crazy if you think
I'm ever teaming up with you again.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.475
The garbage you're feeding them,

26:00.559 --> 26:02.102
the shit they're pulling,

26:03.770 --> 26:04.938
it's messed up.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.692
You're to blame for that.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.444
I have to disagree with you there.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.905
I care about my students.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.992
They're strong and they're true fighters.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.121
And they wouldn't make the mistake
of showing mercy and ending up in a coma!

26:30.797 --> 26:34.134
This is it, Johnny.
There's not gonna be another chance.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.470
Good.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.267
You made your choice.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.063
And you are gonna regret it.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.652
[dramatic rock music playing]

27:08.251 --> 27:10.170
[electronic music plays]
