02:32.863 --> 02:34.990
Yeah, I like animals better
than people sometimes.

02:36.366 --> 02:38.243
Especially dogs. Dogs are the best.

02:38.535 --> 02:40.370
Every time you come through the door...

02:40.537 --> 02:43.081
they treat you as if they
haven't seen you in a year.

02:43.248 --> 02:44.833
The good thing about dogs...

02:45.000 --> 02:48.211
is they got different kinds of dogs
for different kinds of people.

02:48.378 --> 02:50.380
Like pit bulls.

02:50.797 --> 02:52.299
The dog of dogs.

02:53.425 --> 02:56.094
Pit bull can be
the right man's best friend...

02:56.386 --> 02:58.388
and the wrong man's worst enemy.

02:58.930 --> 03:03.268
Yeah, you gonna give me a dog,
give me a pit bull. Give me...

03:04.936 --> 03:07.022
"Raoull." Right, Omar?
Give me Raoull.

03:07.272 --> 03:11.026
I fucking hate Raoull!
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

03:11.193 --> 03:13.445
Son of a bitch don't
know when to shut up!

03:13.612 --> 03:14.905
Hates Raoull.

03:16.782 --> 03:18.075
Farley fucked up the list.

03:19.034 --> 03:22.954
Yeah, I can dig it, Omar.
I had a dog like that. A poodle.

03:23.121 --> 03:26.166
She didn't bark, though.
She pissed on the floor.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.627
Hated that dog.

03:28.794 --> 03:30.921
But if I was ever depressed...

03:31.129 --> 03:32.964
she'd lay her head in my lap...

03:33.256 --> 03:35.842
look up at me
with those big old eyes...

03:36.009 --> 03:39.096
and even though I thought
I hated that dog...

03:39.262 --> 03:40.639
I loved her.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.102
It's like that, ain't it, Omar?
That love-hate thing.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.813
No more goddamned talk!

03:48.355 --> 03:52.359
I can't wait anymore, you hear me?
I want my wife!

03:52.818 --> 03:54.361
I want her up here.

03:56.071 --> 03:57.864
Or I'll do our daughter.

04:00.367 --> 04:03.495
- Omar, listen to me.
- No more fucking talking.

04:03.662 --> 04:05.664
I want that bitch,
or I'll do the girl.

04:05.831 --> 04:08.250
Omar, I'm doing
the best I can here, man.

04:08.417 --> 04:10.502
I'm not gonna hurt her.

04:10.794 --> 04:12.838
I just want her to see me
blow my brains out.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.673
I want her to think about that...

04:14.840 --> 04:17.843
when she's sucking
that fat prick's cock.

04:25.016 --> 04:26.810
Roman's losing him.

04:27.686 --> 04:30.689
This guy goes, he could take
that girl with him. We gotta go in.

04:30.856 --> 04:34.526
We'll give Danny another minute.
Not yet. He's pulled out of worse.

04:35.444 --> 04:37.320
Another minute, that girl will be dead.

04:39.948 --> 04:43.785
Unit 1, prepare entry.
All units stand by for full breach.

04:51.501 --> 04:53.628
Get back! Get back!

05:00.469 --> 05:02.220
<i>You lost him. Make entry.</i>

05:02.387 --> 05:05.015
Beck thinks you lost him.
Frost gave him the go-ahead.

05:05.182 --> 05:07.058
That's not the play. Omar's tight.

05:07.517 --> 05:09.644
He can get a shot off if they breach.

05:09.811 --> 05:12.397
Look, Nate, I can still talk to him.
I just need time.

05:12.564 --> 05:16.485
- HBT 1, negotiator requests time.
- Negative. Team's in position.

05:18.111 --> 05:19.905
Fuck it. I'm going in.

05:20.071 --> 05:23.575
No. Don't, damn it. Don't pull this shit.
You'll give him another hostage.

05:24.075 --> 05:26.912
You know another way to get
the gun off the girl's head?

05:27.996 --> 05:31.082
- Negotiator entering kill zone.
- You better keep him out.

05:31.249 --> 05:33.376
Our men will lose objectivity
if he's in there.

05:33.543 --> 05:36.004
This is Frost. Stand down.

05:37.464 --> 05:40.592
- Omar was a Marine, right?
- Yeah.

05:40.759 --> 05:43.261
- We have a shot?
- Bedroom, but he's nowhere near.

05:43.428 --> 05:46.014
He will be.
Get Eagle and Palermo to that window.

05:46.181 --> 05:49.851
Tell them to wait for my signal
and put that motherfucker on his back.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.686
Hellman, Allen, Argento.

05:53.438 --> 05:56.274
When I'm clear, come in there,
get that girl.

05:57.484 --> 05:59.277
Yo, Omar.

06:01.738 --> 06:03.448
Just got word. Your wife's here.

06:07.702 --> 06:10.038
- Wife?
- Shut the fuck up.

06:10.205 --> 06:12.457
I've been authorized to make the trade.

06:12.624 --> 06:13.875
I gotta come in, look around...

06:14.042 --> 06:17.629
make sure there's no other hostages
and there's no surprises.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.090
Fuck you!

06:20.674 --> 06:21.967
I wanna see her first.

06:22.133 --> 06:26.638
Omar, I gotta come look. Then I can bring
in your wife, get the girl, all right?

06:26.805 --> 06:29.307
- What if you're lying?
- Then shoot me!

06:30.684 --> 06:33.270
Okay! Fair enough!

06:34.062 --> 06:35.730
Nice and slow!

06:36.773 --> 06:42.445
You look around, then I get my wife,
or you fucking die!

06:52.539 --> 06:55.500
<i>Palermo, Eagle, clear for shot.</i>

06:55.750 --> 06:58.295
<i>- Okay? Here we go.
- Ready.</i>

07:04.968 --> 07:07.512
Move real slow.
This ain't about me or you...

07:07.679 --> 07:09.973
but I'm gonna take you out
just the same.

07:13.268 --> 07:16.187
He's in.
We gotta play it out now.

07:16.354 --> 07:17.689
Unit 1, hold position.

07:31.870 --> 07:33.038
Lock it.

07:36.708 --> 07:38.293
Nice breeze.

07:39.669 --> 07:44.466
Great day to be out, you know?
Not cold. Cool, kind of brisk.

07:44.841 --> 07:46.885
Too bad we got stuck in here.

07:47.052 --> 07:49.638
You've seen everything.
No surprise. Let's do this.

07:49.804 --> 07:54.351
I gotta look in those rooms down there.
You know, make sure nobody's there.

07:55.226 --> 07:56.561
All right, move.

08:01.733 --> 08:02.734
Football?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.320
Perfect day for it.

08:07.906 --> 08:10.450
I ain't missed a Bears home game
since I left the Corps.

08:10.617 --> 08:13.203
Course, the Corps was a winning team,
wasn't it?

08:13.370 --> 08:15.205
Oh, yeah? You were in?

08:15.580 --> 08:18.375
Yeah. I did a tour in '73.

08:18.541 --> 08:23.713
Semper fi, motherfucker.
I did two tours. '68 and '69.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.674
Well, hoo-fucking-rah, Omar.

08:25.924 --> 08:27.300
Hoorah!

08:27.759 --> 08:31.096
Don't meet many Marines
these days. Everybody joins the Navy.

08:33.014 --> 08:34.765
I have a visual on the suspect.

08:34.933 --> 08:38.937
See? Nothing here, lieutenant,
so now we make the trade.

08:39.104 --> 08:41.438
- Nuh. Stay cool.
- We got a one count.

08:44.693 --> 08:47.112
Like I told you,
gotta check out everything.

08:53.201 --> 08:57.914
Omar. A Marine and a sailor
are in the bathroom taking a piss.

08:58.707 --> 09:01.751
The Marine goes to leave
without washing up.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.545
Sailor says:

09:03.712 --> 09:07.298
"In the Navy, they teach us
to wash our hands."

09:08.299 --> 09:10.343
The Marine turns to him and says:

09:10.510 --> 09:13.888
"In the Marines, they teach us
not to piss on our hands."

09:23.606 --> 09:25.483
- Down! Get down!
- Move! Move!

09:30.488 --> 09:33.658
- HT'$ down!
- Copy.

09:39.289 --> 09:40.331
You all right, bud?

09:40.874 --> 09:43.501
You okay?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.587
Yeah.

09:48.673 --> 09:50.258
- Thanks.
- Sure.

10:04.314 --> 10:06.024
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:44.062 --> 10:46.564
Yeah, boy! Come on.
Get down, get funky, get loose!

10:46.731 --> 10:48.733
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!

10:48.900 --> 10:50.902
You're a hoedown guy.

10:51.069 --> 10:53.905
Now I've seen everything..

10:55.073 --> 10:58.159
Okay, which one is
the most pathetic out there?

10:58.326 --> 11:00.078
- How you feeling, man?
- Not great.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.664
- I wanna talk to you. All right?
- All right, cool.

11:03.373 --> 11:04.457
Hey! Cut the music!

11:06.751 --> 11:09.379
Take a wild guess
who's on the news again.

11:09.546 --> 11:13.883
<i>After six hours, hostage negotiator
Danny Roman risked his own life...</i>

11:14.050 --> 11:16.261
<i>disarming the hostage-taker
to end the standoff.</i>

11:18.263 --> 11:20.723
<i>Lieutenant Roman,
looks like you saved the day again.</i>

11:20.890 --> 11:24.018
<i>No, it was a team effort.
I just talked the guy out.</i>

11:24.185 --> 11:25.979
<i>Well, did he say anything in there?</i>

11:26.145 --> 11:28.690
He just wanted to hog the spotlight!

11:29.107 --> 11:32.777
L just wanna tell you how close I came
to busting your ass because of that shit.

11:32.944 --> 11:35.947
But because it'll never happen
again, right, I'll let it go.

11:36.114 --> 11:37.448
All right, he's all talk.

11:39.284 --> 11:42.120
Danny, off the record,
that was one hell of a gutsy job, man.

11:42.287 --> 11:43.955
Again, congratulations.

11:44.205 --> 11:45.957
Thanks, chief. Congratulations to you.

11:46.124 --> 11:47.166
- Thanks.
- Great party.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.793
Were you really in the Marines?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.129
No, I was in the Army
and I fucking hate dogs.

11:53.298 --> 11:57.218
Despite how things worked out today,
you put these guys in jeopardy.

11:58.011 --> 12:01.097
If you were taken hostage,
you would've fucked up everything.

12:01.389 --> 12:04.809
Everybody lived, Beck. Even you.

12:12.150 --> 12:15.778
Twenty thousand cops in Chicago.
Can't you take turns?

12:15.945 --> 12:18.156
I was gonna let Nate go in...

12:18.323 --> 12:20.658
but I knew Linda would be pissed
at me.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.328
Nate's much smarter than that,
right, Nate?

12:23.494 --> 12:26.581
Yeah, I'm too smart.
I'm too smart for my own good sometimes.

12:29.042 --> 12:31.127
You got a minute? Gotta talk.
It's important.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.088
Just be a minute, I promise.
Just a minute.

12:35.924 --> 12:37.342
Go on, tell your secrets.

12:55.610 --> 12:57.362
I was approached by someone recently.

12:59.113 --> 13:01.699
He knows who took money
from the disability fund.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.451
What?

13:03.618 --> 13:05.620
- Almost <i>2</i> million is missing.
- Yeah, I know.

13:05.787 --> 13:10.124
According to him,
we know the guys who took it. Cops.

13:10.625 --> 13:13.336
Guys in our own precinct.
Guys we might call our friends...

13:13.503 --> 13:15.380
stealing our own money.

13:16.089 --> 13:18.675
I would've told you sooner,
but this is my first chance.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.510
Who told you this?

13:21.678 --> 13:22.720
I can't say...

13:23.554 --> 13:26.099
but this guy knows what he's
talking about.

13:26.265 --> 13:29.143
He's been around, working cases like this.
He knows his shit.

13:29.310 --> 13:31.187
So why didn't he go to Internal Affairs?

13:31.354 --> 13:34.857
Because he thinks Internal Affairs
is involved.

13:35.024 --> 13:38.069
He heard Niebaum's name mentioned.
He doesn't know what to do.

13:40.405 --> 13:42.699
They offered to buy him out.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.827
- And?
- And he said he'd think about it.

13:45.994 --> 13:49.414
We were at the academy,
worked Area 6 together, so he trusts me.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.249
This guy...

13:51.416 --> 13:54.085
Dan, this guy is really scared.

13:54.252 --> 13:56.713
When did you find out
about all this?

13:57.380 --> 14:00.800
Most of it last night, but I...

14:00.967 --> 14:04.053
I've been working on it
for a couple of weeks now, you know?

14:04.554 --> 14:07.682
I figured that with you on the board
you might have heard something.

14:07.849 --> 14:09.475
No.

14:09.642 --> 14:10.768
I didn't hear a thing.

14:13.062 --> 14:15.690
Well, they did do an audit,
but it didn't prove anything.

14:15.857 --> 14:17.525
Yeah.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.570
If somebody's stealing our money,
we gotta find out who.

14:20.737 --> 14:21.779
You tell this informant...

14:23.281 --> 14:25.742
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus Christ!

14:25.908 --> 14:26.951
Officer Bald.

14:28.786 --> 14:30.246
Are you blowing each other?

14:30.455 --> 14:32.290
About to, till you showed up.

14:32.457 --> 14:35.793
I know you're all partners,
but everyone's looking for you.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.795
Don't shine the light in here, officer.

14:37.962 --> 14:40.798
Can't a guy just hold his partner's hand?

14:40.965 --> 14:43.384
I'll let you girls be.

14:43.551 --> 14:48.306
- Wipe that stuff off your mouth, buddy.
- Yeah. Order me a drink, big guy.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.516
Jesus.

14:50.683 --> 14:53.644
- We'll finish this later.
- Yeah, all right.

14:56.898 --> 14:59.609
Yeah. Don't tell Linda.

15:01.194 --> 15:02.820
Shit.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.700
I don't like the thought
of fixing up this house alone, Danny.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.327
And with what you're doing...

15:09.494 --> 15:13.164
Nuh. Darling, that's the job.

15:14.582 --> 15:15.833
It's not the job.

15:17.210 --> 15:20.338
The job I can deal with.
It's how you do the job.

15:20.505 --> 15:22.840
- Like what you did today.
- I'm fine.

15:23.007 --> 15:24.425
This time.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.221
What I love about you is that you do
these crazy things.

15:28.387 --> 15:33.184
It's just that I wish you'd start
differentiating between crazy and stupid.

15:33.351 --> 15:35.728
I know this whole marriage thing
is new to you...

15:35.895 --> 15:39.524
but coming home every night
is a big part of it.

15:40.108 --> 15:41.192
Every night.

15:41.359 --> 15:43.486
Okay. I promise...

15:43.653 --> 15:46.697
I will come home every night.

15:50.201 --> 15:52.370
No matter what I have to do.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.039
Every night.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.128
What are you trying to negotiate? You
forget that I know you lie for a living.

16:00.294 --> 16:01.754
Not right now.

16:02.797 --> 16:04.257
Listen, listen.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.219
Danny Roman is a married man now.

16:08.469 --> 16:11.347
No more crazy shit, all right?

16:14.308 --> 16:15.518
See that?

16:15.685 --> 16:18.855
That's the bus.
The bus is going down the street.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.775
Crazy is on the bus.

16:29.448 --> 16:30.783
What's vibrating, baby?

16:34.328 --> 16:37.165
Nate is vibrating.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.878
Go. Tell Nate I said hello.

16:42.044 --> 16:46.674
And that I expect him to keep
you out of trouble from now on.

17:14.911 --> 17:17.121
Hey, how you doing? Caught me.

17:17.288 --> 17:19.874
Look, Danny beeped me earlier.
What's going on?

18:05.628 --> 18:07.296
Nate?

18:23.854 --> 18:25.523
Freeze!

18:25.773 --> 18:28.025
Get your hands up!

18:28.276 --> 18:30.861
Police officer! Officer down!

18:33.990 --> 18:36.117
He said he talked
to his informant last night.

18:36.284 --> 18:40.538
Some guy he was at academy with
and knew from Area 6.

18:41.455 --> 18:45.376
This guy said he knew what was
going down with the pension fund.

18:46.794 --> 18:50.423
The informant didn't come
to you guys...

18:53.801 --> 18:56.804
because he thought someone
from Internal Affairs was involved.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.224
One of us?

19:04.729 --> 19:07.106
Exactly who was this informant,
lieutenant?

19:07.273 --> 19:09.233
Hey, he didn't tell me his name.

19:10.568 --> 19:13.904
It's obvious somebody found out
Nate was investigating the fund...

19:14.071 --> 19:16.407
off this informant's tip
and they took him out.

19:17.241 --> 19:20.036
Let's go back to the beginning
and do this whole thing again.

19:20.202 --> 19:23.080
Hey, hey, hey. I just found my partner
with his head blown off.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.708
- I don't feel like doing this!
- You're gonna have to.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.001
- Fuck this!
- Back off.

19:27.335 --> 19:30.921
Back off, Niebaum.
We'll do it some other time, okay?

19:38.095 --> 19:40.556
Order!

21:02.805 --> 21:05.850
Order!

21:22.908 --> 21:26.787
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

21:29.540 --> 21:32.543
Ready. Aim. Fire.

21:36.005 --> 21:37.381
Aim. Fire.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.888
Aim. Fire.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.644
- Is that the door?
- You get it.

21:50.895 --> 21:52.104
Shit.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.074
Hey, Danny, listen, they found the gun
that killed Nathan.

22:04.241 --> 22:07.745
- It's in the lake. No fingerprints.
- Hang on. He's...

22:07.912 --> 22:09.747
- I have a search warrant...
- Just hold it.

22:09.914 --> 22:13.792
Danny, the serial number on the gun...
It was one of three stolen from a dealer.

22:13.959 --> 22:17.087
Two of the guns were recovered by you
around seven months ago.

22:17.254 --> 22:20.758
- The third gun was not found until now.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

22:20.925 --> 22:22.927
- You serious?
- Nothing we can do.

22:23.177 --> 22:26.347
We came as soon as we heard
they were issuing a warrant.

22:26.514 --> 22:29.558
- Guys, go easy. He's one of ours.
- In here. In here.

22:37.399 --> 22:41.028
I'm sorry about this, Karen.
We all know it's bullshit.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.280
Just let them do their work and get out.

22:43.447 --> 22:45.407
It is bullshit.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.452
He's standing over a dead cop
who was investigating the fund...

22:48.619 --> 22:51.288
he had access to the gun
and he's on the fund's board.

22:51.455 --> 22:54.750
- He had motive and opportunity.
- Who the fuck are you, Niebaum?

22:55.125 --> 22:58.295
It was your name Nate mentioned
when he said Internal Affairs was involved.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.297
Now it's my name?

23:00.881 --> 23:04.927
We've got an investigation too, and your
name keeps coming up. Wonder why.

23:05.469 --> 23:09.056
Maybe it's because Nathan found you
stealing money from the fund.

23:15.479 --> 23:16.647
Inspector!

23:17.481 --> 23:19.984
I think I got something in here.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.991
Looks like offshore accounts.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.123
What the...?

23:34.290 --> 23:37.126
That shit's not mine.
You planted this shit.

23:37.293 --> 23:38.752
Put it away.

23:39.712 --> 23:41.839
Why are you doing this to me?

23:42.089 --> 23:43.632
Chief, you don't...

23:52.975 --> 23:55.185
Lieutenant, do you think
you'll be charged...

23:55.352 --> 23:56.895
with the murder of Officer Roenick?

23:57.062 --> 23:59.773
Think you'll be charged
with the murder of Officer Roenick?

23:59.940 --> 24:02.943
Make a hole here.
Come on, come on, back up.

24:03.110 --> 24:05.738
- Hey! Give the guy a break!
- Get back. Get back.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.204
Beck.

24:15.039 --> 24:17.833
- Thanks.
- How can you show your face here?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.338
I knew someday
you'd get somebody killed.

24:22.504 --> 24:25.215
Nobody really knows
what happened, okay?

24:25.549 --> 24:27.343
Come on, seriously.

24:27.968 --> 24:31.347
What's going on, Danny?
We're hearing a lot of shit.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.391
What?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.769
Hey, Danny.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.729
Come on inside.

24:40.689 --> 24:43.192
All right, everybody, get back to work.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.242
Sit down, Danny.

24:56.205 --> 25:00.751
Danny, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I don't know what to think...

25:02.044 --> 25:03.712
but I don't have any choice...

25:03.879 --> 25:07.174
until this Internal Affairs
investigation is complete.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.429
So your gun and your badge.

25:15.265 --> 25:16.934
Chief.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.436
You know me.

25:21.230 --> 25:22.898
I'm being set up.

25:24.692 --> 25:27.069
Nate told me
his informant knows who's involved.

25:27.236 --> 25:30.280
Help me find this informant,
and all this goes away.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.284
Yeah.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.431
Lieutenant!

26:43.812 --> 26:46.398
- Have you talked to Mrs. Roenick?
- One more.

26:46.565 --> 26:48.525
Are you allowed to make any comment?

27:01.747 --> 27:04.291
- Linda. Linda.
- We should keep going.

27:04.458 --> 27:07.044
- No, Karen.
- Mrs. Roenick, we should go.

27:08.003 --> 27:11.632
Linda, I didn't do what
they say I did. I...

27:11.799 --> 27:15.177
- Mrs. Roenick, we should go.
- Fuck you, Danny.

27:16.220 --> 27:21.391
Fuck Niebaum. Fuck all of you.
You all killed him.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.895
Don't you stand here.
Don't you stand here in my face.

27:25.062 --> 27:27.147
Don't say one more fucking word to me.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.900
You took him away from me.

27:30.859 --> 27:34.029
God help you, Danny.
You took him away from Jeremy.

27:34.196 --> 27:38.951
Now you stand here...
You stand here and you just live with that.

27:39.201 --> 27:42.663
Mrs. Roenick. Please, let's go home.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.377
Danny, we need to go.

27:49.253 --> 27:51.421
We need to go.
Come on, this way.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.593
The papers found in your house:

27:57.261 --> 28:00.764
Can you come up with an explanation
as to why you had that kind of money?

28:00.931 --> 28:03.100
You have no proof the money
had to do with the fund...

28:03.267 --> 28:05.686
or that Mr. Roman
even opened those accounts.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.021
The money in them was well-laundered...

28:08.188 --> 28:11.692
but the last deposit matched
the last amount stolen from the fund.

28:11.859 --> 28:13.902
I don't have any offshore accounts.

28:14.069 --> 28:17.114
The statements were in your home.
You were standing over the body.

28:17.281 --> 28:20.450
Are you charging my client?
Because all of this is circumstantial.

28:21.410 --> 28:23.745
We have a gun linked to you...

28:24.037 --> 28:26.456
and a pair of gloves that we took
from the water.

28:27.791 --> 28:31.128
Which explains why your client
had no powder on his hands.

28:33.714 --> 28:36.508
You know how this city feels
about corrupt cops.

28:36.675 --> 28:39.136
I'll get a conviction
with my eyes closed.

28:39.636 --> 28:44.433
Just tell us where the rest of the money
went, who your partners were and maybe...

28:44.600 --> 28:46.977
- Maybe...
- I need to speak to my client.

28:49.980 --> 28:52.608
I'll give you one day to make a deal.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.652
You hear me? One day.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.238
After that, there'll be no deal
to negotiate.

28:58.405 --> 29:02.784
We will arrest you and you will
face the maximum penalty. I'll see to it.

29:06.496 --> 29:09.291
Be here tomorrow
and have a decision made.

29:15.839 --> 29:19.343
Danny. Danny.

29:37.611 --> 29:39.321
Danny.

29:39.488 --> 29:41.657
- Danny.
- What?

29:42.491 --> 29:47.079
Understand that they have a case
that a jury will convict on.

29:47.245 --> 29:48.997
I can't do any more for you.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.541
Cut a deal.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.012
Karen.

30:06.056 --> 30:09.351
Go and wait for me in the car.
Don't worry.

30:09.518 --> 30:11.561
Everything's gonna be fine.

30:11.728 --> 30:14.982
- Danny, please don't do anything crazy.
- Crazy?

30:15.649 --> 30:17.567
Crazy's on the bus, remember?

30:20.821 --> 30:22.239
I love you.

30:36.712 --> 30:38.672
I love you too.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.340
Be right back.

31:16.126 --> 31:18.295
- Danny Roman.
- I'm going to see Niebaum.

31:18.462 --> 31:21.465
Sir, could you wait
just a minute? I have to buzz him, sir.

31:21.631 --> 31:24.051
Mr. Roman, wait, sir!

31:26.136 --> 31:28.096
You made it clear...
Make it clear again.

31:28.263 --> 31:29.473
Come on. This is...

31:33.477 --> 31:37.147
Hold on. Hold on.
Roman. What can I do for you?

31:37.731 --> 31:40.942
Man's got a right to face his accusers,
doesn't he, inspector?

31:41.109 --> 31:43.320
- We need to talk.
- Go ahead, talk.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.822
I wanna know what's going on.

31:49.242 --> 31:53.163
You killed your partner and you're about
to be formally indicted for it.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.665
You're not answering my question.

31:55.832 --> 31:58.126
Nate told me you were involved.
I wanna know how.

32:01.213 --> 32:03.632
Look me in the eye
and tell me you weren't involved.

32:03.799 --> 32:06.176
- Look me in the eye!
- Look you in the eye for what?

32:06.343 --> 32:08.637
Lookit, why don't you tell it
to the judge?

32:08.804 --> 32:11.264
All right? We're finished.
Get him out of here.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.600
- You're not doing this!
- Look, you. Go!

32:16.353 --> 32:17.646
Roman.

32:20.649 --> 32:22.109
No!

32:26.113 --> 32:27.447
Fuck.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.617
Lock the door. Lock it!

32:31.660 --> 32:34.037
Don't make things
worse than they already are.

32:34.204 --> 32:36.873
- Just put the gun down now.
- You, sit your ass down.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.126
- Sit!
- Okay, man, you got it.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.379
This is my life here, Niebaum.

32:44.214 --> 32:46.466
- I want some answers.
- I don't have any answers.

32:46.633 --> 32:48.135
Put the gun down and leave.

32:48.301 --> 32:52.055
You don't feel like talking?
We're gonna stay here until you do.

32:52.556 --> 32:54.141
It's your choice...

32:54.891 --> 32:58.061
because I'm not going to jail today.

33:02.232 --> 33:04.067
Move!

33:06.653 --> 33:07.696
Go! GO!

33:07.863 --> 33:10.115
- All right.
- Come on!

33:11.491 --> 33:12.742
Drop your weapon.

33:12.909 --> 33:15.245
- Drop it, Danny.
- Guns down.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.039
- Drop the weapon.
- Drop it.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.587
That wasn't an accident. And neither
will the next one that goes in your head.

33:23.753 --> 33:26.506
Now get down here, now. Come on!

33:27.215 --> 33:30.260
All right, everybody in here march over
to that desk over there.

33:30.427 --> 33:33.430
Put your guns, cuffs,
keys, everything...

33:33.597 --> 33:37.100
on this desk and get out of here.
Let's go. Move! Move it!

33:38.143 --> 33:39.769
- Take it easy.
- Danny.

33:39.936 --> 33:42.772
- What are you doing here?
- The call's out on the city-wide.

33:42.939 --> 33:46.109
- See what they're making me do?
- Danny, you just got married, man.

33:46.276 --> 33:47.777
Think about Karen.

33:49.446 --> 33:51.448
I am thinking about Karen.

33:52.741 --> 33:55.243
And now that I think about it,
I'm glad you're here.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.412
You just raised the ante.

33:58.371 --> 34:01.124
- Join the party.
- God, Danny, this is crazy.

34:01.291 --> 34:04.461
Take your guns off.
Put them on this table now!

34:08.797 --> 34:11.592
I know you heard me say
both of them.

34:53.051 --> 34:56.012
Danny, listen to me.
It's not too late to stop this.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.139
You trying to talk me down? That it?

34:58.306 --> 35:01.017
Danny, this is crazy.
This isn't helping you.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.729
- Me and him have nothing to do with this.
- Right.

35:04.896 --> 35:06.982
I've known you 20 years.
What are you doing?

35:07.148 --> 35:10.986
I know I made you stay, Frost, but you
cannot monopolize the conversation.

35:11.152 --> 35:15.198
You're not the scene commander here.
I am. You.

35:15.782 --> 35:18.994
You're Niebaum's secretary, right?
What's your name?

35:19.160 --> 35:21.371
My name's Maggie, and I'm his assistant.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.873
Maggie, don't be scared.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.751
I'm somewhat familiar
with situations like this, all right?

35:26.918 --> 35:29.879
I'm not scared. I've been mugged twice,
once at gunpoint.

35:30.046 --> 35:32.048
Guns are not new to me...

35:32.215 --> 35:34.551
but I'd rather avoid them
if I get the chance.

35:34.968 --> 35:38.096
Well, I don't think you're gonna
have that chance this time, Maggie.

35:38.263 --> 35:42.517
And if you're Niebaum's assistant,
you have everything to do with this.

35:43.059 --> 35:47.147
But not me, bro. Okay?
I don't work for this pig.

35:47.314 --> 35:49.107
- I'm not a cop.
- You're Rudy Timmons.

35:49.274 --> 35:52.902
You're a rat for the rat squad.
You don't remember me?

35:53.403 --> 35:56.031
I arrested you in '92
for credit-card fraud.

35:56.197 --> 36:00.076
Oh, shit. Yeah, wow.
Yeah, I remember you.

36:00.243 --> 36:02.245
I remember you. Hey, man!

36:02.412 --> 36:05.248
Last time I saw you,
you were a clean-cut boy in blue.

36:05.415 --> 36:09.377
- What happened to you, man?
- That's what we're here to find out, Rudy.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.930
Air 1, realize the location.

36:22.265 --> 36:24.267
I wonder if they're out there.

36:25.101 --> 36:26.936
Your partners, Niebaum.

36:28.355 --> 36:30.023
The guilty ones.

36:30.607 --> 36:31.608
MY guys.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.778
They'll come, you know.

36:34.944 --> 36:38.281
Scared shitless I'll get the truth
out of you and try and stop them.

36:38.448 --> 36:41.284
And if they can't get me,
they'll kill you.

36:58.843 --> 37:01.805
Goddamn it. Have them clear the perimeter
and start evac.

37:05.725 --> 37:08.645
I don't want anything moving
on that fucking river!

37:12.774 --> 37:15.485
Locate the phone panel.
Lock down the elevator.

37:15.652 --> 37:19.489
Have these guys clear the stairwell.
Have Unit <i>2</i> hold outside Internal Affairs.

37:19.656 --> 37:21.074
You got it. Come on.

37:21.241 --> 37:23.660
- Chief?
- Christ, they're here already.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.914
Set up command on that barge over there
so the press can't get to us.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.224
What do you got?

38:28.391 --> 38:30.894
We locked down the elevators
from the 20th floor down.

38:32.228 --> 38:34.397
- Beck.
- Let's get the phones hooked up.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.566
I got a real concern.

38:36.733 --> 38:39.736
He knows our tactics and we got
a lot of real estate to lock down.

38:39.903 --> 38:41.196
Do we have the manpower?

38:41.404 --> 38:44.199
We got personnel from
six different districts...

38:44.491 --> 38:47.577
but he's still gonna try and control
the environment.

38:49.579 --> 38:51.206
We'll just see who wins the race.

39:26.074 --> 39:28.409
Perpetrator is an expert marksman.

39:28.660 --> 39:31.496
He's an expert in explosives and tactics.

39:31.663 --> 39:35.041
<i>Gentlemen, play this by the numbers.</i>

39:35.208 --> 39:37.418
<i>Maintain your fields of fire.</i>

39:46.427 --> 39:48.263
Elevators.

40:01.985 --> 40:04.153
Fucking Roman's up there, man.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.197
He's got Frost inside.

40:06.656 --> 40:09.242
See a chance to end this,
we take him out.

40:15.915 --> 40:17.834
We're blind and he's seeing 20-20.

40:18.167 --> 40:19.502
- Intel?
- Yeah.

40:19.669 --> 40:22.088
I want visuals and audio
set up from 19 and 21.

40:22.255 --> 40:24.173
- Yes, sir.
- Farley, you're negotiating.

40:24.340 --> 40:26.426
- He'll eat Farley up.
- Commander...

40:27.677 --> 40:31.598
- if you wanna talk to him...
- You can't handle it, I won't have a choice.

40:31.764 --> 40:36.436
Get him locked down first. In the meantime,
Farley, get on the fucking phone.

40:38.438 --> 40:41.608
- Someone locate the building engineer.
- Right away.

40:42.358 --> 40:44.360
Oh, boy.

40:59.834 --> 41:01.544
Chief Travis.

41:04.297 --> 41:07.216
Special Agents Grey,
this is Moran.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.719
We're the FBI negotiators.

41:10.803 --> 41:13.723
It's a federal building.
It's our jurisdiction.

41:13.890 --> 41:16.059
He's one of ours. We got this.

41:16.225 --> 41:18.144
Fine with us. For now.

41:24.275 --> 41:26.694
Chief. We got eyes.

41:42.669 --> 41:45.922
Son of a bitch. Go to Camera 2.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.110
He got all six. We got nothing.

42:08.778 --> 42:11.531
We gotta see in that room.

42:13.825 --> 42:17.578
No eyes, no ears.
Looks like we're running out of options.

42:17.745 --> 42:20.707
- I want status reports now.
- Give me an update.

42:23.126 --> 42:24.502
<i>Give</i> me status.

42:24.669 --> 42:26.629
<i>Somebody give me status.
Tell me what you see.</i>

42:26.796 --> 42:28.715
All shafts are locked down, sir.

42:29.215 --> 42:30.967
Blinds closed.

42:31.843 --> 42:33.344
Visibility's zero, sir.

42:33.803 --> 42:34.971
We contained him.

42:35.138 --> 42:37.724
We have not contained him.
He's contained himself.

42:37.974 --> 42:39.142
He's cut us off.

42:39.308 --> 42:41.853
Try the phone again. See what he wants.

42:48.317 --> 42:49.485
Talk.

42:50.319 --> 42:51.988
Hello?

42:55.241 --> 42:56.826
Yeah. Hello?

42:56.993 --> 43:00.621
I'm Rudy, so don't shoot me
thinking I'm him. Please.

43:02.790 --> 43:04.667
Rudy, my name is Farley.

43:05.793 --> 43:09.964
- Could you please get Danny on the line?
- Farley would like to talk to you.

43:10.131 --> 43:12.341
Tell him I only wanna talk
to Chris Sabian.

43:14.927 --> 43:17.096
He'll only talk to Chris Sabian.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.850
Tell him if Sabian's not
here in 20 minutes, you die.

43:22.310 --> 43:26.189
I don't wanna talk to anyone else
but Chris Sabian.

43:26.898 --> 43:28.024
Okay.

43:28.191 --> 43:29.525
We heard you.

43:31.110 --> 43:32.862
He said they heard you.

43:43.206 --> 43:44.499
Who's Chris Sabian?

43:45.333 --> 43:47.710
- I heard that name before.
- He's from the west side.

43:47.877 --> 43:51.380
Once he talked 55 hours.
Never forces tactical action.

43:52.173 --> 43:54.050
I don't know how Danny knows him.

43:57.512 --> 44:00.348
- So find Sabian.
- 911 Chris Sabian.

44:05.978 --> 44:07.230
Come on.

44:07.730 --> 44:09.065
Talk to me.

44:10.566 --> 44:11.734
I'm right here.

44:12.026 --> 44:16.072
I'm not going anywhere,
so please come out.

44:16.864 --> 44:19.242
You don't want me to come out.
I wanna kill her.

44:19.492 --> 44:21.452
I do want you to come out.
Come out...

44:21.619 --> 44:23.329
so we can discuss this.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.581
You're not even listening to me.

44:26.249 --> 44:28.376
Yes, I am listening to you.

44:28.543 --> 44:33.130
I just... You promised that you'd come out,
so come on out, all right?

44:33.297 --> 44:35.591
I don't wanna do this through the door.

44:39.345 --> 44:42.348
Look, I just wanna do something
without arguing, okay?

44:42.515 --> 44:43.558
Let's get on the road.

44:43.724 --> 44:46.018
- Your clothes look fine.
- No.

44:46.435 --> 44:48.688
- They do.
- According to some people...

44:48.855 --> 44:50.857
I look fat in ski clothes.

44:51.023 --> 44:54.777
That's not the word she used.
She used...

44:57.113 --> 44:58.781
a much worse word.

45:01.117 --> 45:03.202
Honey, get off the phone!

45:03.744 --> 45:04.996
- Get off the phone.
- I know.

45:05.913 --> 45:07.290
- Get off the phone.
- No.

45:07.456 --> 45:10.251
I'm your father
and I'm very upset with you right now.

45:11.419 --> 45:12.962
Try your sweater.

45:13.129 --> 45:15.089
Honey, but get off the phone.

45:15.256 --> 45:16.966
I want you to apologize...

45:17.133 --> 45:19.218
to your mother for saying she looks...

45:19.594 --> 45:20.803
"Wide."

45:22.930 --> 45:25.057
That's not a good word to use, wide.

45:25.224 --> 45:26.642
How'd you like to be called wide?

45:26.809 --> 45:28.644
You hear me? I'm very serious.

45:28.811 --> 45:29.854
I'm very angry with you!

45:30.021 --> 45:33.316
Right now. Get off the phone.
Get off the phone.

45:33.649 --> 45:34.729
- No.
- Don't you make me...

45:37.278 --> 45:39.697
I talked a man out of
blowing up the Sears Tower...

45:39.864 --> 45:42.950
but I can't talk my wife out
of a bedroom or my kid off a phone.

45:43.117 --> 45:47.163
That's because no one's standing
behind you with a big gun.

45:47.830 --> 45:49.498
Yeah, well, that's debatable.

45:50.833 --> 45:52.251
Hold on.

45:53.127 --> 45:54.587
Hello?

45:54.754 --> 45:56.130
Yeah. He's right here.

45:56.756 --> 45:57.840
It's for you.

45:58.841 --> 46:00.593
Hello?

46:05.556 --> 46:07.183
Sabian's 20 minutes out.

46:08.142 --> 46:09.560
And we only got 15.

46:09.727 --> 46:12.021
All right, call Danny
and change that deadline.

46:13.022 --> 46:14.857
Tell him Sabian's on his way.

46:24.158 --> 46:25.701
Sabian?

46:26.661 --> 46:28.871
No, it's Farley.

46:29.038 --> 46:32.458
Look, Farley, I told you, I don't wanna
talk to anyone but Chris Sabian.

46:32.625 --> 46:34.877
Yeah, he's on his way, okay?

46:35.044 --> 46:37.713
He's gonna be here real soon.
We just need more time.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.632
You don't have more time, Farley.

46:39.799 --> 46:41.217
<i>Danny, please, tell me.</i>

46:41.384 --> 46:43.970
What are you doing here, okay?
This is pretty serious.

46:44.136 --> 46:46.889
You're goddamn right!
So why don't you take me seriously?

46:47.056 --> 46:49.392
Well, we are. We are. We just...

46:50.685 --> 46:53.396
- It just... I just want to talk to you.
<i>- Wait, wait.</i>

46:53.562 --> 46:56.565
Wait, wait.
You think you can talk me down, Farley?

46:56.732 --> 47:00.194
Look, I need to...

47:01.070 --> 47:03.406
Tell me what you want, all right?

47:04.073 --> 47:05.491
Okay, Farley.

47:05.658 --> 47:08.619
You want a shot'? I'll give you a shot.

47:08.786 --> 47:11.872
Yeah. We got some time
before Sabian gets here.

47:12.039 --> 47:16.544
What do I want? Let's see.
How about... Can I see a priest?

47:17.878 --> 47:19.338
No, you can't see a priest.

47:19.505 --> 47:22.591
<i>That's good, Farley. Good.
You shouldn't let</i> me <i>see</i> a <i>priest.</i>

47:22.758 --> 47:26.721
A priest is associated with death, and you
don't want me thinking about death.

47:27.263 --> 47:29.056
No, no.

47:29.223 --> 47:31.642
But you told me "no."
You can't say "no."

47:31.892 --> 47:34.562
Never use "no" in a hostage situation.

47:34.729 --> 47:37.356
<i>- Would you</i> relax?
<i>- I 'm very fucking relaxed!</i>

47:37.523 --> 47:39.066
<i>But let me give you some advice:</i>

47:39.233 --> 47:42.737
Never say "no" to a hostage-taker.
It's in the manual.

47:42.903 --> 47:45.948
- Now, are you gonna tell me "no" again?
- No, I'm not.

47:46.115 --> 47:50.119
<i>Wrong answer! Eliminate "no"
from your vocabulary.</i>

47:50.286 --> 47:53.414
<i>Never use "no," "don't,"
"won't" or "can't," all right?</i>

47:53.581 --> 47:56.167
It eliminates options.
The only option that leaves...

47:56.333 --> 47:58.210
is to shoot someone. Understand?

47:58.377 --> 48:01.964
<i>- Yes. Yes,</i> I <i>do.</i>
<i>- Yes! Good! See, "yes" is good.</i>

48:02.131 --> 48:05.676
Say "no" again, I'll kill somebody,
all right? Now, let's practice.

48:05.843 --> 48:06.927
Can I see a priest?

48:07.470 --> 48:10.598
Let's not... You know what?
Can we just talk...

48:10.765 --> 48:14.268
You wanted to talk. We are talking.
Now, can I see a priest?

48:15.061 --> 48:16.645
I'll see what I can do.

48:17.313 --> 48:19.815
<i>That's good, Farley. Now you're learning.</i>

48:20.483 --> 48:23.819
I'd like a submachine gun,
so I can blow everyone away.

48:23.986 --> 48:26.822
<i>- I'll look into that.
- Good. You're doing good, Farley.</i>

48:27.573 --> 48:28.908
You ever cheat on your wife?

48:30.284 --> 48:32.828
- No.
- Watch yourself. I'll kill someone.

48:32.995 --> 48:36.123
You ever cheat on your wife? Answer!

48:36.499 --> 48:38.000
I'll see what I can do.

48:39.627 --> 48:42.296
<i>I'll have to think about that.
I'll look into that.</i>

48:42.463 --> 48:44.173
You ever...

48:44.423 --> 48:47.176
dress up like a schoolgirl
and get you ass spanked?

48:47.927 --> 48:51.138
Danny, look, okay, all right,
all I wanna do is talk to you.

48:51.305 --> 48:53.516
I am talking! Now, did you
or did you not...

48:53.682 --> 48:56.769
ever dress up like a schoolgirl
and get your ass spanked?

48:57.978 --> 49:00.106
- Have to look into that, Danny.
- Jesus, Farley.

49:00.272 --> 49:05.861
Nothing against you dressing up like a girl,
but I didn't know that about you, Farley.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.698
- Danny, this is really unproductive.
- Unproductive?

49:10.241 --> 49:11.617
<i>You're right. It is.</i>

49:11.784 --> 49:15.496
<i>So tell me a joke, Farley.
You know any jokes?</i>

49:15.663 --> 49:16.789
- No.
- No?

49:16.956 --> 49:19.542
You just cost someone their life, Farley!
Game over!

49:21.168 --> 49:22.461
Shot <i>fired.</i>

49:25.381 --> 49:27.383
Shot fired. Shot fired. Can anyone see?

49:32.972 --> 49:34.723
Don't let him go.

49:36.976 --> 49:41.230
You can't talk me down!
You can't make me change the deadline!

49:41.397 --> 49:43.440
Now get me Sabian!

49:43.607 --> 49:47.570
You got six minutes, 42, 41

49:47.736 --> 49:50.406
- <i>Forty!
- Listen, Danny, is anybody hurt?</i>

49:50.573 --> 49:51.574
Is anybody hurt?

49:51.824 --> 49:55.035
We're okay. Just don't be saying
"no" no more, motherfucker!

49:56.704 --> 49:57.746
Oh, fuck.

49:57.913 --> 50:00.583
- Everybody calm down.
- I'm so sorry. No, I'm so sorry.

50:00.749 --> 50:02.418
I'm so fucking sorry.

50:03.002 --> 50:04.336
<i>Give</i> me status.

50:04.503 --> 50:07.089
<i>Somebody give me status.
Tell me what you see.</i>

50:07.423 --> 50:09.008
Visibility zero, sir.

50:13.179 --> 50:14.555
<i>Just a few moments ago...</i>

50:14.722 --> 50:18.475
<i>a single shot was fired
inside the city administration building.</i>

50:18.642 --> 50:20.728
<i>We, of course,
could not hear it down here...</i>

50:20.895 --> 50:23.939
We got the whole city
of Chicago watching this.

50:24.815 --> 50:27.610
This could turn into a press nightmare.

50:30.112 --> 50:32.865
What do we do if Sabian can't make it?

50:34.325 --> 50:36.785
We gotta remember
that that's Danny Roman upstairs.

50:36.952 --> 50:40.456
We've worked with the guy for 12 years
and don't really know what he's done.

50:40.623 --> 50:42.666
We know what he's doing now.

50:45.544 --> 50:48.464
I don't want this to get personal for us.

50:49.465 --> 50:52.384
He's obviously over...
Hey, do you mind?

50:59.642 --> 51:01.602
He's obviously gone over the edge.

51:01.769 --> 51:03.145
This is not personal.

51:04.063 --> 51:08.484
If I thought sending these guys, my team in
would put more people in jeopardy...

51:08.734 --> 51:10.611
I wouldn't consider it.

51:12.988 --> 51:16.200
I don't wanna go in there,
but it's our best option.

51:16.367 --> 51:17.993
He can't be talked down.

51:18.953 --> 51:22.039
They'll get us out.
Don't worry about Danny.

51:22.206 --> 51:24.041
- He's not gonna hurt anybody.
- Bullshit.

51:24.208 --> 51:27.169
No one knows what this
crazy fucker is gonna do.

51:27.336 --> 51:29.505
This has nothing to do with me
and Maggie.

51:29.672 --> 51:32.174
You know, you're his friend.
You get him to let us go.

51:32.508 --> 51:35.678
Because once you familiarize yourself
with the chains of bondage...

51:36.136 --> 51:38.722
you prepare your own limbs
to wear them.

51:38.889 --> 51:41.225
Fucking Abraham Lincoln said that
and I believe it.

51:41.433 --> 51:44.687
So you have gotta get me
the fuck out! Now!

51:46.647 --> 51:49.358
Do yourself a favor and keep quiet.
We'll handle this.

51:49.525 --> 51:53.153
Don't tell me to be quiet and don't
tell me you can fucking handle it...

51:53.320 --> 51:56.323
because none of you ever been
in a situation like this before.

51:56.490 --> 51:59.702
- Just shut the fuck up.
- Fuck you!

51:59.994 --> 52:01.996
- Prick.
- All right, that's enough.

52:02.162 --> 52:05.499
He's gonna hear you out there,
and he's got the gun, so he's in charge.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.043
Both of you need to pipe down.

52:12.339 --> 52:16.385
Danny. I think you should let Maggie go.
She's not involved.

52:16.552 --> 52:18.220
She's a woman,
and it's only fair...

52:18.387 --> 52:21.724
I didn't ask to be let go because
I'm a woman. I hate that crap.

52:22.975 --> 52:26.186
Me and him should be let go
because we had nothing to do with this.

52:26.353 --> 52:29.106
- It's between you cops.
- We have nothing to do with this.

52:29.273 --> 52:33.152
Danny, Danny, look,
I'm not some just dirt merchant...

52:33.319 --> 52:34.945
loose in the street anymore.

52:35.112 --> 52:38.574
I'm not. I got a nice new lady friend
that I would like to get back to.

52:38.741 --> 52:42.661
And she has got this kid, Albert.
Super kid, Dan.

52:43.037 --> 52:46.123
- Great kid.
- Dan, what do you think you can do?

52:46.290 --> 52:48.000
Take a look at that screen.

52:48.542 --> 52:53.047
They think you're a killer, Danny.
They're gonna try to take you out.

52:53.213 --> 52:56.425
What do you think Sabian can do?
He can't do anything to stop this.

52:56.592 --> 52:58.427
What about you, Frosty?

52:58.594 --> 53:00.971
You think I'm a killer too?

53:01.138 --> 53:02.306
Come on.

53:02.473 --> 53:05.517
You've known me for 20 years.

53:07.227 --> 53:08.437
You think I killed Nate?

53:14.026 --> 53:16.070
I don't know what to think, Danny.

53:17.446 --> 53:18.864
I'll tell you this, Danny boy:

53:20.032 --> 53:21.909
What you're doing is not helping.

53:40.135 --> 53:41.887
Hey, schoolgirl.

53:43.597 --> 53:47.142
<i>You still sweating that ugly display
you gave us all a few minutes ago?</i>

53:47.893 --> 53:51.897
Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
We all have our bad days. Beck.

53:52.314 --> 53:55.275
<i>Stop trying to figure out
how to get in here. I'm well bunkered.</i>

53:55.442 --> 53:58.612
Palermo, take that toothpick out
of your mouth.

53:59.071 --> 54:01.907
<i>Wouldn't want you to swallow it
if something goes down.</i>

54:02.074 --> 54:04.159
That's right, sports fans...

54:04.410 --> 54:06.245
it's me, Danny Roman.

54:06.495 --> 54:08.414
The man upstairs.

54:08.831 --> 54:12.501
Just wanted to say hello before the curtain
goes up on this little drama.

54:14.628 --> 54:16.797
<i>I guess you're all wondering
why we're here.</i>

54:17.339 --> 54:18.841
Well, it's simple.

54:19.258 --> 54:22.428
We're here to find out
who took our money...

54:22.594 --> 54:26.014
and who killed Nate,
because it wasn't me.

54:26.598 --> 54:28.809
There's some bad cops among us...

54:28.976 --> 54:32.604
<i>and today we're gonna find out
who they are.</i>

54:33.772 --> 54:35.190
<i>Now, I know how that sounds.</i>

54:35.774 --> 54:37.192
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

54:37.484 --> 54:40.112
<i>"He's gone. He's a murderer."</i>

54:41.196 --> 54:44.366
But I'm that same son of a bitch
you trusted your lives with...

54:44.533 --> 54:47.327
played softball with,
went drinking with.

54:47.578 --> 54:52.332
I'm the same guy you invited to your house
to celebrate your kid's baptism, Tonray.

54:52.624 --> 54:54.460
<i>The same guy who saved Palermo's ass...</i>

54:54.626 --> 54:57.629
<i>when that sniper had a bead
on him at the stadium gig.</i>

54:58.046 --> 55:00.090
This is good?

55:00.257 --> 55:03.844
Danny's trying to get us to Stockholm
so we think twice about taking him out.

55:05.304 --> 55:06.680
Now, I want...

55:06.847 --> 55:09.391
No, I need you guys...

55:09.558 --> 55:12.227
<i>to understand
that I had no choice here.</i>

55:13.353 --> 55:16.231
My life was being stripped away from me.

55:17.107 --> 55:18.734
First, they kill Nate.

55:22.905 --> 55:24.740
Then they took my badge.

55:25.699 --> 55:26.742
Then you guys.

55:27.784 --> 55:28.827
<i>Next...</i>

55:29.620 --> 55:33.290
they were gonna take away my wife
by sending me to prison.

55:33.457 --> 55:35.334
And that...

55:35.501 --> 55:37.669
I cannot take.

55:38.670 --> 55:41.006
I can't live without...

55:47.262 --> 55:49.181
Put yourself in my position.

55:50.766 --> 55:52.100
<i>What else could I do?</i>

55:52.851 --> 55:55.729
Get word out to our team.
We're switching to frequency three.

55:55.896 --> 55:57.105
- Yes, sir.
- Run.

55:58.148 --> 56:02.027
I tried to tell everyone I was being
set up, but no one wanted to listen.

56:02.736 --> 56:04.696
<i>Well, now you have no choice.</i>

56:04.863 --> 56:07.449
You got to listen,
because we're not leaving here...

56:07.616 --> 56:10.160
until I find out who set me up.

56:12.120 --> 56:13.622
Let me warn you:

56:13.789 --> 56:17.584
Whoever killed Nate is frightened
that Niebaum might know something.

56:18.210 --> 56:20.671
They're going to try and end this quickly.

56:21.255 --> 56:22.714
Another warning:

56:23.131 --> 56:27.886
I know the rules of engagement,
so don't test me.

56:28.470 --> 56:32.933
You got four minutes
to get Sabian here...

56:33.100 --> 56:36.770
or you'll find out
just how serious I really am.

56:52.744 --> 56:55.080
I want you to look me
in the eye, Niebaum.

56:55.664 --> 56:56.999
Right here.

56:58.500 --> 56:59.585
Now, tell me...

57:00.919 --> 57:04.506
when did you find out Nate
was investigating the fund?

57:14.141 --> 57:17.352
I first found that Nathan
was conducting the investigation...

57:17.519 --> 57:19.646
after I spoke with you
after he was killed.

57:20.856 --> 57:23.817
You're lying.
And I know you're lying.

57:23.984 --> 57:26.987
You know it?
You can read my mind, Roman, is that it?

57:27.154 --> 57:29.865
No, I'm not. I'm reading your eyes.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.700
The eyes can't lie.

57:33.035 --> 57:34.661
Didn't you know what I was doing?

57:35.787 --> 57:39.708
A quick lesson in lying.
See, this is what us real cops do.

57:39.875 --> 57:41.501
We study liars.

57:41.668 --> 57:42.711
Example:

57:42.878 --> 57:46.506
If I ask you a question about something
visual, like your favorite color...

57:46.840 --> 57:49.384
and your eyes go up and to the left...

57:49.551 --> 57:52.888
neurophysiology tells us
that your eyes go that in that direction...

57:53.055 --> 57:55.140
because you're accessing
the visual cortex.

57:55.307 --> 57:57.601
Therefore, you're telling the truth.

57:57.768 --> 58:00.312
If your eyes go up and right...

58:00.479 --> 58:02.731
you access the creative centers
of the brain...

58:02.898 --> 58:04.775
and we know you're full of shit.

58:04.941 --> 58:07.069
Now, let's try this again.

58:07.486 --> 58:09.863
What's your favorite television show?

58:10.030 --> 58:12.866
I'm not gonna play
your stupid fucking game, okay, Roman?

58:13.033 --> 58:15.827
Why, Niebaum?
You afraid we'll catch you in a lie?

58:19.373 --> 58:22.376
When did you find out
Nate was investigating the fund?

58:22.626 --> 58:26.672
- After I spoke with you.
- That is a fucking lie if I've ever seen one!

58:26.838 --> 58:30.884
- Fuck you! I never blinked my eyes!
- You didn't have to blink.

58:31.051 --> 58:32.886
Your body language says you're lying.

58:33.053 --> 58:35.430
He's nervous, Danny.
What do you expect?

58:35.597 --> 58:38.016
Shut up, Frost!
You know how this works!

58:38.183 --> 58:40.686
It's not just your eyes, Niebaum.
It's everything.

58:40.852 --> 58:44.231
If you cough, sneeze, cross your legs,
scratch your ass...

58:44.398 --> 58:46.566
they're all telltale signs.
You can't cheat.

58:46.733 --> 58:49.986
You can stare at me with those
dead-ass eyes of yours all you want.

58:50.153 --> 58:52.114
You can't beat the system.

58:52.364 --> 58:53.448
One last question:

58:57.536 --> 58:59.121
Do you know who killed Nate?

59:07.212 --> 59:08.255
You.

59:11.133 --> 59:14.094
I don't know. I couldn't tell.
Up, down, right, left...

59:15.887 --> 59:17.222
So, what now? Card tricks?

59:17.889 --> 59:19.474
Shut the fuck up, Niebaum!

59:19.641 --> 59:22.728
You knew Nate was investigating
the fund and you killed him.

59:23.895 --> 59:27.357
You could've ended this,
but I guess you don't want to.

59:27.649 --> 59:28.984
That's too bad.

59:30.068 --> 59:34.156
That's really too bad, Rudy...

59:34.322 --> 59:37.743
because Danny Roman
was just starting to like you.

59:37.909 --> 59:40.120
Well, tell Danny Roman
to hold the fuck on.

59:41.538 --> 59:42.956
Danny.

59:43.123 --> 59:45.500
- Danny, you don't wanna do this.
- How do you know?

59:46.001 --> 59:50.172
If you think I could kill Nate, how the
fuck do you know I don't wanna do this?

01:00:01.183 --> 01:00:03.477
- Yeah?
- Danny Roman?

01:00:03.894 --> 01:00:05.353
This is Chris Sabian here.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.191
Good timing, Chris.
You made it just in time.

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:13.695
<i>- Well,</i> I <i>got</i> lucky. <i>Traffic was light.</i>
<i>- Glad you accepted my invitation.</i>

01:00:13.862 --> 01:00:17.449
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
What's it been, Danny? Two years?

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:20.869
Not since both our teams
showed up for that gig on the north side.

01:00:21.036 --> 01:00:23.205
You pulled rank and ran my boys
out of there.

01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:27.000
Two negotiators on the same site
never work.

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:30.796
So, what's this, then?
The exception that disproves the rule?

01:00:30.962 --> 01:00:34.925
Look, you do your job, I do mine...

01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:37.010
maybe we both walk out in one piece.

01:00:40.889 --> 01:00:44.476
- Here's the million-dollar question.
- Why you?

01:00:45.143 --> 01:00:46.269
Exactly.

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:48.897
I got my reasons.
I don't wanna go into them now.

01:00:49.064 --> 01:00:51.191
We'll talk about that later.

01:00:51.358 --> 01:00:54.236
This is our first date, Chris.
The courting period.

01:00:55.737 --> 01:01:01.159
So, what do guys like you do
when you're not talking guys like me down?

01:01:01.326 --> 01:01:07.374
Well, I... I'm a homebody, Danny.
I spend a lot of time with my family.

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:09.876
My kid.

01:01:10.502 --> 01:01:12.754
I read a lot of books.

01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:15.924
<i>I watch a lot of old movies. AMC.</i>

01:01:16.091 --> 01:01:18.885
You got a satellite?
They show all those old Westerns.

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:21.096
Westerns?

01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:22.597
I like comedies, myself.

01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:25.392
<i>I did like Shane though.
That's a good one.</i>

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:27.727
Shane. Now, that's a good one...

01:01:28.186 --> 01:01:31.898
but I'd have picked one
where the hero lives at the end, you know?

01:01:32.065 --> 01:01:35.902
<i>Like Rio Bravo or Red River.</i>

01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:38.280
<i>You're talking
about the wrong movie.</i>

01:01:38.446 --> 01:01:42.659
Shane lives. At the end of it,
he's riding off and that kid, Brandon...

01:01:42.826 --> 01:01:43.869
De Wilde.

01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:47.455
Brandon's De Wilde's calling his name:
"Shane, come back! Shane!"

01:01:48.456 --> 01:01:51.543
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Shane died.

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:54.170
You never see Shane dead.
That's an assumption.

01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:56.131
It's a common mistake.

01:01:56.298 --> 01:01:59.301
You see, in the final shot,
you see him slumped over his horse.

01:01:59.551 --> 01:02:02.137
He doesn't look back,
because he's can't. Shane's dead.

01:02:02.554 --> 01:02:05.140
<i>He's slumped because he's shot.
Slumped don't mean dead.</i>

01:02:05.307 --> 01:02:07.726
I guess you think that Butch
and Sundance live too...

01:02:07.893 --> 01:02:10.937
even though you never see them dead,
and they're surrounded.

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:12.814
So you're some kind of history buff?

01:02:13.148 --> 01:02:15.442
Yeah, I generally read histories
and biographies.

01:02:15.609 --> 01:02:17.485
Well, don't believe everything you read.

01:02:18.028 --> 01:02:19.988
Well, I didn't say I read just one book.

01:02:20.155 --> 01:02:23.825
I try to read all the books on a subject.
You know, try to get all the facts...

01:02:23.992 --> 01:02:26.661
and then decide for myself
what really happened.

01:02:26.995 --> 01:02:30.498
Get all the facts.
Yeah, that's smart.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:32.834
You're much better at this than Farley.

01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:36.129
<i>Before we start to bore everyone,
let's get back to business.</i>

01:02:36.463 --> 01:02:38.423
<i>First, my list of demands.</i>

01:02:41.176 --> 01:02:44.179
One: I want my badge
brought down here.

01:02:44.346 --> 01:02:46.681
Two: If I die,
I want a departmental funeral.

01:02:46.973 --> 01:02:48.266
No one's gonna die here.

01:02:48.433 --> 01:02:50.352
<i>Three: I want the informant found.</i>

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:52.270
He's the one
that can clear my name...

01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:55.231
and he's the one who knows
who's running this conspiracy.

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:57.943
Four: I wanna know
who killed my partner.

01:02:58.109 --> 01:03:01.905
Now, if neither the informant or killer
is found in eight hours...

01:03:02.072 --> 01:03:05.033
I will kill one hostage an hour
until they're all dead.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.451
Five:

01:03:06.618 --> 01:03:09.371
I wanna talk to you
face to face now.

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:16.044
- Commander's upstairs?
- Yeah, but you can talk to me.

01:03:16.211 --> 01:03:18.338
- You're the chief?
- Yes. Travis.

01:03:18.505 --> 01:03:21.508
Nice to meet you. You're Beck?

01:03:21.675 --> 01:03:22.717
- You're...?
- Farley.

01:03:22.884 --> 01:03:24.552
Farley.

01:03:25.637 --> 01:03:27.389
All right. Vest.

01:03:28.223 --> 01:03:30.684
- You're going up there?
- Yes.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.520
- Why didn't you talk him down?
- He would have expected it.

01:03:33.687 --> 01:03:35.730
His sheet, please.

01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:40.151
- Know why he asked for me?
- We were hoping you could answer that.

01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:42.404
I can't. Psych evaluation?
Who's on it?

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.031
- That's Tonray.
- He may actually think he's innocent.

01:03:45.198 --> 01:03:48.535
We're probably gonna have to go tactical.
We've put a plan together.

01:03:48.743 --> 01:03:52.539
If we distract him long enough,
we can send in an infiltration team.

01:03:52.706 --> 01:03:55.000
- Let's wait on that.
- The wife's here.

01:03:57.168 --> 01:04:00.630
Oh, God. How is he? Has he hurt anyone?
Who's talking to him?

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:03.425
Karen, he's okay.
He asked for Chris Sabian.

01:04:03.591 --> 01:04:05.927
- Chris Sabian.
- I'm Chris Sabian.

01:04:06.094 --> 01:04:08.471
- Do you know Danny?
- No.

01:04:08.638 --> 01:04:12.225
Doesn't matter to you, but he didn't
do those things. You have to help him.

01:04:12.392 --> 01:04:15.020
I have no idea
about Danny's guilt or innocence.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.064
I'm hereto get him out safely.
So if you wanna help...

01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:21.401
go with Tonray, answer his questions,
and we'll drive you home.

01:04:21.568 --> 01:04:23.236
No. No, I'm not going home.

01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:25.780
Mrs. Roman...

01:04:25.947 --> 01:04:29.868
you bring tension and emotion to a scene
that already has too much of both.

01:04:30.035 --> 01:04:32.787
I am not leaving my husband.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:39.127
All right, fine,
but if you wanna help him, help me.

01:04:39.294 --> 01:04:41.463
I have to get up there.
He wants to talk to me.

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:44.966
Go with Tonray, answer his questions
and then stay in case we need you.

01:04:45.133 --> 01:04:48.470
- That's the best I can do.
- Karen, come with me and talk, okay?

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:49.971
It's gonna be all right.

01:04:56.519 --> 01:04:57.812
How do I get up?

01:04:57.979 --> 01:05:00.982
Take the freight elevator to 18.
Walk the rest of the way.

01:05:01.149 --> 01:05:03.151
I assume you've got all these covered.

01:05:03.318 --> 01:05:05.236
This is a shaft off Internal Affairs?

01:05:05.403 --> 01:05:07.614
That's access to the steam pipes.
It's unusable.

01:05:07.781 --> 01:05:10.992
All right. First, get his badge down there.
Second, shut off the heat.

01:05:11.159 --> 01:05:14.329
He might deal a hostage to get it back.
What channel we on'?

01:05:14.496 --> 01:05:18.291
Three. Chief, I wanna
show you something.

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:24.923
- Danny, take me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Take him. Come on.

01:05:25.298 --> 01:05:27.467
I got the asthma. You know?

01:05:29.928 --> 01:05:32.847
You can't put me in bad situations, man.

01:05:33.598 --> 01:05:37.310
For chrissakes.
Why you always pick on me?

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:40.105
I mean, who am I? Charlie Brown?

01:05:40.355 --> 01:05:42.357
You know what Nietzsche says:

01:05:43.358 --> 01:05:46.611
Even the strongest
have their moments of fatigue.

01:05:46.778 --> 01:05:48.863
And I'm fatigued, Danny.

01:05:49.364 --> 01:05:51.241
I'm fucking fatigued.

01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:10.510
- You okay?
- Do I look okay?

01:06:10.677 --> 01:06:13.680
I got a gun pointed at the back of my head.

01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:15.181
Nice fucking pants.

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:17.851
Shut up, Mr. Blackwell. Get over here.

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:23.565
- You working?
- Sort of.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:27.235
I was negotiating a truce
between my wife and daughter.

01:06:27.485 --> 01:06:29.404
That might prove to be easy
by comparison.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.198
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

01:06:32.699 --> 01:06:36.327
- So you shut off the heat already.
- You know how this works, Danny.

01:06:36.494 --> 01:06:37.996
Yeah, I do.

01:06:38.913 --> 01:06:42.208
Next time you try and bluff,
make sure you charge your cell phone.

01:06:43.376 --> 01:06:46.296
All right, now, you wanna tell me
what I'm doing up here?

01:06:46.546 --> 01:06:49.549
I wanted to tell you face to face
I'm not crazy.

01:06:49.716 --> 01:06:52.093
I'm just doing this to prove my innocence.

01:06:52.886 --> 01:06:55.597
I believe you. Anything I can do
to help you get out...

01:06:55.763 --> 01:06:57.891
Don't fucking patronize me, man.

01:06:58.057 --> 01:07:00.185
You don't think I'm innocent,
so don't tell me:

01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:02.812
"I wanna do everything I can
to help you get out."

01:07:02.979 --> 01:07:05.106
Don't talk to me
like I'm some second-rate HT.

01:07:05.273 --> 01:07:07.442
All right, you're right.
I'm sorry. My mistake.

01:07:07.817 --> 01:07:10.695
Yeah, you are sorry. Get out of here.
Lock the door.

01:07:10.862 --> 01:07:13.781
- Call when you wanna talk.
- Danny, I'm ready to talk.

01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:18.620
You're right. You're right.

01:07:19.329 --> 01:07:21.664
I don't know if you're innocent or not.

01:07:21.831 --> 01:07:23.583
You could've done everything
they say.

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:27.003
You could have killed that cop.
I don't know and I don't care.

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:30.298
There are ways to prove your innocence.
This is hardly one of them.

01:07:30.465 --> 01:07:32.884
And now you got hostages...

01:07:33.176 --> 01:07:34.802
so let me tell you this:

01:07:34.969 --> 01:07:38.973
You hurt one of them, you burn up whatever
currency you got to deal with me.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:42.894
They're all I care about. You leaving here
walking is a distant second.

01:07:43.394 --> 01:07:47.357
- Now, do I make myself clear?
- Good.

01:07:47.523 --> 01:07:49.067
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:07:49.234 --> 01:07:53.279
Good, now answer my question.
What am doing I up here?

01:07:53.446 --> 01:07:56.491
Before Nate was killed, he told me
the men involved in the fraud...

01:07:56.658 --> 01:07:59.661
are from my precinct. Guys I know.

01:07:59.827 --> 01:08:02.622
- Guys I might call friends.
- And?

01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:04.374
And you're not.

01:08:04.874 --> 01:08:06.668
When your friends betray you...

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:09.587
sometimes the only people
you can trust are strangers.

01:08:13.925 --> 01:08:16.551
Lock the door! Get out! Get out!

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:20.430
Come on! Hurry up. Lock it!
Hurry up! Come on!

01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:21.808
Hold it right there.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.603
Beck. Beck, what happened? I've lost him!
He's gone back in!

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:27.689
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.774
Get up! Get up!

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:47.207
Drop the guns! Drop them!

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:48.876
Put it down!

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:52.212
You are jeopardizing the life
of this hostage!

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.131
- Drop your gun!
- Drop your weapon!

01:08:54.299 --> 01:08:56.591
<i>Sniper team, can anyone see Roman?</i>

01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:57.801
<i>Look for the one-shot.</i>

01:09:04.142 --> 01:09:05.518
We have the target acquired.

01:09:05.685 --> 01:09:07.812
<i>- Put it down!
- Drop the weapon!</i>

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:10.481
- Drop your weapon now!
- Drop it now, Danny!

01:09:10.648 --> 01:09:12.567
Drop the gun! Drop it!

01:09:13.818 --> 01:09:15.361
Put it down! Now!

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.242
Put it down, Danny.

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:24.996
- Drop it!
- You're gonna get this man killed!

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:28.750
Drop your weapon!

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:31.085
Put your gun down!

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:33.837
Tell him! Tell him, Frost!

01:09:34.005 --> 01:09:36.090
Put the gun down now!

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.260
Drop your weapon!

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:43.264
Green light. Take the subject out.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.100
I can't believe this.

01:09:48.019 --> 01:09:50.229
<i>Palermo, take the subject out.</i>

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.196
Palermo, take the subject out!

01:09:58.863 --> 01:10:01.115
- Copy.
- Don't tell me fucking "copy"!

01:10:02.075 --> 01:10:04.410
- Pull the fucking trigger!
- Copy.

01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:14.128
I cannot take the shot.

01:10:18.383 --> 01:10:19.634
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:10:19.801 --> 01:10:22.929
- Negative, sir, I cannot take this shot.
- Have a heart!

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.893
Fuck!

01:10:29.227 --> 01:10:31.687
Palermo, bring it in. You're relieved.

01:10:46.452 --> 01:10:47.662
Kick it!

01:10:52.917 --> 01:10:56.129
- Looks like the HT's speech worked.
- Stand back.

01:10:56.587 --> 01:10:58.131
We have this.

01:11:14.105 --> 01:11:15.773
Is this your command or is it his?

01:11:17.525 --> 01:11:20.194
You had him distracted.
We saw an opportunity to end this.

01:11:20.361 --> 01:11:23.156
- We had to take it.
- You put me and those hostages at risk.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:26.325
That's what you did, and that's not
how I work. First, we talk.

01:11:26.492 --> 01:11:28.536
It was my call.

01:11:29.704 --> 01:11:32.373
We don't feel this man
can be talked down.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.376
Oh, really? I've been here a half-hour!
How do you know that?

01:11:37.879 --> 01:11:39.630
With all due respect, sir...

01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:43.050
I have kept a zero casualty rate
for five years...

01:11:43.301 --> 01:11:45.511
because this kind of action
is a last resort.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.388
This is not your command, Sabian.

01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:52.059
Yeah, that's right. My command is to get
those people out safely.

01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:54.979
- That's my command!
- You don't know this man, lieutenant!

01:11:57.482 --> 01:12:00.568
He's manipulating this situation.
Look what he did to Palermo.

01:12:00.735 --> 01:12:04.405
He's gonna fuck with every single
fucking one of you...

01:12:04.572 --> 01:12:07.200
if we give him enough time,
and he knows you'll do it.

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:10.661
- He knows how you fucking work.
- He's got a point, Sabian.

01:12:10.828 --> 01:12:12.830
We do have a chain of command.

01:12:12.997 --> 01:12:16.167
Your chain of command
has just given Danny two more hostages.

01:12:16.334 --> 01:12:21.214
Officers. You gonna take responsibility if
he takes one of them out? Because I don't!

01:12:22.215 --> 01:12:25.843
They're just waiting to take this over.
You want that to happen?

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:28.137
This is gonna be very easy for you.

01:12:28.596 --> 01:12:31.432
Roman asked for me
and he's gonna get me.

01:12:31.766 --> 01:12:33.851
We're gonna do it my way or I walk.

01:12:34.018 --> 01:12:36.729
I got no truck with leaving you
with this responsibility.

01:12:36.896 --> 01:12:40.066
Now, it's your decision,
or they're gonna fucking take it over.

01:12:45.363 --> 01:12:47.281
You have command for now.

01:12:48.741 --> 01:12:51.452
But I'm still the ranking officer
on the scene...

01:12:51.619 --> 01:12:53.454
and I will be watching.

01:12:54.705 --> 01:12:57.458
Good. You watch. Now do me a favor.

01:12:58.209 --> 01:12:59.919
Please introduce me to our team.

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:03.923
Attention...

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:07.051
this is your chief, Al Travis.

01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:11.264
I would like to introduce you
to the negotiator, Chris Sabian...

01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:15.810
who, as of now, has full command.

01:13:19.981 --> 01:13:23.568
My name is Chris Sabian, and as of
right now, all decisions go through me.

01:13:23.734 --> 01:13:25.945
No order is valid unless I give it.

01:13:26.112 --> 01:13:28.656
<i>No action is taken
unless prior approved by me.</i>

01:13:28.823 --> 01:13:31.742
<i>I know we understand each other
and that we'll work together...</i>

01:13:31.909 --> 01:13:33.911
to try to end this safely and quickly.

01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:43.296
It didn't work, Beck!
I'm still alive, motherfucker!

01:13:43.504 --> 01:13:44.922
Danny, it's Chris.

01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:48.676
Danny, Danny, listen to me.
Pick up the radio and talk to me, man.

01:13:49.385 --> 01:13:54.849
Stand back. Back. Back.
Move back.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.440
Nothing! Look!

01:14:04.233 --> 01:14:07.445
You guys with the cameras,
you get that?

01:14:07.653 --> 01:14:11.824
All I asked for was more time,
and they tried to take me out!

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:18.372
It is the policy of the Chicago police
to resolve all hostage situations...

01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:22.126
with the utmost regard
for the preservation of life!

01:14:22.293 --> 01:14:24.503
Get his wife. We might need her.

01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:34.138
You want my blood?
Take my blood! Come on!

01:14:35.014 --> 01:14:36.724
Here it is! Take it!

01:14:36.891 --> 01:14:39.060
Chief, they have a shot.
We can end it here.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:42.313
No one takes that shot.
You wanna shoot him on television?

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.649
Move the crowd. I want the area clear.

01:14:44.815 --> 01:14:46.859
Go ahead, take my blood!

01:14:47.026 --> 01:14:49.236
Go ahead, take the shot!

01:14:49.403 --> 01:14:50.905
Danny!

01:14:51.405 --> 01:14:55.576
I'm getting too close to the truth
and they wanna kill me...

01:14:55.743 --> 01:14:57.912
just like they killed Nate!

01:14:58.079 --> 01:15:00.414
Chief, give me the order.
Give the fucking order!

01:15:00.581 --> 01:15:02.541
- Wait.
- Do not take the shot!

01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:06.003
What am I gonna have to do
to be heard?

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:09.799
Am I gonna have to hurt somebody
to get respect?

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:13.678
Well, all right! All right, I Will!

01:15:18.933 --> 01:15:22.937
Danny, listen to me. Don't do that.
Don't take this to the next level.

01:15:23.521 --> 01:15:24.939
<i>Can he fucking hear me?</i>

01:15:25.106 --> 01:15:26.107
<i>Does he have a radio?</i>

01:15:26.273 --> 01:15:28.526
Think you can come in here
and just shoot me?

01:15:28.693 --> 01:15:33.030
They send you to kill me and you just do it?
You just think you can get away with it?

01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:35.241
I know you're one of them.
I know you are.

01:15:35.408 --> 01:15:37.785
Now you're gonna fucking pay
for doing that!

01:15:37.952 --> 01:15:41.789
Danny. Danny, do not hurt anyone.
Do not do that, all right?

01:15:41.956 --> 01:15:43.290
I am in command here.

01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:46.210
<i>No one is gonna breach.
No one is gonna come in.</i>

01:15:46.377 --> 01:15:49.922
No one is gonna do anything
without my authority. I'm in control here.

01:15:50.089 --> 01:15:54.093
You are not in control! They are!
They're not listening to you, Chris.

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.596
<i>So I'm gonna show them
why they should!</i>

01:15:57.763 --> 01:16:00.474
One of the son-of-a-bitches
you sent in is about to die!

01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:04.645
And every time you try to come in,
this will happen!

01:16:04.812 --> 01:16:07.815
Now move! Move!

01:16:08.983 --> 01:16:11.235
Get in there. Get in there!

01:16:11.402 --> 01:16:13.237
Down! Down!

01:16:13.779 --> 01:16:16.657
Are you one of them, Scott?
One of the men that set me up?

01:16:16.907 --> 01:16:19.076
Is that why you want me dead?

01:16:20.494 --> 01:16:21.912
<i>It's</i> me, Karen.

01:16:22.913 --> 01:16:24.874
Danny, please talk to me.

01:17:06.707 --> 01:17:08.209
Oh, my God.

01:17:13.214 --> 01:17:18.177
Do not come in here again.

01:17:27.937 --> 01:17:29.563
Karen, I'm sorry.

01:17:38.823 --> 01:17:40.908
Cut the electric. Cut it now.

01:17:41.075 --> 01:17:45.663
<i>After hours of little action,
we've witnessed a flurry of activity...</i>

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:48.582
<i>on the 20th floor of the Chicago
administration building.</i>

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:51.544
<i>And it looks like there's a
little more action going on now.</i>

01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:53.170
<i>They've cleared the barricades.</i>

01:17:53.337 --> 01:17:56.257
<i>Looks like plainclothes...
Actually, those are federal sedans...</i>

01:17:56.423 --> 01:17:59.343
<i>FBI agents, in fact,
arriving on the scene.</i>

01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:02.596
<i>This is a major development for this story,
because up until now...</i>

01:18:02.763 --> 01:18:06.392
<i>this negotiation has been handled
by the Chicago police department.</i>

01:18:06.559 --> 01:18:10.437
<i>With the arrival of the feds, they are
either coming to aid in the negotiation...</i>

01:18:10.604 --> 01:18:14.525
or <i>perhaps, more likely,
to take over the negotiations.</i>

01:18:14.692 --> 01:18:18.571
<i>But that is all speculation. All we know
is that they are now on the scene...</i>

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:20.364
<i>and we'll have to wait and seem...</i>

01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:23.659
What have you done, Danny?

01:18:23.826 --> 01:18:27.538
Danny, you just fucked yourself completely.
You killed a cop!

01:18:27.705 --> 01:18:30.541
You killed an innocent man!

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:32.209
He wasn't innocent.

01:18:32.418 --> 01:18:35.379
He's one of them. He tried to kill me.

01:18:37.423 --> 01:18:43.262
I told you all when I came in here
I wasn't leaving till I got the truth.

01:18:53.105 --> 01:18:56.150
I don't care how long it takes.

01:18:58.152 --> 01:19:00.362
You could've prevented this.

01:19:03.908 --> 01:19:06.410
Why don't you just
tell him something, Niebaum?

01:19:08.162 --> 01:19:10.497
Why don't you just fucking
tell him anything?

01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:13.125
Inspector?

01:19:20.007 --> 01:19:21.091
Five years, Maggie.

01:19:21.634 --> 01:19:23.177
You must know something.

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:26.847
- Please, inspector.
- Maggie.

01:19:27.014 --> 01:19:30.184
He already lied when he knew it would
cost someone their life.

01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:33.854
Now, if you know something, anything,
you tell me now.

01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:39.360
He keeps all his personal files
on the computer.

01:19:40.653 --> 01:19:43.280
I'm not supposed to know about them,
but I do.

01:19:45.491 --> 01:19:49.828
There's a lot of stuff on there.
Probably could help you.

01:19:50.996 --> 01:19:52.498
Frost.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.459
Unlock yourself. Get the computer.

01:19:56.293 --> 01:19:57.836
I just saw your troops moving in.

01:19:58.003 --> 01:20:01.465
I don't want a situation where you
and the ATF take over the situation...

01:20:01.632 --> 01:20:04.393
without any fucking evidence whatsoever.
I don't want you going in.

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:08.555
I want a guarantee before the
press starts that I have an hour.

01:20:08.722 --> 01:20:10.099
- Phone's ringing.
- I know.

01:20:10.265 --> 01:20:13.227
- Another hour. I want a guarantee.
- You gonna answer the phone?

01:20:13.394 --> 01:20:15.646
- Yes. Thank you.
- You have one shot.

01:20:23.487 --> 01:20:25.572
Are you gonna get that or what?

01:20:27.825 --> 01:20:30.911
- Yes.
- Sorry to interrupt. What took you so long?

01:20:31.078 --> 01:20:32.413
- I'm busy.
<i>- Busy?</i>

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:35.916
A piece of advice: Never keep
a hostage-taker waiting. It pisses him off.

01:20:44.049 --> 01:20:46.343
Relax. He'll call back.

01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:55.102
Who the fuck
you think you're dealing with...?

01:20:57.104 --> 01:21:00.941
If you have a problem, lieutenant,
maybe you wanna let us handle this.

01:21:01.108 --> 01:21:04.028
Tell him I'm on my way up.
Please, tell him.

01:21:08.574 --> 01:21:11.285
- Farley, get the phone.
- Yeah.

01:21:15.789 --> 01:21:17.750
- Sabian...
- No, <i>it's</i> Far...

01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:23.756
Danny, Chris is on his way up.

01:21:38.479 --> 01:21:40.647
We need to reopen negotiations.

01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:44.985
- I'm sorry. You want something from me?
- I want the electricity turned back on.

01:21:45.152 --> 01:21:47.321
You want something...

01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:49.323
from me?

01:21:52.576 --> 01:21:55.329
You think killing a man
gives you the power to negotiate?

01:21:56.622 --> 01:21:59.458
Why is that, Danny Roman?
Because you think you know me?

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:03.212
Because you think you can trust me?

01:22:03.378 --> 01:22:07.007
You think you know what I'm gonna do,
that I'm gonna give you time?

01:22:07.174 --> 01:22:08.801
Don't you fucking count on it.

01:22:12.179 --> 01:22:14.181
Right now, I'm the only
thing between you...

01:22:14.348 --> 01:22:17.851
and an army that's just itching
to walk in here and take you out.

01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:22.022
So you tell me something, Danny.
Why should I get in their way?

01:22:23.273 --> 01:22:26.151
Make me believe
why I should deal with you...

01:22:26.318 --> 01:22:28.112
ever again.

01:22:29.029 --> 01:22:30.864
I still have hostages.

01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:34.201
They can still be punished
for your mistakes.

01:22:34.993 --> 01:22:37.246
What was that, a threat?
Did you just threaten me?

01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:38.872
That's all I need to walk out.

01:22:39.039 --> 01:22:40.999
The rules of engagement state...

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:45.879
you don't risk a breach if the hostage-taker
is willing to kill in retaliation.

01:22:46.046 --> 01:22:48.382
And I think I've proved
I'm willing to do that.

01:22:58.809 --> 01:23:00.894
Things are not what they seem, Chris.

01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:03.897
You saw what they did.

01:23:04.565 --> 01:23:08.569
They didn't tell you they were coming in,
because they want me dead.

01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:23.375
One more gun goes off...

01:23:23.542 --> 01:23:26.920
and I'm gonna give the order
to move in myself. You understand?

01:23:29.047 --> 01:23:32.593
Don't think you've bought anything
by asking me to come here.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:37.723
Because you need to remember
I am a stranger to you.

01:23:38.599 --> 01:23:41.518
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

01:23:47.983 --> 01:23:49.693
I need the electricity...

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:53.071
so I can turn on that computer
and get a look at Niebaum's files.

01:23:53.405 --> 01:23:56.909
I also want food and blankets
for the hostages.

01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:01.705
I'll need a hostage. Nothing less.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:07.794
Take Frost.

01:24:11.965 --> 01:24:15.427
- Turn the electricity back on.
- Could you <i>repeat</i> that, Sabian?

01:24:16.136 --> 01:24:19.598
I'm about to walk outwith a hostage.
Do what I say.

01:24:19.848 --> 01:24:22.226
Turn the electricity back on.

01:25:08.355 --> 01:25:11.942
Credit-card fraud and electronic theft.
That's you, right, Rudy?

01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:16.530
Well, I got caught for credit-card fraud
and electronic theft...

01:25:16.697 --> 01:25:18.782
but the list goes on, you know.

01:25:22.327 --> 01:25:24.997
Look, I could sit here all night
and get nothing.

01:25:25.289 --> 01:25:27.624
You know?
What kind of security has this thing got?

01:25:34.172 --> 01:25:36.133
F1, enter.

01:25:38.885 --> 01:25:40.345
C...

01:25:40.512 --> 01:25:41.888
dash I dash COM.

01:25:45.517 --> 01:25:47.227
G-9.

01:25:55.652 --> 01:25:57.529
- Run a search.
- Well...

01:25:57.696 --> 01:26:00.991
Look for anything that has to do
with the disability fund.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:11.251
There's a lot of added security here.

01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:16.006
It's not bad.
It's just outdated by six months.

01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:18.842
Fucking cops.
Always two steps behind.

01:26:29.102 --> 01:26:31.688
He's looking for people
to believe in him.

01:26:33.565 --> 01:26:35.692
I don't think I helped the situation.

01:26:36.735 --> 01:26:38.737
Then he shoots Scott.

01:26:45.118 --> 01:26:48.538
Christ. I couldn't do anything.

01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:53.710
Frost.

01:26:53.877 --> 01:26:55.837
It would be helpful
if you could tell me...

01:26:56.004 --> 01:27:00.467
about Danny's relationship to the fund,
his case and specifically, this informant.

01:27:00.634 --> 01:27:02.886
Anything you might have overheard
or know...

01:27:03.053 --> 01:27:05.889
that might be of use to me,
that you think is pertinent.

01:27:07.099 --> 01:27:08.266
Sure.

01:27:12.312 --> 01:27:13.647
"Disability fund.

01:27:13.814 --> 01:27:16.316
Subdirectories: Wires and taps."

01:27:16.608 --> 01:27:19.152
- Click on wires.
- Okay.

01:27:21.822 --> 01:27:23.490
Oh, man, there's a lot of wires.

01:27:23.657 --> 01:27:26.660
- What are these numbers?
- Cops' badge numbers.

01:27:27.744 --> 01:27:29.162
Okay, now scroll down.

01:27:30.497 --> 01:27:33.667
Stop, stop, stop. Back up one.

01:27:35.752 --> 01:27:37.504
That's Nate's badge. Okay.

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:41.675
Click that.

01:27:50.684 --> 01:27:52.686
<i>Well, they did do an audit...</i>

01:27:52.853 --> 01:27:54.646
<i>but they didn't prove anything.</i>

01:27:54.813 --> 01:27:56.148
Hey, that's my voice...

01:27:56.815 --> 01:27:59.109
<i>Somebody's taking our money.
We gotta find out who it is.</i>

01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:01.862
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:28:03.196 --> 01:28:05.991
You son of a bitch.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.368
You were tapping Nate.

01:28:08.535 --> 01:28:11.455
You knew he was
investigating the fraud.

01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:14.374
- You lied.
- Fuck you!

01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:17.210
And then you killed him
because he was getting too close.

01:28:17.878 --> 01:28:20.505
Tap a lot of cops. There's only one killer
in this room.

01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:23.216
I'm not the killer here, you are.

01:28:23.717 --> 01:28:27.804
Scroll back to October 12th,
the night before Nate was killed.

01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:32.017
- There's only one recording.
- Click on it!

01:28:32.184 --> 01:28:33.685
All right, all right.

01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.855
Are you gonna <i>talk</i> to me?

01:28:37.731 --> 01:28:40.609
<i>It's that case I'm working on. It's...</i>

01:28:44.613 --> 01:28:47.324
<i>Look, I'll just be a minute.
Sorry, honey. I won't be long.</i>

01:28:47.491 --> 01:28:50.452
<i>I just wanna see if he's here, you know?</i>

01:28:50.619 --> 01:28:53.747
<i>I don't wanna talk to him on the phone.
It's just not...</i>

01:28:54.623 --> 01:28:58.710
<i>I'll see you soon, okay?
I'll just be a minute.</i>

01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:02.923
- Okay.
<i>- Okay?</i>

01:29:03.089 --> 01:29:05.926
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

01:29:07.677 --> 01:29:09.554
He was going to see his informant,
wasn't he?

01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:12.265
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:29:12.432 --> 01:29:16.603
The night before Nate was killed he told me
he had just talked to his informant.

01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:18.271
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:19.773 --> 01:29:20.941
You knew that too.

01:29:24.611 --> 01:29:26.404
What's going on here, Niebaum?

01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:29.282
Why can't you find this guy?

01:29:29.449 --> 01:29:33.453
You gotta be looking for him
so you can shut him up too!

01:29:37.582 --> 01:29:39.668
You don't know who he is, do you?

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.338
Linda wouldn't tell you where they went
that night, would she?

01:29:43.547 --> 01:29:46.716
Because she thinks you're
as guilty as I am.

01:30:01.481 --> 01:30:04.109
<i>- Go ahead.
- Is this a private line?</i>

01:30:04.317 --> 01:30:06.444
- You need it to be?
- Yeah.

01:30:09.197 --> 01:30:10.323
Sorry.

01:30:10.991 --> 01:30:11.992
Go ahead.

01:30:13.243 --> 01:30:15.829
I need you to talk to Linda Roenick,
Nate's wife.

01:30:15.996 --> 01:30:17.330
<i>About what?</i>

01:30:18.582 --> 01:30:22.294
I found some taps that prove
Niebaum's been lying all along.

01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:25.630
I heard something on one of them.
I need you to ask Linda about it.

01:30:25.797 --> 01:30:27.340
You and only you.

01:30:28.633 --> 01:30:30.093
What do you want me to ask her?

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:34.014
<i>Ask her where she and Nate went
on October 12th, the night before he died.</i>

01:30:34.431 --> 01:30:35.473
<i>Who he talked to.</i>

01:30:36.349 --> 01:30:40.478
If she tells you who he saw,
I'll give you another hostage.

01:30:40.645 --> 01:30:43.607
If she tells you nothing, you get nothing.

01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:46.401
Have my hostage ready.

01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:53.366
Yes.

01:30:54.492 --> 01:30:55.702
Yes.

01:30:56.036 --> 01:30:58.997
Great. All right.

01:30:59.164 --> 01:31:00.874
- Excuse me.
- I gotta go.

01:31:01.124 --> 01:31:02.751
- Can we have a word?
- Yes.

01:31:02.917 --> 01:31:06.880
Hellman's been studying the blueprints
with Beck. They have a suggestion.

01:31:07.047 --> 01:31:08.381
You do take suggestions?

01:31:10.884 --> 01:31:14.763
Hellman thinks we can get a team
in the vent system right above Roman.

01:31:14.929 --> 01:31:19.517
What we're suggesting is getting men
in place for a crisis entry. Just one unit.

01:31:19.684 --> 01:31:20.810
Only as a precaution.

01:31:20.977 --> 01:31:24.522
With this type of entry, we can control him
in case he starts shooting hostages.

01:31:25.565 --> 01:31:29.569
We can go in there strong,
two, three seconds from bang to bullets.

01:31:29.736 --> 01:31:31.821
Sabian, we're not asking
for a full breach.

01:31:31.988 --> 01:31:34.240
We have a real concern
he may kill one of our men.

01:31:34.407 --> 01:31:38.203
That may not mean much to you,
but it means a hell of a lot to us.

01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:39.621
Beck, please.

01:31:39.788 --> 01:31:42.290
Chris, I just wanna be ready to go
if we need to.

01:31:42.457 --> 01:31:46.336
I agree with the commander's assessment,
and I do care if our team is injured...

01:31:46.503 --> 01:31:49.255
but they don't move an inch,
no mater what Danny does...

01:31:49.422 --> 01:31:51.049
without my authorization.

01:31:51.216 --> 01:31:54.344
- Gentlemen?
- Without a doubt.

01:31:57.931 --> 01:31:59.766
Sabian.

01:32:20.954 --> 01:32:26.167
Allen, we're gonna make an opportunity.
We'll take him out if we get the shot.

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:28.044
Right.

01:32:34.342 --> 01:32:36.052
How you holding up?

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.138
Good.

01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:40.306
Why don't you take a little break?

01:32:43.476 --> 01:32:46.479
I'm gonna get us inside.
We're gonna end this thing.

01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:49.065
Let's do it.

01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.239
- Anybody gotta use the bathroom?
- Yes, I do.

01:32:56.406 --> 01:32:58.032
Me too.

01:33:02.996 --> 01:33:04.372
Where is it, Maggie?

01:33:04.581 --> 01:33:07.083
There's one across the street
in a nice restaurant...

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:09.669
but I'm sure that's probably out
of the question.

01:33:09.836 --> 01:33:13.131
You can use that one
if you can hold it till we get out of here.

01:33:14.591 --> 01:33:16.301
There's one down the hall.

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:19.846
Thank you.

01:33:24.893 --> 01:33:27.020
When she's gone, use this.

01:33:34.444 --> 01:33:37.363
You bet, we need to contain
the building. I need teams on 19...

01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:39.115
20 and 21.

01:33:39.282 --> 01:33:41.159
- Yes, sir.
- And secure the lobby.

01:33:41.326 --> 01:33:43.036
Yes, sir.

01:33:47.624 --> 01:33:50.084
- What the hell is Sabian doing up there?
- No idea.

01:33:50.251 --> 01:33:53.797
Guy came in about an hour ago.
They've been talking ever since.

01:34:11.439 --> 01:34:13.691
Why the hell is this taking so long?

01:34:13.858 --> 01:34:17.654
They're trying to wear down Danny
so he gets tired.

01:34:19.405 --> 01:34:23.076
Why the hell do you have all these cops
and their accounts in here, Niebaum?

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:27.705
Why are you investigating a fraud
that you're part of?

01:34:27.997 --> 01:34:30.083
I'm not part of any fraud.

01:34:32.544 --> 01:34:36.422
Did you out find these cops were skimming
from the fund and you blackmailed them?

01:34:37.048 --> 01:34:38.716
Is that how it works?

01:34:39.592 --> 01:34:42.595
Why these cops? These guys
don't have access to the money.

01:34:42.762 --> 01:34:45.723
Well, it's basically
insurance fraud, right?

01:34:46.391 --> 01:34:48.768
- What?
- It's...

01:34:49.519 --> 01:34:50.603
Somebody...

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:54.774
Some of these guys on this list
submit false claims.

01:34:54.941 --> 01:34:59.612
It's like this auto-body thing I pulled...
I mean, some guy I know...

01:35:00.071 --> 01:35:04.826
He would tell the insurance company
his car had been wrecked, right?

01:35:04.993 --> 01:35:07.495
- It's very simple.
- And then?

01:35:07.662 --> 01:35:11.708
Well, he'd never get paid
if the claims agent wasn't in on it.

01:35:11.875 --> 01:35:15.795
So you need somebody with access to put
the paperwork through, then cover it up.

01:35:15.962 --> 01:35:17.297
Bingo.

01:35:20.884 --> 01:35:22.969
That's where you come in.

01:35:23.136 --> 01:35:25.013
Isn't it, Roman?

01:35:30.393 --> 01:35:32.812
All right, what is this, Sabian?
Who is this?

01:35:33.813 --> 01:35:35.565
You're about to find out.

01:35:50.747 --> 01:35:52.665
- Danny?
- You talk to Linda?

01:35:52.832 --> 01:35:55.501
I've done one better.
I found your informant.

01:35:55.668 --> 01:35:58.671
You're gonna end up giving me
all my hostages.

01:36:03.134 --> 01:36:04.844
Sergeant Cale Wangro.

01:36:07.013 --> 01:36:08.181
He knows who's involved.

01:36:08.473 --> 01:36:11.017
<i>He was afraid to come forward
after Nathan was killed...</i>

01:36:11.184 --> 01:36:13.519
and he wasn't sure whether
you were involved.

01:36:13.686 --> 01:36:14.729
Well, who was it?

01:36:14.896 --> 01:36:18.691
Listen, Danny.
This is gonna implicate too many people.

01:36:18.858 --> 01:36:23.029
So the FBI is here. They're ready to take
his statement to ensure impartiality.

01:36:23.488 --> 01:36:26.950
But I cannot have this go over the air,
all right, so it's over, Danny.

01:36:27.116 --> 01:36:29.369
It's done. Come on out.

01:36:29.953 --> 01:36:32.497
- Get my wife in there.
- Get his wife.

01:36:36.167 --> 01:36:38.544
- They found the informant.
- Oh, thank God!

01:36:38.711 --> 01:36:41.214
Yes! Thank God!

01:36:41.381 --> 01:36:43.716
Congratulations, Maggie.
You are free to go.

01:36:44.342 --> 01:36:49.222
Inspector, fuck you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:36:49.806 --> 01:36:54.143
Let my people go, man!
Come on, man. Give it up.

01:36:56.354 --> 01:36:57.563
Chris, hold on a second.

01:37:00.358 --> 01:37:04.070
<i>We were at the
academy. We worked at Area 6 together.</i>

01:37:04.988 --> 01:37:07.699
Chris, put Nate's informant on.

01:37:07.865 --> 01:37:09.575
Danny, I don't want this broadcast.

01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:12.662
Look, if he can clear my name,
I wanna talk to him, now.

01:37:24.257 --> 01:37:25.550
Danny, this is Cale.

01:37:25.717 --> 01:37:29.053
Hi, Cale. Very brave of you
to come down like this.

01:37:29.804 --> 01:37:31.431
You know
I have a lot of questions.

01:37:31.681 --> 01:37:35.268
<i>Let's just start
with who was involved...</i>

01:37:35.435 --> 01:37:37.603
in this conspiracy, for 500, Cale.

01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:41.357
I can't name names,
not in front of everyone here.

01:37:41.524 --> 01:37:44.902
- Wouldn't be appropriate.
- I don't wanna hear about appropriate.

01:37:45.403 --> 01:37:47.864
Just tell me who was involved.
Now, who was it?

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:50.116
<i>Men you know, Danny.</i>

01:37:51.117 --> 01:37:52.285
<i>There may be others...</i>

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.624
but I only know the names of
the key players.

01:38:00.793 --> 01:38:02.712
Don't make me say their names.

01:38:08.426 --> 01:38:09.886
Why didn't you go see Niebaum?

01:38:10.053 --> 01:38:14.307
I didn't know if Niebaum
was getting paid off to be quiet or not.

01:38:14.474 --> 01:38:17.894
I couldn't trust him or Internal Affairs.

01:38:18.144 --> 01:38:22.648
- I did hear his name mentioned.
- So Niebaum was definitely involved.

01:38:25.401 --> 01:38:27.236
Thanks, Cale.

01:38:27.612 --> 01:38:28.946
Now, how did you know Nate?

01:38:30.656 --> 01:38:31.908
From the academy.

01:38:33.618 --> 01:38:34.994
How long you been on the job?

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:39.290
- Since '74. Why?
- When's the last time you met with Nate?

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.585
The night before he died.

01:38:44.504 --> 01:38:45.755
Good.

01:38:45.922 --> 01:38:48.341
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:38:50.384 --> 01:38:51.677
Dan.

01:38:55.515 --> 01:38:56.682
Hold on, Cale.

01:39:29.382 --> 01:39:30.967
Sorry...

01:39:31.342 --> 01:39:36.139
So Nate tells me, you played ball
with him at Colorado State, that right?

01:39:36.889 --> 01:39:39.225
Yeah, but what's this
have to do with anything?

01:39:39.684 --> 01:39:41.894
Well, he went to Arizona State, Cale.

01:39:46.399 --> 01:39:47.525
Put Chris on the phone.

01:39:58.536 --> 01:40:01.497
<i>Nice try, Sabian.
Your little bluff didn't work.</i>

01:40:04.083 --> 01:40:09.422
Niebaum told me Nate was his informant.
See, he worked for IAD.

01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:12.216
Worked for Niebaum all along.
He was describing himself.

01:40:12.383 --> 01:40:13.676
Just didn't want me to know.

01:40:13.843 --> 01:40:17.263
Now, Niebaum says he was not
part of the murder.

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:19.098
What's going on here, Sabian?

01:40:19.265 --> 01:40:22.518
- He's using our bluff against Niebaum.
- He's <i>willing</i> to testify.

01:40:22.685 --> 01:40:26.397
He'll name names if you grant him immunity
on the murder charge.

01:40:26.564 --> 01:40:29.442
You call me back if we have <i> a </i> deal.

01:40:31.694 --> 01:40:32.737
Danny, talk...

01:40:34.864 --> 01:40:36.199
We've been made.

01:40:37.241 --> 01:40:40.286
What are you doing? I didn't make a deal.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:40:40.453 --> 01:40:42.121
They think you did, Niebaum.

01:40:42.705 --> 01:40:46.584
But there is no "they," right?
So you don't shit have to worry about.

01:40:50.588 --> 01:40:52.548
This was a bluff?

01:40:53.591 --> 01:40:56.928
- That all depends on your position.
- Did you know about this, Frost?

01:40:57.094 --> 01:40:59.555
No. No, I didn't.

01:40:59.722 --> 01:41:02.642
I told him what I knew
about Nathan's informant.

01:41:03.226 --> 01:41:05.561
This is how you use that information?

01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:08.481
Making us think he's innocent
after all those...

01:41:08.648 --> 01:41:10.441
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:41:10.608 --> 01:41:13.569
I can use information any way I want
to try to end this.

01:41:13.736 --> 01:41:16.656
I don't know who's innocent.
That's what I'm trying to find out.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.660
Don't call me in here
to be part of your charades again.

01:41:21.827 --> 01:41:23.329
Karen, you...

01:41:23.496 --> 01:41:25.331
Get him back.

01:41:29.919 --> 01:41:31.337
Karen.

01:41:31.504 --> 01:41:33.089
Karen.

01:41:33.673 --> 01:41:36.801
Karen, right now,
understand I don't know who to trust.

01:41:37.969 --> 01:41:39.971
Up there or in there.

01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:43.182
The bluff wasn't just for Danny.

01:41:49.522 --> 01:41:50.648
Move, Rudy.

01:41:50.815 --> 01:41:51.941
Move!

01:42:02.201 --> 01:42:03.703
Who killed Nate?

01:42:05.997 --> 01:42:08.874
They killed Nate, Niebaum.
Think they won't kill you?

01:42:16.090 --> 01:42:17.925
Fuck it.

01:42:21.053 --> 01:42:22.555
Fuck are you doing?

01:42:22.722 --> 01:42:24.390
Where are you taking me? No!

01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:26.100
I know nothing!

01:42:26.267 --> 01:42:28.477
They're gonna take me out
because you set me up!

01:42:28.686 --> 01:42:31.397
You'll get another innocent man killed!
I know nothing!

01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:34.233
Don't put me in that fucking room!

01:42:37.403 --> 01:42:38.571
Okay, okay!

01:42:38.738 --> 01:42:40.156
Don't put me in that room!

01:42:43.409 --> 01:42:45.953
Nate. Nate came to me with taps.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.664
I went to the guys who were implicated
in the taps.

01:42:48.831 --> 01:42:52.501
They offered me money to lose
the evidence. I did it.

01:42:52.668 --> 01:42:55.087
Okay? It was a one-time deal!

01:42:55.755 --> 01:42:58.591
They offered the same thing to Nate.
They killed him.

01:42:58.758 --> 01:43:01.344
- Who's on the taps?
- Get me out of this fucking...

01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:03.888
- Who's on the fucking taps?
- All your friends!

01:43:04.055 --> 01:43:05.264
Who?

01:43:05.431 --> 01:43:06.891
Argento...

01:43:07.058 --> 01:43:08.601
Hellman, Allen. Yeah.

01:43:08.768 --> 01:43:10.186
- That's bullshit!
- No.

01:43:10.353 --> 01:43:12.438
I have proof! I have them on taps...

01:43:13.105 --> 01:43:16.108
talking about how they took money
out of the fund.

01:43:16.442 --> 01:43:18.944
They couldn't do that themselves.
Who's in charge?

01:43:19.111 --> 01:43:20.571
I don't know.

01:43:21.113 --> 01:43:23.366
- Are those taps on this computer?
- No.

01:43:23.532 --> 01:43:24.575
Where are they?

01:43:24.742 --> 01:43:26.994
I have them somewhere safe!

01:43:28.454 --> 01:43:31.791
<i>Air Tac 1,
civilian unit approaching. Peel away.</i>

01:43:35.586 --> 01:43:38.381
You are flying in a government
crime-scene airspace.

01:43:38.547 --> 01:43:41.759
<i>It is imperative you respect

01:43:41.967 --> 01:43:43.803
<i>Turn away from the building.</i>

01:43:43.969 --> 01:43:47.306
<i>I repeat, turn away from the building.</i>

01:44:01.445 --> 01:44:04.281
- Who's firing?
- Down! Down! Everyone down!

01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:07.159
Who the hell just fired?

01:44:09.578 --> 01:44:12.915
<i>- Initiate</i> breach.
- No, no, no! Do not breach!

01:44:16.001 --> 01:44:18.337

Team's position has been compromised.

01:44:21.173 --> 01:44:23.342
- Send in Unit 1.
- Kill the lights, Unit 1.

01:44:46.365 --> 01:44:48.367
<i>Unit 1, give me status.</i>

01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:49.869
Unit 1, we're coming in.

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:57.543
Fuck!

01:45:02.882 --> 01:45:04.049
<i>Move!</i>

01:45:08.804 --> 01:45:10.681
He's got flashbangs!

01:45:11.849 --> 01:45:13.726
Move! Move!

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.235
Fuck!

01:45:24.361 --> 01:45:26.238
Get down!

01:45:32.119 --> 01:45:33.370
<i>Take him out.</i>

01:45:33.537 --> 01:45:34.955
Take the subject out.

01:45:35.122 --> 01:45:36.165
Do not fire!

01:45:36.332 --> 01:45:38.834
Do not! I did not give the order!
Do not!

01:45:45.341 --> 01:45:47.218
Terminate this breach.

01:46:21.752 --> 01:46:22.920
Danny, can you hear me?

01:46:27.591 --> 01:46:29.718
Maggie, you okay?

01:46:30.052 --> 01:46:31.136
Rudy? Markus?

01:46:35.474 --> 01:46:37.226
Oh, Shit. Shit!

01:46:37.726 --> 01:46:38.769
They shot him.

01:46:40.646 --> 01:46:42.898
Hold on, inspector. Just hold on.

01:46:43.065 --> 01:46:45.442
I'll get somebody up here to help you.

01:46:45.609 --> 01:46:46.652
Come on.

01:46:47.278 --> 01:46:48.821
Danny, can you hear me?

01:46:49.446 --> 01:46:51.615
Danny, is anyone else hurt up there?

01:46:51.824 --> 01:46:53.826
Come on, come on. Down.

01:46:54.243 --> 01:46:55.995
Danny, is anyone hurt up there?

01:46:59.832 --> 01:47:01.750
Come on. Hold on.

01:47:02.001 --> 01:47:03.961
I'm gonna get somebody. Come on.

01:47:08.215 --> 01:47:10.175
Get somebody up here! Niebaum's been...

01:47:12.177 --> 01:47:13.637
Oh, God.

01:47:23.522 --> 01:47:24.857
He's dead!

01:47:26.358 --> 01:47:29.194
<i>You hear that, Chris? They killed him.</i>

01:47:29.361 --> 01:47:31.488
Holy Jesus.

01:47:35.242 --> 01:47:37.036
Danny, are you shot?

01:47:44.752 --> 01:47:47.004
<i>Danny, is anyone hurt up there?</i>

01:47:47.838 --> 01:47:50.049
<i>Anyone else hurt up there?</i>

01:47:53.177 --> 01:47:56.513
What the hell happened? I step out
of this room and someone gets killed?

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.099
It was an accident.
What did you expect my men to do?

01:47:59.266 --> 01:48:01.226
A gun went off. Any idea who shot first?

01:48:01.393 --> 01:48:05.397
What the fuck are you accusing us of?
My men responded to a situation!

01:48:05.564 --> 01:48:07.941
If a firecracker goes off,
you respond the same way?

01:48:08.108 --> 01:48:10.402
We don't know what happened.
What did we agree to?

01:48:10.569 --> 01:48:13.864
That no matter what, no one goes in
without my authority.

01:48:14.031 --> 01:48:15.741
That's what we agreed on.

01:48:15.908 --> 01:48:19.161
You got no eyes, you got no ears,
you got nothing but assumptions!

01:48:19.912 --> 01:48:22.706
I called for the breach. It was conducted
with my authority.

01:48:22.873 --> 01:48:23.999
Not anymore.

01:48:26.085 --> 01:48:29.755
We're taking over. FBI cannot
stand by and let this situation continue.

01:48:29.922 --> 01:48:33.425
- Don't take me off. Listen to me.
- We're asking you to leave, lieutenant.

01:48:33.592 --> 01:48:36.220
All right, I bluffed him,
but he knows what I was doing.

01:48:36.387 --> 01:48:37.680
We need to rotate your men...

01:48:37.846 --> 01:48:40.557
He thinks someone
just tried to kill him!

01:48:40.724 --> 01:48:42.226
We're going in. Full breach.

01:48:42.685 --> 01:48:45.229
Don't do it. Listen.
You breach, everyone's gonna die.

01:48:45.396 --> 01:48:47.272
Understand that? Everyone's gonna die.

01:48:47.439 --> 01:48:50.401
Maybe that's what some of you
wanna have happen, but I don't!

01:48:50.567 --> 01:48:54.071
I was brought here to save this man's life
and bring him out, all right?

01:48:54.238 --> 01:48:56.448
There's no reason
to jeopardize hostages.

01:48:56.615 --> 01:48:57.950
Shut up!

01:48:59.952 --> 01:49:03.747
Agent Moran, this is a mistake.
You wanna change negotiators, fine.

01:49:03.914 --> 01:49:06.583
But you give Roman a 30-second
window of opportunity...

01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:08.210
he'll exploit it.

01:49:09.461 --> 01:49:12.256
We gotta keep him locked down.
My men can handle it.

01:49:12.423 --> 01:49:14.842
We've seen what your men can handle.

01:49:15.008 --> 01:49:16.051
Please.

01:49:16.218 --> 01:49:18.721
Your men stay in place.
Our men will support yours...

01:49:18.887 --> 01:49:22.141
- but you'll execute orders that we give.
- You're off, Sabian.

01:49:23.142 --> 01:49:26.979
I can't believe this. I'm just surrounded
by people who wanna go in and kill him.

01:49:27.146 --> 01:49:31.400
This is the guy you called your friend.
I got nothing invested in this!

01:49:32.609 --> 01:49:34.653
I wonder why that is!

01:49:36.613 --> 01:49:38.323
Maybe someday we'll find out.

01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:40.409
No more negotiating.

01:49:41.076 --> 01:49:43.954
Would you please escort Mr. Sabian
to his car?

01:49:44.872 --> 01:49:45.956
Lieutenant.

01:49:46.665 --> 01:49:47.958
This way, sir.

01:49:48.667 --> 01:49:50.878
Dying to go up.
You call yourselves his friends.

01:49:51.044 --> 01:49:54.173
Danny Roman,
this is Agent Grey of the FBI.

01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:57.676
Chris Sabian has been relieved
of his command and I'm in charge.

01:49:59.261 --> 01:50:02.556
<i>As of this moment,
all negotiations are suspended.</i>

01:50:02.723 --> 01:50:05.017
<i>You have five minutes to surrender...</i>

01:50:05.184 --> 01:50:07.019
or we're coming in after you.

01:50:18.989 --> 01:50:21.825
Oh, Christ. Sabian's going in.

01:50:23.494 --> 01:50:25.829
Danny, it's me. I'm on my way up.

01:50:29.041 --> 01:50:32.961
Danny, this wasn't your fault.
We all heard him confess. He was guilty.

01:50:33.921 --> 01:50:35.172
Yeah.

01:50:36.298 --> 01:50:38.175
Well, what's it matter, Maggie?

01:50:39.009 --> 01:50:41.553
Nate's dead. Niebaum's dead.

01:50:42.471 --> 01:50:43.514
Computer's dead.

01:50:44.056 --> 01:50:48.435
And, look, Sabian is coming upstairs now.

01:50:48.602 --> 01:50:50.687
You have to tell him what Niebaum said.

01:50:51.355 --> 01:50:55.400
What, you gonna give up now?
Come on, that'd be a crime, man.

01:51:02.366 --> 01:51:04.201
Listen, all of you...

01:51:05.744 --> 01:51:07.746
I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:51:08.705 --> 01:51:10.541
This'll all be over soon.

01:51:11.917 --> 01:51:15.671
<i>Danny, pick up
the phone or we will be forced to come in.</i>

01:51:17.089 --> 01:51:20.676
Maggie, would you tell my wife
something for me?

01:51:22.344 --> 01:51:24.596
Just tell her I was trying
to keep my promise.

01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:34.273
Hey, Danny.

01:51:34.439 --> 01:51:38.193
You know, Niebaum worked at home
just about as much as he worked here.

01:51:40.279 --> 01:51:42.781
He could've kept
Nathan's taps there.

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.962
You alone?

01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:01.800
You gotta surrender now.
I can't hold them back. They're coming up.

01:52:01.967 --> 01:52:05.220
I'm getting too close, Chris.
I know what went down now.

01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:08.307
Niebaum told me Hellman, Allen
and Argento are involved.

01:52:08.473 --> 01:52:11.476
- You got no proof.
- He does. Niebaum confessed. We all heard.

01:52:11.643 --> 01:52:15.272
They're shooting us one by one
and you fuckers aren't helping us.

01:52:15.439 --> 01:52:19.484
- Are you gonna help us or what?
- Who called for the breach? Beck?

01:52:19.651 --> 01:52:22.487
Yeah, but he says you fired first
and Niebaum was an accident.

01:52:22.654 --> 01:52:24.740
Niebaum was no accident.
He was assassinated.

01:52:24.907 --> 01:52:28.076
He's got three bullets,
center mass. Look.

01:52:39.671 --> 01:52:43.258
Come on, Chris.
You gotta admit something's going on.

01:52:43.425 --> 01:52:46.345
It doesn't matter.
Two cops are dead and you killed one.

01:52:46.511 --> 01:52:50.515
I need to get you and these hostages out
of here before they come in.

01:52:58.482 --> 01:52:59.524
Let's end this, Danny!

01:53:15.207 --> 01:53:18.085
They had to believe I was capable of that.

01:53:18.377 --> 01:53:22.130
There's only one dead cop up here,
killed by the men who tried to set me up.

01:53:23.298 --> 01:53:26.009
Now, I know Nate tapped Hellman
and the others.

01:53:26.176 --> 01:53:29.554
I think those taps are at Niebaum's.
If I get there, I can end this.

01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:33.225
They're gonna kill you. Understand?
You got no way out unless you surrender.

01:53:33.392 --> 01:53:35.644
You gave me a way out
when you shut the heat off.

01:53:35.811 --> 01:53:38.730
Now, you know there's another way
you can help me.

01:53:39.106 --> 01:53:40.691
You were wrong about me.

01:53:42.401 --> 01:53:44.486
What if I'm right about them?

01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:49.366
But what if you're wrong about me?

01:54:04.006 --> 01:54:07.676
Maggie. Uncuff yourself.
Get in the conference room.

01:54:11.263 --> 01:54:12.848
Shit.

01:54:15.058 --> 01:54:18.687
Initiate full breach. Shoot on sight.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.296
Come on, Rudy. Move, move!

01:55:32.928 --> 01:55:35.097
Here, Maggie, use this.

01:55:35.597 --> 01:55:39.017
Markus, split this between
you and Rudy. Wet it.

01:55:40.185 --> 01:55:43.355
You know the drill.
There's gonna be a lot of gas and smoke.

01:55:44.147 --> 01:55:46.024
Let me have those keys.

01:56:00.997 --> 01:56:04.209
Don't be scared.
They're coming to save you in a minute.

01:56:04.376 --> 01:56:05.669
Close the door.

01:56:05.836 --> 01:56:08.296
Down, down, down.
On the ground, now.

01:56:59.764 --> 01:57:01.391
- Move.
- Move now.

01:57:04.853 --> 01:57:06.563
Look out!

01:57:19.576 --> 01:57:21.244
Double up, now! Now, now, now!

01:57:51.983 --> 01:57:54.778
Found the hostages. No sign of Roman.

01:57:54.945 --> 01:57:58.156
Check the elevator shaft,
check every vent, check the basement.

01:57:58.323 --> 01:58:00.909
Come on, get up. Let's go. Let's go!

01:58:04.746 --> 01:58:06.164
We found Scott.

01:58:07.123 --> 01:58:08.625
He's alive.

01:58:34.526 --> 01:58:38.196
You wanna prove your innocence,
here's your chance.

01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:40.657
But you make one wrong move...

01:58:40.824 --> 01:58:45.287
and I'm gonna take you down myself.
Understand?

01:58:48.373 --> 01:58:52.210
All right, you wanna get out of here?
Follow me.

01:58:55.171 --> 01:58:57.549
If he's in here, we'll find him.

01:58:57.882 --> 01:58:59.134
He's not.

01:59:01.428 --> 01:59:02.554
He's gone mobile.

01:59:04.848 --> 01:59:09.185
This is Commander Beck.
I am now back in charge of this operation.

01:59:09.352 --> 01:59:10.395
What are you doing?

01:59:10.562 --> 01:59:13.565
If he's out of the building,
he's no longer in your jurisdiction.

01:59:16.818 --> 01:59:17.944
Dispatch.

01:59:18.194 --> 01:59:21.865
Suspect may have left the scene,
possibly on foot. Alert all units.

01:59:22.365 --> 01:59:24.242
<i>Alerting all units.</i>

01:59:44.763 --> 01:59:47.599
Sorry, lieutenant.
Can we check the trunk?

02:00:33.645 --> 02:00:35.522
Just keep them back there!

02:01:03.425 --> 02:01:07.637
I don't know what the fuck was going on.
A lot of shit happened out there.

02:01:07.804 --> 02:01:09.848
You must have some idea.

02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:14.018
You know something? I would really
like to help, but my lips are sealed.

02:01:14.269 --> 02:01:16.604
Frankly, I don't trust any of you
fucking guys.

02:01:16.813 --> 02:01:20.275
- I'm very disappointed in all of you.
- Maggie.

02:01:20.442 --> 02:01:24.112
You gotta help us out here.
I know what you're feeling.

02:01:24.279 --> 02:01:25.905
I know you sympathize with Danny...

02:01:26.072 --> 02:01:30.118
but we need to stop him
before he does something dangerous.

02:01:30.535 --> 02:01:33.163
You don't want anyone else hurt, do you?

02:01:33.705 --> 02:01:38.042
You know something, you don't tell us,
that's obstruction of justice.

02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:40.170
Wanna go to jail?

02:01:45.049 --> 02:01:46.634
He went to Niebaum's house.

02:01:50.722 --> 02:01:52.724
Why did he go there?

02:01:54.434 --> 02:01:56.227
Maggie?

02:01:58.563 --> 02:02:00.231
Why did he go there?

02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:22.253
There's nothing here.

02:02:24.088 --> 02:02:27.550
Chris. Who did Nate see the night
before he was killed? Did Linda tell you?

02:02:27.717 --> 02:02:30.595
Yeah. He went to see you,
but you weren't at the precinct.

02:02:30.762 --> 02:02:32.597
You're running out of time, Danny.

02:02:34.516 --> 02:02:36.643
- Dispatch, this is Commander Beck.
- Go ahead.

02:02:36.809 --> 02:02:40.605
I need an air unit deployed
to the 1300 block of Addison.

02:02:40.772 --> 02:02:45.193
Have available HBT units meet me
at the corner of Addison and Iroquois.

02:02:45.443 --> 02:02:47.862
I also need an HPT supervisor
to clear the building.

02:02:48.029 --> 02:02:49.197
<i>Copy. Will relay.</i>

02:03:06.422 --> 02:03:08.302
Come on, Danny, there's nothing here.
It's over.

02:03:10.552 --> 02:03:13.471
That's it, I'm taking you in, man.
You had your chance.

02:03:16.766 --> 02:03:20.603
Look, look. Don't screw me now.
You said you were gonna give me time.

02:03:20.770 --> 02:03:24.023
Now, look. I know these are the bastards
that killed Nate.

02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:26.276
Now, all I need...

02:03:26.818 --> 02:03:29.654
is two minutes.
Just two minutes and your radio, all right?

02:03:29.821 --> 02:03:31.406
I can make this work. Come on!

02:03:50.633 --> 02:03:51.968
Hold it right there, Hellman.

02:03:52.135 --> 02:03:54.637
You come down this hallway,
I'll shoot you one by one.

02:03:54.804 --> 02:03:57.265
Danny. Danny Roman.

02:03:57.432 --> 02:04:00.143
Come on, it's all over?

02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:02.228
You'll do a little time.

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.273
Karen will be taken care of, okay?

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:07.525
Nobody gets hurt.

02:04:12.238 --> 02:04:14.949
All right? Come on. Surrender.

02:04:15.116 --> 02:04:16.367
Surrender, my ass.

02:04:16.534 --> 02:04:20.288
I've got two disks with your voices
on them. Nate's taps.

02:04:20.455 --> 02:04:21.831
Come on down the hall!

02:04:21.998 --> 02:04:25.001
I got 15 shots here. That's five apiece.

02:04:36.095 --> 02:04:39.057
Whatever you're trying
to pull, Roman, it's not gonna work.

02:04:39.223 --> 02:04:42.060
Stop this shit and come out
before someone gets killed.

02:04:42.226 --> 02:04:46.397
Look, I know somebody else was in charge.
You couldn't have pulled this off yourself.

02:04:46.564 --> 02:04:49.567
Danny, man, you got this all wrong.

02:04:49.734 --> 02:04:53.363
No, I got it right.
Is that why you sound so nervous, Argento?

02:04:53.905 --> 02:04:57.075
- You killed Niebaum and Nate?
- Danny, that's absurd!

02:04:58.201 --> 02:05:00.078
Come on.
You know your guys out there...

02:05:00.244 --> 02:05:03.373
gonna leave you hanging for murder one
while they plea down.

02:05:03.748 --> 02:05:06.376
Make a deal for yourself
while you still can, Argento.

02:05:07.251 --> 02:05:10.922
Danny, I swear to you
we don't know what you're talking about.

02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:12.965
All right, play dumb.

02:05:13.132 --> 02:05:15.677
How could you dumb fucks
let somebody get you on tape?

02:05:18.471 --> 02:05:22.100
Come on. Listen to you.
Why don't you stop this shit and come out?

02:05:22.266 --> 02:05:27.438
All right, keep talking, asshole.
You've already done everything wrong.

02:05:27.605 --> 02:05:31.442
You left me alive, me against you,
and I won.

02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:35.738
Hey, fuck you? Fuck you!

02:05:35.905 --> 02:05:40.243
Let me tell you: I don't give a fuck
what kind of evidence you got. Know why?

02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:42.970
Because you're not gonna make it
out of here alive, motherfucker!

02:05:45.748 --> 02:05:47.458
Stand down.

02:05:49.919 --> 02:05:53.798
Put your weapons down
and move your asses out of here now.

02:05:57.510 --> 02:06:01.973
- Frost?
- Yeah. Danny, it's me, Frost.

02:06:03.641 --> 02:06:07.019
Yeah, Danny, I'm ordering them off.
I'm locking them out now.

02:06:07.186 --> 02:06:09.397
It's just you and me, buddy.

02:06:10.565 --> 02:06:11.774
You hear that, Danny?

02:06:12.775 --> 02:06:14.235
They're gone.

02:06:15.445 --> 02:06:17.155
Listen, Danny...

02:06:17.947 --> 02:06:19.490
I know you're scared.

02:06:20.408 --> 02:06:21.951
I know you don't trust anyone.

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:26.247
A lot of shit went down.

02:06:26.414 --> 02:06:28.624
I don't even understand some of it myself.

02:06:29.876 --> 02:06:32.879
Come on out, Danny.
You have my support.

02:06:33.045 --> 02:06:37.008
Any evidence you have,
let's just bring it out there.

02:06:37.383 --> 02:06:39.844
Hey, Frost. Come on.

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.183
What the hell are you doing here, Sabian?

02:06:45.433 --> 02:06:48.436
- Finishing what you started.
- What are you talking about?

02:06:48.603 --> 02:06:50.688
Roman is going outwith me.

02:06:50.855 --> 02:06:54.025
No one else. Alone.
We can't trust anyone else.

02:06:56.778 --> 02:06:58.446
Yeah, that's right.

02:06:59.363 --> 02:07:01.657
We don't know who to trust, do we?

02:07:05.661 --> 02:07:07.330
Do you like Westerns, Frost?

02:07:08.873 --> 02:07:11.667
What's the fuck is that supposed to mean?

02:07:12.043 --> 02:07:14.712
I like Westerns.
I can't get enough of them.

02:07:14.879 --> 02:07:16.130
Watch them all the time.

02:07:16.297 --> 02:07:19.383
My favorites have always been
where the hero dies at the end.

02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:25.056
- You remember Shane, Danny?
- What?

02:07:25.223 --> 02:07:28.226
I think you're right.
Shane died at the end.

02:07:37.151 --> 02:07:41.572
So you killed Nathan, I killed Danny...

02:07:44.909 --> 02:07:47.912
and now my hands
are just as dirty as yours...

02:07:48.079 --> 02:07:50.248
only I still have the evidence...

02:07:50.414 --> 02:07:54.085
so I'd say I'm in a very good position
to negotiate.

02:07:54.836 --> 02:07:56.462
So you wanna deal?

02:07:57.255 --> 02:07:58.756
You deal with me.

02:08:00.258 --> 02:08:04.095
There's a time limit on these negotiations
because we're about to be interrupted...

02:08:04.262 --> 02:08:06.556
so let's do this quickly. I want in.

02:08:06.722 --> 02:08:09.934
Sixty percent of everything you've taken.

02:08:15.273 --> 02:08:17.775
I can't give you what I don't have.

02:08:18.776 --> 02:08:21.404
You see, I spent a lot of my take.

02:08:22.113 --> 02:08:24.907
I don't know how much Allen,
Hellman and Argento have.

02:08:25.074 --> 02:08:27.118
We used a lot of it to set Roman up.

02:08:27.285 --> 02:08:31.122
All right.
Fifty percent of what you don't have.

02:08:31.998 --> 02:08:33.958
- Thirty percent.
- Forty-five.

02:08:36.294 --> 02:08:37.420
Thirty-five.

02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:40.965
You should've been a negotiator.

02:08:44.218 --> 02:08:45.803
Right.

02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:47.805
I want all the evidence destroyed.

02:08:49.181 --> 02:08:50.600
Deal.

02:08:53.394 --> 02:08:54.645
This is everything?

02:08:58.232 --> 02:08:59.275
What do you think?

02:09:25.343 --> 02:09:27.511
Danny Roman's been shot.

02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:35.478
He's dead.

02:09:35.686 --> 02:09:37.521
<i>Let's get you some help.</i>

02:09:39.357 --> 02:09:41.484
<i>Come on. Here we go.</i>

02:09:42.526 --> 02:09:44.278
<i>That's it. Come on.</i>

02:09:44.445 --> 02:09:46.280
<i>There you go.</i>

02:10:00.711 --> 02:10:03.547
<i>We got an officer down in here!</i>

02:10:17.019 --> 02:10:18.729
You have the right to remain silent.

02:10:20.398 --> 02:10:22.483
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

02:10:22.650 --> 02:10:25.069
anything you say
can be used against you...

02:10:25.236 --> 02:10:26.904
No, no, no...

02:10:55.433 --> 02:10:58.019
You're not gonna get off that easy.

02:11:19.874 --> 02:11:21.917
Karen, wait.

02:12:14.595 --> 02:12:18.390
- Get some help here.
- We got an injured cop here.

02:13:01.225 --> 02:13:02.226
Give me your hand.

02:13:05.896 --> 02:13:08.065
Danny, you know what I thought.

02:13:08.399 --> 02:13:09.817
I'm sorry.

02:13:22.037 --> 02:13:23.080
Sorry about that.

02:13:25.916 --> 02:13:27.001
Nice bluff, Chris.

02:13:27.918 --> 02:13:28.919
Well, it worked.

02:13:30.296 --> 02:13:33.007
Anyway, I figured you'd rather be shot
by me than by him.

02:13:33.174 --> 02:13:34.717
Yeah.

02:13:34.884 --> 02:13:37.344
Here's the one demand I didn't meet yet.

02:13:41.807 --> 02:13:44.018
Nice talking to you, lieutenant.

02:13:47.104 --> 02:13:48.355
Thanks.

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:51.275
Let's get him out of here.

02:13:52.943 --> 02:13:55.446
Eagle, make sure this location is secured.

02:13:55.613 --> 02:13:59.617
I want this street cleared, right now!
Got an ambulance coming through here.

02:13:59.783 --> 02:14:00.951
Move it!
