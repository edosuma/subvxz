01:03.772 --> 01:05.648
Watch, okay?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.192
Look.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.736
That's it. Let's do the wave!

01:12.280 --> 01:15.825
Geez. Who does that these days?

01:16.451 --> 01:17.911
This is so annoying.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.788
Come on. Let's go.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.165
Everyone drink. Drink.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.250
Newbie. With two hands.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.128
Okay. I love you.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.296
-I love you!
-I love you!

01:28.379 --> 01:29.756
Bottoms up!

01:29.839 --> 01:30.799
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

01:34.427 --> 01:37.263
Okay. Next.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.640
Okay.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.018
Life is so sad.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.730
I don't know why it's so sad.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.110
I really didn't know
I would live like this.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.072
I thought I would have a decent life.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.035
Wait right here. I'll be right back.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.120
Okay.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.301
OP ENTERTAINMENT
JIN-MYUNG YOON

02:21.307 --> 02:22.892
It's 8,000 won.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.107
How can we make it to work tomorrow?

02:29.315 --> 02:31.276
Mr. Yoon must really not want to go home.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.194
Then why did he get married?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.321
I really want to take a day off.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.365
You'll have to quit first.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.449
It's 16,000 won.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.659
MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TEAM

02:43.037 --> 02:44.289
Thank you.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.713
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.261
-Text me when you get home.
-Okay.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.682
-Take her home safely, please.
-Okay.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.589
EPISODE 4
TO SURVIVE #TheSeflishGene

04:05.245 --> 04:07.288
Stop the Misconduct!

04:30.603 --> 04:33.022
-What's with her?
-She got a wedding invitation.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.023
Who's getting married?

04:34.899 --> 04:36.818
A classmate from grade school?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.903
-First love?
-No, it's a girl.

04:40.905 --> 04:41.948
Then why is she like that?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.370
I haven't even done it once,

04:47.954 --> 04:49.706
but someone my age

04:50.081 --> 04:53.042
can do it every day... Officially.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.586
I'm so far behind.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.797
Seriously.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.426
-Should I get you depressed, too?
-What?

05:01.801 --> 05:05.263
My friend met her husband in college.
He's her first love.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.306
So what?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.269
Eun-jae has changed.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.272
She used to be fun to tease.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.108
Nothing is going my way.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.780
What?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.492
We're having a party.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.330
So what?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.458
Stupid. Her boyfriend will be there, too.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.501
It's ex-boyfriend.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.920
What do I do?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.756
Do I go or not?

05:40.339 --> 05:42.383
Go. It's not like you committed a crime.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.844
Go and have fun. Eat and drink.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.430
Don't go. You'll just be uncomfortable.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.434
He'll be there. Why can't you go?

05:51.517 --> 05:54.145
Why does the girl always
have to stay away after a breakup?

05:54.228 --> 05:56.773
I don't like that. Don't you do it.

05:58.566 --> 06:01.194
You have no choice.
That's how the world is.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.529
Everyone knows you dated and broke up.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.948
You'll just make others uncomfortable.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.117
Uncomfortable about what?

06:08.242 --> 06:10.703
Go. Speak on the microphone,

06:11.079 --> 06:15.541
"I'm single now. Guys, line up."

06:18.336 --> 06:19.879
I shouldn't go.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.010
What's with you?

06:26.094 --> 06:28.721
Jin-myung's company, Oh and Park...

06:29.347 --> 06:31.015
Is it the Oh and Park?

06:33.851 --> 06:37.021
-They're coming!
-They're here!

06:37.897 --> 06:39.065
They're here!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.306
Why are you following me?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.187
Excuse me.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.840
Oh and Park is...

07:45.923 --> 07:50.553
That's right. The 12 Zodiacs,
the Fifth Column, Hot Place!

07:53.389 --> 07:55.391
Awesome. They're here.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.559
Really?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.019
-Work.
-Oh, my gosh.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.897
-Hello.
-Hi.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.151
This is the Management Support team.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.237
-Mr. Cho, the manager.
-Hello. It's nice to meet you.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.739
Introduce yourselves.

08:09.822 --> 08:10.740
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.033
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.701
-Come here.
-Yes, ma'am.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.411
-Talk to them.
-Yes, ma'am.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.747
-Can we take a picture?
-Sure.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.128
One, two, three.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.506
May I get your autograph?

08:26.589 --> 08:28.257
Mine, too. Mine.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.550
Thank you.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.053
-Oh, my gosh.
-Three.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.014
ASGARD BUSINESS EXPENSES ANALYSIS

08:35.097 --> 08:37.600
RECORDED A LOSS FOR THREE YEARS
SINCE THEIR DEBUT

08:37.683 --> 08:41.062
They said everyone responded like I did
when Jin-myung got the job.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.941
But the only singers Jin-myung knows
are H.O.T. and Sechs Kies.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.108
Isn't that so funny?

08:47.443 --> 08:48.569
You said she was old.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.072
Jin-myung is only 29.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.659
-That means she's a granny.
-Even my mom knows the Fifth Column.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.996
Ji-won is a die-hard Fifth Column fan...

08:59.080 --> 09:01.832
-Ji-won?
-You know, the one who talks a lot.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.336
Oh, that girl who lies all the time?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.175
Since when did you guys get so close?

09:12.051 --> 09:14.470
Well, it's not like we're close,
but we get along.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.517
What about that girl Eun-jae?
Do you get along with her, too?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.561
There's no reason not to.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.815
Come to think of it,
you and Eun-jae are alike.

09:26.023 --> 09:26.857
How?

09:26.941 --> 09:30.403
You look like you would only read
love stories, but read Junji Ito.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.949
Do you know what game Eun-jae plays now?
The arms and...

09:35.032 --> 09:36.284
Enough already!

09:37.702 --> 09:39.662
All you talk about are your housemates.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.289
Lucky you, you have so many friends.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.916
You used to hate their guts.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.669
You said they were too gloomy,
they talked too much, and they're mean!

09:46.877 --> 09:48.254
Why did you move in there?

09:48.879 --> 09:51.048
You don't talk about that letter anymore.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.175
What's wrong with you lately?

09:53.259 --> 09:56.679
You're really annoying. I can't stand you!

10:06.105 --> 10:09.275
YEONNAM-RO 22

10:20.202 --> 10:21.245
Password.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.384
PHARMACY

10:35.468 --> 10:38.012
PHARMACY

11:26.560 --> 11:29.355
That felt great...

11:42.493 --> 11:43.494
Oh, my gosh!

11:44.453 --> 11:45.287
Mommy!

11:46.455 --> 11:48.874
What was that? Did that come from here?

11:49.083 --> 11:49.959
It sounded like a guy.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.547
-Did you just scream?
-It was a guy.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
What the heck? Who is that?
Did you bring a guy home?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.432
No.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.601
-Then why is he here?
-Call the cops.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.811
Call the cops.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.064
Pervert!

12:12.148 --> 12:13.190
Get dressed!

12:13.274 --> 12:14.442
He must have been naked.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.786
-Who are you?
-I'm the owner...

12:25.870 --> 12:28.831
-Don't lie.
-The owner's agent.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.917
Agent?

12:32.501 --> 12:34.086
Didn't you hear I was coming?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.422
My great-aunt said she would tell you.

12:36.505 --> 12:40.301
She said someone was coming,
but we didn't expect a young guy.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.178
Ask him why he's up here.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.724
My father said it was the second floor.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.393
I'll show you the text.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.564
Look. See? He said second floor.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.442
Son, it's Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22,
2nd floor.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.028
The owner's place is downstairs.

13:00.779 --> 13:04.116
There must have been a mistake.
Let me call my dad.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.250
Hi, Dad. You made a mistake
in your text, didn't you?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.544
I came into the wrong place!

13:16.462 --> 13:19.924
-But you're really calm.
-It's your fault!

13:20.007 --> 13:21.091
You're right.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.093
Just like General Cho.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.515
Anyway, what was he doing
when you came home?

13:59.588 --> 14:02.007
-Your name is Hoon?
-Yes.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.344
Jin-myung. The owner's agent.

14:07.054 --> 14:07.888
Hello.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.059
-Ms. Ha's nephew?
-Yes.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.397
-I expected someone older.
-Exactly.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.732
Great-nephew. You can sit.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.112
You have a short name.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.240
We have so many with short names.
Hoon, Eun.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.494
No. My name is Jang-hoon.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.121
What's your family name?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.542
-Seo.
-Seo?

14:37.585 --> 14:39.378
Jang-hoon Seo?

14:42.006 --> 14:43.424
Jang-hoon Seo?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.051
Yes, that Jang-hoon Seo.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.346
My name doesn't suit me, right?

14:51.098 --> 14:54.727
It's okay. I have a cousin
named Hye-kyo Song.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.353
Hye-kyo Song.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.856
What's wrong?

14:59.773 --> 15:00.858
Do you feel sick?

15:11.702 --> 15:13.037
What's wrong with her?

15:13.829 --> 15:16.540
Congratulations. You're three months...

15:19.001 --> 15:21.378
I'll go now. Good night.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.679
-A guy?
-Yes. He's 22.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.307
He took time off to go to the army.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.394
Are you okay?
Your housemates seem thoughtless.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.064
They know your situation.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.274
How could they bring a guy into the house?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.818
She can't avoid guys forever.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.363
You have to get used to it
little by little.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.324
Worry about yourself. The employment...

15:50.407 --> 15:51.408
Let's go somewhere else.

15:52.159 --> 15:55.871
-Why?
-Just because. Let's go.

15:55.955 --> 15:56.956
Sure.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.630
Okay. I'm coming.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.299
Okay. I'll be there soon.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.899
Were you scared because it was an alley
or because it was dark?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.067
Both.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.861
Big streets are okay?

17:09.611 --> 17:10.696
They're better.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.365
At least, I rode the bus by myself.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.285
I'll make you sweet and spicy pork...

17:20.539 --> 17:21.790
What are you doing in here?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.962
Were you watching these things again?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.840
You sinner, you.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.931
She's throwing up again.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.392
General Cho, go see a doctor.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.397
Maybe she's sick.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.483
Do something about that.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.694
Freeze.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.158
What the...

18:05.584 --> 18:06.627
What...

18:07.503 --> 18:08.837
Damn it.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.094
Excuse me.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.763
Lend me your phone.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.266
You know me, right? Heimdallr.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.185
I'm sorry?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.812
The second vocalist of Asgard.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.564
We work at the same company.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.569
I'm in Management, so...

18:32.653 --> 18:33.904
Seriously.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.036
-Be quick and give it back.
-Okay. Thanks.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.333
Where are you?

18:48.085 --> 18:50.671
I'm not in the car.
How many times is this already?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.424
How can I ride the bus
with stage makeup on?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.843
Come get me.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.680
Who told you to be so slow?
We'll be late if I turn back.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.599
Cab fare? Dream on.

19:03.142 --> 19:07.104
Then just stay. No one knows
whether there are six of you or seven.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.939
What?

19:09.439 --> 19:12.442
No. I'll go. Wait for me.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.528
Be there soon. Okay.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.282
Wait until we make it big.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.872
Lend me 100,000 won.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.791
-No.
-We work at the same company.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.793
I don't know you.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.229
-Don't follow me.
-I'm going to the bus stop.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.485
Look.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.332
Tell them not to take pictures.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.751
-Me?
-Yes.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.711
Why?

20:14.129 --> 20:16.256
You should protect your company's artist.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.009
I don't know who you are.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.720
Seriously.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.182
Wait until we make it big.
I'll talk about this on talk shows.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.392
I don't care.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.436
Don't talk to me.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.232
Hey.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.651
Do you know this movie?

21:19.111 --> 21:20.988
-Eternal Sunshine.
-That's right.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.537
Eternal Sunshine. What is it about?

21:31.498 --> 21:33.959
It's about a guy
who has his memories erased.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.046
A guy lost his love.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.509
Those memories were too painful,
so he had them erased.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.429
But memories of her remained
in his subconscious.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.932
So he meets her again,

21:49.016 --> 21:51.685
falls in love and breaks up?

21:51.768 --> 21:54.021
I think it was something like that. Right?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.606
Yes, I think it was something like that.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.442
I watched it so long ago.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.236
A guy who is in pain...

22:02.029 --> 22:04.906
because of the love he lost?

22:10.787 --> 22:11.621
What?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.169
Why? Did your ex post something
on social media?

22:17.252 --> 22:18.462
That he liked that movie?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.214
-No.
-Yes, he did.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.508
No.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.053
His profile pic.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.307
How did you know?

22:30.432 --> 22:32.559
I did it all before.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.436
Really? You did that, too?

22:34.519 --> 22:38.190
Of course. That was how I started
and ended my days.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.609
Didn't you break up with your boyfriend?

22:43.779 --> 22:44.613
I did.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.740
Then why did you look at it?

22:46.948 --> 22:50.285
Well... just.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.454
What are you, a stalker?

22:53.705 --> 22:56.291
Hey. All I did was
check his social media page.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.251
Yeah, that's too harsh.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.463
It's just a process in moving on.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.508
-Right?
-Right. But...

23:04.591 --> 23:05.717
Jin-myung!

23:06.676 --> 23:08.678
-It's Oh and Park?
-Yes.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.889
-Did you see The Fifth Column?
-No.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.182
What about Hot Place?

23:12.641 --> 23:15.102
No. I did see some tall kids today, but...

23:15.185 --> 23:16.853
What did they look like? No.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.105
How many of them were there?

23:18.188 --> 23:20.607
If five, it was Fifth Column,
and Hot Place if there were six.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.275
I did see Asgard though.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.236
As...

23:28.115 --> 23:30.367
-What's that?
-You don't know Heimdallr?

23:31.451 --> 23:32.661
Never mind.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.747
Jin-myung. What did they look like?

23:35.831 --> 23:37.332
Can't you take me?

23:37.415 --> 23:40.043
Anyway, how do you see private posts?

23:40.127 --> 23:42.129
-You can't.
-I can't?

23:43.588 --> 23:44.589
Hold on.

23:45.465 --> 23:49.219
There is a way to click through
to get to it.

23:51.138 --> 23:51.972
Give me that.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.392
-See how you hit "Like" here?
-Yes.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.893
Then click here...

23:56.977 --> 23:59.688
We've looked into the history

23:59.771 --> 24:02.190
and the development
of psychological evaluations.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.026
Now, we'll look into

24:05.110 --> 24:06.945
why it is necessary,

24:07.028 --> 24:09.990
and how to analyze
results of the evaluations.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.577
A guy lost his love.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.997
Those memories were too painful,
so he had them erased.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.624
But memories of her remained
in his subconscious.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.961
So he meets her again,

24:23.044 --> 24:25.297
falls in love and breaks up?

24:29.217 --> 24:31.636
That will be all for today.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.555
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.310
Hey.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.021
Are you going to the party tonight?

24:43.773 --> 24:45.901
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.244
-How tall are you?
-Me? I'm 187cm.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.289
You're so tall that I thought
you were an athlete.

24:59.372 --> 25:02.918
-Whatever.
-Don't people say you look like someone?

25:03.210 --> 25:06.296
Me? Who do I look like?

25:06.713 --> 25:07.756
Woo-sung Jung?

25:10.175 --> 25:13.178
-Seriously.
-Just kidding. I know.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.309
Hey.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.978
Is it that funny that I got disciplined?

25:25.565 --> 25:26.566
Sorry.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.195
Okay, okay! Let's all quiet down!

25:30.278 --> 25:31.529
-Quiet!
-Quiet!

25:31.613 --> 25:34.824
Let's have lots of fun now.

25:34.908 --> 25:35.742
Applause.

25:39.579 --> 25:40.538
Next.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.623
Okay.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.221
-Drink!
-Drink!

25:56.304 --> 25:57.722
Dark knight, please.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.643
-Dark knight!
-Dark knight!

26:01.726 --> 26:02.769
Jong-yeoul.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.150
Forget it. Next game.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.694
-Love shot!
-Love shot!

26:12.821 --> 26:13.905
Nice.

26:14.990 --> 26:15.907
Go.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.284
-One.
-Two.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.368
Three.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.665
Stop. Let's forget the games.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.209
Let's sing.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.461
-Jong-yeoul!
-Jong-yeoul!

26:28.545 --> 26:29.462
"OLD LOVE"

26:32.924 --> 26:36.219
I lingered

26:36.303 --> 26:40.223
And cried alone

26:40.307 --> 26:42.475
The past

26:42.559 --> 26:45.353
The past? It's the past for me, too.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.022
It's way past.

26:47.772 --> 26:51.568
Under the empty sky

26:51.651 --> 26:55.572
The trembling lips

26:55.655 --> 26:59.409
My old love

26:59.492 --> 27:00.910
Yes, it's your old love.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.371
It's so old, I can't even remember.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.750
The cold wind blows

27:06.833 --> 27:10.503
And shifts my jacket

27:10.587 --> 27:14.716
I regret it, I'm angry

27:14.799 --> 27:16.760
And I begin to cry

27:16.843 --> 27:17.886
Angry?

27:18.511 --> 27:20.263
Angry about what?

27:21.097 --> 27:22.349
What did I do wrong?

27:22.432 --> 27:25.643
Everything was a lie

27:26.478 --> 27:32.275
Now, if I miss something

27:32.359 --> 27:35.070
I'll let myself miss it

27:35.153 --> 27:41.785
There are times when you are sick of love

27:41.868 --> 27:42.952
Sick of it?

27:43.578 --> 27:46.539
Then why did you put that
as your profile pic?

27:55.048 --> 27:58.218
Nothing happened to me

27:58.301 --> 28:00.678
We never knew each other

28:00.762 --> 28:07.268
Can't you just let me go?

28:08.812 --> 28:13.942
Don't cling onto me

28:15.777 --> 28:21.157
Don't come back to me again

28:23.159 --> 28:28.039
You'll end up being hurt

28:28.832 --> 28:32.460
Take it away

28:32.544 --> 28:36.423
Your blind love

28:36.506 --> 28:42.303
You know it's nothing but obsession

28:42.387 --> 28:46.307
Please erase

28:46.683 --> 28:49.310
That dreadful love

28:49.394 --> 28:51.020
Doesn't she usually sing well?

28:51.479 --> 28:52.397
Really?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.526
Until the final moment

28:56.609 --> 28:59.154
I love you

29:09.998 --> 29:11.791
-I'm fine.
-Let's go.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.710
-Come on.
-What?

29:13.793 --> 29:16.588
-Hey.
-What is it?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.923
-Seriously.
-What?

29:19.007 --> 29:20.133
Walk slowly.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.427
-Seriously.
-Wake up, will you?

29:22.510 --> 29:23.970
-I'm going home.
-Please.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.389
-Please go home.
-Why is she always like this?

29:26.473 --> 29:28.016
Good night.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.058
-Bye.
-You, too.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.643
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.854
-See you next week.
-Bye.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.064
-Bye.
-Thank you.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.484
-I'm so tired. Bye.
-Later.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.402
-Bye.
-Night.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.361
-Bye
-See you tomorrow.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.279
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:41.362 --> 29:42.405
See you tomorrow.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.543
Are you okay?

30:00.632 --> 30:01.633
Yes.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.513
Wait here. I'll get my bag.

30:08.890 --> 30:09.891
Why?

30:11.726 --> 30:14.854
What? To take you home.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.444
Get home safely.

30:23.112 --> 30:23.947
Okay.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.244
You look pretty!

31:58.458 --> 31:59.918
Married woman!

32:06.841 --> 32:09.010
Nice. The bride's dance.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.223
Ma'am. Please stand up.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.809
Let's give her a hand. Nice.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.691
You're awesome!

32:26.110 --> 32:28.780
Okay. Smile for me.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.366
One, two, three! Smile!

32:31.449 --> 32:34.577
Jin-ah's dream was to be a dancer
when she was in grade school.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.246
She did? Was she a good dancer?

32:37.330 --> 32:40.541
She was good at dancing,
running, anything physical.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.335
Her dream was to be the perfect wife.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.922
Really? Me?

32:46.005 --> 32:49.133
Yeah, in fifth grade.
I remember cracking up so much.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.135
How do you remember all of that?

32:51.636 --> 32:52.887
What was mine?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.223
I think you wanted to work
for a corporation.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.810
Hey, do you know Hyo-jin Moon?

32:58.893 --> 33:01.104
Hyo-jin Moon?
Did she go to our grade school?

33:01.187 --> 33:04.232
Yeah, I think she was in my class
in the third grade.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.733
I don't know.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.696
Friends of the bride and groom,
please come up.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.906
They want us. Let's go.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.242
Please come up.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.786
Why did you ask about Hyo-jin Moon?

33:16.911 --> 33:20.540
Just because. I have a picture with her,
but I couldn't remember her.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.749
Hyo-jin Moon...

33:21.833 --> 33:25.420
Wasn't she the one who used to win
essay contests?

33:25.503 --> 33:27.588
That was Ho-joon Jung.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.632
-They sound nothing alike.
-No clue.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.343
Okay, look here. Squeeze in.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.471
Okay, good. Short people, step down.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.182
You. Poodle hair.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.392
Step down.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.520
Okay, nice.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.772
I checked our album,
and there was no Hyo-jin Moon.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.191
-Who?
-This girl named Hyo-jin Moon.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.277
You look pretty today.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.029
-Thanks.
-It's so not you.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.949
But what about Hyo-jin?

33:55.658 --> 33:56.909
Do you know her?

33:56.993 --> 33:59.787
Of course. Didn't she transfer
after summer vacation during third grade?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.414
Okay, here we go!

34:01.497 --> 34:04.709
Smile! One, two, three!

34:04.792 --> 34:06.502
Click! Okay. One more.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.754
Why did she transfer?

34:10.798 --> 34:11.924
Bride! Face forward!

34:12.008 --> 34:15.136
Okay! One, two, three. Click.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.430
Okay, one more.

34:21.142 --> 34:24.228
Okay, here we go. Last one.
One, two, three!

34:24.312 --> 34:25.396
Click.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.915
YE-JI AHN

34:48.544 --> 34:52.298
Are you still mad?

35:07.688 --> 35:08.523
Excuse me.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.154
Shoot.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.001
Why are you empty-handed?

35:45.685 --> 35:46.978
Open the door.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.654
You left these...

36:08.583 --> 36:09.917
I'll help you.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.924
You know...

36:18.801 --> 36:20.803
I heard roughly from my dad
about the person

36:21.888 --> 36:24.265
who was assaulted by her boyfriend.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.518
He said she's afraid of guys
because of that,

36:28.019 --> 36:29.270
and to be extra careful.

36:30.688 --> 36:33.941
But I had to make that mistake
on my first day here.

36:34.775 --> 36:39.280
I'm very worried that the symptoms
may get worse because of me.

36:42.408 --> 36:46.370
When she threw up,
I wondered what was wrong with her,

36:46.871 --> 36:49.707
but I feel like
it's because she was so shocked.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.375
What?

36:52.752 --> 36:54.128
She didn't tell you?

36:55.004 --> 36:56.297
Well, the thing is...

36:56.589 --> 36:59.175
I wasn't thinking,
and I stepped out of the shower,

36:59.759 --> 37:02.511
and she had to be there
and saw everything.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.348
So I was wondering what I should do.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.100
Should I not talk to her at all?

37:08.684 --> 37:11.312
Or is it okay to say hi
when I see her pass?

37:12.355 --> 37:13.773
What should I do?

37:20.404 --> 37:22.531
-Thank you.
-Pardon?

37:23.824 --> 37:25.576
For being thoughtful.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.037
No. I'm the one who made a mistake.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.456
I should make up for it.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.868
Last time...

38:54.540 --> 38:57.376
Why did you do that last time?

38:58.627 --> 38:59.462
Sorry?

39:01.213 --> 39:02.590
Last time,

39:03.299 --> 39:07.303
when I was talking with my friends
over there,

39:08.387 --> 39:12.099
why did you suddenly drag me out?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.188
They were your friends?

39:21.567 --> 39:23.694
-I'm sorry.
-No.

39:24.779 --> 39:28.199
I wasn't asking for an apology.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.495
I just wanted to know why you did it...

39:36.374 --> 39:37.583
I thought...

39:38.918 --> 39:40.878
they weren't your friends.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.047
I thought they were bullying you.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.259
Why did you think of it that way?

39:49.678 --> 39:50.763
Well...

39:52.098 --> 39:53.224
The look on their faces.

39:54.308 --> 39:58.437
I was bullied when I was in grade school
and junior high,

39:58.938 --> 40:01.565
and that's how the kids looked
when they bullied me.

40:04.860 --> 40:05.903
I misjudged...

40:07.446 --> 40:09.490
You didn't misjudge.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.158
You were right.

40:12.701 --> 40:16.288
I felt terrible back then.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.708
Right? You did, right?

40:21.085 --> 40:22.420
I thought so.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.467
It's nothing to laugh about.

40:36.642 --> 40:39.270
Anyway, I was grateful.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.526
Sure.

41:04.378 --> 41:07.548
What do you do here alone all the time?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.427
I've seen you while walking by,

41:12.511 --> 41:14.597
and you're always doing something alone.

41:17.349 --> 41:20.019
This is an app that I'm programming.

41:20.102 --> 41:21.770
It keeps getting errors.

41:23.272 --> 41:27.359
It's sort of like a mobile lie detector.

41:27.443 --> 41:30.279
Most lie detectors measure pulse...

41:30.362 --> 41:31.530
Who is that?

41:31.614 --> 41:34.533
But this one can do it
using just the voice.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.118
If I save my normal voice...

41:36.202 --> 41:39.246
Sorry. Later. My friends are here.

41:40.039 --> 41:42.333
-Later?
-Yes.

41:44.793 --> 41:45.794
Okay.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.634
Thank you.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.262
Sure.

42:01.393 --> 42:04.063
I guess Ye-eun is getting a new boyfriend.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.981
Already?

42:06.106 --> 42:09.068
-Hey. It's been over a year.
-Still.

42:09.568 --> 42:11.445
You're overly worried.

42:11.862 --> 42:15.616
She's tougher than she looks.
She'll get back up on her own.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.076
Don't be overprotective.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.078
-What?
-Who was that?

42:19.662 --> 42:21.539
No one. Nothing much. Let's go.

42:24.625 --> 42:27.086
-He's coming after you.
-Excuse me!

42:28.128 --> 42:28.963
Your number.

42:34.468 --> 42:36.345
I need your number to talk later.

42:41.767 --> 42:42.810
Give it.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.439
It's 010...

43:10.254 --> 43:12.756
It's good. It's good for your first time.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.385
It shouldn't be
"good for your first time," but just good.

43:17.303 --> 43:19.888
It's okay. That's why
you have the intern stage.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.307
You can learn one by one.

43:21.849 --> 43:25.060
Some things are not meant to be.
If hard work is everything,

43:25.227 --> 43:28.022
I'd be Yuna Kim, you could be
Tae-hwan Park, and...

43:30.024 --> 43:31.442
I was talking to myself.

43:31.984 --> 43:32.901
Continue.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.324
Let's continue in ten minutes.

43:42.578 --> 43:43.579
Come with me.

43:44.830 --> 43:45.956
What?

43:56.258 --> 43:57.134
Stop coming here.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.804
I have nowhere to go. Outside is so...

44:01.263 --> 44:02.097
hot.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.599
Aren't you getting job?

44:04.933 --> 44:05.768
I don't want to.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.646
If not? You want to be unemployed?

44:10.272 --> 44:13.108
-Should I just get married?
-Will someone take you?

44:13.192 --> 44:14.902
-Can you...
-Shut up.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.992
How did it go at the wedding?

44:22.076 --> 44:23.952
You said you would find your lost memory.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.664
Oh, that?

44:26.747 --> 44:29.416
Didn't she transfer
after summer vacation during third grade?

44:29.917 --> 44:31.210
Why did she transfer?

44:31.293 --> 44:34.213
Don't you remember?
There was a weird rumor.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.341
The art teacher said
she drew something weird.

44:38.133 --> 44:39.093
A weird drawing?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.389
A picture of her naked.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.017
Well...

44:47.601 --> 44:50.270
She transferred during third grade.
That must be why I don't remember.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.480
That's all?

44:53.232 --> 44:54.441
Pretty much.

44:56.902 --> 44:59.738
Then you're done. You can just study now.

44:59.905 --> 45:00.739
Don't come anymore.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.201
Hey.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.126
Meanie.

45:15.629 --> 45:19.091
Last time,
we discussed the order and stages

45:19.174 --> 45:21.635
of second languages, right?

45:22.469 --> 45:24.221
-Answer, will you?
-Yes.

45:24.304 --> 45:25.973
Okay, this time,

45:26.056 --> 45:29.685
we'll look into one of the many hypotheses
on second languages.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.728
Input Hypothesis in particular.

46:27.951 --> 46:31.038
-Seriously. Come on.
-What?

46:34.374 --> 46:37.377
You're ignoring me.
Why are you doing that?

46:38.253 --> 46:39.505
I did no such thing.

46:41.757 --> 46:46.094
You're doing it now, too. You keep
looking away while I'm talking to you.

46:46.678 --> 46:47.930
What did I do?

46:50.098 --> 46:52.518
You weren't even the one
assaulted by your boyfriend.

46:52.684 --> 46:54.353
I thought that's what it was.

46:54.770 --> 46:57.147
You're confusing me.
Why are you being this way?

46:58.106 --> 47:00.317
Shoot. What?

47:01.276 --> 47:03.862
It's because I'm upset about
seeing what I saw.

47:03.987 --> 47:07.115
Do you think I wanted to show you
what you saw?

47:07.199 --> 47:10.327
Why are you so upset?
I should be more upset.

47:12.704 --> 47:14.957
Why do you keep looking?

47:15.624 --> 47:16.959
I didn't look.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.587
You're such a pervert. Hey you.

47:21.672 --> 47:22.881
You keep picturing it, right?

47:23.632 --> 47:26.009
I do not. It's so gross. Why would I?

47:26.093 --> 47:27.219
Gross?

47:27.886 --> 47:29.596
They all look like...

47:29.680 --> 47:32.975
Enough already. Stop. Seriously.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.477
This is driving me nuts.

47:49.616 --> 47:50.742
Why that...

47:51.243 --> 47:53.412
Hey, miss. Where do you live?

47:53.996 --> 47:56.373
You can't sit here. You need to go home.

47:56.456 --> 47:58.292
-Leave me alone.
-Ye-ji!

47:58.375 --> 47:59.585
What?

48:03.046 --> 48:05.757
-What? Do you know her?
-You witch!

48:05.841 --> 48:07.968
-What are you doing here?
-You witch.

48:08.802 --> 48:12.514
You're the worst, you witch.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.808
Witch.

48:14.891 --> 48:16.059
Did you do something wrong?

48:16.977 --> 48:19.354
Are you watching a show? Just get inside.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.107
Hey. Get up.

48:22.482 --> 48:25.527
-Let's get up. I'll take you home.
-No. I'm not going.

48:25.611 --> 48:29.364
-What's wrong with you? Get up.
-No. I'm not going.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.327
-Let's go. I'll take you home.
-I'm not going.

48:33.410 --> 48:35.162
Get up!

48:37.289 --> 48:38.707
You're being annoying.

48:39.791 --> 48:40.626
Annoying?

48:42.127 --> 48:46.340
Hey. You're the most annoying.
You keep changing.

48:46.423 --> 48:48.133
You weren't like that before.

48:48.216 --> 48:50.886
-Get up.
-Don't change.

48:50.969 --> 48:53.472
Get up. Let's go.

48:53.555 --> 48:56.600
Don't do that.

48:57.184 --> 48:59.478
-Put her on my back.
-What the heck?

49:00.687 --> 49:03.440
I'm dizzy. No.

49:03.523 --> 49:06.109
Stop it. No.

49:06.193 --> 49:07.986
-She stinks.
-Eun!

49:08.570 --> 49:12.032
Eun! You're the only one for me.

49:12.115 --> 49:15.535
I was the only one for you too. Eun!

49:18.163 --> 49:19.581
Excuse me.

49:20.832 --> 49:22.959
-Is she drunk?
-What's going on?

49:23.043 --> 49:24.711
What's all this fuss?

49:25.170 --> 49:26.630
Why is she so drunk?

49:26.713 --> 49:28.090
She's wasted.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.258
Where? There?

49:30.425 --> 49:31.843
Put me down.

49:34.137 --> 49:36.682
My back.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.727
She's tiny, but she's heavy.

49:40.811 --> 49:41.812
Come out.

49:44.981 --> 49:46.900
-Thanks.
-No problem.

49:46.983 --> 49:48.944
This is why we need a man in the house.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.654
Right? Don't you feel safer?

49:51.238 --> 49:52.656
-Good night.
-Night.

49:59.496 --> 50:02.374
He would be perfect
if he were slightly longer.

50:03.291 --> 50:05.877
My back.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.340
What?

50:11.216 --> 50:12.259
What?

50:13.260 --> 50:14.428
You thank me?

50:15.345 --> 50:17.681
If that's what you want to hear, sure.

50:24.062 --> 50:26.857
Lay her on her side in case she throws up.
That's dangerous.

50:27.232 --> 50:28.108
Okay.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.068
Sorry.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.112
She's mad at me.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.239
What did you do?

50:38.243 --> 50:39.119
I don't know.

50:40.787 --> 50:42.205
That's how it is.

50:42.289 --> 50:45.667
No one did the hurting,
but a person was hurt.

50:45.834 --> 50:46.877
Do you mean you?

50:59.389 --> 51:01.725
I was only kidding.

51:24.206 --> 51:27.584
I hate you, Eun. I really hate you.

51:30.587 --> 51:34.382
Why do you keep changing? Don't change.

51:34.466 --> 51:38.261
I like you so much.

51:41.223 --> 51:44.351
No one did the hurting,

51:44.434 --> 51:46.269
but a person was hurt.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.093
You witch.

52:18.426 --> 52:20.887
You're the worst, you witch.

52:21.179 --> 52:24.015
-Let's go. I'll take you home.
-I'm not going.

52:24.099 --> 52:26.184
-Get up.
-Don't change.

53:08.685 --> 53:11.479
The toilet is clogged again.
Who used it last?

53:11.563 --> 53:14.024
Who ate my jam? This isn't...

53:14.107 --> 53:16.902
I'm cooking only one. Don't ask later...

53:16.985 --> 53:19.446
We have to go grocery shopping.
Do you need...

53:19.529 --> 53:20.822
Hurry up.

53:20.906 --> 53:22.616
Buy me jam.

53:22.699 --> 53:24.618
-Someone ate all of mine.
-This is mine.

54:06.201 --> 54:08.495
-What are you doing?
-I'm throwing them out.

54:13.541 --> 54:17.545
Don't pick me up at the bus stop anymore.

54:40.527 --> 54:41.736
How did you do?

54:55.417 --> 54:58.003
-Sorry.
-Why did you leave this morning?

54:58.712 --> 54:59.879
I felt humiliated.

55:00.213 --> 55:02.507
-You should be.
-I know.

55:03.258 --> 55:04.759
How much did you drink?

55:05.176 --> 55:06.720
Two bottles of soju.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.096
You've lost your mind.

55:08.179 --> 55:09.180
And a half.

55:09.472 --> 55:10.640
Don't do that again.

55:10.724 --> 55:12.976
Okay. So don't you do that either.

55:13.059 --> 55:14.102
What did I do?

55:14.394 --> 55:16.479
Don't talk about others in front of me.

55:17.897 --> 55:21.359
And move out of that house.
I don't like it.

56:37.894 --> 56:39.062
Hey.

56:40.563 --> 56:42.941
Hey.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.110
Go to your room.

56:47.570 --> 56:49.239
Sleep in your room.

56:54.494 --> 56:57.497
Sorry. I'm at the bus stop.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.290
I just can't go alone.

57:00.041 --> 57:01.960
Hey. Ye-eun texted.

57:02.043 --> 57:03.419
Get up.

57:12.804 --> 57:15.473
-I'm still at school.
-I'm working late.

57:30.697 --> 57:31.531
Jerk.

57:35.452 --> 57:39.247
I always keep a distance,
to avoid getting too close.

57:39.330 --> 57:40.915
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

57:40.999 --> 57:43.084
What's wrong with guys?

57:43.668 --> 57:46.337
Why are their moms and dads
always the priority?

57:47.046 --> 57:51.342
I always keep a distance,
so people can't come too close.

58:07.567 --> 58:10.737
HEALTH DRINK

58:14.324 --> 58:15.700
RICE PORRIDGE

58:30.089 --> 58:31.549
It's 4,900 won.

58:39.307 --> 58:41.392
I'll take just this.

58:52.070 --> 58:55.615
Keeping a distance means isolating myself.

58:55.698 --> 58:56.866
It's 900 won.

58:57.825 --> 59:02.789
Keeping a distance
means that's how lonely I am.

59:04.457 --> 59:06.543
Survival. That's right.

59:07.168 --> 59:08.878
This is my survival tactic.

59:09.879 --> 59:12.465
I've lived like a race horse in a stable.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.633
Excuse me.

59:23.351 --> 59:25.103
What's this?

59:33.611 --> 59:35.613
That's how I survived.

59:36.906 --> 59:39.867
And that's how I will survive.

59:58.219 --> 59:59.637
Hey.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:10.982
Eun-jae is drunk,
so she won't be able to come.

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:16.404
If you don't mind me...

1:00:17.363 --> 1:00:18.615
Thank you.

1:01:06.746 --> 1:01:10.792
Stop the Misconduct!

1:01:28.810 --> 1:01:30.687
That's it for what's planned.

1:01:31.270 --> 1:01:36.275
Lastly, the artist with the greatest loss
last year was Asgard.

1:01:36.859 --> 1:01:40.405
Actually, they've had the highest loss
over the past three years.

1:01:40.488 --> 1:01:43.366
They've netted a loss since their debut.

1:01:44.409 --> 1:01:45.660
It's sad,

1:01:46.828 --> 1:01:48.913
but as per company policy,

1:01:48.996 --> 1:01:51.582
we will take a vote
regarding canceling their contract.

1:01:54.419 --> 1:01:56.129
You can't abstain.

1:01:56.921 --> 1:01:59.424
You have to vote for or against
canceling the contract.

1:02:01.634 --> 1:02:03.428
I had to keep a distance.

1:02:26.826 --> 1:02:29.787
That jerk is going on a blind date.
Set me up with a guy.

1:02:29.871 --> 1:02:32.039
You said to get over a guy with a new guy.

1:02:32.123 --> 1:02:34.417
Tell me your name.
I'll say your name on stage next time.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.461
-It's okay.
-I'll get a chance one day.

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:39.797
Asgard will be disbanded.

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:42.508
There he is again. What's wrong with him?

1:02:42.592 --> 1:02:44.844
Oh. Ho-chang Kwon.

1:02:44.927 --> 1:02:46.637
You want to talk?

1:02:47.221 --> 1:02:48.848
I want to introduce someone to you.

1:02:49.474 --> 1:02:51.601
-Eun didn't tell you about me?
-Sorry?

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:53.269
You don't care if you hurt me?

1:02:53.352 --> 1:02:55.438
You said you hate hurting
someone who likes you.

1:02:56.105 --> 1:02:58.024
Hyo-jin transferred

1:02:58.107 --> 1:03:00.568
because of a weird rumor
with the art teacher.

1:03:00.651 --> 1:03:03.654
-What does that have to do with you?
-I'm scared that it does.

1:03:03.738 --> 1:03:05.948
