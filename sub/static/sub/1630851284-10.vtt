10:21.455 --> 10:22.846
Not Protestants.

10:22.864 --> 10:24.681
<i> La beata madre è stata</i>

10:24.699 --> 10:26.532
<i> concepita senza</i>
<i> peccato originale.</i>

10:26.685 --> 10:29.944
<i> Quindi è possibile</i>
<i> che sia madre e vergine.</i>

10:29.963 --> 10:31.254
Oh. Got it.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.281
This is Saint Lucia,

10:34.450 --> 10:37.135
which may or may not be
where my money is.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.879
And this is St. Zeno of Verona,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.474
the saint of learning to speak.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.684
For you, Margaret.

10:46.295 --> 10:47.461
Hmm.

10:47.539 --> 10:50.565
Ah, you got to love
a religion with merch.

10:52.727 --> 10:54.986
Maybe this could work out.

10:55.138 --> 10:58.548
You just enjoy riding
in a safe car for once.

10:58.641 --> 11:01.142
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do!

11:01.161 --> 11:03.219
For the family.

11:03.312 --> 11:05.330
Stop so we can do
the door again.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.167
Whoa, Mama!
(laughs)

11:09.318 --> 11:11.086
D'oh!

11:12.321 --> 11:14.731
I can't believe the boss
has us babysitting.

11:14.824 --> 11:17.384
I broke out of prison for this?

11:20.830 --> 11:22.329
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:22.424 --> 11:25.183
Careful, those babies got those
super sharp fingernails!

11:27.929 --> 11:30.105
Here ya go, Baby Boss.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.029
<i> Mangia. Mangia.</i>

11:38.256 --> 11:39.513
Leave no evidence.

11:39.607 --> 11:41.348
Boss,
Benny down at the liquor store

11:41.368 --> 11:43.776
is late on his payment. Again.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.686
Let me break his kneecaps.

11:45.855 --> 11:47.038
<i> Marone a mi!</i>

11:47.190 --> 11:49.449
You never ever talk that way
in front of a baby.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.209
Uh, uh, okay, uh,

11:51.436 --> 11:53.878
what if we give him
a boo-boo to the brain?

11:53.955 --> 11:56.697
Make him go night-night forever?

11:56.791 --> 11:57.915
Disgusting!

11:58.142 --> 12:00.276
You give the kiss of death
with that mouth?

12:00.295 --> 12:02.870
Now, if you'll excuse me...

12:02.964 --> 12:05.039
I have to take
sweet little Maggie

12:05.133 --> 12:07.208
to Guido and Me class.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.118
(humming happily)

12:09.212 --> 12:11.304
I think the boss is
gettin' soft.

12:11.456 --> 12:13.064
Next thing you know,
he'll be startin'

12:13.216 --> 12:15.233
a<i> legitimate</i>
legitimate business!

12:15.460 --> 12:17.402
Eh, I think
you're imagining things.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.090
(all gasping)

12:39.926 --> 12:41.575
Ah, it's-a so sad.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.003
Fat Tony has been
a very good boss.

12:44.172 --> 12:48.174
I have too much respect
for him not to kill him.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.493
Eh, what do you think,
Johnny Tightlips?

12:50.586 --> 12:53.162
I don't want
to do nothin' to nobody.

12:53.181 --> 12:55.681
So... you want to do
somethin' to somebody.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.333
Exactly.

12:57.426 --> 12:59.502
Does Maggie seem different
to you?

12:59.521 --> 13:00.686
I'm worried.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.672
Uh, Marge,
let me put it this way.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.340
We can't be bad parents,

13:04.359 --> 13:07.268
because bad parents can't
get their kid into...

13:07.287 --> 13:10.013
the finest preschool in town!

13:10.031 --> 13:11.438
Maggie has been admitted

13:11.533 --> 13:13.941
to the Preschool
for the Performing Arts?

13:14.019 --> 13:15.960
They have a three-year wait.

13:16.112 --> 13:18.521
Is she in the morning class
or afternoon?

13:18.540 --> 13:19.780
Morning.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.633
-Mm.
-(knocking)

13:21.784 --> 13:24.285
I'm afraid we have
an agreement

13:24.379 --> 13:26.212
and you have not held up
your end.

13:26.364 --> 13:28.807
We are going for a ride.

13:29.034 --> 13:31.476
(whimpering)

13:34.873 --> 13:37.315
No!

13:38.726 --> 13:42.136
No goddaughter of mine
will miss Sunday service.

13:42.213 --> 13:44.138
Oh, but I'm hungover.

13:44.215 --> 13:46.307
We were gonna go at 1:00 p.m.

13:46.401 --> 13:48.493
I'm afraid there ain't
no 1:00 p.m. no more.

13:48.644 --> 13:50.811
Low attendance whacked it
from the schedule.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.055
I knew it.

13:52.148 --> 13:53.239
You make a deal with the devil,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.666
and look where you wind up.

13:54.817 --> 13:56.392
-(snoring)
-Wake up.

13:56.411 --> 13:57.335
(blabbering)

13:57.562 --> 13:58.819
Oh, come on, man.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.396
Even the priest is asleep.

14:00.565 --> 14:01.840
(yawns)

14:02.067 --> 14:05.176
Please rise
and open your hymnals.

Look, if we're direct
and say he can't be godfather,

14:22.437 --> 14:24.270
what's the worst
that can happen?

14:24.422 --> 14:26.180
Did you see<i> The Godfather?</i>

14:26.274 --> 14:27.773
I saw the wedding part.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.534
Does anything happen after that?

14:29.685 --> 14:32.537
That Carlo seems
like a wonderful husband.

14:32.764 --> 14:35.598
-What are you talking about?
-Uh, Mister Fat?

14:35.617 --> 14:38.710
There's a non-whacking matter
I need to discuss with you.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.620
I also have
to tell you something.

14:40.772 --> 14:44.123
Your daughter is cute, smart,
and sweet as a hung jury.

14:44.275 --> 14:46.551
So I will honor
all of you next Sunday

14:46.778 --> 14:49.870
with tickets to Itchy
and Scratchy's Christmas On Ice.

14:49.964 --> 14:54.041
Now, what did you want
to tell me?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.227
I, um, uh, stall, stall...

14:56.304 --> 14:58.287
play for time...
(stammers)

14:58.306 --> 15:01.048
I wanted to tell you
how great you look in that suit.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.458
Why, thank you.

15:02.477 --> 15:04.051
Why do people have
such difficulty

15:04.070 --> 15:05.612
telling me how great I am?

15:10.059 --> 15:12.243
This is
the first business I've had

15:12.395 --> 15:14.895
where in the back room is
just more of the same.

15:14.989 --> 15:17.140
Thoughts?

15:17.158 --> 15:19.066
Hey, these diaper bags
are great.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.144
You could hide a brick
of nose candy in here.

15:21.237 --> 15:23.737
No, you<i> mezzo arguto paisan!</i>

15:23.757 --> 15:25.239
This is all aboveboard.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.074
I want to be family friendly.

15:27.168 --> 15:29.743
You mean "the family" family?

15:29.837 --> 15:31.854
I mean every family!

15:31.914 --> 15:33.656
Except the Branzinos.

15:33.749 --> 15:35.158
Death to them.

15:35.176 --> 15:36.325
ALL THREE:
Death to them.

15:36.419 --> 15:37.268
Hey, boss, maybe you can get

15:37.495 --> 15:39.679
your little Maggie one of these.

15:39.831 --> 15:42.565
You would body shame a baby?!

15:44.778 --> 15:46.593
-(door closes)
-I've seen enough.

15:46.762 --> 15:48.613
This Sunday we make our move.

15:48.764 --> 15:50.281
Can we make it Saturday?
I got a thing.

15:50.508 --> 15:52.508
-Move your thing.
-I already moved it

15:52.527 --> 15:54.285
for the thing that was cancelled
for the you know what

15:54.512 --> 15:56.028
where we did that thing
we did not do.

15:56.181 --> 15:58.272
That didn't happen
two weeks ago.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.940
You don't know about that!

16:00.034 --> 16:02.868
You don't know
what I don't know.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.521
Um, we certainly appreciate

16:05.540 --> 16:07.373
all you've done for us.

16:07.525 --> 16:10.677
Maggie has all the bling
a toddler could want.

16:13.531 --> 16:14.455
Don't look at me.

16:14.549 --> 16:16.724
They fell off the back
of a tricycle.

16:18.536 --> 16:20.127
(crying)

16:20.146 --> 16:22.522
(gasps)
What have we done?

16:25.134 --> 16:27.043
Uh, Maggie! What are ya doin'?

16:27.061 --> 16:28.987
I didn't mean it! Maggie!

16:29.823 --> 16:32.156
Fat Tony, get away from my kid!

16:34.385 --> 16:36.035
That's it.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.832
Fine. I see.

16:40.983 --> 16:44.060
Excuse me,
there is an urgent matter

16:44.229 --> 16:46.045
I must attend to.

16:57.925 --> 16:59.242
(burps)

16:59.244 --> 17:02.002
Homer, can I tell you
a little secret?

17:02.022 --> 17:04.580
-No, no, please don't!
-It's a good secret.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.191
I'm finally getting out of
this terrible business I'm in.

17:07.343 --> 17:10.010
And into the slightly
less cutthroat business

17:10.088 --> 17:11.937
of maternity wear.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.865
I'm gonna get my soul back.

17:13.941 --> 17:16.776
And Maggie is my inspiration.

17:16.928 --> 17:19.019
-Aw.
-Give me one more day

17:19.039 --> 17:20.872
to prove
that I belong in her life.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.707
I'll see what I can do.

17:22.784 --> 17:24.959
(giggles)

17:26.195 --> 17:28.104
Legs! Louie! Get in here!

17:28.197 --> 17:29.363
Dispose of this.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.425
I don't want
to know where or how.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.469
Ain't nobody gonna
find this now.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.522
Uh,<i> marone.</i>
You never forget that smell.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.415
Remember: take the gun.

18:04.567 --> 18:06.250
Leave the Zamboni.

18:06.477 --> 18:08.978
Okay, this is it.
I'm ending it today.

18:09.071 --> 18:12.298
In a public place
with a lot of witnesses.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.673
Well, Fat Tony,
this is really fun,

18:20.825 --> 18:22.825
but where is everyone else?

18:22.844 --> 18:25.103
On the suggestion
of my coworkers,

18:25.330 --> 18:27.772
who only have
my best interests in mind,

18:27.999 --> 18:29.832
I bought out the whole arena

18:29.925 --> 18:32.426
for my dear little Maggie.

18:32.595 --> 18:34.595
No audience means no witnesses!

18:34.614 --> 18:36.114
What's going on?

18:36.265 --> 18:38.357
Fat Tony, I beg you!

18:38.509 --> 18:41.268
Stop being
my daughter's godfather!

18:41.287 --> 18:43.621
If you do, I'll clean for you,
I'll cook for you.

18:43.772 --> 18:45.531
I'll be your mama!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.583
God rest her soul.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.444
I must refuse your offer.

18:50.538 --> 18:53.131
I made a promise to God
to watch your baby.

18:53.358 --> 18:55.949
And he's the only boss
I answer to.

18:56.043 --> 18:59.286
Except that guy in Kansas City.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.972
<i> MARGE:</i>
<i> Oh, no! No!</i>

19:01.123 --> 19:02.548
<i> We're stuck with him forever!</i>

19:02.700 --> 19:04.392
<i> Maggie's in Hell already!</i>

19:13.153 --> 19:14.710
Johnny Tightlips!

19:14.803 --> 19:16.470
This is it, Tony.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.231
You did the worst thing
a mob boss could ever do.

19:19.384 --> 19:21.384
Care about somebody else.

19:21.402 --> 19:24.162
I thought you was
with me on this double cross!

19:24.389 --> 19:27.147
We'll never turn on Tony!
He's my cousin!

19:27.167 --> 19:28.666
I thought he was my cousin!

19:28.893 --> 19:30.242
Well, he's somebody's cousin.

19:30.395 --> 19:32.561
And in this world,
that's what counts.

19:32.563 --> 19:34.321
You would betray me?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.414
(grunts)

19:35.566 --> 19:36.716
(gasps)

19:38.753 --> 19:41.070
No, Maggie, no! I'm sorry!

19:41.088 --> 19:43.664
-That's not me!
-Oh, isn't it?

19:43.832 --> 19:45.241
Oh, my God, you're right.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.851
I cannot change who I am.

19:47.078 --> 19:49.169
Also that maternity store
was a joke.

19:49.263 --> 19:51.004
They look, but don't buy.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.933
But, Maggie, it's not too late
for you to go straight.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.585
I'm stepping back as godfather.

19:56.679 --> 19:57.895
-Finally.
-Thank God.

19:58.047 --> 19:59.513
(grunting)

19:59.532 --> 20:00.606
Oops.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.426
Here's the keys to the SUV.

20:03.444 --> 20:05.453
(both grunting)

20:09.100 --> 20:11.951
You have to let go
for me to take them back.

20:12.103 --> 20:13.436
I know, let me just

20:13.454 --> 20:15.454
open the doors one more time.

20:15.531 --> 20:16.697
(alarm chirps)

20:16.716 --> 20:18.549
(grunts, groans)

20:18.701 --> 20:20.943
Maggie, my darling.

20:21.036 --> 20:23.370
Thank you for reminding me
of everything

20:23.389 --> 20:25.539
that's good and sweet
in this world.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.708
And now,<i> ciao bella.</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:29.118
(sniffing)
Ew, uh,

20:29.136 --> 20:31.562
before you go... could you?

20:31.714 --> 20:33.397
Just when I thought I was out,

20:33.566 --> 20:36.067
they drag me back in.

20:50.141 --> 20:51.398
I'm not afraid to say it.

20:51.492 --> 20:53.417
If this keeps up,
I'm calling HR.

20:53.644 --> 20:56.545
You mean Harry the Rat?
He's buried right over there.
