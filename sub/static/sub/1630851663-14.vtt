WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.337
Narrator: Tonight, Emma Grede,

00:03.337 --> 00:05.873
founder and CEO of smash-hit
apparel brand Good American

00:05.873 --> 00:09.243
and founding partner of Skims,
returns to the Tank.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.711
Grede: You can spend
the next few years

00:10.711 --> 00:12.613
trying to accelerate
this business,

00:12.613 --> 00:14.481
or you can work with me and
do it a hell of a lot quicker.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.750
What about me?
Am I chopped liver?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.285
Precious gold, Sharks.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.620
You're nuts.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.788
My parents, they migrated
to this country with nothing.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.691
The fact that their son
is here today is huge.

00:24.691 --> 00:29.429
You've demonstrated every bit
that you are an entrepreneur.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.465
Somebody could
make this at home,

00:31.465 --> 00:32.966
but they're not going to
want to.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.701
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.169
Don't panic.

00:44.511 --> 00:48.482
Narrator:
First in the Tank is a beauty
brand with inclusivity in mind.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.657
Hi, Sharks. Hi, Sharks.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.325
I'm Alicia.
I'm Myisha.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.527
We're two cousins here
from Atlanta, Georgia,

01:00.527 --> 01:02.629
and we're seeking 150K

01:02.629 --> 01:06.567
for 6% equity
in our company.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.535
Sharks,
how can you feel beautiful

01:08.535 --> 01:10.704
in the skin you're in
if you feel forgotten?

01:10.704 --> 01:13.607
Not only did the both of us
struggle to find makeup

01:13.607 --> 01:16.743
for our beautiful
brown skin,

01:16.743 --> 01:19.079
but we also couldn't find
skin-care products

01:19.079 --> 01:21.582
made with our
skin types in mind.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.518
That's why we set out
on a mission to create...

01:24.518 --> 01:26.053
Range Beauty. Range Beauty.

01:26.053 --> 01:29.356
Range Beauty is clean beauty
for the forgotten shades,

01:29.356 --> 01:32.159
and we utilize botanicals
in our formulas

01:32.159 --> 01:35.162
specially made for eczema
and acne-prone skin.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.497
Now any and everyone
can feel beautiful,

01:37.497 --> 01:40.133
comfortable, and confident
in their own skin.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.368
At Range Beauty,

01:41.368 --> 01:43.503
our True Intentions
Hydrating Foundation

01:43.503 --> 01:46.974
is available in 21
underrepresented shades,

01:46.974 --> 01:50.110
using calendula flower to help
with itchiness and irritation...

01:50.110 --> 01:53.146
Fresh clay to help with those
nasty and unwanted toxins...

01:53.146 --> 01:56.049
And even vitamin "E"
to help keep your skin healthy

01:56.049 --> 01:57.818
and glowing.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.053
Both: That's right.
We keep it clean.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.888
Sharks, we're merging
inclusive makeup

02:01.888 --> 02:03.256
with natural skin care.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.125
Myisha, show off
all that melanin.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.527
Sharks, you better get into
this glow.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.262
We should all be in love
with our skin,

02:09.262 --> 02:11.498
no matter the shade
or type.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.567
Both: So, Sharks,
will you join us

02:13.567 --> 02:16.069
in showing off
our Range to the world?

02:16.069 --> 02:17.738
Great job.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.374
You see our beautiful products
in front of you.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.908
Emma, we gave you

02:21.908 --> 02:23.910
our True Intentions
Hydrating Foundation,

02:23.910 --> 02:26.380
the full size,
as well as our sample kit,

02:26.380 --> 02:28.315
which we offer online
to help our guests

02:28.315 --> 02:29.783
find their perfect shade.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.518
Really nice packaging.

02:31.518 --> 02:34.655
Barbara, we gave you
our Bali Full Body Glow.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.889
Mm, I need it.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.959
It is packed
with a superfood, argan oil.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.027
Beautiful color.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.361
What about me?
Am I chopped liver?

02:41.361 --> 02:44.097
Oh, don't worry.
We're coming that way.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.099
We gave you Golden Hour
- Dual Eye/
- Highlight

02:46.099 --> 02:48.802
to match
that glowing smile.
What?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.738
Lori, you have our
True Intentions Bronzing Primer.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.207
It's a moisturizer
and a primer.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.943
And, Mr. Wonderful,
don't think we left you out.
O'Leary:
Yes, I mean, you know,

02:56.943 --> 02:59.446
I was thinking
you don't love Mr. Wonderful.
We know you have
a lot of skin.

02:59.446 --> 03:03.183
You have a lot of skin
you have to keep shine-free.
I have a lot of skin.
That's right.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.219
And I was just -- By the way,
I was just admiring it.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.789
So we gave you our Smooth Out
Translucent Powder,

03:08.789 --> 03:11.825
which is talc-free,
and that helps combat shine

03:11.825 --> 03:15.328
and gives you
a smooth, flawless look.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.431
What's your background?
How did you even
come up with this?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.833
I actually grew up
loving fashion.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.967
I went off to
Virginia Tech

03:20.967 --> 03:22.536
for fashion design
and merchandising,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.404
and immediately
after graduation,

03:24.404 --> 03:25.906
I was on my way
to New York.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.575
And I would be
behind the scenes

03:28.575 --> 03:30.444
at runway shows,
campaign shoots,

03:30.444 --> 03:32.746
and I noticed
a lot of the Black models

03:32.746 --> 03:35.182
were coming to set
with their own makeup kits,

03:35.182 --> 03:38.185
and it made me pause
and finally ask a model

03:38.185 --> 03:40.220
what was so special
about this kit.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.389
And she said
on a previous campaign,

03:42.389 --> 03:43.857
the makeup artist
flat out said,

03:43.857 --> 03:45.692
"I can't do the look
the designer is requesting

03:45.692 --> 03:48.562
because I don't have anything
in my kit for your skin tone."

03:48.562 --> 03:52.232
And it resonated with me
because I never felt represented

03:52.232 --> 03:53.867
or seen
by the beauty industry.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.435
And at the same time,
I was also dealing

03:55.435 --> 03:58.405
with very bad cystic acne
and head-to-toe eczema.

03:58.405 --> 04:02.776
So I did not feel very pretty,
and I just had an aha moment

04:02.776 --> 04:05.345
that, why can't I merge
both of these worlds?

04:05.345 --> 04:09.816
Why can't I create makeup that
includes our tones and deeper

04:09.816 --> 04:12.085
and also takes care of your skin
while you wear,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.688
especially if you're dealing
with eczema and acne?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.256
Myisha, what do you do
in the business?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.525
So I did 10 years
in the United States Army.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.994
I'm a veteran,
and I'm a single mom.
Oh, wow.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.930
Thank you
for your service.
I'm, like,
the product manager.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.298
I went to school
to be aesthetician

04:25.298 --> 04:27.400
to learn about skin care
just so I can assist her

04:27.400 --> 04:29.736
in any and everything
that she needs.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.738
Talk to us a little bit
about the business

04:31.738 --> 04:33.874
and also, like,
what makes you guys different.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.542
I would say
the main thing

04:35.542 --> 04:38.145
is that our angle
is eczema and acne.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.747
Most of the times, makeup
brands, they're thinking about,

04:40.747 --> 04:41.882
"We want you to keep
coming back to us

04:41.882 --> 04:43.350
so you can keep
covering it up,"

04:43.350 --> 04:44.918
while we're coming
from the angle of,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.720
"Yes, we want you to be able
to cover it up

04:46.720 --> 04:47.788
and feel comfortable

04:47.788 --> 04:50.123
but at the same time
also have healthy skin."

04:50.123 --> 04:51.358
That's our angle.

04:51.358 --> 04:54.161
And we launched
at the end of August of 2018.

04:54.161 --> 04:57.364
I completely bootstrapped this
for about three years.

04:57.364 --> 05:00.734
At the end of 2018,
we left with about 20K.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.203
2019, we ended 45K.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.839
I quit my job
in December of 2019

05:05.839 --> 05:07.507
to take on Range
full time.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.309
So last year
was my first full year,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.745
and we ended up with 330K.
- Wow.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.213
- Wow.
- Good for you.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.182
And so how did you get --
how'd you get to $330,000?

05:15.182 --> 05:17.517
How'd you do it?
So last year showed us

05:17.517 --> 05:19.820
that, actually, e-commerce
does reign supreme,

05:19.820 --> 05:22.422
and so I made sure
I already had things in place

05:22.422 --> 05:23.423
to help us with that.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.058
Our sample kit
for foundations,

05:25.058 --> 05:27.160
we gave you $5
in exchange

05:27.160 --> 05:29.329
for you to put towards
a full-sized product.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.998
So 80% of our customers
who purchased our samples

05:31.998 --> 05:34.434
came back to buy a full-size.
- That's very smart.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.969
Last year,
we actually picked up

05:35.969 --> 05:38.305
our first major
big-box retailer,

05:38.305 --> 05:39.372
and we are currently
in talks

05:39.372 --> 05:40.907
with one of
the largest beauty retailers

05:40.907 --> 05:42.509
to actually go in-store
and on dot-com --

05:42.509 --> 05:43.977
Which retailer?
Target.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.145
And how's it
selling through?

05:45.145 --> 05:47.047
It's been selling out.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.851
Does Target explain the $330,000
uptick in sales?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.620
I would say, last year,
with everything going on,

05:53.620 --> 05:56.923
there was a huge spotlight
put on Black-owned businesses,

05:56.923 --> 05:58.658
and that exposure
was exposure

05:58.658 --> 06:01.361
that we did not have
the marketing budget for.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.197
We were featured by BeyoncÃ©
on her website. Wow.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.066
Yes.
We were covered
by major publications.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.367
- That's amazing.
- That'll do it right there.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.570
Yes, and that
absolutely contributed.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.606
What's the price point?
Give me a rough...

06:12.606 --> 06:14.875
Yes, so our foundation
is $21.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.011
It lands at $4.25
for cost,

06:18.011 --> 06:20.080
and we wholesale
at $10.50.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.681
So you're, like,
at the masstige level.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.483
Absolutely.
What is masstige?

06:23.483 --> 06:26.786
Masstige is in between
drugstore products

06:26.786 --> 06:28.088
and prestige products.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.223
- It's right in the middle.
- Masstige.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.893
I'm so happy
to teach you something.
I'm amazed.
I didn't know that.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.461
Wow, at least we taught him
something about your business.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.896
Cuban: Guys...
Yes?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.130
...I'm gonna make it easy,
I'm gonna clear the deck,

06:37.130 --> 06:38.498
'cause literally
the only two things

06:38.498 --> 06:39.933
I understand what they are

06:39.933 --> 06:41.902
are the mirror
and the toothbrush.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.704
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.740
Okay, thank you. Okay,
thank you so much.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.276
Do you do the lighter
skin shades, or is it just --

06:49.276 --> 06:51.044
'cause you said
21 shades, right?

06:51.044 --> 06:52.779
Yes,
so we are inclusive.

06:52.779 --> 06:55.115
We prioritize Black women
and women of color

06:55.115 --> 06:57.250
because we are
the most underrepresented,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.551
even though
we spend the most.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.621
So we spend annually
$7.5 billion in beauty.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.623
We spend 80% more
on makeup

07:03.623 --> 07:06.726
than the mainstream market
and two times more on skin care.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.696
We are also exposed two times
more to toxic beauty products

07:09.696 --> 07:12.766
because of the lack of clean
alternatives for our skin tones.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.834
And so the necessity
for clean products

07:14.834 --> 07:17.304
for women of color
is there,

07:17.304 --> 07:20.073
but our line is inclusive
to go to fair shades

07:20.073 --> 07:21.741
from fairest of fair
to deepest of deep.

07:21.741 --> 07:24.644
- Oh, good.
- I think you're amazing,

07:24.644 --> 07:26.646
but I like to make
a big difference

07:26.646 --> 07:28.014
in the businesses
I invest in.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.983
I'm listening hard as to
where I might fit in,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.651
and I don't see the angle.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.053
Okay.
So because of that reason,

07:33.053 --> 07:34.654
I think you're gonna find
a better partner here.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.456
So I'm out.
Thank you so much.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.591
Thank you, Barbara.
I completely understand.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.659
O'Leary:
You know, normally,

07:39.659 --> 07:42.395
when makeup deals come
in "Shark Tank,"

07:42.395 --> 07:44.764
I'm pretty hard on them because
they don't have any strategy

07:44.764 --> 07:46.466
on how to differentiate themselves,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.602
and I was expecting
to eviscerate you on that topic.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.473
But, actually,
you do have a differentiation.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.208
Yes.
I am not your Shark.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.377
I'm going to be hopeful for you,
but I'm out.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.980
We appreciate that.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.248
We've had
a little conversation.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.752
We think that we'd like
to make you an offer.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.129
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out,

08:16.129 --> 08:18.198
but Lori and Emma are interested

08:18.198 --> 08:22.168
in inclusive makeup company
Range Beauty.

08:22.168 --> 08:26.806
We think that we'd like
to make you an offer.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.441
So you know
when you get two Sharks,

08:28.441 --> 08:29.642
got to be a little different

08:29.642 --> 08:31.211
than what you walked in
asking for, right?

08:31.211 --> 08:32.312
That's right.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.148
So we would like
to offer you

08:35.148 --> 08:39.252
the $150,000 but for 20%,

08:39.252 --> 08:41.287
and you're gonna get
two Sharks

08:41.287 --> 08:43.656
and you're going to get
all of our knowledge

08:43.656 --> 08:46.559
and expertise
in every arena,

08:46.559 --> 08:50.630
which is really going
to help you a lot.

08:50.630 --> 08:54.234
I mean, if there was
a pair to have...

08:54.234 --> 08:56.036
So thank you so much
for your offer.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.337
Honored.

08:57.337 --> 09:03.877
Would you be willing
to do $150,000 for 10%?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.211
- No.
- No.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.881
And, you know, girls,
I think that what you've done

09:07.881 --> 09:09.215
is really great.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.917
It feels good.
It feels --

09:10.917 --> 09:12.318
It feels to me
like a premium product.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.354
So I loved it when you said
this was priced

09:14.354 --> 09:16.523
at the masstige level,
right?

09:16.523 --> 09:21.561
And incoming, you know, requests
from retail is one thing.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.630
Actually making it work
when it gets there

09:23.630 --> 09:25.432
is something
completely different... Right.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.966
...and that's where you're
gonna need the help, right?

09:26.966 --> 09:29.569
That's where the experience
and the expertise

09:29.569 --> 09:31.571
and taking
what you guys do over here

09:31.571 --> 09:34.174
and actually making it work
on the shop floor

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
is going to become
really, really important.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.244
I know that there
are retailers out there.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.712
I sit on the board
of this incredible

09:39.712 --> 09:42.248
nonprofit called
The Fifteen Percent Pledge. Yes.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.416
And, actually, you know it. Yes.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.884
You know it because
all the retailers

09:44.884 --> 09:47.087
that you're trying to get into
have taken the pledge,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.622
and what that means is that
all of these businesses

09:49.622 --> 09:53.493
are looking at, "How can
we increase the level of sales

09:53.493 --> 09:55.862
that we have with
Black-owned businesses?"
Yes.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.330
Right?
They're all trying to get there.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.166
So you guys are like a target
for any of those businesses,

10:00.166 --> 10:01.601
but you still got to work. Right.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.170
And that's where the benefit
of two Sharks... Yes.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.606
...can be really, really key
because it's not easy

10:06.606 --> 10:08.374
once you get into retail,
I'll tell you.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.110
It's every week
being on top of it.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.644
It's constant, you know,

10:11.644 --> 10:13.079
innovation
for your product line.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.148
It's staying ahead
of the competition.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.117
Considering where
your sales are today,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.518
I think it's a good deal.

10:18.518 --> 10:22.155
Would you be willing to do
- 200
- K for 20%?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.657
I like these guys.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.493
You're going back
into the other direction.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.394
Yeah, you ran
the other direction.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.764
What she says is so true
because, for some people,

10:31.764 --> 10:34.767
it's impossible
to even get in, right?
Mm-hmm.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.637
But it's staying
on the shelf.
Yeah. Right.
That's right.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.405
It's hugely important.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.875
If you don't, they're as quick
to knock you out

10:41.875 --> 10:43.743
because it's valuable
real estate.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.012
Right.
Right?
And it's limited.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.249
So I-I think we've given you
an amazing offer.

10:51.918 --> 10:52.952
Okay,
you have a deal.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.420
Yay!

10:56.856 --> 10:59.125
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much. Beautiful.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.727
- My gosh.
- Thank you so much.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.396
- I love it.
- Thank you so much.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.632
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.034
Congratulations, guys.
Well done.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.102
Thank you.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.641
Oh, my God!

11:14.641 --> 11:16.509
I feel they're gonna do
so much. This is so...
They can do so much.

11:16.509 --> 11:20.246
With Emma being all about
The Fifteen Percent Pledge... Yes.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.315
...and really rooting
for Black-owned businesses

11:22.315 --> 11:24.417
and Black-women-owned
businesses

11:24.417 --> 11:26.085
and then
just understanding

11:26.085 --> 11:28.188
how important
Range Beauty is

11:28.188 --> 11:30.456
to that community --
unbelievable.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.258
Unbelievable.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.230
Narrator: In Season 4,
we watched Tracey Noonan

11:37.230 --> 11:38.965
and her daughter, Dani Vilagie,

11:38.965 --> 11:40.533
make a deal
with Kevin O'Leary

11:40.533 --> 11:43.169
for their cupcakes in a jar,
Wicked Good Cupcakes.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.170
O'Leary:
I don't want any equity.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.739
I want a dollar
from every jar.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.708
40 cents a jar.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.976
45 cents --
you have a deal.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.744
Come to mama.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.013
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.615
Vilagie:
Before airing on "Shark Tank,"

11:55.615 --> 11:58.451
we averaged about
$40,000 a month.

11:58.451 --> 12:01.087
Noonan: After "Shark Tank,"
we started averaging

12:01.087 --> 12:03.223
$450,000 a month,

12:03.223 --> 12:07.727
which brings us to a grand total
$40 million in sales.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.728
Whoo!

12:08.728 --> 12:10.496
We always considered
ourselves lucky

12:10.496 --> 12:12.732
that we had this royalty deal
with Kevin,

12:12.732 --> 12:14.701
but Kevin was also lucky
to get us.

12:14.701 --> 12:18.037
Kevin's been paid over a
million dollars in royalty fees

12:18.037 --> 12:20.240
since we started
working with him.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.176
Wicked Good Cupcakes
collaborated with Hickory Farms.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.478
We created
a Wicked Good Gift Crate

12:25.478 --> 12:27.814
that was so popular
it sold out.

12:27.814 --> 12:31.150
We know that our customers are
going to love the combination.

12:31.150 --> 12:34.454
Because Hickory Farms
saw such positive growth,

12:34.454 --> 12:37.223
they've offered
a multi-million dollar buyout.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.791
We're gonna be acquired.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.426
<i>Everybody feels
warm and fuzzy.</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:42.762
Now it's time
to sign the deal.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.665
The acquisition for me
is proof positive

12:45.665 --> 12:47.200
royalty deals work.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.469
When a company buys out
a royalty stream,

12:49.469 --> 12:52.372
they buy out the net-present
value of that royalty stream,

12:52.372 --> 12:54.040
so it's just as good as equity

12:54.040 --> 12:55.808
and everybody
got treated fairly.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.343
I loved that deal.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.713
<i>This has been a long journey
but a fantastic outcome.</i>

13:00.713 --> 13:03.750
This is a magic moment
for Wicked and Hickory Farms.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.653
Are you worried the Sharks
won't understand our accent?

13:06.653 --> 13:08.221
Noonan:
I have so many memories

13:08.221 --> 13:10.990
of things Dani and I
have been able to do

13:10.990 --> 13:14.260
and places we went together
because of "Shark Tank."

13:14.260 --> 13:16.596
I've watched my daughter
become a millionaire.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.132
There are not a lot of parents
who can say that.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.600
And I need
to stop crying.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.838
But I'm also grateful
that something that started --

13:25.838 --> 13:28.374
the two of us with
just high-school educations,

13:28.374 --> 13:30.843
can achieve
this American dream.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.079
It's amazing,
and I'll forever be grateful

13:33.079 --> 13:34.947
to "Shark Tank"
for this opportunity.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.562
Narrator: Next up is a solution
to a stinky problem.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.473
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Regina Crisci.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.308
I'm from
Winterville, North Carolina,

14:02.308 --> 14:04.744
and I'm currently seeking
$75,000

14:04.744 --> 14:07.714
for 40% equity in my company.

14:07.714 --> 14:12.251
Sharks, who here wants
to smell a dirty, stinky diaper?

14:14.287 --> 14:15.655
Nobody.

14:15.655 --> 14:16.856
That's what I thought.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.058
So it's no surprise
that parents everywhere

14:19.058 --> 14:21.094
will try anything
to control diaper odor.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.864
We'll try plastic bags.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.533
We'll try fragrances.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.969
We'll try
expensive diaper pails.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.740
Let's be honest,
they don't always work.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.043
And if they do, they don't
control the odor for very long.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.980
So when we had to start putting
my son's dirty diapers outside,

14:40.980 --> 14:42.782
I knew that something
had to change.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.685
So that's why
I created Diaper Dust.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.688
Diaper Dust is
a diaper deodorizing powder.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.224
It's the first and only
of its kind.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.127
You simply sprinkle it over
the contents of the dirty diaper

14:54.127 --> 14:56.562
before you roll it up
and throw it away.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.232
So, Sharks, if you're smelling
what I'm smelling...

15:01.300 --> 15:04.370
...that is a deal in the air
with Diaper Dust.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.306
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so worried about
how we're testing this.

15:07.306 --> 15:11.577
So what you have in front of you
is a simulated "dirty diaper."
Greiner: Ew.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.414
Now, what I want you to do
is I want you to open it up

15:14.414 --> 15:16.482
and give it
a nice, big whiff.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.218
Oh!
- Ew!

15:19.218 --> 15:21.087
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.756
Don't panic.
Reach for your Diaper Dust.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.057
Ugh!
Reach for your Diaper Dust.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.592
It's so horrible.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.834
It works.
It absolutely worked.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.736
You just did it?
I just did it.
It works.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.938
- It definitely works.
- I'm sorry.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.706
What were we just smelling?
What was that?

15:40.706 --> 15:44.644
So that's actually
a prank spray. Oh.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.379
Let me tell you,
it's worse than the real deal.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.149
Is this powdered carbon?

15:50.149 --> 15:53.019
Yes, it is activated charcoal
and sodium bicarbonate.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.154
Greiner:
So the big question is,

15:55.154 --> 15:56.889
are there others
like this out there,

15:56.889 --> 16:00.159
and what would stop somebody
from doing it

16:00.159 --> 16:01.828
and making
the same thing?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.996
So, right now,
there is no other product

16:03.996 --> 16:07.033
that is marketed to do
what we do

16:07.033 --> 16:08.634
in terms of
the utilization of it.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.737
So we have
a patent-pending application

16:11.737 --> 16:15.308
for specifically using it
inside the diaper.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.343
Somebody could make this
at home,

16:17.343 --> 16:19.078
but they're not going to
want to.

16:19.078 --> 16:22.882
I looked like I came right out
of the industrial revolution

16:22.882 --> 16:26.085
after I'm finished making
this product in my backyard.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.454
There I am.
There I am, making it.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.089
Grede: Oh, it's like
a compost machine. Yes.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.592
That is so awesome
that you just went for it. Yes.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.394
Oh, look at that.
Greiner:
Yeah, I mean, necessity is
the mother of invention, right?

16:35.394 --> 16:37.396
Is this
your full-time job?

16:37.396 --> 16:39.365
It's not. I am actually
a full-time nurse.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.501
I'm a travel nurse.
Oh, okay.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.337
How are people responding
to the product so far,

16:44.337 --> 16:45.738
and what have you sold?

16:45.738 --> 16:49.175
So my sales --
I-I started in December --

16:49.175 --> 16:51.110
December 1, 2020.

16:51.110 --> 16:56.082
My sales aren't the greatest.
I've sold $3,000.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.017
It started out
with just friends and family,

16:58.017 --> 17:01.153
then I got on Amazon
in February.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.256
What do you sell it for?
What does it cost you to make?

17:03.256 --> 17:07.660
It's $3.15,
and I sell it for $14.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.296
So what are you doing
to market the product?

17:10.296 --> 17:11.864
Well, I'm just posting
on social media.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.433
A lot of my -- A lot of the
sales are just word-of-mouth.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.303
It's also being used
for adult incontinence.

17:17.303 --> 17:20.106
Okay,
so $75,000 for 40%.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.341
You came in here to do a deal.
There's no question. Yes.

17:22.341 --> 17:26.812
Now, how much work
is the Shark going to have to do

17:26.812 --> 17:28.047
to make this product work?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.216
You said you're
a full-time travel nurse.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.151
This is an idea.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.719
I'm looking for mentorship.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.354
As a travel nurse,

17:35.354 --> 17:38.024
I have to go onto different
units in different hospitals,

17:38.024 --> 17:39.926
and I have to
hit the ground running.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.395
The floor that I'm currently on
is trauma and transplant.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.398
I had to get on that floor
and learn trauma.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.166
I had to get on that floor
and learn transplant.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.634
So I learned from the best.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.671
I learned from the ICU nurses,
I learned from the doctors,

17:51.671 --> 17:53.706
and I am proud to say

17:53.706 --> 17:55.808
I am one of the best nurses
on that floor.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.077
Good for you.
And what a serious floor
to be on.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.412
I mean,
it's really critical.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.280
It's very intense,
but I love it.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.717
I am calm, cool,
and collected during a code.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.253
I am out of my element
in this room,

18:07.253 --> 18:08.754
but it's the room
I'm meant to be in

18:08.754 --> 18:11.757
because
you have so much to offer.

18:11.757 --> 18:16.529
So, yes, I'm gonna be
asking you a ton of questions

18:16.529 --> 18:17.930
and I hope you're okay
with that,

18:17.930 --> 18:21.634
but I will be the quickest bird
to leave the nest

18:21.634 --> 18:23.769
that you will ever see.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.005
Look, I believe there's
a demand for this product,

18:26.005 --> 18:28.507
but there's a ton of work
to do here,

18:28.507 --> 18:32.278
and my baby-diaper days
are way gone.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.080
Are your incontinence days
over, though?

18:36.248 --> 18:37.650
Oh, whoa.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.319
Oh, wow. We've never been
asked that before.

18:40.319 --> 18:43.255
Hoo-hoo-hoo-
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

18:43.255 --> 18:45.291
So you have parents.
You have parents, right,
that are gonna be --

18:45.291 --> 18:46.459
I get it,
but it's just not for me.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.027
Okay.
It's not for me.
I'm out.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.595
Thank you. Reg,
how do you scale it

18:49.595 --> 18:51.030
so you can sell
a million of them?

18:51.030 --> 18:52.965
I need this in a factory.
I need this out of my backyard.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.233
But have you gone through
the process

18:54.233 --> 18:55.935
of talking to people
to see --
I have not.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.537
Okay, so that's part
of the whole process. Right.

18:58.537 --> 19:02.508
This isn't my first language.
My first language is nursing.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.143
But I'm willing to learn.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.980
I respect people's money,
and I will fight for our money.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.017
I will fight.
I fight for my patients --

19:11.017 --> 19:13.986
Regina, I'm objecting,
more than anything --

19:13.986 --> 19:16.689
certainly not to you.
You're 100% heartfelt.

19:16.689 --> 19:20.026
The most important thing,
though, is you're part-time

19:20.026 --> 19:21.627
with a high-pressure job

19:21.627 --> 19:25.097
that you take very seriously,
again, to your credit.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.533
What you need, I believe,
is a working partner.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.268
You don't need a Shark
who's going to invest.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.870
You don't even know
what you use money for

19:30.870 --> 19:32.571
and if you need money, honestly.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.240
So I won't be
your Shark today.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.543
I'm out because I don't think
it's really what you need.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.245
Thank you.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.914
I will say
that I do have some capital.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.116
I have a home that I own

19:44.116 --> 19:46.052
that I am willing to sell,
but it would --

19:46.052 --> 19:47.753
Cuban:
No, you're not.

19:47.753 --> 19:48.954
Don't sell your house.

19:50.589 --> 19:54.727
Listen, for me,
it's not far along enough.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.696
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.130
Thank you, Lori.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.402
First of all,
I really commend you

20:03.402 --> 20:05.371
for standing here
in front of all of us.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.972
You've got
a really important job

20:06.972 --> 20:10.076
and to be doing what you do
during COVID -- unbelievable.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.410
So hats off to you.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.079
I think anyone who stands
in their garden

20:13.079 --> 20:15.981
with a composting machine
barefoot, like, doing this

20:15.981 --> 20:18.617
it's -- it's unbelievable
what you've done.
Thank you.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.953
I completely get it.
I mean, I have two children,

20:20.953 --> 20:22.421
and I've had that,
like, terrible --

20:22.421 --> 20:25.357
you know, you open the trash
and it stinks

20:25.357 --> 20:28.260
and, you know, it's like --
it's just awful.
Oh, it's just bad.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.629
I think the issue for me
on this right now

20:30.629 --> 20:33.132
is that you've really
not figured out

20:33.132 --> 20:34.900
how you're marketing
this product,

20:34.900 --> 20:37.002
and there is this huge,
you know,

20:37.002 --> 20:39.605
influencer economy
around mums.

20:39.605 --> 20:40.973
The best way for you

20:40.973 --> 20:43.709
to start creating awareness
around this product

20:43.709 --> 20:47.546
is to make the "mumfluencers"
your best friend, right,

20:47.546 --> 20:50.082
get the product out,
show them how it works.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.718
So imagine you've got a mum
with a real following

20:52.718 --> 20:54.253
who just likes
this product,

20:54.253 --> 20:55.888
and you start to get
the word of mouth out.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.424
If I were you, I'd put
any energy that I've got

20:58.424 --> 20:59.625
into marketing this.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.961
So for me right now,
I'm out,

21:01.961 --> 21:04.063
but I do wish you
the best of luck.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.698
Thank you so much.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.439
I do plan on walking away
from nursing

21:13.439 --> 21:16.909
as long as I have
the right mentor that can --

21:16.909 --> 21:19.879
Cuban: Well, let-- let's talk
about that, right?

21:19.879 --> 21:24.016
I want to be that partner
that can help you, right,

21:24.016 --> 21:27.019
'cause you've demonstrated
every bit

21:27.019 --> 21:29.455
that you are
an entrepreneur.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.625
You figured out how to make
this gunk in the backyard.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.093
You figured out
how to sell it.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.061
You figured out
the formulations.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.130
You figured out
how to do a patent,

21:38.130 --> 21:42.001
all while it not being
your first language.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.536
So I'll make you an offer.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.970
Okay.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.440
I'll give you $75,000
for 40%.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.813
That's a no-brainer.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.080
Is that a yes?
That is a deal.
Yes!

21:55.080 --> 21:56.916
- Great.
- Wow.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.451
- Congratulations.
- What a good ending!

21:59.451 --> 22:00.753
I got a pinch.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.221
Lucky woman.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.789
We'll be great.
I can't believe
this is happening.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.891
It is happening. Congratulations.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.426
Thank you.
This will be amazing.

22:07.426 --> 22:08.894
Thank you so much. Aww.

22:08.894 --> 22:11.197
Thank you so much.
Well, for all you do
for other people,

22:11.197 --> 22:13.732
now it's time for you
to have somebody help you.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.835
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch soon.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.203
- Congrats, Regina.
- Well done, you!

22:17.203 --> 22:18.838
Thank you.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.076
Crisci: I just got a deal
with Mark Cuban.

22:24.076 --> 22:28.547
I am so grateful
and blown away.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.082
Blown away.
And not just --

22:30.082 --> 22:32.651
not just with the deal,
but with all of the feedback

22:32.651 --> 22:36.455
and just how amazing
those people really are.

22:36.455 --> 22:37.623
They're better than --

22:37.623 --> 22:39.325
They're better than when
you watch them on TV.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.303
Narrator: Next in the Tank
is a food company

22:51.303 --> 22:53.706
based around
an ancient grain.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.114
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Eddie.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.083
I'm Kate.
And I'm Kyle.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.518
We're here today
seeking $300,000

23:06.518 --> 23:09.822
for 10% of our business,
Pinole Blue.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.724
In Chihuahua, Mexico,

23:11.724 --> 23:14.293
there's an indigenous community
called the Tarahumaras,

23:14.293 --> 23:16.896
who run up to 100 miles
in a single day

23:16.896 --> 23:20.199
up in the mountains with
these sandals made out of tires.

23:20.199 --> 23:23.569
So how do they have
the endurance to do that?

23:23.569 --> 23:26.372
They consume this superfood
called pinole.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.841
It is a roasted and ground
corn mixture that's been used

23:28.841 --> 23:32.077
to fuel this tribe of incredible
long-distance runners.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.513
Growing up, I wondered why
this amazing superfood

23:34.513 --> 23:36.015
didn't exist here,

23:36.015 --> 23:39.652
so I decided to bring back this
ancient Mesoamerican tradition

23:39.652 --> 23:41.353
to the United States myself

23:41.353 --> 23:44.823
while donating back directly
to the Tarahumara community.

23:44.823 --> 23:46.759
Pinole Blue is a line
of products

23:46.759 --> 23:51.397
made from 100%
USDA organic heirloom blue corn

23:51.397 --> 23:53.899
sourced from Mexico
and stone-ground

23:53.899 --> 23:58.037
with an ancient method
using volcanic rock.

23:58.037 --> 24:02.174
This blue corn is rich
in antioxidants, complex carbs,

24:02.174 --> 24:05.544
and has more protein
than other corn varieties.

24:05.544 --> 24:09.415
And we use it
in our drink mix, cookies,

24:09.415 --> 24:12.184
and even
our stone-ground tortilla

24:12.184 --> 24:14.987
that would make
your mouths water.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.122
So, Sharks, who's ready to get

24:17.122 --> 24:19.558
on the grind with Pinole Blue?

24:19.558 --> 24:22.528
Well, it smells
great in front of us, right?

24:22.528 --> 24:24.196
Tell us what we have here.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.831
We have prepared
some samples for you --

24:25.831 --> 24:29.702
Azulita cookie
and Enduro-Bites.

24:29.702 --> 24:33.105
Tastes just like
a peanut butter no-bake cookie.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.575
And atole latte,

24:36.575 --> 24:43.048
tacos with our blue,
green, and pink tortillas.

24:43.048 --> 24:44.550
This is very good.

24:44.550 --> 24:47.686
You look like
a very unusual --

24:47.686 --> 24:49.054
We get that a lot. Yeah.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.322
We get that a lot.
How did you find
each other?

24:50.322 --> 24:51.323
How did you
get together?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.492
So give you a little
of my story.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.661
Pinole just has
a certain place in my heart

24:55.661 --> 24:58.297
because it brings back
a lot of memories of my parents

24:58.297 --> 25:00.766
'cause they migrated
to this country with nothing.

25:00.766 --> 25:03.802
To come to a small town,
not knowing the language,

25:03.802 --> 25:06.338
the obstacles,
and my dad,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.874
he works in road construction
to this day.

25:08.874 --> 25:11.877
My mom was a housekeeper,
and the fact that their son

25:11.877 --> 25:13.946
is here today is huge.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.381
After graduating
high school,

25:15.381 --> 25:18.851
I went to college to Wichita
on a full-ride scholarship,

25:18.851 --> 25:22.354
and I had a class
with Professor Kate.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.690
She was actually
our business professor.
Ah, the world changed.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.692
I told her,
"I have this pinole idea,"

25:26.692 --> 25:28.093
and she looked at me
square in the eye and said,

25:28.093 --> 25:29.795
"Eddie,
that's a brilliant idea.

25:29.795 --> 25:30.929
You should start it."

25:30.929 --> 25:32.531
Next thing you know,
that holiday break,

25:32.531 --> 25:35.167
I drove to the border myself,
met my cousin,

25:35.167 --> 25:37.202
and I brought back
1,000 pounds of corn

25:37.202 --> 25:38.504
in the back
of my pickup truck.

25:38.504 --> 25:39.905
- You're nuts.
- Amazing.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.907
Yeah.
She introduces me to Kyle.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.876
She's like,
"Hey, Kyle is an engineer,

25:43.876 --> 25:46.945
but he has a wonderful
background in social media."

25:46.945 --> 25:48.847
And Kyle was another
student of Kate?

25:48.847 --> 25:50.816
Yes.
We both graduated,

25:50.816 --> 25:53.018
we took this on full time,
and we started

25:53.018 --> 25:54.787
the tortilla factory
about a year later.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.555
How much of this stuff
do you sell?

25:56.555 --> 25:59.324
Our lifetime sales so far
are $720,000.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.359
Wow.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.161
What are you projecting
this year?

26:02.161 --> 26:03.996
Are you predicting growth
for the business?

26:03.996 --> 26:06.465
We're projecting $730,000
this year.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.267
Are you guys
making money?

26:08.267 --> 26:11.003
The gross last year
is $260,000,

26:11.003 --> 26:15.641
and our net is a little bit
over $5,000 last year.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.679
Cuban: So, the biggest challenge
I see right now --

26:20.679 --> 26:23.515
it's very specific
to a certain market, right?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.950
I don't know
what that word means

26:24.950 --> 26:26.618
until you just
explained it.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.220
How are you going to
educate people?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.889
How are you going to market it
so that you get new customers

26:30.889 --> 26:32.825
that might not otherwise
know the story?

26:32.825 --> 26:37.796
Yes, our main customer segment
is Hispanic populations.

26:37.796 --> 26:40.165
However,
we are using the tortilla

26:40.165 --> 26:43.001
as a gateway product
to bring people in

26:43.001 --> 26:46.772
who is not familiar with, you
know, the pinole and the cookie.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.875
But -- But tell me how many
other companies make tortillas.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.343
Yes, there is a lot
of tortilla companies.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.212
I have noticed that
when I go to a grocery store.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.147
- That's correct.
- But I have a question.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.716
How many stone-round tortillas
that are blue corn like this?

26:57.716 --> 27:00.152
But you know what? I have never
been in a circumstance

27:00.152 --> 27:01.353
where someone said,

27:01.353 --> 27:03.922
"Is that
a stone-ground tortilla?"
Yeah.

27:03.922 --> 27:06.792
You know, just because you're
the only stone-ground tortilla

27:06.792 --> 27:08.961
doesn't mean people care.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.063
Look, guys,
what you've done is great,

27:11.063 --> 27:13.232
but to get me excited,
I have to be able to visualize

27:13.232 --> 27:14.900
it going to be $7.5 million --
or not even --

27:14.900 --> 27:16.301
$75 million in sales,

27:16.301 --> 27:19.972
and you guys haven't given me an
idea of a path that you'll take

27:19.972 --> 27:22.307
because you do have challenges
to get there.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.610
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.148
I wanted to say that
I think it's nothing
short of a miracle

27:29.148 --> 27:30.749
that you found
each other.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.184
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.386
That's pretty remarkable.
You almost seem like a family.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.622
But I think it's
a little too early for me

27:36.622 --> 27:39.358
to have the confidence
of the traction

27:39.358 --> 27:40.792
that I think it would make
enough money

27:40.792 --> 27:42.161
to have an investment in.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.662
So for that reason,
I'm out, yeah.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.066
You know, guys,
I love your stories.

27:48.066 --> 27:51.069
You know, it was so amazing
to hear that.

27:51.069 --> 27:54.873
You know, I was raised
by a single mum in East London.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.141
I'm one of four sisters.

27:56.141 --> 28:00.145
I know what it means for parents
to sacrifice everything.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.915
I think, for me,
this is just a really hard thing

28:02.915 --> 28:05.651
to invest in
at this point in time.

28:05.651 --> 28:06.718
It isn't for me
right now.

28:06.718 --> 28:08.554
So for that reason,
I'm out.

28:08.554 --> 28:09.655
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

28:09.655 --> 28:12.090
- Thank you.
- So, product tasted great.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.393
I like that it does
more than, you know,

28:14.393 --> 28:17.462
"traditional"
corn tortillas.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.465
But while I think
it's a great business for you,

28:20.465 --> 28:22.000
it's just so early.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.603
I don't know about this
as an investment for me,

28:24.603 --> 28:25.904
so I'm sorry.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.873
I'm out.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.275
Thanks, Lori.
Sandoval: Thank you.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.311
So --
O'Leary:
I respect the sales.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.579
$700,000 in sales.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.314
That's proof of concept
for sure.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.616
I'm gonna buy it,
and I'm just gonna go online

28:37.616 --> 28:39.084
and put it in my fridge

28:39.084 --> 28:41.853
'cause it's better than
the stuff I'm eating right now.

28:41.853 --> 28:45.457
But I had to listen to you for
a long time to understand that,

28:45.457 --> 28:47.659
and that's where the challenge
lies for me as an investor.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.861
I think it's pretty hard
to tell that story

28:49.861 --> 28:52.030
without a tremendous
amount of work.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.498
But I don't want
to discourage you.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.968
I mean, anybody who gets past
half a million...

28:55.968 --> 28:57.669
- Quite a feat.
- ...has found something.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.339
The reason
we are not able

29:00.339 --> 29:02.241
to scale the way
that you are talking about

29:02.241 --> 29:04.243
is because that's why
we are here.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.946
We are -- We are at a point
that the rocket is ready --

29:07.946 --> 29:10.048
It's the classic
chicken-and-tortilla problem.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.883
It's too early.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.353
It's got to have
more tortilla on the bone.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.488
I'm out.

29:16.488 --> 29:17.522
Good luck, guys. Congratulations.

29:17.522 --> 29:18.824
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you so much.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.393
You know,
before you let us go --

29:21.393 --> 29:23.128
- Professor Kate, it's over.
- Before you let us go --

29:23.128 --> 29:24.529
Professor Kate,
it's only an hour show.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.165
I-I understand,
but the end of day,

29:27.165 --> 29:30.035
you need to let the professor
have a few more minutes,

29:30.035 --> 29:32.371
you have to kind of have
a conversation.
Kate, we can't.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.139
Same thing
like my students say,

29:34.139 --> 29:35.440
"We want to leave
the classroom."

29:35.440 --> 29:37.509
I say, "Come on.
We are not done.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.910
Just a little bit longer."

29:38.910 --> 29:41.947
Well, it took us a while to get
the sales up and going

29:41.947 --> 29:44.616
was because, you know, we were
trying to figure out everything,

29:44.616 --> 29:48.687
and then we also had a setback
in 2018

29:48.687 --> 29:50.555
with Kate's husband.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.057
He had a sudden death

29:52.057 --> 29:56.595
and that kind of
hit us hard.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.430
Devastating for me
and my daughter.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.666
We choose to go
to hospice,

30:00.666 --> 30:03.969
and they come
to visit him,

30:03.969 --> 30:07.239
and after they leave,
this is what he say to me.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.041
"You have to help
those two kids

30:09.041 --> 30:13.245
because they are scrappy,
because they -- no money."

30:13.245 --> 30:15.180
And that's why, you know --
and so --

30:15.180 --> 30:17.582
But, Professor,
you <i>have</i> helped them.

30:17.582 --> 30:20.085
You're here on "Shark Tank."
Sales will grow.

30:20.085 --> 30:23.588
It's just -- It's early.
It's too early.

30:23.588 --> 30:27.025
I'm sorry, but we drove here
from Kansas.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.728
We started three years ago
with nothing.

30:29.728 --> 30:33.565
Eddie had this hand-crank
and...
Don't break it.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.667
...and started
with just this,

30:35.667 --> 30:38.170
hand-cranking it
out of the dorm room.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.339
Like, scrappy is what we do.
We've had --

30:40.339 --> 30:42.641
Emma, were you scrappy
when you got started?

30:42.641 --> 30:43.842
I was scrappy as
Sorry.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.477
Did you have a lot
going for you?

30:45.477 --> 30:47.646
Right? Did you have a lot
going for you?
Not a lot.

30:47.646 --> 30:50.015
Lori?
Scrappy.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.117
You will keep
grinding this out.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.920
It's really important
to know you're young.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.455
Like, you're just starting.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.889
This is not
the end all, be all.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.324
This is the beginning.

30:59.324 --> 31:01.059
- Well, I thank you very much...
- Good luck, guys.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.260
- Thank you.
- ...really and truly...

31:02.260 --> 31:03.528
- Thank you.
- ...for this opportunity...

31:03.528 --> 31:04.863
- Thank you, guys.
- ...and all the advice

31:04.863 --> 31:06.098
that you have,

31:06.098 --> 31:08.400
but I just wish that,
you know --

31:08.400 --> 31:09.968
- Kate. Kate. Kate!
- Kate.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.236
- Yes?
- We wish we could stay

31:11.236 --> 31:12.804
and talk forever.
We can't.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.139
You guys got to go.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.273
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.842
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

31:16.842 --> 31:17.843
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:17.843 --> 31:18.944
Keep your chin up.

31:21.947 --> 31:22.981
Aw.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.787
Offutt: I think the Sharks
made a huge mistake,

31:28.787 --> 31:31.156
and we've made it clear
that we've been able

31:31.156 --> 31:33.859
to do something really great
out of nothing.

31:33.859 --> 31:36.661
It's part of our pitch,
the grind never stops.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.239
Narrator:
Next up is a way to save

31:47.239 --> 31:50.008
every last drop
of a precious resource.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.085
Hi.
I'm Nickey Ramsey,

32:00.085 --> 32:01.787
and I'm from
West Lafayette, Indiana,

32:01.787 --> 32:06.291
and I'm here seeking $100,000
for 10% equity in my company.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.261
Sharks, when I became a mom
and started breastfeeding,

32:09.261 --> 32:11.630
I was going through thousands

32:11.630 --> 32:14.266
of these single-use
plastic storage bags

32:14.266 --> 32:16.501
to give my baby white gold.

32:16.501 --> 32:19.404
I wanted a better way
to store my breast milk,

32:19.404 --> 32:22.808
and I knew it wasn't just me
that felt this way.

32:22.808 --> 32:26.178
After countless attempts of
trying to store my breast milk,

32:26.178 --> 32:27.879
I was left with white gold

32:27.879 --> 32:29.581
leaking all over the place.

32:29.581 --> 32:30.816
Oh, no.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.651
Precious gold, Sharks.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.287
So instead of the five ounces
that I needed,

32:35.287 --> 32:36.888
I was only left with two.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.024
I literally cried
over spilled milk.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.126
Been there.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.561
I needed to create
a safe, effective,

32:42.561 --> 32:46.498
and space-saving storage option
for all mamas out there.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.233
Sharks, no more crying
over spilled milk

32:48.233 --> 32:52.537
because now you have Junobie,
a revolutionary, plastic-free,

32:52.537 --> 32:55.841
and reusable breast-milk
storage bag of its kind.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.442
Junobie is eco-friendly,

32:57.442 --> 32:59.978
made using 100%
food-grade silicone,

32:59.978 --> 33:02.314
and stands the test of time.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.950
Unlike other products out there
that have no lines

33:04.950 --> 33:08.220
or measurements
and can't stand upright,

33:08.220 --> 33:09.921
our patent-pending product

33:09.921 --> 33:13.225
is specifically made
with your baby in mind.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.994
I'm on a mission to bring
Junobie to parents everywhere

33:15.994 --> 33:17.262
for the future of our planet

33:17.262 --> 33:19.197
and for the future
of our children.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.333
âª So if you want
your milk fresh âª

33:21.333 --> 33:22.601
âª Fresh as can be âª

33:22.601 --> 33:25.003
âª Then you have to try
Junobie âª

33:26.104 --> 33:28.807
Sharks, in front of you
are your very own

33:28.807 --> 33:31.743
Junobie products to try out
and test for yourselves.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.145
So do you just
slide this off?

33:34.145 --> 33:36.281
So mine's nice and cold. Yes.
So it comes with a --

33:36.281 --> 33:38.517
Yes, it comes with a slider
in order to make sure

33:38.517 --> 33:39.951
that the breast milk
stays secure

33:39.951 --> 33:42.621
because silicone
is a very soft material,

33:42.621 --> 33:44.523
and it has to have something
a little bit hard

33:44.523 --> 33:46.358
to keep it closed. Nickey,
how do you wash it?

33:46.358 --> 33:49.327
So it's dishwasher safe.
It's high-heat tolerant.

33:49.327 --> 33:52.864
I have to say this particular
slider is very easy to put on,

33:52.864 --> 33:54.332
which I didn't expect
to be put on... Absolutely.

33:54.332 --> 33:56.468
...and very secure
as it slides into place.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.737
It stands on its own.
Absolutely. So --

33:58.737 --> 34:01.473
Barbara.
You are not getting hired
for a demo, Barb.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.408
She's really not doing
the demonstration right.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.110
Ramsey: So Barbara brings up
a great point.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.511
They can stand upright,

34:06.511 --> 34:09.614
or if you compress them
and squeeze all the air out,

34:09.614 --> 34:12.384
they have the capability
to lay flat because moms,

34:12.384 --> 34:14.619
we all know, they like
to freeze their breast milk...

34:14.619 --> 34:16.321
Of course.
...just for later use.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.722
How did you come up
with this?

34:17.722 --> 34:20.292
So I was
a traveling therapist,

34:20.292 --> 34:21.960
just returned
from maternity leave.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.997
I had a baby, of course, and
he had a tongue-tie lip-tie...

34:25.997 --> 34:28.300
Aw.
...and it's, like,
a medical condition,

34:28.300 --> 34:29.935
and he was nursing a lot.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.203
As a result of his nursing,
my body thought,

34:32.203 --> 34:33.838
"Okay, I need to produce
more milk,"

34:33.838 --> 34:36.775
and I was going through thousands

34:36.775 --> 34:39.711
of these single-use
plastic breast-milk bags.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.713
I went to the marketplace
to look for something

34:41.713 --> 34:44.349
that was a reusable product

34:44.349 --> 34:46.818
specifically made
for the size of breast milk,

34:46.818 --> 34:50.221
which typically women
store in four to six ounces.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.591
And I couldn't find anything,
of course, like it

34:52.591 --> 34:53.992
because it didn't exist.

34:53.992 --> 34:57.395
So I started working on it,
and I tapped into a need,

34:57.395 --> 34:59.531
honestly,
that I did not know existed.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.166
Incredible.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.401
Okay, how much?

35:03.401 --> 35:06.638
They retail at $34.99
for the four-pack,

35:06.638 --> 35:08.873
and our two-pack retails
at $19.99.

35:08.873 --> 35:11.977
Okay, and what does it cost you
to make the four-pack?

35:11.977 --> 35:16.081
The four-pack landed
is at around $7.80,

35:16.081 --> 35:19.851
and our two-pack landed
is around $4.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.052
Okay, good margins.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.587
I was just gonna say,
I love this product.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.089
I breastfed
both of my children,

35:24.089 --> 35:26.524
but both of my children
were born very early.

35:26.524 --> 35:27.859
So the breast milk, like,

35:27.859 --> 35:30.795
that hasn't kind of kicked in
yet becomes like gold.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.163
But what I want to understand

35:32.163 --> 35:34.265
is, like,
what your competition is.

35:34.265 --> 35:35.767
Who else is doing this?

35:35.767 --> 35:38.470
So Junobie launched
November 2019.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.904
Within six months, unfortunately,

35:39.904 --> 35:41.740
we did have some --
some knock-offs

35:41.740 --> 35:44.542
come in the market,
and the knock-offs,

35:44.542 --> 35:46.177
they can't compare to Junobie.

35:46.177 --> 35:48.980
One of our competition,
they have a bag,

35:48.980 --> 35:51.282
and, literally,
you can take the bag

35:51.282 --> 35:54.185
and just squeeze it open,
and the milk just spills out.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.554
Ooh.
What are your sales?

35:56.554 --> 36:00.158
Our sales for this year to date
have been $86,000.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.559
Did you light up
Amazon yet?

36:01.559 --> 36:03.128
So we were on Amazon,

36:03.128 --> 36:07.165
but because we have
an inventory crises, I'll say,

36:07.165 --> 36:10.001
we diverted our sales
from Amazon to our website

36:10.001 --> 36:11.870
so we can retain
more of our money.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.139
You're not on Amazon now?
Not on Amazon now.

36:14.139 --> 36:15.573
Well, but she said something
more interesting.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.375
You said you didn't have
enough inventory to keep up. Right.

36:17.375 --> 36:20.345
Because?
So since we've been
self-funding ourself

36:20.345 --> 36:23.181
pretty much with money
that comes into the company,

36:23.181 --> 36:25.383
we would --
So you needed to have
money come in

36:25.383 --> 36:26.851
before you could buy.
Exactly, yes.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.054
What's your lead time
for the manufacturing?

36:29.054 --> 36:30.422
Six weeks.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.891
Nickey, I want to hear
a little bit more about you.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.727
I grew up in a very
nontraditional household.

36:35.727 --> 36:40.065
As a teenager,
I experienced homelessness.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.667
One night
while I was sleeping

36:42.667 --> 36:45.470
on this abandoned
apartment floor,

36:45.470 --> 36:48.573
I thought to myself,
"There has to be a way

36:48.573 --> 36:52.010
out of this
generational cycle,

36:52.010 --> 36:54.345
this generational
curse of poverty."
Mm.

36:54.345 --> 36:58.016
And, thankfully,
I told my school counselor

36:58.016 --> 36:59.484
what was going on with me,

36:59.484 --> 37:02.387
and she was able to connect me
with this homeless shelter,

37:02.387 --> 37:06.791
and they let me stay there
until I finished my academics,

37:06.791 --> 37:07.992
and then I went on
to college

37:07.992 --> 37:11.529
and graduated college
and graduate school.

37:11.529 --> 37:12.864
It's a blessing
and a miracle

37:12.864 --> 37:14.332
that I'm standing here
right now.

37:14.332 --> 37:15.500
You know, never give up.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.102
Great story.
What a fabulous story.

37:17.102 --> 37:19.604
Talk to us a little bit more
about the business.

37:19.604 --> 37:22.207
You said you'd done $86,000
in sales this year,

37:22.207 --> 37:24.709
but what are you projecting
for the rest of the year?

37:24.709 --> 37:27.245
And I'm assuming the main reason
you're here talking to us

37:27.245 --> 37:29.514
is because you don't have the
money to fund your production.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.549
Is that right?
Yes, so we are projecting

37:31.549 --> 37:35.120
$300,000 in sales
by the end of this year.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.321
Wow.
Amazing.

37:36.321 --> 37:37.989
Corcoran:
Do you have them in stores?

37:37.989 --> 37:42.060
We were working with a broker
to get us in retail,

37:42.060 --> 37:45.130
but when you work with a broker,
it can get a little expensive. Yeah.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.732
Yeah.
And with the pandemic,
we thought that it was better

37:47.732 --> 37:50.468
to take the money
that we were giving the broker

37:50.468 --> 37:52.237
and put it back
into our inventory.

37:52.237 --> 37:55.206
Alright, so when I do a deal
on "Shark Tank,"

37:55.206 --> 37:57.542
I like to get my hands dirty
in the product.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.144
Okay.

37:59.144 --> 38:02.013
It's true because I try
and tell a story about it

38:02.013 --> 38:03.782
to my millions
of followers,

38:03.782 --> 38:05.683
but, obviously, this is
a disconnect for me.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.018
I mean,
I haven't been worrying

38:07.018 --> 38:09.454
about breast milk
too much lately.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.022
I mean,
I think you're terrific.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.524
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

38:12.524 --> 38:13.658
Thank you, Kevin.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.326
Cuban: Yeah, I'm kind of
in the same boat.

38:15.326 --> 38:16.895
Congratulations
on your success.

38:16.895 --> 38:20.298
The -- The road you've taken
to get where you're at,

38:20.298 --> 38:23.201
I mean, it's incredible,
and you deserve so much credit,

38:23.201 --> 38:25.537
but this is certainly
not in my wheelhouse.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.938
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.773
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.

38:28.773 --> 38:32.143
Well, after 13 seasons,
you know, it is hard

38:32.143 --> 38:34.879
to say that you're not
going to go in on a deal

38:34.879 --> 38:36.881
when you really love
an entrepreneur.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.284
You're unbelievably impressive.

38:39.284 --> 38:42.120
I think you're fantastic.
You saw a need.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.622
You had a problem.
You created a solution.

38:44.622 --> 38:47.392
But I don't think that this is
the right business for me.

38:47.392 --> 38:50.028
I wish you good luck.
I'm out.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.429
Okay, thank you, Lori.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.932
You know, Nickey, I really,
really like you.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.435
I love your story, and I love
where you're at right now.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.470
I think
it's incredible.

38:59.470 --> 39:03.007
I think that the businesses
that do really well right now

39:03.007 --> 39:05.176
are those
that have a purpose

39:05.176 --> 39:08.046
and that can really, you know,
get an audience

39:08.046 --> 39:09.914
and speak to
a very, very specific audience.

39:09.914 --> 39:13.251
And I love the fact that this is
a sustainable product

39:13.251 --> 39:16.988
and that you've got
a real clear market.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.057
So I'm actually gonna
make you an offer.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.226
I think that you are at
the beginning of the journey.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.994
You're gonna need
a lot of help.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.330
So I'm going to give you
the $100,000,

39:25.330 --> 39:28.266
but I think I need
25% of the business.

39:28.266 --> 39:29.434
Okay.

39:29.434 --> 39:30.969
That's my offer. Okay.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.006
May I hear other offers?

39:35.006 --> 39:37.609
You're so nice.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.144
I would like to hear
your offer.
I mean, you have an offer right
here, so I'll just --

39:40.144 --> 39:41.379
you know, I'm just raising
my hand to let you know.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.114
You just never know.
She might change her mind.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.849
The offer's here.
I'm ready to roll.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.618
Corcoran: That's a great offer.
Let me just tell you,

39:46.618 --> 39:48.786
I would have given
the same offer -- 25%.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.288
So I wish you luck.
I'm out.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.790
Thank you. Thank you. Nickey,
what do you want to do?

39:52.790 --> 39:58.062
Would you do $150,000
for 12%?

39:58.062 --> 39:59.264
- Whoa.
- Whoa, Nickey.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.299
- Wow.
- Whoa.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.608
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

40:10.608 --> 40:14.145
Emma has offered Nickey
$100,000 for 25%

40:14.145 --> 40:19.584
of her silicone breast-milk
storage company Junobie.

40:19.584 --> 40:26.324
Would you do $150,000
for 12%?

40:26.324 --> 40:27.458
- Whoa.
- Whoa, Nickey.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.993
- Wow.
- No.

40:28.993 --> 40:31.529
No, Nickey.
Alright, here's the thing.
Don't overnegotiate.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.965
Everybody here
has dropped out,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.833
so I'm your only hope
right now, right?

40:35.833 --> 40:37.101
I'm just gonna tell you
how it is

40:37.101 --> 40:39.904
because what you need right now
is so much.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.239
I can help you,

40:41.239 --> 40:43.474
but I think that my offer
is pretty fair.

40:43.474 --> 40:46.744
Look, you're still gonna own
75% of it.
Greiner: Right.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.846
So when this blows up,
you're still gonna be rich.
Yeah, but I'll give you
the other side of that.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.682
Corcoran: I'll give you
the other side of that.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.584
25% is a hefty slice.
Yes, it is.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.753
I'm sure you got to where
you were trusting your instinct

40:55.753 --> 40:57.055
and making
your own judgments,

40:57.055 --> 40:59.691
and from the way I see it,
you've done pretty well.

40:59.691 --> 41:03.227
So you might go into your own
self and ask you how that fits.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.498
Well, I wasn't looking at
giving up that much equity

41:07.498 --> 41:09.400
out of our company just yet.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.471
Would you do $100,000
at 15% equity?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.006
- Aw.
- Ah!

41:15.006 --> 41:19.243
I'll do $100,000
at 22.5%.

41:19.243 --> 41:20.244
Final offer.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.116
That is a lot
of liquid gold spilling.

41:27.251 --> 41:31.556
We were not looking at
giving up that much equity.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.291
You can definitely
walk back out of that door,

41:33.291 --> 41:34.859
and you can spend
the next few years

41:34.859 --> 41:36.761
trying to accelerate
this business,

41:36.761 --> 41:39.263
or you can work with me and
do it a hell of a lot quicker.

41:39.263 --> 41:41.599
But, you know,
it's your choice.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.269
Um...

41:47.739 --> 41:48.706
Wow.

41:51.709 --> 41:52.643
You got a deal.

41:52.643 --> 41:54.078
Yay!

41:54.078 --> 41:57.415
Ah!
Smart move, smart move,
smart move.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.650
Oh, my goodness.
You know how many mums
I know?

41:59.650 --> 42:01.719
We're gonna kill
this thing.
I'm excited.

42:01.719 --> 42:02.854
Ah-ha!

42:02.854 --> 42:04.255
Well done, darling.
That's so good.

42:04.255 --> 42:07.392
Ah.
I don't think I was breathing
for five minutes.

42:07.392 --> 42:09.560
Cuban: Congratulations.
Congrats, Nickey.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.762
Thank you, guys.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.864
Bye, Nickey.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.666
I am really glad that
I countered back with Emma

42:15.666 --> 42:19.270
because not only did I
keep more equity in my company,

42:19.270 --> 42:21.973
but I also got an amazing Shark

42:21.973 --> 42:24.409
who I feel is going
to be perfect for Junobie

42:24.409 --> 42:25.777
and perfect for me.
