00:08.409 --> 00:10.075
- ¶

00:10.077 --> 00:13.445
- [groans] Do you always
have to be by my locker?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.981
- Max, that's
Cherry's locker.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.249
- Oh, you're right.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.451
Oooh, a muffin!
[laughs]

00:19.453 --> 00:20.219
- Hey, guys.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.321
- Ah, don't hurt me!
I'll put it back!

00:22.323 --> 00:23.655
- [locker door slams]

00:23.657 --> 00:24.656
- Oh, this. Yeah.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.058
It belongs to my
older brother, Perry.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.961
I accidentally grabbed it
on the way out this morning.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.562
- How did you
"accidentally" do that?

00:30.564 --> 00:32.531
- I thought it was
my back scratcher.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.533
- Let's focus on
the weirder thing here.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.567
You have an older brother?

00:35.569 --> 00:37.569
- Cherry has five brothers.
- Yep.

00:37.571 --> 00:41.340
- Perry, Harry, Terry,
Barry and John Cena.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.410
- I think you made
that last one up.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.979
- Perry is training
to become a hockey pro

00:46.981 --> 00:47.713
and live in Canada.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.549
- And John is a very popular
professional wrestler.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.684
- John Cena
is not your brother!

00:52.686 --> 00:55.054
- Anyway, Perry's in town
because they're honoring him

00:55.056 --> 00:59.124
by hanging his old hockey jersey
up at the local skating rink.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.559
- Ah, hockey...

01:00.561 --> 01:02.961
I coulda gone pro,
if it wasn't for one thing.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.296
- PHOEBE:
You've never played.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.265
- Yeah, that's
the one thing.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.966
See ya.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.136
- I can't believe I finally
get to meet the famous Perry.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.006
- Yep, everybody
loves Perry the Great.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.708
But whenever he's around,
I become Cherry the Who?

01:16.710 --> 01:19.311
- You always say that.
It can't be that bad.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.012
- Oh, it's worse.

01:20.014 --> 01:22.648
One time our parents came to
pick us up from summer camp--

01:22.650 --> 01:24.349
took Perry home
and forgot me.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.585
- How far did they get
before they realized?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.053
- January.

01:28.055 --> 01:31.090
- Hey, Cherry!
- Hey, Coach Shimeck.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.625
- I wanna talk to you
about how well you did

01:33.627 --> 01:35.227
on your health class exam.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.129
- See? Nobody
forgot about you.

01:37.131 --> 01:41.700
- I'm so proud of--
Holy hockey sticks, it's Perry!

01:41.702 --> 01:45.070
- STUDENTS:
[chanting "Perry! Perry!"]

01:45.072 --> 01:46.371
- So, about my exam?

01:46.373 --> 01:47.172
- Who are you?

01:47.174 --> 01:50.442
- STUDENTS:
[chanting continues]

01:50.444 --> 01:51.210
- Right back at you.

01:51.212 --> 01:55.547
[chanting] Strangers!
Strangers! Strangers!

01:55.549 --> 01:56.215
Hey, Cherry.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.450
- Hey, Perry.
This is my bestie.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.487
- Hi. Um...I'm Boebe.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.554
Uh, Moebe.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.322
Phoebe.
[laughs]

02:03.324 --> 02:05.691
That's me.
It's nice to meet me.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.458
I mean, you.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.060
- It's very nice
to meet you.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.595
- [electrical zap]
- Whoa!

02:09.597 --> 02:10.462
Feel that spark?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.364
- It's called
static electricity.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.734
Here's your
hockey back. Bye.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.104
Do you see
what I'm talking about?

02:19.106 --> 02:19.805
He walks into a room

02:19.807 --> 02:21.740
and everything becomes
all about him.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.208
- Cherry, don't be silly.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.176
It's not all
about Perry.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.711
- COACH SHIMECK:
Attention, students!

02:25.713 --> 02:28.514
Perry is in the quad!
I repeat, Perry is in the quad!

02:28.516 --> 02:32.151
- STUDENTS:
[excited chatter]

02:37.558 --> 02:40.092
- So, you think
John Cena's your brother.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.494
That's interesting.

02:44.165 --> 02:47.099
- ¶

02:47.101 --> 02:48.100
- [bottles thud]

02:48.102 --> 02:49.535
- You guys are on fire!

02:49.537 --> 02:50.636
- What are
the kiddos up to?

02:50.638 --> 02:53.105
- Well, isn't it obvious?
They're...

02:53.107 --> 02:54.306
- [bottles thud]
- They're...

02:54.308 --> 02:57.276
Yeah, I have no idea
what they're doing.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.178
- We're bottle flipping.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.380
- Ha! Ah!
Bottle flipping.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.283
You know, I coulda gone pro,
if it wasn't for one thing.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.418
- You've never played.
- That's the one thing.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.388
So, explain this game
real quick, so I can beat ya.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.324
- First, you take a bottle
that's half full.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.560
Or is it half empty?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.762
Whoa-a-a-a-a...

03:18.265 --> 03:19.531
- Billy, stop. Nora, go.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.667
- The goal is to flip
the bottle into the air

03:21.669 --> 03:23.268
and have it
land upright...

03:23.270 --> 03:24.269
- [bottle thuds]
- ...like this.

03:24.271 --> 03:27.206
- Wow, you guys
are really talented.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.874
Why is this a thing?

03:28.876 --> 03:32.544
- Let's go look
it up online.

03:34.114 --> 03:37.683
- So, all you do is
toss a bottle in the air?

03:37.685 --> 03:38.650
How hard can that be?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.185
- Actually,
it's pretty hard.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.721
- Well, by the law of
older brothers,

03:42.723 --> 03:45.157
I'm better than you
at everything.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.825
- Oh, yeah?
Race you to Texas!

03:46.827 --> 03:50.262
[zooming]

03:50.264 --> 03:52.598
I win, pardner!

03:52.600 --> 03:55.734
- I meant better
than you at games.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.536
Observe.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.238
[exhales]

03:59.640 --> 04:00.772
- [bottle thuds]

04:00.774 --> 04:03.742
- You used to beat
them, buddy.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.612
[whooshing]

04:06.780 --> 04:08.513
- Billy, we've finally
found a game

04:08.515 --> 04:09.381
we're better at than Max.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.750
- Pssst! Yeah, right.
Not a chance.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.318
This table
isn't even level.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.555
- Fine. Then why don't you
try it at the kitchen island?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.290
- Sure.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.927
Watch and learn...

04:23.530 --> 04:24.596
- [bottle thuds]

04:24.598 --> 04:27.232
- ...that this island
is also not level.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.936
- It'll probably be impossible
for us to do this, then.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.337
- [bottles thud]

04:32.339 --> 04:33.705
- Boom!

04:33.707 --> 04:34.506
- [palm slap]

04:34.508 --> 04:36.875
- Stupid boom!
Stupid game!

04:36.877 --> 04:37.509
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.578
Is that mumbling
your way of saying

04:39.580 --> 04:40.779
we're better than you?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.481
- You will never
hear that.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.882
I'm takin' you down
to rematch town.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.550
- Oh, is that your
excuseville?

04:45.552 --> 04:47.452
- Race you to
excuseville!

04:47.454 --> 04:48.954
[zooming]

04:49.490 --> 04:52.190
- I don't know
where he's going, but...

04:52.192 --> 04:54.192
I hope he comes back.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.298
- Oh, Phoebe!

04:59.300 --> 05:02.701
You know how I love singing
while I eat ice cream.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.303
- Yes. I love
watching you

05:04.305 --> 05:05.737
and making sure
you don't choke.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.272
- Well, they just
opened up

05:07.274 --> 05:09.775
a new karaoke
ice cream club downtown.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.943
It's called...
I Scream, You Scream

05:11.945 --> 05:14.980
Really Loudly Into
a Microphone!

05:14.982 --> 05:16.715
- Cool. But there's
no microphone here,

05:16.717 --> 05:19.318
so you don't have
to scream yet.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.285
- Oh.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.321
Oh, my mom's calling.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.889
Hey, Mom.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.558
But, no, I don't wanna--

05:26.560 --> 05:27.259
Fine.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.929
[chanting]
Perry! Perry! Perry!

05:30.931 --> 05:32.464
- FEMALE VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

05:32.466 --> 05:34.566
Cherry's brother
Perry approaching.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.469
- Cherry's Perry?
Cherry's Perry?

05:37.471 --> 05:38.537
- Should I call a doctor?

05:38.539 --> 05:41.273
Your heart just
skipped a beat.

05:41.275 --> 05:41.873
- No.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.809
And "mute."
- [doorbell rings]

05:43.811 --> 05:45.811
- [monitor descends]

05:50.617 --> 05:52.751
- Oh, hey there.
[laughs]

05:52.753 --> 05:54.820
- Hey, Boebe Moebe.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.554
- Ha, ha, ha.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.422
So glad you remembered
me embarrassing myself.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.558
- Oh, no way.
It was super sweet.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.993
- Oh? Well,
in that case...

06:01.995 --> 06:04.429
follow Moebe.
[laughing]

06:04.431 --> 06:06.298
What's up?
You looking for Cherry?

06:06.300 --> 06:08.767
- Actually,
I came to see you.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.469
- Me? Why? Me?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.670
I mean...

06:11.672 --> 06:13.438
Cool. Cool. Cool.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.908
- I was wondering if you
wanna hang tomorrow night.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.611
Just us.
- Like a date?

06:19.613 --> 06:23.515
- Like a date.
- Like a yes.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.817
- Great.
See you tomorrow.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.719
- Okay.
[laughing]

06:31.425 --> 06:32.591
[squeals]

06:32.593 --> 06:33.859
She shoots, she scores!

06:33.861 --> 06:36.928
She takes out
the hockey words.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.000
- Did I hear Perry?
- Yeah, you just missed him.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.668
You'll never guess
what he wanted.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.438
- To ask you out.
- Wow, that's a good guess.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.305
- I knew it!

06:47.307 --> 06:49.007
I thought I saw him
being all flirty

06:49.009 --> 06:49.908
with you at school.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.376
And what did his
face look like

06:51.378 --> 06:53.979
when you said you
would never go out with him?

06:53.981 --> 06:56.615
- Uh...

06:56.617 --> 06:58.984
- Ooh, it was that bad?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.919
Oh, he must have
been so surprised

07:00.921 --> 07:03.622
that somebody
turned him down.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.024
- So surprised.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.794
- Thank you for not dating him.
- Yeah.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.595
- We both know
how that would go.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.365
- Yeah. I mean, I do,
but, well, how...

07:13.367 --> 07:16.067
how do you think
it would go?

07:17.438 --> 07:18.069
- You date Perry,

07:18.071 --> 07:19.638
he becomes all you
can think about,

07:19.640 --> 07:22.340
until you forget me,
like everyone else.

07:22.342 --> 07:22.841
- Oh...

07:22.843 --> 07:25.110
- Just the thought of
it breaks my heart.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.578
- Sure...well...

07:26.580 --> 07:29.714
it's a good thing
I turned down that date, then.

07:29.716 --> 07:30.982
- FEMALE VOICE:
Reminder.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.651
Phoebe has a date
tomorrow with--

07:32.653 --> 07:34.486
- I will unplug you!

07:34.488 --> 07:36.521
- [monitor descending]

07:36.523 --> 07:38.390
- ¶

07:38.392 --> 07:39.491
¶ What you see ¶

07:39.493 --> 07:40.926
¶ Is not what you get ¶

07:54.508 --> 07:55.941

07:55.943 --> 07:57.542

07:57.544 --> 07:59.411

08:05.586 --> 08:09.855
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

08:12.793 --> 08:14.993
- ¶

08:14.995 --> 08:15.727
- All right, Chloe,

08:15.729 --> 08:20.732
you ready for my world-famous
grilled cheese a la Hank?

08:20.734 --> 08:22.868
- Thanks, Daddy.

08:22.870 --> 08:23.902
Bye, Daddy.
[whooshing]

08:23.904 --> 08:25.871
- Chloe! One's for me!
One's for me!

08:25.873 --> 08:29.007
- I have a problem.
- Oh, honey, what's wrong?

08:29.009 --> 08:32.777
- Chloe stole my sandwich!
- Not you, our child.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.013
- Okay, so, Cherry's
brother came to town.

08:35.015 --> 08:35.847
- Yeah, we know.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.150
- BOTH: [chanting
Perry! Perry! Perry!]

08:39.152 --> 08:41.019
- Wait, you guys
are fans, too?

08:41.021 --> 08:43.455
- Yeah. #parents4perry.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.390
- Whoa-whoa!

08:45.392 --> 08:47.158
- Okay, well,
he asked me out,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.361
and then later Cherry
said not to date him,

08:49.363 --> 08:50.262
after I already said yes.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.430
- Well, why doesn't Cherry
want you to date him?

08:52.432 --> 08:55.166
- Well, she's felt overshadowed
by Perry her whole life,

08:55.168 --> 08:58.236
and now she's worried
that if I date him,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.771
I'll forget about
her, too.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.907
- Well, if Cherry's that
worried, you have to say no.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.408
- That was my initial
reaction, too,

09:03.410 --> 09:06.344
but then I thought, I could
just go on the date with Perry,

09:06.346 --> 09:08.747
and make sure I don't
forget about Cherry

09:08.749 --> 09:10.849
with the help of these.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.953
Cherry sunglasses.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.959
This Cherry-patterned dress,

09:20.961 --> 09:22.327
and...

09:22.329 --> 09:24.062
a bag of cherries.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.330
- Those are grapes.
- I know.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.033
Cherries are expensive.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.869
- Well, your plan sounds
like a great idea.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.803
- Really?
- Sure.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.472
If you wanna destroy your
friendship with Cherry.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.008
- I was afraid
you'd say that.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.511
Guess I was just trying
to fool myself.

09:39.513 --> 09:42.113
Okay, I will cancel
my date with Perry

09:42.115 --> 09:43.415
and hang out with
my best friend.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.083
- Oh, I'm proud of
you, Phoebe.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.552
But, uh, before you
break Perry's heart,

09:47.554 --> 09:51.356
could you get him
to sign this...

09:51.358 --> 09:53.959
and this...

09:53.961 --> 09:55.794
and this.
- Hank!

09:55.796 --> 09:59.497
- Don't forget
the hockey stick.

09:59.499 --> 10:03.835
- ¶

10:03.837 --> 10:07.505
- Okay, this is the one.
I can feel it.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.541
- [bottles thudding]

10:09.543 --> 10:12.510
- It's 'cause we're inside.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.112
- [whimsical music]

10:14.114 --> 10:15.280
- It's 'cause
we're outside.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.415
- [whimsical music
continues]

10:17.417 --> 10:20.118
- It's 'cause we're inside
after being outside.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.120
- [whimsical music
continues]

10:22.122 --> 10:26.391
- Wait, Max. I think
I know the problem.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.393
You're terrible!

10:28.395 --> 10:30.829
- Yeah, Max, you haven't
landed it 37 times.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.032
- Just admit that we're better
than you at bottle flipping.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.000
- Never!

10:35.002 --> 10:36.067
I know what
I'm doin' wrong.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.270
I'm flipping with
my fingers and not my wrist.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.305
I demand a rematch.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.140
- Unh, we're good.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.908
- What do you mean
you're good?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.176
- Well, we have
to end this

10:45.178 --> 10:47.879
while we still have a little
bit of respect for you.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.180
- Do we really
respect him?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.882
- [laughs]
Of course not.

10:50.884 --> 10:54.386
- Please play again.
- BOTH: Nope!

10:54.388 --> 10:57.956
- Uh, if I lose, you can
have whatever you want.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.157
- Really?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.025
- Yes, really.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.160
- We want what's
most precious to you

11:02.162 --> 11:03.895
in the entire world.

11:03.897 --> 11:04.562
- My lair?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.364
- I was gonna say your
hamburger pillow,

11:06.366 --> 11:08.600
but, sure, we'll
take the whole room.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.001
- Max, what are you doing?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.303
This is our playtime
buddy bunker.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.105
- Don't worry.
I'm gonna win.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.441
And when I do,
you two have to declare me

11:16.443 --> 11:18.309
the older brother
who's better than you--

11:18.311 --> 11:20.545
for ever and ever,
infinity!

11:20.547 --> 11:21.946
- BOTH:
Deal!

11:21.948 --> 11:24.315
- Wanna flip a coin
to see who goes first?

11:24.317 --> 11:27.218
Just kidding.
You stink at flipping.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.120
- If I stink...

11:29.122 --> 11:30.955
how could I...

11:30.957 --> 11:32.590
do this?

11:32.592 --> 11:35.093
- [dramatic music]

11:35.095 --> 11:37.996
¶

11:37.998 --> 11:39.330

11:39.332 --> 11:41.166
[clatters]

11:41.968 --> 11:44.269
- [electrical zapping]

11:45.539 --> 11:47.272
- Oh, no,
my lair's on fire!

11:47.274 --> 11:50.208
- You mean our
lair's on fire.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.943
- [blowing frosty air]

11:51.945 --> 11:54.379
- Thanks, Max. Now get
your stuff outta here.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.480
You have an hour.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.383
- You guys haven't
even flipped yet.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.286
- [bottles thud]

12:01.521 --> 12:03.655
- Fifty-nine minutes!

12:06.426 --> 12:10.662
- ¶

12:10.664 --> 12:13.565
- Hey, Phoebs.
- Hey, buddy.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.365
- [palm slap]

12:14.367 --> 12:15.467
- What are you
doing here?

12:15.469 --> 12:17.569
I thought our date wasn't
until later tonight.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.970
- Yeah, about that, um...

12:18.972 --> 12:20.972
I actually need to
call off our date.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.007
- Oh? That's
a bummer. Why?

12:23.009 --> 12:25.143
- Uh, it's a little
complicated, but, um...

12:25.145 --> 12:28.947
I think it would be better
if you and I were just friends.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.081
- Ouch.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.249
It feels weird
to get rejected

12:31.251 --> 12:33.651
in front of a "Congratulations
Perry" banner.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.520
- PHOEBE:
[laughs]

12:35.522 --> 12:37.489
- But, you know, I know
you have your reasons.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.390
- Thanks for understanding.
I've gotta run.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.660
I'm, uh, meeting Cherry
for ice cream and karaoke.

12:42.662 --> 12:43.528
- Have fun.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.664
I'm just gonna hang here
and eat this campfire sandwich.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.033
- Oh, graham crackers,
peanut butter,

12:49.035 --> 12:50.235
and toasted marshmallow.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.138
It's like having
a campfire in your mouth.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.406
Only safer.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.176
- Here. All yours.
- Yeah?

12:58.178 --> 12:58.743
[crunching]

12:58.745 --> 13:02.981
Oh, so good! I don't
suppose I can have some--

13:02.983 --> 13:04.415
- Hot cocoa?

13:04.417 --> 13:07.552
- Get out of my head!

13:07.554 --> 13:08.686
[laughing]
Thank you.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.122
Um, I'm gonna go ahead
and take these to go.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.692
I'm sorry, again, about
cancelling last minute.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.393
- No worries.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.595
It gives me time to watch
that new animated movie

13:17.597 --> 13:19.697
about books that
come to life.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.267
- Oh, "Finding Story."

13:22.269 --> 13:24.536
I've been wanting
to see that.

13:24.538 --> 13:25.436
- [movie music playing]

13:25.438 --> 13:28.573
- MALE NARRATOR:
A lot of people love books.

13:28.575 --> 13:32.443
But not a lot of people
know that books...

13:32.445 --> 13:36.114
...love.
- BOTH: Awwww...

13:36.116 --> 13:38.783
- ¶

13:38.785 --> 13:39.651
- Colosso, get up here!

13:39.653 --> 13:42.086
We lost the playtime
buddy bunker!

13:42.088 --> 13:43.721
- COLOSSO:
You lost it!

13:43.723 --> 13:47.425
- Okay, fine, I'm comin'
down there to get you.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.096
[heavy thud]

13:53.166 --> 13:57.268
I remember my bed
being less floor-like.

13:57.270 --> 14:02.207
- Welcome to the Billy and Nora
Better Than Max Museum,

14:02.209 --> 14:03.541
dedicated to kids everywhere

14:03.543 --> 14:07.278
who are better
than their older brothers.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.281
- Complimentary
water bottle?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.783
- Where's all my stuff?

14:11.785 --> 14:14.519
- Well, we need the space,
so, we hired a mover.

14:14.521 --> 14:18.356
- Let's hurry this up.
My truck's double-parked.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.791
[whooshing]

14:19.793 --> 14:22.093
- Whatever.
I don't need my stuff.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.127
I just need my rabbit.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.629
Come on, Colosso,
let's go.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.331
- I could go with you,

14:26.333 --> 14:28.666
or I could work
at the museum.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.236
By the way, could I see
your ticket, please?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.670
- I don't have a ticket.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.106
- Then get out!

14:35.108 --> 14:36.808
- Max, you can have
your lair back,

14:36.810 --> 14:40.378
if you admit what everyone
in this house already knows.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.512
- I will never say it.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.182
- Then you're not
welcome in our museum.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.450
- Chloe!

14:45.452 --> 14:46.517
- [whooshing]

14:46.519 --> 14:50.154
- I've got one last thing
for you to move outside.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.190
- You wouldn't dare.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.424
- [whooshing]

14:53.426 --> 14:56.227
- We dare!
- [palm slap]

14:58.298 --> 15:00.832
- MALE NARRATOR:
And that's when they knew...

15:00.834 --> 15:02.400
The End...

15:02.402 --> 15:05.270
was just The Beginning.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.804
- Oh, who would have thought

15:06.806 --> 15:09.274
an autobiography
and a mystery novel

15:09.276 --> 15:10.675
could fall in love.

15:10.677 --> 15:14.178
- Wanna watch it again
with Canadian subtitles?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.347
- You know, I can't
help but feeling like

15:16.349 --> 15:17.282
I'm forgetting something.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.651
- Like Cherry?
- Yes, like Cherry.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.552
Cherry!

15:21.554 --> 15:23.855
- Are you on a date
with my brother?

15:23.857 --> 15:25.290
- No!
- Yes!

15:25.292 --> 15:26.357
- No!
- Yes!

15:26.359 --> 15:28.359
- No!
- Yes!

15:28.361 --> 15:30.261
- Cherry, this is
not a date, okay?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.697
It's just two people eatin'
campfire sandwiches,

15:32.699 --> 15:35.433
watching a movie together
and snuggling.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.136
Oh, no, it's a date.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.342
- Cherry, the date was
an accident. I swear.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.645
- It was so romantic, sis.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.881
- Stop confusing her.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.684
- When you missed karaoke,
I checked everywhere for you.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.485
I had no idea you
were down here

15:54.487 --> 15:55.620
melting the ice
with my brother.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.356
- Cherry, listen, the only
reason I even came down here

15:58.358 --> 16:00.325
was to tell Perry
the date was off.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.393
- Off? When was it on?

16:02.395 --> 16:06.497
- Cherry, please
respect my girlfriend.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.732
- BOTH:
Quiet, Perry!

16:07.734 --> 16:10.935
- Maybe I'll just see you
both at the ceremony tomorrow.

16:10.937 --> 16:16.541
Would this be a weird time
for our first kiss?

16:16.543 --> 16:18.076
- Yes!

16:20.547 --> 16:22.814
Cherry, I'm sorry,
but this really

16:22.816 --> 16:24.716
is all just
some big mistake.

16:24.718 --> 16:25.483
- Mistake?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.652
There must have
been some part of you

16:27.654 --> 16:29.354
that wanted to date him.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.021
- Yeah, maybe so.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.023
But now there's a much
bigger part of me

16:32.025 --> 16:33.658
that completely
regrets it.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.393
- After everything
I told you about

16:35.395 --> 16:36.527
feeling overshadowed
by Perry,

16:36.529 --> 16:39.664
you forgot about me,
just like everyone else.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.665
- Wait, Cherry--
- No!

16:40.667 --> 16:46.604
I am sick of everyone being
wrapped up in Perry fever!

16:50.543 --> 16:53.878
Now I'm wrapped up
in Perry fever!

16:56.416 --> 16:58.816
- ¶

16:58.818 --> 17:01.419
- [wind gusting]
- See? This is great.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.887
Who needs a lair, anyway?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.722
- COLOSSO:
[shivering]

17:04.724 --> 17:08.459
Yeah, or feeling
in our toes.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.096
- Max, the weatherman
says a storm is coming.

17:12.098 --> 17:12.964
- Yeah, just come inside

17:12.966 --> 17:14.999
and tell your
baby brother and sister

17:15.001 --> 17:16.067
they're better than you.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.902
- They're not
better than me!

17:17.904 --> 17:19.771
[powers whooshing]

17:22.575 --> 17:23.708
We'll stay out here

17:23.710 --> 17:25.943
for the rest of our lives,
if we have to.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.980
Right, Colosso?
- [crickets chirping]

17:28.982 --> 17:30.148
- Colosso?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.849
- [tapping on window]

17:31.851 --> 17:34.452
Sucker!
[laughing]

17:34.454 --> 17:35.953
- Traitor!

17:35.955 --> 17:39.123
At least I still have
my sturdy fort.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.125
- [wind gusting]

17:43.029 --> 17:45.797
- You, too, fort?

17:45.799 --> 17:46.931
Stay strong, Max.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.835
- [thunder crashing]

17:50.837 --> 17:53.071
- Oh, who am I kidding?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.872
I'm an indoor hero!

17:54.874 --> 17:57.508
- [rain spattering,
thunder crashing]

17:57.510 --> 17:59.977
- [knocking on door]
Let me in! It's pouring!

17:59.979 --> 18:03.147
- You know what
we wanna hear.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.016
Say it.
- Fine.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.753
You guys are extremely
lucky at bottle flipping.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.022
- [thunder crashing]
- Jeez!

18:11.024 --> 18:13.057
I'll really say
it this time.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.492
[panting]

18:14.494 --> 18:17.128
You guys are better than
me at bottle flipping, okay?

18:17.130 --> 18:20.465
My little brother and sister
are better than me.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.537
- They broke you, baby.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.640
- Why didn't you just say
we were better to begin with?

18:29.642 --> 18:32.510
- I don't know.
I'm older. I'm supposed to win.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.913
But, I guess you guys
can win, too,

18:35.915 --> 18:39.650
sometimes, or whatever.
Ugh, gross.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.185
- Well, you've
suffered enough.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.788
You can have
your lair back.

18:44.924 --> 18:48.926
- Sheesh, I never should have
played this stupid game.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.862
- [bottle thuds]

18:50.864 --> 18:53.931
- Guys! I did it!
I landed one!

18:53.933 --> 18:55.733
- Didn't see it.
- Either did I.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.602
- It's getting sad.

18:59.272 --> 19:03.074
- [sobbing]
No-o-o-o-o-o!

19:03.076 --> 19:06.110
- ¶

19:06.112 --> 19:08.179
- There you go.
Anything for my fans.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.681
- Oooh! Oh, wait, wait.
Just one more thing.

19:10.683 --> 19:14.018
- Dude, you said that
eight things ago.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.724
- Cherry, will you
stop ignoring me.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.093
Come on. If I could go
back and do it again,

19:22.095 --> 19:23.861
I never would have
missed karaoke with you.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.963
- Well, you forgot me
and you can't unforget

19:25.965 --> 19:28.099
what you forgot,
so, forget it.

19:28.101 --> 19:31.569
- Cherry, there has to
be something I can do.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.604
- I think you've
done enough.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.239
[sighs]

19:35.241 --> 19:37.842
- Honey, everything
okay with Cherry?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.777
- No, she's mad at me.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.079
I think I know what
I need to do

19:42.081 --> 19:43.915
to make it up to her.

19:43.917 --> 19:44.982
- [heavy sigh]

19:44.984 --> 19:46.884
She dated Perry,
didn't she?

19:46.886 --> 19:49.554
- Who can blame her?

19:52.292 --> 19:55.159
- I'm Coach Shimeck,
and you're all here to honor

19:55.161 --> 19:59.864
the best hockey player to ever
grace the Hiddenville ice!

19:59.866 --> 20:02.600
- CROWD: [chanting
Perry! Perry! Perry!]

20:02.602 --> 20:04.769
- We all know his name!

20:04.771 --> 20:08.940
- It's time to hear
from the one, the only--

20:08.942 --> 20:10.675
- Hello, I'm
Phoebe Thunderman.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.743
Um, I know we're all
here to honor Perry,

20:12.745 --> 20:15.046
but, first, I have a few
things I need to say

20:15.048 --> 20:16.781
about the MVP
in my life.

20:16.783 --> 20:20.318
- She means her
Most Valuable Perry.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.620
- No, I mean Cherry.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.689
- All right, can I have
the microphone back?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.357
- Look, I know
I forgot our plans,

20:26.359 --> 20:28.226
but I would never
forget about you.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.294
All of my favorite
memories are with you.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.762
Like...like when
I moved here,

20:31.764 --> 20:33.664
you were the first
person to talk to me.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.234
- Okay, that's enough
non-Perry stuff!

20:36.236 --> 20:37.068
- Sorry. Wait.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.302
Remember that time you
thought I was sick,

20:38.304 --> 20:41.205
so, you pretended to be me
and went to all my classes.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.274
But it turns out
it was a Saturday.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.611
- Go, microphone, now!

20:49.916 --> 20:51.949
- Like the time I was
having a bad hair day

20:51.951 --> 20:53.951
and you didn't want
me to feel alone,

20:53.953 --> 20:55.753
so, you shaved
your whole head.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.655
- COACH SHIMECK:
Run!

20:58.992 --> 21:00.925
- Or the time Madison
wore the same dress

21:00.927 --> 21:03.327
as me to the dance,
so, you shaved her head.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.795
- [screaming]

21:04.797 --> 21:06.964
[heavy thud]

21:11.904 --> 21:14.372
- Remember the time we snuck
out to that concert and--

21:14.374 --> 21:17.208
Nope. Parents are here.
Never mind.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.943
- Give me that!

21:18.945 --> 21:20.011
- The point is, Cherry,

21:20.013 --> 21:22.113
I'm so lucky to have
you as my best friend,

21:22.115 --> 21:23.981
and there's nothing
in this world

21:23.983 --> 21:26.150
that could ever make
me forget you.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.352
- Oh, Phoebe.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.687
I forgive you.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.688
- That was amazing.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.325
Now this is the perfect
time for our first kiss.

21:35.061 --> 21:38.362
- Oh, sweet,
simple Perry...

21:38.364 --> 21:41.098
we can't be together.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.367
I choose Cherry.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.035
- Huh?

21:44.037 --> 21:47.104
I could really use a cheer
up chant right now.

21:47.106 --> 21:52.777
- CROWD: [chanting
Perry! Perry! Perry! Perry!]

21:56.082 --> 21:58.115
- Looks like they
forgot both of us.

21:58.117 --> 21:58.983
- It doesn't matter--

21:58.985 --> 22:00.951
as long as we never
forget each other.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.120
- What was that part
about sneaking out

22:03.122 --> 22:05.356
to go to a concert?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.391
- BOTH:
We forget!

22:12.332 --> 22:24.575
- ¶
