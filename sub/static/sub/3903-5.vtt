00:12.400 --> 00:13.500
My man.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.700
Ain't but $290 here.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.460
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy…

00:53.500 --> 00:55.360
a kickback's supposed to be $500.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.800
Stash got hit, yo.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.266
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!

01:02.300 --> 01:05.336
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.100
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!

01:09.500 --> 01:14.560
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.108
You gonna see who you're fucking with!

01:18.400 --> 01:20.380
Do I look like a fucking punk?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
Yo, shorty.

01:25.300 --> 01:29.062
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.374
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?

01:39.100 --> 01:41.200
Fuck, this is bad shit!

01:43.400 --> 01:45.400
Fuck, this is really bad.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.500
Shit.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.916
Get your ass out that car.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.000
All right!

01:53.300 --> 01:54.200
Shut up.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.000
Where the money at? Check his socks.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.860
You got something for me here, Zig?

02:02.900 --> 02:05.200
You got some dough for me, man?

02:05.700 --> 02:07.900
Jesus, jackpot.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.300
Man, hold up, man.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.560
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.160
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know….

02:18.200 --> 02:20.642
What the fuck you think this is, man?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.260
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?

02:24.300 --> 02:26.500
Is that what you think, man?

02:31.400 --> 02:34.200
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.500
Yeah, I know it did.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.000
All right, look, how about the coat?

02:39.100 --> 02:40.750
Take the coat, all right?

02:43.300 --> 02:45.600
I paid two large for it…

02:45.700 --> 02:48.700
so that, plus the cash I gave you…

02:48.800 --> 02:52.232
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.900
You know I will!

02:55.000 --> 02:57.574
You know right there, you can fix that.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.800
$2,000?

03:00.600 --> 03:01.500
For this?

03:03.900 --> 03:05.960
Not even a black man could style that shit.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.980
You know what I'm saying, man?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.216
What you laughing at, man?

03:13.100 --> 03:16.060
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.

03:16.100 --> 03:20.360
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!

03:20.400 --> 03:24.624
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.000
Yo, take my man's ride.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.200
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!

03:49.900 --> 03:51.100
Fuck you!

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Why me?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.366
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.506
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.046
I'm not saying I don't want it.

05:49.100 --> 05:53.360
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.512
Yeah, I thought about that, too.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.160
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster…

06:00.200 --> 06:01.800
I'm saying to myself:

06:02.000 --> 06:04.904
“Why take a man
who already burned you once…

06:06.800 --> 06:09.242
who already proved himself disloyal?”

06:10.000 --> 06:11.700
Now, why would I do that?

06:15.300 --> 06:17.610
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.300
Because if I caught him once…

06:23.800 --> 06:27.232
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.260
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time…

06:31.300 --> 06:33.280
so that it won't happen again.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.900
No, sir, it won't.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.300
One other thing…

06:39.600 --> 06:42.960
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.360
Your paycheck may say “sergeant,”
but on this detail…

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
Det. Greggs runs your team.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.700
Same as it ever was.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
Well?

07:26.900 --> 07:27.800
I'm in.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.360
Come here, you sweet bitch.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
Motherfu—

07:33.800 --> 07:36.044
Don't be grabbing my Dick, faggot.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.960
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.400
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.000
Summit Silver 450.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.848
Top of the line, right here.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.400
Over there?

08:07.700 --> 08:08.900
Yo, Bubs.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.700
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.900
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.100
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?

08:24.300 --> 08:27.336
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me…

08:27.800 --> 08:31.298
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.600
What the hell is that?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.799
A Baltimore knot.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.659
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?

08:40.700 --> 08:43.960
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.168
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.768
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?

08:50.800 --> 08:53.060
That's old business. You remember Bird?

08:53.100 --> 08:56.994
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.060
He said you can reach him
here at this number.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.684
You can leave a message.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.400
Good work, Bubs.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.000
As always. Here.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.500
Cab fare.

09:19.500 --> 09:23.658
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.060
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about…

09:27.100 --> 09:29.760
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.160
I mean, what the fuck, man?

09:31.200 --> 09:35.260
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.800
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf…

09:39.400 --> 09:43.624
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.600
Why? He play you hard?

09:47.300 --> 09:48.900
I go at him respectable…

09:49.000 --> 09:51.560
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.760
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel…

09:53.800 --> 09:56.704
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.860
I damn near pissed in my pants…

09:58.900 --> 10:01.160
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.400
It ain't funny.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.768
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things…

10:06.200 --> 10:08.360
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:

10:08.400 --> 10:11.304
“Good work, bubs,” and a little bit of this.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.100
For your pains.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.760
Where are we at with the Jane Does?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.660
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons…

10:21.700 --> 10:24.660
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.560
How's the port police broad
working out for us?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.060
She knows the docks okay.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.600
No detective, though.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.160
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.460
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.348
You're detailed temporarily.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.800
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over…

10:44.900 --> 10:48.596
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?

10:49.800 --> 10:53.360
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.690
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.300
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.200
How's it feel?

11:10.100 --> 11:14.258
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.760
The deck has a harbor view?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.400
Yes, in two directions.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.536
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.942
–This ain't Federal Hill.
–Excuse me?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.860
This is the Point, Locust Point.

11:26.900 --> 11:31.600
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street…

11:31.700 --> 11:34.760
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.160
Are you two house hunting?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.400
We just started.

11:37.500 --> 11:41.160
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.860
–This particular house—
–Is my aunt Treesey's.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.800
Really, your aunt?
Is she a relation to the McDonalds?

11:49.300 --> 11:51.500
Nope. She's a relation to me.

11:51.900 --> 11:56.520
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.600
Is that the price?

11:58.700 --> 12:00.700
That's the listing, yes.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.660
They ain't gonna get that much, right?

12:09.700 --> 12:12.660
I can't say for certain, but one just like it…

12:12.700 --> 12:15.802
in the 1 200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.300
$340,000?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
–Thanks.
–Yeah.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.000
Maybe we should rent.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.960
We're here because Valchek wants us here…

12:44.000 --> 12:47.260
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local…

12:47.300 --> 12:48.554
has too much money.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.460
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs…

12:51.500 --> 12:52.960
on the union hall phones.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.360
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.660
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it…

12:59.700 --> 13:01.560
and buy ourselves a little time.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.960
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.660
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night…

13:06.700 --> 13:08.960
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.160
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?

13:11.200 --> 13:13.660
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.760
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy…

13:15.800 --> 13:18.760
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?

13:18.800 --> 13:22.700
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.510
I'll show you how it's done, homes.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.400
Cool Lester smooth.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.000
What's happening?

13:31.700 --> 13:34.700
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail…

13:34.800 --> 13:37.660
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.260
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?

13:40.300 --> 13:43.560
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.460
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.460
–Then we did you a favor.
–I wouldn't go that far.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.348
But fuck it. Who we chasing?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.100
Frank Sobotka?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.360
–How fucking good is he?
–You know the man?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.860
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week…

14:01.900 --> 14:04.060
working that case about
dead girls in the container.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.100
He a suspect?

14:05.200 --> 14:08.360
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.860
–Why are you on him?
–My father-in-law hates his guts.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.260
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.676
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.900
So you're thinking drugs?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.768
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?

14:23.000 --> 14:26.060
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just…

14:26.100 --> 14:28.300
with Terrell being sick and all….

14:29.300 --> 14:33.000
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.860
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up…

14:36.900 --> 14:38.880
with something out of the mix.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.568
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.860
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it…

14:45.900 --> 14:48.210
and give back some time for family.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.800
For you and me and Terrell.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.700
Family?

14:53.300 --> 14:56.204
They thinking about
how they can do for you.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.248
They making all these plans…

14:58.300 --> 15:01.600
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.700
Stringer says so, anyhow.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.900
Why you be like that?

15:09.200 --> 15:12.360
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.560
They playing you with that
“We're family, and it's all about love.”

15:15.600 --> 15:16.760
That's how they do.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.760
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.044
It's just about business, Donette.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.000
Dee, they gonna be there for us.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.360
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.860
–You know Stony got that check.
–Slow down, fool.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.860
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.960
–Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
–I ain't got no ends.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.360
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.100
No, I ain't say that.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.500
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.200
–Fuck you all.
–Yeah, motherfucker?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.000
Yo, B.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.612
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.300
Damn.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.300
What the fuck was that?

16:31.400 --> 16:34.360
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.660
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?

16:36.700 --> 16:41.386
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.474
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.706
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.000
Zig, what's up?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.310
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.117
Fucking niggers got me.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.200
What?

17:17.300 --> 17:19.960
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.260
You hear me? They got my fucking car.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.160
If I had a gun, I swear to God…

17:24.200 --> 17:26.760
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.800
–You call the cops?
–Can't.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.700
It was over some dope.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.006
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?

17:35.700 --> 17:37.944
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.900
From who? White Mike?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.760
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.770
–A few ounces, you know?
–Why not White Mike?

17:51.800 --> 17:54.200
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.000
Why the fuck would I know how he be?

17:59.800 --> 18:03.900
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.

18:04.300 --> 18:08.600
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.792
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.260
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.760
And now they're telling me…

18:17.800 --> 18:21.892
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.400
I need $2,700.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
So?

18:29.200 --> 18:32.434
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.838
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?

18:46.600 --> 18:48.514
I ain't giving you the money.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.000
They're gonna kill me.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.100
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.696
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.648
I ain't got it for you, Zig.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.700
You cocksuckers.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.300
–Major in?
–Yeah, just knock.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.500
Yeah?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.360
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.760
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.

20:05.800 --> 20:09.700
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.600
Okay.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.700
Fuck with my ass, will you?

20:22.900 --> 20:26.600
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.506
All right, your research papers are here.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.300
Remember Friday, take-home test.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.600
Well done, Mr Bell.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.660
–Mr Lucas, you got five minutes?
–Absolutely.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.360
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
I'll try.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.760
What are the options
when you got an inferior product…

20:54.800 --> 20:56.800
in an aggressive marketplace?

20:57.300 --> 21:01.260
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.600
And if you don't?

21:03.300 --> 21:05.660
Reduce price to increase market share.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.360
That assumes low overhead.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.960
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss…

21:10.000 --> 21:12.700
and worse, as your prices drop…

21:13.200 --> 21:16.566
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.

21:16.700 --> 21:21.122
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.760
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.300
–So he proposed—
–To change the name?

21:28.800 --> 21:29.800
Exactly.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.400
Which one?

21:45.900 --> 21:47.460
He's got a weenie in his hand.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.700
On this case, ain't that you?

21:54.800 --> 21:58.100
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.660
What the fuck is that?

22:00.700 --> 22:02.200
Grand jury summons.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.700
Grand jury?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.560
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.800
You lie to them, it's perjury.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.628
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.800
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?

22:20.100 --> 22:22.500
That's John Spamanato right there.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.300
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.200
Johnny Fifty?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.700
What the fuck is that?

22:31.900 --> 22:35.260
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.

22:35.300 --> 22:39.500
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.298
“Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City.”

22:44.300 --> 22:46.742
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?

22:46.900 --> 22:48.760
Everybody on that ship testifies.

22:48.800 --> 22:49.900
About what?

22:50.100 --> 22:51.948
About them girls in the can.

22:52.900 --> 22:56.060
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.260
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock…

22:58.300 --> 23:01.138
in a box, dying there in the dark because….

23:03.500 --> 23:05.700
Because why, Detective?

23:07.500 --> 23:10.960
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?

23:11.000 --> 23:15.554
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?

23:16.000 --> 23:19.100
I got a wife and three sisters.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.100
And they got daughters.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.860
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off…

23:24.900 --> 23:26.460
at what's in your heads right now.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.860
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.760
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!

23:31.800 --> 23:34.560
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!

23:34.600 --> 23:37.560
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.960
I take the fifth commandment.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.360
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.360
–I don't remember.
–Don't remember what?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.500
Nothing.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.060
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S local on the East Coast…

23:50.100 --> 23:53.560
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.860
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.060
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.960
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon…

24:04.600 --> 24:08.360
Ronnie “The Union Buster” Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.898
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!

24:20.500 --> 24:22.546
These four ain't working today.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.560
You wanna leave the papers here…

24:25.600 --> 24:29.098
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.100
Come on.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.300
–Today?
–Now!

24:48.800 --> 24:51.060
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr Gant…

24:51.100 --> 24:53.000
as a.380 semi-automatic.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.960
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:

24:57.000 --> 25:00.100
“Australian, or one of those "A" countries.”

25:00.800 --> 25:02.000
Is that correct?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.200
Indeed.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.860
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?

25:06.900 --> 25:09.400
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.260
Mr Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine…

25:13.300 --> 25:14.860
who manufactured the weapon?

25:14.900 --> 25:16.200
I wasn't.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.260
Then how were you able
to relate that information…

25:19.300 --> 25:20.700
to the detectives?

25:21.900 --> 25:23.400
Bird showed it to me.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.338
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?

25:30.300 --> 25:31.900
Which murder we talking?

25:32.700 --> 25:35.076
Bird committed more than one murder?

25:36.300 --> 25:38.960
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.160
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody…

25:42.200 --> 25:44.642
talking about this deed and the next.

25:44.800 --> 25:49.460
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.

25:49.500 --> 25:53.100
Mr Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside…

25:53.200 --> 25:55.972
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.100
I thought he did good.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.460
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me…

26:10.500 --> 26:12.876
putting that sociopath on the stand.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.960
You got to admit, it'll be different.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.452
Dress him up at least.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.668
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.300
Here's a voucher for court clothes.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.400
Anything with a tie.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.000
I'm saying, Dirt…

26:44.200 --> 26:46.760
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.700
You see what I'm saying, yo?

26:48.800 --> 26:50.300
Well, I'll be.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.260
All the time I be telling you, be on post.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.660
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib…

26:56.700 --> 26:59.160
trying to play house with them bitches.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.260
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here…

27:02.300 --> 27:05.270
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?

27:05.700 --> 27:08.060
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?

27:08.100 --> 27:09.660
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.198
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
How'd we do, Charlie?

27:21.100 --> 27:26.360
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.300
They don't scare, them guys.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.100
What now?

27:33.000 --> 27:36.432
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.100
A Cl?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.000
An informant.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.740
You ain't got no informants on the dock?

27:45.300 --> 27:49.524
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?

27:53.200 --> 27:56.632
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.314
Meaning, we ain't about much.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.800
The voucher says $150.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.082
Look on the clearance rack.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.100
–It's a look.
–No, it ain't.

28:19.900 --> 28:24.660
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.944
I'll see you in about a half-hour.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.884
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.

28:35.700 --> 28:38.802
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.400
Where's he at?

28:47.500 --> 28:49.612
Said he had to go get his props.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.500
1 2-08.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
12-08.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.300
Request lateral with 1 2-10.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.800
KGA, he can meet me on 6.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.200
Do you copy, 12-08?

29:06.300 --> 29:08.000
10-4, on 6.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.560
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?

29:12.600 --> 29:17.022
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.244
What's up? You need a little help?

29:30.600 --> 29:33.060
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?

29:33.100 --> 29:35.212
–You got it to spend?
–For sure.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.824
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.160
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.800
All in the props.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.800
Feel any different? Me neither.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.160
–Special Agent Cleary.
–Jim McNulty, from the city.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.700
How can I help you?

30:17.800 --> 30:19.760
Found floating off the Key Bridge.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.460
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.360
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.900
–Homicide fellows.
–Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.860
–Yeah, you working with them?
–Sort of, I fished her out.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.760
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.600
You're kidding, right?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.660
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know…

30:40.700 --> 30:43.660
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.800
Step into my world, Virginia.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.600
A grand jury?

30:54.300 --> 30:57.560
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.300
But you know nothing.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.360
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.960
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse…

31:05.000 --> 31:07.508
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.200
You sure?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.100
Horse is a rock.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.370
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.

31:20.500 --> 31:23.000
But you say he wants to stop.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.500
Yeah, for a little while.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.160
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks…

31:28.200 --> 31:30.312
at least until this shit chills.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.646
These were local police, right?

31:32.700 --> 31:33.700
Yeah.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.760
Their interest is in the girls.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.260
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.

31:38.300 --> 31:39.500
A dead end.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.960
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.600
Another dead end.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.614
The police are going nowhere.

31:48.200 --> 31:53.000
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.960
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.640
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.866
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.

32:04.900 --> 32:06.900
Says he wants the Greek.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.478
Says you tell him when and where.

32:09.800 --> 32:10.900
Niko.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.572
About that other business, the chemicals….

32:20.100 --> 32:21.816
What do you need them for?

32:22.400 --> 32:26.096
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.900
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.700
Yeah?

32:31.900 --> 32:34.936
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?

32:39.200 --> 32:41.860
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?

32:41.900 --> 32:43.360
Maryland and Delaware only.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.560
Any of them still in your custody?

32:45.600 --> 32:48.160
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.960
Everyone in that book was deported.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.160
You can guess,
some of them are already back.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.708
Any field office have anything active?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.660
That's what I'm looking at right here.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.160
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.660
Anything I can drive to?

33:01.700 --> 33:04.460
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.960
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 1 2 in their bullpen four days ago.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.200
That'll work.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.260
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?

33:14.300 --> 33:15.752
I'll take a day, yeah.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.978
What's between you and this girl?

33:18.800 --> 33:23.288
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?

33:23.900 --> 33:24.800
I have.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.900
Mau. How you been?

33:37.300 --> 33:39.500
–Same old.
–Yeah?

33:40.200 --> 33:42.000
You getting some days?

33:42.400 --> 33:43.500
Pretty much.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.600
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.200
You want to come in?

33:51.500 --> 33:55.394
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.592
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.100
Let me get my jacket.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.702
So I tell him,
“Dee, why you acting like that?”

34:14.900 --> 34:18.134
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.400
He off the damn hook.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.576
You tell him about the plans, right?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.659
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.

34:30.699 --> 34:34.396
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.199
He knows some.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.896
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?

34:46.600 --> 34:50.199
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend…

34:51.000 --> 34:53.760
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.900
He say just leave him alone.

34:59.100 --> 35:02.796
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.100
Little Donette know how to burn.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.710
Your father bucking us, little man.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.400
What you think about that?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
Yeah. I think you're right.

35:27.300 --> 35:28.700
What you looking at?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.900
Fucking Ziggy, man.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.460
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?

35:36.500 --> 35:38.460
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.008
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.

35:46.700 --> 35:47.800
What's up?

35:47.900 --> 35:49.880
Came to see a man about a car.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.714
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.100
Yo, Cheese. White boy.

36:03.300 --> 36:05.200
Yo, you got my money, man?

36:06.100 --> 36:08.344
That's what we came to talk about.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.360
Yo, you got to a lot of heart…

36:10.400 --> 36:12.660
coming up in here
without my fucking money.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.060
We thought maybe
we can work something out…

36:15.100 --> 36:16.760
so you can get what's yours.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.384
How you plan to do that?

36:18.400 --> 36:21.160
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.

36:21.200 --> 36:24.560
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.000
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.

36:29.100 --> 36:32.260
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much…

36:32.300 --> 36:34.808
I'll give the boy another week to pay.

36:36.900 --> 36:41.500
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.300
You don't believe me?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.600
Have a look.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.958
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.100
And you counted on that?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.784
Who else am I gonna ask?

37:22.800 --> 37:24.516
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.046
Not even for you am I a snitch.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.600
I'm not thinking about it like that.

37:30.200 --> 37:34.700
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together…

37:34.800 --> 37:38.460
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it…

37:38.500 --> 37:39.860
he's still a good guy…

37:39.900 --> 37:42.078
someone I can talk to about this.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.200
How come it didn't go nowhere?

37:51.300 --> 37:53.300
You did good. Who knows?

37:53.800 --> 37:56.800
I don't know, you never know.

38:00.900 --> 38:04.960
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.980
All of a sudden, you're a cop.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.400
Help me with this, Mau.

38:12.100 --> 38:16.390
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?

38:18.900 --> 38:21.260
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.460
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off…

38:24.500 --> 38:26.810
looking for someone to clue you in…

38:27.500 --> 38:30.300
when a lot of what you're asking about…

38:31.000 --> 38:32.980
is right there for the taking.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.100
How so?

38:36.000 --> 38:40.260
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?

38:40.300 --> 38:43.400
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.460
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems…

38:47.500 --> 38:49.600
then that paper gets tossed.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.700
That don't happen today, right?

38:54.100 --> 38:56.100
Nothing gets tossed anymore.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.800
The computer.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.800
Thanks, Mau.

39:31.300 --> 39:32.300
Well?

39:35.200 --> 39:37.100
Good news and bad, Zig.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.300
Those fucking niggers.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.200
Give me the bad.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.996
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.800
What the fuck can be good?

39:51.900 --> 39:54.300
You can cancel your car insurance.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.500
Let me get two red tops.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.400
There we go.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.078
I hope you guys are taking notes.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.600
Shit.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.900
One-and-one.

41:14.900 --> 41:19.454
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.830
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.500
A talk would ease his mind.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.700
Ease my mind first.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.244
This business with the grand jury.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.860
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.800
Just the regular panels.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.760
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.900
–And?
–Nobody talks.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.700
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.

42:05.100 --> 42:07.608
It is more attention than he expected.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.110
He will need money for his lawyers.

42:10.600 --> 42:14.500
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.

42:15.500 --> 42:16.900
Let the money talk.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.760
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.360
Each one weaker than the other.

42:24.400 --> 42:27.260
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.

42:27.300 --> 42:29.660
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers…

42:29.700 --> 42:33.360
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.000
Who got the good shit?

42:35.200 --> 42:36.200
Eastside.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.100
Eastside, who?

42:38.300 --> 42:41.700
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe…

42:41.800 --> 42:44.860
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.

42:44.900 --> 42:47.500
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.560
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime…

42:49.600 --> 42:52.060
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.000
Damn!

42:53.300 --> 42:58.778
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.700
I hear you, man, I'm on it.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.548
You working it out with Dee?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.848
Boy got to find his own way.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.786
I'm saying, you know…

43:13.800 --> 43:15.960
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.860
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.760
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.978
He has something to come home to.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.300
Do it.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.960
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?

43:32.000 --> 43:35.366
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't I?

43:37.800 --> 43:39.400
You've been fair.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.600
Too fair.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.700
–Where's the Greek?
–He sent me.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.618
Fuck you, and fuck him.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.960
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee…

44:02.000 --> 44:03.660
to help with any legal troubles.

44:03.700 --> 44:05.560
He also told me to tell you he regrets…

44:05.600 --> 44:08.768
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.

44:11.100 --> 44:13.460
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars…

44:13.500 --> 44:16.600
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?

44:17.500 --> 44:19.200
I'm done. I'm out.

44:19.300 --> 44:21.160
I need nothing more to do with you people.

44:21.200 --> 44:25.160
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.600
They used to make steel there, no?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.900
Smoke from the stacks.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.200
But inside….

45:05.300 --> 45:06.818
Potassium permanganate.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.200
Spell “permanganate.”

45:10.300 --> 45:12.800
F-U-C-K.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.360
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?

45:21.400 --> 45:23.800
I'm in the checker's local, right?

45:23.900 --> 45:26.144
You know, while you Local 47 boys…

45:26.200 --> 45:28.560
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads…

45:28.600 --> 45:31.504
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.026
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?

45:43.000 --> 45:44.500
Let me ask you:

45:45.100 --> 45:47.060
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?

45:47.100 --> 45:48.760
If they want it, they want it.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.260
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon…

45:51.300 --> 45:53.000
I'm fucking toasted.

46:04.100 --> 46:06.560
I don't know who you've been talking to…

46:06.600 --> 46:09.860
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.

46:09.900 --> 46:12.200
–It's not like the old days.
–No?

46:13.300 --> 46:16.600
A little here and there,
but for the most part…

46:16.700 --> 46:19.500
the new technology
has changed everything.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.360
Look, see this little box right here?

46:25.400 --> 46:26.460
You fucking mind?

46:26.500 --> 46:28.560
Ring's a little stressed right now…

46:28.600 --> 46:31.760
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks…

46:31.800 --> 46:34.960
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.100
Bite me.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.060
–Frank, these officers are—
–I know who they are.

46:39.100 --> 46:40.860
Frank here helped set this system up.

46:40.900 --> 46:43.960
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.600
No problem, chief.

46:47.400 --> 46:50.800
In a nutshell, what this shows…

46:50.900 --> 46:53.100
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.

46:53.900 --> 46:56.300
The plan calls for 85 moves.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.860
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.060
Now, look at the screen.

47:01.100 --> 47:04.360
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record…

47:04.400 --> 47:06.908
and puts it in the permanent database.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.260
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.460
Did our port manager tell you
that right now…

47:12.500 --> 47:16.262
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?

47:16.500 --> 47:18.860
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis…

47:18.900 --> 47:20.700
we came up 300 light?

47:20.800 --> 47:23.460
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.600
160?

47:24.700 --> 47:26.160
Not that all of them are stolen.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.260
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.

47:28.300 --> 47:33.000
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.660
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there…

47:35.700 --> 47:37.160
sometimes waves get knocked down.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.960
That happens, a can don't get entered.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.660
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.

47:41.700 --> 47:47.160
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.

47:47.200 --> 47:50.830
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.200
So imagine February on the docks.

47:53.300 --> 47:56.560
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.660
You're saying
that's what happened to the can…

47:58.700 --> 48:00.300
with the girls in it?

48:00.400 --> 48:03.460
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.

48:03.500 --> 48:05.560
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer…

48:05.600 --> 48:07.860
it might look like
there's some dirt going down…

48:07.900 --> 48:10.060
when it's really just a glitch in the system.

48:10.100 --> 48:14.522
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?

48:14.600 --> 48:17.900
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.

48:18.100 --> 48:21.070
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.

48:22.500 --> 48:25.160
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.

48:25.200 --> 48:28.460
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.272
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.998
–Frank give you everything you need?
–He did, thanks.

48:39.700 --> 48:41.400
They're playing us.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.760
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?

48:50.800 --> 48:52.560
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.360
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?

48:55.400 --> 48:58.260
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.

48:58.300 --> 49:01.060
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.

49:01.100 --> 49:03.060
–Where do you hold them?
–County detention.

49:03.100 --> 49:05.806
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.100
You all heard of WorldCom?

49:10.400 --> 49:12.400
All right, let's try this.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.000
You all get jacked by some knockos.

49:15.700 --> 49:16.888
But you all clean.

49:16.900 --> 49:19.760
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.300
What do you do?

49:25.200 --> 49:26.800
Give another name.

49:26.900 --> 49:27.900
Why?

49:30.400 --> 49:32.060
Because your real name ain't no good.

49:32.100 --> 49:35.136
All right, it ain't good and….
Follow through.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.500
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?

49:42.200 --> 49:43.900
Then change up the name.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.200
What else?

49:45.300 --> 49:48.864
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?

49:49.100 --> 49:52.202
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.

49:52.800 --> 49:56.560
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?

49:56.600 --> 49:59.160
And then we do, like, some fake competing.

49:59.200 --> 50:03.160
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.160
There's a thinking man, right there.

50:05.200 --> 50:08.500
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?

50:10.400 --> 50:12.200
You and my uncle talk?

50:13.400 --> 50:14.800
How'd it go?

50:15.300 --> 50:16.700
No problem.

50:22.900 --> 50:24.300
Three boxes.

50:24.500 --> 50:28.360
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle…

50:28.400 --> 50:32.100
that it's three times the usual fee for each.

50:36.500 --> 50:39.800
We checked on those chemicals.

50:40.800 --> 50:42.400
We looked into that.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
I was worried, you know?

50:48.200 --> 50:51.632
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.800
A bomb or some shit?

50:55.200 --> 50:57.000
I ain't down for that.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.636
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?

51:02.600 --> 51:03.800
Cocaine.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.960
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.300
No problem.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.400
When?

51:15.200 --> 51:16.700
End of the week.

51:22.400 --> 51:23.600
Maryska.

51:25.300 --> 51:27.300
She's good with English.

51:32.700 --> 51:33.800
They're dead.

51:33.900 --> 51:37.134
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.100
What did she say?

52:07.400 --> 52:11.500
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?

52:43.100 --> 52:47.588
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?

52:53.600 --> 52:54.700
A computer?

52:54.800 --> 52:59.060
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.

52:59.100 --> 53:00.260
You're looking for what?

53:00.300 --> 53:04.360
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.

53:04.400 --> 53:07.460
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway…

53:07.500 --> 53:10.160
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.000
Not to me, it doesn't.

53:12.400 --> 53:13.960
I'm not bringing your open murders…

53:14.000 --> 53:16.560
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.

53:16.600 --> 53:17.600
Lieutenant!

53:17.700 --> 53:21.460
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka…

53:21.500 --> 53:24.860
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.

53:24.900 --> 53:27.160
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement…

53:27.200 --> 53:29.060
and running an investigative unit again.

53:29.100 --> 53:32.260
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.

53:32.300 --> 53:35.864
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.

53:35.900 --> 53:37.800
Rawls, Landsman…

53:38.700 --> 53:42.198
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.

53:42.400 --> 53:45.100
We got enough room for it here, anyway.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.200
You can set up here at the off-site…

53:59.400 --> 54:00.860
and we can share information.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.400
But the murders stay with Homicide.

54:06.300 --> 54:08.900
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.900
Three ROIROs, four containers.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.560
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers…

54:44.600 --> 54:45.960
and we're still short.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
–A good day.
–That it is.

54:51.100 --> 54:55.060
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.

54:55.100 --> 54:56.300
Even you.

55:01.700 --> 55:04.300
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?

55:04.700 --> 55:08.000
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!

55:08.500 --> 55:12.790
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.100
Triple?

55:23.200 --> 55:27.292
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.460
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.

55:30.500 --> 55:33.400
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.

55:34.700 --> 55:37.300
But the writing's on the fucking wall.

55:41.900 --> 55:43.400
Fuck the wall.

55:44.305 --> 55:50.499
