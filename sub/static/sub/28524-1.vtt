00:52.086 --> 00:55.054
      (upbeat pop music)

02:07.528 --> 02:09.360
          (sizzling)

02:09.363 --> 02:11.463
          (laughing)

02:12.766 --> 02:14.533
  - And now, your headliner
  for this evening is

02:14.535 --> 02:16.568
     a local comedy legend.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.537
      How about a nice
      round of applause

02:18.539 --> 02:22.841
  for the Character King of
  Boston comedy, Sweeney?

02:22.843 --> 02:25.344
          (clapping)

02:27.248 --> 02:29.648
    - Thank you, thank you.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.549
             Wow.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.218
             Wow.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.853
     It's great to be here.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.389
 I know what you're thinking.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.893
 If anybody knows anything
 about comedy it's the Chinese.

02:40.895 --> 02:43.662
          (laughing)

02:43.664 --> 02:47.399
 Listen, I'm from Charleston,
 all my friends are dead.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.434
     - You're hilarious.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.337
 I mean, it's so funny I can't
 even remember all the jokes.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.273
        - Thanks, what's
        your name again?

02:54.275 --> 02:55.507
          - Justin.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.176
          - Justin.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.410
You sounded older on the phone.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.412
      - That was my Dad.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.681
 I figured it'd be easier
 if he called instead of me.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.384
     - Oh, what is this,
     school newspaper?

03:05.386 --> 03:06.885
     - No, it's a
     homework assignment.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.420
          - History?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.955
  - No, it's English class.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.424
    I have to write a paper
    about a local celebrity.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.226
  - Local celebrity, I see.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.661
          (laughing)

03:15.663 --> 03:18.297
  Hey, did ya ever see this
  guy sweeping the streets?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.599
          (laughing)

03:22.770 --> 03:24.937
    My name's Jimmy Yannel.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.339
    I'm the shovel man on
    Wednesdays and Sundays.

03:27.341 --> 03:31.877
  I'm the broom man Mondays,
  Tuesdays and Thursdays.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.547
    You need a broom man and
    a shovel man in order

03:35.549 --> 03:36.915
     to sweep the streets.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.584
          (laughing)

03:38.586 --> 03:40.052
         Wait a minute.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.519
      There's a lot of
      local celebrities.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.955
     Why did you pick me?

03:42.957 --> 03:43.855
            Because?

03:45.426 --> 03:46.959
        - Well...
        - You wanna be--

03:46.961 --> 03:48.293
  - Well, I'm thinking about
  doing some standup comedy.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.462
      - Standup comedy.
      - Myself.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.997
            - Right.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.799
 - Wanna read some of my jokes?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.500
         - Oh, yeah.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.469
 I'd love to read your jokes.

03:57.471 --> 04:02.441
 Not now, not while I'm eating,
 but Jesus, that'd be great.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.445
So, I used to live in the
People's Republic of Cambridge.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.513
Neighbors who talked like this.

04:08.515 --> 04:12.451
"You know, okay, so I am
totally against global warming.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.453
"I voted against global warming.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.654
    "Everything is melting.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.491
  "The glaciers are melting,
  the ice caps are melting,

04:19.493 --> 04:23.495
     "the polar bears are
     actually melting.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.329
            "Hello?"

04:24.331 --> 04:25.931
          (laughing)

04:25.933 --> 04:27.799
     - So, how'd you
     start doing comedy?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.601
     - Read that, will ya?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.337
    I don't have my glasses.

04:32.339 --> 04:36.608
 - You can't be what you want
 until you accept who you are.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.343
      - Makes no sense.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.544
             Lin?

04:39.546 --> 04:40.746
     These fortunes,
     they make no sense.

04:40.748 --> 04:41.947
     - It's all bullshit.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.315
         - I love him.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.584
     Lin saw me the first
     time I was on stage.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.819
  - [Lin] It's all bullshit!

04:49.723 --> 04:52.958
  - So, did you get an agent
  when you started comedy?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.526
         - An agent?

04:54.528 --> 04:55.794
             No.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.362
    We didn't get an agent.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.930
 We played places like this.

04:58.932 --> 05:03.302
  Chinese restaurants, bars,
  clubs, funeral parlors.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.472
     Did you ever bomb
     in a funeral parlor?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.474
     That is local comedy.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.776
          (laughing)

05:10.778 --> 05:13.645
My name is Mary Ellen McCarthy.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.516
    I'm a Dorchester mother,
    and I've always said,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.885
 "As long as my kids are happy.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.922
  "Whatever they wanna do,
  as long as they're happy.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.358
    "My daughter's a hooker.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.526
          (laughing)

05:27.528 --> 05:29.795
"God love her, she's got a pimp

05:29.797 --> 05:31.563
      "that dresses her
      very beautifully.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.465
          (laughing)

05:33.467 --> 05:37.102
     "My son, he's in his
     last year at Walpole.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.570
          (laughing)

05:38.572 --> 05:41.840
     "Not the high
     school, the prison."

05:41.842 --> 05:44.609
          (laughing)

05:44.611 --> 05:47.646
 - So, what advice do you have
 for someone starting out?

05:47.648 --> 05:48.814
      - You want advice?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.115
             Okay.

05:50.117 --> 05:53.118
     Do drugs, go to rehab,
     get off the drugs,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.786
     talk about it on TV.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.921
            - Drugs?

05:55.923 --> 05:57.089
            - Drugs.

05:57.091 --> 05:58.590
         It's a joke.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.758
         It's comedy.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.626
 It's like the Joker in Batman.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.627
     You know what I mean?

06:02.629 --> 06:04.129
Wait 'til they get a load of me.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.530
         - Uh, yeah.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.667
    You must really love
    doing comedy, then, huh?

06:08.669 --> 06:09.901
          - Comedy?

06:09.903 --> 06:10.736
          (scoffing)

06:10.738 --> 06:11.870
         It's a curse.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.739
     It's like a love/hate
     relationship.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.140
  - Sounds like my parents.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.441
  They're getting divorced.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.809
             - Oh.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.644
     Well, that's too bad.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.948
    - So, one last question.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.649
         Are you happy?

06:24.651 --> 06:25.817
         - Am I happy?

06:27.621 --> 06:31.156
      What's that got to
      do with anything?

06:31.158 --> 06:34.693
You know every neighborhood
has got one of these guys here.

06:34.695 --> 06:35.727
          (laughing)

06:35.729 --> 06:36.628
             Huh?

06:38.532 --> 06:39.631
     Are you shittin' me?

06:39.633 --> 06:40.732
     Are you shittin' me?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.868
  You gotta be shittin' me.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.036
  You can't shit a shitter.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.775
    So I go to the
    doctor's the other day.

06:49.777 --> 06:53.111
     He told me I gotta
     cut down on the beers

06:53.113 --> 06:55.714
     in the waitin' room.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.849
          (laughing)

06:59.620 --> 07:00.619
             Happy?

07:00.621 --> 07:01.520
             Happy?

07:01.521 --> 07:02.420
      What's that got to
      do with anything?

07:02.423 --> 07:02.888
             Happy?

07:02.890 --> 07:03.822
        Yeah, I'm happy.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.457
      Course I'm happy.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.058
  - Well, wouldn't you
  rather be in L.A. starring

07:07.060 --> 07:08.693
     in your own sitcom or
     maybe your own movie?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.495
          - No, no.

07:10.497 --> 07:14.900
     Look, they told me
     when I started, don't
     do local material.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.468
      You'll get stuck.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.969
  Let me ask you something.

07:17.971 --> 07:22.674
 You tell me, is the stomach
 of success or failure?

07:22.676 --> 07:25.143
     - It's a big stomach.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.513
  - All right, look, I'm
  gonna tell you something.

07:28.515 --> 07:32.617
     I'm gonna have my own
     cable special in L.A.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.652
          - Really?

07:33.654 --> 07:34.886
        That's so cool.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.455
 - Yeah, don't go blabbin' it.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.089
    It's gonna be happenin'.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.524
         Don't blab it.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.826
 - Can I tell my Science Club?
 - No.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.827
            Nobody.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.161
        Don't tell, no.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.533
  - You're the funniest
  fuckin' guy ever, Sweeney.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.601
         - Thank you.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.838
 - Funniest fuckin' guy ever!

07:54.975 --> 07:57.476
     - What a tribute, huh?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.979
        Coming from her?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.481
  Do you know what that
  means to me as an artist?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.490
    - Do you think you could
    come to my classroom

08:11.492 --> 08:12.591
     and talk about comedy?

08:12.593 --> 08:13.492
        It'd be awesome.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.026
    I'd get an A, for sure.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.194
 - There gonna be kids there?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.629
  - Yeah, it's a classroom.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.030
         - No, I can't.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.866
I don't like kids, I hate kids.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.267
        - No, thank you.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.036
 - I can't do it, I hate kids.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.538
 Look, it's nothing personal.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.174
     It's just, I got
     nothing to say to 'em.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.744
  - Did I mention my parents
  are getting divorced?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.111
     - All right, I'll
     come to your class.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.046
          - Really?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.081
 Yeah, I'll come to your class.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.549
     - That's so awesome!

08:37.551 --> 08:38.517
    Thanks so much, Sweeney!
    - Oh yeah, great, great.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.251
        See ya later.
        - That's my dad.

08:39.253 --> 08:40.552
         I gotta go.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.919
      - Okay, yeah, go.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.522
         Go, see ya.
         - Okay, bye.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.623
             - Bye.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.093
      - You're like all
      those other guys.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.096
     Probably got a little
     hussy in your car.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.297
             Yeah.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.200
      (rock bass music)

08:56.003 --> 08:58.904
      (toilet flushing)

09:02.009 --> 09:02.908
             Oh.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.279
             Hey?

09:07.281 --> 09:08.780
      Am I still funny?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.883
          (retching)

09:18.225 --> 09:20.692
 - [Woman] Can I get playback?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.229
  ¶ Cleaning up your
  gutters is what they do ¶

09:24.230 --> 09:25.896
     ¶ The Gutter Guys
     will see it through ¶

09:25.899 --> 09:28.300
     ¶ Not the kinda thing
     that you should do ¶

09:28.302 --> 09:29.868
  ¶ Call those Gutter Guys ¶

09:29.870 --> 09:32.237
      ¶ They'll do do do
      do your gutters ¶

09:32.239 --> 09:34.105
      ¶ They'll clean
      up your gutters ¶

09:34.107 --> 09:35.173
     ¶ Day and night-- ¶
     - Hey, hey!

09:35.175 --> 09:37.576
  No playback, no playback!

09:37.578 --> 09:40.879
     ¶ All day long, they
     love gutters gutters ¶

09:40.881 --> 09:41.913
          - Sweeney?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.181
          - George.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.683
        Where you been?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.284
- Told ya, I had a show a condo.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.020
 - Well, I'm standin' here like
 the freakin' Canadian flag.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.289
 - I have shown this place
 to the same people 12 times.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.792
     I think they're goin'
     for squatter's rights.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.260
 - Have you heard from Gene?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.861
  - Don't worry about Gene.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.363
         He'll call.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.831
 - All right, well you gotta
 get me outta this commercial.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.999
  - Why, what's the problem?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.334
        - It's too high.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.368
     - It's not too high.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.836
        - It's too high!

10:04.838 --> 10:05.303
      What do you mean,
      it's not too high?

10:05.305 --> 10:06.605
         It's too high.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.372
     - It's not too high.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.273
    - Well, then you do it.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.274
     - They don't want me.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.609
 They want the Character King.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.344
     Plus, it's too high.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.012
      - [Woman] Action!

10:14.915 --> 10:17.248
     - Hello, I'm a leaf.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.184
     We love the fall
     because then we turn

10:19.186 --> 10:21.353
into all these beautiful colors.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.922
    But leaves never leave.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.826
 They go into your gutter,
 then they clog your gutter.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.394
     That's when you need
     The Gutter Guys.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.096
         That's when...

10:31.098 --> 10:32.831
    Hey, could someone hold
    this goddamn ladder?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.733
    - Sweeney, Gene called.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.703
            - What?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.071
     - [Woman] For crying
     out loud, cut!

10:40.073 --> 10:43.041
     ¶ Gutters, gutters,
     gutters, gutters ¶

10:43.043 --> 10:43.875
     ¶ Gutter Guys get-- ¶

10:43.877 --> 10:45.043
            - Jesus.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.178
  Another fucking audition?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.882
- Gene loves you, you know that.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.417
 You know how these things go.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.285
         - When is it?

10:54.287 --> 10:55.654
        - Next Saturday.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.657
    Give you plenty of time
    to work on your set.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.158
        - Work on a set?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.092
         I have a set.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.293
 I don't need to work on a set.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.329
     - Yeah, 'bout that.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.332
  Gene doesn't really want
  you doin' the characters.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.034
            - What?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.969
 - He thinks they're too local.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.271
 You know this is a national
 spot, you gotta do jokes

11:13.273 --> 11:14.939
     that go over in Idaho.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.408
            - Idaho?

11:16.410 --> 11:18.677
     What am I gonna do?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.045
  An impression of a potato?

11:20.047 --> 11:20.945
             - Ah.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.419
      It's between you
      and Heather Chase.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.887
            - What?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.689
 Are you fucking shitting me?

11:30.691 --> 11:31.807
            Heather?

11:31.808 --> 11:32.924
  She's only been doing it
  six months and she sucks.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.126
 - Yeah, that doesn't matter.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.728
     She's got the look
     and everybody loves--

11:36.730 --> 11:37.996
  - Well, it matters to me.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.264
        I got integrity.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.832
      Remember when we
      saw Richard Pryor?

11:40.834 --> 11:41.933
     He set the bar high.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.802
 We were going for somethin'.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.805
      - Said the man in
      the leaf costume.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.106
          (sighing)

11:49.810 --> 11:50.792
          - Fuck it.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.775
 Fuck Gene, fuck the audition.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.311
      I'm not doin' it.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.246
  - All right, Sweeney,
  Sweeney, Sweeney, hold on.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.115
Let's be honest with each other.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.751
  You're not gonna get many
  more chances like this.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.820
 I know it sucks, I really do.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.088
          You know.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.157
     But even if you don't
     get the cable special,

12:06.159 --> 12:09.360
     you'll always be
     the Character King.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.162
      No one can take
      that away from ya.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.399
     - Yeah, Character King
     with no characters.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.735
All right, I'll think about it.

12:16.737 --> 12:21.439
But you have gotta get me outta
this before I kill myself.

12:24.845 --> 12:29.047
     First time I had sex,
     it was in the backseat

12:29.049 --> 12:31.483
of my boyfriend's father's car.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.186
     With my boyfriend's
     father, yeah.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.088
     Sex, do not enjoy sex.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.993
 It is for procreation only.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.294
        Read the label.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.465
     If you don't look at
     it as procreation,

12:47.467 --> 12:51.936
 if you look at it as
 pleasure, you will go to hell.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.439
             Yeah.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.475
          (laughing)

12:57.477 --> 12:58.977
    - You were really funny.
    (lounge music)

12:58.979 --> 13:00.512
 - Thank you, thank you,
 thank you, thank thank you.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.981
     Support local comedy.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.382
 Otherwise, I have to mug ya.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.817
        Hey, goodnight.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.985
     Thank you very much.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.521
        (intense music)

13:11.291 --> 13:13.825
          (sweeping)

13:16.463 --> 13:17.529
         Who's there?

13:20.901 --> 13:25.970
     ¶ Well, if only they
     had checked to see ¶

13:27.174 --> 13:28.573
      ¶ He mighta opened
      up his heart ¶

13:28.575 --> 13:31.309
        (intense music)

13:56.036 --> 13:57.535
      - [Sweeney] Hey,
      what should I do?

13:57.537 --> 14:00.505
     - You know the shit
     I've been through.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.274
     They didn't even want
     me auditionin' for TV.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.476
     One fuckin' swear
     and it was all over.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.313
 Thank fuckin' god for cable!

14:08.315 --> 14:10.215
      But you know what?

14:10.217 --> 14:11.516
  You can't let it worry ya.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.118
 Come on, we're almost there.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.222
            Keep up.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.425
  - [Sweeney] Jesus Christ,
  was that eight flights?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.978
 - Yep, come on, almost done.
 - I know.

14:22.979 --> 14:25.530
 Are we doin' flight for one
 of these charity's things?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.899
 We're climbin' for restless
 legs or we're climbin'

14:27.901 --> 14:30.602
    for irritable bowels or
    erectile disfunction?

14:30.604 --> 14:32.871
        - Okay, Sweeney.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.139
     This is gonna make the
     hike all worthwhile.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.374
         Yes, indeed.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.575
     - Wow, I was wondering
     what we were doin'.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.910
     - Come on over here
     and help me out.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.228
     Make yourself useful.

14:40.229 --> 14:41.545
 Pull up that shade, but
 don't pull it all the way up.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.481
      - Not all the way.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.315
            - Nope.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.250
     Ah, a little bit more.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.284
 That's perfect right there.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.185
          Atta boy.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.490
 Listen, if there's one thing
 I learned in this business,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.659
      you gotta do what
      makes you happy.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.096
    Sure, I had the broads,
    the booze, the drugs,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.331
      the movies, the TV
      show, but you know

15:00.333 --> 15:01.366
  what really made me happy?

15:01.368 --> 15:03.101
         - All of it.
         - Absolutely.

15:03.103 --> 15:03.935
      - [Sweeney] You
      better believe it.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.470
          (laughing)

15:05.472 --> 15:07.605
 - But at the end of the day, I
 was doin' what I wanted to do

15:07.607 --> 15:09.941
     and that's the key.

15:09.943 --> 15:13.177
     See, Sweeney, comedy
     is introspection.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.646
     Everybody knows that.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.482
  Whether you're lookin'
  for the perfect punchline

15:17.484 --> 15:19.217
    or the perfect comeback,

15:19.219 --> 15:22.587
  what we all basically are
  lookin' for is approval.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.956
  Comedy comes from within.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.493
    If it doesn't manage to
    finish on the outside,

15:28.495 --> 15:30.528
      nobody's laughin'.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.231
  You wanna know what to do?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.166
         Look in there.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.235
    And let me look in here.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.204
        Oh, you're new.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.105
            Oh, oh.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.977
     Oh, Gladys is back.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.313
          (laughing)

15:49.115 --> 15:51.115
 You musta got your hip fixed.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.184
        Oh, look at you.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.253
    That's my little bundle.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.457
 Don't you judge me, Sweeney.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.259
Don't you fuckin' dare judge me!

16:01.261 --> 16:02.694
- [Sweeney] I'm not judgin' ya.

16:02.696 --> 16:05.330
 I just don't feel comfortable
 while you're doin' this.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.698
         - Oh, get out.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.598
            Get out!

16:12.439 --> 16:13.588
         Oh, oh, oh.

16:13.589 --> 16:14.738
      Is that a downward
      dog for daddy?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.207
             Yeah.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.275
             Oh!

16:17.277 --> 16:18.209
        (ukulele music)

16:18.211 --> 16:19.377
  Stretch up, reach the sun.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.713
 Reach for the, oh yes, yes!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.316
      That's my Gladys.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.551
             Oh.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.452
             Yeah.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.991
 - Grateful Dead's one of the
 greatest bands of all time,

16:32.993 --> 16:34.993
 never had a number one hit.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.995
     "Friend of the Devil,"
     it's a great song,

16:36.997 --> 16:38.496
     but is it better
     than "Shake It Off?"

16:38.498 --> 16:40.264
      Yeah, I think so.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.467
  But just because it didn't
  make it to number one,

16:42.469 --> 16:44.002
     that shouldn't matter.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.404
        - I'm not sure I
        can follow this.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.273
    - Being true to yourself
    is what matters,

16:49.275 --> 16:52.577
     unless what you seek
     changes the truth.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.181
    Then maybe it's the real
    truth that you seek.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.517
    - Yeah, I can see that.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.119
            Sort of.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.020
         - 'Scuse me?

17:02.022 --> 17:02.754
            - What?

17:02.756 --> 17:04.055
- Can I get my sausage already?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.356
     - "Get my sausage?"

17:05.358 --> 17:06.758
     Can you hold on
     one second, please?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.792
     My friend needs some
     advice over here.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.029
      Let me talk to him
      for one second.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.597
      Why don't you take
      out your phone,

17:12.598 --> 17:15.500
check your fuckin' Instant Dick
account there, Leather Lips?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.335
     - All right, Nick, I
     can come back later.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.169
          - No, no!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.103
    Sweeney, it's all right!

17:19.105 --> 17:20.805
  Some people are just rude!

17:20.807 --> 17:21.806
 That'll be four bucks, sir.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.307
 - [Kid] I already paid for it.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.709
     - Okay, here you go.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.243
     Uncircumcised, just
     the way you like 'em.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.712
    - I agree with you
    about the Dead, though.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.580
     - Oh, thank Christ,
     I can sleep tonight.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.782
         Don't pander.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.183
  It's not becoming on you.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.084
             Next!

17:35.188 --> 17:37.422
          (sighing)

17:38.558 --> 17:40.825
 - I sucked in Little League.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.828
     My teammates used to
     shout, "No batter,

17:43.830 --> 17:47.732
     "no batter, no batter"
     when I was at bat.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.768
      (throat clearing)

17:50.770 --> 17:53.304
    My girlfriend dumped me.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.441
 Yeah, she threw all my
 stuff out onto the sidewalk

17:56.443 --> 17:58.076
     and I live at home.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.446
      (throat clearing)

18:01.448 --> 18:03.081
     My cat sheds tears.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.286
      (throat clearing)

18:08.288 --> 18:10.188
     Thank you, good night.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.197
          (sighing)

18:21.234 --> 18:23.601
          (sighing)

18:23.603 --> 18:25.303
      - Tough set, huh?

18:25.305 --> 18:26.637
            - Yeah.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.172
         - You okay?

18:28.174 --> 18:30.374
     - I don't know, man.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.476
         That sucked.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.477
          (scoffing)

18:32.479 --> 18:33.544
        - It really did.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.813
 Jesus, wow, they hated you.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.582
     And I can't blame 'em.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.118
 You know the guy in the back
 who yelled out, "You suck?"

18:40.120 --> 18:41.419
        - Yeah, I think.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.820
     - Yeah, that was me.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.888
          (laughing)

18:43.890 --> 18:45.790
         I'm kidding.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.791
        These are jokes!

18:46.793 --> 18:47.825
            Come on!

18:47.827 --> 18:49.427
     You got good stuff.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.328
     You'll be all right.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.762
     Just stick with it.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.298
 If you stick with it,
 you'll be miserable like me.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.701
 But you gotta stick with it.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.337
 - All right, come on, Sweeney.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.138
     We're waitin' for ya.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.439
         Let's go eat.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.773
         - That's Lily.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.143
  She's a human dark cloud.
  - Oh, come on.

19:05.145 --> 19:05.776
  - [Sweeney] You all right?

19:05.778 --> 19:06.911
    - Yeah, thanks Sweeney.

19:06.913 --> 19:10.248
     (upbeat flute music)

19:11.751 --> 19:13.351
- So, it's an all-girls college.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.919
     200 girls sittin'
     there lookin' at me.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.321
      You know what my
      openin' line was?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.823
    I don't think I
    brought enough condoms.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.191
          (laughing)

19:20.193 --> 19:21.325
            Killed.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.894
          (laughing)

19:22.896 --> 19:24.896
- Anyway, what were you saying?

19:24.898 --> 19:26.931
  - If I do the characters,
  Gene's gonna give

19:26.933 --> 19:29.551
     the show to Heather.

19:29.552 --> 19:32.170
- I think you owe it to
yourself to drop the characters.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.204
  You don't need to do them.

19:33.206 --> 19:33.938
          - Really?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.274
- I did a benefit for a church.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.808
 There were nuns in the crowd.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.279
 Priest comes up to me
 before the show, blesses me,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.947
 then tells me no bad language.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.448
      You know what my
      opening line was?

19:44.450 --> 19:45.950
  How the fuck is everybody?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.351
            Killed.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.853
    Then I did the joke
    about how my penis looks

19:48.855 --> 19:50.288
     like my grandmother.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.455
      You know that bit.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.690
            Killed.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.759
     I got nuns doubled
     over with laughter.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.460
     They don't even know
     what a penis is.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.462
     I didn't compromise.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.299
- It's not compromising, Frank.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.967
     It's an adjustment.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.902
     It's okay to adjust.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.438
    - Let me remind you,
    when I first moved here,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.640
    all I heard was Sweeney,
    Sweeney, Sweeney,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.876
     like you were the only
     comic that mattered.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.379
  Now, the guys you started
  with, they moved on.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.548
 Sitcoms, movies, talk shows.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.284
     But you're still here,
     you're still doin' it.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.519
         You know why?

20:21.521 --> 20:22.954
      'Cause you're the
      Character King.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.455
 Why would you fuck with that?

20:24.457 --> 20:28.426
    - Okay, so what do you
    think I should do, Lily?

20:29.696 --> 20:31.696
 - By the way, I saw Heather
 totally fuckin' kill

20:31.698 --> 20:33.231
        the other night.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.699
     Now, she's got two
     things goin' for her.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.901
  Every woman in the
  audience wants to be her,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.970
and every guy wants to fuck her.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.338
        And she's funny.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.540
 I heard she's movin' to L.A.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.276
 I think she's gonna be famous.

20:46.246 --> 20:46.911
             What?

20:48.014 --> 20:50.014
          (sighing)

20:51.517 --> 20:53.284
  - I don't know, Jonathan.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.752
     I'm at a crossroads.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.822
  I feel like my whole life
  hangs in the balance.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.925
- You do understand Sweeney
that I'm not really a therapist?

21:00.927 --> 21:02.994
     I'm still gonna
     have to charge you.

21:02.996 --> 21:08.266
 - This could be my last chance
 to do something really big.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.270
  - See, I think you have to
  remember that life is not

21:12.272 --> 21:13.704
     about last chances.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.275
     But having said that,
     I see what you mean.

21:17.277 --> 21:21.312
     Sometimes in our work,
     as in life, the lines

21:21.314 --> 21:23.314
     between comfort and
     love are blurred.

21:23.316 --> 21:26.284
     And sometimes, we need
     a challenge in order

21:26.286 --> 21:28.019
     to grow as a person.

21:28.021 --> 21:31.656
    It might be painful, but
    change is what you need.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.291
             - Huh.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.992
      That makes sense.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.061
 - I'm so glad it makes sense
 to you because I don't have

21:37.063 --> 21:38.796
        a fuckin' clue.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.697
             - Oh.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.333
         You know what?

21:42.335 --> 21:44.001
     That's what I need.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.570
     I need a challenge.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.539
  I need to shake things up.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.940
             Yeah.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.042
     Thank you, Jonathan.

21:51.044 --> 21:51.909
            - Sure.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.681
 Oh, hey Nicole, did I ever
 tell you that my uncle used

21:56.683 --> 22:00.518
    to be a prominent
    judge in New York City?

22:00.520 --> 22:03.587
    And now, he's a wino
    living in Central Park,

22:03.589 --> 22:06.057
     but out of respect,
     people still say,

22:06.059 --> 22:08.092
 "May I approach the bench?"

22:08.094 --> 22:10.328
     I think that's sweet.

22:11.497 --> 22:15.733
  - Hey, not for nothin',
  how come we're doin' this

22:15.735 --> 22:17.401
 when you're right over there?

22:17.403 --> 22:20.838
     - For me, it's
     technology, I love it.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.809
    And it seems like it's
    more sanitary this way.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.645
        (birds chirping)

22:28.715 --> 22:30.381
     - Okay, they just
     wanna reshoot the end

22:30.383 --> 22:32.383
     where you almost
     fell off the ladder.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.884
 - George, I made up my mind.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.086
        - That's great.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.620
  Go change behind the tree.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.422
 - I'm gonna do the audition.

22:38.424 --> 22:39.990
 I'm gonna drop the characters
 and then do the audition.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.125
    - Ah, that's just great.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.610
    It's fantastic.
    - I feel good about it.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.094
     - I got a really good
     feelin' about this.

22:44.097 --> 22:44.929
     - Me too, me too.
     - Now, would you go

22:44.931 --> 22:46.397
        behind the tree?

22:46.399 --> 22:47.698
         - Hey Sweeney!
         - Yeah.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.998
  - I just wanted to say we
  really love your stuff.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.185
            - Great.

22:51.186 --> 22:53.370
     - I have a Gutter
     Guys hat just for you.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.539
         - Thank you.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.707
    I'm good, but thank you.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.942
          - Sweeney?

22:57.944 --> 23:00.611
  Oh, don't worry about him.

23:00.613 --> 23:01.946
         He'll be fine.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.581
     He's just got a lot on
     his mind, that's all.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.649
     It's gonna be great.

23:05.651 --> 23:06.951
     Let me just say that.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.152
      He loves gutters.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.421
He talks about gutters all day.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.957
     Just gutters, gutters,
     gutters, all day long.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.976
      Can't get enough.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.994
 Sometimes I will go home, I'll
 be tryin' to get some rest,

23:16.996 --> 23:18.963
 he'll call me up, "Could we
 talk more about gutters?"

23:18.965 --> 23:20.898
 And I go, "Come on, enough
 with the gutters for today."

23:20.900 --> 23:23.167
     He was in a band
     called the Downspouts.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.568
     Can you believe that?

23:24.570 --> 23:25.770
     It's gonna be great.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.438
    I'll go get him and
    we'll take care of this.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.408
    You guys just stay
    there and keep doin'...

23:30.410 --> 23:32.009
     Huge fan of gutters.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.411
             Huge.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.614
    (acoustic guitar music)

23:38.518 --> 23:39.717
         - So I travel.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.486
Went to San Francisco recently.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.854
    Got my nipples pierced.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.923
          (laughing)

23:45.925 --> 23:47.458
      Don't worry, they
      caught the guy.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.926
          (laughing)

23:48.928 --> 23:51.462
          (clapping)

23:51.464 --> 23:52.496
        That's my time.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.564
     Thank you, good night.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.699
          (cheering)

23:55.701 --> 23:57.868
 - Oh, Heather Chase, folks.

23:57.870 --> 23:58.969
         Let her know.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.905
             Wow!

24:00.906 --> 24:02.840
 Heather's gonna be auditionin'
 for her own comedy special,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.208
      so she'll be back.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.943
     Let's wish her luck.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.450
          (sighing)

24:14.987 --> 24:15.986
     - Nice set, Heather.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.521
          - Thanks.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.790
     Oh, you mean the show.

24:19.792 --> 24:23.194
 - I guess it's down to me and
 you for this cable special.

24:23.196 --> 24:25.196
     You must be nervous?

24:25.198 --> 24:26.864
- I don't get nervous, Sweeney.

24:26.866 --> 24:27.932
         I get ready.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.970
 And I am gonna nail that
 audition and get the special.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.206
- Huh, pretty sure of yourself.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.907
         Why's that?

24:36.909 --> 24:38.142
    - Well, I have something
    that you don't have.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.078
  - Something I don't have?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.079
          (snapping)

24:42.081 --> 24:43.180
             Tits.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.181
          (laughing)

24:44.183 --> 24:45.082
             - No.

24:46.085 --> 24:46.984
             Balls.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.532
    - So, I'm outta practice
    pickin' up women.

25:01.534 --> 25:05.202
     My line used to be,
     I'd say to a woman,

25:05.204 --> 25:08.973
     "Listen, when you're
     done vomiting, can
     I get your number?"

25:08.975 --> 25:10.508
          (laughing)

25:10.510 --> 25:12.076
      I went to the bar.

25:13.246 --> 25:16.180
  These two women, they'll
  talkin' about a three way.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.549
 I'm thinkin', "Jesus, I
 can't even get into a rotary.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.917
      "How do you merge?

25:20.920 --> 25:23.153
  "Which car goes in first?"

25:24.524 --> 25:26.690
          (laughing)

25:26.692 --> 25:27.825
      You guys have been
      a great crowd.

25:27.827 --> 25:28.792
          Thank you.

25:28.794 --> 25:33.597
         (cheering)
         (rock music)

25:45.745 --> 25:48.279
        (intense music)

25:49.916 --> 25:52.216
          (sweeping)

26:04.297 --> 26:07.097
          (sweeping)

26:07.099 --> 26:09.633
          (stomping)

26:15.708 --> 26:18.042
          (sweeping)

26:23.349 --> 26:25.649
          (sweeping)

26:33.626 --> 26:38.062
          (thumping)
          (groaning)

26:40.066 --> 26:43.067
      (odd string music)

26:47.273 --> 26:48.372
             Jimmy?

26:49.809 --> 26:52.142
          (groaning)

26:58.150 --> 26:59.350
    - You've gotta call the
    police, get these punks

26:59.352 --> 27:01.352
        off the street.

27:01.354 --> 27:02.987
     - I saw who did it.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.822
 - Then you should
 definitely call the police.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.625
        - It was Jimmy.
        - Who's Jimmy?

27:07.627 --> 27:09.627
      - Jimmy, you know.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.361
    - Who the hell is that?

27:10.363 --> 27:11.395
     - Jimmy, from my act.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.663
             Jimmy.

27:12.665 --> 27:13.897
 - You're Jimmy from your act.

27:13.899 --> 27:15.799
     - No, it was Jimmy.
     - Right.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.301
      And you're Jimmy.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.669
So you mean he looked like you?

27:18.671 --> 27:19.370
      - No, no, no, no.

27:19.372 --> 27:20.771
         It was Jimmy.

27:20.773 --> 27:21.805
         It was Jimmy.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.140
     He had a broomstick.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.675
    - Why are we whispering?

27:24.677 --> 27:25.909
        - It was Jimmy.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.077
     - What the hell are
     we talkin' about?

27:27.079 --> 27:27.978
            - Jimmy!

27:37.723 --> 27:41.091
        (chair scraping)

27:41.093 --> 27:42.292
 - What happened to your head?

27:42.294 --> 27:43.994
     - I cut it shavin'.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.229
             - Oh.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.730
         That sucks.
         - Yeah.

27:46.732 --> 27:47.898
    - I can't wait to shave.

27:47.900 --> 27:48.799
             - Mm.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.403
  - So, you're still comin'
  to my class, right?

27:52.405 --> 27:54.071
  - Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

27:54.073 --> 27:54.938
  I'm comin' to your class.
  - Hey.

27:57.176 --> 27:57.792
             - Hi.
             - Hi.

27:57.793 --> 27:58.409
- Sweeney, this is Carla Fisher.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.943
          - Ah, wow.
          - Hi.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.446
    - This your girlfriend?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.782
     I underestimated you.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.283
        - Uh, my mother.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.419
      - Oh, your mother.

28:08.421 --> 28:09.687
      Nice to meet you.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.421
         - Thank you.

28:10.423 --> 28:11.689
 I've heard a lot about you.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.790
    - My mom's a
    documentary film maker.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.158
            - Okay.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.392
         The Happy Guy.

28:16.762 --> 28:19.329
     - I would love it if
     you could watch it.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.432
 - It won first place at the
 North Dakota Film Festival.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.435
  - And I sent it to
  Sundance, fingers crossed.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.736
             - Yes!

28:25.737 --> 28:27.036
     It's about a guy who
     lives under a bridge

28:27.039 --> 28:28.405
     with a lot of pigeons.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.374
     - Ah, nature movie.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.342
  - Well, also they actually
  poop on him so much,

28:32.344 --> 28:33.777
  he dies from poop poison.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.312
    - You can die from that?

28:35.314 --> 28:38.849
     - Well, he had
     other health issues.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.784
      But listen, let me
      get to the point.

28:40.786 --> 28:44.021
     I think you would make
     an amazing subject

28:44.023 --> 28:45.389
      for a documentary.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.457
          - Really?

28:46.459 --> 28:47.858
         - Yeah, yeah.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.027
    I like stories about
    people that have fallen

28:50.029 --> 28:51.729
     between the cracks.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.997
 They're lost in No Man's Land.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.099
          They get--

28:55.101 --> 28:56.734
     - Pooped on.
     - Pooped on sometimes.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.769
 Not pooped on, but overlooked.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.804
  - Wait, wait, wait, wait!

29:00.806 --> 29:02.906
  Justin, I appreciate
  what you're tryin' to do,

29:02.908 --> 29:05.042
     but I didn't fall
     through any cracks.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.244
 I don't live under a bridge.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.246
     What am I, some
     kind of freak show?

29:09.248 --> 29:10.481
 - [Carla] No, of course not.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.383
 - What am I, the Elephant Man?
 - Who?

29:13.385 --> 29:14.418
      - Listen, listen.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.120
    I'm trying to help you.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.354
             - How?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.757
     By makin' me into
     some kind of loser?

29:19.759 --> 29:22.359
  - How about a documentary
  about your life

29:22.361 --> 29:24.461
     up on the big screen?

29:24.463 --> 29:25.996
        - I don't know.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.098
             No.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.000
     - Come on, you have
     the story Sweeney

29:30.002 --> 29:32.035
  that film festivals love.

29:32.037 --> 29:35.105
    This could open all
    kinds of doors for you.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.074
     Movies and television.

29:37.076 --> 29:42.146
 Local comedy legend finally
 gets his shot at the big time.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.449
  Is he gonna get the comedy
  special that propels him

29:45.451 --> 29:48.886
     to Hollywood, or is
     he gonna, will he...

29:48.888 --> 29:50.854
 - Is he gonna, will he what?

29:50.856 --> 29:52.556
     - [Carla] You tell me.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.459
  - Who's the Elephant Man?

29:55.461 --> 29:59.496
    - [Sweeney] You don't
    have to raise your hand.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.332
        - Oh hey, did ya
        enjoy your time?

30:02.334 --> 30:03.901
  Make sure you take a card.

30:03.903 --> 30:04.802
          Or a pen.

30:05.838 --> 30:06.937
 So I've got my number on it.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.172
         Take a mint.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.008
 No, believe me, take a mint.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.477
 - [Sweeney] George, George?

30:13.479 --> 30:14.945
        Where'd you go?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.513
  - Oh, yeah, a documentary.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.581
            No, no.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.383
 Sweeney, couldn't be happier.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.384
         That's great.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.518
         No, terrific.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.020
 - Oh yeah, that's what I said.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.121
     I jumped all over it.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.355
         No brainer.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.290
      - All right, all
      right, I gotta go.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.124
      All right, thanks.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.358
        All right, bye.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.562
    (acoustic guitar music)

30:40.506 --> 30:41.905
     - So, I thought the
     show went pretty well.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.106
     - [Man] You did great.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.842
     - Thank you, you too.
     - I thought that

30:44.844 --> 30:45.342
  your new stuff was great.
  - Oh, I appreciate that.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.577
          (mumbling)

30:46.579 --> 30:48.579
     - I thought it did.

30:48.581 --> 30:49.513
            - Yeah.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.399
          (groaning)

30:52.400 --> 30:55.284
 - Oh, anyway, so this woman
 comes up to me after my set,

30:55.287 --> 30:59.890
 and she goes, "Why do you talk
 about your vagina so much?"

30:59.892 --> 31:03.126
     I'm like, "Because I
     don't have a dick."

31:03.128 --> 31:04.027
             Right?

31:06.632 --> 31:08.498
     - [Carla] So, what do
     you think of Sweeney?

31:08.500 --> 31:09.900
     - Oh, Sweeney's great.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.935
     I've only been doin'
     comedy a few years,

31:11.937 --> 31:13.937
     but he's got me gigs.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.642
I've opened for him a few times.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.410
      He's very helpful.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.479
      - [Justin] Are
      you wearing a bra?

31:22.481 --> 31:23.447
      - [Carla] Justin!

31:23.449 --> 31:26.016
         (banjo music)

31:31.657 --> 31:33.323
        - Hey, Sweeney.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.458
         How ya doin'?

31:39.331 --> 31:42.399
 So, last year, Sweeney and I
 did an overnight corporate gig

31:42.401 --> 31:44.001
     up in northern Minn.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.502
      You know, where
      everyone's related

31:45.504 --> 31:46.904
 and share each other's teeth.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.672
    We drove down together.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.641
 Long drive, but we had fun.

31:50.643 --> 31:52.175
        Show went great.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.112
          I opened.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.613
        Sweeney closed.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.615
 Then we went back to the motel

31:58.617 --> 32:01.318
      and that's when
      things got weird.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.588
So, we were sitting on the bed.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.257
 One thing leads to another.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.594
 And the next thing you know,
 we're talking about how much

32:10.596 --> 32:12.696
    we got paid for the gig.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.032
 That was a mistake, I know.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.266
          (laughing)

32:16.268 --> 32:19.236
     Turns out we were
     getting paid the same.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.004
     Sweeney was pissed.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.975
     He thought he should
     be getting paid more.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.210
  But I'm a good comic, too.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.249
          (sipping)

32:32.251 --> 32:34.084
     I think he's jealous.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.687
     In fact, I know he is.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.057
         He should be.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.359
 - So, did you and Sweeney...

32:44.663 --> 32:46.163
      Were you a couple?

32:46.165 --> 32:47.364
          (scoffing)

32:47.366 --> 32:48.598
      - Me and Sweeney?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.733
             Sex?

32:49.735 --> 32:50.968
             No.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.636
             No.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.104
      - [Justin] Are
      you wearing a bra?

32:54.106 --> 32:55.272
      - [Carla] Justin.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.574
  - Are you wearing a brain?

32:57.576 --> 33:00.110
         - Wait, wait.

33:00.111 --> 33:02.645
    You gave Heather the
    Gutter Guys commercial?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.748
  Are you managing her now?

33:04.750 --> 33:06.683
     - [George] No, I'm
     not managing her now.

33:06.685 --> 33:07.751
         Technically.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.221
     They needed somebody,
     she's hot right now.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.389
    You didn't wanna do it.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.690
     Remember that part.

33:13.692 --> 33:14.658
          Yeah, I...

33:14.660 --> 33:15.726
          Yeah, no.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.227
      Hang on a second.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.628
    I'm dealing with people
    that just stepped out

33:18.630 --> 33:20.197
     of an IKEA catalog.

33:20.199 --> 33:23.166
     Yeah, hasn't changed
     in nine hours.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.336
     It's still oil heat.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.673
 They were experimenting
 with the fire from a dragon.

33:29.675 --> 33:33.110
     But the food costs
     were just too high.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.651
- Are you gonna film everything?

33:41.653 --> 33:43.186
 - [Carla] It's a documentary.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.755
        I'm documenting.

33:44.757 --> 33:46.723
 - Look, I'm done with this.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.592
     It's just business.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.394
     You gotta understand.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.298
 (slow electric guitar music)

33:59.638 --> 34:01.104
  - [Sweeney] Good morning.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.205
- Yeah, what can I get for you?

34:02.207 --> 34:03.573
 - I want a breakfast sandwich.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.075
I don't want it on a croissant.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.043
    I want it on an English
    muffin, no cheese.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.144
        (intense music)

34:07.146 --> 34:08.178
     - [Server] No cheese?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.246
         - No cheese.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.380
 - [Server] How about American?

34:11.382 --> 34:13.116
         - No cheese.

34:13.118 --> 34:14.184
    Are you gonna get this?

34:14.186 --> 34:15.318
        You're texting.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.620
- I'm not texting, I'm Tweeting.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.054
      You want cheddar?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.790
    - I do not want cheese.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.824
    Are you still Tweeting?

34:21.827 --> 34:24.061
- No, now I'm actually texting.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.762
  But I have a good memory.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.431
     I'll be right back.

34:28.534 --> 34:29.833
          (exhaling)

34:29.835 --> 34:31.400
        - Hey, Sweeney.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.235
        (intense music)

34:33.237 --> 34:35.739
  Wake up and smell the
  powder, you back-stabbin'

34:35.741 --> 34:40.177
      son of a bitch.
      (firearm shooting)

34:42.181 --> 34:45.148
      (firearm shooting)

34:55.159 --> 34:56.426
 - Here's your sprinkle donut.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.495
    No cheese, just cheddar.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.632
 - Are you fucking shitting me?

35:04.736 --> 35:06.870
  - It's not a bullet wound.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.105
      This is a scratch.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.106
 They're completely different.

35:09.108 --> 35:09.773
     Bullets leave holes.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.575
        - It was Fitzy.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.809
         It was Fitzy.
         - Oh, no!

35:12.811 --> 35:14.144
            No, no.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.145
 We're not doin' this again.

35:15.147 --> 35:15.846
      - That was Fitzy.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.280
     He tried to kill me.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.882
    - Come on, first it was
    Jimmy, now it's Fitzy.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.884
What are you trying to tell me?

35:20.886 --> 35:23.687
    That somehow, through
    some kinda magical spell

35:23.689 --> 35:27.691
 or an alternative universe,
 the fictitious characters

35:27.693 --> 35:30.527
 you've created for your own
 act, they've somehow come

35:30.529 --> 35:32.429
     to life and they're
     trying to kill you?

35:32.431 --> 35:33.797
             - Yes.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.132
- No, no, you're not doin' this.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.466
     You're tryin' to
     sabotage the audition

35:36.468 --> 35:37.734
     because you're afraid.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.369
     - Look, I'm not
     afraid of an audition.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.138
- Yeah, maybe not the audition.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.507
    But you're afraid of
    what you might find out,

35:43.509 --> 35:48.578
 which is being Character
 King doesn't mean that much.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.514
     That came out wrong.

35:50.516 --> 35:51.715
     I'm sorry, I didn't
     mean that, Sweeney.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.649
          I didn't.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.750
    - It's okay, it's okay.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.651
          That's it.

35:54.653 --> 36:00.190
 I throw them out of my act,
 then they try to kill me.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.760
 - You ever stop to think,
 Sweeney, that maybe there's

36:03.762 --> 36:08.265
 a bookie or a jealous husband,
 maybe an ex-girlfriend,

36:08.267 --> 36:11.568
     somebody real, might
     wanna see ya dead?

36:12.938 --> 36:14.571
 - They all wanna see me dead.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.173
      That's not what
      I'm talkin' about.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.941
    The fictitious ones are
    the ones who are tryin'

36:17.943 --> 36:19.910
      to actually do it!

36:19.912 --> 36:21.945
     - [George] Okay, you
     know what you need?

36:21.947 --> 36:23.680
            - What?

36:23.682 --> 36:27.717
 - You need a real shower, and
 I need to get us some coffee.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.686
    Stop playin' with that.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.591
 - [Justin] Sweeney, my man!

36:34.593 --> 36:35.759
         It's Justin.

36:35.761 --> 36:36.660
          Just toon.

36:36.662 --> 36:39.696
    Thinking about using
    that for my stage name.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.299
    Uh, you're still comin'
    to my class, right bro?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.868
     I'm almost done
     with my assignment.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.670
    My dad's gonna proof
    it, make a few changes.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.938
    I think you'll like it.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.306
        I'm at my mom's.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.774
         Call me back.

36:50.776 --> 36:51.675
          Okay, bro.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.543
            Brosky.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.445
          Later on.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.379
          (laughing)

36:56.381 --> 36:58.215
     - Ah, that's funny.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.351
      (water trickling)

37:01.353 --> 37:04.287
        (intense music)

37:06.258 --> 37:07.657
            George?

37:07.659 --> 37:08.558
          You back?

37:15.934 --> 37:17.434
        Mother fuckin'!

37:19.938 --> 37:22.339
 Fuckin' Jesus, mother fuckin'!

37:22.341 --> 37:25.575
     What the fuck is
     goin' on around here?

37:28.447 --> 37:31.448
Stay away from me, you old hag!

37:31.450 --> 37:32.716
      Oh, not you, June.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.719
     It's just someone's
     tryin' to kill me.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.387
     Hey, say hi to Sal.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.559
  - [George] Was that Mary
  Ellen that just ran past?

37:42.561 --> 37:43.460
            - Yeah.

37:44.563 --> 37:47.530
     - She's even uglier
     as a real person.

37:49.301 --> 37:50.700
        - I heard that.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.770
     You're no box a
     chocolates yourself!

37:57.009 --> 38:01.278
  - Now I'm takin' shit from
  a fictional character?

38:04.016 --> 38:05.649
 Yeah nah, it's nothing big.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.450
  You were lucky this time.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.420
 - Maybe I should kill them.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.822
        - Look, don't do
        anything stupid.

38:12.824 --> 38:17.661
 If somethin' happens to them,
 doesn't summin' happen to you?

38:17.663 --> 38:18.828
        - I don't know.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.664
 I don't know how this works.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.900
 - Okay, first thing we gotta
 do is cancel that audition.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.001
          - Oh, no.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.069
          (laughing)

38:26.071 --> 38:28.638
 That's exactly what they want.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.308
- Okay, listen, I got a cousin.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.009
He's got a place down the Cape.

38:33.011 --> 38:36.546
  You go down tomorrow, you
  sit by the ocean, relax.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.580
          (inhaling)

38:37.582 --> 38:38.815
     Breathe some salt air.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.450
     It'll clear your head.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.319
      - It's gonna take
      more than salt air

38:42.321 --> 38:44.988
 to get rid of these freaks.

38:44.990 --> 38:49.059
    - Comics have a natural
    self-destructive nature.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.329
  Why else would we get on
  stage in the first place?

38:52.331 --> 38:54.464
    Other than to get laid.

38:54.466 --> 38:57.500
     The thing is it's
     our subconscious that
     will do all sorts

38:57.502 --> 38:59.002
    of things to protect us.

38:59.004 --> 39:02.472
    Which begs the question,
    what are you afraid of?

39:02.474 --> 39:04.107
        - I don't know.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.742
            Failure.

39:05.744 --> 39:06.643
            Success.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.646
     Everything in between.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.481
      - What about bees?

39:11.483 --> 39:15.552
  I have this profound fear
  of all flying insects,

39:17.022 --> 39:21.057
    but especially bees and
    the North American Wasp.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.860
     In fact, I used to see
     a behavioral therapist

39:23.862 --> 39:28.598
 and she had a tiny waist, and
 I end up thinking one day,

39:29.901 --> 39:32.135
  "Well, how do I know
  that she's not with them?

39:32.137 --> 39:33.703
      "Not their queen?"

39:35.040 --> 39:37.707
 Anyway, the first week,
 she puts me alone in a room

39:37.709 --> 39:40.410
 with three or four dead bees.

39:41.113 --> 39:44.814
    And then a week later,
    six or seven live bees.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.484
     And then I come
     back the next month

39:47.486 --> 39:51.855
  and I'm alone in a room
  with a dead horse's head.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.524
I mean the head of a dead horse.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.926
 I have to assume it was dead.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.962
  And I don't like to beat
  a dead horse, but it's not

39:58.964 --> 40:00.463
the worst thing I've ever done.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.867
    (acoustic guitar music)

40:05.103 --> 40:06.803
  - He was amazing, really.

40:06.805 --> 40:10.173
    He had no family, no
    friends, but he claimed

40:10.175 --> 40:13.910
    that he was happy living
    under that bridge.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.813
      Gees, the guy had
      a master's degree.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.082
      He did not have
      to be under there,

40:19.084 --> 40:22.152
     but he wanted to
     be true to himself.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.656
     And I guess I felt
     a connection to him.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.793
        To his passion.

40:31.062 --> 40:34.697
 - Well, with all due
 respect, the guy's an idiot.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.171
     - This might sound
     cold, but I don't know

40:42.607 --> 40:47.043
 if I would've won that award
 if it wasn't for him dying.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.148
    The dying is what really
    made that movie special.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.216
             - Hmm.

40:53.218 --> 40:57.921
  Now I had always heard
  that bird shit was lucky.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.155
          (laughing)

40:59.157 --> 41:00.990
     - [Carla] Guess not.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.661
        (intense music)

41:20.846 --> 41:22.212
      Are you all right?

41:22.214 --> 41:23.480
         - I gotta go.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.747
    I gotta get outta here.
    - Whoa, what is it?

41:24.749 --> 41:25.548
  - I gotta get outta here.
  - Talk to me.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.783
    - It's hard to explain.

41:26.785 --> 41:29.486
     The characters in my
     act have come to life.

41:29.488 --> 41:30.687
          (laughing)

41:30.689 --> 41:32.722
    - They've come to life.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.224
 - That's not the crazy part.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.593
  The crazy part is they're
  trying to kill me.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.794
            - What?

41:37.796 --> 41:38.962
     - Well, they've
     already attacked me.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.196
      My hand, my face.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.264
     They've attacked me.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.799
      - Okay, time out.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.968
  So you're telling me that
  the imaginary characters

41:44.970 --> 41:47.237
     from your act are
     trying to kill you?

41:47.239 --> 41:48.638
            - Yeah.
            - What?

41:58.750 --> 42:00.283
  Oh, my god, they're alive!
  - They're alive.

42:00.285 --> 42:03.553
 They're like the living dead,
 except they were never alive.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.954
          (exhaling)

42:04.956 --> 42:06.523
     - Why didn't you tell
     me about his before?

42:06.525 --> 42:08.191
      - I thought I was
      just going crazy.

42:08.193 --> 42:13.029
     - For god's sakes,
     film festivals love
     stories like this.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.933
     This could get me the
     Pom d'Or at Cannes.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.301
     - Yeah, well it
     could get me killed.

42:18.303 --> 42:20.236
     - Where's my camera?

42:23.608 --> 42:25.842
  Can you tell me your name?

42:26.945 --> 42:29.212
     - 'Course I can, I've
     known him for years.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.648
  Oh, you want me to say it?

42:32.617 --> 42:34.250
         Jimmy Yannel.

42:34.252 --> 42:38.588
     I work for the Water
     and Sewer Department.

42:38.590 --> 42:41.057
  - [Carla] Can you tell me
  a little about yourself?

42:41.059 --> 42:42.191
         - I just did.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.029
      - I love to knit.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.731
 I knitted a scarf, mittens.

42:48.733 --> 42:52.802
    Right now, I'm knittin'
    a bathing suit.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.337
          (laughing)

42:54.339 --> 42:57.774
     - [Carla] So, are you
     upset with Sweeney?

42:57.776 --> 42:58.808
         - Yes, I am.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.779
 He throws us out of his act.

43:02.781 --> 43:06.215
     He moves to Hollywood,
     what do I get?

43:06.217 --> 43:07.650
            Nothin'.

43:07.652 --> 43:09.586
     Knit one, pearl two.

43:10.956 --> 43:11.854
            Nothin'.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.091
          - Sweeney?

43:15.093 --> 43:17.327
     Totally self-centered.

43:17.329 --> 43:20.997
Fascist, misogynist, xenophobic.

43:20.999 --> 43:21.898
             Me?

43:22.901 --> 43:24.901
    I'm riding a Nomad bike.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.736
     I've got it right in
     the back of my Hummer.

43:26.738 --> 43:29.138
I'm doing a 60 minute bike ride

43:29.140 --> 43:31.874
to save the endangered mosquito.

43:33.244 --> 43:34.344
          (slapping)

43:34.346 --> 43:35.278
         That's a bee.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.813
     Don't even go there.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.081
  - [Carla] Are you married?

43:38.083 --> 43:40.049
  Do you have a girlfriend?

43:40.051 --> 43:41.784
        - No, I do not.

43:41.786 --> 43:45.855
  But in 1974, I kissed
  Marie Akarelli on the lips

43:46.925 --> 43:50.259
     for one full hour,
     and I can still taste

43:51.296 --> 43:53.863
 her beautiful Marlboro breath.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.401
    - I've been in Sweeney's
    act for 20 years.

43:58.403 --> 44:03.239
 It's like a prison sentence,
 but without the prison sex.

44:05.877 --> 44:08.277
 - Why do I wanna kill Sweeney?

44:08.279 --> 44:10.413
      Well, let me tell
      ya, sweetheart.

44:10.415 --> 44:13.016
  Maybe 'cause I can't
  stand the son of a bitch.

44:13.018 --> 44:15.718
Maybe because he's got no balls.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.921
  Now, is that clear enough
  for ya, or would you like

44:18.923 --> 44:20.823
     to spray Windex on it?

44:21.393 --> 44:24.827
     (slow acoustic music)

45:08.907 --> 45:10.306
        - What the fuck?

45:15.280 --> 45:18.281
      (odd violin music)

45:27.992 --> 45:29.225
      What do you want?

45:29.227 --> 45:30.993
      - It's not what
      we want, Sweeney.

45:30.995 --> 45:32.462
     It's what you want.

45:33.498 --> 45:36.065
 - You want to leave us behind.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.900
     - Hey listen, I just
     wanna grow, okay?

45:37.902 --> 45:39.135
        - [Fitzy] Grow?

45:39.137 --> 45:41.871
      - How much taller
      do you wanna be?

45:41.873 --> 45:43.473
    - Look at all this sand!

45:43.475 --> 45:46.342
  I better start sweepin'
  now, even though it's not

45:46.344 --> 45:48.444
     a Monday or a Tuesday.

45:48.446 --> 45:51.380
 - If you would just like put
 us back in your act, Sweeney,

45:51.382 --> 45:53.449
     we would like, just
     like disappear.

45:53.451 --> 45:56.085
     - Look, I can't put
     you back in my act.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.755
 If I put you back in my act,
 then I won't go to Hollywood,

45:58.757 --> 46:00.289
 I won't get the cable special.

46:00.291 --> 46:02.425
     - My frickin' heart
     bleeds for ya.

46:02.427 --> 46:04.994
      - I'm tellin' your
      mother, Sweeney.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.996
    - So much goddamn sand!

46:07.999 --> 46:09.532
 - Look, it's not you, it's me.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.134
        I love you guys.

46:12.237 --> 46:14.403
    Come on, we had a lot
    of great times together,

46:14.405 --> 46:15.471
         but it's over.

46:15.473 --> 46:16.973
          Let it go!

46:16.975 --> 46:18.908
  - I guess that's it then.

46:18.910 --> 46:20.510
     - Okay, like goodbye?

46:21.813 --> 46:23.379
      - Yeah, it's over.

46:23.381 --> 46:24.547
        Let's kill 'im.

46:24.549 --> 46:25.848
      Come on, Sweeney!

46:25.850 --> 46:28.417
 Put 'em up, put up your dukes!

46:28.419 --> 46:31.154
        (intense music)

46:32.323 --> 46:34.524
      - Put up my dukes?
      - Kill 'im, Fitzy.

46:34.526 --> 46:38.161
 - [Marshall] 'Scuse me, rude
 to leave before we kill you.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.496
          (thudding)

46:44.903 --> 46:48.137
     - [Mary Ellen] Jesus,
     Mary and Joseph.

46:52.277 --> 46:55.244
      - Now I know how
      a baby seal feels.

46:58.049 --> 47:00.583
         (chime music)

47:01.519 --> 47:03.085
         - He's dead.

47:03.087 --> 47:05.254
 I told him buckle your helmet.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.023
         - Holy shit!

47:07.025 --> 47:09.058
     You killed Marshall.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.259
     - I didn't kill 'im.

47:10.261 --> 47:11.527
            He fell.

47:11.529 --> 47:13.513
      - [Mary Ellen] He
      must be on crack.

47:13.514 --> 47:15.498
  - Let's kill Sweeney,
  then we go somewhere else

47:15.500 --> 47:16.966
      to bury the body.

47:16.968 --> 47:20.369
    - Kick him in the balls,
    if you can find 'em.

47:20.371 --> 47:22.505
     - Now it's your turn
     to die, Sweeney.

47:22.507 --> 47:27.109
 All life started in the ocean,
 and you're gonna die in it.

47:27.111 --> 47:28.511
        - Wait a minute.

47:29.581 --> 47:31.614
     (happy piano music)

47:31.616 --> 47:33.049
          That's it.

47:33.051 --> 47:34.617
      I created you all.

47:35.553 --> 47:38.921
    All those nights on
    stage, all those shows.

47:38.923 --> 47:40.156
         I created you.

47:41.259 --> 47:45.361
     You don't get rid of
     me, I get rid of you.

47:45.363 --> 47:46.963
      - He is on crack.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.297
        - This is over.

47:49.968 --> 47:53.569
  I want you outta my life,
  I want you outta my act.

47:53.571 --> 47:57.206
    I don't wanna be a
    local celebrity anymore.

47:58.643 --> 48:01.544
I wanna be a big time celebrity.

48:01.546 --> 48:03.512
    I wanna go to Hollywood.

48:03.514 --> 48:05.014
     I wanna get a sitcom.

48:05.016 --> 48:07.216
 I wanna get a cable special.

48:07.218 --> 48:09.919
    Shit, I wanna get cable.

48:09.921 --> 48:14.257
 I wanna be on the Celebrity
 Family Feud, the Pyramid.

48:14.259 --> 48:17.393
      I wanna dance with
      the fuckin' stars!

48:20.298 --> 48:24.233
 - Sweet Mary and Joseph, he
 has lost his freakin' mind.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.435
      - I don't want you
      people anymore.

48:26.437 --> 48:27.670
  I want you outta my life.

48:27.672 --> 48:29.338
Go back to where you came from.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.641
  I want you gone for good.

48:31.643 --> 48:34.277
          (laughing)

48:34.279 --> 48:35.912
    - That's what you want?

48:35.914 --> 48:37.179
            - Yeah!

48:37.181 --> 48:38.514
     That's what I want.

48:38.516 --> 48:40.549
     You're outta my life.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.451
     You're outta my act.

48:42.453 --> 48:43.352
            Go away.

48:45.390 --> 48:46.355
         It is over.

48:47.659 --> 48:51.093
     (upbeat string music)

49:05.576 --> 49:06.575
     (record scratching)

49:06.577 --> 49:08.945
    - Sweeney kicked us out.

49:08.947 --> 49:10.947
     What are you gonna do?

49:10.949 --> 49:13.282
  That's what the guy wants.

49:13.284 --> 49:17.053
     Sometimes people gotta
     learn the hard way.

49:18.256 --> 49:21.657
    (upbeat acoustic music)

49:29.634 --> 49:31.734
  ¶ And I'm takin' my time ¶

49:31.736 --> 49:34.103
    ¶ I'm waiting for you ¶

49:34.105 --> 49:36.605
    ¶ Words can't describe ¶

49:36.607 --> 49:39.075
    ¶ The things that I do ¶

49:39.077 --> 49:42.278
     ¶ Instead of waiting ¶

49:42.280 --> 49:44.680
 ¶ I slip out from the door ¶

49:44.682 --> 49:47.350
     ¶ The sun is shinin' ¶

49:47.352 --> 49:50.086
    ¶ Brighter than before ¶

49:50.088 --> 49:52.655
    ¶ I'm tired of waiting ¶

49:52.657 --> 49:55.224
  ¶ Waiting for your touch ¶

49:55.226 --> 49:57.994
      ¶ No hesitating ¶

49:57.996 --> 49:59.695
     ¶ No more, thanks ¶

49:59.697 --> 50:02.098
        ¶ Prima donna ¶

50:02.100 --> 50:04.500
     ¶ You know I wanna ¶

50:04.502 --> 50:06.769
  ¶ Your drop-top Mercedes ¶

50:06.771 --> 50:09.071
         ¶ Lipstick ¶

50:11.242 --> 50:14.310
 - Well, I always thought I'd
 transition into another kind

50:14.312 --> 50:17.580
      of work, but just
      never happened.

50:17.582 --> 50:19.482
     Comedy's like a curse.

50:19.484 --> 50:22.752
     It's not that easy to
     just get rid of it.

50:25.223 --> 50:29.358
 - So what happens if you
 don't get the comedy special?

50:29.360 --> 50:31.427
        - Life goes on.

50:31.429 --> 50:35.431
    I will always be able to
    put food on the table.

50:35.433 --> 50:38.034
     Dishes, hoo, that's
     another thing.

50:38.036 --> 50:39.668
         (chuckling)

50:39.670 --> 50:43.105
 I've worked hard to establish
 a reputation locally,

50:43.107 --> 50:44.206
         so I'm just--

50:44.208 --> 50:46.075
        (phone ringing)

50:46.077 --> 50:46.742
            Hold on.

50:48.646 --> 50:49.745
     - [George] Sweeney,
     it's me, yeah.

50:49.747 --> 50:51.313
 I got you a gig for tonight.

50:51.315 --> 50:53.649
  Yeah, it's not much money,
  it's two hours away.

50:53.651 --> 50:55.084
        Some PTO thing.

50:55.086 --> 50:56.819
    But at least it'll get
    you away for the night.

50:56.821 --> 50:57.820
         You want it?

50:57.822 --> 50:58.788
            - Sure.

50:58.790 --> 51:00.322
      I gotta go, sorry.

51:00.324 --> 51:01.557
        - [Carla] Where?

51:01.559 --> 51:03.292
         - I gotta gig.

51:03.294 --> 51:06.429
 - [Carla] Oh, well, I'll come.

51:06.431 --> 51:08.731
  - No, it's not a gig gig.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.099
        It's a shit gig.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.600
     It's a two-hour drive.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.069
            - Great.

51:13.071 --> 51:14.270
            - Great?
            - Yeah.

51:15.273 --> 51:16.739
          - Really?
          - Mm-hm.

51:18.843 --> 51:22.545
    (acoustic country music)

51:25.850 --> 51:28.117
     So, is this how you
     get most of your work?

51:28.119 --> 51:29.185
         Last minute?

51:29.187 --> 51:30.653
             - No.

51:30.655 --> 51:31.787
     Yeah, well, sometimes.

51:31.789 --> 51:34.123
        Sometimes, yeah.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.724
          (laughing)

51:35.726 --> 51:38.360
      So Justin is with
      the dad tonight?

51:38.362 --> 51:39.662
        - [Carla] Yeah.

51:41.866 --> 51:42.765
          - Divorce.

51:44.869 --> 51:47.236
 Now that has gotta be tough.

51:47.238 --> 51:49.105
     - Well, it's not easy.

51:50.108 --> 51:50.773
            - Yeah.

51:51.843 --> 51:53.776
      (throat clearing)

51:53.778 --> 51:54.877
         What happened?

51:54.879 --> 51:56.145
     Did he cheat on ya?

51:56.147 --> 51:57.613
 - [Carla] No, of course not.

51:57.615 --> 51:58.848
  - Oh, you cheated on him?

51:58.850 --> 52:00.116
             - No.

52:00.651 --> 52:02.118
          We just...

52:02.120 --> 52:02.818
             - Ah.

52:03.688 --> 52:05.721
        You grew apart.

52:05.723 --> 52:07.256
             - No.

52:07.258 --> 52:09.125
 We just didn't grow, period.

52:09.127 --> 52:11.460
 So what about you, Sweeney?

52:12.630 --> 52:14.463
Do you have a significant other?

52:14.465 --> 52:18.367
 Have you ever been
 engaged, married, divorced?

52:21.739 --> 52:23.739
     - Let's just say
     mistakes were made.

52:23.741 --> 52:26.242
          (laughing)

52:40.825 --> 52:43.009
          (laughing)

52:43.010 --> 52:45.194
     In July, I'm running
     a 100-yard dash

52:45.196 --> 52:47.429
  for premature ejaculators.

52:50.568 --> 52:53.502
 A little history of the race.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.204
    It began as a marathon.

52:55.206 --> 52:56.839
          (laughing)

52:56.841 --> 52:58.941
     And it became a half
     marathon, and then...

52:58.943 --> 53:01.610
  Because they're premat...

53:01.612 --> 53:04.580
Do you ever get outta the house?

53:04.582 --> 53:05.881
          (laughing)

53:05.883 --> 53:07.883
     You're the comedian
     on a cruise ship

53:07.885 --> 53:11.287
  and people come up to you
  and say, "Oh, you stay

53:11.289 --> 53:13.189
         "on the ship?"

53:13.191 --> 53:13.956
          (laughing)

53:13.958 --> 53:15.224
            Oh, no.

53:15.226 --> 53:17.493
    I swim next to the ship.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.962
     And then when
     we're 150 miles out

53:19.964 --> 53:22.565
    in the shark-infested
    water, they scoop me up,

53:22.567 --> 53:25.568
    they dry me off, I tell
    a few stupid jokes,

53:25.570 --> 53:27.536
 then they throw me overboard.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.538
     Then I gotta swim
     back to catch my plane

53:29.540 --> 53:31.840
     for the big gig here.

53:31.842 --> 53:35.277
     (slow acoustic music)

53:37.682 --> 53:39.248
         This is Carla.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.250
     She's a film maker.

53:41.252 --> 53:43.986
    She's got a documentary,
    won a bunch of awards.

53:43.988 --> 53:45.754
         Check it out.

53:45.756 --> 53:48.257
          (laughing)

54:10.248 --> 54:11.013
          This okay?

54:11.015 --> 54:12.248
        - Oh yeah, yeah.

54:12.250 --> 54:13.015
          I'm fine.

54:13.017 --> 54:14.683
     Thank you, so much.

54:14.685 --> 54:15.684
         Good night.

54:16.921 --> 54:19.255
    - I'm not goin' to bed.

54:19.257 --> 54:21.357
     I'm gonna sit up
     and watch you sleep.

54:21.359 --> 54:22.858
          (laughing)

54:22.860 --> 54:25.327
     - I don't know if I've
     ever told you this

54:25.329 --> 54:28.397
      but I think you're
      really talented.

54:28.399 --> 54:31.400
- No, you have not told me that.

54:31.402 --> 54:32.301
          Thank you.

54:33.671 --> 54:35.904
 - Did you always know that
 you wanted to be a comedian?

54:35.906 --> 54:37.406
        - I don't know.

54:37.408 --> 54:39.008
     Yeah, well, I always
     made people laugh.

54:39.010 --> 54:41.844
It's like school, family, jobs.

54:42.913 --> 54:45.581
     But bein' normal,
     now that's different.

54:45.583 --> 54:47.049
 Phew, that's the challenge.

54:47.051 --> 54:49.451
 - Well, you're kind of normal.

54:49.453 --> 54:52.288
     - Well, I don't feel
     that way lately.

54:52.290 --> 54:54.356
     So that's why I like
     to get on stage.

54:54.358 --> 54:57.359
      I get on stage, I
      feel comfortable.

54:58.963 --> 55:02.965
  But I don't really know
  if that's what I wanna do.

55:02.967 --> 55:06.402
     - Well, I was just
     wondering, Sweeney,

55:07.405 --> 55:09.738
 if maybe you wanna do this?

55:20.051 --> 55:22.885
- Yeah, that's what I wanna do.

55:35.399 --> 55:36.598
          (laughing)

55:36.600 --> 55:38.000
             - Hey.

55:38.002 --> 55:39.668
     You runnin' out on me?

55:39.670 --> 55:41.804
      - Oh, no I didn't
      wanna wake you up.

55:41.806 --> 55:44.440
  Yeah, I'm goin' out to get
  some coffee and bagels.

55:44.442 --> 55:45.674
             - Mm.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.676
     Do you want me to just
     make something here?

55:47.678 --> 55:49.111
            - Sure.

55:49.113 --> 55:50.346
 Do you have any food on you?

55:50.348 --> 55:52.381
    - No.
    - I don't have any food.

55:52.383 --> 55:53.682
     I don't have any food.

55:53.684 --> 55:54.516
     I'll get some bagels.

55:54.518 --> 55:55.417
            - Okay.

55:55.419 --> 56:00.022
    Hey, do you happen to
    know where my pants are?

56:00.024 --> 56:02.424
         - Your pants?
         - My pants.

56:02.426 --> 56:03.792
  - Oh, I sold 'em on eBay.

56:03.794 --> 56:04.693
         - Not again.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.994
          (laughing)

56:05.996 --> 56:07.396
     - No, here they are.

56:07.398 --> 56:08.597
  I didn't think you'd mind.

56:08.599 --> 56:10.399
     - Thank you, Sweeney.

56:12.136 --> 56:13.936
          (knocking)

56:13.938 --> 56:14.870
     - [Justin] Sweeney!

56:14.872 --> 56:16.105
  - Oh my god, it's Justin.

56:16.107 --> 56:18.841
I don't want him to see me here.

56:20.911 --> 56:23.045
      - Justin, what are
      you doin' here?

56:23.047 --> 56:24.646
     - You were supposed
     to come to my class.

56:24.648 --> 56:25.881
         - Oh, shit!

56:25.883 --> 56:27.082
          I forgot.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.484
     - I had to tell my
     teacher you were dead,

56:28.486 --> 56:29.985
     that you died in a hot
     air balloon accident.

56:29.987 --> 56:31.053
            - Dead?

56:31.055 --> 56:32.020
            Hot air?

56:32.022 --> 56:33.522
     Are you shitting me?

56:33.524 --> 56:35.391
      A hot air balloon?

56:35.393 --> 56:37.126
 - I thought we were buddies.

56:37.128 --> 56:38.093
You let me down, you're a jerk.

56:38.095 --> 56:39.661
         - I'm sorry.

56:39.663 --> 56:40.996
     - [Justin] Here's my
     stupid assignment.

56:40.998 --> 56:42.064
 I thought you'd wanna read it.

56:42.066 --> 56:43.098
  I don't want it any more.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.400
             - Wow.

56:45.136 --> 56:47.002
     - My dad's waiting.

56:47.004 --> 56:47.903
          - Justin?

56:49.106 --> 56:50.406
            Justin?

56:51.142 --> 56:53.041
     I'll make it up to ya!

56:58.949 --> 56:59.848
             Shit.

57:01.719 --> 57:02.951
  - Hey, I'm sorry, Sweeney.

57:02.953 --> 57:04.486
      He didn't mean it.

57:04.488 --> 57:06.422
     Now I'll talk to him.

57:06.424 --> 57:09.091
        (birds chirping)

57:09.093 --> 57:13.629
  - I think I'm quittin'
  the real estate business.

57:13.631 --> 57:16.665
Once you get this cable special,

57:16.667 --> 57:19.034
 I think I'll be able to quit.

57:19.036 --> 57:21.503
 - Are you sure you don't
 wanna sit down and eat that?

57:21.505 --> 57:26.575
 - No, my doctor says I should
 be gettin' more exercise.

57:27.611 --> 57:30.145
     - Do you wanna
     hear summin' crazy?

57:30.147 --> 57:33.182
    - I have heard a lot
    of crazy things lately.

57:33.184 --> 57:35.117
- I think I'm fallin' for Carla.

57:35.119 --> 57:36.218
          - Really?

57:37.488 --> 57:38.554
         That's good.

57:39.457 --> 57:40.456
         I like her.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.658
        - Hey, no moves.

57:43.727 --> 57:45.127
     You know how you
     are with the ladies.

57:45.129 --> 57:46.161
          No moves.

57:46.163 --> 57:48.497
 - My hands are full already.

57:48.499 --> 57:50.532
 I wouldn't move on your move.

57:50.534 --> 57:52.000
  Who taught you the moves?

57:52.002 --> 57:53.836
    - You did, you're right.
    - I taught you my moves,

57:53.838 --> 57:55.103
     now you use my moves.

57:55.105 --> 57:56.205
  I would never use my moves

57:56.207 --> 57:58.173
     against your moves.
     - Okay, I got it.

57:58.175 --> 57:59.074
          Thank you.

58:00.511 --> 58:02.811
          (laughing)

58:03.914 --> 58:07.516
     So, I went to the
     Museum of Fine Arts.

58:07.518 --> 58:10.118
    First of all, some of
    the paintings are as old

58:10.120 --> 58:12.521
 as the people that work there.

58:12.523 --> 58:14.623
 But the art, it's abstract.

58:16.527 --> 58:18.527
  So I'm lookin' at this one
  painting, just for like

58:18.529 --> 58:20.963
     an hour and half, I'm
     saying, "Is it a man?

58:20.965 --> 58:22.564
        "Is it a woman?"

58:23.267 --> 58:24.900
And that was just the bathroom.

58:24.902 --> 58:27.135
          (laughing)

58:27.137 --> 58:29.505
          (clapping)

58:29.507 --> 58:31.974
  - Sweeney, you killed it!
  - Nice job, Sweeney.

58:31.976 --> 58:33.208
     - Good set, Sweeney.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.977
      - Thank you, thank
      you, thank you.

58:34.979 --> 58:37.012
  - And you didn't even
  have to use your crutches.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.580
      I mean characters.

58:45.589 --> 58:48.857
    - You my friend are
    ready for this audition.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.158
  I can see it in your eyes.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.227
- Please don't look in my eyes.

58:52.228 --> 58:54.295
  - And you haven't heard
  from your you know who's?

58:54.298 --> 58:57.132
- No, I told you, they are gone.

58:57.134 --> 58:58.700
            - Okay.

58:58.702 --> 59:01.670
    This is gonna be a
    defining moment for you.

59:01.672 --> 59:04.640
      Every comic has a
      defining moment.

59:04.642 --> 59:07.075
     Mine was when I quit.

59:07.077 --> 59:08.777
      Oh, I love comedy.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.245
     It just wasn't for me.

59:10.247 --> 59:13.582
 So I guess I live vicariously
 through Sweeney now.

59:13.584 --> 59:17.019
     The recognition, the
     one-night stands.

59:17.021 --> 59:18.153
            The 15%.

59:19.657 --> 59:23.025
 - [Carla] So, has Sweeney
 ever had a steady girlfriend?

59:23.027 --> 59:24.993
      - Ah, not as long
      as I've known him.

59:24.995 --> 59:28.196
     All his girlfriends
     have been unsteady.

59:28.198 --> 59:29.264
  Can I ask you a question?

59:29.266 --> 59:30.165
        - [Carla] Sure.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.333
     - Do you rent or own?

59:31.335 --> 59:33.235
          (laughing)

59:33.237 --> 59:35.671
 - So, my mother still
 sends me money in the mail,

59:35.673 --> 59:38.006
     which is weird because
     I'm 31 years old.

59:38.008 --> 59:39.308
          (laughing)

59:39.310 --> 59:40.642
     And we live together.

59:40.644 --> 59:42.778
          (laughing)

59:42.780 --> 59:46.148
     My mother had me when
     she was 17 years old.

59:46.150 --> 59:48.250
    A junior in high school.

59:48.252 --> 59:50.686
     My father was older.

59:50.688 --> 59:51.820
        He was a senior.

59:51.822 --> 59:52.888
          (laughing)

59:52.890 --> 59:53.855
          He was 70.

59:53.857 --> 59:56.158
          (laughing)

59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.629
 - So do you have any pre-show
 rituals that you go through?

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:03.732
     - Sometimes I like
     to sit undisturbed,

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.734
    quiet, without talking.

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.639
         - Hey!
         - Hey Gene!

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:11.974
     - Hey, George, George!

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:12.808
     Sit down, sit down.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.875
      How are you, baby?

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.010
How's the real estate business?

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:16.078
 - Ah, it's good, it's good.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.012
          - Really?

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.013
  I hear real estate sucks!

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:18.947
          (laughing)

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.082
        - Yeah, it does.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.316
    Hey, how's that
    beautiful wife of yours?

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.618
             - Oh!

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.952
    That broad's leavin' me.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.354
         - That slut.

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:26.688
    She lookin' for a condo?

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.256
          (laughing)

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:29.124
     - Oh, look it there.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.125
     This guy, this guy!

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.727
        I love this guy!

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:32.661
          - Sweeney.

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:33.895
  Are you kidding, Sweeney.

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.263
     - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.298
      Sweeney, Sweeney,
      it's of course.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.666
My mind went blank for a second.

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:39.768
     A couple of cocktails,
     and you know.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:40.402
      Oh, look who's it.

01:00:40.404 --> 01:00:41.803
         Hey, Heather!

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:42.771
      How are ya, baby?
      - Hi, Gene!

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:44.006
- Oh, how are you, sweetie pie?

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:44.840
     - [Heather] It's
     so good to see you.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:45.807
     - Oh, you look great.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:46.775
 Doesn't she look great, huh?

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.877
  - Hey, what about my hug?

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:49.745
             - Ah.

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:50.412
          That guy!

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:51.647
        I love that guy!

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:52.347
             Is it?

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:53.248
          Funny guy.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.082
          (laughing)

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:54.916
            Come on.

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:56.118
         Gonna go on.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:56.952
     Come on, I can't
     wait to see your set.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:57.653
      I'll see ya later.

01:00:57.655 --> 01:00:58.420
          Funny guy.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:00:59.788
        I like that guy.

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:02.958
    - Am I that forgettable.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.694
     - Oh, he just couldn't
     think of your name.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:08.897
     Sometimes I can't
     think of your name.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.233
          (laughing)

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:16.672
- My mother's only 59 and she's
already starting to lose it.

01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:17.673
     You know what I mean?

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:19.241
 She keeps forgetting things.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:21.109
     She called me up the
     other day and asked me

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:23.011
     what an orgasm was.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.715
  And I was like, "Mom,
  it's that euphoric feeling

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:30.452
     "that you get whenever
     Dad leaves the house."

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:32.688
          (laughing)

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.790
          (clapping)

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.694
- I'm gonna do about five
minutes between you and Heather.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.329
             Okay?

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.963
  - Yeah, don't introduce
  me as the Character King.

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:45.133
     - Yeah, yeah, whatever
     you want Sweeney.

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.903
 - I used to work in an office.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.172
 Constant sexual harassment.

01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:52.841
     Of course, most of it
     was coming from me.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:54.109
          (laughing)

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:55.911
     Hey, Kevin, you
     look a little tired.

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:57.145
         Late night?

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:58.714
      You and the misses
      gettin' it on?

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:00.716
 What's your favorite position?

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:01.383
             Mine?

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:03.151
          Watching.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.988
     Anyway, you people
     have cheered me up.

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.757
     Thank you very much.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:10.092
         Good night.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.260
          (clapping)

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.763
          (cheering)

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.934
 - Great fucking set, Heather.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.936
 That new joke totally killed.

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:21.937
         - Good set.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.073
          - Thanks.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.210
     I left a few laughs
     out there for ya.

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:31.480
          (laughing)

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:33.515
 - Give it up for Heather
 Chase, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:34.783
         Let her know!

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:35.484
         Heather Chase!

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:36.918
          Very sexy.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.520
    Very sexy Heather Chase.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.789
 But my girlfriend, not sexy.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:42.357
     No, not sexy at all!

01:02:42.359 --> 01:02:44.760
      Listen, she farts
      when she has sex.

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:46.027
          (groaning)

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:47.529
          (laughing)

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.131
     At least that's what
     her father says.

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:53.769
          (groaning)
          (laughing)

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:56.805
    All right, on that note,
    ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:58.840
     your final performer
     for the evening.

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:00.776
     He's a local legend.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.879
    Please give it up for
    Boston's Character King!

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:04.780
            Sweeney!

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:06.848
          (cheering)

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.049
 - I told you not to say that.

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:09.251
     - Yeah, yeah, whatever
     you need, Sweeney.

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:10.819
     - Hey, how are you?

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:11.953
        Good to see you.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:12.921
         How ya doin'?

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:14.523
        You look great.

01:03:14.525 --> 01:03:19.795
 I know what you're thinkin',
 but I am not as old as I look.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:21.930
     I did a lot of drugs
     in high school.

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.131
          (laughing)

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.132
          Last week.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.102
          (laughing)

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:28.069
         I eat meat.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.306
 Let me put it in another way.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.141
     I hate fucking vegans.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.911
          (laughing)

01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:37.479
     I like to get up
     early in the morning.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:40.282
 I work out for an hour,
 that way, I get it over with

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:41.283
     for the whole year.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.819
          (laughing)

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.589
 Hey, can you be a little
 more careful with my career?

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.324
    This is a big audition.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.560
      - I'm just tryin'
      to make a livin'.

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:52.561
         - Oh, shit!

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.096
          - Oh, man.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:56.097
     Is he gonna be okay?

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:57.399
        - I don't know.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:00.969
          (snapping)

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.505
 Give me a shot of anything.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:08.076
 - Okay, anyway, this guy
 comes up to me in the subway,

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:12.581
 he says to me, "Give me a buck
 and a half or I'll touch ya."

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:15.183
    So, I let him touch me.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.952
      I'm a lonely guy.
      - Coming through,

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:18.220
    coming through, come on.

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:19.154
      Pick up the feet,
      pick up your feet.

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:20.488
Coming through, coming through.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.859
This won't take long, funny man.

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:25.427
        Coming through.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:28.363
 - Jesus, I need a shovel man.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:32.133
 You can't sweep a street
 without a broom and a shovel.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.002
    This is a five-man job.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.904
    I'm doin' all five jobs.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.539
     - [Man] Hey, why don't
     you say somethin'?

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.507
- Hey, what's your problem, pal?

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:40.876
     You see what I gotta
     deal with, huh?

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:42.344
          (laughing)

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:44.579
     All right, what were
     we talkin' about?

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.581
    - You were talkin' about
    your miserable life.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:47.983
         - Oh, shit.

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:50.552
     - Why don't you talk
     about how you treat

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.387
     your friends, clown?

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.889
             Huh?

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:55.190
        - Hey, fuck you!

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:56.424
         - Fuck you!

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.893
      Oh, that's clever.

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.160
         Jesus Christ.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:00.629
        Where's my pen?

01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:03.331
     How long did it take
     ya to write that one?

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.600
     Wow, Shakespeare
     got nothin' on you.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:07.035
         James Joyce.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:09.905
     My god, he's green
     with freakin' envy.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.007
          (laughing)

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:22.117
         - All right.

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:27.489
     That's been my time.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:30.058
          Thank you.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.295

     ¶ Each passing day ¶

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:05.560
- [Carla] I'm so sorry, Sweeney.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.531
 - Can you turn that thing off?

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:16.304

            - What?

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.006
     - [George] Sweeney?

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:51.740
      Yeah, it's George.

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:53.541
          - I know.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.310
     - [George] Yeah, I
     talked to Gene today.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:57.078
  He was a little hung over.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.214
      But basically, he
      really liked ya.

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:00.715
     He knows you're funny.

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.250
 He knew the crowd was tired.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:04.552
  He's seen ya kill before.

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:06.755
    He's a pretty sharp guy.

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:10.058
     They're givin' the
     special to Heather.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.693
     I got a gig for ya.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.578
    It's at a Crusty Pizza.

01:07:13.579 --> 01:07:15.462
 Three-hour drive and
 there's a free slice in it.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:16.364
             - No.

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:32.080
             - Hey?

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:37.118
    Do you wanna go outside
    and get some fresh air?

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.154
     - Hey, can you turn
     that camera off?

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:40.221
         - It is off.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:46.828
 - Wow, you wanted me to fail.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:47.729
            - What?

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:51.099
    - For your stupid movie.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.101
     That's how it works.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.669
 - What are you talking about?

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:56.604
    - You said it yourself.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.107
 The other movie, the guy
 who lives under the bridge,

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:02.710
     if he doesn't die, the
     movie doesn't work.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:06.347
     If I don't bomb, this
     movie doesn't work.

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.183
         - Oh, my god!

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:09.384
     Are you blaming me?

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:10.685
  - I'm not blaming anyone.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:13.521
     I'm just saying, you
     wanted me to fail.

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:14.823
             - Wow!

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:16.725
     You know what, pal?

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.626
 I'm not one of your imaginary
 characters that's trying

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.828
         to kill you.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.696
I'm actually trying to help you.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.131
 - You're trying to help me?
 - Yes.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:24.799
      - By making me
      look like a loser?

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:27.734
  - You know what, Sweeney,
  there is somebody

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.404
     that you can blame.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.272
             - Oh.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:37.712
      (slow sitar music)

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.886
            Steven.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.354
     - [Steven] Sweeney.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:47.788
     - [Sweeney] What are
     you doin' out here?

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.591
     - Lookin' for my dog.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:50.892
      - You have a dog?

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.462
     Hey listen, now that
     you're here, I'm goin'

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.863
     though all this stuff.

01:08:55.866 --> 01:08:59.533
 This woman just walked out
 on me, I'm bombin' on stage,

01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:02.837
      I want you to give
      me some advice.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:05.206
     - My advice to you
     is to stop thinkin'.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.841
  You're thinkin' too much.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:09.176
     You take all this
     information, everyone,

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:10.879
     all this infinite
     amount of information.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.412
     The brain has no end.

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:14.165
  It'll take everything in.

01:09:14.166 --> 01:09:15.916
     You need to stop
     new information,
     take the information

01:09:15.919 --> 01:09:18.720
 that's already in your head,
 meaning your whole life,

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.654
 and then push it to the side.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.323
You need to have no information.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.524
  You need to have a blank.

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:24.826
     Not just nothin'
     for a little while.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.261
            - Blank?

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:27.562
     - Blank, nothin' in
     your head at all.

01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:29.663
     A few seconds here,
     a few seconds there.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:30.899
        It all adds up.

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:33.167
        To me, I do it.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.435
 It adds up to about 15 minutes
 a year where I have nothin'

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:36.671
         in my head.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:37.705
     - Whoa, whoa, whoa,
     15 minutes a year?

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:38.872
        - [Steven] Yes.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:39.941
      - I need help now.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.676
    I want your advice now!

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:44.679
 - That's the perfect example
 of what I'm talkin' about.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.482
     You're analyzing a
     year, now, 15 minutes.

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.216
     You see all the
     thinking you just did.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:50.551
     You think too much.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:51.953
  You need to have nothin'.

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:53.921
  Believe me, if I didn't
  do it, I would be insane.

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:55.223
          It works.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.192
            Freddy?

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:01.963
     - Steven, you don't
     have a dog, do you?

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:07.936
        - Here, Freddy!

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:10.939
            Freddy?

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:13.908
            Freddy?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.779
          (knocking)

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:18.913
          - Sweeney?

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:20.615
            Open up.

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:22.617
 Come on, man, we gotta talk.

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:24.352
        Do I smell gas?

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:25.987
        - Bombing sucks.

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.555
         So I've heard.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:28.623
         I'm kidding.

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:31.426
     We've all been there.

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:33.828
 But if you bomb, you move on.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.398
  If you keep bombing, you
  move on to another career.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.466
          (knocking)

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:39.867
    - You bomb, you move on!

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:41.736
     You bomb, you move on!

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.640
    Hi, I found some pizza.

01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:46.908
        - You found it?

01:10:48.245 --> 01:10:48.977
     - I thought you had
     your head in the oven.

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:50.912
  - What do you want, Frank?

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.280
          (exhaling)

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:53.548
 - I gotta show you somethin'.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.949
     You are gonna shit.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.352
  You want some pizza first?

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:02.690
          (clapping)

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:04.525
         - Oh, my god.
         - Yeah.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:08.663
  - Sweepin' shit on the
  street is a lot like life.

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:15.270
 Especially if you're life is
 sweepin' shit on the street.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:17.472
          (laughing)

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:18.773
     - He's not even funny.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:19.674
            - Wait.

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:22.310
         There's more.

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:30.818
 - When I was young, I used to
 love to listen to the Beatles.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:32.654
     Not the band, insects.

01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:34.289
          (laughing)

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:37.325
     Now, for music, I
     loved Frank Sinatra.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:40.428
     Oh, god, when he
     would sing "My Way,"

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:43.965
     I'd say, "You can have
     your way with my way,

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.833
  "and I can go both ways."

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:48.336
          (laughing)

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.003
             Yeah.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:50.972
         - Funny stuff.
         - Huh?

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.373
         - No bullshit.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:55.310
 - You're not gonna believe it.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:56.511
         There's more.
         - More?

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:58.079
         - Watch.
         - Jesus, god.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:04.519
     - I went to Catholic
     school with the nuns.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:08.423
 I was talkin', they
 suspended me for three days,

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:10.425
  from the freakin' ceilin'.

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:12.660
          (laughing)

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.962
          (clapping)

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:18.800
      - Go back to where
      you came from.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:21.035
 You ruined my audition,
 you're not gonna ruin my life.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:22.537
            Get out.

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:24.372
 - I got news for ya, Sweeney.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:28.343
  You already kicked us
  outta your life, 'member?

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:32.380
     You kicked us out, now
     we're kickin' you out.

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:33.948
     - You ready, Fitzy?

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:35.083
     - Sure, sweetheart.

01:12:35.085 --> 01:12:37.118
She wants a few tips on comedy.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.355
     - Wait a minute, you
     don't kick me out.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:41.823
 You don't exist without me.

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:44.726
    - That's the funny thing
    about this magical shit.

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.361
     It's unpredictable.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:48.830
         Come on, baby.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:56.838
        (waves crashing)

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.039
     - Here's somethin'.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.475
    10 years ago, according
    to Geraldo Rivera,

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:03.978
  three Buddhist monks
  from a novel came to life

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.047
      while he was doin'
      a story in Tibet.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:07.582
     - Yeah, but did they
     try to kill 'im?

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:09.650
     - It says here, yeah.

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.786
 Even the monks hate Geraldo.

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:14.088
- Maybe that's what I should do.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:17.558
     Maybe I should try to
     kill my characters.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:20.027
         - You serious?

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.131
     - It's not a bad idea.

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:26.134
They don't exist anyway, right?

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:27.568
          - Sweeney?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.737
  Don't do anything stupid.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.039
          (coughing)

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:36.411
        (mower growling)

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:38.846
  - Listen, there's nothin'
  I can do about it.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.181
      My hands are tied.

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:42.116
     They want Heather,
     they don't want you.

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:43.651
     - Listen to me,
     just ask them again.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:44.886
          Ask them--

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:45.820
      - I've asked them
      a million times.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.021
    She's doin' a good job.

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:48.122
        Her stock is up.

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:49.424
         They want her.

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.826
 They don't want you anymore!

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.431
      - You my manager?
      - Of course.

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:57.565
        - You're fired.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.903
 - Come on, Sweeney, 30 years.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:03.104
            Sweeney?

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:05.673
         (banjo music)

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:14.182
      - [Sweeney] Thanks
      for meetin' me.

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:15.883
         - You're late.

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.051
      What do you want?

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:18.953
     - I want to apologize.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.088
            - Okay.

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:25.193
    - Are we gonna finish
    the documentary or what?

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:26.694
          (laughing)

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:29.130
      - I'm sorry, did I
      miss the apology?

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:30.565
         - I'm sorry.

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.533
     Are we gonna finish
     the documentary?

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:33.234
             - No.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.939
      I think we need to
      put that on hold.

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:41.075
  I've got other projects
  that I'm working on, so--

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:43.578
    - Okay, so you're gonna
    walk away for no reason.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.645
         - No reason?

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:46.581
             Right.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.891
          (laughing)

01:14:56.893 --> 01:15:00.962
 - Hey, did you ever see this
 guy sweepin' the streets?

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:04.866
         Real loser.

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:09.871
      (feedback ringing)

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.940
     I know the bit, Frank.

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:14.542
  It just wouldn't come out.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.210
 - I knew a guy in Cleveland.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:18.045
     Always forgot his act.

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:19.647
- I didn't forget my act, Frank.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.148
  It just wouldn't come out.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.551
     Something prevented
     it from coming out.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:25.953
I didn't forget the bit, Frank.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:28.589
         (string music)

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:33.127
     - [Fitzy] 30 years of
     comedy down the drain.

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:34.829
    - [Mary Ellen] What are
    ya gonna do, Sweeney?

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.798
     You gotta do
     somethin', but what?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.567
      - [Fitzy] There's
      nothing he can do.

01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:40.801
          It's over!

01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:42.236
    - [Jimmy] He can sweep.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:46.841
    Come on, Sweeney, get up
    and sweep, sweep, sweep.

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:47.742
             Sweep!

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:52.046
     - I gotta kill 'em.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.550
     (heavy rhythmic music)

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:10.231
    Die, you piece of shit!

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.966
          (thudding)

01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:14.635
  - [Jimmy] You gotta wake
  up pretty late to fool me,

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:17.305
  expecially on a Wednesday.

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.573
      - Where did he go?

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:21.576
 ¶ There is a big (mumbling) ¶

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:22.577
      (change jingling)

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.045
    - [Mary Ellen] Quarters!

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.746
 I need quarters for the bridge
 and for the tonic machine.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.847
          Quarters.

01:16:26.849 --> 01:16:27.748
          Quarters.

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:30.885
     I'm talkin' to you,
     you piece of shit.

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:33.321
     I'll rip that wallet
     right outta your pants

01:16:33.323 --> 01:16:34.288
         with my teeth.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.123
            Come on!

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.460
            Come on!

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.061
Is that it, you stingy bastard?

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:42.897
          ¶ Oh my ¶

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:45.333
      (change jingling)

01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:46.634
    - [Mary Ellen] Quarters!

01:16:46.636 --> 01:16:47.735
         ¶ Hold me to ¶

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.937
    - [Mary Ellen] Sweeney?

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:52.940
 I will take that belt, I will
 wrap it around your balls,

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:55.643
  and I will tear them off
  of your body and stick 'em

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:56.944
         in your ear!

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.779
  Oh, you don't believe me?

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.349
        ¶ Help me move ¶

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.686
 - It's a good thing you
 didn't kill your characters.

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:07.755
     You don't know what
     coulda happened.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.657
  - Frank, this is not good.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:12.093
  My life is out of control.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.928
 - Then get it back in control.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.296
     - I'm tryin' to--
     - But, I don't think

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.131
 you should be killin' anybody.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.634
  Speakin' of kill, did I
  tell about this gig I did

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.068
 in Kingston the other night.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.370
      I fuckin' killed.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:23.871
          (exhaling)

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.339
     And I ordered a latte.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.407
         - All right!

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:29.243
  Ladies and gentlemen, this
  next comedian is going

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:32.647
     to be filming her
     own comedy special.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:34.715
     So without any further
     adieu, give it up

01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:38.953
    for the very funny, the
    very sexy Heather Chase!

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:41.255
          (cheering)

01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:45.159
         (whistling)

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.327
  - Wow, what a great crowd!

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:47.662
          Thank you.

01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:48.996
     It's great to be here.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.831
     Yeah, so I'm getting
     a network special.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.767
          (cheering)
          (clapping)

01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:55.169
     Thank you, thank you.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.171
     It's really exciting,
     and I didn't even have

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.139
  to blow anyone to get it.

01:17:58.141 --> 01:17:59.306
          (laughing)

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:00.408
      But I did anyway.

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:02.009
          (laughing)

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.077
 I'm superstitious like that.

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:05.413
          (laughing)

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:09.216
- So, this is your new project?

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.085
        Filming Heather?

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.420
         - I'm working.

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:14.255
 - Look, I said I was sorry.

01:18:14.257 --> 01:18:15.456
What else do you want me to say?

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.692
    - Well, for starters,
    how 'bout not blaming me

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:18.926
      for your failures.

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:20.161
     - I'm not blaming...

01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:22.463
          (laughing)

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:26.434
             Gene!

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:32.440
     Gene, I am so glad
     you are still here.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:34.742
         - I gotta go.

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:37.044
 I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:43.384
     - Gene, Gene, Gene?

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:44.819
         Gene, listen.

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:45.886
            Gene?
            - What?

01:18:47.457 --> 01:18:49.423
     - I apologize for the
     set the other night,

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:50.458
      for the audition.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.926
     It was an off night.

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:52.760
          (exhaling)

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:53.394
     Give me another shot.

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:54.795
     Let me do another set.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:55.463
     - [Gene] You already
     had your chance.

01:18:55.465 --> 01:18:56.764
         I gotta pee.

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:58.199
        Leave me alone!

01:18:58.201 --> 01:18:59.867
  - Gene, I have been
  waiting 30 years for this!

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:01.435
  - [Gene] I've been
  waitin' 10 minutes to pee!

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:02.770
     Get out of my face!

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:04.021
  - Gene, just five minutes!

01:19:04.022 --> 01:19:05.271
      Just give me a
      set, five minutes?

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:06.507
     - [Gene] Oh, my
     god, leave me alone!

01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:08.876
      - Oh, it was them!

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:10.211
        They ruined it!

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.513
        They ruined it!

01:19:12.515 --> 01:19:14.048
     - [Gene] Oh, my god!

01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:15.216
    What is wrong with you?

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.784
 Will you get outta my face?

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:17.985
 God, I hate this fucking job.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.453
          (cheering)

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:20.387
     - Thank you so much.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:21.522
  You've been a great crowd.

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:23.157
         (whistling)

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:24.258
          Thank you.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.159
          Thank you.

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:28.462
        - I gotta talk.

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:30.331
         I don't know.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:33.234
 Did I bring this on myself?

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:36.170
Did I sabotage my own audition?

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:37.138
         Am I crazy?

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:40.307
  - I have a test for crazy.

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:42.543
      Stay with me here.

01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:44.945
    It's the end of your
    life and God is standing

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.514
        in front of you.

01:19:46.516 --> 01:19:48.115
         Little guy.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.352
    And he says, "Sweeney,
    you've had a good life.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:56.090
 "Now you can either come with
 me and live in eternal bliss

01:19:56.092 --> 01:19:58.559
    "or you can live your
    life over again knowing

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:01.162
     "what you now know."

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:02.463
    Which would you choose?

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:03.998
      - Oh, I'd live my
      life over again.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.567
    - You are fucking crazy.

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:08.135
 - I can't live with the idea

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.405
    of my characters
    runnin' loose out there.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:13.124
        - Well, exactly.

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:14.842
  The longer your
  characters are out there,

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:17.478
      the less you will
      come to matter.

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:20.014
             - Huh.

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:21.315
             What?

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.117
        - So I've heard.

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:24.518
        - Wait a minute.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.042
         You did this!

01:20:31.043 --> 01:20:32.593
    Somehow, you made my
    characters come to life.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.929
    - Sweeney, come on, me?

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.530
     Okay, you're right.

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:37.498
          I did it.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.267
     - Now, it makes sense.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:42.603
  You're the one who told
  me to drop the characters

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:44.371
         from my act.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:45.873
     - I never said that.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:47.975
  All I said was you needed
  to challenge yourself.

01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:49.376
      - How'd you do it?

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:50.611
     - I can't explain it.

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:52.847
     Let's just say, in
     the world of animation

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:55.349
 you can pick up a few tricks.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:59.186
    You needed a challenge,
    I provided one.

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.888
         - Okay, fine.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:05.092
 You made them come to life,
 now you get rid of them.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.429
     - I'm afraid it
     doesn't work that way.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:11.899
     Actually, Sweeney,
     I'm lying about that.

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:13.200
        I'm not afraid.

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:16.136
      - Okay, what am
      I supposed to do?

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:20.107
  I lost the comedy special,
  I pushed my friends away

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:22.309
     and there's a bunch a
     mes out there tryin'

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:23.978
        to ruin my life.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.179
     - Let me ask you
     something, Sweeney.

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:26.947
What is it that makes you happy?

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:28.048
             - Ugh!

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.483
      Not this, not now!

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:30.384
             Happy.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.654
    - Well, the trick is to
    let life be the journey.

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:37.157
     But let happiness,
     and this is important,

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:40.661
 let happiness be your shoes.

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.497
     - Oh, that is good.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:45.532
 What the hell does it mean?

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:46.934
      - I have no idea.

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:48.202
     I read it on a
     fortune cookie once.

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:51.972
         ¶ Look at me ¶

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:54.675
         ¶ All alone ¶

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:59.914
     ¶ I'm just tryin' to
     see where I belong ¶

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:03.117
        ¶ It's just me ¶

01:22:03.119 --> 01:22:06.520
     ¶ Here in my skin ¶

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:11.592
     ¶ And I'm waitin' for
     the world to begin ¶

01:22:12.695 --> 01:22:15.396
    ¶ And that's just fine ¶

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:18.933
      ¶ I'm just tryin'
      to figure out ¶

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.968
        ¶ Is this why ¶

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:24.071
     - The Character King,
     by Justin Schlob.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:26.674
      Justin's homework.

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:28.676
            Schlob.

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:31.578
    What a shitty last name.

01:22:32.682 --> 01:22:35.683
    Sweeney, blah blah blah,
    30 years of comedy.

01:22:35.685 --> 01:22:37.418
     Should be admired
     for his perseverance,

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.119
     envied for his
     talents and admonished

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.955
     for his insecurities.

01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:42.990
             Huh.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:46.126
 He wears his celebrity
 status like a suit of armor.

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.962
     Nearly impenetrable.

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:50.464
 Scratched and scarred with
 mementos of where he's been

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:54.969
     and reminders of where
     he still wants to go.

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.036
             Huh.

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:01.675
     On stage, Sweeney is
     a long head at home,

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:03.694
     ready to do battle.

01:23:03.695 --> 01:23:05.712
 The conquistador, hmm, in
 the center of the spotlight,

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:09.016
 hurling jokes like canon fire
 as he slays another crowd,

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:11.986
     another night, another
     show, another triumph

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:14.688
     in the monarch of
     the Character King.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:17.458
          (laughing)

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.625
         Conquistador.

01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:22.296
          (laughing)

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.665
  Justin, your little shit,
  you're a good writer.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:26.300
          (laughing)

01:23:26.302 --> 01:23:27.501
             Wow.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:28.602
            Not bad.

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:29.737
        (intense music)

01:23:29.739 --> 01:23:31.705
    - Were you gonna litter?

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:33.007
        - Give me that!

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:34.775
         What the fuck?

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:36.744
          (thudding)
          (groaning)

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:39.313
 What are you guys doin' to me?

01:23:39.315 --> 01:23:41.181
     - You got nothin' to
     live for, Sweeney.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:44.218
    - Get away from me, you
    crazy fuckin' creatures!

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.319
          Get away!

01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:47.221
  Get the fuck away from me!

01:23:47.223 --> 01:23:50.024
    You fuckin' crazy fucks!

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:51.492
          Get away!

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:53.060
- Don't push him over so quick!

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:54.661
      I wanna get in a
      few more touches.

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:56.463
  - This make you feel good?

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:57.698
  You want it, then take it.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.466
          (groaning)

01:23:59.468 --> 01:24:00.567
          (laughing)

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:02.069
        Enjoy, Sweeney.

01:24:09.612 --> 01:24:12.446
          (sweeping)

01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:15.516
     (slow string music)

01:24:19.822 --> 01:24:20.788
         - Oh, life.

01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:23.824
             Life!

01:24:25.428 --> 01:24:26.326
             Ugh.

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:29.830
             Life.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.299
             Life.

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:36.837
             Life.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:45.145
             Life.

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:47.448
             Life.

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:48.348
             Life.

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:52.086
             Life.

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:57.658
 I know what makes me happy!

01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:00.127
            Killing!

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:02.129
 - You're not talkin' about me?

01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:02.830
             - No!

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.199
            Killing!

01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:06.333
          On stage!

01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:08.235
     Comedy makes me happy!

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:11.438
     Being the Character
     King makes me happy!

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.509
  Impressin' some high
  school kid makes me happy!

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:17.845
    My life makes me happy!

01:25:17.847 --> 01:25:19.780
  - You see for me, it's
  that second cup of coffee.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:21.482
         - I gotta go.

01:25:21.484 --> 01:25:24.151
I know exactly what I gotta do.

01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:27.221
             Jimmy?

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.657
     James Monroe Yannel?

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:33.894
     I wanna talk to you.

01:25:33.896 --> 01:25:35.312
         I was wrong.

01:25:35.313 --> 01:25:36.729
     I shouldn't a kicked
     you outta my act.

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:40.300
    If I go to Hollywood,
    it'll be with you guys!

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:46.673
          (sweeping)

01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:49.743
     - You missed a spot.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.145
      You don't know
      what you're doin'.

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:52.713
 You don't know how to sweep.

01:25:52.715 --> 01:25:55.482
 - Jimmy, I always liked you.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.719
     You were the first
     alcoholic I ever did.

01:25:58.721 --> 01:26:00.420
         Jimmy, listen.

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:03.857
     How would you like to
     get laid in my act?

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:05.626
            - Laid?

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:08.362
            Really?

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:11.598
  - Jimmy Yannel on a date.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.301
- Not on a Monday or a Tuesday.

01:26:14.303 --> 01:26:16.870
 - You're gonna be a funny bit.

01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:24.945
         (chime music)

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:31.418
     Hey, sorry for the
     whole school thing.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.386
         - Whatever.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:34.721
  - So, what are you doin'?

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:36.557
     You got another
     project you're doin'?

01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:38.458
     - I had to find a new
     comic to write about.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.227
             - Hmm.

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:41.595
            Heather?

01:26:41.597 --> 01:26:42.496
          - No, her.

01:26:43.499 --> 01:26:45.432
        (thudding)
        (plodding music)

01:26:45.434 --> 01:26:46.900
        - Beat it, perv.

01:26:46.902 --> 01:26:49.503
     - No wait, Mary Ellen,
     I wanna talk to ya.

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:51.638
 - I got nothin' to say to you.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.906
      - I want you back.

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:54.808
Come on, Mary Ellen, I need ya.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:56.944
     - Forget it, Sweeney.

01:26:56.946 --> 01:26:58.662
         - Okay, fine.

01:26:58.663 --> 01:27:00.379
 Have you met the new woman in
 my act, Margaret O'Sullivan?

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:03.350
 Oh, my god, Sweeney was right.

01:27:03.352 --> 01:27:04.751
        You are a whore.

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:08.455
     - Who are you callin'
     a tramp, you tramp?

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:11.692
          (thudding)
          (groaning)

01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:12.693
     - [Sweeney] Another.

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:13.627
  - Why should I trust you?

01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:15.596
  - Because I gave you life.

01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:17.397
     Come back to the act.

01:27:18.434 --> 01:27:21.802
    - Well, if you're gonna
    be a beggar, yeah.

01:27:22.605 --> 01:27:24.238
             Yeah.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.639
             Yeah.

01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:27.874
         (chime music)

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:28.942
      - Where'd she go?

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:30.010
        What did you do?

01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:31.712
- She's back where she belongs.

01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:33.214
         - Oh great.

01:27:33.215 --> 01:27:34.715
  Now I have to find someone
  else to write about.

01:27:34.717 --> 01:27:35.549
    - Don't worry about it.

01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:36.416
     You'll find someone.

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:37.784
     - Shut up, Sweeney.

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:39.019
         My dad's here.

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:44.758
- Oh, god, my dogs are barkin'.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:46.760
         Hey Justin?

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.930
Come on, I wanna meet your dad.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:51.665
        (mower growling)

01:27:51.667 --> 01:27:52.933
  - You gotta wear the suit.

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:54.635
    You are Heather are
    like Mr. And Mrs. Leaf.

01:27:54.637 --> 01:27:56.270
            - Right.

01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:58.839
      How would you like
      to snap my twig?

01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:00.007
     - Let's just do this.

01:28:00.009 --> 01:28:02.009
    I got a flight to catch.

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:05.646
         (rock music)

01:28:07.483 --> 01:28:08.382
            - Fitzy?

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:12.586
     Me and you gotta talk.

01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:16.323
      - Come on, Fitzy!

01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:17.057
 We don't got time for this!

01:28:17.059 --> 01:28:18.959
 - It'll only take a second.

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.560
     - I know why you're
     here, Sweeney.

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:22.029
 You wanna get rid of me,
 but you don't have the balls

01:28:22.031 --> 01:28:23.330
          to do it.

01:28:26.402 --> 01:28:28.302
     That's what I thought.

01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:31.405
 - [Heather] Come on, Fitzy.

01:28:31.407 --> 01:28:32.839
     - Hold your horses.

01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:34.041
         - Fitzy, wait.

01:28:34.043 --> 01:28:35.976
          (thudding)
          (groaning)

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:38.078
     - You son of a bitch.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.414
          (groaning)

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:49.823
    - I don't want that
    shit in my documentary.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:56.663
         - Wait, wait!

01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:00.184
             Fitzy!

01:29:00.185 --> 01:29:01.735
I didn't come here to kill you.

01:29:01.737 --> 01:29:04.371
 I came here to bring you home.

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:06.406
    If keepin' you out of
    my act means I won't go

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:09.009
 to Hollywood then so be it.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:10.377
        I love ya, man.

01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:11.078
            Come on.

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:14.348
     This makes me happy.

01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:17.117
          (thudding)
          (groaning)

01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:19.019
     - That makes me happy.

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:21.588
    See ya around, Sweeney.

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:24.358
         (chime music)

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.827
- Jesus, Sweeney, you all right?

01:29:26.829 --> 01:29:27.894
         - Terrific.

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:30.063
 Hey, I'm sorry I fired you.

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:31.631
 - Oh, don't worry about it.

01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:32.799
     - I do worry about it.

01:29:32.801 --> 01:29:34.401
     You're a good friend.

01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:36.370
     Hey, take this number.

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:37.904
     This is a guy
     lookin' for a condo.

01:29:37.906 --> 01:29:39.039
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:40.507
      - Thanks.
      - You're welcome.

01:29:40.509 --> 01:29:41.408
             - Hey!

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:45.746
     Hey, can I get a
     little help up here?

01:29:47.416 --> 01:29:48.382
         - You okay?

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.684
         - Yeah, oh.

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:52.152
        Hey, I'm sorry.

01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:53.086
            - Yeah.

01:29:53.088 --> 01:29:54.154
          - No, no.

01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:55.155
         No excuses.

01:29:55.157 --> 01:29:56.490
         I am sorry.

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.657
         (screaming)

01:29:57.659 --> 01:29:59.059
            Oh!
            - Jesus!

01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:02.162
         (screaming)

01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:03.397
         (clattering)

01:30:03.399 --> 01:30:04.097
            - Whoa!

01:30:05.434 --> 01:30:08.402
          (chatting)

01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:10.137
     - This whole thing,
     unbelievable.

01:30:10.139 --> 01:30:11.805
     - Yeah, really
     unbelievable, right?

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:13.140
             Gees.

01:30:13.142 --> 01:30:14.841
 I wonder if Heather's okay?

01:30:14.843 --> 01:30:16.176
 - That was a bad-lookin' fall.

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:17.544
         - Oh, my god.

01:30:17.546 --> 01:30:18.712
         Oh yeah, no.

01:30:18.714 --> 01:30:19.780
      No, that's great.

01:30:19.782 --> 01:30:20.947
         Okay, thanks.

01:30:20.949 --> 01:30:23.116
          Holy shit!
          - What?

01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:24.551
      - I made the sale!
      - Wow!

01:30:24.553 --> 01:30:26.119
     - [George] Your ex is
     gonna take that condo.

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:27.454
          - No way!

01:30:27.456 --> 01:30:28.855
         Oh, my god.

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:30.457
      He wanted to be
      closer to Justin.

01:30:30.459 --> 01:30:31.758
     - This is so great.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.859
        Thanks, Sweeney.

01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:34.461
             - Ah.

01:30:34.463 --> 01:30:37.731
     - Yeah, no, I gotta
     go make money.

01:30:37.733 --> 01:30:38.799
         - All right.

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:42.936
          (laughing)

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:46.039
    - That was really nice.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.141
- Well he deserved it after
everything I've put him through.

01:30:50.813 --> 01:30:52.179
     I guess I gotta go.

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:53.847
         See ya around.

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:54.714
            - Wait.

01:30:55.884 --> 01:30:59.019
     Are we gonna finish
     this movie, or what?

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:02.589
             - Oh.

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.766
 - Thanks for comin', Sweeney.

01:31:12.768 --> 01:31:15.469
      - Oh, no problem,
      I owed it to you.

01:31:15.471 --> 01:31:16.470
     - I'll tell me
     teacher you're here.

01:31:16.472 --> 01:31:18.605
  This is gonna be awesome.

01:31:18.607 --> 01:31:20.106
         - Hey, Justin.

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:21.942
     - Oh, hey Laura, hey.

01:31:23.145 --> 01:31:24.678
 - I'm really lookin' forward
 to your guest speaker today.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.246
      - Yeah, cool cool.

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:28.548
     - See you in class?

01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:30.951
 - Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:33.186
             Bye.

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:34.955
          (laughing)

01:31:34.957 --> 01:31:37.057
      - See ya in class.

01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:38.859
     - I'll see you inside.

01:31:38.861 --> 01:31:41.194
     - I love you, sweetie.

01:31:41.196 --> 01:31:43.563
         - Good kid.
         - Yeah, he is.

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.269
So speaking of kids Sweeney,
what are you gonna say to them?

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:53.974
             - Wow.

01:31:56.078 --> 01:31:57.811
  Here's what I'm gonna say.

01:31:57.813 --> 01:32:02.249
  After all the sacrifices,
  victories, the defeats,

01:32:02.251 --> 01:32:04.651
  one day you're gonna wake
  up, you're gonna look

01:32:04.653 --> 01:32:06.853
    in the mirror and you're
    gonna say, "Am I happy?

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:08.588
     "Am I really happy?"

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:13.226
    My mother used to say if
    you find a job you love,

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:17.197
you'll never work a day in your
life, and she lived by that.

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:19.199
     She got fired from
     every job she ever had

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.967
 'cause she never showed up.

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:23.420
         Not my point.

01:32:23.421 --> 01:32:25.872
 The point is talent without
 hard work is nothing.

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:29.142
    Talent without hard work
    is like you're wearin'

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:31.811
     a beautiful suit, but
     you have skid marks

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:33.213
     on your underwears.

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.849
     Talent is like a seed.

01:32:35.851 --> 01:32:38.118
      You have to water
      it with hard work.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.252
  So what are you gonna do?

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:40.554
Are you gonna do the hard work?

01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:42.088
     Are you gonna change
     those underwears?

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:44.991
  So when you look in the
  mirror, don't ask yourself

01:32:44.993 --> 01:32:46.326
  how much money did I make.

01:32:46.328 --> 01:32:49.329
    Ask yourself how much of
    a difference did I make.

01:32:49.331 --> 01:32:51.565
      Don't ask yourself
      how rich you are.

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:53.867
      Ask yourself how
      much did I share.

01:32:53.869 --> 01:32:56.903
  Don't ask yourself how
  much more is there to do.

01:32:56.905 --> 01:33:00.106
Ask yourself what more can I do?

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:02.242
      (triumphant music)

01:33:02.244 --> 01:33:05.278
 Then, when you look in the
 mirror, you are not gonna have

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:08.648
to ask yourself if you're happy

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:11.985
     because you'll already
     know the answer.

01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:16.590
     - That was beautiful.

01:33:17.726 --> 01:33:19.159
    - Well, it's everything
    I ever learned from life

01:33:19.161 --> 01:33:21.661
 and freakin' fortune cookies.

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:24.598
          (laughing)

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.599
          Shall we?

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:27.067
      - Yes, definitely.

01:33:27.069 --> 01:33:28.001
        (tires skidding)

01:33:28.003 --> 01:33:28.868
          - Sweeney!

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:30.136
         They want you!

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:31.871
         They want you!

01:33:31.873 --> 01:33:32.973
        - Who wants me?

01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:33.873
            - Gene.

01:33:35.243 --> 01:33:39.012
  Heather broke her leg in
  like six different places.

01:33:39.014 --> 01:33:41.081
      She's gonna be in
      a cast for months.

01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:43.917
     They need someone to
     fly to L.A. right now.

01:33:43.919 --> 01:33:46.086
     - What about my act?

01:33:46.088 --> 01:33:49.322
      - You still can't
      do the characters.

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:51.658
    - Well, even though he
    bombed and beat up Gene?

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:54.928
    - Oh, Gene was hammered
    most of the night.

01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:58.098
Plus, he knows Sweeney's funny.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.399
    Plus, they're desperate.

01:33:59.401 --> 01:34:01.334
     Plus, they need
     somebody right away

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:03.820
      or they're gonna
      get somebody else.

01:34:03.821 --> 01:34:06.305
  Plus, you've been working
  for this your whole life.

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:09.175
- So what's it gonna be Sweeney?

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:11.678
          (sweeping)

01:34:39.441 --> 01:34:41.441
     - See, this is what
     I'm talkin' about.

01:34:41.443 --> 01:34:42.676
         It's a curse.

01:34:42.678 --> 01:34:43.443
            - What?

01:34:43.445 --> 01:34:46.413
  What are ya talkin' about?

01:34:46.415 --> 01:34:47.414
     - It's not a curse.

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:49.416
         It's a choice.

01:34:49.418 --> 01:34:51.384
     It's a choice I made
     a long time ago.

01:34:51.386 --> 01:34:53.219
        I'm glad I did.

01:34:53.221 --> 01:34:55.188
      - But does this
      mean that you're--

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:57.223
        - I'm not goin'!

01:34:57.225 --> 01:34:59.092
     - Have you lost what's
     left of your mind?

01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:00.760
     - You're gonna turn
     down the TV special?

01:35:00.762 --> 01:35:03.129
 - Yeah, and I'm okay with it.

01:35:03.131 --> 01:35:04.397
          I'm happy.

01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:06.766
    This is where I belong.

01:35:06.768 --> 01:35:08.001
            Come on!

01:35:08.003 --> 01:35:10.270
    I don't wanna
    disappoint Justin again.

01:35:10.272 --> 01:35:12.338
  Oh yeah, do you wanna go
  to dinner with me tonight?

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.473
 - Yeah, I'd like that, but I--

01:35:13.475 --> 01:35:15.909
  - Yeah, great great great.

01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:43.770
  It is never too late to be
  what you might have been.

01:35:43.772 --> 01:35:45.371
         George Eliot.

01:35:45.373 --> 01:35:48.108
Oh, real name was Mary Ann
Evans, but that's another story.

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.877
        (intense music)

01:35:50.879 --> 01:35:52.312
            George!

01:35:52.314 --> 01:35:54.114
        Where's the car?

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:55.915
 - But I thought you were happy
 being the Character King?

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:58.852
     - I am, but this is my
     own freakin' special!

01:35:58.854 --> 01:36:00.019
          (laughing)

01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:00.854
            George!

01:36:03.825 --> 01:36:05.058
     Hey, do you wanna
     go to L.A. with me?

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.292
            - Sure.

01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:07.861
         - All right.
         - Yes!

01:36:09.331 --> 01:36:10.230
          - Sweeney?

01:36:11.166 --> 01:36:12.332
         - Oh, shit!

01:36:12.334 --> 01:36:13.333
     - You suck, Sweeney!

01:36:13.335 --> 01:36:16.169
- [Students] You suck, Sweeney!

01:36:16.171 --> 01:36:18.538
          - George!

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.439
            George!

01:36:19.808 --> 01:36:20.507
          - Get him!

01:36:20.509 --> 01:36:25.445

      This is like the
      freakin' marathon!

01:36:54.209 --> 01:36:57.911
     - If I go to L.A., I
     could wear a bikini.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.849
 - If I see you in a
 bikini, I will start pukin'

01:37:02.851 --> 01:37:04.951
     and I will never stop.

01:37:04.953 --> 01:37:06.286
        I shit you not.

01:37:07.088 --> 01:37:08.321
 - I'm not cleanin' that up.

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:09.522
 Not on a Monday or a Tuesday.

01:37:09.524 --> 01:37:13.126

     'cause that'd be okay.

            ¶ Hey ¶
