WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.362
I live in a small town,

00:02.413 --> 00:04.249
and I own an antique shop.

00:04.250 --> 00:06.413
I might be just like you.

00:06.414 --> 00:08.228
Except that from the time I was a little girl,

00:08.229 --> 00:10.469
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:10.643 --> 00:11.976
It's all right, honey.

00:11.977 --> 00:14.655
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them.

00:15.214 --> 00:17.656
They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living

00:17.657 --> 00:19.807
and they come to me for help.

00:23.088 --> 00:25.023
In order to tell you my story,

00:25.024 --> 00:26.867
I have to tell you theirs.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

01:08.687 --> 01:09.577
thank you very much.

01:09.578 --> 01:11.103
We are three days grace.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.920
We'll be right back.

01:14.652 --> 01:16.205
When you said that we were going out dancing,

01:16.206 --> 01:18.073
I didn't think this was what you meant.

01:18.074 --> 01:19.239
I--I said there might be dancing.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.385
Your exact words were,

01:20.386 --> 01:22.542
"I cannot wait to get you out on the dance floor."

01:22.543 --> 01:24.649
Come on. Jumping up and down can be dancing.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.208
Another round, folks?

01:26.209 --> 01:27.104
Yeah, yeah.

01:27.105 --> 01:28.341
2 would be great.

01:28.342 --> 01:29.095
Brandon!

01:29.096 --> 01:30.918
Order up for the band.

01:31.598 --> 01:33.928
Sorry, guys.Give me one sec.

01:35.869 --> 01:37.333
Does that guy look familiar to you?

01:37.334 --> 01:38.192
I don't think so.

01:38.193 --> 01:38.980
You?

01:38.981 --> 01:40.070
I don't know.

01:40.071 --> 01:41.411
Why don't you play, man?

01:45.720 --> 01:46.848
-- You gotta play.
-- no no no

01:46.977 --> 01:50.051
Here, I got a guitar--I got a guitar right here.

01:56.802 --> 01:58.002
Freebird!

02:11.959 --> 02:13.497
He's amazing.

02:14.574 --> 02:15.829
Oh, wait a minute.

02:15.830 --> 02:16.906
That's why I know this guy.

02:16.907 --> 02:18.454
He used to play for crimson doves.

02:18.455 --> 02:19.462
-- Who?
-- Crimson doves.

02:19.463 --> 02:20.585
They were a local band,

02:20.586 --> 02:22.154
uh...big favorite.

02:22.155 --> 02:23.743
They released this great album a few years back,

02:23.744 --> 02:25.754
and then they just kinda disappeared.

02:29.979 --> 02:31.632
Do you feel that?

02:43.941 --> 02:45.148
Ten.

02:47.984 --> 02:49.296
What?What's going on?

03:11.193 --> 03:12.397
Let me guess.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.758
That wasn't the ghost of jimi hendrix?

03:14.948 --> 03:17.972
But it gave new meaning to stage fright.

03:51.328 --> 03:53.436
You know, why does a guy like that work here?

03:53.437 --> 03:56.694
I mean, he should be on the cover of rolling stone,not serving drinks.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.264
Maybe he gets monster tips here.

03:58.265 --> 04:01.557
Or maybe a ghost is trying to stop him from doing what he loves.

04:01.558 --> 04:02.490
I hate that.

04:02.491 --> 04:04.659
You're dead,you can't move on,I get it.

04:04.728 --> 04:06.098
But don't mess with the living,

04:06.099 --> 04:08.100
especially when they're as talented as he is.

04:08.101 --> 04:09.752
I'm gonna get the jeep.

04:09.753 --> 04:11.264
You stay here,you stay warm.

04:11.265 --> 04:13.094
We'll get this ghost into therapy when we get home.

04:13.095 --> 04:14.261
All right.

04:14.265 --> 04:16.512
Oh, hi! Hey,you were great up there.

04:16.514 --> 04:17.899
Oh, thanks.

04:18.273 --> 04:19.933
Aw, I never did get you those drinks,did I?

04:19.934 --> 04:21.475
We cut ourselves off.

04:21.476 --> 04:22.573
I'm melinda.

04:22.574 --> 04:23.603
Oh. Nice to meet you.

04:23.604 --> 04:25.565
It was weird what happened.Were you ok?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.044
Yeah, it's just some feedback problems.

04:27.045 --> 04:28.322
It's happened before.

04:28.323 --> 04:31.506
Oh, really?Like when you used to play with, uh, crimson doves?

04:31.507 --> 04:32.447
Are you a fan?

04:32.448 --> 04:33.616
My husband was.

04:33.617 --> 04:34.846
So he told you about the curse?

04:34.847 --> 04:36.486
No. What curse?

04:36.487 --> 04:37.570
Just a bad urban legend.

04:37.571 --> 04:38.561
Have a good night.

04:38.562 --> 04:40.767
Well, do you have a second to talk?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.657
Come on.You really think you can get $3,000 for this?

04:53.658 --> 04:55.752
Easy. It's rumored that the doors played on it.

04:55.753 --> 04:56.724
Who are the doors?

04:56.725 --> 04:58.472
Oh, ouch.

04:58.473 --> 04:59.415
But how are you gonna sell it?

04:59.416 --> 05:01.800
It's broken.It needs a new one of...those pedals.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.244
Well, I worked with a refurbisher,

05:03.245 --> 05:04.520
and his card's still on file.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.571
He's also looking to buy a condo if someone wants to sell him one.

05:07.572 --> 05:10.438
-- Serendipity,the name is melinda.
-- Thank you.

05:10.439 --> 05:11.593
I will have to check my schedule,

05:11.594 --> 05:13.142
but I think we're free, right?

05:13.143 --> 05:15.643
I have a ton of homework that the dog needs to eat.

05:15.644 --> 05:16.503
Ok, fine.

05:16.504 --> 05:17.921
But I want to see it when you get home.

05:17.922 --> 05:18.979
Ok.

05:20.700 --> 05:21.704
Bye, ned.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.293
Yeah.That's a lot of fun to live with for the past week.

05:25.294 --> 05:27.082
What's going on?

05:27.768 --> 05:29.353
Charlie's birthday is coming up.

05:29.354 --> 05:30.345
I know. Weird.

05:30.346 --> 05:31.307
He's dead.

05:31.308 --> 05:32.555
But...

05:32.556 --> 05:37.219
celebrating his birthday is just a little way for us to keep his spirit with us.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.323
Actually,it makes perfect sense.

05:39.838 --> 05:40.704
Yeah, well...

05:40.705 --> 05:41.818
ned's not so crazy about it.

05:41.819 --> 05:42.770
He knows it's coming up,

05:42.771 --> 05:44.546
and he's doing everything he can to avoid it,

05:44.547 --> 05:47.413
and by extension, avoid me.

05:47.485 --> 05:49.063
Hey, look. I found it.

05:49.064 --> 05:52.146
So I'm gonna be on the hunt for a new pedal.

05:52.610 --> 05:54.342
-- Howdy.
-- Hello, handsome.

05:54.624 --> 05:55.587
Hi, delia.

05:57.977 --> 05:59.963
Lesson jim learned at work today:

05:59.964 --> 06:02.065
Don't get caught surfing myspace at work.

06:02.066 --> 06:05.123
Ooh, is there mocking?

06:05.238 --> 06:07.810
Something along the lines of you being a 13-year-old girl?

06:07.811 --> 06:08.766
Very funny.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.969
It was all worth it because...

06:11.415 --> 06:12.553
a link for the crimson doves.

06:12.554 --> 06:13.821
Oh...

06:14.505 --> 06:15.780
"rest in peace, jared".

06:15.781 --> 06:16.931
Yeah.He's the lead singer.

06:16.932 --> 06:18.908
Get this...he dies in a plane crash

06:18.909 --> 06:21.581
2 days before that cd I was talking about comes out.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.528
But it gets better.

06:22.529 --> 06:24.583
This guy?He's the bass player.His name's sampson.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.844
That's not a stage name.

06:25.845 --> 06:30.021
He gives an interview where he says that the band has not been able to play together since the plane crash,

06:30.022 --> 06:31.712
-- because...
-- they were cursed.

06:31.713 --> 06:32.866
Yup. Bingo.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.066
Maybe that's what brandon was talking about.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.580
Yeah, except it's not the curse.

06:36.581 --> 06:38.663
It's the lead singer's ghost.

06:39.582 --> 06:40.775
Jared.

06:41.365 --> 06:42.975
Is there contact information in here?

06:42.976 --> 06:44.976
No, but  it's a good thing

06:44.977 --> 06:48.521
there aren't too many guys with the first name sampson in our zip code.

06:48.522 --> 06:50.380
This guy writes commercial jingles for the radio.

06:50.381 --> 06:51.410
You rock.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.827
Yes, I do.

06:53.310 --> 06:54.754
I gotta get back to work.

06:55.627 --> 06:56.735
All right...

06:57.493 --> 07:00.589
the first gig we did after jared died should be on here somewhere.

07:03.576 --> 07:04.756
Is that...

07:04.757 --> 07:06.135
is that jared?

07:06.138 --> 07:07.189
Yeah.

07:09.450 --> 07:12.001
They had that telepathy only those weird,creative types have.

07:12.002 --> 07:15.215
Best friends since childhood,too,so that helped.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.949
Where's my head?

07:16.950 --> 07:18.762
This is the wrong dvd.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.361
who is that?

07:26.362 --> 07:28.139
Oh. Sandy, jared's girlfriend.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.234
What are you guys doing?

07:29.235 --> 07:31.981
Brandon has a love song we're trying to get off the ground.

07:31.982 --> 07:32.839
Ooh.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.762
Who's it about,brandon?

07:36.151 --> 07:38.907
You know, let me know when you guys are ready to work.

07:39.869 --> 07:41.868
I guess brandon didn't like her very much.

07:41.869 --> 07:43.011
Not too much.

07:43.039 --> 07:45.053
They competed for jared's attention.

07:46.889 --> 07:49.372
This is a month after the funeral.

07:49.373 --> 07:53.060
With jared gone,brandon tried vocals. But...

07:58.198 --> 07:59.619
Wait, pause it.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.241
Does that look like a "10" to you?

08:07.964 --> 08:09.304
I don't see it.

08:13.573 --> 08:14.466
Let me get this straight.

08:14.467 --> 08:16.606
The crimson--whatever-they-ares,

08:16.607 --> 08:20.060
they can't play music,and now they're blaming it on a curse?

08:20.144 --> 08:21.456
Doves. Yeah.

08:21.457 --> 08:23.020
Anyway, something'snbeen getting in their way,

08:23.021 --> 08:25.599
and I think since the lead singer's ghost died

08:25.600 --> 08:27.559
just about the same time as they stopped being able to play,

08:27.560 --> 08:28.596
it might be related.

08:28.597 --> 08:31.165
You know what fascinates me about pop culture curses?

08:31.166 --> 08:34.628
The delusional weight that the fans attribute to the curse.

08:34.629 --> 08:37.111
Have you heard of the "paul is dead" hoax?

08:37.111 --> 08:39.241
A little.Paul, as in mccartney?

08:39.241 --> 08:40.457
Yeah.Well, in a nutshell,

08:40.458 --> 08:44.017
a bunch of beatlemaniacs turned the volume way up on strawberry fields forever,

08:44.018 --> 08:46.697
and they think they hear "I buried paul."

08:46.698 --> 08:50.591
Next thing you know,rumors pop up that the cute one went toes-up in a car crash.

08:50.592 --> 08:53.201
All right, admit it.You were the beatlemaniac who started that rumor.

08:53.202 --> 08:55.654
Oh, sweetheart. If only.Are you kidding me?

08:55.655 --> 08:56.911
If I started that rumor?

08:56.912 --> 08:58.023
That would have been the best.

08:58.024 --> 08:58.834
But it wasn't me.

08:58.835 --> 09:00.448
It was john lennon's studio trickery.

09:00.449 --> 09:01.523
He said,

09:01.524 --> 09:02.829
"cranberry sauce".

09:02.830 --> 09:04.812
That was it.

09:04.813 --> 09:06.419
Now, you're talking about a physical manifestation,

09:06.420 --> 09:08.985
where people are actually getting ill, playing poorly?

09:08.986 --> 09:13.188
-- Exactly.
-- Well, there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of that.

09:13.189 --> 09:15.589
It's--well, it's called infrasound.

09:15.590 --> 09:17.013
What's that?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.550
Well, infrasound...

09:18.551 --> 09:20.100
is a frequency...

09:20.101 --> 09:22.889
That's not unlike...

09:24.072 --> 09:25.032
Oh!

09:25.415 --> 09:26.304
Please don't do that.

09:26.305 --> 09:28.007
It sounds like nails on a chalkboard.

09:28.008 --> 09:29.737
Like nails on a chalkboard.

09:30.076 --> 09:32.996
See, different frequencies affect different people in different ways.

09:32.997 --> 09:35.271
But infrasound is a frequency so low

09:35.272 --> 09:37.104
that we can't even hear it at all.

09:37.105 --> 09:38.736
But human beings can feel it.

09:38.737 --> 09:40.194
It rattles our bones,it makes us sick.

09:40.195 --> 09:43.552
Now, the wives' tale is that when ghosts want to make their presence felt,

09:43.553 --> 09:45.048
they use that frequency.

09:45.510 --> 09:46.440
Ok, so...

09:46.441 --> 09:48.323
say that the tale is true,

09:48.324 --> 09:51.898
and that the lead singer's ghost pulled a frequency through the amp and speakers,

09:51.899 --> 09:53.295
it could make someone sick, right?

09:53.296 --> 09:54.260
In theory.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.213
Ok, so theoretically,

09:55.214 --> 09:56.963
how do we counteract it?

09:56.964 --> 09:58.364
Uh, well, you have to tune off of it.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.810
Go to the lowest "g" chord available on an electrical instrument.

10:01.811 --> 10:04.672
Uh, that would naturalize the vibrative harmonies

10:04.673 --> 10:07.781
and make the music a little less...stomach-churning.

10:07.827 --> 10:09.974
And what about the number 10?

10:10.054 --> 10:11.556
That's a pretty broad topic.

10:11.557 --> 10:14.030
Does it have any relevance?It keeps popping up.

10:14.215 --> 10:17.267
If it has something to do with your curse,I don't know.I'll look into it.

10:18.549 --> 10:19.576
Hello?

10:19.577 --> 10:20.654
Hi, delia.

10:21.819 --> 10:23.840
How much to fix the piano?

10:25.553 --> 10:26.906
Ok, you know what?Do me a favor

10:26.907 --> 10:29.937
and just find out how much it is for just the parts.

10:29.938 --> 10:33.536
I think I know somebody who can fix the piano for us at a discount.

10:34.991 --> 10:36.934
So how'd you find out I knew about pianos?

10:37.288 --> 10:40.711
I heard that you were classically trained,and I took a wild guess.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.708
Have you been checking up on me?

10:42.709 --> 10:43.544
A little.

10:43.545 --> 10:45.637
When you mentioned a curse,I got curious.

10:46.156 --> 10:47.646
I don't think that's your problem.

10:48.078 --> 10:50.993
Do you always ask personal questions of people you just met?

10:50.994 --> 10:52.711
Actually, yes.

10:53.118 --> 10:54.175
Why do you work in a club?

10:54.176 --> 10:55.693
Because I need a job.

10:56.346 --> 11:00.538
And before you try to get a tearful confession out of me
about how much I wish I could be up there,

11:00.539 --> 11:02.539
let me just save you the trouble.

11:02.540 --> 11:05.037
I wake up every morning wanting that.

11:05.038 --> 11:06.300
But I can'T.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.353
And there's nothing I can do about it.

11:10.549 --> 11:11.876
Brandon, I--

11:12.777 --> 11:15.463
I know a little about having a gift

11:15.464 --> 11:17.581
and being frustrated by it.

11:18.102 --> 11:19.413
I think I can help you.

11:19.414 --> 11:20.521
You don't even know me.

11:20.522 --> 11:23.994
You're right.But all I'm asking you to do is play one song.

11:24.385 --> 11:27.250
If anything happens to this piano,I'm not responsible.

11:27.422 --> 11:28.892
Agreed.

11:46.428 --> 11:47.881
Keep playing.

11:48.413 --> 11:50.760
But when I tell you, hit the low "g", ok?

11:50.761 --> 11:51.648
Why?

11:51.649 --> 11:53.262
Just trust me.

12:01.537 --> 12:02.351
Make him play it.

12:02.352 --> 12:03.487
Play what?

12:03.488 --> 12:05.942
-- What?
-- Play the tenth.

12:21.945 --> 12:23.890
You know, I know that this is gonna sound random,

12:23.891 --> 12:26.045
but have you ever played the tenth?

12:27.597 --> 12:29.119
You don't know what that is.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.555
Nope.

12:31.679 --> 12:33.191
what about music teachers?

12:33.192 --> 12:36.165
Did any of them ever ask you to play the tenth?

12:36.688 --> 12:39.070
I had one music teacher my whole life.

12:39.071 --> 12:40.858
Quite accomplished,actually.

12:40.859 --> 12:42.722
He played piano for the new york philharmonic.

12:42.723 --> 12:44.938
Wrote some symphonies for them, too.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.467
And he's buried right next to my mom.

12:47.656 --> 12:48.799
It's your dad.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.125
Yeah.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.732
And the tenth never came up.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.226
-- here you are.
-- Thank you.

13:23.826 --> 13:24.871
Excuse me.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.061
Crazy question.

13:26.062 --> 13:29.114
You have patrick roth's other 9 symphonies here.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.641
Do you know anything about a tenth?

13:30.642 --> 13:32.287
Uh, let me check.

13:34.088 --> 13:37.774
Oh, it says here he passed away before he could complete it.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.355
Although, we do have his first 3 movements on file.

13:40.356 --> 13:42.252
I see. Could I get a copy of that score?

13:42.253 --> 13:44.983
Sure. We also have recordings of his symphony rehearsals.

13:44.984 --> 13:46.258
Can I hear them?

14:07.996 --> 14:09.829
He must play it!

14:10.503 --> 14:12.306
Is that what you want?

14:12.372 --> 14:13.759
Brandon to play this?

14:13.869 --> 14:15.116
No!

14:15.117 --> 14:17.130
You're not getting it!

14:28.282 --> 14:30.062
Classical music.

14:30.063 --> 14:31.345
Yeah. I just found out myself.

14:31.346 --> 14:33.423
I know that it revolves around the tenth.

14:33.424 --> 14:35.835
Um, but it's more like play the tenth symphony,

14:35.836 --> 14:37.571
and the one that I found wasn't even finished.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.090
No, no.I can make this work.

14:39.091 --> 14:39.819
This I can make work.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.130
Sure, I would have loved having this information

14:42.131 --> 14:45.745
before I promised sexual favors to a very unappealing woman at the rock and roll hall of fame,

14:45.746 --> 14:48.767
but maybe your problem is actually your solution.

14:48.768 --> 14:49.970
The curse of the ninth?

14:49.971 --> 14:53.363
All the great composers died after completing their ninth symphony.

14:53.364 --> 14:56.621
I--you're talking beethoven, mahler,bruckner.

14:56.622 --> 14:58.137
They all croaked halfway through their tenth.

14:58.138 --> 14:59.161
Is this curse real?

14:59.162 --> 15:01.122
No. No, no. It's not a real curse at all.

15:01.123 --> 15:03.788
These guys all died from having their brains rotted from venereal disease,

15:03.789 --> 15:07.415
but saying it's a curse makes it sound more respectable.

15:07.416 --> 15:09.731
And what about a ghost coming back to finish his work?

15:09.732 --> 15:11.406
Is there anything in here about that?

15:11.407 --> 15:14.607
Well, it's rumored that brahms was so haunted by beethoven's ghost

15:14.608 --> 15:16.643
he couldn't write a word for 20 years.

15:16.644 --> 15:18.422
That is brilliant.Thank you.

15:18.423 --> 15:19.498
Wait. Wait.

15:19.606 --> 15:22.680
Hey, before you leave a melinda-shaped hole in that wall,

15:22.681 --> 15:24.931
you said there were doves in your symbolism?

15:24.932 --> 15:26.868
Crimson doves.That was the name of the band.

15:26.869 --> 15:28.118
Listen to this.

15:28.825 --> 15:30.074
"The death of a dove,

15:30.075 --> 15:31.134
symbolically speaking,

15:31.135 --> 15:32.207
"indicates misfortune.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.545
"And the death of a dove near someone's house

15:34.546 --> 15:37.336
"means the impending death of someone in that house."

15:37.337 --> 15:39.094
Maybe this lead singer's death,

15:39.095 --> 15:41.611
isn't just a coincidence.

15:41.938 --> 15:44.640
Yeah. Maybe.

15:45.860 --> 15:46.725
I can see the dead,

15:46.726 --> 15:48.939
and your father's ghost is attached to you.

15:49.197 --> 15:50.904
So is this the part where you say,

15:50.905 --> 15:52.580
"I'm getting a "p" name."

15:52.581 --> 15:53.647
And I say, "patrick."

15:53.648 --> 15:56.771
And you say,"he wants you to stop worrying about money."

15:56.772 --> 15:57.503
And I say--

15:57.504 --> 15:59.540
your father is 3 inches shorter than you.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.741
His hairline is receding.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.390
He has a soft european accent. German, I think.

16:03.391 --> 16:04.494
Seems like an impatient guy,

16:04.495 --> 16:07.186
and the last time I was with him,he kept telling me how I wasn't getting it.

16:07.187 --> 16:09.049
How am I doing?

16:09.971 --> 16:12.006
He used to say that to me all the time.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.730
When I would practice.

16:15.731 --> 16:17.421
4 hours a day.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.148
Every day.

16:19.907 --> 16:21.927
He made me play his symphonies.

16:23.002 --> 16:25.569
You're not getting it,brandon.

16:25.570 --> 16:26.909
You're off the beat.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.894
Your orchestra is lapping you.

16:28.895 --> 16:30.170
Don't look down.

16:30.171 --> 16:31.584
The answer isn't in your hands,

16:31.585 --> 16:32.603
it's here.

16:32.854 --> 16:34.067
Play it right.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.228
Or don't play at all.

16:38.325 --> 16:41.103
Ghosts stay behind because they have unfinished business with the living.

16:41.104 --> 16:43.673
I think your father trying to ruin your music...

16:44.137 --> 16:46.392
is because he wants you to finish this.

16:49.271 --> 16:51.640
Do you have any idea what you're asking me to do here?

16:51.641 --> 16:53.283
The man made my life miserable.

16:53.284 --> 16:55.468
And now you want me to get inside of his head?

16:55.469 --> 16:57.328
Look, I understand.But if you complete the symphony,

16:57.329 --> 16:59.034
I can cross him over.

16:59.581 --> 17:00.599
Wh--what does that mean?

17:00.600 --> 17:02.968
It means you can play music again.

17:02.969 --> 17:04.814
Your music.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.461
Hey, have you seen the calculator?

17:16.851 --> 17:20.330
Have you thought about what you want to do for your dad's birthday tomorrow?

17:20.692 --> 17:21.965
How about nothing?

17:21.967 --> 17:23.771
Ned, look at me.

17:24.013 --> 17:25.017
This is important.

17:25.018 --> 17:26.406
I really want to do it.

17:26.407 --> 17:28.262
Whatever. That's fine.

17:30.031 --> 17:31.143
Hey!

17:31.144 --> 17:32.074
Hey!

17:32.075 --> 17:33.782
That electric piano is the hit of the town.

17:33.783 --> 17:35.155
I've already had 3 bids on it.

17:35.156 --> 17:37.147
Uh, well, you have him to thank for fixing it.

17:37.148 --> 17:38.008
Brandon, delia.

17:38.009 --> 17:39.622
Delia, brandon.

17:42.065 --> 17:43.219
He's very artistic.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.485
As long as he brings traffic through the store,

17:44.486 --> 17:47.061
he can be as artistic as he wants.

17:47.062 --> 17:48.063
Come on.

17:49.214 --> 17:51.228
Hi, ned.

17:56.445 --> 17:58.733
I have a pretty good sense of my dad's composing style,

17:58.734 --> 18:00.292
but I'm gonna have to play it through once

18:00.293 --> 18:02.735
just to get a feel for what he was trying to say.

18:02.736 --> 18:04.330
Is there anything I can help you with?

18:04.592 --> 18:05.327
Yeah. Uh,

18:05.328 --> 18:07.239
do you have a tape recorder?

18:09.233 --> 18:12.183
You never answered my question about tomorrow night.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.690
Do you remember the creme brulee that you and dad always liked?

18:17.691 --> 18:19.195
Maybe I could make that.

18:19.196 --> 18:21.084
Or maybe we shouldn't do anything.

18:21.085 --> 18:22.277
How come?

18:22.712 --> 18:25.433
Because it's been 3 years.

18:25.655 --> 18:27.433
Because it--

18:27.434 --> 18:28.558
ned.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.796
I want to talk about this.

18:33.149 --> 18:35.289
I have a report due on to kill a mockingbird.

18:35.303 --> 18:37.178
I, um--left it in the back room.

18:37.179 --> 18:38.587
I'll be right back.

18:41.361 --> 18:42.307
How's this?

18:42.308 --> 18:43.976
Oh, it's perfect.

18:46.521 --> 18:47.981
You can do this.

18:48.757 --> 18:50.302
Last time I missed a note,

18:50.303 --> 18:52.100
my dad almost drew blood.

18:52.773 --> 18:54.775
Now that he's a ghost,

18:54.991 --> 18:56.700
who knows what he'll do?

18:56.740 --> 18:59.379
Sometimes,ghosts have messages for the living.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.462
I might need your help to understand it.

19:01.463 --> 19:03.128
A word, a phrase.

19:03.129 --> 19:05.749
Something that might have meaning for the two of you.

19:23.424 --> 19:25.233
Brandon,your dad's here.

19:26.282 --> 19:27.677
I didn't hit the low "g".

19:27.728 --> 19:29.098
No, it's ok.

19:29.270 --> 19:32.299
It's ok.He probably just needed to see you play.

19:36.741 --> 19:37.946
What is that?

19:45.373 --> 19:46.896
I think we're ok.

19:46.897 --> 19:48.443
Help me.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.767
Hit the low "g".

20:01.602 --> 20:03.021
Jared.

20:05.636 --> 20:07.011
Wait, wait, wait.

20:07.012 --> 20:08.664
Are you trying to tell me that...

20:08.665 --> 20:10.296
my dad is gone,

20:10.297 --> 20:11.803
and there's another ghost?

20:11.804 --> 20:13.217
Yeah, attached to him.

20:13.218 --> 20:14.483
Uh, it's jared.

20:14.484 --> 20:15.870
He's in the store.

20:15.871 --> 20:17.054
How's it goin', buddy?

20:17.055 --> 20:18.689
He says hi.

20:19.869 --> 20:21.230
That's--

20:21.726 --> 20:24.608
my god,that's awesome.

20:24.764 --> 20:26.773
Yeah. Why are you here?

20:26.774 --> 20:28.142
To protect brandon.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.182
He's protecting you.

20:29.183 --> 20:29.898
From who?

20:29.899 --> 20:32.663
From that waste of time.

20:32.664 --> 20:33.504
Waste of time?

20:33.505 --> 20:34.577
What are you talking about?

20:34.578 --> 20:35.616
I know.

20:38.599 --> 20:41.409
We'd been playing together for about a year.

20:52.691 --> 20:54.457
What did you guys think?

20:54.458 --> 20:55.436
I really don't think it works.

20:55.437 --> 20:57.205
It was beautiful.

20:57.764 --> 20:59.525
Do you have lyrics?

21:01.161 --> 21:03.183
I'm still working on them.

21:03.184 --> 21:04.956
And you guys want something to eat,

21:04.957 --> 21:06.853
or drink, or--?

21:07.261 --> 21:08.306
Dad.

21:17.542 --> 21:21.118
You two, leave.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.632
Right now.

21:39.151 --> 21:43.616
So this is what you decide to throw your training away for?

21:43.617 --> 21:47.196
This is better than mozart?

21:47.441 --> 21:49.957
Mozart rocked out in his day.

21:50.654 --> 21:51.689
You taught me that.

21:51.690 --> 21:52.900
You want to waste your time,

21:52.901 --> 21:54.963
I can't stop you.

21:55.471 --> 21:59.127
But what I can't forgive you for is wasting mine.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.805
After that,

22:02.806 --> 22:04.441
my dad and I stopped.

22:04.442 --> 22:05.597
Everything.

22:05.598 --> 22:06.940
Talking,

22:06.941 --> 22:08.806
being in the same room.

22:10.051 --> 22:11.679
Jared became my family.

22:12.555 --> 22:14.357
I guess he still is.

22:14.823 --> 22:17.754
So, brandon's dad shows up and you what?

22:17.755 --> 22:20.337
Beat him up, and then decide to wreck my store?

22:20.338 --> 22:22.185
It was bad enough that I died and couldn't play anymore.

22:22.186 --> 22:24.005
But then I followed brandon to his next gig

22:24.006 --> 22:26.357
and saw that douche mucking around with the sound.

22:26.358 --> 22:28.651
Disrupted, made brandon play like crap.

22:28.652 --> 22:30.585
Wh--what--what's he saying?

22:30.586 --> 22:32.441
He says your dad was affecting your playing,

22:32.442 --> 22:33.373
and the rumble we felt?

22:33.374 --> 22:35.228
That was his way of fighting him off.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.443
Good intentions aside,

22:36.444 --> 22:38.262
this is not solving the problem.

22:38.263 --> 22:40.077
Your dad wants you to finish the symphony,

22:40.078 --> 22:42.015
and he's not gonna cross over until he does that.

22:42.016 --> 22:43.124
Well, maybe there's a third option.

22:43.125 --> 22:47.161
Maybe mr. Father of the year needs to accept who his son is.

22:47.162 --> 22:48.711
Once he leaves brandon alone,

22:48.712 --> 22:50.449
I'll leave him alone.

22:54.310 --> 22:55.489
Oh!

22:55.490 --> 22:56.431
Hello?

22:56.432 --> 22:59.078
Hey, mel. It's me.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.410
Is everything ok?

23:00.411 --> 23:02.754
No, actually.I'm a little freaked out.

23:02.755 --> 23:06.244
You know, ned was very jumpy the whole car ride home and all through dinner.

23:06.245 --> 23:09.625
And then he told me that he had to go do something and...

23:09.781 --> 23:11.157
I can't find him.

23:11.158 --> 23:13.185
Would you want jim and I to help you look for him?

23:13.186 --> 23:16.375
I feel like I should give it an hour or so before...

23:16.972 --> 23:18.742
I really lose my mind. Ok?

23:18.743 --> 23:19.751
So--but if you see him--

23:19.752 --> 23:22.268
if you see him at the store or in the square,

23:22.269 --> 23:24.432
will you call me, please?

23:24.433 --> 23:26.531
Will you bring him home?
(Text from Ned:you see ghosts!)

23:26.532 --> 23:28.072
thank you so much.

23:32.683 --> 23:33.949
Ned.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.981
Am I wrong?

23:35.982 --> 23:37.456
I want you to listen to me very closely.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.725
We cannot tell your mom.

23:38.726 --> 23:40.646
-- Why not?
-- It's complicated.

23:40.647 --> 23:42.993
So, you can help this guitarist guy,

23:42.994 --> 23:44.228
but you can't help me?

23:44.229 --> 23:45.679
With what, ned?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.660
What can I possibly help you with?

23:47.984 --> 23:49.965
I need you to find my dad.

23:50.375 --> 23:51.985
After he died--

23:51.986 --> 23:54.371
when I was young...er--

23:54.753 --> 23:56.318
I thought I saw him.

23:56.319 --> 23:58.390
My mom just told me I imagined it.

23:59.358 --> 24:01.688
But I wasn't, was I?

24:01.689 --> 24:04.097
No. No, you weren'T.

24:04.296 --> 24:06.600
So, you can still see my dad?

24:07.067 --> 24:09.405
No. It doesn't really work that way.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.765
Why not?

24:11.352 --> 24:14.294
Because I have no control over which ghosts appear to me.

24:14.295 --> 24:16.041
You helped that other guy's dad!

24:16.042 --> 24:20.365
And I heard you saying that ghosts give you signs and messages.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.891
That's just what my mom needs.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.610
A message.

24:25.066 --> 24:27.480
'Cause my mom is hurting.

24:32.199 --> 24:33.757
Ned,where you going?

24:34.006 --> 24:35.017
Home.

24:35.018 --> 24:37.110
Don't worry.I'll be fine.

24:37.111 --> 24:39.213
Thanks for your help.

24:48.094 --> 24:49.734
Want anything to eat?

24:52.051 --> 24:54.061
You don't see charlie anywhere, do you?

24:54.636 --> 24:55.912
No.

24:56.977 --> 25:00.018
And the worst part is that I wish I could tell delia and ned that he's here.

25:00.019 --> 25:01.698
But he's not.

25:02.582 --> 25:05.684
Have I ever told you how happy I am I'm--

25:06.397 --> 25:07.824
I'm not you.

25:08.193 --> 25:09.507
Well, that's not helping.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.017
It's not the weight of what you do,

25:11.018 --> 25:12.704
it's the responsibility.

25:12.705 --> 25:13.759
I mean, how you have to do it.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.679
For example,on one hand

25:15.680 --> 25:18.928
you have to convince brandon not hide his gift.

25:19.990 --> 25:22.164
But then on the other hand...

25:22.785 --> 25:26.207
you've been doing exactly that yourself with ned and delia.

25:26.465 --> 25:27.784
So, you think I should tell her.

25:27.785 --> 25:28.772
No. No.

25:28.773 --> 25:30.719
You should come clean with delia when you feel its right.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.659
And not because ned's got you boxed into a corner.

25:32.660 --> 25:33.918
But...

25:34.649 --> 25:38.713
what I do think is that you should let me talk to ned.

25:38.926 --> 25:41.107
You got too much on your plate already.

25:44.327 --> 25:45.878
Thank you.

25:47.940 --> 25:50.054
It's what I'm here for.

25:56.684 --> 25:58.865
You're not getting the string section.

25:58.866 --> 26:00.274
You're too sweet.

26:00.275 --> 26:02.222
The notes are sweet.

26:02.724 --> 26:05.556
You don't have to play it so sweetly.

26:06.811 --> 26:09.913
you are not giving it
you are not giving it

26:13.005 --> 26:15.670
-- Patrick.
-- You have to help brandon with the tenth.

26:15.671 --> 26:17.781
I've done everything that I can.

26:17.782 --> 26:20.761
The reason that you're still here is because of your selfishness.

26:20.762 --> 26:22.670
Brandon is not going to complete your symphony.

26:22.671 --> 26:24.071
It's not my tenth.

26:24.072 --> 26:25.800
My son's--

26:43.961 --> 26:46.954
Did you guys ever record a tenth track for the cd?

26:47.235 --> 26:49.387
It was just something he was messing with.

26:49.388 --> 26:50.985
When he and jared were figuring out the track order,

26:50.986 --> 26:52.129
it didn't make the cut.

26:52.130 --> 26:53.308
I don't know what happened to it.

26:53.309 --> 26:54.824
But sandy would.

26:55.227 --> 26:57.380
She was with jared the whole time.

26:57.381 --> 26:59.360
She went through enough after the crash.

26:59.361 --> 27:00.578
I don't want to drag her back into this.

27:00.579 --> 27:03.534
I wouldn't bring it up unless it was really important.

27:04.153 --> 27:05.754
If brandon can get through this song,

27:05.755 --> 27:08.043
maybe it'll help him play again.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.268
Sammy, hi, I'm melinda.

27:23.327 --> 27:24.985
Hi. Can I help you?

27:24.986 --> 27:28.389
Actually I was hoping that we could talk about the crimson doves.

27:28.710 --> 27:31.553
Man, I haven't thought about those guys in a while.

27:31.554 --> 27:33.974
So, you didn't keep in touch with brandon?

27:34.960 --> 27:36.250
No.

27:36.441 --> 27:39.505
I was hoping you would shed some light on song number 10.

27:40.121 --> 27:42.074
There were only nine cutson the album.

27:42.075 --> 27:43.395
Yeah. But you'll remember the song.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.650
It was the one with the chords that jared wasn't crazy about.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.922
Why don't you go talk to brandon?

27:51.236 --> 27:53.040
Well, because it's complicated.

27:53.453 --> 27:55.655
I think that jared got in brandon's way.

27:55.656 --> 27:56.774
And if i talk to brandon,

27:56.775 --> 28:00.004
all I'm gonna get is an earful about how great his best friend was.

28:00.005 --> 28:02.655
So, you go to the girlfriend for the real story.

28:02.753 --> 28:04.850
What makes you think I'm gonna be anymore honest.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.354
Because you were there.

28:07.148 --> 28:10.621
There's a reason that that song came between them, isn't there?

28:12.249 --> 28:14.848
It was about you, wasn't it?

28:21.957 --> 28:23.554
Did jared know?

28:24.540 --> 28:26.157
He must have been furious to find out

28:26.158 --> 28:28.631
that his best friend had feelings for his girl.

28:28.632 --> 28:31.699
He was. But not because the song was about me.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.389
Then what was he upset about?

28:33.390 --> 28:35.964
At how good the song was.

28:36.526 --> 28:37.711
See,

28:37.712 --> 28:41.150
everybody knew that brandon was scary talented.

28:41.151 --> 28:43.541
That's why jared wanted him in the band to begin with.

28:43.932 --> 28:46.196
And the only person who couldn't see it was brandon.

28:46.197 --> 28:48.130
But after he wrote that song--

28:48.131 --> 28:50.643
he started outgrowing jared.

28:51.887 --> 28:56.376
They had a fight about whether or not the song was going on the cd.

28:56.377 --> 28:58.324
The record company wanted it.

28:58.325 --> 29:00.444
Brandon wanted it. But...

29:01.456 --> 29:02.809
jared didn'T.

29:02.810 --> 29:05.227
He got on that plane to come back to the studio

29:05.228 --> 29:07.507
and remove it personally.

29:08.687 --> 29:10.698
Only he never made it.

29:12.058 --> 29:13.763
After the funeral,

29:14.158 --> 29:17.638
brandon gathered every recording he'd made of the song.

29:18.568 --> 29:20.059
Stop it.

29:20.136 --> 29:21.808
Just leave me alone.

29:23.616 --> 29:25.512
Get out of here!

29:27.285 --> 29:28.786
Leave me alone.

29:33.769 --> 29:35.499
He burnt everything?

29:36.353 --> 29:39.353
He thought he was honoring jared's wishes.

29:40.650 --> 29:44.519
I really thought you were going to be able to help me get him to play again.

29:46.589 --> 29:48.274
Just wait a second.

29:58.072 --> 30:00.518
This is the first demo he ever made of it.

30:00.586 --> 30:02.586
The one with lyrics.

30:03.753 --> 30:06.048
He wanted to know what I thought about it.

30:07.934 --> 30:09.979
Tell him I cherished it.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.555
Hey, delia. Excellent.

30:19.752 --> 30:21.141
Hey, I was actually looking for ned.

30:21.142 --> 30:23.008
And I was wondering if...

30:27.450 --> 30:29.527
you're crying.What's wrong?

30:29.528 --> 30:30.801
Nothing.

30:31.113 --> 30:33.238
Mel told me, um...

30:34.238 --> 30:35.916
today would be charlie's birthday, right?

30:35.917 --> 30:37.101
Yeah.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.325
That...

30:39.660 --> 30:42.455
and I really miss hanging out with my son.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.808
I'm sorry, jim.You didn't ask for this.

30:46.130 --> 30:48.245
If you ever want to talk about it...

30:55.317 --> 30:56.933
that's charlie.

30:58.599 --> 31:00.144
You look very happy.

31:00.279 --> 31:01.689
We were.

31:03.313 --> 31:05.508
For 12 long years.

31:06.132 --> 31:09.231
We're ready.We got 13 seconds.

31:10.547 --> 31:12.409
Smile.

31:14.071 --> 31:17.200
And then one day he stopped at an atm.

31:17.622 --> 31:19.593
He got robbed and...

31:21.486 --> 31:24.416
god, I hate crying when I'm trying to make a point.

31:24.417 --> 31:25.713
That's all right.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.769
They got into a big argument the night before.

31:30.770 --> 31:32.668
Ned just wanted to get his allowance early

31:32.669 --> 31:34.595
so he could buy this game.

31:34.839 --> 31:36.926
Charlie told him he'd have to wait.

31:37.285 --> 31:39.715
So, ned called him an asshat.

31:40.290 --> 31:41.951
Is that even a word?

31:41.952 --> 31:43.442
I don't really know.

31:44.170 --> 31:48.348
So, we grounded him more on principle than anything else.

31:48.349 --> 31:51.747
And charlie was gonna let him off the hook the next day, but...

31:52.586 --> 31:54.619
he never came home.

31:55.968 --> 31:59.471
That's why I want to celebrat his birthday every year--

31:59.472 --> 32:01.193
so that...

32:01.943 --> 32:06.030
ned can remember all the good things about his dad.

32:12.286 --> 32:14.904
Hey, kid--you and me.Let's talk.

32:14.905 --> 32:15.588
Uh-oh.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.453
What makes you say that?

32:17.454 --> 32:18.490
You coming to me,

32:18.491 --> 32:19.668
out of the blue?

32:19.669 --> 32:20.768
I know what comes next,

32:20.769 --> 32:22.083
you threaten me to stay quiet.

32:22.084 --> 32:25.669
Well, it's a good thing I left the pliers back in the van.

32:25.670 --> 32:28.366
Listen, my wife tells me sometimes

32:28.367 --> 32:30.923
you used to see your dad after he died.

32:31.185 --> 32:32.331
Sit down.

32:38.352 --> 32:40.998
I was on pretty bad terms when my dad died.

32:41.333 --> 32:45.292
And after I just kicked myself for not saying...

32:47.872 --> 32:49.604
all the things I wanted to.

32:49.605 --> 32:52.981
But then melinda told me something that really helped.

32:52.982 --> 32:54.900
She didn't see my dad anywhere.

32:55.010 --> 32:56.021
That's a good thing?

32:56.022 --> 32:57.201
That's a great thing.

32:57.202 --> 33:00.112
'Cause it meant that he crossed over, you know.

33:00.866 --> 33:02.160
Into the light.

33:02.366 --> 33:04.579
What is that, heaven?

33:05.458 --> 33:07.928
I think it's a place the dead go to be at peace.

33:07.930 --> 33:10.031
And they only go there

33:10.032 --> 33:13.292
when the people they've left behind are ok.

33:15.105 --> 33:17.828
My dad isn't here anymore, is he?

33:22.201 --> 33:24.372
-- You got a phone?
-- Yeah.

33:30.498 --> 33:32.034
This is my cell.

33:32.270 --> 33:34.506
You want to talk to me about guy stuff,

33:34.507 --> 33:36.406
I'm a phone call away.

33:36.407 --> 33:38.012
This is how it works.

33:38.387 --> 33:41.898
We don't tell anybody about what melinda can do, ok?

33:41.899 --> 33:44.216
I'll keep any secret you want.

33:44.449 --> 33:45.777
You keep this one.

33:45.778 --> 33:47.185
deal?

33:48.200 --> 33:50.007
All right.I gotta go to work.

33:54.893 --> 33:56.037
Clancy.

33:56.038 --> 33:57.493
Can I come?

34:08.304 --> 34:10.233
How long has jared been doing this to you?

34:10.234 --> 34:11.574
I don't know.

34:11.576 --> 34:13.518
When the doctor said I was dying,

34:13.518 --> 34:15.621
I tried to reach out to brandon.

34:15.623 --> 34:18.389
Tell him I was sorry.

34:18.946 --> 34:20.719
I--I was so scared.

34:21.118 --> 34:23.730
After the way I treated him.

34:24.016 --> 34:25.991
Is that why you stayed behind?

34:26.456 --> 34:28.165
To apologize?

34:28.257 --> 34:29.356
No.

34:30.161 --> 34:32.860
Something in my life was unfinished.

34:33.408 --> 34:35.609
I thought it was my symphony.

34:36.114 --> 34:39.321
And then I saw my son perform.

34:39.322 --> 34:42.661
He was beautiful.

34:43.310 --> 34:44.809
I couldn't believe it.

34:44.810 --> 34:50.159
Couldn't believe that I had never let myself...

34:51.172 --> 34:52.953
see him.

34:53.127 --> 34:57.063
He kept on getting in the way.

34:57.270 --> 34:58.369
-- Jared.
-- Yes.

34:58.370 --> 35:03.115
From the beginning it was him destroying brandon's playing.

35:03.116 --> 35:06.042
But every time I try to stop him,

35:06.201 --> 35:07.619
he drains me.

35:07.620 --> 35:09.905
I think jared is using you.

35:10.198 --> 35:12.116
The sadness over what you lost with brandon,

35:12.117 --> 35:13.469
it's only making him stronger.

35:13.470 --> 35:14.929
You have to fight him.

35:15.023 --> 35:16.430
I can'T.

35:17.438 --> 35:19.796
I've got nothing left.

35:50.024 --> 35:52.140
You know I've been searching for this demo for years?

35:52.141 --> 35:54.420
And look at that--you lead me right to it.

35:54.827 --> 35:56.145
No. Wait!

35:59.867 --> 36:02.429
You don't want brandon to play the song.I get it.

36:03.174 --> 36:04.606
There's a better way,jared.

36:04.607 --> 36:06.894
Oh, you mean your little peace, love and understanding white light?

36:06.895 --> 36:08.443
Yeah. I've seen it.

36:08.444 --> 36:12.775
What you don't get is that I can do what every rock star dreams of now.

36:12.776 --> 36:14.500
I can make people tremble.

36:14.501 --> 36:16.602
I can make the earth move.

36:16.603 --> 36:18.616
Why get in brandon's way?

36:18.617 --> 36:20.520
I made brandon who he is.

36:20.521 --> 36:22.509
And I can take it away.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.200
What do you have on your side?

36:24.201 --> 36:26.611
Puppy dogs and rainbows?

36:27.151 --> 36:29.924
Brandon's dad means nothing to me.

36:29.925 --> 36:31.894
And neither do you.

36:31.895 --> 36:33.591
I'm not crossing over.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.059
Ever!

36:40.279 --> 36:42.456
I don't understand why you're asking me to do this.

36:42.457 --> 36:45.479
My dad is not going to let me play my music.

36:49.633 --> 36:50.849
You see?

36:50.968 --> 36:53.616
Your father isn't the one that's been getting in your way.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.575
It's jared.

36:55.576 --> 36:56.545
He wouldn't do that.

36:56.546 --> 36:57.567
Yes, he would.

36:57.568 --> 37:00.566
He was jealous about the song you wrote for sandy.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.205
I destroyed that song.

37:02.283 --> 37:04.250
That wasn't good enough.

37:04.251 --> 37:07.324
He was threatened by how good you are.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.980
And the person who wasn't was your father.

37:10.151 --> 37:15.381
Tell him the first song was inspired,

37:15.637 --> 37:17.736
glenn gould-esque.

37:18.431 --> 37:22.216
He said the first song on your cd was like glenn gould.

37:22.217 --> 37:25.418
He...listened to my music?

37:25.419 --> 37:26.934
Yes.

37:27.251 --> 37:29.582
Why couldn't he tell me that when he was alive?

37:29.583 --> 37:31.067
Because he hated you.

37:31.277 --> 37:33.449
Brandon, your father wants to help you.

37:33.864 --> 37:35.452
He wants you to sing sandy's song

37:35.453 --> 37:37.779
and everything else you've ever written.

37:37.780 --> 37:41.301
Maybe this will help.

38:16.856 --> 38:18.381
What happened?!

38:20.314 --> 38:22.367
It's jared.He's hurting your father.

38:22.368 --> 38:24.054
You can't just keep doing this.

38:24.055 --> 38:25.595
Want to bet?

38:29.296 --> 38:30.700
Is that it?

38:44.755 --> 38:47.233
You can break all the strings you want, man.

38:47.405 --> 38:50.786
No one is going to stop me from playing anymore.

39:14.791 --> 39:22.719
* Don't lie and say that it's ok *

39:28.120 --> 39:39.021
* it's all right if there's nothing more to say  *

39:44.278 --> 39:46.023
* so I'm running away*
-- what does that mean?

39:47.418 --> 39:48.823
That light?

39:49.206 --> 39:51.691
It means you're ready to cross over.

39:55.284 --> 39:57.314
He's gonna be all right.

39:59.617 --> 40:01.180
Yes.

40:08.804 --> 40:16.256
* And faster than you can follow me *

40:16.257 --> 40:20.495
* follow me to this place I wish *

40:21.128 --> 40:23.833
I just wish I didn't have to go.

40:25.831 --> 40:27.328
Not now.

40:29.547 --> 40:32.522
Not just yet.

40:36.962 --> 40:39.498
it's time.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.733
Thank you.

40:51.591 --> 40:58.122
* And I wanna hear your reasons wanna hear you tell me *

40:58.123 --> 41:05.146
* why I should stay try *

41:05.736 --> 41:08.867
* try to understand me *

41:08.868 --> 41:12.863
* try to understand what I say*

41:12.864 --> 41:17.761
* when I say can't stay *

41:17.762 --> 41:25.228
* I'm ...I'm moving off of this place  leaving and I won't quit *

41:25.229 --> 41:30.093
* I'm running away *

41:31.246 --> 41:35.739
* I'm running away *

41:35.740 --> 41:41.882
* I'm leaving this place *

41:56.272 --> 41:58.185
So, how do you think the reunion tour went?

41:58.186 --> 42:00.932
Ohh, if there was a t-shirt,I would have bought it.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.283
Uh, give me a second.

42:07.284 --> 42:09.925
I have to talk to somebody.

42:14.707 --> 42:16.168
You'll be ok?

42:16.169 --> 42:17.686
Yeah. Trust me.

42:17.687 --> 42:19.906
He can't hurt anybody anymore.

42:20.974 --> 42:22.870
-- I'll be over there.
-- Ok.

42:31.418 --> 42:33.909
Just because you can sing a few songs,

42:33.910 --> 42:35.794
doesn't mean anything.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.359
Doesn't mean you'll make it.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.469
Maybe he doesn't need to make it.

42:40.804 --> 42:42.988
Maybe he just needs to play.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.145
Look, I know how angry you are right now.

42:46.146 --> 42:49.018
But if you'll let me,I can help you cross over.

42:49.732 --> 42:52.271
Think you're the only afterlife game in town?

42:52.845 --> 42:54.883
There are others around here--

42:55.274 --> 42:58.444
people who are dying to meet me.

42:58.445 --> 43:01.311
Those other spirits,they will promise you anything.

43:01.431 --> 43:02.914
They're all lying.

43:03.107 --> 43:06.430
No worse than the usual rock and roll swindle.

43:12.269 --> 43:14.450
Be seeing you.
