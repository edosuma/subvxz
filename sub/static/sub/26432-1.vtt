<i>Woodstock.</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:50.667
Student protests.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.083
<i>Hippies.</i>

00:52.250 --> 00:53.250

01:19.000 --> 01:20.958
<i>But here at home,</i>

01:21.125 --> 01:23.083
<i>time stood still.</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:28.500
<i>In our little village,
we missed out</i>

01:28.667 --> 01:31.542
<i>on everything going on
in the outside world.</i>

01:45.250 --> 01:48.167
- Ok, be good at school.
- Yes, mummy.

01:53.208 --> 01:55.125
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

03:03.750 --> 03:04.750
Hi, Werner.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.375
That's father-in-law's stuff,
it's been mended.

03:18.042 --> 03:19.958
- Thanks, therese.
- He could do with

03:20.333 --> 03:22.208
buying new things.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.575
He's much too stingy for that.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.203
- How is it going with him?
- You know what he's like.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.833
The women at the club were asking
after you. When are you coming back?

03:33.250 --> 03:35.083
We'll see.
I just don't have the time.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.083
Come on.
You can manage once a week

03:37.250 --> 03:38.690
to get away from the farm for a bit.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.125
We miss you.

03:50.542 --> 03:51.542
Hanna!

03:51.792 --> 03:53.208
Turn the music down!

03:56.833 --> 03:59.583
She is not talking to us.
Not a word. For a week now.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.625
Has something happened?

04:01.792 --> 04:03.583
We have grounded her.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.375
She is constantly
hanging around with some man.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.458
She has a new one again.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.342
Do you know what they
call her in the village?

04:13.583 --> 04:14.833
The village bike.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.708
Hanna!
For god's sake!!

04:22.958 --> 04:25.667
Nora, can you talk to her?
She might listen to you.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.000
You two have always
got along well.

04:37.667 --> 04:38.667
Did mother send you?

04:39.958 --> 04:42.042
She's worried about you.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.958
They've locked me away and banned me
from seeing gioni.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.042
Because he's got long hair.
And he's older than me.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.208
Hanna, listen

04:51.542 --> 04:54.042
as a woman, you shouldn't
just give yourself away.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.125
Once you get a bad reputation,

04:56.292 --> 04:57.667
you'll never find a decent man.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.750
I don't want to stay in this dump
and become a housewife anyway.

05:01.292 --> 05:02.917
You mean like me?

05:06.667 --> 05:07.667
With gioni,

05:07.750 --> 05:09.000
it's serious.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.167
You said that last time too.

05:11.458 --> 05:14.375
I'm fed up of this village
and all the country bumpkins.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.958
Gioni is studying in Zurich
at the art college.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.708
If gioni is the one,
he will wait for you.

05:20.042 --> 05:22.667
Until I'm an adult?
That will be another three years!

05:24.083 --> 05:25.792
I just want to
see him once more.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.833
To say goodbye.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.833
You know what?
I'll talk to therese.

05:35.542 --> 05:37.625
If I come too,
they might let you go.

05:38.167 --> 05:40.542
But you have to promise me
to do what your parents tell you.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.292
You mustn't make it
so hard for them.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.000
The pacific.

07:00.417 --> 07:03.208
It is also called the silent ocean.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.375
Or the great ocean.

07:06.375 --> 07:09.625
The pacific is home to
huge numbers of fish.

07:10.042 --> 07:12.000
And those that live right at the bottom

07:12.458 --> 07:14.583
never see the sunlight.

07:15.417 --> 07:16.750
Can you imagine that?

07:20.208 --> 07:23.542
There are all sorts of amazing creatures
living in absolute darkness

07:23.708 --> 07:25.083
and silence.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.375
Large and small.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.333
Some with spots
and some with stripes.

07:32.292 --> 07:34.375
And see-through ones.

07:35.583 --> 07:39.000
And they have no idea that
there is sunshine and light further up.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.792
I hope your measurements are right.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.583
How is our little pansy?

08:01.042 --> 08:02.833
With his pretty curls

08:03.000 --> 08:05.875
- is that a perm or are they real?
- Kuesi, that's enough.

08:06.042 --> 08:07.417
Who does your hair, darling?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.583
Don't you have any work to do?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.875
As you all know, there will be some more
restructuring this year.

08:16.375 --> 08:18.875
This will affect the staff.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.042
Mr ruckstuhl

08:23.000 --> 08:25.360
I would like to appoint you manager
of the joinery division.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.125
You will start

08:30.208 --> 08:32.048
as soon as you are back
from reserves training.

08:32.832 --> 08:34.082
Now on to something else...

08:34.542 --> 08:36.501
On the 7th of February,
there will be another vote

08:36.542 --> 08:38.500
on women's right to vote.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.457
This is exclusively the result
of propaganda from the left wing.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.643
We at the "anti-politicization of women
action committee" represent the interests

08:44.667 --> 08:48.292
of the vast majority of Swiss women
who do not want the right to vote.

08:49.292 --> 08:51.292
Our committee relies
on all the support it can get.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.625
If you are on our side,
please take a deposit form with you.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.917
We welcome even small donations.

09:17.833 --> 09:21.250
You have leadership qualities, mr
ruckstuhl. The men respect you.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.375
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
- Thank you, ma'am.

09:24.667 --> 09:27.250
Of course, you will be given a pay rise.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.583
We thought 150 francs

09:31.500 --> 09:32.500
say hello

09:32.542 --> 09:33.542
to your wife.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.375
Travel agency kuoni

10:07.542 --> 10:08.792
Nora, tea!

10:41.667 --> 10:44.000
Employees wanted.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.583
I thought miss wipf
was going to fire me.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.060
You can never tell with
people like her.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.667
Do you get more pay too?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.042
Yes, a few francs.

10:58.833 --> 10:59.833
Food is ready!

11:01.667 --> 11:02.667
Boys, food is ready!

11:03.083 --> 11:05.208
Three. One, two, three.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.083
- To hans' promotion!
- Congratulations.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.333
Department manager

11:14.542 --> 11:15.625
- cheers!
- Cheers!

11:17.250 --> 11:19.167
- Do you want water?
- I'd like some bread.

11:21.792 --> 11:24.125
I heard you want to sell
a piece of the forest

11:24.583 --> 11:26.167
I got a really good offer.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.453
You are destroying the farm.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.500
- Enjoy your meal everyone.
- Enjoy.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.667
That was the first piece of land
our family bought.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.875
You cannot flog it off!

11:35.042 --> 11:36.042
I'm sure Werner has

11:36.208 --> 11:38.167
thought about it carefully.
- Don't meddle.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.250
The farm is none of your business.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.625
- We shouldn't be talking
about this at the table.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.500
- So I'm not allowed to say what I think.

11:49.958 --> 11:51.125
I was driven from my own farm.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.875
Father-in-law,
leave your son to it.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.042
Be quiet!

11:55.792 --> 11:57.583
You have no idea
how to run a farm.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.250
And your daughter

11:59.917 --> 12:02.250
is out of control too.
What do you look like, girl?

12:03.208 --> 12:04.408
What do you mean, grandfather?

12:04.875 --> 12:07.625
- The hair or the skirt?
- Always talking back!

12:09.458 --> 12:11.208
It wouldn't have happened
in my day.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.167
Mummy, what is a village bike?

12:21.792 --> 12:23.500
It's a woman that all the men

12:24.083 --> 12:25.458
- idiot!

12:26.250 --> 12:27.917
This family should be ashamed.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.667
If you were a real man, Werner,

12:31.292 --> 12:33.250
you would do something about it.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.167
Luckily, we don't have
any girls.

12:50.708 --> 12:52.417
Boys can be tricky too.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.375
But at least they will not
come home pregnant.

12:55.958 --> 12:58.583
Girls don't get pregnant
by themselves either, hans.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.250
That's different.

13:06.958 --> 13:07.958
Listen...

13:08.083 --> 13:10.042
What would you think if I went
to work again?

13:10.750 --> 13:12.667
Work? Somewhere else?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.083
Just part time.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.750
There was an advert in the paper today
from kuoni.

13:16.917 --> 13:17.917
That's where I did

13:18.042 --> 13:19.458
my training.
Wouldn't it be good

13:19.625 --> 13:21.917
if I could earn
a little extra money too?

13:22.542 --> 13:23.542
Why?

13:23.625 --> 13:24.958
We're doing ok, aren't we?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.667
Then maybe we could

13:26.833 --> 13:28.292
afford a holiday.

13:28.458 --> 13:31.375
My little bird, next year
we'll go somewhere.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.333
I'm earning more now too.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.958
I would like
to do something different

13:44.208 --> 13:46.500
cleaning and washing socks
all the time

13:47.750 --> 13:49.000
gets boring after a while.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.542
Boring?

13:52.250 --> 13:53.292
Yes.

14:04.583 --> 14:05.583
I have got an idea

14:06.375 --> 14:09.042
I'll get you pregnant again,
then you wouldn't be bored any more.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.792
- Hans, I'm serious.
- Me too.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.750
No, stop!

14:47.500 --> 14:48.917
Good bye!

14:50.250 --> 14:51.958
Shall we meet back here?

14:52.375 --> 14:54.625
In two hours.
- What?

14:54.792 --> 14:58.125
Don't worry.
We're just going for a ride.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.520
No, absolutely not.
You cannot do that!

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Hanna!

15:06.583 --> 15:07.833
Hanna!

15:12.750 --> 15:14.458
For god's sake!

15:37.458 --> 15:39.292
Would you like
to join our association?

15:39.542 --> 15:42.250
- What association?
- The herisau womens' association.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.167
- No thank you.
- We are fighting for the liberation of women.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.250
- But I don't need to be liberated.
- Aha!

15:47.417 --> 15:49.167
So you don't feel
you need liberating?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.625
All day, it's the same thing.
I'm fed up of hearing it!

15:51.792 --> 15:54.032
It's because of women like you
that there is no progress.

15:54.167 --> 15:57.583
We need to hold together and fight,
or we will never get

15:57.750 --> 15:59.167
the right to vote!
- Luzi!

15:59.333 --> 16:00.333
That's enough.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.333
She is very passionate.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.333
I'm not actually against it.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.823
But you probably don't say out loud
that you are in favor.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.208
What's the use?
It won't make any difference.

16:12.458 --> 16:13.792
The more we push,

16:13.958 --> 16:15.708
the more the men do
what they want.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.167
Thank you!
- No, no, it does make a difference.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.208
The vote on women's right to vote
in February

16:21.375 --> 16:24.500
is thanks to all the women who have
been fighting tirelessly for 100 years.

16:25.250 --> 16:29.000
Motions, petitions,
applications, demonstrations, letters

16:29.375 --> 16:31.417
they have not let themselves be
discouraged.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.667
Especially here in the countryside,
we need brave women

16:34.833 --> 16:36.917
who dare to express their views
out loud.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.565
Take a couple of brochures with you.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.167
They explain everything better.

16:42.917 --> 16:44.000
And these,

16:44.417 --> 16:45.667
and these,

16:45.833 --> 16:47.167
and that.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.250
They are free.

16:51.625 --> 16:52.625
Thank you.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.750
Good evening.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.541
What? To Zurich?

17:23.750 --> 17:25.583
Yes, and she said
she is not coming home.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.000
She called an hour ago.

17:29.042 --> 17:30.458
<i>My god, there's.</i>

17:31.500 --> 17:32.792
I am so, so sorry.

17:32.958 --> 17:35.583
How could you leave her alone
with that man, Nora?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.476
She said they were just
going for a quick ride.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.292
She was giving you the runaround too,
just like the rest of us.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.083
There will be consequences for her.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.250
No doubt about it.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.667
I'm going to bed.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.208
Nora, it's not your fault.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.417
The way she used me like that

18:01.500 --> 18:03.417
when her bloke realizes
she has no money,

18:03.583 --> 18:05.000
she'll be back home in no time.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.750
About this job advert

18:13.375 --> 18:16.167
I've been thinking about it.
I'd be home in the evenings.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.208
We'd just have to eat
a little later.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.208
And I'm sure I can find a solution
for the boys' lunch.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.775
But we've talked
about this already.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.458
But we didn't finish.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.958
Won't it be too much for you?
The household, my father,

18:28.125 --> 18:29.125
the boys

18:29.333 --> 18:31.708
I don't want my sons having
to eat tinned ravioli.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.667
- But your sons like it.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.083
I also don't want

18:35.250 --> 18:37.083
you being around strange men
all the time.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.458
- Strange men?

18:38.625 --> 18:40.292
- Other employees,
customers, the boss!

18:40.625 --> 18:42.265
- But hans!
- And I'm sure you can imagine

18:42.292 --> 18:44.333
what it would be like at work.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.375
Ruckstuhl's wife has to go to work,
because he doesn't earn enough.

18:47.542 --> 18:49.167
I don't want that, Nora.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.875
We could at least
try it out for a bit.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.083
No, Nora.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.667
You can't do it without my
permission anyway. That is the law.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.875
- The law?
- Yes, Nora. The law.

19:00.042 --> 19:01.458
I have to go.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.658
There is the house-keeping money
for the next two weeks.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.167
<i>Swiss marriage law</i>

20:14.667 --> 20:17.667
<i>Women's suffrage</i>

20:45.917 --> 20:46.917
Mummy?

20:48.833 --> 20:50.292
When is breakfast?

20:51.125 --> 20:52.542
I'll be right there, ok?

21:17.292 --> 21:19.292
Please, do something!
I need your help.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.958
- What happened?

21:21.125 --> 21:22.250
Talk to my father!

21:22.417 --> 21:23.417
Please!

21:24.625 --> 21:28.292
This is a sensible educational measure.
We only want the best for your daughter.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.138
We at the guardianship office
have experience with cases like these.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.417
I just need your signature,
mr ruckstuhl. Here.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.000
What's going on?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.208
Administrative detention
in a children's home.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.758
Especially with young women,
this can prevent,

21:43.833 --> 21:45.000
everything going wrong.

21:45.208 --> 21:48.292
Don't you think we could talk
to Hanna again? All of us, nice and calmly.

21:48.667 --> 21:51.347
She had lots of warnings. Now it's enough.
It has to stop somewhere!

21:52.042 --> 21:53.750
She was found in a flat
in Zurich.

21:53.958 --> 21:55.708
The only girl
with lots of young men.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.542
Cannabis had been consumed.

21:59.375 --> 22:00.815
We need to protect her from herself.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.250
Therese, don't do this!

22:03.625 --> 22:05.351
Decisions of this kind
are the responsibility

22:05.375 --> 22:08.833
of the head of the family. The father has
ultimate responsibility for his children.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.875
Don't worry.
Goodbye.

22:17.917 --> 22:19.708
We just want the best for Hanna.

22:48.542 --> 22:51.500
We have a special guest
for our group today. Miss Charlotte wipf,

22:51.667 --> 22:55.167
president of the anti-politication of women
action committee.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.042
Thank you. Thanks, magda.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.184
Is it true, that Hanna was
taken into guardianship?

22:59.208 --> 23:00.351
- It is an honor for me
- yes.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.434
...to talk to the women's and mothers' club
today. - How awful for therese and Werner.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.750
How awful for Hanna.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.125
I do not need to

23:06.292 --> 23:08.417
explain to you,
why what they call emancipation

23:08.583 --> 23:10.000
is in reality a curse
for us women.

23:10.167 --> 23:12.125
Ladies, it is a privilege

23:12.292 --> 23:14.573
to be able to dedicate oneself
completely to one's family.

23:14.667 --> 23:16.792
I had to manage the
family company.

23:16.958 --> 23:19.167
That left no space for a
husband and children.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.559
So I know what I'm talking about.
Although Swiss women do not currently

23:21.583 --> 23:23.167
have the right to vote, they can

23:23.333 --> 23:25.458
use their feminine influence
to get what they want.

23:25.625 --> 23:28.667
Equality of the sexes
is a sin against nature.

23:29.083 --> 23:32.292
Ladies, women in politics
are simply against the divine order.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.333
- Bravo.
- I bet she just wants money.

23:34.708 --> 23:36.625
Every franc donated
helps support our mission.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.333
She just doesn't want to lose

23:38.750 --> 23:41.430
her position in the village.
She has these little "jobs" everywhere.

23:43.292 --> 23:44.875
I am only giving two francs.

23:45.583 --> 23:46.708
Thanks.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.125
Thank you.

23:48.750 --> 23:49.750
Thank you.

23:50.792 --> 23:51.792
Thank you.

23:53.583 --> 23:54.583
Thanks.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.042
Thanks.

23:56.167 --> 23:57.167
Many thanks.

23:57.625 --> 23:58.917
Thank you.

24:04.833 --> 24:05.833
No.

24:10.208 --> 24:11.750
I don't wish to donate,

24:14.583 --> 24:16.625
I am in favour of women's right to vote.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.458
Fortunately, your opinion
does not count, mrs ruckstuhl.

24:24.542 --> 24:27.167
I am sure your husband
will vote on our side.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.458
Thank you.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.583
Nora!

24:37.208 --> 24:40.208
Wow! I didn't think
you had it in you.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.250
Well done! I'm impressed.

24:42.417 --> 24:45.833
I was in favour in 1959. Back then,
I was the only one in the village!

24:46.000 --> 24:47.500
Now we can carry on.

24:48.471 --> 24:49.471
I'm in.

24:50.167 --> 24:51.167
You're in?

24:51.500 --> 24:54.250
Fighting for the right to vote
for us women.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.208
We can't let miss wipf
have it all her way.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.667
She thinks her opinion
is the only one that counts.

24:59.542 --> 25:00.542
Good night.

25:36.417 --> 25:37.708
Fredy,

25:37.875 --> 25:39.143
we would like to reserve
the parish hall.

25:39.167 --> 25:40.833
On 23 January.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.792
Let me have a look.

25:46.583 --> 25:47.583
The date

25:47.750 --> 25:50.333
is still free.
Who is the reservation for?

25:50.500 --> 25:51.833
I need to write it down

25:52.000 --> 25:53.583
for the local action committee

25:53.792 --> 25:55.833
for women's right to vote.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yes, exactly.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.167
- For?
- Yes, for women's right to vote, fredy.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.292
Are you deaf?

26:02.875 --> 26:05.042
You were dead against it
in 1959.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.875
Nonsense, I've always been in favour.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.375
We are organizing
an information event.

26:12.583 --> 26:14.208
An information event?

26:16.167 --> 26:19.208
"Women must remain quiet in society."
That's what it says in the Bible.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.250
Find yourselves somewhere else.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.667
"Thou shalt not commit adultery."

26:28.375 --> 26:30.417
That's in the Bible too, fredy.

26:40.792 --> 26:42.542
We need to advertise.

26:43.042 --> 26:44.958
Posters, flyers

26:45.125 --> 26:47.000
and we could offer
coffee and cakes.

26:47.833 --> 26:50.667
And we need a speaker.
The best thing would be

26:50.833 --> 26:53.583
to ask someone from the association
for women's equality.

26:55.458 --> 26:57.698
- Vroni, what are you doing?
- For god's sake, not again!

26:59.083 --> 27:02.292
You cannot take your eye off
mother for a second.

27:03.167 --> 27:05.000
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.625
An Italian took over my restaurant.

27:28.292 --> 27:30.500
A dirty, stinking garlic-eater.

27:30.583 --> 27:31.208
Mother...

27:31.333 --> 27:33.292
You can't just charge in here.

27:34.042 --> 27:35.958
I spent 40 years of my life here.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.583
I worked, day and night.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.500
Look over there,
it's your father.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.417
Ruedi.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.875
We were so young,
when we started out here.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.875
He wasted all the money on women and booze.
There was nothing

27:50.042 --> 27:52.458
left for me. Not a penny.
I am living off benefits..

27:53.833 --> 27:56.292
The miserable bastard!

27:56.583 --> 27:58.917
My pub!
- Mother, as far as I am concerned,

27:59.125 --> 28:02.083
father can rot in hell.
But you still can't come in here.

28:02.292 --> 28:03.917
You risk getting
for trespassing.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.393
- And who will pay the fine?
- The Italian, should make a report.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.875
Let them arrest me. Then I'll go
to prison and serve my time.

28:09.042 --> 28:12.059
Then at least I wouldn't have to live
in that miserable little room at yours.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.292
We did her up a lovely room.

28:14.458 --> 28:17.875
You should be grateful that we took you in.
Without us, you'd probably be

28:18.042 --> 28:19.083
living in the almshouse.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.375
- No doubt I'd be better off there.
- The pizzeria

28:21.542 --> 28:22.542
is not open yet.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.250
Excuse us.

28:30.034 --> 28:32.075
But she is the bear-vroni.

28:32.583 --> 28:33.833
The former owner.

28:35.917 --> 28:38.375
Can I offer you a coffee?

28:38.750 --> 28:41.792
No, thank you. That is very kind.
Mother

28:42.250 --> 28:44.250
yes please.
That would be lovely.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.500
When are you opening?
- Hopefully in February.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.635
Is your husband doing
the renovation himself?

28:59.667 --> 29:00.833
There is no husband.

29:01.167 --> 29:02.667
- No husband?
- Yes,

29:02.833 --> 29:04.417
no husband, any more.

29:05.625 --> 29:06.375
I'm sorry.

29:06.542 --> 29:10.458
No, no, he didn't die.
Unfortunately.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.333
We just got divorced.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.750
I'm doing the renovation myself.
There is

29:17.917 --> 29:20.417
not that much.
- How come you speak such good German?

29:20.583 --> 29:23.208
Most Italians
only know a few words.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.708
When I was young, I came
to Switzerland. For work.

29:27.875 --> 29:30.375
But then I went back again.

29:30.542 --> 29:32.042
For love. And now

29:32.208 --> 29:33.417
I'm here again.

29:33.792 --> 29:35.292
I want to make a new start.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.375
It can't be easy
without a husband.

29:38.542 --> 29:41.833
It's not easy with a husband either.
- True!

29:42.000 --> 29:43.292
You can say that again.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.792
You are always welcome here,
signora vreni.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.750
And you
if you ever need anything

29:51.000 --> 29:52.250
help or anything, then

29:52.417 --> 29:55.500
a good haircut, soon.

29:56.917 --> 29:58.708
Shall we go together?

31:05.958 --> 31:07.375
<i>Women's demo in Zurich</i>

31:09.583 --> 31:12.042
and now, let's go shopping.

31:14.042 --> 31:15.792
Okay.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.542
Application.

31:55.708 --> 31:57.542
Dear ladies and gentlemen, I would like

31:57.708 --> 31:59.917
to apply for the job as secretary...

32:08.542 --> 32:10.667
Trousers. And tight ones at that.

32:12.167 --> 32:15.375
You don't need to stare at my bottom
all the time, father-in-law.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.333
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

32:20.583 --> 32:21.875
Can I have some milk, mummy?

32:24.667 --> 32:25.792
You know where it is.

32:28.208 --> 32:30.292
And from now on,
you clear away your dirty dishes.

32:31.333 --> 32:32.792
Everyone can do their own.

32:33.542 --> 32:35.792
And you can take turns
drying up.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.500
But.. We're boys!

32:45.667 --> 32:47.958
You know how to put together
a model railway.

32:48.125 --> 32:49.583
You will be able to
dry up dishes.

32:51.458 --> 32:52.458
Thank you!

32:55.917 --> 32:57.708
Hanna ran away from reform school.

32:58.375 --> 33:00.667
Now they have chucked her into a

33:00.833 --> 33:01.958
women's prison.

33:03.667 --> 33:04.958
It's a disgrace!

33:18.042 --> 33:20.542
Is it true that Hanna is
now in a women's prison?

33:21.083 --> 33:23.708
That is what happens
to wanton women like her.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.875
But she is just a little wild.

33:27.042 --> 33:29.750
And in love. For crying out loud,
that is not a crime!

33:29.958 --> 33:31.333
It is for us, Nora.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.375
- Especially for women.
- But that's not fair.

33:33.583 --> 33:37.042
You can't just lock Hanna away
with dangerous criminals.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.219
What would you have done
if you were her mother?

33:39.516 --> 33:40.992
You've seen how she is.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.500
Can she have visitors?

33:44.875 --> 33:46.375
Werner doesn't want to.

33:46.833 --> 33:47.833
And you?

33:52.500 --> 33:54.083
You at least should visit her.

33:54.542 --> 33:55.625
She is your child!

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Nora

34:01.542 --> 34:03.042
we shouldn't get involved.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.667
He'd definitely listen to you.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.083
He has even banned therese
from visiting Hanna.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.500
I know Werner.

34:10.417 --> 34:12.458
The more you push him,
the more stubborn he gets.

34:12.917 --> 34:15.667
- You just don't want to fight with him.
- Listen, <i>Nora</i>

34:15.833 --> 34:17.625
when I'm back,
I can give it a go.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.042
But on the telephone forget it.

34:22.167 --> 34:23.167
Are you still there?

34:25.917 --> 34:27.958
Tell me, how are you going to vote?

34:28.125 --> 34:30.417
- <i>On</i> what?
<i>- Women's right to vote.</i>

34:30.917 --> 34:32.167
That's for me to know.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.500
Can't you even tell your wife?

34:34.667 --> 34:36.627
Since when have you been
interested <i>in</i> how <i>I</i> vote?

34:36.792 --> 34:38.333
I'm interested now.

34:39.583 --> 34:40.583
I am in favour.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.500
Really?

34:42.625 --> 34:44.917
But I still think that
mothers should be in the home.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.684
<i>A yes from men
for the love of women.</i>

35:00.708 --> 35:01.948
Where did you get this picture?

35:02.167 --> 35:03.417
From the album

35:03.583 --> 35:05.250
of the women's and mothers' club.

35:05.458 --> 35:07.208
No, that's not on.
That's not on at all.

35:07.375 --> 35:08.542
And what about

35:08.708 --> 35:10.833
"hosted by"?
- You're speaking.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
No, ok I'll welcome everybody,

35:14.167 --> 35:15.917
but I'm not speaking.
- You have to.

35:16.125 --> 35:17.811
We said we'd ask someone
from the association.

35:17.835 --> 35:19.232
It makes a much
better impression,

35:19.375 --> 35:21.851
when one of us speaks, instead of some
intellectual woman from the city.

35:21.875 --> 35:22.875
I think so too.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.292
Then you do it.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.500
But the whole thing was your idea!

35:29.292 --> 35:30.583
Sorry, love vreni

35:30.750 --> 35:32.875
is too old.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.708
You are the voice

35:34.875 --> 35:36.333
of the new generation, Nora.

35:36.583 --> 35:38.583
You can do it.
Definitely!

35:39.000 --> 35:41.792
Good. Now all we need
is to get together the money

35:42.000 --> 35:43.250
for the printing.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.583
<i>Ladies, mrs affolter
has tried the new omo.</i>

35:46.750 --> 35:48.375
<i>What did you think,
mrs affolter?</i>

35:48.583 --> 35:49.917
<i>See for yourself.</i>

35:50.083 --> 35:52.667
<i>The washing smells lovely,
and the stains have all gone</i>

35:52.833 --> 35:55.458
<i>and it's whiter than all the washing
I have ever washed before.</i>

35:55.625 --> 35:58.125
<i>Omo washes whites
visibly whiter.</i>

35:58.708 --> 35:59.708
Father-in-law?

36:00.250 --> 36:02.958
Hans didn't leave me
enough house-keeping money.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.750
Does hans actually
know what you're doing?

36:06.667 --> 36:08.875
- What?
- You know exactly what I mean.

36:09.458 --> 36:12.292
Fredy from the council
is telling everyone in the village.

36:13.083 --> 36:16.792
Hans will be pleased when I call and tell
him what his wife is doing behind his back.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.020
At the same time, you can tell
him all about your sex magazines.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.167
So, about the house-keeping money?

36:31.625 --> 36:32.958
<i>A male yes for women!</i>

36:33.125 --> 36:36.333
- Don't you think that's enough now?
- But we still have so many posters!

36:42.750 --> 36:43.750
Go home

36:43.792 --> 36:44.792
to your children!

36:48.292 --> 36:51.667
Come on look, over there.
We need a couple more posters over there.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.708
Is it true about
this action committee?

37:05.583 --> 37:06.583
Yes.

37:08.042 --> 37:10.833
But you've never been
interested in politics before.

37:12.458 --> 37:13.625
I am now.

37:15.292 --> 37:16.292
You know

37:16.875 --> 37:19.500
I'd love to
go out to work again.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.708
And hans can just stop me.

37:22.042 --> 37:23.125
That can't be right!

37:27.708 --> 37:29.083
We could do with some help.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.208
I don't want to talk to you.

37:37.375 --> 37:39.417
- Hanna!
- You are

37:39.583 --> 37:40.958
such a coward, mother.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.917
Hopefully I will never
be like you.

37:44.083 --> 37:45.917
You and father are dead to me.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.542
I want to go back to my room.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.667
Please, Hanna!
We need to talk

37:58.708 --> 38:01.667
Come on, therese.
We can try again in a week.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.792
It's all my fault, Nora.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.875
I just sat there
and said nothing.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.875
Because I thought,
now it's taking its toll.

38:11.042 --> 38:13.417
I was a bad mother
to my daughter

38:13.958 --> 38:15.708
I have failed, Nora.

38:15.875 --> 38:19.208
- No.
- I have ruined my child's life.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.833
What should I do?

38:27.542 --> 38:29.583
Fight, therese!

38:42.917 --> 38:43.917
Hi.

38:46.875 --> 38:48.125
We went to see Hanna today.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.583
You need to reverse
the custody order.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.125
I don't need to do anything.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.583
Do you want
it on your conscience?

38:59.208 --> 39:00.833
We made a mistake, Werner.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.958
She is still just a child.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.958
I don't want to hear any more!

39:08.667 --> 39:10.434
Things are hard enough for us
with our business.

39:10.458 --> 39:13.208
And now you are making everything worse
with yours.

39:13.833 --> 39:14.833
The whole village

39:15.000 --> 39:16.708
is laughing about those posters.

39:24.042 --> 39:26.917
Dear Swiss citizens...

39:29.208 --> 39:30.208
Where is Max?

39:30.917 --> 39:32.625
Tell him to come
and have breakfast.

39:32.792 --> 39:33.875
He is ill.

39:40.708 --> 39:42.125
What's wrong?

39:45.292 --> 39:47.167
Max, you are not ill.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.542
Come on, stand up.

39:49.167 --> 39:51.583
You need
to tidy the room up again tonight.

39:52.542 --> 39:54.208
- Go on, tell her.

39:54.875 --> 39:55.875
Tell me what?

39:57.208 --> 39:58.667
He doesn't want to go to school.

39:58.917 --> 40:02.417
- Why not?
- Because of you! Everyone's laughing at us.

40:03.458 --> 40:04.958
They say you're a kipper.

40:05.167 --> 40:08.500
A libber, stupid, a women's libber.
A woman who wants to be a man.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.917
Bert doesn't want to sit
next to me anymore.

40:13.083 --> 40:15.667
And he doesn't want
to be my friend either.

40:15.917 --> 40:18.333
And there are a couple of others too.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.250
Are you coming now or not?

40:28.458 --> 40:30.000
I think we should go to hear

40:30.250 --> 40:33.333
what the young people are saying.
I've never been

40:33.500 --> 40:34.542
to a demo

40:35.000 --> 40:37.125
vreni, we need to cancel

40:37.292 --> 40:38.292
our event.

40:39.958 --> 40:40.958
Cancel?

40:41.792 --> 40:42.875
No! But why?

40:43.042 --> 40:44.667
Has hans talked you around?

40:44.833 --> 40:47.042
No, he doesn't know about it.

40:47.958 --> 40:50.375
My boys are getting teased at school.
- All the more reason

40:50.542 --> 40:51.917
to fight back!

40:52.083 --> 40:53.243
I need to think of my family.

40:54.958 --> 40:56.333
And everybody will know why.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
Because we got scared.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.625
You should have thought about
that earlier.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.708
We will make ourselves a laughing stock.

41:03.875 --> 41:05.792
It's exactly what everyone expected.

41:12.250 --> 41:13.292
Didn't you say,

41:13.458 --> 41:14.578
you could do with some help?

41:16.125 --> 41:18.625
<i>There's, what has happened'?</i>

41:19.125 --> 41:21.750
Nothing. I just bumped
into the kitchen cupboard.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.000
If I can't help my Hanna,

41:27.167 --> 41:30.042
then at least her mother shouldn't be
an embarrassment to her any more.

41:44.292 --> 41:45.458
Yes, we could do with help.

41:48.042 --> 41:49.042
You see.

41:51.167 --> 41:53.125
Are we going to the demo in Zurich
or not?

41:53.958 --> 41:55.833
Women's rights are human rights!

41:56.000 --> 41:58.042
Women's rights are human rights!

41:58.208 --> 42:02.083
Women's rights are human rights!
Women's rights are human rights!

42:02.250 --> 42:04.375
Women's rights are human rights!

42:04.542 --> 42:06.625
Women's rights are human rights!

42:13.417 --> 42:15.208
I'm starting to feel
a bit old here.

42:15.375 --> 42:17.792
We can get the next train home.

42:20.083 --> 42:21.958
Come on.
Let's join in!

42:22.500 --> 42:23.792
Let's go.

42:24.333 --> 42:27.042
We don't want to be branded
as maids,

42:27.208 --> 42:29.667
cleaners and objects of lust

42:29.833 --> 42:31.625
any more.

42:31.792 --> 42:34.333
Our men should clean
their own shoes.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.708
And wash their own socks.

42:38.125 --> 42:41.375
Feminism is
the greatest social revolution

42:41.542 --> 42:42.958
of this century!

42:43.833 --> 42:45.833
It's about the right to abortion

42:46.000 --> 42:48.667
and equal pay.
It's about marital law.

42:49.417 --> 42:50.833
You lot need

42:51.000 --> 42:52.333
a proper seeing-to.

42:52.500 --> 42:53.500
What?!

42:55.625 --> 42:57.792
It is about complete social,

42:57.958 --> 43:01.583
political and economical equality
for women!

43:05.833 --> 43:07.833
Women's rights are human rights!

43:09.250 --> 43:12.167
Women's rights are human rights!

43:17.792 --> 43:21.167
<i>Down with the patriarchy!</i>

43:27.458 --> 43:29.667
Glad you came to the workshop.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.625
There's a party afterwards.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.167
Oh, really? - Yes.

43:39.708 --> 43:40.833
Hi.

43:41.167 --> 43:44.000
I am indra.
I come from Sweden.

43:44.417 --> 43:48.000
Welcome to my workshop
"weibliche kraft".

43:48.250 --> 43:50.250
Female power.

43:50.792 --> 43:52.333
Yoni power.

43:53.167 --> 43:55.250
We all have it.

43:55.750 --> 43:57.417
We all have it!

43:57.833 --> 43:59.625
The fight against

43:59.792 --> 44:02.708
the suppression of women
goes hand in hand

44:02.875 --> 44:05.792
with the fight against
sexual oppression.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.875
In other words:
Sexual norms

44:10.250 --> 44:13.500
are political instruments
of oppression.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.958
The personal is political.

44:17.292 --> 44:19.375
The private is political.

44:19.542 --> 44:21.208
And this is why we need

44:21.375 --> 44:23.417
to get to know our vaginas better.

44:26.833 --> 44:29.000
The eye of god!

44:30.958 --> 44:33.917
- What did she say?
- Nothing. Something blasphemous.

44:34.083 --> 44:35.208
- Ah, ok.
- Outer labia.

44:35.375 --> 44:37.250
Inner labia.

44:37.417 --> 44:39.875
And clitoris.

44:41.042 --> 44:42.042
All of you...

44:42.208 --> 44:44.250
Say clitoris.

44:44.458 --> 44:46.333
Clitoris.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.208
Again, louder.

44:49.375 --> 44:51.208
Clitoris!

44:51.375 --> 44:52.375
Good.

44:53.792 --> 44:56.833
Every vulva is unique,

44:57.042 --> 44:58.958
and wonderful.

44:59.042 --> 45:01.375
Like a snowflake.

45:03.958 --> 45:04.958
Oh, god!

45:10.125 --> 45:11.375
Tiger...

45:11.583 --> 45:13.875
Bunny, butterfly...

45:15.250 --> 45:16.667
Shark...

45:16.833 --> 45:18.375
Fox...

45:18.542 --> 45:20.333
Squirrel...

45:20.708 --> 45:22.167
Lion...

45:22.333 --> 45:23.333
Hedgehog,

45:24.042 --> 45:25.375
and wolf.

45:27.042 --> 45:29.083
Knowing your pussy

45:29.250 --> 45:31.750
is the key to your lust.

45:32.292 --> 45:34.167
And the first step

45:34.333 --> 45:35.417
towards freedom.

45:38.750 --> 45:40.792
So now

45:41.208 --> 45:42.458
let's have a look.

45:44.167 --> 45:47.000
- No.
- We're not doing that.

45:47.167 --> 45:49.458
- I'm not doing that.
- We should go.

45:49.625 --> 45:52.208
Now.
- Won't we look silly

45:52.375 --> 45:54.250
if we just go now?

46:02.458 --> 46:05.708
Ok, good. If it does no good,
it does no harm either.

46:10.417 --> 46:13.708
I am 45 and have never
looked at myself down there.

46:14.667 --> 46:16.042
So why not?

46:22.125 --> 46:23.125
And now...

46:24.375 --> 46:25.375
Undress.

46:25.458 --> 46:27.208
Take your clothes off.

46:47.833 --> 46:51.000
Take a good, loving look!

46:54.167 --> 46:56.708
Take a loving look!

46:57.708 --> 46:59.417
With love

47:04.833 --> 47:06.292
A butterfly.

47:07.167 --> 47:08.500
A silver fox.

47:09.875 --> 47:11.292
A tiger.

47:11.708 --> 47:12.875
I am sure

47:13.083 --> 47:15.125
that in this room,

47:15.292 --> 47:17.250
there are lots of women who have never

47:17.417 --> 47:19.042
had an orgasm.

47:20.250 --> 47:22.458
Love your vaginas

47:22.792 --> 47:25.875
...and the orgasm will come.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.580
We would have been better
taking the last train home.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.417
I feel really sick.

49:07.125 --> 49:08.167
No, thanks.

49:08.875 --> 49:10.292
I wish I could just
sleep like that.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.542
Mr ruckstuhl, I hope
you will bring your wife to her senses

50:22.750 --> 50:24.875
You said
you wouldn't be home until this afternoon.

50:26.875 --> 50:28.000
What's this all about?

50:28.667 --> 50:30.875
We are telling people
about women's right to vote.

50:31.083 --> 50:32.163
Come on, Nora, we're going.

50:32.917 --> 50:33.958
I can't do that, hans.

50:34.125 --> 50:36.292
Of course you can.
You're coming now. No arguments.

50:37.292 --> 50:38.417
When is it starting?

50:39.875 --> 50:40.958
We need to start.

50:43.333 --> 50:44.708
Welcome

50:45.292 --> 50:47.000
to our

50:47.667 --> 50:48.833
is it over already?

51:00.625 --> 51:03.000
Dear women, dear men,

51:03.167 --> 51:04.417
dear citizens.

51:04.625 --> 51:07.542
Welcome to our information event

51:07.708 --> 51:10.000
on women's right to vote.

51:11.458 --> 51:12.958
On women's right to vote.

51:13.958 --> 51:15.375
We organised this event

51:15.583 --> 51:18.375
because we think
that it is important...

51:18.583 --> 51:19.833
Louder!

51:22.375 --> 51:23.375
Gentlemen,

51:23.417 --> 51:27.083
a little discipline, please!
- Sorry.

51:27.875 --> 51:30.167
With this event,

51:30.333 --> 51:32.292
we want to show,

51:32.458 --> 51:35.792
that there are people here in the village
who are more than willing

51:35.958 --> 51:38.250
to stand up for women's rights to vote.

51:38.542 --> 51:39.875
Exactly three people!

51:44.250 --> 51:47.542
Unfortunately, there are still
some false impressions on the subject

51:47.708 --> 51:49.750
in some people's heads.

51:50.417 --> 51:53.667
In New Zealand and in Sweden,

51:53.833 --> 51:57.208
Iran, Afghanistan, Finland,

51:57.375 --> 51:59.000
Italy, yugoslavia,

51:59.167 --> 52:02.708
Bulgaria, Mongolia, Mexico,
Germany, etc.

52:02.875 --> 52:05.458
What the opposition predicted,

52:05.625 --> 52:09.167
has not come true.
On the contrary!

52:09.917 --> 52:12.167
Today, many women
go out to work.

52:12.333 --> 52:14.292
They have careers

52:14.458 --> 52:17.667
and they pay taxes.
So they must be allowed to vote too.

52:17.875 --> 52:19.250
Objection, mrs ruckstuhl.

52:19.417 --> 52:20.542
There are also foreigners

52:20.708 --> 52:23.417
who pay taxes.
Should people

52:23.625 --> 52:25.167
who have no idea
about Switzerland

52:25.333 --> 52:28.667
be able to influence
our federal politics?

52:28.833 --> 52:29.833
Bravo!

52:37.208 --> 52:40.208
There are 1.9 million women
living in Switzerland.

52:40.375 --> 52:43.250
And they are ruled by
1,6 million men.

52:43.458 --> 52:45.208
The men make the laws.

52:46.167 --> 52:48.917
But these laws affect us too.

52:49.125 --> 52:51.875
In general, things are good for us women
in Switzerland, aren't they?

52:52.083 --> 52:53.792
So the men aren't

52:53.958 --> 52:55.375
doing a bad job for us.

52:55.542 --> 52:57.875
But we want to be a part
of the law-making process

52:58.500 --> 53:01.250
and not be reliant
on the goodwill of men.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.083
But we don't want a "five-to-twelve" woman

53:04.250 --> 53:05.610
who just opens a tin at lunchtime.

53:05.708 --> 53:07.000
And besides,

53:07.167 --> 53:09.583
I don't want to discuss
politics with my wife.

53:09.792 --> 53:11.208
We would end up with arguments

53:11.375 --> 53:12.917
in the family
- and most women

53:13.083 --> 53:14.750
don't want to vote anyway.

53:14.917 --> 53:16.667
But that's not true!

53:16.875 --> 53:18.333
How many of you men here

53:18.500 --> 53:20.542
have actually asked your wives
about it?

53:25.958 --> 53:26.958
Maybe

53:27.042 --> 53:30.375
we should take this opportunity
to vote and see.

53:30.542 --> 53:33.083
With the women. All together.

53:34.458 --> 53:36.583
Yes, er

53:37.500 --> 53:38.750
good idea.

53:41.583 --> 53:44.208
Who in this room is in favour?

53:44.458 --> 53:47.958
In favour of the right to vote for women.

54:02.208 --> 54:03.208
And

54:03.250 --> 54:04.833
who is against?

55:12.833 --> 55:14.292
Are you completely mad?

55:17.417 --> 55:19.768
How can you betray me like that
in front of all those people?

55:19.792 --> 55:23.292
Me betray you? You made me
a laughing stock. In front of my workmates,

55:23.458 --> 55:24.792
and my boss,
and all those people.

55:24.958 --> 55:26.792
On the telephone, you said
you were in favour.

55:26.958 --> 55:28.184
But I don't need
to tell the whole village!

55:28.208 --> 55:29.500
You'd rather betray your wife.

55:32.292 --> 55:34.292
What on earth is up
with you, Nora?

55:37.042 --> 55:39.042
You want to forbid me
from going to work.

55:40.667 --> 55:42.292
Hanna is in prison.

55:43.667 --> 55:45.667
And vreni has nothing
that belongs to her any more.

55:46.250 --> 55:48.375
And none of that is fair.

55:49.292 --> 55:50.375
Do you know what?

55:51.083 --> 55:52.412
There are lots of things
I think are not fair.

55:52.436 --> 55:53.824
But I don't make such
a fuss about it!

55:53.848 --> 55:56.792
They threw things at me, and you
did nothing. You didn't say a word.

55:56.958 --> 55:58.708
What did you expect?
Be grateful

55:58.917 --> 56:00.167
it was only paper.

56:00.417 --> 56:02.500
And now, I'd like to know
where you were last night.

56:04.083 --> 56:06.625
At a demonstration.
In Zurich.

56:07.875 --> 56:10.417
And afterwards
we went to a party.

56:10.667 --> 56:13.083
Ah, at a demonstration.

56:13.833 --> 56:15.292
And afterwards you went to a party.

56:16.254 --> 56:18.411
And who with, if you don't
mind me asking, Nora?

56:18.709 --> 56:19.950
And all night?

56:21.708 --> 56:23.250
How dare you talk to me like that!

56:29.458 --> 56:30.458
I want an answer,

56:30.500 --> 56:31.500
Nora!

56:37.792 --> 56:40.500
There is a tiger
between my legs, hans.

56:41.375 --> 56:42.542
A tiger.

56:43.500 --> 56:46.208
And I have never had an orgasm.

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
So there.

56:58.958 --> 57:01.083
What is an orgasm, daddy?

57:02.583 --> 57:05.542
- That was terrible.
- Cheeky and disrespectful.

57:05.708 --> 57:08.125
I didn't speak a word to my husband
for the whole of lunch.

57:08.833 --> 57:11.667
But none of you opened your mouths
and said something.

57:12.750 --> 57:14.917
I was the only one back in 1959.

57:15.083 --> 57:16.363
You can't blame us for anything.

57:16.500 --> 57:19.458
Everyone knows you were against back then.
Like all of us.

57:21.542 --> 57:24.000
- And what do you want to do now?
- Nothing.

57:24.167 --> 57:25.208
The vote

57:25.417 --> 57:28.000
showed that not even
the women are in favour.

57:29.167 --> 57:31.042
But that's not true.

57:32.125 --> 57:33.583
I am in favour

57:33.750 --> 57:36.625
lots of women in the club
share your views, Nora.

57:36.833 --> 57:38.792
But it is difficult
to say them out loud.

57:38.958 --> 57:41.184
That's exactly why they think
they can treat us like this.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.208
Because we all sit quietly
and never

57:43.375 --> 57:45.000
say anything
- actually,

57:45.167 --> 57:46.967
we are stupid
if we let them get away with it.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.417
In Italy, people go on strike

57:52.583 --> 57:53.708
when they want something.

57:57.625 --> 57:59.875
Just imagine what it would be like.

58:00.042 --> 58:01.917
All the women in the village on strike.

58:04.792 --> 58:07.000
None of you would dare anyway.

58:43.500 --> 58:45.167
<i>Women demand
completely equal rights</i>

58:45.333 --> 58:47.833
<i>down with the patriarchy</i>

58:49.458 --> 58:50.458
what is it like

58:50.625 --> 58:52.875
to be married
to a women's libber?

58:53.583 --> 58:55.000
Do you do the housework now?

58:56.917 --> 58:58.559
Does your wife send you
to the laundry room,

58:58.583 --> 59:00.663
when you come home from work?
Or something like that?

59:01.875 --> 59:04.542
Hans folds up his pants

59:05.292 --> 59:07.292
or he hoovers the living room!

59:07.583 --> 59:10.042
Careful, or you'll end up gay,
with all this woman's work.

59:11.708 --> 59:12.792
But

59:13.042 --> 59:15.917
if my old woman was like that,
I'd make sure I gave her a

59:16.083 --> 59:17.125
good seeing-to.

59:26.208 --> 59:28.167
<i>Dear hans, we women</i>

59:28.333 --> 59:30.208
<i>have decided to go on strike.</i>

59:30.417 --> 59:32.208
<i>And I am not coming home.</i>

59:33.167 --> 59:35.625
<i>There is leftover casserole
in the fridge for dinner.</i>

59:36.750 --> 59:40.208
<i>If you</i> need to <i>do</i> the washing,
please separate the lights and the darks.

59:40.750 --> 59:43.542
<i>Not too hot for the darks.
Different washing powder.</i>

59:44.167 --> 59:47.208
<i>Max needs to clean his teeth.
Watch him!</i>

59:47.667 --> 59:50.292
<i>Father-in-law
mustn't forget his pills.</i>

59:50.875 --> 59:51.958
<i>Nora.</i>

59:54.750 --> 59:57.958
<i>Women on strike</i>

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:00.750
I never thought
so many people would come.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:03.708
So we are not alone.

01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:07.292
No, we are not.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.375
That wasn't the
kitchen cupboard, was it?

01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:24.000
We haven't been happy
for a long time.

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:27.167
Since Werner had to
take over the farm,

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.533
he has been sinking deeper
and deeper into a black hole.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:33.205
I hoped it would get better, when
father-in-law wasn't living with us anymore.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.625
The two of them fought
tooth and nail.

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:38.208
Every day-

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.958
but I think

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:45.125
Werner is deeply unhappy
as a farmer.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:52.375
Did I ever tell you we used
to dream about emigrating to Canada?

01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:57.500
Back then, we had even
made plans.

01:02:00.792 --> 01:02:02.792
Really, he could do
with some help.

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:05.417
But nobody is
allowed to say that.

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:16.375
You have no idea
how much strength it gives me

01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:18.375
to be involved in this thing.

01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:42.292
What's wrong?

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:43.708
Daddy, can you

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.167
only cook eggs?

01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:48.250
Don't be so cheeky, boy.

01:02:48.417 --> 01:02:50.000
When I was a child,

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.728
we had nothing but potatoes every day.

01:02:57.417 --> 01:03:00.125
I want mummy to come home.

01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:02.583
Don't start crying.
You're not a girl.

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:07.208
I would never have let
my wife get away with this.

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:12.323
You'll see, as soon as they
start missing their children,

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.958
they'll come running home.

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:18.208
Eat!

01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:25.738
You didn't have to come
for that.

01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:27.042
I don't take them anyway.

01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:28.768
Why didn't you say
that you weren't coming home again?

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:31.375
Why? I only get in the way.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:32.875
You just cannot do right by her.

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.549
- Have a glass of wine with us, magda?
- No thanks.

01:03:39.792 --> 01:03:40.875
Sugo

01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:43.750
what you are doing
cannot be good for business.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.625
We women need
to stick together, basta!

01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:47.792
How long will

01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:48.875
the strike last?

01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:52.458
- Until the Sunday of the vote.
- We are taking a stand.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:53.917
- Oh, a stand
- my daughter

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:56.625
believes she hit the jackpot
with her husband.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.458
Did you know that magda

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:00.625
studied law?

01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:02.583
Really? Law?

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.000
But then she met a doctor

01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:06.667
and gave it all up for him.

01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:09.583
A woman who studied
was too much for the ego

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.208
of the esteemed medic.

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:13.208
You can't talk, mother.

01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:14.625
You never said anything

01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:16.250
to father either.

01:04:16.667 --> 01:04:19.347
You put up with everything.
And now you start with all the big talk.

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:22.542
Unlike you, I never studied. And you are
still making the same mistakes as me.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:25.208
At least I'm not standing around
in a stinky bar

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:26.935
with nothing to show for it in the end.

01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:28.763
You don't know what
will happen in the end.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:30.091
Try some

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:33.145
it's my grandma's recipe.

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.910
- Lots of garlic good.
- Garlic?

01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:37.552
No, no garlic.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.417
- No?
- No.

01:04:42.333 --> 01:04:43.333
Ok, I'm going now.

01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:45.458
Why don't you join us?

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.458
And sleep with these women
in the attic? No, thanks!

01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:49.875
I have

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:51.042
a spare room too.

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.333
If the doctor's wife went on strike,

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:55.708
it would make a big impression.

01:04:57.125 --> 01:04:59.750
No, absolutely not!

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:03.958
- Cheers, girls!
- Cheers!

01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:15.208
My god, that is almost as good as

01:05:15.625 --> 01:05:16.833
you know what I mean.

01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:18.917
- Mother!
- Although ruedi was

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.917
a scumbag, that side of things

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.792
always worked wonderfully for us.

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:24.768
- I don't want to know!
- There are different rules

01:05:24.792 --> 01:05:26.667
in the bedroom and in business.

01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:28.083
What do you mean?

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.167
A woman can be the boss by day

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.417
and a gentle bunny by night.

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:34.792
The two things have nothing
to do with one another.

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:36.692
I wouldn't mind being
a bunny again.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.500
Werner has not

01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:42.042
touched me for a long time.
Not even a cuddle.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:44.250
But you have

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:46.833
two hands and a pussycat
to love.

01:05:48.417 --> 01:05:49.583
And you, Nora?

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:51.458
Have you always been good,

01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:54.083
since you got married?
- Yes.

01:05:54.833 --> 01:05:56.917
Hans is the love of my life.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.375
But

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.542
sadly, he doesn't really know

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:07.708
so.. I've never
I've never had a

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:12.833
it just doesn't work for me.

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:18.292
Never at all?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.958
That's what I just said.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:21.458
But you don't just

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.101
leave it to the man.
You don't just lie back

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:24.333
and it happens.

01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:26.292
You need to do something
yourself too.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.500
What about by yourself

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:32.500
I mean, when you do it yourself
does it work then?

01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:34.125
Myself?

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:39.875
Yes, so I haven't really done it

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:41.750
very often

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.792
you see, that's the problem!

01:06:46.042 --> 01:06:48.042
She needs more practice.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:49.448
Maybe she's not doing it right.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.042
Nora do you even know now

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.250
where everything is?

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.417
- Yes.
- So, practise,

01:06:55.583 --> 01:06:58.625
practise, practise.
And don't give up too soon.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.917
What did we learn in Zurich?

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.792
Love your vagina.

01:08:23.792 --> 01:08:26.250
Luki, can you open the door?

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:43.625
- You need to speak to your wife.
- They need to stop the strike.

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:45.625
Speak to your own wives.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.542
But yours started it.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.272
I'm not happy with everything either,

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.809
but I'm not just going to leave
her with the children because of it.

01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:53.375
Mine has never complained,

01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:55.167
and suddenly nothing is right.

01:08:56.667 --> 01:08:59.582
As I said, you need
to sort it out with your own wives.

01:09:00.457 --> 01:09:01.875
If this doesn't stop,

01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:04.292
we will have to take action.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:17.542
<i>Women on strike</i>

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.250
I'd like to talk to my wife.

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:36.947
She doesn't want to talk to you.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:39.542
Leave it, vreni.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:45.582
We'll be fine.

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.082
Can we talk alone?

01:09:57.833 --> 01:10:00.240
Nora, you're not getting
anywhere with the strike.

01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:01.265
On the contrary

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:04.083
the men need to notice
that something has to change.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:07.125
But it won't work as a full-on
knee-jerk reaction.

01:10:07.292 --> 01:10:09.018
But it won't work
peacefully and patiently either.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:10.833
Who helped you
discover your tiger?

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.500
I did!

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:19.542
And you've really

01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:20.833
never ...?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I...

01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:27.083
We need to practice.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.500
I want you to come home.

01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:42.917
There is something brewing
and I'm worried.

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:46.458
We are striking until
the day of the vote.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:49.000
But I asked so nicely

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:54.167
then stay with
your stupid women.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:31.750
- Hey!
- What's going on?

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:38.250
- You're coming back home.
- Home. Now. Come on!

01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:40.917
- Are you nuts?
- Come on now!

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:42.125
Let go of her!

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:44.875
- What is this?
- Let's go. Pack your stuff up.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:46.500
No, leave her alone!

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:50.125
- No!
- What's going on?

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:54.000
Dammit!

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:55.208
Scumbags!

01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:58.583
Miserable scumbags!

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.667
Miserable bloody

01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:02.042
scumbags!

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.250
These

01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:07.167
vreni!

01:12:07.333 --> 01:12:10.500
- Vreni?
- Vreni! Vreni, what's wrong?

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:14.542
Quick, call an ambulance!
Can you hear me?

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.542
- Please get magda.
- Put a pillow under her head.

01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:20.583
Vreni? Can you hear us?

01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:03.958
I'm not going back to the farm.

01:14:09.792 --> 01:14:11.625
I have to get Hanna
out of prison.

01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:13.417
Maybe magda can help me.

01:14:16.042 --> 01:14:17.458
And where will you go?

01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:21.500
To start with, to St. gallen
to stay with my cousin.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.375
And you?

01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:29.542
I'm going home.

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:38.667
Graziella here?

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:41.875
I am

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.167
suo marito. Her husband.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:47.958
- In the kitchen.
- Thank you.

01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:07.333
Goodnight.

01:16:34.292 --> 01:16:37.542
Invitation to interview

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:35.750
<i>That the significance
of the differences between the sexes</i>

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:38.458
<i>is great</i>

01:17:39.125 --> 01:17:41.167
<i>and that women should</i>

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:43.875
<i>therefore not be given</i>

01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:45.667
<i>the right to vote.</i>

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:50.500
Irrespective of the fact
that we are convinced

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.667
<i>that the majority of women</i>

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:54.917
<i>in our country</i>

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:57.125
<i>simply do not want</i>

01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:59.500
<i>the right to vote.
- Goodnight.</i>

01:17:59.667 --> 01:18:01.000
<i>Words spoken</i>

01:18:01.167 --> 01:18:04.247
<i>by the president of the Swiss campaign
against the white paper on women voting</i>

01:18:04.667 --> 01:18:07.458
<i>at a gathering
against the proposal.</i>

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.542
<i>The propaganda from
opponents to women's rights to vote</i>

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:36.542
It's what you wanted.
A holiday.

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:38.583
You and me.
Like before we got married.

01:18:42.292 --> 01:18:43.292
Thank you.

01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:48.542
Hans."

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:51.500
I got that job.

01:18:58.417 --> 01:18:59.417
But I told you

01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:00.500
I didn't want you to.

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:02.708
And what

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:04.125
if it is what I want?

01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:07.875
I'm really trying.
We're even going to the cote d'azur.

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:10.750
I don't want to go to the cote d'azur.
I want to work.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.250
And what does that mean?

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.917
Is that more important to you
than our family?

01:19:19.542 --> 01:19:21.833
And are you not
thinking about our children?

01:19:22.042 --> 01:19:23.042
I am!

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.820
But what good is it to the boys
if their mother is unhappy?

01:19:29.417 --> 01:19:30.417
Unhappy?

01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:38.042
Then let's get divorced.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:40.167
Have you really thought this through?

01:20:20.042 --> 01:20:21.042
Graziella

01:20:21.792 --> 01:20:23.333
Nora, darling!

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:28.833
Can I stay here?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.042
Of course.

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.167
My husband and I

01:20:40.167 --> 01:20:41.542
he wants a separation.

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.500
Maybe he just needs
a little time.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.125
You are not divorced.

01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:00.958
I wanted to

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:04.458
but it is

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:05.625
complicated.

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:09.958
He says he can't
live without me.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:11.542
And you?

01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:18.708
I don't want to
grow old alone, Nora.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.042
And how can I

01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:22.542
find a man here?

01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:33.625
Werner?

01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:48.583
Werner!

01:22:48.958 --> 01:22:50.292
Dammit!

01:22:51.708 --> 01:22:52.708
Werner?

01:22:54.958 --> 01:22:56.125
Come on, get up.

01:22:57.208 --> 01:22:58.208
Shove off.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:59.250
Leave me alone.

01:23:01.792 --> 01:23:03.917
Come on. Get up.
Up.

01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:08.417
Calm down!

01:23:10.708 --> 01:23:11.708
I can't go on!

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:43.042
Calm down.

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.583
And? How are things on the farm?

01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:05.542
He can manage on his own.

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:08.917
There was never much help anyway.

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:12.792
The idiot couldn't even find himself
a decent wife. Nor could you!

01:24:12.958 --> 01:24:14.625
Shut up, father!

01:24:14.792 --> 01:24:16.458
Or I'll send you to
an old people's home.

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:17.875
So, in

01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:19.542
my day
- your day is gone.

01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:20.875
And that's good!

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:25.083
And, in future, you can
get your own beer out of the fridge.

01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:53.125
Mummy!

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.875
Dearly beloved,

01:25:10.042 --> 01:25:11.417
family of the deceased.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:14.083
We are gathered here today,

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:17.000
to bid farewell
to the bear-vreni.

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:20.167
We all knew her
as the good soul of the village.

01:25:20.375 --> 01:25:22.833
She was hardworking and
persevering.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.708
And, above all, she was modest.

01:25:24.958 --> 01:25:27.125
She never complained.

01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:29.750
From morning to night,
she helped her husband

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.292
keep all the pub-goers

01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:33.583
happy-

01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:36.667
she knew what it meant to "serve"

01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:39.667
and when her beloved husband died

01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:41.500
and the bear closed,

01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:43.208
she too could take

01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:44.583
a well-earned

01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:45.750
rest.

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:47.667
Finally, she had the time

01:25:47.833 --> 01:25:50.708
to devote to her family

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.667
and especially her grandchildren.

01:25:53.917 --> 01:25:56.375
Vreni was a happy,

01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:58.500
content person

01:25:58.917 --> 01:26:01.417
because throughout her life
she knew exactly

01:26:01.583 --> 01:26:02.958
where she belonged.

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:05.542
Where her place was

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.583
in god's plan.

01:26:11.417 --> 01:26:12.417
Fellow mourners

01:26:18.292 --> 01:26:21.583
We all know
that the bear was her home.

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.208
And that she was really
passionate about running the pub.

01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:28.667
We all also know, that bear
didn't simply have to close.

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:31.875
It closed because
her husband ran it badly

01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:34.792
and squandered all the money.

01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:36.917
And vreni could not
do anything about it,

01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:39.125
because money is men's business.

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:43.583
Vreni lost the bear, her home,

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:47.375
because she was a woman,

01:26:47.542 --> 01:26:48.708
not a man.

01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:52.250
Why should that
be whitewashed here today?

01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:57.500
Because it's so crystal clear
how blatantly unfair that is!

01:27:03.458 --> 01:27:06.917
I believe god's plan
sees us all as people.

01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:11.292
All different
but still the same.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
None better and none worse.

01:27:14.167 --> 01:27:15.458
Men and women.

01:27:17.042 --> 01:27:18.458
Yes, I believe that.

01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:22.167
And in her last few weeks,

01:27:22.333 --> 01:27:24.333
vreni fought for exactly that.

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:27.292
Freedom and justice.

01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:29.750
And we should

01:27:29.792 --> 01:27:31.083
remember that today.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.792
That is all.

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:54.792
<i>Bern.</i>

01:28:55.417 --> 01:28:56.792
In the 224th

01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:58.958
<i>Swiss referendum,</i>

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:02.625
<i>the people and</i> state <i>agreed</i> to <i>the
introduction of women's right</i> to vote.

01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:53.208
<i>A minor miracle!</i>

01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:57.292
<i>Women's right to vote was
even agreed in our village.</i>

01:29:57.667 --> 01:29:59.292
<i>It was very close.</i>

01:30:00.583 --> 01:30:03.000
<i>And then, a few months later,</i>

01:30:03.167 --> 01:30:05.917
<i>hans and I a few months later,
for the very first time.</i>

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:32.875
For you, vreni.

01:30:42.042 --> 01:30:44.125
<i>Therese did not go
back to Werner.</i>

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.958
With magda's help,

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:49.208
<i>she managed to get Hanna
out of prison.</i>

01:31:08.667 --> 01:31:10.792
<i>Werner sold the farm.</i>

01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:14.625
<i>For him, it was the first step
towards being happier again.</i>

01:31:18.208 --> 01:31:20.208
<i>And graziella noticed
that sometimes</i>

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:22.292
<i>being in a couple can be lonelier</i>
