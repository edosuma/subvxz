(male #1) Dave! Callie! Hey!

00:19.645 --> 00:21.067
'What's going on in there?
You guys okay?'

00:24.149 --> 00:25.571
(male #1) 'Dave, Callie,
what's happening?'

00:25.776 --> 00:27.244
'Quit messing around!'

00:27.444 --> 00:28.787
'Come on, guys,
what's going on?'

[gasping]

01:25.419 --> 01:26.966
Please.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.468
No more.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.549
[screams]

01:32.342 --> 01:34.720
[theme music]

01:57.868 --> 01:59.836
[siren wailing]

02:06.376 --> 02:07.593
Just breathe deeply, baby.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.341
Your grandma's gonna
be here real soon.

02:09.545 --> 02:10.798
Hey, Sullivan.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.178
Sergeant wants you
back at your post.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.055
Emily and I are having a visit.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.476
You don't wanna make
the sergeant wait.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.099
I'll take that chance.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.272
Easy, Sullivan, I'm just trying
to save you a reprimand.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.769
Excuse me, baby.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.652
That girl just lost her parents.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.359
Yeah, and social services
is on its way.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.240
(Sullivan)
'I'm done listening to you.'

02:32.444 --> 02:33.741
I said enough!

02:35.113 --> 02:36.114
(male #2) 'Shots fired!'

02:36.323 --> 02:37.825
What was that?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.956
It's okay, he didn't
do anything.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.632
It's okay. I'm sorry.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.553
It's okay. Come on, let's go.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.506
[alarm beeping] Hey, hey. Get up, get up.
You got to get up right now.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.182
Get up! Wake up.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.976
- You got to go right now.
- Good morning, sunshine.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.177
Oh, wait a minute, W-what is it?

02:57.386 --> 02:59.263
It's, uh, it's Nora.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.688
- Right.
- Uh, yeah.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.106
It's time to go.
Here's your tie.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.934
- Get up.
- Or we could just stay in.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.860
I cook a wicked breakfast.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.359
Bacon, eggs, sausage,
beans, tomatoes.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.115
Perfect islands
in a sea of grease.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.237
No, um, my boyfriend
just called.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.988
He's gonna be here any minute.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.570
You didn't tell me last night
you had a boyfriend.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.530
Yeah, I did, get up,
come on, get your stuff.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.206
I'll set the table
for three, then.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.250
- 'Hey, Nora, you up?'
- He said "Nora." I was right.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.794
- 'Get your ass out of bed!'
- Yeah. Go.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.253
[Pounding on door]

03:29.584 --> 03:32.178
(Nora) 'Oh, hi, honey. I-l
was just in the bathroom.'

03:33.755 --> 03:36.133
(Chas)
'Okay, Zed's in our class.'

03:36.341 --> 03:37.558
'You're my problem today.'

03:37.759 --> 03:39.807
So, where do you want to start?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.729
Back in bed.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.231
Just being honest.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.523
Chas, I know what I need to do

03:47.728 --> 03:49.230
and I'll get it sorted, alright?

03:49.438 --> 03:51.281
As soon as you go home.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.282
I'm not going anywhere.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.325
Fine.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.830
Let's see.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.004
Birmingham..

04:07.205 --> 04:09.173
That's like what,
two hours away?

04:10.876 --> 04:13.800
Well.. We'll be there by lunch.

04:16.630 --> 04:22.103
# Until you're ready I'll be
prayin' for what I know #

04:27.684 --> 04:29.903
Looks like we're
late to the party.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.150
Local police blotter reported

04:31.354 --> 04:32.981
a double homicide last night.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.237
Man and his wife.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.239
Battered beyond recognition.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.410
Bite marks?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.578
Puncture wounds?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.951
Flesh torn asunder?

04:40.155 --> 04:42.078
No details in the report.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
They had a young daughter.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.085
Untouched in the attack.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.458
We'll start by figuring out
why she was spared.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.790
I'm breaking in,
you stand watch.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.875
I-If I need you I shall give
you a little whistle

04:52.083 --> 04:54.211
that suddenly chokes
into silence.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.674
[glass shatters]

05:01.009 --> 05:01.931
[sniffs]

05:03.386 --> 05:04.729
[sniffs]

05:18.151 --> 05:19.494
[sniffs]

05:27.160 --> 05:28.537
[startled gasp] Oh, sh...!

05:31.915 --> 05:33.167
You know, I've never
punched an angel

05:33.375 --> 05:34.627
but you are begging
for it, mate.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.633
I could announce my
arrival with trumpets.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.680
Used to have a tight horn
section back in the day.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.054
Mm, I'm sure you did.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.229
Smells of burning,
but there's no sign of fire.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.930
Some serious telekinetic energy

05:47.138 --> 05:49.015
was spent here last night.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.977
- What is it you want?
- Battle plans, John.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.983
- Time to draw 'em up.
- Battle plans, eh?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.234
You know bugger-all

05:55.438 --> 05:57.406
about what we're up against.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.609
I know there's a darkness
rising, John.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.820
It's ancient beyond measure.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.247
You're going to stem
the tide of its attacks.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.245
[chuckles]

06:06.449 --> 06:07.792
And, uh..

06:07.993 --> 06:10.212
What makes me so special?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.088
Nothing that I'm aware of.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.838
St. Peter. Ignatius of Antioch.
Joan of Arc.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.135
- Oh, John, they were special.
- Mmm.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.760
You're more
of a... desperation move.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.308
Story of my life, mate.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.885
Well, as long as you're here

06:25.093 --> 06:26.720
might as well
make yourself useful.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.228
Why was that girl
spared from the attack?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.564
I can't tell you that.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.070
Well, you're a divine messenger

06:35.270 --> 06:36.988
with an omnipotent boss.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.405
Don't be stingy.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.905
When humanity was granted
free will

06:41.109 --> 06:42.281
angels lost the power

06:42.485 --> 06:44.658
to directly influence
events on earth.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.115
That's just
the kind of double-talk

06:46.323 --> 06:48.951
I expect from your type.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.503
The broken coffee mug
pieces are on the floor

06:51.703 --> 06:55.253
but the coffee stains are on
the counter. Doesn't add up.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.587
Would it make you feel
better if I told you

06:56.791 --> 06:58.714
you were getting warm?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.263
I need to see
what happened here.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.056
The rules have changed, John.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.384
'The things you're used to
dealing with have more power'.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.094
They move faster. Hunger deeper.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.304
Your old ways might not work.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.809
Be open.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.391
Step aside, sunshine.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.862
Ximbatik kaajal.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.032
Ak bin-ka-aak-abtal.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
Mayan.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.907
Impressive.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.954
[dramatic music]

07:45.340 --> 07:47.889
She was possessed
by the spirit of a child.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.219
'The daughter survived
the attacks'

07:49.427 --> 07:51.020
because she was the attacker.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.565
That entity inside her,
it was controlling her.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.563
'Now, that it's loose'

07:55.767 --> 07:58.065
'it'll be looking
for a new child to possess.'

07:58.269 --> 08:00.818
[siren wailing]

08:04.359 --> 08:06.032
[boy screaming]

08:07.654 --> 08:09.201
[panting]

08:09.406 --> 08:11.249
- What's going on?
- There's someone in my room.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.457
Again?

08:14.661 --> 08:15.913
Come here, sweetie.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.919
You're just fine.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.046
There's no one here.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.054
Or here.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.804
Oh. I know.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.931
He's in the closet, right?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.313
It's just a closet, Henry.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.519
Hey. This happens at Halloween.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.150
Your imagination runs wild.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.072
Remember last year you didn't
want to trick-or-treat

08:43.273 --> 08:44.900
'cause you were afraid
of the monsters?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.451
Yeah.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.618
Don't worry.

08:47.819 --> 08:51.039
- I handled that.
- Darrell!

08:51.239 --> 08:53.116
There's a whole costume
that comes with this.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.952
You wear that and the kids will
be scared of you. I promise.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.879
You honestly think
this is helpful?

08:58.079 --> 09:01.379
Honestly? Henry's a strong kid
if we just let him be.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.674
Hey..

09:05.879 --> 09:08.473
You are strong,
you know that, buddy.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.596
But you need to believe it.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.558
You're just fine, sweetie pie.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.769
Now, try and go back
to sleep, honey.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.274
Have sweet dreams.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.737
[intense music]

[Henry gasping]

10:10.485 --> 10:12.112
[closet door creaking]

10:28.962 --> 10:30.714
[grunts]

10:38.763 --> 10:40.640
[aquarium filter bubbling]

10:44.185 --> 10:45.528
[intense music]

10:54.529 --> 10:56.202
No.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.917
[screaming]

11:04.747 --> 11:06.294
[Henry screaming]

11:12.297 --> 11:14.140
- Is everything alright?
- I'm sorry.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.138
I don't know why I screamed.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.845
You can go back to bed now.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.389
Really?

11:23.433 --> 11:26.107
I'm feeling much better.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.939
You'll see.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.070
[rock music]

11:38.364 --> 11:39.911
You know, I could lose
my paralegal license

11:40.116 --> 11:41.493
meeting you here like this.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.080
But I owe you, honey.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.585
I sweet-talked this

11:46.789 --> 11:49.212
from a guy in child services.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.294
Cute, but clingy.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.675
'Here's your girl.
Emily Cooper.'

11:53.880 --> 11:55.507
Any chance I can get
close to her?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.058
She's untouchable.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.805
Not only is she under
psychological care

11:59.010 --> 12:00.808
but she's in protective custody.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.310
Why? The coppers can't
possibly have a suspect.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.142
No, but there's been a series
of killings like this

12:06.351 --> 12:07.944
across the southeast.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.487
Dead parents, beaten to a pulp?

12:09.687 --> 12:10.984
They all had one child.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.862
The children all survived
the attacks.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.989
Cases were never connected
because of the time

12:15.193 --> 12:17.070
between the killings.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.578
First one on record,
35 years ago.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.787
One after that..

12:21.991 --> 12:23.743
16 years later.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.795
Then 18 years.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.713
Now, three..

12:27.914 --> 12:29.382
In the last month.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.209
That's when the cops
smartened up.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.011
These children, have they
got anything in common?

12:34.212 --> 12:36.886
What, you mean, like horns
growing out of their heads?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.184
No, but they did start

12:39.384 --> 12:41.637
throwing fits days
before the killings.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.768
Just angry outbursts
at home, at school.

12:44.973 --> 12:45.974
I suspect
that's because they had

12:46.182 --> 12:48.901
a malevolent spirit inside them.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.820
You mean like my Roger?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.231
No, luv.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.736
Your clearly departed husband

12:54.941 --> 12:55.863
wasn't inhabiting bodies.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.444
He was just pissing and moaning

12:57.652 --> 12:58.995
about being dead.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.073
Well, it is a lot
quieter around my house

13:02.282 --> 13:04.580
since you helped him cross over.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.912
I need to find out who this
spirit was when it was alive.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.918
Sometimes they can forget
who they are

13:09.122 --> 13:11.341
and just naming them
releases them from our world.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.589
I wonder if any of these
survivors remembers the name

13:13.793 --> 13:14.885
of the soul that possessed them.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.053
Well, you won't get
near the kids

13:16.254 --> 13:17.927
from the recent cases but..

13:18.131 --> 13:21.135
One of the early survivors
lives nearby.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.219
Marcello Panneti.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.601
He'd be in his 40s
now, I suppose.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.182
Where can I find him?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.939
Local mental hospital.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.440
Perfect.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.738
I'll feel right at home.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.656
[intense music]

13:38.776 --> 13:42.406
Marcello introduced his
daddy's head to an axe.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.206
Mommy's head went
into the thresher.

13:44.407 --> 13:47.502
At least they... think
it was her head.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.955
So I'm not surprised
nobody comes to visit him.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.836
Especially not his..

13:52.040 --> 13:53.838
Family.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.966
Ten years old, dismantled
two fully grown adults.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.217
Bit unlikely, don't you think?

13:58.421 --> 14:00.173
Oh, no. Kids are sponges.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.473
They soak up whatever
you give 'em.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.302
And Marcello, well..

14:04.510 --> 14:05.432
'His handiwork with an axe'

14:05.636 --> 14:07.604
is something of a family
tradition.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.648
Rumor is there's
a bloody tree stump

14:09.849 --> 14:11.522
outside the farmhouse
where he grew up.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.228
Whenever Marcello misbehaved

14:13.436 --> 14:15.814
his punishment was..

14:16.022 --> 14:16.898
Severe.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.415
Ah.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.587
It's beautiful this time
a year, isn't?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.385
Not one for a wee natter.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.974
Then you're my kind of bloke.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.676
But I'm trying to prevent
someone from going

14:44.884 --> 14:47.854
through the same experience
that you did as a kid.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.649
Bloody hell.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.780
[dramatic music]

15:13.621 --> 15:15.965
[clattering]

15:18.418 --> 15:20.216
Hello?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.477
Henry?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.269
[door creaking]

16:01.836 --> 16:03.463
Who's there?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.320
[tapping]

16:27.195 --> 16:28.947
[taps echoing]

16:32.867 --> 16:34.744
[switch clicking]

17:05.066 --> 17:06.909
Aah, aah! Oh.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.577
[groans]

17:08.778 --> 17:10.371
Did you do this, Henry?

17:10.570 --> 17:11.492
No.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.118
I just walked in.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.746
I heard noises out here.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.544
Yeah, same here.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.247
I think somebody
was in the house.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.877
[groaning]

17:22.083 --> 17:24.006
I'm gonna go back
to my room now.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.757
- Hey, dad?
- What?

17:26.796 --> 17:28.218
Be careful.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.146
(Constantine) 'Marcello was
useless, the poor bastard.'

17:43.354 --> 17:44.571
'Fully catatonic.'

17:44.772 --> 17:47.025
You know, most people
who survive a possession..

17:47.233 --> 17:49.406
They're downright chatty
about the ordeal.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.862
Tough break for him.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.868
Not entirely.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.995
His parents got what
they deserved.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.872
But we have to stop
this evil entity, mate.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.420
It's a bloody serial killer
through the ages.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.837
Well, if it's been around
for that long

18:01.038 --> 18:03.132
maybe we can track down
another living survivor.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.630
No time to mess with that.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.554
With the rising darkness
we got to stop this thing

18:08.754 --> 18:10.176
before it has a mind
to kill again.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.349
[dramatic music]

18:13.467 --> 18:15.060
Take a look at this.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.308
What kind of map is that?

18:16.512 --> 18:17.684
These are ley lines.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.014
Mystical track ways flowing

18:19.223 --> 18:21.942
with electromagnetic energy.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.647
These X's mark the home
address of every victim

18:25.855 --> 18:28.028
whose parents were slaughtered.

18:29.734 --> 18:30.735
They all fall on the same line.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.035
Yeah.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.659
Ley lines are
a psychic railroad.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.741
Easy for a child's
soul to travel.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.828
To find the next victim,
we just..

18:40.036 --> 18:40.878
Follow the line.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.830
Follow..

18:43.039 --> 18:44.336
'...the line.'

18:55.718 --> 18:57.937
[barking fiercely]

19:10.900 --> 19:12.493
[creaking]

19:16.697 --> 19:17.698
[whimpering]

19:26.207 --> 19:28.084
We know which ley lines
the spirits are following.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.589
Now we just need something

19:29.794 --> 19:31.922
to detect the malignant thing.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.428
- What's this do?
- Oh, put that down.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.055
That can't help us.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.603
That's not what I asked.
I asked you what it does.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.774
But you're too self-involved
to hear me, like always.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.022
Like Renee. She's gone.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.938
I'm afraid I wasn't enough
to keep her from leaving.

19:49.146 --> 19:49.988
Can't bring myself to tell
you about it, though.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.031
Not that you'd hear me...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.613
This is the Sword of Night.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.493
It compels the holder
to speak the truth.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.996
Oh.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.453
Is there anything you..

20:03.661 --> 20:04.833
Want to talk about, or...

20:05.037 --> 20:06.289
No, no.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.544
Well, you got to hand
it to Jasper.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.342
This old mill's
a treasure trove, eh?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.795
Yes!

20:12.837 --> 20:17.058
There she is.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.430
What is it?

20:18.634 --> 20:20.056
Oh, there's no time
for explanations.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.308
You'll see.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.684
Right..

20:22.888 --> 20:25.812
Now, all I need
is some frankincense.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.026
[crow cawing]

20:36.527 --> 20:38.529
Let these cool.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.366
They'll make a good
snack while we work.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.042
What are they?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.289
Your favorite.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.836
Pumpkin seeds.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.540
Oh, markers.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.045
I'll be right back.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.519
Got 'em.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.522
[dramatic music]

21:09.268 --> 21:11.441
Henry, what did you do?

21:11.645 --> 21:14.398
Carved the pumpkins.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.609
You know you're not allowed
to pick up knives.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.945
- Give me that.
- I'm not done carving.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.991
Henry, hand me the knife.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.294
[intense music]

21:30.790 --> 21:32.133
Now.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.679
I'll put this inside.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.721
[crow cawing]

21:44.261 --> 21:45.387
[crow cawing]

21:45.596 --> 21:46.893
[shrieks]

21:56.690 --> 21:58.033
How long do we got
to do this for?

21:58.234 --> 22:00.737
We walk until
the frankincense directs us.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.243
According to Jasper's maps, the
ley line continues on this road

22:03.447 --> 22:05.575
for a quarter mile
and then we veer right.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.626
Whoa, stop.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.999
Look.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.458
Wrong way, mate.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.919
Frankincense flees the
presence of malevolent energy.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.005
What we want... is behind you.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.020
So... now what?
We knock on the door?

22:26.220 --> 22:27.472
No, that never works.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.273
Why not?

22:29.473 --> 22:31.851
Oh, hello, we tracked an
evil spirit to your house.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.482
It might be inside your kid.
Do you mind if we take a look?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.030
- Yeah, that won't work.
- No.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.324
Our best bet is
to hunker down for the night.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.118
We wait, watch and listen
for an attack.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.331
[intense music]

23:08.679 --> 23:10.022
[grunts]

23:10.222 --> 23:11.940
I didn't do nothing.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.235
Hey, hey, teach?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.573
You got a couple of kids
getting shirty over there.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.985
- What's in that trench coat?
- I am.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.286
Now, go and stop that row, will
you, before someone gets hurt.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.660
You got a kid at this school?

23:27.865 --> 23:29.492
No, I don't got a kid
at this school.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.247
Will you just turn around?

23:31.410 --> 23:34.584
You're just a little baby.
Want your mommy?

23:34.747 --> 23:37.671
'You're just a little punk.
Get up.'

23:37.875 --> 23:39.172
Huh.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.177
[yelling]

23:44.381 --> 23:45.758
[thudding]

23:45.966 --> 23:48.139
[children screaming]

23:52.473 --> 23:53.770
Bollocks!

23:58.228 --> 24:02.153
That boy came into my hospital
with a fractured skull.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.905
What did you do to him?

24:04.109 --> 24:05.361
(Darrell) 'Were you
defending yourself, buddy?'

24:05.569 --> 24:06.536
Don't "Buddy" him.

24:06.737 --> 24:07.909
There is never any reason

24:08.113 --> 24:10.787
'for anything like this
to happen, ever..'

24:10.991 --> 24:12.459
[rattling]

24:14.620 --> 24:16.463
[doorbell rings]

24:23.379 --> 24:26.053
Hello.
My name's John Constantine.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.223
I'm the new counselor
at the school.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.597
I've come to check on your son.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.055
We really do hate
sending him home like this.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.856
No. Come on in. I'm Darrell.

24:35.057 --> 24:36.730
This is my wife, Clair.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.562
We were just trying to figure
out why he acted out today.

24:39.770 --> 24:40.896
It's just not him.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.028
You are right about that, ma'am.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.282
What are you doing?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.113
[screaming]

24:49.321 --> 24:50.868
- What the hell is that?
- It's a mandrake root.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.370
Malevolent spirits
can't stand 'em.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.293
I had to show you
what you're up against.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.622
I'm an exorcist.
Your son's possessed.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.924
- We don't have much time.
- Get out!

25:00.124 --> 25:02.968
I told Chas this wouldn't work.
Look, you said so yourself.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.296
That's not your Henry.
And you're right.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.802
It's an indwelling spirit,
been murdering for decades.

25:08.007 --> 25:11.352
- And you're next in line.
- Get out!

25:11.510 --> 25:13.387
Look, you know your son best.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.644
Just keep and eye on him,
and, uh, call me

25:16.849 --> 25:19.147
if something happens.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.274
You know what?
I've got a better plan.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.525
[cell door shuts]

25:25.733 --> 25:28.486
[lock buzzes]

25:28.694 --> 25:30.662
[sighs] You didn't manage

25:30.863 --> 25:33.537
to sneak a bottle past
our friends out there, did you?

25:35.576 --> 25:37.453
[chuckling]

25:38.620 --> 25:40.793
I should be ashamed of myself.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.671
Time was, you'd be asking me
for a favor

25:42.875 --> 25:44.548
and now look at me.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.380
No bail money, no booze.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.432
It only took me, like,
six months in the loony bin

25:50.632 --> 25:53.101
to turn me
into a bloody amateur.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.054
[sighs heavily]

25:58.807 --> 26:00.775
I'm cursed
when it comes to kids.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.612
Probably on the account
that I was

26:04.813 --> 26:07.032
such a wretched
little bastard myself.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.319
(Manny) 'Wow.'

26:12.321 --> 26:14.494
You really should get therapy
for that.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.201
Piss off.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.456
You made it perfectly clear

26:18.660 --> 26:20.128
you're not allowed to help me.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.626
I said the exact opposite.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.504
What, did shock therapy
destroy your hearing?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.506
Alright, then.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.431
Go and warn mummy and daddy
about their little demon seed

26:30.631 --> 26:31.678
send it back to hell

26:31.882 --> 26:34.351
oh, and pick us up a gin
and tonic, eh?

26:34.551 --> 26:37.100
Guidance, John.
I can offer you guidance.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.056
'Oh, thank you very much.'

26:39.264 --> 26:42.768
I've made it through my life
without any help from you.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.398
'You sure about that?'

26:44.603 --> 26:45.980
How do you know
I wasn't by your side

26:46.188 --> 26:48.065
when your father burned you
with his cigarette?

26:48.273 --> 26:49.991
Or stayed you from suicide

26:50.192 --> 26:52.945
when your sister
left you alone with him?

26:54.988 --> 26:57.491
That's enough of that, you.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.373
You didn't have it easy, John.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.589
If you want to save a child

27:04.790 --> 27:07.714
just remember
what it was like to be one.

27:07.918 --> 27:11.923
Well, aren't you a regular
little clever clocks?

27:12.131 --> 27:14.850
You know what I think
of that dog's breakfast?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.052
Oh, bloody hell.
I hate it when he does that.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.478
[vomiting]

27:18.679 --> 27:19.680
Oh.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.186
Nice. Lovely.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.643
Your temper could've
gotten us killed, Darrell.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.273
You are lucky
he didn't have a gun.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.571
Wouldn't have mattered.
I knocked him flat.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.489
- 'We have a son now..'
- Stop fighting.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.987
(Darrell)
'I'm glad that he's watching.'

27:31.191 --> 27:32.363
Because he needs
a male role model.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.161
'Be a mom, fine, coddle him.'

27:34.361 --> 27:36.159
But he's gotta learn
how to handle himself in life.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.661
Oh, like he handled himself
on the playground?

27:38.866 --> 27:41.665
- 'It's an elementary school..'
- Stop fighting!

27:43.120 --> 27:44.997
[shattering and exploding]

27:53.964 --> 27:55.341
Henry?

27:58.969 --> 28:01.643
(Darrell) What happened in here?

28:01.847 --> 28:05.317
What's that burning smell?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.360
You gonna hurt me?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.106
No. No, of course not.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.191
Henry..

28:13.192 --> 28:14.569
(Darrell) Violence?

28:14.776 --> 28:17.996
This isn't the way
to express your emotions.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.870
How did you even do this?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.454
You have to clean this mess up.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.462
(guard) Rise and shine.
You got a visitor.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.005
Jerry, I told you
not to bother me

28:27.206 --> 28:29.334
unless you bring me breakfast.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.483
What did you mean when
you said my son's possessed?

28:49.186 --> 28:50.108
[siren wailing]

28:51.855 --> 28:54.028
Every one of these parents
had a little nipper

28:54.233 --> 28:57.863
that was exhibiting the exact
same behavior as Henry.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.038
What you said was true. Henry..

29:03.784 --> 29:05.752
Something's not right.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.462
Not all souls go gently
into the night.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.213
A violent death can leave behind

29:12.417 --> 29:15.136
a bewildered
or traumatized soul.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.055
Child spirits are the worst.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.975
They act out, like all brats.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.303
Only their tantrums
end in blood.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.312
Okay.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.110
I need to do something.
What can we do?

29:30.310 --> 29:31.903
If we knew who the spirit was
when it was alive

29:32.104 --> 29:33.651
we could find a way
to release it peacefully

29:33.855 --> 29:37.029
but this little bugger
could be hundreds of years old.

29:37.234 --> 29:40.033
I could try and cast it out..

29:40.237 --> 29:43.036
But forceful exorcisms
with young children..

29:43.240 --> 29:45.459
[scream echoing]

29:45.659 --> 29:47.957
What?

29:48.161 --> 29:49.583
Kids present challenges.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.586
Even if we dispelled
the spirit from Henry

29:51.790 --> 29:52.837
it would just find another host.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.418
Is there another option?

29:54.626 --> 29:55.798
I could bind it to one spot

29:56.003 --> 29:57.220
but that presents
a danger for us.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.139
And you'd have
to be part of the team.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.467
I have a friend
who can help us out..

30:01.675 --> 30:05.100
But, well, you need at least
three people to hold a seance.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.648
I will do whatever it takes
to get my son back.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.395
You did say
you were a doctor, right?

30:23.030 --> 30:24.327
Henry.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.500
You've been looking a little
under the weather lately

30:35.709 --> 30:38.303
so I brought some vitamins
home from work.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.341
- What is it?
- Just some vitamins.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.644
B-12. I give them
to you all the time.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.188
- You do?
- Yeah. Here.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.231
Just give me your arm.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.227
Stop.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.858
[distorted] Stop!

30:56.063 --> 30:57.406
Stop!

30:57.606 --> 30:59.404
[screams]

31:05.447 --> 31:07.825
[shudders]

31:15.582 --> 31:17.755
Henry's asleep on the couch.
I'll be back soon.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.802
Yeah. See you, hon.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.260
[door shuts]

31:23.256 --> 31:24.473
[crows cawing]

31:35.644 --> 31:37.863
This was a longer drive
than I expected.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.691
We only have a couple more hours
before that sedative wears off.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.402
Well, let's get to work then.
Clair, meet Chas.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.741
- Hello.
- Thanks for helping my son.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.165
Chas, take a look around back.
Make sure we're alone.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.459
- This one could get messy.
- What is this place?

31:50.659 --> 31:52.627
This is the home
of the first possession victim

31:52.828 --> 31:54.501
we could find on record.

31:54.704 --> 31:59.130
A young boy killed his mother
and father here 35 years ago.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.962
The property never sold again.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.013
[scream echoing]

32:04.214 --> 32:07.184
- Who was he?
- Marcello Panneti.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.263
Nice bloke. Doesn't say much.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.474
Now, I can't release the soul
from our world without its name

32:13.682 --> 32:16.435
but I can bind it to one place
so it can't go on killing.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.190
You want to trap it
in this house.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.321
That thing inside your son
has a powerful connection

32:23.525 --> 32:24.993
to this land.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.742
It's just the spot
for a summoning.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.676
It knows we're here.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.430
- The spirit?
- The house.

32:48.633 --> 32:52.228
Anyplace where tragedy
occurred festers with energy.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.182
You learn to sense it
after a while.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.482
[Clair screams]

32:58.226 --> 32:59.523
You Okay?

33:02.522 --> 33:03.865
[gasps]

33:05.650 --> 33:07.027
All clear.

33:14.117 --> 33:17.838
The murders happened
in this room.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.632
This is where
we'll hold the seance.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.669
Shall we then?

33:26.588 --> 33:29.888
Now, we must hold hands.
And not break contact.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.638
Not until I recite
the binding spell.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.265
Is that clear?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.222
You'll do fine.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.562
O, clever spirit of the dead

33:42.771 --> 33:45.945
invader of flesh,
traveler through time

33:46.149 --> 33:49.744
we present you offerings
from life into death

33:49.945 --> 33:52.824
and invite you into our circle.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.079
Move among us.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.206
[grunting]

33:58.995 --> 34:01.339
O, cursed spirit of the dead

34:01.540 --> 34:04.134
spiller of blood,
destroyer of families

34:04.334 --> 34:07.383
we command you into our circle.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.136
Move among us now!

34:11.174 --> 34:12.175
[gasps]

34:12.384 --> 34:14.226
Don't break the circle!

34:17.097 --> 34:18.440
[creaking]

34:20.641 --> 34:21.985
It's coming.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.902
[dramatic music]

34:40.453 --> 34:42.956
A three-legged deer?
What does that mean?

34:43.164 --> 34:46.007
It means we're wasting
our bloody time.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.929
What went wrong?

34:50.130 --> 34:51.803
Maybe Marcello
was never possessed.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.350
He killed his parents
on his own.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.722
The spirit would have
no connection to this location.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.803
No! This house
is on the ley line

34:57.012 --> 34:59.481
just like all the other places
of attack.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.230
Oh, come on, John.
What are you missing?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.027
Henry is going
to wake up any second.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.604
I'm afraid he's gonna go
after my husband.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.234
We need to get this thing
out of him.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.692
You do not want
an exorcism, Clair.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.446
Trust me.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.369
I do..

35:13.570 --> 35:15.163
Trust you.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.701
Maybe I don't trust myself.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.459
John, I need you to save my son.

35:35.175 --> 35:37.348
[children clamoring]

35:47.479 --> 35:49.857
Oh, hey, buddy.
Costume looks great.

35:50.065 --> 35:53.365
What did I tell you, little man?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.366
- Darrell.
- Where have you been?

35:55.570 --> 35:58.699
- I've been calling.
- Listen. I need to explain.

35:58.907 --> 36:00.830
- What's he doing out ofjail?
- Your wife dropped the charges.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.958
I'm here to exorcise
an evil spirit from your boy.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.755
(Darrell) 'And you're blaming me
for filling his head with ideas?'

36:05.955 --> 36:08.049
I know how it sounds crazy,
but you need to listen to him.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.592
No, I'm not listening
to you anymore!

36:09.793 --> 36:10.919
You're out of control.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.471
[indistinct chatter]

36:13.672 --> 36:15.595
Stop fighting!

36:16.841 --> 36:17.967
[groaning]

36:18.176 --> 36:20.645
- Darrell!
- Conflict.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.644
That's the trigger.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.021
[chanting in foreign language]

36:32.232 --> 36:34.781
(Clair) Henry!

36:34.984 --> 36:36.236
Henry!

36:38.279 --> 36:40.702
Hold it, kid!

36:40.907 --> 36:41.908
[groaning]

36:42.117 --> 36:43.664
[grunting]

36:45.203 --> 36:47.297
Aah! I'll be okay!
He went down the street!

36:47.497 --> 36:49.374
I'll be back for you!

36:49.582 --> 36:51.505
[intense music]

36:55.255 --> 36:57.223
Hey! You can't go in there!

36:59.759 --> 37:02.854
Hey, kids! Has any of you
seen a short zombie?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.806
Yeah, he's in there.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.767
- Hey, man! You need a ticket!
- Sorry, mate, we're closed.

37:13.898 --> 37:14.774
[evil laughter]

37:14.983 --> 37:15.859
[howling]

37:21.531 --> 37:23.283
[evil laughter]

37:24.784 --> 37:26.752
[ghostly wail]

37:26.953 --> 37:28.955
[eerie screams]

37:29.164 --> 37:30.461
[evil laughter]

37:31.583 --> 37:33.176
[ghostly wail]

37:35.795 --> 37:37.547
[man groaning]

37:40.717 --> 37:42.139
[eerie screams]

37:46.264 --> 37:48.813
[evil laughter]

37:49.017 --> 37:50.940
[electricity crackling]

37:52.103 --> 37:53.446
[man screaming]

38:05.950 --> 38:08.373
[eerie shrieking]

38:10.580 --> 38:12.173
[wry laugh]

38:21.716 --> 38:22.717
[gasps]

38:22.926 --> 38:24.303
[screaming]

38:27.597 --> 38:29.850
I wouldn't try anything
if I was you, mate.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.982
This mirror's gonna
throw it back in your face.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.438
Be a good lad now.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.648
Come home with me, yeah?

38:45.782 --> 38:48.001
[eerie shrieking]

38:58.837 --> 39:01.181
An axe.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.850
Of course.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.635
I know what you are, boy.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.938
Even if you've forgotten.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.606
Your name is Marcello.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.903
I know why you're doing this.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.026
Your parents weren't
good people, were they?

39:17.230 --> 39:22.236
Your dad, he chopped off your
fingers on a bloody tree stump!

39:22.443 --> 39:24.320
[grunting]

39:24.529 --> 39:26.452
[coughs]

39:26.656 --> 39:29.330
And what, you're gonna piss
and moan about it forever?

39:33.496 --> 39:36.841
You're not the only one who
had it rough growing up, boy.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.464
This world's dark
and full of pain.

39:39.669 --> 39:40.795
For everyone!

39:41.004 --> 39:43.348
[yelling]

39:43.548 --> 39:46.176
Only most people don't leave
a trail of dead bodies

39:46.384 --> 39:49.388
and shattered lives
in retribution!

39:49.596 --> 39:51.223
[grunts]

39:54.642 --> 39:57.612
Oh, what? You want me
to feel sorry for you?

39:57.812 --> 39:59.814
What about that poor girl
whose parents you murdered

40:00.023 --> 40:03.118
to seek your retribution, eh?

40:03.318 --> 40:05.662
You'll get no such pity
from me, boy!

40:05.862 --> 40:06.784
[grunts]

40:06.988 --> 40:09.241
[yells]

40:09.449 --> 40:11.827
Marcello Panneti!

40:12.035 --> 40:13.412
As the one who named you

40:13.620 --> 40:16.339
I bind you
to your rightful place!

40:21.794 --> 40:23.592
[eerie shrieking]

40:32.013 --> 40:34.015
[Henry gasping]

40:37.685 --> 40:39.358
Where am I?

40:42.190 --> 40:45.785
Come on.
Let's get you home, Henry.

40:48.696 --> 40:51.825
(Constantine) I thought Henry was
possessed by the soul of a dead person.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.161
But it was the soul
of a living one.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.371
Marcello was the oldest
survivor on record

40:56.579 --> 40:58.377
because he was the first killer.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.254
But the act was so traumatic

41:00.458 --> 41:04.179
that his soul fled his body
and went right on killing.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.258
A soul can't cross over
while its body is still alive.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.184
So I sent Marcello 's
to the only place I could...

41:10.385 --> 41:12.228
[yelling]

41:12.428 --> 41:15.307
At least he's locked in
a high security facility

41:15.515 --> 41:18.860
where qualified doctors
can heal his inner child.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.403
Who knows?

41:20.603 --> 41:22.776
Maybe one day
he'll even find peace.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.152
And what
of my rotten inner child?

41:27.360 --> 41:29.988
If humanity is what can save us

41:30.196 --> 41:33.245
then overcoming the damage
and weakness in my nature

41:33.449 --> 41:36.544
it may be the part of this
battle that I dread most.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.874
I don't have the answers.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.961
I only know
that a darkness is rising.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.045
And unless I can stop it

41:46.254 --> 41:49.133
the world will change forever.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.220
[theme music]
