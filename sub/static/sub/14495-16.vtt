00:06.640 --> 00:08.600
You call yourself Leader?

00:08.640 --> 00:13.520
I am the most advanced mind
the world has ever seen!

00:13.520 --> 00:19.040
I think on a level normal human
beings cannot begin to comprehend.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.840

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Jan, you sure it's necessary
to tease the prisoner like that?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.960
Yeah, pretty much.
Especially when it's Dave.

- Welcome to 42, Avengers.
- Warden.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.280
Let me give you the heads up in case
you're thinking about escaping again.

01:44.320 --> 01:47.120
<i>This prison sits in
a billion light years of empty,</i>

01:47.160 --> 01:49.200
<i>lifeless nothingness

01:49.240 --> 01:53.080

- Um, not again.
- What's going on?

02:56.960 --> 03:00.560
That, Captain America, is
exactly what I'm here to find out.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.640
Agent Quartermain.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.640
Let's talk in the control room. I
don't want to scare the prisoners.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.520
When you put it that way,
you're starting to scare me.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.200
The prisoners, especially the Leader,

03:12.240 --> 03:14.120
have been ranting about hearing noises.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.160
Something outside trying to get in.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.920
The prison doesn't have
any external scanners.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.040
We never needed them.
There wasn't anything out there.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.800
Until?

03:22.840 --> 03:26.600
We used the scanning equipment in
the Mandroid Armor and saw something.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.640
What exactly?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.640
We don't know, a few blips.
Then, they were gone.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.560
- And the power fluctuations?
- It's been happening recently.

03:33.600 --> 03:39.960
But we have triple backups in place.
The power isn't going to go off.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.920
You were saying?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.120
Emergency power online.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.920
Cell doors holding.
Prisoners contained.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.800
But, I'm detecting a severe power
disruption at junction 95.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.560
Alright, I'll go have a look.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.360
Major Danvers and I will come with you.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.840
Not that I enjoy stating the obvious,
but this ain't good.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.640
That's the primary power conduit.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.720
[Ms. Marvel] It looks...
chewed through.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.680
Could one of the
prisoners have done this?

04:14.720 --> 04:16.680
Or could something else have
followed us through the gateway?

04:16.720 --> 04:21.120
I don't think so. The prisoners are
all accounted for in their cells,

04:21.160 --> 04:24.200
and the power dampeners prevent any
of them from using their abilities.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.840
And I don't know anything on Earth
that can eat through metal like that.

04:27.880 --> 04:32.840
Besides, whatever caused this
was digging its way in... not out.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.720
If something came in
this way, we would see it.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.640
- The only way out...
- Is the way we came in.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.400
[man screams]

04:48.960 --> 04:49.960
What is it?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000

Something's in here.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.600
What happened, soldier?

05:23.640 --> 05:27.600
A bug. Some horrible alien bug.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.440
- We are familiar with it.
- That's an understatement.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.360
- Where's the Warden?
- It took him. Dragged him away.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.160
I can get surveillance online.
The controls on the gateway are shot.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.040
We have no communication
with the Baxter Building,

05:40.080 --> 05:41.800
and we can't open the
gate from this side.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.800
How do we get back?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.600
We'll have to wait for the gateway
to open from the other side.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.360
And when will that happen?

05:48.400 --> 05:52.520
When the next shift of
guards reports for duty.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.320
There!
The mess hall!

05:57.080 --> 05:59.080
<i>[Ms. Marvel] What's it doing?</i>

05:59.120 --> 06:02.000
<i>[Thor] Searching for a way out, perhaps.</i>

06:02.000 --> 06:04.880
So much for the Negative Zone
being devoid of all life.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.720
Why does it want the Warden?

06:06.760 --> 06:09.800
You always try to capture
enemy officers for intel.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.720
It's just a bug.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.320
[Thor] Aye, a very
intelligent bug it would seem.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.240
Thor, draw it away.
We'll grab the Warden.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.200
<i>Sir! There are more outside.
My sensors show them...</i>

Oh, boy.

You're not going to like this.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.560

07:33.640 --> 07:38.120
<i>Agent Quartermain, I have Thor

Get out of there!

07:43.960 --> 07:46.640
<i>[Ms. Marvel] We'll try to slow
them down a little so you can...</i>

No. It's too dangerous.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.200
[loud rumbling]

07:58.240 --> 08:01.280
Looks like they're going to open
it for you. Everyone get ready.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.400
Thor, Carol,
you big blond bug zappers.

08:17.440 --> 08:23.320
Let's not celebrate too soon.
I have a feeling this isn't over yet.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.640
Agent Quartermain, we've
upgraded the systems

08:25.640 --> 08:27.920
using the Mandroid sensors
to scan the exterior.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.200
Good work. Put it on screen.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.039
There's so many.
Why aren't they attacking?

08:33.039 --> 08:35.919
It's like they're waiting for something.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.679
If they overrun us,
they'll be here when the next shift

08:38.720 --> 08:40.640
comes through the gateway
in less than an hour.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.480
The monsters would flood
into Midgard unopposed.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.360
We'll destroy the gateway
before we let that happen.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.320
Won't that sort of trap us here?
Like forever?

08:50.360 --> 08:54.040
As a last resort.
Until then, we hold the line.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.000
The five of us and a
handful of SHIELD agents

08:56.040 --> 08:59.880
can't hold these things off.
We'll never last alone.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.480
What are you thinking, Carol?

09:02.520 --> 09:04.480
<i>All right, everybody!</i>

09:04.520 --> 09:07.440
<i>Listen up! Most of
you here aren't stupid.</i>

09:07.480 --> 09:09.240
That'll win 'em over.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.160
<i>You all know something's wrong.</i>

09:11.200 --> 09:14.320
<i>- We knew before you did.
- Yes, thank you.</i>

09:14.360 --> 09:16.240
<i>And that's why we're looking to you now.</i>

09:16.280 --> 09:20.680
<i>Outside these walls,
there's an army of bugs...</i>

09:20.720 --> 09:23.640
<i>very hungry, nasty bugs.</i>

09:23.680 --> 09:26.720
<i>We need your help.
We can't fight them alone.</i>

09:26.760 --> 09:30.480
<i>- You will have my aid in the fight Carol.
- Thank you, Mar-Vell.</i>

09:30.520 --> 09:34.360
<i>Sure, sure, space-boy
wants to help the Avengers,</i>

09:34.400 --> 09:38.200
<i>but I seem to remember the
Avengers putting us in this prison!</i>

09:38.240 --> 09:41.920
It's true. We've fought on
opposite sides in the past.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.000
<i>And, each one of you is in
this prison for a reason.</i>

09:44.040 --> 09:46.760
<i>But, these insects, whatever they are,</i>

09:46.800 --> 09:48.840
<i>they're marshaling to attack in force.</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:50.640
And, when they do,

09:50.680 --> 09:53.360
they will destroy everyone
and everything here,

09:53.400 --> 09:55.360
<i>before swarming to Earth.</i>

09:55.400 --> 09:58.480
<i>Fight them with us, and
I will personally testify</i>

09:58.520 --> 10:00.400
<i>on your behalves at
your parole hearings,</i>

10:00.440 --> 10:05.080
<i>or do nothing...
and wait for them in your cells.</i>

10:05.120 --> 10:07.080
It's your choice.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.240
<i>I will fight these bugs.</i>

10:24.280 --> 10:26.000
Keep dreaming, Zemo.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.080
I'd rather face a million
bugs in front of me

10:28.120 --> 10:30.000
than risk one of your
daggers in my back.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.600
<i>Oh, do not tease me with such
beautiful imagery, Captain.</i>

10:34.640 --> 10:37.640
- Cap?
- Too dangerous. Trust me.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.000
Executioner, hear me.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.920
Your Enchantress has fallen into
the hands of the fire demon, Surtur.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.720
I can ensure that you get
a chance to see her freed,

10:57.760 --> 11:00.560
but you must fight
honorably in this battle.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.240
<i>Those bugs did this?</i>

11:08.280 --> 11:09.320
Aye.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.240
<i>Maybe I want back in my cell.</i>

11:12.280 --> 11:15.960
If we live through this,
I'm gonna cut you to pieces, Wasp.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.840
Then, lucky for me,
we probably won't live through this.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.880
We'll use this corridor
as a choke point,

11:22.920 --> 11:25.440
force them to come to us
through the smaller opening.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.440
Limit their numbers.
If we begin to get overrun,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.520
we'll fall back in groups,
covering our retreat.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.120
The main fall back position is the
hallway leading to the cell block.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.280
Radioactive Man, Wasp, and
Absorbing Man will cover us.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.800
<i>If they get past us there,
fall back to the control room.</i>

11:40.840 --> 11:45.600
This is our Alamo.
We make our final stand right here.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.800
As a last resort,

11:46.840 --> 11:49.600
I hit the self-destruct
sequence and blow the gateway.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.520
Any questions?

11:51.560 --> 11:56.320
[beeps]

11:56.360 --> 12:00.280
Careful with the lightning.
In this space, you'll cook us all.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.040
<i>Ahh! They're coming!</i>

12:02.080 --> 12:04.840
It's coming!

12:04.880 --> 12:06.040
[beeps]

12:06.080 --> 12:07.920
Everyone, get ready.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.080
How many this time?

12:21.120 --> 12:22.320
[beeps]

12:22.360 --> 12:24.880
All of them.

12:26.805 --> 12:29.805
[shrieks] 

12:45.885 --> 12:47.125
[strains]

12:51.765 --> 12:53.525
[gasps]

12:53.565 --> 12:55.645
I can't take it!

12:55.685 --> 12:56.685
It's in my head!

12:56.725 --> 13:00.445
Make it stop!

13:00.485 --> 13:05.045
<i>I, uh... I better
see if Leader's okay.</i>

13:05.085 --> 13:07.845
Stand your ground.
Here they come.

13:07.885 --> 13:09.125
[bugs roar]

13:14.005 --> 13:15.605
Hold.

13:15.645 --> 13:16.605
[growls]

13:16.645 --> 13:17.565
Hold.

13:18.605 --> 13:19.565
Now!

13:38.645 --> 13:39.565
[grunts]

13:41.805 --> 13:43.325
[grunts]

13:43.365 --> 13:45.405
[roars]

13:48.125 --> 13:50.045
Keep fighting.
We are holding them back.

13:50.085 --> 13:52.925
[strains]

13:55.925 --> 13:58.045
<i>They're stopping.</i>

13:58.085 --> 14:03.605
They only stop because it told them.

14:03.645 --> 14:04.725
What is "it"?

14:12.525 --> 14:15.085
[screeches]

14:17.085 --> 14:21.085
It!
Get out of my head! Get out!

14:25.845 --> 14:28.445
[all cry out]

14:36.165 --> 14:39.085
[growls]

14:43.005 --> 14:45.045
[grunts]

14:57.485 --> 14:58.485
[screams]

15:03.965 --> 15:05.005
[screams]

15:05.045 --> 15:07.765
[flesh tearing]

15:13.525 --> 15:17.485
[grunts]

15:26.125 --> 15:28.925
[groans]

15:35.805 --> 15:38.405
[gasps]

15:38.445 --> 15:40.405
[swarm shrieks]

15:40.445 --> 15:42.285
[gasps] Fall back!

15:52.005 --> 15:54.725
Okay, boys, like we planned.
Roast 'em!

15:54.765 --> 15:55.765
[strains]

15:55.805 --> 15:57.845
[war cries]

16:04.405 --> 16:07.325
[screeches]

16:15.005 --> 16:16.005
No!

16:16.045 --> 16:17.125
[strains]

16:17.165 --> 16:22.685
Annihil... Annihilate...
Annihilation!

16:22.685 --> 16:26.445
Its name...
its name is Annihilus!

16:32.405 --> 16:35.085
10 minutes until the gateway
opens from the other side.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.005
The defenses aren't
going to hold that long.

16:43.885 --> 16:45.725
[screeches]

16:45.765 --> 16:48.365
[strains]

16:48.405 --> 16:49.525
[grunts]

16:54.485 --> 16:57.965
[cries out]

16:58.205 --> 17:01.205
Annihilus, its controlling them.

17:01.245 --> 17:04.885
Kind of obvious. They go wherever
he waves that crazy stick.

17:04.925 --> 17:07.085
Captain, we must take
out their leadership.

17:07.125 --> 17:10.685
Agreed. Shield agents,
fall back to the Alamo.

17:10.724 --> 17:13.685
Hold the gate!
The rest of you with me.

17:17.365 --> 17:18.525
Forget this.

17:18.565 --> 17:21.405
Abomination,
take me to the gateway.

17:21.444 --> 17:25.885
Good idea. Let's get out
of here while we still can.

17:25.925 --> 17:27.165
[strains]

17:28.965 --> 17:31.005
[screeches]

17:31.045 --> 17:32.045
[strains]

17:32.085 --> 17:33.685
[grunts]

17:35.765 --> 17:37.765
Not even the Mjolnir can touch him!

17:42.525 --> 17:43.605
[strains]

17:43.605 --> 17:45.285
Nothing's getting through.

17:45.325 --> 17:48.325
[screeches]

17:57.045 --> 17:58.965
[screams]

18:01.325 --> 18:04.445
It's too late. Blow the door.

18:04.485 --> 18:07.605
You do it, Quartermain. If I'm
going out, I'm going out fighting.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.285
[gasps]

18:09.325 --> 18:11.365
[grunts]

18:14.165 --> 18:15.965
The computer.

18:16.005 --> 18:17.045
[grunts]

18:17.085 --> 18:18.005
[groans]

18:19.965 --> 18:22.845
Touch that computer, and
the last thing that'll pass

18:22.845 --> 18:25.645
through that oversized mind
of yours is my glowing fist.

18:25.685 --> 18:30.365
- We are not trying to escape!
- We're not?

18:30.405 --> 18:34.445
I am going to disrupt Annihilus' energy.

18:34.605 --> 18:37.445
- The energy that's protecting him.
- How?

18:37.485 --> 18:41.965
I can attempt to cram 43
years of quantum physics

18:42.005 --> 18:47.045
into that primitive brain of yours,
or you can let me do this.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.925
You got two minutes.

18:48.965 --> 18:52.685
Then I'm blowing up the
gate and you with it.

18:52.725 --> 18:55.725
[strains]

19:00.365 --> 19:01.525
<i>[Ms. Marvel] Cap, get ready.</i>

19:01.565 --> 19:07.165
<i>The Leader's going to disrupt
that Annihilus creature's energy shield.</i>

19:07.205 --> 19:10.045
[strains]

19:10.085 --> 19:12.045
[screeches]

19:13.765 --> 19:16.525
<i>[high pitch pulses]</i>

19:21.525 --> 19:24.485
[screeches]

19:24.525 --> 19:27.045
He's wide open.
Hit him hard, Avengers!

19:27.085 --> 19:28.245
[grunts]

19:31.045 --> 19:32.085
[screeches]

19:32.085 --> 19:33.845
[strains]

19:33.885 --> 19:37.005
[shouts]

19:42.645 --> 19:43.605
[grunts]

19:50.445 --> 19:52.125
[chirps]

20:21.685 --> 20:24.845
<i>Ah. I can think again.</i>

20:24.845 --> 20:27.525
The noise is gone.
The pain is gone.

20:27.565 --> 20:29.645
It was Annihilus' mind.

20:29.685 --> 20:34.285
<i>So chaotic, unlike anything
I have ever encountered</i>

20:34.325 --> 20:37.325
<i>like it was a manifestation
of the Negative zone itself.</i>

20:37.365 --> 20:41.965
<i>It could feel our universe encroaching
on its and anti-matter universe,</i>

20:42.005 --> 20:43.965
<i>and all it knew was that
it had to destroy us,</i>

20:44.005 --> 20:47.605
to destroy the positive matter,
to annihilate life itself.

20:47.645 --> 20:52.685
[klaxon blares]

21:01.085 --> 21:04.085
Gentlemen. Welcome to 42.
