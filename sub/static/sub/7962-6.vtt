WEBVTT

00:03.992 --> 00:06.459
(Frank breathing heavily)

00:09.998 --> 00:13.099
(soft groaning, sighs)

00:14.736 --> 00:17.237
(mutters)

00:17.239 --> 00:20.507
FRANK:
Oh, where am I? Oh.

00:20.509 --> 00:22.475
(phone chimes)
Oh.

00:22.477 --> 00:24.177
Where am I?

00:24.179 --> 00:26.646
Oy, I made it home.

00:26.648 --> 00:28.548
(phone chimes)
Oh, God.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.183
Oh. Oh.

00:30.185 --> 00:31.885
(beep)
Ah?

00:31.887 --> 00:34.020
Where am I supposed to be?

00:34.022 --> 00:36.056
(phone chimes)
Oh, shit, look.

00:36.058 --> 00:37.991
Okay.

00:37.993 --> 00:39.559
(grunts)

00:39.561 --> 00:41.861
Get up.

00:41.863 --> 00:43.430
Oh, I drank too much.

00:43.432 --> 00:46.399
Ooh, got to piss.
Got to piss. Got to pee.

00:46.401 --> 00:48.368
Where's the toilet?
Where's the toilet?

00:48.370 --> 00:50.003
Ah, there it is.

00:50.005 --> 00:52.272
Oh!

00:56.878 --> 01:00.947
(grunting)

01:00.949 --> 01:03.917
(flatulence squeaks)
Okay, Frank.

01:03.919 --> 01:06.119
Pull yourself together,
get to the bar.

01:06.121 --> 01:07.387
(muttering)

01:07.389 --> 01:08.388
Okay...

01:08.390 --> 01:10.457
(muttering)

01:24.539 --> 01:27.874
Eh, eh. Eh.

01:27.876 --> 01:30.143
Mm, mm. Mm.

01:30.145 --> 01:32.345
Still got it.

01:38.753 --> 01:40.987
All right, here we go. See what
we're getting into today.

01:40.989 --> 01:42.889
It's only a backup.
You're gonna be fine.

01:42.891 --> 01:44.991
If everybody sticks to the tasks
that I've carefully tailored

01:44.993 --> 01:46.926
for each of you,
then you're gonna be great.

01:46.928 --> 01:48.328
Everything's gonna work out.
FRANK:<i> Oh, shit.</i>

01:48.330 --> 01:49.963
Frank, do you know
what's happening?

01:49.965 --> 01:51.831
<i>Mm, play it cool, play it cool.</i>

01:51.833 --> 01:53.333
Ah, Dennis, I know
what's happening.

01:53.335 --> 01:55.268
Ah!
My God.
So what?

01:55.270 --> 01:57.937
Well, if we were just asking if
everybody knows what's going on,

01:57.939 --> 01:59.939
I just want to say that I do.
I wasn't asking.

01:59.941 --> 02:01.474
We're not.
That's not what's going on.
He didn't.

02:01.476 --> 02:03.176
He didn't ask that.
That's not the thing.

02:03.178 --> 02:04.944
I wasn't. All
right, you know what?

02:04.946 --> 02:07.280
Let's just... let's go
over the blueprint, okay?

02:07.282 --> 02:09.449
Yeah, the blueprint.
I want everybody to map out
their positions. Specifically...

02:09.451 --> 02:11.017
<i> All right, here's your chance</i>
<i> to catch up.</i>

02:11.019 --> 02:13.253
<i> Look at the blueprint.</i>
<i> Listen to the vain one.</i>

02:13.255 --> 02:15.455
<i> He knows the deal.</i>
<i> What's his name again?</i>

02:15.457 --> 02:17.824
<i> Is it Damon? No. Delroy.</i>

02:17.826 --> 02:21.794
<i>No. DeMarcus. Why can't I think</i>
<i> of his name today?</i>

02:21.796 --> 02:25.198
<i> Shuke. I-I think he just</i>
<i> explained the plan.</i>

02:25.200 --> 02:27.000
So I think we're good.

02:27.002 --> 02:29.335
Yeah. Frank, you ready to run us
all through it again?

02:29.337 --> 02:31.271
<i> Shit. Deflect! Deflect!</i>

02:31.273 --> 02:33.439
Shut up, bird!
(laughter)

02:33.441 --> 02:36.276
Don't ask him
to run us back through it.

02:36.278 --> 02:37.810
He knows the plan.
All right, good.

02:37.812 --> 02:39.379
So we're good.
Let's-let's do it.

02:39.381 --> 02:40.880
Yeah. Frank...
Let's do it.

02:40.882 --> 02:42.348
<i> Nice save, Frankie.</i>

02:42.350 --> 02:43.783
Like, your timing is...

02:43.785 --> 02:45.385
(mocking):
You're so funny
every time.

02:45.387 --> 02:46.819
Frank, what? Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:46.821 --> 02:48.655
Where you going, man?

02:48.657 --> 02:50.990
You got to stay back here on the
walkie in case of an emergency.

02:50.992 --> 02:52.659
Right, yeah,
emergency.

02:52.661 --> 02:54.661
Right, okay, and you
have your walkie, right?

02:54.663 --> 02:56.129
<i> No.</i>

02:56.131 --> 02:57.997
Yes.
Great.
All right.

02:57.999 --> 02:59.499
All right, let's do it.

02:59.501 --> 03:02.035
We'll be in touch.

03:02.037 --> 03:04.137
Ah, shit!

03:04.139 --> 03:06.206
Got to get home.
Got to get that walkie.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.707
Starving.
(phone whistles, buzzes)

03:07.709 --> 03:09.709
Oh, what's that?

03:09.711 --> 03:12.078
Pondy. Ha-ha!

03:12.080 --> 03:13.713
"Let's party."

03:13.715 --> 03:17.150
Ha! Sorry, Pondy. Can't.

03:17.152 --> 03:18.585
(phone whistles, buzzes)

03:18.587 --> 03:20.753
Old tits. He's saying I'm old.

03:20.755 --> 03:22.855
Goddamn it, Pondy's the coolest.

03:22.857 --> 03:25.658
L... O... M?

03:25.660 --> 03:27.560
Yeah, "M." Stupid phone!

03:27.562 --> 03:29.662
L... O... L.

03:29.664 --> 03:31.364
(horn honking)

03:31.366 --> 03:33.233
(horn honking, tires squealing,
loud thudding)

03:33.235 --> 03:35.435
Ah, shit! Probably Asians.

03:35.437 --> 03:37.670
Oh, walkie, walkie, walkie,
walkie. Where?

03:37.672 --> 03:39.372
Where the hell
did I put that thing?

03:39.374 --> 03:41.441
Where the hell is it? Ah, shit.

03:41.443 --> 03:43.943
I'll get... There it is.
Okay, got it. I'm here.

03:43.945 --> 03:46.112
DENNIS:
Keep the line clear,
you idiot. Over.

03:46.114 --> 03:47.513
Roger that.

03:47.515 --> 03:49.549
Stop talking! Over.

03:49.551 --> 03:51.851
Well, well, well.

03:51.853 --> 03:54.120
Goddamn it!

03:54.122 --> 03:56.122
(laughing)
<i> I hate this slimy bastard.</i>

03:56.124 --> 03:58.024
Where's the rent, Frank?

03:58.026 --> 04:01.594
In my pocket where it's gonna
stay until you fix the plumbing.

04:01.596 --> 04:03.630
You're playing games
with me, Frank.

04:03.632 --> 04:05.298
I don't like games.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.033
You know what I like?

04:07.035 --> 04:08.735
This sandwich.

04:08.737 --> 04:10.303
It's snake meat.

04:10.305 --> 04:11.804
(laughing)
Snake meat?

04:11.806 --> 04:13.573
Huh. Is that what
you people eat?

04:13.575 --> 04:15.708
Yeah, snake meat.

04:15.710 --> 04:18.911
(laughing)
I hope you choke on that
and die, you piece of shit.

04:18.913 --> 04:21.214
You slime ball bastard!

04:21.216 --> 04:24.150
(choking)
<i> Oh. Oh, shit!</i>

04:24.152 --> 04:25.718
<i> He is choking.</i>

04:25.720 --> 04:27.620
(laughs)
You son of a bitch!

04:27.622 --> 04:29.255
Frank?
(choking)
(laughing)

04:29.257 --> 04:31.424
You're dying,
you bastard.

04:31.426 --> 04:33.459
Look at me.
You're dying.

04:33.461 --> 04:35.328
Give me that goddamn thing!

04:35.330 --> 04:37.397
Snake meat, huh? Hmm.

04:37.399 --> 04:39.599
Mmm, mmm. Mmm!
(choking)

04:39.601 --> 04:41.067
(choking)

04:41.069 --> 04:42.635
Oh, went down the wrong pipe.

04:42.637 --> 04:44.170
(coughing)
Now I'm choking.

04:44.172 --> 04:45.738
(groans,
guttural gurgles)
(mutters)

04:45.740 --> 04:48.241
Light's going out.
(explosive pops, glass breaking)

04:48.243 --> 04:49.809
(choking)
(thudding)

04:49.811 --> 04:53.079
I don't want to die looking
at you, you savage!

04:53.081 --> 04:55.014
Shit! Ooh, shit.

04:55.016 --> 04:56.849
I'm checking out.

04:56.851 --> 05:01.421
(breathes heavily)
Somebody throw me
in the trash.

05:09.364 --> 05:12.899
(high-pitched droning tone)

05:16.871 --> 05:18.471
FRANK:
<i> Where am I?</i>

05:18.473 --> 05:20.873
<i> Where am I?! Oh!</i>

05:20.875 --> 05:23.476
<i> Am I dead? Huh?</i>

05:23.478 --> 05:25.378
<i> Am I in hell?!</i>

05:25.380 --> 05:27.146
(rhythmic beeping)

05:27.148 --> 05:28.981
<i> No.</i>

05:28.983 --> 05:31.284
<i> I died and went to heaven.</i>

05:31.286 --> 05:33.720
<i> Oh, come to Papa.</i>
<i> Let me have 'em.</i>

05:33.722 --> 05:36.189
Rest up now.
You're in the hospital.

05:36.191 --> 05:37.523
Everything's okay.

05:37.525 --> 05:39.859
Mr. Reynolds,
you're a very lucky man.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.561
If it weren't
for that choking fit,

05:41.563 --> 05:44.330
we would have never been able
to run tests, and...

05:44.332 --> 05:46.499
We found something.
You have a very serious disease,

05:46.501 --> 05:48.067
but fortunately,
we caught it just in time.

05:48.069 --> 05:49.669
There's a malignant tumor
on your front lobe...

05:49.671 --> 05:52.405
<i> Oh, look at those Winnebagos.</i>

05:52.407 --> 05:54.507
<i> Shabooya roll call!</i>

05:54.509 --> 05:57.176
<i> I would like to take a ride</i>
<i> down the Grand Canyon</i>

05:57.178 --> 05:58.644
<i> in those honeys.</i>

05:58.646 --> 06:00.179
(Frank whoops)

06:00.181 --> 06:01.981
Which sadly means,
we might have to remove it.

06:01.983 --> 06:03.649
FRANK: Huh?
DENNIS (over walkie-talkie):
Frank!

06:03.651 --> 06:06.052
Frank, come in. Over.
Oh, shit, I got to go.

06:06.054 --> 06:07.653
Sir, sir. You shouldn't be
running anywhere.

06:07.655 --> 06:09.655
Your condition may be terminal.
Out of my way!

06:09.657 --> 06:11.891
Wait, please, sir,
whatever you do, don't...

06:11.893 --> 06:13.326
(sputtering)

06:13.328 --> 06:14.527
(gasps)

06:14.529 --> 06:15.928
(slap)
(grunts)

06:15.930 --> 06:17.096
Frank, Frank, come in. Over.

06:17.098 --> 06:18.364
I'm on my way.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.066
Aw, shit. I need a ride.

06:20.068 --> 06:22.368
I'll bet Pondy will pick me up.

06:22.370 --> 06:23.770
(tires screech)

06:23.772 --> 06:25.371
Party mobile's here!

06:25.373 --> 06:26.773
Thanks for the ride, Pondy!

06:26.775 --> 06:28.274
Hop in, Frank.

06:28.276 --> 06:30.777
<i> Aw, goddamn it,</i>
<i> Pondy's the coolest.</i>

06:30.779 --> 06:33.880
It's official, Frank.
I divorced that cheatin' bitch.

06:33.882 --> 06:35.715
Yeah.
I mean, I cheated on her, too.

06:35.717 --> 06:37.583
But who's keeping score, right?
(chuckles)

06:37.585 --> 06:41.421
Anyhoo, I got a nest egg to blow
so that whore can't touch it.

06:41.423 --> 06:43.256
Let's rage!

06:43.258 --> 06:45.258
Hey. Here. Take an aspirin.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.093
<i> That ain't aspirin.</i>

06:47.095 --> 06:49.195
It ain't aspirin.
(chuckles)

06:49.197 --> 06:52.131
Does Frankenstein want
to come out and play?

06:52.133 --> 06:53.900
I'm sorry, Pondy.
No drugs for me today.

06:53.902 --> 06:56.569
I need to keep my wits about me.
Lame!

06:56.571 --> 06:58.404
More for me.
CHARLIE (over walkie):
Frank!

06:58.406 --> 07:01.073
We're outside the bakery on 6th
Street. Where the hell are you?

07:01.075 --> 07:03.409
Pondy, I need the car. Solo.

07:03.411 --> 07:05.244
Roger dodger.

07:05.246 --> 07:07.914
I'll just drop myself off
at the roller rink, you know?

07:07.916 --> 07:09.916
Get some strange. Hop in, baby.

07:09.918 --> 07:12.919
<i> Pondy is the coolest.</i>

07:12.921 --> 07:14.454
(tires screech)
♪ Rock you like a hurricane. ♪

07:20.962 --> 07:23.830
FRANK: Oh.
Dumb bird got a boot on her car.

07:23.832 --> 07:25.998
You're right,
I'm wrong, okay?!
(horn honks)

07:26.000 --> 07:28.501
Get in the car.
God. Where the hell
have you been?

07:28.503 --> 07:29.936
Don't blame him.
He's not the one

07:29.938 --> 07:31.404
who got a goddamn boot
on his car.

07:31.406 --> 07:33.806
Whose car is this, anyway?
Ponderosa's.

07:33.808 --> 07:36.409
Pondero... Aw, we're
all over the place, man!
What?

07:36.411 --> 07:38.978
What are we doing in this car?
No, no, no, no, no. We're
good, we're good, okay?

07:38.980 --> 07:40.480
Except why aren't
we moving yet, Frank?

07:40.482 --> 07:43.115
(overlapping chatter)
(tires screeching)

07:43.117 --> 07:44.584
Okay. All right. We're good.
Let's huddle up, you guys.

07:44.586 --> 07:46.018
Let's review the plan.
<i> Okay, listen.</i>

07:46.020 --> 07:47.587
<i> Pay attention. </i>
Okay, so, Frank,

07:47.589 --> 07:49.188
you're on guard dog duty.

07:49.190 --> 07:51.123
Dee, Charlie, and I are
gonna distract the guard.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.860
Mac is tossing the rug over
the barbed wire and sneaking in.

07:53.862 --> 07:55.361
Yeah?
<i> I'm still lost.</i>

07:55.363 --> 07:57.196
Uh, one problem.
We're gonna need

07:57.198 --> 07:59.632
a new rug because I
threw it clean over.
DEE: What?

07:59.634 --> 08:01.701
Oh. God...
CHARLIE:
Oh, Jesus, dude!

08:01.703 --> 08:04.136
DEE: How'd this happen?
All you had to do was drape it
on the barbed wire

08:04.138 --> 08:06.205
and-and climb
over the fence.
I'm too strong.

08:06.207 --> 08:08.541
I'm sorry, Dennis.
(sighs) "Too strong."
Okay, well, you know what,

08:08.543 --> 08:10.476
don't apologize to me.
Apologize to everybody else

08:10.478 --> 08:12.044
that you let down.
All right, we don't have time
for apologies.

08:12.046 --> 08:13.613
What's plan "B" here?
Does anyone know?

08:13.615 --> 08:15.515
There is no goddamn
plan "B." I don't know.

08:15.517 --> 08:17.850
All right, Mac, you got to find
some other way over that fence.

08:17.852 --> 08:20.520
We'll go... we'll go
distract the guard. I-I...
Yeah, yeah. Let's get

08:20.522 --> 08:22.522
a look at the schedule, maybe?
Just got to figure out
Let's go. Come on.

08:22.524 --> 08:24.156
what's going on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's a good idea.

08:24.158 --> 08:26.392
Hey, Frank?

08:26.394 --> 08:28.728
Do you think
that Dennis hates me?

08:28.730 --> 08:30.830
What?
I just want him to think
that I'm cool, you know?

08:30.832 --> 08:32.565
And I just feel like...
Is this a little bit lame?

08:32.567 --> 08:34.567
I just feel like I can talk
to you about this kind of stuff.

08:34.569 --> 08:36.168
Yeah?
Oh, yeah,
you can tell me anything.

08:36.170 --> 08:38.170
Really? Oh, well,

08:38.172 --> 08:39.839
honestly, I just feel like...

08:39.841 --> 08:41.841
<i> Oh, God,</i>
<i> this one creeps me out.</i>

08:41.843 --> 08:43.809
<i> I hate being alone with him.</i>

08:43.811 --> 08:46.145
<i> If he touches me, I swear</i>
<i> to God I'm gonna freak out.</i>

08:46.147 --> 08:48.814
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah. Totally, totally.

08:48.816 --> 08:50.983
Yeah, okay. Well, look,
if you could just casually,

08:50.985 --> 08:53.486
off the cuff, mention that I can
bench-press more than him...

08:53.488 --> 08:55.388
<i> What is that, fudge? </i>
...I think
that he'll respect me.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.056
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dude, what are you doing?
Mmm.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.891
Those are dog treats laced
with sleeping pills.

08:58.893 --> 09:00.326
Those are for the guard dog.

09:00.328 --> 09:01.994
<i> Tasty.</i>
<i> I'm gonna keep eating it.</i>

09:01.996 --> 09:03.896
Maybe I could just hop
the fence, you know? I mean...
<i> Mmm.</i>

09:03.898 --> 09:06.566
<i> Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I know</i>
<i> where there's another rug.</i>

09:06.568 --> 09:09.001
I know where I can get a rug
real quick.
What?

09:09.003 --> 09:10.603
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
(mumbles)

09:10.605 --> 09:11.871
Are you sure you can drive,
dude?

09:11.873 --> 09:14.106
Out of my way, creep.
Aah!

09:16.678 --> 09:18.911
Franklin, thank you for coming.

09:18.913 --> 09:21.547
Hey, I got no time for
swapping loads. I'm in a jam.

09:21.549 --> 09:24.283
<i> Whoa, Jews! </i>
What is this?

09:24.285 --> 09:26.886
We're sitting shiva,
for my Aunt Joyce.

09:26.888 --> 09:28.621
Come, meet my family.

09:28.623 --> 09:31.724
<i> That dog stuff is kicking in.</i>

09:31.726 --> 09:32.959
Lisa.

09:32.961 --> 09:36.796
<i> Ooh, hoo. Shabooya roll call.</i>

09:36.798 --> 09:38.798
<i> Aw, shit. There's the rug.</i>

09:38.800 --> 09:40.633
<i> Under the buffet table.</i>

09:40.635 --> 09:42.969
(distorted):
Mom, Dad,

09:42.971 --> 09:45.972
this is my part-time
lover, Frank Reynolds.

09:45.974 --> 09:47.907
<i> Whoa. Starting to feel woozy.</i>

09:47.909 --> 09:49.709
<i> Say something smart.</i>

09:49.711 --> 09:52.478
Uh, uh, excuse me,

09:52.480 --> 09:54.947
I'm full of dog poison.

10:01.956 --> 10:04.390
(gasping)

10:04.392 --> 10:06.792
(grunting, panting)

10:06.794 --> 10:09.462
That's not good.
That's not good, Frankie.

10:09.464 --> 10:11.297
What's happening?
What's happening?

10:11.299 --> 10:13.232
What's happening?

10:13.234 --> 10:15.701
(squishing sounds)

10:17.939 --> 10:20.406
(inflating sounds)

10:22.343 --> 10:24.443
Come on. Come on, Frank.
Frank.

10:24.445 --> 10:25.711
(sputtering)

10:28.082 --> 10:30.650
Hello, Frank.
Artie.

10:30.652 --> 10:33.419
Better go get that rug out
from under that table, Frank.

10:33.421 --> 10:35.588
Got to get the-the rug.
I'm getting a rug.

10:35.590 --> 10:37.923
(hooting) What?
There are drugs in
the medicine cabinet.

10:37.925 --> 10:40.126
(bell dings)
There's drugs
in the medicine cabinet!

10:40.128 --> 10:42.528
Uppers, uppers,
uppers, uppers.

10:42.530 --> 10:45.297
(grunting, muttering)

10:45.299 --> 10:46.532
Jackpot!

10:49.137 --> 10:51.637
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:51.639 --> 10:54.040
Ooh. Crush it.

10:54.042 --> 10:57.376
Crush it, Frankie.
What are you gonna do?

10:57.378 --> 11:00.012
(distorted):
Oh, slowing down.

11:00.014 --> 11:01.681
Need uppers.

11:01.683 --> 11:04.950
(groans)

11:04.952 --> 11:07.420

11:11.726 --> 11:12.958

11:12.960 --> 11:14.293

11:14.295 --> 11:17.063

Hey, are you okay?
Rug, rug, rug, rug.

11:21.736 --> 11:23.703
Get out of the way, Jew.
Out of my way.

11:23.705 --> 11:27.006
(chuckles)
Back off.

Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.

11:53.868 --> 11:56.335
Ow, hot! Hot!

12:12.553 --> 12:14.386
(retching)
Ah, that's better.

12:14.388 --> 12:15.888

I'm coming. I'm coming.

Don't worry about it, Pondy!

I'm coming! Where is he?

12:28.703 --> 12:30.402
Pondy? Where is he?!
Where is he?!

12:30.404 --> 12:33.739
Whoa.
Keep that engine running,
Frankie!

12:33.741 --> 12:36.375
(thudding, Bill groans)

12:37.945 --> 12:39.979
Screwed up, Frank.
What did you do?

12:39.981 --> 12:42.047
I got handsy
with some pretty young thing.

12:42.049 --> 12:44.049
She looked 18 to me.
I don't know.

12:44.051 --> 12:46.385
I'm out of control!
Oh, shit.

12:48.956 --> 12:50.990
Pop the glove compartment,
Frank.

(Bill chuckles)

12:54.595 --> 12:57.463
Someone's dying today, baby.

12:57.465 --> 12:59.064
No, Pondy!

12:59.066 --> 13:00.633
No!
(gunshot)

13:00.635 --> 13:03.669
Give me that gun! You
got too much to live for!

13:03.671 --> 13:05.571
You're right, Frank.
You're right.

13:05.573 --> 13:07.907
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

Eat shit, Daddy.
FRANK:<i> Oh.</i>

13:15.149 --> 13:17.416
<i> Oh, he's getting</i>

Get out of my face, old man,

13:17.418 --> 13:19.185
before I kick your ass
and throw you in that trunk.

13:19.187 --> 13:21.153
<i> I gotta think</i>

13:21.155 --> 13:22.688
Nice nips, cupcake.

FRANK:<i> What's happening?</i>

13:33.201 --> 13:36.168
<i> Oh, shit,</i>
<i>that bald bitch knocked me out.</i>

13:36.170 --> 13:38.470

13:38.472 --> 13:40.639
<i> How long have I been in here?</i>

13:40.641 --> 13:43.509

<i> Oh, is that the gang?</i>

14:11.239 --> 14:12.705
<i>Why are they dressed like cops?</i>

14:12.707 --> 14:14.707
Hey! What the hell
are you guys doing?

14:14.709 --> 14:16.208
Frank?
Frank!

14:16.210 --> 14:17.810
He's in there. Come... Frank!
Frank! What?!

14:17.812 --> 14:20.212
We didn't know when the
security guard was on break.

14:20.214 --> 14:22.414
Awesome!
You did it!
You did it, man!

14:22.416 --> 14:24.817
Okay, okay,
now go get Dennis' car!
Yeah, go on.

14:24.819 --> 14:26.752
FRANK:
That... Get Dennis' car?

14:26.754 --> 14:28.254
(Frank gasps)

14:28.256 --> 14:29.688
Hey, your name
is Dennis!

14:29.690 --> 14:31.223
What the hell are
you talking about?

14:31.225 --> 14:33.225
Dude, get my car before
the guard comes back!

14:33.227 --> 14:34.660
Go!
Go!

14:34.662 --> 14:36.195
Go!
Okay, I'm on it. I'm on it.

14:36.197 --> 14:37.663

Big spill.

14:40.768 --> 14:42.101
Oh, are you okay, man?
Are-are you all right?

14:42.103 --> 14:43.836
You all
right, Frank?!
You all right?

14:43.838 --> 14:45.771
Charlie, you there?
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:45.773 --> 14:47.339
I know. Your glasses are right
in front of you. Just-just...
Where?

14:47.341 --> 14:49.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
go, go, go, go!

14:49.277 --> 14:52.011
Faster, Frank! Faster!

14:52.013 --> 14:53.512
Where?
They're right there!

14:53.514 --> 14:55.948
Right there!

14:57.718 --> 14:59.385
(barks, growling)

14:59.387 --> 15:01.453

Run, run, run, run, Frank!
Run, Frank!

FRANK:
<i> Come on, think</i>
<i> of something cool to say.</i>

15:21.442 --> 15:22.808
Anybody need a ride?

15:22.810 --> 15:24.910
(laughter)
Come on!

15:24.912 --> 15:26.946
That's right.
Frankie, number one.

15:26.948 --> 15:28.814
<i> Nice, Frankie!</i>
<i> You came through!</i>

15:28.816 --> 15:31.317
<i> Aw, crap. This one's gonna sit</i>
<i> in the front.</i>

15:31.319 --> 15:33.118
<i> I hope he doesn't try</i>
<i> to touch me.</i>

15:33.120 --> 15:35.454
Don't touch me!
Oh, shit, dude, I'm sorry.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.122
FRANK:
<i> Think of something.</i>

15:37.124 --> 15:39.425
<i> Think of something good.</i>

15:39.427 --> 15:41.493
Dee's a bird!

15:41.495 --> 15:42.928
(laughter)

15:42.930 --> 15:46.165
(high-pitched sigh)

15:46.167 --> 15:47.833
She is a bird! She is a bird!
That's nice!

15:47.835 --> 15:49.068
(tires screech)
She is a bird.

15:49.070 --> 15:50.135
(sighs)
She's totally a bird.

15:52.173 --> 15:55.607
(Frank grunts)

15:55.609 --> 15:57.276
You getting in
there deep, Frank?

15:57.278 --> 16:00.312
Oh, yeah.
(sighs)

16:00.314 --> 16:02.448
(whoops)
What a day, man.

16:02.450 --> 16:04.083
Oh, what a day.

16:04.085 --> 16:06.485
Yeah, it sure was, Charlie.
I'll tell you, though.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.921
Great work, bud.
You killed it, really.

16:08.923 --> 16:10.422
Ah, thanks, Charlie.

16:10.424 --> 16:12.157
When you got a good plan,
you stick to it.

16:12.159 --> 16:14.360
Piece of cake.
(laughing):
Yeah.

16:14.362 --> 16:17.196
All right, well...
I guess we should go to sleep.

16:17.198 --> 16:19.698
We've got a big day
tomorrow.
We do?

16:20.835 --> 16:22.601
Yeah! With...

16:22.603 --> 16:24.203
(laughing)

16:24.205 --> 16:26.171
You're just messing with me,
aren't you?

16:26.173 --> 16:27.940
Oh, you know exactly what
we're doing tomorrow, don't you?

16:27.942 --> 16:29.341
Of course I do.
(chuckles)

16:29.343 --> 16:30.709
We got the thing
with the thing.

16:30.711 --> 16:32.344
Uh, the thing.

16:32.346 --> 16:34.346
We... yeah, we probably
should go to sleep.
Yeah.

16:34.348 --> 16:37.316
All right, well.
Hmm.

16:37.318 --> 16:39.551
Could go to sleep, or, uh...

16:39.553 --> 16:42.955
we could play one quick game
of night crawlers.

16:42.957 --> 16:44.957
Oh. Aah!
You down for that?

16:44.959 --> 16:46.959
(laughs)
I knew you would be.

16:46.961 --> 16:49.328
All right, let me get the
blanket, let me get the blanket.

16:49.330 --> 16:51.030
Okay.

16:51.032 --> 16:54.066
Darkness falls.

16:54.068 --> 16:57.403
(in old lady voice):
And magic stirs.

16:57.405 --> 16:59.304
Oh, it's stirring,
it's stirring.

16:59.306 --> 17:01.540
As we become...

17:01.542 --> 17:03.142
the creatures
of the night.

17:03.144 --> 17:06.779
(howling)
