WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.086
Previously on Beyond.

00:06.087 --> 00:09.129
Nothing will distract me
from bringing you home.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.760
So what are you in the mood for?

00:10.761 --> 00:13.843
Something orange.

00:13.844 --> 00:17.097
I see equations broken down
into an infinitesimal level.

00:17.098 --> 00:19.139
You're not some
gypsy fortune teller.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.520
I was in a four-year coma.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.811
Who am I looking at?

00:21.812 --> 00:23.103
Tess Shoemacher.

00:23.104 --> 00:25.105
CFO of Hollow Sky.

00:25.106 --> 00:26.196
Hollow Sky has been alerted

00:26.197 --> 00:28.408
to a young man
with special abilities.

00:28.409 --> 00:31.202
Perhaps you'd be interested
in making a trade.

00:32.783 --> 00:36.035
We will need to recalibrate
our approach, Dr. Frost.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.037
Frost was Arthur's partner?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.920
- You're connected to this machine.
- I can feel it.

00:40.921 --> 00:42.712
Holden!

00:42.713 --> 00:43.874
No!

00:45.426 --> 00:47.467
- Holden, no!
- I had you!

00:47.468 --> 00:49.008
And then you were gone!

00:49.009 --> 00:52.223
I won't risk that ever again.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.349
Come on. This machine
is a death sentence.

01:00.521 --> 01:03.313
How could you do this to me?

01:03.314 --> 01:05.815
I did this for you.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.647
For us.

01:07.648 --> 01:09.028
Look, you almost died in there.

01:09.029 --> 01:10.240
I won't let that happen again.

01:10.241 --> 01:11.861
What are you talking about?

01:11.862 --> 01:14.694
It was like
the ground crumbled. I...

01:14.695 --> 01:17.577
I grabbed your hands. You fell.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.160
Holden, you're not
making any sense.

01:20.161 --> 01:21.122
Yes, I am.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.253
You know I am, but...

01:23.254 --> 01:26.296
The Realm is too dangerous.

01:26.297 --> 01:28.759
We spent all that time running.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.382
Even now that we're back,

01:32.383 --> 01:35.805
after all that's happened,
I... I still can't shake it.

01:35.806 --> 01:40.390
You know as much as I do
we don't belong there.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.603
We belong here.

01:44.185 --> 01:46.816
Finally now we can pick up
where we left off.

01:46.817 --> 01:48.107
We can stay
in one place together.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.319
We don't have to run.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.691
You make it sound so simple.

01:51.692 --> 01:53.944
But it's not just about us.

01:57.037 --> 01:58.499
Was it ever about us?

01:59.950 --> 02:03.003
All our training,
remembering our time together.

02:04.955 --> 02:07.207
It's all so I could
go back in for...

02:07.208 --> 02:08.799
for him? For Arthur?

02:11.592 --> 02:13.754
Holden, what we had was real.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.178
It is real.

02:18.809 --> 02:21.311
It's just...

02:21.312 --> 02:23.354
it's complicated.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.188
Let me know
when you UN-complicate it.

02:28.819 --> 02:30.401
You know where to find me.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.108 --> 03:09.108
You feeling okay?

03:09.109 --> 03:11.901
Yeah, uh, why?

03:11.902 --> 03:14.984
Well, you mowed our entire
yard voluntarily.

03:14.985 --> 03:16.526
Any parent would
find that alarming.

03:16.527 --> 03:19.989
It's a good thing
I didn't reorganize the garage.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.323
Oh, honey,
I'd have you committed.

03:25.626 --> 03:27.377
You... going out?

03:27.378 --> 03:28.878
I'm going to church.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.290
On a Wednesday?

03:30.291 --> 03:32.211
Well, I've been wanting
to go back to work

03:32.212 --> 03:34.213
and Ian has a program
through his congregation.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.045
They need a social worker.

03:36.046 --> 03:37.427
Ian?

03:37.428 --> 03:40.180
Pastor Ian. And since
I'm still licensed...

03:41.802 --> 03:43.263
Look, honey.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.104
We all have to move forward
sooner or later

03:45.105 --> 03:47.146
and there's no time
like the present.

03:47.147 --> 03:48.478
I'm starting to feel
that way myself.

03:48.479 --> 03:49.939
Does that mean
that you're gonna give

03:49.940 --> 03:52.231
the high school equivalency test
another shot?

03:52.232 --> 03:55.315
Um, well, I was
thinking more like...

03:55.316 --> 03:57.156
getting a driver's license?

03:57.157 --> 03:59.489
No time like the present, right?

03:59.490 --> 04:01.491
Okay. I see what you did.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.703
But you are not off the hook.

04:03.704 --> 04:05.535
I mean, a driver's license
is important.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.667
But that's not what's
gonna get you a job

04:07.668 --> 04:09.539
making more than $10 an hour.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.960
10 bucks?

04:10.961 --> 04:13.793
That's like 80 bucks a day.
That's quadruple my allowance.

04:13.794 --> 04:15.585
And go easy on the soda.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.587
It's been 12 years since
you've gone to the dentist.

04:17.588 --> 04:20.010
God knows what this stuff
does to your enamel.

04:26.186 --> 04:28.147
All this time...

04:28.148 --> 04:32.231
you had me believe
Frost was the enemy.

04:32.232 --> 04:34.565
That what we were doing
was right.

04:36.397 --> 04:37.398
Now...

04:40.491 --> 04:42.703
I don't know what to believe.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.078
I've made sacrifices for you.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.290
The least you could do
is tell me the truth.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.544
Why would you lie to me?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.718
You need to rest, Dr. Frost.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.594
Seriously, Isaac.
Enough is enough.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.476
How can I rest?

05:06.477 --> 05:09.018
She's had two more seizures.

05:09.019 --> 05:10.270
You're gonna kill her.

05:11.772 --> 05:14.233
We can try nerve stimulation.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.397
She wouldn't survive
the surgery.

05:18.529 --> 05:21.532
We're sitting on our hands
waiting for a miracle.

05:27.998 --> 05:30.080
We don't have to wait.
We can use the Machine.

05:31.161 --> 05:33.583
No, it's too unstable.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.164
We can stabilize it, you and me.

05:35.165 --> 05:37.296
It's so close
to being perfected.

05:37.297 --> 05:39.299
Not nearly close enough.

05:50.140 --> 05:52.352
I love her, Arthur.

05:53.564 --> 05:55.184
I've never loved anyone else.

05:55.185 --> 05:56.647
It's always been her.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.239
I won't lose her.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.321
I won't risk her life.

06:02.322 --> 06:05.074
We'll figure out a way,
but this machine,

06:05.075 --> 06:06.366
it isn't ready yet.

06:09.199 --> 06:12.201
185 tons the Taliban has
produced in a year.

06:12.202 --> 06:15.084
Then we show up and opium
production goes to 3,400 tons.

06:15.085 --> 06:16.626
It's got to be an inside job.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.049
I mean, they've controlled
narcotics since Vietnam.

06:20.090 --> 06:22.001
Wait, who are we talking about?

06:22.002 --> 06:23.673
The CIA.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.847
What does the CIA
have to do with anything?

06:30.100 --> 06:32.562
- I think I missed something.
- Yeah? Which part?

06:32.563 --> 06:35.184
The part where you were speaking
and I was listening.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.436
Jeff, I just came by to see...

06:36.437 --> 06:38.067
It's right in front
of us, all right?

06:38.068 --> 06:39.779
People want to feel safe.

06:39.780 --> 06:41.020
Protected.

06:41.021 --> 06:42.902
Nobody questions the how

06:42.903 --> 06:45.154
so long as the what
gives them a good night's sleep.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.737
When was
the last time you slept?

06:48.489 --> 06:49.660
Take a look at that.

06:51.622 --> 06:53.242
That's Tess Shoemacher.

06:53.243 --> 06:55.164
CFO of Hollow Sky.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.165
You're doing that thing again

06:56.166 --> 06:57.646
where you suddenly change
the subject.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.841
Doesn't ring a bell.

07:02.252 --> 07:05.384
Really? Because her signature
is all over Yellow Jacket's

07:05.385 --> 07:06.846
release from the hospital.

07:06.847 --> 07:08.007
He was in the hospital?

07:08.008 --> 07:09.348
Don't work yourself up.

07:09.349 --> 07:12.431
I mean, he was in there
for only less than 24 hours.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.105
Hasty discharge considering
the extent of his injuries.

07:16.106 --> 07:18.938
So, I paid a visit to his home.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.770
Place was completely empty.

07:20.771 --> 07:22.612
I mean, the furniture, dog,

07:22.613 --> 07:25.194
clothes... all gone.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.617
Wait, wait, a second.
You're saying he moved?

07:27.618 --> 07:29.739
- Why?
- Why else?

07:29.740 --> 07:31.991
Because we're getting close.

07:31.992 --> 07:34.574
You sure we want
to be close after...

07:34.575 --> 07:35.955
what happened?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.538
You mean my brother's murder?

07:39.209 --> 07:42.421
I want to be close enough
to see the life evaporate

07:42.422 --> 07:44.253
from the eyes
of whoever is responsible.

07:44.254 --> 07:46.175
I thought I wanted that too.

07:46.176 --> 07:47.757
Then why don't you help me?

07:47.758 --> 07:51.180
Look, I hit a dead end
with the Shoemacher.

07:51.181 --> 07:53.262
But if we can somehow
get our hands on

07:53.263 --> 07:55.434
a few Hollow Sky tax documents,

07:55.435 --> 07:56.936
it'll just lead us straight to...

07:56.937 --> 07:59.398
Jeff, I can't.
Okay? I'm sorry.

07:59.399 --> 08:01.191
What do you mean you can't?

08:03.233 --> 08:06.026
Listen, Matthews.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.069
You hear that?

08:10.200 --> 08:11.531
That's the sound of the universe

08:11.532 --> 08:13.202
telling us to keep digging.

08:13.203 --> 08:16.165
Maybe it's the universe
telling us to move on.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.078
There's nothing for me
to move on to!

08:19.249 --> 08:21.041
This is all I've got.

08:23.213 --> 08:25.464
Look, Jeff, it's not.

08:25.465 --> 08:27.176
You've got a choice.

08:27.177 --> 08:29.839
When are you gonna
learn, Matthews?

08:29.840 --> 08:31.842
None of us has a choice.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.804
Eventually...

08:35.806 --> 08:39.099
we all do exactly
what the universe wants.

08:45.355 --> 08:46.737
23?

09:06.466 --> 09:07.588
What?

09:13.634 --> 09:15.676
- Come on.
- Everything okay?

09:16.677 --> 09:18.057
Yeah.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.178
I'm fine.

09:19.179 --> 09:21.682
The answer
to 11 is 'E.'

09:26.446 --> 09:28.278
12 is 'D.'

09:31.491 --> 09:32.903
Who are you?

09:33.994 --> 09:35.905
Come on. That was an easy one.

09:35.906 --> 09:38.077
Thanks. I got this.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.959
Not from where I'm sitting.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.121
What do you want?

09:42.122 --> 09:43.873
Just wanna talk.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.004
Now?

09:45.005 --> 09:47.707
Yes, now! It's important.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.800
So is this.
Please, go away.

09:59.179 --> 10:01.061
"Car is tra..."

10:07.818 --> 10:09.358
What I wouldn't give to watch

10:09.359 --> 10:11.070
this place go up in flames.

10:11.071 --> 10:13.112
Too bad it's just a false alarm.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.573
How would you know that?

10:14.574 --> 10:15.905
Don't play dumb with me.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.537
You're not fooling anyone.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.199
You did this?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.911
Isn't that a felony?

10:21.912 --> 10:24.413
It's a misdemeanor, Coma Boy.

10:24.414 --> 10:27.206
Yes, Holden.
I know who you are.

10:27.207 --> 10:28.838
Don't you want to know who I am?

10:28.839 --> 10:29.839
Not really.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.052
Well, isn't that just my luck.

10:33.053 --> 10:35.634
I meet a really sweet guy
who also happened to spend

10:35.635 --> 10:37.596
an extended
coma vacation trapped

10:37.597 --> 10:39.428
in a bizarre, fantastical world,

10:39.429 --> 10:42.021
and he just, he wants
nothing to do with me.

10:42.022 --> 10:44.644
Maybe I should
get back on Tinder.

10:46.977 --> 10:48.108
I'm Charlie.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.484
Thank you.

11:09.249 --> 11:12.211
A student ended up
in the emergency room

11:12.212 --> 11:15.174
after taking pills
left for the freshmen girls

11:15.175 --> 11:17.296
in Harrison Hall.

11:17.297 --> 11:21.060
- You've been named as...
- Yeah, I... I didn't do it.

11:21.061 --> 11:23.262
As someone who knows who did.

11:23.263 --> 11:25.564
And we know
that you didn't do it.

11:25.565 --> 11:28.517
But we know that you
distributed pills in the past.

11:28.518 --> 11:32.111
And there is enough
testimony in here

11:32.112 --> 11:34.904
to expel you.

11:34.905 --> 11:37.156
With everything that's been
going on at home,

11:37.157 --> 11:39.870
I can see why you'd
end up getting into drugs.

11:41.371 --> 11:43.122
We have a suspect.

11:43.123 --> 11:45.284
Now, I just need
your cooperation.

11:45.285 --> 11:46.625
Give me her name,

11:46.626 --> 11:48.667
and we'll let you slide

11:48.668 --> 11:50.921
with work duty and probation.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.754
Really? Wow.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.425
You... you would
do that for me?

11:56.426 --> 11:58.097
That's... that's amazing.

11:58.098 --> 12:01.511
Or we can expel you.
Your choice.

12:08.148 --> 12:10.810
Doctors said I was
unconscious for four years.

12:10.811 --> 12:13.232
I know that's not
setting any records, but still.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.026
You know, a lot can go down
in 1,461 days.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.948
Yeah. Well, when I woke up,

12:18.949 --> 12:21.030
suddenly Pluto
wasn't a planet anymore.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.701
Pluto?

12:22.702 --> 12:26.165
Is that your go-to
world-shattering change?

12:26.166 --> 12:28.828
Do you want another one?
Should I grab you a bucket?

12:28.829 --> 12:30.870
- Okay.
- Sorry.

12:30.871 --> 12:33.003
- Man.
- Um...

12:34.334 --> 12:36.006
What, can you do better?

12:38.839 --> 12:40.179
Yeah. I blacked out

12:40.180 --> 12:44.383
on August 11th, 2001.

12:44.384 --> 12:47.436
One month to the day
before the planes hit.

12:47.437 --> 12:49.810
The whole world changed
while I was under.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.602
I can't imagine.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.565
Yes, you can.

12:59.159 --> 13:02.111
So do you remember
anything from the Realm?

13:02.112 --> 13:03.953
I remember enough, Coma Boy.

13:03.954 --> 13:06.205
Dark jungles,
frozen stretches of ice,

13:06.206 --> 13:09.078
cities built
from glass and stone.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.041
And I remember
learning how to do things.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.713
Very special things.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.796
Special how?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.179
Well, it started when I woke up.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.261
I can see the world in numbers.

13:22.262 --> 13:25.634
Algorithms, time series
and data sets.

13:25.635 --> 13:28.187
So what, you're, like,
really good at math?

13:28.188 --> 13:29.979
No, Holden.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.062
I'm exceptional
at math. Hold on.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.114
Do you smell antifreeze?

13:46.656 --> 13:48.497
I'm pretty sure it's antifreeze.

13:48.498 --> 13:49.870
You don't smell it?

13:51.001 --> 13:52.502
Okay, here, just watch.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.798
And we have liftoff.

13:59.799 --> 14:01.090
My balloon!

14:01.091 --> 14:03.132
Wind from the South-Southeast.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.014
On the windward side
of the target.

14:05.015 --> 14:07.096
High voltage conductors.
Duplexed.

14:07.097 --> 14:10.230
Two inch conduits
pumping out 7,200 volts.

14:18.318 --> 14:20.780
More like 12,000 volts.

14:22.572 --> 14:23.983
Come over here!

14:23.984 --> 14:25.245
What happened?

14:39.839 --> 14:42.631
Valvoline or Prestone,
what do you think?

14:42.632 --> 14:44.924
You knew this was gonna happen?

14:44.925 --> 14:46.095
Yup.

14:46.096 --> 14:47.096
You could have hurt someone.

14:47.097 --> 14:49.808
No, no, the car from the east

14:49.809 --> 14:51.180
was going 23 miles an hour.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.012
The other car was going 26.

14:53.013 --> 14:56.145
If one car was going
32.3 miles an hour,

14:56.146 --> 15:00.069
then Houston,
we'd have a problem.

15:00.070 --> 15:03.983
You're telling me
you can predict the future?

15:03.984 --> 15:05.784
Almost.

15:05.785 --> 15:07.326
Really?

15:07.327 --> 15:09.198
I can only see patterns.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.991
That's the truth.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.744
I... I see things that look
like random occurrences

15:15.745 --> 15:17.376
like words in a book.

15:17.377 --> 15:19.748
All I have to do is read.

15:19.749 --> 15:21.630
All right, Coma Boy.

15:21.631 --> 15:23.042
I showed you mine.

15:23.043 --> 15:24.634
Aren't you gonna show me yours?

15:32.352 --> 15:34.643
Well, the Realm's beautiful
compared to this heap of junk.

15:34.644 --> 15:36.765
I'm not saying
this isn't romantic.

15:36.766 --> 15:37.977
Look, if you want to see mine,

15:37.978 --> 15:40.020
you should probably
stop talking and back up.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.194
Okay.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.617
Keep moving.

15:48.618 --> 15:50.699
Little more.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.912
- Really, Holden?
- I'm serious.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.246
Okay.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.088
Did I miss it?

16:09.089 --> 16:11.640
I'm, uh...

16:11.641 --> 16:14.093
All right, I'm gonna try again.

16:14.094 --> 16:15.595
Okay.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.192
Ow!

16:23.483 --> 16:24.563
Ow.

16:24.564 --> 16:27.906
I don't get it.
I mean, it worked before.

16:27.907 --> 16:29.158
- I...
- Don't... don't worry.

16:29.159 --> 16:31.030
It happens to a lot of guys.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.781
Well, not a lot of guys
have what I have.

16:32.782 --> 16:34.824
You keep telling
yourself that, okay?

16:36.076 --> 16:38.037
Wait, what are
we talking about here?

16:38.038 --> 16:39.619
Okay, um...

16:41.211 --> 16:42.921
let's try to recreate this.

16:42.922 --> 16:45.003
Okay, so what
brought it on before?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.836
I don't... I don't know.
It was more of a... reaction.

16:47.837 --> 16:50.179
Like... like anger
or something?

16:50.180 --> 16:51.550
The Hulk trigger?

16:51.551 --> 16:53.472
- Sounds a little...
- Are you angry right now?

16:53.473 --> 16:55.184
No.

16:55.185 --> 16:58.348
Okay, well, maybe...
maybe that's the problem.

16:59.349 --> 17:00.519
Okay.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.482
Ow! Ow!

17:03.483 --> 17:05.483
What the... Ow!

17:05.484 --> 17:06.486
Hey!

17:20.039 --> 17:21.461
You okay?

17:24.464 --> 17:26.255
Whoa.

17:26.256 --> 17:28.166
Okay.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.629
You weren't kidding.

17:31.091 --> 17:34.224
Feel like I should smoke
a cigarette or something.

17:36.015 --> 17:38.437
'Cause that's what they used
to do in the old-time movies

17:38.438 --> 17:39.889
after they would...

17:41.101 --> 17:43.021
You know, never mind.
Never mind.

17:43.022 --> 17:45.063
Whoa. You're...

17:45.064 --> 17:46.605
you're bleeding.

17:46.606 --> 17:47.947
Yeah.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.860
Oh.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.406
Was it good for you?

17:58.658 --> 18:00.539
You don't have to carry those.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.621
You called me to help.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.253
That's what I'm doing.

18:04.254 --> 18:07.086
You think Mom is gonna
have a total freak out?

18:08.378 --> 18:10.209
Your mom's going through
a lot right now

18:10.210 --> 18:11.340
with your brother and all.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.802
You getting kicked out
of school for dealing drugs

18:13.803 --> 18:15.554
may not be
what she needs right now.

18:15.555 --> 18:17.886
I wasn't dealing drugs.

18:17.887 --> 18:20.179
Just for what it's worth.

18:20.180 --> 18:23.432
So, you were covering
for somebody.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.434
Wouldn't happen to be that girl

18:25.435 --> 18:26.856
you've been seeing, would it?

18:28.188 --> 18:30.859
Something tells me we'll be
seeing a lot less of each other.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.652
Good. Time apart.
That's a good idea.

18:33.653 --> 18:36.365
Yeah, you would know,
wouldn't you?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.447
Luke.

18:38.698 --> 18:40.118
Been through a lot, all right?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.370
We all have.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.081
I just want you
to learn from this.

18:43.082 --> 18:44.204
You understand?

18:45.415 --> 18:47.836
Yeah. I have learned
a lot all right.

18:47.837 --> 18:51.129
I think sometimes
when life hands you a lemon,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.212
sometimes you just gotta shut up

18:53.213 --> 18:54.964
and eat a lemon.

18:56.216 --> 18:57.966
Let's just hope that
through all that wise-cracking,

18:57.967 --> 19:00.019
you'll think about
what's best for yourself.

19:02.021 --> 19:04.184
Speaking of self-preservation...

19:06.226 --> 19:07.897
would you tell Mom for me?

19:11.070 --> 19:12.571
For her sake, we'll just say

19:12.572 --> 19:14.733
you moved home to be
closer to Holden, all right?

19:14.734 --> 19:17.406
Finally a lie I can live with.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.658
For your sake,

19:19.659 --> 19:20.869
gonna get a job.

19:20.870 --> 19:22.830
You're gonna reimburse me
for the tuition we lost.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.205
In that case,
maybe I should just,

19:26.206 --> 19:27.786
you know, call Dean Anders.

19:27.787 --> 19:31.291
- What for?
- Well, you know, maybe it's not too late to confess.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.134
Not funny.

19:37.257 --> 19:38.848
Mom?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.932
Um, anyone?

19:44.804 --> 19:47.065
Looks like it's just us.

19:47.066 --> 19:49.269
Oh. Um...

19:54.524 --> 19:57.446
I can't believe you grew up
in a house like this.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.370
I thought they only
existed on TV.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.453
In the 50s.

20:06.286 --> 20:09.289
Hey, you...
wanna see my room?

20:16.135 --> 20:18.337
Um, your hair is in the way.

20:18.338 --> 20:19.429
I can't, um...

20:21.100 --> 20:22.642
So move it.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.935
Okay. Um...

20:38.778 --> 20:40.699
Are you shaking?

20:40.700 --> 20:43.202
No, I just, um... ju...

20:44.203 --> 20:46.665
Holden Matthews.

20:46.666 --> 20:50.499
Am I the first girl to be
brought up to your bedroom?

20:50.500 --> 20:53.041
Well, one
of the gazillion things

20:53.042 --> 20:55.083
I missed was
hanging out with girls.

20:55.084 --> 20:56.835
There, I said it.

20:56.836 --> 20:58.837
So, I take it
you don't have a girlfriend?

20:58.838 --> 21:00.549
No.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.681
Well, I did. It's just...

21:02.682 --> 21:04.513
Sort of. It's...

21:04.514 --> 21:06.184
We kind of broke up.

21:06.185 --> 21:07.886
It's complicated.

21:07.887 --> 21:09.598
Yeah, complicated sucks.

21:09.599 --> 21:11.229
You know what's better?

21:11.230 --> 21:14.062
Simple, straightforward,

21:14.063 --> 21:15.944
no-drama relationships.

21:15.945 --> 21:17.816
Yeah. That'd be nice.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.237
For a change.

21:19.238 --> 21:21.109
I'm messing with you.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.361
That would be boring.

21:22.362 --> 21:24.743
Uh, right.

21:24.744 --> 21:26.615
Um...

21:26.616 --> 21:27.996
Here, should we, um...

21:27.997 --> 21:29.998
um...

21:29.999 --> 21:31.620
Like that? Is that...

21:31.621 --> 21:34.213
Okay. Just...

21:39.088 --> 21:42.050
Wow!

21:42.051 --> 21:44.633
This picture come
with the frame?

21:44.634 --> 21:48.927
That is, um, me and my dad.

21:48.928 --> 21:50.389
We're fishing.

21:50.390 --> 21:53.482
Oh, don't tell me
this one with the go-kart,

21:53.483 --> 21:55.394
for a go-kart contest.

21:55.395 --> 21:56.435
First place.

21:56.436 --> 21:58.027
Two years in a row.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.030
Why doesn't that surprise me?

22:05.445 --> 22:08.327
Hey, do you want to
stay for dinner?

22:14.043 --> 22:15.915
Are you gonna take that?

22:19.719 --> 22:21.381
No, it's...
It's not urgent.

22:26.015 --> 22:27.387
So what are we having?

23:26.235 --> 23:28.156
- No...
- What did you do?

23:28.157 --> 23:30.029
What you were afraid to do.

23:31.030 --> 23:32.991
- Celeste...
- She's stable.

23:32.992 --> 23:34.623
But we need to bring her back.
I'm not finished.

23:34.624 --> 23:36.414
I'm not letting you near her.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.587
I don't need your permission.

23:43.212 --> 23:45.214
Stop.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.976
You're wasting your time.

23:58.558 --> 24:00.819
Why bother hitting that thing
if it won't hit back?

24:00.820 --> 24:02.482
You volunteering?

24:04.113 --> 24:08.116
Ah, my days
of fighting are over.

24:08.117 --> 24:09.868
Don't tell me.

24:09.869 --> 24:11.450
You were in
a pee wee boxing league.

24:12.782 --> 24:15.665
San Quentin. 18 years.

24:16.996 --> 24:18.376
Arthur never told me.

24:18.377 --> 24:20.629
I asked him not to.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.211
Come on.

24:23.382 --> 24:25.133
Whatever.

24:25.134 --> 24:26.756
Just another lie
to add to the pile.

24:30.890 --> 24:32.180
I asked him not to
'cause I wanted

24:32.181 --> 24:33.621
that part of my life
to be behind me.

24:34.934 --> 24:36.685
Your grandfather disagreed.

24:36.686 --> 24:38.057
Said it was part of who I am.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.189
He saw potential.

24:41.190 --> 24:43.692
Everyone else saw
an ex-con.

24:43.693 --> 24:45.564
He saw the best in people.

24:45.565 --> 24:47.026
Look where it got him.

24:49.819 --> 24:52.911
You're more like him
than you know.

24:52.912 --> 24:54.452
You saw the best in Holden.

24:54.453 --> 24:57.376
You still do,
despite what he's done.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.043
Hey.

25:05.044 --> 25:07.125
What'd you do?

25:07.126 --> 25:09.298
18 years, that's a long time.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.092
I let my emotions
get the better of me.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.475
Thank God for second chances.

25:20.349 --> 25:22.061
Keep your guard up.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.992
Oh, we told him that he could be

25:33.993 --> 25:35.614
whatever he wanted
when he grew up.

25:35.615 --> 25:37.956
So, for Halloween he was

25:37.957 --> 25:39.998
a Superman-Digimon-
astronaut combo.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.459
Super-maut!

25:41.460 --> 25:43.291
Oh, I love it!

25:43.292 --> 25:46.504
Signs of indecision appear
early in life, Holden.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.006
Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see

25:48.007 --> 25:49.798
- what happened when I was six.
- Yes, I do!

25:49.799 --> 25:51.379
- Yes, thank you.
- Yes, I do!

25:51.380 --> 25:53.091
- Please keep 'em coming.
- Oh.

25:53.092 --> 25:54.222
Please.

25:54.223 --> 25:56.805
Oh, it is so nice

25:56.806 --> 25:58.937
to finally meet
one of Holden's friends.

25:58.938 --> 26:00.940
Now I know where
he's sneaking off to.

26:02.101 --> 26:03.942
It's my fault.

26:03.943 --> 26:06.064
He's been on my case
about having dinner with you all

26:06.065 --> 26:08.356
and I...
I keep bailing.

26:08.357 --> 26:11.109
- But he finally wore me down.
- Oh, well, good.

26:11.110 --> 26:12.901
When Holden puts
his mind to something,

26:12.902 --> 26:15.193
you'd better watch out.

26:15.194 --> 26:17.156
I'm happy you two
found each other.

26:18.197 --> 26:20.538
Okay.

26:20.539 --> 26:21.830
- Mm.
- Ooh!

26:21.831 --> 26:23.121
Righty.

26:23.122 --> 26:25.464
Dear Lord, I'm moving in.

26:38.177 --> 26:39.388
Cheers.

26:44.183 --> 26:46.726
Least you're eating
your veggies.

26:50.399 --> 26:52.861
What are you doing here?

26:52.862 --> 26:54.653
Hey, my man, can I get
two more beers over here?

26:54.654 --> 26:56.364
No, no, I don't need
you to buy me a beer.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.197
What are friends for?

27:01.500 --> 27:04.542
Sorry about
what happened to Kevin.

27:04.543 --> 27:06.045
He was a good kid.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.128
Good man.

27:10.549 --> 27:12.551
I failed that man.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.514
So now it's on me
to make sure that

27:16.515 --> 27:19.558
I make the right connections
that no one can see.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.763
Think maybe you've had
too much to drink, Jeff.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.693
These are pictures of my family.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.445
- Where did you get these? Where did you get these?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

27:37.446 --> 27:38.777
Hear me out, all right?

27:38.778 --> 27:41.159
The people that killed my
brother are after your son.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.833
The hell are you talking about?

27:47.586 --> 27:49.378
That's the guy
who killed my brother.

27:51.050 --> 27:53.962
When Holden was in a coma,
was there anyone

27:53.963 --> 27:56.005
that came around
asking about him?

27:57.506 --> 27:59.387
It was 12 years.

27:59.388 --> 28:01.800
Researchers were asking
about him all the time.

28:01.801 --> 28:04.223
Anyone saying
they were from Hollow Sky?

28:05.474 --> 28:07.105
What's Hollow Sky?

28:07.106 --> 28:09.187
It's a religious organization.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.811
Tax-exempt status might
be easier than you think.

28:12.812 --> 28:14.072
And you think this...

28:14.073 --> 28:16.484
Shoemacher woman
is the head of it.

28:16.485 --> 28:19.949
No. It's someone higher.

28:22.912 --> 28:24.242
And you really believe

28:24.243 --> 28:26.624
these people are
interested in my son?

28:26.625 --> 28:28.417
I know they are.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.671
You've spun a lot
of theories here, Jeff.

28:34.003 --> 28:36.095
I think you need some help.

28:37.797 --> 28:39.598
I need your help.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.220
All right?

28:42.221 --> 28:44.843
You want to know more,
Tom, and I can see it.

28:44.844 --> 28:47.726
I need you on board.

28:56.856 --> 28:58.617
I gotta go.

29:15.084 --> 29:16.584
Thanks.

29:16.585 --> 29:18.216
How'd it go?

29:18.217 --> 29:20.428
The state of Kansas decreed...

29:20.429 --> 29:21.930
I can drive anywhere I want to.

29:21.931 --> 29:23.091
Well, not anywhere.

29:23.092 --> 29:25.053
You've still got parents. Here.

29:25.054 --> 29:26.684
Your father and I figured

29:26.685 --> 29:28.726
that you needed
an upgrade from the bike

29:28.727 --> 29:30.890
in case you want to go
somewhere on a rainy day.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.563
Wait, thi... this is mine?

29:35.694 --> 29:37.525
- Wh... Thank you!
- Oh-ho-ho-ho!

29:37.526 --> 29:40.028
- Mom!
- I put new gaskets in her,

29:40.029 --> 29:44.032
new filters, she still needs
new brake pads and tires.

29:44.033 --> 29:46.074
Probably a new fan belt,

29:46.075 --> 29:47.826
water pump.

29:47.827 --> 29:51.079
I thought we could
fix her up together.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.250
You know, be our new project.

29:52.251 --> 29:56.174
- You okay with that?
- -Dad, I drive a glorified bike

29:56.175 --> 29:57.916
and you just gave me a truck!

29:57.917 --> 29:59.878
I'm... I'm great!

29:59.879 --> 30:02.050
Thank you! Thank you!

30:02.051 --> 30:03.261
You can put it to good use

30:03.262 --> 30:05.093
and take Charlie out
for a nice dinner.

30:05.094 --> 30:07.135
Yeah, yeah, at least
to a drive-thru.

30:07.136 --> 30:09.227
Oh! Thank you, guys.

30:09.228 --> 30:10.228
I love it. I...

30:10.229 --> 30:11.689
I'm gonna take it for a spin!

30:11.690 --> 30:13.311
Whoa, hey, slow down.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.063
Still need to check in.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.485
Still need to know
where you are, all right?

30:17.486 --> 30:18.776
All right. I will.

30:18.777 --> 30:20.068
Bye, guys.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.531
- Be careful!
- Have fun.

30:29.658 --> 30:32.120
What kind of backwater is this?

30:32.121 --> 30:35.004
One of the, uh,
eight wonders of Kansas.

30:36.005 --> 30:37.126
There are that many?

30:38.627 --> 30:39.878
Oh, no.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.130
Nope. We're absolutely
not doing that.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.382
Oh, we definitely are. Come on.

30:44.553 --> 30:46.055
Come on.

30:57.146 --> 30:59.398
See? You're singing.
I knew you'd love this.

31:00.689 --> 31:03.111
Sleeping Beauty over here
thinks he's smooth.

31:03.112 --> 31:04.782
Oh, you think I'm beautiful.

31:04.783 --> 31:07.036
Don't make me push you in.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.910
Okay, Coma Boy.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.831
Tell me a story.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.753
The...

31:15.754 --> 31:17.455
the year I went into my coma,

31:17.456 --> 31:20.338
I was supposed to
visit this telescope.

31:20.339 --> 31:21.629
In Colorado.

31:21.630 --> 31:25.213
Um, this kid
in high school started it.

31:25.214 --> 31:28.136
People got wind,
he got some funding, and poof.

31:28.137 --> 31:30.599
I mean, soon it was big-time.

31:32.101 --> 31:34.603
Just I always thought
that was so cool.

31:36.105 --> 31:38.227
Course, I never got
to see it, but...

31:43.232 --> 31:45.234
All right, uh, your turn.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.082
I jumped.

31:55.534 --> 31:57.495
My coma.

31:57.496 --> 31:59.207
I jumped from the second floor

31:59.208 --> 32:00.839
of my step-dad's house.

32:02.041 --> 32:04.093
I... I didn't exactly
stick the landing.

32:06.045 --> 32:07.756
Why?

32:09.678 --> 32:11.310
'Cause I wanted out.

32:12.601 --> 32:15.053
My childhood wasn't
exactly filled with...

32:15.054 --> 32:18.147
go-kart competitions
and cheesy lasagna.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.441
I'm sorry.

32:26.065 --> 32:27.775
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
Wait, what do I do?

32:27.776 --> 32:29.988
Pull back on the rod.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.620
Start reeling, start reeling!

32:33.332 --> 32:34.662
- Wait...
- Yeah, yeah!

32:34.663 --> 32:36.494
- Oh, my gosh!
- You have one!

32:36.495 --> 32:38.166
I caught a fish!

32:38.167 --> 32:39.417
- Bring it here!
- I caught one!

32:39.418 --> 32:41.460
Hey, she's a beauty.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.084
And...

32:46.085 --> 32:47.086
Don't...

32:48.797 --> 32:50.638
Wh...

32:50.639 --> 32:53.591
What are you doing?
What did you just do?

32:53.592 --> 32:55.053
Catch and release.

32:55.054 --> 32:56.594
You're telling me I...

32:56.595 --> 32:59.807
I've been trying to hook one
of these things all this time

32:59.808 --> 33:02.480
and the point
of fishing is to not...

33:02.481 --> 33:03.981
catch a fish?

33:03.982 --> 33:07.155
I don't know.
To me, it...

33:07.156 --> 33:09.277
it never really mattered

33:09.278 --> 33:10.948
if I came away with any fish.

33:10.949 --> 33:12.030
You know, it...

33:12.031 --> 33:15.113
What mattered
was the experience.

33:15.114 --> 33:16.574
You know? The...

33:16.575 --> 33:20.039
time you spent with one
another out on the dock.

33:25.294 --> 33:27.545
I was sent here.

33:27.546 --> 33:28.797
To find you.

33:30.629 --> 33:32.181
You what?

33:33.011 --> 33:35.343
By a guy named Isaac Frost.

33:35.344 --> 33:39.097
He's the leader
of this group called Hollow Sky

33:39.098 --> 33:42.231
and he wants to meet with you.

33:43.942 --> 33:45.904
You gotta be kidding me.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.277
Should have known.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.149
Holden, wait.

33:51.150 --> 33:53.451
Hold, can you... can you...

33:53.452 --> 33:54.992
Can you just hear me out?

33:54.993 --> 33:56.204
Holden, stop!

33:56.205 --> 33:58.616
We're the ones
who survived the Realm!

33:58.617 --> 34:01.250
We're the ones
who came out of it screwed.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.839
Ever since I woke up
from my coma,

34:11.840 --> 34:14.011
people have tried to use me

34:14.012 --> 34:18.596
for their own stupid goals
and I'm so, so sick of it.

34:18.597 --> 34:21.139
And I know you are too!

34:23.942 --> 34:26.944
All I want is to be
with the only other person

34:26.945 --> 34:30.489
in the world
who can understand me.

34:34.243 --> 34:36.534
What are you gonna tell
this Frost guy?

34:39.868 --> 34:42.291
I'll just tell him that...

34:44.203 --> 34:48.667
that the point of fishing
isn't to catch fish.

34:53.422 --> 34:57.014
You never got to go to that
observatory in Colorado, right?

34:58.056 --> 35:00.269
Yeah, so?

35:19.037 --> 35:20.789
Anil Vemuri?

35:22.411 --> 35:23.951
I'm Willa.

35:23.952 --> 35:26.204
We emailed about your time
working with Arthur.

35:26.205 --> 35:28.627
Um, Dr. Foreman
and Dr. Frost.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.299
I volunteered for testing.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.631
The breakup was very ugly.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.053
Arthur repudiated everything.

35:36.054 --> 35:38.806
But the whole idea
of using science and technology

35:38.807 --> 35:39.887
to reach the afterlife,

35:39.888 --> 35:42.680
Dr. Frost was simply
taking Arthur's idea

35:42.681 --> 35:43.761
to the next level.

35:43.762 --> 35:46.184
Oh, it was Arthur's idea?

35:46.185 --> 35:48.767
Didn't your grandpa tell you?

35:50.189 --> 35:52.900
How do you...

35:52.901 --> 35:55.032
I never said
he was my grandfather.

35:55.033 --> 35:57.115
You look just like her.

35:58.327 --> 36:00.828
Just like who?

36:00.829 --> 36:03.281
Your mother.

36:03.282 --> 36:04.623
Celeste.

36:08.337 --> 36:11.629
You... you knew my mother?

36:11.630 --> 36:12.631
Of course.

36:14.052 --> 36:15.714
Her death shattered
both of them.

36:17.055 --> 36:18.257
Dr. Frost was...

36:20.849 --> 36:23.602
well, imagine losing
the love of your life like that.

36:25.434 --> 36:28.227
The love of... Frost's life?

36:30.569 --> 36:32.311
So, Frost is...

36:33.862 --> 36:36.444
my father.

36:36.445 --> 36:37.815
My baby.

36:37.816 --> 36:39.697
Where is my baby?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.198
No, she's fine.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.373
You have a beautiful,
healthy baby girl.

36:58.136 --> 37:00.638
Isaac...

37:00.639 --> 37:02.219
I saw it.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.341
What, baby?

37:03.342 --> 37:07.224
I saw the most beautiful light.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.347
It went on forever.

37:09.348 --> 37:10.519
Like an ocean.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.022
And over that ocean,
there was a bridge.

37:15.023 --> 37:17.775
A bridge leading
into the light, Isaac.

37:17.776 --> 37:19.777
- Hey...
- You were right.

37:19.778 --> 37:22.120
There is something out there.

37:23.201 --> 37:24.993
I touched it.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.250
Her blood pressure's dropping.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.584
Pushing epinephrine.

37:38.046 --> 37:40.007
Dopamine.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.680
Okay, baby. Okay. Let it go.

37:42.681 --> 37:44.181
It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

37:44.182 --> 37:45.764
It's gonna work!

37:52.100 --> 37:53.601
Okay, okay.

37:53.602 --> 37:55.193
Okay.

37:57.446 --> 37:58.607
Clear!

38:01.320 --> 38:05.663
Everyone here
has lost a loved one.

38:05.664 --> 38:09.206
We've all experienced
the pain, the despair,

38:09.207 --> 38:12.170
the cruel finality of death.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.679
But we believe...

38:23.011 --> 38:26.554
we know the question

38:26.555 --> 38:29.097
that reaches out

38:30.809 --> 38:34.231
and grabs us and takes us

38:34.232 --> 38:36.484
to the frontier.

38:36.485 --> 38:38.105
What is death?

38:38.106 --> 38:39.698
It's just the beginning!

38:44.703 --> 38:47.074
We can go to Celeste.

38:47.075 --> 38:50.157
We are finished.

38:50.158 --> 38:51.999
And Celeste is gone.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.752
Why can't you see that?

38:55.003 --> 38:56.213
But she'll be on the other side.

38:56.214 --> 38:57.665
Meaning what?

38:57.666 --> 38:59.667
You'll visit her on weekends?

38:59.668 --> 39:02.129
That's not the goal
of our research.

39:02.130 --> 39:04.802
You're so blinded
by your delusions,

39:04.803 --> 39:07.054
you still can't see
what's right in front of you.

39:07.055 --> 39:09.467
Your daughter.

39:09.468 --> 39:11.639
She needs you.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.101
She needs her father.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.185
I'm sorry, Arthur, but I can't.

39:27.325 --> 39:29.537
I'm looking for Holden.

39:29.538 --> 39:30.909
Of course you are.

39:36.415 --> 39:38.666
You're that girl from the store.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.259
Yes, I am that girl
from the store.

39:43.001 --> 39:45.003
Touché.

39:48.006 --> 39:51.138
So you two, like, a thing?

39:51.139 --> 39:53.060
"A thing"?

39:53.061 --> 39:56.064
Yeah, just the other
night, he, uh...

39:58.276 --> 40:01.108
Yeah, you know what?
Never mind.

40:01.109 --> 40:03.110
1,000% none of my business.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.783
I'll go find him.

40:06.114 --> 40:07.285
Thanks.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.674
He's, um, not here.

40:27.005 --> 40:28.215
Okay.

40:28.216 --> 40:32.180
Well, uh, could you
tell him to call me?

40:34.392 --> 40:35.934
This is my number.

40:38.106 --> 40:39.477
In case he lost it.

40:39.478 --> 40:41.059
Yeah. Sure.

40:42.230 --> 40:43.231
Thanks.

40:44.305 --> 40:50.288
