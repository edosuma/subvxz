WEBVTT

01:57.166 --> 01:58.458
Ah!

02:04.417 --> 02:06.542
( grunts )

02:41.166 --> 02:42.875
Hannah:
I don't get why you won't
just come to dinner.

02:42.875 --> 02:44.375
You're gonna have
to see her eventually.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.417
Ray:
Actually, no.
I won't.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.917
I never get
when people say that.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.959
We live in a huge
sprawling metropolis

02:49.959 --> 02:53.291
where it's very, very
easy to avoid the person
you don't want to see.

02:53.291 --> 02:55.959
- Forever.
- Yeah, but that's so sad.

02:55.959 --> 02:58.917
Why? Because we
once shared true
and stunning intimacies

02:58.917 --> 03:00.875
and now we're nothing
more than strangers?

03:00.875 --> 03:03.041
- Exactly.
- That's not sad, Hannah.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.792
That's called life, okay?
Everything dies.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.500
I don't want to hear
about this again.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.291
What's sad to me
is the fact that you're
still working here,

03:10.291 --> 03:12.208
muddying the waters
of my new establishment.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.708
- That's sad.
- You begged me.

03:14.708 --> 03:16.208
You said I was
your Squeaky Fromme.

03:16.208 --> 03:18.417
Ray:
I never used
those words.

03:18.417 --> 03:20.083
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.166
What are you
doing here?

03:21.166 --> 03:22.417
I dropped my keys
down a subway grate.

03:22.417 --> 03:25.750
- Oh, hey, Ray.
- New apartment is
working out great.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.417
Oh, great, great.
Great, good. Yeah.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.625
Did you meet
my neighbor Nancy?
She's a fuck--

03:32.583 --> 03:34.750
- Hannah: You okay?
- She's a pistol.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.625
Can I get the keys
out of your pocket?

03:36.625 --> 03:38.750
- I left the oven on.
- What's going on?

03:38.750 --> 03:41.083
Natalia:
Adam?

03:41.083 --> 03:43.208
Adam.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.375
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.959
- Who is that?
- I don't know
anybody here.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.291
Well, you're not
looking at them, so
how can you know them?

03:51.291 --> 03:54.291
Fucking going.
Come over here.
Get over here.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.125
Okay, well,
she's coming over.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.959
You big, tall,
dumb slice of dog shit.

03:59.792 --> 04:02.125
Hey, hey.
Hey, Natalia.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.166
Look at her.
Look at this angel.

04:04.166 --> 04:06.458
Look what you
did to her.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.208
She looks good to me.
Very pretty.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.083
- She's changed.
- I don't want to
do this, okay?

04:11.083 --> 04:12.708
I don't want to do this.
Let's just go.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.417
Oh, no, no.
We cannot go, no.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.500
No, this man
jilted you.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.416
You, a saint.
He said he loved you

04:19.416 --> 04:20.959
and then he just
never called you again.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.792
Yes, I know.
I know.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.500
And I am...

04:24.500 --> 04:27.083
very sorry about that.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.500
I just didn't
understand

04:33.500 --> 04:36.834
for, like, a few weeks,
you know, that it had
really happened.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.375
I know. I know.

04:38.375 --> 04:39.875
And I'm sorry.

04:39.875 --> 04:42.708
I just kind of thought
that you'd come back
with an explanation.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.333
( sighs )
I don't even know
why I wanted one.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.000
Our whole thing
was so fucked anyway.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.291
- I just...
- Adam: I...

04:49.291 --> 04:53.708
I have trouble
with confrontation.

04:53.708 --> 04:56.542
Okay, well, maybe
she has trouble

04:56.542 --> 04:57.917
being fucked
like a piece of meat

04:57.917 --> 05:00.125
and being told
that she's all you need.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.708
All right, guess what?
She's pregnant.

05:02.708 --> 05:06.875
Okay? She's pregnant
with your child.

05:06.875 --> 05:10.625
What you put in her,
it made a baby in her

05:10.625 --> 05:12.417
and now
she's pregnant.

05:12.417 --> 05:14.959
How does it feel
to abandon your son?

05:14.959 --> 05:17.375
- What?
- Yeah.

05:17.375 --> 05:20.583
Feel it.
It's yours.

05:20.583 --> 05:23.542
It's fucking yours.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.375
- That's right.
- No, I'm not.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.792
- That's right.
- Okay, I am not pregnant.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.250
- Angie: But you could be.
- Fucking shit.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.208
You completely could be
impregnated by this donkey

05:31.208 --> 05:33.458
and he'd never know
'cause he fucking
disappeared.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.917
- You are a donkey.
- Okay, I think, Hannah,
it's time for us to go.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.750
Hannah?

05:38.750 --> 05:40.208
This is Hannah?

05:40.208 --> 05:42.542
- This-- this is Hannah?
- Did you leave in a rush?

05:42.542 --> 05:45.417
It's really nice
to meet you, Hannah.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.625
Hi.

05:46.625 --> 05:49.125
Wow, so you know
what you have on your
hands here, right?

05:49.125 --> 05:52.000
You know? You know that
you have an off-the-wagon

05:52.000 --> 05:54.125
Neanderthal
sex addict sociopath

05:54.125 --> 05:55.708
who's gonna fuck you
like he's never met you

05:55.708 --> 05:58.291
- and like he doesn't
love his own mother?
- His own mother.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.000
And then you're
gonna turn around and cry,
'cause that's what you do.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Does he like to eat
you out from behind?
Does he bite your neck?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.750
Does he sound like a dying
dog when he's fucking you
and he shoots his cum

06:06.750 --> 06:08.750
- all over the place like
it's goddamn confetti?
- We're in public.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.291
- Fucking in my hair.
- Babe, you're better
than this.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.375
I had to get a goddamn
blowout after I left.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.708
You know what? You're right.
Let's just get out of here.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.125
You know what?
I hope you two--

06:16.125 --> 06:18.458
you should just enjoy
your urine-soaked life

06:18.458 --> 06:20.500
fucking like the two feral
animals that you both are.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.458
You're gonna end up
with a baby that you
don't know how to care for.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.959
- You're gonna
fucking kill your kid.
- It's gonna die.

06:24.959 --> 06:27.166
- You're gonna give it
spoiled formula.
- Dead.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.375
- Gross.
- You're not gonna get any
milk out of those tits.

06:29.375 --> 06:32.542
I just hope that you two
enjoy the fucking life
that you've chosen.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.917
And we, we're not paying
the check. Thanks.

06:34.917 --> 06:38.000
And we're not
paying the check.
Thanks.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.333
Ray:
It's on the house.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.500
I really like
that blonde one.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.625
So feisty.

06:45.625 --> 06:48.041
Feisty shiksa.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.625
( music playing )

06:57.750 --> 07:01.792
Evie:
You don't understand how hard
it is to get to this place.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.166
I didn't get here
overnight.

07:03.166 --> 07:06.166
I did a lot of self work.
I did charity work.

07:06.166 --> 07:09.000
I worked on my body.
I worked on myself.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.834
You have to work hard
to move on.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.834
I am, okay?
How do you not
think I'm trying?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.000
I've changed
my whole life.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.667
I'm doing everything
differently.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.708
Why are you being like this?
Why are you yelling at me?

07:19.708 --> 07:23.500
Because I am fucking sick
of talking about him.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.417
He is just the first
of 20 guys who is gonna
fuck you over.

07:27.417 --> 07:30.166
That's just what guys do.
Why focus on this one?

07:30.166 --> 07:32.333
It's not like he was
Liam Hemsworth

07:32.333 --> 07:35.250
or Ryan Gosling
or Channing Tatum

07:35.250 --> 07:37.250
or, I don't know,
Jan-Michael Vincent.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.208
I thought I was gonna
spend my life with him.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.708
You of all people should
know what that's like.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.542
It's hard
and it's scary.

07:44.542 --> 07:47.583
We don't get scared.
That's not our style.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.583
I gave you
my middle name, Marie,

07:50.583 --> 07:53.834
because it has
a legacy of strength
and independence.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.125
Yeah, you know
what else it has?

07:55.125 --> 07:58.333
Only one letter
differentiates it
from my first name.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.708
Which is
really weird.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.000
Mom, I go into the city
to work every day

08:02.000 --> 08:03.708
at a job
where I am respected.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.208
I have friends.
I'm getting a new
apartment.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.792
I've already
fixed everything.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.208
( laughs )

08:23.375 --> 08:26.625
- Marnie: Yo.
- Marn, where were you?
I have a meeting.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.208
I know. I'm sorry.
It was my fucking mom.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.250
- Okay, I'm sorry.
I love you.
- I love you, too.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.417
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.250
( sighs )

08:39.542 --> 08:42.207
( yawns )

08:51.708 --> 08:54.166
Hi, I'm Kelvyn

08:54.166 --> 08:56.583
and I'm an addict.

08:56.583 --> 09:01.083
I'm having some issues
with change.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.875
You know,
the first three years
that I lived in New York,

09:04.875 --> 09:09.166
it was magic.
It was just pure magic.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.625
I mean, it was like my block
was like a Fellini movie.

09:12.625 --> 09:16.083
But one that you would
actually want to watch.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.917
Just the characters
that you would see.

09:17.917 --> 09:22.375
I just miss the way
that I would just go
to the fucking corner

09:22.375 --> 09:25.667
to see what Brenda,
the guy with the flattop,
was doing, you know?

09:25.667 --> 09:29.041
And Brenda's
not there anymore.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.750
That whole world
isn't there anymore.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.166
They're all gone.
( whimpers )

09:35.166 --> 09:37.333
Hey, hey.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.333
- It's not your fault.
- ( Kelvyn sobbing )

09:39.333 --> 09:42.333
Yes, it is.
It's my fault.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.500
Jock:
Mindy. Mindy.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.667
Let's touch with our
hearts, not our hands.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.417
( chuckles )

09:51.417 --> 09:54.750
What does Kelvyn's share
bring up for you, Jessa?

09:55.750 --> 09:58.166
- Mm.
- Nothing?

09:58.166 --> 10:00.875
No, just how awkward
it is watching everyone

10:00.875 --> 10:02.667
try and get it up
for each other.

10:02.667 --> 10:06.458
This guy's crying
because a Froyo

10:06.458 --> 10:07.959
opened up
on his block.

10:07.959 --> 10:11.333
He's trying to think
of the saddest thing
he can think of

10:11.333 --> 10:14.166
and it's not
that sad.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.291
She's a bitch.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.166
Mindy, try and stay
in your experience.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.708
Mindy:
She's a bitch.
That's my experience.

10:20.708 --> 10:23.583
( laughs )
That's good.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.667
How long, Jessa,
have you been using?

10:26.667 --> 10:30.000
What do you want, Jock?
Do you want me to cry?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.417
Is that
what you want?

10:31.417 --> 10:35.041
About how my dad has been
in rehab 12 times?

10:35.041 --> 10:37.041
About how I don't even
have his number?

10:37.041 --> 10:40.625
Or my mother,
how she can't even go to
the bathroom on her own?

10:40.625 --> 10:44.250
Or how alone I feel
and without a life vest?

10:44.250 --> 10:46.917
Is that what you guys want?
Because I can do it.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.291
I'm really good at it,

10:48.291 --> 10:51.375
but it's really
exhausting and boring.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.250
And, by the way,
I figured my shit
out already

10:54.250 --> 10:57.333
when I was
five years old, okay?

10:57.333 --> 11:00.125
Heroin is really fun.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.208
But it can also
kill you, okay?

11:02.208 --> 11:04.417
- And Melvin over here...
- Kelvyn: Kelvyn.

11:04.417 --> 11:07.917
Kelvyn over here
is a dark horse
of society.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.458
- Not in a good way,
my friend.
- Oh, fuck you.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.417
Mindy:
He's not a dark horse.

11:12.417 --> 11:13.750
( Jessa laughs )

11:13.750 --> 11:17.583
Okay, let's talk about
"Mindy Methface" over here.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.750
Mindy enjoys
wearing scrunchies.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.250
No one
has addressed that.

11:21.250 --> 11:24.875
Scrunchies?
I've never worn a fucking
scrunchie in my whole life.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.583
You want to wear
them, though.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.750
How come no one
has talked about this guy

11:28.750 --> 11:30.417
and that he insists on being
called "Phred" with a "Ph"?

11:30.417 --> 11:33.083
Jock, are you just
gonna let her do this?
She's ruining everything.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.917
She's running the group now.
She's in charge.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.792
She's not
running the group.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.917
I'm sorry. Shh.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.542
( groans )
Jessa. Jessa.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.458
I don't know
what else to say.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.291
You're already
on male ban.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.625
Yeah, I know.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.208
This sign makes it
pretty clear.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.583
Jessa...

11:54.583 --> 11:57.333
how do you think
you're progressing here?

11:57.333 --> 11:59.000
You know, I think--

11:59.000 --> 12:00.458
I think I'm doing
really good.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.417
I haven't done drugs.
I've made some friends--

12:03.417 --> 12:06.792
some really ugly friends--
and I don't even mind.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.917
You know, I'm only here

12:09.917 --> 12:11.959
because it's what
my grandmother
would pay for.

12:11.959 --> 12:14.959
I do 60 days,
and then she gets me

12:14.959 --> 12:16.125
a plane ticket and rent

12:16.125 --> 12:18.542
and, actually, these
boots that I want.

12:18.542 --> 12:21.291
They're called UGGs.
They're from Australia.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.917
That's terrific.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.792
All right, get your foot
off my desk and go.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.166
This stuff is amazing.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.667
It's fantastic.
You're really cranking
on this.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.250
I'm so glad
you're happy with it.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.667
And I'm also,
it goes without saying,

12:37.667 --> 12:39.125
so glad you're not
suing me.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.208
Why didn't you tell me
you were suffering from
mental illness?

12:42.208 --> 12:44.208
That's something
we can work with.

12:44.208 --> 12:46.166
I guess I was embarrassed
to tell you the truth.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.208
- You were embarrassed?
- Yeah.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.291
You were embarrassed?
You write about jerking

12:49.291 --> 12:52.500
a kidney stone out of some
Puerto Rican Jew's dick

12:52.500 --> 12:54.750
- and you're embarrassed?
- ( laughs )

12:54.750 --> 12:56.834
Okay, I see
an inconsistency.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.625
- Seriously,
this stuff is amazing.
- Thank you.

12:59.625 --> 13:03.166
And I think we should
launch the first chapter
on Nerve.com.

13:03.166 --> 13:06.583
Honestly, any dot-com
you want to put it on
is gonna be great by me.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.667
- But I am gonna
work you on this.
- Yes.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.375
- I'm gonna
work you all night.
- Yes.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.166
Are you ready for that?
Are you healthy enough?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.875
- Fully. 100%.
- You're not shitting
me, right?

13:14.875 --> 13:17.625
I could not be more ready.
And this isn't like
the manic thing I say

13:17.625 --> 13:20.083
right before I chop
my ear off and send it
to you in the mail

13:20.083 --> 13:22.542
and blame you
for my death.

13:22.542 --> 13:25.041
Did you just
bite the cup?

13:25.041 --> 13:28.458
It's famous.
It's a trademark.
Try it.

13:28.458 --> 13:31.083
That's what this place
is famous for.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.333
I've been drinking from
a cup this whole time

13:33.333 --> 13:35.375
and I didn't know it was
made of pure chocolate?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.375
- ( laughs )
- Thank you so much.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.333
- You're welcome.
- Oh, my God.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.875
Hannah:
So my editor says my writing
is better than it's ever been,

13:42.875 --> 13:44.750
which is really
exciting and amazing

13:44.750 --> 13:47.375
because it makes me
feel like everything
that's been so terrible

13:47.375 --> 13:51.125
and painful in the last
few months was leading me
to this point, you know?

13:51.125 --> 13:54.333
And it's amazing
to realize that my
only limitation

13:54.333 --> 13:55.667
is my own mind.

13:55.667 --> 14:00.125
Like, I hold
the keys to the prison
that is my mind.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.083
What would you say

14:02.083 --> 14:04.959
are the main stressors
you're experiencing?

14:04.959 --> 14:07.458
Um, boring stuff
like money.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.417
- Money?
- Money's a tough one

14:09.417 --> 14:11.708
because I still
don't make enough
and neither does Adam.

14:11.708 --> 14:14.125
He can only contribute
a very small portion
to the rent.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.792
You know, whatever
he gets from his grandma

14:15.792 --> 14:18.000
and selling things he makes
out of papier-mâché.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.750
And what does he make
out of the papier-mâché?

14:21.917 --> 14:23.875
Is that important
for you to know?

14:23.875 --> 14:26.875
It could be.
It could be very important.

14:26.875 --> 14:30.083
Well, I thought the session
was more about me.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.583
Does he ever
make a house? Dogs?

14:32.583 --> 14:36.125
If you don't want to talk
about it, perfectly fine.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.959
Would you say that Adam's
lack of financial success

14:39.959 --> 14:42.291
makes you unhappy?

14:42.291 --> 14:43.834
No, because
he's like--

14:43.834 --> 14:47.417
he's not a traditional
person, so he can't just
be slotted into any job.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.959
You know, you haven't
met him, but it's just
like that's not--

14:49.959 --> 14:53.208
that's not how he works.
Plus, he takes care of me.

14:53.208 --> 14:55.542
In what sense?

14:55.542 --> 14:58.250
Let's see.
He makes sure
I take my medicine.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.417
- Good.
- He makes sure
I eat protein.

15:00.417 --> 15:03.792
- That's very good.
- He does this very
kind of calming chant.

15:03.792 --> 15:06.333
That's great.
I used to chant.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.667
My chanting, actually,
has gotten me through

15:08.667 --> 15:13.458
an awful lot
of... things.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.792
Okay, what was
your chant?

15:17.792 --> 15:20.291
( softly )
It's very private.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.875
Okay.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.417
Yeah, so,
it's been hard.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.667
But I'm starting
to recognize

15:27.667 --> 15:31.041
that while
I am a victim
of circumstances,

15:31.041 --> 15:33.208
I have a sickness

15:33.208 --> 15:35.000
that someone else
gave to me.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.166
And when I
remember that,

15:38.166 --> 15:42.375
I don't want to huff
lighter fluid anymore.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.166
Mm.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.500
Mm-hmm.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.959
Thank you
so much, Laura.

15:47.959 --> 15:51.583
I can't tell you
how brave you're being
by sharing that.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.500
Thank you.

15:56.708 --> 16:00.667
I feel like
you are using

16:00.667 --> 16:02.750
being molested
as an excuse.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.708
Excuse me?

16:04.708 --> 16:07.041
I'm really sorry that
your uncle fucked you,

16:07.041 --> 16:10.083
but at the end
of the day, you know,

16:10.083 --> 16:11.792
we've all
been through a lot.

16:11.792 --> 16:15.417
We can't go around
blaming other people
for our shit behavior.

16:15.417 --> 16:18.041
I just feel like
you're being a bit whiny.

16:18.041 --> 16:21.542
I don't really
feel safe around her.

16:21.542 --> 16:24.542
Mindy:
So aggressive.
You're so aggressive.

16:24.542 --> 16:28.333
Jessa, is there a way
you can phrase this idea

16:28.333 --> 16:30.792
that relates to your own
struggle a bit more?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.959
Yeah, you haven't once
told us anything

16:32.959 --> 16:36.500
about how-- what
your feelings are
about any of this.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.125
You know?
It's not fair.

16:38.125 --> 16:41.708
You're exploiting
the generosity that
we've had with you

16:41.708 --> 16:45.291
showing our feelings
when you haven't once
said how you feel

16:45.291 --> 16:47.750
about how
you have feelings.

16:47.750 --> 16:51.083
Yeah, I dare you
to tell us how you feel.

16:51.083 --> 16:55.250
Okay, I feel like
Laura might be gay.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.959
What the fuck?

16:56.959 --> 16:59.041
Hear me out,
Laura, okay?

16:59.041 --> 17:02.250
You hated having sex
with your boyfriend,

17:02.250 --> 17:03.750
even though
he played hockey.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.083
I never said that.
I never said that.

17:06.083 --> 17:09.583
And your vest.

17:11.416 --> 17:14.666
Fuck you,
hairstyle.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.791
- Kelvyn: Jock,
this isn't okay.
- Mindy: Yeah, it's not okay.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.541
- Jock: Laura!
- She's not gonna come back.

17:19.541 --> 17:23.000
You see what you've done?
That's what we call
"provocation."

17:23.000 --> 17:24.791
Kelvyn:
Everything's ruined.

17:24.791 --> 17:26.959
- Laura!
- Get me a napkin.

17:26.959 --> 17:31.125
- Kelvyn: No.
- Mindy: Don't give it to her.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.625
Do you think that
16 tacos is enough
for four people

17:33.625 --> 17:36.125
if I also get a big
bucket of ice cream?

17:36.125 --> 17:38.000
Maybe I'll get two
buckets of ice cream,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.708
'cause Marnie's actually
someone who eats more--

17:39.708 --> 17:41.250
( groans )

17:41.250 --> 17:43.333
I don't want
to do this.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.208
Do what?
Have dinner?

17:45.208 --> 17:47.458
Have your friends over.
I don't want to.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.583
Okay, well, you agreed
to it last week.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.625
Yeah, because I didn't think
it would actually happen.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.291
You always bail
on them.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.333
I don't always bail on them.
They always bail on me.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.458
Well, someone bails
on someone.

17:57.458 --> 17:59.625
Listen, if you want
to see them, go see them.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.959
But why do I have
to be a part of it?

18:00.959 --> 18:03.625
Because you're my partner
in life and love

18:03.625 --> 18:05.917
and I want you
to be a part of everything
I do on this earth.

18:05.917 --> 18:09.417
But wouldn't you rather
go to the taco and ice cream
shop with your friends

18:09.417 --> 18:11.083
and come back and find me
in a good mood

18:11.083 --> 18:13.291
rather than invade our place
and get me all pissed?

18:13.291 --> 18:15.458
No.
No, I wouldn't.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.083
I don't make you hang out
with any of my friends.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.917
You don't have
any friends.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.667
That's just
fucking rude.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.500
So is telling me
you hate my friends

18:22.500 --> 18:24.375
an hour before
they're supposed to walk
through our door.

18:24.375 --> 18:27.333
I don't hate your friends.
I'm just not interested in
anything they have to say.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.583
I'm not interested in
anything they have to say.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.500
That's not the point
of friendship.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.583
And earlier,
Natalia was saying that--

18:33.583 --> 18:36.333
Are you really gonna
bring up what Natalia said?

18:37.333 --> 18:39.166
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

18:39.166 --> 18:42.166
It's just we need
some shared experiences.

18:42.166 --> 18:43.917
Well, I'm not gonna change
into a different person

18:43.917 --> 18:45.375
just 'cause you
want me to.

18:45.375 --> 18:50.000
You have  to.
It's called "being
in a relationship."

18:50.000 --> 18:53.291
So you say.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.291
( music playing )

18:56.500 --> 18:59.208
- Are you allowed
to smoke in here?
- I am.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.708
How do you get them
to leave you alone?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.834
I have a very
respectable accent.

19:04.834 --> 19:05.834
Yeah, but so do I.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.667
You have the accent
of a little girl

19:07.667 --> 19:11.375
who grew up somewhere
between Heathrow and JFK.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.875
My daughter's is similar.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.208
How old is she?

19:15.208 --> 19:18.125
About your age, I guess.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.083
Haven't seen her
for a while.

19:20.083 --> 19:23.208
Her mother hates me
and she takes after
her mother.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.041
Do you know
that today in group

19:26.041 --> 19:29.750
some dumb bitch
threw coffee in my face?

19:29.750 --> 19:32.417
All because I told her
that she's a lesbian.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.750
I did her that favor.

19:34.750 --> 19:37.375
I just got to it quickly
rather than this bullshit

19:37.375 --> 19:38.875
of everyone tiptoeing
around it

19:38.875 --> 19:40.750
and just told her
she's a raging fucking dyke.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.333
( laughs )
Dyke or no dyke,

19:42.333 --> 19:44.375
people have to come
to things in their own time.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.083
Now, you have to learn
when honesty is righteous

19:47.083 --> 19:50.583
and when honesty is nothing
more than a party trick.

19:52.250 --> 19:55.166
You're a real shit
for not knowing how old
your daughter is.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.917
Right, filtered through
the kaleidoscope

19:57.917 --> 19:59.208
of your own
daddy issues.

19:59.208 --> 20:02.875
- I do not have daddy issues.
- Please, we all have them.

20:02.875 --> 20:05.500
Now, periodically,
if you can,

20:05.500 --> 20:08.875
take time to reflect
on the daddy issues

20:08.875 --> 20:11.000
that your daddy had
with his daddy

20:11.000 --> 20:12.708
and his daddy
with his daddy

20:12.708 --> 20:14.375
and his daddy before him
and every daddy

20:14.375 --> 20:16.834
that's been
going on daddying
before that daddy.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.250
I know you know this.
You're quite wise.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.000
You know nothing
about me.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.166
Wisdom comes
from experience.

20:24.166 --> 20:27.500
And I suspect you've had
many, many experiences.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.208
Too many, probably,
for someone of your age.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.500
I've had fun.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.542
But it wasn't
always fun, was it?

20:38.250 --> 20:40.041
No.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.375
- ( knocks )
- Yodels.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.083
Yodels.

20:52.083 --> 20:55.708
( sighs )
What do you want?

20:55.708 --> 20:57.166
To apologize.

20:57.166 --> 21:00.000
- To me?
- Yes, you.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.708
I don't want you
to be mad at me.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.333
I would hate
if you hated me.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.375
Okay, whatever.

21:08.375 --> 21:11.500
And I'm sorry
for your uncle
fucking you.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.375
And I'm also sorry

21:14.375 --> 21:17.166
that you've been through
a lot and I understand.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.500
I said, whatever.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.625
( laughs )
I don't really
need this in here.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.542
I had a weird uncle.
He was gay,

21:28.542 --> 21:32.000
but he also said
a lot of awful things to me.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.625
I was the first person
he told that he had AIDS
and I was five.

21:36.625 --> 21:39.583
Did you know
what AIDS was?

21:39.583 --> 21:42.959
Yes, and I don't
know how.

21:42.959 --> 21:46.542
But the point is is that
I also feel like a victim.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.959
Often.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.542
I am a lesbian.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.667
I think.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.125
But I still don't like
when people

21:57.125 --> 21:59.708
tell my business
out in public.

21:59.708 --> 22:03.041
And I don't like
to frickin' play sports.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.792
People always think
"lesbians like sports."

22:05.792 --> 22:07.500
And it's like, what?

22:07.500 --> 22:11.708
I'm worried if I tell
anybody, they're gonna
ask me to do sports.

22:11.708 --> 22:13.834
It's just... ugh.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.250
Do you know
how cool this is?

22:15.250 --> 22:19.417
It's like
I bet the minute
that you accept this,

22:19.417 --> 22:21.875
you won't ever want
to do drugs again.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.834
They were a placeholder
for pussy.

22:23.834 --> 22:26.667
( laughs )

22:26.667 --> 22:30.083
Have you ever
kissed a girl?

22:30.083 --> 22:32.458
Shoshanna: Basically,
it's the beginning
of a somewhat

22:32.458 --> 22:34.750
sexually adventurous
time for me.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.500
I'm alternating
nights of freedom

22:37.500 --> 22:39.708
with nights
of academic focus

22:39.708 --> 22:41.583
so that at the end
of my senior year,

22:41.583 --> 22:43.583
I will have had
both experiences

22:43.583 --> 22:47.625
while also being
super well-prepared
for the professional world.

22:47.625 --> 22:49.583
It sounds like
a really good plan.

22:49.583 --> 22:53.208
It sounds smart
and strong and feminist.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.250
What do you think, baby?
Good plan, right?

22:55.250 --> 22:57.750
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no, I think--

22:57.750 --> 22:59.708
I think--

22:59.708 --> 23:01.959
I think what you think,
pretty much.

23:01.959 --> 23:03.458
Marnie:
I think it's really smart.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.917
If you can avoid
love and feelings

23:05.917 --> 23:08.792
and matters of the heart
and soul, you will be
so much better off.

23:08.792 --> 23:10.959
Adam:
That's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

23:10.959 --> 23:13.083
She's going through
a breakup.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.375
No, no, he's right.
It totally is.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.959
I appreciate
your candor, Adam.
I always have.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.458
( mutters )
You're welcome.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.959
I sort of feel like
Charlie's gonna just
materialize

23:21.959 --> 23:24.417
in a couple of months
at some random fucking hospital

23:24.417 --> 23:26.417
and he's gonna turn out
to be one of those people

23:26.417 --> 23:27.959
who has a brain tumor
that makes him crazy

23:27.959 --> 23:30.083
like that dude who had a tumor
that made him a pedophile.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.959
And then once they medically
remove it or whatever,

23:32.959 --> 23:34.417
he's gonna go back
to being normal.

23:34.417 --> 23:35.792
It's not impossible.

23:35.792 --> 23:38.667
He could be the subject
of the next Oliver Sacks book.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.125
I don't think so.
I saw him.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.250
You saw Charlie?

23:43.250 --> 23:46.000
- Yup.
- Why didn't you tell me?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.708
You know,
it just didn't seem--

23:47.708 --> 23:49.375
we're not
really friends.

23:49.375 --> 23:51.458
- Did you know?
- No.

23:51.458 --> 23:55.250
He did not tell me
that he ran into Charlie
on Bedford Avenue.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.000
- Did he ask about me?
- Of course not.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.333
Yeah, actually.
He said, "How's Marnie?"

24:00.333 --> 24:02.333
What did you say?

24:02.333 --> 24:03.917
I said, "She's good.
She's good.

24:03.917 --> 24:06.667
- She seems very clean."
- He said you had a new job.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.792
He said you had
a new boyfriend
from Spain.

24:08.792 --> 24:12.834
Did he seem like
he had a girlfriend?

24:12.834 --> 24:15.250
You all look very
gorgeous this evening.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.875
Thank you so much, my love.
Why don't we have some chips?

24:17.875 --> 24:20.041
I didn't buy these
chips for my health,

24:20.041 --> 24:22.917
you know
what I'm saying?

24:22.917 --> 24:24.875
Marn.

24:24.875 --> 24:27.208
I just--

24:27.208 --> 24:28.458
I'm so sick of crying

24:28.458 --> 24:30.208
because this whole
situation makes no sense.

24:30.208 --> 24:33.375
I mean, we bought
the ingredients to make
grilled pizzas

24:33.375 --> 24:34.875
and we were going to make
grilled pizzas.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.875
And the day we were supposed
to do that, he left me.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.542
On what fucking planet
does that make any sense?

24:41.875 --> 24:44.500
Cheers to your fucking
book, Hannah, really.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.708
Thank you so much.
But, Marn, we're not gonna
talk about my book right now.

24:47.708 --> 24:49.250
This isn't the appropriate
time to discuss

24:49.250 --> 24:52.000
my incredibly exciting
professional endeavor.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
No, it is the time.
It's totally the time.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.250
We should also talk
about how fucking good
this taco is, huh?

24:57.250 --> 25:00.166
Am I right?

25:00.166 --> 25:03.375
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

25:05.166 --> 25:07.917
( moaning )

25:12.542 --> 25:15.250
This is getting
logged.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.417
When I was 22,
this Colombian girl
dumped me.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.125
She was both
Colombian

25:21.125 --> 25:23.875
and went to
the University
of Columbia.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.250
And she was beautiful
and she was smart

25:26.250 --> 25:28.875
and she was related
to Gabriel García Márquez.

25:28.875 --> 25:32.250
And just as fast as we fell
in love, she disappeared.

25:32.250 --> 25:34.583
And I knew
she had just used me.

25:34.583 --> 25:37.417
You know, she was
an intellectual
and I was a thug.

25:37.417 --> 25:39.417
And I just stared
at the ceiling all day

25:39.417 --> 25:42.000
remembering the first time
we fucked on my couch

25:42.000 --> 25:46.625
in Sunnyside
after a rainstorm
on a Thursday.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.625
Hannah:
Okay, I'm not a jealous
person by nature,

25:48.625 --> 25:50.542
but I really
hate this story.

25:50.542 --> 25:53.250
He's telling an incredibly
beautiful and romantic story.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.625
Then one day after being
fucked up for months,
I realized something.

25:56.625 --> 25:59.375
I didn't know her.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.542
She didn't know me.

26:01.542 --> 26:03.917
Just because I tasted
her cum and spit

26:03.917 --> 26:07.208
or could tell you
her middle name or knew
what record she liked,

26:07.208 --> 26:08.834
that doesn't mean anything.
That's not a connection.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.417
Anyone can have that.

26:10.417 --> 26:13.875
Really knowing someone
is something else.

26:13.875 --> 26:16.375
It's a completely
different thing.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.708
And when it happens,
you won't be able
to miss it.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.917
You will be aware.

26:20.917 --> 26:24.458
And you won't hurt
or be afraid.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.750
Okay?

26:27.834 --> 26:29.667
- Okay.
- Okay?

26:29.667 --> 26:33.291
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:34.166 --> 26:37.041
So I went down
on fat gay Laura.

26:37.041 --> 26:39.250
It was basically charity.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.917
You have a pretty skewed
view of the world, Jessa.

26:43.041 --> 26:45.250
Usually the more
I get to know a person,

26:45.250 --> 26:47.792
the more sense they make
to me, but not you.

26:47.792 --> 26:51.458
Do you understand
the implications your
behavior has on Laura,

26:51.458 --> 26:54.333
- on your family--
- You know, you can't
make things

26:54.333 --> 26:57.708
that mean nothing
mean something.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.375
Oh, wow.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.500
Did you read that
off a fortune cookie?

27:01.500 --> 27:03.708
Are you
a sociopath?

27:03.708 --> 27:06.667
Are you a method actor
researching a role?

27:06.667 --> 27:09.542
Well, congratulations.
You got yourself kicked
out of rehab.

27:09.542 --> 27:12.041
You did what
you set out to do.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.625
Are we done?

27:26.917 --> 27:29.542
( Adam moaning )

27:31.959 --> 27:34.208
( moans )

27:45.750 --> 27:47.625
See, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

27:47.625 --> 27:49.959
That was fucking great.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.792
No, I mean
with my friends.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.333
It was such
a successful dinner.

27:53.333 --> 27:57.417
And I hate them so much
more when I'm not in
the same place as them.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.959
And you were so sweet
to Marnie.

27:59.959 --> 28:03.583
She really needed it
and I just felt like
I know you.

28:03.583 --> 28:08.083
No matter what
your crazy ex-girlfriend
says, I really know you.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.917
- Hey.
- Yeah?

28:09.917 --> 28:13.917
I really don't want
to see your friends
for, like, three months.

28:13.917 --> 28:16.083
- Okay?
- ( laughs )

28:16.083 --> 28:19.208
I'm sorry,
I just-- I can't.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.125
( phone chimes )

28:21.125 --> 28:24.166
Who is that?
"Unknown number"?
I hate that.

28:24.166 --> 28:27.333
- Don't answer.
- Hello?

28:27.333 --> 28:30.708
Hi, it's Jessa.

28:30.708 --> 28:34.542
- Jessa?
- Don't scream.
Relax, please.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.917
Did you really
just say "relax" to me?

28:36.917 --> 28:38.166
Is that really
what you just did?

28:38.166 --> 28:41.250
Because, honestly,
sometimes when you
abandon someone

28:41.250 --> 28:43.625
and don't tell them
where you are for months,

28:43.625 --> 28:45.375
it makes them feel
pretty shitty.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.458
So then to call and say,
"Oh, please, relax--"

28:47.458 --> 28:51.458
I'm in rehab-- in the middle
of Shitsville, Nowhere.

28:51.458 --> 28:54.583
That is so great.

28:54.583 --> 28:57.458
Now I need you
to come and get me.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.792
What?
What'd she say?

28:59.792 --> 29:02.792
I'm gonna place you
on hold for a brief moment.

29:06.250 --> 29:10.291
Baby, how old do you
have to be to rent a car?
