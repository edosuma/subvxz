I'LL BE HOME

02:29.400 --> 02:34.520
YOU CAN PLAN ON ME...

NATHANIEL FISHER.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.092
( female )
Nathaniel ?

02:43.100 --> 02:44.590
IT'S RUTH.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.421
DID YOU TAKE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
MEDICATION TODAY ?

02:47.430 --> 02:48.454
Yes.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.654
DON'T LIE TO ME.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.627
I took it.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.097
What do you want me to do,
o.d. on it ?

02:52.100 --> 02:54.318
OH, AND
I JUST REALIZED

02:54.330 --> 02:56.525
WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT
SOY STUFF NATE DRINKS.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.919
YOU KNOW,
SINCE HE GAVE UP MILK.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.625
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S CALLED.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.689
Why not just cut some milk
with tap water ?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.122
He'll never
know the difference.

03:04.130 --> 03:06.121
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO, I'LL GO.

03:06.130 --> 03:08.223
IT'S NOT AS IF I DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH TO DO ALREADY.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.949
I'm kidding,
I'll get some.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.349
BUT IT HAS TO BE AFI'ER
I PICK UP NATE AT THE AIRPORT,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.123
I'M ALREADY
RUNNING LATE.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.549
NATHANIEL...

03:17.560 --> 03:18.993
ARE YOU SMOKING ?

03:19.000 --> 03:19.728
No.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.698
YES, YOU ARE,
I HEARD YOU.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.429
I'm not,
no, I'm not.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.489
LOOK, FORGET YOU'LL
GIVE YOURSELF CANCER

03:25.500 --> 03:27.695
AND DIE A SLOW
AND HORRIBLE DEATH.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.021
_ _You should not be
stinking up that new hearse.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.191
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
LET HIM TAKE IT.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.690
LIKE I COULD'VE
STOPPED HIM.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.554
HE'S EVERY BIT
AS PROUD OF THAT THING

03:35.560 --> 03:37.289
AS YOUR FOOL BROTHER WAS
OF THAT DAMN MOTORCYCLE

03:37.300 --> 03:38.528
HE HAD
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:38.530 --> 03:40.293
And who still has
a pin in his foot ?

03:40.300 --> 03:41.528
NATHANIEL,

03:41.530 --> 03:43.794
PEOPLE WANT THINGS TO BE NICE
WHEN THERE'S A FUNERAL.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.257
THEY DON'T WANT THEIR
LOVED ONES RIDING AROUND

03:46.260 --> 03:48.125
in something that
smells like an ashtray.

03:48.130 --> 03:49.722
ALRIGHT, LOOK,

03:49.730 --> 03:52.597
I'M QUI'ITING
RIGHT NOW, I PROMISE.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.421
OKAY ?
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

03:56.500 --> 04:02.951
I'LL BE HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS

04:09.630 --> 04:13.726
IF ONLY

04:13.730 --> 04:19.851
IN MY DREAMS

04:24.300 --> 04:26.757
THAT NEW HEARSE WAS
A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.591
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE OLD ONE.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.696
I THINK YOUR FATHER'S HAVING
SOME SORT OF MID-LIFE CRISIS.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.725
IT WOULD'VE MADE
SO MUCH MORE SENSE

04:34.730 --> 04:36.857
TO INVEST IN REPANELING
FOR THE CHAPEL,

04:36.860 --> 04:38.794
OR ADDING COFFEE BARS
TO THE SLUMBER ROOMS.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.928
WELL, I'D MUCH RATHER
HE BUY HIMSELF
A FANCY NEW HEARSE

04:41.930 --> 04:43.852
THAN LEAVE ME
FOR A YOUNGER WOMAN.

04:43.860 --> 04:47.296
OR A WOMAN MY AGE,
FOR THAT MA'I'I'ER.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.723
OR HEAVEN FORBID,
A MAN,

04:49.730 --> 04:52.221
LIKE MY COUSIN
HANNAH'S HUSBAND DID.

04:52.230 --> 04:55.996
GOD SURE HAS DEALT THAT WOMAN
SOME BLOWS IN THIS LIFE.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.650
MOM...

05:02.660 --> 05:05.424
CAN I DO
ANYTHING TO HELP ?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.819
NO, NO, HONEY,
I'M FINE.

05:07.830 --> 05:11.095
BESIDES DON'T YOU HAVE
A VIEWING TONIGHT ?

05:11.100 --> 05:13.489
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
BE GETTING READY.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.525
RIGHT.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.495
SO, I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THAT WHOLE SHIATSU THING,

05:29.500 --> 05:31.491
I HOPE THAT
PANS OUT FOR YOU.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.889
YOU SHOULD LET ME
WORK ON YOU SOMETIME.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.095
HERE'S MY CELL NUMBER,

05:36.100 --> 05:38.489
I'LL BE HERE
UNTIL THE 29th.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.718
HERE YOU GO.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.453
HUH.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.792
MY DAD WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET ME HERE.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.449
I COULD
GIVE YOU A RIDE.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.927
THAT'S ALRIGHT, I'M SURE
HE'LL BE HERE SOON ENOUGH.

05:51.930 --> 05:54.057
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT
THAT KIND OF RIDE.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.448
YOU'VE DONE
A NICE JOB.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.657
SHE LOOKS
SO PEACEFUL.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.594
WELL, SHE IS
AT PEACE NOW.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.751
IF THERE'S ANY JUSTICE
IN THE UNIVERSE,

06:09.760 --> 06:12.593
SHE'S SHOVELING
SHIT IN HELL.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.353
( phone )

06:15.360 --> 06:16.918
EXCUSE ME.

06:18.900 --> 06:19.753
DAVID FISHER.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.352
DAVID, IT'S CLAIRE.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.520
IS NATE THERE YET ?

06:22.530 --> 06:23.690
NOPE.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.190
I thought he was
coming in tonight,

06:25.200 --> 06:27.054
SO WE COULD DO THAT WHOLE
FORCED CHRISTMAS EVE
FAMILY THING.

06:27.060 --> 06:28.721
WELL--

06:28.730 --> 06:30.891
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
REALLY EXCELLENT PARTIES
I COULD BE GOING TO.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.891
CLAIRE.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.698
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES
A YEAR WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.498
Alright, don't get all
Pat Robertson on me,
I'll be there.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.388
I HAVE TO
DROP SOME STUFF OFF

06:40.400 --> 06:43.619
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE
BEFORE I HEAD OVER,
OKAY ? BYE.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.052
FUCKING BOY SCOUT.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.390
( heavy breathing )

06:52.400 --> 06:54.755
THIS IS KINDA
DISGUSTING.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.455
DISGUSTING GOOD
OR DISGUSTING BAD ?

06:56.460 --> 06:58.348
OH, DISGUSTING
VERY GOOD.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.896
I KNOW.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.391
YOU'RE SO
FUCKING HOT.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.719
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

07:03.730 --> 07:05.595
I'M A SWEET GUY.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.091
SHUT UP
AND FUCK ME.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.152
( phone )

07:16.330 --> 07:18.127
HELLO ?

07:18.130 --> 07:20.655
THIS IS RUTH FISHER.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.049
YES, I'M HIS WIFE.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.257
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT ?

07:26.260 --> 07:28.319
WHAT ?!

07:36.930 --> 07:39.057
( screaming )

07:43.100 --> 07:44.658
EXCUSE ME.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.752
MOM, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU-- ?

07:53.360 --> 07:56.295
THERE'S BEEN
AN ACCIDENT.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.394
THE NEW HEARSE
IS TOTALLED.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.722
YOUR FATHER
IS DEAD.

08:02.730 --> 08:07.190
YOUR FATHER IS DEAD
AND MY POT ROAST IS RUINED.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.760
OH, MY GOD.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.791
( female )
YOU CARRY A LOT OF TENSION
AROUND IN YOUR LOWER BACK.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.099
NOT AS MUCH
AS 20 MINUTES AGO.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.359
JUST SO YOU KNOW...

08:25.800 --> 08:27.927
I NEVER DO THIS.

08:27.930 --> 08:30.797
OH YEAH,
ME NEITHER.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.789
SO...

08:39.800 --> 08:42.257
WERE YOU EVER GONNA
TELL ME YOUR NAME ?

08:42.260 --> 08:44.558
PROBABLY NOT.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.225
WHY NOT ?

08:48.230 --> 08:51.154
BECAUSE I'M A REALIST.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.355
( phone )

08:54.960 --> 08:57.224
THAT'S MY FATHER
LOOKING FOR ME.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.394
HEY, DAD.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.927
OH, DAVE,
HEY, MERRY CHRISTMAS.

09:08.930 --> 09:11.922
OF COURSE I'M OKAY.

09:11.930 --> 09:14.057
COULDN'T BE BETTER
IN FACT.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.295
WHAT ?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.523
I'M SO SORRY, NATE.

09:25.530 --> 09:27.691
I HATE TO HAVE TO BE
THE ONE TO TELL YOU.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.994
THIS IS JUST
SPEED, RIGHT ?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.991
PROMISE ME
THIS ISN'T CRACK.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.126
'CAUSE I GOTTA
SPEND TONIGHT

09:45.130 --> 09:46.893
HAVING CHRISTMAS EVE DINNER
WITH MY DEMENTED FAMILY

09:46.900 --> 09:48.959
IT'S GONNA BE
WEIRD ENOUGH WITHOUT ME
BEING HIGH ON CRACK.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.622
NO, IT'S JUST
CRYSTAL METH.

09:51.630 --> 09:54.758
IT JUST MAKES EVERYTHING
BURN A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER.

09:56.030 --> 09:59.090
AND IT MAKES SEX
LIKE TOTALLY PRIMAL.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.820
HERE.

10:02.830 --> 10:04.457
IT'S ALRIGHT.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.698
OH, WELL,
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.894
( phone )

10:16.900 --> 10:18.527
IT'S MINE.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.256
HELLO ?

10:21.260 --> 10:22.693
DAVID, HI.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.622
HANG ON A SECOND.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.152
SO, IS NATE
THERE YET ?

10:31.160 --> 10:33.754
NO, HE'S STILL
AT THE AIRPORT.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.752
CLAIRE,
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.352
WHAT ?

10:48.130 --> 10:50.325
UM...

10:50.330 --> 10:52.127
YEAH, SURE.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.052
OKAY,
I'M ON MY WAY.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.094
I HAVE TO GO.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.421
NO FUCKING WAY !

11:06.430 --> 11:08.990
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.889
YOU'RE COMING BACK,
RIGHT ?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.891
UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.528
MY DAD JUST GOT
HIT BY A BUS

11:16.530 --> 11:20.125
AND IT BROKE HIS NECK
AND HE'S DEAD.

11:20.130 --> 11:23.122
I GOTTA GO PICK UP MY MOM
AND BRING HER TO THE MORGUE

11:23.130 --> 11:26.054
SO SHE CAN
IDENTIFY HIS BODY.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.857
( laughter )

11:28.730 --> 11:30.789
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.620
THIS IS ACTUALLY
HAPPENING.

11:32.630 --> 11:34.598
AND NOW
I'M HIGH ON CRACK !

11:34.600 --> 11:35.692
CRYSTAL.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.156
WHATEVER !

11:37.160 --> 11:40.425
SO, I GUESS THIS WHOLE
HELLISH EXPERIENCE
I'M ABOUT TO GO THROUGH

11:40.430 --> 11:43.228
IS JUST GONNA BURN
A LITTLE BRIGHTER NOW, RIGHT ?

11:43.230 --> 11:44.822
GREAT,
THANK YOU !

11:44.830 --> 11:46.354
FUCK !

11:49.760 --> 11:51.193
( door slamming )

11:54.460 --> 11:56.052
YOU REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.755
I COULD'VE
JUST RENTED A CAR.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.125
IT'S OKAY.

11:59.130 --> 12:00.688
YOU'RE IN
NO SHAPE TO DRIVE.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.793
AND FRANKLY,
I'M IN NO HURRY TO GET HOME

12:02.800 --> 12:05.655
TO MY FAMILY'S ANNUAL
CHRISTMAS EVE MASSACRE.

12:05.660 --> 12:08.595
PARENTS WHO STAYED TOGETHER
FOR THE CHILDREN,

12:08.600 --> 12:09.658
BUT REALLY BECAUSE

12:09.660 --> 12:12.720
THEY GOT OFF ON TORMENTING
EACH OTHER SO MUCH.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.254
MANIC-DEPRESSIVE BROTHER

12:14.260 --> 12:18.594
WHO ALWAYS CHOOSES THE HOLIDAYS
TO GO OFF HIS MEDICATION.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.659
OH, AND AN ANCIENT
SPRINGER SPANIEL

12:20.660 --> 12:23.652
WHO'S COMPLETELY BLIND,
DEAF, AND INCONTINENT.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.894
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

12:27.860 --> 12:30.693
UH, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE PRETTY NORMAL.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.850
MY MOM'S
A CONTROL FREAK.

12:32.860 --> 12:35.124
MY BROTHER, UM,

12:35.130 --> 12:37.951
WELL, HE'S A
CONTROL FREAK, TOO.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.793
AN D, MY SISTER...

12:40.800 --> 12:43.689
WELL, I LEFT HOME
RIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS BORN,

12:43.700 --> 12:45.918
SO I NEVER REALLY
KNEW HER THAT WELL,

12:45.930 --> 12:48.353
BUT SHE'S KIND OF WILD
LIKE I WAS.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.657
WAS ?

12:54.160 --> 12:57.129
MY DAD REALLY RODE MY ASS
WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:58.630 --> 13:02.088
I COULDN'T GO RAFTING
'CAUSE HE'D JUST BURIED
THIS GIRL WHO DROWNED.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.419
HE BURIES THIS
DIPSHIT LOSER

13:03.430 --> 13:05.250
WHO O.D.'d
AT A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS CONCERT,

13:05.260 --> 13:08.229
SUDDENLY I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO GO TO CONCERTS FOR A YEAR.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.857
YOUR DAD WORKED
IN A CEMETERY ?

13:09.860 --> 13:11.999
HOW COULD A MAN WHO'S
SO FUCKING SCARED OF EVERYTHING

13:12.000 --> 13:13.991
WHO NEVER
HAD AN A ACCIDENT

13:14.000 --> 13:16.252
OR EVEN A SPEEDING TICKET
IN HIS ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE,

13:16.260 --> 13:18.251
HOW COULD HE
HAVE A CAR WRECK ?

13:18.260 --> 13:20.148
ARE YOU MAD AT HIM,

13:20.160 --> 13:22.890
OR THE FACT THAT
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE ?

13:22.900 --> 13:25.653
ARE YOU A SHRINK ?

13:25.660 --> 13:28.254
NO, GOD, NO !

13:28.260 --> 13:29.852
NO!

13:29.860 --> 13:31.623
BOTH MY PARENTS ARE.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.852
SO, WHAT ELSE DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT ?

13:37.860 --> 13:40.397
THE WEATHER ?

13:40.400 --> 13:45.019
OR THE FACT THAT WE BOTH JUST
FUCKED A PERFECT STRANGER ?

13:45.030 --> 13:48.852
AND THAT WE BOTH LIED WHEN
WE SAID WE NEVER DID THAT ?

13:52.630 --> 13:54.598
( chattering )

13:57.230 --> 13:58.857
( male )
WONDERFUL SERVICE.

13:58.860 --> 14:01.522
( female )
YES, IT WAS,
VERY NICE.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.929
AHH... !

14:11.660 --> 14:14.493
SHE LOOKED SO PEACEFUL,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.649
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.196
WONDERFUL JOB.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.823
DID YOU KNOW THAT
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,

14:23.830 --> 14:25.957
FUNERAL HOMES RAN
THE AMBULANCE BUSINESS ?

14:25.960 --> 14:28.099
NO.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.455
HEARSES WERE
THE ONLY VEHICLES

14:30.460 --> 14:33.327
THAT COULD TRANSPORT
PEOPLE LYING DOWN.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.389
WOW.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.198
YOUR FATHER USED TO
JOKE ABOUT THAT.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.296
JUST DRIVE HIM AROUND
THE BLOCK A FEW MORE TIMES,

14:42.300 --> 14:44.655
AND WE WON'T NEED
TO STOP AT THE HOSPITAL.

14:44.660 --> 14:48.391
YOU'RE KIND OF
FREAKING ME OUT RIGHT NOW.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.994
CLAIRE...

14:51.000 --> 14:54.049
ARE YOU
HAVING SEX ?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.596
WHAT ?

14:55.600 --> 14:57.556
OR DOING DRUGS ?

14:57.560 --> 15:01.155
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
THIS RIGHT NOW ?

15:01.160 --> 15:03.924
YOUR FATHER IS DEAD.

15:03.930 --> 15:06.455
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

15:06.460 --> 15:09.190
YOU AND I TALKED
ABOUT ANYTHING IMPORTANT.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.294
I NEED TO KNOW
YOU'RE OKAY.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.825
OH, YEAH...

15:17.360 --> 15:20.397
BELIEVE ME,
I'M OKAY.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.655
YOU KNOW,
CONSIDERING.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.959
DO YOU WORK HERE ?

15:32.960 --> 15:34.427
UH, YES.

15:34.430 --> 15:36.990
I WANTED TO COMPLIMENT
YOU ON THE MUSIC.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.059
I'VE BEEN TO THREE OTHER
FUNERALS THIS YEAR.

15:39.060 --> 15:42.120
CANCER, STROKE,
PEDIATRIC LEUKEMIA,

15:42.130 --> 15:45.691
AND THE MUSIC IS ALWAYS
THAT SAME SAD ORGAN MUSIC.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.793
IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE
SOAP OPERAS MY MOM
USED TO WATCH

15:47.800 --> 15:49.688
BEFORE I STARTED
KINDERGARTEN.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.624
OH GOD, YOU'RE PROBABLY
TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THAT.

15:52.630 --> 15:55.451
ANYWAY, I SO PREFER
THIS LIGHT CLASSICAL,

15:55.460 --> 15:58.224
YOU KNOW,
CHAMBER ORCHESTRA STUFF.

15:58.230 --> 15:59.424
IT'S STILL SPIRITUAL,

15:59.430 --> 16:02.149
BUT DOESN'T SEEM
SO DATED OR DEPRESSING.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.457
I STUDIED
MUSIC APPRECIATION...

16:03.460 --> 16:05.098
( female voice )
YOU THINK I'M REALLY
BORING, DON'T YOU ?

16:05.100 --> 16:06.453
WELL, GET USED TO IT.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.018
BECAUSE NOW
THAT YOUR FATHER IS DEAD,

16:08.030 --> 16:10.123
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
EVER GOING LAW SCHOOL.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.724
IT'S JUST YOU, AND DEAD PEOPLE,
AND FREAKS LIKE ME

16:12.730 --> 16:14.357
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE !

16:14.360 --> 16:16.055
AAH...!

16:23.400 --> 16:24.958
MOM !

16:27.100 --> 16:28.988
MOM, I'M SO SORRY.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.821
WHO'S SHE ?

16:33.830 --> 16:35.991
AH...

16:36.000 --> 16:37.297
THIS IS, UM...

16:37.300 --> 16:38.597
BRENDA CHENOWETH.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.352
BRENDA...
CHENOWETH.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.225
UM, BRENDA,

16:42.230 --> 16:44.755
THIS IS MY MOM,
RUTH FISHER,

16:44.760 --> 16:48.025
AND MY SISTER,
CLAIRE.

16:48.030 --> 16:50.225
UM, NATE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND ?

16:50.230 --> 16:52.118
YEAH, JUST
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

16:52.130 --> 16:55.327
MOM, DID YOU
ALREADY DO THE--

16:55.330 --> 16:56.797
I CAN'T.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.825
I'VE SEEN TOO MANY
DEAD PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

16:58.830 --> 16:59.956
THEY'RE WORK.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.053
I WON'T SEE
YOUR FATHER THAT WAY.

17:02.060 --> 17:03.755
I NEED YOU
TO DO IT.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.092
OH.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.625
NATE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
NOW, PLEASE, IT'S URGENT.

17:13.360 --> 17:16.227
SO, HOW DID YOU
AND MY SON MEET ?

17:16.230 --> 17:18.027
IN COOKING CLASS.

17:19.730 --> 17:22.028
I HAVE TO
TELL SOMEBODY.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.497
I AM TWEAKING.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.819
YEAH, WE'RE
ALL UPSET.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.889
NO, I'M HIGH
ON CRYSTAL.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.027
I SMOKED SOME WITH SOME FRIENDS
BEFORE DAVID CALLED ME.

17:29.030 --> 17:30.725
YOU DID WHAT ?

17:30.730 --> 17:32.391
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S THE FIRST TIME.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.697
BUT I THINK I'M HAVING
SOME KIND OF A MELTDOWN,

17:33.700 --> 17:36.919
AND I CAN'T TELL
IF IT'S DAD BEING DEAD
OR THE CRYSTAL.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.558
I'M REALLY SCARED.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.927
YOU CANNOT DO THIS
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

17:42.930 --> 17:45.990
DON'T BE SUCH A NARC,
WE SMOKED POT AT THANKSGIVING.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.696
LOOK, I HAVE TO GO IDENTIFY
OUR DEAD FATHER'S BODY.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.453
I'M SORRY YOU'RE HAVING
A BAD DRUG EXPERIENCE,

17:51.460 --> 17:53.291
BUT DEAL WITH IT.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.051
( unzippering )

18:19.900 --> 18:21.720
WELL ?

18:25.160 --> 18:26.821
( father's voice )
WELL, WELL.

18:26.830 --> 18:29.594
THE PRODIGAL RETURNS.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.420
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
RUNNING AWAY FROM

18:31.430 --> 18:33.421
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,
BUDDY BOY.

18:33.430 --> 18:34.920
SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF YOU

18:34.930 --> 18:37.194
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP,
DIDN'T IT ?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.727
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU'D ESCAPE,
WELL, GUESS WHAT ?

18:40.730 --> 18:44.154
NOBODY ESCAPES.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.157
WELL ?

18:51.160 --> 18:53.128
YEAH,
THAT'S HIM.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.598
OKAY, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:02.630 --> 19:04.825
HOW'D HE LOOK ?

19:04.830 --> 19:07.651
DEAD.

19:07.660 --> 19:11.118
WILL THERE NEED TO BE
A LOT OF RECONSTRUCTION ?

19:11.130 --> 19:14.850
DAVID'S NOT THAT SKILL
AT THE REALLY HARD STUFF.

19:14.860 --> 19:17.795
FEDERICO USUALLY DOES THAT,
HE'S QUITE GIFTED.

19:17.800 --> 19:22.157
YOU DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE TO
HAVE A CLOSED CASKET, DO YOU ?

19:22.160 --> 19:25.049
I WOULD HATE TO
SEND THAT MESSAGE.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.220
WHAT MESSAGE ?

19:26.230 --> 19:28.721
THAT WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED
TO HANDLE A MAJOR RESTORATION,

19:28.730 --> 19:30.129
OR THAT WE'RE NOT
PROUD OF OUR WORK.

19:30.130 --> 19:31.995
MOM, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER ?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.991
WE SHOULD REALLY GET NATE HOME,
HE'S PROBABLY EXHAUSTED.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.695
LET'S GO.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.727
UM...

19:47.730 --> 19:49.698
THAN KS...

19:49.700 --> 19:50.928
FOR DRIVING
ME HERE.

19:50.930 --> 19:51.794
PLEASE.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.018
I'M JUST AVOIDING
MY OWN HELL.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.248
I'M A BIG COWARD.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.891
ME, TOO.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.649
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE THIS.

20:03.660 --> 20:07.699
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.228
I WISH YOU
THE BEST, NATE.

20:12.230 --> 20:14.050
GOODBYE.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.493
CLAIRE...

20:34.500 --> 20:36.855
YOU'RE DRIVING
TOO FAST.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.499
THIS ISN'T FAST,
YOU WANNA SEE FAST ?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.855
( engine accelerates )

20:44.060 --> 20:45.925
PULL OVER !

20:55.700 --> 20:57.691
LISTEN, DO YOU
DO A LOT OF DRUGS ?

20:57.700 --> 20:58.997
WHAT ?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.092
NO.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.397
AND IT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.549
YES, IT IS
MY BUSINESS.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.425
LOOK, YOU WERE DRIVING
LIKE A MANIAC BACK THERE,

21:04.430 --> 21:06.159
YOU COULD'VE
GOTTEN US ALL KILLED.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.320
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS ?

21:07.330 --> 21:09.025
YOU'RE NOT
MY FATHER.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.157
YOU SPLIT AS SOON AS YOU COULD,
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.856
SO, DON'T START THINKING YOU CAN
TELL ME WHAT TO DO, OKAY ?

21:22.560 --> 21:24.323
( door opening )

21:31.730 --> 21:35.291
SO, WHERE'S DAD,
DOWNSTAIRS ALREADY ?

21:35.300 --> 21:38.121
UM, HE'S STILL
IN THE MORGUE.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.223
YOU DIDN'T BRING HIM
BACK WITH YOU ?

21:40.230 --> 21:42.118
( mother)
OH, DEAR.

21:42.130 --> 21:45.497
THAT DIDN'T EVEN
CROSS MY MIND.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.856
WE SHOULD'VE TAKEN THE VAN
SO WE COULD BRING HIM HOME.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.896
I'M SORRY.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.528
THAT WAS VERY
STUPID OF ME.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.198
NICE GOING, DAVE.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.294
LIKE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO FEEL BAD ABOUT RIGHT NOW ?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.222
THINGS HAVE
TO BE DONE.

22:06.230 --> 22:08.357
FEDERICO'S DOWNSTAIRS,
READY TO START.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.657
EVERY SECOND WE WAIT

22:09.660 --> 22:11.890
WILL ONLY MAKE
DAD'S RESTORATION
MORE DIFFICULT.

22:11.900 --> 22:14.152
BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, WOULD YOU ?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.696
BAG BOY.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.294
"BAG BOY" ?

22:18.300 --> 22:21.827
I AM ASSISTANT MANAGER
OF ORGANIC PRODUCE

22:21.830 --> 22:24.253
AT THE HIGHEST VOLUME
FOOD CO-OP IN SEATTLE.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.023
JESUS, PULL YOUR DICKS OUT
AND MEASURE THEM,

22:26.030 --> 22:28.248
LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH !

22:28.260 --> 22:30.399
WHAT WERE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO,

22:30.400 --> 22:32.595
JUST TH ROW DAD
IN THE BACK OF CLAIRE'S CAR ?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.352
IT IS A HEARSE !

22:34.360 --> 22:36.499
YEAH, HI,
IT'S DAVID FISHER.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.822
YEAH, SO I NEED TO COME
PICK UP THE BODY.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.396
( ghost )
Know you not
the family of the man

22:46.100 --> 22:48.591
from dawn to dark
these many years ?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.659
( Scrooge )
They appear
to be so happy...

22:50.660 --> 22:52.196
I MADE YOU
SOME DINNER.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.760
I'M SO
NOT HUNGRY.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.625
WE HAVE TO EAT,
CLAIRE.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.655
WE DIDN'T DIE.

23:04.630 --> 23:07.349
brother,
Tiny Tim.

23:16.930 --> 23:19.455
ON THREE,
ONE, TWO, THREE.

23:36.430 --> 23:38.250
REALLY SORRY, MAN.

23:38.260 --> 23:40.319
THAN KS.

23:51.660 --> 23:55.494
( male )
FOR A BODY THAT'S FIRM
YET FLEXIBLE,

23:55.500 --> 23:58.719
FOR SKIN THAT
BEGS TO BE TOUCHED.

23:58.730 --> 24:03.190
FOR THE VELVETY APPEARANCE
OF ACTUAL LIVING TISSUE,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.395
TOP MORTICIANS RELY

24:05.400 --> 24:08.597

EMBALMING FLUID.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.249
LIVING SPLENDOR...

25:03.060 --> 25:05.790
HEY, BUDDY BOY.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.519
COME ON IN,
IT'S OKAY.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.997
SAY HELLO
TO MR. BLOOMBERG.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.925
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF, NATE.

25:17.930 --> 25:20.228
MR. BLOOMBERG'S DEAD.

25:20.230 --> 25:22.551
AND I'M GETTING HIM READY
SO HIS FAMILY CAN SEE HIM

25:22.560 --> 25:24.289
FOR THE LAST TIME,
AND SAY GOODBYE TO HIM.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.097
IT'LL MAKE THEM
FEEL BETTER.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.319
THAT'S WHAT
DADDY DOES.

25:29.330 --> 25:32.128
WHAT DO YOU GOT ?

25:32.130 --> 25:34.098
BANG !

25:34.100 --> 25:36.660
OH !
YOU GOT ME.

25:39.030 --> 25:41.453
YOU CAN TOUCH HIM
IF YOU WEAR ONE OF THESE.

25:41.460 --> 25:44.395
BELIEVE ME,
HE WON'T MIND.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.356
HE WON'T CARE.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.197
NATE !

25:58.200 --> 26:00.657
WHAZZUP ?

26:05.030 --> 26:06.349
HEY, RICO.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.497
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.229
OOH.

26:09.230 --> 26:11.357
REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAD, MAN.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.591
BUT WHEN YOUR
TIME'S UP, IT'S UP, RIGHT ?

26:14.600 --> 26:16.659
( David )
HOW'S HE DOING ?

26:16.660 --> 26:20.391
SO FAR SO GOOD.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.424
I REALLY APPRECIATE

26:21.430 --> 26:23.227
YOU COMING IN
ON CHRISTMAS EVE, FEDERICO.

26:23.230 --> 26:25.528
IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO FOR MR. F,

26:25.530 --> 26:27.452
EVERYTHING
HE DID FOR ME.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.098
I WAS GONNA BE UP
ALL NIGHT ANYWAY,

26:29.100 --> 26:30.954
PUTTING TOGETHER
ALL THIS USELESS SHIT

26:30.960 --> 26:33.019
SANTA CLAUS IS BRINGING
MY KID, YOU KNOW ?

26:33.030 --> 26:35.021
WE DON'T USE THAT
KIND OF LANGUAGE IN HERE.

26:35.030 --> 26:36.998
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

26:42.630 --> 26:44.222
YOU NEED SOMETHING ?

26:44.230 --> 26:45.959
UH, NO.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.450
I JUST--

26:47.460 --> 26:49.155

26:49.860 --> 26:50.952
DAVID FISHER.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.599
HEY, LISTEN,
I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU,

26:53.600 --> 26:56.228
DON'T EAT TOO MUCH WITH
YOUR FAMILY TONIGHT, ALRIGHT ?

26:56.230 --> 26:58.892
'CAUSE I AM MAKING YOU
SOMETHING TOTALLY DECADENT

26:58.900 --> 27:00.458
AND FATTY
FOR DESSERT...

27:00.460 --> 27:03.520
HOLD JUST
A SECOND, PLEASE.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.397
HI.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.949
Keith, I'm sorry,
I can't make it.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.349
WHY NOT ?

27:19.360 --> 27:22.557
BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS JUST
KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.755
OH, SHIT, DAVID,
I'M SO SORRY.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.625
Whathdo?

27:26.630 --> 27:29.793
NOTHING, THANKS,
BUT I HAVE TO STAY HERE.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.156
LISTEN, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
DON'T HESITATE TO CALL ME.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.594
Sure.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.228
I MEAN IT, DAVID.

27:38.230 --> 27:41.051
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.893
I GOTTA GO.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.197
OKAY, HERE IT GOES.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.753
THIS IS THE ONE
I'M MOST PROUD OF.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.058
THE HUSBAND,
OKAY ?

27:55.060 --> 27:57.699
HE GOT FIRED,
FLIPPED OUT,

27:57.700 --> 27:59.998
SHOT HIS WIFE
POINT BLANK IN THE HEAD,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.298
THEN TURNED IT AROUND
AND SHOT HIMSELF IN THE MOUTH.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.325
SOME SERIOUSLY
CLOSED CASKET SHIT, RIGHT ?

28:04.330 --> 28:06.025
NOW LOOK AT THIS.

28:06.030 --> 28:07.224
HUH ?

28:07.230 --> 28:11.018
LIKE THE BRIDE AND GROOM
ON TOP OF A CAKE.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.325
AND THEN
WE CREMATED 'EM.

28:15.330 --> 28:18.049
WHAT A FUCKIN' WASTE.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.255
OH...

28:20.260 --> 28:22.751
ACTUALLY...

28:22.760 --> 28:25.923
THIS RIGHT HERE IS,
THIS IS MY BEST WORK.

28:25.930 --> 28:30.458
WAIT A MINUTE,
THIS KID WAS BORN
JUST LIKE LAST MONTH.

28:30.460 --> 28:34.351
HE'LL BE FOUR FUCKING
YEARS OLD IN APRIL,
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ?

28:34.360 --> 28:36.157
OH...

28:36.160 --> 28:38.890
VAN ESSA'S
PREGNANT AGAIN.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.119
YOU STUD !

28:42.130 --> 28:45.293
( Federico )
IT WASN'T PLANNED,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

28:45.300 --> 28:47.427
NEITHER WAS
THIS ONE,

28:47.430 --> 28:49.955
AND HE'S THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.920
KEEP AN EYE ON
THOSE CHEMICALS, FEDERICO,

28:52.930 --> 28:55.148
WE DON'T
WANT HIM TO BURN.

29:09.460 --> 29:11.018
HEY.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.919
WHERE'S MOM ?

29:14.930 --> 29:16.693
SHE WENT TO BED.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.192
WAS SHE FEELING
ANY BETTER ?

29:20.200 --> 29:23.727
YEAH, NATE, SHE WAS ON TOP
OF THE GODDAMN WORLD.

29:30.130 --> 29:32.098
WHERE'S DAVID ?

29:32.100 --> 29:34.352
HE'S DOWNSTAIRS
WORKING.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.419
ON DAD ?

29:36.430 --> 29:39.797
YEAH, WELL,
HIM AND RICO.

29:43.460 --> 29:45.348
HE SAID NOT TO
WAIT UP FOR HIM,

29:45.360 --> 29:46.952
WE SHOULD JUST TRY
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.520
YEAH, AS IF THAT WERE
A VIABLE OPTION.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.689
YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE GROCERY STORE ?

30:13.700 --> 30:16.498
YES, ANYTHING
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.220
( phone )

30:38.660 --> 30:40.059
HELLO ?

30:40.060 --> 30:43.791
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TO START
RAINING FROGS HERE.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.756
HOW ARE THINGS
ON YOUR END ?

30:45.760 --> 30:47.227
GOD, I'M GLAD
YOU CALLED.

30:47.230 --> 30:48.549
Really, why ?

30:48.560 --> 30:51.597
I DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU, UH...

30:51.600 --> 30:53.898
YOU HAVE
A CALMING EFFECT ON ME.

30:53.900 --> 30:55.629
UH-HUH.

30:55.630 --> 30:59.122
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM
PROJECTION ?

30:59.130 --> 31:01.553
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM
"BLOW ME" ?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.858
Come on.

31:03.860 --> 31:06.192
You grew up with
all that psycho-babble.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.919
You rebelled against it
every chance you got, still do.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.488
And that includes

31:10.500 --> 31:12.923
HAVING SEX WITH STRANGERS
IN CLOSETS AT AIRPORTS.

31:12.930 --> 31:15.728
AND YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT EASY TO READ ?

31:15.730 --> 31:17.823
Coasting by on
your looks and charm

31:17.830 --> 31:19.559
isn't working
like it used to,

31:19.560 --> 31:21.949
but, you have no idea
what else to do,

31:21.960 --> 31:23.598
because you've never
had to learn.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.227
ANY WOMAN
WITH HALF A BRAIN

31:25.230 --> 31:26.857
LOOKS AT A GUY LIKE YOU
AND THINKS,

31:26.860 --> 31:29.954
GOOD FOR A HOT FUCK,
BUT BELIEVE ME, THAT'S IT.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.455
NATE, CAN WE GO HOME ?
I REALLY GOTTA TAKE A SHOWER.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.098
OH, GOD,
JESUS CHRIST,

31:43.100 --> 31:46.149
AM I NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE EVEN
A SINGLE MOMENT TO MYSELF ?!

31:48.060 --> 31:49.493
ARGH !

31:52.360 --> 31:53.622
OKAY.

31:53.630 --> 31:55.495
IT'S OKAY.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.650
WHAT CAN I DO ?

31:57.660 --> 32:01.096
NOTHING,
NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.655
YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY
FOR THAT CANTALOUPE.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.525
YOU FUCK OFF !

32:20.500 --> 32:23.424
( female )
SHE LOOKED HER BEST
EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE.

32:23.430 --> 32:27.355
DON'T LET ONE HORRIBLY
DISFIGURING ACCIDENT
CHANGE THAT.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.557
USE NEW WOUND FILLER
COSMETIC MOLDING PUTTY.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.290
NOW FASTER SETTING
AND SELF SEALING

32:33.300 --> 32:36.895
TO HELP MAKE MASKING
UNSIGHTLY WOUNDS A BREEZE.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.753
SHE SAID
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT

32:40.760 --> 32:44.594
SHE SAID, "TRUST ME, BABY,
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT"

32:44.600 --> 32:46.818
( loud music playing )

32:52.200 --> 32:53.519
( music shuts off)

32:53.530 --> 32:56.454
MA, REMEMBER THAT STUFFED DOG
I USED TO HAVE ?

32:56.460 --> 32:58.792
AND I DRAGGED IT AROUND
UNTIL ITS EARS FELL OFF,

32:58.800 --> 33:00.927
AND THEN YOU MADE NEW EARS
OUT OF A DISH TOWEL.

33:02.530 --> 33:04.851
AND I THREW IT
UP ON THE ROOF ?

33:04.860 --> 33:06.657
NO.

33:06.660 --> 33:09.390
AND THEN I WANTED IT BACK
AND I BEGGED DAD TO GO GET IT,

33:09.400 --> 33:11.197
BUT HE SAID NO,
IF I REALLY WANTED IT

33:11.200 --> 33:13.395
I'D NEVER HAVE THROWN IT
UP THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.152
YOUR FATHER DID SO MANY
WONDERFUL THINGS FOR YOU,

33:15.160 --> 33:17.196
AND THAT'S ALL YOU CAN
THINK OF RIGHT NOW ?

33:17.200 --> 33:20.021
WHAT, I JUST
REMEMBERED IT.

33:20.030 --> 33:22.157
HE WAS
A GOOD MAN !

33:27.300 --> 33:29.120
I'M GOING RUNNING.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.749
( door closing )

33:42.530 --> 33:45.090
OH, NO,
YOU'RE DOING ME ?

33:45.100 --> 33:47.352
YOU'RE THE WORST ONE
WE'VE GOT.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.896
THAN KS, DAD.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.253
WHERE'S FEDERICO ?

33:50.260 --> 33:52.421
IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING,
HE'S WITH HIS WIFE AND KID.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.624
HE'LL BE IN LATER.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.291
OOH, COULDN'T
THIS WAIT ?

33:55.300 --> 33:56.927
I DON'T WANT YOU
RUINING MY FACE.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.420
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

33:58.430 --> 33:59.454
NOT FUNNY.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.155
I NEED TO STAY BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.048
SO, GO REORGANIZE
SOME FILES

34:04.960 --> 34:06.552
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOOD AT.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.427
YOU NEVER REALLY HAD
ANY APTITUDE FOR THIS STUFF.

34:09.430 --> 34:11.125
I KNOW.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.724
AND WHAT DID
I DO WITH MY LIFE ?

34:13.730 --> 34:17.222
I WENT TO SCHOOL TO LEARN
EXACTLY HOW TO DO THIS STUFF.

34:17.230 --> 34:20.028
OTHER KIDS MY AGE
WERE GOING TO FRAT PARTIES,

34:20.030 --> 34:21.952
I WAS DRAINING CORPSES

34:21.960 --> 34:24.827
AND REFASHIONING
SEVERED EARS
OUT OF WAX.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.752
THANK GOD I DIDN'T
LOSE AN EAR.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.990
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'D DO WITH THAT.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.491
AND I DID IT
ALL FOR YOU.

34:31.500 --> 34:35.425
I DID IT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SONOFABITCH.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.727
UM, DAVE ?

34:41.160 --> 34:43.651
I JUST WANTED TO
LET YOU KNOW I WAS HERE.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.850
( horn honking )

36:05.630 --> 36:08.497
WE'LL DEAL YOU IN
NEXT HAND.

36:19.230 --> 36:22.358
( soft music playing )

36:38.360 --> 36:40.692
I'M ABOUT TO JUMP
OUT OF MY SKIN.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.997
DON'T.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.888
I'M JUST BARELY
HOLDING IT TOGETHER.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.197
ARE YOU
STILL HIGH ?

36:45.200 --> 36:47.020
I DON'T KNOW,
AM I SWEATING ?

36:47.030 --> 36:49.624
I KNOW I AM.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.528
THIS IS TOO
FUCKING WEIRD.

36:54.530 --> 36:55.929
IT'S BEEN
LIKE THREE DAYS

36:55.930 --> 36:57.727
AND I'M STILL TRAPPED
IN ZOMBIE WORLD.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.789
THIS IS ALL
HAPPENING TO YOU.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.392
FUCK OFF.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.198
SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE

37:04.200 --> 37:06.020
WHO WASN'T
PREPARED FOR THIS.

37:06.030 --> 37:07.827
I CAME HOME
EXPECTING TO SLEEP LATE

37:07.830 --> 37:09.752
AND CHOW DOWN ON MOM'S COOKING
FOR SIX DAYS.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.399
AND NOW I FIND MYSELF
FEELING LIKE...

37:12.400 --> 37:13.992
I'M NOT EVEN
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.252
I'D TRADE PLACES WITH YOU
IN HEARTBEAT.

37:16.260 --> 37:18.558
WHAT, AT LEAST
YOU GOT OUT OF HERE.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.892
I LIVE IN
A SHITTY APARTMENT

37:20.900 --> 37:22.595
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
TEMPORARY.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.624
I WORK AT A JOB,

37:23.630 --> 37:25.120
WHICH WAS ALSO
SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY,

37:25.130 --> 37:27.690
UNTIL I FIGURED OUT
WHAT I REALLY WANTED
TO DO WITH MY LIFE,

37:27.700 --> 37:29.156
WHICH APPARENTLY
IS NOTHING.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.627
I HAVE LOTS OF SEX

37:30.630 --> 37:31.995
BUT I HAVEN'T
HAD A RELATIONSHIP

37:32.000 --> 37:33.297
LAST MORE THAN
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.825
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE SELF DISCIPLINE
TO FLOSS DAILY.

37:35.830 --> 37:37.923
I'VE HAD FOUR
ROOT CANALS, FOUR !

37:37.930 --> 37:40.649
I'M 35, I'VE HAD
FOUR ROOT CANALS.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.154
I'M GONNA BE
ONE OF THOSE LOSERS

37:46.160 --> 37:49.027
WHO ENDS UP IN HIS DEATH BED
SAYING, "WHERE'D MY LIFE GO" ?

37:49.030 --> 37:50.395
NO, YOU WON'T.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.358
YOU'LL BE SAYING,
"WHERE THE HELL'S
THE MORPHINE ?"

37:54.030 --> 37:57.022
I'M JUST TRYING
TO CHEER YOU UP.

37:57.030 --> 37:59.294
I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE
FUCKING LIFE BEING CHEERFUL.

38:00.460 --> 38:02.496
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.025
BUT, HE'S IN A MUCH
BETTER PLACE NOW.

38:05.030 --> 38:07.351
YOU ARE SO RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.724
WHO THE HELL
IS THAT ?!

38:32.660 --> 38:35.356
I KNOW, RUTH.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.521
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

38:40.730 --> 38:43.028
I'VE KNOWN THE FISHERS
FOR YEARS FROM CHURCH.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.497
HMM.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.956
YOU KNOW THEM TOO.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.258
YES, YES,
I WORK HERE.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.727
OH, YOU WORK HERE.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.852
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE ?

39:01.860 --> 39:02.929
I JUST GOT OFF DUTY,

39:02.930 --> 39:05.125
I CAME TO PAY MY RESPECT S
TO YOUR FATHER.

39:05.130 --> 39:06.552
YOU'VE NEVER
EVEN MET MY FATHER.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.721
EXACTLY.

39:08.730 --> 39:11.028
AND YOU'VE MET MY PARENTS
HOW MANY TIMES NOW ?

39:11.030 --> 39:12.554
CHRIST, WE JUST SPENT
THE WEEKEND AT THEIR HOUSE.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.595
DON'T DO THIS
TO ME, KEITH.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.158
THIS IS NOT
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.491
I'M SORRY.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.922
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
FOR YOU TO BE POLITICAL.

39:17.930 --> 39:19.818
YOU THINK THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,
TO BE POLITICAL ?

39:19.830 --> 39:20.728
WOULD YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN ?

39:20.730 --> 39:22.721
WHAT IS THIS ?
WE CAN FUCK EACH OTHER

39:22.730 --> 39:24.595
BUT I CAN'T BE A SHOULDER
FOR YOU TO CRY ON ?

39:24.600 --> 39:25.498
I'M NOT CRYING.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.821
SO, WHAT AM I,
JUST SEX TO YOU ?

39:27.830 --> 39:29.422
JESUS !

39:29.430 --> 39:31.728
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION NOW ?

39:31.730 --> 39:33.595
SHIT.

39:33.600 --> 39:34.999
HERE COMES MY MOTHER.

39:36.630 --> 39:38.495
I'M SO TIRED.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.752
I KNOW, MOM,
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.058
IS SOMETHING
WRONG ?

39:43.060 --> 39:44.925
NO, NOTHING'S WRONG.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.750
THIS IS KEITH CHARLES,
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.625
HE CAME TO PAY
HIS RESPECT S TO DAD.

39:48.630 --> 39:50.222
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
MRS. FISHER.

39:50.230 --> 39:52.790
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.657
YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH A COP ?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.696
WE PLAY
RACQUETBALL TOGETHER.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.622
OH.

40:00.630 --> 40:03.190
NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.351
I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOUR FATHER NOW.

40:13.930 --> 40:16.057
WHO'S THAT COP ?

40:17.460 --> 40:19.553
MY AUNT SHIRLEY
WAS LAID OUT HERE.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.857
AUNT SHIRLEY, HUH ?

40:20.860 --> 40:22.999
SHIRLEY HAMILTON.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.150
TERRIBLE ACCIDENT,
LOST HER EAR.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.752
OH, YEAH.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.523
YEAH, I KNOW SHIRLEY,
I REMEMBER SHIRLEY.

40:28.530 --> 40:29.690
REALLY ?

40:29.700 --> 40:32.692
YES, YES, I WAS THE PERSON
WHO SEWED HER EAR BACK ON.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.419
THAT WAS ME,
THAT'S MY WORK.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.899
WHAT, SHE'S SAD,

40:49.900 --> 40:51.492
SO HE HAS TO GET HER
OUT OF SIGHT ?

40:51.500 --> 40:52.853
THEY ALWAYS DO THAT.

40:52.860 --> 40:54.293
THE SECOND SOMEONE
STARTS TO LOSE IT,

40:54.300 --> 40:55.995
THEY TAKE THEM OFF
INTO THAT ROOM.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.321
IT MAKES ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE
UNCOMFORTABLE, I GUESS.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.389
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
THE OTHER PEOPLE !

41:00.400 --> 41:02.823
VOLUME.

41:09.930 --> 41:12.558
WHEN I WENT BACKPACKING
THROUGH EUROPE
AFTER I QUIT SCHOOL,

41:12.560 --> 41:16.724
I WENT TO THIS ISLAND
OFF THE COAST OF SICILY,

41:16.730 --> 41:18.948
IT WAS THIS
VOLCANIC ISLAND.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.498
AND ON THE BOAT OVER,
THERE WAS THIS PINE BOX,

41:22.500 --> 41:26.391
SOMEBODY FROM THE ISLAND
WHO WAS BEING RETURNED
TO BE BURIED THERE.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.221
AND THERE ARE ALL THESE
OLD SICILIANS

41:29.230 --> 41:30.822
DRESSED UP
ALL IN BLACK,

41:30.830 --> 41:32.593
WAITING, JUST
LINED UP ON THE BEACH,

41:32.600 --> 41:34.522
AND, WHEN THEY GOT
THAT COFFIN TO THE BEACH,

41:34.530 --> 41:37.328
THOSE OLD SICILIAN WOMEN
JUST WENT APESHIT,

41:37.330 --> 41:38.957
SCREAMING, THROWING
THEMSELVES ON IT,

41:38.960 --> 41:40.723
BEATING THEIR CHESTS,
TEARING AT THEIR HAIR,

41:40.730 --> 41:42.322
MAKING ANIMAL NOISES.

41:42.330 --> 41:45.754
IT WAS JUST SO...
SO REAL.

41:45.760 --> 41:49.093
I MEAN, I'D BEEN AROUND
FUNERALS MY ENTIRE LIFE,

41:49.100 --> 41:52.126
BUT I HAD NEVER
SEEN SUCH GRIEF.

41:52.130 --> 41:55.224
AND AT THE TIME
IT GAVE ME THE CREEPS.

41:55.230 --> 42:00.122
BUT, NOW I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
SO MUCH MORE HEALTHY THAN...

42:02.800 --> 42:04.688
THIS.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.422
THAT COP IS HOT.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.128
( sobbing )
OH, DAVID, DAVID.

42:14.130 --> 42:15.597
I KNOW, MOM.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.421
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,
IT JUST TAKES TIME.

42:18.430 --> 42:20.455
I'VE DONE A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE THING.

42:20.460 --> 42:21.893
WHAT ?

42:21.900 --> 42:24.118
I'VE DONE
A TERRIBLE THING.

42:24.130 --> 42:25.290
HOW'S SHE DOING ?

42:25.300 --> 42:26.324
SHE'S FINE.

42:26.330 --> 42:28.696
I'M NOT FINE,
I'M A WHORE !

42:28.700 --> 42:31.589
I WAS UNFAITHFUL
TO YOUR FATHER FOR YEARS !

42:31.600 --> 42:34.091
AND NOW HE KNOWS,
HE KNOWS.

42:36.030 --> 42:37.520
UH...

42:37.530 --> 42:39.498
I MET A MAN
AT CHURCH ONCE

42:39.500 --> 42:41.559
WHEN YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T COME WITH ME.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.391
MOM...

42:43.400 --> 42:45.356
AND HE INVITED ME
FOR COFFEE.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.692
AND HE SAID
HE LIKED MY HAIR.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.999
HE'S A HAIRDRESSER,
A WIDOWER.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.299
WELL, THEY DIVORCED
BEFORE SHE DIED,

42:54.300 --> 42:56.996
SO TECHNICALLY
I GUESS HE'S DIVORCED.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.753
HE INVITED ME TO
ACCOMPANY HIM ON A HIKE.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.749
THIS IS REALLY
NOT THE TIME.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.649
MAYBE SHE NEEDS
TO JUST GET THIS OUT.

43:03.660 --> 43:04.957
WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.123
I USED TO LOVE HIKING
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
AND BEING OUTDOORS.

43:08.130 --> 43:10.325
I ALWAYS WANTED TO
TAKE YOU KIDS CAMPING,

43:10.330 --> 43:13.094
BUT YOUR FATHER WOULD NEVER
LEAVE THE BUSINESS !

43:13.100 --> 43:15.853
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU.

43:15.860 --> 43:20.524
I WENT CAMPING
WITH THIS MAN FROM CHURCH
SEVERAL TIMES !

43:20.530 --> 43:23.920
TOLD YOUR FATHER
I WAS VISITING MY SISTER.

43:23.930 --> 43:26.251
WHICH, IF HE'D EVER
THOUGHT TO CALL...

43:26.260 --> 43:28.296
CAN YOU EVEN BEGIN TO FATHOM
THE IMPROPRIETY OF THIS ?

43:28.300 --> 43:30.052
YOUR HUSBAND IS LYING
IN A CASKET OUT THERE.

43:30.060 --> 43:32.119
DAVID, SHE'S
GRIEF STRICKEN, OKAY ?

43:32.130 --> 43:32.824
FUCK PROPRIETY.

43:32.830 --> 43:35.128
WE DON'T
SAY THAT WORD !

43:45.730 --> 43:47.322
DID YOU KNOW HIM ?

43:47.330 --> 43:49.594
NO...

43:49.600 --> 43:51.249
DID YOU ?

43:51.260 --> 43:54.229
HE WAS MY FATHER.

43:54.230 --> 43:56.494
YOU'RE CLAIRE ?

43:56.500 --> 43:58.559
YEAH.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.720
KEITH CHARLES.

43:59.730 --> 44:01.698
I'M A FRIEND
OF YOUR BROTHER'S.

44:01.700 --> 44:02.951
OF NATE'S ?

44:02.960 --> 44:04.518
NO, DAVID'S.

44:04.530 --> 44:06.020
DAVID'S FRIENDS
WITH A COP ?

44:06.030 --> 44:08.225
WE PLAY
RACQUETBALL TOGETHER.

44:08.230 --> 44:09.857
DAVID PLAYS
RACQUETBALL ?

44:09.860 --> 44:11.748
( David )
EXCUSE us.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.991
YOU WANT ME TO CRY
ON YOUR SHOULDER ?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.321
FINE, MY MOTHER JUST CONFESSED
SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

44:19.330 --> 44:20.957
WOW.

44:20.960 --> 44:22.621
YEAH, WITH SOME
HAIRDRESSER,

44:22.630 --> 44:24.552
WHO LIKES TO HIKE.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.824
AND NOW FUCKING NATE
IS IN THERE PLAYING
MR. SENSITIVE WITH HER,

44:26.830 --> 44:28.627
WHILE HER DEAD HUSBAND
LIES IN THE NEXT ROOM.

44:28.630 --> 44:29.858
IT'S DISGUSTING.

44:29.860 --> 44:31.589
HEY, BREATHE.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.022
YOU'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

44:33.030 --> 44:34.019
OH, I KNOW.

44:34.030 --> 44:35.657
I'LL BE THE STRONG ONE,
THE STABLE ONE,

44:35.660 --> 44:37.696
THE DEPENDABLE ONE,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO.

44:37.700 --> 44:39.429
EVERYONE AROUND ME
WILL FALL APART

44:39.430 --> 44:41.159
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT THEY DO.

44:41.160 --> 44:44.789
HEY, DON'T YOU GET EXHAUSTED
BEING SO HARD ON EVERYONE ?

44:44.800 --> 44:46.051
AND YOURSELF ?

44:46.060 --> 44:47.925
OH, SHUT UP.

44:47.930 --> 44:50.649
SHE MET HIM AT CHURCH.

44:50.660 --> 44:52.651
YOU MET ME AT CHURCH.

44:58.630 --> 45:00.029
HAN DS.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.398
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
HOW LONELY I WAS,

45:12.400 --> 45:16.951
OR HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN SINCE
A MAN TOUCHED ME LIKE THAT.

45:20.260 --> 45:24.048
WELL, LONELINESS
IS A TERRIBLE THING.

45:24.060 --> 45:27.518
I'M STILL A WOMAN,
YOU KNOW.

45:27.530 --> 45:30.158
YES, I KNOW.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.129
AND NOW YOUR FATHER
SEES ME,

45:33.130 --> 45:36.759
LIKE GOD SEES ME.

45:36.760 --> 45:40.389
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.960
I'M SO ASHAMED.

45:46.130 --> 45:48.724
YOU DIDN'T DO IT
TO HURT ANYBODY.

45:48.730 --> 45:51.426
YOU WERE LONELY.

45:51.430 --> 45:53.398
I'M SURE DAD
FORGIVES YOU.

45:53.400 --> 45:56.119
AND GOD DOESN'T ?

45:56.130 --> 45:58.257
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

45:58.260 --> 46:00.751
I'M SURE
HE DOES TOO.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.256
LOOK, IT'S OKAY.

46:08.260 --> 46:11.127
EVERYBODY
FORGIVES EVERYBODY

46:11.130 --> 46:13.394
FOR EVERYTHING.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.152
( phone )

46:18.560 --> 46:21.222
( sobbing )

46:29.100 --> 46:30.556
FUCK.

46:38.330 --> 46:40.855
( sobbing )

46:48.060 --> 46:49.857
( clanging noises )

46:50.460 --> 46:52.792
( continued sobbing )

46:55.060 --> 46:56.618
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE OLIVES, HONEY,

46:56.630 --> 46:58.757
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.219
( sobbing )

47:07.300 --> 47:10.849
OH, SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE

47:10.860 --> 47:12.521
( male )
ASHES TO ASHES
AND DUST TO DUST,

47:12.530 --> 47:13.690
IT'S EASY AS PIE

47:13.700 --> 47:16.658
WITH FRANKLIN'S NEW
LEAK-PROOF EARTH DISPENSER.

47:16.660 --> 47:19.390
SAY GOODBYE TO
SOILED FINGERS FOREVER.

47:19.400 --> 47:22.289
ONLY FROM FRANKLIN
FUNERAL SUPPLIES.

47:22.300 --> 47:25.121
WE PUT THE FUN
BACK IN FUNERAL.

47:29.460 --> 47:32.327
( priest)
IN THE MIDST OF LIFE,
WE ARE IN DEATH.

47:32.330 --> 47:36.027
OF WHOM MAY WE SEE FOR SUCCOR,
BUT OF THEE, O LORD ?

47:36.030 --> 47:39.295
WHO FOR OUR SINS
ART JUSTLY DISPLEASED ?

47:39.300 --> 47:43.259
THOU KNOWEST, LORD,
THE SECRETS OF OUR HEARTS.

47:43.260 --> 47:46.627
SHUT NOT THY MERCIFUL EARS
TO OUR PRAYER

47:46.630 --> 47:51.158
BUT SPARE US LORD MOST HOLY,
O GOD, MOST MIGHTY.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.924
OH HOLY
AND MERCIFUL SAVIOR,

47:53.930 --> 47:56.899
THOU MOST WORTHY
JUDGE ETERNAL.

47:56.900 --> 48:00.392
SUFFER US NOT
AT OUR LAST HOUR.

48:00.400 --> 48:04.029
THROUGH ANY PAINS OF DEATH
TO FALL FROM THEE.

48:08.830 --> 48:11.151
IN THE SURE
AND CERTAIN HOPE

48:11.160 --> 48:13.594
OF THE RESURRECT ION
TO ETERNAL LIFE

48:13.600 --> 48:16.797
THROUGH ALMIGHTY GOD
WE COMMEND OUR BROTHER,

48:16.800 --> 48:19.257
NATHANIEL SAMUEL FISHER,

48:19.260 --> 48:22.593
AND WE COMMIT
HIS BODY TO THE GROUND.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.455
HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S SALTING POPCORN.

48:25.460 --> 48:27.553
EARTH TO EARTH,

48:27.560 --> 48:29.551
ASHES TO ASHES,

48:29.560 --> 48:31.755
DUST TO DUST.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.456
THE LORD BLESS HIM
AND KEEP HIM,

48:34.460 --> 48:37.054
THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE
TO SHINE UPON HIM

48:37.060 --> 48:38.948
AND BE GRACIOUS
UNTO HIM.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.849
THE LORD LIFT UP
HIS COUNTENANCE UPON HIM

48:41.860 --> 48:44.351
AND GIVE HIM PEACE.

49:13.360 --> 49:14.054
NATE ?

49:14.060 --> 49:15.721
NO!

49:15.730 --> 49:18.153
I REFUSE TO SANITIZE
THIS ANYMORE.

49:18.160 --> 49:20.697
THIS IS
HOW IT'S DONE.

49:20.700 --> 49:22.429
YEAH ?
WELL, IT'S WHACKED.

49:22.430 --> 49:24.728
WHAT IS THIS
STUPID SALT SHAKER ?

49:24.730 --> 49:27.426
WHAT IS THIS
HERMETICALLY SEALED BOX ?

49:27.430 --> 49:29.625
THIS PHONY ASTROTURF
AROUND THE GRAVE.

49:29.630 --> 49:31.825
JESUS, DAVID,
IT'S LIKE SURGERY.

49:31.830 --> 49:34.799
CLEAN, ANTISEPTIC,
BUSINESS.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.724
HE WAS OUR FATHER !

49:37.730 --> 49:39.197
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

49:39.200 --> 49:40.690
YOU CAN PUMP HIM
FULL OF CHEMICALS,

49:40.700 --> 49:42.327
YOU CAN
PUT MAKEUP ON HIM,

49:42.330 --> 49:45.026
AND YOU CAN PROP HIM UP
FOR A NAP IN THE SLUMBER ROOM,

49:45.030 --> 49:46.588
BUT THE FACT REMAINS,
DAVID,

49:46.600 --> 49:49.592
THAT THE ONLY FATHER
WE'RE EVER GONNA HAVE IS GONE !

49:49.600 --> 49:51.955
FOREVER.

49:51.960 --> 49:54.155
AND THAT SUCKS.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.991
BUT IT'S A GODDAMN
PART OF LIFE

49:56.000 --> 49:57.524
AND YOU CAN'T
REALLY ACCEPT IT

49:57.530 --> 49:59.748
WITHOUT GETTING
YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.091
WELL, I DO ACCEPT IT

50:01.100 --> 50:02.624
AND I INTEND TO HONOR
THE OLD BASTARD

50:02.630 --> 50:04.188
BY LETTING
THE WHOLE WORLD SEE

50:04.200 --> 50:06.054
JUST HOW FUCKED UP
AND SHITTY I FEEL

50:06.060 --> 50:08.722
THAT HE'S DEAD !

50:08.730 --> 50:10.357
GODDAMNIT !

50:12.500 --> 50:14.127
UH...

50:14.130 --> 50:15.529
AMEN.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.819
WAIT.

50:50.930 --> 50:52.727
LET HER.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.495
( sobbing )

51:25.930 --> 51:27.557
( priest)
LET US PRAY.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.791
OUR FATHER,
WHO ART IN HEAVEN,

51:30.800 --> 51:32.495
HALLOWED
BE THY NAME,

51:32.500 --> 51:35.822
THY KINGDOM COME,
THY WILL BE DONE,

51:35.830 --> 51:38.628
ON EARTH
AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

51:38.630 --> 51:41.224
GIVE US THIS DAY
OUR DAILY BREAD,

51:41.230 --> 51:43.425
FORGIVE US
OUR TRESPASSES.

51:43.430 --> 51:46.820
AS WE FORGIVE THOSE
WHO HAVE TRESPASSED AGAINST US.

51:46.830 --> 51:49.128
LEAD US NOT
INTO TEMPTATION,

51:49.130 --> 51:51.155
BUT DELIVER US
FROM EVIL.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.822
FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM
AND THE POWER

51:53.830 --> 51:56.526
AND THE GLORY
FOREVER AND EVER,

51:56.530 --> 51:57.599
AMEN.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.919
AMEN !

51:58.930 --> 52:00.557
AMEN !

52:00.560 --> 52:02.619
( priest)
THE LORD BE WITH YOU.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.254
MOM, FEDERICO'S GONNA
DRIVE YOU BACK, OKAY ?

52:13.260 --> 52:15.558
I JUST NEED TO GO OVER
A FEW DETAILS WITH NATE.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.323
WE'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

52:17.330 --> 52:19.321
PUT HER THERE,
MRS. F.

52:19.330 --> 52:23.255
YOU HAVE SUCH
DELICATE HANDS, FEDERICO.

52:23.260 --> 52:25.490
LIKE A STATUE.

52:25.500 --> 52:29.152
OR AN ILLUSTRATION
IN AN ANTIQUE BOOK.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.526
OR ONE OF THOSE
LI((LE CERAMIC HANDS

52:31.530 --> 52:33.896
THEY USE TO
DISPLAY GLOVES.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.397
YOU WANT TO BE
THE ALPHA DOG, NATE,
IS THAT IT ?

52:46.400 --> 52:49.790
COASTING TOWARD MID-LIFE
WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT

52:49.800 --> 52:51.529
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO COME BACK

52:51.530 --> 52:53.896
AND BE THE ROCK FOR
THIS FAMILY TO LEAN ON ?

52:53.900 --> 52:54.696
FUCK YOU.

52:54.700 --> 52:55.553
THAT IS NOT
WHAT I'M--

52:55.560 --> 52:57.448
YOU WANT TO
GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY ?

52:57.460 --> 52:59.223
YOU SANCTIMONIOUS
PRICK, TALK TO ME

52:59.230 --> 53:01.494
WHEN YOU'VE HAD TO STUFF
FORMALDEHYDE SOAKED COTTON

53:01.500 --> 53:04.025
UP YOUR FATHER'S ASS
SO HE DOESN'T LEAK.

53:04.030 --> 53:05.452
JESUS.

53:05.460 --> 53:06.859
YEAH, WELL,

53:06.860 --> 53:08.623
I'M SURE YOU JUST
WOULD'VE TOSSED HIM OUT
WITH THE GARBAGE.

53:08.630 --> 53:11.224
IT MAY SEEM
WEIRD TO YOU,

53:11.230 --> 53:15.018
BUT THERE IS A REASON BEHIND
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO HERE.

53:15.030 --> 53:16.054
WE PROVIDE PEOPLE

53:16.060 --> 53:18.893
WITH A VERY IMPORTANT
AND SACRED SERVICE

53:18.900 --> 53:20.993
AT THE DARKEST TIME
IN THEIR LIVES.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.798
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT TO
MAKE A SPECTACLE OF THEMSELVES.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.689
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY'D PREFER
TO GRIEVE IN PRIVATE.

53:26.700 --> 53:28.156
WHY ?!

53:28.160 --> 53:29.957
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
SUCH A SECRET ?

53:29.960 --> 53:32.155
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.196
DAVE, PLEASE--

53:34.200 --> 53:35.895
YOU KNOW NOTHING !

53:35.900 --> 53:38.027
NOTHING !

53:40.430 --> 53:43.820
YOU HAD A RESPONSIBILITY
TO THIS FAMILY

53:43.830 --> 53:47.994
AND YOU RAN AWAY FROM IT
AND YOU LEFT IT ALL FOR ME.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.924
WHOA, DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU'RE
NOT LIVING THE LIFE YOU WANT.

53:50.930 --> 53:53.398
THAT IS NOBODY'S FAULT
BUT YOUR OWN.

54:23.530 --> 54:25.293

54:50.800 --> 54:52.552

IN A SECOND.

54:52.560 --> 54:53.788
I DIDN'T HAVE TO
BE AFRAID OF IT,

54:53.800 --> 54:55.290
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT IT.

54:55.300 --> 54:57.052
NO MORE BULLSHIT.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.550
NO MORE
RESPONSIBILITY.

54:58.560 --> 55:00.323

SHOCK THERAPY.

55:40.960 --> 55:44.350
I'M JUST WAITING TO SEE IF
MY HMO COVERS IT.

55:46.430 --> 55:48.159
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH YOU ?

55:48.160 --> 55:51.425
OH, IT'S GREAT, GREAT.

55:51.430 --> 55:54.297
MY FATHER'S DEAD,
MY MOM'S A WHORE,

55:54.300 --> 55:55.551
MY BROTHER WANTS

55:55.560 --> 55:57.551
AND MY SISTER'S
SMOKING CRACK,

55:57.560 --> 55:59.528
I THINK I WIN.

55:59.530 --> 56:02.192
FOUR DAYS AGO I WAS
A RELATIVELY HAPPY GUY,

56:02.200 --> 56:05.294
AND NOW, IT'S LIKE I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO THAT GUY WAS.

56:12.030 --> 56:13.850
I'M A FUCKING MESS.

56:13.860 --> 56:16.249
IF YOU WANT TO
KNOW THE TRUTH.

56:16.260 --> 56:18.797
BUT, I THINK YOU'RE
ALREADY AWARE OF THAT.

56:24.230 --> 56:26.596
WELL, HERE'S
MY NUMBER.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.795
IF YOU EVER WANT TO,
I DON'T KNOW,

56:28.800 --> 56:31.496
GO OUT ON
A REAL DATE ?

56:31.500 --> 56:33.752
YOU KNOW, WHERE
YOU BUY ME DINNER

56:33.760 --> 56:35.751

56:39.800 --> 56:41.358
MAYBE I'M ONE
OF THOSE WOMEN

56:41.360 --> 56:43.590
THAT MEETS A MAN WHO SEEMS
EMOTIONALLY CON FLICT ED,

56:43.600 --> 56:45.329
NO RELATIONSHIP SKILLS
AND I FIGURE,

56:45.330 --> 56:47.525
"HEY, THAT'S FOR ME."

56:47.530 --> 56:49.623
I DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE,
I LIVE IN SEATTLE.

56:49.630 --> 56:51.154
SEE, THAT JUST MAKES
YOU MORE ATTRACTIVE.

56:51.160 --> 56:51.990

TO BE A SERIAL RAPIST.

56:56.600 --> 56:59.694
I'VE GOT 10 NURSES
BURIED UNDER MY HOUSE.

56:59.700 --> 57:02.419

NATE ?

59:27.400 --> 59:28.822

59:33.200 --> 59:35.122
UH...

59:38.160 --> 59:39.798

59:39.800 --> 59:41.256
I COULD MAKE
A FEW CALLS.

59:41.260 --> 59:43.524
THANK YOU.

59:43.530 --> 59:45.623
YEAH, SURE.

59:45.630 --> 59:48.326
JUST FOR
A FEW DAYS.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.220
OKAY.

1:00:35.930 --> 1:00:38.251
WAITING
AT THE STATION

1:00:41.930 --> 1:00:45.195
WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOVES

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.150
WAITING

1:00:53.330 --> 1:00:56.458

1:01:20.630 --> 1:01:23.849
WAITING
FOR THE BEE STINGS

1:01:26.730 --> 1:01:30.791
THEY TELL ME

1:01:32.830 --> 1:01:36.254
WAITING

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.828
WAITING THROUGH
YOUR WHOLE LIFE
