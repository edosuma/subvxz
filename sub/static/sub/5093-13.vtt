WEBVTT

00:04.757 --> 00:05.907
I'm not kidding here, folks.

00:06.609 --> 00:09.176
Mayor Cess Poole of
New York City

00:09.178 --> 00:12.096
and his tribe
of Rainbow Warriors

00:12.098 --> 00:14.431
are charging a white kid
with a hate crime.

00:14.433 --> 00:16.717
And you know
what that hate crime is?

00:16.719 --> 00:19.053
This white kid unwrapped
a ham sandwich

00:19.055 --> 00:22.272
in his cafeteria at school,
and a black Muslim kid

00:22.274 --> 00:24.525
was sitting at the table.

00:24.527 --> 00:27.394
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's what it's come to:

00:27.396 --> 00:30.614
a ham sandwich in the hands
of a white person

00:30.616 --> 00:33.067
is a weapon in a hate crime.

00:33.069 --> 00:35.519
So, you know
what we're going to do?

00:35.521 --> 00:37.571
We're going to take this show
to New York City,

00:37.573 --> 00:40.624
and we're going to take back
New York for white Americans.

00:40.626 --> 00:42.192
Turn it off.

00:42.194 --> 00:44.294
Say it with me: I want my U.S.A.

00:44.296 --> 00:46.163
Guy makes this stuff up.

00:46.165 --> 00:49.866
He takes a silly ACLU test case
from one of the charter schools

00:49.868 --> 00:52.369
and spins it
into a racist conspiracy.

00:52.371 --> 00:54.204
When's the circus come to town?

00:54.206 --> 00:56.890
Monday. The Strand Theatre
on 44th Street.

00:56.892 --> 00:58.375
Are all his permits in order?

00:58.377 --> 01:01.895
Yes. Granted to a holding
company called American Way.

01:01.897 --> 01:03.814
Which is why we had
no heads-up on this

01:03.816 --> 01:05.766
until a watchdog group
called it into my office

01:05.768 --> 01:06.900
first thing this morning.

01:06.902 --> 01:08.602
And, of course,
the watchdog group

01:08.604 --> 01:10.738
will want the word out
on our streets.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.823
Traffic, Bomb Squad and Patrol

01:12.825 --> 01:14.525
are all being
brought up to speed.

01:14.527 --> 01:16.610
He did a show from
Chicago last year,

01:16.612 --> 01:19.062
which resulted in a couple
of dozen arrests for assault

01:19.064 --> 01:21.115
and a fair amount
of property damage.

01:21.117 --> 01:24.901
Once upon a time, his
stink would've been

01:24.903 --> 01:27.621
contained by the reach
of his radio station.

01:27.623 --> 01:29.239
Not anymore.

01:29.241 --> 01:31.375
Damn Internet's a
blessing and a curse.

01:31.377 --> 01:33.127
Can I quote you on that?

01:33.129 --> 01:36.046
<i>Senior Living</i> is hounding me
for a sound bite.

01:40.585 --> 01:41.918
What's the good news?

01:41.920 --> 01:43.587
Who said there was good news?

01:43.589 --> 01:45.472
If I ask for a jelly doughnut,
would you say,

01:45.474 --> 01:46.940
"Who said there's
a jelly doughnut?" No...

01:46.942 --> 01:48.475
I'll go find some.

01:48.477 --> 01:50.694
Thank you.

01:55.817 --> 01:58.569
What I know is she just
got moved down here

01:58.571 --> 02:00.454
from riding a
desk in Vice.

02:00.456 --> 02:02.539
There's lots of eyes
on her from higher up.

02:02.541 --> 02:03.991
Mm. Not bad.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.075
No.

02:05.077 --> 02:07.327
I don't mean because
of her looks though.

02:07.329 --> 02:08.662
Oh, she's a lot easier
on the eyes

02:08.663 --> 02:09.997
than, say, you or me.
Mm-hmm.

02:09.999 --> 02:10.997
Especially you.

02:12.635 --> 02:15.452
So, what we got is
a newly-minted detective

02:15.454 --> 02:17.137
with very little street-time
under her belt.

02:17.139 --> 02:18.889
Yeah, well, you know
what they say, Sarge:

02:18.891 --> 02:21.725
a detective shield
does not a detective make.

02:21.727 --> 02:23.093
Takes a village.
That's right.

02:23.095 --> 02:25.128
Which... is where you come in.

02:25.130 --> 02:28.298
So, go say hi
to your new partner.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.184
Oh, come on, Sarge.

02:30.186 --> 02:32.569
Why do I always get stuck
babysitting the new girls?

02:32.571 --> 02:34.738
Well, it's either her or me.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.441
Right.

02:40.595 --> 02:41.612
Detective.

02:41.614 --> 02:42.830
I'm Detective Reagan.

02:42.832 --> 02:44.748
Candice McElroy.
Good to me you, Detective.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.749
You, too.

02:45.751 --> 02:47.534
So, people call you Candy?

02:47.536 --> 02:51.088
Yeah, they do... once.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.673
Right.

02:52.675 --> 02:54.791
You got a brother
in the military?

02:55.927 --> 02:57.544
Picture.

02:57.546 --> 03:00.514
No, no, I'm an only child.

03:00.516 --> 03:01.932
Mm.

03:01.934 --> 03:03.600
Husband? Boyfriend?

03:06.671 --> 03:09.223
86th Airborne,
three tours in Afghanistan.

03:09.225 --> 03:10.724
Wow.

03:10.726 --> 03:12.976
Well, thank you
for your service, soldier.

03:12.978 --> 03:15.279
You're welcome.

03:15.281 --> 03:16.730
Marines.
Two tours in Fallujah.

03:16.732 --> 03:18.682
And thank you for yours.

03:20.652 --> 03:23.570
Sarge says we're going to
be riding together, so...

03:25.373 --> 03:26.907
People call me Mac.

03:26.909 --> 03:28.458
Nice to meet you, Mac.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.327
Welcome aboard.

03:32.915 --> 03:35.699
Now, I know we've promised
you all a performance

03:35.701 --> 03:37.834
by the incomparable Alicia Keys,

03:37.836 --> 03:40.387
but I just got
a message from her,

03:40.389 --> 03:42.923
and she ain't singing
for her supper

03:42.925 --> 03:46.143
unless all of our pledge goals
are met first.

03:48.264 --> 03:49.980
So, on the back
of your place cards,

03:49.982 --> 03:53.150
there's a handy little box,
in which you can write

03:53.152 --> 03:54.601
your pledge amount.

03:54.603 --> 03:56.403
And I beg you--

03:56.405 --> 04:00.190
and you know me,
I ain't too proud to beg--

04:00.192 --> 04:02.609
to please, please give.

04:02.611 --> 04:06.863
Give till it hurts,
so that so many...

04:06.865 --> 04:11.118
in need... can stop hurting.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.203
Thank you so much,
for all that you do,

04:13.205 --> 04:14.171
for being here tonight.

04:14.173 --> 04:15.372
Thank you.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.548
Hi. Hi. You're here again.

04:25.551 --> 04:28.635
Get your pens. Get your pens.

04:28.637 --> 04:30.771
Swap seats with
me for dessert?

04:30.773 --> 04:32.356
Yes, Goddess.

04:33.808 --> 04:36.760
Thank you.

04:36.762 --> 04:38.528
"Goddess"?

04:38.530 --> 04:41.365
Yeah, sarcastic nickname
from my childhood.

04:41.367 --> 04:43.650
The more I complained,
the more I got it, so...

04:43.652 --> 04:44.952
finally I gave up.

04:44.954 --> 04:47.287
Anyway, are you
having fun yet?

04:47.289 --> 04:49.156
It's lovely.
Thank you for inviting me.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.657
Not at all.

04:50.659 --> 04:53.594
And do you know that Stephen
is not only that good-looking,

04:53.596 --> 04:57.247
but he's a top heart specialist
at Columbia Presbyterian.

04:57.249 --> 04:59.383
And single.
And single.

04:59.385 --> 05:01.585
And, and, and not gay.

05:02.554 --> 05:03.920
All right, what do I owe you?

05:03.922 --> 05:07.057
Your presence is my present.

05:07.059 --> 05:08.091
You're so full of it.

05:09.395 --> 05:12.312
Okay, but you asked.

05:12.314 --> 05:13.764
I would like you to join

05:13.766 --> 05:15.482
the City of Courage
board of directors

05:15.484 --> 05:19.569
and the board for the Harlem
Youth Outreach Program.

05:21.305 --> 05:24.024
Sophia, y-you know
I don't have anything like

05:24.026 --> 05:25.659
the deep pockets you need for...

05:25.661 --> 05:28.412
Oh, no, no, no.
You have a wide network.

05:28.414 --> 05:31.415
You would make
a fantastic fundraiser,

05:31.417 --> 05:34.317
and you'd be a tremendous asset
at any given table.

05:34.319 --> 05:36.703
As an extra woman?

05:36.705 --> 05:38.655
As an essential woman.

05:38.657 --> 05:41.958
Now, I have watched you all
the way through law school.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.828
I would say you remind me of me,
but those things

05:44.830 --> 05:46.346
tend to backfire on people.

05:46.348 --> 05:48.665
I would be flattered to be
compared to you.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.183
All right, then you are me.

05:50.185 --> 05:51.835
You're just Irish,
a little bit taller,

05:51.837 --> 05:53.503
and, uh, not so nudgy.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:07.201 --> 06:08.568
Okay, why don't you just go.

06:08.570 --> 06:10.570
No, no, no, I'm fine.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.958
Now we just ask, what would
Jackie O do in this situation?

06:16.661 --> 06:18.245
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
please, please!

06:18.247 --> 06:19.880
They are more scared of us
than we are of them!

06:19.882 --> 06:21.965
Go out to the lobby,
I'll meet you there.

06:21.967 --> 06:25.085
But, please, bring your
name cards to the lobby

06:25.087 --> 06:27.704
and we will meet there!

06:35.713 --> 06:38.482
Sir? Sir, can you understand me?

06:38.484 --> 06:41.017
Look, do you have any idea
who did this to you?

06:41.019 --> 06:42.319
No.

06:42.321 --> 06:43.236
All right, go on.

06:43.238 --> 06:44.387
Get him out of here.
Yes, sir.

06:44.389 --> 06:45.939
Reagan, we got a witness.

06:45.941 --> 06:48.325
This is Mr. Sands.
Mr. Sands.

06:48.327 --> 06:50.243
Did you see what happened?

06:50.245 --> 06:53.246
Well, I saw a car pull up and
just throw that poor man out,

06:53.248 --> 06:54.414
and then I called 911.

06:54.416 --> 06:55.916
Okay, uh, what kind of car?

06:55.918 --> 06:57.334
Did you get
a license plate number?

06:57.336 --> 07:00.704
It was the kind of car
that airport rental people

07:00.706 --> 07:01.838
call mid-size.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.039
Uh-huh.
Beige or taupe.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.407
I was a little

07:04.409 --> 07:06.242
too freaked to memorize
the license plate.

07:06.244 --> 07:07.461
Okay, understandable.

07:07.463 --> 07:08.462
Detectives.

07:08.464 --> 07:09.796
We found this when we cut away

07:09.798 --> 07:11.014
the victim's pants.
Oh, my God.

07:11.016 --> 07:12.716
You found that
in his pants?

07:12.718 --> 07:13.683
Yep.

07:13.685 --> 07:15.051
Some kind of mob message?

07:15.053 --> 07:16.753
Or a union beef.

07:16.755 --> 07:18.755
Oh, that's disgusting.
How do you think he feels?

07:18.757 --> 07:20.357
He was in some guy's pants.

07:20.359 --> 07:22.109
Uh, the deceased here,

07:22.111 --> 07:23.860
did he have
any identification on him?

07:23.862 --> 07:25.762
No.
No.

07:25.764 --> 07:26.813
Any last words?

07:26.815 --> 07:27.931
Oh, man.

07:27.933 --> 07:29.098
I'm just saying.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.534
You people
are terrible.

07:30.536 --> 07:31.568
No, Mr. Sands,

07:31.570 --> 07:33.120
it's a coping mechanism.

07:33.122 --> 07:34.988
It's how we cope
with loss around here.

07:34.990 --> 07:37.491
Um, we should probably get
a picture of the deceased.

07:37.493 --> 07:38.909
Yeah.
Okay.

07:38.911 --> 07:40.710
Okay.

07:40.712 --> 07:42.295
Say "cheese."

07:42.297 --> 07:43.914
Cheese.

08:16.172 --> 08:18.306
Okay, boys, one at a time.

08:18.308 --> 08:19.640
Congressman.

08:19.642 --> 08:20.975
The newspaper <i>Dia Noticias</i>

08:20.977 --> 08:22.894
is out this morning
with transcripts

08:22.896 --> 08:24.829
of this Curtis Swint's
vicious attacks

08:24.831 --> 08:26.063
against the Latino population.

08:26.065 --> 08:27.448
Including the
time and address

08:27.450 --> 08:29.400
of his New York
appearance.

08:29.402 --> 08:30.568
Of course.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.153
Providing free
publicity and playing

08:32.155 --> 08:33.520
right into his hands.

08:33.522 --> 08:35.172
I'd call it
more like alerting them

08:35.174 --> 08:36.440
to this monster
coming to town.

08:36.442 --> 08:38.626
Then get the word out for
your people to ignore him.

08:38.628 --> 08:40.628
To what end? Apathy?

08:40.630 --> 08:41.695
No, to avoid a
confrontation.

08:41.697 --> 08:43.881
Which is bound to play

08:43.883 --> 08:45.666
like the worst aspects of
the Puerto Rican Day parade.

08:45.668 --> 08:47.802
This is leadership?
Frank, please.

08:47.804 --> 08:49.887
No, it's common sense.
No, it's caving in.

08:49.889 --> 08:51.205
Oh, and how is that?

08:51.207 --> 08:53.758
Did Reverend King affect change
by staying home? No.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.810
He took the people
to the streets.

08:55.812 --> 08:57.845
Reverend Potter,
you are not Dr. King.

08:57.847 --> 08:59.513
And Swint doesn't
represent any force of law.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.399
He's a talk show host.

09:01.401 --> 09:02.650
And Hitler was a bureaucrat.

09:02.652 --> 09:04.735
Oh, for God's sakes,
we're talking about

09:04.737 --> 09:05.937
free speech here.

09:05.939 --> 09:08.189
Gentlemen, let's just try
to stay on track.

09:08.191 --> 09:11.108
He calls you Mayor Cess Poole,
New York's Lawn Jockey.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.361
Rafael, I'm quite aware
of what Swint calls me.

09:13.363 --> 09:14.561
We found something.

09:14.563 --> 09:16.247
Thank you.

09:19.234 --> 09:21.252
Okay, there may be an option.

09:23.255 --> 09:25.873
The boiler inspection
at The Strand Theatre

09:25.875 --> 09:28.926
is overdue,
rendering the permits invalid.

09:28.928 --> 09:31.078
No harm, no foul.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.964
It wasn't meant to be.

09:34.383 --> 09:37.101
It is 8:30 Friday morning.

09:37.103 --> 09:39.053
Swint doesn't broadcast
until Monday.

09:39.055 --> 09:41.472
There is plenty of time
to get the boiler inspected.

09:41.474 --> 09:44.442
That is not the responsibility
of the mayor's office,

09:44.444 --> 09:45.893
or mine, or yours.

09:45.895 --> 09:49.196
All right, fellas,
I got real work to do.

09:49.198 --> 09:51.232
And what do you
think this is?

09:52.819 --> 09:54.235
Turn back the clock.

09:54.237 --> 09:56.704
Say it was Malcolm X
coming to town.

09:56.706 --> 09:59.623
Are we really the kind of men
who want to try

09:59.625 --> 10:03.044
and muzzle this guy
on a stupid technicality?

10:06.048 --> 10:08.115
Count me out.

10:12.888 --> 10:15.673
So, a man walks out of
a bar in Washington Heights.

10:15.675 --> 10:17.975
An hour later, he ends up
in the East Fifties

10:17.977 --> 10:20.561
with four broken bones
and a rat in his pants.

10:20.563 --> 10:22.730
Any idea how you got there?

10:22.732 --> 10:23.848
No.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.349
Any idea who
put you there?

10:25.351 --> 10:26.484
No.

10:26.486 --> 10:27.902
Okay, well, how about
you make the complaint

10:27.904 --> 10:29.737
so we can find out
who did it for you.

10:29.739 --> 10:32.156
I don't want any trouble.

10:32.158 --> 10:33.941
Jimmy, you've got
three broken ribs,

10:33.943 --> 10:36.477
a shattered kneecap and rat
bites on your stick and stones.

10:36.479 --> 10:38.279
What the hell
is your definition of trouble?

10:38.281 --> 10:39.480
Being a rat.

10:40.699 --> 10:42.033
Ah, the oath of silence.

10:42.035 --> 10:43.951
I didn't say I took
an oath of silence.

10:43.953 --> 10:45.703
Well, of course you didn't
take an oath.

10:45.705 --> 10:47.121
You're in beverage distribution,

10:47.123 --> 10:48.456
you're not in
La Cosa Nostra.

10:49.592 --> 10:51.425
Look, I really am sorry,
I got nothing to say.

10:51.427 --> 10:53.377
I talk to you, things will
only get worse for me.

10:53.379 --> 10:55.379
Excuse me.

10:57.215 --> 10:58.665
Jimmy, here's my number.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.001
And I'm going to find out
who did this to you,

11:01.003 --> 11:02.169
whether you like it or not.

11:02.171 --> 11:05.272
But I would
appreciate some help.

11:09.644 --> 11:11.362
Thanks for that. Bye.

11:11.364 --> 11:12.446
What'd you get?

11:12.448 --> 11:13.697
His record's clean,

11:13.699 --> 11:15.699
but the owner of the booze
distributor where he works

11:15.701 --> 11:17.184
lives on the block
where they dumped him.

11:17.186 --> 11:18.953
So it was a delivery
or a message.

11:18.955 --> 11:21.205
Yeah. He's the little guy
in something.

11:21.207 --> 11:23.157
Hate it when they stick it
to the little guy.

11:23.159 --> 11:24.875
Who's "they"?

11:24.877 --> 11:26.627
That's what we're
going to find out.

11:31.416 --> 11:33.334
Come in.

11:34.169 --> 11:35.419
Hello.

11:35.421 --> 11:36.703
Hi.

11:36.705 --> 11:38.839
Hey. I was just
down with the mayor.

11:38.841 --> 11:39.840
Were your ears burning?

11:39.842 --> 11:41.208
Oh, cut it out.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.227
And thank you for the totally
unnecessary flowers.

11:43.229 --> 11:45.179
Oh, everyone at
the dinner got them.

11:45.181 --> 11:47.214
It, uh, was my attempt
at damage control.

11:47.216 --> 11:48.315
Oh.

11:48.317 --> 11:50.317
Well, did you ever hear
about what happened?

11:50.319 --> 11:52.937
The police said
that a pipe

11:52.939 --> 11:54.822
in the basement of the building
next door burst

11:54.824 --> 11:57.274
and it sent all the rats
looking for new digs.

11:58.327 --> 11:59.326
Look, these are some

11:59.328 --> 12:00.661
financial disclosure forms.

12:00.663 --> 12:02.580
Just routine vetting
when you come on board,

12:02.582 --> 12:04.665
to make sure there's not
a conflict of interest.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.835
Okay. So this is
how it's done.

12:07.837 --> 12:09.036
How what's done?

12:09.038 --> 12:10.371
Giving me the paperwork

12:10.373 --> 12:12.072
before I've even said yes.

12:12.074 --> 12:14.508
Do you know how else
you remind me of me?

12:14.510 --> 12:16.927
Uh-oh. This isn't
gonna backfire?

12:16.929 --> 12:19.547
You know, I shortened my name
to Franza from Franzarotta.

12:19.549 --> 12:21.048
Of the restaurant Franzarotta's.

12:21.050 --> 12:24.084
My grandfather said that was
like a second home to him.

12:24.086 --> 12:26.637
My-my dad had
his bachelor party there.

12:26.639 --> 12:29.056
New York institution
for 75 years.

12:29.058 --> 12:32.309
I had Cardinal Spellman,
Joe Namath,

12:32.311 --> 12:35.396
and Frank Sinatra
at my first Holy Communion.

12:35.398 --> 12:37.531
Wow!

12:37.533 --> 12:40.234
Okay, so how else
do I remind you of you?

12:41.069 --> 12:43.204
You grew up like me.

12:43.206 --> 12:44.705
You're an only girl

12:44.707 --> 12:46.607
in an alpha-male
family business,

12:46.609 --> 12:48.409
so you were probably wondering
how the hell

12:48.411 --> 12:50.294
you were going to survive
without a penis.

12:50.296 --> 12:52.613
And then you were wondering
how you were going to

12:52.615 --> 12:54.281
strike out and invent yourself.

12:54.283 --> 12:55.282
Ring any bells?

12:55.284 --> 12:57.117
Loudly.

12:57.119 --> 12:58.619
Now, look,
raising money,

12:58.621 --> 13:00.087
even for worthy causes,
is a bitch.

13:00.089 --> 13:02.006
But I'll let you in
on a little secret.

13:02.008 --> 13:05.426
It is one of
the few areas

13:05.428 --> 13:07.178
where men will leave
women alone,

13:07.180 --> 13:10.064
because they know women
are superior at it.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.315
They do?

13:11.317 --> 13:13.817
Have you ever heard of
a Father Teresa?

13:15.104 --> 13:16.103
Anyway,

13:16.105 --> 13:17.521
I will leave you
with the forms.

13:17.523 --> 13:19.356
If you sign them,
I know I have a partner.

13:19.358 --> 13:23.644
Well, you kind of had me at
"What would Jackie O do?"

13:23.646 --> 13:25.362
That works every time.

13:25.364 --> 13:27.147
Okay.

13:33.788 --> 13:35.439
What do you want
me to say, Detective?

13:35.441 --> 13:37.658
Oh, I don't know.
The truth, maybe?

13:37.660 --> 13:39.460
Okay, truly, you're wasting
your time, and mine.

13:39.462 --> 13:40.761
We'll be the
judge of that.

13:40.763 --> 13:43.214
Come and look at
the citations on that wall.

13:43.216 --> 13:45.349
NYPD thank-yous up the wazoo.

13:45.351 --> 13:46.550
You think I mean disrespect?

13:46.552 --> 13:48.385
I got nothing but respect.

13:48.387 --> 13:51.021
Look, I got no idea why someone
would give Jimmy a beat-down.

13:51.023 --> 13:52.473
And I sure as hell
don't know

13:52.475 --> 13:53.891
why they dumped him
on my block.

13:53.893 --> 13:55.392
Okay, well, who has
a beef with you?

13:55.394 --> 13:57.478
Look, Reagan...

13:57.480 --> 13:59.863
Please. Call me
by my first name.

13:59.865 --> 14:01.398
Which is?
Detective.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.783
Ha-ha.

14:02.785 --> 14:05.786
Look, Jimmy heads up
my delivery team.

14:05.788 --> 14:08.822
Now, you know and I know
that nothing moves in this city

14:08.824 --> 14:10.291
without the rails
getting greased.

14:10.293 --> 14:12.710
Sounds like he got
himself into a jam,

14:12.712 --> 14:14.828
but the who or the what,
I have no idea.

14:14.830 --> 14:16.297
Come on, end of story.

14:16.299 --> 14:17.665
We buying this?
Nah.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.749
We're not
buying it.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.334
It's all I got to sell.

14:20.336 --> 14:21.302
Yep.

14:21.304 --> 14:23.170
I think Jimmy's
the little fish

14:23.172 --> 14:24.505
in something bigger.

14:24.507 --> 14:26.640
Well, you'd have
to ask him about that.

14:26.642 --> 14:28.809
Your men, they always
fuel your trucks

14:28.811 --> 14:30.177
from two-gallon cans?

14:30.179 --> 14:31.729
What?

14:33.315 --> 14:34.815
Hey!

14:34.817 --> 14:36.483
What are
you doing?

14:36.485 --> 14:37.384
Hey!

14:38.487 --> 14:39.653
Hold it!

14:41.523 --> 14:43.440
Hold it! Police!

14:43.442 --> 14:44.608
Hey!

14:44.610 --> 14:46.327
Open the door!

14:46.329 --> 14:47.695
Hold it!

14:47.697 --> 14:49.446
Reagan!
Stop the car!

14:49.448 --> 14:51.582
Stop the car
and open the door!

14:51.584 --> 14:53.617
Hey!

15:04.095 --> 15:05.212
Reagan.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.715
You okay?

15:16.815 --> 15:18.782
Yeah. Did you
get the plates?

15:18.784 --> 15:20.183
Yeah. I should
call a bus.

15:20.185 --> 15:21.334
No, I'm fine.

15:21.336 --> 15:22.569
But my raincoat's not.

15:22.571 --> 15:24.037
You can get
another raincoat.

15:24.039 --> 15:25.372
Oh, my wife
bought me that

15:25.374 --> 15:27.040
for my tenth
wedding anniversary.

15:27.042 --> 15:29.075
It's English;
I love that coat.

15:29.077 --> 15:30.577
Did you get the
make of the car?

15:30.579 --> 15:31.511
Taurus.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.363
Taurus, like
the kind of car

15:33.365 --> 15:34.981
an airport rental guy
would call "mid-size"?

15:34.983 --> 15:36.199
Like the dog
walker said?

15:36.201 --> 15:37.584
Yeah. Yeah.

15:37.586 --> 15:38.701
You know what?

15:38.703 --> 15:40.086
Call it in, run the
plates. Hey, you.

15:40.088 --> 15:41.371
All right.
Hey, you all right?

15:41.373 --> 15:42.672
Yeah, I'm
all right.

15:42.674 --> 15:44.090
And don't you dare tell
me you have no idea

15:44.092 --> 15:45.842
who you got a beef with.
All right, all right, look.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.010
I, uh...

15:47.845 --> 15:49.545
I got union
problems, okay?

15:49.547 --> 15:51.881
Oh. So it takes me almost
getting dragged to death

15:51.883 --> 15:53.149
for you to cooperate?

15:53.151 --> 15:54.734
Hey, I sic the cops
on a New York Local,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.519
next thing I got bottles
broken in every case

15:56.521 --> 15:57.854
and I can't get
my trash hauled.

15:59.241 --> 16:00.357
What's your
union problem?

16:00.359 --> 16:02.025
All right.

16:02.027 --> 16:05.862
We've always been
a non-union shop, right?

16:05.864 --> 16:07.163
Federated Hospitality.

16:07.165 --> 16:09.565
Every time
they elect a new head,

16:09.567 --> 16:11.418
they try to strong-arm us
into joining, okay?

16:11.420 --> 16:14.737
It's been going on since
my grandfather was here.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.239
Oh. Great.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.374
Kerosene.
I smell it.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.625
Terrific, terrific.

16:18.627 --> 16:20.293
I'm gonna have to replace
the tanks at least.

16:20.295 --> 16:21.428
You think it was union?

16:21.430 --> 16:23.546
Look, I don't
know, okay?

16:23.548 --> 16:25.548
And-and I'll deny
that I sent you.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.217
Look, I got a guy
in the hospital,

16:27.219 --> 16:29.469
I got two trucks out,
so if you'll excuse me,

16:29.471 --> 16:31.087
I got to salvage
my business.

16:31.089 --> 16:32.639
Yeah. You have
a good day.

16:32.641 --> 16:34.524
I got a name
and address on the plates.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.776
Good.
Let's go.

16:39.647 --> 16:41.531
Ten-hut!

16:41.533 --> 16:43.116
As you were.

16:47.955 --> 16:50.206
Gentlemen.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.108
Before we dive in,

16:52.110 --> 16:55.111
the event we are coordinating
this joint effort around

16:55.113 --> 16:56.630
is bound to give us

16:56.632 --> 16:58.581
some fluid situations
right up through

16:58.583 --> 17:01.167
Monday afternoon,
due to

17:01.169 --> 17:03.720
the incendiary nature of
Mr. Swint's rhetoric,

17:03.722 --> 17:06.789
the audience for it,
and the protestors

17:06.790 --> 17:09.425
which will inevitably gather
against it.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.060
I know some of you

17:11.063 --> 17:13.346
have mixed feelings
about your roles in this,

17:13.348 --> 17:14.647
and I can
appreciate that.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.816
But it is our job.

17:16.818 --> 17:20.153
Personal feelings,
leave them at home.

17:20.155 --> 17:21.988
We'll start

17:21.990 --> 17:23.022
with Transportation.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.441
Chief Sinclair.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.143
Thank you for that, sir.

17:27.145 --> 17:29.863
Because the event is happening
on a Monday afternoon,

17:29.865 --> 17:32.282
the adjacent Broadway theaters
are dark.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.950
So we can take
the two blocks

17:33.952 --> 17:35.835
east and west of the theater
with barricades.

17:35.837 --> 17:39.489
There'll be five units
on horseback, 12 on foot,

17:39.491 --> 17:40.523
stationed on
each block.

17:40.525 --> 17:41.708
Where's the mobile command
set up?

17:41.710 --> 17:43.677
Here.

17:43.679 --> 17:46.329
Well, let's move it
farther up the avenue.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.715
We may require
additional vehicles.

17:48.717 --> 17:49.883
Let's keep that space open.

17:49.885 --> 17:50.717
Yes, sir.

17:50.719 --> 17:53.303
Commissioner,
a word?

17:53.305 --> 17:55.105
Excuse me.

17:55.107 --> 17:56.639
Please. Sit.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.528
Swint's been calling,
asking for a meeting.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.480
I'm busy.
And I've been blowing him off,

18:03.482 --> 18:04.864
but now he's
downstairs.

18:06.233 --> 18:07.217
Why?

18:07.219 --> 18:08.735
To thank you, personally.

18:08.737 --> 18:09.953
I don't want his thanks.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.988
I just wanted
to check.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.656
Can't promise he won't
wait outside.

18:13.658 --> 18:15.075
You can use the garage exit.

18:15.077 --> 18:17.077
I'm not sneaking
around my own building.

18:17.079 --> 18:18.378
Got it.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.163
Wait a minute.

18:21.966 --> 18:24.134
Have him come back at 6:00.

18:24.969 --> 18:26.169
Frank?

18:26.171 --> 18:28.471
Maybe Mr. Swint can
save me some time

18:28.473 --> 18:31.057
by providing a threat assessment
on himself.

18:31.059 --> 18:32.926
That's actually a good idea.

18:32.928 --> 18:35.678
Every month or so,
I try to have one.

18:41.570 --> 18:44.821
Because if history
teaches us anything,

18:44.823 --> 18:47.723
something's up when you ask me
for cupcakes middle of the day,

18:47.725 --> 18:48.908
out of the blue.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.493
You know, there is such a thing

18:50.495 --> 18:52.529
as being too smart.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.565
I have been asked
to join the board

18:55.567 --> 18:57.250
of a couple charities.

18:58.085 --> 18:59.452
Okay.

18:59.454 --> 19:02.005
It would mean that I would
have even less free time

19:02.007 --> 19:03.757
than the little free time
I already have,

19:03.759 --> 19:07.293
but... they're
really good causes.

19:07.295 --> 19:09.546
And?
And...

19:09.548 --> 19:11.848
I'm torn.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.717
You know, in a few years,
you're gonna be off in college,

19:14.719 --> 19:17.387
and I'll have every night
of the week to fill.

19:17.389 --> 19:20.723
So I'm not sure that
now is the right time.

19:20.725 --> 19:22.742
But the opportunity is now.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.612
Yeah.

19:26.447 --> 19:28.031
What's in it for you?

19:28.033 --> 19:30.700
To do some good for my city.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.952
You already do that.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.239
Good that is not
just measured by

19:36.241 --> 19:39.993
the number of convictions
or length of sentences.

19:39.995 --> 19:42.078
But by...?

19:42.913 --> 19:46.216
Another definition for myself.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.501
I mean, I-I love

19:48.503 --> 19:51.337
being your mom,
but that tour is almost over.

19:51.339 --> 19:52.806
I'm nobody's wife.

19:52.808 --> 19:54.591
I'm...

20:00.898 --> 20:03.933
The woman who's asked me
on board is

20:03.935 --> 20:05.768
someone I've always admired.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.803
I...

20:07.805 --> 20:11.774
kind of like the seal
of approval coming from her.

20:14.695 --> 20:16.746
You should go for it, Mom.

20:17.981 --> 20:20.450
Congratulations.

20:26.323 --> 20:29.259
This Richie Tomlin
registered his car at a bar?

20:29.261 --> 20:32.328
Yeah, well, believe it or
not, it's not that unusual.

20:32.330 --> 20:35.665
It's kind of like the old-school
way of staying off the grid.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.268
Well, we've got a name
but not a face.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.136
How do you want to handle this?

20:40.138 --> 20:43.473
Think we should handle it
the way he would handle it:

20:43.475 --> 20:44.840
old-school.

20:56.403 --> 20:58.020
A vodka cranberry.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.909
Pit Stop.

21:02.911 --> 21:04.627
Uh, h-hold on, hold on.

21:04.629 --> 21:05.628
Hey, Richie?

21:05.630 --> 21:06.862
Yeah.
You here?

21:06.864 --> 21:08.248
Say who it is.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.883
Mr. Burberry.

21:10.651 --> 21:12.034
No.

21:12.036 --> 21:13.920
No, he's not here.
Okay.

21:13.922 --> 21:15.805
All right.

21:28.736 --> 21:30.520
It's that big guy.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.071
Wipe you out, Vinnie.
Yeah.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.222
Richie Tomlinson,
police.

21:33.224 --> 21:34.440
Why don't you put
the stick down,

21:34.442 --> 21:35.992
- get your hands on the table.
- Hey.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.493
Come on, I'm
shooting pool here!

21:37.495 --> 21:38.878
Get your hands
on the table!

21:38.880 --> 21:40.229
You know,
you got this wrong.

21:40.231 --> 21:41.698
I got nothing wrong.
You're under arrest.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.183
What the hell you
arresting me for?

21:44.185 --> 21:45.451
That was his favorite raincoat.

21:45.453 --> 21:46.836
She's a cop?

21:46.838 --> 21:48.171
Yep.

21:48.173 --> 21:50.373
She's cute.

21:55.679 --> 21:58.381
Mr. Swint, Commissioner Reagan,
Deputy Commissioner Moore.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.099
Hello.

22:02.753 --> 22:05.087
Please.

22:05.089 --> 22:07.106
I just wanted
the opportunity

22:07.108 --> 22:11.093
to thank you for showing us the
hospitality here in your city.

22:15.699 --> 22:17.200
It's not hospitality, sir.

22:17.202 --> 22:18.934
I'm just doing my job.

22:20.204 --> 22:22.405
Nevertheless,
it's my understanding

22:22.407 --> 22:24.407
that you personally saw to it
that the boiler

22:24.409 --> 22:26.326
in the theater basement
was duly inspected,

22:26.328 --> 22:28.211
so that our little show
could go on.

22:28.213 --> 22:30.112
That's not exactly accurate.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.799
Let's see where
that came from.

22:32.801 --> 22:34.950
Excuse me.

22:38.922 --> 22:39.955
Mr. Swint...

22:39.957 --> 22:41.224
Please, Curtis.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.394
Mr. Swint, please don't
mistake my regard

22:44.396 --> 22:47.063
for your First Amendment rights
as any kind

22:47.065 --> 22:49.816
of endorsement
of your positions.

22:49.818 --> 22:51.818
Mm.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.903
I brought you a gift, sir.

22:53.905 --> 22:56.689
I'm afraid I can't accept it.

22:56.691 --> 22:58.741
Although, I have been

22:58.743 --> 23:01.778
known to bend the rules
if it's something I like.

23:01.780 --> 23:02.812
I heard you like good scotch.

23:02.814 --> 23:05.365
I do like scotch.

23:05.367 --> 23:07.834
You can take it with you
when you leave.

23:07.836 --> 23:11.204
As you wish.

23:11.206 --> 23:14.173
I agreed to see you to find out
if you could help us

23:14.175 --> 23:15.541
with threat assessment.

23:15.543 --> 23:19.495
Well, we get the occasional
bomb threat in the studio.

23:19.497 --> 23:20.996
Always a hoax.

23:20.998 --> 23:24.550
Death threats, mostly lynchings,
but  I'm still here.

23:24.552 --> 23:27.036
The vilest imaginable
hate mail,

23:27.038 --> 23:29.338
but "sticks and stones"
as the saying goes.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.006
But that's out there in America.

23:31.008 --> 23:33.843
I really don't know
what to expect here in New York.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.312
You can expect safe passage,
courtesy of

23:36.314 --> 23:39.482
the finest police department
in the world.

23:40.567 --> 23:41.868
One question.

23:41.870 --> 23:44.070
Shoot.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.372
Which is the act?

23:46.374 --> 23:49.024
The Midwestern gentleman bid
in here

23:49.026 --> 23:51.461
or that horror show
on the radio?

23:53.782 --> 23:55.197
Neither.

23:55.199 --> 23:56.666
I'm just
an old-fashioned American

23:56.668 --> 23:58.968
trying to call attention
to the fact that this country

23:58.970 --> 24:01.203
we call home
is being stolen from us.

24:01.205 --> 24:03.890
Speaking of acts,

24:03.892 --> 24:05.641
yours must be a tough one.

24:05.643 --> 24:08.678
Not really-- what you see
is what you get.

24:08.680 --> 24:13.349
I see a white American
whose boss is a Negro radical,

24:13.351 --> 24:16.569
who tries to keep the streets
safe from a vicious rainbow

24:16.571 --> 24:19.054
of aliens
and homegrown half-breeds.

24:19.056 --> 24:21.074
All under the thumb
of a handful of Jews,

24:21.076 --> 24:24.527
whose true allegiance is
to Israel and their own wallets.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.863
And when they boast about
this great melting pot,

24:26.865 --> 24:28.781
you have to grin and salute.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.418
And that is one hell of an act.

24:32.420 --> 24:35.905
There's a part of you that
can't speak up for yourself.

24:35.907 --> 24:38.240
You don't have
to say it, Commissioner,

24:38.242 --> 24:41.060
but I know
you thank me, too.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.262
Good night.

25:02.566 --> 25:05.368
I got it.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.269
Your lawyer's on his
way down, Richie.

25:07.271 --> 25:09.906
In the meantime, uh, we're
searching your car for evidence

25:09.908 --> 25:11.574
in the assault on
one Jimmy DeLeo.

25:11.576 --> 25:14.794
You find any change under
the seat, you can keep it.

25:14.796 --> 25:15.912
It's on me.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.280
Look.

25:18.282 --> 25:19.832
We both been
here before, Richie,

25:19.834 --> 25:22.135
so how about we don't waste
each other's time, okay?

25:22.137 --> 25:25.588
Yeah, we've both been here, so
you know I wait for my lawyer.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.507
Look, I don't want you
for pouring kerosene

25:27.509 --> 25:28.841
in Greenwald's trucks.

25:28.843 --> 25:30.009
Good, 'cause I didn't do that.

25:30.011 --> 25:31.794
Maybe you didn't,
but you did drive.

25:31.796 --> 25:34.296
You also drove away with a
New York city detective snagged

25:34.298 --> 25:36.315
in the passenger door
of your car.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.351
Hey, I didn't notice
that you were a cop,

25:38.353 --> 25:40.019
and that you were snagged.

25:40.021 --> 25:43.072
What's your current
employment situation, Richie?

25:44.408 --> 25:47.944
I'm an independent consultant
serving as a liaison between

25:47.946 --> 25:49.946
the hospitality
service unions,

25:49.948 --> 25:52.415
the consumers and the vendors.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.250
Nice job memorizing that.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.484
Who pays your fees?

25:56.955 --> 25:58.838
Yeah?

26:01.341 --> 26:04.427
Eddie Krumfeldt.
Long time no see.

26:04.429 --> 26:06.179
Reagan.

26:06.181 --> 26:07.763
Richie.

26:07.765 --> 26:09.015
What do we got?

26:09.017 --> 26:11.350
Well, what we got here
is a magic moment

26:11.352 --> 26:12.935
for you and
your client.

26:12.937 --> 26:13.936
How is that?

26:13.938 --> 26:15.638
Well, we got a guy
I think Richie put

26:15.640 --> 26:17.890
in the hospital who won't swear
a complaint out against him.

26:17.892 --> 26:20.226
We also got a guy, Richie
vandalized his trucks,

26:20.228 --> 26:23.229
who wants no part of the police
in any of this, so again,

26:23.231 --> 26:24.730
no complaints filed.

26:24.732 --> 26:26.232
Last but not
least, we got me,

26:26.234 --> 26:29.785
who could charge Richie
with assaulting an officer,

26:29.787 --> 26:31.186
but hasn't done that yet.

26:31.188 --> 26:32.405
Do you understand
what I'm getting at?

26:32.407 --> 26:34.790
Yes, I do.

26:35.692 --> 26:37.460
What you got is

26:37.462 --> 26:39.695
between now and Monday, when
Richie goes before the judge,

26:39.697 --> 26:41.797
to decide exactly how
it is that you're gonna

26:41.799 --> 26:43.299
play out your
magic moment.

26:44.751 --> 26:47.336
Unless, of course,
you'd like to wet my beak now.

26:48.805 --> 26:51.674
I dropped your raincoat off
at my dry cleaners,

26:51.676 --> 26:53.509
and they're gonna
fix it by Thursday.

26:53.511 --> 26:54.760
That's very
kind of you.

26:54.762 --> 26:56.562
Not what I
meant though.

27:01.985 --> 27:04.070
All I got is the nickname.

27:04.072 --> 27:06.322
Whose nickname?
The nickname

27:06.324 --> 27:09.191
of the alleged person
that allegedly pays my fee.

27:09.193 --> 27:10.693
Okay, this
alleged person,

27:10.695 --> 27:12.161
do you know them?

27:12.163 --> 27:14.280
No, just the nickname.

27:14.282 --> 27:16.565
Have you ever witnessed
them committing a crime?

27:20.087 --> 27:22.088
Just a nickname for now.

27:22.090 --> 27:23.072
Hmm.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.124
Goddess.

27:25.126 --> 27:26.959
Goddess? A woman?

27:26.961 --> 27:28.261
Yeah, Goddess.

27:28.263 --> 27:29.845
Goddess-- I got it.

27:29.847 --> 27:30.630
Goddess.

27:30.632 --> 27:33.015
Thank you.

27:46.155 --> 27:47.706
And the First Amendment
guarantees

27:47.708 --> 27:49.624
that you have the right
to speak your mind

27:49.626 --> 27:51.359
in the place and manner
you see fit.

27:51.361 --> 27:52.444
Sort of.

27:52.446 --> 27:54.546
Well, it's more
than sort of, Grandpa.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.381
So, if I'm bored in math,
I can just say,

27:56.383 --> 27:58.366
"Hey, Teach,
I'm dying over here"?

27:58.368 --> 28:00.668
Yeah, you have that right.

28:00.670 --> 28:03.254
And then Teach has the right
to give you a week's worth

28:03.256 --> 28:05.373
of detention for being
such a knucklehead.

28:05.375 --> 28:06.841
I don't get it.

28:06.843 --> 28:08.393
Well, Sean, the First
Amendment doesn't cover

28:08.395 --> 28:10.095
the consequences,
just your right to speak up

28:10.097 --> 28:11.212
in the first place.

28:11.214 --> 28:12.347
You still have
to use your head.

28:12.349 --> 28:13.681
It's called exercising
good judgment.

28:13.683 --> 28:14.983
You see the difference, Sean?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.851
I still might try it.

28:16.853 --> 28:18.570
I'll tell you what,

28:18.572 --> 28:20.321
you try it, and I'm gonna
use some good judgment

28:20.323 --> 28:22.741
and exercise
my First Amendment right

28:22.743 --> 28:24.442
to crack you on your butt,
how's that?

28:24.444 --> 28:26.411
Wait, so this Swint
guy, he can just say

28:26.413 --> 28:28.113
all these horrible
things about everybody,

28:28.115 --> 28:31.065
and you have to just, like,
make sure the show goes on?

28:31.067 --> 28:32.567
In a nutshell, yes.

28:32.569 --> 28:34.619
Sure, 'cause
the nutcases also have rights.

28:34.621 --> 28:37.672
That's what makes
this country so great.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.591
And so incredibly confusing.

28:39.593 --> 28:42.910
I strongly disagree with
what you say, but I will defend

28:42.912 --> 28:44.546
to the death
your right to say it.

28:44.548 --> 28:46.931
French guy named
Voltaire said that, boys.

28:47.916 --> 28:50.051
Hear about the rats, Dad?

28:50.053 --> 28:52.470
What about the rats?
Ah, somebody set free

28:52.472 --> 28:54.522
a bunch of rats in
a fancy charity dinner

28:54.524 --> 28:56.307
on Thursday night.
Wait, I was there.

28:56.309 --> 28:57.758
You were there?
Whoa.

28:58.812 --> 28:59.778
Tell me about it.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.762
What do you mean
they set them free?

29:01.764 --> 29:03.598
We were told they came from
a flooded basement next door.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.116
Hmm, not what I heard.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.619
The detectives on the case said
it looked like sabotage.

29:07.621 --> 29:08.769
Somebody brought them in,
set them loose.

29:08.771 --> 29:09.821
What detectives?

29:09.823 --> 29:11.739
Jensen and his partner--
what's his name?

29:11.741 --> 29:13.941
Durang?
Yeah, anyway,

29:13.943 --> 29:15.627
word is it looks like
one of those charities

29:15.629 --> 29:17.111
that makes enemies by, you know,

29:17.113 --> 29:18.163
giving more to themselves.

29:18.165 --> 29:19.414
No, they're barking
up the wrong tree.

29:19.416 --> 29:20.882
Setting loose rats

29:20.884 --> 29:23.084
sounds like a union beef.
Yeah, maybe that's it.

29:23.086 --> 29:25.053
Was the dinner for
one of those charities

29:25.055 --> 29:27.305
you were asked to join?
Yeah, City of Courage.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.923
Any history of problems?

29:28.925 --> 29:30.225
Not that I know of.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.459
Want to help me clear?

29:31.461 --> 29:33.394
Sure.

29:36.932 --> 29:38.683
I got a case--

29:38.685 --> 29:41.802
a casualty in a war that
I don't really understand yet.

29:41.804 --> 29:45.990
Guy was found beaten up and
dumped with a rat in his pants.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.742
Late Thursday night,

29:47.744 --> 29:49.444
the same night the rats
crashed your party.

29:49.446 --> 29:50.978
So?

29:50.980 --> 29:52.697
So, somebody told you
that the rats came

29:52.699 --> 29:54.332
from the basement next door.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.151
But the cops think that
the rats were orchestrated.

29:57.153 --> 29:58.870
So, she had the
wrong information.

29:58.872 --> 29:59.871
Who is she?

29:59.873 --> 30:01.339
The woman who
invited me.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.157
And?

30:03.159 --> 30:05.126
And... nothing.

30:05.128 --> 30:07.545
Her name is Sophia Franza;
you can look her up.

30:07.547 --> 30:10.431
She's kind of famous in the
New York charity circles.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.167
I've known her on
and off for 20 years.

30:13.169 --> 30:14.686
All right. Maybe I'm reaching.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.638
I'm just trying
to make a connection here

30:16.640 --> 30:18.606
with the rats, that's all.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.341
Well, I can ask
her who told her

30:20.343 --> 30:22.227
about the rats coming
from next door.

30:22.229 --> 30:23.895
Thank you.

30:23.897 --> 30:24.896
Desert.

30:24.898 --> 30:26.364
Coming.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.032
One more thing.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.951
There was a nickname
popped up

30:29.953 --> 30:32.070
from a guy who I like
for a part in this.

30:32.072 --> 30:33.821
Um, Goddess.

30:33.823 --> 30:35.823
Does that ring
a bell at all?

30:35.825 --> 30:38.076
Not that I can think of.

30:38.078 --> 30:40.194
Well...

30:40.196 --> 30:41.246
You coming?

30:41.248 --> 30:43.414
Yeah.

30:53.375 --> 30:55.560
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.396
What the hell?

30:58.398 --> 30:59.731
Evening, Jimmy.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.600
We just came by to let you know
we have a surveillance tape

31:02.602 --> 31:04.852
of you with two crates
covered in table cloths,

31:04.854 --> 31:06.404
sneaking your little
petting zoo into that party,

31:06.406 --> 31:07.438
right through the back.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.439
It wasn't me.

31:08.441 --> 31:10.441
No, it was
definitely you, Jimmy.

31:10.443 --> 31:12.443
We just watched it.

31:12.445 --> 31:15.280
But... the investigating
detectives

31:15.282 --> 31:17.248
don't know who you are.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.449
Yet.

31:18.451 --> 31:21.452
So you're gonna
do us a favor.

31:21.454 --> 31:23.087
Who put you up to it?

31:24.173 --> 31:26.925
Get... get the damn light
out of my face.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.428
Look, Jimmy,
it's Sunday night, okay?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.463
And quite frankly,
I should be at home

31:32.465 --> 31:34.132
spending quality time
harassing my family

31:34.134 --> 31:36.434
instead of wasting it here
harassing you.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.085
So why don't you
start talking, okay?

31:38.087 --> 31:39.437
You'll protect me?

31:39.439 --> 31:42.140
Well, I think that depends
on what you tell us right now.

31:46.645 --> 31:49.280
We had a good thing going.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.450
My guys at the Port of Newark
would... load me up

31:52.452 --> 31:56.287
with palettes of wine and booze
they lifted from off-load.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.990
I'd take care of them,
sell the booze to the charities,

31:58.992 --> 32:00.441
they'd take care of me.

32:00.443 --> 32:02.744
Whoa, what-what charities
are you talking about?

32:02.746 --> 32:05.797
Uh... ones the Goddess

32:05.799 --> 32:07.114
has her finger in.

32:07.116 --> 32:08.416
That's what
they call her.

32:08.418 --> 32:11.052
I-I don't know her real name;
I never met her.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.670
She's real connected
on account her family's

32:12.672 --> 32:15.006
got a restaurant, what I heard.
All right.

32:15.008 --> 32:18.793
Word came down they're
cutting my end in half.

32:18.795 --> 32:21.346
So you tried to renegotiate
with a room full of rats?

32:21.348 --> 32:22.563
Something like that..

32:22.565 --> 32:24.565
Somebody tipped them off.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.434
I ended up here.

32:26.436 --> 32:28.186
What about, uh, Greenwald?

32:28.188 --> 32:29.604
Why sabotage his trucks?

32:29.606 --> 32:30.971
He in on it?
No.

32:30.973 --> 32:33.691
They must've thought he was,
but it was my deal.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.161
That's the story.

32:44.871 --> 32:46.537
Mother Teresa's

32:46.539 --> 32:49.374
given name, five letters,
ending in...

32:49.376 --> 32:50.291
Agnes.

32:50.293 --> 32:52.527
A-G-N-E-S. Thank you.

32:52.529 --> 32:54.879
You're welcome.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.185
Those who cannot
remember the past

33:01.187 --> 33:03.237
are condemned
to repeat it?

33:03.239 --> 33:05.223
George Santayana.
S-A-N-T-A...

33:05.225 --> 33:08.476
No, no, no, no, he's
not in the puzzle.

33:08.478 --> 33:11.195
I just see that you're hitting
your New York history.

33:14.149 --> 33:17.118
I got to protect this guy.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.653
Yeah, you do.

33:18.655 --> 33:20.488
Nowhere does it say

33:20.490 --> 33:23.524
I get to pick and choose
who gets First Amendment rights.

33:23.526 --> 33:24.492
I've checked.

33:24.494 --> 33:26.477
Could've told you that.

33:26.479 --> 33:28.496
But I also have
to represent

33:28.498 --> 33:31.249
the office I hold
and what it stands for.

33:31.251 --> 33:35.553
And what part of all this is
getting you so riled up?

33:35.555 --> 33:39.724
The part where I had him
up to my office.

33:39.726 --> 33:44.095
I felt like I had to take
a shower afterwards.

33:44.097 --> 33:47.732
When Teddy Roosevelt headed up
the Police Commission,

33:47.734 --> 33:49.767
an anti-Semitic
German academic booked

33:49.769 --> 33:52.236
a downtown hall
for one of his rants.

33:52.238 --> 33:56.023
You had a significant
Jewish population in this city,

33:56.025 --> 33:59.410
but also an immigrant German
faction that would come out

33:59.412 --> 34:03.063
in droves to hear the old ugly
songs from the Fatherland.

34:03.065 --> 34:05.232
Did Roosevelt stop him?

34:05.234 --> 34:06.751
No, he did not.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.570
He saw to it that the lecture
went off without a hitch

34:09.572 --> 34:11.172
and not a drop of blood spilled.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.306
How'd he do that?

34:16.746 --> 34:21.014
He must've found another way
to skin that particular cat.

34:36.335 --> 34:39.255
Look, I'm not saying
I got all my ducks lined up

34:39.257 --> 34:40.873
in a row here, sis,

34:40.875 --> 34:43.076
but both guys gave me
the same name: Goddess.

34:43.078 --> 34:44.342
Yeah, two lowlifes with
who-knows-what agenda,

34:44.344 --> 34:46.679
aimed at a woman with
really good weight on her side

34:46.681 --> 34:48.914
who's never had a single entry
on a rap sheet.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.099
Okay, that's all true.

34:50.101 --> 34:52.719
But I'm not paid
to drink the Kool-Aid here, sis.

34:52.721 --> 34:54.687
I am not drinking the Kool-Aid.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.922
Yes, you are. And I hope
for your sake you're right.

34:56.924 --> 34:58.307
But we're not gonna know
for sure until

34:58.309 --> 35:00.610
we drill down on this.
And how do we do that?

35:00.612 --> 35:03.896
Look, the guy who handed out
the beat-down, this Tomlinson,

35:03.898 --> 35:04.864
he's freelance muscle.

35:04.866 --> 35:07.116
He says he can I.D. Goddess.
He says.

35:07.118 --> 35:08.568
Yeah, he says!

35:08.570 --> 35:10.620
We're only gonna know if
he's telling the truth one way!

35:10.622 --> 35:12.622
- How?
- Okay, I'll be out in a minute.

35:12.624 --> 35:14.240
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute!

35:14.242 --> 35:15.441
Hey!

35:15.443 --> 35:17.877
Hi! It's a great party.

35:17.879 --> 35:19.495
Yeah, well, except
for the entree.

35:19.497 --> 35:21.998
I couldn't tell if it
was varmint or critter.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.950
Well, at least it wasn't running
around the room this time.

35:24.952 --> 35:27.553
There is that.

35:28.472 --> 35:30.973
Everything okay?

35:30.975 --> 35:32.759
Yeah.

35:32.761 --> 35:34.427
Having second thoughts?

35:34.429 --> 35:37.463
Not about coming aboard.

35:37.465 --> 35:39.265
But something.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.484
It can wait.

35:46.473 --> 35:48.974
Richie Tomlinson told me
that he dropped off a suitcase

35:48.976 --> 35:49.992
full of kickback cash

35:49.994 --> 35:51.744
to Goddess and her driver
sometime back,

35:51.746 --> 35:54.814
and that he got a good enough
look at her to I.D. her.

35:54.816 --> 35:56.999
Mm-hmm, and maybe they just
have another agenda here.

35:57.001 --> 35:59.619
Throw her under the bus
to throw you off case.

35:59.621 --> 36:01.337
No, no. Look, neither
DeLeo or Tomlinson

36:01.339 --> 36:04.090
can even spell "agenda,"
much less carry one out.

36:04.092 --> 36:07.260
Stupidity does not make
for a very good informant.

36:07.262 --> 36:09.212
Tomlinson confessed
to giving DeLeo the beat-down

36:09.214 --> 36:11.214
on orders of Goddess
and her crew,

36:11.216 --> 36:13.299
because DeLeo brought
all the rats to her party

36:13.301 --> 36:16.018
in an effort to renegotiate
his side deal.

36:16.020 --> 36:18.170
Look, I would show Tomlinson
a lineup of mug shots,

36:18.172 --> 36:20.139
but the Goddess doesn't have
a mug shot.

36:20.141 --> 36:21.440
So you want to do

36:21.442 --> 36:22.842
a live lineup?

36:22.844 --> 36:24.777
If Ms. Franza is
all you think she is,

36:24.779 --> 36:26.729
Tomlinson won't be able
to I.D. her,

36:26.731 --> 36:28.698
and she can go on her merry way.

36:29.616 --> 36:33.035
Or I may have been played
for a fool.

36:33.037 --> 36:35.872
Maybe she was a good person.

36:35.874 --> 36:38.407
Maybe she just got away
with so many little things

36:38.409 --> 36:41.410
for so long, now she thinks
she can get away with anything.

36:41.412 --> 36:44.714
And maybe you just got caught up
in her orbit at the wrong time.

36:47.417 --> 36:49.201
I got to get back to work.

36:49.203 --> 36:51.170
You'll let me know
the when and the where?

36:51.172 --> 36:52.588
Yeah.
All right.

37:08.689 --> 37:10.356
Thank you.

37:22.836 --> 37:23.870
Well?

37:23.872 --> 37:25.755
No, that ain't her.

37:25.757 --> 37:27.757
Okay.

37:35.766 --> 37:38.217
Hey. Hey.

37:38.219 --> 37:40.219
So sorry I'm late.
That's all right.

37:40.221 --> 37:41.354
She just played
kissy-kissy

37:41.356 --> 37:43.055
with the tall brunette
over there.

37:43.057 --> 37:45.141
You sure that's her?

37:45.143 --> 37:47.193
Yeah, that's Goddess.

37:50.430 --> 37:51.564
Okay, well.

37:53.201 --> 37:55.067
Excuse me.
Sure.

38:00.958 --> 38:03.042
Everything okay?

38:03.044 --> 38:05.878
Yes, Goddess.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.164
Oh, no, no, no,
not you, too, please.

38:08.166 --> 38:09.632
Stay put.

38:11.284 --> 38:13.836
When they say
charity starts at home,

38:13.838 --> 38:18.090
I guess you must have
misunderstood what that meant.

38:18.092 --> 38:21.477
Erin, I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:21.479 --> 38:22.962
I mean, how well can you eat?

38:22.964 --> 38:25.181
What do you really need
at this kind of price?

38:25.183 --> 38:27.800
Hey, what game is this?

38:27.802 --> 38:30.135
I guess when you squeeze people
a little too tight,

38:30.137 --> 38:31.437
they eventually pop.

38:33.473 --> 38:35.024
Hey, hey, hey,
I don't know

38:35.026 --> 38:37.410
what you think you've got,
but you think again.

38:37.412 --> 38:38.811
The good work

38:38.813 --> 38:41.580
that I do for
this city far outweighs

38:41.582 --> 38:44.700
any slander or innuendo that you
might've trumped up, Ms. Reagan.

38:44.702 --> 38:46.702
Son of a...

38:48.338 --> 38:49.455
Do I know you?

38:49.457 --> 38:51.507
No, but I know you.

38:54.495 --> 38:56.762
Who the hell are you?
Detective Reagan.

38:56.764 --> 38:58.347
Ms. Franza, you're under arrest
for extortion,

38:58.349 --> 39:00.433
accepting a bribe
and accessory to

39:00.435 --> 39:01.968
felony assault--
and that's just for appetizers.

39:01.970 --> 39:04.270
Please put your hands
behind your back, ma'am.

39:04.272 --> 39:05.221
You're framing me?

39:05.223 --> 39:07.390
Have you any idea
how much money

39:07.392 --> 39:08.891
I've raised for this city?!

39:08.893 --> 39:10.860
There are charities
in this city that wouldn't

39:10.862 --> 39:12.278
exist without my work!
Let's go.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.030
No, no! You are gonna be sorry!
Ma'am.

39:14.032 --> 39:15.731
Let's go, come on.
You don't want to do this.

39:15.733 --> 39:17.366
Get her out of here.
Come on.

39:17.368 --> 39:18.734
I already am.

39:41.308 --> 39:44.427
Checking.
One, two, three, check.

39:44.429 --> 39:47.379
One, two, three, check.

39:54.237 --> 39:56.272
What the...?

40:06.733 --> 40:08.367
Mr. Swint.

40:08.369 --> 40:09.785
This some kind of joke?

40:09.787 --> 40:10.953
On the contrary.

40:10.955 --> 40:13.639
This is a full complement
of my finest officers

40:13.641 --> 40:15.541
in service to your right
to peaceful assembly

40:15.543 --> 40:18.627
and free speech
in our fair city.

40:18.629 --> 40:21.180
I don't want them
or need them. Get out.

40:21.182 --> 40:24.683
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that, sir.

40:24.685 --> 40:26.936
See, the particulars
of your contract

40:26.938 --> 40:28.938
with the management
of this theater

40:28.940 --> 40:32.424
require an NYPD
security presence

40:32.426 --> 40:34.310
up to and during your broadcast.

40:34.312 --> 40:36.529
You're welcome.

40:39.317 --> 40:41.450
Proceed to your assigned posts.

40:44.821 --> 40:47.039
What?

40:47.041 --> 40:49.792
You dug up every mutt, mongrel

40:49.794 --> 40:52.912
and half-breed
to do it.

41:03.473 --> 41:05.257
This is Sergeant Spinner.

41:05.259 --> 41:07.226
Just by coincidence,
Sergeant Spinner was

41:07.228 --> 41:11.013
a blind-side tackle on your own
Kansas State Wildcats.

41:11.015 --> 41:12.181
Good for him!

41:12.183 --> 41:13.933
At your service, sir.

41:13.935 --> 41:16.435
Proceed to your post,
Sergeant.

41:27.030 --> 41:29.148
This is harassment,
plain and simple.

41:29.150 --> 41:31.117
No, sir,
it's just our New York way

41:31.119 --> 41:33.485
of saying, "Howdy, stranger."
