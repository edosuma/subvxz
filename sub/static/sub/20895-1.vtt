02:06.850 --> 02:08.330
I have to go.

02:26.570 --> 02:28.105
Here.

02:34.290 --> 02:36.350
Can I see you again?

02:36.930 --> 02:39.999
One telegram from the War Ministry is enough.

03:13.330 --> 03:14.480
Brandt.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.289
<i>What do you know about the Kaiser?</i>

03:20.290 --> 03:24.887
<i>Kaiser Wilhelm II,</i>
<i>former Emperor of the Fatherland.</i>

03:24.970 --> 03:27.280
<i>Weak leader. Poor strategist.</i>

03:27.370 --> 03:29.248
<i>Led us to defeat. Ran away afterwards.</i>

03:29.330 --> 03:31.322
- Exiled in Belgium, sir.
- Holland.

03:31.410 --> 03:34.801
- Is he still alive?
- Damn your ignorance, Captain.

03:34.890 --> 03:36.370
The Kaiser is absolutely still alive

03:36.450 --> 03:38.840
and remains of great symbolic importance
to the German people.

03:44.730 --> 03:49.448
You're to take immediate command of Kaiser
Wilhelm's military guard outside Utrecht.

03:49.530 --> 03:53.604
As of now, the safety of the Kaiser is
of prime concern to the <i>Reich,</i>

03:53.690 --> 03:57.001
and, therefore, also to you.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.844
General, I wish to inform, I am now fit
for active service.

03:59.930 --> 04:03.560
Don't push your luck, Captain.

04:03.650 --> 04:06.563
After that business with the SS in Poland,

04:06.690 --> 04:08.921
- you were lucky to avoid a court martial.
- Yes, sir.

04:09.010 --> 04:12.208
- This posting is a great honor.
- Yes, General.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.202
Thank you, General.

04:14.290 --> 04:18.769
General, if the Kaiser's in Holland,
how am I supposed to guard him?

04:20.050 --> 04:23.930
At dawn this morning, our forces invaded
Belgium and the Netherlands.

04:26.010 --> 04:28.241
The <i>Führer</i> thinks of everything.

06:06.090 --> 06:08.446
Brandt. Eighth Infantry.

06:08.530 --> 06:12.649
I am Colonel Sigurd von Ilsemann,
aide-de-camp to the Kaiser.

06:12.730 --> 06:16.842
My orders are to assume immediate command
of the Kaiser's personal bodyguards.

06:16.930 --> 06:19.047
A captain?

06:19.130 --> 06:22.043
All the majors are busy, sir.

06:24.730 --> 06:26.722
The Dutch army guard have deserted.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.529
Your men will take their billet
in the stables.

06:28.610 --> 06:30.681
- I'll need a command post.
- I'm in charge of the household.

06:30.770 --> 06:31.840
Within the grounds.

06:31.930 --> 06:36.129
The female staff
are not to be interfered with.

06:36.210 --> 06:38.122
Look forward to working with you, Colonel.

06:38.210 --> 06:39.766
Wilhelm!

06:42.530 --> 06:43.566
Wilhelm!

06:44.350 --> 06:45.881
They're here.

06:45.970 --> 06:50.203
- The army, your army.
- No. No. Not mine.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.168
They have been sent to protect you.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.243
That in itself is not without significance.

06:55.330 --> 06:59.449
In return, it is <i>vital</i> to make
the right impression.

06:59.570 --> 07:01.209
Oh? On whom?

07:02.490 --> 07:06.245
Our friends in Berlin have been constantly
active on your behalf.

07:06.370 --> 07:09.283
The army want you back. They always have.

07:11.610 --> 07:15.399
The stage is set. Every detail matters.

07:16.690 --> 07:18.727
We must invite
the commanding officer to dinner.

07:18.810 --> 07:21.405
So now we're running a restaurant?

07:21.490 --> 07:25.803
- He will be watching us.
- Yes, perhaps. From outside.

07:25.930 --> 07:30.561
Wilhelm, do you want your throne back or not?

07:30.650 --> 07:33.404
You are the Kaiser.

07:36.810 --> 07:39.644
Secure the perimeter.
Get this place cleaned up.

07:39.730 --> 07:42.120
- We have to go faster.
- Move it! Move it! Move it!

07:53.330 --> 07:55.686
I'm looking for Gestapo Inspector Dietrich.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.807
All these boxes get in the building.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.725
Inspector Dietrich, I'm Brandt.

08:06.810 --> 08:09.041
I was expecting you yesterday.

08:09.130 --> 08:12.840
Apologies. My orders were to report
upon arrival. No time was specified.

08:14.850 --> 08:17.319
- What can I do for you, Inspector?
- The Kaiser.

08:17.410 --> 08:20.244
The former Kaiser.

08:20.330 --> 08:24.403
The Gestapo keeps extensive files on this
individual, but they are not up to date.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.602
As part of your duties here,
you will compile a detailed report.

08:27.690 --> 08:31.764
In particular, his attitudes towards
the <i>Reich</i> and its leaders,

08:31.850 --> 08:34.159
anything he says
about the war and its conduct,

08:34.289 --> 08:36.759
noting also significant omissions,

08:36.850 --> 08:40.764
such as failure to agree with statements
made in favor of the <i>Reich</i> and so on.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.490
You expect me to spy on him?

08:43.570 --> 08:46.688
You'll also keep a list of all visitors,
noting the duration of their stay.

08:47.930 --> 08:50.206
- Is that really necessary?
- Ah.

08:50.290 --> 08:54.250
You think because he is old,
he is unimportant?

08:54.330 --> 08:58.006
The British Secret Service
have an agent in the area.

08:58.090 --> 09:01.606
We picked up coded radio
transmissions from the vicinity.

09:01.690 --> 09:04.330
It could be a kidnap attempt
or, most likely, an assassination.

09:04.410 --> 09:08.006
What's the point of killing an old man
that's been out of power for 20 years?

09:08.090 --> 09:10.650
Personally, I couldn't care less.

09:12.690 --> 09:17.606
He is everything that was wrong
with old Germany.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.969
Where was he while we were all starving?

09:22.090 --> 09:25.447
If anything happens to him, Captain,
you'll be shot.

09:25.530 --> 09:27.886
And I will do it.

09:36.930 --> 09:38.762
<i>Did you read the SS file on him?</i>

09:38.850 --> 09:41.763
Hard to believe he wasn't executed.

09:43.370 --> 09:45.282
He must have friends in Berlin.

09:48.530 --> 09:50.487
Brussels fell to our forces yesterday

09:50.570 --> 09:53.369
and airborne troops have secured
the border with France.

09:53.450 --> 09:56.284
Holland is now almost completely occupied,

09:56.370 --> 10:00.159
- barring some unofficial resistance.
- It's unnecessary.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.970
Strategically irrelevant for now
and a waste of resources.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.484
I mean, invading Holland!

10:04.570 --> 10:08.086
Further south, armored divisions
are through the Ardennes forest,

10:08.170 --> 10:10.207
in behind the Maginot Line.

10:15.530 --> 10:18.523
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I was told you have coffee at this time.

10:25.650 --> 10:26.766
You're new.

10:28.610 --> 10:30.681
- Yes, Your Highness.
- No need to be alarmed.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.090
What's your name?

10:34.410 --> 10:36.322
- Mieke, Your Highness.
- Dutch?

10:36.410 --> 10:38.481
- Yes, Your Highness.
- I see.

10:38.570 --> 10:43.087
Well, tell me, child,
would you have invaded Holland?

10:43.210 --> 10:44.200
What?

10:44.290 --> 10:46.361
If you had been in command
of the German army,

10:46.450 --> 10:48.646
would you have invaded Holland?

10:48.730 --> 10:50.801
Why, yes, Your Highness. Of course.

10:50.890 --> 10:55.521
I see. And what precisely
is your military objective?

10:55.610 --> 10:58.682
- Well, it's very nice.
- What is?

10:58.810 --> 11:00.767
Holland.

11:06.970 --> 11:10.850
Goddamn, Sigurd. She's better
than half the General Staff!

11:12.610 --> 11:14.283
We will expect you at tomorrow's briefing!

11:14.410 --> 11:16.970
Yes, Your Highness.

11:19.450 --> 11:22.921
She's the one my wife has been
complaining about, I suppose.

11:23.010 --> 11:26.242
You know, I don't mind telling you,

11:26.330 --> 11:29.607
if I was a hundred years younger...

11:29.690 --> 11:32.125
Oh, never mind.

11:39.170 --> 11:43.084
You know, Sigurd, I've been thinking.

11:45.690 --> 11:47.443
Tonight we'll have fish.

12:44.090 --> 12:47.083
The Kaiser presents his compliments.

12:47.210 --> 12:50.044
He would be pleased if you'd join him
at dinner tomorrow night.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.003
Take your clothes off.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.320
Please.

14:23.610 --> 14:24.726
Gently.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.488
Please...

15:04.050 --> 15:09.000
tell the Kaiser I would be honored
to accept his invitation.

16:05.810 --> 16:06.880
There.

16:11.912 --> 16:13.730
Fuck it.

16:13.810 --> 16:15.210
Your Highness.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.726
May I take that, Captain?

16:25.810 --> 16:27.369
Thank you.

16:35.050 --> 16:37.201
- You stink of schnapps.
- We need to speak.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.850
Not now. You're late. He's waiting.

16:39.930 --> 16:41.967
You'll address him as sir,
and his wife as madame.

16:42.050 --> 16:44.884
The Treaty of Versailles forbids
any other form of address.

16:44.970 --> 16:48.122
His left arm is slightly deformed.
You will not refer to it or look at it.

16:48.210 --> 16:51.767
You will speak only when spoken to
and all discussion of politics is forbidden.

16:51.850 --> 16:55.764
Express no opinion of your own,
agree with his, and remember...

16:55.850 --> 16:59.924
At the age of four, he bit
the Duke of Edinburgh in the leg.

17:07.089 --> 17:12.006
Captain Brandt, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm
Viktor Albrecht von Preussen

17:12.089 --> 17:15.640
and his wife,
Princess Hermine Reuss von Greiz.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.202
Your Highness. Your Highness.

17:23.010 --> 17:25.763
We are both so pleased
that you could join us, Captain.

17:25.849 --> 17:29.605
<i>...that I have always found so fascinating.</i>

17:29.690 --> 17:35.641
<i>I published a book on the subject</i>
<i>in 1934. You will have seen it.</i>

17:35.730 --> 17:39.724
For example, there are some people
who actually believe

17:39.810 --> 17:42.848
that Adolf Hitler invented the swastika.

17:42.930 --> 17:46.367
Utter nonsense.
The word comes from the Sanskrit.

17:46.450 --> 17:48.043
It means "well-being,"

17:48.130 --> 17:52.124
and the earliest examples date
from the Indus Valley,

17:52.210 --> 17:55.169
3,000 years before Christ.

17:55.250 --> 17:58.243
Oh, yes. In many religions, it's...

17:58.330 --> 18:02.085
it is a symbol of life, of good fortune.

18:02.170 --> 18:05.781
Not that it has brought much to me.

18:10.010 --> 18:14.687
And yet we must accept that God
has imposed these terrible trials on us

18:14.770 --> 18:18.480
for some inscrutable purpose of His own.

18:19.650 --> 18:24.850
Oh, these books they're writing, my God!

18:24.930 --> 18:28.367
They just dump bucketloads of filth
on my head

18:28.450 --> 18:31.170
and nobody does anything.

18:32.210 --> 18:35.806
Bismarck would have had
something to say on the subject.

18:35.890 --> 18:40.720
But then he had something to say on every
subject, which is why I got rid of him.

18:40.810 --> 18:47.569
His servants would pull
the wine corks in front of you.

18:47.650 --> 18:51.610
But I must say the old boy knew
how to deal with troublemakers.

18:51.690 --> 18:55.047
Freemasons, Bolsheviks, Jews.

18:55.130 --> 18:58.123
The unholy alliance that we have to face.

18:58.210 --> 19:03.524
Which is exactly why a strong monarchy,

19:03.610 --> 19:07.399
the physical manifestation
of God's will on earth,

19:07.490 --> 19:11.279
is more vital now than ever.

19:13.970 --> 19:17.361
Tell us a little about yourself, Captain.
Where's your family from?

19:17.450 --> 19:19.567
Brandenburg, Your Highness.

19:21.090 --> 19:24.561
My grandfather was an army officer,

19:24.690 --> 19:26.409
as was my father.

19:26.490 --> 19:30.006
He was killed on the Somme
just before I was born.

19:31.730 --> 19:34.609
- And your mother?
- From a landowning family.

19:34.690 --> 19:38.047
- Really? Which one?
- Related to the Ludendorffs.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.725
- Oh.
- Distantly.

19:40.810 --> 19:45.202
After the war, of course,
she had to clean houses.

19:45.290 --> 19:49.603
I remember helping her
wheel her wages home in a barrow.

19:51.130 --> 19:53.770
Of course, by the time we got
to the bakery, it was worthless.

19:53.850 --> 19:56.968
- She died of tuberculosis when I was 12.
- Mm-hmm.

20:00.690 --> 20:06.243
Am I to blame for every misfortune
on this earth?

20:08.090 --> 20:10.241
I gave my life to the Fatherland!

20:10.330 --> 20:13.767
And this is my thanks?

20:13.850 --> 20:16.968
Nobody cares my navy betrayed me!

20:17.050 --> 20:19.724
Nobody remembers my army fell apart.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.847
Ludendorff, Bethmann, Tirpitz!

20:21.930 --> 20:24.525
Where were they? Where were they?
Where were they?

20:25.890 --> 20:27.768
After all I've done for them,

20:27.850 --> 20:30.763
they stabbed me in the back.

20:34.010 --> 20:35.285
They lost me the war!

20:43.290 --> 20:44.963
They lost me my country.

21:13.690 --> 21:19.129
I ask forgiveness for unintentionally
upsetting His Highness.

21:19.210 --> 21:21.247
His earlier remark about the <i>Führer</i>

21:21.330 --> 21:23.447
was simply a correction of fact,
you understand?

21:23.530 --> 21:24.884
In no way a criticism.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.522
The trout was first rate.

21:37.890 --> 21:39.290
Hmm.

22:19.570 --> 22:20.799
How did you get in?

22:27.210 --> 22:28.485
Take your clothes off.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.601
Will there be anything else, Your Highness?

24:15.730 --> 24:20.930
No, thank you, Sigurd.
There will be absolutely nothing.

24:45.530 --> 24:46.520
Wait.

24:49.890 --> 24:53.201
Stay. Stay the night.

25:33.410 --> 25:35.003
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Huh!

25:36.250 --> 25:39.561
I had a visit just now from Captain Brandt.

25:39.690 --> 25:42.967
He tells me the British
have an agent active in this area.

25:43.050 --> 25:46.202
It is his opinion that this agent
may wish you harm.

25:46.290 --> 25:48.600
An agent?

25:48.690 --> 25:50.807
We must alert the ducks.

25:50.890 --> 25:55.043
He therefore requests that he move
into the house immediately.

25:59.770 --> 26:03.400
What do you think of him, our Captain Brandt?

26:04.970 --> 26:08.441
He is a typical, cocky young officer,

26:08.530 --> 26:10.203
who thinks he can win the war on his own.

26:11.810 --> 26:14.405
Does he remind you of anyone, Sigurd?

26:16.810 --> 26:17.926
Not at all.

26:19.290 --> 26:21.930
Are you ready for your daily briefing,
Your Highness?

26:22.010 --> 26:26.368
I think I will give it a miss.

26:28.890 --> 26:35.364
I have something much more important to do.

26:48.450 --> 26:51.124
He is not himself.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.282
But I expect great news any day now.

26:54.370 --> 26:56.601
We must never lose hope.

26:56.690 --> 26:59.842
It is the hope which is killing him.

26:59.930 --> 27:02.764
Of course, I shall say nothing for now.

27:02.850 --> 27:05.809
Until then, we must just keep his spirits up.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.804
Ahem.

27:19.890 --> 27:22.246
- Oh.
- Forgive me, Your Highness.

27:22.330 --> 27:25.960
Colonel von Ilsemann sent me out
with more bread.

27:26.050 --> 27:28.610
Oh, did he now?
That was very good of him. Ha!

27:28.690 --> 27:31.080
- For the ducks.
- Oh, for the ducks, of course.

27:31.170 --> 27:32.604
It's a bit early for my lunch.

27:34.690 --> 27:37.159
No, why don't <i>you</i> feed them?

27:44.290 --> 27:46.521
You have beautiful hands.

27:46.650 --> 27:52.282
You are quite unused to physical labor, no?

27:52.370 --> 27:55.727
War changes everything.

27:55.810 --> 27:56.880
<i>Ja.</i>

27:58.730 --> 28:03.805
What do you think of ducks, child?
Hmm? I'm very fond of them.

28:03.890 --> 28:07.201
They're beautiful creatures,
and they ask for so little.

28:07.290 --> 28:10.089
A duck will never blame you for his troubles

28:10.170 --> 28:13.607
or force you to abdicate your throne.

28:15.610 --> 28:21.004
I know you miss it terribly,
and yet, what a dreadful burden.

28:21.090 --> 28:25.369
You're right. And it was.

28:25.450 --> 28:27.203
Captain. Captain!

28:29.090 --> 28:30.206
Your Highness.

28:31.330 --> 28:35.768
I hear there's a British spy after me.

28:35.850 --> 28:37.045
You'll be quite safe, Your Highness.

28:37.130 --> 28:38.883
Oh...

28:38.970 --> 28:43.647
Sigurd tells me that you fought
in Poland last year.

28:43.730 --> 28:48.168
My grandson, Oscar, was killed
at the front there.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.128
Perhaps you knew?

28:50.210 --> 28:54.090
No. No, Your Highness. I... I didn't.
Please accept my sympathies.

28:55.090 --> 28:59.767
Last September. Hmm.
You must come to dinner again.

28:59.890 --> 29:02.644
Tell me all about it. Er...

29:04.210 --> 29:09.808
Why don't you, er, show the captain
his new rooms at the house?

29:10.850 --> 29:11.966
Of course, Your Highness.

29:36.810 --> 29:39.803
My name is Stefan.
I was wondering what yours was.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.681
De Jong. Mieke de Jong.

29:45.810 --> 29:47.961
May I call you Mieke?

29:48.050 --> 29:49.530
It would be better if you didn't.

29:51.930 --> 29:55.241
Copulation is strictly forbidden
among the staff.

29:55.330 --> 29:59.165
I would lose my position.
You might lose yours.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.764
Where's your room?

30:02.650 --> 30:05.961
On the other side of the staircase.
The last on the right.

30:14.690 --> 30:16.204
They told me you were up here.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.084
Nice place. Very comfy.

30:20.170 --> 30:22.002
What can I do for you, Inspector?

30:22.090 --> 30:24.366
There was another transmission last night.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.487
At the moment, we only have
the one detector truck,

30:26.570 --> 30:29.529
but there's a chance
it's coming from the village.

30:29.610 --> 30:33.809
We're getting a second truck soon,
and then we will find the exact location.

30:33.890 --> 30:37.850
- Soon?
- How's your report coming?

30:39.850 --> 30:43.241
Fuck. I wouldn't mind
pulling her in for questioning.

30:43.370 --> 30:48.809
You know, they say the Dutch women
are as sex-mad as the French.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.359
I'm sure your <i>Reich</i> Marks
will be welcome anywhere.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.964
- What?
- In the meantime,

30:53.050 --> 30:56.088
perhaps you should spend less time
lusting after servant girls

30:56.170 --> 30:59.083
and more finding a second detector truck.

30:59.170 --> 31:03.687
Ah! You've marked her out
for yourself, have you?

31:03.770 --> 31:07.127
Copulation is strictly forbidden
among the staff.

31:07.210 --> 31:08.929
Goodbye, Inspector.

31:43.530 --> 31:46.329
Anyone might think
you were spying on me, Captain.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.766
Forgive me, Your Highness.

31:52.010 --> 31:54.764
What are you doing
creeping around in the woods?

31:54.850 --> 31:57.319
If anything happens to you,
Your Highness, I'll be shot.

31:57.410 --> 32:00.369
Oh, it's good to know they still care.

32:01.810 --> 32:03.324
Walk with me.

32:06.130 --> 32:09.965
Tell me about Poland. Your first action?

32:10.050 --> 32:11.643
Yes, Your Highness.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.881
What you expected?

32:13.970 --> 32:15.962
I expected to die.

32:16.210 --> 32:17.803
Come on!

32:30.610 --> 32:33.079
- They know there's a British agent here.
- Who knows?

32:33.170 --> 32:34.889
The army captain guarding the Kaiser.

32:34.970 --> 32:37.280
And the Gestapo turned up at the house today.

32:37.370 --> 32:41.205
If they knew any more than that,
you'd have been arrested by now

32:49.730 --> 32:51.642
- When can you do it?
- I need more time.

32:51.730 --> 32:54.040
- You may not have it.
- I know that.

32:58.330 --> 33:01.323
As soon as you feel it's safe, do it.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.166
Then we'll get you out.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.000
Be careful.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.918
What are you doing?

34:21.010 --> 34:23.764
I wanted to see you.

34:23.850 --> 34:26.445
I'm on duty now. They're calling me.

34:28.810 --> 34:34.248
There's a Gestapo officer,
Dietrich, in Utrecht.

34:34.330 --> 34:36.525
What about him?

34:36.610 --> 34:38.841
If he bothers you at all, tell me.

34:39.850 --> 34:41.250
I'll deal with it.

34:51.770 --> 34:55.810
It seems the General Staff has learnt
from its mistakes of last time.

34:55.889 --> 34:58.359
Wouldn't you say, huh, child?

34:58.450 --> 34:59.645
On the whole, Your Highness.

35:01.050 --> 35:05.169
Although, they may find
the infernal machinery,

35:05.250 --> 35:09.449
<i>la machine infernale,</i>
harder to stop than to start.

35:09.530 --> 35:13.922
I never wanted the last war, you know.

35:14.010 --> 35:19.244
But there are still people who don't...
who don't seem to realize that.

35:19.330 --> 35:22.767
Of course, the Serbs were a crowd of thugs.

35:22.850 --> 35:24.728
They still are.

35:24.810 --> 35:28.599
But I told the Austrians,

35:28.690 --> 35:32.366
"You got what you wanted. Stop in Belgrade!"

35:32.490 --> 35:37.121
I wrote a telegram to Vienna,
"Stop in Belgrade!"

35:38.170 --> 35:40.127
They never sent it.

35:40.250 --> 35:45.279
Bethmann, Moltke,
they wanted the war, you see.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.802
It was never sent. They made sure of that.

35:48.890 --> 35:50.609
Yes, Your Highness.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.080
My voice... my voice was a lone voice.

35:53.170 --> 35:55.810
- Perhaps... perhaps, Your Highness...
- What could I do? What could I do?

35:55.930 --> 36:00.686
...the Captain would like to see
your collection of military uniforms.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.608
Yes, yes, go on.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.684
He was still the Kaiser.

36:24.770 --> 36:27.524
He could have sent another fucking telegram.

36:30.410 --> 36:32.322
Any progress catching the spy?

36:32.410 --> 36:34.845
They're waiting for another signal truck.

37:08.650 --> 37:10.528
Your family.

37:13.370 --> 37:16.522
- My family, Your Highness?
- Are they all right?

37:16.610 --> 37:21.480
If there's anything I can do for them,
you must let me know.

37:21.570 --> 37:25.166
- These are difficult times.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

37:25.250 --> 37:27.321
Your Highness...

37:27.410 --> 37:28.560
What is it?

37:29.570 --> 37:31.402
You're very kind, Your Highness. Good night.

37:36.730 --> 37:39.199
- Was that girl asking for money?
- No, I...

37:39.290 --> 37:42.966
I believe I was inquiring about her family.

37:43.050 --> 37:44.689
Perhaps I dreamed it.

37:44.770 --> 37:46.762
Well, I don't like her manner.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.560
If it weren't for the shortage,
I would certainly let her go.

38:00.730 --> 38:04.280
I suppose it's part of your duties
to read this stuff?

38:04.370 --> 38:06.885
- You're ignorant.
- I know.

38:15.850 --> 38:21.528
Mieke, I wanted to apologize for how I was
the first time we met.

38:22.570 --> 38:23.765
Met?

38:25.210 --> 38:26.326
You know what I mean.

38:42.650 --> 38:45.210
I wanted you.

39:16.010 --> 39:18.730
It's somewhere in the village.

39:18.810 --> 39:20.085
We'll get him next time.

39:26.930 --> 39:30.446
So, how did you get
your Iron Cross Second Class?

39:34.290 --> 39:37.283
I survived in a second class way.

39:38.730 --> 39:40.210
And the scars?

39:41.730 --> 39:43.369
Shrapnel.

39:45.810 --> 39:47.961
Most of it's still in there.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.450
It hurts you.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.682
Is that why you're stuck here
and not at the front?

39:57.290 --> 40:00.044
I'm here because I follow orders.

40:00.130 --> 40:03.487
Do you always follow orders?

40:03.570 --> 40:04.799
What else is there?

40:10.410 --> 40:12.163
I'm Jewish.

40:27.290 --> 40:28.485
I'm not.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.199
Obviously.

40:52.970 --> 40:55.326
I don't care.

40:55.410 --> 40:56.890
One day, you might have to.

40:58.530 --> 41:01.364
One day, we'll be dead.

41:37.690 --> 41:39.647
You have bad dreams.

41:45.930 --> 41:49.606
You have someone, somewhere?

41:50.930 --> 41:54.401
If I did, you wouldn't be here.

41:57.090 --> 42:00.561
And you, Captain? No girl anywhere?

42:02.290 --> 42:06.170
If I did, I'd still be here.

42:11.010 --> 42:12.763
You have to go.

42:22.410 --> 42:24.879
What you told me about yourself...

42:28.250 --> 42:29.525
don't tell anyone else.

43:22.930 --> 43:24.762
You're up early, Inspector.

43:24.850 --> 43:27.570
The transmitter's right in the village.

43:27.650 --> 43:30.006
If he doesn't signal tonight,
we'll go in and search.

43:31.210 --> 43:32.610
Hmm.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.402
But that's not why I'm here.

43:39.890 --> 43:44.362
The old man is getting a visit
tomorrow, from the head of the SS.

43:45.530 --> 43:48.921
- Himmler's coming here?
- You catch on quick.

43:49.010 --> 43:53.323
He'll have dinner, then we'll take him
back to a secret location.

43:53.450 --> 43:55.487
- I'll notify the household.
- No, you won't.

43:55.570 --> 43:57.766
You can tell the old man, but no one else.

43:57.850 --> 44:00.490
I'm handling his security,
so we'll be searching the house today.

44:00.570 --> 44:02.482
I'll need a list of all the staff.

44:02.570 --> 44:04.641
And what do I tell them?
They're bound to ask questions.

44:04.730 --> 44:08.724
Oh, their job is to answer them.
I'll be back in an hour.

44:21.370 --> 44:24.044
Captain Brandt requests a private audience.

44:24.130 --> 44:25.723
Hmm.

44:32.810 --> 44:36.562
Your Highness, what I have to tell you is top
secret and must remain strictly between us.

44:36.650 --> 44:38.209
Wilhelm! Oh, Captain.

44:38.290 --> 44:40.407
Have you heard the news?

44:40.490 --> 44:42.641
<i>Reichsführer</i> of the SS, Heinrich Himmler,

44:42.730 --> 44:45.723
is coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Isn't that marvelous?

44:45.810 --> 44:47.608
I just received a telegram from Berlin.

44:47.690 --> 44:51.320
One can only hope that he has
better manners than that oaf, Goering.

44:53.010 --> 44:56.924
It is a pity that his wife is not able
to join him, but still...

44:57.010 --> 44:59.127
Oh, we have a million things to do!

44:59.210 --> 45:02.487
He came here a few years back, fat Goering.

45:02.570 --> 45:05.529
You never knew if he was a boy or a girl.

45:05.610 --> 45:08.569
And he came down to lunch in plus fours.

45:08.690 --> 45:10.966
Plus fours!

45:11.050 --> 45:13.645
My old regiment would have set
the dogs on him.

45:15.930 --> 45:18.240
My husband is always joking.

45:19.650 --> 45:21.687
You must have a great deal
to do today, Captain,

45:21.770 --> 45:24.410
so we mustn't keep you a moment longer.

45:30.330 --> 45:31.923
Better start counting the silver.

45:32.010 --> 45:33.160
Wilhelm!

45:33.250 --> 45:37.003
I regret to inform you the Gestapo will
be making a thorough search of the house

45:37.090 --> 45:38.763
before the <i>Reichsführer's</i> visit.

45:38.850 --> 45:44.084
And may I say, between us,
it would be better if the Kaiser

45:44.170 --> 45:48.801
didn't air certain opinions
in front of the Gestapo.

45:48.890 --> 45:51.962
Inspector Dietrich has no sense of humor.

45:56.090 --> 45:57.570
Oh, Colonel?

46:00.490 --> 46:02.800
Do you keep guns in the house?

46:02.890 --> 46:05.121
Of course. His Highness shoots.

46:05.210 --> 46:08.521
- And who cleans them?
- The guns? The footmen.

46:08.610 --> 46:10.761
Hmm. Not the maids?

46:10.850 --> 46:13.206
No, of course not the maids. Why?

46:13.290 --> 46:14.690
Thank you.

46:17.610 --> 46:20.000
At ease. Ready?

46:24.130 --> 46:27.726
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

46:27.810 --> 46:30.279
You must pay no attention
to my husband's jokes.

46:30.370 --> 46:33.329
You know, there is nobody
more loyal to the <i>Führer.</i>

46:33.410 --> 46:35.083
Please.

46:36.450 --> 46:40.364
Now, this visit tomorrow
is of the utmost significance.

46:40.490 --> 46:43.289
It is, of course, well-known,
among those who know,

46:43.410 --> 46:45.402
that Himmler is Hitler's right-hand man.

46:45.490 --> 46:48.085
One hears that Goering
isn't quite so trusted.

46:48.170 --> 46:50.526
Although it is due to my efforts
in that direction,

46:50.610 --> 46:55.169
I shall say no more, that the government
continues to pay our allowance,

46:55.250 --> 46:58.163
which Wilhelm doesn't seem to understand,

46:58.250 --> 47:00.481
could be taken away at any moment.

47:00.570 --> 47:03.642
But, before the last war, of course,
he was the richest man in Germany,

47:03.730 --> 47:07.041
so I'm afraid he has
very little idea of money.

47:08.970 --> 47:11.804
The purpose of this visit

47:11.890 --> 47:17.648
can only be to propose in some form
the restoration of the monarchy.

47:19.530 --> 47:22.648
Oh, the <i>Führer</i> has done
very well so far, of course.

47:22.730 --> 47:25.370
But it is obvious that,
in this time of crisis,

47:25.450 --> 47:28.204
Germany needs its king.

47:28.330 --> 47:30.526
A man of wisdom and experience,

47:30.610 --> 47:32.681
who can ensure the allegiance of the Church,

47:32.770 --> 47:36.559
- the aristocracy, and the armed forces.
- Hmm.

47:36.650 --> 47:40.246
I myself have been using what little
influence I have in Berlin.

47:40.330 --> 47:42.287
Oh, I shall say no more.

47:42.370 --> 47:46.603
But I am delighted
that my efforts have borne fruit.

47:46.690 --> 47:50.570
It was for Germany that I acted, of course.

47:50.650 --> 47:52.607
Certainly not for the pleasure
of seeing my sisters

47:52.730 --> 47:55.245
- bowing and scraping in front of me.
- Hmm.

47:55.330 --> 47:58.482
Do you know, I am not sure I shall even
receive them in court.

47:58.610 --> 48:01.205
They treated me very shabbily
when I was young.

48:04.090 --> 48:09.563
Captain, as head of the Kaiser's
personal bodyguard,

48:09.650 --> 48:12.119
<i>Herr</i> Himmler will surely want
your impressions.

48:13.490 --> 48:18.568
May I hope you will give a positive account
of our humble and loyal household?

48:18.650 --> 48:20.607
- Of course, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Captain

48:20.690 --> 48:23.250
- I was certain I could rely on you.
- If you'll excuse me.

48:30.330 --> 48:32.003
- Yes.
- <i>Everyone knows.</i>

48:32.090 --> 48:34.969
- Hmm?
- Kaiser's wife got a telegram.

48:35.050 --> 48:37.007
I'll find out who sent it.

48:37.090 --> 48:39.286
May I suggest my men start
at the top, work down?

48:39.370 --> 48:40.850
You come up from the bottom.

48:40.930 --> 48:44.048
Yes, that's just what I was going to suggest.

48:46.810 --> 48:47.800
<i>It's a madhouse.</i>

48:47.890 --> 48:50.450
It's a damned madhouse!

48:50.530 --> 48:52.965
Who do they think they are?
Who do they think I am?

48:54.570 --> 48:55.970
You should never have permitted it!

48:57.210 --> 48:58.803
Send me the damned girl!

49:07.610 --> 49:09.010
Take a room each.

49:12.610 --> 49:16.763
Be respectful of personal property,
but thorough.

49:16.850 --> 49:19.285
I'll start at the far end.

49:36.450 --> 49:41.570
You know, my Uncle Friedrich once told me

49:41.650 --> 49:46.281
that a one-armed man
should never be King in Prussia.

49:46.370 --> 49:51.320
"I'll show you," I thought,
"you miserable swine."

49:54.170 --> 49:58.210
The old bastard died
just before I came to the throne.

50:00.570 --> 50:03.039
I always thought he did it on purpose.

50:07.650 --> 50:09.289
By the way, are you courting?

50:09.410 --> 50:10.969
Courting?

50:12.370 --> 50:15.966
No. Well, not exactly, Your Highness.
I mean, there is someone.

50:16.050 --> 50:18.541
Oh, of course there is.

50:19.530 --> 50:21.362
Do you love him?

50:21.450 --> 50:23.487
No, I... I hardly know him.

50:27.210 --> 50:30.647
You know, my... the first girl
I ever loved, her name was Ella.

50:30.730 --> 50:33.848
We had the same grandmother,
Queen Victoria of England,

50:33.930 --> 50:35.887
on her mother's side and on mine.

50:35.970 --> 50:38.246
But Ella...

50:38.330 --> 50:43.689
Oh, she was gorgeous.

50:46.170 --> 50:47.923
Of course, she knew it.

50:48.010 --> 50:51.481
I went down on my knees one summer evening

50:51.570 --> 50:53.960
and begged her to be my wife.

50:54.050 --> 50:57.566
Instead, she married a Romanov.

50:57.650 --> 51:00.484
Butchered by Bolsheviks in a mine shaft.

51:00.570 --> 51:04.610
"That'll teach her," I thought.

51:07.570 --> 51:09.050
So...

51:10.690 --> 51:12.886
the moral of this story is...

51:14.570 --> 51:16.527
Be careful what you wish for.

51:18.090 --> 51:21.686
And, as they say, seize the day.

51:24.810 --> 51:27.405
Yes, definitely do that.

51:38.570 --> 51:41.483
- Finished?
- For now.

51:41.570 --> 51:44.802
- You look happy.
- Of course.

51:44.890 --> 51:48.804
Here am I, a butcher's son from Munich,

51:48.890 --> 51:52.167
tearing the Kaiser's palace upside down.

51:54.130 --> 51:56.929
That is what National Socialism
has done for Germany.

52:08.930 --> 52:11.365
Staff files from von Ilsemann.

52:15.010 --> 52:17.730
- What do you think of him?
- He's harmless.

52:17.810 --> 52:20.325
- I don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.

52:20.410 --> 52:21.639
Hmm.

52:23.490 --> 52:25.368
We'll be back...

52:25.450 --> 52:27.009
tomorrow.

52:53.490 --> 52:55.607
Get it refueled.

53:10.770 --> 53:13.569
Himmler's coming to the house tomorrow.

53:13.650 --> 53:16.210
Himmler? The head of the SS?

53:16.290 --> 53:19.840
He'll arrive in the afternoon,
and he'll stay for dinner.

53:19.930 --> 53:22.968
- I can kill him.
- No, that's not our mission.

53:23.050 --> 53:26.248
Well, tell London. They might change it.

53:26.330 --> 53:27.923
No, it would be suicide!

53:31.450 --> 53:34.568
The SS murdered my father and my husband.

53:34.650 --> 53:36.846
- You're not here to avenge your family.
- Tell London.

53:36.930 --> 53:39.923
Tell them I'm ready. Tell them I'll do it.

53:41.890 --> 53:44.450
Oh, my God.

53:44.530 --> 53:46.965
Oh, Mieke.

53:51.650 --> 53:53.767
I'll come to the house.

53:53.850 --> 53:57.730
And I'll give you the answer tomorrow.

54:21.690 --> 54:23.044
Let's go!

55:59.290 --> 56:00.406
Sorry.

56:01.610 --> 56:03.647
I can go, if you want.

56:07.290 --> 56:08.326
No.

56:18.610 --> 56:19.930
Stay.

56:51.930 --> 56:53.444
What is it this time?

56:55.930 --> 56:57.284
<i>Poland.</i>

57:00.770 --> 57:03.410
<i>A village of women and children.</i>

57:06.530 --> 57:08.886
<i>They'd been machine-gunned by the SS.</i>

57:13.810 --> 57:16.279
<i>It was a beautiful day.</i>

57:19.890 --> 57:22.564
And I thought...

57:22.650 --> 57:25.370
"God made this.

57:25.450 --> 57:28.124
God made all of it."

57:46.130 --> 57:48.201
<i>There was a girl.</i>

57:48.290 --> 57:50.282
<i>She was still alive.</i>

57:51.490 --> 57:53.925
<i>I tried to help her, but she died.</i>

57:58.690 --> 58:02.969
I beat the officer senseless
in front of his unit.

58:03.090 --> 58:08.085
It's men like that, they shame the SS.
They shame us all.

58:08.170 --> 58:12.642
But they are not the exception,
they are the rule.

58:12.730 --> 58:15.006
I don't believe that.

58:17.650 --> 58:19.482
I have to go.

58:27.610 --> 58:31.126
- Will you marry me?
- What?

58:31.210 --> 58:33.566
Marry me, Mieke. Now. Today.

58:35.850 --> 58:37.842
- Are you serious?
- Completely.

58:37.930 --> 58:39.489
But I'm a Jewess.

58:39.570 --> 58:42.369
- I'll protect you.
- No!

58:42.450 --> 58:44.248
Nobody can.

58:46.610 --> 58:47.930
I will do my duty.

58:48.050 --> 58:49.404
Everyone must.

59:08.410 --> 59:10.766
You never stop. You're always there.

59:11.770 --> 59:13.204
Ah.

59:22.610 --> 59:27.685
Why is he coming, Sigurd? Why?

59:29.650 --> 59:32.210
Not to see my uniforms.

59:37.370 --> 59:39.168
Is it possible?

59:41.010 --> 59:43.366
After all this time?

59:48.170 --> 59:52.323
I dare not hope. I cannot.

59:52.450 --> 59:55.727
Certainly it would make
the Empress exceedingly happy.

59:55.810 --> 59:57.005
A small price to pay.

59:59.170 --> 01:00:03.084
Sigurd, I have to be
at this morning's briefings.

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:05.441
I must be up to date for our visitors.

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:08.887
- Your Highness.
- What?

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:13.965
Wilhelm, I am sorry to involve you
in this sordid affair.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.327
This disgrace also involves the head
of your personal bodyguard,

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.969
whom you'll wish to dismiss yourself.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.485
What precisely is the nature of this scandal?

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:26.008
This girl has been caught in flagrante
in this officer's bedroom.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.049
And <i>Frau</i> Linnenkamp swears
it is not the first time.

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:31.406
Your Highness, I am entirely to blame.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.967
That this should come to light on the very
day that <i>Herr</i> Himmler is to visit!

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.007
God forbid that he should hear of it!

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.561
You are dismissed.
Go and pack your effects immediately.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.165
Now, just a moment.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:47.483
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:52.087
I will speak to the captain and the girl.

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.481
In private.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.050
I'm not sure you understand.

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.884
They have been caught fornicating
under our roof.

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:03.326
This girl is no better than a common slut.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.925
This officer has disgraced his uniform.

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.239
<i>Your</i> uniform.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:12.644
I may not rule in Germany,
but, by Christ, I rule in my own house!

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:51.121
This is him, I hope?

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.965
- Of course, Your Highness.
- Well!

01:01:55.050 --> 01:02:00.364
I am ashamed to say that before and after
my first marriage,

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:04.603
I myself fathered
at least two illegitimate children.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:09.242
One with an Austrian Countess,
another with a French prostitute,

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:13.563
who was known in court circles
as "Madame l'Amour."

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.768
Both, incidentally, blackmailed me
for huge sums of money,

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:19.046
the Countess and the prostitute.

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.168
I expected better of the prostitute.

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:27.130
Now, I have many vices.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:31.690
Hypocrisy is not one of them.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:38.090
So you will resume your duties,
but this time...

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.682
you will be more discreet.

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.690
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.162
His Highness will see you now.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:18.360
Telephone message for you, Captain.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:29.690
- You sent for me?
- I've got something to show you.

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:34.483
It was the fucking pastor!

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:36.482
We found the radio set and everything.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.688
Dirksen knocked him clean out last night,
or we would have started sooner.

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:42.444
Still, we should have
everything we need by tonight.

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:56.929
Good work, Inspector.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.162
I'm sorry I could not count
on your support this morning, Sigurd.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.448
And furthermore, your attitude
since the news of <i>Herr</i> Himmler's visit

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.409
is far from what I might have hoped.

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:41.642
I long for the restoration of the monarchy
as much as you do.

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:47.008
And yet I fear this meeting carries
with it a very grave risk.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:51.287
- What are you talking about, Sigurd?
- The Kaiser's temper is short.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:54.966
Should Himmler provoke him to rage,
as Goering so very nearly did,

01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:56.803
His Highness could lose everything.

01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:02.409
Not only the annual allowance they so
generously grant him, but his life.

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.767
The Night of the Long Knives taught us
who and what they are.

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.490
The <i>Führer</i> simply dealt
with a few Jews and Communists.

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:13.884
The former Chancellor and his wife,
gunned down in their own home.

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:16.883
Nobody is safe, not even you.

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:23.569
Then you must make sure he is not provoked,

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.680
mustn't you, Colonel?

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.969
Your Highness.

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:16.129
Captain?

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:24.641
He's here. He's here!

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.005
Mm-hmm.

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:48.846
Attention!

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:23.369
<i>Herr Reichsführer,</i> I am Sigurd von Ilsemann.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.761
- Welcome to Huis Doorn.
- <i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:31.441
May I present Captain Brandt
of the Eighth Infantry Regiment?

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.965
- He commands the army here.
- Captain.

01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:55.043
May I present
Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor...

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:56.200
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:04.444
<i>Herr Reichsführer,</i>
welcome to our humble home.

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:08.240
We are delighted you could spare
the time from your innumerable duties

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:10.526
and we are only sorry your dear wife

01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:14.286
is unable to come with you on this occasion.

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:16.879
You will, we hope, allow us,

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:20.486
as representatives
of the Hohenzollern dynasty

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:24.246
and the royal house of Prussia,
to congratulate you and the <i>Führer</i>

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:28.085
on the latest of your astounding series
of great victories.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.322
The National Socialist
Democratic Workers' Party

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:34.926
thanks you for your kind words
and your loyal support.

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.929
May I show you to your rooms?

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:45.526
Thank you. It's been a tiring journey.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:58.000
May I request, before dinner,
the pleasure of a private audience?

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:01.322
That is to say,
a meeting on matters of State.

01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:03.049
I shall arrange it.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:18.689
- I need to see you.
- Not now.

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.807
Yes, now!

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.327
No, we were told to be discreet.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.130
The pastor's been arrested by the Gestapo.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:29.008
They're interrogating him now.

01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:31.559
Soon he'll tell them everything he knows.

01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:38.721
- Why do you tell me this?
- Why did you sleep with me?

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:40.368
- Why did you ask me?
- Were you following orders?

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:42.567
No, it was a mistake, a madness.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:46.006
- You used me!
- I used myself.

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:48.446
If you wanted to kill him,
you could have done that any time.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:53.247
- I'll scream the house down!
- Oh, you will when Dietrich starts.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:10:00.480
- How did you know?
- I saw you with him at the church.

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:04.360
And you're a Jew who knows German army medals

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.522
and keeps gun oil hidden in her room.

01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:11.889
Then, Captain, you must do your duty.

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:18.566
Just leave. Leave now.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:23.760
- Please.
- I can't.

01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:27.924
Do you expect me to betray my oath,
my country, for you?

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:32.801
I expected nothing from you, Captain.

01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:37.009
You must do your duty. And I will do mine.

01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:32.441
Forgive me, <i>Herr Reichsführer.</i>

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.803
What can I do for you?

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:47.529
This is for you, <i>Herr Reichsführer.</i>

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:49.442
I'm sure a man in your position

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:54.207
must have so many unforeseen expenses
in your positions...

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:56.646
It can be so difficult to make ends meet.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.928
Certainly, I know in my own household...

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.804
servants, oh, they are so expensive,
especially in wartime.

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:05.365
So difficult to keep.

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:18.362
Thank you.

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:21.290
Here you are!

01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.930
I was worried. It's almost time for dinner.

01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:27.640
Wilhelm?

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:39.246
It seems we are to go back to Berlin.

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.210
If we choose.

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:47.202
Can that be true?

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.721
You are to be king again?

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:02.399
I'm afraid I'm going to need a new wardrobe.

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.329
For now, I think we should keep this
to ourselves.

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.560
Mm.

01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:21.207
<i>Oh, my dear</i> Frau <i>Linnenkamp.</i>

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:26.288
First thing tomorrow, I shall say no more,
we must start packing the house.

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:31.400
<i>Your Highness.</i>

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:37.399
May I be the first
to offer my congratulations?

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:43.485
I know we both had reservations
about these people

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.007
and all the people in power, but...

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.649
Yet I believe that both they
and the German people

01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:57.647
can only benefit from a firm
and Christian presence on the throne.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:59.489
A restraining influence.

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.087
Perhaps God has not forgotten me after all.

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:16.450
Make yourself at home.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.965
- Some of us weren't invited to dinner.
- Ah.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.403
So much for National Socialism.

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:29.206
Has the pastor talked yet?

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:31.646
I just called them. It won't be long.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:35.730
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.164
At ease, gentlemen.

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:46.919
Is that schnapps, by any chance?

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:56.720
This will go no further.

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:02.923
I have just told the former Kaiser
that the <i>Führer</i> has,

01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:07.687
under strict conditions,
and for the good of the Fatherland,

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:11.650
agreed to bring him back from exile
to take up his throne once more in Berlin.

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:22.045
I have to tell you now
that this is a deception.

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:27.886
Its aim is to flush out any remaining
monarchist sympathizers, in the <i>Reich.</i>

01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:31.324
You two will work together

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:35.768
to intercept any communications
in and out of the house.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:36.966
When messengers are sent,

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:39.884
you'll find out where where they
come from or where they're going,

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.769
and report directly to my office in Berlin.

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:45.689
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:50.844
Any questions?

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:53.759
Good.

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:16.001
Captain. Thank you.

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.561
He's holding out. For now.

01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:35.443
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.768
I'm starving.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:43.405
We'll take a break
until he comes round again.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.640
<i>The Americans will stay out this time.</i>

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:52.439
They are decadent people, no fonder of
the Jews and Communists than we are.

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:54.960
Now, there I disagree with you.

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:59.841
We face an international conspiracy
funded by Jewish capital

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:02.001
which has its home in America.

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:05.565
It will have to be defeated sooner or later.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:07.209
I'm glad to hear you say that.

01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:09.930
You had 30 years to do something
about the Jews.

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:14.281
And yet, you just let them get on with it.

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:16.770
We had other priorities.

01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:20.207
But you had Jewish friends, didn't you?
I'm sure I read that.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:24.561
In the last war, the German Jews fought
and died for our country

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.801
- in their hundreds of thousands.
- What's your point?

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:27.960
I think it's fair to say

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:31.248
that few people really understood
the Jewish threat until the '20s.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.686
And for that we are very grateful
to the <i>Führer.</i>

01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.762
Of course, the problem
is the same everywhere,

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:39.161
but only now, in Germany, is there
sufficient clarity of thought

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:42.846
to admit the scale of the task
and to examine the potential solutions

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:46.287
in a thorough and an imaginative manner.

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:50.410
And yet, where we lead
I'm sure that others will follow.

01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:53.722
It's obvious Germany needs more room
for its people, especially in the east,

01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:57.440
and for that there will have to be a
certain re-ordering of other populations.

01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:01.604
And where relocation is impractical,
a more sensible solution must be found.

01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:03.727
The elderly, the crippled, the mentally ill

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:05.887
are simply a drain on the <i>Reich's</i> resources.

01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:09.725
- Not to mention the children, of course.
- Well, indeed.

01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:11.802
In wartime, it is hardly feasible
to feed them

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:15.679
until they can provide the return on capital.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:18.888
And we are very much
at the experimental stage.

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:22.964
I attended one demonstration recently
at the laboratory in Potsdam

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:27.727
where ten disabled children were
each given a red balloon to play with,

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:31.884
and then injected in the heart
with a solution of concentrated phenol.

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:36.848
- I beg your pardon?
- Phenol.

01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:41.288
You probably know it as carbolic acid.
It's easily soluble.

01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:43.521
The children look as if they have passed
away in their sleep,

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:46.967
but the doctor and his assistant,
who are both very skilled,

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:50.122
could only manage ten in a minute.

01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:53.920
So I fear it's hardly practical
on the scale we may eventually need.

01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:14.443
Will you take some brandy
and a cigar, <i>Herr</i> Himmler?

01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:19.640
Yes, yes!

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:26.728
Yes, and I will show you my collection
of P.G. Wodehouse first editions.

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:32.999
I'm afraid I must go.
I have an early start tomorrow.

01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:49.962
We have an understanding, I think?

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:51.928
Indeed, we do.

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:13.167
Brandt, they are the rule.
You are the exception.

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:23.126
You let me know the minute the pastor
gives you anything.

01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.679
Ah, good to see you finally
taking an interest, Brandt.

01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:45.090
You were wonderful.

01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:47.082
I was very proud of you.

01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:35.288
You are a bloody fool, Sigurd.
You almost ruined everything.

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.964
Colonel.

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.249
I've been wondering something.

01:22:55.850 --> 01:23:00.925
Can an officer have a loyalty
to anything greater than his country?

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:07.400
First, he must answer the question...

01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:12.406
"What is my country...

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:14.322
and does it even still exist?"

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:17.799
Hmm.

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.924
The offer His Highness received
tonight from Himmler...

01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.888
It's a trap.

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:31.723
They want to know who secretly
supports the restoration.

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:37.690
I trust you will inform
His Highness accordingly.

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:43.043
If you'll excuse me.

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.160
Captain?

01:23:58.530 --> 01:23:59.725
Thank you.

01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:21.848
Is something wrong?

01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:26.004
- I have to go now. Forever.
- Oh...

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:28.690
But first I... I have a message for you.

01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:34.122
From Winston Churchill.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.286
Of course you do.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:47.722
You're the secret agent.

01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:54.965
Marvelous.

01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:01.730
<i>Help!</i>

01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:06.920
<i>Help!</i>

01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:11.845
Help!

01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:15.288
Help!

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:17.248
It's the Kaiser,
he's collapsed in the clearing!

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:19.162
No, get him to hospital now!

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:32.083
What happened? Is he dead?

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:33.809
We spoke and then I left.

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:35.927
I saw him pick up his axe and he just fell.

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.241
- You should have gone hours ago.
- I know, I'll go now.

01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:43.519
Brandt.

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:50.720
I'll find her.

01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:55.690
Gestapo. They know.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.162
They are coming for you now.
You'll never make it.

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:10.488
Mieke, trust me.

01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:22.763
It's Brandt. Listen.

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.240
One of the female servants is an enemy agent.

01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:28.323
Get all the men out.
Seal off the exits and the perimeter.

01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:31.642
And nobody, nobody gets in or out
of the grounds without my permission.

01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:33.222
Clear?

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:50.006
I'm perfectly well.
Just a little dizzy, that's...

01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:52.127
I'm fine now. I'm fine now.

01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:55.169
I'm all right, I'm all right.
Please, don't fuss!

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:59.290
I have told you so many times
not to exercise so after dinner.

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:01.869
I must remember that. Huh?

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:06.401
You... you won't believe...

01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:12.202
I... I just received a message
from Britain's Prime Minister.

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:15.727
- The boy, Churchill.
- What? What message?

01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:17.005
What?

01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:19.924
He was offering me exile in England,

01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:25.560
and then, when the war ends,
the throne of a defeated Germany.

01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:29.290
Imagine that! Two offers in one night.

01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:31.965
Not bad, huh? After 20 years.

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:36.249
- Oh!
- Wilhelm, please, please rest.

01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:37.684
Rest.

01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:42.003
Of course, I was very polite.
I said, "No, thank you."

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.242
Of course. Please rest. Rest.

01:27:45.370 --> 01:27:47.089
Sigurd will be here in a moment.

01:27:47.170 --> 01:27:50.368
- Hermine.
- Hmm?

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.407
There's something I must tell you.

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:56.286
I shall not return to Berlin.

01:27:57.770 --> 01:28:01.480
I shall stay here with you...

01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.725
And I will never leave.

01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:11.999
Was it tonight? That dreadful man?

01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:15.800
I should never have brought him here.
Oh, I am such a fool.

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:19.406
No, no, no! Thank God, I'm grateful to you.

01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:21.761
But they are not all like Himmler.

01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:25.685
You will talk to the <i>Führer,</i>
and the man must be dismissed.

01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:28.080
- Something must be done.
- No, nothing can be done.

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:32.926
No, they are not as we are, as anyone is.

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:35.241
We had to know that, and now we do.

01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:39.404
Oh! Look at me.

01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:42.728
My love.

01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:48.722
It's God's will. All of it.

01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:51.206
No. How can that be?

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:57.087
And I'm content. I must be.

01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:04.801
- Truly?
- Truly.

01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:11.165
Then so am I.

01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:36.844
It's that new servant girl.

01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:51.320
- He has chest pains.
- Dr. Krahl is coming.

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:53.527
- Don't fuss, Sigurd. Don't fuss.
- Quick, help!

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.160
Careful.

01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:59.242
- Don't...
- To the house.

01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:02.323
- The doctor is coming.
- Don't fuss, Sigurd. Don't fuss.

01:30:02.410 --> 01:30:04.129
- Careful.
- Yes. Yes.

01:30:04.210 --> 01:30:06.281
Just put me to bed, that's all.

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:20.845
- Captain, open the door.
- He needs the hospital.

01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:23.570
- Open the door!
- Brandt, the doctor is coming here.

01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:25.642
- Follow me.
- Brandt!

01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:30.920
But wait! I need to go with him!

01:30:57.250 --> 01:30:59.481
Mieke. Mieke!

01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:09.721
The Gestapo's coming for her.

01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:11.688
Well, get her in. Quick!

01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:21.770
Why did you wait so long?

01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:25.480
Did you think I was going
to turn you over to the Gestapo?

01:31:25.570 --> 01:31:28.039
Well, of course, that's exactly
what I should have done.

01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:39.842
Halt!

01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:42.081
Open the gate, damn you!

01:31:42.170 --> 01:31:43.889
We're looking for an enemy agent.

01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:46.644
Ah, so are we! Open the fucking gate!

01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:49.086
Oh, Christ. They're here already.

01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:52.523
Mieke, give me your gun, now.

01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:56.400
Mieke!

01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:05.285
- Mueller, get that gate open.
- Sir.

01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:11.649
Move that car out of the way now!

01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:12.846
Where do you think you're going?

01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:15.087
Hospital. The Kaiser's in the back,
he's had a heart attack.

01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:19.130
- Our priority is the spy.
- Mine is his life.

01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:20.200
They've sealed the perimeter.

01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:22.680
Take my men and your cars
and start searching the house.

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:24.807
I'll be back in an hour.

01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:27.648
Get them up to the house!

01:32:27.730 --> 01:32:30.802
Oh, come along. Move that fucking car!

01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:32.563
Get moving!

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:44.646
- I'm checking the van.
- It's the Kaiser.

01:32:44.730 --> 01:32:46.323
Get out of the way.

01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:49.008
Ah, we'll just take a little look.

01:32:57.610 --> 01:32:58.600
No!

01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:29.160
Oh, Mieke.

01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:49.286
You saved my life.

01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:57.689
I'm glad we had the chance to say goodbye.

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.400
I shall miss you.

01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:16.686
Such beautiful hands.

01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:28.801
Your Highness.

01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:30.701
Your Highness?

01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:34.009
Your Highness.

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:39.685
Brandt! Brandt!

01:34:48.650 --> 01:34:50.801
He's just asleep.

01:35:11.490 --> 01:35:15.120
- You've got somewhere to go?
- An address. Will you come with me?

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:18.803
I betrayed my country,
but I won't abandon it.

01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.121
Oh, Brandt, please, you'll be shot!

01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:26.090
I left two Gestapo officers to guard
the gate and took the Kaiser to hospital.

01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:28.589
The enemy agent killed them and escaped.

01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:36.444
Don't be sad.

01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:41.082
I found something else to fight for.

01:35:48.130 --> 01:35:49.450
Me too.

01:36:13.570 --> 01:36:16.085
I...

01:36:19.090 --> 01:36:21.559
I know.

01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:33.085
But will you marry me?

01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:43.083
Come and find me after the war.

01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:45.920
Is that a yes?

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:49.604
Of course!

01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:20.560
Has she gone?

01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:32.924
Thank you.

01:38:29.050 --> 01:38:30.769
From the Red Cross.

01:39:43.650 --> 01:39:48.202
Your Highness, Captain Brandt
sent a message from Berlin.

01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:52.599
He has good news.

01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:55.928
Thank you, Sigurd.

01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:00.723
Of course he has.

01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:11.766
There you are.

01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:14.046
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

01:40:14.130 --> 01:40:15.928
The Prime Minister will see you now.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.763
Oh...

01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:19.443
Thank you.
