00:06.940 --> 00:08.532
[gunshot]

00:10.710 --> 00:13.702
[suspenseful music]

00:15.380 --> 00:17.371
- YOU KNOW, GUS...
I'M GONNA WANNA OPEN

00:17.410 --> 00:19.810
AN OLD-FASHIONED ICE CREAM
SHOPPE AT SOME POINT.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.772
- THIS IS BECAUSE
OF JULIET, ISN'T IT?

00:21.820 --> 00:23.310
EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH
INTO THIS DREAM

00:23.350 --> 00:24.715
ABOUT OPENING
AN ICE CREAM STORE...

00:24.750 --> 00:25.682
- SHOPPE.
- SHOPPE.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.711
IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S
SOME ISSUE WITH JULIET.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.081
PSYCHIATRISTS CALL IT
DIVERSION CODING.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.693
[screams, gunshot]

00:37.570 --> 00:39.765
THIS IS BECAUSE
SHE'S DATING DECLAN NOW.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.630
- I WOULDN'T CALL IT DATING.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.308
- WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT?
- DATING.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.807
I JUST DON'T WANNA SAY IT.
COME ON, GUS.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.172
THE GUY LIES HIS ASS OFF
ABOUT EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE,

00:46.210 --> 00:47.734
THEN HE JUST APOLOGIZES

00:47.780 --> 00:49.247
AND THAT GETS HIM
RIGHT OFF THE HOOK.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.770
- SHAWN, SHE
REALLY LIKES THIS GUY.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.072
WHY ARE YOU
TRYING TO POKE A HOLE

00:52.120 --> 00:53.269
INTO SOMETHING
THAT'S WORKING FOR HER?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.413
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.338
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.812
IF SHE WANTS
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

00:58.850 --> 01:00.852
WITH A FILTHY RICH GUY
WHO ADORES HER...

01:00.890 --> 01:03.085
SO BE IT.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.428
BUT NOT THIS GUY.
NO, SIR.

01:05.460 --> 01:08.190
MY SPIRIT HAS
TO REMAIN UNCHAINED, GUS.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.299
LIKE MY MELODIES.
- WOW.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.094
- BE AVAILABLE
FOR ANY OPPORTUNITY.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.734
- OPPORTUNITY?
- YES, GUS, OPPORTUNITY.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.806
WITH A WOMAN LIKE THAT.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.139
[dramatic music]

01:20.180 --> 01:21.204
*

01:21.240 --> 01:22.741
SHE'S MAKING EYES WITH ME.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.305
- SHE HAS EYES, YES.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.341
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME.
- GUS, DON'T BE ABSURD.

01:27.380 --> 01:28.642
SHE'S LOOKING
DIRECTLY AT ME.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.739
SHE'S PIERCING
MY MEDIUMLY DEFINED CHEST

01:30.790 --> 01:32.815
WITH HER
STARK BEDROOM PEEPERS.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.749
- THAT LADY IS TRYING TO
UNDRESS ME WITH HER EYES, SHAWN.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.451
- MAYBE SHE'S DRESSING YOU.
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

01:37.490 --> 01:39.196
COVER UP YOUR CANKLES?
- PLEASE.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.891
I HAVE THE ANKLES
OF A STALLION.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.818
AND THAT WOMAN WANTS THEM.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.862
- THAT WOMAN HAS A GUN.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.458
- SHE'S ALL YOURS.
I'M OU'I'I'A HERE.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.634
- DROP YOUR CONE!

01:55.680 --> 01:57.807
- I'M NOT DROPPING MY CONE.
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

01:57.850 --> 01:59.670
- I DON'T WANNA DIE
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, BARRY.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.813
- WHO IS BARRY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.314
WHAT DO WE DO WHEN
WE GET TO THE END OF THE PIER?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.214
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK BARRY?

02:16.900 --> 02:19.266
DON'T KILL US.
PLEASE.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.892
- I'M NOT HERE TO KILL YOU.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.168
IN FACT, I NEED YOUR HELP.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.405
- WHO ARE YOU?
- MY NAME IS NADIA.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.907
I WORK WITH EWAN O'HARA.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.578
- YOU KNOW
JULIET'S BROTHER?

02:27.610 --> 02:28.907
- WE WERE OPERATIVES
TOGETHER.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.374
I'VE BEEN SET UP
AND I'M ON THE RUN.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.549
EWAN TOLD ME ABOUT YOU.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.877
HE WAS IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR SKILLS.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.785
- YOU'RE NOT KIDDING?
YOU'RE REALLY A SPY?

02:36.820 --> 02:37.844
THIS--THIS IS FOR REAL?

02:37.890 --> 02:39.585
- YEAH, THIS IS FOR REAL.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.588
- SO YOU WEREN'T UNDRESSING
HIM WITH YOUR EYES EARLIER?

02:41.620 --> 02:42.655
SEE, I TOLD YOU.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.248
- LISTEN,
I HAVE VERY LI'I'I'LE TIME.

02:44.290 --> 02:48.454
I NEED TO BE ERASED.
TO DISAPPEAR.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.660
- UH...

02:49.700 --> 02:51.668
HOW DO YOU EXPECT US
TO HELP YOU DO THAT?

02:51.700 --> 02:53.338
- MY MENTOR
AND MOST TRUSTED ALLY--

02:53.370 --> 02:54.667
CODE NAME: STRABINSKY--

02:54.700 --> 02:56.907
WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO
SUCCESSFULLY ERASED HIMSELF.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.567
HE HAS THE TOOLS.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.532
O'HARA SAID
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T EXIST,

03:00.580 --> 03:02.343
YOU'D BE
THE PERSON TO FIND HIM.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.977
WILL YOU HELP ME?

03:05.010 --> 03:07.649
- WELL, I CAN
ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF,

03:07.680 --> 03:09.318
BUT A FEW SECONDS AGO,
I THOUGHT WE WERE

03:09.350 --> 03:10.886
GONNA HAVE TO
JUMP OFF THIS PIER, SO.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.649
- YEAH.
WE CAN HELP YOU.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.453
- OKAY.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.253
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.450
THEY'RE FOLLOWING ME.

03:17.490 --> 03:18.650
THEY COULD
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.897
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, THERE'S
NO REASON TO BE SO DRAMATIC.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.625
- I MEAN, COME ON.
- WE GET IT, YOU'RE A SPY.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.365
AND THINGS ARE
HEIGHTENED FOR YOU PEOPLE.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.891
BUT COME ON, WE'RE A LITTLE MORE
LAID-BACK IN SANTA BARBARA.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.794
THIS IS A BEACH COMMUNITY.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.707
[helicopter whirring]

03:40.650 --> 03:41.878
- AH.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.582

-AH!

03:50.630 --> 03:51.927

03:51.960 --> 03:53.598

THE TRUTH *

03:53.630 --> 03:55.291
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:55.330 --> 03:57.366
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

03:57.400 --> 03:58.867
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

03:58.900 --> 04:00.538
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:00.570 --> 04:01.867
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:01.900 --> 04:04.664
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT

04:11.550 --> 04:13.518
- HOW ARE THOSE
STALLION ANKLES NOW, BUDDY?

04:13.550 --> 04:16.644
- WHERE IS SHE, SHAWN?

04:18.620 --> 04:20.451
- GET OVER HERE.

04:20.490 --> 04:23.482
GET OUT OF
THE LINE OF SIGHT.

04:25.530 --> 04:26.519
- COME ON.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.563
[helicopter blades whirring]

04:34.600 --> 04:35.897
- WHERE
THE HELL DID SHE GO?

04:35.940 --> 04:38.033
- UNDERNEATH THE PIER, SIR.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.607
- HOW THE HELL DID
WE LOSE HER?

04:40.640 --> 04:43.609
- COME AROUND THE OTHER SIDE.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.985
- OKAY, GREAT.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.908
WHAT'S YOUR GENIUS PLAN
TO GET US OUT OF HERE NOW?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.689
- LISTEN, YOU TWO...

04:56.730 --> 04:58.721
FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE
GONNA DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.557
- WHO ARE
THOSE GUYS SHE'S WITH?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.319
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.621
PUT THIS THING DOWN.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.399
WE GO'ITA GET TO HER
FROM THE GROUND.

05:11.740 --> 05:14.675
[phone ringing]

05:14.710 --> 05:16.029
- LASSIE, WHAT'S UP?
- SPENCER.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.469
I JUST GOT A CALL ABOUT
A WHITE GUY AND A BLACK GUY

05:18.510 --> 05:19.374
RUNNING DOWN THE BOARDWALK,
WREAKING HAVOC,

05:19.420 --> 05:20.648
AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT
OF YOU GUYS.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.840
ARE YOU INVOLVED?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.586
- DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SAID HAVOC.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.383
- WHAT ABOUT THE REPORT
OF A BLACK OPS HELICOPTER

05:25.420 --> 05:26.819
CIRCLING THE BAY,
FIRING OFF SHOTS?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.556
- HELICOPTER IN
SANTA BARBARA, FIRING SHOTS?

05:29.590 --> 05:31.080
LASSIE, PLEASE.
GO TO THE MEN'S BATHROOM.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.553
BEHIND THE CONDOM MACHINE
IS A VIAL OF SANITY SERUM.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.420
CRACK IT, DIGEST,
CALL ME IN HALF AN HOUR.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.564
BUT DON'T--

05:47.640 --> 05:48.834
- THIS IS
A WOMEN'S BATHROOM.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.043
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BE IN HERE.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.672
- GET DOWN,
AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.583
- DUDE...

05:58.620 --> 06:01.783
PURPLE OCT OPUS,
12:00.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.651
- SHAWN,
YOU NEED TO FOCUS.

06:03.690 --> 06:05.624
- OKAY, THIS IS THE DEAL.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.696
I WAS IN KIEV SEVERAL YEARS AGO
WITH STRABINSKY.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.698
IT WAS AN N.Q.K. MISSION.
- N.Q.K.?

06:09.730 --> 06:12.119
- NO QUESTIONS KILL MISSION.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.489
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.666
HE TOLD ME THE DAY
WOULD COME

06:14.700 --> 06:16.804
THAT WE WOULD NEED
TO CUT TIES AND GO DARK.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.535
NEXT MORNING,
HE HAD ERASED HIMSELF

06:18.570 --> 06:21.676
AND DROPPED OFF THE GRID.

06:21.710 --> 06:22.745
I FOUND THIS
IN MY BACKPACK.

06:22.780 --> 06:23.678
HE LEFI' IT THERE.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.644
I BELIEVE IT WAS A CLUE
FOR ME TO FIND HIM

06:25.680 --> 06:27.773
IF I EVER NEEDED HIS HELP.
- NADIA, THIS IS BLANK.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.583
- TOUCH IT.
- WHAT IS IT, BRAILLE?

06:29.620 --> 06:31.645
- I DON'T THINK_IT'S BRAILLE.
[knocking]

06:31.690 --> 06:32.611
- HELLO? UGH.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.480
WHY'S IT
LOCKED DURING THE DAY?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.420
- THESE IMPRESSIONS
ARE IN A FORMATION, SHAWN.

06:36.460 --> 06:39.623
I THINK THIS HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH CELESTIAL PATTERNS.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.457
STARS.
- I GOT SOMETHING.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.821
SOMETHING
HELPFUL AND IMPRESSIVE.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.895
I SEE STRABINSKY
IN THE SKY.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.490
POSSIBLY WITH DIAMONDS.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.632
- PLEASE
MAKE SOME SENSE SOON.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.104
- DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT
GIANT ASTRONOMY COLORING BOOK

06:52.140 --> 06:53.573
BACK IN THE PSYCH OFFICE?

06:53.610 --> 06:54.679
- IT'S NOT A COLORING BOOK.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.678
- UH-OH.

06:56.710 --> 06:59.008
HE'S GONNA
BE SO MAD AT ME.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.787
- REMEMBER,
WE HAVE T-MINUS SIX MINUTES

07:05.820 --> 07:08.209
BEFORE A TEAM OF BLACK OPS
CLOSE IN AND TORTURE TO KILL.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.659
- TORTURE TO KILL?

07:09.690 --> 07:10.486
IS THAT PRE'ITY CUT AND DRY,

07:10.530 --> 07:13.658
OR IS THERE
SOME WIGGLE ROOM THERE?

07:13.700 --> 07:15.554
- UH, NADIA,
I HAVE FLOOR PADS

07:15.600 --> 07:17.227
AS TO AVOID THE SCRATCHING
OF HARDWOOD FLOORS.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.659
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.099
- YES, I AM.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.608
[softly screeching]

07:23.640 --> 07:27.132
NADIA, THAT'S GONNA
COST US $438 PLUS TAX--

07:27.180 --> 07:28.977
NEVER MIND.

07:46.860 --> 07:47.849
- BOOM!

07:47.900 --> 07:49.959
PHOENIX CONSTELLATION.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.991
DAMN IT, THAT MEANS
STRABINSKY'S IN ALABAMA.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.566
- YOU MEAN ARIZONA?
- NO.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.158
HE ALWAYS TALKED
ABOUT RETIRING HERE.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.736
THIS MUCH I KNOW FOR SURE.

07:56.770 --> 07:58.601
ANOTHER REASON WHY
O'HARA THOUGHT YOU COULD HELP.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.733
- WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.509
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH CONSTELLATIONS.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.505
- GET DOWN.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.802
- IT'S JUST A CLUE
TO GET US TO THE LOCATION.

08:05.850 --> 08:08.648
F-E-N-I-X,
THE FENIX VALLEY PATH.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.080
IT'S IN THE LOS PADRES FOREST,
JUST OUTSIDE OF SANTA BARBARA.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.656
- GUS, YOU CAN'T JUST
MAKE UP STUFF

08:12.690 --> 08:14.954
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
- IT DOES EXIST, SHAWN.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.548
IT'S JUST
NOT IN ANY GUIDEBOOKS.

08:16.590 --> 08:17.887
IT'S NAMED AFTER
A HIKER WHO GOT LOST THERE.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.921
- OH.
WELL, THAT'S IT, THEN.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.621
THAT'S WHERE
WE'LL FIND STRABINSKY.

08:21.660 --> 08:22.524
- THAT'S
WHAT I JUST SAID.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.720
BUT THE LOS PADRES FOREST
IS TOO BIG.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.567
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK THROUGH
THERE AND FIND STRABINSKY.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.760
- WE HAVE TO FLY OVER.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.529
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO OWNS A CHOPPER?

08:29.570 --> 08:31.561
- 99.6% OF THE TIME,

08:31.610 --> 08:34.636
THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION IS NOBODY.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.103
BUT THERE'S ONE GUY.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.039
[knocking]

08:45.090 --> 08:46.910
- I SHOULD
BE CONCERNED, RIGHT?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.609
- CONCERNED AND EXCITED.

08:48.660 --> 08:49.820
- REALLY BAD TIMING.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.088
- DECLAN,
WE'RE BEING TRACKED.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.620
WHICH MEANS
IN ABOUT SEVEN-ISH MINUTES,

08:52.660 --> 08:54.651
DUDES IN CAPES
ARE GONNA STORM YOUR DOPE PAD

08:54.700 --> 08:56.258
AND START SNIPING US.
- THEY WILL NOT BE

08:56.300 --> 08:58.723
WEARING CAPES,
BUT THEY WILL BE SNIPING US.

08:58.770 --> 08:59.668
- DECLAN, THIS IS NADIA,
SHE IS A SPY.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.191
THE CASE WE'RE
WORKING ON IS A MATTER OF

09:02.240 --> 09:05.562
NATIONAL, INTERNATIONAL,
AND GUBERNATIONAL SECURITY.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.134
- OKAY, OKAY,
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY LONG.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.205
- DA, DA, DA--NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT BEING TRACKED, NADIA.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.172
- WHY'S THAT?

09:10.210 --> 09:12.041
- I OWN THE AIR RIGHTS
FOR THE WHOLE BLOCK.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.672
I CAN SCRAMBLE
THE STRONGEST OF SIGNALS.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.870
NOW UNFORTUNATELY, WHATEVER
YOU GUYS ARE INVOLVED IN,

09:15.920 --> 09:17.649
I DON'T THINK I CAN
ASSIST YOU ON THIS ONE.

09:17.690 --> 09:18.611
- LISTEN, JUST HEAR US OUT.
- NO, NO, NO.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.208
- WE NEED YOU TO SPONSOR US.
- SORRY, GUYS.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.659
BUT EVER SINCE
I ADMITI'ED TO JULIET

09:21.690 --> 09:23.624
THAT I'M NOT
A REAL CRIMINAL PROFILER,

09:23.660 --> 09:25.651
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T
ASSIST ON ANY POLICE CASES

09:25.690 --> 09:26.657
WHATSOEVER.
- WHO'S JULIET?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.998
- THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
- WOW.

09:29.030 --> 09:31.260
JUST DROPPING THE G-BOMB
WITH RECKLESS ABANDON, HUH?

09:31.300 --> 09:32.938
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:32.970 --> 09:34.335
YOU ARE MISSING
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY HERE.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.292
AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUMP
RIGHT INTO A BOURNE FILM.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.898
- THIS IS NOT A MOVIE.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.976
THIS IS REALITY, AND
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

09:40.010 --> 09:41.329
- LOOK, GUYS,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

09:41.380 --> 09:43.041
I'D KILL TO GET MYSELF
KNEECAP DEEP IN THIS THING.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.775
BUT I'M TRYING TO PLAY
THE HONESTY CARD,

09:44.810 --> 09:47.711
SO NO LIES, PERIOD.
- DEC, I'M SORRY,

09:47.750 --> 09:50.787
BUT I THINK I JUST
USED THE LAST OF YOUR SHAMPOO.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.653
SHAWN. GUS.
- SORRY, BUNNY,

09:53.690 --> 09:55.214
THEY JUST STOPPED BY.
BUT THEY'RE LEAVING NOW.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.320
- [inhales]
I SEE WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.123
JULIET WAS
DRIVING IN THE AREA,

10:00.160 --> 10:01.752
SHE SPILLED
SOMETHING ON HERSELF,

10:01.800 --> 10:04.394
SHE DROPPED BY AND ASKED
IF SHE COULD USE THE FACILITIES.

10:04.430 --> 10:07.695
- NO, SHAWN.
I SLEPT HERE.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.093
AND THEN I WOKE UP HERE.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.404
AND THEN I TOOK A SHOWER.
- YES.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.704
THE OLD CRASHING IN
THE GUEST ROOM ROUTINE.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.002
- I AM SORRY,
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.644
- NADIA.
HER NAME IS NADIA.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.704
AND WE HAVE CHEMISTRY.

10:19.250 --> 10:23.209
- OKAY, SHAWN, GUS,
WOMAN IN LEATHER...

10:23.250 --> 10:24.740
ENJOY THE REST
OF YOUR WEEKEND.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.246
- CAN WE PLEASE
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS?

10:26.290 --> 10:27.655
- YES, OF COURSE.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.317
DECLAN, CAN WE
BORROW YOUR CHOPPER OR WHAT?

10:29.360 --> 10:30.384
- YEAH,
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.783
I NEED IT BACK TONIGHT.
- TONIGHT?

10:31.830 --> 10:33.695
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE, THIS COMING NIGHT?

10:33.730 --> 10:36.119
- YEAH, I'M DRIVING JULIET
TO NAPA FOR DINNER,

10:36.160 --> 10:37.923
AND SURPRISING HER
WITH A VACATION PLAN--

10:37.970 --> 10:40.689
THE AMALFI COAST.
- AMALFI COAST? OOH, BRO.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.662
[inhales]
I'D PULL BACK.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.007
STEP ON THE BRAKES
IF I WAS YOU, MAN.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.337
IF I KNOW ONE THING
ABOUT JULES,

10:45.370 --> 10:48.168
IS THAT SHE LIKES
TO ROUGH IT ON HER VACAYS.

10:48.210 --> 10:49.677
- HMM, YEAH,
I WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED THAT.

10:49.710 --> 10:50.745
- REALLY?

10:50.780 --> 10:53.772
IT'S TRUE, SHE'S A HUNTER,
GATHERER, WOODSWOMAN.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.811
TENTS, BEANS, AND BUGS,
THAT'S HOW SHE DOES IT.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.114
- WE CAN HAVE THE CHOPPER BACK
IN TWO, THREE HOURS, TOPS.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.285
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT SHOULD WORK.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.958
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY,
I'M JUST LOANING YOU A CHOPPER

11:03.990 --> 11:05.127
TO FLY FROM
POINT "A" TO POINT "B."

11:05.160 --> 11:07.196
- AND LOANING US
YOUR PILOT TOO.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.869
- OH, I AM THE PILOT.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.534
DAMN, THIS IS GOOD FUN.

11:14.570 --> 11:17.437
IT'S SO MUCH MORE SATISFYING
THAN THE REMOTE CONTROL VERSION.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.700
- WE HAVE
TO FIND STRABINSKY SOON.

11:19.740 --> 11:21.469
JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY FIGURE OUT

11:21.510 --> 11:23.774
WE'RE IN AN AIRPLANE AND
SEND AN F-14 TO SHOOT US DOWN.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.209
- WHAT?
WE'RE GONNA GET SHOT DOWN?

11:28.980 --> 11:30.242
- WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.211
WE'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.411
THIS IS IT.
BRING THIS BIRDIE DOWN, DECLAN.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.950
- YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.379
BUT HOLD ON TIGHT.
LANDING'S DICEY AT BEST FOR ME.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.886
- HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
FLYING YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

11:38.930 --> 11:40.352
- UH, NO,
THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.254
NO, I JUST GOT MY PILOT'S
LICENSE THREE DAYS AGO.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.426
- WHAT?

11:52.170 --> 11:54.900
- KNOCK, KNOCK.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.749
- WHO'S THERE?
- IS IT A KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE?

11:56.780 --> 11:57.974
- MUST BE
SOME KIND OF SPY CODE.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.204
- NADIA.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.172
- I GUESS NOT.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.746
- NADIA.
- STRABINSKY.

12:06.490 --> 12:10.483
[speaking German]
- [speaking German]

12:10.530 --> 12:12.452
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
- LAST TIME I SAW YOU,

12:12.490 --> 12:14.424
YOU WERE FOUR CLICKS
OUTSIDE OF MOZAMBIQUE.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.520
- MM, MOZAMBIQUE.
TORTURED BY PYGMIES.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.767
WELL, GET IN HERE.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.268
COME ON INSIDE.

12:27.540 --> 12:30.179
WELL...

12:30.210 --> 12:31.973
WELCOME
TO MY HIDDEN ABODE.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.069
WOULD YOU
LIKE A QUICK TOUR?

12:34.120 --> 12:35.974
[chuckles]
I JOKE.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.442
IT'S A JOKE.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.946
GET IT?
- [chuckles]

12:38.990 --> 12:40.309
- SORRY
ABOUT THE HEAT IN HERE,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.112
BUT THE SUPER
HYDRA DRIVES ARE LIKE OVENS.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.151
SUCK UP POWER
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

12:44.190 --> 12:45.452
HEY, CAN I ASK
YOU ALL A QUICK FAVOR

12:45.490 --> 12:47.048
BEFORE WE
GET THIS PARTY STARTED?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.419
- YOU WANT US
TO TAKE OUR SHOES OFF?

12:48.460 --> 12:50.496
- NO, I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME WHY YOU'RE HERE

12:50.530 --> 12:52.896
IN THE NEXT TEN SECONDS,
OR ELSE I'M GONNA KILL YOU ALL.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.498
- WAIT, WAIT,
CALM DOWN, STRABINSKY.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.929
I FOUND YOU USING THE CARD
YOU LEFI' IN MY BACKPACK.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.029
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO CUT TIES.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.300
NADIA,
YOU ARE BEING TRACKED.

13:01.340 --> 13:02.375
YOU PUT ME IN JEOPARDY.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.503
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT
TOOK ME TO FIND THIS PLACE?

13:04.550 --> 13:06.040
TO SET IT UP?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.547
THAT DOOR YOU CAME THROUGH?
THAT'S CUSTOM.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.810
TRANSLATION:
IT'S NOT FROM HOME DEPOT.

13:09.850 --> 13:11.511
- I'M SORRY, BUT--
- BUT NOTHING.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.359
IT TOOK ME A WEEK
TO PUT IN THAT DOOR.

13:13.390 --> 13:14.414
AND THEN YOU
BRING IN TWO CIWIES HERE,

13:14.460 --> 13:16.553
AND THERE'S A JACK SNAPPER
OUT THERE IN A CHOPPER.

13:16.590 --> 13:19.388
- I'M A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE,
SO THAT TECHNICALLY MEANS

13:19.430 --> 13:22.058
I'M NO LONGER
A CIWY, IF YOU WILL.

13:22.100 --> 13:26.469
- I WILL SNUFF YOU OUT
WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING YOU.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.434
- HARSH.
INTIMIDATING.

13:28.470 --> 13:31.268
INTRIGUING HOW YOU WOULD
ACTUALLY SNUFF WITHOUT TOUCHING.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.607
BUT ALSO FAIR.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.608
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I AM BEING TRACKED.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.575
SO WILL YOU
ERASE ME OR NOT?

13:38.610 --> 13:42.842
- NADIA, YOU HAVE
BEEN A BUSY, BUSY BEE.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.916
I'M JUST ABOUT DONE HERE
DELETING ALL YOUR MISSION FIL--

13:45.950 --> 13:47.417
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.052
DON'T DELETE
OPERATION MITLU-BOLIVIA.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.227
OPEN THAT ONE.

13:50.260 --> 13:55.254
[beeps]

13:55.300 --> 13:57.621
- I CAN'T OPEN THAT FILE,
THAT'S GOT SPECIAL SECURITY.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.592
- SERIOUSLY, OPEN IT.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.600
- OKAY, MAYBE I WAS UNCLEAR,
OR I SPOKE SUPER-DUPER FAST,

14:03.640 --> 14:05.528
OR SWITCHED LANGUAGES,
OR SOMETHING.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.299
BUT I CAN'T OPEN THIS FILE.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.501
- I KNOW YOU
CAN OPEN THE FILE.

14:09.540 --> 14:10.438
OPEN IT!

14:10.480 --> 14:12.971
- THIS FEELS LIKE
AN OLD SCHOOL SPY TIFF

14:13.020 --> 14:15.443
THAT DESERVES SOME PRIVACY.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.348
- DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

14:19.390 --> 14:20.414
- WHAT IS OPERATION MITLU?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.883
- OPEN IT!

14:22.930 --> 14:25.581
- OH, YEAH, WAIT A SECOND.
BOLIVIA.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.120
I REMEMBER HEARING SOMETHING

14:27.160 --> 14:29.594
OVER THE AGENCY WIRE
ABOUT THAT.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.120
THE EMBASSY WAS BROKEN INTO.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.569
A COUPLE OF DIPLOMATS
WERE KILLED

14:32.600 --> 14:35.364
AND SOMEONE MADE OFF
WITH A SUITCASE OF GCCs.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.439
- WHAT ARE GCCs?
- GLOBAL CURRENCY CERTIFICATES.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.506
YOU CAN CASH THEM IN FOR
ANY CURRENCY AROUND THE WORLD.

14:41.540 --> 14:44.600
IT'S LIKE LITERALLY
HAVING A MONEY PRINTING PRESS.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.140
- [scoffs]

14:46.180 --> 14:47.579
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT, HUH, NADIA?

14:47.620 --> 14:51.181
YOU USED MY INCREDIBLE GIFI'S
TO GET YOURSELF ERASED

14:51.220 --> 14:53.051
SO THAT YOU COULD GO
RETIRE SOMEWHERE EXOTIC

14:53.090 --> 14:55.308
IN THE WORLD
WITH A BUNCH OF GCCS?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.055
- YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE
TO OPEN THE FILE, STRABINSKY.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.627
- GO AHEAD, SHOOT ME.
I CAN'T OPEN THIS FILE.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.220
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.397
THE ONLY WAY
TO OPEN A FILE THIS SECURE

15:03.430 --> 15:06.365
IS ON A LEVEL THREE COMPUTER
IN A GOVERNMENT BUILDING.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.109
- WHO DID
WE JUST HELP ERASE?

15:15.140 --> 15:17.108
- A VERY CAPABLE KILLER.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.443
- SHAWN, IT'S MY DAY OFF.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.549
I HAD A COLD BEER IN MY HAND,
I'M ON MY BOAT,

15:26.590 --> 15:29.309
AND LITERALLY HAD
MY FISHING LINE IN THE WATER

15:29.360 --> 15:31.385
WHEN I GOT THIS CALL.
- DAD, DOES CHIEF VICK KNOW

15:31.430 --> 15:33.625
THAT YOU'RE SITTING IN HER CHAIR
WHILE SHE'S ON HOLIDAY?

15:33.660 --> 15:35.696
- I AM IN NO MOOD.
- I'M JUST SAYING

15:35.730 --> 15:37.721
YOUR NAKED THIGHS
ARE TOUCHING THE FABRIC THERE.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.192
DON'T YOU THINK SHE'D
BE A LITTLE WEIRDED OUT?

15:39.230 --> 15:41.289
- SORRY, GUYS.
NO CHOICE.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.739
I MADE A PROMISE TO JULIET

15:42.770 --> 15:45.261
SO I HAD TO COME CLEAN,
AND I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING.

15:45.310 --> 15:46.129
- EVERYTHING?
- EVERYTHING.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.434
- YES, SHAWN,
I KNOW HE WAS WITH YOU.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.674
AND YOU GUYS
GOT IN OVER YOUR HEADS

15:49.710 --> 15:52.474
IN AN INTERNATIONAL CASE YOU HAD
NO BUSINESS BEING A PART OF.

15:52.510 --> 15:54.273
- BUT ON MY PART,
MOSTLY AS A PILOT.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.447
- YOU'RE A PILOT?
- OH, DID I LEAVE THAT PART OUT?

15:56.480 --> 15:57.583
IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.508
- NOW THE GUY DECIDES
TO HAVE A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE.

15:59.550 --> 16:01.108
- IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO CONFESS?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.378
- YES. THIS MORNING,
WHEN YOU FOUND THAT

16:03.430 --> 16:05.386
FRESH-SLICED GRAPEFRUIT
ON YOUR BEDSIDE TABLE,

16:05.430 --> 16:06.749
AND YOU ASKED ME
WHO PUT IT THERE,

16:06.790 --> 16:08.223
AND I SAID,
"THE GRAPEFRUIT FAIRY,"

16:08.260 --> 16:09.420
I WAS LYING.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.325
IT WAS ME.
- OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO CUTE.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.396
- PRETTY CUTE.
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SHAWN.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.067
WHERE IS THIS NADIA WOMAN?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.739
- I MEAN...

16:23.510 --> 16:24.477
LASSIE, GRAB THEM!

16:24.510 --> 16:27.115
GRAB THOSE--GRAB THOSE MEN.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.447
THESE ARE THE GUYS
THAT WERE IN THE HELICOPTER.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.640
THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT TRIED TO KILL US

16:29.680 --> 16:31.614
ON THE PIER THIS MORNING.
- I KNEW YOU WERE ON THAT PIER.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.789
- SHAWN, CALM DOWN.
THESE ARE THE GOOD GUYS.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.414
- AGENT CAMDEN DRIGGS,
SPECIAL DIVISION.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.382
DEPARTMENT OF CLANDESTINE
HUMAN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.488
THIS IS TOM.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.498
- YOU GET
THAT WHOLE SWANKY INTRO

16:41.530 --> 16:42.724
AND ALL HE GETS IS,
"THIS IS TOM?"

16:42.760 --> 16:44.523
- SENIOR
COMMUNICATIONS ANALYST

16:44.570 --> 16:46.595
IN CHARGE OF OPERATIVE
IN-CALL STATUS OBJECTIVES.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.632
SUBDIVISION SUPERVISOR,
TOM FONG.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.707
- I GET IT.
I GET "THIS IS TOM."

16:51.740 --> 16:53.628
- YOU GUYS ARE CIA?
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

16:53.680 --> 16:55.568
YOU WERE IN WASHINGTON, HMM--
YOUR EIGHTH GRADE FIELD TRIP?

16:55.610 --> 16:58.249
EVERYONE IN A SUIT
ISN'T CIA.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.770
WE'RE SPECIAL MILITARY OPS.
- MR. SPENCER,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.573
YOU ARE AWARE
THAT YOU HELPED AID AND ABET

17:01.620 --> 17:03.485
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST
DANGEROUS GOVERNMENT OPERATIVES?

17:03.520 --> 17:04.817
- WELL, WHEN
YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT

17:04.850 --> 17:06.340
IT MAKES IT SOUND
WAY WORSE THAN IT IS.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.312
- AND HOW WOULD
YOU PREFER I SAY IT?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.521
- INFLECTION IS EVERYTHING.
TRY IT AGAIN.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.357
MAYBE A LITTLE SINGSONGY.
- SHAWN.

17:12.390 --> 17:14.392
YOU WILL COOPERATE
WITH THESE MEN.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.557
- I WANNA KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT NADIA SAID TO YOU.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.058
I WANT YOU TO RETRACE EVERY STEP
YOU TOOK SINCE SHE MADE CONTACT.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.829
- AND WE KNOW ABOUT STRABINSKY.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.100
WHERE IS HE?
- OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.505
THAT MAN JUST
WANTS TO LIVE IN PEACE.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.429
HE GAVE 12 YEARS
OF HIS LIFE TO YOU ALL.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.448
- I'LL GIVE YOU
MY FLIGHT LOGS.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.449
GOD, THAT FELT GOOD.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.119
BEING OPEN AND HONEST.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.425
- GOOD JOB, SPENCER.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.335
YOU LED NADIA
RIGHT TO STRABINSKY

17:53.370 --> 17:54.530
AND NOW SHE TOOK HIM OUT.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.128
- SHE WAS
CLEANING UP HER TRACKS,

17:56.170 --> 17:58.229
ELIMINATING WITNESSES.
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

17:58.270 --> 17:59.237
THEN WHY ARE GUS AND I
STILL ALIVE?

17:59.270 --> 18:01.477
- BECAUSE YOU TWO
AREN'T WORTH ELIMINATING.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.171
- OH, WE'RE
WORTH ELIMINATING.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.201
- AGENT FONG,
CALL IN FOR AIR SUPPORT.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.445
I WANT THE REST OF YOU
TO FAN OUT ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.641
WE'VE GOT HOURS, NOT DAYS.
- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

18:09.680 --> 18:11.284
BUT INDUSTRY STANDARD
IS 18 HOURS.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.685
OTHERWISE WE CAN
KISS HER ASS GOOD-BYE.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.210
- THAT'S RIGHT, DETECTIVE.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.512
- WELL, I CAN FIND
THAT SPY IN 19 HOURS.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.289
_ THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION,
AND YOU WENT UP.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.423
- FINE, I CAN FIND
THAT SPY IN 13 HOURS.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.257
- SHAWN.
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU SHUT UP

18:22.300 --> 18:24.393
AND LET ME DO MY JOB, I'LL
FIND THAT SPY IN EIGHT HOURS.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.398
- OKAY.

18:26.430 --> 18:27.397
FIND THAT SPY.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.668
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
GET OUT OF HERE.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.361
BOTH OF YOU.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.537
GO SIT IN THE CHOPPER, I'M
TIRED OF LOOKING AT YOUR FACE.

18:32.570 --> 18:36.438
- [scoffs]

18:36.480 --> 18:39.540
- HEY, TOM FONG.
YOU COMING WITH?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.544
- LISTEN, SHAWN.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.515
IF THIS WOMAN HAS
ANY CONNECTION TO MY BROTHER...

18:45.550 --> 18:46.619
- COME ON, JULES.
- NO, SHAWN.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.208
I KNOW THAT
YOU WERE TAKEN BY HIM

18:48.260 --> 18:50.387
AND YOU GUYS SHARED
SOME SORT OF BOND OR SOMETHING.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.352
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET,
HE ELUDED AUTHORITIES

18:52.390 --> 18:53.596
AND EXISTS IN
MORE THAN A GRAY WORLD.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.723
- HOW MUCH MORE?
- THESE PEOPLE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.364
WATCH YOURSELF, SHAWN.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.163
THIS IS NOT A CASE
YOU SHOULD FOOL WITH.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.236
IT'S BIGGER THAN US.
- US?

19:01.270 --> 19:03.204
- THE DEPARTMENT.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.468
- OH, I'M SORRY,
AREN'T YOU TWO

19:04.510 --> 19:06.239
SUPPOSED TO BE
WAITING IN THE CHOPPER?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.306
- LASSIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:08.340 --> 19:10.376
YOU KNOW EVERY TIME THOSE
WASHINGTON GUYS COME TO TOWN,

19:10.410 --> 19:13.413
YOU TURN INTO A 14TH WHEEL.
LOOK AT TOM FONG.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.509
- GOT IT?
- PATCH ME THROUGH--

19:15.550 --> 19:17.279
- HE'S WEARING TWO WATCHES.
HOW YOU GONNA HANG WITH THAT?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.311
- SPENCER, YOU KNOW
NOTHING OF THESE PEOPLE.

19:19.350 --> 19:20.954
HE DOES THAT
SO HE CAN TELL THE TIME

19:20.990 --> 19:22.912
AT TWO PLACES
IN THE WORLD SIMULTANEOUSLY.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.679
- GUS LIKES TO KNOW THE TIME
IN SANTA BARBARA AND PASADENA.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.891
ONLY NEEDS ONE WATCH.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.750
- YOU, LASSITER.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.529
YOU'RE RUNNING POINT ON THIS.
- WHAT?

19:31.570 --> 19:33.390
- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

19:33.440 --> 19:34.691
THAT THE GUY WITH NO LIFE
WILL GET THE JOB DONE.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.436
NOT TO MENTION,
YOU KNOW THE LANDSCAPE.

19:37.470 --> 19:39.563
- DO I EVER.
O'HARA.

19:42.310 --> 19:43.743
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
DRIGGS BEAT ME

19:43.780 --> 19:45.509
IN THE FIRST ROUND
OF "FIND THAT SPY."

19:45.550 --> 19:46.676
- SHAWN,
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.371
NADIA IS GONNA
FIND US AND KILL US.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.342
- GUS, DON'T BE
A FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS COVER

19:50.390 --> 19:51.345
OF SUSPICIOUS MINDS.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.483
WE'RE GONNA FIND HER.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.408
BUT WE DO NEED A PLAN.
- OH, I HAVE A PLAN.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.916
I'M GONNA PACK ME
A MEDIUM-SIZED SUITCASE

19:56.960 --> 19:59.656
AND MOVE TO MEXICO.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.248
- YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD KNOW

20:01.300 --> 20:03.825
THAT A FILE THIS SECURE
CAN ONLY BE OPENED

20:03.870 --> 20:05.929
ON A LEVEL THREE COMPUTER
IN A GOVERNMENT BUILDING.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.369
- I GOT IT.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.958
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.503
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE THE
CLOSEST GOVERNMENT BUILDING IS

20:11.540 --> 20:14.907
WITH A LEVEL THREE COMPUTER?

20:44.470 --> 20:46.665
- DON'T FORGET IT NEXT TIME.

20:46.710 --> 20:49.235
- [softly grunts]

20:59.750 --> 21:01.456
- [grunts]

21:10.630 --> 21:12.393
- YES!

21:12.430 --> 21:13.897
YES, I AM SENSING
SHE IS HERE.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.532
SHE'S HERE
IN THIS BUILDING.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.731
- LET'S SPLIT UP AND COVER
ALL HIGH SECURITY FLOORS.

21:17.770 --> 21:19.465
- WAIT, CAN WE JUST WALK
INTO A GOVERNMENT BUILDING

21:19.510 --> 21:20.977
LIKE THIS
WITHOUT CLEARANCE?

21:21.010 --> 21:22.568
- YOU CAN
IF YOU'RE WITH ME.

21:22.610 --> 21:23.804
WE'RE
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.703
- WELL, CAN I
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.069
DOES IT HAVE
A PRESIDENTIAL SEAL ON IT?

21:26.110 --> 21:28.317
- LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE!
- GO, GO, GO!

21:28.350 --> 21:30.944
GO, GO!
- SOMEHOW I THINK SHE'LL

21:30.990 --> 21:33.413
BE FOUND SOMEWHERE
A LITTLE LESS OBVIOUS.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.399
- COMPUTER PROBLEMS?
[chuckles]

21:58.450 --> 21:59.644
I HATE IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.011
WHERE'S AN EASY BUTTON
WHEN YOU NEED ONE?

22:01.050 --> 22:02.540
- OH, SHAWN,
YOU DO HAVE A SKILL SET.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.411
DO YOU HAVE ANY
OTHER TALENTS?

22:04.450 --> 22:05.781
- YOU USED US,
YOU LIED TO US.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.481
- AND YOU KILLED STRABINSKY.
- OH, COME ON.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.579
I DIDN'T KILL STRABINSKY.
MAYBE NO ONE DID.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.529
PLUS, IF I
HAD THESE CERTIFICATES,

22:12.560 --> 22:13.891
WHY AM I STILL HERE?
WHY?

22:13.930 --> 22:16.353
- OKAY, FINE.
SO IF YOU REALLY WERE SET UP,

22:16.400 --> 22:17.298
LET US HELP YOU.

22:17.330 --> 22:18.888
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.363
THEY MADE ME
TAKE THE CERTIFICATES.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.369
- WHO?
WHO WAS IT?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.832
- IF I KNEW WHO IT WAS,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

22:24.870 --> 22:27.430
HE WAS IN DISGUISE.
BUT IT'S SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.970
I DON'T KNOW WHO,
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME

22:29.010 --> 22:30.443
TO GIVE YOU
SPY 101 LESSONS RIGHT NOW.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.674
- OH, REALLY? BECAUSE GUS

22:31.710 --> 22:33.109
RECENTLY SAW
HALF OF SPIES LIKE US.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.139
- DOCTOR.
- DOCTOR.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.647
- DOCTOR.
- DOCTOR.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.012
[both giggle]
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.549
- UH, SHE HAS CHOICES,
AND SHE JUST MADE ONE.

22:45.590 --> 22:47.421
- I'M ABOUT
TO MAKE ONE TOO.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.791
I CAN
EITHER DIAL UP DRIGGS,

22:48.830 --> 22:50.491
OR YOU CAN TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED IN BOLIVIA

22:50.530 --> 22:52.566
DURING OPERATION MITLU.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.431
BY THE WAY, WHO GETS
TO NAME THOSE OPERATIONS?

22:54.470 --> 22:56.062
'CAUSE THAT SEEMS FUN.
- HAND ME THE PHONE

22:56.100 --> 22:57.738
BEFORE I HAVE
TO RESORT TO HURTING YOU.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.829
- YEAH, RIGHT.
WITHOUT TOUCHING ME, HMM?

22:59.870 --> 23:01.508
- [chuckles]
NO.

23:01.540 --> 23:02.905
I AM GOING TO TOUCH YOU.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.943
- FAN OUT, PEOPLE.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.987
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.112
[explosion, screams]

23:30.540 --> 23:31.802
- OKAY, PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.637
NO ONE IS TO
LEAVE THIS BUILDING.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.477
I'LL BE
QUESTIONING EACH OF YOU.

23:35.510 --> 23:37.603
SEPARATELY.
ONE AT A TIME.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.504
THIS IS GONNA TAKE A WHILE
SO I HOPE YOU PACKED A SNACK.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.711
- I'LL HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.889
I WANT THIS UNIT SENT
TO HEADQUARTERS TO BE WASHED.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.649
SHE WAS DEFINITELY
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING,

23:45.690 --> 23:47.681
THERE'S JUST
NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.483
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.021
I'M PROBABLY GONNA NEED
SOME SORT OF CLEARANCE LEVEL.

23:51.060 --> 23:51.981
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THE HIGHEST,

23:52.030 --> 23:53.657
JUST ENOUGH TO
GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE BADGES

23:53.700 --> 23:54.598
THAT BEEPS
WHEN YOU SCAN IT.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.655
- DETECTIVE, I'M
NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCLOSE

23:56.700 --> 23:59.794
ANY INFORMATION REGARDING
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.639
PERHAPS IF YOU
WANNA GO BACK IN TIME,

24:01.670 --> 24:03.467
MAKE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
LIFE DECISIONS,

24:03.510 --> 24:05.603
JOIN THE ACADEMY, TRAIN
WITH SOME REAL INVESTIGATORS,

24:05.640 --> 24:09.178
THEN WE CAN TALK.
BUT UNTIL THEN...

24:09.210 --> 24:11.644
- NADIA SAID SHE WAS SET UP
BY SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.978
YOU GET THE FEELING THAT DRIGGS
IS HIDING MORE THAN HE HAS TO?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.544
- NO, NO, NO, SHAWN.
DON'T DO THIS.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.070
NADIA
IS CRAZY AND DANGEROUS.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.610
DRIGGS MAY BE
AN UNPLEASANT MAN,

24:18.650 --> 24:19.912
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM THE BAD GUY.

24:19.950 --> 24:21.508
- I DON'T TRUST HIM.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.652
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:22.690 --> 24:23.850
WHATEVER'S ON THIS FILE
HAS THE SECRET

24:23.890 --> 24:25.027
TO WHAT HAPPENED IN BOLIVIA

24:25.060 --> 24:26.823
AND WILL PROVE
THAT DRIGGS IS BEHIND IT.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.498
- THAT THING
IS HALF-MELTED, SHAWN.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.157
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN RETRIEVE
ANY INFORMATION OFF OF IT.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.667
- YEAH, BUT STRABINSKY CAN.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.224
- OH, COME ON,
I DIDN'T KILL STRABINSKY.

24:33.270 --> 24:34.692
MAYBE NO ONE DID.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.638
- SORRY ABOUT
THE HEAT IN HERE,

24:35.670 --> 24:38.138
BUT THE SUPER HYDRA DRIVES
ARE LIKE OVENS.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.637
SUCK UP POWER
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

24:39.670 --> 24:41.900
- OH, MY GOSH.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.704
- YEAH, THE SANTA BARBARA
POWER GRID WOULD SHOW HOT SPOTS

24:44.750 --> 24:47.173
FOR AREAS THAT ARE USING
CRAZY AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.518
- LIKE HOSPITALS
OR POWER PLANTS.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.518
- AND GIANT MANSIONS
LIKE MINE.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.711
- I HEAR THAT.
SEE, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED, SHAWN.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.116
OUR VERY OWN COMPUTER GUY
FOR THE OFFICE, NICE.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.618
- OH, THAT'S NOT A COMPUTER GUY,
HE'S MY PASTRY CHEF.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.855
THAT'S MY SNACK.
THANK YOU, CHUY.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.754
- CREME BRULEE, GUYS?
both: YES.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.866
- OH.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.959
WHAT'S THAT ONE?
THE WHITE ONE.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.059
RIGHT THERE.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.600
- WHITE MEANS HOT.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.575
HUH, A SMALL
APARTMENT BUILDING.

25:15.610 --> 25:18.670
YEAH, UNLESS THIS PERSON HAS
85 MICROWAVES IN HIS KITCHEN,

25:18.710 --> 25:20.075
THAT'S GOTTA BE STRABINSKY.

25:20.110 --> 25:21.577
- DECLAN, I MUST SAY
YOU'VE ONCE AGAIN

25:21.620 --> 25:22.939
DELIVERED IN THE CLUTCH.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.538
I ALSO HAVE TO ASK YOU
ONE MORE TEENY, WEENY FAVOR.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.046
- I BELIEVE
I'M FRESH OUT OF FAVORS.

25:26.090 --> 25:28.684
- PLEASE, PLEASE,
WAIT 30 MINUTES

25:28.720 --> 25:31.188
BEFORE YOU CALL JULIET
AND TELL HER WE WERE HERE.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.560
[knocking]

25:46.610 --> 25:48.601
[whispers]
KNOCK, KNOCK.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.744
- WHO'S THERE?

25:50.780 --> 25:56.116
- SHAWN.
- AND GUS.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.118
- MAN.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:58.150 --> 26:00.653
AGAIN?
HOW DID YOU GUYS FIND ME?

26:00.690 --> 26:02.885
YOU KNOW WHAT, NORMALLY,
I'D BE HOT UNDER THE COLLAR.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.684
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,

26:05.730 --> 26:07.721
I'M A SUCKER FOR
A COUPLE OF FAMILIAR FACES.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.829
GO ON, GET IN HERE.
COME ON.

26:08.860 --> 26:09.952
- THAN KS, MAN.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.719
OH, LOOK, IT'S VERY EARTHY.
- HUH.

26:12.770 --> 26:15.261
- IT'S CREAMY.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.700
- HEY, I HATE TO ASK
THIS OF GUESTS, YOU KNOW.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.628
BUT COULD YOU GUYS
DO ME A HUGE FAVOR?

26:19.670 --> 26:21.206
- I THINK SO, PROBABLY.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.878
- COULD YOU
TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF?

26:22.910 --> 26:24.172
IT'S A NEW PLACE.
- OH.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.678
[scoffs]
- BERBER CARPETS.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.349
THEY SAY IT'S STAIN-RESISTANT,
BUT I DON'T TRUST THEM.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.779
I DON'T TRUST THEM AT ALL.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.640
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
IN THE NEXT TEN SECONDS,

26:32.690 --> 26:33.782
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHY YOU'RE HERE

26:33.820 --> 26:35.117
OR ELSE I'M GONNA
SET YOU BOTH ON FIRE

26:35.160 --> 26:36.616
WITHOUT
EVEN STRIKING A MATCH.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.854
- WHOA, STRABS.
EASY, BUDDY.

26:37.890 --> 26:41.621
- HEY...I JUST
MOVED IN HERE, COME ON.

26:41.660 --> 26:45.369
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT A LAUNDRY.
THEY'VE GOT AN AWESOME POOL.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.890
LOOK AT THAT.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.659
HUH?

26:48.700 --> 26:51.260
WELL, IT'S NOT AWESOME.
BUT IT'S CIRCULAR.

26:51.310 --> 26:55.007
YOU CAN'T EVEN SWIM LAPS IN IT,
BUT IT'S A POOL.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.645
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

26:57.680 --> 26:59.079
TO FIND
A BODY DECOY THAT WORKS?

26:59.110 --> 27:01.670
THIS ONE'S TOO FAT,
THIS ONE'S TOO SKINNY.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.369
THIS GUY'S JUST RIGHT,
BUT HE'S AN ESKIMO.

27:03.420 --> 27:07.015
- STRABINSKY, IF YOU
HELP US THIS ONE LAST TIME,

27:07.050 --> 27:09.757
YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT WE
WILL NOT FIND YOU A THIRD TIME.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.655
- UNLESS WE NEED
YOUR EXPERTISE A THIRD TIME.

27:11.690 --> 27:14.397
OR WE WANNA
GO SWIMMING IN CIRCLES.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.819
- [sighs]

27:16.860 --> 27:19.067
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

27:19.100 --> 27:22.661
- NADIA WAS TRYING TO DOWNLOAD
SOMETHING ON THIS THING.

27:24.440 --> 27:28.729
- AH, IT LOOKS LIKE
A STILL PHOTO FROM AN EMBASSY.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.748
IT'S A SURVEILLANCE PICTURE.

27:30.780 --> 27:34.409
AT THE EMBASSY IN BOLIVIA.

27:34.450 --> 27:37.169
THAT MUST BE THE SUITCASE
WITH THE CERTIFICATES.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.142
- SO SHE DID TAKE IT.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.441
- HOW DID I
FALL FOR THIS AGAIN?

27:40.490 --> 27:41.912
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE A PLAN.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.179
- I CAN SEE HER
RUNNING FROM A BUILDING.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.720
IT'S A GOVERNMENT BUILDING.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.921
THERE IS A RED,
YELLOW, AND GREEN FLAG.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.690
THE FLAG
IS ON FIRE, THOUGH.

27:51.730 --> 27:54.733
SOMETHING WENT...
[Imitates explosron]

27:54.770 --> 27:56.829
THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.963
THAT'S THE BOLIVIAN EMBASSY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.808
- SHE HAS A SUITCASE.
- WHAT'S IN THE SUITCASE?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.240
- GIVE ME A SECOND,
LET ME TRY TO X-RAY THROUGH IT.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.805
I'M SENSING, I'M GETTING,
I'M SEEING...

28:06.850 --> 28:09.739
CERTIFICATES OF SOME KIND.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.384
CRATE AND BARREL.
NO.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.287
BED, BATH, AND BEYOND?
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY.

28:14.320 --> 28:19.257
GLOBAL CURRENT AFFAIRS...
SOMETHING.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.827
- GCCS,
GLOBAL CURRENCY CERTIFICATES.

28:21.860 --> 28:25.398
WHERE DO YOU SEE THEM?
- I SEE THEM IN MY MIND, TOM.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.933
I'M A PSYCHIC, YOU SEE.

28:27.970 --> 28:30.131
A PSYCHIC SPY.
MAYBE THE ONLY ONE.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.501
PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.007
DEFINITELY
THE ONLY NON-RUSSIAN ONE.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.372
UNLESS YOU COUNT
MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.298
[phone vibrates]

28:37.340 --> 28:39.376
- YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A PHONE CALL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS?

28:39.410 --> 28:41.071
- LIFE DOESN'T STOP
FOR THE PSYCHIC WORLD.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.473
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GET ANY ERRANDS DONE,

28:42.520 --> 28:44.181
OR KNOCK KINKY BOOTS
AT NIGHTTIME?

28:44.220 --> 28:45.448
- JUST GET IT GOING,
WOULD YOU?

28:45.490 --> 28:46.286
[whispers]
STOP MILKING IT.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.459
- I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE UP TO, SHAWN.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.379
- WILL--WILL YOU ALL
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT?

28:52.430 --> 28:54.853
- COULD SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

28:56.560 --> 28:57.527
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:57.560 --> 28:59.369
- YOU'RE POKING AROUND
WHERE YOU DON'T BELONG.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.834
YOU HAVE ALL YOUR FACTS WRONG.
- OKAY, LISTEN.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.531
I SAW THE PICTURE
OF YOU IN BOLIVIA.

29:03.570 --> 29:05.231
YOU LIED TO ME AGAIN.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.238
YOU'RE MAKING ME QUESTION
MY OWN JUDGMENT HERE.

29:07.270 --> 29:09.033
AN HOUR AGO,
I ACCUSED GUS OF TRYING

29:09.080 --> 29:10.968
TO ROPE ME
INTO A PYRAMID SCHEME.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.500
- A LITTLE CRY?
YOU NEED A SHOULDER TO CRY ON,

29:12.550 --> 29:14.438
GO BUY A GOLDFISH.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.913
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S MINE.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.111
I WANT IT BACK.
[clicking]

29:18.150 --> 29:19.378
- OKAY, LOOK,
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

29:19.420 --> 29:21.479
I WILL GIVE
YOU THE PICTURE, OKAY?

29:21.520 --> 29:23.784
[clicking continues, tapping]

29:23.830 --> 29:27.994
YOU HAVE TO AGREE
TO MEET ME NOW.

29:28.030 --> 29:29.327
CAN I REACH YOU
ON THIS PHONE?

29:29.360 --> 29:31.567
- MAYBE ANOTHER TEN SECONDS?
I FIND YOU.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.090
- NO, HOLD--
LOOK, GUS AND I ARE BUSY.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.495
I'M NOT SURE
WHERE WE'LL BE LATER.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.496
MAYBE, UH--MAYBE
WE SHOULD FIND YOU.

29:36.540 --> 29:37.632
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.433
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LOCATION
WHERE YOU CAN MEET ME.

29:39.470 --> 29:41.301
DON'T CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.
- WHY?

29:41.340 --> 29:43.900
DO YOU LIKEN'Ig-IIS OUTFIT?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.474
SO I CAN SPOT YOU
IN A CROWD.

29:45.510 --> 29:47.819
[clicking]

29:50.380 --> 29:53.884
[clicking]

29:58.590 --> 30:01.923
- [sighs]

30:05.530 --> 30:06.827
- WHO WERE
YOU JUST TALKING TO?

30:06.870 --> 30:08.360
- NADIA. SHE WAS
IN THE POLICE STATION.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.437
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- SO RISKY, SO SEXY!

30:11.470 --> 30:13.006
SHE'S REALLY
STARTING TO LIKE ME.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.473
- SHE WANTS TO KILL YOU, SHAWN.
- OH, REALLY?

30:14.510 --> 30:15.909
THEN WHY DID SHE
JUST MAKE A DATE WITH ME

30:15.940 --> 30:17.498
FOR TONIGHT?
- A DATE TO KILL YOU.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.007
YOU NEED TO GO
BACK UP IN THE ROOM

30:19.050 --> 30:20.574
AND TELL THE FEDS
EVERYTHING SHE JUST SAID.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.419
- NO, GUS, THIS IS
OUR CHANCE TO BOURNE IT UP.

30:22.450 --> 30:23.849
I'M MATT DAMON,

30:23.890 --> 30:25.915
YOU'RE ADEWALE
AKINNUOYE-AG. . . BAJ NAN.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.315
- THAT'S NOT
HOW YOU SAY HIS NAME.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.011
- THAT'S WHO YOU ARE, THOUGH.
- OH, NO, I'M NOT.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.880
I'M NOT GONNA BE THAT.
- IT'S TOO LATE TO RECAST.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.922
THE PART IS YOURS.
LET'S GO TAKE DOWN A SPY.

30:45.140 --> 30:48.906
- [whispers]
SHAWN.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.874
SHAWN.
- NADIA.

30:50.910 --> 30:52.468
MY CODE NAME
IS DABNEY WILHELM.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.319
PLEASE CALL ME THAT.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.272
- I WILL NOT.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.571
- WHY?

30:57.620 --> 31:01.158
- BECAUSE I KNOW
YOUR NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

31:01.190 --> 31:04.387
I KNOW YOU.
CODE NAMES ARE FOR ANONYMITY.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.558
WHAT IT THIS?
- IT'S A NEWSPAPER.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.399
- YES, BUT
WHY DO YOU HAVE IT?

31:09.430 --> 31:11.364
- IT'S A SPY THING.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.561
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M SITTING HERE
READING ADS ABOUT PUPPIES,

31:13.600 --> 31:15.898
BUT REALLY...
I'M SCOPING THE PERIMETER.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.363
- IT'S TOTALLY IDIOTIC.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.299
IT'S NIGHTTIME.
IT'S IDIOTIC.

31:21.340 --> 31:23.535
LIKE THIS SILLY COAT
YOU'RE WEARING.

31:23.580 --> 31:25.400
- YOU ARE SO HARSH.

31:25.450 --> 31:28.271
[stage whisper]
GUS, LOSE THE PAPER.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.517
- WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOING IN THERE?

31:33.550 --> 31:36.018
- UNFORTUNATELY,
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.153
- SERIOUSLY, HOW LONG ARE
WE GONNA LET THIS GO ON FOR?

31:38.190 --> 31:40.078
- JUST RELAX, I WANNA
SEE IF SHE'LL HANG HERSELF.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.427
WE MIGHT GET A CONFESSION.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.654
- SIR, WE DON'T NEED
A CONFESSION.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.021
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH
ON HER GOING AWOL.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.628
WITH THE BREAK-IN,
WE CAN NAIL HER RIGHT NOW.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.592
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S CUT
TO THE CHASE, SHALL WE?

31:48.640 --> 31:50.938
- I WANT YOU
TO TRUST ME, SHAWN.

31:50.970 --> 31:52.665
BECAUSE
WE HAVE A CONNECTION.

31:52.710 --> 31:55.577
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT SPENCER
THAT PEOPLE SEE THAT I DON'T?

31:55.610 --> 31:59.569
- SHE'S CONNING HIM.

31:59.610 --> 32:01.646
- LET'S CUT
TO THE REAL CHASE.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.989
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.079
FROM THE MOMENT
WE LEAPT FROM THAT PIER,

32:06.120 --> 32:07.610
WE HAD SOMETHING.

32:07.650 --> 32:10.517
TELL ME YOU BELIEVE
THAT I'M INNOCENT,

32:10.560 --> 32:14.451
AND MAYBE WE COULD SPEND
SOME TIME OFF THE GRID.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.252
A GUY WITH YOUR ABILITIES
AND A GIRL LIKE ME,

32:16.300 --> 32:18.063
WE COULD DO SOME DAMAGE.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.260
YEAH.

32:19.300 --> 32:22.133
COME ON, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SHY WITH ME.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.365
- STOP IT, STOP IT.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.298
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
WITH ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.638
I DON'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.329
- PREPARE TO MOBILIZE.
WE'RE GOING IN.

32:30.380 --> 32:31.677
REPEAT,
WE'RE ABOUT TO MOVE IN.

32:31.710 --> 32:34.213
- SO WHAT IF I DID THIS?

32:34.250 --> 32:36.616
- I CAN'T.
I'M SORRY.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.312
I'M SORRY, NADIA.
I CAN'T.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.250
IT'S JUST, I'D LIKE
TO BE THE SWISS TO YOUR HAM

32:41.290 --> 32:43.554
IN ONE OF THOSE CROISSANTS
AT AU BON PAIN,

32:43.590 --> 32:44.750
BUT THAT JUST
WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO YOU.

32:44.790 --> 32:46.223
- WHY IS THAT?

32:46.260 --> 32:48.148
- BECAUSE I TRUST
THE CROISSANT MORE THAN YOU.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.521
- FINE.
WHY DID YOU EVEN COME HERE?

32:50.560 --> 32:53.358
TO HEAR ME SAY THAT
I KILLED THOSE TWO BOLIVIANS

32:53.400 --> 32:54.662
THAT STOLE THE CERTIFICATES?

32:54.700 --> 32:56.736
THAT I USED MY SKILLS
TO STEAL ENOUGH MONEY

32:56.770 --> 32:58.704
TO LIVE OUT MY DAYS
AT THE AMALFI COAST?

32:58.740 --> 33:00.605
- WHAT IS IT WITH EVERYONE
AND THE AMALFI COAST?

33:00.640 --> 33:01.538
- MOBILIZE ALL TACTILE UNITS.

33:01.580 --> 33:05.300
GET IN THERE AND
TAKE THE SUBJECT DOWN NOW.

33:05.350 --> 33:08.342
- STAY WITH THE VAN.
- WHAT?

33:12.750 --> 33:14.183
-AH!

33:18.630 --> 33:21.019
- GOOD JOB, MEN.

33:21.060 --> 33:23.699
AGENT FONG,
TAKE HER THROUGH PROCESSING.

33:23.730 --> 33:26.699
- I'M SORRY, NADIA.

33:26.730 --> 33:28.766
I LOVE MY COUNTRY TOO MUCH.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.530
MY COUNTRY IS AMERICA.

33:31.570 --> 33:33.663
- I TOLD YOU THAT NEWSPAPER
THING WAS A DUMB IDEA.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.268
- ARE YOU AT ALL SERIOUS?

33:35.310 --> 33:37.175
WE JUST CAPTURED
A DANGEROUS INTERNATIONAL SPY.

33:37.210 --> 33:38.677
YOU'RE HUNG UP
ON THE NEWSPAPER BIT?

33:38.710 --> 33:40.302
- NO, I'M HUNG UP ON
THE FACT THAT

33:40.350 --> 33:42.147
YOU'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH
THIS WOMAN THIS WHOLE TIME,

33:42.180 --> 33:43.545
SHE MAKES
THE ULTIMATE MOVE ON YOU,

33:43.580 --> 33:44.740
AND YOU SHUT HER DOWN--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

33:44.790 --> 33:46.143
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
ARE YOU CRAZY?

33:46.190 --> 33:48.488
- I KNOW,
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.523
MAYBE I AM CRAZY.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.654
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS
THAT JUST NOW, IN THAT MOMENT,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.622
ALL I COULD
THINK ABOUT WAS JULES.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.326
[sighs]
I JUST CAN'T WRAP MYSELF

34:00.370 --> 34:01.837
AROUND THE FACT
THAT SHE'S DATING DECLAN.

34:01.870 --> 34:05.067
IT'S ACTUALLY...
IT'S ACTUALLY KILLING ME.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.805
- SHAWN, THAT IS NOT FAIR.
- I KNOW.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.638
I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.568
IF SHE LIKES THIS GUY,
WHO AM I TO STAND IN THE WAY?

34:11.610 --> 34:13.407
- EXACTLY.

34:13.450 --> 34:14.678
- YOU THINK I DON'T
WANT HER TO BE HAPPY?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.278
I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.538
BUT...

34:18.590 --> 34:21.150
SERIOUS SHAWN MOMENT HERE.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.657
I WANNA BE HAPPY TOO.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.248
AND FOR SOME REASON,
I CAN'T IMAGINE

34:24.290 --> 34:26.326
THAT HAPPENING
WITHOUT JULIET.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.363
HOW CRAZY IS THAT?

34:32.400 --> 34:34.459
- ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN?

34:34.500 --> 34:36.730
- EH.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.762
- WHAT?
I WAS GONNA SAY FOUR.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.611
- NOW I KNOW YOU ALL
WERE WONDERING...

34:49.650 --> 34:51.481
WAS IT DANGEROUS
OUT THERE?

34:51.520 --> 34:54.353
[chuckles]
IT WAS A LITTLE TOUCH AND GO.

34:54.390 --> 34:55.687
- MOSTLY GO.
- WITH PLENTY OF TOUCH.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.880
- MM-HMM.
- AND TO QUOTE

34:56.920 --> 34:59.229
AN UNLIKELY SOURCE,

34:59.260 --> 35:02.388

35:08.700 --> 35:10.839

35:10.870 --> 35:13.430
[phone rings]

35:13.470 --> 35:15.404
- WHOA, WHOA, HOLD UP.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.449
THIS IS NADIA'S PHONE.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.243
SHE MUST'VE SLIPPED IT
IN MY POCKET

35:21.280 --> 35:22.872
WHILE SHE WAS FEELING ME
UP AT THE PARK.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.785
SOMETHING'S DOWNLOADING.

35:28.490 --> 35:31.425
OH, MY GOD.
SHE WAS SET UP.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.688
- HOW COME
THE GUY WITH THE GUN

35:32.730 --> 35:33.685
DIDN'T SHOW UP IN
THE SECURITY CAMERA PHOTOS

35:33.730 --> 35:35.618
WE SAW AT STRABINSKY'S?
- 'CAUSE IT WASN'T TAKEN

35:35.660 --> 35:37.696
WITH THAT CAMERA, GUS.
IT WAS TAKEN FROM THE SKY.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.721
LIKE FROM AN AIRPLANE,
OR A HOT AIR BALLOON.

35:39.770 --> 35:40.919
- OR A SATELLITE?

35:40.970 --> 35:43.165
- DON'T MAKE UP CRAP
FROM THE FUTURE.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.235
- HE'S RIGHT.

35:44.270 --> 35:45.737
THESE ARE THE KIND OF
PHOTOGRAPHS USUALLY TAKEN

35:47.470 --> 35:49.370
- THAT'S WHY SHE HAD TO BREAK
INTO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE.

35:49.410 --> 35:50.809
SHE NEEDED
A LEVEL THREE COMPUTER

35:50.840 --> 35:52.444
SO SHE COULD ACCESS
THE SATELLITE PHOTOS.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.869
- IT'S THE ONLY PHOTO
THAT COULD VINDICATE HER.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.911
- WHO'S THIS?
THE GUY WITH THE GUN.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.679
- TWO WATCHES?

36:03.720 --> 36:05.881
- AGENT TOM FONG.

36:05.930 --> 36:09.195
PATCH ME THROUGH
TO AIR STRIKE COMMAND.

36:09.230 --> 36:12.393
- CRAP.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.660
IT'S TOM FONG.

36:23.410 --> 36:25.674
- LASSITER,
THIS THING ISN'T OVER.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.746
ASSEMBLE THE TEAM,
GET AHOLD OF DRIGGS.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.543
WE HAVE TO FIND FONG.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.787
DRIGGS HAS TO HAVE
A WAY OF TRACKING HIM.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.750
- [groaning]

36:38.790 --> 36:41.350
[Spits]

36:41.400 --> 36:44.426
- EH, YOU GOT AWAY
FROM ME IN BOLIVIA, NADIA.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.426
BUT THAT'S OVER.

36:46.470 --> 36:47.789
NOW TELL ME WHERE
YOU HID THE CERTIFICATES.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.731
- I'LL TELL YOU.

36:50.770 --> 36:51.998
WAIT.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.860
NO, I WON'T!

36:53.910 --> 36:57.732
[loud Slap]

36:57.780 --> 37:00.248
- I GUESS
IT'S GONNA GET UGLY THEN.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.738
[crackles]

37:03.780 --> 37:05.816
- FREEZE!
DROP THE WEAPON, TOM!

37:05.850 --> 37:08.853
- FREEZE, TOM!

37:08.890 --> 37:10.983
- HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.988
- I FOUND STRABINSKY
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.793
YOU'RE ASKING ME
HOW I TRACKED YOU DOWN,

37:14.830 --> 37:17.822
JACK. ..FONG?

37:17.860 --> 37:20.260
- YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO THE SUIT, TOM.

37:20.300 --> 37:23.963
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.638
- OH.
OH, NADIA.

37:25.670 --> 37:27.763
YOU WANTED TO GET
CAUGHT IN THAT PARK.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.698
YOU KNEW YOU WOULD,
YOU NEEDED TO.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.037
YOU KNEW
YOU'D BEEN BETRAYED,

37:31.080 --> 37:32.638
BUT WITHOUT
KNOWING WHO THE BAD GUY WAS,

37:32.680 --> 37:34.819
WHO COULP/IEYOU TRUST?

37:34.850 --> 37:36.579
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
I WOULD FIGURE IT OUT

37:36.620 --> 37:38.679
AND LEAD EVERYONE HERE
TO SEE IT WITH THEIR OWN EYES.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.449
AND YOU DIG ME.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.957
AND YOU LOOK
ALMOST AS GOOD UPSIDE DOWN

37:41.990 --> 37:43.389
AS YOU DO RIGHT SIDE UP.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.581
AND THAT CAN ONLY
BE SAID ABOUT YOU, ME,

37:45.630 --> 37:47.052
AND MAYBE JAVIER BARDEM.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.695
- NO, NOT JAVIER BARDEM.
- NO, YOU DON'T THINK SO?

37:49.730 --> 37:52.494
- JON STEWART.
- JON STEWART, REALLY?

37:52.530 --> 37:54.862
I WOULDN'T--
- WE DIDN'T FIND FONG.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.663
DRIGGS DID.
- IT'S ALL SEMANTICS, GUS.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.634
- IT'S NOT SEMANTICS AT ALL.

37:58.670 --> 38:00.604
- NOTE TO SELF,
LOOK UP THE WORD "SEMANTICS."

38:00.640 --> 38:03.734
- UH, GUYS, EXCUSE ME.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.668
- OH, RIGHT.
- OH, OF COURSE.

38:05.710 --> 38:06.972
- WHAT DO WE, UH--
- OH, WOW.

38:07.010 --> 38:08.409
- OH, THAT LOOKS COMPLICATED.

38:08.450 --> 38:09.576
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID

38:09.620 --> 38:11.645
TO YOUR FEET
TO GET YOU UP THERE?

38:19.890 --> 38:22.029
- HEY, SHAWN, GUS.

38:22.060 --> 38:22.856
I BUZZED YOU UP,
LIKE, HALF AN HOUR AGO.

38:22.900 --> 38:23.719
- WELL, WE WOULD'VE
BEEN HERE SOONER

38:23.760 --> 38:24.658
BUT WE GOT LOST
IN YOUR TOPIARY MAZE.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.895
- WE JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME

38:26.930 --> 38:28.431
FOR SPONSORING OUR CASE.
- ALL RIGHT.

38:28.470 --> 38:29.960
WELL, IT ALL WORKED OUT
SO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE HELPED.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.604
WELL, LISTEN, I WAS IN THE
MIDDLE OF BIDDING ON SOMETHING

38:31.640 --> 38:33.369
WHEN YOU GUYS RANG THE BELL.

38:33.410 --> 38:35.708
IT'S UP TO 30 MILLION,
SO IT'S GETTING SLIGHTLY HEATED.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.037
THEY'RE WAITING FOR ME
UPSTAIRS ON THE PHONE.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.048
- YOU'RE MAKING A PHONE BID
OF $30 MILLION U.S.?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.945
- YEAH, I WISH.
EUROS.

38:43.420 --> 38:44.489
- MAY I?

38:46.050 --> 38:49.759
- [scoffs]

38:49.790 --> 38:51.087
- SHAWN.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.223
- HEY.
- HI.

38:52.260 --> 38:55.559
WHY ARE YOU STANDING IN
DECLAN'S FOYER ALL BY YOURSELF?

38:55.600 --> 38:58.125
- CREEPY?
- SORT OF.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.559
- YEAH.
- SHAWN,

38:59.600 --> 39:03.092
YOU HAVE SOLVED A LOT OF CASES
FOR THE S.B.P.D.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.062
BUT THIS ONE WAS
PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.898
I MEAN, BOLIVIAN EMBASSIES
AND INTERNATIONAL ESPIONAGE.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.805
HOW DID YOU AND GUS DO IT
ALL BY YOURSELF?

39:10.840 --> 39:12.501
- WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA LIE TO YOU, JULES.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.108
IT WAS DIFFICULT.

39:14.150 --> 39:17.642
BUT NOW THAT IT'S OVER, I'M
READY TO PUT "FREELANCE SPY"

39:17.680 --> 39:18.908
ON MY LIST OF SPECIAL SKILLS.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.918
- WELL, HERE'S A MYSTERY
YOU CAN SOLVE FOR ME.

39:20.950 --> 39:23.009
YESTERDAY, I CAME HERE
AI-TER WORK

39:23.060 --> 39:26.427
AND I FOUND THREE CREME BRULEE
DISHES BY DECLAN'S COMPUTER.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.394
ANY IDEA WHO COULD'VE
EATEN ALL OF THOSE?

39:28.430 --> 39:30.125
- MM...

39:30.160 --> 39:32.924
I WOULD SAY THAT DECLAN
HAS AN ENORMOUS SWEET TOOTH.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.767
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE
IGNORED, JULES.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.893
SUGAR IS A GATEWAY DRUG.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.805
- HMM.

39:38.840 --> 39:42.401
WELL, I GUESS THEN
IT WILL REMAIN AN OPEN CASE.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.045
- I GUESS SO.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.139
- WELL, I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO HEAD OUT

39:47.180 --> 39:48.738
AND DO SOME SHOPPING
FOR THE TRIP.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.112
- RIGHT.
THE TRIP, OF COURSE.

39:51.150 --> 39:55.484
UH, HAVE A--YEAH, HAVE
A GREAT FOUR DAYS OFF, JULES.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.489
- IT'S TWO WEEKS, SHAWN.
- WOW, THAT'S LENGTHY.

39:58.530 --> 40:01.158
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.124
THAT'S A REAL AMOUNT
OF VACATION TIME.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.999
HAVE AN AMAZING TRIP.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.962
OKAY?

40:13.010 --> 40:14.978
PROMISE ME.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.069
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
THEY SAY, THAT--

40:17.110 --> 40:20.147
THAT THESE KIND OF TRIPS ARE
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCES.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.171
AND THAT THEY'RE EVEN BETTER
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

40:22.220 --> 40:23.812
YOU CARE ABOUT
TO SHARE THEM WITH.

40:23.850 --> 40:27.081
AND...

40:27.120 --> 40:29.953
YOU DO.

40:29.990 --> 40:32.083
TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.654
NOT OF SIGHTS.

40:33.690 --> 40:37.057
DON'T TAKE
PICTURES OF BUILDINGS.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.965
TAKE PICTURES OF MOMENTS.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.195
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.460
CAPTURE THEM HERE...

40:43.500 --> 40:45.639
AND HOLD ON TO THEM HERE.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.202
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.879
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU MIGHT TAKE BLURRY PHOTOS

40:53.910 --> 40:56.219
OF YOUR ESPRESSO
AT SOME RANDOM CAFE.

41:21.610 --> 41:23.976
- HEY, BUNNY!

41:24.010 --> 41:25.705
BUNNY, HEY!

41:25.750 --> 41:27.877
AW, WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
TO WORRY ANY MORE

41:27.910 --> 41:30.219
ABOUT THAT HOTEL IN AMALFI
BEING ALL BOOKED UP.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.946
- OH, YEAH?
WHY'S THAT?

41:32.990 --> 41:36.778
- BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT IT.
OH, YEAH!

41:41.290 --> 41:43.724
- WELL, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT, MAN.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.125
IF GUS AND I EVER
MAKE IT OUT THAT WAY,

41:45.170 --> 41:47.661
WE'LL LOOK FORWARD
TO STEALING SOME TOWELS.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.191
- I'M GONNA
HAVE THEM MONOGRAMMED.

41:56.140 --> 41:59.143
AMALFI.
