06:02.067 --> 06:03.668
About opening up the night
tonight?

06:03.802 --> 06:07.538
>> one thing i no he for sure
about shelby is she loves

Alabama, like loves alabama.
That was --

06:09.107 --> 06:12.844
[ laughter ]
that was -- i think my favorite

06:12.978 --> 06:19.150
Performance from you so far.
It was -- i mean --

06:19.284 --> 06:21.252
[ applause ]
definitely something you can

06:21.386 --> 06:24.021
Show your range and just take
out, you know, some

06:24.156 --> 06:27.391
Aggressiveness on that
performance and felt it.

06:27.526 --> 06:34.599
So, good job, sis.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.805
Out here like a cannon and you
walked around on the stage and i

06:40.939 --> 06:44.575
Felt like this was definitely
one of your most comfortable

06:44.710 --> 06:47.945
Performances, you know, aside
from your voice just sort of

06:48.080 --> 06:50.681
Raging like a -- i want to say a
lion but i know you want a

06:50.816 --> 06:52.483
Giraffe.
>> like a raging giraffe.

06:52.618 --> 06:56.420
>> yeah.
So anyway, i think you should

06:56.555 --> 06:57.855
Probably get your giraffe food
supplies up.

06:57.990 --> 07:02.226
>> carson: I can't wait to hear
about this giraffe.

07:02.361 --> 07:03.995

07:04.129 --> 07:05.062

>> yeah.
>> that's crazy.

07:07.232 --> 07:09.233
Anyways.
But i think that song for you

07:09.368 --> 07:12.136
Felt like one of your songs.
I could see you doing a song

07:12.271 --> 07:15.540
Like that for sure.
If i could give one bit of

07:15.674 --> 07:18.242
Advice, what i would think, is
the growl, that really amazing

07:18.377 --> 07:21.045
Growl that you do, i would save
that a little bit more, make

07:21.179 --> 07:26.450
That more special, i feel like
you're doing it a lot.

07:26.585 --> 07:27.652
But besides that you know what i
feel about you.

07:27.786 --> 07:29.520
You are like a 17-year-old, like
i don't understand that.

07:29.655 --> 07:33.090

07:48.974 --> 07:51.909
Pull that off.
But you deserve a giraffe.

You're such a pro.
That b-roll stuff was cool to

14:04.683 --> 14:07.584
Hear about the production side
of what you do and what you're

14:07.719 --> 14:11.922
Into because it really comes
through in your performances,

14:12.057 --> 14:15.225
Now that i see that and know
that, there's no wonder why

14:15.360 --> 14:17.294
You're so -- you seem like such
a pro, like you have been doing

14:17.429 --> 14:19.129

So all your performances are

14:19.264 --> 14:21.231

Difference between today's
performance and any other time

Smartest way to use this show.

real deal.

Nice job.
Adam levine, let's start with

29:03.380 --> 29:07.884
You, buddy.
>> um, korin, you know, i think

29:08.018 --> 29:10.987
That one of the hardest things
to do as an artist, especially

29:11.121 --> 29:16.726
When you're younger, is finding
an identity for yourself and

29:16.861 --> 29:19.028
What i'm so proud of you for and
for gwen as well is kind of the

29:19.163 --> 29:21.764
Molding and the shaping of your
identity as a singer and what

29:21.899 --> 29:24.267
You want to accomplish it is
like when you look at yourself

29:24.401 --> 29:27.403
What you're doing in the
beginning compared to now, it's

29:27.538 --> 29:30.373
Like, you're really doing --
making the music you want to do,

29:30.507 --> 29:33.643
Doing it in your own way and
that individuality and that kind

29:33.777 --> 29:39.716
Of your own unique way of doing
it to me is 99% of this and i'm

29:39.850 --> 29:41.885
Just really proud of you.
>> carson: Pharrell?

29:42.019 --> 29:45.521

Our last talk last week, it's
just like watching you and by

29:49.727 --> 29:53.196
The way, i'm only saying it
because i noticed at that time

29:53.330 --> 29:55.965
You were nervous, but tonight,
um, you weren't.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.868
It's like you're -- you're
definitely coming into your own

29:59.003 --> 30:03.506
But more importantly, you
recognize the importance of

30:03.641 --> 30:09.312
Just, like, being yourself and,
like, knowing that this is your

30:09.446 --> 30:11.414
Moment and regardless to what
you're supposed to enjoy

30:11.548 --> 30:13.416
Yourself.
Couldn't you guys feel that just

30:13.550 --> 30:15.785
Now?
[ applause ]

30:15.920 --> 30:18.554
I could really feel it.
I think -- i don't know, i just

30:18.689 --> 30:20.390
Think you're on the right path
now.

30:20.524 --> 30:23.559
You definitely, you know, gwen's
doing an amazing job with you,

30:23.694 --> 30:26.296
But obviously, having your
family there is great, too.

30:26.430 --> 30:30.633
So, it's awesome.

Look at you, you're all sparkly
and beautiful and confident and

30:43.013 --> 30:46.783
You have such a unique sound to
your voice and that song meant

30:46.917 --> 30:52.088
So much to you and to be able to
be here tonight and sing that

30:52.222 --> 30:55.024

rhythmic.

¶

33:07.057 --> 33:08.991

up about the guitar.

play the guitar.

33:10.327 --> 33:13.663

¶ and i knew if i wanted
this thing to last

Sooner or later i'd have
to ask

45:19.956 --> 45:23.992
For your hand ¶
¶ so i took a chance

45:24.127 --> 45:30.232

¶ this is the sound of my soul

57:43.365 --> 57:45.433
¶
>> i wanted to pick a song that

57:45.568 --> 57:48.603
Took him back to where we were
when did he the michael buble

57:48.737 --> 57:51.072
Song.
¶ i bought a ticket to world ¶

57:51.206 --> 57:54.042
>> i want people to forget about
the fact he is 15 years old and

57:54.176 --> 57:56.578
Look at him like he is just an
amazing singer.

57:56.712 --> 57:57.612
>> you help me out with the
melody?

57:57.746 --> 58:00.982
>> yeah.
¶ this is the sound of my soul

58:01.116 --> 58:04.652
¶
>> like the way he does it

58:04.787 --> 58:06.854
Reminds me a lot of your style,
like ¶

58:06.989 --> 58:11.459
¶ sound of my soul ¶
he does all those, oh, you know?

58:11.594 --> 58:14.028
Learn it the closest you can to
the original and then find

58:14.163 --> 58:16.364
Little parts that will just
bring your personality in,

58:16.498 --> 58:19.434
'cause if you get it right,
you're gonna get that vote from

58:19.568 --> 58:21.869
All those girls that are, like,
oh, my god.

58:22.004 --> 58:31.245
>> that will be fun.
Watching gwen interact with

58:31.380 --> 58:33.348
Br
braiden, i can see the maternal

58:33.482 --> 58:38.019
Instinct to seeing him make him
the best musically he can be but

58:38.153 --> 58:39.387
She connects emotionally.
>> all you can do is look really

58:39.521 --> 58:41.422
Cool.
>> that was a horrible spin.

58:41.557 --> 58:43.157
>> you're going to come out and
just sing.

58:43.292 --> 58:45.927
>> l the biggest challenge with
this song is just familiarizing

58:46.061 --> 58:47.495
Myself with it i want to have
another big moment and i don't

58:47.630 --> 58:53.234
Want to go home.
So, i need to really nail this

58:53.369 --> 58:57.372
One.

59:13.122 --> 59:19.727
Funny how it seems
always in time

59:19.862 --> 59:25.433
But never in line for dreams
head over heels ¶

59:25.567 --> 59:29.070

Oh i want the truth
to be said ¶

59:59.868 --> 01:00:10.645

>> thank you.
>> carson: You got it, buddy.

01:01:50.379 --> 01:01:55.516
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for the accompaniment on that

01:01:55.651 --> 01:02:00.521
All right, let's get to it.
>> wow.

01:02:00.656 --> 01:02:03.558
>> b
>> carson: Braidsen is excited,

01:02:03.692 --> 01:02:05.593
Coach is excited, how about you,
blake?

01:02:05.727 --> 01:02:09.063
>> just magic, just odd enough
of a song choice with this guy

01:02:09.198 --> 01:02:12.266
And i tell you what, man, i
don't -- the pairing of you two

01:02:12.401 --> 01:02:15.837
Has been one of my favorite
things to see on this show ever,

01:02:15.971 --> 01:02:19.574
Because it's like -- the way you
meet in the middle and i'm glad

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:22.310
That you probably never heard
that song before and i'm glad

01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:25.980
That you went along with her
because, man, you took it and

01:02:26.114 --> 01:02:28.950
You made it your own.
It worked so well, so different,

01:02:29.084 --> 01:02:30.551
Man.
>> carson: Continue with that,

01:02:30.686 --> 01:02:32.253
Pharrell
>> yeah, congratulations.

01:02:32.387 --> 01:02:34.989
[ applause ]
i mean, listen, man, i know that

01:02:35.123 --> 01:02:38.226
You guys probably want to get
away from the fact that you're

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.097
15 years old, but for me, when
i -- when i hear a guy sound

01:02:43.232 --> 01:02:47.568
Like you and, you know, like
you're 15 years old singing this

01:02:47.703 --> 01:02:50.538
Kind of song, embracing it the
big note in the middle that you

01:02:50.672 --> 01:02:53.708
Held, like, forever, i was
looking at my watch thinking --

01:02:53.842 --> 01:02:56.878
[ applause ]
that big note was crazy.

01:02:57.012 --> 01:03:01.048
And then the other thing i would
like to point out to you,

01:03:01.183 --> 01:03:04.518
Braiden, like i really like the
subtle, like, little small runs

01:03:04.653 --> 01:03:07.221
In there that you do, like it is
just like so much control.

01:03:07.356 --> 01:03:09.891
And again, it just takes me back
to the fact that you're 15 years

01:03:10.025 --> 01:03:14.462
Old.
It's crazy.

01:03:14.596 --> 01:03:17.665
>> carson: Gwen?
>> i have to keep -- i have to

01:03:17.799 --> 01:03:23.938
Keep doing this, like mom thing,
oh, my god, like i'm just blown

01:03:24.072 --> 01:03:28.109
Away by you.
I mean, your tone tonight, those

01:03:28.243 --> 01:03:31.379
Notes, like i'm going to show
them how good i am, watch this.

01:03:31.513 --> 01:03:34.448
And it was so good.
And you were so cute.

01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:38.119
And it was so perfect and i'm --
i'm shocked, like not because i

01:03:38.253 --> 01:03:40.988
Don't know how good you are, but
you did so much of your own

01:03:41.123 --> 01:03:43.624
Stuff to that song that was so
tasteful and so good, i'm so

01:03:43.759 --> 01:03:47.929
Proud of you and i love you and
i love you and i love you and i

01:03:48.063 --> 01:03:49.297
Love you and i love you.

She allowed me to discover my
everything to her for that.

>> been here two minutes and she
is telling stories.

01:04:52.494 --> 01:04:54.495

Right now.
>> well, i got news for you.

01:05:01.303 --> 01:05:04.005
I wrote an original song for my
recital when i was likes 5 and

01:05:04.139 --> 01:05:07.074
It was called "the lizard and
the bluebird," my mom will

01:05:07.209 --> 01:05:09.677
Attest to this, only one that
heard that terrible song.

01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:13.514
So, i'm really pumped.
You have been on this amazing

Trajectory where you are like
inspirational.

01:05:15.717 --> 01:05:21.155
I saw the song and a pop song
but a thread that tells your

01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:23.124
Story.
¶

01:05:23.258 --> 01:05:28.295
I have had issues in life with
self-image and being different

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:30.464
And accepting myself.
¶

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:33.401
The lyrics of this song say be
true to who you are.

01:05:33.535 --> 01:05:36.003
Ample lot going on musically, if
we can scale it back a ton, i

01:05:36.138 --> 01:05:41.675
Want the vocal to be driving.
I wouldn't mind stopping so

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.744
You're doing no band on the
first note.

01:05:43.879 --> 01:05:46.347
¶ no ¶
>> that's the heart of the song

01:05:46.481 --> 01:05:49.050
For me.
People want to tell you what to

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:51.919
Say and what to believe and what
to think and you just have to

01:05:52.054 --> 01:05:54.789
Say no.
This is who i'm gonna be.

01:05:54.923 --> 01:05:56.924
I'm proud of that the song is
going well.

01:05:57.059 --> 01:06:02.229

Jordan, your attention to detail
when you sing is remarkable to
watch because it's so effortless

01:09:50.425 --> 01:09:54.428
When you sing, i mean, that's
what all the yelping is for,
because --

01:09:54.562 --> 01:09:58.299
[ cheering ]
you sing those notes like that,
the people can feel it and they

01:09:58.433 --> 01:10:01.969
Can feel your intention, i feel
like that's one of the most
important things, man.

01:10:02.103 --> 01:10:06.373
Yes, you are a great singer and
yes, you sound great, but
that -- that intention that you

01:10:06.508 --> 01:10:10.344
Put forth, that you share with
the people is huge and it's
generous of you.

01:10:10.478 --> 01:10:14.648
It's awesome.
>> yeah.
>> carson: Well said.

01:10:14.783 --> 01:10:17.885

Gwen?
>> i'm -- it's hard to speak

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:23.324
After that, you know?
I mean, how good does that feel,
to be as good as you are and go

01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:28.095
Up there and use your gift like
that and just shine?
I mean, it's so fun to watch.

01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:33.367
It's so incredible.
And how great is this life to
have this moment right now?

incredible.

I will tell you the rest later.
But in this 15 seconds, let me

01:10:48.249 --> 01:10:52.753
Try to convey to you, you know,
this guy does have an insecurity
and it's about his kind of

01:10:52.887 --> 01:10:57.124
Performance ability, that's what
we always talk about, i can
sing, but, you know, i don't

01:10:57.258 --> 01:10:59.693
Want to just stand there and
sing.
You are one of the best

01:10:59.828 --> 01:11:02.096
Performers that i know
because --
[ cheering ]

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:04.665
Hold on.
Hold on!
Stop.

01:11:04.799 --> 01:11:08.569
I'm running out of time.
You are one of the best
performers i know because you do

01:11:08.703 --> 01:11:15.109
The impossible, which is sing
like you do but also do it with
this conviction that keeps

01:11:15.243 --> 01:11:18.512
Everyone completely in it and
mesmerized and with you every
second of the way.

01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:22.116

01:12:25.513 --> 01:12:31.018
>> stop.
I'm never laughing around you
ever again.

01:12:31.152 --> 01:12:35.289
To me, family is just such an
important thing.
To have my dad actually here.

01:12:35.423 --> 01:12:38.992
>> how you doing, boss man?
>> so much because he is the
biggest influence in the kind of

01:12:39.127 --> 01:12:43.263
Music that i love.
>> so, when did you realize what
you were dealing with here,

01:12:43.398 --> 01:12:49.203
Talent-wise?
>> when she was 4 years old, get
out in the old truck and i kept

01:12:49.337 --> 01:12:55.676
On playing ricky scaggs and she
would just rattle those songs
off sitting in that car seat.

01:12:55.810 --> 01:13:00.681
So it was just a hoot.
¶ well you finally come down to
your old hometown ¶

01:13:00.815 --> 01:13:05.252
>> it is so incredible knowing
that i have the support of
america to be here in the top 11

01:13:05.386 --> 01:13:09.857
Is crazy.
Ricky scaggs, i'm such a huge
fan of his.

01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:15.095
He follows me on social media
and he has been, like, super
cool and supportive.

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.531
>> you want to bluegrass this
up?
>> yeah, we can.

01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:20.734

Can you play a slow roll banjo

>> yep.
>> if we do any drums, just some
percussion stuff maybe.

01:13:24.806 --> 01:13:31.512
If you want to start steering
that way a little bit musically,
i think it's time, you know?

01:13:36.985 --> 01:13:40.888
Song and made it into the style
that would fit the type of music
that i want to make.

01:13:41.022 --> 01:13:43.557
>> that high part of your voice,
that is bluegrass.
>> yeah.

01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:48.962
>> i think it sounds sweet.
>> i'm excited.
>> it's unbelievable how much

01:13:49.097 --> 01:13:53.700
Emily has grown as an artist and
musician working with blake.
She is having so much fun.

01:13:53.835 --> 01:13:58.539
>> i am, too, man.
You don't get one like her very
often.

music, you know, as well as you

01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:06.860
Do obviously, but when you sing

Classic songs because you have,

01:18:18.065 --> 01:18:20.801
When we come back, jeffery
austin closes out the night with
a stripped-down performance of a

01:18:33.748 --> 01:18:36.817
>>> all right.
Welcome back.
One more artist will perform and

01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:40.887
Then all methods will be open

Ending the night, it's team

01:18:41.022 --> 01:18:48.829
Gwen's powerful pop sing here is
putting his stamp on a dance
anthem, jeffrey austin.

01:18:48.963 --> 01:18:54.334
>> team gwen.
I woke up the next morning after
my performance and saw my song

01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:57.838
At number nine on the itunes
charts.
I screamed.

01:18:57.972 --> 01:19:01.842
>> i just have to say, like, the
blind odd digs, how i was the
only one that turned around and

01:19:01.976 --> 01:19:05.478
Now you're, like, a star.
>> i've still got a one-chair
mindset.

01:19:05.613 --> 01:19:11.618
I'm always ready to keep, you
know, proving myself.
>> when he was little, he would

01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:14.054
Stand on the fireplace in his
dad's t-shirts and he would sing
song after song.

01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:18.058
>> wow.
>> yeah.
>> whether it's musically or

01:19:18.192 --> 01:19:22.662
When i first came out, she has
always been so accepting which
is what is so great about moms.

01:19:22.797 --> 01:19:25.699
>> what do you think about the
song?
>> as a gay man, getting to see

01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:30.937
Robin on national television,
dream come true.
>> wow.

01:19:31.072 --> 01:19:35.575

>> i wanted to take a dance pop

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.912
Song and show i could make it my
own.
>> i believe that you're this

01:19:39.046 --> 01:19:43.984
Person when you're singing that
song, but every single time that
you stop singing, you don't know

01:19:44.118 --> 01:19:47.654
What to do with your body.
Do you notice that a little bit,
mo.?

01:19:47.788 --> 01:19:52.459
You're such a natural singer,
why can't your body be the same
way?

01:19:52.593 --> 01:19:56.730
Vocally, his instincts are
masterful.
I think he could easily go off

01:19:56.864 --> 01:20:00.901
And make a really emotional
album.
¶ i'm giving it my all ¶

01:20:01.035 --> 01:20:12.846

I just came to say goodbye ¶

Hearing you sing, jeffery, we
hear a lot of people sing, so,
when that's the case, it's

01:23:31.846 --> 01:23:36.850
Always -- it excites us, you
know, we start to get turned on
to new talent and there's just

01:23:36.984 --> 01:23:44.190
Something about your voice, you
can't teach the unique quality
that you have and that's the

01:23:44.325 --> 01:23:46.426
Kind of quality that can be
heard by millions and millions
of people all over the world,

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:51.631
Country coach that, you have
done an incredible job, but man,

01:24:00.841 --> 01:24:06.546
Had a lot of thought, one of
them was when you were
performing, oh, my gosh,

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.452
Jeffery -- jeffery could win,
co-win "the voice" this season.
And then i was thinking -- you

01:24:12.586 --> 01:24:18.057
Could be the first female coach
to ever win "the voice" also.
[ cheers and applause ]

01:24:18.192 --> 01:24:21.261
A big deal that's happening,
jeffery.
