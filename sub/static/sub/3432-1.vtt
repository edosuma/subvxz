00:26.640 --> 00:28.660
He's just sitting there, man.
You can run around the edge!

00:28.760 --> 00:29.860
- I know, right.
- That's what...

00:29.960 --> 00:31.220
All right, guys.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.740
- It wasn't my fault.
- Yeah.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.841
Hey!

00:35.680 --> 00:37.967
We just set a record.
It's not a good one.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.163
The most points ever scored
against this school, and it's halftime.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.740
You think that's funny, Mitchell?

00:45.840 --> 00:46.860
No, sir.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.122
Well, then why are you laughing?

00:49.720 --> 00:51.300
You're our captain,
elected by these guys.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.420
Our only senior.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.966
The time for you to make an impression
was in practice this week.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.580
On the field tonight. Not now.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.966
And certainly not on the sidelines,

00:59.560 --> 01:00.900
planning a party at your parents' house

01:01.000 --> 01:02.843
because you know
they're gone this weekend.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.561
Pick it up.

01:08.920 --> 01:10.524
Brandon, come here.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.642
Come here. Yeah, you.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.001
I said pick it up.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.523
Now hand it to him.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.980
Now, we have about five minutes
before we have to go out there,

01:35.080 --> 01:37.208
in front of everybody
who's come here to support us tonight.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.420
The question is,
what's gonna happen to you now,

01:39.520 --> 01:40.500
when you have to go out there,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.011
and everybody thinks
that you're gonna lay down.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.241
Bull...!

01:45.600 --> 01:46.580
Get out.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.205
Me? I didn't say anything.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.487
I said get out.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.401
Are you kidding me?

01:57.240 --> 01:58.526
Come here, let me take a look at that.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.805
Dad, please tell me
that you took the wrong exit.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.850
Are we in Mexico?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.406
No.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.566
Shall we go take a look, folks?

04:26.280 --> 04:28.044
Come on.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.568
Is this really the place?

04:50.720 --> 04:51.881
Wow.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.407
Who's she?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.326
Paint store.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.700
First thing tomorrow.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.643
Assuming there is one.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.220
Julie.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.300
What?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.380
Let's go find your room, girls.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.845
Come on.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.485
This place is a dump.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.500
Like you care.
You'll be at college soon.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.648
I'm the one who's gotta live here.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.820
I think we're all tired, guys.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.020
Why don't we go find
something to eat, okay?

05:45.120 --> 05:46.500
Sounds great.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.204
They gotta have a restaurant, right?

06:04.800 --> 06:05.740
Hi.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.980
Hello. How are you?

06:07.080 --> 06:09.606
Good.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.128
We got tacos, tortas, burritos,
tostadas and quesadillas.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.740
You got burgers?

06:16.840 --> 06:21.540
No, we got tacos, tortas, tostadas,
burritos, and quesadillas.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.802
Tacos. We'll take the tacos, thank you.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.325
Okay. What kind of meat do you want?

06:25.480 --> 06:29.280
Asada, al pastor,
chorizo, cabeza, lengua, jamon?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.200
I'll bring you a selection.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.169
You can sit wherever you want.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.445
Here?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.620
I want to watch The Brady Bunch.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.370
Yeah. How about it?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.241
All right, everybody, just stay with me.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.201
- Dad?
- Just...

07:12.680 --> 07:14.300
Come on, man. Don't be scared, mija.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.401
Hey, that's enough.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.607
Hold on.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.361
Dad!

07:44.720 --> 07:45.926
You know what, we're not staying.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.100
First thing Monday morning,
we're out of here.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.780
- Jim.
- No, we're not staying here, all right?

07:50.880 --> 07:53.540
I'm not having you
and the girls stay here.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.660
I'll find something else.

07:54.760 --> 07:55.860
How?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.020
I don't remember there being
a whole lot more options.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.020
We'll move to Bakersfield.
All right? I'll commute.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.600
We cannot afford Bakersfield.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.121
Okay. Look at us.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.300
We're living on a teacher's salary.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.925
If you'd just...

08:09.920 --> 08:12.820
If we had just stayed
somewhere longer, I don't know,

08:12.920 --> 08:16.083
built up some tenure,
then it would be different.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.330
I'm sorry.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.380
Babe, you said it yourself.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.960
This is the only job you could get.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.770
- Yeah.
- Right?

08:34.320 --> 08:37.607
And our girls, they start
that school on Monday.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.128
We just gotta make it work.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.967
We don't have a choice.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.250
Right?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.009
I'm so sorry.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.446
Jamie, hon, you're gonna do it.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.005
Come on, hon.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.740
Please don't make me!

09:04.840 --> 09:06.540
I know. I know it's hard.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.700
Please don't make me!

09:07.800 --> 09:10.485
I know it's hard,
but you gotta do it, okay?

09:12.120 --> 09:14.043
Please, Julie, help me.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.780
Hi.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.087
I'm here to meet with
Principal Camillo. I'm Jim.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.163
Jim, the new life science guy.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.527
And PE coach, and football.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.681
That's right.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.300
Maria Marsol. How was the drive in?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.607
You like living in Bakersfield?

09:36.320 --> 09:39.164
Bakersfield? No. We're...

09:39.680 --> 09:40.761
We're here in McFarland.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.081
Well, look at you.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.331
A little help, please?

09:49.160 --> 09:50.700
Certainly don't want a fire
in this place.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.088
It could cost tens of dollars'
worth of damage, right?

09:54.680 --> 09:56.603
This is your last chance, son.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.924
Make the most of it.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.100
Jim White?

10:05.200 --> 10:07.089
Principal Camillo. How are you?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.420
Decaffeinated. Come on.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.363
I'm supposed to bleed a rock
with the budget,

10:11.520 --> 10:14.460
handle the kids and their petty
vendettas, and quit smoking.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.130
Who am I, Superman?

10:18.520 --> 10:19.601
What happened?

10:20.160 --> 10:23.084
Some kid called his little sister a...

10:23.880 --> 10:25.370
I'm not gonna repeat what he said,

10:26.200 --> 10:28.726
but it explains why she's pregnant.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.929
Sit down. Welcome to McFarland.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.405
You know, I was surprised that a man
like you would want to come here.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.722
But then I read your file.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.971
Up in Saint Paul, you were fired
for verbally abusing your players.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.140
I don't use profanity.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.767
I was just trying to motivate some boys
who didn't know the value of hard work.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.565
And a fight with
the chairman of the school board?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.489
Difference of opinion.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.846
And this latest incident.
You wanna tell me about that?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.562
I lost my temper.
It should never have happened.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.900
What are the chances
of it happening again?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.300
It's not gonna happen again.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.401
Pleased to hear it.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.922
Because you're running
out of options, Mr. White.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.647
Come in, Coach.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.524
Coach White, Coach Jenks.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.060
This is your new
overqualified assistant.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.161
That right?

11:16.760 --> 11:17.921
The name's "White"?

11:18.280 --> 11:19.260
Yep.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.361
Wow.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.370
Berdejo.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.288
Cardenas. Denas?

11:31.120 --> 11:32.451
It's "Cardenas."

11:34.040 --> 11:35.121
Diaz.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.527
Diaz.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.851
Diaz.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.930
It's a popular name
where you guys come from?

11:48.440 --> 11:49.521
We gotta go.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.051
Hold on, class isn't dismissed.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.884
We gotta go, really. It's our mom.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.284
Tell your mother she can wait.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.600
You tell her.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.161
Hey, White.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.485
Is that a popular name
where you come from?

12:11.680 --> 12:13.409
- Mr...
- Puentes.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.800
Victor.

12:17.200 --> 12:21.330
Mr. Puentes, regular PE class.
What do you normally do?

12:22.320 --> 12:23.651
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

12:23.760 --> 12:26.206
Come on, homes.
You really wanna mess this up?

12:26.360 --> 12:28.010
You wanna get this all sweaty?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.005
Real peacock, huh?

12:33.080 --> 12:34.320
All right, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.566
We're gonna...

12:35.720 --> 12:37.529
Let's take a lap, we'll call it a day.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.364
What about you?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.408
I'm not running, jefe.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.608
I'm on the football team.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.364
That's a linebacker's number.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.043
It's not the size of the dog
in the fight, coach.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.844
It's the size of the fight in the dog.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.767
Depends on how big the dog is.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.566
Big dog.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.726
Huddle up! Huddle up!

13:36.400 --> 13:37.970
They aren't really good, are they?

13:38.280 --> 13:39.486
Let's give them a chance, hon.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.820
Maybe Dad will lose it again

13:41.920 --> 13:43.300
and then we'll get
to move somewhere else.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.085
Stop it.
I don't wanna hear another word.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.250
Go, Johnny!

14:01.280 --> 14:02.281
Hut!

14:11.160 --> 14:12.924
Wow.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.820
Nothin'!

14:14.920 --> 14:16.285
Did you see that hit?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.968
All right. Return.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.851
Good job, guys!

14:27.520 --> 14:28.601
Good hit! Good hit!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.684
Nice clean hit.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.443
Johnny. Johnny.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.565
How many fingers am I holding up?

14:37.720 --> 14:38.881
September.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.041
What?

14:40.560 --> 14:42.847
Look, it's Friday, man, okay?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.571
Okay, special teams!

14:45.520 --> 14:46.851
No, no, no, no.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.167
Sit down. No. You're done.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.485
Hey, coach, we only got 10!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.483
We need one more! We need one more!

14:55.800 --> 14:56.961
Sameniego, get in here!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.047
No.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.007
I mean it. Sit down.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.002
Cortez, let's go.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.410
Seriously!

15:40.720 --> 15:42.085
What time is it?

15:42.800 --> 15:43.940
I'm guessing dawn.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.883
- Dad.
- What?

15:46.360 --> 15:48.020
Wring its neck.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.360
Please.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.891
I will.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.443
Welcome to McFarland.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.561
For me?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.160
Thank you.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.124
Well, I see you kept it.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.841
Kept what?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.764
Well, knowing where you live,

16:57.920 --> 17:00.380
and knowing la Señora Soto as I do,

17:00.480 --> 17:01.845
I'm thinking she offered you a chicken.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.442
And since you're in here buying feed
instead of barbeque sauce,

17:07.160 --> 17:08.540
I'm thinking you kept it.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.766
Smart move, hombre.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.099
It shows you got manners.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.361
Thanks, Mr...

17:13.520 --> 17:15.180
Sammy Rosaldo.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.124
Open every day on
Sherwood Avenue since '62.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.641
Jim White.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.740
Cliff Avenue for about a week,

17:22.839 --> 17:24.540
but it sounds
like you already know that.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.290
I know a lot of things about McFarland.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.682
Do you know anything about a plant
that can make my garden look better?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.524
You don't need a plant. You need a tree.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.841
A tree?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.201
Sonia!

17:39.000 --> 17:40.570
The way that lot faces,

17:40.880 --> 17:43.201
the sun's too hot.
Fries up your little verduras.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.086
Lucky for you,
I have a little tree I can sell you.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.730
In 5 years, señor,

17:52.920 --> 17:55.651
you're gonna have a nice yard
with some nice shade.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.160
Five years?

18:01.280 --> 18:02.441
I don't think so.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.420
You know, they got sodas in the store.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.363
Water is free, White.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.010
How long have you guys been at it?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.525
Since five.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.521
Five?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.725
5:00 a.m., White.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.526
"AM" means morning, ese.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.843
Not the radio.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.770
Hey, White. Chop and channel your Jeep,

18:30.960 --> 18:33.247
glass finish it, crank up the bass,

18:33.400 --> 18:36.051
hop up and down... You'll fit right in.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.521
Yeah, when pigs fly. Who's the driver?

18:39.560 --> 18:41.130
That's Javi.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.805
Victor's uncle.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.724
He just got out.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.043
Out? What do you mean "out"?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.561
Out.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.930
Victor polished that rig
every day Javi was inside.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.564
Where's his father?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.050
He's still in there.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.971
See you later, White.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.521
Come in.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.140
Right, I wanna get right to this.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.300
Coach Jenks tells me

19:26.400 --> 19:28.926
that you and he had
an altercation at the game.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.084
- A what?
- An altercation.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.925
Well, I wouldn't...

19:36.240 --> 19:37.446
I wouldn't call it that.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.611
Well, whatever it was,

19:40.760 --> 19:43.140
Coach Jenks doesn't think
this arrangement is gonna work out,

19:43.240 --> 19:44.580
and he's asked for you to step down.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.603
Now, I feel that if he's the coach
of the football team...

19:47.000 --> 19:48.809
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You...

19:50.040 --> 19:51.940
- You're firing me?
- Nobody said you were fired.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.100
Well, he just asked me to step down,
and you didn't say no,

19:54.200 --> 19:55.500
which in my language
means you're firing me.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.523
- Hold on.
- I just moved my family here.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.681
Hold on, Jim!

19:58.800 --> 20:00.484
I don't have the staff
to go around firing people,

20:00.640 --> 20:03.220
because some insecure jerk
who can't stop eating his apple

20:03.320 --> 20:05.721
got all bent out of shape.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.041
- What did you...
- Shut up!

20:08.120 --> 20:10.726
You had a chance to talk
and you let me do it for you.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.927
You're dismissed.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.740
- Am I fired?
- No, you're not fired either.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.921
Now get out of here.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.860
Look, I don't know
if this is a pattern with you,

20:26.960 --> 20:29.420
and I don't know which one of you
was a bigger jerk out there,

20:29.520 --> 20:31.648
but I'm counting on it
that it wasn't you.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.046
Because I need a PE teacher,
and I need a life science teacher.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.721
I don't know how that sits with you,
but that's how it sits.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.365
All right, run a lap.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.521
Go.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.526
Go.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.727
Hi, Jamie.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.887
Hi.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.620
How was school today?

21:13.720 --> 21:15.245
It was okay.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.849
Can I have half of that?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.923
No, but you can have that half.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.361
Yeah, you see that, carnal?

21:25.560 --> 21:26.971
I was down.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.043
How do you like getting smoked?

21:30.920 --> 21:32.126
What now, jefe?

21:32.440 --> 21:33.521
Run another one.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.360
Sure.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.245
Wow. They are fast.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.571
They are.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.801
You want another one?

22:00.920 --> 22:03.260
You know, you're in
the wrong sport, Sameniego.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.647
Not anymore. Coach cut me.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.380
You, too, huh?

22:08.480 --> 22:09.766
Seriously?

22:10.080 --> 22:12.651
You got fired from football?
In your first week?

22:12.760 --> 22:14.649
All right. Don't rub it in.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.250
Congratulations, White.

22:16.760 --> 22:19.127
They're treating you like a picker.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.365
David, Damacio, Danny.
Wake up - it's late.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.847
Your father is waiting in the truck.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.446
Don't be lazy.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.289
The world doesn't wait for you.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.406
May God bless you.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.687
Thank you, Grandma.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.128
David, Damacio - hurry up.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.969
Pay attention and respect your teachers.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.650
See you later.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.201
I hear football didn't work out.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.040
You need something to do
with all of that spare time of yours?

24:06.680 --> 24:07.761
What'd you have in mind?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.041
Migrant parent meetings,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.521
literacy programs, food banks,
support groups.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.260
These families need help.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.361
No, it's not really...

24:15.200 --> 24:16.860
Not really my sort of thing.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.769
You live in McFarland, right?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.723
You ever taken a look out there?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.327
This is one of the poorest
towns in America.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.620
These kids are invisible,
they are expendable.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.940
They come from the fields,
and they go back to the fields

24:29.040 --> 24:31.380
unless the prisons get them first.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.130
You notice we got one right next door?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.324
Yeah, I...

24:37.240 --> 24:38.241
I noticed.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.169
Handy, huh?

24:42.600 --> 24:45.251
Mr. White, it's pretty clear
you don't wanna be here.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.380
But for these kids,
these are the best years of their lives,

24:48.480 --> 24:50.608
and if we're gonna reach them,
now is the time.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.289
But I guess that's not
your kind of thing.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.401
Thanks.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.886
You're welcome.

25:24.640 --> 25:25.766
You know that kid?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.443
Yeah, it's Thomas Valles.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.442
What do you know about him?

25:34.040 --> 25:35.166
Nothing.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.361
You like him.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.681
No, I don't.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.325
She likes him. Get closer.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.642
Dad, don't, please.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.121
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.486
You mind if I shut the door?

25:56.680 --> 25:57.966
This requires a shut door?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.166
Cross country running.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.846
California is holding their first
state championship this year.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.006
Cross country?
That's a private school sport.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.571
They breathe different air than we do.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.926
No, it's the same air.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.049
You do understand we don't
have a cross country team?

26:13.160 --> 26:15.980
Yeah, what I don't understand
is why we have a football team instead.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.340
I mean, we have kids here

26:18.440 --> 26:20.010
who seem like they can run forever.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.340
They carbo-load on rice and beans.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.140
I mean, they pick in extreme heat,

26:24.240 --> 26:25.820
they go to school all day
and some of 'em even run home.

26:25.920 --> 26:26.900
I've seen it.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.500
- And it's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.980
And you've just described
half the kids in the Central Valley.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.570
Jim, let me ask you something.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.260
You've coached cross country before?

26:35.360 --> 26:36.340
No.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.260
- Track?
- No.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.681
But you ran?
Competed in high school maybe?

26:41.800 --> 26:42.740
No.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.001
Well, you sound perfect.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.725
Why are you following me?

27:02.200 --> 27:03.440
Do you know how fast you were going?

27:03.720 --> 27:05.370
What are you, a cop?

27:06.800 --> 27:09.087
Look, I don't know
if this car's speedometer is right,

27:09.200 --> 27:11.043
it's an old car, but if it...

27:11.200 --> 27:13.726
If it is, you're running
almost 12 miles an hour.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.724
Means you'd run a mile in five minutes.

27:17.880 --> 27:18.881
So?

27:19.120 --> 27:20.406
You always run that fast?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.045
I don't got a car, all right?

27:26.200 --> 27:27.486
- Can I give you a lift?
- No.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.049
But you can quit following me.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.603
These are the times
from last year's county meet.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.300
And this is
where Thomas would be right now.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.401
Top 10.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.921
Top 10 in the state,

27:52.080 --> 27:54.208
and he doesn't own a pair
of decent running shoes.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.443
Look, Jim, you might be right.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.282
But there's too many issues here,
the school board being one of them.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.220
But if I had board approval,
you'd back it, right?

28:03.320 --> 28:05.846
Well, yeah, sure,
but that's never gonna happen.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.860
California public school system
pre-approved six new sports

28:09.960 --> 28:12.201
a few years ago to
get funding for new lockers,

28:12.360 --> 28:14.647
including guess what?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.125
Cross country.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.288
And a cross country coach.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.209
Yeah, it says it right here.
"Cross country coach."

28:28.320 --> 28:31.085
First four runners get one of these...

28:31.680 --> 28:32.761
Nice and cold.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.046
Get on the line.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.081
On your marks...

28:41.480 --> 28:42.527
Get set...

28:44.800 --> 28:45.961
Go!

29:05.880 --> 29:09.450
Johnny, stop bothering
those girls and get over here.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.491
Yes.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.000
I wanna ask you a question.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.846
You think the guys in my class
would be into cross country?

29:17.680 --> 29:18.920
Country western ain't my thing, boss.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.604
Cross country running, wise guy.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.820
For what?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.046
To win, to compete.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.140
To impress girls.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.526
Nobody wins around here, White.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.500
Doesn't have to be that way.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.489
I watched you run.
You can beat somebody.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.246
If I felt like it.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.406
Which I don't.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.561
What do you say?

29:38.720 --> 29:39.980
You want to help me get a team together?

29:40.080 --> 29:41.100
How many do we need?

29:41.200 --> 29:42.201
Seven.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.848
You can start with that knucklehead.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.960
Johnny, make sure one of
those guys is Thomas Valles.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.481
Hey, ese.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.140
You wanna be on the running team?

29:57.240 --> 29:58.321
Nope.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.606
Come on, man.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.762
Just think about it. Say yes.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.160
Hey!

30:10.960 --> 30:12.420
I wanna talk to you guys
about a running team.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.500
Johnny.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.580
You wanna be on the running team?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.011
I'll be on the running team.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.929
You guys wanna be on the running team?

30:24.880 --> 30:25.820
Hey!

30:25.920 --> 30:27.081
I got you now, Cardenas.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.166
You are this far from juvie, son.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.607
Jose.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.802
You get me my change?

30:38.480 --> 30:40.289
My change got stuck in the machine.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.540
I asked Jose to get it out for me.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.449
You're not helping them, White.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.490
What did you do that for?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.647
Congratulations.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.524
You just made the cross country team.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.980
I told you to stay away from my sister!

30:58.080 --> 30:59.081
Thomas, don't do that!

30:59.200 --> 31:00.247
Tommy, don't do that!

31:05.800 --> 31:07.768
And so did Thomas Valles.

31:08.280 --> 31:11.060
Do me a favor, Valles.
Act a little happier.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.289
The coach just negotiated you
out of a suspension.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.361
Danny Diaz?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.001
Hey, we needed seven.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.580
Yeah, seven runners,

31:36.680 --> 31:38.380
not six runners and Danny Diaz.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.700
Hey, Danny's our anchor.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.220
And he'll drag our ass down.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.004
All right, knock it off, Puentes.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.202
Let's see if those legs
work as fast as your mouth.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.004
Elmo Bridge and back. Go.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.641
Go.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.441
Hey.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.170
I mean it, all right?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.521
You're my anchor, Danny,
and not because you're fat.

31:56.720 --> 32:00.167
And you are a little fat, okay?
So you better lose some weight.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.100
So, why am I the anchor?

32:02.200 --> 32:03.940
Because you're gonna
hold this team steady, okay?

32:04.040 --> 32:06.540
I lose you, I'll lose your brothers.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.688
You're important, Diaz.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.171
Let's go.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.561
You hot, homes? You tired?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.700
Because anytime you wanna stop,

32:25.800 --> 32:27.325
we're cool with that.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.920
Now I've seen everything.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.601
You guys keep going.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.808
Down to the bridge and back.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.210
I'll time you from here.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.340
Hey, what are you doing?

32:52.440 --> 32:53.441
You can't quit.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.564
Oh, God.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.924
Thank...

33:13.280 --> 33:14.406
Thank you.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.885
Let's get some water.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.205
Where's Victor?

34:03.200 --> 34:04.645
Anybody seen Danny?

34:04.880 --> 34:05.961
There he is.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.161
Yeah, slower than 911
to a Mexican's house.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.768
Those the best running shoes
you guys got?

34:19.920 --> 34:22.650
Best running shoes,
school shoes, church shoes.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.281
- Good, Danny.
- Good job.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.810
Good job, hermano.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.641
All right.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.161
Put them on.

35:07.880 --> 35:08.961
New shoes.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.327
New shorts, man!

35:16.800 --> 35:17.881
Ain't no way I'm wearing these.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.060
Yeah, well, then you're running naked,
because those are our uniforms.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.162
Hey, we wear them, you wear them, ese.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.700
All right, let's hurry up.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.768
Don't forget
to take the tags off, right.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.042
- Coach Jameson?
- Yes, sir?

35:42.160 --> 35:43.810
Jim White, McFarland.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.521
I didn't know McFarland had a team.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.169
Is that them?

35:51.720 --> 35:54.690
Yeah. Yeah.
They're faster than they look.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.681
If you say so.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.009
See you on the course.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.245
Okay, guys.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.250
Okay, here we go.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.300
Remember, scoring is based on
your individual places, all right?

36:11.400 --> 36:13.540
You finish first, that's a 1.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.802
Second, that's a 2, and so on.

36:15.960 --> 36:19.130
The team with the lowest combined score
for their top 5 runners wins.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.646
So the lowest score wins?

36:22.360 --> 36:24.442
That's right, it's like golf.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.611
You think we play golf?

36:26.760 --> 36:29.366
We don't got a country club.
We don't even got a Kmart.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.564
I bet that guy plays golf.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.161
Hold on.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.482
If my score don't count,
why am I even here?

36:36.640 --> 36:37.880
To make us look faster, panzón.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.166
All right, look.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.810
Just try and remember,
lowest score wins.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.940
If you get ahead of
any of their top five guys,

36:43.040 --> 36:44.180
that adds points to their total.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.123
Even you, Danny. Got it?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.445
Doesn't matter.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.050
Let's go show them how it's done.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.529
Come on, Danny!

37:17.600 --> 37:19.841
Where the hell is McFarland?

37:20.680 --> 37:22.603
I hear they can't run
without a cop behind them.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.162
Or a Taco Bell in front of them.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.681
Timers ready?

37:44.080 --> 37:46.003
Runners, take your mark...

37:51.960 --> 37:53.530
Come on.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.691
5: 17. Good pace, Hunter.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.140
5:22, Thomas! Keep that pace!

38:26.240 --> 38:27.810
Come on! Come on! Get it. Get it.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.300
You got him! Come on!

38:31.400 --> 38:32.460
Stay with him! Stay with him!

38:32.560 --> 38:34.140
That's it! That's it!
You're looking great!

38:34.240 --> 38:36.368
Good pace, Robby!
Keep the pace. Keep that up!

38:37.280 --> 38:38.520
Come on. Pick it up.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.808
Go! Go! Go!

38:45.280 --> 38:46.566
Jose, good!

38:47.160 --> 38:48.571
Good, David, good!

38:49.920 --> 38:51.126
Come on, Danny!

39:17.240 --> 39:19.971
That's a boy, Hunter!
Take him, take him!

39:22.240 --> 39:23.220
Come on, kid!

39:23.320 --> 39:24.620
Come on, Hunter.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.060
- Come on!
- Come on.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.446
Power it up!

39:28.040 --> 39:29.140
Come on.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.765
Stay steady. Stay steady.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.260
You got him, Hunter!

39:32.360 --> 39:33.940
Come on! Move it, move it!

39:34.040 --> 39:35.485
You got him! Way to go!

39:35.600 --> 39:37.170
Atta boy! Atta boy!

39:38.400 --> 39:39.890
That's right, bring it home, baby!
Bring it home.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.045
- Nice.
- Come on, buddy.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.420
Come on, come on.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.900
Get up! Let's go.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.980
Blue jersey is right on to you.
Keep that spot.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.081
Kick it!

39:49.720 --> 39:51.340
You can get him! You can get him!

39:51.440 --> 39:52.646
You can get him!

39:53.440 --> 39:54.646
- Keep it!
- Hold that position!

39:56.480 --> 39:57.700
Yes!

39:57.800 --> 39:58.961
Good, Thomas. Good.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.003
Good job, guys! Good job!

40:01.160 --> 40:03.260
Centennial, Centennial,

40:03.360 --> 40:04.805
Palo Alto and Morro Bay.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.445
Finish strong!

40:07.000 --> 40:09.100
Palo Alto, McFarland.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.645
Morro Bay, McFarland.

40:10.960 --> 40:11.940
All the way.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.168
McFarland. McFarland.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.083
Good, Danny, you never stopped.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.361
You never stopped.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.250
And McFarland.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.489
Coming in with a combined score of 35,

40:34.640 --> 40:36.483
the winner is...

40:36.640 --> 40:38.165
Centennial.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.420
Second, Palo Alto, 41.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.500
- Nice!
- Right here!

40:44.600 --> 40:47.260
Third, Morro Bay, 61.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.820
Good job. Yeah.

40:48.920 --> 40:50.524
And in fourth place

40:51.240 --> 40:53.049
with a score of

40:53.200 --> 40:54.361
104...

40:56.160 --> 40:57.446
McFarland.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.540
That's a great race, boys.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.529
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's great guys.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.843
So I guess, better luck next time, boys?

41:07.000 --> 41:08.445
Right? Yeah?

41:08.600 --> 41:11.001
Seriously. Later.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.768
What happened out there today
was not your fault, you hear me?

41:27.400 --> 41:28.686
It was my fault.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.409
I should have checked the course.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.220
That final hill,
I should have known about that.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.049
Thomas would have
eaten that kid's lunch.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.727
What happened out there today
is on me, understood?

41:43.960 --> 41:45.041
Understood?

41:45.200 --> 41:47.362
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.761
Yeah.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.081
Good.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.241
Hello, son.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.086
Say hello to your father.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.260
But fourth place, in your first meet.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.220
That's not too shabby.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.606
Fourth out of four.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.409
Also known as last.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.528
Last doesn't get us out of here.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.122
Last doesn't get me a job
somewhere else.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.204
I'm way too soft on these kids.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.460
Hey.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.767
It's Julie's birthday
tomorrow, remember?

42:48.640 --> 42:51.645
Could you please stop by the store
and pick up her cake on the way home?

42:52.520 --> 42:53.726
Sure.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.322
I got her a really fancy one.
It's beautiful.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.167
Jim?

43:02.960 --> 43:04.620
Birthday dinner is at 6:00, okay?

43:04.720 --> 43:05.801
Okay.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.601
Okay, I hear you.

43:09.760 --> 43:10.966
Okay.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.888
We don't have a hill.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.526
These are our hills.
This is where we're gonna run.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.560
All of them?

43:33.720 --> 43:35.051
That's right.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.043
What happened to us in Palo Alto,

43:37.200 --> 43:38.611
never gonna happen again.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.290
Let's go.

43:40.440 --> 43:41.851
Let's go!

44:07.160 --> 44:08.446
We're done.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.405
Who's done?

44:11.520 --> 44:13.010
We are.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.860
You mean you want to quit?

44:16.960 --> 44:19.167
Go home, stretch out on the couch?

44:19.840 --> 44:20.900
Guess what? Me, too.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.500
But it ain't gonna happen.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.220
Here's what we're gonna do.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.260
We're gonna catch our breath,

44:26.360 --> 44:28.169
and then we're gonna hit it again.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.370
Danny's about to collapse.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.380
It's hard.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.289
- It's hard?
- Yeah.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.100
I'll tell you what's hard,

44:37.200 --> 44:39.140
is watching someone pass you
on that last hill.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.287
Just ask Thomas.

44:41.120 --> 44:44.329
What's hard is losing when you know
you haven't done enough.

44:44.480 --> 44:48.326
All right, we're going to get to the point
where when we see a hill, we smile.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.244
The higher, the better.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.243
All right. Now we know
what we didn't know, right?

44:53.200 --> 44:55.580
Right? Now we know what we didn't know.

44:55.680 --> 44:56.727
Today's the beginning.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.490
Let's hit it again.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.246
Let's hit it again.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.804
Come on, guys.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.128
What are you waiting for, Valles?

45:33.280 --> 45:34.281
Who's got one more?

45:34.760 --> 45:35.966
Come on, lean into this.

45:36.560 --> 45:37.561
Good.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.931
Good.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.084
Come on. Let your arms
take you up that hill.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.740
Change the gear when you go uphill.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.683
You gotta change it.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.123
Change the gear going up that hill!

45:52.200 --> 45:53.690
Come on, Danny, start to give it to me!

45:58.120 --> 46:00.691
If we don't back down
they won't, either.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.046
Come on, Diaz, they're lapping you.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.810
Pick it up, Danny. All right?

46:10.960 --> 46:13.167
You're the anchor. You're not the brake.

46:13.720 --> 46:14.801
Atta boy.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.321
Good, Jose.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.970
You think I'm picking on you, Diaz?

46:19.120 --> 46:21.361
Go faster, I'll pick on somebody else.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.642
Good! Good!

46:25.920 --> 46:28.366
That's it. Take a break.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.330
Okay, good.

46:31.480 --> 46:32.811
Good.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.780
Okay, that's what I wanted to see.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.370
That's how we need to finish.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.522
Good job. Take a break.

46:44.680 --> 46:45.727
Valles!

46:46.680 --> 46:48.330
Valles, I said take a break.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.766
How many more do you want?

46:49.920 --> 46:51.445
10, 20, 100?

46:51.560 --> 46:52.641
Take a break!

46:54.800 --> 46:57.380
You think you're tough, White?
Well, we're tougher, right.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.140
We're not runners. We're pickers.

46:59.240 --> 47:00.740
And we're always gonna be pickers.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.729
And every day we're gonna get up
and do the same thing

47:02.840 --> 47:04.524
over and over again, just like this.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.900
So you can make us do it
a hundred times, a thousand times,

47:08.000 --> 47:09.700
because guess what?

47:09.800 --> 47:11.564
It's never gonna change, all right?

47:22.040 --> 47:24.407
You know what these are, White?

47:24.960 --> 47:26.660
You know what's under here?

47:26.760 --> 47:28.762
Almond hulls. You eat almonds?

47:31.520 --> 47:33.124
You like them?

47:34.240 --> 47:36.288
They come out
the packet real nice, right?

47:38.360 --> 47:39.771
Well, somebody picked those, White.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.201
But you can use them
for hill training, right?

47:49.600 --> 47:50.806
Valles.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.202
Suspend me if you want, man.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.045
I'm done.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.763
Okay, practice is over.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.780
Are you going to leave again?

48:17.880 --> 48:18.927
This is your fault.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.771
Everything is always my fault.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.326
Be quiet.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.325
You've abandoned us.

48:25.880 --> 48:27.041
Be quiet!

49:06.440 --> 49:07.680
Where's the cake?

49:13.320 --> 49:14.890
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.888
I'm sorry I was late.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.289
You forgot it, didn't you?

49:23.320 --> 49:25.800
That's okay.
I didn't really want it anyway.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.004
This was really important to her, Jim.

49:36.600 --> 49:39.206
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry, but my...

49:40.080 --> 49:42.242
My best runner just quit.

49:43.440 --> 49:45.260
No, check that. I mean, I... I mean...

49:45.360 --> 49:48.340
He didn't just quit.
He had some kind of breakdown.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.860
I don't care. Julie is 15 years old,

49:50.960 --> 49:53.247
and you couldn't even remember her cake.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.600
Well, if a missed cake's the worst thing
that ever happens to her,

49:57.720 --> 49:58.940
she's got it over most of these kids.

49:59.040 --> 50:01.486
You know what? She's your daughter, Jim.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.660
And if you think any one
of those fathers out there

50:03.760 --> 50:05.100
would miss their daughter's birthday,

50:05.200 --> 50:07.885
then you oughta go out and see
what kind of cakes they get them.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.247
Julie?

50:21.760 --> 50:23.410
Julie, please let me in.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.565
Go away, Dad.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.001
Thomas?

51:44.000 --> 51:45.365
What are you doing
on the bridge, Thomas?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.125
I don't know.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.927
Who hit you?

51:58.040 --> 51:59.769
No one.

52:04.560 --> 52:07.211
All right, my dad.
But it wasn't his fault.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.568
I don't know about that.

52:11.920 --> 52:14.860
Yeah, well, you don't know
about a lot of things. Okay, White?

52:14.960 --> 52:15.940
You haven't got a clue.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.326
All right, then...

52:18.360 --> 52:20.567
Then explain it to me.
Help me figure it out.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.740
Look, he's a picker.

52:24.840 --> 52:26.660
He's not a foreman like Señor Diaz.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.000
He doesn't run a crew.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.891
He just tries to get
whatever work he can find,

52:32.080 --> 52:34.162
Arizona, Texas, wherever.

52:35.680 --> 52:38.490
And he got back yesterday
and his baby girl is pregnant.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.811
And so he just started
hitting the wall, all right?

52:45.120 --> 52:48.090
And I was trying to get him to stop,
and I just got in the way.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.460
Look, if he hurts his hands,
he can't work.

52:54.560 --> 52:55.607
Do you get that?

52:56.160 --> 52:57.161
Okay.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.843
Okay, Thomas, I get it.

53:08.880 --> 53:10.962
Do you want to know why I'm out here,

53:13.400 --> 53:16.085
middle of night,
driving around by myself?

53:17.120 --> 53:18.645
No.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.610
Too bad. I'm gonna tell you anyway.

53:23.040 --> 53:25.691
I forgot to buy
my daughter's birthday cake.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.964
That's bad, White.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.924
Look, you...

53:37.480 --> 53:40.245
You scared me today. You did.
And you're...

53:41.120 --> 53:44.010
You're scaring me now,
so you wanna come off of there?

53:45.480 --> 53:46.561
No.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.380
Okay, then let me tell you the truth

53:52.480 --> 53:54.608
about what happens,
how this ends, if you...

53:55.760 --> 53:57.569
If you fall from here.

54:00.120 --> 54:02.970
If you go off this bridge tonight,
and there's every chance you might,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.844
you'll probably live, all right?

54:07.880 --> 54:09.723
It's not that high,
but I promise you, Thomas,

54:09.840 --> 54:12.969
there's no chance you'll ever run again.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.565
None.

54:17.520 --> 54:20.524
And right now I'm guessing
running's the best thing you've got.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.580
Feels as if it might be
the only thing you've got.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.841
Come on down.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.325
Okay?

54:51.720 --> 54:53.210
So you wanna...

54:54.680 --> 54:57.126
You wanna keep going
with this cross country thing?

55:03.520 --> 55:05.329
Me, too.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.568
Me, too.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.286
You shorten your stride,

55:48.880 --> 55:51.451
lean into the hill, and lower your head.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.765
This is the only place
you'll ever do this in cross country.

56:02.960 --> 56:03.961
Julie?

56:08.120 --> 56:11.124
Nobody can hold a grudge
like a teenage girl.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.567
How about her mom?

56:13.800 --> 56:15.165
I'm working on it.

56:20.760 --> 56:22.285
Don't even think about it.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.220
All right, I'm not the ice cream man.

56:50.320 --> 56:51.300
Six miles.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.846
Same pace, all right?
Gotta lay down our base.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.441
Johnny.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.660
Johnny, why are your arms
flying around everywhere?

56:57.760 --> 56:59.125
I don't know.
Why you riding a Barbie bike?

56:59.640 --> 57:01.005
Because it's pretty?

57:01.680 --> 57:03.250
I bet you got
the matching doll house, too, huh?

57:04.160 --> 57:06.128
Which one are you, White? Blanco Barbie?

57:06.760 --> 57:08.420
All right, joke less, run more.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.500
Everybody tuck your arms in.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.931
You're all starting to look
like the mangy chicken

57:11.120 --> 57:13.805
I got hanging around my house.

57:14.120 --> 57:15.610
You're not smiling, are you, Valles?

57:15.840 --> 57:16.887
No.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.326
No, I didn't think so.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.482
Be warm and loose
for the start of the race.

57:33.720 --> 57:36.326
That's right, fellas.
Stay nice and relaxed.

57:39.240 --> 57:40.446
Nice work.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.085
Okay. Come on.

57:42.920 --> 57:43.967
Come on.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.326
Everybody all right?

57:48.520 --> 57:50.921
This is a dual meet,
just us and them, all right?

57:51.080 --> 57:53.686
Clovis versus McFarland. They're good,

57:53.840 --> 57:55.205
they're ranked,

57:55.920 --> 57:57.365
and they think we're pushovers.

57:58.840 --> 58:00.046
You ready?

58:02.200 --> 58:03.326
Let's do it, Blanco.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.561
All right.

58:09.120 --> 58:10.201
Where are we from?

58:10.360 --> 58:12.089
- Uno, dos, tres...
- McFarland!

58:26.040 --> 58:27.087
All D block...

58:27.360 --> 58:29.089
All D block inmates, 15 minutes.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.128
Can they even understand you?

59:04.360 --> 59:07.569
You probably just point, huh?
"Go that way, amigo."

59:09.000 --> 59:11.082
Yeah, something like that.

59:13.880 --> 59:15.723
15:40, Derek!

59:15.880 --> 59:17.723
Just cruise to win.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.882
15:45, Thomas!

59:22.520 --> 59:23.567
Now, go get him.

59:26.240 --> 59:27.287
Go get him.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.121
Atta boy.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.726
Atta boy.

59:41.240 --> 59:42.241
Come on, Thomas.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.371
16:30, Thomas. Good job.

59:58.680 --> 59:59.966
Atta boy, Johnny.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.085
Jose, good.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.921
Come on, Danny.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.088
- Come on, Sean.
- Come on, Danny!

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.570
That's what I have.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.322
Well, it was close, boys.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.606
Like I said...

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.930
They're a great team.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.446
But you're better.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.249
Clovis scored 28.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.860
McFarland, 27.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.940
Hang on. You mean...

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.168
That's right. Lowest score wins.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.123
You just won your first race.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.841
Good race, amigo.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.841
I told you we were gonna win.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.801
Car trouble, honey?

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.883
Come on in, baby,
we'll get you fixed up.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.970
Come on in.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.090
Where are the Diazes?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.847
Out.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.020
"Out"? What do you mean "out"?

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.531
Out like off the team.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.241
What?

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.685
- Says who?
- Says their father

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.205
who's also their foreman.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.525
My boyfriend's got a garage in the back.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.883
He'll take a look
at that little car of yours.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.060
Thank you.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.491
There you go.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.569
Oh, my goodness, honey.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.849
What have you been
doing with these hands?

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.891
Moving houses, I guess,
trying to make a garden.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.644
Just sit back, enjoy the view,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.129
and we will get you out of here
in no time.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.406
That's my boyfriend.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.610
He's handsome, isn't he?

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.001
I know.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.380
Hey, Damacio.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.220
Look, you wouldn't understand.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.560
Damacio...

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.420
This was our teacher
for running, Mr. White.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.329
He just stopped by real quick to say hi.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.725
You wanna eat?

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.762
Hope you like enchiladas, White.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.926
Ready to try it?

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.809
A little bit.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.851
How many is that? Seven? Eight?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.801
Saying no is rude.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.361
Yeah, so is puking on the table.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.683
Take home to the family.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.688
No, no, señora, please.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.900
- Gracias, but I couldn't.
- No.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.820
Don't say to me no, okay?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.060
My husband always working,

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.900
but every day he's sitting
at the table with his family.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.764
He's talking and he's listening.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.042
How you gonna be family
if you no eating together, huh?

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.365
I want that back.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.285
Can I give you a hand with those tubs?

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.165
Just saying...

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.924
Can I help you out?

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.000
No, gracias.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.847
David...

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.420
I'd like you to ask your father
something for me.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.601
Yeah.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.323
You know what? Just tell him...

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.580
Just tell him it was an honor
to be invited into his home.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.286
Dad, he said it was an honor
to be invited into your home.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.890
Tell him I say thanks.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.731
I'm sorry, I thought you...

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.410
I get by.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.242
Thank you for your hospitality.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.960
We don't ask for help around here.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.940
You want to help me wash my buckets?

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.486
You want to be
a helpful person, that's okay.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.460
But I know why you're here.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.688
You want my sons to run a race.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.540
Mr. White,

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.247
your sport is like a TV.
It's not essential.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.900
Each hour that my boys train with you

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.207
is one hour they do not work with me.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.241
That's food off our table.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.051
I don't expect a man like you
to understand.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.205
Blanco?

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.761
What are you doing here?

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.006
You know you're white, right?

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.740
You sure about this?

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.923
Yeah, don't white people
mow their lawns on Saturday?

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.004
I haven't got a lawn.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.845
What are we doing?

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.844
You're not gonna like it.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.486
Blanco?

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.489
Now you just gotta lean it over

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.240
and cut.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.171
Take off the outer leaves
and turn it over.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.180
This will be your row, okay?

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.248
Keep your knees bent
or it'll hurt your back.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.324
You okay, Blanco?

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.531
You guys do this all day?

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.087
Yeah.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.084
Get this field done,
maybe start on another one.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.885
You get paid by the hour?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.520
Not by the hour, by the field.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.484
The faster we get this one done,
the more our father makes.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.641
By the field?

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.370
Hey, Damacio, how old were
you guys when you started

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.567
working for your dad?

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.765
10? 11?

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.321
Is that even legal?

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.806
Strawberries, it is. And potatoes.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.487
Other crops, you gotta be 12.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.540
I remember, first day I started,

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.120
I wanted to quit after the first hour
because it was so hard.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.646
Cried like a baby.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.087
Yeah, I know how you feel.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.723
You wanna quit, Blanco?

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.841
What do you think?

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:53.725
Blanco?

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.020
I'm sorry, it's my back.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.884
I know, I know. Just lie down.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.481
Face down. Come on.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.368
Yeah. It's okay.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
It's okay.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.660
You just gotta do this
every few hours when you first start.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.205
Your body's not used to it.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.006
Okay, listen, guys. I get it.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.008
Your father needs you.
All right, so this is...

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.620
Thank you. This is what we do.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.088
On days you have to pick late,
we practice later.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.411
All right? And the days we have meets,
you pick extra early

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.688
and you still make your dad's quota.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.604
I'll pick with you if I have to.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.445
Only if you have to though,
right, Coach?

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.841
Because you don't
look too good right now.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.964
"Coach"? You sure about that?

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.282
Not "Blanco"? Not "White"?

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.606
Not "homes"?

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.201
No. Coach.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.090
Coach. Good.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.540
What are you eating there?

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.660
Tacos. You want one?

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.125
No, give me two.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.326
I'm just saving you, Danny.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.380
Can you pass me another one, sweetheart?

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.527
Yep.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.205
Got it, got it.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.921
What's going on?

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.100
Tamale sale.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.580
- And car wash.
- Team fundraiser.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.727
This afternoon.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.300
- Can you help me with this, babe?
- Yeah.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.926
My boys running for you,
they need new uniforms,

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.980
and better shoes.
Why you buy them the cheap shoes?

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.161
You're not proud of them?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.042
You are a good man and so I helping you.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.204
Okay, now go shower.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.606
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken!

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.820
And how many tickets
did you say your mama sold?

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.321
You better hope
only half of them show up.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.368
Well, let's get our buckets, guys.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.660
- Hey, Cheryl! Hi, honey.
- Lupe!

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.820
How you been?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.048
I'm so good. How are you?

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.580
Do you remember my boyfriend, Javi?

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.820
- Yes. Javi, how are you?
- Hey, good to see you.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.729
This is my husband, Jim.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.167
- What's up? Javier. Javi.
- Hello.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.403
Yeah, my sister's boy
is on your team. Victor.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.291
You know, Javi,
I think I owe you an apology.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.525
That first night we were here,
on that Friday night, I saw you...

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.722
And your cars and I thought you were...

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.325
Gangbangers?

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.100
Maybe once upon a time, homes.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.850
We're just a car club, man.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.050
Look at these cars, man.
They're our babies.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.844
We wouldn't wanna put them in danger.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.365
Plus, man...

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.620
If we commit a crime,
what's the first thing

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.100
the witness is gonna notice?

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.440
The paint job.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.930
Hey, Victor.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.100
You're gonna mess up
the paint job, homes.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.248
Hey, don't scratch my face, ese.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.965
Look, look.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.122
Lupe! Beautiful!

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.860
Jim, you gotta see this.
You've got to see this.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.122
- Come on, come on.
- Check it out.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.844
Do you like it?

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.006
Yes.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.928
He appreciates me.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.300
Oh, boy.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.687
I wish you appreciated me
more like that.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.571
What you got your nose in, Coach?

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.366
"The McFarland Cougars
are making an impression.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.860
"It started with a stunning upset,
beating Clovis High,

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.060
"but then consecutive victories
over Yosemite and Morro Bay

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.620
"left the racing community
and everyone else asking the question,

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.405
"'Just where did these
McFarland runners come from?'"

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.364
Some good news for a change.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.766
You said it.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.607
Jim, you have a minute?

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.731
Listen to this. It's from Jose Cardenas.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.940
"We fly like blackbirds
through the orange groves,

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.780
"floating on a warm wind.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.500
"When we run, we own the earth.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.082
"The land is ours.
We speak the birds' language.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.723
"Not immigrants no more.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.803
"Not stupid Mexicans.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.780
"When we run, our spirits fly.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.008
"We speak to the gods.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.482
"When we run, we are the gods."

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.489
It's good work, White.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.845
Yeah. Jose is a good kid.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.722
I don't mean Jose.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.648
Welcome to McFarland, Blanco.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.642
You know the way I used to coach,

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.920
I'd take soft kids and kick their butts
till they toughened up.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.566
You think that's funny?

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.580
You beating up some white kids, White?

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.920
I think that's funny.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.604
You know, I don't know if you know,

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.761
but if we keep going
the way we're going,

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.609
you guys have a chance
to qualify for State.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.806
Really?

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.200
Yeah, really.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.204
But it doesn't matter what I think, okay?
I can't do it for you.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.980
And I don't have to be the one to tell you
that the odds are stacked against you.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.411
But if you...

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.020
If you believe in yourselves
and maybe more importantly,

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:34.500
you find a way to believe
in each other, in your teammates,

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.090
it won't matter what anyone else thinks.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.484
That's the beauty of sports.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.721
We don't practice to lose, homes.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.046
I mean, Coach.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.300
You don't eat the produce, Coach.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.526
What?

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.250
You don't eat the produce.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.126
First rule of picking,
you eat it, you're fired.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.881
God, I'm sorry, guys. I didn't...

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.564
All of you, dead.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.840
Come on, White!

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.209
When we...

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.331
When we qualify, your world can
start to look very different.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.443
Coach, don't you mean "if'?

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.602
No, I mean "when."

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.300
All right, so start thinking
about what college

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.606
you're gonna apply to.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.086
Cal Poly's got...

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.045
Agriculture, crop science,

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.561
viticulture.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.769
I wouldn't be surprised if you kids
knew half that stuff already.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.487
Think about it, guys.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.300
Cal Poly's only
a few hours from here. All right.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.406
You can still help your parents out
on the weekend, but if you get a degree...

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.780
You get a degree,

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.848
and you have to read it
to get a degree...

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.660
You're gonna be able to
help them out a lot more

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.570
than the money you make
out in the fields. All right?

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.446
Right?

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.162
Things are going really well for me.
Coach thinks we can make it to finals.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.770
Maybe...

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.330
I can get into college.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.601
College?

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.404
You know what...

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.120
Take your face out of those books.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.606
They're going to ruin your eyes.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.486
Nobody ever needed a book in the fields.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.363
How big?

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.683
I told you 20 times, Danny, very.
All right?

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.203
Don't worry. That's why we trained.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.569
I know, but how big?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.604
That big.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.241
Take a good look, guys,

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.601
because this is
where we qualify for State.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.244
All we gotta do is be in the top four.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.447
That's it.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.921
Hey.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.241
Congratulations.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.931
Team to watch.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.140
Thanks.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.402
And coach to watch.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.641
Palo Alto's got its eye on you.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.340
There could be something coming up,
if you're interested.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.442
Coaches, you have three minutes.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.409
Thanks. Good luck out there.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.289
You, too, Coach.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.980
Okay. Come on.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.287
Everybody, get in here. Come on.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.927
Danny, quit looking at the mountain.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.969
It's not going away and neither are you.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.610
You're gonna be all right.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.848
I've seen you out in the fields.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.246
You're an ox.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.124
So when you're in pain
out there on this mountain,

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.601
I want you to remember,
so is the guy next to you,

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.171
and the guy in front of you.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.961
This is gonna come down to which
runners can handle the pain.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.220
So I want you to look at them,

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.380
and I want you to look
at each other and ask yourself,

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.845
"Who's tougher?"

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.209
My money's on you.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.321
Call it, Danny.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.804
Uno, dos, tres.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.604
- McFarland!
- Come on.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.700
Runners, on your mark.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.165
Okay, let's go.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.603
Nice shorts, dude.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.900
You play golf?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.047
Yeah, I do.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.280
This ain't golf.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.680
Set...

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.208
Run! Run!

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.487
Come on.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.281
- Go!
- Come on!

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.201
Go!

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.801
Come on.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.321
Come on, you got it!

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.005
Push it, push it!

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.500
How did we do? Did we make it?

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.601
It's close.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.845
We're right on the edge.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.567
Look at that.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.889
Look at that. You did it.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.842
Best in California.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.843
McFarland's going to State,
you hear that?

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.049
We're going to State.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.887
McFarland is going to State.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.961
Hey, Coach,

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.721
you missed the turn.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.043
That's right.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.761
Hi.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.088
That will be $9.50.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.607
Look, I...

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.131
I got...

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.449
I got five bucks, all right?

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.122
I got five bucks
and seven kids back there,

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.091
that have never seen the ocean.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.926
- Keep it.
- Are you sure?

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.766
Keep it.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.521
Thanks.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.365
Well, go on.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.691
Get in there.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.126
Yeah, let's go, guys!

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.249
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.321
We're going to State!

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.041
Yeah!

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.720
Okay, no, just stay.
No moving. No moving.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.483
Okay. McFarland Cougars!

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.530
That's fantastic.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.561
Wow.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.929
Does Cougars look like
it's spelled right to you?

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.889
You tell her and we kill you, man.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.565
Danny!

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.886
Yay!

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.601
I see David!

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.731
Damacio!

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.284
Okay, foto. Ven.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.051
No. No, don't say to me "no." Come on.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.610
Okay. Cougars, one, two, three.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.125
Cougars!

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.370
Okay.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.809
My family.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.644
You must be very proud.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.249
How old are your daughters,
Señor Blanco?

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.841
Jamie's 10 and Julie just turned 15.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.806
When is her quinceañera?

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.241
What?

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.524
I'm gonna put it in the front window.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.603
Can you imagine if we beat
the whole damn state?

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.128
I might actually have to
close the store for a day.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.169
First time in 25 years.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.805
Sammy, I think...

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.646
I think I'm gonna need
your help with something.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.367
Come on, guys, gotta go. Come on.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:13.540
You'll be late.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.007
Made the appointment for 4:00.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.001
Why are you doing this?

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.006
I appreciate you. Can't a man
show a little appreciation?

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.531
Okay.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.161
We got three hours.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.684
Okay. So...

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.371
I guess we move this picnic table

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.041
over here, right?

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.042
Blanco, this is gonna go a lot quicker,

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.168
if we remember one important thing.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.004
- Yeah, what's that?
- We're not the chiefs,

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.208
we're the Indians. Sit down.

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.887
Can one of you move this table to the
garage, because this is the dance floor.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.202
Let me take care of that.
Get up, Thomas.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.740
- It's so good to see you.
- Come on in, my ladies.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.820
We're gonna make you look so beautiful!

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.241
Oh, my goodness, look at this hair.

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.046
Here.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.248
What is it? What is it?

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.970
Oh, my gosh.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.529
It's called a quinceañera.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.321
- Give me that drink.
- All right.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:01.649
Señoras y señores, Miss Julie White.

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.530
Pretty.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.047
Time to talk, Papacito.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.300
First, I'd like to thank
the Rosaldo family,

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.609
who were so kind
to help me put this together.

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:50.980
And to everyone here

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.765
who have been so generous
to us along the way.

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.620
And muchos gracias for
helping me to understand

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.883
what a quinceañera means,

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.008
and why this night is so important.

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.851
Because it means,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.844
our daughter's turning
from this young girl

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.569
to a beautiful woman.

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.806
I don't know if Julie knows

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.367
how much I've struggled with this,

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.200
but tonight I celebrate it.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.240
I hope you know how much
you mean to me, and how

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.660
being your dad and Jamie's,

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.491
makes me prouder than you'll ever know.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.449
And how I hope to one day

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.809
make you proud, too.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.921
As proud...

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.762
As proud as these kids are
of their parents.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.442
So, now I guess
I get to ask you to dance.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.605
And...

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.010
And apparently,
you're not allowed to say no.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.970
Thank you, Dad.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.802
You look so beautiful.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.806
Thank you.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.601
Julie?

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.327
Yes?

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:05.691
My grandmother made it.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.041
You're welcome.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.366
Here, would you?

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.646
Yeah.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.047
Are you ready?

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.530
For what?

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.886
Come on.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.730
Relax, Blanco. This is what we do.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.723
We take the birthday girl on parade.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.723
Dad, can I?

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.611
You got her?

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.521
I got her.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.726
You'll go slow, right?

01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.884
It's the only way we go, brother.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.287
Low and slow.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.081
All right.

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.401
Thank you.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.326
Let's go.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.380
You look beautiful!

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:23.244
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.290
Bye!

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.121
Thanks for driving, Javi.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.646
Wow, thank you so much!

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.801
Javi.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.085
My God, Javi,
why won't they leave you in peace?

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.201
It was so amazing. So amazing.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.844
Get it, please?

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.569
Quinceañera headquarters.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.885
Excuse me?

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.806
Get the keys.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.046
Why?

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.780
There.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.740
No, please. Dear God, no.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.365
That doesn't mean anything yet, honey.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.887
Baby... Please, please, please.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.660
Julie!

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:10.886
Julie, oh, baby!

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.246
Oh, baby.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.960
Julie, sweetheart.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.201
Mom, I'm okay.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.020
Please, is she okay?

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.700
Stay calm, miss.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.780
- I fell.
- I know, I know.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.086
This car came out of nowhere...

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.210
Then this other car came.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.620
And then some guys got out
and everyone was yelling,

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.210
and there was all this blood.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.642
- They had knives.
- It's okay.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.921
What do you mean?

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.041
What happened?

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.768
What happened? You said you had her!

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.291
You said she was safe!

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.641
I trusted you.

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.323
I trusted you with my daughter.

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.766
She was safe.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.651
Maybe you ought to ask her
just how safe she was.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.020
She wasn't hurt, Jim.

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.820
She's all right. She's gonna be fine.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.980
Fine? No.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.140
Not fine.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.129
Not fine at all. It was a bloodbath!

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.645
Half a mile away from our home
with our daughter!

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.525
Not fine.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.721
Mom.

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.446
Hi, baby. Come here.

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.740
How are you feeling?

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.171
Fine.

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.525
Where's Dad?

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:29.740
Good morning, Jim.

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.411
Good to see ya. Thanks for coming.

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.930
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.211
How'd it go?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.968
They offered me a full-time position.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.722
Cross country and track.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.125
It's a state-of-the-art facility.
I'd be head of the program.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.126
Gonna take it?

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.201
I don't know. Where are the girls?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.721
Jamie's in her bedroom
and Julie's with Sonia, upset.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.121
Does she know?

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.966
She knows where you went.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.481
Julie.

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.287
Julie.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.286
Get in the car, please.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.969
Were you even gonna tell us?

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.860
Or were you just gonna
watch us compete at State

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:04.406
then run off into the sunset
with those country club kids?

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.380
Were you even gonna say adiós, Blanco?

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.130
- Thomas, listen to me.
- No.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.805
All right, I get it.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.849
We all get it.

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.610
This is America, right?

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.450
You gotta go bigger.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:21.444
Find a nicer place.

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.325
Better pay...

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.645
With better everything.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.244
Everyone is always gonna
go for the better everything.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.740
And that's why no one stays in McFarland

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.569
unless they have to.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:39.201
Because there ain't nothing
"American dream" about this place.

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:52.005
It feels like everything
we've ever wanted.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.531
Everything we've ever talked about.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.846
You know, big house,

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.001
financial security,

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.980
great school for the kids,
nice neighborhood.

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.526
Nice safe neighborhood.

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.050
I don't know.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.849
What do you mean you don't know?

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.140
The owner of the corner store

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.060
was washing away blood
from his parking lot

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.322
when I drove out this morning.

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.608
Jim, the owner of the store has a name,

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.888
and he's our friend.

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.170
And you looked him in the eye
two days ago

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.780
and thanked him for
everything he's done for us.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.848
I know. I know.

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.820
But you were there. We were there.

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.620
Julie was... How close?

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.260
This close?

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.045
How can that not bother you?

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.860
It bothers me.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.042
Of course it bothers me.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.209
But do you know how she got hurt?

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.406
Your team jumped in front of her.

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.780
They pushed her out of the way.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.820
They protected her
like she was their family.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.540
You think she's gonna
find that in Palo Alto?

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.563
Or anywhere else for that matter?

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.643
I don't know.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.566
It's your decision, okay?

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:16.163
And I know it's hard.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:21.881
But, please don't just let
this be about our safety.

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.088
Because nowhere I've ever lived
has ever felt this much like home.

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.126
Okay.

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.925
Coach! Coach! Coach!

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.481
Yeah!

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.610
Cougars! Cougars! Cougars!

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.444
It's for you!

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.604
Good luck!

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:58.444
Coach! Coach! Coach!

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.883
Bring it home, Jim.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.522
Make us proud, Coach!

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.690
Why are you even here?

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.485
All right, we don't need you to coach.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.970
Rules say you can't run without a coach.

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.724
You forfeit the race.

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.530
So if you still wanna run, Thomas,

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.811
you're gonna need to take a seat.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.161
Great day!

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.771
I think he's over there. Right there.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.965
Check. Mic check.

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.082
Testing, testing!

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.091
All right, guys. Here we go.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.740
Check, check, check.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.444
How's that?

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.964
Please rise for the singing
of the national anthem.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.580
Oh, say can you see...

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:06.966
Up.

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.566
By the dawn's early light

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.569
What so proudly we hailed

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.885
At the twilight's last gleaming

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.403
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:29.486
Through the perilous fight

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.005
O'er the ramparts we watched

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.882
Were so gallantly streaming

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.325
And the rocket's red glare

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:24.050
...and the home of the brave

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.561
Coaches, you have three minutes.

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.164
All right, everybody, gather around.

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.405
Come on.

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.608
I want you to look around.

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.610
Best in the state, right?

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.728
Every team that's here deserves to be,

01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:51.004
including you.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.564
But they haven't got what you got.
All right?

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.724
They don't get up at dawn like you
and go to work in the fields.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.410
Right?

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.006
They don't go to school all day
and then go back to those same fields.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:04.924
That's what you do.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:09.020
And then you come out with me
and you run 8 miles, 10 miles,

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.660
and you take on...

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.900
You take on even more pain.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.004
These kids don't do what you do.
They can't even imagine it.

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.482
When I went out in the field
that day with you Diaz kids,

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.324
I'll be honest with you, it was a...

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.327
It was the worst day's work
I ever had to do in my life.

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:30.460
And I said to myself, "Whatever
kind of crappy job I end up in,

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:32.562
"it'll never be as tough as that."

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.420
You kids do it every day.

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.540
And your parents hope
they can do it every day,

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:43.326
and they'll do it for a lifetime
if it means a better life for you.

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.644
You guys are super-human.

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:54.940
What you endure just to be here,
to get a shot at this,

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:58.089
the kind of privilege
that someone like me takes for granted?

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:02.940
There's nothing you can't do
with that kind of strength,

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.929
with that kind of heart.

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.441
You kids have the biggest hearts
I've ever seen.

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:16.887
Now go run your race.

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.401
Thomas, you're the captain.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.644
Hey, Coach.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.851
You wanna call it?

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:01.286
Uno, dos, tres.

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.601
McFarland!

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:16.971
Gentlemen,

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.600
your command will be
"Runners, take your mark,"

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:21.564
followed by the pistol.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.170
I will not fire the gun,

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:27.211
until I see that everyone
is standing still

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:29.522
with your toes behind the line.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:33.044
Good luck today, gentlemen.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.562
Runners, take your mark!

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:03.566
Jose, no.

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:05.326
Jose!

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:14.281
What's he doing?

01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.371
Jose, back it down!

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:17.760
Find your pace!

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.120
Come on! Come on! Go, go, go.

01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:20.731
He's too fast! He's gonna die!

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.882
Then make up for it! Make up for it!

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.700
Where's Victor?

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.723
You're right there, Victor.
You're right there.

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.366
Damacio, stay right with him.
Hold onto Victor!

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.851
Keep those legs! Let's go!

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:31.961
Good, Johnny!

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.647
Come on, Johnny!

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:35.000
Catch that next group, Johnny.

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:36.207
Get into that next group!

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:43.885
Keep going!

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.129
Sorry, man. Sorry.

01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.220
Here they are.

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.940
Yay, McFarland! Go, guys!

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.100
Come on, McFarland!

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:09.567
Damacio! McFarland!

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.971
What's happening, Mom?

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.531
Looks like he's run out of gas.

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:17.290
The others will have
to make up the points.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.500
That's it. Pick up the pace!

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.140
Let's go! Let's go!
Close it up! Close it up!

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:43.420
Let's go! Cut the distance!

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.500
You're stretching it out!

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:45.580
Come on!

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:48.047
10:00 flat, Thomas! Come on!
You can do it!

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.521
You gotta get ahead of three guys!
Come on!

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.100
Come on, Victor!

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:53.300
Only seconds off pace! Let's go!

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.925
Come on, Damacio!

01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.260
Hold onto those guys! Hold onto them!

01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:58.500
Lets' go!

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.284
Bring it up! Bring it up!

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.483
McFarland!

01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:50.321
Beat him, Thomas.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:03.641
Yes!

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.443
Damacio, come on! There's Damacio!

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.247
Yes!

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.409
- Where's Jose?
- I don't know.

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:21.900
Come on.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.844
He's more than a minute slower
than his usual times. It's...

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.300
It's not gonna be enough.

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.405
Look, David will come in next,
but not for another 30 seconds. See.

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.820
- Coach... Coach.
- Even then, it's not gonna...

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.860
- It's not gonna matter unless...
- Coach.

01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:37.644
You can do it. Yeah.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:42.660
That's not Danny Diaz.

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:44.922
- Come on, Danny!
- That's not Danny Diaz!

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:48.727
Come on! Yeah!

01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:03.403
- Danny!
- Danny!

01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.961
Yeah!

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.451
Number five.

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.250
You're our number five runner, man!

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:23.042
Did you picture
the finish line as a donut or what?

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.620
Hey...

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:29.780
Hey, where did you come from, Diaz?

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:31.484
Where did you come from?

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.808
From McFarland, Coach.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.606
Let's go.

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
we do apologize for the delay.

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:37.620
It was a very close race
and we needed to be sure.

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:40.644
But we can now announce
that the first ever

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:44.043
California State Cross Country
Champion team is...

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:47.007
McFarland!

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.060
The McFarland High School Cougars
are the cross-country champs

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:54.561
of the state of California.
Congratulations.

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.764
Boo-yah! We won! I can't believe we won!

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.806
State Champ!

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:18.846
McFarland!

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.729
McFarland, baby!

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:21.927
McFarland!

02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:36.801
Danny!

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.407
Yeah! McFarland!

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.566
McFarland?

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.411
McFarland. McFarland.

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.366
McFarland!

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.409
McFarland! McFarland!
