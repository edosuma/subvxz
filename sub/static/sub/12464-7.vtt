WEBVTT

00:04.804 --> 00:06.205
Hi, mom.

00:06.207 --> 00:10.109
doing community service
at the senior center.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.810
Helping people feels so great.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.113
Wow, Maddie.
I'm so glad.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.547
Would you help me
set the table?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.716
Ugh! I'm so tired.

00:19.052 --> 00:22.521
I chair the ridgewood high
community service campaign.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.924
My community service is
to make sure those lazy slackers

00:25.926 --> 00:27.993
do their community service.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.562
I am so proud of you and Liv.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.097
But I'm surprised you didn't
pick the same project.

00:32.099 --> 00:35.634
I think Liv knows that
the senior center is my turf.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.969
I've been there for two years.

00:36.971 --> 00:38.637
Plus it's all
florescent lighting.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.639
She says it makes her look
like she has the flu.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.075
Well, she was
unbelievably excited

00:43.077 --> 00:45.611
about volunteering
for "Beautify Wisconsin."

00:45.613 --> 00:48.047
( Laughs ) Yeah,
wait till she finds out

00:48.049 --> 00:50.716
what "Beautify Wisconsin"
actually means.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.957
Turns out "beautify Wisconsin"

00:58.959 --> 01:01.660
is <i>not </i> going door-to-door
giving makeovers.

01:04.297 --> 01:07.066
I spent two hours in a ditch

01:07.068 --> 01:09.568
picking up anything that people
threw out of their cars,

01:09.570 --> 01:10.969
cigarette butts,
potato chip bags,

01:10.971 --> 01:12.638
and most humiliating of all

01:12.640 --> 01:15.340
the season one DVD
of "Sing It Loud."

01:16.676 --> 01:17.743
( Snorts )

01:20.313 --> 01:22.347
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:23.916
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

01:23.918 --> 01:26.185
<i>¶ b... b... better in stereo</i>

01:26.187 --> 01:28.320
- <i>¶ I'm up with the sunshine</i>
<i>- ¶ Let's go</i>

01:28.322 --> 01:30.622
- <i>¶ I lace up my high tops</i>
<i>- ¶ Oh no</i>

01:30.624 --> 01:32.257
<i>¶ slam dunk, ready or not ¶</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:34.226
<i>¶ yeah, show me what you got ¶</i>

01:34.228 --> 01:36.628
- ¶ I'm under the spotlight

01:36.630 --> 01:38.630

01:38.632 --> 01:41.100
<i>¶ you dance to your own beat ¶</i>

01:43.104 --> 01:45.604

02:07.928 --> 02:10.129
<i>¶ we're better in stereo.</i>

02:12.298 --> 02:14.733
( Cheering )

02:14.735 --> 02:16.635
All right, all right,
porcupines.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.172
Friday night we play
our biggest rivals,

02:20.174 --> 02:22.374
the Fairview tiger sharks!

02:22.376 --> 02:24.276
( Booing )

02:24.278 --> 02:27.980
And every year,
those tiger sharks

02:27.982 --> 02:30.282
try to steal
our beloved mascot,

02:30.284 --> 02:32.284
Paulie the porcupine!

02:32.286 --> 02:34.286
( Cheering )

02:34.288 --> 02:37.389
But the night
before the big game,

02:37.391 --> 02:39.091
two freshman are chosen

02:39.093 --> 02:40.759
to watch over Paulie.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.395
As basketball team captain,
I have selected

02:43.397 --> 02:45.797
Joey Rooney and Skippy Ramirez

02:45.799 --> 02:48.300
to keep Paulie safe
from the tiger sharks.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.936
( Booing )

02:50.938 --> 02:53.405
I'm sorry.
Just to be clear,
are you booing us

02:53.407 --> 02:55.240
or are you booing
the tiger sharks?

02:55.242 --> 02:56.909
( Booing )

02:56.911 --> 02:58.410
Dude, stop saying tiger sharks.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.945
( Booing )

02:59.947 --> 03:03.982
( Nervous laugh )
We are your Paulie protectors.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.251
( Cheering )

03:06.253 --> 03:07.286
Yeah.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.055
I begged diggie for this job.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.824
If Skippy and I could
keep Paulie safe all night,

03:12.826 --> 03:14.760
we'd get the honor of...

03:14.762 --> 03:17.796
Hanging the first bratwurst link
around Paulie's neck.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.698
It's like winning
an olympic medal,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.400
but with meat.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.304
Okay, silver steppers,

03:25.306 --> 03:26.972
you are doing great.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.908
Now remember,
exercise reverses
the aging process.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.176
So pretty soon,
with a little bit of work,

03:31.178 --> 03:32.778
you will all look 70 again.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.914
And if you get
any younger than that,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.984
then you'll have to pay
full price at the movie theater.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.953
Okay, get ready
to switch stations.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.454
And go.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.156
( Whistle blows )

03:44.158 --> 03:46.258
Hey, if you really want
to get their attention,

03:46.260 --> 03:48.160
yell "bingo."

03:48.162 --> 03:50.229
They'll listen to anything
you say after that.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.398
I love my silver steppers.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.869
And they don't think of me
as one half of Liv and Maddie.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.439
I'm just me, Maddie.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.841
Although they do keep
calling me Addie,

04:02.843 --> 04:05.143
but, you know,
you can't have everything.

04:07.213 --> 04:08.513
Maddie, hi.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.515
Who's Maddie?

04:11.884 --> 04:13.919
Liv, what are you doing here?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.921
I've decided to ditch
the ditch.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.956
I didn't even know
that was gonna

04:17.958 --> 04:20.192
come out of my mouth
until I said it.
( Laughs )

04:20.194 --> 04:22.427
Oh, I'm adorable.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.330
Anyway, I'm looking
for a new community
service idea.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.132
And I thought...

04:27.134 --> 04:28.433
Uh, you can't volunteer here!

04:29.902 --> 04:33.338
I already checked.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.474
There is a waiting list...

04:35.476 --> 04:38.543
For volunteers.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.481
You should check with mom.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.318
She will reassign you.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.788
I so wish that we could
do this together, you know?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.857
I just... we can't.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.558
It's such a bummer.
It's so sad.

04:55.328 --> 04:58.397
Next station!
( Blows whistle )

04:58.399 --> 05:00.932
The truth was I couldn't
figure out a nice way

05:00.934 --> 05:02.968
to tell my sister
that I needed space,

05:02.970 --> 05:07.506
so technically I was
lying right to her face,
which is also my face.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.442
So really I was
just lying to myself,
which makes it okay.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.344
Right?

05:17.850 --> 05:19.584
Check it out.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.553
The fire magic
smokehouse deluxe

05:21.555 --> 05:23.455
is ready for action.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.458
Complete
with thumbprint
ignition pad.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.926
( Beeps )

05:27.928 --> 05:30.295
Only I can use it.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.597
Well, then I must have
one of those on the stove,

05:32.599 --> 05:35.000
the dishwasher,
the dryer, the iron,
the vacuum,

05:35.002 --> 05:37.002
and the toilet handle
after Parker uses it.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.837
<i>Sorry sorry.</i>

05:38.839 --> 05:41.840
That's some grill.
Please tell me more.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.476
( Sighs ) My scooter broke.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.311
It was the weirdest thing.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.447
Me and Cooper and Isaac,

05:48.449 --> 05:50.549
and caulden and Jack and Richie

05:50.551 --> 05:52.884
and Stevie and Evan
were riding on it

05:52.886 --> 05:54.086
and it just snapped!

05:55.388 --> 05:57.356
This piece of junk!

05:57.358 --> 06:00.258
Eight people on a scooter?
What were you thinking?

06:00.260 --> 06:02.427
We were going
for the world record.

06:02.429 --> 06:05.330
Didn't think it would snap
till we added big Wayne.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.233
So can you glue it
back together?

06:08.235 --> 06:10.402
I'm sorry, buddy.
They haven't invented a glue

06:10.404 --> 06:12.070
strong enough to fix that.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.573
Correction, they haven't
invented it yet.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.008
To my laboratory!

06:20.179 --> 06:22.881
Look, dudes, just make sure
nothing happens to Paulie,
all right?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.483
- He's our good-luck charm.
- I'll crush anyone who
comes near him.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.287
Okay, Joey,

06:29.289 --> 06:31.957
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,
but I think you're the muscle.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.527
I was the muscle,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.429
which comes with great
responsibility.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.331
At least I think it does.
I don't really know.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.233
I've never been
the muscle before.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.436
Joey, thanks
for hooking me up
with this job.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.471
This is gonna be so much fun.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.240
Fun?

06:48.242 --> 06:51.376
Fun?
Skippy, this is serious work.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.944
Have you looked around?

06:52.946 --> 06:55.280
We can't secure this porcupine.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.349
I did a quick 360

06:57.351 --> 06:59.484
and there are 47
points of entry...

06:59.486 --> 07:03.488
48 if these tiger sharks can
tunnel up through the floor.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.424
This is... this is so bad.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.392
We'll be the freshman
that let Paulie

07:07.394 --> 07:09.494
fall into enemy hands.
What are we going to do?!

07:09.496 --> 07:12.030
We can't wait
for them to come to us.
We need a new plan!

07:12.032 --> 07:14.566
Okay, give me second.
I'm... I'm thinking.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.969
Don't look me in the eye
when I'm thinking.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.638
It makes me uncomfortable.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.310
Good practice, guys.
Catch you later.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.612
Hey, I'm gonna go sneak up
on our Paulie protectors,

07:27.614 --> 07:30.515
give them a good scare
and listen to them scream
like little girls.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.218
- ( Mimics scream )
- ( Chuckling )

07:33.220 --> 07:35.253
See you.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.459
Shark attack!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.496
( High-pitched scream )

07:46.856 --> 07:47.467
Four more.

07:47.468 --> 07:52.471
Three, two, one,
and take a break.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.605
Don't need a break.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.707
Thanks to you
and my titanium hips,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.476
I'm practically bionic.

07:57.478 --> 08:01.279
Okay well, let's not
exaggerate things, budge.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.281
You did need me
to unscrew your
water bottle.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.349
Ah, no.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.418
I can do that myself.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.420
But you could use the exercise.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.723
I'm looking out for you, hon.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.493
You're the best thing
to hit the wrinkle ranch

08:14.495 --> 08:16.728
since ralphie showed up
in short shorts.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.566
¶ Cha cha cha cha cha, hey ¶

08:21.568 --> 08:23.335
¶ cha cha cha cha cha, hey ¶

08:23.337 --> 08:25.070
¶ cha cha cha cha cha, hey ¶

08:25.072 --> 08:26.505
¶ cha cha cha cha cha, hey ¶

08:26.507 --> 08:28.406
¶ cha cha cha cha cha, hey ¶

08:28.408 --> 08:30.375
¶ cha cha cha
cha cha, hey. ¶

08:30.377 --> 08:31.409
Liv:
<i>Okay, everyone,</i>

08:31.411 --> 08:33.111
big finish.
Big finish.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.746
Jazz hands!

08:36.716 --> 08:38.250
Surprisies.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.552
Liv, what are you doing here?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.454
I'm teaching show choir.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.022
I stopped off at the office.
It turns out that

08:44.024 --> 08:45.657
they do have more room
for volunteers.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.593
So say hello
to the golden chords.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.561
¶ Hello

08:49.563 --> 08:50.629
¶ hello

08:50.631 --> 08:54.332
- ¶ hello
- ¶ Hello

08:54.334 --> 08:58.503
¶ hello-ooo.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.506
Hello.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.609
Am I seeing double
or did I lose a contact?

09:04.611 --> 09:07.679
Baxter fontanel, charmed.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.782
Baxter, could you put
the piano in the corner?

09:10.784 --> 09:14.686
Send the 70-year-old man
with a cane to move the piano.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.089
Um... wait.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.592
Liv, you're gonna
practice in here?
This is my room.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.661
Yeah, but all
the other rooms
are booked.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.529
Plus I thought it
would be fun to share.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.566
You know, just another
twinsie thing that
we can do together.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.401
How do you tell
your best friend

09:29.403 --> 09:31.436
to go back to the ditch
she came from?

09:31.438 --> 09:32.837
You look her right in the eye

09:32.839 --> 09:36.474
and you lay down
the cold, hard truth.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.444
( Strained )
I am so glad you're here.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.147
( Strained ) Jazz hands.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.548
Jazz hands!

09:49.488 --> 09:51.323
Getting Paulie
out of the school hallway

09:51.325 --> 09:53.158
was a stroke of pure genius.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.727
But are you sure this
is the best hiding spot?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.762
Absolutely.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.336
He'll be safe until tomorrow.

10:04.338 --> 10:08.340
a giant porcupine swinging
from your oak tree?

10:08.342 --> 10:11.409
Everyone's got their nose
in their phone nowadays.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.111
Nobody looks up.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.214
( Laughs )

10:16.216 --> 10:18.416
Oh, sorry.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.552
I didn't see you there.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.354
I was looking
at a kitten video.

10:22.356 --> 10:23.555
You should have known
you weren't big enough

10:23.557 --> 10:25.590
to jump over that baby gate.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.594
Joey, I need answers from you.
I need them now.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.498
Bratwurst or pork burgers
for the barbecue this weekend?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.434
I know I'm asking early,
but I hate

10:36.436 --> 10:38.303
to have things hanging
over my head.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.307
Well, dad,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.442
pick a dead animal
and I'll eat it.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.844
My man!

10:45.846 --> 10:47.746
Does it look like rain?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.414
<i>Oh, that's a good question.</i>

10:49.416 --> 10:50.849
I'll check my phone.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.688
Huh? I'm sorry,
wait, what's that?

10:56.690 --> 10:59.624
Who's the Paulie protector?
This guy!

11:02.328 --> 11:03.528
Oh, it'll be awesome

11:03.530 --> 11:05.630
hanging that first
bratwurst on Paulie.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.532
Everyone'll be clapping.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.834
Just when they think
we can't get any cooler...

11:11.470 --> 11:12.937
Boo-yah!

11:14.240 --> 11:15.440
Oh, it's perfect.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.574
Just remember to stay
on my left.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.410
We want to be boo-yah.

11:18.412 --> 11:20.612
Yah-boo is just stupid.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.487
How's it going
with the glue, Professor?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.423
Uh, did people ask Einstein

11:31.425 --> 11:33.525
"how's it going"
while he was splitting atoms?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.760
Uh...

11:35.762 --> 11:38.196
Einstein didn't split atoms.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.398
Maybe that's because
people kept interrupting him.

11:44.937 --> 11:48.940
And now the moment of truth.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.947
Yes, it worked!

11:58.818 --> 12:00.618
This is amazing.

12:01.976 --> 12:03.322
Well, it's impressive,

12:03.323 --> 12:07.325
but how are you gonna get
my good pan off the fridge?

12:07.327 --> 12:12.397
Mom, a simple
"Parker, you're a genius"
will do.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.737

Wait, I need that.

13:02.081 --> 13:05.550
Liv, this just is not
gonna work for me, okay?

13:05.552 --> 13:08.620
You've got us packed
over here tighter than
budge's workout pants.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.656
If you got it,
flaunt it, honey.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.527
If you got it,
I've never seen it.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.564
This is my room
and I call dibs.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.432
( Laughs ) Dibs?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.768
Really?
What, are we a couple
of first graders?

13:23.770 --> 13:26.004
Are we gonna settle this
with a game of dodgeball?

13:26.006 --> 13:28.406
Winner's gonna get the room?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.575
( Squeals )

13:30.577 --> 13:33.478
Nice shot, budge.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.050
Should have stuck
with shuffleboard, granny,

13:39.052 --> 13:41.052
'cause this game's gonna hurt.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.560
What is wrong with you two?!

13:48.562 --> 13:50.829
- What's wrong?
- Did you see sharks?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.698
No, but I'll tell you
what I did see,

13:53.700 --> 13:56.568
a giant bronze porcupine statue

13:56.570 --> 13:57.569
swinging from the tree

13:57.571 --> 13:59.404
when I was three blocks away!

13:59.406 --> 14:02.407
Okay.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.509
That is a problem,
but you have to admit

14:04.511 --> 14:06.477
when you're standing
right here,

14:06.479 --> 14:07.879
you don't see it at all.

14:07.881 --> 14:11.516
We have to get him back.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.085
If people
find out you took him,
you'll be outcasts.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.820
I'll be the doofus
who picked the outcasts

14:15.822 --> 14:17.822
and I'm <i>not </i> gonna
be diggie the doofus!

14:19.358 --> 14:21.593
Okay okay.
Let's get him down.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.362
Oh yeah,
take your time, Joey.
( Shouts ) Go!

14:24.364 --> 14:27.632
You two get under Paulie.
I'm going to let him
down gently.

14:29.501 --> 14:32.437
( Strains )
Stupid thing is stuck.

My lemonade!

14:48.888 --> 14:50.889
I fixed my scooter, losers!

14:50.891 --> 14:53.591
Parker, beat it.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.560
We have to figure...
wait a second.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.629
How'd you get your scooter
back together?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.464
Oh, my new invention.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.734
Parker paste,
patent pending.
Sticks to anything.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.602
I just glued dad's
toilet seat shut,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.537
so after dinner,
get ready for the show.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.576
Parker, your paste
might be the only thing

15:11.578 --> 15:13.411
that could get me
out of this jam.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.446
<i>Well, I beg of you.</i>

15:15.448 --> 15:18.416
As your brother,
Parker, please...

15:18.418 --> 15:20.051
Give me some glue.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.853
I think what we have here

15:21.855 --> 15:24.155
is what you call
a "swap-portunity."

15:25.724 --> 15:27.558
Ahhh!

15:28.994 --> 15:32.463
Pleasure doing business
with you, butt bags.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.467
Diggie, you're better
than this.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.573
Ahh!

15:44.443 --> 15:47.078
This is no holds-barred
dodgeball.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.579
Winner takes the room.
Loser takes...

15:48.581 --> 15:50.181
who cares.
You're the loser.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.954
You sure you want
to do this, songbird?

15:55.956 --> 15:59.590
Jazz hands can't save you now.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.793
Oh, I'm sure.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.495
That ditch put
ice in my veins...

16:05.230 --> 16:07.198
And a rash on my ankle.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.293
Changed my mind.
The room is all yours.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.028
See ya.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.702
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

17:51.704 --> 17:53.271
to have to pick up
your daughters

17:53.273 --> 17:55.239
because they started
a dodgeball riot

17:55.241 --> 17:57.642
at the senior center?

17:57.644 --> 18:00.244
No, you don't because
it's never happened before

18:00.246 --> 18:02.914
in the history of the world.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.819
High marks for originality,
what what?

18:11.790 --> 18:14.959
Because of you
the senior center will
no longer allow

18:14.961 --> 18:17.195
my ridgewood students
to volunteer.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.930
Mom, we're really sorry.
We messed up.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.065
Yeah, and we swear
if we could fix it,
we would.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.733
Funny you should mention that

18:22.735 --> 18:25.603
because I just happen
to have two openings.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.338
( Gasps ) Not the ditch!

18:27.340 --> 18:30.108
I signed you both up
for double the hours.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.876
Report to mile marker 35,

18:31.878 --> 18:33.978

and the sewage plant.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.315
Uh, what what?

18:40.786 --> 18:43.354
- Dibs on the cow farm side.
- Ha.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.690
Cute that you think
that there's a good side.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.627
What happened back there?

18:50.273 --> 18:50.762
I just...

18:50.763 --> 18:53.731
the senior center
is just kind of my hang

18:53.733 --> 18:56.300
and you sort of
space invaded it.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.202
Got it.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.271
Oh hey, here's an idea.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.341
Next time you have
a problem, tell me <i>before</i>
<i>the over-80 crowd</i>
