is to see us dead.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.492
Why?

51:30.213 --> 51:31.749
ERIC:
He pissed me off.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.626
Then I pissed him off.

51:35.343 --> 51:38.801
-You know how these things go.
-No, I don't.

51:38.972 --> 51:42.089
Why would you keep Russell Edgington
alive?

51:42.642 --> 51:45.600
After what he did, we felt that true death
was too good for him.

51:45.770 --> 51:47.306
We wanted him to suffer.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.267
You wanted.

51:50.441 --> 51:55.481
You disobeyed the Authority
to satisfy your feelings.

51:56.572 --> 52:01.066
| feel like staking you so fucking much
right now.

52:01.244 --> 52:03.986
Guardian. I was the one that did it.

52:05.707 --> 52:08.244
You were king and you allowed him?

52:09.168 --> 52:11.580
Lilith help me, I am going to stake you.

52:21.472 --> 52:24.259
Unfortunately...

52:24.434 --> 52:27.050
...unlike the two of you...

52:28.146 --> 52:31.980
...I understand there are
a great many things more important...

52:33.860 --> 52:35.725
...than my personal desires.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.149
BILL:
Guardian, I promise you.

52:42.535 --> 52:46.198
Now Russell is free.
He will stop at nothing to find us.

52:46.372 --> 52:48.408
And when he does you will be there.

52:48.583 --> 52:51.290
To put an end to him
as we should have.

52:51.461 --> 52:55.170
I offer this to you
as a final gesture of solidarity.

52:55.715 --> 53:00.379
I, like you, believe that mainstreaming
is possible. And essential.

53:01.220 --> 53:03.302
But Russell must be stopped.

53:07.143 --> 53:10.635
I fully expect to meet the true death
either way.

53:18.988 --> 53:21.525
