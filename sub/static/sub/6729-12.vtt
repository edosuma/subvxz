01:36.649 --> 01:37.775
I did it.

01:38.818 --> 01:39.902
I did everything he said.

01:40.653 --> 01:44.198
What exactly did he tell you to do?
What were his exact words?

01:45.157 --> 01:48.368
His words, Luke. Repeat his words.

01:48.453 --> 01:50.705
"Blow up your bar with you in it.

01:50.788 --> 01:52.206
Make sure Jessica sees it."

01:54.124 --> 01:58.963
He didn't tell you to kill yourself,
or "kill Jessica," or anything else?

02:00.798 --> 02:03.509
<i>Two days ago, I
followed you to a restaurant.</i>

02:03.593 --> 02:06.596
<i>You didn't come out, but he did.</i>

02:12.392 --> 02:13.686
Stop!

02:13.769 --> 02:16.146
- Who the hell are you?
- Luke Cage.

02:16.230 --> 02:17.482
Tell me what you want.

02:18.065 --> 02:19.817
- Quickly!
- To kill you.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.319
Well, take a bloody number. Did
Jessica tell you to do this?

02:22.402 --> 02:25.740
No. I followed her here, thought
she might lead me to you.

02:25.823 --> 02:28.451
Oh, great. Just great.
Get in the sodding car.

02:29.201 --> 02:30.453
Go on.

02:39.253 --> 02:41.338
I didn't kill your silly wife.
Jessica did.

02:41.421 --> 02:43.173
All I wanted was Reva's
copy of that video.

02:43.257 --> 02:45.425
What was I supposed to do,
allow someone to expose me?

02:45.510 --> 02:47.845
- Yes.
- Oh, shut up!

02:50.055 --> 02:51.682
How do you know Jessica?

02:53.350 --> 02:54.852
We were lovers.

02:56.353 --> 03:00.107
- What was it, a pity shag?
- No.

03:00.983 --> 03:03.819
There's... something between us.

03:05.154 --> 03:06.614
But she lied to you.

03:06.697 --> 03:08.616
Yes.

03:08.699 --> 03:10.450
Then she told me everything.

03:10.993 --> 03:13.538
Oh, look at that, Dad. Jessica
being honest with someone.

03:16.165 --> 03:18.626
Tell me the truth, did you
bugger my chances with her?

03:18.709 --> 03:20.044
No.

03:21.295 --> 03:23.172
You screwed that up yourself.

03:27.593 --> 03:30.054
I'll have to think of a
fitting response to that.

03:47.279 --> 03:48.405
You're done.

03:49.406 --> 03:51.116
- It's over.
- Over?

03:52.117 --> 03:54.829
The only thing I had left of Reva
was inside those four walls.

03:57.456 --> 03:58.791
I'm sorry.

04:01.126 --> 04:03.128
Does Kilgrave know about your skin?

04:04.254 --> 04:07.341
No. It's not the kind of
thing people think to ask.

04:07.424 --> 04:08.759
Good. He thinks you're dead.

04:10.678 --> 04:12.471
Do you know where he is now?

04:12.555 --> 04:13.931
I can't be here.

04:14.557 --> 04:17.226
They're gonna want to question you.
Your bar just blew up.

04:17.309 --> 04:18.435
Not mine.

04:18.517 --> 04:21.647
Reva made sure my name wasn't
anywhere on that paperwork.

04:21.731 --> 04:23.232
Where are you going?

04:24.233 --> 04:25.484
I don't know.

04:29.614 --> 04:32.324
All right. Let's go.

04:55.723 --> 04:57.516
Sorry about the mess.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.184
At least it's not on fire.

04:59.268 --> 05:00.811
Guess we're
both lousy renters.

05:03.355 --> 05:05.357
- Do I need to know what happened here?
- Nope.

05:17.536 --> 05:18.913
I was a fool.

05:19.955 --> 05:21.290
I didn't believe you about him.

05:22.249 --> 05:23.417
Not enough.

05:27.462 --> 05:29.589
I wasn't trustworthy.

05:29.674 --> 05:31.466
Doesn't make you a fool.

05:32.802 --> 05:34.804
Trying to catch him does.

05:46.774 --> 05:48.025
When I, uh...

05:52.112 --> 05:53.447
When he made me...

05:56.575 --> 05:57.868
kill Reva...

06:00.037 --> 06:01.747
I didn't realize it at the time,

06:01.831 --> 06:04.374
but I think it severed
the hold he had on me.

06:08.045 --> 06:09.546
He can't control me.

06:10.798 --> 06:12.216
Not anymore.

06:15.260 --> 06:18.723
You're free of him... because of Reva?

06:21.308 --> 06:22.601
Maybe.

06:25.020 --> 06:27.397
So, because you didn't
want to kill her...

06:29.649 --> 06:32.611
you were able to push him out.

06:35.405 --> 06:37.992
He could've told you to blow
me up along with the bar.

06:40.369 --> 06:42.662
But he wanted you hurt, not dead.

06:42.747 --> 06:44.706
Not yet, anyway.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.083
But you can kill him.

06:48.418 --> 06:49.879
That's my plan.

06:51.671 --> 06:53.382
I'm gonna help.

06:53.465 --> 06:56.676
That depends on how long it's
been since you've seen him.

06:56.761 --> 06:59.513
- How many hours?
- Six, maybe seven.

06:59.596 --> 07:01.556
You need to hit the 12-hour
mark with no Kilgrave.

07:02.933 --> 07:05.394
Take the bed.

07:05.477 --> 07:07.021
I'm good here, you take it.

07:07.104 --> 07:09.982
I don't plan on sleeping. I
have a police scanner app.

07:10.065 --> 07:11.316
Kilgrave leaves a trail.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.944
And you want to keep an eye on me.

07:14.028 --> 07:17.531
Just in case you've been ordered to do
something that I didn't think to ask.

07:18.698 --> 07:20.659
I'll take the bed.

08:11.293 --> 08:13.212
A hundred feet. You
call that improvement?

08:13.295 --> 08:15.214
That's up from 80.

08:15.297 --> 08:17.299
The changes are incremental,
not exponential...

08:17.382 --> 08:20.302
I haven't got time for incremental, Dad.
Jessica is trying to kill me now.

08:20.385 --> 08:24.014
Well, we won't know if you can
control Jessica without Jessica.

08:24.098 --> 08:27.351
- All we can test for is time and distance.
- Well, my distance is piss-all.

08:27.434 --> 08:30.229
- You hear the hecklers in the back row?
- "Get off the stage, asshole."

08:30.312 --> 08:32.022
I didn't ask you to recount it.

08:32.106 --> 08:34.024
Yo, you crushed it in there, man.
That was like anti-rock...

08:34.107 --> 08:35.150
Stop talking.

08:35.692 --> 08:36.775
Dad, tell me.

08:36.861 --> 08:39.279
Are you doing everything
that you possibly can?

08:39.363 --> 08:40.614
Yes.

08:40.697 --> 08:42.157
Shit.

08:46.536 --> 08:48.497
Cross the street, face that
fence, and stay there forever.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.209
Kevin, be reasonable.

08:52.292 --> 08:54.378
Well, it won't
actually be forever,

08:54.461 --> 08:57.131
because it's incremental,
not exponential, remember?

08:57.214 --> 08:58.548
Come on, you've got work to do.

09:13.397 --> 09:14.773
They're releasing you?

09:14.857 --> 09:16.733
<i>They were just
keeping me for observation.</i>

09:16.816 --> 09:18.568
<i>So, how can I help you?</i>

09:18.652 --> 09:20.863
- Rest.
<i>- And?</i>

09:20.946 --> 09:23.407
You can triple down on
your home security system.

09:24.366 --> 09:25.742
Somebody already got in.

09:26.535 --> 09:27.661
<i>The two dead guys are gone.</i>

09:27.744 --> 09:30.497
My doorman said somebody
cleaned the whole place up.

09:30.580 --> 09:34.293
<i>Wish they would've done that over here.
They just took Simpson and left.</i>

09:36.086 --> 09:37.379
Do you think he's still alive?

09:39.006 --> 09:40.257
I don't know.

09:40.340 --> 09:42.509
He was a good guy.

09:42.592 --> 09:43.593
No, he wasn't.

09:43.677 --> 09:45.971
<i>He was, before those drugs
turned him into Godzilla.</i>

09:46.763 --> 09:49.558
Listen, I've been asking around here.

09:50.642 --> 09:55.147
Simpson's doctor works for a private
research corporation called IGH.

09:55.230 --> 09:57.107
<i>Which is an acronym for nothing.</i>

09:57.191 --> 09:58.692
It doesn't exist.

09:58.775 --> 10:01.904
No web page, no contact
number, nothing.

10:01.987 --> 10:06.200
Please, Trish. I can only
fight one Big Bad at a time.

10:06.283 --> 10:08.077
<i>Of course, let's get Kilgrave first.</i>

10:09.078 --> 10:10.412
Okay, I'll keep you posted.

10:10.495 --> 10:12.622
Sounds good. Bye.

10:21.215 --> 10:22.507
Simpson?

10:24.927 --> 10:26.428
Who's out there?

10:29.139 --> 10:32.517
Sorry. You were on the phone.
I didn't want to barge in.

10:34.269 --> 10:35.604
Just eavesdrop.

10:35.687 --> 10:39.524
Okay. Off to a great start.

10:44.529 --> 10:47.032
Jesus, who sent carnations?

10:48.658 --> 10:51.078
- What are you doing here, Mother?
- Well, I was worried.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.330
You've never missed a show.

10:53.413 --> 10:55.665
So when <i>Trish Talk</i> got
preempted this morning, I...

10:55.749 --> 10:58.127
- You listen to my show?
- Well, of course.

10:58.210 --> 11:01.421
I'm afraid I berated your station
manager into telling me where you were.

11:02.131 --> 11:03.715
You're good at verbal abuse.

11:05.134 --> 11:07.552
The nurse told me you took something.

11:07.636 --> 11:08.887
I'm fine.

11:08.971 --> 11:10.347
Hmm?

11:11.390 --> 11:13.725
I didn't relapse. I'm fine.

11:15.810 --> 11:17.312
Good.

11:17.396 --> 11:18.730
That's good.

11:19.398 --> 11:23.068
You know, I would listen to <i>Trish
Talk</i> even if you weren't my daughter.

11:23.152 --> 11:25.237
You're so smart, incisive...

11:25.320 --> 11:28.698
- I don't need your approval, Mother.
- Well, tough shit. You got it.

11:34.704 --> 11:36.748
People still look up to you.

11:36.831 --> 11:39.376
I get calls about you all the time.

11:39.459 --> 11:40.752
I'm not your client.

11:40.835 --> 11:45.507
As you made abundantly clear years
ago, to me, privately, publicly,

11:45.590 --> 11:46.800
internationally...

11:46.883 --> 11:50.262
I didn't want you getting your
claws into another starlet.

11:51.346 --> 11:52.681
Fair enough.

11:54.141 --> 11:56.643
I was a god-awful mother back then.

11:56.726 --> 11:58.353
And not now?

11:58.437 --> 12:00.064
How would I know?

12:02.399 --> 12:04.443
You never gave me another shot at it.

12:07.821 --> 12:09.489
I'd like you to leave now.

12:12.076 --> 12:13.285
Fine.

12:15.745 --> 12:19.166
I'll just... scream at some
nurses on the way out,

12:19.249 --> 12:20.584
to lift my spirits.

12:27.424 --> 12:29.634
You can help yourself to...

12:30.260 --> 12:32.053
Well, there's nothing.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.849
There's a decent pizza
joint on the corner.

12:35.932 --> 12:38.643
- You got a lead?
- A theory.

12:38.727 --> 12:40.479
You said 12 hours. It's been 14.

12:40.562 --> 12:43.148
- His control is over.
- Unless you run into him.

12:44.733 --> 12:46.693
Trust me.

12:46.776 --> 12:48.945
We get close, I'm out of there.

12:49.028 --> 12:52.532
I got no interest in
being used by him again.

12:52.616 --> 12:54.493
You could walk away right now,

12:54.576 --> 12:57.287
find another bar, a new place to live.

12:57.371 --> 13:00.249
This could all be over for you.

13:00.332 --> 13:02.376
That who you think I am?

13:02.459 --> 13:05.504
I think you're someone
who's trying to survive...

13:08.757 --> 13:13.470
who keeps hidden what he needs to hide,
and I don't need to know what that is.

13:15.054 --> 13:18.642
But going after Kilgrave, there's...
no hiding there.

13:20.644 --> 13:24.523
I want him dead... same as you.

13:24.606 --> 13:26.065
Until that happens...

13:27.025 --> 13:28.485
I'm with you.

13:47.754 --> 13:49.047
{an8}So what's your theory?

13:49.130 --> 13:51.841
He's trying to increase
his power so he can control me.

13:51.925 --> 13:53.177
So, how does he get it?

13:53.260 --> 13:55.970
I don't know, but he's keeping
his dad alive for some reason.

13:56.054 --> 13:58.765
Maybe Kilgrave thinks Albert can
improve upon his original work.

13:58.848 --> 14:01.226
You can't improve on an
asshole by making it bigger.

14:03.353 --> 14:06.064
- Hey, where you going?
- Away from you.

14:06.147 --> 14:07.399
Hey, man, take it easy.

14:07.482 --> 14:09.025
I'm speaking truth, man.

14:09.108 --> 14:11.195
- It's okay, he's been through a lot.
- Yeah, we all have.

14:12.070 --> 14:15.824
Don't talk about me in the third person.
I'm standing right in front of you.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.868
I'm going home, Jessica.

14:19.953 --> 14:22.622
- I'm glad.
- No, you're relieved.

14:22.706 --> 14:25.792
I could have died with my parents
still thinking that I was

14:25.875 --> 14:28.044
all the things that he made me.

14:28.127 --> 14:30.505
I broke their hearts,
but you know what?

14:30.589 --> 14:32.841
I'd rather face their pain and anger

14:32.924 --> 14:35.594
than this loneliness
that I feel around you.

14:53.195 --> 14:57.073
It's a long shot, but this
is where I found Albert last time.

15:02.371 --> 15:04.289
Rough life, hiding from
your homicidal son.

15:04.373 --> 15:07.501
I doubt Kilgrave let him come
back for clean underwear.

15:07.584 --> 15:09.586
We're looking for
something in particular?

15:09.669 --> 15:11.755
Nope. That's how we find something.

15:13.507 --> 15:15.342
What the hell are you doing in here?

15:15.425 --> 15:18.428
You want a room, go to the front desk.
This ain't an open house.

15:18.512 --> 15:21.097
You rented this room
to Albert Thompson.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.558
- He's gone.
- We're just here to pick up his stuff.

15:23.642 --> 15:26.270
He stiffed me on the bill.
You gonna pick that up, too?

15:28.062 --> 15:30.232
We'll just take what we
need and be on our way.

15:30.315 --> 15:33.109
Don't belong to you. I sold it all.

15:33.192 --> 15:37.196
Lab equipment's very popular on eBay.
Lots of thrifty meth cooks out there.

15:37.281 --> 15:39.533
So, unless you wanna help
me pack this shit up...

15:41.368 --> 15:43.495
We could just kick her ass.
Would that be wrong?

15:43.578 --> 15:45.079
Tough call.

15:45.163 --> 15:47.957
It's too bad them chemicals he had
don't have any recreational use.

15:48.041 --> 15:49.709
- Chemicals?
- Those boxes.

15:49.793 --> 15:51.044
Shit weighs a ton.

15:52.962 --> 15:54.047
Fifty bucks.

15:54.130 --> 15:55.882
You just said they were worthless.

15:55.965 --> 15:57.467
Worth somethin' to you.

16:03.473 --> 16:04.933
Whoa, whoa!

16:06.685 --> 16:08.478
Nah, just the basics.

16:08.562 --> 16:11.648
Saline, boric acid, rubbing alcohol...

16:13.775 --> 16:17.404
And something... unpronounceable.

16:17.487 --> 16:19.281
It's an adeno-associated
viral compound.

16:19.364 --> 16:21.408
It's used for genetic brain disorders.

16:22.075 --> 16:25.036
I looked it up. It's expensive shit.
Hard to come by.

16:25.119 --> 16:26.288
You know who wants to buy it?

16:26.371 --> 16:27.831
No one.

16:27.914 --> 16:31.751
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.
It's a local bio-chem lab.

16:32.294 --> 16:34.421
Hmm. Worth a look-see.

16:40.093 --> 16:41.595
I don't know anything.

16:43.763 --> 16:45.014
Please.

17:00.572 --> 17:02.366
- He was here?
- Twice.

17:02.449 --> 17:05.284
Cleaned them out of that AAV1 shit.

17:05.368 --> 17:06.953
He's coming back for more.

17:07.036 --> 17:09.455
Is that why that guy was in such
a hurry to get back to work?

17:09.539 --> 17:14.002
When Kilgrave tells you to work
nonstop, you literally work nonstop.

17:14.085 --> 17:17.255
Place smelled like piss and shit.
Couple of them had fainted.

17:17.339 --> 17:19.799
Shit.

17:19.883 --> 17:21.968
Hey, all we can do is wait, okay?

17:34.648 --> 17:36.065
They say that...

17:37.066 --> 17:40.445
talking about a trauma...

17:42.364 --> 17:43.865
that it helps.

17:45.492 --> 17:48.453
That and jogging. Two things
that make me feel like crap.

17:59.255 --> 18:02.175
I stood there at the bar, waiting...

18:04.260 --> 18:06.596
smelling the gas, thinking...

18:07.931 --> 18:09.516
"Put down the lighter.

18:12.351 --> 18:15.980
Walk out before you destroy
everything you and Reva worked for."

18:18.733 --> 18:20.527
But I couldn't do it.

18:27.241 --> 18:28.702
I was wrong...

18:29.994 --> 18:32.080
for blaming Reva's murder on you.

18:33.206 --> 18:34.624
For calling you a...

18:36.710 --> 18:38.545
What I called you.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.298
It's okay.

18:42.381 --> 18:44.593
I got no right to offer this, but...

18:44.676 --> 18:46.511
Don't apologize. I don't
want that from you.

18:52.183 --> 18:53.935
How 'bout...

18:56.187 --> 18:57.689
I forgive you...

18:59.524 --> 19:01.025
for everything.

19:03.612 --> 19:07.657
And I'll say it every day for
as long as you need to hear it.

19:37.687 --> 19:40.815
- Did you see a doorman out there?
- I did.

19:40.899 --> 19:44.986
He said you have imaginary
dead bodies in your apartment?

19:45.069 --> 19:47.113
He drinks.

19:47.196 --> 19:48.281
Ah.

19:48.364 --> 19:50.241
Well, I have something for you.

19:58.124 --> 19:59.751
Damn it.

20:12.972 --> 20:14.098
Oh!

20:15.016 --> 20:18.269
You always did have good taste.

20:18.352 --> 20:20.438
Expensive, but good.

20:23.024 --> 20:24.609
Where'd you get it?

20:24.693 --> 20:27.946
- Oh, no foreplay, huh?
- Ugh, Jesus, Mother.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.535
You know, I really wasn't eavesdropping
when I saw you this morning,

20:33.618 --> 20:35.745
until I heard you say "IGH."

20:36.412 --> 20:38.832
You know how I always
keep meticulous files,

20:38.915 --> 20:41.125
and never throw anything away.

20:41.209 --> 20:43.377
In case you have to use it
against somebody later.

20:43.461 --> 20:44.462
Ha!

20:47.549 --> 20:49.092
Here.

20:53.888 --> 20:56.265
- You want something.
- You're right.

20:56.349 --> 20:59.518
I want a relationship with my daughter.

20:59.603 --> 21:01.771
Any relationship.

21:01.855 --> 21:05.692
And this is me trying to
earn back your trust.

21:06.317 --> 21:07.861
I should have shared
it earlier, I know,

21:07.944 --> 21:10.113
but you and Jessie were just so young.

21:10.196 --> 21:12.448
- Jess?
- Yeah.

21:20.206 --> 21:21.791
Jess' medical bills.

21:21.875 --> 21:25.169
From her accident. Came with
her files when I adopted her.

21:25.253 --> 21:27.130
Check out who paid them.

21:31.259 --> 21:33.720
I figured it was a charitable
write-off for them.

21:37.098 --> 21:38.975
Did they know about her abilities?

21:39.058 --> 21:41.394
- Did you tell them?
- God, no!

21:41.477 --> 21:43.146
Jessie threatened to, quote,

21:43.229 --> 21:47.776
"tie my earlobes to my brain" if
I ever said anything to anyone.

21:47.859 --> 21:49.694
And that threat still
stands, by the way.

21:49.778 --> 21:52.781
And you never thought to ask
if they did something to her?

21:52.864 --> 21:55.617
Why would I? It was already done.

22:01.122 --> 22:02.581
There may be more.

22:05.710 --> 22:09.588
You're welcome to come home
and go through all my files.

22:11.507 --> 22:14.260
It's not home for me anymore.

22:14.343 --> 22:16.304
Well, it is as far as I'm concerned.

22:18.431 --> 22:21.726
And besides, everyone
would love to see you.

22:21.810 --> 22:24.645
Remember Sabrina? She
just asked about you.

22:24.729 --> 22:30.068
In fact, she's looking for someone to
endorse her bottled water division.

22:31.820 --> 22:37.283
And for every bottle sold, they
give water to places that need it.

22:37.366 --> 22:38.534
One for one.

22:39.202 --> 22:41.454
I'd forgot how good you were.

22:42.956 --> 22:46.459
You also forget that one-room
apartment we used to live in.

22:46.542 --> 22:48.419
You don't piss on money, Pats.

22:48.502 --> 22:50.755
It's an insult to those
of us who had none.

22:54.258 --> 22:57.303
Thank you for the information.
I'd like you to go now.

23:10.524 --> 23:12.485
The files will still
be waiting for you.

23:35.508 --> 23:37.927
Someone's coming.

23:38.011 --> 23:39.470
Damn it.

23:39.553 --> 23:40.930
That's not Kilgrave.

23:41.014 --> 23:42.390
No one's been in or out all day.

23:42.473 --> 23:45.059
Then we follow this guy. Good
chance he's our courier.

24:31.147 --> 24:32.523
Kilgrave could be in there.

24:37.695 --> 24:39.405
Do what you gotta do.

25:12.521 --> 25:14.107
That is not cool.

25:45.013 --> 25:46.347
Breeders.

26:17.795 --> 26:20.339
Hey! Stop! Stop!

26:20.839 --> 26:23.092
Hey! Hey, you can't take those!

26:25.886 --> 26:27.513
- No!
- Oh, Jesus!

27:12.016 --> 27:14.810
I'm gonna go find a cop.
Someone call 911.

27:26.697 --> 27:29.825
Kilgrave still needs the chemicals.

27:29.908 --> 27:31.660
Means his dad hasn't
cracked the upgrade yet.

27:31.744 --> 27:33.371
Well, it's a matter of
time before he does,

27:33.454 --> 27:35.289
and that's when the
real shit show starts.

27:35.373 --> 27:38.584
He'll be able to control people
through buildings, walls, the radio.

27:39.252 --> 27:41.462
"Hey, New York, go to the
highest building and jump."

27:41.545 --> 27:43.881
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.

27:53.849 --> 27:54.850
Hey.

27:55.809 --> 27:59.022
What are you doing here?
You should be in bed.

27:59.105 --> 28:01.315
I'm fine. I was just, um...

28:01.399 --> 28:03.067
checking in on your search.

28:03.151 --> 28:06.779
Well, we're screwed and out of leads.
Are you sure that's all?

28:06.862 --> 28:08.072
"We"?

28:09.157 --> 28:10.824
I'm helping her take Kilgrave out.

28:11.742 --> 28:13.369
She usually refuses help.

28:14.287 --> 28:16.164
I'm uniquely qualified.

28:16.247 --> 28:20.043
- Uh, Trish Walker.
- Luke Cage.

28:20.126 --> 28:23.171
- Jess didn't, uh, mention you to me...
- He's a friend.

28:23.254 --> 28:25.464
Who knows about Kilgrave.

28:26.590 --> 28:28.301
I found out the hard way.

28:31.512 --> 28:32.846
I'm sorry.

28:36.475 --> 28:37.893
Can you give us a sec?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.444
My wife was a big fan of your show.

28:47.611 --> 28:50.906
Thank you. It's lovely to meet you.

28:50.989 --> 28:52.200
Likewise.

28:56.954 --> 28:58.247
Okay, his wife?

28:58.331 --> 29:01.584
She's dead... All right, I killed her.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.086
Wait, that's Reva's husband?

29:03.169 --> 29:06.130
- You're sleeping with Reva's husband?
- No, I'm not sleeping with him.

29:06.214 --> 29:07.881
Not anymore.

29:07.965 --> 29:09.925
And what's going on?
What's in your bag?

29:11.009 --> 29:12.053
It can wait.

29:12.136 --> 29:14.472
Clearly not, or you wouldn't have
walked all the way over here.

29:14.555 --> 29:16.432
Look...

29:16.515 --> 29:19.810
it's not gonna change how
you find or kill Kilgrave.

29:19.893 --> 29:21.770
- But it's important.
- Yes, and private.

29:21.854 --> 29:23.272
So if you didn't have company, then...

29:23.356 --> 29:26.317
Ugh! It's not like you're
interrupting some romantic interlude.

29:27.318 --> 29:28.486
Why not?

29:30.154 --> 29:31.489
'Cause people are dying.

29:31.572 --> 29:36.202
Look, he obviously has feelings for you,
and you definitely have feelings for him.

29:36.285 --> 29:37.286
I do not.

29:37.370 --> 29:39.955
Please, the chemistry was
jumping off of the two of you.

29:40.038 --> 29:42.750
And you can't say he's not hot.

29:42.833 --> 29:44.168
Fine, he's hot.

29:44.252 --> 29:46.379
And if Kilgrave weren't
trying to kill me...

29:46.462 --> 29:48.839
You'd push him away
like everybody else.

29:52.135 --> 29:54.345
I can't think about that right now.

29:54.428 --> 29:55.804
Okay.

29:55.888 --> 29:57.723
But just...

29:58.724 --> 30:02.561
When this is over, when
you win this thing, I...

30:03.854 --> 30:06.690
I hope you finally allow
yourself some happiness.

30:16.784 --> 30:18.536
Yeah, man, I'm sorry.

30:19.620 --> 30:20.746
Yeah.

30:20.829 --> 30:22.039
Yeah.

30:31.006 --> 30:32.007
Shit.

30:32.090 --> 30:33.217
Yeah.

30:34.677 --> 30:36.595
Okay, buddy, I'll talk to you later.

30:36.679 --> 30:37.805
Yeah.

30:40.141 --> 30:42.310
Had to tell Roy his
bartending job blew up.

30:42.393 --> 30:44.270
He's gotta find a new gig.

30:44.353 --> 30:45.979
And the hits keep on coming.

30:50.484 --> 30:52.320
He'll be all right.

30:55.489 --> 30:58.701
There's always work
for a good bartender.

31:25.478 --> 31:27.355
This belonged to Reva.

31:29.565 --> 31:34.111
When she told you to dig up that basement,
this is what she wanted you to find.

31:34.987 --> 31:37.030
There's videos on it.

31:37.114 --> 31:39.242
Experiments on kids.

31:39.325 --> 31:40.993
Kilgrave was one of them.

31:43.204 --> 31:45.956
Lot of other files, but
I didn't open them.

31:49.502 --> 31:51.212
It was meant for you.

32:06.810 --> 32:08.271
For security.

32:10.606 --> 32:12.400
To protect me.

32:20.824 --> 32:22.993
Do you mind if I use your shower?

32:24.703 --> 32:26.372
Sure, take your time.

33:01.198 --> 33:03.659
Oh, this is not
your job, spying on people!

33:03.742 --> 33:05.202
Ma'am, nobody
is spying on anyone.

33:05.286 --> 33:06.537
You are spying!

33:06.620 --> 33:08.914
You are spying! You were
going and looking at people!

33:08.997 --> 33:10.499
I'm trying to
find the right apartment.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.584
Shit.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.251
You're not trying to
find the right apartment...

33:13.336 --> 33:15.087
Snap out of it, sister!
Don't let him control you!

33:15.170 --> 33:17.631
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Don't let him control you. Wake up!

33:17.715 --> 33:19.675
- Robyn, stop it! Stop it!
- She is one of Kilgrave's drones.

33:19.758 --> 33:20.759
She is crazy.

33:20.843 --> 33:22.636
She is lurking in the halls
in the dead of night.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.305
It's 6:00! This is my last delivery!

33:24.388 --> 33:27.766
- She was spying on me for Kilgrave.
- I didn't know the apartment number.

33:27.850 --> 33:29.310
- Is there a camera in your little machine?
- Stop it.

33:29.393 --> 33:30.478
- Spill the beans!
- Hey, hey!

33:30.561 --> 33:31.937
Stop it! Just let me see that.

33:32.020 --> 33:33.564
If there is a severed body part

33:33.647 --> 33:34.690
- in that box...
- What?

33:34.773 --> 33:36.650
...of any kind, I'm
going to be very upset.

33:36.734 --> 33:38.444
It's for Ruben.

33:38.527 --> 33:39.987
I'm calling the cops.

33:40.070 --> 33:42.323
No, she's probably just off her meds.

33:42.406 --> 33:44.492
This whack job is dangerous.

33:44.575 --> 33:47.328
- She just lost her brother.
- I didn't lose him.

33:49.121 --> 33:50.247
He's dead.

33:50.956 --> 33:53.041
Please, this won't happen again.

33:54.627 --> 33:56.795
Whack job.

34:14.980 --> 34:18.859
Ruben's chinchilla chewed through
his charger cord two weeks ago.

34:20.402 --> 34:23.237
And I wouldn't let him pay
for express shipping.

34:39.713 --> 34:41.715
Ruben was such a great guy.

34:41.799 --> 34:44.092
He was kind and gentle, and...

34:45.594 --> 34:47.638
I don't know what he put
in that banana bread but,

34:47.721 --> 34:49.556
it was like crack.

34:51.141 --> 34:52.601
Wait, was it crack?

34:54.520 --> 34:55.853
Nutmeg.

35:03.571 --> 35:05.823
I'm no good without him.

35:06.574 --> 35:08.742
No, you're plenty good.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.205
People don't like me.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.000
They liked him.

35:19.795 --> 35:22.130
He's probably looking down on me now...

35:23.215 --> 35:25.175
so goddamn disappointed.

35:47.865 --> 35:49.282
It's unacceptable!

35:50.451 --> 35:51.827
She was a few feet away from me.

35:51.910 --> 35:54.913
If she'd seen me, that's
it, it's all over.

35:54.997 --> 35:58.459
I don't think you realize how
vulnerable I was, how helpless.

35:58.542 --> 36:02.087
We've made progress. Longer
times, longer distances.

36:02.170 --> 36:04.673
Thought you said this godforsaken
slime was gonna expedite the process.

36:04.757 --> 36:07.009
It has. It's really
quite extraordinary.

36:07.092 --> 36:09.512
The stem cells have inherited
some of your genes.

36:09.595 --> 36:10.804
But will it work?

36:10.888 --> 36:13.098
Well, we need to do another
test when it's ready.

36:13.181 --> 36:16.393
- Why is it not ready now?
- Because I'm tired!

36:16.477 --> 36:19.312
If you'd let me rest,
I could focus better.

36:20.981 --> 36:22.315
Dad...

36:24.151 --> 36:25.694
go to the blender.

36:31.241 --> 36:32.409
Turn it on.

36:40.584 --> 36:43.587
Nice boat. Lower your
right hand in there.

36:47.132 --> 36:48.592
Slowly.

36:52.470 --> 36:53.556
Go on, slowly.

37:00.854 --> 37:02.397
Stop there.

37:06.735 --> 37:07.861
Are you focused?

37:10.823 --> 37:12.365
Still need a little nap time?

37:25.295 --> 37:28.340
When I first got these powers,
I took a trip to the junkyard.

37:29.257 --> 37:32.302
Started moving hunks of
metal back and forth.

37:32.385 --> 37:34.680
Rusted out cars, busted stoves.

37:34.763 --> 37:36.056
Just to see what I could lift.

37:36.139 --> 37:38.266
You were taking your
powers for a test drive.

37:38.350 --> 37:40.018
Kilgrave might test himself out, too.

37:40.102 --> 37:41.937
I've been searching.
Nothing is coming up.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.480
If someone would see me, they says,

37:43.564 --> 37:45.649
"Where's the wires? Where's
the hidden camera?"

37:47.568 --> 37:49.194
They'd think it was a hoax.

37:49.277 --> 37:51.488
Hoax, magic, performance art.

37:51.572 --> 37:53.198
You try that sort of thing, yet?

37:53.281 --> 37:55.033
You bucking for a P.I. job?

37:56.493 --> 37:58.996
"Horse fetishists
in Central Park"?

37:59.079 --> 38:01.039
No, everyone knows about them.

38:01.123 --> 38:02.249
Apparently.

38:03.250 --> 38:06.086
- This one.
- "Magic word is 'wankers'."

38:07.838 --> 38:11.508
<i>So, the band's on their last song,
when this guy just walks out on stage.</i>

38:11.592 --> 38:13.677
<i>And the band's all,
like, "What the hell?"</i>

38:13.761 --> 38:16.513
<i>And then this guy grabs
the mic and says,</i>

38:16.597 --> 38:19.182
<i>"Shut up, you wankers."</i>

38:19.266 --> 38:24.647
<i>And then, like, almost everybody in the
whole place just shuts the hell up.</i>

38:27.691 --> 38:29.567
If that's him, then the
upgrade is working.

38:29.652 --> 38:32.195
The Delaney Hall holds 600 people.

38:32.279 --> 38:34.657
Could be he can get to you now.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.283
Let's check their security cameras.

38:36.366 --> 38:38.201
See if one got him leaving.
License plate, maybe.

38:38.285 --> 38:39.828
I don't want you to...

38:46.043 --> 38:47.628
get hurt.

38:48.921 --> 38:50.130
Thank you.

38:54.551 --> 38:55.969
I'll put some clothes on.

39:04.687 --> 39:06.438
If you're
mind-controlled to drown me,

39:06.521 --> 39:09.066
I'm dragging you in too, fair warning.

39:09.149 --> 39:13.028
Look, broomstick, you're
into me, it happens.

39:14.112 --> 39:16.281
Romantic backdrop, it's working.

39:17.157 --> 39:19.159
But I'm in mourning.

39:26.834 --> 39:28.711
You should talk to Ruben.

39:34.216 --> 39:35.633
He's here?

39:36.468 --> 39:37.803
You put him...

39:39.262 --> 39:40.848
with the fishes?

39:47.980 --> 39:49.522
We're Pisces, you know.

39:50.273 --> 39:51.859
It's a water sign.

39:53.443 --> 39:55.570
You know what the symbol for Pisces is?

39:59.449 --> 40:01.326
It's two fishes...

40:01.409 --> 40:05.455
swimming together...
in an infinite circle.

40:05.538 --> 40:08.709
Ruben and I used to say that's
how we were in the womb.

40:12.545 --> 40:14.672
I'm just... I'm so sorry.

40:24.391 --> 40:25.517
Enough.

40:29.730 --> 40:33.358
Pisces are the most
forgiving of the zodiac.

40:35.736 --> 40:37.320
You forgive me?

40:37.404 --> 40:39.489
I've thought about breaking
into your apartment

40:39.572 --> 40:41.784
and sticking a screwdriver
into your eye.

40:42.951 --> 40:44.161
Biblical.

40:45.245 --> 40:46.496
Eye for an eye.

40:47.414 --> 40:49.416
But the whole world goes blind.

40:50.751 --> 40:54.880
So what, we should all just let
everyone off the hook then, huh?

40:54.963 --> 40:57.841
Just the people that matter to you.

40:57.925 --> 41:00.928
That way when they
die, you feel love...

41:01.011 --> 41:02.429
not regret.

41:05.974 --> 41:07.100
Here.

41:19.905 --> 41:21.114
Goodbye, Ruben.

41:22.950 --> 41:26.328
I hope they have free
express shipping in heaven.

41:45.013 --> 41:46.098
Closed.

41:46.181 --> 41:48.475
Breaking and entering, my specialty.

41:48.558 --> 41:50.811
As well as punching, kickin',
drinkin' and talkin' shit.

41:50.894 --> 41:53.063
The four essentials of being a P.I.

41:54.147 --> 41:55.232
Not closed.

41:56.066 --> 41:59.319
- Come back later?
- I got other specialties.

42:23.385 --> 42:24.427
Hey.

42:26.804 --> 42:27.973
Hey!

42:28.056 --> 42:30.767
We're closed. Get out of here.

42:30.851 --> 42:33.103
New York State Liquor Authority.

42:34.104 --> 42:35.563
Undercover.

42:35.647 --> 42:37.983
We got reports of underage
drinking in here.

42:38.066 --> 42:39.567
We ID everyone at the door.

42:39.651 --> 42:41.528
Oh, including those
underage high school girls

42:41.611 --> 42:43.446
doing shots of Jäger in
the front row last night?

42:43.530 --> 42:45.282
Well, you got bad info.

42:45.365 --> 42:48.660
Then you got nothing to hide.
We need to see video of the show.

42:48.743 --> 42:50.287
You want a raid, you got it.

42:50.370 --> 42:52.622
All right, my office
is up the back staircase.

43:01.048 --> 43:04.717
Oh, you know, these days, the
20-somethings, they look 30.

43:05.802 --> 43:08.721
And the ten-year-olds, they look 20.

43:09.639 --> 43:11.266
Why you looking at ten-year-olds, man?

43:11.349 --> 43:13.435
- It's just a saying.
- No, it's not.

43:15.938 --> 43:17.730
What? Don't tell me the
prices are goin' up.

43:19.441 --> 43:21.484
No, we're good. Still
gotta see the video.

43:21.568 --> 43:22.986
I got better things to do.

43:23.570 --> 43:24.737
We don't.

43:40.837 --> 43:43.381
- Man, what the hell is this?
- No video.

43:44.299 --> 43:46.718
- Even the audio files are gone.
- It's been erased.

43:46.801 --> 43:49.804
Not by me. All the cameras
are still working.

43:51.431 --> 43:54.101
Check, one, two, one, two.
Can you hear me at the back?

43:54.184 --> 43:56.436
Oh, hell.
What, this guy again?

44:00.815 --> 44:03.735
Hello, New York City!

44:05.362 --> 44:06.904
Get as far away as you can.

44:07.948 --> 44:09.616
- You heard her.
- What, you just can't...

44:09.699 --> 44:11.618
- Let's go! Go.
- Okay. All right.

44:16.957 --> 44:18.375
Keep your distance.

44:19.167 --> 44:20.210
Go.

44:38.728 --> 44:41.982
So, you found
my testing arena.

44:42.065 --> 44:43.691
All by yourself?

44:45.986 --> 44:48.113
Just followed
the trail of misery.

44:48.196 --> 44:51.366
Oh, that's a good band name.
Now for the real test.

44:51.449 --> 44:53.993
Stop there, Jessica Jones.

44:58.623 --> 44:59.957
God damn it!

45:02.794 --> 45:05.297
I want you to know, I
forgive you for everything.

45:05.922 --> 45:09.467
I'll say it every day for as
long as you need to hear it.

45:12.970 --> 45:14.556
You heard that?

45:17.059 --> 45:19.144
I wrote it!

45:19.227 --> 45:20.562
Surprise!

45:37.329 --> 45:41.083
Mr. Cage had been ordered to
ring me about your exploits

45:41.166 --> 45:43.710
since before he blew up
his seedy little bar.

45:44.502 --> 45:48.256
Uh, the 12-hour window at that
point was actually 16 hours.

45:48.340 --> 45:51.468
Now it's 24... and a hundred yards.

45:56.639 --> 45:58.850
Did you think he was
more powerful than me?

45:58.933 --> 46:02.229
With his unbreakable skin?
Is that why you desired him?

46:03.605 --> 46:05.898
You really thought I could forgive you?

46:06.858 --> 46:08.485
You killed my wife.

46:08.985 --> 46:11.571
- That's not you talking, that's him.
- Shut up.

46:12.572 --> 46:15.450
I tried so hard to avoid this, Jessica.

46:15.533 --> 46:17.577
This is not what I wanted.

46:18.328 --> 46:20.413
But you failed the test.

46:21.789 --> 46:22.790
Kill her.

46:23.916 --> 46:26.211
No. You can fight this.

46:26.836 --> 46:27.920
Luke.

46:57.867 --> 46:59.869
Every move he made was mine.

47:00.995 --> 47:02.121
Those tender moments.

47:03.122 --> 47:04.957
Those sweet things he
shared, it was all me.

47:06.376 --> 47:08.002
It was our sexual tension.

47:08.085 --> 47:09.546
It was all me!

47:13.049 --> 47:15.677
You chose wrong, Jessica.

47:15.760 --> 47:16.844
You always have.

47:17.595 --> 47:18.638
Stop her, Cage!

47:25.270 --> 47:27.104
You're stronger than me.
You can push him out.

47:27.897 --> 47:29.566
I can't.

47:42.912 --> 47:44.372
Wake the hell up.

49:05.870 --> 49:09.374
I know you can fight this.
I know you don't want to hurt me.

49:09.457 --> 49:11.626
I...

49:55.837 --> 49:57.505
No, listen, get out of here.
You need...

49:57.589 --> 49:59.632
- You, hands in the air.
- You need to get away.

49:59.716 --> 50:00.883
Listen to me.

50:00.967 --> 50:03.302
- We got a disturbance call. Check it out.
- No, don't!

50:03.386 --> 50:05.513
- Hands in the air!
- God damn it, you need to run!

50:05.597 --> 50:08.265
Freeze! Don't move!

51:02.570 --> 51:04.113
Please stop.

51:09.411 --> 51:10.703
Please stop.

51:15.875 --> 51:17.460
Do what you gotta do.

51:36.771 --> 51:38.440
I'm sorry.

51:40.858 --> 51:42.359
I'm so sorry.
