WEBVTT

00:05.126 --> 00:06.717
Bummer that we're gonna
have to spend our vacation

00:06.717 --> 00:08.339
studying for the final exam.

00:08.339 --> 00:11.762
Yeah, but if I pass,
I'll finally get out of
this accelerated program,

00:11.762 --> 00:14.305
graduate from high school,
and live my dream.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.637
The dream of being
on the BMX circuit,

00:16.637 --> 00:19.350
not the dream where I'm playing
foosball with a chimp.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.102
Which is really
more of a nightmare.

00:21.102 --> 00:22.313
Every time he scores,
he goes...

00:22.313 --> 00:24.735
( blows raspberry )

00:24.735 --> 00:28.149
Hey, when we play foosball
and I score, I go...

00:28.149 --> 00:31.282
Yeah, I was hoping you'd
take the hint, you chimp.

00:31.282 --> 00:34.325
When I pass the final,
I'm gonna live my dream

00:34.325 --> 00:35.866
of joining the PNX circuit.

00:35.866 --> 00:38.829
Pizza, Naps
and Extreme Naps.

00:38.829 --> 00:40.711
What's an extreme nap?

00:40.711 --> 00:44.505
You start out standing up,
and you wake up somewhere else.

00:45.716 --> 00:48.169
Gentlemen, keep it down.

00:48.169 --> 00:49.930
And, Tyler,
I've got my eye on you.

00:49.930 --> 00:52.133
The left one; the right one
is for everyone else.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.265
Actually, putting my left eye
where my right one goes

00:54.265 --> 00:55.266
is making my head hurt.

00:55.266 --> 00:57.348
Tyler, sit over here.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.181
Oh, come on, Principal Lawson.
I pull one senior prank,

01:00.181 --> 01:02.313
and suddenly I'm branded
as a bad kid.

01:02.313 --> 01:05.146
Tyler, you have a long history
of disruptive behavior.

01:05.146 --> 01:07.318
And that waterslide prank
rendered me so afraid of water

01:07.318 --> 01:10.281
that my Dominican timeshare
is useless to me.

01:10.281 --> 01:12.953
Which is a shame because this
body was almost beach ready.

01:15.035 --> 01:16.787
Man, he's really
got it in for me.

01:16.787 --> 01:18.199
Can you believe that, Erik?

01:19.960 --> 01:22.123
Whoa, extreme nap!

01:24.795 --> 01:26.757
STAN:
It's school vacation this week

01:26.757 --> 01:29.340
and my family is staying local
so Tyler can study.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.302
Last year they left town
and couldn't take me,

01:31.302 --> 01:33.264
so they hired a dog walker.

01:33.264 --> 01:35.015
The rest of the time I did

01:35.015 --> 01:36.347
what all dogs do
when we're left home alone.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.639
Put on people clothes
and dance.

01:38.639 --> 01:40.601
( music playing )

02:03.244 --> 02:07.708
Always have to one-up me,
Robert, don't ya?

02:24.355 --> 02:26.727
Avery, it's our
one-week anniversary,

02:26.727 --> 02:28.269
and since we don't go
to the same school,

02:28.269 --> 02:31.031
I wanted to give you a gift
that you'd remember.

02:31.031 --> 02:32.863
So I wrote you a song.

02:32.863 --> 02:37.328
Oh, Brian,
you are so perfect.

02:37.328 --> 02:39.830
Perfect?
You're coming on too strong.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.041
You'll scare him off.

02:41.041 --> 02:42.203
Play it smooth.

02:42.203 --> 02:45.045
Perfect-ly dressed
for this weather.

02:45.045 --> 02:47.087
I mean,
you can't go wrong with layers.

02:47.087 --> 02:51.051
But enough about
flexible dressing.
How about that song?

02:54.215 --> 02:57.428
♪ When I see you
I just stare ♪

02:57.428 --> 03:01.602

03:26.247 --> 03:31.292
You are so ama--ailman.

03:31.292 --> 03:35.005
A mailman.
You really delivered.
On that song.

03:35.005 --> 03:37.888
Nailed it.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.550
I think it's time

03:39.550 --> 03:42.012
we take the next major step
in our relationship.

03:42.012 --> 03:45.015
The next major step
in our relationship
is meeting your dog?

03:45.015 --> 03:47.398
Well, we could hold hands
while you're doing it.

03:47.398 --> 03:48.979
I'm kidding.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.312
Unless you want to.

03:51.312 --> 03:53.484
I think you're wonderful,
Avery.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.566
And your dog
is very handsome.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.319
Awww.
Awww.

03:58.319 --> 04:00.281
Whoa!

04:00.281 --> 04:03.954
This is better than
the massage chair at the mall.

04:03.954 --> 04:06.417
Plus, no one's
kicking me out.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.461
I got to get going, Avery.
But I'll text you later.

04:10.461 --> 04:11.962
I'm gonna miss you both.

04:11.962 --> 04:14.084
Awww.
Awww.

04:17.968 --> 04:20.090
Isn't he incredible, Stan?

04:20.090 --> 04:23.053
Yes. Why don't you ever
pet me like that?

04:24.435 --> 04:25.436
How's that?

04:25.436 --> 04:27.978
Fine.

04:27.978 --> 04:30.230
Can I have Brian's number?

04:32.943 --> 04:36.066
Man, I've been so busy studying
I don't have time for girls.

04:36.066 --> 04:38.238
It's like I'm dating my books.

04:38.238 --> 04:42.032
I love you, history,
but you're too old for me.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.204
Maybe you should
stick to science.

04:44.204 --> 04:46.787
The two of you have
so much chemistry.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.041
Periodic one, Ellen.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.374
I'm studying geography.

04:53.374 --> 04:55.466
I can name
capitals of countries now.

04:55.466 --> 04:58.419
Oh, you can?
That's great, sweetie.

04:58.419 --> 05:01.342
I used to be able to do
the same thing when I was a kid.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.345
What is Lima the capital of?

05:04.345 --> 05:06.887
Peru!
Mmm, very impressive, Chloe.

05:06.887 --> 05:08.058
Ooh, do me now.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.851
Wellington.
New Zealand.

05:10.851 --> 05:13.233
Oh, man,
Daddy still got it.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.486
Ellen, you want
a piece of this action?

05:15.486 --> 05:18.028
Oh, I don't know
capitals of countries.

05:18.028 --> 05:20.150
I know a lot of things,
but capitals of countries

05:20.150 --> 05:22.493
just happen to be one of
the few things I don't know.

05:22.493 --> 05:26.867
Try me on '80s teen heartthrobs
or beloved sit-com moms.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.829
Like Phylicia Rashad or...

05:29.950 --> 05:32.122
Pass!

05:32.122 --> 05:34.254
Oh, come on.
Capitals are easy.

05:34.254 --> 05:36.877
Can you tell me what country
Nairobi is the capital of?

05:36.877 --> 05:38.088
I can't.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.129
Kenya.

05:39.129 --> 05:40.841
I can't.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.553
No.
Kenya.

05:42.553 --> 05:45.175
I told you, Chloe.
I ken-not!

05:48.429 --> 05:51.562
Max, where's Lindsay?
I have something exciting
to tell you both.

05:51.562 --> 05:55.686
I do too, or did my excited face
already give it away?

05:55.686 --> 05:57.818
Avery, Max, I have big news.

05:57.818 --> 05:59.319
I have a new boyfriend.

05:59.319 --> 06:01.321
So do I.
So do I.

06:01.321 --> 06:04.324
He's a little cheerful,
but I can bring him down.

06:04.324 --> 06:05.946
My guy's a musician.

06:05.946 --> 06:06.947
So is mine.

06:06.947 --> 06:08.118
So is mine.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.119
He wrote me a song.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.250
Mine too.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.953
Mine too.

We're all dating the same guy.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.287
I can't believe

06:47.287 --> 06:49.289
Brian's dating all three of us
at the same time.

06:49.289 --> 06:52.623
And he wrote us
all the same song.
What a jerk.

06:52.623 --> 06:54.585
I cannot wait to tell him
I'm never going to
see him again.

06:54.585 --> 06:56.587
Yeah, you both
should do that.

06:56.587 --> 06:58.208
I guess
I'll just have to be the one

06:58.208 --> 07:01.502
to teach him how to be
a good boyfriend.

07:01.502 --> 07:03.383
Wait, you mean you want
to see him again?

07:03.383 --> 07:04.845
He's dating all three of us.

07:04.845 --> 07:07.718
So? What guy is good
at relationships?

07:07.718 --> 07:10.511
Well, clearly I'm the one
he likes the most.

07:10.511 --> 07:12.853
When he sang "I want
to take you somewhere fun,"

07:12.853 --> 07:14.314
he was obviously
talking about me.

07:14.314 --> 07:17.688
I'm the fun one!
Woo-hoo-hoo!

07:17.688 --> 07:19.109
Right, Brian?

07:21.191 --> 07:23.403
But he also sang
"you're my one and only one."

07:23.403 --> 07:26.406
There's only one of me.
There's two of you.

07:26.406 --> 07:28.659
If one of us is going
to get him, it should be me.

07:28.659 --> 07:30.621
"Keep you in a jar"?

07:30.621 --> 07:33.073
I'm the one who collects
medical oddities.

07:33.073 --> 07:36.076
I'm more his type
than either of you.
I'm the easygoing one.

07:36.076 --> 07:39.289
I am the easygoing one.
I haven't mentioned once
that you smell like bologna.

07:39.289 --> 07:42.132
I wear a bologna mask at night.
It's good for the skin.

07:42.132 --> 07:45.085
According to a website
I'm 90% sure is not a joke.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.388
Obviously I'm the one
Brian likes.

07:48.388 --> 07:50.010
Both of you, back off.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.512
You back off.
He's mine.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.013
No, he's mine.

07:53.013 --> 07:54.014
Let him go.

07:54.014 --> 07:55.015
You let him go!

07:55.015 --> 07:56.146
You let him go.

07:58.268 --> 07:59.439
I've got the head!
I win!

07:59.439 --> 08:01.271
Yeah!

08:01.271 --> 08:04.364
( shrieks )
Brian, what have I done?

08:07.868 --> 08:09.530
Yes!
I passed!

08:09.530 --> 08:11.702
I've officially graduated
from high school.

08:11.702 --> 08:14.204
The long road from
kindergarten ends here.

08:14.204 --> 08:17.167
And I never did learn cursive.
Take that, Mrs. Durbin!

08:18.709 --> 08:21.081
BMX circuit, here I come!

08:21.081 --> 08:22.252
I passed too!

08:22.252 --> 08:23.884
PNX circuit here I come!

08:25.335 --> 08:27.387
I've got my pizza right here,
and then after,

08:27.387 --> 08:29.179
I'm gonna go home
and take a nap.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.592
An extreme nap, right?
No, it's gonna be
a normal nap.

08:31.592 --> 08:34.474
But with extreme pajamas.
What makes them extreme?

08:34.474 --> 08:36.476
They have
monster trucks on them!

08:38.518 --> 08:40.440
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, you two.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.312
I was reviewing
your answer sheets

08:42.312 --> 08:44.695
and you both have
the exact same answers.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.857
BOTH: All right!

08:46.857 --> 08:48.989
That means one of you
copied off of the other one.

08:48.989 --> 08:51.281
BOTH: All-- What?

08:51.281 --> 08:54.785
Tyler, you're out
of the accelerated program.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.286
What?
You think I cheated?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.999
Of course. You've been
in detention so much

08:58.999 --> 09:00.581
that when we send
other students to detention,

09:00.581 --> 09:02.542
we say "go see Tyler."

09:02.542 --> 09:04.665
This is so unfair.

09:04.665 --> 09:06.256
I didn't cheat on my test.

09:06.256 --> 09:08.338
Really? You've been
in detention so much,

09:08.338 --> 09:12.172
it's the only class you have
perfect attendance in.

09:12.172 --> 09:14.014
You've been
in detention so much--

09:14.014 --> 09:15.636
You know what, I have a binder
full of these back in my office.

09:15.636 --> 09:16.677
I'm gonna go get it.

09:19.019 --> 09:21.271
Dude,
I can't believe this.

09:21.271 --> 09:24.144
If I don't graduate now,
I can't join the BMX circuit.

09:24.144 --> 09:25.736
They're gonna
give away my spot.

09:25.736 --> 09:26.737
Tough break, man.

09:26.737 --> 09:29.149
And I didn't even cheat.

09:29.149 --> 09:32.192
So either you cheated,
or it's all a huge coincidence.

09:32.192 --> 09:34.284
Right.
Coincidence.

09:34.284 --> 09:36.406
You're pretty smart
to think of that.

09:36.406 --> 09:38.198
I knew I picked
the right guy to cheat off of.

09:43.003 --> 09:44.544
AVERY:
She wears a bologna mask

09:44.544 --> 09:47.838
which is both weird
and a waste of bologna.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.841
So then Max, Lindsay,
and I had such a big fight

09:50.841 --> 09:53.383
we haven't spoken to each other
since science class.

09:53.383 --> 09:55.555
We're still liking each others'
selfies on Buddy Bop

09:55.555 --> 09:58.598
'cause they're super-cute,
but we're not speaking.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.811
So if I'm following
this story,

10:00.811 --> 10:03.223
what I'm getting is:
next time I lick Lindsay,

10:03.223 --> 10:06.647
she's going to
taste like bologna.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.029
No, you are not
following the story.

10:09.029 --> 10:10.991
Was it ham?

10:10.991 --> 10:13.033
No.

10:13.033 --> 10:16.366
The point is Lindsay and Max
are trying to take my boyfriend.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.199
Avery, let me tell you
a little story.

10:19.199 --> 10:21.041
A few days ago,
I was in the park

10:21.041 --> 10:23.043
tussling with
two of my dog friends

10:23.043 --> 10:25.205
over a ratty,
stinky old shoe.

10:25.205 --> 10:29.209
I got the stinky shoe,
but I lost my two friends.

10:29.209 --> 10:32.843
Oh, my gosh, Stan.
You're right.

10:32.843 --> 10:35.595
Why would we fight over someone
who would treat us this way?

10:35.595 --> 10:38.428
He's not worth
losing my friends over.

10:38.428 --> 10:42.142
Brian is nothing
but a ratty, stinky old shoe.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.725
No, the point is
it was totally worth it.

10:44.725 --> 10:48.188
Ratty, stinky old shoes
are the best.

10:48.188 --> 10:51.361
Now who's not
following the story?

10:51.361 --> 10:53.573
No, Stan, Brian is a jerk

10:53.573 --> 10:56.036
who's dating all three of us
at the same time.

10:56.036 --> 10:57.988
I'm gonna patch things up
with Lindsay and Max,

10:57.988 --> 10:59.830
and then
I am breaking up with him.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.372
Really?
Are you sure?

11:02.372 --> 11:04.334
Yes, Stan, I am sure.

11:04.334 --> 11:07.377
You know you want a taste.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.292
And that's how
cognitive behavior therapy

11:12.292 --> 11:14.214
changes performance
through modification

11:14.214 --> 11:17.137
of reinforcement
contingencies.

11:17.137 --> 11:19.930
Guys, I just spent
the last 24 hours

11:19.930 --> 11:22.142
memorizing all the capitals of
all the countries in the world.

11:22.142 --> 11:27.107
Go ahead, quiz me, quiz me,
I really have to pee, quiz me.

11:27.107 --> 11:29.109
Ellen, that seems
a little overboard.

11:29.109 --> 11:31.071
Well, it's just that
I know so many things

11:31.071 --> 11:32.692
and I didn't get a chance
to prove it

11:32.692 --> 11:34.614
with capitals of countries,
but now I can.

11:34.614 --> 11:37.077
Go ahead, Chloe,
name a country.
Samoa!

11:37.077 --> 11:39.079
Mommy,
I'm over capitals anyway.

11:39.079 --> 11:41.371
I've moved on
to memorizing Greek gods.

11:41.371 --> 11:42.953
Greek mythology?

11:42.953 --> 11:44.664
That's one of the few things
I don't know.

11:44.664 --> 11:47.127
It's my
what's-his-name's heel!

11:47.127 --> 11:50.290
Achilles.

11:50.290 --> 11:52.542
I swear I know
a lot of things, Chloe.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.634
It's driving me crazy
that every time you guys
talk about something,

11:54.634 --> 11:56.716
it's one of the few things
I don't know.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.339
I'm sure you do know
a lot of things, Mommy.

11:59.339 --> 12:01.391
How about constellations?

12:01.391 --> 12:03.393
Next category.

12:03.393 --> 12:04.684
Types of rocks?

12:04.684 --> 12:07.107
Go back to constellations.

12:07.107 --> 12:08.348
Oh, Mommy.

12:13.403 --> 12:15.906
Principal Lawson kicked me
out of the accelerated program.

12:15.906 --> 12:17.908
What?
That's terrible.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.700
He says I cheated
and you may not believe this,
but I didn't.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.953
We believe you, son.

12:22.953 --> 12:26.366
We know you're not lying
because we know your tell.
I have a tell?

12:26.366 --> 12:28.999
Everyone has a mannerism that
gives away when they're lying.

12:28.999 --> 12:33.173
Watch. Hey, honey, you read
my latest book, right?

12:33.173 --> 12:35.715
Of course I did.

12:35.715 --> 12:38.378
Did you spot it?

12:38.378 --> 12:40.340
None of this is helping.

12:40.340 --> 12:43.383
I'm gonna lose my shot at BMX
because my friend Erik cheated

12:43.383 --> 12:44.935
and he's letting me
take the fall.

12:44.935 --> 12:46.306
Why didn't you
tell the principal?

12:46.306 --> 12:47.597
What kind of person
do you think I am?

12:47.597 --> 12:49.309
I can't rat out a friend.

12:49.309 --> 12:51.311
Oh, that reminds me,
Avery broke your vase.

12:52.692 --> 12:54.154
If he's letting you
take the blame,

12:54.154 --> 12:55.816
he doesn't seem like
a very good friend.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.777
I asked him to step up
and confess

12:57.777 --> 13:00.110
and he said he couldn't talk
while he was eating pizza.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.282
Which is totally weird

13:02.282 --> 13:04.574
'cause he said that
while he was eating pizza.

13:04.574 --> 13:06.496
And he only
offered me a small piece

13:06.496 --> 13:08.248
whose pepperoni
had been pulled off
by the cheese

13:08.248 --> 13:10.290
of the neighbor piece!
He is not a friend!

13:12.412 --> 13:14.414
Well, then you have
a choice to make.

13:14.414 --> 13:17.257
And we know you'll make
the right decision.

13:20.921 --> 13:23.263
Stan, I don't know
what to do about Erik.

13:23.263 --> 13:27.017
Okay. Wow.
You and Avery are both
involved in cheating stories,

13:27.017 --> 13:29.599
so this might be a little hard
for me to navigate.

13:29.599 --> 13:31.191
But I know this:

13:31.191 --> 13:33.233
Erik is two-timing you
with Lindsay and Max,

13:33.233 --> 13:35.856
and you have to
break up with him.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.898
I'm not Erik's girlfriend.

13:37.898 --> 13:40.070
Well, Lindsay will be
happy to hear that

13:40.070 --> 13:42.202
because I know
she wanted him for herself.

13:43.904 --> 13:46.576
But don't worry.
I'll sort it all out.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.328
It'll be easier
than convincing Avery

13:48.328 --> 13:50.250
she needs
a new beauty treatment.

13:54.624 --> 13:56.456
Stan!

13:56.456 --> 13:58.258
What?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.462
Oh, good,
you guys are together.

14:02.462 --> 14:05.225
You made up?
No, we're still mad.

14:05.225 --> 14:07.307
We just have to be
at our work station
because we're lab partners.

14:07.307 --> 14:08.969
We're already
in enough trouble for that.

14:11.311 --> 14:14.314
Guys, I was thinking about
this whole Brian thing

14:14.314 --> 14:17.147
and I realized we shouldn't
be mad at each other.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.399
We should be mad at him.

14:19.399 --> 14:22.862
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.945
I can't believe
I lost sight of that.

14:24.945 --> 14:27.867
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that, too.
He's the jerk.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.370
I don't say this very often
because the words make me gag,

14:30.370 --> 14:34.254
but I love you guys.
See?

14:36.256 --> 14:38.668
Yeah, you guys should
totally break up with him,

14:38.668 --> 14:39.669
and I'll be sure
to tell him

14:39.669 --> 14:42.302
what a jerk he is
on our next date.

14:43.303 --> 14:46.506
Lindsay...
But he plays ukulele.

14:46.506 --> 14:48.308
All right, all right,
our friendship's more important,

14:48.308 --> 14:50.680
blah, blah, blah.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.852
I really love you guys, too.

14:52.852 --> 14:56.146
Aww.

14:56.146 --> 14:58.358
There's only two things
left to do now.

14:58.358 --> 15:00.650
Get revenge on Brian

15:00.650 --> 15:02.862
and get a selfie of us
plotting revenge

15:02.862 --> 15:04.864
'cause those are super-cute.

15:07.447 --> 15:08.868
Aww, man.

15:08.868 --> 15:10.951
Volleyball-head-skeleton
photobombed us.

15:19.589 --> 15:22.752
Oh, sorry I'm late.
It's always
some teacher's birthday.

15:22.752 --> 15:24.634
I love cake,
but if I want that beach body,

15:24.634 --> 15:26.756
I've got to fire
some faculty.

15:26.756 --> 15:29.719
Wouldn't it be easier
to have a no-cake rule?

15:29.719 --> 15:32.182
A birthday without cake?
What are you, heartless?

15:34.054 --> 15:36.606
Principal Lawson,
thanks for agreeing to see us.

15:36.606 --> 15:38.358
I wanted to talk to you
about the test.

15:38.358 --> 15:39.939
You mean the test
you cheated on?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.732
That's the thing,
I didn't cheat, Erik did.

15:42.732 --> 15:44.774
It's hard for me to
say that 'cause I thought
he was my friend.

15:44.774 --> 15:46.566
But he proved that he's not.

15:46.566 --> 15:49.239
He gave me a piece of pizza
without the pepperoni on it.

15:49.239 --> 15:53.033
Just the greasy puddle
where it once lived.

15:53.033 --> 15:55.455
That is a very serious
accusation, young man.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.999
And the cheating thing, too.
Why do you expect me
to believe you?

15:58.999 --> 16:01.381
Principal Lawson,
our son told us that

16:01.381 --> 16:05.385
he did not cheat on this test,
and we believe him.

16:05.385 --> 16:07.427
And I believe I'm not gonna
forage through the garbage can

16:07.427 --> 16:08.888
for that piece of cake
after you leave,

16:08.888 --> 16:11.141
but that doesn't
make it the truth.

16:11.141 --> 16:14.264
Especially after I've carefully
lined it with sanitary plastic.

16:14.264 --> 16:18.858
What if we provided evidence
that Tyler did not cheat?

16:18.858 --> 16:19.899
That's a great idea!

16:19.899 --> 16:21.231
He'll take the test over.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.273
That's a terrible idea.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.864
I don't want to take
the test again.

16:24.864 --> 16:26.906
My brain is already
on vacation.

16:26.906 --> 16:29.239
It's on the beach
scoping out girl brains.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.742
Check out the frontal lobe
on that one.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.614
Tyler, you haven't said
a single thing

16:34.614 --> 16:36.246
to convince me
that you're not a cheater.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.418
If I have to,
let's get it over with.

16:38.418 --> 16:40.250
Ask me any question
on the test.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.672
I'm proud of you
for doing this, Tyler.

16:42.672 --> 16:46.296
And I know
you're gonna ace this test.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.468
Okay, Tyler, I'm going to
ask you some random questions

16:48.468 --> 16:50.260
from what you studied.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.263
First question, what year did
the Mexican-American War start?

16:53.263 --> 16:54.224
1846!

16:54.224 --> 16:56.306
Ellen,
this is Tyler's test.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.897
But I know this,
this is something I know.

16:57.897 --> 16:58.898
1846.

16:58.898 --> 17:00.730
Correct!

17:00.730 --> 17:02.522
Mrs. Jennings, pipe down.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.314
Unless you want
to go see Tyler.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.697
Next question...

17:09.779 --> 17:11.321
Covalent bond.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.992
Correct.

17:12.992 --> 17:16.035
Congratulations, you graduated.
You answered every question.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.707
Clearly, you know
the material.

17:17.707 --> 17:21.541
That's great, honey.
I knew all of it, too!

17:21.541 --> 17:24.003
Tyler, you have inspired me by
learning all of that material.

17:24.003 --> 17:25.715
If you can do that,

17:25.715 --> 17:27.837
then I don't need to eat
cake from the trash can.

17:27.837 --> 17:31.171
So I do it because I want to,
not because I need to.

17:37.177 --> 17:38.978
Okay, I think
I've finally got

17:38.978 --> 17:40.940
these two cheating stories
straight.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.683
You're here at the food festival
so you and the other girls

17:43.683 --> 17:47.607
can get even with Brian for
dating all three of you at once.

17:47.607 --> 17:50.690
No, I'm here celebrating
the fact that I graduated.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.113
So you're gonna
keep dating Brian?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.534
If you act
like a doormat, Tyler,

17:54.534 --> 17:57.787
guys are going to keep
taking advantage of you.

17:57.787 --> 17:59.619
Stan, I am not a girl.

17:59.619 --> 18:03.163
Shh, Tyler, people are going
to figure out you can talk.

18:04.794 --> 18:07.086
But I'm proud of you
for graduating.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.259
I want to get you
a graduation falafel.

18:09.259 --> 18:11.261
Ah, thanks, Stan, but
you can't order at the booth.

18:11.261 --> 18:13.263
That's okay,
I can't pay for it either.

18:13.263 --> 18:17.387
Get mine with extra hummus.
Happy graduation!

18:20.220 --> 18:22.892
Hey, dude,
you ratted me out.

18:22.892 --> 18:24.564
The principal
made me redo the test

18:24.564 --> 18:26.436
and now I'm out of
the accelerated program.

18:26.436 --> 18:28.608
And he took my pizza,
it was weird, man.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.231
He put it in his trash
and then he ate it.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.574
You know, friends
don't do what you did.

18:34.574 --> 18:37.447
That's true,
because we stopped
being friends

18:37.447 --> 18:40.790
when you cheated off me
and hung me out to dry.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.292
See you, dude.
Enjoy high school.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.705
Wait, I'm in line for falafel.
You get out of here.

18:48.248 --> 18:50.420
Hey, Brian,
I'm pretty hungry.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.252
Would you mind getting me
a spicy pork burrito?

18:52.252 --> 18:53.803
Anything for you, Avery.

18:53.803 --> 18:56.386
I hate spicy food, but
whatever makes you happy.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.057
Great, thanks.

18:58.057 --> 19:00.850
And I'll make sure
that you get yours.

19:00.850 --> 19:03.223
Get my what?

19:03.223 --> 19:06.105
Whatever you want to eat,
corn dogs, chips.

19:06.105 --> 19:08.318
What's coming to you.

19:16.366 --> 19:18.658
Lindsay!

19:18.658 --> 19:20.660
Hey, Brian.
I didn't know you'd be here.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.282
Is that your spicy burrito?

19:22.282 --> 19:23.993
Uh...

19:23.993 --> 19:25.875
I thought
you didn't like spicy foods.

19:25.875 --> 19:28.498
I see what's going on here.

19:28.498 --> 19:30.710
You do?
Yes.
You're trying new things.

19:30.710 --> 19:33.132
That's so cool.
Eat it, eat it,
eat it all up.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.848
I'll get us some drinks,
but I love watching you eat.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.470
I'm not leaving until
you eat the whole thing.

19:47.517 --> 19:48.688
Isn't that great?

19:49.769 --> 19:51.521
Yeah.
I love it.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.315
A spicy beef taco, please.

19:55.315 --> 19:57.407
Can you get that for me?
I'll be right back.

19:58.528 --> 19:59.529
Hey, Brian.

19:59.529 --> 20:02.532
Hey, Max.

20:02.532 --> 20:06.125
I didn't know you'd be here.
Is that your spicy beef taco?

20:06.125 --> 20:08.708
Uh...
Well, I'll go get us
some drinks,

20:08.708 --> 20:10.380
but first I want to watch you
eat the whole taco.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.332
Eat it, eat it,
eat it all up.

20:18.388 --> 20:20.300
Isn't that good?

20:20.300 --> 20:23.142
Yeah.
Fantastic.

20:23.142 --> 20:25.345
Jalapeño poppers, please.

20:25.345 --> 20:27.267
Could you get those?
I'll get those drinks.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.351
Hey, where's
my spicy burrito?

20:31.351 --> 20:33.693
Oh, you got yourself
jalapeño poppers.

20:33.693 --> 20:35.485
Trying new things.
I like that.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.657
Eat it, eat it,
eat it all up.

20:56.376 --> 20:58.638
There you are,
I brought you dessert.

20:58.638 --> 21:00.340
There you are,
I brought you dessert.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.221
There you are,
I brought you dessert.

21:07.226 --> 21:11.060
So I'm guessing
you three know each other.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.442
We're best friends.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.354
You messed with
the wrong girls.

21:14.354 --> 21:17.066
So what are you doing later?

21:17.066 --> 21:19.399
I mean, you messed
with the wrong girls.

21:19.399 --> 21:22.862
Now, if you'll excuse us,
this is where we hug.

21:28.247 --> 21:30.079
STAN:
So Avery graduated high school

21:30.079 --> 21:33.082
and Tyler and the other girls
ate a lot of food.

21:33.082 --> 21:36.085
I'm pretty sure
none of that is right.

21:36.085 --> 21:38.378
I'm not talking to you, Brian.

21:38.378 --> 21:40.420
You cheated on the test.

21:40.420 --> 21:43.302
Erik is the one
who cheated on the test.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.425
Why would you rat out
your friend like that?

21:45.425 --> 21:48.187
And where's my falafel?

21:48.187 --> 21:51.521
Stan, maybe you should
just take this week off
and not write a blog.

21:51.521 --> 21:54.273
You're really getting
everything confused.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.235
Sometimes I wonder

21:56.235 --> 21:59.028
if you deserve
that Dominican timeshare.

21:59.028 --> 22:01.150
Anyway, good luck, Charlie.
