WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.796
[Frank] Hey, hey!
What do you think of these, guys?

00:04.880 --> 00:07.840
[Mac]
My God, Frank. My God.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.592
You look ridiculous in those, dude.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.637
Dude, why are you wearing skinny jeans?
Because they're hip.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.098
And I want to stay young.
Well, stay old, bro.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.016
Because that looks terrible.
Dress your age.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.185
I like 'em. I think they
make me look sexy. [Laughs]

00:19.311 --> 00:22.689
I am getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment
watching you parade around in those things.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.816
- So I say keep them.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.819
It's like a Humpty Dumpty vibe going on
with those. I don't know if you want...

00:27.903 --> 00:30.655
Yo-oh! Big news, bitches!
The ban's been lifted.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.908
And we are back in.
Flipadelphia, here we come!

00:33.992 --> 00:37.662
Ohh!
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

00:37.746 --> 00:39.747
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

00:39.832 --> 00:40.832
Flip!
Flip!

00:40.916 --> 00:43.334
Flip- Yeah!
Adelphia!

00:43.460 --> 00:46.337
What the hell is Flipadelphia?
What is Flipadelphia?

00:46.422 --> 00:49.048
Dude, it's a city-wide
flip cup tournament. It's the best.

00:49.133 --> 00:52.051
Yeah. We were the bar to beat
10 years ago until we got muscled out.

00:52.136 --> 00:55.054
Yeah. They very, very unfairly accused
us of poisoning our rival team.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.681
Yes.
You got framed?

00:56.765 --> 00:59.142
No, we did poison the shit out of them.
But they didn't have any proof.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.811
So you have a rival?
Oh, yeah, big-time.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.730
This dive bar down the
street called Molly's. Yeah.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.357
Yeah, yeah. This year we're gonna
jam it right up their butt holes.

01:06.483 --> 01:11.738
Ohh! Wow. Yeah, me, Dennis and
Charlie will jam their butt holes.

01:11.864 --> 01:15.324
You're not gonna come anywhere near their butt holes.
Let us handle the butt holes.

01:15.409 --> 01:19.036
What are you talking about?
You guys, I- I'm your number four.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.122
I'm your "Adelphia.
" And you can't- Yeah, I know.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.250
But, Dee, I mean, what, do you,
like, not remember the past?

01:24.334 --> 01:27.170
You choked under pressure in '98.
You blew the whole thing.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.922
We were gonna win. And then
you couldn't flip your damn cup over.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.216
I know, Charlie! That's why
I've been practicing ever since.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.510
I mean, you gotta give me
a chance to redeem myself.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.554
Okay, fine. You will have
a chance to redeem yourself.

01:36.638 --> 01:40.433
In the meantime, what do you say we
throw a little gas on the rivalry fire?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.969
[Frank] I thought you said
this place was a shithole.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.806
Yeah, it was. But looks like
they've made a few renovations.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.808
All right, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.851
Could be a scheme.
Okay, you guys ready?

02:23.936 --> 02:25.937
Probably, yeah.
Guess who, bitches!

02:26.021 --> 02:28.898
[Shouting]
Are you guys hungry, huh?

02:28.982 --> 02:32.026
Enjoying your meals?
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

02:32.152 --> 02:34.987
Oh, everybody have some lemon on it.
Yeah.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.114
Honk, honk, honk.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.868
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

02:40.953 --> 02:46.791
Will they highest ranking member
of the staff please step forward?

02:46.917 --> 02:50.294
I'm, uh, Art Sloan.
I'm the owner. Huh?

02:50.420 --> 02:53.464
[Laughing]
Uh, you're Art Sloan?

02:53.549 --> 02:55.508
Now see, you look very different
from what I remember.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.510
Do I know you people?

02:57.594 --> 03:01.722
Uh, allow me to refresh
your memory. Ohh!

03:01.807 --> 03:03.558
Whoa, whoa.
What- What the hell is that?

03:03.684 --> 03:07.186
Flip cup. Ten years ago?
We poisoned you, dude. Remember?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.981
Oh, wait a minute, yeah.
We got really sick. Yeah.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.066
You acted sick.
But check it out.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.736
Who's to say we didn't put that very
same poison in the drinking water?

03:15.821 --> 03:18.447
- [All Groaning]
- Hey, everybody, relax.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.909
He's lying. He doesn't have any poison.
No, I don't have any on me.

03:21.994 --> 03:25.496
But I do keep some in my fridge
at home in the relish jar.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.958
There's poison in that jar?
I thought I was allergic to pickles.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.002
What's in the jar with
the skull and crossbones?

03:31.086 --> 03:32.837
Oh, that's mayonnaise.
That's a decoy.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.964
- And the mayo?
- That's shampoo.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.091
You're telling me I've been putting
shampoo on my sandwiches?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.802
If you're using the mayonnaise,
yeah, probably. I-I'm sorry.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.846
Is there something that
I can do for you people?

03:41.930 --> 03:45.641
Yeah! We came to tell you
we're reigniting the rivalry, dick worm.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.769
- It's back on, bitch! - You know what?
I-I am not your rival, okay?

03:48.854 --> 03:52.231
I never was. And I am certainly not
participating in Flipadelphia.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.442
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

03:54.568 --> 03:56.986
Flip, flip- Oh!
Looks like someone's scared, guys.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.739
Now you're just being childish.
[Dee] Oh, yeah?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.782
How's this for childish, bro?
[Urinating]

04:01.867 --> 04:04.368
All right, that's it!
I'm calling the cops.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.037
He pissed on your bar!
Yeah, call the cops!

04:06.121 --> 04:07.622
See you Saturday. Don't be late.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.669
Three, two, one, go!

04:13.754 --> 04:17.048
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

04:17.132 --> 04:19.091
No, no.
[All Shouting]

04:19.216 --> 04:21.093
No, you're doing it too high!
Get it! Get it!

04:21.219 --> 04:23.638
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.474
I don't know, you guys. I was...

04:26.600 --> 04:28.517
That was terrible!
I'm sorry, okay?

04:28.644 --> 04:30.728
I thought you had been practicing.
I have been practicing!

04:30.854 --> 04:33.105
I don't know what happened!
You know, it's her bison-sized fingers!

04:33.231 --> 04:35.274
I don't have bison fingers!
I don't have bison fingers. Oh, yes, you do.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.944
Your mother had to have a C-section
because of those hands.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.904
Okay, you guys are just
all screaming in my face!

04:39.988 --> 04:41.989
People are going to scream
at the tournament!

04:42.115 --> 04:44.033
That's it. She's off the team.
Shut up, Frank!

04:44.159 --> 04:47.411
You're not even on the team!
That's true. What is my role here?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.288
Why did you bring that up?
Yeah. All right.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.290
You're not gonna be on the flip cup team.
No. Definitely not.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.876
Maybe you could be, um, team instigator.
Yeah! There we go.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.628
That works. I'll be the instigator.
Sure. Yeah.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.255
Okay. I'll instigate. In the meantime,
we need to find a replacement for Dee.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.466
We need a replacement. No! No, no, no, no, no!
That's not fair, you guys.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.385
Don't replace me!
You're being replaced.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.428
Okay. I'll tell you what, Dee.
If you can prove to us...

05:04.513 --> 05:07.556
that you can flip 10 cups in a row
under pressure, you're back on the team.

05:07.683 --> 05:09.892
Yes! Okay, I gotta practice.
That's all I need. All right.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.603
I gotta warm up. You see, I went into this cold.
I came in here cold.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.272
That's what my problem was.
One mistake and you're off the team.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.233
That oughta keep her busy
for at least a week or so.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.360
I don't think she'll ever get that.
Okay, in the meantime,

05:19.486 --> 05:21.737
let's find a replacement. Yes.
And I know just the place to go.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.824
Where? Same place I learned to
hone my God-given flip cup skills.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.077
The Delta Omega Lambda
fraternity house at Penn. Wait.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.288
That was, like, 15 years ago.
I don't think you'd have any clout there.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.041
It doesn't matter, man. I was the king of that place.
I'm a legend over there.

05:43.719 --> 05:48.347
Oh. This brings me back.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.267
Got the alumni's up here. Nice.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.146
[Chuckles] Oh, man.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.899
This is the class.
Oh, man. There's Ritter.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.986
Oh, that's- "I chug dick"? No.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.740
What? I never-
I don't chug dick. That's crazy.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.241
Why would you even put-
That's not funny.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.996
Come on, that's homophobic.
I mean, come on. What the hell?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.081
Bitch!
Pick it back up!

06:14.166 --> 06:16.792
[Man]
No, shake the ass! Shake the ass!

06:16.877 --> 06:19.628
[All Shouting]
Yeah, there you go!

06:19.713 --> 06:23.883
- Like this! - Frank?
What the hell are you doing, man?

06:23.967 --> 06:27.553
I'm recruiting these guys for the flip cup thing.
I almost got this, Dennis.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.264
Whoo-whoo-whoo!
Yeah!

06:30.390 --> 06:32.683
All right!
That's real funny shit, Frank!

06:32.768 --> 06:36.062
Step out for a second and let me handle this.
All right, guys- [Laughs]

06:36.146 --> 06:38.397
I'm Brother Reynolds, class of '98.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.858
Dude, we were cruising
in sixth grade in '98, man.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.736
Oh, sixth grade? Cool, man.
Well, I guess I kind of blazed the trail...

06:43.820 --> 06:46.197
for these sorts of shenanigans
you guys got going on in here.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.241
- What's going on with this kid?
- Oh, he's a pledge.

06:49.326 --> 06:53.079
And we're zapping his nuts
with a stun gun every couple of hours.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.247
- Oh!
- Look at him, man!

06:55.332 --> 06:57.917
That's brutal, man. Wow.
Let me- Let me get in on that.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.418
You- You want to get in on this?
Yeah.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.796
I'm sort of a legend when it
comes to this kind of shit. So, yeah.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.716
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Cool.
Here, man. - [All Laughing]

07:05.801 --> 07:08.803
- Down he goes!
- Oh, shit! That really hurts!

07:08.887 --> 07:13.015
Dennis, these guys are badass shitheads!
Oh, man! You got any ludes?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.726
Ludes? I don't think they
make those anymore, man. No?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.686
We got Ritarall.
Ritarall?

07:17.813 --> 07:22.358
Yeah. What's Ritarall?
Oh, snortski. Ohh. Mmm.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.278
[Inhales]
Ooh! Ooh, that's tasty stuff.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.322
Uh, God.
Zap him again.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.199
Huh?
[Screams]

07:30.283 --> 07:34.120
- It's that- It's that easy.
- Don't do that shit again, you little idiot!

07:34.204 --> 07:38.791
Okay? Have some respect for a brother,
okay? I'm a legend around this place.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.586
So don't zap me again! All right, listen.
I came here for a reason, okay?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.880
I came here to recruit you
for a flip cup tournament.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.425
Flip cup? Flip cup? What are you, a freshman?
That is so lame.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.636
Take a look at how loose his jeans are.
Okay. Okay.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.430
- [Screaming]
- Let me have it a minute.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.851
[Screaming] No more zapping.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.686
All right, all right.
No more zapping.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.397
We're done.
[Dennis] Stop, stop, stop!

08:01.523 --> 08:04.441
[Screaming] [Frank] Get outta here!

08:07.279 --> 08:09.363
[Dee]
All right, focus. You can do this.

08:11.908 --> 08:15.452
One more time, just- Oh, Dee.
Dee, it's getting hard to watch.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.955
Really.
I can't stop grinding my teeth.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.333
I don't know how these kids
study on this goddamn Ritarall.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.586
Yeah, I don't know either!
And I don't give a shit!

08:23.712 --> 08:25.379
Hey. So how did the recruiting go?
Oh, it was bad.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.258
We both got punked. Yeah, we both got
punked, Frank. We both got punked!

08:29.384 --> 08:30.968
That's right. These kids these
days, I'll tell you what.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.345
They're nothing like we used to be
back when we were in fraternities.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.390
They have no respect for anybody, okay?
They're like stupid little goddamn savages.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.142
They're bitches!
They're bitches! They're little bitches.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.352
I came in there, right?
And I was polite, and I was nice to them.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.063
I was cordial. And they completely
goddamn disrespected me!

08:43.148 --> 08:44.732
Little idiots! Idiots!
Yeah.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.860
I was completely respectful.
They're supposed to be my brothers, right?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.820
They're my brothers?
No, no. That's not fun.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.364
What they were doing wasn't fun.
They kept zapping us and zapping us.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.408
Idiots! Savages! Idiots!
No, zap, zap, zap, zap.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.786
Idiots! Jesus Christ, dude.
Calm down.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.496
Man, that's-
All right, I'm just...

08:59.581 --> 09:02.333
They disrespect-
I am a legend over there!

09:02.417 --> 09:04.668
I know you're a legend.
Charlie knows you're a legend, you know?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.253
Yeah. That's just the
viciousness of youth.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.505
That wasn't fun!
It's not fun! It's not fun!

09:08.632 --> 09:10.591
Savages!
I'll tell you what, dude.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.093
Maybe you should step down
from the fraternity thing.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.512
Look, we haven't gotten Art Sloan to sign up yet.
He has not signed up.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.514
Why don't you focus some
of that weird rage on him?

09:17.599 --> 09:20.142
- Charlie and I'll handle the frat
kids from here, okay? - Yeah, yeah.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.186
I'll totally pull
a Good Will Hunting on those kids...

09:22.312 --> 09:25.022
and that'll put 'em in their place.
How are you gonna do that?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.066
Well, you've seen the movie, right?
Yeah.

09:27.150 --> 09:31.862
So all I gotta do is I'll ask them some
like big shot, like, math or science,

09:31.947 --> 09:33.864
history-type college question...

09:33.949 --> 09:37.159
and then I'll totally stump them by knowing
a lot more about the answer than they do.

09:37.285 --> 09:42.081
Yeah, in that movie, Matt Damon played a
genius janitor. You're just a janitor.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.751
Right.
[Chuckles]

09:46.753 --> 09:48.712
You stumped me with that one.
That's a good point.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.714
You didn't have a comeback for that.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.716
How are you gonna have
a comeback in the frat house?

09:52.801 --> 09:55.594
Then you ask them the math
or history-type question...

09:55.720 --> 09:59.056
Ah, but you're not a janitor.
Don't do that.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.767
Just, please, please take care
of those little savages. Got it.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.395
Don't do that. Don't do that.
It'll work if you just say some lines from the movie.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.648
It works. Flip. That's too big.
That's too big.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.942
[Chattering]

10:10.026 --> 10:13.112
## [Techno]

10:13.238 --> 10:15.572
Oh!
Oh, my.

10:15.699 --> 10:19.159
What is going on in here, dude?
Oh, my.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.412
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Jesus Christ.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.539
It's like some kind of paint party.
Yeah!

10:23.665 --> 10:26.083
They're painting each other up!
Is this what college is like, man?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.127
I don't know, man.
I wish I went to college.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.047
I feel like I got boned big-time, dude!
Jesus Christ. Hey.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.383
Oh, my God, yo!
You're painting him?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.385
Hey!
That's nice.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.345
Yeah!
Jesus Christ, Charlie.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.222
Oh, my God, dude. Oh, my God.
They're painting each other.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.391
No! No, no, no! Charlie!
Stay focused, dude. Right!

10:42.517 --> 10:44.393
Stay focused. We gotta find guys for the team.
Right, right, right!

10:44.519 --> 10:46.812
Nothing will distract us. Nothing!
Okay. Do not get distracted.

10:46.938 --> 10:51.025
[Together] Hey!
[Together] Hi!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.485
Do you want to paint us up?
Yes.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.447
Uh, paint you up? How?
Yes.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.782
Well, first we paint you,
and then you paint us.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.993
Well, that makes sense.
Sure.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.287
Yeah, uh-
Yeah. Yeah.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.497
How do we do the painting?

11:05.582 --> 11:08.500
[Laughs] With our hands.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.002
We do.
Yeah.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.420
Yeah, we do.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.172
[Laughing] Awesome.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.133
Sorry. Excuse us.
Uh, are you ready?

11:16.217 --> 11:18.177
Yeah. No, we're ready.
We're ready.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.263
[Frank] Artie Sloan.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.015
Tying his shirts in knots!

11:23.099 --> 11:27.353
I like to humiliate guys, sure.
I'm no different than those guys are now, man.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.688
Yeah! You know?
Like, I used to be the same way.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.817
I used to dress guys up like bananas
and walk them around the quad.

11:33.902 --> 11:37.488
Or I'd take a banana and stick it up some
guy's ass in front of his best friend.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.699
And I'd be like,
"Hey! Banana ass! How you doing?"

11:40.784 --> 11:44.078
Or maybe I'd, like, uh-
I'd like take the tip of my penis...

11:44.162 --> 11:47.039
and stick it in a guy's mouth for, like,
just a second, you know what I mean?

11:47.123 --> 11:51.085
Like while he was sleeping.
[Laughing] I'm all about that shit!

11:51.169 --> 11:55.464
You know what I mean? But you don't stun
gun a guy who was a goddamn legend!

11:55.590 --> 11:58.175
No! And those guys, they
need to recognize that shit!

11:58.259 --> 12:00.803
I was a- I was a trailblazer!

12:00.887 --> 12:04.640
But these kids these days in fraternities,
it's like they don't have any respect.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.850
They don't care about anybody
but themselves, you know?

12:06.935 --> 12:09.686
And I don't understand that. It's like
they live in a fantasy world, where,

12:09.771 --> 12:12.689
"Oh, no. There's no consequences
for my actions.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.650
"I can do whatever the hell I want!

12:14.776 --> 12:17.194
And treat people however the hell
I want to treat 'em!" [Flushes]

12:17.278 --> 12:19.863
And I don't get that.
What are you doing, Frank? What is that?

12:19.948 --> 12:23.492
Well, what I'm doing is I'm cutting the
shower curtain in half waist high...

12:23.576 --> 12:27.704
so that when he's in using it,
people can see his junk.

12:27.831 --> 12:31.583
Wow, Frank. That Ritarall's having a very
interesting affect on what you think.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.669
I love this feeling!
Yeah!

12:33.795 --> 12:36.088
Got any more of it?
Does a bear shit in the woods?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.590
Well, cut up a couple of rails, buddy!
I'm gonna blast off!

12:38.675 --> 12:41.552
All right. Here you go.
All right.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.762
[Dennis] Let's do this!

12:46.307 --> 12:49.059
And we're done!
[Charlie and Mac] Ohh!

12:49.144 --> 12:51.061
[Laughing]

12:51.146 --> 12:53.939
That was awesome.
Oh, that's so awesome.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.775
That's so awesome.
And now you do us.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.236
Oh, man!
Yeah.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.821
And then for the best part.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.407
There's a better part than this?
There can't be a better part.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.825
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.994
When we shower together
and wash each other off.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.454
Yeah, we do. Whoo!
[Chuckles]

13:08.538 --> 13:10.038
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.707
What do you two clowns think you're doing?
That's awesome.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.918
Nah, it's cool, man. We're good.
We're good. No! You assholes gotta go!

13:15.003 --> 13:16.211
No, man.
Come on.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.213
Yeah, man. Yeah, you do.
You do, man. You do.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.756
Come on, man.
Hey. Hey, guys.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.967
I'm telling you no, dude.
I'm telling you no. Guys. Guys. Guys.

13:22.093 --> 13:25.679
We're trying to have a conversation, please.
No! You're not in the frat.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.222
Get out!
Guys, you're killing me.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.682
I'm gonna pull a Good Will Hunting.
No, no, Charlie.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.059
What's your major, dude?
Economics.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.520
Oh! Bet you're reading
a lot of Gordon Wood, huh!

13:33.605 --> 13:36.648
You read your Gordon Wood
and you regurgitate it from a textbook...

13:36.733 --> 13:38.817
and you think you're wicked
awesome doing that!

13:38.902 --> 13:42.112
And how about them apples?
And all that Gordon Wood business!

13:42.238 --> 13:45.282
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You are an idiot.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.619
You are an idiot.
Does no one know who Gordon Wood is?

13:48.703 --> 13:50.662
You know what, Cheesefoot?
Go get the stun gun.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.748
That's a great idea.
That's a great idea.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.919
Shit.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.004
[Both Sighing]

13:59.088 --> 14:01.298
[Crickets Chirping]

14:01.424 --> 14:03.342
[Frank] Oh, yeah!
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank! Dude!

14:03.468 --> 14:06.094
I'm finished!
Oh, yeah!

14:06.179 --> 14:08.263
I'm finished. What are you doing?
What do you got going on?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.432
What are you doing?
I'm doing this jerk-off's taxes!

14:10.517 --> 14:13.185
Next year the I.R.S. Will
audit the piss out of him!

14:13.269 --> 14:17.272
Oh! That's so weird! That's so-
That's long-term shit. I would- Yes!

14:17.398 --> 14:19.316
I like that! I like that!
Yes. Good.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.027
Do me a favor, man. Can you go
upstairs and look down onto the lawn?

14:22.111 --> 14:23.987
I've done it. I've done it.
I've done something.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.781
You've done it? Yeah.
Give me the cigar. I need that.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.491
What'd you do?
I have done "it."

14:27.575 --> 14:30.077
What?

14:30.161 --> 14:32.579
[Exhales]

14:32.664 --> 14:35.666
I've created a masterpiece.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.424
[Frank] Wow.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.972
I think our work here is done.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.193
It's so unfair, dude.
Oh, yeah, dude.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.862
So unfair!
I mean, like,

15:05.947 --> 15:08.949
if I had known college
was anything like that,

15:09.075 --> 15:14.746
the amount of book learning I would have
put to my brain- Read! And math, dude!

15:14.831 --> 15:16.748
To get there and stay there.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.792
They shower together!
And naked.

15:18.876 --> 15:23.088
Oh! Boom! The rivalry's back on, boys!
It is back on!

15:23.172 --> 15:26.049
The rivalry's back on?
Oh, yeah! It's back on!

15:26.134 --> 15:28.427
All right! Rivalry! Rivalry.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.763
[All] Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry.
Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.726
[Sighs]
Goddamn it. This feels forced. I...

15:35.852 --> 15:37.728
I'm not into it.
I'm definitely forcing it.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.439
Why is that? Something's off!
Something's off, dude!

15:40.523 --> 15:43.233
You know what it is for me?
I can only speak for myself.

15:43.318 --> 15:47.070
But it's those goddamn punk-ass frat kids, man.
They got to me, dude.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.489
They really got to me!
They burned me and I haven't let it go.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.826
Dude! They burned us too, man!
Did they burn you guys?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.786
- Is that why you're painted like that?
- Yeah, what's going on?

15:54.912 --> 15:57.998
They have like this magical thing going on.
Things are different now.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.460
Hey, you guys. Watch this.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.463
Oh!

16:04.589 --> 16:06.340
Hey!
Oh! Oh!

16:06.424 --> 16:08.300
Ohh!
Ohh!

16:08.384 --> 16:10.218
Oh!

16:10.303 --> 16:13.263
[Cheering]

16:13.348 --> 16:15.265
Ten in a row!
Nice!

16:15.350 --> 16:17.309
With everybody watching!
This guy! This guy!

16:17.393 --> 16:19.311
Holy shit!
That was amazing, Dee!

16:19.395 --> 16:21.313
And you just gave me
a thought, okay?

16:21.397 --> 16:24.483
- I think we need to rethink who our rivals are.
- What do you mean?

16:24.567 --> 16:27.611
Well, bro, the Art Sloan-Molly's
rivalry, that's, like, 10 years old!

16:27.695 --> 16:31.156
That's old shit, man! I think our new
rivals are those punk-ass frat kids!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.784
- Dude, those guys are dicks.
- They're such dicks, man!

16:33.868 --> 16:35.786
And I think with Dee's
newfound flip cup skills,

16:35.870 --> 16:38.121
we can embarrass
the shit out of those little bitches!

16:38.206 --> 16:40.415
I'll tell you what. I will take any
excuse to get back to that party.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.877
Okay! That's it! It's a rivalry!
The new rivalry!

16:43.961 --> 16:45.671
## [Techno]

16:47.632 --> 16:50.300
- What do you guys want?
- We want one game of flip cup.

16:50.385 --> 16:55.097
If you guys win, you get
to drink at our bar forever, for free.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.016
If we win, we get to come to
your frat whenever we want.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.852
- [Charlie] And paint girls!
- And get painted by them!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.896
And take showers with them!
Lots of showers.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.732
Okay. You're on.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.734
All right. These guys
are gonna be really fast.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.195
So we need to get on to a quick lead.
Dee, I want you to start us off.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.490
Really? Yes. Charlie, you're gonna
take us home as the anchor.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.866
Naturally.
All right.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.911
Oh, you guys. You guys,
I am not gonna let you down, okay?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.204
I know you're not, Sis. I'm proud of you.
We're really proud of you.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.082
Frank, you want to start us
of with some kind of cheer?

17:22.165 --> 17:24.084
Yeah, that's a good idea.

17:24.167 --> 17:27.295
Paddy's! Paddy's! Paddy's!

17:27.380 --> 17:30.006
Yeah!
Whoo!

17:30.091 --> 17:32.259
All right! All right!

17:32.343 --> 17:35.178
Okay, both teams ready?
Yeah!

17:35.263 --> 17:37.514
Go!
Go, Dee! Go, Dee! Go, Dee!

17:37.598 --> 17:40.559
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Come on, Dee!

17:40.643 --> 17:43.061
Come on! Don't think so hard!
Don't think so hard!

17:43.146 --> 17:45.480
- Hold on!
- [Charlie] Come on, Dee! Let's go!

17:45.565 --> 17:47.566
[Dennis]
Come on! Come on, Dee!

17:47.650 --> 17:50.736
Come on, Dee!
Ease up on it, Dee! Ease up!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.863
[Mac] Too hard! You're hitting
yourself in the head.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.740
Come on, Dee! What are you doing, Dee?
What are you doing?

17:54.824 --> 17:56.616
Oh, come on! Come on! Dee!

17:56.743 --> 17:58.702
Come on, Dee!
[Cheering]

17:58.786 --> 18:01.288
No!

18:02.623 --> 18:07.252
- Your beer, free for us, for life!
- For life!

18:07.336 --> 18:11.047
You guys, I'm sorry.
You guys, one more time.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.008
Let's just challenge them to one more!
You know what I mean?

18:13.134 --> 18:16.261
I feel like we could really get these guys!
Don't you see, Dee?

18:16.345 --> 18:20.223
- We've already won.
- [Laughing]

18:20.308 --> 18:22.267
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

18:22.351 --> 18:25.479
Ohh! Oh, God.
[Stomach Gurgling]

18:25.563 --> 18:28.523
Hey, what- Whoa.
What's going on with me?

18:28.608 --> 18:32.068
Oh, what's going on is that
you just drank a cup of poison!

18:32.153 --> 18:34.863
[All Shouting]

18:34.989 --> 18:36.948
Paddy's Pub, bitches!
[Stomachs Gurgling]

18:37.033 --> 18:39.743
- You guys poisoned the beer?
- Yes, Dee, we did poison the beer.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.661
That was the only way we could
beat these little bitches!

18:41.746 --> 18:45.373
I thought you guys believed in me.
You were so proud of me.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.833
Oh, no.
We knew you were gonna choke.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.002
Yeah. Yeah. We knew you'd pretty
much choke under pressure.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.296
Which is why-
We poisoned your ass!

18:51.380 --> 18:53.089
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

18:53.174 --> 18:55.091
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

18:55.176 --> 18:57.135
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

18:57.220 --> 19:01.264
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!
Flip, Flipadelphia!

19:01.349 --> 19:03.266
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

19:03.351 --> 19:05.477
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

19:10.900 --> 19:13.193
[Frank]
Pull! Yank!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.862
Rip 'em off!
Pull 'em of! Yank em! Yank 'em!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.864
They're not coming off!
Yank 'em! Yank 'em!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.908
We're gonna have to burn
'em off, I think. No!

19:19.992 --> 19:22.244
Gotta get 'em off
'cause I got no circulation in my legs.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.913
Yeah, I don't know.
You've got to be kidding me.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.791
Whoa-ho. Hey, hey, pump your brakes there, pal.
Slow down for a second.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.335
What- What's your problem exactly?
What- What's my problem?

19:30.419 --> 19:35.257
Okay, you know what? You disrespected my business.
You vandalized my home.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.342
All in the name of some
stupid drinking competition.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.345
And then when I finally cave in,
you don't even show up.

19:40.471 --> 19:44.808
Show up for what?
Well... Flipadelphia!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.434
Oh, Flipadelphia!
Oh, sh...

19:46.561 --> 19:47.894
Was that today?
Yeah, dude.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.522
Okay, you know what?
I want a challenge. Okay?

19:50.606 --> 19:54.734
My bar. Flip cup. Today. Let's go!

19:54.861 --> 19:56.903
Nah. We've moved on.
Yeah, I'm over it.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.614
You know what?
That's gonna be a pass for me too.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.658
Yeah. I don't feel well at all.
They poisoned me.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.120
I'm not feeling it either.
So that's gonna be a unanimous no from us.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.330
Sorry.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.416
God!

20:12.336 --> 20:13.712
- Hey, now.
- Come on, man.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.463
What was that?
Totally uncalled for.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.799
- Who slams a door?
- Babies.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.303
That guy's got some real growing up to do.
I mean, have some respect, for Christ's sake.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.722
Goddamn savage.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.765
I am a legend.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.603
