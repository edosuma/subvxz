00:01.102 --> 00:04.083
Thank you for flying JetBlue.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.584
- Here you go, here you go.
- That was quick.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.450
You skip the line
when you're on the Excelsior level.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.150
- Oh.
- Three rooms adjoining, top floor.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.318
- Oh.
- Silver. Pretty.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.623
Platinum, so don't
wave that around everywhere.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.460
People get jealous.
Maybe wave it around a little.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.723
My friend Burt Tanner runs the hotel.

00:22.790 --> 00:27.170
He comped us a few rooms because we sold him
some closets for his high-roller suites.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.970
Zebrawood, heated sock drawer,
the works.

00:30.031 --> 00:33.274
Hey, luxury bathroom.
It's me, lowly closet.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.109
Watch your back.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.615
- Mitchell?
- Langham?

00:37.671 --> 00:39.776
Hey, Cam, it's Langham and Tim!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.080
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:41.142 --> 00:43.019
What are you boys doing here?

00:43.077 --> 00:46.286
- Bachelor party weekend. We're getting married in June.
- What?

00:46.347 --> 00:49.794
We really wanted to invite you,
but Tim's family is huge.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.160
Relax. We're getting married in May,
and you're not coming, so-

00:52.219 --> 00:53.425
Mitchell!

00:53.487 --> 00:55.160
Oh, look at us moving on.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.259
It's almost like
you never dumped me in an e-mail...

00:57.324 --> 00:59.133
the morning after I told you
that I loved you.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.935
- Well, in my defense, e-mail- it was new back then-
- Oh.

01:01.996 --> 01:04.476
There was still a blurry line
as to what was appropriate and-

01:04.532 --> 01:06.705
Well, we have a pretty packed weekend.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.010
Oh, we do, but if you guys have some time,
here's our itinerary.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.448
- Okay.
- Come play.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.643
- Oh, yeah.
- Fun.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.083
- You guys, congratulations.
- Bye.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.347
Thank you.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.480
- Oh, my gosh, an actual gay agenda.
- Geez.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.819
Ooh. Come on.

01:18.879 --> 01:22.019
Looks like we're not gonna
see much of you two this trip.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.654
No, no. We are not participating
in any of this.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.493
They're very judgy
about bachelor parties.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.194
I offered to throw them one,
and I got a whole lecture.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.634
We're 40. We have a child.
We've been together for 10 years.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.138
- That's the one.
- It's just not who we are anymore.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.142
Listen to this-
"Bananas in Cabanas Pool Party."

01:37.198 --> 01:39.701
"Most creative Speedo...

01:39.767 --> 01:41.872
- wins tickets to The Kilty Pleasures."
- No.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.847
- Please.
- What is The Kilty Pleasures?

01:43.904 --> 01:45.212
This.

01:45.272 --> 01:49.311
We will be maintaining our dignity
in the spa, thank you.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.926
I mean, come on. Have you ever seen
a Scottish person this tan?

01:54.982 --> 01:56.825
I'm embarrassed even looking at it.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.386
Then stop.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.530
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:01.589 --> 02:03.626
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:03.691 --> 02:05.728
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:05.793 --> 02:07.704
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:07.761 --> 02:08.933
♪ Hey,♪♪

02:11.332 --> 02:13.608
Whoa. That warmer drawer really works.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.874
It's like my mom's
hugging my feet again.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.780
- I'm gonna go do some shopping.
- Oh, well, maybe we'll catch up later.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.841
No. You have your day, I'll have mine.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.946
- Well, how 'bout the bar at, like, 5:00?
- Sure.

02:24.011 --> 02:27.254
She was icing me, but I deserved it.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.885
For the first time in my whole life,
I was neglecting her.

02:29.950 --> 02:33.591
I'd been invited to audition
for a secret magic society in Las Vegas.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.930
But in all my rehearsals,
I'd paid no attention to Claire.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.765
I even left her alone
in a movie theater once.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.806
Oh, no.

02:40.861 --> 02:45.606
I let Phil think I was still mad at him
because I needed a little time to myself.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.074
Come to mama! Yeah!

02:49.136 --> 02:53.414
Years ago, Phil and I put aside money
for a trip on our 25th anniversary...

02:53.474 --> 02:56.512
but I lost that money
on a girls' weekend in Vegas.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.558
Since then, I've been on a secret mission
to win that money back...

02:59.613 --> 03:03.584
and if things go well this weekend,
I am even.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.393
Vegas, you have a gambling problem...

03:06.453 --> 03:08.057
and her name is Claire.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.264
Knockity knock, knock.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.999
Mr. Dunphy, I presume?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.335
Yes. Who- Hi.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.137
I'm Leslie Higgins.
It's a boy's name where I'm from.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.075
- I'm your butler.
- Oh, butler. Cool.

03:19.133 --> 03:22.478
Yes. As an Excelsior guest,
I'm at your beck and call 24-7.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.540
- Anything you need, big or small, I can-
- Oh.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.821
Can I just segue, sir,
to the importance of discretion in my job?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.789
- I'll just pop those-
- Oh, no, no, no. Never mind those.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.553
- As you wish.
- They're for an appointment I have later.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.958
The less you know about that,
the better.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.792
A myriad of apologies, sir.
If there's nothing else-

03:38.852 --> 03:41.332
Oh, hang on. Actually, do you know
where I can get a cape laundered?

03:41.388 --> 03:43.265
- Opera or superhero?
- I'd rather not say.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.826
I overstepped the mark by asking.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.339
Uh, could I just quickly point out
our luxury bath service, sir?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.500
We have five
outrageously decadent baths...

03:50.564 --> 03:52.475
that I can prepare for you
at a moment's notice.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.944
Uh, I should just point out, though...

03:54.001 --> 03:56.379
that our Pharaoh's Fantasy
does take a dash longer normally...

03:56.437 --> 03:58.417
because our Nubian lives off-site.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.715
- If there's nothing else, I'll just help you with your-
- No, uh-

04:04.645 --> 04:06.181
- I'll get that.
- Yep, yep.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.453
Ah, thank you.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.755
- I love cucumber water.
- I know.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.763
- If I were president-
- I know, I know.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.765
Cucumbers in the reservoirs.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.698
- Giant cucumbers.
- Mmm.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.928
- Mr. Pritchett?
- Yes, hi.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.493
All right, I'll see you in 90 minutes.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.833
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.542
Mr. Tucker?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.475
Mr. Tucker?

04:34.642 --> 04:37.316
We had a few no-shows
for the Britney concert, so-

04:37.378 --> 04:39.255
One, please.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.519
Oh. What about Mitchell?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.686
It's Vegas.
He doesn't need to know what I'm doing.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.252
I don't need to know what he's doing.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.821
So if you see him,
maybe don't mention what I'm doing.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.094
Oh. Understood.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.500
So do you have anything on the aisle?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.172
Yeah?

04:55.229 --> 04:57.140
Rasputin's Dalmatian
drowned in the Volga.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.505
I thought he was allergic to dogs.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.169
You're thinking of Merlin,
and it was peanuts.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.511
Okay, everybody. We have a visitor.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.052
Welcome Phil Dunphy.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.280
- Hi.
- Hey, Phil.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.515
Hey.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.250
I'm so honored to be here.

05:12.313 --> 05:17.262
Wow. You may recognize my-
my screen name, abracadunphyl7.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.730
That's you?
You're up in the middle of the night a lot.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.266
My wife grinds her teeth.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.598
But let me tell you another story.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.762
It's about the miracle of metamorphosis.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.636
- Uh, Phil-
- They say the only constant is change-

05:28.696 --> 05:30.607
Phil, we're gonna get to your trick
in just a minute.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.337
Oh. I'm sorry.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.606
Got a little excited there.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.308
The heroes of the underground
magic blogosphere-

05:37.371 --> 05:42.184
Flashpaper Finelli,
Kaiser Mayhem, The Kid!

05:42.242 --> 05:45.815
When you think about it,
it's crazy they're all alive at the same time.

05:47.314 --> 05:50.386
Jay, I'm feeling a little cold.
Maybe I should buy a scarf.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.988
Sure, get a couple of 'em.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.829
Why, I know it's a little extravagant...

05:55.889 --> 05:58.597
but we're Excelsior now-
might as well look it.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.866
Many years ago,
when Jay was in Las Vegas...

06:00.928 --> 06:04.705
he bought Barkley, the doggie butler.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.244
I hate Barkley.

06:06.300 --> 06:10.009
I knew if Jay saw Rebarka,
he would want her too.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.846
Yeah, that's her name- Rebarka.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.580
Yeah, but, uh- you know,
if we're going to gamble...

06:15.642 --> 06:17.315
maybe I need my lucky sweater.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.449
Can you go and get it in the room?

06:19.513 --> 06:23.325
- Who has a lucky sweater?
- You wore two different shoes to watch the Super Bowl.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.796
- Fine.
- No, Jay!

06:25.853 --> 06:27.696
Other way.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.996
I like that way.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.794
Sorry, sir. This is a private elevator.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.899
No need to apologize.
I'm glad you're on top of this stuff.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.569
That's only for the Excelsior level.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.010
This elevator goes to the top floor.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.174
I thought Excelsior was the top- 62.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.081
Mandalay Bay has 63 floors.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.586
Top floor is Excelsior Plus.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.618
Wait, they're allowed up there?
They're wearing dungarees.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.888
Sixty-one, 62, 63.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.326
Son of a bitch!

07:00.487 --> 07:01.989
Come on, let me see an eight.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.797
- I wanna see an eight.
- Seven out.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.997
- Sorry.
- We'll get 'em next time, baby.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.439
Claire, give me your key.
I need to charge something to your room.

07:10.497 --> 07:13.535
- Hang on a second.
- Four. Point is four.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.242
Okay, odds on four,
and a five each on "C" and "E."

07:18.305 --> 07:19.716
What are you talking about?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.946
It's the lady version of Barkley.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.821
I have to put it on hold so that Jay,
if he sees it, he can't buy it...

07:25.879 --> 07:28.655
and then I will cancel the charge
before we leave.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.353
Winner- four the hard way!

07:30.417 --> 07:32.693
Oh, yes! Finally!

07:33.720 --> 07:35.290
Claire, the key.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.335
Oh, no, honey.
You're not going anywhere.

07:37.391 --> 07:39.064
You're my good luck charm.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.504
Give these a blow, beautiful.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.242
Oh. How was your massage?

07:49.303 --> 07:51.874
So re-
So, so relaxing.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.850
Sorry, my masseuse
was blasting the Enya.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.251
So what are you gonna do next?
A long soak?

07:56.310 --> 07:58.415
- A long sauna?
- I think a sauna.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.925
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna do a soak.
- Ooh, a soak does sound nice.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.019
- Maybe I'll do a sauna.
- Is that- Is that glitter on your face?

08:04.084 --> 08:07.554
Oh. Yeah, I think my masseuse
might moonlight.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.123
Vegas.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.362
- I'll see you in an hour.
- Okay. Enjoy it. Really have fun.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.132
Relax, Mitchell.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.532
Phil, you're up.

08:16.597 --> 08:20.443
Okay. The miracle... of metamorphosis.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.539
They say the only constant is change.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.313
Well, all of that is about to ch-
be different.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.145
Note the simple burlap sack,
the kind you'd find in any home.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.886
If you'd be so kind as to assist me,
The- The Kid...

08:35.948 --> 08:39.328
I'll endeavor to prove
that some change is glacial...

08:39.385 --> 08:42.525
while some change is instantaneous.

08:42.589 --> 08:46.901
Now if you'd be so kind as to raise
the simple burlap sack above my head...

08:46.960 --> 08:48.769
and pinch my wrists.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.404
You'll note the clock says exactly 4:02.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.877
I have 3:15.

08:53.934 --> 08:57.177
Yeah, I have 6:35. Kaiser Mayhem!

08:57.237 --> 08:58.443
It's what I do.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.507
Wait, it's 5:20?
I actually have to call my wife.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.747
Uh, no, Phil. You can't just stop
in the middle of a trick.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.789
- That's a cardinal rule.
- Guys, it's an emergency.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.654
Don't tell me
you've never had to call your spouse.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.753
Oh, there's- there's people for you.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.593
Come on, Claire. Please pick up.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.463
And the lady wins again.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.128
Yes! Yes!
I did it. I did it.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.693
I did it. I won back my money.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.001
Oh, suck it, the house.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.735
Claire, the key.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.939
Yeah, okay, here you go.
And, hey, buy yourself something sparkly.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.050
- Gloria, there's a floor above us.
- What?

09:34.107 --> 09:36.553
I know. it threw me too.
Excelsior Plus.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.113
But to the people on that floor,
we're Excelsior Minus.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.591
- What is up there?
- You need a black card to get in.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.650
All we've got is this stupid silver one.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.196
Oh, I thought it was platinum.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.425
- It's crap.
- Uh, why-

09:47.487 --> 09:49.990
why don't you call your friend Burt...

09:50.057 --> 09:52.560
and tell him that we need
the black card?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.902
Because he's not my friend.
I never really even met him.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.306
I think I heard him cough
one time on a conference call.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.139
I don't know why
he would treat me this way.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.076
- Oh, come on!
- What?

10:01.134 --> 10:05.048
Oh, come on! You're Jay Pritchett.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.881
You're gonna find your friend Burt
and tell him who you are...

10:07.941 --> 10:09.477
and you're gonna get the black card.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.547
Because when you set your mind on something,
nobody can stop you!

10:12.613 --> 10:14.320
- Right!
- Wait!

10:14.381 --> 10:15.826
Go that way.

10:18.385 --> 10:22.060
Excuse me. How much is that doggie
in the window?

10:24.591 --> 10:27.094
I had finally taken back from Vegas...

10:27.160 --> 10:29.436
what Vegas took from me.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.739
That's a feeling of satisfaction
I can't describe-

10:32.799 --> 10:34.608
'cause it didn't last very long

10:34.668 --> 10:35.976
- Oh, hey, Claire.
- Yeah?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.413
- Have you seen Cam?
- No.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.281
Although we should stay in one place
so he can find us.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.115
How about a blackjack table?

10:42.175 --> 10:45.247
Oh, no, I'm really worn out
from my massage, the sauna.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.121
It was just- it was a lot of detoxing.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.387
You know what you need? Some toxing.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.089
- No.
- Hand of blackjack, couple of tequilas.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.291
Come on, it'll be fun. Do it.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.528
You sound just like the kid who bullied me
into smoking my first cigarette.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.298
Maybe this time you won't tell on me.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.565
- And then hit.
- Yes.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.573
And then hit. And then stay.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.609
- I know. I have it.
- Okay.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.008
Eighteen, 19, 18.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.205
You are in a great position right now.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.475
Oh, the dealer has 21 .

11:10.537 --> 11:12.983
Hers is better. I am so sorry, Mitchell.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.350
I promise you,
we did everything right. Don't be mad.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.513
- I'm not mad.
- Really?

11:16.576 --> 11:17.748
No, that was- that was thrilling.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.950
- I'm- My pulse is racing.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.890
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much for making me do this.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.450
I'm going to play another hand.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.191
- We're going to play another hand.
- No, alone. Not with you.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.960
- Really?
- You're bad luck. Go. Far.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.433
The minute I got rid of her,
I couldn't lose.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.663
Oh, gambling's fun.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.000
And easy.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.268
- Hey, big spender. What are you doing?
- Hey.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.309
Gambling. I'm a gambler now.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.470
- Look at you letting loose.
- Yeah.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.743
I guess I figure whatever mischief
one might get into in Vegas...

11:43.804 --> 11:46.808
kind of remains here
within the limits of the city, you know?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.477
- That's a cool way to think about it.
- Yeah.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.078
I'm really glad that you came over here.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.020
- Really? Why is that?
- Well, I always hated...

11:52.079 --> 11:54.025
the way that things ended
between us, you know?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.584
Maybe now we can go out
on a better note.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.357
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.022
Oh- Oh, my God!

12:00.087 --> 12:02.363
6-2-3-3- That's-That's my room number.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.368
Huh. Um, hit me.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.199
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven!

12:06.259 --> 12:09.331
That's 21 , huh? Yes! Yeah!

12:09.396 --> 12:12.240
- Ah!
- Whoa, check you out.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.336
I guess tonight's my night to get lucky.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.846
- I would say.
- My lady.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.178
- Thank you.
- Maybe I will run into you again, huh?

12:18.238 --> 12:21.685
Okay. it was good to see you. Oh, y-

12:26.646 --> 12:29.525
120, 140, Higgins- for nothing.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.360
Nothing! I want to do something crazy.
Okay, I'm gonna order a bath.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.900
Sir, it sounds to me
like you've gone mad.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.637
Okay, this is what I want. I want
something romantic, but also a little dangerous.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.834
Romantic, dangerous.
Might I suggest, sir, the Techno Bath?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.002
Your heart will throb with the bass...

12:46.066 --> 12:48.706
while your eyes take in
an off-the-scale laser light show...

12:48.769 --> 12:52.376
from that most intimate of V. I. P. arenas-
your own tub.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.544
Okay. I want that.
That's what I want.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.986
Methinks the Little Red Riding Hood...

12:57.043 --> 12:58.989
- may be a big, bad wolf.
- Oh!

12:59.045 --> 13:00.820
- I'll be back shortly with supplies.
- Okay!

13:00.881 --> 13:04.385
Ah, Mr. Dunphy! How are...

13:04.451 --> 13:06.158
we this evening?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.495
Not so good.
I'm in a tight spot with my lady.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.057
- Ah.
- You know what might help?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.194
One of those- one of those luxury baths.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.263
Ah, get yourself out of some hot water
by getting her into some.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.534
Wow, so good.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.337
Might I suggest the Michael Bublé Bath?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.571
- You are a mind reader.
- I'm not a mind reader, sir.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.080
I've just been in the bath buttling business
since the early '90s...

13:23.136 --> 13:25.912
despite my fresh face, so I tend to know
what these situations need.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.918
- I'll get the water going.
- As you wish.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.715
Same price either way.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.154
- Burt says he's gonna be here any minute.
- Mm-hmm.

13:32.212 --> 13:36.524
We got to really lay it on for this guy-
best scotch, put on something sexy.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.530
I... have a great idea!

13:39.586 --> 13:42.999
Cigars! A man like Burt appreciates
a good cigar.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.969
Good thinking! Of course, upstairs,
the butler would be here already.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.371
I'm telling you, we might as well be
sleeping in the basement.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.710
I said hold it, not deliver it!

13:53.767 --> 13:56.270
Ay. Okay, there.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.747
Come here.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.613
Stay in Claire's room.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.720
Hey, honey. I'm in the bathroom.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.957
Honey?

14:08.114 --> 14:10.560
Okay, I-I know I messed up,
but sit tight.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.960
I got a little surprise for you.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.793
Higgins, you got a minute?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.800
Sixty an hour.
They all belong to you, sir.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.166
I need a couple of primo cigars,
A.S.A. P.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.102
I'm not a stickler
for how they got in the country.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.766
I'm also expecting
a special scotch delivery.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.139
I need a shave.
Burt can't see me like this.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.802
Unfortunately,
the shaving butlers are all-

14:26.867 --> 14:27.937
I know- Excelsior Plus.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.571
Are you decent?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.343
- I am.
- Well, not for long.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.974
My partner should be here any minute.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.646
Is it me, sir, or is the air positively fizzing
with erotic anticipation?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.280
- Yeah.
- Oh, I forgot the ice.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.188
- I'm gonna get it.
- I couldn't ask you to do that.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.989
- Not a problem.
- As you wish. Same price either way.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.474
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm looking for Mitchell.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.670
Oh, yeah, he's expecting you. In fact,
he's asked me to draw the two of you a bath.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.180
Wow. This is crazy.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.874
Yeah. I believe that's the plan.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.944
Enjoy.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.351
Thank you.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.862
Oh, good. You're back.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.627
- How's Claire seem?
- I'm sorry?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.998
You must have seen her out there.
Is she mad? What's she doing?

15:25.525 --> 15:26.970
Uh, she's dusting, sir.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.132
Oh, she always cleans when she's mad.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.074
Do me a favor. Bring her a drink
and tell her to get comfortable on the couch.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.078
She's-She's allowed
on the furniture, is she?

15:36.303 --> 15:38.408
She's my wife.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.417
Oh, good! I've been looking for you.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.649
Well, you should have been looking for
somebody who was looking for you...

15:45.712 --> 15:47.350
because that's what I was doing.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.825
Come on, I have a surprise for you.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.887
- Oh.
- Yeah, I-I've been thinking.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.365
We need to stop being so uptight.
We are in Vegas.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.924
Let's have a little fun.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.663
I'll have to wrap my head around that,
but okay.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.204
I have just the way to kick it off-

16:00.260 --> 16:01.739
something we could do together.

16:01.795 --> 16:05.504
It's a little extreme, but I think
it might be just what we need.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.873
- Okay.
- Go on in.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.678
Are you crazy?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.412
Oh, come on, Cam. We deserve this.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.887
All right, you get started,
and then I'll jump in when it starts to heat up.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.857
- Mitchell!
- Come on. Then I will throw you into it, tiger.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.257
Rub-a-dub-dub.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.794
No!

16:23.850 --> 16:25.124
Langham.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.858
Both of you?

16:26.920 --> 16:30.561
- Huh. Well, okay.
- No, no. No, not okay. What are you doing here?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.432
- You gave me your room key.
- What?

16:32.492 --> 16:35.905
Don't act so shocked. You told me at
the bachelor party you two lead separate lives.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.305
You went to the bachelor party?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.708
Yes, and I was starting to feel bad
about sneaking around...

16:39.766 --> 16:42.440
but I guess I shouldn't have,
now that I see what you're up to.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.039
I'm not up to anything.
I left my key by mistake.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.517
We're all obviously tense.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.747
Let's take a deep breath...

16:49.809 --> 16:51.152
get in the tub-

16:51.211 --> 16:52.918
it's not happening.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.483
You want to tell me how you "accidentally"
gave someone your key?

16:56.549 --> 16:59.826
You want to tell me why you spent all day
sipping tequila out of some guy's navel?

16:59.886 --> 17:01.832
- You saw that?
- I guessed.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.060
Hi, guys. What's going on?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.432
Hey, Claire. Can you please come back?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.438
- We're in the middle of an argument.
- Bet I know why.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.633
Are you guys getting in the bath?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.767
Or I'm way off.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.539
- Langham!
- That's Tim. He can't know I'm here.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.104
- He has insane trust issues.
- Insane?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.672
Langham, are you in there?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.273
- Go out this door.
- In here.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.650
Gloria, hurry up, will you?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.483
He's on his way up.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.818
I need to shave.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.415
Oh, you're here.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.653
Jay Pritchett. Thanks for stopping by.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.923
Nice robe. Like Hef back in the day.

17:31.985 --> 17:34.659
I'm gonna cut to the chase.
I like your lifestyle.

17:34.721 --> 17:38.259
- I want a taste of it.
- Well- Sure, that's flattering, but-

17:38.324 --> 17:40.497
- Okay, the bathroom is-
- Gloria, it's Burt Tanner!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.767
That's not Burt Tanner. That's Long Ham.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.831
Langham!

17:45.765 --> 17:47.711
What's that thing doing here?

17:47.767 --> 17:50.680
Just enjoying a dirty martini
before a cleansing romp in the bath.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.216
That's not who the bath is for.

17:55.008 --> 17:58.546
Oh, my mistake. Welcome, Claire.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.182
You're certainly gonna be clean
by the end of the night, aren't you?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.922
Jay, I forgot all my hair products!

18:04.984 --> 18:06.793
I'm going to borrow from Claire.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.526
Okay, coast is clear.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.234
Eee! Ay.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.865
Hmm?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.000
Jay!

18:18.064 --> 18:19.304
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.208
Hey, Phil. There you are.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.076
Ducky. How'd you know where I was?

18:23.136 --> 18:25.514
- Magicians run this town.
- Really?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.279
No. I'm a shaving butler up on Plus.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.684
Look, I felt bad about
how things went down today...

18:29.742 --> 18:31.585
and I-I just wanted
to give you another shot.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.622
Right this way.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.595
I really think
you're gonna like what you see.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.756
Okay, let me just get everything set up.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.166
Metamorphosis.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.933
They say the only constant is change.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.270
I-i'm sorry, what- What is that?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.936
Oh, I don't even know.
It's something my wife bought.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.479
Let me just get rid of it. Here we go.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.379
Really, uh, rubbing it in
on that wife thing, huh?

19:00.206 --> 19:01.776
Metamorphosis.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.355
Burt!

19:04.410 --> 19:08.017
Nice of you to come down a floor
and see how the other half lives.

19:08.081 --> 19:12.120
If you will, raise it above my head
and pinch it at my wrists.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.187
Go ahead and make it good and tight.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.165
Don't be easy on me.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.793
- Okay.
- Now-

19:18.858 --> 19:23.466
As the lowly caterpillar
becomes the majestic butterfly...

19:23.530 --> 19:26.704
as the tiny acorn
becomes the mighty oak...

19:26.766 --> 19:30.646
so too do we complete our...

19:30.703 --> 19:32.649
metamorphosis!

19:32.705 --> 19:35.311
So it's the Governor's Bluff.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.616
Well, it's a huge twist
on the Governor's Bluff.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.815
Eh.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.653
No, no, no, no, no.
There were other elements.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.715
You just kind of threw me off.
I forgot. I was gonna-

19:42.782 --> 19:44.455
As a flourish I was gonna use one-

19:47.153 --> 19:48.564
Hola.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.464
That's amazing!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.901
Y-You lull me with this-
with this hacky quick change...

19:52.959 --> 19:55.166
and the whole time, you're changing
the fake dog into a hot maid?

19:55.228 --> 19:57.139
It's brilliant! it's magic!

19:57.197 --> 20:00.701
No, that's metamorphosis!

20:02.035 --> 20:04.709
Like you, Burt, I enjoy the finer things.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.479
As a matter of fact, that's probably
the Cuban I ordered for you.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.220
Hola.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.984
Cam, if you wanted a bachelor party,
you should have just said something.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.756
Well, I didn't know I wanted one
until we got here.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.889
And you're so "Eh, eh, eh,"
I-I was afraid to say anything.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.763
Okay, all right.
Lucky for the two of you...

20:22.822 --> 20:24.824
I know you better
than you know yourselves...

20:24.891 --> 20:28.896
and what the two of you need
is a little guilty pleasure.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.635
Or should I say-

20:33.900 --> 20:36.540
The Scotch delivery you had me
on the lookout for, sir.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.554
I like your style, Pritchett. You're in.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.754
Vegas.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.194
- This reminds me of my late grandfather.
- He was Scottish?

20:52.252 --> 20:53.663
- He was a stripper.
- Oh.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.666
There we go.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.363
You got the touch, kid.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.531
I was blessed with my mother's
small hands, sir.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.542
Shall I order your complimentary
in-room hot-stone massage?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.770
Complimentary?

21:06.833 --> 21:09.507
All part of the Excelsior Plus
experience, sir.

21:09.569 --> 21:12.413
Might be nice after a dip
in your private lap pool.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.543
Oh, where has this been all my life?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.019
You know, I saw a harpist in the elevator.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.249
Can we get that for our brunch tomorrow?

21:19.312 --> 21:21.417
If it was up to me, yes,
but unfortunately...

21:21.481 --> 21:25.861
that is reserved
for our Excelsior Ultra guests only.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.626
Sixty-two, 63, 64!

21:28.688 --> 21:30.429
Son of a bitch!
