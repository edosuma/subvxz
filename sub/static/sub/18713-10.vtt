00:00.010 --> 00:02.050
I want to be a pathologist, Nikki,

00:02.100 --> 00:04.370
.. but I have to go home.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.550
Luisa went somewhere she
should not have gone.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.030
Don't make the same mistake.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.710
This is my baby, Nesto.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.309
All these people have
been taken by the cartels?

00:16.360 --> 00:18.790
Where is Luisa? Where have they got them?

00:18.840 --> 00:20.430
If we give up, if we stop...

00:20.480 --> 00:21.830
They'd give them back.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.590
Ernesto, Luisa, the others?

00:23.640 --> 00:25.350
I'd give my life for him.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.870
Eva... Eva you're confused.
Nikki's at the compound.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.710
She was with me. She was here.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.720
Nikki!

01:00.880 --> 01:02.790
Why are you doing this?

01:02.840 --> 01:06.340
'You'll need your oxygen,
too, so stop screaming.'

01:06.520 --> 01:07.950
Get me out!

'Only take sips.'

01:22.800 --> 01:24.360

01:30.080 --> 01:31.750
Oh, Jack.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.230
What is it?

01:33.280 --> 01:35.040
Oh, no, think.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.200
0-7-5-1-7...

01:43.160 --> 01:45.840
I'm buried.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.480
Shit. Shit.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.640

02:54.440 --> 02:55.590
Tell me. Tell me again.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.160
I was driving. I looked over to
Nikki, she was falling asleep.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.400
We were on the road to
Santa Dominga and...

03:05.360 --> 03:07.240
Oh. Jet-lag.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.350
Sorry.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.430
Then what?

03:10.480 --> 03:12.150
I don't know.

03:15.710 --> 03:16.710
How's your head?

03:16.760 --> 03:20.760
He must have been hiding in
the back. He must have hit me.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.230
I shouldn't touch.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.020
It's your car, you're all over it.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.750
Yeah, we can get some fibres off this.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.630
Yes.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.070
And then what do we do with them?

03:50.120 --> 03:52.320
What else can I do, Eva?

03:57.440 --> 03:59.310
This is my fault.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.080
If I had stayed home with her.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.340
It hasn't been used since
midnight, before they left.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.150
It's hers?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.670
She's really gone, isn't she?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.310
Why take her?

04:29.360 --> 04:30.510
I don't know.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.700
Why take her, not Eva?

04:33.280 --> 04:34.630
I mean, Eva's the prize, isn't she?

04:34.680 --> 04:35.950
I don't know.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.800
Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe,
maybe they thought she was Eva.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.500
What do they want?

04:45.760 --> 04:49.860
- What do they want? I asked
you a question! - I don't know!

04:50.680 --> 04:52.390
They don't want you here.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.180
They don't want anyone to help us.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.310
That's better.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.270
See, you always find the right
thing to say in the end, don't you?

04:59.320 --> 05:00.750
How do you do it?

05:00.800 --> 05:05.310
Your childhood sweetheart is
kidnapped, murdered, God knows what.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.350
All this shit swirling around you

05:08.400 --> 05:10.790
and you walk through it untouched.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.030
- The eye of the storm.
- Really?

05:13.080 --> 05:15.590
- You know that, do you?
- No. Nobody does.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.710
Nobody knows you, not really.
You make sure of that.

05:18.760 --> 05:19.870
You're angry.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.070
What have I got to be angry about?

05:22.120 --> 05:25.670
Luisa's father, on the other
hand, I imagine he's very angry.

05:25.720 --> 05:30.400
I mean, you... you let her go
out there day after day, right?

05:31.360 --> 05:33.070
She called you that day.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.720
She needed you. Where were you?

05:37.560 --> 05:39.430
Did you love her?

05:40.080 --> 05:41.830
I mean, really?

05:41.880 --> 05:45.180
Or was she just another
member of the fan club?

05:49.560 --> 05:51.230
I'm sorry.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.620
No, no. I'm sorry for you.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.510
For Dr Alexander.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.430
She wanted to be a part of something.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.140
Now she is.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.230
No!

06:14.280 --> 06:17.310
650 by 850.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.390
Roughly 2,300. Oh, shit.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.720
So, 1,270 litres of air.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.430
Only 21% is oxygen.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.670
267 litres.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.720
Say, at rest, a person consumes 0.35...

06:34.720 --> 06:39.600
763 minutes, that's 13
hours. I've been in here...

06:41.560 --> 06:43.230
.. maybe two hours.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.950
So, 11 hours.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.710
But the box isn't empty.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.830
I'm in here.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.430
The average volume of the human body is...

06:51.480 --> 06:53.950
That's 13 litres less oxygen.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.830
35 minutes less.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.190
Can't panic.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.430
Wasting air.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.310
Slow breaths.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.520
Where's your friend?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.940
The pretty one.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.620
Prick.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.110
If you know something...

07:19.160 --> 07:21.910
How can I know? I'm in here.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.910
You know where Luisa Herrera is.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.550
Sure.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.600
She's in the ground.

07:28.880 --> 07:34.070
You know, if Dr Alexander
doesn't come back,

07:34.120 --> 07:36.670
I might just put something
else in this needle.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.990
No, you won't.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.640
She would...

07:40.240 --> 07:42.240
.. but you wouldn't.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.000
This isn't good for us, either.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.360
We want to find her,
too, but we're stretched.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.350
37 students were kidnapped from
a college in Culiacan last week.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.800
You have a lot to deal with.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.430
A lot to turn a blind eye to.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.870
Have they been in touch?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.430
Have there been any demands?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.190
No. Not yet.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.950
Do you think they will?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.670
She's a foreigner, she has money.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.420
Or maybe they've already
got what they want.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.310
We've got nothing. Nothing, Thomas.
Don't even know if she's still...

08:23.360 --> 08:24.430
I'm at Heathrow, Jack.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.390
I'm on my way. I'll be there
in less than 18 hours.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.870
What do the Foreign Office say?

08:27.920 --> 08:30.070
The embassy in Mexico
City has been instructed

08:30.120 --> 08:31.510
to prioritise Nikki's case...

08:31.560 --> 08:35.150
- But? - There's some hostage situation,
oil workers in the Gulf of Mexico.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.350
But they've promised they'll
get people up to you soon.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.470
What does soon mean?

08:38.520 --> 08:39.710
24 hours.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.909
24 hours?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.230
Be positive, Jack.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.470
When they realise they've got the
wrong person, they'll send her home.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.510
♪ Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow

08:49.560 --> 08:54.030
♪ Boot the grime of this
world in the crotch, dear

08:54.080 --> 08:57.830
♪ And don't go home tonight

08:57.880 --> 09:02.270
♪ Come out and find the one that
you love and who loves you... ♪

09:02.320 --> 09:03.750
She was taken here?

09:03.800 --> 09:07.190
Yes. These are all the
known cartel safe houses,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.870
including the one you were sent to.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.710
Gustavo and his men had all the
main roads blocked within minutes,

09:11.760 --> 09:14.630
so we work on that presumption,
that they had an hour and

09:14.680 --> 09:16.550
a half to take her wherever
they were taking her.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.390
We'll work in a 60km zone,
south along the coast,

09:20.440 --> 09:21.470
inland to the east.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.910
- Why not north? - Because they
knew we'd be coming from there.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.270
They sent us to that fake tip-off.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.190
We have to make rational presumptions.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.630
We cannot search everywhere.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.510
That still leaves all these...

09:32.560 --> 09:35.190
We found 4X4 tyre tracks
leading off the road.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.430
There's nobody around.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.070
Not that we can see, anyway.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.950
The only obvious skid marks match
the tread pattern from Eva's car.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.390
And nothing to pin down the
vehicle they took Nikki in?

09:43.440 --> 09:46.790
There were other tyre tracks
about 20 metres behind Eva's car,

09:46.840 --> 09:51.270
but the tread pattern is FS-470,

09:51.320 --> 09:53.270
which suggests a late-model
saloon, not a 4X4.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.710
So, we've got...

09:54.760 --> 09:56.360
Very little.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.430
Sorry.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.470
This isn't your fault, Jack.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.320
I'll check those tread patterns, OK?

10:21.680 --> 10:23.280
Who are you?

10:23.880 --> 10:26.280
What have you done with her?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.790
Jack...

10:31.840 --> 10:33.180
Nikki?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.390
Nikki?!

10:36.440 --> 10:37.870
Jesus!

10:37.920 --> 10:39.870
Nikki, where are you?
I'll come and get you.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.310
- Jack...
- Nikki, thank God you're safe.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.700
How did... How did you...?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.710
Nikki, are you OK?

10:47.760 --> 10:48.830
Can you talk?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.020
No.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.550
Nikki, are you hurt?

10:52.600 --> 10:55.390
No, I...

10:55.440 --> 10:57.780
Just tell me where you are.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.630
Nikki, is there... Is there
someone there with you?

11:00.680 --> 11:01.790
No.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.230
Can you tell me where you are?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.150
What can you see?

11:05.960 --> 11:07.070
Nothing.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.670
Any detail, the room
you're in, anything at all.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.350
I'm not in a room, Jack.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.710
So where are you?

11:12.760 --> 11:14.390
I'm under the ground.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.110
What?

11:16.160 --> 11:17.790
Buried.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.270
What?

11:19.320 --> 11:20.670
In some sort of box.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.270
Under the ground.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.260
Do you understand?

11:24.800 --> 11:26.470
Help me, please.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.110
I'm panicking.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.710
I'm running out of air...

11:29.760 --> 11:31.150
It's OK, Nikki.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.990
It's OK, we're going to find you.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.910
How will you find me?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.310
I'm going to die in here, Jack.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.510
No. No, you're not.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.990
Don't lie to me.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.270
Don't tell me things that
you can't know, can't do.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.790
Listen...

11:44.720 --> 11:47.150
- If I don't make it out of here, Jack...
- No, stop it, Nikki!

11:47.200 --> 11:48.600
Stop it.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.390
Did you text me your number?

11:53.440 --> 11:54.430
No.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.710
The phone they left me,
it doesn't call out.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.270
Then somebody else did, Nikki.
Somebody texted me your number.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.720
They want me to talk to you.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.190
Do you understand?

12:03.240 --> 12:05.550
If they wanted you dead,
why let me talk to you?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.310
He called me on this phone.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.510
Did you recognise his voice?

12:09.560 --> 12:13.830
Sounded like his voice was
altered, it sounded electronic.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.430
Why would they take me?

12:15.480 --> 12:19.390
We'll know that soon. Whatever
it is they ask, we'll do it.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.030
Is there anything else you can tell me?

12:22.080 --> 12:23.270
Oh, my God, Eva...

12:23.320 --> 12:24.750
Is she OK?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.590
Is she buried, too, somewhere?

12:26.640 --> 12:27.830
Oh, my God. Did they kill her?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.990
Nikki, no. We found her,
she has a bump on her head,

12:30.040 --> 12:31.430
she's going to be fine.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.470
You mustn't worry about anybody else, OK?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.320
I was asleep in the car, and then...

12:37.600 --> 12:39.470
I don't remember.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.830
I woke here.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.830
In the dark.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.750
Do you have food?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.630
No. Water.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.510
I don't think it's water
that's the problem, Jack.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.910
This box, this thing
you're in, how big is it?

12:54.960 --> 12:58.190
I've got about nine
hours, Jack, maybe ten.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.550
The box is wood, slats.

13:00.600 --> 13:05.310
- Give me everything.
- I've reckoned 850 by 650 by 2,300.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.790
Do you know how deep you are?

13:06.840 --> 13:09.110
Too deep to push up. I tried.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.590
Some dirt fell through. It was cold.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.030
Was the earth dry?

13:13.080 --> 13:16.950
It's not sand. It's not
clay. It's dry earth.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.670
Like the whole of this damn country!

13:18.720 --> 13:20.630
OK, what's in it? Can you taste it?

13:20.680 --> 13:21.750
What?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.270
Taste it!

13:31.040 --> 13:32.790
It tastes metallic.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.040
More metal than mineral?

13:35.200 --> 13:38.360
It's got a lovely bouquet,
Jack, but I prefer the '74.

13:39.670 --> 13:40.670
Metal.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.110
Maybe iron?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.270
And salt.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.950
Salt... so maybe near the sea.
Some kind of salt flats, maybe.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.990
Nikki?

13:47.040 --> 13:48.580
Oh, my God!

13:50.480 --> 13:51.670
Are you OK?

13:51.720 --> 13:52.830
Nikki?

13:52.880 --> 13:54.550
Nikki, are you OK?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.070
Nikki!

13:56.120 --> 13:58.060
Nikki, are you OK?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.830
I'm OK.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.190
What was that?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.310
I don't know.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.390
It hasn't happened before.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.310
It might be an industrial site.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.150
If it happens again, record the time.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.590
Maybe we can build up a pattern.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.030
If we're relying on that...

14:13.080 --> 14:15.350
No, we're not. We're not.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.190
Everyone is out looking for
you -- the police, the army,

14:20.240 --> 14:21.550
the British Embassy.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.200
There's helicopters everywhere.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.350
Jack...

14:28.400 --> 14:31.500
I've got your number.
I'm going to track it.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.350
The phone's been tampered with.
I don't think it will track.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.870
We'll find you.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.270
I will find you.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.550
I'll call you every half-hour, OK?

14:40.600 --> 14:41.870
No, don't.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.830
The battery. My air...

14:43.880 --> 14:46.980
Only call if you've got
something to tell me.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.080
Nikki...

14:50.560 --> 14:52.560
.. you're not alone.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.800
I'm in a wooden box,
under the earth, Jack.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.240
I'm quite alone.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.950
- Nikki?
- If you tell anyone, she'll die.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.510
If you discuss anything I tell
you, you will never find her.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.190
No police, no army, no authorities.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.630
We have people everywhere, we'll know.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.950
Who are you?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.030
What do you want?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.590
Money?

15:29.640 --> 15:32.270
I can get money. If it's not a crazy
number, I can get it to you quickly.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.310
Just tell me how much.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.790
How much can you get?

15:34.840 --> 15:35.870
Maybe 100,000.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.150
Is that all?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.670
Is that what she's worth to you?

15:38.720 --> 15:41.630
No, no, no, no, no, no. I can
get more, I can get more.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.270
I just need to figure out
how. There isn't much time.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.950
Maybe if you'll get her
out of there, then...

15:47.000 --> 15:48.710
It's not money, pendejo.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.070
Then what is it?! Tell me!

15:51.120 --> 15:54.790
If you want to see her again,
you do exactly what we tell you.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.470
No. Wait, wait.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.030
Shit!

15:59.080 --> 16:00.590
Shit!

16:00.640 --> 16:01.670
'Gustavo, listen...'

16:01.720 --> 16:02.710
Are you all right?

16:02.760 --> 16:03.910
'I spoke to her, to Nikki.'

16:03.960 --> 16:04.990
You spoke to her?

16:05.040 --> 16:07.980
She's underground somewhere, in a box.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.630
What is it? What have you found?

16:19.680 --> 16:22.280
Just wait. It might be nothing.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.200
Tell me. What's there? What's happening?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.350
What is it? What can you see?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.540
It's a wooden box.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.880
Come on. Please, please.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.340
Is she OK?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.950
Forget it.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.230
- It's not her.
- What do you mean?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.310
Is it a body?

16:48.360 --> 16:49.990
It's no-one.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.580
It's guns.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.950
I told you.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.910
You won't find her.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.900
You piece of shit.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.839
We'll go, we'll leave this place.
Whatever... whatever you say.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.910
What do you want?

17:17.960 --> 17:21.950
There's a man being held at the
Regional Police Headquarters.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.790
You have access to that man.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.069
Get him out.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.230
Deliver him to us.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.790
El Buitre.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.110
Or she will die in there.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.220
Oh, my God.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.640
Oh, God. I hate spiders.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.590
Hello?

19:44.640 --> 19:46.030
Nikki, are you OK?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.620
No, wait...

19:48.480 --> 19:49.750
Nikki?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.430
Jack, I've got to get out of here now.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.910
I know, I know, Nikki. I know.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.300
No, I mean right now, Jack!

20:00.120 --> 20:01.990
Any luck with tracking this phone?

20:02.040 --> 20:03.750
You were right about
the phone, it's hacked.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.550
Eva says they've found ones
like it in cartel safe-houses.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.390
Have they contacted you?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.710
We're negotiating.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.230
You're what?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.590
How much do they want?

20:12.640 --> 20:14.950
Don't you worry about
it, we're nearly there.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.750
And if you're not?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.540
If you can't...

20:20.360 --> 20:22.470
You've looked, haven't you, Jack?

20:22.520 --> 20:23.910
Looked at what?

20:23.960 --> 20:28.910
Come on, Jack. I know you.
The last of the Boy Scouts.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.510
You've searched on the
internet, haven't you?

20:31.560 --> 20:34.080
101 death-defying escapes.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.750
All right, but you're
not going to like it.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.960
We don't know how deep you
are, so it's a one-shot thing.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.310
You've got to break through
the top of the box somehow.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.230
You've got to get your
feet up, kick through it,

20:47.280 --> 20:50.310
enough space to let the earth in,
enough to get your head out...

20:50.360 --> 20:51.910
Go on.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.670
Then you wait.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.630
Let the box start to fill with earth.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.950
You've got to wait as long as you can.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.310
Then cover your face with whatever
you've got, anything at all,

21:01.360 --> 21:04.750
so that the earth doesn't
suffocate you as you push up.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.910
And that's it?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.590
Keep going up.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.950
Don't stop.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.740
Because I've got no way back down.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.940
The box will be full of earth.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.520
I see what you mean.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.060
It is a one-shot thing.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.750
It's not going to come
to that, though, Nikki.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.590
Jack...

21:25.640 --> 21:26.990
I don't want to be buried.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.990
You're not. We're getting you out!

21:29.040 --> 21:31.380
No, that's not what I mean.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.910
When I die...

21:35.560 --> 21:37.430
.. whenever it is,

21:37.480 --> 21:39.820
make sure I'm cremated, OK?

21:40.200 --> 21:42.670
In my will, it says
that I want to be buried

21:42.720 --> 21:43.950
beside my mother.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.190
Well, I don't.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.270
I don't want to be under the ground.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.660
Please.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.590
I promise you,

21:51.640 --> 21:53.950
when the time comes,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.510
and you and I, Clarissa and
Thomas are sitting in adjoining

21:57.560 --> 22:01.310
armchairs in the Sunnyview
Nursing Home TV room

22:01.360 --> 22:04.750
and I look down and your
custard cream lies, unnibbled,

22:04.800 --> 22:07.070
in your cold dead hand...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.540
.. I will burn you. I promise.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.790
Listen, Jack, I've been thinking.

22:15.840 --> 22:19.880
Javier Rodriguez, the farm
worker I did the postmortem on...

22:21.360 --> 22:23.790
It's possible that he was kept here.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.110
I mean, like this.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.510
And the chemical that was in his body...

22:27.560 --> 22:28.670
Did we get a fix on it?

22:28.720 --> 22:32.990
No, but Clarissa should
have the sample back by now.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.640
Maybe I'm not the only one here.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.420
Oh, my God.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.190
Luisa...

22:39.240 --> 22:40.910
Nikki, stop.

22:40.960 --> 22:45.750
I need you to think back through
every case you've ever done...

22:45.800 --> 22:47.150
Every case?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.990
I'm sorry, you've got
something better to do?

22:49.040 --> 22:52.990
You've come across this toxin
before -- you know you have.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.390
I'm calling Clarissa now.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.750
I'll call you back when
I've spoken to her. OK?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.230
I'm sorry for being such a coward, Jack.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.070
Ah, yeah. You've got a
yellow streak a mile wide.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.990
Everyone says it.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.070
I'm afraid...

23:08.960 --> 23:11.830
.. of what was going to happen to me.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.150
I killed a scorpion, Jack.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.280
Well, give a donation to
the RSPCA when you get home.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.220
I'm hanging up now.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.470
They've made contact.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.990
Nikki's kidnappers.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.980
What did they say?

23:46.280 --> 23:48.680
I think they're watching me.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.510
They seem to know everything I do.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.390
I think there's someone
within the compound...

23:54.440 --> 23:56.550
So, you think we were set up?

23:56.600 --> 23:58.390
What, Luisa?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.710
- Ernesto, too?
- Maybe.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.590
There are two calls from Luisa's
phone that are still unexplained.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.630
One to Gustavo...

24:05.680 --> 24:08.230
He did explain. He never
got it, he was on a flight.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.910
The flight had landed by then.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.960
I checked. It landed 15 minutes before.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.950
Gustavo and Luisa, they were...

24:15.000 --> 24:16.790
You were the only one who knew about them,

24:16.840 --> 24:19.590
the only one who'd seen them together.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.740
They were together.
They were happy. They...

24:24.920 --> 24:26.920
What? Eva, please...

24:28.040 --> 24:31.470
They had a fight, an argument.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.790
It was just before he left for Hermosillo.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.440
I don't know what it was about.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.420
This is stupid.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.750
You said two calls?

24:41.800 --> 24:44.790
Someone called Luisa from a
public call box in San Lorenzo.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.910
The call we think sent her to the farm.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.660
Now, if they were all taken
by the same kidnappers...

24:51.840 --> 24:54.310
You're right, this is stupid.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.590
What do they want?

24:56.640 --> 25:01.070
Jack, I've lost one son, maybe two.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.870
If there was anything I
could have done, could do,

25:04.920 --> 25:09.150
to get them back, to
have them here, at home,

25:09.200 --> 25:10.740
I'd do it.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.550
Anything.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.950
Give them what they want, Jack.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.030
No-one will blame you.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.220
This is not your fight.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
There was a child...

25:25.240 --> 25:26.780
.. a girl.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.220
Who did the postmortem?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.670
It wasn't me.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.030
Was it Harry?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.300
Oh, no, it was Leo.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.950
We can ask Leo...

25:44.720 --> 25:46.920
What am I talking about?

25:47.760 --> 25:49.300
Leo's dead.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.320
Oh, God.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.260
She's not like the others.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.960
She doesn't belong here.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.780
I'm sorry.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.390
Wait, Jack.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.440
Nikki's coming home.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.060
She has to.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.580
She's coming home.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.680
Oh, shit. Luisa's phone?

27:38.120 --> 27:40.060
Eight missed calls.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.260
I know that number.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.350
Call box.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.200
This is Nikki Alexander.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.150
I'm a doctor,

28:00.200 --> 28:02.830
a pathologist from England,

28:02.880 --> 28:05.990
working for the British Home Office.

28:06.040 --> 28:09.350
I've been doing some work
with the Reunited Project.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.900
It's possible I'm not going
to live through this...

28:13.440 --> 28:16.440
.. but there are some
things I want to say.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.950
Jack...

28:22.000 --> 28:25.100
I know you've been doing
everything you can.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.670
I know you're frantic,

28:26.720 --> 28:29.590
I know you'll feel like you failed...

28:30.120 --> 28:33.820
.. but your voice has kept
me sane in here, you know.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.420
Clarissa...

28:38.160 --> 28:40.700
.. I never thanked you enough.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.840
I never told you how loved you are.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.230
Thomas,

28:48.280 --> 28:51.080
I'm sorry I've caused so much fuss.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.430
I know I drive you crazy,

28:54.480 --> 28:56.820
but I respect you so much.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.800
I know you all wonder sometimes
why I've never settled down.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.390
Why I've never focused on my own life,

29:08.440 --> 29:10.310
a family maybe...

29:11.520 --> 29:13.920
But this has been my family.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.470
Your lives,

29:16.520 --> 29:18.260
their lives...

29:19.240 --> 29:22.540
.. it's the only decent
family I've ever known.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.830
Jack, Clarissa, Thomas,

29:26.880 --> 29:28.820
you are my family.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.420
I love you.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.080
Hey, she's dead.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.310
Luisa muerta.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.910
You understand me?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.950
You sent her to that farm.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.670
I need to know what you told her.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.630
'Where have you been?'

30:20.680 --> 30:22.310
San Lorenzo. I wanted to check something.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.070
I've been thinking about you and

30:24.120 --> 30:27.070
that girl you were seeing
a while back. Amy, right?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.590
Anna? All right...

30:28.640 --> 30:30.430
What's your problem?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.830
She was nice..

30:31.880 --> 30:33.830
What makes you so sure
you can do any better?

30:33.880 --> 30:36.550
What? What are you talking about?

30:36.600 --> 30:39.270
Men... is what I'm talking about.

30:39.960 --> 30:43.030
You think you're
romantics, but you're not.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.020
You're obsessives.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.580
You fix on something
and nothing else exists.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.840
It's brutal.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.580
A man put you in there.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.590
What does he think he'll achieve?

30:58.640 --> 31:00.390
I'm not alone.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.030
There's 30,000 of us under this earth.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.910
That's a whole city

31:04.960 --> 31:06.560
A city lost.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.550
We're breathing dirt.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.420
You've got time, Nikki.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.550
Six hours.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.150
And then what?

31:19.200 --> 31:22.070
It starts in the liver and then the brain.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.630
The cells start to break down.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.430
- Autolysis.
- Nikki...

31:26.480 --> 31:29.990
The first to arrive will be
the Phoridae, coffin flies.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.590
They can burrow through two feet of earth.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.790
And the Nicrophorus, the carrion beetles.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.950
And then the ones that feed on
the others will join the feast,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.590
the spiders and millipedes and mites,

31:41.640 --> 31:44.190
the insect fauna specific to the region...

31:44.240 --> 31:45.750
Nikki!

31:45.800 --> 31:48.350
Oxygen escapes through the slats.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.710
I haven't got six hours, have I?

31:50.760 --> 31:53.360
Jack, how much time have I got?

31:56.600 --> 31:58.400
You've got time.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.390
You called me.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.690
You said San Lorenzo...

32:02.740 --> 32:04.340
What's that?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.600
It's them, isn't it?

32:08.160 --> 32:11.100
Nikki, I'm going to call you back, OK?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.070
- I'm here.
- You're late.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.950
He was meant to get his
insulin shot an hour ago.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.950
Why haven't you done what we told you?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.670
You must know time is running out for her.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.750
It takes planning.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.750
I can't just break in there
and bust the guy out...

32:25.800 --> 32:27.950
Get him out.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.600
We'll tell you what to do then.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.680
Shit! Shit!

33:29.920 --> 33:31.790
What are you going to do with that?

33:31.840 --> 33:35.670
I want to be able to protect
myself. Look what happened to Nikki.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.550
I don't know.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.340
I don't know what I'm going to do.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.030
What do you want from me?

33:45.080 --> 33:46.270
What do they want from you?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.030
The cartel?

33:48.080 --> 33:50.420
They haven't said anything.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.640
You know, don't you?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.310
It's you.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.910
Me? What's me?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.630
I've been to San Lorenzo.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.910
You didn't check out that
call box, did you? I did.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.350
I know why Luisa went
to the farm that day.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.830
She was told the farmers had
been threatened and robbed.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.909
- By the Navajas...
- Ah, come on!

34:10.960 --> 34:14.460
The men who demanded the
money wore yellow shirts.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.190
Yes.

34:17.239 --> 34:20.710
That's what you and Luisa
fought about, wasn't it?

34:20.760 --> 34:24.860
She knew what you were doing,
she knew about the corruption.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.020
Who said that?

34:31.560 --> 34:32.750
That's why she went to the farm?

34:32.800 --> 34:34.030
Are you sure?

34:34.080 --> 34:35.550
Go on. Deny it.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.469
OK, we did fight.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.909
The night before I left.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.230
She kept saying that I couldn't
see what was in front of me,

34:42.280 --> 34:44.150
that I was blind.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.310
Some of my own men, she said.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.150
Working with the cartel?

34:48.199 --> 34:50.469
I told her she was crazy.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.790
She went to get proof at the farm.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.310
That's why the cartel took her.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.350
So that she couldn't tell
me what she'd found out.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.670
She's gone because of me.

35:01.240 --> 35:05.360
You know, the cartel
want me to get him out.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.470
The prisoner, El Buitre.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.660
And if I don't do it...

35:12.840 --> 35:16.510
Look, she's only got a
few hours of air left.

35:16.560 --> 35:19.470
What does it matter, one
more or one less of them?

35:19.520 --> 35:21.350
Nikki matters.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.150
Right, she saves lives.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.550
No, this is not the way.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.070
I'm not asking you, man.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.270
It's my choice, my decision,

35:28.320 --> 35:29.790
my fault.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.560
You're not going to get him
out of there with that gun.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.710
Look, the police are
terrified of El Buitre,

35:39.760 --> 35:41.470
of what he'll bring down on them,

35:41.520 --> 35:43.830
but they can't just let him go.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.430
But, if he were to die in there, now
that would be their worst nightmare.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.790
I don't understand.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.640
I'm saying... there's a better way.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.230
Nikki, you're not going to
hear from me for an hour or so.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.510
You're not to worry, OK?

36:06.560 --> 36:07.830
I'm going to get you out of there.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.150
What are you going to do?

36:10.200 --> 36:11.470
Jack?

36:25.400 --> 36:28.270
I don't like it any more than you do.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.020
Espera!

37:01.520 --> 37:03.470
Right, it's a fit. He's hypoglycaemic.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.870
He's had a bad reaction to the insulin.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.190
What else has he taken today?

37:07.240 --> 37:08.630
Give me that blanket. Quickly.

37:08.680 --> 37:09.670
Give him sugar.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.950
Don't be daft, he's having a
seizure. It could choke him.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.750
We need emergency care. Do you
want him to die in your jail cell?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.030
Call an ambulance.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.110
We're losing him here,
we're losing him. Shit!

37:18.160 --> 37:22.460
He's gone into insulin shock.
It's a coma. Get me a stretcher.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.660
Elevator, elevator!

37:51.560 --> 37:53.900
Go, go! Let's go, let's go!

38:03.120 --> 38:04.430
No, no, no, no, no. Out, out, out.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.220
He's dangerous.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.510
What's he saying?

38:24.560 --> 38:25.950
He's saying, hit him.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.540
Just do it.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.220
He's no use to us dead.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.080
- Jack?
- Wait.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.640
Come on, come on, come
on come on, come on.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.740
Come on. Don't you die.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.350
Here he comes, here he comes.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.190
OK. Take us here.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.990
About a half an hour away.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.110
He said they'd know when we got him out.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.030
They've got people in
the police, don't they?

39:22.080 --> 39:23.270
The cartel are everywhere.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.860
We're all running out of time.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.700
Here they come.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.080
Where's Nikki? I don't see her.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.230
We saved your life so you can
go on killing for the cartel.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.990
I kill for anyone.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.070
The cartel, the police.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.920
Whoever pays me.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.270
And no-one does it as good as me.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.470
Hey, wait. Wait, where
is she? Where's Nikki?!

40:14.520 --> 40:17.270
Wait, where are you going? What, are
they're bringing her back? Where?

40:17.320 --> 40:21.710
- I don't know. - Where is she?
Are they going to bring her out?

40:21.760 --> 40:23.590
Jesus. Shit.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.630
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.710
Jack. Jack!

40:26.760 --> 40:30.430
No, no, no. Where is she? Nikki? I
gave you him, where's my friend?

40:30.480 --> 40:31.750
Wait!

40:32.880 --> 40:34.270
Jesus Christ!

40:34.320 --> 40:36.110
What just happened?

40:36.160 --> 40:37.790
There was no exchange, was there?

40:37.840 --> 40:40.940
He didn't even know
what I was talking about!

40:41.360 --> 40:43.030
Why kill him?

40:45.120 --> 40:48.220
He's dead, and all their
crimes die with him.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.670
They've got what they want.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.910
It won't be long now, Nikki.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.390
What have you done?

40:56.440 --> 40:59.240
We're going to get you out of there.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.230
We're going home.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.740
Is she?

41:10.400 --> 41:12.340
Is she coming home?

41:13.360 --> 41:15.510
She's got an hour or
two of air left, maybe.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.390
Possibly less, as the
carbon dioxide builds up.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.430
Let's go.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.950
The police will be here soon.

41:29.160 --> 41:31.030
What have I done?

41:41.080 --> 41:42.590
It's amazing.

41:42.640 --> 41:45.030
Jack, Gustavo, it's amazing.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.110
They were left on the side
of the road 30 minutes ago.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.710
My baby.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.100
Nikki?

41:51.960 --> 41:53.190
It won't be long, Jack.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.310
I'm sure of it. Luisa, too.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.300
This is incredible.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.510
Please!

42:40.560 --> 42:42.360
Just get me out!

42:56.640 --> 42:58.710
They get El Buitre...

42:59.760 --> 43:02.100
.. and Ernesto walks free.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.240
Ernesto walks free.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.990
'I've lost one son,

43:21.040 --> 43:22.510
'maybe two.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.070
'If there was anything I could do'

43:25.120 --> 43:27.150
to get them back, I'd do it.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.350
Anything.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.600
Eva.

43:33.160 --> 43:36.230
Eva! Eva!

43:36.280 --> 43:38.350
'Jack, this doesn't make sense.'

43:38.400 --> 43:40.710
She made a deal with them, Gustavo.

43:40.760 --> 43:44.350
She gives them El Buitre,
they give her her son back.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.390
Father Cadena, the priest of Chilapa,

43:46.440 --> 43:48.190
he knows people in the cartel.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.750
He's acted as an intermediary
for us in the past.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.910
- Nesto?
- Mama.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.310
I had access to the prisoner,

43:55.360 --> 43:58.030
she had to find a way to get
me to do it. Don't you see?

43:58.080 --> 44:03.150
You wanted something, and you found
something to give them in return.

44:03.200 --> 44:06.190
They get El Buitre, and
Ernesto walks free.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.470
Eva?

44:07.520 --> 44:08.990
Eva, are you there?

44:09.040 --> 44:10.910
Eva, stop, please.

44:10.960 --> 44:13.110
I know what you did and I know why.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.430
Please, stop. Eva?

44:15.480 --> 44:16.550
'Nikki is OK.'

44:16.600 --> 44:18.470
Tell me where she is, please!

44:18.520 --> 44:19.990
'I'm going to make this right.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.590
'It's all going to be all right.'

44:21.640 --> 44:24.030
Where is she, Eva? Where did you bury her.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.510
She doesn't have much time.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.230
I only did what I had to do.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.950
- Eva! - You think you
know what it's like...

44:29.000 --> 44:30.940
Stop! Please, stop!

44:33.920 --> 44:35.550
Eva! Eva!

44:35.600 --> 44:37.740
Eva, what's happening?

44:47.440 --> 44:48.640
Eva!

44:50.080 --> 44:52.150
Eva... Eva.

44:52.200 --> 44:53.350
Oh, God.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.600
Eva?

44:55.680 --> 44:57.190
Eva, where is she?

44:57.240 --> 44:59.550
Oh, my God. Eva?

44:59.600 --> 45:02.430
Eva, wake up and tell me where she is!

45:02.480 --> 45:03.950
Oh, Jesus.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.070
Oh, Jesus.

45:05.120 --> 45:07.150
'I'd give my life for him.'

45:07.200 --> 45:09.800
I'd give all our lives for him.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.550
Nikki?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.630
Are they coming, Jack?

45:16.680 --> 45:19.620
I'm running out of air, I can feel it.

45:21.040 --> 45:24.040
I don't know how much more I can take...

45:24.160 --> 45:25.870
Nikki, listen.

45:25.920 --> 45:30.030
When you were with Eva, when
you fell asleep in the car,

45:30.080 --> 45:32.390
do you remember exactly where you were?

45:32.440 --> 45:34.780
Why are you asking me this?

45:35.600 --> 45:37.750
Aren't they... aren't they coming?

45:37.800 --> 45:41.470
Please, did you see anything
by the road, any landmarks,

45:41.520 --> 45:43.110
before you passed out?

45:43.160 --> 45:45.070
What do you mean, "passed out"?

45:45.120 --> 45:47.270
I'm scared, Jack.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.270
What's happening?

45:49.320 --> 45:50.870
Please tell me the truth.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.790
I need the truth.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.080
It wasn't the cartel that took you.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.910
It was Eva.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.190
To get Ernesto back.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.470
No.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.790
It was a man who called.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.150
Yeah, I've got her phone.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.430
There's an application on
it that changes your voice,

46:08.480 --> 46:10.390
it costs, like, a dollar.

46:10.440 --> 46:13.240
Eva's dead, Nikki. They killed her.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.750
But we're coming to find you.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.040
Now we know it was her that
took you, we will find you.

46:22.920 --> 46:24.260
Nikki?

46:25.880 --> 46:27.220
Nikki?

46:30.120 --> 46:31.710
Nikki, are you there?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.390
What's happening, Nikki?

46:33.440 --> 46:36.190
I'm going to get out of here, Jack.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.110
Like you told me.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.120
No, Nikki! Wait, please.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.400
Please, not yet. Not yet. Wait.

46:56.720 --> 46:59.720
Nikki, are you there? What's happening?

47:14.280 --> 47:16.350
Nikki, are you there?

47:22.200 --> 47:23.940
I can't do it.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.540
I'm not strong enough.

47:32.120 --> 47:34.390
Don't you give up, Nikki.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.660
Don't give up.

47:37.960 --> 47:41.070
What you do isn't about death, is it?

47:41.120 --> 47:44.270
It's about the value we place on a life.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.750
That's what I've learnt from you...

47:45.800 --> 47:46.990
Look at the pupae.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.150
.. Clarissa, Jack and Thomas.

47:49.200 --> 47:53.360
You only get this in cases
of extreme contamination.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.950
Industrial levels.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.870
I found something that
seemed to correspond.

47:58.920 --> 48:02.070
A chemical compound
developed for industrial R&D.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.550
It sometimes goes under
different trade names.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.870
- Nikki? - It still has some
limited industrial application,

48:06.920 --> 48:09.710
but it's so carcinogenic, it's
restricted to laboratory usage.

48:09.760 --> 48:11.270
Tetracynadine.

48:11.320 --> 48:12.310
What?

48:12.360 --> 48:14.030
Tetracynadine.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.830
Berricane. It's marketed
under different names.

48:16.880 --> 48:17.870
What is?

48:17.920 --> 48:21.310
The chemical we found in
Javier Rodriguez' liver.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.830
It's an industrial chemical.

48:22.880 --> 48:26.470
Find where they're using
Tetracynadine, Jack,

48:26.520 --> 48:27.990
you'll find me.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.750
There's one right here, here and here.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.510
These are small-scale facilities.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.230
We're looking for something much bigger.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.630
This is a heavy-duty chemical,

48:34.680 --> 48:36.830
- it would have to be licensed,
controlled... - Like what?

48:36.880 --> 48:38.950
It's used in ore extraction, mining.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.150
There's a copper mine, right here.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.430
It's too far. She wouldn't have
had time to get Nikki there

48:43.480 --> 48:45.110
- and get back...
- How can you be sure of that?

48:45.160 --> 48:48.030
I can't! I can't be sure about anything.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.750
What about manufacturing, plastics?

48:50.800 --> 48:53.270
It was used in transmission fluid
for the automobile industry,

48:53.320 --> 48:55.230
- but they stopped...
- What about old cars? Trucks?

48:55.280 --> 48:57.790
There's a scrapyard right
here, near Novelda. It's huge.

48:57.840 --> 48:58.990
It's inside the search area.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.110
I know the scrapyard.

49:01.240 --> 49:02.350
Nesto...

49:02.400 --> 49:03.790
We went there.

49:03.840 --> 49:04.990
To Novelda.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.030
- What?
- It was years ago, I remember.

49:07.080 --> 49:10.510
Her windshield was cracked,
so we went to find a new one.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.430
She knew the guy.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.310
We know where you are, Nikki.
We're coming to get you.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.710
Where? Where is it?

49:16.760 --> 49:17.950
There's a scrapyard.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.910
The Tetracynadine, it's leaking
out of old transmission units.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.190
Are you sure, Jack?

49:22.240 --> 49:24.270
The level of contamination
we're talking about,

49:24.320 --> 49:26.110
there's only one possible site.

49:26.160 --> 49:29.390
The rumbling sound you're
hearing, there's a car crusher.

49:29.440 --> 49:31.110
It's the place, I'm sure of it.

49:31.160 --> 49:34.110
You're going to be home
in London for the weekend.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.670
Forecast is for eight degrees and drizzle.

49:36.720 --> 49:38.860
Sounds beautiful, Jack.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.590
We're here. Tell me if you can hear this.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.270
Nikki!

49:56.320 --> 49:57.660
Nikki!

50:00.120 --> 50:01.990
OK, stay with me.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.670
You stay with me.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.510
Stay with me. We're coming for you.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.560
We're coming. Nikki!

50:12.400 --> 50:13.740
Nikki!

50:53.760 --> 50:55.500
I can't find...

51:07.880 --> 51:09.440
OK. OK.

51:17.480 --> 51:18.880
Gustavo.

51:19.720 --> 51:20.990
Gustavo!

51:21.040 --> 51:22.190
Over here!

51:22.240 --> 51:24.840
Get someone to move this truck.

51:25.830 --> 51:26.830
Come on.

51:26.880 --> 51:28.870
Push it.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.190
Push!

51:33.920 --> 51:35.230
Can you hear us, Nikki?

51:35.280 --> 51:37.750
You're close. I know it.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.870
We're coming for you.

51:41.680 --> 51:43.070
Come on.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.990
We're coming, Nikki. Cover your eyes!

51:51.520 --> 51:52.830
Nikki!

51:52.880 --> 51:54.030
Nikki!

51:54.080 --> 51:55.430
Nikki?

51:55.480 --> 51:56.820
Nikki?

52:09.240 --> 52:10.980
Where are you?

52:11.880 --> 52:14.110
Have you found them, Jack?

52:14.160 --> 52:15.470
Have you found them?

52:15.520 --> 52:17.070
You're not here?

52:17.120 --> 52:18.630
Are they alive, Jack?

52:18.680 --> 52:21.350
Yes, they're alive, but, Nikki...

52:22.520 --> 52:24.460
I don't understand.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.670
Oh, Nikki.....

52:27.720 --> 52:29.470
Luisa...

52:29.520 --> 52:31.190
is she there?

52:32.840 --> 52:34.780
What have you done?

52:38.120 --> 52:39.830
What have you done?!

52:39.880 --> 52:43.080
The Tetracynadine that
was in Javier's body...

52:44.320 --> 52:46.750
.. kills insects,

52:46.800 --> 52:49.000
any invertebrate life...

52:49.080 --> 52:51.030
There was a scorpion,

52:51.080 --> 52:53.350
so it's not where I am...

52:54.200 --> 52:55.910
.. but I'm glad...

52:55.960 --> 52:57.500
No, no, no.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.750
No, Nikki, no. You could have...

53:00.800 --> 53:03.070
How many are there, Jack?

53:03.360 --> 53:05.150
Oh, my God.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.990
20, 30.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.230
And they're alive?

53:08.280 --> 53:10.110
Yes, they're alive.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.630
Luisa?

53:11.680 --> 53:14.780
Yes, she's alive. She's with Gustavo now.

53:30.480 --> 53:31.990
No, wait.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.470
Wait, wait, wait.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.830
Wait, the air.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.880
- The air shouldn't have...
- It's OK.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.390
It's OK, Jack.

53:40.440 --> 53:41.780
Really.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.200
It's all going to be OK.

53:45.880 --> 53:48.220
Nikki, I didn't tell you...

54:06.160 --> 54:08.100
It's a nice place.

54:09.950 --> 54:10.950
'No tornadoes.'

54:11.000 --> 54:11.990
No tornadoes.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.190
'No volcanoes.'

54:13.240 --> 54:14.910
No volcanoes.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.060
I'm coming, Mum...

55:04.320 --> 55:06.190
Wait, wait, wait.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.980
Wait, the air.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.870
Nikki, I didn't tell you
this, but you should...

55:19.920 --> 55:22.060
(I shouldn't be alive.)

55:30.720 --> 55:32.660
There must be air.

55:43.440 --> 55:45.670
Well, I have to be at
the dig in the morning.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.990
We're excavating Cahitas.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.630
Burial mounds on the coast.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.480
3,000 years old.

55:54.920 --> 55:56.920
I'm not underground.
