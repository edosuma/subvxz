43:27.038 --> 43:30.241
Baby, let me make you
something to eat,
get you some fresh--

43:30.275 --> 43:32.310
Oh, you know what, Ma?

43:32.343 --> 43:35.613
When Dad gives me back
my money, how about
I take you out to dinner?

43:35.647 --> 43:37.683
We can rent a scary,
jumpie-outie movie,

43:37.716 --> 43:40.819
curl up on the couch,
and just be one with nature.

43:40.852 --> 43:43.021
[ Laughs ]

43:44.389 --> 43:47.125
How'd you get back so soon?
Hitchhiking.

43:47.158 --> 43:49.327
Isn't that
a little dangerous?
Not if you're armed.

43:49.360 --> 43:53.031
- I stole Dad's gun
out of his rucksack.
- Does he know you took it?

43:53.064 --> 43:56.167
I assume so.

43:56.201 --> 43:59.404
So, what did you learn
in the woods?

44:00.638 --> 44:02.473
I'm gonna like the army.
