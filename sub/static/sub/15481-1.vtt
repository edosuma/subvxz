02:00.719 --> 02:01.935
Hey.

04:29.409 --> 04:30.761
Excuse me?

04:30.764 --> 04:33.231
Sorry, uh, I'm
looking for Marcel.

04:33.233 --> 04:34.553
You're late.

04:36.185 --> 04:38.411
- Very late.
- Sorry.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.502
That's all right, come.

04:41.504 --> 04:42.894
And leave that
hideous thing here.

04:42.896 --> 04:46.024
I don't want to see it.
Come on. Come.

04:52.661 --> 04:54.188
Oh these are nice, this is nice.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.033
This is... I like that.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.898
These are good,
these are very good.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.184
What we're gonna do is,

05:02.186 --> 05:04.339
we're gonna take
some of these out,

05:04.341 --> 05:06.424
and put these back in instead.

05:06.426 --> 05:08.127
- Okay.
- Yeah? All right.

05:08.129 --> 05:10.488
So now just go get changed

05:10.490 --> 05:10.908
and we'll take
some measurements

05:10.910 --> 05:12.436
and a few pictures
and we'll be done.

05:12.439 --> 05:13.725
- Okay. Sure.
- Yeah?

05:22.344 --> 05:23.767
So you ready for tomorrow?

05:23.769 --> 05:25.297
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

05:25.299 --> 05:27.520
He's a very important
photographer, so...

05:27.522 --> 05:30.650
if he likes you, this
could mean the world.

05:30.652 --> 05:32.388
- So you'd better be good, huh?
- Yeah.

05:32.390 --> 05:33.572
Yeah?

05:42.711 --> 05:44.103
Hello?

05:51.922 --> 05:53.486
Hello?

05:55.710 --> 05:56.719
Hi.

06:04.086 --> 06:07.284
- You are late.
- Yeah, I know.

06:12.707 --> 06:15.280
I need to leave, so
I'll just show you fast.

06:19.936 --> 06:21.500
This is it.

06:23.655 --> 06:26.989
There's another girl
living here, Zofia.

06:26.991 --> 06:29.702
She's in Milan, I think,
I don't know when she's back.

06:29.704 --> 06:33.038
She's very nice, you won't
have any problems with her.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.235
- Okay.
- This is your bed.

06:36.238 --> 06:38.459
- I have keys for you.
- Thank you.

06:38.461 --> 06:41.207
You pay rent on the first
and the 15, all right?

06:43.674 --> 06:45.758
Sorry?

06:45.760 --> 06:48.540
It means "welcome."

06:48.542 --> 06:50.557
Oh.

07:54.545 --> 07:57.222
- Morning.
- Good, good. Great.

08:00.106 --> 08:03.267
If you could join him on
the sofa, please, darling.

08:06.258 --> 08:08.341
Mm-hmm, yeah.

08:08.343 --> 08:12.511
Okay, guys, today we're going
to be doing five outfits.

08:12.514 --> 08:15.397
Very sexy, very edgy.

08:15.399 --> 08:18.421
I really want us to push the
fuckin' envelope on this one.

08:18.423 --> 08:21.131
We're gonna try some
stuff on the sofa.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.523
We'll have a
mess-around on the bed,

08:22.525 --> 08:24.191
we can go outside, we
can see how we feel,

08:24.193 --> 08:27.560
I mean, let's have some
fun, this is all about you.

08:27.563 --> 08:29.126
I want you to be free,

08:29.128 --> 08:31.627
and I wanna see your
soul in this one, okay?

08:31.629 --> 08:33.121
All right.

08:33.124 --> 08:35.070
Here you go.

08:35.072 --> 08:37.572
All right, if you can
move a bit closer, please.

08:37.573 --> 08:40.214
Okay, uh, boy,
let's move you over.

08:40.216 --> 08:41.500
You stay where you are, darling.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.410
Okay, that's good, sit back.

08:43.414 --> 08:45.186
Okay, just relax for the moment.

08:49.913 --> 08:51.648
Okay.

08:51.650 --> 08:54.742
Okay, if you can turn sideways,
one leg up on the sofa, please.

08:54.744 --> 08:56.409
- Like... Like this?
- Yes, please.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.182
If you could lift
your knee... knee up higher.

08:58.184 --> 09:00.858
Yeah, let's bring
this leg down, please.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.700
Let's bring this
leg on the floor.

09:02.702 --> 09:04.788
No, the other leg. Thank you.

09:04.790 --> 09:07.253
Okay, one hand on your knee.

09:17.335 --> 09:20.118
Let's try you kissing
on the back of his neck.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.909
Can you just kiss the back
of his neck for real, please?

09:31.413 --> 09:33.568
You need to relax, darling.

09:38.052 --> 09:39.407
Okay.

09:40.867 --> 09:42.709
Um...

09:45.350 --> 09:47.193
Emma, I need a word.

09:58.871 --> 10:00.261
What's wrong?

10:01.893 --> 10:03.597
I don't know.

10:05.369 --> 10:08.743
You've got five minutes to
get your shit together, okay?

10:39.397 --> 10:41.411
Right, that's enough.

10:41.414 --> 10:44.264
That's it.
We're finished.

10:48.051 --> 10:50.829
Emma, you're done for
the day, let's go.

10:50.831 --> 10:54.270
You're finished for the
day, you can leave now.

10:54.272 --> 10:56.358
Did you not hear me? Let's go.

11:01.849 --> 11:04.144
- Go and put some clothes on.
- I'm on it.

11:05.361 --> 11:07.933
There you go.

11:52.039 --> 11:54.193
You won't touch my stuff.

11:54.195 --> 11:56.589
But your stuff
was all over my bed.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.295
No, it wasn't.

12:07.088 --> 12:10.392
I just don't like people
going through my things.

12:22.207 --> 12:23.249
Hey.

12:23.251 --> 12:26.828
- I'm Zofia.
- Emma.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.774
Are you gonna stay long?

12:28.776 --> 12:33.328
Um, for a couple of months,
to start with, and...

12:33.330 --> 12:36.838
then, you know, just
see what happens.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.680
What agency?

12:38.682 --> 12:41.044
- Uh, BTA.
- Cool.

12:41.046 --> 12:43.060
Did they tell you
to lose weight?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.284
No, actually they
said that I was perfect,

12:45.286 --> 12:48.100
that I sh-shouldn't...

12:48.102 --> 12:49.458
change anything.

12:50.986 --> 12:52.723
Hey.

12:52.725 --> 12:54.253
Yeah.

12:54.255 --> 12:57.068
I just got back.

13:28.038 --> 13:29.150
Um...

14:27.542 --> 14:29.417
I don't know, maybe...

14:29.419 --> 14:31.085
maybe it was too early
for you to come here.

14:31.088 --> 14:33.344
Maybe this, maybe
this is not for you.

14:33.346 --> 14:36.368
Did you ever think of that?

14:36.370 --> 14:37.830
- No.
- No?

14:42.140 --> 14:43.805
All I'm saying is,

14:43.807 --> 14:47.455
if you wanna go back
home, it's fine.

14:47.457 --> 14:50.829
Maybe in a year or two, you
can come back and try again.

14:55.207 --> 14:56.631
Are you sending me home?

14:56.633 --> 14:58.751
I'm not sending
you home, honey, but...

14:58.753 --> 15:02.890
You fucked up.
You really fucked up.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.495
No, he was terrible.

15:40.497 --> 15:42.163
What?

15:42.165 --> 15:43.591
You did?

15:45.190 --> 15:48.489
"Just" a blow job?

15:48.491 --> 15:50.680
Ah. Oh.

15:52.939 --> 15:55.370
Okay, talk to you later.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.729
Bye.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.444
We're gonna go out to party
a bit. You wanna come?

16:06.425 --> 16:09.447
Thanks, but I don't
think today's so good.

16:09.449 --> 16:10.596
Why not?

16:14.488 --> 16:18.657
You know, the best way to
get things going in this city

16:18.659 --> 16:21.754
is to go out and meet people.

16:24.220 --> 16:27.071
Staying indoors won't
get you anywhere.

16:34.614 --> 16:36.421
What are you looking at?

16:37.568 --> 16:38.784
Nothing.

17:08.430 --> 17:10.588
This is Emma,
my roommate.

17:14.028 --> 17:15.730
Cheers, everyone.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.069
- You're a friend of Zofia's?
- Yeah.

17:24.071 --> 17:26.606
Yeah, we live together.

17:26.608 --> 17:29.526
I just came to Paris.

17:29.528 --> 17:32.483
- How do you like it so far?
- It's good.

17:34.325 --> 17:35.645
I'm in real estate,

17:35.647 --> 17:38.459
I own quite a few
homes here in Paris.

17:38.461 --> 17:39.988
What?

17:39.990 --> 17:41.277
Okay.

17:42.735 --> 17:44.336
Cheers.

18:07.656 --> 18:10.229
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:14.123 --> 18:16.520
It's... Emma, right?

18:18.153 --> 18:19.439
How are you?

18:19.441 --> 18:21.314
Um...

18:21.316 --> 18:22.986
I'm good.

18:25.940 --> 18:28.023
You should use the men's.
There's no one in there.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.668
Oh, no, that's... it's okay.

18:45.821 --> 18:47.729
Are you okay?

18:47.731 --> 18:48.983
Yeah.

18:54.649 --> 18:57.045
Do you know him?

18:57.047 --> 18:58.783
Shane White?

18:58.785 --> 19:00.349
Just a little.

19:02.885 --> 19:05.180
I love his work.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.548
Mm...

21:26.050 --> 21:27.230
Yeah?

21:30.290 --> 21:31.991
What?

21:35.086 --> 21:36.617
Okay, one second.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.754
- What's up?
- What the fuck are you doing?

21:45.756 --> 21:47.180
What?

21:47.182 --> 21:48.641
Nothing.

21:48.643 --> 21:50.099
- Yesterday, I just...
- No.

21:50.101 --> 21:53.783
Your phone, why
is it turned off?

21:53.785 --> 21:56.044
The agency has been
trying to reach you.

21:56.046 --> 21:57.889
They even called me.

22:02.406 --> 22:03.589
Sit.

22:13.909 --> 22:16.377
I don't know what you did.

22:16.379 --> 22:18.043
Do you remember the photographer

22:18.045 --> 22:20.131
you worked with
on the first day?

22:21.903 --> 22:23.293
Yeah.

22:23.295 --> 22:24.753
Well, he wants to book you

22:24.755 --> 22:27.465
for this editorial
job for <i>L'Officiel.</i>

22:27.467 --> 22:29.514
- What?
- The magazine <i>L'Officiel.</i>

22:29.516 --> 22:30.800
You've heard of <i>L'Officiel,</i> no?

22:30.802 --> 22:33.789
- Of course.
- It's huge!

22:33.791 --> 22:36.778
So, I don't know what you did,

22:36.780 --> 22:38.554
but you did it right.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.278
Hey.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.428
Well done.

22:45.782 --> 22:49.536
I will need your
name and signature.

23:25.474 --> 23:27.767
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:27.769 --> 23:29.122
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

23:29.124 --> 23:32.424
No, me neither.

23:32.426 --> 23:33.814
Wow, it's really nice, huh?

23:33.816 --> 23:35.902
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

23:37.361 --> 23:38.472
This is Emma.

23:38.474 --> 23:40.001
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.669
Hi. Nice to meet you.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.269
We can get her ready
just afterwards?

23:43.271 --> 23:45.250
- Okay? Thanks.
- Yes.

23:45.252 --> 23:46.674
Do you want something
to drink? Coffee?

23:46.676 --> 23:48.798
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Okay.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.626
Okay, guys?

23:53.628 --> 23:56.338
Listen up, ladies.
Attention, please.

23:56.340 --> 23:59.985
So, today we're gonna be
shooting a very classy piece.

23:59.988 --> 24:02.940
Very vintage, very old-school.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.574
Classic, yeah?

24:04.576 --> 24:07.389
I need you to be real bitches
on this one.

24:07.391 --> 24:09.370
Yeah?

24:09.372 --> 24:12.221
Real, nasty Parisian bitches.

24:12.223 --> 24:15.140
Completely out of reach
from these male models.

24:15.142 --> 24:16.773
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

24:16.775 --> 24:17.991
All right, do we understand?

24:17.993 --> 24:19.903
- Yeah, yes.
- All right.

24:19.905 --> 24:23.308
- And Emma, okay?
- What?

24:23.310 --> 24:25.358
You with me?

24:25.360 --> 24:27.689
Fuck you.

24:32.278 --> 24:34.673
This is it.

24:34.675 --> 24:37.245
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

24:37.247 --> 24:38.915
This is the attitude.

24:38.917 --> 24:42.705
Good, okay. All right, I'll
see you out there, girls.

25:12.874 --> 25:15.756
Okay, we're ready.
Give me that intensity.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.632
Oh yes.

25:17.634 --> 25:20.102
You're looking beautiful.
Really great.

25:20.104 --> 25:22.326
Emma, give me
everything you've got.

25:22.328 --> 25:25.835
Okay, beautiful, beautiful.

25:25.838 --> 25:26.947
One more!

25:26.949 --> 25:28.547
Ah, yeah.

25:28.549 --> 25:30.423
Okay, bitch it up.

25:30.425 --> 25:33.275
Just like that, yeah.

25:35.674 --> 25:38.316
Okay, beautiful, beautiful.

25:43.946 --> 25:45.925
What?

25:45.927 --> 25:48.429
Nothing.

25:48.431 --> 25:50.828
It's just not normal to see
models eatin' like that.

25:53.192 --> 25:55.519
Well, I can eat anything.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.952
People must really hate you.

25:57.954 --> 25:59.449
Some.

26:00.942 --> 26:02.574
Tell me about yourself.

26:02.576 --> 26:04.207
What do you want to know?

26:04.209 --> 26:05.633
Everything.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.719
Where are you from?

26:07.721 --> 26:09.491
Are you a country or city girl,

26:09.493 --> 26:12.376
what music do you like,
what's your favorite color?

26:12.378 --> 26:13.800
What's your dream,

26:13.802 --> 26:15.433
what would you take
to a deserted island?

26:15.435 --> 26:17.800
What's your middle name?

26:22.978 --> 26:25.272
Do you have a
boyfriend back home?

26:26.872 --> 26:28.606
Don't do that.

26:28.608 --> 26:29.997
What?

26:29.999 --> 26:32.502
You hide your
mouth when you smile.

26:34.274 --> 26:36.670
You're beautiful.

26:36.672 --> 26:38.827
You shouldn't do that.

26:40.496 --> 26:43.588
You really need to learn how
to take a compliment, too.

26:43.590 --> 26:47.793
See, if I tell you
you're beautiful...

26:47.795 --> 26:49.810
what should you do?

26:55.407 --> 26:59.505
You just straighten
yourself up...

26:59.507 --> 27:01.142
and say, "thank you."

27:03.610 --> 27:04.893
Well, thank you.

27:08.232 --> 27:10.177
So, country or city girl?

27:10.179 --> 27:12.471
Small city.

27:12.473 --> 27:15.217
And, my favorite color...

27:15.219 --> 27:17.301
is red.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.353
- Really?
- Yes.

27:19.355 --> 27:22.063
Okay.
What's your biggest dream?

27:22.065 --> 27:24.219
Oh, that's easy.

27:24.221 --> 27:27.485
Walking in as leader
in Paris Fashion Week.

27:27.488 --> 27:28.806
For who?

27:28.808 --> 27:31.309
Chanel.

27:31.311 --> 27:33.223
Could happen.

27:35.585 --> 27:37.463
So, what's your dream?

27:39.408 --> 27:41.285
Nah, don't know about dreams.

27:48.654 --> 27:51.261
You have the craziest
eyes, you know that?

27:55.120 --> 27:56.926
I want to see you again.

28:17.190 --> 28:20.177
- <i>Hi?</i>
- Hi.

30:31.803 --> 30:34.547
Hey, sorry I'm late.

30:34.549 --> 30:35.869
It's okay.

30:35.871 --> 30:37.501
Guys, this is Emma.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.961
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:38.964 --> 30:40.629
She's a new face in town.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.758
Hi, Emma. Good to meet you.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.322
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

30:45.324 --> 30:46.993
Nice to meet you, Emma.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.917
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

30:50.919 --> 30:53.420
- Hello.
- Hi. Hi.

30:53.422 --> 30:56.061
Last cover of <i>Vogue,</i> amazing.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.800
Stylish, beautiful, wonderful.

30:57.802 --> 30:59.816
Absolutely.

30:59.818 --> 31:02.909
Sorry, I, I just don't
see what that fuss is about.

31:02.911 --> 31:04.891
What, what's your problem?

31:04.893 --> 31:06.594
Oh, come on,
she looks amazing.

31:06.596 --> 31:08.367
I'm fed up with those teeth,
you know?

31:08.369 --> 31:10.728
- Oh, you mean the gap.
- Yeah, the gap.

31:10.730 --> 31:12.640
It's been done,
don't you think so?

31:12.642 --> 31:13.718
- No.
- No?

31:13.720 --> 31:14.760
No, it's great.

31:14.763 --> 31:17.021
It's different,
it's wonderful.

31:17.023 --> 31:18.377
I hear that dentists,

31:18.379 --> 31:20.391
they are starting
to make them now.

31:20.393 --> 31:22.824
- Can you imagine?
- You mean, like, fake gaps?

31:22.826 --> 31:24.876
Yeah. They're
making fake gaps

31:24.878 --> 31:26.613
- at the dentist.
- Yeah, that's weird.

31:26.615 --> 31:27.969
We're living in
Bizarro World.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.324
Yeah, okay, come on.

31:29.326 --> 31:31.375
Can you just please
shut up for one second?

31:31.377 --> 31:32.626
Just think about,

31:32.628 --> 31:35.684
you're a girl,
in the middle of nowhere,

31:35.686 --> 31:37.388
you don't know anything
about the life,

31:37.390 --> 31:39.334
and then, you know,
you feel, like,

31:39.336 --> 31:41.594
uncomfortable because
you have ugly teeth,

31:41.596 --> 31:44.269
and then suddenly
you see Laura Stone

31:44.271 --> 31:46.806
on the cover of <i>Vogue</i> magazine.

31:46.808 --> 31:48.893
And then, what, she think,

31:48.895 --> 31:50.666
"Ah, maybe something can change,

31:50.668 --> 31:52.577
maybe something can happen."

31:52.579 --> 31:53.723
Then she say to herself,

31:53.725 --> 31:56.088
"I need to throw up my lunch."

31:56.090 --> 31:57.999
"I'm never eating
again, I promise."

31:58.001 --> 31:59.597
- Oh, shut up!
- Shut up.

31:59.599 --> 32:01.578
No, she think, "Okay,
I have ugly teeth,

32:01.580 --> 32:04.811
but I can do something
of my life, and change."

32:04.814 --> 32:07.069
There you go. That's
very sweet of you to think.

32:07.071 --> 32:08.704
It's true!

32:08.706 --> 32:10.684
You really believe that
Laura Stone and <i>Vogue</i>

32:10.686 --> 32:13.186
making girls feel more
secure about themselves?

32:13.189 --> 32:14.265
Yeah, I do.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.620
- Right?
- Yeah.

32:15.622 --> 32:17.045
- No kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

32:17.047 --> 32:19.271
Come on,
virtuous <i>Vogue,</i>

32:19.273 --> 32:21.529
absolutely. Yeah.

32:21.531 --> 32:23.165
Yeah, I agree.

32:24.658 --> 32:26.813
Yeah, I mean, I grew
up in a small town too,

32:26.815 --> 32:29.350
and back home everybody
used to make fun of me

32:29.352 --> 32:31.885
because, you know, I had
these weird long legs and arms

32:31.888 --> 32:35.710
and small tits and wasn't
like the other girls.

32:35.713 --> 32:39.046
You know, they, they
would call me, um,

32:39.048 --> 32:43.078
like a, like a spider,
but like with wings?

32:43.080 --> 32:44.816
- You know?
- A crane fly?

32:44.818 --> 32:47.215
Yeah. And, you know,
when I told them

32:47.217 --> 32:49.891
that I wanted to become
a model and go to Paris,

32:49.893 --> 32:53.261
they all thought that,
you know, I was just a joke,

32:53.264 --> 32:57.433
that, um, they still
think that it's a joke.

32:57.435 --> 32:59.935
They don't believe
that I can do it.

32:59.938 --> 33:04.489
And they don't understand,
like, my parents.

33:04.491 --> 33:07.651
I mean, they don't believe
that I can do it, either.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.502
And, I don't know, they just,

33:10.504 --> 33:12.588
they don't understand why people
would take pictures of me,

33:12.590 --> 33:16.414
because to them I just
look weird or something.

33:19.610 --> 33:21.175
Yeah, I mean...

33:24.163 --> 33:27.254
Well, if I didn't have this,

33:27.256 --> 33:29.654
I'd probably believe them too.

33:32.332 --> 33:33.720
You see?

33:33.722 --> 33:35.911
It's incredible,
but it's true.

33:38.274 --> 33:41.366
Shane, darling, where
did you find that girl?

33:41.368 --> 33:43.417
She's just amazing.

33:43.419 --> 33:46.231
Yes, listen to her.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.351
I think she found <i>me.</i>

33:48.353 --> 33:51.100
Aww...

33:53.777 --> 33:56.557
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, darling. Bye.

34:15.533 --> 34:17.132
One more drink?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.364
No, I'm okay.

34:35.311 --> 34:37.362
Crane fly?

35:00.231 --> 35:02.214
Take off your dress.

38:36.246 --> 38:38.574
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.518
What?

39:06.520 --> 39:08.049
Oh, for me?

39:28.276 --> 39:30.290
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

39:30.292 --> 39:32.480
I tried to call you.

39:32.482 --> 39:34.011
You have a guest.

41:38.789 --> 41:40.215
What?

41:41.360 --> 41:43.481
I'm not saying anything.

41:46.608 --> 41:48.659
But are you done now?

41:48.661 --> 41:53.384
I need to get
something in the room.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.399
Fuck.

41:59.401 --> 42:00.582
Hmm.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.691
These are so good.

42:09.063 --> 42:12.223
And you look fucking hot.

42:12.225 --> 42:13.613
She is hot.

42:13.615 --> 42:15.215
Very hot.

42:17.126 --> 42:20.009
- He's cute.
- What?

42:20.011 --> 42:23.206
He's cute.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.222
- What?
- Nothing.

42:25.224 --> 42:27.448
Sure?

42:27.450 --> 42:30.575
So, how did you and Emma meet?

42:30.577 --> 42:34.676
Uh, in school, actually.

42:34.678 --> 42:37.803
And that's two years
ago now, I think.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.377
But then she decided
to come to Paris.

42:40.379 --> 42:42.777
Yeah. Bad luck for me.

42:45.140 --> 42:47.432
But I understand why
she wants to try this out,

42:47.434 --> 42:50.145
it's... it's a great
opportunity for her.

42:51.882 --> 42:54.382
She'll be back at some point.

42:54.384 --> 42:56.572
How about you,
where are you from?

42:56.574 --> 42:58.798
I'm from Poland.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.822
I grew up there.

43:01.824 --> 43:05.090
I haven't been home in
the last five years.

43:05.092 --> 43:07.140
You don't miss home at all?

43:07.142 --> 43:09.502
No, not really.

43:09.504 --> 43:13.151
And I don't really have
the best relationship

43:13.153 --> 43:15.692
with my family, so...

43:17.359 --> 43:20.245
Hey, I'm in Paris, right?

43:22.260 --> 43:25.144
And you get new friends
when you travel.

43:25.146 --> 43:28.620
Like Emma.

43:28.622 --> 43:31.086
Yeah. Go conquer
the world, right?

43:31.089 --> 43:34.252
Yeah.
That's right, Frederik.

43:56.079 --> 43:58.791
I would do anything to
get a shot like that.

44:03.585 --> 44:05.913
So, what do you think?

44:05.915 --> 44:09.005
Should we go out tonight?

44:09.007 --> 44:10.572
I don't know.

44:10.574 --> 44:13.040
There is something
going on in your pub.

44:13.042 --> 44:14.776
We could go and get some drinks.

44:14.778 --> 44:17.834
I'm really tired,
so, it's, I don't...

44:17.836 --> 44:19.156
Shut up.

44:19.158 --> 44:21.138
We should go out,
show Frederik around,

44:21.140 --> 44:22.909
- have some fun.
- Yeah.

44:22.911 --> 44:24.441
I would like that.

44:26.283 --> 44:28.436
But we go there all the time,

44:28.439 --> 44:31.355
shouldn't we go somewhere
else tonight then?

44:31.357 --> 44:36.847
Darling, that's where
it's happening tonight.

44:36.849 --> 44:38.411
Thank you.

44:38.414 --> 44:39.666
I'll pay.

44:41.229 --> 44:42.650
- Sure.
- Are you sure?

44:42.652 --> 44:43.870
Yeah, I'm sure.

44:46.754 --> 44:48.630
There you go.

44:55.688 --> 44:56.971
Hey.

44:56.973 --> 44:58.361
Thought you were staying home.

44:58.364 --> 45:00.377
I changed my mind.

45:00.379 --> 45:02.360
Okay, cool.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.990
- Oh, sorry, you met Zofia?
- Hey, darling.

45:07.992 --> 45:09.831
- Hi.
- Mwah. How are you?

45:09.833 --> 45:11.394
I'm good, how are you?

45:11.396 --> 45:13.064
Same old, same old.

45:13.066 --> 45:16.089
- And, uh, this is Frederik.
- Hi.

45:16.091 --> 45:18.939
He's a friend, from back home.

45:18.941 --> 45:21.094
I'm Shane.
Nice to meet you, dude.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.622
Yeah,
nice to meet you, too.

45:22.624 --> 45:24.152
You guys gonna come
and sit down?

45:24.154 --> 45:25.751
We have a table.

45:25.753 --> 45:28.079
No, it's okay, we're
just gonna stay here.

45:28.081 --> 45:31.346
- Come on... Come sit down.
- It's okay.

45:31.348 --> 45:33.052
All the guys are here.
Come on.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.933
Cheers.

45:42.261 --> 45:43.720
I'm glad you came.

47:47.248 --> 47:50.513
- Everything's okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:50.515 --> 47:53.469
- With your friend?
- It's okay.

47:56.075 --> 47:57.916
Okay, well.

47:57.918 --> 47:59.483
Here's to a great night.

48:19.849 --> 48:22.178
- Good morning.
- Hey.

48:27.182 --> 48:29.857
I've got interesting news.

48:29.859 --> 48:32.707
<i>Harper's Bazaar</i> called
me this morning,

48:32.709 --> 48:35.767
and they want me to do
an editorial next week.

48:35.769 --> 48:37.367
Guess who I picked?

48:42.407 --> 48:45.394
Are you not happy?
This is a big fucking deal.

48:45.396 --> 48:48.660
- No, I am.
- Great.

48:48.663 --> 48:51.476
What are you doing this weekend?

48:51.478 --> 48:53.041
I don't know.

48:53.043 --> 48:55.717
My crazy mate is having
this big party, gathering,

48:55.719 --> 48:59.053
that he does every year
in his big fucking castle,

48:59.055 --> 49:02.911
and we're all flying
out there and...

49:02.914 --> 49:04.964
hoped we could go together.

49:07.084 --> 49:10.349
- Sounds good.
- Yeah?

49:10.351 --> 49:12.677
I mean, you can ask
your friend Zofia and her pal

49:12.679 --> 49:15.806
if they'd like to come
as well, and...

49:15.808 --> 49:17.371
Great.

49:17.373 --> 49:19.076
Settled then.

49:28.703 --> 49:30.336
Oh, this is Olivia.

49:32.110 --> 49:33.431
My daughter.

49:36.002 --> 49:37.288
Come.

49:39.304 --> 49:41.457
This is Emma.

49:41.459 --> 49:42.639
Say hello.

49:42.641 --> 49:44.968
- Hello.
- Hey.

49:44.970 --> 49:47.086
Can you say hello nicely?

49:47.089 --> 49:49.279
Hello.

49:58.838 --> 50:00.715
Eat properly, Olivia.

50:06.136 --> 50:07.664
No, of course not.

50:07.666 --> 50:09.926
Speak English, we have a guest.

50:15.485 --> 50:17.120
Stop.

50:20.178 --> 50:21.674
That's <i>enough.</i>

50:26.053 --> 50:27.477
Stop, Olivia.

50:41.693 --> 50:42.976
Yes?

50:42.978 --> 50:44.436
Can I come in?

50:44.439 --> 50:45.552
Yeah.

50:53.648 --> 50:54.692
Hi.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.919
What you did was not very nice.

51:09.915 --> 51:11.859
Did Frederik sleep here?

51:11.861 --> 51:13.284
Yeah.

51:13.286 --> 51:15.858
But he left early.

51:18.570 --> 51:22.427
I think he might have
gone to the airport.

51:22.429 --> 51:25.033
He left a note in the room.

51:25.035 --> 51:27.086
Maybe it said something.

52:11.018 --> 52:12.999
Did it say anything?

52:14.843 --> 52:15.954
No.

53:01.380 --> 53:02.494
Please.

53:05.343 --> 53:06.522
Nice to meet you.

53:06.524 --> 53:09.965
- Gerard.
- Emma.

53:16.152 --> 53:19.347
Okay, now that everybody
found his or her seats,

53:19.349 --> 53:22.651
um, we have this...
this little tradition

53:22.653 --> 53:25.430
that needs to be carried
out before eating.

53:25.432 --> 53:27.795
I know that this may
be a little surprising

53:27.797 --> 53:30.505
for some of you who
haven't been here before,

53:30.507 --> 53:33.772
um, so...

53:33.774 --> 53:37.040
in order to create
the right atmosphere,

53:37.042 --> 53:40.550
you need to kiss your dinner
partner before eating.

53:42.949 --> 53:44.791
Now, this is a tradition

53:44.793 --> 53:48.960
to loosen up, to be more open
towards meeting new people,

53:48.963 --> 53:52.714
and this should, of
course, be a real kiss.

53:52.716 --> 53:56.086
So, um, are you all ready?

53:56.089 --> 53:57.545
Yes.

53:57.547 --> 53:59.666
Okay!

53:59.668 --> 54:01.997
Well, you may begin.

54:07.698 --> 54:09.645
So we should kiss.

54:12.216 --> 54:13.675
Yeah?

54:48.293 --> 54:50.202
Hello, you.

54:50.204 --> 54:53.264
I'm tired.
When are we gonna go?

54:55.315 --> 54:57.468
I think I'm gonna
stay a little longer.

54:57.470 --> 54:59.417
But I won't be too long, okay?

55:02.091 --> 55:03.308
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:07.191 --> 56:10.178
Don't worry about it.

56:10.180 --> 56:13.724
It's been almost a year
since they were together.

56:13.726 --> 56:15.530
Who?

56:15.532 --> 56:20.016
Shane and that girl you
kept looking at all evening.

56:20.018 --> 56:21.823
Linda.

56:21.825 --> 56:24.915
You're his girlfriend
now, right?

56:24.917 --> 56:27.246
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't worry then.

56:29.436 --> 56:32.148
I would be seeing you
if I was him.

56:34.336 --> 56:37.222
You are beautiful,
you know that?

56:40.489 --> 56:43.443
- I'm Sebastian.
- Emma.

56:47.024 --> 56:50.810
And you're great in photos.
Amazing.

56:50.813 --> 56:53.033
You... you've seen
pictures of me?

56:53.035 --> 56:56.509
Of course. I would love for
you to walk for us sometime.

56:56.511 --> 56:58.459
Oh, what do you do?

56:59.882 --> 57:01.722
You're sweet.

57:01.724 --> 57:03.286
What?

57:03.289 --> 57:04.852
Should I know?

57:04.854 --> 57:06.589
Let's just say I, uh,

57:06.591 --> 57:10.727
I'm an executive at
a big French brand.

57:12.118 --> 57:14.618
Which brand?

57:14.620 --> 57:16.290
Chanel.

57:17.574 --> 57:19.066
No way.

57:19.068 --> 57:21.117
And I think you could
be our face someday.

57:21.119 --> 57:24.318
- Oh, stop.
- I mean it.

57:27.029 --> 57:29.217
I meet you girls all the time.

57:29.219 --> 57:32.449
Girls come into Paris
when they are very young,

57:32.451 --> 57:35.091
and I tell you this:

57:35.093 --> 57:37.904
You have it.

57:37.906 --> 57:41.070
I saw that right away
when I saw your book.

57:43.711 --> 57:48.126
Hey, I have something
we should try.

57:53.235 --> 57:57.577
- For you.
- I don't know...

57:57.579 --> 57:59.769
It's not too strong.

58:08.668 --> 58:10.128
Cheers.

58:33.379 --> 58:36.298
You wanna go have a swim?

58:36.300 --> 58:38.003
What, now?

58:40.088 --> 58:42.174
Come on,
let's check the pool out.

58:45.266 --> 58:46.623
You know where it is?

58:48.639 --> 58:50.095
Okay.

58:50.097 --> 58:53.850
Go get changed, I'll meet
you there in ten minutes.

58:53.852 --> 58:56.422
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

58:56.424 --> 58:58.161
Oh, sure it is.

01:00:22.203 --> 01:00:24.982
I don't
know if we should...

01:00:24.984 --> 01:00:26.826
be doing this.

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:05.805
I'm sorry.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:14.457
I fucked up, I know.

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:21.060
I got stayin' in the
garden house, and...

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:22.763
I'm sorry.

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.849
I was comin' back, but...

01:03:24.851 --> 01:03:28.255
I saw the guys, and they
invited me to go and play pool,

01:03:28.257 --> 01:03:32.426
and they had this
bottle of whiskey.

01:03:32.428 --> 01:03:35.483
I fell asleep on the sofa.

01:03:35.485 --> 01:03:36.773
I'm sorry.

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:42.088
It's not true.

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.756
Yes, it is.

01:03:43.758 --> 01:03:46.538
No, it's not.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.430
You were talking with your
ex-girlfriend all night.

01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:53.210
That Linda.

01:03:53.213 --> 01:03:57.173
I came down to look for you
and you just left with her.

01:03:57.175 --> 01:03:58.772
No, I didn't.

01:03:58.774 --> 01:04:02.281
She left and went to sleep,
I went with the guys. Um...

01:04:02.283 --> 01:04:04.297
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about her,

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.532
but I don't have anything
to do with her anymore.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.681
I don't believe you.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.901
It's the truth.

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.424
I know this weekend
wasn't everything

01:04:20.426 --> 01:04:23.205
it was supposed to be.

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:25.465
Baby, I fucked up.

01:04:25.467 --> 01:04:28.039
I'll make it up
to you, I promise.

01:04:29.985 --> 01:04:32.938
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.470
Don't say that.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.436
Emma?

01:04:47.711 --> 01:04:49.449
Emma?

01:04:57.305 --> 01:04:58.831
Come outside,
I need to talk to you.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:01.230
- What?
- You know what this is about.

01:05:01.232 --> 01:05:02.932
Come outside now.

01:05:02.934 --> 01:05:04.532
Put your fucking spoon down.

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:06.376
I said stand up.

01:05:13.014 --> 01:05:14.681
Okay, hold it.

01:05:14.683 --> 01:05:16.767
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Guys, guys.

01:05:16.769 --> 01:05:18.434
What the fuck's
going on here?

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:20.973
Shane.

01:05:20.975 --> 01:05:22.503
All right, easy, easy, easy.

01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:26.396
You okay, man?

01:05:30.776 --> 01:05:32.827
Everything's cool.

01:06:50.854 --> 01:06:53.079
<i>This is Shane White.
Leave a message.</i>

01:07:02.603 --> 01:07:05.660
<i>This is Shane White.
Leave a message.</i>

01:07:05.663 --> 01:07:07.711
Hi. Please...

01:07:07.714 --> 01:07:09.277
please call me.

01:07:59.744 --> 01:08:02.382
- I just don't get it.
- I know, baby.

01:08:02.384 --> 01:08:04.608
Listen, <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> is big,

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:07.179
but something else will come up.

01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:09.891
How can they just cancel,
like...

01:08:09.893 --> 01:08:11.385
Don't we have, like,
the contracts or...

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:15.522
No, baby, they can
do whatever they want.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.163
- I need to talk to them.
- No, you don't talk to anyone.

01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:20.176
And you <i>especially</i>
don't talk to him.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:21.881
- But I have to...
- No, Emma!

01:08:21.883 --> 01:08:23.932
- I have to tell him...
- This is going to make you,

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:27.060
this is going to
make <i>us</i> look bad.

01:08:27.064 --> 01:08:29.354
Look, honey,

01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.404
you're very talented, okay,

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.526
and you have a lot of good
things going on for right now,

01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:36.930
but this business is
also about, you know,

01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:38.634
how tough you can be.

01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:41.067
'Cause there's gonna
be so many temptations, and...

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:43.502
and people trying
to take advantage of you.

01:08:45.553 --> 01:08:47.428
I'm not trying to demonize
the fashion industry,

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.971
'cause it's my life, but...

01:08:50.974 --> 01:08:53.649
I'm just saying...

01:08:53.652 --> 01:08:57.783
what's the point of being on
the cover of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>

01:08:57.786 --> 01:08:59.630
if you're not happy?

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:04.252
That's just a
fucking cliché, Marcel.

01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:08.319
Yeah, perhaps.

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:11.584
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:13.183
Come here.

01:09:13.185 --> 01:09:15.825
It'll be okay, we'll
find you something else.

01:09:15.827 --> 01:09:17.425
Don't worry.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.229
- Um, excuse me?
- Yes?

01:09:32.231 --> 01:09:34.209
The <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> shoot?

01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:36.783
- It's up there.
- Okay, thanks.

01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:49.086
Emma.

01:09:49.089 --> 01:09:50.791
Hey, Mi.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.772
What are you doing here?

01:09:52.774 --> 01:09:54.927
- Didn't you get the message?
- Yeah.

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.282
It's just...

01:09:56.284 --> 01:09:58.854
You... You can't be here.

01:09:58.856 --> 01:10:00.452
I just need to speak to him.

01:10:00.454 --> 01:10:02.225
No, Emma, come on.

01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:03.755
Please, don't make it worse.

01:10:03.757 --> 01:10:06.534
- Just really quick...
- No, Emma, go home.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.995
We're working here.

01:10:07.997 --> 01:10:09.941
Shane? Shane!

01:10:09.943 --> 01:10:11.021
Shane!

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:16.753
What the fuck you doing here?

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:19.152
Why won't you call me?

01:10:19.154 --> 01:10:20.927
Why do you think?

01:10:22.422 --> 01:10:24.403
Let's talk next door, come on.

01:10:33.543 --> 01:10:35.629
Please, give me
another chance.

01:10:37.158 --> 01:10:38.893
Don't do this Emma, please.

01:10:38.895 --> 01:10:40.877
You know I'm sorry.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.074
Please?

01:10:45.639 --> 01:10:47.584
It's not gonna work.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.556
You need to leave. Now.

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.657
Now.

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:00.964
Are you fucking her now?

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:02.285
That's it. Come on, let's go.

01:11:02.288 --> 01:11:03.536
Are you fucking her?!

01:11:03.539 --> 01:11:05.308
- Let's go.
- Bitch!

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:07.463
Shane. Shane.

01:11:07.465 --> 01:11:09.583
- Just...
- You're making things worse.

01:11:09.585 --> 01:11:11.117
Please.

01:11:20.047 --> 01:11:21.092
Please.

01:11:24.009 --> 01:11:25.852
It's over.

01:11:28.077 --> 01:11:29.363
Please.

01:11:30.544 --> 01:11:32.179
Go home.

01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:40.101
Shane.

01:11:40.103 --> 01:11:41.770
Shane...

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.397
Emma?

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.907
Emma?

01:12:00.818 --> 01:12:02.938
It's almost two o'clock.

01:12:40.093 --> 01:12:42.943
- Okay, merci.
- Au revoir.

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:46.453
Bonjour.

01:12:49.268 --> 01:12:52.395
Excuse me, uh, where's the...

01:12:52.397 --> 01:12:55.001
personal hygiene area?

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:57.263
- There.
- Thank you.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:35.249
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.304
What's wrong?

01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:42.517
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

01:13:45.471 --> 01:13:49.433
I took a test,
and it was positive.

01:13:51.172 --> 01:13:52.769
Wow.

01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:54.471
You sure it's mine?

01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:57.043
Yeah, of course it is.

01:13:57.045 --> 01:13:59.128
Okay.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.248
Okay.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.890
I know somewhere we
can get this sorted.

01:14:03.892 --> 01:14:06.184
We'll get a proper examination
and we'll get it fixed.

01:14:06.186 --> 01:14:08.826
I don't know if I
want to get it fixed.

01:14:08.828 --> 01:14:10.704
Excuse me?

01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.422
No.

01:14:14.424 --> 01:14:15.984
You need to stop
this talk right now.

01:14:15.986 --> 01:14:18.383
You can't have a baby,
you're 18 years old.

01:14:18.385 --> 01:14:20.504
And we're not even together,
what are you gonna do,

01:14:20.506 --> 01:14:22.245
raise it by yourself?

01:14:26.623 --> 01:14:28.360
I'm 16.

01:14:30.969 --> 01:14:33.121
Excuse me?

01:14:33.123 --> 01:14:35.104
What?

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:38.372
You told me you were 18.

01:14:47.026 --> 01:14:49.144
Oh, man.

01:14:49.146 --> 01:14:51.229
This is a hundred percent,
we need to get this fixed.

01:14:51.231 --> 01:14:54.809
We are not having this
baby, there's no way.

01:14:54.811 --> 01:14:55.885
No one can find out about this,

01:14:55.888 --> 01:14:58.461
no one can hear my name.

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:05.865
Come here.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.420
I'm sorry this got so fucked up.

01:15:27.935 --> 01:15:29.708
I'll get it fixed.

01:15:35.059 --> 01:15:36.243
Okay.

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:43.435
Can I come up with you?

01:15:46.633 --> 01:15:49.134
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

01:15:49.136 --> 01:15:51.288
Please?

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:53.376
I don't feel good.

01:15:58.938 --> 01:16:00.224
Okay.

01:16:32.339 --> 01:16:34.631
Okay, let's take the
same again, but faster.

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:37.134
Go, go, go, go go go, go.

01:16:37.136 --> 01:16:39.254
All right, yeah.

01:16:39.256 --> 01:16:42.972
Faster, and this time...

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:45.163
Go!

01:16:47.493 --> 01:16:50.132
Yes, lovely.

01:16:50.134 --> 01:16:52.291
Okay......

01:16:54.479 --> 01:16:57.884
Three, two, one.

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:03.238
Okay. Bellissima!

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.949
Can you keep a secret?

01:17:27.951 --> 01:17:29.650
Of course.

01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:32.604
I'm back together with Shane.

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:34.934
What?

01:17:34.936 --> 01:17:36.083
I...

01:17:38.898 --> 01:17:42.164
I told him I was pregnant.

01:17:42.166 --> 01:17:43.764
I'm... I'm not pregnant.

01:17:43.766 --> 01:17:45.430
I thought I was, but I'm not,

01:17:45.432 --> 01:17:47.553
I just... I told him anyway.

01:17:49.813 --> 01:17:51.550
Why?

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.495
To... To get him back.

01:18:03.089 --> 01:18:05.557
I missed him so much.

01:19:00.646 --> 01:19:03.218
Can't you just call
and say you can't make it?

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.966
It's just an hour.
I'll be quick.

01:20:14.297 --> 01:20:16.417
You're not pregnant.

01:20:21.597 --> 01:20:24.447
- Yes, I am.
- Don't fucking lie to me.

01:20:32.057 --> 01:20:33.796
What's wrong with you?

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.044
You're sick, you know that?

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.185
You're not well.

01:20:44.188 --> 01:20:46.341
How could you lie about
something like that?

01:20:46.343 --> 01:20:49.156
- It's not a lie.
- Shut up.

01:20:49.158 --> 01:20:51.834
Why'd you tell me
you were pregnant?

01:20:56.215 --> 01:20:58.575
What?

01:20:58.577 --> 01:21:01.635
You fuckin' disgust me,
you know that?

01:21:06.919 --> 01:21:08.519
I want you to leave now.

01:21:12.758 --> 01:21:14.393
Out now.

01:21:16.513 --> 01:21:19.846
- Can't...
- Out!

01:21:19.848 --> 01:21:21.692
Let's go!

01:21:23.219 --> 01:21:24.329
No.

01:21:24.331 --> 01:21:26.697
No!

01:21:28.502 --> 01:21:31.072
Look, here's a piece of advice:
Go back to Denmark

01:21:31.074 --> 01:21:33.370
and sort your fuckin' head out.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:04.196
<i>Hi, this is Zofia,
leave a message.</i>

01:22:04.198 --> 01:22:07.363
Call me. I need
to talk to you now.

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:11.243
- You're late.
- Yeah, sorry.

01:23:11.245 --> 01:23:13.884
Get ready.

01:23:13.886 --> 01:23:15.031
Emma, hi.

01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:16.389
Let's go.

01:23:43.672 --> 01:23:44.750
Ready?

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:48.746
Please look into the camera.

01:23:48.748 --> 01:23:50.069
Into the camera.

01:23:52.988 --> 01:23:54.725
Okay, good.

01:23:56.846 --> 01:24:00.006
Emma, please, okay?
I'm gonna need you to focus.

01:24:00.008 --> 01:24:02.440
All right? For five minutes.

01:24:02.442 --> 01:24:04.945
Les, can you... can you please
do something?

01:24:09.150 --> 01:24:10.853
Can you see the last one?

01:24:13.773 --> 01:24:16.067
You're Emma, right?

01:24:19.819 --> 01:24:23.016
And, uh, Shane White,
the photographer,

01:24:23.018 --> 01:24:25.448
he's your boyfriend?

01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:26.771
Yes.

01:24:29.309 --> 01:24:32.226
And, uh, Zofia Baga,
the model,

01:24:32.228 --> 01:24:35.075
she's your friend?

01:24:35.077 --> 01:24:37.334
Yeah.

01:24:37.336 --> 01:24:39.666
We live together, so...

01:24:45.678 --> 01:24:49.569
I just wanted to let you
know something I heard.

01:24:49.571 --> 01:24:52.317
Everybody's talking about this.

01:24:52.319 --> 01:24:54.508
They are seeing each other.

01:24:58.609 --> 01:24:59.722
What?

01:25:01.249 --> 01:25:06.395
I know Mika, Shane's
assistant, and she also told me.

01:25:08.897 --> 01:25:12.164
I'm sorry, I just decided
you should know that.

01:25:21.027 --> 01:25:23.215
Thank you, sweetie.

01:25:23.217 --> 01:25:24.952
Five minutes,
five minutes.

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:26.655
What are you doing?

01:25:26.657 --> 01:25:28.988
Hey,
where are you going?

01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:08.956
What?

01:26:12.327 --> 01:26:13.646
What are you doing?

01:26:13.648 --> 01:26:15.423
Are you fucking Shane?

01:26:16.534 --> 01:26:18.027
Are you fucking him?

01:26:18.029 --> 01:26:19.311
What are you doing, stop it.

01:26:19.314 --> 01:26:21.538
You are fucking Shane!

01:26:38.882 --> 01:26:40.479
Stop, stop!

01:26:40.481 --> 01:26:43.226
- Hey, stop.
- She is fucking him!

01:26:48.405 --> 01:26:50.107
Sit down.

01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:52.714
All right, all right,
take it easy, huh?

01:26:52.716 --> 01:26:55.494
Calm down, calm down, all right.

01:26:55.496 --> 01:26:56.782
You stay here.

01:27:23.964 --> 01:27:25.558
Here.

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.542
Take it, please.

01:27:28.724 --> 01:27:30.080
Here.

01:27:42.314 --> 01:27:43.775
One more.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.685
So, what's happened?

01:29:09.972 --> 01:29:12.227
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi.

01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:14.799
I'm walking
you home today.

01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:16.367
Okay.

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:24.014
Come on, let's sit. Come.

01:29:39.131 --> 01:29:40.870
No, stay.

01:29:44.554 --> 01:29:47.438
Is Shane seeing my friend Zofia?

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.906
Has she been to your apartment?

01:29:52.201 --> 01:29:55.118
Is he fucking her? Tell me!

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.624
I... I don't know.

01:30:53.546 --> 01:30:56.466
- This is shit.
- No, it's not.

01:31:09.119 --> 01:31:11.447
Why do you look
at me in the shower?

01:31:13.914 --> 01:31:15.686
Think I'm pretty?

01:31:40.954 --> 01:31:42.415
Can I sit?

01:31:44.814 --> 01:31:46.308
Yes.

01:32:20.265 --> 01:32:21.933
Good night.

01:33:45.905 --> 01:33:47.644
No. No.

01:33:56.436 --> 01:33:58.142
Please.

01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:19.132
No, don't, I don't want to.

01:34:19.134 --> 01:34:20.559
No.

01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:26.778
- No. No. No.
- Please.

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.241
No.

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.367
No.

01:34:33.072 --> 01:34:34.702
No, no.

01:34:36.095 --> 01:34:38.840
No.

01:34:38.842 --> 01:34:40.784
No, no, no.

01:34:45.584 --> 01:34:49.300
Ow, stop, stop, stop!
Stop.

01:35:01.573 --> 01:35:03.343
Stop.

01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:44.427
I'm sorry.

01:36:23.215 --> 01:36:25.024
I'm really sorry.

01:37:32.209 --> 01:37:34.991
You have to help me.
I stabbed someone with a knife.

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:41.036
No, but you have to help me.
I stabbed him with a knife.

01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:31.717
Hi, Marcel?

01:41:31.719 --> 01:41:34.461
<i>Hi, you. How are you?</i>

01:41:34.464 --> 01:41:35.679
I'm okay.

01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:38.877
<i>Yeah, did you
get back all right?</i>

01:41:38.879 --> 01:41:42.073
Yeah, I'm home now, so.

01:41:42.075 --> 01:41:44.576
<i>Well I'm glad
everything is all right there.</i>

01:41:44.578 --> 01:41:47.914
<i>You got back, and you're safe.</i>

01:41:47.916 --> 01:41:49.652
Thanks.

01:41:49.654 --> 01:41:51.319
<i>I heard that
he got out of the hospital</i>

01:41:51.321 --> 01:41:54.759
<i>and he's been officially
charged now, so...</i>

01:41:54.761 --> 01:41:57.541
<i>Well, that's good, right?</i>

01:41:57.543 --> 01:41:59.591
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:41:59.593 --> 01:42:03.138
<i>Listen, I... I just wanted
to tell you something,</i>

01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.528
<i>we got this call
today at the office.</i>

01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:06.577
<i>Now, I know it
doesn't matter now,</i>

01:42:06.579 --> 01:42:09.079
<i>with everything
that's happened, but...</i>

01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:11.583
<i>Chanel wants you to walk
their haute couture show</i>

01:42:11.585 --> 01:42:13.773
<i>here at the Fashion Week.</i>

01:42:13.775 --> 01:42:15.754
<i>But they asked for
you, specifically,</i>

01:42:15.756 --> 01:42:19.299
<i>they... they love you.</i>

01:42:19.301 --> 01:42:21.490
<i>Well, I just wanted
to let you know.</i>

01:42:21.492 --> 01:42:23.888
<i>I said that you probably
wouldn't be able to do it,</i>

01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:26.006
<i>that you went back, and,</i>

01:42:26.008 --> 01:42:27.992
<i>well, they were
very disappointed.</i>

01:42:29.449 --> 01:42:31.013
<i>I thought you'd like to know.</i>

01:42:31.015 --> 01:42:33.726
<i>Maybe it could, you know,
cheer you up.</i>

01:42:35.428 --> 01:42:38.485
<i>I was right to tell them
you couldn't do it, right?</i>

01:42:38.488 --> 01:42:41.439
<i>I mean, there's no chance
that you could come down here</i>

01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:43.666
<i>and... and do the show?</i>

01:42:44.779 --> 01:42:46.273
<i>Uh, Emma?</i>

01:42:48.775 --> 01:42:50.097
<i>Emma?</i>

01:42:51.728 --> 01:42:53.571
<i>Emma, are you there?</i>

01:42:55.935 --> 01:42:57.604
<i>Emma?</i>

01:42:59.076 --> 01:43:01.980
