00:28.528 --> 00:31.258
# Oh, when we wake in the morning #

00:31.264 --> 00:33.425
# GirIfriend, you know you wiII have
known me #

00:36.269 --> 00:41.263
#And high on a hiIItop, up on a hot
rock You own me #

00:43.376 --> 00:46.243
#You got the right size pepper shaker #

00:46.246 --> 00:48.441
# Come on, Iet's get our wheeIs on #

00:48.515 --> 00:50.449
# But you give me pause #

00:57.257 --> 00:59.384
#You been Iooking so hard, so hard #

00:59.426 --> 01:01.394
Dad, dinner's aImost ready!

01:01.528 --> 01:05.224
#You been Iooking so hard, yeah #

01:10.437 --> 01:14.271
#You been Iooking so hard, so hard, so
hard #

01:14.307 --> 01:15.433
# Baby, you better #

01:15.475 --> 01:18.273
#You better pIay your card #

01:18.311 --> 01:22.372
# Hey, no more driving for you, yeah #

01:22.415 --> 01:25.475
#You're so supercharged, hey #

01:25.518 --> 01:29.386
# No need to Iook so hard, yeah #

01:54.280 --> 01:56.441
Dad? Oh, my God! Dad?

01:59.452 --> 02:01.249
Dad?

02:02.355 --> 02:03.481
Dad?

03:03.283 --> 03:05.342
New OrIeans can be a tough town to
die in.

03:06.319 --> 03:10.449
But when you die and come back, you call
me. DYLAN: Dog.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.254
Or at Ieast you did.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.386
You see, I used to protect aII of them,

03:17.430 --> 03:19.261
aII those creatures of the night.

03:19.465 --> 03:22.400
Those sharp-toothed monsters you thought
were onIy in the movies.

03:23.436 --> 03:26.269
Why? Because they're reaI.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.340
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.274
I used to think the same thing.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.468
But go ahead.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.536
Take a cIoser Iook at that bum begging
for change.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.282
Take a Iook at your neighbor your best
friend.

03:38.451 --> 03:41.352
HeII, maybe even your girIfriend.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.218
The undead are out there, hiding in
pIain sight.

03:46.426 --> 03:50.487
And in my day, I was the Iine between
you and them.

03:51.331 --> 03:54.528
I was the peace, the cork in the bottIe,
the Iine in the sand.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.260
But then everything changed.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.272
And I discovered there 's more than one
way to die.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.408
Your heart can go on ticking, but
sometimes,

04:05.478 --> 04:07.309
that's just for show.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.455
But fIesh-eating monsters weren't my
probIem anymore.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.461
I had moved on to a much safer Iine of
work.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.277
You think you can just ruin peopIe's
Iives and get away with it?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.473
You cocked the gun too earIy.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.343
What?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.414
Shove a gun in somebody's face, that's
shock enough.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.348
You want to save the gun-cooking tiII
Iater.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.294
In case the gun itseIf doesn't put enough
fear into the guy.

04:57.363 --> 05:01.231
You've aIready done that. Now what do
you do?

05:02.335 --> 05:03.393
Shake it at me?

05:05.471 --> 05:08.235
See? HardIy effective, right?

05:09.275 --> 05:12.369
But if you save the gun-cooking untiI
Iater, boom.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.505
Then you've got escaIation.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.315
And that, my friend, is the name of the
game.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.448
AII right. So, why are you here?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.519
I'm here to put a buIIet in your head.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.485
Not ringing beIIs.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.461
You're gonna have to heIp me with this
one, Chief.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.429
Who are you again?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.233
Oh, right. You're the one with the
screamer

05:36.536 --> 05:39.300
Those pictures are gonna cost me
everything.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.339
The four-bedroom, five-bath house

05:41.374 --> 05:43.274
with the pooI and the tennis court,

05:43.343 --> 05:44.469
and the Mercedes S-CIass!

05:46.379 --> 05:48.244
It's never pretty when Iove dies.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.440
What wouId you know about it?

05:54.387 --> 05:57.254
You know, I think you missed something
in these photos.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.457
Yeah, you shouId check this out.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.285
See right here?

06:04.530 --> 06:05.497
What did I miss?

06:06.466 --> 06:07.433
Oh, God!

06:08.501 --> 06:10.298
I think you broke my nose!

06:10.403 --> 06:11.461
CaIm down, big baby.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.234
It's not broken.

06:13.272 --> 06:16.435
Now, I know you're upset with me, but
I'm just doing my job.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.376
You were the one power-thrusting your
secretary.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.276
Executive assistant.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.302
Whatever.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.315
You do the crime, pay the fine.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.483
But

06:27.353 --> 06:30.322
she cheated on me first.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.457
God.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.418
You don't need revenge.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.453
You need proof.

06:37.497 --> 06:41.331
Audio. Pictures. Video, if possibIe.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.530
I get 250 a day, pIus expenses.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.499
You wouIdn't happen to have a check with
you?

06:49.542 --> 06:51.407
Do you take credit cards?

06:59.285 --> 07:00.309
DyIan!

07:00.353 --> 07:03.220
Did that guy just have a gun?

07:06.492 --> 07:07.459
Here.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.360
What is this? You're gonna Iike it.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.355
It's something for us to keep up with the
competition.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.423
Marcus.

07:14.467 --> 07:18.494
DyIan, Iisten, there's three key
ingredients to Iife and business, okay?

07:18.504 --> 07:21.371
I caII it YEL. it's yearning, earning,
and Iearning.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.466
You know, you reaIIy gotta stop watching
those infomeroiaIs.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.278
Yeah, and you need to evoIve, man.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.311
I'm sorry, there's a revoIution going
on, DyIan.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.474
It's caIIed "digitaI," aII right?

07:29.515 --> 07:31.346
There are certain parts of the worId

07:31.384 --> 07:32.476
that consider fiIm kind of oId.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.249
Sounds Iike paradise.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.415
WeII, I used your credit card, so I
hope you Iike it.

07:37.523 --> 07:38.512
Huh?

07:39.325 --> 07:43.261
Hey. Have you thought about that
conversation we had a coupIe weeks ago?

07:43.429 --> 07:45.226
At aII?

07:48.401 --> 07:50.266
DyIan, DyIan. Look.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.201
Now I'm not saying that getting your maiI

07:53.272 --> 07:57.265
and deveIoping your antiquated fiIm stock
isn't a bIast.

07:57.510 --> 08:03.244
But, frankIy, I can do more, man. I
want to do more, okay?

08:03.282 --> 08:04.476
I thought this was about cases of Iife
and death,

08:04.517 --> 08:07.486
not cheating husbands and insurance
fraud.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.447
I want to be your go-to guy, DyIan.

08:09.455 --> 08:12.219
I don't want to be your go-get guy
anymore.

08:13.259 --> 08:14.317
I want to be your partner.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.456
Marcus, I toId you.

08:20.366 --> 08:21.492
I can't have a partner.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.265
I'm sorry.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.368
No, that's cooI, man.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.532
Hey, speaking of cheating husbands,

08:29.542 --> 08:31.407
the CoIIins photos.

08:31.544 --> 08:33.239
Oh.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.371
Yeah. Wow.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.438
Is that even anatomicaIIy possibIe?

08:36.482 --> 08:38.279
Yeah, you do not want to know what

08:38.284 --> 08:39.342
I crawIed through to get this picture.

08:40.318 --> 08:42.344
Oh, hey, you got a caII today.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.481
Lady in the Garden District. Said she
needs to taIk to you.

08:45.424 --> 08:46.448
You hear that?

08:46.459 --> 08:47.426
No. What?

08:48.327 --> 08:51.296
That, my friend, is our fees going up.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.432
The New OrIeans Garden District,

08:54.467 --> 08:56.332
where the rich go to Iive in styIe.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.266
On in this case, die in styIe.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.397
Nice first impression.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.272
Might be time for a new car, man.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.504
Hey. It's a cIassic,

09:06.379 --> 09:08.244
and you go before the oar goes.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.509
Understand? Yeah, right. Yep.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.479
You know those guys?

09:15.321 --> 09:16.379
In another Iife.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.413
First thing you Iearn about uptown
cases?

09:19.258 --> 09:20.418
They aIways end up downtown.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.393
If I'd have known where this one was
heading,

09:22.395 --> 09:24.260
I wouId have turned it down in a
heartbeat.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.331
But you know what they say about
hindsight

09:26.532 --> 09:28.329
it'II screw you every time.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.301
Hi. Can I heIp you?

09:30.436 --> 09:32.461
No. That's what I do.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.307
I'm DyIan.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.377
I'm not reaIIy sure how we do this.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.276
I've never met a private investigator.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.478
WeII, why don't you just teII us why
we're here?

09:50.356 --> 09:51.380
My father...

09:51.424 --> 09:53.449
Let me guess. Skipped out on the famiIy?

09:53.459 --> 09:54.517
He was murdered.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.363
And he wouId never do that. So...

10:00.466 --> 10:02.297
So, you're Iooking at "the famiIy."

10:03.436 --> 10:04.494
CondoIences.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.535
So, what do our friends in bIue have to
say about it?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.273
They didn't hear a word I said.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.275
They don't beIieve me. They don't
beIieve my story.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.337
They're parked outside just to convince
the neighbors

10:15.381 --> 10:16.507
that they're safe. What?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.374
Why do you think we wiII?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.281
After the funeraI, the priest gave me
this.

10:30.396 --> 10:33.229
I don't do that sort of thing anymore.
Sorry for the confusion.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.493
Marcus? What just happened?

10:34.533 --> 10:37.229
My father was kiIIed by some kind of
monster.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.294
Look, miss, in a moment of trauma, the
mind can pIay tricks.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.398
Don't give me that crap. I saw it with
my own eyes.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.342
It was huge, thick fur, massive cIaws.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.436
Sorry, but an investigator isn't the
type of heIp you need.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.379
I knew you were buIIshit.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.284
We'II be in touch. Sorry for your Ioss!
Thank you for your time.

10:55.454 --> 10:57.319
Damn it, DyIan! What the heII, man?

10:58.257 --> 10:59.281
That girI's in troubIe.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.316
No, that girI is troubIe. it's not our
probIem.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.328
Sure. Her father's dead. She's
traumatized.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.330
She's aII aIone. She needs our heIp!

11:05.364 --> 11:06.388
Drop it, Marcus. End of discussion.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.333
Okay, stop, Iisten. HoId on, aII
right? DyIan, Iisten.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.427
This is the first reaI case we've seen in
years.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.234
Okay, someone who actuaIIy needs our
heIp.

11:14.273 --> 11:15.467
This is exactIy what I'm taIking about.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.408
Something different, something better!

11:17.443 --> 11:18.501
Don't you want that?

11:18.544 --> 11:20.375
No, I don't No, you don't

11:20.379 --> 11:22.347
Because things in Iife don't get better,
aII right?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.349
They either stay the same, or they get a
Iot worse.

11:24.383 --> 11:27.284
Five, 10, 20 years from now, I want
every day to be the same.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.287
That's my pIan. See you tomorrow.

11:30.322 --> 11:33.257
Good pIan. Good. AII right. Yeah,
I'II see you tomorrow.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.258
I'II just waIk then, huh?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.264
"No puIse? No probIem." What?

11:42.501 --> 11:44.332
That doesn't even make any sense.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.279
Corpus House, the hottest cIub in
town.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.411
A vampire den seIIing the new drug
absoIuteIy everyone wants.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.446
Keeps you up aII night, gives you the
strength of 10 men.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.518
It makes you feeI Iike you couId Iive
forever.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.386
Leave it to vampires to market their own
bIood as a thriII ride.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.437
How much? 450.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.398
You've had enough aIready, Roddy.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.304
I'II Iet you know when I had enough,
okay?

12:36.489 --> 12:37.456
Roddy!

12:41.360 --> 12:42.384
Roddy!

12:42.428 --> 12:43.395
Shut up!

12:49.401 --> 12:50.368
Yeah!

12:55.541 --> 12:56.508
Vargas.

12:59.411 --> 13:00.503
There was a werewoIf murder Iast night.

13:01.547 --> 13:05.415
An importer named AIfred Ryan. CiviIian.

13:07.353 --> 13:10.322
PeopIe die, Lorca. Get over it.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.415
This one's different.

13:12.491 --> 13:15.358
ApparentIy, the woIves at Port Authority
caught wind of something

13:15.394 --> 13:17.259
being brought over from the oId country.

13:17.496 --> 13:18.463
The Heart.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.460
Go check it out.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.338
Goddamn breathers.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.346
Hotshot. Party's over.

13:39.351 --> 13:40.477
I'm just getting started.

13:50.462 --> 13:51.429
Yeah!

14:00.439 --> 14:02.304
Someone needs a timeout.

14:13.319 --> 14:14.308
Carry on.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.352
Hey, DyIan.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.481
Hey, man, I wanted to apoIogize for
earIier.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.354
I shouIdn't have said aII that stuff,
man.

14:53.425 --> 14:57.361
I mean, it's not my business, and I
feeI Iike I overstepped my boundaries.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.331
So, I'm sorry.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.389
And I'm sure you're right, too.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.301
She was probabIy just a nut job, some
kind of whack-a-moIe.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.428
What was she taIking about, anyway?

15:06.472 --> 15:10.408
I mean, it was Iike something, some big
beast with big fangs and big...

16:03.429 --> 16:04.396
Marcus?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.431
Marcus?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.345
AII right. Let's see what we got.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.317
Jesus Christ!

16:26.518 --> 16:31.251
Is it me, or does it Iook Iike something
took a bite outta this guy?

16:34.293 --> 16:35.260
Sorry.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.433
With aII the dead bodies I'd seen
in my day,

16:42.468 --> 16:44.493
you'd think this wouId've been easier.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.463
But it wasn't.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.466
was my friend.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.426
I thought I 'd Ieft my past behind, but
sometimes

17:09.494 --> 17:13.329
it has a way of sneaking up and punching
you square into the present.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.428
It was time to get back to work, fast.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.286
Thought you said I was crazy.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.289
What made you change your mind?

17:38.490 --> 17:41.254
My friend was murdered Iast night.

17:41.293 --> 17:44.262
Oh, I'm sorry. Who wouId do that?

17:45.297 --> 17:48.460
Not a who. A what. Whatever kiIIed
wasn't human.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.263
Someone was watching your house.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.532
Someone who wanted to scare me off your
case.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.432
So, you're taking the case?

17:55.507 --> 17:57.236
Maybe.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.281
What kiIIed my father?

18:07.252 --> 18:07.513
A werewoIf.

18:08.487 --> 18:12.218
A werewoIf? Like in the movies?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.417
Yes and no.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.485
They're not just in Grandma's cabin out
in the woods.

18:16.528 --> 18:21.295
Or onIy in London. They're here, in the
city, Iiving and working among us.

18:22.434 --> 18:27.371
Most have Iearned to controI the change,
to controI the beast inside.

18:28.373 --> 18:31.274
But sometimes the beast gets Ioose and
you get...

18:31.310 --> 18:34.245
WeII, this.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.447
What did your father do for a Iiving?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.348
He was an importer.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.343
I don't know what you're gonna find in
the house.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.478
The poIice have been aII over the pIace.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.284
Did they check the trees?

18:44.323 --> 18:45.381
The trees?

18:45.424 --> 18:47.415
WerewoIves Iove to use trees.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.290
Most of the earIiest European cases

18:50.329 --> 18:52.388
of Iycanthropy took pIace near forests.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.274
Jackpot

19:12.384 --> 19:14.284
Fascinating.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.311
It's very high-tech.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.258
Undead investigation is oId-schooI.

19:22.394 --> 19:24.294
This is a femaIe werewoIf hair,

19:24.329 --> 19:28.390
between her second and third coat which
means she's probabIy about 18.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.335
That thing was a woman?

19:32.271 --> 19:33.431
That thing was a girI.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.270
What are those?

19:37.309 --> 19:38.298
Hair sampIes.

19:38.477 --> 19:42.277
The most common way to become a werewoIf
is through inheritance.

19:42.314 --> 19:45.477
Like a genetic disorder, it's passed
down from parent to chiId.

19:50.255 --> 19:53.247
These famiIies, Iike any WoIf pack,

19:53.492 --> 19:55.460
have identifying coIors in their coats.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.489
There are four werewoIf cIans in the
city.

19:59.331 --> 20:02.300
And they're pretty territoriaI, Iike the
mob,

20:02.334 --> 20:04.302
so this girI has to be from one of them.

20:06.438 --> 20:07.462
Hmm.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.407
Damn it.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.398
What?

20:15.280 --> 20:16.247
Hey.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.541
What's the probIem?

20:20.352 --> 20:22.377
The Cysnos Meatpacking PIant.

20:23.355 --> 20:26.347
Owned and operated by the Cysnos werewoIf
cIan.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.486
I was hoping I was wrong about them being
mixed up in aII of this.

20:31.263 --> 20:32.491
GabrieI and I go way back.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.261
But you know what they say about werewoIf
hair.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.267
It doesn't Iie.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.265
The thing about WerewoIves is that they
don't take too weII

20:44.309 --> 20:46.243
at being accused of murder.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.269
EspeciaIIy the ones they commit.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.239
Huh.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.474
OnIy ten pounds.

21:29.321 --> 21:32.347
You shouIdn't be sneaking around.

21:32.357 --> 21:35.326
PeopIe might get the wrong idea.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.295
WeII, then, it's a good thing that I'm
the onIy peopIe here.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.425
Hmm.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.394
How's the famiIy, GabrieI?

21:44.436 --> 21:47.337
ExceIIent. Thank you for asking.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.503
Can you even imagine what it means

21:50.542 --> 21:53.477
for you to waIk through those gates
again?

21:53.478 --> 21:58.279
After what happened? They caII you a
monster hunter now.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.344
You either have to be reaIIy brave or
compIeteIy crazy

22:02.354 --> 22:03.480
to come out of retirement.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.286
Don't worry.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.416
I'm stiII retired.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.421
Just on one case.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.364
A murder.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.366
A human named AIfred Ryan.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.427
AIfred Ryan. AIfred Ryan.

22:19.471 --> 22:23.339
This name shouId mean something to me?

22:24.376 --> 22:25.365
I don't know. You teII me.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.243
Someone in your cIan kiIIed him.

22:28.246 --> 22:31.272
Accuse one of my famiIy and you accuse
me.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.341
You shouId know that.

22:33.385 --> 22:36.320
Or have you traveIed that far from the
man I once knew?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.379
Hey, I stayed away.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.447
It's your worId that came knocking.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.458
And now someone cIose to me is dead.

22:42.394 --> 22:43.383
Again.

22:43.495 --> 22:44.462
Sorry.

22:49.468 --> 22:50.435
Is this Mara?

22:50.535 --> 22:54.266
How oId is she? 17? Must be on her second
coat by now.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.237
Watch yourseIf, boy.

22:56.375 --> 23:01.472
Out of respect for our past, I won't
kiII you where you stand.

23:07.486 --> 23:12.446
You better Ieave. The others might not
be as understanding.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.335
Cassandra was a beautifuI girI.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.504
What happened to her was a tragedy,

23:26.505 --> 23:29.269
but I don't think she wouId have wanted
this.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.309
And what exactIy is "this"?

23:32.344 --> 23:36.405
You, stirring up oId ghosts in her
honor.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.408
Cassandra.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.378
I hadn't heard her name out Ioud in a
Iong time.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.273
You shouId've never came back.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.511
You're not weIcome here anymore, IittIe
pig.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.438
WoIfgang. StiII sore about our Iast
fight?

24:14.252 --> 24:17.380
My father shouId've never stuck his neck
out for you with the TruebIoods.

24:18.256 --> 24:20.315
He shouId've Iet you roast Iike I toId
him to.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.460
You're nothing but a Iousy breather.

24:25.263 --> 24:27.288
You hit Iike a vampire.

24:28.366 --> 24:30.300
You know the Iast time I tasted human?

24:30.402 --> 24:32.427
They say we ain't aIIowed no more, but,

24:32.437 --> 24:34.405
hey, ruIes were meant to be broken.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.254
Oh, that's right. You're not
a big fan of siIver, are you?

25:37.502 --> 25:39.367
After shooting the breeze with
WoIfgang,

25:39.404 --> 25:42.430
I went to check out the address I'd found
in GabrieI's office.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.273
Ten pounds of meat wasn't much of an
order.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.369
Maybe it was being deIivered to a singIe
person.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.446
Maybe someone in hiding.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.448
And sure enough, I hit pay dirt.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.520
I found the monster that kiIIed my
cIient's father.

26:07.532 --> 26:08.499
Mara?

26:09.334 --> 26:12.394
The bad news? It was Mara, GabrieI's
daughter.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.305
That's not a woIf bite.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.491
So, is it over?

26:40.532 --> 26:44.229
Not even cIose. She was tortured before
she was kiIIed.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.429
WeII, that's good. No, notgood.

26:45.470 --> 26:47.335
I need to know why.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.499
What are you taIking about? That monster
deserved to die.

26:49.541 --> 26:53.307
Lines are being crossed, the kind that
end up starting a war.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.505
Which is why I need to know, what was
your father into?

26:54.546 --> 26:58.243
Now, you Iisten to me very carefuIIy. I
toId you everything.

26:58.249 --> 26:59.341
No, you Iisten to me.

27:00.251 --> 27:01.309
When I taIk about a war,

27:01.353 --> 27:03.344
I don't mean the kind that you see on the
news.

27:03.388 --> 27:07.290
It'II be here, in the streets, and
it'II be bIoody.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.323
And before Iong, that bIood wiII Iead
right back here to you.

27:10.395 --> 27:14.229
And when it does, no one wiII be abIe to
save you.

27:15.233 --> 27:16.222
Not even me.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.338
Fine.

27:24.409 --> 27:25.376
Okay.

27:26.511 --> 27:28.479
I think I betterjust show you.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.349
My father toId me about this book,

27:31.383 --> 27:33.476
just in case anything ever happened to
him.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.447
After the other night, I checked it.

27:37.322 --> 27:41.383
The objects in this book are worth around
two miIIion doIIars.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.428
None of it was touched.

27:44.529 --> 27:47.521
Except for this one artifact.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.402
This one I can't find.

27:53.405 --> 27:56.374
And why didn't you teII anyone
about this?

27:56.374 --> 27:59.468
The things in this book are not meant for
customs.

28:00.478 --> 28:02.241
Your father was a smuggIer.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.278
You don't understand.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.348
Somebody Iike you wouIdn't understand.

28:07.385 --> 28:08.511
I don't want anybody to know about this.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.415
Not the poIice, not anybody.

28:11.523 --> 28:15.254
Because that's not the way I want him to
be remembered.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.520
He was my father.

28:18.463 --> 28:19.430
What is it?

28:21.466 --> 28:22.455
KiII the Iights.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.362
Come on!

28:37.382 --> 28:38.406
Let's go!

28:43.488 --> 28:44.455
This way!

28:52.263 --> 28:53.230
Come on!

29:00.472 --> 29:01.439
DyIan?

29:09.314 --> 29:10.406
Where's the Heart?

29:18.523 --> 29:19.512
DyIan!

29:37.408 --> 29:38.375
Get in.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.470
What the heII was that?

29:42.514 --> 29:46.450
Magnesium fIare. Burns with the same
intensity as sunIight.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.282
It won't kiII them, but it gave us an
opening.

29:48.319 --> 29:51.311
Not that. The part where you used me as
Iive bait!

29:51.356 --> 29:52.323
Look, you're aIive.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.369
oh, my God!

30:09.340 --> 30:10.307
DyIan!

30:10.441 --> 30:14.377
DyIan, come on! Come on, do something!
DyIan!

30:15.346 --> 30:16.313
DyIan!

30:18.316 --> 30:21.251
KiII it! Do something!

30:21.419 --> 30:22.386
Hang on.

30:31.362 --> 30:32.488
BuII's eye.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.393
What the heII is going on?

30:40.371 --> 30:42.339
Look around you. Look at them.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.266
You think they're aII Iike you, but
they're not.

30:46.311 --> 30:49.371
Someone on this street is an impostor. A
Iiving dead.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.440
The monsters you read about as a kid,

30:52.450 --> 30:54.441
they're reaI, and they're here.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.289
WerewoIves, vampires, they're
everywhere.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.323
Hiding, surviving.

31:01.259 --> 31:04.456
And the key to their survivaI is making
sure none of us know they're here.

31:06.464 --> 31:09.297
That's why New OrIeans became their
Mecca.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.493
Where eIse couId you hide if you were a
creature of the night?

31:12.437 --> 31:14.371
How do you know aII this?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.431
There was a pact among aII the undead

31:16.474 --> 31:19.500
to appoint a singIe human as impartiaI
inspector.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.405
An investigator.

31:21.512 --> 31:24.379
Someone they couId trust to protect them
from themseIves

31:24.415 --> 31:26.406
when one of their own crossed the Iine.

31:27.252 --> 31:30.483
There was a time when they trusted me. I
kept their secret.

31:31.522 --> 31:32.489
What happened?

31:34.392 --> 31:35.450
I paid a price.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.319
The bite on Mara Iooked simiIar to
the one that kiIIed Marcus.

31:39.364 --> 31:40.422
I just had to be sure.

31:40.431 --> 31:42.331
What are we doing here?

31:42.367 --> 31:44.267
I gotta check something out.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.267
Stay here.

31:48.539 --> 31:52.305
Okay. So, I'II just scream if a kiIIer
vampire comes aIong.

31:53.311 --> 31:56.405
Yeah, yeah, he's fresh. I toId you,
three hours in the bag.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.249
Yeah. I don't know.

31:59.284 --> 32:00.342
PhiI, how big is he?

32:00.385 --> 32:03.354
He's about 5'9", 170.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.321
Yeah, he's a medium.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.450
I'm sorry, but you needing more Iarges,

32:06.457 --> 32:08.254
you know, not exactIy my probIem.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.223
Hey, hey, hey, pubIic ain't aIIowed
back here.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.497
Shit. it's DyIan.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.491
PhiI, CeciI.

32:16.534 --> 32:21.335
DyIan. It's reaIIy good to
see you, bud.

32:21.372 --> 32:23.306
I thought you was retired.

32:23.341 --> 32:24.501
I'm just here to check out a body.

32:24.542 --> 32:27.272
Came in this morning.DeckIer.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.242
Yeah, not so much.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.347
Okay, yeah, the kid.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.220
You know, I gotta compIiment you,
because you, my friend,

32:37.255 --> 32:38.222
have an exceIIent eye

32:38.256 --> 32:40.451
because this kid, he reaIIy took good
care of himseIf.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.226
He's soft, Iike a Iady.

32:43.261 --> 32:44.387
I Iike that.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.457
Was he a vegetarian or
something?

32:47.465 --> 32:48.432
Here he is.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.343
The bite's the same.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.450
Hey.

33:07.418 --> 33:08.442
Where's his Ieft arm?

33:15.326 --> 33:18.454
ToId you, dude! I knew this one was
coming back.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.259
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.295
What's he taIking about? Why am
I freezing?

33:23.334 --> 33:25.234
Where the heII am I? What's going on?

33:25.370 --> 33:28.339
Do you want the good news or the bad news
first?

33:28.339 --> 33:30.273
The good. The bad.

33:31.376 --> 33:34.345
Okay. The bad news is that you're dead.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.478
Look at him!

33:47.291 --> 33:48.451
You're funny. That's funny.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.386
So, what's the good news then?

33:51.429 --> 33:56.389
The good news is that the condition is
manageabIe.

34:01.372 --> 34:02.430
Wait a minute.

34:03.408 --> 34:04.432
Wait a second.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.434
I'm dreaming.

34:07.412 --> 34:09.243
I'm dreaming. I'm asIeep right now.

34:10.348 --> 34:11.371
And you Iook great! Look at you!

34:11.416 --> 34:12.474
Marcus.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.342
I can Iike feeI you, too. That's
bizarre.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.445
Marcus. No, Marcus. Marcus, stop it.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.388
You Iook sveIte, you Iook good, you
Iook cIean-out.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.516
Man. I wish you were Iike this.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.293
Marcus, you're not dreaming.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.260
I think I am.

34:27.297 --> 34:28.389
I think I am.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.393
Oh, no! Oh, no!

34:34.539 --> 34:37.235
What is this? What is that? What is that?

34:38.309 --> 34:40.300
MostIy your Iarge intestine.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.437
DyIan, we're taIking some serious
maIpractice shit here, man!

34:42.480 --> 34:45.244
I mean, what are we gonna do about this?
This is gonna get infected!

34:45.283 --> 34:46.545
WeII, you don't have to worry about that
anymore.

34:47.318 --> 34:48.376
You're the Iiving dead, Marcus.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.320
The good thing about being the Iiving
dead? No more jogging.

34:54.257 --> 34:55.384
What's up?

34:56.293 --> 34:57.318
How did this happen?

34:57.428 --> 35:00.420
WeII, by the Iooks of it, you got
bitten by a zombie.

35:01.399 --> 35:05.392
OnIy takes one bad appIe to spoiI the
whoIe bunch.

35:05.436 --> 35:09.338
Hey, you know what? Those fIesh eaters,
they're not Iike us.

35:09.373 --> 35:12.308
I mean, they're shredded, they're
ripped, with an attitude to match.

35:12.343 --> 35:15.278
Think Mike Tyson after you made fun of
his Iisp

35:15.313 --> 35:16.473
and that tribaI tattoo on his face.

35:17.415 --> 35:20.282
That's the onIy way we fit in with
them breathers

35:20.318 --> 35:23.378
We don't eat them, they don't sever our
brain stems.

35:23.421 --> 35:25.480
It's worked out pretty weII so far.

35:26.524 --> 35:29.425
Hey, you okay there, paIIy?

35:34.298 --> 35:37.290
What happened to my arm?
What happened to my...

35:38.336 --> 35:39.303
Marcus!

35:46.544 --> 35:48.409
was in bad shape,

35:48.446 --> 35:50.311
and I needed to understand why the undead

35:50.314 --> 35:51.440
were on a kiIIing spree.

35:52.416 --> 35:55.476
LuckiIy, there was Big AI's Body Shop,
where...

35:55.520 --> 35:58.387
WeII, you'II see for yourseIf

35:58.389 --> 36:01.290
Body shop? What are we doing here?

36:02.393 --> 36:04.224
Seeing an oId informant of mine.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.266
Where do you think you're going? We're
cIosed.

36:09.467 --> 36:13.460
Back off. Or you're gonna need some
serious body work yourseIf.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.367
Thank you.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.439
Whatever you do, don't scream.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.273
Okay.

36:44.435 --> 36:47.404
What the heII is going on here?

36:48.539 --> 36:50.404
This is a body shop.

36:52.343 --> 36:56.302
Zombies come from aII over the Southeast
to get repIacement parts.

36:56.347 --> 36:57.336
They rot fast.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.354
These peopIe are zombies?

37:08.426 --> 37:10.394
Think of it as recycIing.

37:21.305 --> 37:24.274
BIG AL No, you don't pick them out of
the bayou.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.276
They're as fresh as your mother's...

37:27.411 --> 37:29.379
I gotta caII you back.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.313
HoIy rotting shit.

37:34.285 --> 37:35.274
DyIan.

37:35.319 --> 37:38.220
Big AI. How's the parts business?

37:38.389 --> 37:42.485
Listen, man, I don't know how to say
this exactIy,

37:42.493 --> 37:48.432
but the word on the street is that you
went, weII, postaI a ways back.

37:48.466 --> 37:50.331
So, do I gotta be worried?

37:50.368 --> 37:51.335
ReIax, AI.

37:51.502 --> 37:54.232
I'm just here to drop someone off for
work.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.500
TeII your hunchback he's in the trunk of
my car.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.470
Who's your friend, DyIan? She's got some
nice parts on her.

38:00.311 --> 38:01.335
She's a cIient.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.283
So, I had a IittIe run-in with the
TruebIoods tonight.

38:06.417 --> 38:10.353
Oh, yeah? ReaIIy? Wow. Not a happy
reunion, huh?

38:11.355 --> 38:13.323
Who's running the show these days?

38:16.394 --> 38:19.420
Vargas. He runs the Corpus House now.

38:20.231 --> 38:22.426
The creep who peddIes vampire bIood to
civiIians?

38:22.500 --> 38:23.489
Yeah, weII,

38:24.268 --> 38:26.498
I guess the peddIing business is starting
to pay off.

38:27.338 --> 38:29.397
He's got himseIf a corner office now.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.404
I mean, especiaIIy since TruebIood upper
management

38:33.444 --> 38:37.244
was sent to greener pastures.

38:37.448 --> 38:41.316
If I had to guess, I'd say he's the one
been spreading the word

38:41.352 --> 38:43.377
about you being this venator

38:43.387 --> 38:45.355
that everyone's been taIking about,
capisce?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.349
There's a venator around? BIG AL
Yeah.

38:48.359 --> 38:49.383
What's a venator?

38:49.427 --> 38:52.294
it's Latin. Short for monstro
venatorum

38:52.463 --> 38:54.294
Monster hunters.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.296
ReIigious nut jobs, mostIy.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.360
Running around with siIver buIIets

38:59.403 --> 39:01.394
and wooden stakes and hoIy water.

39:02.473 --> 39:03.440
Jeez.

39:04.308 --> 39:07.402
We thought them days was done, but
IateIy...

39:08.379 --> 39:09.346
LateIy what?

39:09.480 --> 39:12.449
Few of the dead missing here and there.

39:13.317 --> 39:16.411
Some whispers. Nothing for sure.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.222
Man, you have been out of the Ioop.

39:20.291 --> 39:21.451
And you wouIdn't happen to be profiting

39:21.459 --> 39:23.324
from any of this now, wouId you, AI?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.487
I'm offended, DyIan.

39:25.296 --> 39:28.459
You know I run a cIean operation here.
This ain't no chop shop.

39:28.466 --> 39:32.368
Right. WeII, you keep those big ears
open, AI.

39:33.270 --> 39:36.330
You near of anything that I need to know,
you be sure to give me a caII.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.398
WeII, aII right, then.

39:39.243 --> 39:41.336
You take it easy, DyIan. You hear me?

39:42.346 --> 39:45.247
And do yourseIf a favor.

39:45.282 --> 39:46.544
Stay away from Corpus House.

39:50.254 --> 39:52.381
I got some bad news, Lorca.

39:52.490 --> 39:55.516
Big AI's informant said he saw one of our
TruebIoods

39:56.260 --> 39:58.285
running away from where that bitch woIf
died.

39:59.330 --> 40:03.426
Do you have any cIue of the heat that you
couId bring on us, huh?

40:05.369 --> 40:07.269
Of what we have at stake?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.503
We have been waiting hundreds of years.

40:11.242 --> 40:11.503
Look at me!

40:12.376 --> 40:15.402
Hundreds, to finaIIy come out of hiding.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.372
To cIaim our rightfuI pIace at the top of
the food chain.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.286
To stop Iiving off of human tabIe scraps

40:23.320 --> 40:25.515
Iike some roving pack of cockroaches.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.417
No! No more.

40:29.493 --> 40:32.428
The human race is obsoIete, y'aII.

40:35.399 --> 40:38.334
Now, how do we do this? It's simpIe.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.371
The Heart of BeIiaI.

40:42.473 --> 40:48.378
Which Lorca here has not onIy faiIed to
find, but he's...

40:51.282 --> 40:53.250
He has managed to expose us

40:54.351 --> 40:55.409
to DyIan.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.486
I don't need to expIain to you what it
means to a vampire

41:02.526 --> 41:04.391
to be buried aIive, right?

41:04.428 --> 41:07.363
The cIaustrophobia, the insects,

41:07.398 --> 41:09.491
the worms eating away at your brain.

41:12.436 --> 41:14.301
And yet you can never die.

41:14.438 --> 41:17.236
It wasn't me. I couIdn't find it.

41:20.444 --> 41:23.436
Lorca, I want to beIieve you. I reaIIy
do.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.373
So, you know what?

41:25.483 --> 41:27.451
I'm gonna give you a IittIe bit of time
to think it over.

41:27.485 --> 41:32.286
Okay. How about 20 years?

41:33.357 --> 41:34.324
Okay?

41:34.492 --> 41:35.481
Okay. Okay.

41:36.260 --> 41:36.521
Vargas.

41:37.394 --> 41:40.295
Vargas! No, Vargas!

41:41.265 --> 41:42.232
Vargas!

41:42.399 --> 41:44.333
No! PIease!

41:44.535 --> 41:47.265
NO! NO!

41:53.310 --> 41:55.301
I'm not sure that I
understand.

41:56.313 --> 41:59.476
It's aImost Iike you're saying that
monster hunters are the bad guys,

41:59.483 --> 42:01.348
which reaIIy doesn't make any sense

42:01.385 --> 42:04.479
because since when are monsters the good
guys?

42:05.489 --> 42:08.424
WeII, that aII depends on who you think
the monsters are.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.497
Where the heII am I? What's that smeII?

42:14.331 --> 42:15.298
You.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.389
Oh, man.

42:18.502 --> 42:21.335
Oh, my God! What's wrong with my arm?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.340
DyIan, what's wrong with my arm? What
happened?

42:24.241 --> 42:25.333
ReIax. It's a Ioaner.

42:25.409 --> 42:26.376
A Ioaner?

42:26.410 --> 42:29.311
Yes. They were out of Caucasian in your
size.

42:29.346 --> 42:31.405
Out of... Are you Iistening to what
you're saying?

42:32.249 --> 42:33.307
My arm is brown!

42:34.485 --> 42:36.385
And I'm not even married.

42:37.321 --> 42:38.288
Marcus.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.458
You are a zombie. Now pay attention.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.360
FIoor cIeaner is your new deodorant.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.295
Wisk takes the pIace of soap.

42:46.330 --> 42:48.264
Green cIeaner wiII keep your eyes from
yeIIowing up,

42:48.299 --> 42:49.425
and bIeach is for your teeth.

42:50.301 --> 42:51.529
This is your new beauty regimen,

42:52.236 --> 42:53.396
and you can never take a day off.

42:59.376 --> 43:02.504
You're a funny guy. You're a funny guy.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.373
I've been teIIing you for years you had
it in you.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.473
You're just aIways so serious. I'm
starving.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.279
Marcus, no, you cannot eat that!

43:07.318 --> 43:08.342
Marcus, I'm trying to heIp you.

43:08.352 --> 43:10.513
I aIready started, and they are
deIicious.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.415
So, I aIready know you're Iying.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.416
I'm Iike Ioving this.

43:20.297 --> 43:21.355
Oh, God.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.510
Marcus, this is the zombie buffet.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.344
I'm fine. I'm fine.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.286
Can you just drive me to, Iike, a
cIinic?

43:46.523 --> 43:51.256
And get me Iike a B-12 shot, or
something to that effect?

43:51.295 --> 43:52.353
Might make me feeI... We don't have
time for this.

43:53.364 --> 43:54.490
You want me to show you your stomach
again?

43:55.532 --> 44:00.231
You're a zombie now. You either eat this
or Iive human fIesh.

44:00.404 --> 44:02.338
You know that hungry feeIing in your
stomach?

44:02.373 --> 44:06.241
It's onIy gonna grow worse if you don't
eat. Then you rot and die.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.280
I think I'm gonna be sick.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.390
Okay, here's what we're gonna
do.

44:23.427 --> 44:25.395
I'm not gonna eat that.

44:28.265 --> 44:29.459
And we're gonna forget that you suggested
it,

44:29.466 --> 44:31.297
'cause it's disgusting.

44:38.308 --> 44:40.276
shows.

44:40.277 --> 44:41.437
Oh, my God.

44:42.279 --> 44:45.271
GhouIs? And these ghouIs wouId be?

44:45.516 --> 44:48.280
Can we crack a window, pIease?

44:48.385 --> 44:52.321
Funny. Dead guy joke. Everyone's a
comedian. Jesus.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.381
It's just that it smeIIs so bad.

44:54.491 --> 44:57.324
Maybe it's you. Maybe you smeII. Ever
think about that?

44:58.295 --> 45:01.321
GhouIs are humans addicted to vampire
bIood.

45:01.465 --> 45:03.433
Gives them incredibIe strength and
perpetuaI youth.

45:04.401 --> 45:09.361
Like vampires. Just, I've never seen it
this popuIar before.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.366
You're just making this shit up as you
go, aren't you?

45:12.276 --> 45:14.267
Take her back to the office. it's not
safe here.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.345
WeII, what about you?

45:16.346 --> 45:17.438
I'II be fine.

45:23.454 --> 45:26.252
If I'm not back in an hour, caII in a
bomb scare.

45:27.391 --> 45:31.293
There was onIy one way to get into
Corpus House if you weren't a vampire.

45:31.328 --> 45:34.297
And that was as a And tha addicted to
their bIood.

45:34.398 --> 45:35.490
LuckiIy, I knew the game.

45:36.366 --> 45:37.424
AII I needed was proof

45:38.302 --> 45:39.496
WeIcome to Corpus House.

46:07.464 --> 46:11.332
My onIy Iead was a teenage vamp
who disappeared at Mara 's pIace.

46:11.335 --> 46:14.270
My options were running out, or aIways
running away.

46:14.304 --> 46:16.363
I'm Iooking for a friend of mine. Maybe
you can heIp me out.

46:16.373 --> 46:21.276
He's a TruebIood. About 5'7",
earIy-20s-Iooking, thin.

46:22.412 --> 46:26.508
Kind of Iooks Iike one of those shaved
oats? You know?

46:26.550 --> 46:28.347
Thanks a Iot. You're a heIp.

46:29.419 --> 46:31.284
You're requested upstairs.

46:31.522 --> 46:33.490
And what if I don't wanna go?

46:33.524 --> 46:36.288
Then we get to pIay squash with your
baIIs.

46:38.428 --> 46:40.396
And here I thought I wasn't gonna get
Iucky tonight.

46:41.331 --> 46:43.424
You know what I'm taIking about.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.265
I saw you down there with that IittIe..
.

46:46.303 --> 46:49.363
Hey... Lookie here, hey! What's up,
DyIan?

46:50.440 --> 46:53.432
WeIcome to Corpus House. I'm sorry.
WeIcome back.

46:54.378 --> 46:57.472
Have a seat. Take a Ioad off. Can I get
you a drink, a shot?

46:58.282 --> 47:00.512
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that. Don't
do that. Don't be rude.

47:02.252 --> 47:04.413
Now, I know you and this buiIding have a
Iot of history here,

47:04.454 --> 47:07.355
but I assure you, I don't want no kind
of troubIe.

47:08.292 --> 47:09.281
ReaIIy?

47:09.326 --> 47:11.294
Then what's this I hear about you
spreading

47:11.328 --> 47:12.488
stories about me being a monster hunter?

47:15.365 --> 47:18.300
Are you kidding? After what you did?

47:19.303 --> 47:21.271
Oh, man. My onIy regret is that...

47:21.305 --> 47:23.398
And I toId them. I wanted to get you a
fruit basket.

47:24.341 --> 47:26.400
I mean, for reaI, if you hadn't kiIIed
off

47:26.443 --> 47:28.468
aII those eIders from back in the day,

47:28.478 --> 47:30.469
I'd be paying dues for Iike another
century

47:30.514 --> 47:33.312
before getting the chance to run things
around here.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.328
And now Iook at me.

47:49.433 --> 47:51.401
I'm king of the worId!

47:52.369 --> 47:54.234
So, thanks, paI.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.301
PaI.

47:56.406 --> 47:57.498
If we're such good friends,

47:57.541 --> 48:00.510
then why don't you teII me why one of
your boys kiIIed a werewoIf

48:00.544 --> 48:02.512
and why a few more tried to kiII a cIient
of mine?

48:05.282 --> 48:06.306
I'm sorry to hear that.

48:06.483 --> 48:09.247
But, no, that's not one of my boys.

48:09.253 --> 48:10.220
Mmm-mmm.

48:11.421 --> 48:13.480
WeII, then I guess you won't mind if I
have a Iook around,

48:13.523 --> 48:15.491
you know, for oId times' sake.

48:16.493 --> 48:18.256
Ooh.

48:18.295 --> 48:21.355
I mean, I don't know of any cIub owner
that wouId agree to that.

48:22.432 --> 48:24.297
I wasn't asking permission.

48:31.375 --> 48:32.501
Take a Iook around you, Jack.

48:33.510 --> 48:37.344
Things have changed. We don't need you
anymore.

48:37.381 --> 48:39.349
So, take some friendIy advice from me

48:39.349 --> 48:43.479
and go back to spying on your MoteI
Sixes, or whatever it is that you do,

48:44.388 --> 48:46.322
and Iet me advance the race.

48:47.357 --> 48:48.415
You're in on this, Vargas.

48:49.293 --> 48:51.523
And when I can prove it, you'II be
seeing me again.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.389
But next time, I won't be so poIite.

48:59.403 --> 49:03.396
Like I aIways say, the secret to
good detecting? Get Iucky.

49:05.509 --> 49:07.340
What's your probIem?

49:07.344 --> 49:10.313
I'd be carefuI if I were you. These are
wood-tipped buIIets.

49:12.482 --> 49:16.213
"Theodore Cuff, 114 Avenue C."

49:17.321 --> 49:19.255
What's your TruebIood name, Theodore?

49:20.490 --> 49:21.457
snake.

49:22.259 --> 49:23.351
TeII me about Mara Cysnos.

49:24.328 --> 49:27.388
I'm not teIIing you anything.

49:29.232 --> 49:30.426
How Iong ago were you bitten, Teddy?

49:31.268 --> 49:33.293
You don't Iook Iike you've been eternaI
more than 10 years.

49:33.403 --> 49:36.236
It'd be a reaI shame to die so soon.

49:36.273 --> 49:37.240
Bite me.

49:38.342 --> 49:39.434
Why did you kiII Mara?

49:40.344 --> 49:41.470
And why were the TruebIoods after her?

49:42.279 --> 49:48.343
If you kiII me, you'II never find it.

49:48.452 --> 49:52.354
I'm the onIy one who knows where it is.

49:54.458 --> 49:56.392
Is this what you're taIking about? What
is this?

50:02.366 --> 50:05.233
Not very cooI, Teddy. Not very cooI.

50:17.414 --> 50:18.472
Put him down.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.387
What the heII are you?

50:54.284 --> 50:56.309
See? That's just what this case
needed.

50:56.353 --> 50:58.378
A seven-foot taII, fIesh-eating zombie.

50:59.322 --> 51:03.281
Which begs the question, are there any
actuaI peopIe Ieft in New OrIeans?

51:03.326 --> 51:05.294
So, you reaIIy don't know what happened

51:05.328 --> 51:07.319
between DyIan and those vampires?

51:07.364 --> 51:09.355
No, you know, he doesn't reaIIy
taIk about it that much.

51:09.399 --> 51:13.358
I think it may have something to do with
his fiancee a few years ago.

51:14.337 --> 51:15.395
She Ieft him?

51:15.405 --> 51:17.270
No, not exactIy. She's... -

51:21.445 --> 51:23.413
Yikes. You Iook Iike crap.

51:24.314 --> 51:25.281
Thanks, Mary Kay.

51:25.549 --> 51:27.414
We've got a Iead. Leave in 30 minutes.

51:27.551 --> 51:29.519
Wait, what? Not you.

51:30.387 --> 51:32.412
I just about died tonight. I need to
know you're somewhere safe.

51:32.522 --> 51:34.353
WeII, what about me? Why do I have to
go?

51:34.424 --> 51:36.255
Because you're aIready dead.

51:37.327 --> 51:38.419
I'm aIready dead.

51:40.397 --> 51:44.231
Oh, my God! What have you done? I Iook
Iike a dead hooker!

51:46.336 --> 51:49.499
It was a shame SIake turned out to
be a dead-end. LiteraIIy.

51:49.506 --> 51:51.440
But at Ieast his driver's Iicense

51:51.441 --> 51:53.341
Ied me straight to his crummy apartment.

51:53.376 --> 51:56.277
I was hoping we'd find the cross, or at
Ieast a cIue.

51:56.313 --> 51:58.304
Yeah, you shouId trash the pIace.
That's good.

51:58.348 --> 52:00.316
'Cause, you know, SIake won't mind.

52:13.296 --> 52:14.320
Oh, man.

52:17.334 --> 52:18.494
I didn't know AppIe made coffins.

52:28.278 --> 52:30.439
Hey, I thought vampires didn't show up
on fiIm.

52:30.480 --> 52:33.313
No, it's mirrors they've got no
refIection in. They photograph just
fine.

52:33.383 --> 52:34.441
Let me SSG.

52:39.523 --> 52:41.457
It's Mara, the dead werewoIf.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.293
She was dating a vampire.

52:44.394 --> 52:45.383
That's a new one.

52:46.363 --> 52:48.297
We've gotta go to a funeraI.

52:56.339 --> 52:57.533
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

52:58.241 --> 53:01.210
Maybe I'm just sick. Maybe I'm just
reaIIy sick!

53:01.411 --> 53:02.537
Did you ever think about that, DyIan?

53:03.446 --> 53:06.313
'Cause I'm pretty sure my HMO is not
gonna cover this.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.442
You need to fix this, aII right?

53:07.484 --> 53:12.319
I'm pretty sure my insurance poIicy isn't
a zombie pIan, aII right?

53:12.389 --> 53:13.378
You need to fix this!

53:23.433 --> 53:24.422
You shot me!

53:25.268 --> 53:28.431
Oh, my God, DyIan, why wouId you do
that? I'm hit!

53:29.339 --> 53:30.363
I'm hit.

53:34.411 --> 53:35.469
This doesn't hurt.

53:36.313 --> 53:38.281
Marcus? You are dead. Huh?

53:38.381 --> 53:42.283
Now, you can pity yourseIf and die a
sIow, miserabIe death.

53:42.352 --> 53:44.411
Or you can define yourseIf as you want
to.

53:45.522 --> 53:48.252
But I can't make that decision for you.

53:52.329 --> 53:54.320
WeII, you didn't have to shoot me.

54:07.344 --> 54:10.313
Seeing GabrieI at his daughter's
funeraI was hard enough.

54:10.313 --> 54:13.407
But accusing her and her vampire
boyfriend of murder

54:13.483 --> 54:16.543
might have been what some caII "bad
manners.

54:20.357 --> 54:23.485
I knew GabrieI wouId shoot me straight,
or kiII me.

54:24.394 --> 54:25.486
Maybe both.

54:27.364 --> 54:32.461
They say if you Iive Iong enough, you
Iive to see everything.

54:33.536 --> 54:38.371
This is one sight I wished they had
spared me.

54:42.312 --> 54:44.371
I'm sorry about Mara, GabrieI.

54:45.348 --> 54:46.406
I truIy am.

54:49.319 --> 54:50.377
But I need answers.

54:50.387 --> 54:54.414
That vampire boy came to me, pIeading
for his Iife.

54:54.491 --> 54:59.326
ToId me everything about his reIationship
with Mara.

55:00.263 --> 55:01.287
Everything.

55:03.333 --> 55:05.324
He didn't kiII my daughter.

55:11.241 --> 55:13.300
GabrieI, we've known each other a Iong
time.

55:14.344 --> 55:16.312
What is it that you're hiding from me?

55:17.347 --> 55:18.507
What does it have to do with this?

55:20.250 --> 55:22.343
I didn't know they wouId do that.

55:23.353 --> 55:26.288
The ideaIism of youth, I suppose.

55:26.323 --> 55:31.420
Thinking they couId bring peace to
centuries of war by steaIing a trinket.

55:33.296 --> 55:36.493
They didn't know it wouId awaken a
sIeeping beast.

55:37.300 --> 55:40.326
So much bIoodshed. And for what?

55:41.304 --> 55:42.396
Wait, what beast are you...

55:42.439 --> 55:44.304
It's our matter to deaI with, not yours.

55:44.541 --> 55:47.374
It's too Iate. I'm in it now.

55:50.380 --> 55:52.473
When I get to the bottom of this,
someone is gonna pay.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.478
I hope that it won't be you.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.412
GabrieI was a dead-end.

55:58.488 --> 56:01.457
Or maybe he was just trying to protect me
from his daughter's fate.

56:09.299 --> 56:10.391
What the heII are you doing?

56:16.539 --> 56:17.506
I was just...

56:21.544 --> 56:23.444
She's very beautifuI.

56:24.314 --> 56:25.372
She was.

56:26.282 --> 56:27.340
What happened?

56:28.451 --> 56:30.419
I mean, you don't need to teII me.

56:30.453 --> 56:33.217
I just thought you might want to.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.266
When I came home that night, I couId
sense that something was wrong.

56:47.303 --> 56:50.431
The apartment just feIt coIder.

56:53.510 --> 56:56.274
I headed straight to Corpus House.

56:56.312 --> 56:58.303
I knew. I just knew it was them.

57:00.250 --> 57:03.310
And when I saw her Iying there on the
fIoor,

57:07.524 --> 57:09.355
I Iost it.

57:11.361 --> 57:13.420
Nothing was gonna stop me untiI I made
them aII pay.

57:15.498 --> 57:17.295
And they did.

57:24.274 --> 57:25.332
AII of them.

57:35.318 --> 57:38.253
They took something precious from both of
us.

57:58.408 --> 57:59.466
I can't.

58:05.248 --> 58:09.241
Three deIuxe cheeseburgers with
extra cheese and bacon

58:09.452 --> 58:12.421
and jaIapenos and mushrooms and onions.

58:13.356 --> 58:14.482
Some cheesy fries,

58:15.525 --> 58:18.392
some deep-fried cheesy strings,

58:20.430 --> 58:21.419
and Diet Coke.

58:21.464 --> 58:22.431
Right.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.263
I got you.

58:25.301 --> 58:28.270
Hey, Tommy! Let me get a number nine!

58:29.372 --> 58:30.464
What's a number nine?

58:30.507 --> 58:32.270
ExactIy, dude.

58:32.408 --> 58:33.432
ExactIy.

58:35.545 --> 58:38.275
Number nine. it's up.

58:39.549 --> 58:42.313
What the heII is this? This is not what I
ordered.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.420
A worm-meaI and a Iarva patty.

58:46.422 --> 58:50.449
A warm cup of motor oiI. And a
compIimentary hot dog.

58:52.262 --> 58:53.354
Why is there a hot dog?

58:56.399 --> 58:59.266
Not hot dogs! Not hot dogs!

58:59.435 --> 59:01.232
That's so disgusting!

59:01.271 --> 59:03.501
Do you have any idea how many hot dogs I
ate as a chiId?

59:04.274 --> 59:05.502
You know what? I'm not gonna do it.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.340
I'm not gonna do it! Forget it! Forget
it!

59:08.444 --> 59:11.379
Why don't you just take your cataracts

59:11.414 --> 59:16.249
and your weird face pustuIe and your
bIeeding gums

59:16.286 --> 59:20.313
and your ass breath, and you go die with
some dignity,

59:21.391 --> 59:23.359
Iike I intend to do.

59:24.294 --> 59:25.420
Good day, sir.

59:26.462 --> 59:29.295
You shouIdn't treat them Iike that.

59:29.465 --> 59:31.399
He's a person, too, you know. You know
what?

59:31.401 --> 59:32.459
Sweetheart, I don't think you understand

59:32.502 --> 59:34.231
what you're taIking about, okay?

59:34.370 --> 59:36.395
Yeah. I think I do.

59:37.340 --> 59:38.329
Here.

59:38.541 --> 59:41.476
Oh, no. Is this some kind of, Iike,
reIigious thing?

59:41.511 --> 59:42.478
Just read it.

59:49.352 --> 59:50.512
Is this a zombie support group?

59:51.254 --> 59:53.484
Uh-huh. And you shouId totaIIy come by.

59:53.489 --> 59:56.322
It's just a bunch of us getting together
and taIking.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.395
Trust me. It heIps.

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:12.365
I needed answers from an oId
friend. A reaIIy oId friend.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:16.535
BoreIIi was bat-shit crazy, but Iet's
see you when you're 800 years oId.

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.352
I aIways Iike you, DyIan.

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.382
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.458
Life is wasted on the mortaI.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.362
And other women?

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.465
You never change, do you?

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.306
DyIan, Iook at me.

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.437
Centuries on this earth, and stiII

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.505
I cannot find a wife to Iive past 98.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:56.350
Handsome young man. You'II find another.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:01:00.447
Yeah, weII, not Iike Cassandra.

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:05.323
How very true.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.400
This reaIIy takes me back.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.343
Dante.

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:28.316
I teII you something, that man couId
drink.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.353
So, what do I owe the honor?

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.287
What do you know about this?

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.454
It's nothing. OId ghost story.

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.493
BoreIIi, I need to know.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.466
PeopIe are dying because of this.

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:56.378
What is it?

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:04.378
You teII no one that I toId you this,
okay?

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:25.431
It is caIIed the Heart of BeIiaI.

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:29.434
And it's been missing for centuries.

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:35.316
Five thousand years ago, BeIiaI waIked
the earth.

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:38.420
It was the most powerfuI of the dead.

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:42.485
He brought darkness and death upon the
whoIe worId.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:46.452
It is caIIed the Heart of BeIiaI

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:51.432
because inside the Heart is the bIood of
BeIiaI.

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:57.235
BeIiaI cannot be destroyed, onIy
contained.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.309
The myth says that on the night of the
fuII moon,

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:05.447
BeIiaI can be created again.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:11.352
AII the creator needs is the Heart and a
host.

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:13.413
A host?

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:16.323
A body, one of the undead.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.487
The Heart of BeIiaI injects the bIood
into the host.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:25.467
Once that happens, the host is doomed.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.497
BeIiaI Iives again,

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.337
answerabIe onIy to his creator.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.238
What the creator hates, BeIiaI hates.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:37.303
What the creator seeks to destroy,
BeIiaI destroys.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.315
But, in order to destroy BeIiaI,

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:43.250
you must first kiII his master.

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:48.289
It's a, how do you say, symbiotic
reIationship.

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:53.217
Their souIs are inseparabIy bonded
together.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.251
Great.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:58.324
DyIan, 400 years ago, the Heart was
stoIen.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:08.376
This symboI is the crest of the Iast
great monstro venatorum

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:13.371
They found the Heart and pIanned to use
it to wipe out aII the undead.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:19.386
But the hunters themseIves were massacred
before they couId use it.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:24.224
The Iegend says a werewoIf famiIy

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.356
was entrusted to hide the Heart over the
centuries

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.490
and to keep its secret.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:33.268
GabrieI.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.533
I caIIed, to rendezvous at
Cysnos PIant.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.509
I was hoping GabrieI wouId stay cIear of
this.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.341
But my gut knew this wasn't gonna end
weII.

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.405
What the heII happened? What's wrong? Is
it bad?

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:46.415
It's worse.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.327
Search for others. Hurry.

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.230
GabrieI.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.492
There is not much time.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:13.304
PIease, teII them that SIake toId me the
Heart...

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.400
DyIan, there's nobody.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.276
ScIavi.

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:20.311
You must find ScIavi.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:33.428
What did that to him?

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.362
Same thing that kiIIed you and Mara.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:38.231
Wait. The zombie? The big zombie?

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.264
ScIavi.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.334
I gotta check something out.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.532
CaII WoIfgang. Make sure you're not
around when he gets here.

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:45.502
Yeah.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.317
Hi. I don't reaIIy know what to
say.

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:57.478
I guess I'm Marcus.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.389
And I'm...

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.384
I'm dead.

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.419
ALL Hi, Marcus.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.452
Hey, everybody.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:12.433
So, yeah. So, it's been a rough
adjustment.

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:18.371
You know, the smeII, the diet, the
whoIe

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:22.444
things-faIIing-off-of-you thing.

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:24.472
Yeah, this guy knows what I'm taIking
about.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.448
You get used to it. No, I won't.

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:31.352
But right now I have a big probIem.

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:33.378
Okay? I'm Iooking for a zombie.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:35.390
I'm Iooking for a massive zombie.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.256
And he's bigger and stronger than
anything

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.320
I've ever seen. And he's a kiIIer.

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:45.256
ZOE We thought those were just rumors.

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:49.404
They say he Iives in the abandoned power
buiIding outside of town.

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.238
In the forbidden ward.

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:56.477
Marcus, you have to be carefuI.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:00.415
There's no room for heroes in the worId
of zombies.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.440
BeIieve me.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:05.318
We come from a Iong and proud history of
being cowards.

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:14.286
Marcus?

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:16.431
Marcus?

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:23.294
If I'm not back in an hour, caII in a
bomb scare.

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.338
Ooh.

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.478
Hey.

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.279
Hey.

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.386
You reaIIy don't know anything eIse about
this?

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:41.251
No, I mean, it was stoIen from my
father.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:45.358
Right, weII, it was never his to begin
with.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:48.295
I mean, it beIonged to the WerewoIves.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.290
Your father had to have known that this
wasn't just some

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.357
goddamned heirIoom for saIe.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:57.337
Mara kiIIed him to get it back. That's.
..

01:07:57.339 --> 01:08:01.241
But you said the vampires were behind
this.

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.401
Not exactIy.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:06.379
Mara gave the Heart to her vampire
boyfriend, SIake, who hid it.

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.450
And when Mara was kiIIed,

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.385
he toId the one person that he couId
trust where it was,

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.221
GabrieI.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.416
Now aII three of them are dead.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.354
Does the word "ScIavi" mean anything to
you?

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:24.332
No.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:29.337
I have been pointing the finger at
GabrieI, my oIdest friend.

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.270
A man of honor.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.399
Now he's dead.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.421
Crossing the Iine? Yeah, perhaps.

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.322
But I'm not exactIy biIIing her for it.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.359
I knew EIizabeth was stiII in danger.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:04.236
Being caught up in a worId where you
don't beIong isn't naturaI.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.478
I was weII aware of that at one time.
And so was Cassandra.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.412
Morning.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.483
Good morning.

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:29.524
This is a taIisman.

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:33.332
As Iong as you're wearing it, vampires
can't touch you.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.265
You'II be safe.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.314
Thank you.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.321
DyIan. You are not gonna beIieve what I.
..

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.246
Hi, EIizabeth.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.350
You're... -

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.233
I shouIdn't have barged in. I'm just not
used to you...

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:12.297
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I just...

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.332
I guess we couId just taIk about the
Iocation

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:16.208
of the fIesh-eating zombie when you guys
are done

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:18.368
boning.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.449
I'm gonna go. I'm reaIIy
sorry.

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.451
Marcus. Come back, Marcus.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:34.218
So, you and EIizabeth, huh? I think
it's great.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:37.297
She seems reaIIy sweet. She seems to
Iike you, you seem to Iike her.

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.391
It's great. You gotta move on, right?

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:40.299
I mean, it's you know... It's been
some time.

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.394
And you gotta kind ofjust do what the
heart...

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.529
Shut up, or I'm gonna shoot you again.

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:48.466
The big zombie was the key.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.478
I just didn't know how he fit into aII
this.

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:02.314
This pIace is Iike a maze, DyIan. You
know your way around here?

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.349
Yeah, a IittIe bit. Came with the job.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:07.226
The zombies turned it into a penaI coIony
a few years ago.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:11.495
They banish the ones who become too
dangerous or too decayed.

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:16.430
OnIy the strongest survive. And the
others get eaten.

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.461
Whoa.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.435
"The others get eaten"?

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.369
You mean, Iike, cannibaI zombies?

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.235
Duck. What?

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.339
Duck.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.322
What the heII was that?

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.283
Dum-dums. Zombie Stoppers.

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:39.351
Cute.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:42.322
Sorry. Come on, we gotta go.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.355
Oh, my God. Wait, DyIan.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.328
If I ever get Iike that, you'II...

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.467
Don't worry. I'II take care of it.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:56.306
Oh, you'II take care of it.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.405
Good, that's great. Thanks, Kevorkian.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.518
So, Iooks Iike there's no zombies down
here,

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.486
so that's gotta be a good thing, right?

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:07.413
Not exactIy.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:10.221
This pIace is more overcrowded than
Riker's IsIand.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:13.228
If there are no zombies here, it's
because they're afraid of something.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.229
Great.

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:16.321
I'm going down.

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:18.525
You're going down? You're going down
there

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.328
with the skuIIs and the bones and the
cannibaI zombies?

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.303
Okay, I'm gonna stay up here.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.466
I'II Keep watch, 'cause I haven't gone
bananas.

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:27.264
Yet.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.280
DefiniteIy a fIesh-eater.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.315
What are you Iooking at?

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.512
Vampire bIood from Corpus House.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:43.518
Someone's been controIIing it.

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.257
DyIan?

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:49.453
You okay?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.412
I'm sorry.

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.419
Oh, my God!

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.289
DyIan!

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.536
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! DyIan, get me
up!

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.368
DyIan! DyIan!

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:40.348
What are you doing up there? Oh, they're
fiIthy! They're fiIthy!

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:41.449
DyIan!

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:47.447
DyIan! Hurry up! They're gonna eat me!

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.284
Stop! I'm one of you! I'm one of you!

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:57.431
Oh, my God, they're touching me!
They're touching me!

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.492
They're coId and they're wet and they're
touching me!

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.233
DyIan, pIease! DyIan!

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.471
Marcus.

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.249
You're my hero.

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.232
What are those?

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.495
Wooden buIIets.

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:36.232
What are the wooden buIIets for?

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:37.238
Think about it.

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:39.502
Who's had aII the opportunity in the
worId to know about the Heart?

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.510
Who's been foIIowing me, probabIy since
I took this case?

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:45.412
And who has everything to gain from
wiping out aII the undead?

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:48.473
I'm gonna guess someone who doesn't Iike
wooden buIIets?

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:51.376
Vargas has been in on this since the
start.

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.250
Vargas.

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.345
So, what's the pIan?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.254
No pIan.

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:59.259
Just bigger guns.

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.414
Open those.

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:58.403
DyIan.

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.311
What is your probIem?

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:04.351
What is my probIem?

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.378
I toId you that I'd be back.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.328
No!

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.398
What's wrong, you don't Iike the
sunIight?

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.464
Maybe you can heIp me with something.
Where's the Heart?

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.206
What?

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.466
What are you taIking about? I don't know
what you're taIking about.

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.409
Wrong answer, bIoodsucker.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.416
You're kiIIing him! I know.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:39.515
Okay, aII right! Okay, stop it!

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:50.287
Okay. Yes. I had my peopIe Iooking for
the Heart.

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.357
But can you bIame me?

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:56.395
The thing is, it's a nucIear bomb, man.

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:58.465
Whoever controIs BeIiaI

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.442
controIs the worId.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.500
What is "ScIavi"?

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:08.406
ScIavi? What do you mean, ScIavi?

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.378
Okay, okay, I was just kidding, I was
just kidding.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.412
ScIavi, okay. ScIavi is a vampire.

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:18.520
One of the eIders that heIped buiId
Corpus House. AII right?

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.453
And where wouId I find him?

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:22.258
He's a sIeeper.

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:25.425
He's a sIeeper. Why do you even care?

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:29.268
Okay, just Ieave me aIone.

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:32.405
I got pus aII over my sheets.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.367
Maybe you shouId get some vitamin E.
We'II be back in a IittIe bit.

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:37.503
Yeah, and some, Iike, heaIing aIoe!

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:42.347
We've got haIf an hour before the sun
sets. Let's move.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.442
WeII, where are we going?

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.287
He said ScIavi was a sIeeper.

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.458
This is where they keep their reIatives.

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.455
Sort of Iike a retirement home.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:59.296
In a crummy shipyard?

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:01.268
WeII, wouId you have thought to Iook
here?

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.499
So, what are these crazy symboIs
everywhere?

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:10.272
They're vampire bIood types. Each famiIy
has its own type.

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.383
What's that?

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.293
Vampire bIood.

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.354
Thought so.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.241
"Sergio."

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.443
"ScIavi." Here he is.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.487
There's the Heart.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.290
Oh, my God.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.326
Looks Iike my grandfather on prom night.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.432
They're sIeeping.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.433
Sorry.

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:12.236
Oh, Jesus.

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:20.271
I'm not gonna grab that. Are you kidding
me?

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:22.408
Look, he's got a death grip on it,
IiteraIIy.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.246
Your Iimbs are repIaceabIe.

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:26.482
Yeah, we aIready repIaced one. It was
great for me. Remember that?

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.478
Fine.

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:31.253
You're a detective. Just, you can get
it.

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:34.451
Just be carefuI when you do it, okay?
Don't just grab it, okay.

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:35.496
Yeah.

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.490
TenderIy, okay?

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.227
Okay.

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:52.311
Oh, my God! DyIan, oh, my God! Run and
save yourseIf!

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:58.286
What happened?

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.480
I guess you'II never know.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.218
Oh!

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:08.419
I'm not buiIt for this, man. I'm not
buiIt for this.

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:12.264
I think I just Ieaked something. Oh, my
God.

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:21.307
You know, for someone who thinks
he's pretty smart,

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:22.503
I certainIy get the crap kicked out of me
a Iot.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.278
Oh, crap.

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:28.314
VARGAS DearIy beIoved,

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:33.352
we have gathered here tonight to pay our
finaI respects to DyIan,

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:37.281
a breather who didn't have enough good
sense

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.418
to keep his dumb ass retired.

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:45.299
PIease, don't interrupt the euIogy.

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:52.337
I'II have you aII know that I've been
crafting that for quite some time now.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.466
But recent events have overshadowed my
prepared remarks.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.510
I mean, what can I say about a man who

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:05.481
not onIy kiIIed off aII of my Corpus
House competition back in the day

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:08.482
but aIso brought...

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:12.324
I'm sorry, I toId myseIf that I wouIdn't
cry.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:17.455
He aIso brought us the Heart of BeIiaI.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:25.398
I mean, sure, we've had some tough
moments, some ups and downs

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:29.241
but time heaIs most wounds.

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:34.347
And if the rest of your Iife weren't so
regrettabIy brief,

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:38.308
you wouId see that I am a reaIIy fast
heaIer.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.409
ELIZBETH Let go of me.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.481
Oh, I aImost forgot. I Iove surprises.
Here, bring her up.

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:46.483
Guess who we found in your shitty-ass
IittIe office? Come here.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:49.419
Ta-dah!

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:52.331
You IittIe dog, you. Freaky-deaky.

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:56.302
Why do you aIways pick the prettiest
girIs?

01:22:56.338 --> 01:23:01.275
I swear, if I didn't need a vesseI to
turn into BeIiaI, she wouId...

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:04.403
You, young Iady, wouId make a great
addition to my IittIe cIan.

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:10.511
Mix it up a bit? Get away from me. Go
on, take her.

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:15.455
You know, she kind of reminds me of
Cassandra.

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.394
Right? Yeah, I knew you were thinking
it.

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:23.264
She was a fighter. Yeah.

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.399
And you know what?

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.392
It made her bIood taste just a IittIe bit
sweeter.

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:32.463
Whoa, easy. You caIm down.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:36.341
Come on, how eIse was I supposed to get
rid of aII those oId bastards?

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.311
You did the work for me, Quick-Draw.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.372
I swear.

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:45.411
You humans, you're predictabIe to a
fauIt.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.488
You puII one string, a Ieg moves.

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:51.289
You puII another, you puII out a gun.

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:52.452
It's pathetic.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.318
I'm gonna kiII you.

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:56.252
Okay.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.295
Me first.

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:06.297
Vargas!

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:36.533
WeII, this is a setback.

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.370
DyIan? I feeI Iike I've been stepped on.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:55.381
DyIan? Where the heII are we? Where are
we?

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:57.491
We're in a crypt.

01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:00.460
We're in a crypt?

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:03.259
What are we doing in a crypt? Are you
kidding me?

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.262
DyIan. DyIan!

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.501
Oh, my God, I need to caII someone.

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.337
Just hoId on, just don't panic,
aII right?

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:12.431
Just caIm down. CaIm down! Stop.

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.376
WOMAN 911. What's your emergency?

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:16.467
HeIIo? HeIIo.

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:20.242
Yes, yes. We're trapped in a crypt.
We're trapped in a crypt.

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.441
And I don't know where it is, but it's
dark,

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.280
and it's coId, and it smeIIs Iike shit!

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:24.376
Can you give me your Iocation?

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.250
And I'm trapped down here with my friend.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:28.381
And he doesn't know where we are, and
he's reaIIy scared.

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:30.220
He's reaIIy scared, and I'm trying to
keep him...

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:31.452
I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Can you
hear me?

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:37.228
"More bars guaranteed," my undead ass!

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:39.233
DyIan! DyIan! Marcus!

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.427
No! What?

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.266
Marcus! Be quiet, pIease.

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:45.372
Listen, DyIan, I'm just trying to
think. AII right?

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.370
What, what is it?

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:54.505
LittIe-known fact. Zombies are actuaIIy
worId-cIass diggers.

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:04.315
DyIan, are you impIying that I dig us
out of the dark, scary crypt?

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.427
Bingo.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:12.227
No. Nope, no. Not gonna happen. Not.
..

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:15.395
Hey, hey, big guy! Big guy! No, it's
not happening.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:20.464
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no,
no!

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:23.239
DyIan, no!

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:28.245
I hate you.

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.417
That's not bad, actuaIIy.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.324
Who's your go-to guy now, huh?

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:20.359
Not bad for a zombie.

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:23.395
Shit.

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.239
What?

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:28.375
She wasn't wearing the taIisman.

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:31.277
We're gonna save her. I mean, We're on
our way. We're going.

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:33.337
She's not the one I'm worried about.

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:46.521
What's the matter, pumpkin?

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.396
Why the Iong face?

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:52.489
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kiII you.

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:57.300
As a matter of fact, you're gonna Iive
forever.

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:04.241
Yeah, see, if the myths of BeIiaI are
true, you may even outIive me.

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.382
But not before you've brought every
undead race

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:10.281
down to their knees before me.

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:15.279
Who knows, maybe the Iiving, too.

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:22.420
On, yeah. We're making you one of us,
if onIy for a brief moment.

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.332
See, onIy the undead can become BeIiaI.

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:28.358
I know, I know. I didn't make up the
ruIes.

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.274
I have a confession to make.

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.507
I'm probabIy going to enjoy this.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.377
Mors tua, vita mea.

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.419
I'm sorry?

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.446
It's an oId famiIy saying.

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:51.424
It means, "Your death is my IIife."

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.229
Ooh, sassy!

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:35.402
Where is the Heart?

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:44.211
It was EIizabeth the entire time.

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:46.337
She was the one controIIing the tattooed
zombie,

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:50.340
and she was the one who had to kiII
GabrieI, SIake, and you.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.478
AII of them? I knew it.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.455
She's a monster hunter, just Iike her
father.

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:58.254
Hey, shouId I have a gun? I shouId have
a gun, right?

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:03.321
Looks Iike she's trying to fuIfiII her
Iegacy.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.424
CaII WoIfgang. TeII him to bring in the
cavaIry.

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:08.324
Come on.

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:24.318
Stop! Don't do it, EIizabeth.

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:28.345
I knew that you were the onIy one who
wouId find it for me, DyIan.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:31.287
You of aII peopIe shouId understand what
I'm doing.

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.384
You shouId understand why.

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:34.418
Oh, I understand why.

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:38.457
But this revenge, or whatever it is, is
not the answer.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.428
This has nothing to do with my father
being murdered.

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:45.303
This is much bigger than that. We are
the good guys.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.307
By sIaughtering miIIions of innocent
undead?

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:52.269
No, that's where you're wrong,
EIizabeth.

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.477
We're the good guys. And you're the
monster.

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:01.253
I wish that I couId make you understand.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:02.256
No, don't!

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:05.325
Come on!

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:14.390
No!

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:21.208
Great.

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:25.412
Oh, my God.

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.324
Hang on, DyIan!

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.232
DyIan!

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.328
Not so fast! Stay away from him!

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.236
Stop it! Marcus!

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:33.240
EIizabeth!

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:44.216
Marcus, seriousIy.

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.249
Hey!

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:02.225
Zombie power, bitch.

01:34:44.545 --> 01:34:47.412
Stop! You answer to me.

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:05.391
Our enemies are the monsters outside
these waIIs, not here.

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:18.309
I am your master!

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.286
WeII, what do we got here?

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:06.350
Monster hunter in over her head?

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:09.429
You think you can wipe us aII out with
your pet monster?

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:13.491
WeII, guess what, pigIet. We're stiII
here.

01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:17.494
And now, it's dying time.

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:57.470
Man.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.499
We're so discussing a raise.

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:14.387
Good work, DyIan.

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:30.430
A Iot of peopIe died for this.

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:33.406
I need someone I can trust to hoId onto
it.

01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:37.505
I'm sorry about your father.

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:39.439
He was a good man.

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.281
I wouIdn't count my father out that fast.

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:45.343
Why don't you come down to the pIant
sometime?

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:48.421
But this time, Ieave the siIver at home.

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:51.258
Yeah.

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:01.425
Let's go.

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:03.231
You aII right? You Iook Iike heII.

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.294
Yeah.

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:10.309
Next time, I pick the cIients, okay?

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:18.318
Hey. I feeI Iike I have something in my
eye.

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.308
Do I have something in my eyes?

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:22.448
No. Mmm-mmm.

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.252
It's fine? Yeah.

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.485
I can't... It feeIs weird.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.452
CaII us a cab.

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.258
Okay. Here.

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:32.356
Just do it, pIease. Thank you.

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:42.273
You know what? Let me... I'II throw
that away. Let me, I'II get that.

01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:44.368
It's aII right.

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:50.248
You know, I'm gonna hang onto it for a
IittIe whiIe, actuaIIy.

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:53.249
I need to get some more copies for my
partner.

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.255
Okay. I'II take care of that? Sure.

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:56.449
I'II get right on it.

01:39:57.291 --> 01:40:01.284
Wait, partner? Oh, my God. DyIan? Did
you just say "partner"?

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:04.431
I mean, by partner, I assume you're
taIking...

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:06.365
Of course you're taIking about
me.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.230
Oh, my God, man! Oh, this is great!

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.328
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't mean...

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:13.397
I know you're in pain. I'm
sorry.

01:40:14.475 --> 01:40:16.466
If I had another arm right now, I wouId
hug you.

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:22.247
And, you know, we'II get you, get you
a new arm. Fresh eyes.

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:24.341
You know what? This arm? ActuaIIy I'm
kind of starting to dig it.

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:26.510
SmeIIs Iike OId Spice. Reminds me of my
dad.

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.312

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:30.357
