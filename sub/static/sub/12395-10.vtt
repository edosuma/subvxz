00:14.140 --> 00:16.370
- ALL RIGHT, SHAWN.
SAY A FEW WORDS.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.241
LET'S WRAP THIS UP SO I CAN
GET THIS DEAD THING

00:18.280 --> 00:19.679
OFF MY KITCHEN TABLE.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.142
- I'M NOT READY YET.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.249
- SHAWN, NOT AGAIN.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.508
YOU LEFI' THE HAMSTER
IN THE FREEZER FOR TWO MONTHS

00:24.550 --> 00:26.518
WHILE YOU HEMMED AND HAWED
OVER THE APPROPRIATENESS

00:26.560 --> 00:27.549
OF A BURIAL AT SEA.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.581
NOW JUST SAY SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT YOUR LIZARD

00:29.630 --> 00:33.828
BEFORE RIGOR MORTIS SETS IN,
HE BLOATS, AND HIS ARMS POP OFF.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.763
- OKAY.
FINE.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.769
LIZARDY. ..UH . ..

00:41.800 --> 00:46.271
YOU WERE FOUND IN THE YARD
ON A REALLY GREAT DAY.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.107
YOU CAME TO THIS HOUSE
AS MY PRISONER

00:51.210 --> 00:54.179
YOU LEFI' AS MY FRIEND.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.183
- SH--SHAW--

01:00.220 --> 01:02.324
- I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS
RIGHT NOW.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.759

01:03.790 --> 01:05.121
[door slams]

01:05.160 --> 01:09.494
OKAY, I'LL BURY HIM MYSELF.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.645
- YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.284
- UM...

01:32.320 --> 01:34.652
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO
VERY MUCH.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.658
[coughs]
BUT WE ARE SO LATE, GUS.

01:36.690 --> 01:40.353
AND THESE COFFEE CUPS ARE NOT
GONNA PUT THEMSELVES AWAY.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.890
- YOU TAKE A TRIP
WITH THE INTENTION OF PROPOSING

01:41.930 --> 01:44.364
AND DON'T TELL ME, YOUR
OLDEST AND BLACKEST FRIEND?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.891
- I CALLED YOU EIGHT TIMES
ON THAT TRIP.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.794
- I'M NOT LETTING YOU OFF
ON A TECHNICALITY, SHAWN.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.569
- LOOK...

01:50.610 --> 01:51.759
IT'S MY EMERGENCY RING.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.232
- THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.338
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.348
WHAT IF THE PERFECT PROPOSAL
MOMENT PRESENTS ITSELF?

01:56.380 --> 01:57.904
I GO'I'I'A BE READY.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.918
I MEAN, WHAT IF OUR FACES

01:59.950 --> 02:01.872
SUDDENLY POP UP
ON THE JUMBOTRON

02:01.920 --> 02:03.342
OR I GET SELECTED
FROM THE AUDIENCE

02:03.390 --> 02:05.517
TO FEED SHAMU AT SEA WORLD?

02:05.550 --> 02:07.211
I GO'I'I'A BE READY FOR THAT.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.488
- YOU'RE ACTUALLY READY
TO BE MARRIED?

02:08.520 --> 02:11.523
- NO.
WELL, SOMEDAY MAYBE.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.891
NOT ANYTIME SOON.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.649
LOOK, THAT IS--IT'S
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RING, OKAY?

02:15.700 --> 02:17.395
I CAN BARELY LOOK AT IT.

02:17.430 --> 02:18.863
NOW CAN WE PLEASE GO?

02:18.900 --> 02:20.765
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
AT THE MUSEUM AN HOUR AGO.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.200
THAT SHIPMENT'S GONNA
GET THERE BEFORE WE DO.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.376
- FINE.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.203
- THANK YOU.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.899
I'M PUTI'ING
THIS THING AWAY.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.441
JUST KNOW IF I EVER DO
POP THE QUESTION,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.345
I WANT YOU ON ONE SIDE,
JULES ON THE OTHER

02:36.390 --> 02:39.416
JUST AS A KILLER WHALE
LEAPS OVER OUR HEADS

02:39.460 --> 02:40.882
TO GRAB A MACKEREL.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.649
- THAT'S STORYBOOK
RIGHT THERE.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.833
SHAWN,
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.304
- I WOULDN'T BE STUCK IF IT
WASN'T FOR YOUR STUPID WATCH.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.715
[groans]

03:07.750 --> 03:09.809
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

03:09.850 --> 03:11.249
- NOTHING!
SMALL, LITI'LE PROBLEM.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.188
DON'T BE CONCERNED.

03:12.220 --> 03:14.359
- HE THOUGHT HE SAW
A CANDY BAR INSIDE.

03:14.390 --> 03:16.483
- THERE IS A RENOIR,
A DEGAS,

03:16.530 --> 03:17.758
A VAN GOGH,

03:17.790 --> 03:19.894
AND AN IRREPLACEABLE
COLLECTION

03:19.930 --> 03:23.263
OF HISTORICAL ARTIFACT S
IN THIS SHIPMENT.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.736
WHY WOULD THERE BE A HERSHEY
BAR IN THE SAME CONTAINER?

03:26.770 --> 03:29.568
- I KNOW INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
IS QUITE EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.861
- IN HIS DEFENSE,
HE THOUGHT IT WAS

03:30.910 --> 03:32.935
THAT COOL, EUROPEAN CANDY
THAT TASTES LIKE SALT.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.869
- AHH!

03:35.910 --> 03:38.276
OH.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.311
OOH.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.544
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ANYWAY?

03:40.580 --> 03:42.445
- WE'RE ALWAYS HERE WHENEVER
A VALUABLE SHIPMENT COMES IN.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.310
- TO SENSE TROUBLE.
- AND COLLECT A CHECK.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.886
- BUT MOSTLY SENSE TROUBLE.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.887
SEE, I AM A PSYCHIC,

03:46.920 --> 03:48.410
AND WE ARE VERY VALUABLE
TO THIS MUSEUM COMPLEX.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.688
- WE DISCOVERED THE DINOSAUR

03:49.730 --> 03:51.322
OVER AT
THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.328
- DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.429
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE DUDE
THAT DISCOVERED

03:54.460 --> 03:56.496
A TYRANNOSAURUS REX
AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.

03:56.530 --> 03:57.497
- THAT'S US.

03:57.530 --> 04:00.465
- I AM CHRISTOPHER HOLM.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.365
- CHRIS HOLM?
CHRISSY HOLM?

04:02.410 --> 04:03.729
NO?
YOU HAVE ANY NICKNAMES?

04:03.770 --> 04:05.465
- I'M THE CURATOR
OF THIS MUSEUM.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.968
AND I DID NOT SIGN OFF
ON YOU OR YOU.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.841
- WELL, YOU NEED
TO CHECK YOUR FACTS, JACK,

04:10.880 --> 04:12.871
BECAUSE WE ARE MUSEUM HEROES.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.672
- SO YOU'RE
KIND OF STUCK WITH US.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.449
- DON'T CHECK HIM THOUGH.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.048
THEY GOT YOUR NAME WRONG
ON THE PLAQUE.

04:18.090 --> 04:19.648
- OH, TWICE!

04:19.690 --> 04:21.715
THE FIRST TIME,
THEY CALLED ME BRUTON GASTER.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.557
AND THEN THEY SWITCHED IT TO
BRUTAL HUSTLER ON THE NEW ONE.

04:23.590 --> 04:24.852
- HE LIKES IT.
- WELL, I DON'T MIND IT.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.050
- HE DOESN'T WANT 'EM
TO CHANGE IT.

04:26.090 --> 04:28.524
- YOU CAN CALL ME BRUTAL.
- RIGHT.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.528
RIGHT.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.662
WELL, AS OF NOW,

04:31.700 --> 04:32.962
YOU ARE REASSIGNED.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.538
- OKAY.
- ET TU, BRUTE.

04:36.570 --> 04:37.832
- TAL.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.735
BRU-TAL.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.771
- GET OUT OF HERE!

04:43.010 --> 04:44.807
- REALLY?
WE'RE GUARDING A WALL?

04:44.850 --> 04:47.444
- IT'S PROBABLY
A PRE'ITY IMPORTANT WALL.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.538
MAN, THIS NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

04:50.590 --> 04:51.841
IF YOU HAD REACHED
FOR THAT CANDY.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.050
- HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT?

04:53.090 --> 04:54.057
- 'CAUSE MY ARMS
ARE WAY BIGGER THAN YOURS.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.057
- PLEASE.

04:55.090 --> 04:57.854
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
LEAVE ME ALONE.

04:57.890 --> 04:58.982
- HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.691
- GET AWAY FROM ME.

05:00.730 --> 05:01.856
- I SHOULD PROBABLY HELP HER.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.367
- HELP HER DO WHAT,
RUN AWAY?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.027
- I'LL REMIND YOU,
I'VE HAD 11 KUNG FU LESSONS.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.537
- YOU TOOK FOUR,
MISSED SIX,

05:06.570 --> 05:07.662
AND SLEPT THROUGH
THE LAST ONE.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.689
- I WAS MEDITATING!

05:08.740 --> 05:09.707
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I DON'T NEED THIS.

05:09.740 --> 05:10.707
HEY!

05:10.740 --> 05:12.537
YOU GET YOUR DAMN HANDS
OFF HER!

05:12.580 --> 05:13.979
- REALLY, YOU'RE
GONNA THREATEN THEM

05:14.010 --> 05:15.432
BY QUOTING
BACK TO THE FUTURE?

05:20.550 --> 05:22.108
- HEY!

05:22.150 --> 05:23.947
WAH!

05:27.020 --> 05:28.009
YOU OKAY?

05:28.060 --> 05:29.584
- OH, MY GOD,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.518
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.492
- WHAT?

05:32.530 --> 05:34.088
- I KNOW WHAT I JUST DID
WAS INCREDIBLY COOL,

05:34.130 --> 05:35.825
BUT I NEED TO GET
THAT OUT OF THE WAY

05:35.860 --> 05:37.964
BECAUSE I'M SENSING THAT YOU
WERE HAVING ROMANTIC FEELINGS.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.695
- NO, ACTUALLY I'M JUST
CONCERNED ABOUT MY WALLET.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.764
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.131
YOUR WALLET
AND THEN THE PASSION,

05:42.170 --> 05:43.330
THE BURNING PASSION.

05:43.370 --> 05:46.373
JUST NEGATE THOSE FEELINGS,
BECAUSE I'M OFF THE MARKET.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.479
- THAT WAS PRETI'Y AMAZING.

05:47.510 --> 05:48.875
I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT
ANYMORE, RIGHT?

05:48.910 --> 05:50.468
I MEAN,
THEY COULDA KILLED ME,

05:50.510 --> 05:52.512
AND YOU JUST TOOK
YOUR LIFE IN YOUR HANDS.

05:52.550 --> 05:53.949
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT'S ALMOST AS IF I A'I'I'ENDED

05:53.980 --> 05:55.971
ALL OF MY
MARTIAL ARTS CLASSES.

05:56.020 --> 05:56.839
- AND THEN SOME.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.482
- YEAH, AND YOU WOULD
NEVER SUSPECT

05:58.520 --> 05:59.657
THAT ONE DAY
I MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP

05:59.690 --> 06:00.816
AND THE INSTRUCTOR
USED MY KNEES

06:00.860 --> 06:03.658
TO BALANCE THE BOARDS THAT
THEY WERE CHOPPING IN HALF.

06:03.690 --> 06:04.827
- NO, NO.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.851
- I THINK WHAT THIS WOMAN
IS TRYING TO SAY HERE, GUS,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.151
IS THAT YOU CAN SUCK IT.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.519
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
- I'M PARAPHRASING.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.889
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT "PARAPHRASE" MEANS?

06:10.930 --> 06:12.397
- IT MEANS,
"SUCK IT PLEASE, GUS."

06:12.440 --> 06:13.566
- IT DOESN'T MEAN
"SUCK IT PLEASE, GUS."

06:13.600 --> 06:14.965
- OKAY, WELL, YOU WERE BOTH
VERY BRAVE.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.763
- MISS, PLEASE,
STAY OUT OF THIS.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.437
OTHERWISE, HE'LL NEVER LEARN.

06:18.470 --> 06:22.406
BESIDES, HE WAS LOBBYING
FOR LEAVING YOU HERE TO DIE.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.509
[loud crash]

06:24.550 --> 06:25.801
UH-OH.
- OH, MY GOD.

06:25.850 --> 06:26.646
- UM...

06:26.680 --> 06:29.513
- UH, EXCUSE US
WHILE OUR LIVES END.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.082
- THANK YOU.

06:42.770 --> 06:47.662
- I GUESS THAT WAS
A PRETI'Y IMPORTANT WALL.

[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

06:51.770 --> 06:55.137
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:55.180 --> 06:57.808
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

06:57.850 --> 06:59.442
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

06:59.480 --> 07:00.845
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:00.880 --> 07:02.518
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

07:02.550 --> 07:05.986
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU
OUT IN THE END *

07:12.190 --> 07:13.691
- I WANT HIM JAILED.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.028
- MR. HOLM, AS MUCH
AS THAT IDEA PLEASES ME,

07:16.060 --> 07:18.597
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY PUT SOMEONE
IN JAIL FOR BEING STUPID.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.892
- OR FOR BEING
A GOOD SAMARITAN.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.794
- OR STUPID!

07:21.840 --> 07:23.603
IT DOES BEAR REPEATING.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.005
- EXCUSE ME.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.179
WE DID SAVE A WOMAN--
A FINE WOMAN AT THAT.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.030
- YOU DIDN'T MENTION
THAT SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.968
- I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.238
- YES, YOU DO.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.817
- OH, THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.
A PSYCHIC INDEED!

07:34.850 --> 07:36.215
YOU ARE NOT WHAT
YOU CLAIM TO BE.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.786
AND I HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.515
I HOLD YOU ALL RESPONSIBLE!

07:39.560 --> 07:42.211
- YOU CAN NO MORE DO THAT THEN I
CAN SUPPRESS MY HEROIC INSTINCT S

07:42.260 --> 07:43.784
OR GUS CAN CONTROL HIS BLADDER
DURING INTERCOURSE.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.024
- WHAT?

07:45.060 --> 07:47.096
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- IT'S NOT TRUE.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.256
- IT'S CONJECTURE.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.722
LOOK, GUYS,
WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE HERE.

07:49.770 --> 07:54.161
IT'S ONLY BEEN
A SHORT TIME, ASSUMINGLY.

07:58.110 --> 08:02.171
AND I CAN TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHERE THAT CRATE IS,

08:02.210 --> 08:06.203
RIGHT DOWN TO
THE GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATES.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.911
- THIS IS FRUITLESS, SHAWN.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.952
YOU MADE A GUARANTEE BASED
ON ME BEING ABLE TO DO

08:12.990 --> 08:15.754
A REVERSE GPS SEARCH
ON AN $80 HIKING WATCH.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.054
IT NEEDS TO HAVE
THE DISTRESS SIGNAL ON TO WORK.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.057
- I AGREE.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.899
WE NEED A PROFESSIONAL
AT THIS SORT OF THING.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.568
- EXACTLY, WHICH
IS WHY WE NEED TO FORGET

08:22.600 --> 08:23.862
THIS PSYCHIC THING FOR ONCE

08:23.900 --> 08:25.299
AND GIVE THE INFORMATION
TO THE COPS.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.264
- BELIEVE ME, I WOULD,
BUT THE COPS DON'T EVEN HAVE

08:27.300 --> 08:28.961
THE KIND OF FIREPOWER WE NEED.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.036
- DUDE, IF YOU SUGGEST
BATMAN ONE MORE TIME,

08:31.070 --> 08:32.571
I WILL PULL OUT
YOUR EARDRUMS.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.872
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
A PRO, GUS.

08:33.910 --> 08:34.934
A PRO'S PRO.

08:34.980 --> 08:35.799
I'VE ALREADY CALLED HIM

08:35.840 --> 08:37.171
AND DOWNLOADED HIM
ON THE SITUATION.

08:37.210 --> 08:40.816
- REALLY?
AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?

08:40.850 --> 08:42.943
- SOMEBODY CALL
FOR AN ART THIEF?

08:44.590 --> 08:45.818
HELLO, BARTON.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.222
- CAN YOU JUST GIVE US
AN APPROXIMATE VALUE

08:54.260 --> 08:55.591
OF THE COLLECTION?

08:55.630 --> 08:57.928
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

08:57.970 --> 09:01.633
COULD YOU PUT A VALUE
ON YOUR OWN FATHER?

09:01.670 --> 09:03.638

09:03.670 --> 09:05.206

WE WERE GOING TO EXHIBIT

09:07.280 --> 09:08.975
IN THE FOYER.

THESE ARE JUST SOME
OF THE PIECES OF ART

09:12.310 --> 09:15.313
FROM THE FEW ARTIFACT S

09:19.760 --> 09:21.819
HE'S THE RICH GUY
WHO BUILT THE AIRPLANES.

ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN
IN THE WORLD BY THE AGE OF 32.

09:26.030 --> 09:28.658
HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE
TRYING TO SPEND HIS MONEY.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.863
HE COLLECTED ART
WITH THE PASSION

09:31.900 --> 09:33.868
OF A RENAISSANCE PRINCE.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.959

09:36.000 --> 09:38.264

OF HIS DEATH,

09:49.690 --> 09:52.147
WHICH WAS LAST THURSDAY,

09:52.190 --> 09:55.114
HIS ENTIRE COLLECTION SHOULD
BE REMOVED FROM THE LOUVRE

09:55.160 --> 09:58.652
AND BROUGHT TO THE
SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM OF ART.

09:58.690 --> 09:59.793
- WHERE IT STAYED
FOR EXACTLY ONE HOUR

09:59.830 --> 10:01.752
UNTIL YOUR BOYFRIEND LOST IT.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.119

FOR YOUR LOSS.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.197

WORKING ON IT.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.935

10:12.980 --> 10:15.130
YOU DO REALIZE I AM FINISHED,
DON'T YOU?

10:15.180 --> 10:22.245
I WILL BE KNOWN AS THE MAN
WHO LOST THE YERDEN MASTERS.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.840
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU'RE ON TRIAL.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.039

YOU'RE ON TRIAL RIGHT NOW

10:27.960 --> 10:29.359
FOR DOING
THIS SAME EXACT THING.

10:29.390 --> 10:32.257
OH, MY GOSH,

10:32.290 --> 10:36.090
- OH, PLEASE, BRAXTON,
THIS WAS BRASH, VIOLENT.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.392
COMMITTED BY A TEAM.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.398
EVERYONE KNOWS
I WORK ALONE.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.933
IT WAS SO...INELEGANT.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.874
I WAS IN COURT
WHILE IT HAPPENED.

10:46.910 --> 10:47.877
- CHECK ON THAT.

10:47.910 --> 10:50.105

MY TRIAL ENDS

10:53.380 --> 10:55.018
AND MY ACQUI'ITAL HAS
BEEN EVIDENT SINCE DAY TWO.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.711

A FONDNESS FOR SHAWN.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.897
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME
THE PROGRAM

11:08.930 --> 11:12.832
YOU'RE USING TO LOCATE
THIS GPS SIGNAL?

11:14.740 --> 11:17.834
- OOH, HIS IS MUCH BIGGER.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.838
- THIS IS GOING TO TAKE ME
A FEW HOURS.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.700
- THAT'S PERFECT, 'CAUSE
I'M GONNA NEED SOME TIME TOO

11:21.740 --> 11:23.469
IF WE'RE GOING AFTER
THIS TREASURE.

WITH DESPEREAUX,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.012
IT ALWAYS ENDS BADLY.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.189
- YOUR GLASS
IS ALWAYS HALF-EMPTY.

IT'S HARD BEING ME SOMETIMES.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.386
- EXCUSE ME,
IT'S MY WATCH.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.285
- WHY DO YOU NEED A WATCH
WITH A DISTRESS SIGNAL?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.025
- FOR HIKING, SHAWN.
- YOU DON'T HIKE.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.948
- I PLAN TO HIKE.
- PLAYERS DON'T HIKE.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.228
- MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT PLAYERS DO.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.329
- WHAT DO THEY DO?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.258
- PLAYERS HIKE
DEEP INTO THE WOODS,

12:50.300 --> 12:51.927
THEY GET LOST,
THEY DEVELOP HYPOTHERMIA,

12:51.970 --> 12:55.269
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY NEED GPS.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.030
WAIT A SECOND, THEY'RE
LEAVING ALL THE PAINTINGS?

12:58.070 --> 12:59.560
WHY ARE THEY ABANDONING
THE EXPENSIVE STUFF?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.471
OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.
WHAT WAS THAT THING?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.044
- IT WAS
A CIVIL WAR ERA DAGGER.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.843
ONLY ABOUT 500 OF THEM
WERE MADE.

13:10.890 --> 13:11.948
- REALLY?
WHAT'S IT WORTH?

13:11.990 --> 13:13.480
- OH, ABOUT $9,000 MAYBE.

AS THEY COME.

13:33.910 --> 13:36.071

13:36.110 --> 13:40.012
QUESTION IS:
WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?

A WOMAN LIKE THAT DOESN'T
MESS WITH A VAN GOGH.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.188
UNLESS...

13:46.220 --> 13:50.122
UNLESS SHE'S GOING AFTER
THE CORE COLLECTION.

WENT TO THE GRAVE BEFORE
HE MANAGED TO TELL ANYBODY

14:02.140 --> 14:04.267
WHAT OR WHERE IT WAS.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.006
A DAGGER WAS SAID
TO PROTECT THE COLLECTION.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.132
- I THINK YOU MEAN DRAGON.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.308
- NO, I MEAN DAGGER.

INFORMATION BACK TO THE POLICE

14:15.050 --> 14:16.517
SO WE CAN BE HEROES AGAIN.

- HOLD THAT THOUGHT
ONE MOMENT.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.187
- WHERE'S HE GOING?

14:25.930 --> 14:27.898
- SHAWN WAS SO DESPERATE
AT THE MUSEUM TODAY.

14:27.930 --> 14:29.227
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO DOWN.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.023

REALLY AFFECTED.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.288
HEY, TELL ME AGAIN

14:33.340 --> 14:35.069
WHEN THAT CURATOR
WAS BERATING HIM.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.362
DO YOU THINK HE WAS
HOLDING BACK TEARS?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.038
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
I REMEMBER IT.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.298

14:39.340 --> 14:41.035
ALLOW ME THIS ONE THING.
I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.274
- I JUST DON'T WANT THIS
TO RUIN HIM.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.641
- DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.238
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.508
- I KNOW SHAWN,
AND HE IS NOT WELL EQUIPPED

18:37.350 --> 18:39.170
- TURN IT.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.175
- WE'RE GOING RIGHT BACK
TO WHERE WE STARTED, SHAWN.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.814
- WELL, YOU'RE PUTTING A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON ME RIGHT NOW.

18:44.850 --> 18:45.817
- I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I GOT IT.

18:45.850 --> 18:46.817
I GOT IT.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.317
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.727
[gunshots]

18:51.760 --> 18:52.784
THIS WAY, THIS WAY.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.354
STARBOARD, STARBOARD,
THAT WAY.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.391
- IT DOES THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT
I'M TELLING IT TO DO.

18:56.430 --> 18:58.466
OOH, LABRADOODLE.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.196
[gunfire]

19:11.980 --> 19:13.618
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

19:16.750 --> 19:20.208
[engine sputtering]

19:38.340 --> 19:39.762
- ENGINE TROUBLE?

19:46.980 --> 19:48.845
- UH-OH.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.895
- WE WERE HOME
WHEN WE GOT THE CALL.

20:06.930 --> 20:08.659
WE ALMOST GOT LOST
FINDING THIS PLACE.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.860
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:09.900 --> 20:11.902
- I'M SO SORRY, SHAWN.
WE GOT AN I.D.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.305
IT'S DESPEREAUX.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.773
BUT THE GOOD NEWS
IS THE CRATE

20:14.810 --> 20:16.903
IS EXACTLY WHERE
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE

20:16.940 --> 20:18.646
IN THE FACTORY ALONG WITH
ALL OF THE OTHER PAINTINGS.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.238
THE MUSEUM'S GOING
TO BE ECSTATIC.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.440
- STRONG RALLY, SPENCER.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.914
JUST A FEW HOURS,
AND THE GUILTY PARTY

20:23.950 --> 20:25.918
IS ALREADY BLOWN
TO SMITHEREENS.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.417
- DESPEREAUX
DIDN'T DO THIS.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.258
- OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.
WHY WOULD I THINK HE DID?

20:30.290 --> 20:31.723
I MEAN, WE FOUND HIM,
WELL, PARTS OF HIM

20:31.760 --> 20:33.819
300 YARDS
FROM THE STOLEN GOODS.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.725
I MEAN,
IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL AT BEST.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.954
- CARLTON.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.719
- LOOK, THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT WE SAVED THE TAXPAYERS

20:39.770 --> 20:40.839
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

20:40.870 --> 20:43.430
AND I'VE GOT A NEW SLOT
ON MY HOME MOST WANTED WALL.

20:43.470 --> 20:45.768
GOOD-BYE, DESPEREAUX.
HELLO, CAROLINE KAPICKI.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.300
MURDEROUS HOUSEWIFE
FROM OJAI,

20:47.340 --> 20:48.773
WHO'S ALSO KIND OF A LOOKER,
SO...THAT'S A PLUS.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.607
- LASSITER, PLEASE,
PRETEND YOU'RE A PERSON.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.878
- RIGHT.

20:51.910 --> 20:55.573
SPENCER, I AM SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

20:55.620 --> 20:56.746
BUT DESPEREAUX
WAS CRIMINAL TRASH,

20:56.780 --> 21:00.045
SO ESSENTIALLY
THAT MEANS I WIN.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.558
- DESPEREAUX
DIDN'T DO IT, JULES.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.387
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A DARK-HAIRED WOMAN

21:04.430 --> 21:05.658
NAMED JACQUELINE.

21:05.690 --> 21:08.591
- WOW, THAT'S SO SPECIFIC.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.325
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.972
- MR. DESPEREAUX'S BELONGINGS

21:25.010 --> 21:28.309
WILL THEREFORE BE DISTRIBUTED
IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER.

21:28.350 --> 21:30.580
- I'M SORRY, YOU'RE HERE
FOR A WILL READING?

21:30.620 --> 21:31.985
SHOULDN'T THIS BE
AT YOUR OFFICE

21:32.020 --> 21:33.885
OR IN A ROOM FULL
OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS?

21:33.920 --> 21:36.411
- SADLY, MR. DESPEREAUX
DID NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT

21:36.460 --> 21:38.382
OF CLOSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.920
MR. SPENCER,
IF I MAY SPEAK CANDIDLY,

21:39.960 --> 21:42.849
YOU WERE REALLY
HIS ONLY FRIEND.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.095
HE LEFT YOU THE BULK
OF HIS POSSESSIONS.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.859
- NO, NO, NO, THANK YOU.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.595
THOSE ARE
INSTRUMENTS OF CRIME

21:48.640 --> 21:49.993
AND PROBABLY ALL STOLEN.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.598
- I'LL TAKE THIS THOUGH.
- YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.608
- WHAT ARE YOU, MY BOSS?
- I'M YOUR CONSCIENCE.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.369
- TONY COX IS MY CONSCIENCE!
- WHAT?

21:55.410 --> 21:57.878
- THERE'S THE MATTER OF
MR. DESPEREAUX'S CASH ACCOUNTS,

21:57.910 --> 22:00.105
ALL OF WHICH
WERE WILLED TO PSYCH.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.072
- HE WAS AN AMAZING MAN.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.883
- I KEEP THIS THEN.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.478
- THAT'S PACKING MATERIAL.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.080
- YOU HAVE YOUR VALUE SYSTEM,
AND I HAVE MINE.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.384
- MOST IMPORTANTLY,
THERE'S THE MATTER

22:10.430 --> 22:12.489
OF THE EULOGY.

22:12.530 --> 22:14.896
THIS WOULD SEEM
TO INDICATE TO ME

22:14.930 --> 22:16.750
THAT YOU, MR. SPENCER,

22:16.800 --> 22:18.495
ARE THE ONE
MOST SUITED FOR IT.

22:18.530 --> 22:20.020
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.038
NOW WHEN DO WE GET
OUR MONEY?

22:22.070 --> 22:24.504
- WELL, MOST OF
MR. DESPEREAUX'S ACCOUNTS

22:24.540 --> 22:26.462
WERE FROZEN
WHEN THE TRIAL BEGAN.

22:26.510 --> 22:27.579
- CAN'T DO IT, GUS.

22:27.610 --> 22:29.077
- YOU CAN GET YOUR MONEY
ANY WAY YOU WANT IT, SHAWN.

22:29.110 --> 22:31.078
EXCEPT FOR NICKELS.
I WILL NOT ALLOW THAT AGAIN.

22:31.110 --> 22:32.008
- I CAN'T DO THE EULOGY.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.847
- DO NOT INSULT THE MAN.
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.416
OF COURSE HE CAN.

22:35.450 --> 22:37.486
- IT'S TOO REAL.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.646
IT'S TOO SOON.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.581
- CAN WE DELAY THE FUNERAL?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

22:44.630 --> 22:46.689
IT'S A MATTER OF...
THE SMELL.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.652
- TOO STINKY, SHAWN.
GET TO WRITING.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.928
- NO!

22:49.960 --> 22:51.860
I'M NOT GONNA GET UP
IN FRONT OF 10,000 PEOPLE

22:51.900 --> 22:53.492
AND FACE THE REALITY
OF THE GRIM REAPER.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.666
- 10,000?

22:54.700 --> 22:55.928
- DEPENDING ON WHICH ARENA
WE BOOK.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.062
- YOU WERE THE ONLY FRIEND
HE HAD, SHAWN.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.829
- MALE.

22:58.870 --> 22:59.962
MALE FRIEND.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.034
- EXCUSE ME.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.548
- HE HAD PLENTY OF FEMALE
RELATIONSHIPS, BUT...

23:03.580 --> 23:04.808
- OH.

23:04.850 --> 23:05.976
- IT WOULD BE A SMALL CEREMONY.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.672
- OKAY, WELL, I WILL BE THERE,
FRONT ROW.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.540
I WILL START THE WAVE
IF NEED BE.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.182
- WELL, THAT FIGURES.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.812
THIS MAY BE
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

23:13.860 --> 23:15.418
JUST DANCE
IN THE FACE OF, GUS,

23:15.460 --> 23:17.428
BUT NOT ME.
NOT ME!

23:17.460 --> 23:18.984
I WILL NOT STAND UP THERE

23:19.030 --> 23:21.157
AND TALK ABOUT THE TRAGEDY
OF PIERRE'S LIFE.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.724
- TRAGEDY?

23:22.760 --> 23:24.091
- HE WAS ABOUT
TO BE ACQUITTED, YOU FOOL.

23:24.130 --> 23:25.597
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HIS LIFE,

23:25.630 --> 23:27.029
HE WASN'T GONNA
BE ON THE RUN.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.594
- PARDON ME,
BUT MR. DESPEREAUX

23:28.640 --> 23:30.096
WAS NOT ABOUT
TO BE ACQUITTED.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.131
- YOU SHUT
YOUR DRUNK MOUTH.

23:32.170 --> 23:33.706
HE TOLD ME AS MUCH.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.977
I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE A PLEA,

23:36.010 --> 23:39.002
BUT THE STATE WAS RELUCT ANT
BECAUSE WE HAD NO GROUNDS.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.642
- WHAT?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.875
NO, I'M--

23:51.890 --> 23:55.098
- UH, WILL HE BE MIC'D?

24:00.030 --> 24:01.190
- WAIT, I NEED
DESPEREAUX'S REMAINS.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.696
- I CAN'T SELL THEM
TO YOU, SHAWN.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.105
I'M KIND OF ON PROBATION
FOR THAT SORT OF THING.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.209
- I DON'T WANT TO OWN THEM.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.732
- GOOD, BECAUSE AS A HOBBY,
IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.475
- I JUST NEED TO SEE 'EM.

24:10.510 --> 24:11.807
- OKAY.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.545
BUT IT'S NOT AS FUN
AS IT SEEMS.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.615
- FIRST THING IN THE MORNING?

24:20.660 --> 24:24.221
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW...
IT'S 9:00 AM. SOMEWHERE.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.750
- I'M GOOD.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.020
- YOU KNOW, I'M GOOD TOO.

24:31.730 --> 24:34.597
PIERRE DESPEREAUX.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.892
- WHAT, THAT'S IT?
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.636
CAUSE OF DEATH,
DIABETES.

24:39.670 --> 24:42.173
I KID.
HE EXPLODED.

24:42.210 --> 24:44.678
WE HAVE TEETH,
PART OF A FOOT,

24:44.710 --> 24:46.940
HIS WALLET,
AND ODDLY ENOUGH

24:46.980 --> 24:48.072
A HANDFUL OF GUS' THINGS.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.248
- [chuckles]

24:51.290 --> 24:53.588
- I DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S FUNNY.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.781
[both laugh]

24:55.820 --> 24:57.048
OKAY, MAYBE IT IS.

24:57.090 --> 24:58.728
- WOODY, WOODY,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.057
THIS ISN'T DESPEREAUX.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.650
- WHAT?
- HE'S STILL ALIVE.

25:05.970 --> 25:07.835
- I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

25:07.870 --> 25:09.792
- HIS TRIAL
WAS GOING POORLY.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.637
HIS MONEY WAS FROZEN,

25:11.670 --> 25:13.604
AND THEN WE OFFERED
TO LEAD HIM

25:13.640 --> 25:15.278
TO A CRATE
OF STOLEN ART.

25:15.310 --> 25:18.609
SO HE FAKED HIS DEATH.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.242
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.771
AND WE DON'T HAVE
TO BE SAD.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.539
- SHAWN,
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.887
I'M AFRAID
THE DENTAL RECORDS MATCH.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.148
- NO.
- YES.

25:28.190 --> 25:29.817
WE HAVE
A PARTIAL PRINT, SHAWN.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.088
WE HAVE EVERYTHING
BUT THE DNA,

25:31.130 --> 25:32.222
AND THAT
WILL BE IN SHORTLY.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.227
IT'S HIM.

25:33.260 --> 25:36.696
- TRUST ME ON THIS ONE,
WOODY.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.869
THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.959
- SHAWN.
- HEY!

25:44.010 --> 25:45.705
DON'T RAIN ON IT.
I'VE GOT A PARADE GOING HERE.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.162
- SHAWN,
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.178
HE'S GONE.
DEAL WITH IT.

25:49.210 --> 25:50.700
- HE'S NOT GONE!
HE'S TOO GOOD.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.047
- YOU'VE BEEN HIDING
FROM THE PAIN OF DEATH

25:52.080 --> 25:53.672
EVER SINCE YOU WERE A KID.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.676
LET IT HURT.
IT'S GONNA HURT.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.984
- THE ONLY THING
THAT'S GONNA HURT IS YOUR PRIDE

25:58.020 --> 26:02.719
WHEN I PROVE THAT DESPEREAUX
IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.679
- WHAT IF HE ISN'T?

26:13.670 --> 26:15.695
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.298
- ADDING ANOTHER JOKE.

26:17.340 --> 26:20.002
- TO THE EULOGY?

26:20.040 --> 26:22.338
- PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
DEALING WITH DEATH.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.598
OKAY, GUS?
THEY WANT JOKES.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.844
THEY WANT
JEFF GOLDBLUM IMPRESSIONS.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.748
THEY WANT. . .IRONIC JUXTAPOSITION
OF RICK SPRINGFIELD LYRICS.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.611
- PLEASE DON'T SAY ANY OF THIS,
SHAWN.

26:31.650 --> 26:34.050
- I'M NOT SAYING IT.
I'M RAPPING IT.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.318
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

26:35.360 --> 26:37.180
JUST YESTERDAY I COULDN'T
SAY THE WORLD "DIED"

26:37.220 --> 26:38.619
WITHOUT YOU SHIVERING.

26:38.660 --> 26:39.649
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
DON'T EVER SAY THAT.

26:39.690 --> 26:42.898
SECONDLY, I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.228
DESPEREAUX IS ALIVE.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.726
- THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
- IT'S PERFECT.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.237
- I WATCHED HIM BLOW UP.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.760
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW HE DID IT, GUS.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.109
BUT HOWEVER HE DID IT,
THAT'S HOW HE DOES IT.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.778
IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING
FROM F/X AND F/X2,

26:53.810 --> 26:55.630
IT'S THAT ANYTHING
CAN BE FAKED...

26:55.680 --> 26:57.136
AND BRYAN BROWN
CANNOT CARRY A MOVIE.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.772
- WHAT ABOUT
FULL-BODY MASSAGE?

26:58.810 --> 27:00.346
- WE BOTH KNOW
WHY WE RENTED THAT.

27:00.380 --> 27:02.109
- SHAWN, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE STAYING IN REALITY.

27:02.150 --> 27:03.219
- TRUST ME, GUS.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.787
WHY DO YOU THINK HE WANTED ME
TO GIVE THE EULOGY?

27:05.820 --> 27:08.186
BECAUSE HE'S COMING.
- HE'S NOT GONNA BE HERE.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.051
- HE MOST CERTAINLY IS.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

27:10.090 --> 27:11.421
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I WOULD DO.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.825
HA.

27:12.860 --> 27:15.021
I AM GIVING THIS SPEECH
TO HIM.

27:15.060 --> 27:17.199
- DON'T YOU THINK YOUR TAKE
ON THIS IS A LITTLE EASY?

27:17.230 --> 27:18.788
- EASY?

27:18.830 --> 27:21.435
YES, BUT LIFE IS EASY, GUS.

27:21.470 --> 27:22.960
IF YOU REALLY WANT IT TO BE.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.072
DESPEREAUX IS HERE.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.202
HE'S IN OUR HEARTS.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.343
MAYBE IN THESE PLANTS.

27:35.380 --> 27:38.315
AND MAYBE BEHIND
THAT TREE OVER THERE.

27:38.350 --> 27:40.045
WHEREVER HE IS,
I JUST WANT HIM TO KNOW

27:40.090 --> 27:43.355
THAT WE CAN ALL
FEEL HIS PRESENCE,

27:43.390 --> 27:46.723
LISTENING TO EVERYTHING
WE'RE SAYING.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.297
AH, IT'S LIKE
MY DAD HERE ALWAYS SAYS,

27:49.330 --> 27:51.719
PLEASE, HELP ME
WITH MY PANTS,

27:51.770 --> 27:53.965
FOR I CAN NO LONGER
CONTROL MY BOWELS.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.297
- I DON'T SAY THAT.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.762
- COME ON UP HERE.
- I DON'T WANNA.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.438
- COME ON,
BRING ME MY ENVELOPE.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.779
IT'S GONNA CLEAR UP
ALL KINDS OF MYSTERIES.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.778
GIVE IT UP, LADIES.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.175
AND...THAT DUDE
IN THE THIRD ROW.

28:04.210 --> 28:05.700
HOW'D HE GET THE INVITE?

28:05.750 --> 28:07.206
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS GONNA BE ANY--

28:07.250 --> 28:08.478
MY DAD!

28:08.520 --> 28:10.169
MY DAD.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.745
HE'S ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG.

28:12.790 --> 28:15.918
- HE CRIED
AT BENJI: THE HUNTED.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.178
- IT'S BECAUSE
HE WAS BEING HUNTED.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.118
- HE'S AFRAID OF RACCOONS.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.459
- BECAUSE THEY'RE TERRIFYING
AND WEAR LITTLE MASKS.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.320
- THEY ARE.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.099
- THE GOLDEN GLOBE GOES TO...

28:27.130 --> 28:29.064
ANGELINA JOLIE...

28:29.100 --> 28:31.068
FOR THE TOURIST.
[laughs]

28:31.110 --> 28:32.839
JUST KIDDING.
WE ALL KNOW SHE DIDN'T WIN.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.076
SHE SHOULD'VE.

28:34.110 --> 28:36.328
- NOPE.
- SHE WAS ROBBED.

28:36.380 --> 28:37.972
[clears throat]

28:45.350 --> 28:47.147
THIS CAN'T--
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.756
HE'S DEAD.

28:52.790 --> 28:53.927
HE'S--

28:53.960 --> 28:56.099
UH...

28:56.130 --> 29:00.089
I'VE NEVER--I'VE NEVER LOST
ANYONE CLOSE TO ME BEFORE

29:00.130 --> 29:01.438
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

29:01.470 --> 29:04.837
UM...

29:04.870 --> 29:06.963
JESUS, HOW STUPID SAD
IS THIS?

29:07.010 --> 29:09.308
PEOPLE DIE.

29:09.340 --> 29:10.898
IT'S AWFUL.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.372
AND UNFAIR.

29:12.410 --> 29:15.447
AND--AND, OH, MY GOD,
GUS IS GONNA DIE.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.777
- I'M NOT GONNA DIE, SHAWN.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.981
- YOU ARE.
SOON.

29:19.020 --> 29:22.251
DEFINITELY BEFORE ME
IF STATISTICS PROVE CORRECT.

29:22.290 --> 29:25.487
WHICH IS SO WRONG, BECAUSE
I'M PRACTICALLY ASKING FOR IT.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.418
- PEOPLE ARE
GONNA MISS ME SO MUCH.

29:30.030 --> 29:32.123
- MY DAD SAID
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.139
I GUESS I WAS WRONG,
AND I SHOULD SAY THAT NOW

29:35.170 --> 29:38.537
BECAUSE GOD KNOWS YOUR MINUTES
ARE SEVERELY LIMITED.

29:38.570 --> 29:41.778
[sobs]

29:50.420 --> 29:53.014
- SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.280
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SHOCKED.

29:55.320 --> 29:59.950
- YEAH, YEAH,
AND SO UNNECESSARY.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.491
- OH, VICTIM OF FOUL PLAY.

30:01.530 --> 30:03.293
- GEE, I WONDER
WHO COULD HAVE DONE IT.

30:03.330 --> 30:04.888
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:04.930 --> 30:07.990
BUT I BET SHE KINDA LIKED
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE

30:08.040 --> 30:09.996
AS HE BLEW UP.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.167
NO ONE CROSSES ME.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.098
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING OF MINE.

30:14.140 --> 30:16.028
- DID I BORROW YOUR SOCKS?

30:16.080 --> 30:18.139
- WE SCOURED THE BOTTOM
OF THE LAKE AND THE WRECKAGE,

30:18.180 --> 30:19.442
AND IT WAS
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND,

30:19.480 --> 30:21.516
WHICH MEANS IT CAN
ONLY BE IN ONE PLACE.

30:21.550 --> 30:22.915
- DAVID LEE ROTH'S
BEACH HOUSE.

30:22.950 --> 30:24.019
- GIVE ME THE DAGGER.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.586
- I DON'T HAVE IT.
- REALLY?

30:25.620 --> 30:28.350
IT LOOKS A LITTLE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.449
DO YOU NEED
A CLOSER LOOK?

30:30.490 --> 30:33.050
- WHAT IS THIS, YOU SHOW ME
YOURS, I SHOW YOU MINE?

30:33.090 --> 30:35.456
- MAYBE.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.422
- HEY, SHAWN, YOU BACK HERE?

30:37.460 --> 30:39.098
OH, SHAWN,
THERE YOU ARE.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.222
- TALK TO YOU LATER.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.329
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:42.370 --> 30:44.463
- OH, CRAP.

30:44.510 --> 30:48.435
- SERIOUSLY, SPENCER,
WORST EULOGY EVER.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.436
IT WAS HILARIOUS,
PATHETIC AT THE SAME TIME

30:50.480 --> 30:51.640
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.341
- WHO WAS THAT?
- JACQUELINE MEDEIROS.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.347
- THE WOMAN WHO BROKE
INTO THE MUSEUM?

30:54.380 --> 30:55.472
- YES.
- AND SHE LIES.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.148
ARREST HER.
- YOU HAVE PROOF OF THIS?

30:58.190 --> 31:00.181
I GOTTA GO.

31:03.190 --> 31:04.589
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

31:04.630 --> 31:06.518
AND WHY DOES SHE THINK
WE HAVE THE DAGGER?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.448
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

31:08.500 --> 31:13.164
MAYBE...

31:13.200 --> 31:14.565
BECAUSE OF THIS.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.158
- YOU HAD THAT IN YOUR PANTS?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.031
- I SWIPED IT OFF DESPEREAUX
AT THE BUCKET

31:18.070 --> 31:20.004
BEFORE WE SPLIT OFF.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.507
- YOU'RE NOT GOING AFTER
THE CORE COLLECTION, ARE YOU?

31:21.540 --> 31:23.371
- NO. WE ARE.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.503
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE
DESPEREAUX DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.347
- OH, NO, WE'RE NOT.
GIVE ME THAT.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.517
I'M TAKING IT
TO THE POLICE.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.108
- NO WAY.
NO WAY.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.482
THAT DASTARDLY WOMAN KILLED
THE COOLEST MAN ON EARTH

31:32.520 --> 31:34.385
OVER THIS TREASURE,
AND I WILL NOT LET HER

31:34.420 --> 31:35.648
GET THERE FIRST, GUS.

31:35.690 --> 31:37.112
THERE IS NOTHING
IN THE WORLD

31:37.160 --> 31:38.457
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
GIVE THIS BACK.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.378
- I WILL SLUG YOU
IN THE FACE CARTILAGE, SHAWN.

31:40.430 --> 31:43.524
- HERE WE GO.
BACK TO THIS.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.290
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT, DO IT.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.228
I'M BEGGING YOU.

31:47.270 --> 31:50.194
I AM BEGGING YOU
TO GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.300
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.568
OW!

31:54.610 --> 31:56.578
THAT HURTS LIKE THE DICKENS.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.271
- WELL.

31:58.310 --> 31:59.675
- I WILL STRIKE YOU BACK.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.940
- I DARE YOU.
I DOUBLE DOG DARE YOU.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.585
I TRIPLE DOG DARE YOU.
AH!

32:04.620 --> 32:06.019
YOU WENT FROM LOW TO HIGH.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.312
- YOU WERE READY FOR THAT.

32:09.390 --> 32:10.948
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, GUS.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.480
YOU BROUGHT A FUNERAL PROGRAM
TO A KNIFE FIGHT.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.555
COME ON.
COME ON, BABY GIRL.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.693
- YOU WANT TO BUMBLE
WITH THE BEE, HUH?

32:16.730 --> 32:19.028
- BZZZ.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.162
WHAT'S THIS?
WHAT IS THAT?

32:20.200 --> 32:22.498
WHAT IS THAT?

32:22.540 --> 32:24.405
- [laughs]

32:24.440 --> 32:26.169
AH!

32:28.110 --> 32:30.476
[both grunting]

32:34.620 --> 32:36.178
CAMEL CLUTCH.
TAKE THAT.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.517
ASK HIM, REF.
ASK HIM.

32:37.550 --> 32:38.619
- [groaning]

32:41.120 --> 32:45.329
- DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.329
[both grunting]

32:48.360 --> 32:50.021
- AH, WHAT IS HAPPENING?

32:50.060 --> 32:51.425
- I DON'T KNOW!
AHH!

32:51.470 --> 32:53.995
- YOU BIT ME.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

32:56.370 --> 32:58.463
- WE ARE GOING
ON A TREASURE HUNT!

32:58.510 --> 33:00.239
- OH, NO, WE'RE NOT.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.501
[groaning]

33:08.250 --> 33:09.615
- DUDE, YOU BROKE IT.

33:09.650 --> 33:13.347
- YOU BROKE IT...
'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T LET IT GO.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.085
- WAIT A MINUTE.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.758
THIS BROKE OFF
WAY TOO CLEAN LY.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.587
ALMOST LIKE
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.758
- IT DIDN'T BREAK.
THAT PIECE IS A CAP.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.099
AND THIS ISN'T A DAGGER.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.302
- IT'S A KEY.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.174
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE CORE COLLECTION?

33:40.210 --> 33:42.417
- IT DOESN'T EXIST.
- WHAT IF IT DID?

33:42.450 --> 33:43.644
- BUT IT DOESN'T.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.740
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A KEY LIKE THIS?

33:46.790 --> 33:48.678
- YES.
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

33:48.720 --> 33:51.154
- UH, I DREW THAT.
- REALLY?

33:51.190 --> 33:53.454
YES, IT'S
A PRESSURE POINT KEY.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.219
IT DOESN'T TWIST.

33:55.260 --> 33:58.423
IT DISENGAGES THE LOCK
BY INSERTION.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.563
- NOW THAT'S A SEXY IDEA
FOR A KEY.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.137
- IT'S DESIGNED FOR A LOCK
THAT YOU CANNOT SEE

34:03.170 --> 34:04.535
DEEP INSIDE
SOMETHING ELSE.

34:04.570 --> 34:06.208
- LIKE IN A CAKE.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.161
- NO.

34:07.210 --> 34:11.499
MORE LIKE A SECRET WALL
INSIDE AN OLD SAFE.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.246
DO YOU HAVE MORE
OF THESE PICTURES?

34:14.280 --> 34:17.511
- UH, I'M NOT CLOTHED
IN MANY OF THESE.

34:17.550 --> 34:18.744
- THE KEY, BY THE WAY,

34:18.790 --> 34:21.111
WOULD BE ATTACHED
TO SOME SORT OF POST.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.310
- OR A DAGGER?
HYPOTHETICALLY.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.725
- HYPOTH ETICALLY, YES.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.125
- SO WOULD YOU SAY
THESE LOCKS WERE MADE

34:26.160 --> 34:29.493
AROUND, UM...

34:29.530 --> 34:31.589
- GET THERE.
- THE CIVIL WAR?

34:31.630 --> 34:33.325
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

34:33.370 --> 34:37.192
NO, I WOULD SAY
THAT WAS 19205.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.605
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A LOCK LIKE THAT BEFORE?

34:38.640 --> 34:41.529
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE, YES.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.774
AT MR. YERDEN'S ESTATE.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.471
THAT WAS BUILT
IN THE 19205.

34:44.510 --> 34:46.148
HAVE YOU EVER
TAKEN THE TOUR?

34:46.180 --> 34:48.319
- NO, WE HAVE NOT,
BUT WE WILL NOW.

34:48.350 --> 34:50.113
- GOOD. ENJOY.

34:50.150 --> 34:51.708
DON'T HURRY BACK.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.580
- THERE IS A LOCK BURIED
IN A WALL SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE

34:59.630 --> 35:01.848
WITH AN OPENING THAT MATCHES
THIS DAGGER PERFECT LY.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.299
- WILL YOU PUT THAT AWAY?

35:03.330 --> 35:04.820
- OH, STOP WORRYING.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.498
GONNA BLEND.
NOBODY'S GONNA--AH!

35:07.530 --> 35:11.364
AH--NOTICE US.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.365
- NO FOOD.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.502
- I DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD.

35:13.540 --> 35:15.599
- I SMELL IT.
[sniffs]

35:15.640 --> 35:19.144
- [sniffs]
CH EETOS.

35:19.180 --> 35:21.273
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
IT'S JUST A SNACK.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.641
AND A BAG OF FRUIT PUNCH.
BUT DON'T WORRY, IT WON'T SPILL.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.581
- NO FOOD!
DRINKS...SMOKING.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.611
[whispering] FLASH PICTURES.
[louder] HEELED SHOES.

35:28.660 --> 35:32.255
HAND LOTIONS.
OFFENSIVE COLOGN ES.

35:32.290 --> 35:35.521
MINNESOTANS.
TATTOOS WITH WOLVES.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.198
EXPOSED LIPOSUCT ION SCARS.

35:37.230 --> 35:39.892
LAPBANDS.
HAIR EXTENSIONS, LOUD NOISES.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.932
SURPRISING GESTURES.

35:41.970 --> 35:45.303
BODILY. . . FLUIDS.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.535
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LOSE THE CHEETOS.

35:47.570 --> 35:49.800
- I'VE ALREADY
DISPOSED OF THEM.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.400
- [pats down pockets]

35:52.450 --> 35:55.214
- I DO NOT REPEAT,
SO YOU MUST LISTEN.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.444
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF,

35:56.480 --> 35:58.812
THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS A DUMB QUESTION.

35:58.850 --> 36:01.683
I'LL ASSUME MANY OF YOU
HAVE COMPLETED THE THIRD GRADE.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.382
IF AT ANY TIME YOU'RE CONFUSED
BY SOMETHING THAT YOU HEAR,

36:04.430 --> 36:06.921
RIGHT, THERE'S A BOOK
IN THE GIFT SHOP TO HELP YOU.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.929
IT'S CALLED THE DICTIONARY.
OPEN IT UP ONCE IN A WHILE.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.564
NOW WHO'S READY TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.761
TRY AND KEEP YOUR LOWER LIP
FROM DROPPING TO YOUR WAIST

36:13.800 --> 36:16.564
DURING THE PARTS
WITH MULTIPLE SYLLABLES.

36:22.910 --> 36:24.673
MR. YERDEN SPENT
THE BULK OF HIS LIFE

36:24.710 --> 36:27.440
ACQUIRING THE RARE WORKS OF ART
AND PRICELESS ARTIFACT S

36:27.480 --> 36:30.449
THAT YOU SEE--
BUT DO NOT TOUCH--HERE.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.711
MR. YERDEN ALSO DABBLED
IN PAINTING HIMSELF,

36:33.750 --> 36:35.854
BUT WE WERE NEVER FORTUNATE
ENOUGH TO SEE HIS WORKS

36:35.890 --> 36:37.983
AS HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF.

36:38.020 --> 36:40.580
DO YOU NEED FLASH CARDS?
LET'S GO.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.689
LET'S GO.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.597
- DAMN IT.

36:47.630 --> 36:49.894
- THE GRANITE IN EACH HANDLE
ON THE ESTATE

36:49.940 --> 36:51.737
COMES FROM A QUARRY
ON THE SAME SITE

36:51.770 --> 36:54.477
AS ONE OF MR. YERDEN'S
GREATEST DISCOVERIES.

36:54.510 --> 36:56.603
EVEN HIS CRYPT,
RIGHT HERE ON THE GROUNDS,

36:56.640 --> 36:58.369
IS MADE OF THE MATERIAL.

36:58.410 --> 37:00.549
- UH, UH.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.878
OH, WHAT ARE, UH...

37:02.920 --> 37:04.512
PILLOWS?

37:04.550 --> 37:06.939
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A QUESTION AS WELL.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.287
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

37:08.320 --> 37:11.619
- I MEAN,
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS:

37:11.660 --> 37:15.289
WHAT MADE MR. YERDEN CHOOSE
THESE PARTICULAR PILLOWS?

37:16.700 --> 37:21.330
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANNA ASK
AN UNANSWERABLE QUESTION,

37:21.370 --> 37:24.760
ASK YOURSELF WHY YOU CHOSE
TO WEAR THAT SHIRT.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.732
NOW...IS THE DUM-DUM SHOW OVER

37:26.770 --> 37:29.773
SO WE CAN GET
TO BIG FOLKS TALK?

37:29.810 --> 37:32.301
REALLY?

37:32.350 --> 37:34.511
- CAN WE GET OUTTA HERE?
I'M EXHAUSTED.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.370
YOU STABBED EVERYTHING
IN THIS MAN'S HOUSE.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.910
- I DON'T GET IT, GUS.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.508
MAYBE THE KEY
FITS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

37:39.550 --> 37:40.915
- MAYBE THE KEY FITS NOTHING.

37:40.950 --> 37:43.054
MAYBE IT WAS ALL
AN INVENTION.

37:43.090 --> 37:44.523
IF I'VE LEARNED NOTHING
FROM THIS TOUR,

37:44.560 --> 37:46.983
IT'S THAT YERDEN
WAS AN EGOMANIAC.

37:47.030 --> 37:49.897
I'LL BET HE'S LAUGHING IN HIS
GRANITE-COATED CRYPT RIGHT NOW.

37:49.930 --> 37:51.966
WHAT?

38:10.120 --> 38:12.042
- GUS.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.698
THIS IS IT.

38:26.730 --> 38:27.958
- WHAT, THE SWITCH
TO THE WATER FOUNTAIN?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.558
- NO, NO, NO,
I HEARD SOMETHING.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.999
THE GROUND RUMBLED.
THIS IS IT.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.564
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU HEARD, SHAWN.

38:32.610 --> 38:33.838
STOP IT.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.974
- [screams]

38:37.140 --> 38:38.573
- HEY.

38:38.610 --> 38:39.838
- BANNED FOR LIFE.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.916
DID THEY REALLY HAVE TO
FINGERPRINT US FOR THAT?

38:46.890 --> 38:50.087
CH EETOS.

38:52.430 --> 38:53.852
- I KNOW WHAT
THAT KEY OPENED.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.719
WOW.

39:00.770 --> 39:05.537
THAT SLY OLD BASTARD.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.959
DUDE, THERE'S A CENTIPEDE
ON YOUR SHIRT.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.071
GUS.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.543
THIS IS IT.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.751
WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO OPEN IT.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.417
- THIS IS A TRAP, SHAWN.

39:23.460 --> 39:24.825
YOU PUSH THE WRONG THING,

39:24.860 --> 39:27.124
AND A GIANT ROCK
COMES SPINNING THROUGH HERE

39:27.160 --> 39:28.696
OR SPIKES COME
OUT OF THE CEILING,

39:28.730 --> 39:29.992
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

39:30.030 --> 39:31.861
I'M THE SKELETON
LOCKED IN A PERPETUAL SCREAM

39:31.900 --> 39:34.027
THAT'S MEANT TO SCARE
SOME DUDE 100 YEARS LATER

39:34.070 --> 39:35.594
FOR THE JOKE.

39:35.640 --> 39:40.031
MY SKELETON IS NOT GONNA
BE A PUNCH LINE, SHAWN.

39:40.070 --> 39:41.469
- I'VE WORKED WITH
PROFESSIONALS,

39:41.510 --> 39:44.172
MERCENARI ES,
COMPROMISED DOUBLE AGENTS,

39:44.210 --> 39:45.905
AND YET NO ONE'S BEHAVIOR

39:45.950 --> 39:48.510
HAS BEEN AS UTTERLY
CONFUSING AS YOURS.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.017
- THANK YOU.

39:50.050 --> 39:51.176
- IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.040
- WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR
DEFINITION OF "CONFUSING,"

39:53.090 --> 39:54.284
DOESN'T IT?

39:54.320 --> 39:56.459
- I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE
SEARCHING FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE,

39:56.490 --> 39:58.526
AND YET SOMEHOW YOU'VE BEEN
ONE STEP AHEAD OF ME

39:58.560 --> 39:59.788
AT ALL TIMES.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.151
- JACKIE, I TOLD YOU,
I'M SPOKEN FOR.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.155
- HA.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.497
- THOUGH I DO HAVE
A SKILL SET

40:04.530 --> 40:06.168
THAT REACHES
WELL BEYOND THE NORMAL.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.758
- GREAT.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.665
THEN YOU CAN OPEN THAT.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.669
- MMM...

40:12.710 --> 40:16.168
SEE, THERE'S SIX AND, UH...

40:16.210 --> 40:17.802
- DON'T DO IT, SHAWN.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.502
- I DON'T THINK HE HAS
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.017
- SHE JUST GOT SO SERIOUS.

40:27.490 --> 40:29.811
LEVERS.

40:29.860 --> 40:32.624
WHY DID IT HAVE
TO BE LEVERS?

40:39.170 --> 40:41.491
- OPEN IT.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.146
[rumbling]

41:01.960 --> 41:04.212
- "LOOK BEHIND YOU."

41:09.030 --> 41:11.191
- DON'T YOU JUST HATE
PEOPLE WHO KILL YOU?

41:16.600 --> 41:17.737
- I MEAN, REALLY,

41:17.770 --> 41:20.102
THE AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION
THIS WOMAN GOT

41:20.140 --> 41:22.108
FROM WHAT LEGITIMATELY
AMOUNTS TO MURDER

41:22.140 --> 41:23.505
IS MIND-BOGGLING.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.007
OH, SURE,
WE WERE STEALING THE KEY

41:25.050 --> 41:26.938
TO PRICELESS ARTIFACT S
FROM HER,

41:26.980 --> 41:29.813
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENJOY IT
IS ALL I'M SAYING.

41:29.850 --> 41:32.182
- I AM SO HAPPY
THAT YOU ARE ALIVE.

41:32.220 --> 41:33.949
- OH, THANK YOU.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

41:33.990 --> 41:36.982
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

41:37.020 --> 41:39.659
OH, NEVER MIND,
YOU'RE SO FRICKIN' AWESOME.

41:39.690 --> 41:42.124
HOW DID YOU DO IT?
- HOW DID I GET IN HERE?

41:42.160 --> 41:44.822
WELL, YOU OPENED THE WAY,
SHAWN.

41:44.870 --> 41:47.020
NICE CALL WITH THE FOUNTAIN
BY THE WAY.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.867
I'D HAVE GUESSED THE STONE LIONS
IN THE LIBRARY,

41:48.900 --> 41:51.232
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'M A TRADITIONALIST.

41:51.270 --> 41:53.738
- NO, YOU SILLY BOTTOM.

41:53.770 --> 41:55.579
HOW ARE YOU ALIVE?

41:55.610 --> 41:57.999
- I HAD A PERFECT LY GOOD
MEDICAL SCHOOL BODY ON ICE.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.803
AND I'D ALREADY COME UP
WITH AN EXIT PLAN

41:59.850 --> 42:02.114
WHEN YOU'D CALLED
WITH A MUCH BETTER IDEA.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.141
HELLO.
HELLO, SHAWN.

42:04.180 --> 42:06.239
WELL,
NOTHING TOO IMPORTANT.

42:06.290 --> 42:09.657
I'M ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE
OF CUTTING MY HAIR.

42:09.690 --> 42:12.853
I LOCATED YOUR WATCH
SIGNAL INSTANTLY.

42:12.890 --> 42:15.552
I JUST NEEDED MORE TIME
TO SET THINGS UP.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.591
THIS WILL TAKE
A FEW HOURS.

42:17.630 --> 42:19.860
I CHANGED A PLANNED
FISHING ACCIDENT

42:19.900 --> 42:20.798
INTO A BOAT ESCAPE.

42:20.830 --> 42:23.037
I JUST NEEDED TO LOSE YOU
ALONG THE WAY.

42:23.070 --> 42:24.264
- SO THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A SETUP

42:24.300 --> 42:25.858
FROM THE MOMENT
WE REACHED THE FACTORY?

42:25.910 --> 42:26.808
- MM-HMM.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.603
- OOH, HOW DID YOU GET
THE DNA TO MATCH?

42:28.640 --> 42:30.107
- NOW THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

42:30.140 --> 42:33.598
I NEEDED IRREFUTABLE PROOF
THAT I WAS DEAD.

42:33.650 --> 42:35.277
AND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
TO LEAVE A LARGE ENOUGH SAMPLE

42:35.320 --> 42:38.016
WITHOUT LOSING A HAND
OR A BODY PART.

42:38.050 --> 42:40.189
AND I'D SEEN 127 HOURS,

42:40.220 --> 42:43.018
AND, WELL, UGH.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.324
SO I SIMPLY DID
THE NEXT BEST THING.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.248
I CHANGED MY DNA
IN THE DATABASE

42:47.290 --> 42:49.622
TO JOHN DOE NUMBER 12.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.764
OF COURSE IT WAS GONNA MATCH.
IT'S HIM.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.893
- YOU CAN HACK TOO.
- I HAVE A GUY.

42:53.930 --> 42:55.898
- CAN YOU INTRODUCE HIM TO US?
- OF COURSE.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.363
- GUYS.
- BUT THEN AGAIN,

42:58.400 --> 43:00.960
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO SWIPE THE DAGGER FROM ME

43:01.010 --> 43:02.637
IN THE FACTORY.
THAT WAS A CLASS LIFT.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.931
I'VE NOTHING LEFT
TO TEACH YOU.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.817
- WHERE IS IT?

43:11.850 --> 43:15.308
- LET'S OPEN IT TOGETHER.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.022
- OH.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.197
- IT'S A GENIE.

43:25.230 --> 43:27.664
- IT'S NOT A GENIE.

43:27.700 --> 43:30.362
- GUS, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
GENIES COME IN LAMPS.

43:35.710 --> 43:36.870
YOU DO IT.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.180
- HIS ASHES?

43:45.220 --> 43:46.881
- ALL THIS WAY FOR THAT?

43:46.920 --> 43:49.218
THAT CAN'T BE.
IT'S HIS LEGACY.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.216
- EVEN HIS CRYPT
RIGHT HERE ON THE GROUNDS

43:51.260 --> 43:53.319
IS MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.689
- IF HIS ASHES
ARE IN THE URN,

43:57.730 --> 44:00.198
WHAT'S IN THE CRYPT?

44:00.230 --> 44:04.337
- THE STUDENT HAS BECOME
THE MASTER.

44:06.410 --> 44:09.038
LET'S GO.

44:16.750 --> 44:17.978
- YOU'RE DOING A BANG-UP JOB

44:18.020 --> 44:19.749
DESECRATING THIS GUY'S
FINAL RESTING PLACE.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.985
- GUS, HIS ASHES
WERE IN THE URN.

44:22.020 --> 44:23.248
THEY WERE A CLUE.

44:23.290 --> 44:25.258
IN THE END,
HE WANTED US TO DO THIS.

44:25.290 --> 44:26.780
- NO.

44:26.830 --> 44:28.718
- AGH!

44:36.300 --> 44:38.188
- YOU'RE NOT...

44:38.240 --> 44:40.037
YOU'RE NOT CRYING,
ARE YOU?

44:40.070 --> 44:43.039
- WELL...I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST--

44:43.080 --> 44:45.776
THIS GUY'S NEVER GONNA SEE
HIS DOG TARTOOF AGAIN.

44:45.810 --> 44:46.970
- HIS DOG'S NAME WAS TARTOOF?

44:47.010 --> 44:49.979
- PROBABLY.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.443
- WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY,
SHAWN.

44:52.490 --> 44:55.209
WHAT YOU SAID AT MY FUNERAL...
MADE ME MIST UP AS WELL.

44:55.260 --> 44:56.284
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.185
REALLY MOVING.
- YOU WERE THERE?

44:58.220 --> 45:00.154
- OF COURSE,
I WAS IN THE COFFIN.

45:00.190 --> 45:01.896
- OH! I WAS GONNA CHECK THERE.

45:01.930 --> 45:03.124
- THAT WOULD'VE BEEN WEIRD.
- GUYS.

45:03.160 --> 45:06.027
CAN WE DO THIS?

45:17.210 --> 45:18.973
- IT'S GOTTA BE REMBRANDT'S
UNFINISHED PORTRAIT

45:19.010 --> 45:20.307
OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.443
IT WAS RUMORED
YERDEN HAD IT FOR YEARS.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.948
- OR PERHAPS
IT'S A THOMAS KINCAID.

45:24.990 --> 45:26.912
- SHAWN, YOU REALLY NEED
TO LEARN ANOTHER PAINTER.

45:26.950 --> 45:30.181
- YEAH, LIKE THAT'S EVER
GONNA BE NECESSARY.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.205
IT'S BREATHTAKING.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.332
- IT'S CRAPPY.

45:47.370 --> 45:48.803
- YOU'RE CRAPPY.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.000
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.974
HE'S GOING FOR FRUIT.
IT LOOKS LIKE FRUIT.

45:52.010 --> 45:54.877
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

45:54.920 --> 45:57.946
I MEAN,
HE CREATED THIS HUNT,

45:57.980 --> 45:59.982
LEFT ALL THESE CLUES, LEAKED
THE RUMOR OF THIS COLLECTION,

46:00.020 --> 46:03.080
AND ALL FOR--FOR THIS?

46:05.130 --> 46:07.826
- MR. YERDEN ALSO DABBLED
IN PAINTING HIMSELF.

46:07.860 --> 46:10.090
BUT WE WERE NEVER FORTUNATE
ENOUGH TO SEE HIS WORKS

46:10.130 --> 46:11.893
SINCE HE KEPT THEM
TO HIMSELF.

46:11.930 --> 46:13.363
- THEY'RE HIS.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.492
- WHAT?

46:14.530 --> 46:16.031
- OH.

46:16.070 --> 46:19.267
HARRISON YERDEN
PAINTED THOSE HIMSELF.

46:19.310 --> 46:22.438
THESE ARE HIS
MOST CHERISHED POSSESSIONS.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.232
- UH, I BEG TO DIFFER.

46:24.280 --> 46:25.975
- THINK ABOUT IT, FELLAS.

46:26.010 --> 46:27.443
THIS MAN TRAVELED
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH,

46:27.480 --> 46:29.846
RISKING EVERYTHING
TO FIND BEAUTIFUL THINGS

46:29.880 --> 46:31.245
MADE BY OTHERS.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.145
BUT THE ONE
UNATTAINABLE GOAL

46:33.190 --> 46:35.112
THAT HE WOULD NEVER ACHIEVE

46:35.160 --> 46:38.254
WAS TO BE THE OBJECT
OF ONE OF THOSE SEARCHES.

46:38.290 --> 46:40.326
TO HAVE SOMEONE GO
ON A QUEST LIKE OURS

46:40.360 --> 46:41.850
FOR HIS WORKS.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.095
TO BE THE PRIZE
AT THE END OF A JOURNEY.

46:44.130 --> 46:45.859
- PERFECT.
- HE'S NARCISSISTIC.

46:45.900 --> 46:47.322
- IN_THE BIGGEST_WAY.
[Sirens approaching]

46:47.370 --> 46:48.837
- I LIKE THE ONE
WITH THE CAT.

46:48.870 --> 46:50.861
- STILL CRAPPY.
- GUS IS CRAPPY.

46:50.900 --> 46:52.936
- YOUR MAMA'S CRAPPY.
- YOU'RE JUST PLAIN CRAPOLA.

46:52.970 --> 46:54.062
- SUCK IT, SHAWN.

46:54.110 --> 46:55.600
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE

46:55.640 --> 46:58.177
BEFORE WE ALL GET ARRESTED.

47:12.490 --> 47:16.859
- I'M NEVER GONNA
SEE YOU AGAIN, AM I?

47:16.900 --> 47:18.527
- IF YOU'D LIKE
TO PLAN A VACATION

47:18.560 --> 47:20.619
TO SOME FRIENDLY,
NON-EXTRADITING COUNTRY,

47:20.670 --> 47:22.934
I'D BE HAPPY TO SET UP
A WEEKEND FOR YOU.

47:22.970 --> 47:26.098
- IT HURTS.
IT'S REAL.

47:26.140 --> 47:28.529
I GET THAT NOW.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.606
- WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
THAT 1.6 MILLION, ARE WE?

47:32.650 --> 47:33.708
- WHEN THE COURTS RELEASE IT,

47:33.750 --> 47:36.139
IT WILL GO INTO YOUR ACCOUNT
FOR ABOUT NINE MINUTES,

47:36.180 --> 47:38.341
AND THEN IT WILL
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR.

47:38.380 --> 47:39.938
DON'T TRY TO STOP IT.

47:39.990 --> 47:41.958
- WE WON'T ACCEPT IT.
- OH, YES, WE WILL.

47:41.990 --> 47:43.480
- WHAT ABOUT THE TAXES?

47:43.520 --> 47:45.488
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES
ON MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE.

47:45.530 --> 47:47.589
- WHERE DO YOU GET
YOUR INFORMATION FROM, SHAWN?

47:47.630 --> 47:49.621
- GUS, DON'T BE LAO CHE.
- WHO?

47:49.660 --> 47:51.491
- THE DUDE FROM TEMPLE OF DOOM.
- WHAT?

47:51.530 --> 47:52.724
- REMEMBER, THEY GOT
ON HIS PLANE IN SHANGHAI

47:52.770 --> 47:54.931
AND FLEW ALL THE WAY TO INDIA
BEFORE THE PILOTS JUMPED OUT

47:54.970 --> 47:56.232
WHEN CLEARLY THEY COULD HAVE
JUST NOT TAKEN OFF

47:56.270 --> 47:57.191
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.593
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

47:58.640 --> 48:01.268
- WHAT?

48:04.110 --> 48:06.249
- WELL, I'LL BE.

48:13.020 --> 48:15.659
HEY, TEAM.

48:15.690 --> 48:17.385
I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

48:17.420 --> 48:19.524
FOR THE SCENE THAT
I CAUSED AT THE FUNERAL.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.255
I KNOW I'VE PROBABLY SEEMED
A LITTLE CRAZY

48:21.290 --> 48:23.292
THESE LAST FEW DAYS.

48:23.330 --> 48:25.321
- COME ON, SPENCER,
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

48:25.370 --> 48:28.931
I MEAN, THANKS TO YOU
ANOTHER CRIMINAL IS DEAD.

48:28.970 --> 48:30.995
IN MY BOOK, YOU CAN HOLD
YOUR HEAD UP HIGH AROUND HERE.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.507
- YOU EVEN FOUND
THE FIVE PAINTINGS

48:32.540 --> 48:34.303
OF THE CORE COLLECTION
IN YERDEN'S CRYPT.

48:34.340 --> 48:36.706
- THIS IS TRUE.
WAIT, WHAT?

48:36.740 --> 48:38.674
- THE WILD GOOSE CHASE THAT
RICH NUTBAG SENT US ON.

48:38.710 --> 48:40.143
WE FOUND ALL FIVE PAINTINGS.

48:40.180 --> 48:42.512
- THERE WERE SIX PAINTINGS.
- SIX?

48:42.550 --> 48:45.644
ARE YOU TELLING ME SOMEONE
STOLE ONE OF THOSE HEAPS?

48:45.690 --> 48:47.612
- NO.

48:47.650 --> 48:50.949
THAT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

48:50.990 --> 48:54.084
[dramatic music]

48:54.130 --> 49:02.139
*

49:23.090 --> 49:28.448
- HELLO, REMBRAN DT.
