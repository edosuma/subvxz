WEBVTT

00:06.120 --> 00:10.800
FOR GERD

00:14.880 --> 00:19.520
MATCHDAY 29 / APRIL 17, 2021
VFL WOLFSBURG 2 - FC BAYERN 3

00:22.600 --> 00:23.800
Bravo!

00:27.000 --> 00:28.880
Thanks, man!

00:39.800 --> 00:41.280
Okay, guys …

00:42.080 --> 00:43.200
Johnny.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.280
Men, men! Once again …

00:50.160 --> 00:53.480
hats off to your performance
and to your mindset.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.240
I know

00:56.040 --> 00:58.120
your adrenaline levels are up to here,

00:58.480 --> 01:01.320
and it's been
one of these days for me too.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.880
I knew it was going to be close today,
because they had a good team.

01:06.480 --> 01:11.960
It was great, although it got a little
hairy at the end. But I won't go there.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.360
It's just good to have won 3-2.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.040
Guys, I have something to say to you.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.560
I think we have a great connection here,
a very close connection.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.760
To me it's …

01:31.400 --> 01:36.040
a real joy to work with you.
You have an attitude

01:36.400 --> 01:39.280
that I haven't found anywhere else.
But …

01:39.920 --> 01:42.840
How can I say this?
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.400
I think it's just very important
that you hear it from me.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.680
What is FC Bayern?

02:28.600 --> 02:32.600
The first that springs to mind is myth,

02:35.680 --> 02:36.760
fascination,

02:39.040 --> 02:41.680
very, very strong personalities,

02:44.960 --> 02:46.080
legends!

02:46.440 --> 02:47.840
Gerd Müller scores!

02:49.040 --> 02:53.120
And of course
FC Bayern Munich itself is a legend.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.320
Right now it's a very lonely legend.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.680
Its very essence is missing, the fans.

03:08.720 --> 03:12.080
FC Bayern differs from other clubs
in that it is managed

03:12.440 --> 03:14.480
by former players.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.720
Franz Beckenbauer

03:17.080 --> 03:20.160
and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge
were very successful together.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.440
Uli Hoeneß
practically invented FC Bayern Munich.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.280
That's the reason that to us
this club is a matter of the heart.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.040
And sometimes
we take things too personally.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.440
Sometimes emotions run high,

03:41.880 --> 03:46.600
but you just do whatever's needed
in order for the team and the club

03:46.960 --> 03:49.240
to be and remain successful.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.920
Differences
are part and parcel of a real family.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.240
But to find solutions anyway,

03:55.600 --> 04:00.920
that is the essence
of the family feeling at FC Bayern.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.880
FC Bayern
was a dream come true for me too.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.120
But sometimes this dream
turned into a nightmare.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.760
The brutality of losing a final
in the last few minutes

04:30.120 --> 04:33.960
makes you wonder whether the soccer god
may be something of a sadist.

04:40.640 --> 04:45.520
When things go well, it's easy to face
the cameras, but when things get tough,

04:46.040 --> 04:50.200
that's when you have to step up.
FC Bayern always excelled at that.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.840
It's where we get
this enormous strength.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.840
While others struggle with defeats,
they make us stronger.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.480
Kahn! Bayern!

05:02.560 --> 05:04.280
Bayern wins!

05:07.720 --> 05:09.800
Robben … Robben!

05:10.320 --> 05:12.440
Unbelievable, Robben!

05:21.600 --> 05:23.360
And the crazy thing is,

05:23.800 --> 05:28.480
even with all these past successes,
and all these legends,

05:30.600 --> 05:35.320
today's team could yet become
the most successful of them all.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.560
If these guys win in Doha,
they will have played

05:39.920 --> 05:42.840
the most successful season ever.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.080
And that's crazy.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.200
6 DAYS BEFORE FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP
TRAINING GROUND SÄBENER STRASSE

05:58.560 --> 06:00.680
Field 1 is off-limits.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.680
Faster! Go, go, go!

06:10.240 --> 06:11.640
Apart from professionalism

06:12.080 --> 06:16.160
and everything that's part of soccer
nowadays, what's most important

06:16.520 --> 06:18.320
is that the guys stay cool.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.840
I'm out of here, man.
- Just go.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.080
No need to shower, you stink anyway.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.440
So where's your shampoo?
- I'll swipe some.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.480
Look! Check out what's in there!
- What about you? - What about me?

06:39.840 --> 06:43.240
You hoarder! What's all that stuff?
- Care products!

06:43.600 --> 06:46.200
Doping, more like! Look!
- Here, perfume.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.720
I've got that too.
- Never heard of that, right?

06:50.080 --> 06:53.280
So where's your shampoo?
- It's right here.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.760
No, that's not shampoo.
- Sure.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.120
If I catch you …
- Me?

06:59.480 --> 07:02.480
He usually goes through your locker.
- I don't steal! - Soon as your gone,

07:02.840 --> 07:06.960
he's in there.
- Me or you? - I pinch from Bouna.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.560
That's it. I'm out of here.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.840
What's for dinner?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.040
Nothing special.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.920
EXECUTIVE FLOOR - SÄBENER STRASSE

07:25.280 --> 07:27.120
Just to stick to the rules …

07:29.280 --> 07:31.440
Stay up to date, yeah.
- Easy.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.520
Just think, you have dropping revenues,
but still you have to …

07:35.880 --> 07:38.520
which is only right, by the way …

07:38.880 --> 07:43.680
You have to adjust the salaries
of your top players.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.680
Upwards.
- Yes, exactly. Leon, Jo

07:47.040 --> 07:50.440
and Serge are all somewhere between …

07:51.120 --> 07:53.160
yes, between 25 and 26 years old.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.200
So effectively …
- The best age.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.880
A raise of 50 percent. At least.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.040
Ouch!

08:01.480 --> 08:06.600
Our revenues won't be going up over
the next few years. On the contrary.

08:07.040 --> 08:07.960
Especially now.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.800
Well, that's what you're here for,
to bring in some money. - I know.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.200
It just shows you

08:14.920 --> 08:17.640
how perverse this business is.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.880
You could only do something like that
if you're completely irrational.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.120
Squaring the circle.
- But that's soccer for you.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.600
MUNICH-GIESING

08:42.440 --> 08:45.440
I loved this place from the start.
For me, it was all about

08:45.800 --> 08:47.600
getting a feel for Munich,

08:47.960 --> 08:52.040
to know what city you live in. I don't
think that's possible in Grünwald.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.040
Congratulations on winning the title!
- Not yet, not yet. - Oh, come on!

09:01.080 --> 09:03.880
I joined Bochum when I was seven,
and one or two years later

09:04.240 --> 09:06.280
I played the big championships.

09:06.920 --> 09:11.160
I've known Serge, Jo and Nicki
since that time.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.120
I've known Leon longest of all.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.200
We went to school together,
played in the school team.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.560
I played against Leroy when he still
played for Schalke, and I knew him well.

09:31.920 --> 09:37.280
So I know he was a guy who needed
clear messages. Sort of like me.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.960
I met Nicki when I was 13,

09:40.520 --> 09:42.680
or 14, and Leon a little later.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.960
My connection with Serge
was even more intimate.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.080
We met when we were twelve,

09:49.440 --> 09:53.080
at a tournament at VfB Stuttgart.
I was still a guest player.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.160
Hi, I'm Joshua Kimmich. I play for
VfB Stuttgart. This is my third season.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.880
My personal goal for this year
is to improve myself.

10:03.080 --> 10:08.160
It's just crazy. If you look at our
individual careers … Apart from Leroy

10:08.520 --> 10:10.720
we all played
for the national youth teams.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.960
And each of us went our own way.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.960
I went from Bochum to Schalke
and ended up with Bayern.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.680
Nicki came from Hoffenheim,
and Serge took

10:23.040 --> 10:26.040
a completely different path.
He played for several teams in England.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.560
Many thought he was going nowhere.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.760
Then he did incredible things
at the Olympics.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.440
Jo went from the 3rd division to the 2nd
and then came to Bayern. A big step!

10:36.800 --> 10:39.120
He was always
ambitious and great with the ball,

10:39.480 --> 10:41.960
but he was the one among us
I least expected to get this far.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.560
People kept saying, "You're too small,
too slow and too physically weak."

10:46.920 --> 10:47.960
But I think

10:49.320 --> 10:54.480
that my iron will, my mindset
and discipline got me to where I am now.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.040
He was always a bit mental.
Always bitching about,

10:58.400 --> 11:00.720
if things didn't go his way.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.680
He has a way of galvanizing others,

11:09.040 --> 11:11.960
which he's really good at,
but sometimes he goes overboard.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.800
That's a fact.

11:14.160 --> 11:19.200
He was very emotional even back then,
and he always had an iron will to win.

11:19.560 --> 11:24.880
He just couldn't accept defeat.
So he used to break down in tears.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.880
When I was a kid

11:27.240 --> 11:29.280
I did cry sometimes.

11:29.640 --> 11:33.640
I couldn't handle the emotions
racing through me all that well yet.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.160
The tears he spilt back then
are under control now, I think.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.720
It was very special for us
to meet here again.

11:44.080 --> 11:49.160
It's one thing to run for a team mate,
but it's different if he's a friend

11:49.520 --> 11:53.440
with whom you have a connection,
and whom you can rely on.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.080
Growing up together, playing soccer,

11:57.440 --> 11:59.600
is a wonderful thing.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.680
You can't plan a thing like that.
It's not like we said,

12:04.040 --> 12:08.560
"Wouldn't it be great to play for Bayern
together and win the Champions League?"

12:09.360 --> 12:10.680
And now

12:11.040 --> 12:16.320
we face the challenge of shaping our own
era at Bayern, and that is something!

12:23.800 --> 12:27.240
5 DAYS BEFORE FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP
CLUB GROUNDS SÄBENER STRASSE

12:29.680 --> 12:32.160
At last, another test!

12:32.520 --> 12:35.560
It's been ages since I had a test.
- That's nice, isn't it?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.360
Morning.
- Hi there. - Hello.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.240
Right or left?
- I can do it myself. - Yes? Okay.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.680
We did thousands of tests this season.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.120
On match days, training days …

13:06.560 --> 13:08.400
And we went well beyond the scope

13:08.760 --> 13:11.000
of the German Football League's concept,

13:11.920 --> 13:13.160
just to make sure

13:13.520 --> 13:16.040
that no one was infectious

13:16.400 --> 13:18.800
during training or on match days.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.440
Say Ah.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.320
The players and coaches
are also part of society and have a life

13:29.680 --> 13:32.120
outside the soccer stadium,
so they could still

13:32.560 --> 13:37.520
get infected, despite all the safety
measures. No club can protect itself

13:37.880 --> 13:43.080
from COVID-19 completely.
We have to get through this together.

13:49.160 --> 13:53.720
Hey, Brazzo, best stay here. We got
a report yesterday … - I better go.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.280
Then go.

13:55.640 --> 14:00.600
We got a report from the Munich
Health Department, stating

14:00.960 --> 14:04.840
they require us to apply
for an special permit …

14:05.200 --> 14:08.680
One thing's for certain, if we can't
get the permit beforehand,

14:09.040 --> 14:11.880
we can't have Lewandowski …
- Right. I spoke to Roland this morning,

14:12.240 --> 14:15.880
because this flip-flopping is no good.
I won't write to them … - To whom?

14:16.240 --> 14:19.520
I spoke to Roland,
and I'll give them a call. - Let's go.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.720
The meeting is starting.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.400
Mamma mia!

14:26.680 --> 14:28.800
Welcome to my life.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.400
It was time for our meeting.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.680
So you drop everything you're doing,
because that's how

14:38.040 --> 14:42.560
a soccer team works.
So then I sit here by myself … Still,

14:42.920 --> 14:47.440
you just have to step back,
because it's all about the squad,

14:47.800 --> 14:51.080
and once the meeting's over
I can carry on with my stuff.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.880
Leroy, hi, good morning.

14:56.640 --> 15:00.720
Basically it's my job to create
perfect working conditions

15:01.080 --> 15:02.920
for everyone on the team.

15:03.280 --> 15:07.600
And of course I have to reconcile
the club's economic interests

15:07.960 --> 15:11.920
and the squad's sporting interests
in some way.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.000
She's the best.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.960
She's really awesome.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.080
Not just for me, for all of us.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.040
All of us. Just imagine …

15:26.960 --> 15:29.600
23 jokers! Seriously.

15:31.040 --> 15:35.000
You write her a text on WhatsApp,
and she remembers everything!

15:35.360 --> 15:37.840
She's sort of like …

15:38.200 --> 15:41.800
a mom or a big sister.
But she's definitely also

15:42.160 --> 15:48.040
someone I can discuss serious things
with, or very private things.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.160
She's really, really good
at what she does.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.240
I've been doing this
for one and a half weeks now,

16:00.600 --> 16:05.520
and I scored in almost every match,
so I'll keep doing it, of course.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.200
I've always said,

16:09.640 --> 16:12.960
when they allow cameras
in the dressing room, I quit.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.680
But I'm having so much fun
playing soccer just now.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.960
Put down one foot, take a step
and raise the other leg. That's it.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.840
10 times. Go!

16:23.200 --> 16:25.520
One. Right, go on.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.600
I started when I was four
or five years old,

16:29.960 --> 16:31.960
and everyone wore Bayern fan gear.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.320
My birthday present was simple:
a Bayern jersey.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.480
It was all I needed.

16:40.120 --> 16:44.200
It wasn't a given that I would become
a professional player at Bayern.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.680
At first I just tried to be good enough
to become a pro.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.040
This focus on performance
has been with me from my earliest youth,

16:52.400 --> 16:56.840
driven on by the fierce winner attitude
even the Bayern youth players have.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.360
That rubs off,
but then, it also comes natural to me.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.000
Everyone here
is already special, because we've all

17:04.360 --> 17:07.840
managed to assert ourselves
in this rat race.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.240
Come on, Thomas. If you start talking,
the break will get far too long.

17:12.600 --> 17:17.000
Even Holger here, is just as
career-obsessed as the rest of us.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.320
Make no mistake! Or he wouldn't
have slept his way to the top.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.880
He's a really great guy. He can
be very funny, but also very annoying.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.920
He has no off-switch!

17:31.360 --> 17:34.680
I've never met any player
who could be so annoying,

17:35.040 --> 17:38.080
during training and in a match,
as Thomas Müller.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.280
So how can he be so good?

17:41.040 --> 17:45.360
He moves like an 8th-division player,
but he's so quick-witted

17:45.720 --> 17:47.800
that he's able to move faster

17:48.160 --> 17:49.920
than all the others.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.800
He's of such high quality
as I've never seen.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.840
He's one of the best German players
in soccer history.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.240
He's unbelievably efficient,
unbelievably clever,

18:05.600 --> 18:08.600
his moves
may look rather crude at times,

18:09.760 --> 18:12.640
but they're usually so right,
and sometimes just brilliant.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.720
He is a free spirit.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.640
He has to go wherever he wants.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.760
When I coached Bayern Munich,

18:21.120 --> 18:23.960
maybe I took a little too long
to understand him. It was my mistake.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.560
He is a …

18:26.200 --> 18:27.480
a top guy!

18:27.920 --> 18:31.880
I think we could spend
a great time together.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.040
Playing against him, however,
is really unpleasant.

18:36.480 --> 18:41.240
His distaste for everything that's
not Bayern is written all over his face.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.800
That makes it hard to just talk to him.
That's why we've never done that.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.520
To stay on top,
you sometimes have to be unpleasant.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.320
But it's not what I strive for.

18:52.680 --> 18:57.680
Not dying beautifully is my philosophy.
Not everyone appreciates that,

18:58.040 --> 19:01.640
but who likes people who always win?
In all honesty?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.320
Hold the end position a bit. Good.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.240
The Club World Cup in Doha
takes place at a time

19:09.600 --> 19:11.680
when sports are not all-important,

19:12.960 --> 19:16.440
because ethically, morally
and humanly

19:17.000 --> 19:20.600
there are more important things
right now, like surviving.

19:21.880 --> 19:26.440
But if you have the chance to play the
most successful season in 121 years,

19:26.800 --> 19:31.320
despite all the legends of the past,
you want to make that happen if you can.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.160
And honestly,
who'd have thought a year ago

19:36.680 --> 19:40.400
that we'd get such an opportunity
with this team?

19:42.440 --> 19:48.000
15 MONTHS EARLIER

19:48.800 --> 19:51.840
MATCHDAY 10 / NOVEMBER 2, 2019
EINTRACHT FRANKFURT VS. FC BAYERN

19:52.200 --> 19:56.360
Good afternoon and welcome to Bundesliga
football, welcome to Frankfurt!

19:59.560 --> 20:03.080
Taking his place is Gonçalo Paciência
up against Jérôme Boateng.

20:03.440 --> 20:07.000
Paciência!
That's gonna be a foul and a penalty.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.080
He's actually giving Boateng a red card!

20:13.040 --> 20:16.560
Bayern will be one man short
for 80 minutes.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.520
Here's a low cross,
the shot is deflected, and it's 1-0!

20:28.160 --> 20:30.120
Last season we got in a rut

20:30.480 --> 20:32.400
where we didn't get the desired results,

20:32.760 --> 20:35.000
didn't play the game we wanted,

20:35.360 --> 20:37.000
and didn't win.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.440
And it's a goal!
How bitter for Bayern.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.200
I wonder what's going through
his mind … and through their minds.

20:47.560 --> 20:52.600
There are no offensive fireworks.
Of course they're conceding goals,

20:52.960 --> 20:55.360
because they're terribly insecure.
- They lack speed and drive.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.440
Just look at the line-up.
And they even let Mats Hummels go.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.600
Do they lack technical class?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.280
What do they want to achieve
with this squad?

21:04.640 --> 21:07.120
Coman will be under scrutiny.
- Pavard won the World Cup,

21:07.480 --> 21:11.280
but the club he left
was relegated from the Bundesliga.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.520
Their transfer policy?
- If you look at what they spent …

21:16.720 --> 21:19.320
In November 2019

21:19.680 --> 21:23.440
we lost 5-1 to Frankfurt,
and you felt like …

21:23.800 --> 21:28.160
whatever our team was playing,
it wasn't the FC Bayern game.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.440
So that Sunday
we decided to let Niko Kovač go.

21:34.640 --> 21:38.320
Dortmund topped the league at the time,
we were in 5th or 6th place.

21:38.680 --> 21:44.000
Hansi was assistant coach,
and we decided to make him head coach.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.280
Until further notice.
- Hi, Hansi. - Hi.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.520
I'm sure you have many questions,
so let's get started. - It's a big step

21:51.880 --> 21:57.640
to become head coach, so it was
discussed at length within the club.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.760
"Will he be able to handle it?"
and so on.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.720
FC BAYERN VS. BORUSSIA DORTMUND
NOVEMBER 19, 2019

22:08.360 --> 22:09.360
It's Hansi Flick's

22:09.800 --> 22:14.200
first Bundesliga match as head coach

22:14.560 --> 22:16.120
for FC Bayern.

22:16.480 --> 22:20.480
Here we go! Bayern against Dortmund,
always an important game,

22:20.840 --> 22:23.200
always with great repercussions.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.640
Bayern get through on the right side,
a low cross from Gnabry.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.560
Pavard puts it in the center,
and Lewi!

22:31.440 --> 22:33.840
Boom! Boom! Lewi scores!

22:34.560 --> 22:38.640
Kimmich to Müller. Lewandowski
and Gnabry to his right. Lewandowski …

22:39.000 --> 22:40.400
Gnabry scores!

22:41.600 --> 22:45.200
Lewandowski to Müller.
Lewandowski!

22:45.560 --> 22:49.400
3-0, Bayern Munich, 76 minutes played.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.280
Hansi Flick with his manner

22:53.760 --> 22:59.040
and character coupled with this squad
were a match made in soccer heaven.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.920
And suddenly they're soaring.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.120
We kind of goaded ourselves on.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.400
Every success
gave us more confidence.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.240
We were like a black hole

23:23.600 --> 23:25.440
that kept growing.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.920
The Canadian's speed is unmatched.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.920
The joy, the enthusiasm, the quality!

23:37.280 --> 23:41.240
Even those who are against Bayern,
loved the way they played soccer.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.160
On March 8 we played a match
against Augsburg.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.120
With a sold-out stadium.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.160
When we went into lockdown,

24:05.200 --> 24:09.760
we drew all the right conclusions
and prepared the squad

24:10.120 --> 24:12.680
from day 1
for what might be coming.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.880
Lucas is here … And the next one.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.640
Right!
- That's perfect.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.880
It took us less than two days
to implement our scheme

24:24.240 --> 24:27.520
to keep the guys fit without any hiatus.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.800
So get to it. Have fun.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.200
Everything came together perfectly,

24:36.280 --> 24:40.360
and we got through the lockdown
in a phenomenal way.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.120
We'll have to get used to
empty stadiums,

24:46.920 --> 24:49.280
but at least
they're playing soccer again.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.280
FC Bayern Munich
visiting Borussia Dortmund.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.520
We were so sure of ourselves.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.720
We had this awesome attitude!

25:09.840 --> 25:13.360
What impressed me most
was their determination.

25:14.120 --> 25:18.040
They never tried to hold on to the ball,
even though they were leading 4-0.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.280
They just kept going and going.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.520
GERMAN CHAMPIONS - JUNE 27, 2020

25:35.760 --> 25:38.640
It was outstanding
what the squad did there.

25:39.440 --> 25:43.360
And it was just great fun
to be part of that.

25:45.320 --> 25:48.360
GERMAN CUP WINNERS - JULY 4, 2020

25:48.720 --> 25:54.440
We didn't play matches, we crushed
everything that crossed our path.

25:54.880 --> 25:59.400
And it culminated in the
Champions League Tournament in Lisbon.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.520
The conditions here are ideal.
It's almost like a holiday.

26:08.640 --> 26:13.760
An incredibly positive
atmosphere developed.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.640
I got the impression,
"These guys want to do great things!"

26:18.080 --> 26:21.840
These two and a half weeks were
the most beautiful I ever experienced.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.400
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTERFINAL
FC BAYERN VS. FC BARCELONA 08/14/2020

26:25.720 --> 26:30.360
Thomas Müller passes to Lewandowski,
a nice one-two, and it's 2-1 for Bayern!

26:30.760 --> 26:32.440
It was a joy.

26:33.160 --> 26:37.560
This squad plays
on an enormously high level.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.680
The way they play is …
They're machines, they go forward!

26:43.040 --> 26:48.080
I'm a big fan, so I was sitting there,
saying, "How good, how attractive!"

26:55.320 --> 26:59.520
Watching a game like that, where you
take a team like Barcelona apart,

26:59.880 --> 27:02.680
it's as if you could fly.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.800
And if our fans had been there,
if 70,000 people

27:10.160 --> 27:13.000
had been in that stadium,
they would've torn it apart!

27:13.360 --> 27:18.280
8-2, this is a true rout!
A show of dominance.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.240
They're now favorites
to win the Champions League.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.200
Great save, man.
- Badass!

27:27.040 --> 27:28.840
I remember the headlines.

27:29.200 --> 27:33.160
The whole world was saying
what a unique squad this was.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.000
Who could possibly beat them?

27:36.360 --> 27:40.200
Here come the Bayern side, led out
by Captain Manuel Neuer, of course.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.520
In a mixture of calm, composure

27:42.880 --> 27:45.600
and some smiles early on.
Serge Gnabry in particular.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.840
"Do not change a winning team,"
the attitude from coach Hansi Flick.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.120
And the guys increasingly felt,
"This is our chance!"

27:54.480 --> 27:58.080
Here's Gnabry. Hasn't run out of space,
goes for it … What a goal!

27:58.440 --> 28:00.640
It's like a rush you get into.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.080
Perišić … into the center …
How has that not gone in? Now it has!

28:06.440 --> 28:10.440
The legendary Berti Vogts once said,
"To win a tournament like this,

28:10.800 --> 28:13.800
you have to jump on the right 'cloud',

28:14.160 --> 28:17.920
and then you sail
through the tournament on it."

28:18.920 --> 28:22.560
These guys certainly did
jump on the right cloud.

28:23.640 --> 28:27.960
Lewandowski! FC Bayern Munich
are in the Champions League final

28:28.320 --> 28:30.960
for the first time
since having won it back in 2013.

28:32.280 --> 28:35.560
The idea of eleven friends,
of one spirit,

28:35.920 --> 28:39.320
that most of us no longer believed
existed in soccer:

28:39.680 --> 28:41.240
this team is living it.

28:43.560 --> 28:47.920
It was nice to see the morale of
this squad. That's when I felt like,

28:48.280 --> 28:51.520
"Okay, with this team spirit
they're going to win many titles."

28:53.200 --> 28:57.080
They were basically the same players,
but Hansi has the ability

28:57.440 --> 29:00.000
to bring a team together.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.560
That was something quite extraordinary.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.720
Yeah, man!

29:13.520 --> 29:16.360
I was absolutely sure
Bayern was going to win.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.920
I support Bayern. Sorry.
Just look at their body language,

29:21.280 --> 29:26.800
their presence on the pitch. They all
stick together, even those on the bench,

29:27.160 --> 29:29.000
the physiotherapists, everyone.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.720
It is UEFA Champions League night,

29:32.080 --> 29:34.000
and FC Bayern Munich

29:34.360 --> 29:36.160
are involved.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.280
Still goosebumps,

29:38.640 --> 29:42.560
it doesn't matter if anyone's here
or not, the Champions League final …

29:43.520 --> 29:46.000
You're ready?
- Starting now.

29:46.360 --> 29:50.080
The more you win,
the more confidence you have,

29:50.440 --> 29:54.200
and the more confidence you have,
the more you win.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.720
I ranked Bayern number one.
An average performance wouldn't do,

30:03.080 --> 30:07.360
because Bayern had the fitter team.
But that's the thing with soccer …

30:08.200 --> 30:10.480
everything's possible.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.320
The ball was on the right,

30:31.680 --> 30:33.240
then Serge passed it to me.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.520
Then the ball came back

30:36.880 --> 30:40.680
to Jo, who played a cross to me
and I headed it home.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.960
With my eyes shut. But it was a goal.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.920
Heading with my eyes shut
is my specialty.

30:53.200 --> 30:58.040
If Kingsley Coman starts heading goals,
luck is no longer on your side.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.160
Or maybe Bayern simply deserved to win.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.600
What gave me goosebumps

31:10.240 --> 31:12.400
was how the players reacted

31:12.760 --> 31:14.640
after the final whistle.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.480
Of course they are a legendary team now.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.880
They've got a place
in the history books.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.360
You did a phenomenal job.
You can be proud of it.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.880
Brazzo, come here.

32:01.720 --> 32:06.040
My thanks go to you, men, the players.

32:06.400 --> 32:10.160
It was just sensational. I've never …
Granted, it wasn't too hard.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.360
But I've never coached
a team like you before. Thank you!

32:13.800 --> 32:15.680
The team was so hungry!

32:16.120 --> 32:19.120
They really wanted this title as well.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.800
The ball enters the box …

32:23.280 --> 32:26.800
Alaba …
Here's the rebound … Martinez!

32:30.240 --> 32:33.720
Javi Martinez, what a story!

32:34.080 --> 32:35.840
GERMAN SUPER CUP - SEPTEMBER 30, 2020

32:49.840 --> 32:52.080
GERMAN SUPER CUP WINNERS

32:53.760 --> 32:57.120
It's a great squad.
They've just won five titles.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.800
And I wish them good luck
on winning the sixth one in Doha,

33:01.160 --> 33:06.680
because this squad wants it badly,
and I'm optimistic that they'll succeed.

33:16.120 --> 33:20.840
FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP
DOHA - FEBRUARY 6, 2021

33:21.200 --> 33:24.720
Listen up. It's now 5:23 pm.
We'll have local time for a week.

33:25.080 --> 33:29.720
So we're now on our way to the hotel
where you'll go straight to your rooms.

33:30.520 --> 33:33.720
Don't hang around in the hallway
or someone else's room.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.560
Stay in your rooms. Until I text you
the thumbs up, you're in quarantine.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.120
What about the connecting door?

33:41.560 --> 33:44.960
Not the connecting door either, no.
- Can you give us

33:45.320 --> 33:47.800
an approximate time?
- Some time tonight.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.760
They need 6 to 8 hours. Later on
I'll send you the schedule for the day.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.760
Okay, dynamic knee angles,
swing your left and right hands.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.040
Everyone on the whole team
has a big workload,

34:12.520 --> 34:16.000
coaches, video analysts,
physiotherapists, doctors, players …

34:18.600 --> 34:23.680
There are times when we have to work
straight through for three weeks.

34:24.040 --> 34:28.160
FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP SEMIFINAL
FC BAYERN VS. AL AHLY SC - 02/08/2021

35:04.320 --> 35:08.680
FEBRUARY 9, 2021
TEAM HOTEL FC BAYERN, DOHA, QATAR

35:10.000 --> 35:13.960
Yes, I think now you can fill the water.
- Fill the water to which level?

35:16.480 --> 35:17.920
Of course I'm still …

35:18.360 --> 35:22.520
rather new in the squad.
I'm still more or less

35:22.880 --> 35:24.760
getting to know everyone.

35:25.760 --> 35:29.400
What's special about this squad
is its hunger to keep going.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.720
I want to be a part of that

35:32.160 --> 35:35.920
and do my bit
to go on achieving these goals.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.200
Crap …

35:48.320 --> 35:52.320
The day after tomorrow
we're playing the Club World Cup Final.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.480
And now look at Choupo,
sitting there, thinking

35:55.840 --> 35:58.160
we're in Dubai, expecting a pool party.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.840
Just look at Choupo!

36:02.200 --> 36:03.800
Let him be, he's cool.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.000
There's so much pressure in top sport.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.520
So if the team spirit isn't good,

36:20.880 --> 36:23.080
if there's no time to relax
in the daily routine,

36:23.440 --> 36:26.160
you're making life much more difficult.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.960
Cover him!

36:31.640 --> 36:34.560
We have great team spirit, and our squad

36:34.920 --> 36:37.320
has shown great character.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.440
We're almost like a family.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.520
That's Leroy's tactics,

36:49.880 --> 36:52.000
stand around with the ball.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.040
Now! Now!
- I think that's it!

37:07.360 --> 37:08.520
Enough?
- Yeah.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.520
Do we need all this backyard kicking?

37:25.440 --> 37:29.400
At the end of the training session
I received a phone call, saying

37:29.760 --> 37:32.760
Thomas had tested positive.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.920
I have to hang up. We'll talk later.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.280
We immediately
separated Thomas from the squad,

37:40.640 --> 37:45.120
so as not to disrupt
our preparation for the final.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.560
You stay in your room for now.
- Okay.

37:48.920 --> 37:52.960
You may have to change rooms
within the hotel later on. - Yes.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.200
Your room key.
- Enter the lift alone.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.160
We have to wait for the test result.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.480
And then we'll see what happens.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.440
He might have cleaned his room.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.880
Later that evening
a second test was done.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.960
Where is Tommy?
- In his room just now.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.400
And this second test was also positive.

38:29.600 --> 38:34.560
FEBRUARY 11, 2021 - TACTICS MEETING
AHEAD OF THE FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP FINAL

38:35.720 --> 38:38.640
We came to Doha

38:40.520 --> 38:42.680
to win our sixth title.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.160
Men, nothing else matters,
only this sixth title.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.240
Each one of you can become
part of the most successful

38:50.600 --> 38:53.400
FC Bayern squad of all time.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.280
You can write history.

38:56.760 --> 39:02.200
Remember, men: every tackle, every yard,
every pass, every shot will count

39:02.920 --> 39:06.120
to win this thing, okay?

39:06.600 --> 39:10.240
Be sharp. Give everything you got
for this sixth title.

39:10.600 --> 39:16.160
Give everything you got for those of you
who can't be here: Thomas, Jérôme,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.960
Leon, Javi, Alex,

39:19.440 --> 39:21.520
Tanguy, Malik.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.800
Let's go and have fun!

39:39.560 --> 39:42.920
FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP FINAL
FC BAYERN VS. UANL TIGRES - 02/11/2021

39:43.400 --> 39:46.560
Get ready for the final
of the FIFA Club World Championship

39:46.920 --> 39:50.960
between Tigres from CONCACAF and
Champions League winners Bayern Munich.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.280
The goal is under review.
And it's ruled out.

40:18.600 --> 40:22.840
Kimmich once more.
Decisive passing … and here it is!

40:24.840 --> 40:27.120
The goal is given.

40:29.560 --> 40:35.200
So Bayern on course for that desperately
desired sixth triumph of the year.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.400
We go into four minutes of added time.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.880
Six competitions they've entered,

40:42.720 --> 40:45.280
six they will have won
if they hold out here.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.080
Final minute!

40:47.440 --> 40:50.080
Tigres are still quite keen

40:50.440 --> 40:54.360
to get an equalizing goal here, to
at least take the match into extra time.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.920
Men, 30 seconds!

40:58.400 --> 40:59.320
Men, 30!

41:06.560 --> 41:11.480
With their 1-0 success today,
Bayern Munich continue to be invincible.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.680
They are the champions!

41:14.120 --> 41:19.520
It was always, "Go, go, go!"
It was always like this. What can I do?

41:21.880 --> 41:24.160
Champions League, Club World Cup …

41:24.520 --> 41:28.680
But first the Euros this summer.
- Nah, no Euros, I'll be on holiday.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.920
You okay?
- Another dead game.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.400
Easy. Look, we're fighting
and running, man …

41:44.240 --> 41:48.160
Our forward play wasn't 100 percent.
Always too scared.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.240
We lacked strength.

41:50.600 --> 41:54.120
Today's wasn't …
- But it's the final! - I know …

41:54.480 --> 41:57.680
Sometimes we should play simpler.
You know, tick-tick …

41:58.040 --> 42:00.880
One, two passes, no more.
- A pass, a one-two, and off we go.

42:01.240 --> 42:04.520
If you play a cross-field pass
you get a one-on-one battle every time.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.960
Then he can center the ball, whatever.
- It's like I said about the goals.

42:08.320 --> 42:11.880
If you switch the play,
you create space and you can center.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.880
You have to switch play
to the other side and free the ball.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.960
Wonderful scene.

42:18.840 --> 42:23.040
It's a perfect description
of what matters most,

42:23.560 --> 42:25.640
staying hungry.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.120
To talk about the future
right after your biggest triumph.

42:31.480 --> 42:36.920
That's exactly what coaches and players
should preserve to stay successful,

42:37.280 --> 42:41.200
because other teams
will be chasing them for the titles.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.760
I mean, winning six titles is great.

43:19.200 --> 43:23.800
But when Bayern wins six titles,
it means they will have to defend them.

43:24.160 --> 43:27.720
I think he feels
the pressure mounting, like,

43:28.080 --> 43:31.440
"God, what will the future hold?
All we can do now is lose!"

43:31.880 --> 43:34.720
That'll be going through his head now.

43:35.080 --> 43:41.000
Working for Bayern, you have to live
with this permanent pressure to succeed.
