WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.238
I go by Peter.
I still think that I don't know

00:04.272 --> 00:05.306
what I want to be
when I grow up.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.574
Is that crazy?
That's endearing.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.675
I had a wonderful night.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.310
I wish I could stay longer.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.312
Is there any chance
you want to go to

00:11.345 --> 00:13.114
this fund-raiser thing
with me? It's for my uncle.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.182
He's the mayor of Fillmore.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.116
Mayor Gainey.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.684
(chuckles):
Yeah.
I am in.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.186
GEORGE:
 The sex was amazing.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.720
With Lemon?!
Shh!

00:19.753 --> 00:21.122
Every time I look at her,

00:21.155 --> 00:23.257
I am physically unable
to stop picturing it.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.558
What are you doing?

00:24.592 --> 00:25.726
Packing up Joel's stuff.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.561
Ah.
I mean, I-I could have

00:27.595 --> 00:30.231
gone to L.A., or to London,
but I chose not to.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.266
What if I made
the biggest mistake of my life

00:32.299 --> 00:35.769
and let the right person
just walk away forever?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.140
*

00:42.843 --> 00:45.646
George, what are you doing?

00:49.350 --> 00:52.820
I was just checking this cereal
for high fructose corn syrup.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.188
There's a lot of it.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.156
Well, you know what?

00:55.189 --> 00:56.757
I'm really glad to see you.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.858
Oh.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.760
Because I've come to
a huge revelation.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.130
I'm swearing off
the opposite sex.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.697
I'm going on
a three-month man cleanse.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.299
A "man cleanse"?

01:05.333 --> 01:06.700
I'm flushing out my system.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.836
I'm gonna recharge,
so I'm ready for the right man.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.372
And until then,
I'm putting my mind

01:11.405 --> 01:13.841
and my body and my soul
into Fancie's.

01:13.874 --> 01:14.908
And listen, I know

01:14.942 --> 01:17.645
that you want to be
more of a silent partner now...

01:17.678 --> 01:19.147
Yes, I do. Very much.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.214
And I fully support that.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.081
Great.
But I'm gonna need

01:21.115 --> 01:22.350
your help redoing the books
this Sunday.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.584
No. (laughs)
Great!

01:23.617 --> 01:25.586
Thank you, George,
for your support on this.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.588
Bye.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.789
What?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.791
No men. A cleanse.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.361
Won't be hard; it's not like
fantastic guys are just

01:33.394 --> 01:34.862
floating around BlueBell.
(laughs)

01:34.895 --> 01:36.630
Whoa.
Oh, God.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.631
I am so sorry.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.667
Peter?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.369
Hey.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.304
(chuckles)

01:43.337 --> 01:44.605
Wow.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.906
(chuckles)

01:45.939 --> 01:48.342
This reunion went
a lot smoother in my head.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.611
What are you doing here?

01:50.644 --> 01:52.213
I'm producing
an incredibly boring story

01:52.246 --> 01:53.747
on an algae bloom in Mobile.

01:53.781 --> 01:58.219
Which I volunteered for,
uh... so I could see you.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.221
What?
(chuckles)

02:00.254 --> 02:02.223
Well, I mean, it's been
six months, I mean...

02:02.256 --> 02:03.357
Is there any chance that, uh,

02:03.391 --> 02:04.725
you'd have dinner
with me tomorrow?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.394
Dinner?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.196
What? Uh, I...

02:08.229 --> 02:09.229
Um... Hmm...

02:09.263 --> 02:10.898
Can I get back to you on that?

02:10.931 --> 02:13.234
Yeah. Yeah, sure, uh,
you're probably busy.
Okay. (laughs)

02:14.402 --> 02:16.437
Let me give you my card.
Sure.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.672
I'm in town until Sunday.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.841
I hope it works out.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.676
(chuckles)

02:22.710 --> 02:24.345
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.782
Hi.
Hi.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.351
Can I, uh, have
an English muffin?

02:30.384 --> 02:33.287
Aw... Joel used to put a hole
in an English muffin

02:33.321 --> 02:34.822
and pretend it was a bagel,

02:34.855 --> 02:37.825
and now you're eating one
to fill a hole in your heart.

02:37.858 --> 02:38.959
Joel? Who's Joel?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.262
Yeah, forget the English muffin.
Just give me some pie.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.396
Okay.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.397
(sighs)

02:43.431 --> 02:44.898
Thank you.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.736
Hey, Zoe, great
news, I hope.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.404
The renovation on
your and Joel...

02:50.438 --> 02:52.406
your house is done.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.708
Wow.
I assume you want to
put it on the market.

02:54.742 --> 02:55.809
I can have...

02:55.843 --> 02:57.278
No, I'm not going
to sell my house.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.679
You'll get a good price.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.348
It's the perfect place
for a young, happy couple

03:00.381 --> 03:02.450
just starting out...
No. No young happy couple

03:02.483 --> 03:05.286
is moving into our hou...
into my house.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.687
I love that house.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.256
I can be my own
young, happy couple.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.723
Yes, ma'am.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.692
I can find someone else.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.261
I mean, I found Joel.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.962
Sure, yeah,
that was in New York,

03:14.995 --> 03:16.397
but I can...
Whoa!

03:16.430 --> 03:17.765
(screams)

03:17.798 --> 03:19.900
Ow! Watch it!
You okay?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.435
Huh! Yeah.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.003
Sorry. I thought
you'd see my bike

03:23.036 --> 03:24.872
moving towards you and stop,

03:24.905 --> 03:26.707
because most people do.
Well, I am not

03:26.740 --> 03:28.476
most people.
Tell you what,
I'll make it up to you.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.311
Dinner, tomorrow night.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.913
Did you just...

03:32.946 --> 03:35.483
I'm sorry, did you just
ask me out on a date?

03:35.516 --> 03:37.851
You know it.
W...

03:37.885 --> 03:39.987
Well, I'm gonna have to
get back to you on that.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.790
Okay. My name is Vince.
Here's my card.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.960
And, uh, till then,
watch where you're going.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.529
W...

03:51.031 --> 03:53.000
There's a situation.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.002
Lavon, I really
need some advice.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.904
(gasps)
Is that a little doll

03:56.937 --> 03:58.739
Ferris wheel?
Ah! Off!

03:58.772 --> 03:59.907
Ow!
It's not
a doll anything.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.875
This is BlueBell's future.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.877
Getting ready to pitch
the city commissioners

04:03.911 --> 04:06.447
on having the county fair
right here.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.048
That sounds fun.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.483
Fun?

04:09.517 --> 04:10.884
Monumental is more like it.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.486
Point is,
I really need some advice.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.487
Long as it's not about boys.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.923
It's totally not... about boys

04:15.956 --> 04:17.458
that you know.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.959
Out.
Oh, come on!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.560
No, every conversation
we've ever had about boys

04:20.594 --> 04:22.896
is me telling you one thing
and you not listening.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.365
Go. Exit.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.367
Ah, ah, ah! Stop!

04:26.400 --> 04:28.769
Find someone else
not to listen to.

04:28.802 --> 04:32.373
And that's how Great Uncle
Nehemiah met his third wife--

04:32.406 --> 04:34.442
you remember, the one
with the glass eye.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.043
Great Aunt Duffy?

04:36.076 --> 04:38.011
Close. But it was
Great Aunt Margie.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.414
God!
Oh, Great Aunt Margie
 also had a glass eye.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.516
There you go.
You're really becoming
one of us, kid.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.585
I've spent a lot of time
with you guys.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.520
Wilkes picnics,
Wilkes barbecues,

04:46.554 --> 04:48.789
Wilkes piano recitals.
What can I say?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.458
We Wilkes love
each other.
All right.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.893
Wade! Made this home
brew in the cow barn.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.996
Oh, the cow barn,
you say. Wow.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.368
I can... I can taste
the-the barley

05:00.401 --> 05:02.536
and the... essence of cow.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.338
I was totally going for that.
Nailed it.

05:04.372 --> 05:07.341
Sorry, guys, I'm gonna need Wade
to, uh, to slice the tomatoes.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.809
Gazpacho emergency.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.344
Gazpacho emergency.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.580
I'm gonna whup your
butt next game.
All right.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.350
Come on.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.425
I have been waiting
an hour to do that.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.559
Me, too.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.627
But prying eyes...

05:26.660 --> 05:28.629
Most of which are glass.
I know!

05:28.662 --> 05:30.864
Thankfully, not genetic.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.835
Wade, you have been
such a trouper with my family,

05:34.868 --> 05:35.969
but you need a break.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.372
Tomorrow night,
we are on our own.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.973
But tomorrow is
Wilkes fish fry night.

05:40.007 --> 05:40.974
No, it's not.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.109
I mean, it is.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.077
But for us,
it's Wade Kinsella Night.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.579
Oh, well, that sounds nice.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.648
JANICE:
Oh, Wade, there you are!

05:47.681 --> 05:49.983
I brought you
this barbecue pork.

05:50.017 --> 05:50.918
Okay.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.021
Wade Kinsella Night.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.023
Promise.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.631
Is today the day?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.098
Should we finally
venture outside

06:05.132 --> 06:07.067
as a couple for breakfast?

06:07.100 --> 06:09.437
Can we hide a little
while longer?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.038
Oh, Davis, you're...

06:11.071 --> 06:13.474
amazing, but you
don't understand.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.443
In BlueBell, dating
a Gainey is...

06:15.476 --> 06:18.111
almost as bad as dating
a Florida State fan.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.179
Got it.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.415
I'm sure we can find
some other ways

06:21.449 --> 06:22.883
to keep ourselves occupied.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.184
Hmm.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.019
(phone ringing)

06:26.053 --> 06:27.054
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.556
Mm, mm.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.657
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.924
Mm. Hello?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.493
AnnaBeth,
where have you been?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.161
You won't believe
who's in town.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.463
Peter, from Halloween.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.598
And he asked me to dinner.
What do I do?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.066
Go! Have fun.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.168
(sighs) But if you had
gotten my previous message,

06:41.201 --> 06:43.637
you would know that
I am on a man cleanse.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.105
Oh, I see.
Then don't go.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.206
But it's Peter!

06:46.239 --> 06:48.208
I've been thinking
about him for months.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.711
But then again, I haven't
heard from him, at all.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.514
And now, out of the blue,
he wants to have dinner with me?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.115
What do I do?
(line beeping)

06:55.148 --> 06:57.217
Um, hold on, Lemon.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.052
(phone beeps)
Hello?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.053
AnnaBeth, where
have you been?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.555
I just got asked
out on a date.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.491
Well, good for you.
Have fun.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.126
But he was wearing a bike shirt
and he seemed kind of pompous.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.194
Maybe it's too soon?

07:07.227 --> 07:08.996
Um, no, it is.
Don't go.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.531
But then again,
I want to move on.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.533
You know, the first date
could be the first step.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.635
I just didn't think I'd
have to do it today.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.669
What do you think?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.605
Y-Yeah, hold that thought.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.474
Zoe, Lemon, I believe
you two know each other.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.942
Now, I am gonna be

07:21.975 --> 07:23.677
out of commission
for the rest of the morning.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.045
All day.
All day.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.147
And in interesting news,
you both are trying to decide

07:27.180 --> 07:29.149
whether or not
to go on a date tomorrow.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.051
So you two talk
to each other.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.553
You need to.
Love you. Bye!

07:32.586 --> 07:34.588
Don't hang up!
AnnaBeth, wait!

07:36.590 --> 07:38.091
I'll figure this out
on my own.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.761
I'd rather talk
to my laundry.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.230
(car horn honks)

07:43.263 --> 07:45.499
(seagulls calling)

07:45.533 --> 07:47.601
(birds singing)

07:51.805 --> 07:55.709
Wow. I mean, the county fair
right here in BlueBell?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.745
Do you... you really think
we stand a chance?

07:57.778 --> 08:00.047
Well, after the rat
fiasco in Fairhope,

08:00.080 --> 08:01.549
you know, we may.
(chuckles)

08:01.582 --> 08:03.584
Well, the Fair Commission
hears my pitch tomorrow,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.052
but I'm gonna come
up with a plan.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.521
That's why they
call me The Closer.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.689
Never heard anyone
call you that.

08:08.722 --> 08:09.723
No.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.758
(knocking)

08:14.695 --> 08:16.630
Mayor Hayes, good morning!

08:16.664 --> 08:18.766
I brought you a big old donut.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.270
Gainey. Let me guess.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.272
You heard about my
county fair pitch,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.775
and you came here to
try to kill my mojo.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.242
You think tiny little BlueBell's
gonna get it?

08:29.276 --> 08:32.813
Uh, you know,
Lavon, it's the county fair,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.548
not the everyone-
you-can-fit-

08:34.582 --> 08:36.015
in-a-mid-size-sedan fair.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.150
But, hey, that's
not why I'm here.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.620
I see right through your...
your big donut, Gainey.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.054
It has a hole.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.155
Lavon, no. I'm here
to celebrate the good news.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.260
You know, about my beloved
nephew dating your niece.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.629
We gonna be related.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.631
What? Wha...
Who's your nephew dating?

08:50.664 --> 08:51.632
AnnaBeth Nass.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.634
Oh, wait.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.303
Is she not your niece?

08:56.336 --> 08:57.404
Oops. My bad.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.240
Well, uh, look, I'll let you
get back to your pitch,

09:00.273 --> 09:02.643
and, uh, enjoy that donut--
really good.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.814
Lavon, hey, hey.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.116
Gainey is just trying
to get in your head.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.318
Okay, what he said,
probably not even true.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.153
Oh, it best not be true.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.655
Okay you need to just...
(breathes deeply)

09:14.688 --> 09:16.790
Wha...
...concentrate
on your pitch.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.726
Yeah, you're right.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.862
Maybe the big donut will help.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.067
So, I've made some bad decisions
concerning men.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.802
But Peter's only here
for one day.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.270
And living life to the fullest

09:30.303 --> 09:32.640
is always
a good decision, right?

09:32.673 --> 09:33.774
Right?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.275
(sighs)

09:36.844 --> 09:39.212
AnnaBeth?
(frustrated grunt)

09:39.246 --> 09:40.781
(exhales sharply)

09:42.115 --> 09:43.183
Three weeks.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.253
Three weeks is plenty of time
to get over someone.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.222
We weren't even together
a year, right?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.858
(sighs)

09:52.325 --> 09:53.627
Hmm.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.729
AnnaBeth?

09:55.763 --> 09:58.231
(frustrated grunt)

09:58.265 --> 10:00.701
Peter, it's Lemon. Hi.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.102
Hi, Vince. It's Zoe.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.237
The woman that you hit
with the bicycle.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.405
I'd love to have dinner
tomorrow night.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.308
I'm ready to get
back on the bicycle.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.643
Uh, w...

10:09.677 --> 10:11.679
So, yes. The answer is yes.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.681
A-About dinner.
Which is a meal.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.115
Why don't you come over.
I'll cook. Okay?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.717
See you then.
All right. Thanks. Bye.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.751
(sighs)

10:17.785 --> 10:18.886
(shudders)

10:18.919 --> 10:20.620
Oh, my God.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.263
"Well, BlueBell may be small,
but what we lack in resources,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.933
we make up for in commitment
and heart..."

10:32.966 --> 10:34.167
DASH:
Mayor Hayes.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.436
I was wondering if, uh,

10:36.469 --> 10:39.306
you'd like to comment
on the fact that AnnaBeth Nass

10:39.339 --> 10:41.274
was seen last night

10:41.308 --> 10:43.343
waiting outside a Mobile CVS

10:43.376 --> 10:45.212
while Davis Polk,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.180
nephew of our sworn enemy,

10:47.214 --> 10:48.749
was seen inside

10:48.782 --> 10:51.184
buying prophylactics.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.454
Well, I'm sure that was
just a coincidence.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.891
Well, then they were seen
getting in a car together

10:57.925 --> 11:00.327
and driving back
to her place.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.230
Uh, the mayor has
no comment at this time, Dash.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.832
Thank you so much.
Have a great day.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.166
Well, all righty then.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.768
(laughs)

11:09.302 --> 11:10.904
"Prophylactics"?

11:10.938 --> 11:13.173
"Prophylactics"?!
Okay, Lavon.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.742
You need to go home,
you need to shut your windows,

11:14.775 --> 11:15.943
you need to
lock your doors,

11:15.976 --> 11:17.778
turn off your Internet,

11:17.811 --> 11:18.912
and just focus
on this presentation

11:18.946 --> 11:20.413
until your meeting tonight.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.316
Go home.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.755
Daddy!

11:27.788 --> 11:29.189
Magnolia?

11:29.222 --> 11:30.958
What are you doing here? Oh!

11:30.991 --> 11:34.862
I have managed to escape the
clutches of your horrible mother

11:34.895 --> 11:37.264
to ask politely if
there's any chance

11:37.297 --> 11:39.199
you'll let me go
to a party tonight.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.902
I-I imagine Grandma's
already said no.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.804
She's unreasonable,
but you're not like her.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.774
You're so smart
and even-tempered.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.242
I know you'll understand
how important this is to me.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.211
Yeah, I will.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.512
Tell me something
about this party.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.748
It's the social
event of the season.

11:54.782 --> 11:58.218
Carter Covington is hosting
a party at his vacation home

11:58.251 --> 11:59.486
in Charleston.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.321
"Charleston"?

12:01.354 --> 12:04.391
Carter Covington is
30 years old!

12:04.424 --> 12:05.425
Yeah, well, it just so happens

12:05.458 --> 12:07.828
I'm not invited to people
my own age's parties

12:07.861 --> 12:09.362
because you
put me in exile.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.364
And I'm living in a
house that smells like

12:11.398 --> 12:12.432
IcyHot and cruelty.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.435
And the school you're
sending me to has no boys.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.305
This is my only chance
to find some joy in my life.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.539
Well, maybe you should've
thought about joy

12:19.572 --> 12:21.274
before you got kicked
out of boarding school

12:21.308 --> 12:22.876
finding joy
in a 19-year-old townie!

12:22.910 --> 12:25.879
Now, you get on back to your
grandmother's this instant.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.882
And I will have her call me
the second she sees your face.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.918
You're just as bad as she is.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.420
A chip off the old IcyHot block.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.825
(sighs)

12:37.858 --> 12:40.027
Thank you.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.394
Lemon.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.064
Are you gonna eat that entire
cheesecake alone?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.333
Actually, I have
a date tonight with Peter,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.335
that wonderful man
I met on Halloween.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.838
Wow. Has he moved to town?
No.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.307
Is this one of those booty calls
I read about?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.576
Well, maybe it is.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.978
But so what?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.412
I mean, haven't you
ever watched HBO?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.280
No.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.082
Well... neither have I.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.316
But I get the gist.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.052
It is 2014,
and women are allowed

13:05.085 --> 13:07.287
to have relations
with whomever they want.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.989
But that is not Belle behavior.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.959
Well, if you haven't noticed,
I am not a Belle anymore.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.027
So, I will be
having sex tonight.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.528
And enjoying
my own liberation.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.831
Good afternoon.
(quiet laugh)

13:21.134 --> 13:22.102
Cardio.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.837
Hey, good, Lavon.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.038
I have a quick question.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.539
It's not about boys.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.540
Per se.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.443
But should I go with a V-neck
or a boat-neck?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.112
For what?
I've got a date tonight!

13:32.145 --> 13:33.580
Isn't that awesome?

13:33.613 --> 13:34.848
I'm moving on.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.384
Well, of course you are.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.052
That's how you females

13:39.086 --> 13:40.420
get over people.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.056
You just find someone new,
and bam!

13:43.090 --> 13:44.925
Look how happy you could be.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.860
Better buy some prophylactics!

13:46.894 --> 13:48.929
What?! Wha...
Sex could happen?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.931
I wasn't even planning on
sharing an appetizer.

13:50.964 --> 13:51.999
Well, why not?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.366
Share an appetizer.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.102
Share your bed.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.905
You know, I should, too.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.440
Yeah, we all should just go out
and sleep with whoever.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.943
And... move on!

14:04.444 --> 14:06.446
Okay.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.052
Hey, Wanda, I'm gonna need you
to close up tonight.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.454
Another Wilkes family
talent show?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.356
No, actually a friend of mine
bought a wine bar

14:16.389 --> 14:18.525
over in Mobile, so I'm taking
Vivian for the opening.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.993
A civilized,
adult evening with...

14:20.027 --> 14:21.361
CHARLES:
* In your van

14:21.394 --> 14:22.495
* And you wish
you had a can *

14:22.529 --> 14:24.497
* Diarrhea, diarrhea

14:24.531 --> 14:25.598
* When you're
fishing in a lake *

14:25.632 --> 14:26.900
* And your belly
starts to ache *

14:26.934 --> 14:27.834
* Diarrhea...
Hey, hey,

14:27.867 --> 14:30.370
y'all, we got people trying
to eat here.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.438
Come on.
Sorry, man.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.572
We're trying to cheer Harley up.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.673
Oh, no. You guys lose?

14:33.706 --> 14:34.975
Uh, they won.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.543
I set a new record
for no-hitters.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.545
Which would be great
if I pitched.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.113
Which I don't.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.415
You can count
my batting average

14:42.449 --> 14:43.516
with no fingers.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.052
Ooh, man.
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.187
Good news is I got something
to take the sting off.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.489
You come right this way.
Wanda, why don't you

14:49.522 --> 14:51.024
mix up a root beer float
for this young man.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.393
Make it extra strong.
Keep 'em coming.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.396
Well, I am gonna go shower.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.631
And I'll swing by
to pick Harley up around 5:00.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.500
Thanks for taking him.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.936
Oh, I hope this isn't weird,
but Aunt Winifred invited me

15:02.970 --> 15:04.571
to take Harley
by her fish fry tonight.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.973
You mind if we go?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.140
Oh.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.943
Sure. Yeah.
He'll love that.

15:09.977 --> 15:10.944
Have fun.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.713
Uh, hey, listen,
i-if you don't want to miss out,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.148
we could hit
the fish fry

15:15.182 --> 15:16.216
on the way to the wine bar.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.617
It's no big deal.
No way.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.019
It's Wade
Kinsella Night.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.687
I got a new dress
and everything.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.023
(chuckles)
Well, have fun.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.525
And I will tell the Wilkes
that you two said hi.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.460
All right.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.198
Daddy, got a minute?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.133
Oh, no, actually, I was just
getting ready to head out.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.567
I got a brand-new book
I'm dying to read...

15:34.601 --> 15:36.469
Okay, but this
is an emergency.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.238
Just tell me, which one
of these dresses says,

15:38.271 --> 15:41.674
"I'm a casual free thinker,
like the people on HBO"?

15:41.708 --> 15:44.444
HBO? Wh-What is that
supposed to even mean?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.513
I-I mean, what I know
of those people...

15:46.546 --> 15:47.514
Please, Daddy, this is urgent.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.648
ZOE:
Brick, I need you

15:48.681 --> 15:50.450
in here ASAP!
Oh, good heavens.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.951
J... Give me one minute.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.721
This dress

15:54.754 --> 15:58.025
has a turtleneck,
but this dress is floor-length.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.460
I can see that, but why
are you showing them to me?

16:00.493 --> 16:01.528
Which dress says,

16:01.561 --> 16:03.663
"I just put my feet back
in the water dating-wise,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.765
"and while I'm optimistic
that the date will go well,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.235
I won't have sex
until I'm good and ready"?

16:08.268 --> 16:09.502
You have a date?
With who?

16:09.536 --> 16:10.770
Is that your business?

16:10.803 --> 16:13.206
I'm asking you about dresses,
not whether I should date again.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.241
No, I didn't say that...

16:14.274 --> 16:15.475
Brick, just pick a dress!

16:15.508 --> 16:17.744
LEMON:
Daddy, I'm waiting.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.547
Lemon, would you... would
you come in here a moment?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.583
You both
obviously need

16:23.616 --> 16:25.752
a girlfriend to talk to,
so may I suggest

16:25.785 --> 16:27.620
that you talk to each other?

16:30.090 --> 16:32.192
No, thank you.
I'm doing great.
Not necessary. I'm peachy.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.760
But that turtleneck
will make you look Amish.
Although that blue number

16:33.793 --> 16:35.762
will make you look
like Jonah Hill.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.600
Excuse me.
I have a date.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.635
I have a date.
I have a...

16:49.809 --> 16:50.810
GEORGE: Lavon, I need you
 to close your eyes.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.744
Forget A.B.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.680
You live in a world

16:53.713 --> 16:56.216
where only
two people exist: you,

16:56.249 --> 16:58.118
Lavon Hayes,
and Alabama

16:58.151 --> 17:00.553
State Recreation Supervisor
Billy Greene.

17:00.587 --> 17:05.592
Now, you don't need anything
from Supervisor Greene.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.760
But he needs... BlueBell.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.797
And you are the answer
to his prayers.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.633
Now, I want you to say that
out loud till you believe it.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.666
(chuckles)

17:14.701 --> 17:16.269
I am the answer to his prayers.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.270
Believe it.

17:17.304 --> 17:17.837
George.

17:17.869 --> 17:18.838
George, I need you.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.073
I'm in the middle
of something.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.074
What? Who's that?
Who's there?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.142
Lavon, close
your eyes. Focus.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.644
My mother called. Magnolia
did not come home today.

17:24.676 --> 17:27.646
Okay. Well, I mean,
it is Magnolia.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.816
She's probably just out
causing mischief somewhere.

17:29.849 --> 17:30.783
Yeah, but that
is the point.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.785
I know where she is
causing the mischief,

17:32.819 --> 17:34.854
and I know who she is
causing the mischief with!

17:34.887 --> 17:37.090
And, may I say, it is
wildly inappropriate.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.692
She is in Charleston,
South Carolina,

17:39.726 --> 17:42.729
and-and she's at a party
hosted by Carter Covington.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.297
That is so creepy.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.865
Shut your eyes.
George, George,

17:45.898 --> 17:47.300
we need to go get her.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.202
Okay. Yeah, of course we do.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.338
Yeah. Oh, you know, we
should bring some snacks.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.672
It's a
seven-hour drive.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.773
Wait, what? No, no.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.176
You can't go for seven hours,
George. I need you here.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.711
Lavon, turn around. For the
last time, close your eyes.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.879
(groans)
Okay?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.215
Focus. All right,
just think about...

18:02.249 --> 18:04.717
body language and
eye contact, okay?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.719
You are gonna be fine.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.122
You are the answer
to his prayers. Say it.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.124
I am the answer
to his prayers.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.259
Yes, you are.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.861
I am the answer

18:14.894 --> 18:16.763
to his prayers.
Keep going!

18:17.897 --> 18:20.367
(playing harmonica)

18:21.768 --> 18:26.606
* Our youth was spent
desperate to see *

18:26.639 --> 18:31.211
* The things that lay
just barely underneath... *

18:31.244 --> 18:32.845
Lucy,

18:32.879 --> 18:34.747
congratulations.
Place looks amazing.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.884
Oh, Wade Kinsella,
as I live and breathe.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.220
Uh, Lucy used to be the
beer distributor over
at the Rammer Jammer.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.921
Then she started up this
fine place with her brother.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.256
Lucy, Vivian,

18:43.290 --> 18:44.891
Vivian, Lucy.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.427
Lucy also likes her
family. Go figure.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.861
Vivian, you must be
the new girlfriend

18:48.895 --> 18:50.230
I've been hearing so much about.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.232
Be careful.
There's a lot of ladies here

18:52.265 --> 18:54.434
who want to rip your hair out--
me included. (chuckles)

18:54.467 --> 18:55.802
But welcome.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.438
Drink, eat, have a blast
and tell all your friends.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.373
I got to mingle.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.275
All right.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.644
She's so cute.
(chuckles)

19:04.677 --> 19:06.879
And fun.
Hey,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.382
you know what she's not?
Vivian Wilkes.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.818
Same Vivian Wilkes I just happen
to want to dance with.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.953
What do you say?
I haven't danced with a boy

19:13.986 --> 19:15.922
who wasn't seven
in a really long time.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.390
I will take that as a yes?

19:17.424 --> 19:19.192
Yes.
All right.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.364
* As my body felt the wrath
of Father Time... *

19:24.397 --> 19:26.299
(knocking)

19:27.334 --> 19:28.901
Hey, Peter.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.937
Hi.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.210
I like you in jeans.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.878
Mmm. What smells so good?

19:38.911 --> 19:40.980
You know, pasta. Easy, casual.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.715
(chuckles)
Like me.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.184
That sounds perfect.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.823
I've been thinking
about doing that again

19:50.857 --> 19:51.991
for six months.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.726
Me, too.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.963
Oh, let me get this for you.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.465
Oh. Thank you.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.969
Nice place.
Fancy.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.405
Uh...
(chuckles)

20:05.438 --> 20:07.340
Before we get started,

20:07.374 --> 20:09.476
you just need to know
that I'm definitely not
having sex with you.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.712
Uh, my dates don't usually
start out like this.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.282
(clears throat)
I-I don't have a lot of dates.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.783
I see.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.885
Uh, usually
there's small talk:

20:18.918 --> 20:20.720
what do you do,
where are you from.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.888
Then there's this thing
I like to call eating.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.490
Okay.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.991
And then we go back
to my place for sex.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.859
What?
Kidding.
(chuckles)

20:26.893 --> 20:28.295
That was a joke.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.863
(both chuckle)

20:31.898 --> 20:33.466
Why don't we start again.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.802
Why don't you tell me
a little about yourself.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.971
Okay, um, I do not enjoy
going to the movies.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.508
Oh. Well, you know,
a lot of people are saying

20:41.541 --> 20:43.810
that television is far better
than film now.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.478
I agree.
(chuckles)
Okay.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.513
You know that show Extra?

20:46.546 --> 20:47.480
Uh, hmm?
That's good television.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.881
Maria Menounos.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.916
Incredible incisors.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.385
I'm a doctor,

20:52.419 --> 20:54.754
specializing in teeth.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.989
You mean you're a dentist.

20:57.023 --> 20:57.990
Exactly.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.927
Pretty impressive, huh?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.395
Oh, yeah.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.866
Supervisor Greene,
Chairperson Clarkson,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.835
Mr. DeSantis,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.337
thank you so much
for meeting with me.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.340
Now, as you can clearly see,
BlueBell is truly

21:13.373 --> 21:15.375
a model town.
(people chuckling)

21:15.408 --> 21:18.044
We've heard wonderful
things about BlueBell.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.513
But it might be a little
small for a county fair.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.081
Okay, the town is small--

21:22.114 --> 21:24.584
th-though not as small
as this model might suggest.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.985
(laughs)
But we have

21:26.018 --> 21:28.054
a huge sense
of community spirit.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.121
I mean, after all,

21:29.155 --> 21:31.057
what's the-the most
important thing to look for

21:31.090 --> 21:33.960
when hosting
a county fair?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.529
Well, Fairhope might say
quality rodent control.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.897
(laughs)

21:37.930 --> 21:38.698
But in BlueBell,

21:38.731 --> 21:40.833
nothing is more
important than...

21:44.437 --> 21:45.538
Mayor Hayes?

21:45.572 --> 21:46.939
...h-heart.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.341
(clears throat)

21:48.375 --> 21:50.577
Nothing is more
important than heart.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.448
Except maybe drinks.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.851
Who's up for a martini?

22:00.587 --> 22:02.555
New York?
That explains it.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.023
Explains what?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.091
The snobbishness.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.125
The whole "you're not

22:06.158 --> 22:07.960
a doctor, you're
a dentist" thing.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.028
Well, I didn't
say that.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.096
It was implied.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.531
But anyway, the
joke's on you, lady.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.532
'Cause for half
the schooling,

22:12.565 --> 22:14.967
I still bring home twice
as much of the cash-ola.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.837
So, uh, it turns out,

22:17.870 --> 22:20.006
what I'd actually asked for
were fermented beetles.

22:20.039 --> 22:20.807
Oh.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.575
So all the villagers
are watching me,

22:22.609 --> 22:25.845
and I take a bite, then another,

22:25.878 --> 22:27.380
and then I thought about you.

22:27.414 --> 22:30.450
I'm sorry, I-I remind you
of fermented beetles?

22:30.483 --> 22:31.317
No, I, uh...
(laughs)

22:31.350 --> 22:32.985
I thought about
having dinner with you,

22:33.019 --> 22:34.621
and telling
you this story,

22:34.654 --> 22:36.155
and your face lighting up,

22:36.188 --> 22:37.490
just like that.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.125
(laughs)

22:39.158 --> 22:40.427
Even if you
are a snob...

22:40.460 --> 22:41.528
(scoffs)

22:41.561 --> 22:42.895
...there is
good news.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.164
You are very
easy on the eyes.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.099
Very.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.101
Thank you?

22:49.135 --> 22:50.637
No, thank you.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.907
Peter... what is this?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.509
What do you mean?

22:56.543 --> 22:57.444
I mean,

22:57.477 --> 23:00.513
are you even gonna be
back in BlueBell?

23:00.547 --> 23:02.915
I'm here now.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.885
And after tonight?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.454
I don't know.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.155
It took me a really long time

23:09.188 --> 23:10.890
to get assigned
to the algae story.

23:10.923 --> 23:11.958
(laughs)

23:11.991 --> 23:12.792
So what do you say

23:12.825 --> 23:14.461
we take dessert
back to my place?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.062
No sex, of course.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.498
Come here.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.500
Um...

23:22.201 --> 23:23.503
I have to make a phone call.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.438
Okay. Yep.
All right.
Excuse me.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.909
Could you ex-excuse me?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.043
I need some air.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.445
Yeah.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.080
Okay.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.492
My father was right;
I do need someone to talk to.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.493
Well, so do I.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.527
Meet you at your office.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.161
Fine.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.139
Well...

24:00.172 --> 24:03.743
here we are.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.546
Yep.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.114
Yes, indeedy.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.949
So are we gonna
talk or what?

24:09.982 --> 24:11.083
I can't. I can't.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.953
Opening up to you goes against
everything I stand for.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.088
Fine. I will help.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.659
I can't help but notice
that you are not on your date.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.061
Which is very observant.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.196
Cannot help but notice

24:24.230 --> 24:26.132
that you are not
on yours, either.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.100
True.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.505
Wine. Do you have any
wine? Wine would probably

24:32.539 --> 24:34.140
really help here.
Oh, it's a great idea.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.513
Ah. Yeah, Carter
ain't picking up!

24:40.547 --> 24:42.214
Well, he is
having a party.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.517
How in the hell
did I end up surrounded

24:44.551 --> 24:47.720
by so many nutty,
irrational women?!

24:47.754 --> 24:50.256
You know, maybe
their cycles all synced up.

24:50.289 --> 24:53.593
I mean, I read a study that said
that can happen in small towns.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.528
Yeah, but Magnolia doesn't
live in BlueBell anymore...

24:55.562 --> 24:56.629
No, one minute, they're sweet,

24:56.663 --> 24:57.530
next minute,
they're running off,

24:57.564 --> 24:59.632
or they're going
on a date with-with Peter

24:59.666 --> 25:02.134
whatever-his-name-is,
and then asking you

25:02.168 --> 25:04.003
to pick out sex clothes!

25:04.036 --> 25:04.937
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Brick.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.206
Did you say
that Lemon was out on a date

25:07.239 --> 25:08.575
with Peter from Halloween?

25:08.608 --> 25:09.609
Yeah.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.743
I mean, I'm-I'm
only asking

25:10.777 --> 25:12.311
because, you know,
she said in passing

25:12.344 --> 25:13.746
that she was
through with dating.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.615
See? Totally irrational!

25:15.648 --> 25:18.585
Her behavior lately
has just been inexplicable.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.087
I mean, what does she want?
What is she looking for?

25:21.120 --> 25:22.589
Is she gonna
settle down?

25:22.622 --> 25:24.156
I wish I knew.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.328
Whoopsies.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.198
(clears throat)

25:32.231 --> 25:34.166
Where was I?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.569
You were in the middle of a
rather long list of reasons

25:36.603 --> 25:38.237
why we shouldn't hold the
county fair in Fillmore.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.305
Right!

25:39.338 --> 25:41.040
(laughs)

25:41.073 --> 25:42.642
What did...?
Did I tell you about the part

25:42.675 --> 25:43.776
where they tried
to swallow our town?

25:43.810 --> 25:45.712
Yes, twice.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.214
But maybe we should move off of
Fillmore, and you should tell us

25:48.247 --> 25:50.650
why having the fair in
BlueBell is a good idea.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.651
It's a great idea!

25:51.684 --> 25:55.121
And Gainey knows that. Huh.

25:55.154 --> 25:58.190
Yeah, that's why he decided
to mess in my head today.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.192
I bet he put

26:00.226 --> 26:01.694
his nephew up to this,

26:01.728 --> 26:04.296
just to... just to
mess with her. Me.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.765
His nephew?

26:05.798 --> 26:07.099
I have to go.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.772
WADE: What do you mean,
 I don't got dance moves?

26:12.805 --> 26:14.340
Are you kidding me?

26:14.373 --> 26:16.743
People used to call me the
white Michael Jackson. Yeah.

26:16.776 --> 26:17.877
Oh. Hey, just drink.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.812
Okay.
All right, all right.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.248
The legs
on this pinot are insane.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.083
I mean, did you
actually just...?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.685
What does that
even mean?

26:25.718 --> 26:28.120
Point is, I like the wine.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.189
And I like the company.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.357
As do I.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.591
And, let's just say,

26:32.625 --> 26:35.728
the legs on the wine aren't
the ones getting my attention.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.666
(ringtone playing)

26:42.201 --> 26:44.203
Hey, Harley, what's up?

26:45.237 --> 26:46.706
(laughs)

26:46.739 --> 26:48.340
Oh, my God!

26:48.374 --> 26:50.109
That's great.
Congratulations.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.411
I-I'm so proud
of you, baby. I...

26:52.444 --> 26:54.781
All right, go ahead. Bye.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.716
(laughs)

26:56.749 --> 26:57.850
Harley got his first hit.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.418
Two games in one day?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.387
No. Charles-- he suggested

27:01.420 --> 27:03.856
that they go to
the batting cage after dinner,

27:03.890 --> 27:05.124
and he hit one.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.426
Hey, good for him.
Kid got a hit. All right.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.128
Now, where were we?

27:09.161 --> 27:11.230
'Cause I thought it was, like,
kind of somewhere around here.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.399
You should have heard his
little voice. He was so proud.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.167
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna tell Charles

27:15.201 --> 27:17.136
to just text me
a picture real fast.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.705
All right.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.739
ZOE:
 I should have known

27:19.772 --> 27:20.740
from the bike shirt

27:20.773 --> 27:22.241
that he would be annoying,
but I told myself

27:22.274 --> 27:23.309
to get through it, right?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.211
You know, just get
the first date under your belt.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.412
But he was just so horrible.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.781
When push came to shove,
I just couldn't.

27:30.416 --> 27:31.550
My date was amazing.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.721
Peter is so funny and
thoughtful and easy to talk to,

27:34.754 --> 27:36.288
and I was so
excited to...

27:36.322 --> 27:37.389
to spend the night with him.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.258
But then he told me
that he wouldn't be back in town

27:39.291 --> 27:41.260
for a really long time, and
then something inside of me

27:41.293 --> 27:42.929
just snapped, and I couldn't.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.299
Well, duh.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.300
Excuse me?

27:48.334 --> 27:49.101
Of course you couldn't,

27:49.135 --> 27:50.770
'cause you knew
sleeping with a man

27:50.803 --> 27:51.938
who was leaving
would be stupid.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.774
Did you just
call me stupid?

27:54.807 --> 27:56.275
You're Lemon Breeland.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.178
Everybody knows that you believe
in love and happily ever after.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.380
So, you stopped yourself
from sleeping with Peter

28:01.413 --> 28:02.915
because he was just
another detour.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.751
Another detour?
No offense,

28:04.784 --> 28:07.286
but Meatball, Enrique,
Carter Covington--

28:07.319 --> 28:09.722
I mean, were any of those
roads to happiness?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.924
(scoffs)
Shut up.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.393
I'm glad
that you are not my friend,

28:14.426 --> 28:15.427
because you are terrible at it.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.296
Oh, and I suppose
you got a real knack for it?

28:17.329 --> 28:19.766
I do. And I will
prove it to you.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.368
Because if I were your
girlfriend, which I am not,

28:22.401 --> 28:24.937
I would have told you
that going out on a date

28:24.971 --> 28:26.238
three weeks
after breaking up

28:26.272 --> 28:28.941
from the longest relationship
of your entire life is moronic.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.977
No, don't hold back.
Tell me how you really feel.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.779
And you shouldn't have
to sit there and listen

28:32.812 --> 28:33.846
to some blowhard
talk about dentistry

28:33.880 --> 28:35.014
just to prove a point
to yourself.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.515
You should go back there
and tell that guy

28:36.548 --> 28:38.250
to shove that bicycle
right up his keister.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.754
You make a decent point.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.257
Yours wasn't so awful, either.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.900
Hey. There you are.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.835
I've been looking for you.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.870
Oh. Sorry.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.372
My entire family wanted
to talk about the big hit.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.841
Charles keeps
sending me pictures.

29:01.874 --> 29:05.377
Oh, my God, is that Uncle Ned
doing handsprings?

29:05.411 --> 29:07.346
Can't be good
for his plastic hip.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.381
I think that they're all
as excited as Harley.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.350
The whole family went out
to SkeeBall & Stuff

29:11.383 --> 29:13.352
to celebrate. See?

29:13.385 --> 29:15.021
I see.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.527
Look, Viv, I think it's great
that Harley got this hit,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.463
but why is Charles sending you
all these pictures

29:24.496 --> 29:26.265
and videos right now?

29:26.298 --> 29:28.567
I mean, aren't they gonna be
just as great tomorrow?

29:28.600 --> 29:31.804
No, he just... he knows
that I wouldn't want to miss it.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.007
There's no ulterior motive
or anything,

29:35.041 --> 29:37.043
if that's what you're thinking.

29:37.076 --> 29:40.512
Right. Right.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.381
No, I'm...

29:42.414 --> 29:44.917
I'm sorry,
and I'm-I'm sorry you missed it.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.418
No, it's fine.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.720
I'm a single working mother;
I miss everything.

29:52.591 --> 29:56.863
Well, why don't you go meet them
for ice cream.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.298
I can see
that you want to go, and,

29:59.331 --> 30:01.500
honestly, we-we can
do this anytime.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.335
Really?

30:03.369 --> 30:04.503
Yeah.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.338
Are you sure you won't be mad?

30:06.372 --> 30:08.307
Not at all.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.575
Thank you.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.079
Mmm.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.113
You're amazing.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.915
Oh, I know.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.950
Yeah.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.092
(doorbell rings)

30:29.996 --> 30:31.964
Dr. Breeland, George.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.599
This is a surprise.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.967
Pajamas?

30:35.001 --> 30:37.069
What the hell kind of a party
is this?

30:37.103 --> 30:38.938
Where is she?

30:38.971 --> 30:40.639
What party, and who?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.041
Magnolia. Brick believes...

30:42.074 --> 30:43.943
I believe my teenage daughter
was invited

30:43.976 --> 30:46.078
to a party at your house, sir!

30:46.112 --> 30:48.514
And you did hear the part
where I said "teenage"?

30:48.547 --> 30:49.615
Right?
GEORGE:
Yes, Brick.

30:49.648 --> 30:50.950
He heard that.
Yeah.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.151
There's no party here.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.585
Yeah, I don't believe you.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.422
GEORGE: Brick, there...
there is no party here.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.392
You haven't heard from her?

31:00.426 --> 31:02.428
Well, I did get an Evite
from her yesterday,

31:02.461 --> 31:04.931
but I thought I made it
on the list by mistake.

31:04.964 --> 31:09.468
"Magnolia's Annual
Daddy is Away Kegger"?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.637
"B.Y.O.B."

31:11.670 --> 31:14.040
Unbelievable.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.975
You do have to kind of
admire the brain

31:16.008 --> 31:17.910
that can come up
with a plan like that.

31:17.944 --> 31:21.914
I... have sired
an evil genius.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.983
Two, kind of.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.084
Yeah.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.552
Yeah.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.655
Oh, good, you're still here.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.423
I thought you might have left.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.126
I only waited 'cause I wanted
the chance to say to your face:

31:34.160 --> 31:35.527
you are very rude.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.496
Well, I'm glad
that you waited.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.764
You left me alone
on a date for an hour.

31:38.797 --> 31:41.467
I've been getting pity stares
from all the other customers.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.701
I don't get pity stares.
I'm a catch.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.571
You know you have
a very overblown

31:45.604 --> 31:47.106
sense of yourself, right?

31:47.139 --> 31:48.340
No, no, I think
it's blown just right.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.477
I'm handsome, have well-defined
calves from all the cycling,

31:51.510 --> 31:52.678
I am a doctor...

31:52.711 --> 31:55.014
No, no,
you are a dentist, okay?!

31:55.047 --> 31:56.548
And I'm sure you do

31:56.582 --> 31:58.684
a very good job... with teeth!

31:58.717 --> 32:00.186
But I'm a doctor!

32:00.219 --> 32:01.687
I am a doctor!

32:01.720 --> 32:04.423
What you do and what I do,
not even remotely similar!

32:04.456 --> 32:06.025
Whoa.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.194
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

32:09.228 --> 32:10.963
No!

32:19.605 --> 32:21.707
You're still here.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.709
Yeah, well, I figured
you'd be back.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.544
You live here and all.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.047
(chuckles)

32:28.080 --> 32:31.050
Peter, I don't know

32:31.083 --> 32:33.519
what's been going on
with me lately,

32:33.552 --> 32:37.589
but although there's been
much, much

32:37.623 --> 32:41.760
evidence to the contrary,
I'm looking for something real

32:41.793 --> 32:45.064
and something
with a future.

32:45.097 --> 32:48.734
And you can't give that
to me, can you?

32:52.638 --> 32:55.607
You are an amazing woman,
Lemon Breeland.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.209
And I have to say

32:57.243 --> 32:59.645
you nearly make me
want to change.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.248
Just get a white
picket fence, a dog,

33:02.281 --> 33:04.550
the whole deal.

33:04.583 --> 33:08.120
The important word
there is, um...

33:08.154 --> 33:09.188
"nearly."

33:09.221 --> 33:11.490
Yeah.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.025
I'm sorry.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.208
* 'Cause if you wanted
me to stay *

33:29.241 --> 33:31.810
* Why did you shuffle
out the door? *

33:31.843 --> 33:35.814
* And if you wanted me to go,
why would... *

33:35.847 --> 33:38.250
What happened
to your lady friend?

33:38.284 --> 33:40.586
Oh, uh, she had to go.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.121
Well, that's too bad.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.556
But seeing as
you're all alone...

33:44.590 --> 33:46.758
after-party, my place?

33:46.792 --> 33:49.261
Uh, yeah, you know,

33:49.295 --> 33:52.198
I-I'm not really
that guy anymore.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.101
Well, you know where to find me
if that guy shows up.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.170
All right. (chuckles)

34:03.309 --> 34:04.576
Hey, Viv.

34:04.610 --> 34:08.547
Uh, hope your night was good,
that you had fun.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.817
Uh... call me back.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.284
Yeah.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.197
Lavon?

34:25.231 --> 34:27.299
Oh.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.168
You smell like a bar.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.569
(slurring):
No, I'm here to warn you.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.570
You know, your new boyfriend?

34:31.603 --> 34:32.737
Bad news.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.739
Oh, really?

34:33.772 --> 34:35.574
And how do you know that?

34:35.607 --> 34:37.176
(sputters)

34:37.208 --> 34:39.110
A, he's a Gainey.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.212
Mm.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.581
And B...

34:42.614 --> 34:43.715
he's a Gainey!

34:43.748 --> 34:46.351
What-what other evidence
do you need?

34:46.385 --> 34:48.353
They're all liars and cheats!

34:48.387 --> 34:50.589
This is truly sad.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.257
Well, come on, A.B.!

34:52.291 --> 34:55.194
I mean, this-this guy
just happened to turn up

34:55.226 --> 34:57.796
out of the blue,
right before I give my pitch

34:57.829 --> 34:58.897
for the county fair?

34:58.930 --> 35:03.702
So, you came to my house
to tell me my new boyfriend

35:03.735 --> 35:05.804
is only with me
as part of a plot

35:05.837 --> 35:09.241
to ruin your bid
for county fair?

35:09.275 --> 35:12.878
It couldn't be that he finds me
smart or interesting

35:12.911 --> 35:14.380
or attractive?

35:14.413 --> 35:16.282
No, no, no.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.184
I'm trying to protect you.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.618
No, you're not!

35:19.651 --> 35:22.354
You're being
a jealous ex-boyfriend.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.755
And the fact that

35:23.789 --> 35:26.392
you would do that after
everything you put me through...

35:29.295 --> 35:31.230
There are no words.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.265
Just go home, Lavon.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.954
Wanda, a gigantic
coffee please.

35:55.987 --> 35:59.658
You want to get
that to go, Lavon?

35:59.691 --> 36:02.794
People may not want
to see you just yet.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.364
(slaps back)
(groans)

36:05.397 --> 36:06.365
Hey, Lavon.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.799
I just, uh, found out

36:07.833 --> 36:09.701
that Daphne got
the county fair.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.203
I was wondering
what happened.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.170
Well, well!

36:12.204 --> 36:14.206
Should've known better
than to put all our eggs

36:14.240 --> 36:16.808
in your incapable
basket, Mayor Hayes.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.310
I hear he got drunk
at the meeting.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.279
(laughs) Sergeant Jeffries,
that's ridiculous.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.480
He-he would
never do that.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.681
Except I did.

36:22.714 --> 36:26.352
My Ruby would've gotten us
the county fair.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.820
She loves the tilt-a-whirl.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.258
Lavon...

36:32.291 --> 36:33.959
It gets worse.

36:33.992 --> 36:37.929
I have a vague memory of going
to AnnaBeth's and telling her

36:37.963 --> 36:40.732
she was being duped
by some sort of Gainey plot.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.301
Oh, Lavon.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.471
Uh, excuse me.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.273
Sure.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.341
AnnaBeth,

36:49.375 --> 36:51.843
I am so...

36:51.877 --> 36:53.379
No.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.848
We have nothing
to say to each other.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.929
You actually have to put
that broom on the floor

37:10.962 --> 37:13.399
for it to work.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.933
This isn't what it looks like.

37:14.966 --> 37:15.934
Really?

37:15.967 --> 37:19.271
I'll tell you...

37:19.305 --> 37:23.008
what it looks like
is that you set me up

37:23.041 --> 37:25.477
to go to Charleston
to chase you down

37:25.511 --> 37:29.848
while you were here
having a huge party

37:29.881 --> 37:31.883
in my house.

37:34.453 --> 37:37.356
Well, go ahead.

37:37.389 --> 37:40.359
Let me have it, because
any punishment you dream up

37:40.392 --> 37:42.428
cannot be worse
than life at Grandma's.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.030
Yeah, that is probably true.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.766
Magnolia,

37:47.799 --> 37:50.469
my dream for you

37:50.502 --> 37:53.972
is that you grow into a...

37:54.005 --> 37:56.975
responsible, well-adjusted

37:57.008 --> 37:59.878
young woman.

37:59.911 --> 38:03.048
But I'll be satisfied
if you just...

38:03.081 --> 38:05.517
finish high school
without getting arrested

38:05.551 --> 38:07.519
or pregnant, but things are
not looking good right now.

38:07.553 --> 38:09.020
Daddy...

38:09.054 --> 38:11.823
Put yourself in my shoes.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.425
A worried father

38:13.459 --> 38:17.363
who only wants the best
for his beautiful girl.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.334
Tell me, what-what do I do
with you?

38:24.002 --> 38:26.405
Find me another boarding school.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.906
Away from Grandma.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.941
And visit me
every weekend to make sure

38:29.975 --> 38:32.110
that I'm doing things right
this time.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.446
And I will certainly try.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.550
Okay.

38:38.584 --> 38:41.387
I'll make some calls.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.358
Hey, George.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.959
You look terrible.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.461
Oh, well, thank you

38:49.495 --> 38:50.462
for that.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.630
How was your night?

38:51.663 --> 38:53.999
Um...

38:54.032 --> 38:55.967
it was a mess.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.471
I saw Peter and realized it was
never gonna happen for us,

38:59.505 --> 39:00.972
so...

39:01.006 --> 39:03.609
Oh. Well, I am...
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.978
Uh... you want to
maybe go get breakfast

39:07.012 --> 39:09.448
and talk about it
before we do the books?

39:09.481 --> 39:11.583
Actually, I already did the
books. I-I couldn't sleep, so...

39:11.617 --> 39:12.851
I got up early.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.854
Oh. Oh. Well, that is...
that is great news.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.957
I-I didn't want
to do those anyway, so...

39:18.990 --> 39:20.125
And AnnaBeth has
finally reemerged,

39:20.158 --> 39:21.860
so I'm gonna go have breakfast
with her.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.596
Will you finish
inventory for me?

39:24.630 --> 39:26.532
Yeah, sure.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.633
No problem.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.034
Thanks.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.911
(Vivian and Charles chuckling)

39:41.012 --> 39:42.881
What's he...

39:42.914 --> 39:45.884
Wade, I-I didn't
expect... Um...
Hi.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.919
Charles slept on the couch.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.088
Yeah. Well, we had a little
too much wine last night, so...

39:50.121 --> 39:51.990
I couldn't drive.
Huh.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.158
Anyway, we'll, uh,

39:53.191 --> 39:54.192
talk later?

39:54.225 --> 39:57.095
Yes.
All right.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.930
See you, Wade.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.133
He stayed here?

40:02.167 --> 40:03.602
It wasn't a big deal.

40:03.635 --> 40:07.072
Okay. Um...

40:07.105 --> 40:09.675
I missed you last night.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.543
Me, too.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.514
Harley's probably hungry.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.715
I should go and...

40:16.748 --> 40:19.017
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

40:19.050 --> 40:20.218
I'll call you later.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.621
Great idea.
I'll talk to you then.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.456
All right.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.637
A.B.

40:38.670 --> 40:39.638
Is that really you?

40:39.671 --> 40:41.072
In the flesh.
(chuckles)

40:41.106 --> 40:42.073
Where have you been?

40:42.107 --> 40:43.642
So much has happened.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.677
I had a disastrous date.

40:45.711 --> 40:48.680
But it led me to realize
that I need to move on.

40:48.714 --> 40:53.018
So... I am selling
the new house.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.221
Well, I say
good for you.

40:56.254 --> 40:59.224
Um, and speaking of moving on...

40:59.257 --> 41:00.726
I met someone.

41:00.759 --> 41:02.528
That's where
I've been.
What?

41:02.561 --> 41:03.762
Spill.
Okay.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.964
Well... Lemon.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.265
"For sale." Hmm.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.768
Well, that's one way
to put yourself out there.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.603
Personally, I would've gone for
something a little more subtle.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.138
Maybe "lease to own."

41:13.171 --> 41:14.573
Hilarious.
(chuckles)

41:14.606 --> 41:17.142
Um, Zoe, Lemon and I have plans,

41:17.175 --> 41:19.044
but maybe I could
fill you in later?

41:19.077 --> 41:20.178
Oh. Yeah, sure.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.781
It's okay. She can stay.

41:27.018 --> 41:30.589
Well, A.B. was just about to
tell me about her new boyfriend.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.658
No way! Who is it?

41:32.691 --> 41:35.994
Well, there was this patient,

41:36.027 --> 41:38.229
and he kept coming into
the office. I knew...

41:38.263 --> 41:41.266
