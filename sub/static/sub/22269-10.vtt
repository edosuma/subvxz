WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:07.340
<i>And so
the prophecy was fulfilled,</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:10.135
<i>and everyone in Wendimoor
lived happily ever--</i>

00:10.136 --> 00:13.680
Not this time!
This is my story now!

00:13.681 --> 00:15.640
<i>There once
was a very special princess</i>

00:15.641 --> 00:17.517
<i>who no one appreciated.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:20.186
<i>She was married to a slob,
and her son was an idiot.</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.896
<i>She had a terrible accident</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:23.982
<i>that wasn't her fault
even a little bit,</i>

00:23.983 --> 00:26.359
<i>and ended up lost and alone.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.904
<i>But then a wonderful wizard
from another world came</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:34.451
<i>and gave her another chance
to live the perfect life she deserved!</i>

00:34.452 --> 00:36.536
<i>And so the princess
became a beautiful queen</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:37.787
<i>who everyone loved,</i>

00:37.788 --> 00:40.541
<i>and lived happily ever after.</i>

00:41.751 --> 00:43.127
Or else.

01:08.444 --> 01:10.528
Oh, shit.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.906
Tina, are you alive?

01:13.532 --> 01:14.783
Hobbs?

01:14.784 --> 01:16.077
Are you back?

01:17.369 --> 01:18.203
Hi, Tina.

01:18.204 --> 01:21.957
Oh, my God, Hobbs, you're alive!

01:23.042 --> 01:24.584
Why are we in the quarry?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.295
Did something explode?

01:27.505 --> 01:28.379
Yeah.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.839
Phew!

01:29.840 --> 01:32.634
No, no. We've all been shot,

01:32.635 --> 01:34.552
several...

01:35.471 --> 01:36.805
many times...

01:36.806 --> 01:38.473
Aw, dang, that's true.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.059
Who shot us? Who shot us?

01:41.060 --> 01:42.519
You!

01:42.520 --> 01:44.479
You shot both of us.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.024
Tina, you also shot me once.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.943
I shot you once, and you twice.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.778
Why were we all shooting each other?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.363
The Mage made us do it.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.448
Why didn't anybody shoot the frickin' Mage?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.950
Hobbs, be cool, man, be cool.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.493
The first thing we need to do

01:58.494 --> 01:59.953
is put pressure on the wounds.

01:59.954 --> 02:00.829
Okay.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.790
<i>Use your belts, tie them tight.</i>

02:03.499 --> 02:06.000
Can either of you see your intestines?

02:06.001 --> 02:07.877
Are you having trouble breathing?

02:07.878 --> 02:09.045
Nope.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.130
No intestines.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.007
We don't have that much time.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.885
We have to get help very quickly,

02:15.886 --> 02:17.513
or we will die.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.226
I'm gonna go get the truck...

02:24.687 --> 02:26.230
and pick you both up.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.776
<i>You got it, girl.</i>

02:31.777 --> 02:32.945
Go, Farah.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.077
Guys...

02:41.078 --> 02:43.080
I don't think this plan's gonna work.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.220
Okay, but...

02:59.221 --> 03:00.222
you?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.765
Why would the dog be--

03:02.766 --> 03:04.268
You know what, I can't.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.687
Whoa!

03:07.688 --> 03:08.646
Shh!

03:08.647 --> 03:10.982
Okay, okay...
Okay, I can do this.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.358
I can do this--

03:12.359 --> 03:13.694
No, I can't, okay...

03:18.324 --> 03:19.199
No, no, no, no!

03:19.200 --> 03:20.658
Project Icarus, did you do this?

03:20.659 --> 03:21.784
Do what? What did I do?

03:21.785 --> 03:23.578
The facility is in chaos!

03:23.579 --> 03:24.746
There are knights!

03:24.747 --> 03:26.080
Knights everywhere!

03:26.081 --> 03:27.749
Ah, yes, actually,
I do know about that,

03:27.750 --> 03:29.292
and that actually probably is my bad--

03:29.293 --> 03:30.877
- It is?!
- Or no,

03:30.878 --> 03:33.463
or whatever answer's gonna make you
stop pointing that gun and listen to me.

03:33.464 --> 03:34.797
I can end this,

03:34.798 --> 03:36.841
but only if you take me
to Project Moloch.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.218
You are a Blackwing subject.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.928
I do not take orders from you--

03:39.929 --> 03:40.762
Ouch!

03:40.763 --> 03:41.763
Fire at will!

03:41.764 --> 03:43.098
Move!

03:46.727 --> 03:47.685
Aw, Jesus...

03:47.686 --> 03:49.604
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.272
Listen, Mister...

03:51.273 --> 03:52.565
Assistent?!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.441
God, I hate Blackwing!

03:53.442 --> 03:54.776
Why did I even take this job!

03:54.777 --> 03:58.238
My boss is an idiot,
like, so dumb,

03:58.239 --> 04:01.199
and now we're gonna
get killed by knights?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.575
I thought "top secret" meant

04:02.576 --> 04:04.995
that I was gonna
get to meet aliens, man!

04:05.454 --> 04:06.329
Snap into it!

04:06.330 --> 04:09.332
I'm here, and I'm not panicking,
so that means you can't panic either.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.208
You have a head injury,

04:10.209 --> 04:11.668
so I'm sorry if this
loud voice I'm speaking in--

04:11.669 --> 04:13.753
and all of this-- is making it worse,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.296
but we don't have time to waste!

04:15.297 --> 04:18.425
To fix this, we need
to get to Project Moloch now!

04:50.708 --> 04:51.917
Wh...

04:52.626 --> 04:54.003
Wh-what happened?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.588
The pain was too much, so...

04:57.589 --> 05:00.633
I... I took us out of our bodies.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.510
You can do that?

05:02.511 --> 05:04.096
Apparently, yeah.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.559
What is this place?

05:10.144 --> 05:14.188
I guess it's what's
behind... everything?

05:14.189 --> 05:16.984
It's like the backstage of reality.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.572
I've see this in my visions before,
but I've never been here.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.782
Wow.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.830
Yeah.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.044
Drugs.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.637
What's that sound?

05:59.693 --> 06:00.610
Todd?

06:01.779 --> 06:03.029
Stay with me.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.491
The pain is going to try
to pull you back into your body,

06:06.492 --> 06:08.076
but trust me,

06:08.077 --> 06:09.912
you don't wanna be there
right now.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.792
What happens if Suzi arrives
while we're still here?

06:15.793 --> 06:18.879
I think that would probably be bad.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.964
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

06:21.965 --> 06:22.965
We're both gonna die, man!

06:22.966 --> 06:25.009
Well, perhaps, but I'm trying
not to think about that.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.637
Okay, uh...
perhaps this door, then.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.430
That's not Moloch's chamber!

06:29.431 --> 06:31.432
Going where I'm going
without knowing how I'm knowing

06:31.433 --> 06:32.558
is sort of my whole thing,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.852
and there were kind of a lot of people
killing each other that way,

06:34.853 --> 06:35.895
so let us in here!

06:35.896 --> 06:37.773
That's a secure room!

06:38.148 --> 06:39.857
Open it.

06:39.858 --> 06:40.943
Now.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.072
Hey, freeze! Drop your weapons!

06:46.073 --> 06:47.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.366
Hi, Dirk!

06:48.367 --> 06:49.576
Mona?!

06:50.452 --> 06:51.495
Down, now.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.419
You guys smell that?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.421
It's weird.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.881
I don't like it, man,
it smells like burning.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.591
We stop her here,

07:05.592 --> 07:07.552
before she gets to the Drummer

07:07.553 --> 07:09.262
and her brother.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.183
No, I don't like this.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.726
No, no, no, no, no.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.437
I've got ants in my pants.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.022
What's so funny?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.732
Why is she laughing?

07:21.733 --> 07:24.193
This is why we were brought here.

07:24.194 --> 07:28.698
This goofy bad-news voodoo mama
ain't got nothin' on us.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.993
Sticks and stones.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.245
Protesto!

07:35.456 --> 07:39.542
You rats think
that you can defeat me?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.503
Feeding time, boys.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.809
Vraxis.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.917
Aah!

08:25.339 --> 08:26.714
Dirk!

08:26.715 --> 08:29.342
- Oh!
- You came to save me!

08:30.594 --> 08:32.845
They said you were in trouble?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.181
Well, yes, I definitely
have been in trouble, Mona.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.309
I've been trying to find The Boy!

08:37.726 --> 08:41.062
Is that where you went
when you went through the bed?

08:41.939 --> 08:43.856
Mona, might I be so rude
as to inquire,

08:43.857 --> 08:45.566
when you said "Find The Boy,"

08:45.567 --> 08:48.319
you didn't happen to know
he was in Blackwing

08:48.320 --> 08:49.529
the whole time?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.657
No, I didn't know that.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.200
I was just trying to help

08:54.201 --> 08:57.453
the cute little snail
that talks in my head.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.915
Right, that's great.
You did great work for that...

09:00.916 --> 09:01.791
snail?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.251
Did you find The Boy?

09:03.252 --> 09:05.419
Yes. Yes, I did, and he's here,

09:05.420 --> 09:07.172
and this man
is going to take us to him.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.091
Moloch is in the East Wing.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.260
We'll never make it.
This place is a war zone!

09:12.261 --> 09:13.261
"You'll never make it!

09:13.262 --> 09:15.096
This place is a war zone!"

09:16.056 --> 09:17.014
We'll never make it.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.475
This place is a war zone!
Can you help?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.560
Of course.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.104
I can get you there really, really fast.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.105
Excellent!

09:24.106 --> 09:25.524
Okay, just one thing...

09:25.941 --> 09:28.360
can you turn into a bug?

09:29.528 --> 09:31.654
Only emotionally.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.447
Okay,

09:33.448 --> 09:35.283
then we'll try something else.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.044
Alakazaam!

09:59.141 --> 10:02.518
Face my wrath, you insect.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.270
Die at the hand

10:04.271 --> 10:06.981
of the most powerful creature

10:06.982 --> 10:10.569
in the universe!

10:11.820 --> 10:12.904
Toros.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.078
Enough.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.997
Enough of this!

10:22.998 --> 10:24.874
Who are you?

10:24.875 --> 10:27.627
Like, seriously,
what is your problem?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.378
Why are you here?

10:29.379 --> 10:32.465
You're, like,
some mom from Montana?

10:32.466 --> 10:35.134
I don't understand
why you're involved,

10:35.135 --> 10:36.677
literally, at all.

10:36.678 --> 10:37.553
<i>No one does!</i>

10:37.554 --> 10:40.640
You're just like
this psycho crazy person

10:40.641 --> 10:43.225
who's screwing up everything
for everyone!

10:43.226 --> 10:45.936
You have killed so many people.

10:45.937 --> 10:49.398
Do you have any conception
of what is going on,

10:49.399 --> 10:51.068
or what you're even doing?

10:52.569 --> 10:54.987
I have this now.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.905
This...

10:55.906 --> 10:58.532
has given me a second chance.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.827
It's helped me fix
everything that's broken.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.913
I'm taking control of my life.

11:03.914 --> 11:07.124
Taking control of your life
is about changing you,

11:07.125 --> 11:08.626
not everything else.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.670
It isn't some instant magic wand

11:10.671 --> 11:12.213
that you can just wave around

11:12.214 --> 11:14.924
and make everything
the way you want it.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.467
Maybe you're right, then.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.553
Maybe I am a bad person.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.640
But it's so much more fun
than being good all the time.

11:22.641 --> 11:23.724
Wait.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.185
Why are we even talking?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.604
Why haven't you killed me yet?

11:28.271 --> 11:29.939
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
your wand is messed up!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.524
Your wand is messed up!
Ooh, ooh!

11:31.525 --> 11:32.358
No... No, Barabat--

11:57.217 --> 11:59.301
Wow...

12:01.763 --> 12:03.056
I can't believe--

12:03.515 --> 12:05.225
This ends now.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.563
You really think
you can turn into something

12:10.564 --> 12:12.274
faster than I can pull this trigger?

12:13.608 --> 12:16.444
Oh, I understand now.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.404
You're the bad one.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.822
No, I'm not!

12:19.823 --> 12:21.657
That'd be a much more
compelling position

12:21.658 --> 12:23.159
if you weren't pointing
a gun to my head.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.034
I can't let you go,

12:24.035 --> 12:26.370
'cause then you'll just
disappear again

12:26.371 --> 12:27.914
and make me look like an idiot!

12:28.749 --> 12:30.750
Everybody thinks that I'm an idiot!

12:30.751 --> 12:33.461
Even I maybe think
that I might be an idiot!

12:33.462 --> 12:34.920
Look, the only way to end this

12:34.921 --> 12:37.047
is to return Project Moloch
to Wendimoor.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.759
That's why all of this is happening.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.720
Oh, God...

12:43.013 --> 12:44.597
It is him.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.266
Ken was right.

12:50.604 --> 12:55.024
It's because he had that stroke

12:55.025 --> 12:57.443
when I brought him here.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.237
This is all my fault.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.783
<i>Why am I always wrong?</i>

13:03.909 --> 13:06.035
I just...

13:06.036 --> 13:08.830
I want to be right for once.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.626
It's all so complicated.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.254
Wait...

13:17.255 --> 13:19.174
Am I the villain?

13:20.509 --> 13:22.301
Am I, like, the bad guy,

13:22.302 --> 13:26.430
but I'm just so stupid
that I didn't even notice?

13:26.431 --> 13:29.184
It's not just you, Mr. Friedkin.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.647
The problem is Blackwing.

13:34.648 --> 13:39.610
The attempts to build a cage
around the utterly uncontainable

13:39.611 --> 13:41.696
have only caused more bloodshed.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.866
Don't blow this.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.410
This is your chance

13:48.411 --> 13:50.538
to make things right.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.098
I can't let you go.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.976
You're the problem, not me.

14:11.977 --> 14:14.854
Do you really believe that?

14:14.855 --> 14:18.941
What's more important, Mr. Friedkin,

14:18.942 --> 14:21.110
being in charge,

14:21.111 --> 14:23.321
or doing the right thing?

14:26.741 --> 14:29.578
Is this a trick question?

14:30.453 --> 14:32.162
No.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.971
Clear!

14:50.098 --> 14:52.142
There's more coming, more coming!

14:55.437 --> 14:57.354
There's no time for more fighting!

14:57.355 --> 14:59.190
Let's go, let's go!

15:08.199 --> 15:09.158
Oh no.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.159
What? What's wrong?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.201
The portal's gone.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.578
- Is that--
- Bad.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.290
That's very bad.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.250
Amanda, come on,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.418
you're okay...

15:19.419 --> 15:20.544
What happened?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.171
Hey!

15:22.172 --> 15:23.422
Sis!

15:23.423 --> 15:25.132
Oh, my God.

15:25.133 --> 15:25.966
Man, I'm messed up.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.551
We need to reopen the portal, okay?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.637
Wait, what happened to that
evil bitch with the wand?

15:29.638 --> 15:30.763
Is she dead?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.933
No.

15:33.934 --> 15:34.934
Come on...

15:34.935 --> 15:36.685
Open the gate.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.145
Just find a way.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.063
I'll cover you.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.397
Cover me? Todd, she'll kill you.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.233
Do it now, or we all die.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.495
No... No!

15:54.496 --> 15:55.956
No, no, no, no!

15:57.165 --> 15:58.999
What is going on?
What's wrong?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.085
There is supposed to be a portal here!

16:01.086 --> 16:03.545
Oh, no, something must've happened.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.672
Well, we have to do something!

16:11.096 --> 16:14.516
Dirk Gently dies,
and the prophecy is over!

16:20.563 --> 16:22.564
You? The...

16:22.565 --> 16:24.192
Bart... guy?

16:25.443 --> 16:28.697
Dirk, this is bad.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.701
You guys aren't going anywhere.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.620
This is Supervisor Adams.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.289
Lock this room down, Priority Ten!

16:39.290 --> 16:40.417
Now!

16:42.419 --> 16:43.544
No, no, no!

16:44.671 --> 16:47.339
Nafraya stupid baboon!

16:56.516 --> 16:58.350
Amanda, open the portal now!

17:02.188 --> 17:04.941
I won't let you ruin this for me!

17:13.825 --> 17:14.826
No...

17:19.914 --> 17:21.582
Ken, listen to me,

17:21.583 --> 17:24.376
you have no idea
what is going on here.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.879
Don't you condescend to me, Svlad,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.088
you fast-talking freak.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.507
You don't even understand
your abilities.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.135
You wander through
out-of-control situations

17:33.136 --> 17:35.846
fumbling everything you touch!

17:35.847 --> 17:39.600
But if you're here now,
there's a chance

17:39.601 --> 17:41.518
that this is where
you're meant to stay,

17:41.519 --> 17:43.020
and I'll be damned

17:43.021 --> 17:46.523
if I'm letting
the debug function of reality

17:46.524 --> 17:48.193
walk out on my watch!

17:49.277 --> 17:50.778
Then...

17:50.779 --> 17:52.530
you won't kill me.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.700
No.

17:57.911 --> 17:58.827
But...

18:07.504 --> 18:10.297
Reinforcements will be here soon.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.132
This facility is under control.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.676
You, don't move.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.387
I'm on your side!

18:27.732 --> 18:29.109
Avaratos.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.863
Avaratos!

18:36.199 --> 18:37.534
Avaratos.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.128
No...

18:49.879 --> 18:52.172
I think I must be going.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.175
My friends are waiting for me.

18:54.759 --> 18:58.804
Don't move. I swear to God,
I will shoot you in your other leg!

18:58.805 --> 18:59.806
No.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.064
You moron, drop that now.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.482
You can't control it.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.650
That's not how it works.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.152
Shut up, Hugo.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.028
You can only make it worse,
you can't fix anything.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.697
Svlad, Svlad!

19:16.698 --> 19:18.365
I will shoot you!

19:18.366 --> 19:19.826
You shoot him, and I shoot you!

19:25.331 --> 19:27.541
Todd?

19:27.542 --> 19:29.502
Keep the portal open.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.588
Don't do it!

19:32.589 --> 19:34.673
Dirk...

19:34.674 --> 19:35.549
Go.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.550
Now!

19:36.551 --> 19:38.261
Don't move!

19:53.109 --> 19:56.028
No! No!

19:56.029 --> 19:57.780
Bye bye, now.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.186
Todd?

20:37.820 --> 20:38.905
Toro--

20:41.157 --> 20:43.075
Rise and shine.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.460
Todd, please tell me you're okay.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.303
Are you The Boy?

21:03.304 --> 21:05.347
I don't remember you.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.267
Are you a bad guy or a good guy?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.434
Good guy?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.852
- The bad guy! So bad--
- The main bad guy--

21:10.853 --> 21:12.354
Bad guy! She's the worst!

21:12.355 --> 21:14.231
I'll rip you to pieces,
you little piece of--

21:29.956 --> 21:31.123
Did we win?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.583
Who... Who won?

21:34.544 --> 21:35.961
Dirk!

21:35.962 --> 21:36.962
It's him!

21:36.963 --> 21:38.297
It's actually him!

21:38.298 --> 21:40.507
You did it! What? How?

21:40.508 --> 21:42.302
Bit of a team effort, really.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.554
Oh, my god, what
happened to your leg?

21:45.555 --> 21:46.888
Oh.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.348
Wait a second,
what happened to--

21:48.349 --> 21:50.726
Todd, can we not right now?

21:50.727 --> 21:51.601
That's The Boy.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.855
Francis. My name is Francis.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.232
Thanks for bringing me back, Dirk.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.067
I'm sorry it was so confusing.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.152
No, that's...

22:01.821 --> 22:02.946
That's quite all right.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.032
It was hard for me
to see things clearly

22:05.033 --> 22:07.117
while I was in the big sleep.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.036
I couldn't make anything new,

22:09.037 --> 22:10.913
couldn't change anything.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.415
I just knew if I could get here,

22:13.416 --> 22:14.875
I would wake up.

22:14.876 --> 22:16.960
Sorry your world got so screwed up.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.503
It's okay.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.756
I can fix all this.

22:20.757 --> 22:23.216
<i>Wendimoor will be perfect.</i>

22:23.217 --> 22:24.343
Wh-what about The Mage?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.094
The Mage!

22:26.095 --> 22:27.971
Oh, my God,
totally forgot about him!

22:27.972 --> 22:29.806
Oh, we need to stop him, we--

22:29.807 --> 22:31.558
The Mage is dead.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.517
Dead?

22:32.518 --> 22:35.145
Your friends back home
already stopped him.

22:35.146 --> 22:38.648
Who could possibly stop
a super-powerful Dark Wizard?

22:38.649 --> 22:39.649
- Farah.
- Farah.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.902
Farah. I knew it before we said it.

22:41.903 --> 22:44.446
But now, she needs your help.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.781
Why? Wh-what--

22:45.782 --> 22:47.366
I'll send you back with a gift.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.285
It'll be the last thing
I make in the old world.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.080
<i>Thank you for your help, stranger.</i>

22:56.292 --> 22:58.835
<i>Your friends, the Rowdy 3, are okay.</i>

22:58.836 --> 23:01.505
But I suppose they'll want
their special car back.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.840
What about me?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.801
I still have things to learn here.

23:05.802 --> 23:06.635
No.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.305
You have big things to do
in the other world.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.439
Oh, God.

23:18.940 --> 23:19.773
Oh, God, oh, God,

23:19.774 --> 23:21.192
oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God...

23:22.193 --> 23:23.194
Farah?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.862
Okay... Hobbs!

23:25.863 --> 23:27.197
You alive?

23:27.198 --> 23:29.324
I'm definitely sort of alive...

23:29.325 --> 23:30.325
Tina?

23:30.326 --> 23:32.203
Hey, man, whassup?

23:33.996 --> 23:35.664
You're gonna be okay.

23:35.665 --> 23:36.790
Maybe...

23:36.791 --> 23:37.874
not, Todd.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.084
Here, I'll help--

23:40.962 --> 23:42.003
Who shot you?

23:42.004 --> 23:44.756
Oh, it was a whole thing.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.927
Listen, I'm so sorry about all of this.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.012
Are you apologizing to me

23:51.013 --> 23:52.557
for me saving your life?

23:54.725 --> 23:56.060
That is so you.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.271
Ow...

23:59.272 --> 24:00.857
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.651
Ow.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.292
Hello, Francis.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.085
It's nice to meet you.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.838
Thank you for your help, Mona.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.260
I couldn't have done this
without you, Dirk.

24:30.511 --> 24:31.846
Can I...

24:35.349 --> 24:37.018
Can I ask you...

24:39.937 --> 24:41.439
Do you know...

24:42.815 --> 24:44.400
what I am?

24:46.027 --> 24:47.320
Do you know...

24:48.446 --> 24:50.780
why I am?

24:50.781 --> 24:52.116
I know a little.

24:54.202 --> 24:56.245
We're supposed to help fix things.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.457
That's what all of us are.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.083
Tools...

25:02.084 --> 25:03.961
to fix the broken universe.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.759
There's problems in reality.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.553
You're supposed to repair them.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.598
<i>Each of us has a different purpose.</i>

25:16.599 --> 25:19.143
You help people
be where they should be.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.853
Hmm.

25:22.605 --> 25:23.563
And you?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.690
I was supposed to make things,

25:25.691 --> 25:28.068
but then my dreams
caused a problem

25:28.069 --> 25:29.362
that you had to fix.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.907
I wish my life in the other world

25:33.908 --> 25:35.825
had turned out better,

25:35.826 --> 25:38.453
but I guess
there are some things

25:38.454 --> 25:40.580
you just have to let go.

25:40.581 --> 25:45.294
You have to create your own world,
create your own family.

25:47.088 --> 25:50.882
But I suppose
you already know that,

25:50.883 --> 25:51.968
don't you, Dirk?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.139
Are you ready to go home?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.148
Yoo...?

26:07.692 --> 26:09.735
Now, what should I do with you?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.333
Hello.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.839
Thank you for getting rid
of all these jerks.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.926
There were only supposed
to be ten of them, not a whole army.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.845
Are you The Boy?

26:36.846 --> 26:38.638
That's me.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.641
Well, are you gonna
fix everything?

26:41.642 --> 26:43.643
You gonna make it all better?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.812
This was never meant to happen.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.565
I messed up
with the Suzi Boreton lady,

26:48.566 --> 26:50.942
and me messing up
led to more people dying,

26:50.943 --> 26:52.695
people who weren't supposed to.

26:56.991 --> 26:59.659
I can't beat it.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.661
You could stay here, you know.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.414
I'm gonna fix all this,

27:04.415 --> 27:05.750
make it all better.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.002
No, I can't.

27:09.503 --> 27:12.548
I can't, I would just ruin
your perfect world.

27:14.884 --> 27:16.593
I thought I was a leaf

27:16.594 --> 27:18.721
in the stream of creation.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.310
But I'm not.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.648
I'm on a wire.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.734
I'm a puppet.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.780
I'm not even a person.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.409
I'm just a weapon.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.369
In time,

27:42.370 --> 27:44.789
I hope you'll find that
that's not true.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.215
Get me outta here.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.258
Okay.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.302
Where do you want to go?

28:27.540 --> 28:29.874
Oh...

28:29.875 --> 28:31.961
now I get it.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.690
40 people dead,

28:53.691 --> 28:57.152
a security breach at one of the most
secure facilities in the world.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.529
This is a disaster.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.198
A disaster?

29:02.116 --> 29:03.325
Really?

29:04.785 --> 29:09.289
See, now,
that's just a matter of perspective.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.415
How so?

29:10.416 --> 29:13.502
Well, in the end,
the intrusion was contained.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.547
Look, I know

29:17.548 --> 29:23.219
this might seem like
a bunch of chaos to you,

29:23.220 --> 29:25.680
but what we're looking at

29:25.681 --> 29:29.143
is something far more significant.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.062
Enlighten me.

29:34.106 --> 29:38.568
These weapons and armor
are made of a metal

29:38.569 --> 29:42.030
unlike anything found on planet Earth.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.656
In Bergsberg,

29:43.657 --> 29:46.868
we have a permanent
research installation set up

29:46.869 --> 29:50.330
around a geometrically
impossible pocket dimension

29:50.331 --> 29:52.957
built into the farm house.

29:52.958 --> 29:59.130
What we have here
is conclusive proof

29:59.131 --> 30:00.716
of the supernatural.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.012
This is the greatest discovery
in human history.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.274
Nice spin.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.110
So, what now...

30:20.861 --> 30:22.446
Supervisor Adams?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.284
All I'm saying is, from now on,

30:28.285 --> 30:30.161
I'm all about moderation.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.413
Getting shot twice was enough.

30:32.414 --> 30:33.790
Bucket list, check!

30:33.791 --> 30:35.041
No need to do that ever again.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.000
Hey, I gotta tell you,

30:36.001 --> 30:38.045
it beats giving out
speeding tickets every day.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.547
Hobbs, you got turned into a zombie.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.298
Yeah. I know.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.592
I'm still hung over.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.427
I just feel like
I missed all the good stuff.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.387
Good stuff?

30:47.388 --> 30:50.557
Hobbs, do you know how much crazy crap
I had to do without you?

30:50.558 --> 30:52.600
There were witches and zombies
and wizards and shit--

30:52.601 --> 30:53.434
That's the good stuff--

30:53.435 --> 30:58.023
It was one of the top...
11 craziest experiences of my life.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.734
You did good, Tina.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.238
Thanks, Farah.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.866
Hobbs...
stop smiling at me like that.

31:07.867 --> 31:11.370
I just... I always knew
you'd be a good cop.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.415
Anyway, Farah,
I looked this morning,

31:15.416 --> 31:16.875
and, um, you are no longer

31:16.876 --> 31:19.127
on the FBI's most wanted list.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.461
Also, some, uh,

31:20.462 --> 31:21.754
some real spooky-type guys

31:21.755 --> 31:25.633
came around our hospital rooms
with secrecy contracts, I guess?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.761
I think they're trying to go around
and clean this whole thing up.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.763
It's Blackwing.

31:30.764 --> 31:34.100
Hey, if they wanted you,
they would've gotten you by now, right?

31:34.101 --> 31:35.560
That's probably true.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.855
I should probably
give this back to you.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.231
No. No, no, no, no.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.233
No, you keep that.

31:42.234 --> 31:47.405
Hey, federal regulation
8.51.91 clearly states

31:47.406 --> 31:49.532
that after a period of crisis

31:49.533 --> 31:52.911
all police property must be returned
by a deputized civilian.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.078
Come on.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.122
No.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.416
You keep that.

32:08.469 --> 32:09.761
New outfit.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.679
Is this the Fall look?

32:11.680 --> 32:14.433
Thrifting in Montana
is better than you'd expect.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.644
It's a thing.

32:17.645 --> 32:20.063
You guys are all doing a thing.

32:20.064 --> 32:22.315
Yeah, I'm trying to get them
to all to wear gray--

32:24.193 --> 32:26.235
It's kind of like weirdly early 2000s?

32:26.236 --> 32:27.612
It's supposed to represent duality.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.947
No, I got that.

32:28.948 --> 32:29.989
That's not subtle.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.326
So...

32:33.327 --> 32:34.535
what now?

32:34.536 --> 32:35.870
Back to normal life?

32:35.871 --> 32:37.455
Yeah.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.165
Maybe I'll get a job.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.084
I could be a hostess at T.G.I.Fridays.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.962
Yeah, I didn't think so.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.922
You know, I saw things,

32:45.923 --> 32:47.632
in my visions.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.967
Something big is coming.

32:48.968 --> 32:51.803
Reality is falling apart
at the seams, dude.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.014
There's more people
out there like Dirk.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.976
Someone has to find them
before Blackwing does.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.269
Yeah, but why
does it have to be you?

33:00.270 --> 33:03.898
That's where the road is taking me.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.985
I'm a leaf on the stream of creation.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.362
You could come too.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.155
Both of you.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.700
Your powers could be
really helpful, Dirk.

33:13.701 --> 33:16.202
Oh, yes, well, that's not really--

33:16.203 --> 33:18.496
How it works, right, yeah.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.999
Well, you guys got
your own thing to do.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.084
I guess it's just the six of us.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.086
Six?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.590
A lil gits!

33:29.591 --> 33:32.093
I fown fahoo, beautyboy.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.470
- Oh, um...
- Here.

33:34.471 --> 33:35.931
Nice.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.017
Ahluya foheeva, Bibbit.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.696
I, uh, forgot to give you this.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.283
the Rowdy 3 found it forever ago
back at the Ridgely.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.873
Hey...

34:01.874 --> 34:02.875
Good luck.

34:06.670 --> 34:07.837
I love you, Todd.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.673
I love you too, sis.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.512
- Time to boogie.
- Let's go, boys.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.514
All right.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.522
Wow, so...

34:26.523 --> 34:30.109
the rainbow monster,
she looked, uh...

34:30.110 --> 34:31.653
Not really my thing, Todd.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.782
You don't think that cave girl from
fairy land staying here is going to--

34:35.783 --> 34:37.200
Eventually connect
to something in some way

34:37.201 --> 34:40.036
that eventually becomes
a simply enormous problem?

34:40.037 --> 34:41.204
I mean, yes, Todd.

34:41.205 --> 34:42.413
That's obvious.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.539
Oh.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.043
If loose ends are gonna be a problem,
I should probably...

34:46.794 --> 34:48.212
Uh...

34:50.422 --> 34:51.631
Oh! The--

34:51.632 --> 34:52.965
You got the awesome gun!

34:52.966 --> 34:54.092
- Right?
- Yeah!

34:54.093 --> 34:56.385
You see, I knew I could
get away with this one!

34:57.262 --> 34:59.223
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

35:12.236 --> 35:13.529
You okay?

35:15.322 --> 35:16.573
You know what?

35:18.200 --> 35:19.409
I really am.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.664
Hey, Dirk.

35:24.665 --> 35:25.706
You solved the case.

35:25.707 --> 35:26.708
Eh...

35:27.584 --> 35:28.960
It was an easy one.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.294
An easy one!

35:30.295 --> 35:31.671
Go screw yourself.

35:31.672 --> 35:32.505
Well, everything is relative.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.383
Oh, is that your new thing?

35:36.260 --> 35:37.970
What do you think happened
to Suzi Boreton?

35:47.146 --> 35:48.856
I'm okay.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.818
I'm okay!

35:55.445 --> 35:56.654
Ow, my hip...

36:03.328 --> 36:04.788
Hello?

36:08.917 --> 36:10.918
Hello?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.675
Oh no...

36:17.676 --> 36:19.468
No...

36:19.469 --> 36:20.845
No!

36:20.846 --> 36:24.516
No! No!

36:35.235 --> 36:36.820

38:20.590 --> 38:22.216
As you can see,

38:22.217 --> 38:24.885
there have been
a number of changes

38:24.886 --> 38:26.595
to the program.

38:26.596 --> 38:29.473
I think you'll find it
much more rewarding

38:29.474 --> 38:31.434
than your last visit.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.103
But on a personal level,

38:34.855 --> 38:36.898
I'm just so extremely happy to see you.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.152
Yeah, it's good to see you too, Ken.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.530
The world out there is...

38:44.531 --> 38:48.117
it's confusing and irritating,

38:48.118 --> 38:49.493
and I'm sick of it.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.872
Well, I can certainly relate to that.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.667
We're going to figure it all out together,

38:56.668 --> 38:58.003
I promise.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.885
Uh... well, hey,

39:05.886 --> 39:08.429
where are you going
in such a hurry?

39:08.430 --> 39:09.430
What are you,

39:09.431 --> 39:11.391
are you some big business now?

39:13.435 --> 39:17.272
Yes, actually I am.

39:19.066 --> 39:21.609
I'll see you soon, Bart.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.487
I think we're going
to have a lot of fun.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.282
Ken?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.618
I think I should tell you,

39:30.619 --> 39:32.703
the universe is sort of...

39:32.704 --> 39:35.415
making me feel like
I should kill you now.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.796
I anticipated that might happen.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.756
But you won't,

39:43.757 --> 39:45.175
will you?

39:47.636 --> 39:51.889
We're going to bring
order to the universe.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.475
I'm going to bring everything

39:54.476 --> 39:56.977
under control.

40:02.484 --> 40:03.943
So in your world,

40:03.944 --> 40:06.321
do you see yourself
as one of the good guys?

40:08.824 --> 40:10.699
Mr. Priest,

40:10.700 --> 40:13.453
in my world,
there are no "good guys."
