is that unless

and not to worry
about rate adjustments

05:29.546 --> 05:31.548
because we would be able
to refinance
before the loan resets.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.681
Then you told us it would be
"advantageous

05:33.724 --> 05:37.075

statement to help facilitate
the approving process."

It had a quarter-sized
hot sauce stain on it.

You were worried
because you were

getting ready to
take your photo ID.

05:58.053 --> 06:01.535

and there's the stain.

don't I remember, exactly?

At least you got
a month's extension.
It's something.

Is it?
What's gonna make it better
next month?

06:19.509 --> 06:21.424
Chocolate milk shakes
and cheese fries.

01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:52.190
Scary.

01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:53.844
Exciting.

01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:57.239
Well, you look good.

01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:00.633
You look real good.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:04.681
I'm glad you're
looking at me again.

01:26:10.904 --> 01:26:14.212
I can't believe
our baby's 4 years old.

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:16.997
She sure was
the best
birthday present ever.

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:20.305
You know,
it's good to share a birthday
with your child.

01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:22.829
It keeps the day
from ever being
able to get you down.

01:26:23.961 --> 01:26:26.442
She loved that dollhouse
you got her.

01:26:26.485 --> 01:26:28.444
She wanted a pony.

01:26:29.836 --> 01:26:31.577
What about you?

01:26:33.057 --> 01:26:34.450
What do you want?

01:26:37.409 --> 01:26:39.411
You know what I want.

01:26:48.072 --> 01:26:50.379
I'm taking baby steps.

01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:56.689
What do you think?

01:26:56.733 --> 01:26:59.953
I think that's the second-best
birthday present I ever got.
