00:18.516 --> 00:20.560
So, what did she say?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.284
'For what will it profit a man

00:22.310 --> 00:25.559
if he gains the whole world
and loses his own soul?'

00:26.370 --> 00:30.806
I had to reply, 'A new church organ,
Mrs M, that's the whole point.'

00:31.604 --> 00:34.222
I mean, it's bingo in the church hall.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.840
- Mm.
- Not exactly money lending in the temple.

00:37.549 --> 00:39.502
- Morning, Mrs Browne.
- Good morning.

00:40.611 --> 00:42.374
I shouldn't be surprised, really.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.000
She once told me she
doesn't hold for tombolas.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.024
They're Satan's work, apparently.

00:47.553 --> 00:48.880
We should hurry.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.880
- If you'd like tea.
- Actually, I have something for you.

00:54.870 --> 00:55.873
Oh!

00:56.480 --> 00:58.080
Hey! Come on!

00:58.370 --> 01:00.770
- Morning, Mr Finch.
- Morning, Miss Parker.

01:02.021 --> 01:06.092
It's just a little thank you
for being so kind recently.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.380
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, it's nothing.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.880
Hilary Franklin. I have
a parcel to collect.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.225
The one all the way from America?
We don't get many of those.

01:14.482 --> 01:17.797
Will you be taking Bible studies
this week, Mr Finch?

01:18.501 --> 01:20.234
I do hope so.

01:20.260 --> 01:22.540
You always say such clever things.

01:32.530 --> 01:35.280
Please be gentle.

01:35.306 --> 01:38.036
Miss Parker has a weak heart. Please.

01:38.838 --> 01:40.158
Leonard!

02:00.500 --> 02:02.032
Hello.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.720
You're getting so big.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.041
So...

02:14.873 --> 02:15.958
Eh?

02:20.219 --> 02:24.497
I leave her alone for five seconds and
she's got a man fawning over her already!

02:26.528 --> 02:28.165
Must get it from her mother.

02:28.326 --> 02:30.446
Well, it's better that than
my taste for Martinis.

02:33.411 --> 02:34.688
How are you?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.880
I got a job. At the Fitzwilliam.

02:38.609 --> 02:39.880
That's wonderful.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.880
- It's just a few mornings a week, but...
- That's wonderful.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.591
You're dripping all over my clean floor!

02:51.785 --> 02:53.068
Bath!

02:57.400 --> 02:58.827
Come on, then!

02:58.971 --> 03:02.174
Ooh! Could you bear to have her Friday?

03:02.200 --> 03:04.200
I'll have her any time you like.

03:05.846 --> 03:07.520
Thank you so much, Sylvia.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.120
Come on, then.

03:14.565 --> 03:17.165
The path to righteousness is never easy.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.625
The vicarage.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.247
- What is it?
- Is he all right?

03:38.160 --> 03:39.612
What's happened?

03:42.230 --> 03:44.403
So you didn't manage
to get a look at his face?

03:44.882 --> 03:47.273
The... The mask. You see?

03:48.764 --> 03:51.761
- He had dark eyes.
- Dark, because of the mask?

03:52.093 --> 03:53.515
Possibly.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.266
How tall was he?

03:56.623 --> 03:58.724
My height? Geordie's height?

04:01.003 --> 04:02.762
- Geordie's height.
- Your height.

04:02.788 --> 04:05.228
Or somewhere... there... abouts.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.024
Nine millimetre. A Browning, maybe?

04:08.050 --> 04:11.487
It was bigger than that. The gun
was bigger than nine millimetres.

04:11.513 --> 04:12.953
I know that much.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.040
Dad.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.519
Excuse me. Has somebody
checked her heart?

04:17.560 --> 04:20.640
- She has a weak heart.
- I'm fine, honestly. - You're sure?

04:20.666 --> 04:22.920
- Mr Finch stood up for her.
- He did.

04:23.326 --> 04:25.360
- He stood up for me.
- It was nothing, really.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.096
Doesn't sound like nothing.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.040
He was a bit of a hero.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.160
- He was an absolute hero.
- Gary Cooper, step aside.

04:37.803 --> 04:40.164
You know, they say, in moments of peril,

04:41.137 --> 04:43.116
your life flashes before your eyes.

04:43.142 --> 04:44.975
Well, I didn't see anything at all.

04:45.845 --> 04:47.600
Apart from the back of your jacket.

04:48.628 --> 04:51.607
All I saw was an overdue library
book at my bedside table.

04:52.681 --> 04:55.681
A penny a day. Imagine the fine.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.720
So, as I was saying, the GPO van
came over first thing this morning.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.858
They go from post office to post
office. Pension day, you see.

05:04.884 --> 05:07.801
- So the till would be at its fullest?
- 20 pounds, yes.

05:08.028 --> 05:09.311
20 pounds?!

05:09.428 --> 05:12.698
- That much?
- I'm sorry, Dad. I'm... I'm so sorry.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.760
Oh, no, no. No need to
get excited, my dear.

05:14.800 --> 05:19.198
Well, if you could put us in contact with the
GPO, Mr Parker, that would help a great deal.

05:19.224 --> 05:21.224
Certainly. Ready?

05:24.660 --> 05:26.358
That's what he was wearing!

05:28.640 --> 05:31.040
With the... insignia and everything.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.940
That's what he was wearing.

05:33.426 --> 05:34.719
Walter Dunn.

05:36.138 --> 05:39.204
He's got previous for aggravated
assault and armed robbery.

05:39.230 --> 05:40.839
_

05:42.532 --> 05:43.823
Be careful.

05:46.902 --> 05:49.502
This bastard's spent more time
inside than he has out.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.477
He's extremely dangerous.
And we know he's armed.

05:55.561 --> 05:58.480
If he fights back, you wait for
my command before you fire.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.369
- Do you understand?
- Yes, guv.

06:03.495 --> 06:04.970
Let me speak to him.

06:04.996 --> 06:06.635
- I'll go.
- I don't think so.

06:07.245 --> 06:08.591
You're staying here.

06:09.363 --> 06:10.557
Let's move.

06:33.998 --> 06:35.514
Your boss. Where is he?

06:35.762 --> 06:37.017
He's up there.

06:49.549 --> 06:51.140
Police! On your feet!

06:53.289 --> 06:54.776
On your feet.

06:56.737 --> 06:58.067
On your feet, Walter!

07:08.120 --> 07:10.716
Jesus Christ, what the hell
were you thinking?

07:10.742 --> 07:13.882
His hand moved. I thought he was
trying to reach for the gun.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.800
His hand moved!

07:18.720 --> 07:19.958
He's dead.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.588
He was already dead.

07:34.130 --> 07:35.341
What's that?

07:35.770 --> 07:36.841
Is that a button?

07:38.770 --> 07:40.930
So, there's some sort of struggle.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.909
He's shot point-blank.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.422
He falls back.

07:49.890 --> 07:51.442
Someone turned the chair.

07:59.410 --> 08:00.690
It's funny, isn't it?

08:02.331 --> 08:03.776
We just go through life.

08:04.807 --> 08:08.986
We just assume we'll get up tomorrow,
that we'll go about our business.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.963
But we could be gone.

08:13.718 --> 08:15.133
That's the truth of it.

08:16.509 --> 08:19.835
All those plans. All those dreams.

08:22.090 --> 08:23.442
Have you ever been?

08:27.130 --> 08:28.552
I've never been anywhere.

08:47.220 --> 08:50.956
So I've got that interview coming
up, the sergeant's job.

08:51.066 --> 08:53.598
And you're telling me
this now, because...?

08:53.624 --> 08:55.566
I could do with someone
putting in a good word.

08:55.662 --> 08:57.186
That someone being me?

08:57.970 --> 09:00.090
Well... I hoped.

09:00.130 --> 09:02.490
- Maybe.
- After you nearly blew my head off?

09:03.687 --> 09:04.986
Paperwork!

09:05.433 --> 09:08.005
That's the only word you'll be
hearing for the foreseeable.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.545
And every bullet has
to be accounted for.

09:13.225 --> 09:14.681
Got yesterday's date.

09:14.718 --> 09:16.490
That and the state of the body...

09:18.132 --> 09:21.274
He'd been dead a good 12 hours
before the robbery took place.

09:22.477 --> 09:24.797
So who's the chump in the gas mask?

09:27.210 --> 09:30.431
Well, my guess, it's the fella who
shot Walter with his own gun.

09:34.570 --> 09:37.850
So, we're agreed? I do as
the solicitor suggested?

09:38.083 --> 09:40.372
Book a guest house? Tip
off a private detective?

09:40.779 --> 09:42.979
Pretend to have the
energy for an affair?

09:43.193 --> 09:44.193
Mm.

09:44.622 --> 09:47.435
Has Sidney volunteered his services?
To be the other man?

09:48.010 --> 09:51.610
We're friends. It wasn't always
the truth, but it is now.

09:52.971 --> 09:55.629
I... I want you to see Grace, I do.

09:55.782 --> 09:57.183
As much as you like.

10:01.174 --> 10:03.171
- Are we wrong? To give it all up?

10:03.886 --> 10:06.290
- Guy... - Marriages go through
worse, don't they? So much worse.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.457
Guy...

10:09.650 --> 10:12.185
For her sake, please,
just let's be civil.

10:20.104 --> 10:21.606
I'll book the guest house.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.100
I'll do it. You shouldn't
have to go through that.

10:27.446 --> 10:29.082
What time did you two get in?

10:29.752 --> 10:32.590
- Nine.
- About nine.

10:32.683 --> 10:36.037
So, you've been here for three hours
and you haven't been up to his office?

10:36.583 --> 10:37.621
No.

10:37.933 --> 10:39.151
Three hours?

10:39.542 --> 10:41.112
And you didn't once check on him?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.487
Mr Dunn doesn't like to be
disturbed of a morning.

10:44.370 --> 10:46.099
He likes a drink, you see.

10:47.099 --> 10:50.646
The morning after a night before,
he isn't the cheeriest of fellows.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.170
It'll be Alice.

10:57.286 --> 10:59.972
It'll be his wife telling him
his dinner's on the table.

11:11.730 --> 11:14.730
..and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

11:14.770 --> 11:18.191
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now and...

11:18.217 --> 11:19.323
Alice!

11:20.956 --> 11:22.340
It's about Walter.

11:32.113 --> 11:33.523
He's dead, isn't he?

11:37.490 --> 11:39.930
Oh, God!

11:46.189 --> 11:47.890
Is God punishing me?

11:49.330 --> 11:50.716
Why would he punish you?

11:53.050 --> 11:54.987
This is my punishment, isn't it?

11:55.370 --> 11:57.370
Sssh. It's OK.

11:57.865 --> 11:59.410
Rest your eyes.

12:08.210 --> 12:12.130
Why would she say that? Why would
she think that she's being punished?

12:12.678 --> 12:15.690
Maybe Walter found out pretty boy
Frank is screwing his missus.

12:16.955 --> 12:18.172
There's a scuffle.

12:19.490 --> 12:22.786
If he was all over my wife like that,
I'd have something to say about it.

12:27.410 --> 12:28.833
Is it still going on?

12:29.973 --> 12:31.230
You and Margaret?

12:35.242 --> 12:36.903
You were going to end it.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.330
- I tried.
- Oh, well, that's all right then!

12:49.533 --> 12:50.836
We made a pact.

12:51.516 --> 12:54.036
Oh, Jesus Christ,
this isn't bloody school.

12:54.930 --> 12:56.520
I don't feel good about it, Sidney.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.441
I don't feel good about any of it.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.170
Er, Frank Camber, the
mechanic at Dunn's garage.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.050
- Any background yet?
- Nope.

13:16.223 --> 13:17.752
But this might interest you.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.098
Well, I doubt it, Phil,
but let's give it a go.

13:21.810 --> 13:26.108
The breakdown from the GPO. The money
Parker put in the till this morning.

13:26.761 --> 13:28.410
Five one pound notes,

13:28.900 --> 13:30.450
three bags of pennies,

13:31.207 --> 13:32.490
two of threepenny bits

13:32.530 --> 13:35.171
and three bags of
shillings, so that's...

13:35.919 --> 13:37.050
Ten pounds.

13:37.090 --> 13:39.170
Plus a bag of half crowns.

13:39.196 --> 13:41.037
That's 2s/6d times ten...

13:41.841 --> 13:43.530
- Plus the pennies.
- Plus the pennies.

13:43.726 --> 13:45.413
It's ten pounds.

13:47.722 --> 13:49.122
It's ten pounds.

13:49.531 --> 13:51.312
Ten less than he told us.

13:57.657 --> 14:00.026
Sweating like a strumpet on Sunday.

14:00.052 --> 14:02.382
I give it ten minutes
before he falls apart.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.174
Make that five.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.918
Regarding the post office robbery,

14:14.944 --> 14:17.690
I believe I told you that
20 pounds was taken.

14:17.730 --> 14:21.586
I apologise. It was a mistake.
It was, er, it was only ten pounds.

14:23.890 --> 14:26.446
- That's quite a mistake.
- Isn't it?

14:27.070 --> 14:30.010
Well, erm, my daughter is, er...

14:30.050 --> 14:34.439
very unwell and my...
my wife died some years ago.

14:34.465 --> 14:36.881
Did you rob your own
post office, Mr Parker?

14:37.850 --> 14:40.005
I... I am utterly...

14:40.583 --> 14:42.610
outraged that... that...
that you would suggest...

14:42.650 --> 14:44.782
- Yes or no?
- No!

14:44.930 --> 14:47.970
- Were you trying to fiddle the insurance?
- That is outrageous!

14:48.010 --> 14:49.502
Did you kill Walter Dunn?

14:51.466 --> 14:52.485
What?

14:52.746 --> 14:57.185
Did you kill him, take his gun and
use it to rob your own post office?

14:58.450 --> 14:59.429
No!

15:00.708 --> 15:02.142
No.

15:03.247 --> 15:06.650
All right, I saw a way to make some
money by lying about the amount.

15:07.209 --> 15:10.210
I did it for the insurance.
I confess, I confess it all, but I...

15:10.834 --> 15:13.170
I would never rob anyone.
I would never hurt anyone.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.410
I'm an honourable citizen, a good man.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.320
I believe him. Do you believe him?

15:19.346 --> 15:22.339
I believe him. Everything but
the 'honourable citizen' bit.

15:23.430 --> 15:26.491
Well, your boss, in his infinite wisdom,
is reluctant to press charges.

15:27.965 --> 15:29.559
You're free to go, Mr Parker.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.410
Did you see that?
She just said something.

15:58.450 --> 16:01.850
- I think that was a hiccup.
- No. Did you try to say 'duck'?

16:02.850 --> 16:04.747
Did you try to say 'duck'?

16:05.090 --> 16:07.090
Our daughter is a genius!

16:08.018 --> 16:09.397
She gets that from me.

16:15.871 --> 16:17.751
Oh, sorry.

16:19.063 --> 16:20.370
It's the shock.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.466
It does funny things to you.

16:25.170 --> 16:28.569
Er... I hope it was
worth all the trouble.

16:29.519 --> 16:32.323
The American version had
such lovely illustrations.

16:43.930 --> 16:45.006
Oh, my.

16:45.570 --> 16:47.454
It's got your favourite in.

16:49.450 --> 16:51.450
- Thank you.
- Oh...

16:53.530 --> 16:55.655
Everyone in the village
is talking about you,

16:56.583 --> 16:58.583
saying how brave you were.

17:00.370 --> 17:05.721
Mr Chapman asked if we might be
stepping out to the bingo together.

17:10.898 --> 17:12.126
I do...

17:13.290 --> 17:15.648
..think of you, Leonard.

17:17.877 --> 17:19.460
Do you ever think of me?

17:29.507 --> 17:30.621
Oh.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.570
Er, don't mind me.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.214
As you were.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.905
Sorry, do you mind if I...

17:51.350 --> 17:52.902
No, no.

17:57.485 --> 17:59.264
I wasn't going to tell you.

18:00.344 --> 18:02.711
There wasn't really anyone
else to tell and...

18:04.010 --> 18:06.655
I don't want you to think
I'm asking anything of you.

18:08.642 --> 18:09.890
Margaret...

18:10.883 --> 18:12.483
I thought I might be pregnant.

18:13.450 --> 18:14.930
I'm not, but...

18:16.024 --> 18:18.504
..there were a few days
I thought I might be.

18:20.410 --> 18:22.674
I know you don't like to think about it.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.250
The future and everything.

18:25.477 --> 18:29.077
I don't either, but... one
day we might have to.

18:29.970 --> 18:32.570
Robbery in progress.
Ellsworth Post Office.

18:33.227 --> 18:34.716
Oh, shit.

18:35.890 --> 18:38.810
- Mr Parker's on the phone.
- How many units on the road?

18:39.139 --> 18:41.939
Four, but the closest
is nine miles away.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.650
They're not gonna get there.

18:44.690 --> 18:48.053
- Yeah, Mr Parker? - <i>Inspector?</i>
- Can you see what's happening?

18:48.079 --> 18:50.879
<i>No. I'm in the back room.
But they've got a gun!</i>

18:51.453 --> 18:54.450
- How many of them are there?
- <i>Two.</i> - There's two?

18:55.002 --> 18:56.490
Can you describe them to me?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.363
<i>They're wearing masks. Gas masks!</i>

18:59.460 --> 19:01.930
<i>They're coming in! Oh, my
God, they're coming in!</i>

19:01.970 --> 19:03.970
- Mr Parker?
- <i>Stay away! Stay away!</i>

19:04.010 --> 19:05.770
Aaah!

19:05.810 --> 19:07.810
Mr Parker?

19:08.144 --> 19:09.450
Mr Parker?

19:29.180 --> 19:33.064
Now, now, no tears. Now don't
go getting over-excited.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.554
- She's got a weak heart.
- They know, Dad.

19:35.580 --> 19:36.793
How much did they get?

19:37.620 --> 19:39.220
Oh, nothing. Well...

19:39.260 --> 19:43.800
A few shillings. I put most of
it in the safe out the back.

19:43.826 --> 19:46.060
- And there were two of them? You're sure?
- Yeah.

19:46.399 --> 19:47.910
In all their clobber.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.955
Gave me quite a fright, I can tell you.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.584
If they didn't get what they wanted...

19:53.573 --> 19:55.344
They're going to do it again.

19:55.432 --> 19:57.432
I heard one of their voices.

19:58.328 --> 20:00.608
She screamed when the other one shot me.

20:03.658 --> 20:07.275
Right. We're looking for two suspects.
A man and a woman.

20:07.301 --> 20:10.942
We've got our very own Bonnie
and Clyde. How about that?

20:11.342 --> 20:14.234
Why would one person do the first
robbery and two the second?

20:14.283 --> 20:16.346
What does any of it
have to do with Walter Dunn?

20:17.138 --> 20:18.380
Frank Camber.

20:19.544 --> 20:22.964
He did 12 months in Feltham
Borstal during the war.

20:23.002 --> 20:25.580
Seems while everyone else was
running for the shelters,

20:25.620 --> 20:28.533
little Frank was using the blackout
to knock off their homes.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.812
Perhaps it's him and Alice.
Perhaps they're in on it together.

20:36.078 --> 20:37.549
Paperwork, Phil.

20:51.339 --> 20:52.496
Alice.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.807
Alice! Martha's here.

21:02.233 --> 21:03.852
I'm so sorry, Alice.

21:05.492 --> 21:07.150
If there's anything I can do?

22:14.936 --> 22:16.434
That's not mine.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.863
Alice Dunn, Frank Camber, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder and armed robbery.

22:20.889 --> 22:22.040
Frank!

22:27.025 --> 22:28.540
There's nowhere to run, Frank.

22:42.925 --> 22:45.435
Where were you
the night Walter was murdered?

22:45.461 --> 22:46.523
Church.

22:46.549 --> 22:49.100
Where were you Thursday morning,
ten o'clock?

22:49.140 --> 22:52.556
- Church.
- Last night? Church, too?

22:52.743 --> 22:55.162
Father Conlan says
he hasn't seen you in weeks.

22:55.795 --> 22:58.340
What's the nature of your
relationship with Frank Camber?

22:58.380 --> 22:59.643
We're friends.

23:01.043 --> 23:04.620
You see, I'm of the opinion that
when a man is close with a woman...

23:05.988 --> 23:07.769
it's always more than friends.

23:08.731 --> 23:10.931
- I take care of her.
- Why?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.251
She's nice to me.

23:13.513 --> 23:14.603
She's kind.

23:14.629 --> 23:17.509
And Walter? Was he kind?

23:20.653 --> 23:22.705
Did your husband ever hurt you?

23:27.056 --> 23:30.834
Perhaps, this time, you
couldn't take it any more.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.913
- Did she kill him, Frank?
- No.

23:34.939 --> 23:38.170
Perhaps Alice killed him and
you needed to get her away.

23:38.196 --> 23:41.340
I was at the dentist the night
he died. She was at the church.

23:41.630 --> 23:42.820
You've got the receipt.

23:44.408 --> 23:46.706
I've never seen it before.
I don't know how it got there.

23:46.940 --> 23:49.880
A button is missing. Like there's
been some kind of struggle.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.369
I've never seen it before.

23:52.490 --> 23:55.250
Robbing houses while heroes fought?

23:56.228 --> 23:57.557
I was a kid.

24:00.032 --> 24:01.312
I don't do that any more.

24:01.471 --> 24:04.920
A few robberies? Get enough cash for
the pair of you to make an escape?

24:04.946 --> 24:06.700
You'd do anything for that woman.

24:09.039 --> 24:10.780
I work hard. I keep my head down.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.977
You'd do anything.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.300
- Wouldn't you?
- I can't go back inside.

24:18.353 --> 24:20.006
Don't make me go back there.

24:24.634 --> 24:29.005
A pretty boy like him? A fair bet
he had a time of it in Borstal.

24:29.285 --> 24:31.285
So why would he risk his freedom?

24:33.257 --> 24:37.752
If Alice killed Walter, why did she
say his death was a punishment?

24:38.233 --> 24:40.107
- Punishment for what?
- Sidney...

24:40.916 --> 24:41.980
Too many questions?

24:42.020 --> 24:45.233
Too many questions. Just let them
stew in the cells for a bit.

24:46.019 --> 24:47.655
We'll get a confession out of them.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.349
Don't fancy a pint, do you?

24:51.101 --> 24:52.271
Thanks.

24:56.571 --> 24:57.906
Maybe another time.

25:00.201 --> 25:02.878
Sidney... I don't have what you have.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.446
God and...

25:07.140 --> 25:08.719
I don't have your strength.

25:23.887 --> 25:25.887
We'd just walked in, hadn't we?

25:25.913 --> 25:27.686
Said good morning to Miss Parker.

25:27.712 --> 25:30.646
'Good morning, lovely day', I said.

25:30.672 --> 25:33.980
Well, maybe not 'lovely day'.
I might be embellishing just a little.

25:34.020 --> 25:37.500
And then she went back behind
the counter... and there he was.

25:37.540 --> 25:38.971
There he was.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.583
Like a wraith from the Tolkien novel.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.370
You draw numbers. Somebody wins.

25:46.396 --> 25:48.039
That's gambling in my book.

25:48.065 --> 25:49.764
It's a bit of fun, Sylvia.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.386
Nothing fun is without sin.

25:52.474 --> 25:54.674
I know. Isn't it marvellous?

25:57.573 --> 25:59.286
Fantastic turn-out, Leonard.

25:59.312 --> 26:01.831
Mrs Maguire! I've saved you a seat.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.429
Quite a girl, Leonard.
I'd say she's a keeper.

26:06.045 --> 26:10.002
Best watch out. He'll be walking
down the aisle before you do.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.140
Whoo.

26:15.415 --> 26:17.015
Whoo.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.242
Ahem.

26:24.827 --> 26:26.220
Excuse me!

26:28.660 --> 26:30.660
Excuse me!

26:31.829 --> 26:33.697
Er, hello. Erm...

26:35.402 --> 26:38.460
I... I shall be your caller tonight.

26:41.662 --> 26:43.382
Well... All right, then.

26:45.015 --> 26:46.980
You're all aware of the rules, I hope?

26:47.020 --> 26:48.888
So, we shall play ten games,

26:48.914 --> 26:52.020
the last of which could win you
a lovely Madeira cake.

26:52.271 --> 26:54.551
So, eyes down for the first number.

27:03.340 --> 27:04.917
Mrs M's age.

27:06.601 --> 27:07.820
21!

27:13.100 --> 27:15.180
Never thought of myself having kids.

27:16.577 --> 27:18.735
Just something
that never crossed my mind.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.900
You'll make a great mum one day.

27:43.699 --> 27:46.048
It would be wonderful if you could
stay the whole night.

27:47.613 --> 27:49.035
Just one time.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.259
I think Leonard might
have found his calling.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.442
We all thought it was writing
impenetrable sermons.

28:25.711 --> 28:28.871
How was Guy? I saw that he was here.

28:30.152 --> 28:32.152
Do you know, he was... fine.

28:32.856 --> 28:34.157
Pleasant, even.

28:35.063 --> 28:36.981
We were discussing the legal plans.

28:37.794 --> 28:39.338
You don't have to tell me.

28:39.936 --> 28:41.192
I know.

28:42.607 --> 28:44.057
As a friend...

28:44.989 --> 28:46.580
it's really none of my business.

28:50.785 --> 28:52.300
I should get Grace home.

28:53.818 --> 28:55.744
You could go back to him, you know.

28:57.763 --> 28:59.100
It'd be easy enough.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.046
To slip back into his life.

29:04.420 --> 29:05.874
Back into his bed.

29:08.656 --> 29:13.743
It's not like a friend can offer
the same... comfort a husband does.

29:15.084 --> 29:17.054
I don't like this any more than you do.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.896
But we are where we are.

29:36.926 --> 29:39.126
Seven pounds and six shillings.

29:39.580 --> 29:43.073
It's hardly enough to buy
half a pipe but it's a start.

29:46.356 --> 29:47.500
What are you doing?

29:47.656 --> 29:49.713
I was thinking of joining
you for a drink.

29:50.064 --> 29:51.366
With Hilary.

29:51.727 --> 29:53.108
What are you doing?

29:54.809 --> 29:56.609
She's a parishioner.

29:57.035 --> 29:58.140
A friend.

29:58.305 --> 30:00.660
Friends don't buy each other love poems.

30:01.256 --> 30:02.300
Do you like her?

30:03.174 --> 30:05.712
- Well, I...
- It's a simple enough question, Leonard.

30:06.323 --> 30:08.084
She obviously likes you.

30:10.024 --> 30:12.900
Do you like her in the same way
you liked Daniel Marlowe?

30:19.827 --> 30:22.250
You're lying to yourself, Leonard.

30:23.078 --> 30:25.248
You can be such a bastard sometimes.

30:28.689 --> 30:31.866
I'm sorry that you're not very happy
at the moment.

30:32.116 --> 30:33.876
But that's not my fault.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.091
A whisky, please.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.018
How was the bingo?

31:01.020 --> 31:02.212
Thrilling.

31:09.180 --> 31:10.870
Margaret thought she was pregnant.

31:13.912 --> 31:15.535
She isn't, but...

31:18.886 --> 31:20.443
Bloody hell, Geordie.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.881
The more I think about it...

31:24.220 --> 31:26.115
if it had happened, if she had been...

31:28.492 --> 31:30.275
In another life, maybe.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.900
How is this all gonna end?

31:44.302 --> 31:47.182
All I know is, when I'm
with her, it all goes away.

31:47.568 --> 31:48.620
All the guilt.

31:48.856 --> 31:50.126
Just for a moment.

31:51.540 --> 31:54.634
Then I go home, I see
Cathy and the kids.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.580
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.166
- That's the Catholics.
- I know it's the Catholics.

32:05.540 --> 32:07.039
At least you're living.

32:08.397 --> 32:09.923
At least you're doing that much.

32:11.420 --> 32:13.420
Having God doesn't make it easier.

32:14.237 --> 32:15.914
If anything, it makes it worse.

32:17.258 --> 32:19.980
Trust you to feel guilty.
You haven't even done anything.

32:22.832 --> 32:25.336
I sometimes wonder if it would be
easier being a Catholic.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.956
You commit a sin,

32:27.600 --> 32:29.260
say a few Hail Marys.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.261
Make it all... go away.

32:36.270 --> 32:39.043
Why was Alice Dunn praying
when we got there?

32:40.624 --> 32:42.841
- She killed him.
- What if she didn't?

32:43.233 --> 32:45.690
What if she's feeling guilty
about something else?

32:46.752 --> 32:49.553
Five pounds to have a tooth extracted?

32:50.911 --> 32:52.640
That seem like an awful lot to you?

32:57.300 --> 32:59.300
A dentist in Northampton?

32:59.871 --> 33:01.871
Seems a long way to go, Frank.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.360
Unless they provide other procedures.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.653
Ones they don't advertise.

33:15.299 --> 33:17.699
Sometimes we do things
we're not proud of.

33:19.227 --> 33:21.627
Sometimes we feel that
we've let God down.

33:23.224 --> 33:24.992
The guilt gets too much.

33:27.561 --> 33:29.020
I couldn't keep it.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.845
- Alice?
- No.

33:32.592 --> 33:34.112
Just let me say it.

33:37.543 --> 33:39.543
Walter wanted a boy.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.419
And we tried for such a long time.

33:45.042 --> 33:46.897
But when it happened...

33:47.885 --> 33:50.097
You didn't want to have a baby with him.

33:50.386 --> 33:52.269
Not how he was.

33:52.456 --> 33:54.220
Not with the drinking and...

33:54.260 --> 33:56.260
You had an abortion.

33:58.984 --> 34:00.513
And you went with her.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.500
She was gonna hurt herself otherwise.

34:02.764 --> 34:04.540
Do you know the worst of it...

34:06.199 --> 34:08.199
..is that I don't even regret it.

34:12.449 --> 34:14.449
God will forgive me, won't he?

34:18.719 --> 34:21.520
You both have an alibi for
the night of the murder.

34:23.621 --> 34:25.415
If this isn't yours, whose is it?

34:29.697 --> 34:33.619
You understand that they're still out
there and they don't care who they hurt?

34:34.179 --> 34:35.831
I don't know for sure.

34:36.717 --> 34:38.058
You have an idea, though.

34:39.376 --> 34:40.629
I know I do.

34:42.219 --> 34:43.351
Who?

34:43.726 --> 34:45.820
She was the only one
with him that night.

34:47.391 --> 34:49.072
It must have crossed your mind.

34:49.768 --> 34:51.181
His secretary.

34:51.909 --> 34:53.399
Martha Bennett.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.260
He took a fancy to her from the start.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.248
Please.

34:58.331 --> 35:00.420
Don't... Don't be silly.

35:01.105 --> 35:03.220
He made her life such a misery

35:03.260 --> 35:04.860
and...

35:04.900 --> 35:06.626
I stood by...

35:07.520 --> 35:09.864
because he stopped hurting me.

35:15.736 --> 35:17.736
Oh, that poor girl.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.154
So which post office
carries the most cash?

35:29.180 --> 35:31.140
- Well, it varies.
- It's dependent.

35:31.351 --> 35:33.375
- On what?
- All sorts of factors.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.703
- Which one's been topped up...
- Which ones are being topped up today?

35:36.957 --> 35:39.808
The van starts at Milton and then
works its way down to Fulbourn.

35:40.371 --> 35:43.229
I want an armed guard
on every post office.

35:43.255 --> 35:46.128
- Martha Bennett?
- Hasn't been seen since the wake yesterday.

35:46.371 --> 35:50.371
The landlady's never seen her with a
fella. Never talked about a boyfriend.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.660
Does she have a brother?
A male acquaintance?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.366
Come on, Phil, we need
to find these people!

35:58.557 --> 36:00.961
We need to go back over everything.
Right from the start.

36:04.311 --> 36:08.151
- So you were where?
- About here, I'd say.

36:08.177 --> 36:10.877
- And Miss Parker is here, is she?
- Yes.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.703
And that's when...

36:13.020 --> 36:14.740
he comes in.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.897
That's it. That's... That's...
That's all there was to it, really.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.190
We're missing something here.

36:37.905 --> 36:41.105
Start again. Start at when you came in.

36:41.131 --> 36:44.851
- At the bingo, you said Miss Parker
came back behind the desk. - Yes.

36:44.877 --> 36:46.741
So, where was she when you came in?

36:48.817 --> 36:50.681
She was over here.

36:51.108 --> 36:54.482
And she was putting up an advertisement.

36:55.740 --> 36:56.887
Which one?

36:57.639 --> 36:59.466
I... I don't know. It's not here.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.478
Geordie.

37:11.199 --> 37:14.639
What? She put it up, then
took it down again. Why?

37:16.220 --> 37:17.794
What if it was a signal?

37:18.020 --> 37:23.547
- It was a signal for Martha? Wendy Parker is in on it?
- She heard you talking about the armed guards.

37:23.573 --> 37:26.020
They've got no chance of robbing
the post offices.

37:26.060 --> 37:28.489
- If they want to do it again, where will they go?
- Where the money is.

37:34.381 --> 37:37.492
One more time. Then we'll have
enough and we can go.

37:38.755 --> 37:40.027
Martha?

37:41.586 --> 37:43.085
Just one more time.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.702
- Miss Parker.
- Mr Turnbull. Thank goodness!

37:48.728 --> 37:50.141
Let's have a look, shall we?

38:14.435 --> 38:15.900
No!

38:19.298 --> 38:20.978
Go, Martha. Run!

38:24.780 --> 38:26.098
Wendy, love.

38:30.495 --> 38:31.761
Martha!

38:36.740 --> 38:39.140
You are already in an
awful lot of trouble.

38:43.642 --> 38:44.889
Come on now.

39:10.489 --> 39:13.289
Martha, stop! There's no point!

39:21.450 --> 39:22.785
It's over.

39:33.530 --> 39:35.044
Come on.

39:37.470 --> 39:41.790
Martha Bennett, I'm arresting you for armed
robbery and for the murder of Walter Dunn.

39:41.816 --> 39:44.016
You're not obliged to say anything...

39:55.061 --> 39:57.130
We met on a Sunday-school trip.

39:59.159 --> 40:01.159
A day out to the Crystal Palace.

40:03.220 --> 40:05.530
The whole world in one place.

40:09.931 --> 40:11.420
We bought each other these.

40:12.580 --> 40:14.527
We said we'd go there one day.

40:15.244 --> 40:16.755
Drink champagne.

40:17.997 --> 40:19.837
Wear lovely dresses.

40:20.972 --> 40:22.972
Dance with handsome men.

40:25.731 --> 40:27.453
That's not real life though, is it?

40:27.968 --> 40:29.516
It wasn't just once.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.500
It was every day.

40:34.448 --> 40:35.557
He was...

40:36.462 --> 40:38.085
touching me and...

40:43.587 --> 40:45.540
You know you want to.
I think about you...

40:46.540 --> 40:48.157
What are you gonna do with that, girl?

40:48.256 --> 40:51.124
Eh? What are you gonna do, eh? Huh?

40:58.682 --> 41:00.089
You killed.

41:00.684 --> 41:01.928
I'm sorry.

41:04.222 --> 41:05.673
I'm so sorry.

41:07.685 --> 41:09.071
He deserved it.

41:10.709 --> 41:12.362
He deserved what he got.

41:12.574 --> 41:14.083
Wednesday night...

41:15.135 --> 41:16.580
Martha phones you.

41:17.199 --> 41:20.112
She was crying so much she
couldn't get the words out.

41:20.138 --> 41:21.497
We have to go.

41:30.800 --> 41:35.162
You terrorised people. You set up an
innocent woman, a grieving widow.

41:36.102 --> 41:39.896
I made the plans. I told her what to do.

41:39.987 --> 41:43.646
- You shot your own father.
- You don't know what he's like.

41:44.689 --> 41:46.104
It's rules.

41:46.892 --> 41:48.128
And fear.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.016
And 'don't get excited'.

41:53.299 --> 41:55.133
I have no life.

41:57.155 --> 41:58.806
We were gonna go to Paris.

42:00.485 --> 42:04.987
Like we always said. If you're
alive, it's never too late.

42:05.340 --> 42:08.917
As long as it's still beating,
it's never too late.

42:13.007 --> 42:15.447
Mrs Goodheart has invited us for tea.

42:15.758 --> 42:17.554
You're quite the celebrity!

42:18.553 --> 42:20.393
Hilary, I do think about you.

42:22.793 --> 42:25.459
Often, as it happens.

42:26.595 --> 42:27.810
I'm so glad.

42:28.384 --> 42:29.890
I once said that...

42:30.558 --> 42:34.102
- contentment is...
- A gift hard won.

42:34.128 --> 42:36.728
I remember. I thought it was beautiful.

42:36.824 --> 42:40.144
The thing is, maybe it shouldn't
be... difficult.

42:40.866 --> 42:42.432
To be content.

42:44.749 --> 42:46.749
With you, I don't find it difficult.

42:48.626 --> 42:51.042
We have a nice time, don't we?

42:51.649 --> 42:52.648
And...

42:53.438 --> 42:55.908
we never run out of things to say and...

42:57.810 --> 43:00.263
Sorry, I'm not making much sense.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.809
No, no, you are. You're
making perfect sense.

43:08.415 --> 43:12.180
I'd be very pleased... if you said yes.

43:15.732 --> 43:16.826
Yes.

43:42.017 --> 43:48.520
Happiness, not in another place,
but this place.

43:49.920 --> 43:53.505
Not for another hour, but this hour.

43:55.652 --> 43:58.212
We waste so much of our life.

43:59.105 --> 44:01.541
This gift that God has given us.

44:03.990 --> 44:05.942
We worry about our futures.

44:09.109 --> 44:11.109
We dwell on our pasts.

44:14.197 --> 44:16.452
We have grand dreams.

44:16.478 --> 44:18.478
We make great plans.

44:22.289 --> 44:25.169
But how many of us can say
we see them through?

44:27.325 --> 44:29.725
This is the life we are here for.

44:30.887 --> 44:33.087
Not yesterday. Not tomorrow.

44:33.113 --> 44:36.513
Now. This is the life we are here for.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.052
We owe it to ourselves to live it.
