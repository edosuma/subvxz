00:08.840 --> 00:11.161
How the fuck does
something like this happen?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.802
How does an elephant just die?

00:14.120 --> 00:17.044
He was very old and depressed.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.409
He'd recently been rescued from the circus,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.370
but as it turns out,
he actually really loved performing.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.249
Who gives a fuck about the elephant?

00:24.600 --> 00:27.285
What about me? This does not look good.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.931
I'm having a bit of trouble
figuring out how to remove him.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.526
- He weighs 9,000 pounds.
- Cut it up.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.725
Take it out in pieces.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.486
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I could call in a personal favor

00:38.600 --> 00:42.161
and get a helo crew out of Travis AFB
with a Sikorsky Skycrane to airlift it out

00:42.240 --> 00:43.765
and drop it in the ocean right after dark.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.645
No muss, no fuss.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.643
There. Was that so hard, Patrice?
Because Hoover sure didn't think so.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.803
I mean, I just found my footing again,

00:52.160 --> 00:55.323
and you put me in danger of losing it all
over some fucking elephant?

00:56.640 --> 00:59.928
Gavin, you always said that here at Hooli,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.891
in order to achieve greatness,
we must first achieve goodness.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.161
Right.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.164
- So?
- So...

01:08.880 --> 01:11.247
I was a bridesmaid at Sean Parker's wedding

01:11.320 --> 01:14.244
when he handed out live bunnies
as plush toys.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.641
That wasn't goodness.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.246
It was badness.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.001
And so is this.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.327
You're using endangered animals
just to make points at board meetings.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.131
I'm drawing thoughtful,
zoological comparisons.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.969
But couldn't you just show them
a picture of these animals?

01:30.040 --> 01:33.044
A simple Hooli search
would yield thousands of choices.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.966
Patrice, I thank you for your honesty,
and I will repay you with my own.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.402
I honestly never want to see you
in my offices again.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.921
You're fired.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.565
- Hoover, scramble that Skycrane.
- Yes, sir.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.011
Please, come in. Come in. Have a seat.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.965
I won't take a lot of your time. I promise.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.528
- Okay.
- Would you like some tea?

02:05.880 --> 02:07.405
I can put a kettle on the hot plate.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.125
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.
- There's no trouble.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.487
You know what,
I have a box of Russell Stovers

02:13.880 --> 02:16.850
-if the spiders didn't get into 'em.
- Jared, is this about the fake users?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.241
You know?

02:20.320 --> 02:23.403
Two days ago, I wanted to look at
user behavior to figure out

02:23.480 --> 02:26.529
what spurred the sudden uptick,
and well, I noticed something.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.561
Almost all of our new users were
just uploading a single photo

02:30.640 --> 02:31.766
into a shared folder,

02:32.080 --> 02:34.003
and then the next day,
they would take the photo out

02:34.080 --> 02:37.402
and then put it back in
the day after that and that's it.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.406
You know, just enough to qualify
as a daily active user.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.005
Classic click-farm behavior.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.684
And then I remembered our conversation
in the bathtub,

02:43.760 --> 02:45.762
and it just had to be you.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.242
Richard, I am so sorry.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.250
- It's okay.
- Would it make you feel better to...

02:50.320 --> 02:52.049
-...to strike me?
- No.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.691
You had good intentions, Jared.
Honestly, don't give it another thought.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.125
Just, you know...

02:56.840 --> 03:00.447
You and I right now are the only ones
that know about it, okay?

03:01.280 --> 03:03.123
And in a few weeks,
when we run out of money,

03:03.200 --> 03:04.486
this will all be over anyway.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.768
- Richard?
- Yes?

03:08.760 --> 03:10.125
We have a secret.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.886
Yeah.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.966
I mean, I swear to God,

03:16.040 --> 03:18.486
your dicks would have blown
out of the back of your assholes

03:18.560 --> 03:20.369
if you had been there, hand to God.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.683
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- Richard, sit down. I did it.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.490
I saved the company.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.450
What do you... What? How?

03:27.840 --> 03:31.049
- Jared, have you been crying?
- Yes, but for ordinary reasons.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.885
- Please, go on.
- Okay.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.450
I was at The Rosewood for lunch.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.046
I mean, it was the lunch hour.
I was there, I wasn't eating, the usual.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.407
So, I walk over to Andreessen
and I say something funny,

03:39.480 --> 03:41.528
but he stone-faces me.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.287
What did you say?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.362
It doesn't matter.
The point is, it was hilarious,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.886
but he gave me nothing
and neither did his friends.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.243
Then I realized why.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.810
- You're not funny?
- No, Gilfoyle, but that is.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.007
No, it's that everybody thinks
Pied Piper is in this death spiral,

03:58.080 --> 04:00.321
so it would be inappropriate to laugh
at my hysterical joke.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.961
And it hits me.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.211
I know something that they don't.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.768
I know about the uptick.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.688
- The uptick?
- Yes, the uptick.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.442
- The recent sudden surge in users.
- Oh, yeah. That.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.250
Yes, that. So, while our fortune is rising,

04:17.360 --> 04:19.043
everybody else thinks that it's plummeting,

04:19.120 --> 04:22.089
and I can use these opposing forces

04:22.360 --> 04:25.523
to a multiplying effect like a slingshot,
and then I make a decision.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.687
I'm gonna make a move.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.529
So, I say something cryptic about the uptick,
and I walk away.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.842
- What did you say?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.611
But I walk over and I see
McNamee's having the short rib,

04:36.680 --> 04:38.648
which I hear is delicious but not too heavy,

04:38.720 --> 04:39.846
and then I say to him,

04:39.920 --> 04:42.491
"You're gonna have to tuck in your tie-dye
if you want to eat here."

04:44.920 --> 04:46.649
- How's that relevant?
-It's not.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.200
But the people that I just walked away from
don't know that.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.410
All they know is that I'm over there
exchanging witty banter with McNamee,

04:53.520 --> 04:54.931
and about what, they don't know.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.729
It's all that they do want to know.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.804
And then, it settles in.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.726
FOMO.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.809
The fear of missing out.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.202
Suddenly, it feels like time is slowing down.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.851
I could see every move I was going to make,
12 steps ahead.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.571
It was like I was Bobby Fischer
if he could really fuck.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.722
I go outside,
I walk across the street to Greylock,

05:12.800 --> 05:14.086
I check in on Instagram,

05:14.160 --> 05:16.925
Vinod Khosla calls me,
asks me what I doing there.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.401
I say, "I can't talk right now.
Call me at Wood Opal."

05:20.240 --> 05:22.641
Well, he does, and then suddenly
Wood Opal is going,

05:22.720 --> 05:25.041
"What's Khosla got going on with Bachman?"

05:25.120 --> 05:27.771
Meanwhile, I'm taking a leak
at a Restoration Hardware.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.649
I jack off a little bit. I don't cum.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.690
And then it snowballs.

05:31.920 --> 05:35.925
I deftly played Ross Lorna
against Index Ventures.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.890
And because of that, the big kahuna bites.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.161
Sequoia.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.847
I spend the next 20 minutes
denying calls from Jim Goetz,

05:44.920 --> 05:46.331
over and over.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.846
And yes, I'm jacking off,
but I don't need to ejaculate

05:48.920 --> 05:51.400
because by the time I listen to the messages,

05:51.480 --> 05:55.929
I've got offers, I've got counters,
I've got counter-counters.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.327
I cum.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.000
When the dust settled,

06:01.600 --> 06:04.809
and the losers went home,
all that was left was this.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.041
"Hello, Mr. Bachman.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.126
"Coleman Blair Partners
would like to offer Pied Piper

06:11.200 --> 06:14.921
"a Series B round of $6 million

06:15.000 --> 06:17.810
"on a $60 million valuation."

06:18.840 --> 06:19.841
Oh.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.401
Yeah.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.050
Holy shit.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.881
And this asshole wanted
to pivot to video-chat.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.086
Still valid.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.521
Although less sexy now, I'll concede that.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.806
<i>It's my Mona Lisa.</i>

06:32.240 --> 06:34.163
And the entire cornerstone

06:34.640 --> 06:37.530
upon which I built
this motherfucking cathedral

06:37.600 --> 06:39.648
that I will forever be remembered for

06:39.720 --> 06:43.884
was this beautiful little uptick.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.929
I think I have a bottle
of Cold Duck in the crisper.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.331
Who's drinking? Come on!

06:49.400 --> 06:51.050
I got a bottle of Martinelli's for you, Jared.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.600
This is a big day!

06:53.720 --> 06:56.769
We did it! Yes!

06:56.920 --> 06:58.524
- Are there any wine coolers?
- I'll talk to him.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.726
I'll talk 110 him.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.691
Here's my Hooli badge.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.044
And I have a hanging tag

07:05.120 --> 07:07.168
on my rear-view mirror
for the parking structure.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.730
- Can I just mail that in?
- No, you need to go get that now.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.760
Okay.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.806
Hey, Dinesh.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.121
I'm just looking for Erlich.
Have you seen him?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.646
Oh, he went to the liquor store.
Gotta keep the party going, you know?

07:42.720 --> 07:44.563
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Series B. Crazy, right?

07:44.640 --> 07:45.846
- Oh, it's unreal.
- Yeah.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.522
Almost like some of our users.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.961
What?

07:52.240 --> 07:55.289
- What does that mean?
- Oh, "Unreal" has so many meanings.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.408
Fake, paid for,

07:57.480 --> 08:00.370
one person in Bangladesh
pretending to be 6,000.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.570
Okay. Uh...

08:03.440 --> 08:04.726
- All right, Dinesh...
- Oh, no.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.971
I don't want to know a fucking thing.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.886
Okay then. Great.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.128
I won't tell you anything
because nothing happened.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.403
- Great.
- Okay.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.322
But if something did happen,
and we're not saying it did,

08:20.400 --> 08:21.845
the fact remains

08:21.920 --> 08:23.888
that leaves us in
a very advantageous position.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.689
There's a lot of money on the table.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.569
And it would be a shame if that went away.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.801
You know what else
would be a shame...

08:31.080 --> 08:35.369
ls if I couldn't find my flash drive.
Gilfoyle, have you seen my flash drive?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.841
Right, the one with the zombie script on it?

08:37.919 --> 08:41.163
Why, yes, the zombie script
that randomizes user action

08:41.240 --> 08:43.129
in platforms such as Pied Piper.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.647
You mean so that
fake users and click farms would be

08:46.720 --> 08:49.371
absolutely indistinguishable from real users?

08:49.440 --> 08:50.646
Oh, I suppose.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.768
I mean, especially during due diligence,

08:52.840 --> 08:55.571
like the kind done by VCs
or possible future reviews

08:55.680 --> 08:58.411
done by certain regulatory bodies.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.282
It also had photos of my auntie.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.491
- Anyway, Gilfoyle, have you seen it?
- I have not.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.770
Hmm. Well, Richard,
keep an eye out for it, will ya?

09:17.520 --> 09:20.842
Hey, Gilfoyle, you wanna come inside
and help me get a new flash drive

09:20.920 --> 09:24.402
-on www.staples.com?
-Yeah, I think...

09:24.480 --> 09:25.970
-...we're sort of done with the ruse.
- Okay.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.283
Okay, fine.
Well, whatever you did or didn't do,

09:29.920 --> 09:32.400
- that was serial-killer-level shit.
- Agreed.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.962
I think I finally respect you as a CEO.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.641
Fuck.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.005
- This is fraud.
- Is it?

09:53.440 --> 09:56.523
I mean, our platform does
exactly what we say it does.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.443
Okay? It's not like we're lying about it
like fucking Theranos.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.127
And if our platform works,
which we know it will,

10:03.200 --> 10:06.204
we will make them billions of dollars.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.567
Everybody wins, Jared.
You still believe that, right?

10:08.640 --> 10:11.689
That, if given enough time,
the platform will catch on?

10:12.280 --> 10:14.931
Richard, don't weaponize my faith in you
against me.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.890
Your faith made all this possible.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.407
It's wrong.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.289
Well, every time I try to do the right thing,
I get fucked.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.086
And if I do the right thing here,

10:23.880 --> 10:25.006
we're done. That's it.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.650
Doesn't seem like much of an option, does it?

10:30.720 --> 10:32.848
Dang, they're all just so good.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.202
<i>Gavin, CJ Cantwell, line one.</i>

10:36.800 --> 10:38.370
Dang, let's pick this up tomorrow.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.569
- CJ.
- I'm finishing a story I'd love a comment on.

10:44.640 --> 10:49.089
It's about the death of an unpermitted
Indian elephant named Maurice,

10:49.160 --> 10:52.323
in your sculpture garden
and its subsequent illegal dumping

10:52.400 --> 10:53.731
in the San Francisco Bay.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.128
- That's preposterous.
- Mmm, I have a very good source.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.405
What do you propose we do here?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.246
<i>Well, I have one idea.</i>

11:02.840 --> 11:04.410
<i>And what, pray tell, might that be?</i>

11:05.440 --> 11:08.887
CJ sold the blog for $2 million.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.769
No shit.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.606
Bachmanity rides again.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.011
Well, not exactly.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.683
Uh, I called Big Head to tell him that
our share was worth half a mil each,

11:17.960 --> 11:22.443
and not five minutes later,
his father, one Nelson Bighetti Sr.,

11:22.880 --> 11:24.803
called me and explained that
I was never to have

11:24.880 --> 11:29.283
any financial dealings with his son
in perpetuity, ever,

11:29.520 --> 11:31.363
or he would get very Italian on me.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.202
And I'm not interested
to find out what that means.

11:34.720 --> 11:38.088
- Okay. Shall we?
- To Coleman Blair! Let's close this fucker.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.321
Good luck, fellas.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.207
Remember, you just sit there and look pretty.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.530
Leave all the talking to me.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.764
And if you mention my Montblanc,
then don't make it overt, like I told you to.

12:14.840 --> 12:15.921
But do.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.121
Oh.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.767
Hey, what's up?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.888
Are you guys out raising money
from someone else?

12:23.680 --> 12:26.047
Oh, Monica,
it's kind of a long story.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.281
Why are you whispering?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.209
Oh, my God,
you're there right now, aren't you?

12:30.840 --> 12:32.251
Jesus! Do you have any idea

12:32.320 --> 12:34.243
how big of an asshole
you're making me look here?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.527
Laurie just lost her shit at me, okay?

12:36.600 --> 12:38.921
So, you need to turn around
and walk the hell out of there.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.528
Erlich put all this together.
I really had nothing to do with it.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.843
You have everything to do with it.
You're the fucking CEO, Richard.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.890
<i>Whatever your company does is 100% on you.</i>

12:48.120 --> 12:49.201
Gentlemen.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.087
- They're ready for you.
- Oh. Yes. I gotta go.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.288
Do not hang up on me. Richard, do not...

12:57.040 --> 12:58.565
So listen, we're pumped, guys.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.689
We're thrilled to be getting into Pied Piper
right at this inflection point.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.565
- It's very exciting.
- We are pumped as well. Aren't we, Richard?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.850
- Richard. Pumped.
- Hmm? Pumped.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.127
- We are pumped up.
- Pumped up. Mmm-hmm.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.283
So we'll just need
your John Hancock right here.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.842
Oh, sure, Richard. You can use my Montblanc.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.650
Oh, the, uh...

13:18.840 --> 13:23.129
This is an actual term sheet.
And once I sign this... That's it, right?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.531
Yup. No turning back.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.291
You can have your lawyers vet
the actual stock purchase agreement

13:30.360 --> 13:33.045
once we close here just to make sure
no one is pulling any funny business.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.771
- No, no.
- No, my lawyer is in jail, so.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.647
So.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.084
Oh, my God. I, uh...

13:49.520 --> 13:52.205
Wow, I can't believe
I didn't think of this before,

13:52.720 --> 13:54.688
because, well, let me put it to you this way.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.606
What would you say if I told you that
the same compression that you know and love

13:58.680 --> 14:01.889
is being used in a world-beating,
game-changing, wait for it...

14:03.520 --> 14:05.488
Video-conferencing application?

14:06.120 --> 14:08.282
Wouldn't that be interesting?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.683
- What?
- You mean like Hooli-Chat?

14:12.760 --> 14:15.206
This will be far superior to Hooli-Chat.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.044
You may want to fund that instead.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.170
In fact, why don't I just go home,
I'll grab my laptop,

14:20.240 --> 14:21.890
I'll come back here, I'll show it to you guys.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.450
- It's not that far. I don't mind...
- Richard...

14:23.520 --> 14:24.931
- I'll tell you what, I'll grab an Uber.
- No, no, no.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.048
- It's no problem.
- Richard, what the fuck are you doing?

14:27.120 --> 14:28.087
There. I've ordered it.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.367
Neal is in a blue Kia Sportage
and he's right around the corner.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.680
All right, all right. Look, look, look.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.047
I don't know who else you're talking to
about the platform,

14:34.120 --> 14:38.011
but I'm willing to go up to
seven million on 70.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.447
Okay? But that's it.
You sign this thing, right here, right now.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.724
Bravo, Richard. Nice neg.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.321
Now sign it.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.131
Thank you. Very generous of you.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.043
I just want to make sure that
you're aware of all the feedback

14:50.120 --> 14:52.043
'cause we had some focus groups
and there were some issues.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.525
Just so you're clear,

14:54.160 --> 14:56.731
people have been wondering,
"Ah! Where are my files?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.246
- Richard, Richard...
- "Zero K used? Where's the download button?

14:59.320 --> 15:00.970
-"The Terminator..."
- All right, all right, you know what?

15:01.040 --> 15:02.929
-'Cause it...
- I'm gonna sign it. Can I sign it? I'll sign it.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.004
You can if you want,
but we still need his signature.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.885
Richard, sign it.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.084
That's two years of runway.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.691
- Sign it now!
- I can't.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.522
- Why the fuck not?
- Because the numbers are fake.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.041
What?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.683
- What? What do you mean? What do you...
- We bought...

15:26.120 --> 15:29.124
Fake users from a Bangladeshi click farm.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.566
The uptick was fake.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.807
But the vid-chat...

15:37.200 --> 15:38.281
...is real.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.126
Erlich, the fake users were
just meant to cheer the guys up.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.850
I had no idea you were
gonna take those numbers...

15:42.960 --> 15:44.246
And what, and go do my fucking job?

15:44.320 --> 15:46.448
Pour everything I had
into getting the best possible

15:46.520 --> 15:48.648
deal for Pied Piper because I believe in them?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.360
Well, that's all over now.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.807
Richard, we are fucked!

15:53.400 --> 15:56.688
In the amount of time that it took for us to get
from that office to right here,

15:56.760 --> 15:58.603
every VC in the Valley knows about this.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.126
If I signed those term sheets,
I would be committing fraud.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.440
That's a fucking crime.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.846
You're saying you wanted me to...

16:03.920 --> 16:05.843
No, I wanted you to fucking think about that

16:05.920 --> 16:07.922
before you paraded me
around the whole fucking Valley

16:08.000 --> 16:09.445
to sell your lie.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.364
And then suddenly grew
a thick, girthy conscience

16:12.440 --> 16:13.521
and fucked me with it.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.647
Are you Richard?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.925
- Did you order an Uber?
- Oh, no.

16:19.280 --> 16:22.011
All you had to do was
keep your fucking mouth shut

16:22.080 --> 16:23.525
and sign that piece of paper.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.924
We would have fixed it afterwards.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.245
But you didn't. You caked your pants.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.328
No, better yet, you caked my pants.
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.526
Fuck you.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.844
Richard Hendricks, huh?

16:36.920 --> 16:38.251
Prick.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.971
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Monica.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.647
Is Richard here? I heard what happened,
but he's not answering any of my calls.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.449
We just wanted you to know for the record

16:53.520 --> 16:56.842
that we had no idea
any of that stuff was going on.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.570
Still trying to wrap our heads around it.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.806
Point is, don't beat yourself up
about not seeing it.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.689
I'm not beating myself up...

17:03.760 --> 17:05.922
I hope you don't think
we're guilty by association,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.526
because then we would have to think
you're guilty by association.

17:08.760 --> 17:09.761
Which We don't.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.207
Just want to let you know
that we would definitely work

17:12.280 --> 17:13.724
with you again in the future.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.962
It's good to know, guys. Thanks.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.280
Um, is he in his room?

17:18.359 --> 17:20.488
I mean, he said he was.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.961
But...

17:24.640 --> 17:26.243
I'm gonna go to his room.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.406
Mmm-hmm.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.841
Ugh!

17:30.240 --> 17:31.241
What's up, Gleb?

17:31.360 --> 17:33.567
<i>I hear Richard shit bed, huh?</i>

17:34.640 --> 17:37.484
<i>So, the platform is no---</i>

17:37.960 --> 17:39.962
Fuck, now the vid-chat's fucking up.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.241
Odd, considering who wrote the code for it.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.482
Not the code. The server is overloaded.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.201
How is that possible?
We only gave it to, like, 12 people.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.291
Well, there's a few more than that
using it now.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.447
Holy shit.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.331
For what it's worth, Richard,
I think you did the right thing.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.765
And I can see now why you didn't
want to come to us for funding.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.285
You were trying to protect us.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.846
Yeah.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.690
Well, I really appreciate it.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.841
Uh...

18:05.920 --> 18:07.206
Laurie wants out.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.083
Even a whiff of fraud is a mortal sin for VCs.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.007
She needs to wash her hands
of any Pied Piper business.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.481
She's forcing a sale.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.321
Fuck.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.045
Yeah, frick.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.001
Yeah.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.451
But it is an open auction,

18:22.520 --> 18:24.648
and, you know,
between the fraudulent numbers

18:24.720 --> 18:27.451
and the real numbers,

18:27.520 --> 18:29.443
you guys aren't exactly killing it out there.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.682
So, there is a chance that no one will bid

18:31.760 --> 18:33.489
and you might be able to
buy back your own company

18:33.560 --> 18:34.721
for next to nothing.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.765
That will have to be for literally nothing
because we're out of money.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.681
Ow!

18:44.040 --> 18:45.371
Jesus! Are you okay?

18:45.720 --> 18:46.846
Yeah, we're fine.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.802
All right, I spun together a few more servers.
That should handle the traffic.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.641
Look at this.
There are 157 people using it near Gleb.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.371
And 400 people using it near Tara in Boston.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.888
Yeah, I told her to give it to
her Satanist friends out there.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.526
Looks like she did.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.171
She knows 400 Satanists in Boston?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.687
The Catholic church really did
a number on that town.

19:10.400 --> 19:15.088
Hey, Erlich, remember when Gilfoyle said that
my video-chat app was a piece of shit

19:15.160 --> 19:16.685
and that nobody would ever use it?

19:17.080 --> 19:20.243
Well, he was wrong. Over 4,000 times. Tsk.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.530
Wow. And you developed that
with the Pied Piper IP, right?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.765
Well, then you can kiss that goodbye.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.161
Oh, fuck.

19:28.240 --> 19:32.928
Speaking of, I'm actually using
the first dollars of my blog windfall

19:33.000 --> 19:35.128
on a trip to Kainchi Dham Ashram

19:35.200 --> 19:37.009
in Nainital, India,

19:37.080 --> 19:41.563
where Steve Jobs famously sought peace
and came up with the idea

19:41.640 --> 19:43.449
for a little product he called

19:43.920 --> 19:44.967
the Lisa.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.807
Good luck.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.123
Richard, I'll expect you off the premises
by end of day.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.125
Monica.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.845
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.049
You know, you can stay here for one year.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.528
- Free rent.
- Jian-Yang!

20:06.840 --> 20:08.001
Laurie.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.321
Oh.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.161
Gavin.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.480
You know Jack, of course.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.611
That is correct.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.521
Gavin, can we address
the elephant in the room?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.729
- Sorry?
- Pied Piper.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.243
Right. Yes, of course.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.322
I am forcing a sale.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.930
Your Maleant dealings demonstrate
that you're still pursuing middle-out.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.929
Might you be interested in placing a bid?

20:32.040 --> 20:33.963
Why would he want to bail out Raviga?

20:34.040 --> 20:37.328
You said it yourself,
our compression play is thriving.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.844
- Fair enough.
- You know what? I'm a completionist.

20:41.320 --> 20:45.166
Even if I buy it just to throw it in the garbage,
I'd like to be the one to drive the final nail

20:45.240 --> 20:46.526
in the Hendricks coffin.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.846
I'll give you...

20:49.200 --> 20:50.645
Nine hundred dollars for it?

20:51.320 --> 20:53.243
- I believe that is a joke.
- You know what?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.284
I like nice, round numbers.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.246
Make it...

20:58.200 --> 20:59.486
A million?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.486
A million dollars?

21:01.560 --> 21:05.281
Gavin Belson gets to buy
Pied Piper for a million dollars

21:05.360 --> 21:08.250
and Raviga gets all of it because
of their liquidation preference

21:08.320 --> 21:09.446
and I get jack shit?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.363
Is that what you're telling me? God damn it.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.087
<i>I know this is the last way
that you wanted it to end.</i>

21:14.400 --> 21:15.561
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

21:15.640 --> 21:17.927
Yeah, well, I'll see you at the meeting.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.766
Is that Hooli-Chat?

21:20.200 --> 21:22.282
They fix it or something?
That didn't look shitty at all.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.404
Actually, it's ours.
The guys hacked it together.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.245
- I can send you an invite if you want.
- Yeah. Cool. Thanks.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.449
- We got up to 4K users totally organically.
- Oh.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.244
Oh, shit, 7K now.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.560
Wow, we should have been
focusing on this instead.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.807
Not that it matters.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.724
I mean, it's all gonna be property
of Gavin Belson in an hour, so.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.400
That's ironic, huh?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.050
No, for real, I'm asking. Is it?

21:46.920 --> 21:48.160
I don't know. I was just smiling.

21:48.920 --> 21:49.967
Feels ironic.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.729
Hey, so thank you for...

21:54.240 --> 21:55.844
- Letting me stay here.
- No worries.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.928
Steve says you're welcome to
take my spot on the couch

21:58.000 --> 22:00.571
until you can find a job
and get your own place.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.846
Thanks.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.287
So, when's your dad coming to pick you up?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.366
A couple of hours, I guess.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.330
Then we're turning right around
and going back to Phoenix.

22:09.400 --> 22:13.166
You know, he said he wants to be able
to keep an eye on me and my money

22:13.240 --> 22:17.006
and that I need to get a real job
to learn the value of a hard day's night

22:17.080 --> 22:18.445
or something like that.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.971
Well, I should probably get going
to this board meeting.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.604
And you're probably gonna be gone
when I'm back, so...

22:26.840 --> 22:28.649
- Guess this is it.
- Yeah, I guess so.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.087
See ya.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.521
Oh...

22:32.400 --> 22:33.765
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.888
- All right. Cool, man.
- There we go.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.526
Richard, even though
it's the last board meeting

22:46.600 --> 22:48.364
and essentially meaningless,

22:49.280 --> 22:52.045
thank you for letting me be a part of it.
It's an honor.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.204
Okay, you don't have to keep saying that.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.644
Good day, all. This should be brief.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.647
The only item on the agenda is,
of course, the authorization

23:02.720 --> 23:04.529
of the sale of Pied Piper
to the current high bidder.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.409
Three "yes" votes will approve the sale.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.131
And as Raviga controls
three of the board seats,

23:09.240 --> 23:10.571
-it seems...
- I'm sorry.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.842
- I'm not doing it.
- Oh, Monica, not again.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.321
I'm sorry, but look,
Richard has worked too hard

23:17.400 --> 23:19.562
and I know that I can't stop it,
but I'm not gonna vote

23:19.640 --> 23:22.041
to let Pied Piper become
the property of that asshole.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.602
Monica, I also happen
to find him contemptible.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.651
But Pied Piper will be sold
to the high bidder, period.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.000
You know what? I don't care.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.085
You want to fire me, fire me.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.687
If we're not gonna adhere to the values
that Peter Gregory instilled,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.401
-then I don't think I belong here.
- Monica, you don't have to do this.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.602
- I'm not voting yes.
- Very well. You're off the board.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.444
Excuse me. Man.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.766
- Do you work here?
- Well, it was my first day actually.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.524
- Everybody's been super...
- Sit.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.490
You are now officially on
the board of directors of Pied Piper.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.925
- Oh, okay. That's fine I guess...
- When I point to you, you will vote yes.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.207
Now, I move to vote on the sale of Pied Piper.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.646
I vote yes.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.847
- I vote yes.
- And Evan.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.281
Evan?

24:08.840 --> 24:11.127
- I can't do it.
- What? Why?

24:11.520 --> 24:12.726
Because“.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.081
Monica?

24:16.360 --> 24:17.566
I love you.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.130
There. I said it.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.325
And I could never do anything
to make you sad.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.801
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Do I have to pull the receptionist in here?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.882
How does this compare
with a typical board meeting?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.770
All right, stop. Everybody, just stop.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.888
We all know how this is gonna go,
so let's just get it over with.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.007
All right?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.571
I vote yes. There. Okay? I approve the sale.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.400
Three "yes" votes.
Can this please just be done?

24:38.720 --> 24:39.721
Very well.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.370
- I vote yes also.
-Irrelevant.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.721
- But thank you.
- The sale is approved.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.121
Pied Piper, its IP, and all of its assets

24:47.200 --> 24:49.806
are now officially the property
of Bachmanity, LLC.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.768
Wait, sorry, did...

24:54.400 --> 24:56.243
Did you just say "Bachmanity"?

24:57.520 --> 25:01.161
- As in Erlich Bachman and Nelson Bighetti?
- Yes, you know them.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.441
Wait, they had the highest bid?

25:05.240 --> 25:08.369
I received a telephone call
approximately 30 minutes ago

25:08.440 --> 25:11.683
entering a bid of one million and one dollars
with a firm no-shop clause.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.003
So, when you were referring to
the person who bought Pied Piper

25:15.080 --> 25:18.971
as a contemptible asshole,
you were talking about Erlich?

25:19.760 --> 25:22.923
To which contemptible asshole
did you think I was referring?

25:23.520 --> 25:24.521
Gavin Belson.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.961
Oh.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.930
I see. No.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.083
This meeting is adjourned.
I thank you all for your time.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.251
So, Bachmanity it is.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.331
That's good.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.651
So, should we give this thing a shot?

25:59.320 --> 26:00.970
You and Big Head, huh?

26:03.560 --> 26:04.561
Um...

26:05.160 --> 26:07.401
Sorry you had to cancel your trip.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.801
And look, I really appreciate all this.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.881
I really think this video-chat thing
is gonna be something, you know?

26:14.960 --> 26:17.008
- I don't know if you've seen the numbers.
- You want a number?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.446
The percentage I give a fuck about you, zero.

26:20.760 --> 26:21.841
It's trending steady.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.770
And of course I've seen the numbers.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.722
This is a business opportunity. Nothing more.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.289
Big Head was your friend.
He was the one that talked me into it.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.490
I don't trust you, Richard Hendricks.

26:36.360 --> 26:40.763
And it's gonna take a long, long, long time
to regain my trust.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.361
Are we clear?

26:44.520 --> 26:47.410
Are we absolutely clear...

26:47.480 --> 26:50.689
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!

26:50.760 --> 26:52.444
Always blue! Always blue!

26:52.520 --> 26:53.681
Always blue!

26:55.480 --> 26:58.529
- You suck.
- Oh, fuck, it's my dad again.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.770
He's gotta be so pissed.
I can't believe this is happening, you guys.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.968
I mean, I guess now
we're a video-chat company,

27:04.040 --> 27:06.168
but the best part of it is it's us, you know?

27:06.240 --> 27:08.129
Just us controlling our own destiny.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.044
No, the best part of it is that I own 50%.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.529
Well, yes, you and Big Head
do own the entire company,

27:14.600 --> 27:16.489
but I am the founder, it's my algorithm,

27:16.560 --> 27:18.881
so I'm assuming I'm getting
my original shares back, right?

27:18.960 --> 27:20.450
Why would you assume that?

27:20.520 --> 27:24.002
Well, when a tech company reboots,
it's normal to have a conversation

27:24.120 --> 27:25.849
about restructuring the cap table.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.003
Good, 'cause I'm the guy that hacked together
the video-chat app

27:29.080 --> 27:31.082
to see if that woman was hot, so...

27:31.400 --> 27:35.166
Yeah, but it's not gonna scale until
I get in there and scrape all the Dinesh off.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.369
Well, Laurie still hasn't called me back,
so I may need a new job.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.605
And I'm assuming Pied Piper
can't afford my salary,

27:41.720 --> 27:43.085
so I'll need stock.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.209
Do we really want it to be called
Pied Piper anymore?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.362
No, yes, of course. Of course we want...

27:48.440 --> 27:50.169
Why do we want to change the name?
It's great.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.481
Yeah, and we do already have the jackets.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.086
Big. Head.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.601
Big Head.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.807
Go for Erlich.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.884
Erlich Bachman, this is you as an old man.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.082
I'm ugly and I'm dead. Alone.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.406
I'm gonna let him have this one. All right...

28:11.480 --> 28:14.450
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, future me.
What a terrible thing.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.090
I'll talk to you in several years.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.207
You're up.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.203
Always blue! Always blue!

28:19.280 --> 28:23.365
Always blue! Always blue!

28:23.440 --> 28:26.171
Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!
