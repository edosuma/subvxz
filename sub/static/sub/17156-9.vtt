Oh, I just love that old burro.

11:53.279 --> 11:57.347
I'm sorry, Stephen, I guess
I assumed you were a pony.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.718
And I had no idea you had
such adventures together.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.554
Oh, honey! You don't
know the half of it.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.255
But let me tell you something:

12:05.257 --> 12:07.224
in all that we've been
through together,

12:07.226 --> 12:11.195
the only thing he ever
cared about was finding you.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.464
Really?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.366
Well, that and a
baldness cure. [giggle]

He is the sweetest
thing, isn't he?

12:19.271 --> 12:21.572

put myself through.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.440
All the stress I've
put him through!

12:23.442 --> 12:27.211
The only thing that matters
is that we're together.

12:27.213 --> 12:30.447
The wedding isn't the important
thing; the marriage is.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.383
Oh, my goodness gracious!

12:33.385 --> 12:37.354

got a bridge to sell you!

And you're not the only one
with a secret, you know.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.352
You know those
expensive imported oats

17:35.354 --> 17:38.021
you were saving for
a special occasion?

17:38.023 --> 17:41.358
I cooked them up and
ate them. All of them.

It's sort of thrilling to reveal
your deepest, darkest secrets!

As I look around this room,
I can only imagine

19:04.643 --> 19:07.644
how uncomfortable
Cranky must be.

from all trots of life

19:17.956 --> 19:20.991

19:20.993 --> 19:23.627
Cranky searched all across
this great land of ours

19:23.629 --> 19:25.562
to find Matilda.

19:25.564 --> 19:28.298
And no matter what
obstacles kept them apart,

19:28.300 --> 19:30.967
love would finally
bring them together,

19:30.969 --> 19:34.671
just as it has brought
all of us together now.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.607
It's remarkable to
me how a story

19:37.609 --> 19:39.743
like Cranky's search for
Matilda could fill this room

19:39.745 --> 19:42.345
with such a unique
collection of ponies.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.048
It makes you realize
that everypony

19:45.050 --> 19:48.018
is the star of their own story.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.587
And it's not just the main
characters in our stories

19:50.589 --> 19:52.622
that make life so rich.

19:52.624 --> 19:56.259
It's everypony, those
who play big parts

19:56.261 --> 19:59.262
and those who play small.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.599
If it weren't for
everypony in this room

20:02.601 --> 20:04.534

couldn't be here today,

20:04.536 --> 20:07.304

wouldn't be as full

20:07.306 --> 20:09.472

these loved ones...

20:16.615 --> 20:22.118
Cranky, do you take this donkey
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

20:22.120 --> 20:24.187
You bet I do.

20:24.189 --> 20:27.224
And do you, Matilda,
take this donkey

20:27.226 --> 20:29.426
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

20:30.695 --> 20:32.462
I do.
