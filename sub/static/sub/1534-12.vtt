00:18.845 --> 00:20.531
Wow, that is a lot of ice.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.323
And it's time for it to come down.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.446
Okay. Now can we go back home?

00:46.514 --> 00:47.914
Stop! Don't take another step!

00:47.982 --> 00:49.816
That's the town line.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.184
Right.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.220
But I want to leave the town.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.454
Didn't I just say that?

00:54.522 --> 00:55.789
The wall may be down,

00:55.857 --> 00:58.692
but I sense that some of
Ingrid's magic remains.

01:03.865 --> 01:07.200
Yeah, leaving this town
has never been simple.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.668
And Ingrid? She didn't change things.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.337
She wanted to be here
alone with you and me.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.005
She wanted to make
Storybrooke her ice castle,

01:12.073 --> 01:13.607
and clearly she wanted to protect it.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.442
So how do we get back home?

01:15.509 --> 01:17.177
Walking wouldn't get us there anyway.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.712
We're in a different realm.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.213
We need to find a portal.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.082
Or magic beans or something.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.316
Okay, now I'm lost.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.051
Well, then let's get one of those things.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.252
We have to hurry.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.955
No, we don't need to rush.
We need to be careful.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.324
Arendelle will still be there
while we figure this out.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.559
It might not.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.027
Did we forget to tell her?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.762
A lot of stuff was going on. Tell me what?

01:35.830 --> 01:38.465
Arendelle's been conquered...

01:38.532 --> 01:40.467
by Hans and his 12 brothers.

01:40.534 --> 01:45.705
Emma, we need to find a way back... Now.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.041
We'll do our best.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.782
They didn't leave.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.550
The Snow Queen mucked up the border.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.353
Once you cross, there's
no c... coming back.

02:05.092 --> 02:08.061
If only the Snow Queen had succeeded...

02:08.127 --> 02:09.895
Everything would be much simpler.

02:09.963 --> 02:10.896
Yes.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.366
Perfect cover for your exit.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.735
But everybody survived.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.637
Sorry for the inconvenience.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.439
What about our friends from Arendelle?

02:19.506 --> 02:21.307
Well, they're still
searching for a portal back.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.442
Well, that is a problem.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.913
Can't have that Anna running around town.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.549
She knows, doesn't she?

02:29.616 --> 02:32.251
She knows what you were doing,

02:32.319 --> 02:33.920
cleaving yourself from the dagger

02:33.987 --> 02:35.621
so you can leave with your power.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.725
Emma told me Belle
confessed about knowing Anna.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.129
Still, quite the supposition.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.197
Why else would you care?

02:45.265 --> 02:48.034
Anna's a danger to you.

02:48.101 --> 02:51.303
You can't have your
blissfully ignorant wife...

02:51.371 --> 02:53.372
lose either her bliss or ignorance.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.874
Watch Anna.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.876
Make sure she comes nowhere near this shop.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.178
But if I had the choice well, you don't.

02:59.246 --> 03:03.315
Your usefulness was unexpectedly extended.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.818
But tonight, when the stars in the sky

03:05.886 --> 03:08.254
align with the stars in the sorcerer's hat,

03:08.321 --> 03:12.558
I will finally do what I should
have done so many years ago.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.294
I will crush your heart.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.997
And while I'm out doing your dirty work,

03:18.064 --> 03:19.898
what are you gonna do?

03:22.435 --> 03:24.870
I'm simply gonna wake my wife

03:24.938 --> 03:27.239
and prepare her for my greatest gift.

03:27.307 --> 03:31.210
She's gonna have the
life she always wanted.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.000
Don't cut yourself, deary! Aah!

03:55.068 --> 03:57.869
I am so, so sorry. I thought...

03:57.937 --> 04:01.506
you thought I would be
away for a few more days

04:01.574 --> 04:04.643
and it would be fine
to play with my... Toys.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.178
Well, you did say that...

04:06.245 --> 04:08.714
oh! I lied.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.016
I wanted to see how the mouse would play

04:11.084 --> 04:13.218
while the cat was away.

04:13.286 --> 04:17.988
And the mouse has done
very little... Cleaning.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.524
You just have...

04:19.591 --> 04:22.828
you have so many things
here from all over the world.

04:22.895 --> 04:23.962
I was curious.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.199
And... You never talk about them.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.334
Well, you're the help.

04:32.667 --> 04:33.791
And you're rude.

04:33.893 --> 04:36.294
Well, I could be much worse.

04:36.362 --> 04:37.462
Hmm.

04:37.530 --> 04:39.464
But you're not.

04:39.532 --> 04:43.301
Look, you have seen the world...

04:43.369 --> 04:45.370
something that I've always wanted to do...

04:45.438 --> 04:47.372
yet you share nothing.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.107
Mouthy, mouthy.

04:49.175 --> 04:51.343
And foolishly brave.

04:51.410 --> 04:54.679
No, if you were going to kill me,

04:54.747 --> 04:56.681
you would have done it long ago.

04:56.749 --> 04:59.718
Now, tell me what you've seen.

04:59.785 --> 05:02.654
- How was your trip to Camelot?
- Good for me.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.270
Not so good for Camelot.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.442
A souvenir.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.578
Clean it for me, will you?

05:12.645 --> 05:13.946
Oh.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.881
W-w-what
is it?

05:15.949 --> 05:19.451
It's a magic gauntlet
with a very specific power.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.754
It can locate anyone's greatest weakness.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.790
Hmm. How ominous.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.591
B-but why do you need this?

05:26.659 --> 05:30.996
W-with all your power,
you could destroy any foe.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.266
Look, if you must know,
it's about manipulation.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.437
And for that, you must find one's weakness.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.938
And for almost everyone,

05:40.006 --> 05:42.974
that weakness is the thing they love most.

05:43.042 --> 05:47.012
This will simply point
me in the right direction.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.587
Whoa.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.757
Breakfast in bed, huh?

05:58.824 --> 06:01.960
I have a much bigger
surprise coming for you.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.396
I think it's about time
we had a proper honeymoon.

06:10.831 --> 06:14.100
How would you like to see a
magical city called New York?

06:16.103 --> 06:18.938
So, after breakfast, pack a suitcase.

06:19.006 --> 06:22.742
It's time for you to see the world.

06:57.904 --> 06:59.538
Oh!

07:17.798 --> 07:19.850
Please, I'd rather be alone.

07:19.850 --> 07:21.342
I thought we should talk.

07:24.009 --> 07:27.412
Thank you for saving my
life... twice, actually.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.948
Forget about it.

07:30.015 --> 07:34.018
I can't because Robin can't.

07:34.086 --> 07:37.222
I see the way you two look at one another.

07:37.289 --> 07:39.958
And I understand.

07:40.025 --> 07:41.793
For me,

07:42.567 --> 07:44.956
it's only been a short
time that I've been away.

07:45.445 --> 07:48.255
But for him, years have passed.

07:48.774 --> 07:50.192
His heart moved on.

07:51.557 --> 07:53.692
He's in love with you, Regina.

07:53.759 --> 07:56.528
And I think you're in love with him.

07:58.464 --> 08:00.799
Well, it doesn't really matter.

08:00.867 --> 08:02.067
He's a man of honor.

08:02.134 --> 08:05.170
He made a vow to you,
and he's going to keep it.

08:05.238 --> 08:07.272
I don't want him to be
with me out of obligation.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.840
I want to be chosen.

08:08.908 --> 08:11.009
If his heart leads him to me, fine.

08:11.077 --> 08:13.712
But if it does what I
suspect and leads to you...

08:15.514 --> 08:17.816
I will step out of the way.

08:36.075 --> 08:39.244
You may have got the best
of me this time, dark one,

08:39.312 --> 08:42.381
but I promise you, in the next life,

08:42.448 --> 08:44.049
it won't be so pleasant for you.

08:44.116 --> 08:47.052
Well, then, given my immortality,

08:47.120 --> 08:49.087
you'll have quite the wait

08:49.155 --> 08:51.390
amongst the fire and brimstone.

08:51.457 --> 08:53.859
If I really am to die,

08:53.927 --> 08:56.061
at least give me all the information.

08:56.129 --> 08:58.263
Whose house is this?

08:58.331 --> 09:00.098
A powerful sorcerer.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.934
He brought the Snow Queen
from Arendelle to this world,

09:03.002 --> 09:04.503
which means his magic is strong enough

09:04.570 --> 09:06.705
to move between that world and ours.

09:06.773 --> 09:09.441
There's a portal around here somewhere.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.410
We simply need to find it.

09:18.384 --> 09:20.118
There.

09:33.735 --> 09:36.337
Hey, grandma.

09:36.404 --> 09:38.339
Are you taking a trip?

09:40.742 --> 09:42.109
Uh, yeah.

09:42.177 --> 09:45.412
Rumple's taking me to New
York for our honeymoon.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.848
But the Snow Queen left
a spell on the town line.

09:47.916 --> 09:49.067
Anyone who goes can't return.

09:49.510 --> 09:51.277
Didn't you hear?

09:51.345 --> 09:53.279
No, I-I-I didn't.

09:53.347 --> 09:56.783
But I'm sure he must
have a way to remove it.

09:58.319 --> 10:01.688
Hey, what's wrong?

10:01.755 --> 10:03.957
This book.

10:04.024 --> 10:06.292
It's got all your stories in it.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.728
It started all this.

10:08.796 --> 10:11.030
And my mom...

10:12.033 --> 10:14.801
lots of bad things happen to her in it.

10:14.869 --> 10:16.303
Well, that doesn't mean

10:16.371 --> 10:18.538
they'll always happen to her that way.

10:18.606 --> 10:20.140
I... I wouldn't worry.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.843
She's on a much better path now.

10:22.910 --> 10:24.778
Thanks, grandma.

10:24.846 --> 10:28.982
Yeah, you know... "Belle's" good.

10:30.652 --> 10:32.052
Got it.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.856
Okay, so, I need another suitcase.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.197
Help me look?

10:45.017 --> 10:46.411
You know, when you're in New York,

10:46.411 --> 10:48.086
you've got to go to the public library.

10:48.463 --> 10:50.202
No offense, but it blows the one here away.

10:50.505 --> 10:52.263
It's got these lions outside of it...

10:54.091 --> 10:56.526
Aah! Are you okay?

10:56.594 --> 10:58.495
Sorry. Let me get those.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.768
Huh.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.870
He really keeps some strange things here.

11:10.741 --> 11:12.742
What's wrong? I'll clean it up.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.944
N-no, no. It's... it's okay.

11:15.012 --> 11:17.714
I-I got it.

11:19.350 --> 11:24.020
I just, uh, didn't expect to see this here.

11:30.672 --> 11:34.141
So, I figured it out...

11:34.209 --> 11:37.011
why you collect so many magical objects.

11:37.079 --> 11:38.433
You have a hole in your heart.

11:38.642 --> 11:40.954
There's only one thing
missing from my life right now.

11:42.245 --> 11:44.113
Clean clothes.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.822
You're just upset because
you know I'm right.

11:53.890 --> 11:57.126
And no, I am not talking to myself

11:57.193 --> 12:01.163
because I know you can and do listen to me.

12:13.610 --> 12:15.878
Hello, puppy.

12:15.945 --> 12:17.012
Hi.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.180
Hi.

12:35.116 --> 12:37.891
Gah! Where did you go?

12:46.302 --> 12:47.348
Swan.

12:48.833 --> 12:49.852
Come celebrate,

12:50.490 --> 12:52.658
for I may not be the savior,

12:52.725 --> 12:54.092
but I've just saved the day.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.462
Hang on. Don't get your hopes up yet.

12:57.530 --> 12:59.031
Okay.

12:59.098 --> 13:02.267
What, exactly, are we celebrating?

13:02.335 --> 13:04.503
The portal to Arendelle.

13:04.570 --> 13:08.006
I found it.

13:08.074 --> 13:10.809
So, bottoms up.

13:13.079 --> 13:16.548
You... Found a portal?

13:16.616 --> 13:17.883
Well, I found Gold,

13:18.547 --> 13:20.348
and he told me where to locate one.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.118
A door in the ballroom
of that lakeside mansion.

13:23.185 --> 13:24.285
Yes.

13:24.353 --> 13:26.221
It appears that our Rumplestiltskin

13:26.288 --> 13:27.789
has turned over a new leaf.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.824
Apparently dozens of leaves.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.426
You sure we can trust him?

13:31.494 --> 13:33.161
Positive.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.702
The Crocodile truly has changed.

13:36.769 --> 13:39.004
He gave me a long-winded
explanation about a...

13:39.072 --> 13:40.205
portal.

13:40.273 --> 13:41.573
About how it brought the, uh...

13:41.641 --> 13:44.443
Snow Queen into this land...

13:46.078 --> 13:49.481
Which I don't recall.

13:49.548 --> 13:52.219
But the important thing is it works.

13:52.618 --> 13:54.385
All they have to do is walk through it.

13:54.764 --> 13:56.446
- Then we should go.
- Brilliant.

13:56.594 --> 13:57.634
You do that.

13:58.226 --> 13:59.363
I, alas...

13:59.998 --> 14:01.699
bruised myself during the curse.

14:02.627 --> 14:04.427
Really need to get it seen to.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.229
Hey, Killian.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.100
What's wrong?

14:10.167 --> 14:12.235
You're acting strange.

14:12.303 --> 14:15.505
Nothing.

14:15.573 --> 14:17.240
I'm fine.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.848
See you around... love.

14:42.501 --> 14:44.001
Belle?

14:46.672 --> 14:48.870
Belle?!

14:49.082 --> 14:51.016
Where have you gone?

14:51.084 --> 14:53.351
Don't tell me you've done something stupid

14:53.419 --> 14:54.820
like running away!

15:11.804 --> 15:15.340
Rumplestiltskin, I'm...
I'm supposed to ask you

15:15.408 --> 15:17.776
for... for that gauntlet from Camelot.

15:17.843 --> 15:21.079
Bring it to the base of
Demon's Bluff at midnight

15:21.147 --> 15:24.215
or... or I'll be killed.

15:27.286 --> 15:28.620
Rumple, help!

15:34.427 --> 15:36.361
You!

15:36.429 --> 15:38.296
I know where you came from!

15:38.364 --> 15:40.832
Tell your master I know who she is

15:40.850 --> 15:43.218
and she's just crossed a line!

15:52.182 --> 15:53.742
They look happy.

15:54.882 --> 15:58.551
Having Marian back in his life,
it means so much to Roland.

15:58.619 --> 16:00.620
I understand.

16:00.687 --> 16:04.390
At the end of the day,
our children come first.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.793
Regina?

16:06.860 --> 16:08.928
She's his mother.

16:08.996 --> 16:10.863
I choose you.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.438
But...

16:19.506 --> 16:21.007
But Roland.

16:22.509 --> 16:25.311
What would this look like to him?

16:25.379 --> 16:28.781
It's gonna look like a
messy, complicated situation,

16:28.849 --> 16:30.716
which it is.

16:30.784 --> 16:33.152
But if I went back to my life with Marian,

16:33.220 --> 16:35.054
I'd be living a lie.

16:35.122 --> 16:37.623
The best example I can set to my son

16:37.691 --> 16:40.593
is to live truthfully...

16:40.660 --> 16:45.197
to follow my heart... to you.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.286
Papa! Papa, help!

17:02.354 --> 17:04.021
Help, papa!

17:09.294 --> 17:10.762
I thought she was cured!

17:10.829 --> 17:13.773
There must be some remnant of
that spell still inside her.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.607
Even by now her heart should be infected.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.457
So there's no hope?

17:22.336 --> 17:23.970
There may be another way to save her.

17:24.038 --> 17:27.240
Now that the ice wall is down,
she could leave Storybrooke.

17:27.308 --> 17:30.543
She can cross the town line
and enter a world without magic.

17:30.611 --> 17:33.580
Without magic, the harm to her would end.

17:33.647 --> 17:35.381
S... s... so let's get to the town line!

17:35.449 --> 17:38.551
Robin, you need to know something.

17:38.619 --> 17:41.487
It's a one-way trip.

17:41.555 --> 17:42.755
There's a curse on the town line,

17:42.823 --> 17:45.325
and once you leave, that's it.

17:45.392 --> 17:47.894
So you're saying...

17:47.962 --> 17:49.662
I'm saying that we can't just send Marian

17:49.730 --> 17:51.130
into an unknown world.

17:51.198 --> 17:54.634
Someone has to go with her...

17:54.702 --> 17:56.636
you and Roland.

17:59.006 --> 18:01.941
And once you do go...

18:03.444 --> 18:05.812
You can never come back.

18:26.619 --> 18:28.520
I hate goodbyes. Don't you?

18:28.587 --> 18:31.456
If you've come here to gloat,

18:31.524 --> 18:33.825
I'm really not in the mood.

18:33.893 --> 18:34.893
What do you want?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.128
Belle and I are taking a trip.

18:37.196 --> 18:38.663
I came to bid you farewell.

18:38.731 --> 18:40.999
Have you been under a rock all day?

18:41.066 --> 18:42.800
There's a curse on the town line.

18:42.868 --> 18:44.836
If you leave, you can never come back.

18:44.904 --> 18:46.304
Hence the goodbye.

18:46.372 --> 18:48.740
But before I go,

18:48.807 --> 18:50.842
could you pass something on to my grandson?

18:53.279 --> 18:54.545
Tell Henry I'll miss him...

18:55.832 --> 18:59.702
And his charming attempts
at snooping around my shop.

18:59.769 --> 19:02.037
You knew.

19:02.105 --> 19:04.306
Oh, I knew.

19:04.374 --> 19:07.576
Perhaps you can tell me why.

19:07.644 --> 19:11.547
He was looking for the impossible...

19:11.615 --> 19:13.616
my happy ending.

19:15.752 --> 19:17.553
The Storybook has me written as a villain,

19:17.621 --> 19:20.356
and villains always lose, so...

19:20.423 --> 19:23.559
He thought you might have a
clue as to who the author is

19:23.627 --> 19:26.128
so I can make him change that.

19:26.196 --> 19:28.497
Intriguing idea.

19:29.699 --> 19:32.801
But, alas, I've no clue as to his identity.

19:32.869 --> 19:34.436
I know.

19:35.597 --> 19:38.332
Villains don't get happy endings.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.401
It would appear, in your
case, that that's true.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.510
You and Belle seem... content.

19:52.602 --> 19:55.337
How were you able to get one?

19:55.405 --> 19:57.172
Because I took it.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.674
And, quite frankly, you should, uh,

19:59.742 --> 20:01.743
stop moping and do the same thing.

20:01.796 --> 20:04.534
I mean, if this Marian died,

20:04.565 --> 20:06.433
all would be well, would it not?

20:08.846 --> 20:10.780
That's no longer me.

20:11.935 --> 20:15.003
Being good doesn't mean
good things will happen.

20:15.458 --> 20:19.355
This sounds like the old
Rumplestiltskin talking.

20:21.835 --> 20:24.036
I thought you changed.

20:24.104 --> 20:26.572
More like evolved.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.407
Coming back from the dead

20:28.475 --> 20:30.191
and being a slave to the wicked witch

20:30.406 --> 20:32.240
tends to do that to you.

20:32.308 --> 20:36.144
But if you don't think
villains can get happy endings,

20:36.212 --> 20:38.714
just watch me take one.

20:38.781 --> 20:40.649
There's no author of my fate,

20:40.717 --> 20:43.785
no Storybook with my destiny.

20:43.853 --> 20:46.088
I've been a villain a thousand times over,

20:46.155 --> 20:48.790
and yet I'm about to
get everything I desire.

20:53.162 --> 20:56.565
As unbelievable as it sounds,

20:57.733 --> 21:00.001
I want the same for you.

21:17.286 --> 21:19.921
Mom.

21:21.991 --> 21:24.159
The diner I told you about is
just a few miles down the road.

21:24.226 --> 21:26.094
Right.

21:26.162 --> 21:27.162
Uh, Regina...

21:27.229 --> 21:28.763
and you have the map I gave you?

21:28.831 --> 21:31.533
A... and the money, so that should
be plenty to get you started.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.568
Yes, but... good.

21:33.636 --> 21:35.937
Then you should go.

21:36.005 --> 21:38.673
Thank you.

21:43.078 --> 21:45.446
She needs to cross the line now.

21:45.514 --> 21:47.253
Okay, you guys, go.

21:47.253 --> 21:48.342
I'll be right behind you, I promise.

21:48.342 --> 21:51.115
- I just... I just need a moment, okay?
- Of course.

21:54.985 --> 21:56.552
Thank you.

22:08.732 --> 22:09.665
Mama!

22:14.404 --> 22:16.538
Robin?

22:16.606 --> 22:19.975
Your family is waiting. Go.

22:33.423 --> 22:34.723
I...

22:34.791 --> 22:36.525
I know.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.571
Papa!

23:44.545 --> 23:47.347
I have what you want, deary.

23:47.415 --> 23:49.583
Now show yourself.

23:49.650 --> 23:51.318
Rumple!

23:51.386 --> 23:52.419
Ow!

23:52.487 --> 23:54.421
Help!

23:54.489 --> 23:56.356
Yes, Rumplestiltskin!

23:56.424 --> 23:58.091
Do help her!

24:04.499 --> 24:05.699
Maleficent.

24:05.766 --> 24:07.601
Oh, I am impressed.

24:07.668 --> 24:09.436
Didn't think you had it in you.

24:09.504 --> 24:12.372
I'm not here for your praise.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.607
Give me the gauntlet

24:13.674 --> 24:15.575
and you can have your wench back.

24:15.643 --> 24:18.645
Seeing as how you asked so nicely...

24:22.149 --> 24:26.319
You think you can steal
from the dark one and live?

24:26.387 --> 24:28.989
Fatal mistake, deary!

24:29.056 --> 24:31.224
Any last words?

24:31.292 --> 24:34.394
I'm... not... alone.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.241
The sea witch.

24:52.396 --> 24:55.232
Such a pretty thing.

24:55.299 --> 24:58.435
Seems a shame I'll have to crack her pipes.

24:58.503 --> 25:03.373
Harm one hair on her
head, maleficent burns.

25:03.441 --> 25:06.109
And Ursula will kill your maid,

25:06.177 --> 25:07.711
and where will that leave us?

25:07.778 --> 25:09.212
Cruella!

25:09.280 --> 25:12.349
Thought I caught a whiff
of desperation and gin.

25:12.416 --> 25:15.151
I must say, I'm... I'm
surprised to see you all here.

25:15.219 --> 25:16.686
Last time we crossed,

25:16.754 --> 25:19.789
it looked like things
weren't going your way.

25:19.857 --> 25:22.125
And unless you hand back my maid,

25:22.193 --> 25:24.327
they won't be this time, either.

25:24.395 --> 25:26.510
Shall I get you a stepstool

25:26.510 --> 25:27.964
so you can look in my
eyes when you threaten me?

25:28.032 --> 25:29.766
I don't need to threaten you, deary.

25:29.834 --> 25:32.748
It took three of you to get this far,

25:32.962 --> 25:36.427
and I promise it isn't far enough.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.386
Have it your way.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.956
Ursula, darling, crush the maid's heart.

26:01.197 --> 26:03.465
That was, uh, a rather risky endeavor

26:03.533 --> 26:05.300
for an old glove, dearies.

26:05.368 --> 26:06.668
Oh, the risk was worth it.

26:06.736 --> 26:08.137
For too long we've lived in a world

26:08.204 --> 26:09.605
where the heroes always win.

26:10.358 --> 26:12.660
And the gauntlet will reveal
our enemies' weaknesses,

26:12.727 --> 26:14.428
and we will be the victors.

26:15.463 --> 26:17.264
Let her go.

26:23.672 --> 26:26.240
Why... why would you do that?

26:26.308 --> 26:28.575
I... I... I mean, with that object...

26:28.643 --> 26:30.544
they still won't be able to harm you.

26:31.980 --> 26:34.481
Why do you care about me?

26:37.285 --> 26:38.919
I don't.

26:40.189 --> 26:42.590
But if anyone's gonna crush your heart,

26:42.658 --> 26:44.959
it's gonna be me.

26:47.429 --> 26:52.500
When the stars on the hat
align with those in the sky,

26:52.568 --> 26:53.835
we shall begin.

26:53.902 --> 26:55.036
You mean I shall end.

26:55.104 --> 26:57.538
Let's not start mincing our words now.

26:57.606 --> 26:58.606
Oh, how brave.

26:58.674 --> 27:00.108
I half-expected you

27:00.175 --> 27:02.143
to crumble at the precipice of your demise.

27:02.211 --> 27:04.479
I'm not the one who's a coward.

27:04.546 --> 27:07.181
Well, then, you'll enjoy
watching this coward

27:07.249 --> 27:09.317
crush your heart.

27:25.814 --> 27:28.248
This place is amazing.

27:28.316 --> 27:30.717
Mom, I'll, uh, be right back.

27:30.785 --> 27:33.287
Hey, kid, wait.

27:33.354 --> 27:36.490
Well, Emma, I think this is it.

27:40.328 --> 27:41.995
Crocuses!

27:42.063 --> 27:43.196
Arendelle crocuses!

27:43.264 --> 27:44.765
Elsa, we're almost home.

27:44.832 --> 27:47.601
Wait, maybe I should open it.
Magic can be unpredictable.

27:48.970 --> 27:51.104
So this is it. Appears so.

27:51.172 --> 27:54.671
Thank you for taking such
good care of my sister.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.548
- It's kind of what we do.
- It's our pleasure.

27:58.917 --> 28:00.451
Now, don't you all have
a kingdom to go save?

28:00.518 --> 28:02.019
We sure do.

28:02.087 --> 28:04.054
I hope Hans isn't too
comfortable on that throne

28:04.122 --> 28:06.790
'cause I'm gonna knock him
right off the minute we get back.

28:06.858 --> 28:08.592
And the second minute we're back,

28:08.660 --> 28:10.127
maybe we could get married?

28:10.195 --> 28:12.062
Just a thought.

28:12.130 --> 28:15.799
Emma, thank you for everything.

28:15.867 --> 28:18.636
You've done so much.

28:18.703 --> 28:20.270
I could never repay you.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.442
It's time.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.546
Please, thank Hook and
Mr. Gold for us, as well.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.828
Good luck.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.333
I wish I had met this Mr. Gold.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.769
He seems super helpful. Who is he?

28:58.041 --> 28:59.637
I mean, who is he in the other world?

28:59.637 --> 29:00.668
Wait, let me guess.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.574
He was a fairy godfather, wasn't he?

29:02.642 --> 29:04.309
Well, not exactly.

29:04.377 --> 29:07.479
He was an evil sorcerer
you're lucky you never met.

29:07.547 --> 29:08.714
Rumplestiltskin.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.482
Wait, what?

29:10.550 --> 29:11.884
You know him?

29:11.951 --> 29:14.720
He explicitly said he didn't
know anything about you.

29:14.787 --> 29:16.855
Well, that's a lie.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.587
Not that I'm surprised. All he does is lie.

29:20.902 --> 29:23.604
So Gold was playing us the whole time.

29:23.672 --> 29:25.873
But why?

30:04.001 --> 30:04.776
It's time.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.253
Gold! Stop!

30:20.222 --> 30:21.289
I'm sorry. I can't.

30:21.356 --> 30:23.691
I've waited too long for this.

30:23.759 --> 30:25.593
And I'm too close.

30:29.183 --> 30:30.996
Well, maybe not everything
has went to plan.

30:31.572 --> 30:32.790
But this next part...

30:34.154 --> 30:36.489
I'm really gonna enjoy.

30:36.557 --> 30:39.058
Aah!

30:42.296 --> 30:43.763
I don't understand.

30:45.733 --> 30:46.966
Why can't I...

30:47.034 --> 30:49.635
because I commanded you not to.

30:53.407 --> 30:54.974
Drop the heart.

30:56.944 --> 30:59.479
Now release everyone.

31:07.121 --> 31:09.522
And now?

31:10.910 --> 31:14.079
Now you can take us to the town line

31:14.146 --> 31:17.348
because we need to be
alone for what comes next.

31:23.322 --> 31:27.125
Belle, what are you doing?

31:29.662 --> 31:32.597
Finally facing the truth.

31:32.665 --> 31:37.135
No, please put the dagger
down and let me explain.

31:37.203 --> 31:38.469
No!

31:38.537 --> 31:40.738
It's my turn to talk.

31:41.642 --> 31:45.045
Do you remember the first
time you saved my life?

31:45.112 --> 31:48.214
You traded for me.

31:48.282 --> 31:52.118
I thought I... I saw something
in you, something good.

31:53.291 --> 31:57.861
Well, I found that gauntlet today.

31:57.929 --> 32:02.032
And that's when I... I finally realized

32:02.100 --> 32:06.236
that all the signs I'd
been seeing were correct.

32:06.304 --> 32:10.841
You'd never give up power for me, Rumple.

32:10.908 --> 32:12.843
You never have.

32:12.910 --> 32:14.311
You never will.

32:14.379 --> 32:15.512
Y... y... you don't understand.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.781
No.

32:18.609 --> 32:22.178
You told me that gauntlet

32:22.246 --> 32:25.414
could lead you to... to someone's weakness,

32:25.482 --> 32:28.618
to the thing they loved the most.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.953
Well, you know where it led me, Rumple?

32:32.539 --> 32:34.874
To the real dagger.

32:34.942 --> 32:39.712
Your true love is your power.

32:39.780 --> 32:40.883
I like the power.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.527
But there's nothing wrong with power,

32:43.682 --> 32:46.250
not when it means that... that I...

32:46.318 --> 32:49.120
That we... that we can have it all.

32:51.123 --> 32:53.658
I just wanted you.

32:53.726 --> 32:57.095
I wanted to be chosen, not...

32:57.162 --> 33:01.566
I tried to be everything for you, Rumple.

33:01.633 --> 33:03.701
But I wasn't.

33:03.769 --> 33:06.704
And I... I lost my way

33:06.772 --> 33:09.273
trying to help you find yourself.

33:09.341 --> 33:11.008
Not anymore.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.978
Please, Belle. I... I...
I'll make it up to you.

33:14.046 --> 33:17.388
I... I... I've changed once
before. I can do it again.

33:19.139 --> 33:21.474
You've never changed.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.009
Please.

33:23.077 --> 33:24.043
No!

33:24.111 --> 33:27.180
It's too late.

33:29.016 --> 33:33.219
Once I... I saw the man behind the beast.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.856
Now there's only a beast.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.463
Rumplestiltskin,

33:43.530 --> 33:45.898
I command you...

33:45.966 --> 33:48.301
To leave Storybrooke.

33:48.368 --> 33:50.336
Belle, no. Please.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.772
I won't be able to come back.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.107
I know.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.543
I... I... I don't want to lose you.

33:58.611 --> 34:01.146
You already have.

34:01.214 --> 34:03.682
Belle, please.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.350
I'm afraid.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.085
Belle!

34:14.726 --> 34:16.027
Belle!

34:21.199 --> 34:23.335
No!

34:23.402 --> 34:25.770
Belle!

34:28.940 --> 34:30.876
Belle, please!

34:45.210 --> 34:47.011
Isn't it beautiful?

34:47.078 --> 34:50.581
I found it hidden in the east wing.

34:50.649 --> 34:51.581
What?

34:51.650 --> 34:52.850
Is it my hair?

34:53.554 --> 34:55.355
You're right. I should
have worn the braids.

34:55.422 --> 34:59.860
Anna, you look absolutely perfect.

34:59.928 --> 35:03.930
I wouldn't say perfect.

35:03.998 --> 35:05.832
Did you see these bruises?

35:05.900 --> 35:08.268
- Have you seen Hans' eye?
- Yeah.

35:08.336 --> 35:09.870
Totally worth it.

35:09.937 --> 35:11.271
Okay.

35:11.339 --> 35:14.174
Let's get this wedding on the road.

35:15.086 --> 35:18.555
I mean "on the aisle."

35:19.673 --> 35:21.907
Anna, why did you do it?

35:21.975 --> 35:24.076
Why did you postpone your whole wedding

35:24.144 --> 35:25.333
just to find out the truth?

35:27.638 --> 35:29.072
Elsa

35:29.140 --> 35:31.174
You're my sister.

35:31.242 --> 35:32.609
I couldn't walk down this aisle

35:32.677 --> 35:34.144
unless you were as happy as I was.

35:34.211 --> 35:39.149
Anna, I'm... Very happy.

35:43.554 --> 35:46.890
What is that amazing smell?

35:49.193 --> 35:51.161
Chocolate! Chocolate!

35:59.316 --> 36:00.884
You ready?

36:00.951 --> 36:02.986
Ready.

36:25.309 --> 36:27.610
Just be gent... ohh!

36:27.678 --> 36:29.233
Sorry.

36:29.233 --> 36:31.339
I just thought if I did it quickly,
it'd be like ripping off a...

36:40.664 --> 36:43.233
I told you, swan.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.201
I'm a survivor.

36:53.197 --> 36:55.615
I'm not in the mood
for a hope speech, Emma.

36:55.615 --> 36:57.216
You're mistaking me for my mother.

36:57.284 --> 36:58.784
Besides, you don't need a speech.

36:58.852 --> 37:00.352
You need a drinking buddy. Shots?

37:02.589 --> 37:04.323
Sure. Why not?

37:04.391 --> 37:05.824
Two.

37:09.818 --> 37:11.652
You know you did the right thing today.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.787
There it is... a hope speech.

37:13.855 --> 37:15.089
I thought we were drinking.

37:15.156 --> 37:16.724
It's not a speech. It's a compliment.

37:16.791 --> 37:18.392
Well, I don't need your validation.

37:18.460 --> 37:19.860
I know I did the right thing.

37:19.928 --> 37:23.197
I know because I'm miserable... again.

37:23.265 --> 37:25.232
Thanks.

37:26.181 --> 37:30.618
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, so is Gold.

37:30.685 --> 37:32.786
It does.

37:34.389 --> 37:36.290
Whoa, kid. Slow down.

37:36.358 --> 37:39.393
Mom! Mom! I found something big!

37:39.461 --> 37:41.495
You're gonna want to see this.

37:42.964 --> 37:45.733
After you guys left, I
stayed behind to look around,

37:45.800 --> 37:48.135
and I found something.

38:09.157 --> 38:10.491
A library!

38:10.558 --> 38:13.549
Not just any library. Look.

38:18.384 --> 38:19.751
That looks like your book.

38:19.818 --> 38:21.452
Only it's blank.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.888
They all are.

38:26.859 --> 38:30.228
And if this place is full
of potential Storybooks...

38:30.296 --> 38:34.065
then maybe this is the author's house.

38:34.133 --> 38:38.836
Henry, you did it!

38:38.904 --> 38:40.304
Did what? What's going on?

38:41.807 --> 38:45.443
Well, uh, we were looking for the author.

38:47.212 --> 38:51.849
I was hoping he could
write me a happier story.

38:51.917 --> 38:55.420
We called that "Operation Mongoose."

38:55.487 --> 38:57.789
I like it. It's got style.

38:57.856 --> 38:59.190
I'm in.

38:59.258 --> 39:01.392
You are?

39:02.451 --> 39:04.385
I made you a promise I intend to keep.

39:04.453 --> 39:06.420
Everyone deserves their happy ending.

39:11.352 --> 39:12.790
_

39:37.233 --> 39:39.067
There may come a day

39:39.135 --> 39:42.570
when the students surpass the master.

39:42.638 --> 39:45.473
But today is not that day.

39:45.541 --> 39:47.742
I want my gauntlet.

39:47.810 --> 39:49.644
We made a deal, Rumple,

39:49.712 --> 39:51.579
and you never go back on a deal.

39:51.647 --> 39:52.847
No.

39:52.915 --> 39:55.884
I paid a ransom. Quite different.

39:55.951 --> 40:00.455
Demanding a ransom from
the dark one is not a deal.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.756
It's a death wish...

40:01.824 --> 40:05.226
And a fool's errand.

40:05.294 --> 40:09.030
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have work to do.

40:09.098 --> 40:11.399
Whatever you're up to, it'll never work.

40:11.467 --> 40:14.269
The game is rigged.

40:14.336 --> 40:16.070
The villains never win.

40:16.138 --> 40:18.439
Why don't you join us?

40:18.507 --> 40:20.274
Perhaps we can change the game together.

40:20.342 --> 40:23.478
You severely underestimate me, deary.

40:23.545 --> 40:26.447
I always win.

40:26.515 --> 40:28.383
And I win alone.

40:28.450 --> 40:32.286
I certainly don't need to join
you, uh, queens of darkness.

40:43.046 --> 40:43.672
It's all I got.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.822
If you're not happy about
it, try eating each other.

40:48.094 --> 40:51.927
I hear cannibalism is frowned
upon in the aquatic world.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.024
Or maybe you could tell me differently.

40:56.113 --> 40:59.415
So, this is what a man
who always wins looks like.

40:59.483 --> 41:02.685
I assure you, Ursula, my
situation is only temporary.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.320
Really?

41:04.388 --> 41:06.756
How you gonna fix that, play the lotto?

41:06.823 --> 41:08.958
I'd like to tell you a story.

41:09.026 --> 41:11.427
It's about heroes and villains,

41:11.495 --> 41:14.063
where the villains always lose.

41:14.131 --> 41:16.565
Seems like someone's changed his tune.

41:16.633 --> 41:19.535
I've learned the rules do apply to me,

41:19.603 --> 41:22.671
but also there's someone
who can change those rules.

41:22.739 --> 41:23.773
Who?

41:23.840 --> 41:26.442
For now, let's call him "The Author."

41:26.510 --> 41:28.744
Pretentious. I hate him already.

41:28.812 --> 41:30.212
Then let's go see him.

41:31.512 --> 41:32.979
Tell him what we think.

41:33.715 --> 41:36.920
Unless you prefer life
as a fish-food dispenser.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.364
But if you're coming to me for help,

41:38.364 --> 41:39.798
I can assume it won't be easy.

41:39.866 --> 41:41.834
Who's standing in our way?

41:44.904 --> 41:47.372
The usual people... the heroes.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.191
Let's get your things.

41:50.276 --> 41:52.572
We've two more stops to make.
