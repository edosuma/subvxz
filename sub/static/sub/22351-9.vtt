00:01.990 --> 00:04.990
>> Announcer: Previously on "big
brother" ...

00:04.990 --> 00:09.990
The flirt mance of Shelli and
Clay was ruling the house.

00:09.990 --> 00:12.120
>> Being hoh has its perks.

00:12.120 --> 00:18.990
>> Despite everyone wanting
Audrey out the couple decided to

00:18.990 --> 00:20.990
target a personal threat
instead.

00:20.990 --> 00:23.410
>> Da' hasn't given me any
reason to trust her in this game

00:23.410 --> 00:25.990
and she's the one I want to see
go home this week.

00:25.990 --> 00:29.990
>> Shelli wanted to make Liz a
pawn against mama da'.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.990
>> I'm thinking about putting
yes, I do up in place of John.

00:33.990 --> 00:39.290
>> But Austin and Vanessa didn't
didn't want their Ally in

00:39.290 --> 00:41.990
harm's way trust is hard to
find.

00:41.990 --> 00:45.990
>> Announcer: So they worked to
deep Liz off the block.

00:45.990 --> 00:47.990
And their plan was successful.

00:47.990 --> 00:52.830
>> Meg if you could please sit
up there next to Da'vonne.

00:52.830 --> 00:55.410
>> Da'vonne started to expect
she was seeing double.

00:55.410 --> 00:57.000
>> She is a twin.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.990
The one last night is the
friendly one.

00:59.990 --> 01:04.990
>> And rumors quickly spread
that Liz may have a twin.

01:04.990 --> 01:11.990
>> She is --
>> at the live eviction, da' had

01:11.990 --> 01:12.990
a very bad day.

01:12.990 --> 01:18.990
>> By a vote of 7-2, Da'vonne,
you are evicted from the "big

01:18.990 --> 01:20.990
brother" house.

01:20.990 --> 01:27.990
>> At the head of household
competition, allies Austin and

01:27.990 --> 01:29.990
Vanessa went into power.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.990
Tonight which four houseguests
will be nominated for eviction.

01:33.990 --> 01:37.990
Plus will the twin twist blow up
Liz and Julia's game?

01:37.990 --> 01:40.120
Find out right now on "big
brother"!

01:40.120 --> 01:47.990
>> She's just trying to survive
until her sister comes in.

01:47.990 --> 01:53.990
Captioning funded by CBS
>> is there any information

02:30.990 --> 02:34.990
besides parties and no
have-nots?

02:34.990 --> 02:35.990
That's it.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.990
>> Being head of household feels
phenomenal.

02:39.990 --> 02:40.990
With great power comes Judas.

02:40.990 --> 02:46.990
Audrey is a big target but Judas
has some other plans.

02:46.990 --> 02:50.990
>> You're now playing, what kind
of parties are there?

02:50.990 --> 02:54.990
>> Kegs I bet pet.

02:54.990 --> 02:58.990
>> Vanessa and Austin are the
new hostledz.

02:58.990 --> 03:01.990
Vanessa, I don't know where she
stands because there's bad blood

03:01.990 --> 03:02.990
between me and her.

03:02.990 --> 03:06.830
If I was on her radar, I
wouldn't surprise me.

03:06.830 --> 03:08.990
>> I can't believe this is
happening.

03:08.990 --> 03:12.290
I can't believe this is
happening!

03:12.290 --> 03:16.990
>> In this real life not only am
I head of household right now

03:16.990 --> 03:20.990
alongside Austin, my closest
Ally in the house but in the

03:20.990 --> 03:47.990
last 24 hours I have uncovered
amazingly powerful information.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.990
>> I'm freaking out.

03:49.990 --> 03:52.120
>> It's mind boggling.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.410
>> And game changing.

03:54.410 --> 03:56.990
And really exciting.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.990
I'm freaking out.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.990
>> My name Vanessa.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.990
>> No.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.700
My name is Julia.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.990
>> I trust Vanessa.

04:10.990 --> 04:16.410
She is the only person besides
da' to tell me that people have

04:16.410 --> 04:20.990
been talking that I'm a twin and
hopefully she's willing to work

04:20.990 --> 04:25.990
with my sister and I.

04:44.990 --> 04:50.990
>> It feels great to finally
reveal my true name in the

04:50.990 --> 04:51.000
house.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.410
The huge 1-800-is lifted off of
my chest and I'm not living this

04:56.410 --> 05:01.990
huge lie anymore.

05:01.990 --> 05:09.290
>> Come in:
>> Now that I know that Liz is

05:09.290 --> 05:13.990
really Liz and Julia I know
immediately that we have to pull

05:13.990 --> 05:17.990
some other people in in order to
protect Liz.

05:17.990 --> 05:19.540
Shelli is the person to do that.

05:19.540 --> 05:25.540
They worked with me to keep Liz
off the block.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.540
Shelli and Clay.

05:33.950 --> 05:39.990
>> The two people in the house.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.990
She is the skinnier one.

05:41.990 --> 05:48.990
And the other one is the goofy
one.

05:48.990 --> 05:50.540
>> What is her name.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.990
>> Julia.

05:51.990 --> 05:53.700
>> Julia and Liz?

05:53.700 --> 05:56.990
I can't wait to talk to Julia.

05:56.990 --> 06:01.950
>> To get help they have to
survive five weeks.

06:01.950 --> 06:02.990
And that's a number for us.

06:02.990 --> 06:03.990
And that's good.

06:03.990 --> 06:09.290
>> So Vanessa and Clay and I are
thinking that's one more number

06:09.290 --> 06:14.990
to be on our side so I really
want to be a part of this.

06:14.990 --> 06:16.830
>> So I'm Shelli.

06:16.830 --> 06:17.990
It's nice to meet you.

06:17.990 --> 06:20.990
>> It's so weird!

06:20.990 --> 06:21.990
>> Ok.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.990
I'm Julia.

06:23.990 --> 06:26.000
I've been dying to tell you.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.290
>> Which one of you is zeta.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.990
>> Both of us.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.410
>> This is so cool.

06:34.410 --> 06:38.000
>> Is it the filthy vicks or
fifth week.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.830
>> Five evictions.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.410
I don't know how long people are
just going to tiptoe around and

06:43.410 --> 06:47.120
not say something to Liz.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.990
>> 100 percent we will do
whatever we can to keep you

06:49.990 --> 06:50.700
here.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.990
>> But it's going to be hard.

06:51.990 --> 06:59.830
>> So never be alone with Jason
or James or Audrey.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.990
>> Slowly but surely start
spending time with me because I

07:03.990 --> 07:04.410
totally love y'all.

07:04.410 --> 07:05.990
>> I'm so excited.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.990
Now I get to know Liz and Julia
and I get to help them

07:09.990 --> 07:13.120
throughout game. Plus we're
sorority sisters.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.990
Zeta love -- this just got so
much more fun.

07:16.990 --> 07:24.990
>> I can't wait to see Liz!

07:24.990 --> 07:26.990
>> The twin thing?

07:26.990 --> 07:29.990
>> Twin?

07:29.990 --> 07:32.990
>> What?

07:32.990 --> 07:35.290
>> What?

07:35.290 --> 07:37.700
>> She has a twin.

07:37.700 --> 07:38.990
>> Is it true?

07:38.990 --> 07:40.000
Did she tell you that.

07:40.000 --> 07:48.700
>> 100%.

07:48.700 --> 08:00.410
>> I'm an idiot.

08:00.410 --> 08:01.990
>> Oil and gas.

08:01.990 --> 08:05.990
I can't imagine.

08:05.990 --> 08:09.990
>> Liz and I, we kind of have a
good connection.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.990
I felt it disappear here and
there and now it all makes

08:13.990 --> 08:13.990
sense.

08:13.990 --> 08:14.990
>> I feel so bad.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.120
>> I don't know what is going on
anymore.

08:17.120 --> 08:25.700
I just wish I was a little bit
better detective.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.990
>> I don't know anything going
on in this house.

08:28.990 --> 08:30.120
Because I don't pay attention.

08:30.120 --> 08:36.540
>> I don't know in all Austin
thinks about is working out and

08:36.540 --> 08:38.990
bench press but he is completely
clueless.

08:38.990 --> 08:41.990
>> You may need to start paying
attention to some details.

08:41.990 --> 08:46.000
>> I think she's a lot different
now that I think about it.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.990
>> It's going to be hard to keep
her her five evictions but we

08:49.990 --> 08:49.990
have to do that.

08:49.990 --> 08:54.990
>> The plan for myself Shelli
and Clay is to include Liz and

08:54.990 --> 08:58.700
her twin as a possible 6-person
alliance down the road.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.540
It took the whole twin twist to
bring us together and I think

09:01.540 --> 09:05.290
we're all on the same page.

09:05.290 --> 09:08.990
>> We will be good.

09:08.990 --> 09:09.990
>> Now what happens?

09:09.990 --> 09:13.700
>> Now what?

09:13.700 --> 09:18.700
>> Honestly winning hoh is the
best thing that could happen for

09:18.700 --> 09:19.990
Liz and I.

09:19.990 --> 09:26.410
I am ecstatic and I feel finally
relieved and safe and we can

09:26.410 --> 09:29.990
finally secure our position in
this house.

09:29.990 --> 09:37.990
>> You're going to get to see!

09:37.990 --> 09:41.990
>> I think it's going to be an
easy week to be head of

09:41.990 --> 09:44.990
household because everyone has
the same agenda.

09:44.990 --> 09:45.990
Audrey needs to go.

09:45.990 --> 09:51.990
I say no more pawning, meaning
no more Meg being the pawn.

09:51.990 --> 09:56.990
>> Out of all of the best case
in the worst-case scenario I

09:56.990 --> 10:00.540
have no idea with Austin in
power.

10:00.540 --> 10:03.000
I have never spoken a second of
game to either of them so I

10:03.000 --> 10:10.990
could really be an easy person
for either of them to put up.

10:10.990 --> 10:16.410
>> Who do you think Austin would
put up?

10:16.410 --> 10:18.990
>> Because he's hoh.

10:18.990 --> 10:19.950
>> Vanessa?

10:19.950 --> 10:22.540
>> There's two of them.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.120
>> Oh, my God!

10:24.120 --> 10:25.990
>> He doesn't even know.

10:25.990 --> 10:26.990
>> Wake up.

10:26.990 --> 10:30.950
>> I thought you were --
>> I got knocked out.

10:30.950 --> 10:31.990
>> Will you serious?

10:31.990 --> 10:33.990
>> There's two hoh's, buddy.

10:33.990 --> 10:45.990
>> I don't know.

10:45.990 --> 10:46.990
>> Tonight.

10:46.990 --> 10:53.990
I mentioned to Liz she needs to
talk to your guys.

10:53.990 --> 10:56.990
>> At least I feel safe.

10:56.990 --> 11:03.120
>> Yeah.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.990
>> So God, so God.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.990
We don't need to talk right now.

11:07.990 --> 11:08.990
We have got all week.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.990
>> I need to talk to you.

11:10.990 --> 11:12.990
>> I know.

11:12.990 --> 11:16.990
>> I knew something was
different because I have like

11:16.990 --> 11:20.990
different connections with,
like, both of you for sure.

11:20.990 --> 11:24.990
>> This won't affect my personal
relationship with Liz at all.

11:24.990 --> 11:29.540
In fact I'm trying to help her
out now even more that I know

11:29.540 --> 11:37.990
this because people will think
they will want to -- she double

11:37.990 --> 11:45.990
crossed them.

11:45.990 --> 11:46.990
>> It's crazy.

11:46.990 --> 11:47.990
>> Awe stipulate.

11:47.990 --> 11:52.990
>> He obviously has to put pawns
up if he's truly going after

11:52.990 --> 11:52.990
Audrey.

11:52.990 --> 11:55.990
>> Last week's plan did not go
through.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.990
We were supposed to back door
Audrey.

11:57.990 --> 11:58.950
She is still here.

11:58.950 --> 12:02.990
Now with the two hoh's maybe
they could execute this plan and

12:02.990 --> 12:04.990
get rid of her once and for all.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.830
>> I know it's not going to be
Liz.

12:07.830 --> 12:12.990
I know it's not going to be
Vanessa because she's hoh.

12:12.990 --> 12:15.990
So it's got to be one of us,
man.

12:15.990 --> 12:18.990
>> I really don't talk game with
Vanessa.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.540
She's a Jack-of-all-trades.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.990
I feel like she's been trying to
get a feel out for all of the

12:24.990 --> 12:28.990
house players and the
houseguests and I don't know

12:28.990 --> 12:36.990
what is going on and I'm kind of
shaking in my boots.

12:36.990 --> 12:41.990
>> Wait, wait!

12:41.990 --> 12:46.990
This is going to give us a
90 percent chance to be in the

12:46.990 --> 12:51.120
top six.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.990
>> You do the math.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.290
>> Just tell me what to do
>>

13:05.990 --> 13:11.990
>> if Audrey is the first one to
walk out of the door, guess who

13:11.990 --> 13:13.990
is next?

13:13.990 --> 13:13.990
Me.

13:13.990 --> 13:17.990
And I can't allow that to
happen.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.290
>> Jeff?

13:20.290 --> 13:22.990
>> Jeff is a huge threat in the
house.

13:22.990 --> 13:23.990
His social game is incredible.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.990
I think he's a salesperson.

13:25.990 --> 13:28.990
I think he could probably sell
ice to an eskimo.

13:28.990 --> 13:32.990
The house may begunking after
Audrey but at the end of the day

13:32.990 --> 13:35.990
Austin and I need to do what is
best for our house.

13:35.990 --> 13:40.990
>> I can't stand -- he is the
one person in the whole house I

13:40.990 --> 13:42.990
don't like.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.990
I might just put James up.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.990
>> Being hoh with Vanessa is
amazing.

14:07.990 --> 14:08.990
We're on the same page.

14:08.990 --> 14:10.990
And now we just need our plans
to Dom to fruition.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.990
>> Who wants to see our hoh
room?

14:28.990 --> 14:31.990
Everyone upstairs!

14:31.990 --> 14:42.830
>> Yay!

14:42.830 --> 14:46.990
>> Walking in and seeing
pictures of my girlfriend and my

14:46.990 --> 14:48.990
dog, it was everything that I
needed.

14:48.990 --> 14:51.990
>> There are baby pictures of
me.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.990
>> Hold on, Austin!

14:53.990 --> 14:58.990
My dad and my brother.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.990
Look at my dad.

15:00.990 --> 15:03.990
>> Oh, wow.

15:03.990 --> 15:07.990
>>
>> Austin, my God, he is a man

15:07.990 --> 15:08.990
of many tastes.

15:08.990 --> 15:12.540
There's not many things that I
will put past him.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.990
>> Clay aiken en.

15:13.990 --> 15:17.990
>> Being a Clay aiken fan is one
of those things.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.990
It's been a decade of decadence.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.990
>> I love Clay aiken en.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.990
He is my favorite artist.

15:25.990 --> 15:28.990
His music just touches something
deep inside of me and I can't

15:28.990 --> 15:30.990
describe it but I like him.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.990
>> Clay aiken, dude?

15:32.990 --> 15:39.990
That is perfect!

15:39.990 --> 15:42.990
>> Come on, go, go.

15:42.990 --> 15:44.990
>> We will start.

15:44.990 --> 15:45.990
Did you tell anyone?

15:45.990 --> 15:48.540
>> You're going to die.

15:48.540 --> 15:53.990
Austin, Vanessa, Shelli and
Clay.

15:53.990 --> 15:58.830
>> Shelli, I literally love her.

15:58.830 --> 16:01.990
>> You're putting on the wrong
one.

16:01.990 --> 16:03.990
We need to listen to Vanessa.

16:03.990 --> 16:05.990
She is so intelligent.

16:05.990 --> 16:12.990
You need to lose waiting and I
need to gain 1-800-

16:12.990 --> 16:13.990
because I'm skinnier.

16:13.990 --> 16:14.990
>> Doesn't everyone know no.

16:14.990 --> 16:15.990
>> No.

16:15.990 --> 16:18.950
Vanessa and Austin will tell you
everything.

16:18.950 --> 16:20.830
>> You probably ate before you
came here.

16:20.830 --> 16:41.990
Go to the hoh room, just stay
away from Jason, James and Jeff.

16:41.990 --> 16:44.290
>> No way!

16:44.290 --> 16:46.990
I can tell, I can tell.

16:46.990 --> 16:55.990
>> Did your sister tell you.

16:55.990 --> 16:56.990
>> You won hoh.

16:56.990 --> 17:00.990
>> You don't even know the heart
attacks that have gone on.

17:00.990 --> 17:06.990
>> Get back in the house and my
two besties are hoh's and I am

17:06.990 --> 17:07.990
on cloud 10.

17:07.990 --> 17:10.950
My sister and I are safe for
another week.

17:10.950 --> 17:14.990
We were trying to fool the whole
house, but we are rolling with

17:14.990 --> 17:21.990
the punches:
>> Gummy bears!

17:21.990 --> 17:24.990
>> Isn't it exciting?

17:24.990 --> 17:31.990
>> Yes!

17:31.990 --> 17:34.700
>> You have a group.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.540
>> You have our word
100 percent, you know that?

17:38.540 --> 17:39.990
>> You're fine.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.990
>> Your sister should have given
her word.

17:42.990 --> 17:44.990
>> We're helping you out.

17:44.990 --> 17:47.990
>> I'm dying that you guys are
hoh.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.990
I can breathe, finally.

17:49.990 --> 17:52.950
>> But this is damage control
week.

17:52.950 --> 17:52.990
>> I know.

17:52.990 --> 17:58.990
>> They all said that your
sister is skinny, she has

17:58.990 --> 17:59.990
skinnier arms.

17:59.990 --> 18:02.830
That's super reason to get
called out.

18:02.830 --> 18:05.990
So no more gummy bears.

18:05.990 --> 18:06.990
Not even joking.

18:06.990 --> 18:11.830
>> Now that I know Liz is really
Liz and Julia it's our job to

18:11.830 --> 18:15.990
make sure that the rest of the
house believes Liz is one

18:15.990 --> 18:16.700
person.

18:16.700 --> 18:19.990
This could give us a huge
advantage.

18:19.990 --> 18:27.990
>> Hello, hello.

18:27.990 --> 18:28.990
>> I'm Liz.

18:28.990 --> 18:34.990
>> Hey, girl.

18:34.990 --> 18:38.990
>> You're a life saver, like
seriously.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.990
I'm so happy that I have you
guys.

18:40.990 --> 18:45.990
>> Obviously.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.990
>> I notice a difference in your
voice.

18:48.990 --> 18:53.990
>> I notice everything now.

18:53.990 --> 18:57.990
>> She has a fake tooth.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.990
>> It was totally awesome.

18:59.990 --> 19:04.990
We're going to end up having a
two for one deal once Liz and

19:04.990 --> 19:05.990
Julia are both in the game.

19:05.990 --> 19:09.540
We're putting our game in the
line to bring them into the

19:09.540 --> 19:09.990
house.

19:09.990 --> 19:18.990
>> This could be called with
Clay and your sister, the 6th

19:18.990 --> 19:18.990
sense.

19:18.990 --> 19:19.990
Isn't that good?

19:19.990 --> 19:22.990
>> That's really good.

19:22.990 --> 19:23.990
The 6th sense.

19:41.830 --> 19:42.290
>> Hammock action.

19:42.290 --> 19:47.990
>> I always get thrown off by
how much this hammock moves when

19:47.990 --> 19:49.990
I sit on it.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.410
Like it has way more give than
you think it should.

19:52.410 --> 20:03.990
>> We have one back home and I
sit in it every chance I get.

20:03.990 --> 20:04.990
>> No!

20:04.990 --> 20:14.990
>> Something is --
>> whoever goes up it's going to

20:14.990 --> 20:16.990
be one of us, like us.

20:16.990 --> 20:20.990
>> I think it's going to be ok
this week.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.990
>> Is one or two.

20:22.990 --> 20:22.990
>> One.

20:22.990 --> 20:23.990
>> You think?

20:23.990 --> 20:24.990
>> I swear.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.830
But I'm going to play along
because it's so much fun.

20:28.830 --> 20:32.990
>> If you look at Liz right now
up close --

20:32.990 --> 20:37.990
>> it was one of the first days
that we were here and we were at

20:37.990 --> 20:42.990
the kitchen table, ok, and it
looked like she had a crown on

20:42.990 --> 20:46.990
number nine here, and I'm like
how did you get that crown, and

20:46.990 --> 20:48.990
she was like what crown?

20:48.990 --> 20:49.990
And I was like that crown.

20:49.990 --> 20:54.990
And she is like, I never had a
crown there, and I was like, ok.

20:54.990 --> 20:57.120
>> I didn't know if she was
personal about it or something.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.990
>> It's like detective.

20:58.990 --> 21:02.990
>> When that one smiles you can
see it's a slightly different

21:02.990 --> 21:03.990
shade than the rest of them.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.990
>> We need to get an X-ray.

21:05.990 --> 21:09.990
>> Your satisfy saying maybe
there's only one Liz?

21:09.990 --> 21:10.990
>> No.

21:10.990 --> 21:14.950
I'm saying there's two.

21:14.950 --> 21:18.990
>> If this one right now, if I
can get a closer look and see if

21:18.990 --> 21:21.120
that one -- if there's nothing
wrong with that one.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.000
That's not something you can
switch in and out.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.410
>> Let's go talk to her.

21:25.410 --> 21:31.990
>> He is like, Liz, 100% has a
crown on her number nine tooth,

21:31.990 --> 21:32.990
wherever that is located.

21:32.990 --> 21:36.990
Let's see if Liz will have that
same crown.

21:36.990 --> 21:46.540
Johnny mack is a genius.

21:46.540 --> 21:51.990
>>
>> I was thinking like, let's

21:51.990 --> 21:56.410
pretend we have a camera, take
some pictures and get excited

21:56.410 --> 22:00.990
and I started clicking around
over to Vanessa and back at Liz

22:00.990 --> 22:03.990
and I'm like, Liz, smile for me.

22:03.990 --> 22:08.990
>> Get ready for a photo shoot,
smile.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.120
>> And she is not having it.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.990
I'm like, Liz you're bad at this
game.

22:14.990 --> 22:17.990
>> Or you're really good at it.

22:17.990 --> 22:18.990
>> I'm on to you.

22:18.990 --> 22:20.990
>> What do you mean you're on to
me.

22:20.990 --> 22:22.990
>> You're acting weird.

22:22.990 --> 22:24.990
>> Why am I acting weird.

22:24.990 --> 22:27.990
>> You know you're acting weird.

22:27.990 --> 22:33.990
>> You're mcshade.

22:33.990 --> 22:38.290
>> I couldn't get close enough
to tell for sure but right now

22:38.290 --> 22:42.990
my gut is telling me something
so up because they look really

22:42.990 --> 22:45.990
different for me.

22:45.990 --> 22:51.990
>>
>> I just wanted to say, like,

22:51.990 --> 22:54.990
you and Liz are like this,
right?

22:54.990 --> 22:56.000
>> We're pretty close.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.410
>> There's like conspiracy
theory.

22:59.410 --> 22:59.990
>> About Liz.

22:59.990 --> 23:00.990
>> About Liz.

23:00.990 --> 23:06.990
>> Austin is a super cool guy,
but the most important thing is,

23:06.990 --> 23:08.990
Austin is hoh this week.

23:08.990 --> 23:12.990
Why not give him a little tidbit
of information that no one else

23:12.990 --> 23:14.990
has the guts to inform him
about.

23:14.990 --> 23:15.990
>> Something crazy?

23:15.990 --> 23:20.830
>> Very crazy, like twisted type
crazy.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.990
Have you ever noticed that
sometimes Liz likes to work out

23:24.990 --> 23:27.830
with you and sometimes Liz
doesn't work out ever?

23:27.830 --> 23:27.990
>> Yes.

23:27.990 --> 23:33.990
>> Do you think it's possible
Liz has an identical twin?

23:33.990 --> 23:35.990
>> No, dude.

23:35.990 --> 23:36.990
I'm dead serious.

23:36.990 --> 23:41.990
>> Jeff, thanks for the info my
man but I know what is going on

23:41.990 --> 23:44.410
and I might know a little bit
more than you do.

23:44.410 --> 23:47.990
>> We could use this to our
advantage though.

23:47.990 --> 23:48.950
>> We can.

23:48.950 --> 23:53.290
>> I'm not a detective --
>> this makes a lot of sense.

23:53.290 --> 23:56.990
>> I think one has a crush on
you and one doesn't.

23:56.990 --> 23:57.990
>> That's what I felt.

23:57.990 --> 24:02.120
>> Like the one that doesn't has
a crush on me is weird.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.700
We started looking for marks.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.700
Johnny just went up there to
look at her teeth.

24:09.700 --> 24:14.990
He said one has a crown on
number nine and he wanted to see

24:14.990 --> 24:16.700
if this one does.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.990
Doesn't say anything until we
can prove it or disprove it.

24:19.990 --> 24:23.990
>> If Jeff is going to keep
pressing this Liz and Julia

24:23.990 --> 24:25.990
thing I have to protect her at
all cost.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.990
It's making him a bigger target
in my mind.

24:28.990 --> 24:34.990
>> I will continue to help you
out but you help me over and

24:34.990 --> 24:37.410
keep this information from Liz.

24:37.410 --> 24:46.990
>> She will come clean one way
or the other.

24:46.990 --> 24:49.990
>> What do you think we should
do and I will tell you.

24:49.990 --> 24:55.990
>> I think somehow we should
still try to back door James or

24:55.990 --> 24:55.990
Jeff.

24:55.990 --> 24:56.990
>> Back door them.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.540
>> Front door them?

24:59.540 --> 25:00.990
>> Ok.

25:00.990 --> 25:02.990
>> I think we leave --
>> you put them up?

25:02.990 --> 25:07.990
>> I think we put one of them
with someone who is going to

25:07.990 --> 25:14.990
throw it on my side, and get the
other one off the block and put

25:14.990 --> 25:19.990
two punish people on the other
side who are good at

25:19.990 --> 25:20.000
competition.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.990
>> Who can I put up.

25:21.990 --> 25:24.990
>> Meg has to go up on your
side.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.990
>> And Johnny mack.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.990
>> Johnny has been up every
time.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.990
>> What do I offer him in
return?

25:30.990 --> 25:33.990
>> Protection, maybe two weeks
into jury or something.

25:33.990 --> 25:37.990
>> Something like that.

25:37.990 --> 25:41.000
>> He is never winning.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.830
>> True.

25:44.830 --> 26:01.990
>>
>> you're the only person that

26:01.990 --> 26:02.990
can do it.

26:02.990 --> 26:03.990
Here is the offer.

26:03.990 --> 26:06.990
If you're willing to throw it --
>> for her.

26:06.990 --> 26:13.990
>> For me, Austin and I will get
you through one week in jury, no

26:13.990 --> 26:18.290
nomination, no back door, no
vote for eviction.

26:18.290 --> 26:18.990
No pawn ever.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.950
>> Here I go again.

26:20.950 --> 26:23.700
I'm becoming the block veteran
so let's go.

26:23.700 --> 26:27.120
>> So you're completely safe
until there's 10 people.

26:27.120 --> 26:27.990
Are you ok with that.

26:27.990 --> 26:31.990
>> Wu have to do what we have to
do.

26:31.990 --> 26:35.290
>> The whole house is asking you
to do something and by asking,

26:35.290 --> 26:37.290
telling you to do something, you
just do it.

27:16.990 --> 27:19.990
>> This is the nomination
ceremony.

27:19.990 --> 27:26.990
It is our responsibility, as the
hostledz to nominate two

27:26.990 --> 27:28.990
houseguests for eviction.

27:28.990 --> 27:31.990
I will reveal my nominations
first.

27:31.990 --> 27:47.990
First houseguest that I have
nominated is --

27:47.990 --> 27:57.990
the next houseguest that I have
nominated is --

27:57.990 --> 28:02.990
>> I have nominated you Meg and
you Jason for eviction.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.990
Meg, you were called out last
week by Da'vonne.

28:05.990 --> 28:07.990
I want you to prove yourself.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.990
Jason I want you to do your best
as well today.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.990
These were difficulty decisions
for me today but there's a

28:13.990 --> 28:18.990
bigger design to this I hope you
guys can understand.

28:18.990 --> 28:31.700
>> The first houseguest that I
have nominated is ...

28:31.700 --> 28:33.990
>> Look at that guy.

28:33.990 --> 28:48.990
>> The second houseguest that I
have nominated is ...

28:48.990 --> 28:50.700
>> James I have nominated you.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.990
I want to acknowledge the
tremendous maturity you

28:52.990 --> 28:56.830
displayed in a lot of tough
situations during your reign as

28:56.830 --> 28:57.990
head of
head of householdal head of

28:57.990 --> 29:00.990
household so I know you will
respect this as the game move

29:00.990 --> 29:01.990
that it is.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.540
John, I have nominated you very
similarly and I want you to do

29:05.540 --> 29:08.990
what you do best which is go out
there, crush the competition,

29:08.990 --> 29:10.990
score yourself off the block.

29:10.990 --> 29:14.990
I wish both of you gentleman the
best of luck from the bottom of

29:14.990 --> 29:15.990
my heart.

29:15.990 --> 29:22.990
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

29:22.990 --> 29:27.990
>> Austin nominates me and puts
me up with princess pretty pawn.

29:27.990 --> 29:29.990
I'm not feeling safe at all.

29:29.990 --> 29:34.120
I am pissed.

29:34.120 --> 29:42.990
>> I'm ticked off to be
nominated for the third time.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.990
I wasn't in the first spot.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.990
Why would anyone take that away
from me?

29:47.990 --> 29:48.950
That's rude.

29:48.950 --> 29:54.990
>> Being nominated next to
Johnny mack is a tough spot.

29:54.990 --> 29:57.990
It's a bad situation all the way
around.

29:57.990 --> 30:02.290
>> I'm technically still on the
outs of the house right now.

30:02.290 --> 30:06.990
And I hope that they don't back
door me.

30:06.990 --> 30:11.990
However, "Big Brother," and you
never know what is going to

30:11.990 --> 30:17.410
happen --
>> I think they're going to

30:17.410 --> 30:19.990
stick to the plan.

30:19.990 --> 30:21.120
>> I'm sorry.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.830
>> Are you all right, Clay?

30:24.830 --> 30:25.990
>> Just relax.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.990
>> I'm so pissed.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.990
>> Meg, please, do not worry.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.990
>> I'm not.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.830
>> You know you're good.

30:33.830 --> 30:35.410
>> Honestly, I know.

30:35.410 --> 30:39.540
I would rather be there than
back doors with the recent

30:39.540 --> 30:42.990
pawning and I'm not doing that
this whole game.

30:42.990 --> 30:43.990
>> Please do not worry.

30:43.990 --> 30:45.000
>> You will be fine, Meg.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.410
Ok?

30:49.410 --> 30:51.990
>> Jason, I never got to give
you a hug.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.990
>> That's ok.

30:54.990 --> 30:56.990
>> Let's go here.

30:56.990 --> 31:00.990
>> I really wanted to talk to
you when we had a chance.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.830
Here is my idea.

31:03.830 --> 31:03.990
Audrey.

31:03.990 --> 31:06.000
And this is my big fear.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.990
What if Audrey gets úhe veto and
I had to talk to Vanessa first

31:09.990 --> 31:13.990
and I don't want to are ruffle
her feathers because she's on

31:13.990 --> 31:15.540
board with getting Audrey out.

31:15.540 --> 31:19.990
>> I have to convince the house
Audrey is the back door plan.

31:19.990 --> 31:21.990
They cannot know Vanessa and I
have other plans.

31:21.990 --> 31:24.540
>> So I'm hoping you guys win.

31:24.540 --> 31:27.990
>> You have to understand with
this pairing it does not look

31:27.990 --> 31:28.990
that way.

31:28.990 --> 31:33.410
Me and Meg, the two most
feminine weak lings in here

31:33.410 --> 31:37.000
against two capable men and it
looks like Vanessa is

31:37.000 --> 31:39.990
purposefully trying to be
dethrown asked you're trying to

31:39.990 --> 31:40.990
lead us up there.

31:40.990 --> 31:42.990
>> Some of the competitions
Jason and I might win.

31:42.990 --> 31:44.990
Putting on a play.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.990
We dazzling a backpack.

31:47.990 --> 31:48.990
Cooking a tritt at that time a.

31:48.990 --> 31:52.000
I have not seen one of those on
"Big Brother."

31:52.000 --> 31:52.990
This is going to be great.

31:52.990 --> 31:57.120
>> Look, I'm going to do
whatever I can to stop one of

31:57.120 --> 31:58.700
your guys from going home.

31:58.700 --> 31:59.990
>> I hope so.

31:59.990 --> 32:02.990
>> I know it doesn't mean much
coming from me after I nominated

32:02.990 --> 32:05.000
you but that's all I can tell
you.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.990
>> I don't trust Austin for
nothing.

32:07.990 --> 32:14.990
I don't trust nobody that has a
damn penis, especially Austin.

32:14.990 --> 32:17.990
>> Sorry, buddy.

32:17.990 --> 32:18.990
>> We got this.

32:18.990 --> 32:21.990
>> Johnny mack has been
nominated three times since he

32:21.990 --> 32:22.990
has been here.

32:22.990 --> 32:24.990
He is obviously a competition
beast.

32:24.990 --> 32:25.990
He is still here.

32:25.990 --> 32:28.990
We just got to pull out this
win.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.410
>> I feel like you and me will
be a good team.

32:31.410 --> 32:35.000
We just have to pull ourselves
off and we're good for the rest

32:35.000 --> 32:35.990
of the week.

32:35.990 --> 32:40.990
>> Yeah I'm good but you don't
know what kind of good I am.

32:40.990 --> 32:44.120
I'm going to do what I have been
doing all along and make sure

32:44.120 --> 32:48.990
that we completely screw this
thing up.

32:48.990 --> 32:49.990
>> Let's do it.

32:49.990 --> 32:51.990
>> I got you back, man.

32:51.990 --> 32:54.990
>> All right.

33:05.990 --> 33:09.990
>> Hey, everyone, time for the
battle of the bulge competition.

33:09.990 --> 33:12.990
Everyone head to the back yard
because there's no place like

33:12.990 --> 33:17.990
foam glsmght.

33:17.990 --> 33:20.290
>> There's no place like foam!

33:20.290 --> 33:24.990
>> It's a foam party!

33:24.990 --> 33:30.000
>> So I walk outside and I see
this crazy foam party and I'm

33:30.000 --> 33:33.990
like, yes, this is just a
regular Tuesday in Miami.

33:33.990 --> 33:40.990
>> Welcome to the amazing foam
party.

33:40.990 --> 33:46.990
The nominees will battle the
other nominees.

33:46.990 --> 33:51.540
The winning pair wins safety for
the week and will dethrone the

33:51.540 --> 33:52.990
hoh that nominated them.

33:52.990 --> 33:57.000
This party is so off the chain
that everyone is losing their

33:57.000 --> 33:59.990
minds and their personal
belongings.

33:59.990 --> 34:05.950
Your job is to find one item in
the lost and found and return to

34:05.950 --> 34:08.290
the party-goers wearing the
matching partner.

34:08.290 --> 34:12.410
Once you return the matching
item, lead them out of the foam

34:12.410 --> 34:13.990
and into your vip area.

34:13.990 --> 34:16.990
Then it's your teammates turn to
do the same.

34:16.990 --> 34:20.990
The first person with 10 people
in their v.I.P. Party area wins

34:20.990 --> 34:24.990
the battle of the block.

34:24.990 --> 34:27.000
>> And here is the catch.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.290
Hidden in the foam is a maze.

34:31.290 --> 34:33.290
So getting there won't be easy.

34:33.290 --> 34:39.990
Who is ready to play gronts'
amazing foam party.

34:39.990 --> 34:45.410
>> I really want to win this
battle of the block but I can't

34:45.410 --> 34:47.990
make it too obvious.

34:47.990 --> 34:50.990
If people see I'm throwing
things it could be my head in

34:50.990 --> 34:50.990
this game.

34:50.990 --> 34:55.540
>> I'm not just hungry to win
the battle of the block, I'm

34:55.540 --> 34:56.990
starving for it.

34:56.990 --> 35:00.990
Austin tells me oh, I'm not a
target but who knows what

35:00.990 --> 35:02.410
Austin's plan really is?

35:02.410 --> 35:05.990
>> I don't know what Austin and
Vanessa stand at.

35:05.990 --> 35:09.990
That's why it is imperative that
I win this battle of the block.

35:09.990 --> 35:14.990
It's time for me to dive my
Southern boy butt into that foam

35:14.990 --> 35:15.990
and save my behind.

35:15.990 --> 35:22.990
>> Open your mark, get set, go!

35:22.990 --> 35:26.990
>> The object of the game is
match the patterns in the lost

35:26.990 --> 35:30.990
and found with the pattern on
the partiers in the maze.

35:30.990 --> 35:35.990
I could be looking for a bag,
tank top, and I see a hat and I

35:35.990 --> 35:40.540
head into the maze and it's like
going into a closet, tut cutting

35:40.540 --> 35:43.290
the light out and trying to find
stuff.

35:43.290 --> 35:47.830
>> So I see this hot brunette
who has the same bathing suit

35:47.830 --> 35:49.990
pattern as the hat.

35:49.990 --> 35:52.990
Gives me the yes and I'm like,
bingo.

35:52.990 --> 35:53.990
It's time to go.

35:53.990 --> 36:02.700
I escort her out of the maze and
into the v.I.P.Section.

36:02.700 --> 36:06.000
>> This is so disorienting.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.990
I can't see where I'm going and
I can't breathe.

36:10.990 --> 36:11.290
>> Jason lost.

36:11.290 --> 36:13.990
>> He is lost in that foam.

36:13.990 --> 36:15.990
>> Come on, Jason?

36:15.990 --> 36:18.990
>> I run straight into a wall.

36:18.990 --> 36:22.700
I have done my fair share of
partying and I have never hit a

36:22.700 --> 36:27.990
wall this early in the night.

36:27.990 --> 36:32.990
>> Jason made it out.

36:32.990 --> 36:38.120
>> Each team has one partier.

36:38.120 --> 36:38.990
Oh, my God.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.540
>> That foam is crazy.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.990
You go into it and you're like
oh, bubbles.

36:44.990 --> 36:47.990
I love bubble baths, so this
will be easy.

36:47.990 --> 36:51.290
Then you start reading it's like
being under water.

36:51.290 --> 36:53.990
You can't breathe while you're
covered in it.

36:53.990 --> 36:55.000
>> She's doing it.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.990
>> Johnny mack is moving pretty
slow.

36:58.990 --> 37:01.410
He is choking on the foam.

37:01.410 --> 37:05.990
It looks to me like he is doing
exactly what he promised me he

37:05.990 --> 37:07.990
would do and that is throw it.

37:07.990 --> 37:09.410
>> All right, Johnny.

37:09.410 --> 37:12.700
>> So I'm searching through the
foam and running through the

37:12.700 --> 37:17.290
maze and I find the girl with
the same blue pattern.

37:17.290 --> 37:23.990
I show her the purse and she
says yeah it's mine and I'm like

37:23.990 --> 37:25.990
lady do you want to go to the
v.I.P. Area?

37:25.990 --> 37:27.950
Hell yeah, let's go.

37:27.950 --> 37:36.950
I'm starting to see I have to
put the brakes on this because

37:36.950 --> 37:38.000
we're going to destroy them.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.990
>> I'm running left and right,
swiping off foam from all of

37:42.990 --> 37:47.990
these partier's bodies and
seeing what patterns I can find.

37:47.990 --> 37:52.990
The moment I realize that the
plaid shorts are wrong I run

37:52.990 --> 37:58.990
back to the lost and found area
and I try again.

37:58.990 --> 38:01.120
>>
>> I hate shopping.

38:01.120 --> 38:05.120
>> The only patterns I know are
cammo.

38:05.120 --> 38:10.990
>> I recognize this palm tree
pattern that I saw in the maze

38:10.990 --> 38:14.290
with the guy with the murse.

38:14.290 --> 38:17.990
How can you forget the man with
the murse.

38:17.990 --> 38:22.990
I find the boy with the murse
and it's a match and we're good

38:22.990 --> 38:23.990
to go.

38:23.990 --> 38:27.990
>> The game is tied up, 2-2.

38:27.990 --> 38:31.990
>> Let's go hottie hot.

38:31.990 --> 38:38.990
>>
>> ok, Jason, let's work on it.

38:38.990 --> 38:41.410
Work on it.

38:41.410 --> 38:45.990
>> If this competition was about
duck grass or saw grass I would

38:45.990 --> 38:46.990
have been on top.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.990
But I look around and I see
paisley print and stripes and

38:50.990 --> 38:58.830
chevrons and I'm like a deer in
headlights right now.

38:58.830 --> 39:00.990
>> Scarf, scarf, scarf.

39:00.990 --> 39:05.990
>> Me and Meg definitely are
communicating well in this

39:05.990 --> 39:06.410
challenge.

39:06.410 --> 39:07.990
>> Go, Jason.

39:07.990 --> 39:08.990
You go boy hunting.

39:08.990 --> 39:10.990
>> This is yours.

39:10.990 --> 39:11.000
Come on.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.990
>> This is nothing for me.

39:12.990 --> 39:15.990
I'm used to pulling boys in the
club.

39:15.990 --> 39:25.540
>> This club is made for a guy
man and New York looking for

39:25.540 --> 39:25.990
chics.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.990
>> See the guy in the hot?

39:27.990 --> 39:28.830
Green and yellow?

39:28.830 --> 39:29.990
>> No.

39:29.990 --> 39:29.990
No.

39:29.990 --> 39:32.990
>> Are you trying to throw this
thing?

39:32.990 --> 39:34.990
Because we can't be that obvious
about it, man.

39:34.990 --> 39:36.990
>> It may be pink.

39:36.990 --> 39:36.990
I don't know.

39:36.990 --> 39:41.990
>> I love fishing but I do not
like fishing for clothes.

39:41.990 --> 39:44.990
>> Yes, yes!

39:44.990 --> 39:47.990
>> Is this yours?

39:47.990 --> 39:53.990
>> I'm going up to these girls
and I've only got six noes.

39:53.990 --> 39:57.000
I have never been told no by so
many girls in my entire life.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.990
>> Is this yours?

39:58.990 --> 40:02.990
>> Once again I get in a
situation where my partner's

40:02.990 --> 40:05.990
lack of skill is just throwing
this competition for me.

40:05.990 --> 40:10.990
I just get to sit there and
watch.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.990
>> There you go, there you go!

40:12.990 --> 40:15.990
>> Hey, baby cake.

40:15.990 --> 40:17.990
Oh, yeah.

40:17.990 --> 40:17.990
>> Oh, baby.

40:17.990 --> 40:22.830
>> Me and Meg are crushing this
competition.

40:22.830 --> 40:25.540
My v.I.P. Area keeps filling up
with these cute boys.

40:25.540 --> 40:28.990
>> I have a cheetah, the
brunette, a cutie.

40:28.990 --> 40:34.990
>> We look like we are at gold's
gym.

40:34.990 --> 40:36.540
Come on.

40:36.540 --> 40:44.990
>> You are seeing Jason, they're
mad killers and I'm like do it

40:44.990 --> 40:45.120
for me.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.000
I don't have to do anything.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.990
>> Just give me that and bring
back boys and it's all good.

40:51.990 --> 40:54.990
>> Meg and Jason just need one
more partier.

40:54.990 --> 40:57.120
>> Sorry, bro.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.830
>> One more.

40:58.830 --> 40:58.990
>> You got this.

40:58.990 --> 41:05.990
>> I have to find a striped
pattern purse to match the

41:05.990 --> 41:12.990
brunette in the back bikini.

41:12.990 --> 41:15.000
>> Is that it?

41:15.000 --> 41:25.990
>> Oh, my God!

41:25.990 --> 41:28.290
>> Ahh!

41:28.290 --> 41:33.990
>> Meg and Jason, you have won
the battle of the block and you

41:33.990 --> 41:35.990
are now safe this week!

41:35.990 --> 41:38.990
>> It feels amazing!

41:38.990 --> 41:43.990
Amazing to win the battle of the
block.

41:43.990 --> 41:47.990
I proved to this boys that I'm
here to stay.

41:47.990 --> 41:51.950
>> I get to exhale and stay head
of household.

41:51.950 --> 41:53.990
I get to control what is going
to happen this week.

41:53.990 --> 41:57.990
Of course I risk getting blood
on my hands but overall I think

41:57.990 --> 41:59.990
it's a good spot to be in.

41:59.990 --> 42:00.990
>> Thank God.

42:00.990 --> 42:05.990
>> Unfortunately Austin, you are
no longer head of household.

42:05.990 --> 42:09.990
You have lost your throne.

42:09.990 --> 42:12.990
But enjoy this foam!

42:12.990 --> 42:13.990
Ahh!

42:13.990 --> 42:17.990
>> Oh, my gosh!

42:17.990 --> 42:23.990
>> Once again, Johnny mack laid
down in the center of the ring

42:23.990 --> 42:27.120
and took the rip for the seam.

42:27.120 --> 42:31.120
All that's left is to execute
the man that Vanessa and I have

42:31.120 --> 42:31.990
created.

42:31.990 --> 42:35.830
>> So I may have lost the battle
of the block but I'm hoping

42:35.830 --> 42:36.990
Audrey is still the target.
