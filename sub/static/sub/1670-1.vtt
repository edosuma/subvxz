02:00.480 --> 02:01.639
<i>Ten...</i>

02:01.640 --> 02:05.199
<i>nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

02:05.200 --> 02:09.279
<i>five, four, three, two...</i>

02:09.280 --> 02:10.547
<i>one.</i>

03:54.920 --> 03:56.585
Dr. Serizawa?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.159
Jerry Boyd. I'm warning
you, it's a mess.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.759
It's just a total mess.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.479
Monarch sent me in this morning.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.226
Took a look around, but I
told them we needed you.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.999
They picked up a radiation
pocket out here last month.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.799
They got excited, thinking
they had a uranium deposit.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.679
They started stacking up the
heavy machinery and then...

04:15.680 --> 04:17.220
Well, the valley floor...

04:17.519 --> 04:20.584
collapsed into a cavern below.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.781
Just dropped away. Just gone.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.381
Best guess right now is about
40 miners went down with it.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.306
This way.

04:42.320 --> 04:46.625
When they first discovered this pocket, the
radiation levels were only half as strong.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.039
It's almost as if contact
with the outside air...

04:50.040 --> 04:53.310
started catalyzing something.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.587
Some kind of fossils, right?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.981
I've been digging holes for 30 years,
I've never seen anything like it.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.504
Oh, my God. Is it possible?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.671
Is it him?

05:21.200 --> 05:22.239
No.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.429
This is much older.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.390
Hey, guys. You gotta see this.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.781
What is it?

05:55.600 --> 05:57.470
Some kind of egg?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.784
A dormant spore?

06:03.240 --> 06:06.066
The bones are fossilized...

06:06.720 --> 06:10.149
but this formation seems
to be perfectly preserved.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.629
This one looks broken.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.839
It's like something...

06:14.840 --> 06:16.346
came out of it.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.262
I'll get it. It's probably for me.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.079
No, Takashi.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.439
No. Takashi, just listen
to me for a second.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.079
I'm asking for the meeting because if
I have to shut the reactor down...

07:24.080 --> 07:26.860
you're not gonna want to
read about it in a memo.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.239
I've been following these tremors since
they started in the Philippines...

07:31.240 --> 07:33.622
and now they're in
our own backyard.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.399
No, no, no. Hayato says...

07:35.400 --> 07:38.431
I need to go through
you about this.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.799
Look, I'm just...

07:39.800 --> 07:44.105
trying to follow the protocols set forth
by the company. That's all. It's my job.

07:44.680 --> 07:45.981
He's awake.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.879
Oh, I know. He got up early.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.039
What are we gonna do?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.144
Get dressed. I'll figure it out.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.901
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.479
Later, Dad.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.759
With all due respect,
Takashi, and honor...

08:01.760 --> 08:04.399
respect and honor,
with all of that...

08:04.400 --> 08:07.759
I'm an engineer. I don't like
unexplained frequency patterning...

08:07.760 --> 08:12.110
near a plant where I'm responsible.
I need a meeting. Make it happen.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.399
Bye, Mom!

08:21.120 --> 08:22.959
He made you a sign.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.706
- What?
- Your birthday sign.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.743
- He worked so hard.
- Oh, God.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.879
I'm gonna come home early.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.799
I'll take the car
and pick him up...

08:33.799 --> 08:36.068
and we can get a proper cake. Okay?

08:36.840 --> 08:39.279
Listen, I need to know...

08:39.280 --> 08:41.879
that it's not the sensors. Okay?

08:41.880 --> 08:45.399
I can't be calling this meeting and
look like the American maniac.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.679
So when we get there...

08:46.680 --> 08:50.679
don't even bother coming up. Just
grab a team and go down to Level 5.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.999
You're not a maniac.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.399
I mean, you are,
just not about this.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.742
Must be something we're
not thinking of.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.870
Happy birthday.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.759
What? Is it...?

09:03.760 --> 09:06.279
- Yes, it is. Ha, ha.
- Oh, I forgot all about it.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.025
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.999
I should have a birthday
more often. Ha, ha.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.359
<i>- What is this?
- Seismic anomaly.</i>

09:27.360 --> 09:29.662
This graph is minutes.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.519
X is minutes, not days.
This is now.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.119
Wait, hold on. Seismic activity?

09:35.120 --> 09:37.479
Seismic? You're talking
about earthquakes?

09:37.480 --> 09:40.119
No, earthquakes are random, jagged.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.185
This is consistent, increasing.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.359
This is a pattern.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.830
All right. Let's make this quick.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.719
Takashi. What the hell is
going on? Have you seen this?

10:05.720 --> 10:07.279
Yeah. Maybe not such...

10:07.280 --> 10:09.105
good time for a meeting.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.864
What's the source?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.079
Where's the epicenter?

10:15.080 --> 10:18.599
We don't know. But it
keeps getting stronger.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.948
It's gotta be centered somewhere.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.461
Hayato.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.305
No one else is reporting it.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.799
We are contacting every other
plant in the Kantō region.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.519
Tōkai, Fujiyama.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.799
They're unaffected.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.105
But my guess is these readings are just
aftershocks from the Philippine earthquake.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.279
Are we at full function?

10:37.280 --> 10:38.547
Yes, we are.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.302
But perhaps we should be
drawing down, to be safe.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.301
Take us offline.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.599
- Now, Joe...
- Do it!

10:49.600 --> 10:51.199
Now. Wind it down.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.439
Sandra.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.946
Sandra, are you there?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.759
We're turning back.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.902
Let's go.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.064
Oh, my God.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.919
Joe, are you there?

11:12.920 --> 11:16.799
<i>Joe, there's been a breach. We're
heading back to the containment seal.</i>

11:16.800 --> 11:18.919
Listen. You need to
get out of there.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.279
<i>If there's been a reactor breach,
you won't last five minutes...</i>

11:21.280 --> 11:22.679
<i>with or without the suits.</i>

11:22.680 --> 11:23.719
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

11:23.720 --> 11:25.510
I hear you. We're coming!

11:32.640 --> 11:34.305
I'll meet them there myself.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.639
Put the safety doors
on manual override.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.879
I cannot do that!

11:37.880 --> 11:40.342
Keep the doors open.
My wife is still in there!

11:46.160 --> 11:47.159
Come on...

11:47.160 --> 11:48.063
let's go!

11:59.200 --> 12:00.519
Tell me this door's...

12:00.520 --> 12:01.359
on manual.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.519
<i>Yeah. But we are
starting to breach!</i>

12:03.520 --> 12:05.948
I'm here. Soon as they're
through, I'll seal it.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.159
Sandra, can you...

12:07.160 --> 12:09.269
hear me? I'm at the door.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.423
Sandra?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.239
Sandra, I'm waiting for you.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.919
<i>I'm at the checkpoint.</i>

12:14.920 --> 12:16.999
<i>But you have to run
as fast as you can.</i>

12:17.000 --> 12:17.903
I am!

12:23.120 --> 12:24.479
Kenji. Kenji...

12:24.480 --> 12:26.020
we need to go!

12:27.480 --> 12:28.679
<i>Joe!</i>

12:31.280 --> 12:32.479
<i>Close the door!</i>

12:32.480 --> 12:34.987
<i>Seal the corridor or the
whole city will be exposed.</i>

12:39.640 --> 12:41.021
Sandra?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.667
<i>- Joe? Joe, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

12:45.880 --> 12:49.423
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Sandra, I'm here. Can you hear me?

12:49.720 --> 12:51.101
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:51.480 --> 12:54.439
<i>Joe, it's too late.
We're not coming.</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:56.519
No, don't say that!
Don't you say that!

12:56.520 --> 12:58.629
Run as hard as you can, honey.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.079
<i>Joe, you have to close the door.</i>

13:02.080 --> 13:04.701
<i>You have to live for our son.</i>

13:08.120 --> 13:11.679
<i>- Joe, seal the door! Now!</i>
- Oh, my God.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.359
<i>Five seconds! Four seconds!</i>

13:40.920 --> 13:42.710
I'm sorry.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.221
Take care of Ford.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.662
Be a good father.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.639
I will.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.590
We didn't make it.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.627
Let's go out!

14:37.160 --> 14:41.351
Hurry! Come on! Ford!

15:13.280 --> 15:14.991
On your feet!

15:21.640 --> 15:23.599
You got family waiting for you?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.999
I hope so.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.479
How long you been away?

15:26.480 --> 15:28.079
Fourteen months.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.279
Take it slow.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.742
It's the one thing they
don't train you for.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.468
All right! Let's go!

15:35.880 --> 15:38.159
- I can't tell you.
- Can I see it?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.461
Don't let him see.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.199
Whoa. Oh, my God.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.799
- It's a welcome home cake.
- Look at that.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.039
That's you.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.946
- And that's me.
- What's it say?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.759
"Welcome home, Daddy."

15:50.760 --> 15:51.719
Daddy's home.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.879
- Daddy's home.
- Cake every night.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.799
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- Daddy's home equals...

15:56.800 --> 15:57.839
cake every night.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.199
How did you manage to get
chocolate on your eyeball?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.467
- Daddy did it.
- Heh.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.039
<i>I can't sleep with you...</i>

16:04.040 --> 16:05.910
- ...making all this noise.
- Hee-hee-hee.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.662
Come on, let's get you into bed.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.903
Okay, big man.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.347
Time to hit the rack.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.741
Dad?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.581
Yeah?

16:21.080 --> 16:23.621
Are you still gonna
be here tomorrow?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.021
Yeah.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.744
Come on, let's get some sleep.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.799
Turns around, nose-to-nose,
he says, "At ease, lieutenant."

16:46.160 --> 16:48.462
God, I missed your laugh.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.790
I missed you.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.780
Mmm.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.079
Mm-mm.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.759
- I should get that. No, it could be work.
- Mm-mm.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.461
- I need to get that.
- You don't need to. Come on.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.226
Hello?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.559
Yeah, this is Mrs. Brody.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.839
Tell him you're busy tending
to your husband's needs.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.665
Shh.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.503
Yeah, he's my husband.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.068
Tell them we're not gonna buy it.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.711
Yes, sir. Could you just
hold on one moment?

17:35.880 --> 17:37.386
It's the consulate.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.902
Joe's been arrested in Japan.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.829
Elle, I can't find my pants.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.065
They're in the other drawer.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.639
So why was he trespassing
in the quarantine zone?

17:52.640 --> 17:54.159
Ugh. Why do you think?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.622
The lone crusader for the truth.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.239
All his crackpot cuckoo theories.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.719
Your father is a good man. He
just needs your help right now.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.199
Ford, he's lost everything.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.199
Yeah, so did I. But you
know what? I got over it.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.229
Right. I can see that.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.983
I'm sorry. It's just...

18:20.440 --> 18:23.559
Every time I let him in close,
he always tries to drag me back.

18:23.560 --> 18:27.546
And I can't. I can't put
our family through that.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.988
Well, he is your family.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.470
Hey. Come here.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.191
You know you're only gonna be
gone for a few days, right?

18:44.600 --> 18:48.222
And then you are gonna
come back to me.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.744
Yeah. Yeah.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.679
It's not the end of the world.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.665
Papa.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.511
I don't get many visitors.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.226
Clearly.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.181
This is you here.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.839
Even, uh, Ph.D.'s...

20:16.840 --> 20:20.064
don't get much teaching
English as a second language.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.039
Here we go.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.421
And a towel.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.519
All right.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.901
So...

20:28.320 --> 20:30.239
how's the bomb business?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.747
It must be a growth
area these days.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.751
It's called "explosive
ordnance disposal."

20:36.560 --> 20:38.959
My job isn't dropping bombs.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.864
It's stopping them.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.828
- Dad.
- Hey...

20:44.520 --> 20:46.279
how's Elle doing?

20:46.280 --> 20:48.519
And Sam. Oh, my God. He must be...

20:48.520 --> 20:50.399
what? Three? Three and a half?

20:50.400 --> 20:52.190
He's almost 5.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.586
I thought you were over this.
"Echolocation"?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.399
- Oh, hey.
- "Parasitic communication..."

20:58.400 --> 21:01.919
Please don't, if you don't mind.
I have everything the way I like it.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.999
I'm just... I'm
studying bioacoustics.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.039
What were you doing,
going back there?

21:07.040 --> 21:10.159
- This trespassing stuff, that was bull.
- You broke the law.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.039
I was trying to get
back to our old house.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.865
- In a quarantine zone.
- Precisely.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.119
The new readings are exactly
like they were on that day...

21:17.120 --> 21:18.719
and I can prove it to you.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.919
With a little luck,
if I can get back...

21:20.920 --> 21:22.359
to the house...

21:22.360 --> 21:26.319
I can show you and the world this was
not from a natural disaster. This was...

21:26.320 --> 21:27.621
Dad!

21:50.880 --> 21:53.148
Your mom's out there, Ford.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.941
To me...

21:57.080 --> 21:59.109
she'll always be there.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.700
They evacuated us so quickly.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.544
I don't even have a picture of her.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.744
This has to stop.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.199
You know I did everything I could.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.581
You know that, right?

22:26.360 --> 22:28.105
Let me take you home.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.509
Come home with me.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.429
I got a little boy who's
desperate to see his grandpa.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.144
We can leave tomorrow.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.061
What are you doing?

23:20.280 --> 23:22.105
I'm heading back out there, Ford.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.439
- No. I don't think so.
- One hour, in and out.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.946
I have to go!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.519
I came back here and
wasted six years...

23:28.520 --> 23:31.279
staring through that barbed
wire, thinking it was...

23:31.280 --> 23:35.107
a military mistake or some horrible
design flaw they were covering up.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.319
One day...

23:39.320 --> 23:42.624
I met a guy who runs a
cargo boat offshore.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.919
Every day he goes right
past the reactor site.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.190
So he places a couple frequency
monitors on buoys for me.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.279
Two weeks ago...

23:52.280 --> 23:55.319
I check this thing like every
other day just for the kick.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.624
Two weeks ago, I'm tuning in...

23:59.600 --> 24:01.664
and, oh, my God...

24:02.000 --> 24:03.790
there it is.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.159
Whatever "it" is that's in there.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.191
Whatever it is they're
guarding so carefully...

24:12.280 --> 24:14.548
started talking again.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.265
And I mean talking.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.861
Ha, ha.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.719
I have to go back...

24:21.720 --> 24:22.839
to our house.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.905
I need my old disks,
if they're still there.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.759
I need the data to be able
to prove a baseline here...

24:30.760 --> 24:34.587
that this isn't a fantasy, that
I'm not what you think I am.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.225
I'm gonna find the truth...

24:37.440 --> 24:38.719
and end this.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.590
Whatever it takes.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.987
Why can't you just let it rest?

24:46.240 --> 24:48.668
Because I sent her down there, son.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.519
This wasn't just a
reactor meltdown.

24:52.520 --> 24:53.999
I don't wanna hear this.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.348
I know. I know you don't.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.789
But you can't keep running away.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.429
And, son, you can't
bury this in the past.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.744
What spooked them?

25:59.800 --> 26:02.944
Dad, come on. Let's go.
It's only another two blocks.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.581
Dad!

26:10.480 --> 26:12.020
Are we going home, or what?

26:14.280 --> 26:16.319
Whoa! Hey, what are you doing?

26:16.320 --> 26:17.781
Dad?

26:18.880 --> 26:20.466
It's clean.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.300
I knew it.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.709
The radiation in this place should
be lethal, but there's nothing.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.020
Thank God.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.382
Are they rebuilding the plant?

28:25.120 --> 28:28.359
I don't know. I haven't seen...

29:33.040 --> 29:35.866
<i>Ten seconds. Ten seconds.</i>

30:01.560 --> 30:04.079
Seven-point-two seconds
and getting stronger.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.870
We're trending exponentially.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.745
That's our new curve.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.547
Jesus, it's worse than we thought.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.951
Excuse me, Dr. Serizawa?

30:14.760 --> 30:16.839
Two men were just
arrested in the Q-zone.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.879
We've got bigger problems here.
Have Dr. Graham take a look.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.989
She did, sir. She sent me.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.587
One of them says he used
to work here, doctor.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.439
You are not fooling anybody...

30:28.440 --> 30:31.279
when you say that what
happened 15 years ago...

30:31.280 --> 30:32.719
Found these disks in his bag.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.639
...was a natural disaster.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.279
Not sure what to make of them.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.999
Not an earthquake, it wasn't
a typhoon. Okay? So stop...

30:40.000 --> 30:42.359
Look, I'm tired of talking
to you about this.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.599
I want my son.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.109
I wanna see my son. I wanna
know that he's all right.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.102
This guy, this guy knows.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.759
He knows where he is.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.829
I want my son.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.679
And I want my bag and disks.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.759
And I wanna talk to somebody in
charge, not you. No, not you.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.824
I'm done talking to you.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.559
All right? You're looking at me right
now, like I'm in a fish tank, right?

31:08.560 --> 31:10.703
Fine. Because I know
what happened here.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.719
And you keep telling
everybody that this place...

31:13.720 --> 31:15.959
is a death zone, but it's not.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.399
You're lying.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.399
Because what's really happening...

31:19.400 --> 31:22.351
is that you're hiding
something out there.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.024
I'm right, aren't I?

31:26.280 --> 31:29.629
My wife died here!

31:31.320 --> 31:34.783
Something killed my wife.

31:35.960 --> 31:36.879
And I have...

31:36.880 --> 31:38.625
a right to know!

31:39.640 --> 31:41.908
I deserve answers!

31:48.680 --> 31:50.039
All these items...

31:50.040 --> 31:51.239
they were found on him.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.679
- And the date. Look, 15 years ago.
- I thought all of the data...

31:54.680 --> 31:56.919
from that day was lost.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.187
I guess not.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.748
You see?

32:02.440 --> 32:06.028
You see? There it is again.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.839
That is not a transformer
malfunction.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.188
That is an electromagnetic pulse.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.319
It affects everything electrical...

32:14.320 --> 32:15.839
for miles and miles...

32:15.840 --> 32:17.839
and it is happening again.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.439
This is what caused everything
in the first place.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.265
Don't you see that?

32:23.200 --> 32:25.946
And it is gonna send us
back to the Stone Age.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.181
You have no idea what's coming.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.639
Pulses are seconds apart.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.841
They're getting stronger.
It's affecting the power grid.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.319
Any radiation leakage?

32:40.320 --> 32:42.119
Gamma levels are still zero.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.959
It sucked all three reactors dry.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.544
It's done feeding.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.079
What's this?

32:59.080 --> 33:01.239
- It's the same pattern.
- Fifteen years ago...

33:01.240 --> 33:04.319
- it's what caused the meltdown.
- An electromagnetic...

33:04.320 --> 33:06.999
pulse. That's what it's building to.
Converting all that radiation...

33:07.000 --> 33:08.919
until it hatches.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.949
We have to shut down.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.746
Secure the grid.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.147
Wildfire protocols.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.629
All personnel, clear the
first perimeter immediately!

33:30.680 --> 33:33.267
What's going on?
Hey, where you going?

33:53.680 --> 33:55.027
Grid's secure.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.105
Kill it.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.983
All readings are flatlined.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.791
Ahem.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.505
Get a visual.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.744
Jesus. Check the grid. Hit us with
an EMP. We're losing power!

35:37.680 --> 35:40.319
- Get the backup generators online.
- Working on it.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.919
That pulse fried every circuit.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.479
- Check the cage.
- Trying the backup generators.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.827
Here we go.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.221
Everybody out!

35:59.360 --> 36:00.239
Now!

36:31.000 --> 36:33.906
Hey! Let me out! Hey!

37:07.360 --> 37:08.719
No! No, wait!

37:08.720 --> 37:09.623
Stop!

37:16.720 --> 37:18.021
Ford!

37:35.520 --> 37:36.469
Dad!

38:33.920 --> 38:37.359
<i>It was unlike anything I've
ever experienced before.</i>

38:37.360 --> 38:39.359
Yeah, it's, uh, Ford Brody.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.519
Japan to San Francisco.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.679
Okay, could I at least... if you
could let me leave you my cell...

38:45.960 --> 38:46.959
Hello?

38:48.120 --> 38:49.626
Damn it!

38:57.680 --> 38:59.505
I'm sorry.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.062
Hey, it's okay.

39:02.120 --> 39:05.310
It's okay. Daddy's gonna be okay.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.630
Daddy's gonna be okay.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.679
<i>This area is now under
Naval military jurisdiction.</i>

39:16.680 --> 39:18.359
<i>All personnel must report...</i>

39:18.360 --> 39:20.959
<i>to the duty officer for debriefing.</i>

39:28.720 --> 39:30.670
Dr. Serizawa!

39:32.720 --> 39:34.351
Dr. Serizawa!

39:34.480 --> 39:36.279
Dr. Serizawa.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.150
Captain Russell Hampton.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.999
Glad to find you.
I've been briefed...

39:40.000 --> 39:41.999
on your work with
Operation Monarch.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.079
Now, I'm told your organization
has situational awareness...

39:45.080 --> 39:46.950
of our unidentified creature?

39:47.200 --> 39:48.626
Is that right?

39:49.160 --> 39:52.079
We are now taking over
operational authority...

39:52.080 --> 39:54.279
from Monarch. So I'm
gonna need you...

39:54.280 --> 39:55.439
to come with me.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.742
Is there any other
personnel you need?

40:02.720 --> 40:04.239
They'll take care of you.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.780
I'll be right next to you.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.501
Okay.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.941
Them.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.879
- Let's get his vitals.
- Shh. Shh.

40:32.880 --> 40:36.423
- Dad. Dad.
- Radial pulse is weak. I'm counting 125.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.625
It's okay.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.740
You were right.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.746
I'm sorry.

40:52.120 --> 40:54.184
Go home to your family.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.227
You keep them safe.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.909
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.465
Whatever it takes.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.026
Whatever it ta...

41:08.000 --> 41:09.984
Hey, stay with me.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.159
Dad?

41:11.160 --> 41:13.599
- Dad?
- Radial pulse is weaker. Barely feel it.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.639
We're losing him.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.999
- Joe, can you hear me?
- He's going into A-fib.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.519
Give me another epi, one milligram,
and 40 units of vasopressin.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.300
Stay with us. Come on, Joe.
Hang in there, buddy.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.942
This is our needle in
a haystack, people.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.559
MUTO.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.519
Massive unidentified
terrestrial organism.

41:37.520 --> 41:41.239
It is, however, no longer
terrestrial. It is airborne.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.679
The world still thinks
this was an earthquake...

41:43.680 --> 41:46.267
and it would be preferable
that that remain so.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.599
Before we lost sight, it was
headed east across the Pacific...

41:50.600 --> 41:52.799
and had emitted enough
EMP disruption...

41:52.800 --> 41:55.639
to create havoc with our
radar and satellite feeds...

41:55.640 --> 41:59.719
and reduce us, for the moment,
to a strictly visual pursuit.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.879
I emphasize "for the moment"...

42:01.880 --> 42:04.239
because we will get on our game...

42:04.240 --> 42:06.429
and we will find this thing.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.265
It is imperative that we do so.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.279
Captain, I want any...

42:12.280 --> 42:15.789
- and all search options on this table ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.350
Dr. Serizawa.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.747
Admiral William Stenz.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.439
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad to have you on board.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.901
Sensei.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.461
Excuse me.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.119
<i>- Authorities issued a statement...</i>
- Brody's dead.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.879
<i>claiming the nuclear
contamination...</i>

42:38.880 --> 42:43.151
<i>is at no risk of spreading,
even as the death toll rises.</i>

43:04.040 --> 43:05.910
Lieutenant Brody?

43:08.520 --> 43:10.424
Dr. Serizawa.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.904
My condolences.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.066
We are deeply sorry for
your loss, lieutenant.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.188
But I'm afraid we need your help.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.119
This is the USS Nautilus.

43:27.120 --> 43:28.148
In 1954...

43:28.360 --> 43:32.506
the first time a nuclear submarine
ever reached the lower depths...

43:33.200 --> 43:35.639
- it awakened something.
- The Americans...

43:35.640 --> 43:38.079
first thought that
it was the Russians.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.382
The Russians thought
that it was them.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.341
All those nuclear bomb
tests in the '50s...?

43:46.680 --> 43:47.663
Not tests.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.749
They were trying to kill it.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.421
Him.

43:54.880 --> 43:57.999
- An ancient alpha predator.
- Millions of years...

43:58.000 --> 43:59.559
older than mankind.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.919
From an age when the Earth...

44:00.920 --> 44:03.063
was 10 times more
radioactive than today.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.879
This animal and others like it...

44:06.880 --> 44:09.759
consumed this radiation
as a food source.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.319
As the levels on the surface
naturally subsided...

44:12.320 --> 44:14.827
these creatures adapted to
live deeper in the oceans.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.865
Further underground.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.860
Absorbing radiation
from the planet's core.

44:20.040 --> 44:23.439
The organization we work for,
Monarch, was established...

44:23.440 --> 44:25.504
in the wake of this discovery.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.639
A multinational coalition...

44:27.640 --> 44:29.271
formed in secrecy...

44:29.760 --> 44:30.709
to search for him.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.186
Study him.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.264
Learn everything we could.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.221
We call him...

44:38.920 --> 44:40.399
<i>Gojira.</i>

44:40.400 --> 44:41.479
The top of...

44:41.480 --> 44:43.509
a primordial ecosystem.

44:44.240 --> 44:47.669
A god, for all intents
and purposes.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.799
- A monster.
- Fifteen years ago...

44:50.800 --> 44:54.599
we found a fossil of another
giant animal in the Philippines.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.839
Like Gojira. But this creature...

44:57.840 --> 44:59.279
died long ago.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.389
Killed by these.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.225
Parasitic spores.

45:03.480 --> 45:07.159
One dormant. But the other hatched.
Catalyzed when a mining company...

45:07.160 --> 45:09.542
unknowingly drilled into its tomb.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.639
The hatchling burrowed straight for
the nearest source of radiation...

45:12.640 --> 45:15.439
your father's power
plant in Janjira...

45:15.440 --> 45:18.439
and cocooned there for 15 years,
absorbing its radioactive fuel...

45:18.440 --> 45:21.439
- to gestate, to grow.
- Until it hatched...

45:21.440 --> 45:24.079
like a butterfly into the
creature you saw today.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.159
Wait. You knew about this?

45:26.160 --> 45:29.479
This thing? The whole time?
Why didn't you...

45:29.480 --> 45:31.599
- kill it when you had the chance?
- It was absorbing...

45:31.600 --> 45:33.999
radiation from the reactors.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.359
We worried killing it...

45:35.360 --> 45:38.519
might release that radiation
and endanger millions.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.199
That's why our mission
was to contain it.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.424
To study its biology,
to understand it.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.799
We knew the creature was
having an electrical effect...

45:46.800 --> 45:49.079
on everything within
a close proximity.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.279
What we didn't know...

45:50.280 --> 45:52.879
was that it could harness
this same power...

45:52.880 --> 45:55.262
in an EMP attack.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.585
But your father did.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.639
He predicted it.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.829
What else did he say?

46:01.880 --> 46:04.399
Please try to remember, Mr. Brody.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.959
Anything that would help us.
Anything at all.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.750
I didn't listen.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.309
I just thought he was crazy.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.159
He was obsessed with all this...

46:18.160 --> 46:20.986
Said something about
an animal call.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.831
Something talking.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.501
Talking?

46:27.080 --> 46:29.189
He said he was studying something.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.225
Echolocation.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.461
If the MUTO was talking that day...

46:34.840 --> 46:38.383
your father must have discovered
something talking back.

46:39.400 --> 46:40.986
- Check again.
- Yup.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.719
Search for a response call.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.670
This parasite.

46:44.720 --> 46:48.439
It's still out there.
Where's it headed?

46:48.440 --> 46:50.279
The MUTO is young...

46:50.280 --> 46:51.581
growing.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.425
It will be looking for food.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.759
Sources of radiation.

46:56.760 --> 46:59.301
We're monitoring all known sites...

46:59.840 --> 47:01.266
but if we don't find it soon...

47:01.640 --> 47:03.271
Then what?

47:04.120 --> 47:05.945
Nature has an order.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.390
A power to restore balance.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.709
I believe he is that power.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.319
Sir, right now we're
50 miles from Hawaii.

47:19.320 --> 47:21.907
This transport will take you there.

47:22.200 --> 47:26.221
You're catching a commercial
flight back to San Francisco.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.547
I'm gonna need you
to brush your teeth.

47:41.760 --> 47:44.879
- Disgusting! Those are terrible!
- Ha, ha.

47:44.880 --> 47:46.119
We gotta brush them!

47:46.120 --> 47:48.159
<i>Citizens within a
100-mile radius...</i>

47:48.160 --> 47:50.319
<i>are being temporarily
evacuated from the area.</i>

47:51.880 --> 47:55.104
<i>Hey, this is Elle. You missed me.
Please leave a message.</i>

47:55.360 --> 47:56.866
Elle.

47:58.680 --> 48:01.959
I don't know what they're
saying on the news.

48:01.960 --> 48:04.501
There was an accident in Japan.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.991
Dad's gone.

48:08.680 --> 48:10.869
I'll explain when I see you.

48:11.280 --> 48:14.584
I'm headed to Hawaii. I'm gonna
catch a flight from there.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.670
I'll see you soon.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.585
Keep scrolling.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.861
Near the end. Before the EMP.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.628
There.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.864
Something responded.

48:50.960 --> 48:53.759
<i>Aloha, and welcome aboard.</i>

48:53.760 --> 48:56.239
<i>The train will begin
moving shortly.</i>

48:56.240 --> 48:59.783
<i>For the comfort of others,
no smoking, please. Thank you.</i>

49:03.680 --> 49:06.599
<i>Please remember to stay
clear of the automatic doors.</i>

49:06.600 --> 49:07.959
Akio!

49:07.960 --> 49:09.479
Mama!

49:09.480 --> 49:10.303
Mama!

49:11.840 --> 49:13.141
Hey, hey, hey.

49:14.000 --> 49:14.983
Mama!

49:15.640 --> 49:17.879
I can't open it. Look, don't
worry. Just wait there.

49:17.880 --> 49:18.839
I'll bring him back.

49:18.840 --> 49:19.799
Okay?

49:19.800 --> 49:21.101
- Mama!
- Hey, hey.

49:21.600 --> 49:22.319
Mama!

49:24.320 --> 49:26.399
- Whoa. Hey. Whoa, kid.
- Mama!

49:26.400 --> 49:28.589
It's okay. I'm gonna
bring him back.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.719
All right. I'm gonna
set you down there.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.119
I'll get you back to your parents.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.182
Okay?

49:34.800 --> 49:36.226
Here. Is this what you want?

49:37.280 --> 49:39.582
Take good care of him for me.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.951
I better not miss my flight, kid.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.959
Admiral, received an intel report.

49:45.960 --> 49:49.279
We lost track of a nuclear Akula 50
nautical miles northwest of Hawaii.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.866
Could be the MUTO.

49:54.760 --> 49:58.223
Just got word of a missing Russian
sub in the North Pacific.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.159
Martinez?

50:00.160 --> 50:03.239
Aye. Special Forces Team Sparta
1 is picking up a distress signal...

50:03.240 --> 50:05.519
northwest of Diamond Head
on the island of Oahu.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.559
They're on the ground,
headed to the beacon.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.719
...on 5.23 north-northeast...

50:09.720 --> 50:12.307
<i>of the last beacon.
Moving in on foot.</i>

50:26.480 --> 50:28.319
Wanna tell me why we're looking...

50:28.320 --> 50:29.999
for an Akula in the jungle?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.159
Probably a glitch.
Russians said they...

50:32.160 --> 50:33.719
got a ping from this location.

50:33.720 --> 50:36.119
Hey, I got a reading.
It's right up ahead.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.159
<i>Sparta 1, this is Hawkeye.</i>

50:41.160 --> 50:44.719
<i>We're getting the same ping off
the transponder. Range 30 meters.</i>

50:44.720 --> 50:46.624
<i>Looks like you're getting warm.</i>

50:49.640 --> 50:51.239
What the hell?

51:01.360 --> 51:03.230
Jesus.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.190
Oh, my God.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.189
Guardian 3, we located
your Russian sub.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.879
<i>You're not gonna believe
what else we found.</i>

51:25.880 --> 51:27.102
Holy shit.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.959
<i>It appears to be rising
approximately 20 to 30 meters...</i>

51:36.960 --> 51:38.239
<i>above the tree line.</i>

51:38.240 --> 51:40.039
<i>We can't tell how wide it is.</i>

51:40.040 --> 51:42.959
Cat's out of the bag, doctor.
No more secrets.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.399
Our highest priority now is safety.

51:45.400 --> 51:48.146
There's close to a million
people on that island.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.999
Get me eyes in the air.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.319
We're picking up something else.
Approaching from the Pacific.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.439
We need to check out that object.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.879
General quarters.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.879
Bridge, this is the captain.

51:59.880 --> 52:02.199
- Where you going?
- Up to the flight deck.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.799
I think he is coming.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.199
What are you doing?

52:05.200 --> 52:07.150
I have to see this.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.425
Whoa.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.541
Two Charlie Six, we are circling
the target. Go on your command.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.665
Stand by, got a visual.
Bogey at my 12.

53:20.480 --> 53:23.399
Be advised. Prepare
to engage target.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.439
We're getting movement...

53:24.440 --> 53:25.707
down here.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.748
Take cover!

53:37.880 --> 53:38.839
Control, I have...

53:38.840 --> 53:40.869
no power. I say again,
I've lost all...

53:51.800 --> 53:53.431
You all right?

53:54.320 --> 53:56.941
You give it 10 seconds,
lights gonna come back on.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.351
It's okay.

54:03.640 --> 54:06.261
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

54:12.160 --> 54:13.950
What is it?

54:21.640 --> 54:22.987
Dad!

54:23.600 --> 54:24.981
Zoe?

54:25.400 --> 54:26.781
Zoe!

54:27.720 --> 54:29.385
Oh, my God.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.159
Run. Run! Tsunami! Tsunami!

54:38.240 --> 54:40.319
<i>Target spotted offshore...</i>

54:40.320 --> 54:42.941
two knots due east of your position.
Could be a second bogey.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.239
Anybody hurt?

57:06.240 --> 57:08.759
- Anyone get an eyeball on the bogey?
- Where is he?

57:25.920 --> 57:27.159
There you go.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.666
What did I tell you?

57:35.960 --> 57:38.308
<i>... please. Thank you.</i>

57:52.200 --> 57:53.079
Get down!

58:06.160 --> 58:07.143
Let's go!

58:19.000 --> 58:20.479
<i>Remember to stay...</i>

58:20.480 --> 58:21.702
<i>clear of the doors.</i>

58:24.880 --> 58:26.591
Go, go, go!

58:37.400 --> 58:38.879
<i>Target in sight...</i>

58:38.880 --> 58:42.548
- ...two o'clock, 300 meters.
- We're on 6-X-01. Target confirmed.

58:45.520 --> 58:46.821
Jesus!

59:31.520 --> 59:34.061
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

59:34.320 --> 59:38.067
<i>...and everybody started
running and screaming.</i>

59:38.760 --> 59:41.267
Sam, please turn that TV off.

59:47.280 --> 59:49.199
Hey, did you hear me?

59:49.200 --> 59:50.581
Off.

59:55.160 --> 59:56.666
Come on, Sammy. Let's go.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.631
Let's go. It's bedtime.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.399
- Sammy.
- Mommy, look.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.509
Dinosaurs.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.919
<i>Attention, please.
Incoming patients...</i>

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.599
<i>- please proceed...</i>
- Excuse me.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.239
Hi. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.479
This boy's been separated
from his parents.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.599
Fill this out. Be with you...

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.140
in just a minute.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.999
Hey, you got service
on that cell phone?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.064
No. The pay phones don't even work.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.547
- Akio!
- Akio!

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.465
Mama! Papa!

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.624
Corporal, load up, load up.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.999
Sergeant. Lieutenant
Brody, U.S. Navy.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.639
I need your help. I'm trying
to get to the mainland.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.559
It's your lucky day. Everything
not tied down is moving east.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.988
- Whoa, is that where they're heading?
- Yeah.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.509
I guess we're monster hunters now.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.341
<i>Satellite transfer complete.</i>

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.479
Simulations uploaded.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.199
Satellite tracking continues.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.159
Last satellite tracks predict
the MUTO continuing due east.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.719
All our models have the targets
converging on the Pacific Coast.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.159
As of now, it looks like Godzilla's
still following the MUTO.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.666
He's hunting.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.799
Have all vessels maintain
current distance from target.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.279
And plot the speed and
heading of these things.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.119
I wanna know exactly when and
where they'll make landfall.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.639
Yes, sir.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.829
Doctor, what did you
mean by "hunting"?

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.639
You think it's chasing this MUTO?

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.679
But if the MUTO is his prey...

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.439
The signal shows a call.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.719
- Why call up a predator?
- No, it didn't.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.879
I think Godzilla...

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.466
was only listening.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.586
The MUTO was calling
something else.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.706
The pattern.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.239
Focus the search on Nevada.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.319
Nevada? Why would it go to Nevada?

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.239
- It can't be. It's impossible.
- What's impossible?

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.386
There was another spore, intact,
found in the Philippine mine.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.599
But we vivisected it.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.639
Ran every test on it for years.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.639
You confirmed it for yourself.
It was dormant!

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.479
Maybe not anymore.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.879
This spore. Where
is it now, doctor?

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.879
It was highly radioactive.
It was disposed of.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.519
The Americans, they took it.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.424
Doctor, where is it?

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.705
Where you put all
your nuclear waste.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.270
Go, go, go!

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.399
Right, let's go!
Give me a Mark I...

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.701
eyeball on every vault.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.423
Clear!

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.261
Clear!

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.239
Clear!

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.349
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.502
Clear!

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.302
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.341
Hey!

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.879
Is anyone in there?

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.119
<i>Captain, our UAVs have
footage of the new MUTO.</i>

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.319
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.621
Yes, sir.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.319
This is from five minutes ago.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.985
My God.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.031
Playing all we have now.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.945
It's almost 300 feet.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.144
It's far bigger than the other one.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.464
But this one doesn't
have any wings.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.425
A different sex?

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.746
A female.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.944
That's who he's been talking to.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.919
It must be a mating call.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.826
The female remained dormant
until the male matured.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.304
Now they're seeking radiation.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.145
To reproduce.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.919
Current tracking models indicate that
all three targets are converging here:

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.221
San Francisco Bay.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.709
But if we rig a nuclear warhead
with a shielded timer...

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.199
put it on a boat and send it...

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.439
20 miles out...

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.504
the radiation lures the MUTOs...

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.799
and the MUTOs lure Godzilla.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.039
And we detonate, with minimal
fallout risk to the city.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.079
You can't be serious.
They feed on radiation.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.759
Correct. That's why we
use the bomb as bait.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.119
And kill them...

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.344
- ...with the sheer force of the blast.
- This is crazy.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.599
Doctor, if you have any
other ideas, I am all ears.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.140
Admiral.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.231
Yes, doctor?

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.305
Gojira may be the answer.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.519
I believe...

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.266
he's here to restore balance.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.279
He can defeat them.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.079
And what? We just
stand by and watch?

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.304
I'm sorry, doctor.
I can't take that risk.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.999
Prep the warheads and get
them moving to the coast.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.904
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.545
I know you don't agree with this.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.628
But my first priority is
to safeguard our citizens.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.159
It's stopped.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.461
Yes.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.719
Eight-fifteen in the morning.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.149
August 6, 1945.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.425
Hiroshima.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.590
It was my father's.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.559
Heads up.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.799
We've got new
destination, new orders.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.959
Let's get geared up.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.199
Hey, tech sergeant.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.501
What's the word?

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.231
Another one of those things
popped up in Nevada, sir.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.983
Okay, everybody out.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.384
Can't fly any further.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.599
We're well in range of its EMP.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.399
So from here on out, it's on the
ground or it's not at all. Let's go!

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.879
All right, listen up!

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.519
This train and these weapons
are headed to San Francisco.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.300
Anyone not part of this
mission, disembark now!

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.479
<i>Negative.</i>

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:07.599
Can't do it, sir.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.559
This is a high-risk mission. That train
is a national asset, not Amtrak.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.118
- We good to go?
- Just about.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.158
From the look of the casings
on those Minuteman ICBMs...

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.465
guessing the digital module's been bypassed
and you're prepping for full analog retrofit.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.359
Is my jaw supposed to drop?

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:24.078
I get it. You're EOD.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.719
- I got my crew, they know what they're doing.
- Aim the pointy end...

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.590
at the monsters, right, sarge?

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.469
When was the last time you let one of your
guys put their fingers in a live bomb?

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.719
Look, this is what I do.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.385
This is my job.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:41.064
Master sergeant.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.349
My family's in the city.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.307
Okay? I need to get on that train.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.279
<i>You heard the spokesman say...</i>

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:55.663
<i>that the White House has not ruled
out the use of nuclear force.</i>

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.708
Sam, your mom's gonna
be right back.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.824
Emergency, can I help you?

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.341
Hello?

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.190
Oh, yeah, just a sec.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.919
Elle, for you.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.541
- Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
- Elle.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.425
It's your husband.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.519
Hello?

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.867
Elle?

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.026
<i>Ford?</i>

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.519
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.599
<i>- You all right? How's Sam?</i>
- I've been calling you everywhere.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.879
- You okay?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.319
- I've got Sam with me.
<i>- Great. Because I wanna get you both...</i>

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.065
Can't believe this is happening.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.239
<i>Ford.</i>

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.905
<i>You okay? Are you doing okay?</i>

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.479
<i>I'm okay. Elle, please don't worry.</i>

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.679
Baby, I'm so scared right now.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.708
<i>I know.</i>

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.901
I'm gonna be at the
hospital by sunrise.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.110
Then I'll get you and Sam out.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.759
Okay.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.188
<i>The military has a plan to
deal with these things.</i>

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.279
<i>I'm coming to get you both, okay?</i>

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.866
Okay.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.239
Can you please just hurry?

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.599
<i>I will.</i>

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.583
<i>Elle?</i>

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.867
I just wanted you to
know that I love you.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.903
I love you too. Just be safe.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.506
I'll see you soon.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.943
Good to go! Let's move out!

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.839
<i>As blackouts and
electrical interference...</i>

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.599
<i>radiate farther and farther west...</i>

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.439
<i>citizens within 200 miles of the
creature's current sphere of influence...</i>

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.719
<i>are being urged to
please find shelter...</i>

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.279
<i>stay indoors and
stay off the roads.</i>

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.309
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.879
<i>...kids in the car.</i>

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.519
<i>...debris going back
about two miles.</i>

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.983
<i>This girl is not breathing.</i>

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.271
<i>...people that are hurt.
Send somebody out here now!</i>

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.061
Yes, sir.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.547
Yes, warheads are on the move.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.704
I completely agree, sir.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.319
All right, people. Let's go.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.199
I need to know the exact
location of the MUTOs ASAP.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.679
Aye. We're updating our models with
the current tracking data now.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.106
Admiral.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.861
Yes?

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.350
Please don't do this.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.468
I understand your concerns, doctor.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.319
But I am sacrificing lives...

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.959
every minute trying to steer one of these
things clear of population centers...

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.864
and now there are two
more on the way.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.759
There are millions of lives at risk.
So all I want to know...

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.999
from you is:

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.667
Will it work and can
they be killed?

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.039
But we tried that before.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.919
We're talking dialable yield.
Megatons, not kilotons.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.759
Nothing can withstand that blast.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.462
Makes the bomb we tried to kill it
with in '54 look like a firecracker.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.199
- Sergeant Morales. Give me a hand.
- I thought these nukes...

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.119
- all detonated by remote control.
- The MUTOs knock out...

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.479
everything electric.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.319
Including detonators.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.305
Can't even get in range without
these things going haywire.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.639
But this?

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.279
This, on the other
hand, is old-school.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.679
Clockwork.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.919
Takes a licking...

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.460
- keeps on ticking.
- Heh.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.279
Holy shit.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.221
Sergeant Morales, get down here with
that radio. On the double. Move, move!

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.599
Snake Eyes, this is Bravo to
November. Is the bridge...

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.919
clear? Over.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.159
I say again:

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.079
We got a train of VIP cargo...

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.111
headed for the coast. Is
the bridge clear? Over.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.439
Snake Eyes, I need a sitrep.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.079
Are the tracks clear?

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.239
We are at phase line yellow. In the next 10
mikes, we're advancing to phase line red.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.959
Secure or not? Over.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.425
You think it's intact?

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.959
Only one way to find out.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.719
- You wanna take the top?
- Sure.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.546
You check below. Sergeant
Morales, you come with me.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.828
Shit.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.425
Jesus.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.466
- Jones, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good!

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.919
The bridge is intact.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.359
Bulldog, this is Eagle.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.999
All clear to move out. Over.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.825
<i>Roger that, Eagle.</i>

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.663
Let's go! Let's go, people!

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.159
Say again.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.384
I do not have a visual.
What is your position? Over.

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.307
Unreadable. Say again. Over.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.031
Hit the deck.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.959
Help me turn it off, man.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:00.903
Run!

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.079
Move it, run!

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.226
Ford! Aah!

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.679
<i>He's going under!</i>

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.999
Boats, sound the collision alarm.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.711
Frame 180.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.544
We're losing visual, admiral.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.226
He's diving.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.479
Changing course and moving fast. I've got
him at 33 knots and picking up speed.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.191
He's gonna outrun us, sir.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.479
Watch the swinging!

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.066
No swing!

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.063
Hey!

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.501
Hold on!

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.346
Medic!

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.959
<i>They are insisting civilians make
their way to the BART stations.</i>

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.839
<i>BART stations are
designated shelters.</i>

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.119
These patients are my responsibility.
Where are you taking them?

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.519
Across the bridges.
Critical and children only.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.506
Shelters are gonna fill up fast. Trust
me, they'll be safer outside the city.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.999
- I can take Sam.
- No, no, no.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.999
Ford's on his way.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.951
If you change your mind,
the buses leave in 10 minutes.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.704
Come on. Where are you, Ford?

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.144
This way! Keep them moving!

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.865
Let's go. Come on, come on.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.639
Hey! Where are they taking it?

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.479
Twenty miles offshore,
convergence point.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.623
We're gonna lure them there.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.462
Three birds, one stone.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.501
Wait!

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.879
Okay, Sammy.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.359
Laura, thank God.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.504
Sammy, you remember Laura.
She's Mommy's work friend, right?

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.999
She's gonna look after
you for a little bit.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.479
Daddy's gonna be here soon.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.959
And I'm gonna just come
get you right after.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.399
I promise.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.747
Okay.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.341
Okay?

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.319
Come on, sweetheart.
You're gonna come with me.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.110
Your mom's gonna stay and help.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.439
Elle, I'm gonna take
care of him, okay?

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.391
- Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy."
- Bye, Mommy.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.959
I got him! I got him!

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.439
Just sit down here.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.901
Sit, sit.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.719
Here.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.159
Did you lose consciousness?

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.781
I'm okay. Really, I'm fine.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.799
Sitrep, please.
Location of targets?

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.639
Male MUTO was spotted 30 miles
off the Farallon Islands.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.399
Showing seismic activity to
the east near Livermore.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.159
Should be the female closing in.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.039
Where's Godzilla?

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.759
Last contact was five hours ago.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.279
Maintaining a bearing of 053 degrees,
descending below a depth of 10,000 feet.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.519
Be here within the hour.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.869
<i>Residents are trying to get out
of the city any way they can.</i>

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.144
There's still buses on that bridge.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.159
Come on!

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.109
Let's get those busses
through. Let's go!

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.479
We're not gonna stop
the buses here.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.519
What?

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.959
I can't hear you. Oh, kids...

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.750
please be quiet.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.079
Move into position till you
have a clean line of sight!

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.262
Portside! Two hundred meters!

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.581
Brace!

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.759
Hold your fire.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.471
Hold your fire.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.864
Holy shit.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.639
Oh, shit!

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.341
- Hold on!
- Watch out!

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.065
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.502
Look out!

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.630
Get down! Get down in your seats!

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.867
Please! Get down!

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.667
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.182
Hey!

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.623
Move out! Move, move, move!

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.869
Striker! There's civilians on
the bridge. Hold your fire!

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.239
Open fire!

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.959
Move! Move!

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.839
- All right, get in there!
- Prepare to arm the device!

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.984
Ready! You got it?

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.180
I'm all set.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.226
Arming keys!

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.959
Three! Two! One!

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.039
What the hell was that?

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.199
EMP.

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.628
Engine's stopped! We lost power!

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.383
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.022
- Fire!
- Incoming!

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.359
Sam Brody was checked into the Oakland
Coliseum shelter an hour ago. He is safe.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.199
No record of Elle Brody.
Never made it out of the city.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.439
Well, check again. Please. I told her
to wait for me, and I didn't make it.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.639
They are trying to get everyone
downtown into subway shelters.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.559
I'm sure your wife is fine.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.119
Lieutenant Brody!

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.422
I'm looking for Lieutenant Brody.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.039
- Are you Brody?
- Yes.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:29.344
Okay. The male delivered the
warhead to the center of downtown.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.919
That puts 100,000 civilians
in the blast radius.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.079
We can't stop it remotely.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.359
An analog timer has been installed. The MUTOs
are frying electronics within a five-mile bubble.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.389
Means approaching from
ground is not an option.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.479
That's why we'll be conducting a
HALO insertion. Jumping altitude...

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.159
Will be 30,000 feet.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.839
We just skate to the top and drop.
Here.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.959
And here. If you don't hit a skyscraper
on the way, meet at rally point Charlie.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.879
- Right here. Good?
- Doctor, any guesses where to look?

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.386
Underground.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.319
If the MUTOs have spawned...

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.224
they'll be building a nest.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:04.039
Captain, when you
find the warhead...

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.159
- how long to disarm it?
- Without seeing...

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.319
- the analog mod, I couldn't even guess.
- Sixty seconds...

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.065
if I can access it.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.070
I retrofitted that device myself.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.919
Lieutenant Brody is our only...

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.268
EOD tech to survive
the train attack.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.384
Well, it sounds like
we could use you.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.719
With all due respect...

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.879
- if that doesn't work, then what's Plan B?
- The waterfront...

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.039
is located one klick downhill.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.239
Get the bomb to the
pier, onto a boat...

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.589
and as far away from the city as
possible before it detonates.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.705
Any questions?

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.679
- Dismissed.
- That's it.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.981
Let's move.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.506
Lieutenant?

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.519
They've already been briefed.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.399
We have no extraction plan.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.943
If you don't walk out,
you don't come back at all.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.749
Sir, I'll do whatever it takes.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.586
This alpha predator
of yours, doctor...

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.221
do you really think
he has a chance?

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.471
The arrogance of man is thinking
nature is in our control...

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.783
and not the other way around.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.144
Let them fight.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.239
Oh, Lord God, we give thanks...

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:31.359
for the opportunities
you have given us...

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.479
going together as comrades
to defend our great nation.

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.999
We thank you for the time and service
that you have given us together.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.239
Now as we are about to
leave one another...

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.463
let us have the strength...

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.746
Take position! Take position!

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.431
I saw Team 1 move to the east.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.879
Two of our team members didn't make it.
I heard bits and pieces on the radio.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.864
Snipers on the rooftop
moving into position.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.759
Here we go. Picking up the nuke.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.599
Which way?

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.999
One klick up the hill.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.159
We found the warhead.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.622
Let's go! Up the hill,
this direction. Move.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.231
Hey. Hey.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.746
Look.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:30.239
Let's move, let's move.

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.701
On my six.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.100
Sarge, get a look at this.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.319
We gotta get moving.
You got a signal yet?

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.587
I got it.

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:10.662
It's down there.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.627
All right, move, move!

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.751
Grab a line!

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.785
More light. Grazer.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.759
Right, clear out.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.902
Here we go.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.946
Whoa, look out, heads up!

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.821
How much time we got left?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.223
We have 27 mikes.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.709
We gotta get this thing down.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.519
Move, move, I got you!

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.026
Move it out, move it out!

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.799
Careful! Careful.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.519
And down in three...

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.319
two...

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.667
one.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.119
Let's get this cover off.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.262
Lieutenant, you're up.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.559
It's not budging. It's sealed shut.

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.719
We need time to open it.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.839
We don't have time!

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.439
We gotta get it on a boat.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.279
Grab the warhead! Let's move!

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.547
Go!

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.868
Easy.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.342
Easy, easy.

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.190
Move it out, guys!

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.079
Lieutenant, let's go!

01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.546
Lieutenant?

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.759
What the hell was that?

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.505
Holy shit! Did you see that?

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:56.906
This way.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.671
Faster, faster.

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.305

Find the ignition, sir?

Stay right here.

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:11.781
Quiet!

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.347
Quiet!

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.228
I hear some people. Come on!

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:20.319
This one's in bad shape. Come
on, grab my hand. We got you.

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.279
Help him up. Help him up.
