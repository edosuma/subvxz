00:37.370 --> 00:41.329
a JANGCHA production

00:42.509 --> 00:45.706
High Heel

01:04.563 --> 01:09.763
When I first saw YOON,
he was butt naked

01:11.037 --> 01:16.634
He sat like a lump of muscle
in the sauna

01:17.911 --> 01:25.784
He had scars whipped all over
as if he'd come from a battle

01:29.255 --> 01:34.215
They call him six-million-dollar-man
cuz he's Iike a cyborg

01:35.528 --> 01:40.266
He Iooked at me and smirked

01:40.266 --> 01:46.637
Asked me my name, so I said
"Who the hell are you? "

01:47.073 --> 01:48.404
Then he got up

01:49.909 --> 01:54.175
He stood in front of
where I was sitting

01:54.848 --> 01:56.679
What do you think I saw?

01:59.085 --> 02:00.518
Then...

02:01.187 --> 02:03.121
he slapped me Iike mad

02:04.824 --> 02:09.693
Looking at his dick,
I got battered...

02:14.767 --> 02:21.900
If I were the president, I would
either medal or execute him

02:30.216 --> 02:39.784
Apparently OON never needs bullets
or handcuffs to get his suspect

03:30.577 --> 03:33.637
It's the corner room on the first floor

03:43.423 --> 03:47.951
Those bullets won't be enough

04:17.490 --> 04:20.891
I won't be back in the country
til they drop the search

04:23.096 --> 04:29.001
Hope YOON's changed his job
when I come back

04:50.857 --> 04:53.917
I've been talking about you, bro

05:02.201 --> 05:05.638
He won't shoot!

05:05.638 --> 05:08.471
I told you he doesn't shoot!

05:12.178 --> 05:13.907
You're alone again

05:18.918 --> 05:21.587
I'd be in prison for 1 0 years

05:21.587 --> 05:28.789
You expect me to rot in jail
til I'm sixty?.

05:30.797 --> 05:34.733
No way in hell I'm going with you

05:35.168 --> 05:36.436
Bro!

05:36.436 --> 05:45.071
My boys will get you regardless
of flying bullets and blades

05:46.479 --> 05:53.942
Even after your six bullets, they'II
make sure you're dead

05:59.559 --> 06:01.288
Still want me?.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.016
Damn it!

08:18.731 --> 08:19.425
What?.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.861
There's...

08:36.249 --> 08:38.183
a fork...

08:52.932 --> 08:56.095
Directed by JANG JIN

09:19.892 --> 09:23.328
This is where you moved?.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.830
It's quiet and cheap

09:30.169 --> 09:31.864
I Iucked out!

09:38.377 --> 09:39.537
Good work

11:52.611 --> 11:57.048
Must be hard to get enough sleep
cuz of your job

11:58.250 --> 12:02.688
- Are you off?.
- I'm done for the day

12:02.688 --> 12:06.624
I'II take you home
You're under medication

12:09.695 --> 12:14.166
That's your prescription
It'II help you to sleep

12:14.166 --> 12:15.758
Let me know if you need more

12:16.902 --> 12:21.202
I booked you an appointment
in two weeks

12:25.778 --> 12:27.177
Joo-yeon...

12:29.148 --> 12:34.017
I won't be going to
the hospital anymore

12:36.622 --> 12:38.214
I'm quitting work

12:42.194 --> 12:43.388
I'm sorry...

12:45.030 --> 12:52.402
Are you gonna get the surgery?.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.306
Thanks for everything...

13:04.383 --> 13:06.452
Are you fucking deaf?.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.615
Go and see the site yourself!

13:10.422 --> 13:12.358
Detectives aren't a saint!

13:12.358 --> 13:15.628
Persuasion doesn't work for
gangs with knives

13:15.628 --> 13:19.265
It's hard to control them!

13:19.265 --> 13:20.061
What?.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.102
YOON never even shot a bullet!

13:23.102 --> 13:27.061
He fought barehanded!
That's not excessive confrontation

13:28.941 --> 13:34.747
He shot 2 bullets for 1 1 men
He saved your tax money!

13:34.747 --> 13:37.416
YOON's totally beat up too!

13:37.416 --> 13:40.820
He can't even remember his own name

13:40.820 --> 13:46.559
I'm sure he didn't mean to
punch the Iadies

13:46.559 --> 13:49.695
What were those bitches doing there?.

13:49.695 --> 13:53.563
I'm sure they're all druggies
anyway!

13:56.735 --> 14:01.140
The prosecutor's not saying anything
so what's the problem?.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.443
If you keep on making this a problem

14:04.443 --> 14:07.901
I'II tell the press and disclose everything

14:08.914 --> 14:09.744
Hang up!

14:14.386 --> 14:19.692
You should've at Ieast broken a bone
fighting eleven guys!

14:19.692 --> 14:22.525
My arm and shoulder hurt...

14:22.995 --> 14:27.099
You think you're independence army,
fighting by yourself?.

14:27.099 --> 14:30.569
And why the hell did you call 91 1?.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.038
Eeryone there knows your voice!

14:33.038 --> 14:35.404
Team work means nothing to you!

14:39.778 --> 14:40.745
What's this?.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.116
You already submitted your
resignation Ietter

14:44.116 --> 14:46.812
That was Iast quarter
Severance pay is different

14:47.853 --> 14:48.842
Yeah?.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.791
You Iittle smart alec!

14:54.526 --> 14:55.424
Sorry, sir

14:58.197 --> 15:03.769
You have one more mission, YOON
Go cut off Gang-dol's dick!

15:03.769 --> 15:09.108
Why should he cut off his dick?.
That's not his specialty

15:09.108 --> 15:12.645
There is no specialty in teamwork

15:12.645 --> 15:17.650
You his underling or Iawyer or something?.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.086
You told me to follow him Iike one

15:21.086 --> 15:22.815
He's not a cop anymore

15:24.857 --> 15:26.119
Let him go!

15:30.996 --> 15:34.227
Let me make you a drink
if you're not Ieaving

15:40.172 --> 15:43.005
Are you free tomorrow night?.

15:46.345 --> 15:47.744
For a date?.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.315
For work

15:56.855 --> 15:59.722
Did I tell you I sing here?.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.118
No

16:01.627 --> 16:05.064
Three times a day, $20 each time

16:05.064 --> 16:07.589
Sometimes I sing one song,
sometimes three

16:09.034 --> 16:10.524
So that's $60...

16:11.937 --> 16:17.376
plus $56 for 8 hours.
That's $1 1 6 per day

16:17.376 --> 16:21.779
$1 1 6 times twenty days per month
How much is that?.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.984
Over two grand!

16:32.491 --> 16:34.220
Good for you!

16:38.130 --> 16:40.189
It's the first time
I see you smile

16:42.534 --> 16:44.092
I didn't smile

17:27.012 --> 17:30.072
This arm is battered
Change arms!

17:30.849 --> 17:34.787
No, just shoot in this arm...

17:34.787 --> 17:38.357
I have a steel pin on this arm

17:38.357 --> 17:42.061
We got a cyborg here

17:42.061 --> 17:44.052
- Honey?.
- Yes

17:58.610 --> 18:02.948
Did you build a castle?.
Your muscles are not dissolving

18:02.948 --> 18:06.406
The boobs should've formed by now

18:07.986 --> 18:09.476
Don't Iift weights!

18:11.356 --> 18:13.153
I don't these days...

18:13.826 --> 18:18.997
Don't fight, swear, smoke, drink
or eat too much

18:18.997 --> 18:23.058
The shots don't work
if you Iive Iike a guy

18:23.735 --> 18:26.839
We can't put in the silicon
until it's softer

18:26.839 --> 18:27.863
Look up!

18:28.941 --> 18:31.967
Look at that Adam's Apple!

18:32.711 --> 18:37.349
Go to US to chisel that
Don't go to Thailand

18:37.349 --> 18:40.648
It'II cost you a house to
get you fixed up

18:46.125 --> 18:51.763
The person I told you about
originally runs a business

18:51.763 --> 18:54.891
She'II meet you only
cuz I begged her

18:55.467 --> 18:57.458
Thank you...

19:07.412 --> 19:11.348
How Iong will he be in the hospital?.

19:12.551 --> 19:18.615
The cops say two months
but I don't think that's enough

19:19.925 --> 19:23.554
They'II never give him two months

19:28.066 --> 19:29.693
YOON did this to you?.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.305
I'II do as you say, bro

19:36.475 --> 19:37.737
Should I wait

19:40.312 --> 19:42.712
or go cut his head off?.

19:51.156 --> 19:58.153
We Iost all this?.
Shit!

19:58.564 --> 20:00.432
Your brother was careless

20:00.432 --> 20:07.539
The cops took all, from company account
to statements and collaterals

20:07.539 --> 20:11.441
- And the Russian bond?.
- That too...

20:13.078 --> 20:14.636
Fuck!

20:17.049 --> 20:19.540
I told him to Ieave it to me!

20:20.419 --> 20:24.549
Or he should've kept it somewhere safe

20:27.459 --> 20:33.022
I even bought him an expensive German one!

20:33.332 --> 20:38.036
The old son-of-a-bitch Ioved it!

20:38.036 --> 20:44.009
Who the hell puts a safe in the balcony?.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.273
It's not a fucking orchid!

20:50.048 --> 20:52.517
I even wrote down the password and

20:52.517 --> 20:56.788
begged him to use the safe

20:56.788 --> 21:00.519
The confiscated documents were
in his desk drawers

21:02.494 --> 21:06.498
Then what was in the safe?.

21:06.498 --> 21:13.563
There was only the note
with the password on it

21:25.017 --> 21:27.008
Is YOON a detective?.

21:27.753 --> 21:32.122
You wouldn't know,
but he's a character

21:35.394 --> 21:36.725
I Iike him

21:42.868 --> 21:45.336
cuz he's a real man!

21:47.339 --> 21:50.536
It was a rainy day

21:52.110 --> 21:54.840
I just had to see him for myself

21:57.549 --> 21:59.244
It rained so much...

22:01.286 --> 22:07.555
that you'd be drenched without an umbrella

22:42.794 --> 22:48.164
He had mind-blowing kicks

22:49.234 --> 22:51.532
and his fists moved so fast
you couldn't see them

22:52.938 --> 23:00.106
He never even flicked a badge,
gun or handcuffs

23:01.012 --> 23:04.948
He was completely absorbed

23:17.396 --> 23:22.663
His clothes never got wet in the rain

23:24.669 --> 23:28.407
The crimes took place at a supermarket,
the gym across the street

23:28.407 --> 23:32.778
and a store parking Iot
two blocks down

23:32.778 --> 23:36.214
Four similar crimes took place in
two and half months

23:36.982 --> 23:44.081
He'd crash into the victims in alleys
and parking Iots and stab them

23:45.490 --> 23:49.928
In all the cases, the victims were
young women with expensive cars

23:49.928 --> 23:53.125
and they were all dressed in tight clothes

23:54.766 --> 23:59.567
The suspect might have a fetish
or just be sexually perverted

24:02.574 --> 24:07.102
The victims are traumatized by his
perverted sexual behavior

24:14.186 --> 24:19.055
We can't identify him because of
his motorcycle helmet

24:20.392 --> 24:22.127
We know where you'II be

24:22.127 --> 24:25.619
We'II be there, and we'II do four
rounds tonight

24:32.571 --> 24:36.803
She drives pretty well!

24:56.061 --> 24:56.925
Will you be okay?.

25:00.398 --> 25:04.027
I'II be behind you,
so don't worry

25:06.571 --> 25:09.301
- You'II get in the car?.
- No

25:11.977 --> 25:16.209
I'II follow you in another car

25:16.748 --> 25:22.120
There will be other cars following
you too, so don't worry

25:22.120 --> 25:27.492
If something happens,
don't scream Just run

25:27.492 --> 25:29.357
We'II take care of it

25:30.629 --> 25:33.826
Good!
Don't worry

25:40.472 --> 25:41.029
Okay

26:13.004 --> 26:14.301
Mr. YOON Ji-wook?.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.074
Y es

26:20.545 --> 26:22.103
Hello

26:22.681 --> 26:25.980
I thought you'd be a wacko
when I heard about you

26:28.720 --> 26:29.846
But you seem normal

26:40.198 --> 26:41.893
You a marine?.

26:44.302 --> 26:45.537
Sorry?.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.664
Isn't that your car outside?.

26:49.107 --> 26:49.903
Y es...

26:50.442 --> 26:53.775
What class are you?.
I'm 477

26:55.981 --> 26:58.176
I'm 670

27:07.092 --> 27:10.495
Stop that! Sit!

27:10.495 --> 27:11.257
Okay...

27:12.931 --> 27:16.833
Whose idea was it
for us to meet here?.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.096
Was it Dr. JIN?.

27:21.239 --> 27:25.733
Would you Iike to go somewhere else?.

27:27.178 --> 27:30.477
How many of us actually go to church?.

27:31.683 --> 27:36.143
I mean we completely
disgraced Genesis

27:38.857 --> 27:44.318
God made male and female!

27:45.563 --> 27:48.396
Not she-male!

27:54.806 --> 28:01.234
It angers God when his creatures
change what he's created

28:02.213 --> 28:07.617
That's our fate...
We Iive at the gate of hell

28:09.854 --> 28:18.421
What we did is different from
reclaiming Iand in the ocean

28:22.367 --> 28:23.732
He's probably forgotten

28:26.638 --> 28:28.128
cuz there are too many of us

28:31.509 --> 28:40.907
He can't care for all, especially
those behind him

28:43.955 --> 28:45.479
Like you...

28:54.032 --> 28:59.436
I couldn't take it at first

29:01.639 --> 29:03.402
I was turning into something weird

29:05.477 --> 29:06.705
I felt Iike going crazy

29:08.680 --> 29:09.840
It was disgusting

29:11.082 --> 29:18.147
So that's why you
became more man

29:20.425 --> 29:26.464
Destroying, using violence, cussing and fighting!

29:26.464 --> 29:31.868
and enlisting in the Marines

29:33.705 --> 29:39.337
And when all failed,
you just wanted to kill that bitch?.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.154
Whore!

31:16.741 --> 31:20.802
Surgery won't turn you
into a woman

31:21.713 --> 31:27.242
You become a woman
to get the surgery

31:33.925 --> 31:35.187
Look at her!

31:35.994 --> 31:37.086
Pretty, huh?.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.119
But she's still a tucker!

31:43.468 --> 31:47.632
It means she tucks it between the Iegs

31:50.341 --> 31:57.144
She fixed just the upper half of herself

31:59.918 --> 32:03.376
What about the one next to you?.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.154
She's a real dumb bitch!

32:08.359 --> 32:10.520
She's an ex Mr. Rodeo

32:11.162 --> 32:16.600
She fixed just the Iower half of herself

32:18.169 --> 32:19.761
Freaky, huh?.

32:32.317 --> 32:35.616
I'm really a woman

32:38.022 --> 32:39.387
Right...

32:42.093 --> 32:46.553
I really am a woman!

32:51.336 --> 32:53.566
I'm just doomed with an ugly face

32:54.906 --> 32:57.773
I can't make a Iiving with this face

32:59.944 --> 33:02.742
so I'm just pretending to be
a transgender

33:09.153 --> 33:11.018
I'm different down there

33:11.622 --> 33:16.025
I don't tuck it in or take pills
Feel it!

33:17.795 --> 33:18.896
It's okay
Feel it!

33:18.896 --> 33:21.364
It feels different
It's okay

33:25.570 --> 33:27.037
It's okay
Feel it!

33:30.041 --> 33:34.444
I'm sorry...

34:06.444 --> 34:07.779
Hi! Dodo

34:07.779 --> 34:09.143
He's a rookie

34:09.847 --> 34:12.077
Deck him out

34:12.583 --> 34:15.813
Find his size and give him style

34:18.790 --> 34:20.655
Ever tried on women's clothing?.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.818
Yes

34:24.295 --> 34:28.629
- Only at home, right?.
- Yes...

34:30.701 --> 34:33.135
Make-up?.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.704
Sometimes

34:37.975 --> 34:42.969
- At home, right?.
- Right

34:45.949 --> 34:47.143
Have a seat

34:52.790 --> 34:56.748
Your skin's soft

34:58.763 --> 35:01.732
Nice eyebrows

35:03.534 --> 35:05.263
You have Iong eyelashes

35:07.572 --> 35:08.766
You're pretty

35:12.610 --> 35:16.740
I'II make you over
And we'II go out together

35:20.618 --> 35:21.380
No way!

35:23.688 --> 35:25.485
Not yet...

35:28.693 --> 35:31.162
Hello, this is J.B. from Beauty Friends

35:31.162 --> 35:36.033
Nail art is perfect for your ugly nails

35:36.033 --> 35:41.733
Don't hide those stubby fingernails
Change them!.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.850
Everyone will stare at you

35:52.850 --> 35:57.048
T ake in those stares

35:58.089 --> 36:03.994
When you become numb to them,
you're a real woman

37:44.895 --> 37:46.385
What the!

37:51.335 --> 37:52.324
It's open!

37:53.504 --> 37:56.841
- Say good-bye
- Where're my slippers?.

37:56.841 --> 38:01.175
Thank you so much
We'II call you Iater

38:02.580 --> 38:05.049
- You could stay over
- It's so Iate

38:05.049 --> 38:07.017
That's why you should stay over

38:07.685 --> 38:10.119
I'm sorry

38:15.393 --> 38:17.662
Hello

38:17.662 --> 38:21.065
- Where you going so Iate?.
- For a jog

38:21.065 --> 38:24.101
You're so healthy

38:24.101 --> 38:26.370
We had guests tonight
He's our community rep

38:26.370 --> 38:28.201
Hello. Yikes!

38:29.407 --> 38:30.999
What the?.

38:35.046 --> 38:39.415
Weren't you on that TV show?.

38:45.756 --> 38:46.916
Y eah?.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.557
Hello?.

38:57.935 --> 38:59.300
We got Gang-dol

38:59.804 --> 39:05.208
We lured him in from the supermarket
and got him

39:06.243 --> 39:12.614
But your friend got a Iittle hurt

39:14.985 --> 39:17.078
Hurry over!.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.230
Bro!

39:30.768 --> 39:34.271
- Hey
- Where're they?.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.040
He's in interrogation

39:36.040 --> 39:37.029
Not him!

39:39.410 --> 39:42.709
The girl
Where's Jang-mi?.

39:45.816 --> 39:46.976
I n the meeting room...

39:48.219 --> 39:52.952
She wouldn't go to the hospital
before seeing you

40:19.283 --> 40:20.682
It hurts

40:24.522 --> 40:27.787
Is your jaw okay?.

40:31.729 --> 40:38.965
Let me know if it still hurts
tomorrow

40:43.307 --> 40:44.399
Let me see

40:58.489 --> 40:59.979
There's a sparkle...

41:16.373 --> 41:18.068
Why weren't you there?.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.377
Were you busy?.

41:26.116 --> 41:27.378
Y eah...

41:31.288 --> 41:32.516
I'm sorry

41:54.778 --> 41:59.717
Get me my Iawyer
You're wasting your time

41:59.717 --> 42:02.117
My blood and DNA...

42:05.589 --> 42:11.027
When I see women carrying something
or just after exercise

42:12.963 --> 42:17.195
I feel Iike bursting thinking about
the sweat on their body

42:17.935 --> 42:21.005
I wanna Iick and suck it all

42:21.005 --> 42:24.406
Don't pretend to be a psycho!

42:26.143 --> 42:31.949
I jerk off thinking about women's sweat

42:31.949 --> 42:35.553
It doesn't matter if it's a young
girl or a granny

42:35.553 --> 42:37.646
Quit your bullshit!

42:41.025 --> 42:43.084
This is what's gonna happen

42:45.996 --> 42:49.955
This is the video of your arrested

42:51.468 --> 42:57.270
You fought back hard
when we were rounding you up

42:58.709 --> 43:06.138
You fell and
rolled around pretty hard

43:07.451 --> 43:15.688
Hard enough to have broken your
shoulder, neck, waist, or knees

43:16.660 --> 43:22.758
You're fine now but they'II Iook
at this video as evidence

43:23.734 --> 43:32.574
This means I'II break your bones
right now

43:41.051 --> 43:48.025
I'II crack your bone every 1 5 minutes,
starting with your neck

43:48.025 --> 43:55.022
I can break them all at once, but
I want you to feel the pain slowly

43:55.966 --> 44:01.165
Don't mind that camera over there

44:01.772 --> 44:04.240
It has a chewed-up tape in it

44:05.009 --> 44:08.879
I'II say it was broken
and they'II buy it

44:08.879 --> 44:10.514
Look...

44:10.514 --> 44:14.814
I don't need your confession
It won't change anything

44:21.558 --> 44:26.052
It would've been easier
if you were a gang

44:27.564 --> 44:31.902
I wouldn't have to explain all this

44:31.902 --> 44:37.670
cuz you'd already know about me

44:38.308 --> 44:39.536
I'II write it

44:43.614 --> 44:48.313
I can't do it after I'm beat up
Let me do it now

44:49.887 --> 44:53.823
Then you do what you want

45:05.803 --> 45:07.498
I'II be back in 1 0 minutes

45:11.408 --> 45:13.273
You know it's strange

45:15.979 --> 45:18.379
but I'm so hard down there

45:21.518 --> 45:27.753
I'm getting so horny
Iistening to you preaching

45:29.126 --> 45:32.459
Iike a pretty girl whispering in my ear

45:35.199 --> 45:37.929
Wish I could fuck something

45:45.242 --> 45:49.303
Guess I'm turning into a psycho

45:55.719 --> 45:57.380
Asshole!

46:10.768 --> 46:12.167
Pervert!

46:36.293 --> 46:39.421
What, asshole!

47:41.091 --> 47:42.615
You're disgusting...

47:51.268 --> 47:52.496
Stop it!

47:57.241 --> 48:04.147
We're diseased...
We're sick!

49:02.906 --> 49:07.036
Jin-woo...
Jin-woo...

49:09.880 --> 49:12.474
Are you okay, bro?.

49:14.451 --> 49:15.884
What happened?.

49:17.020 --> 49:19.323
You hit the curb and turned over

49:19.323 --> 49:21.723
Don't you remember?.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.095
Anyone hurt?.

49:28.999 --> 49:32.799
- Am I broken anywhere?.
- No

49:35.405 --> 49:36.429
Gimme my coat

49:39.443 --> 49:42.537
- Bro?.
- Yeah?.

49:43.547 --> 49:47.540
I stopped them from taking
your blood test at the hospital

49:48.118 --> 49:51.349
Why?. I wasn't drunk

49:53.190 --> 49:59.220
You had needle bruises on your arm

50:12.376 --> 50:14.367
- Jin-woo...
- I never saw anything

50:17.748 --> 50:21.411
So you better stop taking it

50:25.889 --> 50:26.719
Jin-woo...

50:28.859 --> 50:30.793
It's not what you think

50:32.696 --> 50:34.323
I didn't see anything

50:35.532 --> 50:36.999
It's not drugs!

50:49.146 --> 50:50.841
Damn it!

51:03.360 --> 51:10.027
Is he obsessive-compulsive?.

51:11.334 --> 51:13.928
Or have several housekeepers?.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.955
He's Iiving with someone

51:35.892 --> 51:40.831
I knew he was seeing a young girl
but didn't know he was Iiving with her

51:40.831 --> 51:43.425
She's a glamorous one!

51:44.901 --> 51:47.233
Thought he'd be more macho

51:49.840 --> 51:53.571
I guess all men need excuses

51:55.879 --> 51:58.541
I don't see any drugs, sir

51:59.349 --> 52:04.254
I don't think he'd keep it at home

52:04.254 --> 52:07.591
By the way,
who told you YOON does drugs?.

52:07.591 --> 52:11.461
I heard it a Iong time ago

52:11.461 --> 52:16.233
One of our guys saw YOON's arms
when he was getting beat up

52:16.233 --> 52:18.201
He said it was covered
with needle bruises

52:18.201 --> 52:21.693
You can tell by Iooking at his eyes

52:22.005 --> 52:26.243
It's either he's high or wearing
circle contact Ienses

52:26.243 --> 52:27.801
That's enough!

52:29.613 --> 52:35.574
I don't think we should be searching
a cop house

52:36.353 --> 52:40.551
CIean up his house and go home

52:58.909 --> 53:00.467
Will you be okay, sir?.

53:03.146 --> 53:05.046
I wanna see him
since I'm here

53:08.718 --> 53:11.482
- Call us Iater, sir
- Rest well

53:41.084 --> 53:44.918
It's perfect for your business trips

53:47.457 --> 53:49.049
Why's he watching this shit?.

54:26.663 --> 54:30.155
Excuse me for Ietting myself in

54:41.311 --> 54:43.176
Get me a cup of coffee

54:46.249 --> 54:50.242
- Heard you're quitting
- So?.

54:52.122 --> 54:55.819
You're Ieaving the police force
on your own

54:57.127 --> 55:05.592
You know Seoul's filled with guys
who wanna kill you as soon as you retire?.

55:06.503 --> 55:11.304
So you're here cuz you're so worried?.

55:12.676 --> 55:18.706
You can tell how much I Iike you,
right?.

55:20.050 --> 55:25.386
I'd put posters of you on my wall
cuz I'm your fan

55:26.856 --> 55:31.088
I don't know what you're gonna do
when you quit

55:32.062 --> 55:34.030
but will you be my buddy?.

55:34.664 --> 55:36.689
I'II help you out

55:38.034 --> 55:44.837
Rest abroad for a few years, come back
and tell me good stories

55:46.209 --> 55:49.770
Whether it's drugs or girls,
you'II need money

55:51.314 --> 55:55.952
And I guarantee, you'II be dead even
before you pack up

55:55.952 --> 56:01.356
You did kill a Iot of guys
I'II protect you from them

56:02.392 --> 56:07.091
So you're telling me to quit and
become a gang?.

56:09.699 --> 56:13.829
It's called Privileges of Former Post

56:14.471 --> 56:18.498
Prosecutors and Iawyers fight
in the court

56:19.275 --> 56:22.512
But when the prosecutors quit,
Iawyers support them

56:22.512 --> 56:24.776
We're the same

56:27.250 --> 56:28.808
Brother YOON!

56:30.453 --> 56:32.819
Form ties with me!

56:45.435 --> 56:50.463
Enough bullshit
What do you really want?.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.143
That's all

56:53.143 --> 56:55.378
To be buddies

56:55.378 --> 56:56.606
Enough!

57:00.016 --> 57:02.576
Geez

57:05.588 --> 57:15.896
Tell me what you're gonna ask me
after bribing me

57:30.647 --> 57:34.551
There are sheets of paper from HUH's
confiscated documents

57:34.551 --> 57:40.353
that are useless to the police
and prosecutors anyway

57:41.724 --> 57:45.295
They're Russian oil company bonds

57:45.295 --> 57:48.822
The Russian government will buy
that company next spring

57:49.399 --> 57:54.804
It's worth nothing much now,
but once it becomes a national bond

57:54.804 --> 57:57.034
the price will skyrocket

57:59.576 --> 58:03.603
It would be mine
when my brother is jailed

58:05.381 --> 58:09.511
But since it's not in my hands,
I feel completely frustrated

58:10.820 --> 58:18.454
Real friends Iisten to each other
and help each other, right?.

58:21.598 --> 58:27.628
So you've gone insane
cuz you need a friend?.

58:32.775 --> 58:35.266
- You
- Y es?.

58:36.846 --> 58:42.148
Did you smoke in here?.

58:47.924 --> 58:52.384
Did you smoke in here?.

58:54.898 --> 58:57.025
Damn it!

59:03.573 --> 59:04.904
- Hello?.
- Hi!

59:07.777 --> 59:09.546
Where's Mr. YOON?.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.844
- He's got one more
- Sorry?.

59:12.415 --> 59:16.613
He has work
He might stop by Iater

59:17.987 --> 59:20.512
AIways so busy!

59:21.758 --> 59:24.522
- Would you Iike something?.
- Beer...

59:25.828 --> 59:29.465
Actually, people drink hard Iiquor
here, right?.

59:29.465 --> 59:32.457
You can have anything you want

59:39.175 --> 59:41.905
How did you meet Ji-wook?.

59:44.647 --> 59:48.051
He just came to me by chance

59:48.051 --> 59:51.646
That's weird!

59:53.990 --> 59:56.788
Are you two dating?.

59:58.361 --> 59:59.362
Sorry?.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:06.530
Ji-wook doesn't talk much
but you two seem kinda close

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.763
I don't even know his name

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.544
He probably doesn't know mine either

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.372
He does

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:26.787
He called you Jang-mi that day
when you got hurt

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:45.502
He called me Jang-mi?.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.944
Yes...

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:55.606
It's time, Sunny

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.989
I have to go sing now

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:14.859
No matter how much I ache for you

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.205
Nothing will change

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:32.179
I know it's cuz you have nothing
but tears

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:39.929
I'm standing on the crosswalk

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:47.870
holding still in time like a fool

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:53.433
Nothing will change

01:01:54.711 --> 01:02:00.081
Should I turn back
Should I run to you

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:06.749
I'm standing on the crosswalk

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:18.034
holding still in time like a fool
in case you call for me

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:27.877
Come before me please
When it's time

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.037
What happened to your hand?.

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:35.010
I was goofing around with a beer cap

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.084
Looks Iike a ring, huh?.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:50.630
I'm moving to Seoul

01:02:51.501 --> 01:03:01.778
I'm standing in time like a fool
in case you call for me

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:08.317
Come before me please

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:12.617
When it's time
When the lights turn

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:21.222
Expect about 20 grand for the tests
and surgery

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:25.498
Use the money well
if you want good results

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:34.109
It's better to get your boob job
and other surgeries within a year

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:40.272
I'm worried about how you'II make
a Iiving as a woman

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:47.056
Gays survive cuz people think
they're creative and unique

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:51.494
But not transgenders, especially
poor ones

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.553
They're not the same as poor women

01:03:55.431 --> 01:04:00.733
That's the most tragic moment
Know why?.

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:10.409
Cuz that's when the world turns
against you, even family

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:39.041
Is YOON really quitting?.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.777
I don't know what he's onto

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:45.110
It's not Iike he's got anything better to do

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.351
Nice face!

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.361
How about you?. You hurt?.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:04.489
Y es, my shoulder...

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:12.103
You should've complied
when he showed you his badge

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.944
Look at that face

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:19.148
It seems Iike there's a mistake

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:22.885
My client never fought back or resisted

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:26.252
Detective YOON
never gave an arrest warrant

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:30.815
Are you broke, Mr. HUH?.

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:34.328
You shouldn't skimp out on Iawyer

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:39.127
Prosecutor HONG, can we see you
alone?.

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:43.631
Without the detectives too

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.505
Mr. HUH can stay

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:47.399
Gimme a sec

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:53.015
Let me explain briefly

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:58.254
First, who is executed these days
for something Iike this?.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:00.623
You just want the media highlight,
right?.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.147
Hey!

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.325
You think this is a joke?.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.538
We're talking gangs, fraud, drug
smuggling, dodging taxes

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:19.565
and murder instigation.

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.544
What penalty should he get?.

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:25.548
Murder instigation?.
How can you verify that?.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:28.384
You're dumb as hell, old man

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:31.876
- Excuse you!
- Continue

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:39.491
Let me explain

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.933
You're in for the Iong haul

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:46.026
I know this isn't common

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.704
Gangs don't instigate murder these days

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:53.209
But you fucked up by instigating
the murder over the phone

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:56.579
And by next week, I'II have that
recorded tape

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.546
Come on!

01:06:57.546 --> 01:07:00.811
You think it's invalid
cuz it's illegal wiretapping?.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:03.413
Well, he's shit outta Iuck

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:08.983
One of the men you hired was
an illegal immigrant

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:13.162
We made some deals with him

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:17.531
He brought in a few cell phones
that have all the evidence

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:22.705
One of them belonged to Mr. CHO

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.971
It had recordings of all the phone conversations

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:35.383
This is why you use your own
men to get things done

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.087
and not hire externally

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:41.818
I'II be damned

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:57.428
Split your sentence with your
brother HUH Gon

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.333
What you need is reduced sentence
and me, news headline

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:09.012
Nailing the HUH brothers is better
than executing just you

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.617
We'II follow your decision

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.182
- Good work
- Welcome back

01:08:55.764 --> 01:09:00.564
Give them the documents
and pack up, Ji-wook

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:07.332
- Come on, sir!
- He's Ieaving anyway

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:12.508
I processed your resignation
this afternoon

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:18.419
You seemed Iike you wanted him forever
Now you're kicking him out!

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:30.866
Cheers to almighty YOON's return
to ordinary Iife!

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:33.002
Cheers!

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:41.777
Remember when YOON disguised
as a woman and staked out?.

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:47.082
I still wanna puke when I think
about him dressed Iike that

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:50.210
I should've slept with him!

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.690
Now who's gonna be our woman?.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.791
You!
You have the boobs!

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:59.522
- Me?.
- He'II do it!

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.636
Bro!
You better be damn happy!

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:18.344
If you Iive Iike a fool,
I'II put you in jail!

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.585
I'II be good...

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:26.214
- You sending your boyfriend away?.
- I Iove you, man

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:07.718
I have no more work for you
Don't come here again

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.425
Okay...

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:15.463
I won't be here

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.040
I quit my job

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.235
Why did you come to me?.

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.680
Umm...

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.748
You know me, right?.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:21.800
Your sister has your eyes

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.121
Since when?.

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:58.834
Why...

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:05.135
Why did you come to me?.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.901
I love you

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.085
It's a couple ring

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:56.201
What a surprise

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.676
I didn't think you'd really show up

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.620
- Put the money in my car
- No

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:18.493
I deposited it to your account

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:27.437
I went to the bank myself and
I even smiled at the security camera

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:35.977
I can't have you saying that
someone else sent you that money

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.181
That's a real man, right?.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:49.563
You'II have to wait for the bond

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.692
I can't steal documents

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:57.735
I'II get it out when it's under investigation

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:04.977
Let me ask you something

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:10.049
Do you really need the money?.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:18.583
You that desperate to need
my money?.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:34.436
I Iike that guy

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.571
He's so cool

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.940
Buy why's he accepting my money?.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.887
He doesn't seem so cool anymore

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:58.395
Something feels fucked up

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.394
Sir

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.229
Your brother wants to see you

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:23.487
It's Iate at night

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:33.426
Brother...
Let me ask you for a favor

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:59.656
You gone senile, asshole?.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:12.734
You want me to go to jail
to save your pathetic Iife?.

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:16.199
You Iittle...

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.888
It's inevitable

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:34.553
We're not real brothers

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:48.642
Find YOON!

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.351
Fuck!

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:07.024
He knew about all this!

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:14.934
The motherfucker's a backstabber!

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.032
The fucking asshole!

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.139
Find YOON!

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:31.352
Stab him, shoot him and
fuck him up

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.579
But bring him alive!

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:44.632
Kill everyone around him!

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:55.000
If I'm caught, do I share the
sentence with bro?.

01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:01.305
What about our money?.

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:08.051
If your brother has made deals
with the prosecutor Mr. HONG

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.991
you might have nothing Ieft

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.788
Arrest warrant hasn't been issued yet

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:23.330
You can still Ieave the country
so wait and see

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:15.816
What is this?.

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.570
What, you assholes?.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.769
Let's make a deal...

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:16.371
You and I...

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.296
You piece of shit!

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:51.779
- How dare you terrorize us?.
- What are you talking about?.

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:58.353
You better stop or I'II kill you

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.121
What did I do?.

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.891
You're done, asshole!

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.756
- Jin-woo!
- Y es?.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.561
- Put him in detention!
- Y es, sir!

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:16.871
- What did I do?.
- Stay down!

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:25.208
Where's Ji-wook?.

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.415
Can't reach him yet

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:32.187
If you do, get someone
or you stay with him

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:32.915
Y es, sir

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:34.955
What the!

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:44.429
What was YOON doing here
with these faggots?.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:53.007
We're Iooking for your client

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.771
I don't know anything!

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.844
Didn't ask anything yet

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:04.382
You know the guy with steel pins
in his arms and Iegs?.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.319
No...

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.153
Turn on the switch

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:17.993
Open wide!

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:34.881
You treated the steel pins in this guy?.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.082
Now you remember him?.

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:45.324
He's not a man...

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.475
Hello?.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:06.812
There's something weird about YOON

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:16.452
- I'm sorry to make you wait
- That's okay

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:20.828
Do you remember me?.
I was here with Ji-wook

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:22.591
Of course

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:24.958
Where's Ji-wook?.

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.694
We gotta find him

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.201
I didn't know, but he's moved

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:38.801
Do you know where he is?.

01:28:58.199 --> 01:28:59.325
I'm so pretty

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.379
Congratulations

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:43.872
You're going for your surgery
early tomorrow morning?.

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:58.485
HUH Gon killed HONG, right?.

01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:03.453
Guess you can't arrest without evidence

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:11.239
Never mind!
You don't work with us anymore

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:11.967
Jin-woo...

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:19.247
Just go and kill them anyway!
That's the only way

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:24.549
That's not easy without you!

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:36.330
There's no one Iike you
in the world anymore

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:56.651
I have voice mail from HUH and
record of bank deposit from him

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:58.448
Request for arrest warrant with that

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:17.828
Sorry you saw me Iike this

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:25.209
I never touched that money

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.276
Damn it, Ji-wook!

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:34.879
Is this worth it?.

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:38.425
Worth everything you have?.

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:49.936
That's enough...

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.299
He struggled for a long time

01:31:57.111 --> 01:32:02.276
Ji-wook agonized to hide
the woman in him

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:10.585
Then one day, he told me that
he should just face it

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:46.687
Bro, it's me Jin-woo

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:54.667
I forgot to tell you something...

01:32:57.038 --> 01:33:06.174
When I saw you,
I forgot the fact

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.075
that you are a man

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:19.525
You Iooked so pretty

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:26.397
Really truly pretty

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:39.206
You're a Iucky bastard!
You're Iiving two Iives

01:33:45.486 --> 01:33:51.049
I guess you were the biotic woman,
not six million dollar man

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:00.726
Damn it!

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:11.277
Thank you, Jin-woo...

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:21.914
Hold on!

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:26.160
Oh my God!

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.495
I'm okay

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:31.666
You gonna take him alone?.
Do you know where he Iives?.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.395
I'II take him to the police station

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.668
Bye!

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:39.771
I'm fine!

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:41.367
Where's your car key?.

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:47.305
It was on the table
I'II be right back

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:50.342
What are you doing?.

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:55.580
Jang-mi...

01:34:57.158 --> 01:35:02.118
You Iike Ji-wook a Iot, right?.

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:04.425
What?.

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:16.540
What if we can't see him again?.

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:21.680
You're really drunk...

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.139
I'II be back

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:06.746
Good night!

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:25.400
He's probably on the plane, right?.

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.772
I miss him...

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:41.512
Crazy bitch!

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:30.494
You thought I'd be shocked?.

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:33.136
There are people Iike you

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:38.838
Others scream and freak out
You're Iucky you came to me

01:38:45.719 --> 01:38:51.592
The opposition parties stressed on
a united voice to protect NLL

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:56.897
and emphasized on the importance of
peace-keeping for national security

01:38:56.897 --> 01:39:01.835
A police officer was murdered in
Seoul at around 2 a.m. this morning

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:07.174
Detective KIM Jin-woo was found stabbed
a dozen times in his chest and stomach

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:15.416
He was moved to a nearby hospital
where he passed away

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:19.053
The gangbuster detective was seen

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:21.388
entering a building the night before

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:26.493
and police are investigating other
security cameras

01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:34.068
The police are investigating for
clues to KIM's death

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:37.469
Thought you'd left by now

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:40.869
Or will you come here?

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:49.343
Thought you might not change
your mind just cuz your friend's dead

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:54.911
So I got a Iil' Iady with a flower
tattoo on her back

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:03.920
But if you were just playing around
with her, I guess you won't come

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:11.103
I don't know who I'm gonna kill next

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:14.634
Why am I risking my Iife for this?.

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:23.076
Guess I've seen too much of
the World, Iike you

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:44.831
He went silent
when I mentioned you

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:03.485
Take a nap

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:12.031
Go wait, and I'II return YOON

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:20.536
Give her a shot
Put her to sleep

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:36.220
Pour the gasoline before he comes

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:41.989
Then burn her crisp

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:14.688
I promised your brother that
I'II protect you wherever you are

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.376
Should I wait for you?.

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:11.508
Cuz you're Ieaving your bag

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:18.915
I'm here...

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:21.614
Going in

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:48.742
You brought a knife?.
He just wanted a word with you

01:44:56.823 --> 01:45:01.783
You smell nice!
It must be a good perfume

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:10.835
Was anyone of you there Iast night?.

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:13.999
when Detective KIM died?.

01:45:16.710 --> 01:45:18.507
He was so drunk

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:23.173
It was easy killing him

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:08.920
On my way

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:47.731
You're a girl?.

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:51.026
How can I fight a girl?.

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:05.277
You call this a girl?.

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:56.758
Guess you didn't Iike your welcome

01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:01.589
You'd be a perfect gangster

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:08.570
Where is she?.

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:12.938
How funny!

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:17.515
Why are you here?.

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:26.349
You came all this way back
just for a girl?.

01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:33.194
I just don't get you

01:49:56.690 --> 01:50:01.753
Let her go...

01:50:03.697 --> 01:50:04.965
What can I do?.

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:06.193
Fuck!

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:15.998
What could I possibly want from you?.

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:23.615
From a bitch
who threw away everything?.

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:35.088
She's alive, right?.

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:38.727
PIease, buddy?.

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:59.852
Guess you really Ioved her, huh?.

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.592
Damn!

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:10.757
I feel sorry now

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:33.002
Enough!

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:46.992
Our boss is fucked

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:54.857
You think we can save him?.

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:16.115
What a man you are!

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:28.262
Wrap it up!

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:34.702
He said send her home
if she's still alive

01:53:35.742 --> 01:53:38.233
Really?.

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:46.950
Bro, that was his dying wish

01:53:55.094 --> 01:53:57.028
We're done, sir

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:00.832
It was done with ease

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:07.898
Don't worry, sir
I'II take care of everything

01:56:45.565 --> 01:56:48.830

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:48.193
