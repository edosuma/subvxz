00:14.320 --> 00:15.526
Dad?

00:17.400 --> 00:18.606
What is it?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.486
What is it you want?

00:26.280 --> 00:30.682
Ginger ale?
Do you want a ginger ale, Dad?

00:31.320 --> 00:32.765
He can't have that!

00:32.920 --> 00:34.604
Why not? The other nurse
didn't say anything.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.848
Well, I'm saying something...
carbonation.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.525
It's better for him.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.324
Do you really think it matters?

00:40.480 --> 00:42.289
Yes, I do.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.088
We tried, Dad.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.164
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.321
- You're awake?
- Sorta.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.686
Okay.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.848
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.651
Thank you. Who is that guy?

03:20.840 --> 03:23.320
Somebody. Did you use the chamomile?

03:23.480 --> 03:24.720
Of course.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.801
Is this any good?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.291
"New York Times" didn't care
for it too much.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.171
- I liked the first one better.
- I'm sure.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.527
- Hey, have a good day.
- You, too.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.603
Hey, don't forget to pick up
the wine for dinner tonight.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.841
Yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.843
- See ya.
- See ya.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.201
It all looks very good.
You're gonna be just fine.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.203
I can't believe we just bought a house.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.362
- Yeah.
- Feel like I have writer's cramp.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.409
It is a lot.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.722
I just need to get the manager
to sign this

03:54.920 --> 03:56.570
and you can start picking out furniture.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.324
Be right back.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.381
If you can please sign this,
we'll be done over there.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.323
Hanson and McKay.

04:11.862 --> 04:14.330
God is gonna
strike me dead for this one.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.526
- Nolan.
- Hmm?

04:18.680 --> 04:21.490
- Are you happy?
- Excuse me?

04:21.640 --> 04:23.802
Are you happy?

04:23.960 --> 04:27.248
I guess as much as anyone, you know?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.926
I mean, here at your job, our bank.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.565
Of course.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.722
They can wait.
There's no rush for the...

04:33.880 --> 04:35.723
two over there.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.604
I mean, you've been here at this branch,

04:37.760 --> 04:39.330
what, 25 years now, right?

04:39.480 --> 04:41.209
- Almost 26.
- Impressive.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.646
Thank you.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.842
You must have thought about
making a change from time to time.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.286
I've been here a long time.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.408
I know the people,
the customers, you know.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.365
You know, there's a job coming up
at the Belvedere Park branch.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.040
You'd be branch manager, like me.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.489
A bump in pay, some perks.
You'd be running the show.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.051
You interested?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.328
Wow, that's... that's a big surprise.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.608
Well, it all hinges
on Ralph Blydon, of course.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.091
- Regional president.
- Yes.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.284
I talked you up, and he'd like to meet.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.887
He suggested dinner at his home,
something intimate.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.448
Me, my wife Gloria,
you and your wife... Joy?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.080
- Joy, yeah.
- Joy, sure, of course.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.527
- Don't mind them.
- Okay.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.206
My secretary will contact you
with the date and details.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.601
We'll see where it goes.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.689
- And don't look so worried.
- Okay.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.810
This'll be good for you.
It's a good thing.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.522
Of course. Thank you. I'll head back.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.514
Of course.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.361
Oh, perfect. Mm.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.921
Just need another 30 minutes.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.406
Mm.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.006
All we have to do now is let
the wine breathe and we're good to go.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.367
The wine. I completely forgot.
Oh, damn it.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.170
Oh, no, if we don't have
a reasonable Cabernet for Winston,

05:59.320 --> 06:00.446
he'll pout all the way through dessert.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.601
I'll go out and grab one.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.649
You don't have time to go
to the wine store, Nolan.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.001
I'll hit the mini-mart
around the corner.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.525
- Nolan.
- Babe, I know.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.609
Only the best for the professor, please.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.643
Oh, but hurry! Please.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.280
Of course!

06:13.440 --> 06:16.011
This kid was an English
comp grad student

06:16.160 --> 06:18.721
- and he asked me who Rushdie was.
- A grad student?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.326
- Yeah, Patty was there, right?
- Yeah.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.444
I considered weeping publicly,
but then I thought, what the hell?

06:24.600 --> 06:27.001
I just said, "Well, he's
an archeologist or something."

06:27.160 --> 06:29.083
Yeah, no, I think that you said
he was an astronaut.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.921
I said he was an astronaut.
The last astronaut on the moon.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.283
Well, this food was excellent,
and the company's even better.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.603
And this wine was undoubtedly $7.99.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.886
Well, it's a good week.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.122
I was wondering how long
it would take you to notice.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.569
Well, I have a theory
about fine wine, which is that...

06:48.760 --> 06:52.082
- Oh, do tell.
- ...nobody really knows

06:52.240 --> 06:55.761
or even likes it or opera or...

06:55.920 --> 06:56.967
- Foreign movies.
- ...foreign movies.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.281
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.891
- Yes.
- Not foreign movies.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.104
No, but really.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.370
No, but, Joy, this meal
has been very delicious, thank you.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.851
I think it's just the fourth glass

07:09.000 --> 07:11.601
of your fine wine
that's finally gotten to him.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.890
I'm fine. Was that too...
was that too loud?

07:15.080 --> 07:16.411
- No. No.
- No? Oh, good.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.130
You're good.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.841
Well, would one of you blow into
the tube in my car so I can start it?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.929
I can't take credit
for this delicious meal.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.651
It's Nolan who is the cook.
I just supervise.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.889
- Well, it's very good, Nolan.
- Oh, nice job.

07:30.040 --> 07:33.010
Joy, I saw that you're reading
that new Hopkins novel.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.322
You know, I'm gonna finish it,
but I'm not a fan.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.370
Okay, but before you damn it, know this.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.245
- He's a pretentious twat.
- My God.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.289
I think Joy would say it
a little more demurely,

07:43.480 --> 07:45.721
- but thank you.
- Yes, I imagine that she would.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.882
Yeah, well,
I don't do demure, all right?

07:48.040 --> 07:50.611
I mean, I read it on our cruise,

07:50.760 --> 07:53.923
and if I wasn't afraid
it was an environmental hazard,

07:54.080 --> 07:55.206
I would have tossed it overboard.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.931
How was that cruise?
That was Alaska, right?

07:58.120 --> 07:59.770
- Yeah.
- It was six days...

07:59.920 --> 08:01.001
- It was very nice.
- ...of gliding through the ice.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.764
Only thing missing was whale blubber.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.485
Come on, you loved it.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.961
As long as you were standing
between me and Alaska,

08:07.120 --> 08:08.406
it was beautiful.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.040
Yes, it was very romantic.
It was very nice.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.884
We should think about a cruise sometime.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.327
- Yeah. That'd be great.
- Yeah?

08:16.480 --> 08:19.211
Wait, whoa. Nolan take a vacation?

08:19.360 --> 08:21.203
What, am I missing something?

08:21.360 --> 08:23.646
Oh, it's not unheard of, you know?

08:23.960 --> 08:25.928
That bank of yours will likely collapse,

08:26.080 --> 08:29.607
which is what it's likely gonna do
when you take that promotion.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.808
What is it, branch manager
at Belvedere Park, huh?

08:32.960 --> 08:36.726
Swanky, as the kids say,
and that deserves yet another toast.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.688
Belvedere Park?

08:39.799 --> 08:41.621
Yeah.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.725
Or... or not.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.086
So good to see you.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.765
- Thank you.
- It was a great night.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.769
Somebody stole my sleeve.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.962
Get the little boy in his jacket.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.282
And make sure
my mittens are still attached.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.441
- Take care.
- See you, buddy.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.206
- It was great to meet you.
- So nice to meet you, too, bye.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.328
- Come again, okay?
- I hope I can.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.689
- Look at his hat.
- Put his hat on for him.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.729
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.006
Yeah.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.685
She's... she's good.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.841
Sweet, really.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.321
Yeah, young, but she's smart.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.720
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.008
I'll get the dishes.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.003
So when were you gonna
tell me about the promotion?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.764
Well, Winston was a little premature.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.008
Yeah, but you told him, but not me.

09:28.160 --> 09:32.023
Well, you know Winston.
We were just talking and, boom.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.690
I'll get it.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.726
Hello?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.722
Yes.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.211
I'll be right there.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.045
What is it?

09:52.960 --> 09:56.681
A cardiac event in a stroke patient
isn't that unusual.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.889
The good news is we caught it in time.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.929
If you'd like to see him,
it can only be for a few minutes.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.565
He needs his rest.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.324
It's okay.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.086
I'd rather let him get his rest, then.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.208
I'll visit when it's more appropriate.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.004
Are you all right?

10:15.160 --> 10:16.286
Of course.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.488
I'll come back.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.122
Hey, Daddy.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.009
Can I get a ride?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.244
Driving slow enough.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.761
- Yo!
- Jesus!

11:42.920 --> 11:44.206
Watch where you're going.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.044
God.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.248
- Fucking asshole.
- Jeez.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.250
God, are you all right?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.965
I just didn't see you coming
across the street there, you know?

12:01.400 --> 12:04.291
It's just, like I have this fear, a phobia
of hurting people, you know, and...

12:07.080 --> 12:08.491
Just...

12:11.400 --> 12:15.530
Sorry, I'm just a little distracted
by all this, you know, it's...

12:17.880 --> 12:19.245
Well, you wanna give me a ride?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.880
Excuse me?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.963
I asked if you wanna give me a ride.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.846
Sure.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.724
Okay.

12:31.880 --> 12:36.681
Sorry, I just wasn't paying attention.
There's a lot to look at here.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.731
I'm glad you're okay 'cause I have
this fear of hurting people.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.565
So where would you like me to take you?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.362
All right, so you're
gonna pull in there.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.285
You blow me, it's 100.
I blow you, it's 150.

12:50.440 --> 12:54.081
More, we can do that, but we just
need to move outta here, okay?

12:54.240 --> 12:55.571
Yes, of course, I...

12:57.280 --> 13:00.124
What?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.760
It's just that, um...

13:02.920 --> 13:04.206
What, you have a wife?

13:04.360 --> 13:06.567
Yes. Why?

13:08.080 --> 13:09.127
Oh, fuck.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.123
Oh, my God.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.930
- You need to drive.
- What?

13:13.080 --> 13:15.128
You need to drive now.
Drive the fucking car.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.448
Yeah, that's good.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.602
We could do it like that.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.331
- I'd like a room for...
- $60.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.766
$60, thank you.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.488
This is a little strange for me, um...

14:05.120 --> 14:07.122
Guess we can make some coffee.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.449
Do you want some coffee?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.090
No, I'm good.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.607
How long do we have here?

14:14.760 --> 14:16.728
An hour. It's up to you.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.207
It's complimentary with the room.
I guess I'll make it.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.005
I...

14:36.320 --> 14:39.585
I used to like being in motels
when I was a little kid.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.121
It was kinda neat
just being somewhere else.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.083
It's like...

14:47.440 --> 14:48.851
Fuck.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.923
Oh, my barista days are numbered.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.171
It was fun, you know,
just being somewhere else.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.646
Where are you from?

15:03.840 --> 15:06.207
- Ohio.
- Oh.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.771
Dayton.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.211
No, you don't need to do that.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.600
What?

15:20.560 --> 15:22.403
You're fine just the way you are there.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.089
Okay. Hey, it's your time.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.884
Yeah.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.405
I can smoke?

15:33.560 --> 15:35.722
Of course, I don't know
if this is a smoking room.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.407
But look at this...
I guess you can. I don't know.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.209
So, what, you wanna touch me,
or what are we gonna do here?

15:49.880 --> 15:51.484
I don't even know your name.

15:53.080 --> 15:57.165
Leo.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.891
I'm Nolan.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.008
That's my mother's maiden name.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.128
She died six months ago.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.521
I was holding her hand.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.965
It's weird, she was just, like...

16:11.880 --> 16:13.006
People leave, you know?

16:13.200 --> 16:16.204
But for some people,
it just doesn't seem fair.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.211
I'd like to give you more,
if that's okay.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.771
Money?

16:34.920 --> 16:36.081
Yeah.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.410
In the car you mentioned
some numbers, and, you know,

16:41.600 --> 16:44.331
I'd like to pay you more.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.811
So, why are you married?

16:53.720 --> 16:55.131
I love her.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.810
You love her.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.201
Yeah.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.930
I do.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.050
You can just drop me off
where you found me.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.363
Is there a way I can reach you?

17:10.520 --> 17:11.964
I shut off my cell phone,

17:12.119 --> 17:14.167
but you can always find me
where you did.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.607
Or you can give me
your number, if you want.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.930
I'd like that.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.885
Thank you, Leo.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.601
So, I should call you?

17:42.760 --> 17:43.921
Yes, please.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.364
- All right.
- Yeah.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.928
How's your father?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.491
- He'll be okay.
- Mm.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.129
- Go back to sleep, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.771
They're all so young.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.327
Savages.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.245
You give them a book, they're gonna
look for the on/off switch.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.131
You know, back in our day,
we used to walk a mile across campus

19:22.280 --> 19:24.044
with 12 pounds of books on our backs.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.602
Yeah, and then the railroad
came to town.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.666
That was a great day.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.490
Hey! Look who's here.

19:30.640 --> 19:34.167
Yeah, of course he's here.
It's Tuesday, isn't it?

19:34.360 --> 19:36.044
Nolan, thank you so much
for dinner the other night.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.770
- It was very nice.
- Of course.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.127
I told Liz to bring over
some tiramisu for you guys.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.369
Yeah. Okay, but we gotta get going.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.601
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.808
All right, well, Nolan, nice to see you,

19:46.960 --> 19:48.485
and hello to Joy, of course.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.369
- Of course. Of course.
- Of course.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.005
You've been with her four months now.
What is that, a record for you?

19:56.160 --> 19:59.642
Yeah, well, she wants to move
to New York after graduation.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.567
She'll outgrow it.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.481
Once she realizes I'm not the only guy
who knows who Rushdie is.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.170
Ah.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.449
Remember how bad
I wanted us to move to New York?

20:12.600 --> 20:14.887
Winston and Nolan
taking on the Big Apple?

20:15.040 --> 20:16.690
I was gonna write
the great American novel.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.561
You, you were gonna pay our rent
working on Madison Avenue

20:20.720 --> 20:24.247
selling underpants
to anyone who'd buy 'em.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.290
Yeah, I remember.

20:26.390 --> 20:29.848
But then you found Joy. Literally, so.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.566
- Yeah. Time's funny, right?
- Yeah.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.165
- Take it easy, buddy.
- See ya.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.522
- Expecting a call?
- Oh. No.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.728
Yes, well, I guess, yeah.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.201
Hell of a lot of answers
for such a simple question.

20:58.935 --> 21:00.531
Okay.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.686
Night, Mr. Mack.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.001
Good night, Walt.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.930
Hey, listen,
I'm really swamped at work here,

21:32.080 --> 21:34.606
and the only way to get through it
is if I stay late.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.762
Sorry, I'm gonna miss dinner.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.764
But I'll be home as soon as I can, okay?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.764
Yeah. No, don't wait up late.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.082
Okay.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.725
You, too.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.126
Hey, Leo.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.728
That your boy?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.984
Go get your faggy old faggot.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.446
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.329
- Wanna give me a ride?
- Yes.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.410
I got you something.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.083
- For what?
- For you.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.364
It's a prepaid phone for you.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.840
I have a phone.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.331
I thought you said it was shut off.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.364
No, it's good.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.170
I gave you my number, remember?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.491
Either way, you can use it, you know.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.723
I put my number in it, just in case.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.484
So now you can't forget.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.849
So you wanna go somewhere again?

23:28.360 --> 23:29.885
Okay.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.367
This okay?

23:44.160 --> 23:45.491
Yeah.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.603
Do you wanna suck my cock,
or what you wanna do?

23:54.440 --> 23:57.091
I'd rather just look at you.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.720
You're very nice to look at.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.530
Would that be okay?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.402
- I can sit?
- Sure.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.788
So what do you like,
you know, besides money?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.971
Hey, you said you worked at a bank.

24:22.120 --> 24:25.920
Oh, that doesn't mean I like money.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.448
I guess it sort of does, I don't know.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.524
Let me see, I like...

24:32.680 --> 24:35.081
reading, movies.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.282
I like Westerns.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.091
- Westerns?
- Yeah.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.607
When I was a kid, my dad used
to drop me off at the movies,

24:42.760 --> 24:44.967
and Westerns were my favorite.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.323
He still alive?

24:48.480 --> 24:49.925
Barely.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.969
He's in a nursing home.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.090
I take care of him.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.083
Must be close.

24:57.240 --> 25:01.450
Well, not really... unfortunately.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.369
Why do you take care of him?

25:03.560 --> 25:05.483
Because that's what
you're supposed to do.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.085
I missed you, Leo.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.684
Hey.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.241
I didn't know you'd be up.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.449
Why? It's only half past midnight.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.682
Sorry, I just had so much work
to sort through,

26:01.840 --> 26:03.444
you know, for the promotion.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.761
I just wanna be ready.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.283
I... I was just checking
on cruises here.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.930
God, there's so many different kinds.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.730
- Ah.
- And it's not that expensive,

26:12.920 --> 26:15.526
considering what you get, you know?

26:15.680 --> 26:17.364
I mean, I know it's not your thing.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.364
But it could be fun.

26:20.520 --> 26:24.570
Some of them are so ridiculous...
themes and things.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.484
And you think we'd like a cruise?

26:27.480 --> 26:28.891
Yeah.

26:29.040 --> 26:33.364
I mean, it's kind of regimented,
but it could be fun.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.249
Yeah.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.606
Yeah?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.886
I should get some sleep.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.883
Okay.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.929
I tried to call you.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.610
At the bank.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.728
Several times.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.724
Well, I got tired of working there,
so I went out to that all-night place,

26:49.920 --> 26:51.410
you know, over on Broadway?

26:51.560 --> 26:53.403
- The Sub Stop?
- Yeah, that's the place.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.927
Yeah, the one on Broadway.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.767
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Why?

27:05.240 --> 27:06.605
Okay.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.566
Good night.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.081
Good night.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.245
So, his new medication is on the table.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.767
You can give it to him
when his show goes off.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.490
Okay, thank you.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.964
Hey, it's been sitting all day.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.451
There's no carbonation.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.329
Even Nurse Mengele would approve.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.685
Here you go, Dad.

27:44.760 --> 27:45.966
Apparently, I can get
the chair for this.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.009
So let's keep it between us, okay?

28:17.240 --> 28:18.480
Shit.

28:22.640 --> 28:27.009
Ellington is considered the Super Bowl
of high-school jazz competition.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.447
There are six charts
they put out every year,

28:29.640 --> 28:31.005
new Ellington transcriptions.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.561
But more important, you're gonna
have to step it up for Ellington.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.609
You've been accepted.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.721
You made the top 5%, whatever it is.

28:41.880 --> 28:46.004
I got the word yesterday
afternoon. Now...

28:47.960 --> 28:50.035
That's a little delayed.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.690
When I was getting up to walk,

28:52.840 --> 28:54.842
I was like, "I don't believe
I'm going up here to ask

28:55.040 --> 28:57.361
Wynton Marsalis a question."

28:57.520 --> 29:00.285
And I could literally feel
my heart pounding.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.205
It was like punching through.
I could feel it pushing my shirt.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.682
I've heard people say that before,
but I never had that feeling.

29:06.840 --> 29:10.811
But when I asked him the question,
it was more so a sigh of relief.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.651
Nolan.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.365
Nolan.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.011
Nolan!

29:52.160 --> 29:54.367
- Aren't you late?
- Huh?

29:56.360 --> 29:57.930
Oh, my God.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.445
Hey, Walt.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.447
- You all right?
- Oh, I'm sorry, I overslept.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.843
Okay, well, you had
a client waiting for you.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.809
Luckily, John here covered for you.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.450
Well, I'm so sorry. Thank you.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.130
Let's try not to let this happen again?

30:32.280 --> 30:34.248
You got it. Of course.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.402
- It's not like you, anyway.
- Yeah.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.089
Hey, where were you? I waited all night.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.850
I thought you'd call.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.529
Nolan.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.728
Nolan, you know? Uh...

31:38.320 --> 31:40.368
Listen, my... my wife has dinner
with a friend tonight,

31:40.520 --> 31:43.967
and I thought maybe
I could see you, you know?

31:45.440 --> 31:48.565
We could get something to eat
or something, and, um...

31:48.760 --> 31:50.603
of course I'll pay you.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.529
If that's okay.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.170
Is that okay?

31:59.320 --> 32:01.084
Okay, then.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.607
Okay, see ya.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.006
Not bad, huh?

32:14.400 --> 32:15.561
Mm.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.609
Do you bring your wife here?

32:23.920 --> 32:26.082
Once, a long time ago.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.242
I went to a place like this back home.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.562
- You did?
- Yeah.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.127
Um...

32:37.280 --> 32:40.011
my mother took me
for one of my birthdays.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.726
It wasn't as good.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.291
It was nice.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.970
I'm sure it was.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.600
So why did you leave Dayton?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.649
I don't know.
My mother was dating another asshole.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.881
Mm.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.044
Maybe it's like what you said
about the motels, you know?

32:57.240 --> 33:00.608
It's just like I wanna be
somewhere else, you know?

33:00.760 --> 33:02.808
I don't know.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.082
Yeah.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.766
Sometimes it's nice
to be somewhere else.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.522
I'm gonna go use the facility.
I'll be right back.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.126
Okay?

33:20.440 --> 33:23.762
- Nolan? What a surprise.
- Dan. Dan.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.649
Gloria, you remember Nolan Mack,
don't you?

33:25.800 --> 33:28.121
- At the bank mixer last month.
- Hello, Nolan.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.486
Gloria, good to see you again.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.688
Must be a big occasion.
Is Joy here? I'll say hello.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.481
Oh, no, I'm here with her wife's
nephew... my wife's nephew.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.211
It's her sister's boy Leo.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.486
- Oh, must be your favorite nephew.
- Yes.

33:41.640 --> 33:43.449
Well, it was nice to see you, Nolan.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.489
You, too, Dan, Gloria.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.005
Our best to your wife.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.050
Can I come in?

34:12.159 --> 34:14.766
Another time, sure.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.603
Okay, of course.

34:31.199 --> 34:34.283
Hey, princess. Where's my money?

34:35.920 --> 34:37.445
Went out.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.681
- You went out?
- Yeah.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.049
Where the fuck you going out, huh?

34:43.199 --> 34:44.281
I just went out.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.170
Whoa, whoa, hold still, hold still.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.402
Now, listen, you know
I hate doing this, princess,

34:50.560 --> 34:52.527
but you chose this line of work.

34:52.679 --> 34:57.368
I'm gonna ask you one more time...
where's my fucking money?

34:57.520 --> 34:59.409
I don't have any... oh!

34:59.560 --> 35:01.528
Did you just fucking lie to me?

35:01.680 --> 35:03.250
Is that what just happened?

35:03.400 --> 35:05.482
- Mm-mm.
- Then where's my fucking money?

35:05.640 --> 35:08.120
I just seen you with that faggot.
So I know you got some.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.645
No, I don't. I don't.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.926
Fuck you, motherfucker...

35:11.080 --> 35:13.321
did you just fucking lie to me
twice in a row?

35:13.480 --> 35:16.086
Did you just fucking lie to me
twice in a row?!

35:16.240 --> 35:19.847
You just lied to me twice! Fuck!

35:20.000 --> 35:22.207
So you two faggots, you were just...
you were just on a date,

35:22.360 --> 35:23.805
you were just talking, hmm?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.086
You're just out on a fucking date.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.401
Motherfucker, I don't believe anything.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.967
Get the fuck up, you fucker.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.645
- What else you got?!
- Nothing!

35:30.800 --> 35:34.122
I don't fucking believe you.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.204
Now what's this? Whoo!

35:37.400 --> 35:40.244
Hey, where'd you get
this fancy-ass phone, princess?

35:40.400 --> 35:43.006
Now listen, I want my money.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.407
And I want it right fucking now!

35:45.560 --> 35:48.769
- You fucking...
- Hey! Hey!

35:48.920 --> 35:50.445
Just leave him alone!

35:52.045 --> 35:55.930
- Leave him alone!
- Oh, shit. Look who it is.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.525
Hell, let's hear what she has to say.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.445
- I'm calling the police.
- Hell, fuck, you go right ahead.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.443
I think that's a fucking great idea.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.365
I'll them how this old faggot
is paying my young whore

36:05.520 --> 36:07.488
to suck his old chicken-hawk dick.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.081
Now my new phone or yours?
Which one, hmm?

36:10.240 --> 36:12.811
Hey, what do you want?
Please, please, you...

36:12.960 --> 36:14.121
- Fuck.
- You want money?

36:14.280 --> 36:17.443
I have cash, okay?
How much to leave him alone?

36:17.600 --> 36:18.840
Now we're talking.
What, you got some money?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.810
Yeah, here, please. Here you go.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.962
This is, um...

36:24.160 --> 36:27.323
it's like $150 right there,
just take it.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.562
Take it all
and just leave him alone, okay?

36:29.720 --> 36:32.166
- Please.
- Fucking hell.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.002
Go on, pick that shit up for me.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.605
Oh, my goodness.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.450
Just please.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.681
Just leave him alone
and leave the phone.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.410
- The phone?
- Yeah.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.520
Hell, fuck.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.365
You can keep the fucking thing.
I already got my own anyway.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.682
Bitch.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.002
I mean, I'm real glad we could
sort this out like a couple of adults.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.208
It was real cool.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.203
Is violence your answer to everything?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.521
Honey, I'm sorry.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.886
Ah!

37:24.040 --> 37:26.054
Yes, it is.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.245
You fucking faggots.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.726
Oh, you're still bleeding.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.120
- There.
- Mm.

37:45.320 --> 37:48.369
All right,
we may need to go to a doctor.

37:52.720 --> 37:56.088
Hey, come on now. Shh, shh.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.480
There you go.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.007
Just let me hold it.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.525
Okay, okay.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.568
You're gonna have a black eye tomorrow.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.340
Yeah.

38:12.806 --> 38:15.122
What do you think
your wife is gonna say?

38:15.280 --> 38:17.560
Well, I don't know.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.166
Come on, lie back on the pillow, okay?

38:20.360 --> 38:21.646
- Just lie back.
- I don't wanna.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.643
Come on, come on.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.364
There you go.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.921
Keep applying pressure, okay?

38:29.080 --> 38:33.085
Let's see if there's something
to make sure you don't get infected.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.525
Doesn't look that bad.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.645
Get's worse.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.961
Really?

38:55.760 --> 38:58.525
60 years old and my first shiner.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.960
Do you have any antiseptic or peroxide?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.490
Do you...

39:35.000 --> 39:38.322
- Here you go.
- Oh, I fell asleep.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.524
It stopped bleeding.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.841
I'm gonna leave, okay?

39:48.840 --> 39:50.251
If you want.

40:26.720 --> 40:27.801
Oh, my God.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.286
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.283
My God, Nolan, what happened?

41:18.440 --> 41:19.771
Attractive, huh?

41:19.920 --> 41:21.445
What the hell happened?

41:21.600 --> 41:24.611
Oh, there was a filing cabinet,
you know, Q through S jammed,

41:24.760 --> 41:26.808
and I don't know my own strength.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.048
That has to be the worst excuse
I've ever heard,

41:29.200 --> 41:30.884
and I'm in a position
to hear a lot of them.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.168
Did the dog eat your homework as well?

41:33.320 --> 41:34.446
I can't fool you, can I?

41:34.600 --> 41:36.568
No, you can't. So what happened?

41:36.760 --> 41:39.081
What, were you out fighting crime
in your secret life?

41:39.240 --> 41:41.322
There it is.

41:41.480 --> 41:42.570
You figured it out.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.049
Oh, I forgot.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.682
Is Patty hiring anybody, you know,
right now at the restaurant?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.171
You know, there's a thing
called the segue.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.489
It gets you from one topic
to the next one.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.687
Look into it.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.320
Well, listen,
it's for a relative of a friend.

41:58.480 --> 42:01.962
You know, the kid needs a break.
I'm just trying to help somebody out.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.162
Yeah, I... I can ask, I guess.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.971
I should have some sway
with the management here, I assume.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.770
Thank you.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.204
Yeah, you sure you're okay?

42:14.360 --> 42:17.011
Yeah, of course.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.686
- All right.
- I'm great.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.970
So they're calling him the new Updike.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.804
I don't get it, he's too sentimental.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.325
Sometimes, I guess.

42:26.520 --> 42:31.003
No, he is. What he gets
ultimately just seems faked.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.891
Or as Winston would say, like horseshit.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.691
Where is that man when we need him, hmm?

42:39.760 --> 42:41.171
What?

42:44.280 --> 42:45.361
You should be teaching.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.841
I do teach. Three nights a week.

42:48.040 --> 42:51.726
Yeah, well, the university...
you know what I'm saying.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.845
A filing cabinet? Seriously?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.606
It was just a stupid accident.

43:02.320 --> 43:05.722
Well... for now...

43:05.880 --> 43:09.043
English as a second language
three nights a week is plenty for me.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.168
Believe me, I don't miss the politics.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.210
- Do you want something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.402
How was your dinner last night with Cat?

43:16.560 --> 43:17.607
Well, you know Cat.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.524
We just talked about that ESL conference

43:19.680 --> 43:21.967
we have to spend the whole weekend at.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.731
We tried to go to that sub shop
on Broadway, but it's closed.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.450
Did you know that?

44:01.440 --> 44:02.680
Hey.

44:06.520 --> 44:08.249
"Masculin Féminin."

44:12.480 --> 44:14.808
The Children of Marx and Coca-Cola.

44:15.238 --> 44:16.911
Certainement.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.330
Remember it?

44:21.480 --> 44:22.970
Of course I do.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.887
Winter of 1977.

44:28.040 --> 44:31.203
We saw it at the Fine Arts.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.169
You, in your exquisite way,

44:33.320 --> 44:37.120
you explained the entire movie
to me scene by scene.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.004
I'm sure the rest of the people
in the café loved that,

44:39.160 --> 44:41.640
but it was kind of wonderful.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.686
The restaurant?

44:57.880 --> 45:00.565
Sub Stop?

45:05.200 --> 45:06.725
I'm sorry I lied about it.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.849
I know.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.409
You always watch this.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.610
Because it's you.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.280
Hey.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.886
Hey.

45:50.040 --> 45:53.601
That friend of yours who manages
the restaurant, she called me.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.967
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she's gonna try me out.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.442
Just she says I need a white shirt
and black pants.

45:59.600 --> 46:04.083
I have black jeans, but I think
she means a button-up shirt.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.282
Oh, I'm sure she does.

46:06.440 --> 46:07.885
Tell you what, when I get out today,

46:08.040 --> 46:11.362
I'll come get you
and we'll get you some.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.045
O-okay.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.043
Okay.

46:15.200 --> 46:18.124
Bye.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.969
Well, I guess I should go.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.963
No, that... that's okay.

46:48.120 --> 46:49.724
No, we have our rules.

47:00.640 --> 47:01.880
See ya.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.209
So how come we don't do more?

47:07.360 --> 47:10.443
Oh, we do enough. This...

47:10.640 --> 47:13.769
No, you know, I mean, like, sex.

47:15.840 --> 47:20.004
I don't know.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.289
Is it because you have a wife?

47:23.480 --> 47:26.086
Maybe.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.964
This isn't cheating?

47:31.360 --> 47:32.771
Yeah, it probably is.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.364
I should get going.

47:39.520 --> 47:42.046
Wait, um...

47:42.200 --> 47:44.726
Here, I... I got you something.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.645
It's no big deal.

47:47.840 --> 47:51.890
I just found it, you know,
over by the video store.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.047
- A Western.
- Yeah.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.202
- You found it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

47:58.360 --> 48:01.569
You know, it's for you.
They only had VHS, so...

48:01.720 --> 48:02.926
No, that's all right.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.731
I'm sure I have a machine
somewhere that can play this.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.723
Oh, thank you, Leo.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.325
- It's good.
- Yeah.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.291
It is, it's...

48:19.600 --> 48:21.409
Okay, then.

48:21.560 --> 48:22.846
Thanks.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.681
- Hey.
- Hi, Nolan.

48:48.840 --> 48:51.580
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, good to see you.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.671
- Hey.
- Is the madman around?

48:55.084 --> 48:58.451
Yeah. No, he's, um... no, he's...

48:58.600 --> 49:01.410
look, Nolan, I'm sorry,
but that young man,

49:01.560 --> 49:03.449
your friend's son,
he didn't show up today.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.329
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:05.480 --> 49:07.608
Well, yeah, you know how busy
it gets there at lunch,

49:07.760 --> 49:09.569
and one of my guys was out,
so it really put me

49:09.720 --> 49:12.451
in this tough situation because,
you know, I was depending on him.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.090
I'm so sorry, it won't happen again.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.527
I'll call him right away,
you know, and...

49:16.720 --> 49:18.484
No, don't worry about that.
It's all right.

49:18.680 --> 49:21.411
You know, I gave him a chance,
and I got to do what's best there.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.604
You know? It's my job, so...

49:24.760 --> 49:25.921
I'm sure that you understand, Nolan.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.287
Please, of course. You know, I'm sorry.

49:28.480 --> 49:30.323
- Yeah.
- You gave him a shot.

49:30.480 --> 49:32.323
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.687
Yeah, I'm sorry, too, Nolan.

49:34.840 --> 49:37.047
- All right, I'll see you.
- See you.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.009
Who is it?

49:46.160 --> 49:47.650
Me.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.131
Who?

49:49.280 --> 49:51.123
Nolan!

49:51.280 --> 49:53.931
I can't right now.
You need to come back.

49:54.080 --> 49:55.969
I need to talk to you, Leo.

49:56.120 --> 49:57.485
I can't right now.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.251
No, I'd really like to talk.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.324
What are you doing?
We can talk about this later.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.522
Aren't you supposed to be somewhere?

50:10.680 --> 50:11.727
Wh... what?

50:11.880 --> 50:14.486
The restaurant?
My friend, she gave you a job.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.881
She wasn't particularly happy
about you not showing up.

50:17.040 --> 50:19.805
Shit, I forgot.
Look, we'll talk about this later, okay?

50:19.960 --> 50:21.291
No.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.771
We're gonna talk about it now.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.048
- What are you doing?
- I went out on a limb for you.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.590
That was my best friend's
girlfriend and...

50:27.840 --> 50:29.241
What the hell is this?

50:29.400 --> 50:30.765
Look, man, I don't want no problems.

50:30.960 --> 50:32.883
Listen, you need to go.
You have no right to be here.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.203
Right, huh? Really?
What gives him the right to be here?

50:36.360 --> 50:37.964
What? Is he paying you, too?

50:38.120 --> 50:41.130
Okay, you gotta go, like, right now
or I'm fucking calling the police, okay?

50:41.280 --> 50:42.611
Now you're calling the police, huh?

50:42.760 --> 50:43.886
Yeah, I am. Now get out of my house.

50:44.040 --> 50:47.044
House? What kind of house is this?

50:47.200 --> 50:49.043
It's a dump. It's a cesspool.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.567
Then get out of it!

50:51.720 --> 50:53.051
Okay, listen, I'm sorry, okay?

50:53.200 --> 50:54.531
- I didn't mean that.
- No.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.251
I'm just saying you don't need
to have these people in your life.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.243
- No!
- You don't need to be doing this.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.243
- No! Get the fuck out of my house!
- Okay!

51:01.400 --> 51:04.131
I got it! I'm sorry! All right.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.884
I'm sorry, all right?

51:06.080 --> 51:08.321
Listen, I'm just trying to help you.
I don't...

51:32.240 --> 51:33.571
Here. Then, are the categories.

51:33.720 --> 51:38.760
They are Fast Forward Politics
followed by It's All Relative,

51:38.920 --> 51:41.605
South America, and Famous Lovers.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.922
Famous Lovers for 1,000, Brad.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.327
All right, spoken like a true teacher.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.528
One of TV's most unusual romances

51:48.680 --> 51:50.842
involved two characters
from "The Muppet Show,"

51:51.040 --> 51:53.281
one is a pretty porker named Miss Piggy.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.125
For $1,000, name her amorous amphibian.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.931
- I need to talk to you.
- Kermit the Frog.

51:59.080 --> 52:01.686
You're right, and you have $1,000.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.002
I need to talk to you
about something, Dad, okay?

52:07.640 --> 52:09.802
And I need you to listen

52:09.960 --> 52:12.281
'cause I know somewhere in there,
you can hear me.

52:14.120 --> 52:16.327
I wanna talk about
that time we went to the beach.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.881
Summer of 1965, I think it was.

52:23.520 --> 52:25.488
We checked into this little motel.

52:27.080 --> 52:29.242
12 years old.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.971
You, me and Mom.

52:32.120 --> 52:35.602
If you had any idea
what a journey that was.

52:35.760 --> 52:39.207
Still sticks with me to this day.

52:39.360 --> 52:40.566
Ridiculous.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.689
Something happened that summer, Dad.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.482
At first, I couldn't figure it out.
I didn't want to.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.531
But I knew.

53:00.920 --> 53:03.844
I knew that all the wishing
and praying in the world

53:04.000 --> 53:06.401
couldn't change the fact that I was gay.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.444
I didn't do anything about it.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.444
I didn't tell you...

53:15.600 --> 53:17.967
or Mom or anyone.

53:20.360 --> 53:21.964
It was my secret.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.526
And suddenly I'm 60 years old.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.010
It's like I'm still there,
like nothing happened.

53:33.240 --> 53:37.643
Like I'm still waiting for something
I felt was promised to me that day,

53:37.800 --> 53:42.362
something that never came,
and I'm angry about it.

53:44.880 --> 53:48.248
And I'm still sitting on that beach,
and I'm still 12 years old,

53:48.400 --> 53:51.802
and nothing's changed,
and I'm still sorry about it.

54:05.360 --> 54:08.807
That was some summer, huh, Dad?

54:37.960 --> 54:39.405
Okay.

55:07.640 --> 55:08.880
Hey, you.

55:12.120 --> 55:15.681
I was just checking on you.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.446
Go back to sleep, okay?

55:18.600 --> 55:20.568
Stay here, please.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.161
Hey, I was thinking.

55:34.320 --> 55:37.164
I was thinking about the cruise,
you know?

55:37.320 --> 55:41.041
And I was wondering
what month do you think

55:41.200 --> 55:42.486
would be good for us?

55:45.160 --> 55:47.766
Do we really wanna go on a cruise?

55:47.920 --> 55:49.604
Yeah, I thought...

55:49.760 --> 55:53.367
Hey, we'll talk about it.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.010
Nolan...

55:55.200 --> 55:58.443
stay here with me tonight.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.728
Please?

56:00.880 --> 56:03.360
Just for tonight.

56:03.520 --> 56:04.601
- Okay.
- Okay?

56:04.760 --> 56:06.000
Yeah.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.246
Who is it?

56:35.880 --> 56:37.086
What do you mean?

56:43.600 --> 56:45.443
It's just someone I talk to.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.602
You could talk to me.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.411
I know.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.922
We have separate beds,

56:58.080 --> 57:00.242
separate lives, separate rooms.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.481
I don't know how much more
separate we could be.

57:07.680 --> 57:09.444
I should go wash up.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.806
No.

57:11.880 --> 57:14.247
No.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.765
Don't leave.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.364
I love you, Nolan.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.124
I love you, too.

57:51.840 --> 57:53.126
Joy?

57:57.240 --> 57:58.765
Joy?

57:59.800 --> 58:01.643
Hey, Joy?

58:03.000 --> 58:04.490
Joy?

58:04.640 --> 58:06.005
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:06.160 --> 58:07.241
Where are you going?

58:07.400 --> 58:10.210
The ESL conference, remember?
Cat, of course, is an hour early.

58:10.360 --> 58:11.850
As always.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.020
Early bird gets
the free donuts and coffee.

58:14.120 --> 58:17.211
- Hey, Nolan, long time, no see.
- Hey, Cat. Good to see you.

58:17.360 --> 58:19.727
And thanks for letting me
borrow your wife here.

58:19.880 --> 58:22.121
I put the number
where we're gonna be right there,

58:22.280 --> 58:23.520
so call if you need me.

58:23.680 --> 58:24.841
Otherwise, we're good to go.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.190
Same place? Savannah Stud Farm?

58:27.442 --> 58:30.801
You told him. Bye-bye, Nolan.
I'll be outside.

58:30.960 --> 58:34.009
Okay. So call me if you wanna talk.

58:34.160 --> 58:35.844
We'll be back Sunday afternoon.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.047
Uh-huh.

58:37.240 --> 58:41.529
Oh, and, uh, the cruise sent a DVD.

58:41.680 --> 58:44.650
If you wanna take a look at it,
I put it by the TV.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.451
- Of course.
- Okay.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.806
Bye, Nolan.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.924
See you.

59:42.080 --> 59:46.608
...celebrate life the Old World
Mediterranean way.

59:46.760 --> 59:49.525
Spend your days visiting
the ancient islands,

59:49.680 --> 59:51.921
walking around the white sands,

59:52.080 --> 59:54.970
or shopping at local markets.

59:55.120 --> 59:57.885
You can simply lounge
on one of our seven decks,

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.487
three swimming pools...

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.202
Nolan, what the hell?

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.124
God, you're kidding. Our lunch?

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.964
I'm so sorry.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.043
Beaumont's got me prepping
for this promotion,

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.361
and I've been all over the place.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.329
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.289
Sorry, so... but what's happening?

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.805
'Cause I can't tell, you know.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.769
I mean, you had the black eye
that you didn't want to discuss.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.207
You asked me to get a job
for a friend of a relative

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.890
and he never shows up.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.008
Can we... can we go for a walk
or something?

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.049
There's too many people
doing math around here.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.004
Of course, but everything's fine, okay?

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.328
Everything is fine.
It's just two guys talking.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.802
I mean, I bank here,
so you'd be chatting with a client.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.803
Just two guys taking a walk, right?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.401
I mean, I do my banking, so...

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.850
Taking a walk with a longtime customer.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.048
Yeah, you got it, of course.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.684
Hmm.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.245
Just give me a moment, okay?

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.686
Yeah.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.170
- What are you doing here?
- I need help, okay?

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.687
- What's wrong?
- I had to come here.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.003
To my work? No. No, we can't talk here.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.640
We have to go outside. Come on.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.929
We really need to go outside.
Can we do that?

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.445
All right, yeah.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.965
Hey, Walt, we're just talking.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.969
- You okay, Mr. Nolan?
- I'm good.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.724
What is it that you want? Money?
Is that what this is all about?

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.001
He knows you work at a bank.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.050
I work here, I don't own it.
The kid's an idiot.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.486
Look, if... if I don't get the money,
he said he'll kill me.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.290
- That's good to know.
- What are you doing?

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.680
Calling the police,
that's what I'm doing.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.887
Why?

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.804
Because threatening someone's life
is against the law.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.008
- No, you can't just call the police.
- Why the hell not?

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.049
Because you can't.
Look, if you're not gonna help me,

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.247
okay, I'm just gonna go.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.925
- No, no, wait.
- I'm just gonna go.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.889
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.088
Can't believe I'm saying this. How much?

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.241
$3,200.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.726
$3,200? Are you kidding me?

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.081
Do you know how much money that is?
Does he think I'm made of money?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.521
Look, like I said, if you're not
gonna help me, then I'm just gonna go.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.806
- No, no, wait, wait.
- Okay, I'm just...

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.405
is he here?
Is that what this is all about?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.040
- Is he here with you?
- Yeah, I'm right fucking here.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.248
You got trouble with the ATM machine?

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.323
All you gotta do is hit it
and the cash comes out.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.561
Just stay right there. Stay right there.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.563
- No, no, don't come any closer.
- Look, he's gonna...

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.846
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.923
How many times I gotta tell you?
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.249
You know, you really know how
to overcomplicate things, you know that?

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.483
Listen, you see those people?
We can't do this here, all right?

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.331
- You have to leave now, okay?
- Oh, I don't think so, man.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.603
See, I just came to do some banking.
So I don't see any problem in there.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.761
You know, it's the bank,

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.127
and that's what I'm here to do,
some banking.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.648
I'm not giving you a goddamn cent,
do you understand that?

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.691
Get the fuck off!

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.080
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.203
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Motherfucker!

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.630
Get the fuck off of him! Fuck!

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.125
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Let's go.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.523
Fuck you! Are you kidding me right now?

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.011
I'm gonna knock your ass out.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.208
I'm gonna knock your ass out,
motherfucker.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.011
He's the one who started it!
He assaulted me!

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.208
He was just trying to help, okay?

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.486
Lovers' quarrel!

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.444
You two bitches try to put it on me!

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.324
- No, he's the one.
- Motherfucker.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.646
- No, no, no.
- You faggot.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.041
He's the one, he attacked.
He was just... he was helping.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.247
He's all right. He's okay.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.410
I'll be seeing you soon, princess!
No doubt about it.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.325
I'll be seeing you real soon
with your retard strength and all!

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.801
This ain't over! I promise!

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.405
Nobody goes anywhere.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.608
Come on, people, please, party's over.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.685
You all right, Mr. Mack?

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.365
I'm fine, Walt. I'm okay. Thanks.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.807
Okay. Let's go back inside.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.525
Come on, party's over.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.490
Back inside.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.846
Winston.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.764
It's all over.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.285
This is Leo.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.521
Hey.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.045
I figured you might be hungry.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.044
Thank you.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.044
Maybe I should open a diner.
You can come work for me.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.649
The way things are going at the bank,
it's not the worst idea.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.531
Ever think about
going back to school, you know?

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.489
Do you have any plans besides...

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.928
I wasn't really good at school.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.890
Well, maybe you'll
be good at it this time.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.646
You know, things change.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.643
I don't have the money for it anyway.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.565
Well, maybe I could help you.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.245
Why?

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.289
I don't know. Because I'd like to.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.768
If you finish that,
would you like another one?

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.246
Sure.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.844
Great.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.763
So you sent for big brother.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.443
Why don't I remind myself to pack a gun

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.846
when I visit my neighbor?

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.967
That baby's gonna need a name. Yours.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.041
Well, come on, pull the trigger.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.686
First you shoot me,
then you gotta shoot Huey

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.205
because he saw you...

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.880
Hey.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.523
You got tired of the TV?

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.360
Yeah.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.566
Come here.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.531
Give me your hand.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.008
It's okay. Please?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.646
Come here.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.171
Give me your hand.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.486
It's okay.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.131
Oh, no, no, no, please.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.004
No, no, please.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.367
It's okay. Just this.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.046
Just this. Okay?

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.045
Look, what is it you want?

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.084
'Cause I don't like this.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.290
I know.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.249
I'll pay you.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.528
No, please, I just...

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.961
I... I don't like this, okay?

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.771
We're here for sex.
That's what we're here for.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.570
That's what I'm here for.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.926
I don't understand.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.889
You'll have sex with me,
but you won't let me hold you?

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.644
That's how it goes.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.211
Doesn't make sense.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.746
It's just how... it's how it goes, okay?

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:21.408
No, no.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.609
Please, please, please, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.207
I'm sorry. Look, you know what?

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.362
- I'm just gonna go.
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.045
Wait, I'll pay you. Okay, how much?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.600
- No, it isn't that, I just need to go.
- No, no, wait, please.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.125
It's okay.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.009
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:42.805
I'm sorry.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.444
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.804
It just can't be nothing, you know?

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.962
It can't.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:57.642
Because you're here for a reason.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.962
You came here for a reason.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.009
You're in my goddamn life for a reason.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.167
- No!
- No?! You...

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:07.642
you gave me that videotape.
You told me about your mother.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.245
About leaving?

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.169
That can't be nothing, Leo.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:20.450
Look at me. Please just look at me.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:24.090
It can't be nothing.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.848
It can be. All right? It can be.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.850
'Cause it's nothing.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.849
'Cause it means nothing.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.720
Nolan?

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.847
Nolan, are you here?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.570
Nolan?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.041
Nolan, are you here?

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.362
Oh, fuck.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.407
- Nolan?
- Hey.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.925
Hey, you're back.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.525
Yeah, the front door was unlocked.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.921
Oh, I didn't know.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.484
Hey, I didn't hear you. You're early.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.688
Is there a reason
why the front door's open?

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.844
No, I must have left it.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.651
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I've been in the car for two hours.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.847
Of course.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.402
You know, I watched the DVD,
you know, of the... of the cruise?

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.130
We should watch it together.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.251
Sure. I'll be right out.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.406
- All set for tomorrow night?
- Mm.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.040
Did my secretary get you
Blydon's address, all the details?

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.248
- Yes, she did.
- Good.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.562
Blydon doesn't do this
for everyone, Nolan.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.643
I know, and I'm very grateful.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.962
- Are you?
- Excuse me?

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.125
Listen, I don't know what went on
in that parking lot or what's up.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.449
All I do know
is I stuck out my neck for you

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.763
in a big goddamn way.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.491
Don't make me look like an asshole.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.007
And don't you fuck this up.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.286
Of course.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.726
Okay, then.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.560
What?

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.051
- A single Windsor?
- Yeah.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.681
A little short on time here.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.207
- You just hold still.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.684
I remember you did this
on our wedding day.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.207
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.090
I was so nervous,
I couldn't even move my hands.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.686
- Okay?
- Yep.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.564
- That looks good.
- Thanks.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.762
All right, you got your coat?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.365
Yeah.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.041
Thanks.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.701
Okay.

01:12:58.197 --> 01:13:02.962
- You look wonderful.
- So do you. Mm.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.407
We should get going, you know?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.608
You know how traffic is gonna be.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.888
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.482
Oh, come on.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.721
Hello?

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.922
What?

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.849
- When?
- What's wrong?

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.448
Okay. Where?

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.646
Okay, I know where that is.
I'll be right there.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.002
What is it, Nolan? Is it your father?

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.085
Look, Joy, I'm gonna
have to meet you there, okay?

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.242
Listen, um...

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.006
here's the address to Blydon's house.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.083
I'm sorry, but I'll be there
as soon as I can.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.368
Something has happened,
and I really need to go.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.086
Are you kidding me?
I... I don't even know these people.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.890
No, no, Joy, please, you know Beaumont.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.690
- Please, you gotta go for me, okay?
- For God's sake...

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.081
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- For God's sake, Nolan.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.611
- I promise, Joy.
- Nolan...

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.806
I'll be right there.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.126
Excuse me, I got a call about
a young man picked up downtown?

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.643
First name Leo.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.121
They found him in the street.
It was an overdose.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.805
No wallet, no ID.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.371
How did you know to call me?

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.562
He had a phone.
You were the only number in it.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.802
- He should be in there, 235.
- Thank you.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.324
Excuse me, excuse me.
There's no one in there.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.928
Must have walked out on his own.
It's not unusual in cases like this.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.281
Let me check with the front desk.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.886
What was your relationship
to the patient again?

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.725
Nothing.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.370
I'm sure it's his father.
He's been very sick.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.446
Was it your father?

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.840
No.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.921
'Cause that was the only excuse
I was gonna accept,

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.367
if he was dying in your arms.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.851
Maybe then...

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.369
- We need to talk.
- I don't wanna talk.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.249
- We have to.
- Well, I don't want to.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.088
Are you going to be with him?

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.048
I don't even know where he is.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.644
Why?

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.529
Because I can't lie anymore.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.045
No more lies.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.531
You can't do this.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.920
Joy.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.320
Is he better than me?

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.766
It's not that. Of course not.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.160
Then what?

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.321
Joy...

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.482
You wanted to talk, so you're
gonna give me a goddamn answer.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.967
- I just did.
- No, that wasn't good enough.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.963
What does he do for you that I don't?

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.167
It's not that.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.845
Well, then what is it?!

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.526
Because I need to know.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.648
Does he clean your clothes for you?

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.088
Does he listen to your stories,
your boring fucking stories?!

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.282
'Cause I don't think he does.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.204
Does he tell you that everything's
okay even when it isn't?

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.805
Because I am sure

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.166
- he doesn't do that.
- Joy...

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.765
Did he put up with your father's demands

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.049
till they piled up on him
and clogged his whole goddamn life,

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.281
my whole goddamn life?

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.761
Oh, my God, Nolan, the arrogance of you.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.961
You're right.
Everything you're saying...

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.010
- Don't goddamn accommodate me!
- I'm sorry! You're right.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.490
So...

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.324
so now what?

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.927
So... so what?
This is... this is it now?

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.604
I don't know what to say.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.281
What are you gonna do without me?

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.561
Huh?

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.563
I wanna know what you're
gonna do without me.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.609
- Joy...
- What are you gonna do without me?

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.091
How are you gonna make it?

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.811
- Please, you don't need to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.764
No, please, we can make it work.
We've always made it...

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.564
- It's never worked, okay?
- How can you say that?

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.960
Because it hasn't.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.811
Never.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.166
I'm sorry, it's just...
it's not what I wanted.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.085
Then what is it that you want?
Please, you won't even try.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.890
Try?

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.804
What do you think
I've been doing all these years?

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.123
Going to that job
day after day, form after form,

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.408
all to keep up this ridiculous pretense.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.607
Is that what I am to you?

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.888
- A ridiculous pretense?!
- No, you're not!

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.122
No, you're not.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.766
It's just over.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.611
No.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.125
My God...

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.890
I love you, Joy.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.526
That was never a lie.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.047
It's just time for us
to be in the real world.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.363
What if I don't wanna be
in the real world?

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.045
Well, I do.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.880
Well, I don't.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.089
That's why I married you.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.809
- Mm-hmm.
- Jesus.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.361
- Yeah.
- Cripes.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.409
What about your father?

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.766
I'll still visit.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.649
Some things remain, you know.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.529
I don't know.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.967
Nothing turned out the way
I thought, I guess.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.202
I... I wouldn't know how that feels.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.691
Remember the book I was gonna write...

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.882
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and the play, the other play?

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.121
Mm-hmm.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.123
You know, life can be funny like that.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.282
You don't have
to explain anything to me.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.650
I mean, Joy's a great woman,
you're my best friend, and...

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.848
you know what I tell my students?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.163
Every day, blank page...
just fill it up,

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.522
and you get somewhere.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.048
Or something... like that.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.004
Hey, there she is.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.247
Uh, you know what?

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.801
I'll write to you from New York,
unless they have Wi-Fi there.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.530
- Do you think they have Wi-Fi?
- Oh, maybe.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.967
Then I'll email you.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.690
Thank you.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.569
It's just two friends talking,
all right?

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.371
- Yeah.
- Hey, maybe...

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.601
maybe it's never too late

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.041
to finally start living
the life you really want.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.849
- Maybe that's the deal.
- Yeah.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.287
Or maybe that's a bunch of bullshit.
I don't know.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.010
You email me about it.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.650
- I will.
- All right?

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.040
All right. See you, Nolan. Take care.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.725
See you, Patty. You, too.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.681
Goodbye, Walt.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.320
Good luck, Mr. Mack.
You will be missed around here.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.811
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.203
I drove down a street one night.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.969
A street I didn't know.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.448
It's the way your life goes sometimes.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.604
You drive down this one...

01:22:56.066 --> 01:22:57.853
then another.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.720
And now...

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.765
another.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.280
<i>Can't stand in the way</i>

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.808
<i>Of another day not promised</i>

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.202
<i>I've thought this thing through</i>

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.601
<i>And it's all I can do</i>

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.046
<i>For anyone</i>

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.810
<i>I'm going</i>

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.850
<i>Going</i>

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.648
<i>And time can be cruel</i>

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:19.521
<i>It's the things that we do
that will break us</i>

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.562
<i>But unless it's a pill</i>

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.566
<i>I'll pass it on if you will allow me</i>

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.767
<i>I'm going</i>

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.241
<i>Going</i>

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.686
<i>I've known</i>

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.848
<i>For a long time</i>

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.444
<i>But you were mine</i>

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.570
<i>All mine</i>

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.730
<i>All, all mine</i>

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.009
<i>You can't wish your days away</i>

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.811
<i>Or they'll all come true</i>

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.843
<i>It's a feeling I had today</i>

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.130
<i>I love you</i>

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:57.491
<i>But I just can't stay...</i>

01:25:58.305 --> 01:26:04.385
