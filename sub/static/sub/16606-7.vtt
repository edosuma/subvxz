00:16.358 --> 00:18.273
I'm about to stunt on your ass.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.453
♪ You not even ready for this shit! ♪

00:22.633 --> 00:25.507
Ooh, you look like a mermaid with feet.

00:25.532 --> 00:27.732
- In a good way, though.
- I love it.

00:27.757 --> 00:30.326
But do you love it like, "I would
give her money for her fundraiser,"

00:30.351 --> 00:33.655
or, "This bitch looking
like a black Ariel"?

00:33.680 --> 00:36.584
- Are those mutually exclusive?
- Okay.

00:36.609 --> 00:38.625
You really going all-out
for this fundraiser, huh?

00:38.650 --> 00:40.796
Hell, yeah, girl. I wanna kill it.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.651
And I wanna do right by the kids,

00:42.676 --> 00:44.453
and all our friends are gonna be there.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.811
Plus, after everything that's happened,

00:45.836 --> 00:48.090
I realize I had it all wrong.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.883
You know, I don't need
to be Miss No Fucks.

00:50.908 --> 00:53.562
I'm now Miss Give All the Fucks.

00:53.587 --> 00:57.148
Oh, okay. So, what does Miss Give All
the Fucks give all the fucks about?

00:57.367 --> 00:59.712
Uh, my man.

00:59.737 --> 01:02.921
Um, my job. Of course me.

01:02.946 --> 01:05.289
Okay, I'm just done doing dumb shit

01:05.313 --> 01:08.093
and, really,

01:08.869 --> 01:11.281
I think I like who I'm becoming.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.353
- That's backwards.
- No, it's not.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.406
You got titties on your back now?

01:21.359 --> 01:23.459
Uh, so, anyway, girl, how you doing?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.553
How you holding up with,
you know, everything?

01:25.578 --> 01:29.578
Yeah, I'm, pssh... girl, you know.

01:29.687 --> 01:32.171
Are you gonna come back out and
show me some more clothes or what?

01:35.729 --> 01:37.763
- Tsk, I know.
- Okay.

02:06.036 --> 02:07.569
Morning.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.661
Morning.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.659
Are you ready for your big day?

02:13.859 --> 02:15.331
Yeah.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.323
Your interview's gonna go great.

02:21.977 --> 02:25.011
I just... I just really
want it, you know?

02:31.624 --> 02:33.085
Mm.

02:33.464 --> 02:34.930
What are you doing?

02:34.955 --> 02:38.023
I can't have my man going
in there all stressed out.

02:40.148 --> 02:42.638
Come on, you're gonna
make me late, girl.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.718
- Like I need much time.
- Oh, so you got it like that?

02:48.862 --> 02:50.656
Yeah, you got it like that.

02:53.707 --> 02:57.026
I'm telling you someone is stealing
food out of the break room refrigerator.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.612
I know! I spent all weekend making
a three-bean chili for nothing.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.348
- I hope they like it.
- Oh, no!

03:04.451 --> 03:06.485
- Hey. Crystal?
- Molly?!

03:06.510 --> 03:08.487
You guys keep going. I'll catch up.

03:08.512 --> 03:10.756
- Girl!
- Hey!

03:11.228 --> 03:13.325
- Girl, how you doing?
- I'm good!

03:13.350 --> 03:15.204
I've just been kind of
keeping it low-key lately.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.484
Oh, my God, I was just at No
Vacancy and I thought about you.

03:18.509 --> 03:20.632
Remember that time you threw
that drink in that guy's face

03:20.657 --> 03:22.334
'cause he said you were drunk?

03:22.359 --> 03:25.752
- You were so drunk!
- Girl, please, I was doing too much.

03:25.777 --> 03:27.839
The most! But now look at you.

03:27.864 --> 03:30.142
You looking all classy
and effervescent and shit.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.221
Thank you! You know,
I've been feeling great.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.439
- I started seeing a therapist...
- Therapy?

03:35.713 --> 03:37.555
- Girl, you okay?
- Yes, girl!

03:37.580 --> 03:39.728
I just had some things in
my life that I needed to fix.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.964
I mean, don't feel like you have
to share it with me. It's okay.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.333
No, it's fine, girl. Therapy's
helped me with that, too.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.569
Girl, you know I was out
there being a hot-ass mess.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.405
Even thinking about how
I wasn't valuing myself.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.896
Girl, I had to change something.

03:51.216 --> 03:53.908
And now I just feel so centered.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.336
Oh. Okay.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.805
Anyway, let's get together for...

03:59.830 --> 04:02.107
So, our vision is to
integrate mobile commerce

04:02.132 --> 04:04.810
in a revolutionary way within
the messaging environment.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.145
We are still solving for that.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.847
What work have you done in that field?

04:08.872 --> 04:10.182
Tons, actually.

04:10.207 --> 04:11.576
You know, what I'm most interested in

04:11.601 --> 04:13.696
is weaving together
users' current behaviors

04:13.721 --> 04:15.864
instead of building
yet another destination.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.451
Sure, we're into that, but
what would your approach be?

04:18.552 --> 04:20.702
Well, you want as many
users as possible, right?

04:20.728 --> 04:22.186
Of course.

04:22.211 --> 04:24.059
You know, I'm coming into this cold.

04:24.084 --> 04:26.408
- I don't wanna step on anybody's toes.
- No, step. Go ahead.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.020
They're my toes. I don't care.

04:28.045 --> 04:32.802
Okay. Well, um, the Meridian
app is amazing, obviously.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.374
So is Instagram. So is Messenger.

04:35.615 --> 04:39.221
Okay, Cameron, you talked about
replicating the best apps and features,

04:39.246 --> 04:40.489
so why not deploy a daemon?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.379
Let those companies do
all the work for you,

04:42.404 --> 04:44.727
and you get to own all of
the data, all of the users,

04:44.752 --> 04:47.074
and the skeleton key
that ties them together.

04:47.699 --> 04:49.265
This is so crazy!

04:49.290 --> 04:52.268
I still can't believe they just
offered you a job on the spot!

04:52.293 --> 04:55.045
Yeah! Yo, I knew the interview
was going great, but I didn't think

04:55.070 --> 04:57.219
they were gonna do that.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.050
Oh, how are the perks, though?

05:01.075 --> 05:04.079
Free parking space, tons of T-shirts...

05:04.104 --> 05:06.415
I mean, they're all
XXXL, but still free...

05:06.440 --> 05:09.018
and a company credit card, I think.

05:09.043 --> 05:12.921
What? Oh, we 'bout to be charging
up a tab at stupid places!

05:12.946 --> 05:16.158
Okay, sushi every night,
and not California rolls.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.984
I'm talking monkfish.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.287
No, I am so pumped for you.

05:22.466 --> 05:24.199
You earned that shit.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.122
Thanks, babe.

05:26.216 --> 05:28.470
Oh, and Meridian is a good company, too.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.729
I mean, they do a few
things backwards, but...

05:30.831 --> 05:34.166
Well, that's why they got
you, though, to fix they shit.

05:34.191 --> 05:35.667
Yeah.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.277
Yo, it just made me think about
what I was doing with my app.

05:38.302 --> 05:40.927
I mean, I'm way more ahead
in developing than they are,

05:40.952 --> 05:42.708
and they're an actual company.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.536
Okay.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.918
And so, what does that mean?

05:46.943 --> 05:49.291
That maybe I shouldn't take this job.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.661
I should get Woot-Woot
off the ground instead.

05:52.463 --> 05:53.796
Wait, what?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.998
Yo, look, all right,
I know it sounds crazy,

05:56.023 --> 05:58.300
but the fact that I was way
ahead two or three years ago

05:58.325 --> 05:59.935
means I know what I'm doing.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.739
Like, I'm just mad inspired right now.

06:07.668 --> 06:11.829
Hey, look. I know you wanna
get your thing off the ground,

06:12.251 --> 06:15.184
but this is way too
good a job to pass up.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.542
And... and you've been wanting this.

06:19.213 --> 06:22.180
Do we really wanna go
back to how things were?

06:25.682 --> 06:27.315
You right, you right.

06:27.340 --> 06:29.732
And you can work on
Woot-Woot at night, you know?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.990
You're gonna make it happen.

06:32.015 --> 06:33.921
You know I believe in you.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.460
I know.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.067
Oh, hey, you know the good thing

06:42.092 --> 06:44.887
about all those extra,
extra, extra large T-shirts?

06:44.912 --> 06:46.981
We can get fat as fuck!

06:47.006 --> 06:50.192
We definitely need new fat shirts.

06:51.989 --> 06:53.422
Hey, babe, you gonna help me finish?

06:53.447 --> 06:55.046
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Thank you.

07:04.070 --> 07:06.838
Higher. Higher.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.429
Lower.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.961
Higher.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.607
And make sure it's stable.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.954
Insurance won't cover us
if we damage the property.

07:13.979 --> 07:15.411
Okay?

07:15.436 --> 07:17.646
I drive past this neighborhood every day

07:17.671 --> 07:20.349
and I didn't know homes
like this existed up here.

07:20.374 --> 07:23.039
I know. It's so pretty.

07:23.064 --> 07:24.920
Yeah, what's this neighborhood
technically called, Issa?

07:24.945 --> 07:28.557
Oh, someone told me it's
the black Beverly Hills.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.127
Is that true?

07:31.552 --> 07:34.008
Listen here, you gent,
Columbus motherfucker.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.320
If you don't stay the fuck away...

07:35.345 --> 07:37.299
I don't know why I told
you about this neighborhood

07:37.324 --> 07:38.767
because y'all take everything!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.916
Can we have anything?! Leave!

07:41.428 --> 07:44.129
Guys, I really don't know, but I
do know we have a lot of work to do.

07:44.154 --> 07:46.631
And this bench needs to go
over there. Could you...?

07:46.656 --> 07:47.885
Oh, but we just moved it here.

07:47.910 --> 07:49.835
Oh, don't question my authority. Thanks!

07:49.860 --> 07:52.141
Hey, Issa!

07:52.166 --> 07:54.049
I wanted to introduce
you to Chef Babette.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.518
So nice to meet you. Thank you
so much for catering our event.

07:56.543 --> 07:59.221
My pleasure! Anything to
support the neighborhood.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.284
- My favorite restaurant is Stuff I Eat.
- Thank you!

08:02.309 --> 08:03.892
You've gotta tell me what's
in your carrot croquettes.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.861
I'm guessing it's
turmeric. Is it turmeric?

08:09.223 --> 08:11.664
- Hey!
- Oh, uh, Joanne, I'll be right back.

08:11.689 --> 08:13.124
- Oh...
- Hey, girl!

08:13.149 --> 08:14.903
- Hey!
- Thank you for making it.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.761
What are you doing? It's not that heavy.

08:16.786 --> 08:18.830
- Let's go!
- It's too heavy.

08:18.855 --> 08:20.542
- Oh, that's heavy.
- Use your wrists.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.145
- Keep going! Good job.
- Oh, my God.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.281
Girl, did I just see two white
families walking their dogs?

08:26.306 --> 08:28.455
Since when did Baldwin
Hills get all gentrified?

08:28.480 --> 08:30.976
When white people were sitting
up in their $4,000-a-month

08:31.001 --> 08:33.812
one-bedroom in Malibu like,
"Them niggas ain't that bad."

08:35.823 --> 08:38.193
- Thanks for helping me, though.
- Oh, my God, of course!

08:38.217 --> 08:39.918
- Is it going good?
- No, it's going really good.

08:39.943 --> 08:42.654
Like, tonight's about to
be inspirational as fuck.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.756
Yes! Oh, my God!

08:44.781 --> 08:47.236
Guess who I ran into.
You remember Crystal?

08:47.261 --> 08:48.570
Crystal with the fucked up shoes

08:48.595 --> 08:50.239
or Crystal with the
heavy-ass titty ring?

08:50.264 --> 08:53.999
- No, Crystal our RA from freshman year.
- Oh, yeah!

08:54.024 --> 08:55.901
She always had the
hookup on extra cereal

08:55.926 --> 08:58.679
- after she fucked that... janitor.
- ... Janitor!

08:58.704 --> 09:00.687
- How's she doing, though?
- She good.

09:00.712 --> 09:03.564
She through hoing. But
she's in therapy, though.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.722
Bitch, shut the fuck up!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.446
- You stupid!
- I swear!

09:08.471 --> 09:11.483
That's what she told me.
Just all over-shared and shit.

09:11.508 --> 09:14.173
- What made her start going?
- I don't know.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.688
She was all on some, "When
we was running the streets,

09:16.713 --> 09:20.242
"I was doing too much,
not valuing my value."

09:20.267 --> 09:22.861
Like you can't value yourself
and fuck at the same damn time?

09:22.886 --> 09:24.629
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

09:24.654 --> 09:27.666
And now she's all like, "I'm
so centered and I'm so zen.

09:27.691 --> 09:30.001
"I recommend therapy for everyone."

09:30.026 --> 09:32.579
Tsk, girl, bye.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.150
Did she say therapy was
working for her, though?

09:37.344 --> 09:41.665
I mean, I guess, but who wants to
go broke paying for a fake friend?

09:43.483 --> 09:47.819
But maybe talking through some shit
with someone isn't the worst idea.

09:49.290 --> 09:50.890
Bitch, you trying to say I
need therapy or something?

09:50.915 --> 09:53.425
Come on, no! Like...

09:53.527 --> 09:56.695
But, I mean, maybe 'cause, you know, the
stuff that you went through with Jared

09:56.720 --> 10:00.565
and... and even that lawyer
nigga, maybe it could help.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.567
Girl, even I would go.

10:08.681 --> 10:10.025
Bitch, you mad now?

10:10.050 --> 10:12.876
Why would I be mad when
you wrong as hell, Issa?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.414
Issa, where do these go?

10:16.516 --> 10:18.572
Patricia, you know where they go.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.123
Okay, hold. Great.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.339
Hey, look who I found!

10:32.364 --> 10:34.833
- Oh, hey! Welcome, kids!
- Wow!

10:34.935 --> 10:37.112
- Look at you guys.
- Wow!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.706
I bet a rapper lives here.

10:38.731 --> 10:41.463
Actually, this house
is owned by a dentist.

10:41.488 --> 10:43.253
But, like, a rapper's dentist?

10:43.278 --> 10:45.053
Rappers don't have dentists, stupid.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.911
Besides, only white people live up here.

10:46.936 --> 10:50.325
Uh, Dayniece, all people
need good oral hygiene.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.228
And this place is actually
owned by a black person.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.497
- This is a black neighborhood.
- For real?

10:55.522 --> 10:57.800
Yeah, and it's only 10
minutes away from your school,

10:57.825 --> 10:58.839
so if y'all study hard,

10:58.871 --> 11:00.168
- and y'all act right...
- Whoa!

11:00.193 --> 11:02.537
This dentists has a drawer
full of extra batteries!

11:02.562 --> 11:04.996
- What he need these for?
- Hey, guys.

11:05.021 --> 11:06.965
We can't just open
people's battery drawers.

11:06.990 --> 11:09.000
- Okay?
- And, kids, don't forget to hand out

11:09.025 --> 11:10.869
all your donation cards tonight, okay?

11:10.894 --> 11:13.605
And don't be afraid to
introduce yourselves and smile.

11:13.630 --> 11:16.120
- Yeah? Yeah!
- Hi. My name is Markese.

11:16.145 --> 11:18.076
How you doing? Nice to meet you. Hey.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.622
Hi. My name is Markese.
Very nice to meet you.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.113
Oh.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.939
- One of our big donors is here...
- Okay.

11:23.964 --> 11:25.917
... and Joanne wants me to talk to him.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.462
And I can't believe I'm saying this,

11:27.487 --> 11:29.573
but don't let the kids take anything.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.890
That only crossed my mind
once you said it. Okay.

11:31.915 --> 11:34.081
All right, guys.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.605
Here you go.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.676
Yeah. Uh-huh, okay.

11:51.701 --> 11:53.411
You cannot come to my birthday.

11:53.436 --> 11:55.447
- I don't wanna be there.
- It's girls only.

11:55.472 --> 11:58.216
Well, I paid for it, so
you used my money to do it.

11:58.241 --> 11:59.984
- Okay, you know...
- Which I wanted you to do.

12:00.009 --> 12:01.423
That's what I got you for your...

12:01.455 --> 12:03.330
This is a birthday present...

12:03.355 --> 12:05.468
- from us... me.
- No. Okay.

12:05.493 --> 12:08.259
- It'll be a great time.
- Guess who's rich, bitches!

12:08.284 --> 12:10.005
- Oh!
- Not me,

12:10.030 --> 12:12.931
but I just got that
guy to donate $5,000!

12:12.956 --> 12:15.911
I have never said the word
"disadvantaged" so many times.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.135
Way to go, Iss.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.371
And before I forget,
here's our donation.

12:20.396 --> 12:22.574
- What?
- Just a little something.

12:22.676 --> 12:24.442
- Thank you.
- And since he doing it...

12:24.544 --> 12:25.987
- Ooh!
- We gonna bam!

12:26.012 --> 12:28.146
What, Kelli! 500?

12:28.171 --> 12:31.976
Okay, don't cash that shit until
next month. I'ma be homeless.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.551
Seriously.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.286
I love the dress.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.337
Gotta work on the shoe,
but still love the dress.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.400
I will take that.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.582
I can't believe there's only
two bartenders back there.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.150
Like, seriously?

12:42.517 --> 12:45.181
Well, guys, I just wanna
thank you so much for coming

12:45.206 --> 12:46.495
and for donating.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.032
It just... it means a lot.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.801
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

12:49.903 --> 12:51.546
- Congratulations.
- We got you, girl.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.071
We got y'all!

12:53.096 --> 12:55.440
You know, so... we're not doing that?

12:55.465 --> 12:57.408
Cool, cool, cool. That was a joke.

12:57.433 --> 12:58.610
I thought there'd be

12:58.635 --> 13:00.912
at least a couple
good-looking dudes here,

13:00.937 --> 13:04.174
- but it's just old and bald dudes.
- That's my type.

13:04.199 --> 13:07.342
Well, at least the view is fantastic.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.787
Got my allergies acting up, though.

13:08.812 --> 13:10.388
There's hella smog tonight.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.934
- Damn, Molly, really?
- You don't feel that?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.826
This is LA. It's a smog city.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.661
- Oh.
- Do you need a Kleenex?

13:16.763 --> 13:18.573
Hey, yo, look at Lawrence

13:18.598 --> 13:20.765
looking like Eddie
Murphy in "Boomerang."

13:20.867 --> 13:22.834
- Hey!
- I see him!

13:22.936 --> 13:24.736
- What's up?
- Okay!

13:24.838 --> 13:26.905
Look at my boo all suited up and shit.

13:26.930 --> 13:29.378
What's up, y'all? Babe,
this place looks great.

13:29.403 --> 13:32.769
You killed it! Hey, you a genius.

13:34.725 --> 13:36.207
- You gonna tell them?
- No, come on.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.246
- Tell them!
- No, come...

13:37.271 --> 13:40.228
- What?
- All right, so I got this new job.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.421
- It's a tech company.
- Okay! All right, I see you.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.156
They got you benefits?

13:45.181 --> 13:47.068
'Cause the first thing you need
to do is get your eyes checked.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.827
You know they can tell
diabetes through your eyes?

13:48.852 --> 13:50.539
They're like, "betes." Mm-hmm.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.142
Hey, what are you
gonna be doing for them?

13:52.167 --> 13:54.309
Uh, it's really interesting, actually.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.167
It's a company called
Meridian, a few years old...

13:56.192 --> 13:58.469
Issa, can I steal you
for a sec? I'm so sorry.

13:58.494 --> 14:01.773
So, there's a very
important potential donor.

14:01.827 --> 14:05.295
I just... I wanna introduce
you to tonight's organizer,

14:05.320 --> 14:06.504
Issa Dee.

14:06.529 --> 14:08.503
I've heard so many good things.

14:08.582 --> 14:12.855
And a parent was just
telling me about Beach Day...

14:25.232 --> 14:27.474
I'll be right back, guys.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.705
- So much to talk about.
- Oh.

14:33.807 --> 14:36.256
Yeah, no, we're so happy.

14:36.653 --> 14:38.787
Thank you very much.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.225
Enjoy.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.176
Daniel, hey. What are you doing here?

14:43.201 --> 14:46.384
Right now, just trying to
fuck up this quesadilla.

14:46.409 --> 14:49.754
- Okay. Were you invited?
- Yeah.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.201
Really?

14:51.506 --> 14:53.235
Did some work at Career Day.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.894
- Just here for the kids.
- Oh, okay.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.796
Well, you know, let's just make
sure we keep it about the kids.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.615
Uh-huh.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.503
Bye, Molly.

15:10.053 --> 15:12.053
I'm definitely making
a donation tonight,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.890
because when I think about all
the people who've helped me,

15:14.915 --> 15:16.614
- I just have to give back.
- Mm-hmm.

15:16.639 --> 15:19.684
It's just important that
somebody... it's who I am.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.386
Yeah. I am so sorry.

15:21.411 --> 15:24.289
I think I see a child
who's been left behind.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.043
Excuse me a second.

15:28.739 --> 15:30.465
Why is he here? What... what did he say?

15:30.490 --> 15:32.641
- He said he's here for the kids.
- Yeah, but how did he say it?

15:32.666 --> 15:34.052
Is this nigga about to start some shit?

15:34.077 --> 15:35.590
I hope not.

15:35.669 --> 15:39.075
At least him and Lawrence
don't know each other, so...

15:40.200 --> 15:43.418
Fuck this. Just keep things
cool while I get him out of here.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.137
Okay.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.075
Yeah, good to see you. Thank you.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.683
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for, uh...

15:51.722 --> 15:53.455
Yeah, you really helped
those kids out before.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.153
- It means everything...
- Sorry, excuse me.

15:55.178 --> 15:57.345
- Hey. Sure.
- I need to see you.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.893
You need to leave.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.672
Like, I know you're
mad at me or whatever,

16:03.697 --> 16:05.674
but this is my job, okay?

16:05.699 --> 16:07.465
This isn't the time
or the place for drama.

16:07.490 --> 16:08.361
Hold up.

16:08.386 --> 16:11.703
I don't hear from you in three weeks and
that's the first thing out your mouth?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.402
After all the shit we done
been through, like, for real?

16:16.343 --> 16:19.918
I know stuff at the studio,
it happened kind of fast,

16:19.943 --> 16:22.215
but why you acting like
it wasn't something?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.887
Okay, yeah, it happened,
but I was confused

16:24.912 --> 16:26.855
and... and you've been texting me

16:26.880 --> 16:28.738
and pressing me all hard.

16:28.763 --> 16:30.288
Really?

16:30.796 --> 16:32.229
Daniel, you knew I had a boyfriend.

16:32.254 --> 16:33.668
You're trying to blame
me for what you did?

16:33.693 --> 16:36.519
- You're not a victim, Issa.
- You're being real loud right now.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.527
I didn't even come here for
all this, Issa, all right?

16:39.552 --> 16:41.676
I just wanted to look you in the eye

16:41.701 --> 16:45.503
and ask you why you were treating
me like I'm some random-ass nigga.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.488
You were just an itch
I needed to scratch.

16:57.326 --> 16:58.725
Wow.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.261
Wow.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.012
So?

17:29.411 --> 17:31.800
- He is leaving.
- Good.

17:32.495 --> 17:35.296
Issa. This is so great!

17:35.321 --> 17:37.732
- The kids are thrilled to be here.
- Oh, good.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.301
Um, Justin, this is Molly.
Molly, this is Justin.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.002
- He teaches at Thomas Jefferson.
- Hi.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.402
- Aren't you the lawyer from Career Day?
- I am.

17:44.427 --> 17:46.488
The kids could not
stop talking about you.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.700
Oh, well, I hope nothing I
said went over their heads.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.736
Oh, I only heard the best things.

17:53.316 --> 17:55.350
May I get you a drink, Molly?

17:55.375 --> 17:57.809
Or do you object?

18:01.614 --> 18:04.315
No, I'm good. I'm not drinking tonight.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.831
Okay, sounds great.

18:09.105 --> 18:12.256
- Um, I'll catch up with you two later.
- Okay.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.358
- Good to see you, Justin.
- Okay. Yeah, okay.

18:15.566 --> 18:17.562
Jackie Chan is too thirsty.

18:17.587 --> 18:19.897
"Or do you object?"

18:19.922 --> 18:23.290
Way to make it weird,
bro. I'll be right back.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.943
- Check it.
- Here you go.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.111
Thanks, man.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.187
- We'll bring that right out.
- Thank you.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.539
So, what's, uh... what's your
connection to We Got Y'all?

18:53.505 --> 18:55.679
I don't have one anymore.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.479
Gracias, amigo.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.930
- Hey!
- You good?

19:26.032 --> 19:28.013
Everything's great. Thank you.

19:31.310 --> 19:33.037
Girl, you all right?

19:33.139 --> 19:36.674
I'd be better if they'd stop
pouring these weak-ass drinks.

19:37.911 --> 19:40.410
Okay, what the fuck is up?

19:40.435 --> 19:43.791
Nothing. I'm just over this day.

19:43.816 --> 19:47.028
Yo, it's not nothing 'cause you were
rude as hell to Justin back there.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.921
And I have to work with
him. Why you tripping?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.455
Oh, so I'm tripping?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.291
You're over there acting
like I'm raggedy and shit,

19:53.316 --> 19:55.826
telling me I need therapy when
your mess is all over the place.

19:55.851 --> 19:57.590
So, that's why you've
been pissy all night,

19:57.615 --> 20:01.132
because I vaguely suggested
therapy might be good for you?

20:01.234 --> 20:04.202
- Clearly, I was onto something.
- Oh, for real?

20:04.227 --> 20:05.813
Like your shit ain't all fucked up?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.482
Like I wasn't just distracting your man

20:07.507 --> 20:09.051
right after schooling your side nigga?

20:09.076 --> 20:12.026
What? What? Why are you
throwing that shit in my face?

20:12.051 --> 20:16.013
I made a mistake, but at least I
can see the shit that I do wrong.

20:16.038 --> 20:18.026
- What do I do wrong, Issa?
- Do you really wanna know?

20:18.051 --> 20:19.951
- Please tell me.
- Okay, have you noticed, Molly,

20:19.976 --> 20:23.916
the common denominator in all your
"can't find a man" bullshit is you?

20:23.941 --> 20:25.767
Yeah, let's do the nigga rundown, Molly.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.091
One minute, he's too thirsty.

20:27.116 --> 20:28.693
The next minute, he's too distant.

20:28.718 --> 20:30.572
The next, he's too gay!

20:30.597 --> 20:33.308
And then when you do find
someone that you actually like,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.604
you ruin it by doing too fucking much.

20:35.629 --> 20:38.246
You act like finding
someone is supposed to be

20:38.271 --> 20:41.038
some sort of fairy tale, but it's not.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.508
- You're impossible to please!
- I'm impossible to please?

20:44.559 --> 20:46.487
You can't commit to anything!

20:46.512 --> 20:50.425
Did I say shit when you were complaining
about your job for five fucking years

20:50.450 --> 20:51.693
like you can't change that shit?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.894
You've been on the fence,

20:52.919 --> 20:55.697
whining about your relationship forever,

20:55.722 --> 20:57.637
but did I say a motherfucking
thing about that?

20:57.662 --> 20:59.082
Oh, shut up, Molly.

20:59.107 --> 21:01.092
The-the shit that you said
wasn't even all my fault,

21:01.117 --> 21:03.238
and yet you act like
shit is black and white.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.975
You fucked another man when your
man was fixing his shit for you!

21:07.000 --> 21:09.090
Bitch, you don't even deserve Lawrence.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.173
Are you mad that I can
actually keep a nigga?

21:19.149 --> 21:21.182
Fuck you, Issa.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.404
Um, oh, hey, can we cut the music?

21:46.429 --> 21:48.806
Uh, Miss DJ, can we
cut the music? Thanks.

21:48.831 --> 21:52.520
Um, okay. So, if I could
have everyone's attention.

21:52.545 --> 21:56.538
The kids would like to...
Dayniece and the kids

21:56.563 --> 21:58.449
would like to say a few words.

21:58.474 --> 22:01.218
So, Dayniece, take it away.

22:04.213 --> 22:06.313
Sorry.

22:08.984 --> 22:10.772
Where'd you go?

22:11.138 --> 22:12.671
Get some air.

22:15.589 --> 22:17.356
Where's Molly?

22:17.733 --> 22:19.247
She left.

22:19.272 --> 22:22.306
- It's gonna... oh, there you go.
- Thank you.

22:22.408 --> 22:25.186
Um, we would like to thank We Got Y'all

22:25.211 --> 22:28.612
for taking us to this nice
house in our own neighborhood,

22:28.637 --> 22:31.101
which I'ma buy someday.

22:33.353 --> 22:36.077
When I grow up, I'ma
buy me extra batteries.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.957
Aim higher.

22:39.982 --> 22:41.733
And also, we'd like to give

22:41.758 --> 22:44.264
an extra special thank
you to Miss Issa...

22:46.079 --> 22:47.979
for all her hard work.

22:50.182 --> 22:51.582
Yes!

22:54.569 --> 22:56.319
Go, Miss Issa!

22:57.477 --> 22:58.976
Whoo!

22:59.078 --> 23:00.858
Yes!

23:21.033 --> 23:22.981
I promise I'm not drunk this time.

23:23.006 --> 23:25.780
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I know you're over me.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.348
Hell, I'm over me, too.

23:27.373 --> 23:30.208
But I realize I was going
about us the wrong way

23:30.233 --> 23:33.744
and I just had all these unrealistic
expectations about relationships.

23:33.769 --> 23:35.413
And, you know, when it came to us,

23:35.438 --> 23:37.577
I should've just lowered my standards.

23:37.602 --> 23:38.669
What?

23:38.694 --> 23:40.050
Wait. No, I didn't mean it like that.

23:40.075 --> 23:42.853
I meant, like, I can
meet you on your level.

23:42.878 --> 23:45.356
Not that it's, like, a
lower level, but it's just...

23:45.741 --> 23:47.068
Shit, Jared,

23:47.093 --> 23:50.861
you were just different
than what I thought.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.596
Okay, look.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.865
I can't hang my life

23:54.890 --> 23:56.834
on trying to date the perfect guy,

23:56.859 --> 24:00.874
so I should've just learned
to be happy with you.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.874
Shit, I'm still not saying it right.

24:03.983 --> 24:05.960
But, fuck, um...

24:05.985 --> 24:08.483
Look, I'm tired.

24:34.468 --> 24:37.123
Woof, my dogs are howling.

24:37.148 --> 24:39.844
Yep, arch support is important.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.818
I'm so glad we made our goal, though.

24:41.843 --> 24:43.658
It was touch-and-go there for a minute.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.784
It's always
touch-and-go.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.053
We find a way to make it work.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.790
So, where do you see yourself in a year?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.059
Uh, hopefully at We Got Y'all.

24:55.238 --> 24:57.004
Wait, are you firing me?

24:57.029 --> 25:00.164
No. You're doing a great job.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.735
This is who I've been wanting to see.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.675
Take it before they check.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.608
Don't have to tell me twice.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.121
Hey, babe!

25:25.224 --> 25:29.393
Ugh, I am so glad...

25:29.495 --> 25:32.696
this night is over!

25:32.721 --> 25:34.765
And I got us a present.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.267
Bam!

25:36.837 --> 25:38.937
Who's Daniel?

25:40.373 --> 25:42.455
- Hmm?
- Daniel.

25:43.509 --> 25:45.665
That's who was there tonight, right?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.623
Yeah, we went to high school together,

25:48.648 --> 25:53.651
um, and he volunteered
at that Career Day we had.

25:53.676 --> 25:55.916
He did this, like, music
presentation for the kids,

25:55.941 --> 25:58.135
so they must've invited him.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.392
Did you fuck him?

26:02.628 --> 26:03.827
What?

26:05.097 --> 26:07.688
- Why would you ask me that?
- 'Cause I am.

26:07.713 --> 26:11.715
Did you fuck him?

26:20.079 --> 26:22.371
- You fucked that nigga?!
- I'm so sorry.

26:22.396 --> 26:24.426
What the fuck? Wait, you fucked him?!

26:24.451 --> 26:26.856
I'm so sorry! I
didn't... I didn't mean...

26:26.881 --> 26:28.109
You're not fucking sorry!

26:28.187 --> 26:30.087
Then you're just gonna throw
that nigga in my face tonight?

26:30.112 --> 26:31.666
I didn't know he was gonna be there!

26:31.691 --> 26:34.387
I told him what we did was a mistake.

26:34.412 --> 26:38.039
Oh, so you fucked up our shit for
some nigga who's a goddam mistake?

26:39.240 --> 26:40.788
Did you fuck him more than once?

26:40.813 --> 26:42.129
- Did you fuck him more than once?
- No!

26:42.154 --> 26:44.035
- You're fucking lying!
- Lawrence, come on!

26:44.060 --> 26:45.636
Fuck!

26:45.661 --> 26:47.605
Fuck, I thought we were in this, Issa!

26:47.630 --> 26:49.773
- We are.
- I'm so fucking stupid, man!

26:49.798 --> 26:52.109
Lawrence, I'm stupid! Just
tell me what I can do...

26:52.134 --> 26:54.432
- I need to get the fuck out of here.
- Lawrence, please!

26:54.457 --> 26:56.046
- Please don't go. Lawrence!
- Get the fuck out of... Issa.

26:56.071 --> 26:57.699
- Issa, get the fuck out of the way.
- No!

26:57.724 --> 26:59.488
- Issa, get the fuck out of the way.
- Just talk to me.

26:59.513 --> 27:01.496
There ain't shit to talk
about. Get out the way.

27:01.521 --> 27:03.028
Lawrence, I'm not moving.

27:03.053 --> 27:04.510
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Issa, move.

27:04.535 --> 27:07.965
- Just talk to me.
- Get the fuck out of the way.

27:08.605 --> 27:11.005
- Lawrence, I am not...
- Issa, move.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.631
- Come on! I...
- Move!

27:15.868 --> 27:18.207
Fuck! Come on.
