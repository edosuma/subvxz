WEBVTT

00:01.520 --> 00:04.160
Here you go, little hatchling.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.160
Ooh, it's gonna be so snuggly.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.120
[exclaiming in disgust]
Let's get rid of that.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.960
Little one.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.360
Amy?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.000
Amy!

00:21.200 --> 00:22.960
Oh.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.720
I know what's going on. [chuckles]

00:26.920 --> 00:30.400
A sneaky game of hide-and-seek. [chuckles]

00:30.680 --> 00:34.320
Well, little did you know,
I am an expert at hide-and-seek,

00:34.400 --> 00:36.880
because of my alcoholic wife. [laughs]

00:41.160 --> 00:42.320
[Paula] Sorry, it's no children.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.280
What? It's not a child, it's a baby.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.400
Well, there's references
to suicide and all sorts,

00:46.520 --> 00:48.440
-so I'm afraid it's an adults-only event.
-My mum's in there

00:48.520 --> 00:50.120
and I just wanted to say hello.
She wrote the book.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.720
-Not with that baby.
-It's a baby.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.840
She doesn't understand
anything you're saying. She can't read.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.320
-Is it 18 years old?
-Is this baby 18 years old?

00:56.400 --> 00:57.240
-Yes.
-No.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.960
-So it's not allowed.
-Okay, fine.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.600
-This lovely lady...
-What are you doing?

01:00.920 --> 01:01.920
-Er, no.
-...is going to look after you...

01:02.000 --> 01:03.200
-Oh. No.
-...for a bit. Thank you.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.760
Er, excuse me? No.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.000
[baby yelps]

01:08.200 --> 01:12.120
Sneaky, cheeky hide-and-seek-y.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.320
Ah-ha! [chuckles]

01:14.560 --> 01:15.520
Ha!

01:16.040 --> 01:16.880
Ah-ha!

01:18.840 --> 01:20.080
[muttering excitedly]

01:20.200 --> 01:22.400
Like your husband, I found
the medication very helpful.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.320
Yes, good.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.080
But obviously, you never know
when the darkness is going to descend,

01:26.160 --> 01:29.080
so, my question was actually about salmon.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.280
Oh. Yes.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.560
'Cause you're saying that the fatty acids
are good for the brain.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.480
[Amy] Excuse me.
[Deborah] That's right.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
-[Dennis] I don't like, er, salmon.
-Hey, Mum.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.840
-Amy, what are you doing here?
-I need to talk to you

01:37.920 --> 01:40.280
-about <i>The Baumgaertner Trick.</i>
-Okay. Just give me a second.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.680
-I need to talk to you now.
-Are you alright?

01:41.920 --> 01:43.400
-Why have you--
-I'm fine. I just need to talk to you.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.280
-Okay, just give me two seconds.
-I'll be over here.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.240
I'm working.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.760
So, salmon.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.120
-[all chanting] M-Dog. M-Dog. M-Dog.
-[Shun] Mr Flowers.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.680
Well done, well done, well done.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.560
[all cheering]

01:59.520 --> 02:02.400
Stay in your seat, you imbecile!
I said belts on!

02:02.680 --> 02:04.440
-I'm so sorry about all this.
-It's alright.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.320
And then, it starts to get weird
and you realise you've been

02:07.400 --> 02:08.920
collecting hundreds of bottles--

02:09.000 --> 02:10.200
Yes. Do you mind just giving me two ticks,

02:10.280 --> 02:11.680
-so I can say a quick hello to my--
-[sighs]

02:11.760 --> 02:12.880
[Dennis] 'Cause you're going to learn
how to brew...

02:12.960 --> 02:13.960
Come on.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.440
...elderflower champagne and start
an international catering business,

02:16.520 --> 02:17.680
and it's like, erm...

02:18.560 --> 02:21.360
-It's actually quite mad, isn't it?
-Er, not mad. Ill. [chuckles]

02:22.160 --> 02:25.240
[Dennis] Then it gets a bit bleak again.
I start feeling like shit.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.320
Walking across bridges. [shivering] Erm,

02:29.960 --> 02:30.800
back to the doctor's.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.360
-Your grandad...
-[gunshot]

02:32.840 --> 02:34.160
Baumgaertner.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.720
<i>Baumgaertner.</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:37.680
<i>Baumgaertner.</i>

02:38.080 --> 02:39.480

02:40.800 --> 02:43.600
[Wendy] Die Auserwählte. <i>The Chosen One.</i>
<i>It's German.</i>

02:43.680 --> 02:45.600
<i>When it gets dark</i>
<i>I turn into a butterfly...</i>

02:45.760 --> 02:48.760
What do you think I should do?
Because I don't have a girlfriend, so...

02:49.720 --> 02:50.840
What do you think I should do?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.640
I, erm, I... I don't know.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.600
I'm sorry. Erm,
we're not actually together anymore, so...

02:58.760 --> 02:59.960
Oh, what the fuck.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.520
[Maurice] <i>Everyone. Everyone. A toast...</i>

03:02.920 --> 03:06.160
to the most loyal,
patient, beautiful friend,

03:06.440 --> 03:07.280
Shunny Boy.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.360

-Shunny boy!

03:09.480 --> 03:10.920
[all chanting] Shun. Shun. Shun.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.520
You are my friend as well.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.520
I love you.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.280
I wanted to let loose, but it was obvious

03:15.360 --> 03:18.840
these squidiot dickheads would
get wasted and trashed

03:18.920 --> 03:20.520
and there'd be no one
to drive home safely.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.240
My wife showed me how to do this.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.360
You're quite responsible, aren't you?

03:26.360 --> 03:29.040
-I guess so, yeah.
-Team M-Dog!

03:29.440 --> 03:31.120
Hence drinking Naked Russians all night.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.440
-Do you mean milk?
-[Donald] Well...

03:34.120 --> 03:35.080
And ice.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.480
Because I did notice that you were
drinking quite a lot of milk.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.600
-Milkman.
-Shut up, Shun!

03:40.680 --> 03:43.080
You had quite a milky moustache.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.520
Milkman. Yes, I see.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.680
She is a bitch! A bitch!

03:48.760 --> 03:51.600
Yes, I hate her! I hate her!

Team M-Dog! Team M-Dog!

04:04.120 --> 04:05.640
[Maurice] Want to play twist the bottle?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.640
Twist the bottle. Twist the bottle.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.680
Dad, stop being a pervert
or I'm throwing you out the van.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.400
Whose fault is that?

04:12.480 --> 04:14.680
Er, who wants to play
twist the bottle with my son?

04:15.000 --> 04:15.920
[all] No.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.080
Oh, you wish!

04:17.800 --> 04:19.280
Dad, shut up and fuck off, please!

04:19.400 --> 04:21.040
Who do you want to play it with then, Don?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.680
I know answer. Matilda cha.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.040
-Fuck off!
-[all cheering]

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
Fuck off, Shun!

04:29.080 --> 04:29.920
Sushi head!

04:30.720 --> 04:32.120
[tyres screeching]

04:33.080 --> 04:36.120
Shut up! Or I'm not driving!
I don't even fancy her!

04:36.680 --> 04:38.440
She's just a customer
and I felt sorry for her

04:38.680 --> 04:40.720
because she's poor and her house is shit.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.400
She used to be fat.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.600
She's Fat Matilda.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.120
[chuckling] Of course I don't fancy her.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.920
God's sake.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.520
[Barry] <i>Amy?</i>

04:57.400 --> 04:59.920
I don't want to come in
if you're in your smalls.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.840
Little baby?

05:04.440 --> 05:07.720
Are you in there
with your auntie Amy, huh?

05:11.040 --> 05:11.880
Come on.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.840
Right. Erm,

05:15.040 --> 05:16.440
put your dressing gown on.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.600
I'm coming in.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.640
[distorted laughter]

06:08.400 --> 06:10.240
[Bolero] I wouldn't eat those
if I were you, love.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.160
Catch the plague.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.640
They've been marinated in piss,

06:15.880 --> 06:18.120
all sorts for about a hundred years.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.720
What's a nice-looking
young mother like you

06:22.800 --> 06:24.240
doing in a place like this?

06:24.800 --> 06:25.800
Looking for a job?

06:26.160 --> 06:27.280
Oh, no.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.880
I'm not a prostitute.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.400
[chuckles]

06:34.920 --> 06:36.320
[glass shatters]

06:38.320 --> 06:39.720
You're meant to catch that.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.440
Is Wendy here?

06:43.760 --> 06:45.000
Some jingle-jangle.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.360
For the intel.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.040
[cheers and applause]

07:59.360 --> 08:00.320
Barry?

08:03.240 --> 08:04.120
Barry?

08:05.240 --> 08:06.680
Barry, can I see my baby?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.120
[stammers] I don't think
you should come in.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.520
She's sleeping very soundly.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.000
Honestly. I, I, I'll take care of it.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.640
Can I just come in, though?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.160
[mimics baby crying] Aw. [shushing]

08:19.480 --> 08:21.040
It's alright, little one.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.200
You nearly woke her then.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.880
[gagging]

08:27.160 --> 08:28.040
Shit.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.640
[Barry trembling]

08:35.480 --> 08:36.320
What have I done?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.400
Come on, Barry, come on, think.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.320
What's your favourite film?

08:49.720 --> 08:52.560
Erm, don't know. What's yours?

08:53.320 --> 08:54.480
Probably cling film.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.720
No. <i>Age Of Machines,</i> obviously. Brilliant.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.960
Yeah. I might head off in a minute.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.240
Already?

09:04.800 --> 09:06.800
I was just about to engage party mode.

09:07.000 --> 09:07.960
Bit tired.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.720
Okay. Well, can I give you a lift?

09:11.120 --> 09:12.200
Er, no, it's alright.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.720
I'm still under the limit.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.640
Okay, whatever.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.960
Whoa. What are you doing?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.280
What are you doing?

09:23.840 --> 09:24.720
Sorry!

09:28.240 --> 09:29.200
[Maurice] Shun?

09:32.440 --> 09:33.440
Alright.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.120
So your family died in an earthquake?

09:41.840 --> 09:42.760
Mm-hmm.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.160
There I am,
taking all my shit out on your bum hole.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.720
I just need to check something.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.000
You're not going
to press charges, are you?

10:06.080 --> 10:06.920
What?

10:07.080 --> 10:09.040
For... just then.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.800
When I tried to kiss you.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
Erm, no.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.640
Don't worry.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.920
Okay. Good.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.560
Because...

10:20.440 --> 10:21.800
I just assumed.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.680
-What are you doing now?
-What?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.360
I just need to know
that if I try and kiss you,

10:37.440 --> 10:38.480
you're not going to move away again.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.240
Well, what do you want? A signed document?

10:40.360 --> 10:42.280
-So you do want to?
-Just forget it.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.560
Oh, God. Make your mind up.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.320
I don't know how I feel about you.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.680
I don't know how I feel about you, mate.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.880
One minute you're Queen Frigid-Lips,
the next minute you're a fat slag again.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.440
Right. Good. Okay.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.800
I do know how I feel about you, actually.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.840
Bye.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.520
Oh. Thanks for fixing my sink.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.520
Twat!

11:06.200 --> 11:07.040
[Maurice] Shun.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.560
[dance music playing]

11:09.120 --> 11:10.000
[Shun] Yes?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.240
Is this Bulgarian?

11:12.560 --> 11:14.400
Yeah, just put it all in a big bowl.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.040
Shun, baby dawg.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.480
Er, put it all in a big bowl for these
fine young ladies, if you please.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.560
Excuse me. Excusez-moi.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.440
Sorry. [chuckling]

11:26.040 --> 11:27.800
-Yeah. This is what--
-[glass shattering]

11:27.880 --> 11:29.240
-Yes.
-[Dolores] M-Dog.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.640
[cheering]

11:31.720 --> 11:33.920
Woooo-hooo-whooo.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.440
Erm, excuse me.
I'm going to need that for next time.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.280
-It's cardboard.
-I know.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.840
I was going to recycle it but... Oh.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.400
Do you know what, you just keep it.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.040
-Well, I don't want it, it's rubbish.
-Well, then throw it away.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.000
Well, if anything I'll recycle it.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.680
Hi.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.160
Hello.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.320
-Er, how did it go?
-Erm,

12:10.440 --> 12:11.960
not very well, thank you very much.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.640
I think Amy might've already gone,
so, er, if you came to see her--

12:14.840 --> 12:16.280
I assume you're not here for me.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.720
Not here for you, no.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.280
Well, you should probably go home then.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.840
I mean, I'm here to see you.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.160
Just not for you, if you know what I mean.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.080
Hylda, I'm sorry about the other day,
but I'm just, I'm going to get a kebab

12:26.240 --> 12:28.440
and I'm going to go home.
So could we, maybe do this another time?

12:28.560 --> 12:31.800
-'Cause it's been a horrible day.
-Oh. Why is that, then?

12:31.880 --> 12:33.800
Because I'm not qualified
to have written this book.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.840
Every time I try
and make something better,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.880
I just make it worse, Hylda.
I just make it worse.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.920
And, er, look, I know I was rude
the other day, but she's my baby.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.400
She's my little squiggle.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.960
Donald was the squoggle
and she's the squiggle,

12:43.040 --> 12:45.640
and, erm, you're just not what I expected,
that's all.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.240
Erm, and with Amy,
I've sort of given up trying to...

12:48.320 --> 12:49.520
I've sort of given up trying to...

12:50.280 --> 12:51.840
Could I maybe, erm...

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
give you a lift?

12:54.640 --> 12:56.200
[Paula] Sorry, just, erm...

12:56.600 --> 12:58.400
do you actually want this or not?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.880
Because I just spoke to Carol
and she told me to pulp it.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.440
[Wendy] It's not a cult, and I'm not
a witch, and I never slept with him.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.680
Though your grandad did
fool around quite a bit.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.800
So did your nana.
I take it you know about James?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.560
But why did you call me <i>Die Auserwahlte?</i>

13:14.680 --> 13:16.520
Oh, that, yeah,
just amusing meself, really.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.640
I just, I need you to tell me
about The Baumgaertner Trick.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.480
What, that it wasn't a trick gun?
Of course it was a trick gun.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.000
Spread that rumour himself, the pillock.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.360
-No. What?
-You mean the Russian Roulette trick?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.160
Here, look. Bring the baba.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.320
Fucking terrible magician.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.440
Brilliant showman,
but constantly fucking everything up.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.720
Nearly sawed poor little Harriet in half.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.680
Possibly on purpose. Who knows?
Look at all this crap.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.560
Bingo.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.880
He'd finish the trick by shooting a vase.
Bit of a flourish.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.200
But he had such a terrible aim
that in the end

13:50.400 --> 13:52.280
he put a little banger in with the roses

13:52.520 --> 13:54.080
and set it off with a little wire.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.760
No bullets in the gun at all.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.600
Shouting at the Devil
like he was in the room.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.440
Going on and on about
how he was going to break the curse.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.840
Bendy Wendy, he used to call me.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.920
This lot waltz in here,
chuck their kit off.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.160
I have to fold myself into a cocoon,
for crying out loud.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.720
Hang on. Could I show you something?

14:13.800 --> 14:15.880
This was in the suitcase you gave me.
What is it?

14:15.960 --> 14:16.920
Ah.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.480
Bum Gardener.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.440
I remember him talking about this.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.040
-What, what'd you mean?
-Yeah,

14:24.120 --> 14:25.640
around the time he went to the asylum.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.200
What asylum? He drowned.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.680
Drowned? Nah.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.480
Harriet told little Maurice
he'd performed a vanishing act.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.720
He didn't buy it,
so she told him he drowned.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.840
So he didn't die?

14:35.720 --> 14:37.480
Well, he died eventually.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.440
Last I heard, went to Germany.
Popped his clogs there.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.120
What are you talking about?
What is this book?

14:43.200 --> 14:44.800
Why am I <i>Die Auserwählte?</i>

14:44.880 --> 14:47.320
You do know
Felix changed his name, don't ya?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.680
From Baumgaertner.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.080
'Cause it sounded
too much like Bum Gardener.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.880
His grandmother painted these, darling.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.600
This is your family.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.760
<i>Die Auserwählte.</i>

15:19.280 --> 15:20.240
Where do you want it?

15:20.680 --> 15:21.560
Thank you.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.920
Yes, I'll just, erm...

15:24.880 --> 15:26.920
Okay. Thank you for the kebab.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.120
-Erm...
-Oh, I'm hungry.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.040
What did you say this was again?

15:33.720 --> 15:35.040
Oh, Fizzy Shizz.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.320
It's nice.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.080
That one's grapefruit.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.400
Grapefruit Grenade.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.800
Yes, well, I'll try it. Okay.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.640
Amy gives me a hard time about it.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.400
-Wreaks havoc with your insides.
-Okay.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.080
-Alright. See you soon.
-Erm,

15:49.320 --> 15:50.520
er, Deborah.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.120
Yeah, er...

15:53.960 --> 15:55.240
the thing is, it's just...

15:55.640 --> 15:59.440
I had a couple of questions
I wanted to ask you about Amy.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.360
Erm...

16:04.040 --> 16:06.560
I'm an addict,
so I know how to talk to addicts.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.640
I know how to handle that. But...

16:10.400 --> 16:12.920
Whatever it is that Amy has...

16:15.680 --> 16:18.400
I'm sorry to come to you,
it's just that, well,

16:18.520 --> 16:21.200
I never really had a mother
and I've never been one either,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.360
and you seem...

16:24.800 --> 16:25.760
I dunno.

16:27.080 --> 16:27.960
[sighs]

16:32.440 --> 16:34.240
I love her, Deborah. That's all.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.200
And I'm starting to worry about...

17:09.360 --> 17:11.520
[crying]

17:16.000 --> 17:17.600
Amy! What are you doing in there?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.480
You need to
shut this party down immediately!

17:20.560 --> 17:22.040
It's a fucking travesty!

17:23.480 --> 17:25.800
-[stuttering nervously] Come, come in.
-What?

17:26.400 --> 17:27.440
What's going on?

17:27.720 --> 17:28.920
Just come in here!

17:36.800 --> 17:38.440
-Mauricio.
-That's my name

17:38.520 --> 17:40.800
Oh! Mauricio.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.160
Mauricio. [laughing]

17:45.320 --> 17:46.520
-[knocking]
-Dad!

17:47.680 --> 17:48.720
Go away,

17:49.360 --> 17:50.240
Donald.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.280
There's an emergency.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.880
Amy's disappeared with Shun's pervert
girlfriend's bastard baby from Sweden.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.400
[Maurice] Have you checked the church?

17:56.720 --> 17:58.640
Maybe she's just
gone for a walk or something.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.200
Oh, fucking useless.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.400
And by the way, I think it's really weird

18:02.480 --> 18:04.000
you're trying to have sex
with her friends.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.960
I know you're upset about Mum
and that you're depressed,

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
and I'm sorry about that,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.600
but there's better ways
of dealing with it, aren't there?

18:19.480 --> 18:20.320
[gunshot]

18:21.920 --> 18:22.760
Right.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.640
I'm going to sort this out.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.560
Half of us are going to the church
and half of us are going to the woods.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.360
Donald, relax.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.800
Amy-chan will come back soon.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.120
Gather round, everyone. I've got a map.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.800
Ignore him. He's drunk again.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.160
Yes, I'm drunk. So what?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.080
So it's not helpful. Japanese idiot.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.360
So what I'm Japanese? I am Japanese.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.000
I'm trying to manage a crisis here,
you fucking bell-end!

18:42.280 --> 18:44.480
Will you stop bullying me?
I know it's not banter.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.440
I know you trick me.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.000
-Did you just push me?
-Yes, I push you.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.200
I push you again.
I've had enough of you, nonsense.

18:49.480 --> 18:50.560
-Enough booze!
-Hey!

18:50.800 --> 18:52.360
-I can drink if I want!
-Enough!

18:52.440 --> 18:55.000
-This is my family!
-No, it's not! Your family's dead!

18:55.400 --> 18:56.880
So what my family's dead?

18:57.040 --> 18:59.600
At least I know why I'm miserable
when my family's dead.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.840
Give me more earthquake, motherfucker!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.000
Give me the booze!

19:03.080 --> 19:04.600
Give back my Irish Cream!

19:04.680 --> 19:06.640
My family's Irish Cream!

19:07.240 --> 19:09.040
You fucking bastard!

19:09.240 --> 19:11.520
You are just annoyed
because you are stupid virgin!

19:11.680 --> 19:13.880
No life, can't have sex
because you are so rude!

19:13.960 --> 19:15.560
Everybody think you are a complete idiot!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.240
[Donald grunting]

19:17.320 --> 19:20.200
[Shun] Come on! Come on then!
Come on then, English!

19:21.520 --> 19:23.200
[Henri] Just break it up,
get off each other.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.080
[Donald] The pincer! Yeah!

19:25.160 --> 19:26.080
[Pan] Just break it up.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.440
[Shun] Very naughty.
[Donald] You are naughty.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.840
[Pan] Shun, stop now.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.800
[Dolores] Get off him.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.920
[groaning] Oh, fuck.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.080
What's the matter?

19:37.160 --> 19:38.680
It's fine, it's fine. It's my back.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.360
-Compressed nerve.
-Ah.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.280
[Deborah] Hey! Stop that!

19:45.360 --> 19:46.760
Stop that immediately!

19:55.240 --> 19:56.240
[knocking]

19:56.360 --> 19:58.600
Oh, what now? Don't come in.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.040
-[door rattling]
-Donald, go away!

20:01.120 --> 20:02.920
[Deborah] Maurice, is there
someone else in there with you?

20:03.920 --> 20:04.840
Deborah?

20:05.480 --> 20:06.640
What are you doing here?

20:06.800 --> 20:07.960
Where's Amy?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.320
Erm, I don't know.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.200
Why don't you know? I'm coming in.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.240
Please don't.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.520
Jesus Christ.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.280
What-- Maurice.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.680
I love you.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.200
Can you give us some...

20:22.320 --> 20:24.400
I love you, Deborah.
It's the only reason why.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.800
Oh, Audrey...

20:49.920 --> 20:51.520
[Amy laughing]

20:51.800 --> 20:52.640
Monkey!

20:54.360 --> 20:55.760
Monkey. I'm a Baumgaertner.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.920
[Donald] What are you on about?
[Henri] Is the baby okay?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.160
[Amy] Yeah, course she is.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.240
[Deborah] Amy?

21:00.320 --> 21:02.800
[exclaiming excitedly]
Mum, what are you doing here?

21:03.120 --> 21:05.080
What is-- Why is there a baby?

21:05.240 --> 21:08.080
Dad, I'm a Baumgaertner.
Felix was a Baumgaertner.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.160
-Amy, what you talking about?
-We're all Bum Gardeners.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.240
And he didn't drown.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.600
Dad, Felix didn't drown.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.560
Nana just made that up
so that you wouldn't get upset.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.120
Amy, that's not funny.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.520
I'm not joking.
He went to a fucking asylum.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.280
Then he died in Germany.
That's what. It's about us.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.560
We're cursed. It's the Baumgaertner curse.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.360
It's in my blood, it's in her blood.
It's the same blood!

21:27.480 --> 21:30.520
That baby's the only surviving--
It's our direct ascendant.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.080
-So she gave me-- It's an heirloom.
-Whoa.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.000
It's a fucking Baumgaertner gun,
and now I have it.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.440
-How amazing is that?
-Amy, put the gun down.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.680
-Why, it's just a--
-[gunshot]

21:39.760 --> 21:41.240
[Donald] Holy Moses! Shit!

21:41.320 --> 21:43.120
Oh, shit. [laughing]

21:43.240 --> 21:44.680
Didn't realise it was loaded,

21:44.840 --> 21:46.800
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Amy, put the gun down.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.520
Mum, Mum, I'm going to fix this.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.600
-I know, I know how to fix it.
-Amy!

21:51.680 --> 21:53.320
Put the gun down!

21:53.400 --> 21:54.600
She was just trying to break the curse.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.760
She was trying protect her baby.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.120
She was trying to burn down
all the fucking shit that came before

21:59.200 --> 22:01.240
because how else is she meant to survive?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.360
It's like you with your dad.
It's like me with you.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
It's love.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.760
These pictures are about love.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.000
They're not about murder,
they're about love.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.320
That's all I've been trying to say.
It's just love, that's what it is.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.640
Because how else can we survive?

22:12.720 --> 22:14.840
It's impossible.
We're all just little babies.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.520
We all need to be set free.

22:16.840 --> 22:17.960
I know how.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.840
I know how to do it
without killing everyone.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.400
I know how to do it.

22:21.720 --> 22:22.920
'Cause I'm the <i>Auserwahlte.</i>

22:23.000 --> 22:25.680
It's not Bertha, it's not Felix,
it's not you because you're too weak.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.440
But I can do it. I can do this.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.200
I can take this-- It's the fucking music.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.560
It's the music, that's the spell,

22:32.680 --> 22:34.360
that's what's going to break the curse.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.440
It's what I've been doing all along.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.120
It's like the heaven in the heat
of darkness. It's the same thing.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.600
I can do this. I can save us.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.400
I can save you, Dad.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.680
I know how to do that.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.280
I can take this hell
and I can turn it into heaven.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.400
I can do that.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.640
I'm going to do that.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.240
Then the curse will be gone.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.920
