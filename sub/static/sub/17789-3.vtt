We read your plans
to take over the school,

09:54.814 --> 09:56.917
and we know all about
your evil happy camps!

09:56.950 --> 09:58.118
What do you mean,
evil?

09:58.151 --> 09:59.519
I want to become
school president

09:59.552 --> 10:01.587
so I can help those students
who feel a bit down

10:01.621 --> 10:05.058
and offer them a chance to go
to the Lake Camp at weekends.

10:05.091 --> 10:07.193
Oh. Oh, right.

Yeah, sorry.

10:15.068 --> 10:16.402
But your plan
was so convincing.

10:16.436 --> 10:18.204
You could have definitely
pulled it off.

I guess all that's left to do

10:19.906 --> 10:21.942
