Hi, Doc.

01:22.167 --> 01:24.109
I was just a fucking kid
when you people...

01:24.150 --> 01:26.319
I didn't know what they'd do, I swear.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.730
Bullshit.

01:29.058 --> 01:31.123
God damn it, I have a family now!

01:31.156 --> 01:33.111
We deserve a chance at a normal life.

02:02.482 --> 02:05.257
So, I hear you have a son.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.725
Uh?

03:00.979 --> 03:02.281
<i>Oui.</i>

03:45.623 --> 03:46.591
Dad!

03:52.563 --> 03:54.320
Hi.

03:57.468 --> 03:58.937
- H-how did you...
- I don't know.

03:58.971 --> 04:00.605
- How are you here?
- I... I don't...

04:00.639 --> 04:01.674
Fuck, I don't know.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.376
Did Lucas drop you off?

04:03.408 --> 04:04.977
- I don't think so.
- Well...

04:05.009 --> 04:06.846
- Is there anybody here?
- What the hell happened?

04:06.878 --> 04:08.647
- Are you okay?
- He was...

04:10.049 --> 04:12.385
- I was in his trunk, and then...
- What?

04:12.418 --> 04:13.953
I had... yeah, I had, like, a seizure,

04:14.003 --> 04:15.689
- and I, like, blacked out and...
- Henry, Henry.

04:15.714 --> 04:16.622
- Fuck, I don't know.
- Henry.

04:16.654 --> 04:17.922
I don't know what's happening to me!

04:17.956 --> 04:19.458
Okay, well, we gotta call the police.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.060
Jenna, we cannot call the police!

04:21.093 --> 04:23.795
Do you think that I can
explain this to the police?

04:23.829 --> 04:25.876
I can't explain that.

04:38.377 --> 04:40.038
It's your mom.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.784
Oh.

04:43.081 --> 04:45.317
Oh, fuck, I have an appointment.

04:45.350 --> 04:48.586
- You should tell her, okay?
- I cannot... I can't tell her.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.923
At least about Clay.

04:50.956 --> 04:52.992
I have to go.

05:09.675 --> 05:11.610
What're you doing?

05:11.642 --> 05:13.411
Uh...

05:13.444 --> 05:16.581
Sorry, I... I... I was just, uh, um...

05:16.714 --> 05:19.617
- Did you get in an accident?
- Uh, no.

05:19.651 --> 05:21.853
- Not really, I... I... I...
- "Not really"?

05:21.887 --> 05:26.625
Okay, there...
Okay, okay, there... there...

05:26.658 --> 05:29.395
There... there was this girl,
and she was with Clay

05:29.427 --> 05:32.398
before his wreck, and I thought
she might know something,

05:32.430 --> 05:34.666
but she... she wouldn't
even talk to me, so I... I... I...

05:36.401 --> 05:38.294
Okay, I put her in the trunk
of the car, and then now...

05:38.325 --> 05:40.114
You put a girl in the trunk of your car?

05:40.161 --> 05:41.807
I know how that sounds,
but I didn't have any other choice.

05:41.839 --> 05:44.376
- Stop, just stop.
- Look, Pop.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.078
I will get her to talk,
just give me another chance.

05:46.110 --> 05:49.147
I don't give a shit about some girl.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.050
Your brother is in a coma,
for Chrissakes.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.419
You saw his truck. No girl did that.

05:53.868 --> 05:56.389
- It was those fuckers up north.
- The Millers?

05:56.422 --> 05:58.524
We lost their product at the border.

05:58.557 --> 06:00.759
That doesn't come without a price.

06:00.785 --> 06:02.520
Well, then let me help.
I can go to Canada, I...

06:02.560 --> 06:03.561
No.

06:03.595 --> 06:05.030
You wanna help?

06:05.062 --> 06:07.399
You stay with your brother
in the hospital.

06:07.432 --> 06:08.735
Yeah, but...

06:10.134 --> 06:12.038
Okay, yes, sir.

06:20.719 --> 06:22.955
No, no, no. Oh, God.

06:23.214 --> 06:25.784
These red lights. Ugh.

06:27.185 --> 06:29.521
I can't believe Gregg would
only give me an hour break.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.725
He knows how important this is.
He has kids.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.704
Do you know he spells
his name with three Gs?

06:34.767 --> 06:35.906
Gregg, with three Gs.

06:35.931 --> 06:37.429
One in the beginning, two at the end.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.898
Who does that?

06:38.930 --> 06:40.598
Someone you can't trust, that's who.

06:41.104 --> 06:42.612
At least we got into this doctor.

06:42.651 --> 06:43.876
There was like a crazy long wait,

06:43.901 --> 06:45.571
I could barely get in, you know...

06:57.458 --> 07:00.864
Henry, are you okay?

07:05.089 --> 07:07.105
Henry?

07:07.192 --> 07:09.394
Honey, you're sweating.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.232
Yeah.

07:13.310 --> 07:16.546
Yeah, I'm just...
I think I need some air.

07:19.605 --> 07:24.075
I was just wondering
if certain things can...

07:24.276 --> 07:26.045
trigger seizures.

07:26.077 --> 07:27.245
Like what?

07:27.278 --> 07:28.980
Um...

07:30.281 --> 07:32.084
Like, if...

07:32.117 --> 07:35.020
Like, if somebody gets close to me,

07:35.052 --> 07:39.057
or if I'm in a confined space.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.253
I'm... I'm sorry, I don't think
I understand what you mean.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.493
It's just that I've had se...

07:43.661 --> 07:46.231
two other seizures since

07:46.298 --> 07:48.600
I went to the ER, and they f...

07:48.626 --> 07:51.971
- felt pretty different from the others.
- Different how?

07:52.004 --> 07:54.573
Like I blacked out or something.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.541
Um...

07:56.583 --> 07:58.852
Or at least that's how it felt to me.

07:58.877 --> 08:00.545
Like I...

08:00.579 --> 08:02.747
Like I lost time.

08:02.772 --> 08:05.976
And then when I came out of it,
I was in a different place.

08:06.017 --> 08:09.521
First of all, there is no
scientific evidence to suggest

08:09.555 --> 08:12.557
that claustrophobia or touch
can incite seizures.

08:12.591 --> 08:14.293
I believe that what you have is called

08:14.326 --> 08:17.271
mesial temporal sclerosis, or MTS.

08:17.326 --> 08:18.763
It's a very common condition,

08:18.797 --> 08:20.199
which causes a variety of symptoms,

08:20.232 --> 08:23.102
one of which is mild
memory and time loss.

08:23.134 --> 08:26.038
So essentially everything
that you described is normal,

08:26.071 --> 08:28.550
for patients with MTS.

08:28.607 --> 08:29.775
Oh.

08:29.807 --> 08:31.776
So, uh, what...

08:31.810 --> 08:33.645
what's next? What do we do?

08:33.678 --> 08:35.581
Well, we begin with new medication,

08:35.614 --> 08:37.615
something that will actually manage

08:37.649 --> 08:38.918
your seizures and blackouts

08:38.951 --> 08:40.586
and get your life back to normal.

08:40.619 --> 08:41.921
How does that sound?

08:41.953 --> 08:43.889
Yeah, that sounds great.

08:51.150 --> 08:54.595
Okay, um...

08:54.932 --> 08:57.735
Hope this'll be enough. Here.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.004
Why don't you take that?
Now, just go ahead

08:59.037 --> 09:00.639
and take all this too, okay?

09:00.672 --> 09:02.675
Yeah, that's fine, I'm sure.
Thanks, Mom.

09:02.707 --> 09:05.076
I'm sorry I don't have time
to go in with you.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.312
It's just a prescription.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.279
Hey, wait, are you hungry?

09:08.312 --> 09:10.182
Do you wanna come
by the diner for a snack?

09:10.215 --> 09:11.917
I can make you maybe a Shirley Temple.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.018
Remember how you used to love those

09:13.051 --> 09:14.984
when you were a little girl?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.623
The pharmacy's gonna close soon.

09:17.655 --> 09:18.656
- Okay.
- So...

09:18.690 --> 09:19.725
Yeah, okay.

09:19.758 --> 09:20.965
All right, well, just, um,

09:21.012 --> 09:22.860
remember Thomas will
come and pick you up.

09:22.894 --> 09:24.176
Okay.

09:24.261 --> 09:28.191
Hey, this town's not so bad, right?

09:28.699 --> 09:30.869
Sure.

09:30.902 --> 09:34.040
I read somewhere that
happiness is a state of mind.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.078
Okay.

09:40.111 --> 09:41.646
What do you mean, "Okay"?

09:41.679 --> 09:44.149
I don't know, I've gotta go.

- Hey, Henry.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.185
My mom told me that
you'd give me a ride home.

10:20.217 --> 10:23.389
How was your appointment?

10:23.422 --> 10:25.057
Fun.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.326
Uh, all right.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.663
Uh, I got a pin stuck on lane eight.

10:30.688 --> 10:32.699
Do you mind giving me a hand?

10:33.398 --> 10:35.301
Come on, then we can go.

10:37.369 --> 10:38.935
Lane eight.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.918
Can you pass me that
little wrench in my toolbox?

10:57.822 --> 10:59.158
Thanks.

11:01.793 --> 11:04.525
Deputy Hulce paid me another visit.

11:04.796 --> 11:07.041
She's got it in her head
that you called in

11:07.125 --> 11:10.119
Clay Boone's accident from the scene.

11:10.501 --> 11:12.455
That's...

11:12.621 --> 11:13.697
really weird.

11:13.736 --> 11:16.008
I have no idea why she would think that.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.776
I told her the same thing.

11:17.808 --> 11:21.746
I also ditched all those car
parts I found in your closet.

11:21.779 --> 11:23.682
I hope that's okay.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.086
Were you hurt?

11:29.187 --> 11:31.395
Good.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.725
Henry...

11:35.192 --> 11:38.931
Bill Boone is not somebody
that you wanna mess with.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.767
He's gonna do whatever it takes
to protect his family.

11:41.799 --> 11:43.735
Do you understand?

11:50.241 --> 11:52.276
Sir, you got a minute?

11:52.309 --> 11:56.013
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about Eddie Max.

11:56.047 --> 11:58.016
A number of witnesses confirm
he was at The Lodge

11:58.048 --> 11:59.518
the night of Clay Boone's accident.

11:59.551 --> 12:01.019
You know, the dressing just sits

12:01.052 --> 12:03.288
right on top of the lettuce.

12:03.313 --> 12:05.093
The doctor says I got gout, you know.

12:05.147 --> 12:06.258
No more red meat.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.360
- Have you tried shaking it?
- Hmm?

12:08.393 --> 12:10.537
If you close your lid
and shake your salad,

12:10.608 --> 12:12.178
the dressing will mix right in.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.350
No shit.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.467
So, I took it upon myself to check

12:16.500 --> 12:18.269
Henry Cole's cell phone records

12:18.302 --> 12:20.272
and cross-referenced them
with cell towers.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.373
Yeah, don't... don't, uh...
don't do that.

12:22.407 --> 12:24.726
- Excuse me?
- Don't take it upon yourself.

12:24.796 --> 12:27.044
It's not that I don't
appreciate your tenacity.

12:27.077 --> 12:31.250
I mean, you're a real
modern-day Angela Lansbury.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.884
You know who that is?

12:32.918 --> 12:35.156
- I... I do, yeah.
- She's a very talented woman.

12:35.181 --> 12:36.487
She'll probably outlive us all.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.517
But I said that the case was
closed, and I meant it.

12:40.057 --> 12:41.783
I suggest

12:42.193 --> 12:44.862
you put more energy into
making friends around here.

12:45.462 --> 12:47.332
That'll serve you better.

12:54.038 --> 12:56.953
Hey. Is my dad coming in?

12:57.475 --> 12:59.945
Um, no, he just dropped me.

13:01.017 --> 13:03.120
Have you eaten anything yet?

13:03.248 --> 13:05.457
I've... made myself soup.

13:05.831 --> 13:09.368
Who makes themselves soup?

13:09.486 --> 13:11.189
People like me, I guess.

13:11.222 --> 13:14.425
That's so weird, Jenna.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.828
Did you talk to the doctor
about what's been going on?

13:16.861 --> 13:18.615
Yep.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.678
So what'd he say?

13:20.950 --> 13:25.588
Basically that everything
is normal, you know,

13:25.636 --> 13:28.492
for someone with my condition anyway.

13:28.873 --> 13:30.975
Even the blackouts?

13:31.142 --> 13:33.045
Yeah, he's got me on these new meds

13:33.077 --> 13:35.320
that are gonna fix everything.

13:35.521 --> 13:37.100
Just like that?

13:37.315 --> 13:38.550
Just like that.

13:38.582 --> 13:40.451
Did you talk to your mom?

13:40.485 --> 13:42.053
About what?

13:43.488 --> 13:45.124
Clay.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.777
No, Jenna, I did not.

13:49.059 --> 13:52.630
Look, if you don't wanna talk
to your mom, or me,

13:52.663 --> 13:54.098
Planned Parenthood has
a hotline you could call...

13:54.131 --> 13:56.386
What're you doing?

13:56.634 --> 13:58.537
I'm trying to help you.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.474
Don't.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.705
Henry.

14:05.309 --> 14:07.643
Henry, you were sexually assaulted.

14:09.246 --> 14:11.569
I liked it better when we didn't talk.

17:34.484 --> 17:36.121

17:36.146 --> 17:37.594
It'd make me feel better

17:37.685 --> 17:39.054

17:47.724 --> 17:49.426

17:49.484 --> 17:51.934
Don't mention it.

17:53.471 --> 17:55.441

17:58.242 --> 17:59.577
Uh...

17:59.611 --> 18:02.277
Uh, listen, we should go.
Now, honey, come on.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.737
What is this?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.248
Oh, um...

18:36.314 --> 18:39.384
It's paint. It's spray paint.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.240
Mm.

18:41.318 --> 18:43.505

20:52.791 --> 20:57.197
Patty, Clay cheated on you. Like, a lot.

20:57.275 --> 20:58.990
Jesus, Jenna, I know that.

20:59.022 --> 21:01.587
But he's on life support or something.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.573
Have a heart.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.807
You're right. I'm... I'm sorry.

21:07.354 --> 21:09.556
We need to get our stories straight.

21:09.666 --> 21:11.035
About?

21:11.068 --> 21:13.179
What you did the other day.

21:13.336 --> 21:15.405
I don't wanna get you in trouble.

21:16.941 --> 21:18.543
What're you talking about?

21:18.576 --> 21:20.778
The event.

21:20.811 --> 21:23.048
Principal Paige wants to talk
to us about what happened

21:23.080 --> 21:24.961
in Dr. Gibson's class.

21:25.435 --> 21:27.437
- Mister.
- What?

21:27.518 --> 21:29.019
Nothing.

21:29.053 --> 21:31.323
It's important you know
I would never reveal the truth

21:31.355 --> 21:32.824
about your telekinesis.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.858
- Townes, I've...
- It's true.

21:34.892 --> 21:36.861
I have nothing to gain
by exposing your secret.

21:36.894 --> 21:38.896
I come from an
upper-middle class family,

21:38.930 --> 21:40.820
so the undoubtedly hefty
financial reward

21:40.851 --> 21:42.382
for selling you to the government

21:42.445 --> 21:44.868
or some nameless, faceless
multinational corporation

21:44.902 --> 21:46.604
- doesn't interest me.
- Townes, stop.

21:46.636 --> 21:49.405
I just get seizures sometimes. I mean...

21:49.522 --> 21:52.334
Like, it sucks, but I... That's it.

21:52.370 --> 21:55.540
There's nothing special about me.

21:57.414 --> 21:59.394
What?

21:59.483 --> 22:01.847
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

22:01.919 --> 22:04.753
Every super-powered individual
experiences this sort of

22:04.800 --> 22:07.032
pessimistic attitude
before they learn to accept

22:07.057 --> 22:08.961
their powers.

22:09.026 --> 22:11.496
But we still need to determine
whether you're a superhero

22:11.528 --> 22:13.531
or a super villain.

22:14.030 --> 22:16.067
Bye, Townes.

22:16.099 --> 22:18.555
It could go either way.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.745
I got nothing to do with this, I swear.

22:26.778 --> 22:28.913
You dumped hundreds
of thousands of dollars

22:28.945 --> 22:30.781
worth of product down a drain.

22:30.815 --> 22:32.417
I had no choice.

22:32.450 --> 22:34.018
Border Patrol was inspecting the truck.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.721
You were bringing
a truckload of cars from Canada

22:36.753 --> 22:38.923
into America without a passport.

22:38.955 --> 22:40.457
But I didn't hit Clay's truck.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.692
I didn't do that.

22:41.726 --> 22:43.161
No.

22:43.193 --> 22:45.129
You just caused our partners
enough money

22:45.163 --> 22:48.165
that they felt inclined
to cripple my son.

22:51.169 --> 22:54.267
Look, I'm sorry, Bill, honest.

22:54.471 --> 22:56.462
But I would never hurt Clay.

22:56.707 --> 22:59.017
I can make it up to you.

22:59.383 --> 23:01.306
Why do you think you're here?

23:01.913 --> 23:03.615
What?

23:04.882 --> 23:07.697
I want justice done for my son.

23:07.984 --> 23:09.687
You owe me.

23:53.412 --> 23:55.414
So, uh...

23:55.493 --> 23:57.095
I don't know any good jokes.

23:57.167 --> 24:01.105
You were always better at
remembering that kind of stuff.

24:03.140 --> 24:04.709
But I should talk to you, right?

24:04.741 --> 24:06.810
In case you can hear me.

24:31.234 --> 24:35.541
Shit, you're a popular
motherfucker, that's for sure.

24:35.839 --> 24:38.609

24:38.643 --> 24:41.179

Bill Boone.

25:37.233 --> 25:39.420
Nice to meet you.

25:44.141 --> 25:46.709
I saw you walking and I said to myself,

25:46.978 --> 25:49.295
"I have to thank her."

25:49.846 --> 25:51.889
If you hadn't called in Clay's accident,

25:52.016 --> 25:54.334
doctors might not have
got to him in time.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.355
Say, what're you doing right now?

25:57.387 --> 25:59.724
I could really use your help
with something.

26:00.391 --> 26:02.857
You know, I'm actually walking home.

26:03.027 --> 26:05.684
I've got a lot of homework to do, so...

26:06.230 --> 26:07.999
Very sorry about Clay, Mr. Boone.

26:08.031 --> 26:10.134
Hey.

26:11.868 --> 26:13.337
Hold up a second.

26:13.371 --> 26:14.939
You and Clay were close, right?

26:14.971 --> 26:17.041
I mean, that's why
he helped you, isn't it?

26:18.976 --> 26:20.945
You know this...

26:20.978 --> 26:22.279
Baby runs pretty well,

26:22.313 --> 26:24.382

26:26.049 --> 26:27.968

26:28.419 --> 26:31.202
I'll have you back before you know it.

26:31.895 --> 26:33.331
Please?

26:37.094 --> 26:38.673
Um...

26:45.769 --> 26:47.539
Yeah, okay.

26:47.704 --> 26:49.139
Thanks.

27:03.319 --> 27:05.067
Seat belt.

27:05.321 --> 27:06.924
Right.

27:21.005 --> 27:22.373
- What're you doing here?
- Hi.

27:22.405 --> 27:24.207
Well, I just figured,

27:24.240 --> 27:25.977
even though you're working
late, doesn't mean we can't

27:26.009 --> 27:27.943
enjoy a meal together.

27:27.978 --> 27:30.381
- And the food here sucks.
- Keep your voice down.

27:30.413 --> 27:32.416
All right, I can set up
a table in the back.

27:32.450 --> 27:35.224
Um, ok... okay?

27:35.885 --> 27:37.525
- Iris, do you mind if I take my break?
- Go for it.

27:37.588 --> 27:39.123
- Just a little early? Okay.
- I can take those.

27:39.155 --> 27:41.658
- Um, okay. Thank you.
- Go. Okay.

27:43.089 --> 27:45.025
What is that?

27:45.128 --> 27:48.331
I tried to make a swan,
but I guess it, you know,

27:48.365 --> 27:50.801
turned out more like a...
like, maybe a duck,

27:50.835 --> 27:53.438
- or a... or a dog.
- I was gonna say llama.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.272
- 'Cause of the...
- Well, yeah.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.842
At least that llama
has warm bread inside.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.242
- What?
- Yeah, buddy.

27:59.276 --> 28:01.653
- Mmm.
- And...

28:01.817 --> 28:04.404
I managed to snag us a couple of beers.

28:04.481 --> 28:06.317
- Good man.
- Here's to you.

28:06.349 --> 28:08.185
Oh. Thank you for this.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.716
You're welcome, my pleasure.

28:10.788 --> 28:13.825
- Is this sauce homemade?
- Um...

28:13.857 --> 28:15.025
You made this yourself?

28:15.058 --> 28:16.499
Well, Paul Newman made that sauce.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.328
- Oh.
- Right before he died.

28:18.362 --> 28:20.850
Thank you, Paul.

28:20.931 --> 28:23.267
Mmm. It's good.

28:23.343 --> 28:24.969
Good.

28:29.973 --> 28:31.908
You know, Henry acts like these new meds

28:31.942 --> 28:33.773
are gonna cure her,
but the neurologist never made

28:33.798 --> 28:35.011
those kind of promises.

28:35.045 --> 28:36.881
And then I looked up MTS on WebMD,

28:36.913 --> 28:38.482
and it says that it could get worse.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.118
And if it does,
it could require surgery.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.366
I mean, what if something
is really, really wrong with Henry?

28:42.389 --> 28:43.354
I don't know what I would do.

28:43.394 --> 28:45.733
And then she... Henry just
acts so tough, you know?

28:45.789 --> 28:47.892
She's always putting up these
walls, but I know she's scared.

28:47.924 --> 28:49.493
I can tell it. I know she is.

28:49.527 --> 28:52.028
- God knows I am, I mean...
- Cleo.

28:52.061 --> 28:55.198
Whatever it is, whatever she needs,

28:55.231 --> 28:57.394
okay, we will take care of it.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.304
Henry is in good hands.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.980
Won't be too long now.

29:16.820 --> 29:19.198
Mr. Boone, I should probably get back.

29:19.448 --> 29:22.401
Just 'cause I think
my mom will be worried.

29:23.059 --> 29:25.362
You call her if you want to.

29:29.432 --> 29:32.901
Don't worry, I don't plan on
telling her what happened.

29:33.871 --> 29:35.940
I was a teenager once too.

29:36.058 --> 29:37.962
Smoking dope and having sex.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.755
I get why you don't want anyone
to know you were with Clay.

29:41.034 --> 29:43.739
Kind of a double standard
for girls, isn't it?

29:52.235 --> 29:54.422
Oh, hold on.

29:54.978 --> 29:56.852
Shortcut.

30:10.173 --> 30:12.309
You know, when Clay was nine,

30:12.343 --> 30:14.478
he and Lucas were messing
around in the backyard.

30:14.510 --> 30:16.270
Climbing that big oak.

30:16.346 --> 30:18.348
Clay fell from one of
the branches, broke his arm.

30:18.382 --> 30:19.606
It was gruesome.

30:19.631 --> 30:21.152
I mean, the bone was sticking out.

30:21.184 --> 30:22.645
So I scooped him up.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.239
I put him in the truck to
take him to Emergency, right?

30:25.288 --> 30:26.624
Well, the kid won't shut up.

30:26.656 --> 30:29.495
I mean, he is wailing
like a little girl.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.730
So I stop.

30:36.634 --> 30:38.448
I stop the truck.

30:40.604 --> 30:42.001
And I said,

30:42.619 --> 30:45.939
"Look at it. Look at your bone."

30:47.411 --> 30:49.212
You should've seen the
expression on his face.

30:49.246 --> 30:51.859
Kind of the way you're
looking at me right now.

30:51.926 --> 30:53.161
But I tell him,

30:53.250 --> 30:54.726
"We're not going to the hospital,

30:54.786 --> 30:56.875
"until you do what I say."

30:58.164 --> 31:01.886
So finally he turns and looks at it.

31:02.159 --> 31:04.929
And again, he starts
screaming and crying.

31:06.583 --> 31:09.688
But I say to him, "Clay,
underneath this shit,

31:09.761 --> 31:12.827
"we're all just a sack of bones.

31:13.569 --> 31:16.632
"Not a lot of people get to see
the stuff underneath.

31:17.441 --> 31:20.624
"Now is your chance to take
a look at what you got

31:21.118 --> 31:23.153
"and decide

31:23.476 --> 31:26.645
what's gonna separate you
from the other guys."

31:29.953 --> 31:32.512
He stopped crying right then and there.

31:33.104 --> 31:35.442
Nine years old and he got it.

31:35.659 --> 31:37.520
That's strength.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.919
Stop!

31:44.535 --> 31:45.702
We're here.

31:45.736 --> 31:48.139
Mr. Boone, um...

31:48.172 --> 31:50.525
These men are business
associates of mine.

31:50.588 --> 31:53.347
They sell me used cars
from time to time.

31:53.635 --> 31:55.546
Stay put.

32:06.457 --> 32:08.192
Fuck.

32:17.768 --> 32:20.104
Okay, we're all set.

32:24.173 --> 32:27.562
Mr. Boone, I should
probably call my mom now.

32:27.644 --> 32:30.320
These men that
I work with are Mennonites.

32:30.415 --> 32:33.297
I'm hoping you'll recognize
one or two of them.

32:33.889 --> 32:35.491
I don't understand.

32:35.555 --> 32:38.489
All you have to do is tell me
which one of them attacked Clay.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.803
And then we can go.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.394
Oh, no, no, no, no.

32:43.444 --> 32:45.395
I... I didn't see anything like that.

32:45.429 --> 32:47.198
It's... it's okay. Calm down.

32:47.230 --> 32:49.165
I... I really didn't see
anything like that.

32:49.199 --> 32:52.382
I don't even remember what happened.

32:54.771 --> 32:56.531
Put your hood up.

33:15.358 --> 33:17.912
- Mr. Boone, can...
- Pay attention now.

33:42.385 --> 33:44.438
Procedures in place...

33:44.488 --> 33:46.557
Of course.

34:00.809 --> 34:03.077
So?

34:05.541 --> 34:07.546
I don't... I don't know.

34:08.072 --> 34:11.210
Look, you and I,

34:11.398 --> 34:13.596
we're on the same team. You know that.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.549
- I'll protect you.
- But I d...

34:17.464 --> 34:19.399
I... I don't... I don't remember.

34:19.456 --> 34:20.556
- Yes, you do.
- I really... I really...

34:20.590 --> 34:22.431
Yes, you do.

34:22.726 --> 34:26.319
Look at me. Look at me.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.233
I know you're afraid.

34:29.929 --> 34:32.654
So am I. For Clay.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.614
If I could talk to him, I...

34:35.752 --> 34:38.155
If I could ask him
what happened, I would.

34:38.235 --> 34:40.121
But I can't.

34:40.510 --> 34:45.356
I can't because one of these
men put him in the hospital.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.435
It's not Clay's fault.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.099
My boy didn't do anything wrong.

34:51.487 --> 34:54.286
It's mine. It's my fault.

34:54.358 --> 34:56.547
And I need to make it right.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.750
You care about my son, right?

35:00.831 --> 35:04.013
So tell me which one
of these men hurt him?

35:05.943 --> 35:07.513
I...

35:07.637 --> 35:10.974
Was it the one with
the money bag, in the plaid?

35:11.541 --> 35:13.476
Or the one with the black hat
in the center?

35:13.510 --> 35:15.555
He calls the shots around here.

35:16.613 --> 35:18.249
Look, you have to remember.

35:18.304 --> 35:19.844
- I... I...
- You have to.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.039
Come on.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.372
Um, I...

35:30.268 --> 35:32.192
It could...

35:32.623 --> 35:36.497
It could be the first one.
The... the... the young one.

35:36.581 --> 35:38.857
The one in the plaid, but I'm...

35:39.177 --> 35:41.171
But I'm really... I'm really not sure,

35:41.204 --> 35:43.099
so I can't be positive.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.576
But you think so?

35:50.213 --> 35:51.834
Well,

35:52.538 --> 35:55.466
we should keep this trip between us.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.742
It'd be better for everyone
involved, don't you think?

36:10.300 --> 36:12.536
You have any idea
how fast you were going?

36:12.605 --> 36:14.784
Uh, no, Officer. No, I don't.

36:14.871 --> 36:16.807
It's just 'cause you can go over 100

36:16.859 --> 36:19.023
doesn't mean that you should.

36:27.366 --> 36:29.436
<i>For some time now, the science community</i>

36:29.522 --> 36:32.585
<i>has known that genetic
mutations cause disease...</i>

36:32.663 --> 36:35.280
<i>If we know what mutations...</i>

36:43.369 --> 36:45.100
Fuck.

36:46.402 --> 36:48.371
What're you doing?

36:48.405 --> 36:50.574
- Thank fuck.
- Where have you been?

36:50.606 --> 36:51.775
Get out of my room.

36:51.807 --> 36:53.610
Henry, you've been gone for hours.

36:53.643 --> 36:55.789
Jenna, I can't right now, so...

36:55.828 --> 36:57.328
What happened? Henry, tell me...

36:57.375 --> 37:00.351
Jesus Christ, Jenna, can you
just worry about your own shit

37:00.384 --> 37:01.885
for one second, and just

37:01.918 --> 37:04.521
fucking leave me the fuck alone?

37:04.554 --> 37:07.291
Jesus, I'm sure Patty has some
dress that she's, like,

37:07.324 --> 37:08.826
fucking dying to show you.

37:08.858 --> 37:11.867
Yeah, she probably does.

37:12.896 --> 37:15.750
But I'm not leaving you alone right now.

37:18.501 --> 37:22.972
So, whatever you wanna do, let's do.

37:35.485 --> 37:37.688
You don't smoke that much, do you?

37:38.119 --> 37:41.133
First time.

37:42.378 --> 37:44.656
- Mm.
- What?

37:45.996 --> 37:48.953
Jenna, you've never smoked,
but you'll...

37:49.231 --> 37:51.200
you drink this shit?

37:51.257 --> 37:53.563
Only sometimes.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.930
It tastes like Pop Rocks.

37:56.072 --> 37:57.974
No, give it to me.

37:58.007 --> 37:59.710
Ah, Flamingo Pink.

37:59.742 --> 38:02.880
Oh, and you're so cool?
Look at your stupid graffiti.

38:03.065 --> 38:05.729
"Fuck this, fuck everything."

38:12.456 --> 38:14.091
Okay.

38:18.561 --> 38:20.605
You know, this used to be, um...

38:20.664 --> 38:23.120
this used to be my mom's workshop.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.503
She made all our clothes up here.

38:28.505 --> 38:32.266
She tried to teach me to sew, but...

38:34.478 --> 38:36.780
I thought it was stupid.

38:38.114 --> 38:40.272
So...

38:41.020 --> 38:43.323
You know, like two minutes
after she died,

38:43.420 --> 38:45.733
I threw up.

38:46.922 --> 38:49.375
All over her bed.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.596
I felt so bad.

38:53.630 --> 38:56.672
She was... she was still
lying there, and I...

38:58.436 --> 39:01.122
I just couldn't keep it all
in anymore, you know?

39:02.339 --> 39:04.674
It was too much.

39:08.010 --> 39:10.748
Henry, whatever Clay did to you...

39:10.826 --> 39:12.915
- I...
- I...

39:13.416 --> 39:16.947
I don't really know what he did, so...

39:17.079 --> 39:18.755
Okay.

39:18.789 --> 39:20.724
Okay, but I... I still think...

39:20.757 --> 39:22.629
And he might not even wake up.

39:22.692 --> 39:25.058
You know? So...

39:25.695 --> 39:28.293
Everything will just be...

39:39.141 --> 39:40.877
I hope he dies.

39:44.473 --> 39:46.175
That's fucked up.

39:46.215 --> 39:48.184
Not if it's what you feel.

39:51.121 --> 39:54.425
Look, I know he's
in the hospital, but just...

39:55.925 --> 39:58.862
Don't... don't let him
get away with it, okay?

40:00.831 --> 40:02.833
No matter what.

40:17.514 --> 40:18.882
Ms. Coles.

40:18.924 --> 40:20.683
- Oh. How embarrassing.
- Hi.

40:20.717 --> 40:22.586
I must look like
a total caffeine addict.

40:22.619 --> 40:25.838
If I don't have at least two
cups a day, I'm a monster.

40:25.889 --> 40:27.346
Hey, do you have some time

40:27.391 --> 40:29.861
to talk about Henry and Clay Boone?

40:31.728 --> 40:34.427
Um, sure.

40:34.852 --> 40:36.154
What's up?

40:42.105 --> 40:43.789
Henry.

40:44.206 --> 40:46.422
Principal's office, I'm afraid.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.203
Right.

41:01.992 --> 41:04.862
I just went.
They didn't suspect a thing.

41:04.894 --> 41:06.829
They?

41:27.016 --> 41:29.552
Hey, hey, Clay, Clay.

41:29.585 --> 41:31.621
Clay, hey, Clay.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.624
Uh, excuse me, hey,
my brother's choking.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.892
- I... I... um...
- Step outside, sir.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.293
Step outside of the room. Thank you.

41:36.326 --> 41:37.961
Excuse me, sir.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.032
Got it?

41:46.851 --> 41:48.882
It must've been troubling

41:48.972 --> 41:50.941
experiencing a seizure in class.

41:50.974 --> 41:54.116
It was pretty awful for both
of us, wasn't it, Ms. Coles?

41:57.681 --> 42:01.284
But, outside of that, you must admit

42:01.318 --> 42:04.731
that you are a disruptive
presence in the classroom.

42:05.129 --> 42:07.629
I... I do see potential in you, though.

42:07.824 --> 42:10.788
And I wanna help you. I really do.

42:10.927 --> 42:16.272
So, I'm sorry for any part I
may have played the other day,

42:16.632 --> 42:18.968
but I believe that it
would be better for everyone

42:19.001 --> 42:21.596
if we just moved on from this.

42:21.871 --> 42:23.510
Don't you agree?

42:25.641 --> 42:28.244
- Better for everyone.
- That's right.

42:33.349 --> 42:35.208
Um...

42:36.052 --> 42:40.537
You know, I'm not really sure
if that's true.

42:40.657 --> 42:44.836
'Cause I, for one, am not
really ready to move on.

42:45.228 --> 42:49.531
Not since you inappropriately
put your hands on me in class.

42:49.699 --> 42:52.101
Equally inappropriate was
the bullying of a student

42:52.135 --> 42:55.909
with autism who doesn't know
how to defend himself, which,

42:55.972 --> 42:58.775
since we're being honest,
is how this incident began.

42:58.807 --> 43:01.311
- Excuse me, but...
- Dr. Paige, can I ask you,

43:01.370 --> 43:05.014
um, how are we expected
to conduct ourselves

43:05.047 --> 43:08.018
with an example like Mr. Gibson,

43:08.083 --> 43:10.252
who claims that he has a doctorate

43:10.314 --> 43:12.330
when he really does not?

43:12.381 --> 43:13.623
I swear to God... You with this again?

43:13.664 --> 43:15.099
- I just have to wonder what kind
- Do you see what she's doing here?

43:15.186 --> 43:17.404
of example this sets
for the youth of America.

43:17.467 --> 43:18.770
You know?

43:18.795 --> 43:21.798
Lie and you will be put
in a position of power?

43:21.831 --> 43:24.041
Take advantage of those
who you deem weaker than you

43:24.080 --> 43:25.100
and you will be rewarded?

43:25.135 --> 43:27.137
Okay, this is absurd.
You're 16 years old!

43:27.170 --> 43:28.372
- Mr. Gibson!
- What gives you the right

43:28.405 --> 43:29.737
- to come in here and...
- Please!

43:32.007 --> 43:34.106
Thank you for your candor, Ms. Coles.

43:34.177 --> 43:37.692
And I assure you, appropriate
action will be taken.

43:41.177 --> 43:44.046
I appreciate that, Dr. Paige.

43:47.456 --> 43:49.109
Thank you for your time.

Henry.

44:13.333 --> 44:14.692
Clay woke up.

44:27.832 --> 44:29.814
You okay?

44:29.955 --> 44:32.334
I can't... I can't... I can't...

44:32.367 --> 44:34.439
I can't breathe.

44:38.273 --> 44:39.809
Jenna, get back.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.167
No, no.

45:14.934 --> 45:16.909
No, fuck.

45:33.295 --> 45:34.830
What is this?

45:34.864 --> 45:37.114
Oh, um...

45:37.175 --> 45:38.343
It's paint.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.114
- It's spray paint.
- Oh.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.782
Have I seen your work?

45:43.869 --> 45:46.037
I don't know.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.987
Maybe.

45:59.355 --> 46:02.429
Hey, I think...

46:02.748 --> 46:05.171
I think I should go.

46:07.932 --> 46:10.581
Okay, yeah.

46:10.871 --> 46:12.106
Okay?

46:12.202 --> 46:13.643
Yeah, I can take you home.

46:13.734 --> 46:15.803
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

46:18.074 --> 46:20.210
