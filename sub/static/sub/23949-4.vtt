WEBVTT

00:05.705 --> 00:07.906
Cheers to...

00:08.009 --> 00:08.707
Brunching.

00:08.809 --> 00:09.408
The weekend.

00:09.510 --> 00:09.942
Adulting.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.543
Adulting.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.947
Did we make... oh, did
we make eye contact?

00:15.049 --> 00:15.647
Bad luck.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.749
Bad luck.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.150
So how are you and Jackson?

00:18.252 --> 00:19.485
We're doing really well.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.788
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.756
Really well.

00:23.858 --> 00:24.957
Really well.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.625
It's a step up, guys, from what it was.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.461
I'm actually going to
get together with Bryant.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.031
I have a bunch of lyrics, and
I've just been talking to him,

00:32.133 --> 00:34.333
and he's like, well, I
have these song ideas.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.602
So we're going to finally
get together and see

00:36.704 --> 00:38.170
if we can blend it, or...

00:38.272 --> 00:41.240
Is this one of your first
writing sessions, kind of?

00:41.342 --> 00:42.374
Yeah.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.909
It's something that I've
been trying to avoid,

00:44.011 --> 00:44.943
like having to co-write.

00:45.046 --> 00:45.677
Why?

00:45.780 --> 00:47.212
I don't know.

00:47.314 --> 00:52.184
Because I think it terrifies
to have to share my deepest,

00:52.286 --> 00:53.552
darkest secrets with a stranger.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.354
You have to be vulnerable
with your audience.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.523
I mean, I'll be vulnerable
with the people out there,

00:57.625 --> 00:59.558
but I don't want to be
vulnerable with this stranger

00:59.660 --> 01:00.159
that's right here.

01:00.261 --> 01:00.726
That seems weird.

01:00.828 --> 01:01.560
Why?

01:01.662 --> 01:02.961
I don't know.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.297
We're going to find out if I can
do it and kinda get used to it.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.565
It's different with a co-writing,

01:06.667 --> 01:09.568
though, because that is the deep stuff.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.636
You know?

01:10.738 --> 01:11.904
And I feel like, I'm
not just going share

01:12.006 --> 01:13.172
my world with some stranger.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.673
I don't know you.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.041
Well, maybe you start with
the people that you know.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.576
Like, maybe we could write together.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.044
Yeah.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.045
Are you OK?

01:20.147 --> 01:20.646
Yeah.

Mom, I am so nervous.

01:41.936 --> 01:46.538
You could be Miss Tennessee
in 48 hours, going to Miss USA.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.641
I mean, just knowing the
stories that you've told me

01:49.743 --> 01:51.577
and when you were Miss
Tennessee, just growing

01:51.679 --> 01:53.512
up, and hearing the stories,
and seeing the clothes,

01:53.614 --> 01:54.513
and all the pictures.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.381
And I can't think about anything else

01:56.484 --> 01:59.818
that would be just more neat
for any mother/daughter to have

01:59.920 --> 02:00.953
in common from the same state.

02:01.055 --> 02:01.620
I know.

02:01.722 --> 02:02.521
I know.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.889
That would be unusual.

02:03.991 --> 02:04.957
Whenever I think about it,
my heart just starts beating.

02:05.059 --> 02:06.125
No, it is scary.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.726
Because years ago, a girl could have

02:07.828 --> 02:10.461
their makeup artist and
their hair stylist backstage.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.964
And there's nothing like that...

02:12.066 --> 02:12.965
There's nothing.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.633
So tease, hairspray.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.467
Tease, hairspray.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.168
Tease, hairspray.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.002
Asphyxiate yourself.

02:17.104 --> 02:17.803
Asphyxiate myself.

02:17.905 --> 02:18.804
Yes.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.072
You've got to stay focused.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.207
But when it comes down to it,

02:22.309 --> 02:26.345
I've worked so hard, but there
is nothing that will compare

02:26.447 --> 02:28.180
to how nervous I am right now.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.049
I know you're nervous, but I also

02:31.152 --> 02:32.818
know you're going to
do great this weekend.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.986
I'm ready for it.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.087
And I'm ready for a party.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.455
Oh my gosh.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.189
Why not?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.223
I'm not even there yet.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.324
I'm not even there.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.693
We're having a major celebration.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.795
I'm serious.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.899
I want friends, I want
family, I want the supporters.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.133
And it's going to be wonderful.

02:48.235 --> 02:51.069
And even if I lose, maybe, too.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.504
Mm, I don't know about that.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.277
♪ And for the first
time, I'm waking up. ♪

03:01.682 --> 03:02.347
♪ And for... ♪

03:02.449 --> 03:03.582
I loved your party.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.483
That place is so cool

03:04.585 --> 03:05.184
It is so cool.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.451
That was kind of...

03:06.554 --> 03:07.286
You were so good on stage, though.

03:07.388 --> 03:07.853
That was so cool.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.755
Thank you.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.822
Did you enjoy meeting Ally and everyone?

03:10.925 --> 03:11.857
Yes.

03:11.959 --> 03:12.624
Thank you for bringing her.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.759
Absolutely.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.028
Actually, I mean, the
whole pageant thing,

03:16.130 --> 03:17.462
she's going to have a party.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.997
Her mom is going to throw her one.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.332
If you'd like to come...

03:20.434 --> 03:21.667
Your whole family is going to be there?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.335
It'll be my family,
it'll be her friends,

03:23.437 --> 03:24.236
people that have been important
in her life, you know.

03:24.338 --> 03:24.870
Like your mom, and...

03:24.972 --> 03:25.938
Yeah.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.706
Can I bring Alisa and Rachyl?

03:27.808 --> 03:28.540
Of course you can.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.008
Yeah, absolutely.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.043
Oh my word.

03:31.145 --> 03:32.044
This is so pretty.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.011
I know, it's been great.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.213
Yeah.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.681
Thank God it's a nice day outside.

03:35.783 --> 03:36.782
You never know here.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.183
It's raining one day
it's sunny the next.

03:38.285 --> 03:41.153
The weather's so unpredictable.

03:43.891 --> 03:44.923
I've had fun with you.

03:45.025 --> 03:45.557
Yeah?

03:45.659 --> 03:46.592
Mhm.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.427
I really enjoy hanging out with you.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.829
This is just a very, very
different thing for me.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.499
Well, you have been really
cool about taking things slow.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.634
Of course.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.902
I'm Team Take-It-Slow.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.470
Team Take-It-Slow.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.004
Awesome.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.172
Very good.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.082
Try not to spill them, OK?

04:10.184 --> 04:11.283
Look at that mess.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.184
Cheerios everywhere.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.552
No, not the airplane.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.188
There's a hurricane
in here this morning.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.189
OK, let's get dressed.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.923
Here.

04:19.026 --> 04:19.524
Come here.

04:19.627 --> 04:19.925
Mommy.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.293
Ooh.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.528
Will you help put his
shirt on before you go?

04:23.631 --> 04:24.196
Here.

04:24.298 --> 04:24.930
Hey bud, come here.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.232
Stand up.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.068
Hey, you're not standing up.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.703
Ready?

04:31.805 --> 04:32.604
Arms up.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.171
Push.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.173
There it is.

04:35.276 --> 04:35.941
Go down.

04:36.043 --> 04:36.908
Good job.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.144
Yeah, he's going to work.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.912
He's going to wear his boots.

04:41.015 --> 04:42.881
When are you going
to come to work, buddy?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.116
You want to go to work?

04:44.218 --> 04:45.817
I'll stay home, eat Cheerios all day.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.819
Love you, honey.

04:47.921 --> 04:48.620
Bye, Wolfgang.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.955
Say "bye, Dada."

04:50.057 --> 04:51.690
Bye, Dada.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.292
Bye-bye buddy.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.826

I'm trying to make
this coffee over here.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.384
I've never used this kind of machine,

05:52.486 --> 05:53.952
but we're going to see how it works.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.454
It's just a normal coffee maker.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.722
If it's really gross...

05:56.824 --> 05:58.690
So I had a date with Jackson yesterday.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.159
He was so funny at our birthday.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.794
He's got that Southern charm, which

06:02.896 --> 06:06.331
could be good, if it's
genuine, or it could be a trap.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.166
And you don't know until you find out.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.468
Right.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.769
Which I think you can
only find out with time.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.970
His cousin was cute.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.004
Gorgeous.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.072
Mm.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.941
And she does pageants too, yeah?

06:16.043 --> 06:16.875
Mhm.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.143
I was like, yeah, I see.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.678
I see pageant written all over this.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.147
She's in the Miss Tennessee pageant.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.181
It's happening tonight.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.149
That's where Jackson is.

06:24.251 --> 06:24.983
Sarah's there too.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.752
Can we watch it?

06:26.854 --> 06:27.886
Eh, I mean...

06:27.988 --> 06:28.887
There has to be some...

06:28.989 --> 06:30.255
I'm not watching that.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.823
It would be a cultural experience.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.559
Y'all don't think that's kind
of weird for me to creep on his

06:34.661 --> 06:35.794
cousin and...

06:35.896 --> 06:37.262
She's putting herself
out there to be creeped on.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.331
It says here that we could stream it.

06:39.433 --> 06:39.898
We can watch it.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.032
That's fine.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.033
Yes.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.403
Are y'all ready for tonight?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.372
We'll get the party started

thing I've ever seen.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.737
Where is she?

07:18.839 --> 07:21.473
We begin with Nashville's Megan Miller.

Is this turning you on?

08:52.733 --> 08:57.002
Three women remain, however,
only one will wear the crown.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.103
Let's continue.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.038
The second runner-up to the title

09:00.140 --> 09:05.577
of Miss Tennessee USA,
Greater Nashville's
Savana Hodge.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.383
I'm having a panic attack.

09:11.485 --> 09:12.417
Oh my gosh, this is kind of exciting.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.952
This is the winner, right here.

09:14.054 --> 09:14.853
OK.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.520
It's time.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.122
Only two women left.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.724
Only one will be at the top,
wearing that beautiful crown.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.927
Ladies, you're in position.

09:22.029 --> 09:22.961
Good luck.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.829
The judges have made their decision.

09:24.932 --> 09:29.534
One of these ladies is about to
become Miss Tennessee USA 2018.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.303
Oh, they're announcing first runner-up?

09:31.405 --> 09:32.304
Yes.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.038
So that means...

09:33.140 --> 09:34.539
Second place.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.907
And the runner-up for
Miss Tennessee USA is North

10:12.579 --> 10:14.512
I mean, it's just surreal.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.482
There's nothing to even
describe this feeling.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.618
I've never worked so hard
to actually win something.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.987
You do realize that your life will never

10:23.223 --> 10:25.223
You're just as much to thank
as anyone else, seriously.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.027
You did everything that
I asked you to do and more.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.462
Well, thanks.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.530
I mean, it's been great,
and it's still so surreal.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.965
So what's next?

10:34.067 --> 10:37.435
My mom is so excited
about throwing this party.

I mean, with all of the...

10:38.605 --> 10:40.205
So she's going to do it big?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.039
Yes.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.440
She has to, though.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.608
I mean, yeah.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.909
You only win Miss Tennessee one time.

really close friends, family,

10:54.287 --> 10:56.521
and a few, actually, of my
friends from the pageant.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.524
Including my friend Savana
I heard you had your eye on.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.525
Oh yeah.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.826

11:26.653 --> 11:27.552
Thank you.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.689
Go give it to him.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.925
Just what I needed, lip gloss.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.060
Thank you.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.162
Babe, I don't think
he's had a lot to eat,

11:37.264 --> 11:39.064
so give him a big dinner.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.031
Mama!

11:40.133 --> 11:40.465
Mama!

11:40.567 --> 11:41.399

11:41.501 --> 11:42.834
Did you hear me, honey?

11:42.936 --> 11:43.868
Mama.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.104
You said order him a pizza and beer.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.072
Yeah, that's fine.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.006
Just make sure he eats.

11:48.108 --> 11:48.540
OK.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.310
Do you think he likes
heavy beer or light beer?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.547
Are y'all going out after,
or you just doing that?

11:55.649 --> 11:57.115
I don't know.

11:57.217 --> 11:57.682
All right.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.888
Dang.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.023

You clean up nice.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.205
Thank you.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.707
This is a little different than...

13:29.810 --> 13:30.341
Not in my frat t-shirts
and all that good stuff.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.209
Yeah.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.010

13:39.953 --> 13:41.152
I've heard a lot about you, too.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.253
I probably haven't heard everything,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.421
but I have heard a lot.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.956
Well that's hopefully all good.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.572
You're the sweetest person in the world.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.840
I see where you get your charm.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.074
No, don't say that.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.476
Mine is too!

14:05.579 --> 14:07.378
Whoa! You just told on yourself.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.112
I'm kidding.

14:08.215 --> 14:08.680
I'm kidding.

14:08.782 --> 14:09.247
I'm kidding.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.883
Hey, y'all.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.685
First, I want to thank
you all for coming out

14:13.787 --> 14:17.322
to celebrate Alexandra representing

14:17.424 --> 14:19.257
our great state of Tennessee.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.562
You know, you've heard that old saying,

14:24.664 --> 14:27.065
it takes a village to raise a child?

14:27.167 --> 14:31.569
It takes more than that
to be a state winner!

14:31.671 --> 14:33.605
Thank you so much for being my mom...

14:33.707 --> 14:35.106
I love you.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.976

15:19.653 --> 15:20.885
What happened?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.287
Your face is telling
me it's not good news.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.588
What?

15:23.690 --> 15:24.989
Are you OK?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.425
I got a text message a few days ago.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.126
Mhm.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.060
From who?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.561
Well, you remember when...

15:30.664 --> 15:31.796
OK.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.264
So Kerry and I got married, and then

15:33.366 --> 15:36.968
we were separated for awhile,
and he wanted a divorce.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.670
And we didn't together,
blah, blah, blah.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.737
And I was...

15:39.839 --> 15:41.239
I hooked up with that guy, J.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.407
Oh my gosh.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.708
He texted you?

15:43.810 --> 15:44.976
What?

15:45.078 --> 15:48.713
He just said, do you
still live in Nashville?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.181
So...

15:50.283 --> 15:50.815
So...

15:50.917 --> 15:52.317
Did you respond?

15:52.419 --> 15:53.451
Yeah.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.486
Why?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.460
Are you going to tell Kerry?

16:02.562 --> 16:03.728
I don't know.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.830
You know, I just even feel badly that I

16:05.932 --> 16:07.432
wanted to hang out with him.

16:07.534 --> 16:14.405
But if it's eating you up, can
you live with not telling him?

16:14.507 --> 16:17.442
Yeah, I do feel like
I'm being dishonest.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.943
But you guys are both musicians.

16:19.045 --> 16:23.314
If you don't know what it's
like to be the other half,

16:23.416 --> 16:26.017
waiting at home while
your partner's on the road

16:26.119 --> 16:27.518
all the time, never home.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.087
And, like, what?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.421
Then your partner just gets home,

16:30.523 --> 16:33.491
and you're like, oh, by
the way, my ex texted me.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.093
That's so not fair.

16:35.195 --> 16:35.893
Like...

16:35.996 --> 16:39.230
Rache, you are a good wife.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.498
Come here.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.101
Your marriage is stronger
than some guy who's

16:43.203 --> 16:44.335
coming up out of the blue.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.503
I don't know that.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.137
It is.

16:46.239 --> 16:46.804
It is.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.339
How do you guys know?

16:48.441 --> 16:50.041
Because this isn't the
first thing you've dealt with.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.311
And it's not the last thing
you're going to deal with.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.569
Same.

17:21.141 --> 17:25.777
Why is this girl talking
to Jackson so heavy?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.345
It's fine.

17:27.446 --> 17:28.311
No, it's not fine.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.714
It's fine.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.417
She's too pretty to be having that long

17:32.519 --> 17:35.553
of a conversation with him.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.756
You think he's going to
ask her if he can kiss her?

17:38.858 --> 17:40.158
I don't know, you guys.

Next time on Music City...

18:30.477 --> 18:31.776
Were you trying to hurt her?

18:31.878 --> 18:33.010
Absolutely not.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.146
You need to figure out what you want.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.248
I didn't know that I hurt Kerry so much.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.118
I think y'all are strong
enough to handle this.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.719
I kind of messed up.

18:41.821 --> 18:45.323
What are you going to do if
he keeps contacting Rachyl?

18:45.425 --> 18:46.491
Then we've got problems.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.527
Maybe one day I'll be good enough.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.196
Do you like me?

18:52.298 --> 18:56.534
I really do think
you're the perfect girl.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.802
But...
