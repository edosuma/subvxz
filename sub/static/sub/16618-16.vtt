10:19.753 --> 10:21.586
Maybe you<i> should </i>
miss school.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.455
I have perfect attendance.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.390
You can't get that back!

10:25.392 --> 10:28.126
Okay, I'll bring your
carriage around.

10:29.630 --> 10:33.131

10:38.972 --> 10:40.271

10:46.947 --> 10:48.947

10:48.949 --> 10:51.983

D'oh!

11:11.805 --> 11:15.440
Mr. Burns, I noticed no one ever
puts suggestions in the box.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.676
So I took the liberty
of making my own.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.512
Hmm.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.113
Yeah.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.654

11:29.656 --> 11:31.456
You've done

Working out issues.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.870

11:45.872 --> 11:47.639

11:51.912 --> 11:54.012
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.680
It means, young lady,

11:55.682 --> 11:58.850
that you're about to go
to the head of the line.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.386
Whoa, whoa, whoa. If everyone
has a cut-the-line pass,

12:01.388 --> 12:03.755
<i>no one</i> has a cut-the-line pass.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.524
LISA: Quit your whining!
I'm riding the ride!

in the dictionary.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.390

12:39.392 --> 12:41.693
You've never said "no."

12:41.695 --> 12:43.428
Hmm? Hmm.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.697
Hmm.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.232
Oh!

12:47.234 --> 12:50.602
Honey, I'm really sorry,
but I'm here for you every way.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.203
Except physically.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.239
Also, spiritually
and emotionally.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.741
And I've never been good
at zipping up dresses.

12:56.743 --> 12:57.942
What are you saying?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.745
Men have accomplished
unbelievable things

13:00.747 --> 13:02.947
when they've denied
themselves whoopee.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.983
The pointy pyramids of Egypt,

13:04.985 --> 13:07.752
the Duomo, which I now know
is a thing.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.721
You don't name
a company "Microsoft"

13:09.723 --> 13:11.089
when you're getting some.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.557
Oh, boy.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.593
First the kids are screwed up,
and now our marriage is?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.095
We need therapy.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.798
(eerie theremin music plays)

13:19.800 --> 13:22.634
I said "therapy,"
not "theremin."

13:22.636 --> 13:23.935
Honest mistake.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.637
Or was it?

13:25.639 --> 13:28.640
(eerie music plays)

13:28.642 --> 13:30.809
MASTERS:
<i> Welcome, Marge.</i>

13:30.811 --> 13:33.111
Homer, no need
to take your pants off.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.413
It's not what you think.
I just had a big lunch.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.482
Just a series of questions
for now.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.650
<i> Then</i> the pants
come off.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.118
Now, let me be blunt.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.687
Are you happy with
your romantic life?

13:42.689 --> 13:45.690
My problem used to be
too much satisfaction.

13:45.692 --> 13:46.791
We hear that a lot.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.626
But I'm afraid
not so much lately.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.962
Do you self-gratify?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.932
Yes. I do everything
but masturbate.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.935
You know, this all started
with our poor kids traumatized

13:56.937 --> 13:58.970
by a budget
summer camp.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.673
So many perfect marriages
ruined by kids.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.775
We tell them it's
not their fault,

14:03.777 --> 14:06.344
when, of course, it's
always their fault.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.113
What you must do is return
your children to this camp

14:09.115 --> 14:10.815
and face down their demons.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.483
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

14:12.485 --> 14:15.320
There's so much more you can do
when you don't think about sex.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.388
That's why nuns
are so successful.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.524
You have to take the kids
back to that camp.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.059
Well, it beats
hanging out with them.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.529
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have some deviants coming in.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.864

Hello? Anybody here?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.332
Yeah, I brought my lady.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.133

14:29.135 --> 14:30.568

14:43.149 --> 14:45.783

<i> I've always wanted,</i>

14:51.491 --> 14:53.258

15:27.594 --> 15:29.761

15:29.763 --> 15:31.596
Oh, uh, Krusty
cut his losses

World Family Entertainment.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.105
Uh-oh. Did I leave

Why don't you kids go in here,
and we'll find someone

15:43.610 --> 15:45.743

that what you think happened

15:45.745 --> 15:47.211
didn't happen.

get naked?

15:49.215 --> 15:51.783

In which case,
