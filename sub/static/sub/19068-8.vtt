WEBVTT

00:01.006 --> 00:03.062
<i>Previously on Dracula...</i>

00:03.063 --> 00:04.726
General Shaw is innocent.

00:04.736 --> 00:06.693
I didn't destroy the man.
You did.

00:06.694 --> 00:08.053
Jonathan's not here.

00:08.054 --> 00:11.477
I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding
another partner to dance with.

00:11.531 --> 00:13.628
I love you, Mina.

00:13.739 --> 00:16.186
Ehm... you need to leave.

00:16.202 --> 00:18.227
Someone should
teach her such pain.

00:18.228 --> 00:22.565
I will teach you
how to haunt Jonathan's dreams.

00:22.599 --> 00:25.446
I conducted an experiment
by adding this substance

00:25.447 --> 00:29.115
to human cheek cells,
and the dead cells reanimated.

00:30.542 --> 00:34.509
Ladies and gentlemen, this machine
is a threat to public safety.

00:34.510 --> 00:37.309
The Order burnt
my wife and children.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.460
You will have your revenge.

00:39.494 --> 00:41.562
When we crush them,
we both will.

00:41.596 --> 00:44.533
With your serum,
I can walk in the sun.

00:44.534 --> 00:47.897
But it will only allow you
four hours in daylight.

00:47.898 --> 00:50.612
- What would people say?
- What people?

00:50.613 --> 00:52.699
Your hands are trembling.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.677
So who do you love most,
Alexander Grayson?

01:15.373 --> 01:16.473
No!

01:26.106 --> 01:27.512
No!

01:39.679 --> 01:42.613
Sir, may I ask a question?

01:42.614 --> 01:45.199
If I told you no,
would it stop you?

01:45.568 --> 01:46.735
Probably not.

01:48.237 --> 01:51.220
How long do you
intend to sit here?

01:52.611 --> 01:54.677
- Sir...
- I allowed a question.

01:54.711 --> 01:56.788
That does not mean
I wish to answer it.

01:56.889 --> 01:59.307
There is folly
in this obsession.

01:59.627 --> 02:01.778
Folly and threat.

02:01.954 --> 02:04.656
If you want the girl,
then take her.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.640
But if you cannot have her,
then walk away.

02:06.641 --> 02:07.907
Enough.

02:09.502 --> 02:12.624
"Take her, or walk away."

02:13.506 --> 02:16.026
If only it was that easy.

02:16.301 --> 02:19.938
The first would put Mina
in mortal danger.

02:20.043 --> 02:22.153
But the second...

02:22.648 --> 02:25.288
That would be the end of me.

03:29.685 --> 03:34.859
- Father. What are you doing here?
- I've come to grab you away.

03:35.205 --> 03:37.656
I don't work this late
and I actually am a physician.

03:37.657 --> 03:39.257
I just... I have a few more
things that I...

03:39.258 --> 03:42.380
Hiding here, avoiding me,
avoiding Jonathan.

03:42.381 --> 03:45.426
- I'm not avoiding anyone.
- No, no. Let me speak.

03:47.332 --> 03:50.013
What is the American to you?

03:57.687 --> 04:00.687
I love Jonathan.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.851
I have known him
my entire life, and...

04:03.852 --> 04:06.174
Well, he's like family to me.

04:07.376 --> 04:10.377
He will be my husband,
and I will be his wife.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.382
But, tell me, Mina.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.777
But Alexander...

04:17.095 --> 04:19.750
He exerts a kind of...

04:19.750 --> 04:21.430
Magnetic force.

04:21.464 --> 04:25.113
And no matter how hard I try,
I can't...

04:27.366 --> 04:31.682
- I sound like a fool.
- No, not at all.

04:33.909 --> 04:37.059
I loved one woman in my life.

04:37.810 --> 04:41.466
But my path to your mother
was hardly a straight line.

04:42.841 --> 04:46.811
So I did the only possible thing
when it comes to happiness.

04:48.749 --> 04:51.710
I followed my heart.

04:56.933 --> 05:01.797
Blackheath, bow,
Islington, and Chelsea.

05:01.891 --> 05:05.061
Four. Tracked and exterminated
this last evening.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.296
Good God.

05:06.330 --> 05:09.124
We can only draw
one inescapable conclusion.

05:11.168 --> 05:14.170
How can you deny it?
The signs are clear.

05:14.205 --> 05:16.783
There is another
elder vampire in London.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.501
But you said
you'd killed the old one.

05:20.644 --> 05:23.751
I did.
But the plague continues.

05:23.752 --> 05:26.936
Where the old one goes,
the sons and daughters follow.

05:26.937 --> 05:28.784
There is another one.

05:34.057 --> 05:35.991
Then go.

05:36.426 --> 05:39.428
Find it and destroy it.

05:54.443 --> 05:57.065
- Lovely night, ain't it?
- It is now.

05:57.152 --> 05:58.699
First time,
by the looks of you.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.082
- How can you tell?
- Not to worry...

06:01.083 --> 06:03.418
Ladybird'll take care
of everything.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.163
Oh! Bloody hell!

06:26.685 --> 06:28.903
So the rumors are true.

06:29.413 --> 06:31.803
A proper huntsman.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.449
- And a woman, too.
- It's time to die.

06:35.483 --> 06:38.418
Too late.
Already dead.

07:03.611 --> 07:05.444
Who called you?

07:05.756 --> 07:07.747
- Our master.
- Name.

07:07.781 --> 07:10.998
- He has many.
- I'm not a fan of riddles.

07:13.886 --> 07:16.422
- Name.
- He will destroy me.

07:16.456 --> 07:19.153
- Name.
- The Fell One.

07:19.212 --> 07:20.379
Liar.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.929
Vlad Țepeș.
Vlad the Impaler.

07:23.963 --> 07:25.097
Dracula.

07:25.132 --> 07:27.666
- It cannot be.
- We swarm to do his bidding.

07:27.676 --> 07:30.678
- Together, we will make an endless night.
- Where's his nest?

07:30.737 --> 07:32.881
Tell me!

07:33.405 --> 07:35.273
I'll tell you everything.

08:05.673 --> 08:08.249
Season 1, Epsiode 8
"Come to Die"

08:08.273 --> 08:11.273
Synced by err0001 & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

08:11.285 --> 08:14.612
- I'm in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

08:17.198 --> 08:19.842
Swear to me
this stays between us.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.943
I swear I will tell no one.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.374
The story about Shaw
was a complete fabrication.

08:27.408 --> 08:30.443
What about the evidence?
His financial records...

08:30.478 --> 08:33.124
Faked.
Every shred of it.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.589
- Why would you do such a thing?
- I didn't.

08:36.956 --> 08:38.549
I didn't.
It was Grayson.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.063
- He engineered the whole thing.
- So retract it.

08:41.123 --> 08:44.159
I can't. Grayson was too
clever to get his hands dirty.

08:44.193 --> 08:47.265
There must be someone
who can corroborate your story.

08:47.266 --> 08:49.169
- The bookkeeper?
- She's gone.

08:50.054 --> 08:53.546
She's disappeared into thin air.
No one's seen her in days.

08:54.273 --> 08:56.648
You think Grayson
might have...

08:57.084 --> 08:58.789
You know...

08:59.441 --> 09:02.700
- What?
- Made her disappear?

09:04.875 --> 09:08.686
- Yes.
- Do you think you're in danger?

09:09.724 --> 09:11.684
Yes, I do.

09:13.711 --> 09:15.743
Then here.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.020
Take this.
You may need it.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.935
You've outdone yourself.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.226
I never thought you'd
be stupid enough to slaughter

09:24.227 --> 09:26.227
Chief Inspector
of Scotland Yard.

09:26.228 --> 09:30.477
- I wanted the truth and I got it.
- Yes, I'm certain you did.

09:30.980 --> 09:34.992
He told me the entire plot.
They poisoned all those people.

09:34.993 --> 09:37.310
It's the Order of the Dragon.
It surprises you?

09:37.311 --> 09:39.616
It proves our technology
had nothing to do with it.

09:39.617 --> 09:40.951
It doesn't matter.

09:40.952 --> 09:43.820
The Order made it look
like it was our resonator.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.539
In the public's eye,
it is unsafe, deadly.

09:46.540 --> 09:50.397
That is all they know
and all they will remember.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.994
Even if the technology
is proven blameless.

09:53.995 --> 09:56.697
It's finished.
We are ruined.

09:56.795 --> 09:58.877
And what do you suggest
we do about it?

09:58.878 --> 10:00.212
Give up?

10:00.366 --> 10:02.111
After all our hard work?

10:02.112 --> 10:05.752
No, I'm not giving up.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.418
- I will have my revenge.
- You will have your revenge when I...

10:24.066 --> 10:25.300
Ready?

10:26.865 --> 10:28.232
What were you saying?

10:28.233 --> 10:30.871
You were saying we will prove
the technology is harmless

10:30.872 --> 10:32.739
and continue as planned.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.307
Yes.

10:35.244 --> 10:36.410
Yes.

10:41.921 --> 10:46.139
- Dracula is a myth.
- A tale told to frighten children.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.656
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- Be quiet, both of you.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.920
You believe me, don't you?

10:55.425 --> 10:57.297
He was a man.

10:57.927 --> 11:00.701
His name was Vlad Țepeș,
Vlad the Impaler.

11:00.702 --> 11:05.806
He was a medieval warrior prince renowned
for his savagery and ruthlessness.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.375
He was master huntsman
in his native land,

11:08.409 --> 11:12.279
and he served on the High Council
of this very organization.

11:12.313 --> 11:14.521
- This is absurd.
- It's ridiculous.

11:14.522 --> 11:17.193
She's right.
There was such a man.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.718
The texts concerning him
are forbidden to all

11:19.719 --> 11:21.498
but the Dragon's heads
and their chief huntsmen.

11:21.499 --> 11:24.558
He defied the Ordo Draco,
was excommunicated by the Church

11:24.592 --> 11:26.626
and found guilty of heresy.

11:26.661 --> 11:31.598
So grievous was his sin that a sentence
of death was considered inadequate.

11:31.632 --> 11:35.635
So they employed occult rituals
and transformed him

11:35.670 --> 11:37.704
into the living demon
that we now know

11:37.738 --> 11:41.340
as the Fell One, Nosferatu,
primo Master vampire,

11:41.374 --> 11:42.709
Dracula.

11:42.743 --> 11:46.079
Created, not sired,
by us.

11:46.113 --> 11:48.480
What proof do you have
that he's in London?

11:48.515 --> 11:51.617
He swatted off
my seers like flies.

11:51.651 --> 11:54.152
He easily bested Kruger, one
of the most formidable huntsmen

11:54.187 --> 11:56.121
I've ever had
under my command.

11:56.155 --> 11:58.056
He's avoided detection.

11:58.091 --> 12:01.893
He's infested London with
creatures answering his call,

12:01.928 --> 12:04.183
and finally, last night,

12:04.497 --> 12:06.332
one of them
explicitly named him.

12:06.366 --> 12:09.101
And I presume it would
do the same before the Council.

12:09.102 --> 12:10.473
Well, she would.

12:10.474 --> 12:12.618
Had she not taken my weapon
and blown her own head off.

12:12.619 --> 12:14.724
How very convenient.

12:15.525 --> 12:17.285
He's right, of course.

12:17.601 --> 12:19.344
Your suspicions may be true,
but we cannot

12:19.378 --> 12:21.713
rely on the word
of one of those creatures.

12:21.748 --> 12:25.115
Bring us proof.
<i>Compelling</i> proof.

12:25.251 --> 12:27.818
It's the only way
such a claim can be believed.

12:27.853 --> 12:30.187
If Dracula's in London, sir,
I will find him.

12:30.222 --> 12:32.467
I will end him
once and for all.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.823
Jonathan.

12:49.010 --> 12:50.790
You agree...

12:51.181 --> 12:54.251
That there should be
no secrets between us?

12:54.551 --> 12:56.087
Yes.

12:59.173 --> 13:00.953
It's Grayson.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.175
What about him?

13:07.512 --> 13:09.612
He lied to my face,

13:09.959 --> 13:14.145
in order to destroy
the reputation of General Shaw.

13:14.146 --> 13:15.999
- But Jonathan, you said that...
- Please, Mina.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.867
Just please, listen to me.

13:17.902 --> 13:20.436
Grayson blackmailed
Lord Laurent,

13:20.470 --> 13:23.539
and now Laurent's dead, as is young
Davenport, and by his own hand.

13:23.540 --> 13:24.841
That's not what
the papers said.

13:24.842 --> 13:27.510
He will do anything
in the pursuit of his grand project.

13:27.511 --> 13:29.527
Blackmail, slander...

13:29.563 --> 13:32.182
- And for all I know, murder.
- Murder?

13:33.023 --> 13:35.688
He's the closest thing to evil
I've ever seen.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.622
Jonathan...

13:38.623 --> 13:40.765
- Mina...
- If this is true...

13:41.292 --> 13:44.359
Then why do you continue
in his employ?

13:45.696 --> 13:48.517
I have my reasons.

13:48.518 --> 13:50.079
- And good ones.
- No secrets.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.870
Please, just give me time,
and I will explain everything to you.

13:54.871 --> 13:56.923
But until then...

13:57.547 --> 14:01.099
Until then, you stay away
from Alexander Grayson.

14:03.746 --> 14:06.990
- I want to see her, Jenkins, let me in.
- Lady Jayne is traveling, sir.

14:06.991 --> 14:09.571
I know she's here.
Let me in.

14:09.572 --> 14:11.944
Jenkins, let him in,
please.

14:15.638 --> 14:19.427
Alexander, how lovely
of you to drop by.

14:19.729 --> 14:21.382
Thank you, Jenkins,
that will be all.

14:21.408 --> 14:23.809
- If you need me, just call.
- I will.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.313
Excuse me,

14:25.500 --> 14:28.022
I don't remember
inviting you in.

14:29.453 --> 14:32.002
We've never stood
on formality, have we?

14:32.007 --> 14:34.158
Why are you here,
Alexander?

14:34.458 --> 14:37.994
- You know why.
- Yes, yes I do.

14:44.552 --> 14:46.305
You win.

14:46.654 --> 14:48.589
I don't understand.

14:48.623 --> 14:51.187
It's over, Alexander.

14:51.401 --> 14:53.423
I'll admit it,
I have met my match.

14:53.461 --> 14:56.467
Is that what you want to hear?
You have bested me.

14:56.468 --> 14:59.769
Now, please, just go.

15:00.053 --> 15:02.213
I'm far too busy
to continue playing this game.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.647
Game?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.705
Oh, please, just stop.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.242
I risked my life
to protect yours.

15:09.277 --> 15:11.144
Yes, you did.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.379
And for the life of me,
I can't work out why.

15:13.414 --> 15:16.435
Your heart clearly
belongs to another.

15:18.504 --> 15:22.624
- When did you know?
- When you danced with her...

15:22.807 --> 15:25.427
At her engagement party.

15:28.528 --> 15:33.414
- Was it that obvious?
- To me, glaringly so.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.627
Mr. Grayson...

15:43.898 --> 15:48.650
It was always Mina, wasn't it,
when you were with me?

15:49.010 --> 15:50.443
No.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.812
You're lying.

16:06.141 --> 16:09.756
So, what have you
got to tell me?

16:09.757 --> 16:11.524
I found some men.

16:13.780 --> 16:17.602
These men, are they reliable?

16:17.885 --> 16:20.198
Mm-mmm,
very much so, yes.

16:20.453 --> 16:23.272
- For a price.
- Good.

16:24.457 --> 16:27.927
Now all you need to do
is introduce them

16:28.336 --> 16:30.203
to the lady in question.

16:30.863 --> 16:33.665
And how soon will I start
making these introductions?

16:33.699 --> 16:36.215
The sooner the better.

16:48.024 --> 16:52.274
- Who do I have to kill?
- May I suggest no one, sir?

16:52.662 --> 16:54.518
Perhaps just this once.

16:54.791 --> 16:57.165
If the truth won't
set the resonator free,

16:57.199 --> 16:59.584
perhaps someone's
excised heart will.

16:59.631 --> 17:02.642
I have the name of a bureaucrat on
the Board of Health, who I am assured

17:02.643 --> 17:05.906
will be most accommodating
for a very modest fee.

17:05.906 --> 17:10.056
Fine, bribe the worm.
A king's ransom, if you must.

17:10.479 --> 17:14.214
But if it doesn't succeed,
then we do it my way.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.295
Understood.

17:19.521 --> 17:23.243
Sorry, um,
the butler let me in.

17:23.525 --> 17:27.094
Miss Murray,
what a pleasant surprise.

17:27.190 --> 17:28.958
Renfield.

17:42.873 --> 17:46.509
- What's wrong?
- I've spoken with Jonathan.

17:46.614 --> 17:50.569
He seemed quite terrified.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.719
- By what?
- By you.

17:52.745 --> 17:54.671
That's preposterous.

17:54.672 --> 17:57.381
- Is it?
- Of course.

17:57.658 --> 18:00.193
You know me
as long as Jonathan has.

18:00.227 --> 18:02.723
- Do I terrify you?
- No...

18:02.801 --> 18:06.683
- But I don't know you as well.
- On the contrary, Miss Murray,

18:07.034 --> 18:10.633
I would venture that you know me
better than anyone else.

18:12.639 --> 18:14.273
Forgive me.

18:14.308 --> 18:17.036
I sometimes give voice to things
that are better left unsaid.

18:17.044 --> 18:20.650
No, don't apologize.
It's what I like most about you.

18:21.023 --> 18:24.265
Americans.
Your honesty.

18:24.266 --> 18:27.823
I will never lie to you.
You have my word.

18:28.855 --> 18:31.490
Why was Jonathan so upset?

18:31.525 --> 18:34.732
Mina, there are powerful men
who wish to stop me,

18:35.137 --> 18:39.718
but on occasion, I have to match their
ruthlessness, or the future will be lost.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.695
Make no mistake, Mina,

18:42.226 --> 18:45.037
Harker's proving to be
as ruthless as I am.

18:45.071 --> 18:46.470
On occasion, more so.

18:46.471 --> 18:48.702
- No, you're wrong.
- Am I?

18:49.975 --> 18:52.036
Jonathan was right.

18:52.412 --> 18:54.703
You infect people.

18:54.947 --> 18:59.918
You call it charm, but it's
all for your own self-interest.

19:00.730 --> 19:04.597
Jonathan and I
will not be used up by you.

19:12.164 --> 19:13.698
A proper English gentleman
must have

19:13.732 --> 19:15.533
a proper English waistcoat
on his wedding day,

19:15.567 --> 19:18.202
but first, one must select
the appropriate fabric.

19:18.236 --> 19:19.937
I have swatches.

19:19.971 --> 19:23.538
Lucy, I'm sure the swatches
are very important,

19:23.539 --> 19:25.881
but I really can't be
late for work, so...

19:25.882 --> 19:28.406
I don't care a damn
about the swatches...

19:32.149 --> 19:36.663
Then why... why are you here,
if not for the swatches?

19:39.457 --> 19:41.458
You'll think me a fool.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.401
Lucy...

19:54.027 --> 19:57.371
I came here because
I can't get you out of my mind.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.826
I keep my feelings close.
I always have.

20:08.384 --> 20:10.471
So much so, you seem
entirely unaware of them.

20:10.472 --> 20:12.782
How long have you...
when did you...

20:12.783 --> 20:17.524
I neither planned nor expected this,
and yet, here we are.

20:18.857 --> 20:20.627
You and me.

20:24.575 --> 20:26.198
Lucy...

20:26.617 --> 20:29.805
Whatever this is,
it will pass.

20:30.673 --> 20:35.473
It must, if only for Mina's sake.
Mina, whom we both love.

20:36.519 --> 20:39.614
You're right, of course. I only wish
I had your strength of character.

20:41.177 --> 20:45.086
Let's not speak of this again,
for Mina's sake.

20:46.161 --> 20:50.727
Yes, that is the only course
of action, I completely agree.

20:50.926 --> 20:52.627
One condition.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.495
Of course.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.753
A kiss to help me after.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.892
No, no, that's...
that's impossible.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.642
Do not deny me
this consolation.

21:05.176 --> 21:08.559
It's a small crumb to ease the pain
of all that I shall never have.

21:14.582 --> 21:16.837
One kiss.

21:19.758 --> 21:22.211
A kiss between friends.

21:24.292 --> 21:28.295
You're kind.
And you're generous.

21:35.035 --> 21:38.471
No, no, no, no. I cannot
break my promise to Mina.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.900
Mina.

21:41.442 --> 21:43.590
How happy you both must be.

21:43.683 --> 21:45.379
Always together,

21:45.380 --> 21:48.680
even when you're working at Carfax
Manor, she's always visiting you.

21:51.274 --> 21:53.075
What are you talking about?

21:53.109 --> 21:56.779
I saw her there yesterday,
last week as well.

21:56.935 --> 21:59.525
She does make a habit of it.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.814
It was you she was visiting,
wasn't it?

22:04.920 --> 22:07.827
Mina Murray judges me!

22:08.302 --> 22:12.776
She scorns me!
She will not forgive me!

22:13.429 --> 22:14.988
I want some blood.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.562
No.

22:21.770 --> 22:25.195
I can't let you leave
Carfax Manor, not like this.

22:28.310 --> 22:31.138
- Who will stop me?
- I will.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.483
I want blood!

22:35.517 --> 22:38.362
Renfield, for your own sake.

22:53.049 --> 22:55.334
Mina Murray's
taken root in you.

22:55.369 --> 22:58.471
Her existence only makes your
true nature harder to disguise.

22:58.506 --> 23:02.451
She makes you hate
the one thing you are - Dracula.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.479
But without Dracula, you can
never defeat the Ordo Draco.

23:09.049 --> 23:11.183
What am I supposed to do?

23:11.218 --> 23:14.699
Forget her or take her.

23:26.499 --> 23:29.367
I told you
to stay away from him.

23:29.402 --> 23:31.902
Yes, I know, but I was only
trying to uncover the truth.

23:31.905 --> 23:33.204
I told you the truth.

23:33.239 --> 23:35.073
Yes, of course,
but I wanted to know...

23:35.107 --> 23:36.968
And you take Grayson's word
over mine?

23:37.030 --> 23:38.276
No.

23:38.277 --> 23:41.379
This whole time, I tried not to see it,
and it was right in front of me.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.529
See what?

23:42.530 --> 23:45.083
- You and Grayson.
- How dare you.

23:45.374 --> 23:48.870
I went there to protect you,
and you assume the worst.

23:48.871 --> 23:50.113
And the time before?

23:50.114 --> 23:52.571
There was a phonograph,
for the dance at the hospital.

23:52.572 --> 23:55.075
- There's always a reason, isn't there?
- Yes, a very good reason.

23:55.076 --> 23:58.415
Or do you just invent them, so you have
an excuse to see him, to flirt with him?

23:58.416 --> 24:02.182
- No, I would never even...
- I don't believe you!

24:07.328 --> 24:09.117
I don't.

24:14.979 --> 24:16.750
For the last time,

24:16.751 --> 24:19.806
why must you make this
so difficult for yourselves?

24:32.720 --> 24:34.353
Where is he?

24:48.731 --> 24:50.498
It's holy water.

24:51.104 --> 24:54.006
- Are you thirsty?
- If you ask, I'll answer.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.009
- Where is Dracula?
- I don't know.

24:57.043 --> 25:01.399
No one sees him.
And they say he lives in the light.

25:02.516 --> 25:05.511
- That's impossible.
- It's what I hear.

25:05.542 --> 25:08.109
He has no need
for the blanket of night.

25:08.110 --> 25:11.239
For him, the sun
is just another star.

25:11.240 --> 25:16.440
Close or far away,
it makes no difference.

25:17.033 --> 25:21.355
- He has bested God.
- How?

25:21.738 --> 25:25.826
What does it matter how?
It is.

25:26.438 --> 25:31.003
You will fear his wrath
by day, by night,

25:31.004 --> 25:34.107
and you will never
see him coming.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.830
15 years
of meticulous planning,

25:49.831 --> 25:52.232
A fortune
developing a technology

25:52.233 --> 25:55.162
to undermine their
petroleum interests, wasted.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.858
- We still have options.
- Options?

25:57.859 --> 26:02.711
Professor, you really should take
a seat and try to calm yourself.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.515
Tell me you've made some
progress with these bureaucrats?

26:06.549 --> 26:10.285
Every contact we've had
has ignored our advances.

26:10.319 --> 26:13.190
It's as if we've been frozen out
from the top down.

26:13.761 --> 26:16.175
- This man, Browning...
- Browning?

26:16.176 --> 26:21.124
Yes, he seems to exert an iron grip
over London's political machine.

26:22.955 --> 26:25.424
He's on Mr. Grayson's
short list.

26:25.615 --> 26:29.809
Definitely High Council.
He may even be the Dragon's Head.

26:32.182 --> 26:33.882
No!

26:33.883 --> 26:37.201
Papa, papa, papa, papa!

26:38.750 --> 26:40.417
No!

26:51.993 --> 26:54.045
Do you know of him?

26:56.775 --> 26:59.589
No, I've never heard
of this man.

28:22.563 --> 28:24.241
Hello?

28:30.655 --> 28:32.563
What do you want?

28:33.276 --> 28:35.360
What are you doing here?

28:35.969 --> 28:37.704
Hello, Miss Murray.

28:38.149 --> 28:40.314
Quite a lovely night,
isn't it?

28:44.321 --> 28:46.416
- Now, now.
- Aah!

28:51.650 --> 28:53.773
I like a girl with spirit...

28:55.899 --> 28:58.349
But only to a point.

28:59.702 --> 29:03.555
Now, I'm assuming
that you've never seen

29:03.556 --> 29:06.809
what sulfuric acid
does to a body's face.

29:07.012 --> 29:11.340
It eats right through the skin,
just like...

29:13.483 --> 29:16.851
Fire through paper.

29:17.330 --> 29:19.988
Lips and lids...

29:20.186 --> 29:22.020
Burn right off.

29:22.147 --> 29:25.862
Turns the nose into nothing
but a couple of holes.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.971
Watch and learn, gents.

29:28.793 --> 29:30.966
Watch and learn.

30:32.258 --> 30:36.125
Vlad Țepeș.
Vlad the Impaler.

30:36.133 --> 30:38.267
Dracula.

30:49.853 --> 30:52.566
Her injuries
are largely superficial.

30:53.904 --> 30:56.540
She will be fine, Jonathan.

30:59.340 --> 31:03.920
- Who could have done this?
- I don't know.

31:10.713 --> 31:12.792
Will she recover?

31:14.335 --> 31:16.369
She will survive.

31:19.029 --> 31:20.791
Doctor.

31:34.494 --> 31:36.275
Mina.

31:37.057 --> 31:38.786
Mina.

31:42.156 --> 31:44.195
Who did this?

31:45.535 --> 31:47.002
Mina.

31:47.495 --> 31:50.841
It's important.
You must tell us everything.

31:51.972 --> 31:53.963
There were three men...

31:55.306 --> 31:58.418
And they attacked me
and held me on the table.

32:01.694 --> 32:05.165
It was so fast.
I can't... I can't remember.

32:05.194 --> 32:08.374
Who? Who did this?

32:08.737 --> 32:10.413
He had a bottle.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.121
- A bottle of acid.
- Oh, my God.

32:14.409 --> 32:19.330
And a birthmark,
a port wine stain on his face.

32:24.594 --> 32:28.091
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

32:29.531 --> 32:32.061
- The police.
- Yes...?

32:32.062 --> 32:35.179
They must be informed
immediately.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.484
Jonathan...

32:40.002 --> 32:42.213
- Harker!
- What do you want?

32:42.214 --> 32:44.866
I want the same thing
you do, justice.

32:44.867 --> 32:48.799
- I don't need your help.
- No, you don't.

32:50.189 --> 32:53.858
The man with the birthmark,
his name is Hackett.

32:54.089 --> 32:55.856
Hackett's Davenport's man.

32:56.352 --> 32:59.009
- I must alert the proper authorities.
- Alert them?

32:59.010 --> 33:00.692
- Yes.
- Really?

33:00.810 --> 33:02.581
You're gonna tell them
Lord Davenport

33:02.582 --> 33:05.255
sent his man to attack
your fiancée with acid?

33:05.256 --> 33:06.390
Yes.

33:06.391 --> 33:10.921
He is a well-respected man
of wealth and reputation.

33:11.084 --> 33:13.276
Police tend to treat men
like that lightly.

33:13.277 --> 33:15.677
- They must know the truth.
- The truth?

33:15.678 --> 33:19.679
It's your word, an ex-journalist,
against a peer of the realm.

33:19.885 --> 33:23.495
Come on. Who do you think
they're going to believe?

33:24.044 --> 33:28.681
Well, then I'll ask him myself.
Davenport won't lie to me.

33:28.819 --> 33:32.895
I don't care how much money
he has, I'll make him answer.

34:09.914 --> 34:14.484
- Ah, Mr. Harker.
- Tell me the truth.

34:14.588 --> 34:17.489
Sorry, I haven't an earthly idea
what you're talking about.

34:17.558 --> 34:19.940
Your man, Hackett.

34:20.795 --> 34:22.094
He attacked Mina.

34:22.317 --> 34:24.815
This was retaliation
for General Shaw.

34:24.817 --> 34:27.514
How dare you go after
an innocent woman?

34:27.568 --> 34:30.089
Listen, dear boy, I don't
know anything about this.

34:30.090 --> 34:32.072
Miss Murray,
is she all right?

34:33.039 --> 34:35.074
Who sent you here?

34:35.108 --> 34:36.775
No one.

34:36.809 --> 34:40.428
No.
It was Grayson, wasn't it?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.746
He put the ideas
into your head?

34:44.935 --> 34:47.435
Goaded you
into confronting me?

34:48.641 --> 34:50.789
You're pointing the gun
at the wrong man.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.135
Can't you see
what he's up to?

34:56.061 --> 34:59.587
Either way, he wins.
See?

35:00.064 --> 35:02.086
Whether you kill me
and go to jail,

35:02.087 --> 35:04.869
or I get a gun and kill you
as an intruder, he still wins.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.639
Wins what?
What are you talking about?

35:07.640 --> 35:11.276
Think! Who will be left behind
to look after Miss Murray?

35:11.277 --> 35:13.612
You see, deep down,
you know that's true.

35:13.968 --> 35:17.077
You've seen them together. You've seen
the way they look at one another.

35:17.078 --> 35:19.783
- He adores her. And she...
- That's a damn lie!

35:19.784 --> 35:21.760
I can prove it to you.

35:21.967 --> 35:25.537
Let me show you. Careful,
that revolver... it could go off.

35:25.538 --> 35:28.845
- Then tell me the truth.
- They've betrayed you.

35:30.171 --> 35:33.107
See, recently, I discovered
that Grayson has been searching

35:33.141 --> 35:35.112
for one particular painting.

35:35.276 --> 35:37.560
For 10 years,
he's been looking,

35:37.606 --> 35:39.924
in every auction
and every gallery across Europe.

35:39.925 --> 35:42.380
- Stop.
- And then he found it.

35:42.501 --> 35:45.057
I know this
because I stole it from him.

35:45.058 --> 35:47.856
- Don't move.
- You'll see for yourself.

35:47.909 --> 35:51.653
His obsession goes far beyond
mere paint and canvas.

35:52.180 --> 35:55.822
He hires you so that he
can get closer to her.

35:56.217 --> 35:59.253
He even hosts your engagement
party at his own home.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.455
- Shut up.
- Please, no... it's true. Listen.

36:02.490 --> 36:05.899
Let me show you,
and then you'll see.

36:06.188 --> 36:10.063
Then you'll understand
everything.

36:14.869 --> 36:17.046
Oh, God, no.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.901
Davenport,
Davenport...

36:55.646 --> 36:56.989
You there.

37:02.281 --> 37:03.984
You need help?

37:14.092 --> 37:16.142
Best be on your way now.

37:16.564 --> 37:19.996
Don't want a roller to find you
and take advantage.

37:28.105 --> 37:30.352
Cheerio, then.

37:54.598 --> 37:56.415
Jonathan.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.342
What in the world are you...?

38:30.949 --> 38:32.319
Hello.

38:51.259 --> 38:54.436
Darling,
you must be exhausted.

38:54.437 --> 38:57.406
I hope you haven't eaten.
The cook's kept dinner warm for you.

38:57.407 --> 38:59.159
Thank you, my dear.
How was your day?

38:59.160 --> 39:02.247
You won't believe it, but I have it
on good authority that Lady...

39:07.944 --> 39:11.853
- What in God's Name, Mrs. Gulliver?
- The children, the children...

39:11.878 --> 39:14.844
- They're gone, they're gone...
- Oh, my God...

39:17.484 --> 39:20.836
Sir, ma'am,
a man took them in.

39:22.564 --> 39:24.703
No!

40:04.873 --> 40:07.598
You asked me
to tell you the truth...

40:08.142 --> 40:10.290
Made me promise.

40:11.312 --> 40:13.641
I'll tell it to you now.

40:14.716 --> 40:17.732
Nothing has been the same
since first I saw you.

40:19.286 --> 40:22.481
You're a magic
beyond my understanding.

40:23.803 --> 40:25.723
I know it's impossible,

40:26.293 --> 40:30.285
but you are Ilona,
come back to me.

40:32.093 --> 40:33.989
But you're more than that.

40:35.473 --> 40:37.585
You are Mina too.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.307
Now, I've tried to keep
my feelings close...

40:43.877 --> 40:46.084
But I cannot.

40:47.747 --> 40:51.733
You make me want more
than I could possibly have.

40:54.554 --> 40:57.560
You make me want
to walk in the sun.

41:01.394 --> 41:03.691
I belong to you.

41:04.964 --> 41:07.548
And you belong to me.

41:41.273 --> 41:44.030
Lord Davenport is dead.

42:13.397 --> 42:17.262
Mr. Harker worked out
just as you planned.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.440
