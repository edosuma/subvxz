WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:02.870
We can finally get on with our lives.

00:04.470 --> 00:05.670
Who is she?

00:06.150 --> 00:08.870
She works for my lawyer, her name's Cass.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.510
She's nothing.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.550
I've got to know who did that to Meg.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.710
You can't do this by yourself.
You need to get some help.

00:15.870 --> 00:16.990
Give me another Scotch, please.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.830
- Oh, my God!
- Amy! Amy!

00:20.070 --> 00:22.030
- She's supposed to shit it out.
- Shit what out?

00:22.310 --> 00:24.070
- Heroin?
- Yes.

00:25.310 --> 00:27.790
Franky, I'd like you to speak
today at the Our Journey event.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.270
You haven't said the magic word.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.430
Then there's Miss Davidson.
She believed in me.

00:32.549 --> 00:34.990
She saw past the front, she saw who I was.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.070
It helped that she was hot.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.150
She's given me a hunger...

00:40.310 --> 00:41.950
... to be a better person.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.590
- You're up next, Liz.
- Liz!

00:47.870 --> 00:48.990
Our final speaker for today,

00:49.070 --> 00:51.270
this is our peer worker,
Elizabeth Birdsworth.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.950
- Who me?
- Is she pissed?

00:53.030 --> 00:54.310
She hasn't had booze in ages.

00:54.790 --> 00:58.830
Some of the women in here, they
stick drugs up their kids' bum.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.470
- Right, get her out.
- No, no, no!

01:00.830 --> 01:02.630
And the little kids, they OD, right?

01:03.350 --> 01:04.510
And she nearly died.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.990 --> 02:29.390
Tell me what you want me to do.

02:35.430 --> 02:36.470
Morning.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.830
I hope that dream was about me.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.830
Erica, hi.

03:04.270 --> 03:05.670
Not now, Hayley.

03:06.070 --> 03:07.150
I've got a lot to do.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.590
Just after a quick update on Meg
Jackson's murder investigation.

03:09.670 --> 03:11.590
You know to go through the proper channels.

03:11.670 --> 03:12.710
You can speak to our PR people,

03:12.790 --> 03:14.270
they're the ones issuing
statements right now.

03:14.710 --> 03:15.990
What about the Our Journey event?

03:16.350 --> 03:17.790
The incident with the prisoner.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.350
The little girl who OD'd
in the visitors' center.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.230
Any truth to the rumors the
department's losing faith in you?

03:24.310 --> 03:27.110
The promises you made on prison
reform, you haven't delivered on them.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.630
I'm sorry, don't you
have anything better to do

03:30.110 --> 03:32.750
than to stand around here and
look for someone to harass?

03:38.470 --> 03:39.550
Hold it.

03:40.110 --> 03:41.510
Perhaps we struck a nerve.

03:51.350 --> 03:52.430
Just stay calm.

03:52.510 --> 03:54.390
They want you to bite
back, it gives them a story.

03:54.470 --> 03:56.390
Well, they have a story, thanks to Liz.

03:58.390 --> 04:00.830
At least we got something
positive out of it.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.430
The department put this out.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.070
Took the curse off the
day for the Minister.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.270
Somewhat.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.310
Yeah, well, there's plenty
of women who are interested

04:10.390 --> 04:12.470
- in furthering their education.
- Are they articulate?

04:12.870 --> 04:14.270
Can they hold their own in a public forum?

04:14.350 --> 04:16.470
No, they would probably
cave under the pressure.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.829
Well, we can't afford to have a repeat

04:18.910 --> 04:20.390
of what happened to the peer worker.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.510
Morning, sir.

04:21.589 --> 04:23.630
She's not the peer worker anymore.

04:24.830 --> 04:28.310
We need someone who the public
can respond to in a positive way.

04:29.950 --> 04:32.390
- Someone with a profile.
- Franky.

04:32.590 --> 04:33.590
Franky.

04:34.470 --> 04:36.870
- When is she due for parole?
- Two years.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.230
That gives us time. All
right, get her in for a chat.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.830
Thought maybe you had a plan.

04:41.070 --> 04:42.430
Well, I'll just add it to the list.

04:42.590 --> 04:43.790
Move it to the top.

04:46.790 --> 04:48.470
Hey, watch out, boy.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.310
- Morning, Liz.
- Hi.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.830
It's not a very pleasant
way to start the day.

05:01.070 --> 05:03.390
Oh, it could have been
worse, it could have been poo.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.870
- No.
- That's true.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.830
- No way.
- Fucking run out.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.150
Poor thing.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.110
I feel sorry for her having to do that.

05:12.190 --> 05:13.270
Well, she asked for it.

05:13.790 --> 05:14.870
It's her job now.

05:28.350 --> 05:29.870
Hold up.

05:30.950 --> 05:31.990
Hey!

05:33.030 --> 05:34.830
I thought I'd get some feedback by now.

05:35.350 --> 05:36.350
It was tight, wasn't it?

05:37.790 --> 05:39.390
Everyone enjoyed your speech.

05:39.950 --> 05:42.510
- Were you satisfied?
- You impressed the hierarchy.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.630
In fact, they want you mentored.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.310
On, that sounds interesting.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.390
We can talk about it later.

05:49.270 --> 05:51.030
I'll get someone to
escort you to my office.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.550
Casual or formal?

05:55.710 --> 05:57.070
So I know what to wear.

06:00.670 --> 06:01.750
Hey, Dor!

06:03.230 --> 06:04.230
Dor!

06:04.790 --> 06:05.830
Ooh!

06:06.670 --> 06:09.390
Hey, when are you gonna
start talking to me?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.990
When you apologize for wrecking the event.

06:12.310 --> 06:13.790
I'm sorry.

06:14.550 --> 06:16.630
- No, you're not.
- Eh?

06:17.990 --> 06:20.390
It is kind of funny.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.070
- Doreen Anderson, Governor.
- Hi, Doreen.

07:03.710 --> 07:04.870
You're not in trouble, take a seat.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.030
So you did really well
at the Our Journey event,

07:13.110 --> 07:14.190
everyone was impressed.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.830
- Thanks.
- You were articulate, you were confident,

07:16.910 --> 07:18.750
you had the respect of the women.

07:19.150 --> 07:20.550
You've come a long way.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.110
I used to be scared about
getting up in front of people.

07:23.190 --> 07:26.190
I know. And now we need
more women like you.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.630
Women who want to better themselves.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.150
You've set a really good example.

07:31.310 --> 07:32.350
Ta.

07:32.430 --> 07:34.550
Which is why I want you
to be the new peer worker.

07:38.630 --> 07:39.710
But...

07:40.110 --> 07:41.230
But that's Liz's job.

07:43.150 --> 07:45.190
Well, Liz can't be trusted anymore.

07:45.470 --> 07:47.310
Oh, no, it's okay.

07:47.470 --> 07:49.230
I'd give you training, I
wouldn't just throw you in.

07:49.550 --> 07:52.350
There's plenty of other women
that'd be better, like... Brook.

07:52.510 --> 07:55.110
In H-3. She's smart. Or Justine.

07:55.230 --> 07:57.150
I... I mean, the women really like her.

07:57.390 --> 07:59.910
Well, I've considered others but I
think you're the woman for the job.

08:02.150 --> 08:04.710
So... So I'd just be doing it for
a little while till Liz got it back?

08:04.790 --> 08:08.230
No, if all goes well, this would be
a permanent thing until your release.

08:14.630 --> 08:15.790
I can't.

08:17.270 --> 08:19.230
I'd be stabbing Liz in the back.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.510
Well, Liz let you down, Doreen.

08:26.630 --> 08:29.070
I mean, Liz let everyone down.

08:30.350 --> 08:32.070
She doesn't deserve your loyalty.

08:33.350 --> 08:35.789
- She loves that job.
- And I understand.

08:37.590 --> 08:38.669
But I'm sorry,

08:39.710 --> 08:42.510
there's gonna be a new peer
worker whether it's you or not.

08:46.670 --> 08:47.750
Hey!

08:48.150 --> 08:49.310
What did she want?

08:49.390 --> 08:52.190
Uh, nothing, she just asked me
about the home brewing stuff.

08:54.070 --> 08:55.990
Oh, shit, am I in trouble?
I thought they found that.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.030
- Yeah, they did.
- So what did she want?

08:58.110 --> 08:59.270
Look, I just told you.

08:59.630 --> 09:01.710
I've had enough questions this morning.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.710
Oh, you've got the painters in, mate?

09:03.830 --> 09:05.990
Come on, get back to work. Oh, yeah.

09:06.190 --> 09:07.350
Higher, higher!

09:11.590 --> 09:12.670
Ooh!

09:13.630 --> 09:15.230
Hey, hey, hey!

09:15.310 --> 09:16.350
Get out of it!

09:19.270 --> 09:20.590
Want me to do something?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.310
No, it's fine.

09:24.590 --> 09:26.070
Get out of it.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.470
Get back to work.

09:34.430 --> 09:35.470
Ooh!

09:35.750 --> 09:37.710
If that's the best you
can do, I'm disappointed.

09:38.630 --> 09:39.950
You're losing it, Francesca.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.550
Too busy sucking up to the Governor.

09:42.150 --> 09:43.910
Hey, uh, could you get
Cass to give me a call?

09:43.990 --> 09:45.550
I could do with a blonde.

09:45.630 --> 09:46.990
Hey, what's wrong with brunettes?

09:47.510 --> 09:49.790
Keep your disgusting sex life to yourself.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.870
Hey, do you think Cass' hair
is really blonde, though?

09:53.470 --> 09:54.550
Yeah, it looks real.

09:54.630 --> 09:56.070
It doesn't have that
black thing down the middle

09:56.150 --> 09:57.750
when the re-growth starts.

09:57.830 --> 09:58.830
Hello.

09:58.990 --> 10:02.030
- Just shut up, Liz!
- Oh, yes, she talks. Doreen!

10:02.350 --> 10:03.750
Come back, talk to me!

10:03.910 --> 10:06.750
Doreen! Doreen! Doreen!

10:12.150 --> 10:13.790
That was a piss-poor effort.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.870
You are obviously writing
yourself off again.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.110
You have no bloody idea, Fletch.

10:18.190 --> 10:20.750
I know it's not getting you any closer
to finding out who killed your wife.

10:21.910 --> 10:23.790
What do you reckon Meg'd
say if she saw you like this?

10:24.550 --> 10:26.070
You need to get your head straight, Will.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.430
Get your shit sorted and
think about what you're doing.

10:29.910 --> 10:30.990
You're a joke.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.030
Argh.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.990
So the, uh, the department
think you have real potential

10:52.070 --> 10:53.910
and want to help you make the most of it.

10:55.550 --> 10:58.150
So you need to decide
on some career options.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.310
Focus your study accordingly.

11:04.110 --> 11:05.430
Accordingly.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.990
- What?
- Oh, you went formal.

11:08.670 --> 11:09.990
It's disappointing.

11:10.510 --> 11:12.230
I thought our relationship
had moved past that.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.870
I think you should take this seriously.

11:14.710 --> 11:17.270
- I think it's a good offer.
- Yeah, I know.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.550
- I'll do it.
- Great.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.030
As long as you're my tutor.

11:27.630 --> 11:29.150
No, that's not possible.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.630
- You helped me get my HSC.
- No, I didn't.

11:32.830 --> 11:35.030
I didn't sit the exams for you, Franky.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.590
Yeah, but you know how to motivate me.

11:36.990 --> 11:39.270
- I don't force you to better yourself.
- We work well together.

11:40.590 --> 11:42.910
I just don't have time
to tutor you anymore.

11:43.150 --> 11:44.630
I'll work hard, I'll make you look good.

11:44.990 --> 11:46.030
No, I can't.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.230
Yeah, you can.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.270
Medical's running a bit behind today.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.750
You know I had a urine test two days ago.

12:08.990 --> 12:12.110
It's just random. It's nothing to
worry about if you're not using.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.470
You know, I saw Liz earlier.
She's looking a bit of a mess.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.710
- Yeah, well, she lost parole.
- Hmm.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.350
G-O-1 calling C-O-3,

12:21.470 --> 12:22.790
new arrivals in 20.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.630
Yeah, C-O-3, copy that.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.630
I'll go get the nurse.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.830
Stop picking your nose, it's gross.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.110
Hey!

12:40.790 --> 12:42.390
You look like you've been
caught with your pants down.

12:43.590 --> 12:44.630
What have you done?

12:44.750 --> 12:46.910
I just saw Mr. Jackson without his top on.

12:47.430 --> 12:50.950
- Bloody hell, wish I'd been there.
- Ah, he caught me staring at him.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.150
At least it'll give you something
to think about late at night,

12:53.350 --> 12:54.670
under the covers.

12:54.750 --> 12:58.030
- Oh, we all know what gets you off, Liz.
- Oh, do you, Doreen?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.870
Yeah. Got to do a bit of self-service.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.510
And if you're wondering what
the moaning is some mornings,

13:02.830 --> 13:04.350
that's Boomer and her Fevola poster.

13:07.390 --> 13:08.510
Makes me come like a werewolf.

13:08.590 --> 13:10.670
Oh! Too much information.

13:10.870 --> 13:13.030
- Oi, Franks!
- What?

13:13.630 --> 13:15.070
We know what gets you off.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.190
A girl's got to have her secrets, mate.

13:18.630 --> 13:21.870
Hey, Bea, don't you
pretend you don't do it.

13:21.950 --> 13:23.350
Yeah, come on, you must
have flicked yourself off.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.830
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, guys, leave her alone.

13:25.910 --> 13:28.470
- Have you? Have you?
- My sex life is none of your business.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.430
- Oh, my God, she hasn't.
- What, never?

13:31.550 --> 13:33.030
Bloody hell.

13:33.150 --> 13:35.190
Are you serious? Eh?

13:35.790 --> 13:38.550
That's why you're so uptight
all the frigging time, Bea.

13:38.630 --> 13:39.750
Fuck you, Liz.

13:39.830 --> 13:42.670
Ooh, hey, she's never
said fuck before, to me.

13:43.070 --> 13:46.230
Hey, why don't you have a
bit of a go, darling? Go on.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.230
It'll make you feel nice and relaxed.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.670
Liz...

13:49.750 --> 13:52.830
Oh, what, Doreen, I am having fun.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.030
It's not funny, it's just mean.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.750
It's just the piss talking.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.710
Well, I fucking like the booze talking.

14:01.110 --> 14:03.550
Shut up.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.830
- Hey, what happened to your shoulder?
- Strained rotator cuff.

14:08.990 --> 14:10.710
Ugh! That sounds painful.

14:10.990 --> 14:12.350
It's fine.

14:15.950 --> 14:18.190
Where's he gonna eat that, the car park?

14:19.830 --> 14:21.710
Hey, what's going on between you two?

14:23.790 --> 14:25.790
Okay, fine, happy to stay out of it.

14:28.590 --> 14:29.990
Coming out tonight?

14:31.110 --> 14:32.190
Trivia at the local.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.190
- Didn't Chris tell you?
- No.

14:35.950 --> 14:38.070
- Are you going, Vera?
- No.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.790
Adam's taking me out, so...

14:39.990 --> 14:42.110
It's a show, I think, in the city.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.190
He wanted to surprise me.

14:44.270 --> 14:46.070
I think I'll give it a miss,
too. I'm not in the mood.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.550
You get in the mood once you're
out. That's the whole point.

14:49.510 --> 14:51.070
Come on, Fletch, you know you want to.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.430
You're scared I'll beat you at Trivia.

14:53.510 --> 14:56.230
- Hasn't happened so far.
- Hah! Sounds like a challenge.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.710
Why is Franky refusing?

14:59.990 --> 15:02.950
- She's trying to set conditions.
- Well, what does she want?

15:05.510 --> 15:08.350
I mean, her demands are ridiculous.

15:08.470 --> 15:09.670
Well, what did she ask for?

15:09.750 --> 15:11.070
Early release? Special favors? What?

15:11.150 --> 15:13.390
Look, she's playing games, Derek. I mean...

15:13.470 --> 15:16.310
We give her this sort of power,
God knows what she'll ask for next.

15:18.310 --> 15:21.870
You do whatever you have
to to keep her in line.

15:28.830 --> 15:29.950
Hey.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.590
What are you doing, Liz?

15:38.790 --> 15:39.990
Nothing.

15:42.510 --> 15:44.550
You know you need to get
your shit together, right?

15:45.870 --> 15:47.750
Yeah. Yeah.

15:50.590 --> 15:52.830
Franky, you're needed in Education.

15:53.190 --> 15:54.310
Ooh, hot stuff.

16:08.470 --> 16:09.590
Doreen?

16:10.950 --> 16:12.950
I know that day was important to you

16:13.430 --> 16:14.830
and I am really sorry.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.790
It really meant something
and you turned it into a joke.

16:21.550 --> 16:24.350
- Well, I said I'm sorry...
- And it's stuffed up your parole.

16:25.070 --> 16:27.590
- Didn't you even care what would happen?
- Now, you give it a rest.

16:27.950 --> 16:29.070
And you being pissed all day...

16:29.150 --> 16:32.190
Oh, yeah, yeah, here
we go, blah, blah, blah!

16:32.270 --> 16:33.990
- I hate it when you're like this!
- Like what?

16:34.270 --> 16:37.870
Miss Davidson was right,
you don't deserve that job.

16:37.950 --> 16:40.030
- What?
- Yes, she offered me peer worker

16:40.430 --> 16:42.710
and I said no because I
didn't want you to be upset.

16:43.990 --> 16:45.750
She offered you peer worker?

16:45.910 --> 16:47.510
Yeah, and I turned it down, Liz.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.710
Oh, why don't you take it? I don't care!

16:49.790 --> 16:52.230
- Maybe I will!
- Oh, fuck, you'll last five minutes.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.430
- What?
- I said you won't last five minutes.

16:56.030 --> 16:58.150
- Why is that, Liz? Yeah.
- Why?

16:58.230 --> 17:00.190
'Cause you're dumb and
you're black, Doreen,

17:00.270 --> 17:02.150
and the women are never gonna
come to you and talk to you

17:02.230 --> 17:05.790
in the same way that they
talk to me! That's why!

17:10.190 --> 17:11.510
That's why.

17:28.069 --> 17:30.030
I can't believe you said that.

17:35.030 --> 17:37.270
You're supposed to be my friend, Liz.

17:48.990 --> 17:50.830
Ah, Miss Davidson.

17:51.590 --> 17:52.590
Hi.

17:54.590 --> 17:55.710
Uh...

17:56.390 --> 17:57.470
I want to do it.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.350
I want to be peer worker.

17:59.550 --> 18:00.630
You've changed your mind.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.070
Yeah. I thought a lot about
what you said and you're right.

18:03.470 --> 18:05.110
I want to help the women in here.

18:05.230 --> 18:06.710
I'm really pleased to hear that.

18:07.990 --> 18:09.630
Don't worry, you're gonna be great.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.670
I knew you wouldn't be able to resist.

18:26.110 --> 18:28.030
So I, uh, brought some brochures

18:28.110 --> 18:30.230
for us to talk through,
see if anything appeals.

18:30.630 --> 18:32.030
What appeals to you?

18:32.710 --> 18:33.950
Apart from me.

18:35.230 --> 18:36.950
Brochures, Franky.

18:38.590 --> 18:40.790
It's a big decision.

18:41.630 --> 18:42.670
Why did you choose law?

18:45.190 --> 18:47.350
I mean, there's various
career opportunities.

18:47.430 --> 18:51.470
There's plenty of university courses
by correspondence we can look at.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.790
Come on, Franky, we've got an hour a week,

18:53.870 --> 18:54.990
I want to make the most of it.

18:55.070 --> 18:56.750
- You didn't answer the question.
- I don't intend to.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.510
Did you not understand the question?

18:58.590 --> 19:01.150
Oh, my God, you sound like
a lawyer. What about law?

19:03.710 --> 19:04.990
I've missed this.

19:06.790 --> 19:08.710
Attention, compound, attention, compound.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.670
Count will commence in 10 minutes.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.990
What's the view like from down there?

19:18.910 --> 19:20.630
Long way from being peer worker.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.270
You know, I can understand
the fresher girls

19:23.350 --> 19:25.430
stepping out of line, not
knowing how things work,

19:25.790 --> 19:28.230
but someone who's been around
as long as you and I have,

19:28.790 --> 19:30.350
you disappoint me, Liz.

19:31.710 --> 19:34.390
You don't have the privileges
of a peer worker anymore.

19:34.870 --> 19:36.190
No fence to sit on.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.310
You want to make sure you
come down on the right side.

19:51.510 --> 19:52.550
It's a lot to think about.

19:54.270 --> 19:55.550
We need more time.

19:55.670 --> 19:58.110
No, I don't expect you to
make your decision today

19:58.190 --> 20:00.350
but you have to keep in mind the
closing dates for applications.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.790
So you don't have much time.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.830
I mean, is there anything
here that even interests you?

20:08.550 --> 20:10.190
Yeah.

20:10.790 --> 20:13.630
- Franky...
- But I don't know if I can say.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.630
I mean, once it's out
there, it's out there.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.750
I don't want to limit myself.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.230
- Well, I just want...
- It's like sex, you know.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.910
... to maximize our time together.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.430
When you first start fucking
it's scary and exciting,

20:26.830 --> 20:29.190
'cause there's this whole
world you know nothing about.

20:29.470 --> 20:30.510
But you don't want to look like an idiot.

20:31.710 --> 20:35.390
So you skip the exploration and
you do what you think's expected.

20:36.270 --> 20:37.910
Really, isn't that the best bit?

20:39.390 --> 20:43.430
When it's new, scary,
a little bit dangerous.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.670
We're here to talk
about your future career.

20:46.950 --> 20:49.710
Well, how can you help me choose
a career if you don't get me?

20:52.230 --> 20:53.710
I had sex with guys for ages

20:53.790 --> 20:55.590
'cause I thought that was what I had to do.

20:56.470 --> 20:59.590
It was okay, but something was missing.

21:00.430 --> 21:01.910
Then I fucked a woman.

21:03.230 --> 21:05.070
I'd been getting it wrong for years.

21:08.670 --> 21:09.950
So now,

21:10.590 --> 21:13.830
I never could admit to anything
without exploring every possibility.

21:19.990 --> 21:21.110
You enjoyed that.

21:23.190 --> 21:24.270
What?

21:25.390 --> 21:27.550
You were being deliberately provocative.

21:29.630 --> 21:30.910
No, I wasn't.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.550
It did nothing for me.

21:44.630 --> 21:45.630
Hello.

21:50.430 --> 21:51.510
Hello!

22:12.990 --> 22:14.630
Another lawyer to follow in the fine

22:14.710 --> 22:16.430
footsteps of the Davidson family.

22:16.910 --> 22:19.470
- If only he knew...
- What a dirty girl I am.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.870
- We gotta close the blinds.
- Why?

22:21.950 --> 22:23.230
No, don't, don't. Come here.

22:23.310 --> 22:24.510
So people can't see in.

22:25.030 --> 22:26.190
So?

22:26.950 --> 22:29.190
I wanna give them something to talk about.

22:30.710 --> 22:31.910
Just wait!

22:32.710 --> 22:34.950
- They're shut now. Come here. Shh!
- Don't be such a spoilsport!

22:39.630 --> 22:41.790
What do you want to do to me?

22:42.830 --> 22:44.550
- I just want you.
- Come on, say it.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.750
- I love you.
- No, that's not what I want to hear.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.630
Oh, what are you doing?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.030
Erica...

22:53.230 --> 22:54.870
- Pull my fucking hair!
- Hey?

22:55.590 --> 22:58.270
Pull my fucking hair. I don't
want to fuck like a married couple.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.150
What?

23:01.750 --> 23:02.790
What?

23:09.070 --> 23:11.950
- Erica, what...
- Forget it. It doesn't matter.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.710
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

23:15.550 --> 23:16.710
What... What was that?

23:33.270 --> 23:34.470
So what was that all about?

23:36.030 --> 23:38.470
Um... Nothing.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.270
I just wanted to try something
different, that's all.

23:47.750 --> 23:49.910
- So we've got a problem.
- No.

23:50.910 --> 23:54.270
Of course not, I'm sorry.
Seriously, let's just forget it.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.390
- Are you bored with me or something?
- No!

24:00.350 --> 24:02.190
You know, we can try whatever you want.

24:02.630 --> 24:05.310
Just tell me what you want
me to do. What would you like.

24:07.510 --> 24:09.590
Yeah, you've kind of killed the mood now.

24:12.230 --> 24:15.190
It's sex, Mark, it's supposed
to be dirty sometimes.

24:15.270 --> 24:16.710
It doesn't have to be so...

24:17.550 --> 24:18.550
So what, Erica?

24:18.630 --> 24:21.830
Nice! It doesn't have to
be so nice all the time!

24:26.030 --> 24:27.510
- Mark...
- Fuck off!

24:27.710 --> 24:29.790
- No! Don't strike me.
- Get the fuck away from me!

24:37.550 --> 24:39.070
Fuck, do you want to get married...

24:39.790 --> 24:40.870
Now?

24:42.470 --> 24:44.110
Well, not exactly this second.

24:44.630 --> 24:46.270
Yeah, but you've always said no.

24:46.990 --> 24:48.630
What, you don't want to marry me now?

24:50.190 --> 24:52.350
Whoo-hoo!

24:52.630 --> 24:54.790
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!

24:54.910 --> 24:56.110
I love you!

25:15.750 --> 25:16.790
Wish we could help her.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.270
Why? She's a nasty drunk.

25:19.790 --> 25:22.350
She was like that the last
time she got on the booze.

25:22.950 --> 25:24.990
Doreen, Governor wants to see you.

25:30.830 --> 25:31.870
Bea.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.870
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

25:50.350 --> 25:51.350
Liz?

25:53.590 --> 25:54.590
Liz?

25:55.390 --> 25:57.310
- Hey, Liz!
- What happened?

25:57.710 --> 25:59.870
- Lizzie?
- Hey, Mr. Jackson!

26:00.430 --> 26:01.670
Hey!

26:02.230 --> 26:03.510
She just passed out.

26:04.470 --> 26:05.630
Move, move away from her.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.270
Liz?

26:07.870 --> 26:09.070
Liz, can you hear me?

26:11.870 --> 26:13.590
Uh, 04 to 01.

26:13.830 --> 26:16.110
Medical assistance in exercise yard, over!

26:17.350 --> 26:19.190
- What'd she take?
- I don't know.

26:20.190 --> 26:22.870
- You need to tell me.
- I don't know. She just fell over.

26:39.270 --> 26:41.150
I don't know, she just hit the deck.

26:41.590 --> 26:44.070
All right, back to your
units. Spot check, ladies!

26:44.430 --> 26:45.470
Spot check!

26:48.830 --> 26:51.150
Hey, is Liz okay? Can, can we see her?

26:51.470 --> 26:52.830
Well, your peer worker can.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.190
- Yeah, we don't have one.
- Yeah.

26:54.590 --> 26:56.670
Doreen! Haven't you told them yet?

26:57.630 --> 26:58.710
Nah.

27:05.470 --> 27:07.710
What's the matter, Francesca? One down.

27:07.950 --> 27:09.230
What do you know about it, Jacqueline?

27:10.310 --> 27:11.510
Nothing I can recall.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.270
Well, you know better than
to fuck with my family.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.350
Hey, how come you didn't tell us?

27:24.430 --> 27:25.710
Yeah, does Liz know?

27:26.070 --> 27:27.630
Look, it only just happened.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.150
I wanted to say something
but then Liz collapsed.

27:30.870 --> 27:32.070
It's good you're doing it.

27:32.550 --> 27:33.590
You'd look after Liz.

27:33.990 --> 27:35.350
Yeah, she needs it.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.430
She's been going off the rails.

27:38.030 --> 27:39.910
Hey, how long are we gonna
be locked in here for?

27:40.230 --> 27:41.430
Could be a while.

27:43.190 --> 27:44.510
Well, I'm going to bed, then.

27:44.990 --> 27:46.070
What, now?

27:46.310 --> 27:48.910
- It's only 4:00.
- Yeah, I didn't say I was sleeping.

27:50.070 --> 27:51.390
Hey, uh, tell us about
Mr. Jackson's body again.

27:51.710 --> 27:52.910
No! No, no!

27:53.030 --> 27:54.510
Hey!

27:55.270 --> 27:56.630
I was just asking.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.430
Selfish!

28:07.950 --> 28:09.550
Jacs is getting desperate.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.950
I want you to look out for yourself.

28:17.150 --> 28:18.550
It wasn't Jacs.

28:21.430 --> 28:22.790
You're fucking kidding me!

28:23.070 --> 28:25.310
I didn't mean to hurt her, Franky.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.070
I wanted to teach her a lesson,

28:27.150 --> 28:29.270
you know, make her a bit sick
and get her off the booze.

28:29.550 --> 28:31.790
- I didn't know she'd pass out.
- What did you do?

28:35.190 --> 28:36.550
I put bleach in it.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.110
- Bleach?
- Yes, I...

28:40.190 --> 28:42.510
- You're really lucky she's not dead.
- I know.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.870
I want to tell her I'm sorry.

28:46.670 --> 28:48.630
You don't say a word of this to anyone.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.470
If we start turning on each
other we've got nothing,

28:52.830 --> 28:55.630
and if Jacs finds out,
this comes back on me.

28:57.510 --> 28:58.910
Now, you don't do another fucking thing

28:58.990 --> 29:00.430
without my say so.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.430
You keep your mouth shut.

29:03.510 --> 29:04.550
Get to your room.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.870
Go!

29:07.350 --> 29:08.830
Fucking three-year-old!

29:09.710 --> 29:11.110
Fuck!

29:16.270 --> 29:17.350
Oh, come on!

29:17.430 --> 29:19.310
Hey, you've called Mark,
please leave a message.

29:21.030 --> 29:23.790
Come on, Mark, I've been trying to
call you all morning. You couldn't...

29:25.710 --> 29:28.950
At least send me a text. Or something.

30:38.510 --> 30:41.390
- Erica, welcome.
- Hi, Tom.

30:42.070 --> 30:43.510
I hope you don't mind meeting here.

30:43.830 --> 30:44.830
No.

30:46.590 --> 30:47.790
Come through.

31:27.750 --> 31:28.790
Champagne.

31:30.270 --> 31:31.430
I insist.

31:34.310 --> 31:37.710
I'm quite surprised your father
agreed to take on this case.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.190
It's not something his firm
would normally consider.

31:40.270 --> 31:41.350
Yeah, well, my father

31:41.590 --> 31:42.950
isn't the one who's here.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.030
Hmm.

31:44.790 --> 31:46.190
So I see.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.670
Everyone deserves the
right to representation.

31:49.430 --> 31:51.670
Even those that work in this industry?

31:51.830 --> 31:53.110
A job's a job.

31:53.590 --> 31:55.190
And some are more alternative than others.

32:00.310 --> 32:01.590
I'm impressed.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.710
Five minutes and you
haven't batted an eyelid,

32:05.670 --> 32:09.150
and there was I thinking all you
lawyers were a bunch of clenched...

32:09.910 --> 32:11.070
Assholes.

32:12.630 --> 32:15.590
You hired me to do a job, Tom.
I don't care where we meet.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.510
See anything you like?

32:17.590 --> 32:19.630
I'm gonna need a couple of signatures.

32:20.390 --> 32:21.670
I could show you around.

32:22.390 --> 32:23.550
No, thanks.

32:26.630 --> 32:27.870
I like you, Erica.

32:29.190 --> 32:32.470
It'll be fascinating to see
where your career takes you.

33:02.950 --> 33:04.990
- We're all done.
- Great.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.590
I will need to see you again
when the matter is resolved.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.150
Whenever you like.

33:11.390 --> 33:12.430
Thank you, Tom.

33:49.430 --> 33:50.550
Ahhh!

34:32.989 --> 34:34.630
The department want to meet about Franky.

34:35.190 --> 34:36.710
They want to put out a press release.

34:37.630 --> 34:38.710
Is now a good time?

34:39.590 --> 34:41.070
Yeah.

34:49.590 --> 34:51.590
Do you reckon I'm a nice person, Bea?

34:51.710 --> 34:54.310
Yeah, of course I do. Why?

34:55.750 --> 34:56.949
Doesn't matter.

34:57.550 --> 34:58.630
Everything all right?

35:00.910 --> 35:02.510
Yeah, just watching some telly.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.350
The women trust the peer worker, right?

35:11.830 --> 35:13.630
Well, they all trusted Liz.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.830
And the peer worker's meant to
look out for the women, isn't she?

35:16.910 --> 35:18.310
Well, she's meant to.

35:22.830 --> 35:23.950
Hey.

35:24.750 --> 35:25.830
You'll be fine.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.390
It just takes time, that's all.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.470
- I'm home. Hey!

35:32.910 --> 35:34.110
God, you gave us such a big fright.

35:35.710 --> 35:38.670
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah. My guts are sore.

35:39.910 --> 35:41.750
Can I get you something?
Do you want water, tea...

35:42.150 --> 35:43.990
- Oh, water would be good. Thanks.
- Right.

35:46.630 --> 35:48.830
You're looking a lot better
than the last time I saw you.

35:48.990 --> 35:50.110
Hmm. Hope so.

35:50.390 --> 35:51.790
- Here you are, love.
- Thanks.

35:53.910 --> 35:55.030
Mmm.

35:58.510 --> 35:59.910
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:00.350 --> 36:02.870
- Hey, I'll talk to you later.
- See you.

36:07.190 --> 36:08.350
What, what are we watching?

36:15.270 --> 36:16.550
I'm so sorry, Dor.

36:17.710 --> 36:20.230
I never thought you'd say
something like that, Liz.

36:20.630 --> 36:21.790
Neither did I.

36:22.870 --> 36:24.630
It's the booze, you know, I...

36:24.790 --> 36:26.150
I drink and then I say stuff...

36:26.230 --> 36:27.750
That's a crap excuse, Liz.

36:29.070 --> 36:30.550
Yeah, you're right, it is.

36:33.910 --> 36:36.590
You don't ever, ever

36:36.950 --> 36:38.750
play the black card with me, Liz.

36:40.670 --> 36:41.750
Sorry.

36:52.470 --> 36:54.470
- Doreen is so upset.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:55.510 --> 36:57.110
Yeah, it's gonna take her a while.

36:57.190 --> 36:59.790
No. I did say some pretty shocking things.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.190
I heard.

37:01.710 --> 37:03.470
You said some pretty
rude things to me, too.

37:03.830 --> 37:07.150
Oh, mate, I am so sorry
if I embarrassed you

37:07.230 --> 37:09.110
with all that masturbation stuff.

37:09.750 --> 37:10.870
Sorry.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.190
You know, um...

37:12.590 --> 37:15.110
- I was 18 when I married Harry.
- Oh.

37:15.310 --> 37:16.710
- Pregnant.
- Hmm.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.710
- Sick through most of it.
- Yeah.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.670
Sex was the last thing I felt like.

37:22.790 --> 37:24.030
Hmm. Fair enough.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.110
Made him pretty angry.

37:29.150 --> 37:30.910
Is that when he started hitting you?

37:37.870 --> 37:39.070
I'm so sorry, Bea.

37:40.790 --> 37:43.230
Just sex, you know, it's...

37:43.830 --> 37:45.670
For me, it's always been...

37:46.630 --> 37:48.670
- Uh...
- Not... Not crash hot?

37:48.750 --> 37:50.030
Not crash hot.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.510
Nah, I'm not a prude.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.630
But you're right, I have never...

37:58.430 --> 37:59.430
Done that.

37:59.590 --> 38:03.310
Well, my friend, now is your time.

38:04.230 --> 38:05.990
Give it a go, eh?

38:06.430 --> 38:10.430
There is nothing wrong in
making yourself feel good, Bea.

38:11.070 --> 38:12.190
Nothing.

38:12.710 --> 38:13.710
Thanks.

38:18.870 --> 38:19.910
Mark.

38:21.110 --> 38:23.190
Baby, I've been trying to call you all day.

38:28.030 --> 38:30.030
When have I ever mistreated you, Erica?

38:31.310 --> 38:32.310
You haven't.

38:32.910 --> 38:33.910
Right.

38:34.550 --> 38:35.590
Never.

38:36.190 --> 38:37.470
I treat you with respect.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.150
Yes.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.430
Now, if you don't want that,

38:41.190 --> 38:43.350
then I think maybe
you're with the wrong guy.

38:46.550 --> 38:47.630
No, I'm not.

38:48.230 --> 38:49.910
Okay, so what was last night all about?

38:52.070 --> 38:54.270
Come on, I'm tough, I
can handle it, tell me.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.310
- Erica...
- I don't want to fight about this.

38:58.390 --> 38:59.990
Well, answer the question, then.

39:02.030 --> 39:03.910
You know, I've had a
really hard time at work.

39:05.350 --> 39:07.550
Well, I wanted to try
something different, that's all.

39:07.750 --> 39:08.910
- Because you're bored?
- No.

39:09.030 --> 39:10.870
Because it was a
spur-of-the-moment thing.

39:10.950 --> 39:12.190
It was just a thing.

39:13.590 --> 39:14.790
I thought we had a good sex life.

39:14.910 --> 39:16.630
Yeah, we do.

39:21.430 --> 39:23.350
We've been engaged for five years.

39:24.950 --> 39:27.510
And we keep pushing it
back and back and back,

39:27.590 --> 39:29.110
and now we don't even talk about it.

39:32.190 --> 39:33.630
Maybe it's never gonna happen.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.310
You know what it's been like
trying to get out of Dad's firm.

39:40.470 --> 39:41.510
Mmm-hmm.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.910
You know what it's like and
then I get into Wentworth,

39:43.990 --> 39:46.430
and then I get a promotion.
You know I'm stressed out.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.590
I'm stressed out and
I'm taking it out on you

39:49.670 --> 39:51.030
and I know that's not fair.

39:51.710 --> 39:53.390
I'm not gonna change, Erica.

39:55.230 --> 39:56.390
This is it.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.910
If you are not happy with that,

40:02.030 --> 40:03.350
then you need to tell me

40:04.070 --> 40:05.270
and walk away.

40:13.950 --> 40:15.430
No, that's not what I...

40:17.190 --> 40:18.870
No, that's not what I want.

40:26.470 --> 40:27.670
I love you.

40:30.030 --> 40:31.430
I want to be your wife.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.790
- Anderson.
- Here.

40:44.470 --> 40:45.670
- Birdsworth.
- Here.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.470
- And Smith.
- Here.

40:49.550 --> 40:51.110
All right. Good night, ladies.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.670
Good night, Mr. Jackson.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.790
Hey, Mr. Jackson.

40:55.110 --> 40:56.230
Sweet dreams.

40:58.030 --> 40:59.310
Good night, Boomer.

41:03.470 --> 41:04.630
Good night, Mr. Jackson.

41:05.670 --> 41:06.670
Good night, ladies.

41:06.830 --> 41:07.830
Woo!

41:47.430 --> 41:48.430
Look.

43:06.950 --> 43:08.550
Tell me what you want me to do.

43:11.590 --> 43:12.950
Just love me.
