01:05.700 --> 01:07.240
- Long ago the ancient Greeks

01:07.240 --> 01:09.780
told the tale of Lycian and of Arcadia,

01:09.780 --> 01:12.850
a cruel King and father of many children.

01:12.850 --> 01:15.740
A man with no time for authority figures

01:15.740 --> 01:18.210
and contempt for the Gods.

01:18.210 --> 01:21.030
So it was that one night, in order to test

01:21.030 --> 01:23.250
the omnipotence of the great Zeus

01:23.250 --> 01:26.180
he invited him to dinner
and served him a meal

01:26.180 --> 01:29.330
he would never forget, the boiled flesh

01:29.330 --> 01:31.703
of his youngest son, Niktamus.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.690
But Zeus of course was all knowing,

01:35.690 --> 01:38.263
and straight away restored
the dead child's life,

01:41.510 --> 01:44.591
and in his rage Zeus
cursed Lycian, damning him

01:44.591 --> 01:48.520
to wander the Earth as a savage beast,

01:48.520 --> 01:50.040
the Lycan, a wolf.

03:52.620 --> 03:54.950
- The Beast of Bray Road
was not even my first book.

03:54.950 --> 03:57.870
I had one that I'd been
researching for six years

03:57.870 --> 04:02.870
about a true crime poison
murder in Walworth county

04:03.190 --> 04:06.400
that happened in the
1920's and I really wanted

04:06.400 --> 04:09.270
to get that story out too,
so I wrote that one first,

04:09.270 --> 04:11.450
that was my second book,
the Beast of Bray Road,

04:11.450 --> 04:14.700
tailing Wisconsin's
werewolf, and that really,

04:14.700 --> 04:16.910
again I thought it would settle things

04:16.910 --> 04:18.620
kind of once and for all and it just

04:18.620 --> 04:20.697
brought the whole thing to life again.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.690
Elkhorn is a very pretty nice, little town

04:27.690 --> 04:29.460
right in the center of Walworth county,

04:29.460 --> 04:32.330
it's where the court
house and everything is,

04:32.330 --> 04:34.170
it has a beautiful town square

04:34.170 --> 04:35.790
that was the subject of some famous

04:35.790 --> 04:38.760
Christmas cards years ago.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.989
It's just a very nice
conservative little town,

04:41.989 --> 04:44.070
it's just a great place
to raise my family,

04:44.070 --> 04:46.700
and it doesn't look
like a place that would

04:46.700 --> 04:48.023
harbor a werewolf.

04:49.630 --> 04:51.680
- Situated in Walworth County,

04:51.680 --> 04:53.850
the city of Elkhorn is comprised of nearly

04:53.850 --> 04:56.860
eight square miles of
land and has a population

04:56.860 --> 04:58.603
of just over 10,000 people.

04:59.554 --> 05:01.760
It was founded in the early 1800's

05:01.760 --> 05:04.080
and acts as the county seat, due in part

05:04.080 --> 05:07.830
to it's location at the
geographic center of the county.

05:07.830 --> 05:10.450
Elkhorn has become a thriving little town

05:10.450 --> 05:13.690
thanks to its proximity to the
nearby tourist destinations

05:13.690 --> 05:17.950
of Lake Geneva and Delavan
Lake, both home to resorts

05:17.950 --> 05:20.680
and considered popular vacation get aways.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.640
Nevertheless the area also has its share

05:23.640 --> 05:26.330
of local legends and lore.

05:26.330 --> 05:29.750
- I'd never considered that
it was particularly weird

05:29.750 --> 05:33.490
but when you start looking at
all the variety of terrain,

05:33.490 --> 05:35.990
we have hauntings everywhere,

05:35.990 --> 05:40.540
everything about the state
is what you don't picture

05:40.540 --> 05:43.397
when you initially here
the term Wisconsin.

05:43.397 --> 05:48.397
Also, a very long time and
special Native American presence

05:48.970 --> 05:51.300
that isn't necessarily just weird,

05:51.300 --> 05:54.080
you know it just makes
Wisconsin a very different

05:54.080 --> 05:56.320
sort of place and maybe sets the stage

05:56.320 --> 05:59.320
for some of the other things
that come later that are weird.

06:00.332 --> 06:02.670
- The state is actually
one of the hottest states

06:02.670 --> 06:06.010
of paranormal activity, number one.

06:06.010 --> 06:09.570
I don't know if it's
the Native American's,

06:09.570 --> 06:14.450
the history there, but there's
also a lot of UFO sightings,

06:14.450 --> 06:17.060
just in our state that I've
even seen just down here

06:17.060 --> 06:20.460
in South East Wisconsin,
as well as a lot of other

06:20.460 --> 06:25.460
crazy things, so I definitely
think it is something special.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.190
Wisconsin welcomes you.

06:27.190 --> 06:30.950
- Elkhorn got it's name
because someone saw an elk horn

06:30.950 --> 06:33.490
hanging in a tree, but it
wasn't from around here,

06:33.490 --> 06:35.360
there weren't elk in this area.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.803
So the theory is that someone coming back

06:37.803 --> 06:41.280
from the west had an elk horn
and threw it up in the tree.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.273
I guess that's the
rumor I've heard anyway.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.130
- In her books Linda Godfrey

06:48.130 --> 06:50.780
has detailed a number of
Wisconsin's more infamous

06:50.780 --> 06:53.440
tall tales, from hair covered forest elves

06:53.440 --> 06:55.300
that roam the northern regions,

06:55.300 --> 06:58.170
to mysterious aberrations
that haunt it's numerous

06:58.170 --> 06:59.920
abandoned buildings.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.410
An aquatic monster is
said to lurk in the depths

07:02.410 --> 07:05.650
of Lake Winnebago, while
hitch hiking phantoms

07:05.650 --> 07:08.410
have been seen by a number
of unsuspecting motorists

07:08.410 --> 07:10.813
traveling Highway 12 late at night.

07:14.503 --> 07:16.550
Amongst all the legends and fables

07:16.550 --> 07:19.210
that make up the folk
law of the badger state,

07:19.210 --> 07:21.280
you'll also find records of encounters

07:21.280 --> 07:25.330
with ape like creatures that
date back to the mid 1800's,

07:25.330 --> 07:28.020
particularly in the wooded
sections of a state,

07:28.020 --> 07:30.160
mostly known for it's prairies.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.190
It's also been home to a handful of cults,

07:33.190 --> 07:35.600
most often near the city of Milwaukee

07:35.600 --> 07:39.340
which lies 46 miles north east of Elkhorn.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.940
Strangely the state of Wisconsin has also

07:41.940 --> 07:44.200
found itself embroiled in Satanic

07:44.200 --> 07:47.080
and ritualistic activity over the years,

07:47.080 --> 07:50.290
as recently as 2011 it
made national headlines

07:50.290 --> 07:52.570
when two women attempted to murder a man

07:52.570 --> 07:55.090
they'd lured to their Milwaukee apartment.

07:55.090 --> 07:57.560
They stabbed him over 300 times

07:57.560 --> 08:01.480
in what the victim claimed
was a Satanic ritual.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.200
Then there's the infamous
Slender Man stabbing

08:04.200 --> 08:05.840
which took place in waukesha,

08:05.840 --> 08:07.863
some thirty miles north of Elkhorn.

08:08.910 --> 08:11.510
In this case two 12 year old girls

08:11.510 --> 08:14.000
assaulted and nearly
killed one of their peers

08:14.000 --> 08:16.590
while trying to appease
what is essentially

08:16.590 --> 08:19.270
a fictional internet character.

08:19.270 --> 08:22.820
Perhaps Elkhorn with its
old fashioned city square

08:22.820 --> 08:25.830
and numerous churches
has avoided that aspect

08:25.830 --> 08:27.763
of the states tragic side.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.630
- People of Elkhorn run a wide gammit,

08:33.630 --> 08:38.630
we have farmers, a very
strong group of merchants,

08:39.510 --> 08:40.640
because the court house is there

08:40.640 --> 08:44.030
we have a lot of lawyers in the town.

08:44.030 --> 08:48.040
So it's a great mix of people, and again,

08:48.040 --> 08:49.510
it doesn't fit that stereotype,

08:49.510 --> 08:51.240
I'm sure there's one guy
walking around the square

08:51.240 --> 08:53.060
eating the cheese you know,

08:53.060 --> 08:57.483
but generally it's just
nice small town folks.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.710
- Just down Geneva Street

09:08.710 --> 09:12.900
through downtown Elkhorn
beyond the Highway 12 overpass

09:12.900 --> 09:17.190
lies an unassuming stretch
of blacktop called Bray Road.

09:17.190 --> 09:21.120
Bordered by farmland and the
occasional stands of trees

09:21.120 --> 09:23.910
the road runs nearly
perpendicular to Highway 12

09:23.910 --> 09:27.780
to the south west and
parallel to Highway 43

09:27.780 --> 09:29.653
which lies just to it's north.

09:30.850 --> 09:34.230
Until the 1960's, when
the highways were built

09:34.230 --> 09:37.170
Bray Road was rarely traveled by outsiders

09:37.170 --> 09:39.330
and we essentially a driveway for those

09:39.330 --> 09:42.143
that lived along its rough unpainted path.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.920
- The Bray family started moving here

09:45.920 --> 09:49.490
in the late 1890's and at one time

09:49.490 --> 09:51.990
there were four brothers
that all lived down here.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.380
My great grandfather
bought our farm in 1902

09:58.380 --> 10:00.710
and I believe he was the
last one of the brothers

10:00.710 --> 10:03.000
to move in this area.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.830
- It's interesting, Bray Road
is nothing scary looking,

10:06.830 --> 10:10.840
it's like going down any
farming road or rural road.

10:10.840 --> 10:14.260
Because it's farmers it's
all fifth generation farmers,

10:14.260 --> 10:18.010
they all know each other,
it's very privately owned,

10:18.010 --> 10:21.900
you can't just stop off on
the road and look around

10:21.900 --> 10:25.410
because you know one farmer's
gonna notify the other one,

10:25.410 --> 10:26.810
hey somebody's on your land.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.150
- I had discovered already
by some overlooked books

10:33.150 --> 10:36.420
that I found in the library that Bray Road

10:36.420 --> 10:39.470
at one time was a Native American trail

10:39.470 --> 10:44.030
that lead out to some other area of lakes

10:44.030 --> 10:46.160
that would have been summer places.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.670
- Just the way the road
kind of winds around

10:48.670 --> 10:52.780
down through here, it
was probably some sort

10:52.780 --> 10:54.590
of a trading trail at one time.

10:54.590 --> 10:56.410
Out in the middle of one of the fields,

10:56.410 --> 11:00.950
there was a remnants of an old
homestead and shack out there

11:00.950 --> 11:04.110
that had been used for
trading with the Indians.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.880
- Bray Road is
just over four miles long,

11:06.880 --> 11:09.790
within that stretch a
handful of country roads

11:09.790 --> 11:13.640
cross it's path, such as
Brookwood Lane, Plank Road,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.530
and Hospital Road.

11:15.530 --> 11:19.459
Coming from Elkhorn Bray
dead ends into Interstate 11.

11:19.459 --> 11:22.990
Acres of cornfields and
patchy woods are intermingled

11:22.990 --> 11:27.350
with farms, residential
houses and swampy marshlands.

11:27.350 --> 11:30.780
In the last 20 years the
only thing that's changed

11:30.780 --> 11:33.160
are the number of people
that visit the road

11:33.160 --> 11:35.210
hoping to catch sight of a creature

11:35.210 --> 11:37.480
that put Elkhorn on the world map

11:37.480 --> 11:39.257
nearly three decades ago.

11:46.850 --> 11:50.670
- It was December of
1991, and I'd been working

11:50.670 --> 11:53.080
for a short time as a newspaper reporter

11:53.080 --> 11:55.380
at a small countywide newspaper

11:55.380 --> 11:57.360
in Walworth County, Wisconsin.

11:57.360 --> 12:01.660
And it came to my attention
that there were people

12:01.660 --> 12:03.600
around my own home town of Elkhorn

12:03.600 --> 12:06.690
that were saying they had
seen what looked to them,

12:06.690 --> 12:10.470
like a werewolf along this
four mile stretch of road

12:10.470 --> 12:11.500
outside of Elkhorn.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.240
And I remember laughing
because it just seemed

12:14.240 --> 12:16.480
so ludicrous to me, and I mentioned it

12:16.480 --> 12:18.473
to our county animal control officer.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.700
- My name is John Frederickson,

12:21.700 --> 12:25.890
I believe it was back in 1986,

12:25.890 --> 12:28.130
that's when I first became
involved with the whole

12:28.130 --> 12:30.170
animal welfare, I was appointed

12:30.170 --> 12:32.910
the Walworth County humane
officer at that time.

12:32.910 --> 12:36.445
Primarily to investigate
crimes against animals

12:36.445 --> 12:41.044
and enforce state statutes
and county ordinance.

12:41.044 --> 12:43.230
- And I said, have you
heard what people are saying

12:43.230 --> 12:46.520
about there being this
big canine type thing,

12:46.520 --> 12:48.820
they're calling it a
werewolf out on Bray Road?

12:48.820 --> 12:51.160
- There was kind of a freelance reporter,

12:51.160 --> 12:52.060
Linda Kelp.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.964
The one freelance reporter had found out

12:53.964 --> 12:57.092
what Lori Endrezzi had seen,

12:57.092 --> 13:02.092
and from there I believe
it went to Linda Godfrey.

13:05.624 --> 13:10.520
And I believe at that time I
had invited Lori Endrezzi in

13:10.520 --> 13:12.260
to talk to her about her sightings,

13:12.260 --> 13:14.950
and at that time I made a manila folder

13:14.950 --> 13:17.360
marked werewolf and that's kind of where

13:17.360 --> 13:19.497
the whole werewolf folder comes in there.

13:19.497 --> 13:21.350
- And he opened up his desk drawer,

13:21.350 --> 13:24.109
pulled out a manila file folder
that was marker werewolf,

13:24.109 --> 13:26.900
or labeled werewolf and at that moment

13:26.900 --> 13:28.300
is when it became news really

13:28.300 --> 13:30.300
because when you've got a county official

13:30.300 --> 13:33.173
with a file folder marked
werewolf that's news.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.120
- There was the one sighting,

13:36.120 --> 13:39.187
when somebody was traveling
down I43 right by Delavan here

13:39.187 --> 13:42.470
and they got off at the
Delavan exit and some large

13:42.470 --> 13:44.653
creature ran right in front of their car.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.500
And then there were the so
called sightings on Bray Road.

13:50.500 --> 13:54.220
- He showed me the contents,
it was notes he'd written

13:54.220 --> 13:56.460
from people who were indeed phoning him

13:56.460 --> 13:59.370
and saying I don't know what it was,

13:59.370 --> 14:04.010
I saw this thing, if I had to
say it looked like a werewolf

14:04.010 --> 14:07.450
because it had the head of
a wolf or German Shepherd,

14:07.450 --> 14:10.713
it was huge, it stood and
ran on it's hind legs.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.710
- And I believe there was a story,

14:15.710 --> 14:20.030
a mother walking down the road
with her child or children.

14:20.030 --> 14:23.650
Up ahead the road a deer
came running across the road

14:23.650 --> 14:27.120
then behind it some creature on two legs

14:27.120 --> 14:28.170
was chasing the deer.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.730
Nothing too elaborate,
nothing that could be

14:32.730 --> 14:33.973
confirmed obviously.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.730
- I began to call upon
these people and when I went

14:37.730 --> 14:40.370
to interview them in person I discovered

14:40.370 --> 14:43.060
I did not think that they were crazy

14:43.060 --> 14:45.070
or trying to hoax something.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.280
They came from a very wide demographic,

14:47.280 --> 14:50.100
they were older, younger, male, female,

14:50.100 --> 14:51.730
blue collar, white collar.

14:51.730 --> 14:54.930
So it was a diverse group, I thought well,

14:54.930 --> 14:56.870
there's something,
they're seeing something.

14:56.870 --> 14:58.780
I didn't know what it was.

14:58.780 --> 15:03.720
- A typical report is a
biped walking humanoid dog

15:03.720 --> 15:07.150
with the muzzle, with the ears,

15:07.150 --> 15:10.940
about seven to eight feet tall, hairy,

15:10.940 --> 15:14.460
hands like, I don't want
to say like a human,

15:14.460 --> 15:17.210
but humanoid hands with claws.

15:17.210 --> 15:19.900
- It had the head of a
wolf or German shepherd,

15:19.900 --> 15:23.210
it was huge, it stood and
ran on it's hind legs.

15:23.210 --> 15:26.520
- They said fangs and the
red eyes, the pointy ears,

15:26.520 --> 15:28.770
almost like a German shepherd,

15:28.770 --> 15:32.010
but it's standing up on two
legs, and it's ginormous,

15:32.010 --> 15:33.950
it's taller than any person.

15:33.950 --> 15:36.210
- Covered with fur, long snout,

15:36.210 --> 15:39.051
and it's legs were bent
backwards like a dogs.

15:39.051 --> 15:42.490
- And just ferocious looking,
something that people say

15:42.490 --> 15:44.860
is a complete nightmare to see.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.920
- One thing I've noticed
is that the closer

15:46.920 --> 15:49.900
in time it is between the sighting

15:49.900 --> 15:52.450
and their reporting it to
me the more I still see

15:52.450 --> 15:55.530
that fear response and I
will actually sometimes

15:55.530 --> 15:58.090
just see people reliving
the fear, they turn white,

15:58.090 --> 16:00.190
they turn red, they start sweating.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.850
I've had one woman even burst into tears

16:02.850 --> 16:05.120
while she's telling me because they still

16:05.120 --> 16:09.533
feel this sort of visceral
contact with this creature.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.550
- On Halloween night 1991

16:27.550 --> 16:29.620
Doris Gibson had what would become known

16:29.620 --> 16:31.700
as the first publicly recorded sighting

16:31.700 --> 16:34.547
of the Beast of Bray Road.

16:34.547 --> 16:37.340
Her experience would launch
a rash of reported sightings

16:37.340 --> 16:39.340
around Walworth County.

16:39.340 --> 16:42.440
- She was a senior in
high school at the time

16:42.440 --> 16:45.023
and was driving down Bray Road,

16:46.520 --> 16:49.860
she felt like this muffled thump,

16:49.860 --> 16:51.910
and she was afraid that
she'd hit somebody's dog,

16:51.910 --> 16:54.193
or ran over an animal or something.

17:13.176 --> 17:16.859
She said I saw this thing,
I don't know what it was

17:16.859 --> 17:18.022
but it was big,

17:23.359 --> 17:24.790
and it started running for me.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.180
She said I could hear it's feet

17:26.180 --> 17:28.363
on the asphalt boom, boom,

17:32.976 --> 17:34.830
it actually lunged for her car

17:34.830 --> 17:39.050
and scraped its claws
on the trunk of the car.

17:39.050 --> 17:42.230
And she showed this to me,
I remember examining it

17:42.230 --> 17:46.510
and they were consistent
with two sets of claws

17:46.510 --> 17:49.110
clawing their way down
the back of the car,

17:49.110 --> 17:51.910
and that was one of the things
that scared her so badly.

17:54.870 --> 17:57.180
- Shortly
after Gibson's sighting

17:57.180 --> 17:59.697
a Milwaukee teen Tom Brichta would have

17:59.697 --> 18:02.143
his own encounter with
the Beast of Bray Road.

18:04.460 --> 18:08.490
- My name is Tom Brichta, I
live in Tremaine, Oklahoma

18:08.490 --> 18:12.290
on highway C, it was a Saturday night,

18:12.290 --> 18:16.553
late July, early August
and I was coming home

18:16.553 --> 18:19.990
from a wedding reception,
I had my friend Scott

18:19.990 --> 18:23.460
and my friend Chris from
Hanover Park Illinois

18:23.460 --> 18:26.640
in the car with me, it was very foggy,

18:26.640 --> 18:29.960
we could barely see two
car lengths ahead of you.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.020
And we started smelling this funny odor,

18:33.020 --> 18:35.220
this real foul smelling odor

18:35.220 --> 18:38.690
like this skunky kind of smell.

18:38.690 --> 18:42.907
I had noticed a hand
sticking out into the road,

18:42.907 --> 18:45.750
and my friend had noticed me looking out

18:45.750 --> 18:48.910
on the side of the road, and he had looked

18:48.910 --> 18:51.650
and he had seen whatever it was,

18:51.650 --> 18:53.850
it was huge, it was really large,

18:53.850 --> 18:58.850
it was whitish, gray and
black, streaks in it.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.730
It was hairy, it was
reaching out towards my car,

19:03.730 --> 19:07.803
it scratched a small piece
of pin striping from my car.

19:09.970 --> 19:12.750
The fingers were either pointed or had

19:12.750 --> 19:14.430
quite the nails on them, I did not get

19:14.430 --> 19:17.920
any facial detail but it was frightening,

19:17.920 --> 19:19.660
it was very frightening.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.617
And now as long as I think about this,

19:22.617 --> 19:24.260
not a day goes by that I don't,

19:24.260 --> 19:27.313
and I know a day won't go by
that I won't think about it.

19:29.130 --> 19:31.230
I can remember like it was just yesterday.

19:39.350 --> 19:42.450
- Another one was Lori Endrezzi,

19:42.450 --> 19:45.110
at the time she was a young single mother

19:45.110 --> 19:48.150
and she was a bar manager in town,

19:48.150 --> 19:50.663
and was driving home from work.

20:00.890 --> 20:03.200
She suddenly, her attention
was drawn to something

20:03.200 --> 20:04.103
in the ditch.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.370
- From what she had said
something was kneeling down,

20:20.370 --> 20:22.420
crouched over on the side of the road,

20:22.420 --> 20:24.677
eating, some type of roadkill.

20:24.677 --> 20:26.940
- She said it was actually kneeling

20:26.940 --> 20:30.060
in a way that she didn't
think a canine could kneel.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.620
And the other weird thing
is that it was holding

20:32.620 --> 20:34.797
some type of road kill animal.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.970
It frightened her very, very deeply,

20:50.970 --> 20:53.460
and she said that she spent a lot of time

20:53.460 --> 20:57.137
at the library looking for
what it might have been,

20:57.137 --> 21:00.613
and it didn't match any natural
wolf pictures she had seen.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.330
Now she actually, she was one of the ones

21:03.330 --> 21:05.630
that had called John Frederickson,

21:05.630 --> 21:09.360
and she went to his office
to talk to him about it.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.194
- We were discussing different
things that it may have been.

21:13.194 --> 21:16.960
It was something of the
natural order of nature,

21:16.960 --> 21:20.077
such as some type of animal,
being a coyote or wolf,

21:20.077 --> 21:24.510
and there happened random wolf
sightings around that time.

21:24.510 --> 21:26.810
If it wasn't something along
the natural order of nature

21:26.810 --> 21:31.090
then possibly could have
been something along

21:31.090 --> 21:33.970
the supernatural realm of things.

21:33.970 --> 21:38.260
- He had a row of books on the
shelf behind him at his desk,

21:38.260 --> 21:40.550
and when they started talking about this,

21:40.550 --> 21:43.050
the books started flying off the shelf.

21:43.050 --> 21:45.620
- Not too long into the
conversation some books

21:45.620 --> 21:48.967
that were up on a bookshelf
just came flying down,

21:48.967 --> 21:51.150
and there really wasn't
any cause for the books

21:51.150 --> 21:52.630
to go flying off the shelf.

21:52.630 --> 21:55.083
So that was the end of that conversation.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.200
- It was just a one off
story as far as I knew,

22:10.200 --> 22:13.380
I did this quick drawing
because I was also

22:13.380 --> 22:16.290
the illustrator and
cartoonist for the newspaper,

22:16.290 --> 22:19.410
and it ran, and that
was when it all began.

22:19.410 --> 22:24.180
Within days and even weeks
people were contacting

22:24.180 --> 22:27.610
the newspaper office, but
the media were starting

22:27.610 --> 22:30.310
to catch on to it, it was just astounding.

22:30.310 --> 22:33.570
Nobody expected that
sort of reaction to it.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.540
- It was a pretty good
joke up and down the road.

22:35.540 --> 22:37.550
- My family actually
struggled with it a little bit

22:37.550 --> 22:40.070
because this kind of popped up

22:40.070 --> 22:42.260
right after my Father had died.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.900
So my mom was just getting
used to living on the farm,

22:44.900 --> 22:46.970
in the house, by herself,
and all these lights

22:46.970 --> 22:48.210
were flashing around the buildings,

22:48.210 --> 22:49.620
and people walking up and down the road.

22:49.620 --> 22:53.420
So we went from kind of
amusement to kind of upset,

22:53.420 --> 22:55.360
to well okay it's just a deal,

22:55.360 --> 22:57.510
just kind of had fun
with it after a while.

22:59.070 --> 23:01.040
- I remember my editor
and I had talked about it

23:01.040 --> 23:04.008
and said yeah local people
will have fun with it

23:04.008 --> 23:05.620
for a couple of weeks and
then it will just go away.

23:05.620 --> 23:08.097
And nothing could have been
further from the truth.

23:08.097 --> 23:10.533
It had legs, no pun intended.

23:12.337 --> 23:14.580
The story just stuck and
grew bigger and bigger.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.607
- Yeah, I believe when the paper came out

23:16.607 --> 23:20.340
and the story came out,
that's when I think the more,

23:20.340 --> 23:23.450
I don't want to say the
panic, but the fear set in.

23:23.450 --> 23:27.720
- The people that had
actual sightings obviously,

23:27.720 --> 23:29.658
I believe a lot of those people did have

23:29.658 --> 23:32.890
an actual fear of what they had seen.

23:32.890 --> 23:35.733
Not knowing quite how to rationalize it.

23:37.420 --> 23:40.000
- Of course there was a lot of ribbing,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.313
and teasing of people who
said they had seen it.

23:44.170 --> 23:45.680
The local sheriffs
department's talking about

23:45.680 --> 23:48.057
silver bullets and
whatnot, and that they were

23:48.057 --> 23:51.980
making silver bullets in case
they ran across the beast,

23:51.980 --> 23:52.960
or whatever.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.910
- Some of the witnesses,
because they later came forward

23:55.910 --> 23:58.850
with their actual identity
said they wish they hadn't

23:58.850 --> 23:59.963
come forward with it.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.880
But on the other hand
there were other people

24:02.880 --> 24:05.810
who had secretly seen
it, and were then saying,

24:05.810 --> 24:09.200
yeah it's right, it is there I've seen it.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.005
- On December 29th, 1991,

24:12.005 --> 24:14.820
Godfrey's article detailing
the initial sightings

24:14.820 --> 24:16.030
of the Beast of Bray Road

24:16.030 --> 24:19.330
ran in The Week a Delavan newspaper.

24:19.330 --> 24:21.380
Almost immediately the story kicked up

24:21.380 --> 24:24.120
a flurry of activity around the area.

24:24.120 --> 24:27.220
Perhaps most notably were a
string of calls and letters

24:27.220 --> 24:29.070
to the newspaper from witnesses

24:29.070 --> 24:31.130
who had seen similar creatures.

24:31.130 --> 24:33.430
Many of the witnesses
were from other towns,

24:33.430 --> 24:36.880
counties and even states who
wished to express to Godfrey

24:36.880 --> 24:40.480
the seriousness in which
the story should be handled.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.750
The first inkling of the
larger scope of this phenomenon

24:43.750 --> 24:46.520
was beginning to take
shape in Linda's mind,

24:46.520 --> 24:49.290
even as the story of the Bray Road Beast

24:49.290 --> 24:51.837
began to take on a life of it's own.

24:55.490 --> 24:59.950
In September of 1991,
Scott Bray, a local farmer,

24:59.950 --> 25:01.920
had a sighting of what he referred to

25:01.920 --> 25:04.600
as an abnormally large dog or wolf

25:04.600 --> 25:07.050
in the field behind his house.

25:07.050 --> 25:10.360
Scott described the animal as
taller than a German shepherd

25:10.360 --> 25:14.420
with pointed ears, a tail,
long gray and black hair,

25:14.420 --> 25:17.480
and a massive muscular build.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.270
Around the same time as
the Scott Bray sighting,

25:20.270 --> 25:23.030
another Elkhorn local named Russell Guest,

25:23.030 --> 25:25.320
spotted a creature near Bray Road,

25:25.320 --> 25:29.000
walking briefly on two legs
before dropping to all fours

25:29.000 --> 25:30.850
in an aggressive stance.

25:30.850 --> 25:32.730
Guest turned and ran from the creature

25:32.730 --> 25:36.010
which he described as being
larger than a german shepherd

25:36.010 --> 25:39.780
with black and grayish hair
and around five feet tall

25:39.780 --> 25:41.773
when it was standing on two legs.

25:43.200 --> 25:47.340
On January 8th 1991,
Robert Bushman and his wife

25:47.340 --> 25:50.480
spotted a large black
animal running on all fours,

25:50.480 --> 25:53.860
chasing a deer just down
the road from Elkhorn.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.070
The couple were driving on I43

25:56.070 --> 25:59.850
near Delavan in broad daylight
when the sighting occurred.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.490
They described the animal
as being far too large

26:02.490 --> 26:05.260
to be a wolf but were
unable to give a thorough

26:05.260 --> 26:08.163
description due to the
speed which it was running.

26:11.140 --> 26:14.260
As sightings continued
Godfrey received other reports

26:14.260 --> 26:15.930
from witnesses who claimed to have seen

26:15.930 --> 26:18.470
the same creature decades earlier.

26:18.470 --> 26:20.970
Strangely the oldest reported sighting

26:20.970 --> 26:24.130
was also the first to hint
at a more sinister origin

26:24.130 --> 26:25.480
for the Beast of Bray Road.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.966
- One of the most
surprising and interesting

26:31.966 --> 26:35.520
accounts that I received
happened right after

26:35.520 --> 26:37.030
the first stories broke,

26:37.030 --> 26:38.670
this happened not in Walworth County

26:38.670 --> 26:40.770
but in the adjacent Jefferson County,

26:40.770 --> 26:42.270
which isn't all that far away.

26:43.130 --> 26:46.080
A newspaper editor called me and said,

26:46.080 --> 26:49.160
my dad saw this thing in 1936,

26:49.160 --> 26:51.710
and his father was the nightwatchman

26:51.710 --> 26:55.390
for St Coletta institute, which
was a Catholic institution

26:55.390 --> 26:58.913
for taking care of people
with special needs.

26:59.830 --> 27:03.580
They had preserved on
the grounds a number of

27:03.580 --> 27:06.640
ancient burial mounds, Mark
Shackleman was the name

27:06.640 --> 27:09.640
of the mans father and his job every night

27:09.640 --> 27:12.760
was to walk the whole grounds
with this big flashlight,

27:12.760 --> 27:16.640
and this one night he walked up on an area

27:16.640 --> 27:19.100
where there were several
mounds, and saw something

27:19.100 --> 27:21.030
large on top of one of the mounds.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.810
When he went and looked more closely

27:22.810 --> 27:25.870
he saw that it was
something that reminded him

27:25.870 --> 27:29.420
of a canine head but it was
a really large creature,

27:29.420 --> 27:32.660
and it was digging furiously
in the top of the mound

27:32.660 --> 27:34.230
as if it was trying to get something out

27:34.230 --> 27:35.583
that it knew was in there.

27:38.610 --> 27:41.740
He was shocked, the creature
was shocked and ran off

27:43.070 --> 27:45.650
but the next night he went back

27:45.650 --> 27:47.333
and the creature was there again.

27:48.370 --> 27:53.370
It stood up, faced him,
and made what sounded like,

27:53.750 --> 27:56.793
he described as sort of
a protohuman language,

27:58.200 --> 28:00.410
and what it sounded like to the man

28:00.410 --> 28:04.083
was the utterance of the word Gadara.

28:06.060 --> 28:09.720
Which if you go to the New
Testament in the Christian Bible

28:09.720 --> 28:12.000
you'll find that's the
place where there was a man

28:12.000 --> 28:15.400
who was filled with Demons,
and he was called the Gadarine

28:15.400 --> 28:17.100
because it was in the region of Gadara,

28:17.100 --> 28:20.620
and that was where Jesus cast
the Demons out of this man.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.910
And it's interesting
because I found out later

28:22.910 --> 28:26.110
that one of the priests
to the Catholic church

28:26.110 --> 28:29.550
that was kind of attached to
the St Coletta organization

28:29.550 --> 28:33.820
had very bad problems
after he exorcized a demon

28:33.820 --> 28:37.000
from a young person who
lived in that Parrish,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.300
and then the Demon attached itself to him.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.900
So you have this whole sort of tradition

28:41.900 --> 28:45.000
of Demonology possession going on,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.730
and then you get this
unknown creature standing up

28:49.730 --> 28:52.900
on an old burial mound,
and uttering a word

28:52.900 --> 28:56.470
that could have been the
Biblical word Gadara,

28:56.470 --> 28:59.373
and it's just very,
very strange happenings.

29:46.820 --> 29:49.230
- While Mark
Shacklemans 1930's encounter

29:49.230 --> 29:51.040
with a similarly strange beast

29:51.040 --> 29:53.330
may have aroused some suspicions of a more

29:53.330 --> 29:56.030
unearthly genesis for the phenomenon,

29:56.030 --> 29:58.730
it was Lori Endrezzi, the first witness

29:58.730 --> 30:01.270
of the Beast of Bray
Road in the modern era

30:01.270 --> 30:04.360
who drew a parallel between
the creature she had seen

30:04.360 --> 30:06.220
and an ancient evil.

30:06.220 --> 30:09.690
In an interview with Endrezzi
a few years after her sighting

30:09.690 --> 30:11.670
she professed her belief to Godfrey

30:11.670 --> 30:15.080
that the Beast of Bray
Road was Satanic in origin.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.793
A Demonic entity, perhaps,
the Dark Prince himself.

30:24.110 --> 30:26.077
The correlation between the canid creature

30:26.077 --> 30:29.520
and the black arts may
seem ludicrous to some.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.730
It was not as unbelievable
to some investigators

30:32.730 --> 30:35.040
and it wouldn't be the last
time that a witness felt

30:35.040 --> 30:37.310
instead of an undiscovered animal,

30:37.310 --> 30:40.803
they had come face to
face with evil incarnate.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.660
- In my opinion there is
a dark side to this world.

30:44.660 --> 30:46.760
So with some of these sightings they're

30:46.760 --> 30:48.800
part of the natural order of nature,

30:48.800 --> 30:50.680
and it was some animal,
some type of animal,

30:50.680 --> 30:52.570
that's easily believable.

30:52.570 --> 30:57.010
Or I wouldn't doubt if it
could have been something

30:57.010 --> 31:00.070
along the supernatural
realm of things also

31:00.070 --> 31:05.070
from what I had experienced
during those days.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.140
- With the Beast of Bray Road

31:10.140 --> 31:12.670
making it's presence known around the area

31:12.670 --> 31:14.670
local media were tied up in a story

31:14.670 --> 31:18.160
that went back even further
then the first known sightings.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.410
That of a local Satanic cult,

31:20.410 --> 31:22.700
rumored to be holding
meetings in the forested

31:22.700 --> 31:25.100
areas of Walworth County.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.410
During the late 80s and
early 90s John Frederickson

31:28.410 --> 31:31.700
was called to the scene of
multiple animal mutilations

31:31.700 --> 31:34.650
including one in which
dozens of mutilated bodies

31:34.650 --> 31:35.650
had been discovered.

31:36.550 --> 31:39.410
While local police insisted
the site was nothing more

31:39.410 --> 31:41.980
then a bone yard for local livestock

31:41.980 --> 31:44.010
Frederickson recognized the potential

31:44.010 --> 31:46.570
for more ritualistic causes of death,

31:46.570 --> 31:48.570
when he discovered many of the carcasses

31:48.570 --> 31:50.940
had been subject to gruesome treatment

31:50.940 --> 31:53.760
that involved the removal of organs.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.050
However, the local police
bulldozed the location

31:57.050 --> 31:59.973
before a thorough investigation
could be completed.

32:00.910 --> 32:03.650
Many ritualistic beliefs
revolve around the notion

32:03.650 --> 32:06.850
of conjuring an entity,
occasionally a Demon

32:06.850 --> 32:11.070
for nefarious purposes, as
John Frederickson discovered,

32:11.070 --> 32:14.035
the link between the Beast
of Bray Road and Satanism

32:14.035 --> 32:18.290
might not be as far removed
as it may at first appeared.

32:18.290 --> 32:21.430
In the early 1990's John
received a phone call

32:21.430 --> 32:23.540
from an anonymous source who stated

32:23.540 --> 32:26.710
that she was aware of
illicit, cult like gatherings

32:26.710 --> 32:28.243
taking place in the area.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.730
- At that time there was actually

32:31.730 --> 32:34.260
quite a bit of Satanic
information that was coming in.

32:34.260 --> 32:39.143
Some of it was obviously
teenager type involvement,

32:40.480 --> 32:43.530
their dabbling into Devil worship,

32:43.530 --> 32:46.230
and there were a couple other places

32:46.230 --> 32:49.830
that were a little more
intense, with an older crowd,

32:49.830 --> 32:54.830
adult crowd, that took the
whole role of Satanic religion

32:55.240 --> 32:56.570
serious and whatnot.

32:56.570 --> 33:01.570
Anything from teachers to
possible law enforcement

33:01.807 --> 33:03.763
people being involved.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.350
Yeah I guess some of their get togethers

33:09.350 --> 33:12.710
at this one location were quite involved.

33:12.710 --> 33:16.120
People from around the
world actually would show up

33:16.120 --> 33:17.770
and they would go back into the woods

33:17.770 --> 33:21.339
and have their little ritualistic
ceremonies and whatnot.

33:28.150 --> 33:29.700
Walworth County I had found out

33:29.700 --> 33:33.220
from a higher law enforcement department

33:33.220 --> 33:36.440
who one day just showing
up out of nowhere,

33:36.440 --> 33:38.270
and introduced himself to me.

33:38.270 --> 33:42.400
Filled me in on some
of the Satanic activity

33:43.370 --> 33:45.940
happening around the entire state,

33:45.940 --> 33:49.010
and I think there was
three of four counties

33:49.010 --> 33:54.010
that were notorious for occult
activity, Satanic activity.

33:54.060 --> 33:56.120
And I was somewhat surprised
that Walworth County

33:56.120 --> 33:57.770
just happened to be one of those.

34:01.130 --> 34:05.810
- The wolf is seen as the
symbol of greed and consumption,

34:05.810 --> 34:09.040
and probably because it
has such a violent nature

34:09.040 --> 34:12.750
it's seen as this chaotic force in society

34:12.750 --> 34:16.480
that kinds of threatens
stability in the culture.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.260
And this is often done
through the abuse of science

34:19.260 --> 34:22.030
or the abuse of magic or technology.

34:22.030 --> 34:27.030
And it creates what's called
the abhuman, which is not human

34:27.219 --> 34:29.464
and it's basically an individual that has

34:29.464 --> 34:34.464
lost the ability to control
themselves and their desires,

34:35.090 --> 34:36.760
and in some cases they can't control

34:36.760 --> 34:38.840
whether they change into
this creature or not.

34:38.840 --> 34:43.840
- I wouldn't discount,
again from my experiences,

34:44.409 --> 34:47.023
and seeing what I've seen and what not.

34:47.023 --> 34:52.023
I wouldn't totally rule out
some type of occult activity

34:53.510 --> 34:56.870
if by chance somebody invoked some type

34:56.870 --> 35:00.433
of a occult type beast.

35:09.520 --> 35:10.960
- Throughout history we find

35:10.960 --> 35:14.410
many legends and lore
pertaining to canid creatures.

35:14.410 --> 35:17.210
In Egyptian hieroglyphics
we learn of Anubis,

35:17.210 --> 35:19.880
God of the dead, a jackal headed creature

35:19.880 --> 35:23.730
who decided which souls should
pass on to the afterlife.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.500
In the Bible's old testament,

35:25.500 --> 35:28.380
a king by the name of
Neberkenezer was exiled

35:28.380 --> 35:30.250
from his kingdom and forced to wander

35:30.250 --> 35:33.230
the forest and fields as a wild beast,

35:33.230 --> 35:35.163
cursed to live like a wolf.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.660
Norse mythology has
it's own representation

35:39.660 --> 35:42.240
of the werewolf in the
form of the ancient saga

35:42.240 --> 35:44.750
of the Volsungs, which tells the story

35:44.750 --> 35:47.320
of a father and son who discovered pelts

35:47.320 --> 35:48.900
which gave the wearer the power

35:48.900 --> 35:52.000
to become a wolf for 10 days.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.420
Donning the pelts the duo turned into

35:54.420 --> 35:56.830
blood thirsty savage creatures

35:56.830 --> 35:59.040
and went on a killing rampage.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.780
Engulfed in blood lust
the father eventually

36:01.780 --> 36:04.440
attacked his own son pointing to something

36:04.440 --> 36:08.220
which has since become a
vital part of werewolf tales,

36:08.220 --> 36:09.803
the loss of control.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.360
Across the world the
werewolf has found a home

36:14.360 --> 36:15.970
in nearly every culture.

36:15.970 --> 36:18.810
- In the epic of Gilgamesh,
which is written about 2000BC

36:18.810 --> 36:22.421
you had this interesting
character called Incadu,

36:22.421 --> 36:24.140
which is sort of a wild
man, he's covered in hair,

36:24.140 --> 36:27.520
he's got long hair, and
he lives with the animals.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.950
He ends up battling Gilgamesh,

36:29.950 --> 36:34.950
who's the hero of the story and
they're equal strength wise.

36:34.990 --> 36:38.040
But Gilgamesh wins
because, arguably because

36:38.040 --> 36:40.943
he's educated and part of civilization.

36:41.792 --> 36:44.510
Incadu becomes Gilgamesh's servant

36:44.510 --> 36:47.579
and there's this sort of
running theme throughout

36:47.579 --> 36:50.430
Western literature of
that sort of animal nature

36:50.430 --> 36:51.920
needing to be sublimated.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.030
- In the very beginning when
I wrote the story about it

36:55.030 --> 36:58.130
I was just sort of thinking
what would I call this.

36:58.130 --> 37:00.800
It was a thing that was very hard to name.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.200
I didn't want to call it the werewolf

37:02.200 --> 37:05.690
because right away I didn't
believe it was a werewolf,

37:05.690 --> 37:10.060
so I titled it the Beast of
Bray Road and it just stuck.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.540
But it doesn't mean, I know now,

37:12.540 --> 37:17.280
that there's only one
thing out on one road.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.600
The descriptions people
gave of the Michigan dog man

37:20.600 --> 37:22.330
were no different then the descriptions

37:22.330 --> 37:25.110
people gave of the Beast of Bray Road.

37:25.110 --> 37:28.140
- I believe that the
werewolf lore had to have,

37:28.140 --> 37:31.850
it started somewhere,
and every lore or myth

37:31.850 --> 37:34.410
has some truth to it, so I do believe

37:34.410 --> 37:37.200
that anything in the United Kingdom,

37:37.200 --> 37:39.600
I think we're seeing the
same thing, personally.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.440
- Well anybody who studied
the Middle Ages in Europe

37:44.440 --> 37:47.750
knows that there were alleged werewolves.

37:47.750 --> 37:50.900
There are other accounts
of so called werewolves

37:50.900 --> 37:54.000
in those same middle ages
that were considered occult

37:54.000 --> 37:56.730
and tied to witchcraft.

37:56.730 --> 37:59.300
If you admitted you were a werewolf,

37:59.300 --> 38:03.380
or somebody could prove
that you were a werewolf,

38:03.380 --> 38:06.620
you were dead meat, you would
be executed in most cases

38:06.620 --> 38:09.180
for the years that these
trials were going on

38:09.180 --> 38:10.550
at their greatest height.

38:10.550 --> 38:13.450
- In Germany for instance, in 1589,

38:13.450 --> 38:15.870
you got what's called
the werewolf of Bedburg,

38:15.870 --> 38:19.360
and a guy named Peter
Stubb evidently had fangs,

38:19.360 --> 38:22.680
and claimed to have a
desire for human blood.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.420
Claimed to have murdered some 16 people,

38:25.420 --> 38:28.280
he was put on trial
and found to be guilty.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.250
- There was the Beast of
Gevaudan, probably the most famous

38:31.250 --> 38:33.660
and in that case it's very different

38:33.660 --> 38:35.320
from these Bray Road sightings

38:35.320 --> 38:40.150
because the Bray Road beast
would duck and run for cover

38:40.150 --> 38:42.653
after it had been seen by people.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.600
But back in the Middle Ages, this thing,

38:46.600 --> 38:49.703
was killing dozens and dozens
of people and livestock.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.430
It was some real animal, real killer.

38:54.430 --> 38:56.720
- This is in Southern France,

38:56.720 --> 39:01.260
between June 1764 and June 1767,

39:01.260 --> 39:04.360
there are reports of this giant wolf

39:04.360 --> 39:07.863
over 200 attacks, some
half of which were lethal.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.583
The victims tended to be disemboweled,

39:21.070 --> 39:24.653
clothes were taken off, and
throats cut and beheaded.

39:26.680 --> 39:30.960
The death of the creature
finally came in June 1767,

39:30.960 --> 39:35.150
Jean Duhamel famously shot it with bullets

39:35.150 --> 39:37.270
that were supposedly made
from a silver chalice

39:37.270 --> 39:39.236
that had been blessed by a priest.

39:39.236 --> 39:41.525
So that's sort of where the
idea of the silver bullet

39:41.525 --> 39:44.260
killing the werewolf comes from.

39:44.260 --> 39:47.450
- So it seems to me like a
very different phenomenon

39:47.450 --> 39:49.350
that was happening back then,

39:49.350 --> 39:52.050
where you have lots of
predation of both livestock

39:52.050 --> 39:54.460
and human beings, and
animals that were able

39:54.460 --> 39:58.063
to be shot and captured and exhibited.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.760
- In America Native Indian lore

40:01.760 --> 40:04.700
involving wolves and man
wolves has been ignored

40:04.700 --> 40:07.170
by many paranormal researchers.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.690
The Mohawk Indians believe
that some of the tribe

40:09.690 --> 40:12.460
could shift form into other creatures.

40:12.460 --> 40:15.420
They referred to them as the Limakin,

40:15.420 --> 40:18.627
in the Western United States,
perhaps it is the Navajo

40:18.627 --> 40:20.560
who are best known for their legends

40:20.560 --> 40:24.240
of shape-shifting men
known as skin-walkers.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.290
- Especially the Navajo
where you had this evil witch

40:27.290 --> 40:30.410
that's able to change into a wolf,

40:30.410 --> 40:32.170
or some other type of animal.

40:32.170 --> 40:35.570
And typically they acquire this capability

40:35.570 --> 40:39.440
by committing some type
of taboo like using magic

40:39.440 --> 40:41.670
to curse someone instead
of healing someone.

40:41.670 --> 40:45.800
So they sort of contrast with
the healer or the medicine man

40:45.800 --> 40:49.530
so as a result they're sort
of a paria to that culture.

40:49.530 --> 40:53.090
- Wisconsin had a great
number of different

40:53.090 --> 40:54.910
Native American tribes living here.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.210
When I asked them what they thought

40:56.210 --> 41:00.410
the true nature of these
upright canines were,

41:00.410 --> 41:04.090
they said well, we believe that these

41:04.090 --> 41:07.650
are not normal, usual modern animals.

41:07.650 --> 41:10.700
That they're very old, that
they were here before we were,

41:10.700 --> 41:13.163
and that that came from the spirit world.

41:16.070 --> 41:18.210
- All of these stories tend to

41:18.210 --> 41:23.210
focus on mankind's either
abusing technology,

41:23.580 --> 41:26.500
or going to a place where he
should not in the first place,

41:26.500 --> 41:29.230
or investigating beyond
where he should be.

41:29.230 --> 41:30.900
Typically this awakes the monster,

41:30.900 --> 41:32.230
or brings the monster about,

41:32.230 --> 41:35.400
or changes the human being into a monster.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.850
We have this facade of being civilized

41:38.850 --> 41:41.300
and cordial to one another,

41:41.300 --> 41:42.613
but there's always that sort of

41:42.613 --> 41:46.020
that inner animal that
can surface at any point.

41:46.020 --> 41:50.030
And monsters sort of allow
us to experience that

41:50.030 --> 41:51.723
without it actually happening.

42:10.010 --> 42:12.410
- As time
passed the local reaction

42:12.410 --> 42:15.330
had exceeded Linda Godfrey's expectations,

42:15.330 --> 42:18.383
placing her at the center
of a werewolf whirlwind.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.320
Reporters from no less
than four Milwaukee based

42:22.320 --> 42:24.720
television stations appeared in Elkhorn,

42:24.720 --> 42:27.710
looking for Godfrey, as
well as any eye witnesses

42:27.710 --> 42:30.720
that would go on record and of course

42:30.720 --> 42:33.350
the Bray Road Beast itself.

42:33.350 --> 42:36.450
Radio and wire services
carried the terrifying tales

42:36.450 --> 42:39.540
beyond the Wisconsin border and in no time

42:39.540 --> 42:42.410
a modern legend roared to life.

42:42.410 --> 42:45.490
Curiosity seekers arrived
in Lafayette Township

42:45.490 --> 42:48.060
for the express purpose
of driving up and down

42:48.060 --> 42:51.910
Bray Road in hopes of
seeing a hairy monster.

42:51.910 --> 42:54.800
Nationally televised
programs such as Sightings

42:54.800 --> 42:57.840
and Inside Edition devoted
segments of their shows

42:57.840 --> 42:59.930
to the Walworth County werewolf,

42:59.930 --> 43:03.990
thrusting the story into
even greater prominence.

43:03.990 --> 43:07.780
Linda Godfrey's files began
to swell with sighting reports

43:07.780 --> 43:11.070
and she found herself becoming
the unlikely spokesperson

43:11.070 --> 43:14.270
for a phenomenon that defied reason.

43:14.270 --> 43:18.260
And then after the major
waves of publicity had crested

43:18.260 --> 43:21.550
and the attention given
to Elkhorn began to recede

43:21.550 --> 43:26.400
life along Bray Road slowly
regained it's quiet composure.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.860
Godfrey however, remained busy,

43:28.860 --> 43:30.890
the sheer volume of reports,

43:30.890 --> 43:33.030
the veracity of the eyewitnesses

43:33.030 --> 43:35.010
and the persistence since that something

43:35.010 --> 43:38.010
significant had occurred,
inspired her to write

43:38.010 --> 43:40.350
about the entire experience.

43:40.350 --> 43:44.610
In 2003, she released
the Beast of Bray Road,

43:44.610 --> 43:46.160
a book that traced the history

43:46.160 --> 43:48.232
of her involvement in the breaking story,

43:48.232 --> 43:51.080
detailed the most compelling sightings,

43:51.080 --> 43:54.940
and speculated about the
true nature of the dog man,

43:54.940 --> 43:56.750
in the wake of the books release

43:56.750 --> 43:58.630
there was a resurgence in sightings

43:58.630 --> 44:00.570
of bipedal wolf like creatures

44:00.570 --> 44:03.730
in the vicinity of Elkhorn and Bray Road.

44:03.730 --> 44:05.870
Almost all of these encounters took place

44:05.870 --> 44:08.000
as people were driving at night.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.790
Sometimes the canid was seen

44:09.790 --> 44:11.910
streaking through the cornfields.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.850
Other times across the road in front

44:13.850 --> 44:15.540
of the startled motorist,

44:15.540 --> 44:18.080
often giving it's distinctive sneer

44:18.080 --> 44:21.053
that terrorizes those
unfortunate enough to see it.

44:22.020 --> 44:24.660
In one unforgettable case, a creature,

44:24.660 --> 44:27.690
described as larger
than an Irish wolf hound

44:27.690 --> 44:31.100
kept pace with a car for well over a mile.

44:31.100 --> 44:35.693
The vehicle was traveling at
a speed of 55 miles per hour.

44:36.630 --> 44:39.380
While the Beast of Bray Road
and Godfrey's subsequent

44:39.380 --> 44:41.560
writing opened a door for many witnesses

44:41.560 --> 44:45.670
to discuss their confrontations,
often for the first time.

44:45.670 --> 44:47.650
Still others could not being themselves

44:47.650 --> 44:49.740
to talk about what they had seen.

44:49.740 --> 44:51.410
Either they did not want to accept

44:51.410 --> 44:53.680
that such a thing could really exist,

44:53.680 --> 44:57.560
or they were even more
fearful of being ridiculed.

44:57.560 --> 45:00.590
- The thing is a lot of
people stopped going public

45:00.590 --> 45:02.110
with their sightings because they saw

45:02.110 --> 45:04.270
how the first ones were made fun of,

45:04.270 --> 45:06.300
and they didn't want to lose their jobs

45:06.300 --> 45:08.160
or be made fun of themselves.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.810
- As soon as there came out
the Elkhorn in the paper

45:10.810 --> 45:13.840
it went national, now all of a sudden

45:13.840 --> 45:15.560
everybody's looking for this.

45:15.560 --> 45:18.830
So did it die down from
the early 90s till now?

45:18.830 --> 45:21.047
I don't think so, I just
think that there are a lot

45:21.047 --> 45:23.210
of people that aren't coming forward

45:23.210 --> 45:25.790
saying they saw something
in fear of ridicule.

45:25.790 --> 45:28.020
- I'm sure it'd be natural for somebody

45:28.020 --> 45:30.227
to have the wits scared out of them,

45:30.227 --> 45:33.410
maybe just tell some close friends but not

45:33.410 --> 45:35.560
want it to go public
or anything like that.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.233
No doubt.

45:43.370 --> 45:45.370
- As the mystery
of what was being seen

45:45.370 --> 45:48.530
in Elkhorn began to spread
to the rest of the country

45:48.530 --> 45:51.170
theories as to what could
explain the existence

45:51.170 --> 45:53.313
of such a creature began to formulate.

45:54.290 --> 45:55.510
While there was a precedence

45:55.510 --> 45:57.270
in the form of myths and legends

45:57.270 --> 46:00.940
relating to upright wolf
like beings around the world

46:00.940 --> 46:03.230
no one had postulated on the existence

46:03.230 --> 46:05.860
of such a being within the natural realm.

46:05.860 --> 46:08.620
Until Linda Godfrey's own investigations

46:08.620 --> 46:10.293
lead her to do just that.

46:11.340 --> 46:13.470
- One thing that I was
always trying to work with

46:13.470 --> 46:16.680
were the commonalities in
the descriptions from people

46:16.680 --> 46:19.000
and I realized that almost everybody

46:19.000 --> 46:21.600
was describing basically the same thing.

46:21.600 --> 46:25.164
Which was something that
stood five to seven feet tall,

46:25.164 --> 46:27.970
had that head like a
wolf or German shepherd,

46:27.970 --> 46:29.960
I called it the indigenous dog man

46:29.960 --> 46:33.000
because I was reasoning it
could have been something

46:33.000 --> 46:37.060
that was just a very minor mutation

46:37.060 --> 46:42.030
of slightly larger paws
and maybe some sort

46:42.030 --> 46:44.220
of adjustment in the spinal column.

46:44.220 --> 46:48.100
That perhaps it was advantageous for it

46:48.100 --> 46:50.730
to be able to stand up.

46:50.730 --> 46:54.780
If it's advantageous, and
then more of these reproduce,

46:54.780 --> 46:58.040
you know, it's the
natural law of adaptation,

46:58.040 --> 47:02.068
that more of them would persist
in these grassland areas.

47:02.068 --> 47:03.992
- In the snow we came
across this wolf print

47:03.992 --> 47:06.067
that was bigger then my hand,

47:06.067 --> 47:07.590
and there were several of them,

47:07.590 --> 47:10.400
and it is, it's frightening to see

47:10.400 --> 47:12.450
something that giant out there.

47:12.450 --> 47:14.730
- They're generally seen
running on all fours

47:14.730 --> 47:16.490
but people recognize them
as something different

47:16.490 --> 47:20.630
because they'll say they
were as big as a pony,

47:20.630 --> 47:23.380
a Shetland pony, or a calf.

47:23.380 --> 47:26.490
- Residents up here, they
know what wolves look like,

47:26.490 --> 47:28.443
dogs look like, coyotes look like.

47:31.650 --> 47:33.960
- Ricky Sanchez
has a vested interest

47:33.960 --> 47:36.870
in getting to the bottom
of the dog man enigma.

47:36.870 --> 47:38.750
That's because a pack of these creatures

47:38.750 --> 47:42.440
apparently frequents his
acreage near the Horicon Marsh

47:42.440 --> 47:46.550
located approximately 100
miles north of Bray Road.

47:46.550 --> 47:51.133
- 2017 is when it all
started at my property.

47:52.710 --> 47:55.230
It all started one night
around one of the o'clock.

47:55.230 --> 47:57.150
I walked outside with a head lamp,

47:57.150 --> 47:59.524
we don't have, like
we're out in the country,

47:59.524 --> 48:00.380
so there's no lights out,

48:00.380 --> 48:05.380
and I saw this large black
object in the property

48:06.340 --> 48:09.740
but beside the silhouette
which really could focus

48:09.740 --> 48:11.260
with the headlamps were the two eyes.

48:11.260 --> 48:13.398
Didn't really pay much attention to it

48:13.398 --> 48:14.607
because it was really low to the ground,

48:14.607 --> 48:15.440
so I kept walking towards the car.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.747
As I got to the trunk of
the car I glanced at again,

48:17.747 --> 48:21.540
and it was slowly walking
crouched down to the ground

48:21.540 --> 48:22.600
but towards me.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.090
So I'm trying to figure out what is this?

48:24.090 --> 48:26.660
So I walked towards it a little bit,

48:26.660 --> 48:30.450
and it walked backwards
while still looking at me.

48:30.450 --> 48:32.860
That sparked my curiosity because it was

48:32.860 --> 48:34.330
coming towards me, the
cat normally doesn't

48:34.330 --> 48:37.067
come towards me, I put
the headlamp on brighter

48:37.067 --> 48:38.510
and kind of walked towards it,

48:38.510 --> 48:41.833
and it tried to back in the same position.

48:45.540 --> 48:47.083
So I walked towards it more and it kept on

48:47.083 --> 48:50.100
walking backwards and backwards
while still looking at me,

48:50.100 --> 48:52.030
and still looking at me walked back until

48:52.030 --> 48:53.960
it reached one of the
trees on the property.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.980
Flipped up, looked at me, now
it's eyes shine at my height

48:56.980 --> 49:00.263
and it just stood and stared at me.

49:01.130 --> 49:01.963
I'm still trying to
figure out what the hell

49:01.963 --> 49:04.170
because now it's higher up, so my headlamp

49:04.170 --> 49:06.090
can't really focus on what it is.

49:06.090 --> 49:08.560
Brought the water in,
brought the dogs inside,

49:08.560 --> 49:10.560
by the time I went back out it was gone.

49:14.873 --> 49:15.740
- For the next few weeks

49:15.740 --> 49:18.870
repeated activity would
occur on Ricky's property,

49:18.870 --> 49:21.660
including multiple
sightings of strange shapes

49:21.660 --> 49:23.350
moving through the fields and forests

49:23.350 --> 49:24.870
surrounding his house.

49:24.870 --> 49:27.760
On more then one occasion he saw not one,

49:27.760 --> 49:30.630
but multiple pairs of strange glowing eyes

49:30.630 --> 49:32.930
peering at him from the darkness.

49:32.930 --> 49:34.950
As Ricky began to search for answers

49:34.950 --> 49:37.270
as to what was prowling on his farm

49:37.270 --> 49:39.470
he began to investigate other sightings

49:39.470 --> 49:42.610
of upright canids in the surrounding area.

49:42.610 --> 49:45.930
Soon the activity would
extend to his neighbors homes

49:45.930 --> 49:48.980
including the house
located closest to his.

49:48.980 --> 49:52.250
- So according to my neighbor,
which is my nextdoor neighbor

49:52.250 --> 49:54.930
he gets up to work at two
o'clock in the morning.

49:54.930 --> 49:57.550
He puts his trash in the
back of his pickup truck,

49:57.550 --> 49:59.510
and drives out to the front of the road,

49:59.510 --> 50:03.250
picks up his trash, goes to
the corner, puts it down.

50:03.250 --> 50:06.090
But he's hearing something from the truck,

50:06.090 --> 50:09.810
as he turns around to go
back towards his truck

50:09.810 --> 50:14.150
he sees this dog like, wolf like creature

50:14.150 --> 50:17.480
in front of his pickup
truck pacing back and forth,

50:17.480 --> 50:18.503
looking at him.

50:19.450 --> 50:23.770
He froze, it was in a kind
of crouched down position

50:23.770 --> 50:27.950
but not completely on
fours, looking at him

50:27.950 --> 50:30.040
as it paced back and forth.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.390
He got into his truck and went to work

50:32.390 --> 50:34.060
after he got his composure back

50:34.060 --> 50:35.950
because he didn't know what it was.

50:35.950 --> 50:39.423
Probably a week after,
this was mostly every week,

50:40.440 --> 50:43.290
we were outside with a
bonfire me and my neighbor,

50:43.290 --> 50:45.240
and my dad, my dad comes home

50:45.240 --> 50:46.730
from Springfield, Mass for vacation.

50:46.730 --> 50:48.320
My dad had gone inside,

50:48.320 --> 50:52.370
so it was one of those days we
decided to just call it quits

50:52.370 --> 50:54.900
because there were too many
mosquitoes and go inside.

50:54.900 --> 50:57.660
When we threw water on the fire

50:57.660 --> 51:00.330
it was looking at us from the other side

51:00.330 --> 51:02.423
of our field of our property.

51:03.650 --> 51:05.970
His eye shine was probably at my height,

51:05.970 --> 51:08.650
but you could see a silhouette,
it wasn't on all fours,

51:08.650 --> 51:12.330
it wasn't starting erectile,
it looked like it was scared.

51:12.330 --> 51:14.720
It looked terrified, it ran.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.970
While it was on the
grass it ran on two legs.

51:19.690 --> 51:23.500
When we got to the trail,
it's already overgrown,

51:23.500 --> 51:26.830
so you can't see through the
treeline, it's already June.

51:26.830 --> 51:28.400
So you know, you have
bushes and everything,

51:28.400 --> 51:30.320
you can't see, so I got kind of iffy,

51:30.320 --> 51:32.430
I told him let's head
back because if this guy

51:32.430 --> 51:34.210
is either side we don't have

51:34.210 --> 51:37.720
a lot of space between us to react.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.830
So by then I told my neighbor I think

51:39.830 --> 51:41.903
it's time for us to go inside.

51:54.910 --> 51:58.720
- Many people will tell me that they felt

51:58.720 --> 52:00.650
it was giving them a message,

52:00.650 --> 52:02.912
and the messages vary from,

52:02.912 --> 52:06.920
I could jump on your car
and get you if I wanted too,

52:06.920 --> 52:10.220
or if you tell anyone about
me I'll come and find you,

52:10.220 --> 52:13.930
or I'm better than you
are, you puny little human.

52:13.930 --> 52:15.260
That sort of thing.

52:15.260 --> 52:19.660
- I believe it's something
new to the environment.

52:19.660 --> 52:23.310
Why it sometimes preferred
when it was first seen

52:23.310 --> 52:26.070
to first scavenge instead of hunting.

52:26.070 --> 52:29.800
It has not breed to a specific look,

52:29.800 --> 52:32.320
you have so much variations to it.

52:32.320 --> 52:36.370
Paranormal no, like I said, it
eats, it drinks, it breaths.

52:36.370 --> 52:39.420
Can it do certain things that

52:39.420 --> 52:42.090
we might not think is possible?

52:42.090 --> 52:47.090
Yes, but other things that
people think that is paranormal,

52:47.410 --> 52:49.340
for me at least, I have been able

52:49.340 --> 52:52.703
to scientifically figure out.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.620
- I've always done field work,

53:40.620 --> 53:42.960
you know gone out followed tracks,

53:42.960 --> 53:44.950
looked for signs, things like that.

53:44.950 --> 53:48.040
But I had the best opportunity ever

53:48.040 --> 53:50.760
several years ago when I
was contacted by a gentleman

53:50.760 --> 53:55.760
who bought a 40 some acre hay
field, part of an old farm,

53:55.820 --> 53:58.490
that was adjacent to Bray Road.

53:58.490 --> 54:01.473
He was a retired math and
physics teacher from Illinois.

54:05.050 --> 54:07.390
- I bought the property in 2007,

54:07.390 --> 54:10.103
my farm is in between Bowers and Bray.

54:11.580 --> 54:14.820
I was new in the area so I had
not talked with many people.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.330
I cut hay, and it was ready to be bailed

54:17.330 --> 54:20.380
on a Sunday in September 2013.

54:20.380 --> 54:23.512
So I basically went down the road

54:23.512 --> 54:26.220
to a couple of local farmers, and I said

54:26.220 --> 54:28.500
I need help getting hay up,
will you guys come and help,

54:28.500 --> 54:30.090
and they said, sure we'll come and help.

54:30.090 --> 54:31.640
So they did.

54:31.640 --> 54:35.360
And after we got done, the one guys said,

54:35.360 --> 54:37.760
he said well you know
the Beast of Bray Road

54:37.760 --> 54:39.650
lives back on your property there.

54:39.650 --> 54:42.210
He said, oh yeah, he said, my wife saw it,

54:42.210 --> 54:44.370
and another farmer saw it,

54:44.370 --> 54:46.700
and then he's telling me
another farmer saw it.

54:46.700 --> 54:50.830
The one farmer who had
seen it on Bray Road,

54:50.830 --> 54:52.390
eating a raccoon.

54:52.390 --> 54:54.703
And I go okay, sure, you know, so forth.

54:56.060 --> 54:59.480
So a couple days later I
was driving down Bowers Road

54:59.480 --> 55:02.560
and there was a raccoon so I
took it and threw it outback

55:02.560 --> 55:06.530
on my property line, and
go back two days later,

55:06.530 --> 55:10.590
and here the raccoon is cut open,

55:10.590 --> 55:12.775
and the intestines are gone.

55:12.775 --> 55:15.600
- He found a raccoon that was lying there

55:15.600 --> 55:17.270
looking like something had zipped it,

55:17.270 --> 55:21.670
from under it's chin down to
the length of its abdomen,

55:21.670 --> 55:25.360
and taken the insides
out in one neat scoop,

55:25.360 --> 55:27.250
set them next to the creature.

55:27.250 --> 55:29.210
- So then I, couple days later,

55:29.210 --> 55:33.140
I got a badger, it was
dead on the road, roadkill,

55:33.140 --> 55:35.960
put it down in the hole, three days later

55:35.960 --> 55:38.680
it's out of the hole like 10-15 feet away,

55:38.680 --> 55:41.850
and a badger weighs 20-25 pounds.

55:41.850 --> 55:44.290
So I know a birds not
picking this thing up,

55:44.290 --> 55:48.150
and there's no path, the grass
is all still around this.

55:48.150 --> 55:50.130
So what I do is reach
down and take it out.

55:50.130 --> 55:55.130
I said so alright some guys
coming back on my property

55:55.550 --> 55:57.430
and doing this, that's crazy.

55:57.430 --> 55:59.393
So then I started setting up cameras.

56:00.250 --> 56:01.560
- As Lee's curiosity

56:01.560 --> 56:04.530
about the happenings on
his property began to grow,

56:04.530 --> 56:08.160
the strangeness of what he was
dealing with followed suit.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.640
Over the next four years he would document

56:10.640 --> 56:12.740
the disappearance and dismemberment

56:12.740 --> 56:15.510
of dozens of mutilated animal corpses

56:15.510 --> 56:17.493
that defied the rules of nature.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.460
While the trail cameras he set out

56:20.460 --> 56:22.500
were meant to capture evidence on whatever

56:22.500 --> 56:25.170
was behind the mutilations it soon

56:25.170 --> 56:29.070
began capturing mysterious
lights and objects in the sky,

56:29.070 --> 56:31.580
along with other unexplainable phenomenon.

56:31.580 --> 56:33.900
When Lee had a sighting
of what he believed

56:33.900 --> 56:37.350
to be a set of red eyes
belonging to the Beast itself

56:37.350 --> 56:39.450
in a field late one night,

56:39.450 --> 56:42.820
it only served to intensify
his search for answers.

56:42.820 --> 56:45.530
Before long Lee had begun
filling photo albums

56:45.530 --> 56:47.790
with evidence of unusual occurrences

56:47.790 --> 56:50.250
taking place on his farm.

56:50.250 --> 56:54.300
- I basically had a deer
out for three years,

56:54.300 --> 56:55.723
three to four years.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.460
There was things happening with the deer

56:59.460 --> 57:03.150
and the lights, they
were very close together.

57:03.150 --> 57:08.150
- He had the idea of bringing
a small deer that he found,

57:08.200 --> 57:10.440
it was a 60 pound roadkill deer.

57:10.440 --> 57:13.987
- And then a mist came
and like cloaked it,

57:13.987 --> 57:15.237
and then the deer's gone.

57:17.550 --> 57:20.600
- The deer set down in kind
of a little nest of grass

57:20.600 --> 57:24.329
on the edge of his property
and when he came back

57:24.329 --> 57:27.320
the deer was gone.

57:27.320 --> 57:29.760
He thought aha, it'll
be on the trail camera.

57:29.760 --> 57:33.170
He looked at it, and at
the time that the deer

57:33.170 --> 57:34.800
would have had to have been taken

57:34.800 --> 57:36.603
this strange mist appeared,

57:37.460 --> 57:39.790
and it was in frame
after frame after frame.

57:39.790 --> 57:42.730
In the first beginning you
can see the deer's hoofs

57:42.730 --> 57:45.375
lying there and in the last frame

57:45.375 --> 57:47.240
the deer is gone.

57:47.240 --> 57:50.130
- I said let's go look for
tracks, so we go look for tracks.

57:50.130 --> 57:52.580
There's these five toed, seven pad tracks

57:52.580 --> 57:55.850
that I have many pictures
of and castings off

57:55.850 --> 57:57.360
along the edge of the field.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.160
- And he could see that there were tracks

58:00.160 --> 58:03.230
that looked like large canine prints

58:03.230 --> 58:04.900
deeply embedded in the soil

58:04.900 --> 58:07.030
and there was only the hind set,

58:07.030 --> 58:11.010
and it had to go somehow
over a barbed wire fence

58:11.010 --> 58:12.560
and into the next field.

58:12.560 --> 58:15.780
He and a friend of his followed it

58:15.780 --> 58:18.080
all the way through that
field to where it ended up

58:18.080 --> 58:20.493
at another road and they had to stop.

58:24.410 --> 58:27.560
- I've gone to the Field Museum,

58:27.560 --> 58:29.530
they sent me to a track expert,

58:29.530 --> 58:33.424
who said these are not
tracks, these are not animals.

58:33.424 --> 58:36.430
They said, you can go to home depot

58:36.430 --> 58:38.950
and buy stilts and walk around your field

58:38.950 --> 58:40.110
and make those tracks.

58:40.110 --> 58:42.470
There's nobody walking
around my field with stilts.

58:42.470 --> 58:45.020
I tried universities,
University of Wisconsin,

58:45.020 --> 58:46.403
I tried to talk to them.

58:46.403 --> 58:51.150
I've tried VNR, they tell
me it's an abnormal coyote,

58:51.150 --> 58:52.590
and they've looked at the tracks,

58:52.590 --> 58:54.570
oh that's an abnormal coyote.

58:54.570 --> 58:57.160
- Lee's farm seems
to be uniquely positioned

58:57.160 --> 59:01.070
to reveal new information about
the mysteries of Bray Road.

59:01.070 --> 59:03.460
The data he's collected thus far implies

59:03.460 --> 59:06.380
that the wolf man or whatever it is,

59:06.380 --> 59:09.700
is only one piece in a much larger puzzle.

59:09.700 --> 59:12.900
If this impression is
true, it begs the question,

59:12.900 --> 59:15.390
why does this puzzling phenomenon

59:15.390 --> 59:20.073
appear to recur over and over
again in South East Wisconsin?

59:21.660 --> 59:24.080
The phenomenon Lee's
witnessed on his property

59:24.080 --> 59:26.880
also seems to connect some
of the stranger aspects

59:26.880 --> 59:30.460
of the modern day monster
to its ancient ancestors.

59:30.460 --> 59:33.230
Whether the dog man, if it exists,

59:33.230 --> 59:35.510
is merely a mythological figure,

59:35.510 --> 59:38.100
a misplaced, uncataloged animal,

59:38.100 --> 59:40.820
or something far beyond our understanding

59:40.820 --> 59:42.810
its presence continues to challenge

59:42.810 --> 59:46.059
those that seek answers,
causing people like Lee

59:46.059 --> 59:50.340
and Linda Godfrey to continually
seek new explanations

59:50.340 --> 59:53.240
for a mystery that might never be solved.

59:53.240 --> 59:55.650
- I believe it exists, I've seen it.

59:55.650 --> 59:58.050
I have evidence, I'm past that,

59:58.050 --> 01:00:00.080
now I want to to know
where is it coming from?

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.040
Does it really live here?

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.570
Why does it need food at all,

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.654
does it actually use it for food?

01:00:05.654 --> 01:00:07.843
That's my pursuit.

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:36.060
- While Wisconsin
is known for its dairy cows,

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.490
cheese curds and endless fields,

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:42.220
its town of Elkhorn is
known more for it's beast.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.550
Yet in the years since the first sightings

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:47.010
the town has done little
to embrace the legend

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.780
that has grown around their local monster.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.370
In the 90s at the height of
the Bray Road media frenzy,

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:56.960
t-shirts were sold, and
today you can still find

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.900
the silver bullet
special at the local bar.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.830
But aside from the
occasional curiosity seeker

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.510
asking for directions to the werewolf

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:09.100
Elkhorn is just another
small Midwestern town.

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.880
- I don't know that it's got
a commercial value to it.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.330
There's a little bit of notoriety,

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.080
but then there's still a
lot of people in the area

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.950
that have never actually heard of it.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.200
- I'm gonna say that people still want

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.350
to turn their backs on
it, for the tourism,

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:33.490
Elkhorn's not a big touristy town.

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.090
But you've got to remember the people

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.950
that are really interested in this,

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.212
it's a small portion of the population,

01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:42.440
they're not trying to
market it to the mainstream.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.870
- So it's always been a
divided reaction in the town

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.293
and I think that's to be expected.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.550
- I've had stuff sent to me from magazines

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:58.640
in the back of airline seats
about the Beast of Bray Road

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.432
from friends that are traveling.

01:02:01.432 --> 01:02:04.290
All around the country
I'll have people say,

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.910
Bray, oh like the Beast of Bray Road?

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:10.093
So it's amazing how
far the story has gone.

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:18.900
- In the beginning I
thought that the people

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.627
were seeing something, I
did not know what it was,

01:02:21.627 --> 01:02:24.420
and I still don't claim to
know for sure what it was.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.490
The newspaper was selling lots of t-shirts

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.770
and they asked me to do a
poster they could hand out

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:30.833
to people for it.

01:02:32.225 --> 01:02:35.320
I was okay with that, I
actually have a cartoon

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.690
in one of the papers that
had a cartoon drawing

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:41.130
of the werewolf being psychoanalyzed,

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.080
because all the people were driving me,

01:02:44.501 --> 01:02:46.550
you know it was just kind of a fun thing.

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.710
Somewhere in there I came to a point

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:53.110
where my curiosity blended
with the realization

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.640
that people were seeing something

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.130
that looked like an upright canine,

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:00.730
and nobody knew why,
nobody knew what it was.

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:03.650
And the sightings continued
and continued, and continued.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:08.330
I'm not sure after 26 years that I feel

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:11.870
that comfortable really joking about it

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:16.660
because I've learned that
it runs so deep worldwide

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.070
in so many channels, so many places

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:20.970
that I think there's a lot more to it

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:24.453
then appeared on the
surface back in '91, '92.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.743
And why it popped up in
Elkhorn I'll never know.

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:33.660
- In many ways
this lonely stretch of road

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.610
in Walworth County Wisconsin
is completely ordinary.

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.020
No different then the thousands of byways

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.060
which cut through the
heartland of America.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.100
And perhaps that is the
most unsettling element

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:49.800
in the flat pastureland of the Midwest,

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.990
or the haunted meadows of
Europe it can be anywhere.

01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:56.920
On quiet back roads late at night,

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.430
or in your own backyard in broad daylight.

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:02.510
Whatever this creature is

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.750
the Bray Road Beast is an intruder,

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.590
a being which forces itself into the lives

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:11.410
of those unlucky enough to see it.

01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:17.121
It could happen anywhere, at any time,

01:04:17.121 --> 01:04:19.038
it could happen to you.
