00:03.020 --> 00:05.140
Nikolai. William's brother.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.860
She's not my girlfriend,
and she's leaving now.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.840
If you really want to meet my brother,
I'll introduce you to him.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.260
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nikolai, but he's
back in Stockholm. You'll meet him before summer.]</i>

00:15.260 --> 00:16.100
They were after William,
but he wasn't there.
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nikolai, but he's
back in Stockholm. You'll meet him before summer.]</i>

00:16.100 --> 00:18.500
They were after William,
but he wasn't there.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.480
What's going on?

00:21.200 --> 00:22.180
Just stay here.

00:25.700 --> 00:26.900
It's the Yakuza guys.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.360
What's up with your phone?

01:21.720 --> 01:26.900
Yeah, sorry.
My battery is fucked.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.160
Stroll?

01:38.540 --> 01:39.960
A little stroll.

01:47.460 --> 01:48.740
Do I get a kiss?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.520
How long are we gonna stroll?

03:34.740 --> 03:39.200
Can't we just stop and argue
now? Be done with it.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.720
I don't want to argue.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.780
Yes, you do.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.740
You'll say something like:

03:51.620 --> 03:55.280
You have to stop fighting, William.
Then I'll say:

03:55.820 --> 03:59.540
I didn't mean for you to see that.
You'll say: But I did see it.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.180
I want you to stop.
Me: Fine, I'll stop.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.580
You'll say: Great.
I'll say: Good.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.400
And then we're done with it. Hm?

04:15.220 --> 04:22.800
William... You smashed a bottle
on a guy's head.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.400
In self defense? Yes.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.540
You could have killed him!

04:31.080 --> 04:33.740
Don't you understand how
serious it is?

04:35.060 --> 04:39.580
What's serious is that Yakuza
beats up innocent people.

04:42.180 --> 04:43.740
Someone had to do something.

04:44.340 --> 04:49.520
Someone didn't have to do anything!
You could've talked to him!

04:50.060 --> 04:56.800
Or contacted the police, or I don't know!
Certainly don't respond with violence.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.740
Wow you're naive.

05:02.040 --> 05:07.180
I'm naive?! Because I don't
think violence solves anything?

05:09.420 --> 05:13.540
Noora, violence solves things every day.

05:14.340 --> 05:18.460
The world is driven
by violence and war.

05:19.740 --> 05:23.120
How do you think Norway became
such a free and democratic country?

05:23.840 --> 05:27.460
They had a nice chat with
coffee and cake?

05:29.940 --> 05:33.580
No. There are people who
fought for it. With violence.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.660
How did we defend ourselves
if someone tried to take our freedom?

05:38.840 --> 05:40.720
We solved it with violence.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.540
I can't eh...

06:22.420 --> 06:24.980
I can't be together with a guy who...

06:26.400 --> 06:29.680
... who smashes bottles on
other people's heads.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.620
Don't do this, Noora.

06:44.620 --> 06:51.100
Yeah, but I need a little space.
To think through all this stuff.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.660
I can't think properly
when I'm with you.

06:58.300 --> 07:02.940
Everything just becomes messy in my head.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.060
Okay.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.480
Bit of space.

07:52.800 --> 07:59.240
Slut, slut, slut...

08:00.140 --> 08:01.900
On every picture.

08:05.060 --> 08:10.020
Who commented that?
-allah9753

08:10.940 --> 08:14.420
This weekend?
-After she posted the bus picture.

08:15.100 --> 08:19.900
Is it just because she went to the bus?
-It's not because she was being so slutty.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.320
You were acting like a real nun while
the Riot guys worked for dear life.

08:25.020 --> 08:31.580
Fucking hell, one of the Riot
guys came over to Sana and said:

08:31.820 --> 08:34.760
"Wanna join me in the back of
the bus and sit on my face?"

08:34.760 --> 08:40.800
So Sana said: "Why should I?
Is your nose bigger than your dick?"

08:41.600 --> 08:46.180
Are you kidding?
You said that? To who?

08:46.520 --> 08:51.240
I have no idea. A sexist asshole
who wouldn't take no for an answer.

08:51.460 --> 08:54.160
Vilde, you hooked up a little.

08:54.400 --> 09:00.060
The one time we're on the bus,
a random fight pops up.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.860
But it wasn't random.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.300
It was planned that
they were going to meet.

09:05.380 --> 09:10.520
Isak contacted the Penetrators after
Jonas was beat up by Yakuza.

09:11.180 --> 09:15.860
While we were out partying,
Isak called Chris.

09:16.280 --> 09:23.100
Why did it have to happen the
one time we were on the bus with them?

09:23.600 --> 09:27.380
What happened with him that
he got a wine bottle on his head?

09:27.680 --> 09:32.420
I heard someone filmed
it while it happened.

09:32.420 --> 09:37.500
If they report it,
William is screwed.

09:37.580 --> 09:41.520
It's extreme violence.
That's a prison sentence.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.860
Hey girl.
Hello.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.640
What are you doing?

10:18.900 --> 10:26.880
I'm just writing... or I'm trying to
write an article for Norwegian.

10:28.460 --> 10:32.900
But you can't concentrate on
it because you're only thinking about William?

10:43.720 --> 10:46.020
You... What's the deal?

10:50.820 --> 10:56.360
The deal is that...
I'm really in love with William.

11:02.140 --> 11:05.880
Like... insanely.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.680
Seriously in love.

11:29.260 --> 11:32.580
Don't you ever want to...

11:32.920 --> 11:39.360
...just drink until you're really drunk,
or hook up with people?

11:40.760 --> 11:41.500
Sure.

11:45.260 --> 11:49.560
What makes you not do it then?

11:59.860 --> 12:02.820
My faith is stronger than lust.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.400
It feels much more important
to me than hooking up and drinking.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.480
That's exactly it.

12:16.600 --> 12:24.460
There's nothing that feels more important
to me than to be together with William.

12:27.540 --> 12:30.700
Even though I know there should be.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.320
So why aren't you together with him?

12:40.320 --> 12:43.000
Because he's a bad person.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.500
Why is he a bad person?

12:54.900 --> 13:00.780
First off, he's very controlling.

13:04.060 --> 13:04.880
How?

13:05.820 --> 13:15.860
He tells me what I should feel,
and what to say. What I should do.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.400
And you don't dare
to contradict him?

13:21.060 --> 13:25.680
No, I do. I dare to
contradict him.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.900
But he gets angry
when you disagree with him?

13:33.120 --> 13:37.080
No, he doesn't get angry.

13:37.080 --> 13:48.780
But he argues in such a way that
I can't contradict him.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.080
So... What's the problem?
That he's smarter than you, or?

14:02.780 --> 14:05.660
He tries to change my opinion.

14:09.100 --> 14:14.240
But your opinions only change
when you think he's right.

14:16.540 --> 14:24.640
Yeah, but I'm just trying
to be strong and independent.

14:24.780 --> 14:31.180
I can't... Should I change all my
opinion for a guy, then?

14:34.720 --> 14:42.900
You are strong and independent when you can
change your opinions. No matter what gender changes you.

14:44.480 --> 14:49.820
There's nothing wrong with him
challenging the way you think.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.840
If you are not afraid
to say what you mean...

14:55.160 --> 14:58.160
... then you don't have to be
worried about him controlling you.

15:10.520 --> 15:18.880
But he's violent. He smashed
a bottle on someone's head.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.160
Yeah, okay.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.820
But why did he do it?

15:28.560 --> 15:40.840
Because he has these damn ideas that
the world is driven by war and violence.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.760
We are completely different.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.300
I am against war.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.100
That's not why
he smashed the bottle.

15:58.200 --> 16:04.180
He smashed the bottle because he
was angry and scared. Why was that?

16:08.700 --> 16:09.900
I don't know.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.300
You didn't ask him?

16:17.080 --> 16:18.540
No...

16:28.340 --> 16:33.060
Okay. I think it's interesting that
you're saying you're against war.

16:34.360 --> 16:39.540
War doesn't start with violence.
It starts with misunderstandings and prejudice.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.760
Yeah, so what?

16:42.780 --> 16:45.260
If you say you're
in favor of a world full of peace...

16:47.520 --> 16:54.420
... you have to try to understand why
others think and act the way they do.

16:58.560 --> 17:03.380
You have to accept that not everyone
sees the world the way you do.

17:06.600 --> 17:14.300
You can't just believe that everyone has
the answers to what is right and wrong.

17:18.680 --> 17:25.340
If you haven't even made an attempt
to understand the one you love...

17:27.120 --> 17:30.480
... then I'll be pessimistic
on behalf of the whole world.

17:36.160 --> 17:44.000
You don't have to be with him, but you can't decide
it without even trying to understand him.

18:10.940 --> 18:12.880
Then there's Vilde...

18:14.440 --> 18:16.680
Ah, Vilde.

18:22.360 --> 18:28.840
I'm really scared that
she'll be devastated.

18:31.800 --> 18:37.220
You're underestimating Vilde. She's
the coolest of us all.

18:38.060 --> 18:41.280
She's actually the first one
I would take to war with me.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.400
Just tell her. She'll manage.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.660
And she knows.
That William isn't hers.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.040
Deep down.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.740
Deep down, indeed.

18:59.640 --> 19:08.920
Deep, deep, really deep down.
In the inner cells of her body, there's an atom.

19:09.540 --> 19:13.060
In that atom, there is a proton.

19:13.580 --> 19:17.020
In that proton, there's a small sealed box.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.120
Inside that sealed box, there's another box.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.980
And inside that box, that's where she knows.

19:27.380 --> 19:28.140
Good luck.

19:36.820 --> 19:38.620
But completely serious now, Noora...

19:40.460 --> 19:44.220
If nothing feels more important to
you than being with William...

19:46.060 --> 19:49.060
You have to try to make it work.

19:51.420 --> 19:55.320
It's not certain it'll go well.
It may as well go to hell.

19:56.740 --> 19:57.980
But that's life!

20:00.760 --> 20:02.980
It's impossible to know for sure.

20:06.780 --> 20:10.300
Unless you have a magic
hijab like me. Then you know.

20:13.320 --> 20:19.260
What does your magic hijab
say about me and William?

20:19.260 --> 20:21.260
It says inshallah.

20:25.340 --> 20:29.340
What does it mean?
Is it good or bad?

20:30.660 --> 20:33.740
Impossible to say.
Could go either way.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.080
Okay.

20:39.260 --> 20:45.120
Who would have thought?
Sana has a soft side.

20:49.060 --> 20:51.140
If you fucking tell someone...

21:27.600 --> 21:28.840
Hey Vilde.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.720
Noora? Hi.

21:33.540 --> 21:34.740
What are you doing here?

21:41.040 --> 21:43.340
I have to talk to you.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.780
Coffee?

22:01.480 --> 22:02.560
Thanks.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.620
I'm in love with William.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.100
And he's in love with you?

22:47.520 --> 22:48.420
I think so.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.480
What are you thinking?

23:19.060 --> 23:20.620
A bit relieved, maybe?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.160
Oh?

23:34.120 --> 23:37.620
I thought about why I was
so obsessed with William.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.820
I knew he was just a fuckboy.

23:44.620 --> 23:47.640
I thought I could use him
to just be done with the first time.

23:50.260 --> 23:53.540
But then when we were together,
he wasn't a fuckboy.

23:53.540 --> 23:57.980
He was good, nice, and kind.

24:00.340 --> 24:01.900
That meant something.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.600
It got me thinking that maybe
it meant something for him as well.

24:20.780 --> 24:23.040
Of course I understand that it didn't...

24:24.780 --> 24:27.760
.. .when he said I wasn't good enough.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.680
That's when I was done with him.

24:36.120 --> 24:44.180
It only confirmed that he
never felt something for me.

24:48.320 --> 24:55.280
But then he apologised, and there he was again.
He sent messages and invited us to parties.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.460
That's when I was unsure.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.900
I think it was the uncertainty
that just made me completely...

25:09.300 --> 25:10.540
Crazy.

25:30.460 --> 25:31.700
But now...

25:34.320 --> 25:36.620
Now that you say you're in love...

25:41.500 --> 25:45.160
I don't have to
wonder what he's feeling.

25:50.320 --> 25:54.360
And that's a relief.
If you get what I mean.

26:17.360 --> 26:21.000
Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

26:23.200 --> 26:31.060
All those times you said William was a
selfish asshole that wasn't good enough for me.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.080
Do you think he's good enough for you?

26:44.880 --> 26:45.920
I don't know.

26:56.660 --> 26:59.620
Anyway, I'm really glad
that you told me.

27:01.260 --> 27:02.060
Thanks.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.780
No, of course...

27:10.400 --> 27:12.560
It's not "of course".

27:13.160 --> 27:16.820
You could have tried to kept it a secret.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.360
Pretended there was nothing. Dragged
it out, let me sit there and talk about William...

27:22.360 --> 27:25.680
... and look stupid. While you actually
knew he had feelings for you.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.680
But I did keep
it a secret from you.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.180
I know that.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.100
I was just testing you.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.960
You knew?

28:11.780 --> 28:14.860
Yeah. I've known it for a while.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.260
But I'm gonna continue
working out.

28:20.540 --> 28:25.840
Do you think this body becomes
like this by itself? Huh? No!

28:26.080 --> 28:31.820
It's hard work. This here are squats,
every two days. Every morning at 7.

28:37.920 --> 28:43.300
I'll be done in half an hour. Do you
want to eat lunch at the coffee place?

29:37.240 --> 29:38.060
Hi.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.600
Noora, wasn't it?

29:42.840 --> 29:45.460
Eh, yeah.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.180
Hi.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.900
Is William at home?

29:52.220 --> 29:53.120
Sorry.

29:56.360 --> 30:00.080
Okay. But do you know where he is?

30:01.480 --> 30:04.060
Yeah, where is he?
Training, maybe?

30:07.980 --> 30:14.100
Did you try to call him?
-Yeah, but my phone runs out of power all the time.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.620
I can try to call him for you.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.760
Eh, yeah.

30:24.700 --> 30:28.060
Or do you have a charger?
A phone charger?

30:28.800 --> 30:30.360
Yeah, yeah!

30:41.020 --> 30:44.460
This is Noora. She'll just
borrow a phone charger.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.380
Do you want some wine?
-No thanks.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.940
Something else to drink?

31:01.540 --> 31:02.860
I'm fine.

31:15.740 --> 31:19.400
I actually thought
you were in Stockholm?

31:21.860 --> 31:24.760
Okay... Why?

31:31.940 --> 31:33.820
Because William said so?

31:36.640 --> 31:38.020
William, William..

31:43.380 --> 31:46.840
William isn't very fond
of mixing friends and family, you see.

32:44.140 --> 32:45.440
He's not answering?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.220
Eh, no.

32:57.800 --> 33:02.080
We're in a fight, so...

33:08.600 --> 33:12.820
I can send him a message to find out
when he's coming home, if you want me to?

33:19.840 --> 33:24.160
Eh, yeah. Maybe.
If you want to.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.780
Who's the girl with blonde
hair sitting at the end?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.180
Eh, Mari.

33:48.540 --> 33:51.420
I think she goes to my school.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.200
Yeah, she goes to Nissen.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.700
Did you get a reply?

34:21.740 --> 34:23.540
William's not coming home...

34:25.780 --> 34:26.580
... tonight.

34:41.820 --> 34:43.620
Where is he, then?

34:52.440 --> 34:57.320
Noora, you...
seem like an incredibly nice girl.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.700
And I'm really happy for William.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.520
He's my little brother.

35:05.640 --> 35:09.180
There's nothing I want more than
for him to have a girl like you.

35:11.820 --> 35:16.460
It's just that William
is... complicated.

35:29.660 --> 35:30.660
Complicated?

35:37.580 --> 35:40.900
He used to have
these insane tantrums.

35:42.960 --> 35:48.740
He would hit, or bite. Kick.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.940
He once threatened to push
our little sister out the window.

35:56.840 --> 36:02.140
Mom sometimes had to lock him inside of a room.
She was so scared of what he could do.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.660
He's stopped biting, though

36:20.320 --> 36:23.020
William has always
done as he pleases.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.680
He's good at manipulating people
to get what he wants.

36:30.040 --> 36:35.600
When he doesn't get what he wants,
he becomes extremely destructive.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.740
He doesn't really
care about other people.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.660
If you were wondering why he didn't
want us to meet. This is why.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.540
He's really scared
of being found out.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.260
Perhaps I'm a bad brother
for telling you this but..

37:03.920 --> 37:07.660
I've seen enough good
women like you come and go.

37:09.780 --> 37:15.800
There are girls who believe he's good deep down.
That he's going to be better to them.

37:19.940 --> 37:21.180
I don't know...

37:23.480 --> 37:27.280
You're standing here. Waiting.

37:30.780 --> 37:35.060
While he's out there somewhere
and sleeping with someone else.
