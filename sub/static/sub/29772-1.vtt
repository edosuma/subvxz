shy these days.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.788

is more my thing.

fine, it's super fun.

And if you mess up,
I'll just edit it out.

Well, I don't work
here specifically.

in digital marketing

09:45.323 --> 09:46.542
and social media PR.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.241
But I dabble in helping coffee
shops like this, you know,

09:50.285 --> 09:53.288

um, and by the way,

09:53.331 --> 09:55.333
they have the best
house-made lavender syrup,

and come right down.

Coffee on Instagram.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.691
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

guess you could say,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.129

do with my degree

was to be that go-to person

10:10.000 --> 10:11.872

to explode online

10:11.915 --> 10:14.222
and help people become
more vlog worthy,

10:14.265 --> 10:15.223
I guess you could say.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.833
- Really?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.661
- You're really comfortable
in front of a camera.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.620
It's brave of you to let people

10:20.663 --> 10:21.925
into your life like
that, you know?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.057
It takes a certain type.

10:23.100 --> 10:23.884
- I enjoy it.

10:23.927 --> 10:24.667
I really do.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.105
- I could help you, you know?

10:28.149 --> 10:31.152
If that's what you wanted,
but you don't really need it.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.762
- Um, yeah, I think I'm okay.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.242
I'm up to 10,000 followers.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.547

Well, if you're thinking
of getting serious

10:39.639 --> 10:41.292
and growing your
brand, don't be shy.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.381
You'd be surprised how much work

10:43.425 --> 10:46.907

generating their followings.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.609
I hope we talk soon.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.496
- Oh, thank you.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.498
My grandma left
it to my parents.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.893
They'll never leave
Wisconsin, so here I am.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.723
- That's a whole lot of cameras.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.290

11:22.333 --> 11:24.031
I hate watching stiff vloggers.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.816
- Thank you so much
for doing this.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.122
- [Mel] My pleasure.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.863
So much easier to get
some fame nowadays,

11:29.906 --> 11:31.865
why not go out and grab it?

11:31.908 --> 11:33.344
- I can think of a few reasons.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.173
- [Mel] I'm starting
to get the sense

11:36.217 --> 11:37.261
that you're not into this.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.874
- I'm a big fan of
the girl in question,

11:42.310 --> 11:45.400
but this, no, not this.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.577
- Well, she's a big
fan of you, babe.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.057
I appreciate you doing this.

11:50.971 --> 11:51.798
- [Mel] It'll be painless.

11:51.841 --> 11:52.973
I promise.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.671
Audiences love couple stuff,

11:55.715 --> 11:58.805
even that goofy one you
posted the other day...

11:58.848 --> 12:00.415
How about some wine?

12:00.458 --> 12:04.593
- Um, so I don't
really drink anymore.

12:04.636 --> 12:08.075
It's kind of a long story.
- House is dry.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.164
- [Mel] No worries.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.469
And no wine is fine.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.169
- Mel, you sure
you never took any

12:15.212 --> 12:17.606
of the Stage 32
writers' workshops?

12:17.649 --> 12:19.477
- [Mel] I swear, I really
don't think we've met.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.001
I'd remember.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.743
- I guess, but you
just look so familiar.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.483
- [Mel] All righty,
you guys, ready?

12:28.443 --> 12:29.531
- This is nice.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.619
Just us.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.491
I mean, the cameras.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.058
- I just want my fans to see me,

12:35.102 --> 12:38.105
or, well, us, and
how happy I am.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.977
There's more to life
than just necklaces,

12:41.021 --> 12:42.500
bracelets, and earrings.

12:43.545 --> 12:44.459
- That is true.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.593
This is real corny.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.247
- Dave, please.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.161
- Sorry.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.554
- [Mel] It's okay.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.686
Just go from there and I'll
piece it together after.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.778
- I don't really
wanna ask these.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.695
- Please?

13:03.739 --> 13:06.437
Please, please, please, please?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.669
- How many people
have you slept with?

13:21.496 --> 13:22.410
- Um.

13:24.064 --> 13:29.025
Like, nine, I guess.

13:30.592 --> 13:33.290
I don't know, it's all an
insignificant blur before you.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.683
Wait, what about you?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.554
- Oh, it's all just
an insignificant blur,

13:37.599 --> 13:40.428
but it's a lot less than nine!

13:40.471 --> 13:41.211
I know that!

13:43.823 --> 13:46.434
Des, this is making me
look like a complete creep.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.827
- Mel, he doesn't wanna do it.

13:47.870 --> 13:48.871
- [Mel] So lame.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.835
- Another fun way to
wear a colored stone

13:55.878 --> 13:59.926
is layering delicate necklaces
with coordinated stones.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.579
You can do it every time
you're wearing a neutral top

14:01.623 --> 14:03.973
for that extra pop of color.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.888
I do it every time I
wear black or white--

14:05.932 --> 14:07.542
- [Dave] Okay, Des.

14:07.585 --> 14:08.499
- Because we all need a
little color in our lives.

14:08.543 --> 14:09.631
- [Dave] Ready to go?

14:09.674 --> 14:10.501
- I'm doing it right now.

14:10.545 --> 14:11.372
See?

14:12.721 --> 14:14.897
Perfect for my dinner
date at Catch tonight.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.641
- I believe it's
pronounced Cache.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.170
Babe?

14:27.214 --> 14:28.693
- Yes?

14:28.737 --> 14:32.567
- We have a reservation
in eight minutes.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.612
It's gonna take us
15 to get there.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.875
Can we please go?

14:37.180 --> 14:38.529
- Just, I'm almost done, okay?

14:38.573 --> 14:39.748
Two minutes. I promise.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.576
- I don't want to lose
another reservation.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.186
- [Des] That was one time!

14:43.230 --> 14:44.796
- And what are you
telling these people

14:44.840 --> 14:45.754
where we're going for?

14:45.797 --> 14:47.060
That freaks me out.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.760
[Des sighs]

14:51.803 --> 14:53.283
I thought you were
gonna toss this.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.723
- Mel really knows her stuff

14:58.767 --> 15:02.597
and she can really help me
grow my brand, so, yeah.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.077
- [Dave] Grow your brand.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.687
- What?!

15:07.341 --> 15:10.953
- This isn't just another fun
way to promote your jewelry?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.869
[static crackling]

15:16.567 --> 15:19.266
I'll call Catch, tell them
we're going to be late.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.181
Hurry.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.620
[sighs]

15:26.969 --> 15:28.666
- Another fun new way
to wear a colored stone

15:28.710 --> 15:30.277
is by wearing them
on your fingers.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.104
See?

15:41.070 --> 15:43.594
[Dave sighs]

15:44.595 --> 15:46.467
- Promise we're done after this?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.295
- Mel, he doesn't want to do it.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.644
How much longer?

15:49.687 --> 15:50.906
- [Mel] Yeah, you guys
are almost done, okay?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.647
People are loving
you, by the way.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.475
You're up to 20,000.

15:54.518 --> 15:58.000
- Yeah, well, we did
get some weird comments.

15:58.044 --> 16:02.048
Some people wrote in that they
wanted to see Des kiss a girl

16:02.091 --> 16:04.572
or scissor a girl.
[Des chuckles]

16:04.615 --> 16:06.052
That's not funny, that's weird.

16:06.878 --> 16:07.836
- Babe.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.359
People are weird.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.579
Don't worry about
random comments.

16:11.622 --> 16:15.670
- What about "I would tap
that ass to be number 10?"

16:15.713 --> 16:16.497
Or wait for it,

16:18.847 --> 16:21.328
box of sand that was
delivered to her house

16:21.371 --> 16:23.460
because she loves the beach.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.723
It's weird people
knows where she lives.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.508
It's definitely not safe.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
- [Mel] I think Dave
is a little jealous.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.728
- Dave, come on.
- Get outta here.

16:30.772 --> 16:31.947
That's ridiculous.
- Come on.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.862
These comments are
coming from people

16:33.905 --> 16:36.343
that are hiding behind
their computer screens.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.258
Stay positive, stay fun.

16:38.301 --> 16:38.998
- [Des] Dave.

16:39.041 --> 16:39.824
For me?

16:39.868 --> 16:40.695
- Okay.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.044
Fine.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.611
Let's just get back to
shooting a jewelry vlog

16:43.654 --> 16:47.528
because that's what we
were doing, a jewelry vlog.

16:47.571 --> 16:52.011
- What if, after this, Dave
goes on a little vlog-cation?

16:52.054 --> 16:53.403
Me and Des will
get enough footage

16:53.447 --> 16:54.883
to last for a little while.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.624
You come back, nail
the couple vlog,

16:56.667 --> 16:59.148
and take a little break.

16:59.192 --> 17:02.586
I mean, it's an idea, but
it's not up to me, so...

17:03.457 --> 17:04.806
- That could work.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.460
Not too long though.

17:06.502 --> 17:09.289
- [Mel] No, just give
Dave the break he wants.

17:10.811 --> 17:13.075
- [Des] You can take some
time to work on that mon-com.

17:13.118 --> 17:16.731
- I guess, if that
means we can spend time

17:16.773 --> 17:18.602
without that damn
phone in our face.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.953
How long you think it will take?

17:21.997 --> 17:22.824
- [Mel] Three to four days.

17:22.867 --> 17:23.912
Tops.

17:25.782 --> 17:26.696
- Yoga time it is, then.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.002
Let's do this.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.439
- [Des] I love you,
you're the best.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.746
[Dave sighs]

17:34.923 --> 17:36.925
[sighs]

17:38.318 --> 17:40.668
- [Mel] Oh, don't
tell me you're shy.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.845
Let's see how camera
shy you really are.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.672
Ready?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.501
See?

17:47.544 --> 17:48.763
Told you, you'd love it.

17:49.938 --> 17:50.895
- Hi, guys!

17:50.939 --> 17:52.984
Check out my office today.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.290
I know that I'm always working,

17:54.334 --> 17:56.205
but one of the perks
about being in LA

17:56.249 --> 17:58.729
is that when I'm not
working on my jewelry,

17:58.773 --> 18:01.080
I'm only a few hundred
feet away from this.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.084
I wish I can send some
rays to the east coast

18:05.127 --> 18:08.826
to help melt that nasty
Nor'easter they're having.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.830
[static crackling]

18:16.878 --> 18:18.706
Also, turquoise colored stones

18:18.749 --> 18:21.056
are a great compliment
to any bathing suit.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.797
Just make sure to not stay
out in the sun too long

18:22.840 --> 18:24.712
or they will start to turn.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.061
- [Mel] That was great, Des.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.584
Girls are gonna wish
they were by the pool,

18:27.628 --> 18:28.803
and guys are gonna love it.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.631
You look so hot.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.676
[yelps]

18:38.987 --> 18:42.077
[static crackles]

18:42.121 --> 18:44.732
[Mel humming]

18:48.388 --> 18:49.954
- I don't know
about this one, Mel.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.957
I think Dave's gonna be pissed.

18:53.001 --> 18:53.871
- [Mel] Oh, come on.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.221
It's making people like you,

18:55.264 --> 18:58.659
and then they'll like
your jewelry even more.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.182
People like to feel included.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.838
Look, if it feels weird,

19:03.881 --> 19:06.667
just say so, we can stop and
no one ever has to see it.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.887
Pick up from where we left off?

19:09.931 --> 19:10.975
- Deal.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.333
Hi, guys!

19:20.376 --> 19:22.639
So I just showed you
some new design ideas

19:22.683 --> 19:24.424
for a sexy new pair of earrings.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.816
And I need your
help, by the way.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.949
Let me know which
one you liked better.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.777
But I also need your help

19:29.820 --> 19:32.823
with picking out a new
bra to entice Dave with.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.390
There are two contenders.

19:39.047 --> 19:39.830
This one

19:40.918 --> 19:41.963
or

19:46.185 --> 19:47.316
this one.

19:48.535 --> 19:49.971
He's special to me,

19:50.014 --> 19:51.190
so I wanna wear something
special for him.

19:53.714 --> 19:54.454
How was that?

19:54.497 --> 19:55.411
- [Mel] It was great.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.936
- So which one do
you like better, huh?

19:58.980 --> 19:59.894
Like this one?

19:59.937 --> 20:01.287
This one, this, this, this one?

20:01.330 --> 20:02.810
Uh, uh, uh!

20:02.853 --> 20:04.203
Or you like this bra?

20:04.246 --> 20:05.378
Like this bra?

20:05.421 --> 20:06.509
[Mel chuckles]
Or you like this bra?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.207
This bra or this bra?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.382
This bra? Uh!

20:09.425 --> 20:10.600
- [Mel] That's perfect, Des.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.993
[Mel chuckles]

20:12.036 --> 20:13.690
Get those likes.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.126
So sexy.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.216
I knew you would do
whatever it takes.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.783
Glad I wasn't wrong about you.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.003
You're gonna be a star.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.364
[laptop ringing]

20:41.936 --> 20:43.633
- Dezzy!
- Hi!

20:43.677 --> 20:45.069
Oh my, God.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.071
I missed your beautiful face.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.334
- Oh, I missed you too.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.944
- Are you back in town, or what?

20:49.987 --> 20:52.207
- No, I'm still gonna be
on tour for a couple weeks,

20:52.251 --> 20:54.253
but I had some time,
so I was, like,

20:54.296 --> 20:56.255
I wanna know how
my favorite actress

20:56.298 --> 20:57.908
slash jewelry designer is.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.084
- Did you see I'm up
to 11,000 subscribers?

21:00.128 --> 21:01.042
Crazy?

21:01.085 --> 21:02.086
- It is. I did.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.523
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.915
I really am so proud.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.091
But about the vlog, I
just wanna know, like,

21:07.135 --> 21:08.919
is that what you want?

21:08.963 --> 21:11.618
I mean, you gotta be so careful

21:11.661 --> 21:13.533
that you don't put
yourself in a position

21:13.576 --> 21:15.056
that you can't get out of.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.537
I mean, I've been
there, trust me, I know.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.801
And you're a lot
better than numbers.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.282
So, I don't mean to
be too much or pushy,

21:23.325 --> 21:25.806
but just be careful.

21:25.849 --> 21:29.026
- I get it, I do, but I'm fine.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.289
- Hold on, hold on.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.812
Sorry, I gotta take this call.

21:31.855 --> 21:32.856
I'm so sorry.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.118
- Okay.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.468
Bye!

21:35.511 --> 21:36.469
- Bye, love!

21:43.171 --> 21:44.738
- Guess who?

21:44.781 --> 21:46.217
I couldn't sleep last
night 'cause I was up

21:46.261 --> 21:48.176
thinking about all the cool
new bracelets and necklaces

21:48.219 --> 21:51.005
I'm gonna design
for you guys, like--

21:51.048 --> 21:53.094
[knocking]

21:53.137 --> 21:54.182
Oh, she's here.

21:54.225 --> 21:54.965
BRB.

22:05.062 --> 22:05.976
Ready to vlog?

22:06.020 --> 22:06.934
- [Mel] Oh, no, no, no, no.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.544
You're the star, not me.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.025
- I just finished a
little jewelry spiel.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.027
- [Mel] Oh, yeah, oh, I
was telling my friends

22:13.070 --> 22:15.029
to check out your stuff.
- Oh, my God, thank you!

22:15.072 --> 22:16.247
Thank you so much!

22:16.291 --> 22:17.292
Okay, I'm gonna go call, Dave.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.162
- [Mel] Okay.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.294
I'll set up.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.643
Tell him I said hi.
- Will do!

22:23.385 --> 22:24.691
Hey, babe.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.171
How's it going with the script?

22:28.869 --> 22:32.133
[Mel humming]
Oh, yeah?

22:37.225 --> 22:38.269
[static crackles]

22:38.313 --> 22:40.924
[Mel humming]

22:45.799 --> 22:46.582
- Shh.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.590
Ready whenever you are.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.209
- I feel like this
is a little much.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.125
- [Mel] I thought you
were up for anything.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.126
We're doing this.

23:10.954 --> 23:15.655
- I know, but the other stuff
was a little more playful

23:15.698 --> 23:17.831
and still dealt with my jewelry.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.528
- But people will eat it up.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.664
- Yeah, I'm not piercing myself.

23:24.707 --> 23:25.578
Sorry.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.580
- It's just a belly button.

23:27.623 --> 23:30.104
Do it for a new belly
button stone or something.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.802
[sighs]

23:32.846 --> 23:34.413
- Mel, I'm really sorry,

23:34.456 --> 23:37.241
but this one's a
little bit too much.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.547
Plus, nobody does this anymore.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.201
It's so '90s.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.554
Can we just skip it?

23:45.598 --> 23:47.208
[Mel chuckles]

23:47.251 --> 23:48.296
- [Mel] No.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.865
- [Des] I mean, people
loved your other stuff,

23:51.908 --> 23:53.562
like the making tiny
jewelry for your hamster.

23:53.606 --> 23:54.911
That was super cute.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.174
- You have to escalate
to be vlog worthy.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.702
- [Des] Um, not like this.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.268
I'm out.
- Sit down.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.142
- What?
- Sit down.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.273
Please.
- Mel.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.275
What's wrong?

24:12.712 --> 24:14.322
- We're gonna pierce your
belly button, that's what.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.324
- [Des] I already
said I didn't want to.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.893
- I'm just messing with you.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.156
Relax.
[both chuckle]

24:22.199 --> 24:24.201
I'm totally messing.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.465
[Mel groans]
- Are you freaking insane?!

24:26.508 --> 24:27.770
- [Mel] I'm not the one
who wanted thousands

24:27.814 --> 24:29.293
to see my personal life!

24:29.337 --> 24:34.298
[static crackling]
[Des groans]

24:35.038 --> 24:36.910
[Mel groans]

24:36.953 --> 24:38.302
- [Des] Help!

24:38.346 --> 24:41.262
[door thuds]

24:41.305 --> 24:43.830
- [Mel] Don't scream.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.222
Now we get serious.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.364
- No, no, no!

24:56.407 --> 24:58.975
[Des screams]
- Stop screaming, Des.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.063
It's not becoming.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.239
Your fans won't like it.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.242
'Cause if you
really wanna scream,

25:05.286 --> 25:07.157
I can give you a reason, okay?

25:13.468 --> 25:15.383
- Please don't kill me.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.210
Please, I'll do
anything you want,

25:16.253 --> 25:17.428
just don't hurt me or Goblin.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.039
- That's the spirit.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.564
- Why are you doing this, Mel?

25:22.608 --> 25:23.347
Please.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.435
Why?

25:24.479 --> 25:26.220
What do you want? I'll do it.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.700
Just please let me go.
- I just want you

25:27.743 --> 25:28.962
to be vlog worthy.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.488
And it's fun for you.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.011
You get to act again.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.407
I found these lying around.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.409
Hm.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.979
Resume on the back is
pretty scarce though.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.242
Kinda embarrassing, huh?

25:53.464 --> 25:55.292
That's why it's a
dry house, isn't it?

25:56.729 --> 25:58.121
Mm.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.515
I know, Des, failure's hard.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.866
- Stop it!
- Redemption is fun though.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.217
And you can act again for me.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.960
Remember, stay
positive, stay fun.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.789
- What are you talking about?

26:13.833 --> 26:16.096
- We're gonna pierce
your belly button

26:16.139 --> 26:18.315
and you're gonna act
like you like it.

26:18.359 --> 26:19.360
- No, no, no.

26:19.403 --> 26:20.317
With that?

26:20.361 --> 26:21.318
No.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.145
Oh, my God.

26:22.189 --> 26:22.972
No, no, no, no.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.365
You're insane!

26:24.408 --> 26:25.758
- [Mel] Me?

26:25.801 --> 26:28.238
It was your idea.
[Des yelps]

26:28.282 --> 26:31.285
[Des whimpering]

26:31.328 --> 26:32.373
Oh.

26:46.256 --> 26:49.259
[Mel humming]

26:49.303 --> 26:53.350
Vloggers come and go
and no one gives a crap.

26:53.394 --> 26:57.050
I'm here to build you
up and make you famous.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.181
You asked me here.

26:59.182 --> 27:00.967
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

27:01.010 --> 27:02.446
It's always what you wanted.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.015
You will do this
and you'll like it.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.409
Here, and don't try
anything stupid.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.636
What are you waiting for?

27:18.680 --> 27:19.594
Focus, Des.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.510
I'd give you something
to sterilize it with,

27:22.553 --> 27:25.295
but there's no alcohol, so--
- [Des] I can't, I can't.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.470
- [Mel] Just like we practiced.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.647
Hold and pinch, okay?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.300
- Yeah. Okay, okay.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.258
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.564
- [Mel] And action!

27:34.478 --> 27:36.002
- Hey, guys!

27:36.045 --> 27:37.307
Des here.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.265
You know I love jewelry.

27:38.308 --> 27:39.440
I can't get enough--

27:39.483 --> 27:40.571
- [Mel] Happier, Des!

27:40.615 --> 27:41.572
Smile!

27:47.970 --> 27:48.841
- Hey, guys!

27:48.884 --> 27:50.016
Des here.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.278
You know I love jewelry.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.367
I can't get enough of it.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.719
And today, I'm adding some
more, a belly button ring.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.939
People think it's old
school, but I like it.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.159
I'm gonna, I'm
gonna attempt to--

28:03.203 --> 28:03.986
- [Mel] Cut.

28:05.161 --> 28:08.251
Happier and no attempt.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.165
Go from there.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.822
- I'm gonna pierce
my belly button.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.391
Who says an awl is just
good for jewelry-making?

28:19.349 --> 28:21.308
- [Mel] Don't get
any ideas, honey,

28:22.831 --> 28:26.052
or else that awl will be
through your skinny little neck.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.230
Now, continue from there.

28:33.799 --> 28:34.582
- Okay.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.366
Here I go.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.411
- [Mel] Wipe the tears.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.455
No tears.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.282
Say you're excited.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.591
[Des whimpering]

28:54.254 --> 28:55.429
- Here I go.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.430
I'm excited.

29:04.351 --> 29:07.006
[Des whimpering]

29:14.274 --> 29:16.145
- [Mel] Do it now, or
I'll do it for you.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.844
[Des whimpering]

29:30.333 --> 29:32.509
[screaming]

29:38.167 --> 29:39.603
Good girl!

29:39.647 --> 29:40.517
You did it!

29:40.561 --> 29:42.171
And that's it!

29:42.215 --> 29:45.871
That's just a taste of danger,
and they'll love you for it.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.177
Oh, Des, come on.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.439
Tell everyone how
much fun it was.

29:51.180 --> 29:51.964
Say it.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.236
- That was fun.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.247
- [Mel] Clean yourself up.

30:24.605 --> 30:25.649
Thanks for coming.

30:25.693 --> 30:26.476
- Of course.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.001
Good footage?

30:29.044 --> 30:30.480
- [Mel] Great footage.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.004
[Josh chuckles]

30:32.047 --> 30:33.744
- [Josh] The pineapple
router is set.

30:33.788 --> 30:37.226
I just gotta connect
these bad boys,

30:38.706 --> 30:42.797
and then I'll have access
to all the footage to edit.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.321
Hey, gimme her phone.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.367
I'll connect you to the cloud.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.717
- [Mel] You're a
freaking genius.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.501
- [Josh] I just try
and do what I can.

30:51.545 --> 30:52.720
- For me, right?

30:52.763 --> 30:54.591
- [Josh] Yeah, for you.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.593
- [Des] A pineapple router?

30:56.637 --> 30:57.290
What's that?

30:58.682 --> 31:01.207
- It gives me wireless
access to your entire world.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.645
You've been hacked, hot stuff.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.125
- When you edit this,

31:06.168 --> 31:07.691
needs to look like she's
having a good time.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.650
- [Josh] Oh, yeah, I got it.

31:10.694 --> 31:11.826
- [Mel] Good.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.355
- Hey, guys. It's me, Des.
You know I love jewelry.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.879
Can't get enough of it.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.969
So, today, I'm going to add
some more, a belly button ring.

31:25.274 --> 31:28.277
I know it's a little old
school, but I like it.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.583
Here I go!

31:29.626 --> 31:30.584
I'm excited!

31:32.542 --> 31:35.284
[Mel laughing]

31:36.720 --> 31:38.418
- [Mel] You know what?

31:38.461 --> 31:39.941
You're such a
great actress, Des.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.727
I mean, I'm surprised
you had to give it up.

31:43.771 --> 31:44.772
- That was fun.

31:46.861 --> 31:49.037
- If I didn't know
you any better,

31:49.081 --> 31:50.778
I'd think that you
really love this.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.694
And look at all these comments.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.828
These people are loving you.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.614
I mean, all these likes
and comments and shares.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.007
I mean, it's fantastic!

32:03.269 --> 32:05.749
I think your fans
are ready for more.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.795
The milk challenge,
have you heard of it?

32:10.015 --> 32:12.626
Hey, I'm talking to you.

32:12.669 --> 32:13.975
- The milk challenge,

32:14.019 --> 32:15.803
yeah, you drink a
lot of milk quickly

32:15.846 --> 32:17.109
and then you throw it up.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.984
- I floated the
idea by your fans.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.073
Let's see what they think.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.553
The milk challenge is lame?

32:28.816 --> 32:30.600
Sasha234, you think so too, huh?

32:31.993 --> 32:33.429
Your fans don't know, Des.

32:40.262 --> 32:43.178
I mean, we can't be lame, right?

32:43.222 --> 32:44.179
We can't be lame.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.270
We can't be lame,
can we, Des, huh?!

32:49.576 --> 32:52.013
We can't be lame, can we?!

32:52.057 --> 32:55.103
[Mel whimpering]

32:55.147 --> 32:57.888
[Mel grunts]

32:57.932 --> 33:00.761
[Mel whimpering]

33:04.460 --> 33:05.984
- [Des] Mel, no.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.595
I thought we were finished.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.336
- You'll be fine.

33:10.379 --> 33:12.729
I got this specifically for you.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.733
- Mel, please.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.257
Please.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.520
- Everyone falls off
the wagon occasionally.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.304
And this won't be lame.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.741
Everybody loves a drunk girl.

33:26.656 --> 33:27.701
- No more.

33:28.528 --> 33:29.311
Please.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.361
- [Mel] Okay.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.276
- What are you doing? What is
that, no, no, no, no, no, no,

33:37.319 --> 33:39.930
no, no, no, no, no, no.
- This is for your own good.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.932
We have to make sure
that you cooperate.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.152
- No, please.

33:46.372 --> 33:51.333
- Go on.
[Des panting]

34:09.003 --> 34:10.222
Like a pro.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.471
- Hey, guys.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.820
It's me.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.213
Shot time.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.911
It's three, two, one, let's go!

34:51.219 --> 34:52.002
- [Mel] Smile.

34:54.962 --> 34:55.745
Brilliant.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.532
There you go.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.882
[Des gurgles]

35:02.970 --> 35:05.581
[Des heaving]

35:08.280 --> 35:10.760
Come on, come on, let it out!

36:16.696 --> 36:19.568
[static crackling]

36:24.921 --> 36:26.923
- He's a selfish asshole.

36:26.967 --> 36:30.231
All he cares about
is his stupid movies.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.451
I'm more talented
than he'll ever be!

36:34.061 --> 36:35.280
I fucking hate Dave!

36:36.672 --> 36:37.456
I hate him.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.809
[Des gurgling]

36:51.774 --> 36:53.298
How much more?

37:00.000 --> 37:00.783
Please, Mel.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.873
What else do you want from me?

37:03.917 --> 37:05.745
I've done what you wanted.

37:05.788 --> 37:06.876
- [Mel] So far.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.009
And you've been
great, so thank you.

37:09.879 --> 37:10.924
But you need to do something

37:10.967 --> 37:13.013
about your Dave
problem, or I will.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.320
- What do you mean?

37:16.625 --> 37:18.018
Don't hurt him, Mel.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.628
Swear to God, don't hurt him.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.677
- [Mel] I'm gonna need you
to sleep for a little bit.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.939
- Mel, please.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.334
What did you give me?

37:29.377 --> 37:31.597
- [Mel] Just something
to help calm you down.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.035
- What did you give me, Mel?

37:37.167 --> 37:38.778
- [Mel] I'll see you in a bit.

37:49.919 --> 37:50.703
Shh.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.594
You won't believe
how famous you'll be.

38:13.987 --> 38:14.901
Sleep well.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.524
We may have a bit of a problem.

38:30.786 --> 38:31.657
- [Des] What is it?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.573
- [Dave] Hey, I
called you a bunch.

38:34.616 --> 38:36.052
I saw your latest post.

38:37.445 --> 38:38.228
Drinking, Des?

38:39.012 --> 38:40.056
The drinking?

38:42.015 --> 38:43.364
[Dave sighs]

38:43.408 --> 38:45.671
Did you really mean
the things you said?

38:45.714 --> 38:46.541
What's going on?

38:47.368 --> 38:48.630
I'm sorry I left.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.066
Call me.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.720
- So pathetic.

38:52.634 --> 38:53.983
What do you see in that loser?

38:55.550 --> 38:58.031
You can't let Dave get
in the way of your brand.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.817
- [Des] You want me to dump him.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.691
- I want you to text him
that he needs to be okay

39:05.734 --> 39:07.910
with whatever Des the
vlogger wants to do.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.087
And I'll film you.

39:12.219 --> 39:13.742
People will get
a kick out of it.

39:16.919 --> 39:17.659
[stun gun crackling]

39:17.703 --> 39:18.791
- Okay. I understand.

39:18.834 --> 39:19.618
I understand.

39:20.706 --> 39:21.446
- [Mel] Great!

39:22.795 --> 39:24.013
And action.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.061
Remember, positive vibes only.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.719
[sighs]

39:33.762 --> 39:34.502
- Hi, guys.

39:34.546 --> 39:35.329
It's me, Des.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.899
I just want to thank
all my new followers

39:39.942 --> 39:43.163
and for InTheKnow.com
for spreading the
word on their site,

39:44.251 --> 39:45.426
but there is been one person

39:45.470 --> 39:47.428
who hasn't been as
supportive as you guys.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.213
You guessed it.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.040
Dave.

39:54.217 --> 39:56.742
He's still away working
on his script for me,

39:56.785 --> 39:59.005
but I wanted to
let you guys know

39:59.048 --> 40:00.354
that I'm not gonna let you down,

40:00.398 --> 40:02.225
and give you front row seats

40:02.269 --> 40:04.837
to everything that happens
in our relationship.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.055
[Mel clicking tongue]

40:06.099 --> 40:06.882
- Des.

40:07.753 --> 40:08.580
Keep going.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.453
- Here's what I'll type.

40:15.064 --> 40:16.849
Hey, Dave.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.068
People are loving my new vlogs.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.898
I'd appreciate more support.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.683
I want to do even
more for my fans.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.428
[sighs]

40:33.996 --> 40:35.084
That's right.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.912
I want to do even
more for you guys.

40:41.787 --> 40:42.614
- He respond?

40:44.877 --> 40:45.573
Tell everyone.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.056
- So here's what
Dave wrote back.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.624
What the hell, Des?

40:52.667 --> 40:54.364
This isn't okay with me.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.105
Why are you doing this?

40:56.149 --> 40:57.063
For what?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.981
I guess Dave doesn't get it.

41:03.286 --> 41:05.071
- Text him that if he
doesn't support you,

41:05.114 --> 41:06.942
you don't want to
talk to him anymore.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.207
Do I have to persuade you again?

41:11.251 --> 41:12.165
[stun gun crackling]

41:12.208 --> 41:13.558
- Okay, okay, okay!

41:13.601 --> 41:15.168
I'll do it. Fine.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.256
I'll do it.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.831
You never supported me, Dave.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.835
You poke fun at
my acting skills,

41:29.878 --> 41:32.620
you don't get my
passion for jewelry,

41:32.664 --> 41:34.622
and now, you're
trying to keep me

41:34.666 --> 41:37.625
from being a successful vlogger.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.152
Just leave me alone, Dave.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.504
I don't need you.

41:46.547 --> 41:47.722
I don't want you.

41:48.897 --> 41:51.683
Stay away forever.

41:54.381 --> 41:56.296
Dave, I mean it.

41:58.690 --> 41:59.429
Goodbye.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.781
- [Mel] Show them
that you sent it.

42:07.307 --> 42:08.830
- Here you go, guys.

42:08.874 --> 42:10.049
Proof I have your back.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.573
[static crackling]

42:12.617 --> 42:13.574
- [Mel] Was perfect.

42:15.881 --> 42:17.926
- How much more, Mel?

42:17.970 --> 42:18.753
Please.

42:29.198 --> 42:31.200
- Your new video of you
telling Dave what's up

42:31.244 --> 42:33.289
is getting great reviews.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.596
And you know, a lot of
your fans are on your side.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.902
It's fantastic.

42:39.426 --> 42:41.559
And action.

42:50.045 --> 42:51.525
- As you can see,
I'm almost done

42:51.569 --> 42:53.919
with my new amethyst
gemstone necklace.

42:53.962 --> 42:55.877
I hope you guys like it.

42:55.921 --> 42:58.793
If you do, I'll make even
more so you guys can buy them.

42:58.837 --> 43:01.883
And if you do, I'll make
it worth your while.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.364
- That's great, Des.

43:04.407 --> 43:07.410
Doesn't it feel good getting
back to your jewelry?

43:08.934 --> 43:10.283
- Sure.

43:10.326 --> 43:12.546
That's all this was
ever supposed to be.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.548
- Right, that's it.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.202
It wasn't supposed
to help jumpstart

43:16.245 --> 43:18.247
your stagnant failure
of an acting career?

43:19.509 --> 43:20.815
I mean, a jewelry vlog?

43:20.859 --> 43:22.382
Really?

43:22.425 --> 43:25.994
Did you just pick a talent
out of a hat one day and say,

43:26.038 --> 43:29.519
oh, I hope this will get
someone to notice me.

43:29.563 --> 43:32.566
You're a fame whore with a
plan, just like everyone else.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.481
- I didn't want fame.

43:34.524 --> 43:37.397
I wanted exposure
for my jewelry line.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.444
- You showed your whole
life, your relationship.

43:41.488 --> 43:43.229
You've gotten your exposure.

43:43.272 --> 43:45.013
You're exposed.

43:45.057 --> 43:47.581
- That's not what I--
- Stop lying to yourself, Des.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.149
You wanted this.

43:51.759 --> 43:56.590
The comments, the adoration,
the posting on a trending site.

43:58.157 --> 44:01.595
You paraded around like
an altruistic person,

44:01.639 --> 44:05.686
but, really, you're just a
narcissistic piece of shit

44:05.730 --> 44:09.298
with all of the accolades
like everybody else.

44:09.342 --> 44:12.824
You are no better
and no different.

44:16.436 --> 44:18.133
- So that's what this is about.

44:19.395 --> 44:21.746
You're punishing me
because people like me.

44:21.789 --> 44:24.923
- And now, they like you
even more because of me,

44:24.966 --> 44:27.926
because of you completely
debasing yourself.

44:30.406 --> 44:32.887
You've been doing
the figurative, Des,

44:32.931 --> 44:34.628
but people love the literal.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.849
[static crackles]

44:37.892 --> 44:42.331
You're just a vacuous,
transparent hypocrite.

44:44.812 --> 44:45.900
You deserve this.

44:51.210 --> 44:52.167
What are you doing?!

44:52.211 --> 44:53.125
What the...

44:57.346 --> 44:59.653

45:03.526 --> 45:04.484

45:14.581 --> 45:15.669
Motherfucker!

45:25.853 --> 45:27.333
What am I gonna do with you?

45:29.509 --> 45:30.728
That was impressive.

45:31.903 --> 45:32.860
That was fun!

45:34.819 --> 45:36.429
Any other ideas floating around

45:36.472 --> 45:38.605
in that pretty little
head of yours, huh?!

45:38.648 --> 45:40.433
[Des panting]

45:40.476 --> 45:41.564
- I'm sorry.

45:41.608 --> 45:43.697
Please, please, don't kill me.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.481
That was stupid.

45:45.525 --> 45:46.395
I won't do it again.

45:46.439 --> 45:47.440
Please.

45:47.483 --> 45:48.267
Just don't kill me.

45:48.310 --> 45:49.311
- You gonna cooperate?

45:49.355 --> 45:51.444
- I promise. I promise!

45:51.487 --> 45:52.271
- Great.

45:54.621 --> 45:56.231
I'm glad you're back on board.

45:57.667 --> 45:59.495
We're gonna have
lots of fun together.

46:02.629 --> 46:03.456
I like feisty Des.

46:12.334 --> 46:13.509
And action.

46:16.469 --> 46:17.513
- Hey, guys!

46:17.557 --> 46:19.602
So I've accepted
another challenge.

46:19.646 --> 46:21.691
I wrote on my vlog that I
would hold this super hot

46:21.735 --> 46:23.215
curling iron for five seconds

46:23.258 --> 46:25.565
if you guys bought
500 bracelets.

46:25.608 --> 46:27.393
Looks like I've hit my mark.

46:27.436 --> 46:28.307
Thanks, guys.

46:28.350 --> 46:29.787
This is very exciting.

46:32.572 --> 46:33.312
Okay.

46:33.355 --> 46:33.921
Here we go.

46:35.531 --> 46:38.317
- [Mel] Drop some water on it
so they can see how hot it is.

46:45.193 --> 46:47.761
[water hissing]

46:49.981 --> 46:51.809
- See, I wasn't messing around.

46:53.288 --> 46:54.986
Now, I'm gonna count
really slowly for you guys

46:55.029 --> 46:56.596
so it's a full five seconds.

47:08.651 --> 47:09.522

even a second!

47:09.565 --> 47:10.784
- It's really freaking hot!

47:10.828 --> 47:12.655
- [Mel] If you think
you can't do it.

47:13.787 --> 47:15.267

47:21.142 --> 47:23.014
Okay, I just need
a second, please!

47:23.057 --> 47:24.232
Just a second.

47:29.411 --> 47:31.718
[sighs]

47:31.761 --> 47:33.154
Okay, here I go!

47:39.378 --> 47:40.858
One.

47:40.901 --> 47:42.468
Two.

47:42.511 --> 47:43.948

Ready?

48:16.894 --> 48:17.677
And go.

48:21.681 --> 48:24.249
- My hand hurts,
but it was worth it.

48:24.292 --> 48:26.642
That was tough, but I'm
glad I earned your business

48:26.686 --> 48:28.993
and learned I was
stronger than I thought.

48:29.036 --> 48:30.646
I'm excited for
all my new orders.

48:30.690 --> 48:31.734
Thanks, guys.

48:32.779 --> 48:34.041
- [Mel] Now, that's acting.

48:34.085 --> 48:34.824
Amazing.

48:36.087 --> 48:36.957
You know, you've been
doing so well, Des.

48:37.001 --> 48:38.916
You're really a natural at this.

48:40.700 --> 48:41.788
Have I told you that?

48:43.268 --> 48:44.008
'Cause you are.

48:53.626 --> 48:57.499
Looks like your precious
boyfriend won't take the hint.

48:57.543 --> 48:58.674
- [Dave] Des, talk to me.

48:58.718 --> 48:59.632
What the hell's wrong with you?

48:59.675 --> 49:01.416
Are you crazy?

49:01.460 --> 49:02.940
And now, you're
burning yourself?

49:04.245 --> 49:05.681
I'm coming over if
you don't respond.

49:07.727 --> 49:09.729
- Doesn't get what
it takes, does he?

49:10.730 --> 49:12.819
- He's gonna come for me, Mel.

49:12.862 --> 49:14.299
What are you gonna do then?

49:21.828 --> 49:23.830
Please, I'm sorry.

49:25.614 --> 49:27.529
I've gotten the viewers.

49:27.573 --> 49:30.271
- Yeah, and now, your vlog
is on all the trending sites.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.709
Look, this is what you wanted.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.625
You knew that there
were consequences.

49:42.414 --> 49:43.763
- He's gonna come here.

49:46.418 --> 49:48.333
- That'll be a shame, won't it?

49:50.030 --> 49:51.684
I have an idea.

49:51.727 --> 49:53.642
Why don't we make
sure he doesn't come?

49:57.733 --> 50:01.694
Dave, leave me the fuck alone.

50:01.737 --> 50:06.307
This vlog is more important
to me than you are.

50:06.351 --> 50:11.269
Stay away or I'll get a fucking
restraining order on you.

50:12.792 --> 50:16.578
You're no longer my priority.

50:16.622 --> 50:18.015
Bye forever.

50:21.844 --> 50:23.542
You think that'll keep him away?

50:26.893 --> 50:31.115
Trust me, one day, you'll
thank me for all of this.

50:33.682 --> 50:34.727
Or not.

50:38.992 --> 50:39.688
Des.

50:40.907 --> 50:41.821
You promised.

50:43.475 --> 50:46.782
And you know what happens
when you break a promise.

50:47.957 --> 50:48.697
- Okay.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.134
Okay.

50:50.177 --> 50:51.483
- And, babe, please stop
it with the tears, okay?

50:51.526 --> 50:53.137
There's nothing sexy about that.

50:54.007 --> 50:54.747
- I know.

50:54.790 --> 50:55.965
I'm sorry.

50:56.009 --> 50:57.445
- Stop saying sorry, okay?

50:57.489 --> 50:58.968
Come on.

50:59.012 --> 51:00.492
It's big girl time, okay?

51:00.535 --> 51:01.275
- Okay.

51:04.235 --> 51:07.368
- [Mel] And now, for
the grand finale.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.808
- And now, for the grand finale.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.124
- [Mel] That's good enough.

51:24.168 --> 51:25.865
You can stop there.

51:25.908 --> 51:27.171
- What?

51:27.214 --> 51:28.302
- This is totally
gonna go viral.

51:28.346 --> 51:30.304
Isn't that great?

51:30.348 --> 51:32.524
And you look so hot, by the way.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.439
Doesn't she, Josh?

51:34.482 --> 51:35.701
- [Josh] Yes, very.

51:44.753 --> 51:45.798
- [Mel] Your new post
has barely been up

51:45.841 --> 51:47.278
and it's already gone viral.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.715
That's a lot of new followers.

51:50.933 --> 51:53.066
That's a lot of new
people to see you.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.589
It'd be a shame to lose them.

51:55.721 --> 51:56.678
- Yeah.

51:56.722 --> 51:59.246
Real shame.
[phone beeping]

51:59.290 --> 52:01.161
- Let's see what this
asshole has to say.

52:04.556 --> 52:07.211
- [Dave] Des, I figured out
why Mel looks so familiar.

52:07.254 --> 52:08.995
She's BusyGirl88.

52:09.038 --> 52:10.953
She got shut down
for filming that--

52:10.997 --> 52:13.869
[phone beeps]

52:13.913 --> 52:15.741
- Wow!

52:15.784 --> 52:18.222
So you're BusyGirl88.

52:19.658 --> 52:21.877
So that's what this is.

52:21.921 --> 52:23.923
Am I your next adventure?

52:23.966 --> 52:25.185
Are you gonna take
me to the park

52:25.229 --> 52:27.231
and watch me kill myself
with a razor blade?!

52:27.274 --> 52:28.667
Am I your new best friend, Mel?!

52:28.710 --> 52:29.537
- Shut up!

52:29.581 --> 52:30.886
Shut the fuck up!

52:30.930 --> 52:33.541
You have no idea what
you're talking about!

52:33.585 --> 52:36.240
Why is it my fault that she
went through with it, huh?

52:36.283 --> 52:37.850
People see what they wanna see!

52:39.852 --> 52:41.158
I wanted to die too.

52:43.943 --> 52:45.988
[Mel grunts]

52:46.032 --> 52:48.077
- What does this have
to do with me, huh?!

52:48.121 --> 52:50.341
What do you want?!
- You know what I want!

52:52.386 --> 52:57.261
I want you and all the
other fake, plastic posers,

52:58.566 --> 53:00.046
pretending to have
a fucking life,

53:00.089 --> 53:02.788
to show the world something
it actually wants to see!

53:06.008 --> 53:09.186
But you're never gonna
understand that, are you, Des?

53:12.014 --> 53:13.059
- Film me.

53:16.149 --> 53:17.846
You're really done with me?

53:17.890 --> 53:18.934
- Aw.

53:18.978 --> 53:20.153
You gonna miss me?

53:20.197 --> 53:20.980
- [Des] No.

53:22.286 --> 53:23.635
- Congratulations.

Dave, I'm in here!

[door clacks]
- Des?

55:06.041 --> 55:06.825
- [Des] Call the police.

55:06.868 --> 55:08.130
She's gonna kill me.

55:12.787 --> 55:13.875
- There's nobody here.

55:14.963 --> 55:16.051
- [Des] I'm burning.

55:16.095 --> 55:17.401
- [Dave] Come on.

55:17.444 --> 55:18.227
- [Des] Ow.

55:24.190 --> 55:25.974

55:28.803 --> 55:29.674
Oh, my God.

55:29.717 --> 55:30.805
I'm sorry.

55:31.980 --> 55:33.025
Oh, my God, Des.

55:33.068 --> 55:34.374
I am so sorry.

55:34.418 --> 55:37.116
- [Des] I thought she
was gonna kill me.

55:37.159 --> 55:38.291
- [Dave] I'm here now.

55:39.074 --> 55:40.119
I'm here.

55:58.398 --> 55:59.486
Let's call the police.

56:00.661 --> 56:01.793
I should've never left.

56:03.969 --> 56:05.536
- [Des] I'm just
glad that it's over.

56:05.579 --> 56:06.363
- [Dave] Me too.

56:08.147 --> 56:10.149
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.

56:11.542 --> 56:13.282
- [Des] I'm just
glad that it's over.

56:17.461 --> 56:18.897
- [Dave] What's that doing here?

56:20.202 --> 56:21.552
- I don't know.

56:21.595 --> 56:23.031
- [Dave] That's
her webcam, right?

56:23.075 --> 56:23.858
- Yeah.

56:25.207 --> 56:26.295
- [Dave] Why is that still here?

56:26.339 --> 56:27.253
- I don't know!

56:32.911 --> 56:33.825
- Stay here.

56:33.868 --> 56:35.174
I'm gonna go check the house.

56:35.217 --> 56:36.480
- [Des] No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, please.

56:36.523 --> 56:37.916
Dave, don't go.
- I'll be fine.

leave me, please!

Don't leave. No!

56:41.136 --> 56:42.181
Dave! No!

56:48.796 --> 56:50.058
- What the fuck?

56:53.627 --> 56:55.760
The cameras are
still in here too!

56:58.719 --> 57:00.242
You're blinking.

57:00.286 --> 57:01.679
You're still on, aren't you?

57:03.245 --> 57:04.812

Dave?!

57:17.956 --> 57:19.610
Dave, what happened?!

57:22.482 --> 57:23.831
- [Dave] I'm gonna
check the fuse box.

57:23.875 --> 57:25.746
It's probably nothing.

57:28.532 --> 57:30.882

58:37.252 --> 58:38.427
Ready whenever you are.

58:45.957 --> 58:46.871
- Hey, Dave.

59:09.371 --> 59:11.765
How's the screenplay coming?

59:14.551 --> 59:15.334
Mm.

59:16.335 --> 59:18.424
You really shouldn't have come.

59:19.599 --> 59:21.558
We didn't want you here.

59:22.863 --> 59:24.212
But it's so sweet
you remembered me.

59:25.997 --> 59:28.434
I didn't know you were such
a big fan of BusyGirl88.

59:28.477 --> 59:30.479
What do you see in
this guy anyway?

59:32.351 --> 59:35.093
He's so ugh.

59:37.269 --> 59:41.316
Maybe your fans would like
to see him in our video, huh?

59:41.360 --> 59:42.404
What do you think?

59:44.319 --> 59:45.233
- I hope you fucking die.

59:45.277 --> 59:46.408
I swear to God.
- Oh.

59:51.326 --> 59:55.026
Your fans, maybe not,
but my fans would.

59:56.505 --> 59:59.944
I found a place that appreciates
the sorta thing I do.

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:03.948
They appreciated
my suicide video.

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.340
They appreciate me.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.692
It's a small community,
but it's thriving.

01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:13.261
What do you say, Des?

01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:14.959
You ready to be a star there?

01:00:15.002 --> 01:00:16.656
- No--
- Oh, shut up, Dave!

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:21.313
Maybe they'd like to see
us do stuff together, huh?

01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:26.448
What kind of stuff you
think they'd like to see?

01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:30.583
Mm.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:31.366
Oh!

Oh, there's the grand
finale that's promised.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:39.897
And I think Des would
wanna do the grand finale.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.334
If not, you can watch
me slit his throat.

01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:44.945
Huh, what do you think Dave?!

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:46.294
What do you say, Des?

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:50.255
Ready to be a star?
- Please, don't hurt him.

01:00:50.298 --> 01:00:51.517
Please.
- Oh.

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:53.693
It's up to you.

- I'm sorry.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.068
I'll do it, I just, I
need a minute, okay?

01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:23.549
- Dave!

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:25.377
We're gonna need
you to be quiet.

01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:33.385
- I don't want her
to hurt you, okay?

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.387
We're gonna get through
this, I promise.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:37.781
I'm so sorry.

01:01:37.824 --> 01:01:39.696
I'm so sorry.
- [Josh] Let's get back to it.

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:41.480
We're ready to do this.

01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:42.960
- [Mel] Slow down, Joshie.

01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:44.483

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:46.964
Places!

01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:52.186
Dave, aren't you so glad

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.319
that your girlfriend
got back into acting?

[fingers snapping]

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.985
- You can't show
this on the internet.

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.553
- [Mel] This isn't for
your type of internet.

01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:13.991
I think you know that.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:15.732
- I'm sorry, but...

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:17.646
- Nope! Time's up. Josh.
- No, no, no, no, no,

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.084

please don't, please don't!

How about...

You know, I do
feel bad for Dave.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.616
I mean, he warned
you not to do it,

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:25.965
and you opened up your life

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:29.142
and he's a part of
it, so here we are.

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:32.798
Dave.

01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:36.628

Everything's gonna be all right.

Is this it?

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.691
- [Mel] What are
you talking about?

01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:52.127
- You cut off one little toe,

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:55.522
and now, you're gonna kill
me with my fucking tool

Maybe we can just stop and
do another milk challenge

and your audience thinks
your lame, BusyGirl88.

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:38.435
- I'm gonna enjoy killing you.

01:09:39.871 --> 01:09:41.394

it before you even let

01:09:41.438 --> 01:09:43.004
Josh get to have me?

01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:47.357
He does all that work for you

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:49.185
and he doesn't
even get a taste?!

01:09:52.752 --> 01:09:53.971
Is that how jealous you are?

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:58.455
You won't even let your audience
see what they wanna see?

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.980
Isn't that right, Joshie?

01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:03.590
But your girlfriend
won't let you.

Oh, what's the matter, Mel?

Are you worried what
your precious fan base

01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:41.079
will think of you now?

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:46.606
Maybe Joshie can help me
edit the finish cut later.
