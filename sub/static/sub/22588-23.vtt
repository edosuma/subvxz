Why, that's not Batman.
That's the Riddler.

'Surprise! Surprise!'

The figure of Batman stolen?

01:51.128 --> 01:53.294
It's the work of the Riddler.

01:53.296 --> 01:57.331
Don't touch a thing.
We'll take care of it.

01:58.433 --> 02:01.067
Well, you heard, chief.
The Riddler is at it again.

02:01.069 --> 02:04.470
Two weeks out of jail,
and he's up to his old tricks.

02:04.472 --> 02:07.639
I knew it was too good to last.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.475
There's only one thing to do.

02:11.477 --> 02:15.278
We may never know the identity
of the man behind the mask..

02:15.280 --> 02:20.983
...but he's the only one

He's just come in, sir.
I'll get him for you.

02:33.026 --> 02:35.227
I thought Lima
was the capital of Ecuador.

02:35.229 --> 02:38.663
Now as you can see, I was right.
It's the capital of Peru.

02:38.665 --> 02:42.466
Oh, I just love this game of
capitals. It's so educational.

02:42.468 --> 02:46.203
Not only that, if we don't know
about our friends to the south

02:46.205 --> 02:48.939
how can we carry on
our good neighbor policy?

02:48.941 --> 02:51.041
- Ahem.
- Yes, Alfred.

02:51.043 --> 02:53.576
It's the Bat-phone, sir.

02:54.411 --> 02:56.178
Oh, Aunt Harriet,
I forgot to tell you

02:56.180 --> 02:59.181
Dick and I are having dinner
with an old college chum.

02:59.183 --> 03:02.050
He's promised to show Dick
how to tie flies.

03:02.052 --> 03:03.351
He's an expert fisherman.

03:03.353 --> 03:06.520
Let's hurry, Dick,
or we're gonna be late.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.121

05:22.774 --> 05:24.306
He must be kidding.
That's too easy.

05:24.308 --> 05:26.341
We figured that one out
ourselves.

05:26.343 --> 05:27.508
By wonder, it's a newspaper.

05:27.510 --> 05:30.811
You know well how
the Riddler likes to taunt us

05:30.813 --> 05:31.912
with these disguised clues.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.948
Clues that always reveal
whatever plot he's hatching.

05:34.950 --> 05:38.484
This pause here is where
the tricky paint gun went off.

05:38.486 --> 05:40.185
'Illustrious friends..'

05:40.187 --> 05:41.486
Here comes the second riddle.

05:41.488 --> 05:45.089
'...if that little riddle
is too hard for you'

05:45.091 --> 05:46.457

05:46.459 --> 05:52.529
'What has branches
and leaves and no bark? Hmm?'

05:52.531 --> 05:53.563
That's all there is.

05:53.565 --> 05:55.398
There's always
some definite connection

05:55.400 --> 05:59.535
between the answers to his
riddles and his nefarious plans.

05:59.537 --> 06:04.540
What has leaves
and branches but no bark?

06:04.542 --> 06:07.409
Hey! A book has leaves.

06:07.411 --> 06:09.544
But a book has no branches.

06:09.546 --> 06:11.846
Yes, but a library does!

06:11.848 --> 06:13.948
Then, the answer
to the first riddle

06:13.950 --> 06:17.017
could have been book
instead of newspaper.

06:17.019 --> 06:18.518
You've done it again, chum.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.187
The answer is library,
but what library.

06:21.189 --> 06:25.357
If I know the Riddler
it'll be the biggest library.

06:25.359 --> 06:26.391
The Gotham City Library.

06:26.393 --> 06:28.393
But what'd he want
with a public library?

06:28.395 --> 06:31.262
We'll never find out
standing here.

06:31.264 --> 06:33.364
Let's go, Robin!

06:34.032 --> 06:36.466
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> in a secret hideaway</i>

06:36.468 --> 06:41.037
<i> beneath this innocent-looking</i>
<i> candle factory.</i>

06:49.946 --> 06:54.849
Oh. Oh, if only this
were the real Batman?

06:54.851 --> 07:00.955
Oh! Tis' a consummation
devoutly to be wished

07:00.957 --> 07:05.059
that this too,
too solid flesh would melt

07:05.061 --> 07:08.929
thaw, and resolve itself
into a dew.

07:08.931 --> 07:13.533
Oh, Riddler, honey,
that's beautiful.

07:13.535 --> 07:16.369
I wrote it myself.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.174
Little did they suspect
the real reason

07:22.176 --> 07:25.210
why I stole
the wax figure of Batman.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.979
I knew, I knew those
dull customs inspectors

07:27.981 --> 07:30.581
would never think of looking
for this revolutionary

07:30.583 --> 07:33.016
new ring of wax
universal solvent

07:33.018 --> 07:37.120
in the mannequin
of their precious champion.

07:37.122 --> 07:38.454
Big deal. Wax is wax.

07:38.456 --> 07:40.289
What's so special
about this stuff?

07:40.291 --> 07:43.458
Oh, you don't know
my pretty little, Moth

07:43.460 --> 07:45.960
what universal solvent is.

07:45.962 --> 07:47.294
It can eat through anything.

07:47.296 --> 07:50.530
This remarkable wax can be found
only in the hives

07:50.532 --> 07:52.932
of the Cognac district
of France.

07:52.934 --> 07:55.134
No wonder
the United States government

07:55.136 --> 07:56.435
has banned its importation.

07:56.437 --> 07:59.538
It might fall
into the wrong hands.

07:59.540 --> 08:03.341
'Why, with this illegally
imported substance'

08:03.343 --> 08:08.379
there's no vault I cannot enter.

08:10.182 --> 08:16.986
Hear me, world.
Nothing can stop me now.

08:39.943 --> 08:41.077
Ain't he ever gonna move?

08:41.078 --> 08:43.078
Yeah, we gotta
get in the vault.

08:43.081 --> 08:45.481
Remember, it is better

08:45.483 --> 08:50.819
to light one little candle
than to curse the darkness.

09:19.448 --> 09:21.982
Quickly, Moth. Batman's had time
to solve my clue.

09:21.984 --> 09:25.118
Go downstairs
and keep a sharp lookout.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.752
Okay.

09:29.388 --> 09:31.422
It won't be long now.

09:31.424 --> 09:32.656
That rare old book.

09:32.658 --> 09:34.858
The lost treasures
of the Incas

09:34.860 --> 09:38.061
will soon be in my hands.

09:38.063 --> 09:42.031
Ain't somebody bound to hear us
when we break into the vault?

09:42.033 --> 09:43.132
Don't talk, stupid.

09:43.134 --> 09:45.701
Why do you think I went
to so much trouble

09:45.703 --> 09:50.172
to smuggle in
this universal wax solvent? Hmm?

09:58.548 --> 10:03.618
Genius. So far so good.

10:47.595 --> 10:49.228
Ah!

10:49.230 --> 10:51.096
Go on.

10:59.772 --> 11:03.975
Now, remember, no writing
in the margins.

11:11.717 --> 11:14.018
Heavens to Betsy!

11:14.020 --> 11:16.653
It can't be, but it is.

11:16.655 --> 11:17.987
The dynamic duo.

11:17.989 --> 11:19.955
Can I be of any help
to you at all?

11:19.957 --> 11:22.958
Have you seen any unusual
looking people around here?

11:22.960 --> 11:26.027
Unusual?
In what way unusual?

11:26.029 --> 11:26.694
Their garb.

11:26.696 --> 11:29.496
For instance, a man wearing
a bright green suit

11:29.498 --> 11:31.931
with big black
question marks on it.

11:31.933 --> 11:33.132
Let me think a moment.

11:33.134 --> 11:35.267
No, I can't say that I have
off hand.

11:35.269 --> 11:37.769
I see many people
in the course of the day.

11:37.771 --> 11:41.038
We've serious reason
to believe that a serious crime

11:41.040 --> 11:41.905
will be committed here.

11:41.907 --> 11:43.273
- 'We sure have.'
- 'Oh, dear.'

11:43.275 --> 11:46.843
Where's the vault in which you
store your most precious books?

11:46.845 --> 11:50.179
It's upstairs.
Follow me.

11:58.121 --> 12:01.723
Boss, this is Moth.
They're on their way up.

12:01.725 --> 12:03.624
I'll be ready for 'em.

12:03.626 --> 12:06.193
Hey, here it is, boss.

12:07.862 --> 12:09.562
Oh!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.596
Oh!

12:14.600 --> 12:18.035
At last I found it.

12:18.270 --> 12:23.340
This will lead me right to
the lost treasure of the Incas.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.976
Every greedy bone in my body

12:26.978 --> 12:33.048
cries out,
"Huzzah! Huzzah!"

12:36.285 --> 12:40.054
My stars! Look at that hole
and the lock's gone.

12:40.056 --> 12:43.190
Careful, Robin,
this looks like a robbery.

12:43.192 --> 12:45.926
Wait here, Ms. Prentice.

12:53.167 --> 12:58.704
As you can see, Batman,
by the deadly weapons we hold

12:58.706 --> 12:59.938
you'd be fools to move.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.740
- What are you doing here?
- Checking out a book.

13:02.742 --> 13:06.744
- Checking out a book?
- Exactly, Boy Wonder.

13:06.746 --> 13:08.779
Lost treasures
of the Incas.

13:08.781 --> 13:10.714
What'd he want
with a book like that?

13:10.716 --> 13:14.284
Who can explain the devious mind
of an arch criminal?

13:14.286 --> 13:16.386
You'll never get away
with this, Riddler.

13:16.388 --> 13:19.956
Would you like
to make a little wager?

13:19.958 --> 13:21.390
I never gamble.

13:47.015 --> 13:49.216
Holy mucilage!

13:50.918 --> 13:54.453
I can't move my feet!
I'm stuck to the floor.

13:54.455 --> 13:55.787
Yes, it's my own concoction.

13:55.789 --> 13:59.223
I call it Dr. Riddlers
Instant Forever Stick

13:59.225 --> 14:01.792
Invisible Wax Emulsion.

14:03.428 --> 14:04.293
Boss, you hit the alarm.

14:04.295 --> 14:09.398
An unfortunate error on my part,
but lucky for you, Batman.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.399
Let's get outta here, boss.

14:10.401 --> 14:13.101
Since you'll be sticking
around for a little while

14:13.103 --> 14:14.969
I'll leave you
a riddle to work on.

14:14.971 --> 14:20.407
The more you take away,
the larger it grows.

14:24.245 --> 14:26.779
'What is it?'

14:33.185 --> 14:35.052
Look, they're gone!

14:35.054 --> 14:38.989
We must get out of this.
I'll try the laser gun.

14:41.259 --> 14:43.459
What devilish sticky stuff.

14:43.461 --> 14:45.327
If only the Riddler's
inventive mind

14:45.329 --> 14:46.795
could be channeled for good

14:46.797 --> 14:50.131
what a better world
this would be.

14:50.133 --> 14:51.398
It's working, Robin.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.532
The wax is beginning
to melt.

14:52.534 --> 14:54.267
'Are you alright in there?'

14:54.269 --> 14:57.403
Yes. It's safe
to come in now, Ms. Prentice.

14:57.405 --> 15:00.372
Oh! Saints above!
How did that hole get there?

15:00.374 --> 15:02.006
- That's it!
- What is it, old chum?

15:02.008 --> 15:03.907
The answer to that riddle.
Don't you see?

15:03.909 --> 15:07.210
The more you take away from
a hole, the larger it grows.

15:07.212 --> 15:10.546
You're right!
What can that mean?

15:10.548 --> 15:13.081
- Unless..
- Yes?

15:20.488 --> 15:24.491
There's a strange
waxy substance here.

15:24.493 --> 15:25.492
Could this be his clue?

15:25.494 --> 15:27.927
But how was this done?
I heard no explosion.

15:27.929 --> 15:31.363
We must take this back to the
Bat-cave at once and analyze it.

15:31.365 --> 15:36.534
Unless I miss my guess, I'm
holding the answer in my hand.

15:56.187 --> 15:58.488
We've no time to waste.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.622
Let's get this sample of wax

15:59.624 --> 16:01.890
into the hyperspectrographic
analyzer.

16:01.892 --> 16:06.628
This should tell us what makes
up this waxy substance.

16:08.197 --> 16:10.698
Aha! It's just as I thought.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.634
Nitrogen is one
of the component elements.

16:13.636 --> 16:15.602
That orange color.
Doesn't that mean uranium?

16:15.604 --> 16:18.805
Right on the nose, Robin.
You're catching on fast.

16:18.807 --> 16:20.473
No kidding, gee!

16:20.475 --> 16:21.974
But what about that blue line?

16:21.976 --> 16:23.909
That one's easy.
It's sodium.

16:23.911 --> 16:27.045
Of course, this is
a universal wax solvent.

16:27.047 --> 16:29.680
So that's how
they got into that vault.

16:29.682 --> 16:31.948
If the Riddler left this
as a clue

16:31.950 --> 16:33.449
I don't get it, do you?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.951
There's something here
that escapes me.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.987
Nitrogen, uranium, sodium.

16:38.989 --> 16:40.922
What could it
possibly mean?

16:40.924 --> 16:44.025
Well, if we take the first three
letters of those elements

16:44.027 --> 16:46.527
it spells NUS,
but that doesn't mean anything.

16:46.529 --> 16:49.796
Reverse the order
and what do you have?

16:49.798 --> 16:50.696
SUN.

16:50.698 --> 16:52.964
Of course,
that's got to be it.

16:52.966 --> 16:54.665
But what's it supposed to mean?

16:54.667 --> 16:55.632
Robin, I'm surprised at you.

16:55.634 --> 16:57.467
You're studying
French in school.

16:57.469 --> 16:58.935
What's the French
word for sun?

16:58.937 --> 17:01.037
-<i> Soleil.</i>
- Correct.

17:01.039 --> 17:03.572
The Riddler has left us
a clear indication

17:03.574 --> 17:05.941
of where he intends
to strike next.

17:05.943 --> 17:10.145
Back at <i> Madame</i> Soleil's
Wax Museum.

17:10.146 --> 17:13.181
What are we waiting for?

17:24.759 --> 17:26.526
<i> Madame</i> Soleil?

17:26.528 --> 17:28.694
<i> Madame</i> Soleil?

17:28.696 --> 17:31.263
It's Batman and Robin.

17:31.265 --> 17:33.765
Are you here?

17:33.767 --> 17:36.167
Such vandalism.

17:36.501 --> 17:40.570
What a disastrous unveiling
this must have been.

17:41.505 --> 17:44.607
Boy, wax museums
are sure spooky.

17:44.609 --> 17:47.743
You think the Riddler's
here somewhere?

17:51.647 --> 17:56.584
<i> For heaven's sake,</i>
<i> caped crusaders, watch out!</i>

17:58.019 --> 17:59.686
Ah!

18:03.057 --> 18:03.790
Good shot, boss.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.627
Ah, music hath the charm
to soothe the savage beast.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.661
You sure soothed them, boss.

18:08.663 --> 18:11.030
You soothed them right
to sleep with that thing.

18:11.032 --> 18:14.233
- They look dead to me.
- Just drugged, my pet.

18:14.235 --> 18:18.237
Why kill them fast
when watching them die slowly

18:18.239 --> 18:22.007
is so much more entertaining.

18:25.110 --> 18:27.177
Ah!

18:34.218 --> 18:36.786
Beauty after all..

18:36.788 --> 18:40.689
...is in the eye
of the beholder.

18:54.036 --> 18:55.302
Ah!

18:55.304 --> 18:57.203
'Well, what do you know?'

18:57.205 --> 19:00.906
A dividend
I hadn't considered.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.675
What a haul
this day has yielded.

19:03.677 --> 19:07.679
First the rare old book and
the lost treasure of the Incas.

19:07.681 --> 19:13.217
Then, the invincible Batman
and Robin and now..

19:14.320 --> 19:19.823
...the famous Batmobile
for my very own.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.327
Watch it, boss.
It's loaded with burglar alarm.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.263
Don't you think I know that?

19:28.331 --> 19:31.299
A little snip here.

19:31.301 --> 19:34.001
A little snip there.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.237
Now, it's safe to drive.

19:38.239 --> 19:39.371
You're gonna drive
the Batmobile?

19:39.373 --> 19:42.140
Finders keepers, losers weepers
as I always say.

19:42.142 --> 19:42.940
What do we do, boss?

19:42.942 --> 19:45.976
Take Batman and Robin
out to the candle factory

19:45.978 --> 19:49.846
and I'll meet you there.

20:17.906 --> 20:20.307
We better get our everyday
clothes back on.

20:20.309 --> 20:21.841
We look too suspicious this way.

20:21.843 --> 20:23.876
Sure, boss,
just as soon as we get

20:23.878 --> 20:25.377
these two prized packages
inside.

20:25.379 --> 20:28.713
Hey, look.
Look, he's coming to.

20:28.715 --> 20:33.884
Oh, he, he looks so handsome
beneath that mask.

20:33.886 --> 20:38.088
A Diamondback rattlesnake
is a handsome creature too

20:38.090 --> 20:39.355
but dangerous and deadly.

20:39.357 --> 20:42.925
Remember, Moth,
Batman is our sworn enemy.

20:42.927 --> 20:48.163
We can ill afford
such emotions as pity.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.798
Where am I?

20:50.800 --> 20:52.166
Ah, you could say you're

20:52.168 --> 20:56.036
in the proverbial pickle,
Batman.

20:56.038 --> 20:58.204
Take them in.

21:17.457 --> 21:19.825
Robin, do you hear me?

21:19.827 --> 21:23.161
Batman, what,
what happened to us?

21:23.163 --> 21:27.198
It seems you have been
overpowered again.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.365
But how?

21:28.367 --> 21:32.902
The last thing I remember,
we were in the wax museum.

21:32.904 --> 21:36.305
We'd just passed
the revolutionary war scene.

21:36.307 --> 21:38.273
You're getting warm.

21:38.275 --> 21:40.074
So that's how it was done.

21:40.076 --> 21:43.977
- How what was done?
- Oh, it's so clear now.

21:43.979 --> 21:47.246
We were victimized
by a repeating blowgun.

21:47.248 --> 21:52.451
Holy iodine! So that's why
the back of my neck smarts.

21:56.355 --> 21:57.388
The wax is hot enough now, boss.

21:57.390 --> 22:01.325
If they want a life-like figure
of their precious Batman

22:01.327 --> 22:04.461
for the wax museum,
we'll give it to them.

22:04.463 --> 22:08.164
We'll even throw in
a dividend.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.865
Robin!

22:10.399 --> 22:11.132
You fiend!

22:11.134 --> 22:14.468
Sticks and stones
may break my bones

22:14.470 --> 22:17.904
but names will never hurt me.

22:18.772 --> 22:24.777
Matches, start the motor.
Slowly.

22:24.779 --> 22:27.746
Very slowly.

22:27.748 --> 22:30.281
Oh, I want to savor

22:30.283 --> 22:36.221
each sweet delicious moment
of this.

22:36.223 --> 22:38.189
Got you, boss.

22:42.259 --> 22:46.161
Riddler, tell me why you removed
my wax figure

22:46.163 --> 22:47.529
from the <i> Madame</i> Soleil's?

22:47.531 --> 22:50.999
How else could I smuggle in
that revolutionary

22:51.001 --> 22:52.900
new ring of wax solvent?

22:52.902 --> 22:54.401
But why go to all that trouble?

22:54.403 --> 22:55.935
Wouldn't TNT
have been much simpler?

22:55.937 --> 23:00.873
Have you ever been in a quiet
library when TNT went off?

23:00.875 --> 23:02.875
It makes a frightening noise.

23:02.877 --> 23:04.943
Why did you steal
that rare old book

23:04.945 --> 23:07.145
on the lost treasure
of the Inca's?

23:07.147 --> 23:08.179
What possible meaning

23:08.181 --> 23:11.982
could a scholarly book
like that have for you?

23:11.984 --> 23:16.386
For two people about
to become human candles

23:16.388 --> 23:19.255
you have a lot of questions.

23:19.257 --> 23:20.923
I'm always interested

23:20.925 --> 23:23.091
in the way
the criminal mind works.

23:23.093 --> 23:26.561
Well, then I'll tell you.

23:27.229 --> 23:30.297
Within that rare old book

23:30.299 --> 23:32.599
I found an ancient Incan riddle

23:32.601 --> 23:35.168
which will lead me
right to

23:35.170 --> 23:39.305
the fabled lost treasure
of the Inca's.

23:39.307 --> 23:40.539
You must be mad.

23:40.541 --> 23:43.608
The lost treasures
of the Inca's is only a legend.

23:43.610 --> 23:47.411
Ah, but that's where
you're mistaken, Batman.

23:47.413 --> 23:50.680
The treasure is real.
Very real.

23:50.682 --> 23:58.020
But unfortunately
you won't be around to see it.

24:04.259 --> 24:05.692
<i> Infamy of infamies!</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:10.296
<i> Can this be the end</i>
<i> of our beloved caped crusaders?</i>

24:10.298 --> 24:12.231
<i> Will Batman wax serious?</i>

24:12.233 --> 24:17.202
<i> For the sake of our heroes,</i>
<i> let's think positively!</i>

24:17.204 --> 24:20.672
<i> But it looks bad,</i>
<i> very bad.</i>

24:20.674 --> 24:23.307
<i> How can we wait</i>
<i> until tomorrow night?</i>

24:23.309 --> 24:28.378
<i> Same Bat-time,</i>
<i> same Bat-channel.</i>
