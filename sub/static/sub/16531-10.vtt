00:01.335 --> 00:03.504
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.537 --> 00:05.706
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.744
Previously on Empire...
We're Empire's
original power couple.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.580
Not Andre and that bobblehead.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.148
I'm gonna get back
at the both of 'em.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.584
Relax.
Xavier took credit for my idea.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.752
I'll teach you a little
something about true payback.

00:18.786 --> 00:22.590
You gonna get your ass
on that stage, clean and sober.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.658
I just need my pills.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.959
Just got to get to the show,
you know that.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.897
(yells)

00:29.930 --> 00:31.499
I love you.
I love you, too.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.734
And you're going to rehab, okay?

00:33.767 --> 00:35.203
What?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.005
EDISON: Angelo
drunk-drove into a lake,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.908
saving himself while leaving
a poor innocent girl to drown.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.076
What?

00:42.110 --> 00:43.677
You respect the hierarchy.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.746
I pull the strings here
until it's time.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.580
Time for what?

00:46.614 --> 00:48.449
Time to kill my father.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.354
While Marley gave you In Control

00:53.387 --> 00:56.590
and Dre gave you The Chronic,

00:56.624 --> 00:59.260
I give you Inferno.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.529
*

01:01.562 --> 01:04.098
* Burn it, burn it up now,
burn it up *

01:04.132 --> 01:06.934
* Burn it,
burn it up now, burn it up *

01:06.967 --> 01:09.703
* We gon' bring the fire,
yeah, yeah *

01:09.737 --> 01:11.939
* We gon' bring
the fire, yeah, yeah *

01:11.972 --> 01:14.608
* Blow torch, furnace,
matches, lighters *

01:14.642 --> 01:17.211
* Candles, ovens,
electrical wires *

01:17.245 --> 01:19.480
* Petroleum, lava,
charcoal, stars *

01:19.513 --> 01:22.483
* They're all on fire
just like Remy Ma now *

01:22.516 --> 01:25.153
* Hip-hop and R&B,
yeah, I be blazing that *

01:25.186 --> 01:26.454
* A capella, instrumental *

01:26.487 --> 01:27.955
* Either way, I'm flaming that *

01:27.988 --> 01:30.291
* H-E-L-L, that's where
they made me at *

01:30.324 --> 01:31.892
* An artist and arsonist *

01:31.925 --> 01:33.494
* I'm a pyromaniac *

01:33.527 --> 01:35.896
* Exploded on the scene,
then I heat it up... *

01:35.929 --> 01:37.665
Damn, Lucious.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.501
You said you was gonna
bring the heat, but damn!

01:40.534 --> 01:42.803
Well, it's about time.

01:42.836 --> 01:47.741
For the last year, I've been
attacked from all sides.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.809
Gangsters, feds,

01:48.842 --> 01:49.843
even family.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.146
Yeah, speaking
of which...

01:52.180 --> 01:54.982
* Taking over, that mean
we are taking everything *

01:55.015 --> 01:56.984
* We gonna make it hot
like Inferno... *

01:57.017 --> 01:58.586
Nice of you
to announce

01:58.619 --> 02:01.155
your little project
while Jamal's still in rehab.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.656
It must be because

02:02.690 --> 02:03.824
you're still
threatened by him.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.659
I forgot
he was even doing music.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.262
You should have given me
the heads-up, Lucious.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.664
Theoretically,
we are co-CEO.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.666
Theoretically,
you weren't talking to me.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.168
Well, I'm speaking
to you now.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.437
* We gon' bring the fire,
yeah, yeah *

02:16.470 --> 02:18.439
* Picture me without fireworks
for lungs *

02:18.472 --> 02:21.008
* C-4 for brains,
nitroglycerine for a tongue *

02:21.041 --> 02:23.877
* Temperature rising
as soon as I hit the room *

02:23.911 --> 02:26.013
* It's electric, my biometric
belong in hell's tomb... *

02:26.046 --> 02:27.215
(whoops)

02:27.248 --> 02:29.016
You gonna tell your fans
that you are stepping down

02:29.049 --> 02:31.185
to work on your project,

02:31.219 --> 02:33.721
leaving me sole CEO
of Empire.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.524
That's for dry snitching,
trying to destroy Angelo.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.858
(chuckles)

02:37.891 --> 02:40.127
Yeah, you play with me
if you want to.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.363
No, I don't play.
I war.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.031
You want war, Cookie?

02:44.064 --> 02:45.233
Fire a shot.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.534
Get ready.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.068
* Potholes are flame pits *

02:48.101 --> 02:50.304
* Freddy Krueger your face,
ignite your grill *

02:50.338 --> 02:52.473
* See, I'm a fire starter,
you a fire drill... *

02:52.506 --> 02:54.375
Damn, Remy Ma hot.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.543
I already talked
to Lucious

02:55.576 --> 02:57.077
about Tiana
doing one of her tracks.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.646
Before you talked to me?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.315
* I'm sick, it's bad
and I'm a rapper... *

03:01.349 --> 03:03.417
You're gonna get your own track
on the album, don't worry.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.052
* He said,
"Rem, you got a fever" *

03:05.085 --> 03:06.720
* You too hot,
ain't no one touching you *

03:06.754 --> 03:08.055
* Should have
third-degree burns *

03:08.088 --> 03:10.157
* And you highly combustible *
* Burn *

03:10.190 --> 03:12.560
* We gon' burn it up
like Inferno, burn *

03:12.593 --> 03:15.263
* We gon' make it hot
like Inferno, burn *

03:15.296 --> 03:17.831
* We gon' bring the fire,
yeah, yeah *

03:17.865 --> 03:20.234
* We gon' bring
the fire, yeah, yeah *

03:20.268 --> 03:23.237
* We gon make it hot
like Inferno, burn *

03:23.271 --> 03:25.739
* You gonna have to open up
a window, burn *

03:25.773 --> 03:28.576
* We gon' bring the fire,
yeah, yeah *

03:28.609 --> 03:30.744
* We gon' bring
the fire, yeah, yeah. *

03:30.778 --> 03:33.080
(crowd cheering)

03:33.113 --> 03:35.416
LUCIOUS:
The incredible Remy Ma.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.951
Damn, girl, amazing.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.420
And my man, Brikk!

03:39.453 --> 03:41.622
Give it up for them.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.657
(cheering continues)

03:46.960 --> 03:48.596
Now, as y'all know,

03:48.629 --> 03:51.465
I was forged in the fires
of Philadelphia streets.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.368
And I took that energy
and I turned it

03:54.402 --> 03:57.771
into one album, into
another platinum-selling album,

03:57.805 --> 04:00.040
into another
platinum-selling album.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.810
And now, with Inferno,
(crowd cheers)

04:02.843 --> 04:06.447
I retake my rightful place
at the top of hip-hop,

04:06.480 --> 04:07.948
at the top of my game.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.116
WOMAN:
Who is that?

04:09.149 --> 04:11.285
LUCIOUS:
At the top of the Empire!

04:11.319 --> 04:12.986
(crowd murmuring)
MAN: What's going on?

04:13.987 --> 04:14.955
MAN:
Yo, man, check her out.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.690
(crowd murmuring, shouting)

04:20.093 --> 04:21.395
COOKIE:
Hello, everybody!

04:21.429 --> 04:22.963
(crowd cheers)

04:22.996 --> 04:25.499
This is Lucious Lyon's
dear mama.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.335
Leah Walker.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.503
WOMAN: Leah Walker?
MAN: Didn't she die?

04:29.537 --> 04:32.473
And she was so excited backstage
to watch her baby boy

04:32.506 --> 04:34.007
out here,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.843
talking about
all his fabulousness.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.411
She just want to
come out here

04:37.445 --> 04:38.679
and tell y'all hey.
Go ahead, mama.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.913
(microphone feedback hums)

04:39.947 --> 04:41.315
Hi.

04:41.349 --> 04:44.352
WOMAN: Didn't she commit suicide
in the "Boom Boom" video?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.019
I'm Leah.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.990
THIRSTY:
Yo, get out there, Cho!

04:50.023 --> 04:51.258
I'm Dwight's...

04:51.291 --> 04:52.660
STEVE:
Hey, everybody.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.861
You guys have
your press packets.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.929
Lucious is on his way
to the studio right now

04:55.963 --> 04:57.164
to start work on Inferno.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.499
In the meantime,

04:58.532 --> 05:01.001
please check for updates
on Empire XStream. Thanks, guys.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.870
You a liar!

05:02.903 --> 05:05.072
(crowd clamoring)
I thought she was dead!

05:08.976 --> 05:10.678
How was that for a shot?

05:10.711 --> 05:13.381
Hit any vital organs?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.422
*

05:26.394 --> 05:27.695
THIRSTY:
I mean, as co-CEO,

05:27.728 --> 05:30.130
she knows she's sabotaging
her own company.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.299
Well, maybe she's got
it out of her system.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.368
Nah, not Cookie.
And if she want war,

05:34.402 --> 05:36.203
I'm gonna give it to her.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.571
All right,
I'll see you in a bit,

05:37.605 --> 05:39.072
I'm gonna hit the head.
Yeah.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.641
XAVIER:
I got Nessa booked for

05:40.674 --> 05:41.809
the XStream
Next Up Showcase.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.043
It'll be her
first solo set.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.379
I love it. Good stuff, X.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.480
Thank you.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.748
BECKY:
Good stuff?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.917
That makes zero sense.
Both Hakeem

05:49.950 --> 05:51.419
and Tiana
have albums dropping

05:51.452 --> 05:53.387
before Nessa.
Yeah, but I'm
your boss.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.490
Andre is mine,
so just do the math.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.559
HAKEEM:
Here's some math.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.894
I have as many voting shares
on the board as Andre.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.763
(laughs)

06:02.796 --> 06:04.565
ANDRE: Well, the board
is not involved

06:04.598 --> 06:07.100
in the day to day
of the company, Hakeem.

06:07.134 --> 06:10.904
Cookie wants Tiana,
so that's what she's gonna get.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.039
Pop.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.445
So...

06:17.478 --> 06:19.012
vote on the table is whether

06:19.046 --> 06:21.415
to feature Nessa or Tiana
at the showcase.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.417
Yo, are you hardheaded
or stupid?

06:23.451 --> 06:24.785
Mom already approved.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.186
Your mom approved who?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.688
Tiana.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.457
Then it's settled.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.126
It's Nessa
that gets the showcase.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.962
Dad, wait, you can't
be doing this.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.229
End of story.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.171
We're done here.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.944
Hey, Becky, listen.
You can save your sorrys,

06:50.978 --> 06:52.813
Xavier, I don't want them.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.450
No, you come at me in front
of the bosses like that again,

06:56.484 --> 06:58.151
I will fire you.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.155
How's that sorry for you?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.397
All right, so I'm-a hit you
when I land in Boston.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.799
You really have to go, huh?

07:11.832 --> 07:12.800
Yeah.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.235
I hope this Jayce plays ball.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.804
I mean, they got
all the files, right?

07:16.837 --> 07:17.971
Including the
citation from

07:18.005 --> 07:19.573
when they pulled me
over for that DUI.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.309
That alone doesn't place me
anywhere near that lake

07:22.342 --> 07:23.977
where Carla drowned.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.713
Carla.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.184
(scoffs) You know what?

07:31.218 --> 07:33.821
I couldn't even
remember her name

07:33.854 --> 07:36.323
till I saw it
in that file.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.826
I mean, I just met the girl
at that party that night.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.028
It was... (sighs)

07:41.061 --> 07:42.896
She seemed like
she was nice.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.166
And Jayce?

07:46.199 --> 07:48.502
Jayce, I didn't know him
that well, either.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.337
I mean, went to
grade school together.

07:50.370 --> 07:54.107
He ended up doing six years
for involuntary manslaughter.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.810
The arrest records
are sealed, but...

07:58.411 --> 08:00.347
...nobody from school
ever heard from him,

08:00.380 --> 08:02.282
so if I could
just get him

08:02.315 --> 08:04.818
to make a
statement, then...

08:06.386 --> 08:08.288
You know what,
don't worry about me.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.792
You got a lot on your
plate with Jamal.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.694
You see your boy
today, huh?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.228
You excited
to see Jamal?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.531
It's the first time
since I put him in rehab.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.999
That's right.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.070
I'm so scared, Angelo.
I just...

08:23.103 --> 08:26.540
I want my baby back,
healthy, sober and strong.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.741
I know.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.210
You will.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.647
Hey, just believe in him.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.882
All right?

08:34.915 --> 08:37.084
All right?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.888
Okay.
You look good.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.256
Thank you. (chuckles)

08:48.028 --> 08:49.730
Good afternoon.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.165
I'm Dr. Katz.
I'm Jamal's therapist.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.667
How's Jamal doing?

08:53.701 --> 08:55.168
We'll wait for him to tell you.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.104
Excuse me, do you have
a sound system in here?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.239
I want my brother to hear some
new stuff I've been working on.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.175
I'm afraid you'll have to wait
another three weeks until...

09:02.209 --> 09:05.579
TORY: Sunny Day Recovery Center
doesn't believe in music.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.348
Just one of the many stupid
rules at this dire refugee camp.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.183
Tory, this is a private
family session.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.752
Yo, Tory Ash.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.754
Yo, Hakeem Lyon.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.122
Oh, and Andre.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.592
And the mama bear Lyon herself.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.760
What's up, Cookie?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.361
Tory.
TORY: Relax, cornball.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.096
I'm just saying hello.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.865
From what Jamal's told me,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.000
I'm surprised all your little
Lyon cubs aren't in rehab.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.605
Don't try me, little girl,
not today.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.273
Please.
Oh, Cookie, I could try you,

09:33.306 --> 09:35.275
but I think I'd rather wait
and try Lucious instead.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.945
Oh, yeah, you should do that,
'cause you'll stay alive.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.681
I already told you
he's not coming.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.151
I see y'all met

09:44.184 --> 09:46.053
my crazy-ass friend, Tory.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.988
Good luck.
Thank you.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.290
Hey, Ma.
Jamal. (sighs)

09:50.323 --> 09:51.324
(chuckles)

09:53.426 --> 09:55.162
You look good. (chuckles)
Thanks, Mom.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.897
What's up, bro?
What's up, brother?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.565
(Cookie chuckles)

09:58.598 --> 09:59.566
What's up, Dre?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.968
Damn. Tory Ash.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.636
The whole world

10:02.670 --> 10:03.837
is still wondering
what happened to her

10:03.871 --> 10:05.238
ever since she stripped
butt naked

10:05.272 --> 10:06.807
onstage at Fenway Park.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.677
Show some respect, Hakeem.
The woman has an illness.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.812
Yeah, you would know a lot
about that, wouldn't you?
COOKIE: Shut up, boy.

10:11.845 --> 10:15.015
Yeah, she was a big star.
I mean, brilliant, too.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.017
Yeah.
That heroin knocked her ass
right out the sky.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.485
She had that meltdown
at Fenway.

10:18.518 --> 10:22.489
Didn't they find her in a coma
at some dingy motel?

10:22.522 --> 10:25.759
Mrs. Lyon, I have to ask you
not to indulge in gossip

10:25.793 --> 10:27.260
about other the residents.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.997
Sorry.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.364
Now, should we wait

10:31.398 --> 10:32.933
for Mr. Lyon, or...?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.668
Uh, like Jamal said,

10:34.702 --> 10:35.936
his father
ain't coming.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.037
LUCIOUS:
His father is what?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.540
How's my boy?
JAMAL: Dad.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.009
Look at you,

10:42.042 --> 10:44.377
all bright-eyed
and strong

10:44.411 --> 10:45.913
and ready for the world.

10:47.547 --> 10:51.685
How's my boy doing recovering
from those addictive drugs

10:51.719 --> 10:53.353
his mama got
him hooked on?

10:53.386 --> 10:56.256
Lucious, if you gonna be here,
can you be here for the family?

10:57.557 --> 11:00.360
That's rich,
coming from you.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.029
DR. KATZ:
I'm sure Jamal is happy

11:02.062 --> 11:03.563
that his whole family is here.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.800
Jamal,

11:06.834 --> 11:08.869
do you want to tell them
what's on your mind

11:08.902 --> 11:10.537
at the halfway point?
Sure.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.906
(clears throat)
Um, well...

11:14.607 --> 11:16.309
...first week was
absolute hell.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.079
I don't ever want to go
through withdrawal again.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.413
And we know you won't, bro.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.051
Yeah, if you stay clean.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.719
COOKIE: What do
you mean, "if"?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.755
He is clean.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.723
Right, Jamal?
Completely clean.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.391
You know, that's...

11:31.424 --> 11:33.026
that's why
I want to go home.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.562
What?
I need to go home.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.231
I got this...
this melody that's in my head.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.933
It's been pushing me the entire
time that I've been here,

11:39.967 --> 11:41.268
and I need to get
to the studio

11:41.301 --> 11:43.370
and I need to lay it down
before I lose it.

11:45.973 --> 11:49.009
So, your body is
healed, I get that,

11:49.042 --> 11:50.911
but you need to stay
and finish this program.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.180
Okay, Ma,
I need to finish the program.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.615
I also need to finish
the pills in the drain.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.687
I'm sorry, Ma,
that was messed up.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.122
That wasn't fair to you,
I'm sorry.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.328
I gave you those pills because
I saw you were in pain, Jamal.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.765
No, tell the truth.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.967
You gave him those pills
because you needed him

12:14.001 --> 12:15.969
to perform at that event.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.772
You also was conflicted
because you had to choose

12:18.806 --> 12:20.941
between the needs
of your boyfriend

12:20.974 --> 12:22.943
or the needs of your son.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.445
You don't know what
he did to Angelo.
What I did to Angelo...

12:25.478 --> 12:27.114
Mr. and Mrs. Lyon...
COOKIE:
Would you shut the hell up?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.648
LUCIOUS:
It's not half as bad as

12:28.681 --> 12:31.284
what you did to Empire
and to Empire's name.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.720
Jamal and I are sick and tired
of cleaning up the family name.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.455
LUCIOUS: It's a name you're not
even supposed to have

12:35.488 --> 12:37.290
in the first place.
Oh, right, cause you
built everything...

12:37.324 --> 12:39.392
First or last name.
You built everything...

12:39.426 --> 12:41.561
(Cookie and Lucious
continue arguing, voices fading)

12:41.594 --> 12:43.596
*

12:49.002 --> 12:49.970
THIRSTY:
Hey, what's up, papa.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.304
Let me get one of
them dirty dogs.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.841
They're Kosher, right?
Sí.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.809
There you go.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.177
Gracias.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.980
Ain't nothing like
a good pimp steak.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.250
Hand me a couple
napkins, will you?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.185
Thank you.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.000
LUCIOUS:
And you're sure

13:20.033 --> 13:22.836
it's about
Frank Gathers' murder?

13:22.870 --> 13:25.272
I mean, so says
Agent Sweetwater.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.274
And the way I figure it,

13:27.307 --> 13:29.509
somebody scored
a "get out of jail free" card.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.379
And Tariq got him lined up
to testify to a grand jury

13:32.412 --> 13:35.015
that you're the one
who ordered the hit on Gathers.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.683
I mean, so you
tell me, I mean,

13:36.716 --> 13:38.218
d-does anybody come to mind?

13:39.819 --> 13:43.290
Well, Guy, he's back at Lompoc.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.525
And Mikey caught a
bullet up in Jersey,

13:45.558 --> 13:48.228
so...

13:48.261 --> 13:49.796
that leaves

13:49.829 --> 13:53.133
one man, Bobby King,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.468
A.K.A. rat bastard.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.469
Bam-Bam.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.837
Bam-Bam.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.407
And to think I spent

14:00.440 --> 14:02.910
a bunch of money on
his daughter's leukemia bills,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.377
and she still died.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.913
I got the name.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.981
I'll find out
where Bam-Bam's hiding.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.549
Look, Thirst?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.718
You know, this
business about my mama

14:11.751 --> 14:14.922
and the press, you know...

14:14.955 --> 14:16.423
keep an eye on it.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.724
Yeah, it's not a problem.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.927
I'll keep her in my sights.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.763
Bam-Bam.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.936
SHINE: Looking good,
and they finally

14:28.969 --> 14:30.570
spelled my name right.
(chuckles)

14:30.603 --> 14:33.606
ANDRE: Looks like somebody's
moving up in the world.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.242
Congratulations, brother.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.610
Thanks.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.679
You hear about what
I hooked up for Nessa?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.915
Yeah, the, uh,
Next Up Showcase.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.083
It's good.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.118
She deserves it.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.587
Well, stepping
stones, my friend.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.356
Phase one
of the plan.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.192
(scoffs)
Speaking of the plan,

14:52.225 --> 14:54.261
you know...

14:54.294 --> 14:56.463
Inferno 'bout
to be a monster.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.266
Lucious is about to be
bigger than ever.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.469
There's no way you're stealing
Empire from him right now.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.976
I didn't say I was gonna
steal it from him.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.610
I said I'm gonna kill him.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.780
While Lucious is making
Inferno, we'll be making moves,

15:13.813 --> 15:15.815
mounting an army.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.217
An army?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.786
That's right.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.321
You mean my guys?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.823
I'd like to think of them
as our guys, Shine.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.158
(chuckles)

15:30.263 --> 15:32.099
Welcome to the Empire.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.240
I've got a statement
you can read explaining

15:40.273 --> 15:42.142
you were just protecting
the privacy of your mother.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.978
When have you ever known me
not to come off the dome?

15:45.012 --> 15:46.679
(reporters clamoring)

15:48.448 --> 15:50.650
I'm sure you got
a bunch of questions,

15:50.683 --> 15:52.485
so why don't we just
push to the punch?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.154
You want to ask about
my mother, right?

15:54.187 --> 15:55.655
REPORTER:
Yes, we do.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.324
Well, that's a very
private matter

15:57.357 --> 15:58.858
and it's being
handled privately.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.927
But what I do have
is a question for you.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.362
Who are you
voting for

16:02.395 --> 16:03.830
for mayor?

16:03.863 --> 16:06.366
Because I know
I'm endorsing John Meeks.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.668
(reporters murmur)
Don't you think it's time

16:08.701 --> 16:12.105
that New York had a mayor that
had the leadership qualities

16:12.139 --> 16:15.008
and the integrity of
someone like John Meeks?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.543
You see, he's
not a criminal,

16:16.576 --> 16:18.378
like Angelo Dubois.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.448
He would never leave a woman
to drown in a car

16:21.481 --> 16:24.051
because he was trying
to avoid a DUI.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.852
In fact, in honor
of that young woman

16:25.885 --> 16:27.520
who died
so many years ago,

16:27.554 --> 16:31.358
I'm going to offer a
$300,000 cash reward

16:31.391 --> 16:33.360
for anyone that has
any information

16:33.393 --> 16:38.298
that can lead to the conviction
of Mr. "Dubious" Dubois.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.733
(reporters clamoring)

16:40.767 --> 16:45.872
JAMAL: * Oh, this is
just a simple song *

16:45.905 --> 16:49.442
* About everything I've lost *

16:51.078 --> 16:54.347
* And everything
that I've found again *

16:56.116 --> 16:58.151
* Mm *

16:58.185 --> 17:00.653
* And why have I
been faking for *

17:00.687 --> 17:02.389
(humming harmony)
(chuckles)

17:02.422 --> 17:06.726
* When it seems to be so hard *

17:06.759 --> 17:10.897
* And broken *

17:10.930 --> 17:12.465
(hums melody)

17:14.434 --> 17:15.902
What are you working on?

17:15.935 --> 17:17.604
Oh, something that
was in my head.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.075
Yo, the acoustics here
are crazy, though.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.377
I know. It's kind of
amazing, right?

17:26.379 --> 17:28.515
(sighs)

17:28.548 --> 17:31.784
Before I came in here,
man, just...

17:31.818 --> 17:34.221
the music,
the passion, just...

17:36.789 --> 17:38.758
...couldn't
nobody catch me.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.927
And they couldn't
tell me nothing.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.463
I know, right?

17:43.496 --> 17:48.368
That fire, it's like
everything was high pressure.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.270
I felt like I was flying.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.872
(laughs) I felt like I could
propel myself off the Earth

17:52.905 --> 17:54.874
if I wanted to.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.444
Oh, God, I miss that so much.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.279
(softly):
Yeah.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.548
It's the best high in the world.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.649
Yeah.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.653
I can't lie, I miss it, too.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.090
Was always flying.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.994
So why don't we go get it?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.342
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to
the Next Up Showcase,

18:29.376 --> 18:32.912
featuring Empire's
hot new artist, Nessa Parker!

18:32.945 --> 18:34.981
* Getting right in here *

18:35.014 --> 18:37.150
* Getting right
in here *

18:37.184 --> 18:40.820
* Getting right in here,
getting right *

18:40.853 --> 18:42.922
* Long as the DJ keeps playing *

18:42.955 --> 18:45.592
* I'm dancing the whole night
away, aye *

18:45.625 --> 18:47.494
* 'Cause I got your attention *

18:47.527 --> 18:50.763
* And I'm keeping your eyes
on me, aye *

18:50.797 --> 18:53.366
* When the beat keep knocking,
drinks get to flowing *

18:53.400 --> 18:55.702
* You gon' like the way
my body going *

18:55.735 --> 18:57.003
* There ain't one
in this place... *

18:57.036 --> 18:58.771
Surprised to see you here.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.673
What, you want to
collect on that reward?

19:00.707 --> 19:03.510
You got some info for me
about Mr. Manslaughter?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.678
You're such a fame whore.
You got to keep Angelo's name

19:05.712 --> 19:07.380
on your mouth just
to stay relevant?

19:07.414 --> 19:11.551
Yeah, that's why it's my face
still on the logo in this place.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.885
* Get me right *

19:12.919 --> 19:14.621
HAKEEM: * You know
I'm-a get you right *

19:14.654 --> 19:16.623
* Get me right *
* You know I'm-a get you right *

19:16.656 --> 19:18.558
* Get me right *
* You know I'm-a
get you right *

19:18.591 --> 19:19.859
* We got all these drinks *

19:19.892 --> 19:21.194
* Yeah, yeah *

19:21.228 --> 19:22.729
TIANA:
* And all these lights *

19:22.762 --> 19:23.796
HAKEEM:
* Yeah, yeah *

19:23.830 --> 19:24.864
* So I hope you can *

19:24.897 --> 19:26.199
* Give this feeling... *

19:26.233 --> 19:28.235
SHINE:
Get Nessa's mic back on now!

19:28.268 --> 19:31.304
Don't. Nessa's a pro.
She can handle it.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.705
Man, get your hands off me.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.707
* We getting right,
getting right *

19:34.741 --> 19:36.876
* We getting
right, get me right *

19:36.909 --> 19:38.545
* We getting right,
get me right *

19:38.578 --> 19:40.747
* Shawty, you know
I'm-a get you right *

19:40.780 --> 19:42.549
* Got the baddest by my side,
when we step out *

19:42.582 --> 19:45.552
* It's a homicide,
killing 'em too easy, baby *

19:45.585 --> 19:48.321
* Got it on lock like
Weezy, baby, yeah *

19:48.355 --> 19:50.223
* We keep the situation
real live *

19:50.257 --> 19:51.891
* Haters, they don't
make us mad, nah *

19:51.924 --> 19:54.093
* Even if they still try,
we be on something *

19:54.126 --> 19:55.995
* They don't know about,
tell 'em they ain't with us *

19:56.028 --> 19:58.064
* We gon' throw em out,
touch your body *

19:58.097 --> 19:59.566
* In the party
when we tipsy... *

19:59.599 --> 20:01.568
Might want to start
making some plays

20:01.601 --> 20:03.236
out of a new playbook.

20:03.270 --> 20:06.072
All this is getting
very old and very boring.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.107
Tiana is a bigger star
than Nessa, boo-boo.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.610
You ought to be thanking me
for bringing more eyeballs

20:10.643 --> 20:13.246
to your wack-ass concert.
What'd you say?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.248
I got it lit in here.
Turn up your hearing aid.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.683
HAKEEM:
* You know we got it right, ah *

20:16.716 --> 20:19.185
* I can tell that you *

20:19.218 --> 20:20.753
* Really want me *

20:20.787 --> 20:23.690
* And I just need somebody *

20:23.723 --> 20:25.458
* To come and *

20:25.492 --> 20:28.027
* Get me right *
* We getting right *

20:28.060 --> 20:29.762
* Get me right *

20:29.796 --> 20:31.631
* We getting right,
get me right *

20:31.664 --> 20:33.099
* We getting right... *

20:33.132 --> 20:35.302
ANDRE: Her mic's back on.
Now watch this.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.036
* Get me right *
* Yeah, I'm the one *

20:37.069 --> 20:39.639
* Baby, I'm 'bout
to give you life *

20:40.673 --> 20:42.442
* Long as you keeping me *

20:42.475 --> 20:45.312
* Dancing in your spotlight *

20:45.345 --> 20:47.780
* 'Cause they can't
do it like me *

20:47.814 --> 20:50.116
* And they don't know why *

20:50.149 --> 20:51.818
* Can't even come close *

20:51.851 --> 20:54.287
* Even if they tried all night *

20:54.321 --> 20:56.155
* They better get right. *

20:56.188 --> 20:58.825
(music ends, crowd cheering)

21:00.760 --> 21:02.795
Yeah, to the Empire!
(crowd cheering)

21:02.829 --> 21:05.365
Yes, baby, yes!

21:07.534 --> 21:09.135
Bitch, you tried it.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.171
I'm a lady, so I'm not gonna
beat your ass this time.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.941
(crowd cheering)

21:17.009 --> 21:19.646
I should've beat your ass
for stealing that fashion show,

21:19.679 --> 21:21.448
you old dusty skank.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.485
(mic drops on stage)

21:25.518 --> 21:26.686
Bitch, who do
you think you...

21:26.719 --> 21:28.855
(Tiana grunts)
...talking to?!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.124
Nah, back up! Let them fight!

21:33.793 --> 21:35.161
SHINE:
That's what's up, yeah!

21:35.194 --> 21:36.162
Bitch!

21:36.195 --> 21:37.864
Uh-uh!
Look what you did.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.666
Now you got that
girl's ass beat

21:39.699 --> 21:41.434
in front of the whole world.
TIANA: You don't know me!

21:41.468 --> 21:43.269
SHINE:
Stay in your place!

21:43.302 --> 21:44.571
Bitch!

21:46.072 --> 21:47.674
Cheap-ass ho!

21:47.707 --> 21:49.842
What? What you gonna
do about it?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.210
Drag that bitch, Nessa!

21:53.212 --> 21:54.213
(phone ringing)

21:54.246 --> 21:55.515
Hello?
COOKIE:
Break this up!

21:55.548 --> 21:56.783
Shine! Hakeem!

21:56.816 --> 21:59.386
Nah, nah! Let them fight!
Let them fight!

22:01.087 --> 22:03.055
Wait, wait,
when did this happen?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.891
Come on, man, get out the way!
Beat your ass!

22:04.924 --> 22:05.892
Let me go!

22:05.925 --> 22:07.860
Well, they did
a bed check

22:07.894 --> 22:09.562
at the rehab.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.598
Jamal's not in his bed.

22:13.766 --> 22:14.867
Nessa! Nessa, calm down!

22:14.901 --> 22:16.903
Stop! Stop!
That's what's up!

22:16.936 --> 22:20.707
Let's go see D-Major
and his punk ass.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.575
We got to find him, Lucious.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.583
Yeah, man, you're a
genius, man. I want to add

22:30.617 --> 22:31.551
a little bit more bass.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.919
Hey, Lucious,

22:32.952 --> 22:34.554
I'm glad you're here.
I need your ear on this one.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.889
You know the thing--
What the hell?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.057
Get off me.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.493
Get... off...

22:40.527 --> 22:42.328
Where's my son, D?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.930
Your son is in rehab, Cookie.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.065
No, he left rehab, and I know

22:46.098 --> 22:48.000
you've been supplying him
with his drugs.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.737
If my son ends up O.D.'ing,
your ass is dead.

22:50.770 --> 22:51.771
What are you
talking about, Cookie?

22:51.804 --> 22:53.506
How you helping him
by giving him drugs?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.074
He's in pain, and you know that.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.577
I couldn't just stand there
and watch him suffer like that.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.912
So you give him drugs.
Man, I'm sick of this.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.748
Lucious, I wouldn't
do nothing, man, I swear.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.182
Cookie, I found
him! Look!

23:03.215 --> 23:05.785
Somebody posted a video on
Snapchat of him and Tory Ash.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.588
LUCIOUS:
They over in some

23:08.621 --> 23:10.623
dirty-ass neighborhood.
Or some crack house.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.525
Shut your ass up!

23:12.559 --> 23:13.960
I know where that is.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.462
Move!

23:21.468 --> 23:23.703
BECKY: Why is Mrs. Walker
in the backseat?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.605
THIRSTY: Lucious wants me
to keep an eye on her

23:25.638 --> 23:27.039
until I can find her
a babysitter.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.609
So explain to me again how,

23:29.642 --> 23:31.377
"Becky come on
this run with me,"

23:31.410 --> 23:33.813
is gonna translate
into you helping me out

23:33.846 --> 23:35.214
with that scumbag
Xavier?

23:35.247 --> 23:37.316
LEAH: I know how
to handle scumbags.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.452
All right, take it easy,
Granny Gru. We know you do.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.621
Thirsty, what are we doing?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.289
We're just doing a favor for
a friend of Lucious. Sit tight.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.825
She coming in here?

23:45.858 --> 23:48.327
Becky, please, be nice.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.629
BECKY:
Mm-mm.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.897
Is that your friend?

23:50.930 --> 23:51.964
I don't know her.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.466
THIRSTY:
Here you go, man.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.001
Good looking out.
Thank you, sir.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.838
How you doing, Miss Gretchen?

23:58.871 --> 24:00.907
Oh, I can hardly wait
to see my Bam-Bam.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.308
He's such a good son.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.911
He's moving me
to a nursing home in Arizona.

24:04.944 --> 24:05.912
That's good.
Oh, he's a good boy.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.480
All right.
(chuckles)

24:07.514 --> 24:09.482
My Dwight had me locked up
in one of those homes

24:09.516 --> 24:11.851
for over a hundred years.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.820
Those places are evil.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.187
THIRSTY:
Okay, okay...

24:15.221 --> 24:16.523
BECKY: I know damn
well you ain't got me

24:16.556 --> 24:19.692
out here helping you kidnap
these old ladies.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.594
I am not doing a bid for this.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.029
No, she just kidding,
Gran. Just relax.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.764
Do I look like a
kidnapper to you?

24:24.797 --> 24:27.166
Yes.
I'm a lawyer, thank you
very much. All right?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.168
And I'm trying
to instruct you on the virtues

24:29.201 --> 24:31.337
of the perfectly-timed
execution.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.673
For that, you need patience,
Grasshopper.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.341
THIRSTY: All right,
buckle up, golden girls.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.209
You good back there?
You need the heat on?

24:37.243 --> 24:38.611
LEAH:
Watch the road!

24:38.645 --> 24:40.613
*

24:40.647 --> 24:45.017
* Oh, this is just
a simple song *

24:45.051 --> 24:49.856
* About everything I've lost *

24:49.889 --> 24:54.126
* And everything
that I've found again *

24:54.160 --> 24:56.796
* Mm, uh... *

24:56.829 --> 24:57.964
Where's Jamal, Tyree?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.465
Jamal? I ain't seen him.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.900
Look, you don't want
no trouble with me tonight.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.302
I will tear
this raggedy-ass studio down.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.737
(Lucious sighs)

25:04.771 --> 25:06.205
And whatever
she doesn't destroy, I will.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.975
What's up, Lucious?
What's up?! Answer
the question!

25:09.008 --> 25:10.042
Hey, hey, hey!

25:10.076 --> 25:11.644
Yeah, this ain't a joke.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.645
He's upstairs, studio one.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.713
* And why *

25:13.746 --> 25:16.549
* Have I been faking for *

25:16.583 --> 25:20.219
* When's hard enough to be *

25:20.252 --> 25:22.054
* In this world *

25:22.088 --> 25:24.557
* Who we truly are *

25:24.591 --> 25:26.959
* Truly are *

25:28.761 --> 25:31.497
* I was so used
to living wrong *

25:31.530 --> 25:36.402
* But now I know
we need nothing *

25:36.435 --> 25:39.872
* Except a simple song *

25:41.307 --> 25:43.676
* Mm *

25:43.710 --> 25:46.178
* See, I *

25:46.212 --> 25:49.115
* Done hid for years, y'all *

25:49.148 --> 25:51.618
* Yeah *

25:51.651 --> 25:55.354
* But I'm so done hiding *

25:55.387 --> 25:58.090
* Now *

25:58.124 --> 26:01.427
* And if I were you *

26:01.460 --> 26:05.464
* I would find the time
to find myself *

26:07.634 --> 26:11.137
* 'Cause you don't know
what life will do *

26:11.170 --> 26:14.440
* What life will do *

26:14.473 --> 26:18.611
* Oh, but this is still
a simple song *

26:18.645 --> 26:22.281
* Of how hard
this life could be *

26:22.314 --> 26:24.951
* When you have nothing *

26:24.984 --> 26:26.953
* That you're living for *

26:26.986 --> 26:30.356
* Living for *

26:31.824 --> 26:33.492
* You can sing... *
(music stops)

26:33.525 --> 26:35.561
What you doing, Jamal?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.996
LUCIOUS: Your mother
almost had a heart attack

26:37.029 --> 26:38.464
looking for you.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.166
What y'all think?
I'm recording a song.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.635
Look, I'm-a have Webb
run through this whole place.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.503
We find one speck of drugs...

26:44.536 --> 26:45.805
COOKIE: That's right.
Oh, my God.

26:45.838 --> 26:46.973
Dad, I said

26:47.006 --> 26:49.075
that I am sober and clean,
and I am.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.309
Then why did you
leave rehab?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.410
Listen, what needs
to happen right now

26:51.443 --> 26:52.679
is we need to
finish this song,

26:52.712 --> 26:53.680
so y'all need to just...
(whistles)

26:53.713 --> 26:55.815
What you need to do is shut up.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.416
JAMAL:
Oh, Lord...
Bitch!

26:57.449 --> 26:59.018
You know what-- Ma, Ma!
What you need

26:59.051 --> 27:00.319
is your ass beat!
Mom, please.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.654
You don't want none of this.
Please, please. No.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.022
Yeah.
She don't.
She really don't.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.491
Why do have to go to DEFCON...
Please, stop. Ma, Dad!

27:05.524 --> 27:07.359
Mom, stop.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.529
Where I'm supposed to be

27:10.562 --> 27:12.765
and doing what I'm supposed
to be doing is right here.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.500
This is my rehab.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.068
Come on.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.039
Okay, finish your song.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.675
Thank you, Dad.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.177
I'm sorry. Come on.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.880
You can trust me, Ma. Come on.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.850
LUCIOUS:
Come on, Cook.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.986
I'll be out here to take you
home when you're done.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.158
LUCIOUS:
Sorry, y'all.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.235
*

27:53.572 --> 27:55.074
Order up.
(bell dings)

27:57.409 --> 27:59.045
* Cruisin'... *

27:59.078 --> 28:00.246
Mama?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.750
Mama!

28:06.285 --> 28:08.520
Hey, Bam,
don't leave just yet.

28:10.589 --> 28:13.225
* Baby, let's cruise... *

28:13.259 --> 28:15.928
L, man, let me explain.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.229
No, you don't speak.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.931
I speak.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.669
* Don't be confused *

28:23.702 --> 28:26.238
* The way *

28:26.272 --> 28:31.243
* Is clear *

28:31.277 --> 28:35.614
* And if you want it,
you got it forever... *

28:35.647 --> 28:39.351
You see, I understand
how things happen, Bam.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.588
Me and the Feds both know that
every man has his weakness.

28:42.621 --> 28:46.258
And in your case,
it's that sweet,

28:46.292 --> 28:49.762
loving woman out
there that raised you

28:49.796 --> 28:53.465
and then raised your little
girl when you got locked up.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.136
But when you and I
were locked up,

28:57.169 --> 29:00.807
I made a promise
to take care of them.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.776
And I did everything I could
to help your little girl,

29:03.810 --> 29:05.978
but now that she's gone...

29:08.480 --> 29:11.317
...I still kept my word
and took care your mama.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.886
The same way you're gonna
remember your P's and Q's

29:13.920 --> 29:16.488
when you get in front
of that grand jury.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.160
All right.
Here you go.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.636
We got Bam-Bam's mother home
safe and sound.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.973
Granny Gru has gone
night-night, thank God.

29:34.006 --> 29:37.176
And I just dropped off
the care package at WZVX.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.846
Check, check and check.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.181
What, am I
forgetting something?

29:42.214 --> 29:43.315
You forgetting me.

29:43.349 --> 29:44.516
Are you ser...

29:44.550 --> 29:47.019
You got me driving
all over Jersey

29:47.053 --> 29:48.187
on these dumbass errands.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.322
When are we gonna talk
about my problems though?

29:50.356 --> 29:52.424
All right, you know what?
Explain it to me, Hot Pocket.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.526
Why are you still stressing out
over that cornball Xavier?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.162
Yo, you don't get it.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.498
Ever since he got to Empire,
he's been all up in my face

29:59.531 --> 30:01.167
and doing shady stuff,
talking about,

30:01.200 --> 30:04.170
(mocking): "Oh, oh, it's just
business, it's just business."

30:04.203 --> 30:05.771
But acting like
it's personal with me.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.106
There you go. Lesson one.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.108
It's business, of course.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.344
But no matter what anybody
tells you, it's always personal.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.213
Okay, so what I do?

30:14.246 --> 30:17.549
You know what,
what more can you do?

30:17.583 --> 30:19.618
Yo.
(chuckles)

30:19.651 --> 30:21.387
All right, relax, mama.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.355
That's not for you.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.557
Just let the universe
work its magic.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.026
Okay?

30:27.059 --> 30:28.227
It's got you.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.229
Type of Shaolin monk bull...

30:30.262 --> 30:33.132
You know what?
You have wasted my entire day.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.800
(Thirsty humming koto music)

30:34.833 --> 30:36.035
BECKY:
Waste of time.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.736
THIRSTY:
Shaolin Wu-Tang.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.041
ROSS:
So Lucious Lyon wins again.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.043
You built this case up
on one star witness,

30:44.076 --> 30:46.378
Bam-Bam King, who suddenly
refuses to testify.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.713
Yeah, Lyon must've
got to him somehow.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.581
He murdered Frank Gathers,
and I can prove it.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.883
I just need more time.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.384
Agent, your time is up;
as of right now,

30:52.418 --> 30:53.986
you're off the case,
'cause it's closed.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.988
What?
But I have more leads, sir.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.057
Any evidence
against the target is tainted

30:58.090 --> 30:59.725
due to your omission of the fact

30:59.758 --> 31:02.061
that he is your
half-brother.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.463
I'm putting you on paid leave.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.107
REPORTER: Mr. Dubois' campaign
got a much needed

31:15.141 --> 31:16.608
breath of life when Jayce Jones

31:16.642 --> 31:18.677
came forward to confirm that
he served time

31:18.710 --> 31:20.913
for the manslaughter death
of Carla Mills,

31:20.947 --> 31:23.515
who drowned in a lake
over 20 years ago.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.251
And most important,
that Angelo Dubois

31:25.284 --> 31:27.253
was nowhere near the scene
when it happened.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.021
(mutes TV)

31:29.055 --> 31:30.422
God.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.191
Dad went so low.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.526
Are you surprised?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.495
Always and never.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.765
What?

31:39.798 --> 31:41.500
(sighs)

31:42.801 --> 31:46.105
I'm gonna keep this short...

31:46.138 --> 31:47.473
and real.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.977
Are you a dope fiend?

31:56.748 --> 31:57.916
(sighs)

31:59.651 --> 32:02.288
Look, I got caught up, Ma.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.991
I ain't even trying
to run away from that.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.893
But I swear on my music
and everything else

32:07.926 --> 32:09.996
that I've been fighting back for
since I came back

32:10.029 --> 32:13.565
from the bullet, I...
I'm done with the pills.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.467
Really.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.969
I'm so focused.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.804
I'm not even trying to have
any kind of substance

32:18.837 --> 32:19.838
mess with that.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.977
I'm happy to hear that, baby.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.145
(chuckles)

32:26.178 --> 32:29.481
(sighs)

32:29.515 --> 32:32.351
Finally feels like
everything's gonna be all right.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.520
You're okay.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.423
Angelo's situation
is settled.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.358
He's back on
his campaign, so...

32:39.391 --> 32:41.260
Yeah, he's good, right?

32:41.293 --> 32:42.528
We'll see.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.031
I mean, it's politics;
all they got to do is say it,

32:45.064 --> 32:47.366
it sticks to you like stink.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.304
Lucious did all of
that just for you.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.843
That is a twisted
kind of love, man.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.911
I know he's planning
his next move.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.490
*

33:20.099 --> 33:22.634
LUCIOUS:
Now, before we get started,

33:22.668 --> 33:25.404
let's take care
of a short order of business.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.805
Xavier.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.540
You're fired.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.642
GUARD:
All right, let's go.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.411
Whoa, come on, man!
What the hell?

33:32.444 --> 33:35.047
Let this serve as an example
for each and every one of you.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.149
If I catch anybody
getting kickbacks,

33:37.183 --> 33:39.718
trust me, the next time
you'll get much more

33:39.751 --> 33:41.220
than fired.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.421
XAVIER:
Mr. Lyon, Mr. Lyon,

33:42.454 --> 33:43.555
I would never
do that to you, man.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.590
I swear to God,
I'm innocent on this!

33:44.623 --> 33:45.591
Innocent?

33:45.624 --> 33:46.992
Tell that
to the program director

33:47.025 --> 33:48.927
over at WZVX.

33:48.960 --> 33:49.995
You run a sloppy
business, man, sloppy.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.064
Come on, now,
that's a lie! Becky!

33:52.098 --> 33:53.899
Becky, you know me.
All right? You know me.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.667
You need to vouch for me.
Come on.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.670
I don't know you, man.
It's just business.

33:58.704 --> 33:59.738
"Just business"?

33:59.771 --> 34:00.772
Bye.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.741
Yo, I'm innocent, man!

34:02.774 --> 34:04.243
Yo, I didn't do this!

34:04.276 --> 34:06.912
Get off me!

34:06.945 --> 34:08.180
Go on out of here.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.781
Now that the fireworks are over,

34:09.815 --> 34:11.750
I'm sure you've all
heard my announcement

34:11.783 --> 34:16.255
about Inferno, even though it
may have been muffled a bit by

34:16.288 --> 34:17.756
certain people
in this room.
Uh, Lucious, look,

34:17.789 --> 34:19.091
everyone in this room

34:19.125 --> 34:20.759
is very busy,
so if you could go ahead,

34:20.792 --> 34:22.928
and finish what
you have to say, thank you.

34:22.961 --> 34:24.130
I'm getting there.

34:27.133 --> 34:30.436
We are Lyons;
therefore, we roar.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.971
So from this point forward,
each and every employee

34:33.004 --> 34:35.441
of this company,
their number one priority

34:35.474 --> 34:37.109
is to make sure that

34:37.143 --> 34:39.445
Inferno is what it should be.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.147
It's an album

34:41.180 --> 34:42.614
I'm producing.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.617
I'm going to have the
top artists from Empire on it,

34:45.651 --> 34:47.486
and I'm hoping
that my son, Jamal,

34:47.519 --> 34:50.322
will bless me
with a song.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.624
Now, seeing that the position
of head of A&R

34:52.658 --> 34:53.792
has recently just opened,

34:53.825 --> 34:56.728
I decided to fill it
with someone that I feel is

34:56.762 --> 34:59.965
worthy of such a position.

34:59.998 --> 35:03.169
And as a result of being
in this position,

35:03.202 --> 35:06.638
she's come to be under
a great deal of anguish and fire

35:06.672 --> 35:07.973
from me because she's been

35:08.006 --> 35:11.076
my biggest critic,
which in turn turned her

35:11.109 --> 35:15.314
into my greatest ally,
and she's very loyal.

35:15.347 --> 35:19.151
And I was so hesitant
to appoint her in this position

35:19.185 --> 35:20.819
because I didn't want
to take her away

35:20.852 --> 35:22.588
from her first
responsibility,

35:22.621 --> 35:25.991
and that's the job
of being a mother.

35:26.024 --> 35:29.328
But she will serve me
as she has for years,

35:29.361 --> 35:32.097
as my muse who has lit

35:32.130 --> 35:34.333
an inferno inside of me.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.502
She is the DNA
of this company,

35:36.535 --> 35:40.706
my wife, Mrs. Anika Lyon.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.140
(chuckles)

35:44.743 --> 35:46.111
Your new head of A&R.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.145
Thank you.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.716
Thank you.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.424
Congrats.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.232
Come on.
Take your seat.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.999
Ha! Nice and warm for you.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.449
("Inferno" playing)

36:26.585 --> 36:29.255
("Inferno" continues
over speakers)

36:31.690 --> 36:34.025
(door opens, slams)

36:36.628 --> 36:41.733
Mm, mm-mm, that
is fire, Lucious.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.835
Yeah, "Inferno." (chuckles)

36:43.869 --> 36:45.404
The name fits.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.606
What, you want
some trouble, Cookie?

36:47.639 --> 36:51.943
No, no, I-I don't want
no trouble, Lucious.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.713
I just have
some questions, is all.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.618
Like, this-this
album right here.

36:59.651 --> 37:03.589
This was your first
album to go gold.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.858
Now, I remember working
on that six months

37:06.892 --> 37:10.028
before I went to prison.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.632
So, whose DNA is in that,
Lucious? Huh?

37:16.735 --> 37:18.637
(laughs)

37:18.670 --> 37:20.806
DNA. Boy, please.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.312
Ain't nothing but a hood rat.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.347
(glass shatters)

37:31.149 --> 37:33.652
(glass shatters)

37:33.685 --> 37:36.455
All right.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.989
Let's play.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.298
Did I tell you,

37:46.332 --> 37:48.467
I watched you on TV

37:48.500 --> 37:50.802
in that dirty-ass rec room

37:50.836 --> 37:56.074
in Danbury when Empire's
first album was inducted

37:56.107 --> 37:58.644
into the Music Hall of Fame.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.146
(glass shatters)

38:01.179 --> 38:03.014
(chuckles)

38:03.048 --> 38:04.683
Who was your muse for that?

38:04.716 --> 38:05.851
You done, bitch?

38:05.884 --> 38:06.985
Huh, Lucious?

38:07.018 --> 38:08.153
Don't you come any closer.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.322
Put it down.
(grunts)

38:10.356 --> 38:13.024
Who was your muse
on that, huh?!

38:13.058 --> 38:15.327
Who was your muse, Lucious?

38:15.361 --> 38:18.029
Oh, do you remember this one?

38:18.063 --> 38:19.331
Because I do.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.600
Yeah, I sent tapes
from the inside

38:21.633 --> 38:25.203
back and forth with you while
you worked on them out here.

38:26.204 --> 38:28.206
(laughs)

38:28.239 --> 38:30.676
Oh! And this one.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.211
This is when you stopped
coming to visit me.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.013
It was weak.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.715
All the critics said so.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.220
Yeah, get up.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.890
None of this would've
existed without me!

38:44.923 --> 38:46.625
Not those gold records!

38:46.658 --> 38:48.193
Not those plaques!

38:48.226 --> 38:50.028
Not this studio!

38:50.061 --> 38:51.963
None of it!

38:51.997 --> 38:54.232
So you tell me, Lucious.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.369
Tell me whose DNA is running
all through it, huh?

38:57.403 --> 39:01.239
Who's the mother with
the important job, Lucious?!

39:01.272 --> 39:02.240
You tell me.

39:02.273 --> 39:03.409
I gave you three sons,

39:03.442 --> 39:06.044
bitch, three sons!

39:06.077 --> 39:07.746
I had a miscarriage.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.917
I went to jail for 17 years

39:11.950 --> 39:13.251
so you could build this!

39:14.920 --> 39:15.987
So you could build this Empire!

39:16.021 --> 39:17.456
(shouts)

39:18.924 --> 39:19.925
(shouts)

39:19.958 --> 39:21.226
COOKIE:
Yeah, follow me!

39:21.259 --> 39:23.495
I'll show you whose DNA
is in here.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.431
Okay, now you die!

39:25.464 --> 39:28.734
You said Lyons roar?
Well, let me hear you roar.

39:28.767 --> 39:29.901
Yeah, I came here

39:29.935 --> 39:31.537
to make a lot of noise.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.273
Now you die!

39:36.442 --> 39:37.809
Go home.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.482
COOKIE:
I'm just getting started.
(elevator bell dings)

39:56.962 --> 40:00.466
(piano keys pounding)

40:05.303 --> 40:07.739
(grunting)

40:27.993 --> 40:31.129
Trying to erase me, Lucious?

40:31.162 --> 40:32.698
Huh?

40:36.868 --> 40:38.837
After all
I done for you.

40:38.870 --> 40:43.141
(crying):
I did 17 years for this family.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.343
You built this company
on my back.

40:47.713 --> 40:50.081
(crying)

40:50.115 --> 40:52.484
And you just gonna give it
to that bitch.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.185
Is that your plan, Lucious?

40:54.219 --> 40:56.855
Huh?!

40:56.888 --> 40:58.524
(shouts)

40:58.557 --> 40:59.758
Let go of me!

40:59.791 --> 41:01.693
Stop.
(grunting)

41:05.697 --> 41:07.699
(panting)

41:34.259 --> 41:36.261
(teapot whistling)

41:41.399 --> 41:43.902
(whistling stops)

41:53.912 --> 41:56.181

42:13.799 --> 42:16.602

42:22.473 --> 42:24.943
(moaning)

42:43.829 --> 42:45.764
Mm-mm.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.599
No.

42:47.633 --> 42:51.269
I said I was done with you.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.338
I meant that.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.344
*

44:00.371 --> 44:01.372
Yeah.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.978
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.748
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.218
(gunshot)

44:13.251 --> 44:15.520
Shots Fired is
a murder mystery.

44:15.553 --> 44:18.356
An African-American officer
kills an unarmed white guy.

44:18.389 --> 44:21.126
I asked him
to step out of the vehicle,
but as he steps out,

44:21.159 --> 44:23.361
he reaches for my gun,
and it was either him or me.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.863
-And I shot him.
-Four times.

44:26.397 --> 44:28.967
WOMAN: Preston and Ashe are
a prosecutor and an investigator

44:29.000 --> 44:30.736
come down to investigate.

44:30.769 --> 44:33.839
They uncover a second teenager
that was killed-- a black teen.

44:33.872 --> 44:37.375
Suddenly, there's these two
racially charged shootings
they're investigating.

44:37.408 --> 44:40.245
I play Ashe Akino.
She has lots of layers.

44:40.278 --> 44:42.380
She is not perfect.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.415
Sometimes she will do
whatever it takes

44:44.449 --> 44:46.584
to get what she wants
in a case.

44:46.617 --> 44:49.988
Preston's a graduate
from Harvard, working for
the Department of Justice.

44:50.021 --> 44:53.925
As the series progresses,
his idealism will be tested.

44:53.959 --> 44:56.694
All I care about is the truth,
and my truth has no color.

44:56.728 --> 44:59.264
A tragedy has come
to Gate Station,

44:59.297 --> 45:01.566
and when there are questions,
I want answers.

45:01.599 --> 45:04.502
Our mantra for the show
is get the audience
at the edge of their seat,

45:04.535 --> 45:06.304
and when they're
leaning forward,
hit 'em with the truth.
