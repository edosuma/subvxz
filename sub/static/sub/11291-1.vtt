01:47.641 --> 01:49.042
Say...

01:49.142 --> 01:52.645
"Oo, oo, oo, butin."

01:54.147 --> 01:57.400
Oo, oo, oo, butin.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.971
No.

02:01.071 --> 02:04.907
Put your mouths
as if you were about to whistle.

02:06.993 --> 02:08.937
But don't do it.

02:09.037 --> 02:10.454
Say...

02:11.206 --> 02:14.959
"Oo, oo, oo, butin."

02:16.712 --> 02:20.089
Oo, oo, oo, butin.

02:23.218 --> 02:30.182
Mrs Hemans, is there one pupil who is in
any way proficient in the French language?

02:31.017 --> 02:33.629
Chris Guthrie is one of my best...

02:33.729 --> 02:35.604
especially in Latin.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.733
Let her stand up.

02:45.449 --> 02:47.142
Say...

02:47.242 --> 02:50.786
"Oo, oo, oo, butin."

02:52.748 --> 02:56.041
Oo, oo, oo, butin.

02:56.668 --> 02:58.153
Oh.

02:58.253 --> 03:00.546
I hope your Latin is as good.

03:09.431 --> 03:11.375
Is your father really a socialist?

03:11.475 --> 03:12.501
Yeah.

03:12.601 --> 03:14.544
Chae says that all should be equal...

03:14.644 --> 03:16.645
rich and poor, men and women.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.633
He wants me to learn
so I'll be ready for the revolution.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.343
And if it doesn't come?

03:21.443 --> 03:25.806
Well, I'll train to be a doctor
and cut the bodies of the paupers.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.809
You better take care
you don't die a pauper, Chris.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.478
I'd hate to be standing there
with the scalpel in my hand

03:31.578 --> 03:34.747
and looking into your queer dead face
and crying,

03:35.415 --> 03:38.026
"But this is Chris Guthrie!"

03:38.126 --> 03:40.070
Marget Strachan!

03:48.094 --> 03:49.830
Oh, but Aberdeen?

03:49.930 --> 03:55.001
Well, it's the best place for a scholar
and I'll be trained all the sooner.

03:58.980 --> 04:02.942
Oh, Chrissie, Chrissie,
only fools love being alive!

04:06.071 --> 04:09.949
Men, women... what fools
they are below their clothes.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.993
There are lovely things in the world...

04:13.620 --> 04:17.331
lovely that don't endure,
and the lovelier for that.

04:18.124 --> 04:21.709
Wait till you find yourself in the arms
of your lad at the harvest time.

04:22.254 --> 04:25.157
He'll stop joking,
and he'll take you like this.

04:25.257 --> 04:30.370
There's not a body to see us! And hold you
like this, with his hands held so,

04:30.470 --> 04:32.414
and kiss you like this.

04:32.514 --> 04:34.707
Mwah!

04:37.394 --> 04:39.421
"And when the First Reformation came,

04:39.521 --> 04:41.339
some folk cried, 'Whiggam, '

04:41.439 --> 04:43.258
and some cried, 'Rome, '

04:43.358 --> 04:45.025
and some cried, 'The King.'

04:45.569 --> 04:50.114
Then Dutch William came and
the Kinraddies were all for the Covenant.

04:50.866 --> 04:54.269
But then it was an ill time
for the Scottish gentry,

04:54.369 --> 04:57.564
for the poison of the French Revolution
came over the seas

04:57.664 --> 05:01.041
and the new Laird of Kinraddie
became a Jacobin

05:01.626 --> 05:04.829
and joined the Jacobin Club in Aberdeen."

05:05.547 --> 05:07.798
Oh, there's no land like Aberdeen.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.719
Or folks so fine that bide there.

05:13.305 --> 05:17.808
Oh, Chris, my lass, there's more to life
than your books or studies.

05:19.227 --> 05:21.546
There's the countryside your own...

05:21.646 --> 05:23.790
you, its.

05:25.191 --> 05:28.720
In the days when you're neither
bairn nor woman.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.821
Peace, Jean, peace.

05:31.573 --> 05:33.642
She'll do us credit.

05:33.742 --> 05:35.743
Go on, Chris, read us more.

05:38.330 --> 05:42.416
"And there at Aberdeen, he was
nearly killed in rioting for liberty,

05:43.209 --> 05:45.278
and equality and fraternity."

05:45.378 --> 05:47.379
Equality should begin at home.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.775
Yes, she sat for her bursary...

06:09.319 --> 06:10.887
and got it.

06:10.987 --> 06:13.280
But two Chrisses there were...

06:13.990 --> 06:15.991
that fought for her heart.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.871
She hated the land
and the coarse speak of the folk.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.500
And learning was brave and fine one day,

06:25.377 --> 06:27.320
and the next she'd waken,

06:27.420 --> 06:30.339
with the peewits crying
across the hills...

06:31.299 --> 06:33.243
deep and deep,

06:33.343 --> 06:35.344
crying in the heart of her.

06:37.013 --> 06:41.308
And the smell of the earth in her face
almost made her cry...

06:42.602 --> 06:47.564
for the beauty of it and the sweetness
of the Scottish land and skies.

06:57.033 --> 07:01.578
And the next minute that passed from her
and she was English,

07:03.206 --> 07:08.043
back to the English words,
so sharp and clean and true.

07:09.921 --> 07:14.925
For a while, for a while, till they slid
so smoothly from her throat.

07:16.428 --> 07:20.931
She knew that they could never say
anything worth the saying at all.

07:35.071 --> 07:37.140
Amo, amas.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.283
I love a lass.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.815
Clever enough to be a teacher.

07:45.915 --> 07:47.233
Aye.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.334
Clever enough.

07:52.797 --> 07:54.699
Move over...

07:54.799 --> 07:56.216
Jehovah.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.988
If I ever hear you take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain again,

08:19.240 --> 08:21.184
I'll libb you.

08:21.284 --> 08:23.285
I'll libb you like a lamb.

08:27.248 --> 08:28.874
I hate him.

08:30.668 --> 08:32.669
Oh, Will.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.912
I hate him.

08:41.011 --> 08:42.205
Jean.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.640
Four in a family's fine.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.168
Fine?

08:47.268 --> 08:49.212
There'll be no more.

08:49.312 --> 08:52.257
We'll have what God in his mercy
sends to us, woman.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.358
See you to that!

09:04.661 --> 09:06.662
I hate him.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.400
It was her hair.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.444
Her bonny, bonny hair.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.197
Man, it's a fair tough case!

09:16.297 --> 09:18.116
I'll need your help!

09:18.216 --> 09:20.827
You, get the doctor
an egg for his breakfast now.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.871
Guthrie, man, do you hear me?

09:22.971 --> 09:24.497
I'm not deaf!

09:35.817 --> 09:37.818
She's far too old for that.

09:40.196 --> 09:42.322
She shouldnae be having another baby.

09:44.576 --> 09:46.144
It's him.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.188
It's the beast.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.792
But don't worry.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.545
His friend Jehovah will see to it all.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.621
Hot water, jugs of it.

10:04.721 --> 10:08.249
Pour me a basin of water, Chris,
and put plenty of soap nearby it.

10:10.549 --> 10:13.671
- Do you hear me?
- Aye, Doctor! Only, she's feared.

10:13.771 --> 10:17.759
She'll have a damned sight more to fear
when she's having a bairn of her own!

10:17.859 --> 10:19.860
Pour out that water, quick!

10:51.267 --> 10:52.752
It's twins.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.486
We'll need more rooms.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.240
More rooms?

11:07.450 --> 11:09.451
Are we joining the gentry, Jean?

11:11.537 --> 11:13.080
Well...

11:14.082 --> 11:15.999
we're to bide here, then?

11:17.085 --> 11:19.086
Content yourself.

11:19.754 --> 11:21.755
I'll find a place.

11:23.383 --> 11:30.430
<i>I am a poor wayfaring stranger</i>

11:31.849 --> 11:39.398
<i>A-wandering through this world of woe</i>

11:40.525 --> 11:48.740
<i>And there's no sickness, toil or danger</i>

11:49.659 --> 11:57.791
<i>In that great world to which I go</i>

11:58.751 --> 12:05.924
- <i>I'm going home to see my father</i>
- John, stop!

12:06.843 --> 12:08.593
Halt!

12:14.392 --> 12:15.835
Get down, you brat!

12:15.935 --> 12:19.797
We'd better loosen up at Portlethen
and not try the slug this night.

12:19.897 --> 12:22.300
Damn it to hell, woman,
you think I'm made of silver?

12:22.400 --> 12:26.429
I know we're not made of silver,
but we might all die of the night.

12:27.322 --> 12:34.661
<i>I'm only going over home</i>

12:58.269 --> 13:00.771
So that was how she came to Blawearie...

13:02.690 --> 13:04.691
Oh, Kinraddie.

13:07.278 --> 13:14.659
<i>I'm going home to meet my mother</i>

13:15.453 --> 13:24.878
<i>She said she'd meet me when I come</i>

13:26.005 --> 13:35.347
<i>I'm only going over Jordan</i>

13:37.225 --> 13:46.942
<i>I'm only going over home</i>

13:56.994 --> 13:58.995
God, you've stripped!

14:00.289 --> 14:02.703
You'd make a fine lad, Chris.

14:06.087 --> 14:08.614
Get out of there at once,
you shameful limmer!

14:08.714 --> 14:10.325
Get your clothes on!

14:10.425 --> 14:13.036
What can folks say if they see her
out here near naked?

14:13.136 --> 14:14.996
If your neighbours haven't seen
a naked lass,

14:15.096 --> 14:18.265
they must have fathered their own bairns
with their breeks on.

14:26.858 --> 14:30.053
What's this I'm hearing about you
and some bitch from Drumlithie?

14:30.153 --> 14:32.625
Aye, she's not a virgin either!

14:54.010 --> 14:55.552
Right.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.430
I'm off to the mart at Laurencekirk.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.164
No other soul must handle the gun
but Father.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.042
Aye.

16:25.142 --> 16:27.143
You and your guns.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.855
What harm was in Will that he used it?

16:37.655 --> 16:39.656
You'll come out to the barn with me.

16:43.452 --> 16:45.704
- Father, you can't.
- Hold your tongue.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.708
Or I'll be taking you out as well.

19:38.836 --> 19:41.171
There are lovely things in the world.

19:43.841 --> 19:45.842
Lovely that do not endure...

19:49.305 --> 19:51.306
and are lovelier for that.

20:07.198 --> 20:10.867
Well, you'll be my neighbour,
Guthrie, man.

20:11.994 --> 20:13.437
Aye.

20:13.537 --> 20:15.872
And you'll be the new minister, Mr Gibbon.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.694
You've a fine-kept farm, Mr Guthrie.

20:19.794 --> 20:21.737
Trig and trim,

20:21.837 --> 20:24.506
though I hear you've sat down
a bare six months.

20:25.466 --> 20:26.784
Oh.

20:26.884 --> 20:28.577
- My daughter, Chris.
- Ah.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.538
I hear you're right clever, Chrissie,

20:30.638 --> 20:32.707
and go to Duncairn College.
How do you like it?

20:32.807 --> 20:33.958
Fine, sir.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.626
And what are you to be?

20:35.726 --> 20:37.727
A teacher, sir.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.814
There's no profession more honourable.

20:43.317 --> 20:45.777
How do you find the land to work,
Mr Guthrie?

21:06.298 --> 21:07.908
Oh, Mother.

21:08.008 --> 21:10.009
Have I vexed you?

21:10.761 --> 21:12.762
Oh, not you, Chris.

21:13.931 --> 21:16.558
Just... life.

21:18.519 --> 21:20.937
I cannot tell you a thing or advise.

21:23.274 --> 21:25.358
You'll need to face men for yourself.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.488
When the time comes,
there's no one can stand and help you.

21:34.034 --> 21:36.035
Mind that for me sometime...

21:37.621 --> 21:39.873
if I cannot suffer it longer.

21:47.631 --> 21:49.632
Chrissie!

21:50.718 --> 21:52.510
Chrissie!

21:53.429 --> 21:55.555
The doctor's come, Chrissie!

22:13.324 --> 22:15.325
Now go and play outside.

22:21.790 --> 22:23.275
What's wrong?

22:23.375 --> 22:25.376
It's Mother.

22:30.591 --> 22:32.592
She's poisoned herself...

22:33.427 --> 22:35.011
and the two bairns.

22:41.518 --> 22:42.810
Why?

22:46.398 --> 22:48.399
Why did she do it?

22:49.151 --> 22:51.945
She was pregnant again
and it unbalanced her.

22:53.781 --> 22:55.683
You'd better send for Mistress Munro.

22:55.783 --> 22:57.450
No.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.956
I'll write to my sister Janet
in Auchterless.

23:05.709 --> 23:07.377
She'll come.

23:21.016 --> 23:22.626
Come on, Chris.

23:22.726 --> 23:24.670
She's ready for you.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.771
You can go up and see her now.

24:42.806 --> 24:44.474
Jean...

24:57.112 --> 24:59.030
Jean...

25:13.545 --> 25:15.755
Something died in her heart...

25:17.091 --> 25:21.010
and went down with Mother
to lie in Kinraddie Kirkyard.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.264
The child in her heart had died then...

25:26.725 --> 25:29.727
and Chris of the books and dreams
died with it.

25:31.355 --> 25:34.107
And the dark quiet corpse
that was her childhood

25:35.234 --> 25:40.238
was folded in the tissue paper
and was laid away forever.

26:15.357 --> 26:18.276
You're to come to Auchterless
with your uncle and me.

26:19.736 --> 26:21.737
So you would steal my own flesh from me?

26:22.406 --> 26:25.867
Aye, John, just as you asked
when you wrote.

26:26.910 --> 26:30.621
We've never a bairn of our own.
God knows it's not for want of trying.

26:35.252 --> 26:37.253
Ill blood breeds ill.

26:38.005 --> 26:41.575
Aye, but it'll be long
ere I'll have to kill myself

26:41.675 --> 26:44.203
because my man
beds me like a breeding sow!

26:44.303 --> 26:46.304
You dirty bitch!

26:48.140 --> 26:50.141
They won't go back to school!

26:52.978 --> 26:54.755
Why won't you go back to school?

26:54.855 --> 26:57.273
Why should they go back? I wouldn't!

26:58.442 --> 27:00.260
Oh, aye?

27:00.360 --> 27:03.029
And where do you wander off to
every night, hm?

27:05.866 --> 27:09.394
They say: <i>Whose mother's a daftie?</i>

27:09.494 --> 27:10.938
<i>Daftie</i>

27:11.038 --> 27:12.747
Daftie, they say.

27:31.516 --> 27:33.517
Well, that's all past now.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.022
You're to come and live at Auchterless
with your uncle and me.

27:43.195 --> 27:47.240
Chris, dinnae let Father make
a damn slave of you as he'd like to.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.243
We've our own lives to lead.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.082
Well, what else can I do
but bide at home now?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.381
If I saved long enough...

28:04.633 --> 28:06.634
I could go to Canada.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.679
A man is his own master there.

28:11.932 --> 28:15.142
Oh, Will, would you send for me
as your housekeeper?

28:23.235 --> 28:25.069
Aye, maybe.

28:31.159 --> 28:33.202
But maybe it would hardly suit you.

29:11.491 --> 29:13.492
I got it at Echt.

29:14.703 --> 29:16.704
We can cut the crop quicker now.

29:17.497 --> 29:20.583
I'd be the fool of Kinraddie
driving a thing like that.

29:21.752 --> 29:24.905
If Kinraddie's laughter can make
as big a fool of you as nature has,

29:25.005 --> 29:26.490
it'll be a miracle.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.659
Don't worry, lad. I'll do the driving.

29:30.093 --> 29:32.871
<i>The Lord's my shepherd</i>

29:32.971 --> 29:34.972
<i>I'll not want</i>

29:37.768 --> 29:41.228
<i>He lays me down to lie</i>

29:46.109 --> 29:49.570
<i>In pastures green, he leadeth me</i>

29:52.032 --> 29:54.992
<i>To quiet waters by</i>

29:56.787 --> 29:58.788
<i>He leadeth me</i>

30:00.165 --> 30:02.166
<i>He leadeth me</i>

30:03.293 --> 30:06.754
<i>To quiet waters by</i>

30:07.839 --> 30:09.840
Is there work?

30:12.803 --> 30:14.095
Aye, maybe.

30:15.055 --> 30:17.264
Let's see the work you have in you first.

30:18.642 --> 30:20.043
Aye.

30:20.143 --> 30:22.186
Fine, that.

30:34.825 --> 30:37.701
I'll take you on for a day or so
if the weather holds.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.079
Chris?

30:42.791 --> 30:45.736
Go up to the house and see to the supper...
no idling, mind.

30:45.836 --> 30:48.238
I won't have him in the kitchen.
He's full of lice.

30:48.338 --> 30:50.339
He can have a shake-down in the barn.

31:09.985 --> 31:14.029
You know, I'd have you eat in the house,
if it hadn't have been for Father.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.785
I'm as little anxious for his company
as he is for mine.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.535
Oh, that's such a sore waste...

32:02.746 --> 32:05.122
of hot blood like yours.

32:09.085 --> 32:10.711
A sore...

32:11.796 --> 32:13.281
waste.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.929
They'd started burning the whins
up Drumtochty way.

33:46.683 --> 33:49.002
Then it was time for the threshing dinner.

33:49.102 --> 33:51.437
And the whole of Kinraddie came.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.346
Ay, Chris.

33:59.446 --> 34:01.447
Be careful, it's hot.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.774
Losh, man, she's fair the expert getting,
the daughter.

34:10.873 --> 34:13.693
The kitchen's more her style
than the college, eh?

34:13.793 --> 34:17.004
Education... most of it's a coarse thing.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.157
Learning!

34:19.257 --> 34:21.868
Just teaches your children
a lot of damned nonsense

34:21.967 --> 34:23.370
that puts them above themselves

34:23.469 --> 34:25.956
and they'd give you their lip
soon as look at you.

34:26.056 --> 34:28.333
Damn it, man,
you're clear wrong to think that.

34:28.433 --> 34:32.128
Education's the thing if a working man
wants to put him up level with the rich.

34:32.228 --> 34:34.589
I thought a bit of balance in the bank
would do that.

34:35.857 --> 34:37.801
The more education, the more sense.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.427
Less kirks and ministers.

34:39.527 --> 34:42.347
Well, well, we'll hear nothing coarse
of religion.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.600
Well, Munro, we'll turn to
the mentally afflicted in general,

34:45.699 --> 34:47.018
not just in particular.

34:47.118 --> 34:51.496
How is that foreman of yours getting on?
Still keeping up his shorthand?

34:53.500 --> 34:55.527
Hello, Chris. How have you gotten on?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.252
Fine. How have you?

34:58.046 --> 35:01.507
God, my back would feel a damned sight
easier if I'd spent the day in my bed.

35:02.550 --> 35:04.168
Eh, Tavendale?

35:05.261 --> 35:07.137
This is Ewan Tavendale, Chris.

35:13.353 --> 35:15.354
The wind's up and a fine frost.

35:20.735 --> 35:23.570
I'm away to do the milking.

35:52.809 --> 35:54.226
Hello.

35:59.149 --> 36:00.967
Is Will about?

36:01.067 --> 36:02.276
No.

36:03.111 --> 36:05.070
Drumlithie, I think.

36:10.493 --> 36:14.580
I was hoping I could see him,
in case he should leave us sudden, like.

36:16.958 --> 36:18.459
Leave?

36:19.544 --> 36:21.545
Who said Will was leaving?

36:23.256 --> 36:26.049
I heard he was off trying for a job
in Aberdeen.

36:30.638 --> 36:32.639
Will you tell him I called?

36:39.522 --> 36:40.898
Well, ta-ta.

36:42.192 --> 36:43.484
Ta-ta.

36:59.292 --> 37:01.293
I'm off to Aberdeen today.

37:45.171 --> 37:47.714
The old fool thinks
he can frighten me still.

37:58.685 --> 38:00.435
Chris...

38:01.896 --> 38:03.856
Lord, I wish you could come as well.

38:04.357 --> 38:06.400
What? Up to Aberdeen?

38:07.735 --> 38:09.903
I'd like it fine but I can't.

38:20.748 --> 38:23.333
Hurry and dress,
else you'll miss your train.

38:47.901 --> 38:50.110
Are you having a sleep before you set out?

38:50.987 --> 38:52.988
All right. I'll soon be down.

39:20.099 --> 39:21.600
Well?

39:23.227 --> 39:25.228
Will I do?

39:32.028 --> 39:33.987
You look fair brave.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.677
Oh, hell.

41:35.151 --> 41:37.152
Why did she leave us?

41:40.948 --> 41:42.949
Why did Jean leave us?

41:49.749 --> 41:51.693
Happy New Year.

41:51.793 --> 41:53.418
Am I the first?

41:54.212 --> 41:56.213
Aye, you're fairly that.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.049
Happy New Year.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.929
God Almighty, Chae,
you cannae be sleeping there.

42:05.598 --> 42:08.850
You big old lump.
I thought I was the first foot.

42:09.977 --> 42:13.980
<i>Farewell and adieu to you
fair Spanish ladies</i>

42:14.524 --> 42:18.610
<i>Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain</i>

42:19.237 --> 42:23.031
<i>For we've received orders
to come back to where we lay</i>

42:23.699 --> 42:26.785
<i>From The Broch to Peterhead and back again</i>

42:27.829 --> 42:32.332
<i>We'll rant and we'll roar
like true Scottish sailors</i>

42:32.750 --> 42:36.795
<i>We'll rant and we'll roar
across the North Sea</i>

42:37.755 --> 42:41.967
<i>For we've received orders
to come back to Blawearie</i>

42:43.010 --> 42:46.054
<i>From The Broch to Peterhead and back again</i>

42:46.973 --> 42:51.184
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

42:51.894 --> 42:55.397
<i>Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain</i>

42:56.649 --> 43:00.777
<i>For we've received orders
to come back to Blawearie</i>

43:01.946 --> 43:06.950
<i>From The Broch to Peterhead and back again</i>

43:38.482 --> 43:40.426
Ah, Jean.

43:40.526 --> 43:42.527
All right, Jean, lass.

43:45.531 --> 43:49.492
Get in the house, you white-faced bitch!

43:50.620 --> 43:52.329
Get away!

44:25.529 --> 44:27.447
What's wrong with you now?

44:28.908 --> 44:30.450
Nothing.

44:32.453 --> 44:34.996
For you to find out.

44:36.791 --> 44:41.253
What the hell...

44:42.046 --> 44:47.592
are you getting... paid for?

44:51.138 --> 44:53.181
Help me strip him, Chris.

44:55.226 --> 44:57.227
It's a stroke, Chris.

44:59.272 --> 45:00.981
Yes, Doctor.

45:09.615 --> 45:11.616
He'll need a lot of looking after.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.338
Will's married Mollie Douglas.

46:54.220 --> 46:57.290
They've sailed from Southampton
to the Argentine.

47:14.740 --> 47:16.741
Just blow the whistle if you need me.

47:38.222 --> 47:40.265
You're my flesh and blood.

47:43.477 --> 47:46.521
And I can do with you what I will.

48:20.473 --> 48:22.098
Chris!

48:25.352 --> 48:26.978
Chris!

49:18.655 --> 49:20.256
Chris?

50:00.990 --> 50:02.933
Chris, lass.

50:04.133 --> 50:05.809
What's wrong?

50:06.412 --> 50:08.413
Chae, my father's dead.

50:15.087 --> 50:17.046
She was no longer afraid...

50:18.257 --> 50:23.094
only sad for the father she never helped
and forgot to love.

50:30.477 --> 50:32.478
Will you have a dram, Reverend?

50:33.564 --> 50:35.481
Spirits?

50:36.275 --> 50:38.010
Och, aye.

50:38.110 --> 50:40.111
It's the custom, isn't it?

50:42.948 --> 50:44.949
Yes, thank you, I'll have a drop.

51:17.399 --> 51:20.068
Do you want to see him
before he's screwed down?

51:59.358 --> 52:01.359
Now, kiss your father.

52:05.364 --> 52:07.365
Goodbye, Father.

52:37.062 --> 52:40.841
"I, John Guthrie of Blawearie,
being of sound mind and body,

52:40.941 --> 52:45.137
do hereby leave and bequeath to my
daughter Christine all my possessions,

52:45.237 --> 52:49.183
in silver and belongings, to
be hers without let or condition.

52:49.283 --> 52:52.311
I also appoint Peter Semple
as my daughter's guardian

52:52.411 --> 52:54.396
in such law matters as needs one.

52:54.496 --> 52:58.067
But she is to control the goods and gear
as she may please.

52:58.167 --> 53:02.003
The monies amounting to £300
I also bequeath to her.

53:02.838 --> 53:05.006
Given under my hand etc, etc."

53:09.553 --> 53:11.804
So, think it well over, Miss Guthrie.

53:13.140 --> 53:16.669
Not a word for Will
or his two motherless boys?

53:16.769 --> 53:18.712
Oh, for shame, Tam.

53:18.812 --> 53:21.606
How can they be motherless
now that I've got them?

53:23.650 --> 53:27.612
And you'll come up to live with us when
you've sold Blawearie's furnishings.

53:28.906 --> 53:30.573
Aye, maybe.

53:37.581 --> 53:38.831
Where are you going?

53:39.500 --> 53:42.210
Oh, I'm away to Stonehaven
to see Mr Semple.

53:43.003 --> 53:44.530
Can I bring you anything?

53:44.630 --> 53:46.615
What are you jaunting there for?

53:46.715 --> 53:48.800
I'll transact any business you have.

53:49.176 --> 53:51.286
I'll transact my own business fine.

53:51.386 --> 53:52.804
Ta-ta.

53:59.102 --> 54:00.937
Come in.

54:07.736 --> 54:09.570
Sit you down.

54:12.491 --> 54:14.560
Well, well, it's Miss Guthrie come up.

54:14.660 --> 54:16.979
You've been thinking about the will,
no doubt.

54:17.079 --> 54:19.080
Yes, just that.

54:20.165 --> 54:24.043
I'm going to live on at Blawearie a while
and not roup the gear at once.

54:25.045 --> 54:27.046
Could you see to that with the factor?

54:27.756 --> 54:30.466
But you cannae live there alone.

54:31.134 --> 54:33.287
Oh, no, I've no such intention.

54:33.387 --> 54:35.497
Could you get me some woman
to come live with me,

54:35.597 --> 54:37.723
some old body who'd be glad of the work?

54:38.350 --> 54:40.017
Oh, God, there are plenty of them.

54:40.519 --> 54:43.213
Oh, it'll just be for a month or two,
just till I'm settled.

54:43.313 --> 54:45.215
There's Mistress Melon.

54:45.315 --> 54:47.009
I'll send her down in the morn.

54:47.109 --> 54:48.860
Thank you.

54:50.279 --> 54:52.222
Goodbye.

54:52.322 --> 54:54.323
Goodbye, Miss Guthrie.

55:18.765 --> 55:20.709
Are you up for the day?

55:20.809 --> 55:22.810
Aye. Och, aye, just that.

55:24.688 --> 55:26.632
I'm up to the inn for dinner.

55:26.732 --> 55:28.357
Aye.

55:30.861 --> 55:33.930
Maybe... Maybe we could eat together?

55:36.617 --> 55:38.185
Aye.

55:38.285 --> 55:40.286
So you're in no hurry to be back?

55:41.830 --> 55:44.074
Not unless you should be, no.

55:52.883 --> 55:54.884
Tired, Chrissie?

55:55.928 --> 55:57.929
Losh, no.

56:00.140 --> 56:02.183
And my name's Chris, Ewan.

56:16.823 --> 56:18.725
Are you all right, Chrissie?

56:18.825 --> 56:20.534
Yes, fine!

56:58.115 --> 57:00.116
Chris!

57:00.993 --> 57:02.994
Chris, where are you?

57:04.538 --> 57:06.539
- Chris!
- Chrissie?

57:07.791 --> 57:09.792
- Chris!
- Chrissie?

57:28.270 --> 57:30.213
I'll see to the horses.

57:30.313 --> 57:32.049
Take her back to my house.

57:32.149 --> 57:34.134
In you come. God, Chris.

57:34.234 --> 57:36.777
Get out of your coat,
you must be fair soaked.

57:37.112 --> 57:39.056
Ewan, I've nothing on below.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.266
- What, nothing at all?
- Not very much, Chae.

57:41.366 --> 57:44.102
- You can slip into that.
- But Mistress Strachan?

57:44.202 --> 57:47.314
The old wife's in bed.
She'd sleep through a hundred storms.

57:47.414 --> 57:49.358
Through there, get off your things.

57:49.458 --> 57:53.127
Bring them to dry. I'll have something
warm for you both to drink.

58:37.714 --> 58:39.658
You'll get your death of cold.

58:39.758 --> 58:41.467
Sit closer.

58:45.013 --> 58:47.681
God, Chris. Was that all you had on?

58:48.350 --> 58:49.475
Aye.

59:09.955 --> 59:11.956
I'll see you back to Blawearie.

01:00:01.089 --> 01:00:03.033
Are you warm enough?

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:05.134
Fine.

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.483
Oh, don't.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:38.542
Wait, Ewan.

01:00:40.462 --> 01:00:42.421
Come up to see me tomorrow evening.

01:00:48.595 --> 01:00:50.387
Chris...

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.685
will you marry me?

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:04.360
You're in fine tune this morning.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:08.072
Aye, Uncle. I am that.

01:01:08.949 --> 01:01:10.950
How did the horses fare in the storm?

01:01:12.077 --> 01:01:14.078
I took them into the barn.

01:01:15.956 --> 01:01:17.957
Ewan Tavendale helped me.

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:22.336
Ach, it's plain you've nae need
for relatives here.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.464
I only pray you don't come to disaster.

01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:28.676
No need to cry about it yet, Auntie Janet.

01:01:29.761 --> 01:01:31.762
Ewan and I haven't lain together.

01:01:33.139 --> 01:01:35.766
We'll wait... till we're married.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.461
He's to marry you, then?

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.505
I hope so.

01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:42.657
But you never know.

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:46.819
Morning.

01:01:48.947 --> 01:01:50.781
I'll drive you both to the station.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.461
I'll bring back Mistress Melon.

01:02:13.346 --> 01:02:15.347
Walk on. Walk on.

01:02:19.686 --> 01:02:21.145
Go on.

01:02:28.987 --> 01:02:30.988
Now Blawearie was hers...

01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:34.742
and she Blawearie's.

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:43.709
And in all of the days to come,
her heart would beat in this land.

01:02:48.214 --> 01:02:50.215
And she would be content.

01:03:11.738 --> 01:03:14.365
- Where'll I put my box, mem?
- Oh, inside.

01:03:17.118 --> 01:03:19.062
Maybe you'll stay to dinner, Chae?

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.163
Oh, aye, fine that.

01:03:30.298 --> 01:03:32.033
God.

01:03:32.133 --> 01:03:34.134
That was right fine, Chris.

01:03:35.136 --> 01:03:37.137
Is there any more on the go?

01:03:45.438 --> 01:03:46.605
Good Lord, Chris.

01:03:47.774 --> 01:03:51.068
They'll right soon be after you,
the lads, with your eyes like that.

01:03:58.326 --> 01:04:00.536
How will we partition the work, mem?

01:04:01.955 --> 01:04:06.458
Oh, um, you do the cooking and
the cleaning, and I'll see to the rest.

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:09.670
- Aye, mem.
- And my name's Chris.

01:04:10.338 --> 01:04:11.964
We're no gentry.

01:05:26.039 --> 01:05:28.040
We'll have to wait to get married.

01:05:30.001 --> 01:05:32.252
I've got no more than £100 saved.

01:05:35.924 --> 01:05:37.925
I have 300.

01:05:40.053 --> 01:05:41.996
No credit to me.

01:05:42.096 --> 01:05:44.097
It was Father's saving.

01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:51.355
You know, if we marry fair soon, you
can take over the Blawearie lease.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.354
That would be fine.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:02.327
We'll have the whole of Kinraddie
here when we wed.

01:07:02.427 --> 01:07:03.745
Aye.

01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:06.513
Most folk will be free to come
on New Year's Eve.

01:07:16.024 --> 01:07:18.609
I had a letter from Auntie Janet
and Uncle Tam.

01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:23.905
They say it's too soon after Father's
death to wed... so they won't come.

01:07:27.034 --> 01:07:29.788
Damn it, you're only married
once as a general rule.

01:07:29.888 --> 01:07:32.982
It'll no hurt the old man
in Kinraddie Kirkyard.

01:07:36.461 --> 01:07:38.404
Is this a list for the food?

01:07:38.504 --> 01:07:39.781
Aye.

01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:42.090
Oh, such extravagance!

01:07:42.508 --> 01:07:44.885
You've ordered enough food
to feed the French.

01:07:48.139 --> 01:07:50.140
You'll have nae silver left.

01:07:57.982 --> 01:08:00.150
So I'll... I'll put the banns up tomorrow.

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:04.973
You know Reverend Gibbon will say,

01:08:05.073 --> 01:08:09.618
"It seems strange to hold a display
so close to Mr Guthrie's death."

01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:15.624
Aye, and I'll say, "The service that
I want is a wedding, not a sermon."

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.506
Better be off.

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:35.977
Take care of yourself.

01:08:36.688 --> 01:08:38.104
Aye.

01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:22.939
Oh, thank you!

01:09:26.904 --> 01:09:28.488
Oh, the barn!

01:09:29.323 --> 01:09:31.323
It isn't half spruce for the dance.

01:09:32.743 --> 01:09:35.897
Ach, just leave it to us, Chris.
Tell us what you want.

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.707
Oh... thank you.

01:09:41.127 --> 01:09:43.670
Oh, it... it's like a picture book.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.341
Aye.

01:09:49.635 --> 01:09:52.636
This time the morn,
you'll be a married woman, Chris.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.000
Sleep well the night.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.893
Oh, fine that.

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:01.923
You know, if...
if I ever thought of getting married...

01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:04.884
I'd think it fine to sleep
with a lass like yourself.

01:10:04.984 --> 01:10:06.928
Get away, Rob.

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:09.237
Much sleep you'd give her. Come on.

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:19.664
Strange and eerie it was standing there.

01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:24.044
That this marriage of hers was nothing...

01:10:26.964 --> 01:10:31.218
that it would pass on and forward into
the days that had long forgotten it.

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:39.001
And the face of the land change
and change again

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.436
till the last light sank away from it.

01:10:44.315 --> 01:10:47.317
And all of her love and tears for Ewan,

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:51.488
not even a ripple on that flood
of water remain in the time to be.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:58.370
Strange to think that tomorrow
and all the tomorrows...

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:03.166
Ewan would share her room
and her bed with her.

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:12.034
How d'you feel
on your marriage morn, Chris?

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:13.927
Fine.

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:20.267
Och, I hope you'll be awful happy
and soon have three bairns.

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:23.687
You never know.

01:11:31.571 --> 01:11:33.613
If only Mother could be here.

01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:37.242
Oh, don't be a fool.

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:57.971
Are you ready, Chris?

01:12:00.725 --> 01:12:02.267
Let us pray.

01:12:04.937 --> 01:12:08.356
Dear God, bless this union.

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:12.110
Give them strength and courage

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.906
for the difficulties that the years
might bring to them.

01:12:17.408 --> 01:12:19.409
Make fruitful their marriage...

01:12:20.828 --> 01:12:27.125
and make their love as pure and enduring
in its fulfilment as in its conception.

01:12:58.866 --> 01:13:00.810
Here's to you, Chris.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.828
Raise your glasses, folks,
the best man has a toast.

01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:13.088
I've never seen a sweeter bride, or
known a better friend than the groom.

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.050
I wish them long and lovely days...

01:13:17.885 --> 01:13:20.538
from the summer to the winter
of their lives.

01:13:20.638 --> 01:13:22.263
The bride!

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:24.750
Best of luck to her!

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:39.130
Right! Who's game
for a dance at Chris's wedding?

01:14:14.191 --> 01:14:16.218
Hey up, what about a song?

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.762
Ladies Of Spain.

01:14:17.862 --> 01:14:20.264
What about
The Lass That Made The Bed For Me?

01:14:20.364 --> 01:14:22.365
A song from the bride.

01:14:25.911 --> 01:14:31.791
<i>I've heard them lilting</i>

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:40.091
<i>At our ewe-milking</i>

01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:47.599
<i>Lassies a-lilting</i>

01:14:48.392 --> 01:14:53.855
<i>Before dawn o' day</i>

01:14:56.442 --> 01:15:02.864
<i>Sighing and moaning</i>

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:09.287
<i>On ilka green loaning</i>

01:15:11.415 --> 01:15:18.880
<i>The flowers of the forest</i>

01:15:20.466 --> 01:15:27.639
<i>Are a' wede away</i>

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:49.661
It's New Year.

01:15:50.454 --> 01:15:55.526
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

01:15:55.626 --> 01:16:01.115
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

01:16:01.215 --> 01:16:07.163
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:12.392
<i>For the sake of auld lang syne?</i>

01:16:13.185 --> 01:16:18.841
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:23.903
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:16:24.738 --> 01:16:30.644
<i>We'll tak' a cup of kindness yet</i>

01:16:30.744 --> 01:16:36.624
<i>For the sake of auld lang syne</i>

01:16:47.511 --> 01:16:49.470
Long Rob was right.

01:16:54.852 --> 01:16:57.729
You're the bonniest thing
ever seen in Kinraddie.

01:18:14.431 --> 01:18:17.058
Ewan. Put out the light.

01:18:29.113 --> 01:18:31.197
So that was her marriage.

01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:37.161
Not like waking from a dream
but like going into one.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:42.417
And she wasn't sure, not for days,

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:46.754
what things she had dreamt
and what actually done.

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:08.735
I'm back to Stonehaven today.

01:19:10.321 --> 01:19:12.264
Oh.

01:19:12.364 --> 01:19:14.308
I'll miss you.

01:19:14.408 --> 01:19:15.935
Aye.

01:19:16.035 --> 01:19:17.618
Fine.

01:19:24.084 --> 01:19:26.169
Fare thee well.

01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:07.486
- Your hand's freezing.
- Och, away, you're still asleep!

01:20:07.586 --> 01:20:10.505
You've got to be up in the morning,
that's the thing.

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:43.931
Look at my hands, red with the scrubbing.

01:20:45.165 --> 01:20:47.151
Oh, you're daft! The place is fine.

01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:48.777
What more d'you want?

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.336
Less dirt.

01:20:51.004 --> 01:20:53.115
Maybe you like it but I don't.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.299
Well, maybe I do.

01:20:57.511 --> 01:20:59.279
I like you right well.

01:21:06.937 --> 01:21:09.689
Folks blithe and young as themselves

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:13.901
had once walked, talked
and taken their pleasure here.

01:21:17.948 --> 01:21:20.408
And she tried to tell Ewan
of her daft fancy.

01:21:22.286 --> 01:21:25.079
But all he said was, "Aye."

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:41.205
And once she had thought

01:21:41.305 --> 01:21:44.849
there wouldn't be a thing
they wouldn't understand together.

01:22:13.879 --> 01:22:15.880
I missed you! I missed you!

01:22:18.175 --> 01:22:20.176
Oh, I missed you.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.587
I forgot to unyoke Clyde.

01:22:30.687 --> 01:22:32.271
I missed you.

01:22:39.363 --> 01:22:41.306
We might well have more sense.

01:22:41.406 --> 01:22:43.407
I missed you.

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:48.439
Damn Blawearie.

01:22:48.539 --> 01:22:50.482
Let's have a holiday the day, Chris.

01:22:50.582 --> 01:22:52.875
I can't. I'm cleaning.

01:22:53.919 --> 01:22:56.571
Are you to spend all your days cleaning?

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.339
You'll be old and wizened.

01:23:00.217 --> 01:23:02.634
Now, off on a holiday we'll go today.

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:13.271
You are a shameless limmer.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.568
For sure.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:24.532
And you're not yet 19.

01:23:31.164 --> 01:23:34.250
And then the old Chris crept out
from below the trees

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.987
where the new Chris lay,

01:23:37.087 --> 01:23:39.672
and went into the quiet of the afternoon.

01:23:41.341 --> 01:23:45.845
The new Chris heard her go and she
came back to Blawearie never again.

01:23:48.473 --> 01:23:53.686
But she would not tell Ewan,
not then, not just then...

01:23:54.855 --> 01:24:01.193
for it was she, and only she,
that felt and knew the wonder of God.

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:13.080
And the fruit ripened while
the source slept all unaware.

01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:21.297
Now, what's this you've been doing,
Chris Guthrie?

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:28.763
Well, well, that's fine.

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:33.225
Now let's see a bit more of you,
Mistress Tavendale.

01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:38.507
You're gonna be a father, Blawearie man.

01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:40.608
Now, what do you think of that?

01:24:45.155 --> 01:24:49.742
Away and make me a cup of tea while
Chris and I go into more intimate details.

01:24:52.037 --> 01:24:53.730
Well, you needn't abide.

01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:55.665
She's safe enough with an old man...

01:24:57.334 --> 01:24:59.335
bonny though she be.

01:25:02.673 --> 01:25:06.676
<i>When my wee lass made the bed to me</i>

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:12.932
<i>My bonny lass made the bed to me</i>

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:19.480
<i>When my wee lass made the bed to me</i>

01:25:33.286 --> 01:25:37.957
<i>I'll ne'er forget till the day I die</i>

01:25:39.251 --> 01:25:44.422
<i>That my wee lass made the bed for me</i>

01:25:50.053 --> 01:25:51.997
Thank you for the flowers, Rob.

01:25:52.097 --> 01:25:56.642
Oh, they'll be for the son, eh, Chris?
And er... when you having him born, eh?

01:25:57.394 --> 01:26:00.505
Oh, er... late September, early October.

01:26:00.605 --> 01:26:02.716
Aye, there'll soon be a family
Blawearie way.

01:26:02.816 --> 01:26:03.967
Aye.

01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:06.569
It's the reckoning for the corn, Rob.

01:26:08.488 --> 01:26:11.949
Aye, they're aye daft devils
fighting a' something or other.

01:26:12.576 --> 01:26:14.227
It's a lot of damned nonsense.

01:26:14.327 --> 01:26:17.481
Well, they can fight themselves
black and blue for all I care.

01:26:17.581 --> 01:26:19.582
Hey, for all we care.

01:26:20.917 --> 01:26:22.251
Aye.

01:26:31.595 --> 01:26:33.637
- Don't run.
- Don't blether.

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:46.734
Things are changing for the better...
all around.

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.622
There's a war on!
Britain is to war with Germany!

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.695
Oh! Oh!

01:27:50.257 --> 01:27:53.551
Chris. Lie still.

01:27:54.219 --> 01:27:56.303
Go downstairs, Ewan.

01:28:01.351 --> 01:28:06.397
I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:28:51.902 --> 01:28:53.944
It's all right.

01:29:23.642 --> 01:29:25.836
He'll be good like his mother.

01:29:25.936 --> 01:29:28.020
He'll be quick of temper like you.

01:29:29.272 --> 01:29:31.273
God, maybe you're right.

01:29:32.192 --> 01:29:36.070
You could hardly be wrong in a thing after
bringing a bairn like that into the world.

01:29:36.947 --> 01:29:39.031
But you helped a little.

01:29:44.454 --> 01:29:47.957
We'll call him Ewan, after his father.

01:29:55.173 --> 01:30:00.052
Maybe there was war and bloodshed...
and that was awful.

01:30:01.554 --> 01:30:06.892
But far off also you'd hear it
like the North Sea cry in the morning.

01:30:07.227 --> 01:30:10.104
A crying and a thunder
that became unending,

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.701
as the weeks went by, part of life's plan.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:20.140
But Chris didn't care,
sitting there at Blawearie,

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.992
with her baim and her man by her side.

01:30:25.611 --> 01:30:27.996
Aye-aye, folks, are thee in?

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:32.626
God, Chris, I'm nae a ghost yet.

01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:36.364
You're havering, man. You don't mean it.

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.549
But I am.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.203
I've enlisted in the North Highlanders
and I'm off to Perth tonight.

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:44.388
Oh, Chae. No.

01:30:45.682 --> 01:30:47.516
Well, have yourself a dram then.

01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:04.616
Who'll win?

01:31:05.201 --> 01:31:07.812
Well, if the Germans do,
there'd be an end to peace forever.

01:31:07.912 --> 01:31:09.788
Och, to hell with them.

01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:14.293
Hey.

01:31:17.255 --> 01:31:19.339
I mind the day he was born.

01:31:21.259 --> 01:31:23.343
Just like yesterday it was.

01:31:26.097 --> 01:31:27.931
A spring of life, eh, Chris?

01:31:30.435 --> 01:31:32.504
Sing it.

01:31:32.604 --> 01:31:34.688
Cherish it.

01:31:35.065 --> 01:31:37.107
'Twill never come again.

01:31:39.611 --> 01:31:41.445
Aye.

01:31:42.739 --> 01:31:45.407
You've brought out
a fine bairn between youse.

01:31:50.246 --> 01:31:53.916
Every man may have to fight for wife
and bairn ere this war is over.

01:31:58.129 --> 01:32:01.215
So you don't think I should join up, Chae?

01:32:03.927 --> 01:32:05.928
Nah.

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:09.082
There's fools enough
in the fight as it is.

01:32:09.182 --> 01:32:11.433
What a blether about a war.

01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:13.378
Och...

01:32:13.478 --> 01:32:15.296
Like I was asking, only.

01:32:16.523 --> 01:32:18.565
Aye, man.

01:32:19.651 --> 01:32:21.094
Aye, man.

01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:24.806
Huh.

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:28.534
Chae Strachan. You're an exception.

01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:33.898
Oh, man. You know, I'd come back
with you in the morning if only...

01:32:33.998 --> 01:32:35.374
If only what, man?

01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:42.965
Well, if only I wanted to be easy...
easy and a liar.

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:46.468
But I'm damned
if I'm gonna begin for a bit of war.

01:32:48.888 --> 01:32:51.181
Have you seen the casualty list, Chae?

01:32:51.516 --> 01:32:53.585
Have you?

01:32:53.685 --> 01:32:58.355
50,000 poor bastards blown to hell
for a couple of yards of Belgian mud.

01:32:59.023 --> 01:33:00.759
Men gassed.

01:33:00.859 --> 01:33:04.220
- Men mutilated and blinded...
- These were brave men.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.321
Or stupid.

01:33:09.242 --> 01:33:11.326
They're saying you're cowards.

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:15.664
Better a coward than a corpse.

01:33:18.501 --> 01:33:21.628
Look, lads, I believe in the war.

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:26.258
I believe it'll bring good to the world.

01:33:28.678 --> 01:33:31.289
It'll bring the days of Socialism
to the common folk.

01:33:31.389 --> 01:33:33.473
Oh, the common folk. Yeah.

01:33:34.684 --> 01:33:37.519
When they're no' sheep, they're swine.

01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:47.362
Well...

01:33:50.533 --> 01:33:52.534
I'd better be off then.

01:34:05.089 --> 01:34:10.829
<i>All in the April evening</i>

01:34:10.929 --> 01:34:17.836
<i>April airs were abroad</i>

01:34:17.936 --> 01:34:24.676
<i>The sheep with their little lambs</i>

01:34:24.776 --> 01:34:31.766
<i>Passed me by on the road</i>

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:39.623
<i>The sheep with their little lambs
The sheep with their lambs</i>

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:47.005
<i>Passed me by on the road</i>

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:55.874
<i>All in the April evening</i>

01:34:55.974 --> 01:35:05.633
<i>I thought on the Lamb of God</i>

01:35:11.114 --> 01:35:20.190
<i>The lambs were weary and crying</i>

01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:28.239
<i>With a weak human cry</i>

01:35:28.339 --> 01:35:35.747
<i>I thought on the Lamb of God</i>

01:35:35.847 --> 01:35:44.797
<i>Going meekly to die</i>

01:35:44.897 --> 01:35:52.931
<i>Up in the blue, blue mountains</i>

01:35:53.031 --> 01:36:00.787
<i>Dewy pastures are sweet</i>

01:36:01.164 --> 01:36:10.130
<i>Rest for the little bodies</i>

01:36:10.548 --> 01:36:19.183
<i>Rest for the little feet</i>

01:36:22.185 --> 01:36:24.796
<i>But for the Lamb</i>

01:36:24.896 --> 01:36:29.092
<i>The Lamb of God</i>

01:36:29.192 --> 01:36:37.100
<i>Up on the hilltop green</i>

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:44.649
<i>Only a cross, a cross of shame</i>

01:36:44.749 --> 01:36:53.574
<i>Two stark crosses between</i>

01:36:53.674 --> 01:37:01.165
<i>All in the April evening</i>

01:37:01.265 --> 01:37:10.008
<i>April airs were abroad</i>

01:37:10.108 --> 01:37:15.346
<i>I saw the sheep</i>

01:37:15.446 --> 01:37:20.768
<i>With their lambs</i>

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:24.147
<i>And thought</i>

01:37:24.247 --> 01:37:34.051
<i>On the Lamb of God</i>

01:37:44.475 --> 01:37:46.893
As you know,
we are now at war with Germany.

01:37:49.647 --> 01:37:51.982
This new Babylon...

01:37:53.693 --> 01:37:56.736
has as many corruptions as the old one.

01:37:59.198 --> 01:38:04.494
How long it will rage only God
in His wisdom and anger will know.

01:38:09.667 --> 01:38:15.422
But it's a chastisement,
by blood and fire...

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:21.871
that the nations must arise
and prevail against this enemy.

01:38:21.971 --> 01:38:26.459
And Scotland, not least of these,

01:38:26.559 --> 01:38:30.004
in its ancient health and humility

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:34.941
to tread again
the path of peace and courage...

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:38.570
that will ultimately lead to our victory.

01:38:42.909 --> 01:38:44.910
Their king...

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.371
which they call Kaiser...

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.709
is the Antichrist.

01:38:54.253 --> 01:39:00.717
A foul evil upon this earth
which must be swept away by the righteous.

01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:06.473
And those who will not fight
to defend their country...

01:39:08.559 --> 01:39:13.438
must be exposed for that they truly are.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.360
Cowards.

01:39:19.362 --> 01:39:23.448
And pro-German cowards at that.

01:39:26.494 --> 01:39:28.578
Leave 'em. Let them be. Let them be.

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:40.423
What does it mean, Rob?

01:39:40.967 --> 01:39:44.844
They send white feathers to the cowards.
I've already had mine.

01:39:45.096 --> 01:39:48.875
They're all Government men ready to die
for the King any day of the week.

01:39:48.975 --> 01:39:51.059
Oh, and twice on Sundays.

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.647
They say Parliament's
to pass a Conscription Act.

01:39:56.232 --> 01:39:58.050
That means if...

01:39:58.150 --> 01:40:01.679
if we don't volunteer,
they'll make us go anyway.

01:40:01.779 --> 01:40:04.447
Well, it will...
it will be a bit of a jaunt.

01:40:04.699 --> 01:40:07.993
- Huh?
- But will you both be taken?

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.205
Aye.

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:17.069
But you've been excused before.

01:40:17.169 --> 01:40:19.671
They don't take folk
who farm their own land.

01:40:30.433 --> 01:40:32.517
I'm to report to Aberdeen.

01:40:41.819 --> 01:40:44.446
- Oh, Ewan.
- It's only for assessment.

01:40:45.656 --> 01:40:47.741
I'm going too.

01:40:48.618 --> 01:40:50.702
We'll go together.

01:40:53.164 --> 01:40:57.167
Now don't worry, lass,
they'll have to carry us to the front.

01:41:34.413 --> 01:41:36.122
Where are you going?

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:43.129
To Aberdeen.

01:42:21.919 --> 01:42:23.920
He's enlisted.

01:42:24.755 --> 01:42:26.756
He's gone to fight.

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:32.345
It'll soon be over.

01:42:34.432 --> 01:42:36.433
You've not to worry.

01:42:37.309 --> 01:42:39.310
Ewan'll be fine.

01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:49.654
Oh, but that spring was long.

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:55.535
But the hills flowed up and down,
day after day...

01:42:57.955 --> 01:43:00.399
and Chris saw the harvest near.

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:04.711
A good harvest, in spite of all things.

01:43:07.298 --> 01:43:10.675
And the grain a fine price,
so farming folk did well.

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:17.807
Soon maybe the war would end

01:43:18.768 --> 01:43:21.936
and they'd all be back in Kinraddie
as once they had been...

01:43:23.022 --> 01:43:27.358
Long Rob and Chae... and her Ewan.

01:43:52.176 --> 01:43:55.261
This is hardly the place for me
with your man come home.

01:43:56.138 --> 01:43:58.207
I'll away to Bervie for the night, then.

01:43:58.307 --> 01:44:00.099
Aye.

01:44:16.408 --> 01:44:18.910
Hell, Chris, what a bloody place!

01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:36.386
Ewan, who's this?

01:44:39.139 --> 01:44:40.807
It's Father.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.560
Well, we hope so. Eh, Chris?

01:44:47.565 --> 01:44:49.649
Go through to the parlour.

01:44:50.693 --> 01:44:52.694
Good lad. Go.

01:45:00.077 --> 01:45:02.021
Any supper left?

01:45:02.121 --> 01:45:05.316
Unless you're too bloody stand-offish
to even have that.

01:45:05.416 --> 01:45:07.959
Oh, Christ's sake, let a man sit down.

01:45:18.262 --> 01:45:20.263
Well, give me some tea.

01:46:03.807 --> 01:46:07.837
Well, damn it, don't you have anything to
say to me now that I've come home?

01:46:07.937 --> 01:46:11.147
I'd have done better to spend
the night with a tart in the town!

01:46:12.942 --> 01:46:15.886
God Almighty, what are you
snivelling about now?

01:46:15.986 --> 01:46:18.055
You're always snivelling!

01:46:18.155 --> 01:46:19.865
Ewan.

01:46:22.451 --> 01:46:24.854
Well, you be stand-offish now if you can!

01:46:24.954 --> 01:46:26.579
Get off me!

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:31.343
What I get regular in Lanark,
I now want from you.

01:46:32.294 --> 01:46:34.295
What d'you think I came home for?

01:46:34.713 --> 01:46:37.090
Now that you know that... get!

01:46:41.637 --> 01:46:43.581
Mummy!

01:46:53.399 --> 01:46:55.400
For God's sake, hurry up!

01:47:24.847 --> 01:47:27.041
- Ewan, put out the light.
- I'll do that.

01:47:27.141 --> 01:47:29.142
- Put out the light.
- I'll do that!

01:48:09.475 --> 01:48:12.935
Put out the light, Ewan!
Put out the light!

01:48:39.588 --> 01:48:41.631
God, what a damned glower!

01:48:42.257 --> 01:48:44.717
Eyes like your mother
and a nature the same.

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:48.763
Will you wear a suit, Ewan?

01:48:50.099 --> 01:48:52.183
What, me, look like a bloody conchy?

01:48:55.354 --> 01:48:56.797
I need some money.

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:58.898
I'm off to Drumlithie.

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.081
I'm entitled to what's my own.

01:50:50.385 --> 01:50:53.330
When the hell
are you bringing some breakfast?

01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:56.224
If you're in need of some breakfast,
get it!

01:51:01.438 --> 01:51:04.383
- Have you gone clean...
- I'll not be treated like a Lanark tart!

01:51:04.483 --> 01:51:05.592
You bitch!

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:07.636
I am not frightened of you!

01:51:07.736 --> 01:51:10.139
No! No, you can afford to be brave.

01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:12.599
You're no' the one
that's gotta go to France!

01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:14.643
Why... Then why did you enlist?

01:51:14.743 --> 01:51:18.454
Cos I was sick of folk laughing at me,
jeering at me for a coward!

01:51:19.957 --> 01:51:23.251
And you, you're blethering
that your man's no longer polite!

01:52:42.873 --> 01:52:44.874
Oh, Ewan.

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:10.649
Everything was changing.

01:53:11.693 --> 01:53:14.320
And as the land changed, so did Chris.

01:53:16.114 --> 01:53:18.115
She looked for the days gone by.

01:53:19.076 --> 01:53:22.521
She looked to see the faces of her
mother and father in the firelight

01:53:22.621 --> 01:53:24.622
before the lamps were lit.

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:28.834
Faces dear and close to her.

01:53:31.463 --> 01:53:34.741
She wanted to hear the words
they'd known and used

01:53:34.841 --> 01:53:37.051
in the far-off youngness of their lives.

01:53:38.637 --> 01:53:40.580
Scots words,

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.417
to tell to your heart
how they wrung it and held it

01:53:43.517 --> 01:53:45.601
through all of the toil of their days.

01:53:46.478 --> 01:53:48.562
And the unending fight with the land.

01:53:52.067 --> 01:53:54.068
And a queer thought came to her.

01:53:57.114 --> 01:53:59.433
Nothing endured but the land.

01:54:02.786 --> 01:54:06.038
Sea, sky and the folk
who live there were but a breath.

01:54:09.793 --> 01:54:11.794
But the land endured.

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:15.381
And, at that moment,

01:54:16.466 --> 01:54:18.467
she felt in the gloaming...

01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:21.971
that she was the land.

01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:56.630
I'll put Ewan to bed.

01:54:58.800 --> 01:54:59.967
Aye.

01:55:37.797 --> 01:55:39.798
Thank you.

01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:56.190
What do I do?

01:55:57.234 --> 01:55:59.235
Oh, what do I do?

01:56:01.863 --> 01:56:03.864
What do I do?

01:56:07.953 --> 01:56:09.703
Did you cry me, Chris?

01:56:21.967 --> 01:56:23.910
What do I do, John?

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:26.053
Do I have to go to France?

01:56:29.558 --> 01:56:31.559
It's sore news.

01:56:38.108 --> 01:56:40.109
But he died out there like a man...

01:56:43.488 --> 01:56:45.155
your Ewan.

01:56:50.829 --> 01:56:52.830
It's a lie.

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.084
They're lying.

01:56:58.962 --> 01:57:00.655
He's not dead.

01:57:00.755 --> 01:57:02.631
My Ewan's not dead!

01:57:03.425 --> 01:57:05.718
It's a lie! It's a lie!

01:57:08.305 --> 01:57:09.888
It's a lie!

01:57:10.682 --> 01:57:12.683
It's a lie!

01:57:12.976 --> 01:57:14.310
It's a lie!

01:57:15.645 --> 01:57:17.605
It's a lie!

01:57:20.775 --> 01:57:22.443
"Country and King".

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:26.822
What have they to do with my Ewan?

01:57:28.533 --> 01:57:30.534
Blawearie's his land.

01:57:31.286 --> 01:57:34.455
Those English generals in London,
they're lying.

01:57:35.206 --> 01:57:37.359
They're cowards!

01:57:37.459 --> 01:57:39.402
They're lying. They, they...

01:57:39.502 --> 01:57:41.503
They're just tormenting me.

01:57:45.342 --> 01:57:48.010
It's a lie! It's a lie!

01:57:52.849 --> 01:57:54.850
It's a lie!

01:58:16.039 --> 01:58:19.875
And when she'd finished,
she went quiet and cold.

01:58:21.378 --> 01:58:23.321
Mornings came up...

01:58:23.421 --> 01:58:25.422
noons with their suns.

01:58:26.091 --> 01:58:30.344
Rains came, soft and grey and quiet
across the land.

01:58:31.596 --> 01:58:34.306
But they brought her neither
terror nor hope...

01:58:35.225 --> 01:58:38.018
now that her man had been
murdered for nothing.

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:50.981
Oh, Ewan...

01:59:00.875 --> 01:59:02.501
Ewan?

01:59:04.879 --> 01:59:06.463
Chae.

01:59:08.466 --> 01:59:11.051
Chae... he's not living?

01:59:13.471 --> 01:59:15.472
Ewan's dead.

01:59:21.104 --> 01:59:23.105
Don't vex yourself hoping else.

01:59:37.162 --> 01:59:39.371
They can't hurt him any more.

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:44.209
Even this can't hurt him.

01:59:49.674 --> 01:59:52.342
But I know right well
you should know it, Chris.

01:59:55.263 --> 01:59:57.264
Ewan was shot...

01:59:58.475 --> 02:00:01.852
as a coward and a deserter
out there in France.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.402
You're better always to know
what's truth in a thing.

02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.865
For lies come creeping home
to roost, Chris.

02:00:17.494 --> 02:00:19.495
You're young yet.

02:00:21.539 --> 02:00:23.540
You've hardly begun to live.

02:00:26.753 --> 02:00:30.547
And I swore to mysel' I'd tell you all
so you'd never be vexed with me.

02:00:35.011 --> 02:00:37.763
I'll never be vexed with you
for telling me this.

02:00:40.099 --> 02:00:42.100
It was best.

02:00:44.395 --> 02:00:46.188
It was best.

02:00:51.736 --> 02:00:55.447
Left, left, left, left, left, left, left!

02:00:59.911 --> 02:01:01.912
At the double!

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:05.316
Left, left, left, left, left...

02:01:05.416 --> 02:01:07.584
- Firing party.
- Left, left, left...

02:01:08.753 --> 02:01:10.754
Take aim...

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:13.590
Fire!

02:01:46.249 --> 02:01:48.250
Why did you do it, Ewan?

02:01:51.796 --> 02:01:54.214
You might well have known
you'd never get free.

02:02:01.931 --> 02:02:03.932
I did it for Chris, Chae.

02:02:07.395 --> 02:02:09.229
For Blawearie.

02:02:15.445 --> 02:02:17.654
It's bare a quarter of an hour now, Chae.

02:02:19.407 --> 02:02:22.684
Take aim... fire!

02:02:27.248 --> 02:02:29.917
She didn't even come to kiss me goodbye.

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.340
Chae...

02:02:37.592 --> 02:02:39.593
never said goodbye.

02:02:42.639 --> 02:02:44.514
Oh, man!

02:02:46.643 --> 02:02:48.852
Mind me when you're back at Blawearie.

02:02:51.648 --> 02:02:55.817
And will you look at my lass for me...
when you see her again?

02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:02.240
And you give her that kiss...

02:03:04.702 --> 02:03:06.703
the kiss that I'll never give her.

02:03:14.671 --> 02:03:17.214
And she'll think
I died like the rest of them.

02:03:20.426 --> 02:03:22.177
Don't tell her.

02:03:23.221 --> 02:03:25.180
Please, Chae...

02:03:26.182 --> 02:03:28.183
you're no' to tell my dear Chris.

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.204
Mind that night of the storm, Chae...

02:03:51.499 --> 02:03:53.083
wi' you on horses?

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:55.919
Right?

02:04:02.218 --> 02:04:04.219
That was the night...

02:04:05.096 --> 02:04:07.305
the night that I knew Chris liked me well.

02:04:12.895 --> 02:04:16.440
And the song that she sung, when we wed...

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:20.861
Och...

02:04:24.907 --> 02:04:26.851
What was that song that she sung?

02:04:43.551 --> 02:04:50.474
<i>I've heard the liltin'</i>

02:04:51.225 --> 02:04:56.839
<i>At the ewe-milkin'</i>

02:04:56.939 --> 02:05:02.402
<i>Lassies a-liltin'</i>

02:05:03.071 --> 02:05:09.117
<i>Before dawn o' day</i>

02:05:12.246 --> 02:05:16.666
<i>Now there's a moanin'</i>

02:05:17.043 --> 02:05:22.380
<i>On ilka green loanin'</i>

02:05:23.091 --> 02:05:28.845
<i>The floo'ers o' the forest</i>

02:05:29.764 --> 02:05:36.311
<i>Are a' wede away</i>

02:05:38.106 --> 02:05:44.528
<i>At buchts, in the mornin'</i>

02:05:45.029 --> 02:05:50.534
<i>Nae blythe lads are scornin'</i>

02:05:51.869 --> 02:05:57.374
<i>Lassies are lonely</i>

02:05:57.708 --> 02:06:04.506
<i>And dowie and wae</i>

02:06:06.008 --> 02:06:10.762
<i>Nae daffin', nae gabbin'</i>

02:06:11.597 --> 02:06:17.269
<i>But sighin' and sobbin'</i>

02:06:18.187 --> 02:06:24.093
<i>Ilk ane lifts her leglin</i>

02:06:24.193 --> 02:06:30.365
<i>And hies her away</i>

02:06:57.226 --> 02:07:03.982
<i>There'll be nae mair liltin'</i>

02:07:04.859 --> 02:07:10.197
<i>At the ewe-milkin'</i>

02:07:10.781 --> 02:07:15.869
<i>Women and bairns</i>

02:07:16.412 --> 02:07:23.627
<i>Are heartless and wae</i>

02:07:24.921 --> 02:07:29.799
<i>Sighin' and moanin'</i>

02:07:30.218 --> 02:07:35.305
<i>On ilka green loanin'</i>

02:07:36.098 --> 02:07:41.561
<i>The floo'ers o' the forest</i>

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:48.193
<i>Are a' wede away</i>

02:07:50.738 --> 02:07:55.450
<i>The floo'ers o' the forest</i>

02:07:56.244 --> 02:08:03.667
<i>Are a' wede away</i>

02:08:09.382 --> 02:08:11.383
Oh, Ewan.

02:08:13.261 --> 02:08:15.262
Sleep quiet and sound now, lad.

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:20.350
I understand.

02:08:27.799 --> 02:08:29.800
You did it for me...

02:08:31.696 --> 02:08:33.697
and I am proud.

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:41.871
You did it for me and Blawearie.

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:47.085
My dear, my dear...

02:08:53.384 --> 02:08:55.427
Sleep quiet and brave...

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.890
for I've understood.

02:09:38.888 --> 02:09:40.889
I've come home, Chris.

02:09:54.028 --> 02:09:55.820
I've come home.

02:10:37.905 --> 02:10:41.199
He could fair play, that piper.

02:10:43.244 --> 02:10:47.205
He tore at your heart with the tune
echoing across the loch.

02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:51.501
It rose and rose and wept.

02:10:54.296 --> 02:10:56.297
He played for all those who died:

02:10:57.842 --> 02:10:59.493
Long Rob...

02:10:59.593 --> 02:11:01.579
Chae Strachan...

02:11:01.679 --> 02:11:03.205
and Ewan.

02:11:03.305 --> 02:11:04.973
All of them.

02:11:07.143 --> 02:11:09.352
We had the last of the light up there.

02:11:11.313 --> 02:11:14.190
And maybe we did not need it or heed it...

02:11:15.776 --> 02:11:22.740
but you can do without day if you have
a lamp quiet lighted and kind in your heart.
