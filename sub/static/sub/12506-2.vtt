WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:07.375
[girl] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.408 --> 00:09.377
We actually made it, guys.
Can you believe it!?

00:09.410 --> 00:10.611
Next stop,
Olympic Village!

00:10.644 --> 00:12.480
[screaming, laughing]

00:12.513 --> 00:16.617
One day at this camp is worth
one week anywhere else.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.121
- Lauren, are you OK?
- Back in line!

00:20.154 --> 00:23.291
- I didn't give permission
to stop.
- [Lauren] What's the matter?

00:23.324 --> 00:26.026
- We know you got a letter.
- Max broke up with me.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.664
[McIntire] Tonight you will
say goodbye to your past.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.435
Take off your Rock jackets,
ladies. Toss them in the fire.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.405
- Jordan's your new teammate.
- You do know she's crazy?

00:37.438 --> 00:39.773
She also has a
triple back dismount.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.787
- [air horn blaring]
- [girls shrieking]

00:53.821 --> 00:56.657
[rap music plays]

00:56.690 --> 00:58.359
Rise and shine, rookies!

01:01.061 --> 01:02.330
Get used to it, ladies.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.833
Think this is stressful?
The big O is stressful.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.405
- [groaning]
- [McIntire] Gym in five!

01:11.439 --> 01:12.706
Fish or cut bait, Tanner.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.642
Those gold medals
aren't gonna win themselves.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.179
Don't even think of
plugging in that curling iron.

01:20.848 --> 01:25.353
Was I having a nightmare or has
Jordan Randall crashed the TC?

01:25.386 --> 01:28.756
That was no dream.
She clawed her way in.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.658
And the nightmare is she can do
a triple back dismount.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.659
No way she can
land a triple.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.061
Coach is just trying
to psych us out.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.131
And even if she did have it,
the Jordan I know

01:37.165 --> 01:39.633
will self-destruct before
she gets to the finish line.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.103
I'm so sorry I kept you up
all night whining about Max.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.473
I have got to suck it up.
It's all just such a... shock.

01:45.506 --> 01:49.310
You don't have to apologize.
You'll get over Max.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.744
I couldn't get through
any of this without you.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.781
Well, you won't have to.
Hey...

01:53.814 --> 01:56.284
Bun up, rookie.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.652
This workout is awesome.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.588
There's a study in Belgium
that says exercise pre-breaky

02:00.621 --> 02:04.292
increases muscle mass.
Plus, it's totes bonding!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.694
- [McIntire] Cruz!
- Totes annoying.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.802
Oh my gosh.
Is that Jordan Randall?

02:17.238 --> 02:20.508
- 60.575.
- What?

02:20.541 --> 02:23.344
Her score at the 2008
Junior Nationals when she
won the Best All-Around.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.379
But that was, like, eons ago.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.815
Now she's just an aging gymnast
without a club behind her.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.150
Maybe Coach McIntire
remembers how good she was

02:30.184 --> 02:33.654
when she was young,
but I'd say glue factory.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.590
Excuse me, Strawberry Shortcake.
She's our age.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.766
[girls cheering]

02:45.799 --> 02:46.800
- Good work.
- Nice work, Kaylie.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.373
Congratulations on getting
into the Training Center.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.408
Thanks.
How are your folks?

02:54.442 --> 02:55.843
Good. How's Coach Ray?

02:55.876 --> 02:58.912
- Good.
- Then we're all good.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.815
I think Clipboard Cowboy
has a spy.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.183
How else could he have
known that we were

03:03.217 --> 03:04.718
sneaking out
and breaking curfew?

03:04.752 --> 03:07.288
Everybody better watch it.
We have a narc in our midst.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.189
I have a feeling like
it's Little Miss Sunshine.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.525
One of these little witches
has been blabbing about

03:11.559 --> 03:13.661
outside activities,
and I don't like it.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.296
My Rock jacket
meant everything to me.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.866
I totally get what a bummer that
must have been for you guys.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.668
How exactly
do you "get it?"

03:20.701 --> 03:23.771
You've never been committed to
a real team, much less The Rock.

03:23.804 --> 03:27.908
Thanks, KP... but it's
sort of a Rock girl thing.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.279
- [McIntire] Tanner.
- Great.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.483
Hey. What we have as friends
is forever.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.917
That coach
can't take it away

03:36.950 --> 03:39.820
by burning our jackets
or anything else.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.855
- Together to the big O?
- All the way.

03:41.889 --> 03:42.890
[Kaylie chuckles]

03:50.598 --> 03:52.300
[girls cheering]

03:52.333 --> 03:54.234
First things first.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.505
There's a new girl.
Get used to it.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.674
Second, nobody gets
to the Olympics alone.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.877
Starting today, you'll be
working in pairs.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.648
The girl I put you with
is your other half, your twin.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.752
You'll eat, sleep, breathe and
train with your new partner.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.522
You sink or swim together.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.826
Wendy, say hello to Jordan.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.963
Kaylie, you and Kelly Parker
are together.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.999
Payson, you'll be teaming
with Lauren Tanner.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.902
Now, in addition to being
partners in the gym,

04:28.936 --> 04:32.940
y'all will also be
rooming together. Let's work.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.985
[crowd cheering]

04:50.924 --> 04:52.893
I like this room so much better.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.895
But that's probably
just because you're in it.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.797
I can't figure out
why he did this.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.032
Like, why are we together?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.669
Oh, that's easy.
This is just McIntire's way

05:01.702 --> 05:03.270
of merging the superpowers.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.606
- Meaning?
- Well, we're title holders.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.941
You're the National Champion,
I'm the World Champion.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.910
We're the best of the best.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.479
And then there's
everybody else.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.789
Could be a lot worse than me,
you know.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.956
You could be with
Jordan Randall.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.627
- [scoffs]
- What gives with you two?

05:26.660 --> 05:30.030
Um, we were friends
when we were kids.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.901
Met at Ray Keegan's Rhythmic
Gymnastics Camp in Florida.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.036
I went there every summer,

05:36.069 --> 05:38.839
um, before I switched
to artistic gymnastics.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.942
During the year, we'd e-mail,
make each other playlists...

05:41.975 --> 05:44.111
Come on, give me the dirt.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.415
It was just weird.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.350
All of a sudden,
in our third summer,

05:50.384 --> 05:54.321
she started, um, really
kissing up to the coach.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.656
Those girls are the worst.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.392
Yeah. Soon as she
became his favorite,

05:58.426 --> 06:01.429
she totally iced me out.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.631
Then the coach focused
so much attention on her,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.500
that there was no time
for anyone else.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.472
You know what? I bet she's
the narc. Think about it.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.807
She's already shown
she'll do anything to get in.

06:13.841 --> 06:18.946
- Jordan is actually talented.
- Not as talented as us.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.015
You know what? I say out
with the old, in with the new.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.051
Right on roommate switcheroo.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.527
Please.
No more drive-through.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.897
Sometimes a man just needs
a $3.00 combo meal.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.432
[laughs]

06:38.466 --> 06:42.069
You realize your new plan has
these girls totally freaked out.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.071
Their roommates were their
last comfort zone here.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.707
I'm taking them all apart
to see how best to put them
back together.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.542
But you kept Lauren
and Payson together.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.043
They're from
the same club, right?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.613
Yeah, but I think
Kaylie is the glue.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.382
Take her out of the picture,
and I don't know what happens
to Payson and Lauren.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.150
And I wouldn't want
to find out in London.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.186
No wonder you're dyspeptic.

07:00.688 --> 07:04.892
How is it you always
make big words sound so sexy?

07:04.925 --> 07:08.095
- [laughs]
- Mmm.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.931
- It's a gift, honey.
- [both laughing]

07:10.964 --> 07:12.500
- Mm-mm. Thank you.
- All right.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.172
Sonny and Cher,
Starsky and Hutch...

07:20.908 --> 07:22.676
Batman and Robin...

07:24.177 --> 07:26.446
Bert and Ernie.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.049
Know what all those partnerships
had in common?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.184
They knew how to
make each other look good.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.020
Your first assignment
is to create

07:33.053 --> 07:37.725
a one minute floor
routine showcasing your
partner's strengths.

07:37.758 --> 07:42.029
Your rankings will depend
on how well the two of you
work together.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.097
Whether you love your partner
or hate your partner,

07:44.131 --> 07:47.535
you must trust the partner I
have chosen especially for you.

07:49.102 --> 07:49.937
You're excused.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.677
Remember Randall, you have
one week to knock my socks off

07:56.710 --> 07:59.847
or get sent home.
Clock's ticking.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.156
[exhales]

08:09.189 --> 08:13.093
- [distorted] Hey! Hey, you OK?
- [soft ringing]

08:16.163 --> 08:19.466
Yeah. [deep sigh]
Super duper.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.703
I just need my, uh,
low glycemic twigs and berries.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.138
Breaky?

08:30.043 --> 08:32.580
- [Kaylie laughing]
- You clear for Thursday night?

08:32.613 --> 08:35.082
Oh, why? you taking me
on a fancy date?

08:35.115 --> 08:37.951
[chuckles] A fancy date to
the on-camera commentator class

08:37.985 --> 08:39.620
I signed us up for.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.722
[Kaylie clears her throat]

08:41.755 --> 08:43.490
People are already calling us
"the golden couple."

08:43.523 --> 08:45.826
OK? We're Bart
and Nadia 2.0, baby.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.228
We could have big careers
waiting for us after
the Olympics.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.098
Yeah, I don't know
if I can right now.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.201
I feel like I need to focus,
and I'm stressed and...

08:54.234 --> 08:55.636
Why? What's up?

08:57.971 --> 09:01.742
KP is my new roommate
and training partner.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.778
And I only have two days
to choreograph a routine
to her strengths.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Kelly Parker?

09:07.214 --> 09:10.718
- Yeah.
- You better include some
snake moves in that routine,

09:10.751 --> 09:13.253
cause that KP is one low down,
slippery chick.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.056
Look, I know that
her mom may be nuts,

09:16.089 --> 09:19.259
but KP's
not really that bad.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.194
Have you forgotten that
she stole your journal

09:21.228 --> 09:23.130
and tried to have you
thrown out of the sport?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.698
You're too nice.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.299
You can't trust her,
especially now.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.168
OK? It's clutch time.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.803
I think she's changed.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.272
People don't change,
only their tactics do.

09:32.305 --> 09:36.810
Oh, says my boyfriend
and former skirt chaser.

09:36.844 --> 09:40.313
Uh... the only skirts
I'm chasing now are yours.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.181
Mm...

09:42.249 --> 09:43.917
I'm wearing jeans.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.788
Hey, look who's home!

09:49.189 --> 09:51.558
Um... Can I talk to you
for a minute?

09:51.591 --> 09:55.963
Oh. For you?
Always, roomsie.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.899
[sighs] Um...

09:58.932 --> 10:00.934
Look, I just wanted
to make sure,

10:00.968 --> 10:04.938
after all that's happened
between us, um...

10:04.972 --> 10:07.307
We're all... good, right?

10:07.340 --> 10:08.809
Well... [sighs]

10:11.144 --> 10:14.281
Look, I know I've done some
shady things in the past,

10:14.314 --> 10:16.917
but your friendship
has showed me that gymnastics

10:16.950 --> 10:19.820
is more than
cutthroat competition.

10:19.853 --> 10:23.356
There's a real...
sisterhood in it.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.795
I am so stoked that we're
paired together, Kaylie.

10:27.828 --> 10:32.132
You're right. Um, sorry
for bringing up the past.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.235
That's all behind us.
Now, we're in it to win it.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.874
OK, I have gotta
hit the shower.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.376
- [chuckles] OK.
- [door opens]

10:50.818 --> 10:51.819
[unzips bag]

11:02.395 --> 11:04.397
[indistinct chatter, shouts]

11:16.243 --> 11:19.046
By combining your first two
tumbling passes back to back,

11:19.079 --> 11:21.648
you'll get a high start value
and more time for dance.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.682
Do you have any feedback?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.320
I know some of the ballet moves
are kind of basic,

11:27.354 --> 11:28.856
but before you jump down
my throat, I was thinking...

11:28.889 --> 11:30.157
It's fine.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.959
"Fine?" You're Payson Keeler.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.894
You're, by definition,
never satisfied.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.364
Especially with me.
Hey! We are far from fine.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.866
I've figured out
why we're together.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.134
Because
we're on the bottom.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.270
We're the only two girls who
have gone down in ranking

11:43.303 --> 11:46.006
since being here.
We could be looking at
going home this week.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.975
You better suck it up,
this is game time,

11:48.008 --> 11:50.210
and you and I are stuck
in this game together.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.045
Whatever.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.214
"Whatever?"

11:59.386 --> 12:01.454
[panting]
Umm...

12:01.488 --> 12:04.224
...ending with a triple
turn into a Popa?

12:04.257 --> 12:07.060
That's, um... That's
kind of simple, isn't it?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.829
Oh, well, I...

12:10.130 --> 12:12.199
Your triple turn
into the Popa and Shushunova

12:12.232 --> 12:15.803
will get you more bonus points
than the longer leap series
you were doing before.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.805
This routine highlights
your beautiful lines.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.407
And instead of throwing
every trick in

12:20.440 --> 12:22.242
and risk falling because
it's too packed,

12:22.275 --> 12:24.277
you can focus on
what you do best.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.413
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean,

12:26.446 --> 12:30.717
- I guess it makes sense, but...
- Trust me. It does.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.286
- Do you have mine?
- Yeah...

12:35.088 --> 12:38.358
[exhales]
You really are a baby g.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.195
- Gangster?
- Gymnast.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.233
OK, not this.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.401
I'll do this.

12:48.435 --> 12:53.140
Move this here...
and we're good.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.975
This is what I'm doing, OK?

12:55.008 --> 12:56.409
I've only got a week
to prove myself here,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.511
and I know what
I'm good at. Cool?

13:02.850 --> 13:05.518
Starting with a double twisting
front punch front is huge.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.354
It'll make a lasting impression.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.390
Is it too hard?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.260
It's perfect for me.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.395
Are you sure?
Because it is hard.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.065
But I can help you, or
maybe take it down a notch?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.400
No, no.
I love it.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.770
Um... And I don't
need any help.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.207
Um... I'll run through it
a couple of times on my own.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.476
- I'm solid.
- OK.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.019
Mind your
own business, snoopy.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.387
I know you're the mole here,
Jordan.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.223
And pretty soon everybody else
is going to figure it out, too.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.125
Why didn't you admit
to your teamie

13:45.158 --> 13:46.826
that you don't have
the skills for the combo?

13:46.860 --> 13:52.465
[laughs] Oh, wait, it's because
you want to be her bestie.

13:52.499 --> 13:56.269
Not her weak,
pathetic little gym project.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.938
You can chase the Rock girls
all you want,

13:57.971 --> 14:00.473
but you will never
be one of them.

14:00.507 --> 14:04.244
See, I know Kaylie. And just
let me tell you from experience,

14:04.277 --> 14:07.280
she'll stab you in the back
first chance she gets.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.355
What the hell is going on
with Payson? She's catatonic!

14:15.388 --> 14:17.824
- Just give her time, Lo.
- There is no time.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.060
Our Olympic dream is on the
line every freakin' second.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.929
I'm not being pulled down
by poopy Payson.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.997
Look, Payson has
been through a lot.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.366
I don't think she ever got over
that thing with Sasha.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.535
Then Max drops
a nuclear bomb on her.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.371
She's trying to compete
after being completely
humiliated

14:31.404 --> 14:33.506
in the romance
department... again.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.344
Well I know the remedy for that.
She just needs a replacement.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.513
- A replacement what?
- A replacement boy.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.116
Oh, no.
You have got to be kidding.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.052
Look, I know Payson a little
better than you do.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.587
She's not good with boys,
and even worse with
distractions.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.890
So, please, promise me you're
not gonna try and hook her up.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.493
She's already in bad shape,
and that could sink her.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.129
OK, I promise.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.468
[mid-tempo pop music plays]

* So can you turn it up?
Turn up the fun *

15:07.040 --> 15:10.177
* Let the good times roll
for everyone *

15:10.210 --> 15:12.645
* Can you turn it up...

15:12.679 --> 15:14.481
It's your lucky day, stud.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.383
One of my dearest friends,
Payson Keeler,

15:16.416 --> 15:17.951
is in the market
for a new BF.

15:17.985 --> 15:23.223
She's funny, warm, very hot,
and you are the perfect match.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.458
[gasps] I mean,
you're captain of the judo team.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.696
And you have dimples!
[exhales]

15:33.500 --> 15:38.138
So, you're Ivy League,
a Scorpio, hot for blondes...

15:39.306 --> 15:40.974
You know what?
Forget my friend.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.044
That's my cell.
Don't be a stranger.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.180
You guys are bikers, right?

15:47.214 --> 15:50.550
I'm Lauren Tanner. Full-time
gymnast, part-time matchmaker.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.584
I'm Brad. This is...

15:51.618 --> 15:55.488
Rigo, your grungy sidekick.
I'm familiar.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.690
Miss Congeniality.
I missed you.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.960
Braddykins, I have
the most fantastic girl

16:00.994 --> 16:04.531
who's currently boyfriend-less,
which is such a pity.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.498
Now, you can change
all that

16:05.532 --> 16:07.600
if you play
your cards right.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.970
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing, she's just shy.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.540
Yeah, that usually means
hit with the ugly stick.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.443
No way. My girl is gorgeous,
warm and...

16:16.476 --> 16:18.478
Oh, well,
that's her right there.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.317
Hey, I met her at the
welcome party. She is hot.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.187
I didn't know she was
the Healthy Bar girl.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.590
Does she have paparazzi?
Because that would be awesome.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.026
Ah, you're going to have to
meet her at Coffee Cart

16:33.060 --> 16:34.627
in the quad tomorrow
at three to find out.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.029
Done deal.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.031
Oh, and she can never find out
this was a set-up.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.467
No problem. I got game.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.503
That's why I picked you
out of all the other guys
on the campus.

Check please, Chuck E. Cheese.

16:55.148 --> 17:00.120
Yo, amigo, leggo my ego.
The chicken is in the pot!

17:02.189 --> 17:03.390
What do you think?

17:03.423 --> 17:06.159
I need the best
Austin Tucker signature phrase

17:06.193 --> 17:07.494
for our
sportscasting class.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.298
I can't possibly decide.
They're all so...

17:12.232 --> 17:14.134
...original?

17:14.167 --> 17:17.337
Hey, where are yours?
Our assignment's due tomorrow.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.771
I haven't started yet.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.608
I've been pretty busy
working with KP, so...

17:21.641 --> 17:22.642
How's it going?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.646
KP gave me a really
simple routine.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.381
Babe, this is serious.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.217
When are you going
to start listening to me?

17:31.418 --> 17:33.186
Do you remember
Bryce Riggins?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.255
No.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.157
Do you remember a guy
named Ben Feltz?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.759
Yeah, of course. He won
the all-around at Worlds.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.028
Riggins was supposed to take
all-around at Worlds,

17:42.061 --> 17:45.298
but he spent the summer here,
at the TC, rooming with Feltz,

17:45.332 --> 17:47.234
who convinced him to get rid
of his uprise double back.

17:47.267 --> 17:51.138
Feltz made it his mission to con
Riggins into playing it safe.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.173
Riggins kept it simple,
went soft,

17:53.206 --> 17:55.775
now he's managing
a Big 5 in Decatur.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.679
That chicken is in the pot.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.359
What's wrong?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.462
I never would have put
my tumbling combination

18:15.495 --> 18:16.729
with a dance move ending.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.599
It's ten times better
than what I was doing before.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.534
It'll clean up the landing.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.836
Plus, I added a Shushunova
to your two and a half twist.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.506
You can even dance out of that,
all Lauren sassy pants.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.707
And get even more bonus points.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.142
How did you come up
with this for me?

18:29.176 --> 18:31.378
I've only been watching you
for, like... years.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.746
I know your strengths. We just
never worked together before.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.348
But you were so bummed out.

18:35.382 --> 18:39.452
How were you were able to focus
on me and come up with all this?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.222
That's what you do on a team.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.123
I sucked it up, for you,

18:44.157 --> 18:45.592
because I knew you were
counting on me.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.296
Right. Are you ready
to work on yours?

18:50.597 --> 18:53.333
I actually need to
take a five. Is that OK?

18:53.366 --> 18:54.367
Yeah.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.874
Attention, ladies!

19:04.811 --> 19:07.280
Apparently, Randall
needs more attention.

19:08.848 --> 19:12.118
You know what? Since your
teammate hasn't mastered
listening skills,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.854
you can all stay for an extra
hour of conditioning today.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.924
- Hit the line. Wind sprints.
- [all groan]

19:22.662 --> 19:24.631
Coach, can I
use the bathroom?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.665
Three minutes.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.870
Hey, Rigo!

19:32.272 --> 19:35.675
I need you to tell Brad that
his date's been changed to 4:00.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.577
Got it Mrs. Smith.
I'll tell Mr. Smith

19:37.610 --> 19:39.412
there has been a hitch
in the secret plan.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.813
Don't joke, this is important.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.815
Oh and remind him
this is on the down low.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.251
She can't find out
it's a set-up.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.553
Tell him to just
bump into her or something.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.455
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:53.293 --> 19:58.265
- Wait, Kaylie,
I have a present for you.
- A present?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.300
I was thinking we could
perform our routines in them.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.936
Our own team leos.
Go, team us!

20:03.970 --> 20:07.307
Wow. They're almost matching.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.377
Well, and I know that pink
is technically your
signature color,

20:10.410 --> 20:11.578
but we have
the same skin tone

20:11.611 --> 20:13.280
so it'll look great
on the both of us.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.816
And, FYI, it's custom.
Just like all your leos.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.351
How'd you get
my measurements?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.886
I just looked
in your duffle bag,

20:19.919 --> 20:21.721
and got the info
off one of your leos.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.792
- Thanks...
- Yeah, anytime.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.994
- I'll see you at home.
- Mm-hm.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.566
What an amateur.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.869
One 300 dollar leo will never
buy the love of a Rock girl.

Champion Cruz.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.844
Listen, you gypsy
gymnast jerkface.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.514
You better back
the hell off or else.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.021
[crowd cheering]

21:00.893 --> 21:03.796
I'd do some extreme sports
with that guy.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.832
[cheering continues]

21:16.343 --> 21:17.344
Whoo!

21:21.381 --> 21:22.649
Hi.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.453
Are you talking to me?

21:32.792 --> 21:36.729
- Thanks for the mocha.
- Thanks for hanging out.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.998
So what exactly was that
you were doing on your bike?

21:39.031 --> 21:41.568
360 bunnyhop with
a squeaker tailwhip.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.538
Well, almost. That's what
I thought I was gonna do.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.374
Man without a plan?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.609
The plan was for you
to have coffee with me,

21:49.642 --> 21:51.611
so maybe man without
an exact science,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.613
but there was indeed a plan.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.815
I practically had to
light myself on fire

21:55.848 --> 21:59.018
- to get you to look up.
- [phone vibrating]

22:01.988 --> 22:03.823
Your friend can't make it?

22:03.856 --> 22:05.692
Lucky us.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.463
- [both] Otis!
- [laughs]

22:10.497 --> 22:12.865
The wrestlers always end up
with that dude and all the luck.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.536
This year, the BMX team is gonna
ambush them at the last minute.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.472
Oh, we already got punked
trying to steal him
on the first week here.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.874
- They called us Barbies.
- [laughing]

22:21.908 --> 22:23.476
They think
we're little girls.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.678
I only see empowered women.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.549
[clears throat] I should
get back to my dorm.

22:29.582 --> 22:33.620
Oh no, it is the time for
the second part of my plan,

22:33.653 --> 22:34.954
giving you a ride home.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.957
Oh. Uh...

22:37.990 --> 22:41.928
It's safe. No squeaker tailwhip.
I promise.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.696
Maybe that's what I'm into.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.032
Really?
You're a tailwhip girl?

22:46.065 --> 22:48.435
- I'm a tailwhip woman.
- Oh.

22:48.468 --> 22:51.471

22:53.973 --> 22:56.809
* A bad dream

23:00.680 --> 23:03.750
* I'll whisper
"Things aren't *

23:03.783 --> 23:06.919
- * What they seem"
- [cheering]

23:09.922 --> 23:13.826
* Wake up and I am here

23:14.994 --> 23:19.832
* Wake up and I'm right here

* And when you
can't escape the rain *

23:29.008 --> 23:34.547
* I'll make you
colorful again *

23:38.618 --> 23:42.722
* Stay under my umbrella

[screams]

23:44.724 --> 23:47.660
* What'd I tell ya? *

23:57.637 --> 23:59.005
No fainting spells?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.107
Increased heart rate?
Sweaty palms?

24:01.140 --> 24:02.174
Anything out of
the ordinary?

24:02.208 --> 24:04.477
Negatory. I'm tip-top.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.479
You were right, it was
the blood sugar after all.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.914
Fiber is a miracle.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.483
That's good. I'd hate to
pull you out of training.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.485
I'm gonna go ahead
and cancel that body scan

24:12.519 --> 24:13.986
I had scheduled for you.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.524
Thanks, I really appreciate
your concern.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.691
I'll see you soon.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.527
I want to keep a close watch
on any deviations.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.461
I'll let you know
about the tiniest thing.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.530
[chuckles]

24:36.543 --> 24:39.478
[deep sigh] It's so ugly.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.015
Deets on your date, stat.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.050
It wasn't a date,
it was...

24:45.518 --> 24:48.220
- It was magic.
- [laughs]

24:48.254 --> 24:51.123
- Oh, hey stranger.
- I gotta get a refill.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.661
Wind sprints and cute boys
are dehydrating. [chuckles]

24:54.694 --> 24:58.731
I set Payson up with this hottie
and, bingo, she's all better.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.068
I know, I'm a genius.
[laughs]

25:02.101 --> 25:04.737
I guess I know Payson
better than you.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.205
You do know how bad
this could be for Payson

25:06.238 --> 25:07.540
if it all goes south, right?

25:07.574 --> 25:09.576
It's not gonna happen.
What could go wrong?

25:09.609 --> 25:13.613
- It's a boy. And Payson.
- [sighs]

25:13.646 --> 25:16.716
So, Kay, what's up?
We haven't seen you in like...

25:16.749 --> 25:17.950
- Forever.
- [both chuckle]

25:17.984 --> 25:21.654
Well... Austin wants me
to take this stupid class

25:21.688 --> 25:22.822
that I don't want to do.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.256
It's not like my plate
isn't full already.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.993
So bail.
This is your career.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.029
You need to take care
of you here, not Loverboy.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.265
You're right. Yeah.

25:33.299 --> 25:36.535
I have to tell him. I'll do it
tonight before the class.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.271
It's just so hard
to say no sometimes.

25:39.305 --> 25:42.609
And... there's this
other thing...

25:44.076 --> 25:47.513
- KP got us matching leos.
- She did not.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.281
I think it's kind of sweet.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.885
She went into my bag
and got the size out of
one of my other leos.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.287
I repeat,
she went into my bag.

25:55.321 --> 25:56.723
- Scarytown.
- [Payson] Yeah.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.958
The last time KP was in your bag
she stole your journal.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.061
And the worst part is
the stupid leo has the...

26:02.094 --> 26:05.632
- Three quarter sleeves?
- Oh, you hate those!

26:05.665 --> 26:07.867
It's not my fault
my forearms are hairy.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.136
- [all laughing]
- Aw...

26:10.169 --> 26:13.806
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stop it. [laughing]

26:16.676 --> 26:17.710
I'm outta here.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.350
You eating that?

26:29.756 --> 26:30.857
Cool.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.998
What do you like better?

26:40.667 --> 26:42.068
Bang goes the drum...

26:43.269 --> 26:44.270
...or...

26:45.371 --> 26:47.707
Feed me nails
and call me Rusty?

26:47.740 --> 26:50.677
That doesn't even make sense.
Who's 'Rusty'?

26:52.311 --> 26:54.080
Why can't you
take this seriously?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.782
- [laughing]
- It's really important.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.851
Austin, why does this whole
thing matter so much to you?

26:58.885 --> 27:01.220
It's just distracting us
from training.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.692
What's wrong?

27:06.358 --> 27:07.927
Tell me.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.164
I lost the Kobalt endorsement.

27:12.198 --> 27:16.168
They didn't hire "boyfriend
guy." They hired a player.

27:16.202 --> 27:20.707
It's because you're with me?
Austin, I...

27:20.740 --> 27:22.875
Hey. Don't even think
like that.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.878
I'd give up a lot more
than that to be with you.

27:27.747 --> 27:28.815
But now I'm a little
short of dough,

27:28.848 --> 27:33.185
and I really need
this thing. OK?

27:33.219 --> 27:34.220
OK.

27:40.860 --> 27:45.297
The most important thing is
to connect with your audience.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.701
I'll run copy on the
teleprompter, and presto,

27:48.735 --> 27:51.704
you're all gonna have a demo
tape as your calling card.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.841
Now let's start things off
with the golden couple,

27:54.874 --> 27:57.276
You two really could

27:57.309 --> 28:00.412
make broadcasting a career
after the Olympics.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.081
Come on, you're up.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.288
And three, two, one,
you're on.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.991
[Kaylie] Thanks everyone for
joining us at the World Cup

28:12.024 --> 28:14.693
in New York City.
I'm Kaylie Cruz.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.364
And I'm Austin Tucker.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.332
This city... um...

28:20.366 --> 28:22.234
Sorry. Can I just
start it again?

28:22.268 --> 28:23.669
- [whispering] Keep going.
- OK...

28:23.702 --> 28:25.337
[trailing off]
This city never...

28:25.371 --> 28:27.439
- [beeps]
- This city...

28:27.473 --> 28:29.942
- [beeps]
- This city never
sleeps, Kaylie.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.778
And it usually
doesn't tumble either.

28:31.811 --> 28:35.414
But today there'll be
plenty of that going on

28:35.447 --> 28:38.417
in Madison Square Garden as
the best gymnasts in the world

28:38.450 --> 28:41.387
turn this town
upside down.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.223
- [slap]
- [clears throat]

28:44.256 --> 28:46.959
- Yo, amigo, leggo my... ego.
- [beeping]

28:46.993 --> 28:50.429
- Yo, amigo, leggo my eggo.
- [beeping]

28:50.462 --> 28:53.800
[Kaylie] So come on inside
where you'll find 15

28:53.833 --> 28:57.203
of the world's best gymnasts
fight for their chance at glory.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.740
- [clears throat]
- Bang goes the drum.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.442
Great.

29:06.278 --> 29:10.249
Kaylie, clearly you have a
future in this if you want it.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.751
I'd like to make a call
to ESPN for you.

29:12.785 --> 29:13.519
Excuse me.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.257
Steven Lang, you're up.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.148
We should go to the practice mat
and work out that move together.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.083
It took me a long time
to get it, too.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.385
I so have it.
I have no idea why I bailed.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.519
I did it like
a hundred times earlier.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.422
What's so entertaining?

29:50.456 --> 29:52.424
If you've done
the two and a half twist

29:52.458 --> 29:54.026
punch front
a hundred times,

29:54.060 --> 29:56.262
it should only take you
a few more times to land it.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.832
We can wait. I'm sure
Kaylie wants to see it.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.503
Hey. I designed
your whole opening

30:04.536 --> 30:05.872
around that one big skill.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.473
Tell me where
you're really at.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.946
Look, sometimes it hits
and sometimes it just...

30:19.285 --> 30:21.387
- I don't have it.
- [scoffs]

30:21.420 --> 30:24.523
Why would you lie to me?
Our rankings depend on this.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.092
We have to perform
this tomorrow.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.427
- Our butts are on the line!
- I am really close,

30:28.460 --> 30:29.461
and I always come through
in a clinch.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.796
Because that's
what winners do.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.498
And you and I
are winners, girl.

30:55.321 --> 30:59.158
Hey, hot stuff, if I'd known you
were going to the showers,

30:59.191 --> 31:01.460
I'd have loaned you
my bubble gum shower gel.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.964
Trust me, boys love
to smell a girl

31:04.997 --> 31:06.465
who's practically edible,
and you're meeting

31:06.498 --> 31:08.901
your new love muffin
this afternoon.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.602
Oh! Want me to
help you get ready?

31:10.636 --> 31:12.972
I'm good.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.912
Is this your dad's
Old Spice?

31:21.413 --> 31:23.849
That's it. I'm helping you,
I don't care what you say.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.884
I have just the lipstick
to wow this guy,

31:25.918 --> 31:28.921
and a top that will
look mad sexy on you.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.590
Come on! Let's go.

31:32.959 --> 31:36.862
Hey, I looked for you
after class, but...

31:36.895 --> 31:38.530
I had to go see the trainer.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.866
My shoulder was acting up.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.203
Being the oldest guy
on the team sucks.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.405
And now that broadcasting
isn't in my future...

31:46.438 --> 31:48.975
You don't need broadcasting.

31:49.008 --> 31:53.312
You're gonna bring home
Olympic gold.

31:53.345 --> 31:58.550
You have more talent than
anyone I have ever known.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.487
Don't give that class
a second thought, babe.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.223
You're nobody's show pony.

32:04.256 --> 32:08.660
You're a gold medalist stud.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.463
Thank you.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.400
I'm just calling it
like I see it.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.434
Not for that.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.638
For not making fun of me.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.643
Bang goes the drum, honey.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.588
Ta-da!

32:36.622 --> 32:38.957
Wow, you're...
You're sort of a wizard.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.092
And I have a skirt
you can wear, too.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.660
I should stick to pants, I'm
probably gonna be on a bike.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.296
I thought Brad
would have a car.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.365
Brad? Brad who hit on me
at the mixer?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.601
Didn't you say
his name was Brad?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.670
No, his name is Rigo.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.473
Rigo?! That little tweaker
in the knit cap?

32:54.506 --> 32:57.476
- It was supposed to be Brad!
- Who's Brad?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.747
You set this
whole thing up?!

33:03.382 --> 33:05.384
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

33:05.417 --> 33:07.419
That's how you thank me,
you crybaby!?

33:07.453 --> 33:09.955
[shrieks] Oh, let's just
humiliate Payson again.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.590
That's your idea
of a good time?

33:11.623 --> 33:13.259
Get out of my business,
and out my life!

33:13.292 --> 33:16.362
It's not my fault the wrong guy
showed up! Blame him, not me!

33:16.395 --> 33:17.663
You're right.
It's both your fault!

33:17.696 --> 33:19.331
I'm done with both of you.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.100
- [grunts]
- [shrieks]

33:21.133 --> 33:22.634
And for the record,
I'm nobody's charity date!

33:22.668 --> 33:24.736
- Yes, you are!
- [screaming]

33:32.010 --> 33:34.446
I don't know what Lauren gave
you to go out with me, mister,

33:34.480 --> 33:37.015
but you should give it back
because this joke is over.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.485
Forget everything
I said to you.
You're a jerk!

33:39.518 --> 33:41.653
Please, you gotta
let me explain.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.390
Yes, Lauren did manipulate
this set-up,

33:44.423 --> 33:46.024
but it was with
my friend Brad.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.393
I'm way ahead
of you there, genius.

33:47.426 --> 33:52.030
Payson, the first time I saw you
last week at the bonfire,

33:52.064 --> 33:53.165
I was knocked out.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.766
I tried asking
Lauren about you,

33:54.800 --> 33:56.402
but she thought
I was hitting on her.

33:56.435 --> 34:00.172
And when this opportunity
came up, I had to take it.

34:00.206 --> 34:03.008
I kicked Brad out of the
equation to be with you,

34:03.041 --> 34:04.310
and I'd do it again.

34:04.343 --> 34:07.646
Even if it was only for
that one ride yesterday.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.815
But I hope
it's for more than that.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.419
You tricked your friend
to get a date with me?

34:13.452 --> 34:16.088
He's not
good enough for you.

34:16.122 --> 34:19.791
I think there's only one guy
here good enough for you.

34:20.792 --> 34:21.793
Me.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.733
Do you have any idea
what you look like right now?

34:29.101 --> 34:30.769
[laughing]

34:30.802 --> 34:33.472
Here. Here, I got this.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.809
And, just so you know,

34:37.843 --> 34:41.713
Lauren didn't give me
anything except the chance

34:41.747 --> 34:45.484
to meet one of the fieriest
babes I've ever come across.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.187
And for that...

34:48.220 --> 34:49.821
...I'm grateful.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.167
Let's get
one thing straight.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.136
I don't need you manipulating my
social life or anything else.

35:04.170 --> 35:09.275
Just try and be a rational,
non-invasive human being
for once.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.409
And one more thing.

35:13.279 --> 35:16.182
Thanks... for however
you got this to happen.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.150
Because he is great.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.851
- Really?
- Really times a hundred.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.620
OK, so... deets
on your date?

35:21.653 --> 35:24.256
Yeah! Yes, yes, yes.
OK, so...

35:27.826 --> 35:29.161
Teamie! We're gonna be late!

35:30.662 --> 35:32.164
Have you seen my sweatshirt?

35:37.769 --> 35:38.804
Oh.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.614
Let's do this.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.722
Here's how it goes down today.

35:56.755 --> 35:59.258
I take everything into account,

35:59.291 --> 36:01.293
the way you've
performed all week

36:01.327 --> 36:03.161
and the routines
you're about to do

36:03.195 --> 36:05.197
designed by your partner.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.199
You'll both be ranked
together today.

36:07.233 --> 36:10.168
And, when we're done,
I'll be cutting two more girls.

36:12.271 --> 36:16.275
I'm sorry, were you expecting
"Warm and Fuzzy Camp?"

36:16.308 --> 36:18.677
This is cutthroat.
You think that Chinese team

36:18.710 --> 36:20.679
is going to cut you slack
in London?

36:20.712 --> 36:22.248
Well, they're not.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.354
I got it.

36:28.387 --> 36:32.324
Up first, Lauren Tanner
and Payson Keeler.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.493
OK, keep your rotation
clean in the air,

36:34.526 --> 36:37.162
and don't lose your shimmer
on your turn sequence.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.230
And bring it, sister.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.268
[up-tempo dance music plays]

36:52.578 --> 36:55.681
* I love speed
I'm gonna try this *

36:55.714 --> 36:59.217
* Give me keys
I'll get behind it *

36:59.251 --> 37:02.454
* Steal your heart
right on this highway *

37:02.488 --> 37:05.624
* Fear me not
I am the driver *

37:05.657 --> 37:06.958
* Pump it

37:08.660 --> 37:12.331
Thank you. For being my partner
and making me look good.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.499
Ditto.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.635
Now get out there and kill it.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.437
* No brakes

37:25.644 --> 37:28.847
* Let's roll it up
let's take a chance *

37:28.880 --> 37:32.351
* They haven't lost
track of time *

37:32.384 --> 37:35.487
* Let's roll it up
under the rug *

37:35.521 --> 37:39.391
* Could be the trip
of your life *

37:42.428 --> 37:45.230
* I've got to find it

37:45.263 --> 37:48.266
* On my feet
Everybody start jumping *

37:48.300 --> 37:51.470
* Check my...
It's good to want it *

37:51.503 --> 37:54.373
* I'll make it pop...

37:54.406 --> 37:56.775
Jordan Randall
and Wendy Capshaw.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.011
OK, so, I thought
about it more,

38:00.045 --> 38:02.681
and I'm gonna do the
routine you created for me.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.352
- You are?
- It was a little outta my zone,

38:06.385 --> 38:10.756
but I thought about it and
I realized, you are pushing me.

38:10.789 --> 38:11.790
And that's good.

38:15.394 --> 38:18.263
* Let's roll it up
let's take a chance *

38:18.296 --> 38:21.533
* They haven't lost track
of time *

38:21.567 --> 38:24.870
* Let's roll it up
under the rug *

38:24.903 --> 38:28.440
* Could be the trip
of your life *

38:34.913 --> 38:37.549
[chuckles] You gave me
solid material, baby g.

38:41.086 --> 38:44.556
* Let's roll it up
under the rug *

38:44.590 --> 38:47.793
Next, Kelly Parker
and Kaylie Cruz.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.502
This is not her routine.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.471
- I didn't think so.
- Nope. Not at all.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.612
Why'd you add
the longer leap series?

40:13.645 --> 40:16.482
To save our butts. If you
couldn't land the big move,

40:16.515 --> 40:17.449
I had to do it
for the both of us.

40:17.483 --> 40:19.417
[McIntire] These are
the new team rankings.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.520
Team number one:

40:21.553 --> 40:23.522
Atchinson and Demeritt.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.124
Team number two:
Tanner and Keeler.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.394
Team number three:
Capshaw and Randall.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.798
Team number four:
Conway and Evans.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.867
Team number five:
Cruz and Parker.

40:35.901 --> 40:39.838
Team number six:
Dillon and Henniford.

40:39.871 --> 40:43.041
And finally, Lee and Leparte.

40:44.643 --> 40:45.711
Come with me.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.483
That'll be all for today.

40:51.517 --> 40:54.419
Wait, it's been a week,
what about me?

40:54.452 --> 40:58.557
Well, you're still on the board,
Jordan. I guess you're staying.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.727
- [sighs] Yes.
- Excuse me, Coach McIntire.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.795
How is it possible that my
ranking dropped on the board?

41:03.829 --> 41:08.099
I had more skills then anyone in
my routine, and it was flawless.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.034
KP!

41:12.237 --> 41:14.205
What in the hell
were you two thinking?

41:14.239 --> 41:18.744
Were you or were you not
listening when I said
this was a trust exercise?

41:20.111 --> 41:21.513
Miss Parker here
was too afraid

41:21.547 --> 41:22.681
to show any weakness
to ask you for help.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.584
And, Kaylie Cruz, you did
yourself a huge disservice

41:25.617 --> 41:28.987
by not trusting the
choreography your partner
designed for you.

41:29.020 --> 41:33.058
It was simple, clean,
and played to your strengths.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.760
No Rock girl could've
designed it better.

41:36.895 --> 41:40.231
I suggest the two of you
learn to trust each other,

41:40.265 --> 41:41.933
or take up lawn bowling.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.574
Why didn't you
ask me for help?

41:48.607 --> 41:49.575
Why didn't you trust me?

41:49.608 --> 41:51.109
I designed a good routine
for you.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.944
Because your track record
for trust is crap.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.113
Can't you see that I'm trying
to put that behind me?

41:55.146 --> 41:57.649
Doesn't what the
coach just said about
my choreography prove it?

41:57.683 --> 41:59.250
I want the best for you.

42:00.886 --> 42:03.589
Yeah, I guess it does.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.094
- [laughter]
- [indistinct chatter]

42:12.798 --> 42:14.532
And I realize
that I can't compete

42:14.566 --> 42:16.868
with Lauren and Payson
for your friendship,

42:16.902 --> 42:19.838
but I was so excited to be
paired with you, Kaylie,

42:19.871 --> 42:22.708
and I was so bummed
you didn't feel the same way.

42:24.576 --> 42:25.744
I'm sorry.

42:28.279 --> 42:30.649
I got it in my head
that I couldn't trust you...

42:33.719 --> 42:34.820
...and then once I did that,

42:34.853 --> 42:37.022
that's how I saw
everything you did.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.725
You designed
a killer routine.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.260
I couldn't see it.

42:43.829 --> 42:48.299
Just promise me, from now on,
you'll ask me for help.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.868
Because that's
what friends do.

42:51.837 --> 42:54.039
And Payson and Lauren
are not perfect,

42:54.072 --> 42:56.675
far from it,
and neither am I.

42:56.708 --> 42:59.945
What makes us a team
is that we share everything.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.682
And I'm sorry about
not wearing your leo.

43:03.715 --> 43:06.351
I, um... I just hate
three quarter sleeves.

43:07.753 --> 43:08.987
- [clears throat]
- Why?

43:09.020 --> 43:10.588
[groans]

43:10.622 --> 43:13.659
- I can trust you, right?
- Yes.

43:15.026 --> 43:17.562
Yeah, you don't want to
get that stuck in spandex.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.598
- No.
- No. [laughing]

43:21.800 --> 43:23.702
- [Lauren] No way!
- [laughing]

43:23.735 --> 43:27.038
OK, from now on, I promise
to tell you everything.

43:27.072 --> 43:29.274
The good and the bad
and the ugly.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.977
It's you and me Kaylie...
all the way.

43:32.010 --> 43:35.647
Yup, you and me, girl.
All the way.

43:35.681 --> 43:36.748
[mid-tempo pop music plays]

43:36.782 --> 43:38.717
* Because what goes up
must come down *

43:38.750 --> 43:42.620
* When I crash and burn
I turn it around *

43:43.689 --> 43:46.792
* Turn it around
Around *

43:46.825 --> 43:49.728
* I took a hit, knock me out
