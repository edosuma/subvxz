WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:04.874
[cell phone vibrating]

00:08.834 --> 00:11.011
[grunting]

00:11.098 --> 00:13.361
It's mine.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.798
[grunting]

00:17.887 --> 00:19.802
[Rigsby yawns]

00:19.889 --> 00:20.846
Rigsby.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.413
[clears throat]

00:22.500 --> 00:25.503
Oh, hey. Yep.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.505
You got it, boss.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.767
We're up.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.204
- Lisbon?
- Yep.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.902
Oh, no. No, she's gonna
call here next.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.992
- She'll know. Get out.
- Grace, wake up.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.863
How is Lisbon gonna know
I'm with you, hmm?

00:37.950 --> 00:39.604
Right, yeah.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.304
[cell phone ringing]

00:43.391 --> 00:45.436
Leave it.
Mm, no.

00:45.523 --> 00:47.438
- No.
- Get out.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.136
Get out.
Get out.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.140
Agent Grace Van Pelt.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.793
Hi, boss. What's up?

00:56.621 --> 00:59.059
Mm-hmm. Alright.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.452
[cell phone ringing]

01:05.152 --> 01:07.806
Bosco, and to what do
I owe this pleasure?

01:07.893 --> 01:09.112
You're up.
Where are you at?

01:09.199 --> 01:10.635
[Jane]
'Crime scene. Why?'

01:10.722 --> 01:12.246
Coffee run?
Usual for you, boss?

01:12.333 --> 01:15.640
Tall drip, black.
We need to talk.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.948
- About what?
- Come see me when you get back.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.602
Okay. Look forward to it.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.301
Hey, either of guys
heard from Hicks yet?

01:24.388 --> 01:25.737
No.

01:25.824 --> 01:29.045
Morning. Well, almost morning.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.699
[female #1]
'Good morning, everyone.'

01:30.786 --> 01:34.094
We got a Caucasian male,
50's. Gunshot to the head.

01:34.181 --> 01:37.706
[Cho]
'And tastefully garnished with
an explosion of yellow roses.'

01:37.793 --> 01:40.230
Security guard saw the body,
called Sac PD

01:40.317 --> 01:43.451
but this is a state cemetery,
which is why we're here at, uh..

01:43.538 --> 01:44.713
...Oh-dark-thirty.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.150
Swell spot.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.499
[Cho]
'Check out the stippling.'

01:48.586 --> 01:50.632
'Looks like he was, uh,
shot at close range.'

01:50.719 --> 01:52.329
Yep. And fibers in the wound

01:52.416 --> 01:54.940
indicate clothes were
removed postmortem.

01:55.027 --> 01:57.421
- Hmm.
- What?

01:57.508 --> 01:59.031
You smell nice.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.772
- Is that lilac soap?
- Yeah.

02:00.859 --> 02:03.297
- You got something, Jane?
- Uh, yes, I do.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.647
- Uh, he's naked.
- Let me write that down.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.649
Well, it makes him look
kinda sad, don't you think?

02:07.736 --> 02:09.129
Vulnerable.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.479
- 'A little comic, even.'
- Meaning what?

02:11.566 --> 02:13.263
He was posed like this.
He wasn't just dumped here

02:13.350 --> 02:14.830
willy-nilly.
This is a statement.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.049
Doctor, the mark on
the hand, is that a burn?

02:17.137 --> 02:20.923
Looks more like
a freezer burn, actually.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.186
- Oh.
- Oh?

02:23.273 --> 02:24.622
That explains it.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.537
His liver temp is 45 degrees

02:26.624 --> 02:28.887
'but it's only around
58 in here.'

02:28.974 --> 02:31.716
So, somebody froze
his body in that position

02:31.803 --> 02:34.197
then dumped him here.
Could be a signature.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.417
Maybe a serial pattern.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.114
Lisbon and I will talk
to Bosco about that.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.290
See if he has any
similar incidents.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.465
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.597
Let forensics
do their thing.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.905
You smell lovely.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.516
What is that?
Is that lilac?

02:50.039 --> 02:52.868
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.957
[Jane]
It's pretty.

03:02.356 --> 03:05.576
[Jane]
'Morning, Rebecca. They look
good. One of those for me?'

03:05.663 --> 03:08.536
You know, it's alright to like
me now. Your boss and I made up.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.668
It's okay, Rebecca.
I don't like him, either.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.757
She's a liar.
She loves me.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.369
'Yeah, keep tellin'
yourself that.'

03:15.456 --> 03:16.587
[screaming]

03:19.024 --> 03:20.287
[Lisbon]
'Oh, my God!'

03:20.374 --> 03:22.680
Oh, my God. No.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.292
[Lisbon]
'Sam! Sam!'

03:27.772 --> 03:28.904
He's gone.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.518
- No pulse.
- 'Dyson's dead too.'

03:34.605 --> 03:37.260
[Lisbon]
'Jane, some help?
Get over here, now!'

03:40.132 --> 03:42.526
[Lisbon]
'Press as hard as you can.
Right, right there. There!'

03:42.613 --> 03:43.919
This is Special Agent Cho

03:44.006 --> 03:45.703
we've got agents
down on the fifth floor.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.792
[Lisbon]
Two, three, four..

03:47.879 --> 03:49.838
[Cho]
'Yes, inside the building.'

03:49.925 --> 03:51.666
We're in lockdown
on my authority.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.668
I have three agents down.
I need EMT's.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.148
'Roll SWAT, Sac PD
and CHP, and have them set'

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
up a perimeter.
Suspects may still be here.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.978
Just lock this
place down now!

04:02.764 --> 04:05.897
[Lisbon]
'Five, six, seven,
eight, nine'

04:05.984 --> 04:08.378
'ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen..

04:10.511 --> 04:12.904
[theme music]

04:20.738 --> 04:22.479
[instrumental music]

04:27.789 --> 04:29.181
[Lisbon]
'Hicks? Bosco?'

04:29.269 --> 04:31.445
Bosco, Hicks.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.403
Stealing major crimes' food.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.667
Violation of penal code
section 484, I believe.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.975
- It didn't have a name on it.
- Uh, this one does.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.063
It's mine.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.412
It's from Cornaro's.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.458
Mm.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.851
Meatball sub's really
their best thing.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.550
You better hope I don't tell
Mandy you went off your diet.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.595
She's in New Hampshire
with her sister all week.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.990
Ah, there you are.
Agent Hicks, your form 41's.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.079
And, boss, the attorney
general's office called about

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
the Armenian cartel thing.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.648
And you better hope
I don't tell your wife

05:00.735 --> 05:02.563
about you going
off your diet.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.176
[gags]

05:11.746 --> 05:13.225
Breathe, breathe.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.358
Come on.
Breathe, breathe.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.143
I got this.
Clear!

05:19.841 --> 05:22.278
Okay, he's back.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.324
[male #1]
'He's bleeding out.
What do we got?'

05:24.411 --> 05:26.282
[female #2]
'There's no breath sounds
on the right side.'

05:26.369 --> 05:28.415
- His pulse is really weak.
- Run IV wide open.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.894
We're code 3.
Let's move.

05:32.288 --> 05:35.596
[indistinct chattering]

05:35.683 --> 05:36.814
You okay?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.296
What do we got?

05:40.383 --> 05:41.819
Lockdown's in full effect,
building-wide.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.473
Same with
the capitol and the DOJ.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.388
Good, Cho's liaising
with the Sac PD

05:45.475 --> 05:47.085
they're setting up
a 2-block perimeter, now.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.826
Nobody gets in or out.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.175
All civilians
are being sent

05:50.262 --> 05:52.047
to the downstairs'
lobby for holding.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.354
SWAT's on their way up. We're
gonna do a sweep room by room.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.573
- Suspects could still be here.
- Get with security.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.967
Check all the camera footage
and set up teams to interview

05:59.054 --> 06:01.491
all of the guards, janitors
and everyone down in the lobby.

06:01.578 --> 06:02.710
You got it.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.409
[Lisbon]
'He's gone. Go on now.'

06:10.065 --> 06:11.675
Jane?

06:11.762 --> 06:14.635
You may be in shock.
Look at me.

06:14.722 --> 06:18.029
There should be three bodies.
There-there's only two.

06:18.116 --> 06:22.033
- Where's Agent Hicks?
- I'll get Cho on that.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.907
Lisbon, maybe we should
just wash up first.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.430
'Come on.'

06:28.779 --> 06:29.911
Come on.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.091
[water splashing]

06:40.356 --> 06:42.750
[intense music]

06:56.111 --> 06:58.461
[splashing continues]

07:01.377 --> 07:02.683
So, you never saw
Hicks this morning?

07:02.770 --> 07:04.728
No, I haven't seen
him since yesterday.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.122
And yesterday
was he angry or upset?

07:07.209 --> 07:10.908
You think Marlon Hicks
could have done this? Oh, no.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.476
We have to check
every angle, Rebecca.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.826
Let's back up.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.262
[Lisbon]
'When you went out
to get the coffee'

07:17.349 --> 07:19.264
did you see
anything unusual?

07:19.351 --> 07:21.049
Somebody who didn't
belong here, maybe?

07:21.136 --> 07:23.921
No. Everything was fine.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.401
It was normal.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.146
'God, I'm sorry.
I'm not helping.'

07:31.233 --> 07:34.062
Um, uh, I was gone
maybe ten minutes

07:34.149 --> 07:36.978
and I, I-I didn't
see anything weird.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.241
Bosco called the team in early
this morning, do you know why?

07:39.328 --> 07:41.504
Well, I thought that maybe it
was the Armenian cartel arrests.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.595
You werethatclose
to making an arrest?

07:45.682 --> 07:49.643
Y-yeah, um, uh, there was,
um, a break this week.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.732
Um, an informant came
through, the boss said.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.778
It was something about,
um, um, um, a warehouse.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.606
[Jane]
'Uh, Lisbon.'

07:56.693 --> 07:58.478
Did forensics come up with
an ID on the frozen man?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.088
I haven't checked in with them.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.698
It's not really
a priority right now, okay?

08:01.785 --> 08:04.048
Okay. I guess.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.097
- You were saying?
- Camera four, also nothing.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.882
- Just an ordinary day.
- Weird, huh?

08:11.969 --> 08:13.754
- These guys are like ghosts.
- Yeah, no kidding.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.582
We checked the building top to
bottom. There's no sign of them.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.758
BFS are dusting every
stairwell and door for prints

08:17.845 --> 08:19.673
but it'll take days
to go through 'em all.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.284
Lisbon said I should see
if you needed a hand here.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.025
Jimmy, go to
camera five now.

08:24.112 --> 08:27.202
[Grace]
'Lobby entrance,
same time code.'

08:27.289 --> 08:29.421
That's Rebecca coming back.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.076
She was gone nine minutes.
30 altogether.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.600
[Rigsby]
'I don't recognize
hat guy here.'

08:33.687 --> 08:35.340
Put him on the list
of people to check out.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.647
Okay, Jimmy, camera six.
The garage entrance.

08:37.734 --> 08:38.822
Mm-hmm.

08:38.909 --> 08:44.393
Hang on.
Something's screwed up here.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.351
Some files are corrupted
on this data drive.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.223
Um, that's not possible.
Our firewalls--

08:48.310 --> 08:49.746
Have been breached.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.575
Camera six and seven.
That's the garage.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.490
[Grace]
'They were disabled remotely.'

08:54.577 --> 08:56.100
Looks like at least
a 30 minute gap.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.406
Which means we have
no way of knowing

08:57.493 --> 08:59.060
who went in or out
via the garage.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.452
Jimmy, get somebody
from IT down here now.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.976
Figure out what
we're dealing with.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.978
Okay, I-I'll tell my boss.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.897
Ten minutes.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.942
It was all over
in ten minutes.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.778
Okay, got it. Thanks, Avila.
I owe you one.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.958
Agent Lisbon,
I spoke to the governor.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.439
I told him that I have
my best team on this one.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.963
- I know you'll do us proud.
- Thanks, boss.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.922
I just reached out
to Sac PD narcotics

09:35.009 --> 09:36.401
about that
Armenian drug cartel that--

09:36.488 --> 09:38.403
In a minute.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.494
I just got word
from the hospital.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.323
- He's not dead?
- No. No, Bosco's in surgery.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.239
But I wanted you
to prepare yourself.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.764
His injuries are
extensive.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.070
'Critical.'

09:53.157 --> 09:55.899
Teresa, I'm, uh, I'm sorry
to ask this, but I need to know

09:55.986 --> 09:58.249
that you're gonna be able
to go on with this case

09:58.336 --> 09:59.337
'no matter what happens.'

09:59.424 --> 10:01.731
If-if you can't,
just let me know

10:01.818 --> 10:03.167
and I'll put
someone else on point.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.735
Not necessary.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.477
You think Sam Bosco's gonna
let a little lead stop him?

10:08.564 --> 10:10.261
Please.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.089
I hope you're right.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.308
Good luck.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.267
Nothing on Hicks.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.182
I had a uni run by his house,
he's not there.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.141
- No car in the driveway.
- I've got something.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.317
You know that
Armenian drug cartel that Bosco

10:22.404 --> 10:26.016
was close to nailing? It's run
by a guy named Michael Assanian.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.061
Oh-ho, bad guy.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.410
Outside of the Mexicans

10:28.497 --> 10:30.151
biggest heroin distributor
on the west coast.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.675
Bosco must've spooked him. He
left the country three days ago.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.329
So, maybe he leaves town
to keep himself clean

10:34.416 --> 10:35.983
while his people kill Bosco.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.202
Yeah, makes sense.
Kill the team, kill the case.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.508
It's worth checking out.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.379
Lisbon, did we get
an ID on the man

10:41.466 --> 10:42.554
from the cemetery yet?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.252
What's with you and this case?

10:44.339 --> 10:45.645
Oh, it's just a feeling.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.211
You think it's
connected to Bosco?

10:47.298 --> 10:49.300
- Maybe.
- 'How?'

10:49.387 --> 10:52.782
- Hard to say, I..
- Fine. Cho, call it up.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.654
'Forensics might have
posted something by now.'

10:54.741 --> 10:56.438
- Thank you.
- Run down this informant.

10:56.525 --> 10:57.874
See if he's got anything for us.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.397
Lauro in narcotics said
you could use his name.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.703
Yeah, will do.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.052
Forensics says cemetery guy's

11:02.139 --> 11:03.097
'fingerprints belong to'

11:03.184 --> 11:04.359
'a Dr. Towlen Morning'

11:04.446 --> 11:05.839
'age 55, Stockton.'

11:05.926 --> 11:07.057
Towlen Morning.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.714
Jane?

11:13.020 --> 11:14.195
Cho, with me.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.505
[instrumental music]

11:48.708 --> 11:51.101
[music continues]

12:18.738 --> 12:21.131
[music continues]

12:48.768 --> 12:51.161
[music continues]

12:56.036 --> 12:57.951
Oh, no.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.170
Hicks.

13:04.696 --> 13:07.090
[heavy breathing]

13:19.363 --> 13:21.235
How did you know
it was Red John?

13:21.322 --> 13:22.932
Towlen Morning was
the family doctor

13:23.019 --> 13:25.500
for Janet
and Carter Peak.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.719
Peaks were Red John's
third and fourth victims.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.852
Carter presumed
to be the fourth.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.723
They never
found his body.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.464
That was nine years ago.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.162
Why attack the CBI today?

13:35.249 --> 13:36.859
Yeah, it's puzzling.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.513
I'm Red John,
why do I kill Morning

13:38.600 --> 13:40.863
and Hicks
and attack Bosco's team?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.822
[Jane]
Carter and Janet Peak.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.346
Nine years ago.
Carter and Janet peak. Nine.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.783
Nine years ago,
I'm a lot less experienced.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.397
Something went wrong with Carter
and Janet Peak. A mistake.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.704
And he fixed it, but somehow
now, it's come undone.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.446
Hicks came to see
the doctor for a reason.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.621
He was checking
something out.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.057
Red John killed him for it.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.319
Killed them all.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.626
Except for Bosco, I mean.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.236
Bosco had a lead in the Red John
case.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.282
Cho, go inside,
check the doctor's files

14:08.369 --> 14:09.936
for Carter and Janet Peak.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.895
X-rays, labs, everything.

14:12.982 --> 14:16.116
Why did Bosco want
the medical reports?

14:16.203 --> 14:18.205
What did he know?

14:18.292 --> 14:20.120
He's in ICU
in a medically induced coma.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.556
He's not gonna
tell us anything.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.472
- I know. I know.
- The case files will.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.998
Van Pelt, have BFS
search Bosco's office

14:29.085 --> 14:31.479
for any new evidence
or notes in the Red John file.

14:31.566 --> 14:35.526
And you and Rigsby start working
with the secretary, Rebecca.

14:35.613 --> 14:36.701
Mm-hmm.

14:42.185 --> 14:44.579
[instrumental music]

14:56.896 --> 15:00.073
Hey, boss.
Nothing from Rebecca.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.683
The BFS techs are
still taking apart

15:01.770 --> 15:03.293
Bosco's office, but so far--

15:03.380 --> 15:04.904
- Is Jane back?
- 'I haven't seen him.'

15:04.991 --> 15:06.818
- Find him, would you?
- Yeah.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.560
[Minelli]
'Special Agents
Nick Martinez and Mark Dyson'

15:09.647 --> 15:12.607
'died at the scene here.'

15:12.694 --> 15:14.304
And Special Agent Marlon Hicks

15:14.391 --> 15:18.265
was found dead
at a secondary crime scene.

15:18.352 --> 15:22.486
Special Agent Samuel Bosco
remains in critical condition.

15:22.573 --> 15:25.141
We are devoting every resource
to this investigation.

15:25.228 --> 15:28.753
And I promise, I promise
the agents' families

15:28.840 --> 15:31.626
we will not rest..

15:31.713 --> 15:34.324
...till we bring
the perpetrator to justice.

15:34.411 --> 15:37.197
Special Agent Minelli,
our condolences.

15:37.284 --> 15:40.940
Would you describe your
feelings at this terrible time?

15:41.027 --> 15:44.247
Wow, Meredith, that..

15:44.334 --> 15:46.249
You media guys,
that's just dis..

15:50.384 --> 15:52.386
You know, for eight years

15:52.473 --> 15:55.128
I've put up with the idiotic
questions of the media

15:55.215 --> 15:57.782
and I've never said squat.

15:57.869 --> 16:02.570
But today, I must
tell you, Meredith..

16:02.657 --> 16:06.748
...you've really set a new
standard in horse's assery.

16:10.186 --> 16:16.062
You people have
no conceptof what we do.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.934
We go into dark,
horrible places

16:19.021 --> 16:22.111
alone and afraid

16:22.198 --> 16:23.852
'and we do it with no money'

16:23.939 --> 16:26.376
with broken-down vehicles with..

16:26.463 --> 16:28.988
...computers that have
more viruses than a $10 whore.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.427
How? Good people.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.649
And I lost three
good people today

16:38.736 --> 16:40.912
and a fourth who's
in critical condition

16:41.000 --> 16:43.393
and you ask me
how I'm feeling.

16:45.482 --> 16:48.181
I'm feelingsad..

16:48.268 --> 16:50.835
...you...moron.

16:54.796 --> 16:55.927
Any other questions?

16:58.974 --> 17:02.499
Okay, then.
Good day to you.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.371
Elizabeth, carry on.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.898
Virgil.

17:11.508 --> 17:14.250
Horse's assery? Nice.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.686
They shouldn't
have done that.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.993
Hey, you told them the truth.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.212
I did.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.562
Felt good.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.045
Stick with us, boss.
We need you.

17:26.132 --> 17:29.309
Okay. Yes.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.832
I gotta run. You got this?

17:31.572 --> 17:32.747
Go.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.059
[indistinct chattering]

17:48.763 --> 17:49.938
Evening, gentlemen.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.645
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.344
- You are?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Uh..

18:04.431 --> 18:06.911
Patrick Jane, CBI.
I'm a friend of his.

18:06.998 --> 18:10.306
- 'Uh, how's he doing?'
- He's not good.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.265
The next two days
should tell us a lot.

18:12.352 --> 18:15.659
Oh, he was in such pain.
Is he getting enough morphine?

18:15.746 --> 18:16.834
He should be.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.796
Looks good. Call me if
you need anything else.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.754
Will do. Thanks, doc.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.330
[Lisbon]
'What are you doing?'

18:36.419 --> 18:38.247
Unplugging his morphine.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.858
I'd ask a doctor to do it, but
I think I know what they'd say.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.470
- Are you crazy?
- 'Yes.'

18:43.557 --> 18:45.776
That's exactly
what they'd say.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.996
They wouldn't understand
the moral imperative here.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.348
Bosco is the only person

18:52.435 --> 18:55.351
that can tell us what
he found on Red John.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.224
And he may die,
we need to wake him up

18:58.311 --> 19:01.879
and have him tell us everything
he knows while he still can.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.360
[machine beeping]

19:11.280 --> 19:13.108
- Y-you can't do that.
- Why not?

19:13.195 --> 19:14.892
Morphine doesn't
make him any better.

19:14.979 --> 19:18.374
- It just stops the pain.
- Yes, that's what it does.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.334
Pain is nothing.
Pain means he's still alive.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.988
We need him now,
Lisbon.Now.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.729
He's useless to us
when he's dead.

19:25.816 --> 19:30.430
- Shut up! He's gonna live.
- Maybe and maybe not.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.432
- God, you're a cold bastard.
- Oh, please.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.217
Y-y-you need
to think logically.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.176
He would want
us to do this.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.787
How could you know what he would
want? You don't even know him.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.790
But you do, if he had
to suffer pain to stop Red John

19:42.877 --> 19:46.097
he would do that. You know
that he would. You know that.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.665
What's all the commotion?
What the..

19:48.752 --> 19:50.145
Did you touch that machine?

19:51.755 --> 19:52.930
No.

20:00.677 --> 20:03.158
[Minelli on TV]
'Good people.'

20:03.245 --> 20:07.075
And I've lost three
good people today..

20:08.990 --> 20:10.687
[Grace]
'Is Lisbon with you?'

20:10.774 --> 20:11.949
No.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.344
What's going on?

20:15.431 --> 20:18.304
We got a hit...on Bosco's
cell phone records.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.914
Just before the attack
Bosco called a cop

20:20.001 --> 20:22.438
down in Cloverville,
not far from Stockton.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.310
Cop told me when they
tore down an old strip mall

20:24.397 --> 20:26.660
last week, they found a body
buried in the foundation.

20:26.747 --> 20:27.791
Body?

20:27.878 --> 20:29.053
The cop who posted the bulletin

20:29.140 --> 20:30.316
said he got a call from Bosco

20:30.403 --> 20:31.752
saying he'd go
and check it out.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.536
What body?

20:33.623 --> 20:35.146
This one.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.410
Cloverville PD
e-mailed a copy of the x-rays.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.238
John Doe, 30's.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.589
See here? His head was
almost cut off. Vicious.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.940
- Then there's this.
- What's that?

20:46.027 --> 20:48.072
- 'His leg.'
- He's missing a leg?

20:48.159 --> 20:50.292
The coroner told the cop
it was not part of the attack.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.077
A much earlier amputation,
he said. Distinctive.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.210
The files we got from
Dr. Morning's office

20:55.297 --> 20:57.081
this matches an x-ray
we found there.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.736
Carter Peak.
Carter Peak, retired army

20:59.823 --> 21:01.999
lost his right leg
during the First Gulf War.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.566
They found the missing
Red John victim.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
Better still.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.744
This is Red John's mistake.

21:07.831 --> 21:11.008
This is it. He made
a mistake and this is it.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.371
[Jane narrating]
Killing Carter Peak
wasn't Red John's MO.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.416
He was a man who was
killed with his wife.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.244
His body was removed
from the scene.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.855
It is unlike any of Red John's 14 other murders.

21:31.942 --> 21:34.684
Maybe, Carter
returned unexpectedly

21:34.771 --> 21:36.338
maybe, there was a struggle.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.905
[Jane]
'So, Peak's body resurfaces.'

21:37.992 --> 21:41.735
Red John hears about it somehow,
and it upsets him.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.955
A, how does he
hear about the body?

21:45.042 --> 21:47.697
Off the bulletin, I guess.
It was statewide.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.004
And B, why does it upset him?

21:50.091 --> 21:51.745
There's evidence on
Carter Peak's body.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.181
That's why he tried
to make it disappear.

21:53.268 --> 21:56.489
Damning evidence, like DNA.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.186
We gotta get to Cloverville.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.105
The cement matrix preserved
the body remarkably well.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.194
We were able to run
a full DNA crime kit.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.457
Hair, skin under
the fingernails, etcetera.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.329
We need someone
sitting on this place 24/7

22:10.416 --> 22:12.287
until we can move
the body up to Sacramento.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.038
Whoops.
Uh, my bad.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.826
Wow!

22:29.913 --> 22:31.524
That's weird.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.614
Yeah, it is.
Where's the body, doc?

22:34.701 --> 22:37.007
Uh, let me,
let me check the log here.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.798
Okay, you guys
gotta get your signals

22:44.885 --> 22:46.669
straightened up in Sacramento.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.541
CBI already picked up
the body night before last.

22:48.628 --> 22:49.846
- CBI did?
- Yeah.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.196
Night shift logged it,
right here.

22:52.283 --> 22:55.461
California Bureau
of Investigation, an Agent Rojo.

22:55.548 --> 22:56.853
The body, samples.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.681
Uh, everything we had,
it looks like.

22:58.768 --> 22:59.943
See for yourself.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.512
Arrived at 2:15 a.m.
with a meat wagon.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.166
The night before the CBI attack.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.473
I can get you photos, though.
We usually keep a set.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.431
But the crime scene kit,
the DNA samples..

23:09.518 --> 23:11.651
- What about the DNA?
- Well, I'm telling ya.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.783
I-it should have all gone with
your guy. That's procedure.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.655
He wasn't our guy.
Red John?

23:15.742 --> 23:17.221
Call in your night shift person.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.136
I-it's important that we get
an idea of what this, uh..

23:19.223 --> 23:20.790
...Agent Rojo looks like.

23:24.533 --> 23:25.621
