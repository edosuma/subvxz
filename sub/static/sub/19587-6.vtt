00:02.167 --> 00:03.933
Previously on
Sun Records...

00:04.000 --> 00:05.500
Your dream.

00:05.567 --> 00:08.300
This is what
I have to do!

00:08.367 --> 00:11.233
Becky, I will die
in Birmingham.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.667
And I will die here.

00:13.733 --> 00:15.967
A little piece of this,
a little piece of that,

00:16.033 --> 00:17.033
before you know it,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.533
you got yourself an empire.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.533
And I think you might just be
the perfect partner.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.067
It's time for us
to be together.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.267
We love each other.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.000
I'll tell her Saturday night.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.400
Sam and me are gonna
have another baby.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.167
-Country is built on bets.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.100
Does every bet pay off?
'Course not.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.400
Everybody hits
a losing streak,

00:43.467 --> 00:46.367
but, my God,
this one is endless.

00:46.433 --> 00:49.933
If Arnold or Snow knew,
they'd pass out laughin'.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.800
They don't see
how cheap their talent is.

00:53.867 --> 00:57.467
Talent hits a target
that any fool can hit.

00:58.167 --> 00:59.833
But genius...

00:59.900 --> 01:03.633
Genius hits a target
that no one else can see.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.667
That's who
the Colonel's after.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.167
How to get out of this hole?

01:11.233 --> 01:14.200
Easy, sugar.
How much you in for?

01:14.267 --> 01:16.867
-$1,200, compounding.
-Ooh!

01:16.933 --> 01:20.500
I heard a guys'
gettin' rubbed out
for less than a grand.

01:20.567 --> 01:23.700
You know what?
You should try prayer.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.767
Bet on God?

01:28.833 --> 01:30.367
You should try it.

01:30.433 --> 01:33.067
My papa,
he was going into foreclosure.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.800
He prayed, two weeks later,

01:35.867 --> 01:38.667
he sold 200 acres
of useless bottom land

01:38.733 --> 01:42.400
to the federal government
for that interstate highway.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.900
$1,500!

02:32.533 --> 02:34.767
Pick 'em up at your local
Easy-Way Food Store.

02:34.833 --> 02:36.900
Give 'em to the kiddies
after school

02:36.967 --> 02:38.900
-and they'll be...

02:38.967 --> 02:41.867
...poppin' with energy
till supper.

02:41.933 --> 02:44.067
EasyPop popcorn!

02:49.867 --> 02:51.267
Thanks for the gig, Sam.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.233
Yeah.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.600
Whoa! Fellas.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.733
Hold your horses.

03:10.167 --> 03:12.467
Sam, I got a beer
with my name on it.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.167
Now, look here, fellas,

03:14.233 --> 03:17.200
I got Memphis's finest guitar

03:17.267 --> 03:19.733
and bass thumpers right here.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.967
-That Gibson sounded hot.

03:22.067 --> 03:24.600
It just so happens
we have a couple of hours
on the clock.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.167
Aw, Sam, come on, now!

03:26.233 --> 03:27.800
Union contract.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.267
This could be
the greatest song

03:29.333 --> 03:31.067
in all of the universe,
but you ain't gonna know it

03:31.100 --> 03:33.433
-with me or him singing it.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.500
Hmm.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.900
Marion!

03:37.967 --> 03:40.333
Who do we know
that can carry a tune?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.167
And get his ass down
here on the PDQ.

03:43.233 --> 03:44.800
This here's a hit song.

03:44.867 --> 03:47.933
We get it soundin' real good,
we'll pitch it to Red Foley.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.367
Presley.

03:51.433 --> 03:53.133
Yup, he's here.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.867
Boy.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.067
Uh, hello?

04:02.467 --> 04:04.700
Yeah.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.200

What's the matter?

04:13.267 --> 04:16.700
I'm gonna get on
the records for real, Mama.

04:16.767 --> 04:18.733
Honey, I ain't
a bit surprised.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.467
You did so good
on the little record.

04:20.533 --> 04:23.833
Don't get took, son.
We ain't got another
four bucks.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.533
-Oh, Daddy,
if you get on records,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.067
they pay you.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.133

04:37.200 --> 04:38.500
You forgot this.

04:44.733 --> 04:46.200

Where'd you get it?

04:50.367 --> 04:53.200

Becky called.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.767
Gave me a list of names
for your baby.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.533
She wants to know what I think

05:20.600 --> 05:23.600
-because I'm such
a trusted family friend.
-I'm not late, am I?

05:27.633 --> 05:29.067
Howdy, Mr. Phillips.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.567

for singin', son.

something fresh off the press
from Mr. Sam Phillips.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.600
Oh, boy, it's still warm.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.433
Smells like a hit.
Don't know who it is

13:07.500 --> 13:08.933
'cause ain't nothin'
on the label.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.967
Thank for that, Sam.
All right.

13:11.067 --> 13:14.433
Well, let's take
a little listen.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.900
♪ Blue moon

13:19.967 --> 13:22.100
♪ Blue moon

13:22.167 --> 13:23.833
-* Blue moon

13:23.900 --> 13:26.100

13:26.167 --> 13:27.367

13:38.733 --> 13:40.467

Well, darn if I know.

13:40.533 --> 13:41.700
Elvis Presley.

13:41.767 --> 13:43.833

13:43.900 --> 13:47.067
Alvin Presney, boy, go get it.

13:47.133 --> 13:50.633

14:24.800 --> 14:27.200
Elvis! Where are you?

14:28.067 --> 14:29.333
Elvis!

14:30.767 --> 14:33.100
Oh, sorry, sorry.

14:33.167 --> 14:34.567
Elvis!

14:37.300 --> 14:39.933
-Elvis!
-Yes, Marion?

14:40.067 --> 14:41.533
Your record's on the radio.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.167
Elvis,
what is going on?
-I'm on the radio?

14:43.233 --> 14:44.333
I need you
to come with me now.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.767
-I'm on the radio!
Elvis!

14:45.833 --> 14:46.833
Sorry.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.567
Shh!
-Uh, sorry, sorry.

14:48.633 --> 14:49.833
-I'm on the radio.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.733
Now, don't say
nothin' dirty

14:51.800 --> 14:54.233
and don't stop talkin' for
even a heartbeat. You got it?

14:54.300 --> 14:55.467
Mention the name
of your high school

14:55.533 --> 14:56.867
so they'll know you're white.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.133
Good people, old Elvis Presley
now just come in here.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.233
Elvis, son,
you either got more relatives
than anyone I ever knowed,

15:08.300 --> 15:11.967
or you got the
number-one record in Memphis!

15:12.067 --> 15:14.400
Where are you from, son?

15:14.467 --> 15:16.533
Uh... Uh, Tupelo, Mississippi.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.233
Me and my folks
come up the fall of '48.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.733
Now, where'd you go to school?

15:22.300 --> 15:24.633
Humes.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.333
We give three cheers
for those happy years
at Humes High.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.800
-Great.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.800
What're you doin' now,
'sides makin' hit records?

15:32.867 --> 15:35.500
Uh, well,
I drive for Crown Electric.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.933
Figure they gonna be shocked
to find out

15:37.067 --> 15:39.700
they got a recordin' star
haulin' for 'em?

15:39.767 --> 15:41.067
Well...

15:45.200 --> 15:48.500
Good people,
this is Elvis Presley.

15:48.567 --> 15:51.200
Now you gotta
listen to him, boy.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.067
Now it's time for
news and weather.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.600
You need to get this fella
on the road, cuz.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.767
Make this record
a dad-blamed hit!

15:56.833 --> 15:58.600
You hear that?
Get your toothbrush,

15:58.667 --> 16:01.233
get your shorts,
tell Mama and Papa
we're goin' on the road.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.733
Come on, we got a lot to do.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.700
Thank you, Mr. Phillips,
I really enjoy your show.

16:04.767 --> 16:07.567
Don't let the door hit you
where the Good Lord
split you, son.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.700
Dewey, man, I could kiss you.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.367
This is the one.

16:11.433 --> 16:13.933
This is where it
all starts goin' right
for Sam Phillips.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.633
About damn time, too.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.067
Yes, sir, good people,
that was Elvis Presley.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.733
Now, this is gonna be
the number-one record

16:22.800 --> 16:25.433
in Memphis for a long time,
I can tell you, boy.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.067
This is our office?

16:31.133 --> 16:34.333
I put up a heap of dough
to pay your dues at the
Sharecroppers Club?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.533
A proper office costs
three times as much, okay?

16:36.600 --> 16:39.067
I'm here, you're here,
we're doin' business,

16:39.067 --> 16:40.900
what's your problem?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.700
You're not yourself today.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.800
See if we have any checks.

16:52.733 --> 16:55.133
Well, this must have
come to the wrong address.
It says,

16:55.200 --> 16:57.400
"Andreas van Koo-eee..."

16:57.467 --> 16:59.100
Something or other.

17:00.733 --> 17:04.667
Van...van Kuijk?
That's for me.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.467
Who you know
in the Netherlands?

17:06.533 --> 17:08.500
Someone was talking to me
about a tour.

17:08.567 --> 17:10.867
Oh, Amsterdam? Tour? Really?

17:10.933 --> 17:13.467
Yes, uh, but their money
can't leave the country.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.533
We'd have to take payment
in cheese and clogs.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.933
-I gotta go.
-What? You just got here.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.233
We gotta talk about the tour.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.500
You said that Opry
wasn't paying enough...

17:21.567 --> 17:23.333
Look, all of that
can wait for now.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.800
Uh, Rayford,
give Mr. Snow a drink.

17:27.867 --> 17:29.233
Okay.

17:32.833 --> 17:36.333
Dearly beloved...
-And spawns of Satan.

17:37.267 --> 17:38.933
Genesis tell us

17:39.067 --> 17:42.800
that God put Adam
in the Garden of Eden

17:42.867 --> 17:47.433
and the Lord God
calls the deep sleep
to come up on Adam,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.767
took a rib from his side

17:49.833 --> 17:53.167
and created
the first woman, Eve.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.167
And intended
for her to marry Adam.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.800
Not the serpent.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.533
And Adam said,

17:58.600 --> 18:01.067
"This is now bone of my bones

18:01.100 --> 18:02.833
"and flesh of my flesh."

18:02.900 --> 18:04.367
Okay,
now you're sure

18:04.433 --> 18:06.067
the interstate highway
goes through here.

18:06.067 --> 18:09.700
The surveyor was
there last Tuesday
marking the field.

18:09.767 --> 18:12.467
-That's a moneymaker.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.300
Cole, just the man
I wanted to see.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.367
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

18:15.433 --> 18:16.967
The money.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.600
Well, that's precisely what
I want to talk to you about.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.200
Now, look, I can pay you
double what I owe you

18:20.267 --> 18:22.067
in 90 days
if you just extend...

18:22.067 --> 18:23.600
Am I hearing straight?

18:23.667 --> 18:24.867
I came here
to collect from you,

18:24.933 --> 18:26.067
not loan you a damn dime.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.800
Yeah, but I got a bead
on a land deal.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.167
How about if I bury you in it?

18:32.233 --> 18:34.267
Oh, God!

18:35.800 --> 18:36.900
All right.

18:41.067 --> 18:43.367
This is all I got.

18:43.433 --> 18:46.700
-That puts me current.
-Yeah. I'm gettin' real tired

18:46.767 --> 18:49.233
of chasin' you down
for "current."

18:54.367 --> 18:55.867
Don't believe that
we've been introduced.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.067
Cole Dillard,

18:57.133 --> 18:58.433
business associate
of the Colonel's.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.633
Freddie Sampson.
Bureau of Land Management.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.467
-Bureau of Land Management?
-That's right.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.067
Mmm.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.067
I've been in
this business several years.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.400
First radio, then records.

19:13.467 --> 19:18.067
I have seen 'em come and go,
but I have never

19:18.133 --> 19:20.067
seen an artist

19:20.067 --> 19:22.667
with the potential
that I've seen in Elvis.

19:24.267 --> 19:27.067
Now it's time for us
to form a team.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.867
To get him where he can go.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.733
This means
I need the two of you,

19:32.800 --> 19:35.067
after all the boy's only 19,

19:35.067 --> 19:39.100
to sign this Sun Records
exclusive contract.

19:39.167 --> 19:41.067
Let's get this ball rolling.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.600
Mr. Phillips says
we gotta go on the road.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.133
I don't know.
That Dewey fella's

19:45.200 --> 19:48.067
already playin' Elvis
every night on the radio.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.467
And now it's time to get him

19:49.533 --> 19:52.467
on more stations
across the country.

19:52.533 --> 19:55.367
What does he make for being
on the radio like that?

19:55.433 --> 19:58.067
Nothing. That's promotion.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.400
What's he make
for goin' out on the road?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.433
It doesn't work that way.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.500
Gotta sell records
to make money.

20:04.567 --> 20:06.967
What about managing?
What's that pay?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.667
I could manage him myself,

20:09.733 --> 20:12.767
I've been doin' it
19 years anyway.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.867
Manager gets
a part of the fees.

20:15.933 --> 20:19.267
But you just said there
wasn't any fees, Mr. Phillips.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.600
Sounds like the boy's gettin'

20:20.667 --> 20:22.900
the short end of the stick
on this deal.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.767
Mr. Presley,

20:24.833 --> 20:26.467
I have faith,

20:27.167 --> 20:29.733
unlimited faith,

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
in Elvis.

20:31.733 --> 20:34.200
More than you can imagine.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.700
But it all takes time.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.533
However,

20:39.600 --> 20:41.867
if you're not happy,

20:41.933 --> 20:45.200
maybe we should all go
our separate ways.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.800
Part friends as they say.

20:49.233 --> 20:50.533
Is this what
you want, pumpkin?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.233
Oh, more than anythin', Mama.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.600
Now, hold on.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.100
It's important
that Mr. Presley

20:55.167 --> 20:56.467
is good with everything.

21:21.900 --> 21:25.733
You just take real good care
of our boy, you hear me?

21:28.367 --> 21:30.400
Like he was my own, sir.

21:35.467 --> 21:36.967
You and Jimmy
have got to get right,

21:37.067 --> 21:39.633
so I invited him here
for the Youth Day Fellowship.

21:39.700 --> 21:43.333
-He's a good man and family.
-Mmm.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.367
Now, after you graduate,

21:45.433 --> 21:46.933
should we stay
with Jimmy and Daddy

21:47.067 --> 21:50.967
in the Assemblies of God
or maybe go Church of Christ?

21:51.067 --> 21:52.933
Oh, we don't gotta
decide right now.

21:53.067 --> 21:56.500
Once we're established,
we could start our own flock.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.667
How many children do you want?

21:58.733 --> 22:00.733
-Jerry Lee?
-Two.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.133
You wanna hold
the line at two?

22:03.200 --> 22:04.733
Uh, four.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.767
Maybe four. I... I don't know.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.467
Not in public!

22:10.533 --> 22:11.867
Sorry, Peggy.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.533
Hi.

22:16.233 --> 22:17.433
Oh,

22:17.500 --> 22:20.433
honey, no. It...
It don't mean nothin'.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.733
Okay? Don't cry. All right?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.933
-It don't mean nothing.

22:25.067 --> 22:26.600
Peggy,

22:26.667 --> 22:28.500
you're my special girl.

22:29.467 --> 22:31.967
-Okay?
-Okay. Okay.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.200
I'm tellin' you,
"Joltin' Joe's"

22:38.267 --> 22:39.600
about to be jilted

22:39.667 --> 22:41.900
when missus turns
Miss Marilyn Monroe again,

22:41.967 --> 22:44.667
and Ol' Dewey Phillips
is gonna be right there!

22:44.733 --> 22:47.500
The whole movie was
How to Marry a Millionaire,

22:47.567 --> 22:51.467
not How to Marry a Just-Getting-By
Regional Disk Jockey.

22:51.533 --> 22:54.067
Oh, it's my scarlet woman.

22:54.067 --> 22:56.667
Oh, remember to mind
your manners, Mr. Hutchins.

22:56.733 --> 22:59.067
Well, lookie here!

22:59.100 --> 23:02.933
Looks like we got us
a steamy office romance
goin' on?

23:03.067 --> 23:04.967
Don't you have ad-copy
to review?

23:05.067 --> 23:07.067
No, but I gotta
call Hedda Hopper

23:07.133 --> 23:08.700
about you two,
give her the scoop...

23:08.767 --> 23:10.833
-All right, get out.
-Oh!

23:15.200 --> 23:16.667
I'd love to, uh,

23:16.733 --> 23:19.300
invite you to
the Bon Ton Cafe next week.

23:19.367 --> 23:22.200
I was thinkin' maybe we could
invite Sam and his wife.

23:22.267 --> 23:25.100
That would be great, Earle,
just not next week.

23:25.167 --> 23:28.667
Actually, I was hoping
to get time off.

23:28.733 --> 23:31.200
Station policy is
that you show up every day

23:31.267 --> 23:32.667
that you're on air, Marion.

23:32.733 --> 23:35.100
You see, WHBQ listeners
look forward to hearing

23:35.167 --> 23:39.300
Miss Scarlett Peabody
every morning at 10:10

23:39.367 --> 23:40.900
and so do I.

23:41.867 --> 23:44.133
I could pre-record some shows.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.633
That's clairvoyance,
not topical radio.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.933
Look is this
a personal matter?

23:53.067 --> 23:56.067
Sam and I are taking Elvis
on a promotional radio tour.

23:56.133 --> 23:58.767
Well, what's he need
a secretary for?

24:00.067 --> 24:02.967
Doesn't. He needs
his associate.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.100
Look, fine...

24:08.333 --> 24:10.733
I'm sorry, Marion,
but policy's policy.

24:14.067 --> 24:17.233
Here's the thing, Earle.
I'm going to do the tour

24:17.300 --> 24:18.600
and I really hope

24:18.667 --> 24:20.967
my job will still be here
when I get back.

24:21.067 --> 24:22.467
But if it's not,

24:22.533 --> 24:24.633
thanks for the opportunity.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.067
I mean that.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.733
All right. All right!

24:30.567 --> 24:32.100
But just one week.

24:34.233 --> 24:35.700
Thanks, Earle.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.267
I'm really lookin' forward
to our dinner when I get back.

24:41.367 --> 24:44.767
And what do you say
we let Sam and Becky
sit this one out?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.700
-Good luck, buddy.
-Atta boy.

25:08.767 --> 25:11.733
Hey, pal.
Raise you two bits.

25:14.467 --> 25:16.933
You are one plain dolt
luggin' that stupid clock

25:17.067 --> 25:18.133
-all the way to Korea...

25:18.200 --> 25:20.200
...just to bring it
back Stateside.

25:20.267 --> 25:21.700
Yeah, it ain't no stupider
than re-enlistin'
in the first place!

25:21.767 --> 25:24.667
-Right.
-Ay, pazzo, huh?

25:24.733 --> 25:26.100
So every time
that bird cuckoos,

25:26.167 --> 25:27.700
I'll think of you palookas
pulling your puds!

25:27.767 --> 25:30.133
How could we miss you
if you won't go away?

25:33.500 --> 25:36.133
I'm gonna miss
your hillbilly music, not you.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.333
-What's this crap?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.800
And you are?

25:45.867 --> 25:48.067
Nordquist. Airman First Class.

25:48.133 --> 25:51.067
This here's Gundersen, Bergen
and Larsson.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.700
Jeez. I mean,

25:54.767 --> 25:56.600
is there anybody left
in Minnesota?

25:56.667 --> 25:58.667
Hey,

25:58.733 --> 26:00.067
did you hear about
the accordion player

26:00.067 --> 26:02.600
-and the trumpet player?
-No.

26:02.667 --> 26:05.267
Both of 'em
sentenced to death.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.867
Warden says
to the accordion player,

26:07.933 --> 26:11.067
-"You get one last wish."
-What he say?

26:11.067 --> 26:13.267
"Let me play
the Beer Barrel Polka

26:13.333 --> 26:15.433
-"one last time."
-Damn right!

26:15.500 --> 26:18.800
Warden asks the trumpet player
for his last request.

26:19.667 --> 26:21.900
And what he say?

26:21.967 --> 26:23.267
BEAU,
"Hang me first!"

26:30.500 --> 26:31.767
See you, suckers!

26:31.833 --> 26:33.900
Next time I see you,
greaseball, you're dead!

26:39.333 --> 26:40.900
Ciao, boys.

26:52.267 --> 26:55.167
Oh, dear Lord,
that's a lot of money.

26:55.233 --> 26:56.567
We must be rollin' in it!

26:56.633 --> 26:58.867
We're goin' full throttle
on a dry tank, honey.

26:58.933 --> 27:00.900
Need to spend to make.

27:01.467 --> 27:02.500
Becky,

27:02.567 --> 27:04.767
we get Elvis on more stations,

27:04.833 --> 27:06.767
then the kids
go lookin' for the records,

27:06.833 --> 27:08.567
then the stores
call the distributors,

27:08.633 --> 27:09.700
then they call us

27:09.767 --> 27:12.233
and then we're rollin' in it.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.133
At least that's the plan,

27:14.200 --> 27:15.367
praise Jesus.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.367
Now... Now you're
asking him for help.

27:17.433 --> 27:18.667
Darlin', I'm asking everybody.

27:18.733 --> 27:20.633
-And who he doesn't, I do.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.633
-Whoo-hoo!

27:22.700 --> 27:24.767
Becky, dear,
I've got us lined up

27:24.833 --> 27:27.700
so you'll hardly
even notice Sam's gone.

27:27.767 --> 27:29.900
We've got bridge club
tonight at Jeanie's,

27:29.967 --> 27:31.667
Ladies Auxiliary
luncheon tomorrow,

27:31.733 --> 27:33.433
choir practice after that

27:33.500 --> 27:35.600
and the zoo's got a new tiger.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.500
-Mmm, I wish I was stayin'!

27:38.567 --> 27:40.900
I'm gonna miss all the fun.

27:41.667 --> 27:43.067
Mmm!

27:43.067 --> 27:45.200
And, Nadine,
I'm gonna miss you.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.333
Toodaloo.

27:50.100 --> 27:53.733
-Mmm.
-Please take me with you.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.067
We'll be back
before you know it.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.767
Fruit.

27:59.833 --> 28:02.067
All right,
let's start loadin' up.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.767
Bye, Marion.
-Bye.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.667
Every record
I played this afternoon

28:11.733 --> 28:13.933
has 40-45 pieces.

28:14.067 --> 28:17.833
This sounds like
three goons in a grain silo.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.233
Not for us, Sam.

28:28.433 --> 28:30.567
-This one's for the ladies.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.700
Man, like I was
saying, Herman,

28:35.767 --> 28:37.233
you did a helluva job

28:37.300 --> 28:39.300
helping me out
with The Prisonaires.

28:39.367 --> 28:42.067
I probably ain't even told you
how much I appreciate that.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.067
You ain't showing me, neither.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.067
Oh, ain't gonna do you
no good, Sam.

28:49.867 --> 28:51.067
It's so country,

28:51.133 --> 28:52.833
they shouldn't play it
after milkin'.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.367
They'd run me outta town.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.700
No one said
this was gonna be easy.

29:06.567 --> 29:08.067
Two rooms, please.

29:09.367 --> 29:10.767
Two rooms it is.

29:11.567 --> 29:13.167
I said three rooms.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.367
Three rooms it is.

29:16.433 --> 29:17.900
Uh, Mr. Phillips,

29:25.800 --> 29:27.500

on anyone.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.533

29:39.633 --> 29:41.267
Make that two rooms,
my friend.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.400
I got you.
That'll be $12, please.

eluded me.
