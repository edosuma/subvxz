WEBVTT

00:18.852 --> 00:21.021
We're finally headed
to the Good Place.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.064
It's the "me" of places.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.109
I got in. I can say stuff like that again.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.319
Are you sure
we're going the right way, Janet?

00:28.403 --> 00:30.697
Well, I've never been
to the Good Place before.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.991
But, yes, I am sure.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.701
How?

00:34.784 --> 00:35.744
Because...

00:36.619 --> 00:38.747
it feels like I'm on my way home.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.292
Flying puppy!

00:42.375 --> 00:44.878
You're almost there.
Just a little further.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.171
Flying puppies?

00:46.254 --> 00:47.505
Dang it, Michael.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.466
Why didn't you think of that
for your neighborhood?

00:49.549 --> 00:51.509
These guys are good.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.027
I feel just like
Dorothy when she lands in Oz,

01:09.110 --> 01:11.863
excited, incredulous,

01:11.946 --> 01:14.324
much taller than everyone else around me.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.618
What's everyone wanna do first?

01:16.701 --> 01:18.161
Racing go-karts with monkeys.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.245
Sure.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.331
It's my lifelong dream.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.541
Monkeys are the ideal go-kart opponents.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.878
They're funny enough to give the finger,
but not smart enough to win.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.174
- Does that mean me?
-You're a Good Janet.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.843
We're in the Good Place.
I don't know who else it would mean.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.678
Okay. No pressure.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.639
I was born to do this. Not born.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.393
Okay.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.479
So, I now know all the information
about the Good Place.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.523
In a nutshell, it slaps.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.690
First thing to tell you,

01:47.774 --> 01:51.986
humans can't see the Good Place all at
once or their brains will be scrambled.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.782
Cool. Maybe I'll finally get
some of those squigglies on my brain.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.118
Doctors said my brain's
as smooth as an egg.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.495
You all need to wait out here for a bit,
so you can adjust.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.164
When you're ready,
you will be honored with a welcome gala,

02:03.248 --> 02:06.668
magically planned by the Good Place,
based on your personalities.

02:06.751 --> 02:10.004
Like the targeted Instagram ad of parties.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.966
You know, I bought the coolest sunglasses
from one of those ads.

02:13.049 --> 02:13.883
Look.

02:14.717 --> 02:15.885
- Whoa!

02:16.344 --> 02:18.179
-It's like I'm inside the Internet.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.681
Okay.

02:19.764 --> 02:20.640
Could we just keep moving?

02:20.723 --> 02:21.891
You look a little pale.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.351
Did you get sick from the hot air balloon?

02:23.434 --> 02:25.270
I bet if you throw up
it'll just be butterflies or something.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.229
I'm fine.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.355
I just, um...

02:28.565 --> 02:29.774
I don't belong here.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.444
There's no telling what will happen
to a demon who steps foot in this place.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.573
Promise me, if I'm vaporized,
you guys just keep having fun.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.660
Oh, my goodness,
that chime is so soothing.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.871
Feels like my brain is being massaged...

02:42.954 --> 02:44.455
- ...by a baby deer.
- Oh, boy.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.584
What if that's some sort of demon alarm,
to alert the cops that I'm here?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.170
-You want me to hold your weed?
-I don't have weed.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.338
Oh...

02:53.006 --> 02:53.840
Wait a minute.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.758
Oh, yeah, okay, now, I do.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.926
Take this.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.303
They're ready
for you to move inside.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.013
The Good Place Committee
is waiting for us.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.476
Oh, man, look at this place.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.063
Karlie Kloss did like me.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.189
I knew it.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.649
-So, about this party...
- Yeah.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
Is everyone in the Good Place invited?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.028
Like, is Aristotle going to be there?

03:15.111 --> 03:18.615
Sorry, Chidi, Aristotle's in
the Bad Place. He defended slavery.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.074
-Socrates?
- No.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.743
Too annoying. Very loud chewer.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.661
-Plato?
-Slavery again.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.954
Ooh, you know who is here?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.665
Hypatia of Alexandria. Do you know her?

03:27.749 --> 03:28.875
Hypatia?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.085
-Of Alexandria?
-That's right.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.338
Uh, yeah, I know her.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.842
Hypatia. I'm gonna ask her
so many questions

03:37.926 --> 03:39.719
pertaining to grand ideas
about the universe.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.678
Like... "Why?"

03:40.762 --> 03:44.015
Oh, oh, and also... "How?"

03:44.098 --> 03:45.058
Ooh!

03:45.141 --> 03:46.809
Welcome to the Good Place, everyone.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.603
Michael, so happy you made it.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.979
You look radiant.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.650
You have the calming yet authoritative
presence of a bomb-sniffing dog.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.026
I'd just like to say

03:55.109 --> 03:58.154
thank you so much
for letting me be here with my friends.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.115
I know it's unorthodox
for someone like myself

04:01.199 --> 04:03.743
to visit the Good Place,
but it's just so wonderful.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.829
And I don't have any weed on me,
so no need for the cops.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.499
Michael, Michael,
you and your friends are heroes,

04:09.582 --> 04:11.417
and you're more than welcome here.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.586
In fact, we have some very exciting news.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.380
While the rest of you get settled in,

04:15.463 --> 04:17.799
we wanna give Michael
a swearing-in ceremony,

04:17.882 --> 04:20.218
so he can become
an official Good Place architect.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.055
Oh, my goodness.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.640
Michael, please, follow us.

04:27.642 --> 04:31.020
Holy fork, that is a soothing chime.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.691
It really is the most incredible chime
I've ever heard.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.442
And that is coming
from someone whose godfather

04:36.526 --> 04:38.403
is the most famous clock in the world.

04:38.486 --> 04:43.032
-Is Big Ben somehow your godfather?
-Mmm-hmm.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.367
That sound means...

04:44.951 --> 04:46.286
it's party time.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.499
When you walk through,
the event space will transform

04:51.582 --> 04:55.044
into a party perfectly tailored
to your essences.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.256
Let's link arms and walk through together.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.390
Weird.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.391
Whoa!

05:08.474 --> 05:12.270
This is the Jacksonville SuperSuites
hotel ballroom where I had my prom

05:12.353 --> 05:13.521
and also traffic court.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.190
But this has to be my party,

05:16.274 --> 05:20.194
because that's the bedpan
that Stone Cold Steve Austin

05:20.278 --> 05:24.407
used to beat up Vince McMahon
in 1998.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.076
It was a classic moment. Don't judge me.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.411
I'm so sorry, guys.

05:28.494 --> 05:32.165
The Good Place uses your life experiences
to plan the perfect party,

05:32.248 --> 05:34.375
but it's only designed
for one person at a time.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.252
When you walked in as a group,
it became...

05:36.336 --> 05:38.338
A mish-mash of all four of us.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.803
It's perfect.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.723
Um, no, it's not, Eleanor,

05:48.806 --> 05:51.350
because there's no go-kart track,
and no monkeys.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.186
No offense, but you're being
a real smooth-brain right now.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.353
See those green doors?

05:54.437 --> 05:58.775
You can use them to visit
any time or place, real or imagined.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.318
Just think about where you wanna go,

06:00.401 --> 06:03.112
and what you wanna do,
and walk on through.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.614
So, one could walk amongst the dinosaurs,

06:04.697 --> 06:08.451
or witness the very first production of
<i>Hamlet</i> at the Globe Theater.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.829
I'mma go Tokyo Drift with monkeys.
See you in a thousand years.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.999
Do you mind if I go find Hypatia?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.918
I promise it's strictly platonic.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.088
-Technically, Neoplatonic.
-Whoops.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.674
Forget I made that joke and come with me.
I'm so nervous to meet her.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.427
I need someone cool there to change
the subject if I say something dumb.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.720
Sure. Gimme one sec.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.098
Hey, Tahani, this room is filled

06:30.181 --> 06:33.059
with some of the most interesting people
that ever lived.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.228
Chat them up, learn about their lives,

06:35.311 --> 06:38.731
then meet back here
so that we can make fun of them.

06:39.398 --> 06:44.070
Eleanor Shellstrop, I have been training
for this day my entire life.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.032
I'm so honored by this gesture.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.077
This feels right.
This will be my new purpose.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.912
Everything's falling into place.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.082
Great. Let's get to it.
Just put on this ceremonial robe.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.961
Boy, do you have
the shoulders for a robe.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.963
-Oh.
-Just sign this scroll.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.966
I've never signed my name before.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.136
What signature type to choose?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.929
"Doctor Blob." Or, no...

07:10.012 --> 07:12.348
"Athlete who doesn't really care
about the kid."

07:12.974 --> 07:13.850
Oh, wait, no...

07:13.933 --> 07:16.727
"Middle school girl
with crush on Zac Efron."

07:16.811 --> 07:21.941
That way,
I can put a little heart over the "I."

07:22.024 --> 07:25.319
Perfect. And here is your official medal.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.738
Now I know what
Mary Lou Retton feels like.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.656
And great.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.950
Now, you are officially
in charge of the Good Place.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.828
-I'm sorry, "in charge"?
-Yup. You're the boss now.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.540
That was all legally binding,
and we all quit, effective immediately.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.251
That is irreversible,
so it's all your problem now.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.962
Don't try to find us.
No take-backs, okay, bye-bye!

07:43.045 --> 07:44.881
Hurry, move, move! Go, go, go!

07:49.927 --> 07:52.889
Hello? Fellow Good Placemen?

07:54.765 --> 07:55.725
Anyone in here?

07:57.101 --> 07:59.562
"Ideas for improving the Good Place." Oh.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.314
"Music you can eat."

08:01.397 --> 08:02.356
Oh, boy.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.611
"Giant mini-donuts,
not just regular donuts.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.112
Dave will explain."

08:09.030 --> 08:12.283
Dave? Can you explain?

08:12.992 --> 08:18.122
Um, hi, are you...
are you Hypatia of Alexandria?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.041
Yep. How's it hangin'?

08:20.124 --> 08:21.792
It's hangin' really well.

08:22.376 --> 08:27.632
Um, I gotta say, I was expecting you
to be, still, you know... ancient Greek.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.593
Oh! Well, no, we sort of stay current
in this place.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.845
What are the big things
from Earth recently?

08:32.929 --> 08:37.517
Um, the Industrial Revolution,
Manhattan Project, "Gangnam Style..."

08:37.600 --> 08:38.518
I feel like I get it.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.810
-It's really her!
-Yeah.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.688
I can just tell, somehow.
It's Hypatia of Alexandria.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.815
I know, babe. Yes, it is.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.402
Hi, sorry, I'm Eleanor.
This exuberant weirdo is Chidi.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.612
We're new in town.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.948
First question,
how do you get the "of" in your name?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.742
Is it where you hung out the most?

08:54.825 --> 08:58.746
Am I Eleanor of
the Cheesecake Factory Bar?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.999
Also, is it "Hy-pay-sha" or "Hy-pat-ia"?

09:02.083 --> 09:06.420
Or in the ancient Greek, "Who-put-tia"?
There's a lot of fun debate about this.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.964
You know what? Just call me Patty.

09:09.173 --> 09:13.719
Okay. Well, Patty, I'm a huge fan.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.597
I had a poster of you
on my wall in high school.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.600
Actually, it was just
a poster of Trinity from <i>The Matrix.</i>

09:19.684 --> 09:21.769
But that's how I imagined you would look.
Because you're so cool.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.146
Is she the reason you got beat up so much?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.273
She's one of them!

09:25.356 --> 09:26.732
Wanna get a milkshake?

09:26.816 --> 09:29.527
I haven't been around newbies in a while.
You're a little intense.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.404
Let's get a milkshake. Yeah.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.532
They make a milkshake here
that's made out of actual stardust.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.533
It's pretty good.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.995
Okay. Yeah. Getting milkshakes with Patty.

09:39.078 --> 09:39.996
Yeah.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.414
But can I ask you some questions first?

09:41.497 --> 09:44.083
You were a follower of Plotinus,

09:44.166 --> 09:46.460
who claimed that
contemplation of our ultimate reality--

09:46.544 --> 09:49.005
Wait, wait, wait, are you...

09:50.006 --> 09:53.926
What's it called, a think-book-man? Um...

09:54.552 --> 09:56.178
A think-read-book-man?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.263
A philosopher? Yes.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.766
Sorry, it's been so long,
my brain is foggy.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.729
Listen carefully
before I forget how to say this.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.107
You gotta help us. We are so screwed.

10:09.525 --> 10:10.610
We are?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.780
Hello! I'm Tahani Al-Jamil.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.575
I'm Paltibaal. Welcome to paradise.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.410
So, what's your story?

10:19.493 --> 10:22.538
Did you cure something?
Or invent something?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.957
I helped the poor in ancient Phoenicia.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.626
Excellent.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.086
I once had a SoulCycle instructor
named Phoenicia.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.382
How did you die?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.551
I got a cut on my hand.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.764
The year was 2491 BC,
so that's pretty much all it took.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.806
You got a cut

10:40.890 --> 10:44.352
or you drank water that wasn't hot enough,
and then, boom, dead.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.021
I would've killed for a vaccine.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.064
Any vaccine.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.609
It's crazy that you guys
just don't like them now.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.904
So, what's your favorite part
about living here?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.697
I mean, it's perfect.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.575
We're all having orgasms
literally all the time.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.951
I died a virgin,

11:01.702 --> 11:03.120
so that's real crazy.

11:04.705 --> 11:05.706
Okay.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.376
It's so nice to get to work alongside
another Good Janet!

11:08.459 --> 11:10.044
Yes, it is.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.712
Janet, can I get a Coke?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.465
No, a water.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.842
No, a lamp.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.928
No, a cat.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.973
So, people just ask you for things
with no rhyme or reason?

11:23.057 --> 11:26.185
Yes! And then I get them for them.
It's great.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.437
Can I get a spaceship?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.565
No, one huge Junior Mint.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.818
No, a Coke.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.699
Wow! This milkshake is incredible.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.285
Right? This is how I spend
most of my time.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.330
Sitting in beautiful places,
drinking my milkshake,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.082
slowly peeing into my pants,

11:48.165 --> 11:51.377
which instantly evaporates
and leaves no trace.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.586
-Sounds fun.
- Mmm.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.422
But didn't you want to tell us
how we're all screwed?

11:55.297 --> 11:57.425
Ah! Damn it.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.010
This is the exact problem.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.596
On paper, this is paradise.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.890
All of your desires and needs are met.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.142
But it's infinite.

12:06.225 --> 12:12.523
And when perfection goes on forever,
you become this glassy-eyed, mush person.

12:12.606 --> 12:17.319
But... no, because... no.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.904
Because... Patty, no!

12:18.988 --> 12:22.533
Yes, I'm telling you.
I used to be cool, man.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.369
I studied so much... things!

12:25.453 --> 12:29.582
Art and music, and, uh...

12:29.665 --> 12:32.168
the one with the number... piles?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.296
Where I'd be like, "Two!"
And you'd be like, "Six!"

12:35.379 --> 12:36.755
-Math?
-Yes.

12:36.839 --> 12:41.427
And then I came here,
where time stretched out forever,

12:41.510 --> 12:44.513
and every second of my existence
was amazing,

12:44.597 --> 12:47.433
but my brain became this big dumb blob.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.602
So, we finally make it into
the Good Place,

12:49.685 --> 12:51.604
and now we're just
going to become zombies?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.939
Why haven't you told anyone about this?

12:54.732 --> 12:55.941
-About what?
-Dude.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.610
Damn it!

12:59.195 --> 13:01.071
We have to find the others, right now.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.658
-Look, there's math on my shirt.
-Come on.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.452
Is it an "S" or a math?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.245
Have you seen Eleanor and Chidi?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.997
There's something
very wrong with this party.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.709
And it's not just that the caviar
is being served on top of Jell-O shots.

13:13.792 --> 13:18.964
We are the first new people here
in 500 years, and no one seems to care.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.717
I know, even the Good Janets
are kinda weird.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.302
They're like, "Hi, there!"

13:24.220 --> 13:26.639
When I do it, it's cool,
but when they do it, it's lame.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.309
Hey, guys. Having fun? Great.
So, little update.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.561
Um, the Good Place is a disaster.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.148
Everyone here is a happiness zombie,
and no one is doing anything about it,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.150
because by the time
they realize it's happening,

13:38.234 --> 13:39.527
everyone is too far gone to care.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.986
Oh, dear!

13:41.070 --> 13:42.655
Oh, hello, I'm Tahani.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.282
Hi, I'm Milkshake.
Do you want a milkshake?

13:45.366 --> 13:48.786
Okay. We need to tell someone before we're
too zonked out to remember why we're here.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.162
We need to find the Committee.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.165
The Committee is me.
I am Committee. It me.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.333
What?

13:54.416 --> 13:57.211
They tricked me,
and put me in charge of the Good Place,

13:57.294 --> 13:58.837
and then literally ran away.

13:58.921 --> 14:03.384
And then what happened, the Sorting Hat
put you in Hufflepuff? Roasted.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.594
Come on, I know we have problems,
but you can't expect me to ignore this.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.263
-Hang on. We're in paradise.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.557
Surely some people here
are enjoying themselves.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.267
Hey, guys. I'm back.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.435
Go-karting with monkeys
got boring really fast.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.395
It did?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.938
- Damn it.
- Oh, no!

14:17.731 --> 14:21.652
Jason, your lifelong dream
got old that quickly?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.780
I mean, monkeys in go-karts
was fun for a while.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.031
Then I was like,

14:26.115 --> 14:28.826
"You know what would be cool?
Hippos in go-karts!"

14:28.909 --> 14:32.621
And I was like,
"Yo, what about Draculas with jet-packs?"

14:32.705 --> 14:34.164
I did 50 combos,

14:34.248 --> 14:37.501
and then I just kinda wanted to
hang out with you guys again.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.753
Okay, that's it, in a nutshell.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.132
'Cause you get here and you realize
that anything is possible

14:43.215 --> 14:45.801
and you do everything
and then you're done.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.887
But you still have infinity left.

14:47.970 --> 14:52.391
This place kills fun, and passion,
and excitement and love,

14:52.474 --> 14:54.852
till all you have left are milkshakes.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.479
The Good Place Committee
obviously knew about this.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.939
Why didn't they try and solve it?

14:59.023 --> 15:01.066
They did. They tried everything.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.028
Just last week they made
the unicorns bigger,

15:04.111 --> 15:07.865
and then they gave them more horns,
and then they made them chubbier.

15:07.948 --> 15:12.703
I mean, really, they just made
a bunch of weird, fluffy rhinos.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.623
The Committee members aren't human,
so they couldn't understand the problem.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.249
The second I showed up,

15:17.333 --> 15:20.461
they jumped off this sinking ship
and made me captain.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.921
Well, I'm not giving up.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.925
We worked too hard
and went through too much.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.718
I'm not gonna just sit back

15:27.801 --> 15:31.388
and turn into some slack-jawed,
sweatpant-wearing orgasm machine!

15:31.472 --> 15:32.348
Oh, my God!

15:32.431 --> 15:34.308
I'm describing
my dream existence like it's bad.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.185
What is wrong with this place?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.937
We just redesigned this system,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.564
and soon millions of people
are going to start pouring in,

15:40.648 --> 15:43.734
thinking they're in paradise,
only to become a joyless husk.

15:43.817 --> 15:47.279
It's Coachella!
We've invented Cosmic Coachella!

15:47.363 --> 15:48.739
Oh, we have to fix this.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.785
What if we do what I did to you
in the original neighborhood?

15:52.868 --> 15:55.079
Erase their memory every once in a while.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.123
That way,
paradise would seem fresh and new.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.417
You were doing that to torture us.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.170
Actual paradise
can't use the same playbook as hell.

16:03.253 --> 16:06.131
Okay, well, I have a solution.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.301
Remember what I said to you,
when you were going through your

16:09.385 --> 16:12.096
"midlife crisis, one earring,
red convertible" phase?

16:12.179 --> 16:14.098
-"You look so stupid"?
-After that.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.727
You said that, "Every human is
a little bit sad all the time

16:18.811 --> 16:20.521
because you know you're gonna die.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.733
But that knowledge
is what gives life meaning."

16:26.193 --> 16:31.198
The way to restore meaning to the people
in the Good Place is to let them leave.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.702
Leave and go where? This is the last...

16:35.494 --> 16:36.328
Oh.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.541
Can we just do that?

16:41.917 --> 16:43.877
You're the head of the Good Place now.

16:44.878 --> 16:48.966
Seems to me you can do whatever you want.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.469
Where is Michael?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.306
Okay.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.520
Nothing to do but announce the big change.

17:01.603 --> 17:06.442
Whatever happens, it's cool, my babies.
It's very cool.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.529
Did you smoke that weed, bud?

17:13.365 --> 17:14.366
I did.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.703
I was kinda freaked out,
so I smoked some grass, but now I'm great.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.873
Let's change the afterlife, and then...

17:20.956 --> 17:22.374
-Taco Bell.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.170
Oh, baby!

17:26.253 --> 17:27.796
Okay, I'm gonna do the talking.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.133
Hi, everyone.
Can I have your attention, please?

17:31.216 --> 17:33.635
Hi, my name's Eleanor Shellstrop.

17:33.719 --> 17:39.725
Hope you're having fun at our
Flor-izona British Library Extravaganza.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.730
I guess you don't really
have fun anywhere, which is the point.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.233
It doesn't seem like
this is paradise for you.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.695
You've basically been
on a never-ending vacation,

17:51.779 --> 17:55.365
and vacations are only special
because they end.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.576
So, we have an idea.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.871
We're going to set up a new kind of door,
um, somewhere peaceful.

18:00.954 --> 18:04.792
So that when you feel happy,
and satisfied and complete

18:04.875 --> 18:06.335
and you want to leave
the Good Place for good,

18:06.418 --> 18:11.381
you can just walk through it
and your time in the universe will end.

18:12.424 --> 18:17.012
You don't have to go through it,
if you don't want to, but you can.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.432
And hopefully,
knowing you don't have to be here forever

18:20.516 --> 18:22.101
will help you feel happier while you are.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.853
What will happen when we go through it?

18:26.522 --> 18:28.440
Well, we don't really know, exactly.

18:28.524 --> 18:33.487
All we know is it will be peaceful,
and your journey will be over.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.156
You led great lives.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.158
You earned your place here.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.203
So, stay here as long as you like.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.915
Use the green doors to see and do

18:44.998 --> 18:48.544
every single thing you want to see and do.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.338
And when you're ready,

18:51.922 --> 18:56.218
walk through one last door
and be at peace.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.930
Does that sound good?

19:06.645 --> 19:08.147
Seems like they're into it.

19:15.404 --> 19:19.533
It's DJ Music, make some noise!

19:19.616 --> 19:20.993
That's my boyfriend.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.329
I'm glad we'll be able to
enjoy things again.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.499
-Art, math, philosophy, like you used to.
-Yeah, me, too.

19:27.583 --> 19:33.255
I've been dreaming of ending the ennui
of this eternal existence for a long time.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.425
But now,
I think I'll stick around for a while.

19:36.508 --> 19:41.096
It felt good to make brain words.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.974
Still mushy. I'll get it back.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.893
We're lucky we ran into you.

19:45.976 --> 19:46.977
It saved us.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.189
That's not what saved you.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.650
-Hey!
- Hey!

19:54.818 --> 19:56.653
-It was your friendships.
-Yeah, no, I got it.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.698
Sorry. Still not sharp.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.621
Kept most of it the same.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.498
Even made myself an office nearby.

20:09.666 --> 20:14.087
Jason, I... I kinda took a wild guess...

20:15.172 --> 20:18.967
I finally get to accomplish
my goal of living in a Stupid Nick's!

20:19.051 --> 20:20.969
I know anything you do
for eternity gets boring,

20:21.053 --> 20:23.639
but I swear,
I will never get sick of wings.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.100
Well, I'll see you all tomorrow.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.686
And every tomorrow after that.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.773
You know, Michael, at the end of the day,
you were right.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.902
Everything is fine.

20:54.878 --> 21:00.217
This is what we've been
looking for since the day we met... time.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.553
I guess that's what
the Good Place really is.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.721
It's not even a "place," really.

21:04.805 --> 21:09.768
It's just having enough time
with the people you love.

21:09.851 --> 21:10.894
You're right.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.815
And we have as long as we want.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.777
If you keep hogging this blanket,

21:18.860 --> 21:21.488
I'm probably gonna walk through that door
in three days, though.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.577
- I'll miss you.
