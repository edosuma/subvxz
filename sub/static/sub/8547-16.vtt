Hey, Smitty, anyone heard
from Rivers yet?

00:18.440 --> 00:20.071
Smitty, on radio:
Negative.

00:20.073 --> 00:22.760
I don't mind the overtime,
but you'd think he'd at least call.

00:22.762 --> 00:24.289
We'll advise
if he checks in.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.922
Copy.

00:25.924 --> 00:27.414
I'm gonna take a leak.

00:39.868 --> 00:44.198
Hey, Smitty, I got something
down here by the utility closet.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.648
It looks like
it might be blood.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.945
Did you say blood?

00:49.947 --> 00:52.209
Yeah. I'm gonna check it out
and then, uh...

00:52.211 --> 00:53.898
You'll want to send
somebody down, though.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.899
Copy.

01:14.643 --> 01:17.974
Oh, my God.
Rivers.

01:17.976 --> 01:20.875
We found him last night.

01:20.877 --> 01:22.735
It's the second guard
in 3 months.

01:22.737 --> 01:26.138
Rossi: Both stabbed in the neck
with a sock stuffed in their mouth.

01:26.140 --> 01:27.998
Yeah, that's what made me
think to call you.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.601
The sock could be some kind
of signature, couldn't it?

01:30.603 --> 01:32.261
It's possible.

01:32.263 --> 01:35.099
Forgive me, Warden Tate, but this
is a prison we're talking about.

01:35.101 --> 01:37.033
Isn't every inch of the place
covered with surveillance?

01:37.035 --> 01:41.023
It's an older facility, and we're
still making updates to the system,

01:41.025 --> 01:43.158
but officer Hightower was
killed in a riot incident

01:43.160 --> 01:45.563
where the inmates
temporarily disabled the cameras.

01:45.565 --> 01:48.891
Well, this could be a retaliatory act
against the administration.

01:48.893 --> 01:50.418
In which case
it could happen again.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.717
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

01:52.719 --> 01:55.522
Look, I only took over 6 months ago,
and two men are dead.

01:55.524 --> 01:57.653
They had families.

01:57.655 --> 02:00.145
Warden, we're here to help
however we can.

02:00.147 --> 02:01.710
Let us discuss it
with our team

02:01.712 --> 02:03.516
and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

02:03.518 --> 02:05.846
Yeah, sounds good.
Thank you both.

02:06.879 --> 02:08.508
Federal penitentiary.

02:08.509 --> 02:10.145
Technically
it is on our watch.

02:10.148 --> 02:12.876
A privately owned penitentiary
outsourced by the DOJ.

02:12.878 --> 02:14.506
How'd you meet this guy?

02:14.508 --> 02:16.134
At a conference in D.C.
he was a lobbyist

02:16.136 --> 02:17.769
for the same company
that owns the prison.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.030
Why go from a lobbyist
on the Hill

02:20.032 --> 02:21.795
to a prison warden
in East Texas?

02:21.797 --> 02:24.498
Apparently he got a nice salary package
for taking the job.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.000
And now he's
in over his head.

02:26.002 --> 02:28.667
[Sighs] 2,000 inmates,
and probably half of them

02:28.669 --> 02:31.001
already in there
for violent crimes.

02:31.003 --> 02:34.166
Well, the good news
and the bad news is,

02:34.168 --> 02:37.466
we've already got
our suspect pool.

looking at multiple unsubs.

04:49.438 --> 04:51.732
Multiple unsubs in a prison,
sounds like a gang.

05:09.057 --> 05:10.688
The Reagan Federal

06:51.276 --> 06:52.907

06:52.909 --> 06:54.939
but I'll catch up
with you ASAP.

06:54.941 --> 06:57.013
I'm sorry there's no
cell signal inside the walls.

06:57.015 --> 06:58.516
We had to jam it.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.684
You got inmates
smuggling phones in?

07:00.686 --> 07:02.548
Yeah, it's been
a problem, one of many.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.021
What about Wi-Fi?

07:04.023 --> 07:05.725
We got you set up
as close to the router as possible,

07:05.727 --> 07:07.357
but it's still glitchy.
It drives me nuts.

07:07.359 --> 07:10.292
Back when I worked on the Hill,
I couldn't survive without my phone.

07:10.294 --> 07:12.995
I got a teenager at home who knows
exactly how you feel.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.730
Heh heh. Well, we have got
a good old-fashioned land line

07:15.732 --> 07:17.233
and a fax machine for you,
though.

07:17.235 --> 07:19.561
I thought I was the only one
that still used those.

07:19.563 --> 07:22.569
And there actually is
a pretty decent signal outside,

07:22.571 --> 07:24.072
so you're not completely
cut off.

07:24.074 --> 07:26.871
We'll provide all your meals.
Food's not much to speak of,

07:26.873 --> 07:28.902

over by your hotel
and bring it in.

JJ: Excuse me, Doctor, when's
the coroner coming to pick him up?

07:35.444 --> 07:37.241
I don't know.

07:37.243 --> 07:39.808
Any idea how long
the autopsy will take?

07:39.810 --> 07:41.247
No, none.

07:41.249 --> 07:43.279
Ok, then, is there
anything you can tell us?

07:43.281 --> 07:45.813
Sorry. I'm not
out here that much.

07:45.815 --> 07:48.517
Excuse me, please.

07:53.022 --> 07:54.684
Check this out.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.259
His fingers are broken.

07:58.261 --> 08:01.560
That other guard, Hightower,
his fingers were broken, too.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.789
And if I remember right,

08:03.791 --> 08:06.861
7, just like this guy.

08:06.863 --> 08:08.862
The M.E. said Hightower's
were defensive wounds.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.301
Probably happened in
the struggle during the riot.

08:11.303 --> 08:13.766
I don't see any obvious
defensive wounds on him.

08:13.768 --> 08:14.967
Yeah. We need an autopsy.

08:14.969 --> 08:16.303
Good luck with that.

08:16.305 --> 08:18.237
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
go light a fire

08:18.239 --> 08:20.078
under Dr. Helpful out here.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.109
I bet all the inmates know
exactly what areas

08:22.111 --> 08:23.573
are covered by surveillance.

08:23.575 --> 08:24.910
That they do.

08:24.912 --> 08:27.078
The lock's not picked,
so they either stole a key

08:27.080 --> 08:29.382
from a guard or took one
off the victim.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.382
But how did they get him
all the way back here?

08:31.384 --> 08:33.687
They either waited
or lured him here somehow.

08:33.688 --> 08:36.094
And look at this shelf.
It's pretty high. It had to take

08:36.096 --> 08:37.693
at least two attackers
to get him up here.

08:37.696 --> 08:39.828
What's the deal
with the shoddy surveillance?

08:39.830 --> 08:41.860
I mean, this is a big hallway.
No cameras?

08:41.861 --> 08:45.426
Ask our corporate office.
Maybe you'll have better luck than I did.

08:45.428 --> 08:47.634
What do you mean by that?

08:49.499 --> 08:51.432
It's ok. You can level
with us.

08:51.434 --> 08:54.230
I requested cameras,
dozens of times,

08:54.232 --> 08:57.700
but I got shot down because
upgrades cost money.

with you, ok.

about is the bottom line,

find your way back?

09:28.527 --> 09:30.894
You know, Callahan,
there's one other possibility

09:30.896 --> 09:33.198
we need to consider.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.472
What if a guard
is actually involved?

09:35.474 --> 09:38.274
It just means we've got
to be careful who we can trust.

Come on, you both know
if it was me,

11:15.505 --> 11:17.070
I'd be braggin'
about it already.

11:17.072 --> 11:20.006
What I got to hide?
What, they gonna give me more time?

11:20.008 --> 11:22.849
I got life plus 30 already.

11:22.851 --> 11:25.587
That mean after I die,
I gotta be back up in here anyway.

11:25.589 --> 11:27.485
All right, then,
do you know anything

11:27.487 --> 11:29.461
about who might be involved?

11:29.463 --> 11:32.097
Nah, man, me and my people,
we don't mess with socks.

11:32.099 --> 11:34.003
It's melodramatic.

11:35.206 --> 11:37.310
You know about that?

11:37.312 --> 11:39.141
I know about a lot.

11:39.143 --> 11:41.741
Just not who did it.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.318
Morgan: And you're not
exactly crying over it, though, are you?

11:47.383 --> 11:49.855
Turn up the pressure there, Hightower.
He can take more than that.

11:49.857 --> 11:50.856
Hightower: Come on,
Julio, stand up.

11:50.858 --> 11:52.129
Come on!
Come on!

11:52.131 --> 11:54.066
He can take it.
Turn it up.

11:54.068 --> 11:56.395
[Indistinct shouts]

11:56.397 --> 11:58.437
Aren't you
soaked, Julio?

11:58.439 --> 11:59.471
Come on, get up.

11:59.473 --> 12:01.640
Stand up, man.

12:01.642 --> 12:04.049
Them two cops,

12:04.051 --> 12:06.344
world's better off
without 'em.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.247
According to who?
You?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.918
Me and everybody else
in here wearing green.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.285
Ask around.

12:12.287 --> 12:14.253
Due respect, Julio,

12:14.255 --> 12:16.326
but you're a mass murderer
who copped a plea

12:16.328 --> 12:19.723
and flipped on your friends
in exchange for a lesser sentence.

12:19.725 --> 12:23.424
You're not exactly what
I would call a reliable character witness.

12:23.426 --> 12:25.159
Believe whatever
you want.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.428
But trust,
I hated them pigs.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.893
Matter of fact,
I wish I had done it.

12:30.895 --> 12:35.228
It would have given me
something to do to pass the time.

12:36.270 --> 12:38.436
There's a couple more guys
that we should talk to.

12:38.438 --> 12:39.605
So far no one
knows anything,

12:39.607 --> 12:41.101
but if they do,
they're just not talking.

12:41.103 --> 12:43.709
Maybe this has nothing to do
with gang-related activity.

12:43.711 --> 12:44.942
The one thing they
all have in common

12:44.944 --> 12:46.342
is no love for
Hightower or Rivers.

12:46.344 --> 12:47.614
Morgan:
This could be personal.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.414
Maybe someone had a beef
with those two.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.815
We need to complete our profiles.
The answer's in there.

12:51.817 --> 12:53.287
How much time do you need?
Uh...

12:53.289 --> 12:54.656
126 minutes,
approximately.

12:54.658 --> 12:55.656
Well, hurry.

12:55.658 --> 12:57.657
We should go help finish
those interviews.

12:57.659 --> 12:59.130
I'll join you
in a minute,

12:59.132 --> 13:02.134
but first I'm gonna go outside and
check in with Garcia.

13:05.376 --> 13:08.276
[Clock ticking]

13:25.091 --> 13:26.921
The preliminary M.E.
report on Rivers

13:26.923 --> 13:29.361
says his fingers
were broken postmortem.

13:29.363 --> 13:31.425
7 broken fingers
could mean anything.

13:31.427 --> 13:33.391
The number 7 is widely
regarded as being lucky,

13:33.393 --> 13:36.399
and it plays a ubiquitous role in
most of the world's major religions,

13:36.401 --> 13:38.430
not to mention astrology, astronomy,
literature, music.

13:38.432 --> 13:39.932
The interesting thing
about the number 7

13:39.934 --> 13:41.563
is that it's not only
a factorial prime--

13:41.565 --> 13:42.962
Reid, did you get
through the files?

13:42.964 --> 13:44.900
I did, and I found
a discrepancy.

13:44.902 --> 13:48.307
There seems to be
a prisoner unaccounted for.

13:48.309 --> 13:49.740
Devon White. At first
I almost missed it

13:49.742 --> 13:51.276
because there's not even
a file for him,

13:51.278 --> 13:52.780
but I triple-checked
the inmate manifest,

13:52.782 --> 13:54.248
cross-checked that with
the attendance logs,

13:54.250 --> 13:57.520
and it turns out that one day
3 months ago he just vanished.

13:57.522 --> 14:00.319
3 months ago was right
before Hightower was killed.

14:01.722 --> 14:04.295
We need to find him.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.536
Hey!

14:15.370 --> 14:18.205
[Muffled screams]

14:18.207 --> 14:19.802
Aah!
[Bones crack]

14:21.436 --> 14:23.603
[Screaming continues]

14:41.478 --> 14:43.276
Devon White.

14:43.278 --> 14:44.939
I...

14:44.941 --> 14:47.641
Yeah, I--I didn't
know him personally.

14:47.643 --> 14:48.839
I remember him.

14:48.841 --> 14:51.044
D-block. He was
transferred to Nixon,

14:51.046 --> 14:52.380
and that's one
of their facilities

14:52.382 --> 14:53.843
just outside of Pensacola.
May I?

14:53.845 --> 14:55.643
Hotch: Any idea why this wasn't
with the other records?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.944
Who knows? I can't get them
to do it right over at corporate.

14:57.946 --> 14:59.543
We'd like to arrange
to speak to him.

14:59.545 --> 15:00.945
He was here before
the first murder,

15:00.945 --> 15:02.510
and that's always
the most significant.

15:02.512 --> 15:03.678
I'll make some calls.
Thank you.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.180
Radio: Wilson on C
for Shavers.

15:05.182 --> 15:06.515
Captain, do you copy?

15:06.517 --> 15:07.650
Go for Shavers.

15:07.652 --> 15:09.849
Uh, sir, we've got
a situation down here.

15:09.851 --> 15:11.216
What happened?

15:11.218 --> 15:14.690
There's, uh, there's
been another murder.

15:17.567 --> 15:20.059
7 broken fingers
and a sock in the mouth.

15:20.061 --> 15:21.563
This time there's evidence
of sexual assault.

15:21.565 --> 15:23.099
We didn't see that
with the other victims.

15:23.101 --> 15:24.236
Who was he?

15:24.238 --> 15:26.373
Randall Jefferson Jones,
inmate number 91751.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.209
He was a serial rapist in the 10th year
of a 20-year-sentence.

15:29.211 --> 15:30.451
How did this
happen again?

15:30.453 --> 15:32.222
These men are supposed
to be locked down?

15:32.224 --> 15:33.792
He was privileged
status, sir.

15:33.794 --> 15:36.457
How did a serial rapist
end up privileged?

15:36.459 --> 15:38.026
Jones gave us information
from time to time.

15:38.028 --> 15:40.034
That explains the shift
in victimology

15:40.036 --> 15:41.266
and the high level
of violence.

15:41.268 --> 15:43.098
Well, at least we know
the killers must be someone

15:43.100 --> 15:45.107
with privileged status
on this cell block, right?

15:45.109 --> 15:46.427
Yeah, that's over 100 guys,

15:46.451 --> 15:48.452
and this shot could have
been called from anywhere.

15:48.743 --> 15:50.213
Hotch: Is there surveillance
in this area?

15:50.215 --> 15:52.677
Not inside the bathroom itself
but the hallway outside.

15:52.679 --> 15:54.644
All right, we'll need
to review the footage immediately.

15:54.646 --> 15:55.611
You got it.

15:55.613 --> 15:57.419
Doing this over here
is incredibly bold.

15:57.421 --> 15:58.715
It's practically a taunt.

15:58.717 --> 15:59.914
Or a message.

15:59.916 --> 16:01.154
To who?

16:01.156 --> 16:03.418
Us.

16:22.972 --> 16:24.298
Chocolate thunder,
chocolate thunder,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.201
where have you been?
I've left like 4 messages?

16:26.203 --> 16:27.968
I'm sorry, mama.
You know there's no signal inside.

16:27.970 --> 16:30.473
That is cruel and unusual
punishment.

16:30.475 --> 16:32.241
You know that if I don't
phone flirt with you

16:32.243 --> 16:34.042
at least twice a day,
I get all itchy.

16:34.044 --> 16:35.546
Promise me
you'll check in more.

16:35.548 --> 16:37.577
Hey, what do you think I'm doing right now?
Come on, breathe.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.615
You got anything for me?

16:38.617 --> 16:40.077
Yes, of course I do.

16:40.079 --> 16:42.782
I have some decidedly
weird information

16:42.784 --> 16:45.256
about the first two victims,
Rivers and Hightower.

16:45.258 --> 16:48.288
They, for the past year,
have matching bank activity,

16:48.290 --> 16:49.792
and a lot of it.

16:49.794 --> 16:52.527
Like one guy would withdraw
cash and the other one

16:52.529 --> 16:54.894
would deposit
the exact same amount,

16:54.896 --> 16:56.864
sometimes as low as 200 bucks,

16:56.866 --> 16:58.433
a couple times as high
as 2,000.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.201
They even wrote checks
to each other.

17:00.203 --> 17:02.336
If I was a betting woman,
I would bet that these two

17:02.338 --> 17:03.703
have been paying off bets.

17:03.705 --> 17:05.701
That's nice work, baby girl.
Good job.

17:05.703 --> 17:07.404
Thank you.
Hey, take care of yourself.

17:07.406 --> 17:08.508
Come on, you know me.

17:08.510 --> 17:10.411
Yeah, I do.
That's why I'm saying it.

17:10.413 --> 17:12.507
Can't see anything
on the surveillance footage.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.843
They cut the lights
in the hallway

17:13.845 --> 17:15.211
and the cameras
don't have I.R.

17:15.213 --> 17:16.882
How'd they get access
to the power?

17:16.884 --> 17:18.546
Same way they got
into that closet.

17:18.548 --> 17:20.448
One of the guards
is definitely in on this.

17:20.450 --> 17:22.679
Hotch: Maybe not willingly.
There have been cases where inmates

17:22.681 --> 17:24.182
have manipulated
prison staff with threats.

17:24.184 --> 17:26.549
Guys, I've been looking
for connections between our victims,

17:26.550 --> 17:28.050
and I think I may
have found something.

17:28.053 --> 17:30.153
Before our dead convict,
Randall Jefferson Jones,

17:30.155 --> 17:31.078
achieved privileged status,

17:31.102 --> 17:33.440
he just happened to be
cellmates with Devon White.

17:33.658 --> 17:35.856
Ok, so why does Devon's
name keep popping up?

17:35.858 --> 17:37.993
I thought the same thing,
so I kept searching,

17:37.995 --> 17:39.827
which oddly enough led me back
to Hightower and Rivers.

17:39.829 --> 17:41.395
They filed more
disciplinary write-ups

17:41.397 --> 17:42.900
than any other guards
in the entire prison,

17:42.902 --> 17:44.164
and guess who got
a lot of them.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.237
Devon White.

17:45.239 --> 17:46.742
Yeah, but for relatively
minor infractions--

17:46.744 --> 17:48.741
improperly made bed,
non-regulation clothing.

17:48.743 --> 17:50.605
They once put him
in solitary confinement

17:50.607 --> 17:52.110
for hiding candy bars
under his bed.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.510
I wonder why
they rode him so hard.

17:53.512 --> 17:54.710
Here's the strange
thing, though.

17:54.712 --> 17:57.482
He has no history of physical
violence in his past,

17:57.484 --> 18:01.143
yet he made frequent visits to the infirmary
for injuries related to fighting.

18:01.145 --> 18:03.213
Do we have medical
files here?

18:03.215 --> 18:05.011
No, we need to check
the infirmary.

18:05.013 --> 18:06.714
There it is.

18:06.716 --> 18:09.981
Ok. Devon White.

18:09.983 --> 18:12.611
Looks like he was
in here quite a bit.

18:16.684 --> 18:18.552
Broken nose, stitches,

18:18.554 --> 18:20.614
missing tooth.

18:20.616 --> 18:23.350
He may not have been
a violent guy when he got here,

18:23.352 --> 18:25.485
but this place certainly
turned him into one.

18:25.487 --> 18:28.724
This man was sexually
assaulted several times,

18:28.726 --> 18:31.187
but why am I not seeing
anything in here about a rape kit?

18:31.189 --> 18:32.690
No evidence collection,
nothing.

18:32.692 --> 18:34.192
Probably didn't want
to file a report.

18:34.194 --> 18:35.656
See it all the time.

18:35.658 --> 18:37.023
Do you think
this has anything to do

18:37.025 --> 18:38.559
with the sexual assault
of the third victim?

18:38.561 --> 18:40.030
You mean like
an eye for an eye?

18:40.032 --> 18:41.366
It's a good bet.

18:41.368 --> 18:43.030
We need to find
Devon White.

18:43.032 --> 18:45.565
Meantime, we need to talk
to someone who knew him.

18:45.567 --> 18:48.669
Somebody in this place
knows something.

18:48.671 --> 18:51.605
Hell, yeah,
I remember Devon,

18:51.607 --> 18:53.076
from up in the library.

18:53.078 --> 18:54.876
You two were
pretty good buddies?

18:54.878 --> 18:57.308
He's the one helped me
get my G.E.D.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.148
He's a good dude.

18:59.150 --> 19:01.812
They transferred him
up out of here.

19:01.814 --> 19:03.548
He all right?

19:05.885 --> 19:09.019
Mr. Sam Pritchett.

19:09.021 --> 19:12.354
I'm Agent David Rossi.

19:12.356 --> 19:14.289
How you doin'?

19:14.291 --> 19:17.058
Can't complain.

19:17.060 --> 19:19.699
Well, you could, but
who'd be listening, right?

19:21.237 --> 19:23.202
Can I get you something?
Water? Coffee?

19:25.205 --> 19:27.602
Ok.

19:27.604 --> 19:28.767
I, uh,

19:28.769 --> 19:32.434
I wanted to ask you
about Devon White.

19:32.436 --> 19:34.999
It says here you worked
in the library with him.

19:35.001 --> 19:36.902
Till they assigned me
to another work detail.

19:36.904 --> 19:40.712
I see you worked there
almost 20 years.

19:40.714 --> 19:41.714
Why the change?

19:41.715 --> 19:42.978
Not my choice.

19:42.980 --> 19:46.048
So did that have anything
to do with officer Hightower?

19:46.050 --> 19:50.412
You know, I ask that because
I see his name on the work transfer.

19:50.414 --> 19:53.018
Guard: Hi there, Sam.
You miss us?

19:53.020 --> 19:54.755
Up.

20:03.362 --> 20:05.022
Got a lot of books.

20:09.927 --> 20:11.629
Get over here.
Got a lot of books, Sam.

20:11.631 --> 20:14.365
don't you know you're
not supposed to have books?

20:14.367 --> 20:16.796
It's against the rules.

20:20.907 --> 20:23.031
I go where they tell me to go.

20:25.904 --> 20:27.373
Right.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.540
So what can you tell me
about Devon?

20:29.542 --> 20:33.243
Good kid, hard worker,

20:33.245 --> 20:35.243
loved to read.

20:35.245 --> 20:37.242
Not like most of these
other knuckleheads.

20:37.244 --> 20:39.177
So you two
were pretty close.

20:40.851 --> 20:44.183
Ah, you know,
liked to look out for him.

20:46.887 --> 20:48.348
And why is that?

20:48.350 --> 20:50.548
Some of these young cats
that come in here,

20:50.550 --> 20:52.484
they get overwhelmed.

20:53.589 --> 20:55.554
Don't got the makeup for it.

20:55.556 --> 20:56.719
Inmate: What you
doing, newbie?

20:56.721 --> 20:58.190
Where you from,
brother?

20:58.192 --> 21:00.654
[Laughter]

21:00.656 --> 21:02.852
[Indistinct chatter]

21:28.014 --> 21:30.053
What's up, young blood?

21:30.055 --> 21:32.485
Sam.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.492
Devon.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.690
Rossi:
So he was a good kid.

21:42.731 --> 21:44.528
Well, that, uh,

21:44.530 --> 21:48.167
that's funny, because
I got a stack of disciplinary write-ups

21:48.169 --> 21:49.367
that say different.

21:49.369 --> 21:53.236
In fact, officer Hightower
and another guy, Rivers,

21:53.238 --> 21:55.204
they wrote Devon up a lot,

21:55.206 --> 21:58.237
even took him to the
infirmary for fighting.

21:59.312 --> 22:00.976
I don't know nothin'
about that.

22:00.978 --> 22:04.049
Well, did they have some kind
of problem with Devon?

22:04.051 --> 22:05.249
You'd have to ask them.

22:05.251 --> 22:06.417
They're both dead.

22:06.419 --> 22:08.353
You don't say.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.627
Ok, then.

22:14.165 --> 22:16.130
What are you
not telling me?

22:16.132 --> 22:20.730
'Cause I'm sitting
here looking at you looking at me,

22:20.732 --> 22:26.566
and my gut says you know exactly
what's going on in here.

22:31.268 --> 22:34.105
I don't know nothin'.

23:24.259 --> 23:26.687
Shh.

23:45.475 --> 23:48.609
Before the CCC took over,
Devon White was a model inmate.

23:48.611 --> 23:51.081
He never got written up.
Not one infirmary visit.

23:51.083 --> 23:54.519
None of that started until officers
Hightower and Rivers were hired.

23:54.521 --> 23:55.950
And that's right around
the same time

23:55.952 --> 23:57.422
they started exchanging
all that money.

23:57.424 --> 23:59.917
That bank activity has to have something
to do with this.

23:59.919 --> 24:02.084
If they were paying off bets,
what could they be betting on?

24:02.086 --> 24:04.659
Some kind of regular
poker game, maybe.

24:04.661 --> 24:06.123
Sports, maybe a fight.

24:06.125 --> 24:08.458
What if its some sort
of sanctioned violence

24:08.460 --> 24:10.162
right here
at the prison?

24:10.164 --> 24:11.626
You mean like a fight club?

24:11.628 --> 24:13.067
I've heard of that
happening in prisons.

24:13.069 --> 24:15.669
Maybe it was their own sadistic version
of that using inmates.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.342
That could explain
why Devon was fighting.

24:17.344 --> 24:19.310
So the sock in the mouth
and the 7 broken fingers

24:19.312 --> 24:20.807
must be related
to a specific event.

24:20.809 --> 24:23.781
And if I'm guessing,
an event involving Devon White.

24:25.511 --> 24:28.982
Our presence here
is forcing the issue.

24:36.865 --> 24:38.559
Up.

25:04.885 --> 25:08.620
Captain,
I got something.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.967
Take him downstairs.

25:26.514 --> 25:28.914
Get in there.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.891
[Door closes]

25:34.893 --> 25:37.427
[Outer door closes]

25:38.723 --> 25:41.991
I should have
figured it out sooner.

25:41.993 --> 25:45.433
Now I'm gonna give you
a chance to come clean.

25:45.435 --> 25:47.433
Who was helping you?

25:47.435 --> 25:49.265
Huh?

25:49.267 --> 25:51.169
Who was helping you?

25:57.471 --> 25:59.405
Who was it?!

25:59.407 --> 26:00.942
Who?!

26:02.447 --> 26:04.581
You gonna make me
disappear, too?

26:04.583 --> 26:06.645
You better tell me
who it was.

26:06.647 --> 26:07.784
They're gonna figure it out.

26:07.786 --> 26:09.553
They're gonna find you,
you son of a bitch.

26:09.555 --> 26:11.393
This is your last chance.
Who was it?

26:11.395 --> 26:15.426
Maybe me and you
can share a cell someday.

26:26.744 --> 26:28.742
Oh, my--what happened?

26:28.744 --> 26:30.742
Son of a bitch
went berserk.

26:30.744 --> 26:32.246
Damn near
bit my nose off.

26:32.248 --> 26:33.677
I bopped him
pretty good,

26:33.679 --> 26:35.547
but I guess he must
have caught his head on the door

26:35.549 --> 26:36.913
or something
when he went down.

26:36.915 --> 26:38.049
Oh...

26:38.051 --> 26:40.216
We, uh, found all that
hidden in his cell.

26:40.218 --> 26:41.912
Oh, damn it.

26:41.914 --> 26:43.551
Warden: Go get that cut
taken care of.

26:43.553 --> 26:45.152
No, I'm good, sir.
I'd like to stay and help.

26:45.155 --> 26:46.825
Shavers,
you've done enough. Go.

26:46.826 --> 26:49.320
Captain, I'll meet you in the infirmary.
I have a few questions.

26:49.322 --> 26:52.052
All right. This won't take long.
I'll come find you.

26:52.054 --> 26:55.324
His name is Patrick Butler,
inmate number 312773.

26:55.326 --> 26:58.489
Found the same socks, same shanks.
This must be our guy.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.296
Well, warden, we profiled
this was the work of a group.

27:00.298 --> 27:03.262
If Butler was involved,
we've only found one of the killers.

27:03.264 --> 27:05.262
Well, I'm gonna go share
the news with corporate.

27:05.264 --> 27:07.197
They'll be happy
we're making progress.

27:08.167 --> 27:10.070
Was Butler
a violent criminal?

27:10.072 --> 27:12.405
Not until he came here.
He was doing 5 years

27:12.407 --> 27:15.171
for using a toy gun to rob 5 banks
in 3 different states,

27:15.173 --> 27:16.665
but his sentence
got bumped up to 20

27:16.667 --> 27:17.999
after he killed
another inmate.

27:18.002 --> 27:20.008
Just like Devon White.
Comes in nonviolent

27:20.009 --> 27:21.607
and then something
goes wrong.

27:25.010 --> 27:28.015
Hey, wait, guys,
look at the cell number.

27:28.017 --> 27:31.382
Maybe it's not 7 fingers,
maybe it's 3 on one hand,

27:31.384 --> 27:33.317
4 on the other. 34.

27:33.319 --> 27:38.217
Well, I wonder what else must have
happened down here.

27:38.219 --> 27:41.216
You really think
this Butler guy did it?

27:41.218 --> 27:43.017
It's possible.
And our profile

27:43.020 --> 27:44.858
may have led Shavers
right to it.

27:44.860 --> 27:47.226
But if this is about foul play, why would
Shavers want him dead?

27:47.227 --> 27:49.394
He may have known too much about
something the captain's trying to hide.

27:49.396 --> 27:51.665
You think the warden
knows about all this?

27:51.667 --> 27:54.969
I don't think so. I think he's just
trying to save his job.

27:57.137 --> 27:59.366
So what's our next move?

27:59.368 --> 28:02.300
We proceed as planned.
We keep conducting interviews

28:02.303 --> 28:04.308
until we find out what
happened to Devon White,

28:04.310 --> 28:06.005
and then we figure out
if Butler or Shavers

28:06.006 --> 28:07.973
had anything to do with it.

28:11.312 --> 28:13.918
Hello, Tom.

28:16.623 --> 28:19.118
I'm not gonna say anything.
I already told you that.

28:19.120 --> 28:23.620
[Chuckles] I know.
I was just saying hello.

28:23.622 --> 28:25.059
Oh, hey, you know...

28:25.061 --> 28:28.658
How is that beautiful
little girl of yours doing?

28:29.965 --> 28:33.268
She's gonna be 8 soon?

28:33.270 --> 28:35.299
That's a great age.

28:35.301 --> 28:37.136
Enjoy it. They grow quick.

28:37.138 --> 28:41.132
Next thing you know,
they're gone.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.752
Shavers just radioed.
He's on his way down.

28:54.753 --> 28:56.720
It's taking him
long enough.

28:56.722 --> 28:58.287
Have Garcia monitor
his cell phone.

28:58.289 --> 29:00.087
That way we'll know
if he tries to leave.

29:00.089 --> 29:01.623
You really think
he'll try and run?

29:01.625 --> 29:03.791
He might if he's got
something to hide.

29:03.793 --> 29:06.296
Mr. Ortiz, have a seat.

29:08.034 --> 29:11.673
I want to ask you a few questions
about Devon White.

29:11.674 --> 29:13.472
So you worked
on his cell block, right?

29:13.474 --> 29:15.776
When was the last time
you saw him?

29:15.778 --> 29:18.242
Do you remember
anything special about Devon?

29:18.244 --> 29:21.147
Oh, man, you got to be
kiddin' me.

29:21.149 --> 29:24.683
Well, of course I get
the affirmative action dude.

29:24.685 --> 29:27.691
Why couldn't you be
one of the chicks?

29:34.256 --> 29:36.022
It's ok if I call
you Tom?

29:36.025 --> 29:38.326
So you reported directly
to officer Rivers?

29:38.327 --> 29:40.093
He was my block commander.

29:43.135 --> 29:45.366
Do you remember
this inmate?

29:45.368 --> 29:48.237
Yeah, he looks familiar.

29:48.239 --> 29:51.141
Kate: You took him to the
infirmary 4 different times.

29:51.144 --> 29:53.806
His name's Devon White.

29:53.807 --> 29:55.677
He was on D-building.

29:55.679 --> 29:58.278
Yeah, yeah, Devon.
I remember him.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.486
Do you remember anything
about his transfer?

30:01.585 --> 30:04.352
How about the infirmary visits?

30:04.354 --> 30:07.024
Nope, uh, nothing.

30:11.064 --> 30:12.661
You ok?

30:12.663 --> 30:14.430
Would you like
some water?

30:14.432 --> 30:15.998
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.834
You know, Tom,

30:20.836 --> 30:24.536
well, it's just--
it's a little odd.

30:24.538 --> 30:27.441
Devon lived on
your cell block...

30:30.546 --> 30:33.776
And you saw him at least
5 times a week.

30:33.778 --> 30:38.280
But all you got is,
“Yeah, he looks familiar”?

30:40.554 --> 30:42.783
There's a lot of guys
on D-block.

30:42.785 --> 30:45.053
You mind?

30:45.055 --> 30:47.453
Ok, look, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here,

30:47.455 --> 30:51.022
because you seem like a man
who is scared and carrying a burden.

30:51.024 --> 30:53.695
Maybe it's just stress,
I don't know,

30:53.697 --> 30:55.799
but it seems like
you're hiding something

30:55.801 --> 30:57.936
and it's eating you up.

31:00.001 --> 31:03.504
Morgan: Is there something
you want to tell us, Tom?

31:03.506 --> 31:06.145
Something maybe about
cell number 34.

31:15.695 --> 31:18.896
You gotta keep
my daughter safe.

31:18.898 --> 31:21.001
Please.

31:29.079 --> 31:30.614
Hey, Weeks!

31:30.616 --> 31:32.583
I got a proposition for you.

31:32.586 --> 31:35.689
Shavers and his guys,
they're like their own little gang.

31:37.323 --> 31:40.298
Kate: What did they
do to Devon?

31:52.437 --> 31:54.973
We don't have
all day, Polinsky.

32:00.544 --> 32:04.213
1, 2, 3.

32:11.528 --> 32:14.462
They told me if I talked,
they'd hurt my daughter.

32:15.361 --> 32:18.801
Kate: Ok, Tom, how did
all this get started?

32:18.803 --> 32:21.906
They'd round up
a few inmates.

32:21.908 --> 32:23.138
Misfits.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.643
None of them affiliated.

32:24.645 --> 32:28.347
They'd pick the quiet ones 'cause
they knew they'd be weak.

32:29.813 --> 32:32.818
They made Devon
and Butler fight.

32:32.820 --> 32:36.756
Those two, I guess
they were, uh, close.

32:36.758 --> 32:38.694
Like more than friends.

32:38.696 --> 32:41.759
And when they refused,
come on now.

32:41.762 --> 32:45.466
They only got it worse
from Shavers and his gang.

32:45.467 --> 32:46.474
Get in there.

32:46.476 --> 32:48.538
Come on, mix it up.

32:49.539 --> 32:51.841
Get up!

32:53.011 --> 32:55.882
Take it.

32:55.884 --> 32:58.747
Take it.

32:58.749 --> 33:01.051
I wasn't supposed
to be down there,

33:01.054 --> 33:03.694
but I was looking
for Rivers.

33:13.642 --> 33:16.410
Polinsky.

33:28.856 --> 33:32.458
Devon's lying there,
all bloody,

33:32.460 --> 33:35.361
and Butler's freakin' out.

33:35.363 --> 33:38.927
Kate: They made you get rid
of the body so you were an accessory?

33:41.496 --> 33:42.830
[Crying]

33:42.833 --> 33:46.438
You helped them kill
Hightower, Rivers, and Jones, too?

33:47.703 --> 33:50.341
I couldn't kill anybody.

33:50.343 --> 33:56.242
It--it was Butler
and I don't know who else.

33:56.244 --> 33:59.378
And I just--I just got 'em
keys and stuff.

33:59.380 --> 34:01.608
Will you testify
to all this?

34:01.610 --> 34:03.614
Yeah.

34:04.983 --> 34:07.213
How was Randall
Jones involved?

34:07.215 --> 34:09.782
Jones, their lap dog,

34:09.784 --> 34:14.654
he'd help them out, round up guys,
get them information.

34:14.656 --> 34:16.655
Whatever they needed.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.466
Get him!

34:48.742 --> 34:50.635
Hold still.

34:56.509 --> 35:00.381
[Alarm]

35:20.276 --> 35:22.273
Aah!

35:43.968 --> 35:45.437
Ok!

35:45.439 --> 35:47.672
Ok.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.820
You lived in the cell
next to Devon, is that correct?

36:01.928 --> 36:03.410
Excuse me, agents.

36:03.434 --> 36:05.353
A personal body alarm
was activated in A-block,

36:05.354 --> 36:06.919
but we can't seem
to get access.

36:06.921 --> 36:08.918
A-block. That's where
Morgan and Kate are.

36:18.358 --> 36:19.356
Check it. Check it.

36:19.358 --> 36:21.125
Locked!

36:21.127 --> 36:23.885
You smell good.

36:24.822 --> 36:26.355
You get that bitch
under control!

36:26.357 --> 36:27.754
Just let her go, man.

36:27.756 --> 36:30.355
Oh, I like her.

36:30.357 --> 36:32.225
Handle it.
In here!

36:32.227 --> 36:33.855
Come on, let's move.

36:40.233 --> 36:41.367
Over there.

36:41.369 --> 36:43.534
Uhh!

36:43.536 --> 36:44.502
[Indistinct chatter]

36:44.504 --> 36:45.871
Gather 'round!

36:45.873 --> 36:48.738
I want everyone
to see this.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.042
Give me that.

36:50.044 --> 36:52.515
Do it.

36:52.517 --> 36:54.379
Hey, I want to have some fun
with this one first.

36:54.381 --> 36:55.347
Leave her alone!

36:55.349 --> 36:56.547
Hurry up!
This won't take long.

36:56.549 --> 36:57.955
Weeks!

36:58.885 --> 37:01.259
What the hell
you doin', man?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.628
Mind your business!

37:02.630 --> 37:04.060
I'm makin' it my business.

37:04.062 --> 37:05.364
This ain't your show.

37:05.366 --> 37:06.733

is from inside the booth.
