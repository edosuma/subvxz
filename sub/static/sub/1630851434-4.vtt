WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:16.541 --> 00:19.041
Fighters of land,

00:20.125 --> 00:21.958
sea and air!

00:22.666 --> 00:25.416
Blackshirts of the revolution
and of the legions,

00:25.916 --> 00:27.791
men and women of Italy,

00:28.416 --> 00:29.416
of the Empire

00:29.916 --> 00:33.125
and of the Kingdom of Albania. Listen!

00:33.708 --> 00:35.125
He's talking.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.208
The bell of destiny

00:48.291 --> 00:51.291
now peals across the sky
over our fatherland!

00:55.083 --> 00:56.291
Stella!

00:57.291 --> 00:58.416
-Stella!
-Stella!

00:58.916 --> 01:00.041
-Stella!
-What's wrong?

01:00.125 --> 01:03.666
-Say something, my love. Stella, come on!
-Is there a doctor here?

01:03.750 --> 01:05.000
…of irrevocable decisions!

01:05.083 --> 01:07.666
-Can somebody call a doctor?
-I'll take care of it.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.041
The declaration of war

01:10.125 --> 01:14.666
has already been delivered
to the ambassadors.

01:14.750 --> 01:19.125
The single order of the day is victory!

01:20.208 --> 01:22.666
…and our freedom!

01:22.750 --> 01:24.916
Shut up, morons!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.291
-You got a problem?
-You're the ones with problems!

01:27.375 --> 01:29.000
Oh yeah? We'll see about that.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.916
-Get your hands off me!
-Leave him alone!

01:33.041 --> 01:33.875
Stop it!

01:35.291 --> 01:36.916
Please, let's go.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.208
Miranda! Are you done? Can I come in?

01:54.750 --> 01:57.041
Stella. Are you feeling better?

01:58.083 --> 01:59.875
What's with all the secrecy?

01:59.958 --> 02:00.875
Hold on.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.916
My love,
don't drink that fizzy concoction.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.791
If you need medicine, I'll get it.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.875
She's not going to drink it! It's pee.

02:15.458 --> 02:16.875
And Stella is just fine.

02:17.916 --> 02:19.750
You're having a baby!

02:22.208 --> 02:24.250
I knew it! I could feel it!

02:26.250 --> 02:27.750
That's such good news!

02:27.833 --> 02:29.166
My love!

02:29.958 --> 02:31.208
Wait.

02:31.291 --> 02:34.416
Ettore! Come here!
You are going to be an uncle!

02:42.791 --> 02:45.375
We were so happy, that night.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.000
We didn't even care about the war anymore.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
We were happy, like a bunch of fools!

02:51.208 --> 02:53.583
Hold on.
Italy went to war in 1940, didn't it?

02:55.625 --> 02:58.083
That doesn't add up with my date of birth.

02:59.125 --> 03:02.041
If you want to know,
you have to listen to the whole story.

03:02.833 --> 03:07.000
First of all, your mother had
the bright idea of marrying a wanderer.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.791
He and your uncle Ettore
traveled the world.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.833
They were never around.
And with the war, it got even worse.

03:12.916 --> 03:14.875
Coming and going wasn't easy at all.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.083
PARIS

03:24.583 --> 03:28.250
Meanwhile, Stella and I made ends meet
with a few gigs at the circus.

03:28.916 --> 03:31.208
We sat there and watched the river go by.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.500
Pick a card, ma'am.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.375
We were doing card readings.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.291
And everything was fine.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.583
How are you feeling?

03:50.875 --> 03:53.250
My pregnant belly
was much bigger than yours.

03:54.875 --> 03:55.916
Mario.

04:00.666 --> 04:01.500
Thank you!

04:01.583 --> 04:03.541
It's the least I can do
for you and Antonio.

04:03.625 --> 04:07.583
Your mother waited for your father's
letters like a child at Christmas.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.875
She wrote and she wrote.

04:10.958 --> 04:14.750
But I don't know what they wrote about.
I minded my own business.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.083
My love,

04:19.166 --> 04:22.333
today I read the cards for a woman
who lost her son in the war.

04:22.416 --> 04:24.791
She wanted to know
if her other son will die too.

04:24.875 --> 04:25.958
He's missing.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.625
It was horrible.
I felt so bad for that poor woman.

04:28.708 --> 04:31.041
-Are you crazy? Get down!
-I wanted--

04:31.125 --> 04:34.666
Get down! You want to make it
do somersaults already? Go inside!

04:34.750 --> 04:35.750
My love,

04:35.833 --> 04:37.333
I hope it's a little girl.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.875
So she will never have to go to war.

04:39.958 --> 04:42.958
The situation is terrible everywhere.
People are starving.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.750
But when they watch our show, they laugh.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.166
I guess they need it.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.666
It's because they still want to be happy.

04:53.166 --> 04:56.750
I am happy when I think
about our little boy or girl.

04:56.833 --> 04:58.916
The cards say it's going to be a girl.

05:04.208 --> 05:08.291
Here in Paris, my love, doing our show
in the street is out of the question.

05:08.916 --> 05:11.166
The city is under occupation,
and it's scary.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.833
But we might have found a gig.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.458
There's this place
where they hire foreigners too.

05:29.958 --> 05:32.500
I hired another couple
of Italians yesterday

05:32.583 --> 05:35.500
that do practically
the same things as you.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.541
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

05:43.416 --> 05:45.375
Who are they? We know them all.

05:46.916 --> 05:48.208
The Petrucci Duo.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.291
-Husband and wife.
-Sure! They're friends.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.625
We traveled with them for a bit,
from Berlin.

05:53.708 --> 05:54.833
Can't you hire us too?

05:56.125 --> 05:58.583
This place is full of Germans,
and they don't pay.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.375
They come for the girls.

06:00.958 --> 06:04.125
Certainly not to see you
and your rubber hammers.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.375
It's a miracle I'm still in business.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.333
We could alternate.
Us and the Petruccis. One night each.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.500
Leave this place.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.583
This is no land of milk and honey.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.208
It's a city under occupation.

06:26.541 --> 06:30.000
Wow! You're getting so strong!
Come on, Celeste! You can beat me!

06:36.375 --> 06:37.458
So? How is it?

06:38.166 --> 06:40.458
Brings tears to my eyes, Tina.

06:41.458 --> 06:44.125
We've still got a few packs.
After that, I don't know.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.250
After that, snails.
That's what they eat here, you know?

06:47.333 --> 06:48.750
Do you like snails, Celeste?

06:48.833 --> 06:51.041
They're so yummy! Yummy!

06:52.125 --> 06:55.375
Thank you, my friends.
I haven't had a plate of pasta in months.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.583
The good news is we got a gig.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.166
-Is it well-paid?
-No, but at least they pay.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.083
-How about you guys?
-We--

07:04.166 --> 07:05.625
We found a gig too.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.083
-That's great news.
-Where?

07:09.458 --> 07:11.333
I still don't know my way around.

07:11.416 --> 07:13.250
Where is it, Ettore? The sixteenth?

07:23.250 --> 07:26.208
My love, the baby's kicking
like she's possessed.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.666
I don't think
she likes vegetables, you know?

07:28.750 --> 07:31.166
Anyway, everything's ready for her here.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.291
I sewed four rompers and a few socks.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.666
We've even managed
to make a little cradle.

07:35.750 --> 07:39.041
Now I can move on to the fun stuff
and make some toys for her.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.708
If you could send me some money
when you get paid…

07:41.791 --> 07:44.500
I wouldn't ask you
if things weren't going so bad here.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.125
There's not enough money, and I'm worried
about when our little girl arrives.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.875
Listen, heading north is too dangerous.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.291
Maybe we should cross over to Switzerland.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.250
No.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.541
We need a job now.

08:03.625 --> 08:07.041
What job?
The one you made up at Tina and Salvo's?

08:07.125 --> 08:10.250
Why? They're friends. You don't need
to defend your dignity with them.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.958
I wasn't worried about my dignity.
I need that job.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.958
For Stella. And most of all, for our baby.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.916
What do you mean?
They've got Celeste to look after too.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.541
-But they won't be safe in Paris.
-Why?

08:25.208 --> 08:28.208
-No one knows they're Jews.
-And no one's going to find out.

08:28.291 --> 08:29.333
Oh, good.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.875
-You scared me there.
-But I have to figure something out.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.333
What do you mean?

08:34.416 --> 08:38.083
We want to bring laughter and happiness
to the world. But you know what?

08:38.875 --> 08:41.250
There's no more peace for anyone, Ettore.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.333
"Mors tua, vita mea."

09:09.083 --> 09:10.791
It's a dirty move. Let's drop it.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.375
It's just a white lie.
They'll find work elsewhere.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.750
It'll be fine.

09:18.666 --> 09:21.750
-Hey! You came to cheer for us?
-No. Come on. There's no time.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.416
-What happened?
-They're coming to get you.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.666
-Why?
-What's going on?

09:26.750 --> 09:29.333
They know where you live and work,
that you're Jewish.

09:29.416 --> 09:33.458
No. That's not possible. I don't--
Who told you?

09:34.125 --> 09:36.416
The owner ratted on you
so he could stay open.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.833
I found out by chance.
It may already be too late.

09:38.916 --> 09:40.666
Let's go out the back! Hurry!

09:40.750 --> 09:43.000
-We have to go get Celeste.
-Yes.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.000
My love,

09:51.083 --> 09:53.208
there's a surprise in the envelope.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.250
And soon, I'll be able to send more.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.541
Buy some sweets for our little girl

09:58.625 --> 10:00.333
so she'll stop kicking.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.833
My love, unfortunately,
something terrible happened.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.416
I don't know why it happened.
I feel awful.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.583
I started losing blood the other night.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.166
Mom took me to the hospital. I'm fine now.

10:40.666 --> 10:43.208
But they said that the baby
wasn't breathing anymore.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.750
They took it out.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.541
MAILBOX
ROYAL POST

10:50.625 --> 10:52.375
It was a little boy.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.291
Would you hurry up, miss?

11:12.708 --> 11:15.500
As soon as he received that letter,
I don't know how,

11:15.583 --> 11:17.958
but Antonio managed to come back to Rome.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.666
-But this isn't my story.
-Hold on.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.708
-Grandma, please.
-Hear me out.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.875
Okay. Just don't take forever,
like you always do.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.375
Antonio really came through that time.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.958
I had never really liked him before.

11:32.541 --> 11:33.958
Because he was a wanderer.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.208
Here you are.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.375
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.375
But when he came running back,

11:59.458 --> 12:01.166
I started respecting him.

12:01.958 --> 12:03.333
He'd taken such a big risk.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.375
That meant he truly loved Stella.

12:59.708 --> 13:02.458
Enough with the long face. You promised.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.166
You look like a pony, you know?

13:07.208 --> 13:09.083
I'd already made some clothes.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.000
I worked on them every night.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.333
You shouldn't have sold them.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.625
Losing a child is not so uncommon.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.166
-We'll make another one.
-But how?

13:21.250 --> 13:22.416
You're never around.

13:23.125 --> 13:24.750
This has been my life forever.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.666
And you could come with us.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.375
What about my mother?
What would she do without me?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.416
She wanted a grandchild so badly.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.625
And she'll have one.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.458
Let's get right to work.

13:41.541 --> 13:42.958
That's easy for you to say.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.875
Do you ever think about our son, huh?

13:48.916 --> 13:50.291
Maybe too much, my love.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.958
I did something horrible in Paris
for our baby.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.333
You?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.250
What could you have done?

14:04.083 --> 14:05.041
I lied.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.000
To whom?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.125
It doesn't matter. Sooner or later,
I'll find a way to make up for it.

14:14.833 --> 14:15.833
What I mean is,

14:16.458 --> 14:18.250
our son wasn't even born yet,

14:18.791 --> 14:21.833
and I was already willing to do
anything for him.

14:29.708 --> 14:32.250
Near New York,
there's an amusement park by the sea

14:32.333 --> 14:35.250
with tons of rides. It's called Luna Park.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.375
It's so beautiful,
it makes you want to cry.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.833
I used to dream
that we'd go there together.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.333
You, me, and our baby.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.375
That sounds nice.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.375
Wouldn't it be fun to be carnies?

14:57.458 --> 15:00.291
No more traveling shows.
Just you and I, always together.

15:00.791 --> 15:01.625
And your mother.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.958
Just imagine how lucky

15:07.041 --> 15:09.666
and happy the children of carnies are.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.875
-I'll teach those kids a lesson!
-Cesare!

15:32.916 --> 15:35.208
Cesare, Canio! You're in for it!

15:36.041 --> 15:38.166
They'll destroy this place
before the bombs do.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.625
What bombs? You're safe here.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.375
I don't know, Antonio.
This war might go on a long time.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.166
And despite selling tickets
for next to nothing,

15:46.250 --> 15:48.083
I'm afraid we'll have to close soon.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.375
Yeah. And with all this going on

15:50.875 --> 15:53.041
he's going on
about building an amusement park!

15:53.125 --> 15:55.083
I don't mean now. Later.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.416
Once the war is over. Think about it.

15:57.916 --> 16:01.000
No more traveling and no more circus.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.541
You and all our friends
around the world together,

16:03.625 --> 16:04.833
in a real carnival.

16:04.916 --> 16:08.041
Stable rides, that you don't have to
take down every time.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.375
And then houses, little streets,

16:11.166 --> 16:13.416
like a little town just for us.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.875
Do you have any idea
how much those rides cost?

16:15.958 --> 16:19.625
Everyone can bring theirs. If you don't
have any, you can build them. We'll help.

16:19.708 --> 16:22.125
How will we get everybody here
to get along?

16:22.208 --> 16:24.583
Why is that?
Because we're always competing.

16:24.666 --> 16:25.916
"Mors tua, vita mea."

16:28.708 --> 16:30.583
There would be room for everyone.

16:30.666 --> 16:32.833
Everyone that wants
to make roots somewhere.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.583
But those who make roots
lose a bit of their soul.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.625
You can always keep traveling, then.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.708
You don't have to stay.

16:41.416 --> 16:42.791
What do you think, Mom?

16:43.375 --> 16:44.458
Does it sound crazy?

16:46.541 --> 16:48.708
I mean, it's not completely stupid.

16:48.791 --> 16:52.875
We'd have to take the business side
of things more seriously.

17:05.750 --> 17:06.625
Are you sure?

17:06.708 --> 17:09.041
You're the one
who made me want to do it again.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.875
And now you want to back out?

17:11.708 --> 17:12.625
Here?

17:12.708 --> 17:15.666
Yes. Everyone's out for lunch.
As long as we're quiet.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.000
Quiet? Easier said than done.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.708
You're never quiet, my love.

17:58.291 --> 18:02.750
And so your mom got pregnant again.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.458
Would you like a card reading?

18:04.541 --> 18:06.791
Antonio had to leave again with Ettore

18:06.875 --> 18:08.666
to put aside a bit more money.

18:08.750 --> 18:12.666
The traveling show was still better
than staying here and doing nothing.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.041
Stella and I did everything we could.

18:15.125 --> 18:18.125
Would you like us
to read your future, ma'am? Please, sit.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.708
But with the war,
it was hard for us to scrape by.

18:22.791 --> 18:25.083
You can't be here! Clear everything away!

18:27.041 --> 18:29.208
The Grottas had also decided to leave.

18:30.791 --> 18:33.125
We're leaving tomorrow.
You don't want to come?

18:33.208 --> 18:35.291
Where can she go in this state?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.916
Well, think about it.
There's room for all of us.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.083
They're coming too.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.500
I didn't even know
they were in Rome. Tina!

18:46.166 --> 18:48.416
Hey! How are you?

18:48.916 --> 18:51.625
I'm fine! Look at that belly!

18:54.416 --> 18:55.708
Hi, Celeste!

18:55.791 --> 18:57.166
You've gotten so big!

18:57.250 --> 19:00.083
We came to say hi.
And we really wanted to thank you too.

19:00.666 --> 19:01.500
For what?

19:01.583 --> 19:04.833
Last year in Paris,
someone reported us to the police.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.333
But your husband
tipped us off just in time.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.291
We could have all been deported.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.166
-He didn't tell me about it.
-Because he's a good man.

19:14.666 --> 19:15.791
So where's Salvo?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.666
The night we ran away

19:26.750 --> 19:29.333
the police stopped our caravan
at a checkpoint.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.041
They asked a lot of questions.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.666
Salvo got out to show them our papers,

19:36.291 --> 19:38.541
but he got scared and he reacted,

19:39.416 --> 19:40.583
so they shot him.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.791
They just left him lying there
on the ground.

19:45.583 --> 19:46.791
Worse than a dog.

19:48.541 --> 19:49.625
Are you all right?

19:52.125 --> 19:54.083
She seemed to be doing fine.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.750
But then it happened again.

20:23.541 --> 20:26.500
Maybe it was because
we didn't have enough to eat.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.750
Or because of all the worrying.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.541
Whatever it was, she miscarried again.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.500
And Stella…

20:42.250 --> 20:45.666
lost all her confidence and her strength.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.833
She would lie in bed forever.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.083
She was sad and wouldn't budge.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.958
I tried to keep working

20:58.291 --> 20:59.875
and carried the burden.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.291
Because that's what a mother does.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.375
I don't get it.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.750
I remember my mom, she was always…

21:10.333 --> 21:11.208
cheerful.

21:11.833 --> 21:14.375
She'd jump out of bed
even when she was sick.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.458
Because she had you.

21:17.583 --> 21:18.833
Back then, she didn't.

21:19.416 --> 21:20.791
It was terrible.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.708
Everyone has lots of kids.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.250
Why can't we?

21:31.291 --> 21:34.750
And the worst thing was that Antonio
had vanished, he stopped writing.

21:34.833 --> 21:36.416
There was war everywhere.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.208
We thought something bad
had happened to him.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.500
But your mother kept writing to him.

21:44.208 --> 21:47.041
Even though the address
was surely wrong by then.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.583
And I kept wondering,
"What is she writing about?"

21:50.833 --> 21:53.625
"There is really nothing
to talk about these days."

22:09.416 --> 22:11.250
Are you out of your fucking mind?

22:12.250 --> 22:13.250
Are you listening?

22:13.333 --> 22:15.833
-Why all those fucking lies?
-Don't yell at me.

22:15.916 --> 22:18.333
-How long has this shit been going on?
-Stop it.

22:18.416 --> 22:21.041
Why didn't you tell him
you lost the child?

22:21.125 --> 22:23.250
Now he thinks you have a daughter.

22:23.333 --> 22:25.416
What is this? You taught her to walk?

22:25.500 --> 22:28.791
She calls you mom? What the fuck?
This child doesn't even exist!

22:28.875 --> 22:30.750
Why don't you mind your own business?

22:31.916 --> 22:32.833
Oh my God.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.250
Oh God. My daughter has lost her mind.
That's all we needed.

22:40.416 --> 22:43.291
Mom, Antonio hasn't written back
in more than a year!

22:43.791 --> 22:44.708
He's dead!

22:44.791 --> 22:47.000
You can't just lose hope like that.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.291
At least I can write whatever I want!

22:50.750 --> 22:52.208
But it's just a fantasy.

22:53.166 --> 22:55.375
You even gave this little girl a name.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.916
Why do that? "Nora"?

22:59.458 --> 23:00.791
There's no Nora.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.541
So what?
We live in a world of fantasy these days.

23:03.625 --> 23:05.208
What's left of real life, huh?

23:05.708 --> 23:07.583
You and I eating weeds?

23:07.666 --> 23:11.916
The beautiful children that I don't have,
or Antonio, who's dead God knows where?

23:12.541 --> 23:13.750
Real life is hell!

23:13.833 --> 23:15.208
How would you know?

23:15.291 --> 23:17.791
You've been hiding in here for ages!

23:17.875 --> 23:20.416
In the real world,
people are fighting injustice

23:20.500 --> 23:21.625
with endless courage!

23:21.708 --> 23:23.500
I read the papers, you know?

23:23.583 --> 23:26.000
And they say that
the whole world is dying,

23:26.083 --> 23:27.541
just like my two babies!

23:27.625 --> 23:30.666
Both of them!
And there won't be another one.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.125
It's all over.

23:32.958 --> 23:34.708
Let me have my Nora, at least.

23:40.458 --> 23:41.583
I don't understand.

23:42.208 --> 23:44.666
It's a good thing you don't, my love.

23:46.083 --> 23:47.916
Those were the darkest times ever.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.833
But where do I come into this whole story?
What happened?

23:50.916 --> 23:52.416
I got fed up of all that shit.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.750
And what do you do in dark times?

23:54.833 --> 23:56.666
What does your grandma always tell you?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.208
You turn on the light.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.375
You need to get your mind off things.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.708
Even you wearing clean clothes
is like a miracle.

24:05.791 --> 24:07.666
Now, let's have a good meal.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.708
-How much is this going to cost us?
-Don't worry about it.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.291
Do you want more bread?

24:16.375 --> 24:17.291
Yes, thank you.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.750
I'm not paying for this slop!

24:21.833 --> 24:23.791
Ma'am, this is all we've got.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.708
You're lucky we're still open.

24:25.791 --> 24:29.208
I've been dreaming about this for months,
but it was nothing like this glop.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.666
Ma'am, Mussolini ate here.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.708
Who cares?
He must be used to eating this slop.

24:33.791 --> 24:35.416
-My daughter and I are not.
-I see.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.208
You just don't want to pay.

24:37.708 --> 24:40.208
But it won't work with me, okay?

24:40.291 --> 24:42.958
That's enough,
or he's going to spit in our food.

24:43.041 --> 24:46.375
Well, I hope he does,
maybe then it'll taste like something.

24:47.666 --> 24:48.958
Don't touch me!

24:49.458 --> 24:51.083
Let go of me!

24:51.625 --> 24:53.333
What an asshole!

24:53.416 --> 24:55.458
Get lost, you tramp!

24:55.541 --> 24:56.666
WINE AND OIL

24:56.750 --> 25:00.166
Damn fascist bastard!

25:00.708 --> 25:02.416
You and your thug friends--

25:02.500 --> 25:03.875
What the fuck is going on?

25:03.958 --> 25:05.083
-Move!
-No.

25:05.166 --> 25:06.500
-Let us through!
-No!

25:08.416 --> 25:10.666
-We want bread!
-No!

25:39.083 --> 25:41.208
NO JEWS ALLOWED

26:12.000 --> 26:13.916
There's a baby girl in here.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.333
-Did they just leave her alone?
-She's not alone.

26:17.416 --> 26:19.291
I'm sure there's someone there.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.708
Hey. Hi, little one. Hi.

26:21.791 --> 26:23.083
Hey.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.958
Mom.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.208
Wait. Where are you going?

26:32.291 --> 26:33.416
Wait!

26:35.000 --> 26:37.041
Wait. Where are you going? Wait.

26:39.125 --> 26:41.125
-They locked her in there.
-Now what?

26:54.916 --> 26:57.000
Hey. Hi.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.833
Hey, sweetie.

27:02.833 --> 27:03.875
Hi.

27:05.125 --> 27:05.958
Hi.

27:13.541 --> 27:15.125
I'm not leaving her here.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.666
Let's look for her mom.
She must be around here.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.750
No mother would leave
her daughter like this.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.291
A miracle.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.083
It really was a miracle.

27:56.416 --> 27:57.916
But if your parents were rich,

27:58.500 --> 28:01.208
what were you doing
in that basement in Garbatella?

28:01.958 --> 28:03.416
ADELE GABRIELLI MISSING

28:03.500 --> 28:05.375
So I told myself, "Too bad for them!"

28:05.458 --> 28:06.708
Do you want it?

28:06.791 --> 28:08.125
"They weren't careful."

28:09.416 --> 28:11.791
Eat it slowly.
It's the last one we've got.

28:11.875 --> 28:14.250
And then there was the fact
that you were twins.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.375
Stella couldn't have even one baby,

28:17.916 --> 28:20.125
and that rich lady
could make two at a time.

28:22.083 --> 28:25.416
If we took you to the police,
the reward would have changed our lives.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.166
So?

28:30.791 --> 28:31.625
Any news?

28:32.666 --> 28:33.625
Nothing.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.208
I checked twice.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.916
We spent five lire for nothing.

28:42.125 --> 28:43.166
Oh well.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.916
Let's at least put it to some use.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.166
Where is Grandma going? Call on her.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.208
Stella was so happy.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.875
I used to think
she'd never be happy again.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.750
So I thought, "It's magical."

29:00.791 --> 29:01.708
"It's destiny."

29:01.791 --> 29:03.416
It's called kidnapping.

29:06.416 --> 29:07.416
If anything,

29:08.833 --> 29:10.666
someone else had kidnapped you.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.500
That man, the tall one.
He was shady, I'm telling you.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.083
We saved you.

29:18.750 --> 29:19.583
Listen.

29:21.333 --> 29:23.583
Your mother was miserable,
you were miserable.

29:23.666 --> 29:25.916
A second later, you were both smiling.

29:26.541 --> 29:29.041
The way you acted,
you looked like her daughter.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.333
You were so comfortable.

29:30.916 --> 29:32.708
So you never told her who I was?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.375
You're the child
of those who raised you with love.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.750
Listen to your grandma.

29:43.416 --> 29:46.291
Our luck turned that very day.
It was no accident.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.416
Some spirit up there

29:49.125 --> 29:50.791
was lending us a hand.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.416
Then your father wrote.
He was safe in America. Don't you get it?

29:54.500 --> 29:56.916
Yes, but you two pretended
everything was normal.

29:57.458 --> 29:58.833
No one could know.

29:59.333 --> 30:00.375
Not even him.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.666
You know you can come whenever you want.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.458
This is where I want to die, okay?

30:08.500 --> 30:11.083
But I'll be worried
if you're here all alone.

30:11.166 --> 30:12.416
Don't worry.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.333
I can take care of myself.

30:14.833 --> 30:17.208
But you can't come back.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.791
With that birthmark on her back,
we can't take any chances.

30:20.875 --> 30:23.041
What chances? They abandoned her.

30:23.125 --> 30:26.666
What if they change their mind?
You don't know what really happened.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.250
Time to leave!

30:32.375 --> 30:33.833
Even if you miss me…

30:37.291 --> 30:38.583
don't come back.

30:40.958 --> 30:42.791
Do it for me, okay?

30:51.541 --> 30:52.416
Bye.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.083
Bye, Grandma.

30:57.000 --> 30:57.916
Bye.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.541
I was alone.

31:29.416 --> 31:30.916
All alone, under the bombs.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.916
THE GABRIELLIS OFFER REWARD
WORTH MILLIONS

31:33.000 --> 31:37.041
And I'll tell you, following their lives
kept me company somehow.

31:39.791 --> 31:42.875
I just wanted to be sure
I hadn't ruined their lives.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.500
But the Gabriellis…

31:45.791 --> 31:48.583
they were just fine,
holed up in that villa for the whole war.

31:48.666 --> 31:50.083
They made a fortune.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.083
After a while,
they even had another child.

31:55.541 --> 31:56.916
Giggetto, I think.

31:58.583 --> 32:02.500
SIX MONTHS AGO
THEIR DAUGHTER WAS KIDNAPPED

32:10.583 --> 32:12.041
And you were finally

32:13.166 --> 32:14.458
safe and sound

32:15.166 --> 32:16.208
in America.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.541
It must have been an awful fire, huh?

32:36.625 --> 32:37.833
Such a shame.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.708
Let's go back to Rome.

32:42.875 --> 32:44.833
I'd like Nora to put down some roots.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.375
She seems to be doing just fine here.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.416
There she is. Hey, Mildred!

33:12.750 --> 33:14.375
What did she say?

33:14.458 --> 33:16.750
She'll have to start traveling again.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.250
Fire.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.458
Well, you're used to
being on the road, right?

33:31.416 --> 33:34.416
She's very famous. She's a tattoo artist.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.833
Antonio, can you ask her if a little girl
like her can also get a tattoo?

33:46.833 --> 33:48.458
Ask her if it's dangerous.

33:48.541 --> 33:51.791
She already has a butterfly on her back.
Why not make it more colorful?

33:53.291 --> 33:55.000
Thanks to that tattoo,

33:55.583 --> 33:57.458
your mother decided to come back.

33:58.291 --> 34:00.958
I knew the truth,
so it didn't seem like much to me.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.291
But it worked for years, until now.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.041
Who came looking for you? Tell me.

34:07.125 --> 34:08.208
No one.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.708
I found your scrapbook.

34:11.625 --> 34:13.625
-I figured it out by myself.
-Yeah, sure.

34:14.625 --> 34:16.875
It's that dandy
who's flirting with you, isn't it?

34:16.958 --> 34:18.625
He's got nothing to do with it.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.333
You were a happy child, weren't you?

34:30.375 --> 34:33.750
You laughed! I saw you!

34:37.458 --> 34:40.708
No, stop! Please, stop!
Let me catch my breath!

34:40.791 --> 34:41.791
Why?

34:42.291 --> 34:44.791
Because Mommy gets really tired lately.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.833
But it was all based on your lies.

35:22.458 --> 35:25.625
If you have to blame someone,
leave your mother out of it.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.958
At one point,
she even regretted what she did.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.875
Where are you going?

35:35.666 --> 35:37.916
I wonder what happened to her real mother.

35:39.083 --> 35:41.166
She's sitting here, next to me.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.041
Got you!

35:45.375 --> 35:47.458
-I'm dying.
-Stop it!

35:51.958 --> 35:53.833
And Nora's still too young.

35:59.583 --> 36:03.500
Maybe her mother had a good reason
for leaving her there alone.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Maybe we should look for her.

36:11.416 --> 36:13.833
She shouldn't grow up without a mother.

36:15.250 --> 36:16.250
What about me?

36:18.458 --> 36:19.916
And Antonio?

36:20.000 --> 36:23.375
You want them to take away
our little girl too?

36:24.458 --> 36:26.416
Now that you're…

36:33.125 --> 36:35.541
I just want to know what really happened.

36:39.208 --> 36:40.500
You'll never know.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.208
Make peace, honey.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.166
Got you! I got you!

36:50.666 --> 36:52.083
Why didn't you tell her?

36:53.833 --> 36:55.708
We are your family.

36:56.416 --> 36:58.041
What about the Gabriellis?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.958
The Gabriellis…

37:00.708 --> 37:02.166
I met them, you know?

37:02.708 --> 37:06.416
After the war, I was helping the Grottas.
They were back with their circus.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.250
And one day,
it turned out that Mr. Gabrielli

37:10.333 --> 37:12.333
wanted something delivered to his house.

37:12.916 --> 37:14.500
So I offered to go.

37:15.416 --> 37:16.375
I was curious.

37:17.541 --> 37:19.250
Guess what he wanted from the circus.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.583
Are you from the circus?

37:27.375 --> 37:29.500
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, good!

37:30.083 --> 37:32.666
Here we are. Finally.

37:33.208 --> 37:34.041
Is it in there?

37:34.125 --> 37:36.291
-With all due respect.
-Yes?

37:36.375 --> 37:39.166
What do you need a Bengal tiger for?

37:39.250 --> 37:41.958
It's a present for my son.
It's his birthday.

37:42.041 --> 37:44.125
He'll love it. A nice tiger cub.

37:44.208 --> 37:47.125
But it's not a toy, you know?
It's a carnivorous animal

37:47.208 --> 37:49.708
that will see your son
as a tasty, tender mouthful.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.625
Don't worry about that. We'll train it.

37:51.708 --> 37:54.375
We also have a huge garden here.
It'll feel at home.

37:54.458 --> 37:58.166
Do you have any idea what a cub
will become in a couple of months?

37:58.250 --> 38:00.375
-It'll become a tiger.
-Exactly, a tiger.

38:00.458 --> 38:03.291
Don't ask too many questions.
Just do as I say.

38:03.375 --> 38:06.166
-Get it out.
-Keep calm. Calm down. Be quiet.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.041
-Keep calm.
-Be careful, huh?

38:09.125 --> 38:11.083
Of course. Be careful. Stand still.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.875
-I have to stand still?
-Of course.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.458
-Is it calm?
-Well, we can't know.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.208
-Stay still.
-Is it sleeping?

38:21.291 --> 38:22.250
No.

38:24.291 --> 38:26.291
-Has it already eaten?
-Of course.

38:28.208 --> 38:29.083
Buddy.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.458
Come here, buddy. Come on.

38:32.625 --> 38:34.541
-There it is.
-Be careful.

38:34.625 --> 38:35.458
Yes.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.041
Here you go.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.416
-But that's a cat.
-Of course it's a cat.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.791
Don't worry though. He's all cleaned up.

38:45.875 --> 38:48.833
No, wait. I don't get it.
Where is the tiger I paid for?

38:48.916 --> 38:51.458
The Grottas will give you your money back.

38:51.958 --> 38:52.875
Maybe.

38:53.458 --> 38:57.125
But this is
the fiercest beast you can keep.

38:57.208 --> 39:00.875
Easy, though, huh?
Remember to treat it well.

39:01.916 --> 39:03.208
Goodbye.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.583
A moron.

39:06.666 --> 39:08.666
That guy's such a moron.

39:08.750 --> 39:11.500
As of that moment,
I stopped having regrets, my love.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.250
Those people didn't deserve you.

39:13.875 --> 39:16.083
Unlike them,
we earned everything we've got.

39:19.833 --> 39:20.875
Hey.

39:22.375 --> 39:25.875
-What are you two doing up at dawn?
-Just chatting.

39:25.958 --> 39:28.875
Did you hear the wind last night?
Ettore's canopy flew off.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.333
Will you give us a hand?

39:39.208 --> 39:40.125
What's going on?

39:41.833 --> 39:43.041
Nothing.

39:43.125 --> 39:44.458
It's just the wind.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.833
