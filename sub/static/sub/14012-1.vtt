<i> In the criminal justice system</i>

00:02.919 --> 00:05.203
<i> the people are represented</i>
<i> by two separate</i>

00:05.206 --> 00:06.572
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:08.474
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:11.310
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:14.013
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:15.547
This isn't a criticism, Mike.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.583
Oh? I guess
I'm hypersensitive.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.151
It probably
won't hurt us.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.552
My point its,
Ben was trying

00:20.554 --> 00:23.322
to get a straight
laundry list.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.057
That's what I gave.

00:25.059 --> 00:28.060
I pinch-hit for Max
in a grand jury

00:28.062 --> 00:30.429
I present the case
the way we reviewed it.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.563
Now you're...

00:31.565 --> 00:33.165
Come on, man. Chill.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.068
Tomorrow, when we
ask you to name names

00:36.070 --> 00:37.569
don't go on
about kickbacks

00:37.571 --> 00:39.571
and stolen copper pipes
and mangos.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.075
Mungo, not mangos.<i> Mungo.</i>

00:43.077 --> 00:45.077
I think everybody knows

00:45.079 --> 00:47.179
that's extra building material
that just disappears.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.081
And it ends up

00:49.083 --> 00:50.482
in somebody else's building.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.085
We didn't pick the grand jurors.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.121
Your crash course in corruption
went over their heads.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.057
Well, so what?

00:58.059 --> 01:01.493
So, they get too confused,
they may throw up their hands.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.594
Relax.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.597
You're going to get
your indictments.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.199
Max is back tomorrow.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.201
He's gonna give you
what you want:

01:09.203 --> 01:12.104
Howard Neffer,
Jimmy "The Mope" Donofrio

01:12.106 --> 01:12.671
Morgan Stern.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.107
I'll call him later.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.209
We'll go over the case notes

01:17.211 --> 01:18.477
and then....

01:18.479 --> 01:22.281
I'm going out frooging
with Patsy Kelley.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.255
He's still rummaging around
in the trunk.

01:30.257 --> 01:34.460
You know Max--
always losing his paperwork.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.362
Can you tell him
to light a fire under it?

01:37.364 --> 01:38.630
Dinner getting cold?

01:38.632 --> 01:41.133
No, my date's getting cold.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.601
I'm still at the office.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.870
It's like being married
to a ghost.

01:44.872 --> 01:49.408
Now he's out there gabbing
with somebody.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.110
Who's he gabbing to?

01:51.112 --> 01:52.111
I don't know.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.278
It's dark.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.448
Matthew, go tell your father
to hurry up.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.717
Okay, mom.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.185
What is this?

02:00.187 --> 02:01.520
Marie?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.122
Mary, mother of God!

02:03.124 --> 02:06.291
(<i> gunshots</i> )

02:06.293 --> 02:07.659

05:10.411 --> 05:12.044
MAN:
Two!

05:39.340 --> 05:41.640
I'll testify
as soon as you need me.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.875
I can take over
Max's testimony as well.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.711
The grand jury
will be suspended.

05:45.713 --> 05:49.414
You'll include Max's murder
as part of the offering, right?

05:49.416 --> 05:51.049
If we find anything
substantive

05:51.051 --> 05:52.784
but so far nothing.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.354
LOGAN:
The night before
his grand jury testimony?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.656
Somebody didn't like
the sound of it.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.924
I'd like the list

05:58.926 --> 06:00.359
of pending indictments.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.461
STONE:
We should find out

06:02.463 --> 06:04.830
who knew of those indictments
in our office.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.466
What about
a grand juror leak?

06:07.468 --> 06:10.769
Let's check their ties
to the construction industry.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.771
If word on the grand jury

06:12.773 --> 06:15.674
or a list of indictments
got out

06:15.676 --> 06:18.043
why hit Max--
the lead on the task force?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.045
They already hit
the leading investigator

06:20.047 --> 06:21.747
from the building department.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.883
That was an open
investigation, right?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.686
What were they
going to accomplish by that?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.988
These people
are not long-term planners.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.792
Two in the back,
one in the face.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.528
That's not a pro...

06:36.530 --> 06:39.798
not a thinker.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.707
The purpose of this
little get-together

06:48.709 --> 06:52.043
is<i> not</i> to bust your chops,
as you put it.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.946
It's to help you accept
your partner's...

06:54.948 --> 06:56.047
I accept it.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.516
Boom-- he's dead.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.184
That's the end of story.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.987
Also, to help
the officer in trouble

07:01.989 --> 07:04.423
reach a sense
of closure.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.725
First, I'm not in trouble.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.093
Okay?

07:08.095 --> 07:11.096
Matter of fact,
I'm alive and on the case.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.732
Secondly, I'm Irish-Catholic.

07:13.734 --> 07:17.068
I got a sense of closure
at Max's wake.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.109
Well then, there's no problem.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.744
That's right.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.179
Can I go now?

07:34.021 --> 07:36.021
Listen, thanks a lot

07:36.023 --> 07:38.123
but, really, I'm fine.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.992
Hey, Detective...

07:40.994 --> 07:43.528
ever hear
of the seven stages of grief?

07:43.530 --> 07:44.863
No.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.033
The first one's denial.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.970
I'm fine.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.586
Mike?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.870
You know Phil Cerreta
from the three-nine?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.238
I know him by name.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.973
He's handling Max's case.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.242
I saw him at the crime scene.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.043
He's thinking
about coming over.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.179
Maybe as second whip.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.148
So?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.851
So he asked about you.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.920
How would you feel?

08:44.892 --> 08:45.891
Fine.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.892
I mean, whatever.

08:46.894 --> 08:47.893
I don't care.

08:47.895 --> 08:48.994
Same rank as Max.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.530
Pick of cases and...

08:51.532 --> 08:54.199
That means he's bringing
Max's shooting with him?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.934
I would assume so.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.168
Then I'm on this case.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.837
Mike...

08:58.839 --> 09:01.840
I got to be concerned
about your objectivity.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.875
Then put Cerreta
on point.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.711
Mike...

09:05.712 --> 09:07.546
Who else is going
to interview these people?

09:07.548 --> 09:08.914
It doesn't matter.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.917
You're still due time
on a desk.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.002
(<i> sighs</i> )

09:32.039 --> 09:33.905
So...

09:33.907 --> 09:36.174
What?

09:36.176 --> 09:40.979
How you doing with this?

09:40.981 --> 09:44.115
I'm fine.

09:51.124 --> 09:55.060
ROBINETTE:
<i> that makes sense.name</i>

09:57.898 --> 10:00.899
Magadan, Dan Sr.--
retired construction?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.901
It's a good possibility.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.269
It gets better.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.605
Check his pension ties.

10:06.607 --> 10:10.075
Pull everything
you can on him.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.914
Your pension fund is vested
with Local 139.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.317
It's hard to believe
you didn't know any of the names

10:19.319 --> 10:22.053
offered for indictment
in that room.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.289
I had heard
of a few, maybe

10:24.291 --> 10:26.658
but they were
just names.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.361
I don't know them.

10:29.363 --> 10:32.631
You know any people who do?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.132
Not that I know of.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.068
Two of them
are on the governing board

10:37.070 --> 10:38.136
of that local.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.005
I haven't been active for years.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.973
My pension's there.
That's all.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.142
Still,
if you had mentioned anything

10:44.144 --> 10:46.645
even out of a sense
of loyalty...

10:46.647 --> 10:48.680
I didn't say anything.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.217
Mr. Magadan

10:52.219 --> 10:54.653
we're not talking
about loyalties

10:54.655 --> 10:56.321
and pension funds.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.123
We're talking about

10:58.125 --> 10:59.958
the killing of a man

10:59.960 --> 11:02.661
who had 23 years
on the job

11:02.663 --> 11:05.664
and we're talking about
his wife and his children

11:05.666 --> 11:07.732
who will spend months,
maybe years

11:07.734 --> 11:10.368
trying to come to terms
with the fact

11:10.370 --> 11:12.137
that he is gone.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.372
Look, we're not assessing blame.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.441
We just need some help.

11:16.443 --> 11:20.145
We've got to know
whether you said anything.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.980
I didn't. I swear.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.782
Nothing was said.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.430
Captain tells me
we're partnering.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.765
Yeah.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.737
I'm sorry about Max.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.338
Yeah.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.076
Listen, uh...

11:51.078 --> 11:52.711
Phil.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.747
I know you're the new whip
and everything...

11:55.749 --> 11:58.750
Look, Mike,
you know all the players

11:58.752 --> 12:01.052
in this copper business.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.420
I need you on point.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.255
Okay.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.058
Okay. Okay.

12:11.231 --> 12:15.300
<i> You, Stern, Neffer,</i>
<i> you were all indicted,</i>

12:15.302 --> 12:19.337
and you don't know anything
about the special investigator

12:19.339 --> 12:22.240
that got tossed down
on 48th street?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.743
Yeah, well, sure.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.245
Everybody's heard about it,
but I don't know nothing.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.149
I want you to think about it,
because I got a hundred bucks

12:31.151 --> 12:34.252
that says the guys
that threw him off the roof

12:34.254 --> 12:37.255
are the same ones
that killed my partner.

12:37.257 --> 12:42.360
I swear, Detective,
I'm just a salesman.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.496
Well, he seems okay
to me.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.497
Yeah.

12:45.499 --> 12:48.099
Maybe a few degrees too cool.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.467
Another hothead.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.170
Another mick--
your lot in life.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.471
Yeah, well

12:53.473 --> 12:56.174
Max was not exactly
Mr. Mellow.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.244
I can imagine
these two guys together.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.179
They did fine.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.318
You and Mike get a list
of the indictees?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.187
Yeah. Tomorrow.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.457
Mike and I are going
out tomorrow on a couple.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.325
I restore old buildings.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.795
I consider myself
a conservator

13:16.797 --> 13:18.797
of the city's
architectural heritage.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.332
(<i> bangs pipe</i> )

13:21.334 --> 13:24.202
Is this part
of your conservatorship?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.237
It's pipe.
What do you want?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.340
All kosher, Howie?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.342
We hear it's stolen.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.478
Show me a search warrant.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.248
You think we're loading
damn pipe in our trunk?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.350
We don't need
a search warrant.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.820
We'll get you
an<i> arrest</i> warrant.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.822
Tell me what you want.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.356
the secret grand jury
Somebody on

13:45.358 --> 13:47.258
his mouth shut.
couldn't keep

13:47.260 --> 13:49.227
We believe that information

13:49.229 --> 13:52.230
led to the murder
of Detective Logan's partner.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.867
Why me? I don't know
anything about that.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.304
You supplied a lot of pipe
to the 48th Street project--

13:59.306 --> 14:02.273
the one they tossed
Inspector Janklow off.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.243
I had nothing to do
with that, man.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.279
Who did?

14:08.281 --> 14:09.881
Ask Morgan Stern.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.482
He told me to...

14:14.221 --> 14:18.289
He told you what?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.359
To keep my mouth shut
about the leak.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.466
STERN:
Look, I want immunity
on anything

14:28.468 --> 14:30.501
that may come of this.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.871
And I want to know

14:32.873 --> 14:34.639
where you got
the grand jury information.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.242
You stated to Detectives
Cerreta and Logan

14:37.244 --> 14:39.277
that you warned Howard Neffer

14:39.279 --> 14:42.280
to keep his mouth shut
about the leak.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.283
I want to know
who that leak is.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.018
All right.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.554
How about immunity
on the copper theft?

14:49.556 --> 14:53.258
Five more seconds of this,
and you'll need immunity

14:53.260 --> 14:54.359
on more than that.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.960
My project manager.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.395
His name!

15:02.202 --> 15:04.202
Magadan.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.204
ROBINETTE:
Magadan?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.906
The old man?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.574
No. His son.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.676
Daniel Magadan, Jr.

15:11.678 --> 15:16.014
The grand jury foreman
told his son.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.387
I'll be a son of a bitch.

15:25.525 --> 15:29.027
We're not interested
in why you lied.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.629
We need to know
why you told your son

15:31.631 --> 15:33.531
about the grand jury.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.968
He said he had a friend
who wanted to know

15:36.970 --> 15:39.470
what the grand jury was getting.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.940
I said if his friend
was mixed up

15:41.942 --> 15:43.207
in something
like that

15:43.209 --> 15:44.609
it was none
of his business.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.512
That's all?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.514
I told him
this Detective Greevey

15:49.516 --> 15:51.516
was going to name names

15:51.518 --> 15:54.452
and I hoped to God "Magadan"
wasn't one of them.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.654
Where is your son now,
Mr. Magadan?

15:56.656 --> 15:58.623
I don't know.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.995
That I swear. I don't.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.670
Look, I ain't got...

16:12.672 --> 16:15.606
Just... two minutes.

16:23.016 --> 16:26.284
These Danny's friends?

16:26.286 --> 16:29.187
The ones he's covering for?

16:32.625 --> 16:37.028
If he's protecting someone,
it's wrong.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.565
You know it's wrong.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.168
My partner died
because you opened your mouth

16:44.170 --> 16:46.304
on the grand jury.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.510
I'm not going away.

16:52.512 --> 16:57.515
Somebody's got
to do something right.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.554
Danny came to me
about the grand jury.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.124
Pumped me for info.

17:06.126 --> 17:11.662
He said it was for a friend,
but...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.331
maybe there
was no friend.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.633
What do you mean?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.101
I don't know.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.636
I...

17:18.638 --> 17:21.773
If you're saying your
son killed my partner

17:21.775 --> 17:24.675
every cop in this city
will be gunning for him.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.620
His best bet is with me.

17:35.622 --> 17:40.158
Any other cop,
the odds go down to 50/50.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.729
Your word you won't hurt him?

17:45.698 --> 17:48.166
I promise.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.719
Hey, Danny.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.200
Freeze!

18:27.140 --> 18:28.406
On your head.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.208
On your head!

18:35.148 --> 18:37.815
The name Max Greevey
ring a bell?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.418
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.821
Did you kill my partner
to shut him up?

18:43.823 --> 18:44.889
No.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.357
No?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.159
No.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.164
Get on your knees.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.665
What?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.435
I said
get on your knees.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.712
This is how you did my partner,
isn't it?

19:07.714 --> 19:11.382
I swear, I didn't kill nobody.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.193
I don't believe you.

19:22.195 --> 19:29.267
I'm just going to ask you
one more time, Danny boy.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.737
Oh, God...

19:32.739 --> 19:34.739
(<i> crying</i> )

19:34.741 --> 19:37.275
Please, pl...

19:41.681 --> 19:43.748
I did it, okay?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.950
I did it.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.429
You do understand

19:58.431 --> 20:00.698
you have the right
to an attorney?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.366
You maintain you've
passed on that right.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.869
Yeah, I understand.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.371
I've been through all this
already with that psychotic.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.374
We'll just go over it
again for the record.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.777
You don't mind,
do you, Mr. Magadan?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.844
No.

20:13.846 --> 20:17.782
Will you tell me
something?

20:17.784 --> 20:20.384
How did you find out

20:20.386 --> 20:22.787
where Sergeant Greevey
lived?

20:22.789 --> 20:27.525
Some chick my cousin knows
who works at the D.M.V.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.927
It's not that tough.

20:29.929 --> 20:34.799
So I went out there,
and I parked across the street.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.401
Then you
got out of your car...

20:37.403 --> 20:38.869
and you shot him.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.504
Isn't that correct?

20:42.909 --> 20:46.344
Mmm... not quite like that.

20:46.346 --> 20:51.015
I mean,
I had to wait a few hours

20:51.017 --> 20:55.019
and when he came out,
I pulled into his driveway.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.555
Intending
to shoot him?

21:00.827 --> 21:03.294
Not necessarily.

21:03.296 --> 21:07.298
I thought maybe I could
scare him off or something

21:07.300 --> 21:08.833
you know?

21:08.835 --> 21:13.037
Threaten his old lady
if I could get her alone.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.042
What happened
to make you change your mind?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.983
I don't know.

21:25.985 --> 21:33.557
When he came out,
he was just... there.

21:34.861 --> 21:38.929
I kind of lost it.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.535
You said the gun
was not yours.

21:44.537 --> 21:47.538
No. It belongs to
the construction company.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.441
I've got an extra key
to the trailer.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.310
That's where the gun is now?

21:52.312 --> 21:54.011
Yeah.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.813
Bull's-eye.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.481
Where exactly is it kept?

21:57.483 --> 22:01.018
You want me to hand it over
on a silver platter?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.887
Good job.

22:02.889 --> 22:06.524
Make sure I get a copy
of that confession, Mikey.

22:06.526 --> 22:10.961
We need to be specific when
we're in front of the judge.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.897
You know the drill, Danny.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.033
It's in the toolbox,
right there with the tools

22:16.035 --> 22:19.070
and the rest of the stuff.

22:21.908 --> 22:26.644
Mike, looks like you got
this guy dead to rights.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.045
I guess so.

22:28.047 --> 22:31.515
You want to check it
before I hand it in?

22:31.517 --> 22:34.118
Just make sure all
the T's are crossed

22:34.120 --> 22:35.953
and the I's are dotted.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.054
I'm sure it's fine.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.056
It's all kosher?

22:39.058 --> 22:43.894
You want me to freaking
proofread it or what, Phil?

22:43.896 --> 22:47.898
It's just that in case
you had to drag it out of him

22:47.900 --> 22:51.969
we ought to know that before
his lawyer comes on board.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.477
He's saying
I dragged it out of him?

22:59.479 --> 23:03.047
He said something like that.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.516
You see any marks on the guy?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.952
It isn't that.

23:07.954 --> 23:11.655
It's that he said
you threatened to kill him.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.458
He said that, huh?

23:16.429 --> 23:18.696
A cop killer.

23:18.698 --> 23:23.634
You think I would
have killed him, Phil?

23:25.104 --> 23:27.104
I don't know, Mike.

23:27.106 --> 23:30.708
I don't know
what's in your mind.

23:30.710 --> 23:34.044
I don't know you well enough.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.448
That's right.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.583
You don't.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.521
"...maybe threaten
his old lady."

23:43.523 --> 23:46.657
Too bad
he didn't take that route.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.659
Marie would have
kicked his ass.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.994
That's for sure.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.996
Everything all right
with you two?

23:51.998 --> 23:54.665
Oh, yeah,
he's a good kid.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.101
The collar is
top of the line.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.669
Whoa, whoa, Phil.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.172
Let's stop with
the cliches already.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.541
What's going on?

24:05.478 --> 24:10.114
Suppose Logan went a little
over the line on this one.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.751
How far over?

24:13.753 --> 24:15.486
Not much--
maybe five yards.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.755
I wasn't even going
to mention this

24:17.757 --> 24:19.490
but apparently, or maybe

24:19.492 --> 24:22.593
he was going to blow
this guy's brains out.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.962
What the hell does that mean?

24:24.964 --> 24:29.967
Magadan says that Logan
was waving his gun at him.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.037
Mike's got to be thinking
this guy is armed.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.973
This is the guy
who killed his partner.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.642
Yeah, and he
would have his gun out.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.978
It was dark...

24:42.748 --> 24:45.649
And you got to be careful.

24:51.257 --> 24:55.526
I mean,
what are you going to do?

25:14.213 --> 25:16.213
Mike?

25:16.215 --> 25:19.817
Anything
you want to tell me?

25:19.819 --> 25:22.820
Yeah.

25:22.822 --> 25:26.023
I got us Max's killer.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.094
Okay, let's get a warrant.

25:30.096 --> 25:34.098
Get that freaking gun in here
before something happens to it.

25:34.100 --> 25:38.836
CERRETA:
<i> to search these premises.ant</i>

25:40.773 --> 25:42.673
All right.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.914
The officer's use of his gun
to get a confession...

26:23.916 --> 26:27.618
These allegations of threats
are not relevant to bail.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.321
Hold it-- if you believe
your client's statement

26:30.323 --> 26:32.723
was coerced, make a motion
to suppress it.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.758
People's case
appears to be tight.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.060
Confession was made

26:36.062 --> 26:37.595
inside the precinct.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.063
The weapon
was recovered.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.331
Corroborative evidence.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.099
Bail's out of the question.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.735
Legal aid
only represents Mr. Magadan

26:44.737 --> 26:47.672
for<i> this</i> arraignment.

26:47.673 --> 26:50.608
I'm sure his regular attorney
will challenge a confession

26:50.610 --> 26:52.710
obtained at the point of a gun.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.778
To which
the people will respond.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.082
Pursuant to criminal
procedure law section 510.40

26:58.084 --> 27:02.086
the defendant is remanded
to the custody of the state.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.926
Paul...

27:08.928 --> 27:11.662
If this is
the rubber hose routine...

27:11.664 --> 27:13.931
Yeah, well,
this was no rubber hose.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.933
This was
a .38 police special.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.368
And you're buying?

27:17.370 --> 27:19.670
Hey, I got nothing
invested here.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.939
Once his high-priced
mouthpiece rolls in

27:21.941 --> 27:23.674
my office is gone.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.810
I'm telling you,
it feels on the level

27:26.812 --> 27:28.379
and if it is

27:28.381 --> 27:30.748
it's a big pile
you've stepped in.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.788
From out of nowhere,
this detective rousts me.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.890
I'm trying to be cool

27:39.892 --> 27:43.661
but I figure the guy's on speed
or something.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.396
Why do you think that?

27:45.398 --> 27:50.801
Because before I'm halfway
into my act

27:50.803 --> 27:54.738
he puts his piece here.

27:54.740 --> 27:59.710
He asked me,
did I kill the fat cop.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.880
I don't say anything.

28:02.882 --> 28:06.083
I hear the hammer go back.

28:06.085 --> 28:11.021
Click... click.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.723
No bruises or cuts.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.692
No way to verify it.

28:14.694 --> 28:18.696
You just
spilled your guts.

28:18.698 --> 28:22.132
You know how to read
a rap sheet, don't you?

28:22.134 --> 28:25.869
Five arrests,
three convictions.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.772
So you're a loser. So?

28:28.774 --> 28:32.209
So, no guilty pleas.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.744
Two years ago

28:33.746 --> 28:36.780
I got popped
in Jersey.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.783
A missing semi-trailer
full of microwaves.

28:39.785 --> 28:45.456
A sergeant questions me
with a cigar.

28:45.458 --> 28:48.759
I didn't talk then either.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.129
But this, uh...

28:52.131 --> 28:55.466
and that sound...

28:55.468 --> 28:58.235
click.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.274
The guy was brought in.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.777
Sergeant Cerreta
mirandized him.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.011
He duly confessed.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.280
That doesn't undo the damage.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.281
What damage?

29:11.283 --> 29:12.282
You were there.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.851
You see anything screwy?

29:13.853 --> 29:15.853
Not in the interrogation room.

29:15.855 --> 29:19.089
We're talking about the alley,
right?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.824
What's the difference?

29:20.826 --> 29:21.992
I get the feeling

29:21.994 --> 29:23.994
we're not getting

29:23.996 --> 29:25.796
the whole truth.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.466
Well, Mike?

29:29.468 --> 29:30.467
Well, what?

29:30.469 --> 29:32.136
I asked the guy
about Max.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.804
He blurted it out.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.139
And did you help him?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.307
Did you?

29:37.309 --> 29:39.910
What I am asking, detective

29:39.912 --> 29:41.879
is did you threaten
Mr. Magadan

29:41.881 --> 29:44.081
in order to obtain
information?

29:44.083 --> 29:46.216
I pressured him, okay?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.785
Mike...

29:47.787 --> 29:49.787
I should sit on my ass

29:49.789 --> 29:51.121
while my partner's killer

29:51.123 --> 29:52.956
walks around free?

29:52.958 --> 29:55.159
That is exactly
what will happen

29:55.161 --> 29:57.995
because if the first
confession is coerced

29:57.997 --> 30:00.798
then so is the second
and the third

30:00.800 --> 30:03.801
no matter how many times
you mirandize.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.469
Coercion is a judgment call.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.136
My guy never laid a glove
on the son of a bitch.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.806
That doesn't matter.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.808
If he coerced
the first confession

30:10.810 --> 30:13.343
it is still fruit
of the poisonous tree.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.979
What's this--
some stupid technicality?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.081
Explain the concept to your man

30:18.083 --> 30:21.351
so they don't let
another cop killer walk.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.557
I doubt if Max Greevey

30:26.559 --> 30:29.293
would have considered it
a technicality.

30:31.897 --> 30:34.565
So Stone's
holding you responsible

30:34.567 --> 30:36.867
for Magadan
possibly getting off.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.969
Do you think that's fair?

30:38.971 --> 30:40.103
No, I don't

30:40.105 --> 30:43.907
but I don't give a damn
what he thinks.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.976
That's not what I asked you.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.377
It's not?

30:47.379 --> 30:49.313
What I'm asking is

30:49.315 --> 30:52.382
do you feel
it's a fair assessment?

30:52.384 --> 30:56.587
Do I feel responsible
for Max getting blown away?

30:56.589 --> 30:59.990
Maybe if I'd gone home
with him, you know...

30:59.992 --> 31:03.160
maybe he wouldn't
have gotten zipped.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.263
Maybe I just should have

31:06.265 --> 31:11.101
stepped in front
of that bullet myself, right?

31:21.247 --> 31:25.249
No, I don't feel responsible.

31:25.251 --> 31:29.353
I feel incredibly...

31:29.355 --> 31:32.055
angry.

31:35.995 --> 31:39.129
That one of your seven stages?

31:43.369 --> 31:46.370
Great.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.273
This is a statement
which Detective Logan

31:49.275 --> 31:51.675
gave voluntarily
to the investigators

31:51.677 --> 31:54.044
of the internal affairs
division.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.914
Please read it over
and advise your client.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.216
Where are we going
to assign him

31:59.218 --> 32:00.684
till this is resolved?

32:00.686 --> 32:02.052
Temp desk.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.388
Plus, he's got
vacation time coming.

32:04.390 --> 32:07.357
You don't expect the lad
to sign this now?

32:07.359 --> 32:10.460
He and I have some conferring
to do.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.463
Am I the stiff
at my own funeral?

32:13.465 --> 32:15.032
"He looks so lifelike..."

32:15.034 --> 32:17.034
Come on,
cool it, Mike.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.035
Everybody's acting like
<i> I'm</i> the one that's dead.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.039
"Menacing."

32:22.041 --> 32:24.942
You're charging me
with a class "B" misdemeanor.

32:24.944 --> 32:28.178
We are not charging you
with anything<i> yet</i>

32:28.180 --> 32:30.347
but I suggest you talk
to your captain

32:30.349 --> 32:33.417
about the odds of losing
your pension<i> and</i> your badge

32:33.419 --> 32:36.420
and the possibility
of a lawsuit against you

32:36.422 --> 32:39.022
for violating
Mr. Magadan's civil rights.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.458
<i> His</i> civil rights?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.493
What about Max's civil rights?

32:43.495 --> 32:44.995
This is not a case

32:44.997 --> 32:47.497
of ends justifying the means.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.968
Of course it is,
and you know it.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.971
You do the exact
same thing every day.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.073
You threaten to send them away

32:56.075 --> 32:58.108
or whisper
their dirty little secrets.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.277
You threaten
to screw up their lives

33:00.279 --> 33:03.480
just to get a little information
from them.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.716
I didn't do it at gunpoint,
Detective.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.384
There's a big difference.

33:09.054 --> 33:12.723
Mike, as your P.B.A. attorney,
I must advise you

33:12.725 --> 33:14.358
not to sign anything...

33:14.360 --> 33:15.759
Why not?

33:18.130 --> 33:20.731
It's the truth.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.109
Just lucky
that this isn't L.A.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.478
Everybody walks around
with a video camera.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.113
What's the point?

33:36.115 --> 33:38.382
He never physically
injured the guy.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.484
The best we can do
is menacing.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.052
For blowing our case!

33:42.054 --> 33:44.254
I'd bust him
for reckless endangerment

33:44.256 --> 33:45.422
if I could.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.557
His partner
was killed, Adam.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.192
No jury would convict.

33:49.194 --> 33:52.029
Any chance of arguing

33:52.031 --> 33:53.730
the confession wasn't coerced?

33:53.732 --> 33:55.966
With a gun to his head?

33:55.967 --> 33:58.201
The man is a suspect
in a cop killing.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.537
If Logan saw a gun, then...

34:00.539 --> 34:02.356
There was no gun.

34:02.357 --> 34:04.174
Every piece of evidence,
every statement

34:04.176 --> 34:06.810
is tainted by Logan's
reckless action.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.245
It's all useless.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.283
A guy kills a cop.

34:13.285 --> 34:16.219
We catch him,
and we can't close.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.355
Hell of a system.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.092
Talk to Logan.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.161
Maybe magadan
said something

34:24.163 --> 34:30.200
before he pulled
his little stunt with the .38.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.768
I took him
by surprise.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.204
It hasn't changed
since yesterday.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.440
Hey, we're on the same side.

34:41.213 --> 34:44.314
What about
the initial investigation?

34:44.316 --> 34:47.184
Can we get him
on anything else?

34:47.186 --> 34:50.153
Magadan's name never came up.

34:50.155 --> 34:53.590
Look, we got the owner
of the company on the ropes.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.126
Anything we can use there?

34:56.128 --> 34:59.329
Morgan Stern was a heavy
in the copper scam

34:59.331 --> 35:02.199
but we weren't able
to get to him.

35:02.201 --> 35:06.303
We were waiting for Judge Merlis
to sign search warrant apps

35:06.305 --> 35:09.339
for half a dozen
construction sites.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.541
Are they still unsigned?

35:11.543 --> 35:14.878
Due out
the day after Max went down.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.882
You may be a hero after all.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.350
Yeah.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.152
Right.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.458
No, we're arguing
inevitability.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.694
The unsigned search warrants
are very apropos

35:30.696 --> 35:32.629
to the grand jury
investigation.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.498
And had they been signed

35:34.500 --> 35:36.533
Cerreta and Logan

35:36.534 --> 35:38.567
could have used
the task force warrants

35:38.570 --> 35:39.870
to confiscate the gun?

35:39.872 --> 35:41.471
Making search warrants

35:41.473 --> 35:43.473
from the coerced confession
unnecessary.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.575
We would have found the gun.

35:45.577 --> 35:49.446
Oh, that's going to take
a lot of fast talking.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.548
We get the calendar
against us

35:51.550 --> 35:53.683
we draw the wrong judge

35:53.685 --> 35:56.453
we're in too deep
to tread water.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.889
Then it's sink or swim.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.526
We got a choice?

36:02.528 --> 36:04.528
No.

36:09.635 --> 36:12.502
The gun is the fruit
of the coerced confession.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.870
It must be excluded.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.605
Tainted evidence
is admissable

36:15.607 --> 36:18.408
if it would inevitably
have been found

36:18.410 --> 36:19.709
by other police
techniques.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.545
The fourth amendment
is obsolete?

36:21.547 --> 36:24.347
It is the exception
to the exclusionary rule.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.650
The task force applied
for a search warrant

36:26.652 --> 36:28.785
during the grand jury
investigation

36:28.787 --> 36:31.521
and before Detective Greevey
was murdered.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.789
It was never signed.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.457
It would have been.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.592
It's very specific.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.694
It covers cash, documents
and weapons.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.663
We would have found that gun.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.032
Your Honor,
he's bootstrapping.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.400
His evidence was poisoned
by the coerced confession.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.869
He's begging for another way.

36:45.871 --> 36:49.706
Supreme court stance
on the scope of warrants

36:49.708 --> 36:52.475
is much looser
than it's ever been

36:52.477 --> 36:55.579
given the recent
Fulminante decision.

36:55.581 --> 37:00.417
I'm going to have to allow
the gun into evidence.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.418
Your Honor..!

37:01.420 --> 37:04.004
But...

37:04.005 --> 37:06.589
any reference, whatsoever,
to Mr. Magadan's confession

37:06.592 --> 37:08.391
and I declare a mistrial

37:08.393 --> 37:11.828
before Mr. Lambrusco here
even thinks about objecting.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.763
Understood?

37:13.765 --> 37:16.499
We found out the gun
was in a trailer

37:16.501 --> 37:19.436
at a construction site
on West 51st Street.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.838
Did you obtain
a warrant for the site?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.906
Yes, we did.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.574
When we arrived

37:24.576 --> 37:27.344
we discovered the gun
at the specified trailer.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.446
STONE:
To whom was
the gun registered?

37:29.448 --> 37:32.682
Morgan Stern,
the defendant's employer.

37:32.684 --> 37:36.853
The permit limits use of the gun
to the construction site only.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.556
For purposes of security,
I presume?

37:39.558 --> 37:40.991
I would guess.

37:40.993 --> 37:42.926
Thank you.
No more questions.

37:44.596 --> 37:49.499
Let's stay with this
famous gun, detective.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.700
Now you testified

37:50.702 --> 37:53.003
that you didn't find it
on Mr. Magadan

37:53.005 --> 37:54.804
when you arrested him.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.608
That's correct.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.410
Did you recover any weapons

38:00.412 --> 38:02.479
from Mr. Magadan's
person?

38:02.481 --> 38:05.566
No. He was unarmed.

38:05.567 --> 38:08.652
When you first confronted
Mr. Magadan in that alley

38:08.654 --> 38:12.789
did you consider him
to be a witness or a suspect?

38:18.563 --> 38:21.765
He wasn't immediately arrested.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.701
And yet you placed him
under arrest

38:24.703 --> 38:27.671
just a few moments later,
did you not?

38:27.673 --> 38:30.707
Yes, I did.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.817
(<i> sighs</i> )

38:40.819 --> 38:43.653
I was at the site
checking some invoices.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.788
Danny showed up.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.823
He was surprised
to see me.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.025
Did he have the gun
when he arrived?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.660
It was dark.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.662
He seemed to be
hiding something.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.664
Could you describe
what that was?

38:54.666 --> 38:57.467
It was pretty obvious
it was a gun.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.736
Did Mr. Magadan
say anything?

38:59.738 --> 39:03.707
He was all sweaty,
kind of whacked out.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.842
I asked what was up.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.445
He was terrified
that the grand jury

39:08.447 --> 39:10.780
would look into
Inspector Janklow's death.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.549
Objection! Hearsay.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.050
Statement against
penal interest, Your Honor.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.852
Overruled.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.821
What else did he say?

39:17.823 --> 39:21.691
He took care of our problem
with the grand jury.

39:21.693 --> 39:22.726
Objection.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.261
Your Honor, hearsay.

39:24.262 --> 39:25.795
Overruled--
same reason as before.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.731
Your witness.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.701
You never saw Mr. Magadan
with a weapon that evening.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.903
No. I said I thought
it was obvious.

39:33.905 --> 39:38.074
Isn't it true that<i> you</i>
were among the targets

39:38.076 --> 39:39.976
of that secret
grand jury?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.678
I have no idea.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.079
Didn't you make a deal

39:43.081 --> 39:45.882
for immunity
against those indictments

39:45.884 --> 39:48.585
if you testified
against Mr. Magadan?

39:48.587 --> 39:51.121
Yeah. Yes.

39:51.123 --> 39:54.657
So before this arrangement
with the district attorney

39:54.659 --> 39:57.594
you had just as much motive
as Mr. Magadan

39:57.596 --> 40:00.029
to keep Detective Greevey
from testifying.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.499
I'm not crazy enough
to kill a cop.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.666
It was your gun.

40:03.668 --> 40:04.601
You had access.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.736
You certainly
had opportunity.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.871
By your own testimony

40:07.873 --> 40:10.673
Mr. Magadan said
that he had taken care

40:10.675 --> 40:13.743
of<i> your</i> problem
with the grand jury, correct?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.111
I didn't kill that guy.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.680
Everybody knows
that Danny copped to it

40:17.682 --> 40:19.015
when the cop's
partner

40:19.017 --> 40:20.950
put a gun in his ear.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.586
I move
for an immediate mistrial.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.955
Your Honor, may we recess?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.924
Court is in recess.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.562
What's going on here?

40:32.564 --> 40:34.764
His question elicited
the confession reference.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.533
And your damn witness.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.002
Are you suggesting
he was coached to let it slip?

40:39.004 --> 40:40.770
What's the difference?

40:40.772 --> 40:42.071
Drop the histrionics.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.706
Just give me the law

40:43.708 --> 40:45.842
and make it brief,
gentlemen.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.679
(<i> sighs</i> )

40:49.681 --> 40:51.948
What the Supreme Court
said recently

40:51.950 --> 40:54.784
in theFulminantecase
is to the point.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.886
Yes, the confession is coerced.

40:56.888 --> 40:59.722
Yes, the jury
heard about it.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.858
No, we needn't throw
the case out.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.726
We fall back to the dark ages

41:03.728 --> 41:05.895
because
of theFulminantedecision?

41:05.897 --> 41:07.764
You suggest
we find some guy

41:07.766 --> 41:09.799
with body parts
in his freezer

41:09.801 --> 41:12.702
and let him walk
because some cop

41:12.704 --> 41:13.803
got too rough with him?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.805
That is hardly pertinent, Ben.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.175
The Supreme Court's decision
is based on the belief

41:19.177 --> 41:23.613
that the jury can be instructed
to disregard certain remarks.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.149
You warned him, judge.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.684
"One mention of the confession,
and I'll throw the case out."

41:28.687 --> 41:30.119
That was to both of us.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.857
I know what I said, gentlemen

41:33.859 --> 41:36.826
and I'm familiar with the law.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.695
That's enough
for today.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.030
I'll have a decision
tomorrow morning.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.101
JUDGE:
<i> counselor.my ruling,</i>

41:45.103 --> 41:47.103
You're guaranteeing
a conviction.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.638
Why bother..?

41:48.640 --> 41:49.706
Why bother

41:49.708 --> 41:51.908
following the guidelines

41:51.909 --> 41:54.109
of the supreme court
of the United States?

41:54.112 --> 41:55.845
Those guidelines violate

41:55.847 --> 41:59.082
my client's right
against self-incrimination.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.684
Last year's automatic mistrial

42:01.686 --> 42:03.786
is this year's harmless error.

42:03.788 --> 42:07.090
The Supreme Court has spoken,
Mr. Lambrusco.

42:07.092 --> 42:10.093
Now it's the law
of the land.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.262
Bottom line, counselor.

42:12.264 --> 42:16.733
In addition to whatever else
the prosecution can prove

42:16.735 --> 42:20.737
your client is guilty
of bad timing.

42:20.739 --> 42:23.873
Defense motion for a mistrial
is denied.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.742
Thank you, Your Honor.

42:25.744 --> 42:29.946
Give me ten minutes, please,
then bring in the jury.

42:29.948 --> 42:33.650
STONE:
The world in which
Daniel Magadan, Jr. lives

42:33.652 --> 42:35.752
has a very simple set of rules.

42:35.754 --> 42:40.023
You buy three truckloads
of cement, you pay for two.

42:40.025 --> 42:42.825
An honest building inspector

42:42.827 --> 42:47.697
discovers your pattern
of extortion and illegal payoffs

42:47.699 --> 42:51.901
you toss him 60 stories
onto 48th Street.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.771
A police officer testifies
against you

42:54.773 --> 42:57.173
you put three bullets in him.

42:57.175 --> 43:00.777
The law has a set of rules too.

43:00.779 --> 43:05.048
Not simple,
but ultimately unequivocal.

43:05.050 --> 43:09.052
You kill a cop, you go to jail.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.955
You don't get out.

43:13.058 --> 43:14.824
BAILIFF:
All rise.

43:14.826 --> 43:18.861
Court of judge manuel leon
is now in session.

43:19.965 --> 43:22.231
Be seated.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.036
Technically, Mr. Magadan

43:27.038 --> 43:30.807
you've been found guilty
of murder in the first degree

43:30.809 --> 43:31.908
which is reserved

43:31.910 --> 43:34.777
for the killing
of a police officer

43:34.779 --> 43:37.030
in the line of duty.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.282
The death penalty having
been held unconstitutional

43:39.284 --> 43:41.751
by our court of appeals
in Albany

43:41.753 --> 43:44.287
renders me powerless
to sentence you

43:44.289 --> 43:47.724
to the punishment
you so richly deserve.

43:47.726 --> 43:50.360
The court, therefore,
sentences you

43:50.362 --> 43:55.798
to a term of 25 years
to life imprisonment.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.302
The people have recommended
the severest limitation

43:59.304 --> 44:02.138
for any possibility of parole

44:02.140 --> 44:06.843
and I see no reason to disagree.

44:11.916 --> 44:14.917
Maybe life wasn't enough
of a sentence.

44:16.254 --> 44:19.122
That's what the law allows.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.057
I can live with it.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.363
I know I went over the line.

44:27.365 --> 44:30.366
I was down on myself
for a while.

44:30.368 --> 44:35.038
Even though I, you know,
try to rationalize it.

44:40.278 --> 44:45.281
I have to find a way
to forgive myself.

44:45.283 --> 44:48.284
Acceptance, Logan.

44:48.286 --> 44:49.352
That's the...

44:49.354 --> 44:50.853
Yeah.

44:50.855 --> 44:54.857
That's the last stage, right?

45:02.167 --> 45:05.301
Max's death...

45:05.303 --> 45:07.303
I accept it

45:07.305 --> 45:10.306
but I'll never accept it.

45:10.308 --> 45:13.242
You know?
