00:28.910 --> 00:32.229
I can't wait
for Christmas, you guys.

00:32.229 --> 00:36.110
Look at all the presents that
are already under our tree.

00:36.110 --> 00:38.810
- Ours has still got to
be the very first tree

00:38.810 --> 00:40.280
of the holiday season.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.760
- Right.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.580
I mean, who in the whole wide world

00:46.164 --> 00:48.863
could possibly get a jump
on Christmas like we do?

00:50.490 --> 00:53.570
- Santa's own faithful reindeer squad.

00:53.570 --> 00:56.860
Tinker, Terry, Perry, and Larry.

00:56.860 --> 00:59.050
- Putting smiles on faces and brightening

00:59.050 --> 01:01.163
even the snowiest nights for,

01:02.240 --> 01:04.670
how long have we been
doing this gig for now?

01:04.670 --> 01:06.423
- A long time.

01:07.620 --> 01:11.060
- That's right, a real long time.

01:11.060 --> 01:14.410
And every Christmas
morning, it still feels

01:14.410 --> 01:17.960
like my first ride in the sleigh.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.934
- That's the magic of Christmas, Terry.

01:20.934 --> 01:21.767
- Huh.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.370
Hocus pocus is more like it.

01:23.370 --> 01:25.750
- Hey, what's up with you, Larry?

01:25.750 --> 01:29.840
- Yeah, you got a humbug in
your bonnet or something?

01:34.687 --> 01:36.060
- I don't wear a bonnet, Tinker.

01:36.060 --> 01:39.360
I wear a harness, and one of
those dumb red and white hats

01:39.360 --> 01:40.610
with the snowball on top.

01:40.610 --> 01:43.100
- Hey, Santa's hat isn't dumb.

01:43.100 --> 01:43.933
- Yeah!

01:44.910 --> 01:47.640
Nothing about Christmas is dumb.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.253
What's gotten into you, Lar?

01:50.100 --> 01:52.007
- Or should we say Scrooge McDeer?

01:55.890 --> 01:58.060
- What if every sleigh
ride doesn't feel like

01:58.060 --> 01:59.880
the first sleigh ride to some of us?

01:59.880 --> 02:02.820
Every year, it's the same old same old.

02:02.820 --> 02:05.400
Fly through the night
in subzero temperatures,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.680
land on slippery rooftop
after slippery rooftop,

02:08.680 --> 02:11.660
watch Santa squeeze down another chimney,

02:11.660 --> 02:13.660
or get the key from under the doormat,

02:13.660 --> 02:16.050
since lots of these new homes
don't even have chimneys,

02:16.050 --> 02:19.210
we will then hang around
trying not to be spotted

02:19.210 --> 02:24.180
while he takes his good old
time arranging gifts just right.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.690
I mean come on, aren't you guys bored?

02:26.690 --> 02:27.980
- No!

02:27.980 --> 02:30.200
- It looks like you're overruled, Larry.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.020
The rest of us still
love the holiday season!

02:34.020 --> 02:35.142
- Yeah!

02:35.142 --> 02:36.730
And I love it too!

02:36.730 --> 02:38.760
That's how come I care so much.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.280
I don't wanna see Christmas
get boring for anybody,

02:41.280 --> 02:43.623
young or old, ever!

02:43.623 --> 02:45.210
- Then look alive.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.590
We still have decorations to hang.

02:47.590 --> 02:51.510
And new presents are popping
up under our tree every day.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.953
- The countdown's on, Larry.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.566
- Soon it will be Christmas Day.

02:59.330 --> 03:02.360
- Some more creative
control would be nice.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.940
After all, who knows
Christmas better than we do?

03:05.940 --> 03:07.780
- Santa, that's who.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.070
And until he wants to change things up,

03:10.070 --> 03:13.830
we're going to celebrate Christmas
just like we always have.

03:13.830 --> 03:16.720
- Yeah, with smiles and
laughter and high flying.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.030
Ho ho holing high jeans

03:19.030 --> 03:21.670
- Christmas is boring you guys.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.223
Just booooooring.

03:26.313 --> 03:29.320
- Santa, I can't wait for Christmas eve.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.756
All my elf life I've been on a shelf

03:31.756 --> 03:33.490
dreaming of the day when I've been asked

03:33.490 --> 03:35.702
to join your sleighing.

03:35.702 --> 03:36.850
And here it is.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.743
It's greater than I ever imagined.

03:39.743 --> 03:43.990
- Ho ho ho Benny, I'm glad you're enjoying

03:43.990 --> 03:48.053
your first Christmas as a full
pledged member of our team.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.040
- Boy am I!

03:51.040 --> 03:53.820
- As you know, making
sure Christmas happens

03:53.820 --> 03:56.700
for everyone is a lot of hard work.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.370
- I can see that.

03:58.370 --> 04:02.190
I had no idea about
everything that goes into it.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.610
All the little details, the pre-planning,

04:04.610 --> 04:05.890
the fool-proofing.

04:05.890 --> 04:07.843
Christmas is just perfect.

04:08.910 --> 04:12.550
- Christmas has been perfect
for years and years Benny.

04:12.550 --> 04:15.880
As long as folks are smiling
on Christmas morning,

04:15.880 --> 04:17.790
our job is done.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.680
And joy never goes out of style.

04:20.680 --> 04:24.430
Congratulations and welcome
to La Chim my little elf.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.380
I'm happy to have you.

04:26.380 --> 04:30.170
Now, if you don't mind, we
have just a few more presents

04:30.170 --> 04:33.786
to wrap this evening before
you whisk off the bed.

04:33.786 --> 04:37.113
- Oh, I would wrap a thousand more Santa.

04:38.019 --> 04:39.681
A million even.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:17.109 --> 05:19.220
- I despise this time of the year Clank,

05:19.220 --> 05:23.040
there has joy and the
despicable good will.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.010
It affects the land every year.

05:25.010 --> 05:27.610
Year after year after year.

05:27.610 --> 05:28.443
Blah!

05:29.575 --> 05:31.770
- I agree master.

05:31.770 --> 05:35.790
It's a good thing we
don't have to celebrate.

05:35.790 --> 05:40.790
Up here in the land of no,
there's no Christmas here.

05:42.220 --> 05:46.060
- If only that were so
Clank, merely knowing

05:46.060 --> 05:48.990
that Christmas exist,
it make me want to crush

05:48.990 --> 05:52.260
their little party.

05:52.260 --> 05:54.580
This year I plan to do just that.

05:55.673 --> 05:57.840
- What do you mean master?

05:59.170 --> 06:03.990
- My magic foresight has
detected a pronounced weakness

06:03.990 --> 06:07.140
in character at the North Pole.

06:07.140 --> 06:10.180
A weakness all glaring, I can exploit it

06:10.180 --> 06:11.253
for my own purposes.

06:12.148 --> 06:14.070
- Is it Santa?

06:14.070 --> 06:17.960
Is he finally growing tired of his role

06:17.960 --> 06:20.540
as the whole planet's gift giver?

06:20.540 --> 06:23.280
- Nah, Santa, he's a lost cause.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.730
He'll give gifts till the end of time.

06:25.730 --> 06:28.150
He loves his holiday to learn everywhere.

06:28.150 --> 06:31.530
Hard to must to ever betray his mission.

06:31.530 --> 06:35.710
The one that my sixth sense is feeling

06:35.710 --> 06:37.743
is another creature.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.193
A goofy one.

06:42.150 --> 06:46.640
One of the thankless workers
who's grown dissatisfied

06:46.640 --> 06:50.290
and discontent and dismayed even.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.313
With his place at the North Pole.

06:54.930 --> 06:57.973
- Bah, humbug, no more
gifts under the tree.

06:59.305 --> 07:00.583
Boring!

07:03.360 --> 07:05.943
- I can work with this type of gloom.

07:07.830 --> 07:09.617
- So rigorous master.

07:11.707 --> 07:16.707
How do you propose we use
this gloom to our advantage?

07:18.560 --> 07:20.563
- I tell you how.

07:20.563 --> 07:25.140
This creature is so
foolish and so pompous.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.780
If we were to put him
in charge of Christmas,

07:27.780 --> 07:30.840
he will ruin the holidays all on his own

07:30.840 --> 07:35.544
without us having to ever lift a finger.

07:35.544 --> 07:40.544
- Sounds downright desperately master.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.643
- That it is Clank.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.090
Dare I say, this will be the year

07:47.090 --> 07:50.320
the fun of Christmas ends.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.860
And for this year,
neighsayers around the world

07:53.860 --> 07:57.410
will forget the name of
screwed and and dread,

07:57.410 --> 08:02.410
an all new holiday villain
who ruined Christmas forever.

08:03.718 --> 08:05.363
The Mighty Bunion.

08:23.902 --> 08:26.370
- Wonderful job tonight, Benny.

08:26.370 --> 08:30.440
I'm very much looking forward
to the sleigh ride with you.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.043
It's a joy having you on my team.

08:33.957 --> 08:35.360
- I'm honored Santa.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.169
There's no place else I'd rather be.

08:38.169 --> 08:41.590
- That's the attitude my
elf, I predict we're going

08:41.590 --> 08:43.820
to do great things together.

08:43.820 --> 08:48.010
Now, if you'll excuse
me, it's time for bed.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.100
I'm not as young as I used to be

08:50.100 --> 08:54.480
and a good night's sleep is
getting more and more important

08:54.480 --> 08:56.620
as the years go by.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.770
- I understand Santa.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.643
I'll make sure the stove
burners are turned off

08:59.643 --> 09:01.880
and the candles are blown out.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.920
- Thank you Benny for all that you do.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.080
- Good night Santa.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.040
I'll start breakfast at sun up

09:09.040 --> 09:10.800
and see you bright and early.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.400
We can wrap more presents if you like.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.663
- You know it, my elf.

09:15.530 --> 09:18.760
Here at the North Pole,
there will always be

09:18.760 --> 09:21.803
more presents to wrap.

09:23.733 --> 09:26.010
- Good work today, everyone.

09:26.010 --> 09:29.310
I'm looking forward to even more tomorrow.

09:29.310 --> 09:30.160
- Who am I?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.250
The lead up to Christmas is
more fun than anything else

09:32.250 --> 09:33.380
I can think of.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.676
- Except Christmas itself.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.820
Na-na-nothing beats that.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.770
- You've got that right, Terry.

09:40.770 --> 09:45.000
Each year around this time,
I think the same thing.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.070
How lucky we are to be Christmas reindeer

09:48.070 --> 09:49.800
at the North Pole.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.633
- Yeah!

09:51.940 --> 09:53.390
- Buh, humbug.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.260
- Excuse me, Larry?

09:55.260 --> 09:56.510
I didn't hear you.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.144
Could you speak up?

09:58.144 --> 09:58.977
- Huh?

09:58.977 --> 10:00.273
Oh, nothing.

10:00.273 --> 10:02.390
I was just clearing my throat.

10:02.390 --> 10:04.370
- Aw, okay.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.460
Well, sleep tight gang.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.850
I'll see you bright and
early in the morning.

10:08.850 --> 10:12.022
And we can pick up where we left off.

10:12.022 --> 10:14.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.690
- You mean what you're
telling us over and over

10:16.690 --> 10:19.150
how great everything
is and how lucky we are

10:19.150 --> 10:21.900
to do the same things year
after year after year?

10:21.900 --> 10:23.903
Gee, I can't wait.

10:23.903 --> 10:28.020
- Hey, that's not the holiday spirit, Lar.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.170
- Yeah, it's Christmas time.

10:30.170 --> 10:31.560
- Huh, humbug.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.650
You guys celebrate all you want.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.891
I'm gonna take a stroll in the town.

10:35.891 --> 10:37.410
- You want us to come with you?

10:37.410 --> 10:39.930
- Nah, I'm my own reindeer.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.780
I don't always need to be part
of a deer quartet, you know.

10:43.780 --> 10:46.125
- Oh, well suit yourself then.

10:46.125 --> 10:47.292
Trabby McCrab.

10:51.697 --> 10:55.340
- Sometimes I wonder if this
life is the best there is.

10:55.340 --> 10:58.683
Now, if I could just
be in charge of things.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.640
It would really be a
Christmas to remember.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.923
Maybe you can be in charge Larry.

11:06.837 --> 11:07.910
- What?

11:07.910 --> 11:08.743
Who said that?

11:08.743 --> 11:09.576
Who's there?

11:09.576 --> 11:10.409
Just a friend.

11:11.342 --> 11:13.620
And your best friend.

11:13.620 --> 11:17.582
Perhaps your only friend.

11:17.582 --> 11:21.670
All the others don't
understand you like I do Larry.

11:21.670 --> 11:22.503
- Who?

11:23.360 --> 11:25.112
Who are you?

11:25.112 --> 11:26.470
Come with me.

11:26.470 --> 11:30.193
My friends call me, call me B.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.460
- Okay, B.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.520
How is it that I can hear
you but I can't see you?

11:37.520 --> 11:41.520
We are communicating
telepathically Larry.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.010
Our minds are connected.

11:44.010 --> 11:49.010
We don't need words to know
what one another is thinking.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.240
- Wow, cool.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.390
Isn't it, though?

11:53.260 --> 11:56.400
We can do lots of cool things, Larry.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.060
Things you'll never dreamt of.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.860
Or perhaps you have.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.330
- What kind of things, B?

12:05.330 --> 12:07.870
- Oh, fun things.

12:07.870 --> 12:11.550
Like taking control of Christmas

12:11.550 --> 12:14.693
and making new rules.

12:15.650 --> 12:18.170
Changing the way things are done.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.580
There are the North Pole.

12:20.580 --> 12:25.260
Doing things differently
or differs time ever.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.840
- Wow, is that even possible?

12:27.840 --> 12:31.610
- With the two of us
working together Larry,

12:31.610 --> 12:36.610
working in tandem, anything is possible.

12:36.765 --> 12:39.265
Anything you put your mind to.

12:40.172 --> 12:41.382
- Anything?

12:41.382 --> 12:42.299
- Anything.

12:43.697 --> 12:47.230
You are the future of Christmas Larry.

12:47.230 --> 12:52.230
And all that is required
for you to seize your chance

12:52.620 --> 12:55.069
is to take the final step.

12:55.069 --> 12:56.070
- What step?

12:56.070 --> 12:57.350
Where does it go?

12:57.350 --> 13:00.440
- Here, to my castle.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.620
Not far.

13:02.620 --> 13:06.050
All you have to do is find me Larry.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.070
- Really?

13:07.070 --> 13:09.003
Okay, how do I get there?

13:10.140 --> 13:15.140
- Just follow my directions
old majestic reindeer.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.270
You'll leave first thing in the morning

13:18.270 --> 13:21.230
and be here before you know it.

13:21.230 --> 13:24.293
- Wow, I'll await your directions, B.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.773
Over and out deer.

13:35.470 --> 13:37.650
- Joy, oh Joy!

13:37.650 --> 13:40.573
Finally, it will be a
Christmas to remember.

13:41.873 --> 13:44.887
- Here I'm right where you wanted master.

13:46.698 --> 13:50.230
- This Christmas reindeer
are a simple sort.

13:50.230 --> 13:55.230
He'll soon be eating hay
right outta my hand.

13:59.570 --> 14:01.660
What's gotten
into Larry, you guys?

14:01.660 --> 14:03.010
- Never seen him like that.

14:05.584 --> 14:09.060
- The hard work has
probably gotten to him.

14:09.060 --> 14:13.320
He'll be better right after
our Christmas delivery.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.900
- Yeah, nothing a few mugs of hot coco

14:16.900 --> 14:18.830
and marshmallows can't cure.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.650
- Hear, hear.

14:20.650 --> 14:23.771
- Now, let's sit the hay guys.

14:23.771 --> 14:25.457
I'm beat.

14:25.457 --> 14:27.720
- All right, don't forget.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.880
Meeting with Santa first thing AM.

14:30.880 --> 14:31.713
- Check that.

14:38.766 --> 14:40.260
- Top of the morning Larry.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.140
- Sowen, the Christmas cicada.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.640
- The Christmas bug Larry.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.920
I'm Sowen, the Christmas bug.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.470
I get folks during the
holidays and don't let them be

14:48.470 --> 14:49.900
until the presents are bought.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.700
- Yeah and the last
drop of eggnog is gone.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.340
- Yup, that's me.

14:54.340 --> 14:57.840
A bug some pesky Christmas bug.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.920
Where are you going?

14:58.920 --> 15:01.660
- I'm gonna train to
replace Santa this year.

15:01.660 --> 15:05.250
I'll take over Christmas
and make it the most amazing

15:05.250 --> 15:06.630
holiday in the world.

15:06.630 --> 15:08.221
- News flash, Larry.

15:08.221 --> 15:10.950
Christmas is the most
amazing holiday in the world.

15:10.950 --> 15:13.620
Or didn't you get the memo?

15:13.620 --> 15:14.960
- I can make it better.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.793
- Really?

15:15.793 --> 15:18.770
That's a grand statement Larry, prove it.

15:18.770 --> 15:19.970
- I'll prove it to you.

15:19.970 --> 15:22.103
Once I'm gonna Santa and Chief,

15:22.103 --> 15:25.660
I'll make you honorary Larry helper.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.870
- Larry the reindeer as the new Santa

15:27.870 --> 15:30.999
and Sowen the Christmas
bug as a Larry helper?

15:32.219 --> 15:33.140
That's something I have to see

15:33.140 --> 15:34.980
with my own little bug antenna.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.660
- I'm on the way to get
my Santa credentials.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.190
So, are you coming?

15:39.190 --> 15:40.960
- Not missing this for anything.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.010
You got yourself a traveling buddy Larry.

15:44.430 --> 15:47.870
What's Santa say about
you taking over Christmas?

15:47.870 --> 15:50.000
- Santa's gotta be so proud of me.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.330
- You think so?

15:51.330 --> 15:52.570
- How could he not?

15:52.570 --> 15:54.780
I'll make Christmas so amazing,

15:54.780 --> 15:56.970
his beard will fall off his jolly face.

15:56.970 --> 15:59.040
- That'll be another one for the books.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.720
- My mind assures that
the reindeer has left

16:02.720 --> 16:04.800
the North Pole, Clank.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.660
He'll be here soon
enough and plenty of time

16:09.660 --> 16:12.133
to ruin that blast the
Christmas for everyone.

16:14.516 --> 16:18.130
But I also see a companion by his side.

16:18.130 --> 16:19.933
- A companion?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.287
Who is it master?

16:23.680 --> 16:26.607
- He's some sort of insect.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.183
Flea, maybe.

16:31.412 --> 16:36.240
- You should trim your beard
before they get here master.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.200
- Nos es.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.023
I never trim this beard and
I'm not about to start now.

16:42.070 --> 16:42.903
- Tie it up?

16:43.740 --> 16:47.523
- No, I'll let it flow wild and free.

16:48.417 --> 16:50.273
It's part of my important magic.

16:51.750 --> 16:56.750
- What if that flea gets
tangled in your hair master?

16:56.810 --> 17:01.010
- Then I'll just crush it
just like I'm about to do

17:01.010 --> 17:05.517
to the world's most
beloved holiday.

17:06.382 --> 17:09.618
- Well, how about that master?

17:09.618 --> 17:14.560
I was thinking, I could
take the reindeer's place.

17:14.560 --> 17:19.367
I can return to the North
Pole and guide Santa's sleigh

17:19.367 --> 17:21.201
right into the ground.

17:22.390 --> 17:23.869
- No, Clank.

17:23.869 --> 17:28.319
We already tried that
with your brother, Clink.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.290
He deemed off for a nobody.

17:30.290 --> 17:32.510
We'll proceed as planned.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.690
No discussion.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.970
Set the dining room and a table.

17:35.970 --> 17:39.280
Prepare a plate of whiz or something.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.210
Or whatever those reindeer eat.

17:41.210 --> 17:44.300
I want him to feel right at home.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.850
- Yes, master.

17:46.850 --> 17:51.850
- The end of Christmas is approaching.

17:53.118 --> 17:57.730
- Good morning my wonderful,
hardworking reindeer.

17:57.730 --> 18:01.360
I so love seeing the twinkles
that light up your eyes

18:01.360 --> 18:03.030
this time of year.

18:03.030 --> 18:07.950
- The same way we love seeing
you get into Santa mode.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.670
Right Santa?

18:10.670 --> 18:13.530
- All part of the job Terry.

18:13.530 --> 18:14.363
But wait.

18:15.453 --> 18:19.197
One, two, three, someone's missing.

18:20.953 --> 18:23.863
- Hmmm, where is Larry?

18:23.863 --> 18:25.040
- Yeah?

18:25.040 --> 18:26.070
Where's Larry?

18:26.070 --> 18:31.070
- You know Santa, Larry's
been acting strange lately.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.930
- How so?

18:34.930 --> 18:38.120
- He has been complaining that
Christmas plays out the same

18:38.120 --> 18:41.820
every year and he's bored.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.880
- He things we do the same
stuff and says the same stuff

18:44.880 --> 18:47.650
and think the same stuff
and sing the same song

18:47.650 --> 18:49.640
year in and year out.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.940
- He said he yearns for change

18:53.020 --> 18:56.450
and wants to try new things.

18:56.450 --> 18:57.380
- Oh dear.

18:58.820 --> 19:01.310
What's gotten into him?

19:01.310 --> 19:03.920
- I'm sure it's just a
passing phase, Santa.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.070
Larry's young, you know.

19:06.070 --> 19:08.670
He'll get his antlers on straight.

19:08.670 --> 19:10.890
- I hope you're right, Tinker.

19:10.890 --> 19:14.340
Do you think I should
grant him the holiday off?

19:14.340 --> 19:15.433
- Goodness, no.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.920
- We need all the hooves we can get Santa.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.800
It's tough out there.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.120
The temperature, the pace.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.060
The amount of presence.

19:26.060 --> 19:27.960
- And the comradery.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.020
We never ever work a Christmas eve

19:30.020 --> 19:32.200
without everyone on board.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.880
- And we're not about to start now.

19:34.880 --> 19:39.880
- Yeah, Larry will return
soon Santa, you'll see.

19:41.871 --> 19:43.243
- I sure do hope so.

19:46.210 --> 19:47.966
Gosh Larry.

19:47.966 --> 19:50.120
It seems like we've been walking forever.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.320
Are we almost there?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.940
- Hang in there Sowen, it's not far.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.570
- No, can we see it from here?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.160
Oh, all I see is ice.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.220
- Well, to be fair Sowen,
eyesight isn't exactly

20:02.220 --> 20:03.720
your strong suit.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.760
- Hey, I'm a Christmas
bug, I have other powers

20:06.760 --> 20:08.800
besides sight, I'll let you know.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.100
For example, I can make you
wanna supp for gooey socks

20:12.100 --> 20:13.950
you'll never wear, ever!

20:13.950 --> 20:16.880
I can make you eat too
much and really, really

20:16.880 --> 20:18.500
wanna see your in lots.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.280
- Those are fine powers
to have, Sowen, indeed.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.900
- Hey, how long have we
been out here, anyway?

20:24.900 --> 20:26.880
It feels like it should be dark by now.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.530
- It doesn't get dark here, Sowen.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.210
We're on top of the world.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.140
They don't get sun rotations.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.080
- Oh, huh?

20:44.020 --> 20:46.023
- Hey, who are you two guys?

20:47.530 --> 20:48.760
- Who are you?

20:48.760 --> 20:51.900
- No, we asked you first.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.800
- Yeah, you're on our turf.

20:53.800 --> 20:57.590
If we were on your turf,
we'd introduce ourselves.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.520
- Fair enough.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.200
I'm Sowen the Christmas bug.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.680
And this is my good
buddy, Larry the reindeer.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.430
- Hi, nice to meet you.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.263
I'm Flip.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.560
- And I'm Zoey.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.340
And this is our place.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.610
- Oh, mind if we pass through?

21:10.610 --> 21:13.120
- Not at all, we are penguins.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.680
- Friendly and sociable pack
in the most, at your service.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.380
- You guys look beat.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.160
Need to rest your feet
a while, have a snack.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.530
- Now that you mention it,
I can eat a polar bear.

21:24.530 --> 21:26.500
- Make that two polar bears.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.980
- Well, come on then.

21:28.980 --> 21:33.980
- Flip, Zoey, what did I tell
you being stray animals home?

21:34.720 --> 21:37.240
- Oh, mom, they were really nice.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.780
- Yeah, can we feed them?

21:39.780 --> 21:41.430
- Oh, I don't know.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.424
- We're not wild animals, we're--

21:43.424 --> 21:44.810
- Please.

21:44.810 --> 21:47.020
- They're so cute.

21:47.020 --> 21:51.758
- I'm Larry and that is
Sowen, the holiday tick.

21:51.758 --> 21:54.300
- Bug, holiday bug.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.920
- We're from the North Pole.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.300
- The North Pole?

21:57.300 --> 22:00.560
Ah, that's where Santa lives.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.650
- Whoa, Santa?

22:02.650 --> 22:04.900
- Santa is like, the most.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.490
- Santa is great, sure.

22:06.490 --> 22:09.040
But I'm running Christmas this year.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.030
Any questions or concerns,
you can talk to me.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.250
My door's open anytime.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.170
- You?

22:15.170 --> 22:17.180
- Instead of Santa?

22:17.180 --> 22:19.550
- Yeah, Larry here is
gonna propel Christmas

22:19.550 --> 22:20.763
into the next century.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.290
Something like that.

22:23.290 --> 22:25.360
- I'm on my way to get
my official credentials

22:25.360 --> 22:28.423
from my friend B then I'll run the show.

22:29.740 --> 22:34.400
- No offense Mr. Larry,
but you are no Santa.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.180
- Maybe that's exactly
what this holiday needs.

22:37.180 --> 22:40.150
Somebody who is not
Santa to make Christmas

22:40.150 --> 22:41.400
new and improved.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.290
- I don't think Christmas
needs improving if you ask me.

22:45.290 --> 22:46.703
- Of course it does.

22:47.610 --> 22:51.080
- My penguin senses detect
trouble at the North Pole.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.450
- So, wait, you are like the new Santa?

22:54.450 --> 22:55.283
- Yup.

22:55.283 --> 22:56.116
- Really?
- Really.

22:57.314 --> 23:00.320
- Wow, can I get a polar bear or cob dog

23:00.320 --> 23:01.820
that talks for Christmas?

23:01.820 --> 23:05.500
- Yeah, and can I get
wind up mechanical seagull

23:05.500 --> 23:07.050
that shoots poop?

23:07.050 --> 23:08.770
- Yeah, sure.

23:08.770 --> 23:11.130
- Can I have ice shelf swing?

23:11.130 --> 23:14.260
- And I want chocolate
covered sardine truffles.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.250
- And I want an ice cube puzzle.

23:16.250 --> 23:19.330
Cool, and I want snow play clay.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.110
And I want a nice Frisbee.

23:21.110 --> 23:23.340
And I want a lock in yoyo.

23:23.340 --> 23:26.230
- And I want a pink icicle with streamers.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.717
- And I want a yak wool detective hat.

23:28.717 --> 23:29.670
- Wow.

23:29.670 --> 23:32.263
How did Santa
for you so far, Larry?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.913
- This is odd, you guys.

23:38.359 --> 23:39.359
I'm worried.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.130
- We all have to stay focused, Terry.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.250
We can get through whatever's going on

23:45.250 --> 23:48.060
as long as we stick together.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.300
Christmas is stronger than anything.

23:50.300 --> 23:54.020
Always has been, always will be.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.928
- I hope you're right.

23:55.928 --> 23:57.127
- Ho ho ho, my reindeer.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.950
Why have you summoned me?

24:00.950 --> 24:03.222
- There's an issue, Santa.

24:03.222 --> 24:04.710
- There is?

24:04.710 --> 24:09.340
- Yes, Stella sent a message
asking to see you at once.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.750
She said it's urgent.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.200
- Stella from the land of Ice Light?

24:14.200 --> 24:15.310
- Yup.

24:15.310 --> 24:18.120
- I haven't heard from
Stella in a long time.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.503
It must me serious.

24:20.564 --> 24:24.500
- I wonder if it has
something to do with Larry.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.940
We must leave at once.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.970
You reindeer stay here.

24:27.970 --> 24:30.170
Benny and I will go.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.550
- Copy that Santa.

24:31.550 --> 24:34.530
- Ah, whatever the matter, rest assured,

24:34.530 --> 24:36.463
we'll get to the bottom of it.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.623
This place is spooky.

24:49.623 --> 24:52.482
Nothing good comes from a place Like this.

24:52.482 --> 24:54.680
There's nothing Christmas-y anyway.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.500
- Hold yourself together
Sowen, you're a flea.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.900
A regular vampire.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.550
You drink blood for a living.

25:00.550 --> 25:04.070
- I'm not a flea, I'm a holiday bug.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.360
We all have our specialized diets.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.300
- You do?

25:07.300 --> 25:09.553
Yeah.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.160
Anymore questions?

25:12.160 --> 25:14.090
And why is it so dark here?

25:14.090 --> 25:16.070
I can't see the tip of my nose.

25:16.070 --> 25:19.220
- You don't have a nose, Sowen.

25:19.220 --> 25:22.677
Santa, so
good to see you again.

25:22.677 --> 25:25.186
- How are you Stella?

25:25.186 --> 25:26.940
How are the kids?

25:26.940 --> 25:29.010
- Fine, we're all fine.

25:29.010 --> 25:31.670
But I must tell you the
reason I called you here.

25:33.224 --> 25:34.057
- What is it?

25:34.057 --> 25:35.730
- Your reindeer, Larry.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.910
He does a visit earlier.

25:37.910 --> 25:38.926
- What?

25:38.926 --> 25:41.760
What's Larry doing all the way up

25:41.760 --> 25:43.540
in the land of Ice Light?

25:43.540 --> 25:47.600
- He said that he'd be in
charge of Christmas from now on.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.480
And that he was headed
to see a friend named B

25:50.480 --> 25:53.090
for official instructions.

25:53.090 --> 25:55.460
- A friend named B?

25:55.460 --> 25:58.260
- Yes, do you know this character?

25:58.260 --> 25:59.710
- B, hmm.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.150
I think I do.

26:04.150 --> 26:08.790
There's only one creature who's
had lived beyond this land

26:08.790 --> 26:11.999
and his name starts with B.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.230
- Who is it Santa?

26:13.230 --> 26:18.230
- I fear our Larry is going
to engage the Mighty Bunion.

26:20.260 --> 26:23.845
- Did you say the Mighty Bunion?

26:23.845 --> 26:25.660
- The Mighty Bunion?

26:25.660 --> 26:26.493
Oh no!

26:28.460 --> 26:31.360
- Welcome to my castle Larry.

26:31.360 --> 26:35.060
I think you find it most agreeable.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.680
- It's kinda fall apart, yeah.

26:36.680 --> 26:37.920
- Quiet, tick.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.170
The Mighty Bunion speaks.

26:40.170 --> 26:41.700
- It's nice to be here, B.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.810
And it's nice to meet you.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.393
- It certainly is, isn't it?

26:46.393 --> 26:48.950
What do you say we start at the top

26:48.950 --> 26:53.030
and get rid of old barrels tale ho ho ho.

26:53.030 --> 26:57.480
Before getting down to
Christmas business, eh?

26:57.480 --> 26:59.710
- The what?

26:59.710 --> 27:00.740
You mean Santa?

27:00.740 --> 27:02.710
- Of course, I mean Santa.

27:02.710 --> 27:05.700
Whatever old barrels tale ho ho hos,

27:05.700 --> 27:08.080
whether you know warrant
the attention of a wizard

27:08.080 --> 27:09.490
as wicked as I.

27:09.490 --> 27:14.230
- Wicked oh, this guy look
Santa look like a teenager.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.070
- Silence, flea.

27:16.070 --> 27:18.963
- Now B, when you say "get rid",

27:18.963 --> 27:21.030
what do you mean exactly?

27:21.030 --> 27:25.200
- I mean, making sure
Santa is out of our way.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.460
Yeah, for good.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.207
- Like, for good, for good?

27:28.207 --> 27:30.730
- What's the difference between for good

27:30.730 --> 27:32.500
and for good, for good?

27:32.500 --> 27:35.900
- Well, okay, Santa's gone.

27:35.900 --> 27:40.450
Could imply Santa is gone
on a well-deserved vacation.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.520
While for good, for good, is like,

27:43.520 --> 27:45.430
whoa, Santa's gone gone.

27:45.430 --> 27:48.390
- Is gone gone like a
reindeer speak or something?

27:48.390 --> 27:50.660
- No, it's regular speak.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.050
For good good sounds permanent permanent.

27:53.050 --> 27:55.030
Sowen, you know what I mean, right?

27:55.030 --> 27:57.890
- I still can't see the tip
of my nose, I'll let you know.

27:57.890 --> 27:59.789
- See, Sowen gets it.

27:59.789 --> 28:02.390
To play.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.910
I have no time for games Larry.

28:04.910 --> 28:07.130
Do you want control of Christmas or not?

28:07.130 --> 28:10.020
- Yes, but you're not
gonna hurt Santa, right?

28:10.020 --> 28:11.373
- Of course not.

28:12.870 --> 28:14.090
Not too much.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.290
- Oh, right.

28:15.290 --> 28:16.440
I'm ready then.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.630
- Very well.

28:17.630 --> 28:22.260
This spell I now cast will
get Santa out of the way,

28:22.260 --> 28:27.260
paving the way for you
to assume his throne.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.250
- He doesn't sit on a throne though.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.930
He just has like a chair.

28:31.930 --> 28:34.470
- Four of them, wooden ones.

28:34.470 --> 28:37.210
- Yeah, around his dining table.

28:37.210 --> 28:38.830
- He has no reading chair too.

28:38.830 --> 28:40.790
Now that's comfortable.

28:40.790 --> 28:42.907
I sat in it one time.

28:42.907 --> 28:43.820
- Enough!

28:43.820 --> 28:46.040
A throne was just a figure of speech.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.040
I don't care what Santa sits on.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.630
- Okay, don't get your
beard up all in a knot.

28:50.630 --> 28:54.060
- My beard is not tied all up in a knot.

28:54.060 --> 28:57.260
- A beard is so up ina
knot that if I were a flea

28:57.260 --> 28:58.330
I'll start laying in the ground

28:58.330 --> 29:00.200
were for a snazzy condo in there.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.250
- Quiet, I'm going to cast my spell now.

29:03.250 --> 29:04.930
No interruptions.

29:04.930 --> 29:09.500
Wing of raven, beard of goat.

29:09.500 --> 29:13.400
Now you see him, at the end you don't.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.873
I have newtt and boy, old prawn.

29:17.800 --> 29:22.560
He once was there but now he's gone.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.393
- Is that it?

29:23.393 --> 29:24.853
- Yes Larry, that's it.

29:27.670 --> 29:30.630
- You feel mighty or anything?

29:30.630 --> 29:33.440
- I don't know, I think so.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.633
Do I look mighty?

29:35.930 --> 29:38.030
- Maybe like try to stand up straighter.

29:38.030 --> 29:41.780
- Don't worry North Polites, my spell's

29:41.780 --> 29:44.547
never missed their targets.

29:44.547 --> 29:48.290
Although, we are so far up
on the top of this world,

29:48.290 --> 29:51.570
there's just a beat of a leg.

29:51.570 --> 29:55.000
Kinda like the live TV delay, you know.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.960
My vanishing spell shoot me taking effect

29:57.960 --> 30:01.380
right about now.

30:01.380 --> 30:04.810
- There's only one way I know to combat

30:04.810 --> 30:07.560
the Mighty Bunion's evil spells

30:07.560 --> 30:09.379
and that's to--

30:09.379 --> 30:10.922
- Santa!

30:10.922 --> 30:11.755
- Oh no!

30:12.948 --> 30:14.286
- Santa?

30:14.286 --> 30:15.357
Santa, where are you?>

30:19.280 --> 30:24.280
- It is done North Polites,
congratulations Larry.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.900
Christmas is, if you
still wanna call it that,

30:28.900 --> 30:31.300
now yours.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.400
- Wow, that was easy.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.120
And Santa's in the Swiss Alps, you say?

30:36.120 --> 30:40.070
- Yeah, having a grand old time.

30:40.070 --> 30:43.040
Skiing and drinking eggnog.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.670
- Oh, goodie.

30:44.670 --> 30:48.960
- Are you ready to run
the Christmas reindeer?

30:48.960 --> 30:50.400
- I sure am.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.423
Where do I start?

30:52.680 --> 30:54.763
Oh, right.

30:54.763 --> 30:56.943
Is there anything I can write with?

30:58.272 --> 31:00.470
- We're almost done Clank.

31:01.928 --> 31:06.140
Hold your joints, cling your chassy.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.800
Turn up your spark plugs.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.213
You should be good for
another season easy.

31:13.137 --> 31:15.080
- Excellent Lag.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.090
You're the best mechanic of metal cell

31:18.090 --> 31:21.057
containing a magically guns an evil spirit

31:21.057 --> 31:23.350
can ever hope for.

31:23.350 --> 31:26.336
- No, thanks Clank.

31:26.336 --> 31:29.820
So, is Mighty Bunion
really giving Christmas

31:29.820 --> 31:31.273
to that reindeer?

31:32.220 --> 31:33.293
- Affirmative.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.510
I was kinda hoping to get
a crack out of myself.

31:40.510 --> 31:43.900
I think I'd do a pretty good job with it.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.283
- Negative.

31:46.550 --> 31:50.100
- I know Bunion always
sees me as a heavy lifter

31:51.150 --> 31:54.203
but I could do more, is all I'm saying.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.910
If I just got a chance.

31:56.910 --> 32:01.023
- Are you entering our New
Year supervillain potluck?

32:02.365 --> 32:04.060
- I didn't know about it.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.690
How do I enter?

32:06.690 --> 32:08.853
- Just give Bella a tow.

32:11.342 --> 32:12.743
- A tow?

32:12.743 --> 32:15.150
- Yes, a tow.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.260
- You mean like--

32:17.260 --> 32:21.030
- Oh, wrap one off, put it in the hat.

32:21.030 --> 32:24.540
If Bunion picks it out on New Year's day,

32:24.540 --> 32:28.592
you'll be granted your
own kingdom to lord over.

32:28.592 --> 32:29.592
- Wow, okay.

32:33.010 --> 32:34.410
- Are we almost done Lag?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.463
I need to use the bathroom.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.920
- Now I'm really starting to worry.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.453
Santa's been gone a long time.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.520
- Yeah, he never takes this slow on a run.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.410
Especially so close to the big day.

32:50.410 --> 32:54.230
- I don't think there's cause
for alarm just yet guys.

32:54.230 --> 32:57.350
This is a special circumstance after all.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.900
When's the last time we had a
dissector at the North Pole?

33:00.900 --> 33:02.590
- I can't remember.

33:02.590 --> 33:04.500
- Me neither.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.010
- That's because there's never been one.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.850
This is a happy place.

33:08.850 --> 33:13.850
Full of kindness and cheer,
we've never known anything else.

33:14.210 --> 33:16.390
And we never will.

33:16.390 --> 33:17.550
- You think?

33:17.550 --> 33:18.553
- I know.

33:19.450 --> 33:21.530
- But what if Larry doesn't come back?

33:21.530 --> 33:23.570
- Perry, that's silly talk.

33:23.570 --> 33:25.400
Santa will bring Larry home.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.007
Even if he oust a dragon by the outliers.

33:30.223 --> 33:32.190
- That'd be a funny sight.

33:32.190 --> 33:33.550
- Sure would be.

33:33.550 --> 33:35.910
- We'll wait a little while longer.

33:35.910 --> 33:38.520
And if there's still no sign of Santa,

33:38.520 --> 33:40.630
we'll go find him ourselves.

33:40.630 --> 33:43.153
We have a Christmas to organize.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.310
- Okay, this is it.

33:50.310 --> 33:53.600
Christmas is in my hooves.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.040
Time to show them what I got.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.920
Santa will be so proud of me.

33:56.920 --> 34:01.560
- Ah, the power of Christmas
is within you, yes?

34:02.750 --> 34:07.750
- Yes B, I feel powerful,
all warm and Christmas-y.

34:09.753 --> 34:13.460
- Great, now it's time to enact
the second part of my plan.

34:13.460 --> 34:16.320
- Oh, cool icicles.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.318
What is it?

34:17.318 --> 34:22.318
Oh, you leave that to me.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.184
- Check that.

34:23.184 --> 34:27.493
- When you meet your
friends again, stay calm.

34:28.550 --> 34:31.090
And remember my orders.

34:31.090 --> 34:31.922
- Got it.

34:31.922 --> 34:34.560
- Assure them that you cherish Christmas

34:34.560 --> 34:37.170
every beat as much as they do.

34:37.170 --> 34:40.000
None eh, more so.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.460
And now that Santa's gone, it's up to you

34:44.460 --> 34:46.130
to run the Christmas.

34:46.130 --> 34:48.639
- Yes, I won't let you down.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.800
- I know you won't Larry.

34:51.800 --> 34:56.460
That's why I chose you to
lead the most popular holiday

34:56.460 --> 34:59.140
the world has ever known.

34:59.140 --> 35:03.133
- I'll make you proud B,
I'll make everyone proud.

35:03.133 --> 35:04.500
- Atta boy!

35:04.500 --> 35:06.153
Go get them Larry.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.390
- Hey everybody, I'm back.

35:09.390 --> 35:11.013
- Whoa, Larry!

35:11.854 --> 35:13.930
- When did you get back?

35:13.930 --> 35:17.680
- Just now, ho ho ho, Merry Christmas!

35:17.680 --> 35:20.090
- Hold it right there Larry.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.380
You can't use that phrase.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.460
- Says who?

35:23.460 --> 35:25.500
- Says Santa.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.820
- Santa is in the Swiss Alps
having a grand old time.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.353
Skiing and drinking eggnog.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.930
- He is?

35:34.930 --> 35:37.950
- Yes, he deserved a
vacation, don't you think?

35:37.950 --> 35:42.600
And as Santa's favorite
reindeer, I'm in charge now.

35:42.600 --> 35:46.190
Santa's favorite reindeer?

35:46.190 --> 35:47.810
Don't make me laugh.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.960
I just had too much alfalfa.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.780
I might burst.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.450
- Hey, he always complimented my trot

35:54.450 --> 35:56.380
and my elegant antler.

35:56.380 --> 35:58.800
- Oh please, you are a slow poke.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.320
- You're limp.

36:00.320 --> 36:04.503
- And you ask for a bathroom
break every two miles.

36:05.410 --> 36:07.030
- Well, nevermind that.

36:07.030 --> 36:11.470
I'm in charge now and Christmas
will be new and improved.

36:11.470 --> 36:16.253
- But Larry, we love
Christmas just the way it is.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.950
- You'll like it even more
now that I'm in charge.

36:19.950 --> 36:24.494
Trust me, ho ho ho, ho, ho, ho.

36:24.494 --> 36:28.250
- Whoa, Santa's gone gone.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.770
- I see that.

36:29.770 --> 36:33.730
- You mean that goofy deer
isn't Santa after all?

36:33.730 --> 36:36.550
- And now, the real Santa's gone gone?

36:36.550 --> 36:39.880
- What about my polar
bear, cob dog that talks?

36:39.880 --> 36:42.140
- What about my wind up mechanical seagull

36:42.140 --> 36:43.920
that shoots poop?

36:43.920 --> 36:45.970
- What about my ice shelf swing?

36:45.970 --> 36:49.650
- What about my chocolate
covered sardine truffles?

36:49.650 --> 36:51.990
- What about my ice cube puzzle?

36:51.990 --> 36:54.260
- What about my snow play clay?

36:54.260 --> 36:56.620
- What about my ice Frisbee?

36:56.620 --> 36:58.720
- What about my lock in yoyo?

36:58.720 --> 37:02.250
- What about my pink
icicle with streamers?

37:02.250 --> 37:06.267
- What about my yak wool detective hat?

37:10.520 --> 37:11.900
- What about Christmas?

37:11.900 --> 37:13.620
It'll be here for all we know it.

37:13.620 --> 37:16.310
Without Santa, it'll be ruined.

37:16.310 --> 37:20.370
- Santa has obviously fallen
victim to an evil spell.

37:20.370 --> 37:24.930
I know a creature who wields
powerful magic of his own.,

37:24.930 --> 37:25.991
- You do?

37:25.991 --> 37:26.950
Who?

37:26.950 --> 37:30.750
- His name is Baba Bartholomew Briskit.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.270
Bart, for short.

37:32.270 --> 37:34.790
And he may be our only chance.

37:34.790 --> 37:36.450
- How do I find him?

37:36.450 --> 37:38.000
- Sprout will take you there.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.100
- Sprout?

37:39.100 --> 37:42.120
- Yeah, he's a kindly tunder fungus.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.250
Grows around here somewhere.

37:44.250 --> 37:45.153
Hey Sprout!

37:47.080 --> 37:50.390
- You know, this place is really comfy.

37:50.390 --> 37:53.060
I never spent much time in here before.

37:53.060 --> 37:57.240
- That's because it's not
your place it's Santa's.

37:57.240 --> 38:00.930
- Now, Tinker, what did
I tell you about Santa?

38:00.930 --> 38:02.540
The Swiss Alps, remember?

38:02.540 --> 38:04.450
- It doesn't matter what you told me

38:04.450 --> 38:08.010
because you are not the boss, Santa is.

38:08.010 --> 38:11.330
And he'll come back, I just know he will.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.590
- Christmas is right around the corner.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.120
And we have yet to set an official plan

38:16.120 --> 38:17.800
for the North Pole.

38:17.800 --> 38:21.471
- That's because Santa
sets the plan Larry.

38:21.471 --> 38:24.000
- I have some ideas of my own.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.500
- I'm sure they're just wonderful.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.560
- Now that's the spirit.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.190
Would you like me to
tell you some of them?

38:29.190 --> 38:31.030
- Do I have a choice?

38:31.030 --> 38:33.400
- Well, nope.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.360
- In that case, tell away.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.193
- Great!

38:37.193 --> 38:40.610
First, I'm thinking of updating
the gift giving dynamic.

38:40.610 --> 38:41.900
- Updating?

38:41.900 --> 38:45.210
- Yeah, we'll do email
gift cards for those

38:45.210 --> 38:47.620
we don't care so much about, one click

38:47.620 --> 38:49.210
and they're taken care of.

38:49.210 --> 38:50.960
- How personal.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.370
- Not at all.

38:52.370 --> 38:53.690
That's the point.

38:53.690 --> 38:56.600
You don't wanna be stuck
buying gifts for them anyway.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.020
They'll eventually see
that they're never going

38:59.020 --> 39:02.420
to get a gift from us and they'll go away.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.690
- You can't be serious.

39:04.690 --> 39:05.840
- Of course I am.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.340
And for those loves ones
who we do care about,

39:09.340 --> 39:11.200
we're gonna switch things up a little bit.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.330
- Switch things up, how?

39:13.330 --> 39:16.320
- I'm thinking of a Christmas egg hunt.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.010
- An egg hunt?

39:18.010 --> 39:21.780
- Yeah, we'll stash small
gifts inside decorative eggs

39:21.780 --> 39:24.930
and hide them all around the houses.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.410
On Christmas morning, children
will search for the eggs

39:27.410 --> 39:29.010
to find their presents.

39:29.010 --> 39:30.310
- Really?

39:30.310 --> 39:32.340
- Really, what do you think?

39:32.340 --> 39:34.183
- I think that's Easter.

39:35.770 --> 39:38.860
- Right, it is kinda similar, huh?

39:38.860 --> 39:39.883
- Kinda.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.580
- Thanks for coming with me Sprout.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.110
I don't think I could deal with the dragon

39:44.110 --> 39:48.000
all by myself, even if he is friendly.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.160
- No worries Benny.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.780
Anything I can do to help someone

39:50.780 --> 39:52.270
having trouble on the tunder.

39:52.270 --> 39:53.200
I'll do it.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.210
I'm a kindly fungus.

39:55.210 --> 39:57.080
- A kindly fungus?

39:57.080 --> 40:00.630
- Yeah, we're an arctic
species, quite rare.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.860
We only grow on east facing ice shells

40:02.860 --> 40:05.410
in an elf dung after our major rain.

40:06.401 --> 40:07.234
- Wow!

40:08.070 --> 40:11.180
- We kindly fungus don't get
to see many new faces up here

40:11.180 --> 40:14.640
so anytime we do, it's
always a special occasion.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.183
- Christmas is a special occasion too.

40:18.340 --> 40:22.270
I just don't know if we'll ever
have it again without Santa.

40:22.270 --> 40:23.890
Don't be Benny.

40:23.890 --> 40:27.380
You can take Santa out of
Christmas but you can never

40:27.380 --> 40:29.360
take Christmas out of Santa.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.410
That jolly old fella will be back.

40:31.410 --> 40:33.400
Mark my words.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.800
- You really think so?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.660
- I sure do, come on.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.180
Let's find that bubble
bob follow me whisket

40:39.180 --> 40:40.423
and see what he thinks.

40:41.590 --> 40:44.220
- Larry, I just don't see why Christmas

40:44.220 --> 40:45.800
needs to be different.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.678
It's the greatest holiday ever.

40:48.678 --> 40:51.100
It doesn't need updating.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.763
It doesn't need to change with the times.

40:54.850 --> 40:57.700
It doesn't need a brothel uphill.

40:57.700 --> 41:02.377
Christmas is perfect in every way.

41:03.810 --> 41:05.810
- I'd listen to him Larry.

41:05.810 --> 41:07.830
He knows what he's talking about.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.070
He's a North Pole reindeer.

41:10.070 --> 41:12.210
And so are you.

41:12.210 --> 41:13.270
- Just hear me out.

41:13.270 --> 41:14.370
How about this?

41:14.370 --> 41:17.800
Everybody's sick and tired
of wrapping presents, right?

41:17.800 --> 41:19.090
- Wrong!

41:19.090 --> 41:23.620
- In place of gifts, we'll
do a Christmas turkey dinner

41:23.620 --> 41:24.930
with all the fixins.

41:24.930 --> 41:27.710
- Are you serious?

41:27.710 --> 41:28.860
- Absolutely.

41:28.860 --> 41:31.680
It's cheaper, it brings
families closer together,

41:31.680 --> 41:35.220
there's less waste and the
dogs can handle the leftovers

41:35.220 --> 41:36.910
and their turkey bones.

41:36.910 --> 41:39.980
- It's also called Thanksgiving.

41:39.980 --> 41:42.790
- Ah, that's right.

41:42.790 --> 41:45.610
Okay, I have other ideas.

41:45.610 --> 41:47.180
- See what I mean?

41:47.180 --> 41:48.883
- Oh boy.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.611
Christmas is in trouble.

41:55.820 --> 41:59.850
- It sure is cold in
here Sprout, and damp.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.160
I wish I had a cap like yours.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.580
It seems to repel wetness and fog.

42:05.580 --> 42:08.480
- You can't get one like
this off the rag Benny.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.110
You're either born with it or you're not.

42:12.110 --> 42:14.237
- I guess I'm out of luck then, brrrr.

42:19.090 --> 42:20.540
- Not for much longer.

42:20.540 --> 42:24.510
Hey, it's Snag, long time no see.

42:24.510 --> 42:27.577
'Sup Sproutster, I ain't seen
you since ice old.

42:28.540 --> 42:29.430
Who this?

42:29.430 --> 42:31.100
- This is my old friend, Benny.

42:31.100 --> 42:33.870
He's from the North Pole.

42:33.870 --> 42:35.900
- North Pole, huh?

42:35.900 --> 42:39.256
I didn't know there'd yard
gnomes in the North Pole.

42:40.470 --> 42:41.440
- Yard gnomes?

42:41.440 --> 42:43.440
I'm not a yard gnome.

42:43.440 --> 42:44.933
I'm a Christmas elf.

42:45.910 --> 42:49.620
- I bet they all say that
round this time of the year.

42:49.620 --> 42:52.590
- Snag, we're in a jam.

42:52.590 --> 42:55.100
Do you think we can see your dad?

42:55.100 --> 42:56.180
- From here?

42:56.180 --> 42:57.260
Don't know.

42:57.260 --> 42:58.513
How far an you see?

43:00.484 --> 43:01.317
- I--

43:02.150 --> 43:03.330
- I'm just playing with you.

43:03.330 --> 43:05.283
Come on, y'all, he's over this way.

43:09.970 --> 43:11.730
- I got it, I got it!

43:11.730 --> 43:12.750
How about this?

43:12.750 --> 43:15.600
We do Christmas costumes and candy.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.560
Everyone dresses up and goes door to door

43:18.560 --> 43:21.083
collecting goodies from
everyone they meet.

43:23.030 --> 43:24.880
I know, I know.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.560
That's what they do on
St. Patrick's day, right?

43:27.560 --> 43:30.133
Ah, well done, back to the drawing board.

43:31.380 --> 43:32.833
- What are we going to do?

43:34.430 --> 43:36.450
- How do we stop this
madness without Santa?

43:36.450 --> 43:40.440
- How long do you think Santa
will stay in the Swiss Alps?

43:40.440 --> 43:42.390
- Do they have eggnog in the Swiss Alps?

43:42.390 --> 43:43.870
- I think so.

43:43.870 --> 43:45.610
- Then, a while.

43:45.610 --> 43:47.400
- Updating our holidays.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.900
You guys, my brainy's on break.

43:49.900 --> 43:53.730
I'm gonna sleep and start first
thing fresh in the morning.

43:53.730 --> 43:56.010
- Thank heaven for small miracles.

43:56.010 --> 43:57.970
- Oh, I got it.

43:57.970 --> 44:00.233
We'll fly gifts in on kites.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.890
- Hey pop, got some
visitors who wanna see ya.

44:05.890 --> 44:07.097
- Visitors?

44:07.097 --> 44:08.410
Up here?

44:08.410 --> 44:10.040
Must be important.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.980
- It is, Mr. Baba Bartholomew Briskit.

44:12.980 --> 44:15.910
Sorry if we're disturbing you.

44:15.910 --> 44:17.143
- Call me Bart.

44:18.434 --> 44:21.550
Hey, you're all growing up fast Sprout.

44:21.550 --> 44:25.270
Last time I laid eyes on you,
you were just a filament.

44:25.270 --> 44:26.700
How's Stella?

44:26.700 --> 44:29.160
- Getting fish like a pro.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.000
- That sounds like the Stella I know.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.860
Tell them my offer of a
cook Alps still stands.

44:34.860 --> 44:38.133
Just not in the middle of
that icy lake like last time.

44:38.966 --> 44:40.010
That was cold.

44:40.010 --> 44:42.930
Tell me there fellas,
what brings you here?

44:42.930 --> 44:44.270
- My name's Benny.

44:44.270 --> 44:47.130
I'm Santa's newest elf
from the North Pole.

44:47.130 --> 44:48.270
- Santa?

44:48.270 --> 44:50.370
How is that old cutter?

44:50.370 --> 44:54.710
- Well, not good.

44:54.710 --> 44:56.467
- Oh? Is he ill?

44:59.262 --> 45:01.393
- He's gone.

45:01.393 --> 45:02.298
- Gone?

45:02.298 --> 45:04.010
What do you mean gone?

45:04.010 --> 45:05.960
- He was stricken by an evil spell.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.500
And he disappeared.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.750
- No.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.850
- Right in front of our eyes.

45:13.850 --> 45:15.980
- Well, get out.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.522
- This is terrible news.

45:18.522 --> 45:22.563
- But worse, I love
Christmas and even more,

45:23.880 --> 45:27.393
I love getting Christmas presents.

45:28.430 --> 45:31.180
- You know, way back when
I was accidentally tapped

45:31.180 --> 45:33.450
to lead Santa's sleigh.

45:33.450 --> 45:34.685
- You were?

45:35.840 --> 45:36.763
Really?

45:38.730 --> 45:41.590
- I was, but at the
last minute, Santa felt

45:41.590 --> 45:45.160
that a goofy deer was less
scary than a fire-breathing

45:45.160 --> 45:47.570
dragon, it's there he made the switch.

45:47.570 --> 45:50.480
And that's how y'all got those reindeer.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.240
- Wow, I didn't know that.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.340
- Oh, we agree to keep that hush, hush.

45:55.340 --> 45:58.530
Tell me Benny, do you
know who cast the spell

45:58.530 --> 46:00.960
that made Santa disappear?

46:00.960 --> 46:03.720
- Well, before it
happened, Santa mentioned

46:03.720 --> 46:07.153
something about a Mighty Bunion.

46:08.561 --> 46:09.987
- The Mighty Bunion?

46:10.930 --> 46:12.080
- Is that bad?

46:12.080 --> 46:13.960
- It doesn't get much worse.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.890
If what you say is true, Benny,

46:15.890 --> 46:18.250
we have no time to spare.

46:18.250 --> 46:22.100
It's been a while, my magic might be rusty

46:22.100 --> 46:24.730
but I'm gonna try a spell of our own

46:24.730 --> 46:28.940
to counteract any magic
that's holding Santa captive.

46:28.940 --> 46:30.530
- You do magic pop?

46:30.530 --> 46:32.030
I never knew.

46:32.030 --> 46:35.210
- There's lots of things
you don't know son.

46:35.210 --> 46:36.560
All in due time.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.560
Stand clear, y'all.

46:38.560 --> 46:43.550
Illuminate this shadow,
show the hiding place.

46:43.550 --> 46:48.003
Deliver before us my
friend's smiling face.

46:50.550 --> 46:51.400
Blast it.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.710
Just a fungus from the grass lands.

46:53.710 --> 46:54.933
Let me try again.

46:55.930 --> 46:59.610
- I feel lousy, you guys.

46:59.610 --> 47:03.020
With each passing second,
Christmas is slipping

47:03.020 --> 47:04.733
through out antlers.

47:06.230 --> 47:08.770
There's nothing we can do about it.

47:08.770 --> 47:10.980
- Now that we're seen as reindeer,

47:10.980 --> 47:12.240
we're not just gonna sit and watch

47:12.240 --> 47:14.380
our holiday go down the
troops, we're responsible

47:14.380 --> 47:17.430
for bringing joy to
households around the world

47:17.430 --> 47:19.530
and we'll do it again.

47:19.530 --> 47:21.260
With or without Santa.

47:21.260 --> 47:26.040
- I agree with you both
and I also disagree.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.928
- Whatever do you mean Tinker?

47:27.928 --> 47:31.080
- I mean, melping around the North Pole,

47:31.080 --> 47:35.220
imagining what might've
been, won't get us anywhere.

47:35.220 --> 47:38.820
And neither will trying to
fill Santa's boots ourselves.

47:38.820 --> 47:40.450
- You have any better suggestions?

47:40.450 --> 47:43.490
- As a matter of fact, I do.

47:43.490 --> 47:47.190
We're going to go find
Santa and bring him home.

47:47.190 --> 47:49.080
- We will?
- Yes!

47:49.080 --> 47:52.470
Perry, you come with me,
Terry, you keep an eye

47:52.470 --> 47:54.640
on everything while we're gone.

47:54.640 --> 47:55.603
- Copy that.

47:57.210 --> 47:58.573
- Thank you for trying.

47:59.450 --> 48:02.030
I understand if there's
nothing you can do.

48:02.030 --> 48:03.760
- Nothing I can do?

48:03.760 --> 48:06.603
Gnome, you don't know me very well.

48:07.789 --> 48:10.080
- I'm not a gnome, I'm a Christmas--

48:10.080 --> 48:11.940
- Stand back everyone!

48:11.940 --> 48:13.730
- Oh right, pop.

48:13.730 --> 48:15.880
Make some magic happen.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.500
- Hush boy, I need to concentrate.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.250
- Right, sorry.

48:20.250 --> 48:23.920
- Memories strong for my long lost friend.

48:23.920 --> 48:27.543
Break hove and spells
and bring him back again.

48:29.950 --> 48:32.630
- Well, would you look at that?

48:32.630 --> 48:34.620
- It's another mushroom.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.340
- Mushrooms are cute.

48:36.340 --> 48:37.403
Way to go pop.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.230
I'm rusty.

48:41.230 --> 48:44.030
- This is marvelous Clank.

48:44.030 --> 48:47.590
Everything is going according to my plan.

48:47.590 --> 48:50.750
- How so master?

48:50.750 --> 48:51.583
- How so?

48:52.469 --> 48:54.830
I'll tell you how so.

48:54.830 --> 48:59.250
My arch and nemesis Santa is gone forever.

48:59.250 --> 49:02.670
And he's off for holiday survival rest

49:02.670 --> 49:06.470
on the shaky shoulders
of that goofy reindeer,

49:06.470 --> 49:08.110
that's how so.

49:08.110 --> 49:11.230
- Others beings around the
castle would've enjoyed

49:11.230 --> 49:13.971
the chance to control Christmas.

49:13.971 --> 49:15.733
- Other beings?

49:16.740 --> 49:17.703
Like who?

49:19.005 --> 49:21.355
- Lag expressed interest.

49:21.355 --> 49:22.188
- Lag?

49:23.260 --> 49:27.210
He never stopped opening
his own presents long enough

49:27.210 --> 49:28.810
to get out of his room.

49:28.810 --> 49:31.723
And ruin the holiday for anybody.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.030
Who else?

49:34.030 --> 49:39.030
- Well, I also had some ideas master.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.333
- You?

49:43.270 --> 49:46.650
What would a recycled heap
of metal held together

49:46.650 --> 49:50.730
by a magic spell, containing
the imprisoned spirit

49:50.730 --> 49:52.770
of a medieval peasant?

49:52.770 --> 49:55.420
Possibly wandering Christmas.

49:55.420 --> 49:59.880
- Well, if I had the
chance, I'd do a better job

49:59.880 --> 50:01.517
than that reindeer.

50:01.517 --> 50:03.320
- That's just it Clank.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.500
I don't want someone to do a better job.

50:06.500 --> 50:10.030
I didn't appoint Larry the reindeer

50:10.030 --> 50:11.843
so that Christmas would survive.

50:12.690 --> 50:16.780
I did this so it will be ruined.

50:16.780 --> 50:20.670
Done as by
Santa's disappearance.

50:20.670 --> 50:25.670
Then finished off by a
new incompetent leader,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.623
completely ruined.

50:29.700 --> 50:34.700
- Surely your evil vision
has no limits master.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.333
- A world we saw the yuletide.

50:39.260 --> 50:44.240
Children without smiles, fur
trees without the bubbles.

50:44.240 --> 50:48.310
Have you ever laid eyes on a
fur tree without bubbles Clank?

50:48.310 --> 50:49.423
- Well, no.

50:51.540 --> 50:55.153
- You haven't seen nothing then.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.820
- I guess this is it Sprout.

50:58.820 --> 51:03.350
Santa's gone and Christmas
as we know it is over.

51:03.350 --> 51:04.420
- Come on Benny.

51:04.420 --> 51:07.010
Let's give Bart one more chance.

51:07.010 --> 51:09.280
He's trying really hard.

51:09.280 --> 51:13.330
- Yeah, don't count my pop
out, he's a top dragon.

51:13.330 --> 51:16.460
- He's great at making
mushrooms, I see that.

51:16.460 --> 51:18.870
But mushrooms are simple organisms,

51:18.870 --> 51:23.210
made up of a mass of thread
like form of mycelium.

51:23.210 --> 51:25.370
Santa's made of flesh and bones.

51:25.370 --> 51:29.430
I'm afraid that Mighty Bunion's
magic is just too strong.

51:29.430 --> 51:31.610
- Too strong you say?

51:31.610 --> 51:33.970
Too strong for me?

51:33.970 --> 51:36.007
Ba-ba-Bartholomew Briskit?

51:36.007 --> 51:37.480
I'll show you.

51:37.480 --> 51:40.210
- Well y'all, move back, move bacK.

51:40.210 --> 51:42.430
Give pop some room.

51:42.430 --> 51:44.060
- Come on Ba-Bartholomew.

51:44.060 --> 51:46.090
Third time's the charm.

51:46.090 --> 51:50.270
- You think that I'm soft,
but pop's no pushover.

51:50.270 --> 51:53.670
I'll wrap that evil spell
in a four leaf clover.

51:53.670 --> 51:57.470
Throw a wizard across the
ocean and have no fear.

51:57.470 --> 52:00.800
Santa was there, but now, Santa is here.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.337
- Santa, Santa!

52:08.491 --> 52:10.600
- I'm telling you, when we
find that no good wizard,

52:10.600 --> 52:13.740
I'm gonna show him what
these antlers can do.

52:13.740 --> 52:15.600
- What's the point?

52:15.600 --> 52:19.360
Fighting only creates more enemies.

52:19.360 --> 52:23.410
I think the world without
Christmas is bad enough.

52:23.410 --> 52:25.810
- Don't let doubt drag you down boys.

52:25.810 --> 52:27.320
We're almost there.

52:27.320 --> 52:31.140
And if anyone can rescue Santa, it's us.

52:31.140 --> 52:34.200
His trusty Christmas reindeer.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.133
- Let's do it.

52:36.110 --> 52:39.838
- Benny, little Sprout, big Bart!

52:39.838 --> 52:40.671
And...

52:41.620 --> 52:42.780
- I'm Snag.

52:42.780 --> 52:45.440
And I'm gonna work on your sleigh one day.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.350
- Now, now, now son.

52:47.350 --> 52:49.762
Let Santa get his bearings.

52:49.762 --> 52:50.929
- Ho ho ho ho.

52:52.307 --> 52:55.350
A trip off the old block I see.

52:55.350 --> 52:56.757
- Something like that.

52:56.757 --> 53:00.500
- I'll keep a spot open for you, Snag.

53:00.500 --> 53:04.178
Yon just call me when you're ready, okay?

53:04.178 --> 53:05.011
- Okay!

53:06.090 --> 53:07.920
Did you hear that pops?

53:07.920 --> 53:08.980
- I did.

53:08.980 --> 53:10.670
Sounds like you have a better shot

53:10.670 --> 53:12.730
than your old man did kid.

53:12.730 --> 53:15.139
- Santa, where have you been?

53:15.139 --> 53:17.600
- A dreadful place.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.723
- The center of the Earth?

53:19.723 --> 53:21.740
- No, the Swiss Alps.

53:21.740 --> 53:24.594
And they had no eggnog.

53:24.594 --> 53:26.620
Lahowa!

53:26.620 --> 53:29.430
- Thank you guys for rescuing me.

53:29.430 --> 53:32.530
- That's what friends are for Santa.

53:32.530 --> 53:36.210
- Yeah, we keep it magical around here.

53:36.210 --> 53:39.030
- Well, come to the North Pole and keep it

53:39.030 --> 53:41.360
magical there sometime.

53:41.360 --> 53:45.030
You all have a standing dinner invitation.

53:45.030 --> 53:46.300
- Really?

53:46.300 --> 53:48.580
Oh, how cool.

53:48.580 --> 53:50.460
- We'll take you up on that Santa.

53:50.460 --> 53:55.166
But be warned, we dragons
have big stomachs.

53:55.166 --> 53:56.670
- I know it Bart.

53:56.670 --> 54:00.340
I'll have Mrs. Clause start cooking now.

54:00.340 --> 54:02.910
Well, we must go now.

54:02.910 --> 54:06.492
I believe we have a holiday to save.

54:06.492 --> 54:07.325
- Yey!

54:09.002 --> 54:10.710
- This is so awesome, Mighty B.

54:10.710 --> 54:12.810
Thanks for letting me stay in your castle.

54:14.409 --> 54:18.080
- My name is not Mighty B, flea.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.460
Call me Mighty Bunion.

54:20.460 --> 54:21.970
That is my name.

54:21.970 --> 54:23.820
- Oh yeah, my bad.

54:23.820 --> 54:25.170
I'm sorry Mighty Bunion.

54:25.170 --> 54:27.880
You know, I just wanna say
again how grateful I am

54:27.880 --> 54:29.710
for what you've done for Christmas.

54:29.710 --> 54:33.210
For a minute there, I was afraid
it would be ruined forever.

54:33.210 --> 54:36.570
But your quick thinking
and wise decision making

54:36.570 --> 54:39.620
has preserved our holiday
for generations to come.

54:39.620 --> 54:40.453
- What?

54:41.393 --> 54:43.180
What do you mean?

54:43.180 --> 54:46.230
- I think you've made Christmas
even stronger than ever.

54:46.230 --> 54:49.480
You may not get credit for
that now, but you will.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.313
Trust me.

54:50.313 --> 54:52.610
History loves a winner.

54:52.610 --> 54:55.220
And I believe the Mighty
Bunion and Christmas

54:55.220 --> 54:57.573
will go down as the
greatest pairing since,

54:59.430 --> 55:01.370
since peanut butter and jelly.

55:01.370 --> 55:04.720
- I detest peanut butter and jelly.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.690
- Peanut butter and chocolate then.

55:06.690 --> 55:08.850
My point is, naming Larry the reindeer

55:08.850 --> 55:12.833
as the new head of Christmas
even if he's a little green,

55:13.800 --> 55:15.750
especially if he's a little green,

55:15.750 --> 55:18.600
is only gonna make
Christmas bigger than ever.

55:18.600 --> 55:19.650
- Oh?

55:19.650 --> 55:22.331
What makes you think of that tick?

55:22.331 --> 55:24.110
- Psychic psychology.

55:24.110 --> 55:26.900
People all over the world
will relate to Larry's spite.

55:26.900 --> 55:30.170
The fish out of the water, underdog,

55:30.170 --> 55:33.311
thrown into a job he cannot qualify for.

55:33.311 --> 55:38.311
Succeeding against all odds,
they'll see themselves in him.

55:38.620 --> 55:41.680
Get behind him, cheer him on.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.830
Christmas will be the big winner.

55:44.830 --> 55:46.470
So thanks Mighty Bunion.

55:46.470 --> 55:50.520
Thanks for saving Christmas
and bringing joy to the world.

55:50.520 --> 55:52.363
- Joy to the world?

55:53.510 --> 55:54.763
We'll see about that.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.020
- Hey, look, here's somebody.

55:59.020 --> 56:02.930
- Oh look, mama, more
cute stray creatures.

56:02.930 --> 56:04.870
- Now, don't try to
feed them until we know

56:04.870 --> 56:06.480
what they are kids.

56:06.480 --> 56:09.120
- We are reindeer from the North Pole.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.850
- You're Santa's reindeer?

56:10.850 --> 56:12.160
- Oh, cool.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.030
Can we feed them now mama?

56:14.030 --> 56:15.770
- No kids, behave.

56:15.770 --> 56:18.460
I'm Stella, an old friend of Santa's.

56:18.460 --> 56:21.300
And this is my daughter
Zoey, and my boy Fip.

56:21.300 --> 56:22.720
- I'm Tinker.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.250
- And I'm Perry.

56:24.250 --> 56:26.120
- We're looking for Santa.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.500
Have you seen him?

56:27.500 --> 56:30.710
- A search party is out
looking for Santa as we speak.

56:30.710 --> 56:32.110
- A search party?

56:32.110 --> 56:35.300
- Yes, a kind tunder fungus.

56:35.300 --> 56:36.950
- Our friend Sprout.

56:36.950 --> 56:38.640
- And Santa's elf, Benny.

56:38.640 --> 56:39.683
- Benny's okay?

56:40.700 --> 56:42.160
- He's okay.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.490
- What about Santa?

56:43.490 --> 56:46.040
- Santa fell victim to an evil spell

56:46.040 --> 56:49.340
and he vanished before our very eyes.

56:49.340 --> 56:50.740
- Oh no!

56:50.740 --> 56:54.110
- Do you mind showing us which
way the search party went?

56:54.110 --> 56:55.580
- They went that way.

56:55.580 --> 56:57.960
- That's right, they have
a little head start on you

56:57.960 --> 56:59.700
but you should be able to catch up.

56:59.700 --> 57:01.650
- Thanks for your help.

57:01.650 --> 57:04.663
Come on Perry, we have a Santa to rescue.

57:07.060 --> 57:07.893
- Clank.

57:10.220 --> 57:12.960
I believe I may have error.

57:12.960 --> 57:13.793
- Oh?

57:13.793 --> 57:18.403
Have you decided to grant me
Christmas controL after all?

57:19.630 --> 57:20.680
- Ha!

57:20.680 --> 57:22.000
Don't be silly.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.860
I'm talking about that reindeer Larry.

57:24.860 --> 57:28.320
I thought his natural
foolishness will

57:28.320 --> 57:32.123
and make them despise
all things of Christmas.

57:33.180 --> 57:37.470
But now, I fear the opposite may occur.

57:37.470 --> 57:40.440
His stupidity may actually be endearing

57:41.780 --> 57:43.530
and we can't have that.

57:43.530 --> 57:46.160
- No, we cannot.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.620
I concur.

57:47.620 --> 57:50.230
What are you gonna do about it master?

57:50.230 --> 57:55.230
- I'm gonna use a mad magic
to take over that deer's mind.

57:56.400 --> 58:00.193
And turn him evil.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.310
Like us.

58:02.310 --> 58:06.477
- Wow, how utterly villainess of you.

58:08.110 --> 58:10.490
- I know right?

58:10.490 --> 58:13.090
I'll work Larry like a puppet.

58:13.090 --> 58:15.900
With the ridiculously crazy behavior

58:15.900 --> 58:18.337
that no one could possibly.

58:19.500 --> 58:23.010
By the time I'm done, everybody

58:23.010 --> 58:28.010
will absolutely hate
Christmas.

58:31.573 --> 58:33.930
- Sowen, our plan might've backfired,

58:33.930 --> 58:36.010
now Mighty's more gang holed than ever

58:36.010 --> 58:37.480
to ruin Christmas.

58:37.480 --> 58:40.060
We have to warn the others
about Mighty's new plan.

58:40.060 --> 58:41.970
We need to leave right now.

58:41.970 --> 58:44.380
- I agree, do you have
everything you need?

58:44.380 --> 58:45.550
- Are you coming?

58:45.550 --> 58:46.960
- Yes, of course.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.350
- Then I have everything I need.

58:49.350 --> 58:50.183
- Oh.

58:53.570 --> 58:55.530
- They think they'll save Christmas today.

58:55.530 --> 58:56.393
I'll show them.

58:57.690 --> 58:59.440
I'll just show them all.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.403
Just wait till I get a load of me.

59:10.450 --> 59:12.743
- Hi, we're from the North Pole.

59:13.620 --> 59:15.950
- Whoa, Christmas deer.

59:15.950 --> 59:17.900
- And we're looking for--
- Santa?

59:17.900 --> 59:19.340
You just missed him.

59:19.340 --> 59:20.490
- We did?

59:20.490 --> 59:22.920
- Yup, my pop rescued him.

59:22.920 --> 59:24.345
- He did?

59:24.345 --> 59:26.470
- Snag's exaggerating.

59:26.470 --> 59:29.410
I merely did a favor for an old friend.

59:29.410 --> 59:31.210
- Which way did he go?

59:31.210 --> 59:35.080
- He went that way with an
elf and a little fungus.

59:35.080 --> 59:37.820
- Santa's going back to the North Pole.

59:37.820 --> 59:39.710
- Let's hurry up and get back home too.

59:39.710 --> 59:41.930
- I'll see you guys next year.

59:41.930 --> 59:43.553
Santa hired me!

59:46.314 --> 59:50.350
- Ho ho ho ho, it's good to be home.

59:50.350 --> 59:53.506
- Santa, you're back!

59:53.506 --> 59:55.047
- I am, indeed.

59:55.047 --> 59:58.620
Thanks to the quick thinking
of all my good friends.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.633
- Speaking of friends,
where's Tinker and Perry?

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.850
- They went looking for Santa.

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:07.350
- Oh no!

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.494
Now we must go looking for them.

01:00:09.494 --> 01:00:11.713
- Calm yourselves down.

01:00:11.713 --> 01:00:15.050
We're talking about Tinker and Perry.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.670
Two of the mightiest reindeer
of all the North Pole.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.430
They'll be fine.

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:23.850
- They will?
- Of course!

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:28.710
What I'm concerned about
now is where is Larry

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:32.483
and what is this business about
him taking over Christmas.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.090
- At last, we're home.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:38.200
Let's find Santa.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.950
- I wonder if he's already found out

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:42.050
Larry moved into his house.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:44.320
- And he's trying to change Christmas.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.993
- Hey, speaking of Larry.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.020
- Gabble dee gabble dee, slippery slip.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.900
Pine cords and acorns
in your Christmas soup.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.070
- Larry, where did you come from?

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.430
- And when did you start
rhyming like a weirdo?

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.340
- I've always loved rhymes
and puzzles and riddles,

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.020
will Christmas burn while
the reindeer fiddles?

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:12.030
- Okay, now you sound downright bonkers.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.080
- Mad as a header.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.440
- Tick Tock Tock boys,
the clocks are ticking.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.370
It's almost Christmas eve.

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:22.083
What gift will you be picking?

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:25.360
- Let's find Santa at once.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.530
- Yeah, not a minute to waste.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:28.863
This deer's gone bad.

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:33.780
- Santa, only you can
stop the Mighty Bunion

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.610
from ruining Christmas.

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:39.140
- Or the Mighty Bunion
who dwells inside Larry.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.600
- Oh, what a mess.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.470
- Santa, what shall we do?

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:46.320
- Dark magic is afoot.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.390
And there's no time to return to ask help

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:51.000
of Bart the dragon.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.210
We must act at once.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.530
Wait, where's Benny?

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:59.500
- And now, using powerful magic spells,

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.090
I shall destroy Christmas
once and for all.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.830
- Wait!
- What?

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.147
What do you think you're doing elf?

01:02:09.147 --> 01:02:11.925
- I'm just an elf, I know.

01:02:11.925 --> 01:02:16.310
And a new elf at that, but
I believe in our job here.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:18.560
And I believe in the North Pole.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.797
And I believe in Christmas.

01:02:19.797 --> 01:02:22.013
And I believe in you Larry!

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.420
- Silly gnome.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.300
- Christmas should a holiday
of cheer and gratitude

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.950
and love and family.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.800
Not of gloom and doom.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.110
And I know that deep
down, you agree with me.

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:39.010
- Nope, I disagree, so sue me.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:42.790
- Look, I know we can't
all get along all the time.

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.880
But some things are universal.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.160
A smile, a wave.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:52.160
A pat on the back, a
hug, a Merry Christmas.

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:53.720
Can we just agree on that?

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.670
That the spirit of Christmas lives in each

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.010
and everyone of us and binds us altogether

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.460
in the North Pole?

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.003
Or wherever.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.600
- I find it hard to argue with that.

01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:10.120
- I'm losing power over
that goofy reindeer.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.880
That gnome is making way too much sense.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.430
Wiggly Clank, go get
some salamander breath

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:20.710
so I make some more magical potion.

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.070
- No.
- What did you just say?

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:26.800
- I said no, Bunion.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.633
- Bunion?

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.670
You don't call me a Bunion.

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:32.220
We've been over this.

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.873
You call me master.

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:37.917
- Not anymore, Bunion.

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.880
I've done everything you've ever asked.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.710
Polished your shoes, built
a kingdom brick my brick,

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:51.363
breached castles, defeated enemies.

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.363
For what?

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.173
To be ignored and disregarded
time and time again.

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:01.483
- Ignored?

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:05.460
Well, all right.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:06.960
What do you want?

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.160
Name it, it's yours.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.793
You want Christmas?

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.360
Done, it's yours.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.580
Do you hear me?

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.723
It's yours.

01:04:16.723 --> 01:04:19.430
- That's too late, Bunion.

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:24.430
What else made all the
sense in the world to me.

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:29.330
I now see the error of my ways.

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:32.730
And I'm not on your side anymore.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:34.070
- Not on my...

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:38.810
But I created you.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:43.070
You're my supernatural, magical sidekick.

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:45.810
You cannot turn your back on me.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:48.320
I will stop you.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.140
- Just try it.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:54.490
- Very well, have it your way.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:58.050
Rusty bogs and squeaky joints.

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.210
Downward bound your needle points.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:04.740
Molten steel and scrap iron heap.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:09.740
What you sow, you will now reap.

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:12.720
- Meryy Christmas Bunion.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.860
- What?

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.693
No! No!

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.500
- Your spell's reversed.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.863
The Christmas spirit is stronger than you.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.465
Always, has been.

01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:28.048
And always will be.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:34.220
You're doomed Bunion and
Christmas is free from your grasp.

01:05:37.098 --> 01:05:38.681
Noooooo!

01:05:52.855 --> 01:05:54.670
- Hi Benny, what's going on?

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:57.070
- Larry, you're back!

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.030
- Back from where?

01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:59.550
Was I sleepwalking again?

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.110
- Oh, Larry, it's you all right.

01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:04.620
So glad to have you back.

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:05.453
- What?

01:06:05.453 --> 01:06:06.320
What did I miss?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.490
Oh, I didn't miss Christmas, didn't I?

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:09.908
Santa!

01:06:09.908 --> 01:06:11.650
There's Santa, hi Santa!

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:13.233
Where have you been?

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.950
- We'll talk about that later Larry.

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:22.570
I'm just happy you're Your old self again.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:26.740
- Terry, Perry, Tinker,
where have you guys been?

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.530
- More like where have you been Larry.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:30.500
- Me?

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.340
I think I've been sleepwalking again.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.303
- Ho ho ho ho.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.670
Our good old Larry is back.

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:40.290
Now it's time to get Christmas in gear.

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.311
What do you guys say?

01:06:42.311 --> 01:06:43.144
- Hooray!

01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:46.993
- Cool icicles.

01:07:01.968 --> 01:07:05.066
Well, well, well.

01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:08.315
That was a Christmas eve to remember guys.

01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:13.315
- Yeah, we delivered
all the gifts on time.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.160
- Without a hitch.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.110
- Great job, everybody.

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:20.290
- Santa?
- Yes, Larry?

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.460
- I want to apologize.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:26.400
I don't think I've been
sleepwalking at all.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.090
- Oh no?

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:30.430
- No, I remember everything now.

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:33.932
I've been a bad, bad reindeer.

01:07:33.932 --> 01:07:36.460
I've tried to take your place
and be in charge of Christmas.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.670
Will you ever forgive me?

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.420
- Larry?
- Yes, Santa?

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.560
- I will forgive you.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.970
You are after all, my favorite reindeer.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:48.260
- I am?

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.950
See, I told you guys!

01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:51.250
I'm Santa's favorite.

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.740
- Yes, you are a slowpoke, Larry.

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:58.610
You have a quirky limp and
you ask for a bathroom break

01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:01.590
about every two miles

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:05.350
which makes you absolutely adorable.

01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:07.887
I just can't stay mad at you.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:09.921
- Oh.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.530
- Look at the bright side, Larry.

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:16.830
No matter what, you can do
no wrong in Santa's eyes.

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.160
- Yeah, unconditional
love is the most amazing

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.770
thing to have.

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:26.770
- And Santa's unconditional
love is the most special of all.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.712
- I guess so.

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.979
- You're forgiven Larry.

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:34.689
So what do you say?

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:37.899
Are you happy to be
Santa's special reindeer?

01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:38.970
- Yes Santa.

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.390
- Limp, bathroom breaks and all?

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:43.380
- Oh yes, Santa, all of it.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:46.560
- Do you still wanna run Christmas?

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.533
- No way!
- Oh yeah?

01:08:49.533 --> 01:08:51.069
And why not?

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:52.331
- Oh Santa.

01:08:52.331 --> 01:08:55.250
I've tried to come up with
new and innovative ways

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:58.390
to celebrate Christmas,
and nothing was as amazing

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.493
as the way we've been doing it forever.

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:02.903
Christmas the way it is.

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:05.368
It's the best.

01:09:05.368 --> 01:09:07.319
- Ho ho ho ho, good to hear that Larry.

01:09:10.205 --> 01:09:14.359
- Oh Santa, being your favorite
reindeer is the greatest

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.783
Christmas gift of all.

01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:18.173
Thank you Santa.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.773
And Merry Christmas.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.960
- Merry Christmas to you too, Larry.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.763
And Merry Christmas to all.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.710
- Merry Christmas everybody.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.689
Merry Christmas.

01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:36.613
Merry Christmas.

01:09:41.884 --> 01:09:43.950
- I'll be back.

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:46.279
This is far from over.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.700
You wretched, all eyes
haven't seen the last

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.660
of the Might Bunion.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:56.660
Our return's stronger, scarier, mightier!

01:09:58.243 --> 01:10:02.050
And I'll step out your
stupid Christmas cheer

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:03.593
off of your face.

01:10:05.447 --> 01:10:07.343
- Ah, shut up.

01:10:09.906 --> 01:10:11.961
- How dare you!

01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:14.500
- And by the way, I quit.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:17.503
- What?

01:10:19.385 --> 01:10:21.856
Where are you going?

01:10:21.856 --> 01:10:26.856
- I'm going to the North Pole
to be a Christmas helper.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.207
Good riddance you old keep.
