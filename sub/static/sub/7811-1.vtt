<i>Man. You're still here?
I thought I was too late.</i>

01:09.969 --> 01:12.108
Too late for your birthday party?

01:12.639 --> 01:15.176
You blue-lined, man.
They're coming.

01:15.675 --> 01:16.779
No.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.447
<i>Look, I just found out, man. I'm sorry.</i>

01:19.679 --> 01:22.558
Listen, if we don't get to speak again,
I just want to let you know

01:22.649 --> 01:24.720
that I think what you've
been doing is noble.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.320
Crazy, but brave.

01:26.386 --> 01:27.797

<i>Good luck, brother.</i>

02:23.176 --> 02:24.280
Son of a bitch.

<i>Showing vehicles

03:28.741 --> 03:29.845
All right.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.684
Let's test their brakes then.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.972
Ahab, shut these guys down!

Hands up!

04:50.023 --> 04:51.866
Come on, not the bag.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.198
Come on now.

05:05.438 --> 05:08.044
Come on, guys.
I'm scared of the dark.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.352
How you doing?

05:18.284 --> 05:19.558
Holden.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.762
I thought you were retired.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.056
- Yeah, I was.
- Well, what the hell are you doing here?

05:26.292 --> 05:29.296
Well, I'm guessing that they liked me a lot

05:30.229 --> 05:33.802
and probably needed me,
just like you might need me.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.942
And why exactly do I need you?

05:36.035 --> 05:39.608
Well, that way, you can keep
from wearing your ass as a hat.

05:42.041 --> 05:45.579
Let's see. "Who is Blackjack?"

05:47.013 --> 05:48.390
Let us read.

05:49.215 --> 05:54.722
"A lone-wolf patriot waging
a one-man cyber-war against a-holes."

05:56.089 --> 05:58.865
Now, I've known you since you were 14.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.097
What is this crap?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.639
Have you seen my operating tempo?

06:02.729 --> 06:04.037
Three targets in a month.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.440
SOCOM is not amused.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.135
So, they're arresting me?

06:08.067 --> 06:09.307
That's brilliant.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.211
They should be pinning a medal to my chest.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.551
I wanted to pin
a waterboard on your back, Drew.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.818
I'm sorry.
Are you Holden's new bitch?

06:16.909 --> 06:18.946
You think this is funny?
Some kind of a joke?

06:19.078 --> 06:21.217
No. Not at all, Agent Dolce.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.322
Is Agent Gabbana close by?

06:23.416 --> 06:26.625
Chicago's pitch black, Drew,
200,000 out of power.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.466
Someone changed
the operating cycle on the generator,

06:29.555 --> 06:31.228
causing it to go out of control.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.600
We don't fix this in six hours,
the plant will have

06:33.659 --> 06:36.105
irreversible damage, you understand?

06:36.162 --> 06:37.903
Chicago will be pitch black for weeks.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.274
Schools, hospitals, police stations.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.505
- You get it?
- Okay, yeah.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.121
So, what does this have to do with me?

06:43.169 --> 06:45.740
Cyber-attacks. Someone hacked the plant.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.785
And this is your new golden boy?

06:47.840 --> 06:48.978
They can't hack that kind of thing.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.645
This has to be an implant.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.916
He's right. It's an implant.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.425
Do you happen to recognize it?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.464
- That's Pantheon.
- I see.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.831
Up till a few hours ago,
we thought it was you.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.083
No, this is impossible.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.162
You can't use Pantheon
without the encryption key.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.533
You lost the key?

07:12.632 --> 07:15.044
- You created it. You can stop it.
- No.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.704
No, no, I can't.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.044
That's the whole point. You need the key.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.549
If you have it, you control the implant.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.880
If you don't, some jihadi prick

07:21.941 --> 07:23.511
- gets to rule the world.
- All right, listen.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.986
What's our next course of action?

07:25.044 --> 07:26.523
Stop shaving and learn Arabic.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.024
Now, listen.
Let me ask you something.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.220
And I want an honest answer.

07:31.317 --> 07:35.322
This is really important
to me and it's even more important to you.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.966
- Did you put in a back-door?
- No.

07:39.025 --> 07:42.700
No, if I'd put in a back-door, that would've
been illegal and I would've gone to jail.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.502
You're going to jail anyway.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.578
If there were a back-door, and I'm not
saying that there is because there isn't,

07:50.670 --> 07:55.210
but if there were, I would want a signed
immunity agreement before I revealed it.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.688
Holy shit,
you really lost the key?

08:00.746 --> 08:02.666
I thought you were bluffing
to get the back-door.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.159
This is really bad, you guys.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.857
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen?

08:09.689 --> 08:11.259
Yeah, there's a back-door.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.735
Just uncuff me so that I can use it.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.913
<i>"REPORTER".
With the entire city left in the dark,</i>

08:23.002 --> 08:25.744
<i>it may have been a cyber-attack.</i>

08:25.938 --> 08:27.849
I could double the speed.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.046
Destroy it right now if you want.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.350
Bring Chicago to its knees.

08:32.745 --> 08:37.751
<i>Crews now scrambling to figure out
what caused the massive power outage.</i>

08:37.850 --> 08:39.886
<i>Police are on tactical alert</i>

08:40.019 --> 08:42.966
<i>as the fear and violence
is starting to grow.</i>

08:44.023 --> 08:45.559
I doubted you.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.703
But this is going to make you a rich boy.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.809
We appreciate your interest.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.544
Start the bidding at 10 million.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.127
What?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.232
Great, so I'll tell him.

09:18.457 --> 09:19.561
Thank you.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.798
Everyone, problem's over.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.500
Power will be on in five minutes.
No damage.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.772
- All right.
- Good job.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.316
Way to go, kid.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.912
What are you talking about?

09:38.978 --> 09:41.083
That back-door crap. It worked.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.649
- I didn't do anything.
- What?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.455
I was locked out.
I was locked out.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.157
Whoever stole the key patched the...

09:48.454 --> 09:49.990
Patched the back-door.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.295
They're good.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.530
They're leagues better than
anyone you have working at SOCOM.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.196
I've been scrambling to
find another way in,

09:55.294 --> 09:59.606
but without the encrypted key,
there's nothing I can do.

09:59.665 --> 10:00.871
What are you saying?

10:00.967 --> 10:05.211
I'm saying that whoever has Pantheon
turned it off themselves. Not me.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.046
Wait a minute.
Why would they do that?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.854
That was a test run.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.858
They're showing what Pantheon can do.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.195
<i>Pantheon is an implant.</i>

10:26.459 --> 10:28.700
An implant is like a worm,

10:28.794 --> 10:31.468
only with a PhD and a nuke
strapped to its back.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.144
We introduce it to a network
and it propagates from there.

10:35.201 --> 10:39.650
Once it's in place, it lays dormant,
waiting for a signal to wake it up

10:39.705 --> 10:41.707
and then it wreaks havoc.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.050
It's more dangerous
than a standing army or a dozen nukes.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.717
All you need to control it
is the encrypted data key.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.318
It's a physical key, it's one of
a kind, it cannot be duplicated.

10:52.385 --> 10:57.334
The code changes every ten-millionth
of a second in sync with the implant,

10:57.390 --> 11:02.396
so if you copy the key,
it falls out of sync, you lose control.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.606
It's been spreading since 2008.

11:05.564 --> 11:08.044
So, coverage at this point
is probably around 80%.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.040
Of what?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.113
The world.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.720
<i>Every terrorist group
and hostile government in the world</i>

11:18.778 --> 11:21.418
<i>is gonna try to get
their hands on the Pantheon key.</i>

11:21.714 --> 11:25.218
And if they do, they'll have the
power to blackout any city,

11:25.284 --> 11:29.790
derail any train, melt down any
power plant, all from a laptop,

11:29.889 --> 11:31.698
<i>with just a few lines of code.</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:40.109
<i>The fact that the hackers
who stole this didn't blow up Chicago</i>

11:40.299 --> 11:44.111
<i>tells me he's coin-operated, and that
blanking out the city was just a demo.</i>

11:44.737 --> 11:47.081
<i>So that he can sell it
to the highest bidder.</i>

11:58.117 --> 12:03.066
You want to nuke Tokyo, flood Rio,
burn Moscow or London, this is your guy.

12:03.289 --> 12:07.499
Whatever we do, we have to track him down
and find him before he sells that key.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.802
Okay, then.

12:09.895 --> 12:14.139
Drew, here, will be a member of a team
that Agent Connelly is putting together

12:14.233 --> 12:17.077
and I want you to know we're gonna put
everything we've got out there

12:17.136 --> 12:18.843
to stop this thing, okay?

12:18.938 --> 12:19.973
So, thanks.

12:27.613 --> 12:31.755
Sir, with all due respect, he can't be trusted
and we don't need a geek in the field.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.991
All due respect,
all you need is me in the field, okay?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.434
This is not a team operation.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.867
That's why I left SOCOM
in the first place. I work alone.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.372
I really don't remember
asking either one of you for your opinion.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.170
So, shut the hell up, okay?

12:46.332 --> 12:49.677
Now, you will lead and,
Drew, you will follow.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.476
<i>Adios.</i>

12:52.972 --> 12:54.451
Thank you, sir.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.482
- You don't want me on a team.
- What?

13:00.546 --> 13:02.287
You don't want me on a team.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.453
I don't play well with others, okay?

13:04.517 --> 13:05.996
You know that about me.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.531
I mean, people are fine
in the abstract, but up close and personal,

13:08.621 --> 13:09.793
they're the worst.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.459
I know that. I mean, I understand.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.367
I know you're very
comfortable hiding in your trailer,

13:13.459 --> 13:15.530
playing with your little toys.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.972
See, but those days are kind of over.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.067
So, you got two options.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.041
A, you can take that
wonderful talent you have

13:23.135 --> 13:26.878
and let it rot in a cell
for 30 to 50 years,

13:27.239 --> 13:30.379
or, B, be a man and be useful, okay?

13:30.676 --> 13:31.916
You said I'd have immunity.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.684
This is Eastern Europe.
I don't need to charge you.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.249
I've got three black sites
within an hour's drive of here.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.592
I'm not going back.

13:41.587 --> 13:42.759
Drew.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.730
This is your code.

13:46.025 --> 13:49.996
There are millions, millions of people
whose lives are at stake.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.269
And if I'm going to stop it, I need you.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.102
I know it's going to be
really, really dangerous.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.545
I mean, horror of all horrors,

13:57.670 --> 14:00.173
you are going to have to
deal with real people.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.617
Fine.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.754
But I get to choose the rest of the team.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.724
Because if Tom Slick chooses the team,

14:09.782 --> 14:12.262
I'm gonna be surrounded by frat boys

14:12.351 --> 14:13.991
with firm handshakes and five-year plans.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.693
Fine, I'll get you the dossiers
on 20 of our top agents, and you pick.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.632
I don't want your dossiers,
I can hack your personnel files.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.601
- And I sure as shit don't want your top 20.
- Why, why, why?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.196
Because it's full
of fast-trackers and yes-men, okay?

14:23.262 --> 14:24.764
No, I've got an algorithm.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.437
It will choose the best
team scientifically.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.613
<i>You picked these guys?</i>

14:39.712 --> 14:42.625
They're throwaways,
they're finished, washed up.

14:42.948 --> 14:46.054
I mean, maybe they'll use
them for suicide missions.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.064
The numbers don't lie.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.889
This job, these are the best people.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.400
Have you read their files?

14:51.457 --> 14:52.800
Yeah, I glanced at them.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.570
Dan Fisher.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.576
<i>He managed to roid-rage his way
into blowing every one of his missions.</i>

14:59.665 --> 15:03.010
He was kicked back to making copies
in the embassy sub-basement.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.790
<i>- Amalgamated vending.</i>
- Yes.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.359
Machine number zero, eight, nine, six...

15:26.458 --> 15:28.096
<i>Thank you for calling with your concern.</i>

15:28.427 --> 15:30.668
<i>All of our operators are busy right now.</i>

15:30.763 --> 15:33.710
<i>Estimated hold time is 47 minutes.</i>

15:46.045 --> 15:50.323
<i>All you have to do is insert the
change, press the button then, wow,</i>

15:50.382 --> 15:51.986
<i>fresh snacks.</i>

15:55.654 --> 15:57.190
Hello!

16:02.461 --> 16:03.838
Gloria Miller.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.376
Swallow.

16:12.571 --> 16:13.743
Come on, don't call her that.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.182
- What's a swallow?
- He's right.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.220
It's just a disgusting term
the KGB used to use.

16:18.544 --> 16:24.426
She's actually an agent who uses
special weapons to get intelligence.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.219
Special weapons?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.791
Another happy customer, Miller?

17:01.353 --> 17:02.525
Screw you, Langstrom.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.528
Listen, I got a lead from him on Ukraine.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.094
An FSB operative
is coming in from Moscow tomorrow night.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.933
- And maybe I could intercept...
- We can take it from here.

17:31.483 --> 17:32.928
Dmitri Stanislov.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.734
Former KGB.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.271
He speaks Russian.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.126
Yeah. According to
his S.O., he's not good for anything else.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.173
You.

17:51.937 --> 17:53.348
You commie.

17:54.573 --> 17:58.612
He was on that failed Ukrainian
Ministry Building run last month.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.025
You left me.

18:05.284 --> 18:09.027
I got cavity searched
in a Ukraine prison because of you.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.832
Fuck.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.197
Dmitri!

18:17.830 --> 18:19.832
No, because of you.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.275
You were late.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.475
Dmitri, get back here!

18:26.438 --> 18:29.009
<i>You blew the mission, not me.</i>

18:29.208 --> 18:30.778
Because of me?

18:30.843 --> 18:33.687
Okay, no, guys, guys.
You need to settle down.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.623
Well, you picked them. Go brief them.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.357
I said, get up and go fucking brief them.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.973
I ought to kill you right here.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.508
Come on.

18:52.831 --> 18:52.997
You left me! I want an apology!

18:52.998 --> 18:55.308
You left me! I want an apology!

18:55.367 --> 18:56.812
You were late.

18:56.869 --> 18:57.973
Hey!

19:01.373 --> 19:02.477
Hi.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.590
I see you've been acquainted.

19:07.679 --> 19:12.253
Yeah, so, thank you
for coming on such short notice.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.728
Who the hell are you?

19:15.187 --> 19:16.860
I'm... I'm Drew.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.530
Are you intelligence or an intern?

19:20.692 --> 19:23.571
I'm, just... I'm, you know, just me.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.707
A private contractor of sorts.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.540
What do you do exactly?

19:30.702 --> 19:32.545
Well, that's difficult
to describe, you know.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.881
I'm probably best known for CVE-2010-1807.

19:37.709 --> 19:42.055
But, you know, my passion is for Boolean
operations and complex adaptive systems.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.588
- So, you know, it's natural that...
- Drew!

19:44.683 --> 19:47.391
Christ's sakes, show 'em, will ya?
Just show 'em!

19:50.923 --> 19:53.096
So, I'm just gonna show you guys.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.996
Name someone you actively dislike.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.399
Christopher F. Langstrom.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.746
For someone with his clearance,
that was embarrassingly easy.

20:05.237 --> 20:10.016
Current tax return has him living
on Glen View Terrace in Herndon, Virginia.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.453
It turns out you were correct.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.081
He is a world-class douche bag,
he was actually

20:15.347 --> 20:18.226
diagnosed with Narcissistic
Personality Disorder.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.219
How did you get his password so quickly?

20:21.253 --> 20:23.290
Well, he uses
an NSA type 2 encryption,

20:23.388 --> 20:26.892
which he thinks is safe,
but, really, there's a known vulnerability.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.319
And he's e-mailed himself
all his passwords,

20:29.394 --> 20:31.834
so if you guys want to drain
his bank account, we can do that.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.804
What else can you do?

20:37.302 --> 20:41.250
We could turn his phone
into a listening device,

20:42.207 --> 20:44.278
or a live camera feed.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.722
Look, now I have his real-time location,

20:47.546 --> 20:50.254
and control over his vehicle.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.589
Three lines of code
and I could send his car into a brick wall.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.097
So, what do you guys think?

20:56.054 --> 20:57.931
Should we kill this fucker?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.901
Yeah? Murder, anyone?

21:01.493 --> 21:04.235
Tell you what. Let's see the system.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.307
Looks like he's got another Gmail account.

21:06.398 --> 21:10.744
This one he uses for numerous affairs
with female staffers.

21:10.802 --> 21:11.940
She's cute.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.678
So, what do you think?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.274
You want him divorced or fired?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.648
I'm tempted.

21:20.746 --> 21:24.023
Yeah, you don't have to raise your... Yes?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.528
I will do mission on one condition.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.123
You never go in my mail, okay?

21:30.789 --> 21:33.668
Because sometimes
I have e-mailed pictures that are jokes.

21:34.426 --> 21:41.036
Not photos that turn me on, photos that
turn very strange people on, understand?

21:46.938 --> 21:50.010
I'm driving this crap of junk?

21:50.208 --> 21:52.381
It's for surveillance, not for racing.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.820
Pick one.

21:55.614 --> 21:56.820
Go in.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.624
I'm good. Shotgun.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.223
No, I have pistol.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.165
No, I mean, I
called the front seat.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.327
Speaking of shotguns,
where's the heavy weapons?

22:07.392 --> 22:09.804
Can't I at least get an FIM-92?

22:09.961 --> 22:11.065
A what?

22:11.697 --> 22:13.734
A bazooka, man. A bazooka.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.639
You're not getting a goddamn bazooka.

22:16.702 --> 22:19.308
Would you rather be
the guy who has one and doesn't need it,

22:19.371 --> 22:22.215
or the guy who needs one
but doesn't have it?

22:22.741 --> 22:24.880
You're giving me a headache. Get in.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.215
You should at least
give me some grenades, man.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.021
No, no, no.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.257
Put it down, put it down.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.027
Not for geeks, it's for agents, okay?

22:37.155 --> 22:39.032
It's none of your business.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.061
Sir, are you sure about this?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.230
No.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.086
I can't find the Pantheon key,

22:59.177 --> 23:02.454
but the code did give me
a line on who patched the back-door.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.692
I've got no name or photo,
but I was able to track the IP address

23:05.751 --> 23:07.890
of whoever patched
the back-door to this location.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.737
This is a skinhead bar.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.864
Great. Any chance we get, let's mix it up.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.135
- Excuse me?
- These guys are nee-Nazis, right?

23:19.431 --> 23:21.741
It'd be a shame to come
all this way and not bust a couple heads.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.972
Fisher, stop it.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.981
I just need to tap into the guy's computer
and get some information, that's it.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.607
Yeah, Fisher. Low-profile, okay?

23:27.706 --> 23:29.947
No bazookas,
no fist fighting, you understand?

23:30.041 --> 23:32.453
You stay in the van.
Dmitri, come back me up.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.317
Impossible.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.253
What is he saying?

23:38.316 --> 23:41.297
I am one twelfth Jewish
on my mother's side.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.730
These guys will kill me.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.962
English. Hey, English, okay?

23:46.958 --> 23:49.461
I drive. Ls better.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.173
I am driver.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.436
Pussy.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.603
Listen, I'll go in. But I should go alone.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.147
Right. I mean,
how much tactical experience do you have?

23:58.303 --> 24:00.579
I speak hacker. I can talk to them.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.016
Right, well, that's why I'm getting wired,

24:02.107 --> 24:05.067
so you can stay in the van with the girl
here and translate the geek-speak.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.484
Sorry.

24:07.579 --> 24:08.649
I had to reposition it.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.250
Listen, it's not as easy
as just feeding you the lingo, okay?

24:11.316 --> 24:12.522
If I go in...

24:12.617 --> 24:13.925
Look, look. I go in alone.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.760
You stay here with the
rest of the dropouts.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.095
What about me?

24:17.155 --> 24:19.157
You know, I could help.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.534
Um, there's no use
for your skill set on this mission,

24:22.627 --> 24:25.005
- but you keep it warm and we'll find...
- Test, test, test.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.338
Do you wanna wait till I go outside?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.141
I'm just testing the equipment.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.546
It's great.

24:33.438 --> 24:34.883
Here you go.

25:27.392 --> 25:29.668
All right,
there's four assholes in here with laptops.

25:29.728 --> 25:31.207
What does he look like?

25:31.563 --> 25:36.569
Shaved head,
black clothes, puke-white skin.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.772
Screw you, Drew.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.339
Hey, Dmitri, how's your Bulgarian?

25:42.874 --> 25:46.845
Good enough for government work...

25:48.847 --> 25:52.021
and playing around with...

25:52.083 --> 25:53.619
prostitutes.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.924
That's good. I don't know what you said.

25:58.623 --> 25:59.795
Yeah.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.932
I need you to reply to this post, okay.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.474
This guy is a huge Levski football fan.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.770
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:06.865 --> 26:10.904
So, why don't you say, "lvo will be
lucky to score three goals this season."

26:10.969 --> 26:12.778
"He's barely League One material."

26:14.539 --> 26:16.541
lvo is their best player.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.383
He will score 20...

26:18.443 --> 26:19.922
I'm sure he's really, really good.

26:19.978 --> 26:21.082
- Best, best.
- Yeah.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.146
Could you just write down
exactly what I just said?

26:23.148 --> 26:24.422
.Okay-.Okay-

26:24.616 --> 26:27.290
- My typing is for shit.
- Okay, that's all right.

26:32.657 --> 26:33.795
Wow.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.139
You're literally
killing me right now.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.849
This isn't working.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.612
You need to go faster than this.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.015
All right, any day now.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.646
<i>All right, pissing him off,</i>

26:53.845 --> 26:57.657
pissing him off in three, two, one.

27:01.519 --> 27:03.521
All right, I got him. I'm headed in.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.262
Wait, wait, you can't just head in, okay.
I haven't briefed you.

27:06.324 --> 27:09.999
These Bulgarian hackers
specialize in anti-virtualization.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.696
<i>Relax, I'll put this thing in the thing.</i>

27:11.763 --> 27:14.334
<i>I don't know why you geeks
gotta complicate everything.</i>

27:16.601 --> 27:18.012
Three vodkas.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.051
Stop him!

28:05.850 --> 28:07.090
Take it easy.

28:07.385 --> 28:08.693
Hey, Drew, they made me.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.891
- I warned you.
- Okay, we'll leave now.

28:11.823 --> 28:14.326
Sit down, you yellow commie bastard!

28:14.392 --> 28:15.564
I'm going in.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.071
Fisher, sit down.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.082
Everyone, just calm down!
Jesus, you're children.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.938
Hey, take it easy.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.410
All right.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.105
Ease off, guys.

28:25.603 --> 28:27.674
Connelly, if you want to live,

28:27.739 --> 28:31.209
repeat every word Dmitri says right now,
phonetically, okay?

28:31.910 --> 28:33.287
All right.

28:34.946 --> 28:38.553
Reading Bulgarian, okay,
but speaking, very different.

28:38.616 --> 28:39.788
I don't recommend?

28:39.884 --> 28:42.763
Dmitri, listen to me.
You're all I've got, okay.

28:42.854 --> 28:46.131
So, you need to translate
this for me right now, okay.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.570
Take, here.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.639
You passed the test!

28:54.632 --> 28:58.136
On that SD card there are
120,000 credit card accounts.

28:58.303 --> 28:59.823
I'll sell them to you for 5,000 euros.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.249
I accept your offer of 5,000...

29:02.741 --> 29:06.086
and I will sell you
back your life for 5,000.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.154
- I'm going in.
- Fisher!

29:08.446 --> 29:10.289
Fisher, where the hell are you going?

29:10.381 --> 29:13.055
Are you gonna let
these anti-Semite pieces of shit win?

29:13.118 --> 29:14.563
No way!

29:15.053 --> 29:16.259
Not me!

29:16.321 --> 29:17.561
Fisher, you don't need to go in there.

29:17.622 --> 29:19.966
The chip worked.
I can get them to let him go.

29:20.391 --> 29:21.893
Bazooka time.

29:32.003 --> 29:34.506
Hey, everyone.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.417
I have an announcement to make.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.024
Shalom, motherfuckers.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.372
We have to help them.

29:59.664 --> 30:01.302
No, "0. no, no."

30:13.278 --> 30:16.157
Dmitri! Not again.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.853
- No!
- What are you doing?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.880
Drew, get ready with the door.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.378
Go, go, go!

31:38.229 --> 31:39.367
Here.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.204
Yeah?

31:43.468 --> 31:45.379
Slow down.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.607
<i>- Was it random?</i>
- What do <i>you mean?</i>

31:48.439 --> 31:51.545
Was it just a robbery,
or were you targeted?

31:52.477 --> 31:55.151
I can't say, but they were American.

31:55.313 --> 31:57.054
Was everything encrypted?

31:57.115 --> 31:58.719
<i>Yes. Of course.</i>

31:59.550 --> 32:03.930
That's good. You did everything right then.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.298
<i>Go back inside and don't worry.</i>

32:06.391 --> 32:07.631
Shit happens.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.295
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

32:29.847 --> 32:32.623
I got bit by a chubby, goulash-scented Nazi

32:32.684 --> 32:34.960
because Fisher here
was born with an extra pair

32:35.019 --> 32:37.522
of testicles instead of a brain.

32:37.822 --> 32:39.768
- Wasn't goulash.
- What?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.165
Goulash is Hungarian.

32:42.260 --> 32:47.608
The Nazi that bit you
most likely smelled like chlopski posilek.

32:47.765 --> 32:49.938
- You don't get to speak. You ran.
- What?

32:50.802 --> 32:52.543
I was not running.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.675
I was going to lead them away
and then move back around.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.115
Fisher!

33:07.618 --> 33:08.979
Holden is looking for you.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.903
I thought I could hide up here.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.867
What exactly are you hiding from?

33:28.706 --> 33:30.379
You don't...

33:31.576 --> 33:33.317
You don't remember me, do you?

33:34.645 --> 33:39.822
I had long hair and braces,
and I was 30 pounds heavier.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.056
I had a beard.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.332
Reston Skateway.

33:47.025 --> 33:51.838
The year was 2000.
I was playing Mortal Kombat.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.270
Mortal what?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.037
You don't know what Mortal Kombat is?

33:55.333 --> 33:56.403
No.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.544
It's a video game.

34:02.740 --> 34:06.347
Anyway, you were wearing
this tight red, um...

34:08.212 --> 34:10.317
It was like a half-shirt.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.522
And, you asked me about hacking.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.219
I told you everything.

34:15.319 --> 34:18.232
I even made some stuff up to impress you.

34:19.322 --> 34:21.735
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

34:29.033 --> 34:32.674
The Feds broke down my door a week later
and charged me with 30 felonies.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.774
So, thank you.
Thank you for not

34:34.871 --> 34:37.443
remembering ruining my life.

34:39.944 --> 34:42.083
What do you want?
Some kind of tearful apology?

34:42.179 --> 34:44.888
No, I just... I liked you.
And you said that you liked me.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.393
- And I know that was a long time ago...
- Wait. Is that why you picked me?

34:48.453 --> 34:50.295
You wanted some kind of revenge?

34:50.388 --> 34:52.299
- Is that it?
- No, I didn't want revenge.

34:52.389 --> 34:54.391
- No, no.
- Look, I don't remember you.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.910
I was a virgin.

35:07.638 --> 35:08.810
Yeah?

35:10.441 --> 35:12.614
Well, we were all virgins once.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.822
God, amen.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.795
Hey, Drew, you wanna tell me
what the hell we're doing here?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.728
The chip you put in
the laptop didn't tell us

36:28.819 --> 36:30.162
the location of the Pantheon key.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.723
But it did tell us who's selling it.

36:31.989 --> 36:35.630
His name is Teebs, he's a black hat hacker
who sells chaos to the highest bidder.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.703
So, we're here to take down this dweeb?

36:37.795 --> 36:39.832
- Kick his ass silly?
- No, no.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.137
Teebs is a ghost.
Nobody even knows his real name.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.679
We're looking for his broker.

36:43.968 --> 36:45.208
Broker?

36:45.836 --> 36:47.179
Why does he need broker?

36:47.238 --> 36:48.683
<i>Well,
when you're selling something ephemeral,</i>

36:48.739 --> 36:51.049
like a zero-day, or an encryption key,

36:51.142 --> 36:53.486
black-market buyers
want independent verification

36:53.544 --> 36:55.649
that what they're buying is legit.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.488
And the seller
wants to make sure that they get paid.

36:57.648 --> 36:58.991
So, they hire a third party.

36:59.183 --> 37:04.826
This broker verifies and vouches
for both parties and negotiates the terms.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.990
And what makes you think he's here?

37:06.991 --> 37:08.095
He's not.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.932
Not yet. But he will be.

37:10.027 --> 37:12.668
Every e-mail he sent Vitally
originated from the public Wi-Fi here.

37:12.763 --> 37:13.901
This is like his office.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.906
Yeah, well, he better hurry up,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.276
because the next person
who asks for a half-caf, no whip,

37:18.369 --> 37:19.541
I'm punching in the face.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.907
<i>No, Fisher. No punching.</i>

37:22.006 --> 37:24.748
<i>No fighting, no kicking, no biting.
Do you understand that?</i>

37:25.042 --> 37:27.022
We're just gonna tail this guy.
You got that?

37:27.078 --> 37:29.581
You and the geek stay
behind if it gets bad.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.182
Geek squad, you read that?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.209
<i>Yeah, my phone
will ping me when he fogs on.</i>

37:34.252 --> 37:36.061
My God, he's an asshole.

37:38.556 --> 37:40.866
Yeah, well, most of them are.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.609
So, you don't have a gun either?

37:46.697 --> 37:47.903
No.

37:49.033 --> 37:52.071
You know whatever's wrong with me
that makes me good at computers

37:52.136 --> 37:55.310
makes me especially shitty
at spatial tasking.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.744
What about you?

37:58.309 --> 38:00.789
I don't really need one with my skill set.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.887
That's bullshit. You know that, right?
That's nonsense.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.889
You saved all of our lives.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.562
Maybe they're too
proud to admit it, but I'm not.

38:14.091 --> 38:18.904
Well, maybe on the next mission they can
reward me by letting me wear pants.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.166
I'm freezing.

38:25.569 --> 38:26.946
Well, I...

38:27.905 --> 38:30.249
I was, smart this morning.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.784
And I have a layer.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.515
There you go.

38:38.416 --> 38:39.827
My God.

38:40.751 --> 38:43.357
I remember you from the skating rink now.

38:43.921 --> 38:46.197
You gave me your hoodie then, too.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.701
You insisted on driving me home.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.933
- You were sweet.
- I was stupid.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.634
- It was sweet.
- Nah.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.034
What happened to that guy?

38:58.002 --> 38:59.606
You happened to that guy.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.948
Hey, he's here. He logged in.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.888
Connelly. He's by you.

39:15.986 --> 39:17.488
The plaza.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.330
<i>A“ fight, Fisher, headed your way.</i>

39:24.962 --> 39:26.236
Got him.

39:28.165 --> 39:30.236
I guess he likes coffee.

39:33.337 --> 39:35.214
May I have a cappuccino, please?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.311
Make that a cappuccino.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.522
- All right, Miller, you're up.
- I'm up?

39:42.580 --> 39:43.923
<i>Do I need to spell it out?</i>

39:44.014 --> 39:46.094
Connelly, we don't
have to do it this way, all right.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.426
I'll approach him, I'll tell him I
have a zero-day exploit to sell.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.430
There's no time for that.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.996
Listen, you don't have to do this.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.232
I've done worse.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.732
Besides, we're saving the world, right?

40:05.603 --> 40:07.048
<i>Drew, relax, man.</i>

40:09.273 --> 40:11.378
By all means necessary.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.922
Sometimes you gotta take one for the team.

40:18.282 --> 40:20.421
Excuse me, is there anyone sitting here?

40:20.518 --> 40:22.964
- No one, go ahead.
- Thank you, you're very kind.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.300
It's really beautiful here.
Are you from here?

40:28.058 --> 40:29.537
No, I'm not.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.369
Really? Me, neither.
I'm American, what about you?

40:32.530 --> 40:34.134
Your coffee, sir.

40:34.465 --> 40:36.035
Thank you, love.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.709
He's a new guy.
Did you see his eyebrow?

40:42.473 --> 40:43.975
He's a bad boy.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.132
I'm sorry.
Could you just excuse me for a second?

40:53.617 --> 40:55.722
Wait. What? What happened?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.493
He's, not into me.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.501
But I think Fisher might be his type.

41:00.825 --> 41:03.271
<i>Hey, Fish.
Sometimes we gotta take one for the team.</i>

41:03.427 --> 41:05.464
By any means necessary, right?

41:06.664 --> 41:08.109
No way.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.510
Give him your number.
Ask him to lunch.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.181
Give him my number?
I ain't no swallow, okay.

41:14.572 --> 41:16.984
Male swallow is called "raven."

41:17.174 --> 41:19.176
I would have made a great one.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.410
Yeah, well,
I ain't doing it, so forget it.

41:21.779 --> 41:23.952
Too late. He's on the move.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.962
Okay, spread out,
but stay on him.

41:35.526 --> 41:37.369
Dmitri, he's headed your way.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.133
I see him.

42:01.385 --> 42:03.729
<i>Dmitri, stay on him.</i>

42:06.190 --> 42:08.693
Why would he pick Fisher over me?

42:09.293 --> 42:12.968
I am more manly. Better looking.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.139
Dmitri!

42:20.471 --> 42:22.314
Hey, hey. Don't get too close.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.910
I have a really strong signal,
I can track him anywhere.

42:25.476 --> 42:28.320
I know now why
he wanted Fisher and not me.

42:28.812 --> 42:30.689
He was looking for goalie.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.419
I am striker.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.225
<i>Dmitri! Where the hell is he?</i>

42:38.722 --> 42:40.998
Not too far. Just to subway.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.364
Lose that junk of crap and follow him!

42:43.427 --> 42:45.498
Drew said he had signal.

42:47.665 --> 42:48.939
<i>I got this guy.</i>

42:49.099 --> 42:51.045
<i>Keep a safe distance, but stay on him.</i>

42:51.268 --> 42:53.111
<i>Dmitri, you wanna get out of the car?</i>

42:53.370 --> 42:55.281
I'm double parked, they will tow.

43:02.112 --> 43:04.114
I'm going Brooklyn on this mommy.

43:07.017 --> 43:08.519
Hey. Hey, guys. I just gotta...

43:08.886 --> 43:11.230
Hey, hey! Don't be putting
your hands on me.

43:11.288 --> 43:13.632
Get your fucking hands off me!

43:14.692 --> 43:17.400
Okay, okay. Relax, you got me. You got me.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.415
I'm on him.

43:31.976 --> 43:33.956
<i>Stand</i> down.

43:34.645 --> 43:36.784
<i>Gloria, he made you.
Stand back and wait for me.</i>

43:37.615 --> 43:41.256
- I'm right behind him.
- He's made you, <i>wait</i> for me.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.842
All right, I still have the signal.
I'm gonna go to the next station.

43:56.667 --> 43:58.408
Connelly, he's right here, we can take him.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.513
No, stand back, he made you, wait for me.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.954
Shit!

44:06.076 --> 44:07.282
Shit.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.625
- Drew, you still have the signal?
- Yeah, I still got him.

44:10.681 --> 44:13.184
The signal's still very strong.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.166
Wait a minute, it's gone,
I dropped the signal.

44:23.427 --> 44:24.804
He's gone.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.536
Holden's team found the broker.

44:47.685 --> 44:50.723
I can't have you
tapping citizens' cell phones.

44:51.121 --> 44:55.399
Or your team
running around the city resisting arrest.

44:55.793 --> 44:57.170
I understand that.

44:58.128 --> 45:01.075
I'll keep them clean, I
just need a little rope.

45:01.165 --> 45:04.009
Maybe another 24 hours, that's all.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.706
All right, 24 hours.

45:05.803 --> 45:07.305
Thank you very much.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.319
Sir.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.659
Sir! Doctor!

45:39.069 --> 45:40.173
<i>Da.</i>

45:48.612 --> 45:50.717
He lived?

45:52.716 --> 45:55.788
Just make sure that you
get the winning bid.

46:02.126 --> 46:03.400
How is he?

46:04.795 --> 46:06.706
He just got out of hospital an hour ago.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.376
He's one tough
son of a bitch, I'll give you that.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.874
The triggerman did get away,

46:10.934 --> 46:13.710
but the Lieutenant was able to
convince our Bulgarian friends here

46:13.871 --> 46:16.579
to give us access
to all the cellular towers in the country.

46:16.640 --> 46:17.778
Drew?

46:17.875 --> 46:19.081
Yeah, I got a signal on the broker's phone,

46:19.143 --> 46:21.248
as long as he keeps the battery in it,
I can track him anywhere.

46:21.311 --> 46:22.449
Okay.

46:22.579 --> 46:24.286
My new team goes out in five.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.728
What? New team?

46:26.784 --> 46:28.457
A new team?

46:28.819 --> 46:31.163
What are you talking about?
This is our mission.

46:31.321 --> 46:33.130
Come on, Drew. Back us up, man.

46:33.223 --> 46:35.430
- Gentlemen, Holden needs you in office.
- This is our mission.

46:35.492 --> 46:37.492
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

46:39.163 --> 46:41.734
Hey, guys. You surprised me.

46:41.899 --> 46:44.072
You weren't half bad, considering...

46:55.179 --> 46:56.419
Considering what?

46:56.480 --> 46:58.016
You know what, this is a good thing.

46:58.115 --> 46:59.635
We're all still alive, we can go home.

46:59.650 --> 47:02.153
- Drew? Drew?
- We can live our lives, we can...

47:03.320 --> 47:04.594
Considering what?

47:07.157 --> 47:09.865
Considering who you are. Considering, um...

47:12.162 --> 47:14.039
Considering how I picked you guys.

47:14.264 --> 47:17.268
We know how you picked us.
It was the algorithms.

47:17.434 --> 47:19.235
You hacked the database,
crunched the numbers.

47:19.269 --> 47:21.044
We came out on top.

47:21.672 --> 47:22.810
Right?

47:23.273 --> 47:25.617
I did hack the database.

47:26.877 --> 47:29.323
But I was looking for agents who were C-86.

47:30.380 --> 47:32.951
C-86? What's that?

47:33.116 --> 47:35.460
It's a classification
for agents who are,

47:37.888 --> 47:39.162
<i>throwaways.</i>

47:41.058 --> 47:42.298
Disposable.

47:42.793 --> 47:44.397
You brought us here to die?

47:44.494 --> 47:46.701
No. I brought you here to fail!

47:47.197 --> 47:50.235
I was hoping that if we washed out early,
Holden would disband us

47:50.334 --> 47:52.473
and I could go back to working alone.

47:53.136 --> 47:54.877
I ain't no throwaway!

47:55.339 --> 47:58.081
I knew they were sending me
on suicide mission!

47:58.976 --> 48:00.319
That's why I ran.

48:00.644 --> 48:03.682
You guys saw what
they tried to do to Holden because of me.

48:04.348 --> 48:06.555
None of us are cut out
for an assignment like this.

48:06.650 --> 48:08.823
Let's be honest, okay?

48:08.886 --> 48:11.389
- You son of a bitch.
- Gloria...

48:11.488 --> 48:14.765
You know, I gave up being taken
seriously as an agent a long time ago,

48:15.025 --> 48:17.699
then you come along
and offer us a real assignment

48:18.695 --> 48:20.265
and tell us it was all a joke.

48:20.364 --> 48:21.672
You're not a joke.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.444
I just wanted to get to know you.

48:27.037 --> 48:30.075
Why don't you just go back
to playing with your little toys?

48:38.448 --> 48:40.052
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

48:55.132 --> 48:57.271
The signal's still
strong from the inside.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.815
<i>Go in, get the broker, and then get out.</i>

49:53.457 --> 49:55.177
Yo, man,
I got your message, man. What's up?

49:55.225 --> 49:57.501
Yeah, we think a black hatter
named Teebs has Pantheon.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.265
Didn't he speak in Antwerp last year?

49:59.329 --> 50:02.401
Yeah. Demonstrated how
he could take over a 747 with his iPhone.

50:02.466 --> 50:03.638
The guy's a legit psycho.

50:03.734 --> 50:06.408
Okay, I need you to pull up whatever
surveillance pics you can. All right?

50:06.470 --> 50:07.744
Just single him out.

50:07.804 --> 50:11.183
I think we got a few of him on stage, but
the guy's wearing a mask. He's not dumb.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.317
What exactly are you looking for?

50:13.643 --> 50:16.453
I don't know, man.
Just pull whatever you can, okay?

50:16.513 --> 50:17.924
<i>All right.</i>

50:33.864 --> 50:35.969
All right,
we're closing in, boys.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.808
Signal's red-hot.

50:58.255 --> 51:00.257
They're right on top of him.

51:11.435 --> 51:12.607
Shit!

51:13.770 --> 51:15.215
He's not here, sir.

51:15.272 --> 51:16.792
There's definitely somebody been here.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.046
Guys, he on the move.

51:18.108 --> 51:19.678
Shit! He's right above us.

51:53.543 --> 51:55.819
Sir? We've got a mule in here.

51:56.213 --> 51:57.283
So get rid of him.

51:58.315 --> 51:59.953
The signal's on the mule.

52:12.829 --> 52:13.933
<i>It's the broker.</i>

52:14.164 --> 52:16.166
Connelly! Connelly, get out of there!

52:16.500 --> 52:17.843
Everyone out!

52:17.968 --> 52:19.572
I repeat, fall back!

52:19.836 --> 52:21.179
Stanford, watch your six!

52:22.405 --> 52:23.577
Stanford! Do you read?

52:25.075 --> 52:26.418
Stanford!

52:35.318 --> 52:36.490
Princeton!

52:47.130 --> 52:48.268
Connelly?

52:48.331 --> 52:50.004
Princeton, I lost signal.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.972
Princeton?

52:59.643 --> 53:01.452
Jennifer?

53:01.645 --> 53:03.056
Hey, Dan.

53:03.146 --> 53:04.284
Miss me?

53:11.221 --> 53:12.359
Killed them.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.030
That's it? That's what you want?

53:46.089 --> 53:47.898
That surprises you?

53:48.225 --> 53:51.035
Hey. It's your money, man. Your choice.

53:51.895 --> 53:55.274
But if you have a beef with Moscow,
I can melt them down.

53:55.365 --> 53:57.902
I melt down Moscow and I get what?

53:58.435 --> 54:01.609
Nothing but dead brothers
and martial law for my enemy.

54:03.540 --> 54:06.077
My army will
never be big enough to get me back home.

54:06.176 --> 54:07.712
But if I have friends,

54:07.944 --> 54:12.017
armies in other countries,
then, then perhaps I could.

54:12.616 --> 54:14.061
A false flag.

54:14.117 --> 54:16.393
Blow up your own place,
then blame the bad guys.

54:18.054 --> 54:20.762
- Everyone needs a Pearl Harbor.
- Okay.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.966
I'll make it happen from the airport.

54:24.194 --> 54:26.401
Lights go out, you'll know it's on.

54:26.796 --> 54:30.107
Just transfer the money to my account
and I'll bump it to phase two.

54:30.967 --> 54:33.413
I prefer that you stay until it's over.

54:35.639 --> 54:37.380
That's not the deal we brokered.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.942
Broker is dead.

54:41.378 --> 54:43.722
Bes. Take him out.

54:51.554 --> 54:53.727
Now, that would be foolish.

54:54.991 --> 54:58.234
He pays me twice what you do.

55:08.571 --> 55:10.244
How long do you need?

55:10.307 --> 55:11.581
Ten minutes.

55:12.175 --> 55:13.347
Five.

55:20.483 --> 55:21.826
We got the Pentagon on satellite link.

55:21.918 --> 55:23.192
Great. Put him on.

55:23.586 --> 55:24.758
Hey, Bens. What's up?

55:24.821 --> 55:26.266
<i>Hey, Holden, listen to me.</i>

55:26.323 --> 55:28.496
<i>I got a hit on your female assassin.</i>

55:28.658 --> 55:31.366
<i>Her name is Bettina "Bes" Karpov.</i>

55:31.594 --> 55:35.132
<i>She is a human chameleon
and a highly valued Russian asset.</i>

55:35.332 --> 55:36.640
She was raised in the UK

55:36.700 --> 55:40.705
and is currently in the employ of
one General Olag Konstantin.

55:40.804 --> 55:43.045
<i>He defected from Russia when the Wall fell</i>

55:43.139 --> 55:47.178
<i>and is currently in charge of over
one-third of Bulgaria's armed forces.</i>

55:47.277 --> 55:50.121
He is a staunch opponent
of his adopted army

55:50.180 --> 55:52.660
being taken over by NATO and the EU.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.120
<i>Holden, listen to me.</i>

55:54.184 --> 55:58.223
<i>You and your team have got
to get to that key before he does.</i>

55:58.455 --> 56:01.493
This bastard hates Russia
as much as he does Europe.

56:02.058 --> 56:04.538
He gets the key, he'll start World War Ill.

56:05.161 --> 56:06.299
Are you ready?

56:10.500 --> 56:13.674
This was
a Communist retreat for us Generals.

56:13.737 --> 56:15.045
Party leaders.

56:16.539 --> 56:18.541
Now it's falling apart.

56:20.076 --> 56:23.683
Most Russian special forces
once came from Bulgaria, did you know that?

56:25.882 --> 56:28.192
No, man. I did not know that.

56:28.818 --> 56:31.389
This country was Moscow's little brother.

56:31.888 --> 56:34.232
Now we are Europe's little sister.

56:34.324 --> 56:36.167
It's time to change that.

56:36.226 --> 56:39.105
So, yes, I am ready.

56:40.997 --> 56:43.409
I've been ready for a long time.

56:46.236 --> 56:47.408
Okay.

56:48.271 --> 56:49.716
Here we go.

56:54.444 --> 56:56.048
It has begun.

57:02.051 --> 57:03.359
Backup power's on.

57:03.420 --> 57:04.626
It's started.

57:04.721 --> 57:07.224
Sir, the landline just went dead.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.031
He cut off the cell towers.

57:09.092 --> 57:10.537
Come on, get your ass
in there and do something.

57:10.593 --> 57:11.901
He could be anywhere
on the planet right now!

57:11.961 --> 57:14.567
We don't find the key,
there's nothing I can do.

57:14.631 --> 57:17.271
Okay. Hey, how many
tactical teams we got available right now?

57:17.367 --> 57:18.471
None.

57:18.902 --> 57:20.939
No. He just shut down the water!

57:21.037 --> 57:22.448
What can't he shut down?

57:23.039 --> 57:25.713
DOD satellite and GPS.
Everything else he owns.

57:25.775 --> 57:27.777
Good, good. Hey, I need a DOD phone.

57:27.877 --> 57:29.584
We've got a DOD link right here.

57:29.646 --> 57:31.592
- I need that.
- Here.

57:31.915 --> 57:33.417
Who's got it?

57:34.083 --> 57:35.153
Yo?

57:35.251 --> 57:37.959
I need you to tell me
everything you have on Teebs, okay?

57:38.054 --> 57:40.625
Dude, we got a boatload of photos of him
from the black hat presentation,

57:40.723 --> 57:42.603
but like I said,
he's got on a mask and glasses.

57:42.659 --> 57:45.333
All right. Well, describe him to me.
Okay? Everything that you see.

57:45.428 --> 57:46.930
Dude, he's exactly what you would expect.

57:46.996 --> 57:49.408
Typical sideways hat wearing, neckbeard.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.571
Vaping through some creepy skull bandanna.

57:51.768 --> 57:53.076
Looks like the devil when he exhales.

57:53.136 --> 57:55.878
Vape? Wait! Vaping? Stop.
Like an electronic cigarette?

57:55.972 --> 57:58.350
No. It's like a little metal pipe.

57:58.441 --> 57:59.545
Like a vape pen?

57:59.642 --> 58:01.315
<i>Yeah, yeah, something like that.</i>

58:02.479 --> 58:04.459
All right, describe the vape pen.

58:04.681 --> 58:07.662
Man, I don't smoke.
What does this have to do with anything?

58:07.717 --> 58:10.197
Just keep describing it! What color is it?

58:10.353 --> 58:14.301
Silver, about the size of a cigar.
It's got like a, clown on...

58:15.124 --> 58:17.297
No, it's a skull. It's got
a skull on the front.

58:20.029 --> 58:21.565
Is the tip metal or plastic?

58:21.664 --> 58:23.234
<i>Plastic.</i>

58:24.567 --> 58:25.978
What are you talking about?

58:26.035 --> 58:30.347
Teebs uses the skull head model
of an EK-928-C vaporizer. Okay?

58:30.406 --> 58:32.579
The only way you can
charge that thing is with a USB port.

58:32.675 --> 58:35.588
Chinese manufacturers
put a back-door in everything.

58:35.678 --> 58:38.386
So, I guarantee you that every time
he charges that son of a bitch,

58:38.581 --> 58:41.562
they track his location.
I just need to get into their mainframe.

58:45.855 --> 58:47.095
I'm in.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.398
Tell me you got him.

58:50.493 --> 58:52.097
Who handles your GPS locations?

58:52.195 --> 58:53.902
- Nadine? Nadine?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

58:53.997 --> 58:55.340
Look at these numbers,

58:55.398 --> 58:58.345
just tell me any numbers that have
the same longitude and latitude.

58:58.401 --> 59:00.847
Yeah. It's this one, this one and that one.

59:00.904 --> 59:02.247
Okay, that's three. All right.

59:02.338 --> 59:05.080
That's a bakery in Odessa.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.585
An apartment in Sumy.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.286
And a power plant in Sofia.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.882
I got him! I got him!

59:12.048 --> 59:13.686
I got two teams flying in
from Germany right now.

59:13.750 --> 59:15.150
I don't need your teams, man.

59:15.218 --> 59:17.391
I have a team right here, ready to go.

59:18.688 --> 59:20.224
So, you picked us to fail.

59:20.290 --> 59:22.451
But now you want us
to volunteer for a suicide mission?

59:23.359 --> 59:25.930
There are no terms under
which I want to die.

59:26.529 --> 59:28.975
Yeah, no thanks. Bring in the A-Team.

59:29.065 --> 59:30.772
Listen, I made a mistake.

59:31.234 --> 59:32.577
Okay? I made a mistake!

59:32.635 --> 59:34.774
I'm sorry, I...

59:35.371 --> 59:37.317
I don't have
a lot of experience dealing with...

59:37.407 --> 59:39.148
- People?
- Yes. That, yes.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.949
I misjudged you. Okay?

59:41.044 --> 59:42.785
Gloria, I looked at your records.

59:42.879 --> 59:46.952
And despite a negative psych eval
that says you're cold and heartless,

59:47.417 --> 59:50.159
your field tests and your combat evals
were off the charts.

59:50.253 --> 59:52.164
You were the top of your class. Okay?

59:52.255 --> 59:55.725
And just because you have
this beautiful face,

59:56.726 --> 01:00:00.105
this pencil-pushing asshole decided
that you should be a swallow.

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.972
And that's awful.

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:04.111
But this is your decision, this one.

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.110
Not some chauvinist in a suit.

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.618
So, come on.

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:13.981
Okay.

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:17.149
- But I still hate you.
- That's fair.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.092
I'll work on that.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.591
Fish,

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.998
you're a goddamn
cyclone of death and destruction.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.332
Yeah. Well...

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:29.130
But you've been forced to conform.

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:32.605
But if we can harness that insanity,

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.472
and then unleash it at the right moment,

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:39.035
there's not an army
on the planet that can stand up to you.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:45.218
Fine. I'm in, too.

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:48.788
It's only because
I can't walk away from a fight.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.154
Dmitri, listen to me.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.657
Most people would disagree
with what I'm about to say,

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.323
people in this very room.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:02.366
But I'm gonna tell you right now,
you're the best damn wheelman in Europe.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.232
Well...

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:10.505
You're the only person
I trust to get us in and out of there.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.838
No. No.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.644
No. I see what you are doing.

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.818
It won't work.

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.876
You people are crazy.

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.578
Konstantin has an army.

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.819
We are four people.

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.087
We are five people.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.028
I guess you guys need someone like me

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:34.330
to figure out a way to get you
idiots in and out of there alive.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:38.270
Great. So, in addition to me,
Russian special forces,

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:40.096
we have nerd,

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.940
a Mata Hari,

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.704
a mental patient

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.607
and old man.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.580
And you're the Russian agent
that speaks Russian?

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.851
- Yes.
- Wow.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.253
Where are your sneakers?

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.522
Why?

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.459
Well, I heard you run a lot.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.760
He runs a lot.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.739
How'd you like
the old man's boot up your ass?

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:22.715
I will at least drop you off.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.414
Hey. Hey.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.257
I thought you might need this.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.138
Thanks.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.510
You know how to use it, right?

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.276
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.478
Put it away.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:20.870
Fisher. I got you gift. It's in the trunk.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:23.134
That's messed up
because I didn't get you nothing.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:24.845
It's okay.

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.436
An offer of peace and friendship,

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:29.972
since we will most probably
not survive mission.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.451
What is this? Some kind of jinx shit?

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:37.020
That's bad mojo, man, no way.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.190
You slam the trunk, you damage the paint.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.785
You mean damage the rust.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.196
No presents before missions,

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:47.332
especially when you say
you're giving it to me 'cause we might die.

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.298
This present is lucky.

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.700
You will want this present.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.532
Keep the stupid present.
I'll take it after the mission.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.556
Yo, this is some wimp shit right here.

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.558
Why are we going in the back?

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.602
Because Konstantin
has a small army out front,

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.195
and I can't hack
armored vehicles and AK-47s.

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:26.705
What are we even
looking at, anyway?

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.838
The cooling outlet
for the gas turbines.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.206
It's the least guarded entrance.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.042
Well, someone's gotta
at least take out the guys guarding it.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.880
All right. Go ahead. Get
it out of your system.

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:44.557
Hey, Fisher, um...

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.559
First of all, how's it going?

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:49.856
Good.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.467
I'm gonna tell you something that you're
probably not gonna like very much.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:58.301
I stole a peek at your personnel files.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:03.200
And you are not the best shot in the group.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.409
No, no, not me. Her.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.641
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not. Sorry.

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:25.830
She might be good, but is she fast?
There's two guys.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.960
She hits one, she's gotta hit
the other before he sounds the alarm.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.514
Holy...

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.858
That was hot.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:57.827
I know.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:09.970
Okay.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.668
I have a signal. Pantheon is here,

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:14.094
but it looks like
there's miles of tunnels under this thing.

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:26.375
Listen. There's a door.

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.229
All right. Let me take care of this chump.

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.763
Hey, Fisher!
Calm down, man. Not yet. All right?

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:33.732
Listen for once.
Just be patient. Use your head.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.598
How the hell do we get in?

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.398
You're in uniform.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.733
Dmitri?

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.113
Come on, let's go!

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.751
The next guy's mine.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.784
All right.

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:01.862
These guys right here, let's do 'em.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:04.691
Calm down, Fisher.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.399
Just wait.

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.141
All right, let's <i>split</i> up.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:21.113
<i>Grid search. Drew, Gloria, mid-level.</i>

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:24.078
Fisher, Dmitri, basement.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.744
How come I get the basement?

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.550
<i>There's probably less people
for you to kill down there.</i>

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.720
This is bullshit.

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:35.456
I gotta at least get me one guy.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.066
Hey.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.261
This panel's ancient.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.837
Old Soviet technology.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.332
I bet I can hack into
the control room from here.

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:26.942
Holy...

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:30.716
- Holden?
- Drew, what did you find?

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.116
Teebs had Pantheon reroute
all the gas into the city.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:36.255
It's gonna overload the system. The pipes
are gonna burst, the city's gonna...

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.383
The city's gonna blow up.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:41.689
<i>If they can blow up this city,
they can blow up anything, anywhere.</i>

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:44.854
We gotta find that key.

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:55.971
Hey, man.
Someone just hacked into your mainframe.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.642
There's only one way to do that.

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.647
- Which is?
- Be in the building.

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.314
He's lying-

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:04.977
- I'm not the one who lies.
- Keep an eye on him.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:21.568
So, are you playing
the General, too? Or was it just me?

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.169
No. Just you.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.612
Hey. What's that say, right there?

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.112
You can't read this?

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.689
Knife. Fork.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.692
It says this way to food place.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:48.926
Hells yeah!

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.520
That means there's gonna be
a shit ton of guys in there.

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:53.858
Let me go in first and spray 'em.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.129
Hey!

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:57.032
We have uniform.

01:09:57.092 --> 01:10:00.073
I speak okay Bulgarian,
you don't have to shoot?

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.202
Come on, man.
We're in the basement.

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:03.470
No one's gonna hear us.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:05.939
He's mad.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.071
Come on, man! Let's go!

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.880
Damn it!

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:18.758
All right. We're going to the cafeteria.
If anyone's hungry, speak up.

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.269
<i>Quit the humor, will you?</i>

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:22.796
Take it nice and easy. No mistakes.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.094
Hey, yeah, I know, a stealth mission.
You suck the fun out of everything.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.166
It's empty.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.404
Shh!

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.639
Cigarette's still burning.

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:43.010
Those scum-sucking pigs
are here somewhere.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.682
That is just plain weird.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.826
It's like everyone just up and left.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.296
<i>Well, there's plenty
down here, Fisher, so stay off the com.</i>

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:00.627
Yeah, man. Calm down. Don't kill anyone.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.946
Guys, it's like
something's going on down here.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.817
Like everyone
just disappeared all of a sudden.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:22.981
Go.

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.533
It's kind of spooky
down here in the dungeon.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.194
I should have had to kill
at least one guy to be at this point.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.477
What the hell?

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:52.348
<i>Fisher,
I just told you. Cut the chatter will you?</i>

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:55.150
Okay, looks like
a zombie movie down here.

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:59.181
There's half-eaten meals, warm coffee.
It's as creepy as shit.

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.008
<i>Just keep your
finger off the trigger</i>

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:03.189
<i>so you don't blow your balls off.</i>

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:05.198
Why does everyone keep saying that to me?

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.825
I'm a trained professional, not an animal.

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:33.058
<i>Was that you Fisher?
What the hell was that?</i>

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.462
Good news, I got my 20.

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.766
And there's cake.

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:44.359
- What did he just say?
- I don't know, something about 20 cakes?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.000
- What did he just say?
- I don't know, something about 20 cakes?

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:56.782
Dmitri!

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:11.162
<i>Security breach, sub level, B6.</i>

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.132
I told you.

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:20.867
<i>Security breach, sub level, B6.</i>

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.378
Guys, I got bad news.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.949
Igor pulled the alarm.

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.348
<i>Who the hell is Igor?</i>

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.044
The birthday boy.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.815
Let's get out of here!

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.199
<i>System malfunction.</i>

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.081
<i>Pressure critical.</i>

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:13.254
<i>Twelve minutes to valve failure.</i>

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.578
Teebs!

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:45.385
It's him, he's got the key.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.551
- Go, I'll keep him busy.
- Just be safe okay?

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.558
Teebs, stop. You don't
have to do this, man.

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.865
You're not a killer, okay, you're a hacker.

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.570
Just give me the key. We can stop this.

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:03.132
I'm a god with this.
You think I'm going to hand it over?

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:04.472
Please?

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.783
- You're going to shoot me?
- Back up, man.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.112
Um...

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.478
<i>What happened?</i>

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:51.449
The key, it's destroyed.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:57.420
Well, clear the hell out of there, will you?
Now! Just get out.

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.827
Holden, we can't clear out.

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:01.865
- Drew.
- Sir, we're losing them.

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:03.758
No, we can't get out, we
have to shut it down!

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.170
- Drew, I can't hear you.
- Holden!

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.941
- Holden!
- Sir, the signal dropped.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.808
All right, get the RSO in here, will you?

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.948
I lost him, are you guys still there?

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:17.982
You heard the order, let's get out of here.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.042
No, we can't just leave,
we have to shut it down.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.281
You said we can't without the key.

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.618
We can't, but if I can
get into the control room

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.283
maybe we can hack the hardware.

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:30.226
I don't hack, I blow shit up.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:31.858
Okay, well, you guys create a diversion.

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:34.298
Gloria and I will get to the control room.

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:36.531
Roger that.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.138
<i>Ten minutes to valve failure.</i>

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:49.009
It's going to get hairy. No pussing out.

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.709
I ain't pussing out, okay?

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:52.752
Look, I need to know you got my back.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:56.152
Yeah, well, why are you climbing?
I don't like heights.

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:57.884
I thought you weren't going to puss out.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.482
Yeah, I ain't no puss.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.922
Set up a perimeter. I
want these men caught.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.254
They are dressed in our uniforms

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.424
but I can ID them.

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:08.530
Hey, yo!

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.261
Check this out.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.667
That's them! That's them!

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.998
Heads up.

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:45.569
<i>Eight minutes to valve failure.</i>

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:58.651
It's an old control room.
Analog, not digital, not my specialty.

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:03.950
Okay.

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.252
Okay.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:12.061
Okay, Pantheon is going to push as
much gas as possible into the city

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.760
using pipe 718 here.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.302
There's nothing we can do to change that,

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:18.632
but I might be able to spoof the hardware

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.968
by swapping out the
server control head lD's.

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:24.773
Right, what does that mean in English?

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:28.945
We need to hot-wire it.

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:31.006
Okay. What can I do to help?

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:44.593
Okay, so, we need to find
as many CAT 5 cables as possible.

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:50.433
Connect that panel over there
with this control board into that computer.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.463
Great. What's a CAT 5 cable?

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.114
Close in. Get them!

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:11.285
Shit, I'm out of grenades.

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:15.959
Dmitri! Dmitri, get back here.

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:18.059
Commie bastard.

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.823
Hey, heads up.

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.505
Thank you.

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.138
So, theoretically, this should work.

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.771
Theoretically?

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.276
In theory.

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:35.575
You say "theoretically" now.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.882
So, how much longer
is this going to take?

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:48.267
Well, I just need
to reset the router, but that takes time.

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:51.389
<i>Hey, Drew,
that crazy Russian broad just got by me.</i>

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.392
She's kind of hot.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.794
Let me go say hello.

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.076
<i>Six minutes to valve failure.</i>

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:36.302
That commie deserted us.

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:38.139
How much longer, Drew?
I'm running out of ammo.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.193
<i>Just a few minutes,
keep up the distraction.</i>

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.696
Turn around!

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.638
Go ahead. Just do it.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.068
Drew, are you almost done?

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.636
- Damn it.
<i>- I'll</i> take that as a no.

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:43.005
<i>- It needs a firmware update.</i>

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:48.673
This is going to take two minutes.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.777
<i>Doesn't this place
blow up in a few minutes?</i>

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:09.067
Drew, be careful',
I lost her. I think she went outside.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.534
I thought you left me, man.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.699
I had to get you present.

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.877
- What, that's for me?
- Bazooka time.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.540
I didn't know Russians made bazookas.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.707
We invented the bazooka.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.047
There they are! Turn left!

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:27.284
Around the corner!

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.081
Take cover!

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.415
Give me the shell.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:35.688
It is Russian,
more difficult to fire. I will shoot...

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.594
No, no, bullshit, man.
This is my present. You already got one.

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.462
Aiming this can be a little tricky.

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.796
Don't tell me about aim.
I was this close to being special forces.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.393
- Come on.
- Big deal.

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.405
Attack! They are going to shoot!

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.432
Bazooka time.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.816
Okay, that went a little wide.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.651
You destroyed her.

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:07.617
Well, I'm sorry, man, collateral
damage. Just get me another shell.

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:09.252
Shells are in trunk.

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.077
You left the shells in the trunk?
What the...

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:13.293
Because you didn't want present.

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:17.162
Now is our chance... turn the gun!

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:20.799
I don't care anymore, car is dead.

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:23.809
Stop, stop, come here.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.609
Look, if we're going to do this,

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.011
we gotta be smart, we gotta use our heads.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.742
I've got a plan.
Follow me, come on, come on.

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.344
They're getting away!

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:52.335
<i>Drew, I'm not sure how much longer
I can hold her off.</i>

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.268
All right, I'm going to
try something, hang on.

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:11.646
Sorry, sorry,
that was the wrong wire, obviously.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.283
It's got to be this guy right here.

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.498
What happened? That wasn't it.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:25.193
Drew, are we going to blow up?
'Cause I'd kind of like to know.

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:28.672
There's really only one more of these.

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.149
<i>Come on, Drew.</i>

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.157
Yeah, I'm almost there.

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:52.329
<i>Two minutes to valve failure.</i>

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:07.945
You killed my car...

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.380
prepare to die!

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.786
Shoot... shoot now!

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.900
Fisher!

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.027
In the grass stop... stop!

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.807
Shalom, motherfucker.

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:56.621
Fisher!

01:25:58.586 --> 01:25:59.826
I got me a tank!

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.336
<i>Fifteen seconds to valve failure.</i>

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.140
<i>Ten seconds to valve failure.</i>

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:24.320
<i>Five seconds to valve failure.</i>

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:36.863
We did it. It worked.

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.339
Hey, hey, what happened?

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:14.702
I just cut my thumb.

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.540
.L-Hey-.l-Hey-

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:27.115
Hey, Fisher, on com earlier,
you said something about cake, didn't you?
