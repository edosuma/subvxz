00:54.586 --> 00:56.448

"quarantine"?

00:56.517 --> 00:58.482
'Cause I can't even
read that handwriting.

00:58.551 --> 01:01.172
- All right, y'all,
it's, like, day eight

01:01.241 --> 01:03.172
of quarantine.

01:03.241 --> 01:04.689
It's miserable.

01:04.758 --> 01:07.448
- This is what I do; I walk
around my hotel room naked

01:07.517 --> 01:08.482
and get my steps in.

01:08.551 --> 01:10.689
I love working out.

01:10.758 --> 01:13.448

push workout.

01:13.517 --> 01:15.689
- Attaboy.

01:15.758 --> 01:18.344
- Oh,
- I'm gonna get another bottle,

01:18.413 --> 01:20.862

is when you're at quarantine.

That's the cue.

Pigs, like, they just
and piss everywhere,

03:12.344 --> 03:15.275
and they squeal a lot
and oink a lot,

03:15.344 --> 03:17.896
but they do love to snuggle.

03:17.965 --> 03:21.448
Okay, piggy, first of all,
I'm gonna need you to be quiet,

03:21.517 --> 03:25.000
because Codi does not know
that you're coming with me.

03:25.068 --> 03:26.965
Second of all,
when he does figure out

03:27.034 --> 03:28.862
that you're in the car,

03:28.931 --> 03:33.448
I'm gonna need you to pretend
to be a dog, not a pig.

03:33.517 --> 03:37.586
That's right, bark, bark, bark.
You're a dog.

03:37.655 --> 03:39.896
Okay, we need
to pick out your outfit

03:39.965 --> 03:42.137

Princess Goddess Piggy,

03:58.620 --> 04:00.344

04:18.482 --> 04:21.482
Our last night in Havasu
was a mess.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.241
<i>We kind of left
everything scattered</i>

04:24.310 --> 04:27.034

You know, I think
this vacation could be

04:36.827 --> 04:38.448
a clean slate for everyone.

04:38.517 --> 04:40.551
<i>Like, I hope everybody can put

04:43.103 --> 04:45.586
Here we go.

04:49.827 --> 04:51.137
- I pretty much got
everything packed.

04:51.206 --> 04:52.137
I just need to throw
a extra couple of things.

04:52.206 --> 04:53.551

04:53.620 --> 04:55.413
- Yeah, you can just carry
those downstairs, though.

04:55.482 --> 04:58.103
The way the last vacation
ended, it was very abrupt.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.793
There was a lot on the table.

04:59.862 --> 05:01.413
Obviously,
it was very aggressive,

05:01.482 --> 05:04.034
<i>and now we've got all kinds
of unresolved issues,</i>

05:04.103 --> 05:05.931

05:08.103 --> 05:09.275

05:11.172 --> 05:12.724
That, those shirts,
and those shirts

05:12.793 --> 05:15.000
and then I'll load up all my
pants in this backpack.

- Gus, should I go ahead
and pack my hospital bag?

05:27.137 --> 05:29.103
What if I go into labor
on vacation?

05:29.172 --> 05:31.241
The last time you guys saw me
I wasn't sure

05:31.310 --> 05:33.620
if I was having a baby girl
or baby boy,

05:33.689 --> 05:38.068
but we found out
that I am having a baby boy,

05:38.137 --> 05:41.482
and we decided to name him
Gray Allen Gazda.

05:41.551 --> 05:43.448
<i>Gray is the name
that I've always liked.</i>

05:43.517 --> 05:46.793
<i>Allen is my dad's middle name,
so we're attributing him,</i>

05:46.862 --> 05:48.275
<i>and it really
makes me miss him.</i>

05:48.344 --> 05:50.620
But I know he's here
with us in spirit.

05:50.689 --> 05:52.206
- But what do you take
to the hospital?

05:52.275 --> 05:54.896
- The basic things you need is,
like, diapers,

05:54.965 --> 05:56.896
clothes, and diaper for me.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.931
- You're wearing diapers?
- You have to wear a diaper

05:59.000 --> 06:02.068
after you give birth.
You rip from your--

06:02.137 --> 06:05.793
- Shh. Okay, I get it.
I get it.

06:05.862 --> 06:08.241
- Welcome to parenthood.
- Yeah.

06:08.310 --> 06:09.620
- Now that I'm in my
third trimester,

06:09.689 --> 06:11.620
<i>there is so much more
going on.</i>

06:11.689 --> 06:14.413
<i>I could not be more happy
about this vacation.</i>

06:14.482 --> 06:15.862
<i>We're gonna Athens, Georgia,</i>

06:15.931 --> 06:17.448
<i>which is right down the road

06:17.517 --> 06:18.931
<i>It is such a relief
that we're going to be</i>

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
so close to my doctor's
appointments and my fiancé.

06:22.068 --> 06:23.724
What if the baby comes out
and I on him?

06:23.793 --> 06:25.862
Because I probably will poop
when I give birth.

06:25.931 --> 06:27.034
- Oh, man, all right.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.275
- Are you gonna be okay
with that?

06:28.344 --> 06:29.413
- Yeah, I mean,
they'll wash him off.

06:29.482 --> 06:30.862
What are you talking about?

06:30.931 --> 06:32.241
- No, you're supposed to get
handed the baby first.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.275
- You worry about the weirdest
literally.

06:34.344 --> 06:35.965

And literally we have
to go through a gated entrance.

27:04.965 --> 27:07.758
- Carry me.
Oh, this is fancy.

27:07.827 --> 27:11.965
Oh, my Lord.
This is "Georgiabama Shore."

27:12.034 --> 27:15.448
- We made it!
- Let's go!

27:15.517 --> 27:18.862
- Where's everybody?

27:18.931 --> 27:22.379
- Oh, I can't move that fast.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:22.448 --> 27:24.655
- Jeremiah, look.

27:24.724 --> 27:26.724
- A pig?
- It's Dalmatian.

27:26.793 --> 27:28.413
- Hey, Aimee.
- It's a Dalmatian.

27:28.482 --> 27:29.586
- No jumping.

27:29.655 --> 27:32.793
- Hey, y'all gotta give
me credit.

27:32.862 --> 27:34.517
Oh, my God.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.931
<i>What is this?</i>

27:36.000 --> 27:38.310
There's a dog and a pig
running in the house.

27:38.379 --> 27:41.068
I'm like,
"Well, the dog makes sense.

27:41.137 --> 27:45.275
Where did the pig come from?"
Let me guess, Aimee?

27:45.344 --> 27:49.793
- Bro, it in her purse.
Here's the purse; lookit.

27:49.862 --> 27:51.793
- Ew, yo.

27:51.862 --> 27:54.586
- You are big as [bleep];
that is all baby.

27:54.655 --> 27:56.137
<i>Do you see how big Nilsa is?</i>

27:56.206 --> 27:59.103
That baby literally about
to be about 15 goddamn pounds.

27:59.172 --> 28:02.137
- I'm big as

28:02.206 --> 28:04.172
He's not kicking right now.

28:04.241 --> 28:06.172
- I love babies
and babies love me,

28:06.241 --> 28:08.275
so Gray is gonna love me.

28:08.344 --> 28:10.172
- You guys look good up there.
- Thank you.

28:10.241 --> 28:13.206
- It looks like a good spot.
- You okay, Nilsa?

28:13.275 --> 28:14.551
- Mm-hmm, I'm fine.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.137
- 'Cause you know me,
I'm here--I'm here

28:16.206 --> 28:17.551
to support y'all,
so you know what I'm saying?

28:17.620 --> 28:18.724
Like, you okay?

28:18.793 --> 28:20.241
- I know.
I'm here to support y'all,

28:20.310 --> 28:21.827
'cause that's what us girls do;
we support each other.

28:21.896 --> 28:23.482
- yeah, bitch,
empowered women empower women.

28:23.551 --> 28:25.103
- Right.

28:25.172 --> 28:28.206
- And Nilsa's gonna let me eat
some of her placenta pills.

28:28.275 --> 28:29.655
She said she was going
to give me some.

28:29.724 --> 28:31.172
- Will you eat some of those.
Jeremiah?

28:31.241 --> 28:32.344
- I'm out.

28:32.413 --> 28:34.379
- Will you eat
some placenta pills?

28:34.448 --> 28:35.862
- If you tell me
that it at least

28:35.931 --> 28:38.172
has 15 grams of protein in it,
and I probably would.

28:38.241 --> 28:43.413
- It does. You know
breast milk is full of protein?

28:43.482 --> 28:46.517
- Save me 2 pounds, okay?
Forget the protein powder.

28:46.586 --> 28:49.310
All you need is a shot
of breast milk in the morning.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.620
- You would drink my
breast milk?

28:51.689 --> 28:54.275
- Yeah, why not?
Get that pump going.

28:54.344 --> 28:55.724
It's sweet, isn't it?

28:55.793 --> 28:57.172
- Yeah, it taste
like ice cream.

28:57.241 --> 28:58.689
- Ooh-whee.

28:58.758 --> 28:59.862
- I mean, I wouldn't know yet,
but that's what I hear.

28:59.931 --> 29:02.896
- I can't say no;
protein is protein.

- No, you're muddy, Codi.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.379
- Ohh.

30:05.448 --> 30:06.827
- Yo, so we missing
somebody.

30:06.896 --> 30:08.724
Where the
y'all friend at?.

30:08.793 --> 30:11.275
- Oh, yeah, he on a motorcycle
somewhere on the way.

30:11.344 --> 30:12.724
- I hope he is okay.

30:12.793 --> 30:15.379
- I mean, I just worry
about people on motorcycles,

30:15.448 --> 30:16.827
'cause they're, like,
dangerous.

30:16.896 --> 30:18.655
- Yeah, I'm scared
of motorcycles.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.206

30:27.275 --> 30:29.310
I mean, he even left
our group chat.

30:29.379 --> 30:32.517
So I'm anxious,
because who knows

30:32.586 --> 30:34.620
what'll end up to be
this time.

30:34.689 --> 30:37.000
- How is he getting
his clothes here?

30:37.068 --> 30:38.551
- I guess he tied them
to the back.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.620
- I think he's hoping he left
some in the house in Arizona

30:40.689 --> 30:42.206
and you were gonna
bring them.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.758
- What, does he got a backpack
full of clothes? That's it?

30:44.827 --> 30:48.655
- Jeremiah, you've worn
that shirt for four summers.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.310
Jeremiah, this is the fourth
summer you've worn that shirt.

30:51.379 --> 30:53.379
- And I still look great
in it, I know, right?

30:57.689 --> 30:59.620
- I'm about to go
grab another beer.

30:59.689 --> 31:01.206
- Y'all taking a shot?
- Here.

31:01.275 --> 31:02.724
- What are we toasting to?

31:02.793 --> 31:04.931
- Leaving all that bull
in Arizona and Montana.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.206
This is to positive vibes,
good energy all day.

31:08.275 --> 31:10.137
- All day, all day.

31:10.206 --> 31:12.206
- Hey, to the Peach House,
baby.

31:12.275 --> 31:13.965
Whoo!

31:14.034 --> 31:16.586
- I'm so mad you created
that and I didn't.

31:21.482 --> 31:24.586
- Do y'all hear
that motorcycle?

31:24.655 --> 31:26.379
- Hey, that's gotta be Gus;
come on.

31:30.862 --> 31:33.137
Oh, hell no.

31:33.206 --> 31:35.206
- This is

31:35.275 --> 31:39.379
I done heard something.
I done heard some

31:39.448 --> 31:40.862
Wait, oh,
My bad. My bad. My bad.

31:40.931 --> 31:42.379
- No, you're good.
I'm gimping a little bit.

31:42.448 --> 31:43.551
- Ohh...
- What the on...

31:43.620 --> 31:45.137
what's on your--
why are you so dirty?

31:45.206 --> 31:47.103
- Look at the car he came in.
- I want to give you a hug,

31:47.172 --> 31:48.241
but...
- Yo, look at the car

31:48.310 --> 31:49.379
he came in.
- I had to the bitch

31:49.448 --> 31:50.655
out the mud.
- Look at this bitch

31:50.724 --> 31:51.689
right here, bruh.
- Why'd y'all park

31:51.758 --> 31:52.931
in the bushes?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
- Aimee drove.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

31:55.068 --> 31:57.344
- This vibe.
- Bruh, that's mean, ain't it?

31:57.413 --> 31:58.896
Codi, what I said is,
I wanna get a

31:58.965 --> 32:00.655
sidecar attached to it
and have you in a little bucket

32:00.724 --> 32:01.931
with the goggles on.
- The goggles.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.482
Hey, I'll

32:03.551 --> 32:05.103
- You'd be riding the bitch
shirtless.

32:05.172 --> 32:06.206
That would be funny as
- Bruh, this is fire, bruh.

32:10.724 --> 32:12.137
- That sounds dangerous.

32:12.206 --> 32:14.586
- Very.
- Yeah, it sounds dangerous.

32:14.655 --> 32:17.034
With Gus' look, he looks like
he should have a motorcycle,

32:17.103 --> 32:18.724
<i>but for his well-being,</i>

32:18.793 --> 32:20.206
I don't think
he should have a motorcycle.

32:20.275 --> 32:22.965
- I actually do wanna see
his motorcycle,

32:23.034 --> 32:25.000
see what he's cooking with.

32:27.758 --> 32:29.379
Well, Gus definitely is here.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.172
Personally, like, we've had our
animosities towards each other,

32:32.241 --> 32:34.137
and I definitely have
my guard up towards him,

32:34.206 --> 32:36.413
<i>but I really want to keep
positive about the situation</i>

32:36.482 --> 32:38.241
and just have fun on vacation.

32:38.310 --> 32:39.310
- What's up, man? You would
check this thing out?

32:39.379 --> 32:40.551
- Yeah, I heard the sound, man.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.034
I had to hear
what it looked like.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.172
- That's the blinkers there.
- Hey, turn it back on.

32:43.241 --> 32:44.620
- Yeah, I'll turn it on.
- Oh,

32:44.689 --> 32:45.827
these are fire too.
- Yeah, look at that,

32:45.896 --> 32:48.034
I got--
- Bruh, this if fire, bruh.

32:48.103 --> 32:49.379
- Hell yeah.

32:49.448 --> 32:50.862
- Honestly, when I was
picturing, I was like,

32:50.931 --> 32:52.413
it's definitely a mad bike,
and hadn't seen it yet.

32:52.482 --> 32:54.137
- You know, my style.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.482
I couldn't
get no colorful

32:55.551 --> 32:58.896
I'm not a--
I'm not a very colorful guy.

32:58.965 --> 33:02.517
- All right, fellas,
quo foh shot?

33:02.586 --> 33:04.793
<i>- I don't know if the quo foh
is back for real,</i>

33:04.862 --> 33:07.068
but if Jeremiah
would accept Gus for who he is

33:07.137 --> 33:09.000
and Gus would accept Jeremy
for who they are,

33:09.068 --> 33:11.586
you know, we'll be fine.
It'll be all right.

33:11.655 --> 33:13.068
- We all putting it
in here, bro.

33:13.137 --> 33:14.586
We're going to have
good vibes this time, man.

33:14.655 --> 33:16.482
I don't give a
what differences everyone has.

33:16.551 --> 33:17.724
- To being back in
the South, baby.

33:17.793 --> 33:19.034
- Hey-

33:19.103 --> 33:20.172
- Hey, it's good to be
back in the South.

33:20.241 --> 33:21.689
- Hey, let's
have a good time.

33:21.758 --> 33:26.862
- I would my pants
if I seen Gus and Jeremiah

33:26.931 --> 33:29.000
hug it out
by the end of this vacation.

33:29.068 --> 33:30.448
- Let's have fun, man.
- Let's have a good time.

33:30.517 --> 33:33.137
- No petty
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

33:36.034 --> 33:37.551
- Princess Goddess--
- Oh, he's pissing

33:37.620 --> 33:39.310

- Gus, you piss me off;

34:24.344 --> 34:25.862
I hate you sometimes.

34:25.931 --> 34:28.034
Just don't lush out on us all,
because we really love you.

34:28.103 --> 34:29.965
- I know, I'm sorry.
I love you guys too.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.068
- No more tip-toeing
around Gus'

34:32.137 --> 34:34.793
I'm gonna tell him how I feel
straight from my heart,

34:34.862 --> 34:37.931
because he needs
to hear it.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.103
- No, we're gonna make it.
- It looks good.

34:39.172 --> 34:40.241
- It looks good?
Does it match me?

34:40.310 --> 34:41.517
- What, you want me
to drive it?

34:41.586 --> 34:43.896
- So finally
back in the vacation house,

34:43.965 --> 34:45.551
I actually feel
really good about it.

I want all of us
to really enjoy this vacation

34:51.379 --> 34:53.551

that we call each other.

34:53.620 --> 34:56.551
So let's go take some shots
and have a good time.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.965

- All right, cheers.

35:02.034 --> 35:03.586
- Cheers.

35:03.655 --> 35:06.448
