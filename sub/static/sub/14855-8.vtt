00:10.809 --> 00:12.758
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

00:13.503 --> 00:15.792
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:16.197 --> 00:17.175
Put your hands up!

00:17.176 --> 00:19.839
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.456
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

00:22.208 --> 00:23.781
Who the hell are you, people?

00:24.131 --> 00:26.244
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.559 --> 00:29.495
<i>I know all this,
because I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.877 --> 00:31.540
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.575 --> 00:34.176
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.177 --> 00:35.796
<i>Every day, I get another chance.</i>

00:35.797 --> 00:38.129
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

00:38.748 --> 00:40.728
<i>I've been investigating an old murder.</i>

00:40.729 --> 00:41.877
Where am I supposed to look?

00:41.878 --> 00:43.037
A little closer to home.

00:43.038 --> 00:45.334
Your old man was
on the right track with the girl.

00:45.335 --> 00:46.786
<i>My father worked on a case.</i>

00:46.787 --> 00:48.502
<i>It may be the key to this day.</i>

00:49.095 --> 00:50.940
Yeah, Jen, it's me. We need to talk.

00:50.941 --> 00:52.132
It's about dad.

00:53.081 --> 00:55.311
I'm wondering if you have
any of his old stuff...

00:55.324 --> 00:56.740
I'll call you back later today.

00:56.876 --> 00:59.828
<i>And I think my sister knows more
than she's telling.</i>

01:00.637 --> 01:01.865
This is an example

01:01.887 --> 01:04.647
- of how we burry our secrets.
- I understand.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.311
<i>Now, I have to find out
what she's hiding.</i>

01:20.893 --> 01:22.232
- Brett Hopper?
- Yeah.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.665
<i>What exactly are you looking for?</i>

01:24.666 --> 01:26.490
<i>Temporal lobe epilepsy.</i>

01:29.385 --> 01:30.700
<i>Hippocampus looks normal.</i>

01:30.701 --> 01:32.034
No asymmetry or atrophy.

01:35.397 --> 01:37.345
I don't see any sign of neoplasms,

01:37.367 --> 01:40.170
no apparent lesions,
no intracranial trauma.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.070
Then it's all good?

01:43.166 --> 01:44.185
On first look,

01:45.091 --> 01:46.432
no offense, but your brain...

01:47.341 --> 01:48.631
Nothing special.

01:50.362 --> 01:53.097
Do you have a family history
with this sort of thing?

01:54.731 --> 01:55.692
I don't know.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.269
I'm gonna go and see my sister later,
so... I can ask her.

02:10.292 --> 02:11.294
Hello?

02:37.573 --> 02:39.025
Brett, what are you doing here?

02:39.026 --> 02:40.008
Where were you?

02:40.614 --> 02:43.472
At the emergency room.
James had an asthma attack.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.547
- I didn't know he had asthma.
- No, you wouldn't, would you?

02:48.069 --> 02:49.814
- What does that mean?
- Why are you here?

02:49.815 --> 02:51.568
- The police are looking for you.
- I know.

02:51.586 --> 02:54.593
I just had to drop by and pick up
some of dad's old stuff. Case files.

02:54.594 --> 02:55.566
Cops stuff...

02:55.901 --> 02:57.273
I don't have any of that.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.706
Talk to mom.

03:00.522 --> 03:01.726
Jen, come on, be real.

03:01.727 --> 03:04.282
- Why don't you take the kids inside?
- Randall, it's alright.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.287
No, it's late. Take the kids inside.

03:06.859 --> 03:10.125
- I'm not finished with my sister yet.
- Tonight, you are!

03:10.668 --> 03:12.536
Do you really wanna do this now? Here?

03:12.537 --> 03:15.464
Cops said they were running cars by here
regularly until they catch you.

03:15.465 --> 03:16.790
Are you threatening me?

03:20.047 --> 03:22.904
Won't you leave us alone, Brett?
You're good at it.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.954
Why is he asking
for our dad's stuff now?

03:39.167 --> 03:41.239
Do you think he knows
about the briefcase?

03:42.239 --> 03:43.297
I'm not sure.

03:56.996 --> 03:58.021
You're up early.

03:58.966 --> 04:01.967
Hey, baby girl, yeah.
I've got a big day ahead of me.

04:01.968 --> 04:04.670
- I've gotta go to see somebody.
- Anyone I would know?

04:04.703 --> 04:05.700
It's my mom.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.623
Your mom?

04:08.669 --> 04:10.712
I thought the two of you don't talk?

04:10.998 --> 04:11.957
She talks plenty.

04:15.030 --> 04:17.095
I wouldn't be doing this, if...
I didn't have to.

04:17.096 --> 04:18.183
You know, one of these days,

04:18.183 --> 04:21.132
you're gonna have to tell
someone in your family about us.

04:21.163 --> 04:23.737
- Unless, for some other reason...
- Believe me, I'm sparing you.

04:24.078 --> 04:25.249
Brett...

04:26.881 --> 04:27.900
Look.

04:27.912 --> 04:29.177
The only reason I'm going,

04:29.178 --> 04:31.542
is to pick up
some of my dad's old stuff.

04:31.593 --> 04:32.753
- Okay?
- Okay.

04:39.814 --> 04:40.811
See you later.

04:54.113 --> 04:56.234
Word is you killed
two ex-sheriff's deputies.

05:28.087 --> 05:29.119
How you are doing?

05:31.137 --> 05:32.100
Thanks, fellows.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.666
- What the hell?
- Relax!

05:35.393 --> 05:36.422
We got him!

05:49.887 --> 05:51.225
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.588
You're gonna go to school,
you're gonna teach.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.197
You will act like it's a normal day.

05:56.382 --> 05:57.429
What if...

05:57.800 --> 05:59.225
- they come back?
- Then...

05:59.473 --> 06:00.678
I will take care of it.

06:04.444 --> 06:06.105
Maybe we should call someone.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.834
You wanna call Brett again?

06:08.496 --> 06:10.152
How many times
did you call him last night?

06:10.152 --> 06:12.434
Did he pick up? Did he try to call back?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.489
No!

06:18.383 --> 06:20.053
I know... You're right.

06:21.135 --> 06:22.766
He's never been there for us.

06:22.779 --> 06:24.232
We will get through this.

06:25.246 --> 06:26.232
I promise.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.678
Come in.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.607
So these are ex-sheriff's deputies?

06:39.023 --> 06:41.668
I think these are the guys
that are framing me for Garza's murder.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.139
Why would a couple of ex-cops
wanna pin a DA's death on you?

06:44.140 --> 06:46.008
They're just soldiers,
but if I can ID them,

06:46.009 --> 06:48.410
I think I can figure out
who they work for.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.126
All I got to go on is a photo?

06:50.291 --> 06:53.600
I was hoping you still had friends
over there at county.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.113
Yeah, I can ask around.

06:55.887 --> 06:59.147
But if it is true that some ex-cops
are involved, then...

06:59.451 --> 07:01.732
we both gotta be careful who we talk to.

07:01.977 --> 07:02.974
I know.

07:03.936 --> 07:04.908
Where are you headed?

07:04.909 --> 07:05.870
To my mom's.

07:06.188 --> 07:08.288
I've gotta go dig up some old ghosts.

07:08.665 --> 07:09.631
Thanks.

07:29.288 --> 07:30.684
Mamma, it's me!

07:31.247 --> 07:32.228
I know.

07:35.310 --> 07:36.210
+

07:38.926 --> 07:40.705
I received a phone call this morning.

07:40.705 --> 07:42.800
You're wanted for murder
and you didn't tell me?

07:42.801 --> 07:44.094
I didn't do it, mamma!

07:44.253 --> 07:45.242
Of course not.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.003
I didn't raise a murderer.

07:47.004 --> 07:48.030
But that's not the point!

07:48.031 --> 07:51.669
Don't worry, I'll be out of here
before your husband gets home.

07:51.801 --> 07:53.524
His name is Henry.

07:53.985 --> 07:56.506
Are you gonna to talk to me
about this Brett, or am I gonna have

07:56.507 --> 07:57.575
to read it in the papers?

07:57.598 --> 08:00.256
Look, mamma.
I'm here so I can clear my name.

08:00.469 --> 08:02.390
Well, running never solved anything!

08:02.400 --> 08:03.809
I'm sure if you turn yourself in,

08:03.810 --> 08:05.548
they'd find
this was a big misunderstanding.

08:05.548 --> 08:06.942
Please, just listen to me.

08:07.513 --> 08:08.789
I know this all set up

08:09.370 --> 08:11.987
has to do with a case
daddy worked 15 years ago.

08:12.801 --> 08:13.809
I need his files.

08:15.774 --> 08:17.879
You came for your father's things...

08:19.332 --> 08:22.023
Your father and I divorced
long before he passed.

08:22.248 --> 08:24.702
What makes you think
I kept anything of his?

08:24.703 --> 08:25.772
Jen told me you did.

08:25.773 --> 08:26.740
Well, I didn't.

08:26.741 --> 08:28.351
All of his things are in storage.

08:28.352 --> 08:29.325
Jen knows that,

08:29.343 --> 08:31.035
she's the one that put them here.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.462
Do you know where the storage place is,
mamma?

08:33.462 --> 08:34.432
Of course, I do.

08:42.615 --> 08:44.339
Mamma, there was a stop sign,
back there!

08:44.361 --> 08:47.202
They just put that in,
I'm not stopping for that!

08:48.281 --> 08:49.790
How was you sister when you saw her?

08:49.791 --> 08:52.208
I'm wanted for murder,
and all you can ask me about is Jen?

08:52.209 --> 08:55.193
I'm just hoping you didn't bring in
this trouble to her door.

08:55.194 --> 08:56.725
She got a family to think about.

08:56.726 --> 08:57.973
She's just fine.

08:57.974 --> 08:59.517
She's stronger than you think.

08:59.518 --> 09:00.631
Believe me, I know.

09:00.992 --> 09:03.257
When are you gonna find someone special?

09:03.616 --> 09:07.434
- You could use a woman's touch.
- Yeah. Or a bullet to the head.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.195
So, you wanna do drinks?

09:17.546 --> 09:21.216
Yeah, sure! I've always had
a sauce pot for you boys at county.

09:21.217 --> 09:22.871
Hey! While I have you on the line,

09:22.872 --> 09:24.595
I was wondering,
if I email you something,

09:24.596 --> 09:26.492
can you put some names on faces for me?

09:26.527 --> 09:27.536
Battle!

09:29.426 --> 09:30.676
I gotta call you back.

09:31.825 --> 09:33.411
You're late. What are you doing?

09:33.412 --> 09:34.377
Working...

09:34.378 --> 09:36.895
Is your work
more important than your career?

09:41.553 --> 09:42.522
Who are they?

09:44.554 --> 09:45.515
Suspects.

09:46.873 --> 09:47.836
What's the case?

09:48.059 --> 09:49.030
A crime...

09:50.474 --> 09:54.284
They're a couple of guys who
might be connected to the Garza murder.

09:57.294 --> 09:58.509
Who asked you to look into it?

09:58.510 --> 10:00.345
- Was it Hopper?
- It's personal.

10:02.474 --> 10:03.468
So...

10:04.422 --> 10:06.728
You wanna do that meeting now, or what?

10:08.622 --> 10:09.605
Meeting's off.

10:17.838 --> 10:18.904
I don't understand.

10:20.012 --> 10:22.280
The police wanna talk to me about Brett.

10:22.341 --> 10:24.634
Just go with the detective.
Answer his questions.

10:24.926 --> 10:25.888
Don't panic.

10:26.389 --> 10:28.236
- What if those men call?
- They won't.

10:28.237 --> 10:30.285
We already gave them
what they were asking for.

10:30.286 --> 10:32.059
We didn't give them everything.

10:33.879 --> 10:36.501
- Maybe I should go to the bank.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

10:36.502 --> 10:37.960
OK, I'll pick up the kids,

10:38.336 --> 10:42.479
we'll be waiting for you at home
when you get back from the station, OK?

10:42.480 --> 10:43.966
This has nothing to do with us.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.757
What's all the whispering about?

10:46.636 --> 10:48.026
Is somebody telling secrets?

10:55.418 --> 10:57.147
It's a good thing you came here.

10:57.628 --> 10:59.705
Of course, I never thought
it'd take 8 years

10:59.706 --> 11:02.655
for you to show up
and weed through all of this.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.715
What's all my stuff doing here?

11:08.064 --> 11:09.632
That was you father's doing.

11:10.482 --> 11:12.288
He always held on to your things.

11:12.289 --> 11:13.822
I thought I lost all this.

11:14.437 --> 11:16.395
- I never knew that he...
- They're all gone!

11:16.625 --> 11:18.698
- What?
- Your father's notes.

11:18.907 --> 11:21.403
They were stacked in a dozen boxes
against this wall.

11:21.404 --> 11:23.648
Well, does anybody else have a key
besides you and Jen?

11:23.649 --> 11:24.620
Well, Nick.

11:25.089 --> 11:27.124
- He helped us back then.
- Uncle Nick?

11:27.335 --> 11:29.605
I suppose it makes sense
if he took them.

11:30.061 --> 11:31.717
They were partners for years.

11:33.782 --> 11:35.241
I hope he did take them.

11:36.431 --> 11:37.656
And burned them.

11:45.051 --> 11:46.085
Uncle Nick!

11:47.004 --> 11:49.284
Are you out of your damn mind,
coming here?

11:49.653 --> 11:50.960
Get your ass inside.

11:51.823 --> 11:54.625
Haven't heard from you in months,
now there's this non-sense?

11:54.626 --> 11:56.583
- News travels fast.
- Are you kidding?

11:57.774 --> 11:59.736
There's retired cops
all over this marina.

11:59.737 --> 12:02.475
I need any of my dad's files
you might have taken out of storage.

12:02.861 --> 12:03.915
Are you calling me a thief?

12:04.165 --> 12:07.255
Well, I asked Jen if she had them,
she said no and neither does my mother.

12:07.256 --> 12:08.219
That leaves you.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.254
I never took anything out of
that place.

12:11.526 --> 12:14.873
No offense, but it's something she just
don't wanna be reminded of, you know.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.645
Look, I just need any notes,

12:16.834 --> 12:19.656
files, connected to this one case
I'm looking into.

12:20.978 --> 12:24.241
It was a Jane Doe, I find out
her name is Isabella Contreras.

12:26.123 --> 12:27.514
- You remember it?
- No.

12:28.607 --> 12:29.582
Are you sure ?

12:29.778 --> 12:31.665
You know how many of those we saw?

12:31.831 --> 12:33.560
And I can't remember all, kid.

12:33.677 --> 12:35.847
She was found on the back seat of a car.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.173
This hourglass was next to her.

12:38.243 --> 12:41.393
Prints came up, Miguel Dominguez.
Ringing any bells?

12:41.627 --> 12:44.276
Truth be told, if you saw my name
on a police report,

12:44.277 --> 12:46.921
chances are I was out in that car,
asleep and worn-off.

12:47.001 --> 12:49.708
Your dad covered my ass
more times than I can remember.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.199
The evidence went missing.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.889
Pages from the murder book disappeared.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.831
- It happens.
- You know something!

12:55.832 --> 12:57.867
- Don't go there kid.
- Don't go where?

12:57.957 --> 13:00.569
- You're gonna hit an old man?
- What did you drag my father into?

13:00.570 --> 13:01.816
He came to me!

13:03.794 --> 13:04.757
What?

13:05.195 --> 13:06.289
Your dad and I

13:06.789 --> 13:08.957
were told to make the case go away.

13:09.112 --> 13:10.071
So we did.

13:10.897 --> 13:12.259
We looked the other way.

13:14.277 --> 13:15.279
You happy now?

13:28.960 --> 13:30.265
You know, I got your first mess.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.762
You didn't have to leave any more.

13:31.916 --> 13:34.172
I've got cops asking questions
about your book.

13:34.392 --> 13:35.947
In connection with the Garza murder.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.138
What are you gonna do about it?

13:37.139 --> 13:40.458
You know, apparently you're forgetting
how this works. You see, you owe me.

13:41.579 --> 13:45.089
When you owe somebody a big favor,
you don't ask the questions.

13:45.451 --> 13:46.468
I'm warning you.

13:47.332 --> 13:49.266
Regardless what happened between us
in the past,

13:49.284 --> 13:51.133
I do not respond well to threats.

13:52.553 --> 13:54.962
Let's just hope you have more control
over yourself

13:54.963 --> 13:56.931
than you did
that pretty little wife of yours.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.545
You know, maybe I ought
to pay her a visit.

14:00.116 --> 14:02.280
Just still live over there
in what was it, Fairfax?

14:22.588 --> 14:24.312
What? Are you crazy? I'm a cop!

14:31.282 --> 14:33.532
Cop or not, I still own your ass.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.899
Good luck getting the murder book now!

14:48.921 --> 14:51.343
Randall, it's me. I'm home.

14:51.897 --> 14:53.130
I don't see your car.

15:03.492 --> 15:04.458
Hello ?

15:04.679 --> 15:05.649
<i>Press play.</i>

15:17.252 --> 15:18.249
<i>Daddy!</i>

15:18.390 --> 15:19.875
<i>Where are you?</i>

15:20.077 --> 15:21.037
<i>Daddy!</i>

15:21.037 --> 15:23.551
<i>It's gonna be okay, guys.
Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

15:24.588 --> 15:25.552
<i>Jen...</i>

15:26.238 --> 15:27.698
<i>You need to do something.</i>

15:32.400 --> 15:33.300
+

15:33.579 --> 15:36.094
No, they're ex-L.A. county deputies, yeah.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.522
All right, thanks.

15:38.011 --> 15:40.353
Yeah, it's Battle.
I'm sending you an e-mail.

15:40.354 --> 15:41.397
Yeah? Battle.

15:41.773 --> 15:42.987
I'm sending you an e-mail.

15:43.194 --> 15:44.332
Did you check the records?

15:45.199 --> 15:46.197
All right, thanks.

15:53.344 --> 15:54.683
Con name's Fencik?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.837
How about the other one?

15:58.349 --> 15:59.322
Spell it.

15:59.671 --> 16:02.131
Buchalter. Thank you.

16:06.719 --> 16:07.695
My office!

16:08.809 --> 16:09.774
Now!

16:17.112 --> 16:19.003
I wanna know why you're looking
into these guys.

16:19.004 --> 16:20.974
And don't gimme that crap
about it being personal.

16:20.997 --> 16:21.965
I told you.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.056
It has to do with Garza.

16:23.081 --> 16:24.623
Hopper put you up to this, didn't he?

16:24.666 --> 16:25.725
Hopper's a fugitive.

16:26.966 --> 16:29.519
If he had contacted me,
I would've informed my lieutenant.

16:30.518 --> 16:31.919
So... tell me something.

16:32.537 --> 16:33.683
How does the other guy look?

16:34.118 --> 16:36.950
You're acting petty cocky
for someone with so many secrets.

16:37.447 --> 16:40.031
Paying off drug dealers
to cover up for a dirty habit.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.336
Well, we all have secrets.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.004
I'm more than willing
to face up to mine.

16:45.708 --> 16:46.670
Are you?

16:48.592 --> 16:49.820
These guys're friends of yours?

16:50.929 --> 16:53.022
You tread into dangerous ground,
detective.

16:53.064 --> 16:54.634
Because if they're involved in a murder,

16:54.652 --> 16:56.513
you should probably talk
to robbery homicide.

16:56.619 --> 16:58.385
Last I checked, you worked narcotics.

17:00.172 --> 17:01.564
Why don't you go back down there?

17:03.691 --> 17:05.104
He was a good man, your dad.

17:05.449 --> 17:06.577
Always had my back.

17:07.957 --> 17:09.203
He had great instincts.

17:09.347 --> 17:10.319
He taught me a lot.

17:12.488 --> 17:13.842
He helped me get sober.

17:15.239 --> 17:16.792
I owed him my life.

17:18.175 --> 17:19.462
So, understand...

17:19.657 --> 17:21.030
if he told me to do something,

17:22.040 --> 17:24.266
- I did it.
- So <i>he</i> made you a dirty cop.

17:24.324 --> 17:25.630
We weren't dirty.

17:26.202 --> 17:28.383
You know what it's like out there,
it's a numbers game.

17:28.409 --> 17:31.299
Sometimes you gotta let one go
so you can clear ten others.

17:31.352 --> 17:32.618
It's survival.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.939
I never had to turn my head
to survive.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.398
You're in narcotics.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.167
What about all the crap
you let your informants get away with

17:39.186 --> 17:40.696
just so you can keep using'em?

17:45.081 --> 17:46.042
No, huh?

17:47.231 --> 17:49.087
I guess you're above all that.

17:53.642 --> 17:55.177
That hourglass you got...

17:56.069 --> 17:57.836
You say Garza sent it to you?

17:58.461 --> 17:59.834
And he sent a picture to Jen.

17:59.941 --> 18:02.755
Garza was a prosecutor
your dad went to with this stuff.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.487
My father knew Garza?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.502
That Jane Doe case...

18:07.734 --> 18:09.997
Your dad thought he had a suspect.
This Dominguez guy?

18:10.749 --> 18:13.206
Trouble was he was locked up
in Pelican Bay at the time.

18:13.264 --> 18:15.759
But your dad went to Garza
with the case anyway.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.598
So if he went to a prosecutor,
he had to have something solid.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.576
All I remember is
he called in the morning, excited.

18:22.466 --> 18:23.447
But then that night...

18:23.844 --> 18:24.804
he comes to me...

18:25.245 --> 18:26.218
scared.

18:26.435 --> 18:27.453
Like I'd never seen him.

18:27.947 --> 18:29.427
He says the all thing's finished.

18:29.852 --> 18:32.482
Whatever he found must have freaked out
some higher ops.

18:32.483 --> 18:33.783
Higher ops how do you mean?

18:33.828 --> 18:36.859
You saw the murder book on this thing.
It's like Swiss cheese.

18:37.079 --> 18:39.186
No autopsy reports, no evidence logs.

18:39.213 --> 18:41.244
All our original notes from the scene
rewritten.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.030
You know what it takes to pull that off?

18:43.164 --> 18:46.156
I don't know who gave the order
to clean the house on this,

18:46.184 --> 18:48.259
but it was somebody way over
our pay grade.

18:48.304 --> 18:50.421
You think my father
gave over his notes?

18:51.350 --> 18:53.259
Your dad was a dog with a bone.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.344
If he kept that stuff,

18:56.188 --> 18:57.494
I wouldn't be surprised.

18:57.581 --> 18:59.897
So then somebody had to take them
from storage.

18:59.967 --> 19:01.240
If you think it was me...

19:01.306 --> 19:03.255
be my guest. Search the place.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.658
But if you ask me...

19:05.811 --> 19:06.838
cop to cop...

19:07.972 --> 19:08.934
your mom...

19:09.156 --> 19:10.119
your sister...

19:11.274 --> 19:12.671
One of them is holding out on you.

19:22.340 --> 19:23.308
Thank you.

19:57.110 --> 19:59.124
<i>This is Jen, please leave me a message.</i>

19:59.674 --> 20:00.633
Jen, it's Brett.

20:01.068 --> 20:02.041
Where the hell are you?

20:02.575 --> 20:05.645
I hope you understand
how serious this is.

20:07.519 --> 20:08.494
Please,

20:09.200 --> 20:10.847
this is everything you asked for.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.632
Take it.

20:14.262 --> 20:16.321
And just give me my family back.

20:20.165 --> 20:21.860
That's all that's left.

20:22.319 --> 20:23.933
I don't know what else to do.

20:30.692 --> 20:31.813
We got a problem.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.013
What happened to you?

20:39.206 --> 20:40.166
A cop.

20:40.344 --> 20:41.310
Which one?

20:41.378 --> 20:42.345
Shelten.

20:43.398 --> 20:44.828
He went for the murder book.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.459
He came back with all sorts
of question about Garza.

20:48.757 --> 20:49.965
I want to take him out.

20:52.664 --> 20:54.399
I like what you did with Shelten.

20:55.783 --> 20:57.534
You owned him, you knew his secrets.

20:57.535 --> 21:00.232
Secrets are only good
if a man's afraid they'll get out.

21:00.812 --> 21:02.739
We might have passed that point
with him.

21:06.066 --> 21:08.738
I think we can kill two birds
with one stone here.

21:09.719 --> 21:11.191
Just get the murder book.

21:13.344 --> 21:15.123
I'll handle the girl in the car.

21:18.540 --> 21:19.170
+

21:20.084 --> 21:22.046
No, they should have come
to the emergency room.

21:22.116 --> 21:24.043
A little boy with an asthma attack.

21:25.007 --> 21:26.377
James Mathis.

21:26.616 --> 21:27.592
I'm trying to find James.

21:27.890 --> 21:28.856
Ok, thank you.

21:28.875 --> 21:30.680
No, no, there's nothing up to...

21:34.432 --> 21:35.442
Holy crap.

21:37.410 --> 21:38.461
<i>For every decision,</i>

21:39.582 --> 21:40.955
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

21:46.661 --> 21:47.632
<i>Daddy!</i>

21:47.843 --> 21:49.209
<i>Where are you?</i>

21:49.525 --> 21:50.506
<i>Daddy!</i>

21:50.751 --> 21:53.334
<i>It's gonna be OK, guys!
Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

21:54.332 --> 21:55.296
<i>Jen,</i>

21:56.015 --> 21:57.538
<i>you need to do something.</i>

21:58.659 --> 22:01.076
<i>You know what they want.</i>

22:01.970 --> 22:03.280
<i>You have to get it.</i>

22:14.511 --> 22:16.044
Andrea, I can't talk right now.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.340
Listen, Hopper,
I've got some info
about those guys on the photo.

22:20.484 --> 22:21.693
Fencik and Buchalter.

22:22.381 --> 22:23.897
Wait, Fencik and Buchalter?

22:23.898 --> 22:24.763
It's their names?

22:24.764 --> 22:27.141
<i>Yeah, I got their names and numbers
from a friend at county.</i>

22:27.142 --> 22:29.187
But here's the crazy part:
I think Chad knows them.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.535
- What?
- Yeah, I showed him the photo today

22:31.535 --> 22:33.040
and he's been acting weird ever since.

22:33.161 --> 22:35.150
Hold on. Where are you?

22:35.312 --> 22:38.114
Following Chad, he just stopped
at an ATM machine.

22:38.798 --> 22:39.764
Olympic and Hope.

22:40.453 --> 22:41.819
Olympic and Hope?

22:42.727 --> 22:45.267
<i>He was gunned down at an ATM
on Olympic and Hope.</i>

22:47.054 --> 22:49.241
Andrea, you've got to get to Chad
immediately, right now!

22:49.296 --> 22:50.264
Hopper, hold on.

22:50.828 --> 22:51.826
I think someone's coming.

22:51.844 --> 22:53.750
<i>Forget about that.
You need to get to Chad now!</i>

22:53.769 --> 22:54.557
<i>He's in danger!</i>

22:54.558 --> 22:56.139
Andrea, listen to me!

22:56.274 --> 22:57.628
<i>You need to get to Chad now!</i>

22:57.698 --> 22:59.257
Hopper, wait. Your sister's here.

23:00.076 --> 23:01.039
Jen is there?

23:01.372 --> 23:02.340
I gotta go.

23:03.451 --> 23:04.504
I call you tomorrow.

23:04.568 --> 23:05.830
Ok, bye Mom.

23:07.883 --> 23:08.850
What are you doing here?

23:09.766 --> 23:11.010
Oh God, she's got a gun!

23:11.062 --> 23:12.021
<i>What?</i>

23:14.121 --> 23:15.149
Drop it, Jen!

23:15.482 --> 23:16.444
I can't!

23:16.461 --> 23:17.549
What the hell is going on?

23:17.550 --> 23:18.600
Put your gun down!

23:18.845 --> 23:19.862
Don't do this, Jen.

23:19.913 --> 23:21.085
They're gonna kill them!

23:21.086 --> 23:22.103
What is she talking about?

23:22.104 --> 23:22.994
Put your gun down!

23:22.995 --> 23:23.806
They made me do this.

23:23.807 --> 23:24.822
Made you do what?

23:25.033 --> 23:26.000
What are you doing?

23:26.617 --> 23:27.695
They made me do it!

23:27.958 --> 23:28.922
Just calm down.

23:28.923 --> 23:30.265
Come on, let's talk about this.

23:31.229 --> 23:33.260
- Put the gun down, now.
- We'll help you!

23:37.651 --> 23:38.686
I'm so sorry.

23:51.005 --> 23:51.976
Battle!

23:52.622 --> 23:53.612
Call 911!

23:57.608 --> 23:59.032
This is detective Battle,

23:59.909 --> 24:02.586
I need an ambulance at the intersection
of Olympic and Hope.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.456
<i>For every decision</i>

24:16.985 --> 24:18.259

24:18.729 --> 24:20.321

<i>Where is the package?
What did you do with it?</i>

24:30.980 --> 24:32.933
<i>- I don't know anything...
- I don't believe you!</i>

24:32.934 --> 24:33.870
<i>...consequences.</i>

24:33.871 --> 24:34.866

24:36.151 --> 24:37.382
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

24:37.383 --> 24:40.805
<i>Look, I'm sorry if I don't have time
for the perfect family...</i>

24:41.352 --> 24:44.433
<i>It's not about being perfect!
It is about being there!</i>

24:53.106 --> 24:54.076
She didn't.

25:00.761 --> 25:02.032
<i>For every decision,</i>

25:03.094 --> 25:04.352
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

25:26.938 --> 25:28.000
Everybody dies.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.316
I can't stop it.

25:39.086 --> 25:40.108
You can't.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.136
Brett, you gotta go. You gotta go.

25:49.406 --> 25:50.874
There are cops everywhere.

25:51.137 --> 25:52.172
You gotta go now.

25:52.395 --> 25:54.138
They'll catch you if you stay.

26:28.106 --> 26:29.626
Brett, what are you doing?

26:36.870 --> 26:37.860
+

26:41.057 --> 26:42.709
- You're OK.
- What...is it?

26:43.757 --> 26:47.008
- Is it Mom?
- No, it's not Mom, it's you.

26:48.017 --> 26:48.987
We need to talk.

26:50.127 --> 26:51.524
- Now?
- Yeah, right now.

26:54.509 --> 26:58.690
- Brett, this isn't really a good time.
- Jen, you can't keep avoiding me.

26:59.522 --> 27:01.724
I don't hear from you for weeks

27:01.907 --> 27:05.767
and you come to my house, and you act
like I'm the one avoiding you?

27:05.768 --> 27:08.258
- What is that?
- I know about the photo in the shed.

27:08.349 --> 27:09.949
And the bruises on your arms.

27:10.277 --> 27:12.649
- How do you know that?
- It doesn't matter how I know.

27:14.117 --> 27:16.228
You have to tell me what's happening.

27:17.030 --> 27:19.507
- You wouldn't understand.
- It's not gonna end well

27:19.508 --> 27:21.658
if you don't tell me what's going on.

27:21.854 --> 27:22.863
Now Jenny, please.

27:23.492 --> 27:24.489
Just let me in.

27:25.248 --> 27:26.218
There...

27:26.532 --> 27:27.909
- These men.
- OK.

27:28.996 --> 27:30.477
They came to me...

27:32.436 --> 27:33.420
And...

27:33.721 --> 27:35.202
- I took care of it.
- No.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.234
Tell me what these men wanted.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.381
Nothing... Junk, Dad's old stuff.

27:40.472 --> 27:42.621
No, they didn't find
what they were looking for.

27:42.622 --> 27:44.824
And they're gonna come back,
unless you give it to them.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.695
- How could you possibly know that?
- Jen, just tell me what they want.

27:48.786 --> 27:49.966
Okay? Please...

27:52.128 --> 27:53.675
You wanna check on the kids?

27:58.274 --> 27:59.837
What the hell are you doing here, Brett?

27:59.838 --> 28:01.018
Are you a part of this?

28:03.083 --> 28:05.299
- Do you know what's going on?
- Do you?

28:05.973 --> 28:08.267
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

28:08.268 --> 28:09.866
Believe me, I do. Now just get this...

28:09.867 --> 28:12.548
Do you think you can do worst to me
than they've already done, Brett?

28:12.553 --> 28:13.523
They hurt her!

28:16.689 --> 28:18.773
Do you think that doesn't... kill me?

28:19.101 --> 28:21.055
Do you think I'm just okay with that?

28:22.064 --> 28:25.393
Now you probably think I should just
march out there and shut them, right?

28:25.394 --> 28:27.155
Yeah, that's what you would've done!

28:27.156 --> 28:29.122
But I can't be that guy, Brett.

28:29.738 --> 28:31.115
Because I have a family.

28:31.246 --> 28:33.670
You don't understand the danger
that you're in.

28:33.671 --> 28:36.187
We took care of it, okay? It's done!

28:36.188 --> 28:37.157
It's not done!

28:40.667 --> 28:42.514
Okay, I don't care if you hate me,

28:42.515 --> 28:44.520
so long as you believe me
when I tell you

28:44.521 --> 28:46.763
that they will kill you, Jennifer

28:47.090 --> 28:49.521
and all of your children,
like it's nothing!

28:49.560 --> 28:50.595
I have seen it!

28:51.866 --> 28:53.668
Now whatever it is you didn't give them,

28:53.669 --> 28:55.012
Jen and I have to get...

28:55.448 --> 28:56.413
Today.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.457
We have to get it now, Randall!

28:59.457 --> 29:00.729
We have to get it now.

29:04.358 --> 29:05.637
I'm trusting you here.

29:05.912 --> 29:06.908
I know.

29:11.230 --> 29:13.747
I've told you.
I have no idea where Brett is.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.993
What about your wife?
Any idea where we can find her?

29:16.132 --> 29:18.282
She's... taking the kids to school.

29:18.832 --> 29:19.802
If she shows up...

29:20.452 --> 29:21.423
Have her call me.

29:27.203 --> 29:29.679
Let me know when she does,
she could be in danger.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.651
Danger?

29:31.629 --> 29:34.107
What are you talking about?
I mean... You mean Brett?

29:34.486 --> 29:35.476
He would never...

29:35.530 --> 29:38.733
You'd be surprised what people can do
when they're desperate.

29:39.153 --> 29:40.149
If I were you,

29:40.626 --> 29:43.007
I did your kids go home where it's safe.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.623
I'll send a patrol of cop by later
to check on you.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.511
I don't understand, it's money.

30:21.398 --> 30:24.230
Like...What's here,
seven-eight thousand dollars?

30:24.518 --> 30:25.764
There used to be more.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.410
How much more?

30:29.685 --> 30:30.694
Maybe...

30:31.062 --> 30:32.031
A hundred...

30:32.444 --> 30:33.406
Thousand.

30:34.550 --> 30:35.610
So you took it?

30:35.782 --> 30:36.869
We needed it.

30:38.009 --> 30:39.516
We're having another baby!

30:39.870 --> 30:41.908
Randall was out of work,
we had a mortgage to pay.

30:41.909 --> 30:44.151
You put your family in jeopardy
for a couple of days off

30:44.151 --> 30:45.402
and some new curtains?

30:45.500 --> 30:47.964
That was Dad's dirty money.

30:49.399 --> 30:53.108
- What do you want? Your shares?
- It's not about the money, Jen!

30:53.383 --> 30:54.393
You weren't there.

30:55.851 --> 30:57.424
Dad shot himself!

30:59.167 --> 31:01.277
Who do you think dealt with the body?

31:01.631 --> 31:04.213
Who do you think made
funeral arrangements?

31:04.214 --> 31:06.783
Did you think the coroner
cleaned up the blood?

31:11.002 --> 31:12.554
What's sure is that it wasn't you.

31:15.314 --> 31:18.610
You wanna know where I was
when I got the call about Dad?

31:19.291 --> 31:20.275
Under cover.

31:21.369 --> 31:24.489
Surrounded by a bunch of low life scum
who were gonna blow up my brains

31:24.490 --> 31:25.471
if they knew I was a cop!

31:25.472 --> 31:28.028
I don't care where you were
when you found out!

31:28.830 --> 31:31.124
- But where you were after?
- I was doing my job.

31:31.125 --> 31:33.863
- That's what Dad would have wanted!
- Dad was dead!

31:33.916 --> 31:36.064
Well, we weren't
and you just disappeared!

31:36.065 --> 31:37.553
You never called for help!

31:37.554 --> 31:39.349
Why didn't you call me for help?

31:39.715 --> 31:41.368
Our father kills himself.

31:41.996 --> 31:43.386
And I have to ask?

31:44.028 --> 31:45.352
You were his son!

31:46.931 --> 31:48.938
You're not gonna drag me into this, Jen.

31:48.977 --> 31:50.904
You're not gonna drag me into this.

31:51.054 --> 31:52.312
This doesn't make sense.

31:53.584 --> 31:55.537
Why would this people
shake down a school teacher

31:55.538 --> 31:58.140
- for a hundred thousand dollars?
- OK, stop it!

31:58.467 --> 32:02.431
Could you for once stop being a cop
and just be my brother?

32:05.173 --> 32:06.156
Could you do that?

32:08.686 --> 32:09.657
Could you?

32:26.894 --> 32:28.913
I never stopped being your brother.

32:34.380 --> 32:35.559
I don't understand...

32:37.556 --> 32:38.657
...why he did it.

32:39.850 --> 32:42.931
- Why he left this on me.
- He didn't leave this on you.

32:44.032 --> 32:45.000
I did.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.335
But I'm here now.

32:49.326 --> 32:50.847
And I'm not going anywhere.

32:52.419 --> 32:53.599
I spent the money.

32:55.198 --> 32:57.675
- I don't...
- So we'll give them what we have.

32:58.830 --> 33:00.167
If they don't like it...

33:00.862 --> 33:02.208
they're gonna have to deal with me.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.775
Hopper's sister wasn't at school
so I spoke to the husband.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.820
The guy was nervous.
Tell you, he's hiding something.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.551
Some people just don't like cops.

33:10.648 --> 33:12.517
I wouldn't be surprised
his sister's in on it.

33:12.518 --> 33:14.115
The apple doesn't fall far of that tree.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.138
- What are you talking about?
-The old man,

33:16.139 --> 33:18.474
I worked for him for five years,
the guy was dirty.

33:18.525 --> 33:19.496
I never of heard that.

33:19.954 --> 33:22.471
You were in high school.
Everyone knew he was on the take.

33:22.558 --> 33:24.066
Well, so you saw this or you heard?

33:24.078 --> 33:27.637
The guy is at department, at D3
with 25 years in, set for life,

33:27.690 --> 33:28.882
then he eats a bullet?

33:28.974 --> 33:30.954
Sounds like someone
with a clean conscience to you?

33:30.955 --> 33:32.546
- That sounds like a shame.
- A shame?

33:33.608 --> 33:35.852
The guy takes the easy way out
and everyone here clears

33:35.853 --> 33:37.372
so the family'll get the pension.

33:37.373 --> 33:38.788
So what? The guy was a cop.

33:38.914 --> 33:41.761
- And you look out for blood?
- What is your problem?

33:41.762 --> 33:44.427
The guy was dirty,
he doesn't deserve anything.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.225
What have you got against Hopper's dad?

33:48.351 --> 33:52.061
Look, the only Hopper that I care about
put three bullets in Alberto Garza.

33:58.243 --> 33:59.931
What is this? Are these those...

33:59.932 --> 34:01.034
Keep the case in the car.

34:01.035 --> 34:03.240
- What is going on?
- Stay in the car.

34:19.866 --> 34:20.830
My children!

34:21.290 --> 34:23.702
- Where are they?
- They're inside, they're fine.

34:23.703 --> 34:24.701
They're fine.

34:26.425 --> 34:29.503
Jen, these men...
they want the briefcase.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.813
Give them the briefcase, Jen.

34:33.380 --> 34:34.351
Please...

34:39.989 --> 34:40.980
+

34:44.911 --> 34:47.482
- You have to give it to them.
- I got what you want.

34:47.534 --> 34:49.264
I'll give it to you. Nobody gets hurt.

34:49.395 --> 34:50.588
Jen, go get the case.

35:01.477 --> 35:02.892
Everything's gonna be okay.

35:03.006 --> 35:04.081
I'm gonna fix this.

35:06.047 --> 35:07.016
Take it!

35:42.851 --> 35:43.860
Are we good?

35:45.780 --> 35:46.750
We're good.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.876
Oh my God!

36:04.505 --> 36:05.751
Oh my God, you guys...

36:15.844 --> 36:18.177
Come here, come here...

36:39.951 --> 36:40.947
I'm sorry, Jen.

36:43.692 --> 36:44.663
I'm so sorry.

37:05.831 --> 37:09.475
James has just said that he wants
to go to school barefoot.

37:12.527 --> 37:13.497
You okay?

37:15.463 --> 37:16.447
I don't know.

37:16.866 --> 37:18.792
Honey, everything's gonna be fine.

37:18.793 --> 37:21.532
- We can get through this.
- No... It's not that.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.585
I feel...

37:26.611 --> 37:27.594
different.

37:27.634 --> 37:29.325
Different? What do you mean?

37:31.803 --> 37:33.454
I don't know, I just feel it.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.083
Things are gonna be different today.

37:37.028 --> 37:38.628
Aren't they different every day?

37:38.641 --> 37:41.354
I can understand you're scared.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.604
But we can handle this.

37:45.247 --> 37:46.440
I'm gonna call Brett.

37:46.583 --> 37:48.589
Are we talking about the same Brett?

37:49.383 --> 37:53.118
Jen, you're the one who's always saying
we can't count on him for anything!

37:53.119 --> 37:54.718
That was our father's money.

37:55.465 --> 37:56.579
I have to tell him.

37:57.903 --> 37:58.900
He's my brother.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.700
I'm so terrified.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.440
What if these men wanted the money...

38:05.785 --> 38:06.748
and I spent it?

38:09.109 --> 38:12.019
When I woke up this morning though,
I had a thought.

38:12.216 --> 38:14.327
These men, they don't seem
like they need money.

38:14.328 --> 38:15.550
I was thinking the same thing.

38:15.551 --> 38:17.888
So if they don't want the money,
then what?

38:31.580 --> 38:33.834
- Well, the lining's different.
- So?

38:42.585 --> 38:43.581
What is that?

38:46.884 --> 38:48.366
It's an autopsy report.

38:55.612 --> 38:57.801
Who is Isabella Contreras?

38:57.893 --> 39:00.829
She's a girl that was killed.
And he wanted to find out about it.

39:03.358 --> 39:04.322
Oh God.

39:04.374 --> 39:05.528
What does that mean?

39:05.659 --> 39:08.949
- When she died, she was pregnant.
- Those men wanted this?

39:09.477 --> 39:10.867
What am I supposed to do?

39:12.558 --> 39:14.708
- You're gonna give it to them.
- They came to me.

39:14.709 --> 39:17.847
- How am I supposed to reach them?
- You're gonna call this number.

39:17.886 --> 39:20.416
You're gonna ask
for Fencik or Buchalter.

39:20.501 --> 39:21.720
You're gonna say who you are

39:21.721 --> 39:24.828
and you're gonna tell them
that you have what they want.

39:27.088 --> 39:29.290
How could you possibly know
those people?

39:29.579 --> 39:31.689
Andrea managed to track them down
for me yesterday.

39:31.690 --> 39:34.526
So this is all... they wanted from me?

39:37.356 --> 39:38.968
Isn't this Dad's handwriting?

39:42.192 --> 39:44.211
- Yeah, it is.
- What does it mean?

39:45.167 --> 39:47.553
I don't know.
I only recognize these two names.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.498
So who's Tobias Booth?

39:52.966 --> 39:54.197
...and as your councilman,

39:54.303 --> 39:57.032
I promise to continue
Alberto Garza's effort.

39:57.033 --> 40:00.958
He would have wanted us to remember
that hope is bigger than anyone of us.

40:01.514 --> 40:04.528
And like his memory, it will carry on.

40:05.131 --> 40:06.730
As Alberto used to say,

40:07.608 --> 40:08.802
you cannot kill hope...

40:09.391 --> 40:10.374
with a bullet.

40:11.324 --> 40:12.517
I'd like to...

40:12.700 --> 40:13.749
Put it all down.

40:14.603 --> 40:16.110
The captain wants the book...

40:16.988 --> 40:17.998
the gang leader...

40:18.889 --> 40:19.859
Hopper.
