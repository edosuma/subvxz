- Well, thank you.
It was great.

09:17.322 --> 09:18.423
- This is truly a dream
come true.

09:18.456 --> 09:20.025
- Oh, you were amazing.

09:20.058 --> 09:22.427
Thank you, John Fitzsimmons.
- Thank you.

09:22.461 --> 09:23.596
Thank you.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.231
[cheers and applause]

09:27.799 --> 09:28.833
- Stick around.

09:28.868 --> 09:31.037
More "Fool Us" coming up
after the break.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.139
[cheers and applause]

09:38.911 --> 09:41.113
[jazz music]

09:41.147 --> 09:43.950
[cheers and applause]

09:43.982 --> 09:45.451
- Welcome back to "Fool Us,"

09:45.484 --> 09:48.486
where playing cards
are never used for blackjack.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.956
Let's see if a "Fool Us" trophy
is in the cards

09:50.990 --> 09:52.191
for our next magician.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.296
- When my son Matthew
was one year old,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.398
he was diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes,

09:59.432 --> 10:02.033
and that opens up your eyes
quite a bit.

10:02.067 --> 10:04.003
Ten years later,
he's doing great,

10:04.035 --> 10:05.638
but I still try
to use my magic

10:05.671 --> 10:07.673
to help raise money
and spread awareness

10:07.706 --> 10:10.509
of type 1 diabetes
through different foundations.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.144
- Oh, my God!

10:12.177 --> 10:14.513
- People ask me
if I can support

10:14.547 --> 10:17.216
a family of four
on a magician's salary.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.184
Well, they don't
say it like that.

10:19.217 --> 10:21.187
They say,
"Oh, you're a magician.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.822
Do you have a real job?"

10:22.855 --> 10:23.822
- Oh, my God.

10:23.855 --> 10:25.191
- And I do have a real job.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.591
I'm in show business.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.592
- Come on!

10:27.626 --> 10:29.227
- Magic is the show,

10:29.260 --> 10:31.831
and marketing is my business.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.265
Magic and marketing
have a lot in common.

10:34.299 --> 10:36.601
In both cases,
I'm using psychology

10:36.635 --> 10:39.205
to try to get people
to do what I want.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.740
Tonight, I'm gonna be using

10:40.773 --> 10:43.609
a very powerful
psychological technique.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.010
[bell dings]

10:45.043 --> 10:47.879
Let's see if it works
on Penn and Teller.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.548
[cheers and applause]

10:50.582 --> 10:55.120
- Joined by Penn and Teller,
here's David Corsaro.

10:55.153 --> 10:56.389
[cheers and applause]

10:56.422 --> 10:57.923
- Thank you.

10:57.956 --> 10:59.290
You know, as a magician,

10:59.325 --> 11:01.826
I'm constantly looking
for new ways to influence

11:01.860 --> 11:03.863
what people say
and what they do.

11:03.895 --> 11:06.499
And recently,
my research has led me to--

11:06.532 --> 11:08.900
you guessed it--
Ivan Pavlov.

11:08.933 --> 11:10.001
- [laughs]

11:10.035 --> 11:11.236
- Now, hopefully
for some of you,

11:11.269 --> 11:13.239
that name rings a bell.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.341
[laughter]
Let me explain.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.642
If you believe the saying

11:16.676 --> 11:18.744
that you can't teach
an old dog new tricks,

11:18.778 --> 11:20.546
then Ivan Pavlov

11:20.578 --> 11:22.748
was one of the greatest
magic teachers of all time,

11:22.782 --> 11:25.817
because he discovered that you
could train a dog to salivate

11:25.850 --> 11:27.153
just by ringing a bell.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.386
That's right.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.654
Every time he rang a bell...

11:29.688 --> 11:32.224
[bell rings]
His dog drooled.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.159
So tonight,
I'm gonna to try to apply

11:34.192 --> 11:39.097
that same scientific technique
to the Great Danes of magic,

11:39.130 --> 11:42.368
Penn and Teller,
but not to make you drool.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.703
But hopefully
to make you fooled.

11:44.736 --> 11:45.705
- Hmm.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.373
- Let me explain.

11:47.405 --> 11:49.174
As part of my journey
to try to fool...

11:49.207 --> 11:50.042
[bell rings]
Penn and Teller,

11:50.076 --> 11:51.443
I decided to study

11:51.476 --> 11:52.544
all of the foolers...
[bell rings]

11:52.577 --> 11:54.212
From the past and see

11:54.245 --> 11:56.215
if there was a common
denominator of things

11:56.248 --> 11:57.950
that successfully fooled...

11:57.982 --> 11:59.051
[bell rings]
Penn and Teller

11:59.085 --> 12:00.385
and things
that didn't fool...

12:00.418 --> 12:01.486
[bell rings]
Them.

12:01.519 --> 12:03.221
I even went back and watched

12:03.254 --> 12:05.557
all of the past episodes
of "Fool"...

12:05.591 --> 12:06.792
[bell rings]
"Us"

12:06.826 --> 12:09.562
and made a list
of the words and phrases

12:09.595 --> 12:13.466
that Penn had used most often
every time he was describing

12:13.499 --> 12:15.067
a successful a fooler.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.335
[bell rings]
Now, you can see the words

12:16.368 --> 12:18.203
come in all different shapes
and sizes.

12:18.236 --> 12:20.572
Good, creative, confident,
comfortable, smart,

12:20.605 --> 12:24.844
strong, powerful, cool,
clever, unique, exciting.

12:24.876 --> 12:26.644
I even put the word
that Teller used most often.

12:26.678 --> 12:28.346
- Mm.
- [laughs]

12:28.379 --> 12:29.548
- So, Penn, Teller, Alyson,
if the three of you

12:29.581 --> 12:31.149
would please indulge me
for a moment.

12:31.182 --> 12:33.152
Just pick the word
that you think

12:33.184 --> 12:34.986
all successful foolers...

12:35.019 --> 12:36.388
[bell rings]
Should be.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.523
Penn, what do you think?

12:37.556 --> 12:40.225
- Powerful.
- Powerful, powerful.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.695
Okay. Teller.
You wanna just point to one?

12:42.727 --> 12:45.197
- [laughs]

12:45.230 --> 12:48.033
- Clever.
Powerful and clever. Alyson?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.701
- Can I point
to Teller's word?

12:49.735 --> 12:50.870
- You can point
to Teller's word.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.370
Do you want to just do
Teller's word?

12:52.403 --> 12:54.105
- Uh, I'll do creative.
- It's up to you.

12:54.139 --> 12:56.575
Okay.
Powerful, clever, and creative.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.009
Yes.
Powerful, clever, and creative.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.544
Perfect.

12:59.577 --> 13:01.279
Let me just actually
erase all of these words

13:01.312 --> 13:02.847
so that nobody
changes their mind

13:02.881 --> 13:05.049
or gets confused
or anything like that.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.451
[laughter]

13:06.485 --> 13:09.721
Oh, a little David Corsaro
subliminal messaging

13:09.754 --> 13:11.456
doesn't hurt either.

13:11.490 --> 13:12.792
But see, there's actually
another message

13:12.825 --> 13:14.393
that you created.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.996
There's a message hidden
inside this deck of cards.

13:18.029 --> 13:20.032
Let me spell it out for you.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.634
Literally.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.701
Your word was powerful.

13:23.735 --> 13:28.173
P-O-W-E-R-F-U-L.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.042
Your word was clever.

13:30.075 --> 13:33.077
C-L-E-V-E-R.

13:33.111 --> 13:34.746
And your word was?

13:34.779 --> 13:35.581
- Creative.
- Creative.

13:35.614 --> 13:40.451
C-R-E-A-T-I-V-E.

13:41.419 --> 13:43.721
Now, I should point out,
this is not a card trick,

13:43.755 --> 13:46.558
because this is not
a regular deck of cards.

13:46.591 --> 13:48.860
This deck of cards
actually contains the names

13:48.894 --> 13:51.831
of everybody who's ever
fooled Penn and Teller.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.600
We've got Paul Gertner,
Boris Wild,

13:54.633 --> 13:58.336
Chris Capehart, Helen Coghlan,
David Roth,

13:58.370 --> 13:59.904
Helen Coghlan again,
Helen Coghlan--

13:59.938 --> 14:01.105
well, she's in here a lot.

14:01.139 --> 14:03.509
[laughter]
Shawn Farquhar.

14:03.542 --> 14:07.011
But after doing all that
and spelling those names out,

14:07.046 --> 14:09.347
we have all the people who
have fooled Penn and Teller.

14:09.380 --> 14:10.481
And after we use

14:10.515 --> 14:12.283
the attributes
that you selected,

14:12.317 --> 14:14.385
we ended up on this person.

14:14.419 --> 14:17.222
Not this one
who was Doc Dixon,

14:17.255 --> 14:18.791
but this one.

14:18.823 --> 14:22.293
And if all of my
Pavlovian tomfoolery...

14:22.327 --> 14:23.962
[bell rings]
Worked,

14:23.995 --> 14:27.198
hopefully we can add my name,
David Corsaro,

14:27.232 --> 14:28.200
to the list.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.336
- [gasps] Oh, my...

14:30.369 --> 14:31.971
- Thank you very much, guys.
Appreciate it.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.173
- Thank you
- Thank you.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.908
- David Corsaro, everyone!

14:36.942 --> 14:39.411
[cheers and applause]

14:39.445 --> 14:42.047
Wow. That was so good.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.548
- Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

14:43.581 --> 14:45.551
- What does it mean to you
to be here tonight?

14:45.584 --> 14:48.052
- I wanted to just come
out here with something fun

14:48.086 --> 14:50.188
and also something
that sort of pays homage

14:50.221 --> 14:52.691
to all the past foolers.
- Definitely.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.659
And have you really watched
every single episode?

14:54.692 --> 14:56.828
- I did.
I literally transcribed

14:56.861 --> 14:58.764
every single thing
Penn had said

14:58.797 --> 15:01.133
and kept a tally sheet
of everything.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.768
If you ever want some
of your statistics as well,

15:02.801 --> 15:03.969
I might have those as well, I--

15:04.003 --> 15:05.703
- No, I certainly don't.
- I'm just saying.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.942
- I think
the easier the trick is,

15:09.975 --> 15:11.677
the harder it is
for them to figure out,

15:11.710 --> 15:15.447
because they are so smart
that they go to, like, "Okay,

15:15.480 --> 15:17.548
"so they moved the planet
and the da-duh-duh,

15:17.582 --> 15:19.018
and the history and the..."

15:19.051 --> 15:21.386
And then they're like,
"No, it was my watch."

15:21.419 --> 15:22.788
- Yeah. Planet moving
was one of the ways

15:22.821 --> 15:24.556
I was gonna consider
doing this,

15:24.590 --> 15:26.292
but I would actually
agree with you

15:26.325 --> 15:28.360
that if the method
behind your trick

15:28.394 --> 15:30.195
is extraordinarily clever,

15:30.229 --> 15:32.197
then you almost have
to come up with another way

15:32.230 --> 15:34.232
to maybe perhaps
lead them down that path.

15:34.265 --> 15:37.036
- All right, David, let's see
if your Pavlovian techniques

15:37.068 --> 15:39.304
earned you a trophy.

15:39.337 --> 15:40.306
- Hey, David.
- Hello.

15:40.338 --> 15:41.639
- Nice trick.
- Thank you.

15:41.673 --> 15:45.711
- I like Pavlovian ideas.
That's very good.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.578
You've always got our
attention when you do a joke

15:47.613 --> 15:51.250
about Helen Coghlan
fooling us all the time.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.418
In another two seasons,
you'd be able to do

15:53.451 --> 15:55.187
that whole trick
with just her name.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.056
- Just her name. Yeah.
- Yeah. Nobody else's name.

15:57.088 --> 15:58.356
Really, really good.

15:58.389 --> 16:02.094
We did not see you doing any--

16:02.126 --> 16:03.595
any card moves at all.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.029
We were burning you.

16:05.063 --> 16:06.831
Absolutely burning you,
and we didn't see

16:06.865 --> 16:10.302
any seconds or bottoms
or anything going on there.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.672
So we had to go down
another road,

16:13.706 --> 16:15.673
which is that list of words

16:15.707 --> 16:19.610
that so nicely spells
out your name when erasing.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.981
We couldn't help but notice
that many of those

16:23.014 --> 16:27.485
have the--the same--
the same number of letters.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.289
And we think maybe
you got a little bit lucky.

16:31.322 --> 16:33.024
Like, I picked a longer word,

16:33.057 --> 16:35.226
then Teller
picked a medium word.

16:35.259 --> 16:37.229
Then you were right there
for Alyson

16:37.261 --> 16:40.698
and that maybe if Teller
had picked a longer word, too,

16:40.732 --> 16:42.368
you would've had
to push Alyson on

16:42.400 --> 16:44.003
to one of the shorter words.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.303
But I think it all went
really smoothly.

16:45.336 --> 16:47.740
We all came out
kind of in the middle.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.841
We didn't have time to work out

16:49.875 --> 16:52.745
the number of letters
on everything,

16:52.778 --> 16:55.880
but we think that the trick
is not in the card handling,

16:55.913 --> 16:58.384
but rather in
the psychological handling

16:58.417 --> 16:59.717
of the words there.

16:59.751 --> 17:02.653
We--do you want more?
Are we close enough?

17:02.687 --> 17:05.023
Do you think that we've got
the basic idea?

17:05.057 --> 17:06.424
- Um...

17:06.458 --> 17:09.193
- David, does he know
how you did your trick?

17:09.228 --> 17:11.529
- He doesn't know
how I did the trick.

17:11.563 --> 17:14.032
- [squeals]
- It's not in the words at all?

17:14.066 --> 17:15.134
- It's not in the words at all.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.169
- Don't bust me
in the specifics.

17:17.201 --> 17:19.371
It's not in
the number of--it's...

17:19.404 --> 17:22.106
- [gasps]
- It's in the card handling.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.342
Ring--start ringing the bell.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.876
- Yay!
- Go ahead and ring the bell.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.011
[cheers and applause]

17:27.046 --> 17:30.315
- Fooler! Yay!

17:30.348 --> 17:31.650
- Thank you.

17:31.682 --> 17:35.653
- Congratulations.
Oh, my goodness.

17:35.686 --> 17:37.388
- Thank you so much.
- Yay!

17:37.423 --> 17:38.824
- Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

17:38.856 --> 17:42.027
- David Corsaro!

17:42.060 --> 17:45.096
[cheers and applause]

17:47.398 --> 17:50.169
Penn and Teller
just got dunked on.

17:50.201 --> 17:53.072

- This seems like such
a dangerous performance.

You must have so much trust
in one another.

25:11.809 --> 25:13.545
- Yes, a lot.

One time, I was taking Diego,
and...

To the floor.

- Oh, goodness.

25:27.992 --> 25:30.060
Let's see if you take home
a trophy.

25:31.496 --> 25:34.132
- Ah, Diego and Elena,
what a great act.

25:34.164 --> 25:35.500
You know, Teller said,

25:35.534 --> 25:37.801
"If they do a quick change
in the air,

25:37.836 --> 25:39.003
"this will be the greatest
quick change act

25:39.037 --> 25:40.572
I've ever seen."

25:40.605 --> 25:42.907
And there you did
a quick change act in the air.

25:42.941 --> 25:44.875
It was so good.

25:44.910 --> 25:49.213
You know, there's so much other
great stuff in the acrobatics

25:49.247 --> 25:52.317
that you might forget how much
really good and hard magic

25:52.349 --> 25:53.484
there is in there.

25:53.518 --> 25:56.320

the appearance of Elena,

25:56.354 --> 25:58.522
all of that stuff
is really beautiful

25:58.557 --> 26:01.026
and carefully choreographed
and wonderful magic.

26:01.058 --> 26:05.297
You know, we first
were thinking of this show.

26:05.329 --> 26:07.164
One of the things we considered

26:07.198 --> 26:09.166
was when someone came on,

26:09.200 --> 26:12.703
we would have to duplicate
the trick that they just did.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.272
I just wanna tell you,
if we had to do that,

26:15.307 --> 26:16.674
you won hands down.

26:18.143 --> 26:19.978
'Cause we would not
have a chance.

26:20.010 --> 26:25.784
Also, quick change acts
that are dealing with disrobing

26:25.817 --> 26:28.385
often are not that sexy.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.288
Not true for you.

26:30.321 --> 26:32.123
You just do a wonderful
quick change act

26:32.156 --> 26:33.892
with real magic in it,

26:33.924 --> 26:35.359
really astonishing,

26:35.393 --> 26:38.395
and really, really sexy
and wonderful.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.699

was just fabulous.

26:40.731 --> 26:43.067

in the air

26:43.101 --> 26:45.804
is just so beautiful
and so magical.

26:45.836 --> 26:48.539
And we could not do
one bit of it.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.307
But boy, we're glad you did,

26:50.342 --> 26:51.710

you fooled us,

our next magician.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.697
- My dad is a car dealer,

27:45.730 --> 27:47.731
and my brother
is a politician.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.535
So I guess you could say
deception runs in my family.

27:50.567 --> 27:52.503
I got hooked early as a kid.

27:52.537 --> 27:54.372
And when I discovered
I could fool my parents,

27:54.405 --> 27:56.407
well, I wanted
to keep doing that.

27:56.441 --> 27:59.911
I'm from Tupelo, Mississippi,
home of Elvis Presley.

27:59.943 --> 28:01.680
And it's a great place
to live,

28:01.712 --> 28:03.748

do sports.

in the corner

28:15.693 --> 28:18.462
over there
practicing my card tricks.

28:18.496 --> 28:19.431
But there's one thing
that's great

28:19.463 --> 28:20.664
about being a magician

28:20.699 --> 28:22.500
in a land
without many magicians.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.869
If you need a magician,
I'm one of the few.

28:25.903 --> 28:28.640
I've got a reputation as being
the nice guy of magic.

28:28.673 --> 28:31.476

against the bad boys of magic.

I was a little kid,

28:48.926 --> 28:51.730

I asked you to sign

29:01.806 --> 29:03.508
a $100 bill
and give it to Alyson.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.477

- Yes, I did.

show the camera,

are genuine.

So, Alyson, would you please
be my sidekick?

29:50.521 --> 29:53.157
I also have three fake bills.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.460
And to prove they're
100% real fakes,

29:55.492 --> 29:58.296
they have the word fake
written on them.

29:58.328 --> 30:00.030
Alyson, what I'd like you to do

30:00.064 --> 30:02.232
is to take these fake bills

30:02.267 --> 30:06.637
and put 'em in the envelopes
and seal them up.

30:06.671 --> 30:08.038
- Okay, I'm gonna have
to do that without my costume.

30:08.071 --> 30:09.039
- That's fine.
That's--

30:09.073 --> 30:10.508
- Thank you.

30:23.887 --> 30:25.690
- All right, two.

30:25.722 --> 30:26.990
- Now, Alyson, what I'd like
you to do is take those

30:35.465 --> 30:37.101
- Why am I doing all this?
You may ask.

30:37.134 --> 30:39.037
Well, that's because
I'm not really a superhero

Fire eating's a stunt.

as cold fire.

37:09.025 --> 37:11.329
Teller's coming out here
with a fireproof

37:11.362 --> 37:14.297
camping fuel container,
and it is lighter fluid

37:14.331 --> 37:16.032
that he's dipping
the torches in.

37:16.067 --> 37:20.972
The torches are cotton rope
wrapped around a metal rod

37:21.005 --> 37:23.039
screwed into a wooden handle.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.275
It's not the cotton that burns.

37:24.307 --> 37:26.177
It's the fuel that burns.

37:26.210 --> 37:28.378
And the way fire eating works
is this.

37:28.411 --> 37:30.681
You get a lot of moisture
throughout your mouth

37:30.715 --> 37:33.451
and all that moisture
has got to evaporate

37:33.483 --> 37:34.851
from any given part
of your mouth

37:34.885 --> 37:36.454
before that part will burn.

37:36.487 --> 37:39.155
So you learn how to handle
the burning vapors.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.324
Then you gotta try
to make it look good.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.693
Now, if you get a lot
of saliva in your mouth,

37:43.728 --> 37:47.331
and that's at least where
I try to keep most of mine,

37:47.364 --> 37:49.132
you can rub your lips
right on the cotton

37:49.166 --> 37:50.568
and pull that vapor off.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.503
The vapor's still burning,

37:52.536 --> 37:53.704
but if you breathe in
just a little bit,

37:53.737 --> 37:56.373
the audience can't see it.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.076
So you get
a beautiful surprise there.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.277
Then you just wait
till the time is right

38:00.311 --> 38:04.481
and then just let it flow
like it was magic smoke.

38:04.514 --> 38:07.684
If you wanna put the fire out,
there's a move for that too.

38:07.717 --> 38:11.155
And it's the move that
gives it the name fire eating.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.291
Now, you're not actually
eating the flame,

38:13.324 --> 38:16.427
but I guess they figure
that oral fire extinguishing

38:16.460 --> 38:18.161
didn't sound that butch.

38:18.195 --> 38:19.864
When you feel your mouth
drying out,

38:19.896 --> 38:21.632
you close your lips tightly.

38:21.666 --> 38:25.302
That cuts out most of
the oxygen and fire goes out.

38:25.335 --> 38:27.438
Now, when I
was being taught this,

38:27.471 --> 38:29.106
I got burned
every time I tried it,

38:29.139 --> 38:30.875
and I still
get burned occasionally.

38:30.907 --> 38:32.976
But the burns you get
from fire eating

38:33.010 --> 38:36.146
are for the most part
extremely minor.

38:36.179 --> 38:37.380
They're the kind of burns
you get, you know,

38:37.414 --> 38:39.516
when you eat a pizza too fast,

38:39.550 --> 38:42.619
the cheese will snag,
or you gulp some hot coffee.

38:42.652 --> 38:45.556
And I'm not talking
mind over matter jive.

38:45.588 --> 38:47.123
There's no such thing.

38:47.157 --> 38:48.958
It just hurts like holy hell,

38:48.992 --> 38:51.695
but it's not dangerous.

38:51.728 --> 38:53.230
The dangerous things

38:53.264 --> 38:55.333
that laypeople
hardly ever think about.

38:55.365 --> 38:57.168
And that is every time
you do this act,

38:57.201 --> 39:00.603
no matter how carefully
or how well,

39:00.637 --> 39:02.773
you swallow about a teaspoon
of the lighter fluid.

39:02.806 --> 39:04.342
And that stuff is poisonous.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.010
That's why they go
to the extra trouble

39:06.043 --> 39:08.478
to write "harmful or fatal
if swallowed"

39:08.512 --> 39:10.246
right there on the can.

39:10.280 --> 39:13.583
And the effect is
to a certain degree cumulative.

39:13.617 --> 39:16.420
Now, I say a certain degree.
I do four shows a week.

39:16.454 --> 39:19.356
I'm a big guy,
that doesn't affect me,

39:19.389 --> 39:23.994
but carnival workers
in real showbiz,

39:24.027 --> 39:26.463
they'll do
up to 30 shows a day.

39:26.496 --> 39:28.798
In as little
as two or three years,

39:28.833 --> 39:30.034
that stuff will build up
in their liver

39:30.067 --> 39:31.534
and they'll get sick enough

39:31.568 --> 39:32.936
they have to take time off

39:32.969 --> 39:34.938
and do another line of work

39:39.409 --> 39:42.112
Now, we take all this time

39:42.146 --> 39:45.648
to explain all of this to you
in such detail,

39:45.682 --> 39:48.552
because we think
it's more fascinating

39:48.585 --> 39:51.956
to think of someone
poisoning themselves to death

39:51.989 --> 39:55.358
slowly on stage
than merely burning themselves.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.461
And after all, we're here
to entertain you.

40:01.065 --> 40:04.635
We really tell you this
'cause we're doing this stuff.

40:04.668 --> 40:09.072
We don't want you to be
thinking about how we did it.

40:09.106 --> 40:10.974
We want you to be thinking
about why.

40:11.007 --> 40:13.844
So sit back, relax.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.980
I'm gonna burn myself.

Not yet, creeps.

That was just the roof

I'd still like
to burn my tongue.

And I wanna tell you,
if that last thing took you

40:57.554 --> 41:00.523
by surprise and up-tightened
you a little bit,

41:00.557 --> 41:02.860
this next thing will probably
make you puke your guts out.
