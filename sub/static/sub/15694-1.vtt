00:28.695 --> 00:29.988
[exhales heavily]

00:36.494 --> 00:38.246
[music playing in headphones]

01:22.540 --> 01:24.292
[messenger trills]

01:42.602 --> 01:46.022
[Ethan's mom] Sweetie?
How many hits we up to now?

01:46.105 --> 01:47.649
We just hit a million.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.193
-[Ethan's mom] Whoo!
-[messenger trilling]

01:50.276 --> 01:52.278
[emoticon chuckles on speaker]

01:52.362 --> 01:53.738
[Charlie] I'm gonna kick some ass.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.199
-I'm gonna kick some ass.
-[Ethan's mom] Charlie!

01:56.282 --> 01:58.535
Be careful or someone might kick your ass.
[chuckles]

01:58.618 --> 02:02.497
Charlie, do not say that.
We don't kick people's asses.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.791
-[crying]
-Here you go, Grandma.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.711
[music playing loudly]

02:09.378 --> 02:11.256
Hey, are there any more comments about me?

02:11.339 --> 02:14.175
Everyone's loving your voice, Mom.
Seriously.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.262
I am so sorry about that.
I'll take it right off the bill.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.389
Hey, dude, where are you?

02:20.598 --> 02:21.599
At my house. What's up?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.935
Hey, table ten said
their shawarma was overdone.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.061
That is the third time this week.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.188
If you do it again,
I gotta tell my dad. Okay?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.648
No, dude, where are you exactly?

02:28.731 --> 02:31.568
I'm obviously at my fucking house
with my mom, Tariq.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.777
Why are you being so weird?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.700
I want you to remember where you were
the day your whole life changed.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.160
[heavy breathing]

02:40.785 --> 02:45.707
[Ray sighs] I can't believe this is it.
Our last fest together.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.375
[Shannie] Mmm. That's right.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.544
[Ray] Well, we should talk about it.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.963
-I better keep packing.
-Hmm?

02:54.674 --> 02:55.800
[sighs]

02:57.343 --> 02:58.928
[grunting]

02:59.012 --> 03:02.098
[chuckling] Come on.
Two more minutes, please?

03:02.181 --> 03:04.767
Hey, you don't have to pack
everything anyway.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.603
It's not like you're not coming back.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.396
[Shannie sniffles] Mmm.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.899
-Right?
-We need to get up.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.152
Need to get up.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.623
You know, lots of couples
make it through periods of long distance.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.793
If... if they want to.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.880
They just announced
a last-minute add to the lineup.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.840
You're never gonna guess who it is!

04:17.048 --> 04:18.757
All right, bae, ready to pop your rave--

04:18.841 --> 04:20.009
Oh, no.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.011
You're not wearing that.
You look like a nun.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.222
[chuckles] Okay.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.684
["All I Ever Wanted" playing]

04:27.767 --> 04:29.227
[Neil] You're not sick of
that fucking song yet?

04:29.310 --> 04:31.479
No, dude, this track is tight.
It's so good.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.314
You know what I am sick of, though?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.024
Is this cheesy '90s shit.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.652
No wonder we're going out of business.
You know?

04:37.735 --> 04:40.071
You know what?
Maybe if you were more focused,

04:40.154 --> 04:41.614
we wouldn't be going out of business.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.951
Did we put this up or did someone sneak in
and put this up in...

04:45.034 --> 04:46.160
I don't remember.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.620
Yeah, I'm focusing, for sure.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.497
I can't believe I'm going to fucking XOXO.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.666
It's like I'm making up
for shit I did in a past life.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.543
Dude, this is the best part right here.
This is...

04:53.626 --> 04:56.838
This is my favorite part.
Neil, right here? So good.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.631
-[baby crying]
-[sighs]

04:58.715 --> 05:01.426
I'm sorry, can you say that again?
I think I just had an aneurysm.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.760
[chuckles]

05:02.844 --> 05:05.722
I said, I managed to book you a slot.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.600
You're gonna DJ at XOXO... in eight hours.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.426
Avilo is gonna be there.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.219
Dude, we're gonna be able
to feel the bass.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.556
No Avilo, no Martin Garrix, no fest.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.767
We're gonna take the bus,
we're gonna go right to the festival,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.561
we're gonna drop everybody off,
then come back. That's it.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.938
Ugh!

05:57.190 --> 05:58.232
You're nasty, man.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.777
I'm not nasty, dude.
I'm just trying to make money.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.529
And I have to recount it now
because you keep talking.

06:07.825 --> 06:08.951
[all cheering] Yeah!

06:12.413 --> 06:16.000
Jesus! You think they'd make you
assemble your own setup from scratch?

06:16.626 --> 06:17.919
I just want to be prepared.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.755
This is XOXO,
not a party at someone's mom's house.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.881
Dude, I got you so hooked up,

06:21.964 --> 06:23.591
you're probably not even gonna
have to touch your stuff.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.676
They'll have minions to do it for you.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.846
Hey, seriously though, man...

06:28.930 --> 06:31.974
I was able to book you
because you deserve to be there.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.520
Once all those people hear your tracks,
it's gonna be, like, on.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.522
They're not gonna hear my tracks.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.232
Except for "All I Ever Wanted."
I'll play that last.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.650
What?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.401
They're not ready, Tariq. You know that.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.073
These are the rough tracks
for the record label guy.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.491
Don't lose them.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.909
Seriously.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.995
Dude, I got this.
Everything's taken care of.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.000
What's that smell?

06:58.084 --> 07:01.504
Don't freak out,
but I just gotta make a few deliveries.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.005
What do you mean deliveries?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.715
My dad fired Mo.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.883
[chuckles nervously]

07:06.551 --> 07:07.969
No. No.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.971
-[stammers] No, don't worry.
-Dude!

07:10.054 --> 07:12.515
I only have to cover his lunch shift
till 2:30, 3:00 at the latest.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.476
Dude, how am I supposed to get there?
Where are we even going right now?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.936
I got you a seat on this party bus, man.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.105
-I'll get there right after you, I swear.
-A party bus? Seriously?

07:19.188 --> 07:20.815
How can you do this to me?
You're gonna make me go alone?

07:20.898 --> 07:21.983
Party buses are great.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.402
You can pass out your promos to people,
get them to come to the show--

07:24.485 --> 07:27.655
Don't you have that meeting with the
label guy that you're supposed to go to?

07:27.738 --> 07:30.199
If you go back to work, there's no chance
that your dad lets you out.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.076
That is a definite. [scoffs]

07:32.160 --> 07:35.037
Oh, my God! My God, dude. This is a sign.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.874
This is a total sign. There's no chance
I can go. This whole thing's a trap.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.667
A trap? Dude, what do you think
they're gonna do?

07:39.750 --> 07:43.880
Lure you out to steal your
shitty synthesizers and your 2007 Acer?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.965
Just trust me. I've gotten us this far.

07:46.048 --> 07:49.844
You are gonna play an amazing set
and I am gonna be there.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.513
-We're in this together, just like always.
-[sighs]

07:53.222 --> 07:55.641
I promise. Everything's going to be fine.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.192
Yes! Whoo!

08:05.109 --> 08:06.652
Oh... beautiful.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.372
-[rave girl] Hi.
-Hey.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.874
Do you have somewhere
I could store these?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.334
Yeah. Bottom of the bus.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.543
But they'll get crushed.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.253
Happens to butterflies every day.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.631
[girls scream]

08:26.714 --> 08:28.257
Whatever.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.842
Hey, is there Wi-Fi on the bus?

08:29.926 --> 08:32.636
Dude... kill yourself.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.807
Come on, let's go.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.601
No, it feels like it's missing something.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.602
Did you pack my fog machine?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.480
No. We don't need that.
There's bigger issues.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.357
There was a dead raccoon
in the storage compartment.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.566
Are you serious?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.610
Did it look natural?
How bad was it?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.403
No, it hung itself.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.198
Come on, let's go. It was depressed
because we didn't fucking leave yet.

08:58.329 --> 09:02.291
[squeaky] All right, party people!
Are you ready for XOXO?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.168
[passengers cheering]

09:08.464 --> 09:12.635
[squeaky] Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, it is now time to rave.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.229
We should take these
right before we get in.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.397
Stretch it out a little longer.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.523
I know, but I can't believe

09:25.606 --> 09:26.899
this is the last time
we're gonna be doing this--

09:26.983 --> 09:29.277
Hey! Stop! Stop the bus!

09:36.492 --> 09:38.286
[passengers cheering]

09:54.010 --> 09:55.803
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.430
[all chanting] Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!

09:57.513 --> 09:59.098
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!

09:59.181 --> 10:00.474
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!

10:00.558 --> 10:02.268
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!

10:02.351 --> 10:05.104
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!

10:05.187 --> 10:07.565
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!

10:10.484 --> 10:13.321
-[Darla] Your soul mate?
-I just have a feeling, you know?

10:13.404 --> 10:15.698
He sent me this song
and it was like he knew me.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.409
Like, he knew it would be
the perfect song to send me.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.620
Krystal, everyone's listening
to that song.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.872
Aw, little Krystal wants a soul mate.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.749
What do you want with a soul mate?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.751
You know we're going to a huge party?

10:26.834 --> 10:29.211
There's gonna be endless hot guys
for you to choose from.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.589
Like, a candy store of dudes.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.800
That's cool that you like candy,
but I want chocolate.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.720
The kind you save for a special occasion,
and eat slowly.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.389
I don't think it's that crazy.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.266
Most of our parents met
when they were our age.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.686
-Yeah, and now they're all divorced.
-Come on, don't give her shit.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.480
I've got a soul mate
I'm meeting up with, too.

10:47.563 --> 10:51.192
Maybe you guys have heard of him.
His name's DJ Avilo.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.194
[Chelsea and Nikki screaming]

10:56.113 --> 10:59.200
-[Nikki] XOXO, here we go!
-[girls screaming]

10:59.283 --> 11:00.618
[cell phone ringing]

11:04.413 --> 11:07.792
Hello? Hi. Yes, this is Tariq Hariri,
Ethan Shaw's manager.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.796
Yeah, I was supposed to meet
with Mr. Henderson at 6:00, but...

11:11.879 --> 11:15.549
if you can believe this, there was some
strange noise in the engine of my plane,

11:15.633 --> 11:19.178
so rather than risk it,
we decided to take the limo.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.556
No, out of all of my clients,
Ethan Shaw is my favorite.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.976
Okay.
I'm sorry, the limo is a little bit loud.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.730
No, no, we'll still be there.
We just might be a little bit late.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.608
Great. Okay, thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.779
-Come on.
-[Mr. Hariri] Tariq!

11:36.862 --> 11:38.781
What are you doing?
We have customers!

11:38.864 --> 11:40.116
I, uh... I...

11:40.199 --> 11:41.242
Sorry.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.244
[sighs]

11:43.327 --> 11:45.121
[laughing] Oh!

11:47.873 --> 11:51.627
Dude, who're you texting?
Hey, bro! Bro, who're you texting, man.

11:51.710 --> 11:55.005
Come on. Let me in, man.
Let me in on your secrets.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.507
[laughing] Yo, bro.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.552
Yo, I came correct to this shit.

11:59.635 --> 12:03.139
Brought sensations
for all occasions, my friend.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.725
Dude, check it. I'm gonna get started
with these little Vicodin babies here,

12:06.809 --> 12:11.689
and top that off with
these pharmaceutical-grade THC caps...

12:11.772 --> 12:13.149
later on, if you're interested.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.359
Oh, and the mushies
are for whenever the sun...

12:15.443 --> 12:17.945
Ah! That's dumb, man! I'm sorry.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.947
I'm actually trying to work
on something right now--

12:20.030 --> 12:22.283
Dude, I'm gonna save the molly
for right before Avilo,

12:22.366 --> 12:23.742
so it's, like, crazy intense.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.286
-[Shannie] What is he doing?
-[drug guy] Know what I'm saying?

12:25.369 --> 12:26.996
Poor fucking guy.

12:27.079 --> 12:32.084
Consider the fact
that the universe is infinite.

12:32.168 --> 12:36.005
Hey. Hey, do... do you wanna sit with us?
We have room.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.590
[chuckles softly]

12:37.673 --> 12:38.757
One second.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.928
-Thanks. I needed that.
-[Shannie chuckles]

12:44.763 --> 12:47.683
No, I didn't come to this with anybody.
I feel like...

12:47.766 --> 12:51.687
Oh, very nice. Listening to Ethan Shaw.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.897
-Yeah.
-We're pretty stoked about it.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.899
We think he's gonna be
the best thing at the fest.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.025
So good.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.361
You guys are fucking with me, right?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.247
Aren't we supposed to go that way?

13:10.331 --> 13:15.002
No way, girl, we're VIP.
Darla got us that sweet hookup.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.670
[girls cheering]

13:18.088 --> 13:22.259
Oh, don't worry, Krystal.
Jordan will still be there. We promise.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.844
-[girls cheering]
-[Chelsea] XOXO!

13:25.429 --> 13:27.598
-[indistinct chatter]
-[chuckling]

13:29.475 --> 13:31.393
Oh, my God, it's DJ Polaroid!

13:37.149 --> 13:39.193
Happy XOXO, ladies.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.279
To being young and pretty,
and to not giving a fuck.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.991
And to Krystal. May she finally get some
and stop babbling about soul mates.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.911
I can't do shots. I'll throw up.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.621
-Mmm. Come on.
-No.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.747
You got it, girl. Let's go.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.041
-You got it. Uh-huh.
-All right!

13:54.124 --> 13:55.834
[girls cheering]

13:55.918 --> 13:58.337
-That's my girl. Let's go.
-Let's go dance.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.006
[music playing on stereo]

14:17.606 --> 14:19.358
Hey, give 'em that top shelf this time.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.444
I got these.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.656
That's what you party girls like, right?

14:25.739 --> 14:27.032
The good stuff?

14:37.251 --> 14:40.379
I always felt like this nothing kid
from Costa Mesa,

14:40.462 --> 14:42.715
but when I was in the middle
of this massive crowd,

14:42.798 --> 14:46.468
with everybody moving together and...
I don't know, I felt like...

14:46.552 --> 14:49.638
You were a part of something way bigger?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.181
Yeah.

14:51.765 --> 14:52.850
And just...

14:52.933 --> 14:56.061
Just to be performing at the same event
as DJ fucking Avilo, it's...

14:56.145 --> 14:58.689
-Yeah.
-That's insane.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.402
I'm telling you, this is what's wrong
with the scene nowadays.

15:03.485 --> 15:08.699
I remember when Avilo was this jerky kid
that was literally paying club promoters

15:08.782 --> 15:10.868
so he could play shitty events
in San Bernardino.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.579
And Anders,
he was this weirdo, chubby Asian kid

15:13.662 --> 15:16.415
that was passing out fliers
to get people to come to his shows.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.834
This shit is why
I turned my back on that...

15:18.918 --> 15:20.085
-Neil?
-on the whole culture.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.171
-Neil?
-Yeah, hold on one second, okay?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.049
[music playing on stereo]

15:25.925 --> 15:27.009
[laughing]

15:28.552 --> 15:30.554
Hey, are you ready to go inside?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.723
That guy's actually Avilo's manager.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.892
He said he's gonna get us
inside his private room.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.519
And introduce us to Anders.
Come on. We're going.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.813
-Who's Anders?
-Are you serious?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.232
Anders created XOXO.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.110
No one's ever met him
'cause he's super secretive and stuff.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.071
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.407
Do you think he'll know someplace
to charge my phone?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.159
I'm moving to New York tomorrow.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.411
I just got a job
at a wealth management firm.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.913
-That's crazy.
-Yeah.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.122
Do you have a job there, too?

15:57.206 --> 16:01.251
No, I'm in a five-year program,
so I have another year of school.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.545
So you guys are doing
the whole long-distance thing.

16:05.005 --> 16:08.968
We haven't really...
really talked about it yet, but, I mean...

16:11.470 --> 16:15.224
Peace, love, unity, respect.
That all became this vapid bro culture.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.476
Honestly, I feel sad for you guys
in your fucking tank tops.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.769
-Yeah.
-I feel totally sad.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.938
-Yeah. Is that--
-Sad. Actual sadness.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.564
-What, dude?
-Uh-huh. Yeah. I feel sad, too.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.857
-Do you hear that sound?
-[rattling]

16:24.650 --> 16:26.026
-Sir? Excuse me.
-[Neil shushes]

16:26.110 --> 16:27.945
I've been trying to talk to Montel
about it, but--

16:28.028 --> 16:29.321
[Neil] Stop talking
so I can hear the sound.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.031
I think the driver might be deaf.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.658
[indistinct chatter]

16:32.741 --> 16:34.618
Hey, thank you. Whenever you're ready.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.583
Come in.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.130
Yes, Tariq?

16:46.213 --> 16:50.634
Uh, Dad, um, you said
I only had to cover Mo's shift until 3:00.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.220
[stammers] It's 3:23. Can I please go?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.723
There's only one couple,
and they're finished with their--

16:55.806 --> 16:59.601
Tariq, I'm busy with this paperwork.
I need you to work the dinner shift.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.564
The... the dinner shift?
Dad, Jahar is coming in at 4:00.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.773
You have somewhere better to be?

17:06.983 --> 17:09.694
I, uh, told you
Ethan's concert is tonight.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.488
I'm his manager. I have to be there.

17:11.571 --> 17:14.575
You are my manager.
I'm the one who pays you.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.703
[sighs] I just...
I don't want to do this forever.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.833
[sighs] This restaurant
that I struggled to build

17:22.915 --> 17:23.916
is not good enough for you?

17:24.001 --> 17:26.627
No, Dad. No.
It's not that it's not good enough.

17:26.712 --> 17:31.258
You don't appreciate
the value of stability, Tariq. Of family.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.260
Ethan is my family, Dad.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.428
[Mr. Hariri sighs]

17:34.511 --> 17:36.722
His video has over
one million views on YouTube.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.725
I booked him a slot
at the biggest rave in America.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.977
He's gonna be a big success, Dad,
and I'm gonna be there--

17:42.061 --> 17:43.979
Tariq! This is madness.

17:45.147 --> 17:50.027
[sighs] I give you a good job, a future,
and you shit on it.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.780
I like being his manager,
and I think that I'm good at it.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.699
You know, maybe it turns out
that I'm not and I fail,

17:55.783 --> 17:57.785
but at least I'll know
that I had tried and I...

17:59.036 --> 18:01.246
I'd hope that you would understand that.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.836
Anyways, I'm going now.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.630
Tariq. Tariq!

18:09.713 --> 18:11.423
Don't even think about it.

18:18.889 --> 18:19.973
Tariq!

18:21.225 --> 18:22.851
[rattling]

18:27.064 --> 18:28.899
[engine sputters and hisses]

18:28.982 --> 18:30.734
-[Chad] What the fuck?
-What just happened?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.194
[Jayce] Uh...

18:32.277 --> 18:33.320
[Vince] What the hell is going on?

18:33.403 --> 18:36.865
Uh, all right, listen up.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.410
All right... Listen, guys.
Just relax for a little bit, okay?

18:40.494 --> 18:42.621
Uh, the bus broke down.

18:42.704 --> 18:43.789
-[passengers] What?
-Are you kidding me?

18:43.872 --> 18:44.998
[man] What the fuck, bro?

18:45.082 --> 18:46.792
[angry clamoring]

18:47.709 --> 18:48.877
I know, I...

18:49.920 --> 18:53.340
-I want my money back, fuckface!
-[man] We're gonna miss the fucking show!

18:53.423 --> 18:55.801
-Get up.
-[drug guy] Start it back up!

18:55.884 --> 18:57.845
-Come on.
-[Ray] Shannie, where are you going?

18:57.928 --> 18:59.388
Let's just wait a second.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.057
-How're we gonna get there?
-Fix it. Somebody fucking fix this shit.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.725
[Neil] I don't know what to say.
[Chad] Fix it.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.728
All right, guys, let's remember
the good vibes we had earlier.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.938
[Brock] Fuck the good vibes.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.815
[all yelling]

19:09.898 --> 19:11.316
What the fuck?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.152
[Neil] Don't say the f-word.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.322
-[drug guy] I must go.
-[Jayce] Stay hydrated out there.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.075
[drug guy] Sorry. Goodbye, friend.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.535
[Neil] It'll be all right.
We'll figure it out.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.703
[girl] I want my money back.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.329
[Jayce] Put some sunscreen on.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.873
It's two, three miles, tops.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.833
We want our money back, punk.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.543
All right, uh...

19:29.626 --> 19:32.045
you guys signed the thing,
and it said "no refunds," so...

19:32.129 --> 19:34.548
Yeah, it did. Also, it didn't say nothing
about the bus breaking down.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.675
-Get out of the bus.
-What the fuck is your game plan?

19:36.758 --> 19:38.594
-All right.
-Come on, let's go!

19:38.677 --> 19:41.597
-Get off the fucking bus!
-[Neil] I don't have your money on me.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.557
-[Chad] Keep fucking talking, buddy.
-[Brock] Let's go.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.808
Get that little bitch out here.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.643
-All right.
-[Brock] Come on. Get him out here.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.812
-Fuck!
-Are you gonna give, like, what?

19:48.937 --> 19:51.190
[Tariq]  Hello, you've reached
Tariq Hariri Management.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.399
I'm unavailable--

20:15.464 --> 20:17.257
Hey! You want a ride?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.760
You want some peyote? It's homegrown.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.639
-[Shannie] Come on!
-[hippie woman laughs]

20:23.722 --> 20:24.973
[Shannie] Yes!

20:25.057 --> 20:27.226
-[Shannie] Yay!
-[hippie woman exclaims]

20:33.815 --> 20:35.901
[GPS voice]  Insufficient service
to determine route.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.653
-Okay.
-I am unable to identify

20:37.736 --> 20:39.905
-Everything is gonna be fine.
-your current location.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.741
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-You are not on a road.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.118
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-You are not on a road.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.590
[camera shutter clicks]

21:05.931 --> 21:07.808
[door creaks and shuts]

21:24.283 --> 21:25.659
[indistinct bickering]

21:30.289 --> 21:31.915
[retching]

21:35.961 --> 21:37.671
Hey, what's going on in here?

21:39.339 --> 21:41.216
Um, nothing.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.016
-You waiting for someone?
-Kind of.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.144
-[sighs]
-[text message sends]

21:53.020 --> 21:56.064
Are you sure he knows where to find you?

22:03.113 --> 22:06.283
-Thank you.
-Be safe, but respect the journey.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.244
-[Shannie] Thank you.
-Yeah, respect the journey.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.746
-[Shannie whoops]
-[Ray] Here we go.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.748
[man humming]

22:12.831 --> 22:15.584
Hi, uh, my name's Ethan Shaw.
I'm performing.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.380
[mouthing] Hey. Hey. Hey.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.549
I don't have that name on the list.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.427
Are you sure? It's Shaw, uh, S-H-A-W.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.845
I know how to spell Shaw.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.556
I'm telling you
that name is not on the list.

22:30.557 --> 22:31.892
Are you sure? [stammers]

22:31.975 --> 22:33.351
-Okay, can you just give me--
-Sir.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.478
one second? Just one second.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.687
-I need to figure this out.
-Sir!

22:35.771 --> 22:37.481
[operator]  Sorry, the subscriber
you're trying to reach--

22:37.564 --> 22:38.607
[ticket taker] Sir!

22:39.649 --> 22:43.403
If you'd like to buy a ticket
to get in here, the line is next to you.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.616
That line's gonna take forever.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.369
I don't have that kind of time.
I have to set up. I swear. Can you--

22:51.453 --> 22:53.622
Is there any way you could walkie someone?
Isn't that what it's for?

22:53.705 --> 22:54.831
Ethan, take my ticket. I'll get a new one.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.124
-What?
-[Shannie] Okay...

22:56.208 --> 22:59.002
Isn't seeing him play one of the reasons
we came here in the first place?

22:59.086 --> 23:01.088
You need it more than I do.
We can wait in the line.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.547
It's like 20 minutes.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.050
Come on, Shannie.
It's the right thing to do.

23:05.133 --> 23:08.762
If you want to go in now, that's fine,
but I'll wait out here.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.183
Fine. Yeah, you should take the ticket.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.393
-[Ray] Yeah.
-Are you sure?

23:15.477 --> 23:19.147
Yeah, we'll be in right behind you.
Just pay us back with an amazing set.

-Okay. Go get 'em.
-See you in there!

23:25.362 --> 23:26.446
Thanks.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.909
Rock it out!

23:30.992 --> 23:32.077
Whoo!

23:32.160 --> 23:34.746
-That was nice, right?
-Go get in line.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.376
[indistinct chatter]

23:47.717 --> 23:49.886
You know, I, uh, gotta tell you...

23:49.970 --> 23:53.390
[man on radio]  I am the person
I believe myself to be.

23:53.932 --> 23:58.395
-[breathing heavily] All right.
-I am capable, confident and careful.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.480
Of all the clients I've managed,
I gotta tell ya,

24:00.564 --> 24:02.232
Ethan Shaw is by far my favorite.

24:02.315 --> 24:04.734
-[mutters under breath]
-Doors open when I walk toward them.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.319
All right. Let's do this.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.248
[Brock] Let's go, bro. Come on.
[Neil] All right.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.876
I get you guys are strong.
You don't need to stretch my shirt out.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.252
That's not gonna happen.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.628
ATM machine is down here.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.796
[Chad] Right.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.506
You're upset.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.551
-What? No.
-Shannie...

24:29.634 --> 24:31.178
Listen, I just want to be in there, okay?

24:31.261 --> 24:35.056
I know!
We'll be there in literally seven minutes.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.349
Seven minutes?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.854
Whoo!

24:42.480 --> 24:45.400
-I want something more.
-[cell phone tweets]

24:45.483 --> 24:47.319
More what?

24:47.402 --> 24:51.156
-More...
-Hey, is that for me? [chuckles]

24:51.239 --> 24:52.657
More...

24:53.366 --> 24:55.577
mmm, swirly.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.248
-I'm sorry, did you say swirly?
-[chuckles] Yeah, swirly.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.542
All right. So wait, you, uh...

25:02.626 --> 25:04.669
you want some ice cream now? Is that it?

25:04.753 --> 25:06.254
-No.
-No?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.757
No. Um, I mean, like...

25:10.508 --> 25:13.345
It's like,
you go through life alone, right?

25:13.428 --> 25:20.143
And all of your experiences,
choices, feelings, everything, it's...

25:21.061 --> 25:22.854
it's all your own.

25:22.979 --> 25:26.983
-Okay, but see, that's... that's freedom.
-But I...

25:27.067 --> 25:28.526
[sighs]

25:28.610 --> 25:31.488
I think when you make
that connection with somebody,

25:31.571 --> 25:35.408
it kind of... gets you outside yourself.

25:36.576 --> 25:40.455
And then you get to share
all of those moments with somebody else.

25:40.538 --> 25:46.294
Like a perfect sunset,
or a festival or a kiss.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.297
That's love.

25:50.757 --> 25:55.262
-That's all I've ever wanted.
-[chuckles] Okay.

25:55.345 --> 25:59.933
So what makes you think this guy Jordan
is the one to swirl with you?

26:01.393 --> 26:02.852
[chuckles softly] Uh...

26:02.936 --> 26:06.356
You're gonna laugh at me,
so I don't wanna tell you that.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.796
[cheering]

26:38.263 --> 26:39.389
[bouncer] Backstage pass?

26:39.472 --> 26:41.516
Hi, I'm Ethan Shaw.
I'm actually performing.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.643
Backstage pass.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.324
[sighs] Look, so I am performing.
Uh, I just...

26:57.407 --> 26:59.743
Is there any way that you could get
in contact with someone--

26:59.826 --> 27:01.661
Probably not.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.914
I need time to set my stuff up,
so if you could talk to somebody--

27:04.998 --> 27:06.249
No. Not right now.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.085
Why would I be carrying all of this crap
if I wasn't performing?

27:09.169 --> 27:10.628
Just so I could look cool?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.089
Man, I don't question
the shit you people do.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.550
One guy out there's got a vacuum cleaner.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.721
I have no idea
what he intends to clean with that thing.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.639
Give me a pass, you go through.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.768
Here, check out Ethan Shaw.
Lolita stage, 7:00 p.m.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.227
It's gonna be great, all right?

27:26.311 --> 27:29.314
Dude, check out Ethan Shaw at 7:00 p.m.
It's gonna be off the chart.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.940
Hey, check out Ethan--

27:45.497 --> 27:47.374
[Mr. Hariri echoing]  Tariq.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.334
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.462
Oh, God. Okay... Oh, fuck. Shit!

27:52.545 --> 27:54.964
[Tariq]  Okay. No, no, no, no, no. No!

27:55.048 --> 27:59.386
Sometimes we receive messages from
the universe that are important, right?

27:59.469 --> 28:02.972
But we have a tendency to read them wrong.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.349
[cell phone tweets]

28:04.432 --> 28:07.560
[stammers] Well, who's to say
what's right or wrong?

28:07.685 --> 28:09.062
[chuckles] I don't know.

28:09.145 --> 28:12.023
I'm just saying, you know,
keep an open mind.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.483
[cell phone tweets]

28:16.903 --> 28:18.029
Go ahead.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.496
You gotta go?

28:26.579 --> 28:28.748
I probably should
just go out there, right?

28:28.832 --> 28:30.417
They're never gonna want
to leave backstage.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.127
Yeah.

28:32.210 --> 28:37.132
Hey, you know,
you'll find it, or it'll find you.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.051
Good luck.

28:41.010 --> 28:44.013
-[sniffs] Krystal!
-[Chopper] Whoa, wait. Stay here.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.390
Stay here. I'll grab her.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.476
Okay.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.697
[breathing heavily]

29:04.117 --> 29:07.328
There's a $200 limit.
I can't get the money out.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.247
What's your plan?
How're you gonna make this right?

29:09.330 --> 29:11.666
I don't know, but there's a limit,
so I can't get it out.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.418
Yeah, you said full fucking refund.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.044
I understand.
What do you want me to fucking do?

29:15.128 --> 29:17.964
All right, bro.
We're gonna wait 55 minutes,

29:18.047 --> 29:19.466
and then you're gonna withdraw again--

29:19.549 --> 29:21.676
That's an arbitrary amount of time.
It's not gonna--

29:21.760 --> 29:23.636
-That's genius.
-Boys, that'll work.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.889
-It's not gonna fuckin' work.
-Do it again!

29:25.972 --> 29:28.725
Wait... Excuse me... Ethan Shaw.

29:30.310 --> 29:34.314
Everyone! XOXO has reached capacity.

29:34.397 --> 29:38.610
-All entrances are now closed.
-What? Bro, what the fuck?

29:38.693 --> 29:42.405
[ticket taker]  Like I said,
the event is now at capacity.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.117
There are no more tickets!

29:46.201 --> 29:47.786
[indistinct chatter]

29:47.869 --> 29:50.330
[man] Hey, come on, dude!
[man 2] What the hell?

29:50.413 --> 29:52.540
Sorry, there are no more tickets.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.375
[man] Hey, fuck you!

29:54.459 --> 29:55.627
[angry clamoring]

30:07.889 --> 30:08.973
[cell phone tweets]

30:19.567 --> 30:21.069
[angry clamoring]

30:27.283 --> 30:29.911
I am dispensing
crucial information right now.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.956
-[cell phone ringing]
-What I'm saying could save your life.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.793
-Hello?
-Tariq. Jesus, where are you?

30:36.876 --> 30:39.087
It is very important
that you pay attention.

30:39.170 --> 30:43.299
Ethan... it's all changed, man.
Everything has changed.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.803
There was a... there was a girl.
A bad girl.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.806
-What?
-I'm so sorry, Ethan.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.808
[distorted]
Are you listening to me, Tariq?

30:52.684 --> 30:53.726
I'm so sorry.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.478
Tariq, I don't understand.
What's going on? I can't hear--

30:55.562 --> 30:56.896
[Krystal] Oh. Oh!

30:56.980 --> 30:58.815
-I am so sorry.
-[Ethan] Oh!

30:58.898 --> 31:01.150
I'm just such an idiot.
I wasn't paying attention.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.235
No, it's okay. I...

31:04.028 --> 31:05.530
I...

31:05.613 --> 31:07.532
uh...

31:07.615 --> 31:09.325
I don't know, I was on my phone and--

31:09.409 --> 31:11.661
[chuckles softly]
I was on my phone, too.

31:11.744 --> 31:12.871
[chuckles and scoffs]

31:12.954 --> 31:15.957
Yeah, people are really
into their phones these days.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.500
[both chuckle]

31:18.418 --> 31:19.752
[angry clamoring]

31:31.014 --> 31:32.098
-[Shannie] Shit!
-[Ray] What?

31:32.181 --> 31:33.933
-She just grabbed my ticket!
-Your ticket?

31:34.017 --> 31:35.643
-My ticket!
-Shannie!

31:39.898 --> 31:41.065
Shit!

31:42.859 --> 31:44.193
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

31:45.737 --> 31:49.282
-Well, it looks like that's everything.
-Yeah.

31:55.079 --> 31:58.583
-I'm Ethan--
-Nice to meet you. Um...

31:58.666 --> 32:01.336
[chuckles] I... Sorry, I... I have to go.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.676
[crowd yelling excitedly]

32:20.521 --> 32:22.023
[Tariq chuckles]

32:32.283 --> 32:33.534
[chuckles]

32:54.430 --> 32:55.682
[grunts]

32:58.518 --> 33:01.104
Look. Stop, stop, stop. Let's just go.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.940
Turn around. No, I know.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.692
Look, you don't have to let me in.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.694
Can you get in contact
with someone who knows--

33:07.777 --> 33:10.697
You see a girl come through here?
Pretty, real young looking.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.740
-Yeah. That way.
-Shit.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.283
My name is Ethan Shaw, okay?

33:14.367 --> 33:17.620
Ethan Shaw? Like, the YouTube kid?

33:18.621 --> 33:19.706
Yeah.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.127
I'm Chopper. I'm Avilo's manager.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.545
[sighs]

33:25.628 --> 33:27.255
-Coming in?
-Uh...

33:27.338 --> 33:29.173
No, he ain't got a backstage pass, boss.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.885
Oh, no, he's good. He's with me. Come on.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.472
I'm so, so sorry.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.599
Should we get back on the bus?

33:38.683 --> 33:42.020
Or maybe we can hitch a ride again?
There's gotta be a bunch of people

33:42.103 --> 33:44.105
that drove here that aren't getting in.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.400
Babe, talk to me.
I'm trying to come up with solutions.

33:47.483 --> 33:52.071
Will you please say something,
and not make me feel so guilty?

33:52.947 --> 33:54.282
I've got an idea.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.367
What?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.043
No.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.629
No. No. No, no, no.
You don't even know where that goes.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.340
Well, we're not gonna give up already.

34:11.424 --> 34:14.677
I'm moving tomorrow, Ray.
I'm moving far away.

34:14.761 --> 34:18.973
Don't you think you owe me
since you gave your ticket away?

34:25.063 --> 34:29.317
[sing-song] Adventure time.
Shannie and Ray.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.195
-Will you look out for cops, please?
-[chuckles]

34:34.112 --> 34:36.699
It's a total emergency.
They dropped Aoki's cake.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.328
I need a new one, stat.
Where is the nearest Costco?

34:42.038 --> 34:44.040
Holy shit, that's Walter Robot.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.835
Uh-huh.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.755
Motherfucker owes me ten grand.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.519
You already know that area.
Over here, that's the candy store.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.817
Open bar. All you can drink.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.862
All you can eat.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.281
My man's with me. Come on.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.000
[crowd cheering]

36:35.860 --> 36:37.445
[women cheering]

36:40.364 --> 36:41.908
Okay. All right.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.159
-[man in shark suit] Let's go!
-No, thanks.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.328
-Come on, man.
-Go. You wouldn't wanna miss...

36:45.411 --> 36:47.371
-Come on.
-miss Skrillex. Go ahead.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.044
[Chopper sighs]

36:53.127 --> 36:54.962
Welcome to the lion's den, kid.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.173
[chuckles]

36:58.090 --> 36:59.133
Yo, yo!

36:59.217 --> 37:02.428
[Avilo] Sonic, this time I want you
to throw the laser off the wall,

37:02.511 --> 37:05.514
and then it can kind of boom
off of her buns.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.892
[Chopper] Look what I found
hanging around outside.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.478
The YouTube kid
we were just talking about.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.525
Hey. Welcome.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.152
Uh, Ethan, right?

37:19.237 --> 37:20.446
[girls giggling]

37:20.529 --> 37:21.614
-Sorry.
-[Avilo] That's okay.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.158
-Ethan Shaw, right?
-Yeah.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.743
Nice. Avilo.

37:25.826 --> 37:27.036
[chuckles] Hey.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.705
[Shannie groans] Ugh!

37:29.789 --> 37:33.000
-[Ray] Oh, my God.
-Hello?

37:34.001 --> 37:35.670
[water dripping and echoing]

37:36.712 --> 37:41.592
Okay, so if we went down the ladder here,
we should go right to start with, right?

37:41.676 --> 37:44.595
That's... that's the direction
of the gate?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.013
[Ray] Yeah...

37:46.097 --> 37:48.182
Yes. Yes, I think we go right.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.268
Okay then.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.978
Onwards.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.992
[cell phone ringing]

38:11.455 --> 38:13.457
-[gasps softly]
-[drug guy]  Dude!

38:16.085 --> 38:17.211
[ringing continues]

38:18.170 --> 38:19.755
[drug guy]  Phones, man...

38:24.719 --> 38:25.720
[cell phone beeps]

38:25.803 --> 38:28.139
[breathing heavily]

38:28.222 --> 38:31.434
-Hello?
-[woman]  Uh, hello. Mr. Hariri?

38:31.517 --> 38:34.645
Mr. Henderson is waiting for you
by the Sedona stage.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.022
Are you on your way?

38:37.773 --> 38:39.400
-No.
-What?

38:39.483 --> 38:41.027
Uh...

38:41.110 --> 38:43.529
I mean, yes.

38:43.612 --> 38:47.158
Okay. Okay, yes. Hang on.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.171
[indistinct chatter]

39:01.213 --> 39:02.423
[Brock] Let's go! Get him!

39:09.221 --> 39:10.264
[Tariq grunts]

39:12.433 --> 39:14.602
[Mr. Henderson]
But I'm not sure that, um...

39:14.685 --> 39:19.982
that YouTube hits
will translate directly to record sales.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.651
[distorted] Do you have some kind of a...

39:22.735 --> 39:25.613
a marketing strategy
for how to connect those two worlds?

39:25.696 --> 39:32.286
A two month release plan, um,
SoundCloud and artwork strategy.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.788
[Mr. Henderson chuckles]
What the fuck?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.207
-Sales.
-Get me a Coca-Cola, Patty.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.333
[Mr. Hariri distorted]  Tariq!

39:39.001 --> 39:40.378
Is the answer not sales?

39:40.461 --> 39:43.214
Um, what's happening right now?

39:44.465 --> 39:45.966
I think I might be dying.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.885
[bass drops on stereo]

39:53.599 --> 39:55.059
[crying]

40:00.439 --> 40:01.774
[sobbing]

40:03.567 --> 40:06.570
It is such a tragedy because,
as we all know,

40:06.654 --> 40:08.989
Tariq had done nothing with his life.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.950
[sighs]

40:11.033 --> 40:12.868
[music playing in headphones]

40:18.999 --> 40:21.252
It's sick back here, right?

40:21.335 --> 40:22.962
You like girls, Ethan?

40:24.338 --> 40:25.923
-[chuckles softly]
-Yeah?

40:26.006 --> 40:27.883
What do you like? Blondes? Brunettes?

40:28.676 --> 40:29.969
Asian chicks?

40:31.095 --> 40:32.304
[Ethan sighs]

40:32.388 --> 40:34.390
Ooh, you like Asians! [chuckles]

40:37.101 --> 40:39.019
Hey, come here. Sit here.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.355
-[Chelsea] Okay.
-Yeah.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.108
[chuckles]

40:46.694 --> 40:49.280
Take your shirt off
and give him a hand job.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.164
[laughing]

40:58.247 --> 40:59.498

40:59.582 --> 41:01.041
[girls laughing]

41:04.503 --> 41:07.256
-[chuckles nervously]
-I'm sorry. Just messing with you.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.513
[horse whinnying]

41:16.432 --> 41:17.475
[grunts]

41:18.225 --> 41:22.897
-Uh, hi.
-Your skin is so beautiful.

41:22.980 --> 41:27.610
It's like... like velvet.
Like... like rose petals.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.488
Oh. Thanks.
Yeah, well, you know, I better--

41:30.571 --> 41:33.324
I'm not from here. [chuckles]

41:33.866 --> 41:35.367
Like, from here or what do you--

41:48.214 --> 41:49.215
[Nikki laughs]

41:49.298 --> 41:53.052
So now, whenever we roll to Amsterdam,
we get treated like fucking royalty.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.679
-[Avilo] Yeah.
-[chuckles] Know what I'm saying?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.640
You can't get that kind of shit
in the States.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.099
-You really can't.
-You can't.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.809
-Ever been to Amsterdam, Ethan?
-[Chopper chuckles]

42:00.893 --> 42:02.478
Uh, no.

42:03.145 --> 42:04.313
You ever been out of the country?

42:06.315 --> 42:08.025
Shit, you haven't left California?

42:08.776 --> 42:10.736
I visited my cousins in Michigan once.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.530
-Okay. All right. Yeah.
-[girls chuckling]

42:12.613 --> 42:14.323
-Michigan.
-Dude, that is so perfect.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.617
Man, your whole life is gonna change.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.536
Change?

42:18.619 --> 42:20.579
When I said
we were just talking about you,

42:20.663 --> 42:22.540
it was for a specific reason.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.292
My boy Avilo here does charity work.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.962
-Charity work?
-[Avilo] Yeah. No, it's not...

42:28.045 --> 42:30.631
-It's not exactly charity. I guess.
-Might as well be.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.676
Okay, I've been so unbelievably fortunate.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.802
I've had a lot of success.

42:34.885 --> 42:38.180
I like to give back to the kids
who are coming up.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.224
I like to throw 'em a bone.
Put 'em on my label.

42:40.307 --> 42:43.310
That's why we feature
so many collaborations.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.854
Don't worry about that.
It's my artist. He's dope.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.773
That's why when we heard your track,

42:47.856 --> 42:49.358
we knew you'd be
a good addition to the team.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.484
Yeah.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.362
You get the exposure.
We get to help a new artist.

42:53.445 --> 42:54.697
-It's a win-win.
-Win-win.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.407
-[Chopper] Am I right?
-[Avilo chuckles] Sure.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.450
[stammers] I'm sorry. What are you saying?

42:58.534 --> 43:01.412
This is what Chopper's
trying to say, okay? You with me?

43:01.495 --> 43:04.957
We want you to come on board,
do a few tracks for us under my label.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.042
-[Chopper] Yeah.
-Think about that.

43:07.793 --> 43:09.962
[chuckles] I... I...

43:10.045 --> 43:12.298
-Yeah.
-[laughs] I wish I had my camera.

43:12.381 --> 43:13.424
Look at that face.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.843
I think I'm dead. I can't feel my face.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.886
[squeaky] Can you feel your face now?

43:17.970 --> 43:19.805
[moaning]

43:21.599 --> 43:23.726
-Shit.
-Ooh. Shit.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.102
[Chopper] Yeah.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.854
[music playing on stereos]

43:26.937 --> 43:28.731
[indistinct chatter]

43:30.816 --> 43:31.942
[cell phone tweets]

43:42.119 --> 43:43.329
[sighs]

43:45.873 --> 43:47.958
[Ray singing indistinctly]

43:54.548 --> 43:56.050
[Ray] At least your hair smells good.

43:56.884 --> 43:58.302
Uh...

43:59.386 --> 44:00.554
Right or left?

44:03.641 --> 44:05.934
I think we've already gone
down that tunnel.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.436
Me too.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.688
[Shannie] Down both tunnels.

44:10.522 --> 44:11.857
[sighs]

44:12.775 --> 44:15.069
We're going in circles.
We're never gonna get out.

44:15.152 --> 44:16.236
[Ray sighs]

44:16.320 --> 44:19.156
This was a great idea, Shan.

44:19.239 --> 44:22.117
[Ethan] No, I honestly can't wait
to show you the rest of the tracks.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.244
-[Avilo] Okay.
-As soon as my manager, Tariq, gets here,

44:24.328 --> 44:27.039
-I think we--
-Whoa. No, no, no. Hold up. No.

44:27.122 --> 44:29.124
No, this deal doesn't include no managers.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.877
-Right.
-If you roll with us, I'll manage you.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.045
[scoffs]

44:33.128 --> 44:35.464
But Tariq's the whole reason
why I'm even--

44:35.547 --> 44:36.632
[Avilo] No, listen, man. Hey.

44:36.715 --> 44:39.134
I've seen more DJs
than you can count come and go.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.721
I think you're talented. I really do.
But it is a tough business.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.682
I want you to be a star.
I want you to see Amsterdam.

44:44.765 --> 44:47.559
You know, just... Hey, think about it.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.312
If your manager's so good,
how come you couldn't get backstage?

44:52.856 --> 44:54.900
I mean, where the hell's he at?

44:54.983 --> 44:56.902
[breathing heavily]

45:15.045 --> 45:16.338
[crowd cheering]

45:20.175 --> 45:22.094
Oh, shit!

45:22.177 --> 45:23.679
[chuckles]

45:24.805 --> 45:25.889
Oh, shit!

45:27.391 --> 45:28.851
Hi.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.270
Hey.

45:31.353 --> 45:33.730
[crowd chanting indistinctly]

45:33.814 --> 45:36.692
-Me?
-[crowd chanting] Tariq! Tariq! Tariq!

45:36.775 --> 45:38.777
[chanting continues]

45:38.861 --> 45:39.945
I'm coming!

45:42.990 --> 45:44.658
[water gurgling]

45:59.214 --> 46:01.049
[laughing]

46:11.268 --> 46:12.895
[continues laughing]

46:19.818 --> 46:21.820
Oh, my God! Dude, my pocket synth.

46:21.904 --> 46:23.071
I don't have my pocket synth.

46:23.155 --> 46:24.740
-I think I left it at my house.
-Where is it?

46:24.823 --> 46:25.866
We gotta turn around.

46:25.949 --> 46:26.950
-I can't play.
-Is it in the trunk?

46:27.034 --> 46:28.535
No, I'm sure I left it at the house.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.287
-You didn't pack it?
-No, I didn't!

46:30.370 --> 46:31.747
You can't play
without the fucking pocket synth!

46:31.830 --> 46:33.790
I know I can't. We gotta go back.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.250
Seriously, we gotta turn around.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.920
-Ethan.
-What?

46:38.003 --> 46:39.713
It's in your hand, man.

46:40.714 --> 46:42.966
You've been holding it the whole time.

46:43.425 --> 46:44.801
[Ethan chuckles]

46:47.971 --> 46:49.473
[chuckles]

46:49.556 --> 46:52.684
Thanks, man.
I don't know what I would do without you.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.270
[echoing] You're welcome.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.943
[both chuckle]

47:01.860 --> 47:03.487
You'll be fine, man.

47:18.418 --> 47:20.587
[Tariq laughs]

47:27.719 --> 47:31.431
Don't you feel it?
It's like... like oxygen! Like...

47:31.515 --> 47:34.476
Like our hearts
and the earth are the same.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.561
Mmm.

47:35.644 --> 47:38.730
-We're like one.
-Yeah. Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

47:39.565 --> 47:41.483
Oh, who's that guy?

47:41.567 --> 47:43.777
Who... What's going on there?

47:45.237 --> 47:48.198
Hey, no. You know what, uh?
I... I can't...

47:48.282 --> 47:51.076
I think I'm done.
Thank you, but I think I'm done.

47:51.159 --> 47:52.244
Oh, God.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.379
-Help me. Help me, please!
-Oh, uh...

48:02.462 --> 48:04.381
Um, I'm so... I gotta go!

48:04.464 --> 48:08.010
No, please. Please!
I just... I need water.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.971
Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.806
[both grunt]

48:12.889 --> 48:14.516
-Oh.
-Mmm.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.271
Hey, would you mind taking a photo for us?

48:19.354 --> 48:21.398
-Yeah. Why don't--
-It'll take two seconds.

48:21.481 --> 48:22.524
You all have your phones.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.693
Why don't you live in the moment
for two seconds?

48:24.776 --> 48:27.237
Don't document everything.
Everyone's gonna believe you were here.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.948
-You don't need to Snapchat it.
-I didn't ask for a lecture.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.367
I just asked for a picture.

48:32.451 --> 48:35.954
And I picked you because you look
like you're here by yourself

48:36.038 --> 48:37.873
and not having a good time.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.793
If you wanna stay miserable,
you're more than welcome to.

48:41.877 --> 48:43.879
But it might be more fun...

48:44.796 --> 48:46.673
-Yeah.
-if you come and hang out with us.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.094
Come on. [chuckles]

48:51.803 --> 48:53.013
[softly] Yeah.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.183
[groans]

48:56.266 --> 48:57.684
[Tariq panting]

49:03.231 --> 49:05.359
He's not a bad man, you know.

49:05.442 --> 49:06.485
[sniffles]

49:06.568 --> 49:10.697
He just wants
what he thinks is best for me.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.449
Who does?

49:12.532 --> 49:14.201
[sighs] I'm his only son.

49:16.745 --> 49:20.916
In Lebanon, that's a big deal.
A son is your legacy.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.292
I see.

49:24.586 --> 49:26.922
I just... I need to prove...

49:28.507 --> 49:32.678
I need to prove myself to him,
and then he'll see...

49:34.012 --> 49:35.555
He'll see I was right.

49:35.639 --> 49:36.723
[chuckles]

49:36.807 --> 49:39.810
I'll buy him a car. Ferrari.

49:39.893 --> 49:40.977
[laughs]

49:41.061 --> 49:43.897
No... No, it's too expensive.

49:45.315 --> 49:46.441
I'll buy him a bike.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.110
[Mr. Hariri]  Tariq.

49:48.777 --> 49:49.861
[bell rings]

49:49.945 --> 49:51.488
[laughing]

49:55.659 --> 49:57.244
Whoo-hoo!

49:57.327 --> 49:58.620
[chuckles softly]

50:00.580 --> 50:01.915
[chuckles]

50:04.501 --> 50:06.545
Look, I don't know your dad...

50:06.628 --> 50:08.880
Achran Hariri.

50:09.715 --> 50:12.259
Or you, actually.

50:13.176 --> 50:16.221
[scoffs] I feel like you're not
gonna remember anything I say

50:16.304 --> 50:18.849
'cause you're the poster child
for D.A.R.E. right now.

50:18.932 --> 50:20.475
"Just say no."

50:20.559 --> 50:23.061
[imitates gunshot and chuckles]

50:23.145 --> 50:24.563
[chuckles]

50:24.646 --> 50:26.064
But, um...

50:28.066 --> 50:30.485
I think part of growing up
is accepting the fact

50:30.569 --> 50:33.697
that you're not always gonna get
everybody's approval.

50:33.780 --> 50:35.490
It's a waste of time to try.

50:36.283 --> 50:40.078
I mean, we only get what, like,
80ish years on this planet?

50:40.162 --> 50:41.955
Eighty years.

50:44.416 --> 50:48.545
Do you wanna spend all that time worrying
about what your dad thinks?

50:53.508 --> 50:55.677
I think you should meet my friend Ethan.

51:02.851 --> 51:05.395
I'm still tweaking it, but that's
basically what it's gonna sound like.

51:05.479 --> 51:08.356
Bro, that was fucking sick.
That shit could blow up, right?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.275
That was seriously really good.

51:10.358 --> 51:11.860
-[Ethan chuckles] Really?
-Yeah.

51:11.943 --> 51:14.946
I was thinking about adding an LFO
after the second drop, but--

51:15.030 --> 51:16.823
It would be amazing
if we could get that right now.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.200
You think? Do you have that USB on you?

51:18.283 --> 51:19.367
-Hell, yeah.
-Yeah.

51:19.451 --> 51:20.619
Well, it's not really--

51:20.702 --> 51:24.331
Is this kid aware that he's supposed to be
on the Lolita stage in ten minutes?

51:24.414 --> 51:29.211
Ten minutes? Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I'm so fucked.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.425
[music playing on stereos]

52:53.128 --> 52:57.549
So what you're saying is that I should
tell my dad to close his restaurant.

52:57.632 --> 53:00.093
What? No.
I'm saying that you should tell...

53:01.011 --> 53:02.012
[sighs]

53:02.095 --> 53:03.263
[men speaking indistinctly]

53:03.346 --> 53:05.056
-Come on.
-He's fucked up! [laughs]

53:05.140 --> 53:06.933
Hey, guys. Guys, come on.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.185
No, don't talk
about your friend like that, okay?

53:09.269 --> 53:12.856
He's... he's beautiful
and he's your friend.

53:12.939 --> 53:14.524
He's... he's our friend.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.443
He's our friend. We're friends.

53:16.526 --> 53:17.903
[Brock] Yeah.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.988
[men laughing]

53:24.242 --> 53:26.870
-[Tariq] He's our friend.
-[Chad] Yeah, buds.

53:27.704 --> 53:29.873
-I'm so happy!
-Whoo!

53:30.123 --> 53:31.291
Let's go dance!

53:31.374 --> 53:32.876
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

53:35.045 --> 53:37.213
[music playing on stereos]

54:07.702 --> 54:09.245
Holy cow!

54:12.290 --> 54:14.793
Hey, check out that old guy.
Check him out!

54:19.047 --> 54:22.092
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, it's the guy from the fucking bus!

54:22.175 --> 54:24.177
Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

54:24.844 --> 54:26.596
Guys, what did we talk about?

54:26.680 --> 54:28.556
This man is an amazing dancer,

54:28.640 --> 54:31.184
and we have the glorious opportunity
to dance with him.

54:31.267 --> 54:34.437
-[Neil] Yeah.
-So, who do you wanna be, Chad?

54:36.022 --> 54:37.440
I want to be the guy who dances with him.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.901
-[Brock] What? Chad...
-That's a good choice.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.987
-That's a good choice!
-[chuckling]

54:43.071 --> 54:45.198
Get in here! Get in here!

54:45.281 --> 54:46.741
-[Neil] All right.
-All right.

54:47.450 --> 54:48.785
Whoa, whoa! Chill...

54:48.868 --> 54:50.704
-Come here, bro.
-Okay.

54:53.456 --> 54:54.749
[Chad] Peace.
[Neil] Peace.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.167
[both] Love.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.711
Unity.

54:57.794 --> 54:59.045
Respect!

54:59.129 --> 55:00.380
[Chad] Whoo!

55:00.463 --> 55:02.424
[all cheering]

55:06.219 --> 55:07.345
[Chad] All right!

55:07.429 --> 55:08.930
[Tariq chuckles] Whoo!

55:10.140 --> 55:12.559
[Neil cheering]

55:13.268 --> 55:14.436
[Brock] Whoo!

55:16.062 --> 55:17.647
[cheering]

55:20.650 --> 55:22.986
I used to DJ.
I used to do this shit in the '90s.

55:23.069 --> 55:24.279
It's not a big deal, but--

55:24.362 --> 55:27.240
You're telling me
you were here doing this 20 years ago?

55:27.323 --> 55:30.118
Yeah. Not at this exact place,
but yeah, totally.

55:30.201 --> 55:32.662
Wow, I could've been raving
when I was one year old!

55:32.746 --> 55:34.289
Oh, oh, guys, guys, guys.

55:34.372 --> 55:36.458
Ethan Shaw is
on the Lolita stage right now.

55:36.541 --> 55:38.126
What? That's my best friend.

55:38.209 --> 55:39.461
-Okay.
-That's my best friend, Ethan!

55:39.544 --> 55:41.087
-Okay.
-Come on, let's go! Come on!

55:41.171 --> 55:43.923
[Chad] Come on, let's go!
[Tariq] Let's go!

55:44.591 --> 55:46.342
[indistinct chatter]

55:54.893 --> 55:56.644
-Hey, man.
-[Ethan] Hey.

56:02.942 --> 56:05.278
I've got a V1 Launchpad and an RMX.

56:05.361 --> 56:08.198
Uh, no. No, we don't have
the inputs for those cables.

56:08.948 --> 56:12.368
-Uh... Okay.
-You got it?

56:12.452 --> 56:14.162
Your set's getting shorter every second.

56:14.245 --> 56:15.497
Yeah, I know.

56:15.580 --> 56:16.873
[under breath] Shit.

56:18.583 --> 56:22.045
-[Ray] We're fucked.
-Stop saying that.

56:22.128 --> 56:23.379
[music playing indistinctly]

56:23.463 --> 56:24.672
Can you hear that?

56:24.756 --> 56:26.591
We're definitely gonna get cholera,

56:26.674 --> 56:28.384
or typhoid or Lyme disease.

56:28.468 --> 56:32.138
There's rusty shit everywhere in here.
I'm not going any further.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.807
Really?

56:33.890 --> 56:36.851
How do you plan to get out
if you stay in the same place?

56:36.935 --> 56:38.436
Here we are, as always,

56:38.520 --> 56:40.939
stuck in the middle
of some ridiculous shithole

56:41.022 --> 56:42.273
because you think you're so free.

56:42.357 --> 56:44.567
You're so adventurous,
and so crazy and so fun!

56:44.651 --> 56:47.237
Well, at least I'm not scared of a tunnel.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.488
-You know what you are?
-It's a tunnel!

56:48.571 --> 56:49.948
You're scared of a conversation.

56:51.783 --> 56:54.369
You were afraid of having a conversation

56:54.452 --> 56:58.373
about the fact that you are moving away
and that we are going to...

56:58.915 --> 57:00.458
Shannie, where are you going?

57:00.542 --> 57:02.043
[sound technician] All right, you ready?

57:02.127 --> 57:03.711
[crowd chattering]

57:04.546 --> 57:05.964
[stammers] Uh, no.

57:09.175 --> 57:11.845
-Ethan Shaw, everybody!
-[feedback sounds]

57:14.973 --> 57:16.141
[music playing]

57:30.780 --> 57:32.240
[music distorts]

57:32.323 --> 57:33.783
Shit.

57:37.537 --> 57:38.872
[distortion continues]

57:40.665 --> 57:42.584
[crowd booing]

57:43.626 --> 57:44.669
Shit.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.510
Come on, come on. He's my best friend!

57:55.430 --> 57:56.931
[distorted music playing]

58:06.274 --> 58:09.068
-Guess who?
-Who?

58:09.152 --> 58:10.987
Oh, my God!

58:11.070 --> 58:13.281
I thought we were never going
to see each other.

58:13.364 --> 58:15.825
-Well, I'm super glad we did.
-[chuckles]

58:18.036 --> 58:19.787
This guy sucks. You wanna get out of here?

58:19.871 --> 58:21.956
I thought we were gonna wait for him
to play "All I Ever Wanted."

58:22.040 --> 58:24.042
-Look, I made a--
-Nah. He was all hype.

58:24.125 --> 58:26.002
Come on. Let's get out of here.

58:27.837 --> 58:28.838
Okay.

58:32.133 --> 58:33.676
[feedback humming]

58:33.760 --> 58:35.512
[indistinct chatter]

58:37.555 --> 58:39.057
[Ray] Shannie, where are you going?

58:39.140 --> 58:41.059
If you want to be in this tunnel forever,
that is fine,

58:41.142 --> 58:43.061
but I am going to go out
and go to the fest.

58:43.144 --> 58:46.022
Oh, fine. You go ahead.
Run away! Do what you do best!

58:46.105 --> 58:48.816
If I have to spend
one minute longer with you,

58:48.900 --> 58:51.528
I am going to fully freak out!

58:52.153 --> 58:55.114
-[groans] Oh, my...
-Shan.

58:55.198 --> 58:57.158
-Shannie.
-Don't touch me.

58:57.242 --> 59:00.161
Well, congratulations!
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

59:00.245 --> 59:03.581
Now let's just talk about it.
Finish your sentence.

59:03.665 --> 59:04.707
"We're gonna..."

59:07.544 --> 59:08.878
We're gonna break up.

59:20.014 --> 59:21.057
I can do it myself.

59:21.140 --> 59:23.893
-Ethan, come on. It wasn't that bad.
-What the fuck?

59:23.977 --> 59:26.104
I have been trying to get a hold of you
for hours.

59:26.187 --> 59:30.066
Yeah! My bus buddy, man! Let's crush that.

59:32.193 --> 59:33.361
Sorry.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.030
Are you fucked up right now?

59:36.990 --> 59:38.491
Is that why you haven't
been picking up your phone?

59:38.575 --> 59:41.327
You've been too busy partying
to worry about the details,

59:41.411 --> 59:43.246
like how the fuck I get in the festival?

59:43.329 --> 59:44.998
Ethan, I didn't take anything.

59:45.081 --> 59:47.625
Honestly, I don't care
what your excuse is.

59:47.709 --> 59:51.087
You knew that I was scared shitless
and that I needed you.

59:53.506 --> 59:55.883
You're not just a shitty manager, Tariq.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.802
You're a shitty friend.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.600
-Ethan, man, I'm... I'm sorry.
-Whatever, dude.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:06.644
Avilo offered me a collaboration deal.
I think I'm gonna take it.

01:00:07.645 --> 01:00:08.980
It doesn't involve you.

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:11.941
Since it doesn't seem like you give a shit
about being my manager,

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.860
it shouldn't bother you too much.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.447
[scoffs] Have fun doing
whatever the fuck you've been doing.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.038
[Jordan] I've been saving this for you.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.247
[Krystal sighs]

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:28.958
Oh, my goodness!

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.879
Wow! This is amazing.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:36.299
-Really cool, right?
-Oh! So cool.

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:43.222
[Krystal chuckles]

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.184
Are you drunk?

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.394
Uh, what?

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:52.732
You seem way too sober for this party.
You're gonna miss the whole experience.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:56.069
-Um, I mean, I had a little...
-Yeah?

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.987
-Come on. Follow me.
-Okay.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.242
[music playing on stereos]

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.668
[blowing raspberry]

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:13.336
Fucking cows!

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.922
You say, "Throw your hands to the left,"
they go to the left.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:18.299
You say, "Go to the right,"
they go to the right.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:20.426
You know what I see when I look out there?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.846
$10, $10, $10, $10, $10...

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.014
[chuckles]

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.224
I'm just messing.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.227
[sighs]

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.772
Hey, don't worry about your set, man.
No, that shit does not matter.

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.691
I tell these people what to like.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:37.485
They are gonna like you.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:39.153
Okay?

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:42.448
It's not romantic, I know,
but it's a business.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.702
The sooner you realize that,
the easier it's gonna be for you.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:46.911
Okay?

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:50.289
Get those tracks to me
as soon as you can.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.916
I'll get 'em in the right hands.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:54.961
And Chopper's gonna come by
to finalize the deal.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.504
All that bullshit. [scoffs]

01:01:56.587 --> 01:01:58.339
All right, buddy. Good talk.

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.890
[crying] I don't know
how to do anything without you.

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:12.103
I don't even know
how to match my own socks on my own.

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:16.733
How am I supposed to move
to big, dumb New York on my own?

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:20.611
[chuckles] No, come on.
It's a big adventure.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.702
Well, you're, uh...

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:31.539
[smacks lips] you're gonna have to grow up
a bit, Shan.

01:02:32.957 --> 01:02:35.626
-No more jumping in sewer tunnels.
-[chuckles]

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.173
And, on my end,

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:44.802
I need to remember that sometimes
jumping in sewer tunnels is important.

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:46.304
[inhales sharply] No.

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:50.308
[grunts] Oh, this was dumb! This was dumb.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.898
But that one time we went skinny-dipping
in Ash Meadows,

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:59.317
that was... that was pretty great.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:03.112
You got to remember to do stuff like that.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.740
[softly] Yep.

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.366
No girls.

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:11.996
-[chuckles] Yeah, celibate for life.
-That's right.

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:13.664
[chuckles softly]

01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:17.543
You are the strongest...

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:21.589
most courageous
person I have ever met.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.050
You're gonna be fine.

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:26.761
[stammers]

01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:31.057
Fuck that. We are going to be fine.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.727
-It'll be all right.
-Okay. [sniffles]

01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:39.565
[chuckles] Let's stay
in this tunnel forever.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.651
I'm done with this fucking tunnel.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.958
Um... [chuckles nervously]

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:58.960
So, who else have you seen play?

01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:01.838
-I saw a bunch of people. I don't know.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.966
-You were there when Ethan Shaw ate shit.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:10.096
Actually, I... I think I met him backstage
for, like, a second. [chuckles]

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.977
Well, um, I guess met isn't really
the right word.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.229
'Cause I had to run off and see you,

01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:21.065
but he seemed really nice.

01:04:21.148 --> 01:04:23.359
I didn't really recognize him at first.

01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:28.489
Um... Oh, uh...

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:31.200
Hey, there's no rush here.
You know, I just got here.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.912
Maybe we can just, um, hang out?

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.373
We are hanging out.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.959
I...

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:43.921
Yeah, but, um, I meant...
I meant more like, um...

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:46.048
talk, like, maybe we can talk.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.301
We've been talking for a month.
What's left to talk about?

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:52.013
[stammers] I don't know.
Your life? Your family?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.308
Why do you want to talk about my family?

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.354
I just, um...

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:05.610
[stammering] I don't want this.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.528
I don't want this. I don't want this.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:08.946
What? What do you want?

01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:13.075
What did you think was gonna happen?

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:15.077
[inaudible]

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.506
Hey, is this seat taken?

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:57.388
Man, what are you doing
stuck in VIP with all these jokers?

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.642
Don't you know there's
a huge party going on?

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:09.859
Look, I know this is none of my business,
but that's not a deal.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:12.570
-What?
-Fucking Avilo. That's not a deal.

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:13.988
That's what he does.

01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:17.742
He gets a bunch of younger artists
and he collaborates with them.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:21.287
He uses his name. He keeps all the money.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.499
Trust me, I know.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:29.045
I know from personal experience.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:32.214
You're a man, all right. Don't cry.
You're a fucking man!

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:35.051
-All right, so what do I do?
-I think I can help you.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.972
[clamoring]

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.774
I feel like such an idiot. [scoffs]

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.650
I thought I could play the perfect set

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.652
and everything would fall into place.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.863
-That's not what happened?
-No.

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:59.158
[scoffs] Pretty much the opposite
of that happened.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.744
Well, maybe you're not a very good DJ.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.329
-What?
-I don't know,

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:07.166
maybe you should try to do something else.
Something like real estate.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.210
Who the fuck are you, dude?

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:11.378
You show up out of nowhere
like some mystery guru guy

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:13.964
who's supposed to give me
some life-affirming advice,

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:15.216
and that's the best you got?

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:19.595
[scoffs]

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:22.848
My mom wanted to be a singer
more than anything in her life.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.768
But she had me when she was 18,
and you know what? She gave up.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:28.895
-'Cause she thought that was unrealistic.
-Yeah, it is.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.023
Fuck realistic.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.443
Look, I'm a great fucking DJ.
This music means everything to me.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:35.944
I'm not gonna let it all slip away

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:39.740
just 'cause things aren't panning out
exactly the way I expect them to.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.618
All right.

01:08:44.995 --> 01:08:46.831
I think you should go dance.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.541
What?

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:49.707
[chuckles softly]

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:53.045
I think if you go out there,
many things will become clear for you.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.756
That's the beauty of it, man.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.634
I created this festival
because I like to dance.

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:01.636
I mean, dancing, it's important.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:03.764
[cell phone chimes]

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:05.140
[Anders] Oh, shit.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.560
[laughs]

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:11.772
And so is connecting with old friends.

01:09:14.066 --> 01:09:15.401
Get out there, man.

01:09:24.033 --> 01:09:26.203
[music playing indistinctly]

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.715
[Shannie] I knew I heard something.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.094
Come on, this way.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:44.721
It's over here.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.268
Hey! Hey, pretty girl.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.270
You... [sniffs] You lost this, huh?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.189
How did...

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:58.152
I... I didn't lose it. I... threw it away.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:05.159
We're in the center of the universe.
You can't throw anything away. Like...

01:10:06.493 --> 01:10:09.038
If it's meant to find you, it finds you.
I tried...

01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:12.499
I tried to throw my shoes away,
but they keep coming back.

01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:16.545
[mutters] They keep coming back.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.964
[chuckles] Okay, well...

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:21.675
Well, I...

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:23.928
Not that it makes any difference,

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:26.096
but I think this is meant
for someone else.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.141
Yeah. Your soul mate?

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.810
I met him. I met him earlier.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.980
Average height,
uh, blondish-brownish hair.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.816
He... he was carrying too much stuff!

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:40.402
[laughing]

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.321
I think you're confused.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.492
Don't forget to enjoy the party!

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:50.079
You'll be home, sitting
in front of the computer soon enough.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.458
[Shannie] We're gonna get out of here.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.710
[shrieks gleefully]

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.754
-No way!
-Yeah!

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.801
-[Shannie exclaims]
-Oh! I'm going.

01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:07.221
[Shannie sing-song] Salvation!

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.850
[Ray muttering]

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.103
-[loud music playing]
-[Ray exclaims]

01:11:15.187 --> 01:11:17.273
Come on, let's go. We're gonna miss it.

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:24.446
[crowd cheering]

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:57.873
[crowd cheering]

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.158
-[both] Oh, my God!
-[both chuckle]

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.952
I love your song!

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:37.329
What?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.914
I love your song!

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:41.834
What?

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.585
I still love your song!

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:46.004
Thank you.

01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:58.142
Krystal!
We have been looking all over for you!

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:00.352
We got kicked out of VIP looking for you.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.772
Come on, we want to get
a good spot for Avilo!

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.566
Come on, come on. Let's go!

01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:07.234
[girls cheering]

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:26.879
No, man, I told you,

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.006
I don't want that shit
so close to my fucking face.

01:14:29.089 --> 01:14:32.050
Guess what? It's fucking hot.
You want me to look sweaty?

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:35.012
You want him to go out there and faint?
Is that what you want?

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:37.222
I can't do it.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.557
[both] What?

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.101
I really appreciate the offer.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:44.188
It's the most amazing opportunity
I've had in my life,

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:46.815
and maybe the most amazing one
I ever will have,

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.693
but I just think my priorities
are a little bit--

01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:51.028
Slow down for a second, kid.

01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:53.489
Just think about what you're doing here.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:55.282
I'm in this because I love it,

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:57.993
not because I want to take shortcuts
to make money.

01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.536
[chuckles]

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.497
It's a joke, right?

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.457
-I want to work with my best friend.
-Oh, Jesus!

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.417
If the only deal you'll make
doesn't involve him,

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.543
then I'm sorry, but...

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:08.086
-I'm gonna have to--
-Ethan, stop.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.214
Ethan, stop. Stop, dude. It's a mistake!

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:12.299
I don't want to hold you back.

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:14.718
If doing the deal without me
is what you have to do,

01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:16.220
-that's what you gotta do.
-Tariq...

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.513
I am so sorry that I fucked up.

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.224
This guy doesn't want to help you,
he wants to use you.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:21.308
-Tariq. Tariq.
-Ethan...

01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:23.060
Dude, I wanna be your manager,

01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.187
but more than that,
I wanna be your best friend.

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.814
Tariq! I didn't take the deal.

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:31.610
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
This Care Bear is your fucking manager?

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.529
-[Chopper] Rainbow Brite, here?
-You didn't?

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:34.655
No.

01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:36.490
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:38.992
Why is he here?

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.119
He helped me get back here
so I could talk to you

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.454
and stop you from making this mistake.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.457
-Man, Ethan, I am so, so sorry.
-Man, it's okay.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.708
[Avilo] Hey!

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.460
Shut up, okay?

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.297
You wanna blow this chance, fine.
That's up to you.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.467
There's a million other bedroom DJs
just like you.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.635
-Millions!
-Yeah.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.929
Do you hear that? Wait, do you hear it?

01:15:59.012 --> 01:16:01.139
-Yeah. I own these people.
-[Chopper] We own these people!

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.350
I'm the king
of this motherfucking kingdom, baby.

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.143
-Lion's den, yo.
-Yeah, that's right.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.895
Guess what?
You're gonna have to enjoy

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.897
a lifetime of your mom singing
on your tracks

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:11.567
-to the audience in your bedroom.
-[Chopper] To your broke ass.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.485
[Avilo] 'Cause that's all
you're gonna ever do.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.529
-Yeah, you're done. [groans]
-Whoa!

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:17.948
[Avilo] Whoa, hey, security!

01:16:18.031 --> 01:16:19.700
I've wanted to do that for so long.

01:16:19.783 --> 01:16:21.285
What the fuck was that?

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.662
-Faggot! Get the fuck out!
-Fuck you!

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.872
Get him out of here!
Where the fuck were you?

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:27.332
-Escort him out of the building.
-Chopper!

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.084
-Get him, motherfucker!
-Try that with me.

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:32.129
-Chill, Chopper. Easy.
-[Chopper] Try that shit with me.

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:33.505
-Chill out. Get him out.
-[Avilo] Pussy!

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:34.840
Get the fuck out of here!

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.008
-Escort him out.
-Let's go, bitch!

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.302
-Try that shit with me.
-Hey, hey.

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:40.429
Hey, hey! Relax.

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:43.599
-Let's get back to your trailer.
-I got this.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:44.766
-Cool off.
-Fucking faggot!

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.269
Let's cool off.
When did you become a homophobe?

01:16:47.352 --> 01:16:49.146
You see, we paid for this bus, right?

01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:51.565
And it broke down,
and there was this riot.

01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:52.774
And we lost our tickets.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.235
We were in this sewer tunnel forever--

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:57.321
Everyone's stretching out
my fucking shirt.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.780
Is this a festival
of stretching out shirts?

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.616
[Shannie] We have to get in. You don't--

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:04.244
That is the dick who left us
on the side of the road.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.996
-Yep.
-I was telling you the truth!

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:07.998
[stammers] Yeah, I'm sorry. Really, I am.

01:17:08.081 --> 01:17:11.752
Ow! Hey, what the fuck?
You guys smell like... Are you...

01:17:11.835 --> 01:17:14.421
That's the worst smell...
You guys smell fucking dead!

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:17.716
It smells like a fucking shit... shit.
Like you shit eggs.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.343
-That is nasty.
-Did you shit on them?

01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:21.511
You know, thanks for everything.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.096
Did the fucking security guy shit on you?

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.599
You provided the service
you claimed to provide.

01:17:25.682 --> 01:17:27.142
-I mean... [scoffs]
-No, actually.

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:28.477
-I feel grateful.
-Have a great life.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.853
The boss said you could come back.

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:31.938
All right. Hold on.
Wait, one second. Whoa!

01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:35.817
Don't do extra arm movements,
'cause the smell comes over, but...

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:39.905
Uh, can you ask
if I can bring my friends with me?

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:42.908
-They're covered in shit.
-I know, but just...

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:46.745
Come with us, but stay that far away.
But come with us.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.289
But let me go first.
Let me walk first. Come on.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.583
What the hell are we doing?

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.044
We're gonna steal the set. Go, go, go.

01:17:54.127 --> 01:17:55.170
[Ethan] Shit.

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:56.588
Holy shit.

01:17:57.714 --> 01:17:59.383
Holy shit!
Dude, what the fuck are we doing?

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:01.051
I said we're gonna steal the set.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.762
[crowd cheering]

01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:06.765
Dude, no, no, no.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:08.767
This is your moment. You gotta grab it.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.689
No. Dude, I can't.
Blowing it at Lolita was bad enough.

01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.941
But this? No, I... I can't do it.

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:19.444
Ethan, what did I say to you?

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.696
You deserve to be here.

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.030
Now, are you gonna commit to this,

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:24.324
or chicken out and sit at home
with your grandma?

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:28.412
We came here so you could play.
So now, go fucking play.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.372
I can't do it. Tariq, I can't do it.

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:33.625
-I believe in you completely.
-No, I literally can't do it.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:37.212
I don't have my equipment,
or any of my music, or any of that shit.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.426
Tariq, you know that shit's not ready.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.720
This is the one thing that I did not lose

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:48.849
while I got swept up in a riot,
I died of a drug overdose,

01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:52.811
I went to hell, I was seduced
and then attacked by aliens,

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:55.647
and I had the spiritual experience
of swimming in the bloodstream

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.233
of an enormous supernatural toilet.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:01.528
Yes, the tracks are ready.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:03.947
You are ready.

01:19:05.365 --> 01:19:07.200
Please do this journey justice.

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:16.585
I'm still mad at you.

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.172
I love you!

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.730
[crowd cheering]

01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:50.202
I'm not Avilo.

My name's Ethan Shaw.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.372
I hope that's okay.

Neil Berg hit me in the fucking face!

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.070
I thought you said that dude was dead.

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.863
It was a fucking metaphor, man!

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.074
I meant
that his fucking relevance was dead.

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:31.660
All right. Chill.
You good enough to play?

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:32.702
You gotta get out there.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:36.456

What the fuck is that?

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.552
-Just fucking open it.
-I'm trying to.

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:51.888
-Open the fucking door, Chopper.
-It's fucking locked!

-Chill out, man.
-You shut the fuck up!

01:20:58.228 --> 01:21:00.355
I'm calling. I'm taking care of it.

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:02.148
-God! Fucking shit.
-I'm on it. Hello?

Oh, shoot!

Hey, guys!
Guys, don't worry about them, all right?

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.388
Stand down. I got this.

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:17.599
[Neil] That was amazing, right?

01:22:17.682 --> 01:22:20.310
I know you at least
liked that a little bit.

01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:22.938
[chuckles] Yeah, your little buddies
just hijacked Avilo's set.

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.315
Someone is definitely gonna be
suing my ass.

01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:28.610
Well, that's what you have
fucking big lawyers for, right?

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:31.154
Uh...

I'm sorry, you know, about, like--

Not necessary, man. We're good.

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:39.162
I've been a baby
about the whole fucking thing, but it's...

01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:42.332
Well, I think it's cool that...
I mean...
