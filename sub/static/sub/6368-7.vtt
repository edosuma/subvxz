You've lost control of your

She was in trouble.
She needed guidance.

And the time is coming
for her to be on her own.

22:14.164 --> 22:15.832

- Yes.
- What are you gonna do when you find him?

53:27.677 --> 53:29.778
What you couldn't.

53:35.985 --> 53:40.815
- Look, I know this is hard for you.
- No, the boy I knew is dead.

53:40.850 --> 53:43.658
<i>That day in the woods,
I looked into his eyes</i>

53:44.093 --> 53:46.427
<i>and he would have killed me
without a second thought.</i>

53:46.795 --> 53:50.231
<i>Whoever he once was, 
he's a stone-cold killer now</i>

53:50.499 --> 53:52.700
<i>and he needs to be put down.</i>

53:53.034 --> 53:54.907
I just can't be there
to watch it happen.

54:18.492 --> 54:20.527
Take care of yourself, Sheriff.

54:24.565 --> 54:26.132
- Hey, Brock.
- Hmm?

54:26.334 --> 54:30.537
- Cover for me.
- Sorry, can't do it.

54:30.705 --> 54:32.739
What?

54:35.375 --> 54:38.019
Because I'm going 
with you to New Orleans.

54:41.149 --> 54:43.582
[sighs]
I'll drive.
