02:30.183 --> 02:31.851

I'd recognize you.

- Tell him.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.713
Tell him

03:34.714 --> 03:37.584
why you came back.

03:44.958 --> 03:45.958
- Dad,

03:49.462 --> 03:50.462
I forgive you.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.485
- I gotta do another quick hop

04:46.486 --> 04:48.320
before the weather changes.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.588
- Will I see you?

04:49.589 --> 04:51.356
- Yeah, you'll see me tonight.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.625
I live in that boat now.

05:04.771 --> 05:05.771
Hey, pops.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.074
Tell Jen's dad she's here.

05:22.955 --> 05:23.823
Hey, you need a hand?

05:23.823 --> 05:24.823
- No, I'm good.

05:36.869 --> 05:37.869
Thanks.

05:46.779 --> 05:47.779
Hi.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.485
Hey, Jewel.

05:56.989 --> 05:58.358
Come on puppy it's me.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.699
Linda, do you remember me?

06:09.001 --> 06:10.636
I'm your sister Jenibel.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.612
I'm sorry I've
been gone so long.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.715
- You look different.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.121
- Well, I missed you.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.725
- Well, it's not like
we've been hiding.

06:34.427 --> 06:35.495
- How are you, Neil?

06:36.696 --> 06:37.597
- Busy.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.600
Pretty much run things
around here now.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.973
- It's good to see you.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.443
- I was starting to think you
were never gonna come back.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.547
- So is dad in a lot of pain?

06:57.116 --> 06:58.984
- Well, I don't think
he feels anything

06:58.985 --> 07:00.119
except maybe thirsty.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.656
He's always been thirsty.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.193
For Christ's sake.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.596
Pilot boy just dumps them here.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.666
There's a storm coming and
he just leaves them outside.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.802
Hey, Andre

07:17.203 --> 07:19.005
supplies front dock.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.576
Place would fall apart
without me here.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.511
Fall apart.

07:26.546 --> 07:27.612
- I can help with those.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.448
- Ah, don't be stupid.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.150
You got your own bag
to carry sister.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.054
- You coming.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.088
- She'll follow.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.191
- Come on Jewel.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.104
- Feels different.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.091
- You find your own way up.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.092
Same room.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.065
- I wanna see him.

08:32.979 --> 08:33.979
Do you wanna come?

08:39.018 --> 08:40.219
You don't have to do that.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.711
- The prodigal daughter

09:08.548 --> 09:10.249
returned at long last.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.887
- Bruce pick you up on time?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.326
- He did.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.597
- How long you
gonna be here for?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.568
- For what the doctor's say.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.202
- Bert's the only
doctor up here.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.271
One's plenty.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.874
- You're right about
that one son.

09:36.809 --> 09:40.646
Neil, I need to talk
to your sister.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.317
Why don't you check
on our guest.

10:10.710 --> 10:14.680
Christ you grew right
into your mother.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.217
You should be happy.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.720
You didn't grew into me.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.154
- I am.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.194
- Are you disappointed I'm not

10:29.195 --> 10:31.363
lying in bed rolling
around in pain?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.331
Is that why you're here

10:33.332 --> 10:35.333
to see the death rattle?

10:35.334 --> 10:38.303
- I'm here because you
told me you were dying.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.405
- Well,

10:40.740 --> 10:42.174
I do appreciate that.

10:44.243 --> 10:45.344
It's a big ticket.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.387
- Dad, there's something I've
been wanting to say to you.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.756
- Don't.
- No, I need to.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.425
- It's not necessary
I forgive you.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.826
- What?

11:01.827 --> 11:03.896
- You're here now that's
all that matters.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.667
I need a nap. - Are you serious?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.268
You know how many
years it's been.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.836
- Yes, okay, okay.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.838
We can talk about it later.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.007
But I need some sleep.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.173
- Hello, Andre.

11:49.842 --> 11:50.842
How are you doing?

11:52.912 --> 11:54.813
- You should be aware
that dinner for guests

11:54.814 --> 11:56.815
is promptly at seven o'clock.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.484
- Well, I'd like to that I'm
more than just a guest.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.922
- No, you're not just a guest.

12:05.758 --> 12:06.758
- Louisa alright?

12:36.789 --> 12:39.191
Is that mom's record player.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.363
Looks the same.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.208
- I like it the same.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.111
- Thank you for
bringing my bag up.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.114
- You aren't gonna
stay home now.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.252
- I can't live here anymore.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.254
You happy here?

13:09.255 --> 13:10.389
- It's boring.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.992
- Yeah.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.460
Well, at least I like to swim.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.430
Because I remember somebody
was a very good swimmer.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.099
- The water's too cold now.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.434
- I guess summer is over, huh?

13:23.803 --> 13:24.870
- Gold rush.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.141
- They still do that.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.585
Thanks.

13:46.859 --> 13:47.859
Hello.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.563
- Well, all grown up now.

13:53.599 --> 13:57.101
- I didn't know the ladies
ventured this far north.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.469
- A little lost from
the flock, Randy.

13:58.470 --> 13:59.571
- Be good boys.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.839
- Hey, welcome home.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.106
- Thank you.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.942
- Now you probably
don't remember us.

14:03.943 --> 14:04.943
Joe Bananali.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.246
This is Randal Peters.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.181
- I think I do remember.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.851
It's nice to see you both again.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.558
Hey, Louisa.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.437
You know you used to
be the one who would

14:32.438 --> 14:35.139
serve the drinks up
on nights like these.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.242
Do you remember that?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.549
- She's, uh.
- I gathered.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.252
Still looks beautiful though.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.419
- Jenibel.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.489
Jenibel Elizabeth Heath

14:51.490 --> 14:54.259
as the holy Jesus
Christ is my witness

14:54.260 --> 14:56.895
I never thought we'd see
you in these parts again.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.196
Pleasure. - Dr. Morrison

14:58.197 --> 14:59.564
it's good to see you.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.332
- Bert, you can
call me Bert now.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.601
- Doctor are you
drinking this evening?

15:03.602 --> 15:05.938
- Given the circumstances
I think I will.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.107
To the hive.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.108
To family.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.211
- Family.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.216
- It's a bit rocky.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.084
- It just needs more
honey that's all.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.520
Andre. - Thank you.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.524
- You know what we're missing.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.527
What was that song your
mother taught you?

15:29.528 --> 15:31.596
That lovely song you
always used to play.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.631
- A Gold Rush Serenade.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.534
Yeah, I hated that song.

15:36.535 --> 15:37.535
- Play it.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.973
- I just said I hated it.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.375
- It was a gift mother gave you.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.111
A gift to be shared.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.480
- Come on.
- Okay.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.683
Okay.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.520
Hold the applause I am
probably gonna mess this up.

16:14.406 --> 16:15.406
- She's got it.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.176

17:49.068 --> 17:50.102
- How was your nap?

17:51.804 --> 17:53.439
- Natalie.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.513
Natalie, they told
me you were dead.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.116
- Ma, that's not Natalie.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.252
- You still play so beautifully.

18:10.389 --> 18:14.159
- Thank you but I'm Jenibel.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.864
Natalie was my mom remember.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.100
- They told me you
killed yourself.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.768
- But I'm Jenibel.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.171
- But if you're dead how can
you have a little girl?

18:27.172 --> 18:29.141
Is Linda your little girl?

18:30.175 --> 18:31.542
- Do something for Christ sake.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.678
- Bruce, help your mother.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.380
- Ma, why don't you
sit down okay.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.381
Have a seat.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.355
- Jesus, Jenny

18:44.523 --> 18:46.525
you sure know how
to stir things up.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.165
- Andre, can I have
something else to drink?

18:54.166 --> 18:56.901
- No, you most certainly cannot.

18:56.902 --> 19:00.138
This is what we
serve at the hive.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.440
This is it nothing else.

19:02.441 --> 19:03.441
- Dad,

19:04.643 --> 19:05.878
why don't you just sit.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.919
- Cowardly but caring son.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.189
A vengeful daughter.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.691
Even a wonderful little angel.

19:20.692 --> 19:24.595
- You know Marv there's a
time for being an asshole

19:24.596 --> 19:26.898
and there's a time for
drinking your drink

19:26.899 --> 19:30.334
You're old enough to know
the difference come on.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.936
- Oh, Bert.

19:31.937 --> 19:32.937
Bert.

19:34.773 --> 19:38.809
I only have so
much asshole left.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.245
It's a precious commodity.

19:42.915 --> 19:43.915
You see gentleman

19:46.318 --> 19:47.318
my wife

19:49.955 --> 19:51.623
she abandoned me in this life

19:55.227 --> 19:57.863
and what'd she leave me

19:58.830 --> 20:00.666
besides this beautiful island?

20:05.837 --> 20:07.973
The honey, our family honey

20:09.608 --> 20:12.510
sweetness from a
million tiny flowers

20:12.511 --> 20:16.814
a thousand busy workers
down our thirsty throats

20:16.815 --> 20:18.250
and into our blood.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.921
We are not just tying one on.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.526
We are metabolizing our home.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.261
- Don't you think you've
metabolized enough

20:30.262 --> 20:32.264
for one day, dad?

20:34.399 --> 20:35.866
- I never raised her to be rude

20:35.867 --> 20:37.268
so there must be
something to this

20:37.269 --> 20:40.004
environmental influence
we hear so much about.

20:40.005 --> 20:43.241
- You didn't raise me at all.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.375
You shipped me off to England.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.444
- I say what I mean.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.013
I only say what's true.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.282
- Alright, well then why
don't you tell everyone

20:51.283 --> 20:54.553
why mom killed herself say
what's true about that.

21:29.321 --> 21:30.988
- I need you to get up
and come out front.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.291
- Why?

21:35.861 --> 21:36.861
- Now.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.063
- Where are you going?

21:39.698 --> 21:41.032
- Well, be back soon.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.034
Go back to sleep, honey.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.036
I love you.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.950
- Put the suit on.

21:59.951 --> 22:00.852
- No way.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.954
- Put it on I don't
want you getting stung.

22:03.955 --> 22:06.557
- No, I'm not going
near those things.

22:06.558 --> 22:09.627
- I'm asking you as nicely
as I am capable of.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.930
Please put on the damn suit.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.472
Honey is the only
part of the business

22:21.473 --> 22:23.040
that still makes a profit.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.410
- Oh, no that bad, huh.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.781
- Seems like hunting for one's
food has gone out of style.

22:31.883 --> 22:32.883
Jenny,

22:34.052 --> 22:35.387
grab the veil.

22:44.496 --> 22:45.564
Those are

22:47.065 --> 22:50.568
what we affectionately
call our ruby red.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.537
I made a bad batch
fermental last year.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.139
I mean it really went sideways.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.575
It's poisonous as hell.

22:57.943 --> 23:01.679
A spoon full will make you
sick fever, hallucinations.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.013
Half a cup probably kill ya.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.483
- Why keep it?

23:05.550 --> 23:07.017
- Are you kidding?

23:07.018 --> 23:09.120
You know what it takes to
make a batch of honey.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.788
It's a whole lifetime for a bee.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.792
You don't just take it away
from him and destroy it.

23:14.893 --> 23:15.893
- Really?

23:18.497 --> 23:19.497
- I use it

23:20.532 --> 23:24.603
to kill squirrels and
raccoons and such.

23:26.171 --> 23:30.641
All the creatures they
want my wonderful honey.

23:30.642 --> 23:31.977
- What are we doing, dad?

24:15.020 --> 24:17.154
- We received a generous offer

24:17.155 --> 24:20.058
to buy the hive the
entire parcel.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.193
- You've received offers before.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.795
You're never gonna
sell this place.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.732
- You think you know
everything always have.

24:35.707 --> 24:36.707
Whoa.

24:37.542 --> 24:38.542
Whoa.

24:40.545 --> 24:43.147
Time to breach the
fiery gates of hell.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.650
Time to set everyone free.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.553
- I don't think Neil really
wants to be set free.

24:49.554 --> 24:50.721
- Neil.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.256
Neil isn't fully formed.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.858
The boy needs rescuing

24:53.859 --> 24:55.660
and I'm gonna do just that.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.666
Put on the mask.

25:06.638 --> 25:07.572
- What about you?

25:07.573 --> 25:11.176
- I am gonna be just fine.

25:18.149 --> 25:19.518
I know you hate me, Jenny.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.553
- What are you doing?

25:22.554 --> 25:24.288
- I need you to
promise me something.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.657
- Stop it, dad.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.691
Open the gate.

25:28.994 --> 25:32.530
- I need you to accept the
offer and sell this place.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.031
- No.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.966
- Promise me, Jenny.

25:35.967 --> 25:38.235
- You sell it if you want to.
- Promise me.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.071
- Get out of there.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.908
- I'm sorry, Jenny.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.877
- Hey, you're acting insane.

25:47.245 --> 25:48.713
Dad.

25:50.315 --> 25:51.315
Dad.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.284
Jesus.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.956
I can stop it.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.325
I promise.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.698
- Come on.

26:10.602 --> 26:11.602
Come on.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.606
Come on.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.310
- Dad.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.250
Dad.

26:30.622 --> 26:33.792
Dad, give me your key please.

26:37.062 --> 26:38.062
Linda.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.299
Linda get back.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.870
Linda, go get help.

26:46.871 --> 26:47.871
Dad.

26:49.374 --> 26:51.610
Dad, give me the key.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.851
Why are you doing this to me?

27:09.628 --> 27:10.628
Daddy.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.952
- Well, bastard
finally imploded.

28:14.292 --> 28:15.325
- Jesus.

28:15.326 --> 28:16.394
- Did you see him, Bert?

28:20.899 --> 28:22.300
- Yeah, yeah.

28:24.402 --> 28:27.172
Just don't understand.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.406
- Well, dad was never
gonna die in bed.

28:29.407 --> 28:32.177
He always said he'd
kill himself first.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.348
- I'm gonna need
some help with body.

28:38.349 --> 28:39.751
Should I ask Andre?

28:41.052 --> 28:42.486
- No, I'll do it.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.254
- What are you
gonna do with him?

28:44.255 --> 28:47.091
- We'll put him in the
gun shed for now.

28:47.092 --> 28:49.861
- It's where we
keep dead animals.

29:28.299 --> 29:29.467
- Can you sit down for me?

29:34.005 --> 29:35.073
Linda, what you saw

29:41.079 --> 29:42.514
daddy died today.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.851
- Daddy was mad.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.019
Always mad.

29:50.488 --> 29:51.488
- I know.

29:53.424 --> 29:54.492
Not anymore.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.897
Linda, things are gonna
be different now

30:00.231 --> 30:03.968
and that means that some
things might have to change.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.239
Can you be a brave girl?

30:09.841 --> 30:11.376
Can you let things change?

30:14.813 --> 30:15.813
- Yes.

30:17.448 --> 30:18.516
- Good girl.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.460
- But the darkness is real.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.916
- My baby.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.320
- Mom.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.659
- You shouldn't play
near the hives' honey.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.560
- I didn't mean to mommy.

32:10.561 --> 32:11.995
I'm sorry.

32:11.996 --> 32:13.598
- Sorry changes nothing.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.369
- Why did you do it, mom?

32:21.506 --> 32:23.007
Why?

32:32.116 --> 32:34.652
I'm sorry please don't leave me.

32:36.587 --> 32:37.989
- Jenny.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.996
- Why did you leave us?

32:56.474 --> 32:57.975
- Did you get her down okay?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.644
- Yeah, yeah she's fine.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.745
Are you?

33:01.746 --> 33:03.147
- I really don't know.

33:04.248 --> 33:05.282
- I came as soon as I could.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.583
I am so sorry, Jenny.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.453
- Did you see fireworks tonight?

33:11.255 --> 33:13.458
- Yeah, yeah those idiots.

33:14.659 --> 33:18.362
I dropped them off yesterday
up river for a photo safari.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.697
I guess nature wasn't
photogenic enough.

33:20.698 --> 33:22.667
Hey, have a seat.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.713
- I thought...

33:38.750 --> 33:41.319
I thought Louisa was my mother.

33:53.664 --> 33:58.102
My aunt made me see a
therapist for a little while.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.774
I was having what she
called waking dreams.

34:05.109 --> 34:06.744
- Is that what you had tonight?

34:10.782 --> 34:12.215
Well, you've always been the

34:12.216 --> 34:14.085
well adjusted one
in your family.

34:17.422 --> 34:21.125
- I never got the
chance to forgive him.

34:33.603 --> 34:37.841
I should get some sleep
at least try to.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.509
- Okay.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.411
- Thank you for listening.

34:45.483 --> 34:46.483
I'm fine.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.395
- Jenibel.

34:58.396 --> 34:59.396
My baby.

35:00.231 --> 35:01.798
My girl where are you?

35:01.799 --> 35:05.102
Please we wrestle with the flesh

35:05.103 --> 35:07.170
with the darkness
in the darkness,

35:07.171 --> 35:09.206
the darkness that is real.

35:09.207 --> 35:11.842
That is for you.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.611
I miss you not in the flesh

35:14.612 --> 35:17.181
but the darkness that is real.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.264
- Here start with this.

35:34.265 --> 35:35.265
- Hmm.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.201
That smells delicious.

35:39.337 --> 35:41.338
- So I was thinking we could
spend the day together.

35:41.339 --> 35:42.572
You know maybe once
the weather clears

35:42.573 --> 35:43.774
take a flight up river.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.819
- Bruce, I have to
deal with things here

35:56.521 --> 35:59.556
and I need to go back home.

35:59.557 --> 36:00.790
- Yeah, all right.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.460
We can check the weather
after breakfast, okay.

36:03.461 --> 36:04.529
- Thank you.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.741
- Well, I am not
an estate lawyer.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.912
But your father changed his
will couple of weeks ago

36:21.913 --> 36:24.882
and timing makes sense now.

36:27.652 --> 36:29.319
He asked me to execute

36:29.320 --> 36:30.921
and so now that Jenna's here

36:30.922 --> 36:34.926
it seems like as good a time
as any so I will execute.

36:36.627 --> 36:40.798
Now I'm not gonna read
this legal mumbo jumbo.

36:41.966 --> 36:45.769
The gist of it is that the
two of you split everything,

36:45.770 --> 36:50.208
the business, the land, the
assets and also the debts.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.942
- What debts?

36:51.943 --> 36:55.980
- I don't know Neil but I
understand there are some debts.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.852
- Well, I know you don't have
any interest in this place.

37:03.454 --> 37:06.524
I'll find a way to
buy you out okay.

37:08.459 --> 37:12.697
- Neil, the terms of
the split are 51/49.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.602
Yeah, 51 to Jenibel.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.907
So what that means is the
two of you own everything

37:23.908 --> 37:26.010
but Jenibel has a
controlling interest.

37:26.944 --> 37:30.014
Any major decisions are
ultimately hers to make.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.317
Your father wanted
you to be in charge

37:34.318 --> 37:38.556
so that you could fulfill
verbal promises says here.

37:40.024 --> 37:41.592
Don't know what that means.

37:43.561 --> 37:44.996
- Wait a goddamn minute.

37:45.997 --> 37:46.931
- Neil.
- Yeah, well

37:46.932 --> 37:48.598
I'm sorry Neil but that's...

37:48.599 --> 37:50.501
- I'm the one that's been
here this whole time.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.902
I'm the one that's
run this place.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.604
- We know that son.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.907
But unfortunately your father's
wishes are very clear.

37:57.908 --> 38:01.512
He wants Jenibel in
charge legally at least.

38:03.447 --> 38:07.685
And I'm afraid that's
really all there is to say

38:09.754 --> 38:12.455
lest you have any questions.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.456
- Yeah.

38:14.392 --> 38:15.692
Yeah, I have a question.

38:15.693 --> 38:17.661
- Yeah, I thought you might.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.765
- I mean since I'm
an orphan and all.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.407
Please may I have some more?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.412
Please, sir may I
have some more?

38:35.579 --> 38:38.549
Please, sir may I have
some goddamn more?

38:55.566 --> 38:57.101
- This is so unfair.

38:58.402 --> 39:00.403
He should've just
sold the place.

39:00.404 --> 39:01.372
- Well, he couldn't.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.839
When your mother died she gave

39:02.840 --> 39:04.507
the place to him in trust only.

39:04.508 --> 39:07.510
Her will stipulated he was
not allowed to sell it

39:07.511 --> 39:09.447
only to pass it on
to the children.

39:10.981 --> 39:15.419
- Now he's dead so it
can be sold by me.

39:16.420 --> 39:19.890
- Well, Jenibel your mother...

39:21.492 --> 39:23.660
- I should make
sure Neil's okay.

39:23.661 --> 39:26.430
Thank you for handling this.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.432
- Right, right.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.139
- Neil.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.650
Neil.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.437
- How did you stand right here?

41:01.525 --> 41:04.595
Don't leave me alone.

41:44.201 --> 41:45.201
- Dad.

41:47.872 --> 41:48.872
Dad.

42:08.592 --> 42:11.028
- Whoa, what the Christ
happened to you?

42:13.130 --> 42:16.299
- I just got a bit lost
in the woods I'm fine.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.536
- Here put this on you
must be freezing.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.206
I said thank you. - Yeah.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.912
It's just terrible.

42:28.913 --> 42:31.282
We don't understand
how could anybody...

42:34.151 --> 42:35.919
- I mean this probably
isn't a good time.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.620
But we do need to talk to you

42:37.621 --> 42:40.691
about some business that
we had with your dad.

42:44.261 --> 42:46.096
- You are the buyers.

42:47.298 --> 42:49.600
- We have a deal that's
pretty much closed, yes.

42:57.708 --> 42:58.708
- Okay.

43:00.811 --> 43:01.811
Okay.

43:35.679 --> 43:37.681
- Do you wanna learn?

43:38.949 --> 43:39.984
- Yes, please.

43:44.254 --> 43:48.257
- Alright so your
part is pretty easy

43:48.258 --> 43:50.360
so give me this hand

43:50.361 --> 43:54.297
and we go one and
then two three.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.332
Just like that keep doing that.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.735
One, two, three.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.705
My part.

44:13.784 --> 44:15.285
- Is this what
grieving sounds like?

44:26.664 --> 44:29.366
- We'll, practice
more later okay?

44:41.812 --> 44:43.313
- I heard you got scraped up.

44:44.314 --> 44:45.983
Are you okay?

44:48.252 --> 44:50.353
- I guess you think it's
kind of childish of me

44:50.354 --> 44:51.388
taking off like that.

44:53.924 --> 44:55.458
- Be nice if you'd remember

44:55.459 --> 44:57.261
that I haven't done
anything wrong.

44:58.929 --> 45:01.899
- Peter and Bananali they wanna
buy this place don't they?

45:04.835 --> 45:05.835
- Yeah.

45:06.904 --> 45:09.405
They made dad an offer.

45:09.406 --> 45:10.841
- Well, they're snakes.

45:17.147 --> 45:19.216
- Why don't we talk
to them together.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.753
- There's nothing to talk about.

45:23.754 --> 45:24.754
- Neil.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.125
Neil.

45:30.961 --> 45:33.197
Before he died

45:34.832 --> 45:36.800
dad made me promise
him something.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.138
He made me swear I
would sell the lot.

45:57.755 --> 46:01.792
- This could be a new
beginning for everyone.

46:04.261 --> 46:05.261
It's what he wanted.

46:15.139 --> 46:16.507
We'll, figure it out.

46:33.857 --> 46:37.026
Well, let's talk about what you
guys want with this place.

46:37.027 --> 46:38.194
- I mean do you guys even know

46:38.195 --> 46:40.329
how to run an
operation like this?

46:40.330 --> 46:42.498
No, of course you don't.

46:42.499 --> 46:44.801
- We're not gonna be running it.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.503
- Neil, the one thing that we
really admired about your dad

46:47.504 --> 46:50.339
was that he spoke plain right.

46:50.340 --> 46:52.975
I mean you didn't always
have to like what he said.

46:52.976 --> 46:54.510
But you know he meant
it when he said it.

46:54.511 --> 46:56.245
- I know what kind of
man my father was.

46:56.246 --> 46:58.981
- Okay, we have been
very up front about

46:58.982 --> 47:00.950
what our intentions are
right from the get go.

47:00.951 --> 47:02.185
We don't want the hive.

47:02.186 --> 47:05.087
We don't wanna be in the
hunting and fishing business.

47:05.088 --> 47:06.824
- This is beautiful territory.

47:07.991 --> 47:09.225
But most of it's protected land.

47:09.226 --> 47:10.960
Now you guys have 35 acres.

47:10.961 --> 47:14.897
Okay, we wanna develop it.

47:14.898 --> 47:17.600
High end cottage
properties we wanna do 10.

47:17.601 --> 47:20.870
- What we're buying and
selling is acreage

47:20.871 --> 47:23.172
on the kind of remote
water side spread

47:23.173 --> 47:27.109
that's kind of rare these days.

47:27.110 --> 47:29.178
We wanna build homes where
we can put families in

47:29.179 --> 47:30.346
for the whole summer.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.951
You guys will be making a
lot of people very happy.

47:35.552 --> 47:38.255
- So what you're just gonna
tear this place down?

47:39.289 --> 47:40.624
- Your dad knew our plans.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.627
- I don't believe it.

47:44.628 --> 47:46.062
Not one word of it.

47:46.063 --> 47:47.364
This is not our dad.

47:48.232 --> 47:50.132
This is not our dad.

47:50.133 --> 47:51.133
- Here Jenny.

47:54.204 --> 47:57.540
- This is all of the
correspondence.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.542
Contract drafts, sales
offers, counter offers

47:59.543 --> 48:01.244
everything is right there.

48:01.245 --> 48:03.247
You dad even did his own
mark up in ball point pen.

48:04.882 --> 48:07.283
He was pretty shrewd
I ought to say.

48:07.284 --> 48:08.451
He went head to head
with our lawyers

48:08.452 --> 48:10.486
and pissed them off plenty.

48:10.487 --> 48:11.622
- It's a generous offer.

48:15.158 --> 48:19.263
Neil, calm down.

48:23.667 --> 48:25.101
- Screw you and screw you.

48:25.102 --> 48:27.403
This is my land our land

48:27.404 --> 48:28.472
and I'm not selling.

48:29.907 --> 48:30.941
I'm not selling.

48:39.416 --> 48:43.086
- I'm gonna need sometime
to look this over.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.628
- Thank you, Jenibel.

50:28.158 --> 50:29.760
- Oh, I've been looking for you.

50:32.062 --> 50:34.097
- Well, you found me.

50:35.732 --> 50:39.403
- Neil told me about those
fellas and their offer.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.738
- Neil is upset.

50:42.739 --> 50:45.442
- Yeah, well you wouldn't
actually do that to us.

50:48.078 --> 50:50.780
- It's what my dad wanted.

50:50.781 --> 50:53.349
He made me promise

50:53.350 --> 50:55.519
that I would sell this place.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.687
- Let me tell you
something this land

50:58.688 --> 51:02.625
has remained pristine since
our families had stayed.

51:02.626 --> 51:05.194
Your family and mine have
been here a long, long time.

51:05.195 --> 51:06.396
- Don't you understand.

51:07.831 --> 51:12.068
The man killed himself
so everyone here

51:12.069 --> 51:14.336
could finally move
on with their lives.

51:14.337 --> 51:16.406
- He was a sick man.

51:19.076 --> 51:22.312
Yeah, what about your
mother's wishes.

51:24.548 --> 51:26.316
- She was never happy here.

51:27.651 --> 51:30.086
She never trusted him.
- You were young.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.654
You didn't understand
what he went through.

51:31.655 --> 51:34.356
Your mother was not well
for a long, long time.

51:34.357 --> 51:35.724
But she did love this place.

51:35.725 --> 51:37.761
She loved it deeply.

51:41.298 --> 51:43.732
I've been up all night long

51:43.733 --> 51:47.369
reviewing everything
I could find.

51:47.370 --> 51:51.608
And what we've inherited
is a lot of debt.

51:53.743 --> 51:55.579
This is a good offer.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.849
- Yeah, well Neil
has some ideas.

51:59.850 --> 52:00.883
- Come on.

52:00.884 --> 52:02.218
- At least hear him out.

52:02.219 --> 52:04.688
- We can't afford Neil's ideas.

52:14.898 --> 52:17.601
- I have intention
of going anywhere.

52:18.768 --> 52:22.138
Jenibel I'm not gonna
let you do this

52:22.139 --> 52:24.674
not to your family
and not to me.

52:30.347 --> 52:31.414
- I'm sorry.

53:28.838 --> 53:31.241
- Think I don't know
what you're doing.

53:34.945 --> 53:35.979
Now you see me.

53:38.315 --> 53:39.315
Now.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.987
First you're one thing
then you're another.

53:46.790 --> 53:49.292
First from behind me then
you're in front of me.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.235
- I don't understand.

54:00.904 --> 54:01.904
- You do.

54:03.373 --> 54:05.442
You do because you made it all.

54:08.612 --> 54:10.814
You made it all
because it fits you.

54:14.317 --> 54:16.019
But it doesn't fit me.

54:19.956 --> 54:21.258
It digs in

54:22.892 --> 54:23.994
and it cuts

54:25.929 --> 54:27.564
and it digs deeper.

54:31.501 --> 54:32.501
- Natalie,

54:33.937 --> 54:35.271
what's going on?

54:35.272 --> 54:37.306
You're not making any sense.

54:37.307 --> 54:38.675
- You're not making sense.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.045
You're not making any sense.

54:46.716 --> 54:48.051
You should die.

54:50.553 --> 54:52.756
I'll make sure you
stay right here

54:56.526 --> 54:57.526
in hell.

54:58.662 --> 55:00.297
Yes, I will.

55:22.786 --> 55:24.354
Where is the love?

55:28.325 --> 55:29.893
Where is the love
in any of this?

55:52.615 --> 55:53.950
- They're gone.

55:55.919 --> 55:57.020
- Who?

55:58.988 --> 56:02.459
Sorry your business associates.

56:05.795 --> 56:09.532
- Well, maybe they're
coming back.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.835
- What are you doing with that?

56:24.013 --> 56:25.614
Nobody takes everything they got

56:25.615 --> 56:27.550
if they're planning
on coming back.

57:24.174 --> 57:25.475
- Hey.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.212
How you holding up?

57:30.213 --> 57:33.049
- Can't face them any of them.

57:43.760 --> 57:47.230
So when did your mom
start to get sick?

57:48.665 --> 57:49.899
- About four years ago.

57:51.067 --> 57:52.067
- I'm sorry.

57:52.068 --> 57:53.703
It's hard to see her like that.

57:56.506 --> 58:00.743
- Sometimes she's with us
back to herself not often.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.250

emotionally disturbing.

58:25.235 --> 58:27.203
I wouldn't wanna change
gears too quickly.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.573
- I'm just curious.

58:32.075 --> 58:34.743
How come you never called
or wrote all those years?

58:34.744 --> 58:38.213
You just kind of
disappeared you know.

58:38.214 --> 58:40.950
- Because you were here.

58:43.887 --> 58:47.122

be poisoning me.

59:43.313 --> 59:44.614

- I know it sounds crazy.

59:53.189 --> 59:55.658

- Why not?

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.972
- There is a hell of
a storm coming in.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.073
You can't fly in it.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.742
I could take you when it's safe.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.488
I was wondering where
you disappeared to.

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:11.894
So this is it the big typhoon?

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:19.969
- So I heard about the will

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:23.438
and the offer.

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.442
- I was gonna tell you.

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:31.781
- It's not my business.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:36.185
- Well, it does affect
you and your parents.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.453

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:39.789
Want some coffee?

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.090

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.193
- Jenibel, do you want
some coffee or not?

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:46.529
- Yes, please.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.518
Thank you.

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.803
- You good.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:32.874
- Actually I think I left
my coat back at your place

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:33.910
and I'm freezing.

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.945
Can you get it for me?

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.215
Please, I'm cold.

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:41.516
- What about breakfast?

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.052
- I'll finish it for you.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.055
Bruce, please it's
the only one I have.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.026
- All right.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:54.330
Alright just don't let it burn.

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.525
- Go.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.926
- Linda.

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:25.595
Linda.

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:27.263
Linda, here come.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.435
- No, we have to stay.

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:36.504
- Linda, you're coming with me.

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.140
- I don't want to.

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.042
This is where I live.

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.880
This is our home we stay.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.882
- Okay, okay, Linda.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:47.883
Linda.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:52.654
Listen to me okay
they want to hurt us.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.457
- We can't go.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:01.898
- Linda, if you don't
come with me right now

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:06.068
you're never gonna
see me again ever.

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.672
Do you understand that?

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:23.085
- Stop it you need to
be a big girl now.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.657
- Where are you going?

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:32.261
- We just need to
leave for a few days.

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.630
Are you gonna bring her back?

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:36.565
- Why?

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.100
- I have to go, Neil.

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.428
- You know you're acting
awfully strange, Jenibel.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:46.075
- I just need to get out
of here for a while.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.213
You know you're just like dad.

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:53.214
You're a liar.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:58.054
You always think I'm
so goddamn stupid.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.624
- Look what you did?

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.462
- Don't you understand, Jenibel.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.664
I can't just let you leave.

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.599
- It's okay, honey.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.168
Just come with me.

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:15.470
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.972
You're not leaving.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.139
- Neil.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.174
Neil.

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:21.710
- Stop acting so crazy.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:23.411
Come on sit down.

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:24.713
Just sit down here.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:25.981
There you go.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.350
Stop struggling.

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.125
Stop struggling.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.338
Rose.

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:56.644
Rose.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.589
- Okay you guys seat belts on.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:08.691
- I'm scared.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:20.068
- Everything is
going to be fine.

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.069
It'll will be fun.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.070
- Please stop.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.819
- Jenibel.
- Hey stop.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:47.062
- Why are you doing this?

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.063
- Hey.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.067
Jenibel.

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:56.839
- Stop I don't wanna leave.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.642
You're not visiting.

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:04.813
Stop. - Linda.

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.517
- Go back.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.554
Stop.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.774
- Where's Linda?
- It's alright Jenibel.

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:08.810
You're gonna be okay.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:09.745
- Linda.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:11.912
- Where is she?
- Just calm down.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:13.814
- Tell me what happened to her.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.818
- It's gonna be fine just relax.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.353
- Linda's not with us.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.823
- No, no I don't believe you.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:22.924
- Jenny, she's gone.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:25.161
- You're lying.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:34.368
- Jenna stop.
- What are you doing?

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:35.636
What are you doing to me?

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.939
- Hold her for Christ's sake.

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:41.309
There you go.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.810
Just breathe.

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:46.613
Breathe deeply you're
gonna be fine.

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.184
You're gonna be all right.

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:51.853
You'll be surprised what
a little rest can do.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.721
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.496
- So sorry, Jenny.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.571
- Jenibel.

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.942
Jenibel, can you hear me?

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.544
You're unsound.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.581
Well, that's what they said.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.917
But I think you sound just fine.

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:28.923
- We're going to take
care of things here now.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:32.595
You don't have to do
anything ever again.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.964
Just get well.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.003
- I told you she was crazy.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:42.972
She killed the dog.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:02.257
- We don't have a choice.
- Yeah, but I can't just.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.025
- You already did, okay.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.294
Be a man.

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.730
- Shit.

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.417
- Oh, my god.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.052
I knew it.

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:31.420
I knew it wasn't true.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.857
- I'm really sorry.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.725
- I know you are.

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:38.861
You were just scared.

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.067
Linda, what are we gonna do?

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.077
Yeah, you're right.

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.077
- You made the right
decision Jenibel.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.680
This is your home our home.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.982
Nobody should ever
take that away.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:39.054
- I just needed to think
things through I guess.

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:52.834
- Well,

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.003
here we are.

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.490
Well, look at you.

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.394
See what a little
rest can do for you.

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:22.698
- It's hard to believe
what was happening to me.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:27.535
Well, what I thought
was happening to me.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:31.774
- Well, you aren't living in
your mother's time Jenibel.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:34.742
These things can be controlled

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:38.447
with medication and
proper diet and rest.

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:42.151
It's a quiet life up here, but

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.789
that may be exactly
what you need.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:53.861
- You know when I woke
up I actually believed

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.532
you were telling me
that Linda was dead.

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:12.181
- Jenibel you gotta
listen to me.

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:15.818
Linda died when you
were 13 years old.

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:24.759
She was stung by a bee

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.727
when you two were
playing by the hive

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:29.164
and she had an
allergic reaction.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:38.139
This was before your
mother did what she did?

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.208
You remember?

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.911
- Hi.

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.113
- Hey, Jewel.

01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:50.585
Things are gonna
be different now.

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.954
- What are you doing with that?

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.590
- Okay, do you have
your seat belt on?

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.259
- Stop acting so crazy.

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:09.605
- I forgive them.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:34.863
I'm afraid I'm still
not quite myself.

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.003
I am getting better though.

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:47.709
I can tell.

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.898
That's okay, Bert.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:13.268
You'll be surprised what
a little rest can do.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.644
- Can I show you something?

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.326
I'm glad you came back.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:46.994
It was time.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:04.379
- I couldn't have
done it without you.
