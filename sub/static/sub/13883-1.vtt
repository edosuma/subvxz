Three million years from Earth,
the mining ship Red Dwarf,

01:10.839 --> 01:14.276
Its crew; Dave Lister,
the last human being alive;

01:14.276 --> 01:17.352
Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
of his dead bunkmate;

01:17.352 --> 01:20.671
and a creature who evolved
from the ship's cat, Message ends,

01:23.280 --> 01:27.512
Additional, As the days go by,
we face the increasing inevitability

01:27.512 --> 01:30.717
that we are alone in a godless, uninhabited,

01:30.717 --> 01:32.950
hostile and meaningless universe,

01:32.950 --> 01:35.793
Still, you've got to laugh, haven 't you?

01:52.560 --> 01:56.872
(AUSTRALIAN WOMAN) Sit down, Brook,
There's something I must tell you,

01:56.872 --> 01:59.235
(AUSTRALIAN MAN) What is it, Kelly?

01:59.235 --> 02:04.110
I wasn 't with Simone, Brook,
I spent the night with Gary,

02:04.110 --> 02:07.954
You're ex-husband? My business rival?
What are you saying?!

02:07.954 --> 02:10.713
I'm saying, Brook Junior,,,

02:10.713 --> 02:13.109
What about Brook Junior?

02:13.109 --> 02:15.589
He isn 't your android,

02:17.480 --> 02:20.074
# Androids

02:53.474 --> 02:56.791
"I hope the weather will be clement. "

02:56.791 --> 02:59.838
I hope the weather will be clement,

03:00.680 --> 03:04.195
Lister, don't tell me! I could have got that!

03:08.000 --> 03:09.991
Ah! I remember this one.

03:09.991 --> 03:13.038
"Please direct me to a five-star hotel."

03:13.038 --> 03:17.352
Wrong, actually. Totally, utterly
and completely wrong.

03:17.352 --> 03:21.115
Please direct me to a five-star hotel,

03:21.640 --> 03:23.676
Lister, will you shut up?

03:23.676 --> 03:26.228
- I'm only helping.
- I don't need help.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.835
The meal was splendid,

03:39.835 --> 03:42.639
Congratulations to the chef,

03:42.639 --> 03:44.472
What? Pause.

03:44.472 --> 03:46.869
You've done Esperanto for eight years.

03:46.869 --> 03:49.315
How come you're so utterly useless?

03:49.315 --> 03:53.393
And how many books have you read in your life?

03:53.393 --> 03:56.517
The same as Champion the Wonder Horse - zero!

03:56.517 --> 03:59.672
- I've read books.
- I don't mean books

03:59.672 --> 04:02.320
about a dog called Ben.

04:02.320 --> 04:07.713
- I went to art college!
- How did YOU get into art college?

04:07.713 --> 04:13.830
The usual, boring way you get in.
I failed me exams and applied.

04:13.830 --> 04:17.959
- They snapped me up.
- You didn't get a degree...did you?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.713
- No. I wasn't there long.
- How long?

04:20.713 --> 04:24.634
Ninety-seven minutes.
I thought it'd be a good skive.

04:24.634 --> 04:28.429
I took one look at the timetable and checked out.

04:28.429 --> 04:32.911
It was ridiculous. They had lectures,
like, first thing in the afternoon!

04:32.911 --> 04:35.355
We're talking 12.30 every day!

04:35.355 --> 04:38.830
Who's together then?
You can still taste the toothpaste.

04:38.830 --> 04:41.639
Well, unlike you, Lister, I have ambitions!

04:41.639 --> 04:45.030
I'm not prepared to sit around
polishing my spacebike,

04:45.030 --> 04:49.238
so I can go joy-riding, because I'm not a gimp!

04:49.238 --> 04:53.711
One of my ambitions
is to learn another language. Play.

05:07.951 --> 05:09.837
(SPEAKS ESPERANTO)

05:14.280 --> 05:16.953
And I think we know what that means.

05:16.953 --> 05:21.591
Yeah, it means, "Get the hall porter,
There's a frog in my bidet, "

05:21.591 --> 05:24.956
Well, what's "Your father was a baboon's rump,

05:24.956 --> 05:28.828
"and your mother was always at it with sailors"?

05:28.828 --> 05:32.515
- I'm not telling you,
- It's because you're bored, isn't it?

05:32.515 --> 05:36.513
- That's why you're both annoying me.
- I'm not bored,

05:36.513 --> 05:39.353
I've devised a system to revolutionise music,

05:39.353 --> 05:42.318
- Get outta town!
- Yeah, I've decimalised it,

05:42.318 --> 05:45.278
Instead of the octave, it's the decadive,

05:45.278 --> 05:48.272
I've invented two new notes, H and J,

05:48.272 --> 05:50.954
You can't just i nvent new notes.

05:50.954 --> 05:52.837
Well, I have,

05:52.837 --> 05:58.040
Now it goes,,,
# Doh, ray, me, fah, soh, lah, woh, boh, tee, doh

# Doh, tee, boh, woh,
lah, soh, fah, me, ray, doh #

- What are you drivelli ng about?
- "Hol Rock, " It'll be whole new sound,

All the instruments will be bigger,
Triangles will have four sides,

06:13.833 --> 06:17.913
Piano keyboards the length of zebra crossings,

06:17.913 --> 06:21.515
Women will have to be banned
from playing the cello,

06:21.515 --> 06:26.628
- Holly...shut up!
- Oh, I haven 't told you the news,

06:26.628 --> 06:29.757
- What news?
- A signal, We're getting a signal,

06:29.757 --> 06:31.831
I just thought I'd mention it,

06:32.720 --> 06:35.678
- Aliens.
- Oh, God. "Aliens"!

06:35.678 --> 06:38.752
Your explanation for anything
slightly peculiar is aliens.

06:38.752 --> 06:41.070
You lose your keys - it's aliens.

06:41.070 --> 06:43.549
A picture falls down - it's aliens.

06:43.549 --> 06:47.872
That day we used up a whole bog roll - aliens.

06:47.872 --> 06:51.316
We didn't use it all, Lister. Who did?

06:51.316 --> 06:54.631
Rimmer, aliens used our bog roll?!

06:56.160 --> 07:01.234
Being aliens doesn't mean
they don't have to visit the little boys' room.

07:01.234 --> 07:03.754
Although they probably do something weird,

07:03.754 --> 07:06.912
Iike it comes out of their heads.

07:06.912 --> 07:11.676
Well, I wouldn't like to be stuck
behind one in a cinema!

07:12.000 --> 07:14.150
Here, mousey, mousey!

I got some cheese!

- Yo, Cat!
- Huh?

07:22.511 --> 07:25.239
We're getting a signal. Come on.

07:25.239 --> 07:27.117
Aliens!

07:31.680 --> 07:35.275
It's a distress call from a ship
called the Nova 5, They've crash landed,

07:35.275 --> 07:38.318
- I'm trying to establish contact,
- Another ship? Brilliant!

07:38.318 --> 07:40.994
- It's not aliens?
- No, they're from Earth,

07:40.994 --> 07:45.153
I hope they've got some spare stuff,
We're short on a few supplies,

07:45.153 --> 07:47.515
- Like what?
- Cow's milk,

07:47.515 --> 07:51.354
Ran out of that yonks ago, Fresh and dehydrated,

07:51.354 --> 07:56.116
- What ki nd are we usi ng now?
- Emergency supply, Dog's milk,

08:00.760 --> 08:03.274
- Dog's milk?!
- Nothing wrong with dog's milk,

08:03.274 --> 08:07.194
Full of goodness, full of vitamins,,,
full of marrowbone jelly,

08:08.680 --> 08:11.148
Lasts longer than any other type of milk,

08:11.148 --> 08:14.038
- Why?
- No bugger'll drink it,

08:17.720 --> 08:23.078
Plus, when it goes off, it tastes
the same as when it's fresh,

08:25.400 --> 08:27.960
Why didn't you tell me, Holly?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.190
What? And spoil your tea?

08:30.190 --> 08:33.909
- Hang about, We've got contact,
- Punch it up.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.796
Thank goodness! My name's Kryten,

08:36.796 --> 08:40.554
I'm the Nova 5 service mechanoid,

08:40.554 --> 08:42.835

08:42.835 --> 08:46.196
The female officers are injured,
but stable, Please help,

08:46.196 --> 08:48.999
Is that female as i n soft and squidgy?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.951

- Three,

08:51.951 --> 08:56.716
Miss Jane, Miss Tracy and Miss Anne,
I'm transmitting medical details,

09:01.440 --> 09:05.752
Tell them we're coming aboard!
We'll rescue these fair blooms,

09:05.752 --> 09:09.674
or my name's not Captain A J Rimmer,
Space Adventurer!

09:09.674 --> 09:12.797
- Thank you, Captain,
- "Space Adventurer"?!

09:12.797 --> 09:18.079
What do I say? "Fear not, I'm the guy
who cleans the chicken soup machine!

09:18.079 --> 09:20.833
"We know sod all about space travel,

09:20.833 --> 09:24.469
"but if you've got a blocked nozzle,
we're your lads!"

09:24.469 --> 09:27.552
- That'll fill them with confidence.
- How far away?

09:27.552 --> 09:30.757
- About 24 hours,
- What? Only 24 hours?

09:30.757 --> 09:32.956
I'd better start gettin' ready!

09:32.956 --> 09:37.511
# Twenty four hours... #
Aow! First in the shower room!

09:38.640 --> 09:41.916
I'm so excited, all six of my nipples are tinglin'!

09:43.120 --> 09:46.874
What's wrong with him?
We're on a mission of mercy!

09:46.874 --> 09:51.636
We're taking them urgent medical supplies.
We're not on the pull.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.030
Yo!

11:05.360 --> 11:10.673
No, not on the pull, are we, Lister?
Look at you. Absolutely pathetic!

11:10.673 --> 11:13.752
You're wearing all your least smeggy things.

11:13.752 --> 11:16.195
I don't know what you mean.

11:16.195 --> 11:19.590
That T-shirt with only two curry stains,

11:19.590 --> 11:22.035
you only wear on special occasions.

11:22.035 --> 11:25.430
You're toffed up to the nines, laddie!

11:25.430 --> 11:29.229
What about you? You look like Clive of India,

11:29.229 --> 11:32.710
or the one whose mum uses new biological Biz!

11:32.710 --> 11:35.394
Oh, it's started! I knew it would!

11:35.394 --> 11:37.471
- What has?
- The put-downs.

11:37.471 --> 11:41.758
It's always the same.
Put me down, so you look good.

11:41.758 --> 11:44.115
- Like when?
- Those brunettes from Supplies.

11:44.115 --> 11:48.830
I said I worked in Stores,
and they asked what I did.

11:48.830 --> 11:51.992
- And I said you were a shelf!
- Exactly.

11:51.992 --> 11:54.719
I suggested a trip to Titan Zoo,

11:54.719 --> 11:58.952
and you said, "He's taking you
to meet his mum already!"

11:58.952 --> 12:02.112
- So? They laughed.
- At me. At my expense.

12:02.112 --> 12:07.399
- Just don't put me down.
- OK. What do you want me to say?

12:07.399 --> 12:12.110
- For a start, don't call me Rimmer.
- Why not?

12:12.110 --> 12:17.115
You always put the emphasis on "Rim".
Makes me sound like a disinfectant.

12:17.115 --> 12:19.794
What should I call you? Rimere?

12:19.794 --> 12:23.589
I don't know... "Arnie", "Arn".

12:23.589 --> 12:28.310
Something with a bit more...
I don't know... How about "Big Man"?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.551
"Big Man"?

12:32.551 --> 12:35.473
- Or my nickname at school?
- "Bonehead"?

12:37.080 --> 12:40.868
- How did you know that?
- I was only guessing.

12:40.868 --> 12:43.633
- I meant the other one.
- What other one?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.113
"Ace".

12:46.113 --> 12:51.832
Get outta town! Your nickname was never "Ace".
Maybe "Acehole".

12:53.440 --> 12:56.432
It WAS my nickname at school, actually.

12:56.432 --> 12:59.796
It's just no one ever called me it.

12:59.796 --> 13:02.110
What are you saying, Rimmer?

13:02.110 --> 13:06.318
I'm saying build me up, don't put me down.

13:06.318 --> 13:10.552
Like...if the opportunity occurs,
and it crops up in conversation,

13:10.552 --> 13:13.757
you could perhaps mention that I'm very brave.

13:13.757 --> 13:16.070
- Do what?!
- Don't go ape.

13:16.070 --> 13:19.436
Just sort of mention, perhaps, that...I died,

13:19.436 --> 13:22.956
and that I was pretty incredibly brave about it.

13:22.956 --> 13:27.113
Perhaps you could mention
that I've had tons of girlfriends?

13:29.120 --> 13:33.716
Oh, forget it! It was just an idea.
You're not wearing those boots?

13:33.716 --> 13:37.110
- What's wrong with them?
- Oh, they just don't go.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.510
You should wear
your Day-Glo orange moon boots.

13:40.510 --> 13:43.592
- You said they were disgusting.
- No, very chic.

13:44.440 --> 13:48.638
You said they smelled
like an orang-utan's posing pouch.

13:48.638 --> 13:54.158
They set off one of the chemical alarms.
You put them in the airlock.

13:54.158 --> 13:57.038
No, they look terrific. I'd wear them.

13:57.038 --> 13:59.350
- Honest?
- Definitely.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.628
Come along, everybody!

14:11.680 --> 14:13.910
They're here. They're in orbit!

14:16.320 --> 14:18.754
(GASPS) Miss Jane!

14:21.120 --> 14:23.111
What about your hair?

14:23.111 --> 14:25.350
What a mess you look.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.511
Now, smart but casual.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.555
Miss Anne, why, you haven't touched your soup.

14:40.555 --> 14:44.155
No wonder you're beginning to look so pasty.

14:44.155 --> 14:46.231
Oh, no!

14:46.231 --> 14:48.914
Do eat nicely, Miss Anne!

14:48.914 --> 14:53.949
What will the visitors think
if they see you eating like that?

14:55.680 --> 14:57.432
Miss Tracey...

14:58.160 --> 15:01.869
No... You look absolutely perfect.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.749
- What's that smell?
- I can't smell anything.

15:12.749 --> 15:15.035
Your eyes are watering.

15:15.035 --> 15:19.113
It's the excitement.
We can't wait for Cat. Let's just go.

15:19.113 --> 15:22.317
Come on. He's been preparing for a day.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.155
Aow! Wait for me!

15:36.160 --> 15:39.948
Hi, monkeys! It's me,
the plastic surgeon's nightmare!

15:39.948 --> 15:44.591
- A spacesuit with cufflinks?!
- Where'd you get the helmet?

15:44.591 --> 15:47.592
I made it. I didn't want to mess up my hair.

15:47.960 --> 15:54.752
Hey, listen - don't pass any mirrors,
'cause if we do, I'm there for the day!

15:54.752 --> 15:57.274
(SNIFFS) Phew! What's that smell?

15:57.274 --> 15:59.954
All right? Everybody ready? Let's go,

15:59.954 --> 16:04.192
- What are you doing?
- What? What's wrong?

16:04.192 --> 16:08.068
- Why are you wearing a toupee?
- What toupee?

16:08.440 --> 16:10.954
- The one on your head.
- Whose head?

16:10.954 --> 16:15.113
- You look like a game show host.
- What's wrong with everyone?

16:15.113 --> 16:19.159
Three million years without women
and you're like 14-year-olds!

16:19.159 --> 16:22.437
- What about you and the socks?
- What socks?

16:22.437 --> 16:25.751
- Come on!
- He's wearing two pairs of socks,

16:25.751 --> 16:28.274
- Why?
- One pair on his feet,

16:28.274 --> 16:30.476
the other down his trousers,

16:49.520 --> 16:53.195
Come in, come in. How lovely to meet you.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.396
Charmita! And what a delightful craft you have.

16:57.396 --> 17:01.189
- Reminds me of my first command.
- This way, please.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.632
(WHISPERS) Ace.

17:12.720 --> 17:16.473
- Hey, you're a work of art, baby!
- (LISTER) Psst!

17:17.839 --> 17:20.479
You're gonna have to help me, man!

17:23.160 --> 17:24.752
Thank you!

17:25.319 --> 17:27.628
I'm so excited! We all are.

17:27.628 --> 17:31.156
The girls could hardly stop jumping up and down!

17:31.156 --> 17:32.798
Ah! Charmita, charmita!

17:32.798 --> 17:35.633
Ah! Vi parolas Esperanto, Kapitano Rimmer?

17:35.633 --> 17:39.395
- Come again?
- You speak Esperanto?

17:39.395 --> 17:42.438
Oh! Si, si, si! Jahwohl! Oui!

17:46.200 --> 17:48.509
Well, here they are.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.231
Charmita!

17:59.640 --> 18:03.030
Well... It's difficult to know what to say...

18:03.030 --> 18:05.111
isn't it, Ace?

18:05.111 --> 18:08.795
Isn't anybody going to say hello?

18:09.680 --> 18:12.911
I think the blonde one's giving you the eye.

18:12.911 --> 18:16.231
Well, I'll leave you to get acquainted.

18:16.231 --> 18:19.630
I'll just go and fix some tea.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.355
- Hi, baby!
- I don't believe this.

18:23.355 --> 18:25.431
Be strong, Big Man.

18:25.431 --> 18:28.990
Our first contact in three million and two years,

18:28.990 --> 18:31.230
and it's the android Norman Bates.

18:31.230 --> 18:34.949
Come on! So, they're a little skinny!

18:34.949 --> 18:39.192
Listen, girls. I don't know
whether this is the time,

18:39.192 --> 18:41.919
but my mate Ace is incredibly brave.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.871
Smeg off, dogfood face.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.910
- And he's got tons of girlfriends!
- I'm warning you, Lister.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.431
Is anything the matter?

19:06.680 --> 19:09.513
Anything the matter? They're dead!

19:09.513 --> 19:11.955
Who's dead?

19:11.955 --> 19:14.793
THEY are dead! They're all dead!

19:16.520 --> 19:18.112
My God!

19:19.120 --> 19:22.078
I was only away two minutes!

19:25.520 --> 19:28.080
They've been dead for centuries!

19:28.920 --> 19:30.399
- No.
- Yes!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.911
Are you a doctor?

19:34.920 --> 19:39.630
Look at them! They've got less meat
on them than a Chicken Nuggett!

19:43.160 --> 19:47.358
What am I going to do?
I'm programmed to serve them.

19:47.358 --> 19:53.072
- I think we should bury them.
- You're that sure they're dead?

19:53.072 --> 19:56.550
- Yes!
- What about this one?

19:56.550 --> 19:58.949
Er, there's a simple test.

19:58.949 --> 20:03.477
All right, girls, hands up
those of you who are alive.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.079
What am I going to do?

20:16.960 --> 20:21.795
I can't leave them!
Mr David, please, please, take me back!

20:21.795 --> 20:24.440
You've got to start a new life.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.956
I haven't got the software to cope with this.

20:27.956 --> 20:31.635
I was created to serve. I serve, therefore I am.

20:31.635 --> 20:34.951
It's my purpose to serve
without regard for myself.

20:34.951 --> 20:39.113
- You sound like my mum.
- It's all I know.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.317
You've got to change. Do what you want.

20:42.317 --> 20:44.391
Stop being everyone's smeggin' doormat.

20:44.391 --> 20:47.552
That's easy for you to say, you're human.

20:47.552 --> 20:49.631
Only just.

20:52.920 --> 20:57.357
Ah, Kryten! Nothing to do, eh? Follow me.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.835
What the smeggin' hell is going on?

21:48.835 --> 21:51.992
- Good afternoon, Mr David, sir.
- What are these?

21:51.992 --> 21:57.677
- Your boxer shorts, Mr David, sir.
- No way are these mine. These bend!

21:59.960 --> 22:03.999
- What have you done?
- I've done a spot of tidying up.

22:03.999 --> 22:09.837
Where is everything?
Where's me coffee cup with the mould in it?

22:09.837 --> 22:13.674
- I threw it away, sir.
- I was breeding that mould!

22:13.674 --> 22:18.834
His name was Albert! I was trying
to get him two foot high!

22:18.834 --> 22:22.310
- Why, sir?
- Because it drives Rimmer nuts.

22:22.310 --> 22:25.392
Driving Rimmer nuts is what keeps me going.

22:25.392 --> 22:28.916
- I'm sorry, Mr David, sir.
- Look at you.

22:28.916 --> 22:32.879
- Why are you doing this?
- Serving makes me happy, sir.

22:32.879 --> 22:36.032
But don't you want to do anything for yourself?

22:36.032 --> 22:41.990
Myself? That's a barmy notion,
if you don't mind my saying so, sir!

22:41.990 --> 22:44.913
There must be something you look forward to.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.957
Androids.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.357
# Androids

22:52.560 --> 22:55.597
# Everybody needs good androids... #

22:57.840 --> 23:03.233
- That stupid soap opera? Why?
- Because I can forget I'm me.

23:03.233 --> 23:06.118
Androids. What else?

23:06.118 --> 23:09.590
- Being asleep.
- Androids and being asleep?

23:09.590 --> 23:14.993
Sounds like a crazy, fun-packed life
you lead there, Kryten, me old son!

23:14.993 --> 23:17.913
I have strange thoughts when I'm asleep.

23:17.913 --> 23:22.915
- Yeah, they're called dreams.
- My favourite is about a garden.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.874
I've never even seen a garden, except in books.

23:27.874 --> 23:31.635
And I've planted everything and made it grow.

23:31.635 --> 23:35.599
It's my garden,
and there's no one there but me,

23:35.599 --> 23:38.513
just me and all the things I made live.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.397
Silly.

23:41.397 --> 23:45.314
No, it isn't. Find a planet and do it.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.753
I can't. I'm programmed to serve.

23:48.753 --> 23:51.957
But there's no one to serve now, Kryten.

23:51.957 --> 23:56.750
What about Mr Arnold?
I've got to complete Mr Arnold's tasks.

23:56.750 --> 24:01.231
You what?! Rimmer gave you all this?

24:01.231 --> 24:04.039
Well, Mr Arnold is my master now.

24:04.039 --> 24:07.351
"Mr Arnold" isn't his name.
His name's "Rimmer"...

24:07.351 --> 24:09.431
or "Smeghead"...

24:09.431 --> 24:12.717
or "Dinosaur Breath", or "Molecule Mind".

24:12.717 --> 24:19.399
And on a very rare occasion, when you
wanna be really mega-polite to him,

24:19.399 --> 24:22.199
you can call him "Arsehole".

24:43.080 --> 24:45.116
(CAT) Yeah, yeah, yeah!

24:50.360 --> 24:55.229
I think it'll be best on that wall,
sort of dominating the room.

24:55.229 --> 24:58.437
- Yes, Mr Arnold, sir.
- "Yes Mr Arnold, sir!"

24:58.437 --> 25:01.717
- You're a total gwenlin, Kryten.
- Yes, Mr David, sir.

25:01.717 --> 25:05.076
- "Yes Mr David, sir!"
- Leave it alone, Lister.

25:05.076 --> 25:09.233
- It enjoys the tasks I give it.
- Drop dead, Rimmer.

25:09.233 --> 25:11.436
- Already have done.
- Encore.

25:11.436 --> 25:16.799
A cat would never be a servant.
Ever see a cat return a stick?

25:16.799 --> 25:22.079
"Hey, man, you threw the stick,
you go get it yourself. I'm busy!

25:22.079 --> 25:26.358
"If you wanted the stick,
why'd you throw it away?"

25:26.358 --> 25:29.238
Kryten, you got nothing from those movies.

25:29.238 --> 25:33.552
- What movies?
- Mr David showed me the Wild Ones,

25:33.552 --> 25:36.677
Easy Rider and Rebel Without A Cause.

25:36.677 --> 25:40.275
I thought it might do him good. Fat chance.

25:40.275 --> 25:42.351
During Marlon Brando's rebel speech,

25:42.351 --> 25:46.353
he gets a brush-a-matic and does my lapels!

25:46.353 --> 25:50.877
Well, now maybe you'll learn, Lister.
There's a natural order to things.

25:50.877 --> 25:52.951
Some give orders, others obey.

25:52.951 --> 25:57.397
That's how it's always been,
that's how it'll always be. Eh, Kryten?

25:57.397 --> 26:01.075
- Oh, yes, Mr Arnold, sir.
- Oh, what's the point?

26:01.075 --> 26:06.393
- Well, I've finished, Mr Arnold, sir.
- Excellent, Kryten!

26:13.400 --> 26:16.153
I think it's rather good. Don't you?

26:16.153 --> 26:22.429
- WHAT are you doing?
- I, erm... I think I'm, er...

26:22.429 --> 26:24.590
I'm rebelling.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.393
- Rebelling?
- I, er...sort of...

26:28.393 --> 26:31.870
I think that's what I'm doing.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.511
You...are rebelling?

26:34.800 --> 26:36.199
Yes.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.076
What are you rebelling against?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.356
(AS MARLON BRANDO) Whaddya got?

26:51.200 --> 26:53.191
Dinosaur breath!

26:54.640 --> 26:56.915
Molecule mind!

27:03.600 --> 27:05.716
Smeg-for-brains!

27:07.240 --> 27:10.596
- I need your bike!
- You got it!

27:12.000 --> 27:13.991
Swivel on it, punk!

27:26.200 --> 27:27.997
# It's cold outside

27:27.997 --> 27:29.877
# There's no kind of atmosphere

27:29.877 --> 27:33.316
# I'm all alone, more or less

27:33.316 --> 27:36.517
# Let me fly far away from here

27:36.517 --> 27:39.353
# Fun, fun, fun

27:39.353 --> 27:42.955
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:42.955 --> 27:46.396
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

27:46.396 --> 27:49.756
# Drinking fresh mango juice

27:49.756 --> 27:53.116
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

27:53.116 --> 27:55.873
# Fun, fun, fun

27:55.873 --> 27:59.635
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:59.635 --> 28:02.393
# Fun, fun, fun

28:02.393 --> 28:06.553
# In the sun, sun, sun #

28:07.305 --> 28:13.412
