<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.362 --> 00:10.965
<i>Everyone is overjoyed
when a visitor comes to town.</i>

00:11.057 --> 00:12.429
Oh, not him...

00:12.546 --> 00:14.736
Dyson!
What a wonderful surprise!

00:14.860 --> 00:17.342
<i>Tron remembers Dyson fondly.</i>

00:17.452 --> 00:20.165
- Thanks.
- Anytime, old friend.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.357
- Now!
- Flynn, go!

00:22.452 --> 00:25.266
Dyson... I trusted you!

00:25.461 --> 00:29.364
<i>And Beck realizes Tron
is interested in more than reunion.</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:32.174
I'm not letting you kill for revenge.

00:32.609 --> 00:34.996
I didn't ask your permission.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.003
Where're you going, Tron?

01:39.057 --> 01:42.074
Come on, Tron. This isn't you!

02:18.320 --> 02:20.069
Enough!

02:21.595 --> 02:23.960
Enough!

02:26.019 --> 02:35.519
<b>S01E10 - Scars, Part 2</b>

03:10.050 --> 03:12.026
Whoa.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.712
You had simple orders.

03:26.877 --> 03:31.250
Give Dyson a tour.
Make sure it goes smoothly.

03:31.648 --> 03:33.026
So why didn't it?!

03:33.193 --> 03:37.080
There was a minor security lapse,
but Dyson was unharmed.

03:37.202 --> 03:40.879
Fortunately, I was there to stop
the Renegade from claiming his target.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.076
If I hear one more mention of him...

03:43.168 --> 03:46.459
Mention... of whom?

03:51.339 --> 03:53.654
Oh, no one important.

03:53.981 --> 03:58.599
Dyson. So glad to see
you're treating my ship...

03:58.855 --> 04:00.620
as your ship.

04:01.186 --> 04:04.787
Is there a problem, Tesler?

04:04.991 --> 04:07.443
Not at all.
Why would you say that?

04:07.699 --> 04:12.104
Because I sense surprising
lack of control over the city.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.852
It might be necessary
for me to stick around a while longer.

04:16.226 --> 04:18.253
Maybe indefinitely.

04:18.464 --> 04:23.001
Besides, I'm looking forward
to meeting this... Renegade,

04:23.305 --> 04:27.642
but we'll never catch him if we're
always sitting around on the job,

04:27.794 --> 04:30.095
will we?

04:31.009 --> 04:34.480
Doesn't this tour come with guides?

04:36.422 --> 04:40.161
I'll handle it.
There won't be any more trouble.

04:48.430 --> 04:51.915
So, how long is Tesler
going to keep on pretending

04:51.916 --> 04:54.239
he can handle this Renegade? Hm?

04:54.489 --> 04:56.662
- Permission to speak candidly?
- Hm.

04:57.004 --> 04:59.664
He's shiftier
than we gave him credit for,

04:59.801 --> 05:02.234
but hardly a threat.

05:05.811 --> 05:08.367
"Hardly a threat".

05:08.657 --> 05:12.567
You'll forgive me if I
no longer trust your word in that.

05:13.034 --> 05:15.678
I'll be right back.

05:15.919 --> 05:20.988
<i>Warning: Cooling failure.
Overload imminent.</i>

05:52.129 --> 05:53.862
Reeve?

05:54.278 --> 05:55.792
Reeve?!

05:56.053 --> 05:58.874
Hang tight until I can figure
a way out of here!

05:59.076 --> 06:01.475
<i>Executing "repurposing" protocol.</i>

06:01.708 --> 06:03.978
<i>Standby for code extraction.</i>

06:04.082 --> 06:05.756
Reeve!

06:13.809 --> 06:15.661
No!

06:31.548 --> 06:32.965
Dyson.

06:33.607 --> 06:36.451
What have you done?

06:53.922 --> 06:55.387
Hello...

06:56.903 --> 06:59.426
...old friend.

07:04.832 --> 07:07.004
You've found me.

07:07.570 --> 07:12.224
- I guess I should congratulate you.
- I was trained by the best.

07:15.114 --> 07:18.065
You being here doesn't change anything.

07:18.331 --> 07:20.884
I'm still gonna finish what I came to do.

07:21.117 --> 07:23.623
And I'll still stop you.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.634
Come with me. We can
get Dyson's disc the right way.

07:27.863 --> 07:30.362
<i>Without derezzing him.</i>

07:32.894 --> 07:34.930
Please.

07:51.511 --> 07:53.056
My disc!

07:53.372 --> 07:56.166
The cuffs work on a timer.

07:56.350 --> 08:00.431
By the time they unlock,
Dyson will be dead.

08:04.802 --> 08:06.092
Tron!

08:06.914 --> 08:11.902
Don't end the revolution
before it has a chance to start.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.391
<i>Danger: Pressure level critical.</i>

08:19.556 --> 08:22.427
<i>Prepare to evacuate.</i>

08:23.989 --> 08:27.539
<i>Danger. Please evacuate...</i>

08:28.894 --> 08:33.053
- That really hurt!
- Trying to cause an overload?

08:33.268 --> 08:36.205
No... I found them like this...

08:36.313 --> 08:39.866
- It must've been the Renegade.
- Don't insult me.

08:40.038 --> 08:43.700
You're trying to undermine Tesler
since the moment Dyson landed.

08:43.883 --> 08:47.310
- Lies.
- I have proof on my disc!

08:47.507 --> 08:49.227
How about I show Tesler?

08:49.325 --> 08:52.135
How fast do you think
he'd throw you into the games?

08:52.296 --> 08:54.679
Wait! Isn't it obvious?

08:54.890 --> 08:57.218
Tesler's on his way out.
And when he goes down,

08:57.318 --> 09:00.011
his most loyal soldiers
are taking the plunge with him.

09:00.156 --> 09:04.270
But it doesn't have to be that way!
Not for us!

09:04.756 --> 09:08.531
You really wanna form
a secret alliance with me?

09:09.972 --> 09:13.036
- Maybe...
- It is amazing,

09:13.137 --> 09:16.951
how you keep finding
new ways to disgust me.

09:17.555 --> 09:20.462
Oh... and no.

09:39.643 --> 09:44.270
Renegade. I know you're here.

09:44.595 --> 09:46.730
Why don't you come out?

09:48.228 --> 09:51.233
You see me. I'm not hiding.

09:54.461 --> 09:59.065
So you tricked a meagre few
into thinking you're Tron.

10:04.081 --> 10:07.541
We both know that's a lie.

10:10.612 --> 10:15.908
You're just playing dress up,
wearing a dead program's...

10:16.167 --> 10:18.392
emblem!

10:21.060 --> 10:24.311
<i>Please proceed to nearest exit.</i>

11:07.986 --> 11:11.582
Everyone else screams.
Why doesn't he?

11:12.561 --> 11:17.456
- He's Tron.
- Tron...

11:25.084 --> 11:27.929
You haven't said a word.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.784
I'm starting to think
you don't like me anymore.

11:31.042 --> 11:33.528
- What have you done to them?
- Who?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.953
Oh... our team.

11:36.134 --> 11:39.489
That's just Clu's latest project.

11:39.705 --> 11:43.454
He calls it... repurposing.

11:43.847 --> 11:47.117
- How many have you repurposed?
- Under your command?

11:47.273 --> 11:48.735
Everyone.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.681
You are Flynn's last soldier,

11:51.818 --> 11:53.782
old friend.

11:57.158 --> 11:59.970
If I'm next,
then get it over with already.

12:00.144 --> 12:05.491
No. Repurposing is cruel,
leaves little of the personality intact.

12:05.799 --> 12:08.644
I'd rather you join Clu willingly.

12:08.754 --> 12:10.816
- Never...
- Are you blind?

12:10.954 --> 12:14.198
By overthrowing Flynn,
Clu will bring order to the Grid!

12:14.332 --> 12:17.759
Only through perfection can
all programs be truly liberated!

12:17.882 --> 12:20.049
You're delusional, Dyson.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.002
Clu didn't improve your face,

12:23.211 --> 12:26.466
he made you harder to look at!

12:27.236 --> 12:31.358
I didn't wanna do this...
but you forced my hand.

12:31.689 --> 12:34.925
I am going to show you
what it's like...

12:34.926 --> 12:38.161
to be imperfect.

12:48.154 --> 12:50.858
Take him to the throne ship.

12:56.363 --> 12:57.735
Oh God...

13:11.863 --> 13:15.034
<i>Rejoice, my soldiers.</i>

13:15.159 --> 13:21.210
<i>You have been repurposed
into a supreme party.</i>

13:21.890 --> 13:28.257
<i>Together we'll cleanse
the Grid from imperfection!</i>

13:28.379 --> 13:35.235
<i>Together we will bring down
the agents of terror!</i>

13:40.383 --> 13:41.995
No!

13:48.275 --> 13:52.315
Goodbye, old friend.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.578
Show yourself, Renegade.

14:52.771 --> 14:55.863
I'd like to see you before you're cubes.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.810
Come on, Renegade!

15:06.391 --> 15:08.900
Tron wouldn't have given up this easily.

16:14.375 --> 16:15.529
No!

16:16.231 --> 16:18.462
No, it's not possible!

16:18.842 --> 16:21.196
I watched you die!

16:21.435 --> 16:23.794
You watched me die.

16:24.060 --> 16:27.035
I'll watch you die!

16:34.390 --> 16:38.730
You may have escaped.
But it's not much of a life, is it, Tron?

16:40.206 --> 16:41.529
Let me guess...

16:41.629 --> 16:46.000
you live in a cave,
feeding from your own energy source.

16:46.446 --> 16:49.670
Normal programs
just get tired without energy,

16:49.821 --> 16:53.179
but not you,
you'll die without it!

16:53.466 --> 16:55.006
That was my gift.

16:55.137 --> 16:58.306
A modification
I added to your code,

16:58.475 --> 17:01.977
as a safeguard. I can fix you!

17:02.156 --> 17:05.984
Make you perfect, again.
If... you'll join us...

17:06.105 --> 17:07.665
join Clu!

17:07.981 --> 17:12.127
I'd rather stay like this for ever
than be a puppet of a tyrant!

17:27.039 --> 17:29.347
No! Tron.

17:53.215 --> 17:56.743
- Who are you?
- My name is Cyrus.

17:57.090 --> 18:00.910
- I'm a friend.
- You... you work for Dyson!

18:01.099 --> 18:02.454
For Clu!

18:02.649 --> 18:05.386
Not anymore. Now, jump!

18:23.936 --> 18:27.856
Hey, stay with me. That's it.

18:28.153 --> 18:30.307
You're gonna be alright.

18:30.532 --> 18:34.343
You did this... Why?

18:35.500 --> 18:40.818
I can't let your revolution end
before it has a chance to start.

18:53.843 --> 18:56.597
You're only alive for one reason.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.719
To deliver a message.

19:20.111 --> 19:22.814
Sir, I've lost track of Dyson.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.409
I take full responsibility.

19:25.839 --> 19:28.788
It's a shame she let you down,
your excellency.

19:29.024 --> 19:34.047
What are you talking about?
Paige, you've outdone yourself!

19:34.358 --> 19:37.344
Wait. Did Dyson leave Argon?

19:37.576 --> 19:40.219
Long gone, quaking in fear.

19:40.386 --> 19:43.899
I should have you two
work together more often.

20:10.389 --> 20:13.641
It was never about getting
Dyson's disc, was it?

20:14.410 --> 20:15.725
No.

20:16.713 --> 20:20.037
We both know what I was looking for,

20:20.824 --> 20:23.240
but you helped me find my way.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.311
I owe you thanks,

20:26.312 --> 20:29.149
and an apology.

20:29.515 --> 20:33.147
So...
does that mean I get time off?

20:33.596 --> 20:35.728
What do you think?

20:59.256 --> 21:04.145
I've just returned from Argon,
with a message from an old friend.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.920
I saw him with my own eyes.

21:08.273 --> 21:10.702
Tron lives.

21:13.535 --> 21:15.670
Interesting.

21:15.863 --> 21:19.454
Who else... knows about this?

21:26.921 --> 21:29.069
Nobody.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.217
Only us.

21:32.254 --> 21:35.245
Good. Let's keep it that way.
