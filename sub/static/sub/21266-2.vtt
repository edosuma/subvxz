"Ruthless" started out the gate winnin'.

01:25.683 --> 01:27.973
You know,
"Boyz-n-the-Hood" became a hit,

01:27.974 --> 01:30.349
so, we had to follow it up.

01:30.350 --> 01:31.890
But we needed more writers,

01:31.891 --> 01:35.098
so we call in a friend of
mine from Dallas, The D.O.C.

01:35.099 --> 01:36.349
And Eazy brought Ren in.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.307
How was that? Too slow?

01:38.308 --> 01:41.098

01:48.600 --> 01:49.724
My relationship with E,

01:49.725 --> 01:52.015
first startin' out, man, it was like...

01:52.016 --> 01:53.432
like you can say, like a little brother.

01:53.433 --> 01:55.390
'Cause he grew up
right around the corner from me.

01:55.391 --> 01:56.724

But when E did "Boyz-n-the-Hood,"

02:10.725 --> 02:11.890
it was like a shock to me,

02:11.891 --> 02:13.057
because I'm in the neighborhood.

02:13.058 --> 02:14.807
I'm tryin' to be an MC.

02:14.808 --> 02:16.557
Then, out the blue, I hear, like,

02:16.558 --> 02:17.599
"Man, who is... that's E?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.890
You know, that's him doin' that?"

02:36.933 --> 02:40.349
So, Dre had to teach him word by word,

02:53.808 --> 02:55.349

sit there, and just...

02:58.308 --> 03:00.599

03:07.974 --> 03:09.516
But Eric had such a...

03:09.517 --> 03:11.057
- unique voice.
- Shit!

03:11.058 --> 03:15.548
Man, to see Dre turn
this dude into a megastar...

03:15.573 --> 03:16.852
Yo, yo, yo.

03:16.877 --> 03:18.973
...it's like seeing
Dr. Frankenstein work,

03:18.974 --> 03:20.724
or some fuckin' wizard or something.

03:20.725 --> 03:22.307
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

03:22.308 --> 03:24.224
Who does it? Eazy does it.

03:24.225 --> 03:26.682
But how does he do it?

03:26.683 --> 03:28.807
- Longer. It gotta be longer.
- That was perfect right there.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.682
- That was right.
- Yeah. That wasn't long enough.

03:30.707 --> 03:32.450
- That was right!
- Got to have it a little bit longer.

03:32.475 --> 03:34.182
Nah, that was perfect, just like that.

03:38.016 --> 03:40.015
I think it was the perfect combination,

03:40.016 --> 03:42.182
because we had Eazy.

03:42.183 --> 03:44.307
He's comin' from this hardcore,

03:44.308 --> 03:46.724
drug-dealin', street perspective.

03:46.725 --> 03:48.682
And Cube would come in

03:48.683 --> 03:51.349
with the more Malcolm X political voice.

03:51.350 --> 03:52.807
You goddamn right.

03:52.808 --> 03:54.516
The angry rapper, so to speak.

03:54.517 --> 03:57.182
I was tryin' to be street,

03:57.183 --> 03:59.307
but commercial at the same time,

03:59.308 --> 04:01.349
because I wanted the record to sell.

04:01.350 --> 04:03.432
And Ren was the hot voice

04:03.433 --> 04:07.098
that bridged these two perspectives.

04:07.099 --> 04:09.474
D.O.C. wrote a lot of Eazy's lyrics,

04:09.475 --> 04:13.098
but he was always
meant to be a solo act.

04:13.099 --> 04:17.307
So, Eazy, Cube, Ren, Yella, and myself,

04:17.308 --> 04:19.641
we decided to create a group.

04:19.642 --> 04:21.932
And we wanted to be
a little bit shocking,

04:21.933 --> 04:23.848
so you listen to what
we're tryin' to say.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.307
There was a war on gangs at the time,

04:28.308 --> 04:31.224
which means, if you think
I look like a gangbanger,

04:31.225 --> 04:32.307
it's a war on me.

04:32.308 --> 04:34.973
So, we wanted to show
the world our world.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.599
We just wanted
to put Compton on the map.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.890
Gangbangin', crack cocaine,

04:39.891 --> 04:42.307
Daryl Gates, the LAPD,

04:42.308 --> 04:43.557
Reaganomics.

04:43.558 --> 04:44.599
That was our formula.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.517
We were just ghetto reporters.

04:48.808 --> 04:52.516
And then Dre and Eazy pulled up one day,

04:52.517 --> 04:55.599
and said, "We got a name for the group."

04:55.600 --> 04:57.557
And I was like, "What is it?"

04:57.558 --> 04:58.767
He said, "N.W.A."

05:00.141 --> 05:03.349
And I thought, "What the fuck?

05:03.350 --> 05:06.015
That's initials. What does that mean?"

05:06.016 --> 05:07.724
And he was like, "Niggaz Wit Attitudes."

05:07.725 --> 05:10.766
And I was like, "Oh, hell, yeah."

05:10.767 --> 05:12.516
You know what I mean? It was like...

05:12.517 --> 05:14.682
"Oh, yeah. Yeah."

05:14.683 --> 05:16.098
That's the name for this group.

♪ It's all right ♪

09:31.238 --> 09:35.057
We sat down, and
I played him the songs I had...

09:35.058 --> 09:38.140
He played me
"Here Comes My Girl," and "Refugee."

09:38.141 --> 09:40.015
...and he got really excited.

09:40.016 --> 09:41.557
I just looked him, I said,

09:41.558 --> 09:43.890
"Get another eight songs
quick, 'cause we're done."

09:43.891 --> 09:46.682
And he goes, "We're gonna be
millionaires," you know?

09:46.683 --> 09:49.140
And I thought that
was the strangest comment

09:49.141 --> 09:51.182
I'd ever heard about music.

09:51.183 --> 09:52.432
You know?

09:52.433 --> 09:55.432
But when you're that age,
the sky's the limit.

09:55.433 --> 09:58.682
Jimmy became so obsessed

09:58.683 --> 10:01.641
with getting the right
take on that song.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.516
- I'll bet we did over 100.
- I think we should do one more.

10:04.517 --> 10:05.890
We just were so connected.

10:05.891 --> 10:08.390
We would work 12 hours,
and then talk for three hours.

10:08.391 --> 10:09.766
We were thick as thieves.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.265
And we had a plan to conquer the world.

10:12.266 --> 10:14.265

10:14.266 --> 10:16.349

10:16.350 --> 10:17.932

10:17.933 --> 10:20.557
♪ And turned around and let him go ♪

10:20.558 --> 10:22.307
When they released that record,

10:22.308 --> 10:25.766
Jim turned into a tornado of promotion.

10:25.767 --> 10:28.807
I wanted to have some
influence in the marketing,

10:28.808 --> 10:30.390
because when you finish the record,

10:30.391 --> 10:32.557
you go play it for somebody,
and they just go,

10:32.558 --> 10:34.432
"That doesn't sound
like your last record."

10:34.433 --> 10:37.724
And you're in there saying, "Of course
it doesn't sound like the last record.

10:37.725 --> 10:39.641
"It's not supposed to sound
like the last record.

10:39.642 --> 10:42.098
The whole concept is to not
sound like somebody else."

10:42.099 --> 10:45.265
Not like everything else.

10:45.266 --> 10:48.432
So, I started sayin', "I got
to get control of our destiny

10:48.433 --> 10:50.224
"or else, we're handing
these records to people

10:50.225 --> 10:52.432
that want us to sound
like what's on the radio."

10:52.433 --> 10:56.015
He was really, really dedicated

10:56.016 --> 10:58.973
and doing very well
on that side of things.

10:58.974 --> 11:03.932
One thing about him is he's always
known what people to be hanging with.

11:03.933 --> 11:05.098
♪ Don't do me like that ♪

11:05.099 --> 11:08.098
And Stevie Nicks had shown up,

11:08.099 --> 11:10.432
and wanted to hang out.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.766
She had lots of people around.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.932
That, really, I couldn't figure
out what their jobs were,

11:15.933 --> 11:18.766
you know, and gypsy girls.

11:18.767 --> 11:21.724
And I was just kind of
confused by it all.

11:37.517 --> 11:41.140
♪ You can run high atop your pony ♪

11:41.141 --> 11:43.557

11:43.558 --> 11:48.266
♪ 'Cause the whole thing's phony ♪

11:52.642 --> 11:54.308
That's "Bella Donna."

11:55.849 --> 11:57.224
When I first met Jimmy,

11:57.225 --> 12:00.516
we went out to dinner,
and about ten days later,

12:00.517 --> 12:02.224
I moved in to Jimmy's house,

12:02.225 --> 12:04.807
when Tom was finishing
Damn the Torpedoes,

12:04.808 --> 12:06.015
but nobody knew.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.349
I mean, certainly Tom Petty didn't know.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.307
Jimmy didn't want Tom Petty to know

12:10.308 --> 12:12.474
because he felt that
Tom would feel like,

12:12.475 --> 12:16.474
"Well, I guess your interest has been
slightly taken away from my record now."

12:16.475 --> 12:18.015
And for the next several months,

12:18.016 --> 12:20.307
I spent a lot of time
making English muffins

12:20.308 --> 12:23.641
with mozzarella cheese
and tomato in the broiler.

12:23.642 --> 12:24.848
That's what we lived on.

12:24.849 --> 12:27.057
I was the mini-baby pizza maker.

12:27.058 --> 12:28.224
I liked him,

12:28.225 --> 12:29.932
and he totally liked me.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.015
I mean, we liked each other.

12:32.016 --> 12:35.098
You know, I was an
up-and-coming record producer,

12:35.099 --> 12:36.599
and she was a big star,

12:36.600 --> 12:40.098
so Danny Goldberg,
Paul Fishkin, and Doug Morris

12:40.099 --> 12:44.349
asked me to produce Stevie's first
solo album outside of Fleetwood Mac.

12:44.350 --> 12:47.432
I wanted Jimmy
because Jimmy produced Tom,

12:47.433 --> 12:49.057
because I loved Tom's records.

12:49.058 --> 12:51.224
We started hanging out, and it was fun.

12:51.225 --> 12:54.224
But Tom and I were
very, very close at that time,

12:54.225 --> 12:55.641
and it was really awkward.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.474
Jimmy's like, "You don't know Tom.

12:57.475 --> 12:59.307
"Tom doesn't know you.

12:59.308 --> 13:01.182
"And when Tom comes over here,

13:01.183 --> 13:03.098
you have to hide in the basement."

13:03.099 --> 13:04.349
So, I did,

13:04.350 --> 13:05.557
because it was a nice basement,

13:05.558 --> 13:08.098
and actually it was
a whole Rock and Roll 101

13:08.099 --> 13:10.973
outside of Fleetwood Mac for
me when Tom would come over.

13:10.974 --> 13:13.225
And of course,
I would be like, you know...

13:14.683 --> 13:17.057
- Try and understand one thing.
- ♪ Lovely stars... ♪

13:17.058 --> 13:19.140
If you make an alteration of some sort,

13:19.141 --> 13:21.848
if we say, "Hey, you know, this is
not right, it's not exactly right.

13:21.849 --> 13:24.390
Does not mean, okay, panic
city time, Needle Park.

13:24.391 --> 13:26.349
- We're trying to get it right, Jim, for you.
- I know...

13:26.374 --> 13:28.074
- Stevie... intentions are right.
- And so we can't...

13:28.099 --> 13:30.013
- All I'm tryin' to say...
- We can't, you know, do it without talking.

13:30.065 --> 13:32.700
Stevie, again. Again, Stevie,
this is what I'm talking about.

13:32.725 --> 13:35.057
Everytime I say something,
it's like a lawyer.

13:35.058 --> 13:38.682
It's like a group of lawyers,
which is completely unnecessary.

13:38.683 --> 13:40.766
I don't feel we should try
a different high part.

13:40.767 --> 13:41.932
Stevie, that's not the point.

13:41.933 --> 13:44.724
- But just to be... be a lawyer.
- Okay.

13:44.725 --> 13:46.675
You know? Okay.

13:46.862 --> 13:48.404
Come on, let's go.

13:50.683 --> 13:54.349
Jimmy and I would
get in a lot of arguments.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.432
About music, about what I wanted,

13:56.433 --> 13:57.932
and what he thought I wanted,

13:57.933 --> 14:00.224
for instance, the single.

14:00.225 --> 14:02.932
They didn't have a single

14:02.933 --> 14:04.932
that was gonna break the album.

14:04.933 --> 14:08.932
And she started coming
by the sessions quite a bit,

14:08.933 --> 14:10.973
and she was right up front.

14:10.974 --> 14:13.474
She goes, "I want you
to write a song for me."

14:13.475 --> 14:16.599
And I said, "Well...

14:16.600 --> 14:18.516
"I'd like to write a song for me.

14:18.517 --> 14:21.599
You know, I'm... It's not that easy."

14:21.600 --> 14:24.516
So, we had this record going,

14:24.517 --> 14:25.682
Hard Promises,

14:25.683 --> 14:28.682
and I'd written a lot of songs for it,

14:28.683 --> 14:33.140
one of which was
"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around."

14:33.141 --> 14:34.807
And I didn't see

14:34.808 --> 14:38.140
"Stop Draggin' My Heart
Around" as a single.

14:38.141 --> 14:39.641
I kind of put it on the shelf.

14:39.642 --> 14:42.265
Sounded like a blues
record when he did it.

14:42.266 --> 14:44.641
And I heard it...

14:44.642 --> 14:46.724
like a big pop record,

14:46.725 --> 14:48.057
with a girl singing it.

14:48.058 --> 14:49.890
Jimmy says "If I were you,

14:49.891 --> 14:53.932
"I would take this amazing
gift from Tom Petty,

14:53.933 --> 14:55.848
"and put it on your damn album.

14:55.849 --> 14:58.557
Because you don't have a single."

14:58.558 --> 15:00.182
And you're coming out of a group

15:00.183 --> 15:02.682
that has nothing but hit records,

15:02.683 --> 15:05.057
so, you're gonna come out
with this beautiful record,

15:05.058 --> 15:10.057
all with lace and veils
and candles all over it,

15:10.058 --> 15:12.642
and no one's gonna hear it.

15:15.558 --> 15:17.098
Next thing I know,

15:17.099 --> 15:20.641
he rolls in and says, "Hey, I got
something I got to play you."

15:20.642 --> 15:23.973
And he plays me
"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,"

15:23.974 --> 15:26.015
the same track,

15:26.016 --> 15:28.557
with her singing.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.848
Jimmy, you just took the song and...?

15:30.849 --> 15:33.641
I said, "Tom, let's do the
same thing I did with Bruce."

15:33.642 --> 15:35.057
It had worked once.

15:35.058 --> 15:36.432
Why wouldn't it work again?

15:36.433 --> 15:39.057
He knew that
"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"

15:39.058 --> 15:41.057
was a stone-cold hit.

15:41.058 --> 15:43.474
And even more of a stone-cold hit

15:43.475 --> 15:46.057
with Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks
singing it together.

15:46.058 --> 15:47.474
His comeback was, like,

15:47.475 --> 15:50.557
"Hey, this is gonna buy you a house."

15:50.558 --> 15:53.932
And I'm, like, "Okay."

15:53.933 --> 15:58.224
But it pissed me off
because it became a huge hit.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.307
It blows up with him on it.

16:00.308 --> 16:01.599
Then his single comes out,

16:01.600 --> 16:03.516
but it wasn't a big
a hit as it should've been.

16:03.517 --> 16:05.599
They came out at the same time.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.015
So I think our single suffered.

16:58.433 --> 17:01.140
I didn't tell anybody
I was goin' out with Stevie, right?

17:01.141 --> 17:03.807
So that shit always leads to trouble.

17:03.808 --> 17:05.348

17:05.349 --> 17:07.223
amongst friends and stuff like that.

17:07.224 --> 17:09.682
And I was in over my head.

17:12.141 --> 17:15.098
That was the beginning of a
tough time for me and Tom,

17:15.098 --> 17:17.307
because I was goin' out with her.

17:17.308 --> 17:19.516
We had a gigantic hit record.

17:19.517 --> 17:21.140
It looked like hustle.

17:22.517 --> 17:24.890
I mean, did I know that her label was

17:24.891 --> 17:28.973
gonna drop that record
right on top of his record?

17:28.974 --> 17:30.224
No.

17:30.225 --> 17:33.474
But still, it was my
responsibility to have his back.

17:33.475 --> 17:36.599
And my relationship
with Tom was affected,

17:36.600 --> 17:39.140
and it's probably
still affected in some way

17:39.141 --> 17:42.307
because how I handled it was wrong.

17:43.683 --> 17:47.848
I had no idea what
I was doing socially or in life.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.015
I knew one thing.

17:49.016 --> 17:51.224

I went back to the studio,

17:51.225 --> 17:52.599

17:52.600 --> 17:54.599
I felt better and my life
would get better.

consciously did anything

The group was startin'

19:32.308 --> 19:33.432

is that Eazy wanted something commercial

20:53.849 --> 20:57.766
to make radio stations say,
"Oh, Ruthless Records."

20:57.767 --> 21:00.682

Rhythm Rock Live.
We're on location tonight

22:01.433 --> 22:03.766
to talk to probably
the most controversial

22:03.767 --> 22:06.057
rap group in LA right now.

22:06.058 --> 22:10.307
How close are you
to what your records are?

22:10.308 --> 22:12.390
We're just as real as this gun.

22:12.391 --> 22:13.641
See this chamber right there?

22:13.642 --> 22:15.932
That's no bullshit.

22:15.933 --> 22:18.807
Me, Dre, Yella...

22:18.808 --> 22:21.224
we all were into paintball
back in the day.

22:21.225 --> 22:23.098
We were the first black people
into paintball.

22:23.099 --> 22:26.057
We all bought these paint guns,
masks, the whole nine yards.

22:26.058 --> 22:27.599
Drive out to Malibu.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.432
Only black guys out there.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.307
Our crew was called Just Us.

22:33.683 --> 22:36.182
Eazy bought a paintball shotgun.

22:36.183 --> 22:39.807
Everything you hear
on our records is true.

22:39.808 --> 22:43.140
Him and Dre decide to
ride down the Harbor Freeway,

22:43.141 --> 22:44.932
stickin' this paintball shotgun

22:44.933 --> 22:47.265
out the fuckin' window, and bam!

22:47.266 --> 22:50.724
Creatin' havoc on the
motherfuckin' freeway.

22:50.725 --> 22:53.140
Freakin' people the fuck out.

22:53.141 --> 22:55.390
So Highway Patrol
got wind of these fools.

22:55.391 --> 22:58.015
Ten, 15 minutes after that,

22:58.016 --> 22:59.641
the police is behind us.

22:59.642 --> 23:01.641
Pull us out of the car with guns drawn.

23:01.642 --> 23:03.599
Lay us facedown on the freeway.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.349
Really aggressive and the whole
nine, as they should've been.

23:06.350 --> 23:09.307
They jacked these motherfuckers

23:09.308 --> 23:10.848
like they robbed a bank.

23:10.849 --> 23:13.182
They lucky they're alive today.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.224
They come back to my house,

23:14.225 --> 23:16.265
shakin' like a motherfucker, okay?

23:16.266 --> 23:17.766
"Man, fuck the police.
Them motherfuckers,

23:17.767 --> 23:19.224
they did this,
they put guns at our heads."

23:19.225 --> 23:20.641
I said, "What the fuck y'all do?"

23:20.642 --> 23:22.516
"Oh man, all we did was ride
down the street with some...

23:22.517 --> 23:24.432
with the paintball gun,
shootin' at people's cars."

23:24.433 --> 23:25.433
"You did what?!"

23:27.849 --> 23:30.182
Him and Eazy was
runnin' around fuckin' up,

23:30.183 --> 23:31.474
you know what I mean?

23:31.475 --> 23:34.890
So Dre had to check hisself
into jail every weekend.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.224
And as a teenager,

23:37.225 --> 23:39.015
weekends with Dr. Dre,

23:39.016 --> 23:40.016
you were in the club.

23:40.017 --> 23:42.224
You partyin', the music is bangin'.

23:42.225 --> 23:43.390
You're around hip-hop.

23:43.391 --> 23:45.890
He go to jail, all that stopped.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.973
So our weekends was borin'.

23:47.974 --> 23:49.973
Bump. We was back on the block.

23:49.974 --> 23:51.848
We was just not doin' nothin'.

23:51.849 --> 23:55.098
So I was just mad
that all the fun stopped,

23:55.099 --> 23:57.599
and Dre had to go to jail till Monday.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.557
So I wrote "Fuck Tha Police,"
you know what I mean?

24:00.558 --> 24:03.224
Because it was, like, enough is enough.

24:08.308 --> 24:10.890
I knew it was...

24:10.891 --> 24:12.057
the shit.

24:12.058 --> 24:14.516
But when I said it to Dre,

24:14.517 --> 24:16.766
he was like, "Dude,
I'm not doin' that record.

24:16.767 --> 24:18.349
"I got to go to jail Friday.

24:18.350 --> 24:19.890
"They gonna kick my ass up in there.

24:19.891 --> 24:20.933
I ain't 'bout to do that."

24:22.141 --> 24:25.390
So I ripped it out...

24:25.391 --> 24:28.350
and balled it up and threw it away.

24:31.391 --> 24:33.932
And my friend, Phoenix Phil

24:33.933 --> 24:35.224
reached in the trash,

24:35.225 --> 24:37.182
and was, like, "Naw. This is too good."

24:37.183 --> 24:40.098
And he spread it out
and put it back in my notebook.

24:40.099 --> 24:42.098
"You can't throw this song away."

24:42.099 --> 24:45.557
So when it was time
to do the N.W.A. record

24:45.558 --> 24:48.098
and we was thinkin' of all these ideas,

24:48.099 --> 24:49.766
I waited till everybody was in the room.

24:49.767 --> 24:52.140
And I was, like, "Man, I got a
record called 'Fuck Tha Police.'"

24:53.266 --> 24:54.766
D.O.C. went crazy.

24:54.767 --> 24:56.766
Whoever thought of this shit was genius.

24:56.767 --> 24:58.265
Ren almost did a backflip.

24:58.266 --> 25:01.057
Eazy was like, "Say it.
Let's go. Let me hear it."

25:01.058 --> 25:02.516
Yeah, do it.

25:02.517 --> 25:05.724
Wow. We really gonna talk
about the police like that?

25:05.725 --> 25:08.641
I knew we had something
that was gonna be dangerous.

25:08.642 --> 25:09.724
I knew we had somethin' that

25:09.725 --> 25:11.474
we could potentially get in trouble for,

25:11.475 --> 25:14.390
something the group
was really excited about,

25:14.391 --> 25:16.098
and proud of because
of the way it sounded.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.599
I mean, we did the whole
court thing at the beginnin'.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.349
I played the judge, and...

25:20.350 --> 25:22.682
D.O.C. was playin'
the lawyer on the record.

25:22.683 --> 25:24.349
Judge Dre residing.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.057
In the case of N.W.A.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.766
versus the Police Department,

25:27.767 --> 25:29.973
prosecuting attorneys are:

25:29.974 --> 25:32.224
MC Ren, Ice Cube,

25:32.225 --> 25:34.057
and Eazy-motherfuckin'-E.

25:34.058 --> 25:35.307
Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.

25:35.308 --> 25:36.390
Order in the court.

25:36.391 --> 25:38.516
Ice Cube, take the motherfuckin' stand.

25:38.517 --> 25:40.307

25:40.308 --> 25:42.890

The FBI letter.

27:07.308 --> 27:08.432
There was no precedent

27:08.433 --> 27:10.265
to the FBI sending a letter,

27:10.266 --> 27:12.600
"Please stop singing these records."

27:14.350 --> 27:17.307
When that came through,
the news was all over that.

27:17.308 --> 27:20.516
And then, of course,
with media and controversy,

27:20.517 --> 27:22.390
it all just worked to sell more records.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.098
Because N.W.A., they were like,

27:24.099 --> 27:26.098
"No, we're gonna go right back at that.

27:26.099 --> 27:27.265
We're gonna do these records."

27:27.266 --> 27:30.265
Eazy was clearly a marketing genius.

27:30.266 --> 27:33.474
He had a great sense
for what buttons to push

27:33.475 --> 27:35.891
to create controversy
in different levels.

27:37.058 --> 27:41.516
It became political once
these forces start comin' against us.

27:41.517 --> 27:45.224
It let us know that
we're more than a group.

27:45.837 --> 27:48.973
We're a political statement.

27:48.974 --> 27:51.600
It just knocked us into that position.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.848
I remember bein' on tour

28:07.849 --> 28:11.516
somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

28:11.517 --> 28:13.641
I'm wakin' up. We were asleep,

28:13.642 --> 28:15.182
and the bus was stopped.

28:15.183 --> 28:18.557
And I hear cryin'.

28:18.558 --> 28:20.807
And I go to the back of the bus,

28:20.808 --> 28:23.307
and it was Dre.

28:23.308 --> 28:25.224
I had a call...

28:25.225 --> 28:27.475
and it was about my brother Tyree.

28:30.350 --> 28:32.807
Andre was his idol,

28:32.808 --> 28:36.015
and I think he wanted
to be like his big brother.

28:36.016 --> 28:39.140
And he had started writin' little raps.

28:39.141 --> 28:41.973
Tyree was gonna come on tour.

28:41.974 --> 28:44.015
But I don't think
Dre was gonna let him come.

28:44.016 --> 28:46.890
So it was like,
"If I had let him come..."

28:51.767 --> 28:54.015
And I used to always warn them

28:54.016 --> 28:57.140
about cruisin' Crenshaw,

28:57.141 --> 28:59.682
and there was a confrontation.

28:59.683 --> 29:02.516
And this big guy, they
said he came from nowhere,

29:02.517 --> 29:03.848
out of the back seat or somethin'

29:03.849 --> 29:06.349
and grabbed Tyree and slammed him.

29:06.350 --> 29:08.349
Well, I think it broke...

29:08.350 --> 29:11.015
I think it broke his neck, and, uh...

29:11.016 --> 29:13.308
and so, when, uh...

29:15.517 --> 29:17.683
So, when I got back, and...

29:19.391 --> 29:21.973
I see two men

29:21.974 --> 29:25.265
standing at the door with briefcases.

29:25.266 --> 29:28.890
"Ma'am, your son was
involved in an altercation,

29:28.891 --> 29:31.099
and he didn't regain conscious."

29:32.642 --> 29:34.973
I don't remember anything.

29:34.974 --> 29:39.140
All I know, is that I was down
at about three blocks,

29:39.141 --> 29:41.517
running and screaming.

29:42.725 --> 29:43.932
Mm-hmm.

29:47.849 --> 29:50.224
And I remember him leaving off the tour,

29:50.225 --> 29:51.432
to go to the funeral.

29:51.433 --> 29:53.182
He went home.

29:53.183 --> 29:55.725
And he missed one show. I remember that.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.098
I remember him coming in,

30:00.099 --> 30:03.932
and that was the first time
that I had seen him cry,

30:03.933 --> 30:06.724
except for when he was a little kid.

30:06.725 --> 30:08.683
He didn't take it very well.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.057
When Dre came back,

30:12.058 --> 30:14.098
I was thinkin', like,
he was gonna be, like,

30:14.099 --> 30:15.599
just down, you feel what I'm sayin'?

30:15.600 --> 30:17.557
But he held it together, man.

30:17.558 --> 30:19.098
He was strong, like, just come back

30:19.099 --> 30:21.390
and pick it back up
like nothin' ever happened.

30:21.391 --> 30:22.724
He was back to normal.

30:22.725 --> 30:23.932
When he came back, it was just, like,

30:23.933 --> 30:26.265
"Okay, let's do it.
Let's finish this tour."

30:26.266 --> 30:28.432
But I just know...
like, I noticed that, uh,

30:28.433 --> 30:29.516
it was a change in Dre.

30:29.517 --> 30:31.973
Like, I think the drinking
was happening.

30:31.974 --> 30:33.932
Like, 'cause he was
never really a drinker.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.015
He just was heavy.

30:35.016 --> 30:38.599
He went from that
lighthearted Dre to heavy.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.641
You know, here he is

30:40.642 --> 30:43.265
at the height of, you know, popularity,

30:43.266 --> 30:45.973
and he didn't seem happy.

30:53.099 --> 30:55.265
Every time that I felt
like I was at the bottom,

30:55.266 --> 30:57.141
it's always been because of death.

31:00.141 --> 31:01.808
What happens at the bottom?

31:03.933 --> 31:06.349
It's like, you know...

31:06.350 --> 31:09.307
It's almost like I can
identify with somebody

31:09.308 --> 31:11.140
that's on drugs, that's at the bottom.

31:11.141 --> 31:13.890
You just... you just feel fuckin' empty,

31:13.891 --> 31:16.307
like there's nothin' left here for you.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.349
It's just like, "Why
the fuck am I here?"

31:18.350 --> 31:20.973
You know what I mean?
"And what the fuck am I doin'?

31:20.974 --> 31:23.973
There's nothin' that's
important to me anymore."

31:23.974 --> 31:26.141
What the longest you
been in that space though?

31:28.475 --> 31:29.516
You're never out of that space,

31:29.517 --> 31:31.015
especially when it comes to death.

31:31.016 --> 31:33.973
When it comes to death,
if it's somebody that...

31:33.974 --> 31:36.349
you really love like a brother or a son,

31:36.350 --> 31:37.848
you're never out of that space.

31:37.849 --> 31:40.349
You just figure out
ways to deal with it,

31:40.350 --> 31:42.307
because...

31:42.308 --> 31:45.224
there are still people
here that need me.

31:45.225 --> 31:48.599
So I gotta pick my shit up and...

31:48.600 --> 31:51.390
suck it up and get active, man.

31:51.391 --> 31:54.349
And turn to music as an outlet

31:54.350 --> 31:57.057
to have a place to go,

31:57.058 --> 32:00.973
like the studio to be creative.

32:00.974 --> 32:03.848
It absolutely, like...

32:03.849 --> 32:05.516
it help...

32:05.517 --> 32:09.349
get your mind out of the dark areas.

32:09.350 --> 32:11.724
You know what I'm sayin'?

32:11.725 --> 32:13.599
And, um...

32:13.600 --> 32:15.517
that's my way of copin' with it.

32:28.391 --> 32:30.724
After we finished our tour,

32:30.725 --> 32:32.557
I had to pick myself up,

32:32.558 --> 32:33.848
and just strive,

32:33.849 --> 32:37.224
because the loss of my
brother, my best friend.

32:37.225 --> 32:41.265
I was really determined
to be a success, you know?

32:41.266 --> 32:44.182
We're buildin' from ground up,
and we have artists comin'.

32:44.183 --> 32:46.724
We've got Michel'le, Above The Law.

32:46.725 --> 32:48.307
We've got The D.O.C.

32:48.308 --> 32:52.224
And me and D.O.C. had already
created a friendship and a bond.

32:52.225 --> 32:54.265
D-O-motherfuckin'-C in the house.

32:54.266 --> 32:57.557
Almost like a big brother,
little brother type thing.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.265
And for me, it's like he came in

33:00.266 --> 33:02.766
and filled this space that was missin'.

33:02.767 --> 33:06.140
And, um, it really motivated me

33:06.141 --> 33:08.682
to make sure that
his record was the shit.

33:08.683 --> 33:10.848
I'm gonna be a big star one day, man.

What's weird is,

36:05.600 --> 36:09.265
after that record came out
and... and that thing happened,

36:09.266 --> 36:11.599
it was a real problem even listenin'

36:11.600 --> 36:13.098
to that stuff, you know?

36:13.099 --> 36:16.724
'Cause I was pretty good,
you know, back in the days, man.

36:16.725 --> 36:19.390
But my job was just to play my role

36:19.391 --> 36:21.599
to help them build their art.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.807
And I don't think
anybody was in the studio,

36:23.808 --> 36:25.973
besides Dre, more than me.

36:25.974 --> 36:28.349
You know, because I went when he went.

36:28.350 --> 36:29.557
When he went home, I went home.

36:29.558 --> 36:33.224
And when the interviews came
and they would sit down,

36:33.225 --> 36:35.973
I would have to stand just
outside of frame, you know?

36:35.974 --> 36:39.807
And they would talk
about stuff that I wrote.

36:39.808 --> 36:41.057
"Why you gotta call us bitches."

36:41.058 --> 36:42.890
She call... right off,
she callin' herself a bitch.

36:42.891 --> 36:44.599
And I think to myself, "That ain't it.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.973
That ain't why I wrote that."

36:45.974 --> 36:49.307
And I gotta sit in the chair
like... You know?

36:49.308 --> 36:50.848
And it was tough. It's tough.

36:50.849 --> 36:52.807
It was tough for a 19, 20-year-old kid

36:52.808 --> 36:55.516
to have to deal with that emotion.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.932
But doin' my record, it was great.

36:58.933 --> 37:02.973
You know, it was, uh...
I felt validated.

37:02.974 --> 37:04.599
And when they tell you
you're the greatest,

37:04.600 --> 37:07.349
then didn't take me long
before I start...

37:07.350 --> 37:09.932
"Hmm. Maybe I am the greatest."

37:09.933 --> 37:12.766
And so maybe I started

37:12.767 --> 37:16.141
really goin' overboard
then with the excesses.

37:17.683 --> 37:18.807
I had it all.

37:18.808 --> 37:22.807
It was right here. It was right here.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.516
And within...

37:25.517 --> 37:27.891
moments, it was all gone.

37:47.141 --> 37:49.349
I really did love Jimmy,

37:49.350 --> 37:53.183
but I just couldn't be
that person in his life.

37:55.725 --> 37:58.057
There was a lot of
drugs around, you know,

37:58.058 --> 38:00.557
and I was always such a control freak

38:00.558 --> 38:04.015
that it got in the way
of work and things like that.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.890
It, um, it got nuts and...

38:05.891 --> 38:07.390
There was just a point that...

38:07.391 --> 38:09.682
where it was like, "I can't
do this to him anymore.

38:09.683 --> 38:11.641
"If love is love and I love this man,

38:11.642 --> 38:12.766
"and I care about him,

38:12.767 --> 38:17.265
"I cannot morally
hurt him anymore over this.

38:17.266 --> 38:20.016
And this situation is not
gonna get better for a while."

38:21.475 --> 38:23.557
After Stevie and I broke up,

38:23.558 --> 38:25.516
I was really lonely,
and I was freaked out.

38:25.517 --> 38:27.391
I didn't know
what the hell was goin' on.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.307
The '80s were tough for me,

38:30.308 --> 38:33.807
because where I had been
into breaking artists

38:33.808 --> 38:37.932
I had suddenly moved to Dire Straits,

38:37.933 --> 38:41.890
Stevie Nicks and Bob Seger,
which were successful artists.

38:41.891 --> 38:45.349
The A&R guys didn't want
to give me the new artists.

38:45.350 --> 38:46.890
Thought I was too expensive,

38:46.891 --> 38:49.641
thought I would,
you know, take too long.

38:49.642 --> 38:52.390
I have too much to say,
or whatever the stuff is

38:52.391 --> 38:54.099
that people at the labels think.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.057
And maybe rightfully so,

38:57.058 --> 38:59.516
they thought it about me.

38:59.517 --> 39:01.141
So I was really down.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.098
My mother and
I, being at home in New York,

39:06.099 --> 39:08.015
and Jimmy's in California by himself,

39:08.016 --> 39:09.140
we're worried.

39:09.141 --> 39:10.682
Is he eating? Does he have food?

39:10.683 --> 39:16.224
So every vacation
we took was to California.

39:16.225 --> 39:19.098
To support him, or to see
where he was in his career.

39:19.099 --> 39:21.848
Because his success wasn't complete

39:21.849 --> 39:24.432
unless we could enjoy it with him.

39:24.433 --> 39:26.349
And Jimmy liked us around,

39:26.350 --> 39:29.390
because he had somebody
to take care of him.

39:29.391 --> 39:31.932
But when Vicki came into the picture,

39:31.933 --> 39:34.682
she was my mom and I together...

39:34.683 --> 39:36.057
you know, self-sufficient.

39:36.058 --> 39:38.517
She was smart. She was gorgeous.

39:41.099 --> 39:42.349
She was a lawyer

39:42.350 --> 39:44.516
from Cambridge University in England

39:44.517 --> 39:46.557
and Hastings and Berkeley.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.641
And, yeah, she was a Playboy centerfold.

39:48.642 --> 39:50.973
But I like strong personality women.

39:50.974 --> 39:52.224
I like women that have an idea

39:52.225 --> 39:53.265
of how they want to live

39:53.266 --> 39:55.140
and what they want to do.

39:55.141 --> 39:57.474
And she was incredible.

39:57.475 --> 39:58.932
I was at a party,

39:58.933 --> 40:01.848
and there was Jimmy,
and he followed me out,

40:01.849 --> 40:03.641
And he said, "If you give
me your phone number,

40:03.642 --> 40:05.848
and I remember it, can I call you?"

40:05.849 --> 40:08.766
He called me about
10 times the next day,

40:08.767 --> 40:10.766
and he asks me on a date.

40:10.767 --> 40:13.807
And when it was the appointed hour,

40:13.808 --> 40:17.682
a maroon limousine pulls up
in front of my house.

40:17.683 --> 40:18.932
I get in. There's no Jimmy.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.349
But there are napkins
with my name printed on them,

40:21.350 --> 40:23.307
and matches with my name
printed on them.

40:23.308 --> 40:25.182
So I'm thinking, "This is so weird.

40:25.183 --> 40:26.682
Where is this guy?"

40:26.683 --> 40:29.265
And then I realize we're on our way

40:29.266 --> 40:31.599
to his house to pick him up.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.432
That should've been my first indication.

40:33.433 --> 40:36.224
He doesn't want to wait for people.

40:39.683 --> 40:41.390
This is Vicki McCarty

40:41.391 --> 40:43.224
for the Westwood One Satellite Network.

40:43.225 --> 40:47.307
I'm backstage with Bono Vox from U2.

40:47.308 --> 40:50.265
- Could I just correct you there?
- Yeah, I wish you would.

40:50.266 --> 40:53.140
My full name is Paul David Hewson.

40:53.141 --> 40:54.390
People call me Bono.

40:54.391 --> 40:55.973
Should I call you Paul or Bono?

40:55.974 --> 40:57.890
Call me Bono.

41:24.016 --> 41:25.390
And we were being interviewed

41:25.391 --> 41:29.182
by this rather attractive
Irish-American journalist,

41:29.183 --> 41:31.098
Vicki McCarty.

41:31.099 --> 41:33.474
And she was, like,
pushin' this other dude.

It turns out, her boyfriend, saying,

42:03.475 --> 42:05.973
there was nothing I was gonna
have in common with Jimmy.

42:05.974 --> 42:07.724
Because we were comin' out of punk rock.

42:07.725 --> 42:11.516
And punk rock was not
about shiny things.

42:11.517 --> 42:14.807
Actually, it was about
defacing shiny things.

42:14.808 --> 42:18.265
And Jimmy was a bit slick for us.

42:18.266 --> 42:20.848
But he... he happens to you.

42:20.849 --> 42:22.807
He's like a virus...

42:26.933 --> 42:28.932

43:05.558 --> 43:07.599

into the studio with him.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.682
He would not take no for an answer.

43:09.683 --> 43:13.307
So we did Under a Blood Red Sky.
It was a live album.

43:13.308 --> 43:16.516
And we went to New York
to do the mixing.

43:16.517 --> 43:17.932
And he showed us around New York.

43:17.933 --> 43:19.641
And that's where we really understood

43:19.642 --> 43:21.848
the Italian aspect of him...

43:21.849 --> 43:23.390
the family, the food.

43:23.391 --> 43:25.973
You know, that's when
we realized that really

43:25.974 --> 43:27.682
Irish people are Italians.

43:27.683 --> 43:29.182
It's just we don't eat as well,

43:29.183 --> 43:32.390
we don't dress as well,
we don't play soccer as well.

44:04.558 --> 44:06.557
Larry is coming in

44:06.558 --> 44:09.766
on the tom-tom, on the bass
drum, starts playing it again,

44:09.767 --> 44:11.265
so it never really stops.

44:11.266 --> 44:13.057
- Yeah.
- I think that could work.

44:13.058 --> 44:15.932
A great idea has a lot in common

44:15.933 --> 44:16.973
with a great melody,

44:16.974 --> 44:20.599
and Jimmy's gift is the clear thought.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.766
But also outside of music,

44:22.767 --> 44:24.766
in the room, the clear thought.

44:24.767 --> 44:27.349
When others hear
harmony or counterpoint,

44:27.350 --> 44:28.766
he hears the clear melody.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.557
So he applies that wherever he is.

44:30.558 --> 44:33.557
Why don't you sing what you
sang me when I first got here?

44:33.558 --> 44:36.265
- Um...
- Do you remember it?

44:36.266 --> 44:37.641
Yeah, well, that was more like...

44:37.642 --> 44:39.599
- It was more like...
- It was a little different than that.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.098
There was a little more to it.

44:41.099 --> 44:44.182
It was more like a... lyrical idea.

44:44.183 --> 44:46.682
It sounded really good.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.432
Bono and I hit it off.

44:48.433 --> 44:49.848
We became friends.

44:49.849 --> 44:54.099
But that was the beginning
of, um, a tough time for me.

45:05.141 --> 45:07.807
Jerry, Yella's on One.

45:07.808 --> 45:11.349
You know, you're talkin'
about the most controversial time

45:11.350 --> 45:13.557
in the history of the music business.

45:13.558 --> 45:16.224
I'm the general manager
of Ruthless Records.

45:16.225 --> 45:18.641
I'm Eazy-E's personal manager.

45:18.642 --> 45:21.432
And it might be oversimplifying

45:21.433 --> 45:24.641
by saying that
I financialize his dreams.

45:24.642 --> 45:28.349
- But probably that's what I do.
- And playback!

45:41.225 --> 45:42.682
Yo, yo, yo!

45:42.683 --> 45:44.848
Yo, we in the house. Eazy and Dr. Dre's

46:09.891 --> 46:12.349
after years of nickels and dimes.

46:12.350 --> 46:16.265
Now we'd be able to buy houses, cars.

46:16.266 --> 46:17.641
Rich.

46:17.642 --> 46:19.599
That was the first
time we ever had contracts.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.557
But Cube wanted somebody
to look at the paperwork.

46:21.558 --> 46:23.057
I still got me a little Jeep.

46:23.058 --> 46:24.557
I'm at my mother house.

46:24.558 --> 46:26.682
Now, this is when the trouble started.

46:26.683 --> 46:28.390
Ice Cube left in a bitter dispute.

46:32.266 --> 46:33.973
I don't like the manager,

46:33.974 --> 46:35.890
'cause he wasn't payin' me my money.

46:35.891 --> 46:37.724
That's the bottom line. Bottom line.

46:37.725 --> 46:40.307
That's it. No more N.W.A.

46:40.308 --> 46:42.683
No more N.W.A. questions, please.

46:44.225 --> 46:45.557
You're gonna leave?

46:50.266 --> 46:52.224
I got Cube on the phone.

46:52.225 --> 46:53.641
He felt he was gettin' fucked,

46:53.642 --> 46:55.932
and Jerry was the reason for it,

46:55.933 --> 46:58.015
and Eazy was condonin' it.

46:58.016 --> 46:59.307
He was talkin' to me about,

46:59.308 --> 47:02.015
"Dre, you gotta take a look
at your financials, dude."

47:02.016 --> 47:04.307
And then Suge Knight
enters the building.

47:04.308 --> 47:06.432
D.O.C. introduced me to him.

47:06.433 --> 47:07.932
Suge was my guy.

47:07.933 --> 47:10.349
Big-ass dude. Super friendly.

47:10.350 --> 47:14.182
And Suge says, "Let me take you
to this guy. He can help us out."

47:14.183 --> 47:16.098
So Suge took my contracts

47:16.099 --> 47:18.432
to a guy named Dick Griffey.

47:18.433 --> 47:19.599
He started tellin' me

47:19.600 --> 47:21.390
I should be getting
this amount of money,

47:21.391 --> 47:23.432
and this amount of points
for each record.

47:23.433 --> 47:24.973
And you're only getting this.

47:24.974 --> 47:26.724
So I'm, like, "Okay."

47:26.725 --> 47:29.682
Went back to the studio not knowin'

47:29.683 --> 47:32.848
if Eazy knows about this shit or not.

47:32.849 --> 47:35.015
And Eazy is just goin' crazy.

47:35.016 --> 47:37.182
"Fuck Cube this, fuck Cube that."

47:37.183 --> 47:38.641
Somebody start shootin'.

47:38.642 --> 47:40.807
Up until then,
everything that we had done

47:40.808 --> 47:42.848
was like the ultimate brotherhood,

47:42.849 --> 47:44.807
at least, from my perspective.

47:44.808 --> 47:48.307
And all of a sudden,
it just turned into business,

47:48.308 --> 47:50.098
and it turned into pressure.

47:50.099 --> 47:51.807
You know, there was
a lot of distractions,

47:51.808 --> 47:54.516
but to me, Dre had always
seemed driven in the studio.

47:54.517 --> 47:57.474
Had people comin' in
playing bass and instruments,

47:57.475 --> 47:59.599
and so it was a lot more funk to it.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.641
I'm tryin' to prove
myself as an engineer,

48:01.642 --> 48:05.224
as an artist, as a
producer without Cube.

48:05.225 --> 48:08.724
For me, it all became
just a point to make.

48:08.725 --> 48:12.349
Cube was, I'd like to say,
the spirit of N.W.A.

48:12.350 --> 48:17.015
His anti-establishment feel
drove that early sound.

48:17.016 --> 48:18.932
And Cube's our lead guy.

48:18.933 --> 48:20.265
He's gone, so I'm hearin'

48:20.266 --> 48:21.848
different shit around the streets.

48:21.849 --> 48:24.641
"N.W.A. is nothin'. They're gone."

48:24.642 --> 48:26.516
That started touchin'
my ego a little bit.

48:26.517 --> 48:29.224
Find out what's
goin' on on my new solo project.

48:29.225 --> 48:30.349
"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted."

48:30.350 --> 48:32.682
Ah, Cube in y'all ass, man.

48:32.683 --> 48:34.474
What the fuck y'all gonna do?

48:38.808 --> 48:41.140
Pump It Up was a nationally

48:41.141 --> 48:44.057
syndicated music video show.

48:44.058 --> 48:46.015
I was a fan of the music,

48:46.016 --> 48:48.182
so I wanted to present
that to other fans.

48:48.183 --> 48:49.682
Let's see if success and money

48:49.683 --> 48:52.057
has changed the meanest men in rap.

48:52.058 --> 48:53.890
They agreed to do this interview for me,

48:53.891 --> 48:56.057
'cause it was Dee, their home girl.

48:56.058 --> 48:58.557
And the interview
I wound up doin' with N.W.A....

48:58.558 --> 48:59.807
awkward.

48:59.808 --> 49:03.848
Excuse me. Hi. Is Eazy-E here, N.W.A.?

49:03.849 --> 49:05.973
Hey, what's up, you guys? Come here.

49:05.974 --> 49:07.265
- What's up?
- What's up?

49:07.266 --> 49:09.307
Everybody knows this is Eazy-E.

49:09.308 --> 49:10.557
- Yo!
- Dr. Dre.

49:10.558 --> 49:14.265
From the very moment it started,

49:14.266 --> 49:15.973
the energy was bad.

49:15.974 --> 49:17.057
Wow, it's too quiet.

49:17.058 --> 49:18.557
Y'all gotta wake up. Come on, y'all.

49:18.558 --> 49:20.182
It seemed like with every question,

49:20.183 --> 49:23.766
they found a way
to get verbal jabs at Cube.

49:23.767 --> 49:25.641
Do you guys still
communicate with him or...

49:25.642 --> 49:26.807
- Nah.
- Only time we communicate

49:26.808 --> 49:28.474
is when they have
little run-ins, you know.

49:28.475 --> 49:29.766
So the interview's done,

49:29.767 --> 49:31.390
and it hadn't aired yet.

49:31.391 --> 49:34.890
Next thing I know, my producer
wanted to film Ice Cube's rebuttal

49:34.891 --> 49:37.724
and put it in the show with N.W.A.

49:37.725 --> 49:40.848
Personal beef. Let's... let's
milk this for what it is.

49:40.849 --> 49:42.432
This is Ice Cube on Pump It Up.

49:42.433 --> 49:45.015
I got all suckers 100 miles and running.

49:45.016 --> 49:47.474
Like to give a shout out to the D.O.C.

49:47.475 --> 49:48.599
Y'all can't play me.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.932
That was their mentality,
sensationalism.

49:50.933 --> 49:53.265
Sista Dee, always
in the middle of controversy

49:53.266 --> 49:54.641
right here on Pump It Up.

49:54.642 --> 49:59.098
I was 22 at the time. I'm not Oprah.

49:59.099 --> 50:01.057
I didn't know that there's still more

50:01.058 --> 50:02.724
internal struggles in the group.

50:02.725 --> 50:04.057
Not even after Cube left.

50:04.058 --> 50:06.098
I just figured, "Okay, ego."

50:06.099 --> 50:08.432
But out of four remaining, I was like,

50:08.433 --> 50:10.599
"Hmm. Whose ego is gonna be next?"

50:10.600 --> 50:13.265
The ego was a motherfucker.

50:13.266 --> 50:15.766
It's almost like the little pilot light

50:15.767 --> 50:17.766
and fame is the gasoline.

50:17.767 --> 50:19.848
And once gasoline
gets poured on that ego,

50:19.849 --> 50:23.390
you never know if the pilot
light is gonna go out

50:23.391 --> 50:26.015
or if it's gonna turn
into a motherfuckin' bonfire

50:26.016 --> 50:28.642
or some shit that nobody could control.

50:31.642 --> 50:34.641
I remember, uh, us bein' in the studio

50:34.642 --> 50:38.265
and Dre was tryin' to talk
to E about the money.

50:38.266 --> 50:40.724
And E would always be,
like, "Talk to Jerry."

50:40.725 --> 50:42.506
And Dre don't want to talk to Jerry.

50:42.531 --> 50:43.671
I said, "Listen man.

50:43.696 --> 50:46.140
"Fuck all of this goin' back
and forth shit, man.

50:46.141 --> 50:48.432
Either Jerry goes or I go."

50:48.433 --> 50:49.848
And he looked me in my face and said,

50:49.849 --> 50:51.642
"I can't get rid of Jerry."

50:53.558 --> 50:57.183
That was the end of me
and Eazy-E's relationship.

50:58.974 --> 51:02.307
He had to really trust
Jerry to get rid of Dre.

51:02.308 --> 51:05.016
'Cause Dre was the main ingredient.

51:06.225 --> 51:08.517
The feelin' I had at that moment...

51:11.350 --> 51:13.517
was, um...

51:16.391 --> 51:19.516
similar to losin' a brother.

51:19.517 --> 51:21.432
Seriously broke my heart.

51:21.433 --> 51:24.766
All I remember is
walkin' out of the studio

51:24.767 --> 51:27.599
and everything just bein' a blur.

51:27.600 --> 51:31.098
Like a slow motion walk to that car.

51:31.099 --> 51:33.516
There was so many things goin' on

51:33.517 --> 51:35.390
and all the loss.

51:35.391 --> 51:37.432
It was a terrible space
for me at the time.

51:37.433 --> 51:40.182
And I guess, you know...

51:40.183 --> 51:41.973
a lot of people have
their ways of dealin'

51:41.974 --> 51:43.641
with things of that nature.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.391
I turned to alcohol.

51:47.642 --> 51:50.015
So it was the night
before the American Music Awards.

51:50.016 --> 51:52.766
And, um, it was a Def Jam party.

51:52.767 --> 51:55.557
I spotted Dre. He was drunk.

51:55.558 --> 51:57.265
And I think he looked my way,

51:57.266 --> 51:59.057
but he didn't smile.

51:59.058 --> 52:02.265
And it looked like he wasn't
gonna speak to me at all.

52:02.266 --> 52:04.307
And the next thing I know,
he snatched me up.

52:04.308 --> 52:06.057
When I say he snatched me up,

52:06.058 --> 52:07.516
my feet were off the ground.

52:07.517 --> 52:08.682
It was like, "Shit."

52:08.683 --> 52:11.098
You know, like the strength...

52:11.099 --> 52:13.015
and the rage.

52:13.016 --> 52:15.390
And, uh, you know.

52:15.391 --> 52:17.807
Everybody knows the story from there.

52:17.808 --> 52:19.641
In Los Angeles, Dee Barnes,

52:19.642 --> 52:22.224
host of the Fox TV rap show Pump It Up,

52:22.225 --> 52:24.516
is filing a civil suit against Dr. Dre

52:24.517 --> 52:27.432
and claims that
last January at an LA club,

52:27.433 --> 52:28.599
Dre assaulted her,

52:28.600 --> 52:29.724
grabbing her hair,

52:29.725 --> 52:31.682
slamming her face and body into a wall,

52:31.683 --> 52:33.474
and kicking her in the ribs.

52:33.475 --> 52:35.932
Barnes' attorneys say
that Dre was apparently upset

52:35.933 --> 52:38.724
that one of Barnes' producers
inserted her interview

52:38.725 --> 52:40.890
with ex-N.W.A. member Ice Cube

52:40.891 --> 52:44.265
into a Pump It Up show
last winter featuring N.W.A.

52:44.266 --> 52:47.182
N.W.A.'s independent
publicist says, quote,

52:47.183 --> 52:49.265
"I know Dr. Dre as a gentle soul,

52:49.266 --> 52:51.390
the loving father of a baby boy."

52:51.391 --> 52:54.057
I don't think I was
out of touch with reality,

52:54.058 --> 52:55.932
but I was Dr. Dre,

52:55.933 --> 52:59.848
and this was, uh, a very
low point in my life.

52:59.849 --> 53:01.682
And, um...

53:01.683 --> 53:05.848
I've done a lot of
stupid shit in my life,

53:05.849 --> 53:09.140
a lot of things that I wish
I could go and take back.

53:12.808 --> 53:14.265
I've experienced abuse.

53:14.266 --> 53:17.224
I've, um, watched my mother

53:17.225 --> 53:19.307
get abused, you know?

53:19.308 --> 53:20.474
So, it's like,

53:20.475 --> 53:23.307
there's absolutely no excuse for it.

53:23.308 --> 53:26.057
No woman should ever
be treated that way.

53:26.058 --> 53:29.057
Any man that puts his hands on a female

53:29.058 --> 53:30.557
is a fuckin' idiot.

53:30.558 --> 53:32.307
He's out of his fuckin' mind,

53:32.308 --> 53:36.307
and I was out of my
fuckin' mind at the time.

53:36.308 --> 53:37.641
I fucked up.

53:37.642 --> 53:39.848
I paid for it. I'm sorry for it.

53:39.849 --> 53:41.808
And I apologized for it.

53:44.517 --> 53:46.973
I have this dark cloud that follows me,

53:46.974 --> 53:49.973
and it's gonna be
attached to me forever.

53:49.974 --> 53:54.516
It's a major blemish
on who I am as a man.

53:54.517 --> 53:56.057
And every time it comes up,

53:56.058 --> 53:58.182
it just makes me feel fucked up.

53:58.183 --> 54:00.682
So it's just like, what do I do?

54:00.683 --> 54:02.848
What do I do to get rid
of this dark cloud?

54:02.849 --> 54:05.516
I don't know what else to do.

54:05.517 --> 54:07.474
I'm learnin'.

54:07.475 --> 54:09.182
I'm tryin' to become a better person,

54:09.183 --> 54:10.475
become a better man.

54:12.350 --> 54:15.015
From... from a personal standpoint,

54:15.016 --> 54:19.015
I feel like I've handled it well.

54:19.016 --> 54:21.015
I had to stand up

54:21.016 --> 54:22.140
just because I would probably

54:22.141 --> 54:24.224
never forgive myself if I didn't.

54:24.225 --> 54:25.474
Dee Barnes' civil suit

54:25.475 --> 54:27.057
charges him with assault and battery,

54:27.058 --> 54:29.682
inflicting emotional distress,
and defamation.

54:29.683 --> 54:33.474
Barnes seeks damages over $10 million.

54:33.475 --> 54:37.099
I called the police
on Mr. Fuck Tha Police.

54:38.808 --> 54:40.932
But little by little,

54:40.933 --> 54:43.224
the work started dryin' up.

54:43.225 --> 54:46.265
It was as if I had ruined his career

54:46.266 --> 54:49.683
by being that disturbing
footnote in his legacy.

54:51.266 --> 54:53.224
But, um, I went through the...

54:53.225 --> 54:55.807
the anger and the, uh, the dismay,

54:55.808 --> 54:58.766
and you know, I worked...
I worked those things out,

54:58.767 --> 55:01.516
um, to where... to where
I got to a place of peace.

55:01.517 --> 55:03.182
Forgiveness is about...

55:03.183 --> 55:05.015
It's not really about the other person.

55:05.016 --> 55:07.224
Forgiveness is about... for you.

55:07.225 --> 55:08.432
You do it for yourself,

55:08.433 --> 55:10.266
because what are you
gonna do with all that anger?

55:14.266 --> 55:15.391
Hmm.

55:17.099 --> 55:18.890
In the end,

55:18.891 --> 55:20.599
I've hurt people that I care about,

55:20.600 --> 55:23.391
and for that, I'm really sorry.

55:27.266 --> 55:28.641
In 1984,

55:28.642 --> 55:31.766
I went with my father
to his father's funeral.

55:31.767 --> 55:33.224
And the next morning,

55:33.225 --> 55:35.599
I went back to LA and I get
a phone call from my sister

55:35.600 --> 55:37.599
that my dad had a heart attack.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.599
So I rushed back to New York,

55:39.600 --> 55:42.265
and about six weeks later,

55:42.266 --> 55:43.891
his mother died.

55:45.058 --> 55:46.682
And then two days after that,

55:46.683 --> 55:48.807
or somethin' like that, he died.

55:48.808 --> 55:50.890
And at one moment,

55:50.891 --> 55:54.973
he, his mother and his father
all died within six weeks.

55:54.974 --> 55:58.307
And it was easily
the worst day of my life.

55:58.308 --> 56:00.890
It is still the worst day of my life.

56:00.891 --> 56:02.432
We were very, very close.

56:02.433 --> 56:04.516
I had no idea he was gonna die.

56:04.517 --> 56:07.265
He was my best friend
in the whole world.

56:07.266 --> 56:10.433
I think he still is my best
friend in the whole world.

56:13.642 --> 56:16.973
We were very, very
much in mourning, all of us.

56:16.974 --> 56:19.182
This man of 63 years old,

56:19.183 --> 56:21.224
this firecracker, you know,

56:21.225 --> 56:23.265
was just erased, you know.

56:23.266 --> 56:26.848
So, um, Jimmy and Vicki
decided just to get married.

56:26.849 --> 56:29.015
My father died in January,
and Vicki said,

56:29.016 --> 56:30.641
"Well, with your father gone,

56:30.642 --> 56:32.516
"it will never be a good
time to get married.

56:32.517 --> 56:33.807
Let's just do it."

56:33.808 --> 56:35.224
And she was incredible.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.182
I mean, if... if he didn't
have her there, you know,

56:37.183 --> 56:38.557
with him when my father died,

56:38.558 --> 56:39.890
I don't know what would have happened.

56:39.891 --> 56:42.432
Because it was so devastating to him.

56:42.433 --> 56:45.058
I was sittin' on the floor
of my sister's house.

56:47.517 --> 56:50.516
And I said, "I don't know how
I'm gonna get through this.

56:50.517 --> 56:53.015
I just don't know."

56:53.016 --> 56:54.349
So I thought, I know.

56:54.350 --> 56:57.140
My dad loved that
I was in music, you know?

56:57.141 --> 56:59.182
And he loved Christmas.

56:59.183 --> 57:01.265
I said, I'm gonna make a Christmas album

57:01.266 --> 57:02.932
and dedicate it to him

57:02.933 --> 57:04.682
and give all the money to charity.

57:04.683 --> 57:06.724
Get money out of the equation.

57:06.725 --> 57:08.766
Let's use all of our friends.

57:08.767 --> 57:10.558
Let's do something really powerful.

57:11.683 --> 57:14.182
And it sold so many copies

57:14.183 --> 57:15.516
that over the years,

57:15.517 --> 57:19.517
we gave Special Olympics $100 million.

57:21.225 --> 57:23.516
And to do that for my dad

57:23.517 --> 57:24.932
was just everything to me,

57:24.933 --> 57:27.058
and it really helped me move on.

57:31.058 --> 57:34.098
Though he continued to produce records,

57:34.099 --> 57:37.057
he was getting more and more

57:37.058 --> 57:39.057
involved in business.

57:39.058 --> 57:41.724
And I felt like that was overtaking

57:41.725 --> 57:43.558
the artistic side of him.

57:44.683 --> 57:46.557
Like, he did Graham Parker,

57:46.558 --> 57:48.557
and the guys in his band would tell me,

57:48.558 --> 57:50.807
"Look, when we went to the studio,

57:50.808 --> 57:53.724
he never did anything
but talk on the phone."

57:53.725 --> 57:55.307
And I'm not surprised by that,

57:55.308 --> 57:58.432
because more than one time
I took the scissors,

57:58.433 --> 58:01.724
and just cut his line.

58:01.725 --> 58:04.265
You know, I just pffffff, cut it.

58:04.266 --> 58:07.475
Music, you know, we're doing music.

58:10.725 --> 58:12.182
Jimmy, you got water over there?

58:12.183 --> 58:13.475
Yeah, I'm cool.

58:15.642 --> 58:18.432
And see, that was very
hard for any of us to understand.

58:18.433 --> 58:21.098
How could you possibly be
such a great music producer

58:21.099 --> 58:23.224
and actually want to be in a...

58:23.225 --> 58:26.224
in an office with a desk and a phone?

58:27.517 --> 58:29.224
I don't know. I don't...

58:29.225 --> 58:31.848
I don't look at producing
as like this big thing.

58:31.849 --> 58:33.599
You know, I really consider it a job.

58:33.600 --> 58:37.015
I don't consider it any kind
of great achievement.

58:37.016 --> 58:38.724
I really don't. I never did.

58:38.725 --> 58:40.807
I'm there to help a guy make a record.

58:40.808 --> 58:42.848
And...

58:42.849 --> 58:44.641
anybody wants to work with me,
I think it's a gas.

58:44.642 --> 58:47.182
You know, sometimes I can't believe
they want to work with me, you know?

58:47.183 --> 58:48.724
But I just think it's really cool.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.932
But, I don't know. Anybody
that tells you that, you know,

58:50.933 --> 58:52.807
"I... I... I... I... I did this,
and I did that,"

58:52.808 --> 58:55.098
they... they're full of shit,
because it doesn't exist.

58:55.099 --> 58:58.683
99 percent of what's goin' on
is the artist in the studio.

59:00.016 --> 59:01.390
I gotta tell you somethin'.

59:01.391 --> 59:03.182
I wish that I was someone who said,

59:03.183 --> 59:05.349
"Wow, I'm doing this." You know?

59:05.350 --> 59:07.349
It would've been a lot more fun for me.

59:07.350 --> 59:10.057
But I was focused and miserable.

59:10.058 --> 59:12.474
I was working 24 hours a day.

59:12.475 --> 59:14.890
I never did anything other than work.

59:14.891 --> 59:17.182
I didn't want to do
anything other than work.

59:17.183 --> 59:20.057
I didn't feel as natural
as I felt in the '70s.

59:20.058 --> 59:21.474
When I walk into a room,

59:21.475 --> 59:23.265
I knew exactly what to do.

59:23.266 --> 59:26.516
Now all of a sudden,
I was feelin' off balance.

59:26.517 --> 59:28.890
Well, you ran out of
tape there, didn't you, Jimmy?

59:28.891 --> 59:30.724
Yeah, we want you to have, uh,

59:30.725 --> 59:32.474
30 seconds of that, uh,

59:32.475 --> 59:34.217
last ending. That's why
when I came out here,

59:34.242 --> 59:35.491
we started again, and...

59:35.767 --> 59:37.599
- Okay.
- I think we can just fix it.

59:37.600 --> 59:40.182
Okay. We got one more
and we call it a day on this song.

59:40.183 --> 59:41.516
Okay.

59:41.517 --> 59:44.682
I think Rattle & Hum
was Jimmy's last stand.

59:44.683 --> 59:46.516
I think we broke him.

59:46.517 --> 59:49.724
We did two albums, and a movie.

59:49.725 --> 59:52.474
And we went on the road
and recorded 18 shows.

59:52.475 --> 59:54.890
And those guys,
they worked like Springsteen.

59:54.891 --> 59:56.182
They just go.

59:56.183 --> 59:58.633
There was a song on
Rattle & Hum called "Hawkmoon,"

59:58.658 --> 01:00:01.807
and we did 269 takes.

01:00:01.808 --> 01:00:03.682
We actually wore the tape out.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:07.557
That's never happened.
We wore out the tape.

01:00:07.558 --> 01:00:09.057
And he's like...

01:00:27.225 --> 01:00:29.349
It's hard to be around artists.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:31.474
You can only do it
for a certain amount of time.

01:00:31.475 --> 01:00:35.973
And U2 can be very, very wearing.

01:00:35.974 --> 01:00:38.015
We... we're just... we just go too far.

01:00:38.016 --> 01:00:40.057
At that moment,

01:00:40.058 --> 01:00:42.224
I just needed to stop.

01:00:42.225 --> 01:00:44.641
I didn't want to see a studio.

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:46.015

He had a calling,

01:01:53.099 --> 01:01:56.682
just like you have a calling
to be a preacher.

01:01:56.683 --> 01:02:00.475
His calling was to be
a great businessman.

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:04.308
And that's what happened.

01:02:11.433 --> 01:02:13.182
Meantime, speaking of N.W.A.,

01:02:13.183 --> 01:02:14.807
their new album <i>Niggaz 4 Life</i>

01:02:14.808 --> 01:02:17.557
recently entered the Billboard

01:02:17.558 --> 01:02:18.682
then went to number one,

01:02:18.683 --> 01:02:21.390

And, uh, this is
the filthiest album ever

01:03:04.475 --> 01:03:06.890
in the history of the Billboard
charts to go to number one.

01:03:06.891 --> 01:03:10.224
And they call their
number one album <i>Niggaz 4 Life</i>.

01:03:10.225 --> 01:03:12.349
If you consider that
offensive, brace yourself.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.807
You may be in for a shock.

01:03:13.808 --> 01:03:16.057
So popular, it became
the best-selling album

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.724
in the whole country last week,

01:03:17.725 --> 01:03:19.932
even though MTV banned it,

01:03:19.933 --> 01:03:23.390
and most radio stations
have refused to play it.

01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:25.767
♪ NWA has one goal ♪

01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:31.891
We broke up at number one.

01:03:32.974 --> 01:03:35.557
We was plannin' to go on a tour too,

01:03:35.558 --> 01:03:36.974
and that never even happened.

01:03:38.266 --> 01:03:39.682
Outsiders.

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:42.224
Everybody had their
own little clicks around 'em,

01:03:42.225 --> 01:03:43.932
groupies or whatever
you want to call 'em,

01:03:43.933 --> 01:03:45.057
in everybody ear.

01:03:45.058 --> 01:03:46.390
Other people's tellin' people

01:03:46.391 --> 01:03:48.182
you should get this,
that, that, you know, just...

01:03:48.183 --> 01:03:49.265
Gassin' everybody up.

01:03:49.266 --> 01:03:51.390
That was just the demise of everything.

01:03:51.391 --> 01:03:53.224
Everything was just fallin' apart.

01:03:53.225 --> 01:03:56.557
This whole thing was never about money.

01:03:56.558 --> 01:03:58.973
It was always fun.

01:03:58.974 --> 01:04:01.349
Money only ruined it.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:05.390
So, after I left Ruthless Records,

01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:07.848
it was like, here I go again.

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:09.140
I'm out on my own.

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:10.557
I gotta start over.

01:04:10.558 --> 01:04:11.973
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:13.641
I don't know where I'm gonna do it,

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:16.183
and I have nothin'.

01:04:18.183 --> 01:04:20.807
Not too long after leavin' Eazy,

01:04:20.808 --> 01:04:22.390
I hooked up with D.O.C.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.015
So, I say to Dre,

01:04:24.016 --> 01:04:26.848
"Suge Knight and I are tryin'
to put together a record label.

01:04:26.849 --> 01:04:29.766
"This guy's a good guy. He can help us.

01:04:29.767 --> 01:04:32.475
We got a chance to go
do our own thing now."

01:04:35.225 --> 01:04:37.098
I remember them takin' me on a tour

01:04:37.099 --> 01:04:39.182
of the Solar Records building.

01:04:39.183 --> 01:04:42.390
On one floor, there was
these lawyers offices.

01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:44.098
And in the third floor,

01:04:44.099 --> 01:04:45.890
there was this big rehearsal hall

01:04:45.891 --> 01:04:46.973
that was all decked out.

01:04:46.974 --> 01:04:48.724
And then down the hall,

01:04:48.725 --> 01:04:52.349
I found the first love of my life.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:53.973
The SSL Board.

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:57.641
The mixin' board that I had
always dreamed of workin' on.

01:04:57.642 --> 01:04:59.016
That's how they got me.
