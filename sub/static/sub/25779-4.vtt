WEBVTT

00:35.990 --> 00:37.116
Don't touch it!

00:39.160 --> 00:40.150
It's not an it.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.286
It's a him.

00:43.620 --> 00:44.917
His portrait is on the wall.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.536
Our pal, Wallace Smith,

00:47.670 --> 00:51.834
Sovereign Protector, 1959-1962.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.178
Larry must have known him
back in the day.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.426
His mom took over for Wallace.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.598
You don't think Larry knew
about all this?

01:00.720 --> 01:03.269
If he did, he sure as hell
never told me about it.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.846
This guy was trying to make gold.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.311
And what's...

01:09.440 --> 01:11.568
What's the "True" Lodge?

01:11.690 --> 01:12.680
I don't know.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.691
Larry mentioned it once.

01:15.070 --> 01:18.483
-Well, try him again.
-I did. He's still not picking up.

01:23.410 --> 01:24.400
What?

01:28.460 --> 01:29.950
The Scout breakfast.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.797
There he is!

01:32.920 --> 01:34.251
You look terrible.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.370
Thanks.

01:35.510 --> 01:37.581
Don't worry about it.
None of us got any sleep.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.257
Blaise gave us a "supplement”
and we walked on the beach.

01:40.390 --> 01:43.348
I can't remember the last time
I stayed up until the sunrise.

01:43.470 --> 01:47.225
Last night was the craziest shit
I've ever seen.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.312
I need to show you guys something.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.448
Et in Arcadia ego.

01:58.490 --> 01:59.480
What did you say?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.940
I said,

02:01.080 --> 02:05.290
"This is the craziest shit
I've ever seen!”

02:48.790 --> 02:50.827
Right now,
100 degrees in Bakersfield,

02:50.960 --> 02:52.246
108 out in Palm Desert,

02:52.380 --> 02:53.870
78 in Santa Barbara,

02:54.000 --> 02:55.297
79 in San Diego,

02:55.420 --> 02:57.297
and 79 degrees in Long Beach.

02:57.420 --> 02:59.582
Looks like we've got
a beautiful Sunday ahead.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.132
-Now, get out there and enjoy it!
-Thanks, Kelly.

03:02.260 --> 03:05.002
We'll give it our best. Here is
Blake with a look at sports.

03:05.140 --> 03:08.474
Dated 17th July, 1962.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.090
“To my fellow Lynx,

03:11.230 --> 03:13.267
I, Wallace Smith,

03:13.400 --> 03:15.391
have completed the Magnum Opus.

03:16.190 --> 03:18.739
Like our founder,
Harwood Fritz Merrill,

03:18.860 --> 03:23.479
I have aligned the stars and built
a bridge to the True Lodge."

03:23.620 --> 03:25.019
The True Lodge?

03:25.660 --> 03:27.071
Eventually, he gets to the part

03:27.200 --> 03:30.363
where he decides to drink
a bottle of formaldehyde.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.322
And that's how he turned
into a mummy?

03:33.460 --> 03:34.495
No, that killed him.

03:34.630 --> 03:37.702
The body's preserved because he
hermetically sealed this room.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.660
We're standing in a time capsule.

03:40.130 --> 03:42.212
Finally, "I've sold my Plymouth

03:42.340 --> 03:44.342
and donated my tap-and-die set

03:44.470 --> 03:46.131
to the metal shop

03:46.260 --> 03:48.558
at Long Beach Millikan High School.

03:49.180 --> 03:52.389
I cannot use these where I'm going."

03:52.900 --> 03:54.470
A freaking mummy.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.896
Actually, it's not a mummy.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.687
It's a reliquum corpus.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.777
The body that remains

04:00.900 --> 04:02.607
after the soul moves on.

04:04.450 --> 04:05.440
Hello?

04:06.870 --> 04:08.440
-It's Scott.
-Who's up there?

04:08.580 --> 04:10.400
Shit.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.037
So, he killed himself.

04:15.170 --> 04:19.915
Yeah... No. I mean, I don't think
that's what he thought he was doing.

04:20.050 --> 04:21.255
Total nutcase.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.336
All right, I'll call it in.

04:24.470 --> 04:27.178
No, you can't!
We have to take an inventory.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.592
Everything he did in this room
he did with a purpose.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.882
This is an alchemical text.

04:33.020 --> 04:34.181
Are you kidding me?

04:34.310 --> 04:35.937
There is a procedure.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.893
LBPD, they make a report,
and then the coroner comes,

04:39.020 --> 04:40.067
and they take the body.

04:40.190 --> 04:43.148
-Shouldn't we call Larry?
-I've been trying.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.270
Hey, hey!

04:44.700 --> 04:46.816
I'm the only one qualified
to handle this.

04:46.950 --> 04:50.409
Besides, Larry said to call
only if it was an emergency.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.326
I think finding a mummy qualifies.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.077
Reliquum corpus.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.662
Mummy, corpse. Who cares?

04:56.790 --> 04:57.780
I care!

04:59.210 --> 05:00.200
I care.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.507
I found him.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.212
I was supposed to find him.

05:04.590 --> 05:07.082
You know, my oath is sealed,
my path is waiting.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.426
Let me by, man.

05:08.550 --> 05:09.711
Dud, calm down.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.181
OK. OK.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.971
-Easy. Easy.
-Close your mouth.

05:19.690 --> 05:20.680
OK. All right.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.310
-Easy.
-It's in your mouth.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.646
You're OK. All right. You're OK.

05:27.030 --> 05:28.361
-You're OK.
-No.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.118
No, you're not. No, you're not.
No, you're not. Go, go, go!

05:36.170 --> 05:37.319
Your squire lost his mind.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.918
-We've got to get this out of here.
-Hey, listen.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.911
A hundred Scouts are about to arrive.

05:44.050 --> 05:47.293
We can't have a coroner wheeling
a body out in front of them.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.330
The dude's been here since Kennedy.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.211
A few more hours makes no difference.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.808
OK. I've made a decision.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.592
Blaise, do whatever you want to do.

05:56.730 --> 05:58.550
I will take care of the breakfast.

05:58.690 --> 06:02.649
After that, this situation
will be legally processed

06:02.780 --> 06:04.600
with the utmost discretion.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.730
Now, come on,

06:05.860 --> 06:08.989
we can't have the Lodge's name
associated with this loony stuff.

06:09.490 --> 06:11.026
So, until then,

06:11.160 --> 06:13.618
not a word about the mummy.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.037
It's not a mummy!

06:41.190 --> 06:42.726
-Not here.
-Talk to me.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.484
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I didn't know what to do.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.602
-I thought I scared you off.
-What?

06:50.030 --> 06:52.988
No. Ernie, God, no.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.196
The perfect Saturday.

06:55.910 --> 06:56.900
I know.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.820
I was disappointed, too.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.122
It's not just being disappointed.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.207
It's about time.

07:05.630 --> 07:07.541
I'm running out of Saturdays,

07:07.670 --> 07:09.718
and I want to spend
the rest of them with you.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.291
Is that an ultimatum?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.250
I'm just telling you how I feel.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.630
If that's an ultimatum...

07:17.720 --> 07:18.721
SO be it.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.390
Ernie...

07:24.860 --> 07:26.680
There's a lot I want to tell you.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.901
I'm sorry.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.571
It's all too much right now.

07:36.370 --> 07:37.360
Scott...

07:38.290 --> 07:39.280
My job...

07:41.040 --> 07:42.246
I think we need a break.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.627
I got some of it in my mouth.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.210
Or him.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.586
I got Wallace in my mouth.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.801
Jesus.

07:57.930 --> 07:58.920
Connie...

08:24.120 --> 08:25.622
Hey. Hey!

08:26.380 --> 08:27.779
We got a major problem, people.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.121
There's no pancake mix.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.389
Now, last time I checked,
we had tons of boxes.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.006
Ernie, you knew the breakfast
was coming up.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.261
You are "I in charge.”

08:40.770 --> 08:42.056
Why didn't you stock up?

08:44.390 --> 08:45.391
I forgot.

08:48.020 --> 08:51.979
You... need to go to Smart and Final,

08:52.110 --> 08:53.521
right now.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.156
OK.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.611
I'll be back in a flash.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.730
Thank you.

09:01.790 --> 09:02.860
Hey. Hey!

09:03.870 --> 09:06.282
You know what we should do?
We should go get Larry.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.709
And he can tell us about
Wallace Smith, about the True Lodge--

09:09.840 --> 09:11.080
But the pancake mix.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.917
OK, good idea.
I'll stop by his house.

09:14.050 --> 09:16.007
-Yeah, OK.
-What are you doing?

09:16.510 --> 09:18.296
I'm coming with you. It's my path.

09:18.430 --> 09:21.218
Let me handle this.
You just help out here.

09:21.770 --> 09:22.760
Ernie.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.027
Stone put the gun to Pavel's head.

09:37.450 --> 09:40.158
"Tell me the truth,
you Magyar son of a bitch!"

09:55.590 --> 09:58.139
Buckle up, man.
It's gonna be a wild ride.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.790
Where is it?

10:01.140 --> 10:02.551
There's no belt on that side.

10:03.810 --> 10:05.972
What is it about the light
on Sundays?

10:07.190 --> 10:09.682
It's brighter, but... more empty.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.811
Sundays are haunted.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.367
I can't give you tables.

10:23.490 --> 10:27.074
Please, I need to work. It's not even
noon and I'm going bonkers.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.075
Why?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.123
Because I have
an incredible work ethic.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.241
I'm what America's all about, OK?

10:33.380 --> 10:34.870
So, just give me some tables.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.962
Liz, we're staffed.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.212
It would be unfair to everybody else.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.130
Fine.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.209
If I can't work...

10:46.060 --> 10:47.971
I'll enjoy
the Sunday Spirits Special.

10:55.730 --> 10:58.813
-Why are you double-clutching?
-To match the revs of the gears.

11:04.660 --> 11:05.695
Hey, can you get...

11:10.250 --> 11:11.411
Hands-free, it's the law.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.951
-Hello?
-Oh, hey.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.251
Gloria.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.042
Where are you?
You were supposed to come in today.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.831
I totally forgot. I just...

11:22.970 --> 11:25.962
-Something came up and--
-You said you were coming in today.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.171
I know.
Look, something crazy happened.

11:28.310 --> 11:30.847
OK, listen. Last night at our Lodge,

11:30.980 --> 11:33.267
we found a dead body
in a secret room.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.765
Sorry, I had to say it.

11:34.900 --> 11:35.890
What?

11:36.610 --> 11:37.429
Yeah.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.942
-I feel like you're making fun of me.
-No!

11:40.070 --> 11:41.060
No, no.

11:41.490 --> 11:42.525
You need to come in.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.618
OK, yeah. Yeah, I will. I will.
As soon as I can.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.868
I just got to... run an errand.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.070
Hello?

11:52.460 --> 11:55.703
Your relationship with your temp boss
seems a little intense.

11:56.210 --> 11:59.419
Yeah. Well, the Orbis shutdown
really screwed her up.

11:59.550 --> 12:01.757
You know,
her job is to terminate people.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.040
You know, I think she just...

12:04.590 --> 12:06.672
She just wants someone to talk to,
you know?

12:07.180 --> 12:08.887
-So does everybody.
-Yeah.

12:10.060 --> 12:10.879
Turn up there.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.050
Careful!

12:14.940 --> 12:15.930
Calm down.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.730
What?

12:29.950 --> 12:32.203
Had a lot of wild times here,
I bet, huh?

12:32.330 --> 12:34.287
No. I've only been here once.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.287
Years ago.
Larry practically lives at the Lodge.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.870
What?

12:57.190 --> 12:58.396
Who are you?

12:58.820 --> 12:59.890
I'm the occupant.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.430
Is Larry home?

13:04.360 --> 13:05.350
No.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.947
Man, Larry hasn't lived here
in a long time.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.077
I might have
a forwarding address, though.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.861
I mean, his Playboys
and National Geographics

13:16.000 --> 13:17.991
were being misdelivered here
for a while.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.041
That would be great.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.977
Pardon my... progress.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.471
Larry didn't tell you that he moved?

13:46.110 --> 13:47.100
Here it is.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.077
This is my installation.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.418
I'm showing at the Zero Gallery
in Costa Mesa.

13:59.580 --> 14:00.706
So this is art.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.790
OK.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.659
So, what are the spikes for?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.120
Oh, that's a...

14:07.260 --> 14:08.580
That's a witch's collar.

14:09.260 --> 14:12.753
It helps to push the witch out far
enough so they can't touch you.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.971
Because of the spikes.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.137
-Yeah, exactly.
-Yeah.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.596
Anyway, there you go.

14:23.690 --> 14:24.680
Is that...?

14:30.030 --> 14:31.441
Trappist, my ass.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.077
Liz. Hi.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.623
You know, I keep thinking about
the fact that, on your day off...

14:41.540 --> 14:42.871
you came into work.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.040
-Yep.
-Yeah.

14:46.510 --> 14:52.176
So, if I can, maybe I can put on my
"Mr. Insight" hat for just a minute.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.133
I feel like
maybe you're uncomfortable

14:57.270 --> 15:00.399
being alone with yourself.

15:01.190 --> 15:03.227
That's so true, Jeremy. Thank you.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.732
Have you considered therapy or...?

15:08.280 --> 15:10.772
Right, you're worried about
the stigma, aren't you?

15:10.910 --> 15:14.073
Some pathetic crybaby
who can't handle life.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.322
That's what I used to think,
anyway, but then--

15:17.450 --> 15:19.532
The stigma is I can't afford it, OK?

15:19.660 --> 15:20.661
Vodka tonic.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.087
Might want to take it easy
on that stuff.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.210
Right, it's your day off. Sorry.

15:31.340 --> 15:33.468
Sorry. I'm just nervous.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.842
The new Corporate guy
is coming today.

15:37.850 --> 15:38.976
Why are you nervous?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.721
Because he's young and good-looking

15:42.850 --> 15:47.276
and he's got some kind
of advanced degree in management.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.812
Screw that guy.
You're a good manager.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.566
Just do your thing.

15:55.030 --> 15:56.020
Thanks, Liz.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.826
I'm glad you're here.

16:02.710 --> 16:06.032
Yeah, I really feel like
you bring out the best in me.

16:20.930 --> 16:22.341
Blaise. Yeah?

16:22.480 --> 16:25.973
Ernie, Scott wants an ETA
on the pancake mix.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.475
Tell him to send someone else.

16:27.610 --> 16:29.726
We're dealing with
more important stuff.

16:29.860 --> 16:31.237
Any news on Wallace Smith?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.350
Still dead.

16:35.070 --> 16:37.653
So, I found an old minutes book.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.369
The last meeting he presided over
was July of '62,

16:41.500 --> 16:43.662
then they had
a going-away party for him.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.207
He told everybody
he was moving to Montana.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.662
I don't think anyone in the Lodge
knew what he did.

16:49.340 --> 16:50.159
OK.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.756
See you when we get back.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.637
I think someone is following us.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.210
-What?
-Yeah.

16:59.350 --> 17:00.761
Black SUV.

17:00.890 --> 17:02.130
I saw it earlier.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.300
Who would be following us? Come on.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.099
I don't know.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.607
When did they stop
making these things?

17:13.900 --> 17:15.607
Fontaine!

17:16.359 --> 17:19.113
Hey. Vance. Been a while.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.446
What's your sorry ass doing
on a Sunday?

17:22.200 --> 17:23.190
Nothing.

17:23.329 --> 17:24.616
Yeah, me, too.

17:25.000 --> 17:25.990
Hey, nice sled.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.240
Who's your chauffeur?

17:28.710 --> 17:30.621
I'm... I'm Dud. How's it going?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.003
Yeah. I'm part of Ernie's Lodge.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.791
Still doing
that Dungeons & Dragons shit?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.500
-Yeah

17:37.640 --> 17:40.849
No, there's not
a gaming component to it, is there?

17:40.970 --> 17:42.631
Me and this fool went to high school.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.760
Oh, nice!

17:44.180 --> 17:46.763
-That's great.
-I heard Connie Clark's back in town.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.470
Have you seen her?

17:49.650 --> 17:50.936
“What?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.686
Call that girl up, man.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.561
I hear she's still looking good!

17:54.690 --> 17:55.691
We got to go.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.987
-That was weird. Why did you...?
-Got to go.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.361
All right. Hey, let's hang sometime!

18:01.490 --> 18:02.480
I'll call you.

18:08.210 --> 18:11.089
So... why did you tell him
you hadn't seen Connie?

18:12.130 --> 18:14.371
-Can we just get to Larry's place?
-OK. All right.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.750
Look.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.886
-There it is.
-What?

18:20.010 --> 18:22.388
-The black SUV.
-What? No.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.512
Nothing there. I don't see anything.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.379
Shit!

18:31.310 --> 18:32.687
What? There was a...

18:33.110 --> 18:34.350
-There was a seal!
-A seal?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.733
There was a seal in the road!

18:39.160 --> 18:41.310
There was a... There was a seal!

18:41.450 --> 18:42.440
What are you doing?

18:42.990 --> 18:45.152
There was a seal.
There was a seal, right here.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.247
-It was...
-Get out of the road.

18:47.370 --> 18:48.952
You're gonna get yourself killed.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.582
-Are you OK?
-Why would he...

18:55.420 --> 18:56.967
Why would he do it? Why would he...

18:57.920 --> 18:59.502
What did he know that we don't?

18:59.630 --> 19:02.008
Maybe he swam up
the San Gabriel River.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.210
He locked himself in a room

19:04.350 --> 19:05.886
and he drank formaldehyde.

19:07.850 --> 19:08.931
When that snake bit me,

19:09.060 --> 19:11.472
there was this moment
before I passed out

19:11.600 --> 19:14.604
where I could feel the venom.

19:14.730 --> 19:16.437
I could feel the venom
going up my leg.

19:16.570 --> 19:19.813
I could feel the death inside of me.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.156
I could feel it.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.232
It wasn't like my life flashed
before my eyes or anything.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.532
All I remember is looking up...

19:28.000 --> 19:32.119
and all I could feel
was just the darkness...

19:32.790 --> 19:33.780
that was just...

19:34.500 --> 19:36.161
waiting for me down below.

19:38.130 --> 19:39.256
You know? And...

19:40.050 --> 19:41.256
I just forgot who I was.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.384
I forgot, and I was just...

19:45.680 --> 19:46.670
a thing.

19:47.470 --> 19:48.972
A thing that was gonna die.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.090
And it...

19:50.690 --> 19:52.146
And it didn't matter.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.773
I think about my dad
and if that's how he felt...

19:59.820 --> 20:00.810
at the end.

20:05.830 --> 20:09.869
There's this darkness
and it's just still waiting there.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.070
But you're here.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.201
Yeah. Yeah.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.455
That's something.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.001
Yeah.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.252
You survived for a reason.

20:23.380 --> 20:24.381
Yeah.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.479
-So that I could find the Lodge.
-Well, there's lots of reasons.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.136
Right. Yeah, but...

20:36.610 --> 20:37.896
You know, I feel that...

20:39.320 --> 20:41.732
we're connected in ways
that we don't even know yet.

20:42.820 --> 20:43.901
You know?

20:44.990 --> 20:46.731
Well, maybe.

20:49.330 --> 20:51.241
Sorry. OK. To Larry's.

20:51.370 --> 20:53.702
No rush. No rush. No rush.
We've been up all night.

20:54.290 --> 20:56.247
Let's get something to eat, recharge.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.910
-Yeah.
-Yeah. OK?

20:59.050 --> 21:00.085
Yeah, that's good.

21:00.920 --> 21:01.751
OK.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.529
You seriously did not have to drive
all the way down to see me.

21:28.030 --> 21:29.327
Heck, I don't care about you.

21:29.450 --> 21:33.614
I was just looking for an excuse
to hang out in beautiful San Diego.

21:34.330 --> 21:35.320
Right.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.071
-So, how's the paralegal game?
-It's steady.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.332
We'll never run out of lawsuits.

21:41.130 --> 21:42.507
I'm good at it, you know?

21:43.090 --> 21:45.218
-I'm the hammer of justice.
-I bet.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.331
You are on your way to the top,
sweetheart.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.000
Oh, man!

21:50.390 --> 21:51.801
-Poor guy.
-No.

21:51.930 --> 21:52.920
Birds are idiots.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.379
So, what's up?

21:55.520 --> 21:57.147
I don't know, the usual.

21:57.270 --> 21:58.340
Work, et cetera.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.767
I'm trying to take out a little loan
for the shop,

22:01.900 --> 22:04.483
just to get us through
until the summer business kicks in.

22:05.070 --> 22:06.947
-Kind of a lean time of year.
-I'm sure.

22:07.070 --> 22:09.402
-Everyone's got a tarp on their pool.
-Yeah.

22:09.530 --> 22:12.989
Of course, the banks are being extra
cautious now after the recession.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.283
I think they're
over-correcting, but...

22:16.410 --> 22:18.538
they've been giving me
the runaround, so...

22:18.670 --> 22:20.411
Well, anything I can do to help...

22:21.090 --> 22:24.503
Well, I mean, actually,
if you could co-sign the loan,

22:24.630 --> 22:26.337
that would really grease the wheels.

22:27.590 --> 22:30.890
I've been in business for 30 years.
It's a pretty safe bet, so...

22:31.390 --> 22:33.176
Just until
the summer business starts.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.135
OK. No problem.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.345
Send me over the stuff.

22:41.150 --> 22:42.140
Will do.

22:42.980 --> 22:43.811
Thank you.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.852
Hey, now for something
really important, OK?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.772
What are you watching these days?
I mean, I need a new TV show.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.427
Anybody eating?

23:15.890 --> 23:16.880
Did you get...?

23:18.390 --> 23:20.722
Hey, did you...
You guys get food yet?

23:20.850 --> 23:23.353
The pancake line's backed up,
but it's fine.

23:24.650 --> 23:25.776
This is ridiculous.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.891
-Where's Big Ben?
-It's fine, it's fine.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.522
Hey, Scott used to be a Scout.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.697
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:32.820 --> 23:34.652
Some of the best times of my life.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.653
And helped prepare me
for a career in law enforcement.

23:38.790 --> 23:40.451
A police officer!

23:40.580 --> 23:41.911
That's pretty cool, huh?

23:42.790 --> 23:45.748
Long Beach P.D.
I bet you have some crazy stories.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.041
Oh, sure.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.622
Well... actually, I'm Harbor Patrol.

23:50.970 --> 23:51.960
You know?

23:52.930 --> 23:55.342
But I am responsible for...

23:56.680 --> 23:59.923
I mean, you know, the amount
of cargo that comes through...

24:00.060 --> 24:02.301
There's some serious potential,
you know, for--

24:02.440 --> 24:05.307
-Scott's our first line of defense.
-That's... That's right.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.760
You know what? Hey.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.317
I protect Long Beach from terror.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.158
Yeah. Guys, he's not feeling it.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.863
We're gonna go. Come on, buddy.

24:16.410 --> 24:18.651
Oh, come on! Look at this.

24:22.370 --> 24:24.748
My dad started off digging pools,

24:24.880 --> 24:26.245
and then he cleaned them.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.457
Then he opened up the shop.

24:28.590 --> 24:30.126
Knowledge from the bottom up.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.330
You can't fake it.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.831
Yeah, so, you know,
once I raise enough capital...

24:34.970 --> 24:37.758
Right. So, are you going in
with your sister or something?

24:37.890 --> 24:40.803
No. No, my dad always wanted
my sister to do her own thing.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.630
She's way too smart
for the pool biz, you know?

24:43.770 --> 24:44.840
What does she do?

24:44.980 --> 24:47.187
Had a bunch of jobs.
Now she works at Shamroxx.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.355
I knew it.

24:55.030 --> 24:56.191
- I knew it!
-Ernie.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.526
You've been following me!

24:57.660 --> 24:59.697
-What?
-I'm all paid up!

24:59.830 --> 25:01.241
What do you want from me?

25:01.370 --> 25:02.826
That's you in the black SUV.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.873
I drive a scooter. It's red.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.745
Hey, how do you know Herm?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.200
He works for my bookie.

25:11.260 --> 25:15.083
No. No,
he's the sign-spinner guy for Burt.

25:17.470 --> 25:18.460
Who's Burt?

25:20.100 --> 25:21.966
This is a trip!

25:22.100 --> 25:24.091
The voice
on the other end of the phone.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.610
We've been talking to each other
for over a decade.

25:28.230 --> 25:30.221
See? Told you we were connected.

25:34.110 --> 25:36.158
So... what do you want?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.190
Nothing.

25:38.450 --> 25:40.236
Now I know my bookie. That's all.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.360
I'm gonna get that back.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.070
See...

25:46.040 --> 25:47.997
here's the thing, Burt.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.628
You're operating
a criminal enterprise.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.626
And, as I see it,

25:52.760 --> 25:54.296
you have two options.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.219
I call the police
and you go to jail.

25:58.180 --> 26:00.501
You cancel my loan...

26:01.220 --> 26:03.018
and you give me my dad's watch back.

26:05.310 --> 26:07.221
And, also, Ernie's flat-screen.

26:08.440 --> 26:09.680
This is about justice.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.681
Your loan meets the requirements

26:13.820 --> 26:17.905
of the relevant sections of
the California Finance Lenders law,

26:18.030 --> 26:19.737
Section 2200.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.282
And if you say anything
about my book...

26:22.990 --> 26:25.573
Herman will cave your face in

26:25.710 --> 26:28.919
and turn you into a worse cripple
than you already are.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.136
Scott needs help downstairs.

26:45.810 --> 26:46.800
OK.

26:47.730 --> 26:50.472
Well... we have a library now.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.601
Pretty cool.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.817
So many first editions.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.231
What the hell was he doing?

26:58.570 --> 27:02.029
I think it all has to do with
Harwood Fritz Merrill...

27:02.740 --> 27:06.449
and the legend that he's buried
in a crypt under Lodge 1 in London

27:06.580 --> 27:09.288
with the alchemical scrolls
he found in the desert.

27:09.710 --> 27:13.499
I think our guy was trying
to duplicate that.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.083
Of course. Why wouldn't he?
It's always been my plan.

27:19.470 --> 27:22.132
I know it's crazy, but also...

27:23.930 --> 27:24.920
What?

27:26.930 --> 27:29.308
I feel like the Lodge is waking up.

27:33.310 --> 27:34.641
OK, pancake time.

27:34.770 --> 27:37.398
Time to go rescue Scott.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.237
She's just gonna keep calling.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.350
Just answer it.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.822
It feels like
Larry is trying to disappear.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.746
It reminds me of Drysdale.

28:32.120 --> 28:32.951
What?

28:33.460 --> 28:34.450
My old cat.

28:36.250 --> 28:40.414
He walked out into the yard one day
and just curled up under a bush.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.120
He was looking for some place to...

28:44.720 --> 28:45.710
You know.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.342
So, you think that Larry's
getting ready to check out?

28:49.770 --> 28:52.512
I mean,
Wallace Smith did sell his Plymouth.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.971
Maybe this is something

28:54.100 --> 28:56.762
that Sovereign Protectors got to do
before they die.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.562
Is it... Is it part of the Mysteries?

28:59.690 --> 29:00.771
I hope not.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.190
What's that?

29:07.830 --> 29:10.538
-Oh, no!
-What... What's going on?

29:13.370 --> 29:16.419
-Are you out of gas?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm out of gas.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.167
-You're out of gas?
-Yeah.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.426
Does this happen often?

29:28.970 --> 29:30.347
No. No, not really.

29:33.770 --> 29:34.840
I don't get it.

29:35.350 --> 29:36.340
Is it...

29:36.810 --> 29:38.687
Is it advertising something?

29:39.270 --> 29:40.260
The future.

29:43.610 --> 29:44.600
OK.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.650
Yeah,
I was straight-edge for a long time,

29:54.790 --> 29:58.909
but when I turned 14, I decided
to embrace a Dionysian lifestyle.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.793
-What is it? _
-It's tequila and Kool-Aid.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.048
A friendship drink for joyful times.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.042
Isn't that basically
a Tequila Sunrise?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.751
No, it's bigger.

30:09.890 --> 30:10.880
And red.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.431
Thanks for coming.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.437
-See you next time.
-Bye. Thank you.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.812
-Bye.
-See you. Bye.

30:24.570 --> 30:25.890
Have you seen my son?

30:34.620 --> 30:35.951
Hey, why did you do that?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.490
What the hell?

30:49.130 --> 30:50.837
I know the Lodge could be better.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.467
But Larry's so cheap and lazy

30:53.600 --> 30:54.965
and set in his own ways.

30:55.770 --> 30:59.092
A few years ago, we really
got into it, and I almost quit.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.049
But Larry, man...

31:02.520 --> 31:04.272
He's got a little con man in him.

31:05.070 --> 31:06.231
He said something to me.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.102
He said, "Ernie, stick around.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.901
The Lodge is gonna give you a gift.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.270
I promise.”

31:12.870 --> 31:13.860
Did it?

31:13.990 --> 31:15.446
Yeah, it did.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.036
You're talking about Connie.

31:22.170 --> 31:23.535
What? No!

31:23.670 --> 31:24.660
Yeah.

31:25.750 --> 31:26.876
-Shit.
-Yeah.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.796
I've got a little feminine intuition.

31:29.970 --> 31:32.712
Listen, you can't tell anybody.

31:32.850 --> 31:33.840
Anybody.

31:33.970 --> 31:35.552
A lot of people would be hurt.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.465
It's a mess, OK?

31:38.560 --> 31:40.767
And I don't ever want
to talk about this again.

31:42.940 --> 31:44.760
Once Connie's parents found out,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.641
we tried to keep it on the down-low,

31:46.780 --> 31:47.986
but that didn't work.

31:48.110 --> 31:50.192
They made her transfer to Lakewood.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.778
I graduated
and she went off to college,

31:52.910 --> 31:56.448
and we didn't see each other
for 40 years.

31:56.830 --> 31:58.741
And then, one day,

31:58.870 --> 32:00.747
she just walks into the Lodge...

32:01.290 --> 32:02.496
with Scott.

32:07.050 --> 32:07.869
Scott!

32:52.930 --> 32:54.420
-Hey-_
-He's not coming in.

32:54.550 --> 32:55.381
Hello?

32:58.470 --> 33:00.518
That was a little unnecessary, right?

33:01.060 --> 33:04.052
You're not going over there.
Stop pretending you are.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.891
It's not fair
to keep someone's hopes up.

33:08.610 --> 33:09.975
You want anything from inside?

33:10.690 --> 33:11.896
Diet Dr Pepper.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.810
Bottle, preferably.

33:51.020 --> 33:53.352
Don't worry. If we wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.855
Stop it, Leo!

33:55.530 --> 33:58.909
Mr. Fontaine, after you left
our planning meeting at Kaplan,

33:59.030 --> 34:00.691
well, we got to talking,

34:00.830 --> 34:03.993
and we regret the curt manner we may
have used when we asked you to leave.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.169
Please accept this
with our heartfelt apology.

34:07.290 --> 34:09.748
We thought it was important
to tell you face-to-face.

34:10.250 --> 34:13.379
The relationships with the guys
who make this industry run...

34:13.510 --> 34:14.545
it's paramount.

34:15.010 --> 34:18.172
Thanks. No problem. And I'm sorry
for crashing your meeting.

34:18.679 --> 34:21.342
Let me ask you, did you see
or hear anything in the meeting

34:21.469 --> 34:22.551
that interested you?

34:23.060 --> 34:26.098
Well, it looked like
a big mixed-use deal.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.391
A little retail,
a little residential.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.262
-I just saw one of your billboards.
-Yeah.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.851
Mixed-use is a solid bet.

34:35.280 --> 34:38.022
Once you're ready to spec,
I'm the man who gets the price.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.868
Captain will be completely satisfied,

34:40.989 --> 34:42.116
guaranteed.

34:42.239 --> 34:43.786
Do you actually know Captain?

34:43.909 --> 34:44.900
Well, sure, I...

34:45.620 --> 34:47.827
Actually... no.

34:48.370 --> 34:49.917
I've never met the dude.

34:50.670 --> 34:52.797
Yeah, he's a tough guy to pin down.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.126
-OK.
-Yeah.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.659
Great. Let's head back.

34:58.220 --> 35:01.349
Thank you for your time. We love
getting to know the players in town.

35:03.260 --> 35:04.842
Oh, yeah. This is for you.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.018
There are blood orange-infused
chocolate truffles in there.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.510
You ever had that?

35:11.650 --> 35:14.779
Yeah, at Taste of Long Beach
last summer.

35:15.860 --> 35:16.850
Yeah.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.374
Prepare for an education in pain!

35:37.510 --> 35:40.081
Then you're about to get
a PhD, guera!

35:40.550 --> 35:41.961
Deus lo volt!

35:50.640 --> 35:52.096
-Yeah!
-Guys!

35:53.650 --> 35:54.640
Corporate!

36:00.820 --> 36:01.651
Rematch.

36:05.780 --> 36:10.570
Did I ever think that we would find
a reliquum corpus in our Lodge?

36:11.370 --> 36:14.249
Well, the answer to that, Melissa,

36:14.380 --> 36:15.370
is no!

36:15.500 --> 36:18.549
-Well, do you mean the mummy?
-I mean the reliquum corpus.

36:18.670 --> 36:20.160
That's why I said... I'm sorry.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.587
I'm just getting pretty tired
of people saying,

36:22.720 --> 36:24.461
"It's a mummy!"

36:25.850 --> 36:27.170
Regardless,

36:27.310 --> 36:28.926
it does raise the question...

36:29.060 --> 36:31.597
Oh, this is a nightmare.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.510
...Harwood Fritz Merrill.

36:33.650 --> 36:37.223
For those of you who are unfamiliar,
that's the founder of our order,

36:37.360 --> 36:38.566
back in 1866.

36:45.620 --> 36:50.035
So... these guys
followed you around all day.

36:50.870 --> 36:53.919
-Then they abducted you.
-I was not abducted.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.418
I got into their car
of my own free will.

36:56.540 --> 36:59.419
All right. OK.
And then they gave you a gift basket.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.619
And...

37:00.760 --> 37:03.502
And that's normal
for the plumbing industry or...?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.546
These are high-level developers.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.638
They need relationships
with guys who make the industry run.

37:10.220 --> 37:12.177
It's... It's paramount.

37:23.030 --> 37:24.395
This is Larry's place?

37:24.530 --> 37:27.443
We've driven all day, and we're
a block away from the Lodge.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.190
What?

37:42.800 --> 37:44.757
Larry owns an oil well?

37:45.510 --> 37:48.639
I've driven by this place for years
and never gave it a second thought.

37:57.730 --> 37:59.357
-It's awfully quiet.
-Yeah.

38:01.270 --> 38:02.601
You don't think that he's...?

38:03.440 --> 38:04.430
You know.

38:10.700 --> 38:11.735
Larry?

38:18.250 --> 38:19.240
Coming in.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.216
This place is great.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.830
All right.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.751
So... where next?

38:33.270 --> 38:34.260
We're done.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.592
What's the point in looking for
someone who doesn't want to be found?

38:38.730 --> 38:41.392
I want to know what Wallace Smith
meant by the True Lodge.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.980
What if it's code for...
eternal life?

38:46.450 --> 38:49.772
All I know is that dude must have
really hated his life on this side.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.072
Otherwise,
you don't drink formaldehyde.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.690
"The Magnum Opus."

38:56.660 --> 38:58.458
Why would anyone want
to live forever?

38:58.580 --> 39:00.070
I just want to live for real,

39:00.210 --> 39:01.780
for a little while, right here.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.917
People always go looking for unicorns

39:06.050 --> 39:08.337
when we've got... rhinos.

39:11.970 --> 39:13.460
Rhinos?

39:14.220 --> 39:17.633
A rhinoceros is a fascinating animal.

39:17.770 --> 39:20.592
All this beautiful stuff,
right here in front of us.

39:21.610 --> 39:22.975
Screw unicorns, man.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.560
What's the use of living forever...

39:30.530 --> 39:32.612
if you're all alone on a Sunday?

39:52.140 --> 39:53.210
Sean.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.960
You... You bailed on me.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.590
I...

40:24.000 --> 40:26.662
A local fraternal order
has given new meaning

40:26.800 --> 40:28.791
to the phrase "pyramid scheme”"

40:28.920 --> 40:32.550
after an unexpected
and gruesome find today.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.172
Members discovered
a sealed-off room and, within it,

40:35.300 --> 40:39.464
the preserved body of a man
that had been there since 1962.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.720
It's a mummy!

40:42.310 --> 40:44.938
Police have ruled out foul play,
and the results--

41:09.920 --> 41:10.910
Oh, hey.

41:15.390 --> 41:16.380
I'm back.
