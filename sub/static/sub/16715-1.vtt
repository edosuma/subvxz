00:30.799 --> 00:32.627
Shh, stop.
Be quiet.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.338
Okay, okay.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.447
- Careful.
- Oh yeah.

00:40.118 --> 00:42.115
Let's have a little fun here.

00:42.230 --> 00:45.077
He will be surprised
if he's butt naked, alright?

00:45.336 --> 00:47.801
He can asleep through
any damn thing.

00:47.906 --> 00:50.939
- Let me do that.
- No. Cobra is the artist.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.743
Keep it down.

01:02.115 --> 01:04.012
There we go.

01:05.591 --> 01:07.020
Sleep, sleep.

01:08.315 --> 01:10.355
Meow, meow.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.557
So pretty.

01:14.452 --> 01:16.494
Jesus! Shit!

01:16.601 --> 01:18.642
Suit up,
ready to go.

01:18.941 --> 01:20.581
- We're late.
- Thought you're in trouble.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.048
See you up there, dawg.

01:22.163 --> 01:23.549
We got 30 minutes.

01:23.660 --> 01:27.459
You mess with me again, I'm gonna give you
an old fashion of ass-whooping, you hear me?

01:27.575 --> 01:29.245
Alright, Cajun, it's cool.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.013
Ignorant ass nougats.

01:33.979 --> 01:35.212
Gentlemen, be seated.

01:35.322 --> 01:37.438
Commander Kerry has some last minute
details before the mission.

01:37.508 --> 01:39.396
Gentlemen, we have a pair of sections...

01:39.503 --> 01:41.576
being launched for patrol
along the coastline.

01:41.690 --> 01:45.334
Rodeo, you and Cobra will launch
as Viper 31.

01:45.449 --> 01:46.922
Patroling south...

01:47.037 --> 01:48.595
from the same coordinates.

01:48.710 --> 01:50.308
ROI standard.

01:50.423 --> 01:52.393
Keeping your feet wet
at all times.

01:52.508 --> 01:53.933
No weapons released...

01:54.048 --> 01:55.539
unless you are fire upon.

01:55.654 --> 01:58.000
All with verified authentication codes.

01:58.454 --> 01:59.993
Lieutenant Babbinaux,

02:00.103 --> 02:03.306
Are you trying to be
a mouse or a rat?

02:17.200 --> 02:20.361
Sir, I apologize for the
immaturity of my squad.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.631
Apology accepted.

02:21.894 --> 02:24.239
Nonetheless, Lieutenant Babbinaux,

02:24.349 --> 02:28.678
You might want to wash your face
before you go up on the flight deck.

02:30.909 --> 02:32.142
What did you do?

02:32.674 --> 02:35.325
Time to mount your jets,
boys.

02:36.586 --> 02:40.270
Strait of Hormuz

02:50.205 --> 02:51.940
- Hey, Rodeo.
- Yo?

02:52.085 --> 02:53.973
I will exact
my revenge.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.197
We shall see, Cajun.
We shall see.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.111
Yes, we shall indeed.

02:58.223 --> 03:00.646
All right. Roger the wakeboard,
check harness...

03:02.212 --> 03:03.795
Check harness locked.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.514
Canopy?

03:06.629 --> 03:07.597
Clear.

03:23.619 --> 03:25.430
Cobra is up and ready.

03:54.079 --> 03:57.384
Alright, Cobra, let's see if you got it.
Take the lead.

03:57.493 --> 03:58.852
Roger that, Rodeo.

03:58.967 --> 04:00.637
Cobra has the lead.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.662
What do you say fellas?

04:12.777 --> 04:14.365
Let's have a little fun.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.096
That's very impressive, Cobra.

04:19.211 --> 04:20.779
You're learning,
my boy.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.477
Am right, Rodeo.

04:25.459 --> 04:27.762
Strike, Viper 31, Cobra has the lead.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.641
Viper 31, Strike roger that.

04:29.756 --> 04:31.567
Come right to heading 1-5-9.

04:31.674 --> 04:33.791
Roger, 1-5-9, on the heavy.

04:34.168 --> 04:37.092
Viper 31, this is Warlord 2.
Tick in progress.

04:37.198 --> 04:38.959
Requesting immediate air.

04:39.073 --> 04:40.633
Meet me on Purple 11.

04:42.032 --> 04:47.750
Warlord 2, this is Viper 31-2, two F-18s,
2 by GBU-12, 2 by GBU-38...

04:47.863 --> 04:49.292
500 rounds, 20 might-might.

04:49.398 --> 04:51.972
Give me a .38 air burst
on the following grid.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.355
Wait, what?

04:54.653 --> 04:56.082
Who is that?
Is that Strike Ops?

04:56.149 --> 04:57.377
I don't know.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.885
This is Cobra, dropping down
to Carefree.

05:01.611 --> 05:04.173
Sir, Viper 31 went below radar
and a right turn.

05:04.282 --> 05:06.127
Viper 31, are you over?

05:06.238 --> 05:09.120
Confirm, 9-3-1-9.

05:09.193 --> 05:10.469
Good handshake.

05:11.034 --> 05:11.961
Zoom out,

05:12.799 --> 05:13.683
shift left...

05:13.796 --> 05:15.870
Shift left,
zoom in.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.140
That's your target.

05:17.287 --> 05:19.022
Roger that,
tally target.

05:19.167 --> 05:20.560
Wow, wow, wow. Cobra.

05:20.675 --> 05:22.391
I thought we're on
routine patrol.

05:26.801 --> 05:30.063
Warlord 2, front Cobra,
requesting authentication.

05:30.253 --> 05:31.530
Copy that, Viper.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.394
Charlie Echo-9-Alpha-1. Repeat.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.353
Charlie Echo-9-Alpha-1.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.270
Authentication code confirmed.

05:42.491 --> 05:44.762
Rodeo concurs,
authentication confirmed.

05:52.695 --> 05:57.300
Suspected chemical
weapons plant.

06:02.938 --> 06:05.208
We have a computer fail.
We can't release.

06:05.508 --> 06:07.855
Cobra, we have a weapon system failure,
it's on you.

06:07.964 --> 06:09.055
Copy that, Rodeo.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.897
Weapon system is up and ready.

06:15.829 --> 06:18.098
Target locked,
pigs away.

06:20.235 --> 06:22.067
- Get the light over here.
- Got it.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.206
There you go.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.648
Alright,
we got something here.

06:25.813 --> 06:27.848
- What do you got right there?
- What's this...

06:28.871 --> 06:30.028
What does that say?

06:30.138 --> 06:32.330
It's in Arabic, it says Rainmaker.

06:42.465 --> 06:44.056
Come on,
get out!

06:45.636 --> 06:46.716
No! No! No!

06:48.551 --> 06:49.631
Two away.

06:50.393 --> 06:52.739
Everybody out of here!
Go go go!

07:09.191 --> 07:10.270
Proceed as plan.

07:10.379 --> 07:12.191
- We are moving in.
- Go.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.563
Let's move,
hurry.

07:24.651 --> 07:28.186
As I said before,
we had no idea they were friendlies.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.389
You had no idea they were friendlies,
I understand that...

07:30.504 --> 07:32.291
but your ignorance
isn't the question here.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.932
The fact is...

07:34.047 --> 07:36.658
they were Inspectors from IAEA...

07:36.773 --> 07:39.927
a soldier and a team of civilians.
And you fired on them.

07:39.996 --> 07:41.076
Objection!

07:41.185 --> 07:42.800
I'd like to point out
that my client...

07:42.911 --> 07:44.679
surrendered the lead
before he reached the target.

07:44.791 --> 07:47.333
and he did not release
his weapons.

07:50.967 --> 07:54.045
With all due respect, Your Honor,

07:56.607 --> 07:58.451
we're in this together.

08:00.635 --> 08:02.708
I take equal responsibility.

08:05.660 --> 08:07.810
And what were your duties during this mission?

08:07.924 --> 08:11.001
I was the agent in charge of intelligence
for Operation Recovery.

08:11.237 --> 08:13.411
Can you tell us what that was?

08:13.524 --> 08:15.207
During the 80s we've heard
rumors that...

08:15.236 --> 08:16.934
Saddam was developing a weapon...

08:16.982 --> 08:19.317
and designed to take Iran down
in one fill swoop.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.697
The weapon was dubbed
Rainmaker.

08:21.810 --> 08:25.652
We'd narrowed the location of this weapon
down to a suspected chemical plant.

08:25.762 --> 08:26.876
What happened?

08:26.990 --> 08:28.724
We sent a team in.

08:28.831 --> 08:31.286
And they were destroyed by...

08:31.402 --> 08:33.135
what maybe
friendly fire.

08:33.395 --> 08:36.472
By the time we had another team in there,
the building had been raised.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.392
The bunkers below
were empty.

08:38.575 --> 08:40.921
If there ever was
a Rainmaker there...

08:42.258 --> 08:44.177
there was no trace
of it left.

08:44.866 --> 08:46.711
Warlord 2...

08:47.551 --> 08:50.324
I did a little background
check on that.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.124
and no one from Strike Operation
to the Pentagon...

08:53.229 --> 08:54.922
has ever heard of this call sign.

08:54.994 --> 08:57.460
Whoever it was, had the confirmation codes.

08:57.565 --> 08:59.605
We were ordered.

09:00.326 --> 09:02.825
Everything is on the hut tapes,
you can check there.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.473
You do have the hut tapes?

09:07.999 --> 09:09.887
Defense knows
the tapes are missing...

09:09.956 --> 09:11.761
which is very fortunate if you're
a pilot who've...

09:11.876 --> 09:14.099
failed the call for authentication codes and...

09:14.214 --> 09:17.062
can't recognize this so called
Warlord's voice.

09:17.168 --> 09:19.710
Any of these men could've
destroyed the hut tapes.

09:19.853 --> 09:21.927
Pursuing to the Article 32 hearing...

09:22.040 --> 09:25.150
Lieutenant Craig, Masters,
Babbinaux and Vasquez...

09:25.262 --> 09:26.605
have been accused...

09:26.720 --> 09:28.597
of negligent homicide.

09:29.252 --> 09:30.876
But the prosecution...

09:30.920 --> 09:32.935
it's inability
to produce Hut Tapes...

09:33.050 --> 09:35.046
has led us
to a stalemate.

09:35.161 --> 09:36.698
Excuse me, Your Honor,

09:36.809 --> 09:38.849
But the errors of these defendants...

09:38.964 --> 09:41.001
resulted in the loss
of a weapon of mass destruction...

09:41.029 --> 09:45.337
called Rainmaker, which was a rare opportunity
of immense national interest.

09:45.387 --> 09:47.788
But even more
significant than that...

09:47.934 --> 09:51.317
their errors resulted in the loss
of a life of a soldier...

09:52.001 --> 09:54.041
whose life was our
responsibility.

09:54.878 --> 09:57.256
Whether these men ever see
the light of day again...

09:57.371 --> 09:59.063
that's above my pay grade.

10:01.015 --> 10:04.504
But God help the U.S. Navy if
they're allowed to remain in it.

10:06.969 --> 10:09.529
The best thing you can do
for yourselves and for your services...

10:09.608 --> 10:11.077
is to resign your commision...

10:11.192 --> 10:14.819
turn in your wings first thing tomorrow
and receive a general discharge.

10:15.133 --> 10:18.287
I believe the Prosecutor
will agree to a full dismissal.

10:18.893 --> 10:20.723
Effected immediately.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.003
Butch.

10:39.877 --> 10:42.452
Cajun told me,
such bullshit what happened to you guys.

10:42.563 --> 10:43.795
Yeah, well...

10:44.058 --> 10:46.362
Don't let me interrupt.

10:53.918 --> 10:55.107
Tom.

10:55.836 --> 10:57.268
I know this feels like...

10:57.312 --> 11:00.176
the worst thing that
could possibly happen, but...

11:00.490 --> 11:02.037
maybe it just means...

11:02.059 --> 11:04.798
this is the beginning of
the next phase in our lives.

11:05.043 --> 11:07.268
Maybe after we got married,
we'll move to LA...

11:07.383 --> 11:10.111
and I can finally put my journalism degree
to some good use.

11:11.986 --> 11:13.984
You could be
an airline pilot.

11:18.584 --> 11:21.124
You want to make me
a glorified bus driver?

11:24.800 --> 11:26.687
Rainmaker,
Warlord...

11:26.794 --> 11:28.639
what the hell just happened to us?

11:28.866 --> 11:30.633
We can fight this...

11:30.745 --> 11:33.124
force an investigation,
get a lawyer or something.

11:33.201 --> 11:34.128
With what money?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.809
Nobody's gonna hire us...

11:35.924 --> 11:37.460
not even the goddamn
airlines.

11:37.575 --> 11:40.269
There's no silver lining
on this shit, thank you.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.532
It's over.

11:41.603 --> 11:43.340
It's only over
if we give up.

11:43.455 --> 11:44.833
He's right.

11:45.707 --> 11:47.901
He's right.
You know?

11:48.009 --> 11:51.741
You two seem to be agreeing
on a lot of things lately.

11:53.533 --> 11:57.570
Tom, I have stucked by you
through everything...

11:57.676 --> 11:59.488
and we are gonna
get through this.

12:00.592 --> 12:01.942
Stuck by me?

12:03.377 --> 12:04.830
Or stuck by him?

12:09.300 --> 12:11.112
Let me see this.

12:11.603 --> 12:12.570
You know what?

12:14.786 --> 12:16.169
She's all yours, Cobra.

12:22.824 --> 12:25.657
And now, for more news
back to you, Bill.

12:25.772 --> 12:28.028
In the news,
Sergeant Lee's widow is...

12:28.136 --> 12:30.253
still not getting answers
about her husband's death.

12:30.668 --> 12:34.237
Sergeant Lee was killed by
an apparently friendly fire.

12:34.351 --> 12:36.893
It's been described as
human error.

12:36.997 --> 12:38.916
The pilots responsible
from his death...

12:39.031 --> 12:40.795
has still not
been named.

12:40.910 --> 12:43.028
We're not getting
any answers.

12:43.481 --> 12:46.100
My son's gonna grow up
without a father.

12:47.394 --> 12:49.620
And I can't even tell him
what happened.

12:51.116 --> 12:52.788
Turn that shit off.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.796
He leaves behind a widow...

12:56.911 --> 12:58.682
and a two year old son.

13:04.772 --> 13:05.962
It's been 7 years...

13:06.077 --> 13:08.059
and Sergeant Lee's widow
said the circumstances...

13:08.103 --> 13:09.384
surrounding her husband's death...

13:09.421 --> 13:11.153
still remain a mystery.

13:13.442 --> 13:14.947
Rodeo, I'm gonna get you

13:37.764 --> 13:39.226
You're deader than disco.

13:40.181 --> 13:41.687
Ah, shit.

13:45.398 --> 13:47.821
Let's head back to the ranch.

13:55.986 --> 13:59.445
Viper Squad, Aerial Combat Training Facility
Fallon, NV.

14:05.534 --> 14:08.848
In the real world, engaged
with the L-39 is what you're more...

14:08.899 --> 14:10.276
likely to see,
so it's better...

14:10.295 --> 14:11.954
you learn from me
what it can do...

14:12.099 --> 14:13.477
rather than take a missile
up your six.

14:13.521 --> 14:15.014
Are you finished, sir?

14:15.129 --> 14:18.621
My job is to turn you into one of
the best fighter pilots in the world.

14:18.671 --> 14:20.121
No, I'm not finished.

14:20.232 --> 14:22.377
until you shoot me down,
you got that?

14:29.644 --> 14:32.817
Typically if someone says they're gonna give me
two L-39er by Tuesday...

14:32.929 --> 14:35.549
that means I'm gonna get my planes
on Tuesday.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.696
Viper Squad!

14:37.993 --> 14:39.652
Sink them deep, baby.

14:41.150 --> 14:43.601
Okay, make it happen.

14:43.901 --> 14:46.127
- Looking good.
- Alright.

14:46.279 --> 14:48.276
- Nice work, buddy.
- Thanks, buddy.

14:48.811 --> 14:51.463
Now, who wants a piece of me?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.993
- Can I go shoot his ass down?
- He's all yours.

14:56.023 --> 14:57.452
Hey, Cajun.

14:58.095 --> 14:59.677
I got something personal
I need to deal with.

14:59.821 --> 15:01.715
I need you to hold down the fort
for a few days, okay?

15:01.831 --> 15:03.647
Cool, you're okay?

15:04.118 --> 15:05.307
Yeah.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.541
I'll see you in a few.

15:14.323 --> 15:16.242
That was almost two months ago.

15:17.391 --> 15:19.464
I haven't heard a word from him since.

15:19.578 --> 15:21.652
Well, shit.

15:22.647 --> 15:25.375
He's probably just hiding out
from some chick's husband.

15:25.486 --> 15:26.991
He'll probably resurface...

15:27.106 --> 15:29.755
fired up about some
get rich quick scheme.

15:31.393 --> 15:34.198
Drag everyone back into
the Craigville.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.772
Yeah, right.

15:36.611 --> 15:39.186
Drag everyone back
except you.

15:39.718 --> 15:42.936
You know. I just can't drink
the Koolaid anymore.

15:43.584 --> 15:45.365
You know?

15:45.588 --> 15:48.315
He'll show up
eventually.

15:48.334 --> 15:49.927
This time it's different.

15:51.802 --> 15:54.454
The Feds are looking for him,
it's serious.

15:54.948 --> 15:57.714
I got a feeling it may have to do
with that Rainmaker thing.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.898
What makes you say that?

16:03.081 --> 16:04.521
My tendency towards...

16:04.636 --> 16:06.938
paranoia and conspiracy theories.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.447
Until Captain Charisma comes back,
we're short a pilot if you...

16:14.551 --> 16:16.778
want to come play with us
until your deal comes through?

16:16.892 --> 16:19.217
Thank you, but no.

16:21.926 --> 16:23.492
the money's decent.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.139
Looks like
you could use some.

16:25.254 --> 16:28.866
I am three steps from being
a millionaire.

16:28.975 --> 16:30.893
And one from being broke.

16:31.930 --> 16:33.774
Maybe.

16:34.231 --> 16:36.653
I might end up working for you.
Alright?

16:37.338 --> 16:38.875
In the meantime...

16:38.990 --> 16:40.612
Get some air freshener
in that can.

16:40.637 --> 16:42.602
- Will do.
- You stink.

16:42.786 --> 16:44.706
Alright.

16:51.572 --> 16:53.643
Ah, come on.

16:53.758 --> 16:55.511
Pull them, less throttle.

16:55.626 --> 16:57.564
My girl says the same thing.

16:57.671 --> 16:58.708
Hey guys!

17:02.313 --> 17:03.621
What are we celebrating?

17:03.732 --> 17:04.692
Here.

17:04.768 --> 17:06.916
Rich boy's money
must be for real.

17:07.372 --> 17:10.262
- You're going to Russia.
- No shit? Damn.

17:10.637 --> 17:12.449
Be a good boy, too.

17:12.555 --> 17:13.954
Leave the Russian honeys alone...

17:14.069 --> 17:15.443
learn to fly that jet.

17:15.471 --> 17:17.849
Cause this guy, he's gonna invest
in our future.

17:17.925 --> 17:19.198
We get our own MiG,

17:19.313 --> 17:20.993
we apply to fly and before you know it...

17:21.108 --> 17:23.185
- we got our own fleet.
- That's what I'm talking about.

17:23.296 --> 17:24.963
To rich boy!

17:25.752 --> 17:27.060
- Russia!
- Beginnings.

17:28.783 --> 17:30.321
God, that's good.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.600
Why am I here?

17:44.166 --> 17:46.512
We did tests.
Lots of them.

17:47.273 --> 17:49.926
My pilots only hit the target
30% of the time.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.574
So this is about
more money.

17:51.647 --> 17:54.266
We've waited centuries
for our homeland.

17:55.138 --> 17:57.179
You are the one who told us
to wait all of these years...

17:57.248 --> 17:59.212
until the Americans are gone.

17:59.741 --> 18:01.553
We're doing this
for our freedom.

18:02.311 --> 18:04.785
You and your friends at Geopetrol...

18:04.900 --> 18:07.041
You're in this
for the money.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.949
Well, Temir, I'm glad we put that
on the table...

18:11.058 --> 18:13.285
So let's put something else
on the table.

18:13.743 --> 18:15.120
If you and your people...

18:15.235 --> 18:17.364
keep doing what
you've been doing...

18:17.388 --> 18:20.116
you'll keep getting
what you got.

18:20.841 --> 18:22.303
So what do you got?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.909
No money,

18:25.444 --> 18:26.594
No homeland.

18:29.932 --> 18:31.625
And no freedom.

18:33.556 --> 18:36.692
And that's why you'll do exactly what I tell you.

18:37.451 --> 18:39.918
I'll handle your little
pilot deficit.

18:40.099 --> 18:42.325
but when I say it's time to jump,

18:43.635 --> 18:45.070
you get out the trampoline.

18:58.781 --> 19:00.349
Hey, little man.

19:02.848 --> 19:05.073
Your father teaching you
about the price of freedom?

19:05.226 --> 19:07.529
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.871
Listen to him.

19:10.367 --> 19:12.909
Most kids these days
have no idea.

19:46.504 --> 19:49.309
Excuse me...
Excuse me...

19:49.650 --> 19:52.421
Do you know the best place
to see the air show?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.069
The air show?

19:56.184 --> 19:58.151
The planes?
Air show?

20:12.207 --> 20:15.124
You got that?
I'm sorry we were late.

20:15.239 --> 20:16.312
That was my fault.

20:16.427 --> 20:18.085
It will not happen again, okay?

20:18.229 --> 20:19.845
But I think we should be okay.

20:19.956 --> 20:21.538
Hi, is this good
for both of us?

20:21.644 --> 20:24.004
This is me, this is my friend.
Is that okay?

20:24.329 --> 20:25.950
Karen?

20:27.394 --> 20:28.790
Holy shit.

20:29.048 --> 20:30.111
Butch?

20:31.321 --> 20:33.695
- Oh my God!
- Oh wow.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.185
What are you doing here?

20:48.291 --> 20:50.724
We need a better viewing angle.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.306
Come with us.

21:00.505 --> 21:02.699
I need a panoramic view and a close-up.

21:02.807 --> 21:03.997
Got it.

21:11.362 --> 21:12.791
Let's blow out the candles.

21:27.934 --> 21:29.124
I'm flying to the bridge.

21:39.788 --> 21:41.045
This guy is good.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.090
He's good.

21:42.206 --> 21:44.423
I'm interviewing him later,
do you want to meet him?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.349
Uh, no.

21:47.998 --> 21:49.537
Come on, it'll be great.

21:52.256 --> 21:54.406
There will always be war,

21:54.519 --> 21:56.525
unfortunately...

21:56.763 --> 21:59.213
it is part of our nature.

21:59.775 --> 22:02.197
We can't rise above our nature?

22:03.189 --> 22:05.034
I don't think so.

22:05.683 --> 22:06.886
So tell me...

22:07.002 --> 22:10.178
what does a warrior do...

22:10.670 --> 22:12.973
when there's no war to be fought?

22:15.773 --> 22:17.618
We do tricks.

22:17.959 --> 22:20.155
To impress the ladies,
of course.

22:20.271 --> 22:21.224
Chicks?

22:32.384 --> 22:33.846
Okay.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.570
It's about following the money
involves in an armed deals.

22:37.677 --> 22:39.649
Basically,
after the Cold War...

22:39.765 --> 22:43.711
after Perestroika, who is trafficking the arms
where it's available to them...

22:43.816 --> 22:46.238
I've interviewed ex-army officials,
ex pilots...

22:46.347 --> 22:49.195
even some of the scientists who helped
developed the weaponry.

22:49.310 --> 22:52.549
It's crazy some of these stuff
has only been just declassified.

22:56.820 --> 22:58.479
What are you thinking about?

23:02.038 --> 23:04.340
Have you talked to Tom lately?

23:05.914 --> 23:07.915
No, I have not.

23:08.142 --> 23:09.545
Why do you ask?

23:12.817 --> 23:14.705
Cajun said,
he's missing.

23:16.121 --> 23:18.788
He thinks it might had
something to do with that whole...

23:18.903 --> 23:20.525
Rainmaker mess.

23:21.449 --> 23:24.809
So maybe if you can,
I don't know...

23:24.924 --> 23:28.609
find information, or anything new...

23:28.853 --> 23:31.473
That wasn't the best time
in my life.

23:32.196 --> 23:33.664
You know?

23:34.262 --> 23:37.372
It took me a long time
to get passed it, but I did.

23:39.978 --> 23:41.517
I know you did.

23:41.632 --> 23:44.506
And I'm glad...

23:46.692 --> 23:48.331
I haven't.

23:48.849 --> 23:50.491
I can't.

23:59.044 --> 24:00.901
I'll lok into it...

24:01.016 --> 24:02.197
okay?

24:02.420 --> 24:04.646
Okay, thank you.

24:08.059 --> 24:09.413
I'm so cold.

24:11.128 --> 24:12.237
So...

24:12.352 --> 24:14.120
- When should we go flying? Soon?
- No.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.622
Are you crazy?

24:15.732 --> 24:18.459
No, let's do it,
you go it. So easy...

24:23.980 --> 24:25.366
Yeah, I don't read Russian.

24:39.133 --> 24:41.598
There it is,
there it is. One more.

24:42.739 --> 24:44.202
Okay.

25:03.584 --> 25:05.202
And this place...

25:17.534 --> 25:18.923
Try this hot soup.

25:19.038 --> 25:20.433
It's so cold outside.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.420
- I think it's borscht.
- Yes.

25:31.766 --> 25:33.601
Thank you.

25:33.716 --> 25:35.199
Thank you,
thank you.

25:37.022 --> 25:39.597
- She knows that I don't speak Russian, right?
- Right.

25:39.707 --> 25:41.824
She's just messing with me?

25:41.933 --> 25:45.086
She speaks Russian,
it's just the way it is.

25:48.185 --> 25:51.186
- I can't believe I go home tomorrow.
- I know.

25:53.556 --> 25:55.597
I think I'm going back
to the States soon, though.

25:55.704 --> 25:57.628
I'm meeting with potential investor...

25:57.743 --> 25:59.579
who's gonna see some
of my cut footage.

25:59.694 --> 26:01.429
- It's good.
- Yeah.

26:02.073 --> 26:02.980
Yeah.

26:15.921 --> 26:17.766
This was nice.

26:21.177 --> 26:22.410
That's not right.

26:22.558 --> 26:24.217
All work and no play.

26:24.323 --> 26:26.208
What about love?

26:26.663 --> 26:28.450
Such a lovely couple.

26:28.565 --> 26:30.824
And now, smile both of you.

26:33.339 --> 26:34.571
I'll take off.

26:42.507 --> 26:43.936
What did she say?

26:46.189 --> 26:47.652
Not sure.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.823
We are here to talk about the Rainmaker.

26:54.938 --> 26:58.783
Agents Davis and Cutter are from Langley
to tell us what the agency knows.

26:58.888 --> 27:02.881
We believe that Saddam shelved and burried
Rainmaker before we arrived.

27:02.992 --> 27:05.104
The project was born out of efforts to...

27:05.219 --> 27:06.969
control the environmental effects of...

27:07.084 --> 27:09.360
oil pipelines ruptures
and spills.

27:09.475 --> 27:10.938
Scientists realized that...

27:11.049 --> 27:14.737
certain micro-organisms could
biogenecally decompose petroleum.

27:14.846 --> 27:17.312
Rainmaker uses a bunker buster technology...

27:17.416 --> 27:20.831
to penetrate 300 feet below the surface
before detonates.

27:21.175 --> 27:24.100
And with the help of thorium,
which is a radioactive isotope...

27:24.132 --> 27:25.588
which acts as a catalyst...

27:25.703 --> 27:28.363
the bacteria spreads throughout
the oil fields...

27:28.478 --> 27:30.669
chemically altering
the crew.

27:30.959 --> 27:33.184
In theory, once the chain reaction starts...

27:33.260 --> 27:35.726
It'd spread throughout Iran's entire oil reserve.

27:35.830 --> 27:38.558
Rendering it useless within
6-10 months.

27:38.670 --> 27:39.697
Is it true that...

27:39.740 --> 27:41.606
the oil eventually
reconstitute...

27:41.641 --> 27:43.308
into its pure form?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.424
That's one theory
that's out there.

27:45.536 --> 27:47.582
But Saddam's weapon
of mass destruction...

27:47.617 --> 27:48.643
was a theory aswell.

27:48.759 --> 27:50.053
Forgive me for saying so, but...

27:50.096 --> 27:52.151
the whole thing sounds a bit James Bond.

27:52.556 --> 27:53.682
Perhaps.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.185
There are a lot of people in Langley
that think it'll work.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.892
Are you implying that
it could still be out there?

27:59.931 --> 28:01.543
We have reason to believe it is.

28:02.150 --> 28:03.509
Temir Ajar...

28:03.624 --> 28:06.221
a Kurdish separatist with lots of
financing.

28:06.255 --> 28:08.675
A degree in Organic Chemistry
from MIT...

28:08.790 --> 28:10.110
and a resume which includes...

28:10.144 --> 28:12.390
time spent with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan.

28:12.505 --> 28:13.815
Temir is an idealist.

28:13.925 --> 28:15.645
He believes that if he destroyed the oil...

28:15.689 --> 28:18.189
all us oil-thirsty imperialists
will go home...

28:18.298 --> 28:20.491
and he and his people can eventually
live in peace.

28:20.638 --> 28:22.296
Could this weapon to be
used against United States?

28:22.441 --> 28:23.717
Anywhere there's
an oil field.

28:23.784 --> 28:26.664
Use any other way, it would not be a weapon
of mass destruction.

28:26.776 --> 28:28.626
We believe Ajar...

28:28.741 --> 28:32.108
will exploit the device to pursue
his objectives directly.

28:32.224 --> 28:35.257
Al Qaeda would have free reign over
everything south of the no-fly zone.

28:35.369 --> 28:38.064
Leaving the Kurds free to break away
from the north.

28:38.169 --> 28:40.835
Which would encite Turks to invade the Kurds...

28:40.950 --> 28:42.648
then all bets are off.

28:42.658 --> 28:46.346
The world's third largest proven oil reserves
taken off land like that.

28:47.185 --> 28:49.989
This could pull the globe into
an economic apocalypse.

28:50.292 --> 28:51.569
What a goddamn mess.

28:51.673 --> 28:54.707
As General Powell put it,
it's like Toys R Us.

28:54.780 --> 28:56.396
You break it,
you buy it.

28:56.511 --> 28:57.817
Do we know where
this thing is?

28:57.926 --> 29:00.167
We beieve it's still in the desert
in Northern Iran, sir.

29:00.190 --> 29:02.391
Mr Secretary, we currently
have two aircraft carriers...

29:02.422 --> 29:03.951
Operating in the Indian Ocean.

29:03.988 --> 29:06.792
With two or three fighters,
we can take it out from the air.

29:06.865 --> 29:09.550
Captain, we can't fly to Iran and
start dropping bombs.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.630
The Israelis won't risk that.

29:11.737 --> 29:13.886
I understand the situation
is sensitive.

29:14.001 --> 29:15.358
But it would be clean.

29:15.402 --> 29:17.120
It'd be unmarked Sukhois...

29:17.146 --> 29:19.256
Our pilots would fly over Azerbaijan...

29:19.371 --> 29:21.564
We can't risk sending in
our soldiers.

29:22.018 --> 29:24.483
Mr. Cutter, why is this thing called Rainmaker?

29:24.676 --> 29:26.677
Sir, we scoured the Koran...

29:26.792 --> 29:28.645
the Torah and the Bible for clues...

29:29.038 --> 29:30.697
And honestly we still don't know.

29:31.264 --> 29:32.572
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

29:35.409 --> 29:36.737
Captain Webster...

29:37.506 --> 29:38.966
May I speak to you
for a minute?

29:40.470 --> 29:41.430
Yes, sir.

29:41.544 --> 29:44.622
The next time you make a suggestion,
you better have a plan.

29:44.737 --> 29:47.151
And the next time you have a plan,
it had better work.

29:47.299 --> 29:49.372
Unlike the last
two times.

29:50.483 --> 29:51.223
Yes, sir.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.964
How long is that flight?

29:59.077 --> 30:00.429
Too long, man.

30:00.534 --> 30:02.117
Good to have you back, man.

30:02.184 --> 30:04.683
I can't wait to hear all about it.

30:04.792 --> 30:07.018
Flight adversary, baby.

30:08.269 --> 30:10.783
- You sure you don't want to hang out?
- No, man.

30:11.544 --> 30:12.974
I need some sleep.

30:13.172 --> 30:15.080
The jet lag's going on.

30:15.303 --> 30:16.307
Taliho!

30:16.876 --> 30:19.418
See you bright and early
in the morning.

30:19.561 --> 30:20.605
- Sounds good.
- Russia!

30:20.631 --> 30:22.238
Get that sleep, man.

30:44.804 --> 30:46.310
What the hell?

31:02.220 --> 31:04.262
So you work for Tom Craig now?

31:04.753 --> 31:06.291
I already told you.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.438
No, I do not.

31:08.551 --> 31:10.017
You still feel like...

31:10.060 --> 31:12.237
your government
screw you over?

31:14.880 --> 31:17.106
We were ordered to fire.

31:21.018 --> 31:23.397
I killed an American soldier.

31:25.698 --> 31:27.396
And that...

31:30.081 --> 31:31.802
You tell me.

31:31.914 --> 31:34.718
Was I screwed over?

31:35.059 --> 31:37.175
But you were innocent, right?

31:37.291 --> 31:38.840
You were a victim.

31:38.883 --> 31:41.171
Just like they were...

31:41.286 --> 31:42.345
right?

31:42.540 --> 31:44.842
- And now you want to get even.
- No!

31:45.455 --> 31:46.841
I want answers!

31:47.218 --> 31:50.186
I want to know what happened and
I want to know why!

32:05.404 --> 32:06.833
What do you think?

32:12.485 --> 32:15.067
We know for sure
Tom Craig's involved.

32:16.989 --> 32:19.486
And these other guys guilty
by association?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.384
I don't know.

32:31.567 --> 32:32.724
Let him go.

32:42.385 --> 32:44.017
I know what you're thinking.

32:44.768 --> 32:46.417
But why risk it?

32:47.142 --> 32:48.904
You don't know
what I'm thinking.

33:20.441 --> 33:22.099
Can I have
one of those, please?

33:35.671 --> 33:37.482
You could go deaf in here.

33:39.699 --> 33:40.778
What?

33:49.400 --> 33:50.604
Thank you.

33:53.164 --> 33:56.164
You just received an e-mail
with a name of a scientist.

33:56.271 --> 33:59.305
The former weapons of mass destruction's
evil genius.

33:59.417 --> 34:01.152
Biological shit.

34:01.258 --> 34:03.910
He dropped out
after the Cold War.

34:04.519 --> 34:06.362
Got into the green movement...

34:06.477 --> 34:07.588
Atonement.

34:07.703 --> 34:09.208
He's a professor now.

34:09.324 --> 34:11.127
And he's connected to Rainmaker?

34:11.233 --> 34:13.167
That word came out once.

34:13.282 --> 34:14.989
In an article of his.

34:15.601 --> 34:17.449
What about Tom Craig?

34:17.908 --> 34:19.208
The American.

34:19.415 --> 34:21.130
That was interesting.

34:21.245 --> 34:23.786
A former fiance of yours,
am I right?

34:27.574 --> 34:29.190
He's been a busy boy.

34:30.184 --> 34:32.683
he likes fast things,
fast boats...

34:32.792 --> 34:36.252
fast cars, fast planes.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.594
And stocks.

34:45.260 --> 34:48.752
Naval Air Station
Fallon, NV.

35:05.745 --> 35:07.939
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

35:08.086 --> 35:10.722
I am coming back to the States tomorrow,
and I would...

35:10.837 --> 35:12.381
Really like to talk to you.

35:12.421 --> 35:14.319
- Do you miss me?
- Not at all.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.292
Just name the time and place.

35:20.209 --> 35:22.287
- Let me call you back, okay?
- Yeah.

35:27.574 --> 35:28.883
Mr. Masters.

35:30.029 --> 35:32.021
JAG Prosecutor, Captain Webster.

35:32.136 --> 35:34.135
Now counsel for the Joint Chiefs.

35:34.978 --> 35:37.248
It's a long way from
hatchet, man.

35:39.121 --> 35:40.431
You came for the event?

35:41.730 --> 35:43.268
I want to talk to you
for a minute.

35:43.878 --> 35:46.727
So let me get this straight.
You want us to fly to Iran...

35:46.794 --> 35:48.681
and take out Rainmaker.

35:48.788 --> 35:50.709
Strickly off the books.

35:51.233 --> 35:52.816
Mark your planes with
Iranian colors...

35:52.859 --> 35:54.613
so you can infiltrate
their airspace, and then...

35:54.658 --> 35:56.774
no passports or IDs.

35:57.266 --> 35:59.539
No support, I get it.
Expendable.

35:59.883 --> 36:01.706
Still, why me?

36:01.908 --> 36:03.949
You just trained in
Russian Sukhoi.

36:04.056 --> 36:07.363
and you are still a pretty good pilot,
according to Lieutenant Babbinaux.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.397
Cajun, wow, you got him involved?

36:09.504 --> 36:12.156
I thought you might be interested
in clearing your name.

36:12.266 --> 36:14.001
You trust us now?

36:14.570 --> 36:15.299
No.

36:15.413 --> 36:17.232
Which probably makes us even.

36:18.252 --> 36:22.463
We've been tracking this a Kurdish separatists,
named...

36:22.578 --> 36:26.087
Temir Ajar, ever since we knew
he bought 4 Russian fighters.

36:26.461 --> 36:29.385
We knew he had recruited these squadron of
Iraqi pilots but...

36:29.712 --> 36:32.301
but one of our Kurdish asset told us...

36:32.406 --> 36:35.787
that he recently hired an American
to lead them, and I...

36:35.902 --> 36:37.722
believed it's Tom Craig.

36:40.002 --> 36:41.192
No.

36:42.343 --> 36:43.957
Why would he do that?

36:44.452 --> 36:46.525
I imagine it's pretty good money.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.945
It better be,
because if it's true...

36:49.056 --> 36:50.747
he could lose a lot more than his citizenship.

36:50.859 --> 36:53.434
Tom put his life on the line
for our country.

36:54.005 --> 36:55.440
He was a patriot...

36:55.898 --> 36:57.513
until you guys crucify him.

37:14.141 --> 37:16.840
It's not the shit we face
that defines us.

37:17.444 --> 37:19.518
It's how we
react to it.

37:23.966 --> 37:26.006
Forward and let's sign.

38:00.759 --> 38:02.141
Are you the angel?

38:03.558 --> 38:04.483
What?

38:04.553 --> 38:07.249
The one that's always put money
in our mailbox.

38:07.929 --> 38:10.429
Mom says we have guardian angel.

38:11.190 --> 38:12.728
What do you got there?

38:12.954 --> 38:15.334
A Special Force, like my dad.

38:24.348 --> 38:26.619
He must be a very
brave man.

38:27.149 --> 38:28.960
He's pretty brave.

38:31.138 --> 38:32.252
Charlie?

38:33.939 --> 38:35.401
You want to meet my mom?

38:36.202 --> 38:38.974
No, thanks.
Gotta run.

38:48.554 --> 38:51.359
Do you really think Webster can fix our records?

38:53.279 --> 38:57.260
Expunging of adverse, commence...

38:57.375 --> 38:58.943
or contents.

38:59.058 --> 39:00.549
That's how it's put.

39:01.483 --> 39:02.596
What do we have to do?

39:03.133 --> 39:05.097
All I can say is...

39:05.583 --> 39:08.888
We'll be doing what we're trained to do
in a hostile situation.

39:10.038 --> 39:12.002
And those guys who
choose to stay...

39:12.117 --> 39:14.106
Will be fully briefed tomorrow.

39:24.079 --> 39:26.621
Webster, that same puto that
nailed our coffin.

39:27.339 --> 39:29.282
If it means to clear our name...

39:30.551 --> 39:31.828
I'm in.

39:31.943 --> 39:34.289
I get it, that's fine for you three.

39:34.398 --> 39:35.326
Hey look, guys.

39:35.396 --> 39:38.429
Some of us have history
with this thing here, so...

39:38.541 --> 39:41.804
I just don't see any point you're taking
any unnecessary risks.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.073
And let's be honest,
the money is bullshit.

39:44.188 --> 39:46.107
Wait a minute.

39:46.222 --> 39:48.059
Not if we pull it.

39:49.743 --> 39:51.249
It's not about money for me.

39:51.355 --> 39:53.089
I got kerosene in my blood.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.540
I'm a fighter pilot.

39:57.224 --> 39:58.839
Alright.

39:59.910 --> 40:01.721
Uh, Rizzo.

40:04.551 --> 40:05.478
Look man...

40:05.587 --> 40:07.890
I've lost too many friends
already, so...

40:11.226 --> 40:12.579
I'm out.

40:19.318 --> 40:21.208
I am a weekend warrior who flies cargo.

40:21.277 --> 40:24.478
I'll leave the shooting up to you and the rest
of the cowboys, this isn't for me.

40:25.881 --> 40:26.994
I'm out.

40:27.568 --> 40:28.725
You're good, man.

40:36.852 --> 40:39.638
Yeah, I'll go tomorrow.
I'll listen.

40:39.888 --> 40:41.771
Oh, sorry.

40:42.185 --> 40:43.723
You gotta be in or out.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.183
Details will follow.

40:48.092 --> 40:50.319
Oh, hell. Amanda's gonna have
a fit, Cob.

40:51.046 --> 40:52.552
Get your balls back, man.

40:53.041 --> 40:56.195
I'm in. At least we don't have to
the rich boys.

40:56.302 --> 40:58.376
Welcome to SS Dumbass.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.513
There she is.

41:06.008 --> 41:08.049
- And you live in it?
- Yes.

41:08.118 --> 41:10.496
It's ecofriendly...

41:10.611 --> 41:12.279
it's recycled...

41:12.394 --> 41:14.515
and above all...

41:15.982 --> 41:17.851
cheap, which I love.

41:17.965 --> 41:19.810
Come on,
come on.

41:20.048 --> 41:22.667
I like.
I like.

41:23.002 --> 41:24.770
Welcome to my humble abode.

41:24.998 --> 41:26.503
Oh my God!

41:33.475 --> 41:35.778
Candles, wow. Are you expecting company?

41:37.120 --> 41:39.924
Yeah, just some crazy director
who narrates my thoughts.

41:40.035 --> 41:41.770
Maybe it's her defense.

41:41.838 --> 41:43.072
From what?

41:43.187 --> 41:46.211
Well, directors don't like
rewrites, you know?

41:46.327 --> 41:48.687
You don't like it when old characters
sneak back into the script.

41:48.803 --> 41:49.894
It gets really messy.

41:50.009 --> 41:52.051
But then you're familiar with them...

41:52.085 --> 41:54.779
you know what makes them tick
and it's new again.

41:55.265 --> 41:57.038
A drama can be exciting.

41:57.153 --> 41:58.782
And dangerous.

41:59.639 --> 42:01.450
I live in Russia.

42:02.209 --> 42:03.562
I live in a plane.

42:05.584 --> 42:07.582
No, no...

42:08.807 --> 42:11.656
I did come here cause I want
to talk to you about something.

42:11.761 --> 42:12.841
Alright, shoot.

42:13.101 --> 42:15.297
I asked around about Rainmaker...

42:15.413 --> 42:16.653
and Tom.

42:17.937 --> 42:18.865
Tom.

42:18.973 --> 42:19.824
Yes.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.944
Tom's got a real dark side...

42:22.060 --> 42:23.827
you should know that.

42:24.382 --> 42:27.688
He also owns a significant amount of stock
in a company called Geopetrol.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.555
So what?

42:29.670 --> 42:32.058
He should be investing in solar
not oil?

42:32.515 --> 42:33.962
This stock...

42:34.307 --> 42:36.505
Is almost completely worthless.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.424
Its trading is only few dollars of share,
Tom...

42:39.535 --> 42:41.783
not a stock kind of guy.

42:41.898 --> 42:42.950
Okay.

42:43.065 --> 42:44.876
What about Rainmaker?

42:45.482 --> 42:49.213
I'm meeting with a scientist,
I'm gonna go back to Russia about that, but...

42:50.009 --> 42:51.820
don't get your hopes up.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.297
When do you go back?

42:59.412 --> 43:00.673
Tomorrow.

43:00.788 --> 43:03.494
St. Petersburg and then I'm actually
going to Syria.

43:03.609 --> 43:05.200
Dayr Ar Zawr.

43:05.315 --> 43:08.775
There's this show and tell airshow
they're peddling planes and old weapons and...

43:08.883 --> 43:12.767
Somehow Colonel Grachov got me
of all people, permission to film it.

43:13.717 --> 43:15.680
Wow, that's great.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.398
Is that jealousy?

43:19.509 --> 43:21.168
No, it's not.

43:21.658 --> 43:23.316
Cause if it is,
you're invited.

43:24.493 --> 43:26.154
By who?
Him?

43:26.798 --> 43:27.823
Me.

43:31.133 --> 43:35.126
If I'm in the near Syria anytime,
I will definitely pop by.

43:35.199 --> 43:37.164
Thank you for the invite.

43:38.307 --> 43:40.042
You should do that.

43:58.341 --> 43:59.637
What's that?

43:59.752 --> 44:01.671
Oh yeah, my old boots.

45:48.548 --> 45:51.167
Gentlemen, this is Anna Zhukova,

45:51.271 --> 45:53.649
she's our weapons and software specialist.

45:53.726 --> 45:56.608
This is my long-time agency partner, Agent Davis.

45:56.719 --> 45:59.523
And some of you might remember
Special Agent cutter.

45:59.634 --> 46:04.131
He's our on the ground expert in covert operations
for Middle East hot spots.

46:04.238 --> 46:05.427
Cutter, go ahead.

46:05.542 --> 46:08.810
Two days you'll be flying commercial
to Athens and Cyprus.

46:08.925 --> 46:10.864
You'll meet with the naval detachment...

46:10.979 --> 46:12.754
You'll surrender your passports...

46:12.869 --> 46:16.056
and fly in unmark transport plane
to Turkey.

46:16.169 --> 46:18.318
Five miles off the eastern border.

46:18.432 --> 46:21.456
At around 10,000 feet
you'll perform a HAHO jump.

46:21.572 --> 46:23.728
Excuse me, sir?

46:23.841 --> 46:25.728
HAHO, that's parachute term, isn't it?

46:25.836 --> 46:28.138
It's a High Altitude High Opening drop.

46:28.252 --> 46:32.088
It'll take about 45 minutes to glide the 20 miles
over the border.

46:32.203 --> 46:35.238
across the Zangezur Mountains to Azerbaijan.

46:35.350 --> 46:37.346
Excuse me, sir.

46:37.797 --> 46:40.185
I don't jump out of planes, I fly them.

46:44.368 --> 46:46.129
You've all had jump training, right?

46:46.244 --> 46:48.591
Yes, sir, but I was not very good at it.

46:48.700 --> 46:51.885
Can we just fly commercial to Azerbaijan?

46:52.421 --> 46:54.744
Technically, you're not even
in the country.

46:54.859 --> 46:57.415
You'll use GPS to guide you
to the airfield...

46:57.523 --> 46:59.639
where our contact, Mamed Zade...

46:59.748 --> 47:02.673
provides you with 3 SU-27,
painted in Iranian color...

47:02.779 --> 47:04.928
fully fueled and ready to go.

47:05.042 --> 47:06.962
You will take off
flying south...

47:07.075 --> 47:09.541
breaking Mach 1 as you cross
Iranian border.

47:09.656 --> 47:12.837
That should give you plenty of time
to hit the target, and get back...

47:12.983 --> 47:15.099
before the Iranian Air Force is alerted.

47:15.208 --> 47:17.296
All in all, from the time you get your planes...

47:17.411 --> 47:19.083
to the time
you complete your mission...

47:19.198 --> 47:21.239
should be about one hour.

47:21.385 --> 47:23.501
Can't we just send a drone in
and be done?

47:23.609 --> 47:24.537
No.

47:24.607 --> 47:26.800
I'm afraid drones are not
an option.

47:27.177 --> 47:29.600
So we only get one shot at this.

47:29.710 --> 47:32.195
- Right.
- Then we have to be pretty damn accurate.

47:32.778 --> 47:35.124
You will be. Miss Zhukova?

47:35.655 --> 47:37.194
Gentlemen.

47:40.723 --> 47:43.000
This is the latest bunker-busting weapon...

47:43.115 --> 47:45.170
the B-183M, smart bomb.

47:45.285 --> 47:48.108
It is a third generation laser-guided BVR
ammunition splat...

47:48.223 --> 47:50.065
developed by Russian.

47:50.180 --> 47:51.451
Once you drop it,

47:51.566 --> 47:52.765
target is destroyed.

47:52.881 --> 47:55.467
Sir, we've all had trainings in...

47:55.582 --> 47:57.598
the US version of smart-bombing.

47:57.713 --> 48:00.180
It's too risky with US ammunition...

48:00.284 --> 48:02.248
too much traced evidence.

48:02.363 --> 48:03.941
Tracking profile is tricky...

48:04.056 --> 48:05.770
even on the latest
NAVY stuff.

48:05.885 --> 48:07.773
That's why Ms. Zhukova is going in with you.

48:08.341 --> 48:11.068
She's one of the developers of the B-183M.

48:11.183 --> 48:13.983
She's gonna ride with Lieutenant Cruz...

48:14.094 --> 48:17.412
and she'll be responsible for
handling all the software...

48:17.527 --> 48:19.427
and weapons delivery.

48:19.542 --> 48:23.994
Critical placement is within 30 km
and about 8,000 feet.

48:24.146 --> 48:26.526
The weapon will deliver with an accuracy of...

48:26.641 --> 48:28.749
plus or minus 10 m.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.053
It's quite a toy.

48:30.207 --> 48:33.469
We're gonna airdrop it
with you guys into Azerbaijan.

48:33.736 --> 48:37.010
You should be able to load it on the SU-27
within about...

48:37.125 --> 48:38.650
20 minutes.

48:40.142 --> 48:41.147
Get in fast...

48:41.255 --> 48:43.297
- Get your load off.
- Get out faster.

48:43.442 --> 48:45.024
Amen.

48:56.177 --> 48:59.332
And these are the tasks for the next week.

49:00.129 --> 49:02.127
And do not forget about the test.

49:06.345 --> 49:08.137
Professor Dymov...

49:08.252 --> 49:09.989
I'm Karen Brooks.

49:10.104 --> 49:11.712
Ah, I know. Sit down.

49:11.827 --> 49:14.019
Leonid told me about you.

49:14.708 --> 49:18.643
So, what does a pretty girl...

49:18.757 --> 49:22.112
want to know about
such mess thing?

49:22.227 --> 49:25.413
I'm writing a memorandum on Rainmaker
for my employer.

49:26.408 --> 49:28.143
What does your employer do?

49:28.211 --> 49:32.483
He buys oil fields
in the Middle East...

49:32.598 --> 49:33.927
Mostly Iraq.

49:34.043 --> 49:36.006
Many of them were developed
by Russian.

49:36.761 --> 49:38.884
You know about...

49:38.999 --> 49:41.745
the technology, biogenetic stuff?

49:41.753 --> 49:43.029
Sorry.

49:43.856 --> 49:47.476
biogenic oil, decomposition technology?

49:47.584 --> 49:49.243
No, I don't not really.

49:50.883 --> 49:52.651
Ms. Brooks,

49:53.070 --> 49:55.111
I have been teaching for a long time.

49:55.218 --> 49:58.350
Many students have tried
to convince me...

49:58.465 --> 50:01.056
they've done their homework.

50:01.970 --> 50:04.011
If this is about money...

50:04.118 --> 50:05.278
I can assure you...

50:05.393 --> 50:08.569
we can make this worth your while,
we want to protect our investment...

50:08.684 --> 50:11.411
I have no intention of money.

50:17.545 --> 50:19.390
In the 1980s,

50:19.502 --> 50:24.183
we try to implement one of our military
technologies to clean up oil spills.

50:24.298 --> 50:27.331
We never imagined,
the Iraqis...

50:27.443 --> 50:30.596
Would turn that technology
into a weapon.

50:30.703 --> 50:32.470
Into a weapon?

50:32.583 --> 50:35.617
Did your government sell
that technology to Saddam?

50:35.883 --> 50:38.993
No, the Soviet Union
didn't allow it.

50:39.105 --> 50:41.800
Who did give them
the information?

50:42.251 --> 50:43.604
Come.

50:50.959 --> 50:52.846
Geopetrol.

50:54.949 --> 50:56.800
I see you know them?

50:59.054 --> 51:01.596
I'm glad I was here. Otherwise,
he would've frozen outside.

51:01.700 --> 51:04.046
- Who?
- Who? Your Friend!

51:09.219 --> 51:10.912
I'm going now. See you tomorrow.

51:11.862 --> 51:16.013
It's funny how your loved ones betray.

51:17.045 --> 51:18.661
It's histerical.

51:19.654 --> 51:21.728
So I get this call...

51:22.647 --> 51:25.571
It seems that my ex...

51:26.329 --> 51:28.872
has been nosing around
in my financial affairs.

51:29.245 --> 51:30.827
I was worried about you.

51:30.894 --> 51:33.044
Your friends were worried about you.

51:33.158 --> 51:35.929
Everybody's worried about
poor old Tom?

51:43.630 --> 51:46.093
My wing man, finally get
to my left door.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.700
- Go to hell!
- That's my girl.

51:51.533 --> 51:52.900
There she is.

51:53.015 --> 51:55.369
That's the girl that I remember
and admire.

51:55.484 --> 51:58.441
I always admire your spunk,
your ambition...

52:01.047 --> 52:03.666
it's that nosy thing that always got us
in trouble, remember?

52:05.191 --> 52:07.110
I like the old babushka.

52:07.799 --> 52:10.101
She reminds me a lot of your mother.

52:10.834 --> 52:13.056
I'd hate to see her
get hurt to.

52:23.719 --> 52:25.683
Leave me alone.

52:26.865 --> 52:28.981
Leave Masters alone.

52:30.925 --> 52:34.586
Cause you got no idea
who you're playing with.

52:35.689 --> 52:38.308
Or who might get hurt.

52:53.834 --> 52:54.718
Yeah?

52:54.870 --> 52:56.681
How did it go with your ex?

52:57.018 --> 52:59.397
- Where are you?
- Everywhere.

52:59.742 --> 53:01.738
Get back on the program.

53:04.844 --> 53:07.387
I'm leaving the country
tomorrow afternoon, but...

53:07.850 --> 53:10.248
I could meet you at your office
in the morning.

53:12.248 --> 53:14.395
Absolutely, St. Isaacs Square.

53:14.511 --> 53:16.314
10 o'clock.

53:16.429 --> 53:17.815
Thank you.

53:18.118 --> 53:19.929
See you tomorrow.

53:36.186 --> 53:38.489
I'm a little late.

53:58.282 --> 53:59.821
Again, no reception.

54:12.206 --> 54:13.484
Traitor!

54:35.418 --> 54:38.037
We will be late to the airport.

54:39.062 --> 54:40.372
Let's take a taxi.

54:42.937 --> 54:45.207
- We have no more time to wait.
- I think he's coming.

54:46.696 --> 54:50.002
The next plane is in another two days.

55:03.346 --> 55:05.113
Drop zone, 60 seconds.

55:05.417 --> 55:08.144
Is it true that the Russians do not allow
women to be pilots?

55:09.407 --> 55:10.684
Yes.

55:10.980 --> 55:12.213
Is that why you're here?

55:12.322 --> 55:15.050
You're looking for a few good men?
You got the wrong plumbing?

55:15.621 --> 55:19.723
Or you just want to join the mile high club
with the best pilot in the west?

55:21.376 --> 55:24.300
We got a right to know
who we're risking our lives with.

55:25.135 --> 55:27.514
I was married to the best pilot in the East.

55:27.629 --> 55:29.321
It did not work out.

55:29.624 --> 55:31.620
I'm here because they pay me.

55:31.735 --> 55:33.083
A lot.

55:35.109 --> 55:36.615
Great.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.625
God bless America!

55:52.334 --> 55:53.950
- You're alright?
- My ankle.

55:54.061 --> 55:55.250
Stop butching.

55:55.595 --> 55:57.483
It's bitching, baby.
Bitching.

55:57.590 --> 55:59.019
Don't touch my ass, man.

55:59.124 --> 56:00.401
Stupid Americans!

56:00.506 --> 56:01.880
She's not so little.

56:01.996 --> 56:03.486
Shut up!

56:07.839 --> 56:09.907
You screamed all the way down
like a little bitch.

56:10.019 --> 56:11.296
Kiss my ass, Puto.

56:11.401 --> 56:13.136
Here's our boy.

56:16.234 --> 56:17.740
You gotta be kidding me.

56:17.845 --> 56:19.733
I'm sorry I'm late.

56:21.376 --> 56:22.127
Alright.

56:24.636 --> 56:26.632
No need for such formalities.

56:35.838 --> 56:38.031
- You got our planes ready?
- Of course.

56:38.408 --> 56:40.176
They're being fueled
as we speak.

56:40.288 --> 56:41.476
Come on.

56:47.116 --> 56:48.502
Come on!

57:04.916 --> 57:06.651
- Hi!
- Hello!

57:09.021 --> 57:11.826
Welcome. Sit down, my friend
sit down.

57:13.126 --> 57:15.592
A little tea for our guests, please.

57:18.343 --> 57:19.348
Enjoy it.

57:19.720 --> 57:21.712
Actually thank you, but...

57:21.827 --> 57:25.118
We really have to
get back to work, so...

57:27.780 --> 57:28.869
put that back, Vasquez.

57:28.984 --> 57:31.535
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plan.

57:31.923 --> 57:35.002
We're going to have to
detain you for a while.

57:35.452 --> 57:37.897
Detain us?
No, that's not gonna...

57:42.320 --> 57:44.513
- What do you see?
- You gotta keep your voice down.

57:44.967 --> 57:46.473
Hey... Russian.

57:46.588 --> 57:49.388
- You want to earn that money? Get on top.
- No.

57:49.609 --> 57:52.533
You wanted to be one of the boys,
we need your help.

57:57.089 --> 57:58.170
Okay.

57:58.317 --> 58:00.052
I got a grip,
I got a good grip.

58:00.167 --> 58:01.439
Hey, hey.

58:01.695 --> 58:03.804
Watch the ass grab, dude.

58:04.340 --> 58:06.151
Now pull up your pants, man.

58:06.257 --> 58:08.407
Can somebody pull
my drawers up?

58:08.560 --> 58:10.251
Honestly?

58:10.362 --> 58:12.098
Pull my trouser up.

58:14.544 --> 58:16.279
Seriously, we need some help here.

58:17.575 --> 58:18.884
We need somebody up.

58:18.994 --> 58:20.577
Let's do it.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.892
Try this again.
Come on.

58:32.613 --> 58:35.340
Get up on top,
see if you can see anything that flies.

58:37.945 --> 58:39.484
Okay. Ready?

58:39.599 --> 58:41.273
You look good up there.

58:41.388 --> 58:42.829
There you go.

58:44.199 --> 58:45.661
Come on, keep it steady.

58:46.835 --> 58:48.434
Okay. Come on girl, let's go.

58:49.108 --> 58:51.910
Come on, there you go.

58:52.197 --> 58:53.136
Up.

58:53.252 --> 58:54.446
Step on my leg.

58:54.561 --> 58:55.895
On my leg.

59:00.827 --> 59:01.960
Come on.

59:02.075 --> 59:03.232
Come on.

59:05.835 --> 59:07.723
A little bit more.

59:12.471 --> 59:13.857
There is a God.

59:15.042 --> 59:16.277
Come on man,
are you serious?

59:16.392 --> 59:17.577
Come on.

59:28.277 --> 59:29.390
What do you see?

59:29.504 --> 59:31.850
I see a Sukhoi.

59:31.998 --> 59:34.468
A Sukhoi? Anything that can fly?

59:36.102 --> 59:37.718
A ton of biplane.

59:37.944 --> 59:39.253
And some radar.

59:39.368 --> 59:41.018
Any guards?

59:42.663 --> 59:44.960
No. No guards.

59:45.425 --> 59:47.770
We're all gonna die,
hypothermia anyway.

59:48.494 --> 59:50.535
Okay, come on down.

59:51.793 --> 59:54.293
Slowly, okay.

01:00:28.199 --> 01:00:30.086
Perhaps you have a cigarette?

01:00:31.383 --> 01:00:33.118
You can speak Russian?

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:35.652
It's so cold in here.

01:00:37.943 --> 01:00:40.868
There are so many rats, I'm afraid.

01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:43.015
Thank you.

01:00:59.004 --> 01:01:00.510
Grab the AK.

01:01:01.382 --> 01:01:03.150
I need to see it.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.088
Let's blast this bitch.

01:01:13.889 --> 01:01:15.122
You bastard!

01:01:15.232 --> 01:01:16.737
I had to kill you,
but I didn't.

01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:17.918
Close your mouth.

01:01:18.032 --> 01:01:19.615
Goddamnit,
Webster ain't picking up.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.564
Wait, stop stop.

01:01:22.866 --> 01:01:24.414
We may need him
as a hostage.

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:37.444
Quiet, be quiet.

01:01:37.558 --> 01:01:39.371
Alright, let's move.
Move.

01:01:40.243 --> 01:01:41.553
Let's go!

01:01:41.855 --> 01:01:43.851
Profile, right there.
Cover us.

01:01:45.511 --> 01:01:47.194
B, you check that.

01:01:47.302 --> 01:01:48.382
I got cover.

01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:50.107
Let's get this bird in the air.

01:01:53.095 --> 01:01:54.558
I can see the first one,
let's go.

01:01:59.732 --> 01:02:01.424
Shit! The tire is flat!

01:02:01.535 --> 01:02:03.193
What about the battery?

01:02:03.683 --> 01:02:04.720
We got power?

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:06.373
Yeah, battery's good.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.715
The goddamn battery is dead.

01:02:11.969 --> 01:02:14.163
- We got power.
- Come on, come on.

01:02:14.348 --> 01:02:15.886
There is no fuel!

01:02:16.074 --> 01:02:18.114
- This whole ops is bullshit.
- I can't get Wesbter.

01:02:20.755 --> 01:02:21.562
Shit.

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.941
Down, down!

01:02:24.054 --> 01:02:25.592
Get me armed.

01:02:25.802 --> 01:02:27.453
Let's go, let's go.

01:02:28.773 --> 01:02:30.813
- You're on, baby.
- Keep down, down!

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.223
Here they come!

01:02:40.402 --> 01:02:42.395
Put your weapons down!

01:02:45.115 --> 01:02:46.890
Put your guns down!

01:02:50.255 --> 01:02:52.482
Shoot them and save me!

01:02:52.596 --> 01:02:53.555
Get down!

01:02:58.081 --> 01:02:59.315
- Anna.
- What?

01:02:59.578 --> 01:03:01.139
What do you know about Russian biplane?

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:03.147
- My father used to fly them.
- Can you?

01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:04.572
Yes.

01:03:05.945 --> 01:03:08.249
Skids, you can make it?
Can you get there?

01:03:08.631 --> 01:03:09.635
Skids?

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:12.584
What are you talking about?
Nobody move!

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.272
Profile! On three.

01:03:15.383 --> 01:03:17.532
One, two, three...

01:03:17.684 --> 01:03:18.492
Go, go!

01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:20.335
Profile, cover!

01:03:24.015 --> 01:03:25.127
Give me a 2 o'clock.

01:03:25.242 --> 01:03:26.279
Cajun!

01:03:30.229 --> 01:03:31.506
Light them up!

01:03:34.257 --> 01:03:35.337
That's good, that's good.

01:04:15.612 --> 01:04:16.462
Move it!

01:04:16.571 --> 01:04:17.575
Come on!

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.065
You guys gotta move now!

01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:32.116
You guys gotta go,
you gotta go!

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.675
Let's go, Cajun!
Come on now!

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.501
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:46.420
Come on!

01:04:47.399 --> 01:04:48.792
Run!

01:04:50.176 --> 01:04:51.530
Come on!

01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:57.236
You gotta slow down,
he's not gonna make it!

01:04:59.767 --> 01:05:00.881
Come on!

01:05:01.608 --> 01:05:03.409
- We're getting lit up.
- What about the bomb?

01:05:03.527 --> 01:05:04.531
Forget about the bomb.

01:05:05.981 --> 01:05:07.138
Come on!

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.488
You damned assholes.

01:05:26.747 --> 01:05:29.267
- We're not gonna make it.
- They're ripping the plane to shred.

01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:31.110
We're not gonna make it.

01:05:31.225 --> 01:05:32.959
Come on, come on.

01:05:33.065 --> 01:05:34.681
- Come on!
- English, English!

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:36.177
Just a moment.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.156
NAVAL AIR STATION
FALLON, NV.

01:06:01.262 --> 01:06:02.954
Still no intel
on Masters.

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:05.906
But what intel can tell...

01:06:06.019 --> 01:06:08.594
Temir's schedule had been
moved up.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.542
Their estimation,
four hours max.

01:06:13.308 --> 01:06:16.003
Listen to this, it's from the trial
7 years ago.

01:06:16.108 --> 01:06:17.571
Prosecutor
"what happened next?"

01:06:17.681 --> 01:06:20.027
Masters
"we locked target on the building..."

01:06:20.136 --> 01:06:22.864
"Warlord 2 instructed us
to give an air-bust".

01:06:22.975 --> 01:06:25.312
"Then Lt. Craig's weapons jammed..."

01:06:25.427 --> 01:06:27.838
"and I delivered ordinance
per order".

01:06:28.154 --> 01:06:29.922
You still focus on Warlord?

01:06:30.034 --> 01:06:32.533
No, the Air Burst.

01:06:32.643 --> 01:06:35.021
Why would you want bomb to explode
before it hit the ground?

01:06:35.136 --> 01:06:36.565
To destroy the building.

01:06:36.824 --> 01:06:39.519
Exactly, but the bunker where we thought
Rainmaker was hidden...

01:06:39.624 --> 01:06:42.243
would've been four stories down.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:45.882
Warlord didn't want
to destroy it.

01:06:49.944 --> 01:06:50.795
yeah?

01:06:50.903 --> 01:06:52.977
You need to find us
a safe corridor out of here now.

01:06:53.129 --> 01:06:56.358
- Are you in the Sukhoi?
- No, nothing is as you promised.

01:06:56.466 --> 01:06:59.085
I have two soilders wounded,
and a man is dead.

01:06:59.151 --> 01:07:01.192
We can't extract you,
you know that.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.751
Rainmaker's gonna be on the move
in four hours.

01:07:03.866 --> 01:07:06.064
No! We're done with that.

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.716
Masters, you're in this!

01:07:08.972 --> 01:07:11.275
Shit! The battery is dead.

01:07:11.581 --> 01:07:12.934
Masters!

01:07:15.724 --> 01:07:17.229
Syria?

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.866
Yes. We'll fly across the border
and stay low.

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:24.359
Below radar,
let's go.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.150
You'll be okay, brother.
We'll get you blankets.

01:07:45.263 --> 01:07:47.031
We'll be okay.

01:07:47.143 --> 01:07:49.292
Skids, Skids!

01:07:50.212 --> 01:07:53.092
Profile's dead, man.

01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:25.167
REBEL CAMP NEAR THE IRANIAN BORDER

01:08:33.129 --> 01:08:34.138
Hey.

01:08:35.019 --> 01:08:37.975
I thought the black guys
were the good guys these days.

01:08:38.087 --> 01:08:40.390
No, he's busy in the
White House.

01:08:40.505 --> 01:08:42.621
He sent me
to fill in.

01:08:42.736 --> 01:08:44.274
I want my money.

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:46.399
What's your grandfather's name?

01:08:48.906 --> 01:08:50.019
What?

01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:52.638
Humor me, your grandad,
what was his name?

01:08:52.743 --> 01:08:55.165
- Edward.
- Edward.

01:08:55.274 --> 01:08:57.238
What about your great-grandfather?

01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:58.808
I don't know.

01:08:58.919 --> 01:09:01.613
You don't know? Was he a rich man
or poor man?

01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:03.645
He was a poor man.

01:09:04.404 --> 01:09:06.444
You can't remember your
great-grandfather's name...

01:09:06.514 --> 01:09:08.511
But you can remember whether
the man had money.

01:09:09.966 --> 01:09:13.078
100 years for now,
mankind might not even be here.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.913
And if they were,
all they'd remember...

01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:18.298
Would not be our name, but whether or not
we had money.

01:09:18.407 --> 01:09:21.106
The biggest decision you are
about to make right now...

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.064
Tom...

01:09:22.087 --> 01:09:24.470
is are you gonna be a rich man...

01:09:24.587 --> 01:09:26.529
or a poor man?

01:09:28.151 --> 01:09:32.069
No, I know you've been patient,
I know this is hard.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.755
But in a year when that oil
reconstitute in its pure form...

01:09:35.862 --> 01:09:38.361
Your Geopetrol's stock
will soar.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:42.279
You are this close
to quadrupling your wealth.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.881
My advice, don't cash out now.

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.636
You know...

01:09:50.133 --> 01:09:53.821
I'm sick and tired
of your bullshit.

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:59.423
I want my million in cash, right now.

01:10:01.373 --> 01:10:02.650
What?

01:10:03.712 --> 01:10:06.823
What could you possibly
threatening me with now?

01:10:06.974 --> 01:10:08.512
I know you could shoot me.

01:10:09.736 --> 01:10:14.111
But you wouldn't have anyone to fly
your little plane over there.

01:10:16.374 --> 01:10:20.134
Right here, a million dollars.

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.669
Cash.

01:10:22.204 --> 01:10:24.823
Used bills non sequential,
as requested.

01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:27.609
And...

01:10:28.648 --> 01:10:30.732
It'll be right there
waiting for you.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.896
When the job is done.

01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:35.131
Naturally.

01:10:35.976 --> 01:10:37.165
Naturally.

01:10:40.464 --> 01:10:41.741
Excuse me for a minute.

01:10:47.216 --> 01:10:49.060
- Yes.
- We have a problem.

01:10:49.326 --> 01:10:52.479
Masters and his men had to
divert to Syria.

01:10:52.932 --> 01:10:54.743
I want you to do what you can for them.

01:10:54.965 --> 01:10:55.969
Of course.

01:10:56.039 --> 01:10:58.811
The higher ups are gonna
expect the full breifing...

01:10:58.878 --> 01:11:02.491
- on what exactly went wrong.
- I'm sure they will.

01:11:22.931 --> 01:11:24.590
A bullet must have
cracked the pan.

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:26.963
If we're bleed out,
we're dead.

01:11:28.303 --> 01:11:30.037
How much farther to Dayr?

01:11:30.143 --> 01:11:31.420
Or whatever the hell...

01:11:31.525 --> 01:11:32.833
20 km!

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.526
Everybody strap in.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.248
Let's get into 5k before
the engines quit.

01:11:37.317 --> 01:11:39.860
Hopefully with a little bit of wind,
we'll glide in the rest of the way.

01:11:39.965 --> 01:11:41.001
Roger that.

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:44.262
We just change the plan.

01:11:45.488 --> 01:11:47.027
Why wake a sleeping bear?

01:11:47.177 --> 01:11:49.257
Why don't we just drop Rainmaker
and be done with it?

01:11:49.329 --> 01:11:51.128
They'd never had the chance.

01:11:51.243 --> 01:11:53.036
You kill the bear
in its sleep.

01:11:53.698 --> 01:11:56.197
Intels said the Russians
are gonna help the Americans.

01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:58.340
Tom Craig taught a lot of
these men to fly.

01:11:58.455 --> 01:12:00.954
What if he gets his loyalty confused?
You want to take that chance?

01:12:01.064 --> 01:12:02.722
I don't.

01:12:03.212 --> 01:12:05.755
This is the moment we were talking about.

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:09.666
And what about my son?

01:12:14.448 --> 01:12:16.619
Your son is gonna be here
safe with me.

01:12:16.734 --> 01:12:20.975
What's more, your boy is gonna watch
his father fight for freedom.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:24.207
What other kid would get
such a chance?

01:12:25.039 --> 01:12:27.152
You think about that.

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:36.941
Gentlemen,

01:12:37.048 --> 01:12:39.318
this weapon I have here in my hand,

01:12:39.426 --> 01:12:42.612
differs in some small things from a stinger.

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:46.185
The biggest difference is that
you can not hide from her,

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:49.468
even if one really wants. So
do not direct them at me.

01:12:50.684 --> 01:12:52.588
Close up to the General,
ask him if he cared...

01:12:52.738 --> 01:12:54.378
where these things might really be going.

01:12:54.387 --> 01:12:57.207
General, I have to ask,
in whose hands will the weapons be?

01:12:57.322 --> 01:12:59.110
My job is not to question that,

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.842
my job is to fly.

01:13:00.948 --> 01:13:03.675
Leonid, hi, it's Karen.
I can not find professor Dymov.

01:13:03.786 --> 01:13:05.369
Karen, the professor is dead.

01:13:05.484 --> 01:13:06.352
He's dead.

01:13:06.468 --> 01:13:08.431
One message from the command center for you.

01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:09.657
Go.

01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:12.467
But I think I found what he wanted to tell you.

01:13:15.175 --> 01:13:18.639
So the reason it's called Rainmaker...

01:13:19.592 --> 01:13:21.436
Rumor has it...

01:13:21.893 --> 01:13:24.972
you put the Rainmaker in a two-seater?

01:13:25.998 --> 01:13:27.155
Why is that?

01:13:28.799 --> 01:13:31.526
Well, you play American football, right?

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:33.523
I'm listening.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.248
You're like the man
with the ball...

01:13:36.165 --> 01:13:37.779
And that over there...

01:13:38.619 --> 01:13:39.957
Those are like your blockers.

01:13:43.146 --> 01:13:45.026
It's 30 minutes.
I'm coming with you.

01:13:45.141 --> 01:13:46.876
What, you're my Rizzo now?

01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:54.395
More like an insurance policy.

01:14:03.095 --> 01:14:06.172
Mayday! Mayday!
I need to speak with Colonel Grachov immediately!

01:14:06.471 --> 01:14:07.824
Cobra, this is Blackbird!

01:14:07.928 --> 01:14:10.471
- Blackbird, we are requesting clearance to land.
- That's a negative.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:14.797
AIRBASE NEAR SYRIAN BORDER.

01:14:18.769 --> 01:14:21.475
We have engine failure and
we may have to glide in.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.048
You can not land here!

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.893
You have no permission to land!

01:14:25.346 --> 01:14:27.173
We got a bogey at 3:00 clock.

01:14:29.527 --> 01:14:30.956
I got no tally on 2:00.

01:14:34.051 --> 01:14:36.519
Cobra, there's nothing I can do!

01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:41.688
USA...

01:14:57.186 --> 01:14:58.223
Step in brakes.

01:15:17.173 --> 01:15:18.678
Oh, shit.

01:15:24.743 --> 01:15:25.689
Wait, now.

01:15:25.804 --> 01:15:27.801
Friendly...

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.791
It's de ja vu all over again.

01:15:51.354 --> 01:15:52.892
Relax.

01:15:54.615 --> 01:15:55.804
Wow, wow, wow!

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:57.730
Put down the guns!

01:16:04.972 --> 01:16:06.249
Anna?

01:16:07.351 --> 01:16:08.235
Yura?

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:10.544
What? Do you know her?

01:16:10.804 --> 01:16:12.232
Yes sir, I know her.

01:16:12.645 --> 01:16:14.074
That's her ex-husband?

01:16:14.179 --> 01:16:15.838
Excuse me, may I speak?

01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:19.784
Put down your guns!

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:23.353
There is a device out there called Rainmaker.

01:16:23.885 --> 01:16:25.645
It could potentially kill
millions of people.

01:16:25.688 --> 01:16:27.227
No, no. Rainmaker destroys oil fields.

01:16:27.338 --> 01:16:29.105
Yes, but the byproduct is that
it's a mist clouds...

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:32.174
of radioactive toxins that gather
in the lower atmosphere.

01:16:32.286 --> 01:16:35.206
And then when there's enough moisture,
it comes back down and it'd kill...

01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:37.968
everything it touches.
That's why it's called Rainmaker.

01:16:41.148 --> 01:16:43.996
Webster said they were gonna launch it
in four hours, and that was...

01:16:44.179 --> 01:16:46.099
that was two hours ago.

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:48.867
- Do you understand?
- Grachov.

01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:51.246
Are those your Sukhois?

01:16:51.928 --> 01:16:54.548
What the hell
are you thinking?

01:16:56.455 --> 01:16:58.680
What the hell are you talking about?

01:16:58.795 --> 01:17:02.559
Ask him if we can borrow the planes,
they do not have to be involved.

01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:05.169
General, a lot of people will die,

01:17:05.278 --> 01:17:06.587
if this bomb is not stopped.

01:17:06.697 --> 01:17:09.350
We have tried to destroy them,
but were lured into a trap.

01:17:09.652 --> 01:17:11.037
One man has already died.

01:17:11.147 --> 01:17:14.377
Please, your planes are our last hope!

01:17:14.446 --> 01:17:16.139
Who would do that?

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:17.254
Do you hear that?

01:17:28.564 --> 01:17:30.637
We have just received invitation to participate.

01:17:30.751 --> 01:17:31.864
I understand.

01:17:38.039 --> 01:17:40.964
Hey man, you have to come out
of there immediately.

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.161
Stay down!

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.320
- What are you doing here?
- To help, what else?

01:18:06.466 --> 01:18:07.547
Thank you!

01:18:19.203 --> 01:18:20.708
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:45.251
- That ought to slow them down.
- Good.

01:18:46.249 --> 01:18:48.016
You're alright?
Okay?

01:18:48.089 --> 01:18:49.366
We got it.

01:18:53.618 --> 01:18:58.633
General, all planes are destroyed,
except for two.

01:18:58.748 --> 01:19:02.255
If we do nothing, soon the
whole base is destroyed.

01:19:02.361 --> 01:19:04.325
We need to help the Americans.

01:19:05.813 --> 01:19:07.275
Who knew we were landing here?

01:19:08.347 --> 01:19:10.461
Webster. Who else did he tell?

01:19:10.576 --> 01:19:17.063
Fly with the Americans and kill those bastards!

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:18.209
Yes, sir!

01:19:20.813 --> 01:19:22.624
Listen, Cobra,

01:19:23.306 --> 01:19:25.729
Take the fuels to Sukhoi,
go.

01:19:40.915 --> 01:19:42.104
- Okay?
- Yes!

01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:58.827
Listen man...

01:19:58.942 --> 01:20:01.029
If that's Rodeo up there
flying for them...

01:20:01.638 --> 01:20:03.638
he's better than all of us,
ain't no shame in that.

01:20:04.546 --> 01:20:06.663
Maybe I should fly with you.

01:20:07.655 --> 01:20:09.006
Good idea.

01:20:09.878 --> 01:20:12.072
Rodeo is dangerous in the sky.

01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:13.858
If anyone knows his moves...

01:20:13.974 --> 01:20:15.297
It's you two.

01:20:24.187 --> 01:20:28.530
Skids and I handle the leftovers.
With the Russia.

01:20:30.633 --> 01:20:32.061
Let's do this.

01:20:32.167 --> 01:20:33.596
Let's do it, baby.

01:20:35.659 --> 01:20:38.004
Is that true?
Tom is flying Rainmaker?

01:20:38.612 --> 01:20:40.990
- We're not sure who's up there.
- But you will be.

01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:43.564
You are better than
you realize.

01:20:43.675 --> 01:20:45.717
Tom always said about you.

01:20:45.901 --> 01:20:48.050
And it's been seven years.

01:20:49.008 --> 01:20:50.700
So come back to me.

01:20:52.269 --> 01:20:53.426
We got to bug out.

01:20:57.908 --> 01:21:00.025
Get inside one of those bunkers.

01:21:01.284 --> 01:21:03.019
Stay close to the wall.

01:21:03.134 --> 01:21:04.767
I'll see you soon.

01:21:05.504 --> 01:21:06.944
- In quick...
- Get your load off...

01:21:07.059 --> 01:21:09.304
- Get out quick.
- Amen.

01:21:23.151 --> 01:21:24.188
Clear!

01:21:28.023 --> 01:21:30.216
Asim, you see the planes? Destroy them.

01:21:30.324 --> 01:21:31.329
Ya allah!

01:21:52.613 --> 01:21:55.112
We gotta get off the ground.
He's coming for us.

01:21:55.951 --> 01:21:57.795
- Shit.
- Over there.

01:22:10.381 --> 01:22:12.372
We're good to go.
Let's go.

01:22:12.485 --> 01:22:14.397
Alright, we're out.

01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.777
I'll help you.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:31.400
- Keep your eyes open!
- Where is he?
- We gotta go, Skids.

01:22:31.515 --> 01:22:33.897
We're sitting ducks here.
Let's go, come on.

01:22:34.006 --> 01:22:35.360
Come on.

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:39.187
He's coming, you gotta get in the air.

01:22:40.911 --> 01:22:42.374
I can see him.

01:22:42.485 --> 01:22:43.913
He may start soon.

01:22:44.172 --> 01:22:45.406
Take him down now.

01:22:53.917 --> 01:22:56.840
He's on six,
we're not gonna make it.

01:22:57.873 --> 01:23:00.869
I have target,
I'm taking care of it.

01:23:08.007 --> 01:23:11.264
Yeah, Cobra...
To the moon, Cobra!

01:23:13.942 --> 01:23:15.055
You take the one on the ground.

01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.977
Ya allah!

01:23:16.051 --> 01:23:18.125
You and I will take the ones
in the air, now go!

01:23:40.105 --> 01:23:42.330
12:00 clock, coming right at us.
Two of them.

01:23:42.446 --> 01:23:44.911
Make that three, make that three.
Shit.

01:23:46.319 --> 01:23:48.666
We have target at 4:30 clock.

01:23:49.082 --> 01:23:50.467
Let's blow them
out of the sky.

01:23:51.383 --> 01:23:53.381
- Asim, fire!
- Understood!

01:23:54.414 --> 01:23:55.647
Again!

01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:56.838
Fire!

01:23:58.864 --> 01:24:01.091
We got two missiles breaking our way.
Breaking right.

01:24:02.969 --> 01:24:04.355
Breaking left!

01:24:13.825 --> 01:24:16.707
- Skids, you got a heat on your 6:00.
- Copy that.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.345
He's still tracking us.
Flares.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:26.414
I can't find them.

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:29.101
- Get him away from us.
- I'm trying.

01:24:31.971 --> 01:24:33.858
Skids, get that shit off our ass.

01:24:39.516 --> 01:24:41.106
What are you doing?

01:24:42.471 --> 01:24:43.487
What are you doing, man?

01:24:43.634 --> 01:24:45.171
Hang on, Vasquez.

01:24:46.975 --> 01:24:48.935
- Skids, pull up!
- Not yet!

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:50.276
Pull up, man.

01:24:50.846 --> 01:24:52.427
Pull up!
Pull up!

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:55.403
Hang on, Vasquez!

01:25:03.645 --> 01:25:05.356
Skidmore's in the house.

01:25:05.538 --> 01:25:06.892
Let's go back and
join the fight.

01:25:12.175 --> 01:25:14.249
- Everything okay, skids?
- I can not see!

01:25:14.784 --> 01:25:15.711
I got you.

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:18.624
Consider that a warning,
I could've blown your assout of the sky.

01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:21.083
Rodeo, what the hell are you doing, man?

01:25:21.198 --> 01:25:22.695
What the hell are you doing
is the question.

01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:25.955
Fly do west as far as you can
before ejecting.

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:28.943
With any luck, you'll end up in Syria.
The rest of you, turn back now.

01:25:29.054 --> 01:25:31.394
That's not gonna happen, Tom.
We're not turning back.

01:25:31.509 --> 01:25:34.510
Judas, first after my girl
now me?

01:25:34.766 --> 01:25:37.422
That's bullshit. You're the traitor, Tom, not me.

01:25:37.537 --> 01:25:40.413
You and your friend Warlord
that screwed everybody over.

01:25:40.529 --> 01:25:42.259
Weapons' malfunction
forced my hand.

01:25:42.366 --> 01:25:44.207
You all weren't supposed
to be involved.

01:25:44.323 --> 01:25:46.668
But we were, and you
left your squad...

01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:47.819
and we were left with nothing.

01:25:47.929 --> 01:25:51.159
And I carried you all, didn't I?
You all wouldn't be shit without me.

01:25:51.416 --> 01:25:54.224
- Bullshit.
- Now, get out of my airspace.

01:25:54.339 --> 01:25:56.064
This Rainmaker thing is bad news, man.

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:58.140
If you stayed back at the ranch
like I told you...

01:25:58.248 --> 01:26:00.168
you wouldn't find yourselves
in this perdicament.

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:05.892
Holy shit, they got us
in roll of scissors.

01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:17.245
They are right behind me.

01:26:19.271 --> 01:26:21.115
I have a target.

01:26:22.798 --> 01:26:25.644
- Use the flares.
- I can not see them.

01:26:29.168 --> 01:26:30.860
See that right there?
That's him.

01:26:30.971 --> 01:26:33.775
Your father's in that plane.
It's better than video games.

01:26:33.887 --> 01:26:35.502
You gotta get us out of here, Cobra!

01:26:35.613 --> 01:26:37.042
I'm trying!

01:26:39.258 --> 01:26:40.992
Viper, where the hell are you, man?

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.217
We're on our way.

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:45.211
Anna, is Grachov with you?

01:26:45.357 --> 01:26:46.786
I'm here, Cobra!

01:26:49.155 --> 01:26:51.196
Rodeo, you got company at 6:00 clock.

01:26:51.381 --> 01:26:52.995
Break out, break out!

01:26:53.797 --> 01:26:55.303
I see a target in front of us.

01:26:55.409 --> 01:26:56.837
- Tell me.
- Confirm target.

01:26:57.288 --> 01:26:59.438
- What should I do?
- Get the target system on.

01:26:59.552 --> 01:27:01.166
- Target system is turned on.
- Confirm.

01:27:01.585 --> 01:27:02.894
We have it on the right.

01:27:05.114 --> 01:27:06.620
He's trying to escape.

01:27:06.725 --> 01:27:08.307
Shall I fire?

01:27:08.413 --> 01:27:10.333
- No, you have to wait!
- I'm waiting.

01:27:10.447 --> 01:27:12.912
- Now?
- Yes, now!

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.288
Fire!

01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:21.349
- We did it!
- Yes!

01:27:21.418 --> 01:27:23.458
- That was wonderful!
- There's another one!

01:27:23.566 --> 01:27:25.029
We have to move!

01:27:30.701 --> 01:27:32.589
Yura!

01:27:34.342 --> 01:27:36.812
Anna, he's coming down
behind you.

01:27:37.492 --> 01:27:38.997
Yura, what about you?

01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:46.319
Anna, you guys gotta punch out!

01:27:46.774 --> 01:27:49.610
You gotta punch out!
Punch out!

01:27:50.573 --> 01:27:52.265
What are you doing?
Finish them off.

01:27:52.377 --> 01:27:53.490
They're already done.

01:27:53.604 --> 01:27:55.416
Anna, punch out!

01:28:00.701 --> 01:28:02.087
What happened?
What just happene?

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:04.385
Russians bailed, we got bogey 4:00.

01:28:04.998 --> 01:28:07.420
Asim, you have to shoot him! Asim!

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.954
- Bring us to our right!
- I'm breaking right.

01:28:19.576 --> 01:28:22.075
- He wants to play chicken.
- Alright, let's play.

01:28:24.947 --> 01:28:26.834
They're on to me.

01:28:26.903 --> 01:28:29.325
Do not dodge, do not move!

01:28:30.854 --> 01:28:31.934
You're getting closer!

01:28:35.803 --> 01:28:37.036
There they are!

01:28:47.734 --> 01:28:49.239
Shit my pants!

01:28:52.069 --> 01:28:54.611
I taught you everything you know,
not everything I know.

01:28:56.979 --> 01:28:58.059
Are you hit?

01:28:58.168 --> 01:29:00.667
A scratch. My arm,
just a scratch.

01:29:00.930 --> 01:29:02.359
Going up.

01:29:06.033 --> 01:29:07.113
Hey, Rodeo,

01:29:07.184 --> 01:29:09.835
You know how many people
this Rainmaker's gonna kill?

01:29:09.946 --> 01:29:12.520
The oil fields it lands on,
it works underground.

01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:13.984
No, you're wrong, Tom.

01:29:14.089 --> 01:29:16.008
The toxic rain is gonna kill
millions.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.513
They're using you man.

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.309
Is he telling the truth?

01:29:20.303 --> 01:29:22.606
They're not your people,
it's not your concern.

01:29:23.564 --> 01:29:24.993
I'm making it my concern.

01:29:26.518 --> 01:29:28.515
This is not a negotiation!

01:29:29.088 --> 01:29:30.125
Do your job!

01:29:30.393 --> 01:29:31.931
You got the wrong guy.

01:29:32.809 --> 01:29:34.392
There's no bailing out this time.

01:29:34.765 --> 01:29:36.610
I've prepared my whole life
for this.

01:29:39.599 --> 01:29:41.062
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

01:29:42.017 --> 01:29:43.784
I climb to 12,000 feet.

01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:46.508
15,000 feet.

01:29:48.845 --> 01:29:50.460
20,000 feet.

01:29:56.402 --> 01:29:59.054
We should pull it man,
we're gonna stall.

01:29:59.855 --> 01:30:00.815
We can't do that, man.

01:30:00.929 --> 01:30:03.701
25,000 feet.
They're still with us.

01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:09.948
Hold on, Cajun.

01:30:26.133 --> 01:30:27.901
What the hell
did you do?

01:30:29.972 --> 01:30:32.742
Nice move, Cobra.
Something I didn't teach you.

01:30:36.146 --> 01:30:38.033
Give it up, Tom.
It's over.

01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:40.298
The Rainmaker is disarmed.

01:30:43.055 --> 01:30:45.550
Are you crazy?
You're gonna kill us both.

01:30:46.273 --> 01:30:49.230
Cajun, write this down,
coordinates...

01:30:49.381 --> 01:30:52.457
30 Left, 60 Right, 1-9-64.

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.832
- Copy that.
- What's that?

01:30:54.905 --> 01:30:58.746
Where you'll find Warlord,
but you better hurry, he's listening.

01:31:00.352 --> 01:31:03.048
Tom, are you crazy?
Pull up Tom!

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.304
I'm giving you the chance to punch out, man.

01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:08.722
Pull it up.
Temir, your son is watching.

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:11.754
Pull this plane up!
I said, pull this plane up!

01:31:11.823 --> 01:31:13.405
Your son is watching you.

01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:15.279
There's nothing I can do.

01:31:15.391 --> 01:31:18.501
Get out, Rodeo!
Get out, Rodeo!

01:31:18.613 --> 01:31:20.195
Rodeo, what are you doing man?

01:31:20.876 --> 01:31:23.527
Rodeo, you gotta get out of there.
You gotta punch out.

01:31:24.099 --> 01:31:25.452
Be good to her.

01:31:25.749 --> 01:31:27.547
Punch out, Tom!

01:31:27.662 --> 01:31:29.874
Damn it, punch out!

01:31:31.234 --> 01:31:33.231
Latik!

01:31:33.306 --> 01:31:36.544
My son, we'll meet again. I promise you that.

01:31:36.748 --> 01:31:39.769
Latik! Allahu akbar!

01:31:40.902 --> 01:31:42.517
Shit.

01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:43.937
Jesus, Tom.

01:31:48.344 --> 01:31:49.730
Give me the coordinates.

01:31:51.144 --> 01:31:53.337
We are in Iran.
This is no good.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.520
Give me the coordinates.

01:32:04.994 --> 01:32:08.147
Okay, there's Warlord, 1:00 on clock below us.

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:10.674
We got two missiles remaining.

01:32:14.622 --> 01:32:15.976
Hold on, hold on.

01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.000
Something's not right, here.

01:32:19.456 --> 01:32:20.995
- It's a trap.
- Pull up!

01:32:42.589 --> 01:32:45.589
Don't worry, just gonna cut you lose.

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:47.816
You did a good job.

01:32:47.921 --> 01:32:49.918
Put your hand up.

01:32:54.968 --> 01:32:56.786
Good, listen.

01:32:56.897 --> 01:32:58.710
I lost my father when I was your age.

01:32:58.816 --> 01:33:01.468
Look at me. If it don't kill you,
it'll make you tougher.

01:33:01.578 --> 01:33:03.575
Take this, alright?
You got it?

01:33:03.727 --> 01:33:05.367
Go on right up there,
they'll come to you.

01:33:05.474 --> 01:33:07.992
Right up there at the top
of the mountain, go.

01:33:08.099 --> 01:33:08.950
Keep on running!

01:33:28.909 --> 01:33:30.141
God...

01:33:31.577 --> 01:33:34.197
The same freaking ankle.

01:33:42.933 --> 01:33:45.661
No passport,
no ID.

01:33:45.969 --> 01:33:47.077
Shit.

01:33:51.602 --> 01:33:52.639
Oh, shit.

01:33:53.598 --> 01:33:55.409
For a job well done?

01:33:59.354 --> 01:34:01.045
He's got a plan
for everything, right?

01:34:01.155 --> 01:34:04.156
If we didn't interfere,
Rodeo would've come back for his money.

01:34:04.646 --> 01:34:06.686
They would've had a plan
a way out.

01:34:09.288 --> 01:34:12.060
Why don't you finish me off, huh Cobra?

01:34:13.278 --> 01:34:15.318
I thought you were good
at killing your own people.

01:34:15.712 --> 01:34:17.964
We're about 17 miles from the Iraqi border.

01:34:18.264 --> 01:34:22.105
I'm thinking someone's expecting
two Americans to cross it soon.

01:34:24.134 --> 01:34:25.639
Let's not disappoint.

01:34:50.145 --> 01:34:51.026
Good morning.

01:34:52.062 --> 01:34:54.135
These are long overdue.

01:34:54.916 --> 01:34:56.560
Your mission is acomplished.

01:34:56.675 --> 01:34:58.782
You stopped Rainmaker and
neutralized Warlord.

01:34:59.965 --> 01:35:01.776
We're very grateful.

01:35:02.305 --> 01:35:04.804
The reality is, that you've all been
away from the stick too long...

01:35:04.913 --> 01:35:06.529
To get you back on the carrier.

01:35:06.819 --> 01:35:11.180
But your discharges will be converted
from "general" to "honorable".

01:35:11.474 --> 01:35:15.118
And we'll put you in fleet reserve as
Lieutenant Commanders.

01:35:16.153 --> 01:35:19.417
But there is one place
where we can use you.

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.266
Mr. Craig has left us without a contractor
to fly advesaries...

01:35:24.286 --> 01:35:26.174
if you are interested,

01:35:27.394 --> 01:35:30.568
we've got some impounded MiGs
that we can sell to you for a buck a piece.

01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:33.769
Yeah, yeah...

01:35:34.223 --> 01:35:36.066
Shit, we got some coins.

01:35:36.179 --> 01:35:38.907
- What about the money from the jeep?
- Looks like it's going to the widow, like you asked.

01:35:39.018 --> 01:35:41.440
Yura is out of his coma, he wants to talk to you.

01:35:45.018 --> 01:35:47.960
Blackbird, are you okay?

01:35:48.378 --> 01:35:50.605
No! I'm not okay!

01:35:51.255 --> 01:35:53.678
The General wants his money,
and he wants it now!

01:35:55.053 --> 01:35:58.010
Excuse me, he wants to talk to you.

01:36:00.194 --> 01:36:01.274
Ye?

01:36:01.383 --> 01:36:03.576
My planes are destroyed!

01:36:03.685 --> 01:36:05.802
I need that money right away!

01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:07.602
I don't understand,
what does he want?

01:36:07.713 --> 01:36:10.016
Reimbursement,
for his planes.

01:36:12.278 --> 01:36:13.707
You speak Russian.

01:36:13.822 --> 01:36:15.924
Mandarin and Armenian, no Russian.

01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:25.329
It's not the shit we face
that defines us...

01:36:26.779 --> 01:36:29.413
- it's how we deal with it.
- Exactly.

01:36:32.956 --> 01:36:33.882
Yes.

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:35.688
What is the problem?

01:36:35.794 --> 01:36:37.835
I need money right away.

01:36:37.942 --> 01:36:39.983
Is your government out of
money again?

01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:41.134
No.

01:36:41.242 --> 01:36:44.199
- I need that money right away.
- Of course.

01:36:46.075 --> 01:36:47.920
Yes, I know.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.310
Hello ma'am.

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.384
My name is Butch Masters,

01:37:34.105 --> 01:37:37.411
and I'd like to talk to you about your husband
if I could.

01:37:56.509 --> 01:37:59.051
- I was gonna leave without you.
- There's no turning back now.

01:37:59.155 --> 01:38:01.153
- I'm doing it.
- You're doing it.

01:38:02.033 --> 01:38:03.266
I can do this!

01:38:04.028 --> 01:38:06.287
So, watch...

01:38:06.402 --> 01:38:09.315
Watch your fingers
when you shut the canopy.

01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:11.253
Okay.

01:38:14.614 --> 01:38:16.204
Okay.

01:38:24.168 --> 01:38:26.743
Do you see the joystick
between your leg?

01:38:26.892 --> 01:38:28.245
Yes, I do...

01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:30.466
I'm sorry. I don't know where my mind went
just then.

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:33.918
Now gently pull it towards you.

01:38:34.034 --> 01:38:35.293
Okay.

01:38:40.812 --> 01:38:43.317
Oh my God, I'm flying this plane.

01:38:43.541 --> 01:38:45.309
alright, now whack it.

01:38:45.421 --> 01:38:46.730
Is that a real term?

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.797
Yes, it is.
Slam it at your knee, fast.

01:38:49.909 --> 01:38:51.066
Okay.

01:39:16.004 --> 01:39:17.347
