WEBVTT

00:45.003 --> 00:46.504
I want everything.

01:04.939 --> 01:08.234
How did that son of a bitch
get the file?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.236
I don't know.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.030
He just gave me the copies.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.451
Which you were going to publish.

01:55.281 --> 01:59.619
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

01:59.702 --> 02:03.957
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

02:04.040 --> 02:08.294
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:08.378 --> 02:13.591
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:15.468 --> 02:19.347
Even when the clouds drift away

02:19.430 --> 02:23.393
Even when my skin dries away

02:23.476 --> 02:27.480
I'll be back someday

02:28.481 --> 02:32.527
To unleash my return

02:36.531 --> 02:41.161
I have the dust that protects the road

02:41.244 --> 02:45.540
I have the branches of
a leafless tree

02:45.623 --> 02:49.961
I'm the guardian of the tired night

02:50.044 --> 02:55.717
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

02:56.718 --> 03:01.014
Even when the clouds drift away

03:01.097 --> 03:04.350
Even when my skin dries away

03:05.184 --> 03:09.355
I'll be back someday

03:09.439 --> 03:14.319
To unleash my return

03:20.116 --> 03:22.535
A quarter to six!

03:23.536 --> 03:26.331
Wake up, this ain't a vacation!

03:29.334 --> 03:32.170
Ten minutes for showering!
Get up, people!

03:37.425 --> 03:40.386
Get up, people! Up, I said!

03:46.267 --> 03:48.811
-Gastón!
-Yasolórzano.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.856
Miguel!

03:51.940 --> 03:53.483
Céspedes, Céspedes.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.818
Enrique!

03:55.902 --> 03:57.320
Contreras Vidal.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.030
Stand up.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.787
Button up that shirt,
this ain't a party.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.334
One more infraction,

04:11.417 --> 04:13.586
and you'll spend a month in isolation.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.339
Joaquín!

04:16.422 --> 04:17.674
Guzmán Loera.

04:19.592 --> 04:21.469
Silence!

04:29.018 --> 04:30.687
Five minutes for breakfast.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.337
One hour in the courtyard.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.589
Eyes down.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.197
Time to eat!

05:49.015 --> 05:50.308
Walk.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.983
Silence!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.526
Four more, go.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.277
Good night, Samuel.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.947
Good night, professor.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.158
Good night, Quique.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.829
Good night, Professor Rubén.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.672
Let's go, bitches.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.549
A quarter to six!

07:05.842 --> 07:08.302
Get up, this ain't a vacation!

07:14.225 --> 07:15.977
Out of your cells!

07:25.903 --> 07:29.031
Backs against the wall,
eyes down.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.744
Don't look!

07:33.828 --> 07:35.079
Eyes down.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.998
I heard you've been crying at night.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.584
Answer me!

07:39.667 --> 07:41.502
-No.
-No, what?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.795
No, sir.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.632
If I find out you're crying
and the other inmates can't sleep...

07:47.633 --> 07:51.512
I'll make you cry
for a month in isolation.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.223
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.766
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.604
In this prison, you can only eat...

08:00.980 --> 08:02.356
sleep...

08:02.440 --> 08:04.358
and breathe.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.820
Got it?

08:07.904 --> 08:09.489
Yes, sir.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.824
-Got it?
-Yes, sir!

08:21.918 --> 08:24.837
My daughter told me
she had sent more letters.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.676
They never gave them to me.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.845
Sons of bitches.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.267
Is security always this tight?

08:45.191 --> 08:48.027
Everything is forbidden here, Chapo.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.994
Even dying.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.494
One line. Walk.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.098
Empty your bag.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.742
This stays here.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.663
Take off your ring,
earrings, and glasses.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.924
Go on.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.096
Next.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.611
-Take off your clothes.
-Excuse me?

11:35.694 --> 11:38.030
Take off your clothes, please.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.866
I've been searched twice.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.412
It's procedure.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.832
If you refuse, there's the door.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.294
Stand there, please.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.067
You can't bring blue pens.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.277
Excuse me?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.946
I said you can't bring blue pens.

12:19.029 --> 12:23.367
Miss, I've done everything you've asked.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.827
Let me see my son.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.006
Time's up.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
It's no coincidence

12:44.263 --> 12:45.764
they're not letting you
see your mom.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.730
It's one of their games, Chapo.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.150
They want to break you.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.534
How are the kids, and how's Mom?

13:46.617 --> 13:49.995
Everyone's fine.
They want to know how you are.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.708
Any news on Toño and Chío?

13:56.335 --> 14:01.298
They're in another cell block,
but that's all I know.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.431
Did you talk to the person
who promised me a bigger cage?

14:09.515 --> 14:10.683
All I can do for you...

14:12.017 --> 14:14.937
is move you to another penitentiary.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.689
A friendlier one.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.744
He will keep his promise,
but he says you have to wait.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.540
How long?

14:35.916 --> 14:38.294
Years. A few, at least.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.524
JOURNALIST GABRIELA SAAVEDRA
MURDERED IN STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES

17:11.363 --> 17:12.990
Were you looking for this?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.415
On your feet.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.427
Let's take a walk.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.056
Move.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.452
Give me the keys.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.678
Let's go.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.302
What are you looking at?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.349
Where?

19:02.432 --> 19:04.017
Keep driving straight.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.144
Has anyone made a friend here?

22:43.236 --> 22:44.821
Do you mean the guards?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.239
Yeah.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.616
No.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.868
They're watched all the time.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.745
Their schedule changes
almost every single day.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.121
What about the doctor?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.623
The cooks?

22:54.706 --> 22:55.791
No.

22:57.626 --> 23:02.047
Same thing.
The Lawyer changes their schedule.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.174
Who's the Lawyer?

23:04.257 --> 23:05.842
She's in charge of the prison.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.886
Wait, I thought De Tavira was in charge?

23:07.969 --> 23:10.806
He only handles
the administrative stuff.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.975
The Lawyer controls the daily stuff.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.228
She's a criminal protected by the law.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.481
Don't mess with her, Chapo.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.341
All new houses have flaws.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.804
I just need you to find one
so I can focus on it.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.522
General Blanco's body
was found this morning.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.442
He was one of the most important men
in the Federal Judicial Police

24:04.526 --> 24:07.112
in our country.
It is believed to a robbery.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.531
The president
is saddened by this tragic event

24:09.614 --> 24:12.367
and demands a thorough investigation.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.333
General Blanco was my mentor, sir.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.756
I'll help you find the perpetrators,
no matter what.

24:28.216 --> 24:32.262
Thank you, Conrado.
Let's keep his family informed.

24:33.388 --> 24:34.431
Of course.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.201
A BRIEF AND MODERN HISTORY
OF MEXICO

25:05.003 --> 25:06.379
Hey.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.008
What did you do to end up here?

25:10.091 --> 25:11.176
I didn't do anything.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.887
I'm innocent.

25:13.970 --> 25:18.475
Me, too.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.269
Ask my lawyer
if you don't believe me.

25:21.353 --> 25:24.105
And you, Professor?
What did you do?

25:25.440 --> 25:28.568
We blocked a road
with my comrades.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.487
We were protesting.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.905
That's it?

25:32.739 --> 25:35.659
The government
considers it a federal crime.

25:35.742 --> 25:39.246
They treat us worse
than they treat you drug lords.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.208
How long have you been here?

25:45.126 --> 25:47.754
You really don't want to know, Chapo.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.609
Any news?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.194
The new house has got a fat cat.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.404
Do you know him?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.158
The fattest cat?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.244
Yeah.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.871
His kitten's been sick
for some time.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.582
They don't have money
to take her to the vet.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.034
I can pay for your girl's treatment.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.103
No dinner for Guzmán.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.298
I need sleeping pills.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.761
The doctor used to give us those.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.639
But the Lawyer banned them.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.102
We feel you, Chapo.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.229
We can't sleep either.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.814
But you're new here, Chapo.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.402
With the punch you took,
you should ask see the doc.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.946
Maybe he'll give you something.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.295
If they catch you,
they'll fuck you up.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.546
Silence!

29:42.405 --> 29:44.115
Good night, Samuel.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.159
Good night, Professor.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.703
Good night, Quique.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.748
Good night, Professor Rubén.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.416
Good night, Chapo.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.087
Good night, Professor.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.156
Out!

30:26.741 --> 30:28.368
Out of your cells!

31:07.448 --> 31:08.825
Get him out.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.619
What is it?

31:11.828 --> 31:12.871
What is it?

31:12.954 --> 31:14.080
Come on.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.457
What is it?

31:36.853 --> 31:40.648
You can't have pills
without the doctor's authorization.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.652
Who gave them to you?

31:47.655 --> 31:49.532
Who gave them to you?

32:00.001 --> 32:01.419
You're going to the padded room.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.339
No, please, no!

32:04.422 --> 32:06.299
Please... beat me!

32:06.382 --> 32:07.800
Take my food!

32:07.884 --> 32:10.887
But, please, don't send me there,
I'm begging you, please...

32:10.970 --> 32:13.139
I'm begging you, please!

32:13.222 --> 32:14.557
Please, I'm begging you!

32:14.641 --> 32:16.517
Don't do this!

32:16.601 --> 32:18.436
Don't send me there!

32:18.519 --> 32:21.314
Please, don't! No!

32:21.397 --> 32:24.359
No! Not that place!

32:24.442 --> 32:26.945
No, no, no!

32:35.578 --> 32:36.579
Samuel.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.873
What's the padded room?

32:40.750 --> 32:41.960
You sent him there.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.296
Son of a bitch!

32:48.174 --> 32:50.009
Watch your mouth, asshole.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.470
Rubén was brave enough to be quiet.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.055
Don't you be the one that snitches.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.684
They'll hear us.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.938
Quique here
is scared out of his fucking mind.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.487
What's the padded room, Quique?

33:16.202 --> 33:18.955
The worst punishment, Chapo.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.380
It's the end of the world.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.573
-Lunch time.
-I'm not eating.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.838
Lunch time.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.048
I'm staying here.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.510
Walk!

34:16.596 --> 34:17.597
Get them out.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.517
What's going on?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.519
What's going on?

34:55.176 --> 34:57.887
The Lawyer would like to remind you

34:57.970 --> 35:01.182
you have to follow the rules here.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.354
Not eating breaks the rules.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.031
Quique.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.119
Have you ever been
where Rubén is?

36:03.202 --> 36:04.537
Just a couple of days.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.372
And I don't ever wanna go back.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.458
If the rooms weren't padded,

36:09.542 --> 36:12.211
one would hurt themselves
out of desperation.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.687
My daughter got worse.

37:52.561 --> 37:53.980
Mom.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.064
My boy.

37:55.147 --> 37:56.399
My boy...

37:59.402 --> 38:00.403
Darling...

38:01.570 --> 38:02.571
I'm sitting there.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.709
I've been praying for you every day.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.253
Look at you.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.508
Don't worry, mom.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.760
I'm tough as nails.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.607
Chapo says you owe him.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.212
Good night, Samuel.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.172
Good night, Chapo.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.176
Good night, Quique.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.261
Good night, Chapo.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.977
How long until Rubén is back?

39:57.061 --> 39:59.980
A couple of nights,
and the punishment will be over.
