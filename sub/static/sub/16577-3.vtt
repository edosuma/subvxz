09:49.942 --> 09:54.144
- Let's talk about this.
- Grab the Shacks.

09:54.146 --> 09:56.547
Mazel teezy, my neezies.

09:57.366 --> 10:00.117
- Oh, boy, okay.
- Uh, this is not worth it.

10:12.564 --> 10:13.764
Ah, my Nubian princess.

10:13.766 --> 10:18.805
- Hey, you must be Ebony.
- No, Ebony is over there.

10:19.872 --> 10:22.739
Malik?
As-salaam alaikum, my brother.

10:22.741 --> 10:25.209
- Ebony?
- My government name is Lindsey.

10:25.211 --> 10:28.312
Is that bean pie for me?
It's beautiful.

10:28.314 --> 10:30.714
Yeah, you... you ever
have one of these?

10:30.716 --> 10:31.982
Had 'em?
I love 'em!

10:31.984 --> 10:34.685
Wow, you're even more handsome
than I imagined, Malik.

10:34.687 --> 10:36.887
- And I know what you're thinking.
- You do?

10:36.889 --> 10:39.189
Yeah, I'm pretty small for an activist.

10:39.191 --> 10:42.292
Believe me, this petite frame
can take a Taser.

10:42.294 --> 10:43.994
Oh yeah, peep this.
I got this one

10:43.996 --> 10:46.530
at a Black Lives Matter rally,
back when it was cool.

10:46.532 --> 10:49.099
That's nothing.
I got this at Ferguson.

10:49.101 --> 10:53.437
Rubber bullet, 12 gauge.
Go ahead, touch it.

10:53.439 --> 10:54.504
You like that, huh?

10:54.506 --> 10:57.507
I love that.

10:57.509 --> 11:00.177
Um, can I get you another
Black Power-Ade?

11:00.179 --> 11:02.145
I would love one.

11:02.147 --> 11:06.283
<i> How you going to bring
a blue-eyed devil to the party?</i>

11:06.285 --> 11:08.685
<i>- Race traitor.
- I wonder if brothers know I'm gay.</i>

11:08.687 --> 11:12.322
Hey, I got to step over to the
bathroom... I'll be white back.

11:12.324 --> 11:14.858
I mean, right black.
I mean, sit tight.

11:15.260 --> 11:16.827
Think, Malik.
Think, think, think.

11:16.829 --> 11:19.696
You need somebody who's had
experience with girls.

11:20.466 --> 11:23.467
Malik?
Why you interrupting my spa time?

11:23.469 --> 11:25.936
Hey, I'm on a play date with
this girl I met on the internet.

11:25.938 --> 11:27.671
- You [bleep] yet?
- I'm eight.

11:27.673 --> 11:30.207
Aw, man I thought you said
you was on a date.

11:30.209 --> 11:31.842
Man, will you shut up and listen?

11:31.844 --> 11:34.544
I really, really like this girl.
But there's just one problem.

11:34.546 --> 11:35.746
She's white.

11:35.748 --> 11:37.147
Oh, I get it.
You've been popping

11:37.149 --> 11:39.549
all that black shit,
and now you don't want niggas

11:39.551 --> 11:41.952
in the 'hood
to see you with that yakub.

11:41.954 --> 11:43.253
Yeah, Negro.
What do I do?

11:43.255 --> 11:44.589
Aye, yo, tell you what.

11:44.590 --> 11:47.124
Yo take that pink toe
to the white part of town.

11:47.126 --> 11:48.892
Ain't nobody going to see you
if you go West.

11:48.894 --> 11:53.163
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'ma marinate in this Jacuzzi.

11:56.334 --> 11:57.801
<i> Go, White girl.</i>

11:57.803 --> 11:59.803
<i>Go, White girl.
Go, White girl.</i>

11:59.805 --> 12:01.271
<i>Go, White girl.</i>

12:01.806 --> 12:03.941
- We here.
- Jamal, where the hell

12:03.943 --> 12:05.609
- is the subway?
- Right there.

12:05.611 --> 12:08.912
I'm thinking
Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki

12:08.914 --> 12:11.866
with some SunChips on the side.
What about you?

12:11.867 --> 12:14.051
Your chunky ass was
talking about getting food?

12:14.053 --> 12:15.953
How the hell
is this going to help us?

12:16.922 --> 12:19.089
Damn you was right, my dude.

12:19.091 --> 12:21.931
- I do feel better.
- This Spicy Italian is on point.

12:21.966 --> 12:25.529
I told you, my nigs.
I'm going back for a warm cookie.

12:25.531 --> 12:27.297
Ha ha, well, well, well.

12:27.299 --> 12:29.967
The Shalom Avenue Rydaz
got gassed again.

12:29.969 --> 12:32.336
<i>But there is still time.
'Cause my favorite</i>

12:32.338 --> 12:34.838
sandwich artist, Tina,
just dropped that dime

12:34.840 --> 12:36.740
<i>that they're making their way
up Elm Street.</i>

12:36.742 --> 12:38.459
<i>You might have won that round,</i>

12:38.460 --> 12:41.044
but they're on your heels.
But you know the deal.

12:41.046 --> 12:43.380
<i>And shit is about to get real,
and those fools kill.</i>

12:43.382 --> 12:45.816
And speaking of kill,
I need a killer deal

12:45.818 --> 12:47.150
on some Daytons for my Regal.

12:47.152 --> 12:49.619
Why do we have to leave?
I was having fun.

12:49.621 --> 12:51.588
If you've been to one
Black Panther Party party,

12:51.590 --> 12:52.522
you've been to them all.

12:52.524 --> 12:54.858
Besides, you know a brother
like to be spontaneous.

12:54.860 --> 12:58.662
Ooh, spontaneous.
Nat Turner was spontaneous.

12:59.732 --> 13:02.399
Damn, I'm lethargic.

13:02.401 --> 13:05.836
Man, ain't nobody got time
for Latin. Bring yo ass.

13:05.838 --> 13:08.739
<i>♪ Ooh, baby ♪</i>

13:08.741 --> 13:11.050
Finally, some
East Chain freak-a-leaks.

13:11.085 --> 13:14.644
Damn, she got big titties
just like your mom, Milk.

13:14.646 --> 13:16.646
- Ah!
- Hey, boys, you look lost.

13:16.648 --> 13:19.016
- Do you need some help?
- Yeah, we're trying to get

13:19.018 --> 13:20.217
back to Chamberlain Heights.

13:20.219 --> 13:22.085
We're the star players
of the basketball team.

13:22.087 --> 13:24.187
- We Legends, baby.
- Aye, we need to bounce.

13:24.189 --> 13:27.391
- Our game starts in a hour.
- Really, I was just about

13:27.393 --> 13:29.827
to head over there.
My name is Ellen, um...

13:29.828 --> 13:32.929
I can give you guys a ride. I just
have to take a hot shower first.

13:32.931 --> 13:37.201
My boobs are really dirty.
You want to come in?

13:39.438 --> 13:43.240
These are some of my friends.
This is Tegan and that's Sarah.

13:43.242 --> 13:46.043
Oh, my God.
Hey, what's in the bag, cutie?

13:46.045 --> 13:48.145
Oh, these?
I just copped the new Shackles.

13:48.147 --> 13:51.733
Wow, lucky boy.
You can't find those anywhere.

13:51.768 --> 13:55.685
Mmm, there's nothing hotter
than a guy who spends

13:55.687 --> 13:58.155
more money on shoes than I do.

13:58.157 --> 13:59.623
Do you guys like older women?

13:59.625 --> 14:02.492
Hell, yeah... high school girls
are so inexperienced.

14:02.494 --> 14:03.860
I ain't been able to find a breezy

14:03.862 --> 14:05.362
who can take
the whole nine yet.

14:05.364 --> 14:06.696
All right,
well why don't you guys

14:06.698 --> 14:07.998
make yourselves
more comfortable?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.400
We're going to go
prepare our vaginas.

14:10.402 --> 14:14.404
Then we'll get this party started.

14:14.406 --> 14:18.175
Looks like these freaks wanna smash.
Good thing I brought these.

14:18.177 --> 14:20.027
Aye, yo, I call dibs on Ellen.

14:20.028 --> 14:22.879
- I think we had a connection.
- Nah, homey, she mine.

14:22.881 --> 14:25.588
<i>- You can have sloppies.
- Man, I always get sloppies.</i>

14:25.623 --> 14:27.551
<i>'Cause you a sloppy dude.
That's what you deserve.</i>

14:27.553 --> 14:28.985
<i>You see when I came
in the door she was</i>

14:28.987 --> 14:30.387
<i>- breaking her neck at me.
- She breaking it</i>

14:30.389 --> 14:32.155
<i>- looking at me, homey.
- Oh, come on, dude.</i>

14:32.157 --> 14:36.093
The WNBA doesn't have any...
fans.

14:36.095 --> 14:40.263
Oh, shit.
We gotta get out of here.

14:40.265 --> 14:44.468
So, you the punk asses who scored
the last pair of Shackles, huh?

14:44.470 --> 14:46.002
I need those for my collection.

14:46.004 --> 14:47.471
Who the hell is you supposed to be?

14:47.473 --> 14:49.473
That's my girlfriend,
Big-Knee Grinder.

14:49.475 --> 14:52.742
You think you can just roll up
on our set like this?

14:52.744 --> 14:54.478
Hold up, y'all in the game?

14:54.480 --> 14:56.646
LSB.
L Street Bleeders.

14:56.648 --> 14:59.416
We rule this hood with an iron dildo.

14:59.418 --> 15:00.584
Now hand the Shacks over.

15:00.586 --> 15:03.487
Hey, look, there's a sale
at Home Depot.

15:03.489 --> 15:04.688
Huh? Where?

15:04.690 --> 15:07.413
Get them niggas!

15:16.202 --> 15:20.871
Legends, come out to plaa-aay.

15:20.873 --> 15:25.142
Legends, come out to plaaa-aay!

15:25.144 --> 15:29.213
<i>All right, my dudes.
We have to be very, very quiet.</i>

15:29.215 --> 15:30.147
<i>Not even a...</i>

15:30.149 --> 15:32.183
Ew, did one of y'all queef?

15:32.185 --> 15:34.652
Is that Sweet Onion Teriyaki?

15:34.654 --> 15:35.720
And a warm cookie?

15:35.722 --> 15:38.356
- He's over here.
- Oh, shit, here she comes.

15:38.358 --> 15:39.724
Let's bounce.

15:43.329 --> 15:45.863
- Got ya!
- Grover, Milk, come on, man!

15:45.865 --> 15:49.867
- Help me!
- Get... the... Shackles.

15:54.573 --> 15:56.774
Don't let them take me, my nigs!

15:56.776 --> 15:59.143
Oh, shit!
What do I do?

15:59.395 --> 16:04.064
- I'm sure Jamal's fine.
- Yeah, what's the worst that can happen?

16:05.233 --> 16:09.670
<i>Wow, check out that sweet
mid-range jump shot.</i>

16:09.672 --> 16:13.874
Beautiful bounce pass.
Layup.

16:13.876 --> 16:16.544
Layup. Layup...

16:16.546 --> 16:20.781
Oh, shit.
Is that what I think it is?

16:20.783 --> 16:22.316
Aye, that better not be a mirage.

16:22.318 --> 16:25.119
<i>- It's a bitch ass hipster.
- Hell yeah.</i>

16:25.121 --> 16:27.034
<i>That's what
I'm talking about, broski.</i>

16:27.069 --> 16:28.756
- That mean we out the hood.
- I've never been happier

16:28.758 --> 16:31.091
to see a guy in tight
pants and a mustache.

16:31.093 --> 16:32.259
- Aw, yeah.
- Whoo, we back

16:32.261 --> 16:33.727
- in Chamberlain, homey.
- I can't believe

16:33.729 --> 16:35.195
you took me to
a Wes Anderson movie.

16:35.197 --> 16:36.504
I love Wes Anderson movies.

16:36.505 --> 16:38.465
Really? You slept
through the whole thing.

16:38.467 --> 16:40.868
- I thought you would enjoy it.
- Why? I was busy

16:40.870 --> 16:41.802
watching "Django" on my iPhone.

16:41.804 --> 16:44.638
Can we do something fun, now?
Something with some action?

16:44.640 --> 16:46.640
There's a lot of action
on this side of town.

16:46.642 --> 16:49.243
- We can find something to get into.
- That's what's up.

16:49.245 --> 16:53.414
How they feel, my dude?

16:53.682 --> 16:56.138
Whoever said,
"Money can't buy happiness,"

16:56.173 --> 16:57.718
ain't never had a pair
of Shackles on they feet.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.454
Let's see Randy's bitch ass
clown on these.

17:00.456 --> 17:03.591
Yo, there go one time.
Let's see if we can get a ride.

17:03.593 --> 17:05.483
Maybe we can still make the game.

17:05.519 --> 17:07.428
- Hey, you kids okay?
- Thank God, Officer.

17:07.430 --> 17:09.964
Can you give us
a ride back to CH?

17:09.965 --> 17:11.131
Our basketball game's starting.

17:11.133 --> 17:12.800
What are you guys doing in
East Chamberlain?

17:12.801 --> 17:14.401
We went there to get
these new sneakers.

17:14.403 --> 17:17.003
We've been running from bangers
trying to jack us all night.

17:17.006 --> 17:19.873
Well, I'm glad you're all right.
Hey, are those Shackles?

17:19.875 --> 17:22.142
Those look like a size 10, son.

17:22.144 --> 17:24.778
- I wear a 10.
- Oh, shit.

17:24.780 --> 17:27.714
Well, the L Street Bleeders
muffed it again.

17:27.717 --> 17:30.417
But for our three little warriors,
that wasn't the end.

17:30.419 --> 17:33.587
They juked and they jived
like brave little nigs.

17:33.589 --> 17:36.090
But you can't escape
the worst gang of them all,

17:36.092 --> 17:40.060
those Goddamn dirty ass
mother[bleep]in' pigs.

17:40.062 --> 17:42.363
- How about this?
- Are you serious?

17:42.365 --> 17:45.165
- Hockey, Malik?
- Come on, it'll be fun.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.900
We'll take two tickets
for the game, please.

17:46.902 --> 17:48.936
There's no hockey tonight.
It's the grand opening

17:48.938 --> 17:51.639
of "Kendrick Lamar Presents:
Boyz n the Hood on Ice"

17:51.641 --> 17:54.308
- Oh, now this we can do!
- Wait, is that

17:54.310 --> 17:56.076
Grover's little brother over there?

17:56.078 --> 17:57.778
And with a white girl, too, though?

17:57.780 --> 18:01.382
Aye, somebody call up CNN
and tell them we got a jumper.

18:03.219 --> 18:05.686
It's getting late.
Um, let... let's call it a night.

18:05.688 --> 18:07.821
All right, enough.
What the [bleep]

18:07.823 --> 18:09.857
- is wrong with you, nigga?
- Wha?

18:09.859 --> 18:12.960
You took me away from
the Black Panther Party party

18:12.962 --> 18:14.561
to go to the whitest part of town

18:14.563 --> 18:16.397
to see a sorry-ass
Wes Anderson movie.

18:16.399 --> 18:19.281
And then you try to sell me
on a hockey game?

18:19.316 --> 18:22.036
But hold up, though.
Did you just call me a "nigga"?

18:22.038 --> 18:23.003
You know what?
I'm sorry.

18:23.005 --> 18:24.304
I was expecting to meet Malcolm X,

18:24.306 --> 18:26.573
and I got "Malcolm in the Middle."

18:26.575 --> 18:28.542
- Ouch.
- Look, Malik, you're just not

18:28.544 --> 18:30.878
the guy I fell in love with
on the internet yesterday.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.347
- We're just two different people.
- How are we different?

18:33.349 --> 18:37.151
- We like all the same things.
- No, we don't.

18:37.153 --> 18:41.789
Good-bye. I hope you find
your blackness, Malik.

18:54.869 --> 18:56.837
Man, coach is going to kill us.

18:56.839 --> 18:58.572
Sorry we missed the game, Coach.

18:58.574 --> 18:59.807
We have a good excuse, I swear.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.509
You mother[bleep]ers was gone?
Shit, I ain't even noticed.

19:02.511 --> 19:05.512
Oh, shit, is that Jamal?
What's he doing in the game?

19:05.514 --> 19:07.548
'Cause it's a blowout, mother[bleep]ers.

19:07.550 --> 19:09.516
Somebody's gotta collect
the garbage time,

19:09.518 --> 19:11.618
so the players that do matter
don't get hurt,

19:11.620 --> 19:12.820
you dumb mother[bleep]ers.

19:12.822 --> 19:14.288
Okay, now... now that
"dumb mother[bleep]er"

19:14.290 --> 19:15.456
might have been unnecessary.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.892
Damn, when did fat boy
get his fundamentals down?

19:18.894 --> 19:21.695
Layup.
Oh, shit, I scored.

19:21.697 --> 19:24.198
I have statistics!

19:24.200 --> 19:26.200
Jamal, how the hell
did you get here?

19:26.202 --> 19:28.268
My boo, Big-Knee,
gave me a ride.

19:28.270 --> 19:29.636
Her cousin play
on the other team,

19:29.638 --> 19:32.072
and, you know, she
helped me step my game up

19:32.074 --> 19:34.641
with some sweet WNBA skills.

19:34.643 --> 19:35.943
Aye, those girls got balls.

19:35.945 --> 19:38.879
Good job, Jamal.
Your first points of the year.

19:38.881 --> 19:39.847
I'm so proud of you.

19:39.849 --> 19:43.083
I almost had a pair of
Shackles today, Cindy.

19:43.085 --> 19:45.652
Oh, okay, uh, I'll just
tell you about it later.

19:45.654 --> 19:47.622
I'm a legend, my nigs.

19:48.879 --> 19:51.013
Hey, how did your play
date with Ebony go?

19:51.015 --> 19:52.648
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Uh, sound like

19:52.650 --> 19:55.384
- no love connection, esé.
- Do you want me to bully her

19:55.386 --> 19:57.186
on Facebook until she kill herself?

19:57.188 --> 20:00.356
Nah, let her live.
Love is a complicated thing.

20:00.358 --> 20:01.157
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:01.159 --> 20:02.525
Anyway, now back to this money.

20:02.527 --> 20:04.326
All these sad white people
out here, and all y'all got

20:04.328 --> 20:05.394
is Chiclets in your pockets?

20:05.396 --> 20:09.198
Man, y'all better get to stepping
and go get my paper.

20:11.568 --> 20:13.402
<i>Shiiiit.</i>

20:15.505 --> 20:18.040
What's up, my nig? Sorry
about ditching you tonight.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.308
You wanna
get down on some grub?

20:19.310 --> 20:20.794
Nah, sorry, homies.

20:20.795 --> 20:24.213
I already made plans
with my new friends.

20:24.215 --> 20:26.015
Yeah, we going out for Mexican.

20:26.017 --> 20:30.886
For some reason,
they really love fish tacos.

20:32.790 --> 20:35.524
Damn, today was a big ass
dookie burger with cheese.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.360
Yeah, I don't think going
after these kicks was worth it.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.497
I guess it doesn't pay to be a slave
to the shoe game.

20:41.499 --> 20:44.700
I'm just glad this night
is finally over.

20:45.837 --> 20:48.304
<i>What are those?!</i>

20:48.306 --> 20:51.507
