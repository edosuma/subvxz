00:00.919 --> 00:04.506
<i>How do I take off
a mask when it stops
being a mask,</i>

00:04.589 --> 00:06.508
<i>when it's as much
a part of me as I am?</i>

00:06.591 --> 00:07.676
<i>- 10:00 a.m.</i>
- Amen.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.095
<i>12:00 p.m.</i>
Life, love...

00:10.178 --> 00:11.721
<i>2:00 p.m.</i>
I'm Ray.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.599
<i>To stay as sane as
possible until he's gone.</i>

00:14.766 --> 00:16.601
I am not to be
gotten rid of.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.270
<i>I find you
refreshing, young, bold...</i>

00:19.354 --> 00:21.106
Exactly what we
need right now.

00:21.773 --> 00:24.275
The FBI believes that
I was behind the hack.

00:24.359 --> 00:25.527
Gideon's gonna rat you out.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.864
<i>Something ain't
right about this guy.</i>
Bang!

00:29.948 --> 00:31.116
I don't trust him.

00:31.574 --> 00:35.036
<i>We are in a war,
and they are picking us off
one by one.</i>

00:36.246 --> 00:39.916
<i>Tyrell Wellick
and fsociety engaged
in this attack.</i>

00:42.293 --> 00:44.129
Bonsoir, <i>Elliot.</i>

01:04.149 --> 01:05.900
All right, man,
explain this to me again.

01:05.984 --> 01:07.944
Why are you
taking me to an arcade?

01:08.737 --> 01:10.905
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
but you don't listen.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.241
That's the problem
with your generation,

01:13.324 --> 01:15.243
too ADD to really
take in this world.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.412
All right, all right,
break it down for me.

01:17.954 --> 01:20.999
Well, to really get it,
I got to take you
back to 1924.

01:21.583 --> 01:23.918
Husband-and-wife team,
the Bedfords...
Uh-huh.

01:24.002 --> 01:26.337
...opened up a freak
show/dwarf sanctuary

01:26.421 --> 01:28.006
on this land
you're about to be at.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.174
Dwarf sanctuary?

01:29.257 --> 01:30.759
Yeah, they called it
the Bedford Lilliputian.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.094
A whole miniature
city scaled down

01:33.178 --> 01:35.180
for dwarf and
midget inhabitants.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.099
I mean, they also had
other freaks like
lion-faced man,

01:38.183 --> 01:40.101
limbless woman,
shit like that.

01:40.185 --> 01:42.604
But the dwarves were
the big money-maker.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.190
Suffice to say,
the Bedfords were
a big hit.

01:45.315 --> 01:46.941
Lines around
the corner...
Uh-huh.

01:47.025 --> 01:48.860
...the biggest attraction
out here in Coney Island.

01:49.861 --> 01:51.029
Then one year,
rumor has it,

01:51.112 --> 01:53.281
the husband wakes up one
Christmas morning,

01:53.531 --> 01:54.991
grabs a large
kitchen knife,

01:55.325 --> 01:57.368
slices his wife's
throat open,

01:57.452 --> 01:59.120
stabs his
little kids to death,

01:59.287 --> 02:01.372
then slits
his own wrists.
Ugh.

02:01.706 --> 02:02.999
No motive was
ever determined.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.459
God.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.544
Cut to the 1960s.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.797
Woman named
Mary Meghan Fisher

02:08.880 --> 02:10.673
decided to
buy up the place,

02:10.799 --> 02:13.051
turned it into
an old-school arcade,

02:13.468 --> 02:15.136
pinball machines,
skee-ball, the likes.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.721
Called it
Games Games Games.

02:17.055 --> 02:19.808
Shit, a bit on the nose,
if you ask me,

02:19.891 --> 02:22.644
not to mention repetitive,
but at least it had clarity.

02:23.228 --> 02:24.896
Mary Meghan even
installed a little bar

02:24.979 --> 02:26.397
so she could get
drunk with her friends

02:26.481 --> 02:28.149
and shoot pool at night.

02:28.358 --> 02:31.152
And so she did,
almost every night.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.697
Till one time in '86,
she got so liquored up,

02:35.156 --> 02:37.242
she accidentally
fell off the bar stool

02:37.575 --> 02:38.910
and landed hard
on the pool cue

02:39.035 --> 02:40.203
she was holding.
Oh.

02:40.662 --> 02:42.497
Went right through
her neck, clean.

02:42.664 --> 02:43.665
Killed her
right on the spot.

02:43.748 --> 02:46.417
What in the fuck are you
telling me this for, man?

02:52.757 --> 02:55.176
Place remained
dormant until 2000,

02:55.593 --> 02:58.096
when Ned Bosham bought up
the joint under the name

02:58.680 --> 03:01.224
Fun Society Amusement, LLC.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.269
Ned wanted to reopen
it as a classic arcade.

03:04.352 --> 03:08.773
Now, why anyone would want
to start an arcade
in 2000 beats me,

03:08.898 --> 03:10.275
but Ned Bosham
had it in his mind

03:10.358 --> 03:11.776
that that's what
he wanted to do,

03:11.860 --> 03:13.862
and so he did.

03:18.408 --> 03:20.118
About a year ago,
his oldest son, Harold,

03:20.243 --> 03:22.704
wanted to sell it,
but Ned wasn't
down with that.

03:23.872 --> 03:26.457
So the oldest son, Harold,
being simpleminded
and needing money

03:26.541 --> 03:30.044
for whatever simpleminded
folks need money for,
decided Dad had to go.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.048
So Harold stole
his twin brother's
hunting rifle

03:34.299 --> 03:35.884
and shot Dad
in the face.

03:36.885 --> 03:39.304
Now, what Harold
wasn't counting on,

03:39.387 --> 03:42.140
considering he had never
fired a weapon before,
was the kickback.

03:42.724 --> 03:44.434
It kicked back so hard,
he tripped and fell

03:44.559 --> 03:46.311
out of his dad's
20-story window.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.730
By the time
he hit the ground,
his head opened up

03:48.813 --> 03:50.899
like one of those
Gallagher watermelons.

03:50.982 --> 03:52.817
All this commotion
stirred awake

03:52.942 --> 03:54.068
his twin brother, Clyde,

03:54.319 --> 03:56.154
who, as he told it to me,
was in his bedroom

03:56.321 --> 03:58.156
catching some Zs
when all this went down.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.824
By the time he got
his bearings,

03:59.908 --> 04:02.160
he was immediately arrested
for the double homicide

04:02.243 --> 04:05.246
of his brother and father,
being the weapon
was in his name.

04:06.456 --> 04:07.832
And how do you know Clyde?

04:07.999 --> 04:09.334
He was my cellmate.

04:11.461 --> 04:13.504
This place
made him crazy.

04:14.005 --> 04:15.256
He thinks it's cursed.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.592
Yeah. No shit, Sherlock.

04:18.009 --> 04:20.261
Before I left the clink,
he gave me the keys
to the joint

04:20.345 --> 04:21.846
and made me
swear to burn it down

04:22.013 --> 04:23.514
before it caused
any more ruckus.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.433
He swears it's haunted.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.353
Believes it is the nexus
of all evil in the universe.

04:31.940 --> 04:33.274
You buy into
any of this shit?

04:34.317 --> 04:37.195
Fuck no, man.
I'm too broke to
be superstitious.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.531
In a way, all this
hocus-pocus

04:40.698 --> 04:42.992
keeps things clean
for whatever it is
you need to do.

04:43.952 --> 04:45.370
The public
records are in limbo.

04:45.495 --> 04:48.122
People down in county
don't even want to
touch the place.

04:48.206 --> 04:50.041
I'm siphoning electricity
from the grid.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.043
As far as
anyone's concerned,
it don't exist.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.129
Now, on the market,
this joint would run you
about five grand a month,

04:55.213 --> 04:57.966
but since it's you,
I'll give it to your
guy for half.

04:59.509 --> 05:00.969
Come on, Mobley,
don't give me
that look, man.

05:01.052 --> 05:03.554
You know how hard it is
for an ex-con to get a job.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.848
Money's tight,

05:06.557 --> 05:09.143
especially with
my mom's cataracts.
The bills are adding up.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.482
I'm not here to
rent from you, Romero.

05:16.234 --> 05:17.652
I want you to
work with us.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.904
Hell no, man.
I just got out.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.823
I ain't trying to
go back no time soon.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.408
Just hear
my guy out, okay?

05:23.491 --> 05:24.659
We need a phreaker.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.494
Now, you know you're
the best in the game.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.162
Don't try to
sweet-talk me,
motherfucker.

05:28.246 --> 05:30.164
I don't need you to
tell me who's the
best in the game.

05:30.248 --> 05:31.874
I invented
this shit, okay?

05:32.500 --> 05:35.753
Now, either you're renting,
or I'm finding
somebody else,

05:35.837 --> 05:38.423
but I cannot get
mixed up in whatever
it is you're doing.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.009
Man, this is a chance
to get back at the system

05:41.175 --> 05:43.594
that stole
six years of your life.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.266
This is a
game changer, man.

05:49.851 --> 05:51.728
Who's this guy, again?

05:53.104 --> 05:55.106
He's... He's
a little weird.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.233
But he's gonna
love this place.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.861
He's got a thing
for Coney Island.

06:01.029 --> 06:02.613
You'll like him.

06:03.865 --> 06:06.784
Actually, you'll hate him.
But he's a genius.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.287
Best coder
I've ever met.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.414
And he wants to
meet you.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.709
How much?

06:15.960 --> 06:18.046
Oh, don't smile.
I ain't said yes yet.

06:18.713 --> 06:20.798
Money's gonna be
the deciding factor
in all this,

06:20.923 --> 06:23.801
and it's gonna need to
be a whole lot to
bring me back in.

06:24.886 --> 06:26.763
That's the thing, man.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.725
In a way,
this pays everything.

06:37.899 --> 06:39.400
What happened to
the "U" and the "N"?

06:39.650 --> 06:43.154
That? That's a story
for another time.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.720
<i>Panic.
Here it comes again.</i>

07:50.513 --> 07:54.142
<i>Remember? That sudden
sensation of fear,</i>

07:54.725 --> 07:56.394
<i>overwhelming fear,</i>

07:57.812 --> 08:00.398
<i>burrowing its way
underneath my brain,</i>

08:01.023 --> 08:02.984
<i>making itself at home.</i>

08:04.986 --> 08:06.320
<i>Nesting.</i>

08:12.368 --> 08:13.828
<i>Screaming in my mind.</i>

08:32.013 --> 08:33.681
<i>It's good to
hear your voice.</i>

08:39.270 --> 08:40.771
Where are you?

08:42.940 --> 08:44.692
<i>Not yet where
I'm supposed to be.</i>

08:45.860 --> 08:47.695
<i>But soon, very soon.</i>

08:47.778 --> 08:48.779
<i>Protesters are taking to</i>

08:48.905 --> 08:50.031
<i>the streets in
massive numbers,</i>

08:50.114 --> 08:51.699
<i>and police and
community leaders</i>

08:51.782 --> 08:53.618
<i>are at a loss as to
what to do at this point.</i>

08:55.119 --> 08:56.954
And where is that?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.752
<i>I don't think
that's a good idea.</i>

09:05.379 --> 09:07.048
You think
someone's listening?

09:10.134 --> 09:12.595
<i>Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.</i>

09:14.430 --> 09:16.641
<i>You don't want me to have
to worry about you.</i>

09:18.434 --> 09:19.936
I need to know
what's going on.

09:20.144 --> 09:21.479
<i>It's not safe.</i>

09:21.646 --> 09:22.897
<i>I wish it were.</i>

09:24.065 --> 09:26.567
<i>Oh, how I wish.
How I wish.</i>

09:27.568 --> 09:29.487
<i>I think about
you a lot, Elliot.</i>

09:30.154 --> 09:33.783
<i>I think about that night
when we became gods.</i>

09:34.325 --> 09:35.826
That night.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.496
I want to know
what happened.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.293
Tell me
what happened.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.925
Like he said,
it's not safe,
not on the phone.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.930
I'm not gonna let you
make me a prisoner
of my own paranoia again.

09:56.013 --> 09:59.183
If you're not paranoid,
you need me more than
you think you do.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.186
We had a deal.
You wanted to
talk to him.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.271
I delivered.

10:03.354 --> 10:04.855
It's not my fault
he's Looney Tunes.

10:04.981 --> 10:07.024
<i>He really expects
me to believe this?</i>

10:07.358 --> 10:10.111
<i>Did we really talk to
the most wanted man
on the planet?</i>

10:10.194 --> 10:11.529
Why the fuck are
you asking them?

10:11.696 --> 10:13.030
You heard him.
You talked to him.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.324
I talk to you, too.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.701
What do you want, huh?

10:16.784 --> 10:18.703
We had a deal.
I delivered!

10:18.995 --> 10:20.705
What more do you want?

10:21.163 --> 10:22.790
<i>What I've
always wanted.</i>

10:22.873 --> 10:24.709
<i>For the panic
to finally stop.</i>

10:24.792 --> 10:26.627
<i>Shocking news
from last night,</i>

10:26.711 --> 10:29.880
<i>Gideon Goddard,
owner and CEO of
Allsafe Cybersecurity,</i>

10:30.047 --> 10:32.216
<i>considered ground
zero for the 5/9 attacks,</i>

10:32.383 --> 10:34.635
<i>was shot dead at
a bar in Manhattan.</i>

10:34.885 --> 10:37.305
<i>The suspected murderer
surrendered at the scene.</i>

10:37.722 --> 10:40.224
<i>The alleged gunman,
whose name has yet
to be released...</i>

10:40.349 --> 10:41.767
<i>But it won't.</i>

10:47.440 --> 10:49.275
Just don't know why
you can't send me a new one.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.068
You ain't even with E Corp.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.405
Well, I guess
I never figured

10:54.530 --> 10:56.407
you were all in bed
together like that.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.909
How am I supposed
to pay the bills

10:59.076 --> 11:01.620
if my autopay
stopped working?

11:03.247 --> 11:04.457
Okay, somebody's
at the door.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.375
Guess I got to
call you back.

11:07.126 --> 11:09.545
Uh-huh,
like you give a shit.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.088
Door's open. Come on in.

11:12.882 --> 11:14.467
Hi, Mrs. Romero.
Oh.

11:15.301 --> 11:18.095
I don't know where he at.
Ain't seen him for a bit.

11:18.471 --> 11:19.638
Probably downstairs.

11:20.056 --> 11:21.223
You know how he is.

11:21.307 --> 11:23.476
Just comes and goes,
goes and comes.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.776
Rome!

11:32.735 --> 11:35.488
Yo, Rome!
Where you at, man?

11:37.948 --> 11:38.991
Rome.

11:40.493 --> 11:43.496
Whoa. What the fuck
is that smell, man?

11:48.626 --> 11:49.752
Rome?

12:16.195 --> 12:17.196
Rome?

12:29.667 --> 12:30.709
Shit.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.844
<i>...but has
become a citywide epidemic
for families as well.</i>

12:40.010 --> 12:42.847
<i>Now let's check in
with Jessie for our
five-borough weather report.</i>

12:43.722 --> 12:45.933
<i>Thank you, Chris.
I wish I could tell you...</i>

12:46.016 --> 12:48.352
Got those at Mel's.

12:48.519 --> 12:51.689
Beautiful, huh? Sad to see
his shop shut down.

12:56.986 --> 12:59.113
Was gonna leave it
to his nephew, too.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.239
Kid with the burnt face.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.323
You know what
I'm talking about?

13:01.407 --> 13:02.867
What's his name?

13:06.370 --> 13:07.538
Can't think of it.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.791
Anyway, with everything
going on with the trucking,

13:10.875 --> 13:13.043
Mel says fresh deliveries
just aren't coming through.

13:15.588 --> 13:17.882
Besides, now that
the allowance is down
to just $50 a day,

13:18.007 --> 13:19.717
no one's spending it
on flowers.

13:28.267 --> 13:32.062
I swear, the only way
I'm getting through this
is having breakfast with you.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.903
Mets won again.
It's gonna be their year.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.408
Yeah, I know. I know,
I know, I know, I know.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.593
Take it easy with
that dosage, cuz.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.678
I ain't your keeper,
and I damn straight

14:04.762 --> 14:06.764
ain't gonna be
your reaper,
neither, you dig?

14:07.640 --> 14:08.933
Let's go!

14:09.099 --> 14:10.976
What problem you trying
to solve anyway, man?

14:12.394 --> 14:14.897
<i>How do I
tell him that someone
I cared about died?</i>

14:18.108 --> 14:19.318
I'm fine.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.821
You know, that's what
you always saying, man.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.116
So we're back to
the morphine?

14:28.619 --> 14:30.037
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:32.414
What do you think that's
going to accomplish,
exactly?

14:32.498 --> 14:35.084
<i>It's not morphine.
It's Adderall.</i>

14:36.252 --> 14:37.962
This is your fault.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.089
All of it.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.343
Now it's time to
get rid of you.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.998
<i>When a computer
gets hit with a kernel panic,</i>

15:14.123 --> 15:15.833
<i>there's only so
much you can do.</i>

15:16.500 --> 15:19.169
<i>An internal fatal error
is hard to recover from.</i>

15:19.837 --> 15:23.132
<i>I mean, listen to that.
Internal fatal error.</i>

15:23.841 --> 15:25.843
<i>Sounds pretty
fucking bad, you ask me.</i>

15:26.844 --> 15:29.638
<i>But OD'ing on Adderall
was finally my way
of controlling him.</i>

15:38.022 --> 15:40.524
Do you have a moment,
Mr. Alderson?

15:40.858 --> 15:44.028
<i>Is this the FBI?
Did Gideon rat me out?</i>

16:20.564 --> 16:23.400
<i>This is a New Lots
Avenue-bound 4 train.</i>

16:45.422 --> 16:48.717
<i>This is a Brooklyn-bound
2 express train.</i>

16:48.884 --> 16:51.053
<i>Next stop is DeKalb Avenue.</i>

16:55.974 --> 16:58.435
<i>Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.</i>

17:04.983 --> 17:07.486
Elliot and I both
warned you it was
a liability he sold drugs.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.946
God damn it.

17:11.115 --> 17:12.950
Why are you being
such an asshole?

17:13.784 --> 17:15.119
He's dead.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.085
Did anyone see you?

17:25.629 --> 17:26.839
Just his mom.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.761
What did you want me to do?
She was upstairs.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.522
Fuck, Darlene.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.818
What did we do?

18:25.022 --> 18:26.565
Where am I?

18:27.566 --> 18:29.151
Where am I?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.334
What are you doing?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.421
What's that for?

18:50.881 --> 18:52.049
What's that for?

18:59.223 --> 19:00.557
No, no, wait.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.687
No. No!

19:45.602 --> 19:48.272
That's it.
Get that Adderall
out of your system.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.565
Good boy.

19:49.648 --> 19:52.651
That's it,
get those shitty
pills out of your system.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.628
I have burrowed
underneath your brain.

20:12.129 --> 20:16.133
I am nested there.
I am the scream in your mind.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.969
You will cooperate,
my son.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.971
I will make you,
because I own you!

21:00.552 --> 21:02.554
I will not be owned.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.949
First, I want to
offer my condolences.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.575
Terrible news
about your old boss.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.369
I hear he was a good man.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.914
Very unfortunate
when bad things
happen to good people.

21:31.708 --> 21:32.876
Thank you, sir.

21:33.377 --> 21:34.962
I've been pretty
broken up about it.

21:35.045 --> 21:39.549
Second, this interview
that you've set up,
it's all wrong.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.386
I want to do Fox
instead of Bloomberg.

21:42.552 --> 21:48.433
No pre-interview,
and I want final approval
of all questions beforehand.

21:51.395 --> 21:52.729
I'm on it.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.741
Mr. Price?

22:06.034 --> 22:07.285
I think this is a mistake.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.497
Frankly, Fox isn't where
we should be right now.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.624
Bloomberg is where investors
get their business news,

22:12.749 --> 22:14.584
and if our goal is
to reassure them...
Sit down.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.454
Have you ever had
dinner at Fidelio's?

22:55.250 --> 22:56.293
No.

22:57.294 --> 22:58.462
I haven't.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.672
Used to be
a dive bar years ago.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.467
It's since turned
into one of the nicest
restaurants in the city.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.762
I know the chef.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.599
He's very good.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.813
I'll have Marcel
make a reservation.

23:16.980 --> 23:20.650
You've never had Semifreddo
until you've had it there.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.156
Okay.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.164
I'll arrange
a car to pick you up.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.708
Saturday, 8:00.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.212
And, yes, you're right.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.466
Bloomberg.
It's more appropriate.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.469
We'll stick with that.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.351
Thank you, sir.

24:03.527 --> 24:04.778
I've noticed you
always look at that

24:04.861 --> 24:06.530
before you leave my office.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.411
Perhaps you find it as
fascinating as I do...

24:15.872 --> 24:19.709
How a man can change
the whole world

24:20.585 --> 24:23.046
with a bullet in
the right place.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.718
<i>Oh, no, what does
that say?</i>

24:32.013 --> 24:33.557
<i>Don't fall over.</i>

24:36.726 --> 24:38.395
<i>You okay? You okay?</i>

24:40.105 --> 24:41.731
<i>I don't want to go
to sleep another night</i>

24:41.857 --> 24:43.400
<i>not knowing you're
not gonna be my wife.</i>

24:47.571 --> 24:48.905
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

24:53.410 --> 24:56.204
<i>Emilia,
will you marry me?</i>

24:59.749 --> 25:02.252
<i>Next on</i> Million
Dollar Listing New York...

25:02.961 --> 25:04.421
Alexa, what time is it?

25:07.215 --> 25:08.717
<i>It is 4:03 AM.</i>

25:09.759 --> 25:10.760
<i>That's it, not a penny more.</i>

25:10.927 --> 25:11.928
<i>Whatever she says goes...</i>

26:05.357 --> 26:06.816
Alexa, stop.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.671
Ooh. Sorry.
Something's going around.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.340
Victim's mother's
back at the station.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.675
Didn't get much from her.

26:31.841 --> 26:32.842
Down here.

26:37.472 --> 26:38.974
All we got on
the victim so far is,

26:39.057 --> 26:41.017
he's a known
hacker with a record.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.144
Got busted in '08.
Served six years for some

26:43.228 --> 26:44.854
small-time
computer fraud stuff.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.651
Um...
It's okay.
I got gloves on.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.695
Well, it doesn't matter
much if you sneeze

26:53.196 --> 26:54.698
on them. Okay.

26:54.906 --> 26:56.533
Tell you what,
why don't you
hold this still?

26:58.702 --> 27:00.245
We're still looking,

27:00.370 --> 27:01.621
but it looks like
he only printed out

27:01.705 --> 27:03.540
these three sheets
from the full FBI roster.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.128
We contacted
everyone here

27:08.211 --> 27:09.212
at the New York office.

27:09.337 --> 27:10.380
You're the first to respond.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.593
It doesn't mean much.
Thousands of FBI
names and contact details

27:15.719 --> 27:18.346
were leaked a few months back.
Every hacker has this.

27:22.726 --> 27:23.727
What are they doing?

27:25.103 --> 27:27.439
It's forensics. We found
his desktop unlocked.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.316
Uh, once we're
done analyzing it,

27:29.399 --> 27:31.318
we'll send over
a full report.

27:31.401 --> 27:32.736
Did you have them
check if the ports

27:32.861 --> 27:34.195
were modified
at all before using them?

27:36.948 --> 27:38.616
- Shit.
- Fire extinguisher.

27:42.579 --> 27:43.747
Well...

27:47.917 --> 27:49.753
Here's my card in case
you find anything else.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.921
Thanks again
for calling me.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.424
I'd really talk to
your doctor about
getting a Z-Pak.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.218
You really
shouldn't be out here
infecting your whole unit.

27:57.302 --> 27:59.220
It's very
irresponsible of you.

28:37.509 --> 28:38.802
According to
the police report,

28:38.885 --> 28:40.303
there was no
sign of a robbery.

28:40.804 --> 28:43.723
Someone was there
with the sole purpose
of offing him.

28:43.807 --> 28:46.059
You're jumping
to conclusions.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.478
What about
that Allsafe guy?

28:48.645 --> 28:51.481
That's two murders in a row
associated with this hack.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.234
They caught the guy.
It was just some wack-job.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.696
Besides, I don't really care
discussing this with you,

28:58.822 --> 29:00.865
given how easily you forgot
about what we started.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.410
What, because I don't care
for stupid high jinks

29:03.701 --> 29:05.537
like burning money in
the middle of a park?

29:06.246 --> 29:08.123
That stupid high
jinks is killing

29:08.206 --> 29:09.416
public confidence
in E Corp,

29:09.499 --> 29:11.668
which is exactly
what we need to
be doing right now.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.711
We might be getting
executed by the Dark Army,

29:13.837 --> 29:15.380
and this is what you'd
rather be discussing?

29:16.506 --> 29:18.842
It's not the Dark Army.

29:19.384 --> 29:21.845
They don't know
Romero or the two of you.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.179
They only
communicate through me,

29:23.263 --> 29:25.598
and I sure as shit
didn't tell them anything.

29:28.685 --> 29:31.229
You're not the only
person they've talked to.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.195
He wouldn't do that.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.032
The state Elliot's in,
we don't know...

29:43.199 --> 29:45.869
Don't say what
you're thinking.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.706
You don't want to
listen to reason,
that's on you.

29:50.373 --> 29:53.042
But I'm taking off.
I'm not sticking
around to be next.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.378
I'm gonna stay with
my buddy in Arizona.

29:56.087 --> 29:58.214
If they wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.634
Besides, if you're just
gonna end up in Arizona,

30:01.718 --> 30:03.720
then being dead isn't
that much of a downgrade.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.054
Uh-huh?

30:05.555 --> 30:07.390
Then what do you
suggest we do, then?

30:10.059 --> 30:11.436
I'll talk to Elliot.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.731
I'll hit you both
when I get more info.
Until then,

30:16.065 --> 30:17.734
stop spazzing.

30:22.572 --> 30:23.990
And be cool.

30:40.131 --> 30:43.092
I don't trust her or
her crazy-ass brother.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.013
You know he tried to
pull a gun on Romero?

30:49.349 --> 30:50.892
Think about it, Trenton.
They're the only two

30:50.975 --> 30:51.976
that talked
to the Dark Army.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.938
Now they're trying to
tell us the Dark Army
isn't involved.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.440
What are you saying?

30:59.275 --> 31:02.445
I'm saying we just committed
the crime of the century,

31:03.321 --> 31:04.572
and they're trying
to cover their tracks.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.991
And right now,
we're the tracks.

31:13.289 --> 31:15.208
A lot of life is
a balancing act.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.212
We're all just
doing our best,

31:21.130 --> 31:24.801
tightrope walking above
that pit of ungodly pain

31:24.884 --> 31:26.469
that's daring us
to trip up.

31:29.514 --> 31:31.391
Take money and health.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.477
One isn't very useful
without the other, you know?

31:35.478 --> 31:36.980
Case in point,

31:37.647 --> 31:39.983
even though you've
been paid handsomely,

31:41.651 --> 31:42.944
the physical condition
you're in right now

31:43.027 --> 31:45.196
kind of
cancels that out.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.490
And I'd like to
say upfront...

31:49.492 --> 31:51.494
I'm very sorry
this happened to you.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.164
The guys I deal with,
they can be ruthless.

31:56.082 --> 31:59.085
Me, I'm more of a positive
reinforcement kind of guy.

32:00.003 --> 32:03.131
You know,
I just happen to think
it's more productive.

32:07.051 --> 32:10.346
Nevertheless,
that don't change
what's been done to you.

32:13.016 --> 32:16.227
The person who did this
will get proportionate
retribution.

32:18.938 --> 32:22.233
On that tip,
I still need you to
fix this thing for me.

32:24.277 --> 32:26.112
Our site's been
down way too long.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.366
Good news is,
once you bring it back up,

32:31.200 --> 32:34.078
you will get your money,
and, in time,

32:34.871 --> 32:36.372
God willing, your health.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.710
That's all
I want to do here.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.131
Help put your life
back in balance.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.556
They keep emptying
the Bitcoin wallets,

32:54.724 --> 32:56.059
and the server
keeps crashing.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.602
I don't know
how to stop it.

32:58.311 --> 33:01.314
I only know basic
network security measures.

33:01.397 --> 33:02.899
You have to
find someone who...

33:04.233 --> 33:09.405
Who can migrate
the site to another
more secure location,

33:09.489 --> 33:12.450
and set up a system of
hot and cold wallets.

33:16.913 --> 33:18.247
Please.

33:20.583 --> 33:21.793
Please.

33:22.460 --> 33:24.921
I can't...
I can't figure it out.

33:51.364 --> 33:52.949
I could try to
convince him again.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.619
Just because you beat
a man's face to a pulp

33:56.703 --> 33:58.621
don't mean he gonna
know what he don't.

33:59.956 --> 34:01.624
We're not animals.

34:02.625 --> 34:03.710
We need to find
someone who can do

34:03.793 --> 34:05.461
that migration thing
he keep talking about.

34:08.965 --> 34:11.384
This heat wave
is a motherfucker.

34:12.009 --> 34:14.220
What's the high
supposed to be today?

34:16.806 --> 34:18.141
What you looking
at me for?

34:18.307 --> 34:20.309
Turn on the goddamn
weather station, let's go.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.323
<i>Can I tell you
a secret?</i>

34:34.824 --> 34:37.160
<i>It's been three
days since I slept.</i>

34:38.661 --> 34:41.330
<i>I'm up to about
200 milligrams now.</i>

34:42.248 --> 34:44.333
<i>But that's not the secret.</i>

34:44.500 --> 34:45.835
<i>He's gone.</i>

34:46.335 --> 34:47.837
<i>You heard me.</i>

34:48.379 --> 34:49.714
<i>He's gone.</i>

34:57.555 --> 34:59.182
<i>It was so simple.</i>

35:00.516 --> 35:01.934
<i>I'm way more aware now.</i>

35:02.852 --> 35:04.353
<i>I'm way more focused.</i>

35:05.021 --> 35:06.856
<i>And I'm feeling 100%.</i>

35:10.359 --> 35:13.196
<i>He's gone.
He's gone. He's gone.</i>

35:14.572 --> 35:15.698
<i>The Adderall is working,</i>

35:15.782 --> 35:18.201
<i>and fuck if this drug
doesn't feel good.</i>

35:20.703 --> 35:22.413
<i>I can even handle
talking with people.</i>

35:22.538 --> 35:23.581
Yo, bro, he's like...

35:23.748 --> 35:25.541
<i>Even Leon's stupid</i>
Seinfeld <i>philosophy</i>

35:25.708 --> 35:27.418
<i>is starting to
sound fascinating.</i>

35:28.377 --> 35:30.004
So... So, he just...
He just...

35:30.087 --> 35:32.215
He just ran out of the party,
pushing old people aside?

35:32.298 --> 35:34.550
That's so funny.
Was there even a fire?

35:34.759 --> 35:36.803
I mean, that's
classic George, am I right?

35:37.762 --> 35:39.222
I don't like this, bro.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.061
<i>Why haven't I
done this before?</i>

35:45.978 --> 35:48.064
<i>Damn, these dishes
look immaculate.</i>

35:53.903 --> 35:55.488
<i>I'm pretty sure
I even found God.</i>

35:56.072 --> 35:57.031
Amen. Amen.

35:57.114 --> 35:58.115
Amen. Amen.

35:58.407 --> 35:59.742
Amen.
Amen.

35:59.951 --> 36:01.744
Amen. Amen!

36:01.911 --> 36:04.622
Amen, amen, amen, amen!
Amen! Amen!

36:05.748 --> 36:07.875
<i>Even the dumb basketball
game is enthralling.</i>

36:07.959 --> 36:10.586
<i>The ball goes into a hoop.
Of course.</i>

36:13.506 --> 36:15.341
Slam dunk!

36:15.591 --> 36:17.677
<i>We can finally
be back to normal.</i>

36:17.927 --> 36:19.846
<i>It'll just be me
and you, my friend.</i>

36:19.929 --> 36:21.138
<i>We'll dine together.</i>

36:21.764 --> 36:24.600
<i>Maybe I'll read to you.
Or we'll just talk.</i>

36:24.851 --> 36:27.144
<i>But the point is, he's gone,</i>

36:27.979 --> 36:29.939
<i>and now it's just us.</i>

36:31.691 --> 36:33.442
You're not buying
any of this, either.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.111
<i>Are you?</i>

36:43.995 --> 36:46.706
<i>It was feeling
good for a few days.</i>

36:47.331 --> 36:49.959
<i>It really was, wasn't it?</i>

36:50.960 --> 36:53.796
<i>But this is the fifth
day of not sleeping,</i>

36:54.505 --> 36:55.798
<i>I think.</i>

36:56.465 --> 36:57.675
<i>Fifth.</i>

36:58.384 --> 37:00.344
<i>Isn't that a funny word?</i>

37:00.720 --> 37:01.804
<i>Shit.</i>

37:03.014 --> 37:04.390
<i>There it is again.</i>

37:06.309 --> 37:08.311
<i>The overwhelming
fear building,</i>

37:09.312 --> 37:12.523
<i>the burrowing, the nesting,</i>

37:13.566 --> 37:14.984
<i>the scream.</i>

37:24.076 --> 37:27.038
<i>I know, I know,
Leon's talking backwards.</i>

37:27.371 --> 37:28.664
<i>This isn't good.</i>

37:34.921 --> 37:39.008
<i>Yeah, I know.
That's very weird, too.</i>

37:47.433 --> 37:49.518
<i>My internal
fatal error...</i>

37:51.354 --> 37:54.398
<i>From which my system
cannot safely recover.</i>

38:05.826 --> 38:07.244
<i>Kernel panic.</i>

38:13.876 --> 38:15.920
<i>Day number six
without sleep.</i>

38:19.715 --> 38:21.217
<i>I'm crashing.</i>

38:29.100 --> 38:31.394
<i>Next,
my consciousness will go.</i>

38:38.275 --> 38:40.945
<i>The panic isn't
settling in anymore.</i>

38:42.196 --> 38:43.739
<i>It's just there.</i>

38:45.074 --> 38:47.743
<i>The scream in my
mind is coming back.</i>

39:05.302 --> 39:06.929
You are likable.

39:08.264 --> 39:09.974
You are attractive.

39:13.102 --> 39:14.770
You are beautiful.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.443
Revolution! Revolution!

39:20.609 --> 39:22.486
Revolution! Revolution!

39:22.945 --> 39:24.864
What is
that solution?
Revolution!

39:24.947 --> 39:26.615
Phillip Price, please.

39:26.782 --> 39:27.700
Your party's here.
Do you want me

39:27.783 --> 39:28.951
to show you
to the table?

40:07.364 --> 40:08.616
Angela.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.160
Yes, come. Please, please.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.163
I'd like you to meet
two of your colleagues.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.834
Gentlemen,
introduce yourselves.

40:19.043 --> 40:21.504
Saul Weinberg,
Managing Director
of Operations.

40:21.712 --> 40:23.672
Hi. Angela.
It's nice to meet you.

40:24.173 --> 40:26.675
Jim Chutney, SVP of BA.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.219
Angela.

40:30.554 --> 40:33.182
Phillip Price,
Master of the Universe.

40:39.355 --> 40:40.856
All right.

40:46.737 --> 40:48.030
Mmm-hmm.

40:48.697 --> 40:49.698
Yes.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.993
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.998
Because of the situation,
you have to pay upfront now.

40:59.875 --> 41:02.336
Well, a toast.

41:03.212 --> 41:07.675
May new relationships
lead to new opportunities.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.919
Alexa, when is the
end of the world?

41:46.255 --> 41:48.174
<i>Unless it collides
with a very large rock</i>

41:48.257 --> 41:50.968
<i>or a future technology
goes very wrong indeed,</i>

41:51.093 --> 41:53.679
<i>Earth is most
likely to be destroyed
when the sun swells</i>

41:53.762 --> 41:56.599
<i>into a red giant in
several billion years' time.</i>

42:01.395 --> 42:02.563
Right.

42:56.533 --> 43:01.455
I know you want me
to talk about myself,
but I don't...

43:02.831 --> 43:05.501
<i>The Adderall's
almost out of my system.</i>

43:06.794 --> 43:09.004
<i>With that,
sleep will return.</i>

43:10.172 --> 43:12.383
<i>Any second now,
he's gonna come back,</i>

43:12.508 --> 43:14.843
<i>and my mind will be
under siege again.</i>

43:15.052 --> 43:16.345
This isn't something,
like, I...

43:16.512 --> 43:18.681
<i>Mr. Robot has
become my god,</i>

43:19.014 --> 43:22.768
<i>and like all gods,
their madness
takes you prisoner.</i>

43:22.851 --> 43:24.019
There was this...

43:24.144 --> 43:26.689
<i>I guess I couldn't avoid
Gideon's death after all.</i>

43:27.189 --> 43:29.692
<i>My dam of guilt is
finally cracking.</i>

43:30.192 --> 43:33.195
<i>I want to cry,
but I'm so high
that I can't.</i>

43:33.654 --> 43:37.491
There was an Indian man
working behind the counter,

43:38.033 --> 43:40.244
and I made fun
of his accent.

43:41.370 --> 43:43.163
And talk like this.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.708
"Hello, how are you doing?"

43:46.709 --> 43:48.836
And one day,
he stood up for himself.

43:49.545 --> 43:51.839
"Sir, I must ask you
to leave."

43:55.092 --> 43:57.720
And something
snapped in me,

43:58.721 --> 44:00.848
and I just popped
him in the face.

44:01.432 --> 44:03.058
I saw red, man. I just...

44:03.183 --> 44:06.020
I just kept punching
him and punching him.

44:06.729 --> 44:08.731
And I hated him so much.

44:10.899 --> 44:12.401
He was Indian.

44:16.238 --> 44:18.240
But it was raining.

44:18.949 --> 44:21.952
There was a thunderstorm,
and I remember
stepping outside.

44:22.077 --> 44:25.122
And the clouds parted,
and the sun came out.

44:25.372 --> 44:28.751
And I knew that
that was God

44:28.876 --> 44:31.086
showing up for me
in that moment.

44:33.881 --> 44:35.382
He forgave me.

44:36.050 --> 44:37.593
Jesus loves you.

44:38.635 --> 44:40.763
And this was
clearly just a test.

44:41.430 --> 44:42.931
Amen. Amen.

44:47.644 --> 44:50.564
Elliot,
would you like to share?

44:53.942 --> 44:57.237
<i>No, man.
My system's hung.</i>

44:58.947 --> 45:00.491
God can help you.

45:05.287 --> 45:07.122
Is that what God does?

45:08.624 --> 45:09.917
He helps?

45:12.628 --> 45:14.088
Tell me,

45:15.089 --> 45:18.967
why didn't God
help my innocent friend
who died for no reason

45:19.968 --> 45:22.096
while the guilty roam free?

45:25.140 --> 45:27.142
Okay, fine.

45:28.811 --> 45:29.978
Forget the one-offs.

45:30.479 --> 45:34.483
How about the countless wars
declared in His name?

45:35.484 --> 45:37.528
Okay, fine.

45:37.986 --> 45:39.196
Let's skip the random,

45:39.321 --> 45:41.824
meaningless murder
for a second, shall we?

45:42.324 --> 45:46.161
How about
the racist, sexist,

45:46.829 --> 45:51.500
phobia soup we've
all been drowning in
because of Him?

45:56.004 --> 45:58.298
And I'm not just
talking about Jesus.

45:58.841 --> 46:02.052
I'm talking about
all organized religion,

46:03.512 --> 46:08.016
exclusive groups
created to manage control,

46:09.184 --> 46:13.355
a dealer getting people
hooked on the drug of hope,

46:13.856 --> 46:17.067
His followers
nothing but addicts

46:17.651 --> 46:20.070
who want their hit of
bullshit to keep their...

46:20.195 --> 46:22.322
Their dopamine
of ignorance,

46:22.489 --> 46:24.741
addicts afraid to
believe the truth.

46:24.992 --> 46:28.871
That there is no order,
there's no power,

46:29.663 --> 46:34.501
that all religions are just
metastasizing mind worms

46:34.877 --> 46:37.754
meant to divide us
so it's easier to rule us

46:37.880 --> 46:40.841
by the charlatans
that want to run us.

46:46.388 --> 46:50.058
All we are to them are
paying fanboys of their

46:50.392 --> 46:52.895
poorly written
sci-fi franchise.

46:56.565 --> 46:59.443
If I don't listen to
my imaginary friend,

46:59.568 --> 47:02.070
why the fuck should
I listen to yours?

47:05.908 --> 47:10.954
People think
their worship's
some key to happiness.

47:13.457 --> 47:16.752
That's just how
He owns you.

47:18.754 --> 47:21.590
Even I'm not crazy
enough to believe that

47:22.424 --> 47:24.593
distortion of reality.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.644
So fuck God.

47:36.605 --> 47:39.107
He's not a good
enough scapegoat for me.

47:51.078 --> 47:53.497
<i>Please tell me
I didn't say all of that
out loud.</i>

47:59.461 --> 48:00.837
<i>Shit. I did.</i>

48:24.027 --> 48:25.946
Angela and I are going
to have one more drink.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.868
Oh. Of course.
Of course.

48:33.662 --> 48:35.163
Thank you for
dinner, Phillip.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.042
Don't get up.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.711
It was good to
have met you.

48:41.712 --> 48:43.505
Pleasure
meeting you, Angela.

48:43.839 --> 48:46.341
Now remember,
come see us anytime.

48:46.842 --> 48:48.635
We'll have lunch.
On you.

48:55.892 --> 48:57.019
So.

48:58.186 --> 49:00.522
Did you enjoy
the Semifreddo?

49:00.856 --> 49:02.524
Was it all I promised?

49:03.483 --> 49:04.901
Yes.
Excellent!

49:05.360 --> 49:06.403
Absolutely. It was delicious.

49:06.528 --> 49:07.529
Good.

49:08.238 --> 49:09.489
And good company.

49:10.032 --> 49:12.367
Jim's been with
us for 27 years.

49:13.201 --> 49:14.703
He's a Harvard guy,
lives upstate.

49:14.870 --> 49:16.913
Three kids.
Two in college,
one in high school.

49:18.540 --> 49:20.500
Company man,
through and through.

49:20.834 --> 49:24.546
He's the reason we do our
Toys for Tots program.

49:25.714 --> 49:29.051
And Saul is the chair
of our non-profit arm.

49:30.385 --> 49:32.012
Good man as well.

49:32.721 --> 49:34.848
He has grandkids,
so he's...

49:35.599 --> 49:37.434
He's a little ahead in
the family department.

49:39.227 --> 49:41.229
And another thing
they have in common.

49:42.898 --> 49:45.567
They were both in
the room with Colby

49:46.735 --> 49:49.071
when they made
that grave error

49:50.280 --> 49:52.908
covering up
the leak in your hometown.

49:56.912 --> 49:57.954
Hmm.

50:00.248 --> 50:01.458
Ordinary men,

50:06.546 --> 50:09.925
capable of
extraordinary things.

50:18.266 --> 50:21.061
Our CFO has discovered
that within
the last two years,

50:21.144 --> 50:25.607
both Jim and Saul
have been engaged
in some nasty

50:26.441 --> 50:28.068
insider trading.

50:28.985 --> 50:30.153
Thick as thieves,
these two.

50:30.278 --> 50:33.323
They like to
buddy up on their
white-collar crimes.

50:33.448 --> 50:36.785
A regular Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

50:48.964 --> 50:51.633
There's enough
evidence in there

50:53.301 --> 50:55.303
to put them away
for years.

51:10.152 --> 51:13.822
I should get home.
Your car will be
out front.

51:17.993 --> 51:20.495
Whatever you're doing,
I don't trust it.

51:37.679 --> 51:39.222
You're panicking
right now.

51:40.682 --> 51:42.184
I understand.

51:43.560 --> 51:47.022
It's a big decision
you're making,
because these men,

51:48.190 --> 51:50.525
their lives will
be destroyed.

51:54.196 --> 51:58.366
But the minute you remove
emotion from this,

52:03.205 --> 52:05.040
you'll do just fine.

52:40.450 --> 52:41.910
Heard you had
an interesting night.

52:50.085 --> 52:51.294
Chaplain's
an old friend.

52:53.463 --> 52:55.590
I threw it out
for a reason.

52:56.383 --> 52:58.468
I figured
you might want it
for down the road.

52:59.261 --> 53:01.263
Trust me,
I've been there.

53:12.899 --> 53:15.694
Five years,
seven months,

53:15.777 --> 53:17.445
three weeks,
and two days ago,

53:18.363 --> 53:20.115
my wife passed away.

53:25.579 --> 53:28.206
A few weeks
of being frozen
in my own grief,

53:28.456 --> 53:32.419
I woke up one morning,
fixed myself breakfast
like I normally do,

53:33.044 --> 53:35.589
plugged myself into
my dialysis machine
like I normally do,

53:36.882 --> 53:39.634
and started talking,
out loud.

53:41.469 --> 53:44.931
For a second,
I thought I was crazy.
Moved on with the day.

53:45.056 --> 53:47.601
Then the next day,
I did it again.

53:48.059 --> 53:50.270
Talked out loud.
And the next.

53:51.646 --> 53:53.481
And then I realized
who I was talking to.

53:59.446 --> 54:01.948
Why are you telling me
all of this?

54:07.120 --> 54:08.163
'Cause

54:09.998 --> 54:12.834
you and me
are a lot more alike
than you think, Elliot.

54:32.854 --> 54:34.356
Are you crazy?

54:34.689 --> 54:36.691
How the hell you knocking
on my door this early?

54:37.525 --> 54:38.860
I'm sorry, Mrs. Romero.

54:38.944 --> 54:40.779
I'm Dominique DiPierro
with the FBI.

54:40.862 --> 54:43.114
I'm assisting homicide
on your son's case.

54:43.198 --> 54:45.283
I know it's early,
but I just had
a few more questions

54:45.367 --> 54:46.618
about your son's murder.

54:46.701 --> 54:47.869
I already talked
to the police!

54:54.709 --> 54:56.878
I know the cops
took all your joints.

54:58.046 --> 54:59.130
I looked through
your files.

54:59.214 --> 55:00.382
I also know
you have arthritis

55:00.507 --> 55:02.133
and probably can't
roll them yourself,

55:02.217 --> 55:04.886
so I'm guessing
your son did.

55:06.554 --> 55:09.057
I can help roll them
for you if you'd like.

55:10.183 --> 55:12.560
Used to do it all the time
for my kid brother
back in high school.

55:12.686 --> 55:15.355
He always told me
I was pretty bomb
at it.

55:26.825 --> 55:29.411
All right!
You can come on in.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.334
Hmm.

55:36.584 --> 55:38.253
Yeah, it's tight.

55:38.753 --> 55:40.171
Not perfect,

55:40.588 --> 55:42.424
but definitely doable.

55:43.341 --> 55:46.177
Yeah, it's not as fat
as my dear Leslie's.

55:47.178 --> 55:48.346
That boy wasn't
around much,

55:48.430 --> 55:50.515
but he was always
doing for me.

55:50.598 --> 55:52.892
Always. God bless him.

55:56.438 --> 55:58.106
I see you're
moving out.

55:58.231 --> 56:01.776
Yeah. I can't
stay here no more.

56:01.901 --> 56:03.278
I raised Leslie here.

56:03.611 --> 56:04.696
Huh.

56:05.071 --> 56:06.948
Too many memories here.

56:08.616 --> 56:11.369
Did he go anywhere
or do anything suspicious?

56:11.453 --> 56:12.954
Any small detail
could help.

56:13.955 --> 56:17.250
Well, he be fooling around
with those computers.
You guys know that.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.295
He always did that
since he was little.

56:20.628 --> 56:23.298
I never understood it.
Gobbledygook, if you ask me.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.801
Did he have any friends?
Did anyone ever
come to the house?

56:27.135 --> 56:28.303
Friends?

56:28.803 --> 56:30.722
Leslie didn't
have no friends,

56:31.473 --> 56:32.807
except that chubby boy.

56:37.103 --> 56:39.481
You mind if you get me...
Grab me a glass of water?

56:39.981 --> 56:41.316
Should be some
in the boxes.

56:41.483 --> 56:42.776
Oh, yeah, of course.

56:45.070 --> 56:46.905
That's right,
you told the cops
someone did come,

56:46.988 --> 56:48.239
but you didn't
see him, right?

56:48.406 --> 56:50.658
Nope, not with
these cataracts.

56:51.910 --> 56:54.496
I can barely
make you out
from my cat.

56:54.579 --> 56:56.081
Where is that thing,
anyway?

56:56.831 --> 56:58.583
Probably ran off
like everyone else.

57:05.340 --> 57:07.926
Did he say his name?
Have you seen him before?

57:08.009 --> 57:09.177
Nope.

57:10.011 --> 57:12.514
My mind was dancing
in the clouds.

57:14.099 --> 57:16.351
All I know is,
I can't live here
no more.

57:19.854 --> 57:23.358
Now that I don't owe
any more on the place
maybe I can just rent it.

57:25.693 --> 57:27.445
Yeah. Man.

57:27.862 --> 57:29.197
Besides,
I need the money.

57:42.377 --> 57:43.795
<i>...$19 million.</i>

58:03.731 --> 58:05.233
What do I do?

58:11.322 --> 58:13.867
Why did you start
writing that journal
in the first place?

58:16.327 --> 58:18.079
I thought it was
the right answer.

58:18.872 --> 58:20.165
The right answer
to what?

58:23.209 --> 58:24.919
Controlling my life.

58:31.926 --> 58:33.261
My wife,

58:34.429 --> 58:36.431
when she drove
her car that day,

58:36.931 --> 58:38.558
she did
everything right.

58:38.850 --> 58:41.603
She always wore her seat belt,
hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

58:42.604 --> 58:45.607
She was the most
perfect driver I'd ever met.

58:46.065 --> 58:48.860
It was...
It was annoying.

58:50.612 --> 58:54.532
She stayed in the lines.
Never went above or
below the speed limit.

58:55.450 --> 58:57.285
Stopped at
traffic signs.

58:57.869 --> 58:59.787
She followed
every rule.

59:03.374 --> 59:05.293
And then one day,
none of that mattered.

59:11.633 --> 59:13.134
Control is about as real

59:14.135 --> 59:16.137
as a one-legged unicorn
taking a leak

59:16.221 --> 59:17.805
at the end of
a double rainbow.

59:23.269 --> 59:25.063
Then what do we have?

59:27.440 --> 59:29.484
You know that bullshit
people say about how

59:30.652 --> 59:32.987
when you fall,
you got to get up?

59:34.948 --> 59:36.908
I reject that shit, man.

59:37.659 --> 59:38.993
You know why?

59:42.121 --> 59:44.290
The whole thing
is a fall.

59:46.501 --> 59:47.919
It can't help but be.

59:48.836 --> 59:51.506
A perpetual state of
grasping in the dark.

59:52.632 --> 59:55.677
It's not about getting up.
It's about stumbling,

59:56.177 --> 59:57.804
stumbling in
the right direction.

59:58.179 --> 1:00:00.348
It's the only true way
to move forward.

1:00:06.354 --> 1:00:08.815
Whoever it is you wrote about
in your journal,

1:00:10.483 --> 1:00:11.859
do you still see him?

1:00:20.034 --> 1:00:22.829
I can tell the person
you're writing about
meant something to you.

1:00:24.163 --> 1:00:26.124
Sometimes he takes over?

1:00:27.041 --> 1:00:28.668
That's why you don't
remember things?

1:00:29.711 --> 1:00:31.963
I shouldn't have come.
I don't want to
talk about this.

1:00:32.046 --> 1:00:33.214
Yes, you do.

1:00:36.009 --> 1:00:37.719
'Cause you're smart enough
to know that

1:00:37.802 --> 1:00:40.555
keeping this inside
isn't going to last.

1:00:45.643 --> 1:00:46.686
You play chess?

1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:52.317
I've been looking
for a good adversary.
Want to play?

1:01:11.753 --> 1:01:12.920
<i>What do you think?</i>

1:01:15.882 --> 1:01:17.342
<i>Is Ray right?</i>

1:01:20.178 --> 1:01:22.722
<i>Maybe it's not about
avoiding the crash.</i>

1:01:26.392 --> 1:01:29.687
<i>But it's about setting
a break-point to find
the flaw in the code,</i>

1:01:29.771 --> 1:01:32.732
<i>fix it, and carry on
until we hit the next flaw.</i>

1:01:33.524 --> 1:01:35.443
<i>The quest to keep going,</i>

1:01:36.402 --> 1:01:38.571
<i>to always fight for footing.</i>

1:01:43.576 --> 1:01:46.287
<i>Maybe we're all
just stumbling from
the right questions</i>

1:01:46.412 --> 1:01:47.789
<i>to the wrong answers.</i>

1:01:49.457 --> 1:01:52.043
<i>Or from the right answers
to the wrong questions.</i>

1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:57.048
<i>It doesn't matter where you go
or where you come from,</i>

1:01:59.300 --> 1:02:01.219
<i>as long as you keep stumbling.</i>

1:02:03.971 --> 1:02:05.932
<i>Maybe that's all it takes.</i>

1:02:06.724 --> 1:02:08.768
<i>Maybe that's as
good as it gets.</i>

1:02:11.813 --> 1:02:13.981
You got to be
fucking kidding me.
