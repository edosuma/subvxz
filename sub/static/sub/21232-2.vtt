00:17.017 --> 00:19.019
[crickets chirping]

00:19.102 --> 00:20.979
[theme music playing]

00:22.231 --> 00:23.774
[spits]

00:23.857 --> 00:28.111
It's all about these old families,
like the Belmonts,

00:28.195 --> 00:32.449
who control all the power
and go to war with each other.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.660
And who's caught in the middle?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.954
- We are.
- We are!

00:37.037 --> 00:39.998
Because we don't matter.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.750
Do you know why?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.543
Where'd you come from?

00:43.627 --> 00:45.629
Well, out of your aunt, according to you.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.381
You came from shit.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.299
I came from shit.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.261
We all came from shit.

00:52.344 --> 00:56.431
We just work for a living
every day of our lives.

00:56.515 --> 01:00.852
We just keep those bastards
in food and wool.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.897
Slaves! That's what we are.

01:04.481 --> 01:08.277
Slaves to great old families
and their games.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.196
Sorry. Can I get my ale?

01:11.280 --> 01:13.824
It's just that I think I'm sobering up.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.536
All right, all right, but wanna see
some coin from you now.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.745
[groans]

01:22.374 --> 01:24.793
[clanking]

01:24.876 --> 01:26.628
Ohh.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.255
Huh.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.632
[clinking]

01:30.716 --> 01:33.885
[Bosha]
Hey, what's that on your chest?

01:33.969 --> 01:36.388
Oh... my shirt.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.807
Just one more tankard, eh?

01:38.890 --> 01:43.145
Something to keep me warm
while I find a tree to sleep under.

01:43.228 --> 01:47.274
That's a family crest. I know it.

01:47.357 --> 01:51.862
I don't. Just one more drink
and then I'll leave, all right?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.281
That's a Belmont crest.

01:54.364 --> 01:58.410
Really? Look, here's the money.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.328
[coins clink]

01:59.411 --> 02:01.330
[Bosha] You're a Belmont, aren't you?

02:01.413 --> 02:05.375
House of Belmont, Family Belmont!

02:05.459 --> 02:06.793
Never met them.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.962
Listen, just forget it.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.172
I'll just go.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.549
No! You're a Belmont!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.551
This is all your fault.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.471
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.306
[Kob]
Yes, you do.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.059
[Bosha] Yes, you do.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.355
Everyone knows the Belmonts
dealt in black magic.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.274
The Belmonts dealt with monsters.

02:29.358 --> 02:34.738
The Belmonts fought monsters,
son... so I'm told.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.240
This is just an old shirt.

02:37.324 --> 02:41.370
The Belmonts
were excommunicated by the church,

02:41.453 --> 02:43.955
banished, disowned,

02:44.039 --> 02:48.251
their lands taken because they were evil.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.753
Evil.

02:49.836 --> 02:53.173
And now Dracula's hordes
are abroad in the land.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.884
And whose fault is that?

02:55.967 --> 02:57.511
Well, it ain't mine.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.430
The Belmonts traded in black magic,

03:00.514 --> 03:04.184
and now black magic is all over Wallachia.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.646
I think you know exactly
whose fault that is.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.233
I'm leaving, okay?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.777
I'm leaving now.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.072
So you can lead
your monster friends back here?

03:17.155 --> 03:20.242
So I can find somewhere to piss
and somewhere else to sleep.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.744
No, you can sleep right here.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.123
- You haven't got your shovel.
- [both grunt]

03:27.833 --> 03:28.834
I don't need it.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.379
Confess, and I'll make it quick.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.214
What's your name?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.049
Jesus of Nazareth.

03:36.133 --> 03:41.012
Look, I'm carrying
a short sword and a whip.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.514
[groans]

03:42.597 --> 03:44.141
Try again.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.352
Trevor Belmont. House of Belmont.

03:47.436 --> 03:51.481
Last son of the Belmont family.
Happy now?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.650
No. [grunts]

03:54.359 --> 03:56.611
Unh! Ooh.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.864
Ooh, oh, whoa!

03:58.947 --> 04:00.866
- [grunts]
- Oi!

04:05.370 --> 04:07.164
Fucking face down here!

04:20.469 --> 04:23.013
That's how you want it? Listen.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.515
I used to fight fucking vampires.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.850
Unh!

04:29.895 --> 04:30.979
Kick him!

04:31.062 --> 04:32.564
[chuckles, grunts]

04:33.273 --> 04:34.274
[whimper]

04:37.068 --> 04:40.739
Would you please leave
my testicles alone? Ugh!

04:44.075 --> 04:45.327
[screams]

04:45.911 --> 04:46.911
Hey!

04:46.953 --> 04:49.498
[groaning]

04:52.959 --> 04:54.920
I'm Trevor fucking Belmont,

04:55.003 --> 04:58.632
and I've never lost a fight
to man nor fucking beast.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.051
Oh!

05:01.134 --> 05:03.720
[laughing]

05:03.804 --> 05:04.846
Oh, shit.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.723
[grunting]

05:06.807 --> 05:09.351
[wings flapping]

05:10.143 --> 05:11.186
[groans]

05:14.606 --> 05:16.233
Oh, Christ.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.654
[vomiting]

05:23.824 --> 05:24.825
Bastards.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.828
I hope you all bleed out.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.164
Through your arses!

05:31.248 --> 05:35.752
Mm... every last rat bastard one of you.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.552
[crows cawing]

05:46.596 --> 05:49.266
[sighs, gasps]

05:50.600 --> 05:52.477
[groans]

05:54.312 --> 05:55.313
Oh.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.108
Oh.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.027
Bloody Gresit.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.282
Last stop between me and starvation.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.743
The next town's 40 bloody miles away.

06:09.744 --> 06:10.954
[groans]

06:11.997 --> 06:14.749
[goblins screeching]

06:14.833 --> 06:15.834
[grunts]

06:17.794 --> 06:20.130
[growling]

06:21.256 --> 06:24.926
[woman screaming]

06:38.064 --> 06:39.816
Here we go.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.736
Hmm.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.699
No one's getting in,
and no one's getting out.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.496
Pretty sure they wouldn't do that
just to deny me breakfast.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.468
Hmm.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.470
[water gurgling]

07:08.553 --> 07:09.554
[grunts]

07:15.477 --> 07:16.478
Whoa.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.105
[grunts]

07:20.774 --> 07:23.401
[water rushing]

07:27.030 --> 07:31.242
God forbid you should warn anyone
before emptying your fucking shit pots.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.912
[grunts]

07:38.750 --> 07:40.001
Never thought I'd be so hungry

07:40.085 --> 07:42.629
I'd climb a shit pipe
in pursuit of breakfast.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.547
Oh, never mind.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.520
[guard snoring]

07:58.603 --> 08:00.021
[Trevor chuckles]

08:09.531 --> 08:12.283
[wind gusting]

08:42.605 --> 08:45.025
[flies buzzing]

08:46.943 --> 08:48.028
[spits]

08:51.406 --> 08:54.325
[crowd chatters]

08:58.747 --> 09:00.832
[grunts]

09:09.257 --> 09:10.675
[vomit splatters]

09:22.103 --> 09:24.189
What will one coin buy me?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.149
Bit of dried goat.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.318
Haven't seen you before.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.153
I'm just passing through.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.780
I'll take it, thanks.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.823
You want to pass through quicker.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.201
Yeah, I guess you've got
some troubles here.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.827
Is there a defense effort?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.915
Don't need it. We got a tribe
of Speakers in the city.

09:41.998 --> 09:46.461
Once we've done what needs to be done,
the demons will leave us alone.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.639
[no audible dialogue]

10:04.187 --> 10:06.481
[no audible dialogue]

10:06.564 --> 10:10.151
There's an old story,
the Sleeping Soldier.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.196
They say he was a great hero
hundreds of years ago,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.782
but now he sleep under the catacombs.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.534
Hmm, what for?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.036
To wait until he's needed again,
of course.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.955
I think he'll come back.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.123
Really?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.708
Oh, yes, but keep it quiet.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.128
The new bishop hates the old wisdom.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.421
Dracula's monsters come at night,

10:30.505 --> 10:33.091
but the bishop's men come
in the middle of the day.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.843
You know what I mean?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.344
You know what I think?

10:36.427 --> 10:39.097
I think the Speakers
make the Sleeping Soldier ill.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.559
We have no defenses,
so of course Dracula's bastards

10:42.642 --> 10:44.185
come over the wall every night.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.688
The bishop will sort things out.

10:46.771 --> 10:51.276
This city has, not to put
too fine a point on it, gone to hell.

10:51.359 --> 10:56.239
If the others will just do as he says
when he tells us to do it,

10:56.322 --> 10:58.241
then all will be in order.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.708
[eerie music playing]

11:13.464 --> 11:17.135
I warned you.
You can't say I didn't warn you.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.262
You did not listen to me, sir.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.389
Are you talking back to me?

11:21.472 --> 11:23.725
No, I'm merely talking to you.

11:23.808 --> 11:28.521
Anyone can see that we are not responsible
for what befalls Gresit.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.189
No, keep walking.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.400
So, now I'm stupid?

11:32.483 --> 11:37.864
I work within the light of God Himself,
but you can see things I can't

11:37.947 --> 11:39.490
with your magic?

11:39.574 --> 11:43.995
There's no magic, sir.
We are here to help, that's all.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.039
Speakers don't help.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.042
Speakers are tainted.
You attract evil,

11:49.125 --> 11:53.046
and you and yours were told
to be out of Gresit by sunset.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.799
And see? The sun is up.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.178
Take a good look at the sunrise, old man.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.848
[sighs]

12:04.974 --> 12:08.978
Will killing an old man
make you less scared of the dark?

12:09.062 --> 12:13.149
I don't know.
Maybe it will just make me feel better.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.079
[groans, pants]

12:26.162 --> 12:28.539
Oh, hell. I'm sorry.

12:28.623 --> 12:31.626
I was trying to snatch the stave
out of your hand. How's your finger?

12:31.709 --> 12:33.378
What fucking finger?!

12:33.461 --> 12:35.588
That's no way for a man
of the cloth to talk.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.840
Why don't you go and get that looked at?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.342
Kill the bastard!

12:39.425 --> 12:42.887
Look, I don't like priests
at the best of times.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.598
I mean, I really, really
don't like priests.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.267
If you leave now,
we'll say no more about it.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.103
Kill him now!

12:50.186 --> 12:52.522
Last warning. This will get nasty.

12:57.819 --> 13:01.197
Oh, now, that's a funny thing
for a priest to be carrying.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.408
That's a thief's knife.

13:04.409 --> 13:09.038
Seriously? I'm out of practice,
but I'm stone-cold sober.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.665
Someone will get hurt.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.128
[grunting]

13:31.686 --> 13:33.771
[screaming]

13:39.068 --> 13:42.030
Pick him up.
Take him back to your church.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.658
Don't bother this man
or his people again.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.499
The violence wasn't necessary, sir.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.626
But... [chuckles]

13:55.710 --> 13:57.253
it is appreciated.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.382
I am the elder of the Codrii Speakers.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.259
Thank you for your kindness

14:03.342 --> 14:06.220
and, I think, your restraint.

14:06.304 --> 14:11.267
You're welcome, Elder.
Can I accompany you to your train?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.227
We have settled here in Gresit.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.021
No caravans.

14:15.104 --> 14:19.359
But I would be glad of your company
on the way to our lodging.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
How many are you?

14:23.321 --> 14:27.575
Eleven, though I insist
we be counted as 12.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.745
One of us is missing, you see.

14:32.205 --> 14:38.169
This is where we live.
Please, come inside. Meet my people.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.384
Elder, we were worried about you.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.886
I told you it was too soon to go outdoors.

14:46.969 --> 14:51.224
And I told you it was necessary
to offer aid to the people.

14:51.307 --> 14:55.269
However, I was met by some
of the Christian priests.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.979
Are you all right?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.856
Thanks to this man.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.360
Although I fear there may be
trouble ahead because of it.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.528
What did you do?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.196
I'm a little out of practice.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.739
They're both still alive.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.200
You used violence on them?

15:10.410 --> 15:14.872
The younger people believe
that words can speak louder than actions.

15:14.956 --> 15:18.709
Well, you're Speakers.
Words are what you do.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.002
You know of us?

15:20.086 --> 15:23.047
My family's always been
on good terms with Speakers,

15:23.131 --> 15:25.258
although my father
once got into a fight with one.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.260
True Speakers do not fight.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.303
When he tried to convince a Speaker

15:29.387 --> 15:32.223
to have your oral history
transcribed on paper.

15:33.057 --> 15:37.270
Ah, yes, we are
quite protective of our ways.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.107
History is a living thing.
Paper is dead.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.567
Would you like something to eat?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.694
I'd prefer something to drink.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.696
Arn, bring our friend some water.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.699
Oh, the... never mind, then.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.452
Maybe you can just tell me
why you're here.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.496
Speakers live anywhere they deem right.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.248
You must know that.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.834
I know Speakers are nomadic tribes.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.919
You seem to have been here a while.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.337
And how do you know that?

16:03.421 --> 16:05.965
Because the locals are blaming you
for the attacks.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.302
That's the church's doing.
They need something to blame.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.888
To divert people from the truth,

16:11.971 --> 16:16.267
that the church itself brought
Dracula's hordes down on the land.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.393
Really?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.271
There were Speakers
in Targoviste one year ago.

16:20.354 --> 16:24.692
The church burned Dracula's wife
at the stake as a witch.

16:24.775 --> 16:25.776
Shit.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.196
That is indeed one way of putting it.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.615
But you didn't answer my question.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.167
There is no structure
left in Gresit.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.794
No doctors, no aid.

16:43.878 --> 16:49.133
If you know Speakers, then you know
we can't turn away from those in need.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.385
That is why we are here.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.054
May as well tell him the rest.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.223
[sighs]

16:55.306 --> 16:58.726
In Speaker history,
there is an old story,

16:58.809 --> 17:00.728
a legend, probably.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.438
I like stories.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.067
The story says that a savior
sleeps under Gresit,

17:06.150 --> 17:09.529
a great hero who sleeps
until he is needed,

17:09.612 --> 17:13.157
until there is a darkness upon the land.

17:13.241 --> 17:17.203
Oh, I heard that one.
The Sleeping Soldier.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.579
It's a local legend.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.457
Sounds weirdly convenient to me,
if you know what I mean.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.293
Exactly how much
do you know about this, sir?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.670
I'm a Belmont...

17:27.046 --> 17:29.924
so I know you're a nomadic people
who gather knowledge,

17:30.007 --> 17:33.636
memorize it, carry complete
spoken histories with you.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.847
I also know you gather hidden knowledge

17:36.931 --> 17:39.725
and have practitioners
of magic knowledge in your tribes.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.937
A Belmont? I thought
your family had vanished.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.399
If vanished is the polite way
of saying exiled, hated,

17:46.482 --> 17:48.776
and burned out of
the ancestral home, then...

17:48.859 --> 17:51.028
Then you know something of magic,

17:51.696 --> 17:55.825
and so you know that
just because we found a story in our past,

17:55.908 --> 17:58.411
it doesn't mean it originated there.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.747
The wisest and cleverest of our magicians

18:01.831 --> 18:05.001
know that dying is not absolute,

18:05.084 --> 18:08.629
that it is possible
to hear stories from the future.

18:08.713 --> 18:12.883
So, you think there's someone
that can save the city asleep under it,

18:12.967 --> 18:14.510
and you're here to wait for him?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.596
One of us went to look for him.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.265
This would be your "missing" Speaker?

18:19.348 --> 18:25.187
Yes. That one went into the catacombs
under the mausoleum west of the church.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.856
Has not returned.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.358
Isn't there a head man
in Gresit you could go to?

18:29.442 --> 18:32.194
He died in the first horde attack.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.572
Our searches have been unsuccessful.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.117
So, what are your plans?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.703
Find some more food,
find some drink,

18:40.786 --> 18:42.913
get drunk, eat some food, move on.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.374
- That's it?
- Maybe find a tall tree,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.336
sit in it, watch the show
before I move on,

18:48.419 --> 18:53.049
all the good little people
dying horribly, all that.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.051
You feel no compassion?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.637
This is what the church wanted.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.182
My family were the only people
who could've fought Dracula and his army,

19:01.265 --> 19:02.683
but they didn't want us.

19:02.767 --> 19:06.604
They wanted to fight the darkness
on their own terms, good luck to them.

19:06.687 --> 19:11.192
But the ordinary people of Wallachia,
they didn't get the choice.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.237
For evil bastards to win power,
all ordinary people have to do

19:15.321 --> 19:18.407
is stand aside and keep quiet.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.284
There's always a choice.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.871
Well, find a good tall tree.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.998
You can watch us die, too.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.626
Don't be crazy. Leave now.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.170
Head south,
hook up with another train.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.922
- It's his grandchild.
- Arn!

19:33.005 --> 19:36.425
I don't care!
It's the elder's grandchild down there.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.928
We can't even bury them.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.972
It's not our way to just leave
our dead unattended to!

19:42.056 --> 19:45.142
We stay for the people of Gresit.

19:45.226 --> 19:50.940
Yes, we do. But we also stay
because we hope...

19:51.023 --> 19:53.359
So, you're staying to die
with the good people of Gresit,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.083
not just because it's a good thing to do,

19:55.111 --> 19:57.321
but because you don't have
your grandchild's body?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.700
If you want to put it that way.

20:07.498 --> 20:11.627
If I go and recover your kid's body,
will you please leave?

20:12.336 --> 20:13.713
Wait outside the city.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.674
Give your aid to the survivors
when the night horde

20:16.757 --> 20:19.135
finally just rips through this place.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
Why would you do that?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.889
They're going to come for you soon.

20:23.973 --> 20:28.102
The good people. It's gonna be a pogrom.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.604
They were talking about it
in the marketplace this morning.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.773
I don't think you answered my question.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.234
I know what it's like to be persecuted

20:35.317 --> 20:37.820
by your own country
for the accident of your birth.

20:37.903 --> 20:43.451
If I find your grandchild,
will you leave this city before nightfall?

20:44.535 --> 20:49.165
If that is the condition
of your recovering, then yes.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.249
[knuckles crack]

20:53.294 --> 20:54.837
I'm leaving now.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.548
Don't go walkabouts looking
for people to give support to.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.509
- Stay right here.
- Belmont.

21:01.927 --> 21:05.389
It is not dying that frightens us.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.809
It's living without ever
having done our best.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.312
I don't care.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.068
[wind gusting]

22:36.188 --> 22:37.731
[high-pitched voice]
<i>Frederator!</i>
