WEBVTT

00:00.819 --> 00:03.549
I'm just saying,
Milk does the booty good.

00:03.556 --> 00:06.456
Really?
'Cause I got a good booty.

00:06.459 --> 00:09.459
- Oh, a drone.
- What the [bleep]?

00:09.462 --> 00:11.902
I was just about to smash, too.

00:15.234 --> 00:16.634
Y'all dudes from Devry High

00:16.635 --> 00:17.895
better stop
taking all our beezys.

00:17.903 --> 00:21.913
<i>What can I say, ese?
Hoes love drones, holmes.</i>

00:21.948 --> 00:23.107
Hey, man, [bleep] Devry.

00:23.108 --> 00:25.538
Hey, fellas,
it's election season.

00:25.544 --> 00:27.261
I hope I can
count on your vote.

00:27.296 --> 00:28.979
[bleep] no.
Last time I voted,

00:28.981 --> 00:32.250
- Fantasia lost.
- Well, all righty.

00:33.452 --> 00:35.352
What kind of lame
would want to run

00:35.354 --> 00:37.685
for Class President?
You know he don't get no ass.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.423
Hey, Craigery,
love your feminist platform.

00:39.458 --> 00:42.528
It would be so awesome
to have a women's history class.

00:42.563 --> 00:45.228
I think we need women's lit,
feminist science,

00:45.231 --> 00:47.561
and CLAM,
Clitoris Awareness Month.

00:47.566 --> 00:50.766
I'd love to hear more.
We should do lunch.

00:50.769 --> 00:52.599
Yo, homey,
you need to make a move.

00:52.605 --> 00:56.373
President Skidmark 'bout to
beat you to Cindy's ballot box.

00:56.975 --> 00:58.935
Excuse me, everybody,
I'd like to announce

00:58.944 --> 01:01.447
my candidacy

01:03.985 --> 01:05.081
Ya'll hear that?
They love me.

01:05.117 --> 01:07.077
Your boy's going to be
president real soon.

01:07.086 --> 01:10.786

Inaugural Balling Party?
Since when are you into politics?

03:09.828 --> 03:11.928
Since he thought
he could get in that ass.

03:12.598 --> 03:13.858
There's plenty
you don't know about me,

03:13.866 --> 03:15.650
but don't trip, once I'm prez,

03:15.685 --> 03:17.718
I'm going to debrief myself,
then debrief you.

03:17.753 --> 03:20.103
You ain't debriefing nothing
if you don't win

03:20.105 --> 03:23.065
- that debate tomorrow.
- Oh, I'll be president.

03:23.075 --> 03:24.135
Trust and believe.

03:24.142 --> 03:26.682
And what makes you think
you're going to win?

03:26.717 --> 03:29.546
Ain't no way we losing to a
mark ass nerd like you, Mark.

03:29.548 --> 03:31.778
Well the polls don't
think I'm a mark.

03:31.783 --> 03:35.723
I belive you basketball players
refer to this as a blow out.

03:35.758 --> 03:39.921
In your face.
Boom shakalaka, bitch!

03:41.193 --> 03:43.593
- Come on, Cindy.
- You tell 'em, Craigery.

03:43.595 --> 03:45.595
Damn, my nig,
according to the polls,

03:45.597 --> 03:48.767
you're ahead of nobody
and behind Deez Nutz.

03:48.802 --> 03:52.137
That makes you
an asshole, my dude.

03:55.773 --> 03:57.274
Oregano, where you going?

03:57.309 --> 03:59.843
I ain't Oregano no more.
I'm Susan.

03:59.878 --> 04:03.678
- I'm going to Devry High.
- Ooh, I heard of Devry,

04:03.682 --> 04:06.082
but ain't you got to be able to
read and write to go there?

04:06.084 --> 04:09.224
That's what I thunk,
but they'll learn you everything

04:09.259 --> 04:11.608
and now I can see my kids
at night.

04:11.643 --> 04:13.957
I would love to see
my kids at night.

04:13.959 --> 04:16.289
Then get your ass down
to Devry High.

04:16.295 --> 04:20.625
They'll turn that golden shower
into a golden parachute.

04:20.632 --> 04:23.602
<i>Devry High.
See your kids at night.</i>

04:23.637 --> 04:26.402
These marks at Devry
trying to do a hoe upgrade.

04:26.405 --> 04:29.272
Shit, I ran for president to
get some ass, not become one.

04:29.274 --> 04:30.958
- Maybe I should quit.
- Never that.

04:30.993 --> 04:32.642
We ain't no quitters, we legends.

04:32.644 --> 04:35.554
If we put our heads together
and figure out a strategy,

04:35.589 --> 04:38.247
we going to get that
come from behind vote.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.082
What's this I hear about a
certain negro running for office?

04:41.086 --> 04:43.854
That's right, and when I win,
you could be my First Little Bruh.

04:43.889 --> 04:46.669
Well, let me be the first little
brother to tell you that American

04:46.670 --> 04:49.159
politics is a game built on a
foundation that's meant to keep

04:49.194 --> 04:51.427
- the Black man down.
- What about Barack O-beezy?

04:51.430 --> 04:54.200
Obama knew the game.
He did what populous politicians

04:54.235 --> 04:55.132
always do,
tell the people

04:55.167 --> 04:56.897
what they want to hear
to please everybody,

04:56.902 --> 04:58.302
then catch amnesia
when they get elected.

04:58.303 --> 05:00.703
Negro, you think we're going
to forget about tax reform

05:00.706 --> 05:02.566
just because you sang
"Amazing Grace"?

05:02.574 --> 05:03.674
Hey, Barry do got bars.

05:03.675 --> 05:06.075
I just want to be president,
throw a legendary party

05:06.078 --> 05:09.248
and see what the inside
of Cindy's panties smell like.

05:09.283 --> 05:13.549
You guys are the reason
they don't think Black lives matter.

05:14.018 --> 05:16.188
<i> I think we should have
ottomans for the benchwarmers,</i>

05:16.223 --> 05:19.488
<i>Gatorade instead of Flavor Aid,
and last but not least,</i>

05:19.491 --> 05:21.024
baby wipes
in the boy's locker room.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.793
That's the dumbest shit
I've ever heard.

05:22.828 --> 05:26.598
Everyone knows a real man
lets his ass clean itself.

05:29.601 --> 05:30.233
Next question.

05:30.268 --> 05:34.398
So, Craigery, if I text
my friend an answer to a test,

05:34.406 --> 05:36.306
- is that cheating?
- You know what's really cheating?

05:36.341 --> 05:39.711
Cheating women out
of an opportunity to be heard,

05:39.746 --> 05:42.751
so I say
text away, girlfriend!

05:43.982 --> 05:46.482
Hey, he good.
That boy real good.

05:46.485 --> 05:50.045
Rochella, with the recent rise
in band member assaults,

05:50.055 --> 05:51.445
what are you prepared to do

05:51.456 --> 05:54.616
to ensure these valuable
artists are protected?

05:54.626 --> 05:57.486
Well, the first thing
I'ma do is this.

05:58.563 --> 06:00.203
You like that, huh?

06:00.238 --> 06:02.829
Oh, Grove.
Craigery got the vagina vote,

06:02.834 --> 06:05.399
Rochella got the dick vote,
and Deez got the nut vote.

06:05.404 --> 06:07.904
If you lose this,
there's no party.

06:07.906 --> 06:09.566
No party, no Cindy.

06:09.574 --> 06:12.544
<i>Milk's right.
Okay, Grover, get it together.</i>

06:12.579 --> 06:13.243
<i> You're losing.</i>

06:13.278 --> 06:15.108
<i> Now, what was that smart shit
Malik said?</i>

06:15.113 --> 06:17.753
I said you can't please
everybody, negro.

06:17.788 --> 06:20.103
That's it.
Negro, please everybody.

06:20.138 --> 06:22.418
No, that's not what I said, Grover.

06:22.421 --> 06:24.705
No, that is what you said.
I was there.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.989
What are you doing?
Grover. Grover.

06:26.992 --> 06:29.362
<i>Grover! Grover!</i>

06:29.397 --> 06:31.458
- Huh?
- Please answer the question.

06:31.463 --> 06:33.831
Ms. Nobel, all of
these questions is cool,

06:33.866 --> 06:36.199
but what the people
really want to know is

06:36.201 --> 06:37.701
what can we do for them?

06:38.670 --> 06:41.102
- What you gon' do, Grover?
- I'ma tell you.

06:41.106 --> 06:43.236
To my band members,
you want to stop assaults?

06:43.241 --> 06:45.582
Shit, do it.
You the ones holding the brass.

06:45.617 --> 06:47.477
Now beat somebody's ass.

06:51.854 --> 06:54.847
And to my LGBT EFG LMNOPs,

06:54.853 --> 06:56.353
President Grover
supports the rainbow.

06:56.388 --> 07:00.358
Skittles is my favorite fruit,
and so are you.

07:00.393 --> 07:02.358
Let me see your dick.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.100
And to my lovely loose hoes
over there,

07:05.135 --> 07:05.757
Grover got you.

07:05.764 --> 07:08.004
I'm bringing Planned
Parenthood to the school.

07:08.039 --> 07:10.427
That's right. I'ma hold
you down like a white cop

07:10.435 --> 07:12.235
at a black pool party.

07:14.606 --> 07:16.066
That's why I [bleep] with him.

07:16.074 --> 07:17.941
Girl, you [bleep] with everybody.

07:17.976 --> 07:19.809
The point is, once I'm elected,

07:19.811 --> 07:21.641
I'ma be
everybody's president.

07:21.646 --> 07:25.666
If you got a problem,
I'll solve it. Ya heard?

07:27.152 --> 07:29.392
Who you know fresher than Grove?

07:31.890 --> 07:32.622
My boy is back.

07:32.657 --> 07:35.941
We about to get
some throats pregnant.

07:36.945 --> 07:38.810
- You the man, Grover!
- Hey, Mr. President.

07:38.815 --> 07:42.317
I could get used to this
presidential motorcade, my dudes.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.250
Jamal, if you finna keep
co-heading my secret swervice,

07:47.256 --> 07:49.988
- you need to step it up.
- But my dogs is howling.

07:49.993 --> 07:52.533
What say we
half-step it a beat, my nigs?

07:52.568 --> 07:53.558
Aye, how come we can't get

07:53.563 --> 07:57.063
no alternative forms
of transportation in this bitch?

07:57.066 --> 07:59.301
- Some Heelys or something.
- If we all ridin' presidential,

07:59.302 --> 08:01.472
how they gon' know
I'm more important than y'all?

08:01.507 --> 08:05.671
Now I need y'all
to watch my back.

08:05.675 --> 08:06.665
Ah, my dude.

08:06.676 --> 08:09.076
And my front.
Thanks, dawg.

08:09.078 --> 08:11.978
I don't know if doing
all this ass kissing

08:11.981 --> 08:14.381
just to go to a party
is worth it.

08:15.151 --> 08:16.181
You blasphemizing, Jamal.

08:16.185 --> 08:19.815
Partying with potential ass
is always worth it.

08:20.023 --> 08:22.384
Look, it's Sloppy Jose day, so you know

08:22.385 --> 08:24.987
them ESL marks be
flocking like cucarachas.

08:24.994 --> 08:29.226
A little sensitivity, my dudes.
Those cucarachas all vote.

08:29.232 --> 08:31.281
<i>Good to see you.
Hola. Hola.</i>

08:31.316 --> 08:33.330
<i> Konichiwa.

Mind if I jump in?

08:34.102 --> 08:37.243
I can't work as hard for y'all
on an empty stomach.

08:37.278 --> 08:38.072
Yo, that was ballin'.

08:38.107 --> 08:40.067
You can't be eating
with the president.

08:40.076 --> 08:41.676
- Why not?
- 'Cause if you eating,

08:41.711 --> 08:44.051
who gonna be watching
the presidential backside?

08:44.086 --> 08:45.707
This nigga.

08:45.835 --> 08:46.865
Okay, you know the drill.

08:46.869 --> 08:50.139
When you're done,
place the Scantron on my desk.

08:50.174 --> 08:51.669
Then you can leave or stay.

08:51.674 --> 08:55.514
I... I don't...
I don't give a...

08:55.549 --> 08:56.144
Oh, shit.

08:56.179 --> 08:58.109
Ms. Noble just gave me
the answer to the test.

08:58.114 --> 08:59.914
- Say what, my nig?
- I'm the president.

08:59.949 --> 09:02.279
You think they'd let me
fail a history test?

09:02.285 --> 09:03.979
Aye, real talk.
That's gangsterer than a mug.

09:03.986 --> 09:08.156
Yep, these presidential perks
ain't nothin' to [bleep] with.

09:08.157 --> 09:11.990
- We all finna get them As. Hey!
- Aye, fall back, Jamal.

09:12.025 --> 09:14.556
- Say what again, my nig?
- This is classified information,

09:14.564 --> 09:16.664
and I ain't trying
to get caught up in no scandal,

09:16.666 --> 09:18.466
unless it's
with Kerry Washington.

09:18.467 --> 09:22.597

09:27.577 --> 09:32.177

Monica Boo-inskys?

09:37.826 --> 09:39.687
Thanks again, Mr. President.

09:39.689 --> 09:43.219
What's going on, my n...
uh, fellow Americans?

09:43.226 --> 09:44.900
You tell us.
I know you didn't just

09:44.901 --> 09:46.685
experience that trilogy
without your boys.

09:46.696 --> 09:48.496
Yeah, you coulda at least
let us watch.

09:48.497 --> 09:50.127
You old, greedy-ass filibuster.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.702
This was
official presidential business.

09:52.737 --> 09:53.434
Politics as usual.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.099
You letting this shit
go to your head, Grove.

09:55.104 --> 09:58.444
You forgetting about the people
who got you here, my nig.

09:58.479 --> 09:59.905
- Ow!
- I can't believe this, man.

09:59.909 --> 10:01.639
You gonna big-time us
like you LeBron

10:01.644 --> 10:04.284
and we ain't nothing
but some Dellavedovas?

10:04.319 --> 10:05.210
Is this where we at?

10:05.214 --> 10:06.968
Somebody got to get
the loose balls.

10:07.003 --> 10:08.722
I got some loose balls
for you, homey.

10:08.757 --> 10:09.678
Look, we getting off track.

10:09.685 --> 10:11.615
The people on my dick,
why ain't y'all?

10:11.621 --> 10:14.522
- 'Cause we ain't no dick riders.
- Aye, you playing yourself

10:14.557 --> 10:16.824
if you think we gon'
play that part. We quits.

10:16.859 --> 10:20.301
<i>Yeah, you can ride your own dick.</i>

10:24.033 --> 10:25.733
Mr. President,
Cindy's here to see you

10:25.735 --> 10:29.035
and she smells
like she' not wearing panties.

10:29.038 --> 10:30.268
Cindy? Hold on.

10:30.273 --> 10:31.573
<i>Just give me a second here.</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:35.539
<i>Send her in.</i>

10:35.544 --> 10:36.344
Mr. President?
Ew.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.745
What's Gucci, boo?
How can I service you?

10:38.748 --> 10:40.578
Why you in your
little brother's drawls?

10:40.583 --> 10:41.415
The real question is,

10:41.450 --> 10:43.350
why aren't you
in my little brother's drawls?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.986
I ain't got time
for your foolishness.

10:45.021 --> 10:47.221
Have you considered our
Cliterature Studies proposal?

10:47.223 --> 10:50.063
Naw, sorry.
I ain't got time for that.

10:50.098 --> 10:51.905
As you can see, I'm
still trying to figure

10:51.906 --> 10:53.796
out what to wear to my
inaugural Ballin' Ball.

10:53.831 --> 10:55.499
What's more presidential?

10:55.534 --> 10:56.758
Orange or tangerine?

10:56.766 --> 10:58.626
You didn't get
elected to party.

10:58.634 --> 11:00.934
I thought you
was different, Grover.

11:00.936 --> 11:01.696
All right, fine.

11:01.704 --> 11:05.274
I'll go to student council
and take care of it.

11:08.644 --> 11:10.761
So you want Cliterature Studies,

11:10.796 --> 11:12.879
trench coats and guns
for the goths,

11:12.882 --> 11:15.977
abortions for the whores,
and you want a fundraiser

11:15.985 --> 11:18.585
to find out who killed Big Pun?

11:18.587 --> 11:20.247
Inquiring nigs want to know.

11:20.256 --> 11:24.189
Brah, everybody knows it
was Little Debbie. Denied.

11:24.193 --> 11:26.393
Damn, I can't make good
on any of my promises.

11:26.395 --> 11:29.355
Last time I checked, I was
the president around this bitch.

11:29.365 --> 11:32.495
The student body president
has very little power.

11:32.501 --> 11:36.041
He's like an executive producer
of his first TV show.

11:36.076 --> 11:38.908
It's just a title
they have to give him, really.

11:38.943 --> 11:40.068
Nobody expects much from him.

11:40.076 --> 11:43.706
Word on the street is Cindy's
been coming by your office.

11:43.713 --> 11:44.413
Is that true?

11:44.448 --> 11:46.683
Yep, she also been
coming inside my office.

11:46.718 --> 11:47.815
What the [bleep] did you just say?

11:47.850 --> 11:50.080
All I'm saying is,
I'm not just president.

11:50.086 --> 11:52.486
I'm also the secretary
of her interior.

11:52.488 --> 11:55.122
- You son of a bitch!
- Man, this is some ridiculous

11:55.157 --> 11:56.357
punk-ass bullsnip right here,
Randy.

11:56.359 --> 11:57.619
You gonna go just let him
get away with?

11:57.626 --> 12:00.186
The shit crew
ain't gettin' away with shit.

12:00.196 --> 12:04.096
Our next order of business,
the phantom shitter is back.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.103
What?
Aw, hell no!

12:08.205 --> 12:10.370
Aye, what happened to our
Mexican history month, ese?

12:10.373 --> 12:13.743
Showing "La Bamba"
on Cinco de Mayo doesn't cut it.

12:13.778 --> 12:18.053
Look what happened when I
fought back, Mr. President.

12:18.088 --> 12:18.777
[bleep] you.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.221
You promised
you'd get me out of here.

12:21.256 --> 12:22.247
I miss my kids.

12:22.251 --> 12:25.051
Oh, God, I hope that was pudding.

12:25.054 --> 12:28.837
Aw, hell no. Whatever it
is, I ain't cleaning it up.

12:28.872 --> 12:31.987
You still go'' fix this titty, right?

12:31.994 --> 12:33.027
What you lookin' at, trick?

12:33.062 --> 12:35.762
I'm looking at a bunch
of haters, bitch.

12:41.704 --> 12:43.904
I'm still the president.

12:43.939 --> 12:47.169
Aye, you know that's not
pudding on your face, right?

12:47.176 --> 12:49.406
So he broke a promise
to you too, huh?

12:49.412 --> 12:51.525
Don't worry.
Tomorrow we're gonna holler

12:51.526 --> 12:54.112
at him from the grassy knoll,
if you know what I mean.

12:54.116 --> 12:57.116
Yeah, no. I... I don't
know what he means.

12:57.119 --> 12:59.649
They plannin' on Steve
Harvey Oswalding our boy.

12:59.655 --> 13:02.185
They're gonna let him
host Miss Universe

13:02.191 --> 13:03.661
and he's gonna [bleep] it up?

13:03.696 --> 13:07.224
No, fat boy.
They finsta kill him.

13:07.596 --> 13:10.296
Oh, lookie here.
It's the cast of "Scrubs."

13:10.299 --> 13:12.099
"Scrubs?"
Man, [bleep] Donald Faison.

13:12.101 --> 13:14.701
Anyway, we need
some radical negro knowledge.

13:14.703 --> 13:16.422
Let me guess,
Grover was elected president,

13:16.457 --> 13:18.105
made a bunch of promises
he couldn't keep,

13:18.140 --> 13:20.940
and now the chickens have
come home to roost, am I right?

13:20.943 --> 13:21.942
He didn't roast no chickens,

13:21.977 --> 13:24.407
but yeah, the rest
of that shit's pretty accurate.

13:24.413 --> 13:27.613
Yeah, and we don't want to see
nothing happen to our dude.

13:27.616 --> 13:28.546
Tell us what to do, Malik.

13:28.551 --> 13:30.820
You negroes and Milk
base your lives on hope,

13:30.855 --> 13:32.936
so you better start hoping
something comes along

13:32.971 --> 13:35.018
to distract the people
from the real issues,

13:35.024 --> 13:37.564
like the way everybody
was hating on Bush,

13:37.599 --> 13:40.327
then boom, 9/11.
He went from ashy to classy.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.002
Now unless your white boy
want to get this work,

13:43.037 --> 13:44.728
y'all need to kick rocks.

13:44.733 --> 13:47.366
He may be acting like a dick,
but that's our homey.

13:47.401 --> 13:49.999
We can't just stand around
and watch him get murked.

13:50.005 --> 13:52.135
Aye, Malik did give us
some good advice.

13:52.141 --> 13:52.971
What'd he say again?

13:52.975 --> 13:56.035
<i>There's nothing you can do,
but 9/11.</i>

13:56.045 --> 13:57.875
<i>Boom! Boom!</i>

13:57.880 --> 13:58.680
<i>Boom!</i>

13:58.681 --> 14:01.576
Boom, bitch. That's it.
We need a distraction.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.318
- A tu-sami would be dope.
- Stupid, we can't have no tsunami

14:04.320 --> 14:06.450
without having
a Chinese earthquake first,

14:06.455 --> 14:08.415
and that shit
would take way too long.

14:08.424 --> 14:09.524
'Tis true. 'Tis true.

14:09.525 --> 14:12.355
I got an idea, and it's got
Devry written all over it.

14:12.361 --> 14:16.167
We still owe them
for gankin' our hoes.

14:16.932 --> 14:20.465
Man, look at this dude.
This is the saddest shit I ever seen.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.198
You suck,
old bitch-ass president.

14:23.205 --> 14:24.935
Yo, how Operation Armageddon going?

14:24.940 --> 14:27.340
I told you.
It's Operation Condor.

14:27.343 --> 14:30.413
Why you always get
to name the operations, homey?

14:30.448 --> 14:33.804
- [bleep] all that. We good?
- All systems is go.

14:33.895 --> 14:37.254
In three, two, one.

14:44.426 --> 14:49.599
Mr. President, blah, blah,
blah, we're under attack.

14:57.490 --> 14:58.490
That's not gon' work.

14:58.492 --> 15:02.228
"I hereby resign from this bitch."
Perfect.

15:02.229 --> 15:04.460
- You all right, my dude?
- Yeah, we heard what happened.

15:04.464 --> 15:06.972
Not my problem now.
I just resigned.

15:07.007 --> 15:07.567
Resigned?

15:07.602 --> 15:08.897
You this close to Cindy
giving you some disaster ass

15:08.902 --> 15:12.102
and me and Jamal was gon' do
some collateral smashing too,

15:12.105 --> 15:12.895
and you want to resign?

15:12.906 --> 15:15.236
Yeah, this your time
to shine, my nig.

15:15.242 --> 15:18.823
Shine?
All I see is a bunch of shade.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.775
- Y'all don't care anyway.
- We care like a mother[bleep].

15:22.783 --> 15:26.223
I ain't steal $400 from Uncle
Joey's bitch ass for nothing.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.653
- What you talking about?
- Well, we wanted to do a tu-sami

15:28.688 --> 15:31.258
but a drone was
a whole lot economicaler.

15:31.293 --> 15:32.418
Wait a minute,
y'all was the ones

15:32.426 --> 15:34.426
who flew the drone into
Michael Clarke Duncan's mouth?

15:34.428 --> 15:38.458
I ain't no snitch, but yeah,
they was gon' murk you, homey.

15:38.465 --> 15:39.225
But we did it for you.

15:39.232 --> 15:42.302
You was finna get dealt with,
so we caused a distraction.

15:42.337 --> 15:45.103
By any means mecessary, my nig.
Ow!

15:45.138 --> 15:49.156
Man, you did all of that for me?
That's why y'all my nigs.

15:49.191 --> 15:52.235
- So what's the plan now?
- Um..

15:52.245 --> 15:54.075
Um, we didn't think
that far ahead.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.416
So you just gon' fly a drone
into a statue and not have a plan?

15:57.451 --> 15:59.651
Look, man,
we got the damn drone.

15:59.653 --> 16:01.717
- We saved your ass.
- You didn't save my ass.

16:01.721 --> 16:02.651
You created a bigger mess.

16:02.656 --> 16:05.916
You ungrateful mother[bleep].

16:09.162 --> 16:09.995
You know what?
Get out.

16:10.030 --> 16:12.460
The president needs a moment
to himself.

16:12.466 --> 16:14.266
Dis nigga.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.097
Damn, I'm a failure.

16:16.102 --> 16:17.701
<i>You not a failure, boss.</i>

16:17.736 --> 16:19.301
Michael Clarke Duncan?

16:19.306 --> 16:20.066
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

16:20.073 --> 16:21.813
<i>I usually help white people
with they problems.</i>

16:21.848 --> 16:22.968
<i>They don't think about me
no more,</i>

16:22.976 --> 16:25.206
<i>so I'm here to help you,
little chocolate boy.</i>

16:25.212 --> 16:28.013
<i>All's I needs you to do
is believes in yourself.</i>

16:28.048 --> 16:30.648
<i>I's never actually said that
to a black person before.</i>

16:30.650 --> 16:33.920
Michael Clarke Duncan,
why you talking like a slave?

16:33.955 --> 16:34.720
<i>'Cause I is.</i>

16:34.721 --> 16:37.691
<i>In heaven, I keeps the clouds
nice and soft.</i>

16:37.726 --> 16:40.261
<i>Not as many white people
up here as I thought, through.</i>

16:40.296 --> 16:42.560
So all I got to do
is believe in myself?

16:42.562 --> 16:44.402
<i>That's hows it works in the movies.</i>

16:44.437 --> 16:45.997
<i>A black man says something wise,</i>

16:45.999 --> 16:47.883
<i>and then a white writer
gets the statue.</i>

16:47.918 --> 16:49.767
<i>Almost happened in
"Straight Outta Compton."</i>

16:49.769 --> 16:52.469
<i>Now go out there and tells them
the truth.</i>

16:52.472 --> 16:53.572
I'll do it.

16:53.573 --> 16:54.206
<i>Good job, son.</i>

16:54.241 --> 16:56.575
<i>And just remember,
Omarosa killed me.</i>

16:56.610 --> 16:59.710
<i>She stabbed me in my
pancreas with an icicles.</i>

16:59.713 --> 17:01.513
<i>An icicles.</i>

17:03.517 --> 17:05.517
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:05.519 --> 17:06.378
You don't understand.

17:06.386 --> 17:08.445
I can't let
Michael Clarke Duncan down.

17:08.454 --> 17:12.214
My fellow students, today
is a sad day at Duncan High.

17:12.224 --> 17:14.025
Lovers of hate attacked our school.

17:14.027 --> 17:16.057
<i>Oh, to hell with that speech,
mother[bleep].</i>

17:16.061 --> 17:18.962
What is you gon' do about Devry?

17:21.034 --> 17:22.534
<i>Sells it, Grover.</i>

17:22.569 --> 17:25.069
This is a day
when we as Duncan High

17:25.070 --> 17:27.540
will unite in the name of freedom.

17:27.576 --> 17:31.781
We was attacked because
of our spirit and our swag.

17:33.847 --> 17:35.477
They mad 'cause we be stuntin',

17:35.482 --> 17:38.881
and our females is bangable.

17:38.885 --> 17:42.285
If Devry High thinks that
they can get away with this,

17:42.289 --> 17:43.789
they haven't seen shit yet.

17:43.790 --> 17:45.520
This is
Michael Clarke Duncan High!

17:45.525 --> 17:47.927
The same Michael Clarke
Duncan who could cry on command

17:47.928 --> 17:50.088
and help Bruce Willis
destroy an asteroid.

17:50.096 --> 17:53.026
Who kept the grill going
during Roscoe's family reunion

17:53.033 --> 17:55.487
and went toe-to-toe
with Ben Affleck in "Daredevil."

17:55.522 --> 17:57.941
He went from being a part
of Uncle Luke's entourage

17:57.976 --> 17:59.568
to fixing Tom Hanks's dick.

17:59.573 --> 18:02.273
If folks wanna pop off,
then let's pop off.

18:02.275 --> 18:05.005
Devry ain't got no love
for Michael Clarke Duncan?

18:05.011 --> 18:06.881
Well, let it be known then!

18:08.815 --> 18:13.245
♪ Amazing grace ♪

18:13.253 --> 18:15.387
<i>♪ How sweet ♪</i>

18:15.422 --> 18:18.133
I think the party's back on.

18:19.027 --> 18:19.624
What the [bleep]!

18:19.659 --> 18:20.859
There's something fishy,
Mumblemouth.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.730
It's probably Cindy.
Randy know what she need to do.

18:22.765 --> 18:25.180
<i>She could use
some Summer's Eve.</i>

18:25.265 --> 18:26.965
- No.
- Come on, Ms. Noble.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.900
All we need is a few gats

18:27.901 --> 18:30.341
and we can go to war
on these fools.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.904
- No.
- We can't go out like no punk bitches.

18:32.906 --> 18:35.907
Today, it was our statue.
What will it be tomorrow?

18:35.909 --> 18:37.776
Our school buses?
Our cheerleaders?

18:37.811 --> 18:40.511
A cyber attack to take
away the teachers' pensions?

18:41.147 --> 18:45.717
You can take my pension
from my cold, dead fingers!

18:45.719 --> 18:49.619
I don't care
how many of you have to die!

18:49.623 --> 18:51.092
We're going to war!

18:51.127 --> 18:53.559
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Stop the presses!

18:53.560 --> 18:55.694
Stop the presses!
It was all fake.

18:55.695 --> 18:58.355
Devry High School
did not try to attack us.

18:58.365 --> 19:01.825
Grover here is trying
to pull a Donald Rumsfeld!

19:01.835 --> 19:03.635
Lies! They all lies!

19:03.637 --> 19:04.597
Yo, who's Donald Rumsfeld?

19:04.604 --> 19:07.144
I think that's the dude
that used to own the Clippers.

19:07.179 --> 19:11.110
I got the black box
from the drone.

19:11.111 --> 19:12.511
Check it out.

19:12.879 --> 19:15.649
<i> You think this'll [bleep] up
that statue?</i>

19:15.684 --> 19:18.116
<i>Hell yeah.
And won't nobody know we did it.</i>

19:18.151 --> 19:19.951
<i> Aye, how you spell Devry?</i>

19:19.953 --> 19:21.723
Yo, they got us, Grove.

19:21.758 --> 19:23.286
- Us?
- Grover!

19:23.289 --> 19:26.689
You were about to send us
to war under false pretenses?

19:26.693 --> 19:30.471
What do you have
to say for yourself?

19:30.639 --> 19:35.582
♪ Amazing grace ♪

19:40.041 --> 19:42.611
Good lookin' out on the
presidential pardon, Grover.

19:42.646 --> 19:44.999
- You got it, my dude.
- Yeah, detention was tryin'

19:45.000 --> 19:47.213
to incarcerate my black ass
for two weeks.

19:47.248 --> 19:49.948
I'm just glad this whole
president thing is over.

19:49.951 --> 19:50.783
Aww, yeah.

19:50.818 --> 19:54.918
Operation Bust a Nut
is back in effect.

19:54.922 --> 19:56.821
Where do you think y'all goin'?

19:56.856 --> 20:00.656
- We goin' to the inaugural ball.
- After that shit y'all did?

20:00.661 --> 20:03.601
You're on
the "no longer fly" list.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.998
Hold up!
This is our party.

20:04.999 --> 20:08.501
Yeah, and you did a good job.
It's turned up in there.

20:08.503 --> 20:11.203
Greatest party I've ever seen.

20:11.205 --> 20:13.335
Man, Craigery gonna be a legend.

20:13.341 --> 20:17.641
If y'all hurry home,
maybe someone's Periscoping.

20:24.051 --> 20:25.685
Damn, even the drone's smashing.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.320
You know what, it doesn't matter.

20:27.321 --> 20:28.951
When I needed you guys,
you had my back.

20:28.956 --> 20:31.786
The school, local law
enforcement, and the FBI

20:31.792 --> 20:34.464
may see you as terrorists,
but you're more than that to me.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.492
You're care-orists.

20:35.496 --> 20:38.726
Well, before we start
sucking each other's dicks,

20:38.733 --> 20:41.001
y'all wanna know a secret?

20:41.036 --> 20:43.169
I'm the phantom shitter.

20:43.271 --> 20:45.765
Aw, hell no!
Not the trophy!
