00:47.247 --> 00:48.305
Hello?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.440
Beth, hey.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.745
Can you let me up?

00:51.818 --> 00:52.842
I, uh...

00:52.919 --> 00:54.887
I'm locked out of my apartment

00:54.954 --> 00:58.549
and I lost my wallet and my keys.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.922
No. You can't come up right now.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.257
Is someone up there with you?

01:07.901 --> 01:08.890
No.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.334
Is it him?

01:16.176 --> 01:19.304
Look, Beth, I...

01:19.379 --> 01:21.244
I'm locked out.

01:21.314 --> 01:24.044
And I have had the worst night
of my life and I...

01:26.252 --> 01:28.447
Look, if you help me,
I'll leave you alone.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.489
Okay? Both of you.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.502
I feel sorry for you, Tommy.

01:46.573 --> 01:47.801
I do.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.830
Have you ever been lied to

02:47.901 --> 02:50.631
by someone you trusted completely?

02:50.703 --> 02:53.604
Just had your little heart torn out

02:53.673 --> 02:56.699
and shoved down your throat?

02:56.776 --> 03:00.212
Trust me, it's not nearly
as fun as it sounds.

03:08.755 --> 03:09.949
I hate to admit it,

03:10.023 --> 03:13.618
but I was totally blindsided
by the whole thing.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.526
And I deal with the best liars
in the world every day.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.030
I'm shorted another hundred thousand.

03:19.098 --> 03:20.190
That's right, every sale's a good one.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.790
Take that spin off the fucking tape

03:21.868 --> 03:24.359
or I'm going to come through this phone
and bite your fucking eyes out.

03:24.437 --> 03:25.597
Okay, talk to you later.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.833
...is up 30 percent,
top line is flat.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.602
It's not my fault you own this dodgy stock.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.541
Don't worry, don't worry,
you're in good hands.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.273
Half a million Johnny-John
to travel, who's in?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.542
This girl is a-fucking-amazing.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.777
Is anybody going to get me fucking done
on the Cisco, please?

03:38.851 --> 03:39.977
Make some calls, people, please.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.987
Yeah, just hold for me.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.250
How, you're done at 50 thou on the figure,
Jen'll call you with the report.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.882
- All right? Did you get that 50,000?
- Calling him now.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.824
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.192
My whole system just crashed again.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.457
Where is Iceman?

03:51.531 --> 03:52.964
You sent him out for coffee.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.556
Hey, Shakes,
am I filling that Microsoft yet, or...

03:54.634 --> 03:55.896
I'm working it, man.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.199
- Where the fuck is my latte?
- Probably still with Iceman.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.169
Shakespeare, it's fucking Microsoft.
Just put it up.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.174
- Okay.
- Bobby, stay with me, all right?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.039
- He's working it. I'll have it done soon.
- What is the point

04:04.110 --> 04:07.204
of having an Army geek computer nerd

04:07.280 --> 04:10.113
if he is never fucking here?

04:10.183 --> 04:13.448
A Princeton diploma and three years
in the Air Force put to good use.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.450
Thank you, Daniel.

04:16.522 --> 04:18.285
And 63 cents change.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.828
Listen, Daniel, my computer
has crashed again.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.925
Would you mind taking a look
when you get the chance?

04:30.003 --> 04:34.133
Well, did you check and see if you just
kicked out the plug again?

04:39.312 --> 04:42.440
It was kind of acting up
before that, though.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.847
Thanks, soldier.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.364
You know, when I first started,

05:03.436 --> 05:05.267
he used to send me
to McDonald's every day.

05:05.338 --> 05:08.705
Double quarter pounder with cheese,
hold the pickles.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.539
Doesn't really bother me that much.

05:11.611 --> 05:12.942
You won't be here in a year

05:13.012 --> 05:15.344
if you keep on serving coffee to that prick.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.716
Well, I like working with computers,

05:18.785 --> 05:22.516
but to be honest,
the stuff that I'm doing here...

05:22.588 --> 05:25.182
I'd rather do what you do at some point.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.759
"This is the saddest
story I have ever heard."

05:30.830 --> 05:33.856
<i>Thus begins the classic novel
The Good Soldier,</i>

05:33.933 --> 05:39.803
in one of the most memorable
first lines in modern fiction.

05:39.872 --> 05:43.069
Well, that sounds
about as fun as date rape.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.905
<i>No kidding, I vote for Lolita.</i>

05:44.977 --> 05:47.172
Then it's sex with minors by a landslide.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.305
<i>Can we read
The Good Soldier next, though?</i>

05:49.382 --> 05:50.940
Can't we ever read something
with a happy ending?

05:51.017 --> 05:53.383
This is New York City.
The only happy endings are in Chinatown.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.013
- No offense.
- None taken. I'm Korean.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.215
Are you really?

05:57.290 --> 06:00.623
No. What's wrong with you people?

06:04.097 --> 06:05.587
Have a good night, Tommy.

06:05.665 --> 06:06.757
You too, Irv.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.892
- Taxi?
- Donny. Yes, please.

06:08.968 --> 06:10.458
For all the excitement and glamour,

06:10.536 --> 06:14.438
life in the big city
does have its downside.

06:14.507 --> 06:18.568
I mean, if you thought
Wall Street was full of bullshitters,

06:18.644 --> 06:22.205
you should try having
a relationship here.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.409
And maybe it's like this
everywhere nowadays,

06:25.485 --> 06:28.852
but it just feels like
a war zone here sometimes.

06:30.656 --> 06:33.489
I know everyone has
some kind of a history.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.393
It's not like I've always been a saint.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.626
You know, I guess I just hoped things
would be different with Beth.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.930
You've been dating for two months
and you still haven't had sex?

06:43.002 --> 06:44.629
You made Rich wait about two hours.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.899
Maybe your first time
with him could be in Italy.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.804
- You never know.
- Aw.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.433
- That would be lovely.
- Cheesy.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.569
What would you do if Rich left his wife?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.273
Where did that come from?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.646
Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.047
Oh, hey.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.815
No, we were just
talking about shopping.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.981
- Oh, I'm sure you were.
- Yeah.

07:04.056 --> 07:05.045
You know Jordan.

07:05.124 --> 07:07.149
This is Lisa, Susan, and Jill.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.488
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.994
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.723
Would you guys like
to go grab a drink with us?

07:11.798 --> 07:13.629
- My treat?
- Oh, thanks, but we're

07:13.699 --> 07:15.257
meeting my boyfriend Bill
and some of his friends.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.733
From Face book.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.293
- Bye.
- He's adorable.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.895
- Oh.
- He's hot. If you don't do him, I will.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.270
- Okay.
- Bye, Tommy. Nice to meet you.

07:22.341 --> 07:25.071
- Have fun.
- What was she whispering to you?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.135
Maybe I'll tell you in Italy.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.850
Do you think it means something
that we're both left-handed?

07:33.920 --> 07:38.323
We'd only need one pair of scissors
if we moved in together.

07:38.391 --> 07:43.488
Isn't it a little early to be talking
about sharing scissors?

07:49.268 --> 07:55.036
Does it bother you that
I'm not doing anything...

07:55.107 --> 07:57.905
amazing with my life?

07:58.010 --> 07:59.739
There's plenty of time for that.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.714
Yeah. I don't want to end up
like my boss Cash, you know?

08:02.782 --> 08:06.582
Like, almost 50,
nothing to show for it but a bad marriage

08:06.652 --> 08:09.883
and an awesome set of golf clubs.

08:09.956 --> 08:14.757
Yeah. My boss is 42 and she's never
been married or anything.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.193
I don't think she's ever even been in love.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.159
Have you?

08:24.103 --> 08:25.536
I thought so.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.541
But I think that when somebody turns out
to be completely different

08:29.609 --> 08:32.236
than what you thought,
it doesn't really count.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.378
What happened with
your last girlfriend?

08:38.451 --> 08:39.611
Christie.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.019
It just wasn't right.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.623
You want to get that?

09:01.774 --> 09:04.607
Yeah, no.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.804
Thought he stopped calling.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.280
He did. He started again.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.409
We all have a past, Beth.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.285
It's... It's how you deal with it.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.464
I just got off the phone with the people
on the Battery Park dig.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.090
They uncovered an old wall

09:28.167 --> 09:30.795
that I think could be from
the original Dutch settlement here.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.428
Oh, my God.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.598
- That's amazing.
- Well, they're not going to see it that way

09:34.674 --> 09:37.040
once they realize it's going to set
their construction back a few months

09:37.109 --> 09:38.371
while we excavate.

09:38.444 --> 09:39.741
Oh, and Beth?

09:39.812 --> 09:44.306
This could be something
worth presenting in Florence.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.283
What the fuck
do you want me to do, Robert?

09:46.352 --> 09:48.877
- I am here...
- I got to hop, this guy's killing me.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.217
God, I love the mute button.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.814
There are five other calls
I can make here, Tommy.

09:52.892 --> 09:53.950
You got to release me.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.220
I understand that, Bobby.

09:55.294 --> 09:56.556
Just give me one second, okay?

09:56.629 --> 09:59.120
Hey, Shakes, this guy's
a really good client.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.495
You can't just put this up for me?

10:00.566 --> 10:02.056
I don't care if he's the fucking Pope.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.965
How do I know he's
not going to fuck me over?

10:04.036 --> 10:06.061
I'm hanging up, Tommy.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.400
Okay, one call.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.270
Then you can go and let
every other loser on Wall Street

10:09.342 --> 10:10.707
fuck this up for you, okay?

10:10.776 --> 10:13.973
Fine. But keep me on the wire
and don't fucking mute me.

10:14.046 --> 10:17.106
Okay. Baker, didn't you say you had
a big seller the other day?

10:17.183 --> 10:19.674
Yeah, Pacific. We're still
in the penalty box with him.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.721
Okay, you know what?
Give him to me.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.813
Page five.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.022
You know you guys
are still cut off, right?

10:29.095 --> 10:30.653
Hey. This is actually Tom Fielding.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.061
I run the sales desk over here.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.962
How you doing, Tom?
John Caldwell.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.297
I was calling to ask
a yes or no question, all right?

10:36.369 --> 10:37.358
Fine.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.063
Are you potentially interested

10:39.138 --> 10:41.504
in trading Microsoft today, yes or no?

10:43.142 --> 10:45.770
Potentially.
But not with you guys.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.335
Bobby, this is going to happen.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.971
Now, just FYI,

10:49.048 --> 10:50.913
I have a guy looking
for a pretty big chunk.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.211
Maybe half a mile.

10:52.284 --> 10:56.050
- Does that interest you?
- Potentially. Sure.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.353
Unfortunately, John, I don't have
the luxury of a lot of time here.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.892
My guy's real.
He's on the phone for one call.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.519
And that's you. Half a mile?

11:03.596 --> 11:07.555
On the wire, last print, in or out?

11:08.934 --> 11:09.958
Put it up.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.197
Great. Now, this is just me asking.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.499
Would you be able to go larger?

11:13.572 --> 11:14.869
Hey, half a mile,
trying to go bigger.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.841
- Are you trying to front run me?
- No.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.003
You just got to trust me,
just a little bit, okay, John?

11:22.748 --> 11:23.715
Two million.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.717
Could go to two million here.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.218
No, it's not Bill Gates on the line.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.220
He's a mutual fund guy,
just like you.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.153
Well, he's got a lot more hair
and he's a little better looking.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.713
Fine. Make it read two.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.384
Okay. Is two million your total picture?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.690
Why? Is he trying to move more?

11:38.264 --> 11:40.061
What's he saying.
Are we done here? Let's go!

11:40.132 --> 11:42.259
Is he trying to move more?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.563
All right, gentlemen,
I'm on the phone with both you right now.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.836
I think this ticket reads five million
and we all walk away.

11:50.910 --> 11:51.877
That be on a cleanup?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.138
I knew he had more behind that.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.304
You're a genius.
Seriously, Bobby,

11:54.380 --> 11:55.972
is this a cleanup for you?
No bullshit.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.449
Five million, I go home and fuck
my Polish housekeeper twice.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.076
It's a cleanup, John.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.417
Okay, fine.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.080
Put it up.
But, oh, Tom?

12:04.156 --> 12:06.181
You'll still be in the box
for a week, though.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.451
Cross at five million, clean.

12:09.528 --> 12:11.519
See how far a little trust can get you?

12:13.866 --> 12:15.834
Another record down today
on Wall Street today

12:15.901 --> 12:17.300
with all major indexes...

12:19.538 --> 12:22.632
The Bargello and Academia
are great, but skip the Uffizi.

12:22.708 --> 12:23.970
What about those Botticelli’s?

12:24.043 --> 12:26.307
And Michelangelo's only oil painting?

12:26.378 --> 12:28.437
There's a reason he stopped after one.
It's just for tourists.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.778
I am a tourist.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.442
Hi.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.349
Is everything okay?

12:36.021 --> 12:37.352
Why?

12:37.423 --> 12:38.788
What happened?

12:38.858 --> 12:42.658
Funding constraints.
The agency cut all international travel.

12:44.997 --> 12:48.364
So, what's the good news?

12:50.269 --> 12:53.636
How would you like to be
head of urban conservation?

12:53.706 --> 12:56.266
- You're quitting?
- Not here.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.105
In San Francisco.

13:10.089 --> 13:11.784
Hey. Where were you?

13:11.857 --> 13:14.621
I'm sorry. I just changed now
and I'm on the way.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.320
- Are you still up?
- It's 10:00.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.590
- What happened?
- If I have to listen

13:18.664 --> 13:19.961
to one more hedge fund douche bag

13:20.032 --> 13:21.727
talk to me about private jet timeshares,

13:21.801 --> 13:23.894
I swear to God I'm going to
shoot myself in the face.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.494
Yeah, well, my trip
got cancelled today.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.665
Grab your stuff
and meet me downstairs.

13:29.742 --> 13:30.674
Huh?

13:30.743 --> 13:33.234
- Grab your stuff.
- Where are we going?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.213
Don't worry about it.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.142
All right. Step out.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.811
Okay.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.617
And one big step up.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.749
Right there.
I'm going to take this off you.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.157
You got to keep
your eyes closed, okay?

13:48.227 --> 13:49.626
Are you sure we're still in the city?

13:49.695 --> 13:52.061
Yeah, just... just...

13:52.131 --> 13:53.894
- Here.
- Here we go.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.025
- Great.
- Eyes closed.

13:56.101 --> 14:00.834
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.133
No peeking.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.144
I'm not.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.044
- I saw that.
- What?

14:09.114 --> 14:10.979
You peek again,
I'm going to take you home.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.080
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.625
Almost there.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.661
All right, turn this way.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.891
Now, open your eyes.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.798
Oh, my God.
Where are we?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.234
It's as close to Tuscany
as I could get in Manhattan.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.972
Come on.
Come on, this way.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.837
It gets better.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.537
- Come on.
- This is so beautiful.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.279
How did you find this place?

14:49.355 --> 14:52.381
You know.
I got to keep some surprises.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.258
I'm sorry your trip got cancelled.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.164
Thank you.

15:05.271 --> 15:06.898
One more surprise.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.381
May I have this dance?

15:17.449 --> 15:19.883
Yes.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.500
Wait.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.703
I think I have something.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.517
I just didn't want to be one of those girls

15:56.588 --> 15:58.021
who sleeps with a lot of guys.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.188
I don't want you to sleep
with a lot of guys.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.260
Right.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.322
I'll do it.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.097
- Other way.
- Oh, sorry.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.376
Okay.

16:31.290 --> 16:35.283
Yeah, Frank,
you are all done for the day.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.329
No, thank you.

16:37.396 --> 16:40.854
That is 100,000 CRM
to Williams for the day.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.400
And Shakespeare,

16:42.468 --> 16:45.232
have I ever told you
how handsome you are?

16:45.304 --> 16:46.532
Somebody's in a good mood today.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.004
- Tom.
- Yep?

16:48.073 --> 16:49.836
Got a second?

17:07.659 --> 17:08.853
So, what's up?

17:11.262 --> 17:13.060
I got an offer from another firm.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.660
About twice what I'm making here.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.906
I don't know what to say.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.636
I mean, I'd hate to lose you,
but if I go to Cash with this,

17:24.710 --> 17:26.769
especially right now,
the way things are,

17:26.845 --> 17:29.507
he might agree to a little kiss,
but a double?

17:29.581 --> 17:31.344
No way.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.783
I know, I figured.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.480
All right, look.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.819
You got to do what's right for you.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.290
Are you thinking about taking it?

17:43.195 --> 17:44.958
You already did.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.697
Well, man, what can I say?
It's been a great run.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.293
It's going to be tough to replace you.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.951
I like that a lot.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.458
Listen, I got to go, okay?

18:14.526 --> 18:16.517
No, you hang up first.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.893
No, you hang up.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.933
Twenty-one-year-old physical therapist.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.332
Thousand bucks a month
for a studio on the Upper East Side.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.701
- A home run.
- Sounds like it.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.297
You got to see her.
She's so fucking hot.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.968
You should invite her to your place
for the mid-year dinner.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.012
Yeah. She can sit
right next to my wife.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.104
Can you imagine?

18:36.181 --> 18:37.739
Who you bringing, hotshot?

18:37.816 --> 18:39.477
That Christie girl still in the picture?

18:39.551 --> 18:41.519
No. Beth. You met her at the golf event.

18:41.587 --> 18:42.918
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:42.988 --> 18:44.649
That brunette who wouldn't fuck you.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.185
Listen, can I just talk to you off the desk,
just for a second?

18:50.395 --> 18:52.955
So, she did fuck you.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.693
How long was that woman,
like, two months or something?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.598
Jesus, that girl was your sexual Vietnam.

18:57.703 --> 18:58.863
Not saying a word.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.967
And so you just let him walk out.

19:04.042 --> 19:07.239
He's your top guy for two years.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.405
He already took the job.
He didn't want to make a scene.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.244
Well, there's going to be
a big fucking scene tomorrow,

19:11.316 --> 19:13.807
when 20 of our biggest accounts call
and no one's answering the fucking phone.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.046
We'll hire someone else.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.884
That will take weeks.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.454
Why the fuck didn't you let me talk to him?

19:21.527 --> 19:23.461
I could convince that fucking
cocksucker to stay.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.156
They guaranteed him two million a year
for two years,

19:25.230 --> 19:27.357
- plus upside.
- How much are we paying him?

19:27.432 --> 19:30.367
Seven fifty this year...
a buck, tops.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.904
Yeah, okay, we were too low.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.305
All right, mister head of sales,
what's your contingency plan?

19:37.376 --> 19:40.777
I'm sure you have one.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.370
I think Daniel can step up.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.182
Are you out of your fucking mind?

19:48.253 --> 19:50.153
That guy couldn't sell vagina
on a pirate ship.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.986
- He's smart, he's honest.
- He's too fucking honest.

19:53.058 --> 19:54.582
He's a fucking retarded Boy Scout.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.787
That is exactly what
you said about Shakespeare.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.489
- Tommy. - It's exactly what
you said about Chris Baker.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.226
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.200
Why are guys like us good at our job?

20:08.273 --> 20:10.241
Because people like us.
We take them out, they have a good time.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.571
They might even meet a real, live girl.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.338
Daniel is a lovely fellow.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.209
He's as much fun as Chlamydia.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.407
I'm telling you this will work.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.211
Let me remind you the value we place
on human capital here at Morgan Brothers.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.777
- Your future...
- I understand.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.689
Your future depends
on the depth and the quality

20:27.759 --> 20:30.956
of the team that you build.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.327
Now, in light of that,

20:33.398 --> 20:35.423
I'll ask you once.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.369
Is Daniel your guy?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.600
Yes.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.504
Great.

20:51.683 --> 20:53.446
I'm telling you, this
chick I'm banging in HR

20:53.518 --> 20:55.816
said that he was discharged
early from the Air Force.

20:55.887 --> 20:58.253
- And they sealed his file. Yes.
- Hey, hey.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.621
- Ha-ha!
- Look, all I'm saying is

21:00.659 --> 21:03.059
we need someone to fill
Baker's spot immediately.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.120
And if we let Cash pick one of his guys,

21:06.198 --> 21:08.257
we're all going to be watching our asses.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.563
I'm just not buying
this nice guy act, all right?

21:10.636 --> 21:13.901
Nobody joins the military,
much less Wall Street,

21:13.972 --> 21:16.463
without having, you know,
some kind of a dark side.

21:16.541 --> 21:19.135
You're right, Wall Street is no place
for an ambitious white male.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.179
Of questionable integrity.

21:21.246 --> 21:22.804
Well, I think it's going to be great.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.781
Yeah, of course you do, Stephens.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.148
Finally, someone on the desk
that gets less ass than you.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.584
All right, that settles it.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.713
I'm leaving my wife of ten years

21:30.789 --> 21:33.257
and I'm moving in on Steve-O's couch.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.259
- Who said you could have my couch?
- Did you say ten years?

21:35.327 --> 21:37.352
You get married when you were, like, 24?

21:37.429 --> 21:39.761
Yeah, I met here when I was 22.
I got married at 24.

21:39.831 --> 21:42.959
- Christ on a bun.
- You know, it's just different.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.832
- I'm sure I'll be there soon enough.
- Yeah.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.268
Sorry I'm late.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.034
- Hey.
- We're doing this whole system upgrade.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.302
And we can only reset the servers
after you guys leave.

21:51.376 --> 21:55.107
Plus the new software rollout
is taking forever.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.547
Right. Daniel, you know Chris Baker's
no longer with the firm, right?

21:58.650 --> 22:01.551
Yeah, I heard.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.044
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.818
We've been talking.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.587
And we thought that...

22:08.660 --> 22:10.321
you'd be the right guy
to step into his spot.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.794
Starting immediately.

22:11.863 --> 22:14.297
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.362
- He's got a lot of big accounts, though.
- Don't worry.

22:17.436 --> 22:18.733
We'll split them up.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.897
This is a bit of a
sink-or-swim business, mate.

22:20.972 --> 22:22.633
Opportunities like this,
they don't come knocking often.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.505
Yeah.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.544
Look, I mean, we'll all
be there to help you out

22:26.611 --> 22:27.839
till you get your legs under you.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.540
You're going to be
an old pro in no time.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.013
- All right.
- We got you.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.141
Thanks, Tommy.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.479
I'm not going to let you guys down.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.452
Good. Sorry, guys, couldn't resist.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.519
Here. Don't worry about it, drink it.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.081
No, no, I fucking hate tequila, Tommy.

22:41.159 --> 22:43.320
- This is the good stuff.
- Hey, do you have any lime?

22:43.395 --> 22:44.885
Doesn't even taste like tequila.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.191
Jeez. Here's to Daniel.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.322
- All right.
- Welcome on board.

22:50.502 --> 22:52.527
That fucking tastes like tequila.

22:52.604 --> 22:53.593
Tastes like honey.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.970
I'm just saying that if I were black,

22:56.041 --> 22:57.508
I'd just want to be called black.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.702
You know?
It just sounds so cool.

22:59.745 --> 23:00.939
Why would you say that?

23:01.012 --> 23:02.707
African-American just sounds
awkward and lame.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.305
- Why would you say that?
- It's okay.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.783
I'm allowed to speculate
about how I might feel.

23:06.852 --> 23:07.978
I'm also ethnic.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.511
I mean, do you really prefer
to be called African-American?

23:11.590 --> 23:13.990
You mean despite the fact
that I'm neither of those?

23:14.059 --> 23:15.287
- Right.
- Okay.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.989
Okay, so in England,
what do they call a black...

23:19.064 --> 23:20.793
Englishman.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.663
Who are you bringing
to Cash's mid-year dinner?

23:22.734 --> 23:25.066
- Who am I bringing?
- Yeah.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.764
I didn't know
I was supposed to bring a date.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.533
I didn't even know
I was supposed to go.

23:28.607 --> 23:31.337
Okay. Saturday. Homework.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.106
Tomorrow. You guys with me.
I got to go.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.704
Hey. Dust someone off.
It doesn't have to be anything special.

23:36.782 --> 23:39.273
- Ladies. Any chance, ladies?
- So, where are we going to go now?

23:39.351 --> 23:41.512
Any, any chance whatsoever?

23:41.586 --> 23:44.111
I don't know, okay?
But it's Tuesday.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.554
- I can't stay out past 3.
- We have got to go.

23:45.624 --> 23:48.593
84th and 5th, please.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.394
Hey. How's it going with the new guy?

23:54.466 --> 23:55.398
He's fine.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.458
Just he's one of those lost souls

23:57.569 --> 23:59.537
that kind of dropped
off the grid for a little bit

23:59.571 --> 24:01.300
to find himself.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.204
I'm not so sure it worked.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.708
Why do you want to hire him, then?

24:04.776 --> 24:05.936
No, I mean, he's smart.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.672
And he's a fucking computer genius.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.180
I mean, maybe all those stupid
Army training commercials were true.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.011
Hey, so, you coming over?

24:12.083 --> 24:13.311
I wish I could. I just...

24:13.385 --> 24:17.754
I got to get up early tomorrow
to cover for Chris Baker.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.383
I'll call you tomorrow,
though, I promise. Okay?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.290
- Okay.
- Good night.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.706
Would you please
stop checking on me?

24:45.784 --> 24:47.342
Have you even talked
to anybody yet?

24:47.419 --> 24:48.943
I feel like a total perv.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.750
The last girl I talked to was
in the prenatal care section.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.519
Hey. Bookstore was your idea.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.458
I know. It's just...

24:56.528 --> 24:57.756
not everyone is good at this stuff.

24:58.864 --> 25:02.027
All right, Daniel.
You are a great guy.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.226
Okay?

25:03.301 --> 25:07.635
Any woman in this city
would be lucky to talk to a guy like you.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.503
Oh, my God.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.508
You should see this girl
who just got in the line.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.508
There you go.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.807
- Now go talk to her.
- I can't.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.678
- What do I say? I don't know.
- It'll come to you.

25:17.749 --> 25:20.843
Just move before someone else
gets in line in front of you.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.154
Sorry.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.430
Where in Italy are you going?

25:38.637 --> 25:41.936
Oh. I'm not.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.339
I'm just returning this.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.938
That's too bad.
It's amazing there.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.779
Yeah. My trip there just got cancelled,

25:52.851 --> 25:57.754
so that's not really what
I need to hear, but yeah.

25:59.524 --> 26:02.652
Did I say amazing?
I meant awful.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.092
Full of Italians.

26:04.162 --> 26:07.529
Does that help at all?

26:07.599 --> 26:09.396
Not really.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.492
Well, you know what,
you should keep it

26:11.570 --> 26:14.130
and put it in a place
where you'll see it all the time,

26:14.205 --> 26:17.299
and that way you'll always be reminded

26:17.375 --> 26:19.275
about how much you want to go.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.448
That might be the worst idea
I've ever heard.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.610
Yeah, but you know
you'd end up going.

26:27.686 --> 26:28.983
I mean, you know
what they say.

26:29.054 --> 26:33.252
If you forget your dreams,
it's like they never existed.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.793
Who says that?

26:38.229 --> 26:41.130
Nobody. I just made that up.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.666
But it's true.

26:44.202 --> 26:45.669
Next.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.762
Oh.

26:47.839 --> 26:51.969
You go ahead. I think
I might keep it, actually.

26:52.043 --> 26:54.102
Thanks.

26:54.179 --> 26:57.046
Next in line, please.

27:01.319 --> 27:04.311
Sir, can I help you?

27:04.389 --> 27:06.653
Oh, I need a book.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.255
So, question is

27:14.332 --> 27:16.926
which one of the three women
did he hire?

27:17.002 --> 27:18.970
The one who redecorated the office.

27:19.037 --> 27:21.733
- Wrong.
- The one who doubled their sales.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.774
Nope. Daniel?

27:23.842 --> 27:25.707
Then the one who loves children.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.335
No.

27:27.412 --> 27:30.438
The one with the biggest tits.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.686
That must be how Larry got the job.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.551
One look at these man-boobs
and I was in, huh?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.155
Hey, Daniel, you got any jokes?

27:44.229 --> 27:45.457
Yeah, let's hear from the new guy.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.998
Oh, I can never remember any jokes.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.466
Oh, come on.
You got to know at least one.

27:50.535 --> 27:51.661
Yeah, come on, Daniel.

27:51.736 --> 27:55.365
Well, I guess I can think of one.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.965
But it's so stupid.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.907
Come on, go ahead, tell it.

28:04.315 --> 28:06.112
Okay.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.487
What do you call
a fish with two knees?

28:09.554 --> 28:11.215
I don't know. What?

28:11.289 --> 28:13.416
A two-knee fish.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.989
Like tuna, but...

28:19.064 --> 28:21.726
You have to think about it.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.233
That's a... That's a classic.

28:25.303 --> 28:27.737
- That's actually pretty good.
- That one, yeah.

28:27.806 --> 28:30.639
- Where are we going tonight?
- Should we just hit the usual petting zoo?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.506
No. No strip clubs tonight.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.101
Let's meet some civilians.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.942
Yeah. Hey, hey, Daniel?

28:36.014 --> 28:37.538
You know any girls
who'll meet us out?

28:37.615 --> 28:39.742
Yeah, who you got on speed dial?

28:39.818 --> 28:42.446
I don't know a lot of women
I can just call up like that.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.715
Well, okay.
Where's the hot spot?

28:44.789 --> 28:45.949
You know, Wednesday nights.

28:47.192 --> 28:49.558
Wednesday?

28:49.627 --> 28:51.857
I don't really go out much on Wednesdays.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.421
Anymore.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.730
Anymore. This guy... Animal.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.413
- Nut?
- I'm okay.

29:14.486 --> 29:15.680
Thank you.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.224
Pick up the phone, say hello.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.988
Go ahead, pick it up.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.499
There's no one there.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.660
Humour me.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.734
- Hello?
- Good.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.640
Hang it up and do it again.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.176
- Hello.
- Very nice.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.445
Pretty easy, huh?
Really fucking easy.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.043
But I don't pay my salesmen
millions of dollars

29:49.120 --> 29:50.644
to answer the phone.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.316
I pay them to make it ring.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.258
Billy Simmons called today.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.797
He doesn't want Daniel to cover them.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.799
Any idea why?

30:02.867 --> 30:04.198
They're very different people.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.830
You are on...
Sit the fuck down.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.435
You are only going
to bat for that guy

30:11.509 --> 30:14.740
because you know
that you will own him.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.772
You can fool everybody else, Tom,
but you can't fool me.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.750
He's the type of guy
I want on my team.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.287
- He's honest, loyal...
- Like Chris Baker?

30:24.956 --> 30:27.584
Make no mistake,
Daniel will throw you under a fucking bus

30:27.659 --> 30:29.320
the first day he gets a chance.

30:29.394 --> 30:31.328
This is not sleep away camp, Tommy.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.695
Your job is to make me rich. Period.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.200
Now, however you're going to get
that guy a fucking personality,

30:37.268 --> 30:39.463
<i>you better do it fast,
or I'm going to fire his Rain man ass</i>

30:39.537 --> 30:43.496
and get somebody in there
who does want to take your job.

30:54.219 --> 30:57.552
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just... I crashed last night.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.782
Cash is killing me about Daniel.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.485
Really? What's wrong with him?

31:01.559 --> 31:03.254
He's like Forrest fucking Gump.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.694
Without the people skills.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.731
I'm heading to Soho
right now to work on him.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.699
I thought we were going to
spend the day in the park.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.930
Beth, please. I'm being pulled
in a ton of different directions right now.

31:13.004 --> 31:17.236
Fine. But I need to be
a priority too sometimes.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.538
I'll call you later, I promise.

31:22.747 --> 31:24.374
Doesn't matter what
you talk about at first,

31:24.449 --> 31:27.350
just show the woman
that you are passionate about something.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.215
Like what?

31:29.287 --> 31:31.619
It's your life.
You tell me.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.249
I don't know.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.758
Okay. You like to read, right?

31:35.827 --> 31:38.762
- Yeah.
- What do you love to read?

31:40.064 --> 31:42.828
Dickens, Tolstoy.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.425
- I like Austen, Jane Austen.
- Okay, classics.

31:44.502 --> 31:47.164
Might be a little brainy
to start out with.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.433
So let's see, what else?

31:49.507 --> 31:53.068
I can give you the flight specs

31:53.144 --> 31:55.772
for every domestic aircraft since 1950.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.807
Classics.
Let's talk more about those.

32:00.885 --> 32:02.819
Talk about books she might like.

32:02.887 --> 32:06.220
But be careful, 'cause you can't act,
look, and talk all like the same guy.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.758
You got to mix it up.

32:07.825 --> 32:09.315
What does that mean?

32:09.394 --> 32:11.726
Just if you were a surfer,
be a surfer who likes to read.

32:11.796 --> 32:14.196
If you're a dork, be a dork
who likes to salsa dance.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.323
You know? Just...

32:15.400 --> 32:16.890
If you act boring
and you look boring,

32:16.968 --> 32:17.992
guess what?

32:18.069 --> 32:20.162
You're boring.
What are you doing?

32:20.238 --> 32:21.933
Tommy, this sounds ridiculous.

32:22.006 --> 32:23.769
It's totally fucking ridiculous,
you know?

32:23.841 --> 32:25.433
I'm not telling you
the way things should be.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.670
I'm telling you how they are.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.076
And unfortunately, a woman,
within three seconds,

32:29.147 --> 32:31.138
is going to notice whether or not
your shoes match your pants

32:31.215 --> 32:32.614
or your shirt's buttoned up too high

32:32.684 --> 32:34.174
or it's tucked in when it shouldn't be

32:34.252 --> 32:37.551
or you have a cell phone
attached to your woven belt.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.647
This is...
Look, when you were overseas,

32:39.724 --> 32:42.625
didn't you find any, like,
really cool clothes?

32:42.694 --> 32:45.288
You want me to wear
a sarong to work?

32:45.363 --> 32:48.491
Look, I can't stand guys that try
to make a statement with what they wear.

32:48.566 --> 32:50.761
- It's not me.
- Daniel.

32:50.835 --> 32:55.295
I'm not trying to turn you into some
big city, man cougar prick like Cash

32:55.373 --> 32:56.965
or any of those guys.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.303
All I'm saying is, unfortunately,

32:58.409 --> 33:00.036
what you wear does
make a statement to women,

33:00.078 --> 33:03.241
and your statement right now is,

33:03.314 --> 33:05.646
"Hi. Welcome to Blockbuster."

33:05.717 --> 33:07.708
We're going in here.

33:14.759 --> 33:15.885
Can you help this guy out?

33:15.960 --> 33:18.292
What did you have in mind

33:18.363 --> 33:21.526
for little Tommy Hilfiger here?

33:21.599 --> 33:22.998
Just something he can wear out in public.

33:23.067 --> 33:24.796
I'm right here, guys.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.803
I can hear what you're saying.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.964
Maybe something casual sexy.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.203
- Sounds about right.
- How sexy?

33:34.712 --> 33:36.179
Medium.

33:36.247 --> 33:39.239
Or small sexy.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.784
Tommy, you didn't have to pay for this.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.149
No, it's worth it.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.654
Hey, I forgot my clothes.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.280
- Yeah. Leave them.
- Yeah, but those are Banana Republic.

33:46.357 --> 33:47.346
Exactly.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.192
You still haven't told Tommy
about San Francisco?

33:56.267 --> 33:57.825
Fuck.

33:57.935 --> 33:59.630
I keep putting it off.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.264
It would just put
so much pressure on things.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.705
Yeah, but you're running out of time.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.409
God, I hope my fucking vibrator
appreciates this.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.003
Hey, isn't Lisa supposed to be here?

34:10.081 --> 34:12.708
I don't know, maybe she didn't want
to have her vagina torn off.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.184
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

34:15.253 --> 34:17.016
I'm home.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.783
Can you guys come over?

34:18.856 --> 34:21.416
- Yeah, what's wrong?
- Oh, bitch fucker.

34:21.492 --> 34:24.324
Bill left his email account
open on his computer.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.121
We'll be right there.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.826
Don't go early.
Don't go early.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.129
Don't go early.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.702
Ow, son of a bitch!

34:34.772 --> 34:37.070
Steve-O, you're at, like, a ten.

34:37.141 --> 34:40.076
I need you down
at a shut the fuck up.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.270
Fuck right off, okay?

34:41.344 --> 34:42.369
Come on, let's go again.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.608
- Does it hurt that bad?
- There you go. Shot.

34:44.681 --> 34:48.139
- Refill. Jesus.
- All right, now, everybody listen, listen.

34:48.219 --> 34:49.243
- Daniel?
- Yes.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.685
What have you learned today?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.985
To show your customers
that they want something

34:54.058 --> 34:55.786
- that you have and...
- No sales pitch, right?

34:55.860 --> 34:57.121
People see that shit coming
a mile away, right?

34:57.195 --> 34:58.492
How do you do it?

34:58.596 --> 35:00.291
Fuck me!

35:00.331 --> 35:01.958
What is wrong
with the American people?

35:02.033 --> 35:03.557
I don't know.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.623
How do you do it?

35:04.702 --> 35:05.828
- How do I do it?
- Yeah.

35:05.903 --> 35:07.666
Never kiss someone's ass.

35:07.738 --> 35:09.672
- You're better off just fucking with them.
- It's a lot more fun.

35:09.740 --> 35:13.335
Okay, so first thing Monday morning
I'm going to call all my accounts and say,

35:13.411 --> 35:16.869
"Hey, you fat fucks,
you want to buy some stock?"

35:18.483 --> 35:20.212
Was that a joke?

35:20.284 --> 35:21.842
- It was bad, I'm sorry.
- You're not even listening.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.443
- I need you to focus, okay?
- Sorry.

35:23.521 --> 35:24.920
All right, and stop apologizing so much.

35:24.989 --> 35:27.014
Sorry. Shit.

35:27.091 --> 35:29.116
Look, the reason these rules
are important is because

35:29.193 --> 35:31.184
they're the same rules
that apply to meeting women,

35:31.262 --> 35:33.162
which is even more important
for you to learn.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.722
Wait. Women don't actually
like being insulted.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.166
That's misogynist bullshit.

35:38.236 --> 35:40.033
No. What women hate

35:40.104 --> 35:41.162
is getting lied to by guys

35:41.239 --> 35:42.638
who are just trying to sleep with them.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.675
What if I'm not just
trying to sleep with them?

35:44.742 --> 35:45.674
Then you're gay.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.870
Fuck!

35:49.213 --> 35:51.374
God, that actually hurts a lot.

35:51.449 --> 35:54.179
Had to get him distracted.
Here's to Iceman...

35:54.252 --> 35:56.880
not learning anything, ever.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.216
That's a horrible game.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.153
I think my sperm count
is officially lower.

36:00.191 --> 36:01.317
Let's do it again.

36:01.392 --> 36:04.054
All I'm saying is that obviously,

36:04.128 --> 36:05.425
something was really wrong

36:05.496 --> 36:06.986
if you were already that suspicious.

36:07.064 --> 36:08.463
Oh, but that doesn't give me the right

36:08.533 --> 36:10.524
to go snooping around like that.

36:10.601 --> 36:12.262
Oh, will you listen to yourself?

36:12.336 --> 36:13.598
Your boyfriend cheats on you

36:13.671 --> 36:15.571
and you're mad at yourself
for catching him.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.403
People do make mistakes, Jordan.

36:17.475 --> 36:20.444
Locking your keys in the car
with the engine running is a mistake.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.069
Repeatedly fucking your ex-girlfriend
is not a mistake.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.238
Jordan, come on.

36:23.314 --> 36:25.248
He said it was only the one time.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.806
That is such bullshit.

36:26.884 --> 36:28.647
Infidelities are like cockroaches.

36:28.719 --> 36:30.653
For every one you catch,
there are a hundred you don't.

36:30.721 --> 36:32.712
Hey, you're not helping her right now.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.724
Can you just be supportive and not turn this

36:34.792 --> 36:36.817
into some stupid male-bashing session?

36:39.463 --> 36:41.226
Where's Tommy tonight?

36:43.768 --> 36:45.793
You know what your problem is?

36:45.870 --> 36:47.633
You wouldn't know what to do

36:47.705 --> 36:50.173
if a great guy just threw himself at you.

36:50.241 --> 36:52.175
At least I'm giving myself
a chance to be happy.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.006
Maybe use your sensitive side.

36:54.078 --> 36:55.978
- Show that off.
- Yes.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.448
Use the fact that you are
a complete pussy to your advantage.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.041
Coming from the guy
that brought the piñata and the blindfold.

37:02.086 --> 37:03.053
Hit the thing.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.217
- What's pink?
- Xanax, man.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.588
You can take whatever you want

37:08.659 --> 37:10.092
and you'll sleep like a rock.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.459
- Yellow.
- Yellow is Ecstasy.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.259
I left my glow sticks back in 1997.

37:14.332 --> 37:17.631
- What's blue?
- Blue's Viagra.

37:17.702 --> 37:18.760
It's perfect for you.

37:18.836 --> 37:21.532
- I'm good, thanks.
- No, my friend.

37:21.606 --> 37:24.131
Power up, okay?
Like, the ladies expect it these days.

37:24.208 --> 37:26.039
Never take a knife
to a gunfight, mate.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.635
Gunfight. That's a nice metaphor.

37:28.713 --> 37:30.578
Don't listen to these guys.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.879
No tourists.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.715
You ready to be released
into the wild?

37:59.377 --> 38:01.106
Hey, guys.

38:01.178 --> 38:03.203
We got everybody.

38:18.095 --> 38:20.290
No, honey, we don't need these.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.932
She's beautiful.

38:25.002 --> 38:26.196
You think so?

38:26.270 --> 38:27.635
- Yeah.
- You should tell her.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.036
Do you have water?

38:29.106 --> 38:31.040
I'm sure she gets hit on
all the time, though.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.201
You're probably right,
she probably does get hit on all the time

38:33.277 --> 38:34.972
by guys who don't
actually care, you know,

38:35.046 --> 38:36.843
if she's a Gemini
or what her cat's name is.

38:36.914 --> 38:38.973
But I'm not asking you to go over there
and feed her a line.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.847
I just want you to go talk to her.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.613
You keep telling me what
I'm not supposed to do.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.177
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.450
I'm in the low self-esteem business.

38:46.524 --> 38:49.220
If a girl's parents are still together,
I just move on.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.454
Doesn't really matter
what I say to women.

38:51.529 --> 38:52.962
I have an English accent.

38:53.030 --> 38:55.055
You know what? All right.

38:55.132 --> 38:57.566
Two girls, end of the bar.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.760
Go talk to them.

39:01.205 --> 39:02.536
Okay.

39:04.709 --> 39:07.143
- What, right now?
- Yeah, right now.

39:07.211 --> 39:08.235
Which one do you like better?

39:08.312 --> 39:09.336
I don't know.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.180
Blonde, I guess.

39:12.249 --> 39:13.716
- Rookie.
- Totally.

39:13.784 --> 39:17.015
No questions.
No questions, just go.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.022
Go.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.284
Wait, come back.
Come back.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.484
- What?
- That right there.

39:21.559 --> 39:24.119
What is that?
I told you about that.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.662
Okay, now go.

39:25.730 --> 39:28.893
Do you actually believe
any of that shit you just said?

39:28.966 --> 39:30.797
- Some of it.
- You think he's going to pull it off?

39:30.868 --> 39:32.130
Not a fucking prayer.

39:38.876 --> 39:39.865
Excuse me.

39:44.281 --> 39:47.079
Pass me a napkin? Please?

39:48.319 --> 39:49.286
Thank you.

39:50.855 --> 39:51.879
De-entry.

39:56.427 --> 39:57.359
I feel stupid.

39:57.428 --> 39:58.360
You look stupid.

39:58.429 --> 39:59.726
Let me get this straight, Daniel.

39:59.797 --> 40:03.255
Okay? You could fly a jet
at Mach 3 speeds

40:03.334 --> 40:05.598
for, like, 72 hours with a plastic tube
up your cock,

40:05.669 --> 40:07.637
but you can't go talk
to two dental hygienists

40:07.705 --> 40:11.436
- for 10 seconds.
- Actually, I was an avionics engineer.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.238
- We never had...
- No. I don't... No excuses.

40:13.310 --> 40:14.572
You got to be able to do this.

40:14.645 --> 40:15.703
You have to.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.145
What about that one over there?

40:17.214 --> 40:19.944
- Oh, totally gross.
- And what about the blonde over there?

40:20.017 --> 40:21.484
I want to touch her where she pees.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.144
That is a good-looking white girl.

40:23.220 --> 40:24.585
Ring. Ring.

40:24.655 --> 40:25.986
Oh, fuck, you're right.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.956
Oh, how 'bout that one?

40:28.025 --> 40:30.289
- That's a handsome woman.
- Look at her ass.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.726
She might as well have a tail,

40:31.796 --> 40:32.785
and she's ugly.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.160
You know, some people
might say the way

40:34.231 --> 40:35.596
you guys talk about women is ugly.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.829
Yeah, but we're only ugly
on the inside, so it's okay.

40:38.903 --> 40:42.430
Oh, that... that is a beautiful woman.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.100
She totally wants to have
a sexy party with me.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.406
She does not want to have
a sexy party with you.

40:47.478 --> 40:49.503
She wants to have
a sexy party with me.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.811
Steve-O, fine.
Go ahead. Talk to her.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.647
But none of that shock and awe bullshit
you usually pull.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.346
Someone has to show
Danny how to do this, okay?

40:57.421 --> 41:00.356
- You don't have to...
- I don't do that shit anymore, okay?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.823
Sexy party.

41:01.859 --> 41:04.191
Okay. None of that scorched earth bullshit.
I'm serious.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.362
Well, hello there, Rodeo.
Who's up for a Jaeger bomb?

41:11.635 --> 41:13.296
I don't think she's having it, mate.

41:13.370 --> 41:15.531
A Grey Goose and soda?
Yeah, just one.

41:15.606 --> 41:17.836
How 'bout you go talk to her?

41:17.908 --> 41:20.536
I don't think Cindy Brady's
coming over to the dark side tonight.

41:20.611 --> 41:22.545
I'm going to go take a hot lap.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.376
Thanks for the help, Shakes.

41:24.448 --> 41:26.939
Well, your turn.

41:27.017 --> 41:29.884
- No. No.
- Your turn.

41:29.954 --> 41:31.945
Okay, fine. Okay.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.956
But remember, this is
not about sexy parties or...

41:34.024 --> 41:35.616
Whatever, just go talk to her.

41:35.693 --> 41:38.423
I'm going to get
a front-row seat. Okay?

41:40.631 --> 41:41.893
I'm Steven, by the way.

41:41.966 --> 41:43.365
- I'm Brooke.
- Great.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.664
You look really professional up there.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.294
By which I mean you're, like, hot.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.362
Like, really hot.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.032
Another napkin.

41:51.108 --> 41:52.973
Where's the bartender?

41:53.043 --> 41:55.136
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Yeah, you actually...

41:55.212 --> 41:57.703
- No, not at all. Hi.
- Hi.

41:57.815 --> 41:59.373
Tommy.

42:00.417 --> 42:03.181
- Yeah, This is Bl...
- I'm Brooke.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.346
- Blake?
- Brooke.

42:04.421 --> 42:05.581
- Brooke.
- Brooke.

42:05.656 --> 42:08.022
- Tommy. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

42:08.092 --> 42:09.923
So, how do you two
know each other?

42:09.994 --> 42:11.825
- Oh, we...
- Work.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.761
You write children's books too?

42:13.831 --> 42:16.959
Yeah. He does instructional guides

42:17.034 --> 42:19.093
for swing sets.

42:25.175 --> 42:27.871
- Well...
- Dude, that's my...

42:27.945 --> 42:30.778
Obviously, I'm not going to
have sex with this girl tonight,

42:30.848 --> 42:33.442
so why don't you give it a shot?

42:35.219 --> 42:36.618
I am so sorry about that.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.177
What an asshole.

42:38.255 --> 42:41.588
- Yeah, I...
- What, you guys work on Wall Street?

42:41.659 --> 42:44.651
Yeah, we do,
but not all of us are like...

42:44.728 --> 42:46.389
You know what?

42:46.463 --> 42:47.987
Let's start over.
I am Tommy.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.260
And I owe you a drink.

42:54.972 --> 42:56.064
I'm Brooke.

42:57.207 --> 42:59.107
It's a pleasure to meet you.

42:59.209 --> 43:02.906
Personally, I think there's
nothing wrong with bulimia at all.

43:02.947 --> 43:07.748
If anything, it shows your willingness
to revaluate your decisions

43:07.818 --> 43:12.585
and be proactive about making changes.

43:12.656 --> 43:14.851
You don't sound black at all.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.419
Are you from Europe?

43:18.495 --> 43:21.828
Here goes Jonathan,
looking to break some records.

43:24.535 --> 43:27.402
- Yeah!
- Here we go!

43:27.471 --> 43:29.132
That's got to hurt.

43:29.206 --> 43:30.867
It doesn't look innocent,
it looks like heroin addict.

43:30.941 --> 43:33.603
Hey, give me.

43:33.677 --> 43:35.611
Here.

43:35.679 --> 43:37.442
What if he really is sorry?

43:37.514 --> 43:39.414
Everyone is sorry once they're caught.
It doesn't mean anything.

43:39.483 --> 43:41.178
It's true.
Rich said he would leave his wife

43:41.251 --> 43:43.310
after I found out he was married.

43:43.387 --> 43:45.014
All's fair in love and war.

43:45.089 --> 43:46.852
Are you retarded?

43:46.924 --> 43:49.722
That's just a bullshit excuse
people use to screw whoever they want.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.488
They need Guantanamo Bay
for relationships.

43:51.562 --> 43:54.030
I'd water board the fuck
out of my ex in Love Gismo.

43:54.098 --> 43:55.463
Good for you.
This is for work.

43:55.532 --> 43:58.262
Hey, you know what?
Tommy just hired a new guy on his desk.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.031
Really? Is he cute?

44:01.071 --> 44:04.700
He didn't say,
which actually probably means he's cute.

44:04.775 --> 44:06.436
I'll find a way to bring him around.

44:06.510 --> 44:07.977
Put this on.

44:08.045 --> 44:10.605
Do I really have to
go out with you guys?

44:10.681 --> 44:12.649
Yes.

44:12.716 --> 44:15.048
Whose bachelorette party
is this, anyway?

44:16.954 --> 44:22.483
Look, I just felt that if we had met
under different circumstances,

44:22.559 --> 44:26.120
just a few weeks ago,
that this could have been something,

44:26.196 --> 44:29.461
like, really amazing.

44:29.533 --> 44:31.194
- I mean...
- I know.

44:31.268 --> 44:34.203
It's crazy, isn't it?

44:34.271 --> 44:35.499
- Yeah.
- Oh.

44:38.742 --> 44:40.573
Can you get my bag?
Thank you.

44:40.644 --> 44:42.509
I love you guys.

44:42.579 --> 44:43.944
I love you.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.174
Thank you.

44:48.252 --> 44:52.416
That could have been
Bad News Bears.

44:57.394 --> 45:00.591
Here's where things started
to get complicated.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.098
Brooke lost her purse
that night at the bar.

45:03.133 --> 45:06.660
Her phone, her keys, everything.

45:06.737 --> 45:08.705
She asked if she could crash on my couch

45:08.772 --> 45:10.501
and call a locksmith in the morning.

45:12.042 --> 45:15.136
I know I really could have
just put my foot down,

45:15.212 --> 45:19.512
but I didn't.

45:19.583 --> 45:20.845
I'm going to get going.

45:20.918 --> 45:22.112
Okay.

45:24.922 --> 45:25.946
Thanks.

45:27.091 --> 45:28.683
No sweat.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.522
I've always believed that trust

45:30.594 --> 45:32.892
is the single most important thing
in a relationship.

45:32.963 --> 45:35.932
But given that nothing happened,

45:35.999 --> 45:38.194
I decided not to tell Beth.

45:42.039 --> 45:43.904
Hey, hotshot.

45:43.974 --> 45:45.441
Cash, good to see you.

45:45.509 --> 45:47.477
Hello, Beth.
My, you're more lovely than I remember.

45:47.544 --> 45:49.171
Oh, aren't you a sweet talker.

45:49.246 --> 45:52.704
Look at that.
That necklace is gorgeous.

45:52.783 --> 45:55.411
- Look at that thing.
- It was a gift, actually.

45:55.486 --> 45:58.114
- Was it? You picked that out?
- Yes, I did.

45:58.222 --> 46:00.087
- I'm shocked.
- Just a little something.

46:00.124 --> 46:02.354
Oh, you haven't met Beth yet,
have you?

46:02.426 --> 46:03.916
Not officially.

46:03.994 --> 46:05.325
I'm surprised at your taste.

46:05.395 --> 46:08.523
- She's really nice.
- Yeah.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.861
I'm sure.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.764
Okay, who takes the same
bus to work every day?

46:14.838 --> 46:16.499
No, what are you talking about, man?

46:16.573 --> 46:18.507
Stephen's wife is beautiful.

46:18.575 --> 46:20.839
All I'm saying is he passed up
20 good years

46:20.911 --> 46:22.640
of man-whoring.

46:22.713 --> 46:23.873
He could have put up
Wilt Chamberlain numbers

46:23.947 --> 46:24.936
and then retired.

46:25.015 --> 46:26.539
Yeah, he looks miserable.

46:27.584 --> 46:29.643
Anyone need a drink?

46:29.720 --> 46:31.654
- So, you came here with Tommy?
- Yeah.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.155
So, how long have you guys been dating?

46:33.223 --> 46:35.691
It's been three months now.

46:35.759 --> 46:38.853
That long?
Oh, I didn't realize that.

46:38.929 --> 46:41.124
Time flies.

46:41.198 --> 46:42.756
Diet Coke, please.

46:42.833 --> 46:44.357
Oh, will you excuse me for a second?

46:44.434 --> 46:46.402
Sure.

46:51.875 --> 46:53.001
Thank you.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.311
Hitting the hard stuff, huh?

47:00.184 --> 47:04.917
Yeah. Saving the table dancing
for the holiday party.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.580
You must be Daniel.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.625
It's so funny.
I'm Beth, Tommy's girlfriend.

47:08.692 --> 47:10.023
Yeah, I figured.

47:10.093 --> 47:12.618
Well, it's nice to meet you.

47:12.696 --> 47:14.425
You too.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.591
- Again.
- Again.

47:20.470 --> 47:23.200
You look different.

47:28.278 --> 47:30.838
So, how did you
and Tommy meet again?

47:30.914 --> 47:32.745
I was out one night with my friend Jordan,

47:32.816 --> 47:35.011
and he was obviously on a date.

47:35.085 --> 47:37.053
- That's trouble.
- Yeah.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.611
Well, he left, but he came
back in the restaurant

47:39.690 --> 47:41.749
and told me that he wanted
to be talking to me.

47:41.825 --> 47:43.190
And ever since then...

47:43.260 --> 47:45.353
Tommy, he's a great guy.

47:45.429 --> 47:47.397
Yeah, he's great.

47:47.464 --> 47:49.557
Tommy says you're a big reader.

47:49.633 --> 47:50.622
What's your favourite book?

47:52.436 --> 47:54.495
<i>Well, have you ever read
Pride and Prejudice?</i>

47:54.571 --> 47:57.506
- Really?
- See, you're laughing.

47:57.608 --> 48:00.372
No. It's just why do guys
always pick that book?

48:00.410 --> 48:01.877
I mean, is it in a manual somewhere

48:01.945 --> 48:03.606
on how to speak to women or...

48:03.680 --> 48:05.739
No. I like it because

48:05.816 --> 48:08.011
it shows how wrong
first impressions can be.

48:08.085 --> 48:09.450
You know?

48:09.519 --> 48:13.046
And also, the main character,
Elizabeth Bennett...

48:13.123 --> 48:14.954
Sounds stupid, but she's,
like, my ideal woman.

48:15.025 --> 48:17.118
<i>Have you ever read Lolita?</i>

48:18.662 --> 48:20.254
"Lolita, my sin, my soul,

48:20.330 --> 48:22.924
standing four feet ten in one sock."

48:23.000 --> 48:25.400
Hey, you should come to my book club
on Tuesday night.

48:25.469 --> 48:28.870
I think it would be really great
to have a guy for this one.

48:28.939 --> 48:30.201
What about Tommy?

48:30.274 --> 48:32.299
Oh, Tommy would never come.

48:32.376 --> 48:34.310
Plus, there's kind of a no-boyfriend rule.

48:34.378 --> 48:35.936
Yeah.

48:36.013 --> 48:37.002
Sounds like fun.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.570
I'm going to have to
politely decline, though.

48:38.649 --> 48:39.638
Oh, come on.

48:39.716 --> 48:42.742
Just you and five cute girls
and a lot of wine.

48:42.819 --> 48:43.979
- Tommy.
- Hey.

48:44.054 --> 48:45.487
See you saved me
the trouble of introductions.

48:45.555 --> 48:46.681
Yeah, good timing.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.816
You have to convince Daniel
to come to my book club.

48:48.892 --> 48:50.655
- Book club.
- Yeah.

48:50.727 --> 48:51.955
That sounds like a great idea.

48:52.029 --> 48:54.054
Really? Why?

48:54.131 --> 48:55.826
First of all, you would be talking
to actual women,

48:55.899 --> 48:56.957
even if it is about books.

48:57.034 --> 48:59.662
Well, come on. I'm sure
he does just fine with the ladies.

48:59.770 --> 49:02.466
- Don't you?
- Not really, no.

49:02.506 --> 49:04.940
And secondly, it would give
me endless opportunities to fuck with you.

49:05.008 --> 49:06.999
That's why I don't think
it's a really good idea.

49:11.982 --> 49:13.006
Good morning, soldier.

49:14.351 --> 49:16.182
Morning.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.414
What are you reading?

49:18.488 --> 49:20.319
Oh, just a book.

49:22.225 --> 49:23.920
What book?

49:23.994 --> 49:25.655
- It's nothing.
- What book?

49:25.729 --> 49:27.560
What is the t...

49:27.631 --> 49:28.757
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

49:28.832 --> 49:30.697
Put that away. Jesus.

49:30.767 --> 49:32.997
What are you,
carpooling with Oprah?

49:37.140 --> 49:38.505
Met a woman...

49:39.876 --> 49:42.037
She reminds me
of the character in the book.

49:44.247 --> 49:48.377
You're doing really lovely
with those language tapes, Jan.

49:50.587 --> 49:51.645
So when you say cute,

49:51.722 --> 49:52.689
do you mean, like,

49:52.756 --> 49:54.189
little kid with gum in his hair cute

49:54.257 --> 49:56.782
- or Brad Pitt cute?
- Somewhere in-between.

49:56.860 --> 49:59.761
<i>See, I don't want this turning into some
lame episode of The Bachelor.</i>

49:59.830 --> 50:02.025
Hey, I thought women were supposed
to love men in uniform.

50:02.099 --> 50:04.260
Yeah, government salaries
and post-traumatic stress

50:04.334 --> 50:05.528
really do it to me nasty.

50:05.602 --> 50:08.196
And we've met Tommy's work friends.

50:08.271 --> 50:09.533
No, but he's nothing like those guys.

50:09.606 --> 50:11.733
If anything, he's too old-fashioned.

50:11.808 --> 50:14.299
What, he still prefers vaginal sex?

50:14.378 --> 50:15.902
Ooh, old school, yeah.

50:17.381 --> 50:18.348
You said you invited him later.

50:18.415 --> 50:19.541
I did.

50:19.616 --> 50:21.379
Oh, I need my...

50:21.451 --> 50:23.715
- Okay, come on, girl.
- Just think about this as a tryout.

50:23.787 --> 50:25.311
You guys are pathetic.

50:25.389 --> 50:27.254
- You look cute. You're adorable.
- Thank you.

50:27.324 --> 50:28.723
Hello.

50:28.792 --> 50:29.781
It's Daniel.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.691
He's polite and early.

50:31.762 --> 50:34.162
- Yeah, he's gay.
- He's not gay.

50:34.231 --> 50:35.721
- He was in the military.
- Gay.

50:35.799 --> 50:36.857
Yeah, don't ask, don't tell.

50:38.802 --> 50:39.962
- Hey.
- Hi.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.436
Come on in.

50:41.505 --> 50:43.996
I got you this.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.235
- Oh, thank you.
- It's wine.

50:46.309 --> 50:49.244
Yeah. So, you have
to meet everybody.

50:49.312 --> 50:53.578
Daniel, this is Lisa,
Jordan, Susan, and Jill.

50:53.650 --> 50:54.742
Hi, everyone.

50:54.818 --> 50:55.978
Hi.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.486
Sorry I'm so early.

50:59.189 --> 51:01.282
No, no.
We were just having some girl talk.

51:01.358 --> 51:03.053
- Just sat down.
- Well, I can just come back

51:03.126 --> 51:05.117
- if you guys are...
- No, please.

51:05.195 --> 51:07.163
- Sit.
- Yeah, come on.

51:10.333 --> 51:13.029
And apparently, they've
never seen a man before.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.298
Ever.

51:16.373 --> 51:18.273
I know it's a classic,
but I can't get past

51:18.341 --> 51:19.774
this old, Euro-trash pervert

51:19.843 --> 51:21.003
screwing a 12-year-old
from New Hampshire.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.376
- It's disgusting.
- And the way he bribes her for sex

51:23.447 --> 51:25.381
with candy
and pocket change?

51:25.449 --> 51:27.383
Daniel, you've been awfully quiet.

51:27.451 --> 51:29.476
Have we scared you out of talking?

51:29.553 --> 51:33.455
Well, I can't disagree
with what's been said so far.

51:33.523 --> 51:36.754
Obviously, yeah,
the guy is really troubled.

51:36.827 --> 51:38.385
- And he's...
- Pervert. Paedophile.

51:38.462 --> 51:39.759
Let him finish.

51:39.830 --> 51:45.462
Yes. But I believe that
he was hopelessly in love.

51:45.535 --> 51:46.627
You know, doesn't make it okay,

51:46.703 --> 51:49.501
but he's not just a pervert.

51:49.573 --> 51:51.939
- Yeah. He's a murderer too.
- Okay, all right.

51:52.008 --> 51:54.272
Years later, he kills the man
that stole his Lolita.

51:54.344 --> 51:57.370
But he loved her more than anything.

51:57.447 --> 51:59.278
Even his own life.

52:00.517 --> 52:02.644
I think that's what love is.

52:02.719 --> 52:04.653
Anything else is just...

52:04.721 --> 52:06.848
a distraction.

52:11.895 --> 52:13.760
Should we choose another book?

52:13.830 --> 52:15.229
- For next time?
- Yeah.

52:15.298 --> 52:16.993
Will you be able to join us next time?

52:17.067 --> 52:19.194
Uh, okay,

52:19.269 --> 52:22.705
but I kind of got the feeling
tonight was sort of a tryout.

52:22.772 --> 52:24.034
Oh, no.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.131
- No.
- No.

52:25.208 --> 52:27.540
- You passed.
- Yeah, sure.

52:27.611 --> 52:30.842
You guys can be like
the sisters I never wanted.

52:32.115 --> 52:33.707
- Thanks. Lovely.
- Nice.

52:33.783 --> 52:36.217
<i>All right. Well then, is everybody okay
with The Good Soldier?</i>

52:36.286 --> 52:38.447
No. I don't really want
to read a war novel.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.319
Oh, no, but it's
a love story, isn't it?

52:40.390 --> 52:42.358
Well, here.

52:42.425 --> 52:44.655
"This heartbreaking novel
of infidelity and betrayal

52:44.728 --> 52:46.753
"tells the story of an ex-soldier

52:46.830 --> 52:48.491
"and seemingly perfect gentleman.

52:48.565 --> 52:51.227
"'He was just the sort of man
you could trust your wife with,'

52:51.301 --> 52:54.862
says the tragic narrator of the story."

52:55.805 --> 52:57.602
- There you go.
- Thanks.

52:59.109 --> 53:02.442
Actually...

53:02.512 --> 53:05.640
You're a total neat freak, aren't you?

53:05.715 --> 53:08.980
Actually, my apartment's a mess.

53:09.052 --> 53:12.021
Therapy for all those years of me
spit-shining my shoes.

53:12.088 --> 53:14.249
I cannot picture you in the military.

53:14.324 --> 53:15.552
What does that mean?

53:15.625 --> 53:16.751
I don't know.

53:16.826 --> 53:20.785
You just don't seem very aggressive.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.593
Are you kidding me?

53:22.666 --> 53:24.725
I was an avionics engineer.

53:24.801 --> 53:27.167
- Were you?
- Yeah.

53:27.237 --> 53:28.226
Super-aggressive.

53:29.606 --> 53:32.598
No. My dad, he was in the Air Force,

53:32.676 --> 53:36.009
and the only way I could
afford Princeton was ROTC.

53:36.079 --> 53:39.310
Get up every morning at 6 A. M.,

53:39.382 --> 53:43.079
do some push ups,
they pay for school.

53:43.153 --> 53:44.984
But you didn't finish your service, right?

53:45.055 --> 53:46.522
Tommy said you dropped out.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.419
I didn't mean it like that.

53:49.492 --> 53:51.221
No, it's okay. I...

53:53.863 --> 53:56.730
You have to serve
four years after college

53:56.800 --> 53:58.131
in order to get your loans paid off,

53:58.235 --> 54:01.636
and my commanding officer
served with my dad,

54:01.671 --> 54:04.504
and after three years,
I had some...

54:04.574 --> 54:06.542
I just had some stuff that happened.

54:06.610 --> 54:09.511
And he agreed to get me discharged a year
early.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.945
That's good.

54:12.015 --> 54:12.982
- I think.
- No.

54:13.049 --> 54:14.676
No, it was at the time.

54:14.751 --> 54:18.448
But now I've got a hundred grand
in student loans to pay off.

54:18.521 --> 54:21.456
- God.
- Lot of push ups for nothing.

54:21.524 --> 54:24.960
Well, I wouldn't say nothing.

54:29.332 --> 54:32.233
That would be Tommy.

54:34.671 --> 54:35.933
Hey, come on up.

54:39.476 --> 54:41.467
Guess I should get going, huh?

54:41.544 --> 54:44.672
Okay. Well, I'm so glad
you could make it.

54:44.748 --> 54:47.012
And thank you
for offering to clean up.

54:47.083 --> 54:49.449
- It was nice.
- Yeah.

54:49.519 --> 54:51.419
Hey, guys.

54:51.488 --> 54:53.183
How was book club?

54:55.225 --> 54:56.453
It was good.

55:05.135 --> 55:08.798
Are you ever actually
going to want to leave this city?

55:08.872 --> 55:11.340
Someday, yeah.

55:11.408 --> 55:12.807
Come on, babe, it's late.

55:20.283 --> 55:24.777
My aunt and uncle used to be
these big-shot lawyers.

55:26.389 --> 55:29.790
Working hundred-hour weeks
and never getting to see each other.

55:29.859 --> 55:32.293
One day, they just moved to Colorado

55:32.362 --> 55:34.796
to run this hot air balloon company.

55:34.864 --> 55:37.389
That's great.
Good for them.

55:37.467 --> 55:39.867
It is.

55:39.936 --> 55:41.904
They take people up to watch the sunset

55:41.971 --> 55:44.132
over the Rockies every night.

55:44.207 --> 55:45.572
They get by okay,

55:45.642 --> 55:49.908
and they get to see
each other every day.

55:49.979 --> 55:52.709
And he hasn't thrown her
out of the basket yet?

55:55.518 --> 55:58.351
Come on, babe.
Let's go to sleep.

56:14.037 --> 56:17.063
I was offered a promotion
in San Francisco.

56:23.680 --> 56:27.013
And can you make sure
they arrive this afternoon?

56:27.083 --> 56:28.675
They need to be there
when he gets home.

56:28.752 --> 56:30.481
As long as there's a doorman, sure.

56:30.553 --> 56:31.952
Did you want to fill out a card?

56:32.021 --> 56:33.716
Yes.

56:45.668 --> 56:47.226
You like flowers.
Why don't you just keep them?

56:47.303 --> 56:48.634
This isn't funny.

56:48.705 --> 56:50.969
"Happy Anniversary"?
This has to stop.

56:52.776 --> 56:56.007
I guess I did meet her
about this time last year.

56:56.079 --> 56:57.512
Beth, Beth,

56:57.614 --> 56:59.479
you're mad at me,
and that's exactly what Christie wants.

56:59.516 --> 57:01.143
This has nothing to do with us.

57:01.217 --> 57:02.309
Of course it does.

57:02.385 --> 57:04.649
"We all have a past."
Remember?

57:04.721 --> 57:06.746
I dealt with mine.
You are not dealing with yours.

57:06.823 --> 57:08.347
What else do you want me to do?

57:08.425 --> 57:10.655
I can get a restraining order.

57:10.727 --> 57:12.752
How does one actually do that?

57:12.829 --> 57:14.592
I'm tired of this.
Honestly.

57:33.950 --> 57:34.974
Hello.

57:35.051 --> 57:36.109
Hi.

57:36.186 --> 57:37.949
What's for dinner?

57:39.656 --> 57:42.216
Just peanut butter...

57:42.292 --> 57:44.123
sandwiches.

57:44.194 --> 57:45.684
All right.

57:45.762 --> 57:47.957
Hey, Tommy and Lisa and I

57:48.031 --> 57:49.123
are going for dinner next week

57:49.199 --> 57:50.393
and we wanted to invite you along.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.491
I can't.

57:51.568 --> 57:53.934
I didn't even say which night yet.

57:54.003 --> 57:57.336
Uh, no. I just, um...

57:57.407 --> 57:58.931
I don't like to be set up.

57:59.008 --> 58:01.442
Oh. Well, it's not a setup.

58:01.511 --> 58:03.308
How's Monday night?

58:03.379 --> 58:05.210
We're going for sushi.
It's better than peanut butter.

58:05.281 --> 58:06.612
Yeah, uh...

58:06.683 --> 58:08.412
I think I could do Monday.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.543
- Okay.
- Sure.

58:09.619 --> 58:11.849
- Good.
- Huh.

58:11.921 --> 58:14.048
What are you doing home
on a Friday night anyway?

58:14.123 --> 58:16.318
Oh, it's just been
kind of a long week.

58:16.392 --> 58:17.620
What's your excuse?

58:17.694 --> 58:19.855
I'm meeting Tommy later.

58:21.264 --> 58:22.253
So, what's your story?

58:22.332 --> 58:23.731
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

58:23.800 --> 58:27.759
Well, my ex-girlfriend,

58:27.837 --> 58:31.671
uh, fiancée, she got pregnant
while I was serving overseas.

58:31.741 --> 58:33.174
She visited you over there?

58:33.243 --> 58:34.232
No.

58:34.310 --> 58:36.244
No, that was kind of the problem.

58:37.413 --> 58:39.506
Oh. Sorry.

58:39.582 --> 58:41.174
Well, it's not really the homecoming

58:41.651 --> 58:43.881
I'd been looking forward to
for three years, you know?

58:43.953 --> 58:44.977
Right.

58:46.122 --> 58:48.682
So, are you interested
in anyone these days?

58:50.393 --> 58:54.193
Interested like, um...

58:54.264 --> 58:55.253
No, no, not...

58:55.331 --> 58:56.889
That's a yes.

58:56.966 --> 58:58.365
Who is she?
Do I know her?

59:00.970 --> 59:03.268
I don't think you do, Beth.

59:13.449 --> 59:15.781
All right, say when.

59:15.852 --> 59:17.683
It's a school night.

59:17.754 --> 59:19.381
You know?

59:19.455 --> 59:21.787
It's okay, I don't have to be
at work until late tomorrow.

59:23.459 --> 59:25.791
So, what was your favourite
country that you visited?

59:26.863 --> 59:27.887
Oh, I don't know.

59:27.964 --> 59:30.296
Botswana, maybe.

59:30.366 --> 59:31.458
No, Vietnam.

59:31.534 --> 59:34.594
People there are so nice.

59:34.671 --> 59:36.935
Beaches are just amazing,

59:37.006 --> 59:39.941
and it's like a million
dong to the dollar,

59:40.009 --> 59:41.442
so it's really cheap.

59:41.511 --> 59:43.206
A million dongs to a dollar, huh?

59:43.279 --> 59:44.769
Sounds like a good time.

59:49.152 --> 59:51.052
So, what was Botswana like?

59:51.120 --> 59:53.054
Okay.

59:53.122 --> 59:56.091
Picture herds of zebra and elephant,

59:56.159 --> 59:58.218
literally just stopping traffic on highways.

59:58.294 --> 01:00:01.161
And the currency there

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.255
actually, it's called the pula,

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.961
which is the same word as rain.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.059
Oh, 'cause of the droughts.

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.398
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:10.996
And the pennies,
they're called raindrops.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.974
So poetic.

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.441
It is.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.636
Aren't you drinking?

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:18.943
- Oh, yeah.
- Never pour your own sake.

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:22.712
Seven years bad sex.
That's a fact.

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:23.843
Seven more years, huh?

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.450
School night.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:32.157
Oops.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.189
Let's have a toast.

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:40.598
To Daniel's success in his new job.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.468
And to Lisa's promotion.

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.473
And to Beth, for organizing tonight.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:48.009
Yes, here's to everyone.
Except me.

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.912
Beth, what are you going to do
about that job offer in California?

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.283
Well, it's such a great opportunity,

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:01.186
but part of me feels
like I shouldn't go.

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.283
When would you be moving?

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.827
Probably in about a month.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.192
Yeah. I'd miss her like crazy,

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.663
but it's only a plane ride, right?

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.393
Yeah. I mean, it's not that far.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.367
I just can't make up my mind.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.197
I know how you can figure it out.

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:20.072
This...

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.543
can show you exactly
what you want, deep down.

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.206
Yeah, let's leave all of life's
major decisions to a coin toss.

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:26.942
That's brilliant, Daniel.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.415
I don't really believe in luck.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:29.508
No, it's not about luck.

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:30.574
Okay?

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:33.144
Heads you stay, tails you go.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.914
You got to trust me, though, okay?

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.120
- This is ridiculous.
- Heads you stay, tails you go.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.826
What do you want it to be?

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.899
Stay.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.866
Then that's your answer.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.405
What was it really?

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.674
What was it?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.549
Doesn't matter.

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.085
Dude, you looked at it.
Come on.

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:05.916
That's not the point.
She knows what she wants now.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:08.081
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.159
Thanks for dinner, Tommy.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.032
- Yes.
- Yes, very generous, as always.

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:23.971
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.770
Shit. I left my credit card inside.

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:29.038
Be right back.

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.472
- I think I'm going to call it a night.
- Oh, okay.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.744
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.048
Do you want to share a cab?

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.682
No.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.953
I'm headed downtown,
you're headed Upper West, right?

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:45.288
Yeah.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:46.828
Wouldn't make sense, you know?

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.796
Logistically.

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:51.493
Got it. What's the plan?

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.057
I'm just going to call it a night.

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:54.763
- Thanks for everything, man.
- Really?

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:55.963
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.528
You guys have a good night, all right?

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.664
- You too.
- Yeah, right. Good night.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.539
Take care.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.910
What's the 10-spot, 45?

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:11.510
I'm not trying to bend you over, okay?

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.282
Just grow a pair of nuts and lift me.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.789
I still need a better bid from Northrop.

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:15.789
Daniel, you're up on Cyber on.

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.018
All right, take a report.

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:20.187
Hundred thou?
A nickel better than your order.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.390
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.989
Jack, stick with me on this one.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.931
- Did you hear me?
- Get him to fucking hit me.

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.770
All right, Jack,
we just got another seller.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:37.438
It's fill or kill.
What do you want to do?

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:43.477
Great. I'll have Jen
call you with the report.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.020
Have fun in the Hamptons.

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:46.884
Yep.

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.048
Done your way, Shakespeare.

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.614
Thank you, Denial.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:50.624
Jen.

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.320
I'm all over it, Denial.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.574
You know, it's kind of sad
if you think about it.

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:08.041
Those guys spend all their time

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:12.570
looking for something
they're never going to find.

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.582
What? The perfect woman?

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.585
Yeah, there's no such thing.

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.885
So you've never been tempted, huh?

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:26.054
Well, I mean, of course
I've been tempted.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:29.188
Why? Does that surprise you?

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.926
I can go home at night,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.297
I can look at my wife

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.734
and my kids in the eye,

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.863
not feel like a total fraud.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.701
I mean, to me,
that's a good trade.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.857
Daniel. How's it going?

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:06.995
Good to see you, man.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.593
Hi, Daniel.
I'm Christie.

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.070
I've heard a lot about you.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:11.663
Yeah, you too.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.834
Yeah. So, Daniel and I have a meeting

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:14.842
we got to get up to.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.606
So I'll see you later.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:19.079
Okay. Bye.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.353
Sorry about that.
She's a little nuts

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:28.049
and I had to stop her
from coming upstairs.

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:30.422
- It's okay. It's fine.
- But you show up in the nick of time.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:31.960
It's good.
This is good.

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:34.462
And I know you and Beth
are becoming real good friends.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.656
I think that's cool and everything.

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:38.666
This is probably something
she doesn't need to hear about,

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:42.568
unless you're trying to split us up

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:45.698
for some reason.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.609
Fucking with you.

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.374
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:08.123
Hi, it's Tommy.
Leave a message.

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.217
Hey, Beth.

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:14.455
Hey. Where are you?

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.327
I'm at home.

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.560
Tommy said you guys had
an important dinner tonight.

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:22.195
well, I guess
I'm not that important.

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:26.874
- Did you finish the book yet?
- Yeah.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.375
I just did.

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.912
I'm not sure how
I feel about it, though.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.107
What do you mean?

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:37.846
Well, you kind of
just trust the narrator

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.547
out of habit, you know?

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.920
But just as you're getting into it,

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:44.050
he just turns out to be full of shit.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.094
Yeah, so?

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.255
What's the point of that?

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.898
Maybe it's just like real life.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:59.030
Sometimes, people just aren't
who you thought they were.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.536
You'd tell me if...

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.808
if something were going on
with Tommy, right?

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.612
Yeah, if I knew anything.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:14.053
I mean, there's no stupid guy code
or anything, is there?

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.515
Don't say anything
to Tommy, okay?

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:18.924
No, of course not.

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:20.426
Thanks.

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:21.758
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.129
Do you want to come get a drink
with me and my friends?

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.792
I can't, Beth.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:29.437
I'm kind of expecting someone.

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.099
Oh. Okay.

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:35.575
Well, have fun tonight.

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:36.975
Whatever you're doing. And...

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:40.106
Well, you know, not too much fun.

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:42.877
Ha-ha.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:43.975
I'll talk to you later.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:46.680
Okay. Bye.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.417
Hello.

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.928
Delivery for Mr. Daniel.

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:55.964
Yep, come on up.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.997
Doesn't this place have any boys?

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:02.662
You should call Daniel.
What's up with Daniel tonight?

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:05.366
I don't know. It's...

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.001
It sounded like he had
some hot date coming over.

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:11.479
Yeah. Somehow I doubt that.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:13.207
Why? What does that mean?

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:14.874
The guy is totally in love with you.

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.314
Why didn't he come tonight, then?

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.875
You're his boss's girlfriend.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.113
- I'm sure it kills him to be around you.
- Shut up.

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.457
- Oh, my God.
- What? It's not that surprising.

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:29.430
No. It's... Over there.
It's Crazy Christie.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:30.725
- Tommy's ex?
- Yeah.

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.232
Which one is she?

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.563
She's the little Audrey Hepburn
in the red dress.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.466
- That's her, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:37.165
She's not that pretty.

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:38.466
You need to talk to her.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.872
I don't want to make a scene.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:42.843
Make a huge fucking scene.
This has gone on long enough.

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:48.611
You're right.
This has gone on long enough.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.459
Can I help you?

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:04.827
We've never met before, but I...

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.069
You used to date Tom Fielding, right?

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:12.269
Are you one of Tommy's ex-girlfriends?

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.876
Ex-girlfriends? No.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:18.243
Tommy and I have been together
for three months now.

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:30.124
Nice necklace.

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.686
Sorry.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:04.055
I ran into an old friend
on line for the bathroom.

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:06.993
It's okay.
Should we get the check?

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:10.293
Actually, I think I
want to stay out tonight.

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:13.563
I mean, we spent the whole day inside.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.934
Yeah, but wasn't it great?

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:19.441
Well, all we ever do
is stay in and have sex...

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.135
since the first night we met.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.436
I want to go out tonight.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:29.016
But we are out.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:32.988
<i>Ciao, carissima.</i>

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.990
<i>Ciao, Paolo.</i>

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.616
Tommy...

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.754
Paolo, this is Tommy.

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.922
- Ah, Tommy.
- Paolo.

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.932
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.991
Oh, Paolo, Tommy
speaks Italian too.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.268
Yeah, it's a little loud in here

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.473
and I'm a little rusty, probably, so...

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.850
We speak English then, hmm?

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.283
Yeah. It's probably better for everyone.

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.746
Sure.

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:10.490
So, how do you guys
know each other?

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.493
Oh, I... Okay.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.863
So, one day, Brooke came into my studio

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.661
to make some photos.

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.531
Very nice photos, eh?

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.536
- Paolo is a genius.
- Oh, no.

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:23.866
- Yes.
- So,

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:26.703
Tommy, what is it you do?

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:29.243
I work at a bank...
Morgan Brothers.

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.905
- Sales trading.
- I understand. Wall Street.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.505
I get it. Money, huh? Money?

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:37.108
Paolo, when did you get to New York,
and why didn't you call me?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:40.053
I'm only here one week.
I mean, tomorrow I have show opening,

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:43.114
tonight we're out to celebrate, I did...

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:46.593
You must join us.
To celebrate. Tonight.

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:49.563
Oh, come on. Huh?

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:52.191
Well, you wouldn't mind
if I went with them, would you?

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:57.732
I mean, you wanted to
go home anyway, right?

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.772
Euro-trash piece of fucking shit.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:06.007
If that's what you want to go home with.

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.982
I mean, fuck!

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:11.744
Sorry about that.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.082
Have a good evening.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.239
Hey, Samantha, it's Thomas.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.904
It's about 11:00 Saturday night.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.312
I would love to see you,
so give me a call back.

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.644
All right.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.879
Amy. Tom.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:51.153
Hey. Saturday night, about 10.

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.426
I'd love to see you.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.467
Jen.

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:02.561
It's your favourite co-worker, Tommy.

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.071
I'd love to see you,

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:06.573
even if it's late.

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:08.166
So call me back.

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.073
Fuck.

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:29.091
You should hear some of the things
he says about you.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.296
I think I have an idea.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.600
I spent so much time hating you.

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:41.404
I don't know what to believe.

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.008
Hey, Beth.
How's girls' night out going?

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:18.706
Tommy, I don't want to see you again.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.838
Ever.

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.405
Whoa... Wait, Beth.

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:23.747
What are you talking about?
That's... Where are you?

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.720
I know about Christie, Tommy.

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.415
- Everything.
- No, what are you...

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.219
Beth, this is crazy.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:33.728
No, it's not, actually.

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.023
Well, not anymore.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.758
Who have you been talking to?

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:39.767
Beth. Beth!

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.696
Fuck.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.842
Hey, you know what, buddy?

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:53.404
Change of plans.
We're going to be staying downtown.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.608
Coming.

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.184
Hey.

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:05.181
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.852
What's going on, man?

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.021
You, uh...

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:12.262
You haven't spoken to Beth tonight

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.734
by any chance, have you?

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:16.998
Well, yeah, but I didn't
think it was a big deal.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.973
Well, it is a big deal, Daniel.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.373
It's a big fucking deal.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.877
- Why? - 'Cause you told her
I was fucking Christie.

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.607
I don't even know what...

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:29.173
You want to fuck my girl,
don't you, you little fucking cunt?

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.582
I didn't say anything.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.279
You didn't say anything?
Why would you call her, huh?

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.720
- Huh?
- She called me.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.917
We talked for two minutes
about a book we were reading.

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:39.358
That's it.

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:50.760
Book club.

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.363
Yeah.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.567
Oh, now I understand.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.633
You can understand
why I misinterpreted...

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.611
Actually, I can't, Tommy.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:00.443
Hurt me as much as it did you.

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:02.040
I'm sure we'll be laughing
about it on Monday.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.948
Look, I'll take you out to lunch, okay?

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.283
- Yeah.
- All right, all right.

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:10.587
Look, you think it over,
you get that fixed up.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.251
Monday we'll straighten
this whole thing out.

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:13.817
I don't think so, Tommy.

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.699
Daniel, come on, don't...

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:19.825
Go home, Tommy.

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.703
Just go home.

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.007
Sounds good. Okay. Okay.

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.272
84th and 5th.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.523
$8.20, please.

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:31.371
I think I lost my wallet.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.930
$8.20, sir.

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.066
I think I lost my wallet, sir.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.702
We can go ATM.

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:39.644
No, my cards are in my wallet.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.182
But, you know,
I'll tell you what.

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:43.547
I have money upstairs.
If you just wait here for a couple minutes,

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.813
I'll run up, I'll grab it,
I'll bring it down for you.

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:47.582
Get the fuck out of my taxi.

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.442
- Hey, Beth.
- Hey.

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:16.382
Sorry. Um, do you
still have company?

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:19.079
No. No, not at all.
Are you okay?

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.246
Can I ask a favour?

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:25.148
You can say no, but, um...

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:26.626
please don't say no, okay?

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:29.323
Beth, Beth, I'll be right there.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:51.644
It's been a while, Tommy.

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.649
Evening, Miss Perkins.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.323
Your place looks nice.

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.891
Did you miss me?

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:49.237
What did you do now?

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:01.419
Hi, Christie, it's Mom.

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.184
Call me when you get a chance.

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:06.694
Hey, it's Tommy.

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:08.854
I'm just going to crash
at my place tonight, okay?

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:11.398
- You fucking asshole.
- Love you.

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:12.558
Fuck.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.373
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.776
- What?
- Yeah.

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:26.404
What happened?

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.278
I guess Tommy's
having a rough night.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.374
Tommy did that?

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.782
Why would he...

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.843
I guess he thought that I...

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:35.515
- That I told you about Christie.
- How would you even...

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:42.794
- Wow. Is everybody fucking left-handed?
- You knew?

01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:45.958
- The whole time?
- No. Not the whole time.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:47.023
Why didn't you tell me?

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:49.696
- I should have.
- No.

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:52.672
You have your job to think about,

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.299
and your friends.

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.844
Beth, I quit my job.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.109
Those aren't my friends.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.740
It's just you.

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:13.225
Baby, you're a little light here.

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.695
I know. I'll make it up to you.

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.629
I'm sorry, baby, but you know
it doesn't work that way.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.999
Look, I lost my wallet tonight.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.469
And I will make it up to you.

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.665
- I promise.
- Listen, motherfucker.

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.970
You will get me
my motherfucking money

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.738
or I'm going to fucking scream
until the fucking cops come.

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:32.575
And that would fuck you a lot more
than it would fuck me.

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:33.909
Okay, how about we just calm down.

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:36.610
And I'll find a way to get
your money for you, okay?

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:40.382
Just give me a minute
to think about it.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.390
Okay, baby.
Whenever you're ready.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:52.393
- Irv, how's it going?
- You can't go up there, son.

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:54.662
I just need to talk
to Christie for a second.

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.670
You're no longer on the guest list.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:01.601
Irv, look, my man,
I'm up there all the time.

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:04.440
Donny, show this man to the door.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.343
I feel sorry for you, Tommy.

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.137
I do.

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.082
Thanks, baby.

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:26.156
Two stops, please.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:40.202
So, that's how we got here.

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:43.505
It's not pretty.

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.603
I know.

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:51.452
I really don't have anything left
to say for myself.

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.982
Maybe that's a start.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.121
So, what are you going to do now?

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.057
I don't know.

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.321
Chris Baker,

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.595
he keeps asking me to join
him at his new place,

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:12.732
but I'm just not sure that's
what I want to do right now.

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:18.410
Have you ever been up
in a hot air balloon?

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:20.805
What?

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.382
Never mind.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.747
Tommy.

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.224
<i>Buon giorno, carissima.</i>

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:24.408
Why did you come back
in that restaurant for my number?

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.046
I just couldn't be with that other girl

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.742
when all I wanted was to talk to you.

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.921
Whatever happened to her, anyway?

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.266
Just wasn't right.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.966
When you flipped that coin,

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.204
and I said I wanted to stay,

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:58.438
I don't think I realized it then,

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:02.482
but I was thinking
about you when I said it.

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:03.916
I know.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.049
So, what was it?

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:11.557
What was what?

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:12.752
Heads or tails?

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:15.653
Stay or leave?

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.769
That's what I thought.
