Being on the radio is fun.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.578
Just like talking
on the telephone.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.656
One time when I was
in high school, the teacher...

01:30.791 --> 01:32.589
HOWARD:
Just relax.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.160
GEORGE: Five... four... three...
two... one, we're on the air!

01:34.294 --> 01:36.786
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Milwaukee.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.591
This is George Fenneman,
your roving reporter,

01:38.732 --> 01:40.359
and right now
we are broadcasting live

01:40.500 --> 01:42.969
from the home
of Howard and Marion Cunningham.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.730
Welcome to our lovely home.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.805
Would you like to see upstairs?

01:48.241 --> 01:50.869
Marion, this is not
"Person to Person".

01:51.011 --> 01:52.604
Then why did I wear the fez?

01:52.746 --> 01:55.738
Howard Cunningham
and Al Delveccio

01:55.882 --> 01:58.317
are co-chairmen
of the Leopard Lodge's

01:58.452 --> 02:01.683
annual Sunnyside Orphanage
Fundraising Dinner Show

02:01.822 --> 02:03.916
being held tomorrow night
at the Pfister Hotel.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.718
Um, Mr. Cunningham,

02:05.859 --> 02:07.987
uh, could you tell us
about the upcoming events?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.721
No, that's-that's Delveccio.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.388
Oh, all right, Mr. Delveccio,

02:11.531 --> 02:13.363
could you tell us
about the event?

02:14.701 --> 02:18.467
M-M-Mr. Delveccio?

02:18.605 --> 02:21.597
Well, it seems the cat's got
Mr. Delveccio's tongue.

02:21.742 --> 02:25.235
Um, Mr. Howard, would you, uh--
you are Howard?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.347
- Yes. -Would you...
You are co-chairman?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.539
- Yes.
- Would you like to tell us?

02:28.682 --> 02:29.649
Yes, I'm co-chairman.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.512
Delveccio handles entertainment.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.983
- I handle magic.
- Oh.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.383
Well, uh, all right.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.547
It's gonna be
a very exciting evening, George.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.159
We're gonna start off

02:39.292 --> 02:40.589
with a-a sumptuous dinner,

02:40.727 --> 02:42.923
and then we're gonna have
a spectacular magic show

02:43.063 --> 02:45.657
featuring
the Incredible Crostini,

02:45.799 --> 02:48.166
and-and he's going
to attempt to do

02:48.301 --> 02:50.827
a-a terrific,
terrific suspenseful trick.

02:50.971 --> 02:54.271
It's the famous milk can escape.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.809
Yeah, and-and here to extend
a special invitation

02:56.943 --> 03:00.004
to our audience are Louie
and Louise,

03:00.147 --> 03:02.878
our little poster children
from the orphanage.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.506
I like magic, and I'd love you

03:04.651 --> 03:05.982
to come watch the show with me.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.746
Me, too. Magic's neat.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.855
I'm Louie.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.115
Aren't they darling?

03:10.257 --> 03:11.190
Oh, they're just charming.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.759
Louie and Louise. Um...

03:13.894 --> 03:15.453
It's going to be
a fun-filled evening, folks.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.427
Uh, that's Mr. Delveccio,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.793
Rosa Colletti,

03:18.932 --> 03:20.422
if you're out there, listen.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.659
All is forgiven.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.860
- Al!
- This is Al.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.129
I'm talking...

03:24.271 --> 03:27.798
Good morning, everybody.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.636
More company!

03:29.776 --> 03:30.709
Isn't this nice?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.903
This is our friend
Arthur Fonzarelli.

03:33.046 --> 03:33.979
How nice.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.878
Hey out there in Radio Land.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.177
Arthur Fonzarelli here.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.480
Listen, benefit,
Saturday night, $15,

03:40.620 --> 03:43.385
Cheap.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.548
Be there. Whoa.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.525
I sounded pretty good, huh?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.528
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:50.664 --> 03:52.598
maybe we better go back
to-to Howard Cunningham.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.329
There's more?

03:56.636 --> 03:59.003
Joanie, look at this.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.733
We've been replaced.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.070

04:03.210 --> 04:04.575
Oh, we're still on the air.

The Great Crostini is

04:54.494 --> 04:55.518
He was injured.

04:55.662 --> 04:56.720
He had an accident doing

04:56.863 --> 04:58.854
his milk can escape,
and he almost drowned.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.057
Drowned!

05:00.200 --> 05:02.601
Well, that's not
in our contract!

05:02.736 --> 05:05.603
Dear, I'm sure
it wasn't intentional.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.367
Yeah, but he's the only one
who can do the milk can escape.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.873
Oh, now I'm ruined.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.035
And the Leopard Lodge
is gonna blame me for this,

05:12.179 --> 05:14.511
and they're gonna demote me
to fez checker again.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.083
Hey, hey, hey, no problem,

05:17.217 --> 05:19.208
no fez checker for you, either.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.719
Well, Fonz, it sounds
sort of like a problem.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.552
Oh, now, we're gonna
have to cancel the dinner.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.886
No cancelling nothing.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.187
You're forgetting
the kids, right?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.817
Hey, kids, what's that loot

05:28.962 --> 05:30.020
gonna be used for?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.824
Well, we got a leaky roof.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.558
- Yeah. -And everyone
was gonna get new beds.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.861
Yeah.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.265
And our Alvin and the Chipmunk
record wore out.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.236
Alvin and the Chipmunk record.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.396
Now that is the topper.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.632
Yeah, the show must go on.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.265
The show must go on.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.275
But how?

05:44.411 --> 05:45.901
Our star is in the hospital.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.208
Hey, the Amazing Randi.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.474
That's great!

05:49.616 --> 05:52.586

05:52.719 --> 05:54.813

06:03.530 --> 06:04.861
He knows the escape artist

06:04.998 --> 06:07.626

06:07.767 --> 06:09.292
Is he any good?

06:10.670 --> 06:11.694
What about the milk can escape?

06:11.838 --> 06:13.670
Milk can is his middle name.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.208
Well, all right. I'll make a few
calls, and we'll look into it.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.573
No, you better get him now.
He's hot, gone.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.043
All right,
we-we'll sign him up right away.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.147
I'll call him.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.715
Richard, make him sign
this contract.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.214

06:24.351 --> 06:26.786
I'm gonna get Ralph and Potsie.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.046
We're gonna go to Chicago,

06:28.188 --> 06:31.055
and we're gonna meet this man
face to face.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.592

an Andy Hardy movie.

He's not here.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.502
<i>Let's PW!-</i>

07:17.637 --> 07:19.662

at all this stuff, guys.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.638
Hey, a magic hat!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.334
Oh, Potsie,
don't touch that stuff, okay?

07:23.476 --> 07:25.274
Come on, Pots, let's see you
pull a rabbit out of it.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.403
I can't; it's empty.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.605
I thought it was empty.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.273
What the heck? How do we...

07:30.417 --> 07:31.942
You got to put that back.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.143
All taken care of.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.687
Hey, I wonder what he does
with this thing.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.483
- I saw this once.
- Oh, yeah?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.058
Yeah, I was buying
a rubber nose.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.557
Yeah, sure.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.753
All it did,
it collapses and disappears.

07:42.896 --> 07:43.988
Watch. Oh!

07:44.130 --> 07:47.293
Just what the room needed,
a little color.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.924
You guys are making me nervous.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.764
Ah, come on, Rich.
This place is like a fun house.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.167
- Well, yeah, but...
- Look at this.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.568
I bet it makes you disappear.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.697
- Hey, get in.
- All right.

07:54.841 --> 07:55.899
(chuckles)

07:56.042 --> 07:57.100
Am I still here?

07:57.243 --> 07:58.142
- No, it didn't work.
- Oh.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.404
Okay, I'm gonna lock you up.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.105
No, I'm not sure
you should do that, Pots.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.681
Let's give it a try.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.749
Come on, get over here, Rich.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.180
Well, uh, it says push here.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.183
Well, then push.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.377
Well, all right.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.284
Here we go, Malph.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.288

08:11.424 --> 08:12.755

08:12.892 --> 08:14.223
Oh, come on, guys.
You broke me.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.556
Somebody fix this.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.787
I haven't got the stomach
for it.

08:16.930 --> 08:17.954
(laughter)

08:18.098 --> 08:19.190
I've still got it.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.061
- Even in three pieces, huh?
- You do.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.726
- Now let's get you out of there.
- All right.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.132
Watch your hand there.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.328
All right.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.462
Hurry up. Get him out.

08:26.606 --> 08:27.801
Hurry UP-

08:27.941 --> 08:29.204
Wait till the Amazing Randi
gets here.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.707
-(g roans)
- All right.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.174
Oh, welcome back, hips.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.575
Hey, guys, guys, look.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.647
Oh, Pots!

08:35.782 --> 08:36.840
Look.

08:36.982 --> 08:37.950
The Amazing Randi comes in here

08:38.083 --> 08:39.176
and sees us playing around
with his stuff,

08:39.318 --> 08:40.480
he's not gonna
sign the contract.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.951
- Eh.
- Get rid of this stuff.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.283
- How?
- Well, I don't know.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.481
Let's throw it out the window
or something.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.648
- Just until he signs.
- All right, all right,

08:45.792 --> 08:47.226
- I'll get the curtains.
- It keeps coming.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.452
Well, help me with it, Ralph.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.960
What do you think I'm doing?

08:50.096 --> 08:51.894
-(gasping)
'oh!

08:52.032 --> 08:53.056
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.826
I'm the Amazing Randi.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.096
Oh, yeah?
Got any identification?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.103
- Potsie!
- Uh...

08:59.239 --> 09:01.367
Hello, Mr. Amazing.
I'm, uh, I'm Richie Cunningham.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.704
I... This is, this is something.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.608
Uh, sir,
why are you hanging upside down

09:06.746 --> 09:10.011
in a strait jacket 14 stories
over Michigan Avenue?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.209
- It's 2:00.
- Ah.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.842
You see, I do this for practice.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.751
It keeps me in shape.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.516
Oh, well, uh, see,

09:17.657 --> 09:20.285
I'm the guy that Arthur
Fonzarelli spoke to you about.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.054
Oh, yes. You're the young man
with the orphans.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.596
Uh, I'd be very happy
to do that benefit for you.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.256
Hey, that's great!
Well, uh, listen,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.197
I've got a contract, but I guess
you can't sign it now

09:28.334 --> 09:29.301
so I'll leave it on the desk.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.631
Oh, no need, no need.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.866
I have a pen right here.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.999
Well, all right.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.406
Uh, sign right there.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.707
That's amazing!

09:40.847 --> 09:42.781
He's got a pen
that writes upside down.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.442
Well, thanks a lot, Mr. Amazing.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.848
- Okay.
- Yeah, see you.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.681
Yeah. Hang in there.

Al, we're doing great, huh?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.163
Yeah, terrific.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.704
- It's terrible.
- Huh?

10:40.840 --> 10:42.239
Rich, help me.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.638
Everything's going wrong.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.505
- Oh, it's gonna be fine, Al.
- Oh, sure. Fine.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.773
You know, I put in an order for
coffee and drinks for everyone.

10:47.914 --> 10:48.972
Well, where are they?

10:49.115 --> 10:50.674
- Isn't that it on the tray?
- Where?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.216
Well, all right,
they snuck it in.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.013
Okay, what's next
on the clipboard?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.747
All right, all right, uh, Dad
has a few announcements to make.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.015
He's got a few announcements
to make.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.318
And then he's gonna introduce
the magician.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.153
Okay, all right,
where's your Dad? Where is he?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.852
You know, he's co-chairman too,
you know.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.656
He's on stage making
a few announcements.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.025
Good.
That's where he should be.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.929
All right,
now where's the magician?

11:07.066 --> 11:08.261
Where is the magician?

11:08.401 --> 11:09.664
- Right there, Al.
- Here-here-here's the magician.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.327
All right, all right,
you all ready to go on?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.870
- Okay? Good.
- Yeah, of course, I'm ready.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.838
Uh, Joanie.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.443
I'm not going on
in front of all those people.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.046
I look like a bike reflector.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.375
Joanie, the audience
is filled with hunks.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.504
(chuckles)

11:22.649 --> 11:24.879
Ready when you are, A.R.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.543
All right, all right.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.745
Look, I got to go fix up
all your props for you.

11:28.888 --> 11:32.518
Okay now.
Joanie, you look cute.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.354
All right, Mr. Amazing,
place is packed.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.758
At $15 a head,
go out there and kill them.

11:36.896 --> 11:37.886
Yeah.

11:38.031 --> 11:38.998
I'm ready.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.896
(coughing)

11:41.034 --> 11:42.365
- I'll get some water.
- Oh, good.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.129
Nerves.
Happens every performance.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.863
That's all right. Potsie's
getting you some water there.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.439
- Here we go.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.633
Sure.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.279
(gasping)

11:53.413 --> 11:55.279
N-Not water.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.907
Huh?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.917
This is straight vodka!

12:00.053 --> 12:01.111
What?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.187
That's impossible.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.448
I don't drink.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.648
Rich! Rich!

12:04.791 --> 12:06.122
Mr. Amazing!

12:06.259 --> 12:07.556
All right, fellas.

12:07.694 --> 12:08.684
We're running late.

12:08.828 --> 12:09.852
I mean, your dad is out there

12:09.996 --> 12:11.293
telling a bunch of corny jokes.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.024
Now, who's next on the schedule?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.429
(groaning)

12:14.567 --> 12:16.729
How...

12:16.869 --> 12:18.803
dry---...

12:18.938 --> 12:21.999
lam...

12:22.141 --> 12:24.109
He sings, too?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.111
A kangaroo goes into a bar
and asks for a scotch and soda.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.443
And the bartender says,
"That'll be $7.50."

12:29.582 --> 12:32.210
And the bartender says,

12:32.352 --> 12:34.514
"You know, we don't get
too many kangaroos in here."

12:34.654 --> 12:37.589
- Howard!
- And he...

12:37.724 --> 12:39.658
Marion, I'm right
in the middle of a joke.

12:39.792 --> 12:40.987
Oh, everybody knows
that joke, Howard.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.060
Oh?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.253
And then the kangaroo says,

12:43.396 --> 12:45.455
"Well, at these prices,
it's no wonder."

12:47.066 --> 12:49.125
What do you want, Marion?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.260
Huh?

12:53.139 --> 12:55.506
(laughs)

12:55.642 --> 12:56.632
Uh, uh, look, folks,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.175
why don't you just take
a few minutes

12:58.311 --> 13:00.678
and finish your tapioca pudding,
and I'll be right back.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.672
What's happening here?

13:03.816 --> 13:06.786
Well, uh, the, uh,
Amazing Randi,

13:06.919 --> 13:08.045
uh, thirsty, and nervous,

13:08.187 --> 13:11.054
and so Potsie, not water, vodka.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.625
Blotto.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.524
You gave him a glass of vodka?

13:15.662 --> 13:16.925
Yeah. (screams)

13:17.063 --> 13:18.531
Dad, you can't do it!

13:18.665 --> 13:19.996
- Why not?
- There's no time.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.897
Right. There's no time.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.298
If he can't perform,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.268
they're going to start screaming
for their money back.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.032
All right, Dad, now listen,
we can't panic.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.073
It's true,
we're in quite a bit of trouble.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.303
But we just got to,
just got to try to sober him up.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.469
Okay, so could you stall?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.342
And how do you propose
I stall, huh?

13:35.481 --> 13:36.573
Two giraffes meet
on the street...

13:36.716 --> 13:37.979
♪ Venus, goddess of love
that you are... ♪

13:38.117 --> 13:40.313
That's not a stall,
that's a dead stop.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.852
You could tell your war stories.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.012
They take forever, Dad.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.090
Yeah, I could do that.

13:45.224 --> 13:46.953
- Mr. C...
- Oh, no, Howard.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.452
Well, all right, all right.

13:49.595 --> 13:50.960
Let's try and get him up
and walk him around.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.121
Mom, would you get
some coffee, please?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.199
All right, certainly.
Uh, cream and sugar?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.358
Black, Mom, black.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.525
Let's go.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.159
Okay. How you doing?

13:58.304 --> 14:01.001
I just came in to wish Randi,
uh...

14:01.140 --> 14:02.471
Oh, it's amazing.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.967
I'm all dressed up
and nowhere to disappear.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.273
Well, you're young, dear.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.744
You'll get used
to the disappointment.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.349
All right,
don't fret, everybody.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.645
All you got to do
is find another magician.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.844
Fonz, where are we gonna
find another magician?

14:14.987 --> 14:16.045
Oh.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.486
Well, here ya got a red scarf,

14:17.623 --> 14:19.819
see, like, like that?

14:19.959 --> 14:22.223
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.854
That's wonderful.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.021
Wonderful.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.690
Isn't that wonderful?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.063
You thought that was wonderful?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.102
.L.ley_
"Oh!

14:47.220 --> 14:49.314
Here is what you have been
waiting for.

14:49.455 --> 14:52.186
A man whose actions speak louder
than words,

14:52.325 --> 14:54.987
the Fantastic Fonzie.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.119
(drum rolling)

15:02.001 --> 15:03.969
All right, you lucky devils.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.593
I need my able assistant,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.298
my most beautiful shortcake.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.681
The bowl, madam.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.376
All right, now,
I'll tell you something.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.921
She loves me.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.547
She loves me not.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.682
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.818
she loves me.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.056
And because I love her,

15:32.198 --> 15:35.964
I need her to have
a whole bouquet herself.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.001
You know...

15:37.136 --> 15:38.763
Where are they?

15:38.905 --> 15:39.963
There they are!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.074
(applause)

15:46.779 --> 15:48.941
Coming up is a doozy.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.072
It's gonna put a snap
in your trunks.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.516
The disappearing box.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.952
May I have my assistants,
please?

15:57.089 --> 16:00.525
I'm gonna get in this box here.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.358
You'll notice that everything's
the same right here.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.862
I'm going to disappear.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.056
Whoa.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.759
Spin me!

16:08.901 --> 16:10.027
RICHIE:
All right, here we go.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.806
Two ostriches meet
on the street...

16:14.941 --> 16:16.932
No humor, Ralph, this is magic.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.885
You brought me back
a little soon.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.325
All right, this next trick,

16:34.460 --> 16:37.293
this next trick is fabulous.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.795
It's called the floating woman.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.126
I need a volunteer.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.563
Pick me, pick me!

16:41.701 --> 16:43.430
I think I got a live wire.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.901
A loud round of applause
for Mrs. C.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.530
Don't overdo it, Marion!

16:48.674 --> 16:49.732
(applause)

16:53.145 --> 16:55.443
All right, now, Mrs. C.,
listen up.

16:55.581 --> 16:56.742
When I snap my fingers,

16:56.883 --> 16:59.944
you're gonna go
into a deep sleep.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.485
I'm ready when you are, Arthur.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.282
-(snaps) -All right,
my assistants please.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.948
Not now, Mrs. C.

17:09.395 --> 17:12.762
All right,
I want you to concentrate.

17:12.898 --> 17:14.388
Watch my fingers.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.730
Watch them, watch them,

17:16.868 --> 17:18.428
-(snaps)
-and you're out like a light.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.741
All right, gentlemen.

17:37.089 --> 17:40.150
Gentlemen, the chairs.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.332
Gentlemen, the board.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.660
(applause)

17:56.242 --> 17:58.643
My Hula-Hoop.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.007
Shortcake.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.137
Thank you.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.858
(applause)

18:18.230 --> 18:19.925
HECKLER:
We want danger!

18:20.066 --> 18:21.465
Give us the milk can escape.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.094
Please, please, can't you see
I'm in a trance here?

18:25.237 --> 18:26.500
(snaps)

18:29.008 --> 18:30.442
Hasn't he sobered up yet?

18:30.576 --> 18:32.840
I did every trick I know
in the book and I also did...

18:32.979 --> 18:34.640
I promised
them the milk can escape.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.714
He's not sober yet, Fonz,
and we have tried everything.

18:36.849 --> 18:37.975
They're just not gonna leave

18:38.117 --> 18:39.642
until they see
the milk can escape.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.877
Well, I'm afraid
we're just gonna

18:41.020 --> 18:42.112
have to give them
their money back.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.653
Oh, Mr. C...

18:43.789 --> 18:45.621
Hi, show's going great.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.159
Oh, yes it is, but, uh,

18:48.294 --> 18:50.228
well, I'm afraid
the Amazing Randi

18:50.363 --> 18:51.626
isn't feeling so well.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.289
(groans)

18:53.432 --> 18:55.161
And no one else can do
the milk can escape,

18:55.301 --> 18:56.962
you see,
because it's very dangerous.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.195
What about Fonzie?

18:58.337 --> 18:59.668
He can do anything.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.705
Yeah, that's-that's true,
that's very true,

19:01.841 --> 19:03.366
but in this particular case,

19:03.509 --> 19:06.137
uh, you know, people drown.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.178
Please, Fonz,
you've got to do it.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.975
No, uh, kids,
I don't think you understand.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.675
There are only three people
in the whole world

19:11.817 --> 19:13.717
that can do this, uh,
escape trick, you know?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.150
One of them is dead,

19:15.287 --> 19:17.517
one of them is in the hospital
and one of them is, uh...

19:17.657 --> 19:18.818
(groaning)

19:18.958 --> 19:21.359
Smashed out of his gourd.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.292
Correctamundo.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.329
The orphanage needs the money.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.488
Please, Fonz?

19:26.632 --> 19:28.464
You can do it.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.194
Fonzie, you can't do it.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.327
Arthur, this is too dangerous.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.873
The milk can escape can only
be done by a trained magician.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.476
Or you, Fonz.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.975
You can do it, Fonz.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.102
- Please?
- Would you?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.548
All right, look,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.584
just prepare the milk can,
you know.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.914
BOTH:
Yay!

19:48.054 --> 19:50.022
Hey, hey, look, Mr. C.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.317
I mean, you only live once.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.518
I mean, it's just a trick,
ain't it?

19:54.660 --> 19:56.128
Mm-hmm.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.821
But do you know how to do it?

19:57.963 --> 19:59.692
I was hoping you could tell me.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.391
(groaning)

20:01.534 --> 20:03.024
BOTH:
He can't.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.637
No.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.602
AUDIENCE:
We want the milk can!

20:06.739 --> 20:08.639
We want the milk can!

20:08.774 --> 20:12.108
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?

20:12.244 --> 20:14.542
You are about to witness

20:14.680 --> 20:16.444
one of the most unusual,

20:16.582 --> 20:18.175
the most breathtaking

20:18.317 --> 20:20.945
and dangerous deeds
ever attempted.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.715
The famous milk can escape.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.847
(applause)

20:30.563 --> 20:32.327
HECKLER:
Well, it's about time.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.491
There gentlemen are preparing
the milk can.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.228
Boy, I'd hate to be the cow
that had to fill this.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.600
HECKLER:
Put him in it!

20:40.740 --> 20:43.710
Hurry up, Pots,
they're getting hostile.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.005
Okay, that does it!

20:47.012 --> 20:49.037
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

20:49.181 --> 20:52.344
the man who will be performing
this extraordinary feat

20:52.485 --> 20:54.453
of derring do, the one,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.919
the only, king of escape,

20:57.056 --> 21:00.890
the Fantastic Fonzie!

21:01.026 --> 21:03.017
(applause)

21:13.105 --> 21:15.904
Fonzie, it's not too late
to change your mind, you know.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.805
Hey, I know what I'm doing,
Mr. C.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.206
I know.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.110
And I want to tell you all
that this can is solid steel.

21:22.248 --> 21:26.014
It is the exact can
that Houdini used

21:26.152 --> 21:28.746
that I'm gonna use.

21:38.063 --> 21:40.725
Whoa.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.857
Uh-oh.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.870
Get the locks!

21:53.012 --> 21:54.241
- Get it down.
- Are they down?

21:54.380 --> 21:55.870
I got this one.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.141
And this one's a little stuck.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.775
All right, locked back here.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.216
- Okay.
- Okay, bring in the curtain.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.185
- Curtain down.
- Bring curtain down.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.086
15 seconds!

22:05.224 --> 22:07.022
Incidentally,
ladies and gentlemen,

22:07.159 --> 22:09.287
the locks used here
were supplied and certified

22:09.428 --> 22:11.897
to be authentic
by Cunningham Hardware.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.556
RALPH:
25 seconds!

22:13.699 --> 22:15.189
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are privileged

22:15.334 --> 22:17.598
to be the only audience
in the history

22:17.736 --> 22:18.965
of the state of Wisconsin

22:19.104 --> 22:22.369
to see Houdini's magic
milk can escape.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.636
This is something you're going
to be able to tell

22:24.777 --> 22:26.575
-your grandchildren.
-35 seconds.

22:26.712 --> 22:27.907
What's happening?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.310
Fonzie's doing
the milk can escape.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.609
RALPH: He's been in there
over 40 seconds!

22:30.749 --> 22:31.682
MARION:
Oh, Howard.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.012
40 seconds!
Get him out of there.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.018
- He'll drown!
-(screaming)

22:35.154 --> 22:36.246
Who's got the keys?

22:36.388 --> 22:37.583
Ralph's got them.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.714
(screaming continues)

22:41.493 --> 22:42.927
I've got the ax.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.823
(applause)

23:13.425 --> 23:15.052
Hey, gang, George Fenneman said

23:15.194 --> 23:16.628
he's gonna review
our show tonight.

23:16.762 --> 23:17.854
Just a few minutes.

23:17.997 --> 23:18.862
Hey.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.090
I got great news.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.722
It looks like we're gonna clear
over $12,000.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.130
All right.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.135
What a fabamundo night.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.670
I'll bet I could get
a lot of hunks

23:26.805 --> 23:28.466
with that milk can escape trick.

23:28.607 --> 23:29.768
I think I'll try it.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.809
Hunks? Hunks?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.036
What are you, crazy?

23:33.178 --> 23:34.703
Hey, let me tell you something,
shortcake.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.144
I've been in that can, you know?

23:36.282 --> 23:38.751
I mean, you could die
in there or worse!

23:40.753 --> 23:42.812
Oh, Amazing,
how are you feeling?

23:42.955 --> 23:45.049
My first hangover.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.248
Thanks to Potsie.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.382
You're welcome.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.551
Oh, that music
is driving me nuts.

23:49.695 --> 23:50.992
You mind if I get rid of it?

23:51.130 --> 23:52.564
No, wait a minute.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.996
I brought it down so we could
hear George Fenneman's review.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.465
- Oh, Al.
- Come on.

23:56.602 --> 24:00.004
He told me he was gonna mention
my name on the radio.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.130
Look, if Rosa Colletti
is listening, she'll hear me.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.641
What should I do
with this thing now?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.643
- Oh, well.
-(music stops, gasps)

24:06.779 --> 24:08.770
oh!

24:13.118 --> 24:15.485
That's really amazing.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.884
Sure. Sure, it's not your radio.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.184
Oh, Al, I'm sorry.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.017
- Fonzie.
- Yeah.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.185
Thanks a lot.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.296
You really saved the day.
