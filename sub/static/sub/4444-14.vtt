- But I'm not getting adopted.

00:04.910 --> 00:07.795
I have to think about this. I have to...

00:07.830 --> 00:10.798
Is it because of Lou? Is
Lou why you can't be with me?

00:10.833 --> 00:13.400
No, you're the reason why
I can't be with you, Callie.

00:13.552 --> 00:15.719

- Because you're camping.

OK, troops, we're leaving in ten
minutes! Let's go! Chop-chop-chop!

02:05.280 --> 02:07.614
Hey. So, I was thinking, what if we
make the kids leave their phones at home?

02:07.666 --> 02:10.699
- Do you want a mutiny?
- No, I want them to actually experience

02:10.752 --> 02:14.537
something without tweeting
or twerking about it.

02:14.589 --> 02:17.340
Twerking? Do you know what twerking is?

02:17.375 --> 02:19.759
Yeah, some kind of social media thing.

02:19.795 --> 02:21.678
This is twerking.

02:25.517 --> 02:29.519
Really? I like that. Do that more often.

02:29.554 --> 02:33.440
Honey, I know you want this weekend
to be a big bonding experience,

02:33.475 --> 02:35.642
- but the kids are addicted to their phones.
- Fine. Great.

02:35.644 --> 02:38.561
Then we'll take the TV with us
and video games. It'll be awesome.

02:38.613 --> 02:40.530
Or we can just let them
wean themselves off.

02:40.565 --> 02:43.733
And once we get out into nature,
with hopefully very bad reception,

02:43.785 --> 02:45.735
- I bet you they'll put them down.
- Oh, yeah?

02:45.787 --> 02:47.704
Well, I will take that
bet. And when they don't,

02:47.789 --> 02:49.456
I don't want it to fall
on me to crack the whip.

02:49.491 --> 02:52.459
- You can't be "nice mom" all the time.
- I'm not "nice mom."

02:52.494 --> 02:55.745
Yes, you are. Why do you think
they always confide in you?

02:55.797 --> 02:58.331
They don't. They... they come to you.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.300
Yeah, when they want a push.

03:00.335 --> 03:03.303
When they want a hug, they choose you.

13:04.236 --> 13:07.320
I have to talk to Mike. I have to find
out if he's the father of Ana's baby...

13:07.373 --> 13:09.322
Right this minute?

13:09.358 --> 13:10.540
And what if he is, what're
you gonna do about it?

13:10.576 --> 13:12.492
- I can't sit here and wait?
- Sit here and wait?

13:12.544 --> 13:15.579
Yes. Yes, you can. We
are out here together,

13:15.631 --> 13:18.548
as a family, to connect.
Off the grid, remember?

13:18.584 --> 13:20.467
Does that look off the grid to you?

13:26.278 --> 13:30.523
_

13:30.532 --> 13:31.511
[Jesus] Dude, I need your help.

13:31.513 --> 13:33.380
Hayley's here.

13:33.415 --> 13:35.399
What, "here" here?

13:35.434 --> 13:38.351
At another campsite. She just showed up.

13:38.404 --> 13:42.272
- Wow. That's a bold move.
- What should I do?

13:42.324 --> 13:45.358
Well, tell her to go home, I
mean, before you get in trouble.

13:45.394 --> 13:47.327
- Really? I can say that?
- Yeah.

13:47.362 --> 13:49.663
I mean, you didn't invite
her, right? Just text her back.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.581
All right, everybody,
hand over your phones.

13:51.617 --> 13:53.333
- What?
- Mom!

13:53.368 --> 13:54.618
- Now! Let's go!
- Let me finish.

13:54.670 --> 13:56.286
- No. Come on.
- I'm gonna...

13:56.338 --> 13:57.370
- No, no!
- Let me finish..

13:57.423 --> 13:58.422
No more tweeting,

13:58.457 --> 13:59.423
no more liking,

13:59.458 --> 14:00.373
no more posting.

14:00.426 --> 14:02.542
We are going off the grid.

14:02.544 --> 14:04.511
Well, what are we supposed to do now?

14:04.546 --> 14:06.346
And don't say "enjoy nature."

14:06.381 --> 14:08.548
What are we supposed to do now?

14:08.600 --> 14:11.301
Nice follow-through.

14:11.353 --> 14:13.386
Let's, uh... how about we go fishing?

14:13.388 --> 14:15.472
Fishing. That sounds like fun.

14:15.524 --> 14:18.391
Wait. Hold up. There's fish in that swamp?

14:18.393 --> 14:21.595
- Yeah, of course there are.
- And you expect us to eat them?

14:21.630 --> 14:23.280
Yes, you're going to eat them.

14:23.315 --> 14:26.399
It's gonna be a Fosters
family fishing expedition!

14:26.401 --> 14:29.569
We're gonna catch and
eat our food tonight! Yay!

14:29.605 --> 14:31.321
Let's do it, huh? Come
on, you guys, let's do it.

14:31.373 --> 14:33.240
Everybody grab a pole! Got some bait!

14:33.292 --> 14:34.491
It's gonna be awesome! Here we go!

14:34.543 --> 14:37.244
[Lena] Make sure everyone has a pole.

14:37.246 --> 14:39.162
Here, here, take it.

14:41.583 --> 14:47.254
Well, I, uh, I think you taught us all
a little something about patience today.

14:47.256 --> 14:49.422
And we're all gonna try a
bite of this, right, kids?

14:51.477 --> 14:54.561
- Thank God we brought burgers.
- I thought you didn't eat meat.

14:54.596 --> 14:58.315
Hey, we are out here in the middle
of nowhere, fighting for our lives.

14:58.350 --> 15:00.050
I'm in survival mode.

15:00.302 --> 15:03.136
- Ow!
- Did you put bug spray on, Jude?

15:03.172 --> 15:06.056
- No.
- Come on, you know mosquitoes love you.

15:06.091 --> 15:07.507
'Cause you're so sweet.

15:07.509 --> 15:09.409
Watch us get malaria.

15:09.445 --> 15:14.097
Come here, I'll spray you
down. Arms out. Shut your eyes.

15:16.101 --> 15:18.185
[coughing]

15:18.187 --> 15:20.187
What if Hayley comes looking
for me? Moms'll freak.

15:20.189 --> 15:23.073
- Relax. She's not gonna do that.
- You don't know Hayley.

15:23.108 --> 15:24.441
I'm surprised she already hasn't turned up.

15:24.493 --> 15:28.128
I gotta get to her before
she does. Cover for me.

15:28.163 --> 15:30.247
- What?
- I've gotta go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

15:30.282 --> 15:33.366
Hey, you know the drill. It's almost
dark out. Two at a time, please.

15:33.419 --> 15:36.269
I know where the bathroom is, Mom. I
don't know why we need that rule out here.

15:36.305 --> 15:39.372
Because we're in the woods,
Jesus. And we have to be careful.

15:39.374 --> 15:41.541
- Of what?
- Well, of bears, for one thing.

15:41.577 --> 15:45.378
Which reminds me, we gotta be
careful about scraps out here. OK?

15:45.431 --> 15:47.380
We can't leave anything out
that might draw them over.

15:47.382 --> 15:51.051
Um, I'm sorry. Did you just say bears?

15:51.103 --> 15:53.386
Well, yeah, honey. This is bear country.

15:53.439 --> 15:57.491
I think the campground website said
something about a sighting just last week.

15:57.526 --> 15:59.226
So keep that in mind.

16:59.204 --> 17:01.338
Ooh! Play that song you wrote for Lou.

17:01.390 --> 17:05.291
- What song?
- You know, the one you guys played at the party.

17:05.294 --> 17:07.294
What party would this be?

17:08.513 --> 17:11.381
Uh... Oh, just a friend's.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.215

You should play it.

I didn't write that for Lou.

It's what it looked like on stage.
You guys were totally vibing.

OK, is that like twerking? Is
that the same as twerking? What?

17:27.148 --> 17:29.316
So is something going
on between you and Lou?

Yeah, they're totally dating, duh.

17:32.487 --> 17:35.155
[Stef] Well, isn't that interesting?

17:35.190 --> 17:38.124
I wonder why you didn't
mention that during your pitch

17:38.160 --> 17:41.394
- for going away on tour this summer.
- Yes, I wonder.

17:41.430 --> 17:44.331
That certainly adds
another matter to consider.

17:44.366 --> 17:46.383
You know, there's nothing we can
do on tour that we can't do at home.

17:46.418 --> 17:51.421
But can we just talk
about this later, maybe?

17:51.473 --> 17:54.341
I think maybe we should talk about putting
cameras in the garage. What do you think?

Hey, I'm trying to get them
to let me go on tour. OK?

and check for trash one last time.

- We already did that.

Where did he go? And
don't say the bathroom.

She's at another campsite.

- But you can't tell. OK?
- OK.

21:31.243 --> 21:34.244
- Should I come with you?
- No, no. Stay here. I'll be back.

- What's going on?

22:14.069 --> 22:15.952
What's wrong, baby?

- Well, they're not in the men's room.
- They're not in the women's either.

22:22.793 --> 22:25.093
They knew to go to the
bathroom in pairs, so...

22:25.095 --> 22:27.763
I'm starting to get worried. Jude
said they've been gone for hours.

22:27.815 --> 22:30.766
They're just lost.

campsite. I had to go look for her.

- [Brandon] Well, now so are we.

star. Maybe we're that way.

- Don't shine your light on it.
- Why not?

out the way you planned.

24:03.894 --> 24:05.160

24:05.195 --> 24:06.995
I was gonna text her
and tell her not to come,

- Well...

- I told him to tell you guys.
- Thank you.

24:12.566 --> 24:15.787
- For what it's worth.
- For what it's worth, why didn't you tell us?

- 'Cause I'm not a narc.
- Like some people.

24:20.878 --> 24:24.045
Hey. Jude did the right thing. You guys
could have been in danger out there.

24:24.097 --> 24:26.765
And Brandon, the lack
of judgment on your part

24:26.800 --> 24:29.184
is not making a very strong
case for going on tour.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.152
So what are you guys gonna do about Hayley?

24:31.188 --> 24:33.889
[Stef] Until we get in touch with her mom,

24:33.941 --> 24:36.975
not gonna let her go home alone.
So for now, we're stuck with her.

Good morning.

Sorry I ruined your family trip.

Hard to ruin something
that already kinda sucked.

24:59.182 --> 25:01.783
My mom went away with her
new boyfriend this weekend,

25:01.818 --> 25:05.687
and I just didn't wanna be home alone.

25:05.722 --> 25:10.008
- Your parents really got divorced?
- Yeah.

25:13.931 --> 25:17.148
- I miss you on the team.
- Really?

25:17.184 --> 25:20.936
And Kaitlyn is like a bitch
times a billion since you left.

- She's so freaked out by your new team.

25:23.073 --> 25:26.775
Yeah, our team of two.

25:26.777 --> 25:28.843
You guys already have the
best dancers at school.

25:28.879 --> 25:30.745
Well, there's two we don't have.

25:32.916 --> 25:34.916
What you guys did was pretty awesome.

25:34.952 --> 25:37.118
Putting Kaitlyn in her place.

25:37.154 --> 25:39.154
Nobody else had the guts to do it.

25:41.892 --> 25:43.091

Well, why don't you?

little adventure last night.
