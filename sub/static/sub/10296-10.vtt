Steve's been gone

Al, did you
have to come home?

Well, the summer place

01:57.033 --> 01:58.033

Why aren't we having
the party at her house?

Was it because
all Steve's friends

Al would get aroused.

I'll buy you something.

11:49.801 --> 11:52.868
Thanks, Al, but I won't
be home tonight.

11:52.868 --> 11:54.367
What's the matter, buddy?
You upset about something?

11:54.367 --> 11:55.868
Is it Peggy?
Did she say something?

11:55.868 --> 11:56.968
Because let me know.

11:56.968 --> 11:59.334
If she did, she'll be
out of here by night!

12:01.534 --> 12:03.567
Nope, Al,
it's not Peggy.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.567
I've got to go to a
banker's banquet tonight.

12:05.567 --> 12:08.200
Marcie and I both
have to be there.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.667
But you're not going to...
talk to her, are you?

12:12.667 --> 12:15.033
No, no, but we agreed
to go together

12:15.033 --> 12:16.434
for appearances' sake.

12:16.434 --> 12:20.334
This banquet's important
to both our careers.

12:20.334 --> 12:21.467
It would be really
uncomfortable

12:21.467 --> 12:22.634
for me to be there
with her.

12:22.634 --> 12:24.033
I mean, I haven't
seen her for five days.

12:24.033 --> 12:26.467
I haven't touched her,
smelled her,

12:26.467 --> 12:28.767
I haven't buried my face
in her--

12:28.767 --> 12:31.634
Steve!

12:31.634 --> 12:33.234
Remember
what's important here.

12:33.234 --> 12:37.968
You have a beard and
a family to take care of.

12:37.968 --> 12:41.701
Al, I'm horny!

12:41.701 --> 12:43.200
I'm thinking
of shaving.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.334
Yes!

12:44.334 --> 12:45.400
No!

12:45.400 --> 12:46.901
Al, calm down.

12:46.901 --> 12:49.767
Can we go someplace
private to talk?

12:49.767 --> 12:50.968
Sure, buddy.

12:50.968 --> 12:53.200
Peg, get out of here!

12:53.200 --> 12:55.133
Fine.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.367
I think I'll go upstairs

12:56.367 --> 12:58.000
and look through
the photo album.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.434
You know, I think I have
a picture of Marcie...

13:01.434 --> 13:03.667
last summer,
washing the car...

13:03.667 --> 13:07.033
You know, when she
got her t-shirt wet,

13:07.033 --> 13:11.467
and you said something about...
taking her for a little spin,

13:11.467 --> 13:14.467
but you didn't use the car?

13:14.467 --> 13:18.701
You know. That picture?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.501
I'm shaving, Al.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.567
I've never seen
a t-shirt that wet.

13:24.567 --> 13:27.400
Sit down, Steve.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.868
I can't, Al.

13:35.734 --> 13:38.033
Steve, I'm going to
tell you a little something

13:38.033 --> 13:39.767
I learned about life.

13:39.767 --> 13:42.701
Oh, good, at the feet
of the master again.

13:42.701 --> 13:44.133
The way I see it,

13:44.133 --> 13:47.567
Nature played
a cruel trick on us.

13:47.567 --> 13:50.601
Well, it did move us
next door to each other.

13:50.601 --> 13:51.601
All right, two tricks,

13:51.601 --> 13:53.534
but I'm talking
about the one

13:53.534 --> 13:56.400
that keeps us men
from ruling the Earth.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.834
See, nature gave men the urge
and women the answer.

13:59.834 --> 14:02.834
Sure, it's not much,
but it's all they need.

14:02.834 --> 14:05.267
Gee, I wish nature
gave us everything,

14:05.267 --> 14:06.767
like the worm...

14:06.767 --> 14:09.434
or like that guy who works
down at the antique store,

14:09.434 --> 14:15.467
but...nobody asked me,
and now it's too late.

14:15.467 --> 14:20.000
God, that was
a wet t-shirt.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.767
Steve, think dry here
for a minute, will you?

14:23.767 --> 14:25.601
See, the problem is...

14:25.601 --> 14:28.434
women know
we have these urges,

14:28.434 --> 14:31.434
but they have
the same urges we do.

14:31.434 --> 14:33.934
They just don't
show it because...

14:33.934 --> 14:37.100
Well, that's how
spiteful they are.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.100
But, Steve, they need us

14:39.100 --> 14:42.100
just as much
as we need them.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.901
Why? Because we
can do the job,

14:45.901 --> 14:48.901
and you can't
take a battery home

14:48.901 --> 14:50.901
to meet your mother.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.567
There.
I've said my piece.

14:56.567 --> 15:00.100
Now, what are you going
to do about it, buddy?

15:00.100 --> 15:03.067
I'm going to shave
and rock the house.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.534
The beard itches, Al.

15:04.534 --> 15:07.534
I'm sick of it,
and I look stupid.

15:07.534 --> 15:09.901
Well, I know you do,
Steve,

15:09.901 --> 15:11.901
but at least you've
got your pride.

15:11.901 --> 15:13.901
Oh, a guy like you

15:13.901 --> 15:17.734
can get sex
anytime he wants to,

15:17.734 --> 15:21.767
but it's pride that
keeps our pants up, Steve.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.267
Just say "no."

15:24.934 --> 15:27.767
You know something, Al?
You're right.

15:27.767 --> 15:30.267
Evolution may
have passed you by,

15:30.267 --> 15:31.767
but you're right.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.167
I know I am.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.334
I'm making a point
here.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.334
I'm fighting
the good fight.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.501
You're right, Steve.

15:36.501 --> 15:39.434
Steve, when you get back
from this banker thing,

15:39.434 --> 15:40.601
I'll still be up.

15:40.601 --> 15:41.667
Do you suppose

15:41.667 --> 15:42.801
you could make those
little brown potatoes?

15:42.801 --> 15:45.067
I love those.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.634
I waited till they left.
What's the big news?

15:53.634 --> 15:55.167
Steve is horny.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.100
I can tell.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.601
Your house is clean.

15:58.601 --> 16:01.567
Is he ready
to shave the beard?

16:01.567 --> 16:02.834
Almost, but of course,

16:02.834 --> 16:04.868
we have
the usual obstacle.

16:04.868 --> 16:07.334
What's Al doing?

16:07.334 --> 16:10.234
Making Steve hold out
until you give in.

16:10.234 --> 16:11.767
Ha ha ha.

16:11.767 --> 16:14.601
It will be
a cold day in--

16:14.601 --> 16:17.267
Oh, God, I need him.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.100
Calm down,
Marcie.

16:20.100 --> 16:26.801
Ohh, this is one
of Steve's socks.

16:26.801 --> 16:31.868
Yes, but Al's
been wearing it.

16:34.334 --> 16:36.100
Oh, Peggy, what am I
going to do?

16:36.100 --> 16:38.434
I don't know how much longer
I can hold out...

16:38.434 --> 16:40.901
but I will not give up
my principles

16:40.901 --> 16:42.567
for an hour and a half
of pleasure.

16:42.567 --> 16:47.634
Look, you don't have
to give up any--

16:47.634 --> 16:51.133
An hour and a half?

16:51.133 --> 16:54.133
If you add up
all the sex

16:54.133 --> 16:56.634
Al and I
have ever had,

16:56.634 --> 17:00.567
it still doesn't come to
an hour and a half--

17:00.567 --> 17:02.834
at least
not of pleasure.

17:02.834 --> 17:05.334
Oh, well. Look, you can
keep your principles

17:05.334 --> 17:07.000
and still have Steve.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.067
Marcie, I only
want your happiness,

17:10.067 --> 17:12.166
preferably
at your own house,

17:12.166 --> 17:13.666
because, you see,

17:13.666 --> 17:16.666
now I have healthy kids,
a happy husband,

17:16.666 --> 17:19.666
and it has just
got to stop.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.000
So why don't you
do this?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.666
Tonight, when you pick up
Steve for this banker thing,

17:23.666 --> 17:25.501
why don't you wear
the sleaziest,

17:25.501 --> 17:28.667
sexiest, sluttiest
outfit you can find?

17:28.667 --> 17:30.200
I'll loan you
something.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.367
I couldn't do that.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.868
Our relationship
isn't based on that.

17:35.868 --> 17:37.200
Oh, please.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.200
Then what does it mean

17:39.200 --> 17:42.200
When you're screaming, "Oh,
God! Oh, God! Oh, God!"

17:42.200 --> 17:43.868
yet you never
go to church?

17:46.467 --> 17:48.467
Marcie, let me
tell you

17:48.467 --> 17:50.467
a little
something about men.

17:50.467 --> 17:53.467
You see, nature played
a very cruel joke on them.

17:53.467 --> 17:56.467
It gave them
a source of pleasure,

17:56.467 --> 17:58.000
but in order
for it to work,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.234
the blood has
to leave the brain,

18:02.234 --> 18:05.434
and, you see, it
leaves them confused...

18:05.434 --> 18:06.501
disoriented...

18:06.501 --> 18:10.033
and eager to enter
into negotiations,

18:10.033 --> 18:15.133
because the brain
wants that blood back.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.501
You see, it needs it
to go to work

18:17.501 --> 18:18.968
to pay for
all those things

18:18.968 --> 18:22.501
it agreed to
only moments before.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.167
You see,
Marcie,

18:24.167 --> 18:26.667
we may not have
upper-body strength,

18:26.667 --> 18:29.167
but we do have
sexual kryptonite.

18:29.167 --> 18:32.667
Use it, Marcie. Have him
shave that beard.

18:32.667 --> 18:35.167
Aw, hell. Have him
shave his head--

18:35.167 --> 18:36.567
for me.

18:36.567 --> 18:39.701
No. I will not
stoop as low

18:39.701 --> 18:42.701
as to use sexual bartering
in our marriage.

18:42.701 --> 18:44.534
I'll appeal
to his intellect.

18:44.534 --> 18:46.367
We'll have
a rational discussion,

18:46.367 --> 18:47.868
and he'll shave

18:47.868 --> 18:49.934
because he'll see
I'm right.

18:49.934 --> 18:51.767
Do you have
any batteries?

18:56.167 --> 18:58.367
I hate this beard!

18:58.367 --> 19:02.901
Just say "no."

19:03.968 --> 19:06.467
I don't think I can, Al.

19:06.467 --> 19:09.467
Marcie's going to be here soon.

19:09.467 --> 19:13.267
I was looking up dresses
at work today, Al.

19:13.267 --> 19:16.701
Perfectly natural.

19:16.701 --> 19:20.334
It's natural in your business.
You're a shoe salesman.

19:20.334 --> 19:22.133
A bank manager has to put
the security cameras

19:22.133 --> 19:23.367
on the floor to do that.

19:23.367 --> 19:26.834
I did that today, Al.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.634
I'm going to cave.
I just know it.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.167
I know you are, too, Steve.

19:31.167 --> 19:34.100
That's why
I have a gift for you...

19:34.100 --> 19:37.767
a very special gift.

19:37.767 --> 19:40.267
I didn't want to do this

19:40.267 --> 19:42.267
until it was
absolutely necessary,

19:42.267 --> 19:43.801
but, uh, sit down.

19:43.801 --> 19:48.234
Clear your mind...

19:48.234 --> 19:51.400
think of Marcie...

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
and take a look at...

19:53.400 --> 19:55.234
my mother-in-law!

19:55.234 --> 19:58.868
Aah!

20:07.133 --> 20:10.901
Everybody says that.

20:10.901 --> 20:12.400
Yep. Look at her,

20:12.400 --> 20:15.567
bending over
at the beach.

20:15.567 --> 20:19.100
Summer of '71.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.634
Notice
the perspiration

20:21.634 --> 20:24.901
percolating in the folds
of her flesh.

20:27.100 --> 20:32.601
You may wonder why her
upper arms are blurry.

20:32.601 --> 20:34.901
There was a breeze...

20:37.434 --> 20:40.234
and we caught them
in midflap.

20:46.601 --> 20:50.000
Thanks, Al.
I'm okay now.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.367
Steve, take it,

20:51.367 --> 20:54.067
and if you should get
the urge at this banquet,

20:54.067 --> 20:55.133
take at look at it.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.934
It's also good
for dieting.

21:05.367 --> 21:06.634
Marcie.

21:06.634 --> 21:08.634
Steve.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.033
Your hair. You changed it.

21:11.033 --> 21:13.968
Yes. Like it?

21:17.734 --> 21:20.234
Not really.

21:20.234 --> 21:21.767
Are we ready?

21:21.767 --> 21:24.067
All right, Steve.

21:24.067 --> 21:26.701
But first,
I have something to say.

21:26.701 --> 21:31.100
With regards to your beard,
though it is your face,

21:31.100 --> 21:33.133
it has affected both of us.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.601
It does not enhance
your business persona,

21:35.601 --> 21:37.601
and it makes me
terribly unhappy,

21:37.601 --> 21:38.701
so I appeal to your
intelligence,

21:38.701 --> 21:40.601
sensitivity, and good judgment

21:40.601 --> 21:43.534
by asking you to please
shave the beard.

21:43.534 --> 21:45.767
No.

21:45.767 --> 21:48.367
In that case...

21:54.200 --> 21:56.067
[BUZZ]

22:09.801 --> 22:12.801
Peg, you know those
little brown potatoes

22:12.801 --> 22:14.467
that Steve makes?

22:14.467 --> 22:17.300
Can you do that?

22:17.300 --> 22:19.801
Al, you know
about making love

22:19.801 --> 22:23.300
for an hour and a half
like Steve does?

22:23.300 --> 22:28.701
Can you do that?

22:28.701 --> 22:30.734
Burger King?

22:30.734 --> 22:32.534
Yeah.

22:43.968 --> 22:47.200
