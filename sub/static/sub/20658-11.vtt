WEBVTT

00:12.880 --> 00:14.382
Thank you, thank you.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.583
Hi, I'm Dr. Todd Bodd

00:15.583 --> 00:17.085
and welcome to "Doc Talk ."

00:17.085 --> 00:18.119
Today, we're talking about the

00:18.119 --> 00:19.887
healing power of vitamins.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.289
This is Debbie, a volunteer

00:21.289 --> 00:21.955
from our audience.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.591
Now, Debbie, do you take your

00:23.591 --> 00:24.458
vitamins?

00:24.458 --> 00:25.726
I do.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.096
Good girl.

00:28.096 --> 00:31.099
You're very handsome.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.066
Oh!

00:32.066 --> 00:32.733
Oh, you--

00:32.733 --> 00:34.068
you can go back to your seat.

00:34.068 --> 00:34.768
Let's get her back.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.969
Okay.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.105
Thank you, thank you, Debbie.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.774
Vitamins are the key to health

00:40.774 --> 00:41.642
and perhaps the cure

00:41.642 --> 00:43.111
for the common cold.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.245
Now, how many of you have ever

00:44.245 --> 00:46.447
heard of vitamin megadoses?

00:46.447 --> 00:47.115
Ooh, ooh!

00:47.115 --> 00:48.116
I have!

00:48.116 --> 00:49.317
But I've also heard of fairies

00:49.317 --> 00:50.484
and the Loch Ness monster, and

00:50.484 --> 00:51.485
those won't cure your cold

00:51.485 --> 00:52.253
either.

00:52.253 --> 00:52.920
What?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.088
Vitamins supplements don't

00:54.088 --> 00:55.123
cure colds.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.590
They don't prolong your life.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.791
And in some cases, they may

00:57.791 --> 00:59.793
actually be harmful.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.461
Who are you?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.496
- Hi, I'm Adam Conover, and

01:02.496 --> 01:04.598
this is "Adam Ruins Everything."

01:04.598 --> 01:05.266
We're doing kind of a

01:05.266 --> 01:05.966
show-within-the-show

01:05.966 --> 01:06.634
thing here today.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.301
See, look.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.269
Here's my camera,

01:08.269 --> 01:09.137
there's your camera. See?

01:09.137 --> 01:10.338
My camera, your camera.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.505
Your camera is on my camera.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.806
Ooh, so meta.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.474
Sorry, I've never heard of

01:13.474 --> 01:14.275
your show.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.609
I'm a little busy with my own

01:15.609 --> 01:16.477
show here.

01:20.013 --> 01:20.948
Okay, well, which would you

01:20.948 --> 01:22.183
guy rather see?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.317
His dumb show about how you

01:23.317 --> 01:24.818
should take your vitamins,

01:24.818 --> 01:26.787
or my show about a mad scientist

01:26.787 --> 01:27.988
who fooled a nation?

01:30.158 --> 01:30.824
Also, on my show,

01:30.824 --> 01:34.795
he takes his shirt off.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.331
Yay! My show wins!

01:37.331 --> 01:40.301
♪♪

01:49.510 --> 01:51.979
So, what are vitamins?

01:51.979 --> 01:53.046
Huge pills that smell

01:53.046 --> 01:54.014
like old olives?

01:54.014 --> 01:55.349
Wrong, anyone else?

01:55.349 --> 01:56.016
Here we go.

01:56.016 --> 01:56.884
Uh, candy that's shaped like

01:56.884 --> 01:57.885
cartoon characters.

01:57.885 --> 01:58.819
Wrong again.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.487
You're both thinking

01:59.487 --> 02:01.389
of vitamin supplements.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.156
What are the vitamins

02:02.156 --> 02:03.491
themselves?

02:03.491 --> 02:04.392
Little bits of goop

02:04.392 --> 02:05.393
that your body needs?

02:05.393 --> 02:06.327
I love you, Todd.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.060
Exactly.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.196
They're a collection of various

02:08.196 --> 02:09.397
micronutrients that are

02:09.397 --> 02:10.698
essential for your body to

02:10.698 --> 02:11.832
function normally.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.334
Yes, so vitamins make

02:13.334 --> 02:14.001
us healthy.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.669
Except that by definition,

02:15.669 --> 02:17.505
vitamins are nutrients we only

02:17.505 --> 02:18.906
need a tiny little bit of.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.208
And normally, we get plenty of

02:20.208 --> 02:21.342
them from the food we eat.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.176
Arr!

02:22.176 --> 02:24.845
But what if I contract scurvy?

02:24.845 --> 02:25.546
You won't.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.348
Scurvy is caused by an extreme

02:27.348 --> 02:28.582
lack of vitamin C.

02:28.582 --> 02:29.550
Pirates used to get it because

02:29.550 --> 02:30.851
they ate nothing but hardtack

02:30.851 --> 02:32.085
biscuits for months.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.086
But if you eat normal food in

02:33.086 --> 02:34.255
normal quantities,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.223
you'll be fine, like,

02:35.223 --> 02:37.691
just eat a lemon, ever.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.759
Mmm.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.261
I feel better already, indeed!

02:40.261 --> 02:41.429
But getting more vitamins is

02:41.429 --> 02:42.363
even better!

02:42.363 --> 02:43.231
No, it isn't.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.565
Vitamins are sort of like cats.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.699
If you have no cats,

02:45.699 --> 02:46.567
you'll be lonely.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.435
If you have a cat or two,

02:47.435 --> 02:48.369
you'll feel better.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.703
But that's enough cats.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.171
No one needs to load up on cats.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.074
And just like with cats, you

02:54.074 --> 02:55.409
don't want to overdo it.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.410
Studies show that taking too

02:56.410 --> 02:57.911
much of some vitamins, like A,

02:57.911 --> 02:59.380
D, or E, can actually

02:59.380 --> 03:00.414
make you sick.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.882
Well, even if that's true,

03:01.882 --> 03:02.583
megadoses of

03:02.583 --> 03:03.884
vitamin C will cure--

03:03.884 --> 03:04.752
Nothing.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.754
Vitamin C does not treat or cure

03:06.754 --> 03:08.088
the common cold and products

03:08.088 --> 03:10.391
that claim it does are nonsense.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.096
Remember Airborne?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.231
Sure, the cold medicine

03:17.231 --> 03:18.599
created by a schoolteacher.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.600
It keeps you from getting colds

03:19.600 --> 03:20.301
from touching the magazines

03:20.301 --> 03:21.134
on airplanes.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.570
That is not true.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.971
Who gave you a medical license?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.239
Oprah.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.139
Airborne is a cocktail of

03:26.139 --> 03:27.575
plain old vitamins that was

03:27.575 --> 03:28.776
marketed as a cure for

03:28.776 --> 03:29.710
the common cold.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.246
But in 2006, they were sued for

03:32.246 --> 03:34.081
false advertising and ended up

03:34.081 --> 03:36.750
paying out $23 million.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.586
Airborne doesn't cure anything.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.053
It's basically just bubbles.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.791
When I take vitamin C,

03:43.791 --> 03:46.827
it makes me feel better.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.262
Yes, the placebo effect is

03:48.262 --> 03:49.763
very powerful.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.265
But that's all it is.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.933
In reality, at least 15

03:52.933 --> 03:54.602
different studies have concluded

03:54.602 --> 03:56.637
that vitamin C does not treat

03:56.637 --> 03:57.471
the common cold.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.443
Hey, it's not my fault everyone

04:02.443 --> 04:04.111
believes vitamins are magic.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.646
It's Linus Pauling's fault.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.614
Great, can I go back to doing

04:06.614 --> 04:07.448
my show now?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.016
No, no, no, do not pan away!

04:09.016 --> 04:09.850
Come on!

04:09.850 --> 04:11.285
Linus Pauling was a genius

04:11.285 --> 04:12.620
chemist and the only person in

04:12.620 --> 04:14.488
history to be awarded two solo

04:14.488 --> 04:15.523
Nobel prizes.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.657
He was one of America's true

04:16.657 --> 04:18.326
scientific celebrities.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.960
Linus, I love your chemistry!

04:19.960 --> 04:21.829
Your research is amazing!

04:21.829 --> 04:22.830
But in the early '70s,

04:22.830 --> 04:24.298
Pauling became obsessed with

04:24.298 --> 04:26.199
the idea of living forever and

04:26.199 --> 04:28.268
basically went vitamin-crazy.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.306
Great Neils Bohr's ghost!

04:32.306 --> 04:33.507
I've got it.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.308
He began claiming that

04:34.308 --> 04:35.709
massive doses of vitamin C could

04:35.709 --> 04:37.177
prevent the common cold, prolong

04:37.177 --> 04:39.813
your life and even cure cancer.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.481
and because has was

04:40.481 --> 04:41.815
a celebrity scientist,

04:41.815 --> 04:43.817
the media trusted him.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.718
So these vita-pills

04:44.718 --> 04:45.819
will cure my sniffles?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.154
That's right, and get this:

04:47.154 --> 04:48.689
You'll also never get sick

04:48.689 --> 04:50.190
or die.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.859
Sounds pretty far out.

04:51.859 --> 04:52.526
Oh, yeah.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.694
But if the smartest cat in

04:53.694 --> 04:54.695
America is saying it,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.864
it must be true.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.831
Up next is Charo

04:57.831 --> 04:59.333
and puppet superstar Madam.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.534
No, no, no, no!

05:00.534 --> 05:01.201
No, you don't.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.002
We are going back to my show.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.737
Where is it?

05:03.737 --> 05:04.638
This way!

05:06.374 --> 05:08.376
But repeated studies have proven

05:08.376 --> 05:10.210
that Pauling was totally wrong.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.712
There is no medical basis

05:11.712 --> 05:14.181
for his claims, and in 1994,

05:14.181 --> 05:16.183
he actually died of cancer,

05:16.183 --> 05:17.851
the very disease he claimed

05:17.851 --> 05:19.387
vitamins would cure.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.187
You're telling me that

05:20.187 --> 05:21.722
vitamin supplements are a lie

05:21.722 --> 05:23.056
and we only believe in them

05:23.056 --> 05:25.526
because one man went crazy.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.193
Yeah.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.395
Pauling was the Michael Jackson

05:27.395 --> 05:28.228
of nutrition.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.563
He totally changed the game.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.532
We had no idea how crazy he was,

05:31.532 --> 05:32.933
and 40 years later, we're still

05:32.933 --> 05:34.368
humming the tunes.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.369
Wow.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.036
That's bad.

05:36.036 --> 05:36.704
It's bad.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.505
You know it.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.713
Um, so we shouldn't

05:45.713 --> 05:46.880
listen to experts?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.248
No, of course you should.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.383
You just need to remember that

05:49.383 --> 05:51.118
experts can be wrong, too,

05:51.118 --> 05:52.620
so you still need to critically

05:52.620 --> 05:54.254
examine ideas, even when they

05:54.254 --> 05:56.557
come from a certifiable genius,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.559
or a very handsome TV show host.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.427
Oh, thank you.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.093
Sure.

06:00.093 --> 06:00.961
You too.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.129
All right, you've told your

06:02.129 --> 06:03.564
little vitamin story.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.598
Neato.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.266
Now, get out of here and go ruin

06:06.266 --> 06:07.735
Kathie Lee and Hoda.

06:07.735 --> 06:08.402
Oh, that's impossible.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.103
They are way too likeable.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.038
Go.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.443
Okay, everyone, reset.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.444
Back to one.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.080
I don't know what that was,

06:20.080 --> 06:21.148
but it's over.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.149
When we come back, I'll be

06:22.149 --> 06:23.617
talking about the most important

06:23.617 --> 06:24.752
meal of the day.

06:24.752 --> 06:25.453
Breakfast.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.454
And I'll be talking about how

06:26.454 --> 06:27.421
everything you know about

06:27.421 --> 06:28.456
breakfast is wrong.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.423
We have security.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.290
How does this keep happening?

06:33.126 --> 06:33.927
Whoa!

06:33.927 --> 06:35.629
I love Honey Toasted Crunchies.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.464
Me too.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.431
Well, I love that they're

06:37.431 --> 06:38.799
part of a balanced breakfast.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.601
Actually, they're not.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.802
Also, I think your refrigerator

06:41.802 --> 06:42.936
shelves are broken.

06:42.936 --> 06:43.771
I know they are.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.605
I broke them.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.273
And you're out of mayo.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.274
What's happening?

06:47.274 --> 06:48.275
Adam, just let them finish

06:48.275 --> 06:49.109
the commercial so we can go

06:49.109 --> 06:50.444
back to my show.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.445
Sorry, but this commercial

06:51.445 --> 06:53.280
is full of lies.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.448
First of all, why do these ads

06:54.448 --> 06:55.282
always have so much food?

06:55.282 --> 06:56.283
Who's eating this much?

06:56.283 --> 06:57.618
And secondly, this "balanced

06:57.618 --> 06:59.019
breakfast" is anything but.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.821
Come on, I'll show you!

07:00.821 --> 07:01.955
I am so sorry.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.156
Let's start with O.J.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.191
Juice commercials would have you

07:04.191 --> 07:05.959
believe that every sip comes

07:05.959 --> 07:06.860
right from the tree.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.628
Right.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.962
Orange juice is totally natural.

07:08.962 --> 07:09.663
Look.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.698
There's a straw

07:10.698 --> 07:11.965
right in the orange.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.000
It's like I'm drinking

07:13.000 --> 07:14.134
straight from the fruit.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.803
Man, you really are gullible.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.470
Yeah?

07:16.470 --> 07:17.805
Even "not from concentrate"

07:17.805 --> 07:18.839
orange juice is just as

07:18.839 --> 07:20.541
processed as any other mass

07:20.541 --> 07:21.642
market food.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.043
Orange juice has an extremely

07:23.043 --> 07:24.478
short shelf life, so to stop it

07:24.478 --> 07:25.879
from spoiling, manufacturers

07:25.879 --> 07:27.515
extract all the oxygen

07:27.515 --> 07:28.348
from the juice.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.350
(mechanical twriling, beeping)

07:32.986 --> 07:34.488
Oxygen removal complete.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.656
But that process also

07:35.656 --> 07:37.491
removes all the orange flavor.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.492
It just tastes like...

07:38.492 --> 07:39.159
sweet.

07:39.159 --> 07:39.827
Right.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.028
So manufacturers artificially

07:41.028 --> 07:42.563
jam it back in by using

07:42.563 --> 07:43.997
flavor packs.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.833
That can't be natural.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.000
It's not.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.835
The taste that you know as

07:47.835 --> 07:49.537
Tropicana, Florida's Natural

07:49.537 --> 07:50.871
or Minute Maid was actually

07:50.871 --> 07:52.339
designed in the same lab that

07:52.339 --> 07:54.007
makes perfume for Calvin Klein

07:54.007 --> 07:55.843
and Dior.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.210
Oh, citrusy!

07:57.210 --> 07:58.345
The trick is, since the flavor

07:58.345 --> 07:59.346
packs are technically made

07:59.346 --> 08:00.548
of orange byproducts,

08:00.548 --> 08:01.348
they don't have to write

08:01.348 --> 08:02.249
"artificially flavored"

08:02.249 --> 08:04.184
on the label, but they are.

08:04.184 --> 08:04.918
Well, if it's all oranges,

08:04.918 --> 08:05.586
who cares?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.253
Yeah.

08:06.253 --> 08:06.920
Flavor packs aren't bad

08:06.920 --> 08:07.588
for you, they're just

08:07.588 --> 08:09.523
super interesting.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.858
Uh-huh.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.759
Well, great.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.526
What's bad for you about

08:12.526 --> 08:14.695
orange juice is the sugar.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.929
What sugar?

08:15.929 --> 08:16.930
Kind of a strong reaction.

08:16.930 --> 08:17.765
You didn't know this?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.533
O.J. is loaded with it.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.601
An eight-ounce glass of

08:20.601 --> 08:22.603
Tropicana contains 22 grams

08:22.603 --> 08:23.537
of sugar.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.437
That's almost as much as a

08:24.437 --> 08:26.540
Pepsi, which makes sense, since

08:26.540 --> 08:28.208
Tropicana is owned by Pepsi.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.577
Really?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.044
Oh, man.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.079
Network says I'm fired if

08:32.079 --> 08:33.213
I can't keep my weight down.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.617
It's milk for me.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.718
Does a body good.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.386
Where'd you hear that?

08:39.386 --> 08:40.053
TV?

08:40.053 --> 08:41.388
Ah, more empty advertising.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.223
Come on!

08:43.223 --> 08:44.391
You mean all those fun milk

08:44.391 --> 08:45.458
PSAs from the '90s?

08:45.458 --> 08:46.226
Those weren't ads.

08:46.226 --> 08:46.894
They were trying

08:46.894 --> 08:47.561
to keep us healthy.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.395
Sorry, Todd.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.297
But those PSAs were just

08:50.297 --> 08:52.132
for-profit marketing paid for

08:52.132 --> 08:53.901
by the dairy industry.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.268
Milk's got stuff that's good

08:55.268 --> 08:57.638
for my bones and stuff that's

08:57.638 --> 08:58.438
good for my muscles.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.574
Strong bones, beautiful skin

09:00.574 --> 09:01.975
and a healthy body.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.310
All that protein for muscle,

09:03.310 --> 09:05.646
and calcium for bones.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.647
We've been fed claims like

09:06.647 --> 09:08.415
these ever since we were kids,

09:08.415 --> 09:10.483
but none of them are true.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.952
Repeated research has shown

09:11.952 --> 09:13.420
that milk does not help you

09:13.420 --> 09:14.588
build strong bones.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.923
In fact, one study found that

09:15.923 --> 09:17.257
people who drink a lot of milk

09:17.257 --> 09:18.592
are at a higher rate

09:18.592 --> 09:19.459
of bone fracture.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.794
Okay, but we need milk

09:20.794 --> 09:21.962
for calcium.

09:21.962 --> 09:22.596
You know,

09:22.596 --> 09:23.764
there's calcium everywhere.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.666
Gram for gram, most dried herbs

09:25.666 --> 09:27.434
have more calcium than milk.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.101
Oh, hey,

09:28.101 --> 09:28.936
it's Alissa Hamilton,

09:28.936 --> 09:29.637
and she's a journalist

09:29.637 --> 09:30.604
who's written extensively

09:30.604 --> 09:31.672
about the orange juice

09:31.672 --> 09:32.973
and dairy industries.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.441
Milk is not the wonder food

09:34.441 --> 09:36.443
that we once thought it was.

09:36.443 --> 09:39.112
A glass of plain milk has 13

09:39.112 --> 09:40.948
grams of naturally occurring

09:40.948 --> 09:41.949
sugar.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.116
More sugar?

09:43.116 --> 09:43.951
I hate sugar!

09:43.951 --> 09:45.285
We've been told our entire

09:45.285 --> 09:46.954
lives that milk is some kind of

09:46.954 --> 09:48.789
nutritional necessity,

09:48.789 --> 09:49.690
but it's not.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.124
It's just another product being

09:51.124 --> 09:53.326
marketed like any other.

09:53.326 --> 09:53.994
What are we supposed

09:53.994 --> 09:54.795
to put on our cereal, then?

09:54.795 --> 09:55.462
Water?

09:55.462 --> 09:56.296
Ugh!

09:56.296 --> 09:56.964
Maybe it's time we let go

09:56.964 --> 09:57.965
of cereal, too.

09:59.032 --> 09:59.700
What?

09:59.700 --> 10:00.367
But we love our

10:00.367 --> 10:01.635
Honey Toasted Crunchies.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.003
I'm very difficult to handle

10:03.003 --> 10:04.972
if I don't get my Crunchies.

10:04.972 --> 10:05.973
Well, what if I told you

10:05.973 --> 10:07.307
that cereal was invented by

10:07.307 --> 10:08.976
sex-hating religious zealots?

10:08.976 --> 10:10.210
Jeez, man, my kid's here.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.645
Oh, never too young to learn.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.646
Breakfast cereal as we know it

10:12.646 --> 10:13.847
was invented by a man named

10:13.847 --> 10:14.982
John Harvey Kellogg,

10:14.982 --> 10:15.649
and if you saw

10:15.649 --> 10:16.549
our sex episode...

10:16.549 --> 10:17.317
He didn't.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.318
You'll remember that he was

10:18.318 --> 10:19.987
a real weirdo.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.155
Masturbation causes insanity,

10:22.155 --> 10:24.191
and circumcision is the cure.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.158
Gah!

10:25.158 --> 10:26.359
The other cure, a delicious

10:26.359 --> 10:28.662
bowl of Dr. Kellogg's granula.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.997
It preserves your sperm

10:29.997 --> 10:31.198
for strength.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.165
Why does he think those two

10:32.165 --> 10:33.000
things are related?

10:33.000 --> 10:33.734
Well, he was following

10:33.734 --> 10:35.068
the teachings of an evangelical

10:35.068 --> 10:36.837
minister named Sylvester Graham,

10:36.837 --> 10:37.504
who believed that sugar

10:37.504 --> 10:39.673
and spice were tools of Satan.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.174
Spicy rich foods lead

10:41.174 --> 10:42.575
to impure thoughts

10:42.575 --> 10:44.377
and sinful deeds!

10:44.377 --> 10:45.178
They inspire thoughts of

10:45.178 --> 10:47.014
sex and the devil.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.717
A sexy devil, like Elvira!

10:49.717 --> 10:52.352
To remain sane and pure,

10:52.352 --> 10:54.688
eat my newest creation,

10:54.688 --> 10:56.890
the graham cracker!

10:56.890 --> 10:58.525
Ooh, I love graham crackers.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.192
You might not like

10:59.192 --> 11:01.061
this one, though.

11:01.061 --> 11:01.862
Is that a snack

11:01.862 --> 11:02.595
or a punishment?

11:02.595 --> 11:03.596
Yeah, the original foods

11:03.596 --> 11:04.431
these guys invented were

11:04.431 --> 11:05.866
practically inedible,

11:05.866 --> 11:07.200
and that was that point.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.236
Eating hard flaked wheat lets

11:09.236 --> 11:11.038
God know you hate pleasure.

11:11.038 --> 11:11.872
It's what you deserve,

11:11.872 --> 11:14.207
you sexy sinner!

11:14.207 --> 11:15.542
Despite their weird ideas,

11:15.542 --> 11:16.744
Kellogg's cereal and graham

11:16.744 --> 11:17.711
crackers were actually a lot

11:17.711 --> 11:18.712
healthier than what most people

11:18.712 --> 11:19.747
ate back then,

11:19.747 --> 11:20.948
but a century later, we filled

11:20.948 --> 11:23.550
them both with sugar.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.251
Sugar?

11:24.251 --> 11:26.253
Mm-hmm.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.855
Sugar!

11:29.556 --> 11:30.423
If you gave a bowl of today's

11:30.423 --> 11:32.259
cereal to Kellogg or Graham,

11:32.259 --> 11:34.394
they would be horrified.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.395
Blasphemy!

11:35.395 --> 11:36.563
These will inspire

11:36.563 --> 11:38.065
lustful thoughts.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.133
They smell so sweet and sugary.

11:40.133 --> 11:40.901
The scent goes straight

11:40.901 --> 11:42.135
to my member!

11:42.135 --> 11:43.070
Guys, it doesn't really

11:43.070 --> 11:45.438
work that way.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.473
You make your own truth,

11:46.473 --> 11:47.374
I guess.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.113
Okay, so what should we eat

11:53.113 --> 11:54.081
for breakfast, then?

11:54.081 --> 11:55.082
Oh, well, I eat oatmeal

11:55.082 --> 11:56.416
with soy sauce on it.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.084
What?

11:57.084 --> 11:57.818
It's good.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.419
Look, eat whatever you like.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.921
Just forget all this marketing

12:00.921 --> 12:01.621
and think outside

12:01.621 --> 12:02.923
the cereal box.

12:02.923 --> 12:03.590
Wow, we've learned

12:03.590 --> 12:04.324
a lot today.

12:04.324 --> 12:04.992
But we better

12:04.992 --> 12:05.793
get back to my show.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.459
This commercial break

12:06.459 --> 12:08.495
has taken forever.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.262
Well, wait.

12:09.262 --> 12:09.930
What happens to us?

12:09.930 --> 12:10.663
Oh, you're not real.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.932
You're just a commercial family.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.100
Bye!

12:13.100 --> 12:14.334
No.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.805
No, I work at... Office?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.808
Mommy?

12:20.808 --> 12:22.009
Honey Toasted Crunchies.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.277
Part of an unbalanced breakfast.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.779
And we're back.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.446
We have to go back

12:26.446 --> 12:29.449
to break already?

12:29.449 --> 12:30.951
Well, stay tuned, 'cause when we

12:30.951 --> 12:31.952
come back, I'll be telling you

12:31.952 --> 12:32.953
how eating chocolate can

12:32.953 --> 12:34.321
actually help you lose weight.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.122
And I'll be explaining how

12:35.122 --> 12:36.656
medical shows like this one end

12:36.656 --> 12:37.858
up telling you big fat

12:37.858 --> 12:38.792
lies like that.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.360
Why is nobody stopping this?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.128
I locked the doors

12:41.128 --> 12:41.795
from the outside.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.595
No one can get in.

12:51.204 --> 12:51.872
Sorry about all

12:51.872 --> 12:52.973
the unexpected interruptions

12:52.973 --> 12:55.375
earlier, but now, I'm gonna tell

12:55.375 --> 12:57.310
you about a remarkable new diet

12:57.310 --> 12:59.346
tip, and this one really works.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.547
Are you sure about that?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
You have a "remarkable new diet

13:02.315 --> 13:03.483
tip that really works"

13:03.483 --> 13:04.852
on every show.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.685
Uh, yeah.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.487
There was a scientific study

13:07.487 --> 13:08.856
done on it, so I'm pretty sure

13:08.856 --> 13:09.823
I know what I'm talking about.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.658
Plus, I have a TV show.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.725
Yeah, just because you have

13:12.725 --> 13:13.827
a TV show doesn't mean

13:13.827 --> 13:14.828
you can't be wrong.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.496
Heck, my show is fact-checked

13:16.496 --> 13:17.497
and I could be wrong.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.331
That's why I put my sources

13:18.331 --> 13:19.399
on screen, so that people

13:19.399 --> 13:20.367
can check my work.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.034
Do you do that?

13:21.034 --> 13:21.835
No, but I just know

13:21.835 --> 13:22.735
I'm right about this one.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.570
Okay.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.838
My next guest discovered that

13:24.838 --> 13:26.073
adding chocolate to your diet

13:26.073 --> 13:26.840
can actually help you

13:26.840 --> 13:27.841
lose weight.

13:27.841 --> 13:28.675
I knew it.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.310
Please welcome John Bohannon.

13:33.080 --> 13:33.914
This man is a fraud.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.681
Adam, no he's not,

13:34.681 --> 13:35.348
he's my guest.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.183
I'm sorry, John.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.350
No, no, I am a fraud man.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.886
I purposefully did a fraudulent

13:38.886 --> 13:40.520
study about the health benefits

13:40.520 --> 13:41.521
of chocolate and I convinced

13:41.521 --> 13:42.856
the media that eating chocolate

13:42.856 --> 13:43.857
helps you lose weight.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.192
Why would you do that?

13:45.192 --> 13:46.193
Because nutritious science

13:46.193 --> 13:48.361
is totally broken and I wanted

13:48.361 --> 13:49.596
to show that it's actually very

13:49.596 --> 13:51.564
easy to fool the media into

13:51.564 --> 13:52.866
making those big headlines that

13:52.866 --> 13:54.201
cause those crazy diet fads

13:54.201 --> 13:55.268
in the first place.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.236
God, I love your work.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.939
Likewise.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.739
Which brings us to our next

13:59.739 --> 14:01.408
segment, Cooking Up a Fraudulent

14:01.408 --> 14:02.842
Study With Chefs Adam and John.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.415
So, John, tell us.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.116
How do you bake

14:09.116 --> 14:10.250
this terrible cake?

14:10.250 --> 14:10.918
It's a recipe

14:10.918 --> 14:11.885
with four steps.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.752
First, you have to take a

14:12.752 --> 14:14.054
really skewed sample rather

14:14.054 --> 14:15.388
than a properly balanced one.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.389
Okay, so I'll take a little

14:16.389 --> 14:17.290
bit of this, and this,

14:17.290 --> 14:18.926
and some of these.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.060
And ooh, this wouldn't make

14:20.060 --> 14:20.727
any sense in here.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.394
Yeah.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.896
Next, you need to cherry-pick

14:22.896 --> 14:24.431
your data, taking the stuff that

14:24.431 --> 14:25.398
supports what you're interested

14:25.398 --> 14:26.633
in and throwing out the rest.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.567
Okay, so, like, this one

14:27.567 --> 14:29.302
supports my claims and this one.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.570
And this one here.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.238
But the rest of these,

14:31.238 --> 14:32.605
I can just throw away.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.641
Wow, that's so easy!

14:34.641 --> 14:35.475
Third, you need to get it

14:35.475 --> 14:36.977
published in a shady journal

14:36.977 --> 14:38.411
with no academic standards.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.079
Oh, we have one

14:39.079 --> 14:39.746
right over here.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.747
But it has to have a sciencey

14:40.747 --> 14:42.082
name, like, the International

14:42.082 --> 14:43.083
Archives of Medicine.

14:43.083 --> 14:43.816
What's great about journals

14:43.816 --> 14:44.651
like this is they'll take

14:44.651 --> 14:45.919
any garbage you give 'em.

14:45.919 --> 14:46.619
Don't the science journals

14:46.619 --> 14:47.287
have to make sure that

14:47.287 --> 14:48.455
the papers are actually,

14:48.455 --> 14:50.423
like, scientific?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.092
Well, for most journals, yes,

14:52.092 --> 14:53.260
but there are journals that are

14:53.260 --> 14:54.294
just out to make a buck and

14:54.294 --> 14:55.462
they'll publish anything you

14:55.462 --> 14:56.763
send them as long as you pay up.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.598
Before the show, we did get a

14:58.598 --> 14:59.799
paper published.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.768
Oh, look at this.

15:01.768 --> 15:02.936
Look at how beautiful this is.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.437
It's called "The Possible

15:04.437 --> 15:05.605
Irritating Effects of

15:05.605 --> 15:07.140
Nutritional Facts" and it was

15:07.140 --> 15:08.441
published in Advances in

15:08.441 --> 15:10.110
Nutrition and Food Technology.

15:10.110 --> 15:10.777
What's in it?

15:10.777 --> 15:11.611
Oh, nothing.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.279
It's just the script

15:12.279 --> 15:13.280
to this episode.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.281
It's not even a scientific

15:14.281 --> 15:15.615
paper, but because we paid the

15:15.615 --> 15:17.517
journal $369, they published it

15:17.517 --> 15:19.619
verbatim and now we can cite it

15:19.619 --> 15:20.853
like any other source.

15:20.853 --> 15:21.989
Isn't that fun?

15:21.989 --> 15:22.956
Look at that.

15:22.956 --> 15:23.991
A script of the episode?

15:23.991 --> 15:24.958
Am I on acid?

15:24.958 --> 15:25.959
No, you're on TV.

15:25.959 --> 15:26.626
(ding)

15:26.626 --> 15:28.695
Oh, it's ready.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.630
Oh, my, John.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.166
Look at this, this is beautiful.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.501
Look at how deliciously

15:34.501 --> 15:36.536
unscientific that is.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.837
You know, but it does still seem

15:37.837 --> 15:39.206
like it's missing something.

15:39.206 --> 15:39.973
That's right.

15:39.973 --> 15:40.807
Because that brings us

15:40.807 --> 15:41.641
to the fourth step.

15:41.641 --> 15:42.642
You need to put out a press

15:42.642 --> 15:43.977
release with exaggerated

15:43.977 --> 15:44.978
language to tantalize

15:44.978 --> 15:45.712
the journalists.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.048
Who could resist this?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.550
So sugary and delicious.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.484
Voila.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.352
You've got a piping hot

15:52.352 --> 15:54.321
pan of garbage.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.023
Ooh, a delicious new study.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.657
Ooh, so sharable.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.891
Yes, please.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.393
Oh, that is disgusting.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.328
Reporters are hungry for

16:01.328 --> 16:02.862
content and they're more than

16:02.862 --> 16:04.331
willing to gobble up even faulty

16:04.331 --> 16:05.732
science, and in the case of my

16:05.732 --> 16:07.234
study, which had totally

16:07.234 --> 16:08.501
unfounded claims, they covered

16:08.501 --> 16:09.569
it all over the world.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.503
And this pattern is repeated

16:10.503 --> 16:12.072
in the media every day.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.840
Press-hungry researchers get bad

16:13.840 --> 16:14.707
science published in

16:14.707 --> 16:16.509
disreputable journals and shows

16:16.509 --> 16:17.677
like yours peddle it

16:17.677 --> 16:19.346
to people like these.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.847
But the fact is, most of the

16:20.847 --> 16:22.349
nutrition science reported on in

16:22.349 --> 16:24.384
the media isn't science at all.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.189
My God.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.523
Ancient melons?

16:30.523 --> 16:31.691
Ph balance water?

16:31.691 --> 16:34.227
Acai berries?

16:34.227 --> 16:36.196
None of it's real?

16:36.196 --> 16:36.929
None of it.

16:36.929 --> 16:37.930
You lied to us,

16:37.930 --> 16:39.032
Dr. Todd!

16:39.032 --> 16:41.201
You told us to try oil pulling!

16:41.201 --> 16:42.202
I have been eating green

16:42.202 --> 16:43.536
coffee beans for a year

16:43.536 --> 16:44.704
because of you.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.406
I haven't slept in weeks!

16:46.406 --> 16:47.907
Are your abs even real?

16:47.907 --> 16:49.542
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.443
Come on.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.578
Adam, man.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.380
Just tell them the surprising

16:53.380 --> 16:54.581
new fact about how it isn't

16:54.581 --> 16:56.549
really my fault!

16:56.549 --> 16:58.051
Sorry, it is.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.552
Shows like yours give bad

16:59.552 --> 17:01.721
medical advice, mislead people

17:01.721 --> 17:02.889
and convince them of dangerous

17:02.889 --> 17:05.392
pseudo science just to sell ads.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.259
That's not just being

17:06.259 --> 17:07.560
a bad doctor.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.129
That's being a bad person.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.297
Let's burn this place

17:10.297 --> 17:10.963
to the ground!

17:10.963 --> 17:11.631
Yeah!

17:11.631 --> 17:13.066
Oh, that was too convincing.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.201
I do not know my own strength.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.071
No, everyone, stop!

17:18.071 --> 17:18.738
There's an answer

17:18.738 --> 17:19.572
to all of this!

17:19.572 --> 17:20.573
And I'll tell you about it

17:20.573 --> 17:22.742
in just a...

17:22.742 --> 17:23.576
Uh-oh.

17:27.147 --> 17:27.980
Why did we do

17:27.980 --> 17:29.482
a pitchfork giveaway?

17:29.482 --> 17:30.483
I'm gonna lose my show and have

17:30.483 --> 17:31.584
to go back to stripping!

17:31.584 --> 17:33.753
Everybody, calm down!

17:33.753 --> 17:34.421
No!

17:34.421 --> 17:35.422
Not until Dr. Todd

17:35.422 --> 17:36.989
tells us the truth!

17:36.989 --> 17:37.790
You have to tell me

17:37.790 --> 17:38.491
what to eat!

17:38.491 --> 17:39.592
How am I supposed to know

17:39.592 --> 17:40.493
what to eat?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.129
I don't know!

17:42.129 --> 17:43.463
I'm a fraud!

17:43.463 --> 17:44.764
Guys, you just have

17:44.764 --> 17:47.467
to use common sense.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.935
Instead of listening to the TV

17:48.935 --> 17:50.970
or advertisers, listen to your

17:50.970 --> 17:53.440
doctor, your real doctor.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.141
Debbie.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.475
It's Debbie, right?

17:55.475 --> 17:56.609
Yeah.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.610
Before you started watching

17:57.610 --> 17:58.945
this show, didn't you have

17:58.945 --> 18:00.347
your own doctor who gave you

18:00.347 --> 18:01.781
informed advice?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.450
Oh, yeah.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.352
Dr. Thompson.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.486
He had, like, a regular face

18:06.486 --> 18:10.457
and no TV show, but I liked him.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.324
I miss him.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.459
I miss you too, Debbie.

18:17.997 --> 18:21.000
Dr. Thompson?

18:21.000 --> 18:21.668
I'd like to do

18:21.668 --> 18:23.170
some blood work.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.871
And if you'd let me,

18:24.871 --> 18:25.838
listen to your heart.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.643
You had me at blood work.

18:36.149 --> 18:36.883
I think they're gonna be

18:36.883 --> 18:38.518
really healthy together.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.719
And on top of that, each of us

18:39.719 --> 18:41.321
already has the best tool

18:41.321 --> 18:43.055
available for tracking health.

18:43.055 --> 18:43.823
FitBit?

18:43.823 --> 18:44.724
An Apple Watch?

18:44.724 --> 18:46.659
Whatever it is, I will buy it.

18:46.659 --> 18:47.494
No, I'm talking about

18:47.494 --> 18:48.495
your body.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.662
Please welcome our last guest,

18:49.662 --> 18:50.630
your body!

18:53.333 --> 18:54.033
Oh!

18:54.033 --> 18:55.502
No, this is a nightmare!

18:55.502 --> 18:56.503
No.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.037
A great first step in being

18:58.037 --> 18:59.206
healthy is to listen

18:59.206 --> 19:00.373
to your body.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.374
When you eat something bad,

19:01.374 --> 19:02.041
you'll know,

19:02.041 --> 19:03.176
'cause you'll feel bad.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.076
When you eat something good

19:04.076 --> 19:06.045
and exercise, you'll feel good.

19:06.045 --> 19:06.913
All you have to do is pay

19:06.913 --> 19:07.714
attention to what

19:07.714 --> 19:09.516
your body says.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.850
I like grapes!

19:10.850 --> 19:11.518
See?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.185
You just learned

19:12.185 --> 19:13.186
you like grapes.

19:13.186 --> 19:13.886
Make it stop.

19:13.886 --> 19:14.554
Oh, come on.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.422
Love your body!

19:15.422 --> 19:16.889
No!

19:16.889 --> 19:17.857
Sorry, body.

19:17.857 --> 19:18.991
I guess he's not ready.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.563
How are you doing this?

19:23.563 --> 19:24.364
Low budget green screen,

19:24.364 --> 19:25.398
I think?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.733
Look, you don't have

19:26.733 --> 19:27.867
to eat perfectly.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.035
Lord knows I don't.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.870
Just eat in moderation,

19:30.870 --> 19:32.539
healthy food whenever you can

19:32.539 --> 19:33.873
and get some exercise.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.408
That's all you need.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.210
That makes sense, but how am

19:37.210 --> 19:38.878
I supposed to make a show

19:38.878 --> 19:40.580
of that every day?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.248
I don't know.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.114
Oprah added a book club,

19:42.114 --> 19:43.015
you'll think of something.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.055
You're right.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.790
I got into this 'cause I wanted

19:50.790 --> 19:53.393
to help people, not just have

19:53.393 --> 19:55.061
my own line of teeth whitening

19:55.061 --> 19:59.065
strips, and I did it because

19:59.065 --> 20:01.401
I loved medicine.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.101
I guess I just got lost

20:02.101 --> 20:04.604
somewhere along the way.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.407
You know...

20:07.407 --> 20:10.243
my name's not even Todd.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.279
It's Rodney.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.280
Rod Bodd?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.414
Yeah.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.415
It wasn't catchy enough

20:15.415 --> 20:16.383
for television.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.619
I'm gonna do it, Adam.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.421
I'm gonna do a show based

20:21.421 --> 20:23.590
on real medical science,

20:23.590 --> 20:25.258
not puffery or flimflam.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.429
That sounds great, Rod.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.297
I'm sure it'll be a big hit.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.470
(crow cawing)

20:37.470 --> 20:38.305
(meowing)

20:42.975 --> 20:43.643
Oh.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.444
Hey, are you wearing those

20:44.444 --> 20:45.478
Shape Up shoes?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.113
Yeah, toning my butt.

20:47.113 --> 20:47.814
You know they don't

20:47.814 --> 20:48.681
work at all.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.616
Sketchers was actually hit with

20:49.616 --> 20:50.817
a class-action lawsuit

20:50.817 --> 20:51.618
over them.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.485
They ended up shelling out

20:52.485 --> 20:54.787
over $40 million.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.822
Wait, all these do is make me

20:55.822 --> 20:56.989
look weird?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.325
That's bull (bleep)!

20:58.325 --> 20:59.326
Oh, with all due respect,

20:59.326 --> 21:00.827
you also don't have a head, so.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.296
Well, what are you saying?

21:03.296 --> 21:03.996
Nothing.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.798
Forget it.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.633
Jeez.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.334
You really gotta watch what you

21:07.334 --> 21:08.435
say around this guy.
