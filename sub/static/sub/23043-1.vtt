- No, Samuel, not today.
- Please?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.516
That's $47.50.

03:47.394 --> 03:51.064
Maynard, I know our tab is pretty high,
but is there any way that we could...?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.000
Oh, yeah, of course.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.628
I'm sorry, it's just... as
soon as Bill finds a job...

03:55.652 --> 03:57.630
It's not a problem. I'll
just write it down.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.090
- You sure?
- Yeah.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.868
It's just with the darn mill closing
and it being the holidays and all.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.120
I understand. It's
tough on everybody.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.850
Thank you so much.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.208
Don't worry about it.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.005
Hey, Sam.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.007
Here you go, buddy.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.260
- Thanks, Maynard.
- You bet ya.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.179
Thank you.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.563
You're a good man, May.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.649
What are you gonna do? The
kid wanted a candy bar.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.651
You know what I'm talking about.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.112
Any coffee back there?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.406
Two coffees coming up.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.759
Old cedar and fresh flowers.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.928
Never get tired of
the smell in here.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
Afternoon, Bart. What you got?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.117
I got elk steaks.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.202
I got squab.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.436
I got... wild boar.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.440
- Is there anything you can't catch?
- Yeah, a break.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.376
You interested?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.253
You know, Connie loves
these elk steaks.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.255
She'd kill me if I didn't
bring something home.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.739
I was kind of counting on that.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.133
Hi, Parker.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.408
Hello, Bart.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.620
Here you go.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.707
You still making that stuff?
Moonshine will drive you crazy.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.793
The way I look at it,

05:35.418 --> 05:38.981
we live on this tiny little rock that's
flying through the blackness of space

05:39.005 --> 05:40.900
at about, what,
60,000 miles an hour?

05:40.924 --> 05:43.069
And there's only one
damn way to get off it.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.854
If that thought don't make you crazy,
I don't know what the hell will.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.493
I guess you're right. Never
thought of it that way.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.621
That's because you spend most of your
time stuck standing behind this counter.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.958
You need to get out, Maynard,
and breathe some life.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.126
I suppose I do. I suppose I do.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.003
It all goes by in a flash, pal.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.698
I mean, trust me, one day you'll wake up
and go, "Where the hell did it all go?"

06:06.908 --> 06:08.869
For the next time you
wanna get a little crazy.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.205
All right. Thanks.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.916
- So, just the elk steaks?
- That'll do it.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.312
Tell that pretty little wife of
yours she has excellent taste.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.438
Will do.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.715
Old cedar and fresh
flowers, I love it.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.717
Love it!

06:32.767 --> 06:35.061
Hey, Park, you mind
doing me a favor?

06:35.437 --> 06:36.605
Of course. What's up?

06:37.022 --> 06:39.357
You mind closing up tonight,
running to the bank?

06:40.191 --> 06:41.860
What happened, your
house on fire?

06:42.235 --> 06:45.488
I just wanna surprise
Connie, you know?

06:46.781 --> 06:48.325
Go home, grill up these steaks.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.452
A nice bottle of wine.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.912
Some flowers.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.623
Breathe a little life.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.291
Sweet, Maynard.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.043
Yeah, I'll close up.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.628
All right.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.047
Great.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.299
Great.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.465
Now don't have a heart attack, but I
decided to cut out a little early.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.426
Wanted to spend a nice,
romantic evening with you.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.890
I hope you're hungry, 'cause I got a
little something special planned for us.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
Connie, you here?

08:01.398 --> 08:02.398
No way.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.234
Did she get a puppy?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.619
Maynard?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.579
Connie? What's going on?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.540
What are you doing here?

08:20.542 --> 08:21.894
In my home?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.211
No, I mean now.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.672
I wanted to surprise you.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.111
You know, I'm just
gonna take off.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.261
Jack?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.155
- Is that...? What's going on?
- I can explain this.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.350
You can explain why you're
dressed up like a rabbit

08:37.517 --> 08:39.184
and having sex with a squirrel?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.455
- I'm a wolf.
- We don't have sex.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.879
That's right. According to the
club, you can't even have sex.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.754
- Club? What club is this?
- Well, it's the kind of club where...

08:48.778 --> 08:51.215
You-dress-up-like-a-squirrel-
and-have-sex-my-wife club?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.532
I'm a wolf.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.427
How many people are in the club?

08:54.451 --> 08:58.413
Well, in the tri-county area we got...
what is it, 32?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.892
Look, I've been meaning to
talk to you for a while.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.918
A while? How long has
this been going on?

09:04.085 --> 09:08.024
That's not important, Maynard. What
is important is that I'm bored.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.235
Get a hobby! Learn
to knit, do macramé.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.529
- Are you kidding me?
- We don't do anything!

09:13.553 --> 09:16.907
We don't go anywhere! I need
some excitement in my life!

09:16.931 --> 09:20.119
So instead of talking to me about
it, somewhere in your brain,

09:20.143 --> 09:21.895
the thing that makes
sense, is to go out

09:22.228 --> 09:24.022
and have sex with a squirrel?

09:24.189 --> 09:25.273
I'm a wolf!

09:27.692 --> 09:30.921
Get it? It doesn't make
any sense as a squirrel!

09:30.945 --> 09:32.048
It's gotta be a wolf!

09:32.072 --> 09:33.674
Jack, we have been
friends forever.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.699
I know.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.972
That's why I'm gonna need
to ask a favor of you.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.348
Sure thing, whatever
you need, buddy.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.208
You know, I'm kind of a
big deal in this town

09:43.333 --> 09:46.419
and don't think it'd be good
if people knew I was a furry.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.379
What's a furry?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.382
Furry. It's this
club we belong to.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.779
Well, don't 32 other
people already know?

09:54.803 --> 09:57.722
Seriously, Maynard, okay? I'm
gonna need your word on this.

10:02.185 --> 10:05.185
I think we need to take some time apart
and think about what we really want.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.739
Maynard! Maynard! You're gonna
have to keep a tight lip on this.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.909
I'm kind of a big
deal around here.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.747
- Well, I am.
- I know.

You're still here.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.951
I was just about to
call it a night.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.996
That's why you're the best.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.747
Are you drunk?

11:06.166 --> 11:11.004
First time since my wedding night,
and we all know how that turned out.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.464
I don't understand.
What happened?

11:15.341 --> 11:16.342
Well...

11:17.677 --> 11:19.888
I went out to breathe
some life...

11:20.680 --> 11:23.850
and then life decided to
take a poop on my face.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.937
So, I ended up breathing
poop instead.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.857
Rabbit and squirrel
poop, to be precise.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.276
What? Maynard, you're
not making any sense.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.006
You're right! Because
he wasn't a squirrel.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.699
He was a wolf! He's a wolf.

11:44.245 --> 11:48.166
Doesn't work if he's a squirrel.
It only works if he's a wolf.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.187
Sorry for the confusion.
It was a wolf.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.730
Let's make you some coffee.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.382
- No, I want my moonshine.
- Okay.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.176
Bart gave me this.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.954
This stuff is making me crazy.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.023
- No argument here.
- It's okay, Parker.

12:12.148 --> 12:17.779
'Cause you gotta get crazy sometime,
because of the speeding little rock.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.955
- You want some?
- No, I think I'm good.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.290
Let's get you home.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.711
I don't have a home.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.859
Of course you do and Connie's
gonna be worried sick.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.134
There's no Connie.

12:42.345 --> 12:46.516
She's been replaced by the
Easter Bunny's evil twin.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.271
She left me.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.021
What?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.442
Yeah.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.363
Oh, Maynard.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.367
I'm so sorry.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.746
Is there anything that...?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.332
Is there anything that I can...?

13:14.419 --> 13:15.586
No.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.047
I just wanna sit here.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.259
Let me take you
back to my place.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.511
It's fine.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.306
It's fine.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.142
I just wanna be here alone...

13:30.184 --> 13:32.937
think about wolves,
and rocks, and stuff.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.398
You sure you don't want
me to stay with you?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.525
Let me ask you a question.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.235
This is very important.

13:39.861 --> 13:40.861
Okay.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.532
Do you belong to a
furry sex club?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.743
I think you'll be
fine by yourself.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.431
- It's important to me.
- Yeah.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.976
I don't want you to wind up
like a furry animal sex freak.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.520
I'm gonna come back first
thing in the morning, okay?

13:56.544 --> 13:59.088
And you do me a favor
and get some rest.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.716
Okay?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.236
You were right, my friend.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.449
Here's to going crazy.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.392
All right...

14:53.476 --> 14:56.437
I'll play freaky forest
animals with ya.

16:01.127 --> 16:05.840
You know what a gorilla
would do to a bunny,

16:06.507 --> 16:08.718
or a squirrel, or whatever?

16:10.470 --> 16:11.929
Eat them alive!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.791
Maynard?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.752
Oh! Maynard, you should get up!

16:43.127 --> 16:45.838
Okay? I'll just...
I'll shut the door.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.089
Bunny.

16:47.798 --> 16:48.798
Squirrels.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.134
Gorilla.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.016
What are all these
people doing here?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.161
And now, for a story on a...

16:59.185 --> 17:00.185
You gotta see this.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.814
We go out live to Stacy
Gutierrez for a special report.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.858
- Stacy.
- Thanks, John.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.069
Hi, this is Stacy Gutierrez,

17:09.487 --> 17:14.926
live in front of the once thriving,
but now abandoned, Pottersville Mill.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.304
I'm here with the
local townsfolk

17:17.328 --> 17:22.415
who claim to have witnessed what they're
calling, well, a Bigfoot sighting.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.853
So, tell me, what did you see?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.296
Well, we were all out in
the woods smoking a...

17:27.505 --> 17:28.631
You know, hanging out.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.175
When all of a sudden this
big, huge, hairy thing

17:31.592 --> 17:33.028
comes running by, screaming.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.304
We were like, "Hey,
how stoned are you?"

17:37.765 --> 17:42.645
And then we realized we all saw
it, and we were like... "cool."

17:42.979 --> 17:46.333
I was upstairs dozing off
when I heard her scream.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.503
I heard this ruckus in the
backyard and looked out the window

17:49.527 --> 17:52.488
and I saw this...
thing, chasing a bunny.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.365
I come running down the stairs,

17:54.657 --> 17:57.827
turned on the back porch
lights and there it was.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.496
We saw it. Squatch.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.433
You've lived here your
entire life, correct?

18:03.457 --> 18:05.209
Yes, ma'am, I have.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.232
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

18:07.336 --> 18:10.965
No, ma'am. Like the kid said,
it was a big, hairy thing.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.010
Sort of half man, half gorilla.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.555
You know, like them cavemen you
see in the picture books...

18:18.639 --> 18:19.974
that ain't quite evolved yet.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.370
And all that chasing the bunny
must have made him pretty thirsty,

18:23.394 --> 18:27.440
'cause he was out there in our
little boy peeing fountain drinking.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.086
I mean, literally, the little boy
was peeing right in his mouth.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.153
Then what happened?

18:32.778 --> 18:35.406
Then he just disappeared
into the darkness.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.801
- There you have it, John.
- Can you believe that?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.971
- A pretty incredible story.
- Yeah, that's something.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.747
Bigfoot, right here,
in our own backyard.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.809
I might have to come up there to try
and catch a glimpse of him myself.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.876
That sucks.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.711
You should!

18:49.211 --> 18:50.338
I'll be right back.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.048
Is everything...?

19:35.049 --> 19:37.009
Sir, I'm sorry. Can
you pick up, please?

19:38.219 --> 19:39.196
Is he here?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.555
We have a bit of an emergency
going on right now, Maynard.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.408
Trust me, he's gonna
want to hear about this.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.684
All right. Go ahead.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.769
Ma'am, can you
repeat that, please?

19:47.061 --> 19:48.604
Sure. Absolutely.

19:52.650 --> 19:57.029
Yeah, well, we could either do it here in
my office, or go out to Phoebe's Knob.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.614
Four o'clock. Thank you.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.426
I was gonna talk to
you, man, I promise,

20:01.450 --> 20:04.078
but things are nuts
around here this morning.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.412
Yeah.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.416
Maynard, I'm not having
an affair with Connie.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.936
It's just about the club.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.880
I mean, hell, that could've been anybody
from the club up in your bedroom.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.192
Thanks. I feel a lot better now.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.051
There's nothing romantic.
I'd never do that.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.345
It's just about the costumes.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.432
Speaking of costumes...

20:25.558 --> 20:26.851
Sheriff, sorry to interrupt,

20:26.976 --> 20:30.312
but there's a producer from some
television show on the phone for you.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.816
Thanks, Tammy. Look, I've
gotta take this. But...

20:34.233 --> 20:35.460
We're okay, right?

20:35.484 --> 20:38.654
Hey, I'm never gonna rub the bunny again.
I promise.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.883
- I gotta show you something.
- I gotta take this.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.909
Everybody's apeshit over
this Bigfoot business.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.245
Later, okay? We'll
talk later, all right?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.750
Hello. Yeah, this
is Sheriff Clark.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.769
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.836
Hi, how are you?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.715
Good to hear your voice as well.

20:59.175 --> 21:03.012
Well, let's see. Maybe we
can make something work...

21:12.938 --> 21:14.541
Just the man we
were looking for.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.334
We were wondering if you
could do us a favor.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.755
Now, we've been researching this whole
Bigfoot thing, and people really love him.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.654
It's true.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.241
He's been around for centuries,
and people on every continent

21:24.492 --> 21:27.995
and that speak every language, they
just can't get enough of this guy.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.790
Yeah, so we've decided to get
into the Bigfoot business.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.227
We're gonna start this
whole cottage industry...

21:34.251 --> 21:37.773
Bigfoot t-shirts, hats, bumper
stickers, baby onesies, you name it.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.175
Everything. We were just wondering if
we could sell some stuff in your store?

21:43.177 --> 21:44.177
So, what do you think?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.602
Sure, fellas. Whatever you need.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.372
Awesome.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.481
Thanks.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.174
I was wanting to talk to you about
last night. I've been thinking...

22:04.198 --> 22:06.551
I know we need to talk, Maynard,
I just can't right now.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.952
I've got something to do.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.372
- What's more important than...
- Bigfoot.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.250
Seriously? You
believe in all that?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.043
Are you kidding me?

22:16.627 --> 22:17.729
I love it.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.714
It's the most exciting thing to
happen to this town for decades.

22:32.532 --> 22:34.144
It's is the most exciting thing

22:34.270 --> 22:35.768
to happen to this
town for decades.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.815
Stuck standing
behind this counter.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.042
You need to get out, Maynard!

22:39.066 --> 22:40.794
Just the man we
were looking for.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.338
This whole Bigfoot thing,
and people really love him.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.590
Everybody's apeshit over
this Bigfoot business.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.367

in our own backyard.

If this keeps up, we're gonna
need to hire some help.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.792
It's kind of nice, isn't it? All
these new people visiting the town?

24:21.585 --> 24:22.896
Oh my God! Guys! Come quick!

24:22.920 --> 24:25.201
- What's going on?
- Come on! You're not gonna believe it!

24:35.975 --> 24:38.686
Brock!

Monsters are here!

24:43.524 --> 24:44.525
Land it here!

24:47.903 --> 24:49.154
Who's that?

24:49.655 --> 24:52.616
You've never seen his show?
Oh, it's awesome.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.952
Each week he goes
after some monster...

24:55.160 --> 24:58.163
Loch Ness, Chupacabra,
the Abominable Snowman.

24:58.664 --> 24:59.957
This dude's amazing!

25:04.086 --> 25:07.172
There's a rumor floating around that
there may be a Sasquatch in these parts.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.426
Exactly. Follow me on Twitter.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.017
For starters, let's see
a show of hands...

25:19.018 --> 25:21.645
How many of you have
actually seen the Squatch?

25:22.980 --> 25:25.941
Wow. What about you, love?
What exactly did you see?

25:26.191 --> 25:29.462
I was about to get in
my car and whoosh...

25:29.486 --> 25:30.755
he ran right in front of me.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.531
He must have been ten feet tall.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.713
- He was as big as a tree.
- Three meters.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.054
I saw him out at Grasshopper Hill, and
if Millie says he was ten feet tall,

25:38.078 --> 25:41.081
I gotta say he was even bigger. I
think he was as big as a house.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.169
Did Connie enjoy her elk?

25:46.628 --> 25:49.798
Well, she's been enjoying all
kinds of animals lately.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.765
From everything I've
heard, it sounds to me

25:58.098 --> 26:00.851
like we should start our search
at the Grasshopper Hill.

26:01.852 --> 26:04.229
If any of you would like to
join us, despite the peril,

26:04.730 --> 26:05.773
we could use your help.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.316
I could form a search party.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.860
Much obliged, sheriff. Cheers.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.153
Cheers back to you.

26:12.154 --> 26:13.465
I'm a huge fan of you.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.325
I'm gonna get you an autograph.
Remind me to get him an autograph.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.286
- Don't forget.
- Oh my God.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.414
Well, well, this is
quite a turn out.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.584
Sheriff, if you don't mind.

26:28.003 --> 26:32.216
All right folks, I want you to spread
out and form a single-file line.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.885
A single-file line, people.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.595
Now, these are not toys.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.597
Not a toy. All right?

26:38.889 --> 26:43.060
These are only to be used if you find
something or run into some evidence.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.247
And if you do, make sure
you don't touch anything.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.898
Do not touch anything.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.002
- Is there an echo out here?
- Sorry.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.152
Showtime.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.867
One for you and for
you, nice lady.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.897
What did you find?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.209
Well, I saw this, but
I didn't know if...

27:31.233 --> 27:34.236
Dang it, Jasper, it's
just a dead deer.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.133
Did I not tell you that
these were not toys?

27:38.157 --> 27:39.283
I know, but...

27:39.533 --> 27:41.577
Are you stoned, Jasper?

27:42.035 --> 27:44.204
Because I swear, I will drag
you down to the station,

27:44.329 --> 27:47.791
- and I will drug test your butt.
- He will drug test your butt.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.377
Wait, wait, look here.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.385
That is very
interesting, isn't it?

27:59.469 --> 28:01.013
Very interesting indeed.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.058
Do you see how the leg
is snapped back there?

28:07.561 --> 28:10.063
- Only a Squatch would do that.
- Or a hole.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.565
What's that, then?

28:11.899 --> 28:15.194
Probably stepped in a hole, broke
its leg and died from exposure.

28:19.072 --> 28:23.035
For your information, this
type of injury is mostly seen

28:23.368 --> 28:26.246
amongst the deer of the Mt.
Tamborine region of Queensland,

28:26.622 --> 28:28.290
caused by the Australian Yowie.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.959
I have heard of rare instances

28:31.460 --> 28:33.503
where it's been done by its
North American cousin...

28:34.671 --> 28:35.671
The Bigfoot.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.884
But I've never seen it
before with my own eyes...

28:39.593 --> 28:40.719
until right now.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.183
So, thanks for the input, mate, but...
I think I'm the expert here.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.644
Now, now.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.396
This was definitely a Squatch.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.069
Spike, we'll go one
more as a promo, yeah?

28:57.277 --> 28:59.589
- Great idea.
- Keep me in like a cowboy, yeah?

28:59.613 --> 29:00.613
You got me?

29:00.864 --> 29:01.865
Three, two...

29:06.161 --> 29:07.881
There's definitely a
Squatch in these woods.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.186
One more. I'm gonna do the spectacles
because it's kind of neat.

29:13.877 --> 29:14.920
Change up.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.254
Three, two...

29:18.423 --> 29:20.300
There's definitely a
Squatch in these woods.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.470
I didn't love that one. I'm
gonna go one more time. And...

29:25.097 --> 29:27.657
Really be with me on when "There's
a Squatch in the woods," yeah?

29:28.058 --> 29:29.101
All right.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.061
Action.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.992
There's definitely a
Squatch in these woods.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.752
- That one. Great.
- Yeah.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.319
Now where do we get a Foster's?

29:41.196 --> 29:43.240
Foster's. It's
Australian for beer.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.284
Oh, beer.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.037
So, what do you do now, Mr.
Masterson?

29:49.329 --> 29:50.789
Now we must track the beast.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.335
We must venture out at night. Alone.
That's very important.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.381
The Squatch is a primarily
nocturnal creature.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.591
It will be incredibly dangerous,

30:02.050 --> 30:07.222
but we must strive to get some film
or photographic evidence of it.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.308
So, are we actually
gonna be on TV?

30:09.599 --> 30:12.686
Unless anybody's got a problem
with this town being... famous.

30:16.690 --> 30:20.277
I'm not sure how many of you saw
my adventure into to the Himalaya

30:20.694 --> 30:22.297
to search of the Yeti?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.363
You were so brave.

30:24.072 --> 30:29.077
Do you ever dress up like the
animals you're in search of?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.413
You know, like camouflage?

30:31.872 --> 30:34.916
Can't say that I have, but
I like your thinking.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.170
Somebody get me a net, I
think I found a mermaid.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.881
She's not. She's got legs.

30:42.007 --> 30:46.070
I wrote a little song about
my quest for the Yeti,

30:46.094 --> 30:48.906
and I don't suppose you'd like me to
play for you right now, would you?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.098
No, I couldn't.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.731
This is dedicated
to Nelson Mandela.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.193
Sorry.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.029
Always chokes me up. Thank you.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.742
- Hey, I need to...
- Not now, Maynard.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.535

There's a lot more verses, but I'm
not gonna bore you with that.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.603
I couldn't possibly.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.149
I did write a poem
about the Chupacabra.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.074
Now, you all know who I am.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.535
What I do for a living.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.204
If you really wanna put
this town on the map...

32:36.705 --> 32:39.332
be world famous, flooded
with tourists...

32:39.708 --> 32:43.420
We gotta be the first to catch
this Bigfoot, or Squatch,

32:43.545 --> 32:45.398
or Yeti... whatever you call it.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.692
Well, I'll catch this bird for
you, but it won't be easy.

32:47.716 --> 32:51.386
It won't be like catching a squirrel
or a cute little bunny rabbit.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.614
And it won't be pleasant.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.099
But you all gotta make up
your minds about something.

32:56.224 --> 32:59.478
I mean, do you wanna go back to
being the same old, boring town,

32:59.811 --> 33:03.440
or be the Pottersville that
the whole world knows about?

33:04.524 --> 33:06.693
'Cause I'll find him.
I'll catch him.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.281
And it'll give you a hell of
a lot more than one TV show.

33:11.990 --> 33:16.703
Thanks Bart, we'll take
that into consideration.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.208
Think about it.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.627
Let me know.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.419
Sheriff.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.465
Mr. Singing Television Man.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.343
Ladies and gentlemen.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.730
Connie, please don't
say anything.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.942
Okay? I just need you to sit there
for a moment and listen to me.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.240
I'm Bigfoot.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.160
I know... I know it
sounds crazy, but I am.

33:57.410 --> 34:01.456
I mean, I'm not, obviously.
Really, it's just a costume.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.836
You know how you
said you loved it?

34:08.045 --> 34:10.465
And you said you needed some
excitement in your life, and...

34:10.840 --> 34:13.467
and this is the most exciting
thing to happen for years?

34:14.969 --> 34:17.389
That's why I did it.
I did it for you.

34:19.431 --> 34:21.643
I did it for all Pottersville.

34:24.145 --> 34:28.858
Now I just need to keep this thing going
long enough until they get their show.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.572
So many people have
their heart set on it.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.197
I can't let them down.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.205
I just thought you should know.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.635
- Hey, Ali?
- Yeah?

35:19.659 --> 35:22.471
Can you find out if there's a place
in town that does eyebrow threading?

35:22.495 --> 35:24.581
- Oh, yeah.
- I'd like them tweaked a little bit.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.124
Okay. Shall we? Yeah?

35:26.416 --> 35:29.177
I will bite it off if you do that again.
I'll bite the hand clean off.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.106
- Swallow it.
- Please don't touch him.

35:31.963 --> 35:32.963
Thanks.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.841
Good luck to cowboy. Yeah?

35:35.216 --> 35:36.343
- The opening?
- We're set.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.109
We'll do the whole
opening from the top.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.555
And in three, two, one.
I'm coming in hot.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.307
We get our first shot. And...

35:43.016 --> 35:47.562
Here we are out at Grasshopper
Hill, amidst the flora and fauna,

35:48.480 --> 35:51.399
where there have been numerous
reports of a Sasquatch.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.984
Well, we've all...

35:55.362 --> 35:58.031
What are you doing?

35:58.865 --> 35:59.991
I'm sorry?

36:00.742 --> 36:01.742
You're sorry?

36:02.202 --> 36:06.289
You're sorry? You're... in my eye line
when I'm doing the intro of my lifetime.

36:07.374 --> 36:11.294
Maybe the greatest intro ever and I've
got you in my eye line with this.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.922
What's that? Are you
a professional?

36:14.214 --> 36:15.340
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:17.842 --> 36:19.682
- I was...
- Why don't you use your head, mate?

36:19.803 --> 36:21.864
- What were you doing?
- I was...

36:21.888 --> 36:23.431
I was...

36:24.891 --> 36:26.811
- I was checking the light.
- Checking the light.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.897
He's checking the light.
How was it?

36:31.481 --> 36:32.481
How's the light?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.711
- 'Cause the show now is rubbish.
- I'm sorry.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.320
- He's sorry.
- It won't happen again.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.905
Sorry and it won't happen again.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.325
It will not happen again,

36:42.617 --> 36:45.537
because I'll use your butt
as Bigfoot bait, okay?

36:45.662 --> 36:47.348
- It won't happen again.
- It won't happen again.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.207
Ready? Shall we try it again?

36:49.916 --> 36:52.627
Without this idiot in my shot?
Okay. Ready?

36:52.877 --> 36:54.295
Best show ever. Here we go.

36:54.671 --> 36:58.925
First positions. Everybody knows
where they're supposed to be. Okay.

37:02.804 --> 37:06.933
I'm gonna prep it and come in hot.
Coming in hot. Okay.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.227
Three, two, one.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.272
We're out here at
Grasshopper Hill.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.418
Let's switch on
the night vision.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.194
And see if this Squatch wants
to come out and dance.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.744
There is an
interesting detail...

37:26.202 --> 37:31.624
which is that the Squatch, particularly
the North American Squatch,

37:31.791 --> 37:34.335
he's drawn to wood.

37:34.627 --> 37:39.632
And the reason being because the
wood has so much sap in it...

37:39.841 --> 37:41.676
it's got tons and tons of sap,

37:41.885 --> 37:44.512
and the Squatch
feeds on this sap,

37:45.013 --> 37:47.682
to feed its powerful libido.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.186
Let's see if we
can draw him out.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.563
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.069
Come out for sap.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.161
Did you hear the rustle?
We've got something.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.334
I think we've got something.

38:18.546 --> 38:19.839
Let's see...

38:20.673 --> 38:23.968
if we can get this Squatch
to respond to our claps.

38:25.178 --> 38:30.809
The Squatch is inclined to
mimic us, its human cousin.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.729
Let's see if it will
mimic my claps.

38:46.783 --> 38:47.951
We'll go again.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.287
Come out and dance, Squatch.
Come out and dance.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.211
We've got something.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.380
Okay. Selfie stick.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
I, Brock Masterson,

39:05.552 --> 39:08.429
here at Grasshopper
Hill, shall now attempt

39:08.888 --> 39:11.599
to communicate with the Squatch.

39:23.987 --> 39:27.156
Wilkins, okay, best work ever,
but you're way too close.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.533
Back it off a little, please.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.078
- That wasn't me.
- Okay. Very, very funny, mate.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.789
You sound great, but it's way
too close so back it off,

39:34.914 --> 39:36.916
and, like, 50 percent
of that, okay?

39:37.083 --> 39:39.711
I'm telling you that
wasn't me, I swear.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.131
Wilkins?

39:47.427 --> 39:48.427
Wilkins?

39:50.138 --> 39:51.818
I think there's something
really out here.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.599
What?

39:54.350 --> 39:57.437
I don't know, but it just ran past me
and he's heading in your direction.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.780
I don't think they
got their picture.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.656
Great. I'm all packed, we'll
get the hell out of here.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.207
You can cut the Brock
routine, it's only me.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.259
- Where's your stuff?
- I've been thinking...

40:20.418 --> 40:22.730
- I just talked to the network...
- No...

40:22.754 --> 40:25.548
I'm done with this nonsense

40:25.673 --> 40:28.193
and this ridiculous
third-rate cable TV show

40:28.217 --> 40:30.571
that, by the way, is just
barely beating the Family Feud.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.406
- Just hear me out.
- No. Ain't gonna happen, okay?

40:32.430 --> 40:35.451
Are you nuts? I'm not gonna let my ass
get eaten by Bigfoot, or Sasquatch,

40:35.475 --> 40:37.077
or whatever the hell thing
is out in the woods.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.261
- I will not let that happen.
- Did you see that thing?

40:39.896 --> 40:43.107
Obviously, I wouldn't have done
this if I thought Bigfoot was real.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.275
Calm down.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.777
This is what we do.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.529
We get that local hunter guy, you
know, with the fingernails...

40:48.696 --> 40:51.407
- Are you nuts?
- I talked to network, they love the idea.

40:52.158 --> 40:55.495
Think about it, not only
does it make a great show,

40:55.995 --> 40:57.830
but if he actually
catches Bigfoot...

40:58.456 --> 41:01.209
You mean, if I actually
catch Bigfoot.

41:01.876 --> 41:05.171
Right, if you catch Bigfoot,

41:05.838 --> 41:09.926
you will be the biggest
star in the world.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.280
- You really think so?
- Are you kidding me?

41:13.304 --> 41:15.515
It would be the greatest
moment in television history.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.798
So, I think what you mean is...

41:19.852 --> 41:21.789
it would get me off this
stupid show, right?

41:21.813 --> 41:24.208
I mean, if I catch Bigfoot,
that's our biggest episode ever.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.459
No way to top that.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.443
Perfect time to retire Brock.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.696
Blaze of glory.

41:30.488 --> 41:34.242
- Start doing movies like we talked about.
- That's what I'm saying.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.369
So what do you think?

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497
Crikey!

41:42.709 --> 41:44.979
I know. This face is such
a movie face, right?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.212
Such good face.

41:47.588 --> 41:48.588
Yeah?

41:49.048 --> 41:50.048
Bart, it's me.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.676
Who the hell is me?

41:52.135 --> 41:53.386
It's me, Bart. It's Jack.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.140
The sheriff.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.226
If you've come for my
still, you can piss off.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.437
I'm not here for
the still, Bart.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.148
Look, I got a couple of people
out here who wanna talk to you.

42:06.149 --> 42:07.692
People from the TV studio.

42:11.904 --> 42:12.904
Hi.

42:13.656 --> 42:17.160
- What do you want?
- We want you to help us catch Bigfoot.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.513
How much?

42:19.537 --> 42:21.956
We can pay you 5,000 dollars.

42:22.248 --> 42:26.669
Five thousand to go with you,
10,000 to find him and catch him.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.718
- Fine.
- And we do it my way.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.887
- Meaning what?
- We go alone.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.139
You and me alone in the woods?

42:39.057 --> 42:41.493
What about the crew? We
have a whole show to shoot.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.894
I suggest you bring your camera.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.329
Not quite that simple, mate.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.331
- We can figure it out.
- There's hair and makeup and such.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.001
We're not going to catch imps and fairies.
We're going out to catch...

42:49.025 --> 42:50.586
You know what? I'm coming with.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.050
- The hell you are.
- Actually, wait.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.238
I think... that, actually,
is a very good idea.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.282
Bart, I'm the sheriff, okay?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.487
And if we're gonna catch
Bigfoot, I'm gonna be there.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.744
It's a great idea.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.413
Alright, the three of us.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.210
We ain't opening a beauty parlor.
By the truck in ten.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.146
Go on.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.171
Ten minutes by the truck.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.672
We love your house.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.071
Couldn't be a beauty parlor
under the circumstances.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.097
I just don't understand
even the reference.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.578
Keep the change. Don't
worry about it.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.914
Gee, thanks. Enjoy your
stay in Pottersville.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.022
Let's go, boys.

43:37.824 --> 43:40.886
I suppose the next thing
you're gonna tell me

43:40.910 --> 43:42.763
is that you had
lunch with Bigfoot.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.723
Did he ask for his pants back?

43:44.747 --> 43:45.933
Are you calling me fat?

43:45.957 --> 43:49.812
- If the shoe fits...
- Ladies, what in the world?

43:49.836 --> 43:52.648
She's trying to say that she's
seen Bigfoot more than I have.

43:52.672 --> 43:56.342
But everybody knows she's just
trying to get on the show.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.718
All right, that's enough.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.638
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.727
Good Lord, what is
going on around here?

44:08.771 --> 44:09.939
Thank you.

44:10.648 --> 44:14.753
Step right up, folks, get your
brand new Bigfoot merchandise.

44:14.777 --> 44:18.257
That's right. Get it while
we still have a Bigfoot.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.281
What did you mean, "while
we still have a Bigfoot"?

44:20.575 --> 44:21.927
Because of Bart.

44:21.951 --> 44:24.263
- What about him?
- You didn't hear?

44:24.287 --> 44:26.038
They're putting him
on Monster Finder.

44:26.706 --> 44:27.706
What?

44:28.416 --> 44:31.103
You know Bart, if anybody can
catch Bigfoot, it's him.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.587
- Let's get these unpacked.
- Okay.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.547
You got it.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.428
Guns, huh?

44:42.471 --> 44:45.808
How the hell did you think we were gonna
catch him, with a big butterfly net?

44:46.642 --> 44:49.020
Oh, yeah. We can't
kill it, right?

44:49.520 --> 44:50.980
Just tranq' guns, Brock.

44:51.314 --> 44:52.607
Make him go beddie-byes.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.734
Right, tranq' guns.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.754
- Tranq' guns, Eileen, I knew that.
- What?

44:57.778 --> 44:59.882
I was testing you guys. Of
course they are tranq' guns.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.909
Sheriff, would you be a doll?
I got a bit of a Yoga injury.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.996
I got a Yoga injury. Thank you.

45:08.456 --> 45:09.457
Thanks, lovely.

45:11.792 --> 45:15.480
I wish they'd find whoever's doing
it and just be done with it already.

45:15.504 --> 45:16.547
Doing what?

45:16.672 --> 45:17.965
Pretending to be Bigfoot.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.552
How do you know it's
someone pretending?

45:23.095 --> 45:25.264
Because there's no such
thing as a Bigfoot.

45:26.057 --> 45:27.058
Hmm.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.456
What's all that crap?

45:32.480 --> 45:34.357
Just a few essentials.
Some night vision.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.359
Helmet cam, light meter.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.004
Pheromone spectrometer
which is my own design.

45:39.028 --> 45:42.198
It reads the pheromones
of beasts or monsters.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.116
You're so great, why
do you need me?

45:45.326 --> 45:47.703
- Jack, pick up that tent, would you?
- Tent?

45:49.163 --> 45:50.748
Are we spending the night?

45:51.040 --> 45:53.060
What did you think, we were
going for a couple hours,

45:53.084 --> 45:55.795
be back in time for you to
watch Dancing with the Stars?

45:56.170 --> 45:58.381
This is a hunt, not
a day at the spa.

45:58.798 --> 46:01.193
How long are we
planning on staying?

46:01.217 --> 46:02.593
Until we catch him!

46:03.052 --> 46:07.848
Okay, Mr. Singing Dancing Television
Man, times-a-wasting. Get in the car.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.643
What? You'll be fine.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.562
- You'll be fine.
- Oh, my God.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.107
I'll try and bring him
back in one piece.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.279
Give me a break.

46:21.696 --> 46:24.240
I bet a dollar to a dime that

46:24.699 --> 46:27.994
it's just some prankster out there
having a big laugh at our expense.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.830
But if it's a hoax, I don't
think he's trying to be mean.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.915
Look at how happy
he's made everybody.

46:33.666 --> 46:35.751
At first, but the whole
town has changed.

46:35.918 --> 46:38.713
Now everyone is dying to get
on that stupid TV show.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.508
I think they're just looking for
something that gives them a little hope.

46:46.470 --> 46:51.851
So, if it's not really a Bigfoot,
if it's just some guy pretending,

46:51.976 --> 46:54.096
what do you think they'll do
to him if they catch him?

46:55.479 --> 46:58.482
Hell, knowing Bart, probably shoot
him and hang his head on the wall.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.032
I'll get him.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.787
I'm just outside
of Pottersville,

47:12.038 --> 47:14.957
where it is nine o'clock
in the post meridian.

47:15.374 --> 47:19.503
And, ladies and gentlemen, for the
first time in Monster Finder history,

47:20.087 --> 47:25.718
this find has proven to be so treacherous
that I am out here completely alone.

47:26.135 --> 47:30.782
Aided only by the sheriff,
for legal reasons,

47:30.806 --> 47:32.767
and a local guide...

47:34.101 --> 47:35.412
who is quite curmudgeonly.

47:35.436 --> 47:36.854
What the hell is he doing?

47:39.065 --> 47:40.649
I think he's filming
his TV show.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.860
Is that thing gonna
be on the whole time?

47:43.027 --> 47:46.781
Guys, please. I'm filming my show. That
means I've gotta capture everything.

47:47.448 --> 47:48.574
Sorry.

47:49.950 --> 47:50.951
Can we watch?

47:51.077 --> 47:54.330
Yes. In fact, I think you should
watch, so you can get ready.

47:54.538 --> 47:55.706
For what?

47:56.207 --> 47:59.418
For the Bigfoot, mate.
For the Bigfoot.

48:00.336 --> 48:06.550
Now, I shall try to
communicate with the beast.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.475
You having bowel problems?

48:15.184 --> 48:16.936
I'm communicating
with the Squatch.

48:17.478 --> 48:18.562
By yodeling?

48:19.188 --> 48:22.483
- It's a mating call.
- Oh. So you wanna hump Bigfoot?

48:24.819 --> 48:25.945
It's a coyote.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.072
That's his way of
communicating with us.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.508
It's a coyote.

48:29.532 --> 48:30.699
Very specifically...

48:31.200 --> 48:36.038
there's a Squatch
pretending to be a coyote.

48:36.664 --> 48:37.664
It just gets wilder.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.333
That's what the Squatch does.

48:41.085 --> 48:42.085
See.

48:42.545 --> 48:44.046
Definitely a coyote.

48:44.213 --> 48:45.214
Okay, fine.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.568
- That's for sure. It's a coyote.
- Definitely a coyote.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.845
Fine...

48:51.971 --> 48:53.264
Get out a secret weapon.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.182
Secret weapon.

48:56.392 --> 48:59.061
You gonna write another one
of them Yeti love songs?

49:01.230 --> 49:04.859
A secret weapon against the Squatch...
is our humanity.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.989
So we shall try to lure him
in with the gift of melody.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.885
Maybe we're gonna have one of them...
Bigfoot hoe-downs.

49:13.909 --> 49:15.453
I hope you got some
more moonshine.

49:30.426 --> 49:32.404
- What?
- You're gonna wake the whole county.

49:32.428 --> 49:35.323
- You think it's stupid, don't you?
- No, I don't think you're stupid.

49:35.347 --> 49:38.893
I just think maybe sometimes when it
comes to thinking, you have bad luck.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.985
I don't understand why it's not working.
It worked perfectly last time.

49:53.032 --> 49:56.136
I hear you, brother, but I've laid bait
and tripwire around the perimeter,

49:56.160 --> 49:57.745
so we'll know when he's coming.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.101
Bait and tripwire. Is that safe?

50:12.134 --> 50:13.134
You okay?

50:14.178 --> 50:15.387
Do you want me to do that?

50:15.888 --> 50:17.056
No, I'm fine.

50:17.932 --> 50:19.600
You can take off if you want.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.352
I'll wait till you're done.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.438
I'll get the bank bag, I can
drop it off on my way home.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.107
Great. Thanks.

51:07.398 --> 51:08.398
Thanks.

51:13.529 --> 51:14.529
What?

51:15.614 --> 51:16.907
Do you need anything else?

51:18.367 --> 51:20.244
Nope, all good.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.204
Thanks for doing it.

51:24.456 --> 51:25.708
Good night, Maynard.

51:52.401 --> 51:53.652
What the hell was that?

51:55.529 --> 51:58.949
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- If you see Bigfoot, shoot him.

52:03.704 --> 52:07.475
I've set up bait and tripwire
around the perimeter of the camp,

52:07.499 --> 52:10.586
and the tripwire has
just been tripped.

52:10.753 --> 52:14.423
So, let's see if we've
got ourselves a Squatch.

52:17.176 --> 52:18.176
What the...?

52:18.969 --> 52:21.597
I think I got him. I
think I got Bigfoot!

52:25.559 --> 52:26.559
What happened?

52:26.977 --> 52:28.354
You shot Jack.

52:32.691 --> 52:35.045
- Where's Bigfoot?
- There's no Bigfoot.

52:35.069 --> 52:39.406
It was just one of your coyotes looking for
a romantic evening of dinner and song.

52:40.032 --> 52:43.494
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He'll be all right, just taking a nap.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.454
Nobody died on this trip.

52:46.955 --> 52:47.956
Yet.

52:55.714 --> 52:57.966
'Cause I'll find
him, I'll catch him.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.049
Is there anything
you can't catch?

53:01.261 --> 53:04.139
You know Bart. If anybody can
catch Bigfoot, it's him.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.850
Probably shoot him and
hang his head on the wall.

53:21.198 --> 53:23.176
Hey, it's me. You gotta
get me out of here.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.136
Why? What's the matter?

53:25.160 --> 53:27.514
We didn't hear a peep
from Bigfoot all night.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.873
And I haven't slept
and I haven't eaten,

53:30.457 --> 53:32.977
and on top of everything else, I'm
taking a crap in the woods right now.

53:33.001 --> 53:34.962
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm pooping right now...

53:35.546 --> 53:38.215
- while I'm talking to you.
- Ew. That is so gross.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.902
What am I supposed to do? It's not
like there are bathrooms here.

53:40.926 --> 53:44.096
First of all, you could not
call me while you're doing it.

53:44.596 --> 53:48.517
Besides, what are you
doing about toilet paper?

53:51.103 --> 53:52.383
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.482
Oh, God. You gotta get
me out of this hell.

53:55.941 --> 53:58.026
I have some Purell, but I
don't think that's gonna...

53:59.528 --> 54:00.528
Hello?

54:00.571 --> 54:01.571
Hello?

54:01.780 --> 54:04.801
- No phones on my hunt.
- Great! That's just great!

54:04.825 --> 54:07.077
What do we do now if there's
an actual emergency?

54:07.286 --> 54:08.930
Relax. You're the expert.

54:08.954 --> 54:11.540
I will have you know, I
have low blood sugar

54:11.915 --> 54:13.685
and we haven't eaten since
we've been out here.

54:13.709 --> 54:14.918
I could get light-headed.

54:15.127 --> 54:16.879
You're hungry? Why
didn't you say so?

54:18.422 --> 54:19.590
Here.

54:28.515 --> 54:29.515
There.

54:38.734 --> 54:39.943
It's protein. It's okay.

54:47.659 --> 54:48.786
Are you mad?

54:49.161 --> 54:51.663
You better pick that up. Your
breakfast is getting away.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.291
I've lost my appetite.

54:55.125 --> 54:58.521
Have it your way. I just wouldn't
want you to die of light-headedness.

54:58.545 --> 54:59.755
You owe me an iPhone.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.179
- That'll be one dollar.
- A dollar?

55:07.971 --> 55:11.117
Unbelievable. Five bucks in the city. I'll
buy a bunch of these before we leave.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.368
When is that gonna be, actually?

55:12.392 --> 55:14.704
Well, if they don't find something
tonight, he's outta there.

55:14.728 --> 55:16.605
He's not gonna make it another night.
No way.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.875
And then this whole trip
will have been a bust.

55:18.899 --> 55:20.192
We got some footage.

55:20.818 --> 55:23.963
We can't air a show without
any Bigfoot evidence

55:23.987 --> 55:26.532
and him running around looking
scared out of his mind.

55:27.825 --> 55:28.885
Thank you.

55:28.909 --> 55:29.952
Let's go.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.502
Good evening, Jack.

55:38.919 --> 55:42.172
You've been sleeping all day,
and he's been sulking all day.

55:45.884 --> 55:49.388
Here you go, Jack. Come on over here.
All is forgiven.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.825
He knows you didn't
mean to shoot him.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.601
Why don't you tell us
all about Bigfoot?

55:54.726 --> 55:57.563
Who knows? It may help us to catch him.
Come on.

55:58.564 --> 56:02.484
- You have any of that moonshine left?
- If a snake had ears would you screw it?

56:14.413 --> 56:15.493
What are you doing tonight?

56:17.958 --> 56:18.958
Nothing.

56:22.921 --> 56:25.048
You wanna hang out,
have a couple of beers?

56:25.799 --> 56:27.342
I don't think I'm in the mood.

56:29.595 --> 56:33.223
Why don't you come over? We'll
watch a movie and make popcorn.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.687
I'm not up for a movie tonight.
Thanks, though.

56:39.313 --> 56:40.814
You sure? I make a
mean Jiffy Pop.

56:40.981 --> 56:42.441
I know you do, I just...

56:42.608 --> 56:44.610
It's been a long couple
of weeks, you know?

56:46.111 --> 56:47.111
Rain check?

56:49.281 --> 56:50.282
Any time.

56:55.370 --> 56:56.472
Night, May.

56:56.496 --> 56:57.496
Night, Park.

56:57.998 --> 56:58.998
Oh, hey...

57:02.920 --> 57:04.046
You mind?

57:04.546 --> 57:05.672
Of course not.

57:31.531 --> 57:35.285
Are you trying to tell me that
Bigfoot is really an alien?

57:35.452 --> 57:38.580
No. Not...

57:42.209 --> 57:45.253
Not just an alien...

57:47.172 --> 57:48.632
an alien criminal...

57:50.050 --> 57:54.471
who has been dropped and
left on this planet

57:55.222 --> 57:57.557
as punishment for his crimes.

57:57.683 --> 58:03.021
Are you trying to say that Earth
is like a prison for Bigfoot?

58:03.188 --> 58:04.064
Exactly.

58:04.189 --> 58:06.668
- It's a prison for Bigfoot.
- Exactly.

58:06.692 --> 58:08.443
It's a prison. The whole
thing is a prison.

58:09.987 --> 58:13.240
So when we catch him, Jack, you're
gonna have to read him his rights.

58:57.284 --> 59:00.328
Mr. Television Man, may I
ask a couple of questions?

59:00.495 --> 59:01.496
Of course, mate.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.165
Bigfoot's paws...

59:05.083 --> 59:08.628
What differentiates Bigfoot's
paws from other animals?

59:08.879 --> 59:10.714
Yeah, the...

59:11.923 --> 59:13.467
He's asking about the...

59:13.967 --> 59:15.844
- Bigfoot's paws.
- Yeah.

59:18.346 --> 59:20.992
Bigfoot scat. You ever
find any of that?

59:21.016 --> 59:22.684
That must be really interesting.

59:25.395 --> 59:26.480
- Scat?
- Scat.

59:27.189 --> 59:28.440
- Scat?
- Scat.

59:30.233 --> 59:33.445
I'm so glad you asked me
about the scat, because...

59:36.323 --> 59:39.743
Nickel for all the times school
children asked me about the scat.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.541
I guess I would say
about the scat...

59:50.128 --> 59:51.880
The scat is my favorite
part of the job.

59:52.297 --> 59:53.924
You know, put my hands in it.

59:55.300 --> 59:56.384
I get right in there.

59:57.928 --> 59:58.928
Yeah.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.603
I'm a bit drunk, but that
is definitely not a coyote.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.188
I have no idea what that was.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:10.784
- Maybe that's our Squatch.
- Wait a minute.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.150
Only one way to find out.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:13.777
What day is this?

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:18.657
Hey, Bart. Hey, Brock.
Hey, guys?

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.785
May? May, I know your secret.

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.078
May?

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.083
May?

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.043
Get that out of my face.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.087
Come on.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.428
Guys...

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.347
What the devil is
happening out here?

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:28.101
Probably a UFO dropping
off Bigfoot prisoners.

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:31.730
Sweet Yowie, how many monsters
you got in these woods?

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:35.126
Hey guys, there's nothing there.
Let's go back.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.568
It's obviously something.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:39.297
It got our attention, you can
bet your butt it got Bigfoot's.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.340
That's why I wanna go back,
because if Bigfoot's...

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.450
Jack, you're not making sense.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.076
I've gotta film
this for my show.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:47.370
Bart, come on...

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:52.959
Oh, hell.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:57.380
What the...?

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:09.410
Welcome to our first annual
Squatch Watch Spirit Gathering.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.371
Your what? Oh, no.
Quit that, lady.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.748
- Quit that!
- We're here to see Bigfoot.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.751
- We love Bigfoot.
- You people, you have to go.

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:19.027
- We love Bigfoot.
- You have to get out of here.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.695
Do your loving somewhere else.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.281
Jack, come over her.
Help me out.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.677
All right, folks. My
friend here is right.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:31.414
This is not really the time,
definitely not the place for the...

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.711
Feels kind of amazing.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:44.636
Jack, moonshine and tranquilizer
is not a good combination.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:46.388
Get the hell away from me.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:50.642
- He's one of us.
- One of us.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:52.078
One of us.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.080
I wanna be your
fuzzy little joey.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.648
One of us.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.709
What the hell is "one of us"?

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:01.087
- We're furries.
- What the hell's a furry?

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.530
A furry is a person.
They're people...

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.260
who just happen to like to
dress up in furry clothes

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.970
and rub up against each another.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.634
And I'll tell you
something else, Bart...

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.457
I'm a furry, okay, and
I'm damn proud of it!

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:25.260
Okay. That's it! Out of here!

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:26.845
But, we love Bigfoot.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.181
Lady, once I have Bigfoot
stuffed and mounted,

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.976
you're welcome to rub up
against him all you want.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:36.313
But until then, get your skinny
little chicken ass out of here.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.732
She's a bunny, Bart.
She's a bunny!

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.543
- What?
- She's a bunny.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:42.527
It doesn't work as a chicken.
She's a bunny!

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:44.904
Okay, then hop it
on out of here.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.532
Go on! I'm gonna count to ten.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.657
One...

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.150
If you wanna come to the next
meeting, just let me know.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:52.995
I will.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.498
I will and I do and I will.

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:59.794
Come on! Out!

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.172
Come on!

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.261
Now, as for you two.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:24.819
Was that a real gun
you shot back there?

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:26.905
Yep, and I'll use it again

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.282
if either one of you tries to
get into this tent tonight.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.373
Do your thing, Mr.
Television Man.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:37.874
What thing?

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.794
You know, that howling,
yodeling thing you do.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.698
I thought you said
it was stupid.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.006
No, it's perfect.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.883
You hear something?

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.301
Just shut up and do it.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:49.761
Jack, you stay here.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.766
I need you to film me.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:56.433
Okay.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.080
- Okay.
- Keep that right on me.

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.398
- Right.
- This is my good side.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.870
Stay on the face.
Stay on my face.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.503
He's out there. He's
definitely out there.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.613
He's getting closer.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.860
Sorry.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:34.781
Did I get him?

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:37.618
Did I get him?

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.081
Did I get him?

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:48.296
Yeah, you got him.

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.258
You got him, all right.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:58.181
Hey, Pottersville, I found Bigfoot!
Follow me!

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:01.601
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.354
Bigfoot can be
seen by the stars.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.105
Monster found!

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:09.484
Pick up, pick up.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.111
Come on, May, pick up the phone.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.739
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:18.910
what you are about to witness is
not just television history...

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.996
it's also scientific history.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:25.291
It's also world history.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:32.006
It may, in fact, be the most significant
event in the history of mankind.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:38.471
Because I have managed to do
what no one else ever could.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:42.433
Which is capture the world's
most elusive beast.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.147
Without further
ado, I present...

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:52.818
Bigfoot.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:56.488
Maynard!

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.990
Maynard!

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:00.660
Maynard.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.099
Maynard. What did you do to him?

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.208
I caught him. That's
my job, isn't it?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.085
- This isn't Bigfoot!
- Of course it is.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:12.439
Is this really what you do for a living?
This is Maynard Greiger.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.507
He runs the general store.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.009
Maynard.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.970
- Maynard.
- Shit.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.866
It's okay, Park. He's
gonna be all right.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:25.077
I just popped him with
a tranquilizer dart.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.520
Was that you in the
forest this entire time?

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.482
Maynard, are you okay?

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.234
So, this is all a big hoax?

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.572
Cameras off!

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.073
- Hey...
- This is a big hoax, isn't it?

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:43.202
Do you know who I am?

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.872
This was gonna be my
biggest show ever!

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:47.915
It was gonna make me a star!

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.877
Well, guess what?

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:53.296
I am gonna sue Pottersville.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:55.671
How do you like that?

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:58.718
That's right. You'll be ruined!

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:04.241
I don't care if a colony of Bigfoot
moves in and builds houses,

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.493
and starts raising their kids and
marching their kids back and forth

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.580
to school across the square every day,
and singing karaoke at the karaoke bar!

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:11.022
No one's ever gonna see it!

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:12.499
Because from now on,

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:17.694
Pottersville will be known as a
town of fakes and phonies...

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.240
and freaks.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:25.370
G'day, morons.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:31.084
Did somebody say they
needed a Bigfoot?

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:34.837
Well, nice work, Maynard, now the
whole town is gonna get sued.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.173
There goes Christmas.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.634
And we can all kiss a
Happy New Year goodbye.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.346
I ought to stick a "big
foot" up your ass.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.812
Hey, little bunny.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:55.149
I was thinking maybe I can
come over later and...

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:59.821
I'd love for you to come by tomorrow,
Maynard, and pack your stuff and leave.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.407
We all just wanted
to meet Bigfoot,

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.034
and you made us look
like a bunch of idiots.

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:09.706
I'm sorry.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:19.924
You okay, pal?

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.646
So you will be seeking
legal action?

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:34.957
That's right, yeah.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:38.127
It's the opposite of a class-action suit,
because it's me against 80 people.

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:40.778
It's like un-classy suit.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:44.991
It's not what you call it, but
I'm suing for damages, yeah.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.177
I have heard a
number, an estimate,

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:50.621
somewhere in the ballpark of 150
million dollars in damages.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.498
Is that what you
will be seeking?

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.626
I couldn't say, and I won't say.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.588
I'm not allowed to say,
but that's accurate, yes.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:04.635
I can't promise you anybody's gonna show
up, I mean, people are pretty upset.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.644
But you know his heart
was in the right place.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:10.016
Yeah. Well, I'll do my best.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:57.104
Hi. Is there a Maynard
Greiger here?

01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:59.190
I don't get it.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:04.111
Don't you know how much he loves
you, how much he loves this town?

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:11.869
Maynard's family has owned and operated
the general store for generations.

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:15.331
He's over there right now,
packing up his shop because...

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:18.334
he doesn't know what else to do.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:20.711
He feels like he
doesn't belong here.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.756
Well, he did ruin our shot.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:25.716
Your shot at what?

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:30.096
Fame, fortune. Being on TV.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:32.139
And how did he ruin it, exactly?

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.350
By pretending to be Bigfoot.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:37.645
How much Bigfoot merchandise
did you sell out of his store?

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.400
Did you ever offer him anything?

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:45.778
Did he ever ask for
anything in return?

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:49.031
He's given everything
to Pottersville.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:51.158
I mean everything.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:56.622
He's tried so hard to keep us and
this town afloat that, honestly,

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.017
I don't know if he could
afford to keep his store open

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.793
even if he felt like
you wanted him to.

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.553
You've all seen this.
You know what it's for.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:14.265
And at one time or another, when
you were down on your luck,

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:18.227
each and every one of you asked Maynard
to put your name in this book.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.938
Has he ever refused any of you?

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:26.485
Now when he needs our help, your
answer is to turn your back on him?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.947
Well, before you decide
that he ruined your shot,

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:34.452
or your Christmas, or your Happy New Year,
I just want you to take a look at this.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:39.040
Then you can tell me if you're still
upset with him for pretending.

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:49.759
It's empty.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:53.721
Yeah.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.864
Now we go live
to Stacy Gutierrez

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:16.160
for a story you'll only find
here on Channel 13 News. Stacy.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:17.745
Thank you, John.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:23.018
Hi, this is Stacy Gutierrez
reporting live on Christmas Eve

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:26.605
here in Pottersville, but
all is not merry and bright

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:30.049
as the town is still reeling
from the Bigfoot hoax.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.971
Well, I am here with the hoaxster
himself, Maynard Greiger,

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.639
to get his side of the story.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:39.016
So, Mr. Greiger,
why did you do it?

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.105
Well, I never meant for
it to happen, really.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:49.402
But when people started
really thinking I was Bigfoot

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:53.239
and I saw how happy it made
them, I figured, why not?

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:56.367
Why do you think this town
was so captivated by him?

01:14:56.909 --> 01:15:00.663
I don't think it's just our town, really.
I mean, it could be any town.

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.583
People everywhere are looking
for something to believe in.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:09.755
We had fallen on hard times,
like a lot of other places...

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:14.468
this magical sense of...
well, Bigfoot,

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.263
you know, that sense that
something else was out there.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.016
It really brought
the town together.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:23.686
I haven't seen this town so
alive in a long time, and...

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:30.609
It seemed to give everybody the faith and
hope that things were gonna be okay.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.404
I guess that's why I did it.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.784
If you had to do it all
over again, would you?

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:48.270
You know, let's just say that hope
isn't always the most realistic thing,

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:51.839
but it tends to make the
world a better place.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.634
Thank you, Mr. Greiger.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:58.637
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:03.059
This is Stacy Gutierrez
live from Pottersville.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:07.354
Thank you, Mr. Greiger,
that was great.

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:09.148
My pleasure. You're welcome.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.236
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.238
I have some friends who
want to talk to you.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:19.450
Hey, fellas. What's going on?

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.578
Thanks for letting us sell
our stuff out of your store.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:26.415
And thank you also for just...
well...

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:29.794
Oh, what the hell.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.219
You're welcome.

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:41.615
Hey, Tammy.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:44.433
I'm sorry I was so
hard on you, Maynard.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.794
Hey. Yeah, we've gotta
get back on the air.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:56.112
There's another breaking
story happening here now.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.131
You could never
ruin our Christmas.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:16:59.156
Thanks, Doris.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:02.636
Maynard, forget the things I said.
Merry Christmas.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.744
Thank you.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.286
Thanks.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:12.128
Maynard, I'm so sorry I said
I'd put my foot up your ass.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.397
It's okay, Millie.

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.841
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Millie.

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:21.804
- Hey, Maynard.
- Jasper.

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:23.347
Thanks for everything, man.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:27.268
Yeah. Sure.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.270
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:32.439
You thought you had to become
Bigfoot to save this town,

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.985
but you saved it a long
time ago by just being you.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:41.699
Hi, this is Stacy Gutierrez
reporting live on Christmas Eve

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.618
from Greiger's General Store
here in Pottersville,

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:49.248
where the entire community has
turned out in a show of support

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:53.169
for the one-time Bigfoot
hoaxster Maynard Greiger,

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.839
to receive him now as
their hometown hero.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:17:59.048
Hey, buddy.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:03.304
It's truly a Christmas miracle.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.891
Hi. Thanks, Maynard.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:09.393
- Merry Christmas, Maynard.
- Merry Christmas.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.525
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:19.486
What are you doing later?

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.827
I think you should close
up and come home.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.874
You can bring the
Bigfoot costume.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.631
I've been wanting to talk
to you for a long time.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:40.090
I know you have.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.426
You were right.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.346
I know, baby.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.657
Your little bunny's
always right.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:48.974
No, you were right...

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.356
We should split up.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.126
Excuse me?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.443
You should be happy.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:03.572
You should go and find whatever
excitement you can in life,

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:04.865
if that's what you want.

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:06.616
I get it.

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.494
Life is short.

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:10.579
Why not be happy?

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.333
That's all I wanted to tell you.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.502
I don't...

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.006
Wait. Are you...?

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:26.804
This is it?

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:49.618
Hey, Parker, is that rain check
still available for the Jiffy Pop?

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:54.873
Always.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:02.798
To Maynard Greiger...

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.527
the richest man in Pottersville.

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:07.428
Hear, hear.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:11.908
Hey. Norm? Tony?

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:14.935
You say people all over the
world love this Bigfoot, right?

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.913
Um, yeah.

01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:20.524
On every continent and
in every language.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:21.942
- All of them.
- Yeah.

01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:24.193
All right.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:33.138
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just received word

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:36.099
it appears that Brock Masterson,
host of Monster Finder,

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:38.101
is also not who he claims to be.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.104
In an exclusive story you'll only
see here on Channel 13 News,

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:45.424
we've discovered that Brock Masterson
is actually one Leonard Abromowitz,

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.843
an actor from Coney Island.

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:50.864
Last time I checked, that's
nowhere near Australia.

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.139
Well, what do you know?

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.441
Hey, you two. What
are you doing?

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:28.485
We're just here to meet
Bill on his lunch break.

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:30.528
This place is amazing, you two.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.696
Thanks, Maynard!

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.138
- You bet ya.
- Have fun.

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:34.431
Thanks.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.657
You're a good man, May.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.746
Well, what are you gonna do?
