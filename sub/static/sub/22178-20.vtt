00:00.042 --> 00:02.093
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...

00:02.169 --> 00:03.268
I got something for you.

00:03.303 --> 00:06.328
It's a family thing.
It's for our travels.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.433
I was clear that when I
came back to the Heights,

00:09.468 --> 00:11.168
it was to get that dagger.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.725
I've missed you so much.

00:15.609 --> 00:17.109
Papa, no!

00:19.378 --> 00:21.180
The curse didn't break.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.280
If you won't help cast the spell for me,

00:23.315 --> 00:24.948
do it to save your father.

00:25.183 --> 00:26.228
Don't do it, Tilly.

00:26.253 --> 00:27.435
You are my father.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.785
And that's why I have to do this.

00:40.566 --> 00:42.199
It didn't work!

00:42.234 --> 00:43.600
Lucy, what are you talking about?

00:43.635 --> 00:44.334
What didn't work?

00:44.370 --> 00:45.745
True. Love's. Kiss.

00:45.770 --> 00:47.137
My mom and Henry kissed.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.647
But Henry's poisoned.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.350
Not anymore. I found all the
pieces of the Glass Slipper

00:51.385 --> 00:53.118
and Mr. Samdi cured him.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.953
But doesn't matter... we're still...

00:54.988 --> 00:57.538
cursed.

00:57.936 --> 00:59.131
I don't know about cursed,

00:59.156 --> 01:01.760
but those clouds aren't a great sign.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.462
They're not clouds. It's a re-birth.

01:06.772 --> 01:09.668
The balance of nature
is shifting, Regina.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.571
We're on the precipice
of a great extinction...

01:12.606 --> 01:15.107
one that man cannot crawl back from.

01:15.142 --> 01:17.909
So you're wiping out
humanity with a rainstorm?

01:19.012 --> 01:20.278
How biblical.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.415
Oh, it's going to be
much worse than that.

01:23.907 --> 01:26.084
But I'm here to offer you salvation.

01:26.657 --> 01:29.265
You were once the Eighth Witch.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.590
Join me now and your
family will be spared.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.059
Sorry, but I'm not really a joiner.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.362
You may have brought us
here, but this is my home now.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.364
And I protect my own.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.733
With what magic?

01:41.999 --> 01:43.635
Your son couldn't break my curse.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.499
Do you think that was an accident?

01:45.524 --> 01:46.738
What did you do to Henry?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.673
I didn't have to do anything.

01:49.099 --> 01:51.304
Did you ever notice how human children

01:51.361 --> 01:53.661
have a nasty way of growing up?

01:53.697 --> 01:56.097
An adult's belief is a lot less potent.

01:56.132 --> 01:58.366
You don't know Henry.
He has the heart...

01:58.401 --> 01:59.709
The heart of the Truest Believer.

01:59.734 --> 02:00.900
Yes, I know.

02:01.171 --> 02:04.934
But your Henry also has
more pain than you know.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.926
Hmm. His belief is gone

02:07.951 --> 02:10.645
and there's nothing you
can do to bring it back.

02:29.962 --> 02:32.133
Do we really have to do this now, Mom?

02:32.168 --> 02:34.669
Come on, it's your last
first day of school.

02:34.704 --> 02:36.134
Just give me this,

02:36.159 --> 02:38.339
and you'll never have to do it again.

02:41.177 --> 02:42.877
Okay.

02:54.746 --> 02:56.846
Henry? Wait.

02:59.536 --> 03:01.696
You forgot your lunch.

03:01.731 --> 03:02.897
Seriously?

03:02.932 --> 03:04.866
I haven't used a lunch
box since fifth grade.

03:04.901 --> 03:06.834
Oh, just open it.

03:11.975 --> 03:13.107
No way.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.712
Henry, I know you think I
treat you like a child, but...

03:17.747 --> 03:19.514
Well, you're not my little boy anymore.

03:19.549 --> 03:21.149
And next year you'll need this car

03:21.184 --> 03:23.184
to drive across town
to Storybrooke College.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.254
Right.

03:26.876 --> 03:28.823
This is, uh, great.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.058
What is it, Henry?

03:31.094 --> 03:34.228
It's just... I'm not sure if SBC

03:34.264 --> 03:36.101
is the right move for me...

03:36.906 --> 03:38.738
since it's not a move at all.

03:38.763 --> 03:40.029
It's still in Storybrooke.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.370
Well, what's wrong with
that? Storybrooke's your home.

03:42.405 --> 03:44.439
But I'm the only kid
that wasn't whisked here

03:44.474 --> 03:45.706
from the Enchanted Forest.

03:45.742 --> 03:47.008
I'm from the real world.

03:47.043 --> 03:50.097
Maybe I should get out there
and consider other options.

03:50.122 --> 03:51.156
Other options.

03:51.181 --> 03:54.015
Thanks, Mom. I'll bring
her home without a scratch.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.971
I'm sorry, I don't
remember ordering a traitor

04:17.005 --> 04:18.706
with a side of betrayal.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.274
Lucy told me about Gothel's visit.

04:21.310 --> 04:24.479
Yes, well, then you know
she has magic and we don't.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.181
I'm trying to harness
what I can from that storm

04:27.474 --> 04:30.041
so I can at least go a
round or two with her.

04:31.287 --> 04:33.723
Perhaps this could
be of some assistance.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.426
I managed to distill a
dusting of memory potion

04:38.461 --> 04:39.727
from Nick's blood.

04:39.762 --> 04:42.830
Lucy told me what Gothel
said about Henry's belief.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.899
And you think if he remembers who he is,

04:44.934 --> 04:46.367
he'll believe again...

04:46.975 --> 04:48.536
The kiss will work.

04:48.571 --> 04:50.638
The curse will break.

04:50.673 --> 04:52.920
We will have our magic back.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.842
Just a few days ago

04:54.878 --> 04:58.613
you screwed over your own
grandson to save yourself.

04:58.726 --> 05:01.160
Why be a team player now?

05:03.253 --> 05:05.319
I'm beginning to realize

05:05.355 --> 05:07.855
I may never get back to Belle.

05:09.459 --> 05:11.459
So perhaps...

05:11.736 --> 05:14.570
I should help the family I do have here.

05:15.598 --> 05:18.299
Look, I-I'm sorry for what I did.

05:18.334 --> 05:20.001
I didn't mean to hurt Henry.

05:21.371 --> 05:23.137
Let me fix this.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.174
Let me help you

05:27.210 --> 05:29.677
before it's too late.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.590
Tilly...

05:42.625 --> 05:43.824
Tilly!

05:43.860 --> 05:45.493
It's too late, Detective.

05:45.528 --> 05:48.940
What's too late? What's happening?

05:56.706 --> 05:58.506
What the bloody hell was that?

05:58.541 --> 06:00.308
She's been gifted.

06:03.246 --> 06:05.646
When a member has completed her task...

06:05.682 --> 06:07.448
given all that she has,

06:07.483 --> 06:10.184
she is rewarded with a
place in the Eternal Grove.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.853
What about you?

06:11.878 --> 06:13.721
Will you be rewarded as handsomely?

06:13.756 --> 06:15.523
They are the chosen ones.

06:15.558 --> 06:18.225
I will be spared...

06:18.261 --> 06:20.728
but not rewarded.

06:21.004 --> 06:24.172
But you will find the worst...

06:29.205 --> 06:30.371
Oh!

06:36.019 --> 06:37.785
Tilly, we have to get out of here now

06:37.810 --> 06:39.242
before that witch comes back.

06:39.267 --> 06:40.333
No.

06:40.485 --> 06:42.418
I can't do that.

06:43.086 --> 06:45.786
I'm to be with Mother.

06:46.132 --> 06:47.888
The hell you are.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.177
What the hell?

06:53.212 --> 06:56.714
Tilly, what are you doing?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.150
I don't know what's happening, but...

06:59.185 --> 07:01.138
I will come back for you.

07:01.239 --> 07:03.554
I will save you.

07:13.608 --> 07:15.208
Stop. You're stripping the threads.

07:15.243 --> 07:16.976
Sorry.

07:17.012 --> 07:19.512
Look kid, I'm happy to
let you borrow my tools,

07:19.547 --> 07:21.514
but you got to respect the machine.

07:21.549 --> 07:25.360
This is vintage Curse-Era Classic.

07:25.385 --> 07:26.727
Hey, Granny...

07:26.752 --> 07:29.072
would you mind picking us up
a few grilled-cheese sandwiches

07:29.097 --> 07:30.444
- for lunch?
- Glad to.

07:30.469 --> 07:33.236
No one should be doing auto
maintenance on an empty stomach.

07:34.896 --> 07:36.429
So...

07:36.464 --> 07:38.698
I-I may have hit a curb...

07:38.733 --> 07:41.034
and dinged the passenger door.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.269
Oh, Henry, do you know
what I put this car through?

07:43.304 --> 07:45.796
Scratches are a part of life.

07:45.874 --> 07:48.248
Look, I... I've been thinking,

07:48.273 --> 07:53.546
and maybe your future
is outside Storybrooke.

07:53.581 --> 07:55.048
Mom...

07:55.083 --> 07:57.016
I thought you didn't
want me to leave home?

07:57.052 --> 07:58.418
Oh, I don't.

07:58.453 --> 08:03.589
But being a parent also
means learning to let go.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.058
Really?

08:05.093 --> 08:07.060
Henry, I just want you to be happy.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.495
And even if happiness means...

08:09.531 --> 08:10.947
a rowing crew in Ithaca.

08:10.972 --> 08:13.209
Or... a chess club in Boston.

08:13.234 --> 08:15.068
Or studying film in Los Angeles.

08:17.072 --> 08:19.005
Whatever you want.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.873
Even... California.

08:20.909 --> 08:22.542
Thanks, Mom.

08:29.507 --> 08:31.117
Hey! Roni.

08:31.152 --> 08:32.618
That's a nice surprise.
What are you doing here?

08:32.654 --> 08:36.121
Well, I haven't seen my
favorite customer in a while.

08:36.157 --> 08:38.051
I want to make sure
you're eating, all right?

08:38.076 --> 08:39.808
Ohh.

08:40.794 --> 08:42.260
Ohh, grilled cheese.

08:42.297 --> 08:43.863
Nice.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.599
Can I get you anything? Water? Whisky?

08:46.634 --> 08:48.434
Coffee's fine.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.944
So, uh... what's with the bags?

08:57.979 --> 09:00.179
Oh. I'm taking Jacinda and Lucy

09:00.215 --> 09:01.948
to Bainbridge Island this weekend.

09:01.983 --> 09:03.983
Jacinda kinda has a
thing for that place.

09:04.018 --> 09:06.886
Oh. So the rumors are true.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.489
Yeah, Jacinda and I are definitely,

09:09.524 --> 09:12.725
officially... some sort of thing.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.594
Well, that's great, Henry.

09:14.629 --> 09:17.163
All right, here you go.

09:17.198 --> 09:18.898
A cup of Mills' finest.

09:32.286 --> 09:34.319
Roni, everything okay?

09:35.624 --> 09:37.257
It didn't work.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.720
Gothel was right.

09:40.755 --> 09:43.022
Gothel? What are you talking about?

09:44.225 --> 09:45.691
Is this about the fairy tale stuff?

09:45.727 --> 09:46.826
Did Lucy send you here?

09:46.861 --> 09:48.295
Because she and I already had a talk...

09:48.320 --> 09:50.584
This doesn't have
anything to do with Lucy.

09:50.609 --> 09:53.032
Henry, something bad is happening here.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.400
I need your help.

09:54.435 --> 09:56.068
Bad, like a curse?

09:56.104 --> 09:58.004
Roni, we are not fairy tale characters.

09:58.039 --> 09:59.972
Why else would you have kissed Jacinda?

10:00.008 --> 10:01.407
Because I am in love with her.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.576
Okay. Well, the glass slipper...
how do you explain that?

10:03.611 --> 10:07.002
I don't know, a
coincidence, a sign maybe

10:07.027 --> 10:09.327
to get over ourselves and just kiss.

10:09.352 --> 10:10.429
And we did.

10:10.454 --> 10:12.018
And the only thing that
it broke was my delusion

10:12.053 --> 10:13.986
that I need to be
somebody else to be happy.

10:14.022 --> 10:16.422
No, but a part of you wanted to believe.

10:16.457 --> 10:18.257
Or else what's all this?

10:18.293 --> 10:20.459
Nick was a psychopath.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.396
And I admit it, I went deep
down into the rabbit hole.

10:23.431 --> 10:25.231
But I was wrong.

10:25.266 --> 10:28.401
You're rationalizing away your belief...

10:28.436 --> 10:29.702
like an adult.

10:29.737 --> 10:30.903
I am an adult.

10:30.939 --> 10:33.105
Roni, why do you care
so much about this?

10:33.141 --> 10:35.007
Because this isn't like you, Henry.

10:36.447 --> 10:37.910
Don't you want to believe?

10:37.946 --> 10:41.681
I do believe... in real
Henry and real Jacinda

10:41.716 --> 10:43.149
and our real future.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.917
Listen to me, I am done

10:44.953 --> 10:47.620
searching for answers
in some imaginary past.

10:56.287 --> 10:58.193
_

10:58.247 --> 11:00.766
Hey, Luce. Want to put that phone down

11:00.802 --> 11:02.235
and help me pack?

11:02.270 --> 11:05.471
I think it's gonna rain.
Maybe we shouldn't go tonight.

11:05.506 --> 11:06.906
Jay! I found that extra bag.

11:06.941 --> 11:09.275
I forget it was in the
trunk holding spare tees...

11:09.300 --> 11:11.937
Seriously? How long are
you guys gonna be gone?

11:11.962 --> 11:14.180
Bainbridge at this time of year?

11:14.215 --> 11:16.015
Got to be prepared for any weather.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.817
Like apocalyptic storms.

11:17.852 --> 11:19.552
Yeah, it is pretty nasty out there.

11:19.587 --> 11:20.686
Not you, too.

11:20.711 --> 11:22.358
Why is everyone on edge today?

11:22.383 --> 11:24.256
I still haven't heard from Drew.

11:24.281 --> 11:26.025
It's not like him to go MIA.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.261
Um, Did Drew ever use this bag?

11:28.296 --> 11:29.452
Yeah. Why?

11:29.477 --> 11:31.697
I think I might know
who you should talk to.

11:31.733 --> 11:32.932
Mr. Samdi.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.301
The shady businessman? Why?

11:35.852 --> 11:38.353
He also deals in tarot cards.

11:39.340 --> 11:41.707
I've, uh, seen him around Roni's.

11:42.465 --> 11:45.177
Well, it looks like I will
be paying Mr. Samdi a visit.

11:45.213 --> 11:47.680
Wait, I'm coming with
you. Luce, keep packing.

11:56.491 --> 11:57.697
Where the hell have you been?

11:57.722 --> 12:00.426
I need you to tell me what the
hell is going on in this town.

12:00.461 --> 12:03.265
I just spent the night tied
up in the bowels of the city.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.686
And I saw... things. All right?

12:05.711 --> 12:08.467
So either I'm going crazy, or
Eloise Gardner drugged me, or...

12:08.503 --> 12:09.902
Magic is real.

12:11.306 --> 12:12.271
Magic is...?

12:12.307 --> 12:15.641
Real. All of it.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.778
Everything you read
in Henry Mills' book.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.457
We are all from another realm.

12:21.893 --> 12:23.983
Eloise is a witch named Gothel,

12:24.018 --> 12:26.085
and what you saw her doing was magic.

12:26.127 --> 12:27.972
Now, if you want proof, I imagine

12:27.997 --> 12:30.531
anything I have to
offer pales in comparison

12:30.566 --> 12:32.495
to what you witnessed last night.

12:32.917 --> 12:33.673
Yeah, you're right.

12:33.698 --> 12:35.502
What I witnessed last
night strains reason.

12:35.538 --> 12:37.404
But so does what you are saying now.

12:37.439 --> 12:39.072
The choice is simple...

12:39.428 --> 12:42.295
madness... or take a leap of faith.

12:43.684 --> 12:45.751
Believe your eyes.

12:45.776 --> 12:47.778
Believe me.

12:51.566 --> 12:53.433
I'm not mad.

12:54.990 --> 12:56.490
I know.

12:58.167 --> 13:03.864
She said... Eloise said
that Tilly is my daughter.

13:03.899 --> 13:06.967
And you felt a connection to
her from the moment you met.

13:07.002 --> 13:09.069
A connection that's
troubled you ever since.

13:09.104 --> 13:11.320
- Isn't that right?
- Aye.

13:11.445 --> 13:13.173
And my heart... when I got near her,

13:13.209 --> 13:16.343
it was like I was being
stabbed by a million knives.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.779
Gothel poisoned your
heart as a punishment

13:18.814 --> 13:20.547
to keep you and your daughter separate.

13:20.858 --> 13:22.691
Now that she's bringing magic back,

13:22.716 --> 13:24.651
I guess the poison must
have activated again.

13:24.687 --> 13:26.653
That must be why I couldn't rescue her.

13:27.398 --> 13:28.622
Rescue her from what?

13:28.657 --> 13:30.795
I... I don't know.

13:30.820 --> 13:33.936
So the coven is locked in
a ritual and Tilly is, too.

13:33.961 --> 13:35.562
They have her under some kind of spell.

13:35.598 --> 13:37.490
Well, maybe we can break it.

13:37.515 --> 13:38.899
Get her out of there.

13:38.934 --> 13:40.667
- How?
- Follow me.

13:40.703 --> 13:42.769
I have an idea.

13:43.513 --> 13:44.938
Hey...

13:45.786 --> 13:47.714
if what you say is true...

13:49.245 --> 13:54.744
who was... am I... in this other place?

13:55.818 --> 14:00.120
All you need to know right
now is... you're a survivor.

14:03.317 --> 14:04.836
Captain.

14:14.463 --> 14:16.096
Hey, Detectives.

14:16.131 --> 14:17.631
Nasty out there, isn't it?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.178
Can I get you something hot to drink?

14:19.214 --> 14:20.947
Well, unfortunately it's
only gonna get worse.

14:20.982 --> 14:22.148
And we need you to come with us.

14:22.183 --> 14:23.449
What? Why?

14:23.485 --> 14:25.551
Is this about the
overdue parking tickets?

14:25.587 --> 14:27.720
No, you're fine. This is about Tilly.

14:27.745 --> 14:29.127
She's in trouble. We need your help.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.125
What kind of trouble?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.680
Tilly and I were on a case,

14:31.705 --> 14:35.130
and she was taken by some... bad people.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.133
And to make matters worse,
she's in one of her states.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.825
You think I can help get through to her?

14:39.850 --> 14:41.937
You may be the only
one that can help her.

14:41.973 --> 14:45.140
Look, we really don't have a lot
of time, she's in real danger.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.551
Is that...

14:55.586 --> 14:56.885
Yes.

14:56.921 --> 14:59.788
This is where Henry's
belief went to die.

15:00.362 --> 15:02.658
This is where he thinks his family is.

15:03.742 --> 15:07.463
You're not gonna dig them up
to prove him wrong... are you?

15:08.047 --> 15:09.631
No.

15:10.468 --> 15:12.268
Then why are we here?

15:12.293 --> 15:15.261
Because there are other
ways of waking people up.

15:18.146 --> 15:19.800
The Storybook. Of... Of course.

15:19.825 --> 15:21.577
When Emma touched it, she believed.

15:21.612 --> 15:24.996
And maybe if Henry touches
the second storybook,

15:25.021 --> 15:27.152
it might have the same effect.

15:28.152 --> 15:30.152
I've looked everywhere for it.

15:30.187 --> 15:33.155
I haven't seen it since my
step-grandma showed it to me.

15:33.190 --> 15:35.491
Victoria knew how powerful that book is.

15:36.190 --> 15:37.860
And if anyone wanted it,

15:37.895 --> 15:40.665
you'd have to pry it
from her cold, dead hands.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.999
You think the storybook is in there?

15:44.035 --> 15:46.101
Why do you think I kept
my vault in a cemetery?

15:46.137 --> 15:47.803
When you have secrets that powerful,

15:47.838 --> 15:49.171
you take them to the grave.

15:49.206 --> 15:51.140
So we're just gonna dig it up?

15:51.175 --> 15:53.342
Not we... me.

15:53.377 --> 15:55.444
Your mission is to get
your father to the bar.

15:55.479 --> 15:59.181
Henry was always the one who
made the rest of us believe.

15:59.872 --> 16:02.384
Today we're gonna return the favor.

16:10.285 --> 16:12.661
You missed a great fundraiser.

16:12.940 --> 16:16.074
Looks like we'll finally be
able to rebuild the athletic club

16:16.099 --> 16:18.705
after that old Snow Monster incident.

16:19.339 --> 16:21.236
What are those?

16:23.407 --> 16:25.441
You got into Madison...

16:25.476 --> 16:29.202
B.U., USC, Wesleyan, Bard.

16:29.227 --> 16:31.523
You got into every
school you applied to.

16:31.548 --> 16:33.537
I am so proud.

16:33.562 --> 16:34.783
Thanks, Mom.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.152
I'll call Emma and get her
to rally everybody at Granny's

16:37.188 --> 16:38.921
so you can break the
good news in person.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.891
Maybe... maybe we could
wait a sec to tell everyone.

16:42.927 --> 16:44.793
What's wrong?

16:44.829 --> 16:47.996
It's just... In the entrance essays,

16:48.501 --> 16:51.867
the Henry Mills I was writing
about wasn't really me.

16:52.322 --> 16:54.033
What are you talking about?

16:54.853 --> 16:58.340
I couldn't write about the time
I got kidnapped to Neverland.

16:58.376 --> 17:00.943
Or how I met my first
girlfriend in Camelot.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.745
I even had to lie about my own home.

17:02.780 --> 17:03.846
I read those essays.

17:03.881 --> 17:05.781
They were exceptionally well written.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.549
That's not the point.

17:07.585 --> 17:10.519
They didn't accept the real Henry Mills.

17:10.882 --> 17:13.555
And i-if I go out there and keep lying,

17:13.952 --> 17:16.858
I won't be me anymore.

17:17.483 --> 17:19.728
Maybe I'm better off
just staying at home.

17:21.013 --> 17:22.420
Mom...

17:23.367 --> 17:25.768
what do I do?

17:26.598 --> 17:29.972
I wish I can tell you to
stay here and never grow up.

17:30.981 --> 17:33.208
But you're already grown up.

17:33.509 --> 17:36.527
And the only person who
can tell you what to do...

17:37.671 --> 17:38.947
is you.

17:49.127 --> 17:50.592
What's this?

17:50.628 --> 17:52.728
Lucy, where's your mom?

17:52.763 --> 17:54.463
Jacinda isn't coming.

17:54.936 --> 17:57.032
I asked Lucy to bring you here.

17:57.561 --> 18:00.624
Henry, there's something
I need to show you.

18:05.776 --> 18:08.069
This is Book Two.

18:08.245 --> 18:10.879
The story of us.

18:11.874 --> 18:13.091
Really, Roni?

18:13.116 --> 18:14.450
We've already been through this.

18:14.485 --> 18:16.797
Henry, I know you don't want to believe.

18:16.822 --> 18:18.141
But I need you to.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.000
Just touch the book, and then
you'll remember everything.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.226
Fine.

18:25.796 --> 18:28.597
You want me to touch the book, okay.

18:40.644 --> 18:42.478
See?

18:43.781 --> 18:46.415
Nothing's changed. I'm
still me... Henry Mills...

18:46.450 --> 18:48.417
Failed author and
five-star Swyft driver.

18:48.452 --> 18:49.818
Lucy, wait!

18:49.854 --> 18:51.377
Henry. Just...

18:51.402 --> 18:52.531
What is going on with you today?

18:52.556 --> 18:54.623
You don't really believe
all this stuff, do you?

18:57.102 --> 18:58.861
This isn't a fake photo.

18:58.896 --> 19:00.262
I looked into it...

19:00.297 --> 19:04.399
A real Regina Mills adopted
a Henry Mills in Boston.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.101
These are the adoption papers.

19:08.028 --> 19:09.661
It's my signature.

19:10.178 --> 19:11.507
I'm Regina.

19:11.542 --> 19:12.875
It's all true, Henry.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.142
I am your mother.

19:14.178 --> 19:15.744
No, you are not my mother.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.180
I don't have a mother.
No one gave me a home.

19:18.215 --> 19:21.517
I made my own home, and
it went up in flames, Roni.

19:21.552 --> 19:23.785
And all I am trying to do
right now is just move on,

19:23.821 --> 19:25.053
and you won't let me. Why?

19:25.089 --> 19:26.522
Because I need you!

19:26.557 --> 19:28.156
Okay, fine. You know what?

19:28.192 --> 19:30.331
I'll play along. Say my book is real...

19:30.356 --> 19:31.827
where are all the real heroes, then?

19:31.862 --> 19:34.062
Where is Snow? Where is
Charming? Where is Emma?

19:34.098 --> 19:36.331
W-Where are these
heroes to save the day?

19:36.367 --> 19:39.001
Doesn't everybody
always find each other?

19:39.384 --> 19:42.271
You can't find someone if you
don't know they're missing.

19:42.704 --> 19:44.737
What the hell does that even mean?

19:46.876 --> 19:50.642
Gothel's curse didn't just
bring us to a Land Without Magic.

19:51.736 --> 19:53.749
It brought us back in time.

19:56.073 --> 19:58.907
Henry... you grew up.

19:59.220 --> 20:03.425
You left home. You went
on amazing adventures.

20:03.460 --> 20:07.329
But Gothel brought you, and all of us,

20:07.364 --> 20:10.232
back to this specific time.

20:10.749 --> 20:12.076
Which means, right now,

20:12.101 --> 20:15.470
I'm technically still in
Storybrooke, and so are you.

20:16.364 --> 20:17.940
Roni, listen to me.

20:18.707 --> 20:20.576
This has to stop.

20:20.611 --> 20:22.611
I'm not your hero.

20:22.646 --> 20:25.380
You didn't adopt a son.
I am not that little kid.

20:25.416 --> 20:26.415
Yes, you are.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.717
You just stopped believing in yourself.

20:28.752 --> 20:29.952
Don't you get it?

20:29.987 --> 20:33.031
No one wants to believe that
this is real more than I do.

20:33.056 --> 20:35.197
Because if this is real,
that means that the pain

20:35.222 --> 20:39.213
that I carry around every
single day doesn't exist.

20:40.944 --> 20:43.599
But it is still right there.

20:44.882 --> 20:47.581
So no, I am not your boy wonder.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.107
I am just a sad grown man

20:52.142 --> 20:54.009
who couldn't even save his own family.

20:59.059 --> 21:00.983
Henry, I get it.

21:01.018 --> 21:02.559
I had thought it was just the curse,

21:02.584 --> 21:05.454
but your pain is real.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.364
Because the day we were cursed,

21:08.389 --> 21:10.826
you couldn't save your family.

21:10.861 --> 21:13.528
You were kidnapped, and you're
still blaming yourself for it.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.530
But the difference
between what you believe

21:15.566 --> 21:19.601
and what I believe is that
I know you can still save us.

21:21.005 --> 21:23.105
Because we're right here.

21:23.140 --> 21:25.965
We've always been with you.

21:27.652 --> 21:30.946
I just need you to remember that.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.018
Bye, Roni.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.632
You okay, luv?

21:50.668 --> 21:52.300
My hands are shaking.

21:52.336 --> 21:54.770
There's a good chance that
you're gonna see something...

21:54.805 --> 21:56.138
unusual.

21:56.173 --> 21:58.340
Just know that you're
not mad. All right?

22:15.774 --> 22:17.926
Okay. It's okay.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.929
I once went to an ayahuasca
ceremony in Iquitos.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.798
I can handle this.

22:35.825 --> 22:39.091
Hey, Tilly.

22:39.116 --> 22:41.817
It's me, Margot.

22:42.122 --> 22:43.385
Look, there are a lot of people

22:43.420 --> 22:45.409
who are really worried about you.

22:45.434 --> 22:48.023
But I know you're just
having one of your bad days.

22:48.058 --> 22:51.860
But if you come with me, maybe
we can turn it into a good one.

22:51.980 --> 22:54.748
Hm? What do you say?

22:57.231 --> 22:58.797
No.

23:26.685 --> 23:28.852
We have to get to Tilly.

23:29.503 --> 23:30.902
Aah!

23:35.809 --> 23:38.243
What the hell's going on?

23:38.379 --> 23:40.711
Last night, I saw this.

23:40.736 --> 23:43.037
They were turning into trees.

23:44.518 --> 23:47.252
The spell is almost complete.

23:48.770 --> 23:51.623
- Tilly, stop!
- Don't do any more, Tilly!

23:59.173 --> 24:01.107
What the hell are you doing in here?

24:01.142 --> 24:02.341
Business hours are over.

24:02.377 --> 24:03.943
I don't know what kind of "business"

24:03.978 --> 24:05.360
you are running here,
but I have a feeling

24:05.385 --> 24:07.780
it has more to do than
backing Beignet Wars.

24:07.815 --> 24:10.850
And I have a feeling you
know something about Drew.

24:10.885 --> 24:12.551
We found this in his bag,

24:12.587 --> 24:14.820
and my daughter says it belongs to you.

24:14.856 --> 24:17.290
I know you tried to
manipulate him before.

24:17.818 --> 24:19.631
Where is Drew?

24:19.656 --> 24:21.928
Since you asked so politely...

24:21.963 --> 24:25.064
you need only look behind that door.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.739
Drew!

24:34.503 --> 24:36.486
Now that you've found him,

24:36.511 --> 24:39.278
why don't you sit down and join him?

24:39.313 --> 24:41.313
And why the hell would we do that?

24:41.348 --> 24:42.815
Ohh!

24:42.850 --> 24:44.149
Oh, my...

24:44.185 --> 24:46.752
Because I can be very convincing.

24:46.787 --> 24:49.211
Now in the closet, both of you.

24:56.063 --> 24:58.130
- Lucy, please. Just li...
- No!

24:58.165 --> 25:00.933
You could believe,
you just don't want to!

25:00.968 --> 25:03.059
It doesn't work that way. Okay?

25:03.084 --> 25:05.170
You may not understand now,
but you will when you're older.

25:05.206 --> 25:07.673
I wish you could remember
what it was like to be a kid...

25:07.708 --> 25:10.642
To... to believe... I
wish you never grew up!

25:15.816 --> 25:19.685
Okay. I guess... we're not
going to the island tonight.

25:20.448 --> 25:22.855
I'll call your mom.

25:31.078 --> 25:33.547
- _
- Really?

26:09.489 --> 26:12.824
I got it, Mom!

26:13.097 --> 26:14.339
Hello?

26:15.351 --> 26:17.142
My name's Henry.

26:17.177 --> 26:18.744
You can't eat that. It's poison.

26:20.748 --> 26:22.514
You can make them love you.

26:22.549 --> 26:23.649
I love you, Henry.

26:23.684 --> 26:25.350
I love you, too.

26:28.022 --> 26:29.988
I'm willing to take a risk, Henry.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.833
Hello? Who's calling?

26:42.100 --> 26:46.402
Is this... Henry Mills?

26:47.240 --> 26:48.261
Yeah.

26:48.286 --> 26:49.508
Who's this?

26:50.302 --> 26:51.710
Uh...

26:51.745 --> 26:53.578
I'm, uh...

26:54.034 --> 26:55.614
I'm just a friend of your mother's.

26:55.649 --> 26:58.383
Oh, you must be calling
about the graduation party.

26:58.419 --> 27:01.386
Yeah, we moved it. We're
meeting at Granny's now.

27:01.422 --> 27:05.457
It's my... uh, your... graduation?

27:05.999 --> 27:08.093
Yep. Heh. Sure is.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.362
Are you a friend of my
mom's from work or something?

27:10.397 --> 27:11.396
Should I go get her?

27:11.432 --> 27:12.798
Oh, no, no, no. Wait.

27:14.273 --> 27:16.902
I just called to congratulate you.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.572
Oh. Well, thanks.

27:21.671 --> 27:22.905
So...

27:24.405 --> 27:25.780
what's next?

27:27.647 --> 27:29.281
To be honest...

27:29.316 --> 27:30.916
You're having doubts.

27:32.586 --> 27:34.319
I told my mom is was

27:34.355 --> 27:38.123
because I didn't want
to lie about who I am.

27:38.158 --> 27:40.092
But, um...

27:40.831 --> 27:44.386
it's hard... letting go of this place.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.465
Believe me, I know.

27:48.333 --> 27:52.004
Um, can I give you a piece of advice?

27:52.489 --> 27:55.640
Advice someone gave me a long
time ago at my graduation?

27:56.402 --> 27:57.935
Sure.

27:58.263 --> 28:00.479
Home isn't a place.

28:03.229 --> 28:05.217
It's the people in it.

28:07.807 --> 28:09.588
And they will always

28:09.623 --> 28:11.088
be with you.

28:13.761 --> 28:15.861
Who'd you say this was again?

28:16.351 --> 28:18.663
Just someone who believes in you.

28:19.335 --> 28:21.867
Henry! We're gonna be late.

28:21.902 --> 28:23.769
Hold on, Mom.

28:23.804 --> 28:25.470
I'm sorry. I-I got to go.

28:25.506 --> 28:27.572
Have fun at your party, kid.

28:27.608 --> 28:29.608
And when you're opening your gifts,

28:30.044 --> 28:31.410
make sure you don't miss the tiny one

28:31.445 --> 28:33.345
that fell behind your dresser.

28:34.106 --> 28:36.563
You are gonna want that one.

28:49.649 --> 28:51.867
_

29:00.474 --> 29:03.909
Henry... what's going on?

29:06.860 --> 29:08.293
Oh!

29:13.399 --> 29:15.732
Not "Henry," Lucy.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.923
Dad.

29:18.301 --> 29:19.925
You remember.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.892
Yeah.

29:20.928 --> 29:23.462
But... but how?

29:23.497 --> 29:25.831
I remember that call.

29:26.824 --> 29:29.801
I always remembered it. It was so weird.

29:30.885 --> 29:33.338
Because it was me.

29:33.373 --> 29:35.540
I'll explain everything. Okay?

29:35.826 --> 29:39.060
But right now I need to help my mom.

29:55.129 --> 29:57.528
You know, I thought you'd
bring more to the fight

29:57.553 --> 29:59.489
than a piece of dead wood.

29:59.514 --> 30:01.544
I've got nothin' left to lose.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.337
So let's do this.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.915
Thank you for saying you
wanted to leave early.

30:14.465 --> 30:17.359
I could not handle
another one of Grumpy's

30:17.384 --> 30:20.318
"To all the Curses I've
Known Before" toasts.

30:20.354 --> 30:21.887
Yeah... I was starting to think

30:21.922 --> 30:23.789
that wasn't hot chocolate in his mug.

30:24.519 --> 30:27.092
You seem different.

30:28.044 --> 30:29.600
What's changed?

30:30.185 --> 30:34.865
Mom, I wasn't entirely
honest with you or myself

30:34.890 --> 30:37.469
about why I couldn't pick a college.

30:37.873 --> 30:38.937
Really?

30:38.972 --> 30:41.303
When you told me that you
were ready to let me go,

30:41.408 --> 30:45.084
I realized I wasn't ready to leave.

30:45.443 --> 30:48.680
Storybrooke is the only
home I've ever known.

30:48.715 --> 30:52.583
And change is hard. And
the unknown is scary.

30:52.619 --> 30:54.152
But... now it's not?

30:54.187 --> 30:56.644
Oh, no. Still terrifying.

30:56.714 --> 31:00.625
But I know now that home isn't a place.

31:01.425 --> 31:03.394
It's the people you love.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.798
And even when I'm not in Storybrooke,

31:06.833 --> 31:09.901
Storybrooke will always be with me.

31:10.321 --> 31:12.804
Well, it sounds like
you made your decision.

31:12.839 --> 31:14.505
What's the lucky school?

31:14.541 --> 31:16.407
Let me guess... B.U.?

31:16.443 --> 31:18.309
No, USC.

31:18.345 --> 31:20.845
Madison? It's Madison, isn't it?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.380
You've always loved cheese...

31:22.415 --> 31:24.916
Why don't we talk about it tomorrow?

31:24.951 --> 31:26.117
G'night, Mom.

31:39.299 --> 31:41.599
That's the problem with humans.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.568
They don't know when to let go.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.005
Letting go has never been my thing.

32:11.798 --> 32:13.097
Mom!

32:14.401 --> 32:15.867
Hold on, Mom.

32:15.902 --> 32:17.135
I got you.

32:17.170 --> 32:18.770
I got you. It's okay.

32:18.805 --> 32:21.074
It's okay. I'm with you. I got you.

32:21.746 --> 32:23.541
Mom?

32:23.576 --> 32:25.076
Mom...

32:25.111 --> 32:27.145
I'm sorry it took me
so long, but I'm here.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.546
I remember.

32:28.581 --> 32:31.215
I finally remember everything.

32:31.939 --> 32:34.173
Please come back to me, Mom.

32:34.439 --> 32:36.408
Come back.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.157
I love you.

32:53.293 --> 32:55.073
Welcome back...

32:55.108 --> 32:57.008
Captain Hook.

32:58.511 --> 32:59.644
Crocodile.

33:06.686 --> 33:08.052
Robin!

33:08.088 --> 33:09.687
Tower Girl.

33:14.894 --> 33:16.494
I told you we'd always know each other.

33:16.529 --> 33:17.862
Mm!

33:31.411 --> 33:32.410
Henry?

33:32.445 --> 33:33.444
Yeah.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.246
You did it.

33:35.663 --> 33:37.973
You broke the curse.

33:53.431 --> 33:55.009
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.935
Oh, Henry. I'm just
glad to have you back.

34:00.140 --> 34:02.173
And my magic.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.812
It's not enough, Regina.

34:08.128 --> 34:09.594
Maybe.

34:10.483 --> 34:13.217
But perhaps your
daughter's magic will be.

34:13.253 --> 34:14.949
Gold.

34:14.975 --> 34:17.388
My daughter's with me now, Dark One.

34:17.668 --> 34:19.056
Come here, Tilly.

34:19.496 --> 34:20.958
She was never with you.

34:21.224 --> 34:23.427
And now she's gonna be
the one who stops you.

34:24.322 --> 34:25.702
What?

34:25.918 --> 34:27.384
No.

34:27.713 --> 34:29.800
I can't fight her. She's a monster.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.402
She's too strong.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.885
Not half as strong as you, Alice.

34:35.665 --> 34:36.596
Papa, please.

34:36.621 --> 34:38.275
I know you're afraid.

34:38.311 --> 34:40.277
You're hurting yourself.
You're growing weak.

34:40.313 --> 34:42.647
No, I'm finally growing strong.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.159
You make me stronger.

34:44.184 --> 34:47.552
Yet every step you take,
your heart grows weaker.

34:47.587 --> 34:50.721
You can do this.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.585
I'm here with you.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.119
And so am I.

34:59.032 --> 35:00.698
Don't be a fool.

35:00.733 --> 35:02.900
Join your mother and defend your home.

35:03.497 --> 35:05.336
You are not my mother.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.573
You want to ruin me the
way the world ruined you.

35:10.610 --> 35:12.560
But I'm not like you.

35:13.613 --> 35:16.380
I'm not an outcast.

35:16.416 --> 35:18.683
I'm not an orphan or a street rat

35:19.045 --> 35:21.245
or some crazy girl who's lost her way.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.612
You chose hate.

35:30.486 --> 35:32.753
But I choose love.

36:03.196 --> 36:05.052
I'm sorry your life
twisted into something

36:05.077 --> 36:06.410
you never meant it to.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.399
I promise I will do better.

36:10.323 --> 36:12.169
For everyone.

36:34.094 --> 36:36.261
Farewell, Gothel.

36:42.102 --> 36:43.744
Don't move, Facilier.

36:44.416 --> 36:47.138
Princess Tiana, I presume.

36:47.174 --> 36:48.840
It's Queen to you.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.947
Now that's the kick-ass
queen I remember.

36:55.982 --> 36:57.531
Naveen!

36:57.883 --> 37:00.872
I'm so sorry I couldn't save you before.

37:00.897 --> 37:02.420
Better late than never.

37:04.028 --> 37:05.394
Ella!

37:05.419 --> 37:07.018
Where are you running off to?

37:08.055 --> 37:09.922
To find my family.

37:13.839 --> 37:18.336
You were right... I did
stop believing in myself.

37:18.371 --> 37:20.472
I guess I got a little
dinged up along the way,

37:20.507 --> 37:22.307
and I couldn't recognize
who I was anymore.

37:22.342 --> 37:23.975
I know.

37:25.253 --> 37:27.746
Scratches are a part of life.

37:27.781 --> 37:29.781
I remember that now.

37:29.816 --> 37:32.250
I remember everything you taught me.

37:42.066 --> 37:43.377
Dear Mom,

37:43.402 --> 37:46.998
this is the personal essay I
wanted to send, but couldn't.

37:47.218 --> 37:50.301
It's titled "Once Upon A Time."

37:50.337 --> 37:53.037
And it's the story of us.

37:53.648 --> 37:56.843
Sometimes, you have to leave home.

37:57.053 --> 37:58.987
And you've been there for so long,

37:59.179 --> 38:03.067
you don't know who or what
you'll be outside of it.

38:03.092 --> 38:08.353
But then you realize...
every experience, every trial,

38:08.388 --> 38:11.489
every moment has shaped you.

38:11.525 --> 38:13.838
And you take that place with you

38:13.863 --> 38:15.705
no matter where you go next.

38:18.165 --> 38:22.100
I'm lucky. I have an incredible home.

38:22.135 --> 38:24.435
You won't find it on a map.

38:24.471 --> 38:27.438
But in it, you will find magic.

38:27.710 --> 38:29.382
You find love...

38:29.407 --> 38:30.663
hope...

38:30.688 --> 38:32.773
and something to believe in.

38:34.054 --> 38:37.348
You'll find a family that
fights for one another,

38:37.384 --> 38:39.951
who never gives up on each other.

38:39.986 --> 38:42.554
And even when they're separated by curse

38:42.589 --> 38:45.442
or distance or time...

38:47.651 --> 38:49.384
they find each other.

38:49.529 --> 38:52.397
They always find each other.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.486
I wish the world could know
the story of my family...

38:59.511 --> 39:03.174
how it was all true... how
every moment of it happened.

39:06.012 --> 39:08.780
And you may think this is just a story.

39:08.815 --> 39:11.482
But that's the thing about stories.

39:11.518 --> 39:13.585
They're more than words.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.297
They live inside of us.

39:15.322 --> 39:17.889
They make us who we are.

39:19.826 --> 39:22.904
And as long as someone believes that...

39:23.581 --> 39:26.582
there will always be magic.

39:57.430 --> 39:59.297
Facilier.

40:15.166 --> 40:17.066
I thought I'd lost you.

40:25.725 --> 40:27.659
I've tried, Belle,

40:28.107 --> 40:31.195
but I don't think I'm gonna
find my way home to you now.

40:31.873 --> 40:35.561
No, I don't think that you will...

40:35.586 --> 40:37.152
Dark One.

40:37.620 --> 40:40.638
How nice of you to pay me a visit.

40:40.674 --> 40:43.324
How dare you take what's mine!

40:44.540 --> 40:48.608
Remember, you're not the
only one with magic anymore.

41:01.565 --> 41:03.131
That's what I thought.

41:03.296 --> 41:05.830
You're a shadow of your former self.

41:05.865 --> 41:07.432
It's sad.

41:07.467 --> 41:08.998
Trying to get back to your beloved

41:09.023 --> 41:12.003
has made you the worst version of you.

41:19.722 --> 41:22.246
Well, I find that really insulting.

41:22.282 --> 41:24.482
I mean, I'm the worst version of me.

41:25.819 --> 41:27.352
Hello, Dearie!

41:27.387 --> 41:30.555
Did you really think a
wish realm could hold me?

41:30.836 --> 41:33.008
Now, then...

41:33.033 --> 41:37.169
it's time you and I
got better acquainted.
