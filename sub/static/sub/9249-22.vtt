00:00.702 --> 00:02.295
MIKE:
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:02.296 --> 00:04.313
MAN: Watch out!

00:05.868 --> 00:07.703
CARL:
<i>After that accident,</i>

00:07.704 --> 00:10.238
the one face that's been popping
up in my mind is Victoria's.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.973
Mike, I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

00:11.975 --> 00:14.175
MIKE:
<i>He's gonna propose to Victoria.</i>

00:14.177 --> 00:16.178
He's gonna propose?
I didn't say anything.

00:16.178 --> 00:18.012
You said exactly that!
I know, I know, I know!

00:18.014 --> 00:19.047
But don't tell anybody.
Don't tell anybody.

00:19.048 --> 00:20.147
He wants it to be a surprise.

00:20.149 --> 00:21.549
You got the ring?
What ring?

00:21.551 --> 00:23.751
The ring you're gonna use
to propose to Victoria with.

00:23.753 --> 00:26.321
I changed my mind.
That ain't happening.

00:26.322 --> 00:27.723
Man. I cannot decide
what I want.

00:27.724 --> 00:29.724
God, you make me sick.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.293
What is going on?

00:31.294 --> 00:32.259
Nothing, sweetie.

00:32.261 --> 00:34.362
Unfortunately,
nothing is going on.

00:34.363 --> 00:36.731
Isn't that right, Carl?

00:36.732 --> 00:37.999
Victoria,

00:38.000 --> 00:39.401
I love you.

00:39.402 --> 00:40.702
I mean, I-I really do.

00:40.703 --> 00:42.571
And, you know,
one day, who knows?

00:42.572 --> 00:44.706
You know, but whatever
you thought was happening,

00:44.707 --> 00:46.041
not gonna happen.

00:46.042 --> 00:48.209
Oh, thank goodness.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.210
What's that now?

00:50.212 --> 00:52.280
Getting my stuff
and I'm getting out of here.

00:52.281 --> 00:53.682
Go ahead, be a baby.

00:53.683 --> 00:55.216
Need help changing
your diaper?!

00:55.217 --> 00:57.751
CARL: Oh, no, don't try
and get sexy with me!

01:00.795 --> 01:02.557
MIKE:
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

01:02.558 --> 01:04.858
Yeah, about 30 people.
Saturday night.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.895
Okay, I'll e-mail you
my information.

01:06.896 --> 01:08.062
Thank you.

01:08.063 --> 01:09.063
Who was that?

01:09.064 --> 01:10.899
Ah, I've been
racking my brains

01:10.900 --> 01:12.165
trying to plan me and Molly's
anniversary party.

01:12.167 --> 01:13.735
Mm-hmm.
And then bam!

01:13.736 --> 01:15.803
A Dave & Buster's
commercial came on

01:15.804 --> 01:18.373
like a sign from God.

01:18.374 --> 01:21.943
God told you to have an
anniversary party at an arcade?

01:21.944 --> 01:24.111
And pub.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.582
Do you really think
Molly's idea of romance

01:27.583 --> 01:29.349
involves a plastic cup
full of tokens?

01:29.351 --> 01:31.786
It's not tokens, it's
a credit card that you sw...

01:31.787 --> 01:33.887
Have you not been there?

01:33.889 --> 01:35.923
Here's what you're gonna do:
you're gonna take Molly

01:35.924 --> 01:38.125
and your closest friends
on a moonlight dinner cruise

01:38.126 --> 01:39.192
of Lake Michigan.

01:39.194 --> 01:40.261
Okay? There's gonna be
some drinking,

01:40.262 --> 01:41.262
there's gonna be some dancing,

01:41.263 --> 01:42.630
and breathtaking views
of the city

01:42.631 --> 01:44.031
where you fell in love.

01:44.032 --> 01:46.366
Wow. That's good.

01:46.368 --> 01:48.369
Yeah. That's where
I was gonna take Victoria

01:48.370 --> 01:49.603
for our anniversary.

01:49.605 --> 01:51.472
Mm, sorry, buddy.
I feel for you.

01:51.473 --> 01:53.573
Hey, can you fish off that boat?

01:57.878 --> 01:59.245
Hey, Molly.

01:59.247 --> 02:01.983
Hey, Carl. Didn't think you'd...
still be here.

02:01.984 --> 02:04.951
Mike, I didn't think he'd still be here.
Yeah,

02:04.953 --> 02:06.854
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
the game was gonna go this long.

02:06.855 --> 02:09.122
(quietly): Can't you take Victoria around
the block a couple times?

02:09.124 --> 02:11.325
No, we already took
a couple extra hours at the spa.

02:11.326 --> 02:14.727
I've got stuff waxed
that shouldn't be waxed.

02:15.596 --> 02:16.964
Really?

02:16.965 --> 02:18.465
Just get him out.

02:18.466 --> 02:21.267
All right, hey, uh, Carl,
we got to wrap this up, buddy.

02:21.269 --> 02:23.470
How 'bout we listen to
the rest of the game in the car?

02:23.471 --> 02:24.605
What, basketball on the radio?

02:24.606 --> 02:26.440
That's just a bunch
of squeaky sneakers.

02:26.441 --> 02:28.241
You guys,

02:28.243 --> 02:30.044
I know Victoria's out
on the porch, all right?

02:30.045 --> 02:32.279
Just let her in.
We're both adults.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.548
No, you're not.

02:34.549 --> 02:36.784
I suppose this was gonna happen
at some point.

02:36.785 --> 02:38.752
What are you doing, silly?

02:38.753 --> 02:41.822
Oh. Hello.

02:41.823 --> 02:43.123
Victoria.

02:43.124 --> 02:45.025
Yeah. Uh, we were just going.

02:45.026 --> 02:46.860
Oh, you don't have
to go anywhere on my account.

02:46.861 --> 02:48.494
CARL:
See? We're fine.

02:48.496 --> 02:49.730
Let's just watch
the end of this game.

02:49.731 --> 02:51.698
And, Victoria, you
might want to join us.

02:51.699 --> 02:53.933
You like to play games.

02:54.935 --> 02:57.371
My favorite game was
Dump the Chump, so...

02:57.372 --> 02:58.372
Okay!

02:58.373 --> 02:59.640
Okay,

02:59.641 --> 03:01.641
we tried, we failed.

03:01.642 --> 03:03.743
Carl, maybe you should go.

03:03.745 --> 03:05.412
No, I'm here as a guest
of my best friend, all right?

03:05.413 --> 03:07.447
And if he wants me to leave,
he should just tell me himself.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.714
I want you to leave.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.785
No.
VICTORIA: Ugh.

03:12.787 --> 03:14.820
Why do you always to be
such a drama queen?

03:14.822 --> 03:17.489
(gasps)
Don't you dare call me that!

03:17.491 --> 03:19.592
I don't know
what I ever saw in you.

03:19.594 --> 03:20.894
You know what, well,
I got news for you, lady.

03:20.895 --> 03:22.596
You're not the first
woman to say that.

03:22.597 --> 03:24.531
You're an awful man!

03:24.532 --> 03:25.598
And you're a crazy woman!

03:25.600 --> 03:26.633
Ugh!
Okay! Okay!

03:26.634 --> 03:28.101
You get yours,
I'll get mine!

03:28.102 --> 03:29.035
All right, let's go.

03:29.036 --> 03:30.036
Just call him Daddy...

03:30.037 --> 03:31.303
he'll do whatever you want!

03:32.572 --> 03:35.240
I don't want to hear any more!
Just get Daddy out of here.

04:06.806 --> 04:09.609
If you don't have plans
on Saturday,

04:09.610 --> 04:12.312
I thought maybe
I could blow your mind.

04:12.313 --> 04:13.780
By taking me

04:13.781 --> 04:19.052
to Dave & Buster's
for our anniversary?

04:19.053 --> 04:21.687
Aah!

04:21.689 --> 04:23.322
What?

04:23.324 --> 04:27.226
They called earlier to confirm.

04:27.228 --> 04:28.661
Ah, I forgot to cancel.

04:28.662 --> 04:31.396
We're-we're not actually going
to Dave & Buster's.

04:31.398 --> 04:33.966
Oh, thank God.

04:35.468 --> 04:38.771
But I seemed
on board though, right?

04:38.772 --> 04:41.808
For our anniversary, you, me,
and a group of our friends

04:41.809 --> 04:45.311
are gonna take a moonlit boat
tour of beautiful Lake Michigan

04:45.312 --> 04:48.680
with views of the city
we fell in love in.

04:48.682 --> 04:51.951
Get out of here.

04:51.952 --> 04:53.986
No, I will not.

04:53.987 --> 04:55.187
Oh, my God.

04:55.189 --> 04:56.322
I am blown away.

04:56.323 --> 04:58.957
And will you thank
whoever gave you that idea?

04:58.959 --> 05:01.127
It was Carl.

05:01.128 --> 05:02.528
But everything comes
with a price.

05:02.529 --> 05:05.497
He's singing "Isn't She Lovely"
for our first dance.

05:05.499 --> 05:07.733
Mike, do you think
it's really a good idea

05:07.734 --> 05:10.302
to have Carl and Victoria
at the same party?

05:10.304 --> 05:13.238
Well, not really. But what am I
supposed to do, uninvite him?

05:14.674 --> 05:16.775
Aw, come on!

05:16.777 --> 05:18.577
Well, what are we supposed
to do?

05:18.578 --> 05:21.881
I mean, the two of them?
Plus alcohol? On a boat?

05:21.882 --> 05:24.917
Did you not see
<i>The Poseidon Adventure?</i>

05:24.918 --> 05:26.485
We're gonna be upside down

05:26.486 --> 05:30.255
and climbing up a Christmas tree
before we know it.

05:30.257 --> 05:31.990
He was my best man.

05:31.992 --> 05:33.525
She's my sister.

05:33.527 --> 05:35.828
(sighs) Mol, you just don't
understand the kind of position

05:35.829 --> 05:37.062
you're gonna put me in.

05:37.063 --> 05:38.196
I do.

05:38.198 --> 05:39.465
It's an awful one.

05:39.466 --> 05:41.267
But tell him that we'll do
something together,

05:41.268 --> 05:42.934
just the three of us.

05:42.936 --> 05:45.937
Dave & Buster's?

05:45.939 --> 05:48.473
Yeah. Just the two of you.

05:48.475 --> 05:51.409
Yeah. Go.

06:04.123 --> 06:06.791
Hey, don't worry.
I'll be ready when we set sail.

06:06.793 --> 06:08.694
Yeah.

06:08.695 --> 06:10.895
Listen, Carl, um...
Mm-hmm.

06:12.731 --> 06:15.167
You remember
when you were picking players

06:15.168 --> 06:16.835
for the precinct
softball team,

06:16.836 --> 06:20.905
and when you didn't pick me, you
asked me to take it like a man?

06:20.907 --> 06:22.774
Mm-hmm. That was right
before you ripped up home plate

06:22.775 --> 06:24.141
and threw it at my head.

06:24.143 --> 06:29.146
But eventually I understood,
'cause it was good for the team.

06:29.148 --> 06:30.348
It was good for you, too.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.017
I mean, you may be built
like Babe Ruth,

06:32.018 --> 06:33.818
but you play like Dr. Ruth.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.787
Ha-ha! Dr. Ruth.

06:35.788 --> 06:36.788
That's a good one.

06:36.789 --> 06:39.056
You can't come to the party.

06:39.058 --> 06:41.659
Excuse me, what?

06:41.661 --> 06:45.497
Molly and I...
especially Molly...

06:45.498 --> 06:47.699
think it's a good idea
that you don't go

06:47.700 --> 06:49.333
since Victoria's
gonna be there.

06:49.335 --> 06:51.303
H-Hold on now. If you're talking
about what happened yesterday,

06:51.304 --> 06:52.570
that was not my fault.

06:52.571 --> 06:54.539
Okay, you heard her
when she walked in there.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.541
(mocking):
"Hello."

06:56.542 --> 06:58.676
I'm supposed to ignore all that?

06:58.678 --> 07:00.578
Well, look, I'm sorry.
You're out!

07:00.579 --> 07:02.280
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
(sighs)

07:02.281 --> 07:04.883
I basically introduced you two,
made you ask her out,

07:04.884 --> 07:06.451
and this whole party is my idea.

07:06.452 --> 07:08.051
Without me,
there is no Mike and Molly!

07:08.053 --> 07:09.554
I know.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.756
And I'm asking you,
as my best friend,

07:11.757 --> 07:14.691
please just let this one go.

07:14.693 --> 07:16.394
(sighs)

07:16.395 --> 07:18.395
Is that what you really want?

07:18.397 --> 07:19.998
No!

07:19.999 --> 07:23.667
But it's what
I need you to do.

07:23.669 --> 07:25.136
All right.

07:25.137 --> 07:26.837
Consider it done.

07:26.839 --> 07:30.141
Thank you.
You're a good friend.

07:30.142 --> 07:31.675
(sighs)

07:33.511 --> 07:35.713
(sniffles)

07:35.714 --> 07:38.648
(voice breaking):
♪ Isn't she lovely ♪

07:40.518 --> 07:41.853
(sniffles)

07:41.854 --> 07:45.822
♪ Isn't she wonderful... ♪

07:47.892 --> 07:50.228
Okay, not that
it's a competition,

07:50.229 --> 07:54.531
but I call Mike's anniversary
cruise, and I raise it with...

07:54.533 --> 07:56.000
this. Ta-da!

07:56.001 --> 07:57.200
Oh, my God.

07:57.202 --> 07:59.537
It's beautiful!

07:59.538 --> 08:01.371
What the hell is it?

08:01.373 --> 08:03.507
It's a window
into our relationship.

08:03.508 --> 08:04.842
I mean, these are the tickets

08:04.843 --> 08:06.643
from the first Cubs game
we ever saw.

08:06.645 --> 08:07.978
This is our wedding invitation.

08:07.979 --> 08:10.915
This is an actual page
out of Mike's police notebook

08:10.916 --> 08:12.448
when he first asked me out.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.752
Oh, he's so lucky
you're a hoarder.

08:15.754 --> 08:16.887
I'm not a hoarder.

08:16.888 --> 08:21.024
I'm a romantic
with hoarding tendencies.

08:21.026 --> 08:22.760
I can't believe you and Mike
have been married

08:22.761 --> 08:24.894
for three years already.
I know.

08:24.896 --> 08:27.030
And I can remember
our first date.

08:27.032 --> 08:29.565
Oh, I was so sick.
I got hopped up on liquor

08:29.567 --> 08:32.467
and cough syrup,
and I threw up all over his car.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.102
And he asked you
on a second date.

08:34.105 --> 08:36.639
That's when I knew I had him.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.110
It's hard to find
something special like that.

08:40.111 --> 08:43.813
But when you do,
hold on to it.

08:43.815 --> 08:44.815
Yeah.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.516
Oh, sweetie.

08:46.517 --> 08:48.951
You have so
much to offer.

08:48.953 --> 08:50.220
Thanks, Mom.

08:50.221 --> 08:52.555
Any man would be
lucky to have you.

08:52.557 --> 08:54.457
Or woman.

08:56.493 --> 08:58.228
Now, my friend Janice
has a daughter.

08:58.229 --> 09:00.163
Very successful
pediatrician.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.299
At least have coffee.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.666
See where it goes.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.336
Might as well.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.237
Couldn't hurt. Yeah.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.944
Ramirez!

09:14.946 --> 09:15.912
So glad you could make it.

09:15.913 --> 09:17.413
We're upstairs
on the Topaz Deck.

09:17.415 --> 09:19.282
All right. Open bar?
How long have you known me?

09:19.283 --> 09:20.750
Long enough to
bring my own flask.

09:20.751 --> 09:22.017
Attaboy.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.019
Hello, Michael!

09:24.021 --> 09:25.422
Aw, Nana.

09:25.423 --> 09:27.123
(chuckles)
Mmm.

09:27.124 --> 09:28.792
Hey, thank you so much
for coming.

09:28.793 --> 09:31.628
I hope you understand
why I couldn't invite Carl.

09:31.629 --> 09:33.997
Of course I do!
This is your night.

09:33.998 --> 09:35.999
And we all know what
Carl can be like.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.635
A grown-up party is no place
for a 12-year-old girl.

09:41.371 --> 09:42.471
SAMUEL:
Ah.

09:42.473 --> 09:43.473
Congratulations.

09:43.474 --> 09:45.274
Thank you.

09:47.143 --> 09:49.112
Seriously? A life vest?

09:49.113 --> 09:51.980
I'm sorry, I thought
we were on a boat.

09:53.149 --> 09:54.751
Happy anniversary, Mike.

09:54.752 --> 09:56.151
Two tickets to <i> Wicked.</i>

09:56.153 --> 09:57.453
Wow, hey, thanks, Harry.

09:57.454 --> 09:59.187
Molly's been wanting
to see that show.

09:59.189 --> 10:00.189
Oh.

10:00.190 --> 10:01.124
Sure, Molly.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.625
Yeah, I can see it
another time.

10:06.029 --> 10:07.797
This is a
beautiful venue.

10:07.798 --> 10:09.532
Yeah.
You really went all out.

10:09.533 --> 10:10.900
High-class,
all the way.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.467
It's a cash bar,
deal with it.

10:16.072 --> 10:17.673
Carl, what the hell
are you doing here?

10:17.674 --> 10:19.708
You promised me you weren't coming.
I did.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.509
But time has passed,
and things have changed.

10:21.511 --> 10:22.544
Who's this?

10:22.546 --> 10:24.213
Allow me to introduce you
to Stephanie.

10:24.214 --> 10:25.548
I pulled her off Craigslist.

10:25.549 --> 10:26.748
Hi.

10:29.619 --> 10:30.953
Please don't do this.

10:30.954 --> 10:32.321
I'm not doing anything
but enjoying

10:32.322 --> 10:33.956
a moonlit cruise
on Lake Michigan.

10:33.957 --> 10:35.491
And until we cross
into Canadian waters,

10:35.492 --> 10:37.492
this is still a free country.

10:37.494 --> 10:39.928
You know what's gonna happen
when Victoria spots you?

10:39.930 --> 10:41.931
Well, I don't know exactly,
but for the amount of money

10:41.932 --> 10:43.865
I paid on Stephanie,
I hope her head explodes.

10:47.903 --> 10:49.605
I see the entertainment
has arrived.

10:49.606 --> 10:50.905
(groans)

10:50.907 --> 10:54.442
Eight dollars for rum and Coke
suddenly seems like a bargain.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:09.315 --> 11:10.916
This is so romantic.

11:10.918 --> 11:13.553
You're lucky you got somebody
to share this with, Mom.

11:13.554 --> 11:15.655
Aw, honey, I know
you're disappointed,

11:15.656 --> 11:17.589
but you're gonna find somebody.

11:17.591 --> 11:19.391
Probably when you
least expect it.

11:19.393 --> 11:21.361
Look at your mother and me.

11:21.362 --> 11:23.730
Who knew a sloppy drunken
one-night stand

11:23.731 --> 11:25.398
would turn into forever?

11:25.399 --> 11:27.267
Not me, that's for sure.

11:27.268 --> 11:30.403
I woke up next to this one and
thought, "What have I done""

11:30.404 --> 11:31.704
(chuckles)

11:31.705 --> 11:34.072
"And who still has a water bed""

11:34.074 --> 11:36.975
Say what you want,
but that bed did half the work.

11:37.810 --> 11:40.146
Point is, love is tricky.

11:40.147 --> 11:41.713
You can't go looking for it.

11:41.715 --> 11:43.583
Then how am I gonna find it?

11:43.584 --> 11:46.284
You don't.
It finds you.

11:47.787 --> 11:49.788
Is it here now?

11:49.790 --> 11:52.091
It was, till you just asked.

11:52.092 --> 11:54.994
Now it's gone again,
till you forget about it.

11:54.995 --> 11:57.262
Have you not heard
a word we've said?

11:58.097 --> 12:00.298
This is all very confusing.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.300
Exactly.

12:01.301 --> 12:02.467
That's love.

12:03.936 --> 12:05.905
Three years married.

12:05.906 --> 12:09.608
That's right around the time
Mike's dad first cheated on me.

12:09.609 --> 12:12.678
You sure you don't want to save
that story for your toast?

12:12.679 --> 12:14.546
Mm.

12:14.548 --> 12:16.048
I should've known
something was up

12:16.049 --> 12:18.083
when he switched
to colored underwear.

12:18.084 --> 12:20.019
I guess what I'm saying is

12:20.020 --> 12:23.788
Mike knows the warning signs,
so watch your step.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.623
Hey, Ma.

12:25.625 --> 12:28.159
Check her underwear
to see what color it is.

12:30.963 --> 12:32.598
Listen...
No, you listen.

12:32.599 --> 12:34.967
You did it... this
party is amazing.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.635
And the bartender
knows I'm the bride,

12:36.636 --> 12:38.270
so I keep getting
free drinks.

12:38.271 --> 12:39.705
(laughs)

12:39.706 --> 12:41.173
Maybe you want to take it easy.

12:41.174 --> 12:43.107
We might have to keep
our wits about us.

12:43.109 --> 12:44.743
Oh, no.

12:44.744 --> 12:47.713
Is this some kind of
murder-mystery cruise?

12:47.714 --> 12:50.782
Mike, you were
doing so well.

12:50.784 --> 12:52.383
No, Carl's on the boat.

12:52.385 --> 12:53.684
What?
And he brought a date.

12:53.686 --> 12:55.420
What?
And I dropped my phone in the toilet,

12:55.421 --> 12:58.022
but Carl is the main problem.

12:58.024 --> 12:59.524
Well, you got to
get him out of here

12:59.525 --> 13:02.261
before Victoria sees him.
We're in the middle of a lake.

13:02.262 --> 13:03.661
What do you want me to do?
Push him overboard?

13:03.663 --> 13:05.030
There are a lot of
boats out there.

13:05.031 --> 13:06.597
Somebody's gonna
pick him up.

13:06.599 --> 13:08.533
Molly.
Fine.

13:08.534 --> 13:11.569
Give him a flashlight
and a whistle.

13:12.504 --> 13:14.372
Hey, Harry.

13:14.373 --> 13:15.707
Have you seen Victoria?

13:15.708 --> 13:17.174
No, I have not.

13:17.176 --> 13:19.543
And you're not supposed
to be here.

13:19.545 --> 13:21.947
Shouldn't you be floating out
in the darkness or somewhere,

13:21.948 --> 13:23.681
waiting for a ship to hit you?

13:23.683 --> 13:27.885
Haven't you hurt
enough people today?

13:30.088 --> 13:31.589
Charmed.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.794
You know something, it might be
the three margaritas,

13:35.795 --> 13:37.695
but I'm feeling much better.

13:37.696 --> 13:39.029
Aw, see?

13:39.031 --> 13:41.800
I don't know why they say
alcohol's a depressant.

13:41.801 --> 13:43.134
It fixes everything.

13:43.135 --> 13:44.436
Mm-hmm.

13:44.437 --> 13:45.570
Listen, Victoria.

13:45.571 --> 13:47.004
We-we may have a
bit of a situation.

13:47.006 --> 13:48.939
(Carl whoops,
dance music playing)

13:49.974 --> 13:51.942
(grunting rhythmically)

13:52.777 --> 13:54.812
(whoops)

13:54.814 --> 13:57.247
I'm sorry, he wasn't
supposed to come.

13:57.249 --> 13:59.250
Don't worry, I'll go
get rid of the two of them.

13:59.251 --> 14:00.585
No, you won't.

14:00.586 --> 14:02.052
I'll handle this.

14:02.054 --> 14:03.521
Ah, that's my girl.

14:03.522 --> 14:05.857
Get her to the ground,
put her in a camel clutch.

14:05.858 --> 14:07.225
End this quick
so we can get back

14:07.226 --> 14:08.792
to your sister's
nice party.

14:13.297 --> 14:15.532
Hey, Carl.

14:15.534 --> 14:19.970
I hope you have a wonderful
time at the party.

14:21.472 --> 14:23.841
See, that's how
we Flynn girls do it.

14:23.842 --> 14:25.476
Pure class.

14:25.477 --> 14:26.977
Jackass.

14:28.312 --> 14:30.247
Unbelievable.

14:32.450 --> 14:34.618
Ah, best drink ever.

14:40.591 --> 14:43.227
Okay, everybody,
come on, gather round.

14:43.228 --> 14:45.829
It's time for Mike
to open his present.

14:45.831 --> 14:47.998
Been wanting to get you
something that, you know,

14:47.999 --> 14:50.501
is from the heart and shows you
how much I love you.

14:50.502 --> 14:52.202
Aw, thank you, sweetie.

14:52.204 --> 14:54.872
All right, it's...

14:54.873 --> 14:57.207
an old window!

14:57.208 --> 14:58.509
I love it.

14:58.510 --> 15:00.143
Turn it over.
Over.

15:01.245 --> 15:02.580
Aw...

15:02.581 --> 15:04.248
It's stuff
from our life together.

15:04.249 --> 15:06.083
Yeah, Cubbies tickets.

15:06.084 --> 15:08.118
And, oh, there's the
"Do Not Disturb" sign

15:08.119 --> 15:09.586
from that hotel
where we first...

15:09.587 --> 15:11.921
Okay.
Okay, a lot of good memories.

15:11.923 --> 15:13.490
You like it?

15:13.491 --> 15:14.491
I love it.

15:14.492 --> 15:15.526
And I love you.

15:15.527 --> 15:17.494
I love you, too.

15:17.495 --> 15:18.528
All right.

15:18.530 --> 15:21.498
I would like to
say a few words.

15:21.499 --> 15:22.999
Oh, thanks.

15:25.135 --> 15:27.770
Four years, three months
and two days ago,

15:27.772 --> 15:31.808
I had no idea who the hell
I was or where I was going.

15:31.809 --> 15:34.912
And one day later,
all of that changed.

15:34.913 --> 15:36.513
'Cause I met a girl.

15:36.514 --> 15:40.082
And her only flaw
was her taste in men.

15:40.084 --> 15:41.450
(laughter)

15:41.452 --> 15:44.153
And I thank God
for that every day.

15:44.155 --> 15:46.456
I hope everyone here
is lucky enough

15:46.457 --> 15:50.093
to feel the way I feel at
least once in their life.

15:50.094 --> 15:52.329
Here is to love.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.397
ALL:
Aw...

15:54.398 --> 15:55.931
(applause)

16:00.403 --> 16:02.405
Did you have the
garlic prawns?

16:02.406 --> 16:03.973
No.
Good.

16:08.678 --> 16:10.714
Uh, as you probably
know by now,

16:10.715 --> 16:12.682
I did have the garlic prawns.

16:12.683 --> 16:15.184
But I sensed
this was my moment.

16:15.186 --> 16:17.619
Well, I'd hate to catch
what he just gave you.

16:17.621 --> 16:18.988
Don't worry,
uh, I'm very clean.

16:18.989 --> 16:21.390
No one has touched me
in three years.

16:21.392 --> 16:23.625
Well, let's
change that.

16:23.627 --> 16:24.860
Hey, get off
of her, man!

16:24.862 --> 16:26.496
Hey, hey, hey,
that's enough, Carl.

16:26.497 --> 16:28.331
Come here, come here.
What is wrong with you?

16:28.332 --> 16:30.832
Let go of me, man! Got nothing to do with you.
Hey, hey!

16:30.834 --> 16:32.901
(splash)

16:34.737 --> 16:35.971
You happy?!

16:35.973 --> 16:37.372
Now, how is this my fault?

16:37.374 --> 16:39.809
How is this your fault?
Because you made it about you.

16:39.810 --> 16:42.911
You're selfish, you're a baby,
and you're a crappy friend!

16:42.913 --> 16:44.247
Oh, I'm a crappy
friend, huh?

16:44.248 --> 16:45.581
None of this
would have happened

16:45.582 --> 16:46.882
if you just invited me,
but you didn't.

16:46.884 --> 16:49.252
You chose them over me
like you always do.

16:49.253 --> 16:51.353
Well, Victoria's family.

16:51.355 --> 16:53.256
Yeah, I thought I was family.

16:53.257 --> 16:55.323
Honestly, I don't know
what you are right now.

16:55.325 --> 16:57.392
Mike, it's okay.

16:57.394 --> 16:59.428
No, it's not.
He ruined everything.

16:59.429 --> 17:02.031
All our memories are at the
bottom of Lake Michigan.

17:02.032 --> 17:04.400
Hey, we'll make more, okay?

17:04.401 --> 17:06.402
We don't need a bunch
of stuff in an old window

17:06.403 --> 17:07.636
to prove what we've got.

17:07.637 --> 17:11.272
Come on, let the bride
get you a drink.

17:14.510 --> 17:16.444
So was all that just...?

17:16.445 --> 17:18.680
Okay, that's
what I thought.

17:30.657 --> 17:32.424
I haven't seen Carl yet.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.394
No,<i> he's</i> apologizing this time,

17:34.395 --> 17:37.430
and he'd better have a scone
in his hand when he does it.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.299
Hey, uh, what do you say
this weekend,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.634
we go down to that little hotel
and see if we can't

17:41.635 --> 17:45.138
earn ourselves another
"Do Not Disturb" sign?

17:45.139 --> 17:47.173
And Dave & Buster's?

17:47.174 --> 17:48.808
God, I love you.

17:48.809 --> 17:50.476
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

17:50.477 --> 17:52.711
Okay, love you, bye.

17:52.713 --> 17:54.913
Hey, Biggs.

17:55.982 --> 17:57.516
Ramirez, what are you doing?

17:57.518 --> 17:59.385
Oh, you didn't hear?
Carl requested a transfer.

17:59.386 --> 18:01.754
He already cleared
his locker out.

18:01.755 --> 18:03.756
What are you
talking about?

18:03.757 --> 18:05.223
I'm your new partner.

18:05.225 --> 18:06.826
Buckle up, big guy.

18:06.827 --> 18:09.161
I've got rules in my squad car.
