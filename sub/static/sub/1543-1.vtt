WEBVTT

00:16.280 --> 00:17.441
We're in this together.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.887
No!

00:29.200 --> 00:32.522
How's that stolen grace
inside you working out?

00:35.200 --> 00:36.964
It's the bloody mark of Cain.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.681
Magic that powerful comes at a price.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.564
And we don't know what that price is.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.171
Drop the blade.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.610
First time I touched that blade,
I knew I wouldn't be stopped.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.849
I'm starting to think the blade
is doing something to you.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.244
No!

01:32.040 --> 01:36.011
Open your eyes, Dean.
Let's go take a howl at that moon.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.810
I heard the rumors.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.566
I said, "No, that can't be.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.003
A Winchester? One of us?"

01:51.200 --> 01:54.886
Heh. But it's true, isn't it?

01:55.080 --> 01:57.321
Whatever soul you had...

01:57.520 --> 02:01.730
...whatever Boy Scout code
you cuddled up to at night...

02:01.920 --> 02:04.082
...it's all gone.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.089
Leaving what?

02:06.280 --> 02:08.247
Look at you.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.527
Where is Crowley?

02:18.680 --> 02:19.841
Eat me.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.371
One more time.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.688
Where is Crowley?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.681
- Where's my brother?
- I don't know!

02:38.480 --> 02:40.562
Then you're gonna call
somebody who does.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.770
No one knows.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.849
- They won't answer.
- Make the call.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.361
- We're under orders.
- Make the call!

02:49.600 --> 02:51.841
Please.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.365
Where's my brother?!

03:11.960 --> 03:16.488
Right. So no noticeable crop failures,
no mass cattle deaths, nothing.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.207
Nothing new on the radar, nothing on
the scope. I'd say that's a good thing.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.406
Yeah, you're right. I hear you, Mike.
Thanks. That is a good thing.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.691
All right, well, keep me posted
if anything does pop up.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.283
- All right. Watch yourself, Sam.
- Yeah, I will. You got it. Thanks.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.371
Heh.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.970
Sam, hello.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.162
- I might have found something.
- Oh, good.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.323
Good. Ahem.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.410
Cass, you there?

05:10.600 --> 05:15.288
- It's okay. I'm okay. Uh, go on.
- Okay, get this.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.051
A John Doe who was murdered
in Wisconsin a week ago...

05:18.240 --> 05:21.722
...turns out to be this guy named
Drew Neely who went missing from...

05:21.960 --> 05:24.850
...some religious order
in northern Ohio, okay?

05:25.040 --> 05:29.250
- Yeah.
- Drew Neely has been missing for three years.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.161
Killed his wife, his kids.
Just disappeared.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.805
I know it's thin...

05:35.000 --> 05:38.561
...but if this guy was possessed...
- Well, that would make him the first...

05:41.440 --> 05:44.284
The first lead, the first anything
we've seen in...

05:47.800 --> 05:49.325
Sorry.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.851
Actually, you know what?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.725
Now that I'm looking at this more,
I think I, uh...

05:53.920 --> 05:57.527
- I think I jumped the gun here, buddy.
- No, Sam, you said it was something.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.085
Yeah. Uh...

05:59.280 --> 06:01.089
it's... It's not.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.123
I was wrong. Sorry.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.084
- I can help.
- Cass...

06:05.960 --> 06:08.406
...we tried that.
- Sam, you can't...

06:08.600 --> 06:11.206
...blame what that demon did
to your shoulder on me.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.084
- You were out of...
- I'm not, okay.

06:13.280 --> 06:18.127
I'm not blaming anything on you.
What happened, happened. And...

06:21.440 --> 06:24.523
You need to be worrying about yourself.
I really shouldn't have bothered you.

06:26.880 --> 06:31.841
- How are you, Sam?
- Good. I'm all right. I'm just tired, you know.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.728
Be better when we get him back...

06:34.920 --> 06:36.843
...after I kick his butt.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.200
I miss him.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.325
Yeah.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.650
Why would he just disappear?

06:46.840 --> 06:50.083
- Who says he had a choice?
- Well, then who wrote the note?

06:51.760 --> 06:53.285
You think there's any chance...

06:53.480 --> 06:59.169
...any chance at all that Dean is still...?
- Still even remotely Dean?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.161
I'm too sexy for my love

07:22.360 --> 07:26.046
Too sexy for my love
Love's going to leave me

07:27.360 --> 07:30.887
- And I'm too sexy for my shirt
Oh, my ears are bleeding.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.242
- Hang it up.
- So sexy it hurts

07:35.480 --> 07:37.881
And I'm too sexy for Milan

07:38.080 --> 07:41.129
Too sexy for Milan, New York and Japan

07:41.320 --> 07:43.926
Dude, who told you you can sing?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.680
- Turn it off!
- Get off the stage.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.847
Everybody.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.970
Okay.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.804
Wow.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.241
What time is it? Darryl's gonna kill me
if I'm late for my break again.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.211
Oops.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.129
Damn.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.764
Told you to hurry it up.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.890
Then you had to go
and do that thing with the thing.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.242
Oh, you mean that thing
that you were begging me for?

08:14.040 --> 08:15.769
Begging you to hurry it up, maybe.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.442
Well, let's not argue about good sex.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.646
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Mm-hm.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.850
Just, uh...

08:27.040 --> 08:30.203
...don't get too excited, you know...

08:30.440 --> 08:33.649
...or too attached,
because I'm just rolling through.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.525
You know...

08:37.720 --> 08:40.883
...there's about a million other ways
you could have said that.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.565
Whoa.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.365
"Whoa"? What's going on here?

08:50.560 --> 08:52.688
- What's it look like?
- In my bed?

08:52.920 --> 08:54.160
What?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.489
Oh, yeah.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.402
- Jerk.
- Bitch.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.769
- Get a room, you two.
- Had a room until you two soiled it.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.801
Love you, Crowley.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.526
Love you more, sweetheart.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.929
- Anne Marie, jackass.
- Knew that.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.531
Pants?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.282
Best of three.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.091
Losers buy the beer.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.520
Lots of beer.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.362
Girl seemed nice. Ungh!

09:34.560 --> 09:38.167
Slightly damaged.
I could see the old you falling for that.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.443
Yeah, well, not to worry.
She means nothing.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.011
Good. Good.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.806
You and I, we're rolling stones.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.281
No distractions.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.488
- Knock it down. Knock it down.
- Stop talking.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.806
You're bodging it.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.082
- Yeah!
- Would you shut up?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.482
Keep talking, I can't play the game.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.442
- Let's go. Come on, let's go.
- Hang on.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.560
- Get off me.
- Why are you doing this to me?

10:06.680 --> 10:08.842
- You need to calm down. Stop it.
- Where were you?

10:09.080 --> 10:10.889
- Is this him?
- There a problem?

10:11.080 --> 10:12.889
- Hey, you Matt?
- Ungh!

10:13.080 --> 10:14.525
Dean.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.844
You need to get away from here.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.089
Don't try and contact her.
In fact, don't even think about her.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.645
You understand me?

10:58.520 --> 11:00.363
Just a moment.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.602
- Castiel.
- Hannah.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.523
I'm sensing awkwardness.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.011
So...

11:27.240 --> 11:29.766
...there's no leader,
you're governing yourselves?

11:30.520 --> 11:32.090
Mostly.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.011
There's lots of meeting
on rebuilding and reorganization.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.965
- Lots of reconciliation.
- And Metatron?

11:38.440 --> 11:39.885
Still in jail.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.526
His door has been made permanent.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.248
I would've thought we'd see you sooner.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.808
- I would've come sooner, but...
- I'm glad you didn't.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.486
You see...

11:54.240 --> 11:55.571
...I need your help.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.127
Heaven needs your help.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.725
Anything.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.289
Most of the angels who fell
during the fall have returned to heaven.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.561
A few have not.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.648
Some out-and-out refuse. Rogues.

12:11.440 --> 12:16.128
Two of them have killed one of our own for
only attempting to bring them back home.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.971
- Who were they?
- Daniel and Adina.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.851
They must be found.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.761
They must be brought home, and they
must be punished, for the sake of all.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.166
Will you help me?

12:31.640 --> 12:33.210
Yes.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.884
Appreciate you coming down, agent.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.970
But I'm afraid you may
have just cost Uncle Sam a tank of gas.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.367
- Why's that?
- You came up here to investigate...

12:45.560 --> 12:47.528
- ...Drew Neely's murder, right?
- Right.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.929
Problem is no one's certain
it was a murder at all.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.642
- What are we dealing with here? A suicide?
- Self-defense, more likely.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.522
The surveillance footage was corrupted.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.486
Our techies finally managed
to clean up the file.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.091
Hold on a sec now.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.406
We can do this however you want.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.249
Don't pretend
I didn't see you this afternoon.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.331
Did you get a good look?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.807
See my moves?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.482
I hope so,
because I sure could use the competition.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.244
That John Doe right there
you want to keep your eye on.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.244
Son of a bitch.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.601
Watch.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.923
All you Abaddon groupers are the same,
you know that?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.691
You, the douche that jumped me
at the gas station...

13:50.880 --> 13:53.611
...you just can't accept
that the queen is dead, can you?

13:53.800 --> 13:57.646
Maybe we just can't accept that a douche
like you was the one who killed her.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.046
Ah.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.083
Yeah, that's gotta hurt, doesn't it?

14:07.040 --> 14:10.522
Okay, now,
porn guy is just minding his own business.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.648
- And there's Drew Neely. See the knife?
- Yeah.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.287
That's intent right there.
Now watch this.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.808
Looks like a cutlass or something.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.286
I don't know what the hell this is.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.123
Problem is we don't know
if this guy's a hero or a psychopath.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.882
That's the image
that's getting uploaded to the wires.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.651
Detective, do you mind
if, uh, I take another look at this?

15:00.840 --> 15:04.561
- Knock yourself out. Be back in a few.
- Right.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.285
Fax, Dad.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.291
- Who's it from, buddy?
- Doesn't say. There's a picture.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.682
Thanks a lot, bud.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.330
Is it him?

17:34.120 --> 17:38.170
- I didn't know angels could get nauseous.
- I just need a moment.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.689
It's my fault.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.167
I'll take the curves faster.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.050
And you, Castiel?

17:49.520 --> 17:52.603
- You're feeling well?
- Oh, yes.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.683
Like a million dollars.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.486
- That's not true.
- It's my truth.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.081
When you left heaven,
your borrowed grace was failing.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.045
- By the looks of you, you've only gotten worse.
- I'm fine.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.846
You're dying, Castiel.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.204
- You need more grace.
- We have a mission in front of us...

18:15.440 --> 18:17.522
...that supersedes my needs.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.882
All of our needs, don't you agree?

18:26.360 --> 18:28.761
You're a good soldier, Hannah.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.289
One of the best.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.121
Metatron certainly could not have been
brought to heel without your bravery.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.049
Or yours.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.971
You must take care of yourself, Castiel.

18:41.800 --> 18:47.125
And another angel should die,
so that I can be saved?

18:47.320 --> 18:49.721
Is this really that hard to understand?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.804
Hannah.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.047
I'm feeling better now.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.731
Oh, yeah. Porn guy was an animal.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.571
Bro came at him like, "What."
And he was all like, "What."

19:08.920 --> 19:11.241
Say my name. Say my name!

19:11.440 --> 19:13.408
Say my name.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.087
There was a lot of blood.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.886
Right.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.491
Um...

19:23.720 --> 19:26.644
When the guy, uh... When... Ahem. When...

19:27.320 --> 19:30.881
..."porn guy" came in,
did he say anything?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.125
"Where's the porn?"

19:35.240 --> 19:37.163
That's all he said?

19:38.880 --> 19:41.281
Did he buy anything?
Did he use a credit card?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.041
Nothing.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.443
So some guy comes in, kills another guy
in your store, on your watch...

19:48.640 --> 19:51.291
...and you just... You what?
Keep on keeping on?

19:51.480 --> 19:55.451
You mean when porn guy was stabbing the other
guy to death 10 feet in front of me...

19:55.640 --> 19:57.369
...and I was having a code-brown moment...

19:57.560 --> 20:00.803
...in my favorite freaking pants
because I thought I was next?

20:01.720 --> 20:04.087
Did I conduct a field interview?

20:05.400 --> 20:06.970
No.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.123
Oh, hey, uh, can you do me a solid?

20:13.120 --> 20:14.929
Found this wedged under the teepee.

20:15.120 --> 20:19.648
I think it's the dead guy's phone, and
if you're heading back to the station...

20:40.640 --> 20:43.883
- You're dead.
- Nope.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.890
- Just using a dead man's phone.
- Moose.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.320
Took you long enough.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.844
Your brother and I were beginning to wonder
if you'd hit another dog, you know.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.849
My brother is dead, Crowley.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.205
I know you have...

20:59.440 --> 21:02.649
...some demon parading around
in his meat suit, and trust me...

21:02.840 --> 21:05.650
...you are gonna pay for that.
- Moose, Moose...

21:05.840 --> 21:09.970
...I'm afraid you haven't allowed yourself
to dream quite big enough here.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.171
Your brother is very much alive,
courtesy of the mark.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.322
The only demonized soul inside
of Dean is his and his alone.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.601
Wee bit more twisted...

21:19.840 --> 21:22.446
...a little more mangled
beyond human recognition...

21:22.640 --> 21:26.531
...but I can assure you, all his.
There now, feel better?

21:26.760 --> 21:30.481
And the, uh, Abaddon supporters
you've been sending to kill my brother?

21:30.720 --> 21:32.404
How does Dean feel
about that double cross?

21:32.640 --> 21:36.008
If that's what you think, then you're
more out of your depths than I thought.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.168
I don't know how you did this...

21:38.400 --> 21:42.564
...what kind of black-magic
stunt you pulled.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.285
But hear me...

21:44.480 --> 21:46.369
...I will save my brother...

21:46.560 --> 21:47.686
...or die trying.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.884
You know what tickles me about all this?

21:51.480 --> 21:54.370
It's what's really eating you up.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.210
You don't care that he's a demon.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.687
Heck, you've been a demon.
We've all been demons.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.685
No, it's that he's with me...

22:01.920 --> 22:06.289
...and he's having the time of his life.
You can't stand the fact that he's mine.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.448
- He's not your pet.
- My pet?

22:08.680 --> 22:10.364
He's my best friend.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.245
My partner in crime.
They'll write songs about us.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.680
Graphic novels.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.531
The Misadventures of Crowley and Squirrel.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.041
Dean Winchester completes me...

22:20.240 --> 22:22.527
...and that's what makes you
lose your chickens.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.210
I am going to find you.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.286
I am going to save my brother...

22:28.480 --> 22:30.881
...and then I'm going to kill you dead.

22:31.080 --> 22:34.766
Well, that's the operative
phrase, isn't it? "Find you."

22:34.960 --> 22:37.088
Good luck with that.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.810
Daniel.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.728
What are you fishing for?

23:59.920 --> 24:02.048
Trout, mostly.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.043
We do love a good curly-tailed grub.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.366
Trick is to find that special spot,
just outside the run...

24:10.560 --> 24:12.244
...where the big ones...

24:12.440 --> 24:15.091
...the smart ones are holding low.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.291
Do they...? Do they put up much of a fight?

24:20.520 --> 24:23.649
The ones who truly want to be free...

24:25.840 --> 24:27.524
...they do.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.523
You're here about our brother who died.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.200
- Does that surprise you?
- I can assure you...

24:33.400 --> 24:36.165
...had he left us alone,
no one would have been harmed.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.170
His orders were to not leave you alone,
and you killed him.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.567
And heaven sends two more.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.004
What is it about us angels
that we can't seem to get the message?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.806
Perhaps it is you who has failed
to get the message.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.123
All of us serve at heaven's command.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.761
I suppose.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.888
But that was before the fall, wasn't it?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.205
You are an angel.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.210
- Once and forever.
- Dropped...

25:03.400 --> 25:05.209
...unwillingly...

25:05.440 --> 25:07.283
...unknowingly...

25:07.520 --> 25:09.010
...into a strange land.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.851
A land that as it turns out...

25:12.040 --> 25:16.329
...celebrates the free, the individual.

25:16.520 --> 25:20.844
For the first time
in thousands of years, I have choices.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.447
And with each choice...

25:24.240 --> 25:27.244
...I begin to discover who I really am...
- This is nonsense.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.410
Because they don't teach you this
in heaven? Perhaps they should.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.809
Then you would understand
why it's worth fighting for.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.090
He's taunting us.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.931
And then what? We kill him?

25:40.440 --> 25:42.442
Or he kills us?

25:42.680 --> 25:45.160
- There are orders.
- And there is time.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.491
- To hear more of this?
- To convince him.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.682
To do the right thing.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.564
Besides, Hannah...

25:52.760 --> 25:55.286
...we still don't even know
where the other one is.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.209
The woman.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.291
You'll have to stay for sunset.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.450
Nighttime around here is a revelation.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.120
You sent those demons? To kill me?

26:10.320 --> 26:12.607
To keep you sharp.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.126
Really?

26:14.320 --> 26:17.051
If it wasn't for me,
what do you think would have happened?

26:17.240 --> 26:18.969
The mark needs to be sated, otherwise...

26:19.160 --> 26:21.640
Otherwise I turn into a demon. Yeah.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.366
Yeah, I sort of got that six weeks ago.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.284
Just trying to help.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.924
- You lied.
- Who do you think you're talking to here?

26:31.120 --> 26:33.964
Does the Tin Man have a sheet-metal willy?
Of course I lied.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.449
Okay.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.322
Sit down. Sit.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.123
I needed to keep you sharp for our future,
about which we need to talk.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.482
- Our future?
- Professional future.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.965
How to put this.

26:54.160 --> 26:58.768
If I have to spend one more night in this
fetid petri dish of broken dreams and BO...

26:58.960 --> 27:00.689
...I will cut off my own face.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.962
I don't know what you're talking about...

27:03.160 --> 27:05.401
...because I'm good. Hell, I'm great.

27:05.640 --> 27:09.167
Really?
How many suicide wings can you eat?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.681
How many one-hit wonders
can you karaoke to death?

27:11.880 --> 27:14.565
Okay, see, the deal was...

27:14.760 --> 27:16.524
...we howl at the moon.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.486
No timestamp. No expiration date.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.603
We've howled. We've bayed.

27:22.800 --> 27:26.964
We've done extraordinary things to triplets,
all of which have been massively entertaining.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.168
I will treasure our Flickr albums forever.

27:29.360 --> 27:34.924
But now it's time for us to accept
what we are and go back to work.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.285
Pass.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.090
Think of it, the king of hell...

27:42.280 --> 27:46.171
...Dean Winchester by his side,
together we rule, together we create...

27:46.360 --> 27:48.362
...the perfect hell.

27:48.600 --> 27:53.322
And all of this that's bloomed
between us never ends.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.804
We're not ending the party.
We're just moving the party.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.483
Out with the club circuit,
in with the stadium tour.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.445
Oh.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.330
Did I forget to mention
I spoke to Moose earlier?

28:12.440 --> 28:13.680
What?

28:13.920 --> 28:17.049
Yes, apparently he's been tracking us
for some time now.

28:17.240 --> 28:21.040
He got my text from the cell of that demon
that you stabbed.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.050
Blah-blah-blah. It was...

28:24.960 --> 28:27.850
Words were spoken. Emotions.

28:28.320 --> 28:33.087
I realized, in retrospect,
perhaps too many words. Too many emotions.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.408
- He traced the call.
- My bad.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.763
I guess he'll be here by morning,
at the latest.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.089
You sold me out.
Well, that's just lovely.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.411
I don't know what's going on with you,
I truly don't...

28:48.600 --> 28:50.443
...but I've had just about enough of it.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.610
"Sold you out"? Try "doing you a favor."

28:53.800 --> 28:57.771
Everything I've done for you for the past
the mark, the first blade...

28:58.000 --> 29:01.766
...midwifing you back to life,
offering you a seat by my side, has been...

29:01.960 --> 29:06.249
...a favor, a gift,
whether you see it or you don't.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.169
Take the night.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.805
Decide.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
You know where to find me.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.570
Hey.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.361
- Need some help?
- Uh...

30:09.560 --> 30:12.450
Yeah, I think so. It just died on me.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.483
- Out here?
- Yeah.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.401
- Your ride really has it out for you, huh?
- I guess so.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.570
Give you a hand with that?

30:22.520 --> 30:25.251
- Yeah, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
- Yeah.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.720
Ugh. These new cars
and their computerized brains, huh?

30:30.920 --> 30:33.571
One zero out of place
and the whole thing just goes kaput.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.091
Heh.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.204
Well, right there. There's your problem.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.083
- What the hell is that?
- Well, that's a kill switch.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.930
This here's the remote.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.123
Guessing you're a righty.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.489
There you go.

31:06.440 --> 31:10.684
Imaginary lovers
Boo!

31:10.880 --> 31:13.804
Never turn you down

31:14.840 --> 31:17.411
- Enough!
- When all the others

31:17.640 --> 31:20.564
Turn you away
They're around

31:24.560 --> 31:27.291
It's my private pleasure

31:27.480 --> 31:31.804
- No more!
- Midnight fantasy

31:40.000 --> 31:41.161
You all suck.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.650
Get off the stage, jackass.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.804
Drink, tough guy.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.843
No, I'm good.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.569
Your funeral.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.366
Hm.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.490
What?

32:17.680 --> 32:20.570
We'll go somewhere, you and me.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.242
We are somewhere.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.771
No.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.964
Somewhere else.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.165
Sweetie...

32:31.360 --> 32:34.284
...we barely know each other,
and you're drunk.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.362
Yeah, but, uh...

32:39.560 --> 32:41.562
...I protected your honor, didn't I?

32:43.880 --> 32:45.166
Yeah...

32:45.400 --> 32:47.402
...I thought so too.

32:47.760 --> 32:51.890
Seeing you take on Matt, I was like, "Wow."

32:52.080 --> 32:54.970
No one's ever done that for me before.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.407
Then you kept going and going...

32:57.600 --> 33:00.490
...and I realized whatever
is going on with you...

33:00.680 --> 33:03.650
...has nothing to do with my honor, at all.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.526
Hm.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.520
You got all that from a bar fight? Wow.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.881
You're good.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.128
I wait tables at a roadhouse.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.891
I meet the bad guys.
I meet the good guys.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.687
And maybe for a second there I thought
you were a good guy playing bad.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.082
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.965
Maybe you're just...

33:26.160 --> 33:30.290
The kind of guy who sleeps with every skank
in every small town dive he passes through.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.570
Well, you really do know
how to read people.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.161
Because that sure as hell sounds like me.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.369
Now, see...

33:45.480 --> 33:47.608
...I'm so screwed up myself...

33:47.800 --> 33:50.610
...I'm gonna walk out of here
thinking I actually deserved that.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.081
What I'll never understand is...

34:07.280 --> 34:11.967
...why angels won't acknowledge
the wisdom to be found down here?

34:12.159 --> 34:14.367
What wisdom is to be gained
from humans?

34:15.480 --> 34:17.322
I'm not speaking to you.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.322
Do you understand what he's...?

34:22.600 --> 34:23.965
Fine.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.569
But if you were to be free,
that is to be decided by all angels.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.650
There's that angelic irony.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.002
We're not going back there.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.123
Not ever.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.606
Adina.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.684
This is Hannah and Castiel.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.011
Stow the blade, please.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.170
When she stows hers.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.650
Hannah, what are you doing?

34:50.840 --> 34:53.525
We'll never get a chance to argue
our freedom from prison.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.849
You should have thought of that
before slaughtering one of your own.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.646
We were talking.
We were getting somewhere.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.491
- Everybody just...
- You want to be free? Go ahead.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.727
Be free.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.967
Hannah.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.204
Stop this.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.682
No. Daniel!

35:23.520 --> 35:24.931
No.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.730
We have to get her.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.130
- She's gone.
- We have to.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.891
Hannah, it's over.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.005
Let's go.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.884
Let's go.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.765
Okay, home sweet home.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.326
Breathe.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.603
There you go.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.249
You good, partner?

36:29.440 --> 36:31.363
How's that chicken wing?

36:32.640 --> 36:34.369
Who are you?

36:37.280 --> 36:38.611
First time I broke my arm...

36:39.240 --> 36:42.801
...my older brother, Davey, had me riding
on the handles of his three-speed.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.285
Decided to pop us a wheelie.

36:45.480 --> 36:49.326
Look real fancy
for all the little pretties outside the DQ.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.643
Well, we were looking mighty good
for a little bit.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.448
And then whoop...

36:57.280 --> 36:58.805
...ass end over teakettle, boy.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.961
Hurt like a son of a bitch.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.688
You're Sam Winchester.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.530
I think we both can agree on that.

37:13.320 --> 37:15.561
Your older brother Dean, well...

37:17.320 --> 37:20.210
...he and I, we go way back.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.689
You a hunter?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.365
Sure.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.210
Yeah, we can go with that.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.330
Hunting your brother counts, right?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.281
Heh.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.488
I wouldn't do that.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.967
- Yeah.
- Trust me.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.640
Look, buddy,
I don't know who you are, all right?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.171
I don't know what you want...

37:41.400 --> 37:43.129
...or what my brother did.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.805
But if you got any sense...

37:45.000 --> 37:48.004
...I suggest you turn tail
and run back to that...

37:48.240 --> 37:51.210
...Army recruiting ad
that spit you out in the first place.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.443
- He's a monster.
- Well, he was.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.089
Yeah, he was.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.405
Many, many moons ago.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.328
But now he's prey.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.089
And I'm the monster now.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.846
We have to report this.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.850
And say what?

38:34.080 --> 38:35.650
Things got out of control?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.128
Another angel has died.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.205
He was going to kill me, Castiel.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.244
They just wanted to be left alone.

38:46.680 --> 38:50.241
Without rules, there's chaos.

38:51.120 --> 38:55.250
Out of chaos rise angels
like Naomi, Bartholomew...

38:56.880 --> 38:58.848
...Metatron.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.686
Well, perhaps I've been down here
with them for too long.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.206
There's seemingly...

39:10.400 --> 39:12.607
...nothing but chaos.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.928
But not all bad comes from it.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.250
Art.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.726
Hope.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.326
Love. Dreams.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.925
But those are human things.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.690
Yes.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.765
I left you an open tab at the bar.
Knock yourself out.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.928
Hell, I just may take you up on that.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.924
- And who is this?
- Me?

40:00.840 --> 40:02.001
I'm karma, brother.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.521
- On my brother's phone?
- On your brother's phone.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.366
- Is he dead?
- No, not yet.

40:10.560 --> 40:14.246
As long as you show up where I tell you,
your brother will be just fine.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.125
And how do I know he's still alive?

40:21.680 --> 40:23.125
Speak.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.486
- Proof of life.
- Dean!

40:36.680 --> 40:39.126
- Got a pen?
- No, you listen to me.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.484
There's no trade. There's no meetup.
There's no nothing...

40:43.680 --> 40:48.129
...except the 100 percent guarantee
that somewhere down the road...

40:48.320 --> 40:51.164
...I will find you, and I will kill you.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.481
That'll be a cold comfort
to your dead brother.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.361
I told him to let me go,
so whatever jam he's in now...

40:58.600 --> 41:00.170
...that is his problem.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.648
Yeah, I'll be sure to pass that on to him
as I'm slitting his throat.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.525
Yeah, you do that, because he knows me.

41:06.720 --> 41:10.327
And he knows damn sure
that if I am one thing...

41:10.520 --> 41:12.921
...I am a man of my word.
