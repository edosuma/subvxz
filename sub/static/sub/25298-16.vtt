Aah! No!
My body's betrayin' me!

09:59.719 --> 10:03.773
No! Listen up! I'm here
on a selfless mission!

10:03.773 --> 10:05.645
I'm such
a dang charismatic fool,

10:05.645 --> 10:07.107
I had to go and steal
the spotlight

10:07.107 --> 10:09.819
when it should
have been on my dad,
Bill Green,

10:09.819 --> 10:11.941
<i> and his amazing watermelon!</i>

10:11.941 --> 10:13.193
Son.

10:13.193 --> 10:15.785
He worked so hard
and asked for no kudos.

10:15.785 --> 10:17.617
<i> But the man deserves
his kudos.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:19.289

Oh!

10:44.354 --> 10:45.395
Aah!

10:54.534 --> 10:56.826

11:53.333 --> 11:55.385
They're comin'
from behind you!

11:57.887 --> 11:59.549
Greetings, idiots!

11:59.549 --> 12:01.551
Ha ha! They got li'l hats
on their ships!

12:01.551 --> 12:02.892
Oh, no... it's them!

12:02.892 --> 12:05.475
The meanest online bullies
that ever lived!

12:05.475 --> 12:08.308
That's right!
We are the Cyber Knights!

12:08.308 --> 12:10.400
-The cyber-what-now?
-Just do what they say!

12:10.400 --> 12:12.692
We don't stand a chance
against these guys!

12:12.692 --> 12:16.236
All right, hand over
your space coins
or get wasted!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.527
No one do anything stupid.

12:17.527 --> 12:19.028
Remy, just give them
the money.

12:19.028 --> 12:21.661
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

12:21.661 --> 12:24.994
<i> I said hand over
the space coins!</i>

12:24.994 --> 12:26.626
These guys are
all whack-a-do.

12:26.626 --> 12:27.997
What are you
gonna do, Remy?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.869
Oh, I don't know!
I should just do it, right?

12:29.869 --> 12:30.920
They're being
so confrontational!

12:30.920 --> 12:32.252
Should I call
my parents?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.963
Remy, get a hold
of yourself!

12:33.963 --> 12:35.875
You've got to stand
your ground!

12:35.875 --> 12:37.677
I'm sorry, Cricket.
I can't.

12:37.677 --> 12:38.798
Remy, no, stop!
Don't do it!

12:38.798 --> 12:40.510

12:44.724 --> 12:47.477
<i> Now beat it!
This is our astro-turf!</i>

12:47.477 --> 12:50.480
<i>Yeah, and try not to cry
too much on your way out!</i>

12:50.480 --> 12:51.941

No pwomises.

12:55.945 --> 12:58.067
Hmm! Know what I think?

12:58.067 --> 12:59.949
Y'all are
a bunch of bullies!

12:59.949 --> 13:01.861
[gasps] Cricket,
what are you doing?!

13:01.861 --> 13:03.032
You can't talk
to them like that!

13:03.032 --> 13:04.994
Aah! Beanbag betrayal!

13:04.994 --> 13:07.036
-What was that?!
-How dare you defy us?!

13:07.036 --> 13:08.828
We are the Cyber Knights,

13:08.828 --> 13:11.541
and we demand that you
bow down to us!

13:11.541 --> 13:12.962
I ain't bowin' down
to nobody,

13:12.962 --> 13:15.915
and I never will.
[raspberry]

13:15.915 --> 13:18.508
And that is how you deal
with punks like them.

13:18.508 --> 13:21.090
Aah! Aah!
Beanbag betrayal!

13:21.090 --> 13:23.593
Yeah, you gotta stand
up for yourself

13:23.593 --> 13:24.924
or people will walk
all over ya.

13:24.924 --> 13:26.346
That's a Cricket life tip.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.888
Also, a block of cheese
is a sometimes snack.

13:28.888 --> 13:30.810
That's
a Tilly life tip.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.733
I had no idea you could just
stand up to bullies like that.

13:33.733 --> 13:35.234

See, Remy, this is
exactly what I'm
talkin' about.

13:51.751 --> 13:53.793
I've said it once,
and I'll say it again!

13:53.793 --> 13:55.665
I'll never bow down to you!

<i> Ha ha ha! We have ways
of making you comply.</i>

13:58.958 --> 14:02.592
<i> For starters,
we'll hack your email!</i>

14:02.592 --> 14:04.013
I don't have an email.

14:04.013 --> 14:07.467

Not my handheld tablet!

14:15.775 --> 14:17.106
Don't got one of those,

Oh, no!
There's been a mistake.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.053
I have
to cancel the ride.

14:44.053 --> 14:45.555
Well, if you cancel,

14:45.555 --> 14:46.636
I'll have
to demote you a star.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.468
Not my perfect
five-star rating!

14:48.468 --> 14:50.179

just do what they ask

14:50.179 --> 14:51.471
before this gets
out of hand!

14:51.471 --> 14:53.142
Okay,
off to the airport!

Hurry, Cricket!

What have they done?!

15:03.783 --> 15:07.116
Kiki! Did those jerks
throw you in the trash?

15:07.116 --> 15:08.528
No, I put myself
in the trash.

15:08.528 --> 15:09.989
What-- What are you
talkin' about?

15:09.989 --> 15:12.662
I was just playing
my Bintendo Twist,

15:12.662 --> 15:14.744
when that drone came and--

15:14.744 --> 15:17.837
deleted all my saved data!

That's horrible!

I have nothing now,

15:21.461 --> 15:23.633
and it's all
your fault, Cricket.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.044
Why did you have
to upset them?

15:25.044 --> 15:27.096
Why, Cricket?!

from the airport,

16:00.880 --> 16:03.292
and then I found Kiki
laying in the middle
of the road!

16:03.292 --> 16:06.135
No games,
no will to live.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.872
Well, here we are Cricket.
Do your worst.

16:32.872 --> 16:34.373
I speak for all of us
when I say

16:34.373 --> 16:37.116
that we aren't afraid
to stand up to you!

16:37.116 --> 16:39.248
But, uh--
Where'd everyone go?!

16:39.248 --> 16:41.581
Oh. Well, everyone is hiding

16:41.581 --> 16:44.383
and being too afraid
to stand up to the bullies.

16:44.383 --> 16:45.384
[cowering]

16:45.384 --> 16:46.385
Aah! [grunts]

16:46.385 --> 16:47.927
I'm okay!

16:47.927 --> 16:49.889
C'mon, guys! What's
the matter with you?

16:49.889 --> 16:51.180
We need
to stick together

16:51.180 --> 16:52.892
and stand up to
these bullies as a team!

16:52.892 --> 16:55.014
No way! You might not
have anything to lose,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.767
but they'll keep torturing us
for the rest of our lives.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.019
We are slaves
to the cycle.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.771
It ain't easy
being Weezie.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.852
Oh, man,
that's rough.
I'm so sorry.

17:02.852 --> 17:04.443
It's okay, Weezie.

17:04.443 --> 17:06.235
Let's go home
and change all our passwords.

17:06.235 --> 17:08.277
Well, I'm gonna fight
for all of us,

17:08.277 --> 17:10.359
even if you guys don't
want to fight for yourselves!

17:14.153 --> 17:17.246
Remy! You've still
got my back, right, bud?

17:17.246 --> 17:19.038
I'm-- I'm sorry, Cricket.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.419
I don't want
any more trouble.

17:20.419 --> 17:21.751
If you just do
what they say,

17:21.751 --> 17:23.623
they won't bother us
anymore.

17:23.623 --> 17:25.464
But that's why we
have to stand up to them.

17:25.464 --> 17:27.256
They're bein' super mean
for no reason!

17:27.256 --> 17:29.468
I'm not gonna let them
walk all over us.

17:29.468 --> 17:31.050
I'm... I'm sorry.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.261
I don't know
what to do anymore!

17:32.261 --> 17:33.803
Remy!
Remy, wait!

17:33.803 --> 17:36.055
Wait, Remy, wait!

17:36.055 --> 17:37.136
Remy, don't go!

17:37.136 --> 17:39.478
Remy!
Aw, come on, Remy!

17:39.478 --> 17:41.060
Remyyyy!

17:42.521 --> 17:44.103
Yeah, c'mon back, Remy!
Come on!

17:45.394 --> 17:47.647
Remy, wait! Remyyyy!

17:49.108 --> 17:50.319
Remy!

17:50.319 --> 17:51.400
Oh, no, Remy, c'mon!

17:51.400 --> 17:54.283
Remy, wait! Remyyyy!

17:54.283 --> 17:56.495
Uhp, he's gone.

17:56.495 --> 18:00.539
Uh, hello! What happened
to standing up to us, huh?

18:00.539 --> 18:02.291
Or are you all talk?

18:02.291 --> 18:05.334
What do you say we finish
this with a duel?

18:05.334 --> 18:08.257
If I win, you leave me
and all my friends alone.

18:08.257 --> 18:10.840
If I lose,
I bow down to you.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.762
Deal.
But I choose the weapons.

18:12.762 --> 18:15.214
Squirt guns,
water balloons, snowballs?

18:15.214 --> 18:18.137
'Cause if its snowballs,
we're gonna have
to wait till winter.

18:18.137 --> 18:20.850
Uh, drones, obviously!

18:20.850 --> 18:22.351
Dang it. Probably
shoulda seen that comin'.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.933
Fine! Drones it is!

18:23.933 --> 18:25.605
So what're we waitin' for?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.897
Actually, my sunscreen's
wearing off.

18:27.897 --> 18:30.860
Uh, yeah,
my mega anime torrent just
finished downloading, so...

18:30.860 --> 18:32.401
Whatever!

18:32.401 --> 18:34.363
We'll finish this
tomorrow at dawn!

18:34.363 --> 18:36.405
See you then, loser!

18:36.405 --> 18:38.367
[all laughing]

18:38.367 --> 18:39.739
Cricket, what're you doin'?

18:39.739 --> 18:41.410
You don't have a drone!

18:41.410 --> 18:42.501
I'll think
of somethin', Tilly.

18:42.501 --> 18:43.833
I just don't get it.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.294
I know I'm doin'
the right thing,

18:45.294 --> 18:46.295
but since folks
are gettin' hurt,

18:46.295 --> 18:47.667
it feels
like the wrong thing!

18:47.667 --> 18:50.209
Oh, brother, I wish
I could lend a machete

18:50.209 --> 18:52.011
to your moral thicket.

18:52.011 --> 18:53.592
Thanks, Tilly.
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:53.592 --> 18:56.515
I have a lonely battle
to prepare for.

18:56.515 --> 18:59.348
[dramatic music playing]

19:00.720 --> 19:02.221
[wind whistling]

19:06.726 --> 19:09.028
This is gonna be
a walk in the park.

19:09.028 --> 19:10.029
[all laughing]

19:10.029 --> 19:11.400
I get it.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.441
You brought your drone,

19:12.441 --> 19:14.273
and I brought mine!

19:14.273 --> 19:15.655
What the heck is that?

19:15.655 --> 19:18.447
Ha! You think you can
beat us with a kite?

19:18.447 --> 19:19.578
Let's duel!

19:19.578 --> 19:20.660
Yah!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.491
[all laughing]

19:22.491 --> 19:23.833
[Cricket, battle cry]
Aaaah!

19:23.833 --> 19:25.745
[Cyber Knights laughing]

19:25.745 --> 19:27.667
Isn't that nice, sweetie?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.419
Kids just playin' around.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.922
[Cyber Knights]
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!

19:32.922 --> 19:34.674
[grunting] Hyah!

19:34.674 --> 19:35.925
[Cyber Knight #2]
Can't dodge our attacks forever!

19:35.925 --> 19:36.966
Oh!

19:39.178 --> 19:40.349
[both] Oh, no!

19:40.349 --> 19:42.141
Our beautiful drones!

19:42.141 --> 19:45.014
Respawn, you fool!
Respawn!

19:45.014 --> 19:46.435
Ha ha! Gotcha!

19:46.435 --> 19:48.808
Oh, you don't got nothin'!

19:48.808 --> 19:50.229
Oh, cranberries!

19:50.229 --> 19:53.272
Aah! Yaah! Oh, no!
My kite!

19:53.272 --> 19:55.314
[leader]
Face it! You lost!

19:55.314 --> 19:57.116
Now bow down
to the Cyber Knights!

19:57.116 --> 19:58.778
Never!

19:58.778 --> 20:01.620
Then you leave me
with no choice
but to destr--

20:01.620 --> 20:03.322
Huh? What the?!

20:04.623 --> 20:05.955
What is this?

20:05.955 --> 20:07.206
Huh?!

20:07.206 --> 20:09.378
[gasps]
Guys! You're here!

20:09.378 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, Tilly told us
what you were planning.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.752
You were right, Cricket.

20:12.752 --> 20:14.383
We don't want to run away
for the rest of our lives.

20:14.383 --> 20:15.594
It is what it is.

20:15.594 --> 20:17.676
Yeah. What Weezie said.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.508
Let's end this, brother.

20:19.508 --> 20:21.390
Yeah! Together!

20:21.390 --> 20:23.682
Grrr! I don't care
how many of you there are!

20:23.682 --> 20:25.805
You'll never
take down my drone!

20:25.805 --> 20:27.516
Never! Never! Neverrrr!

20:27.516 --> 20:28.898
Huh?

20:28.898 --> 20:30.850
You're taking
down my drone!

20:30.850 --> 20:33.402
[kids cheering]

20:34.483 --> 20:36.355
Cricket,
deal the final blow!

20:36.355 --> 20:38.027
With pleasure!

20:39.198 --> 20:40.409
Oh, no.

20:40.409 --> 20:41.490
Yaah!

20:41.490 --> 20:44.033
Yaaah-gahh!

20:48.327 --> 20:50.709
Kids just bein' kids.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.710
Noooo!

20:51.710 --> 20:53.923
Hey! Good game,
but you lost.

20:53.923 --> 20:57.296
So take your drones
and leave us alones!

20:57.296 --> 20:58.377
[growls]

20:58.377 --> 20:59.718
Okay, whatever!

20:59.718 --> 21:00.800
[all] Huh?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.181
What is happening?!

21:02.181 --> 21:03.682
Man, I think
the batteries died.

21:03.682 --> 21:05.434
You mean we gotta walk?

21:05.434 --> 21:08.347
[all groaning]

21:08.347 --> 21:10.019
Well, that's just sad.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.561
Hey, thanks for encouraging us
to stand up for ourselves.

21:12.561 --> 21:14.483
Sorry we
almost bailed on you.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.235
Well, I'm sorry things
got so out of hand

21:16.235 --> 21:17.987
and all y'all's
Internets almost died.

21:17.987 --> 21:20.069
Also, thanks for comin'
to save me.

21:20.069 --> 21:21.070
Hey, where'd Benny go?

21:21.070 --> 21:22.401
[Benny laughing]

21:22.401 --> 21:24.663
I've taken out
one bully,

21:24.663 --> 21:26.826
time to take down
the rest!

21:26.826 --> 21:29.038
