WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:05.713
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

00:05.880 --> 00:08.924
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

00:09.217 --> 00:11.301
- Oh, my God. They took my idea.
- That was you?

00:11.469 --> 00:12.678
Yeah.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.680
Okay, there you go.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.057
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.809
Oh, that's so... Aah!

00:19.227 --> 00:20.936
Ow!

00:21.104 --> 00:23.647
- Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?
- You all right?

00:26.484 --> 00:27.818
Oh, my.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.748
Hey.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.292
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

01:27.962 --> 01:31.090
Oh, so that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.344
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.805
Okay? You should come out
with Ross and me.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.475
I mean, anything is better than sitting
around here crying all day about Kate.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.811
Hey, I was crying because...

01:43.978 --> 01:47.397
Because nobody believed Quincy's theory,
okay?

01:47.816 --> 01:50.067
- Hey. I'm gonna be on TV.
- Hey.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.610
- No way.
- Yeah.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.447
They're putting together this panel to talk
about these fossils they found in Peru.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.199
The Discovery Channel's gonna film it.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.161
Oh, my God. Heh.
Who's gonna watch that?

02:02.705 --> 02:04.289
- Thanks. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.667
Ahem, I saw a girl with that vest.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.210
Thanks.

02:10.505 --> 02:14.758
- Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.845
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.140
Unfortunately, the sad fact remains...

02:21.307 --> 02:24.226
...that most of these little guys
won't live to see the Fourth of July.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.646
Because as a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.065
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.609
Because I was watching this,
uh, commercial on TV...

02:32.777 --> 02:35.404
...and, man, those things are cute.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.241
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.661
Oh, Pete, you're back.
Hey, check this out.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.621
Wow. Skates. Ha, ha.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.206
Whoa.

02:47.667 --> 02:52.462
Wow. You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.630
So how was your trip?

02:53.798 --> 02:56.633
- Well...
- Oh, what did you bring me?

02:57.886 --> 03:01.305
Aw, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.515
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.143
- You want some coffee?
- Sure, that'd be great.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.311
Okay.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.274
- Regular or decaf?
- Ha, ha.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.194
- Uh, whichever's closest.
- All right.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.029
- Okay.
- So ask me what I did today.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.488
So, what did you do today, Pete?

03:18.656 --> 03:21.158
I bought a restaurant,
and I would like you to be the chef.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.993
What? Oh.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.334
Can you believe
he just offered me a restaurant?

03:30.501 --> 03:33.545
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

03:33.963 --> 03:37.341
I mean, this has been my dream
since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

03:37.508 --> 03:40.135
...and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

03:47.101 --> 03:50.520
I mean, I would kill for this job.
I mean, I can totally do this job...

03:50.688 --> 03:54.983
...and God knows I've paid my dues. Ugh.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.570
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

03:58.738 --> 04:02.574
- And you're still not attracted to him at all?
- Mm. No.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.494
I mean, how could I accept a restaurant
from him? I can't.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.872
I couldn't even accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.043
Yeah, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.170
- Ow.
- What, honey?

04:15.338 --> 04:18.798
Ow, my side still hurts
from when you crashed into me yesterday.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.716
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- I know. Ow.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.511
Oh, God.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.722
- Hey, you guys. Guess what.
- Hey.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.270
Got a job on a riverboat?

04:33.564 --> 04:36.525
You know what? I didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.902
Guess what. You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

04:39.070 --> 04:41.571
- Oh, I see. So this suit is making a point.
- Mm.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.908
Now that you're on your own,
you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.703
You like it, right?

04:47.870 --> 04:51.248
Absolutely. I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.376
Huh. Ross, Ross, I'm kidding.
Come here.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.546
- What were you gonna tell us?
- Was it how you invented the cotton gin?

04:57.714 --> 04:58.797
Okay, goodbye.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.926
So, um, after you put the suggestion
in the box...

05:03.094 --> 05:05.595
...how long did it take
for the roller-skating thing to happen?

05:05.763 --> 05:07.472
Um, about three months.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.392
Okay, so I guess that's about,
uh, two weeks...

05:10.560 --> 05:12.185
...before the topless thing kicks in.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.773
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.486
I got you something. Open it. Open it.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.031
Okay.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.078
It's a chicken.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.664
It's cute, huh?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys,
do you know anything about chicks?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.836
Fowl? No.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.839
Women? No.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.800
Okay, well,
they are a huge responsibility.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.970
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.057
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

05:50.224 --> 05:53.518
Oh, well, no problem there.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.566
Easy, Lenny.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.407
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.950
Okay, here's the thing.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.995
Oh, no. Not "the thing."
I hate "the thing."

06:12.163 --> 06:13.455
What's "the thing"?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.458
I can't do it.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.460
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

06:18.628 --> 06:21.463
...but, um, see,
you have these feelings for me.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.007
Wait, wait, wait.
That's what you're worried about?

06:24.175 --> 06:25.926
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.677
- Huh?
- No.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.681
I was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but I met somebody else, on my trip.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.058
Oh?

06:33.267 --> 06:36.144
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
Uh, we met on the plane.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.146
She asked me if she could
finish off my peanuts.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.024
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.113
Yeah, I just...
I mean, I got tired of waiting.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.827
Oh, that's great. I mean,
I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.037
- And now I can work for you.
- I guess you can.

06:54.205 --> 06:58.625
Oh, my God. Oh, this is incredible. Oh.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.921
All right. You know what? I'm just gonna
roll right into that office and quit.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.714
- All right.
- Okay.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.300
- Could you give me a little push?
- Yeah, sure.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.637
- Good luck.
- I'm quitting. Woo-hoo!

07:14.142 --> 07:16.476
I'm okay. I'm all right.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.567
Wow. That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.527
What?

07:25.736 --> 07:29.531
I'm just saying, this woman,
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

07:30.491 --> 07:32.701
- Why would you say that?
- You're still into Monica.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.954
So you told her there's somebody else
so she'd agree to work with you.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.374
Because you figure, if you spend time
together, maybe something might happen.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.878
You're good. You're good.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.673
Yeah. No, I'm fairly intuitive.
And psychic.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.134
It's a substantial gift.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.054
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her, though?

07:53.222 --> 07:56.975
Absolutely. Oh, I promise. Tell her what?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.269
Thanks a lot.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.230
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive,
but my memory sucks.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.568
Okay, but this is the last time.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.155
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

08:10.323 --> 08:13.074
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

08:13.242 --> 08:14.701
Chicken

08:16.871 --> 08:18.246
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.290
How's she doing?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.875
She?

08:22.043 --> 08:23.919
Well, yeah. Don't you think it's a she?

08:24.795 --> 08:26.254
I don't know.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.892
I can't tell. Whatever it was,
went back in too quickly.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.438
Anyway, I gotta change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.898
Excuse me?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.566
What?

08:46.734 --> 08:48.860
I stayed home from work
while you were at rehearsal...

08:49.028 --> 08:51.571
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

08:51.739 --> 08:56.034
Hey. Who was up from 2:00 this morning
until 5:00 this morning...

08:56.202 --> 08:58.161
...trying to get her back to sleep?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.664
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.083
Oh, here it comes.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.795
Yes. Here it comes.
I'm stuck here all day.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.131
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us...

09:11.968 --> 09:15.387
...and then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

09:15.638 --> 09:17.514
Well, I don't think so, mister.

09:17.682 --> 09:22.310
Hey. I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.647
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.944
That's not what I said.
Okay, I just meant...

09:31.112 --> 09:33.613
I know what you meant.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.622
Did you notice that ever since
we got this chick...

09:43.291 --> 09:46.126
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

09:48.212 --> 09:51.047
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready
to have a chick.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.302
I'll take her back tomorrow.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.012
You think we'll get our 3 bucks back?

09:59.390 --> 10:00.682
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.975
Oh. Hey.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.937
Listen, I have that TV thing in,
like, two hours, and I need your help.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.691
Okay, what do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

10:09.859 --> 10:12.736
Well, the brown one
brings out your eyes.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.988
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.658
Really?

10:21.954 --> 10:23.163
Ow.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.467
Wow. That aspirin dance really works.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.429
- Ow.
- Oh, my God. Is that still?

10:39.597 --> 10:40.889
I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.557
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.017
- Rach.
- Look, I'm fine.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.436
Watch. Look at that. Uh-oh.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.523
Okay, okay. Look, you've got
to go to a doctor, okay?

10:50.691 --> 10:53.818
No, I have to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.154
Very big deal. There's people there
that I have to meet.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.449
Yeah, and I'm sure you're gonna make
a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.493
It's nice to meet you."

11:02.870 --> 11:04.537
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

11:04.705 --> 11:08.166
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.543
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.796
- Rachel.
- Look, either help me or go.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.714
Fine. I'll go.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.468
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

11:22.473 --> 11:24.432
Sure. I'll help you.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.267
Oh, good. Good.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.770
Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

11:38.197 --> 11:42.617
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.328
Would you please help me
with this too?

11:52.211 --> 11:55.422
- Okay. Let's use this brush.
- Okay.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.632
- This stuff? All right.
- Yeah. Careful.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.219
Light. Okay, you know,
just sweep it across the lid.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.596
- Okay, just sweep it.
- Okey-dokey.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.348
- Oh. Hey.
- Sorry.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.308
- Ha, ha. That's poking me in the eye.
- Ha, ha.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.018
I'm sorry. Close, close, close.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.562
- Okay, just sweep it.
- I'm sweeping.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.440
- Right.
- Sweep, sweep...

12:13.774 --> 12:15.525
Okay, now make it even,
because we don't...

12:15.693 --> 12:17.444
- What?
- We don't want it...

12:17.611 --> 12:19.821
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.323
You know,
you don't wear enough of this.

12:26.662 --> 12:30.498
Since when...? Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

12:30.666 --> 12:34.919
Well, I... Close your eye. I just think
you're gonna like this better because...

12:35.129 --> 12:36.838
- Close, close.
- Blow it.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.256
Sorry.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.843
Because, um, I think this will make you
a little more sophisticated.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.720
Sophisticated like a hooker?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.558
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.393
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.562
I'm checking out the restaurant
with Pete.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.232
- Oh. Monica, I am so excited for you.
- I know.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.942
Ooh, I have to tell you something.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.820
- What?
- Well, I can't tell you.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.034
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier to tell
me something that you could tell me?

13:06.202 --> 13:08.328
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.917
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to, like, all my gods.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.920
Okay.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.922
Does it have to do
with Ross and Rachel?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.256
No.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.509
- Does it have to do with Joey?
- No.

13:22.676 --> 13:26.262
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock that he keeps by his bed?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.433
No, but let's come back to that later.

13:34.688 --> 13:38.191
There you go.
Good enough for your party? Huh?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.074
Sure.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.578
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from Purchasing.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.957
Come on.

13:54.124 --> 13:58.586
Okay, come on. All right, I gotta go.
So good luck at the party, okay?

13:58.754 --> 14:01.548
Oh, wait, Ross. Could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.468
Sure. Okay.

14:05.636 --> 14:09.764
Okay. Okay, great.
Um, okay, just turn around.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.767
- What?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

14:12.935 --> 14:17.438
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.817
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.946
Yeah, but that was different, you know?
We were going out then.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.739
Now it's weird.

14:26.907 --> 14:30.535
Rach, you know,
I can see you naked anytime I want.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.620
- What?
- Ha, ha.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.834
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See? Woo-hoo.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.548
- Ross, stop that.
- I'm sorry.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.634
Come on. I don't want you
thinking of me like that anymore.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.761
Uh, sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.472
It's one of my, uh, rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.892
Huh? Oh. Oh, yeah.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.979
- Stop it. Cut it out. Cut it out.
- Okay, okay.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.315
I'm sorry. It will never happen... Uh-oh.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.025
Wait a minute. Wait, wait...

15:02.192 --> 15:05.403
Now there are a hundred of you,
and I'm the king.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.448
- Ross...
- Oh, come on.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.992
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.996
All right. Fine.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.373
- Yowza.
- Okay.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.419
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.379
- Okay, that's it. Ow!
- Oh, come on.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.174
Oh, my God. All right, look, look, okay.

15:26.342 --> 15:30.345
Rach. Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

15:30.512 --> 15:32.472
- Okay, I do. I really do.
- Okay.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.141
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.185
Oh, wait, wait,
you're not gonna come with me?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.941
Of course I am.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.109
Uh, I just have to make a call.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.402
- Okay.
- Okay?

15:46.570 --> 15:48.446
Thank you.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.368
Ow!

15:53.535 --> 15:54.661
What's wrong?

15:54.828 --> 15:58.498
I'm sorry. I just can't go to the hospital
looking like this.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.876
- Does it involve travel?
- No.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.379
Does it involve clogs?

16:04.546 --> 16:07.090
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.050
- Clogs.
- No.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.718
- Claws?
- No.

16:13.347 --> 16:17.392
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel
or Chandler or Joey.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.936
- What about Pete?
- No.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.854
What is it?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.316
- What about Pete?
- I don't know.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.319
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.950
- Phoebe, would you just tell me?
- I can't.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.120
- Okay, you know, I gotta go.
- But you're so close. No.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.247
Something to do
with Pete's company?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.999
Ugh. Just go. You're never gonna get it.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.260
I know.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.847
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.850
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.814
I love you both.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.483
But in very different ways.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.194
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.406
Ooh. Ah.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.325
What are you doing?
I though you were gonna take her back.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.578
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.123
So then I took her to the shelter.
And you know what I found out?

17:28.130 --> 17:31.507
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.135
And I'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.805
Okay, good, good, good.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.391
Because I was kind of having
second thoughts too.

17:40.559 --> 17:44.479
Okay. And it's not just chicks, you know?
It's all kinds of other animals.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.315
That's horrible.
Well, you did the right thing, man.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.442
Thanks. I'm glad you see it that way.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.581
Oh, funny story.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.169
I don't believe this.

18:08.337 --> 18:11.923
Wow, look at this refrigerator.
It's gigantic.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.885
I mean, I could live in this thing.
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.099
Oh, my God. Look at these spider burners.
I love spider burners.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.517
So you like it?

18:22.684 --> 18:26.938
Oh, it is so perfect. Thank you so much.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.315
- You're welcome.
- Oh.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.572
Did you just smell my hair?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.201
No. No way. What? No.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.954
- Oh, God.
- What?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.249
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

18:46.583 --> 18:50.336
No. I'm just excited about the restaurant,
that's all.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.755
- Pete?
- Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

18:54.925 --> 18:57.969
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.220
It's really nice.

18:59.763 --> 19:03.516
Look, the only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.352
Yeah, you may be okay
with getting hurt...

19:06.520 --> 19:09.730
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.777
- That's why I can't take this job.
- What?

19:16.071 --> 19:18.698
Well, we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.075
I'm sorry.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.452
Okay. Yeah.

19:23.954 --> 19:27.790
I mean, if that's really what you want,
okay.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.587
Okay. Bye.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.468
I'm sorry things didn't work out...

19:39.636 --> 19:43.931
Shut up for a second
and let me just see something.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.938
Oh, wow.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.280
Okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?

19:59.448 --> 20:03.201
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

20:04.077 --> 20:09.248
Hey, now, you stay out here
and you think about what you did.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.628
- That's a duck.
- That's a bad duck.

20:16.548 --> 20:20.218
- How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
- Oh, it was... No, no.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.469
What thing? What thing?

20:21.637 --> 20:24.263
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.557
Easy.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.518
Okay, now, when you come back...

20:29.686 --> 20:32.480
...I hope you remember
that that chick is not a toy.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.277
What thing? What is this thing?

20:38.445 --> 20:43.157
Aw, I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.660
Oh, my God.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.578
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

20:47.746 --> 20:50.539
Ah, I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

20:50.707 --> 20:54.835
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.213
- Come on.
- I cannot believe you.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.967
- What?
- That is the sweetest thing.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.062
You should get some sleep.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.147
Okay.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.775
- So I'll, um...
- I'm sorry I spoiled your evening.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.361
No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.489
So I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.449
Mm-hm. Yeah.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.874
See you.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.930
What did you do?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.525
What you doing?

21:59.693 --> 22:01.736
Having a swim.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.904
What about the chick?

22:04.364 --> 22:05.906
Chicks don't swim.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.700
Are you sure?

22:09.453 --> 22:11.078
I don't know.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.915
- Should we try?
- Sure.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.800
See, I told you. They don't swim.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.304
- Well, give him a minute.
- No.

22:29.306 --> 22:33.059
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
