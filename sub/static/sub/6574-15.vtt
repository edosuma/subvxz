00:13.873 --> 00:16.608
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

00:16.629 --> 00:18.070
[speaking alien language]

00:18.071 --> 00:19.272
Earthling...

00:20.606 --> 00:22.974
<i>Translating Interlac.</i>

00:22.975 --> 00:25.251
Now does the witness
understand?

00:25.331 --> 00:30.535
Yes, Tribune. But I can only repeat
again what we have said all along.

00:30.602 --> 00:33.958
<i>The Justice League, that is,
my fellow defendants and myself,</i>

00:33.970 --> 00:37.706
<i>never meant to attack Rimbor
or its inhabitants.</i>

00:37.743 --> 00:42.330
We are not conquerors, not criminals.
Our only interest is in peace.

00:42.362 --> 00:49.272
Forgive us, Superman, if we,
who represent the Polygloture of Rimbor,

00:49.273 --> 00:51.908
<i>find that difficult
to swallow.</i>

00:51.924 --> 00:57.361
Nevertheless, it is the truth.
We had no control over our actions.

00:57.429 --> 01:01.451
So, no control over
the destruction you caused,

01:01.474 --> 01:04.918
the life forms you injured,
the terror you wrought,

01:04.968 --> 01:08.799
the children you scarred emotionally,
the little flowers you...

01:08.823 --> 01:13.407
Why does this trial continue? Surely
the bribes have changed hands by now.

01:13.444 --> 01:16.577
Inexplicably, the defendants
have refused to pay.

01:16.601 --> 01:18.592
These Earthlings
are savages.

01:18.623 --> 01:22.695
<i>...Levies and bribes due to this loss
of income which you brought about.</i>

01:22.726 --> 01:25.922
Exactly.
We were not in control.

01:25.990 --> 01:30.850
In fact, as stated previously, we were
under the complete mental domination

01:30.874 --> 01:33.739
of an Earth villain
named Vandal Savage.

01:33.772 --> 01:36.608
Why would one savage
do that to another?

01:36.682 --> 01:38.130
[sighs]

01:38.167 --> 01:40.869
That's still unclear.

01:40.998 --> 01:42.524
[all talking]

01:42.564 --> 01:45.141
- Did you see this?
- It's all of the poet-watcher.

01:45.209 --> 01:48.564
- It hardly proves that it's true.
- The Reach is on Earth.

01:48.583 --> 01:51.992
At least someone is taking
control of that rogue planet.

01:52.014 --> 01:55.717
But the Reach? Taking too much
influence throughout the galaxy.

01:55.784 --> 01:56.984
[all talking at once]

01:56.986 --> 01:59.287
Order! Order!

01:59.355 --> 02:03.191
<i>What does this mean?
What is the Reach?</i>

02:03.258 --> 02:05.794
<i>Millennia ago
they were conquerors,</i>

02:05.861 --> 02:09.298
<i>and it took the entire Green Lantern
Corps to check their advance.</i>

02:09.330 --> 02:12.535
<i>That led to a treaty signed
with the Guardians of the Universe.</i>

02:12.602 --> 02:16.502
<i>Now the Reach can only lay
claim to a world if invited.</i>

02:16.548 --> 02:18.740
<i>But Earth has invited them.</i>

02:18.795 --> 02:21.043
<i>No Lantern may go back there.</i>

02:21.111 --> 02:22.878
<i>Ever.</i>

02:22.946 --> 02:25.982
I said <i>order!</i>

02:26.050 --> 02:32.122
Hmm. If the Reach controls Earth and
exploits or expands its meta population,

02:32.190 --> 02:36.538
does that not have long-term
implications for who rules the Galaxy?

02:36.569 --> 02:38.882
[growls]

02:38.976 --> 02:40.905
[gasp]
The Reach!

02:41.133 --> 02:44.201
[all murmuring]

03:03.506 --> 03:07.121

03:10.326 --> 03:13.147
<i>We've been tracking something
on long-range scanners.</i>

03:13.178 --> 03:15.472
It's on a direct course
for Earth.

03:15.495 --> 03:19.067
It's about to pass in front of Rhea,
one of the moons of Saturn.

03:19.134 --> 03:22.637
Not <i>in front of Rhea</i>,
behind it.

03:22.688 --> 03:26.057
That thing, whatever
it is, is huge!

03:26.141 --> 03:30.511
[siren]

03:30.579 --> 03:32.868
Why would he come here,
and why now?

03:32.907 --> 03:34.881
Open a subspace channel.

03:34.925 --> 03:38.425
Attention. I am an ambassador
of the Reach

03:38.464 --> 03:42.555
and claim the Earth as property
of the Reach under Guardian Treaty.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.926
You are therefore breaching
Reach territory.

03:45.994 --> 03:49.501
- Reverse course.
<i>- Request denied.</i>

03:49.533 --> 03:53.050
<i>It is because the Reach
is on Earth that I am here.</i>

03:53.601 --> 03:55.569
Now what?

04:02.986 --> 04:04.879
Thank you for coming.

04:04.923 --> 04:07.259
My scarab has accessed
the Reach's database

04:07.290 --> 04:09.584
for intelligence
on the approaching threat.

04:09.651 --> 04:12.787
It is called the Warworld.

04:12.855 --> 04:17.692
<i>A massive artificial satellite,
slightly smaller than Earth's Moon.</i>

04:17.760 --> 04:20.428
<i>It is a mobile
doomsday weapon,</i>

04:20.495 --> 04:26.201
<i>created millennia ago by an now
understandably extinct alien race.</i>

04:26.269 --> 04:30.439
<i>It is self-powering
and self-sustaining,</i>

04:30.507 --> 04:35.411
<i>thanks to an endless supply
of worker drones providing repair</i>

04:35.479 --> 04:38.814
<i>and battle drones
providing security.</i>

04:38.882 --> 04:43.924
The Warworld was reactivated
by a crystal key, long thought lost,

04:44.010 --> 04:48.525
<i>yet somehow the
Warworld's current commander found it.</i>

04:48.913 --> 04:53.963
<i>That commander, Mongul,
now sits at the Warworld's helm,</i>

04:54.031 --> 04:56.894
<i>which receives and transmits
his every thought,</i>

04:56.925 --> 05:00.337
<i>allowing him to control all
of the Warworld's functions...</i>

05:00.404 --> 05:05.308
<i>Trajectory, weapons, and drones,
without moving a muscle.</i>

05:13.685 --> 05:15.603
Who is this Mongul?

05:15.650 --> 05:19.355
Long ago, he was the sole
dictator of his home planet.

05:19.423 --> 05:24.193
But he was ousted by another tyrant
and is determined to reclaim his throne.

05:24.261 --> 05:26.462
So what does that
have to do with us?

05:26.530 --> 05:30.099
Mongul has determined that
the surest way to take back his world

05:30.167 --> 05:33.702
is to first conquer
the entire Galaxy.

05:33.770 --> 05:38.474
One can only assume he now views Earth
as a threat to that plan,

05:38.542 --> 05:45.582
<i>And so he comes, with literally enough
firepower to destroy your world.</i>

05:46.979 --> 05:51.336
Ah, it's great. We're finally spending
a little quality time together.

05:52.262 --> 05:53.462
Karen!

05:53.489 --> 05:56.925
Sorry, I'm a little
preoccupied...

05:56.993 --> 06:00.017
With the second moon
in the sky!

06:01.115 --> 06:04.707
<i>There's panic across the
country and around the world.</i>

06:04.746 --> 06:08.236
<i>What NASA calls
"an encroaching planetary body"</i>

06:08.249 --> 06:11.418
<i>is already having a gravitational
impact on the Earth.</i>

06:11.540 --> 06:14.724
<i>Tides have altered,
and so-called mini tidal waves</i>

06:14.741 --> 06:16.442
<i>have become commonplace.</i>

06:16.478 --> 06:20.059
<i>The U.S. Weather Service is advising
the populace to stay off the water</i>

06:20.083 --> 06:21.996
<i>and move inland
from the coastlines.</i>

06:22.051 --> 06:26.199
<i>And it appears
this is only the beginning.</i>

06:29.325 --> 06:32.147
<i>The Reach
and the United Nations</i>

06:32.171 --> 06:36.224
<i>take this unprovoked and
aggressive threat very seriously.</i>

06:36.256 --> 06:40.064
Unfortunately, the Reach
only has this single ship,

06:40.103 --> 06:43.305
designed for peaceful
exploration and diplomacy

06:43.373 --> 06:46.042
and unequipped
with any weapons.

06:46.072 --> 06:50.146
Nevertheless, we pledge solidarity
with the people of Earth.

06:50.214 --> 06:54.722
The Reach will not
abandon you!

06:56.354 --> 07:01.225
Attention Warworld, this is
Captain Atom of the Justice League,

07:01.293 --> 07:03.327
representing
the planet Earth.

07:03.395 --> 07:08.433
- We wish to open negotiations.
<i>- But I am uninterested in negotiation.</i>

07:08.500 --> 07:13.245
<i>The Earth under the Reach's thumb
is too dangerous for my long-term plans.</i>

07:13.284 --> 07:14.893
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

07:14.940 --> 07:19.049
And frankly, if you understood
what you were in for with the Reach,

07:19.069 --> 07:24.584
you'd thank me for putting you out
of your collective misery, now.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.725
[growls]

08:27.974 --> 08:30.275
Not sure we're doing
much damage in the grand scheme.

08:30.631 --> 08:35.335
But Rocket's protecting dr. Fate allow him
to maintain focus on safeguarding Earth.

08:35.364 --> 08:39.299
And Captain Marvel, Green Beetle,
and I seem to have Mongul's attention.

08:39.399 --> 08:40.870
Good.

08:44.723 --> 08:48.011
Because the Team's
already inside.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.565
Any sign of detection?

08:54.590 --> 08:58.539
No. Blue Beetle's scarab was able
to bypass the Warworld's security.

08:58.565 --> 09:01.140
Mongul doesn't know
they're inside... Yet.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.719
<i>Alpha Squad</i> to <i>Watchtower</i>.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.771
Green Beetle's schematics
are on the money, at least so far.

09:05.797 --> 09:09.369
- We're en route to take down Mongul.
- No, commander, the threat ends.

09:09.437 --> 09:11.583
Beta Squad is en route
to the key chamber.

09:11.599 --> 09:13.874
We snag the crystal key
and the threat ends.

09:13.942 --> 09:16.910
<i>Gamma Squad</i> is en route
to disable the Warworld's power core.

09:16.962 --> 09:18.996
No power and the threat ends.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.215
<i>Delta Squad</i> moving into position. Laying
down cover fire for surface forces...

09:23.283 --> 09:24.933
<i>Now.</i>

09:30.356 --> 09:34.092
How odd to be rooting
for the champions of Earth.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.762
But everything depends
on their success.

09:44.732 --> 09:46.900
No way out.

09:56.549 --> 09:58.417
[screeching]

09:58.484 --> 09:59.985
Oh!

10:03.841 --> 10:06.041
Beetle to Watchtower.
We've been spotted!

10:06.091 --> 10:07.458
<i>The Warworld
knows we're here.</i>

10:07.526 --> 10:10.326
Fine with me.
I like the attention.

10:12.832 --> 10:16.929
At least a big alien <i>Death Moon</i>
notices when I'm around.

10:18.004 --> 10:21.407
Was that a slam on me,
in the middle of a mission?

10:21.434 --> 10:24.437
Woman, when are you not
in the middle of a mission?

10:28.582 --> 10:30.316
Raah!

10:37.375 --> 10:39.692
A little warning
might have been nice.

10:40.439 --> 10:44.497
- "Take cover."
- Nah. Come on, we're close.

10:54.942 --> 10:59.045
- He is a big one.
- This is your attack force?

10:59.113 --> 11:02.648
- I'm insulted.
- Learn to cope.

11:02.716 --> 11:04.383
Uhh!

11:04.451 --> 11:06.118
Unh!

11:06.186 --> 11:08.086
Rrr!

11:08.154 --> 11:09.554
Ooh!

11:09.622 --> 11:11.207
Uhh!

11:11.891 --> 11:16.894
Little Kryptonian.
So proud of your powers.

11:16.962 --> 11:24.669
Did you truly believe yours was the only
race to come from a world with a Red Sun?

11:24.737 --> 11:26.505
[grunts]

11:26.573 --> 11:29.341
Uhh! Uhh! Unh!

11:32.011 --> 11:33.211
Ahh.

11:33.212 --> 11:37.282
[grunting]

11:37.350 --> 11:39.451
Raah!

11:39.518 --> 11:41.186
Rrr!

11:41.253 --> 11:45.602
The novelty of this encounter
has officially worn off.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.898
[yelps]

11:48.403 --> 11:50.637
Naptop Ugly.

11:53.766 --> 11:56.167
[hissing]

11:56.235 --> 11:58.169
I like that.

11:58.237 --> 12:01.350
It smells like... Victory.

12:03.743 --> 12:05.044
Gaah!

12:05.111 --> 12:07.547
Uhh! No!

12:07.614 --> 12:09.605
Uhh!

12:12.021 --> 12:13.247
[grunts]

12:13.271 --> 12:15.721
Do you really not understand?

12:15.789 --> 12:17.643
Uhh... Ohh...

12:18.241 --> 12:21.938
Your deaths today in the
face of the Reach are a mercy.

12:22.631 --> 12:27.375
My grand laser remitter would have ended
your world in a matter of minutes.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.803
Another mercy.

12:28.871 --> 12:33.309
But it seems the mercies of Mongul
are not appreciated.

12:33.379 --> 12:35.862
So we will do this
the hard way,

12:35.893 --> 12:41.666
<i>and the Warworld will unleash
all its weapons upon the Earth.</i>

12:46.256 --> 12:48.380
You're welcome.

12:53.598 --> 12:57.097
<i>Earth's military leaders are mobilizing
all national air defense systems</i>

12:57.117 --> 12:59.809
<i>against the assault
from the rogue satellite.</i>

12:59.825 --> 13:02.546
<i>Here in the U.S., Homeland Security
is urging citizens</i>

13:02.572 --> 13:07.293
<i>to remain calm and stay in your homes
rather than attempt evacuation.</i>

13:07.907 --> 13:10.590
There's nowhere for us to go.

13:35.203 --> 13:36.637
<i>Delta to Watchtower.</i>

13:36.666 --> 13:39.137
Bioship estimates that Fate,
the League, and Delta

13:39.168 --> 13:43.241
are neutralizing 64% of the Warworld
saturation attack at the source.

13:43.296 --> 13:44.905
<i>But that's not
going to cut it.</i>

13:44.944 --> 13:50.169
Watchtower estimates that Earth's military
forces will neutralize a further 13%.

13:52.880 --> 14:00.458
But a 23% saturation is enough to decimate
a hemisphere and spoil all Earth's meat.

14:02.518 --> 14:05.086
Then, to protect
the Reach's investment,

14:05.154 --> 14:07.517
mobilize the fleet.

14:27.578 --> 14:30.730
We have sacrificed
two-thirds of our fleet

14:30.742 --> 14:33.344
to successfully
safeguard the Earth,

14:33.404 --> 14:35.695
<i>for the time being...</i>

14:44.729 --> 14:47.198
Super-cycle's got our backs!

14:47.265 --> 14:51.135
- Another lady I can count on.
- All right, I get it.

14:51.163 --> 14:53.528
I'm a bad girlfriend.
Now quit pouting.

14:53.575 --> 14:55.597
Who's poutin'?
I'm not poutin'!

14:55.674 --> 14:59.963
- Let's just blow this place and go.
- Uh, we can't just "blow this place."

15:00.012 --> 15:02.936
It would destroy all of Warworld
and take half of Earth with it.

15:02.979 --> 15:05.857
We need to follow the plan
and shut the core down.

15:05.886 --> 15:09.847
Well, thank you for explaining
the obvious to your idiot boyfriend.

15:09.886 --> 15:11.991
Just deal with the science
and get it done.

15:12.035 --> 15:14.003
What? I never said
you were...

15:14.094 --> 15:16.622
Ohh! Never mind.

15:17.321 --> 15:21.477
OK, here's hoping
Green Beetle knows his stuff.

15:22.602 --> 15:24.938
<i>Entering power core now.</i>

15:25.005 --> 15:26.950
Good luck, beautiful.

15:31.177 --> 15:33.981
Beta to Watchtower.
We're in!

15:34.049 --> 15:36.245
And there it is...

15:38.349 --> 15:40.161
The key...

15:45.059 --> 15:47.843
Uh, this could take a while.

15:48.494 --> 15:49.961
[growls]

16:04.609 --> 16:09.079
Uhh! There are too many failsafes built
into the core. The power keeps rerouting.

16:09.146 --> 16:12.143
Well, then reroute it
somewhere useful.

16:14.084 --> 16:17.745
Mal... I mean "Guardian."
You're a genius!

16:24.428 --> 16:27.022
Oh, pests.

16:36.635 --> 16:42.006
Aaahhh!

16:48.812 --> 16:50.934
He's rocked! Take him!

16:51.981 --> 16:54.382
Uhh!

16:54.450 --> 16:56.517
Uhh!

16:56.585 --> 16:57.519
Uhh!

16:57.586 --> 16:58.920
[grunting]

16:58.988 --> 17:01.022
Uhh-gaah!

17:01.089 --> 17:03.291
Uhh!

17:06.194 --> 17:08.194
Wondergirl, now!

17:09.092 --> 17:12.317
Awoo!

17:20.606 --> 17:23.875
All surface weapons have been silenced.
Is it over?

17:23.943 --> 17:26.355
<i>Mongul is down
and contained.</i>

17:26.381 --> 17:27.862
Nice work, Alpha!

17:27.901 --> 17:30.728
<i>I'd love to take credit,
but we didn't do it.</i>

17:30.736 --> 17:34.639
<i>His whole machine stumbled,
I'm guessing with a little help.</i>

17:38.156 --> 17:40.890
I'll just take this
for safekeeping.

17:54.635 --> 18:01.572
We have paid a price, but I believe
we've acquired value for the cost.

18:02.244 --> 18:04.241
Great job, everyone.

18:04.309 --> 18:07.763
Now rendezvous ASAP
so we can bring you home.

18:20.187 --> 18:23.985
- Oh, do we rock?
- Girl, we rock!

18:24.026 --> 18:27.228
- Was there ever any doubt?
- Not over here.

18:27.296 --> 18:28.730
Hey, where's Alpha?

18:28.759 --> 18:32.479
<i>Trudging along with the big bad,
who must weigh like a metric ton.</i>

18:32.518 --> 18:34.392
<i>We're just a couple minutes out.</i>

18:35.370 --> 18:40.641
I know we all did our part,
but, really, you saved the day.

18:40.709 --> 18:43.873
You and that big, beautiful
brain of yours.

18:44.397 --> 18:48.498
- Thanks. But it was your idea.
- I wouldn't call it an idea.

18:48.515 --> 18:50.434
More like a desperate
cry for help.

18:50.481 --> 18:54.221
Mal, you know I couldn't
have done it without you.

18:54.289 --> 18:57.925
No, that's not true.
You would have found a way.

18:57.993 --> 19:01.929
Karen, you are destined
for great things.

19:01.997 --> 19:07.902
And I haven't wanted to admit it,
to admit you've just outgrown me.

19:07.969 --> 19:11.338
But we can't hold on
to high school forever.

19:11.406 --> 19:16.254
And I really am
so proud of you.

19:16.293 --> 19:19.245
You know something?
You <i>are</i> an idiot.

19:19.313 --> 19:21.180
And I'm an idiot, too.

19:21.248 --> 19:23.321
I've been taking you
for granted,

19:23.384 --> 19:28.521
when the thing is, knowing you're there
for me makes all the difference.

19:29.259 --> 19:30.929
Mmm.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.394
<i>Wow.</i>

19:33.882 --> 19:35.390
How do I get that reward?

19:35.429 --> 19:36.696
Mwah!

19:36.764 --> 19:38.398
It's a start...

19:40.735 --> 19:42.703
Well, the gang's all here.

19:42.770 --> 19:44.604
Ohh!

19:45.840 --> 19:48.175
Look out!

19:48.243 --> 19:49.443
Ohh!

19:49.444 --> 19:51.111
Now!

19:51.179 --> 19:53.347
Blue, what are you doing?!

19:56.451 --> 19:58.686
Uhh! Uh!

19:58.754 --> 20:01.489
Uh... aah!

20:01.557 --> 20:05.860
[groaning]

20:10.378 --> 20:11.611
No...

20:11.766 --> 20:13.895
Not again.

20:14.068 --> 20:17.503
- Arsenal, no!
- I will not be taken again.

20:17.571 --> 20:18.771
[alarm sounds]

20:18.806 --> 20:23.876
[shouting]

20:25.913 --> 20:27.413
Aah!

20:27.481 --> 20:30.650
Aah! Aah!

20:33.120 --> 20:36.310
- Aah! - Uhh!
- Grrr!

20:36.333 --> 20:39.959
- Why..?
- Don't waste the oxygen, <i>hermano</i>.

20:40.026 --> 20:43.317
<i>There's very little
left in here.</i>

21:09.155 --> 21:13.947
Quite the value, indeed.
