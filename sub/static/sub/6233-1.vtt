Can you call someone about it?

-Yeah.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.833
Can somebody bring some
whole milk to, uh, register 9?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.872

I was just trying it on.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.745
I wanna look really hot
in my wedding dress.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.014
-I can't believe you have
to invite Jenny to the wedding.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.850
-Oh, I put her in the last
table with all the old people.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.486
-You know,
she actually made it seem like

05:18.519 --> 05:20.153
I was shoplifting at work.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.355
-What a bitch.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.190
She's literally
the spawn of Satan.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.726
You know what
you should tell her?
-What?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.396
-You should go up to her
and be like..

05:28.429 --> 05:30.263
...go fuck yourself.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.232

Let's look at her page.

Eww! Eww! Look at her page!

I'm telling you
somebody needs to loosen her up.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.751

when my fucking wedding is?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.569

that you're getting married.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.970

06:13.507 --> 06:17.878

ballet pink or snow bunny?

-God, all look the same.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.916
-No, they're slightly
different.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.285
- What is that smell?
-It's garbage night.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.488
They're burning garbage
over there.
-Oh, right.

06:27.521 --> 06:31.391
-It's the smell...
of hometown heroes.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.960

do you like the best?

What the fuck you think this is?
A car service?

model they got going.

You could move up.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.519
Is that my shirt?

but she's really fuckin' crazy.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.345
So crazy that I had to get
the fuck out of there.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.213
I tried sleepin' in my truck

14:40.247 --> 14:43.050
but then these cops
kept bothering me

14:43.083 --> 14:45.518
and -- and then I found this
place and it was really cute

14:45.552 --> 14:48.255
so I just came in.
It was open.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.257

That was me being --

15:11.011 --> 15:14.147
-No, but that's like a
paintin' and then you paint..

15:14.181 --> 15:16.649
You continued the paintin'

15:16.683 --> 15:20.320
and now it's a bigger paintin'.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.156
That's a Van Gogh shit.
That's really good.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.358

16:13.973 --> 16:15.875
You got one on sharks?

16:15.908 --> 16:17.344
-I watched those sometimes.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.180
-Animals' lives are so much
more interesting than humans.

thinking that maybe
I needed some alone time.

another night if you wanted to.

I wouldn't mind.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.750
I mean..

20:17.784 --> 20:20.420
I found a movie on Africa
we -- we could watch.

I think I have a couple

I was waiting for change *

this bar called Blue Room?

-You're a stripper?
- No. No, I'm not a stripper.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.638
I'm a bartender.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.276
It's not that bad.

-Where did your necklace
come from?

25:36.736 --> 25:39.572
-It's from Seattle.
I'm going to move there.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.141
-Why?

25:42.174 --> 25:45.377
-Because in Seattle
there is mountains.

25:45.411 --> 25:49.649
They have fish market,
and they have..

25:50.883 --> 25:52.551
...the ocean.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.823
-I've never been to the ocean.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.991
- You've never been
to the ocean?

[Sarah chuckles]

26:05.097 --> 26:09.235

I tried to run away once.

-You tried to run away?
-Yeah.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.372
-How feisty.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.708
-I walked to the end
of the town and this..

26:15.742 --> 26:18.611
...guy pulled over and asked me
if I needed a ride

26:18.645 --> 26:21.347
and I got scared
and I went home.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.016
-Maybe, maybe that was your

26:24.050 --> 26:25.652
Out of Jail Card?

26:25.685 --> 26:28.587
- Or maybe
it was my death trap.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.490
-I mean, yeah, he could have
slit your throat and..

26:31.523 --> 26:34.927
...and raped you, but so could
a man crossing the street.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.864
-Maybe some things
are supposed to happen.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.266
Like, maybe I'm supposed
to stay here forever.

26:41.533 --> 26:45.972
Let's face it,
10 years, I'm here..

26:46.005 --> 26:49.842
...I've 3 kids,
breast cancer..

26:49.876 --> 26:52.679
...and my husband will have,
like, a really big beer gut.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.682
- I'm sorry
if that's your fate.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.718
But maybe it's not, you know?

26:59.952 --> 27:04.123
I've done...a lot of things..

27:04.156 --> 27:07.159
...and I have,
I have a lot to learn.

27:07.193 --> 27:10.029
But...you know, I'd say..

27:11.530 --> 27:13.499
...one thing..

27:13.532 --> 27:17.203
...that I've learned
that's true..

27:17.236 --> 27:18.905
...is that..

27:18.938 --> 27:21.841
...if you don't make
your own choices in life..

27:24.243 --> 27:26.713
...the world will make them
for you.

Did you put money in the drawer?

28:47.994 --> 28:49.728
-Right.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.676
- So you said you've worked
as a cashier before.

Every couple of hours,
you'll do a walk around

29:07.013 --> 29:08.948
make sure
everything looks decent.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.917
Make sure that there's
condiments and napkins

29:10.950 --> 29:12.451
on every table.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.487
Make sure
that you watch out for spills.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.924
You know, if it gets sticky
there and somebody falls..

29:17.957 --> 29:20.526
Ugh, you know,
that could be a disaster.

After, like, those..
-One of them did.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.754
-...and Alison gave me two
black eyes.

-Oh, gosh!
-Two days before I..

30:25.591 --> 30:28.460
- Oh, man!
- It was awesome.
You know what?

30:28.494 --> 30:32.131
-What?
-Because I had already had a..

30:32.164 --> 30:35.701
-Uh-huh.
-And she said the first words,
"Stay away from John."

That's why they got
rid of her ass.

wasn't happy with boss man

about how much he had to pay
and she got caught

-I know the bartender.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.849
Pepper.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.320
-Pepper? Bartender?

32:03.889 --> 32:05.857
-Fresh meat.

32:13.966 --> 32:14.967
-What,
are you just gonna stare

32:15.001 --> 32:16.802
or you wanna buy it?

32:16.835 --> 32:18.470
-No, I'm okay.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.974
-Come here.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.877
Come here.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.884
First one is on me.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.122
-What is that?
-It's really chill.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.757
It's just prescription,
my grandma eats it
for breakfast.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.626
-I've never..
-It's okay.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.861
Just close one nostril.

32:42.894 --> 32:46.498
Like this.
Then take a deep breath.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.268
Yup. Good girl.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.240
-Ow.
-Alright, sit down.

-I'm Jaz.
-I'm Sarah.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.020
-Close.

33:08.054 --> 33:11.190
Sweetie, you don't wanna use
your real name here, okay?

33:11.223 --> 33:14.060
You don't want these customers
knowing anything about you.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.427
Close.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.830
Maybe something that
sounds like Sarah.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.669
Okay. Good luck.

I didn't really recognize you

-Just give me a second,
Jessie.

in here.

-Yeah, I -- I am,
I'm not supposed to be in here.

-Can't she just stay,
uh, for a second?

I can keep a secret.

What days are you working here?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.611
-Yeah, I'm fine, why?

39:39.645 --> 39:41.647
-It's 'cause you haven't
said anything all day.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.849
-No, I'm just tired.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.851
How was the honeymoon anyway?

39:45.884 --> 39:47.318
-It was fine. Whatever.

39:47.352 --> 39:50.021
-How's Dairy Dream?.

-Are you coming?
-Come on.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.601
-I'm not gonna come.
-Why not?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.369
-I just have a couple
of things I need to do.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.538
-Oh, come on, what do you
have to do on a Saturday?

40:06.572 --> 40:08.440
-Just a few things.

40:08.474 --> 40:09.975
I'll call you later.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.409
-Alright, see ya.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.616
Bye, Sarah.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.482
- So far, most of the work
on octopus intelligence

40:50.516 --> 40:52.784
has been carried out on..

40:52.818 --> 40:54.686
-I'll put these on you.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.822
- ...is trying a new approach
to further test

40:56.855 --> 40:58.924
this incredible animal's
thought process.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.127
Stromboli may offer
a natural habitat..

41:02.160 --> 41:04.329
-Here you go, madame.

41:04.362 --> 41:07.232
- ...because
this should be the perfect
location.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.536
- What is it about
the octopus' intelligence?

41:10.569 --> 41:12.904
-I wanna be an animal too.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.673
- ...to predict disaster.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.845
-I know what you'd be.
-What?

41:19.878 --> 41:22.814
-A meerkat.
-Why?

41:22.848 --> 41:24.716
- 'Cause, um..

41:24.750 --> 41:29.087
Well, I don't know you
that well, but...they're smart

41:29.120 --> 41:32.490
and they can eat scorpions.

41:32.524 --> 41:35.160
-I've never eaten
a scorpion before.

41:38.263 --> 41:42.167
-You've ever googled
abnormally large clitorises?

41:42.200 --> 41:44.670
-Boy, you're crazy.
- I'm not crazy.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.639
That's what they look like.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.443
-I'm pretty like this?
-Yeah.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.482
-I like you better
without the mask.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.317
-Me too.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.337
-You are new here, aren't you?
-Mm-hmm.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.640
-What's your name?
-Sahara.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.408
-Sahara.

42:25.577 --> 42:27.078
-Where's your accent from?

42:28.279 --> 42:30.849
-England.
-Oh, right.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.050
-Yeah.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.752
-Hi, daddy.
- Oh, my.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.221
My little angel.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.758

I got something special
for ya.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.059
- You do?
-Uh-huh.

42:41.092 --> 42:43.228
-Oh, alright.

42:47.265 --> 42:49.868
-I'm not ripping you off.
That's how it goes.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.269
-That's how it goes?
-Yeah.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.371
-But I wanna know why, uh

42:53.404 --> 42:56.174
I gotta be selling to you
when you've been beggin'.

42:56.207 --> 42:59.210
-These things don't even
go right. You know what
I'm saying?

-Yes.
-Yeah.

43:00.345 --> 43:02.047
- Go have fun.
- Always, baby.

You know it.
You have a good night.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.685
-Hey, so, uh

43:06.718 --> 43:09.520
the guy from Vegas came in
looking for you last night.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.323
-Yeah?

43:12.357 --> 43:14.125
What did you tell him?

43:14.159 --> 43:15.994
-I really didn't know
what to tell him

43:16.027 --> 43:18.196
other than, you weren't
staying with me anymore.

43:18.229 --> 43:21.399
-Well, if he comes in again,
just tell him I left.

43:21.432 --> 43:24.002
-Oh, he said you owe him
a lot of money.

43:24.035 --> 43:26.905
-Yeah, well,
that's what they all say.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.740
-You know and I gave you
a place to crash

43:28.774 --> 43:29.908
and hooked you up with the club

43:29.941 --> 43:32.944
so...just don't
get me in trouble, okay?

43:38.149 --> 43:40.451
[instrumental music]

43:42.988 --> 43:44.522
-Don't even bother
with that one.

43:44.555 --> 43:47.425
He'll just talk your ear off
and not even pay for your drink.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.461
-You know him?
-No, but I can just tell.

43:53.732 --> 43:54.900
[laughs]

43:54.933 --> 43:56.134
-See Ginger over there?

43:56.167 --> 43:58.336
[chuckles]

43:58.369 --> 44:01.973
She spends all night doing
laps around the room.

44:02.007 --> 44:03.608
Hustling all the customers.

44:04.943 --> 44:06.444
Not me.

44:06.477 --> 44:09.114
I will sit here
and enjoy my drink

44:09.147 --> 44:10.882
until I see the right guy.

44:10.916 --> 44:12.984
-And how do you know
he's the right one?

44:13.018 --> 44:15.086
-Just observe, honey.

44:16.187 --> 44:18.623
Okay.
You see that man over there?

44:19.891 --> 44:22.894
Just look at him,
he's scared of us.

44:22.928 --> 44:25.130
You're lucky if you get
one lap dance out of me.

44:26.631 --> 44:29.600
See that cocky bastard
over there?

44:29.634 --> 44:32.370
He'll wave you over, you know,
tip you a few dollars

44:32.403 --> 44:34.605
tell you there's more
where that came from.

44:34.639 --> 44:37.743
He doesn't even really have
any money to spend on you.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.511
This place is like
a little Petri dish.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.814
You know, there's some locals

44:42.848 --> 44:44.716
and they're good
for tips on stage.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.153
There's the freaks.

44:49.387 --> 44:52.924
There's pervs. Saviors.

44:52.958 --> 44:54.860
The one you really wanna be
looking for..

44:57.062 --> 44:59.330
...is totally confident,
you know.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.333
He doesn't have to prove it,
he just is.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.870
He may look like
he doesn't have money

45:04.903 --> 45:07.405
but there's something
special about him.

45:07.438 --> 45:10.909
He knows the difference
between what's real and what's
not

45:10.942 --> 45:12.443
and if you're real with him..

45:14.045 --> 45:16.447
...you walk away
with so much money.

45:18.984 --> 45:21.252
Sometimes you just have to sit
and talk with him, you know?

45:22.888 --> 45:25.490
'Cause at the end of the night

45:25.523 --> 45:27.725
the most important
interaction..

45:30.095 --> 45:31.963

[indistinct chatter]

- Hey.

45:45.977 --> 45:47.745
You look pretty.

So I gotta get out of town
for the weekend..

46:35.994 --> 46:38.029
You look much better
like that.

46:40.331 --> 46:42.500
-Oh, my God.

46:42.533 --> 46:43.902
Is that you?

46:45.470 --> 46:48.573
You're so cute.
You have glasses.

46:50.041 --> 46:53.111
Oh.
Why did you throw that away?

46:53.144 --> 46:55.180
- 'Cause it's not me anymore.

46:55.213 --> 46:58.349
* All we know

46:58.383 --> 47:01.586
* We don't know

47:01.619 --> 47:04.189
* All we know.. *

47:04.222 --> 47:06.091
- Where are we going?

47:06.124 --> 47:09.027
- I wanna take you
to one of my favorite places.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.702
-When I was younger

47:17.735 --> 47:19.804
I used to sit
by the window at night..

47:20.972 --> 47:22.607
...and say..

47:23.674 --> 47:24.775
..."Dear God..

47:24.809 --> 47:26.912

47:26.945 --> 47:30.315
"Dear God, if you want me

47:30.348 --> 47:34.119
to believe in you,
you have to show me a sign."

47:35.921 --> 47:41.192
-And did God show you a sign?
Like, like a burning bush?

47:43.728 --> 47:45.130
-No.

47:46.697 --> 47:47.832
But, um..

47:49.968 --> 47:52.037
I don't know.

47:52.070 --> 47:53.738
[both chuckle]

47:53.771 --> 47:56.474
Maybe you're not supposed to be
so demanding.

47:59.911 --> 48:02.580
Or I'll just start dealing.

48:02.613 --> 48:05.483
-It's complicated, you know?

48:05.516 --> 48:09.087
I mean, I'd rather be doing
what I'm doing

48:09.120 --> 48:12.323
than doing some
nine-to-five job.

48:14.425 --> 48:18.163
It can be exactly like dancing,
you know?

48:19.297 --> 48:21.866
It's like an addiction.

48:21.899 --> 48:24.435
I'm addicted to it.

48:24.469 --> 48:28.106
It could be like a black hole
that just pulls you..

48:29.440 --> 48:30.408
...under.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.578
And then it's very hard
to get out.

48:33.611 --> 48:35.680
And the longer you do it

48:35.713 --> 48:38.216
the harder it is.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.851
I mean, I should've stopped
a long time ago.

48:46.157 --> 48:48.293
-If you stop, I'll stop.

48:50.996 --> 48:52.863
-Good deal.

48:56.701 --> 48:58.836
Hey, look.

49:00.972 --> 49:02.440
It's peyote.

49:05.676 --> 49:08.146
You're taking with me?

49:11.882 --> 49:13.251
-Okay.

49:14.352 --> 49:15.886
-Okay.

It's cold. Come in here.

51:58.082 --> 51:59.884

52:05.990 --> 52:07.725
-I like you.

-You look nice.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.046
-Thanks, mom.

58:02.079 --> 58:03.548
- I'm heading to the store,
you want me to pick up

58:03.581 --> 58:05.616
something for you?

58:05.650 --> 58:07.384
-It's okay. I can do it.

- Okay.

[beeping]

you have a phone call.

58:22.399 --> 58:24.001
- Don't forget this.

58:27.572 --> 58:29.807
-How would you like
to pay for all this?

58:29.840 --> 58:31.676
-Cash.

-Hi, sweetie.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.643
-What's this?
-A present.

59:06.811 --> 59:09.747
-Wow. Look at that.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.949
-Well, I knew you wanted one.

59:16.987 --> 59:19.556
-Did you get a raise?
-Yup.

59:21.291 --> 59:23.227
-I'm proud of you, sweet pea.

59:57.161 --> 59:58.395
-Where you going?

59:59.496 --> 01:00:01.666
Where you've been, Pepper?
-Um..

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.601
-You know,
I've been calling you.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.038
-Yeah, I know, I, uh..

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:11.208
I, uh, I've been trying
to get you your money.

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:13.310
-Yeah. Where is it?

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.381
-Um --
-Where is the money?

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:21.618
-I, uh, I can definitely
get it to you by Friday..

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:24.254
-My fucking ass is on the
line, do you understand that?

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:27.257
I'm fucking talking to you,
Pepper.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:30.527
-Let go of me. You fuckin'..
Carlos.

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:36.300
-I can't breath.
- Pepper.

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:40.504
-I fucking warned you, Pepper.

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:42.840
-I'll get you the money.
- When?

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:45.309
-Friday.

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:51.381
-I set up a profile
and I got a good picture
and everything, but..

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:53.951
- So how was that guy
the other night?

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.886
-I mean, he was okay.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.789
He had this weird
fetishistic thing
and he started to tie me up

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:00.190
and then I was, like,
you know what

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:02.960
let's have some dinner first
or at least a snack.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.495
- Typical freaking male.

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:06.931
-He, like, was shaven
down there

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:08.232
and I thought
that was pretty gross.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.400
- I love a clean shaved guy.
- Really?

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:11.736
-How long you guys
have been living here?

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:12.837
-Well, about three years

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.840
but I'm saving up
to buy my own place.

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:18.108
-She's been saying that
for years.

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:21.812
-Hey, that coming from someone
who's shoving their day's work
up their nose.

01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:25.015
Now, give it to me.
-Look who's talking.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.316
-Where was Pepper tonight?

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.818
-She didn't feel like working.

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.319
-She didn't wanna work
because she's worried about

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.488
running into what's-his-face
from Vegas.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.224
-Who?
-That girl owes
a lot of people money.

01:01:34.258 --> 01:01:36.526
- Is she still, like,
recruiting girls for the club?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.829
-That's how she got me
started.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.903
-What do you mean
recruiting girls?

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.573
- Nothing, just like, you know

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:51.275
she gets a little commission
or something

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:53.643
but I don't know
if she's still doing that.

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:55.846
-Isn't that
how she brought you in?

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:58.849
-Come on, honey,
you know you're not the only one

01:01:58.883 --> 01:02:00.450
who's been seduced by Pepper.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:03.487
-Yeah, remember that time
when we went with her to Reno?

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.056
She gave us so many fucking
drugs, I couldn't see straight

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:08.225
for, like, what,
three days after that.

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:10.861
That girl is crazy.
- Oh, I mean,
she is hauling ass.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:14.164
Dude, dude, I thought
she was gonna bounce us right
out of the back of that thing.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.033
[chuckles]

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:21.238
-Hey, my phone died.
I was worried about you.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:23.473
What're you doing here?

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.610
-Do you recruit girls
for the club?

01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:28.979
-No.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.848
No.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:34.885
-Are you sure?
-Who said that to you?

01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:36.553
-Have you ever?
-No.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.855
-I just don't know
why they would say that. I --

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:39.790
-What?
Wh-why they would say that?

01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:41.992
Did Diana say that?

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.229
Huh?

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.865
-I'm just something that
you're playing around with?

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.266
-Of course not.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.970
-I think maybe
you should get your stuff out.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:55.505
-What?

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.407
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.376
-I just don't know
why they would say that.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.745
-Yeah, because they're fucking
doing lines of coke.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.813
Did you do coke?

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:04.048
Did you fucking get high?
-No. No.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.550
-They're a bunch
of fucking cokeheads.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:07.584
Who do you think you are?

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.819
Now that
you're a fucking stripper

01:03:08.853 --> 01:03:11.021
you think
you're some tough chick?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.097
[gunshot]

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:24.168
-Ha ha!
Can't stop us!

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:26.536
- Get it.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.873
- Yeah, yeah, she fucking
came home for reunion.

01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:30.807
I saw her.
-Oh, yeah, I saw her and --

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:32.809
-She got so fat.

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.644
-Yeah.

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:36.981
-I was like,
she can't be pregnant
'cause she's buying tampons.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:39.683
- Oh, my God.
Danny. Remember Danny?

01:03:39.716 --> 01:03:41.852
-Yeah, yeah.
-He lost all of his hair.

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:43.353
-No.
-Yeah.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.555
-Oh, that's kinda sad.
- Yeah.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.059
[gunshot]

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:50.727
- Are those new?
-Hmm.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.163
-Cute.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.034
Jenny and I were at Dairy Dream
the other day

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.903
and we were talking
to the lady at the front
counter

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.005
and she said
she hasn't seen you there.

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:02.406
- Yeah.

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:07.945
-Well, we probably
haven't met each other yet.

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:11.381
You know, just different shifts.
-Yeah.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:15.052
I thought you were there
for a while now.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:19.023

-Bye, you love birds.
-Bye.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:29.699
-Later, y'all. Later, bro.
-Hey, give me a call
when you get back tonight.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:32.302
-Ah!
-Easy there.

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:35.805
That's why you don't wear them
kind of shoes down in a quarry.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:39.944
[sighs]

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.880
What's going on?

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.750
-What do you mean?

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:50.955
-I know you got all these
clothes and jewelry..

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:52.489
...you have all this money
all of a sudden

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.424
you don't have any time
to hang out.

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:57.161
You're always too busy.

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.432
-Just a new pair of shoes
and some earrings.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.435
-You cheating on me?

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.939
-Come on.
-No?

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:11.608
Then what is it? Where're you
getting this money from?

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.910
You're working
at the Dairy Dream store?

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.215
[sighs]

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.816
-No. I'm not.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.086
- Seriously?

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:26.690
You had
to keep that from me?

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:28.825
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.294
-What, I feel like a failure,
okay?

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:34.164
-Come on, Sarah, I've told
you, you could come work for me.

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.533
Okay?

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:41.038
Hey, I could give a shit less
about that job.

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:44.708
Fuck, you can come
live with me if you want.

01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:47.477
-I know. I know.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:50.180
-Okay, then why --
-It's just..

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:52.082
-What, you wanna live
with your mom forever?

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:53.750
-No.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.997
I just feel like
we need to talk because I..

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.300
I don't know, I, I feel like

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:12.769
maybe we're going
in different directions.

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.340
Okay?

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.946
-Okay. Okay!

01:06:30.387 --> 01:06:32.122
[scoffs]

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.929
Alright, get in the car.
I'll, um, I'll drive you home.

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.965
I'm not gonna leave you here,
okay?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.733
-It's fine, I'll just walk.
- Sarah, come on. Sarah!

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.335
-I'll just walk home.
-Sarah!

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:48.305
- No.
-Sarah, get in
the fucking car!

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.706
Hey!

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:52.176
Come on!

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:55.379
Motherfucker! Goddammit!

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.310
-Hi.
- Hey.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:32.182
-I, uh...I left some things
in the shop.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.086
-You didn't have a hard time
getting in last time.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:40.124
-Okay, so that thing
at the club

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:44.128
um, that was a big
misunderstanding, you know.

01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:49.633
I don't do that.
I haven't done it in ages.

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:50.967
I..

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:55.172
I mean, I certainly
didn't feel that

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:58.342
you were gonna go and get
a job there, you know?

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.611
I..

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.782
I'm sorry.
I..

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.952
I want you to trust me.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.028
[bell chiming]

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:23.667
- So, uh, we can change
the facade, right?

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.403
There's no historical listing
on the property?
- No. No.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:30.439
The previous owner's daughter
had some emotional attachment
to the place

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:33.542
but...that's all.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:37.013
- So we got a deal?
Super Town Express
coming soon.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.618
-I can see it.
-Alright.

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:44.421
Let's go back to my office
and we'll work up the paperwork.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.356
[bells jingling]

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:50.859
[instrumental music]

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:52.261
-Wake up.

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:55.399
Wake up.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:59.303
-Mm-hmm.
-Come on, wake up.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:01.738
-Mmm. Mwah.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.139
Mwah. Mwah.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:06.710
Your face.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:08.845
Mwah.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:11.848
-They're gonna sell the store.
-Hmm?

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.850
-They found a buyer.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.886
-Yeah?

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.523
What?

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:24.961
Is that a bad thing?

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.765
-What are we doing here?

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:33.002
There's nothing here for me.

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:36.506
I wanna leave.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.875
What if we just got away? Now?

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:43.779
And made up new names,
a new story..

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:46.082
...and all those things
that we've talked about?

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.017
And I could get a job.

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:50.354
We could use the money
that I saved up.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:55.259
We could do whatever we want.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:00.063
Come on. Isn't that great?

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.802
-Sarah, I'm in trouble,
honey, you know?

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:09.639
I owe..

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:13.643
I owe someone a lot of money..

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.747
...and I can't keep
running away.

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.183
-Okay. Well, how much?

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:24.087
- No, I don't, I don't
wanna take your money.

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:27.123
I don't wanna take your money.

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:31.428
I don't wanna take your money.
- Look.

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:34.230
I don't wanna take your money.
- Look. Look.

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:37.934
Look at all of this.
That's why I've saved this.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.836
Come on.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:43.673
It's enough?

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.777
-Yeah.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:52.516
I'll pay you back. I promise.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.485
-It's for us.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:58.955
That's our freedom.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.991
-That's a lot of money.

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:04.894
Listen..

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.766
...I want you
to come with me..

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:15.038
...tonight...to Seattle, okay?

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.106
-Okay.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.242
I'll work..

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.945
...one last shift tonight
and then we can go.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:25.114
Uh, so we have a little bit
extra money.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:28.385
-One last shift?
-And you can pay that guy.

01:11:29.353 --> 01:11:32.088
-And then we can go to, uh..

01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:34.624
...Africa maybe.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:35.692
-Okay.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.696
You know it's okay.
-What?

[chuckles]
What?

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:46.770
-I feel like I could do
anything with you.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.739
I feel like..

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:51.841
...anything is possible.
