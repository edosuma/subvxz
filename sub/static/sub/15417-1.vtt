01:49.840 --> 01:51.831
(Snoring)

01:53.480 --> 01:57.075
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.951
Berlin.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.871
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.071
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.908
I heard Russian artillery
had a little part in it too, if you don't mind.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.350
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.188
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.832
The incumbent overseas.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.519
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

02:23.560 --> 02:28.031
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.672
(Gags)

02:34.120 --> 02:37.430
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

02:37.480 --> 02:40.040
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.835
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.235
Well, don't you want to see it?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.271
One thing at a time.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.148
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.760
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

03:32.800 --> 03:35.189
I don't expect it to look like a lace Valentine.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.077
Golly.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.908
(Man) Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.869
(2nd man) They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.356
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.551
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.672
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.871
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.911
I object to dollar diplomacy.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.111
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.720
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.593
If you leave the wrapper on, it's imperialism.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.235
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

04:25.280 --> 04:28.431
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.392
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

04:31.440 --> 04:34.238
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

04:34.280 --> 04:38.398
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.558
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

04:42.600 --> 04:44.397
nothing else.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.830
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

04:47.880 --> 04:52.954
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.630
It is our duty to their wives, their mothers,
their sisters, to find the facts.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.671
And if these reports are true,

04:59.720 --> 05:03.838
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.759
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.231
(Man) Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.077
(2nd man) A band and everything.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.315
(3rd man) They'll be glad to see home folks.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.755
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.157
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.555
This time it's not just VIPs.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.319
This time we're getting VIPIs.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.079
Very Important Persons Indeed.

05:43.120 --> 05:47.591
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

05:47.640 --> 05:52.111
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

05:52.160 --> 05:55.550
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Fräuleins,

05:55.600 --> 05:57.670
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

05:57.720 --> 06:00.280
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.390
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.159
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.318
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

06:09.360 --> 06:12.079
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

06:12.120 --> 06:16.238
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.192
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.037
We've got a tough job on our hands

06:21.080 --> 06:24.231
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.919
For my dough, we're on the ball.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.679
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

06:29.720 --> 06:35.511
What they've got to realise is you can't pin
sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.472
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.239
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.999
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.600
That's not fair to them or us.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.552
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

06:50.920 --> 06:54.469
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

06:54.520 --> 06:56.875
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.638
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.235
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.275
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.675
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

07:14.720 --> 07:18.315
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.511
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.348
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.077
Nice toe.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.197
The best.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.595
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

07:45.960 --> 07:48.155
([Music:] Upbeat march)

07:53.920 --> 07:56.309
(Drill sergeant) Present... arms!

08:13.600 --> 08:15.989
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

08:16.040 --> 08:20.158
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.395
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.876
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.879
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.515
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.357
Snappy little outfit you have.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.595
Thank you. I have to apologise for the band.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.631
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.240
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.193
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

08:47.240 --> 08:51.711
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.115
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.515
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.073
- May I introduce...
- I know.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.112
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.948
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.595
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.755
Delightful.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.395
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.591
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

09:16.640 --> 09:19.552
from the people
of the United States of America.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.435
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

09:24.480 --> 09:29.076
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

09:29.120 --> 09:33.750
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.075
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.715
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

09:46.760 --> 09:49.115
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.152
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.510
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.629
Captain Pringle!

09:58.040 --> 09:59.837
Captain Pringle!

10:03.760 --> 10:05.512
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.279
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.710
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

10:11.760 --> 10:15.196
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

10:15.240 --> 10:18.391
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.796
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, Iowa.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.035
Well, how is good old Iowa?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.071
62°% Republican, thank you.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.511
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.120
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.957
Be glad.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.480
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.517
It's a beauty.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.551
I didn't know it was so personal.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.991
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.635
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.116
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

11:04.160 --> 11:07.072
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.112
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.118
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.151
There's unfinished business here.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.351
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.949
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

11:22.000 --> 11:23.797
with a birthday cake on his knees.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.991
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.355
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.551
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

11:33.600 --> 11:35.716
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.878
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.672
Good to hear you talk like that.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.790
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.239
I'll be right with you.

11:45.280 --> 11:49.831
If you're a sample of the spirit
prevailing in Berlin, I feel better already.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.235
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.959
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.472
My handkerchief.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.875
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

12:07.360 --> 12:10.955
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.595
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

12:14.640 --> 12:18.155
He sent out his shorts and got back a girdle.
(Laughs)

12:19.200 --> 12:21.077
(Groans)

12:36.960 --> 12:38.951
Ask her how much.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.630
(Speaking German)

12:43.680 --> 12:45.671
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.552
(Speaking German)

13:06.360 --> 13:10.148
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.395
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

13:12.440 --> 13:15.000
No, this silver. Want steel.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.837
You want steel.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.998
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.828
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.235
(Cackles) Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

13:30.280 --> 13:32.271
- How much?
- $700.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.590
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.838
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

13:49.880 --> 13:52.872
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

13:52.920 --> 13:55.718
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

13:55.760 --> 13:59.036
- How much for the mattress?
- (Speaking German)

14:00.960 --> 14:03.155
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.156
Look what you can get for it.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.078
(Speaking German)

14:09.600 --> 14:12.751
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.190
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.310
(All speaking German)

15:38.360 --> 15:40.351
(Brakes squeal)

15:40.400 --> 15:42.391
(Honks horn)

16:11.120 --> 16:13.111
Yoo-hoo!

16:14.080 --> 16:16.833
Erika! Erika!

16:27.240 --> 16:29.231
(Whistling cheerfully)

16:32.600 --> 16:34.556
(Speaks German)

16:35.680 --> 16:38.240
Sit down, Johnny.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.031
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.152
Johnny.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.555
Johnny, what are you doing?

17:07.599 --> 17:10.637
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.830
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

17:13.880 --> 17:17.077
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

17:17.119 --> 17:18.758
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.588
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.675
Ohh...

17:24.720 --> 17:28.838
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.031
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

17:32.080 --> 17:35.231
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.398
You don't know how good. I bought
you another present. You're not gonna get it.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.591
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.473
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

17:46.760 --> 17:50.992
Johnny... (Speaks German)

17:51.040 --> 17:53.759
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.588
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

17:57.640 --> 18:01.519
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.950
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.195
then the victory celebrations,

18:07.240 --> 18:09.231
then the bombing.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.271
All the furniture burnt.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.117
See?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.116
(Springs crash and boing)

18:15.160 --> 18:18.470
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.511
No mattress will help you sleep.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.949
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.797
I have a good conscience.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.991
I have a new Führer now... you.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.314
Heil, Johnny.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.999
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.837
You'll bruise your lips.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.031
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

18:37.840 --> 18:40.559
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.033
(Knock at door)

18:42.080 --> 18:43.672
Who's that?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.711
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.591
- Yes.
- Your name Schlütow?

18:56.640 --> 18:59.359
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schlütow?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.391
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.839
Yes, I live here.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.678
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

19:05.720 --> 19:09.315
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schlütow?

19:10.360 --> 19:12.999
My name is Erika von Schlütow.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.031
- A von?
- She's a von.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.878
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.639
- What do you want?
- A little information.

19:20.680 --> 19:25.515
It says here that a certain Erika Schlütow...
von Schlütow, pardon I...

19:25.560 --> 19:28.711
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19 - von - 35.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.991
Go on, gentlemen.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.271
It says that Miss von Schlütow
was ordered over a month ago

19:35.320 --> 19:38.039
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.231
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.795
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

19:44.840 --> 19:49.675
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.711
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.150
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.395
I'm on the white list now.

19:58.240 --> 20:03.075
With that record? If you make the white list,
we'll make the hit parade.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.714
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

20:05.760 --> 20:09.150
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.919
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.757
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.791
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.637
We've had a lot of people to check.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.070
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.510
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.358
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.039
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.552
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

20:45.320 --> 20:49.438
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

20:49.480 --> 20:53.268
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

20:53.320 --> 20:57.108
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

20:57.160 --> 21:00.948
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.151
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.792
I was.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.833
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.871
Everything is dangerous.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.391
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.077
See you, baby.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.911
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.757
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.791
And hairpins.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.628
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.960
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.759
Yahoo!

21:40.160 --> 21:41.991
(Siren wailing)

21:44.000 --> 21:46.070
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

21:46.120 --> 21:49.430
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.438
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.955
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.118
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.879
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

22:03.920 --> 22:08.994
They used to say it's the first time in history
a man gave himself the hotfoot.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.031
(Siren wailing)

22:13.320 --> 22:18.155
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.590
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.791
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.035
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

22:27.080 --> 22:30.675
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.359
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

22:33.400 --> 22:36.995
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.600
Now, let's look at the Wilhelmstraße.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.153
(Siren wailing)

22:41.200 --> 22:45.034
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Führer fixed himself up a duplex.

22:45.080 --> 22:49.198
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.231
Underneath is a concrete basement,

22:51.280 --> 22:54.716
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.752
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

22:59.080 --> 23:03.915
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.111
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

23:09.560 --> 23:13.678
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

23:13.720 --> 23:18.191
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.391
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.355
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.551
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

23:48.600 --> 23:51.558
completely burned out by incendiaries.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.239
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.032
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

24:15.080 --> 24:20.154
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

24:20.200 --> 24:25.274
They blew it up themselves.
The idea was to destroy all their records.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.791
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.597
Excuse me.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.678
Well.

24:59.560 --> 25:03.348
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.518
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

25:07.560 --> 25:11.758
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.395
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

25:15.440 --> 25:17.510
and teach them to beep at the referee.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.199
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.954
(Cheering)

25:25.000 --> 25:28.788
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.150
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.760
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.952
- (Shouts in German)
- (All yelling)

25:46.040 --> 25:48.838
(Man) Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

25:48.880 --> 25:51.235
(Whistling)

25:51.280 --> 25:54.078
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

26:03.160 --> 26:05.549
(Laughing) No, no, no.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.798
Come on. What's the matter with you two?
Just a little Spazierfahren in the park.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.515
Nein, we don't bicycle. We automobile.
(Both laugh)

26:14.040 --> 26:16.600
Automobile? You got yourselves officers?

26:16.640 --> 26:20.030
- (Speaking German)
- French officers.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.675
OK. So they got an automobile
but we got the candy bar.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.711
(Speaking German)

26:29.640 --> 26:32.154
Ah, your Führer's moustache.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.072
Hey, Doctor, I got a lady on the balcony.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.912
Size 14.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.315
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

26:46.360 --> 26:50.751
Hey, Fräulein! Stop, Fräulein!

26:52.920 --> 26:55.639
- Guten afternoon, Fräulein.
- Hello, Fräulein.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.477
(Giggles)

26:57.520 --> 27:00.478
Das is my friend Brigadier General Mike.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.715
And das is mein Freund,
Lieutenant General Joe.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.034
Jawohl.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.435
You know, you're a nice little strudel.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.675
Hey, hands off. I saw her first.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.755
(Giggles)

27:09.800 --> 27:12.519
Fräulein, would you like
a little Spaßmachen,

27:12.560 --> 27:16.269
- Biertrinken and Tanzen making?
- Jawohl.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.710
She must be tetched in the wool.
All she can say is, "Jawohl".

27:19.760 --> 27:22.797
(All laugh)

27:22.840 --> 27:26.958
[Music:] Fräulein, Fräulein, willst du ein candy bar

27:27.000 --> 27:31.118

[Music:] But here we squares is millionaires,

27:40.120 --> 27:43.112
Don't give her that candy bar yet.
Are you crazy?

27:43.160 --> 27:46.948
- I ain't giving. I'm just showing.
- Say, was ist your name?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.117
(Speaking German)

27:50.160 --> 27:52.355
- Er, Gretchen.
- Gretchen what?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.469
(Giggles)

27:53.520 --> 27:56.671
- Gesundheit. Gretchen Gesundheit.
- Gesundheit!

27:56.720 --> 27:59.871

We're fraternising with a sneeze.

with percussion)

28:47.360 --> 28:50.158
- I'm sorry. It's five packs now.
- Four packs.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.590
Five packs for champagne,
three for wine, one for beer.

28:53.640 --> 28:57.553
This is eine kleine clip joint. Here's your tip.

28:57.600 --> 29:01.593
How do you like these prices? We got
to write Congress to boost our PX ration.

29:01.640 --> 29:06.111
Fat chance. All them schmoes think about
is coal strikes, flood control, United Nations.

29:06.160 --> 29:09.755
What's Congress? A bunch of salesmen
with their foot in the right door.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.633
For my dough, you can have
Congress and the Senate.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.636
- I'll take it.
- You got it.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.433

29:18.920 --> 29:20.319
Hey!

29:23.960 --> 29:26.315

29:31.920 --> 29:34.480

Hey, Gretchen, you live with your mother?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.357
What business is it of yours?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.755
Look, what do you want, the whole family?

29:42.800 --> 29:45.872
You pulling a trick like the one
with the Schultz sisters?

29:45.920 --> 29:48.275
Nein, nein, you Soldaten, United States.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.195
[Music:] I take Spam

33:26.240 --> 33:29.835
[Music:] To you for your K ration

33:30.640 --> 33:32.835
[Music:] Compassion

33:32.880 --> 33:36.998
[Music:] And maybe an inkling

33:37.040 --> 33:41.033
[Music:] A twinkling of real sympathy

33:41.080 --> 33:43.435
[Music:] I'm selling out

33:43.480 --> 33:45.835
[Music:] Take all I've got

33:45.880 --> 33:49.668
[Music:] Ambitions, conviction, the works

33:50.920 --> 33:53.115
[Music:] Why not?

33:53.160 --> 33:55.151
[Music:] Enjoy these goods

33:56.480 --> 34:01.873
[Music:] For, boy, these goods... are hot [Music:]

34:01.920 --> 34:05.356
(Applause and cheering)

34:05.400 --> 34:08.119
(Yelling in German)

34:12.400 --> 34:15.277
(Drum flourish with each throw)

34:17.480 --> 34:22.713
Boy, that's strudel. That's the kind of pastry
makes you drool on your bib.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.911
You know what they say?
She was up there with them big Nazis.

34:25.960 --> 34:30.078
Right in the major league.
She was Goebbels' girl or Göring's.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.510
- How did she get away with it?
- Just look at her.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.199
- She's hooked herself some big brass.
- Who?

34:36.239 --> 34:40.313
All I know is, some big shot's
running interference for her.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.955
- ([Music:] Jaunty tune)
- (Speaks German)

34:44.000 --> 34:45.399
Jawohl.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.870
Listen, if anybody's dancing...
Come on, Gesundheit.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.155
- What's the matter?
- Let go of me, you ape.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.033
- What kind of language...
- I said ape and I meant ape.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.832
Hey! Hey!

35:19.080 --> 35:21.674
- Where did you get that cake?
- (Joe) Hey, Mike.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.711
I demand to know where you got that cake.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.751
(Man) What you want?

35:25.800 --> 35:28.951
Where'd this restaurant get food?
Our business, not yours.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.399
I'm making it my business.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.431
I happen to know all about that cake

35:34.480 --> 35:37.631
and I am a Congresswoman
of the United States of America.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.959
- Some strudel you picked.
- Yeah, let's go.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.315
Put back that slice of the cake.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.158
Take out the knife.
I want to know what it is doing here.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.395
- It is being eaten.
- That's enough.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.431
- This cake is confiscated.
- Hello.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.870
- How do you do? So that's where it is.
- What do you know about this?

35:57.920 --> 36:00.036
Very little. It was stolen out of my Jeep.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.992
- It was?
- Stolen and sold on the black market.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.600
They'll steal anything around here.

36:05.640 --> 36:09.235
- When I think of that girl back in Iowa...
- Yeah.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.840
I'll take care of this. Don't trouble yourself.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.998
Thank you. Will you also take care
of a pair of disgusting soldiers

36:16.040 --> 36:18.759
who should be stood up against a wall and...

36:19.760 --> 36:21.159
Oh.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.273
I want you to find them.
They're medium height. One is a little taller.

36:25.320 --> 36:29.438
Their names are Mike and Joe and
they're in uniforms with US on the collar.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.754
Perfect sense, ma'am.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.314
Now, what exactly is
the name of this sewer?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.918
- The Lorelei.
- Address?

36:34.960 --> 36:38.475
- Number 15, Hagenbachstraße.
- Are there other sewers like this?

36:38.520 --> 36:42.035
- Three or four but this is the best.
- What is the name of that woman?

36:42.080 --> 36:43.798
- What woman?
- The singer here.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.877
Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.310
- Erika what?
- Erika von Schlütow.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.759
Why do you ask about her?

36:51.800 --> 36:56.271
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.515
Schlütow? How do you spell it?

36:58.560 --> 37:00.551
Schlütow, with an umlaut.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.591
I thought so.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.678
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

37:08.720 --> 37:11.632
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.478
We've tried to turn it into a civilised state.

37:14.520 --> 37:18.115
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

37:18.160 --> 37:21.311
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.148
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.839
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.917
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.350
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.790
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.637
That was ten months ago.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.798
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

37:43.840 --> 37:47.435
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.596
But there is a new will to live.

37:49.640 --> 37:54.111
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

37:54.160 --> 37:58.278
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.880
They had their first free election in 14 years.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.354
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.551
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

38:07.560 --> 38:12.031
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.275
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

38:14.320 --> 38:17.710
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.320
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

38:20.360 --> 38:24.990
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.837
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.475
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

38:30.520 --> 38:33.159
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.351
Colonel, we buy every word of it, all of us.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.913
I don't.

38:38.880 --> 38:43.317
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.750
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.995
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

38:49.040 --> 38:51.235
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

38:51.280 --> 38:55.068
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

38:55.120 --> 38:57.315
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.873
What are you driving at?

38:58.920 --> 39:03.550
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.751
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

39:06.800 --> 39:11.191
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.835
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

39:14.880 --> 39:17.872
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.639
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

39:20.680 --> 39:24.070
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.953
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

39:27.000 --> 39:31.437
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.631
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

39:34.680 --> 39:38.912
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.679
Gls consorting with German Fräuleins...

39:41.720 --> 39:43.153
Fraternisation is legal.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.875
...in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.668
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

39:51.720 --> 39:54.757
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.837
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

39:57.880 --> 40:01.475
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

40:01.520 --> 40:05.638
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

40:05.680 --> 40:08.592
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

40:08.640 --> 40:13.031
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schlütow,

40:13.080 --> 40:18.074
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 Hagenbachstraße.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.678
How can a creature...

40:24.880 --> 40:27.440
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

40:27.480 --> 40:31.268
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.517
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

40:34.560 --> 40:39.031
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

40:39.080 --> 40:42.470
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

40:42.520 --> 40:48.072
but I never let go until the president of that
particular ship company wound up in jail,

40:48.120 --> 40:51.112
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

40:53.640 --> 40:56.632
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.956
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.035
Gerhard.

41:01.080 --> 41:05.551
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.909
(Chastises in German)

41:07.960 --> 41:11.236
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

41:11.280 --> 41:15.751
No food, Bürschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.791
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

41:17.840 --> 41:18.875
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.639
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.036
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

41:25.080 --> 41:28.675
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.915
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.757
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.358
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitän.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.277
Auf Wiedersehen.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.311
Come, Bürschchen.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.112
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

41:50.160 --> 41:52.720
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.352
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.595
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.757
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.200
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.197
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

42:22.240 --> 42:24.231
l-E or E-I at the end?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.872
E-I.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.717
Thank you.

42:30.160 --> 42:34.278
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

42:34.320 --> 42:37.517
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.118
Now, please...

42:39.160 --> 42:41.720
With one single exception, you.

42:42.680 --> 42:43.795
Thank you, ma'am.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.035
I trust you because we're both Iowans.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.675
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

42:49.720 --> 42:52.075
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.315
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.315
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.588
So it is.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.119
Captain, I need your help.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.994
I want some additional data
on Fräulein von Schlütow.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.473
The one with the umlaut.

43:06.520 --> 43:10.149
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.795
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

43:13.840 --> 43:16.479
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nürnberg.

43:16.520 --> 43:19.671
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.517
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.393
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

43:24.440 --> 43:27.079
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

43:27.120 --> 43:30.032
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.878
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.559
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.592
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

43:38.640 --> 43:41.200
so I sent for the film from the Signal Corp.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.197
(Pringle) The Week In Pictures.

43:50.040 --> 43:53.191
This is a little Nazi get-together in Breslau.

43:58.520 --> 44:02.308
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.912
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

44:09.960 --> 44:12.349
(Frost) They fiddled big while Berlin burned.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.073
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

44:18.560 --> 44:23.236
(Frost) Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.794
(Pringle) Must be that German willpower.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.274
(Frost) Who's that man?
(Pringle) I think it's Birgel.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.788
(Frost) Who?
(Pringle) Hans Otto Birgel.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.831
(Frost) Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.316
(Pringle) He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

44:36.360 --> 44:42.037
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- (Frost) An important party member?

44:42.080 --> 44:43.877
(Pringle) So-so.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.878
(Frost) Well, she must be his girlfriend.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.559
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

44:49.600 --> 44:52.478
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

45:17.920 --> 45:20.115
(Frost) That's enough. Thank you.

45:22.280 --> 45:26.273
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.357
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

45:29.400 --> 45:32.551
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.795
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

45:34.840 --> 45:37.400
What would you suggest, shave her head?

45:37.440 --> 45:39.032
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

45:39.080 --> 45:42.675
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

45:42.720 --> 45:46.110
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.957
Incredible as it may seem.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.195
Now, let's use some common sense.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.835
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.871
- Granted?
- Granted.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.275
Of course the association is undercover.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.232
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

46:01.280 --> 46:05.068
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.111
Very logical.

46:07.160 --> 46:10.550
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.397
Smart idea.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.159
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

46:15.200 --> 46:18.351
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.960
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.390
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

46:24.440 --> 46:27.876
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.275
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

46:30.320 --> 46:33.915
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.757
You'll go to the General?

46:35.800 --> 46:39.793
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

46:40.640 --> 46:43.791
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heater.

46:55.640 --> 46:59.030
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.799
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

47:01.840 --> 47:05.116
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.720
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.751
Does the CIO know about this?

47:12.920 --> 47:16.071
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

47:16.120 --> 47:17.712
There isn't even any back wall.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.752
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

47:20.800 --> 47:23.872
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.471
Only we know better.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.036
Pickled peaches.

47:34.200 --> 47:37.749
I bet you miss Iowa. I do already.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.351
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

47:42.400 --> 47:45.278
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

47:45.320 --> 47:48.039
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

47:48.080 --> 47:52.551
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called Iwo Jima Boulevard.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.751
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

47:55.800 --> 47:59.395
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

47:59.440 --> 48:02.000
The town collected $2,000 to hire a painter.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.191
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.435
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.357
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

48:09.400 --> 48:12.995
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.679
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.153
(Pringle) Hm.

48:17.200 --> 48:21.557
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take Iowa seriously, don't you?

48:21.600 --> 48:23.955
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

48:24.000 --> 48:25.433
Mm-hm.

48:25.480 --> 48:28.870
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.512
It's getting a little chilly.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.950
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.069
What happened?

48:35.120 --> 48:38.271
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.471
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.431
(Horn honks)

48:50.840 --> 48:52.671
(Key clinks)

48:52.720 --> 48:54.312
What's that?

48:54.360 --> 48:57.079
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.680
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.517
Metallic?

49:06.920 --> 49:08.717
Look, it's a key.

49:08.760 --> 49:10.955
A key? Whatever for?

49:11.000 --> 49:14.151
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.555
You know more about
these things than I do.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.591
(Erika) Johnny? Johnny?

49:23.360 --> 49:25.351
Where are you, Johnny?

49:26.160 --> 49:27.593
Johnny?

49:31.240 --> 49:34.391
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

49:34.440 --> 49:36.635
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

49:36.680 --> 49:39.831
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

49:39.880 --> 49:41.871
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.911
Yes, that would simplify it.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.996
(Door opening)

49:58.360 --> 49:59.759
Johnny.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.552
I... don't know who you refer to.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.192
I am Captain Pringle

50:07.240 --> 50:11.358
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.197
Good evening.

50:14.240 --> 50:17.038
- You are Erika von Schlütow?
- I am.

50:17.080 --> 50:20.709
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

50:20.760 --> 50:24.230
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.
