IT WAS A DREADFUL FLIGHT--

02:24.583 --> 02:26.083
DREADFUL STAFF,
DREADFUL FOOD.

02:26.125 --> 02:28.041
I'M GONNA MAKE A COMPLAINT
TO WILSON.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.542
RIGHT. (clears throat)

02:29.583 --> 02:32.041
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU MOVED TO THIS PLACE,

02:32.083 --> 02:33.583

02:33.625 --> 02:35.041
YES, ABOUT THAT.

ACTUALLY CAME TO VISIT. UH--

BUT THEY'RE SMILING,
THEY'RE DRINKING,

03:05.583 --> 03:08.667
THEY'RE CHATTING
ABOUT FLOWERS.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.667
HMM. TRUST ME, THEY ARE NOT
CHATTING ABOUT FLOWERS.

03:11.709 --> 03:14.333

03:14.375 --> 03:16.542
WE LEARN IT
AT AN EARLY AGE.

03:16.583 --> 03:19.125

03:21.625 --> 03:24.542
BUT THIS TIME,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

03:24.583 --> 03:27.792
MAYBE I'M CRAZY. I MEAN,
MAYBE EVERYTHING IS FINE,

03:27.834 --> 03:30.959
WHICH WOULD BE CREEPY
BECAUSE NOTHING IS EVER FINE.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.166
OH, HERE SHE COMES.
AH, MRS. MONTGOMERY.

03:33.208 --> 03:36.041
NOW, SAMUEL, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU

03:36.083 --> 03:37.750

03:37.792 --> 03:41.458
YES, MRS. MONTGOM--
BIZZY. MA'AM.

03:43.083 --> 03:45.208
WHAT IS THAT?

03:45.250 --> 03:49.041
MILO. I'VE DECIDED TO
GIVE UP MEN AND GET A CAT.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.625
DON'T SAY THAT.
THAT'S SO SAD.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.417
PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE YOU.

03:53.458 --> 03:56.041
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO
LOCK IT UP OR SOMETHING.

03:56.083 --> 03:59.917
WELL, IF YOUR FATHER AND I
ARE GONNA BE STAYING HERE...
STAY HERE?

03:59.959 --> 04:02.625
LET ME JUST

04:02.667 --> 04:06.375

04:17.000 --> 04:18.959
(Charlotte) DELL,
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.208
I-I DON'T KNOW. THE HOUSE,
IT JUST EXPLODED.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.083
IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN A GAS LEAK.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S OKAY.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.041
(man) 24-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,
EXTENSIVE SECOND-

04:26.083 --> 04:28.083

04:35.333 --> 04:37.458
ON MY COUNT. READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.041
ONE, TWO, THREE.
I NEED HIGH-FLOW 0-2.
I'M GONNA NEED A BLOOD GAS

04:40.083 --> 04:42.041
AND A CARBOXYHEMOGLOBIN.
WE'RE ON IT, COOPER.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.041
I-I TRIED TO GET 'EM
BOTH OUT, BUT--BUT THE FLAMES--

04:44.083 --> 04:46.250
I COULD HEAR HEATHER SCREAMING,
BUT I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING,

04:46.291 --> 04:49.166
SO I GOT BETSEY. BY THE TIME
I GOT TO HEATHER, SHE...

04:49.208 --> 04:51.709
I-I COULD--I-I COULDN'T
GET THEM BOTH.
DELL, YOU DID
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.041
LET'S GET A LITER
OF LACTATED RINGERS.
HEY, DO YOU MIND? YOU'RE
INTERFERING WITH OUR PROTOCOL.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.875
OKAY, GUYS.
YOU HAVE TO LET MY TEAM WORK.

04:57.917 --> 05:00.458
THEY DO THIS EVERY DAY.
(Cooper)
IT'S NOT DELL EVERY DAY.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.041
I KNOW THAT.
NOW STEP BACK, BOTH OF YOU.
I-I NEED TO BE
WITH BOTH OF THEM.

05:03.083 --> 05:06.041
WHAT DO I--
PETE, GO WITH HEATHER.
YOU GO WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

05:06.083 --> 05:09.375
OKAY, LET'S MOVE.
I'LL GET YOU AN UPDATE AS SOON
AS I CAN, DELL. LET'S GO.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.959
(Dell)
PLEASE DON'T LET HER DIE.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.959
(man) GET OUT OF THE WAY NOW.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
(Charlotte) LET'S GO,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

05:19.417 --> 05:21.417
(screaming)

05:21.458 --> 05:23.417
OKAY, HEATHER.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.417
NO! BETSEY!
HEATHER, YOU'RE--

05:25.458 --> 05:27.417
WHERE'S BETSEY?!
YOU NEED TO KEEP
THE MASK ON.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.417
NO!
HEATHER, YOU NEED
TO KEEP THE MASK ON.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.041
WHERE'S BETSEY?!
BETSEY IS ALIVE.
SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.417
AAH!
SHE'S IN THE E.R.
COOPER IS WORKING ON HER.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.291
DELL IS WITH HER. NOW YOU NEED
TO KEEP THE MASK ON.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.834
SHE'S GOT SECOND-
AND THIRD-DEGREE BURNS

05:39.875 --> 05:42.041
OVER 60% OF HER BODY.

05:42.083 --> 05:45.083
HER LUNGS HAVE SUSTAINED
SEVERE INHALATION INJURIES.
WE SHOULD HAVE
AN ECMO UNIT STANDING BY.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.834
I'VE ALREADY ORDERED IT.
LET'S GIVE HER MORPHINE.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.291
DO YOU KNOW HER WELL?
I USED TO WORK
WITH HER HUSBAND.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.500
WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS?
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

05:52.542 --> 05:55.875
30% CHANCE OF SURVIVAL.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:01.667 --> 06:03.834
DELL, I'M SO SORRY.

06:03.875 --> 06:07.041
IS THERE ANYTHING--
ANYTHING WE CAN DO?
I--I'M SUPPOSED TO DELIVER
THE HIGGINS BABY.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.000
THEY'RE GONNA
BE WAITING FOR ME.
(Naomi) I-I ALREADY
TOOK CARE OF IT.

06:10.041 --> 06:13.166
THE ON-CALL DOCTOR
IS GONNA DELIVER. IT'S FINE.
OKAY.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.166
DID I GIVE MY INSURANCE CARD?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.333
THEY'RE GONNA--
THEY'RE GONNA NEED IT.

06:17.375 --> 06:21.166
DELL, I'LL--I'LL MAKE SURE THEY
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION, OKAY?

06:21.208 --> 06:23.625
(knock on door)
HEY.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.750
HEY, DELL, I TOOK A LOOK
AT BETSEY'S C.T. SCAN.

06:26.792 --> 06:28.792
SHE HAS A MODERATE
BRAIN CONTUSION

06:28.834 --> 06:31.041
AND SHE ALSO HAS
CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING.

06:31.083 --> 06:34.208
NOW MOST PEOPLE
WAKE UP IN A FEW HOURS,

06:34.250 --> 06:38.291
BUT BECAUSE SHE'S SO SMALL,
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE LONGER.

06:41.083 --> 06:44.875
HEATHER--HOW IS SHE?
I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE
ON HEATHER FROM PETE YET.

06:44.917 --> 06:48.041
BUT THEY KNOW
WHAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.417
OKAY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO OUTSIDE.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.250
JUST SAY IT.
UM...

06:53.291 --> 06:55.166
HEATHER WAS COOKING METH.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.125
THEY THINK IT WAS ETHER.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.208
DELL, WE'VE GOT HEATHER
STABILIZED.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.041
SHE'S ASKING FOR YOU. I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE BETSEY,

07:04.083 --> 07:05.875
BUT IT...

07:16.291 --> 07:17.542
HEATHER.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.917
DON'T TRY TO SPEAK.

07:20.959 --> 07:22.291
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

07:22.333 --> 07:25.291
(moaning)
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

07:25.333 --> 07:27.000
GOOD.

07:30.792 --> 07:34.750
I HOPE YOU DIE, BITCH.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.792
YOU ALMOST KILLED
MY DAUGHTER.

07:37.834 --> 07:41.041
I HOPE YOU DIE
A MISERABLE...

07:41.083 --> 07:44.667
PAINFUL, AGONIZING DEATH.

07:44.709 --> 07:47.041

YOU'RE ALMOST THERE,
HEATHER. ALMOST THERE.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.917
AFTER THIS, WE'RE GONNA
TEST YOUR LUNG FUNCTION.

08:01.959 --> 08:06.000
HELP US DECIDE
OUR NEXT MOVE, OKAY?
HE HATES ME. HE WANTS ME TO DIE.
JUST LET ME DIE.

08:06.041 --> 08:08.041
HEATHER, LISTEN TO ME.
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.000
DELL DOESN'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.000
HE'S UPSET
AND HE'S WORRIED ABOUT BETSEY.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.000
BUT YOU GOTTA FIGHT, OKAY?
YOU GOTTA FIGHT.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.041
GIVE ME MORE DRUGS. PLEASE.
JUST MAKE IT STOP!

08:16.083 --> 08:17.583
OKAY, HEATHER.
OH!

08:19.542 --> 08:22.333
HE SAID THAT?
(Violet) HE'S UPSET.

08:22.375 --> 08:25.333
IT'S HIS WAY OF DEALING
WITH A TRAGIC SITUATION.
TO TELL SOMEBODY

08:25.375 --> 08:28.000
WHO'S FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIFE
YOU WANT THEM TO DIE?

08:28.041 --> 08:31.125
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE DID.
THAT'S CROSSING A LINE.
HE COULDN'T HAVE MEANT IT.

08:31.166 --> 08:35.125
DO YOU GUYS THINK HE KNEW THAT
HEATHER WAS DOING DRUGS AGAIN?

08:35.166 --> 08:38.291
(clears throat)

08:38.333 --> 08:40.041
I GOT YOU ALL COFFEE.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.834
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON HEATHER.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.125
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DRUGS.

08:48.166 --> 08:51.166
I WOULDN'T HAVE PUT BETSEY
IN DANGER LIKE THAT IF I KNEW...

08:51.208 --> 08:53.041
SINCE YOU
WERE ALL WONDERING.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.041
DELL, NO O--
NO ONE THOUGHT--

08:55.083 --> 08:57.041
IT'S COLD IN HERE.
SHE HATES THE COLD.

08:57.083 --> 09:00.792
YOU KNOW, SHE'S ALWAYS ASKING
FOR MORE BLANKETS AT NIGHT.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.834
(sighs)

09:05.875 --> 09:08.041
SHE NEEDS ANOTHER BLANKET.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, DELL?

09:08.083 --> 09:10.625
WHY DON'T--WE'RE GONNA GO
AND TALK TO A NURSE

09:10.667 --> 09:13.000
AND SEE IF WE CAN
GET SOME MORE, OKAY?

09:15.083 --> 09:17.417
GOD, CAN YOU BELIEVE
ALL THIS?

09:17.458 --> 09:19.583
I KNOW.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.041
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.041
I-I FEEL LIKE I REALLY
SHOULD'VE PUSHED HIM HARDER.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.041
I SHOULD'VE MADE HIM
REALLY THINK

09:25.083 --> 09:27.166
ABOUT LETTING HEATHER
BACK INTO THEIR LIVES.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.166
NAI, THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY,

09:29.208 --> 09:32.458
NOTHING ANYONE
COULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY.
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.834
HEY, WAIT. LET--LET--LET'S JUST
HAVE A 1-MINUTE MENTAL BREAK.
SURE. MAYA?

09:35.875 --> 09:40.583
SAME--HATING ME AND LOVING
PINK OR RINK OR DINK.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.500
(laughs)
WHATEVER HIS NAME IS.
BIZZY?

09:42.542 --> 09:44.458
THE SAME--
COCKTAILS, COLD SMILES--

09:44.500 --> 09:46.041
YOU KNOW, MATERNAL.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.291
SOMETHING'S GOING ON, BUT--

09:48.333 --> 09:50.041
(cell phone rings and beeps)

09:50.083 --> 09:51.083
BIZZY.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.041
YES.

09:53.083 --> 09:56.041
I WILL PICK UP SOME MORE
ON THE WAY HOME.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.041
BYE.
CRISIS?

09:58.083 --> 10:00.291
MORE GIN.
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.875
ME, TOO.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.000
(sighs)

10:05.125 --> 10:06.417
(keys jangle)

10:06.458 --> 10:08.750
ADDIE.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.625
SUSAN? WHAT...

10:10.667 --> 10:13.542
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
(laughs) HI.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.709
OH, MY GOD. YOU LOOK GREAT.
YOU LOOK...

10:15.750 --> 10:18.709
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.
OH, ABOUT EIGHT YEARS,
AND I LOOK A MESS.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.750
YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHER'S SKIN.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.750
OH.
SO HOW IS IT?

10:22.792 --> 10:24.125
SHE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.
MM.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.709
HE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU WORK FOR THEM.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.333
REMEMBER TO BREATHE
AND MANY COCKTAILS.
(laughs)

10:30.375 --> 10:32.458
(laughs)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:32.500 --> 10:36.000
YOU KNOW BIZZY'S RULE--
WHEREVER SHE GOES, I GO.
SUSAN, WHY IS SHE HERE?

10:36.041 --> 10:40.041
I HAVE NO IDEA.
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW?

10:40.083 --> 10:42.458

HEY.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.875
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.875
SUSAN.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.333
I BROUGHT THE DOCUMENTS
FOR THE HOUSTON CHARITY BALL.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.000
HELLO, CAPTAIN.

11:03.083 --> 11:07.750
WHO WANTS... A DRINK?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.166
EXCUSE ME.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.959
YOU'RE TURNING DOWN DRINKS?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.125
GOOD NIGHT, ADDISON.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.542
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH DELL?
NO, NO.

11:26.583 --> 11:30.125
SUSAN--SHE RUNS THE FAMILY
OFFICE. DO YOU REMEMBER HER?

11:30.166 --> 11:33.041
I LIKE HER. I MEAN, SHE'S CLOSE
IN AGE TO ME, YOU KNOW,

11:33.083 --> 11:35.041
AND SHE WOULD
DO THINGS FOR ME.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.041
SHE WOULD DEAL
WITH MY MOTHER FOR ME.

11:37.083 --> 11:41.041
A-A-ANYWAY, SHE'S BEEN WORKING
FOR US FOR 20 YEARS.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.375
SHE'S LIKE ONE OF THE FAMILY.
SHE SHOWS UP HERE AND...

11:43.417 --> 11:45.041
AND WHAT IS IT?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.375
I THINK THE CAPTAIN'S
SLEEPING WITH HER.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.375
I THINK THAT'S WHY
HE SENT FOR BIZZY,

11:49.417 --> 11:52.041
BECAUSE ANYWHERE BIZZY GOES,
SUSAN GOES, TOO.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.041
HE INVITED HIS WIFE OUT

11:54.083 --> 11:56.583
SO THAT SHE WOULD BRING
HIS MISTRESS?

11:56.625 --> 11:58.875
THAT'S MY FATHER.
AND MY MOTHER TRUSTS HER.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.917
I MEAN,
SHE LIVES ON THE ESTATE.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.875
YOU KNOW,
AND NOW HE DOES THIS? UGH.

12:02.917 --> 12:05.417
I MEAN,
RIGHT UNDER BIZZY'S NOSE.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.291

MY HOUSE. UH, I NEED A DRINK.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.500
NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T.
OH, I DO.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.041

TELL THOSE PEOPLE TO LEAVE

12:13.083 --> 12:15.458

12:33.125 --> 12:34.959

21:43.083 --> 21:44.959
MRS. MONTGOMERY.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.333
HELLO.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.375
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

21:50.417 --> 21:53.083
AND WHAT DO YOU DO HERE AT MY
DAUGHTER'S PRACTICE, VIOLET?

21:53.125 --> 21:56.041
I-I--I'M A PSYCHIATRIST.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.959
INTERESTING.
YEAH.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.041
HAVE YOU MET MY HUSBAND--
THE CAPTAIN?

22:01.083 --> 22:03.709
UM... I...

22:03.750 --> 22:05.959
YEAH, UH, ONCE OR TWICE.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
DID YOU MEET HIM ONCE
OR DID YOU MEET HIM TWICE?

22:12.375 --> 22:13.500
TWICE.

22:13.542 --> 22:17.041
YES, I BELIEVE TWICE.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.625
(elevator bell dings)

22:28.750 --> 22:31.709
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD DO SOME SHOPPING TODAY

22:31.750 --> 22:34.542
AND THEN HAVE LUNCH.

22:39.667 --> 22:42.166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:42.208 --> 22:44.750
OKAY, THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.625
MOTHER, I'M JUST...

22:46.667 --> 22:48.750
I'M SO SORRY

22:48.792 --> 22:51.959
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,
ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.959
WHO DID WHAT TO ME?
LOOK, I KNOW, I KNOW.
WE DON'T TALK.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.959
WE CHAT ABOUT, UH, FLOWERS

22:57.000 --> 23:00.041
AND PRETEND THAT
HE'S NOT... CHEATING ON YOU.

23:00.083 --> 23:03.333
BUT LET'S NOT DO THAT ANYMORE.
LET'S FACE IT.

23:03.375 --> 23:06.542
I'LL FACE IT WITH YOU.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.542
YOU'VE GOTTA BE LONELY
AND--AND ALONE AND--

23:08.583 --> 23:11.291
ADDISON,
THIS IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.041
IT'S NOT MY...
YOU'RE MY MOTHER.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.667
EXACTLY.

23:15.709 --> 23:18.083
LET'S NOT DISCUSS
THESE THINGS.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.625
NO, WE HAVE TO.

23:21.875 --> 23:25.041
YOU'RE WRONG...
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

23:25.083 --> 23:28.208
I'M WRONG. BIZZY, DON'T...

23:28.250 --> 23:32.583
HE DROVE YOU
TO KISS ANOTHER WOMAN.

23:32.625 --> 23:35.083
(sighs)

23:35.125 --> 23:39.000
SUSAN... HAS BEEN WITH ME
FOR 20 YEARS.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.375
YES, I KNOW.

23:40.417 --> 23:43.542
SHE'S WORKED WITH US FOR AGES,
WHICH IS WHY IT'S--

23:43.583 --> 23:48.125
SUSAN HAS BEEN WITH ME
FOR 20 YEARS.

23:51.125 --> 23:54.041
SO, UH...

23:54.083 --> 23:56.917
SHOPPING AND THEN LUNCH?

23:56.959 --> 23:59.083
MOTHER...

23:59.125 --> 24:01.417
SIT DOWN.

24:12.875 --> 24:15.041
(sighs)

24:15.083 --> 24:17.709
THERE WAS ONE GIRL
IN BOARDING SCHOOL

24:17.750 --> 24:19.500
WHEN I WAS 14.

24:19.542 --> 24:22.500
AND THEN THERE WAS THE ONE
IN SWITZERLAND ON HOLIDAY

24:22.542 --> 24:25.041
WHEN I WAS 17,
BUT THOSE DON'T COUNT.

24:25.083 --> 24:28.583
IT WAS COLD,
AND WE WERE GIRLS.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.542
BUT...

24:30.583 --> 24:34.333
THEN I MET SUSAN.

24:34.375 --> 24:35.959
AND THE CAPTAIN?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
DOES HE KNOW?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.125
WE DON'T DISCUSS IT,

24:40.166 --> 24:42.041
BUT, YES, HE KNOWS.

24:42.083 --> 24:45.000
I THINK HE'S ALWAYS KNOWN.

24:49.208 --> 24:52.000
DID YOU EVER LOVE HIM?

24:53.625 --> 24:57.542
(laughs) OH, MY... BIZZY,
WHY DID YOU MARRY HIM?

24:57.583 --> 25:00.041
WE'RE FROM CONNECTICUT.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.583
(exhales)
MY FATHER
IS A BRADFORD FORBES.

25:02.625 --> 25:05.750
OKAY, SO...
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

25:05.792 --> 25:08.500
YOU WERE THE CHEATING WHORE,
NOT DAD?

25:08.542 --> 25:10.041
I'M GONNA GO.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.041
IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK LIKE THAT,
I'LL GO.

25:12.083 --> 25:14.959
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.917
OH, COME ON, BIZZY.
HOW HARD COULD IT HAVE BEEN?

25:17.959 --> 25:19.917
I MEAN,
NOTHING WAS EXPECTED OF YOU.

25:19.959 --> 25:21.917
ALL YOU HAD TO WAS
ORDER THE HOUSEKEEPER AROUND,

25:21.959 --> 25:23.333
RUN YOUR CHARITIES

25:23.375 --> 25:26.041
AND SCREW YOUR HUSBAND
EVERY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

25:26.083 --> 25:29.041
HOW COMPLICATED IS THAT?

25:29.083 --> 25:30.625
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.750
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.041
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.667
YOU DON'T KNOW
ONE SINGLE THING ABOUT ME.

25:37.709 --> 25:39.667
I COULD HAVE DONE THINGS.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.041
I COULD HAVE... BEEN THINGS.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.875
BUT I'M A FORBES.

25:44.917 --> 25:48.041
SO I GOT MARRIED BECAUSE THAT
WAS WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

25:48.083 --> 25:51.041
AND I CHOSE YOUR FATHER
BECAUSE HE ASKED

25:51.083 --> 25:53.041
AND HE WAS NICE

25:53.083 --> 25:56.458
AND HE SEEMED LIKE
HE WOULDN'T SUFFOCATE ME.

25:56.500 --> 26:01.041
AND BY THE TIME I REALIZED
MY MISTAKE, I HAD CHILDREN.

26:01.083 --> 26:03.792
SO I MADE A LIFE.

26:03.834 --> 26:06.667
I DID WHAT I COULD
WITH WHAT I HAD.

26:06.709 --> 26:09.667
AND I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
IN LOVE WITH YOUR FATHER,

26:09.709 --> 26:11.041
BUT I LOVED HIM.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.250
I DO LOVE HIM.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.250
AND I LOVED YOU
AND YOUR BROTHER.

26:15.291 --> 26:18.041
AND SO INSTEAD OF DOING
WHAT I WANTED TO,

26:18.083 --> 26:22.041
WHICH WAS RUN
OR SLIT MY WRISTS,

26:22.083 --> 26:25.250
I THREW BIRTHDAY PARTIES
AND I SMILED

26:25.291 --> 26:27.500
AND I KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.542
AND I RAISED YOU
AND YOUR BROTHER,

26:29.583 --> 26:32.041
AND YOU BOTH
TURNED OUT BRILLIANTLY.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.500
SUSAN WAS FOR ME.

26:33.542 --> 26:36.500
SUSAN WAS THE ONE THING
THAT WAS FOR ME.

26:36.542 --> 26:39.041
MY CHILDREN
TOOK EVERYTHING ELSE.

26:39.083 --> 26:42.834
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE A CHILD,

26:42.875 --> 26:46.083
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A MOTHER.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

26:48.083 --> 26:51.875
THE SACRIFICES A WOMAN MAKES
WHEN SHE HAS CHILDREN.

26:51.917 --> 26:56.709
SO DON'T YOU DARE JUDGE ME.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.500
(cries)

27:03.917 --> 27:06.000
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

27:06.041 --> 27:09.709
NAOMI HAD TO CALL ME
TO CALM DELL DOWN.
HE CAN DECIDE
WHATEVER HE WANTS FOR HIMSELF,

27:09.750 --> 27:14.041
BUT THAT LITTLE GIRL
WANTS HER MOTHER.
THAT IS NOT YOURS TO SAY.
YOU MADE IT WORSE AND--

27:14.083 --> 27:16.333
DON'T YOU DARE LECTURE ME
ABOUT MAKING THINGS WORSE.

27:16.375 --> 27:19.500
YOU DON'T GET TO LECTURE ME.
(Naomi) DELL... STOP!

27:19.542 --> 27:21.750
DELL!

27:21.792 --> 27:23.917
YOU WANT TO HIT ME? FINE.
GET OFF!

27:23.959 --> 27:25.917
BUT THERE'S A WOMAN IN THERE
WHO YOU LOVED,

27:25.959 --> 27:27.917
THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD,
HER CHILD,

27:27.959 --> 27:29.917
WHO DESPERATELY
WANTS TO SEE HER.

27:29.959 --> 27:32.291
YEAH, YOU'RE PISSED.
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE PISSED.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.291
BUT IF YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE
WITH THIS, DELL,

27:34.333 --> 27:36.333
IF YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE
WITH IT NOW,

27:36.375 --> 27:39.792
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET ANOTHER
CHANCE, AND IT WILL EAT AT YOU.
GET OFF!

27:39.834 --> 27:42.792
DELL, LET BETSEY SEE
HER MOTHER BEFORE SHE DIES.
STAY AWAY FROM ME!

27:42.834 --> 27:45.750
JUST STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY!

27:47.959 --> 27:50.917
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
THIS ISN'T PERSONAL?
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU CAN CONDONE

27:50.959 --> 27:52.917
KEEPING A CHILD
AWAY FROM THEIR MOTHER,

27:52.959 --> 27:55.000
MAYBE THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU.
NOT TO ME.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.375
HEATHER MADE A MISTAKE,

27:56.417 --> 27:59.000
BUT IF THAT CHILD
DOESN'T GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

27:59.041 --> 28:01.667
YOU TELL ME WHAT IT DOES
TO THAT KID.

28:31.792 --> 28:34.000
DRINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.333
(exhales deeply)

28:39.375 --> 28:41.625
SHE'S VERY UPSET.

28:41.667 --> 28:44.667
IS SHE? I'M SORRY.
THAT'S SO SAD.

28:44.709 --> 28:46.750
DRINK SOME MORE.

28:48.417 --> 28:50.875
JUST GIVE ME
ONE GOOD REASON

28:50.917 --> 28:54.041
WHY MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD
WAS A LIE--ONE GOOD REASON.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.667
WE WERE TRYING TO PROTECT
YOU AND ARCHER.

28:56.709 --> 28:59.041
REALLY? BECAUSE I'M A CHEATER,
ARCHER'S A CHEATER.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.125
WE'RE ALL
THESE AWESOME CHEATERS.

29:01.166 --> 29:04.041
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A BUNCH
OF CRAP--PROTECTING US.

29:04.083 --> 29:06.583
I WANT A GOOD REASON.

29:06.625 --> 29:10.000
SHE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.417
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 40 YEARS--

29:12.458 --> 29:14.875
40 YEARS.

29:14.917 --> 29:18.875
MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE,
SHE HAS BEEN AT MY SIDE.

29:18.917 --> 29:21.208
I LOVE HER.
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

29:21.250 --> 29:25.875
SHE'S MY... EVERYTHING.

29:25.917 --> 29:29.041
IT'S NOT HER FAULT,
YOU KNOW? SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.750
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

29:31.792 --> 29:34.709
AND WHEN WE DID...

29:34.750 --> 29:37.291
SHE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

29:37.333 --> 29:41.875
LOVE IS COMPLICATED.

29:41.917 --> 29:44.625
BEING A LESBIAN
IS NOT A CHOICE.

29:44.667 --> 29:46.959
SHE'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE
HER MIND.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.041
HELL, SHE'S PRACTICALLY SCREWING
SUSAN RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.542
THE MOUTH ON YOU...

29:51.583 --> 29:54.375
YOU KNOW... (chuckles)
SHE SLEEPS WITH ONE WOMAN.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.458
I SLEEP WITH ALL THE REST.
SO WHAT?!

29:56.500 --> 29:58.458
AND THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

29:58.500 --> 30:00.041
MY ENTIRE LIFE,

30:00.083 --> 30:03.000
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
THIS POOR, PATHETIC WOMAN.

30:03.041 --> 30:05.959
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY JOB
TO COVER FOR YOU.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.959
AND IT MADE ME HATE YOU.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.333
I MEAN,
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

30:09.375 --> 30:11.125
I HATED THE WRONG PARENT.

30:11.166 --> 30:14.041
I--MY CHEATING? I THOUGHT
I GOT IT FROM YOU.

30:14.083 --> 30:17.041
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
THE POOR, PATHETIC ONE,

30:17.083 --> 30:20.041
BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER,
AND SHE LOVES SOMEONE ELSE.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.667
BUT YOU STAY.

30:21.709 --> 30:25.041
THIS IS LIKE SOME PATHETIC,
SAD, AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL,

30:25.083 --> 30:26.834
WHICH IS JUST AWFUL,

30:26.875 --> 30:29.291
BECAUSE NOW--
NOW I HATE YOU BOTH.

THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.792
NO, IT'S ABOUT THEM.

33:18.834 --> 33:20.917
IT'S THEIR FAMILY.

33:20.959 --> 33:24.083
I'M SURE YOU CARE ABOUT ADDISON,
BUT SO DO I, SO DO THEY.

33:24.125 --> 33:27.542
THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA RUN OUT
BECAUSE ADDISON IS--IS UPSET.

33:27.583 --> 33:31.166
AND I WILL NOT LET...
THIS DESTROY THEM.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.000
WELL, SHE'S MY FAMILY, TOO.

33:33.041 --> 33:35.542
AND I THINK I KNOW HER
BETTER RIGHT NOW.

33:35.583 --> 33:38.166
SO I'M NOT ASKING. I'M TELLING
YOU, YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

33:38.208 --> 33:40.583
NOW IF ADDISON WANTS TO
MAKE THINGS RIGHT,

33:40.625 --> 33:43.041
THEN THAT'S UP TO HER.

33:43.083 --> 33:45.208
BUT YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO PUSH HER.
SAM--

33:45.250 --> 33:46.834

33:49.875 --> 33:51.625
IF YOU CARE ABOUT ADDISON,

33:51.667 --> 33:54.417
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU DO,

33:54.458 --> 33:57.000
LEAVE.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.041
COME BACK TO BED, COOP.

34:00.083 --> 34:02.041
I GOTTA GET BACK

34:02.083 --> 34:04.125
YOU SHOULDN'T BE EMBARRASSED.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.417
THINGS HAVE BEEN
REALLY STRESSFUL LATELY.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.041
DELL'S FAMILY--

34:08.083 --> 34:11.125
OH, IS IT TIME
FOR THE SEXOLOGY ADVICE?

34:11.166 --> 34:14.125
"IMPOTENCE HAPPENS TO ALL MEN.
IT'S USUALLY JUST STRESS.

34:14.166 --> 34:17.166
MAYBE WE CAN CUDDLE INSTEAD."
COOPER...

34:17.208 --> 34:19.792
YOU NEGLECTED TO TELL ME
THAT YOU WERE MARRIED BEFORE.

34:19.834 --> 34:22.041
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
COOPER--

34:22.083 --> 34:24.083
OH, SHUT UP, OKAY?

34:24.125 --> 34:26.250
SHUT UP.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.500
I HATE YOU!

34:42.542 --> 34:44.500
SHE'S JUST UPSET RIGHT NOW.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.500
WELL, I'M UPSET, TOO, OKAY?
SHE HATES ME.

34:46.542 --> 34:50.041
I'M--I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
ALMOST KILLED HER, YOU KNOW.

34:50.083 --> 34:52.834
I'M TIRED, VIOLET.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

34:52.875 --> 34:55.208
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.
AND YOU ARE PROTECTING HER.
I KNOW THAT.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.959
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER FROM
SEEING SOMETHING HORRIBLE.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.208
BUT MAYBE YOU'RE PROTECTING HER
FROM THE WRONG THINGS, DELL.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.083
I MEAN, MY LIFE IS A MESS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

35:04.125 --> 35:06.083
AND--AND YOU'RE--
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.291
I DON'T ALWAYS MAKE
THE BEST CHOICES.

35:08.333 --> 35:12.542
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, I'VE
ALWAYS MADE THEM WITH, UH...

35:15.583 --> 35:17.041
WITH LUCAS...

35:17.083 --> 35:20.083
WITH LUCAS IN MIND,
TO PROTECT HIM.

35:20.125 --> 35:23.083
AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M RIGHT,
BUT MAYBE...

35:23.125 --> 35:26.333
I-I JUST KNOW THAT IF HEATHER
COULD, SHE WOULD TAKE AWAY

35:26.375 --> 35:29.041
ALL THE HURT THAT SHE HAS
CAUSED YOU AND BETSEY,

35:29.083 --> 35:32.041
EVERY LAST BIT OF IT, DELL.

35:32.083 --> 35:34.041
(lowered voice)
I FOUND A PIPE LAST NIGHT--

35:34.083 --> 35:37.375
LAST NIGHT--
AND I CONFRONTED HER ABOUT IT.

35:37.417 --> 35:40.375
AND SHE SAID IT WASN'T HERS,
THAT SHE HAD A FRIEND OVER.

35:40.417 --> 35:42.375
YOU KNOW,
AND I KNEW SHE WAS LYING.

35:42.417 --> 35:44.375
I MEAN,
I KNEW SHE WAS LYING.

35:44.417 --> 35:46.041
BUT I WANTED AND I NEEDED

35:46.083 --> 35:48.333

35:48.375 --> 35:50.750
THAT SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT
TO ME OR TO BETSEY,

35:50.792 --> 35:53.125
THAT SHE LOVED US ENOUGH
TO STAY CLEAN.

35:53.166 --> 35:57.500
SO I WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE,
AND I LEFT MY DAUGHTER.

35:57.542 --> 36:01.041
I LEFT BETSEY.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.959
AND SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
SO SCARED WHEN IT HAPPENED.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.417
I DID THAT TO HER--ME.
