Morning, Madam President. It's 5:00 A.M.

- And Nevada is still asleep.
- <i> Hello? What?</i>

00:21.781 --> 00:24.582
Well, wake it the fuck up 'cause
I'm wondering if we should remove

00:24.667 --> 00:26.701
the Native American precincts
from the recount list.

00:26.786 --> 00:28.786
I'm having reservations
about the reservations.

00:28.872 --> 00:31.506
So figure that out and call me
right back. I'm at Walter Reed.

00:31.624 --> 00:35.093

- This is not optimal.

Where I'm from a vote is a

- and the count is the count.
- He makes a lot of sense.

02:24.737 --> 02:28.122
All right, so they've got a Secretary
of State and what do I have?

02:28.241 --> 02:29.740
Harpo, Chico, and Shito.

02:29.876 --> 02:31.409
- You know who we need?
- Who? Who do we need?

02:31.544 --> 02:32.793
Bob Bradley, my old mentor.

02:32.912 --> 02:34.545
- The Eagle.
- That'd be amazing.

Bob Bradley.

Let's talk ground rules.
According to Nevada law,

04:22.071 --> 04:25.489
<i>if the recount sample shows
a difference of 1% or more,</i>

04:25.575 --> 04:29.160
which in this case comes to 512 votes,

04:29.245 --> 04:30.745
we go ahead and recount the whole state.

04:30.863 --> 04:33.114
Now, most of the voting
here is touch screen,

04:33.199 --> 04:35.283
so we can't do more than
retabulate those totals.

04:35.368 --> 04:39.036
Except you could recount the
voter-verified paper audit trails.

04:39.172 --> 04:40.621
Sometimes there are big discrepancies.

04:40.707 --> 04:42.623
- Sir, in that case we motion...
- On the other hand,

04:42.709 --> 04:45.459
the ninth circuit court of appeals
ruled in Crowley v. Nevada

04:45.545 --> 04:48.462
that you don't have to recount the
paper audit trails in local elections.

04:48.548 --> 04:50.765
- That's Crawley versus Nevada?
- That's Crowley.

04:50.883 --> 04:52.350
Actually, you know what?
I could email you.

04:52.435 --> 04:55.553
Or you could email me at
splett2@splettnet.net.

04:55.638 --> 04:57.638
Splett1 is my father. It'll
be sad to see him go,

04:57.724 --> 04:59.890

All right, let's hear it,
Affirmative Action Jackson.

06:02.872 --> 06:06.457
Well, the county clerk of Nye County
disqualified a huge number of mail-in ballots

06:06.542 --> 06:08.342
because the signatures didn't
match the voter rolls,

06:08.461 --> 06:11.212

an O'Brien fundraiser.</i>

- but neither one of them are crystal.
- Oh, darn it.

06:31.484 --> 06:34.034
This reminds me of something
that Dick Nixon used to say

06:34.153 --> 06:36.487
to Henry Kissinger back when
that tricky son of a bitch

06:36.622 --> 06:39.623
was trying to get us out of that
messy business called Vietnam.

06:39.709 --> 06:40.530
Vietnam, right.

06:40.555 --> 06:43.017
He would say, "Henry,
you son of a bitch.

06:43.129 --> 06:45.746
I can lead a horse to water,
but I can't milk it."

06:45.832 --> 06:47.581

06:47.667 --> 06:50.167
Can't milk it! I don't
even know what that means.

- I've got to make a million phone calls.

07:07.603 --> 07:10.321

nicknames for this guy.

07:10.406 --> 07:12.523
We called him Fatty Dicksuckle

07:12.658 --> 07:14.825

remembered my nickname.

- My, oh, my.
- KENT: Still here?

07:29.208 --> 07:32.176
He hasn't worked in the White
House since the late '80s.

07:32.261 --> 07:34.712
- How old is Sue?
- Huh?

07:34.847 --> 07:37.097
AMY: <i>Well, that's clearly
a vote for Meyer.</i>

07:37.216 --> 07:39.216

It's a write-in.

07:39.352 --> 07:40.935
It says "Fuck Selina Meyer."

07:41.053 --> 07:42.803
If anything, that one
should count for us.

07:42.889 --> 07:44.138
Move to call this a no vote.

07:44.223 --> 07:46.390
No, no, no. See, right there.

07:46.526 --> 07:48.442
See that? Yeah, that's a comma.

07:48.561 --> 07:50.361
- Where?
- After fuck, that is a comma.

07:50.446 --> 07:51.779
So it doesn't say "Fuck Selina Meyer."

07:51.898 --> 07:53.981
It says, you know, "Fuck, Selina Meyer!"

07:54.066 --> 07:56.867
That's a testament to
this voter's earthy

08:52.508 --> 08:54.091
Except I'm not the man with no name.

08:54.176 --> 08:55.593
I'm the man with mo' game.

08:55.678 --> 08:57.461
(KNOCKS)

08:57.597 --> 09:01.181
Afternoon, sir. We're
here because your ballot

09:01.300 --> 09:03.183
was disqualified because your
signature didn't match...

09:03.302 --> 09:04.935
okay, well, fooled me with that one.
(LAUGHS)

09:05.021 --> 09:07.638
- Good job, team.
- Yeah, nice job, Richard.

09:07.773 --> 09:09.640
That's not how I would've
done it if I was in charge.

09:09.775 --> 09:11.358
How would you have done it?

09:11.477 --> 09:13.310
I can't teach how I do it.

09:13.396 --> 09:16.730
Can Paul McCartney teach Kid Rock
how to be a good songwriter?

09:16.816 --> 09:19.450
I mean, that's a bad example.
Kid Rock rules, but...

09:21.654 --> 09:24.788
GARY: <i> Hey, ma'am, this is Charlie
Baird, CEO of EM Wheelright.</i>

09:24.874 --> 09:26.457
- Hello, Madam President.
- You're Charlie Baird.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.158
- I am. Good to see you.
- Yes, good to see you, too.

09:28.244 --> 09:29.543
- Thanks for coming today.
- My pleasure.

09:29.662 --> 09:31.211
I thought this was going to be two hours

09:31.330 --> 09:33.330
of Tom James lecturing us
about being paid too much.

09:33.466 --> 09:36.584
(LAUGHS) Well, Tom can be, dare I say...

09:36.669 --> 09:38.636
A bit of an asshat?

09:38.721 --> 09:41.305
Actually, I was gonna say a
champion for the middle class,

09:41.390 --> 09:44.475
but I kind of like your thing
better to tell you the truth.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.226
Ma'am, this is Phillip Ryan. He's the...

09:46.345 --> 09:48.345
- Can you hang on just two seconds?
- Of course.

09:48.431 --> 09:51.649
So let me ask you this. What in the
heck is going on with the markets?

09:51.734 --> 09:53.350
- I don't know.
- Oh, great.

09:53.436 --> 09:54.935
I do know that yesterday morning

09:55.021 --> 09:57.855
this room felt about
$25 billion smarter.

09:57.940 --> 10:01.659
Yeah, I think that's what all of
you donated to my opponent, right?

10:01.744 --> 10:04.111
Full disclosure, I did donate
to your campaign as well.

10:04.196 --> 10:05.863
Mm-hmm. Two grand?

10:05.998 --> 10:08.115
Where'd you find that? In
your sofa seat cushion?

10:08.200 --> 10:10.417
I think it was in my other
pants, Madam President.

10:10.536 --> 10:12.586
- (LAUGHS) Good. Nice to have you here.
- Hey, ma'am.

10:12.705 --> 10:14.643
This is Eli Park. He's
the CEO of CM Capital.

10:14.668 --> 10:15.313
Oh, yes.

10:15.374 --> 10:17.875
- Oh, hello, Eli.
- Madam President.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.844
- Yes, how is Susan?
- He's divorced.

10:20.930 --> 10:24.131
Not in jail for what she did to you.

10:24.216 --> 10:26.684
Honestly, it is an outrage.
But I'm happy you're here.

10:26.769 --> 10:28.852
And I think we've got to get
this meeting going, don't we?

10:28.938 --> 10:30.521
It's got to get... yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:30.606 --> 10:32.272
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Madam President.

10:32.391 --> 10:35.726
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

10:35.811 --> 10:37.478
Don't worry about Eli.

10:37.563 --> 10:39.647
Brooks Brothers sews prenups
into all our suits.

10:39.732 --> 10:42.149
- Oh, are you divorced?
- Oh, yeah, proudly.

10:42.234 --> 10:43.901
Yeah, best thing me and
my husband ever did.

10:44.036 --> 10:46.487
- Including our daughter.
- (LAUGHS)

10:46.572 --> 10:49.573
Listen, I heard you on Bloomberg

10:49.659 --> 10:51.825
talking about my financial acumen,

10:51.911 --> 10:55.462
and I have to say you
were wildly out of line.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.748
- Well, most of that is just for show.
- Uh-huh.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.250
But, with all due
respect, Madam President,

11:00.386 --> 11:02.252
some of your economic policies

11:02.388 --> 11:05.839
are what my friend Katie
Gross likes to call fakakta.

11:05.925 --> 11:07.641
Katie Gross? You know Katie Gross?

11:07.760 --> 11:09.093
I went to Smith with Katie Gross.

11:09.178 --> 11:11.145
- I dated Katie Gross.
- Yeah, so did I.

11:11.263 --> 11:13.230
'Cause I was at Smith.
No, it's a Smith joke.

11:13.315 --> 11:15.315
- That's incredible.
- This is Elizabeth Moorehouse.

11:15.434 --> 11:17.484
- Oh, hi, how are you?
- I'm well, thank you.

11:17.603 --> 11:20.354
- Thank you for coming today.
- My pleasure, Madam President.

11:20.439 --> 11:22.356
I hope you can talk some
sense into the fed.

11:22.441 --> 11:24.108
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

11:24.243 --> 11:27.828
Madam President, Katie says
to tell you Hubbard forever.

11:27.947 --> 11:29.113
- She didn't.
- She did.

11:29.248 --> 11:30.497
She didn't! That's hilar...

11:30.616 --> 11:33.250
that was our dorm and it was repulsive.

11:33.335 --> 11:35.536
- You know Katie Gross?
- It sounds familiar.

11:35.621 --> 11:37.121
I bet your paths have crossed.

11:37.206 --> 11:40.791
The second signature was
when Carl had his stroke.

11:40.926 --> 11:43.544
Oh, that's fantastic. I
mean, fantastic for us

11:43.629 --> 11:46.463
because it means that his vote for
President Meyer is legitimate.

11:46.599 --> 11:49.633
- Could he testify to that?
- I'm sorry, he's passed.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.052
Sorry. You should read C.S.
Lewis's book on grief.

11:52.138 --> 11:54.138
It's not as fun as "The Lion,
Witch, and the Wardrobe" series,

11:54.223 --> 11:56.140
- but it's still pretty good.
- Ma'am, hi.

11:56.275 --> 11:59.226
Jonah Ryan, Senior Deputy Recount
Strategist for the Meyer campaign.

11:59.311 --> 12:02.146
Would it be all right if we
waited for your husband inside?

12:02.281 --> 12:04.648
- I think I have a small blister.
- I'm sorry.

12:04.784 --> 12:07.367
Alav hashalom. Hebrew.

12:07.486 --> 12:11.038
Maybe you should put on your
regular shoes for a little bit?

12:11.157 --> 12:14.374
You know what? I am sick of
your micromanaging bullshit.

12:14.493 --> 12:17.578
But if you insist, yes, I
will stop by the hotel.

12:17.663 --> 12:20.631
We can do that. It's a two-minute walk.

12:20.716 --> 12:23.167
Oh, sorry, two miles. Ha, so...

12:23.252 --> 12:24.218
God.

12:26.088 --> 12:28.672
Well, well, well, if it
isn't TV's Ellen DeGeneres

12:28.758 --> 12:30.841
and of course Amy Brookheimer.

12:30.976 --> 12:32.760
Congressman Furlong, to what do we owe

12:32.845 --> 12:34.928
this pleasure slash
skin-crawling sensation?

12:35.014 --> 12:38.265
Well, I just came out West to
play a little Cowboys and Injuns

12:38.350 --> 12:40.400
with Big Chief Suckum Choad here.

12:40.519 --> 12:42.236
Say it.

12:42.354 --> 12:44.021
(CLEARS THROAT) How.

12:44.156 --> 12:46.690
Me suck pee pee in teepee.

12:46.776 --> 12:49.493
(LAUGHS) Atta girl.

12:49.578 --> 12:51.361
Actually, Bob Bradley
asked me to come out here

12:51.497 --> 12:55.032
and dazzle some of these armadillo
fuckers with my political star power.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.417
Step aside, roadkill.
Big rig coming through.

12:57.536 --> 12:58.836
Hi, Amy, Dan.

12:58.921 --> 13:00.254
- <i> Hi again.</i>
- How you doing?

13:00.372 --> 13:01.922
That is not an overvote.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.508
The voter crossed out O'Brien's
name and voted for Meyer.

13:04.593 --> 13:05.959
That is a vote for Meyer.

13:06.045 --> 13:07.878
Move to rule it an overvote.

13:08.013 --> 13:10.347
Hey, Grimace. What are you...

13:10.432 --> 13:12.266
no, no, no, not you.

13:12.384 --> 13:15.018
The other person in the room who
looks exactly like Grimace.

13:15.104 --> 13:17.437
That is not an overvote. You
need to trust me on this

13:17.556 --> 13:19.223
because I've been doing this
since before your mother

13:19.358 --> 13:21.391
was throwing herself down
the stairs belly first.

13:21.527 --> 13:22.810
You want me to get you some glasses?

13:22.895 --> 13:24.695
Maybe I'll call in Mayor McCheese?

13:24.780 --> 13:27.481
He can come in here and explain
election procedures to you.

13:27.566 --> 13:29.783
- (WHIMPERING)
- Oh, I'm not...

13:29.902 --> 13:31.985
- Tracy.
- Look, it's... you're wearing purple.

13:32.071 --> 13:34.371
All right? It's got nothing
to do with your body shape

13:34.456 --> 13:37.908
or your... the way your head goes
into your shoulders so smoothly.

13:38.043 --> 13:40.744
Hey, you know, we have to get
to your next meeting at the...

13:40.880 --> 13:42.713
That's right. Good call. God bless you.

13:42.798 --> 13:45.082
God bless America.

13:45.217 --> 13:49.386
When you're ready, we would like
to vigorously contest your ruling.

13:49.471 --> 13:52.222
Oh, ma'am, I have photos to approve
from the banking task force.

13:52.308 --> 13:55.392
And you have a meeting with
Olympic medalists in five.

13:55.477 --> 13:56.216
Special or normal?

13:56.241 --> 13:58.252
Well, they seemed
normal, but I'll confirm.

13:58.314 --> 13:59.763
Okay.

13:59.849 --> 14:03.317
So you catch "The Godfather"
on TV last night?

14:03.435 --> 14:04.219
No.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.594
There was nothing like
seeing it in the theater

14:06.655 --> 14:10.274
when it first came out back in '72.

14:10.409 --> 14:12.442
I don't care for movies.

14:14.780 --> 14:18.615
You've truly brought honor to
America with your kayaking.

14:18.751 --> 14:21.618
So congratulations on your gold medal.

14:21.704 --> 14:24.705
- It's bronze.
- Oh. Oh, bronze medal.

14:24.790 --> 14:26.673
Did we get it? Oh, and
thank you for this.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.959
I can't wait to try it out
on the Potomac. (LAUGHS)

14:29.044 --> 14:30.594
- All right, guys. Right this way.
- SELINA: Okay.

14:30.679 --> 14:32.429
Great. Great. Great. Great. Okay.

14:32.514 --> 14:34.131
Fuck am I supposed to do with this?

14:34.266 --> 14:36.850
- It'd be nice for your library.
- What?

14:36.969 --> 14:38.802
Catherine, out.

14:38.938 --> 14:42.022
So what's the press saying
about our banking task force?

14:42.141 --> 14:44.141
They opened wide and
slurped it down, ma'am.

14:44.276 --> 14:46.109
You know what I was thinking?

14:46.195 --> 14:49.313
I was thinking that I would like
to do another banking task force.

14:49.448 --> 14:51.164
I bet we could get
Pallenberg at Barclays.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.306
I see no problem there.

14:52.368 --> 14:55.152
No, you know who had a lot to say
was that guy from Wheelright.

14:55.237 --> 14:58.071
Charlie... Baird.

14:58.157 --> 14:59.957
- Really?
- <i> Uh-huh.</i>

15:00.042 --> 15:03.043
Ma'am, I don't think right now

15:03.162 --> 15:05.996
would be the best time for
another banking task force.

15:06.081 --> 15:08.715
No, I just want to have a
quick banking task force.

15:08.834 --> 15:12.386
With all due respect, ma'am, you
know, the banks will still be,

15:12.504 --> 15:15.222
you know, raring to go for a task force,

15:15.341 --> 15:18.475
you know, when you're safely reelected.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.094
I'm human, okay? I just...

15:21.180 --> 15:25.816
I just sometimes need a
little banking task force.

15:25.901 --> 15:29.686
Well, ma'am, if you want, I can arrange
a more discreet banking task force.

15:29.822 --> 15:31.855
I don't want that kind
of banking task force.

15:31.991 --> 15:33.824
I want the banking task
force that I want.

15:33.909 --> 15:35.826
What about Patty Driscoll
from Deutsche Bank?

15:35.911 --> 15:38.278
She's very good. Might be nice
to throw a woman in the mix.

15:38.364 --> 15:40.364
Ma'am, Amy's on video conference.

15:40.449 --> 15:42.699
SELINA: <i>Amy, what is it?</i>

15:42.835 --> 15:45.535
- Can you see me? I can't see you.
- Yeah.

15:45.621 --> 15:47.955
-<i> Am I on your screen?</i>
- Who cares if you can't see me?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.374
We're not looking at each other's
hairdos. What's going on in Nevada?

15:50.459 --> 15:52.376
- Kent, are you sitting on a bottle?
- Shh, shh!

15:52.511 --> 15:54.127
- Ma'am, where are you?
- Amy?

15:54.213 --> 15:57.014
Ah, there you are. Precinct
totals have been reported.

15:57.099 --> 15:59.216
We got... votes.

15:59.351 --> 16:01.385
Wait, you just went out.
What did you just say?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.136
We got... votes.

16:03.222 --> 16:05.806
- How many votes did we get?
- Let me try a landline.

16:05.891 --> 16:08.392
- I'm losing my mind.
- We got it. We got it.

16:08.527 --> 16:11.395
512 votes. Full state recount is a go.

16:11.530 --> 16:14.231
- (LAUGHING)
- Fucking recount!

16:14.366 --> 16:17.200
- Oh, my God!
- This is favorable news.

16:17.286 --> 16:20.737
Oh, my God, this is my house.
This is my house.

16:20.873 --> 16:24.741
Hey, guys, listen up. Okay, precinct
totals have been reported and...

16:24.827 --> 16:27.377
Oh, just hang up on her.
Wait, where is Catherine?

16:27.463 --> 16:29.413
She should be getting this
for her little movie.

16:29.498 --> 16:32.249
I'm feeling light-headed. That bottle's
my only source of blood sugar.

16:32.384 --> 16:34.751
Okay, Gary, I'm wanna get Charlie
Baird in for another meeting.

16:34.837 --> 16:36.219
You want me to invite some other people?

16:36.305 --> 16:37.971
- No, no, no, just him.
- Oh.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.222
- Just him?
- Yep.

16:39.308 --> 16:40.757
Here's your stupid bottle.

16:40.893 --> 16:43.560
Stop with the Kabuki show
and eat a fucking cookie.

16:43.645 --> 16:47.814
Uh, Mike, remind me again
the science behind this.

16:52.321 --> 16:54.604
MIKE: <i>Now I feel great.</i>

16:54.690 --> 16:57.491
You guys have got to try this.

16:57.609 --> 16:59.609
We need surrogates for
the Sunday talk shows.

16:59.695 --> 17:01.611
- Right.
- Chung will do it.

17:01.747 --> 17:04.531
Chung would volunteer for a beheading
video to get national airtime.

17:04.616 --> 17:06.366
I'd actually like to see that.

17:06.452 --> 17:08.785
Ma'am, Tom James is
here sans appointment.

17:08.871 --> 17:12.622
Bleh. Can you go tell him to fuck
a bag of glass or something?

17:12.708 --> 17:15.291
Actually, I told him something similar
to that, but he's most insistent.

17:15.426 --> 17:17.627
Oh, okay. Send him in.

17:17.713 --> 17:20.513
Hi there. This is an
unexpected pleasure.

17:20.632 --> 17:23.934
No, no, no, guys. I
want you to hear this.

17:24.019 --> 17:26.970
Ma'am, on reflection,
I totally understand

17:27.106 --> 17:29.689
why you needed to take the lead
on the banking task force.

17:29.808 --> 17:33.560
And I am ready to do whatever I
need to do to help the team.

17:33.645 --> 17:38.365
So, economy czar, kids' birthday
parties, reflecting pool boy.

17:38.484 --> 17:41.034
Just don't ask me to be the
United Nations ambassador

17:41.153 --> 17:42.736
'cause I still have some pride.

17:42.821 --> 17:45.038
(LAUGHS)

17:45.157 --> 17:47.457
I wanted to say that and
I'll leave you guys alone.

17:47.543 --> 17:50.577
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, great. Thanks. Good to see you.

17:50.662 --> 17:53.630
Oh, by the way, I just polished
the floor in the Eisenhower Room.

17:53.715 --> 17:56.133
- Tom, stop.
-<i> Be careful in there, all right?</i>

17:56.218 --> 17:58.218
- Huh?
- That was something.

17:58.337 --> 18:01.972
Why did Tom James just wrap up his balls
in butcher paper and put them in my purse?

18:02.057 --> 18:04.841
Because he thinks you're
gonna win Nevada.

18:04.977 --> 18:06.843
- Tom thinks I'm gonna win Nevada?
- Yeah.

18:06.979 --> 18:09.179
- "Nev-add-a."
- He's the smartest guy in DC.

18:09.314 --> 18:11.431
You know that? He's a lot
smarter than you dummies.

18:11.517 --> 18:15.185
Seriously, if Tom thinks I'm
gonna win Nevada, I'm gonna win.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.603

18:16.688 --> 18:17.904
Ma'am, Charlie Baird is here.

18:18.023 --> 18:20.023
Oh.

18:20.109 --> 18:21.525
Hey, I'm gonna be president,

18:21.660 --> 18:24.528
so I can go take a shit in the
Rose Garden if I want to.

18:24.663 --> 18:26.947
We used to call that a Jimmy Carter.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.583
Charlie Baird. Move.

18:29.701 --> 18:31.952
<i>Madam President. What a lovely surprise.</i>

18:32.037 --> 18:33.370
Oh, thank you.

18:33.455 --> 18:35.589
I thought my $2,000 donation
only entitled me to a photo.

18:35.707 --> 18:38.375
- How are you?
- I am good. I am energized.

18:38.460 --> 18:42.179
So, you know, you made an interesting point
earlier today about the bond market...

18:42.264 --> 18:44.264
but you know what? Before we do that,

18:44.383 --> 18:47.100
would you like to go on a tour of
the West Wing? Would that be fun?

18:47.219 --> 18:48.898
I don't know if you have
time for that, ma'am.

18:48.923 --> 18:49.743
Yeah, I have time.

18:49.855 --> 18:52.022
- Okay.
- Yeah? Okay.

18:52.107 --> 18:54.558
I warn you, I had a pretty comprehensive White
House tour on my fifth grade class trip.

18:54.643 --> 18:58.645
I actually know a lot about West
Wing history if you'd like... no.

18:58.730 --> 19:00.730
I feel like that guy
doesn't like me very much.

19:00.816 --> 19:02.532
- Who, Gary?
- Yeah.

19:02.618 --> 19:04.534
Come on, that's like saying
that the cat doesn't like you

19:04.620 --> 19:06.069
or that table doesn't like you.

19:06.155 --> 19:08.071
Okay, now, there's this
Rockwell down here

19:08.207 --> 19:11.658
that is so stunning and I swear to
God if I lose this fucking election,

19:11.743 --> 19:14.244
I'm gonna stick it in my suitcase
and I'm taking it with me.

19:14.329 --> 19:15.579
- Love Rockwell.
- Yeah.

19:15.664 --> 19:17.914
- I have a bunch of Rockwells.
- You do?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.416
- Yeah.
- You're kidding.

19:19.551 --> 19:21.301
- No.
- Where are they?

19:21.420 --> 19:23.837
Some beach house.

19:23.922 --> 19:26.640
- Not sure which beach.
- You are wild.

19:26.758 --> 19:28.391
In another person it would be bragging,

19:28.477 --> 19:30.060
but with you it's something different.

19:30.145 --> 19:32.429
Oh, wait a minute. I
got to show you this.

19:32.514 --> 19:34.397
Okay, see this closet?

19:34.483 --> 19:36.016
I don't know if you've heard about this,

19:36.101 --> 19:39.102
but this is the actual
closet where Warren Harding

19:39.238 --> 19:41.771
fathered a child with
his teenage mistress.

19:41.857 --> 19:45.158
They left that off our fifth grade tour.

19:46.695 --> 19:48.612
Did they show you the residence?

19:48.697 --> 19:51.414
Nope.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.950
Uh, you want to see the residence?

19:54.086 --> 19:55.452
Uh, yeah.

19:55.537 --> 19:57.170
Okay.

19:59.007 --> 20:01.875
- Fuck, today.
- Now, was that a vote in favor of today?

20:01.960 --> 20:05.045
Oh, that was a fuck, comma, today, yes!

20:35.994 --> 20:38.245
How are your illegitimate children?

20:38.330 --> 20:40.830
I asked my sister to send
me a change of clothes

20:40.966 --> 20:43.667

to bring them herself.

was, like, part of Las Vegas.

that with President Hughes.

kind of going through the motions.

That's very flattering.

- We got to get you out of here.

Yeah, thank you.

- No, no, no, I did, too.

is do we put a full recount

or do we just focus on Reno and Vegas?

22:19.731 --> 22:23.850

two fires, one glove situation.

hand to put the glove on.

You mean Nevada. Nevada.

22:36.448 --> 22:38.281

- You said Nebraska.

Charlie Baird is a friend of mine.

to any administration.

Are you kidding me? Did you take
a shower at least in between?

23:47.068 --> 23:49.986
It was just a preliminary
meeting regarding his cabinet.

23:50.071 --> 23:52.238
Were you thinking about his cabinet
while you were fucking me?

even have a cabinet.
