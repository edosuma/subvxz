NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.137 --> 00:06.507
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.509
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.542 --> 00:10.511
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.544 --> 00:12.046
are members of an elite squad

00:12.080 --> 00:13.681
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.384
These are their stories.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.753
Right here, get yourself some.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.056
Hey, Mercedes.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.757
I want to talk to you.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.259
Scum bucket!

00:25.293 --> 00:26.794
I'm not good
enough for you?

00:26.827 --> 00:28.829
Move on, ladies,
let's go.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.798
Take it somewhere else, ladies.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.766
Or sir.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.435
Don't call me sir.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.603
I'm a lady.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.071
You treat me like one.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.539
I'll treat you to a
night in the joint,

00:38.572 --> 00:39.707
you don't haul your
ass out of here.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.543
You so interested in my ass,
you know where to find it.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.578
Yeah, the big girls'
department at Macys.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.080
You think you got her size?

00:46.114 --> 00:48.149
Check that-- probably
right in the act.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.418
How's he explain getting busted
to his wife?

00:50.451 --> 00:51.719
Zip it up, sir.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.288
Both of you,
out of the car.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.490
Sir, let's go.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.200
Good morning, sunshine.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.336
What do we got?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.871
White male, 30s,
with this tied around his neck.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.873
Oh. Any signs
of a struggle?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.742
No bruising.
It looks like she blitzed him.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.111
I tell you, I've never seen
a hooker use her hot-pants

01:17.145 --> 01:18.279
to strangle a john before.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.580
It's not hot-pants,
Elliott.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.781
They're leggings.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.416
You wear them
to the gym.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.153
So, we're looking for a hooker
who works out.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.487
That should narrow down
the search.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.689
Take a look inside.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.160
Condom. CSU says
semen on the inside,

01:32.193 --> 01:33.127
lipstick on the outside.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.663
Well, somebody's still
practicing safe sex.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.864
Any ID?

01:36.897 --> 01:38.732
Wallet and credit cards
are missing,

01:38.766 --> 01:40.834
but the car's registered
to a Jeffrey York.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.870
West Side address.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.372
Hold on.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.507
Let me see the body.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.215
He's an Assistant
DA in the Bronx.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.349
You know him?

01:56.384 --> 01:58.486
I dated him.

02:02.490 --> 02:06.760
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:06.794 --> 02:09.497
and NBC

02:49.537 --> 02:51.805
Hey, thought you
could use this.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.774
I had to wake the Bronx
District Attorney

02:53.807 --> 02:55.276
at 2:00 in the morning,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.245
tell him one of his ADAs
was found dead in his car

02:57.278 --> 02:58.612
on a known prostitution stroll.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.814
Now, he says we're not jumping
to any conclusions.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.316
Are we?

03:02.350 --> 03:03.484
No...guy just liked hanging out

03:03.517 --> 03:05.353
with hookers in his spare time.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.987
Hookers cut or stab,
they don't strangle.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.757
Unless they're on crack--
then, hell, they'll do anything.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.225
How many women do you know

03:11.259 --> 03:12.926
with the upper body strength
to choke a guy?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.027
Could have
been a tranny.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.730
Look, Jeff York wasn't the kind
of guy for street sex,

03:16.764 --> 03:19.533
and definitely
not transvestites.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.268
Look, everyone's got
secrets, you know?

03:20.301 --> 03:21.502
You think you
know someone.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.370
I knew Jeff.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.372
Mm-hmm. So, what was
he doing down there?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.473
CRAGEN:
York's an ADA.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.775
We have to consider
the possibility he was set up.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.443
Sometimes it's just
like it looks.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.311
Crime Scene's lifted prints

03:30.344 --> 03:32.413
from the passenger
door handle of the car

03:32.446 --> 03:33.481
and the dead guy's
belt buckle.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.849
Left them there when
she was performing her services.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.318
You mean he.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.487
Prints match a guy--
Kevin Brown.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.689
AKA Keisha Brown.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.824
Known transvestite prostitute.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.259
Couple of
assault collars.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.527
No last
known address.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.362
Okay, well,
patrol cops rousted a tranny

03:48.396 --> 03:50.398
working that block
right before they found Jeff.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.500
Bronx DA is sending us
York's case files

03:52.533 --> 03:53.567
for the last three years.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.002
Fin, go through it
with Munch,

03:55.035 --> 03:56.304
looking for anything
that smells like that M.O.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.572
or somebody
who'd set him up.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.040
It's almost 6:00.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.610
Keisha's probably back
for the morning traffic.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.645
KEISHA:
Not me, boys and girls.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.779
I didn't kill him.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.381
STABLER:
We know you
were in the car.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.382
Now, which one of them bitches

04:08.416 --> 04:09.049
told you that?

04:09.082 --> 04:09.983
Your prints were
on the door.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.685
STABLER
And on the
john. Stop!

04:11.719 --> 04:13.321
Stop. Come here.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.323
Stay cool.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.324
My shoes are glued.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.325
I touched the car,

04:17.358 --> 04:18.726
but I didn't kill him.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.860
As a matter of fact,

04:19.893 --> 04:20.761
he was already dead.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.563
What, did you roll
him for his wallet?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.698
I took a blue gym bag
from the back seat.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.999
There was nothing in it.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.568
Just some clothes, that's it.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.902
Who bought the credit cards?

04:28.936 --> 04:30.538
Hello? Can you hear me?
I said,

04:30.571 --> 04:31.572
the wallet was already gone.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.040
BENSON:
Where's the bag?

04:33.073 --> 04:34.442
You taking me in?

04:34.475 --> 04:36.043
STABLER:
Where is it?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.678
You don't book me for murder.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.681
We get the bag,
we'll talk.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.750
Dumpster at the underpass.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.419
The clothes didn't suit me.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.421
O'HALLORAN:
Mouthwash,

04:47.455 --> 04:49.089
sprays, deodorant.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.759
Who knew hookers used so many
personal hygiene products?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.761
We're looking
for a blue bag.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.763
Blue vinyl bag.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.899
You know, I don't remember
you ever mentioning Jeff York.

04:58.932 --> 04:59.933
It was five
years ago.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.402
Uh, I worked a
case with him.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.570
It wasn't that serious.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.604
Hmm? How long did you date?

05:03.637 --> 05:04.872
About a month.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.007
Nice guy,
no chemistry.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.377
Got your blue vinyl gym bag.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.613
Sneakers, red lycra top.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.915
That lycra top goes
with the leggings.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.618
Uh, business card's got
a phone number--

05:17.651 --> 05:20.421
Tina Gardner, investigator
for the Bronx DA.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.722
Office romance gone wrong?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.424
Why leave the
bag in his car?

05:23.457 --> 05:24.725
I don't know.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.429
Why don't we call
and find out?

05:28.462 --> 05:29.763
( sighs )

05:31.532 --> 05:34.034
WOMAN:
We played handball
two nights a week.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.436
Jeff drove.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.638
I forgot my bag
in his back seat on Monday.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.639
Were you seeing him?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.642
No, I was his investigator,
and we were friends.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.444
I can't believe he's gone.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.878
I just saw him last night.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.780
What time?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.782
Around 6:00,
leaving the office.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.818
He said he was going home.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.820
I don't understand.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.455
Paying for sex?

05:54.488 --> 05:55.789
That's not Jeff.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.058
Do you remember what
was in your bag?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.727
Shoes. Uh, gym clothes.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.529
Can you describe
the clothes?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.730
Red lycra top, leggings...

06:02.763 --> 06:04.465
BENSON:
Do you carry
lipstick?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.667
In the bag? I think so. Why?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.536
What brand?
Uh, Melanie Jones.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.803
Uh, Blush Rose.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.171
Why does that matter?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.706
It's got to be Alvarez.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.075
Who's Alvarez?
Guy we convicted last week
for murder.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.011
He got the max,
threatened Jeff in open court.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.481
STABLER:
How serious
was that threat?

06:20.514 --> 06:23.784
He said Jeff was a dead man,
he tried his last case.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.185
Jeff seem worried?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.286
He shrugged it off.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.789
But you should talk
to the other ADA on the case,

06:28.822 --> 06:29.957
Andy Abbott.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.492
MAN:
Jeff's like

06:31.525 --> 06:32.826
the rest of us.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.928
A skel threatens revenge,
he wouldn't buckle.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.697
They asked for a deal,
Jeff said no.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.832
You're saying he
should have made one?

06:38.866 --> 06:40.668
If you collared someone
for murder,

06:40.701 --> 06:43.070
and he threatened to kill you,
would you let him walk?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.605
No, and neither would Jeff.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.839
So, who is this
guy he convicted?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.708
This, uh, Alvarez?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.543
Small-time dealer
in Mott Haven

06:49.577 --> 06:51.545
trying to go big,
racked up three bodies.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.947
He strangled them,
and he got off on the first two.

06:53.981 --> 06:54.948
BENSON:
What happened?

06:54.982 --> 06:56.083
Well, the first murder

06:56.116 --> 06:57.751
we're pretty sure
was jury tampering.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.753
His lawyer was indicted,
but we couldn't prove it.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.690
Second one,
our chief witness recanted.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.157
Third time's a charm.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.793
Tell my wife that.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.995
She was worried about revenge,
wanted me off the case.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.998
She begged Jeff to plead it out
or at least get protection.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.468
News did this interview
right after the trial.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.036
MAN:
And what
about the violent threats?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.771
You get used to it.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.807
Defendants say these things
all the time.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.208
If we walked away
from every case

07:21.241 --> 07:24.044
where we were afraid of revenge,
we couldn't do our job.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.613
Jeff loved
being a DA.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.816
You know, the ethics
for him were...

07:28.849 --> 07:30.050
almost biblical.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.753
BENSON:
Sounds like you were more
worried than he was.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.687
Let me tell you something.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.690
This Alvarez was more vicious
than most.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.760
I told Jeff, you have a permit,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.762
carry a gun, just for a while.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.763
I do.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.164
He just laughed.

07:44.197 --> 07:48.068
Said he'd be so scared
of shooting himself by accident.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.236
Takes a pair
of balls

07:49.269 --> 07:51.038
to order a hit
on a prosecutor.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.641
Well, don't take my word for it,
go see him.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.243
And tell him Jeff says hello.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.949
MAN:
That DA Jeff York?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.951
Yeah, I put a hit on him.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.686
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.855
I think he knows
exactly what he's saying.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.791
The guy sends me away, I
get him whacked that night.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.560
My client's having
a little fun here.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.694
Well, you want some fun?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.262
Go to Coney Island
and ride the Cyclone.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.565
I don't find dead prosecutors
all that amusing.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.132
Oh, easy, Mami,
it was a joke.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.802
Mr. Alvarez is looking
at 25 hard.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.572
He's angry, but not angry enough
to kill a DA.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.739
You'd do it for him,

08:25.773 --> 08:27.541
Mr. Horner?
Detective...

08:27.575 --> 08:29.743
I get my clients out of
jail legally, Detective.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.978
I resent your implication.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.746
STABLER:
Mr. Horner, you were indicted

08:32.780 --> 08:33.914
for jury tampering.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.749
Not to mention
your eyewitness had amnesia,

08:35.783 --> 08:36.950
and then, of course,
disappeared.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.552
I'm sorry. Are we offending you?

08:38.586 --> 08:39.787
The indictment
was crap.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.789
Nobody ever proved
I bribed the witness.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.323
Why don't you tell your partner

08:43.356 --> 08:44.692
to relax?

08:44.725 --> 08:45.959
I assure you,
neither my client

08:45.993 --> 08:47.628
nor I had
anything to do

08:47.661 --> 08:48.896
with Jeff
York's murder.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.063
Then you won't object

08:50.097 --> 08:51.865
to us taking a peek
at your phone records.

08:51.899 --> 08:52.966
I'm ahead of you.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.034
My, uh, office, my house,

08:54.067 --> 08:55.202
my cell phone, all my logs.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.804
Check 'em with the
phone company.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.171
BENSON:
And how about you,
Mr. Alvarez?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.073
Have you had any
interesting visitors lately?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.074
No one has come

09:01.108 --> 09:02.976
to see me except my lawyer here.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.845
Why don't you check
with the warden?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.046
STABLER:
Forget Alvarez.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.247
His story checks out.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.349
Lawyer doesn't have
any suspicious calls.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.284
Where are you on
York's case files?

09:11.318 --> 09:12.986
Still in 2003.
Nothing jumps out.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.723
In my copious free time,
I ran the M.O.--

09:15.756 --> 09:18.959
strangulation, prostitute,
oral sex. Zip.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.027
Run it again.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.896
Put in the leggings, the car,
and sort by location.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.065
FIN:
Since 9-11, you have
to swipe a card

09:25.098 --> 09:27.034
to get out
of the courthouse garage.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.902
Jeff York left last night
at 6:14.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.004
Corroborates what his
investigator told us.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.140
M.E. says he was killed
between 9:00 and 10:00.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.375
That leaves three-plus hours
unaccounted for.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.777
Captain,

09:36.810 --> 09:38.812
Bronx DA in the house.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.982
I'm looking
for Captain Cragen.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.350
I'm Don Cragen.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.185
Francisco Martinez.

09:45.218 --> 09:48.055
Can we talk privately?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.026
I'm afraid we don't have much
to tell you.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.294
I appreciate
how sensitively

09:54.327 --> 09:55.829
you're handling this.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.198
Actually, I'm here to
give you information.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.770
Jeff York's bank statements.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.205
Stamped "received"
by your office two weeks ago.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.908
You had him under investigation?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.977
Informant at Rikers says
Alvarez was bragging

10:10.010 --> 10:11.945
he bought off York
to throw the trial.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.213
You find a money trail?

10:13.246 --> 10:14.948
Yeah, but
in the wrong direction.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.918
Look at the ATM withdrawals.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.119
500 bucks every
three days.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.321
That's a lot of money
on an ADA's salary.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.990
How'd he pay his bills?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.157
He didn't.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.159
Credit rating's in the toilet.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.260
So, you're thinking

10:27.294 --> 10:28.996
York was into what,
gambling, drugs?

10:29.029 --> 10:29.863
I don't know.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.999
But I'm taking it away
from my people

10:32.032 --> 10:33.066
and giving it to you.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.935
You got a
leaky office?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.004
Captain, Jeff York
was a good man.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.038
One of my rising stars.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.941
I want to find out
who killed him just as much

10:40.974 --> 10:42.976
as you do.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.247
Jeff York had 30 bucks

10:47.280 --> 10:49.116
in his checking account
the night he died.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.751
Well, he wasn't buying drugs.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.219
M.E. says
his tox came back clean.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.187
Look, Captain,
I got to say that I think

10:54.221 --> 10:57.024
Olivia's getting a little
overzealous about this case.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.959
Well, I might be,
too, if I were her.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.360
Hey, Captain,
I called the lab.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.029
I wanted them to run something.

11:02.062 --> 11:02.896
You know the lipstick?

11:02.930 --> 11:04.998
Yeah, but you don't need
to call the lab.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.734
If they got anything,
they'll talk us.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.135
Hold on, Elliot, just listen.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.103
The DA's investigator
who worked for Jeff told us

11:10.137 --> 11:11.271
that she carried lipstick

11:11.304 --> 11:13.240
in her gym bag,
but we never found it.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.908
The color was Blush Rose.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.011
I had the lab run a gas chromo
on the lipstick on the condom.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.346
Blush Rose.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.715
That would mean a hooker
had to get the lipstick

11:21.749 --> 11:24.017
out of the gym bag, put it on,
then perform oral sex.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.185
I don't buy it.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.887
So, who's the gal
with the lips?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.889
Well, since you're going
to the lab,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.792
see if she left some saliva
for DNA along with the lipstick.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.794
SIPER:
Sorry.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.296
No saliva, but I did
find something interesting.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.332
Lipstick left this imprint
on the condom.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.801
BENSON:
It's a crisp,

11:40.834 --> 11:41.969
clean print.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.136
And a problem.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.838
Oral sex-- it
should be smudged.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.006
Right.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.107
I think the lip print was put

11:47.140 --> 11:48.776
on the condom after it was used.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.243
BENSON:
You're saying
she put a condom

11:50.277 --> 11:51.444
on him, killed him...

11:51.478 --> 11:55.015
Then kissed
it afterwards.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.417
After Siper sent me
these photos of the lip prints,

11:57.450 --> 11:59.286
I went back and focused
on the sex act.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.822
I looked at the victim's
seminal vesicles.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.423
If he had had sex
before he died,

12:03.456 --> 12:05.025
there'd be
semen in them.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.193
There isn't.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.828
And none on his body.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.062
That's impossible.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.197
You saw the condom.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.765
DNA results are back.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.867
Take a look
at these two chromolines.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.837
This is Jeff York's DNA,

12:16.870 --> 12:18.038
and this is the DNA

12:18.071 --> 12:19.873
from the semen
in the condom found

12:19.907 --> 12:21.541
in York's car.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.077
They're not the same.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.513
There were two men in that car.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.181
The operative word being men.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.249
STABLER:
Well,

12:29.282 --> 12:31.518
no wonder you and Jeff
didn't have any chemistry.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.486
He was gay.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.960
"Murdered D.A.
in Gay Sex Slay."

12:39.993 --> 12:40.961
The papers are
loving this.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.430
Branch wants facts to
counter the bad press.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.265
All we know
is Jeff York was gay

12:45.298 --> 12:47.100
and had sex in his car
with another man.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.969
What about the tranny
prostitute angle?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.805
Keisha Brown's DNA didn't match
the sample in the condom.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.273
No other he/shes work
that stroll.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.808
Then what happened
in that car?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.009
Well, we know
what didn't happen.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.878
The wallet was stolen;
the credit cards

12:57.911 --> 12:59.112
were unused.
First thing a hooker's

12:59.146 --> 13:00.113
going to do when she rolls
a john is use

13:00.147 --> 13:02.850
those credit cards
or sell 'em.
So robbery's not

13:02.883 --> 13:04.818
the motive.
!
But we're supposed
to think it is.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.954
Look, this is a well-known
lover's lane here.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.956
Maybe Jeff just picked up a guy,
had a good time with him.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.958
Then what's the
motive to kill him?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.325
Could be an accident.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.862
Jeff liked it rough, and
our mystery man went too far.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.762
You guys, I got
to tell you

13:15.795 --> 13:17.297
that Jeff seemed
pretty vanilla to me.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.066
Maybe you didn't date him
long enough.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.200
CRAGEN:
Sounds like
there's a lot

13:20.233 --> 13:21.334
you didn't
know about Jeff.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.269
His apartment

13:22.302 --> 13:24.071
is still sealed--
get over there and see

13:24.104 --> 13:26.039
if you can find out more
about his love life.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.115
BENSON:
Not much of a social life.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.017
The only dates in here
are dinners with people

13:37.050 --> 13:39.853
from the office,
notes on cases to discuss.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.989
The guy's got a awful
lot of medical bills.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.859
Day he died, he had drinks
with Andy Abbott, Carlson Hotel.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.494
Did Abbott mention that to us?

13:47.527 --> 13:50.998
No. You know, there's
got to be $10,000
worth of bills here,

13:51.031 --> 13:53.466
all of 'em marked
"paid" in cash.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.267
You know,

13:54.301 --> 13:57.170
maybe that's where
his money went.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.073
He has insurance
through the D.A.'s office.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.380
Yet I'm guessing he didn't
use it to pay for this.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.352
That's AZT.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.054
He was HIV-positive.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.222
Yeah, he paid for
his treatments

14:15.255 --> 14:18.225
in cash so his office
wouldn't find out.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.195
You okay?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.364
Yeah...
'Cause, you know,
if you slept with Jeff,

14:24.397 --> 14:26.033
you might want to...
I'm going to
get tested.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.902
You don't want the results
in departmental records,
insurance,

14:28.936 --> 14:30.370
so go to an anonymous
clinic, okay?

14:30.403 --> 14:32.940
I know. Like Jeff did.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.909
Look, you want me
to go with you?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.077
No, I'll be fine.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.046
Let's just focus
on the case.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.381
Jeff's date book said
that he was having drinks

14:41.414 --> 14:43.216
with Andy Abbott
the night he was killed,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.418
so why didn't Andy
tell us that?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.557
I'm sorry, uh...

14:50.590 --> 14:53.560
Jeff and I always went out
for drinks after work.

14:53.593 --> 14:57.097
I was so upset by the news,
I must've forgotten.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.265
Well, Jeff

14:58.298 --> 14:59.933
told your investigator

14:59.967 --> 15:01.568
that he was
going right home.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.203
Why would Jeff lie
about having drinks

15:03.236 --> 15:05.238
with you?
Well, that's strange.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.574
He-he told me he was meeting
someone for dinner later.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.076
BENSON:
Do you have any idea who?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.944
He didn't say, and I didn't ask.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.313
He didn't talk about
his personal life very much.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.314
Uh, Andy, so you had

15:14.347 --> 15:16.116
no idea Jeff York was gay.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.952
( doorbell rings )

15:18.986 --> 15:22.255
Honey. Honey, could you get
the door?

15:22.289 --> 15:24.257
I'm really surprised.
Are you sure?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.226
Jeff-Jeff didn't seem gay.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.594
Sometimes you can't tell.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.429
Well, he didn't...
he didn't give me

15:29.462 --> 15:31.498
that vibe.
Excuse me, Detectives,

15:31.531 --> 15:33.633
I'm sorry to
interrupt, but the
baby-sitter's here,

15:33.666 --> 15:35.135
We're going to be late.
All right.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.071
Hey. Good night, baby.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.072
ALLY:
Good night, Daddy.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.440
Okay.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.442
Would you get this
for me?

15:42.475 --> 15:45.445
I left Jeff sitting in the bar
at the Carlson.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.148
I mean, I would've stayed,
but I had my poker game.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.984
He said he had about half
an hour to kill before dinner,

15:51.018 --> 15:53.620
and was going
to hang there.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.122
He sat over there
by the window.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.990
I remember thinking
he was cute.

15:57.024 --> 15:57.991
Was he with anyone?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.192
A black guy, shaved head.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.094
If I'd been drinking
instead of working,

16:01.128 --> 16:02.129
I'd have hit on both of 'em.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.463
Yeah? They leave together?

16:03.496 --> 16:04.764
No, the black
guy split first.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.299
He was here maybe
another half hour.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.468
He left a nice tip, though.
Not like the tourists.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.470
And he didn't meet
anyone else?

16:10.503 --> 16:14.174
Nope. He just finished
his drink and went.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.209
This hotel's a little pricey
for your average D.A.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.345
Inconvenient. There's plenty of
bars near the Bronx courthouse.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.747
It's perfect if you don't
want your colleagues
to see you, though.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.115
Think he was meeting
a boyfriend?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.183
Let's find out.
Hey, how you doing?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.185
May I help you?
Detective Stabler.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.054
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.056
This man look familiar?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.258
Yeah, Mr. York.
He's a regular guest.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.126
How often did
he stay here?
Once a week

16:33.160 --> 16:35.028
for a night.
STABLER:
Alone?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.529
Always checked in that way.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.165
He check in
on Wednesday night?

16:38.198 --> 16:40.267
He wanted a
room, but we were
completely booked.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.335
I offered to call other hotels,

16:42.369 --> 16:44.804
but he said it wasn't
that important and he left.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.439
And you're sure he
wasn't with anyone.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.507
Not on his way out.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.142
I did see him
on his way in

16:49.176 --> 16:51.044
talking to-- what's his name?

16:51.078 --> 16:53.613
Football player.
DuShawn McGovern.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.316
Oh, yeah, he used to be
a running back with Miami.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.684
Right. Big-shot
in real estate now.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.553
I almost asked him
for an autograph.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.193
I was meeting an out-of-town
client when I ran into Jeff

17:06.226 --> 17:09.196
in the lobby...
so we sat down and talked.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.697
How do you know him?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.200
We met at a kids'
charity benefit.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.701
He knew I was into real estate,

17:14.734 --> 17:16.369
wanted to list his apartment
with us.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.370
We saw that apartment.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.506
It seems a little down-market
for your company.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.709
He was a nice guy.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.711
Uh, I didn't want
to blow him off.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.213
He seemed desperate.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.547
To sell?
I got the feeling

17:27.580 --> 17:29.716
he had money problems.
( phone rings )

17:29.749 --> 17:32.385
Mr. McGovern, where'd you go
after you left the hotel?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.821
Uh, back here
to the office,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.256
then out with some friends.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.091
I'd be glad to give you
their names.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.261
We'll get in touch
with you if necessary.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.130
Thank you for your time.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.732
That was Fin.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.135
He's got something
we'll want to hear.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.571
We know who got the idea

17:51.604 --> 17:53.740
to dress up Jeff's murder
as a hooker killing.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.743
Case one: bridge underpass
in the Bronx a year ago.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.579
Guy in a car picks up
a transvestite prostitute.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.414
She strangled him
with a pair of pantyhose.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.283
Case two: South Bronx.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.186
A hooker beats up a john in
a car, leaves him unconscious.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.754
Condom with lipstick
found on scene.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.789
Case three: john
picks up transvestite

18:09.822 --> 18:12.192
pross-- he's mugged,
and she takes his wallet.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.193
You got three
separate cases,

18:13.226 --> 18:15.128
each with pieces
of our M.O.?

18:15.162 --> 18:16.496
Can't be a coincidence.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.331
All in the Bronx.
All went to trial.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.600
All prosecuted
by Jeff York.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.170
Wrong guy. Andy Abbott
tried 'em all.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.474
Andy killed Jeff York?

18:32.479 --> 18:34.714
Why did Andy Abbott
kill Jeff York?

18:34.747 --> 18:35.748
Lovers' quarrel gone wrong.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.818
Jeff was gay. Is there
any evidence Andy Abbott is?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.487
Wife and kids don't
mean he's straight.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.355
DNA from the semen
in that condom's

18:42.389 --> 18:44.624
going to prove Andy Abbott
was in the car.
We don't have

18:44.657 --> 18:47.627
enough evidence
to compel a DNA sample.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.662
Three pieces of the M.O.
are in three cases he tried.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.698
Circumstantial. He'll claim
someone was framing him.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.699
Bring him in
for a chat.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.567
Lock him with a story
and then disprove it.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.568
( phone ringing )

18:55.602 --> 18:56.669
What?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.671
He's been watching
cops work suspects
for years.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.507
We bring him in, he's
just going to lawyer up.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.209
Okay, so we don't play him
like a perp.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.843
Just tell him we're stuck
and we need his help.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.512
I'll send her over.

19:05.545 --> 19:10.550
Elliot, go enlist
Andy's cooperation.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.520
Warner wants to see you
at the morgue.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.422
I tested

19:15.455 --> 19:16.423
Jeff York's blood.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.857
High viral load.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.692
When did you two date?

19:19.726 --> 19:20.860
Five years ago.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.395
We only slept
together once,

19:22.429 --> 19:23.530
and we used protection.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.233
Condoms are effective,
not perfect.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.900
It only takes once.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.337
I'm going to get tested.
I just haven't had time.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.405
Why don't we do
it here right now?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.907
Wanda... I'll do it.

19:34.941 --> 19:35.908
Olivia...

19:35.942 --> 19:37.244
how many rape victims

19:37.277 --> 19:38.578
have you told to get tested?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.247
All of them.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.915
Would you tell them
it's all right to wait?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.554
Okay.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.422
Sit down and roll up
your sleeve.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.325
No paperwork.
I'll do the test myself.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.571
Could Jeff have been
HIV-positive back then?

20:04.604 --> 20:07.607
Yes, but your risk
of exposure's very low.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.742
How could I have
missed this?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.911
Liv...

20:11.944 --> 20:15.948
you're not the first woman
to sleep with a closeted man.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.919
Maybe he didn't
know, right?

20:19.952 --> 20:22.455
Sexuality's
very complicated.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.291
Just because he was gay

20:24.324 --> 20:26.759
doesn't mean he wasn't
attracted to you.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.762
WOMAN:
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Andy Abbott.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.899
That's Andy's wife.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.301
Mrs. Abbott.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.303
Andy left a message
canceling lunch.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.637
Said he was headed
down here.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.938
Is there a break
in the case?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.740
I'll see you inside.
I don't know.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.809
I just got back.
Oh, Jeff was
our best friend.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.612
Do you have a suspect?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.780
You know that I can't
discuss that with you.

20:47.814 --> 20:51.484
Believe me, I'm used to that
after all these years.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.753
Andy's not answering his cell.
Do you know where he is?

20:53.786 --> 20:57.657
I don't, but if I see him,
I'll tell him to call you.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.630
What's going on?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.965
Andy's reviewing
D.A. files.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.800
He's looking for
defendants with
a grudge.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.002
He doesn't know
we suspect him yet.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.638
I can't stop thinking
about his wife.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.507
Jeff was HIV-positive,
and Andy might be, too.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.842
Makes you want
to warn her.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.010
Can we do that... legally?
Absolutely not.

21:18.044 --> 21:21.013
HIV status is confidential
even after death.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.750
So, I'm getting him coffee,
and he's hard at work.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.751
Maryellen
Abbott was here.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.752
She wants to know

21:25.785 --> 21:27.487
what's going on; I stalled her.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.988
Give me a couple minutes
to heat him up.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.690
Let's play the wife card.

21:32.559 --> 21:36.996
STABLER:
Here you go.
Thanks.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.666
I've been over
all my old files,

21:39.699 --> 21:42.535
and, uh, I can't think
of anywhere else to look.

21:42.569 --> 21:43.903
Well, the perp
had to know

21:43.936 --> 21:45.538
about your
hooker cases.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.741
M.O. copies the
three that you tried.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.378
Well, if there's a connection,
I'm not seeing it.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.580
We need to look harder.

21:54.581 --> 21:58.017
Well, what else could we do?

21:58.050 --> 22:00.387
Let's try to imagine
how someone could put together

22:00.420 --> 22:02.689
these M.O.s
in one crime.

22:02.722 --> 22:07.059
Hmm? Unless it
was an inside job.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.729
You think I killed him?

22:09.762 --> 22:13.766
STABLER:
I think we have a very
strange coincidence.

22:16.603 --> 22:17.870
Le-Let's be clear.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.038
Mm-hmm.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.740
Am I a suspect?

22:20.773 --> 22:21.874
Why, you want a lawyer?

22:21.908 --> 22:25.645
I don't need one.
I am a lawyer.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.751
What possible motive could
I have had to kill Jeff?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.586
He's one of my
closest friends.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.422
No, you were a lot more
than friends.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.723
You were having
a relationship.

22:36.756 --> 22:37.890
You're crazy.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.726
No. You couldn't let
your wife find out,

22:39.759 --> 22:41.060
so you strangled him.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.595
She stopped by,
by the way.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.896
She's very concerned.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.735
What did you tell Maryellen?

22:48.768 --> 22:49.902
Nothing.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.439
Yet.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.073
Don't threaten me,

22:54.106 --> 22:55.608
Detective.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.578
If you say one word
about this preposterous lie

22:58.611 --> 22:59.812
to her or anyone else,

22:59.846 --> 23:02.449
you're looking
at departmental charges

23:02.482 --> 23:03.850
and a lawsuit for slander.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.151
To make a case
for slander,

23:05.184 --> 23:08.087
you have to prove
that we said things
we knew were false.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.756
So far, everything fits.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.924
You're forcing
the pieces together.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.860
If you weren't
Jeff's lover,

23:13.893 --> 23:14.794
then you can prove it.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.896
All you have to do
is give us a DNA sample.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.665
You think I'm stupid.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.799
High profile case,

23:19.832 --> 23:21.934
political pressure
to make an arrest.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.804
I'm not giving you evidence
you can use to frame me.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.873
Andy, you're not
convincing me.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.475
I couldn't have killed Jeff.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.876
I wasn't even there.

23:29.909 --> 23:30.943
Where were you?

23:30.977 --> 23:33.780
Jeff and I had drinks
at the Carlson.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.014
He said he had dinner plans,

23:35.047 --> 23:36.949
and he was still
there when I left.

23:36.983 --> 23:37.950
So, where'd you go?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.952
I told you--
my poker game.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.822
Like I do
every Wednesday night.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.896
MAN:
Andy got to the poker game

23:49.929 --> 23:50.897
right after I did.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.033
Had to be around,
I don't know, 8:15, 8:30.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.802
He seem okay?

23:55.835 --> 23:56.969
He was pretty stressed.

23:57.003 --> 23:57.970
STABLER:
About what?

23:58.004 --> 23:58.971
Some murderer they convicted.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.973
The guy threatened
to kill Andy's trial partner.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.141
Mr. Baker, you sure

24:02.174 --> 24:03.810
about the time
Andy got to the poker game?

24:03.843 --> 24:05.978
Definitely. 8:30, latest.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.548
You remember
what he was wearing?

24:09.549 --> 24:10.817
What's this about?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.151
I thought Andy was on your side.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.219
We're all working
on this together.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.621
Then why does it sound

24:14.654 --> 24:15.822
like you're accusing Andy
of something?

24:15.855 --> 24:16.823
BENSON:
Just routine background.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.158
You play poker at the
same place every week?

24:19.191 --> 24:20.693
No, this one was at my place.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.595
My wife and I have a brownstone
in Park Slope.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.496
Did your wife stay for the game?

24:23.530 --> 24:25.965
She and a girlfriend
go to the movies.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.635
Five or six brothers,
a couple of beers...

24:28.668 --> 24:30.903
It gets a little rowdy.

24:30.937 --> 24:31.971
So then there were six of you?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.272
Five.

24:33.305 --> 24:37.610
Less money on the table
but a better game.

24:37.644 --> 24:38.578
It's a heavy action game,
no limit.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.279
FIN:
These the brothers
that play poker?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.648
Yeah.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.650
This guy looks familiar.

24:43.683 --> 24:44.884
DuShawn McGovern.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.886
Used to play for Miami.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.087
STABLER:
If DuShawn McGovern

24:48.120 --> 24:49.622
was at that game
with Andy Abbott,

24:49.656 --> 24:50.957
why didn't Andy tell us?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.659
'Cause Andy doesn't
want us to know

24:52.692 --> 24:53.860
that DuShawn's a friend.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.662
CRAGEN:
Well, here's what
I don't get.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.564
Why are they all
protecting Abbott?

24:57.597 --> 24:59.298
Maybe they've all
have something to hide.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.633
Like what?

25:00.667 --> 25:02.134
I think they're on the Down Low.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.302
Down what?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.637
The Down Low.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.739
Black men having sex
with other men.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.741
Every one of these guys is
married, some have kids.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.876
That's sex
on the Down Low.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.678
They say it doesn't mean
they're gay.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.112
What does it mean?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.313
It's just sex.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.514
They hang out,
have a few drinks,

25:15.548 --> 25:18.651
pretend that what goes on
downstairs isn't who they are.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.886
You grow up being black,

25:19.919 --> 25:22.154
you're supposed to be a man,
become a father.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.791
Church, your family,
your friends--

25:24.824 --> 25:28.561
they all see being gay
as the white man's perversion.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.663
But white men have trouble
dealing with it, too.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.799
There's an epidemic of gay
white men on crystal meth.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.567
They have to get high
to have sex.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.668
It's different for black men.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.169
They go out,
have sex with other men,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.871
then come home,
have sex with their woman

25:38.905 --> 25:40.139
and pretend they're straight.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.710
Don't look at me.

25:43.743 --> 25:44.811
I just know stuff.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.346
Go back,
reinterview McGovern.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.315
FIN:
No.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.550
Let me.

25:54.854 --> 25:58.090
McGOVERN:
Those other detectives never
asked me where I was going.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.727
I offered to give them names.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.862
You say you got to your poker
game at 8:30.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.932
Your office says you were
in a meeting till 8:00.

26:05.965 --> 26:09.335
You got all the way
out to Brooklyn in a half hour?

26:09.368 --> 26:10.970
Maybe it was 9:00.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.139
You married, DuShawn?

26:15.407 --> 26:16.909
Divorced.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.011
Any kids?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.880
Maybe next time.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.183
You were one helluva ballplayer.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.852
Yeah, those were great years.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.887
Banged up my knees a lot,
but I loved it.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.922
I don't remember you signing
any high-scratch

26:29.956 --> 26:31.758
endorsement deals--
cars, wristwatches.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.225
All the players get something.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.827
There was talk about you

26:34.861 --> 26:37.163
getting some front office jobs,
coaching gigs.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.231
Didn't happen.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.002
What's your problem, brother?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.804
What's your problem?

26:48.841 --> 26:51.077
I was an athlete.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.279
Hero.

26:53.312 --> 26:57.984
Everyone looked up to me--
my family, my friends.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.752
They still do.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.021
I want it to stay that way.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.323
And it won't
if they know you do it with men.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.692
Yo, get clear, bro.

27:05.725 --> 27:06.693
I'm no fag.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.260
You're on the Down Low, dude.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.429
This ain't no poker game.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.866
You guys are having sex
with each other.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.241
Here's the headline:

27:22.274 --> 27:24.343
A black man can make mistakes.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.345
He can even do time.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.347
We stand by 'em.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.082
What we will not stand by

27:30.116 --> 27:32.418
is a black man
who's a homosexual.

27:32.451 --> 27:33.519
Here's my headline:

27:33.552 --> 27:36.723
You were one of the last
people to see Jeff alive.

27:36.756 --> 27:40.026
And if you don't start talking,
I'm gonna dig through your life.

27:40.059 --> 27:43.062
I'm gonna ask everybody you
know about your sex parties.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.933
I am not gay.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.869
I have relationships with women
and sex with men.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.203
And I got news for you.

27:51.237 --> 27:55.007
That means you're gay.

28:01.413 --> 28:05.284
It's been going on
for four years.

28:05.317 --> 28:09.889
Poker night, every week
someone takes the bedroom.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.259
It's like it never happened.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.861
Nobody mentions sex.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.128
You wear protection?

28:16.162 --> 28:16.996
You bring protection,

28:17.029 --> 28:18.931
it's like admitting
why you went there.

28:18.965 --> 28:22.769
How'd Jeff York get
tied up in all this?

28:22.802 --> 28:25.972
Jeff fell in love with Andy
at work.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.941
He wanted Andy
to leave his wife.

28:28.975 --> 28:31.143
Man, Jeff started talking
all this love stuff.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.480
So Andy asked me
to get some sense into him.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.248
You go too far and strangle him?

28:36.282 --> 28:37.750
No!

28:39.251 --> 28:41.420
Well, you're looking
good for it.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.225
Andy did it.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.897
He didn't mean to.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.031
( sighs )

28:52.064 --> 28:54.400
Jeff would've dragged us
all into a mess.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.273
Andy Abbott...

29:01.307 --> 29:04.176
you're under arrest
for the murder of Jeffrey York.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.978
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.380
If I give up that right,
anything I say

29:08.414 --> 29:11.984
can and will be used against me
in a court of law.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.920
I have the right
to an attorney...

29:17.356 --> 29:20.092
How many times
do I have to tell you?

29:20.126 --> 29:21.427
I'm am not gay.

29:21.460 --> 29:26.032
I was not Jeff York's lover
and I did not kill him.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.466
The DNA swab
that we took from you

29:27.499 --> 29:30.502
will match the condom
at the crime scene.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.872
My client can
explain that.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.174
Jeff asked me
to meet him at the bar

29:35.207 --> 29:36.909
at the Carlson to talk.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.110
I knew something was up

29:38.144 --> 29:40.980
because he'd been acting
so tense around me.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.149
I thought it was from Alvarez's
death threat.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.250
But it wasn't.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.052
No. No, that would've been

29:46.085 --> 29:48.520
a helluva lot easier.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.023
Jeff told me
he was in love with me.

29:51.057 --> 29:54.994
I told him I'm sorry,
but I didn't feel the same way.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.997
Bet that didn't go over
too well.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.866
Well, he was embarrassed.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.333
We both got drunk.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.202
When I left
I couldn't get a cab.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.537
Jeff came out,
he saw me waiting.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.975
He said he'd give me a ride
to my poker game.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.978
We drove past some hookers
and he pulled over.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.380
I guess he wanted to prove
his manhood.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.615
I went first.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.418
When she finished
with me, I left.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.420
Took a cab to Brooklyn.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.855
You could've told
us this story

30:22.889 --> 30:24.023
the first time we
interviewed you.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.291
ATTORNEY:
Right. And say

30:25.324 --> 30:27.126
he was in a threesome
with a hooker.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.461
The DA would love to read
that in the tabloids.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.198
Andy'd lose his job and his
family would be humiliated.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.265
I blame myself.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.035
If I hadn't left Jeff there,
he'd still be alive.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.104
BENSON:
You've covered
all your bases...

30:38.137 --> 30:39.171
except one.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.940
Your friend DuShawn McGovern

30:40.973 --> 30:42.541
was at the hotel
talking to Jeff.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.342
Coincidence?

30:43.375 --> 30:45.177
ATTORNEY:
No, business meeting.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.979
My client asked Mr. McGovern

30:47.013 --> 30:49.215
to help Mr. York
sell his apartment.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.582
STABLER:
Wrong answer.
DuShawn says

30:50.616 --> 30:51.717
you admitted killing Jeff York

30:51.750 --> 30:54.120
so your wife wouldn't find out
you're on the Down Low.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.889
Well, I'm sure DuShawn said

30:56.923 --> 31:00.159
exactly what you wanted him
to say.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.629
He knows you'd ruin his life
to make your case.

31:03.662 --> 31:04.463
He's good.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.532
This cockamamie story
might work.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.666
Jury will see
right through him.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.734
Will they?

31:08.767 --> 31:11.904
Handsome DA, family man,
gets drunk with a colleague

31:11.938 --> 31:14.006
and lands in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.174
We can't prove otherwise.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.109
DuShawn McGovern can.

31:17.143 --> 31:20.679
He gave it up to me,
he'll testify for you.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.248
There's no way I'm testifying.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.282
Wait a minute.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.516
Just tell her
what you told me.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.684
I didn't tell you anything.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.652
Mr. McGovern,

31:26.685 --> 31:29.221
you'd be testifying
before the grand jury.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.023
Those proceedings
are kept secret.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.124
Secret?

31:32.158 --> 31:34.193
Jurors go home after I talk,
they'll spread the news.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.227
I know all about gossip.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.595
I lived with it for years
when I played ball.

31:36.628 --> 31:37.629
FIN:
You got no choice.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.031
She'll subpoena you,

31:39.065 --> 31:41.033
and I'll haul your ass in there.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.534
And I'll put my hand
on the Bible

31:42.568 --> 31:43.669
and swear to tell
the whole truth.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.605
I worked too hard to get
where I am to mess it up now.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.673
Go on...

31:47.706 --> 31:50.276
ask me if Andy killed a man.

31:50.309 --> 31:54.913
I'll say, "I don't know
what you're talking about."

31:57.616 --> 32:00.586
If you'll excuse me,
I'm very busy.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.358
There goes our case.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.394
What's it gonna take
to bring it back?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.662
Proof that Jeff York
and Andy Abbott were lovers.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.065
Andy's on the Down Low
and Jeff sure ain't talking.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.734
Yeah, maybe Jeff will talk
to Warner.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.436
The dead can speak.

32:17.469 --> 32:21.673
I ran the DNA from the HIV
virus in Jeff York's
blood.

32:21.707 --> 32:25.677
Here's the genotype
of the HIV strain from Jeff.

32:25.711 --> 32:29.381
I also tested Andy Abbott's
DNA swab for HIV.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.649
He's positive.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.352
Here's Andy's genotype.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.554
The HIV strains
are identical.

32:35.587 --> 32:39.058
So that proves that they had
a sexual relationship?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.626
HIV mutates constantly.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.395
That's a common mutation
to Jeff's HIV.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.731
The exact same mutation
on Andy's.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.299
So one of them
passed it to the other.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.134
Very likely.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.369
Likely enough
to convince a jury?

32:50.402 --> 32:52.304
It's suggestive, not conclusive.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.473
How suggestive? 99%, 95%?

32:54.506 --> 32:56.542
I can't give you
a precise number. Sorry.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.710
That's not good enough
for a jury.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.482
Thanks.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.651
Olivia...

33:05.684 --> 33:07.653
What's up?

33:09.521 --> 33:11.557
You're negative.

33:20.799 --> 33:21.767
NOVAK:
It's not even worth

33:21.800 --> 33:22.601
putting Warner
on the stand.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.670
Abbott's lawyer'll
find five other guys

33:24.703 --> 33:26.172
who have the same
strain of HIV

33:26.205 --> 33:27.506
who didn't know
Andy or Jeff.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.175
Andy Abbott gets
away with murder.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.643
You got company.
She's steamin'.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.512
How can you do this?!

33:33.545 --> 33:36.282
How can you possibly think that
my husband killed our friend?

33:36.315 --> 33:40.152
Mrs. Abbott... we have
credible evidence.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.654
More lies. You knew he was
a suspect when we talked.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.190
Don't lie to me again.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.192
She's telling you
the truth.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.460
Your husband was having
an affair with Jeff York.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.431
I don't believe you.
You're sick.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.700
You don't have to believe me,

33:54.733 --> 33:57.703
but for your own sake,
get an HIV test.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.172
Jeff York had AIDS.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.576
Go to hell!

34:06.712 --> 34:09.715
Should you have
done that?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.717
She needed to know.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.223
ATTORNEY:
Casey.

34:17.256 --> 34:19.391
I'm not backing down.
We're going to trial.

34:19.425 --> 34:20.859
This isn't
about the trial.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.862
This is a complaint
to the Disciplinary
Committee of the Bar

34:23.895 --> 34:26.665
demanding that you
be suspended from
the practice of law.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.400
What are you talking about?

34:28.434 --> 34:31.270
Your unprofessional, if
not criminal, conduct.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.504
You revealed confidential,

34:32.538 --> 34:33.872
legally-protected
medical information

34:33.905 --> 34:35.574
to my client's wife.

34:35.607 --> 34:38.777
I'm trying to protect Maryellen
from contracting HIV.

34:38.810 --> 34:42.414
She thinks that you're
trying to intimidate
her to win your case.

34:42.448 --> 34:45.817
I can tear this up if
we can make a deal.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.419
Let me get this straight.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.721
You're blackmailing me
and in the same breath

34:49.755 --> 34:52.491
accusing me
of ethical impropriety?

34:52.524 --> 34:54.593
I'm defending my client.
I didn't break the law.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.728
Man Two, five years
probation-- take
it or leave it.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.431
I'll take a censure.
I'm betting suspension.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.767
You'll lose your job.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.738
CLARK:
Tell me you didn't do this.

35:06.772 --> 35:07.906
I had to warn her.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.342
She has a right to know
she's at risk.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.278
You had no legal right
to tell her.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.612
Mary...

35:13.645 --> 35:15.681
her life is at stake.
Well, congratulations.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.784
In any other profession, you'd
be Humanitarian of the Year.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.587
You'll be lucky to get
out of this with your skin.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.756
I'm screwed.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.560
You bet your sweet
ass you are.

35:28.594 --> 35:33.265
Did you tell Maryellen about
her husband only to protect her?

35:34.666 --> 35:37.803
Or did you have
something else
in mind?

35:44.843 --> 35:46.712
You shouldn't have come here.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.180
Please hear me out.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.216
I won't discuss the case.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.821
I came to apologize.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.860
( sighs )

36:02.894 --> 36:05.664
I was wrong.

36:05.697 --> 36:09.501
It wasn't my place to tell you.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.870
I keep asking myself why,

36:11.903 --> 36:14.606
and all I can say is,

36:14.640 --> 36:17.243
if I was in your position
I hope

36:17.276 --> 36:19.811
someone would tell me.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.380
You ruined my life.

36:24.516 --> 36:28.554
I didn't expose you to HIV.
Andy did.

36:28.587 --> 36:34.626
And I didn't put Andy's arrest
on the front page, on TV.

36:35.827 --> 36:39.765
I have two children, Ms. Novak.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.268
They're asking me
what their daddy did wrong.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.569
What do I tell them?

36:46.772 --> 36:49.241
I don't know.

36:52.711 --> 36:58.684
And how do I tell them
I'm HIV-positive?

37:01.887 --> 37:03.489
I'm sorry.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.963
I don't want my girls to suffer.

37:15.066 --> 37:19.237
What am I going to do?

37:30.349 --> 37:31.817
You've gone too far, Casey.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.819
When the Disciplinary
Committee hears

37:33.852 --> 37:37.289
you've been harassing
my client's wife,
you'll be disbarred.

37:37.323 --> 37:40.392
This was my decision.
I asked her to come.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.331
Okay.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.371
Maryellen, what...?

37:58.644 --> 38:00.346
One day

38:00.379 --> 38:03.515
you picked up a
little paint brush

38:03.549 --> 38:07.853
and you painted a watercolor
Christmas card for me.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.657
Big trees in Central Park...

38:11.690 --> 38:13.992
the buildings behind them.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.395
( softly chuckles )

38:16.428 --> 38:19.297
I remember it like yesterday.

38:21.433 --> 38:25.103
I fell in love
with you that day,

38:25.136 --> 38:30.041
and I love you now.

38:30.075 --> 38:33.912
and I will love you
till the day I die.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.617
And by the grace of God,

38:38.650 --> 38:41.553
I will live long enough
to see our girls

38:41.587 --> 38:46.458
grow up and find
their way in life.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.634
I forgive you...

38:59.170 --> 39:01.473
for what you did.

39:03.642 --> 39:08.380
But I cannot forgive you
if you let our children

39:08.414 --> 39:13.485
and your friends
and their families be destroyed.

39:15.020 --> 39:18.590
A trial will drag
all of us through the mud.

39:21.727 --> 39:27.399
I'm asking you, Andy,
to be a man

39:27.433 --> 39:30.636
and admit what
you've done.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.949
I'm so sorry.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.956
I'm sorry I...

39:50.989 --> 39:53.124
I didn't tell you
the truth about me.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.595
I'm sorry

39:56.628 --> 39:58.697
for what I did to you.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.002
I know.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.145
He wanted me to leave my family.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.682
I... I couldn't.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.151
I couldn't...

40:23.522 --> 40:25.023
admit I'm gay.

40:29.127 --> 40:33.599
We argued and I...

40:33.632 --> 40:36.134
I got angry--
I got so angry...

40:38.036 --> 40:39.805
and I killed him.

40:44.510 --> 40:45.944
NOVAK:
Man One.

40:45.977 --> 40:49.014
Seven-and-a-half to 15.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.750
He allocutes and only the plea
and the sentence

40:51.783 --> 40:52.951
go on the record.

40:52.984 --> 40:56.054
We seal the
rest forever.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.790
We'll forget about
the Disciplinary Committee.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.161
Andy...?

41:15.173 --> 41:18.243
( sighs deeply )

41:18.276 --> 41:20.512
Done.
