firstly, I need you
to give me your honest opinion

Congratulations.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.458
- Thank you.
- So, what are your plans?

11:00.494 --> 11:02.527
There's plenty of time
to talk about that.

decide to retire?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.951

11:26.987 --> 11:28.953

11:28.989 --> 11:30.955
She didn't want me here alone.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.558
- But I thought you loved it.
- I do!

11:33.593 --> 11:36.995

without her, and... well,

11:37.030 --> 11:40.498

11:58.051 --> 12:01.186

- You what?!

12:01.221 --> 12:03.121
You were always the one

12:03.156 --> 12:04.956
that said we shouldn't
sell out, that we'd

12:04.991 --> 12:07.992
lose our integrity. Dad, I'm
sure there are other options.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.528
Leanne!

12:10.564 --> 12:12.864
Sell the winery to Leanne,
not just some random company!

12:12.899 --> 12:14.866
We don't have to sell, but...

12:14.901 --> 12:16.634

Bear claw? I know it's not
popcorn and chocolate, but...

23:33.713 --> 23:35.646
it's a close second.
- What are you

23:35.681 --> 23:37.982
really doing here?
- I knew you were

23:38.017 --> 23:39.517
an early riser,
so I thought I'd join you.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.752
No, I mean
what are you doing <i> here.</i>

23:41.788 --> 23:44.655
Do you... do you
realize that this winery

23:44.690 --> 23:46.857
has been in my family
for 60 years?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.659
Do you have any idea
what this means to us,

23:48.694 --> 23:51.662
or is this just another deal
you have to close?

23:51.697 --> 23:54.665
Don't judge me so quickly!

23:54.700 --> 23:56.667
I might surprise you.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.702
Really? Then surprise me.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.671
OK. How about this?

24:00.706 --> 24:02.673
See that tall tree over there?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.642
That's an Oregon white oak.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.011
Right next to it,
that's a western white pine.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.679
Great for Christmas trees.

stayed in the country.

all the time.

about high-end wines, all right?

- Yeah, that's shocking.
- But I know a good story

24:28.601 --> 24:31.702

I'm really good at my job.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.205

as being good at your job.

while driving around.</i>

You're in for a treat.

47:21.406 --> 47:24.240
This is the perfect bite.

47:28.580 --> 47:30.079
Mm!

47:30.114 --> 47:32.415
What do you think?

47:33.918 --> 47:36.252
That it's delicious.

47:38.957 --> 47:40.890
Who are you?

47:40.925 --> 47:44.060
What do you mean?

47:44.095 --> 47:46.195

with your...

47:46.231 --> 47:49.265
your city swagger
and your car salesman ways

47:49.300 --> 47:52.101
and then... and then
you do all this.

47:52.136 --> 47:54.770
I can't figure you out.

47:57.308 --> 47:59.508
Why don't we stop talking
about business? All right?

47:59.544 --> 48:03.079
I just, I never get
a chance to relax.

48:03.114 --> 48:05.381
You know what?
You're right. Neither do I.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.784
(sighing)

48:08.820 --> 48:11.120
This little picnic would
be delicious with a...

48:11.155 --> 48:13.256
a bottle of our cab franc.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.124
- Oh...
- Have you tried it?

48:15.159 --> 48:17.093
Yeah. It's good.

48:17.128 --> 48:19.462
"It's good"? "Good"?

48:19.497 --> 48:21.631
Yeah, it's really...
it's really good.

48:21.666 --> 48:24.200
It's... fruity.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.135
"Fruity"?

48:26.170 --> 48:28.471
I'm sorry.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.439
How do you...

48:30.475 --> 48:33.142
how do you actually work for a
wine company and not know wine?

48:33.177 --> 48:36.612
I focus on
the entire wine experience.

48:36.648 --> 48:38.915
- OK? Not just the taste.
- Mm-hmm. Right.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.783
For example, at Stratosphere,

48:40.818 --> 48:43.986
we're known for making
boxed wine cool again.

48:44.022 --> 48:47.757
Boxed wine was never cool.

48:47.792 --> 48:49.258
That's just...

48:49.294 --> 48:51.661
That's very funny.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.965
You might be
Truman's daughter...

48:56.000 --> 48:58.501
but...

48:58.536 --> 49:01.837
I think there's
a lot more to you.

49:03.942 --> 49:06.275
Who wouldn't wanna live here,

49:06.311 --> 49:08.577
honestly, and talk
about wine all day?

49:08.613 --> 49:10.947
I'm jealous.

49:10.982 --> 49:13.149
I grew up with crowded sidewalks

49:13.184 --> 49:16.118
and concrete parks.

49:16.154 --> 49:18.521
Yeah, but what about
your camping trips?

49:18.556 --> 49:21.857
Those stopped when I was 15,
after my dad died.

49:21.893 --> 49:24.360
I traded...

49:24.395 --> 49:26.462
life in as a good old boy

49:26.497 --> 49:28.998
to be a full-time city kid.

49:29.033 --> 49:31.000
Seth, I'm sorry. I didn't know

49:31.035 --> 49:32.935
about your dad.
- Oh, no. It made me

49:32.971 --> 49:35.004
who I am today.

49:35.039 --> 49:37.006
Now I just work as hard as I can

49:37.041 --> 49:40.042
to be as successful
as I can possibly be.

49:40.078 --> 49:43.212
Success can...

49:43.247 --> 49:45.047
can be protective,

49:45.083 --> 49:48.451
but is it really fulfilling?

49:50.088 --> 49:53.022
Well... what do you
think fulfilling is?

49:53.057 --> 49:54.724
Being passionate

49:54.759 --> 49:57.026
about what you create
and not selling out.

49:57.061 --> 49:59.228
Um...

49:59.263 --> 50:02.732
you know, I just never had a...

50:04.602 --> 50:07.203
...family business
to fall back on, I guess.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.138

50:09.173 --> 50:12.041
you know, just because my family
started this,

50:12.076 --> 50:15.044

had to work incredibly hard.

50:15.079 --> 50:18.314

the thing that people

50:24.455 --> 50:27.223

- I think--

53:44.689 --> 53:47.256
(Seth): Well, here's
a thought. For the launch

53:47.291 --> 53:49.725
of our new canned spritzer,
we would do "freefills."

53:49.760 --> 53:52.828

that we should do a cab,
a pinot noir for the red,

for the white--

54:10.147 --> 54:11.914

55:23.688 --> 55:25.688
took it upon himself to start
fixing things around the cabin

55:25.723 --> 55:28.691

Although, I was thinking
that maybe it's someone

55:50.881 --> 55:52.881
that's in town for the Festival,
'cause all the locals

55:52.917 --> 55:54.683

Um... In Need of Repairs.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:07.175
OK. So you and Handyman,

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:09.511
you're, uh... you're
exchanging notes?

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.513
Yes, but it's no big deal!
I just want to meet him so I

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:14.816
can say thank you for everything
he's done around the cabin.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.619
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I hope
he's getting a discount.

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:20.155

doesn't matter,

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:42.844
maybe he doesn't think he's
good enough, and he backed out.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.547
You know? Or...

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.717
maybe he's hiding
in plain sight.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.023

right there?

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.993

all that other stuff

I blocked Seth's car!

01:21:17.406 --> 01:21:21.075
Huh? You said "stall"!

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.410
Good job.

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:27.381
- Chloe?
- Hey, Handyman!

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:31.018
You forgot something.

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:34.755
I left it on purpose.

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:36.390
But... I thought

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.692
this contract was your purpose.

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:40.694
(sighing)

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:42.396
It was...

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:45.599
until I found something
more important than business.

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.769
You did?

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:53.274
(sighing)

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:55.776
You, Chloe.

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:57.912
Your passion

01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:59.580
is infectious.

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:01.382
You make me wanna
be a better person,

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.450
find something more fulfilling.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:06.453
I had more fun
being your Handyman

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:08.289
in your middle-of-nowhere
quiet cabin

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:10.824
than I ever did in the city.

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:14.395
Don't sell to Stratosphere...

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.965
or to anyone else,
for that matter. You should

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.467
run the winery. You know it
better than anybody else.

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:25.105
That's...

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:27.107
that's, of course, if you...

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:29.109
if you want to.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:31.111
That's one

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:33.113
of the things I want.

01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:35.282
So...

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:37.484
what's the other thing?

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.288
Well, maybe it's
a good question for Handyman.

01:22:42.992 --> 01:22:45.960
What do you think Handyman
would advise us to do right now?

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.833
This.

01:22:52.868 --> 01:22:55.169
