00:03.265 --> 00:04.515
<i>For Dallas Royce,</i>

00:04.533 --> 00:06.717
<i>spring cleaning meant</i>
<i>out with the old...</i>

00:08.253 --> 00:10.663
<i>And in with</i>
<i>the new crystal Joy Behar</i>

00:10.679 --> 00:12.597
<i>she had commissioned.</i>

00:14.199 --> 00:15.649
You know what, Joy Behar?

00:15.738 --> 00:18.230
You give me strength.
You truly do.

00:19.607 --> 00:21.727
Am I nervous
about the store opening?

00:23.375 --> 00:26.560
You do ask
the tough questions, Joy Behar.

00:26.578 --> 00:29.313
Yes. Yes, quite frankly, I am.

00:29.347 --> 00:31.997
I've never tackled
anything like this on my own,

00:32.083 --> 00:34.419
and unlike you, I don't have
a multicultural,

00:34.442 --> 00:37.065
cross-generational
female support system,

00:37.620 --> 00:40.278
although
once upon a pledge week,

00:40.419 --> 00:42.129
I did experience
such sisterhood.

00:44.213 --> 00:47.865
My gosh, girl.
That's a great idea.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.691
I should invite
my sorority sisters out

00:49.725 --> 00:51.108
for the store opening.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.851
Well, I suppose you're right.

00:53.884 --> 00:56.447
They could stay with us.
We've got plenty of room now.

00:57.649 --> 00:59.117
Slow down, Yakult.

00:59.151 --> 01:02.220
Let me get a head count before
we worry about the catering.

01:05.973 --> 01:08.044
You know, maybe I should crack
a window in here.

01:10.618 --> 01:12.300
Sorry, Tess! Sorry.

01:12.331 --> 01:14.682
I was buying groceries,
and I forgot my wallet.

01:14.722 --> 01:16.072
I had to run
all the way home before...

01:16.107 --> 01:17.591
What was the point
of me getting my license

01:17.625 --> 01:18.993
if I never get to drive?

01:19.027 --> 01:20.811
You get to drive
on the weekends.

01:20.845 --> 01:22.146
Besides, there's nothing wrong
with walking.

01:22.197 --> 01:24.782
It builds character...
And calf muscles.

01:24.816 --> 01:27.601
Well, mine are already
the size of soup cans.

01:27.635 --> 01:29.153
See?

01:29.187 --> 01:31.472
So why
couldn't I walk home tonight?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.873
Because it's dark out.

01:33.912 --> 01:36.274
You think it's safer for me
to sit alone

01:36.336 --> 01:38.746
outside
a dark, empty building?

01:39.649 --> 01:41.400
You need to loosen
your grip, George.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.902
In some countries,
I'm old enough to marry.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.997
In some countries,
I could trade you for rice.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.442
Hi, darlin'.
How was your day?

01:50.476 --> 01:51.743
Anything from daddy?

01:52.207 --> 01:53.458
Over there.

01:59.535 --> 02:01.145
A motorcycle jacket?

02:02.885 --> 02:04.550
You guys got divorced.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.390
He's gonna have to do a lot
better than a motorcycle jacket.

02:07.422 --> 02:09.639
Well, there's a motorcycle
in the garage that goes with it.

02:09.657 --> 02:11.758
Now I feel better.

02:11.793 --> 02:12.926
Speaking of feeling better,

02:12.960 --> 02:15.466
we're about to have
a house full of guests.

02:15.576 --> 02:17.981
All my sorority sisters are
coming out for the opening.

02:18.015 --> 02:19.649
We're gonna sack out here
right in the living room,

02:19.667 --> 02:21.992
like a bunch of teenagers.

02:22.687 --> 02:25.222
Just six sorority dream-sacks,
Carmen.

02:25.497 --> 02:27.245
One of my girls won't be able
to make it,

02:27.362 --> 02:29.535
on account of the fact
that I didn't invite her,

02:29.660 --> 02:32.024
on account of the fact
that she's a big ol' bitch.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.248
Who's a big ol' bitch, mom?

02:33.282 --> 02:35.083
You don't know her,
but you know her.

02:35.134 --> 02:37.533
She's a backstabbin',
boyfriend-grabbin',

02:37.596 --> 02:39.480
style-jackin',
bubble-gum-smackin',

02:39.527 --> 02:41.124
husband-havin'-heart-attackin'...

02:41.158 --> 02:41.921
What?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.449
Her husband had a heart attack.

02:46.023 --> 02:47.925
Tessa! Dinner!

02:52.586 --> 02:54.912
<i>Mad respect, mother bird.</i>

02:54.983 --> 02:57.184
<i>When your baby left the nest,</i>
<i>you didn't show up</i>

02:57.218 --> 02:59.184
<i>outside her school</i>
<i>in your Prius.</i>

02:59.238 --> 03:03.424
<i>You knew that it was time</i>
<i>for her to find her own worm.</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:07.928
What are you doing?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.880
Finding my own worm.

03:11.032 --> 03:12.850
I don't want you making
dinner for me.

03:12.884 --> 03:14.318
I'm not
a little kid anymore.

03:14.352 --> 03:15.652
I can take care of myself.

03:15.670 --> 03:16.920
Is this because
I picked you up late?

03:16.955 --> 03:18.372
In the city,
I got around by myself.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.387
There were buses
and subways.

03:20.418 --> 03:22.199
Well, in Chatswin...

03:22.270 --> 03:23.788
We have
to rely on each other

03:23.852 --> 03:25.219
a little more.

03:25.299 --> 03:26.500
I think it's nice.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.046
Well, I don't...
Think it's nice.

03:30.095 --> 03:32.479
I want my own car
so I can be independent.

03:32.497 --> 03:33.998
You wanna be independent?

03:34.049 --> 03:35.599
Well, independent people pay
for their own things,

03:35.634 --> 03:37.318
so why don't you save up
and buy yourself some wheels?

03:37.352 --> 03:38.148
Fine. I will.

03:38.173 --> 03:39.007
Get a job.

03:39.150 --> 03:40.533
I <i>will.</i>

03:43.445 --> 03:44.812
And clean your dish.

03:45.706 --> 03:48.078
I was going to.

03:48.113 --> 03:50.113
Good. There you go.

03:51.279 --> 03:52.077
There you go.

03:52.154 --> 03:53.338
You gonna dry it?

03:54.049 --> 03:57.359
That is what the rack
is for, you... dictator!

03:57.956 --> 04:00.175
A dictator would not
use American.

04:12.563 --> 04:13.791
You're not a dictator.

04:13.809 --> 04:16.543
You just force people to do
what you say.

04:17.051 --> 04:19.397
Look. Let her make
her own dinner. Who cares?

04:19.432 --> 04:20.565
Everything's a fight.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.233
Something going on
at school?

04:22.268 --> 04:24.145
No. I mean, I-I don't know.

04:24.254 --> 04:26.507
She... she doesn't seem to want
to talk to me about anything.

04:26.550 --> 04:28.156
So talk to her teachers.
I don't know.

04:28.190 --> 04:30.775
George, a teenage daughter
who doesn't want to deal

04:30.809 --> 04:31.910
with her dad...

04:32.280 --> 04:33.998
That's just part
of growing up.

04:34.243 --> 04:35.830
That's normal.

04:35.865 --> 04:37.315
Jenna-girl!

04:37.333 --> 04:40.201
What? You just called to say
you love daddy?

04:40.252 --> 04:42.203
Well, I love you, too.

04:42.254 --> 04:43.588
I am?

04:43.623 --> 04:45.668
Well, you're the greatest
daughter in the whole world.

04:46.659 --> 04:49.344
I'll talk
to you in the morning.

04:53.150 --> 04:54.849
Yeah, but that's
not normal.

04:55.235 --> 04:56.766
Honestly,
I think she's drunk.

04:57.569 --> 04:59.036
<i>Suddenly, it was all</i>
<i>very clear to me.</i>

04:59.242 --> 05:02.777
<i>I'd become lazy, spoiled.</i>
<i>Dad was right.</i>

05:02.858 --> 05:05.193
<i>Asking him to get me a car</i>
<i>was just another handout.</i>

05:05.227 --> 05:06.561
<i>I wasn't a Chatswin girl.</i>

05:06.612 --> 05:09.814
<i>I was a New Yorker,</i>
<i>and I could do it myself.</i>

05:09.848 --> 05:11.316
<i>I had all the motivation</i>
<i>I needed.</i>

05:15.868 --> 05:19.157
I said I had
all the motivation I needed!

05:31.590 --> 05:32.556
Dallas?

05:33.592 --> 05:35.308
My gosh!
That keeps happening.

05:35.482 --> 05:37.194
I've gotta watch
my wingspan.

05:37.228 --> 05:39.830
If I keep breaking things,
we won't open tomorrow.

05:39.848 --> 05:40.931
I'm here because of

05:40.965 --> 05:42.283
your "help wanted" sign
in the window.

05:42.626 --> 05:45.035
Do you like it?
It's $2,600,

05:45.070 --> 05:48.022
but it's an investment piece,
and you'd have it forever.

05:48.742 --> 05:51.008
No.

05:51.409 --> 05:54.161
I-I guess I misunderstood.
I thought you were hiring.

05:54.216 --> 05:56.790
I am. I just haven't gotten
around to putting up a sign yet.

05:56.830 --> 05:57.963
Do you have a resume?

05:58.583 --> 05:59.505
No.

05:59.631 --> 06:01.315
Any references?

06:01.734 --> 06:02.700
You?

06:04.639 --> 06:09.867
And... in what way are <i>you</i>
like a crystal?

06:10.649 --> 06:11.760
In no way.

06:13.163 --> 06:14.413
Hold on. Let me think.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.035
We both have hard exteriors

06:20.925 --> 06:23.863
and... inner light.

06:24.324 --> 06:26.858
"Not like a crystal."

06:26.897 --> 06:30.633
Wait. Look, I may not be
all that much like...

06:31.157 --> 06:33.852
a crystal,
but I need a job,

06:34.259 --> 06:35.926
and I promise
I will work really hard

06:35.961 --> 06:37.444
if you give me a chance.

06:38.019 --> 06:41.379
I want to be an independent,
self-sufficient woman...

06:42.681 --> 06:43.731
Like you.

06:45.556 --> 06:47.007
And you do have
to start somewhere.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.054
Right, Joy Behar?

06:48.309 --> 06:50.987
That doesn't look like
Joy Behar,

06:51.010 --> 06:54.740
and there's a really strong
chemical smell in here.

06:55.918 --> 06:57.836
<i>We agreed</i>
<i>on better ventilation.</i>

06:57.870 --> 07:00.388
<i>We agreed</i>
<i>on a semiformal store uniform,</i>

07:00.423 --> 07:03.558
<i>which Dallas would provide,</i>
<i>and most importantly,</i>

07:03.592 --> 07:05.727
<i>we agreed</i>
<i>on a generous hourly wage</i>

07:05.761 --> 07:08.413
<i>that meant I would be able</i>
<i>to afford some kind of used car</i>

07:08.447 --> 07:10.548
<i>in the not-too-distant future.</i>

07:11.221 --> 07:12.464
What's this?

07:12.476 --> 07:14.698
Your advance,
your signing bonus,

07:14.754 --> 07:17.025
and a little extra
for a moisture-rich mani.

07:17.143 --> 07:19.341
Those hands are gonna be
cradling delicate crystals

07:19.375 --> 07:20.959
on the regular.

07:21.249 --> 07:24.045
<i>Maybe I'd have some wheels</i>
<i>even sooner than I thought</i>

07:24.063 --> 07:26.760
<i>now that I'd taken matters</i>
<i>into my own hands.</i>

07:26.815 --> 07:28.999
Splurge on
the paraffin treatment.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.252
Get up <i>all</i>
in those little cracks.

07:31.671 --> 07:34.256
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

07:34.298 --> 07:37.000
My door is always open.
Except when it's closed.

07:37.407 --> 07:38.790
- Understood.
- When it's closed,

07:38.809 --> 07:40.553
I really do appreciate
a knock first.

07:40.582 --> 07:42.819
- Okay. Got it.
- I mean...

07:42.850 --> 07:44.914
Who knows what could be
going on in here?

07:44.948 --> 07:46.752
Yeah, that certainly
is none of my business.

07:46.775 --> 07:50.136
I actually wanted to talk
about my kid, not... you.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.748
Understood.
That's not uncommon.

07:51.787 --> 07:53.069
I wanted to check in,

07:53.155 --> 07:57.247
see how everything is going
socially, academically.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.328
Everything's great.
Why do you ask?

08:00.282 --> 08:02.899
We're still talking
about Tessa.

08:02.931 --> 08:06.901
She just seems
distant lately, prickly.

08:06.936 --> 08:09.201
So you're worried something else
may be going on?

08:09.994 --> 08:13.576
Drugs, hard drugs, sex,
sex to pay for the drugs,

08:14.030 --> 08:16.160
secondary health concerns
as a result of the two?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.914
No, no. N-none of that.

08:17.938 --> 08:19.289
I'm not worried about
any of that.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.766
Don't be, because I don't
think that's it.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.199
Look, if anything comes up,
just keep me in the loop.

08:23.316 --> 08:25.872
I'll also lean on Malik
for information.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.191
If there's one thing
everyone knows about him,

08:28.566 --> 08:29.959
it's that he's a snitch.

08:31.076 --> 08:33.513
Okay. Well, thanks.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.341
- And, George?
- Yeah.

08:35.443 --> 08:37.767
I'm glad to see you have
your antennae up.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.611
If there were anything
going on with Tessa,

08:40.707 --> 08:42.477
I'm pretty confident
you wouldn't miss it.

08:42.532 --> 08:44.883
Well...
Well, thanks.

08:44.938 --> 08:47.693
I appreciate you saying so.
What's this?

08:48.376 --> 08:49.212
That?

08:49.246 --> 08:51.330
That's the soul-crushing poem
Tessa wrote

08:51.364 --> 08:53.032
about the giant,
festering hole inside her

08:53.050 --> 08:55.098
caused by the absence
of her mother.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.045
That... that's not good.

09:09.638 --> 09:11.847
<i>I was still trying to figure</i>
<i>out a way to fly the Coop</i>

09:11.886 --> 09:13.937
<i>while Dallas was busy filling</i>
<i>her empty nest</i>

09:13.955 --> 09:16.323
<i>with some chicks</i>
<i>she hadn't seen in a while.</i>

09:16.374 --> 09:17.574
Cheep, cheep!

09:17.592 --> 09:18.709
Okay?!

09:20.473 --> 09:22.131
We still got it, y'all.
We still got it.

09:23.259 --> 09:24.759
Your husband is gonna lose
his mind

09:24.810 --> 09:26.962
with us making
all this noise down here.

09:27.022 --> 09:29.095
Well...
Actually...

09:30.716 --> 09:34.367
And when I found that great big
giant pair of panties, I knew.

09:34.734 --> 09:36.674
You said they were an M/L?

09:36.706 --> 09:37.756
An M/L.

09:38.758 --> 09:39.841
That's just not right.

09:40.336 --> 09:42.548
A dog is always lookin'
for a bone!

09:42.773 --> 09:44.324
Testify, teeny!

09:44.402 --> 09:45.937
And I'll tell you something else.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.391
I was not gonna grow
old with some dog,

09:48.392 --> 09:50.081
gettin' bit up on by fleas!

09:50.470 --> 09:52.143
But, Dallas, I would get so scared

09:52.159 --> 09:54.051
being all alone
in this big ol' house.

09:54.099 --> 09:54.982
Don't you?

09:55.016 --> 09:56.400
Maybe it just hasn't
hit me yet,

09:56.434 --> 09:59.386
or maybe I'm being
<i>extra</i> strong for Dalia.

09:59.421 --> 10:01.334
That's the
same way I felt...

10:04.224 --> 10:06.019
After my husband passed.

10:10.052 --> 10:13.350
Hello, Dallas.
Room for an uninvited guest?

10:13.368 --> 10:16.687
I think I'll just help myself
to one of these cake pops.

10:17.365 --> 10:20.089
Hello, Tulsa. Cheep, cheep.

10:20.824 --> 10:22.175
Zebra?

10:23.344 --> 10:26.095
Well, I always pictured you
more as a snake.

10:26.130 --> 10:27.196
I don't want to bicker.

10:27.230 --> 10:30.116
My heart can't take
the stress.

10:30.150 --> 10:32.157
Grievin' as I've been, Dallas,

10:32.158 --> 10:34.493
I was surprised that you
didn't reach out to me.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.159
Well, maybe I was busy

10:37.195 --> 10:39.563
dealing with
my own situation, Tulsa.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.032
Still, being a divorcee

10:42.083 --> 10:44.951
isn't nearly as tragic
as being widowed.

10:44.986 --> 10:46.370
Wouldn't you girls agree?

10:46.796 --> 10:50.843
Ever since he's been gone,
I've just been so alone.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.161
Didn't your husband die,
like, five years ago?

10:53.205 --> 10:54.036
That's right!

10:54.117 --> 10:56.493
This weekend marks the fifth
anniversary of his death...

10:57.283 --> 11:00.483
Which is why I was surprised
that you chose to <i>exclude</i> me...

11:01.170 --> 11:03.271
In such a hurtful manner.

11:03.468 --> 11:05.614
Invitation must have got
lost in the mail.

11:05.685 --> 11:06.826
That's what I figured,

11:06.868 --> 11:09.369
which is why I decided
to surprise you.

11:11.102 --> 11:12.572
Surprise.

11:14.990 --> 11:16.924
Where'd you get all that?

11:16.942 --> 11:18.392
Is it meth money?

11:18.410 --> 11:20.328
It that why you're always
so pale?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.796
Can you guys keep a secret?

11:22.041 --> 11:23.324
I can.

11:23.335 --> 11:25.570
I got a job and an advance,

11:25.604 --> 11:28.039
and between this and the money
I have in the bank,

11:28.073 --> 11:29.490
I have enough to buy
an old scooter

11:29.525 --> 11:31.075
I found on Craigslist.

11:31.110 --> 11:33.494
My mom says that scooters
scramble your ovaries.

11:33.529 --> 11:35.847
They don't, but wouldn't you
be safer in a car?

11:36.084 --> 11:38.273
Yeah, sure,
if I had it like that.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.901
I'm not Dalia Royce.

11:40.364 --> 11:42.443
Look, kids like us have
to work for what we want.

11:42.474 --> 11:44.324
We're not just gonna get
stuff handed to us.

11:44.356 --> 11:46.423
My parents bought me a 328i.

11:47.011 --> 11:48.726
I have $35,000 in trust.

11:50.690 --> 11:52.029
Then it's just me.

11:52.729 --> 11:54.997
"Girl turns 3
on a store-bought cake,

11:55.032 --> 11:57.312
extinguished the candles
but not the hate"?

11:57.769 --> 12:00.734
Yeesh. Heavy stuff.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.805
Dark days, man.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.260
Do you feel like thai?

12:07.294 --> 12:09.062
No, I don't feel like thai,

12:09.376 --> 12:11.560
although I might do a <i>satay,</i>
if you're gonna order,

12:11.604 --> 12:13.706
but the point is,
Tessa is in pain,

12:13.895 --> 12:15.862
and I don't know how long
she's been keeping it from me.

12:15.892 --> 12:18.044
I tricked myself into thinking
it was about the car,

12:18.076 --> 12:19.326
but it's clearly this.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.616
Yeah.

12:22.444 --> 12:23.765
You know what?

12:24.124 --> 12:26.192
Why don't I just get
the order in?

12:26.226 --> 12:27.877
I just think
we'll both feel better

12:27.912 --> 12:28.828
with food on the way.

12:28.862 --> 12:29.829
I really want to hear
about this.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.848
Just give me
a-a couple of seconds.

12:32.283 --> 12:34.228
I'm right... I'm right with you.

12:34.919 --> 12:36.402
What am I supposed
to do now?

12:36.420 --> 12:39.106
A fat noodle? You like...
You like a fat noodle, George?

12:39.161 --> 12:41.596
Pork <i>lad na...</i>
That sound good? Hello.

12:41.647 --> 12:43.581
I wonder
if she wants to see her.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.189
I can't believe
we're in East Chatswin.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.176
We are slummin' it.

12:53.998 --> 12:56.825
East Chatswin doesn't look
like a slum to me.

12:58.106 --> 12:59.914
There's a garden gnome.

13:00.627 --> 13:02.333
Want a cig?

13:02.601 --> 13:04.235
Lisa, we don't smoke.

13:04.422 --> 13:06.003
When in Rome, am I right?

13:06.364 --> 13:07.230
No.

13:07.839 --> 13:09.941
Look. There it is.

13:10.130 --> 13:12.250
Anyone can advertise
on Craigslist.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.428
Is that right?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.895
Any crazy person
can post an ad,

13:15.954 --> 13:19.290
luring unsuspecting innocents
into their lair?

13:19.324 --> 13:20.758
This doesn't look
like a lair.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.793
Well, good lairs never do.

13:22.828 --> 13:24.011
On the outside,
they look regular.

13:24.046 --> 13:25.446
That's how a good lair
lures you.

13:25.481 --> 13:27.298
If it doesn't lure,
it's not a lair.

13:27.316 --> 13:29.639
Lisa, hold yourself
together.

13:29.757 --> 13:31.891
I'm gonna ring the bell now
and buy myself a scooter.

13:31.942 --> 13:34.110
Maybe there is no scooter.

13:34.145 --> 13:35.928
Maybe there's just
some psychopath inside

13:35.946 --> 13:37.897
waiting to make a suit out
of our skin.

13:38.501 --> 13:39.581
Or a sundress.

13:41.418 --> 13:42.422
Or a sundress.

13:42.826 --> 13:44.635
Ad said, "contact Doug."

13:44.994 --> 13:46.977
No psychopaths are named Doug.

13:47.821 --> 13:50.356
Doug's not home.
I'm Lucien.

13:50.555 --> 13:52.252
He asked me
to take care of you.

14:08.663 --> 14:11.784
Hello, Helen.
Thank you for meeting me.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.701
You're looking well.

14:14.736 --> 14:18.055
My goodness.
Look at all the wrinkles.

14:18.590 --> 14:19.906
Well, yeah, that...

14:19.940 --> 14:21.458
That's what happens
when you grow up.

14:21.509 --> 14:23.694
Here comes the high horse.

14:23.728 --> 14:24.661
I didn't come here
to fight.

14:24.696 --> 14:27.314
No? What did you
come here for?

14:27.348 --> 14:29.299
We have a couple
of a delicious soups today.

14:29.350 --> 14:31.427
There's
a country vegetable,

14:31.513 --> 14:33.863
a tomato basil,
a hearty lentil...

14:33.965 --> 14:35.007
Could you give us a minute?

14:35.036 --> 14:36.109
We're in the middle
of something,

14:36.144 --> 14:38.101
but I would do a small tomato,
if there's no cream.

14:42.487 --> 14:45.068
So... How is she?

14:45.342 --> 14:47.076
Your granddaughter?

14:47.462 --> 14:50.224
She's good. Yeah.
She's... she's great.

14:50.294 --> 14:52.767
Sole physical custody,
George.

14:52.801 --> 14:55.119
Quite a victory.

14:55.153 --> 14:56.604
It was really something
to see.

14:56.638 --> 14:57.958
I'm the bad guy?

14:58.323 --> 15:00.341
Alex falls apart.
I pick up the pieces,

15:00.375 --> 15:02.174
and somehow
I'm the bad guy?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.820
Aren't you even curious?

15:06.742 --> 15:07.898
Isn't she?

15:08.867 --> 15:11.169
Just tell me how to reach her.
I have a right to know.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.854
Her daughter has a right
to know.

15:13.885 --> 15:15.661
You made the decision,
George.

15:16.387 --> 15:18.051
Now you have to live
with it,

15:18.744 --> 15:20.020
just like we did.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.331
Right.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.201
You know what?
She's a great kid, Helen.

15:32.243 --> 15:35.345
She's smart and she's funny
and she's strong-willed.

15:35.380 --> 15:36.730
She's
really strong-willed...

15:39.167 --> 15:41.284
And she looks a lot
like Alex,

15:41.864 --> 15:42.716
so...

15:44.188 --> 15:46.073
Just tell her that for me.

15:48.292 --> 15:50.862
<i>There really was</i>
<i>no going home again,</i>

15:50.875 --> 15:53.084
<i>and Dallas was</i>
<i>discovering it, too.</i>

15:53.302 --> 15:56.324
Look, girls.
A must-have for Oscar season...

15:56.458 --> 15:57.908
The Billy Crystal.

15:57.926 --> 16:00.150
<i>Other sisterhoods</i>
<i>may have traveled...</i>

16:00.205 --> 16:02.613
Some people spend money
on just about anything.

16:02.647 --> 16:06.100
After all, Steven spent years
subsidizing you.

16:07.102 --> 16:08.686
<i>But this one didn't.</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:11.672
Dallas, have you seen Tessa?
She's not at home,

16:11.707 --> 16:13.124
and I really have
to talk to her.

16:13.158 --> 16:14.942
I thought she might have stopped
by here for the opening.

16:14.977 --> 16:17.657
Well, I was expecting her,
George, but she was a no-show.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.364
I must say, not the best way
to start a new job,

16:20.398 --> 16:22.489
and she had
such great references.

16:22.568 --> 16:24.552
Wait. She works here?

16:24.923 --> 16:27.104
And she didn't show up for work?
Okay, now I'm getting worried.

16:27.122 --> 16:29.039
Maybe Malik knows
where she is.

16:29.057 --> 16:29.957
Cheep!

16:31.477 --> 16:33.528
Okay. Malik.

16:33.562 --> 16:35.345
You have any idea
where Tessa is?

16:36.508 --> 16:38.651
She went to East Chatswin
to buy a scooter with Lisa.

16:38.745 --> 16:40.276
I-I told 'em not to do it.

16:40.763 --> 16:42.230
Don't... don't tell her
it was me.

16:42.264 --> 16:44.200
East Chatswin. Great.
I'm gonna go find her.

16:44.231 --> 16:45.418
I'll come with.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.885
You can't leave
all your friends.

16:49.638 --> 16:51.139
You know,
I'm starting to realize

16:51.173 --> 16:54.108
I only have one true friend
in this whole store,

16:54.461 --> 16:55.926
and he's on his way out.

16:55.999 --> 16:57.283
Come on.

17:00.736 --> 17:03.368
I can't believe he sold this
to you without any gas.

17:03.874 --> 17:05.040
I can't believe
you pushed me

17:05.108 --> 17:06.959
into a shirtless stranger's
living room.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.929
I'm sorry. I just happen to have
very strong survival instincts.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.128
So let me get this straight.

17:11.191 --> 17:13.739
You get a job and don't tell me,
and then you go to East Chatswin

17:13.747 --> 17:15.651
and buy a scooter
without my permission?

17:15.661 --> 17:17.577
You told me to do
both of those things.

17:17.655 --> 17:20.746
You said, "get a job."
You said, "buy some wheels."

17:20.778 --> 17:23.541
- I meant four wheels, not two.
- Didn't make that clear.

17:23.594 --> 17:25.694
You have to be real clear with
teenagers, George.

17:25.729 --> 17:27.246
Would you let me, Dallas,
handle this, please?

17:27.281 --> 17:28.631
I'm just trying
to help, daddy.

17:28.665 --> 17:30.639
Well, if you want to help,
you can drive Lisa home.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.444
Copy that.

17:39.984 --> 17:42.285
Let me guess. Malik?

17:45.690 --> 17:47.733
Well, thank you, Dallas.

17:47.889 --> 17:50.042
Thank you for inviting
your sisters all this way

17:50.061 --> 17:51.178
so you could ditch us

17:51.298 --> 17:53.061
to hang out
with your new boyfriend.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.716
He's not my boyfriend.

17:54.748 --> 17:56.416
Then maybe
I'll make a move.

17:57.468 --> 17:58.802
Word is, he's an architect,

17:58.836 --> 18:00.003
and I've been looking
for someone

18:00.037 --> 18:02.105
to lay hardwood downstairs.

18:02.413 --> 18:03.863
Well, that's a great idea,

18:03.950 --> 18:06.483
but first you're gonna need
to pull up that musty carpet.

18:06.616 --> 18:09.238
I've seen your downstairs,
and it needs some work.

18:09.397 --> 18:10.705
I thought she had tile
down there.

18:10.775 --> 18:12.691
Teeny,
close your tiny teeth.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.793
Honestly, Tulsa,
I'm not sure

18:14.861 --> 18:18.130
George is ready to take on
a project <i>that</i> size.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.849
Don't be silly.
I've actually lost weight.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.569
In fact,
I'm down to an S/M,

18:23.603 --> 18:27.256
when just months ago,
I was an M/L.

18:29.659 --> 18:31.977
If you're implying

18:31.995 --> 18:34.479
what I think
you're implying,

18:34.497 --> 18:36.782
no two people deserve
each other more.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.951
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:38.985 --> 18:41.987
I'll take my cue
from menopausal icon Joy Behar

18:42.005 --> 18:44.123
and storm out,
leaving my invited guests

18:44.157 --> 18:45.851
in the lurch.

18:55.055 --> 18:56.986
So are you
gonna let me keep it?

18:57.034 --> 18:58.850
You're so busy
operating independently,

18:58.874 --> 19:00.458
and you're not
thinking things through.

19:00.492 --> 19:01.102
Yes, I am.

19:01.103 --> 19:03.544
Tessa, you need a different
kind of license to drive this.

19:08.152 --> 19:09.283
Fill her up, please.

19:09.301 --> 19:11.252
I don't work here.

19:11.286 --> 19:12.953
Dalia?

19:12.971 --> 19:13.971
Does your mother know...

19:15.224 --> 19:17.958
Well, as always,
rules only apply to me.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.490
All right, look,

19:20.489 --> 19:21.966
I know what
you're really upset about.

19:22.956 --> 19:24.573
I, uh, I read your poem.

19:24.608 --> 19:25.841
What poem?

19:25.892 --> 19:27.822
The poem that
you wrote about your mother.

19:27.863 --> 19:28.656
What?

19:30.152 --> 19:33.155
George, don't read into that.

19:33.187 --> 19:34.260
That was just for a grade.

19:34.286 --> 19:35.786
Kinda hard not to read
into it.

19:35.992 --> 19:37.655
I mean, you never talk
about her.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.425
I-I don't know how
you feel.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.724
Look, I-I don't know what
you want me to say.

19:42.909 --> 19:46.111
I never think about her.
Ever.

19:46.403 --> 19:48.238
I don't know her.

19:49.249 --> 19:51.867
You can't really miss
somebody you don't know,

19:52.204 --> 19:53.860
and besides, George,

19:54.965 --> 19:57.349
don't take this
the wrong way, but...

19:57.777 --> 19:59.872
You're all the mom I need.

20:01.026 --> 20:02.059
All right.

20:02.132 --> 20:03.512
Now you're just trying
to butter me up

20:03.547 --> 20:04.713
so you can keep
the scooter.

20:04.764 --> 20:06.549
Did you just say
I could keep the scooter?

20:06.600 --> 20:07.766
'Cause that's what I heard.

20:08.514 --> 20:09.781
We'll see.

20:10.136 --> 20:11.136
"We'll see"?

20:11.170 --> 20:12.916
- You wanna go for a no?
- No.

20:17.727 --> 20:20.178
Dalia, I just got
a troubling phone call

20:20.197 --> 20:21.447
from George Altman.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.782
Said you took that motorcycle
your daddy gave you

20:23.817 --> 20:25.134
and took it out for a spin.

20:25.168 --> 20:26.605
He's lying.
He's a known liar.

20:26.738 --> 20:28.454
Well, I asked Carmen
to look into it,

20:28.488 --> 20:31.104
and she said the bike felt
warm to the touch.

20:31.178 --> 20:33.206
She's a known liar.
She steals from us.

20:33.852 --> 20:35.024
Listen here, girl.

20:35.471 --> 20:38.023
I know you're hurting.
I am, too,

20:38.331 --> 20:40.532
but these expensive gifts
from your daddy

20:40.550 --> 20:42.339
aren't gonna make
the pain go away.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.135
I know.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.046
That's why I want
a "hangover" monkey.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.381
A monkey?

20:48.472 --> 20:49.488
I want
one of those monkeys,

20:49.537 --> 20:51.097
"like in the movie
he hangover."

20:51.116 --> 20:53.965
Dalia, you can't just throw
"hangover" monkeys

20:53.993 --> 20:55.028
at the problem.

20:55.115 --> 20:58.835
Mom, those monkeys are
really cute.

20:59.152 --> 21:01.124
Those monkeys would
always be there for me.

21:01.508 --> 21:02.678
You listen up.

21:03.474 --> 21:05.702
I may not be a monkey,

21:06.493 --> 21:09.261
but I will always be here
for you.

21:09.371 --> 21:11.020
There are few people
in life

21:11.047 --> 21:13.866
who truly have your back,
Dalia Royce,

21:13.868 --> 21:16.231
and I hope you know
your mother is one of 'em.

21:24.526 --> 21:26.734
You swear
there was nothing to that poem?

21:26.763 --> 21:27.880
If there was,
you would tell me?

21:27.914 --> 21:30.212
I would tell you, George.
I promise.

21:30.275 --> 21:32.375
<i>Dad was gonna let me keep
that scooter.</i>

21:32.700 --> 21:35.583
<i>After all,
it was already in motion.</i>
