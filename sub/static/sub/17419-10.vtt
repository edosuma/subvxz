00:06.256 --> 00:08.234
Uh, so, uh... aah!

00:08.302 --> 00:09.868
You sure she's the last one?

00:09.936 --> 00:12.048
Eh, positive. I mean, you've struck out

00:12.168 --> 00:14.440
with every other woman on earth, man.

00:14.508 --> 00:17.313
You've tried every bar and
dating site in human society.

00:17.381 --> 00:19.281
If you can't make it
work out with Unkluk'tu,

00:19.349 --> 00:20.650
you're officially out of options.

00:20.717 --> 00:21.652
Okay.

(All laugh quietly)

00:44.325 --> 00:46.496
Crushing it, bro.

00:46.564 --> 00:47.465
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:47.532 --> 00:48.532
(Speaking in native language)

00:48.600 --> 00:49.967
Uh... What? What she say?

00:50.035 --> 00:51.002
Asked if you were a God.

00:51.070 --> 00:53.910
Pretty good sign, brother.

00:53.978 --> 00:56.048
(Speaking in Unkluk'tu's language)

00:57.918 --> 00:59.152
Yeah, totally cool.

00:59.221 --> 01:01.592
Um, so...

01:01.660 --> 01:03.562
Uh... Unkluk'tu,

01:03.629 --> 01:05.197
- do-do you like... ?

01:05.265 --> 01:07.233
Yes. Uh, do you...

01:07.301 --> 01:10.170
Like... music?

01:10.237 --> 01:13.506
(Speaking local language)

01:13.574 --> 01:14.709
(Laughing)

01:14.776 --> 01:16.045
Nice!

01:16.113 --> 01:17.849
Score, bro. Perfect questions.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.283
Nice!

01:19.351 --> 01:21.186
(Singing in native language)

01:25.827 --> 01:27.525
- I love this!
- Mike: Oh, good.

01:27.645 --> 01:29.197
(Speaking in native language)

01:29.266 --> 01:30.166
- Hey, time to go for it.
- Yeah?

01:30.234 --> 01:31.434
Yeah, yeah.

01:31.502 --> 01:33.903
(With British accent): Um... uh, milady,

01:33.971 --> 01:35.573
uh, would you

01:35.641 --> 01:39.077
uh, care to have dinner
with me while... okay.

01:39.145 --> 01:40.446
That was an accent, I don't know... yeah.

01:40.514 --> 01:41.782
- What are you doing?
- Do-do you... ?

01:41.849 --> 01:42.717
(Normal voice): Would you like to have

01:42.785 --> 01:44.219
dinner with me sometime?

01:44.287 --> 01:47.989
(Mike speaking local language)

01:50.688 --> 01:52.864
(Speaks native language)

01:52.932 --> 01:53.727
Uh, uh, well,

01:53.847 --> 01:56.613
she thinks you're very nice and...

01:56.733 --> 01:59.304
And loves that you're a powerful God.

01:59.371 --> 02:01.270
She really likes where
things are at with you guys.

02:01.338 --> 02:04.007
(Speaking native language)

02:04.075 --> 02:05.577
And doesn't want to jeopardize your...

02:05.578 --> 02:07.277
(Speaks native language)

02:07.278 --> 02:08.175
- Friendship.
- Friendship. No, I-I figured.

02:08.244 --> 02:09.310
Friendship.

02:09.377 --> 02:10.878
Uh, cool. No, I...

02:10.946 --> 02:12.548
I get that. I-I respect that.

02:12.615 --> 02:13.716
Friendship.

02:13.784 --> 02:16.453
(Both grunting, gasping)

02:16.521 --> 02:19.289
Okay, so...

02:19.356 --> 02:21.426
Guess that's it, then.

02:21.494 --> 02:23.225
That's it.

02:23.293 --> 02:25.124
Cool.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.049
It's hopeless.

03:01.117 --> 03:03.051
There's no one in the world for me.

03:03.119 --> 03:06.484
Some people are just meant to die alone.

03:06.551 --> 03:08.386
Totally, bro.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.856
(Cell phone buzzing)

03:11.923 --> 03:13.589
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

03:13.657 --> 03:16.359
Yeah, hello? Hello?

03:16.427 --> 03:17.728
Hi. Maggie!

03:17.796 --> 03:19.964
Hi! Oh, good, yeah, yeah.

03:20.031 --> 03:21.498
You... ?

03:21.565 --> 03:23.131
(Whispers): You want to get together.

03:23.199 --> 03:24.499
Yeah, yeah. That's great.

03:24.567 --> 03:25.600
That would be great.

03:25.668 --> 03:27.268
No, now-now-now...

03:27.336 --> 03:29.671
Now's a great time.

03:29.738 --> 03:31.773
Oh, this all makes sense now!

03:31.840 --> 03:33.575
This is why I didn't click

03:33.642 --> 03:35.710
with any of those other women.

03:35.777 --> 03:37.410
I think I was meant to be with Maggie.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.645
Everything happens for a reason.

03:38.713 --> 03:40.883
Oh! Oh, hi!

03:40.950 --> 03:43.250
- (Laughing)
- Josh!

03:43.318 --> 03:44.953
- You look great.
- Oh, no. You look great.

03:45.022 --> 03:46.489
- Wow. Aw!
- You look great.

03:46.557 --> 03:47.856
- I knew... yeah, this is...
- Thanks.

03:47.924 --> 03:50.322
- So nice.
- (Laughs)

03:51.924 --> 03:54.061
- I'm kind of nervous.
- Yeah, me, too.

03:54.129 --> 03:55.261
- Me too. I-I...
- Yeah.

03:55.329 --> 03:56.529
God, you're beautiful.

03:56.596 --> 03:58.697
Oh, thank you.

03:58.764 --> 04:01.136
- I'm just gonna come out and say...
- Come out and say it.

04:01.204 --> 04:03.573
(Both laughing)

04:03.641 --> 04:05.608
Finishing each other's
sentences, that is classic

04:05.676 --> 04:06.942
- Josh and Maggie.
- It is.

04:07.010 --> 04:08.778
It's... chocolate

04:08.846 --> 04:10.782
- and peanut butter and...
- (Laughs)

04:10.849 --> 04:13.350
- And-and Danny Glover and, uh, Mel Gibson.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.418 --> 04:15.585
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:15.653 --> 04:18.224
Okay, um... here it is:

04:19.892 --> 04:22.027
Graham and I are getting married.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.464
Wait, uh, what?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.737
(Laughs) Graham and I are getting married.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.834
Oh, my God.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.337
Yay. Oh...

04:31.404 --> 04:33.272
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.509
I know. That is so c...

04:36.576 --> 04:38.611
Holy shit.

04:42.818 --> 04:46.688
- You sure you're okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Oh.

04:46.756 --> 04:50.558
So, you-you guys must be,
like, busy, busy, busy.

04:50.626 --> 04:53.224
Are you, are you, uh, trying
to do, like, a big wedding

04:53.291 --> 04:56.226
or just kind of, like, a small,
justice of the peace thing

04:56.293 --> 04:57.693
like we were trying to do, or...

04:57.761 --> 04:58.994
Are you sure you're okay?

04:59.059 --> 05:00.158
Mm, yeah, I'm fine.

05:00.226 --> 05:01.593
Sir, an ambulance

05:01.660 --> 05:03.328
is on its way. Is there anything

05:03.395 --> 05:04.995
I can do for you in the meantime?

05:05.062 --> 05:08.732
- You, uh... you... your French onion soup...
- Yes?

05:08.800 --> 05:11.342
- Is it super oniony?
- No, not super oniony.

05:11.462 --> 05:12.804
All right, I'll take some of that, then.

05:12.872 --> 05:14.904
- Are you fine for water here?
- How's my, how's my...

05:14.971 --> 05:17.508
Is the French onion soup coming?

05:17.576 --> 05:19.867
Yes. Yes, it is, sir. Yes.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.076
- Great.
- Good news.

05:21.144 --> 05:22.678
Thank you. Thank you.

05:22.745 --> 05:24.913
So... um, so is your mom

05:24.981 --> 05:26.982
just becoming, like, a...

05:27.050 --> 05:28.817
A momzilla, or, you know,

05:28.885 --> 05:30.819
(siren wailing) Or are you
guys like, "no, hands off,

05:30.887 --> 05:33.121
we can do this our own self".

05:33.189 --> 05:35.557
We've actually hired a wedding planner.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.627
Wedding planner... ?

05:37.695 --> 05:39.127
- That's smart, right?
- Smart.

05:39.195 --> 05:41.328
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I just

05:41.395 --> 05:43.164
don't want to have all
the pressure on me to make

05:43.232 --> 05:44.801
all the decisions, 'cause
I'm not that good...

05:44.868 --> 05:46.769
- You know how it is.
- Oh, wedding planner, wed...

05:46.837 --> 05:48.203
So what's gonna be your guys'

05:48.271 --> 05:50.939
first song for your first dance?

05:51.007 --> 05:52.374
"Wonderwall."

05:52.442 --> 05:53.641
- Oasis.
- Oh, yeah.

05:53.709 --> 05:55.242
- That was our song, huh?
- I know!

05:55.309 --> 05:57.145
- But it's a cool song, right?
- That's a great song.

05:57.213 --> 05:59.116
Are you sure you're okay with this?

05:59.184 --> 06:02.251
- Oh, yeah, yes, congratulations.
- Okay.

06:02.319 --> 06:04.485
- Let me know where you guys get registered.
- Oh, I will.

06:04.605 --> 06:06.222
- Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

06:07.445 --> 06:09.513
I can't believe Maggie's marrying this guy.

06:09.581 --> 06:11.853
- Oh, Graham, that guy's great.
- What?!

06:11.973 --> 06:13.407
He's way better than you. (Chuckles)

06:13.527 --> 06:14.973
What the... what? Jesus, man.

06:15.093 --> 06:16.467
I'm sorry. Look...

06:16.732 --> 06:18.369
Any time you want to talk about anything,

06:18.489 --> 06:20.859
just know that I'm always there for... oh!

06:20.927 --> 06:22.430
Pills!

06:22.968 --> 06:25.534
Two minutes of sexual madness? How much?

06:25.602 --> 06:27.634
- $2.50. But be careful.
- (Gasps)

06:27.702 --> 06:30.616
Label says may cause irreparable
damage to the liver.

06:30.736 --> 06:33.209
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll take 'em.
- I can't believe... I just can't believe

06:33.276 --> 06:36.945
I-I bought her those
cheap, stupid carnations.

06:37.012 --> 06:38.413
Ho... ow!

06:38.481 --> 06:40.482
Ow! My balls are boiling.

06:40.550 --> 06:42.251
It's just, like, if I'd just gotten her

06:42.318 --> 06:43.950
an actually good birthday present.

06:44.018 --> 06:45.986
Put some thought into it, we
never would have had that fight,

06:46.054 --> 06:49.727
- and we'd still be together.
- I... it is what it is, buddy.

06:49.795 --> 06:51.631
It's not like you can go back in time.

06:51.699 --> 06:53.734
Holy shit.

06:53.802 --> 06:56.339
Two minutes of time travel madness?

06:56.408 --> 06:57.642
What do they do?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.410
They take you back in time.

06:59.478 --> 07:02.479
I took one once, saw some dinosaurs.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.948
- How much?
- $2.50.

07:05.016 --> 07:06.550
Be very careful.

07:06.618 --> 07:08.885
Label says may cause irreparable damage

07:08.953 --> 07:10.418
to the space-time continuum.

07:10.486 --> 07:12.052
Hachi Machi.

07:12.704 --> 07:13.885
Thank you.

07:24.108 --> 07:27.390
- What the... oh, my... aah, aah!
- Josh, it's me, from the future... listen, listen...

07:27.458 --> 07:29.391
don't buy Maggie these
cheap purple carnations.

07:29.459 --> 07:30.840
She'll think they're cheap and stupid.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.091
- (Screaming)
- Shut up.

07:32.158 --> 07:34.128
Good God, man, get ahold of yourself.

07:34.196 --> 07:35.765
- Buy her that necklace she wanted.
- (Screaming)

07:35.832 --> 07:38.800
Stop screaming. Trust me... !

07:40.705 --> 07:42.040
(Mike groaning)

07:42.107 --> 07:43.942
My liver really hurts.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.811
Jesus Christ.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.338
We told you not to take those.

07:48.849 --> 07:51.182
Oh, my g... Maggie.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.216
- What?
- Oh, my God.

07:53.284 --> 07:56.053
And the necklace... it-it worked.

07:56.121 --> 07:58.922
- What?
- Did... I... I-I love you, you...

07:58.990 --> 08:02.476
- I love you, yeah. Yeah.
- You... yeah. Oh, my God

08:02.596 --> 08:05.797
this ama... it worked. Okay,
we got... we got to... we got to go.

08:05.864 --> 08:08.799
- Why?
- We have to go make up for so much lost time.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.535
- (Laughs)
- This way.

08:10.602 --> 08:12.459
(Laughing)

08:12.579 --> 08:16.277
- Oh, oh, God.
- Oh!

08:16.344 --> 08:18.313
(Both gasping passionately)

08:18.381 --> 08:20.081
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

08:20.149 --> 08:22.381
- Mm.
- Mm.

08:22.449 --> 08:24.518
Mm-hmm.

08:24.586 --> 08:27.721
- Ooh. Ooh.
- (Chuckles)

08:27.788 --> 08:30.020
Do you want to get dinner? My treat.

08:30.088 --> 08:31.909
- Sure.
- Yeah?

08:32.614 --> 08:33.791
We haven't had Sushi in a while...

08:33.857 --> 08:36.524
(Gasps) Sushi. Yeah.

08:36.592 --> 08:40.173
Sushi's good. Check the old balance.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.562
Okay. Yeah, okay,

08:42.630 --> 08:44.664
Su-Sushi... always an option.

08:44.731 --> 08:45.732
- We could also...
- Mm-hmm?

08:45.799 --> 08:48.236
Do that little falafel place.

08:48.304 --> 08:50.306
You know, the one that's
also a dry cleaner's?

08:50.374 --> 08:51.486
You know?

08:52.042 --> 08:53.207
Yeah.

08:53.275 --> 08:55.074
Cool, yeah.

08:55.142 --> 08:57.111
We can do that.

08:57.179 --> 08:58.846
You know what? No.

09:03.616 --> 09:06.251
Who do you think God prays to?

09:07.652 --> 09:09.785
An even bigger God?

09:10.335 --> 09:12.019
(Exhales)

09:12.086 --> 09:14.288
I... I think-I think...

09:14.356 --> 09:16.749
I think I'm gonna major in philosophy.

09:17.507 --> 09:19.426
Sweet plan, bro.

09:19.494 --> 09:21.227
- Josh.
- Aah!

09:21.295 --> 09:23.296
- Don't major in philosophy.
- Aah!

09:23.364 --> 09:24.699
Major in economics.

09:24.766 --> 09:26.034
Your life will be much better.

09:26.102 --> 09:28.038
Trust me!

09:31.208 --> 09:34.646
Yay. Thank you. Mmm...

09:38.153 --> 09:39.387
- Hello, sweetie.
- Sweetie.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.522
How was work today?

09:41.590 --> 09:43.924
Just did economics stuff
at my economics job.

09:43.991 --> 09:46.192
(Giggles)

09:46.260 --> 09:48.577
What? What... what are you...
What are you looking at?

09:48.947 --> 09:50.727
Oh. Just those guys.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.364
- Cool beards, huh?
- You like those.

09:52.432 --> 09:53.662
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they're cool.

09:53.730 --> 09:55.431
They're cool they are cool.

09:55.498 --> 09:59.367
They, um... Say, what's-what's over, uh...

09:59.434 --> 10:02.150
- What?
- Don't... that-that thing over there,

10:02.270 --> 10:03.838
that's just marvelous. That's...

10:04.772 --> 10:06.710
What are you talking about?

10:06.778 --> 10:08.578
What you doing, Tom?

10:08.931 --> 10:12.240
Oh, just shaving my whiskers, Joshie.

10:12.504 --> 10:15.385
When I grow up, I'm shaving every day.

10:15.453 --> 10:17.033
Neato.

10:22.724 --> 10:24.792
Josh! Don't shave every day.

10:24.860 --> 10:26.362
- (Screaming)
- Grow distinctive facial hair.

10:26.430 --> 10:28.530
Distinctive facial hair!

10:28.597 --> 10:30.464
Trust me!

10:30.531 --> 10:32.833
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

10:32.901 --> 10:34.334
Josh, you may now kiss Maggie.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.266
Yeah!

10:38.842 --> 10:40.436
I'm so happy.

10:40.504 --> 10:41.803
Me, too.

10:42.067 --> 10:44.277
Everything is finally perfect,

10:44.345 --> 10:47.677
and I didn't even screw up
the space-time continuum.

10:47.745 --> 10:50.811
(Church bells ringing)

10:50.879 --> 10:52.446
Woman (Over PA): This
is your daily reminder

10:52.513 --> 10:54.613
that Trackanon plans to kill all.

10:54.681 --> 10:56.550
Thank you, and praise Trackanon.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.760
Oh, hey, man.

11:06.827 --> 11:07.906
Just wanted to say thank you

11:08.026 --> 11:09.967
for those terrific time-travel pills.

11:10.034 --> 11:11.969
Uh, let me update you on my life.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.670
I'm now married to Maggie.

11:13.737 --> 11:15.938
And absolutely everything's perfect, so...

11:18.518 --> 11:19.774
yeah.

11:19.841 --> 11:22.108
D-do you have any new video game magazines?

11:22.176 --> 11:23.511
I don't know. Check the rack.

11:23.581 --> 11:24.514
Well, yep.

11:28.322 --> 11:31.226
(Sighing): Okay...

11:31.293 --> 11:33.430
Female voice: This is the one-hour warning

11:33.498 --> 11:35.167
(siren wailing) For the city-wide curfew.

11:35.234 --> 11:37.203
Please return to your homes now.

11:37.271 --> 11:38.238
(Man grunts)

11:38.305 --> 11:41.244
Ugh, I can't take it anymore.

11:41.311 --> 11:43.177
Go back to space, you crummy aliens!

11:43.245 --> 11:44.510
(Shouts)

11:47.811 --> 11:50.146
Maggie: <i> Hey, I thought you</i>
<i>stopped reading that magazine.</i>

11:50.213 --> 11:51.777
R-really?

11:51.845 --> 11:53.177
Yeah.

11:53.245 --> 11:54.912
You said it was a dumb magazine

11:54.979 --> 11:56.580
for kids who play too many video games.

11:56.648 --> 11:57.880
I-I did?

11:57.948 --> 11:59.414
(Gasps) Oh, our favorite show is on.

11:59.481 --> 12:00.513
Ooh...

12:00.581 --> 12:02.283
Is it, uh,<i> Carnivàle?</i>

12:02.351 --> 12:04.153
No,<i> Meet the Press.</i>

12:04.221 --> 12:05.856
<i>Meet... </i>

12:05.924 --> 12:07.525
Man: On your 401k.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.661
Is it too late to climb on board?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.030
Man 2: Not at all, I think

12:10.098 --> 12:11.833
what we've seen is just
the tip of the iceberg.

12:11.901 --> 12:13.802
Woman: I would not want
to be on the sideline.

12:13.869 --> 12:15.169
There's lots of room for growth.

12:15.237 --> 12:16.572
Man 1: Glad to hear that,

12:16.640 --> 12:18.608
which brings us to the financial markets...

12:18.676 --> 12:20.043
Female voice: This is your daily reminder

12:20.111 --> 12:22.477
that Trackanon plans to kill all.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.410
Thank you, and praise Trackanon.

12:25.980 --> 12:26.913
Mike?

12:26.981 --> 12:29.015
Josh Greenberg.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.582
Get out of town.

12:30.649 --> 12:31.550
Bring it in, dude.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.886
What's happening, baby?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.255
- Uh...
- Good to see you, man.

12:34.323 --> 12:35.691
Ooh, sorry about that.

12:35.759 --> 12:37.761
- It's just...
- Wh-what's all, uh... ?

12:37.829 --> 12:41.201
Oh, dude, I'm working as
a sex slave for Trackanon.

12:41.269 --> 12:43.667
Great gig... dental, mental health,

12:43.735 --> 12:45.436
Jewish holidays off.

12:45.504 --> 12:46.970
It's killer stuff, man.

12:47.038 --> 12:48.439
Female voice: Two-minute warning.

12:48.507 --> 12:49.741
Ooh, hey, could you help
me stretch real quick?

12:49.809 --> 12:51.043
Yeah, o-okay.

12:51.111 --> 12:52.744
- Just put the lid down.
- All right.

12:52.812 --> 12:55.347
Okay, get on in there, brother.

12:55.415 --> 12:57.249
- Jesus, I'm just, uh...
- Go for it.

12:57.316 --> 12:59.150
Just, just push, man.

12:59.217 --> 13:00.783
Yeah, just like that.

13:00.851 --> 13:01.816
Oh, just like that!

13:01.884 --> 13:04.452
Ah, hail Trackanon.

13:04.519 --> 13:07.158
Whoo! This feels good, man.

13:07.225 --> 13:08.822
Just the two of us hanging out again,

13:08.890 --> 13:09.889
I mean, it's been, like, years.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.090
Really?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.091
Yeah, but, dude, it's not your fault.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.658
I totally get it... you're too busy.

13:14.726 --> 13:16.659
Here, stretch my cheeks.

13:16.727 --> 13:19.660
Uh, married to Maggie, hello.

13:19.728 --> 13:22.163
Trading bonds at Goldman Trackanon.

13:22.231 --> 13:23.664
It's beautiful, man.

13:23.732 --> 13:25.435
We're both living the
lives we always wanted.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.933
(Horn blows)

13:27.053 --> 13:28.590
Oh, sex horn, dude... gotta run.

13:33.342 --> 13:34.909
Josh: <i>Does anyone here know Liz?</i>

13:34.977 --> 13:38.045
Man 2: Code green! Code
green! Tunnel breach!

13:38.113 --> 13:40.816
General Greenberg, we found this intruder.

13:40.884 --> 13:42.184
You want to kill him?

13:42.251 --> 13:43.884
Leave him to me.

13:43.952 --> 13:45.286
Josh, what are you doing here?

13:45.354 --> 13:47.193
I thought you and Maggie
were loyal to Trackanon.

13:47.313 --> 13:48.293
What?

13:48.360 --> 13:49.562
Doesn't matter... it's so good to see you.

13:49.630 --> 13:50.999
I can finally give you your wedding gift.

13:51.119 --> 13:52.129
You got golf clubs.

13:52.196 --> 13:53.395
Yeah, the pro at your country club said

13:53.463 --> 13:54.796
that they were your favorite brand.

13:54.864 --> 13:56.198
(Alarm wails) Man: Tunnel breach!

13:56.266 --> 13:57.301
(Guns fire) Alien in the tunnels!

13:57.368 --> 13:58.097
Country club?!

13:58.217 --> 13:59.837
Code green! Code green!

13:59.904 --> 14:01.337
Let's go!

14:01.405 --> 14:02.637
Get down! Go!

14:06.708 --> 14:08.796
Stay down, Josh!

14:08.916 --> 14:10.679
Get off my planet!

14:12.283 --> 14:13.383
(Yells victoriously)

14:14.086 --> 14:14.897
(Alarm stops)

14:15.531 --> 14:17.949
I mean, golf clubs. Are you s... ?

14:18.069 --> 14:19.188
Like, what is this?

14:19.256 --> 14:21.156
What, what is this?

14:21.224 --> 14:24.528
I look like d'Artagnan, and
I love <i> Meet the Press?</i>

14:24.872 --> 14:26.597
Have I really changed that much?

14:27.057 --> 14:28.931
No. I mean, you still have

14:28.999 --> 14:32.978
your distinctive... Josh... facial hair.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.953
Hey, listen, the important
thing is, you're happy.

14:36.073 --> 14:37.775
(Alarm sounding, gunfire)

14:50.368 --> 14:52.355
What do you mean you're not happy?

14:52.422 --> 14:54.758
What does that mean? What?
You're not acting like yourself!

14:54.826 --> 14:56.854
I know. That's the
point I'm trying to make.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.928
This isn't who I am.

14:59.995 --> 15:01.699
Josh, you're scaring me.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.367
No, Maggie. It's okay, all right?

15:03.435 --> 15:04.866
I can... I can fix this. Watch.

15:04.934 --> 15:06.699
- I can make things better, okay?
- How?

15:06.767 --> 15:08.101
I'll make... I'm make everything okay.

15:08.169 --> 15:10.016
I'll make everything...

15:11.197 --> 15:12.975
- What?!
- Oh, no.

15:15.078 --> 15:16.413
- Oh, no.
- What?!

15:16.481 --> 15:17.984
Oh, no.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.986
(Sighs)

15:27.069 --> 15:27.857
I'm stuck here.

15:27.925 --> 15:28.758
(Cries, sniffles)

15:31.898 --> 15:33.078
Josh: Uh...

15:33.554 --> 15:34.896
Okay.

15:34.964 --> 15:37.507
- (Distant alarm wailing, gunfire)
- Maggie, we just...

15:37.627 --> 15:39.469
We shouldn't be married.

15:39.536 --> 15:42.172
- We need to get divorced.
- We can't!

15:42.240 --> 15:45.666
No. Okay, I know. I know, it's... no fun.

15:45.786 --> 15:47.199
No one wants to do it, but it's...

15:47.319 --> 15:48.449
Oh, you idiot!

15:48.517 --> 15:50.418
Trackanon's Catholic, okay?

15:50.486 --> 15:52.253
Divorce is punishable by death!

15:52.321 --> 15:54.421
We're married for the rest of your life!

15:54.489 --> 15:56.256
Hail, Trackanon.

15:56.324 --> 15:57.924
Female voice: (Beep) Thank you.

15:57.992 --> 16:00.028
- Do it.
- Do... do what?

16:00.095 --> 16:01.062
Hail, Trackanon.

16:03.532 --> 16:04.966
Hail, Trackanon.

16:05.034 --> 16:06.742
Female voice: (Beep) Thank you.

16:07.370 --> 16:09.206
(Alarm and gunfire continue)

16:09.273 --> 16:11.541
(Maggie crying)

16:12.910 --> 16:14.377
(Sighs)

16:14.445 --> 16:17.079
(Maggie sniffling)

16:20.544 --> 16:22.450
Yeah, sorry, dude... nobody gets in

16:22.518 --> 16:24.619
to see Trackanon except his official sluts.

16:24.686 --> 16:27.656
Right. Well, maybe... I can join his harem.

16:27.723 --> 16:30.126
I don't know, dude.

16:30.193 --> 16:31.829
How wide can you open your mouth?

16:31.896 --> 16:33.831
Well, uh...

16:33.898 --> 16:37.467
Whoa! Welcome aboard, stud!

16:37.535 --> 16:39.734
Here. Suit up and get greasy.

16:56.136 --> 16:58.502
Your Serene Majesty,
this is my friend Josh.

16:58.569 --> 17:00.838
- He's super cool.
- Yeah. Hi. Thanks.

17:01.269 --> 17:02.275
Thanks for having me.

17:02.767 --> 17:05.621
(Grumbles)

17:06.079 --> 17:06.961
A lot of it...

17:07.080 --> 17:09.790
- It's-it's my metabolism.
- He's eating a lot more.

17:09.858 --> 17:12.194
Oh, yeah. No, no, I-I'm eating way more.

17:17.096 --> 17:20.006
(Lively dance music plays)

17:34.358 --> 17:36.491
(Mike grunting, gasping)

17:36.559 --> 17:38.760
- Oh, my God.

17:38.827 --> 17:40.828
Oh, that's awful.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.634

Neato.

Okay, sign right here.

Officially divorced.

Thank you.

19:10.029 --> 19:11.463
- Here are your rings.
- Oh. Okay.

You've completely ruined my life.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.770
- Maggie, wait...
- (Sighs)

19:16.837 --> 19:20.574
There's... someone I want you to meet.

19:24.969 --> 19:28.855
Uh, so, Maggie, uh, this is Graham.

19:28.923 --> 19:30.043
Graham, this is Maggie.

That's the-the girl I
was telling you about.

Hey.

19:33.642 --> 19:34.558
Hi.

19:36.162 --> 19:40.144
So, Josh tells me you're...
You're into golf.

19:40.849 --> 19:42.534
Yeah, I am...

19:42.654 --> 19:44.606
- Yeah? Cool.
- ... Actually.

19:44.674 --> 19:46.410
- Yeah. What's your handicap?
- My handicap?

19:46.478 --> 19:48.045
- Yeah.
- I'm like a... Like a ten index.

19:48.113 --> 19:49.177

19:49.297 --> 19:50.748
(Josh sputters)

19:51.292 --> 19:52.950
How do you feel, Josh?

19:53.018 --> 19:54.685
Uh, honestly?

19:54.753 --> 19:56.232

Like I'm finally over
her... For real this time.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.855
(Inhales deeply)

20:01.922 --> 20:03.236
Do you guys want to go out?

20:03.658 --> 20:05.509
I'm not really ready to date, bro.

20:05.629 --> 20:07.793
You don't just get over
someone like Trackanon.

20:07.861 --> 20:09.226
First person I'd ever been faithful to.

20:09.826 --> 20:11.261
Wasn't a person.

20:11.328 --> 20:12.919
Liz: And I... I gotta head to work.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.541
Think I've got a shot at making partner,

20:14.560 --> 20:16.092
now that all the partners are dead.

20:17.829 --> 20:19.705
No, you know what? Wait,
wait, wait, guys, guys...

20:19.711 --> 20:21.555
No. No, no, no, listen...

20:21.586 --> 20:23.621
We are young. We're single.

20:24.604 --> 20:25.940
Trackanon is dead.

20:26.060 --> 20:27.791
I'm sorry, but he is.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.372
And it's Saturday night!

20:29.492 --> 20:30.891
- I...
- Listen,

20:31.205 --> 20:32.958
what's the worst that
could possibly happen?

20:33.078 --> 20:34.502
- I... I'm just...
- I...

20:34.502 --> 20:35.906
Come on!

20:36.292 --> 20:38.358
You pussies!

20:38.478 --> 20:40.159
- (laughs)
- Huh?

20:40.175 --> 20:41.055
You pussy!

20:41.091 --> 20:42.005
- That's funny.
- Right?

20:42.023 --> 20:43.220
You are what you eat!

20:43.259 --> 20:44.611
- Hey, that a boy.
- (laughs)

20:44.630 --> 20:45.971
- I'm not touching you.
- Okay.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.574
No, it's-it's... I don't
actually talk like that.

20:47.578 --> 20:48.885
- Uh-huh. Oh, sure.
- You know how I talk.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.926
Anyway, the point is...

20:49.999 --> 20:51.352
- What's the point?
- ... the night is young!

20:51.383 --> 20:52.665
- Oh, my God.
- Follow the jiggling...

20:52.669 --> 20:53.670
♪ Ting-aling-aling! ♪

20:53.697 --> 20:55.396
- I can't say no to that guy.
- That is unbelievable.

20:55.423 --> 20:56.541
- ♪ Tinga-linga-ling. ♪
- Did you know he could do that?

20:56.572 --> 20:58.270
- Did you teach him this?
- Mike: I do now.

20:58.283 --> 21:00.165
- Where did you get those moves?
- Oh, shit. Oh, no.

21:00.188 --> 21:01.318
- Uh-oh.
- (Mike singing)

21:01.397 --> 21:03.240
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.165
This is fun...
