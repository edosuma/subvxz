03:05.771 --> 03:07.239
Field two?

03:07.372 --> 03:10.474
Yeah,
before the rains hit.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.078
That's all she'll hold.

03:48.447 --> 03:50.048
Auger's stuck!

04:02.861 --> 04:04.796
That's it. Got 'em.

You take this load in.
I'll finish up.

Okay, see you tomorrow.

05:33.118 --> 05:34.820
Bet you're making a killing.

05:36.088 --> 05:37.956
That's a lot of money.

05:38.490 --> 05:40.292
Take a look at that.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.928
- Huh? Huh?
- What?

06:02.680 --> 06:04.349
Yeah!

06:13.024 --> 06:14.226
So?

06:16.461 --> 06:17.896
What do you think?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.464
What did that set you back?

06:19.598 --> 06:22.434
It's an investment.
Don't talk to me about money.

06:23.301 --> 06:26.670
- Missy, wanna go for a ride? Hey!
- Yeah!

06:26.805 --> 06:28.874
No. You know what, sweetheart?
We have to go in.

06:29.007 --> 06:30.575
Aw! No fair.

06:30.708 --> 06:32.777
Come on,
let's wash up for dinner.

06:36.414 --> 06:37.849
I told you.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.252
Come here.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.990
We know you love carrots.

06:45.123 --> 06:47.959
There you go.
Another carrot?

06:48.093 --> 06:51.863
- Yeah!
- Okay, here they are. Carrots and peas. There you go.

06:51.997 --> 06:54.199
Mary, can you go
wash your hands, please?

06:54.332 --> 06:55.967
But I'm not using them.
I'm using...

06:56.101 --> 06:57.903
Hey, Ron. What you got?

06:58.036 --> 07:01.206
Package for Mr. Percy Schmeiser.
You have to sign.

07:01.739 --> 07:03.108
What is it?

07:03.241 --> 07:06.044
I deliver the mail, Percy.
I don't write it.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.047
Dad?

07:09.181 --> 07:10.348
Thanks.

07:12.384 --> 07:14.452
Dad?

07:14.586 --> 07:18.356
Percy Schmeiser
to speak with, uh,

07:19.524 --> 07:21.126
Rick Aarons.

07:22.127 --> 07:23.727
- Did you wash your hands?
- No.

07:23.862 --> 07:25.797
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you? Let me see them.

07:25.931 --> 07:27.832
Right in between there
and there, you gotta...

07:27.966 --> 07:30.001
- Those are my veins.
- You've gotta go back.

07:30.135 --> 07:32.270
I've received
this statement of claim.

07:33.004 --> 07:35.574
Look, there's gotta be
a mistake.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.642
I got my own seeds.

07:37.776 --> 07:39.710
Grandpa!

07:39.844 --> 07:41.179
Your granddad's hiding.

07:41.313 --> 07:44.049
What?
You're calling me a thief.

07:44.916 --> 07:46.717
- You want me to cease what?
- Who's that?

07:46.851 --> 07:50.288
Farming? No, no. That... Really?

07:50.422 --> 07:55.660
No stranger's gonna come in my
field and take samples of my plants.

07:55.794 --> 07:57.362
What do you mean?

07:58.630 --> 08:00.532
Court order?

08:00.665 --> 08:02.367
- How'd you do that?
- Dad...

08:02.500 --> 08:06.938
Fine, but I'll be there
when they come by.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.342
Thank you.

09:29.454 --> 09:32.957
Daddy told me your great-grandma
sewed seeds into her dresses.

09:33.091 --> 09:34.025
That's right.

09:34.159 --> 09:35.527
My great-great-grandma

09:35.660 --> 09:37.729
sewed 'em into her dress
to keep 'em hidden.

09:38.463 --> 09:40.432
Coming over
from the old country,

09:40.565 --> 09:43.301
seeds was the most
valuable thing they had.

09:44.836 --> 09:46.604
Who are those men, Grandpa?

10:00.118 --> 10:02.153
Mr. and Mrs. Schmeiser,
welcome.

10:02.287 --> 10:04.089
I'm Jackson Weaver.

10:04.222 --> 10:05.523
Um...

10:05.657 --> 10:07.592
Yeah, a lot of partners
for a small firm.

10:07.726 --> 10:09.961
Most of those guys are down
in Florida playing golf.

10:10.095 --> 10:11.396
Come on in.

10:13.665 --> 10:16.167
So, how can I help?

10:16.935 --> 10:20.872
This can't wait.
We got a... This.

10:21.005 --> 10:26.111
They got a court injunction to
take samples from our fields.

10:26.244 --> 10:28.480
Trying to fleece me
outta 19 grand.

10:31.616 --> 10:33.184
Oh, yeah.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.487
These are not small claims court
kind of guys.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.022
- I never bought their seed.
- They're not saying you did.

10:38.156 --> 10:41.192
They're saying you grew it
without a license.

10:41.326 --> 10:44.496
Okay. Um, well, first things
first, I'll call them

10:44.629 --> 10:47.565
and we'll set up a time
for them to come get samples.

10:47.699 --> 10:49.501
They've come already.

10:52.437 --> 10:56.508
Yeah, this is a PI firm. They're...
they're mostly ex-cops.

10:57.742 --> 10:59.244
Oh.

11:01.246 --> 11:03.381
Look, if there's even
a little contamination,

11:03.515 --> 11:05.885
I strongly suggest
that you settle.

11:06.017 --> 11:07.652
Maybe offer them five,
see if you can

11:07.787 --> 11:09.320
- get them down to ten.
- Thousand?

11:09.454 --> 11:12.123
That's your
300-bucks-an-hour advice?

11:12.257 --> 11:13.558
Offer 'em a small fortune

11:13.691 --> 11:15.493
'cause they send me
a nasty letter?

11:15.627 --> 11:17.629
- Must be nice to be a lawyer.
- Percy...

11:17.763 --> 11:19.964
You're entitled to contest
your claim in court,

11:20.098 --> 11:22.734
but you do need to understand
that if you lose,

11:22.868 --> 11:25.270
on top of all the damages,
you're gonna have to pay

11:25.403 --> 11:28.039
all of their legal bills,
which, I can assure you,

11:28.173 --> 11:30.876
will be a hell of a lot
more than $10,000.

11:43.354 --> 11:46.291
Feels like you're angling
for a fight, Percy.

12:04.777 --> 12:06.678
- Field number seven?
- Yup.

12:18.958 --> 12:20.658
What the heck does he want?

12:20.793 --> 12:24.496
I told ya this wasn't just
gonna go away, Percy.

12:31.536 --> 12:32.570
Morning.

12:32.704 --> 12:34.005
Mr. Jackson.

12:34.138 --> 12:38.409
Mr. Weaver. Jackson Weaver.
Page A-5.

12:40.178 --> 12:44.516
I did a little research. Monsanto's
claiming the canola you grew in '97

12:44.649 --> 12:48.319
contained a technology in the
seed's gene that they created.

12:48.453 --> 12:50.756
It's a pesticide-resistant gene.

12:50.890 --> 12:54.125
It seems that,
even after your crop is already growing,

12:54.259 --> 12:56.862
you can spray the entire field
with their herbicide.

12:56.996 --> 12:58.429
It's called Roundup.

12:58.563 --> 13:01.000
It kills all the weeds,
but leaves your crop.

13:01.132 --> 13:03.234
They spray the crop
and we eat it.

13:03.368 --> 13:07.238
If I could just talk
to Monsanto, clear this up.

13:08.506 --> 13:11.242
I think it's beyond talking,
Mr. Schmeiser.

13:11.376 --> 13:14.880
Monsanto's tests showed
substantial contamination

13:15.014 --> 13:17.615
of their gene in your crop.

13:18.283 --> 13:19.684
That's a load of bull!

13:21.052 --> 13:24.489
Look! These are my seeds, okay?

13:25.490 --> 13:29.727
These are Monsanto GM seeds
I got from my neighbor Karl.

13:29.862 --> 13:34.900
How hard would it be
to swap these for these, huh?

13:35.034 --> 13:37.068
Sir, accusing them
of conspiracy

13:37.201 --> 13:38.670
is only gonna make us
seem more guilty.

13:38.804 --> 13:41.840
My advice, once again,
you should settle.

13:41.974 --> 13:44.676
Give 'em ten K
just like that!

13:44.810 --> 13:46.711
And all of these
have to go to the company.

13:46.845 --> 13:47.880
How's that?

13:48.013 --> 13:49.714
They have the gene in them,

13:49.848 --> 13:53.819
so Monsanto will say that all
of this is their property.

13:56.755 --> 13:58.656
Guess we're going to court then.

14:02.027 --> 14:03.528
Will Percy have to testify?

14:03.661 --> 14:06.065
Oh, definitely.
Is that gonna be a problem?

14:06.197 --> 14:08.266
You ready for this, Percy?

14:08.399 --> 14:11.770
Getting his driver's license photo
is too much limelight for him.

14:14.974 --> 14:16.574
I'll do it if I need to.

14:16.708 --> 14:19.644
Well, we're gonna rehearse
exactly what you're gonna say.

14:19.778 --> 14:22.313
And if you really want to go for
this, we're gonna need witnesses.

14:22.447 --> 14:26.184
That's out. I can't trouble other people.
It's my problem.

14:26.317 --> 14:28.787
But we need someone
to back up your story.

14:28.921 --> 14:32.024
How 'bout Alton?
He works for Percy sometimes.

14:32.156 --> 14:33.558
Good luck with that.

14:34.392 --> 14:35.961
All right, well,
then someone else.

14:36.095 --> 14:39.130
It's a key part of building your case.
Talk to him.

14:39.263 --> 14:43.102
Here, turkey.
Here, here.

14:55.146 --> 14:56.547
Grandma, let's go!

14:56.681 --> 14:57.715
Okay.

15:01.285 --> 15:04.322
Read about you
in the paper there, Perce.

15:04.455 --> 15:07.793
Save room for the hot dog
eating contest there, Karl.

15:09.028 --> 15:11.262
Hello.

15:23.675 --> 15:27.211
Okay, Grandpa. We gotta go.

15:28.212 --> 15:29.580
All right, this is it,

15:29.714 --> 15:31.349
the moment
we've all been waiting for.

15:31.482 --> 15:35.854
The 63rd annual
Bruno Zucchini race! Step up!

15:39.925 --> 15:41.492
On your mark,

15:41.626 --> 15:42.727
get set,

15:42.861 --> 15:44.529
go!

15:44.662 --> 15:47.465
Look at Canola Conquest go!

15:47.598 --> 15:50.601
And the winner is
Mary Schmeiser!

15:53.571 --> 15:56.441
We did it, Grandpa! We won!

16:03.481 --> 16:07.218
Damn, that's good.
You ladies made these?

16:07.351 --> 16:09.420
Best pie maker
in all of Saskatchewan.

16:10.421 --> 16:12.690
"Bruno Women's Institute."
Good cause.

16:12.825 --> 16:14.325
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.461
- You folks from around here?
- No, ma'am.

16:16.594 --> 16:18.764
We are on our way to the
Rockies for our honeymoon.

16:18.897 --> 16:20.866
Yeah, and who might you be,
best pie maker?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.234
I'm Louise.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.804
This is Brenda,
best pie maker's partner.

16:25.938 --> 16:28.841
- Well, I'm Jane and this be my new husband John.
- Oh.

16:28.974 --> 16:32.010
Mr. Schmeiser, careful with
those pies. Worth a fortune.

16:32.978 --> 16:35.047
Oh, Percy. Thank you.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.316
Jane and her hubby John?

16:39.051 --> 16:41.619
The Does? Nice.

16:41.754 --> 16:44.388
You gonna talk to Karl
or am I?

16:46.158 --> 16:47.425
I'll do it.

16:47.558 --> 16:50.796
You're gonna need
some fries with that.

16:56.701 --> 16:58.203
Hey, Karl.

16:58.369 --> 17:00.072
You sure got people talking.

17:00.205 --> 17:01.874
What they saying?

17:02.007 --> 17:05.743
That you stole Monsanto's seed
because it's better than yours.

17:05.878 --> 17:07.913
You know
I'm not a thief, right?

17:08.947 --> 17:12.918
But I could do with a bit
of help here at my hearing.

17:14.153 --> 17:16.155
Percy Schmeiser
asking for help?

17:16.287 --> 17:17.856
I only need you
to go on record,

17:17.990 --> 17:20.558
tell 'em you've been
my neighbor all these years,

17:20.691 --> 17:23.528
that I always save my seed.

17:24.595 --> 17:27.632
Percy... I can't.

17:27.766 --> 17:29.634
I do business
with these guys.

17:29.768 --> 17:32.805
I can't afford to get
on the wrong side of them.

17:35.040 --> 17:39.044
That's all right, Karl.
You know, I'll figure something out.

17:41.046 --> 17:42.413
Yeah.

17:45.017 --> 17:47.886
Mr. Schmeiser,
have you ever purchased Monsanto canola?

17:48.020 --> 17:50.388
How long have you been
a seed saver?

17:50.521 --> 17:52.124
Have you signed
a contract with Monsanto?

17:52.257 --> 17:54.325
In 1998, were you trying to grow

17:54.458 --> 17:55.961
an herbicide-resistant crop?

17:56.094 --> 17:58.030
Finally, Mr. Schmeiser,
most importantly,

17:58.163 --> 18:02.000
have you ever knowingly planted
Monsanto's GM canola?

18:02.868 --> 18:04.402
Well, have you?

18:04.535 --> 18:06.671
You've got a hostile
witness there, Weaver.

18:08.472 --> 18:10.275
My client was unable
to make rehearsal.

18:10.408 --> 18:11.977
Did you get his retainer?

18:14.612 --> 18:16.547
I think he's good for it.

18:16.681 --> 18:18.851
I'd push for a settlement
if I were you.

18:19.584 --> 18:21.586
And you need
to project more.

18:24.589 --> 18:25.858
What do you think?

19:01.026 --> 19:02.160
Wait.

19:03.962 --> 19:06.131
- Rick Aarons.
- Jackson Weaver. Nice to meet you.

19:06.265 --> 19:09.400
Just wanted to say,
I think it's very brave what you're doing.

19:09.533 --> 19:12.771
Really, very courageous of you.
Good luck.

19:13.537 --> 19:15.406
Order. All rise.

19:24.582 --> 19:27.052
This court is open.
Please be seated.

19:30.421 --> 19:31.823
Mr. Aarons.

19:33.792 --> 19:37.763
My Lord, this is an action
for patent infringement.

19:38.764 --> 19:41.465
The Monsanto Company
owns a patent to a gene

19:41.599 --> 19:43.902
which, when incorporated
into canola,

19:44.036 --> 19:48.639
renders it tolerant to a powerful
herbicide called Roundup.

19:48.774 --> 19:51.310
A farmer can kill
all the weeds in the field

19:51.442 --> 19:53.946
and yet have the crop survive.

19:54.079 --> 19:57.416
Through tests conducted on the
canola leaf and seed samples

19:57.548 --> 19:59.818
taken from
Mr. Schmeiser's field,

19:59.952 --> 20:03.755
it was determined by no less than
three independent laboratories

20:03.889 --> 20:07.692
that the seed, indeed,
is property of Monsanto.

20:18.904 --> 20:20.471
Mr. Schmeiser?

20:22.074 --> 20:25.844
Mr. Schmeiser?
Hi. I'm Rebecca Salcau.

20:25.978 --> 20:27.745
- I'm from the People for...
- I don't have any...

20:27.879 --> 20:30.315
- Excuse me?
- ...smokes.

20:30.449 --> 20:32.985
Oh, I'm not... I'm
not bumming a smoke from you.

20:33.118 --> 20:35.253
I'm here to help you
with your case.

20:35.387 --> 20:37.189
- Help how?
- Oh...

20:37.322 --> 20:39.291
Percy, you're gonna catch
a cold out here.

20:39.424 --> 20:40.759
I have to get back in.
Excuse me.

20:40.892 --> 20:43.929
I'm... I'm actually
coming in too.

20:45.163 --> 20:48.233
Mrs. Schmeiser?
Are you Mrs. Schmeiser?

20:48.367 --> 20:49.468
Yes.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.569
Hi. I'm Rebecca.

20:51.702 --> 20:52.670
Louise Schmeiser.

20:52.804 --> 20:54.638
Rebecca Salcau from the PEP,

20:54.773 --> 20:56.341
the People for
Environmental Protection.

20:56.475 --> 20:59.211
- I was trying to tell your...
- He's not usually like this.

20:59.344 --> 21:02.447
- Mr. Schmeiser?
- There you are. Been looking all over for you.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.715
- You're up next. Are you ready?
- It's a lotta steps.

21:04.850 --> 21:06.918
- Catch your breath.
- Mr. Weaver, hi. I'm Rebecca Salcau

21:07.052 --> 21:08.820
from the People for
Environmental Protection.

21:08.954 --> 21:10.489
I've left several messages
at your office.

21:10.621 --> 21:13.392
What... Whatever you're talking
about, it's not for me.

21:13.524 --> 21:16.194
You don't understand.
This is a precedent setting case.

21:16.328 --> 21:19.031
- You could change history.
- He's about to testify. Just give him room...

21:19.164 --> 21:22.666
In order to do that,
we need to show how this GM tech

21:22.801 --> 21:24.668
is bad for
all independent farmers.

21:24.803 --> 21:26.805
It does not matter
whether Mr. Schmeiser

21:26.938 --> 21:29.341
intentionally used
Monsanto seeds or not.

21:29.474 --> 21:30.942
- The hell it doesn't.
- No.

21:31.076 --> 21:32.844
Ms. Salcau,
I appreciate your passion.

21:32.978 --> 21:35.047
- I know what I'm talking about.
- That's very clear,

21:35.180 --> 21:37.715
- but you're standing in the men's room.
- It's for men.

21:39.683 --> 21:41.253
I'll wait in the hall.

21:43.288 --> 21:44.688
Where did you find her?

21:44.823 --> 21:46.124
She found me.

21:47.492 --> 21:51.063
Mr. Schmeiser, over the years,
how have your plants been

21:51.196 --> 21:53.131
in terms of
incidence of diseases?

21:53.999 --> 21:57.169
Good. I haven't lost a crop
in 50 years.

21:58.136 --> 22:00.338
And to what would you
attribute your success?

22:02.240 --> 22:03.975
I'm a seed saver.

22:04.109 --> 22:05.676
And... And what does
that mean?

22:05.811 --> 22:07.813
Well, every summer
I study my crops.

22:07.946 --> 22:10.816
I get to know them.
I study how they react

22:10.949 --> 22:13.852
to too much heat, drought,
too much rain.

22:13.985 --> 22:16.388
I try to find the plants
that are the most virile

22:16.521 --> 22:19.391
and I save those seeds
for next year's planting.

22:19.524 --> 22:23.995
It's how my father taught me to
farm and his father taught him.

22:24.129 --> 22:25.931
Mr. Schmeiser,
have you ever bought

22:26.064 --> 22:28.467
- bootleg Roundup Ready canola from anyone?
- No.

22:28.599 --> 22:31.937
Have you ever attended one of
Monsanto's informational meetings?

22:32.070 --> 22:33.105
No.

22:33.238 --> 22:34.906
Have you ever signed
a contract with Monsanto

22:35.040 --> 22:38.243
- to grow their Roundup Ready canola?
- I have not.

22:38.376 --> 22:40.979
And when you grew
your 1998 canola crop,

22:41.113 --> 22:45.584
did you intend to grow a
Roundup herbicide-tolerant crop?

22:45.716 --> 22:47.085
I did not.

22:47.953 --> 22:49.921
Thank you. That is all.

22:53.391 --> 22:54.860
Mr. Schmeiser,

22:56.061 --> 22:59.598
in 1998, you say
you planted field number two

22:59.730 --> 23:02.134
with seed from your '97 crop.

23:02.267 --> 23:03.535
That's correct.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.270
And, in June of '97,

23:05.403 --> 23:08.907
<i>you hand-sprayed Roundup
around power poles.</i>

23:09.040 --> 23:11.343
<i>And the ditches.
I always do.</i>

23:11.943 --> 23:13.979
And ten days later,

23:14.112 --> 23:19.317
you noticed that about 60%
or so of the crop didn't die?

23:19.451 --> 23:20.552
That's correct.

23:20.684 --> 23:21.853
<i>Were you surprised?</i>

23:21.987 --> 23:23.321
<i>I was, yeah.</i>

23:23.455 --> 23:24.890
<i>I hadn't seen that before.</i>

23:25.023 --> 23:27.125
<i>Did you tell anyone about this?</i>

23:27.259 --> 23:31.463
No. I figured I hadn't
had the chemical mixed right.

23:31.596 --> 23:36.034
So, you experimented by spraying
another four acres of the field?

23:36.434 --> 23:37.369
Yes.

23:37.502 --> 23:38.904
And noticed that, again,

23:39.037 --> 23:40.839
about 60% of the canola
survived?

23:40.972 --> 23:42.407
About that, yeah.

23:42.541 --> 23:45.743
- <i>At that point, were you concerned?</i>
- <i>Not really.</i>

23:45.877 --> 23:48.013
<i>It was thickest by the road,
so I figured...</i>

23:48.813 --> 23:51.116
<i>it had blown off
passing farm equipment.</i>

23:51.249 --> 23:53.318
Did you consider it
to be contaminated?

23:57.455 --> 23:59.291
I did. Yeah, I guess so.

24:00.625 --> 24:04.796
In August, you and Mr. Alton Kelly
swathed and combined the field,

24:04.930 --> 24:07.332
including the areas
you sprayed.

24:10.202 --> 24:12.237
- That's correct.
- You've just told us

24:12.370 --> 24:14.673
that you considered it
to be contaminated

24:14.806 --> 24:18.076
and yet, strangely,
you decided that the yield from this field

24:18.210 --> 24:21.580
should be kept as seed
for the following year.

24:21.712 --> 24:24.916
I did. But, see,
they were healthy plants

24:25.050 --> 24:26.985
and I figured they wouldn't
harm my seed stock.

24:27.118 --> 24:30.021
That's what I do,
I save strong plants

24:30.155 --> 24:32.490
to get the best seeds
over the years.

24:34.526 --> 24:37.762
I didn't know anything
about any patent.

24:41.633 --> 24:43.734
And they were on my land.

24:46.571 --> 24:48.673
- Hey, Schmeisers.
- Hey, Dana.

24:48.807 --> 24:51.243
Where'd they get hold
of all that stuff?

24:51.376 --> 24:54.713
They have, like, 100 lawyers
on the clock 24/7, so...

24:54.846 --> 24:56.114
Are you following me?

24:56.982 --> 24:58.550
I'm the one
that's already here.

24:58.683 --> 25:01.653
Look, I reckon my wife's gonna
invite you to join our table.

25:01.786 --> 25:04.789
I'd appreciate it if you'd,
you know, make an excuse.

25:04.923 --> 25:07.993
Rebecca, why don't you
come and join us?

25:08.126 --> 25:10.996
Thank you, Louise.
I would love that.

25:11.129 --> 25:12.831
Yeah, come and join us.

25:15.433 --> 25:17.502
Uh, wax beans?

25:17.636 --> 25:21.840
Um, that's not gonna work.
Has everyone else ordered?

25:21.973 --> 25:25.377
Yeah? Uh, how do you
cook your fries?

25:25.510 --> 25:27.479
We fry them.

25:27.612 --> 25:29.014
Right, but in what?

25:29.447 --> 25:30.448
The fryer.

25:30.582 --> 25:32.684
You know what?
It is fine.

25:32.817 --> 25:37.188
I will just have a green salad,
please, with oil and vinegar.

25:37.322 --> 25:39.257
Thank you.

25:40.659 --> 25:42.727
I feel like I'm in Fargo.

25:42.861 --> 25:44.896
- I've been to Fargo.
- Oh.

25:47.132 --> 25:50.268
So, Percy, you haven't lost
a crop in 50 years?

25:50.402 --> 25:52.203
- Correct.
- That's incredible.

25:52.337 --> 25:54.739
How long has your family
been farming?

25:54.873 --> 25:56.941
- Generations.
- Hmm.

25:57.075 --> 26:00.780
I became a teacher instead of
following in my father's footsteps.

26:00.912 --> 26:03.615
Not just mine.
Your grandfather's,

26:03.748 --> 26:05.283
your great-great-grandfather's...

26:05.417 --> 26:07.285
All the way back to
the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

26:07.419 --> 26:09.888
- You think it's a joke.
- No, sir.

26:10.021 --> 26:13.625
Two hundred years ago,
we were serfs back in Europe.

26:14.492 --> 26:16.695
We risked everything
to come to this country.

26:16.828 --> 26:17.763
You know why?

26:17.896 --> 26:19.799
To escape the same crap

26:19.931 --> 26:22.200
this damn corporation's
trying to pull on us right now!

26:22.334 --> 26:25.036
Exactly! Would you just say
that to a journalist or two?

26:25.170 --> 26:26.772
- No way!
- Why not?

26:26.905 --> 26:29.274
What you're doing is heroic.
You should be recognized.

26:29.407 --> 26:33.411
It's a private matter
between me and Monsanto.

26:33.545 --> 26:36.381
Try the veal.
I'm here all week.

26:37.682 --> 26:40.085
See ya around.

26:42.354 --> 26:45.290
You try to fight them
on your own, you will lose.

26:46.958 --> 26:48.660
We can help pay
your legal fees.

26:48.794 --> 26:50.261
How?

26:50.395 --> 26:53.164
Percy tells his story.
We collect donations.

26:53.298 --> 26:55.100
I'm no charity case.

26:55.233 --> 26:57.535
It's not charity.
There are thousands of people

26:57.669 --> 26:59.003
who want to support you.

26:59.137 --> 27:01.106
I'm no poster boy, neither.

27:05.043 --> 27:06.878
- Take care.
- Come on, Ma.

27:07.011 --> 27:08.980
Bye! Get home safe.

27:33.304 --> 27:37.509
<i>Now, let's talk about that
stormy day in field number seven.</i>

27:37.642 --> 27:40.912
We had heavy winds
and there was a lot of canola

27:41.045 --> 27:43.381
blowing in
from a neighbor's fields.

27:44.983 --> 27:46.317
And then what happened?

27:46.451 --> 27:51.122
I picked it up with the combine,
just like the rest.

27:52.157 --> 27:56.461
So, plants from
the other farmer's fields

27:56.594 --> 28:00.265
may have accounted
for some of the seeds

28:00.398 --> 28:03.101
that Mr. Schmeiser saved
for his crop that year?

28:03.234 --> 28:05.303
That's correct.

28:05.437 --> 28:10.008
Now, the whole point
of Roundup Ready canola,

28:10.141 --> 28:14.245
as I understand it,
is that when you grow it,

28:14.379 --> 28:17.682
you can spray all of your crops
with Roundup.

28:17.817 --> 28:19.250
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

28:20.118 --> 28:22.822
Has Mr. Schmeiser
ever asked you

28:22.954 --> 28:26.558
to spray a field of growing
canola plants with Roundup?

28:26.691 --> 28:28.326
No. He did not.

28:30.295 --> 28:32.430
Thank you.

28:32.564 --> 28:34.332
Okay.

28:38.703 --> 28:40.638
Perce.

28:41.406 --> 28:43.341
Did you interview
any farmers

28:43.475 --> 28:45.710
who were growing
Roundup Ready canola

28:45.845 --> 28:50.248
as to whether they sold
Mr. Schmeiser any GMO canola?

28:50.381 --> 28:51.784
I believe I did, yes.

28:51.917 --> 28:53.251
Now, do you recall
an interview

28:53.384 --> 28:55.386
with a Mr. Karl Steiger?

28:56.154 --> 28:58.189
It was in a room
at the Frontier Hotel.

28:58.323 --> 29:02.193
And did you turn the heat up
on Mr. Steiger

29:02.327 --> 29:04.262
during this interview,
intimidate him a little?

29:04.395 --> 29:06.731
Did you imply to him
that you had proof

29:06.866 --> 29:09.434
that he sold Roundup Ready
canola to Mr. Schmeiser?

29:09.567 --> 29:11.569
I believe the words
I used were,

29:11.703 --> 29:15.139
"I know you sold Roundup Ready
canola to Mr. Schmeiser."

29:16.007 --> 29:18.811
But you were bluffing
at that point?

29:19.677 --> 29:21.679
I didn't have
any factual evidence.

29:23.014 --> 29:24.616
I see. Thank you.

29:28.419 --> 29:33.725
So, in 1997, you grew a crop
of Roundup Ready canola?

29:33.859 --> 29:37.228
I had a crop,
you betcha, yes.

29:37.362 --> 29:41.967
And where did you buy the Roundup
Ready canola that you seeded in '97?

29:42.100 --> 29:44.369
At the pool elevator in Bruno.

29:44.502 --> 29:46.471
<i>How was it packaged?</i>

29:46.604 --> 29:47.739
<i>In bags.</i>

29:48.706 --> 29:50.675
Did any of the bags ever break?

29:50.809 --> 29:54.013
Yeah, when I was loading
the bags into the truck,

29:54.145 --> 29:55.814
<i>one of 'em spilled open.</i>

29:56.414 --> 29:57.917
Any seeds leak out?

29:58.049 --> 29:59.417
Well, they sure could have.

29:59.551 --> 30:01.319
<i>They're making the bags
out of paper now.</i>

30:01.452 --> 30:05.490
What route do you take back to your
farm, Mr. Steiger?

30:06.825 --> 30:08.660
It was the Bruno grid.

30:09.594 --> 30:10.796
The Bruno grid.

30:10.930 --> 30:14.867
Now, is the Bruno grid
in this area? Am I right?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.401
Right... Right by Mr....

30:16.534 --> 30:19.404
Yeah, it goes
right by Percy's fields.

30:19.537 --> 30:22.340
Runs right past
Percy's fields.

30:23.608 --> 30:24.810
Thank you, sir.

30:30.214 --> 30:32.216
Perce.

30:37.422 --> 30:39.925
You couldn't bring her in?

30:40.059 --> 30:43.394
Okay. I gotta run.
Okay. Bye.

30:45.597 --> 30:48.266
- Good job, Jackson.
- Thank you, sir. I think that went pretty well.

30:48.399 --> 30:50.268
Yeah, don't get
too comfortable, boys.

30:50.401 --> 30:52.403
That big-city lawyer
won't let this die in Humboldt.

30:52.537 --> 30:54.807
While we wait,
I'm gonna stir up some press.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.507
More to come.

31:00.779 --> 31:03.247
<i>Other farmers
say that they have come to rely</i>

31:03.381 --> 31:05.784
<i>on Monsanto seeds
for higher yields.</i>

31:05.918 --> 31:08.686
<i>Meanwhile, Schmeiser's
defense team is asserting</i>

31:08.821 --> 31:10.756
<i>that the genetically
modified seeds</i>

31:10.889 --> 31:12.925
<i>were blown
from his neighbor's truck</i>

31:13.058 --> 31:14.592
<i>as he drove by his fields.</i>

31:14.726 --> 31:16.628
<i>The trial will be resuming
later this month.</i>

31:16.762 --> 31:18.764
<i>The judge resides...</i>

31:20.298 --> 31:21.800
<i>So, here's the verdict.</i>

31:21.934 --> 31:25.670
<i>"A farmer whose field
contains seed or plants</i>

31:25.804 --> 31:28.673
originating from seed
spilled into them

31:28.807 --> 31:32.543
or blown as seed in swaths
from a neighbor's land,

31:32.677 --> 31:34.579
or even growing
from germination

31:34.712 --> 31:36.949
by pollen carried
into his field from elsewhere,

31:37.082 --> 31:41.185
does not own the right to use
the patented gene, or seed,

31:41.319 --> 31:43.889
or plant containing the gene."

31:46.491 --> 31:47.793
What does it mean?

31:47.926 --> 31:49.762
It means it doesn't matter
how it got there,

31:49.895 --> 31:51.764
or what percentage
is even contaminated.

31:51.897 --> 31:55.868
Everything you grew
belongs to Monsanto.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.403
How much do I owe?

32:00.304 --> 32:02.975
- $105,000.
- Oh.

32:03.108 --> 32:06.477
It's all the revenue
from your 1998 crop,

32:06.611 --> 32:09.447
plus Monsanto's legal fees.

32:09.580 --> 32:12.450
And, Percy, it says here that
you're instructed to hand over

32:12.583 --> 32:15.553
all seeds
from last year's crop.

32:17.823 --> 32:20.425
Everything I got's
in those seeds.

32:22.627 --> 32:24.897
Nothing else we can do?

32:26.832 --> 32:28.366
You know,
I wouldn't advise it,

32:28.499 --> 32:31.202
but there may be grounds
for an appeal.

32:31.335 --> 32:32.805
It would draw this out longer.

32:32.938 --> 32:35.074
And, of course,
it would cost more...

32:35.206 --> 32:36.574
Money.

32:36.708 --> 32:38.576
This is getting out of hand.

32:38.710 --> 32:41.814
Also, I really...
I hate to bring this up now, but,

32:42.714 --> 32:45.550
there is the matter
of my fee as well.

32:47.418 --> 32:48.921
I'll see to it.

32:56.527 --> 32:59.865
You saying my farm's
not good enough collateral?

33:00.331 --> 33:02.000
Look, Percy,

33:02.134 --> 33:04.736
how long have we
known each other?

33:05.369 --> 33:07.572
Thanks for your time, Sam.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.144
- <i>Caller, you there?</i>
- <i>I don't like the seed companies,</i>

33:12.276 --> 33:15.214
<i>but as far as I can tell, Schmeiser's
a thief and deserves what he got.</i>

33:15.346 --> 33:18.917
<i>How could you be a farmer for
years and not know what's in your field?</i>

33:19.051 --> 33:22.320
<i>I've known Percy Schmeiser all my life...</i>

33:22.453 --> 33:24.388
<i>...and there's no way
he's a thief.</i>

33:25.023 --> 33:26.390
Hello.

33:28.227 --> 33:29.694
Hello?

33:40.906 --> 33:42.373
This a joke?

33:43.208 --> 33:44.943
Best I can do.

33:47.678 --> 33:50.414
Resells aren't what
they used to be, Perce.

33:53.351 --> 33:55.586
You sure
you wanna plant these oats?

33:56.587 --> 33:58.723
I gotta put something
in the ground.

34:21.512 --> 34:23.849
Hey, we're watching you,
seed-stealer.

34:25.017 --> 34:26.717
Good luck getting home.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.421
It's no more than
an eighth of a teaspoon.

34:30.555 --> 34:32.057
Mm-hmm. Doesn't it
smell good in here?

34:36.028 --> 34:37.095
Are we late?

34:44.735 --> 34:45.904
Louise.

34:46.737 --> 34:48.974
Did you pay
the fencing bill?

34:49.107 --> 34:50.575
It says we're past due.

34:50.708 --> 34:53.678
Brenda and I have been voted
off the Planning Committee.

35:00.319 --> 35:03.487
If you're making tea,
I'll have a cup.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.230
Okay. There you are.

35:11.362 --> 35:12.931
What's wrong?

35:14.166 --> 35:15.566
Louise...

35:18.937 --> 35:22.506
Apparently,
given our current situation,

35:22.640 --> 35:25.643
we're not appropriate
to represent the community.

35:25.777 --> 35:28.479
Brenda's furious.
She blames us.

35:28.613 --> 35:30.349
What's Brenda
got to do with it?

35:30.481 --> 35:32.150
Alton gave evidence for you.

35:32.284 --> 35:33.952
So, it's my fault?

35:34.086 --> 35:35.586
If the cap fits...

35:35.720 --> 35:37.555
It's just pies.

35:38.589 --> 35:40.424
It's not just pies.

35:40.558 --> 35:43.962
It's our friendships,
it's our community.

35:44.695 --> 35:46.731
I'll sort it out.

35:46.865 --> 35:48.033
Louise...

35:54.039 --> 35:56.241
<i>You don't know
how strong the patent is</i>

35:56.375 --> 35:59.543
<i>until Schmeiser violates it
and it's upheld in court.</i>

35:59.677 --> 36:01.113
<i>The decision
has set a world standard</i>

36:01.246 --> 36:03.248
<i>in intellectual property
protection.</i>

36:03.382 --> 36:05.416
Okay, stop.

36:07.152 --> 36:09.788
It's good press, but it's not
gonna do anything to stop wheat.

36:09.922 --> 36:12.124
He's the best lead we've got
and you know it.

36:14.126 --> 36:15.426
Is he even appealing?

36:15.559 --> 36:17.930
Not yet.
But I can convince him.

36:18.063 --> 36:18.864
He won't win.

36:18.997 --> 36:21.266
We do not need him
to win, Roger.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.168
We just need him
to keep fighting.

36:23.302 --> 36:26.038
He hasn't signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

36:26.171 --> 36:28.006
So, he can still go public.

36:28.140 --> 36:31.910
He's 150K in the hole
and we can use that.

36:32.044 --> 36:36.348
Imagine, this poor, naive,
salt-of-the-earth farmer

36:36.480 --> 36:40.584
publicly brought to ruin at the
hands of the evil corporation.

36:40.718 --> 36:44.356
By the time we're done, there won't be
a single representative in Washington

36:44.488 --> 36:46.325
who'll support wheat.

36:46.457 --> 36:48.427
Schmeiser...
I can't sell that name.

36:48.559 --> 36:52.164
It sounds like a beer.
Schmeiser Light.

36:53.531 --> 36:56.401
I don't see the return on this.
We don't have the budget.

36:56.534 --> 36:57.903
Don't give me a per diem.

37:00.772 --> 37:03.942
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
But, Rebecca,

37:04.076 --> 37:06.011
you have to
make this real now.

37:06.144 --> 37:07.611
I'll take the bus.

37:09.448 --> 37:11.016
Take the bus.

37:20.025 --> 37:22.727
I'm sorry
I don't have more to offer.

37:22.861 --> 37:24.196
No time for baking.

37:25.696 --> 37:26.832
We're doing fine.

37:26.965 --> 37:28.532
Of course.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.169
I come from a family
of farmers,

37:31.303 --> 37:35.173
so I understand
how resilient you have to be.

37:35.841 --> 37:37.943
Your people are farmers?

37:38.076 --> 37:41.612
Well, not my parents,
but on my mother's side a ways back.

37:41.746 --> 37:44.082
I have cousins in Minnesota
who grow wheat.

37:44.749 --> 37:47.152
Now, Percy,
last time I saw you,

37:47.285 --> 37:49.520
you said you were
not interested in speaking.

37:49.653 --> 37:51.223
Still ain't.

37:51.356 --> 37:56.161
Okay. Well, I'm assuming
that you have seen this.

37:57.262 --> 37:59.898
This is a printout
from Monsanto's website.

38:04.735 --> 38:11.176
That says that you knowingly
segregated and planted their seeds.

38:11.309 --> 38:16.114
That's their message,
and they are spreading it every day.

38:16.248 --> 38:20.919
Now, I just thought you might want a
chance to tell your side of the story.

38:22.354 --> 38:23.989
I'm figuring to appeal.

38:24.722 --> 38:26.925
Nothing's been decided yet.

38:27.691 --> 38:30.762
Well, how much
would an appeal cost?

38:30.896 --> 38:32.164
We can help with that.

38:32.297 --> 38:34.199
We would set up
public speaking forums for you

38:34.332 --> 38:36.868
and collect donations
from the audience.

38:37.002 --> 38:39.004
And how much money
are we going to bring in?

38:39.137 --> 38:41.440
Well, that would
depend on Percy,

38:41.572 --> 38:44.810
on how hard
he's willing to work.

38:45.777 --> 38:48.746
But maybe a few thousand.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.217
Maybe ten.
Maybe hundreds of thousands.

38:52.350 --> 38:53.452
What's your cut?

38:53.584 --> 38:54.786
No cut.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.989
100% of what is donated
to you goes to you.

38:58.123 --> 39:00.058
And we'd cover
any travel expenses.

39:00.192 --> 39:03.795
Uh-huh.
What's in it for you?

39:05.564 --> 39:08.732
The PEP is trying its hardest

39:08.867 --> 39:12.504
to stop GMO wheat
before they sneak it in.

39:12.636 --> 39:14.206
You're helping us
raise awareness.

39:15.673 --> 39:17.843
Please think about it.

39:30.088 --> 39:33.325
I'll make up the spare room
for you, dear.

39:39.264 --> 39:42.901
Hi, everybody.
Hey, thanks for coming.

39:43.034 --> 39:45.904
Look, uh,
I know times are tough.

39:46.037 --> 39:48.340
We're here to offer solutions.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.642
If you plant Monsanto's
genetically engineered seed,

39:51.776 --> 39:53.879
our trials are showing
that you actually farm

39:54.012 --> 39:56.181
twice the amount of land
in half the amount of time.

39:56.314 --> 39:59.351
What if I ain't got twice the land?

39:59.484 --> 40:02.487
Well, then I suggest that
you start looking for more,

40:02.621 --> 40:04.956
because if you want to
get rid of your weed problems,

40:05.090 --> 40:08.894
all you gotta do is spray
Roundup on your crop two times,

40:09.027 --> 40:11.296
once two weeks after you plant,

40:11.429 --> 40:15.967
and then mid-season when the
canola's about knee-height,

40:16.101 --> 40:18.136
and then,
you're doing well until harvest.

40:18.270 --> 40:20.138
You might even get
a week's worth of vacation.

40:20.272 --> 40:23.008
Smells like a stinkin'
pile of manure to me.

40:24.675 --> 40:28.246
Okay, well, look, guys,
I can sell you different seed varieties,

40:28.380 --> 40:31.383
- but nothing is gonna be as good as these.
- What are you doing here?

40:31.516 --> 40:34.252
- I'll even bet you $500...
- Nothing. Just checking it out.

40:34.386 --> 40:36.788
...you won't even find
anything else out there like it.

40:36.922 --> 40:40.258
Now, look, there are
some growers out there

40:40.392 --> 40:42.928
that are trying to
get the same advantages

40:43.061 --> 40:45.163
you are all willing
to pay good money for,

40:45.297 --> 40:48.867
by growing our seed
without a license.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.770
As far as I'm concerned,
that's freeloading and it's stealing,

40:51.903 --> 40:55.140
and not just from Monsanto,
but from you too.

40:55.273 --> 40:58.376
So, if you hear anything
or see anything suspicious,

40:58.510 --> 41:01.580
we have a 1-800 number,
it's totally anonymous...

41:01.712 --> 41:02.914
It's a damn snitch line!

41:04.783 --> 41:07.052
They want us
to rat each other out!

41:07.185 --> 41:10.422
- You're nothing but a two-bit thief!
- Who said that?

41:10.555 --> 41:12.290
The newspapers!

41:12.424 --> 41:14.693
Okay, calm down, guys.
Calm down.

41:14.826 --> 41:18.129
Look, it's not a snitch line.

41:18.263 --> 41:20.098
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

41:20.232 --> 41:22.500
Look, guys,
come up and get some cards,

41:22.634 --> 41:27.272
sign up before it's too late
and go ahead and grab some ribs.

42:04.276 --> 42:06.511
We're appealing this case.

42:06.645 --> 42:08.346
What do I have to do?

42:12.250 --> 42:13.985
You've gone over
what you're gonna say?

42:14.119 --> 42:15.820
Only about a hundred times.

42:15.954 --> 42:19.024
- Well, simple and straightforward is best.
- I'm gonna talk about...

42:19.157 --> 42:20.792
Thank you for joining us

42:20.925 --> 42:22.727
for what's to be
an informative discussion

42:22.861 --> 42:24.229
about the dangers of GMOs

42:24.362 --> 42:27.299
or "Genetically
Modified Organisms."

42:29.668 --> 42:32.737
But we at the PEP
can't do this ourselves.

42:32.871 --> 42:36.374
To stop what's coming,
it's going to take a lot of us

42:36.508 --> 42:39.277
standing up
and having our voices heard,

42:39.411 --> 42:41.781
which brings me
to our next speaker,

42:41.913 --> 42:46.017
a farmer who has been fighting
a legal battle against Monsanto.

42:46.151 --> 42:49.054
His name is Percy Schmeiser.

42:49.187 --> 42:50.355
Percy.

43:02.434 --> 43:04.169
Yeah, uh...

43:06.438 --> 43:07.505
I am a...

43:09.809 --> 43:11.042
I am...

43:13.345 --> 43:14.846
a farmer.

43:15.647 --> 43:17.282
I grow canola.

43:18.683 --> 43:20.385
I did.

43:21.286 --> 43:23.488
My granddad used to say

43:23.621 --> 43:27.025
that each farming season
carried a promise

43:28.259 --> 43:32.931
that the seeds would get
a little bit stronger.

43:34.265 --> 43:40.972
He said that if you follow
seeds back through generations,

43:43.208 --> 43:47.847
you'd get an unbroken history to
the beginning of recorded time.

43:48.814 --> 43:52.584
Civilization started
when we figured out how to farm.

43:52.717 --> 43:55.253
Farming is the foundation

43:55.954 --> 43:58.556
for everything we care about.

43:58.690 --> 44:04.429
They said I've grown Monsanto's
canola without a license.

44:04.562 --> 44:06.398
It don't matter
how it got there.

44:06.531 --> 44:10.735
Wherever a plant grows
that contains Monsanto's gene,

44:11.369 --> 44:13.571
it belongs to the company.

44:13.705 --> 44:20.712
Everything I worked
all my life for is theirs.

44:20.846 --> 44:24.616
So, my wife and I figure...

44:27.252 --> 44:29.721
we gotta keep fighting.
All right?

44:30.355 --> 44:33.391
That's it. Thank you.

44:36.161 --> 44:40.900
St. John's, Newfoundland,
Oakland, California...

44:41.032 --> 44:43.234
28 cities.

44:44.269 --> 44:46.438
People don't even farm
most of those places.

44:46.571 --> 44:49.140
That's right.
We're spreading your message.

44:52.544 --> 44:53.711
All right?

44:54.880 --> 44:56.181
That's it.

44:58.149 --> 44:59.551
<i>...a farmer.</i>

45:00.251 --> 45:03.087
<i>I grow canola. I did.</i>

45:03.221 --> 45:05.390
<i>My granddad used to say</i>

45:05.523 --> 45:08.126
that each farming season
carried a promise

45:09.127 --> 45:11.563
that the seeds would grow
a little bit stronger.

45:11.696 --> 45:15.935
He said that if you follow seeds
back through generations...

45:16.067 --> 45:19.103
Wheat is Monsanto's next target,

45:19.237 --> 45:22.173
a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry.

45:22.307 --> 45:24.442
If that happens, we have lost.

45:24.576 --> 45:26.311
Now, as the government,
the courts,

45:26.444 --> 45:29.214
they tell us
farmers' rights don't matter.

45:29.347 --> 45:31.082
Only the corporations matter.

45:31.216 --> 45:32.750
So, what's going to happen

45:32.885 --> 45:36.020
when we spray these toxic
substances onto our wheat?

45:36.154 --> 45:39.457
Wheat that is ground down into the
flour that is baked into bread.

45:39.591 --> 45:41.059
Can we get a comment?

45:41.192 --> 45:43.127
Him. Him. That guy.

45:46.932 --> 45:51.035
Monsanto owns it.
So, somehow, it's my obligation

45:51.169 --> 45:53.204
to check my land
for their seeds.

45:53.338 --> 45:55.273
Where's their obligation

45:55.406 --> 45:57.709
to make sure their seeds
don't get on my land?

45:57.843 --> 46:02.447
...by the time it gets to our
dinner plates, contains glyphosate,

46:02.580 --> 46:06.618
the main ingredient in
Monsanto's herbicide, Roundup.

46:23.167 --> 46:24.870
We're not backing down.

46:25.004 --> 46:26.471
What they're doing is not right

46:26.604 --> 46:29.207
and somebody's
got to say something.

46:38.483 --> 46:41.219
That was great. Good job.

46:46.691 --> 46:48.593
Hey, girl.

46:49.862 --> 46:52.263
How's the...

46:55.901 --> 46:59.470
This is great.
This is exactly what we need, Percy.

46:59.604 --> 47:03.174
This is big. Millions of people
see his column every week.

47:03.308 --> 47:05.010
Guess I better not
mess it up then.

47:05.143 --> 47:09.815
Why would you segregate the GMO
seeds unless you wanted to grow more?

47:09.949 --> 47:13.151
Back then, I didn't know
anything about patented seeds.

47:13.284 --> 47:15.486
- So, you did do it on purpose?
- No.

47:15.620 --> 47:19.223
- Tom, I think you're missing the point.
- Am I?

47:19.357 --> 47:22.126
'Cause it sounds to me like he
used Monsanto's seeds on purpose.

47:22.260 --> 47:28.299
I never bought them. You know how many
genes Monsanto puts into GMO canola?

47:29.001 --> 47:30.335
One in 5,000.

47:30.468 --> 47:32.136
They swap out
one gene in 5,000.

47:32.270 --> 47:35.740
Suddenly, I get sued
for doing the same thing

47:35.874 --> 47:38.242
my family's been doing
for hundreds of years.

47:38.376 --> 47:42.580
Which, lest we forget,
is toiling day in and day out,

47:42.714 --> 47:46.051
for very little pay,
to put food on our tables.

47:46.184 --> 47:47.685
That's right.

47:50.688 --> 47:52.423
Oh, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

47:52.557 --> 47:54.860
Karl sprayed this field
last week with glyphosate.

47:57.729 --> 48:01.000
Thank you, Tom. If you need anything
else, please give my office a call.

48:01.132 --> 48:02.868
Sounds good.
Take care. Thank you.

48:05.670 --> 48:07.739
Nobody'd be spraying
this time of year.

48:07.873 --> 48:09.507
He doesn't know that.

48:10.809 --> 48:12.477
<i>"Seeds of discord.</i>

48:12.610 --> 48:14.278
<i>For doing
what he's always done,</i>

48:14.412 --> 48:16.681
Percy Schmeiser,
a Saskatchewan canola farmer,

48:16.815 --> 48:19.550
is being sued by
agribusiness giant Monsanto

48:19.684 --> 48:22.353
in landmark seed piracy case."

48:22.487 --> 48:25.723
Front page of the <i>Washington Post.</i>
It's huge!

48:47.578 --> 48:51.784
This one says he was fined
for growing GMO soy.

48:51.917 --> 48:54.519
He couldn't afford to fight it,
but he wants you to keep going.

48:54.652 --> 48:57.288
He has included
a check for $10.

48:57.422 --> 49:00.324
So many people.
Who'd have thought it?

49:00.458 --> 49:03.862
See, Percy, press pays.

49:05.130 --> 49:07.398
People are so generous.

49:11.269 --> 49:13.204
- Hello, Mr. Schmeiser.
- Hello.

49:30.856 --> 49:33.391
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Percy, I think Monsanto's</i>

49:33.524 --> 49:35.194
<i>security guys are on my land.</i>

49:35.326 --> 49:37.763
- Say again?
- <i>They're here.</i>

49:38.329 --> 49:39.497
<i>Can you get over here?</i>

49:39.630 --> 49:41.332
Okay, I'm coming.

49:42.567 --> 49:43.701
Oh!

49:52.845 --> 49:55.513
I've told you
to get out of my field!

49:55.646 --> 49:57.248
I've called the police.

50:03.287 --> 50:04.757
Get off this man's property.

50:04.890 --> 50:06.925
Whoa, come on,
there's no need for that.

50:07.059 --> 50:08.026
You're trespassing!

50:08.160 --> 50:09.494
Come on, let's go.

50:11.964 --> 50:13.698
You can't intimidate
these people!

50:13.832 --> 50:16.201
We won't stop.
We won't stop

50:16.334 --> 50:19.772
until you stop spraying your chemicals on our food!

50:20.438 --> 50:22.340
I'm gonna sue your ass.

50:23.307 --> 50:24.642
Go for it.

50:29.647 --> 50:31.784
Hey.

50:40.025 --> 50:42.560
The reason
they're going after Alton

50:43.461 --> 50:45.964
is because he's supporting us.

50:46.098 --> 50:48.533
That's how these big
seed companies work.

50:48.666 --> 50:50.836
They go after anyone
who speaks out against them.

50:50.969 --> 50:53.105
That's why this appeal
is so important.

50:53.238 --> 50:54.873
Well, we can't afford
a lawyer.

50:55.673 --> 50:57.776
They're tearing
our community apart.

50:58.543 --> 51:00.411
We gotta stand together.

51:02.114 --> 51:04.682
With what money?

51:07.286 --> 51:09.687
You haven't paid us in weeks

51:10.688 --> 51:12.623
and you're never here.

51:14.425 --> 51:16.460
Look, your crops are failing.

51:43.088 --> 51:46.724
Never thought I'd be
asking help from strangers.

51:47.326 --> 51:48.961
Well, you did.

51:50.996 --> 51:54.665
But it doesn't do any good
unless you take it.

51:56.001 --> 51:58.003
We're talking about
people's hard-earned money.

51:58.136 --> 51:59.704
It just don't feel right.

52:01.706 --> 52:03.976
You should read
the letters.

52:20.558 --> 52:23.328
<i>"Dear Percy and
Louise, when I read your story</i>

52:23.461 --> 52:26.064
<i>and what Monsanto's doing with
their genetically modified seeds,</i>

52:26.198 --> 52:28.233
<i>it made me sick.
What gives them the right to patent..."</i>

52:28.367 --> 52:30.068
<i>"When they came after
me, I settled.</i>

52:30.202 --> 52:33.372
<i>But now, I wish I didn't.
I'm behind you all the way."</i>

52:36.141 --> 52:38.043
<i>"Thank you
for what you're doing.</i>

52:38.176 --> 52:39.811
<i>I own a bakery
and I'm terrified</i>

52:39.945 --> 52:42.546
<i>Monsanto will give us
genetically modified wheat."</i>

52:42.680 --> 52:44.182
<i>"Dear Mr. Schmeiser,</i>

52:44.316 --> 52:47.119
<i>many farmers here in southern
Pakistan are struggling</i>

52:47.252 --> 52:50.022
<i>under the introduction
of genetically modified crops."</i>

52:52.157 --> 52:54.893
<i>"Maybe we can be like
you and your wife. Thank you.</i>

52:55.027 --> 52:57.461
<i>We enclosed a check.
It's not much,</i>

52:57.595 --> 52:59.031
<i>but it comes
with our best wishes."</i>

52:59.164 --> 53:00.866
<i>"We have very little money,</i>

53:00.999 --> 53:03.467
<i>but we'll do what we can
to support your cause."</i>

53:09.975 --> 53:15.113
So, I have found a way for you
to make some extra money.

53:15.247 --> 53:18.749
You've been invited to speak at
a major international conference

53:18.884 --> 53:21.420
on food security
in India next month.

53:21.552 --> 53:24.689
India?
What about the harvest?

53:25.958 --> 53:29.660
Uh, I had to pull some major
strings to make this happen.

53:29.795 --> 53:32.697
This is a big deal.
There'll be dignitaries,

53:32.831 --> 53:35.533
philanthropists,
agents of change.

53:36.467 --> 53:38.370
<i>The whole world is watching!</i>

53:38.502 --> 53:40.005
The whole world is watching!

53:40.138 --> 53:41.706
- Excuse me, Mr. Schmeiser.
- Excuse me.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.541
- Mr. Schmeiser.
- We just want to get inside.

53:43.674 --> 53:46.178
What are your chances
in this appeal?

53:46.311 --> 53:47.879
I feel confident.

53:48.013 --> 53:50.983
No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO!

53:51.116 --> 53:52.583
No, no, GMO!

54:01.193 --> 54:04.396
You okay?
It was quite a scene out there.

54:04.528 --> 54:06.231
- I'm fine.
- Good.

54:08.333 --> 54:11.736
About India, I could
really use your support.

54:11.870 --> 54:14.806
Well, that's up to Percy.

54:14.940 --> 54:17.175
He won't go
without your blessing.

54:19.011 --> 54:21.847
It could mean
a lot more money in donations.

54:23.782 --> 54:25.716
- We need him at home.
- I know, but if you...

54:37.329 --> 54:40.866
If you stop him from fighting
this, he'll resent you for it.

54:41.967 --> 54:43.835
You don't know
what you're talking about.

54:43.969 --> 54:46.238
What about Brenda and Alton?

54:47.039 --> 54:48.739
Now they've been
dragged into this.

54:48.874 --> 54:51.810
The only way to help them
is to continue working with us.

54:52.610 --> 54:54.046
Rebecca...

54:55.213 --> 54:57.949
some things are more
important than your campaign.

54:59.251 --> 55:01.719
Your grandmother
and your grandfather

55:01.853 --> 55:03.789
weren't farmers, were they?

55:03.922 --> 55:06.792
But you'll say anything
to get what you want.

55:06.925 --> 55:09.693
This is not about
what I want.

55:10.495 --> 55:12.164
Rebecca,

55:13.465 --> 55:15.767
Percy will do
the right thing.

55:22.240 --> 55:23.641
Excuse me.

55:24.509 --> 55:27.045
Took me, like,
six hours to get here.

55:36.054 --> 55:39.723
The Third District Court
of Appeals is now in session.

55:47.999 --> 55:49.501
It's like
they're multiplying.

55:49.633 --> 55:52.370
Mr. Weaver, shall we begin?

55:56.508 --> 55:58.376
Good morning, My Lord.

55:58.510 --> 56:03.782
Mr. Schmeiser's 17 grounds
for appeal are as follows.

56:03.915 --> 56:06.151
A, interpreting the Patent Act

56:06.284 --> 56:09.087
so as to deprive farmers
the ownership

56:09.221 --> 56:13.191
of canola plants and seed
containing the patented gene.

56:13.325 --> 56:15.894
B, finding that
it is not necessary

56:16.027 --> 56:18.363
that a farmer take advantage
of the patented gene...

56:18.497 --> 56:21.066
<i>The trial's expected
to last up to three weeks.</i>

56:21.199 --> 56:23.835
Monsanto will continue
with its case tomorrow,

56:23.969 --> 56:26.605
focusing on the investigation
that led to the discovery

56:26.737 --> 56:28.607
<i>of the genetically
modified canola.</i>

56:28.739 --> 56:30.542
<i>Percy Schmeiser sees himself</i>

56:30.674 --> 56:32.444
<i>as David up against Goliath.</i>

56:32.577 --> 56:36.615
<i>A 73-year-old farmer
trying to stop big agribusiness</i>

56:36.747 --> 56:39.650
<i>from controlling
the seeds he plants.</i>

56:42.821 --> 56:44.990
So, about India...

56:45.656 --> 56:47.926
I can't go to India.

56:48.059 --> 56:50.228
I need to take care
of my business.

56:50.362 --> 56:51.463
I understand.

56:52.364 --> 56:55.834
But what about all those
farmers that wrote you?

56:55.967 --> 56:59.037
This is a chance
to give them a voice

56:59.171 --> 57:01.606
in front of
a global audience.

57:01.739 --> 57:04.075
Are you just gonna
let them down?

57:04.209 --> 57:06.011
I didn't promise them
anything.

57:06.144 --> 57:10.315
You took their money
and you cashed their checks.

58:04.002 --> 58:05.437
What is that?

58:06.838 --> 58:08.506
<i>Seed has always been</i>

58:08.640 --> 58:10.976
<i>a renewable resource
in farmers' hands.</i>

58:11.109 --> 58:13.612
<i>Seed that is renewable
by its very nature</i>

58:13.744 --> 58:15.247
<i>is now made non-renewable</i>

58:15.380 --> 58:17.816
<i>and we see the consequences
of this in India</i>

58:17.949 --> 58:21.186
<i>where, since the big companies
came in</i>

58:21.319 --> 58:23.755
<i>and took over the seed supply,
especially in cotton,</i>

58:23.888 --> 58:28.593
<i>we have had
270,000 farmer suicides,</i>

58:28.727 --> 58:30.929
<i>most of them driven by debt</i>

58:31.062 --> 58:34.299
<i>and the debt caused by
high-cost non-renewable seeds.</i>

58:59.324 --> 59:01.593
Now, it's going to get
a little hectic,

59:01.726 --> 59:04.496
so stay focused, on message.

59:06.598 --> 59:07.932
Percy?

59:10.468 --> 59:12.170
Stay focused, yeah.

59:22.714 --> 59:24.149
Hello.

59:27.085 --> 59:30.722
Monsanto says you should know

59:30.855 --> 59:34.993
if you've got their genetic
property on your land. But how?

59:35.894 --> 59:39.297
Their GM crop
looks exactly the same.

59:39.864 --> 59:41.833
The only way you can know

59:41.966 --> 59:44.869
is by spraying your field
with their chemicals.

59:45.003 --> 59:47.906
Then, everything that dies

59:48.039 --> 59:50.975
and is worthless,
that's what belongs to you.

59:51.109 --> 59:56.548
Everything that survives
has their GM gene

59:57.215 --> 59:59.250
and belongs to the company.

1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:04.723
- I am from South Africa.
- Hello.

1:00:04.856 --> 1:00:07.092
We have a drought.
Scientists are saying

1:00:07.225 --> 1:00:11.429
GM crops are the only way
to stop millions starving.

1:00:11.563 --> 1:00:14.800
- You're saying you want my family to starve?
- No, I'm not saying that.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:26.311
No, this is important.
GMOs can help us.

1:00:26.444 --> 1:00:30.515
In the '80s, the University
of Hawaii created a GM papaya

1:00:30.648 --> 1:00:34.386
resistant to a virus that was
wiping out the local crop.

1:00:34.519 --> 1:00:38.156
- It saved the whole industry.
- I'm not aware of that.

1:00:38.289 --> 1:00:41.827
Oh, come on!
As if big agro cares about food.

1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:43.294
They only care about money!

1:01:06.985 --> 1:01:08.453
Folks!

1:01:09.220 --> 1:01:12.157
Don't fight! Don't do it.

1:01:12.290 --> 1:01:14.025
It's what they want...

1:01:16.194 --> 1:01:17.863
for us to fuss and argue

1:01:17.996 --> 1:01:21.566
'cause, while we fight,
they take over.

1:01:30.008 --> 1:01:32.410
In this country, people die.

1:01:33.611 --> 1:01:37.449
They get into debt to Monsanto,
they lose land.

1:01:38.383 --> 1:01:41.953
Sometimes, they end their life.

1:01:43.254 --> 1:01:48.159
For me, I understand
that I might lose my farm.

1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.962
Now, if they take my farm,

1:01:51.996 --> 1:01:54.032
if they take my land,

1:01:56.067 --> 1:01:57.535
that's it.

1:01:59.003 --> 1:02:00.472
There's nothing left.

1:02:00.605 --> 1:02:02.440
So, I get it.

1:02:04.242 --> 1:02:08.546
No one's gonna help us but us.

1:02:12.650 --> 1:02:15.286
We gotta stop fighting.

1:02:20.492 --> 1:02:23.094
Do not give them what they want.

1:02:51.256 --> 1:02:53.157
Pretty noisy in there.
Boisterous.

1:02:53.291 --> 1:02:55.126
Yeah, you could say that.

1:02:56.628 --> 1:02:59.832
I saw your speech,
Mr. Schmeiser.

1:03:00.532 --> 1:03:03.101
It's not an easy thing to do.

1:03:04.702 --> 1:03:06.839
That's for sure.

1:03:06.972 --> 1:03:11.476
We've heard your story.
You're fighting back. You make us hope.

1:03:11.609 --> 1:03:15.213
You... you are our hero,
our champion.

1:03:16.281 --> 1:03:19.350
I'm a farmer, just a farmer.

1:03:20.786 --> 1:03:22.520
I, too, am just a farmer.

1:03:25.891 --> 1:03:28.726
Would you like to see
a little bit of my India?

1:03:56.055 --> 1:03:58.656
We consider it holy
to feed a cow.

1:04:04.662 --> 1:04:08.266
In India, we small farmers feed
more than one billion people.

1:04:08.399 --> 1:04:11.402
And a lot of this produce

1:04:11.536 --> 1:04:14.205
comes from villages
just like mine,

1:04:15.074 --> 1:04:18.376
these vegetables,
onions, potatoes.

1:04:26.584 --> 1:04:30.521
<i>A few years ago,
GMOs came promising miracles.</i>

1:04:31.522 --> 1:04:33.591
<i>Their seed is not meant
for our climate.</i>

1:04:33.725 --> 1:04:35.660
<i>It's meant for irrigated land</i>

1:04:35.794 --> 1:04:38.797
<i>and seems to need much,
much higher amounts of water</i>

1:04:38.931 --> 1:04:40.698
<i>than we have from the rains.</i>

1:04:45.871 --> 1:04:47.639
This is my village.

1:04:47.773 --> 1:04:52.077
Seventy-five percent have lost
their land to pay off debts.

1:04:52.210 --> 1:04:54.913
Five young men
have taken their own lives.

1:04:55.047 --> 1:04:56.815
What about your farm?

1:04:56.949 --> 1:05:00.618
I have relatives in all these
homes, many of these homes.

1:05:04.255 --> 1:05:06.058
A lot of them
have seen suffering.

1:05:15.067 --> 1:05:16.567
Oi!

1:05:17.468 --> 1:05:19.838
This is my village, sir.

1:05:26.678 --> 1:05:28.246
This way, sir.

1:05:34.352 --> 1:05:36.989
Why were you
at the conference, Vasu?

1:05:37.122 --> 1:05:39.490
I was there
to support my son.

1:05:40.224 --> 1:05:41.492
You have a son, sir?

1:05:41.626 --> 1:05:42.895
I do.

1:05:43.028 --> 1:05:44.830
- Is he a farmer, too?
- No.

1:05:47.632 --> 1:05:51.602
Perhaps in times such as these
that is not such a bad thing.

1:05:51.736 --> 1:05:53.072
Did your son...

1:05:53.204 --> 1:05:54.639
He was a farmer.

1:05:55.740 --> 1:05:58.877
Would you like a cup of tea?
That's my daughter-in-law.

1:06:28.207 --> 1:06:29.540
Hi.

1:06:42.121 --> 1:06:43.822
- Sir.
- Thanks.

1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:52.263
These companies are
going to swallow us up.

1:07:10.883 --> 1:07:14.552
Do you know
of the Bhagavad Gita?

1:07:16.188 --> 1:07:18.289
In it there's a saying,

1:07:18.422 --> 1:07:21.059
"Don't measure
the results of your actions.

1:07:21.193 --> 1:07:22.795
Measure the effort.

1:07:22.928 --> 1:07:26.297
Most important
is to do the right thing."

1:07:53.125 --> 1:07:54.358
Percy...

1:07:56.527 --> 1:07:58.729
it's Louise.

1:08:32.097 --> 1:08:33.731
Louise...

1:08:36.268 --> 1:08:37.668
Hey.

1:08:43.374 --> 1:08:45.376
They told me
she fell down the stairs.

1:08:45.509 --> 1:08:49.214
Yeah. I found her
on the living room floor.

1:08:49.348 --> 1:08:51.382
She was there
for five hours.

1:08:53.417 --> 1:08:54.518
How could that happen?

1:08:54.652 --> 1:08:56.054
Come on, Dad.

1:08:57.122 --> 1:08:59.523
With the stress
that she's been under,

1:08:59.657 --> 1:09:01.692
I mean, up there all alone...

1:09:04.830 --> 1:09:08.733
You should go home now, Pete.
Get some rest.

1:09:08.867 --> 1:09:13.171
And thanks...
for looking after your mom.

1:09:25.851 --> 1:09:27.119
I'll see you later.

1:09:27.252 --> 1:09:28.552
Yeah.

1:09:34.092 --> 1:09:35.994
Louise...

1:09:36.128 --> 1:09:38.797
<i>In this appeal,
the parties made submissions</i>

1:09:38.931 --> 1:09:41.732
<i>on a large number
of relevant factors.</i>

1:09:41.867 --> 1:09:44.735
<i>It is the unanimous decision
of this court</i>

1:09:44.870 --> 1:09:46.704
<i>that there is no basis
for interfering</i>

1:09:46.838 --> 1:09:50.008
<i>with the exercise
of the trial judge's decision.</i>

1:09:50.142 --> 1:09:53.577
<i>The appeal
will therefore be dismissed.</i>

1:09:57.249 --> 1:10:00.218
Just a bit under $1.2 million.

1:10:00.352 --> 1:10:01.987
That's how much you owe.

1:10:02.921 --> 1:10:06.325
Consultation fees, 44,000.

1:10:06.457 --> 1:10:09.593
Travel expenses, 57,000.

1:10:09.727 --> 1:10:12.097
Meals and entertainment,

1:10:12.530 --> 1:10:13.765
1,400.

1:10:13.899 --> 1:10:17.002
That's it?
They had a party.

1:10:20.872 --> 1:10:23.208
We're gonna lose
the farm, Percy.

1:10:24.910 --> 1:10:27.813
This is what happens when
you get lawyers involved.

1:10:27.946 --> 1:10:29.480
I can't believe
you let this happen.

1:10:29.613 --> 1:10:31.249
I advised them against this
from the start.

1:10:31.383 --> 1:10:32.918
I told them this was dangerous.

1:10:33.051 --> 1:10:35.287
You get off taking on the big
boys, that's your thing.

1:10:35.420 --> 1:10:37.823
- Are you questioning my professional integrity?
- Yes!

1:10:37.956 --> 1:10:39.891
Are you kidding me?
I've been doing everything I can

1:10:40.025 --> 1:10:42.894
for the last two years,
up against a behemoth

1:10:43.028 --> 1:10:46.298
with... with infinite financial
and legal resources.

1:10:46.431 --> 1:10:48.000
And I'm completely on my own.

1:10:48.133 --> 1:10:50.335
I've been putting my...
my professional reputation,

1:10:50.469 --> 1:10:52.337
my career, on the line.

1:10:52.471 --> 1:10:54.006
And I never once...

1:10:58.276 --> 1:10:59.378
I'm sorry.

1:10:59.510 --> 1:11:02.014
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

1:11:06.318 --> 1:11:08.719
I know you don't want to hear
this, but it's my obligation

1:11:08.854 --> 1:11:10.455
to tell you that
you can appeal again...

1:11:10.588 --> 1:11:12.124
- No!
- ...to the Supreme Court.

1:11:12.257 --> 1:11:14.459
No! It's long past time
that we put an end to this.

1:11:14.592 --> 1:11:17.528
I am not advising it,
I'm not advocating for it, Peter.

1:11:17.661 --> 1:11:19.231
In fact, I'd probably
advise against it.

1:11:19.364 --> 1:11:24.136
Monsanto has put a lien
on everything you own...

1:11:24.970 --> 1:11:27.806
your house, your farm,
even your equipment.

1:11:30.275 --> 1:11:33.945
If you lose an appeal to the Supreme
Court, it could bankrupt you.

1:11:36.448 --> 1:11:37.949
I'm very sorry.

1:12:05.077 --> 1:12:05.844
Hello.

1:12:05.977 --> 1:12:08.013
<i>Hi, Percy.</i>

1:12:08.646 --> 1:12:09.548
How's Louise?

1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:11.049
Getting better.

1:12:11.183 --> 1:12:12.284
<i>Good, good.</i>

1:12:13.351 --> 1:12:16.221
So, have you, um...
have you given any thought

1:12:16.354 --> 1:12:17.989
<i>to your next move?</i>

1:12:18.857 --> 1:12:20.459
You're talking about appealing?

1:12:20.591 --> 1:12:24.796
<i>No. No. Actually, we, uh...
we don't think you should.</i>

1:12:25.663 --> 1:12:26.998
You think I'll lose.

1:12:27.132 --> 1:12:29.868
Can you imagine Jackson

1:12:30.001 --> 1:12:33.205
trying to keep up with
those million-dollar lawyers?

1:12:33.338 --> 1:12:35.807
It's a court case,
not a foot race.

1:12:36.541 --> 1:12:38.910
No, no, Percy. It's a...

1:12:39.044 --> 1:12:41.513
It's a precedent-setting
Supreme Court case.

1:12:41.645 --> 1:12:46.017
If Monsanto wins, it will solidify
their legal right to the patent.

1:12:46.151 --> 1:12:48.652
What about
all the other farmers?

1:12:50.755 --> 1:12:54.926
Percy, well, we said this
was for your family and, you know,

1:12:55.060 --> 1:12:57.728
<i>your family isn't doing so good
right now.</i>

1:12:57.863 --> 1:13:00.198
Now you care about my family.

1:13:02.467 --> 1:13:03.701
Well, it's your decision.

1:13:03.835 --> 1:13:07.072
But, uh,
if you decide to appeal,

1:13:07.205 --> 1:13:10.142
I cannot offer you
our support.

1:13:10.775 --> 1:13:12.277
That's fine.

1:13:13.677 --> 1:13:14.980
<i>I'm sorry, Percy.</i>

1:13:15.113 --> 1:13:16.248
Me too.

1:13:16.381 --> 1:13:17.549
<i>Percy, I'm...</i>

1:15:21.606 --> 1:15:22.907
Good luck getting home!

1:15:53.672 --> 1:15:55.140
There you are.

1:15:55.807 --> 1:15:58.476
I thought you were sleeping.

1:15:58.610 --> 1:16:01.579
I've prayed
more than I've slept.

1:16:02.981 --> 1:16:05.183
I can't do it anymore.

1:16:06.051 --> 1:16:07.852
Not gonna put you
through this.

1:16:07.986 --> 1:16:09.789
I'm done with all of it.

1:16:09.921 --> 1:16:11.523
No Supreme Court?

1:16:11.656 --> 1:16:13.925
No more appealing,
no nothing.

1:16:14.059 --> 1:16:18.563
I'll sign what I gotta sign
and I'll sell what I gotta sell.

1:16:21.466 --> 1:16:23.201
Well, I'm sorry,

1:16:23.335 --> 1:16:25.236
that doesn't sit well with me.

1:16:26.504 --> 1:16:29.007
What that company
has put you through,

1:16:30.108 --> 1:16:31.509
it isn't right.

1:16:31.643 --> 1:16:34.479
What that company is doing
to the other farmers,

1:16:34.612 --> 1:16:36.014
it's wrong.

1:16:38.850 --> 1:16:41.586
We'll lose everything.

1:16:42.387 --> 1:16:43.455
Not everything.

1:16:48.059 --> 1:16:52.964
So, Percy, it sounds like you've been pissing
people off on both sides of the fence here.

1:16:53.098 --> 1:16:54.966
Um, I hope not.

1:16:55.100 --> 1:16:56.901
- Are we ready?
- We're in.

1:16:57.035 --> 1:17:00.405
All right, here we go.
Percy, welcome.

1:17:01.639 --> 1:17:05.009
You've been accused of stealing
Monsanto's copyrighted material.

1:17:05.143 --> 1:17:06.945
How do you respond to that?

1:17:07.078 --> 1:17:11.449
What I did is the same thing
farmers have done since forever.

1:17:11.583 --> 1:17:13.385
No, it's the government,
the courts,

1:17:13.518 --> 1:17:16.588
they tell us
farmers' rights don't matter,

1:17:16.721 --> 1:17:18.056
only the corporations matter.

1:17:18.189 --> 1:17:19.825
Yes, but with all due respect,

1:17:19.958 --> 1:17:21.726
why should people believe you
over Monsanto?

1:17:21.861 --> 1:17:24.996
You know, to this day,
I do not know who it is I'm fighting.

1:17:25.130 --> 1:17:28.700
There's no Joe Monsanto,
just a bunch of lawyers.

1:17:28.834 --> 1:17:32.103
I mean, farmers know the land,
they know their plants.

1:17:32.237 --> 1:17:34.973
Monsanto knows winning
and losing and profits,

1:17:35.106 --> 1:17:38.143
and that's not good.

1:17:38.276 --> 1:17:39.978
She was from British Columbia.

1:17:40.111 --> 1:17:41.579
Eat up, Mary.
We're gonna be late.

1:17:41.713 --> 1:17:43.982
He called up his dad,
he said, "Dad, come out here.

1:17:44.115 --> 1:17:45.550
I want to show you
my new life."

1:17:45.683 --> 1:17:47.719
So, his father flies out
from Saskatchewan

1:17:47.853 --> 1:17:51.289
and they look out over the
mountains, the beautiful mountains.

1:17:51.423 --> 1:17:53.925
He says, "Dad,
what do you think of that view?"

1:17:54.058 --> 1:17:56.896
His father looks out
and he says,

1:17:58.563 --> 1:18:02.934
"You know, it wouldn't be bad if it weren't
for all those mountains in the way."

1:18:04.569 --> 1:18:05.805
I heard that one.

1:18:06.604 --> 1:18:08.940
<i>Percy!</i>

1:18:09.541 --> 1:18:11.109
That's Grandpa!

1:18:12.644 --> 1:18:14.345
<i>...the government, the courts,</i>

1:18:14.479 --> 1:18:16.981
<i>they tell us
farmers' rights don't matter,</i>

1:18:17.115 --> 1:18:18.784
<i>only the corporations matter.</i>

1:18:18.918 --> 1:18:21.352
<i>Monsanto knows winning
and losing and profits,</i>

1:18:21.486 --> 1:18:23.988
<i>and that's not good.</i>

1:18:24.122 --> 1:18:27.358
Right. Yet, despite intense
public interest,

1:18:27.492 --> 1:18:29.260
the courts have not ruled
in your favor.

1:18:29.394 --> 1:18:31.129
Are you worried
you'll lose your farm?

1:18:31.262 --> 1:18:32.730
I'm sure they'd love that...

1:18:32.865 --> 1:18:34.800
<i>see me gone and set an example</i>

1:18:34.934 --> 1:18:37.535
<i>in case some other farmer
wants to stand up.</i>

1:18:37.669 --> 1:18:41.306
That's why my wife
and I have decided...

1:18:45.109 --> 1:18:46.779
we're going
to the Supreme Court.

1:18:46.912 --> 1:18:50.715
Is... Wow. Is that something
your lawyers have advised?

1:18:50.850 --> 1:18:52.116
I don't know.

1:18:53.284 --> 1:18:55.553
I haven't told him yet.

1:19:12.771 --> 1:19:14.239
Oh, my God.

1:19:17.308 --> 1:19:19.277
It's my letter of resignation.

1:19:20.311 --> 1:19:22.915
I have never been
to the Supreme Court before.

1:19:24.048 --> 1:19:26.384
I mean, this is your family's
future we're talking about.

1:19:26.518 --> 1:19:29.120
In fact, it's the future
of agriculture.

1:19:29.254 --> 1:19:31.289
I mean, if you win,

1:19:31.422 --> 1:19:34.626
no farmer could ever be sued
for saving his seeds again.

1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:39.899
It is a very big deal.
We've lost the last two times,

1:19:40.031 --> 1:19:42.534
and you need to find
a better lawyer.

1:19:45.737 --> 1:19:47.305
Could I see that?

1:19:57.582 --> 1:19:58.784
Uh-huh.

1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:17.502
That's what I think.

1:20:17.635 --> 1:20:20.039
<i>We begin tonight
with a seismic legal shift</i>

1:20:20.171 --> 1:20:22.206
<i>on a case that could one day
affect us all.</i>

1:20:22.340 --> 1:20:23.809
<i>Percy Schmeiser and Monsanto</i>

1:20:23.943 --> 1:20:26.277
are taking their fight
to the Supreme Court of Canada.

1:20:26.411 --> 1:20:29.982
A David and Goliath legal battle over the
ownership of genetically modified seeds...

1:20:30.114 --> 1:20:32.985
<i>Monsanto, the corporation
behind dozens of lawsuits...</i>

1:20:33.117 --> 1:20:34.485
<i>...information and analysis</i>

1:20:34.619 --> 1:20:36.822
<i>that we did of his crop,
he must have known.</i>

1:20:36.956 --> 1:20:38.222
Hello.

1:20:38.356 --> 1:20:40.224
<i>The canola farmer
is being sued</i>

1:20:40.358 --> 1:20:42.761
<i>by a big multinational
corporation, Monsanto,</i>

1:20:42.895 --> 1:20:45.998
in a case where farmers around the
world are watching very closely.

1:20:46.130 --> 1:20:48.199
I'll be right back.

1:20:48.333 --> 1:20:50.101
The case is growing into
the biotech battlefield...

1:20:50.234 --> 1:20:52.737
<i>The federal court
judge who tried the case</i>

1:20:52.871 --> 1:20:54.706
<i>said in his ruling,
none of the suggested...</i>

1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:56.608
<i>Schmeiser claims
he does not know</i>

1:20:56.741 --> 1:20:58.576
<i>how the plants
got onto his land.</i>

1:20:58.710 --> 1:21:00.745
<i>...a multibillion-dollar,
globally operating</i>

1:21:00.879 --> 1:21:03.147
<i>biotech agricultural giant
takes on a 76-year-old...</i>

1:21:03.281 --> 1:21:05.884
<i>Two million people in
436 cities and 53 countries...</i>

1:21:06.018 --> 1:21:08.753
<i>To protect the farmers who
signed a contract with Monsanto...</i>

1:21:08.887 --> 1:21:11.356
<i>...protest focused on
genetically modified organisms.</i>

1:21:11.489 --> 1:21:13.625
<i>...the arguments from
the Monsanto legal team...</i>

1:21:13.759 --> 1:21:16.895
Scientists predict the impact could
be in the billions of dollars.

1:21:22.166 --> 1:21:24.535
We'll be right down.
Bye.

1:21:27.940 --> 1:21:29.240
There you are.

1:21:32.111 --> 1:21:33.511
Louise...

1:21:37.116 --> 1:21:38.750
I know.

1:21:39.785 --> 1:21:41.419
I love you, too.

1:21:46.257 --> 1:21:48.359
Let's do this.

1:21:49.795 --> 1:21:51.629
Okay.

1:21:51.764 --> 1:21:54.165
Sir, give us room, please.

1:21:54.298 --> 1:21:56.601
- Percy? Percy?
- Mr. Schmeiser, can you...

1:21:56.734 --> 1:21:59.972
Percy, why have you
taken the case this far?

1:22:00.105 --> 1:22:03.741
There's a lot of farmers around
the world who can't stand up.

1:22:04.676 --> 1:22:06.577
I figure I should.
Excuse me.

1:22:06.711 --> 1:22:08.746
Let them through, please.
Thank you.

1:22:10.515 --> 1:22:11.850
Any comments?

1:22:11.984 --> 1:22:14.185
We have no more
comment at this time.

1:22:14.318 --> 1:22:15.954
We have no more comment
at this time.

1:22:16.088 --> 1:22:17.790
Hey, Monsanto's here!

1:22:17.923 --> 1:22:19.557
Mr. Aarons?

1:22:21.359 --> 1:22:22.427
Just a comment?

1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:26.031
One comment. Sir? Ma'am?

1:22:28.167 --> 1:22:30.936
Wish you all the best.
You're in the big show now.

1:22:33.072 --> 1:22:36.942
This is a rather simple case
of patent infringement.

1:22:37.076 --> 1:22:38.844
The trial judge imposed

1:22:38.977 --> 1:22:41.312
and the Federal Court of Appeal
confirmed

1:22:41.446 --> 1:22:43.982
that there was
a knowing reproduction

1:22:44.116 --> 1:22:45.750
of a patented gene and cell

1:22:45.884 --> 1:22:50.022
by the commercial planting,
growing and selling

1:22:50.155 --> 1:22:52.825
of a canola product
that contained

1:22:52.958 --> 1:22:55.426
that patented gene and cell.

1:23:02.700 --> 1:23:04.903
If Percy Schmeiser has any seeds

1:23:06.138 --> 1:23:07.538
that contain the Monsanto gene,

1:23:07.672 --> 1:23:11.275
they did not come
into his possession

1:23:11.409 --> 1:23:13.511
through any patented process.

1:23:13.644 --> 1:23:16.048
They came into his possession

1:23:16.181 --> 1:23:20.953
in the way that seeds have been
cultivated by farmers for millennia...

1:23:21.086 --> 1:23:23.155
through natural breeding.

1:23:23.287 --> 1:23:25.523
Now, I believe
there is some sense

1:23:25.656 --> 1:23:27.291
that unless
Mr. Schmeiser loses today,

1:23:27.425 --> 1:23:29.427
unless there is
a victory for Monsanto,

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:31.529
then companies like Monsanto
will just

1:23:31.662 --> 1:23:34.066
<i>pull up their stakes
and go elsewhere.</i>

1:23:34.199 --> 1:23:36.201
<i>Well, that is not an argument</i>

1:23:36.334 --> 1:23:39.171
<i>that can hold any sway
in this case.</i>

1:23:39.303 --> 1:23:44.009
If there is no basis to hold
Mr. Schmeiser as an infringer,

1:23:44.143 --> 1:23:47.712
if, in fact, their patent doesn't
cover this type of invention,

1:23:47.846 --> 1:23:52.851
which is a living,
reproducing plant,

1:23:52.985 --> 1:23:54.953
then I implore you...

1:23:56.889 --> 1:23:58.623
let justice be done.

1:24:16.707 --> 1:24:18.944
- Percy?
- Yeah.

1:24:22.513 --> 1:24:24.348
Jackson called.

1:24:25.750 --> 1:24:28.519
The Supreme Court is reading
their decision tomorrow.

1:24:30.756 --> 1:24:33.591
- Mr. Schmeiser...
- Excuse me.

1:24:33.724 --> 1:24:35.426
Mr. Schmeiser, what decision
are you expecting?

1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:36.829
Excuse me.

1:24:36.962 --> 1:24:37.728
Mr. Schmeiser...

1:24:37.863 --> 1:24:39.697
Mr. Schmeiser,
was it worth it?

1:24:40.665 --> 1:24:42.801
Percy, come on, two minutes
for the people at home!

1:24:42.935 --> 1:24:45.369
Two minutes, Percy!

1:25:11.562 --> 1:25:13.131
Jackson Weaver.

1:25:14.233 --> 1:25:17.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go ahead.

1:25:18.837 --> 1:25:20.005
Uh-huh.

1:25:21.405 --> 1:25:23.674
Okay. Is that it?

1:25:25.376 --> 1:25:26.845
Got it.

1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:31.183
Well, come on, tell us.

1:25:31.316 --> 1:25:33.252
Spit it out.

1:25:33.919 --> 1:25:37.022
It's a split. Five to four.

1:25:37.722 --> 1:25:39.191
But Percy, Louise,

1:25:39.324 --> 1:25:42.693
the judges ruled that
you don't owe Monsanto anything.

1:25:42.828 --> 1:25:44.162
Praise the Lord.

1:25:44.296 --> 1:25:47.366
You get to keep all property,
the farm, everything.

1:25:47.498 --> 1:25:48.934
It's a blessing.

1:25:49.067 --> 1:25:52.838
There is one...
bit of bad news, though.

1:25:53.939 --> 1:25:59.177
They... They did decide that by
growing seeds with their gene,

1:25:59.311 --> 1:26:01.712
you did infringe
upon their patent.

1:26:02.848 --> 1:26:05.483
So, you do have to give
Monsanto all of your seeds.

1:26:07.451 --> 1:26:09.754
Oh, Percy.

1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:19.730
Let's go home. Thank you.

1:26:24.568 --> 1:26:27.873
Thank you, Mr. Weaver.
Thank you very, very much.

1:26:28.006 --> 1:26:29.942
You're very welcome.
Thank you.

1:26:34.279 --> 1:26:35.746
Yes!

1:26:39.117 --> 1:26:41.686
<i>The case has
set an international precedent</i>

1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:43.487
<i>in the fight against GMOs.</i>

1:26:43.621 --> 1:26:45.623
<i>Schmeiser has successfully
defended himself,</i>

1:26:45.757 --> 1:26:49.194
<i>opening more doors for farmers to
challenge the company in court.</i>

1:26:50.262 --> 1:26:52.798
<i>Mr. Schmeiser did not use
Monsanto's technology</i>

1:26:52.931 --> 1:26:56.134
<i>by spraying his 1998 crop
with Monsanto's Roundup.</i>

1:26:56.268 --> 1:26:59.670
<i>He's not required
to pay the company any damages.</i>

1:26:59.805 --> 1:27:02.473
Hey, Perce,
can I get your autograph?

1:27:03.275 --> 1:27:04.409
No.

1:27:06.845 --> 1:27:08.713
<i>Schmeiser has successfully
defended himself,</i>

1:27:08.847 --> 1:27:10.215
<i>opening more doors
for farmers...</i>

1:27:10.349 --> 1:27:12.084
<i>...the same thing
my family's been doing</i>

1:27:12.217 --> 1:27:13.584
<i>for hundreds of years.</i>

1:27:13.718 --> 1:27:17.089
Say, Al, it's too bad
we're missing the game.

1:27:19.224 --> 1:27:22.961
<i>Percy and Louise Schmeiser
are real people</i>

1:27:23.095 --> 1:27:26.731
<i>and they've been manipulated and
pushed and pulled by all of us.</i>

1:27:26.865 --> 1:27:28.867
<i>But hopefully that's over now</i>

1:27:29.001 --> 1:27:32.170
<i>and they can get back to doing
what really matters to them.</i>

1:27:33.305 --> 1:27:36.274
Your granddaughter wants to be
a farmer just like her granddad.

1:27:36.408 --> 1:27:37.876
How's that sit with you?

1:27:38.877 --> 1:27:41.046
Better her than me.

1:27:41.179 --> 1:27:44.648
We can start her
on the combine next year.

1:28:52.884 --> 1:28:55.387
Louise.

1:28:56.221 --> 1:28:59.723
I'm so sorry
about everything.

1:29:16.475 --> 1:29:17.876
Here, I got this, Perce.

1:29:18.009 --> 1:29:20.779
It's okay.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1:29:24.049 --> 1:29:25.984
I'm sorry it came to this.

1:29:27.185 --> 1:29:28.920
I know how much
they mean to you.

1:29:29.054 --> 1:29:32.991
That's the thing about seed.
You can always grow more.

1:30:07.759 --> 1:30:10.996
Percy, look who
the cat brought in.

1:30:19.905 --> 1:30:21.239
You were right.

1:30:21.373 --> 1:30:24.376
They were looking for a case
to test their patent

1:30:25.243 --> 1:30:27.179
and I handed it to them
on a plate.

1:30:27.312 --> 1:30:31.583
No. No, Percy,
you stopped wheat.

1:30:31.715 --> 1:30:33.518
What kinda BS
you talking about now?

1:30:33.652 --> 1:30:37.589
I deserve that, I do.
But it's true.

1:30:37.721 --> 1:30:40.358
Monsanto announced it
this morning.

1:30:40.492 --> 1:30:43.828
We always knew that Europe
didn't want GMO wheat.

1:30:43.962 --> 1:30:46.631
But now the Canadian farmers,
they heard your story

1:30:46.765 --> 1:30:49.267
and they want nothing to do
with it, they won't grow it.

1:30:49.401 --> 1:30:52.736
So, the Americans know that if
they grow it and you guys don't,

1:30:52.871 --> 1:30:55.540
they can't sell their crops
internationally.

1:30:55.674 --> 1:30:57.542
Isn't it wonderful, Percy?

1:30:59.044 --> 1:31:02.847
Think of all the farmers who won't
have to go through what you did.

1:31:02.981 --> 1:31:05.584
Good for them, not me.

1:31:05.716 --> 1:31:08.620
Percy...
Percy, this is huge.

1:31:08.752 --> 1:31:11.056
You turned the tide.

1:31:11.189 --> 1:31:13.825
The farmers know
they can fight back now.

1:31:16.995 --> 1:31:19.030
You should be really proud.

1:31:31.243 --> 1:31:32.777
Bye, Louise.

1:31:38.250 --> 1:31:39.517
Bye.

1:32:12.183 --> 1:32:13.685
When I take over the farm,

1:32:13.818 --> 1:32:15.954
this is all
gonna be strawberries

1:32:16.087 --> 1:32:18.323
as far as the eye can see.

1:32:18.456 --> 1:32:19.658
- You think?
- Yup.

1:32:28.066 --> 1:32:29.601
Maybe then we can retire.
