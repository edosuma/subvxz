00:00.032 --> 00:01.799
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:01.804 --> 00:04.206
When we land Jaguar,
the world will know.

00:04.309 --> 00:06.715
Herb Rennet has demanded
to spend a night with Joan.

00:06.888 --> 00:08.432
This is some very
dirty business.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.074
I wanted to tell you
it's not worth it.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.820
Tell them I want a partnership.
Not silent.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.345
I want all the partners here.

00:17.502 --> 00:20.532
First thing tomorrow morning we're going
to find you an apartment in the city.

00:20.635 --> 00:23.395
- I need you right now.
- Megan...

00:23.576 --> 00:25.413
It's the only thing
I'm good for.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.248
<i>I think she just...</i>
needed her mother.

00:28.353 --> 00:31.643
I'm tired of trying to prove
I still have a value around here.

00:31.749 --> 00:33.646
It's what happens when
you help someone...

00:33.885 --> 00:35.233
they succeed and move on.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.863
Don't you want them to?

00:39.069 --> 00:40.792
Miss Calvet, could you
step in, please?

00:40.935 --> 00:42.648
You know I love you.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.515
Are you alone?

That's it.

01:26.241 --> 01:29.109
- That's it, hang in there.
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

01:30.829 --> 01:32.980
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:33.014 --> 01:36.317
<i>"Midway in our life's journey,</i>

01:36.351 --> 01:39.119
<i>I went astray</i>
<i>from the straight road</i>

01:39.154 --> 01:42.289
<i>and woke to find myself alone</i>

01:42.324 --> 01:44.758
<i>in a dark wood."</i>

01:50.415 --> 01:52.416
Mmm.

01:52.450 --> 01:55.069
Mahalo.

01:55.103 --> 01:57.271
It's still suite 282.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.862
How long has it been?

02:04.913 --> 02:07.748
Can't get too suntanned,
they'll fire me.

02:13.722 --> 02:16.974
Oh, you must have
gotten it wet.

02:17.025 --> 02:18.609
Let me see.

02:18.643 --> 02:22.796
You know what?
Who cares what time it is?

02:35.076 --> 02:37.378
You would not have liked that.

02:37.412 --> 02:38.946
You wouldn't have
liked it at all.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.382
I had to walk down the beach
away from the crowds

02:41.416 --> 02:43.851
to this surf shop and knock
on a door with a closed sign.

02:43.885 --> 02:45.853
It was so seedy down there.

02:45.887 --> 02:49.640
Plus, I had to get
my money from here.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.668
Come on.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.753
I know you've tried it,
but you haven't had sex high.

03:02.787 --> 03:05.222
It makes it so much
more intense.

03:50.018 --> 03:53.237
Everything you see on your
plate is what you would find

03:53.271 --> 03:54.855
in a royal Hawaiian feast.

03:54.889 --> 03:57.624
<i>That purple pudding is poi.</i>

03:57.659 --> 04:00.827
<i>It's strange, but satisfying.</i>

04:00.845 --> 04:03.681
And we Hawaiians
say that it's <i>ono,</i>

04:03.715 --> 04:05.683
<i>which means tasty.</i>

04:05.734 --> 04:09.820
But you might just say,
"Ono, I'm not eating that."

04:12.157 --> 04:14.324
This is real Hawaiian food.

04:14.376 --> 04:16.125
Even the macaroni salad.

04:16.161 --> 04:18.545
But, of course,
at the Royal Hawaiian,

04:18.579 --> 04:20.613
we try to treat
every guest like they're--

04:20.648 --> 04:22.383
Well, everything
is better here.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.084
I'm sure it is.

04:24.102 --> 04:26.437
It must take a lot of work
to stand out in paradise.

04:26.488 --> 04:28.188
Don, you have to try this.

04:28.223 --> 04:29.890
Oh, don't bother.
It's wallpaper paste.

04:29.924 --> 04:31.825
Just eat the pig.

04:31.859 --> 04:34.828
<i>Now, while you stay
with us at the lovely,</i>

04:34.863 --> 04:36.663
<i>beautiful Royal Hawaiian,</i>

04:36.698 --> 04:40.000
make sure you see
enchanted Diamond Head

04:40.035 --> 04:42.770
and all of the natural
wonders of the island

04:42.804 --> 04:44.304
by bus or by boat.

04:44.339 --> 04:46.673
<i>It's easy if you book</i>

04:46.708 --> 04:49.793
<i>one of our guided tours</i>
<i>in the lobby.</i>

04:54.416 --> 04:56.216
Aloha.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.418
Come. Come dance.

04:58.436 --> 04:59.853
I've got nothing
to do with this.

04:59.888 --> 05:02.056
Go ahead, Don.

05:02.090 --> 05:03.557
Leave him alone, honey.

05:03.575 --> 05:05.959
I want to do it.

05:21.910 --> 05:25.312
No, you have to
do it like this.

05:25.330 --> 05:27.498
You have to relax.

05:27.532 --> 05:30.501
Get in the spirit
of the islands.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.190
They call me
the Hawaiian Elvis.

05:37.659 --> 05:40.294
Gentlemen, I remind you,

05:40.328 --> 05:42.246
this is my job.

05:48.937 --> 05:51.522
Stop laughing or I'll make
them come back for you.

05:53.174 --> 05:55.692
Excuse me, Corinne.
I hate to bother you.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.661
I mean, I know
your name's not Corinne.

05:57.695 --> 06:00.614
No, It's Megan Calvet.

06:00.632 --> 06:03.917
- Oh, my goodness. I'm really
bothering you. - No, not at all.

06:03.951 --> 06:06.453
<i>You're so much trimmer than you are on TV.
Do people tell you that?</i>

06:06.488 --> 06:10.124
- I-- no.
- "To Have and to Hold" is my favorite.

06:10.158 --> 06:13.059
I mean, I watch a few, and
you're obviously on vacation.

06:13.077 --> 06:15.913
- It's okay. - Well, I know you're
new to "Berkshire Falls,"

06:15.947 --> 06:19.366
but I can tell you--
you just have a way.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.251
Thank you so much.

06:21.302 --> 06:23.637
Would you mind signing
an autograph to my niece?

06:23.671 --> 06:25.689
She's a bigger fan than I am.

06:25.723 --> 06:28.108
I'd be delighted.

06:36.317 --> 06:38.635
- What's her name?
- Karen.

06:38.670 --> 06:40.354
It's like Corinne.

06:40.388 --> 06:43.757
I can't believe
Victor won't acknowledge you.

06:43.775 --> 06:46.560
Well, we'll see what happens.

06:46.594 --> 06:48.912
<i>Enjoy your stay.</i>

07:07.315 --> 07:09.449
Those women really knew me.

07:09.484 --> 07:11.351
One of them was from Minnesota.

07:11.386 --> 07:13.887
I didn't even know
they had the show there.

07:27.302 --> 07:29.269
I love it here.

07:56.731 --> 07:59.232
Hey, Galloway,
you want another?

07:59.250 --> 08:01.868
Can I get a tall beer?
Chop chop.

08:04.455 --> 08:07.241
So, mister,
has he moved at all?

08:09.010 --> 08:12.863
Well, you're either dead
or you've got great balance.

08:14.182 --> 08:16.833
Hey, were you in the service?

08:18.202 --> 08:19.653
I got the same one.

08:28.696 --> 08:31.398
- What branch?
- Army.

08:31.432 --> 08:33.116
You can say that again.

08:33.167 --> 08:35.235
- Korea?
- Briefly.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.571
Was Korea like this?

08:37.605 --> 08:40.924
'Cause I'll tell you, they
offer you R&R in Honolulu

08:40.975 --> 08:44.678
and you think, "Did anybody
notice it's the same place?"

08:44.712 --> 08:47.781
<i>But I'm glad to be here,</i>
<i>I can tell you that.</i>

08:47.815 --> 08:50.033
You on your anniversary?

08:51.586 --> 08:53.787
Folks have been
pretty friendly.

08:53.821 --> 08:56.990
After all the shit that went
on last summer Stateside,

08:57.025 --> 08:59.226
I was looking for a fight.

08:59.260 --> 09:04.431
That'd be classy-- showing
up with a black eye.

09:04.465 --> 09:06.633
This is my bachelor party.

09:06.668 --> 09:09.436
I'm getting married tomorrow.

09:10.938 --> 09:12.839
Congratulations.
Let me buy you a drink.

09:12.873 --> 09:15.559
Nah, I got a shitload
of combat pay.

09:15.593 --> 09:17.477
Let me buy you one.

09:17.512 --> 09:20.380
You some kind of astronaut?

09:20.415 --> 09:21.982
I'm in advertising.

09:22.016 --> 09:25.519
We got this .50 caliber
machine gun.

09:25.553 --> 09:27.487
The M2.

09:29.173 --> 09:31.791
You should see what it does
to a water buffalo.

09:31.809 --> 09:35.395
Oh, my Lord. I could
paint this place red.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.130
How long do you have left?

09:37.165 --> 09:39.533
Ceremony's at 0800.

09:39.567 --> 09:42.285
Four hours or so.

09:42.337 --> 09:45.038
No, in Vietnam.

09:45.072 --> 09:46.573
Eight months.

09:46.591 --> 09:49.142
Someone told her
married guys live longer

09:49.177 --> 09:51.645
'cause they got
something to live for.

09:51.679 --> 09:54.881
She's from San Diego.

09:54.916 --> 09:57.050
She's Mexican.

09:58.386 --> 10:00.921
She met me halfway in Hawaii.

10:00.955 --> 10:03.590
I met her halfway
by getting married.

10:03.624 --> 10:06.292
Were you married
when you were in Korea?

10:06.310 --> 10:07.494
No.

10:07.528 --> 10:09.279
And you made it.

10:09.313 --> 10:12.098
Listen, Lieutenant.

10:12.116 --> 10:15.001
What do you say
we get into some trouble?

10:16.587 --> 10:18.738
It's PFC Dinkins, by the way.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.175
It's usually
printed right there.

10:22.209 --> 10:23.677
Don.

10:25.513 --> 10:28.448
So how do you feel
about giving away the bride?

10:28.483 --> 10:30.167
You don't think your
friend's gonna make it?

10:30.201 --> 10:33.003
Nah, he's my best man.

10:33.037 --> 10:35.321
Her family's in San Ysidro.

10:35.339 --> 10:40.093
And I don't want some hotel
employee being her dad.

10:41.362 --> 10:43.697
They look just like the enemy.

10:43.731 --> 10:45.899
Am I wrong?

10:45.933 --> 10:48.935
There's plenty of GIs here.
There's no one else you know?

10:48.970 --> 10:51.104
Who gave your bride away?

10:51.139 --> 10:54.641
I'd love to help you out,
but you don't even know me.

10:54.675 --> 10:56.176
I think you'd regret it later.

10:56.210 --> 10:59.196
I believe in what
goes around comes around.

11:00.815 --> 11:03.349
One day I'm gonna be
a veteran in paradise.

11:03.367 --> 11:06.186
One day I'll be the man
who can't sleep

11:06.220 --> 11:08.989
and talks to strangers.

11:51.765 --> 11:55.335
<i>I, James, take you, Connie,</i>
<i>for my lawful wife,</i>

11:55.369 --> 11:58.572
to have and to hold
from this day forward.

11:58.606 --> 12:01.374
For better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer,

12:01.409 --> 12:03.510
in sickness and in health,

12:03.528 --> 12:05.028
<i>until death do us part.</i>

12:32.156 --> 12:34.667
What were you doing wrong?

12:35.676 --> 12:38.645
I'm so sorry, Officer.
It's very hard to see.

12:38.679 --> 12:41.381
That's why you
have to drive slower.

12:41.415 --> 12:44.084
<i>We go easy on the speed limit
here, but not with this ice.</i>

12:44.118 --> 12:45.719
I promise I will do that
in the future.

12:45.753 --> 12:47.621
I'm afraid this is about
what you already did.

12:47.655 --> 12:50.690
You may not be aware,
but this is Betty Francis.

12:50.725 --> 12:53.393
You may know her husband,
my son, Henry Francis.

12:53.427 --> 12:56.563
He works in the mayor's office in Manhattan.
Mayor Lindsay.

12:56.597 --> 12:59.833
I work for New York State.
We've got our own mayor.

12:59.867 --> 13:02.068
I'll do without
your sarcasm, young man.

13:02.103 --> 13:04.337
Now, if you don't mind,

13:04.372 --> 13:06.606
I think all concerned
will be very content

13:06.641 --> 13:09.609
if you issue a stern warning
and let us be on our way.

13:09.644 --> 13:11.645
Pauline.

13:11.679 --> 13:14.114
I'm trying to avoid taking you
off the road with a shovel.

13:14.148 --> 13:16.416
She's driving like a maniac.

13:16.450 --> 13:18.134
Yell at her.

13:20.972 --> 13:22.789
I hate cops.

13:22.807 --> 13:24.824
Nonsense. They're just
doing their job.

13:24.859 --> 13:26.927
Well, they're too enthusiastic.

13:26.961 --> 13:29.763
That ruined it.
That ruined everything.

13:29.797 --> 13:32.365
I can't imagine it getting
any darker than this.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.134
My mom's dead.

13:44.211 --> 13:46.179
How was "The Nutcracker"?

13:46.213 --> 13:48.765
- The highlight of the evening.
- Magical as always.

13:48.799 --> 13:52.185
Well, Bobby, Gene, and I
are sorry we missed it.

13:52.219 --> 13:54.854
Nothing like the ballet,
right, boys?

13:54.888 --> 13:56.823
Is Sandy sleeping over?

13:56.857 --> 13:58.891
What do you care?

14:05.499 --> 14:08.335
Isn't somebody
going to say something?

14:09.637 --> 14:11.688
Betty got a ticket.

14:11.739 --> 14:13.490
For what?

14:13.524 --> 14:16.326
I thought it was
going to be speeding,

14:16.360 --> 14:18.828
but apparently
it's reckless driving.

14:18.863 --> 14:21.298
I want you to tell your wife

14:21.332 --> 14:23.967
that invoking your name in an
interaction with a state trooper

14:24.001 --> 14:25.451
is nothing to be ashamed of.

14:25.469 --> 14:27.420
Ma, it barely works for me.

14:27.454 --> 14:29.639
Then Grandma Pauline
yelled at him.

14:29.674 --> 14:32.659
- I did nothing of the sort.
- What did he do?

14:32.693 --> 14:35.278
- He was verbally abusive.
- Give him the ticket.

14:35.313 --> 14:36.929
He'll fix it.
He does it for everyone.

14:36.947 --> 14:38.898
Ma, you know how I fix
those tickets?

14:38.933 --> 14:40.433
I pay 'em.

14:40.468 --> 14:42.702
- Can I open it?
- Mm-hmm.

14:42.736 --> 14:44.671
Get away, you little weirdo.

14:44.705 --> 14:47.874
I like the case.
It looks like a coffin.

14:47.908 --> 14:50.593
Would you play a little?
That'd be nice.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.445
I don't know.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.849
Please. It makes
me feel so much.

14:57.435 --> 15:00.654
This is disgusting.
Don't let them force you.

15:00.688 --> 15:02.489
Have you been playing long?

15:02.523 --> 15:06.126
- She's going to Juilliard next semester.
- Juilliard?

15:06.160 --> 15:09.362
Why didn't you tell me we were
in the presence of a prodigy?

15:09.397 --> 15:11.698
15 is not a prodigy.

16:08.038 --> 16:10.356
Sorry about that.
Checking the steam.

16:10.374 --> 16:12.859
- How was your trip?
- Wonderful.

16:12.877 --> 16:15.095
Warm.
I did not miss this.

16:15.129 --> 16:17.297
How are you feeling?

16:21.018 --> 16:23.653
Let me in there.

16:23.687 --> 16:25.989
<i>It's okay, Jonesy.</i>

16:26.023 --> 16:28.775
- Jesus, what's his real name?
- I don't know.

16:31.545 --> 16:34.748
Open his coat.
Open his coat.

16:34.782 --> 16:36.633
Sylvia, call an ambulance.

16:38.586 --> 16:40.503
There's a phone at the desk.

16:42.256 --> 16:44.724
Okay, Jonesy,
keep listening to me.

16:44.759 --> 16:46.826
Come on,
I know you can hear me.

16:46.861 --> 16:49.796
<i>Come on.</i>

16:49.830 --> 16:51.948
Let me get those.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.200
- Absolutely not.
- I'm surprised you're back at work.

16:54.234 --> 16:56.068
Oh, the missus couldn't wait
to get me out of the house.

16:56.086 --> 16:58.705
- I don't believe it.
- Oh, wait.

16:58.739 --> 17:01.508
Messenger came with
your script yesterday.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.376
I didn't let it
out of my sight.

17:03.394 --> 17:05.979
I got you a pretty nice
bottle for Christmas

17:06.012 --> 17:07.730
in case you can't
read the handwriting.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.016
Well, I hope you got
Dr. Rosen a case.

17:17.088 --> 17:19.589
I thought you were going to
stop reading that before bed.

17:19.624 --> 17:21.406
It's not bothering me tonight.

17:21.425 --> 17:23.542
I bet it isn't.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.180
You're so calm
from all that violin.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.282
She plays beautifully.

17:29.317 --> 17:32.052
You and Bobby had the same look on
your face when she was playing.

17:32.086 --> 17:34.421
She's a year older than Sally.
Shame on you.

17:34.455 --> 17:37.624
No one would blame me for leaving
you for a teenage musician.

17:37.658 --> 17:39.693
She's just in the next room.

17:39.727 --> 17:42.162
Why don't you go in there
and rape her?

17:42.196 --> 17:44.731
- I'll hold her arms down.
- Betty, what the hell?

17:44.765 --> 17:47.033
You said you wanted
to spice things up.

17:47.068 --> 17:49.402
Will it ruin it if I'm there?

17:49.437 --> 17:51.304
You know what? If you want
to be alone with her,

17:51.339 --> 17:53.840
I'll put on my housecoat
and take Sally for a ride.

17:53.874 --> 17:56.343
You can stick a rag in her mouth
and you won't wake the boys.

17:56.377 --> 17:58.311
All right.
All right, Betty.

17:59.547 --> 18:02.448
My goodness.
You're blushing.

18:08.489 --> 18:10.440
She left the sliding door open.

18:10.474 --> 18:12.309
There's dirt all over the rug.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.260
Maybe she wanted
to air out the place.

18:14.278 --> 18:16.946
I'm gonna take the cleaning
out of her Christmas present.

18:16.981 --> 18:19.032
One scene.

18:19.066 --> 18:22.736
I take somebody's coat
and offer them a drink.

18:22.770 --> 18:25.672
You're the maid.
It's more than ours does.

18:25.706 --> 18:28.925
One scene, Don. They send
me to pack suitcases.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.910
Yours or theirs?

18:30.945 --> 18:33.013
Victor's.

18:34.398 --> 18:36.016
Then I'd be worried
if I was Victor.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.552
I shouldn't have gone
on vacation.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.876
What are you doing up?

18:46.927 --> 18:50.130
I couldn't sleep. I didn't
want to wake Sally,

18:50.164 --> 18:52.432
although you have
the creakiest floor.

18:52.466 --> 18:56.069
It's an old house.
At least turn on a light.

18:58.072 --> 19:00.023
Are you hungry?

19:00.074 --> 19:02.275
Are you gonna have something?

19:03.644 --> 19:05.145
Yes,

19:05.179 --> 19:07.280
but I really have to be
careful this time of year.

19:07.298 --> 19:09.215
Why?

19:09.250 --> 19:11.217
I'm trying to reduce.

19:11.252 --> 19:15.055
Why don't you just be the way you are?
You're beautiful.

19:15.089 --> 19:18.091
That's charming
and you know it.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.765
My mother wore
a girdle all the time

19:25.800 --> 19:28.334
and she always had a stomachache
and I always thought,

19:28.369 --> 19:31.838
"You'd rather have a stomachache
just so Dad will like you?"

19:31.872 --> 19:35.108
Sandy,

19:35.142 --> 19:37.844
my mother passed away
a few years ago

19:37.878 --> 19:39.913
and I understand.

19:39.947 --> 19:42.782
This time of year
is the hardest.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.986
Oh, dear.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.490
We're happy to include
you in our family.

19:50.524 --> 19:53.326
I can't go to Juilliard.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.495
I know how you're feeling.

19:55.529 --> 19:58.164
I was older than you,
but I remember

19:58.199 --> 20:00.366
when I went to Bryn Mawr,
I was terrified.

20:00.401 --> 20:02.335
- But then the minute I--
- No.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.105
I didn't get in.

20:05.139 --> 20:07.140
They rejected me.

20:08.442 --> 20:10.610
Oh.

20:13.681 --> 20:15.715
Of course you'd lie about that.

20:18.152 --> 20:20.286
So you'll try again next year.

20:20.321 --> 20:23.590
Tell everyone you wanted
to finish high school.

20:25.259 --> 20:28.762
It's incredible how fast
some people come up with lies.

20:28.796 --> 20:31.197
Please don't do that.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.001
I'm old for a violinist.

20:35.035 --> 20:37.070
At least for one
as good as I am.

20:37.104 --> 20:40.640
I don't care. All I wanted
to do was go to New York.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.975
In a few years.

20:42.009 --> 20:43.843
But it'll be too late.

20:43.878 --> 20:46.045
My feet are already
in wet cement.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.549
Plenty of girls do just
fine without Juilliard.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.752
Sure, you go to college,

20:52.787 --> 20:55.588
you meet a boy, you drop out,

20:55.623 --> 20:57.690
you get married,

20:57.725 --> 21:00.760
struggle for a year in New York
while he learns to tie a tie,

21:00.795 --> 21:04.280
and then move to the country and
just start the whole disaster over.

21:04.315 --> 21:07.433
That's an arrogant
exaggeration.

21:07.451 --> 21:09.319
You have so much.

21:09.370 --> 21:11.371
I didn't ask for it
and I don't need it.

21:11.405 --> 21:13.289
You don't need it?

21:13.324 --> 21:15.107
Do you know what
it's like to have nothing?

21:15.125 --> 21:17.877
- Do you?
- Why do you keep insulting me?

21:17.912 --> 21:19.412
I'm trying to help.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.564
No, aren't you curious?

21:21.599 --> 21:23.516
There are people
in the Village.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.518
I read about it
and I even visited them.

21:25.552 --> 21:28.154
You went to the city alone?
Did Sally go with you?

21:28.189 --> 21:30.156
No.

21:30.191 --> 21:32.158
But she told me you went.

21:32.192 --> 21:33.710
That you were a model.

21:33.744 --> 21:35.545
Yes.

21:35.579 --> 21:37.831
And I lived with
five girls in two rooms

21:37.865 --> 21:39.499
and ate soup out of cans.

21:39.533 --> 21:41.267
It's not glamorous.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.637
But I bet it was great.

21:44.672 --> 21:47.674
It was different back then.

21:47.708 --> 21:50.510
There weren't all
the riots and robberies.

21:50.544 --> 21:51.678
Do you watch the news?

21:51.712 --> 21:54.113
I visited this building

21:54.148 --> 21:56.416
right off St. Mark's Place.

21:56.450 --> 21:59.419
And the kids are just
living and it's beautiful.

21:59.453 --> 22:01.321
You know?

22:01.355 --> 22:04.307
People are naturally democratic
if you give them a chance.

22:04.358 --> 22:06.592
Are you on dope?

22:06.610 --> 22:08.094
No.

22:08.112 --> 22:10.530
- But--
- But...

22:10.564 --> 22:13.700
you're going to wait until you're
old enough to live on your own.

22:13.734 --> 22:15.268
It's two years.

22:15.302 --> 22:17.270
Hardly a jail sentence.

22:19.039 --> 22:20.540
You know, you're not my child,

22:20.574 --> 22:22.442
so there's no reason
for me to say this,

22:22.476 --> 22:24.444
but I go to the symphony
quite a bit,

22:24.478 --> 22:26.379
whether I like it or not,

22:26.413 --> 22:30.383
and I am certain
that you are talented.

22:32.553 --> 22:34.354
And on the bright side,

22:34.388 --> 22:36.823
Sally was crushed
you were going away.

22:43.330 --> 22:45.198
Want to use the bathroom?

22:45.232 --> 22:47.884
- I think I'm feeling better.
- I'm not.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.472
- There's Pepto-Bismol.
- I think it's too late.

22:54.174 --> 22:56.342
I don't like vegetarian food.

22:56.377 --> 22:58.611
Reminds me of Lent.

22:58.646 --> 23:00.780
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>It's a punishment.</i>

23:04.385 --> 23:06.753
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

23:06.787 --> 23:08.388
This is Peggy.
Who is this?

23:08.422 --> 23:10.773
- Did you watch Carson?
- Who is this?

23:10.808 --> 23:13.559
It's Burt.
Burt Peterson.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.362
Oh.
Is everything okay?

23:16.397 --> 23:20.133
I'm calling you at midnight.
We're screwed, Peggy.

23:20.167 --> 23:23.369
We're at DEFCON 3. We're
about to go to DEFCON 4.

23:23.404 --> 23:25.738
DEFCON 4 is better
than DEFCON 3.

23:25.773 --> 23:27.941
I've told you that.
One is the worst.

23:27.975 --> 23:30.443
- Then we're at zero.
- There is no zero.

23:30.477 --> 23:34.414
Some comic on Carson was breaking everybody
up with this routine about the war.

23:34.448 --> 23:38.084
Burt, it's very late and you
sound a little under the weather

23:38.118 --> 23:40.653
and there's such a thing
as free speech in this country.

23:40.688 --> 23:44.190
I could give a hoot. Koss Headphones
wants to pull our Super Bowl spot.

23:44.224 --> 23:46.693
<i>He hates the line now.</i>

23:46.727 --> 23:50.029
"Lend me your ears"?
It's Shakespeare.

23:50.064 --> 23:52.665
Well, it's somehow related
to something.

23:52.700 --> 23:55.001
<i>The president.</i>
<i>I don't know. I didn't see it.</i>

23:56.020 --> 23:57.804
<i>You there?</i>

23:57.838 --> 23:59.472
Yes.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.674
<i>So you got to change your ad.</i>

24:01.709 --> 24:04.610
- Now it's my ad?
- <i>He wants to meet for a discussion.</i>

24:04.644 --> 24:07.163
- About what?
- I don't know. Something bad.

24:07.197 --> 24:08.948
I take the client's
word for it.

24:08.982 --> 24:10.950
- You've got to call Ted.
- About what?

24:10.984 --> 24:12.618
I don't even know
what the problem is.

24:12.653 --> 24:15.421
It's better coming from you.
I've got to go.

24:25.766 --> 24:28.234
What time is it in Colorado?

24:28.268 --> 24:31.571
<i>I don't know. I can't
do any math right now.</i>

24:31.605 --> 24:32.889
<i>I can't do any math at all.</i>

24:32.923 --> 24:35.224
Please, honey, don't talk.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.764
Morning.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.400
I guess I don't say
Merry Christmas to you.

24:44.435 --> 24:48.071
Save that for Sylvia.
How was Hawaii?

24:48.105 --> 24:50.089
Long ago and far away.

24:50.124 --> 24:52.224
What's that camera
you guys are selling?

24:52.242 --> 24:53.860
- Pentax?
- Leica.

24:53.894 --> 24:57.063
And which model
will change my life?

24:57.081 --> 24:59.782
Like everybody else, I only
know them by the price.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.951
You know what?

25:02.002 --> 25:03.836
Come by.

25:03.871 --> 25:06.839
I got a closetful.
I'll give you one.

25:06.874 --> 25:08.508
Come on.
I'll pay for it.

25:08.542 --> 25:10.409
I'd give one
to Christiaan Barnard.

25:10.427 --> 25:11.878
I might just come by.

25:11.912 --> 25:14.197
You owe me just for
that comment alone.

25:14.248 --> 25:16.148
- You can come by right now.
- No.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.334
I'm gonna be in surgery till 2:00.
Maybe after.

25:18.368 --> 25:21.921
Remember, you come by my
office, I get to go to yours.

25:23.674 --> 25:26.426
<i>Another glorious
morning, Dr. Rosen.</i>

25:26.460 --> 25:29.345
No good deed...

25:29.396 --> 25:31.064
I don't know.

25:31.098 --> 25:33.566
Probably part of
a deeper question.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.170
Because, I mean, none of them are
really blonde anyway, right?

25:37.204 --> 25:39.338
She's 29 years old.

25:39.373 --> 25:42.542
Hair darkens by that age,
so she's probably a brunette.

25:42.576 --> 25:45.094
Maybe she does
remind me of Jane.

25:45.129 --> 25:47.880
No, I think it's more
than just distraction.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.082
I think you're being
hard on me.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.351
You used the word
"distraction."

25:52.386 --> 25:55.204
Did I?
Well, I need a vacation.

25:55.239 --> 25:58.040
I'm busy.
I'm a busy man.

25:58.075 --> 26:00.543
I walk around that place,
people say "Good morning" to me.

26:00.577 --> 26:02.879
They don't really care. They
don't know anything about me.

26:02.913 --> 26:06.499
Oh, God, Doc,
what is it all about?

26:06.533 --> 26:08.434
Help me.

26:10.170 --> 26:12.238
I say--
I say that's a joke, son.

26:12.272 --> 26:14.824
- We discussed this.
- What?

26:14.858 --> 26:16.709
I can't laugh
at everything you say.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.511
Either it's funny or it's not.

26:18.545 --> 26:20.213
I don't know how
you can control yourself.

26:20.247 --> 26:23.583
It's hard sometimes.
We talked about that, too.

26:23.617 --> 26:25.985
What exactly
are you joking about?

26:26.019 --> 26:29.088
You're obviously not afraid
that you're boring.

26:29.123 --> 26:31.224
What are the events in life?

26:31.258 --> 26:33.259
It's like you see a door.

26:33.293 --> 26:35.261
The first time you come
to it you say,

26:35.295 --> 26:38.064
"Oh, what's on the other
side of the door?"

26:38.098 --> 26:40.099
Then you open a few doors.

26:40.134 --> 26:42.235
Then you say, "I think I want to
go over that bridge this time.

26:42.269 --> 26:45.304
I'm tired of doors." Finally you
go through one of these things

26:45.339 --> 26:47.590
and you come out the other side and
you realize that's all there are--

26:47.641 --> 26:51.060
doors and windows
and bridges and gates.

26:51.094 --> 26:53.379
And they all open the same way

26:53.397 --> 26:55.815
and they all close behind you.

26:58.018 --> 27:00.419
Look, life is supposed
to be a path and you go along

27:00.454 --> 27:02.988
and these things happen to you and
they're supposed to change you.

27:03.006 --> 27:06.709
Change your direction. But it
turns out that's not true.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.662
It turns out the experiences
are nothing.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.732
They're just some pennies
you pick up off the floor,

27:12.766 --> 27:15.134
stick in your pocket, and you're
just going in a straight line

27:15.152 --> 27:17.186
to you-know-where.

27:17.237 --> 27:18.771
You sound afraid.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.273
More like irritated.

27:20.307 --> 27:22.275
And what do you think
is causing that?

27:22.309 --> 27:24.310
Top of the list, New Year's.

27:24.344 --> 27:26.412
It's like an extra birthday.

27:26.446 --> 27:28.347
You're supposed to blow out the
candle and wish for something.

27:28.382 --> 27:30.967
I don't even know what it is.

27:33.487 --> 27:35.321
How was your Christmas?

27:35.355 --> 27:37.773
Same as the last five--
ruined by work.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.526
- How was yours?
- I'm a widower, Peggy.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.945
Oh. I'm sorry.

27:45.566 --> 27:48.918
Apparently there was a bunch
of jokes on the "Tonight Show,"

27:48.969 --> 27:53.723
in question, about soldiers
cutting off ears in Vietnam.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.943
And obviously we are gonna have
to go in another direction.

27:57.111 --> 27:59.111
_

27:59.112 --> 28:00.580
What did they say?

28:00.614 --> 28:02.248
Well, I wasn't able

28:02.282 --> 28:03.983
to obtain a copy
or a transcript,

28:04.001 --> 28:06.502
but Lawrence here
is a devout viewer.

28:06.536 --> 28:08.654
I don't know
if I can do it justice.

28:08.672 --> 28:10.840
Just shut up and do it.

28:14.511 --> 28:18.014
Well, he came out
and started talking about

28:18.065 --> 28:19.932
how that surgeon
in South Africa

28:19.966 --> 28:22.301
transplanted a heart.
And he says,

28:22.336 --> 28:25.788
"Now I know what I'm getting
President Johnson for Christmas."

28:25.822 --> 28:28.474
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Lawrence.

28:28.508 --> 28:31.177
- No, the comedian.
- We're finding that out.

28:31.211 --> 28:34.313
- You have no information.
- We know the host was Phyllis Diller.

28:35.315 --> 28:36.716
Get to the ears.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.602
Well, I don't remember
how he got to it,

28:39.636 --> 28:41.721
but it was something about how

28:41.755 --> 28:44.106
the first transplants
they did were with dogs.

28:44.157 --> 28:47.576
So obviously there could be some
sort of mix-up or something.

28:47.611 --> 28:51.113
Dad's better, but he goes nuts
every time we run the can opener.

28:51.164 --> 28:54.834
He hates the mailman or something.

28:54.868 --> 28:59.055
And, oh, he keeps
ruining the carpet.

28:59.089 --> 29:02.375
Only thing that stops him is hitting him
on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.

29:03.677 --> 29:06.379
Do you remember
the ear joke or not?

29:06.413 --> 29:09.498
Well, he went back
to Christmas.

29:09.533 --> 29:11.984
Did you hear about
how there are these GIs

29:12.002 --> 29:13.836
with interesting decorations?

29:13.870 --> 29:15.821
'Cause they cut off
the Vietcong's ears

29:15.839 --> 29:18.524
and wore them on a string around
their neck like a trophy.

29:18.558 --> 29:20.926
Oh.
They really did that?

29:20.961 --> 29:22.428
There's a court-martial.

29:22.462 --> 29:24.630
Did he actually say
"Vietcong" on Carson?

29:24.665 --> 29:27.433
I don't remember.
This is the best I can do.

29:27.451 --> 29:29.919
- I think you're very good.
- You think so?

29:29.953 --> 29:32.571
So, was that it?

29:32.589 --> 29:34.957
No.
The big laugh was

29:35.008 --> 29:36.676
a general comes up
to one of these guys

29:36.710 --> 29:39.295
and says, "That's not
regulation, son."

29:39.346 --> 29:42.598
The soldier says, "Pardon? Could
you speak into my necklace?"

29:46.119 --> 29:49.238
Biggest laugh even though the
transplant jokes were better.

29:49.272 --> 29:52.024
That's not even funny.
What did Phyllis do?

29:52.058 --> 29:54.110
She just said something like,

29:54.161 --> 29:56.162
"I told you he was
a sick puppy."

29:56.196 --> 29:58.748
When is Koss coming in?

29:58.799 --> 30:00.716
1:00.
Should I order lunch?

30:00.751 --> 30:02.218
He loves the Russian Tea Room.

30:02.252 --> 30:03.719
No, this is
an emergency meeting.

30:03.754 --> 30:05.554
I should probably
practice a little more.

30:05.605 --> 30:07.373
The client's already seen it.

30:08.608 --> 30:11.010
Go home.
There's no second show.

30:15.082 --> 30:17.850
- What did Ted say?
- I left a message.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.385
I don't think
there's anything to do

30:19.419 --> 30:21.887
but work our way through
100 versions of no.

30:21.922 --> 30:24.123
Listen, don't get
in your own way.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.158
No, I've seen
creatives do this.

30:26.193 --> 30:28.761
I've seen Ted do it.
This is the Super Bowl.

30:28.795 --> 30:31.764
It's a lot of money. A lot
of exposure for the agency.

30:31.798 --> 30:33.599
- There's probably awards down the road.
- I know.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.601
Believe me, I know.

30:35.635 --> 30:37.303
The fucking
"Tonight Show."

30:37.337 --> 30:39.755
Now, Peggy,
I think it's the Army

30:39.790 --> 30:42.074
that's really at fault here.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.916
You look tan.
Did you have fun?

31:04.950 --> 31:07.218
I'm sorry,
but your name escapes me.

31:07.252 --> 31:10.321
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm upstairs in Accounts.

31:10.356 --> 31:12.657
Beloit College, Wharton MBA.

31:12.691 --> 31:15.093
Secor, Mohawk, Life Cereal.

31:15.127 --> 31:17.128
You know,
but just in the outfield.

31:17.162 --> 31:18.930
Yes, of course.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.531
We spoke at
the Christmas party.

31:20.566 --> 31:23.768
You seemed to know your way
around Pennsylvania.

31:23.802 --> 31:26.738
You want one of these?
I get it right next door.

31:26.772 --> 31:30.408
People will take a few extra
steps for a superior product.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.544
Doesn't it belong
to someone else?

31:33.579 --> 31:36.180
No, I always get two.
I don't want to share.

31:39.868 --> 31:42.570
You know, I have through,

31:42.621 --> 31:44.072
let's just say
low-level corruption,

31:44.123 --> 31:46.490
obtained tickets
to the Cotton Bowl.

31:46.508 --> 31:48.876
Crimson Tide versus Texas A&M.

31:51.096 --> 31:52.964
You play football?

31:52.998 --> 31:55.366
- What's in that coffee?
- Excuse me?

31:56.735 --> 31:58.820
Oh.

31:58.854 --> 32:01.939
Look, I've been trying
to get to know your team.

32:01.973 --> 32:05.610
Not that I'm so important. And
they talk about you all the time.

32:05.644 --> 32:08.663
So I guess I figured a few minutes
alone with you shouldn't be wasted.

32:08.714 --> 32:10.498
Just a minute, Bob.

32:12.451 --> 32:14.652
I smell creativity.

32:17.106 --> 32:20.257
I love it down here.

32:20.275 --> 32:23.111
I can't believe you just came off
of 10 hours of plane travel.

32:23.145 --> 32:25.730
- You look great.
- No, Stan, you look great.

32:25.764 --> 32:28.566
Changing the subject
ever so slightly,

32:28.584 --> 32:31.369
during your travels did you
notice if the stewardesses

32:31.403 --> 32:34.105
would let a mother hold a baby
on her lap the whole ride?

32:34.139 --> 32:35.773
I believe so.

32:35.808 --> 32:38.059
- Ha!
- Really?

32:38.093 --> 32:40.044
Don't feel bad. I mean, how would you know?
You never had any kids.

32:40.062 --> 32:42.096
Last time you left town,
it was in a covered wagon.

32:42.147 --> 32:44.849
Because you're old.

32:44.883 --> 32:47.368
You're so tan.

32:47.402 --> 32:50.020
- So how was the vacation?
- He was on assignment.

32:50.038 --> 32:53.157
On Waikiki Beach. How much work
do you think you got done?

32:53.192 --> 32:57.128
Look at him. He has the
sea breeze in his hair.

32:57.162 --> 32:59.297
You bring me something?
Huh?

32:59.331 --> 33:01.966
Dictaphone, cocktail napkins?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.735
Anything to give me a jump
on the Royal Hawaiian?

33:04.770 --> 33:07.839
I had an experience.

33:07.873 --> 33:10.274
I don't know how
to put it into words.

33:13.979 --> 33:16.631
Isn't Sheraton
coming in on Friday?

33:16.665 --> 33:18.800
He's still thinking.
He just got back.

33:18.834 --> 33:21.469
I'll tell you the experience.

33:22.721 --> 33:24.655
Megan in a bikini.

33:29.778 --> 33:31.979
Oh, Mr. Draper.
There you are.

33:32.030 --> 33:33.764
Good morning.
How was your trip?

33:33.799 --> 33:36.117
It was good, thank you.
What's going on here?

33:36.168 --> 33:39.437
They're taking portraits
for publicity.

33:39.471 --> 33:42.573
You certainly look snappy.
I see you have coffee.

33:42.608 --> 33:45.443
I scheduled you later in case you
missed the connection in Los Angeles.

33:45.477 --> 33:48.212
Everything went smoothly.

33:50.098 --> 33:51.449
Welcome back.

33:51.483 --> 33:54.068
I'm jealous
just looking at you.

33:54.119 --> 33:57.155
- I think you'd like it.
- I don't know if it's the photographers

33:57.189 --> 34:00.525
or the writers, but it really
smells like reefer in here.

34:00.559 --> 34:02.126
That has to be enough.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.512
<i>I think we got it.</i>

34:04.546 --> 34:08.266
So, they treat you
like King Kamehameha?

34:09.501 --> 34:11.569
Miss, you mind?

34:19.527 --> 34:20.878
Are these in color?

34:20.913 --> 34:22.847
No, and I'm starting
to regret it.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.748
Do you mind holding onto
the rail, gorgeous?

34:24.783 --> 34:26.667
Think of important things.

34:26.717 --> 34:28.469
Caroline, is the
shoeshine here yet?

34:28.503 --> 34:30.121
No one's going
to see your shoes.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.889
- I want you to call him.
- I did.

34:31.922 --> 34:33.924
So, Don Ho...

34:33.942 --> 34:36.060
did you have a blue drink
in the white sand?

34:36.094 --> 34:39.163
Ernest Borgnine chase you down
an alleyway with a switchblade?

34:39.197 --> 34:40.781
I love that movie.

34:40.831 --> 34:43.034
It was nice.

34:43.068 --> 34:45.636
I think I'm next, but I don't
want to follow that act.

34:47.306 --> 34:50.224
So, you have anything ready
for Sheraton on Friday?

34:50.259 --> 34:52.592
Have I ever walked into
this office after an absence

34:52.643 --> 34:54.545
and not had you bring up
business immediately?

34:54.563 --> 34:56.514
That's only because
I've spent every holiday

34:56.547 --> 34:58.532
waiting on work from you.

34:58.567 --> 35:01.068
And then you walk away from me.

35:01.119 --> 35:03.371
And then you take a nap.

35:03.405 --> 35:06.040
Oh, taking pictures.

35:06.074 --> 35:07.258
Yeah, we'll be done
in a second.

35:10.596 --> 35:13.214
Keep it down out here.

35:18.954 --> 35:21.489
Oh, about your office.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.207
They think it's better
for the pictures.

35:23.242 --> 35:24.625
I don't agree.

35:24.660 --> 35:26.110
They'll move it back.

35:26.144 --> 35:28.746
So when I left, where was I?

35:28.780 --> 35:30.381
I'll get you the files.

36:10.522 --> 36:13.457
As horrible as this is,

36:13.492 --> 36:16.494
I don't think anyone
has made this connection

36:16.528 --> 36:18.029
outside of this comedian.

36:18.063 --> 36:20.798
So it's likely that
any possible controversy--

36:20.832 --> 36:22.433
Well, no one's seen
the TV spot.

36:22.467 --> 36:24.268
They've seen the print
for three weeks,

36:24.303 --> 36:26.437
side by side with
the news story probably.

36:26.471 --> 36:28.005
We haven't heard a peep.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.608
So the controversy
is still in your imagination.

36:30.642 --> 36:34.095
I won't deny that,
but this is a horrible thing.

36:34.129 --> 36:35.746
I believe
that's the word I used.

36:35.764 --> 36:38.466
So?

36:40.319 --> 36:43.354
- I thought I had a solution.
- We can't pull the ad.

36:43.388 --> 36:45.389
Relax, Burt.
And of course we can't.

36:45.407 --> 36:48.659
No, I thought maybe
we could just cut

36:48.694 --> 36:50.528
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears"

36:50.562 --> 36:52.897
and just start with saying

36:52.931 --> 36:55.199
all the great stuff
about the headphones.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.569
That's a great idea.

36:58.603 --> 37:01.972
- You think so?
- I think it's the first idea, but--

37:02.007 --> 37:04.275
It solves everything.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.712
Except it's just a man in a toga now.
It's a non sequitur.

37:07.746 --> 37:10.481
Maybe people will think
it's some kind

37:10.515 --> 37:12.583
of sophisticated joke
that they just didn't get.

37:12.617 --> 37:15.336
I think that while it avoids

37:15.370 --> 37:18.589
any possibility of controversy,
it neuters the joke.

37:18.623 --> 37:20.591
What the hell does that mean?

37:20.625 --> 37:22.560
Look, you don't
know what to do.

37:22.594 --> 37:24.428
I'm telling you what do to.

37:24.462 --> 37:27.498
You are. You have
solved the problem.

37:27.532 --> 37:29.934
But it needs more
than a solution.

37:29.968 --> 37:32.036
It needs to be a great ad.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.708
This is a great place to start.
I just need a little time.

37:37.743 --> 37:39.877
Remember how long it took
us to come up with this one?

37:39.911 --> 37:42.079
I don't know. It just sort
of came to you, didn't it?

37:42.114 --> 37:45.116
No, you rejected
a lot of things.

37:45.150 --> 37:47.451
And we can't shoot one of
the things I rejected?

37:48.920 --> 37:50.521
We just don't have the time.

37:52.090 --> 37:55.659
Look, my job is
to introduce your headphones

37:55.693 --> 37:59.130
to a huge, drunk,
male audience.

37:59.164 --> 38:01.215
And it's not about my work,

38:01.249 --> 38:03.167
it's about making a great ad.

38:03.201 --> 38:05.302
The association
not being with Vietnam,

38:05.337 --> 38:07.838
but with a laugh, a smile,

38:07.872 --> 38:09.840
that all comes
from your headphones.

38:09.875 --> 38:12.576
I don't know how to do that.

38:12.611 --> 38:14.412
But I do.

38:14.446 --> 38:16.347
Give me a couple days.

38:18.016 --> 38:20.985
Okay.

38:31.429 --> 38:34.231
You've got to get
a hold of Ted.

38:43.723 --> 38:45.356
Why do they all
have "love" in them?

38:45.391 --> 38:47.492
- They asked for it.
- It's a big word.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.561
I guess they heard
it on the news.

38:52.709 --> 38:56.956
_

38:58.587 --> 39:01.055
- What the hell is this?
- They're newlyweds.

39:01.090 --> 39:03.391
This couple doesn't exist.

39:03.426 --> 39:06.311
Anything matrimonial
feels Paleolithic.

39:06.345 --> 39:09.481
What are you suggesting? A
little Haight-Ashbury colonial?

39:09.515 --> 39:12.450
A couple of longhairs in love?
That'll get Dow going.

39:12.485 --> 39:14.953
As much as I'd like to join
all the ads making fun

39:14.987 --> 39:16.821
of the ubiquitous
San Francisco hippie,

39:16.839 --> 39:19.257
let's try to trade on the word
"love" as something substantial.

39:19.291 --> 39:22.677
I don't think that's
possible in this context.

39:22.711 --> 39:25.930
So why are we contributing to
the trivialization of the word?

39:25.965 --> 39:28.383
It doesn't belong
in the kitchen.

39:28.434 --> 39:31.236
"I love this."
"I love my oven."

39:31.270 --> 39:34.155
<i>"You know what I'd love? I'd love a
hamburger." We're wearing it out.</i>

39:34.206 --> 39:37.125
Let's leave it
where we want it.

39:37.159 --> 39:40.979
We want that electric
jolt to the body.

39:41.013 --> 39:43.548
We want Eros.
It's like a drug.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.517
It's not domestic.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.602
What's the difference
between a husband

39:47.636 --> 39:50.421
knocking on a door and a
sailor getting off a ship?

39:50.439 --> 39:52.557
About 10,000 volts.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.393
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.496
- Don't let me interrupt.
- No, we were...

39:58.530 --> 40:00.832
just finishing up here.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.550
These are great.

40:02.585 --> 40:04.219
Good to hear.

40:04.253 --> 40:06.387
- This is a pleasant surprise.
- I got out early.

40:06.422 --> 40:08.506
- Is that good or bad?
- What?

40:08.540 --> 40:11.976
Oh, no. Everything's fine.
It was routine.

40:12.011 --> 40:14.178
Well...

40:14.196 --> 40:16.231
welcome to my hospital.

40:19.201 --> 40:20.652
You want a coffee or something?

40:20.686 --> 40:22.370
No.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.706
This is quite a spread.

40:26.125 --> 40:28.009
Well, let's get you set up.

40:28.043 --> 40:30.512
If I looked like you
and talked like that,

40:30.546 --> 40:32.597
I wouldn't have had
to go to medical school.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.816
Please, don't compare
what I do to what you do.

40:34.850 --> 40:38.486
I'm not. Just part of me was
hoping that head was empty.

40:38.521 --> 40:40.638
Can't resist cutting
people open, can you?

40:40.656 --> 40:43.341
All right, enough flirting.
Where's my camera?

40:56.939 --> 40:59.891
I think this is the best one.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.893
I don't know what to say.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.695
Say you're gonna be
the first American

41:03.729 --> 41:05.997
to complete a successful
heart transplant

41:06.031 --> 41:09.400
and that you'll appear in a magazine ad
attributing your success to your Leica.

41:09.435 --> 41:11.970
Well, if that's the only way
you can give it to me.

41:12.004 --> 41:14.923
- I was looking for you.
- Here I am.

41:16.592 --> 41:18.376
Dr. Arnold Rosen.

41:18.394 --> 41:21.279
Sorry, this is Miss Chambers,
my secretary.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.015
I'm sorry, Dr. Rosen. I didn't
know you were coming by.

41:24.033 --> 41:26.217
Oh, no, it's not business.
He's a friend.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.120
They're ready in your office.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.122
- Who?
- They're setting up.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.791
- The photographer.
- I'll do it.

41:33.809 --> 41:36.761
No, you're gonna need a
couple weeks with those instructions.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.130
This'll only take a minute.
Have you had lunch?

41:39.148 --> 41:40.982
No, I have a full afternoon.

41:41.016 --> 41:43.484
But I think our wives are cooking
something up for New Year's.

41:43.519 --> 41:45.803
Told Sylvia to keep
it in the building.

41:45.838 --> 41:47.605
Wasn't my idea.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.774
No, it'll be fun.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.427
As long as I don't have to put
on shoes, it sounds perfect.

41:52.461 --> 41:55.430
And again, thanks for the toy.

42:00.886 --> 42:03.121
See, but I'm free tonight.

42:03.155 --> 42:05.323
So call in sick.

42:05.357 --> 42:08.493
It's easier for them
to replace you than me.

42:10.529 --> 42:12.397
Don't get out of bed yet.

42:12.431 --> 42:14.032
Yes?

42:14.066 --> 42:17.802
I hate to disturb you,
but it's very urgent.

42:17.836 --> 42:19.437
Okay, okay, sit down.

42:21.890 --> 42:25.109
I have to hang up. Looks
like something bad happened.

42:25.144 --> 42:29.013
Well, let me know if your
situation changes. Bye.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.250
Okay. Bye.

42:32.284 --> 42:34.636
Bye. Bye.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.523
What the hell is going on?

42:40.459 --> 42:42.927
I got some tragic news.
You should sit down.

42:42.962 --> 42:45.263
I'll be fine.

42:45.297 --> 42:47.565
Here.

42:50.285 --> 42:52.070
Your Aunt Jessica called.

42:52.104 --> 42:53.538
That's what I hung up for?

42:53.572 --> 42:56.307
Your mother passed away
this morning.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.848
Caroline, honey,

43:03.882 --> 43:06.017
she was 91 years old.

43:06.051 --> 43:08.252
It's hardly a shock.

43:08.287 --> 43:11.739
She was such a sweet woman
and I know how close you were.

43:11.774 --> 43:14.726
For 20 years, she's been saying
this is her last Christmas.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.861
She was always so polite to me

43:16.895 --> 43:19.830
when she could hear me.

43:19.848 --> 43:21.999
So I suppose I'm in charge
of the arrangements.

43:22.017 --> 43:24.002
You want to call
your aunt back?

43:24.036 --> 43:25.370
Nah.
She's a fruitcake.

43:25.404 --> 43:26.871
She'll want to have a séance.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.306
Did she say what happened?

43:28.340 --> 43:30.942
She had a stroke

43:30.976 --> 43:32.677
in the bathroom.

43:32.711 --> 43:35.279
Well, I asked, didn't I?

43:36.982 --> 43:40.151
Talk to Joan.
She'll know what to do.

43:51.947 --> 43:54.098
Okay, okay.

43:54.116 --> 43:56.651
Okay. You're
gonna be okay.

44:11.450 --> 44:13.684
Cheers.

44:20.192 --> 44:22.693
Ah, yes.
This is Peggy Olson

44:22.728 --> 44:25.696
and I'm calling
for Mr. Chaough.

44:25.731 --> 44:27.832
Yes, this is Peggy Olson.

44:29.868 --> 44:33.071
Let's not exaggerate.
I've only called twice.

44:34.406 --> 44:36.207
Look, Father--

44:36.241 --> 44:37.809
oh, I'm sorry, Pastor.

44:37.843 --> 44:40.011
I was raised Catholic.

44:40.045 --> 44:42.914
Well, because my mother is.

44:42.948 --> 44:44.982
My father is Lutheran.

44:45.017 --> 44:48.486
Irish and Norwegian.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.422
No, he passed away.

44:51.457 --> 44:52.824
He was cremated.

44:52.858 --> 44:54.792
Look, Pastor, I'm not saying

44:54.827 --> 44:56.761
that you didn't give
Mr. Chaough the message,

44:56.795 --> 45:00.798
I'm just saying that
it bears some urgency.

45:00.833 --> 45:03.935
Yes, which is to say I don't
think it would bother him at all

45:03.969 --> 45:06.104
to know that I'm on the phone.

45:06.138 --> 45:09.073
Certainly.
Do you have a pen?

45:09.108 --> 45:11.509
This is Peggy Olson

45:11.543 --> 45:15.012
and I'm calling
about the Super Bowl.

45:15.047 --> 45:18.049
I'm in the office,
he has the number.

45:18.083 --> 45:20.718
How could you possibly have
written that down that fast?

45:23.856 --> 45:27.191
I don't know. I think it's gonna be
Oakland or Houston against Green Bay.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.596
And also with you.

45:31.630 --> 45:32.964
Good night.

45:39.638 --> 45:41.772
Phyllis, can I get some coffee?

45:41.806 --> 45:45.309
It's gone cold.

45:45.327 --> 45:46.828
Is this really necessary?

45:46.862 --> 45:48.546
I just got back from Hawaii.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.248
You're backlit,

45:50.282 --> 45:51.949
so even with the tan you look
like you haven't slept.

45:51.967 --> 45:54.285
Don't roll down the sleeves.
Roll them up.

45:54.319 --> 45:55.987
- Really?
- You know what, Chico?

45:56.021 --> 45:58.272
Forget the tripod.
Give me the camera.

46:00.108 --> 46:01.759
Ahem.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.362
What do I do?

46:04.396 --> 46:07.732
I want to see you lost
in that confident thought.

46:07.766 --> 46:10.551
I want to see the brains
behind this operation.

46:10.586 --> 46:12.603
Well, for one thing,
I'd be behind the desk

46:12.638 --> 46:14.338
and my desk
would be over there.

46:15.607 --> 46:17.041
Just do what you do.

46:19.745 --> 46:21.946
Give me a minute.

46:28.904 --> 46:31.822
<i>That's good.</i>

46:32.829 --> 46:36.238
_

46:39.664 --> 46:42.046
_

46:43.969 --> 46:46.337
What's wrong?

46:46.371 --> 46:48.406
<i>Give me a little</i>
<i>"Front Page."</i>

46:48.440 --> 46:51.576
You know, hands on the desk looking
for an answer out that window.

46:51.610 --> 46:53.410
What?

46:55.347 --> 46:56.964
What do you want?

46:57.015 --> 46:59.617
I want you to be yourself.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.743
Sorry to wake you
when you're finally sleeping,

47:18.777 --> 47:20.745
but I waited as long
as I could.

47:22.348 --> 47:23.848
What time is it?

47:23.882 --> 47:26.985
They called me and they
want me to work today.

47:27.019 --> 47:29.620
I told them about the funeral, but
they can't move it to tomorrow

47:29.655 --> 47:31.556
because they'll need me
then, too.

47:31.590 --> 47:35.193
In fact, they need me
for the rest of the week.

47:35.227 --> 47:38.029
That's good, isn't it?

47:38.063 --> 47:41.799
I called Jeff Hunter, but I think
his service won't wake him.

47:41.834 --> 47:44.602
Isn't an agent
supposed to call you?

47:45.938 --> 47:47.939
Good news will keep.

47:51.377 --> 47:53.244
I feel awful about the funeral.

47:53.278 --> 47:54.746
Will you please give Roger
my condolences?

47:54.780 --> 47:56.547
Of course.

47:56.582 --> 47:58.883
You should get some sleep.

47:58.917 --> 48:02.153
How can I?
My wife's a big TV star.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.661
Get some sleep.

48:10.696 --> 48:12.463
Break a leg.

48:40.459 --> 48:43.661
Why are you eating? Sandy's
coming over for lunch.

48:43.679 --> 48:46.831
First of all, I don't know
why you're counting my meals.

48:46.849 --> 48:48.966
And second of all,
Sandy's not coming over.

48:49.001 --> 48:51.569
Oh.
That's a shame.

48:51.603 --> 48:53.654
Is she sick?

48:53.705 --> 48:56.207
Sick of being here.

48:56.241 --> 48:58.309
She went to Juilliard early.

49:00.512 --> 49:02.346
She did?

49:02.381 --> 49:03.881
When?

49:03.915 --> 49:06.217
Did you want her to say
a tearful goodbye to you?

49:06.251 --> 49:09.387
Well, frankly, yes.

49:09.421 --> 49:11.922
Consider yourself lucky.

49:11.940 --> 49:13.591
She was so stuck-up.

49:13.625 --> 49:16.227
She kept saying how
she really was going

49:16.261 --> 49:19.063
to "look back
on this time fondly."

49:19.098 --> 49:21.499
I can't believe she did that.

49:21.533 --> 49:24.469
She acts like she's 25
because she uses tampons.

49:24.503 --> 49:27.171
Sally, please.

49:27.206 --> 49:29.307
Did she give you her address?

49:29.341 --> 49:32.009
Can you drive Jackie
and me to the movies?

49:34.913 --> 49:37.682
This is a great vacation.

50:04.643 --> 50:07.178
You know, she was like
a sister to me.

50:07.212 --> 50:08.946
A much older sister.

50:08.981 --> 50:12.216
How she could have a boy
your age, I don't know.

50:12.251 --> 50:14.385
You could be her grandson.

50:14.419 --> 50:16.821
You need to
get your eyes checked.

50:16.855 --> 50:19.824
- These are stunning rooms.
- Thank you.

50:19.858 --> 50:22.660
He is so handsome.

50:22.694 --> 50:26.530
I swear you have
not aged a day.

50:27.866 --> 50:30.668
Oh, Jane, darling.

50:30.702 --> 50:33.271
- Thank you for coming.
- I thought I should.

50:33.305 --> 50:36.190
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I would like to speak first.

50:36.225 --> 50:38.109
I think you just did.

50:38.143 --> 50:40.478
No, the eulogies.
The remarks.

50:40.512 --> 50:43.347
- I wish to go first.
- Of course. Of course.

50:43.382 --> 50:46.551
If you need to speak
to me, I understand.

50:50.289 --> 50:52.306
Thank you for rescuing me.

50:52.341 --> 50:55.393
- From your admirers?
- You look wonderful.

50:55.427 --> 50:59.230
I don't know if you remember,
but I have her ring.

50:59.264 --> 51:00.431
I don't know
if you want it back.

51:00.465 --> 51:02.033
What am I gonna do with it?

51:02.067 --> 51:04.035
For Margaret or...

51:04.069 --> 51:05.803
I don't know,
to bury her in it.

51:05.837 --> 51:08.773
We already burned her up.
They steal that stuff anyway.

51:08.807 --> 51:10.174
Just keep it.
She liked you.

51:10.209 --> 51:12.610
You always paid
your rent on time.

51:12.644 --> 51:15.346
Do you want the victuals
in the parlor?

51:15.380 --> 51:17.548
What?

51:17.583 --> 51:19.883
Hold on, I didn't order
any of this.

51:19.902 --> 51:22.553
It's supposed to be
tea and petits fours.

51:22.571 --> 51:24.572
Oh, hell, put it
in the dining room.

51:26.775 --> 51:29.794
- I'm really sorry for your loss.
- She was a great lady.

51:29.828 --> 51:32.163
"Bob Benson, SCDP."
Who the hell is that?

51:32.197 --> 51:34.332
That's from us.

51:34.366 --> 51:36.801
Daddy, I think it's time.

51:36.835 --> 51:39.070
What's the rush?

51:40.639 --> 51:41.906
Thank you for coming.

51:43.976 --> 51:46.844
God, she is all kinds
of trouble, isn't she?

51:46.878 --> 51:48.746
Everything turns
you on, doesn't it?

51:49.881 --> 51:52.016
Is your mother still alive?

51:58.957 --> 52:01.976
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time.

52:02.010 --> 52:04.262
How many funerals
have you been to today?

52:04.296 --> 52:06.998
- Excuse me?
- He wants to know where you got the drink.

52:08.133 --> 52:10.034
Give my regards to Megan.

52:10.068 --> 52:12.436
Rumor has it they're gonna
move her to four days a week.

52:12.471 --> 52:14.538
Legend has it.

52:14.573 --> 52:18.075
So, is she alive?

52:18.093 --> 52:20.744
Yes, she is.

52:20.762 --> 52:23.214
Don, what about your mother?

52:23.248 --> 52:24.715
Still with us?

52:24.750 --> 52:27.568
I'm gonna watch
from over there.

52:29.187 --> 52:30.854
If I could get your attention.

52:30.872 --> 52:33.190
<i>I'd like to thank</i>
<i>everyone for coming.</i>

52:33.225 --> 52:36.127
I apologize
for the dry atmosphere,

52:36.161 --> 52:38.796
but as I've been reminded
many times today,

52:38.830 --> 52:40.931
<i>Mother did not approve</i>
<i>of libations.</i>

52:40.966 --> 52:43.934
Excuse me, but I have
a few words to say.

52:43.969 --> 52:45.436
I insist.

52:45.470 --> 52:49.073
Of course. Why don't
you roll on over here?

52:58.383 --> 53:01.052
Can everyone forget
what I've said so far

53:01.086 --> 53:04.288
so that Mrs. Hazel Tinsley,
who graciously flew up

53:04.306 --> 53:06.223
from Palm Beach, can have
the honor of going first?

53:06.258 --> 53:07.625
Stay here.

53:07.659 --> 53:10.895
<i>I want to say</i>
<i>something, if I may,</i>

53:10.929 --> 53:13.114
at this informal moment

53:13.148 --> 53:15.700
because I do not believe
in speaking graveside.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.703
This is where she lived
and this is where she died.

53:20.238 --> 53:23.841
"This woman spent 90 years
on the Earth,

53:23.875 --> 53:26.977
of noble birth
and of some advantage,

53:27.012 --> 53:30.715
devoting herself to one man,
but loving another.

53:30.749 --> 53:34.352
That man was Roger."
That's you.

53:34.386 --> 53:38.022
"When Roger Sterling Sr.'s
brief time was over,

53:38.056 --> 53:41.492
it was this Roger
who filled her days.

53:41.526 --> 53:45.996
One could not talk to her without
hearing about his achievements,

53:46.031 --> 53:48.632
<i>his wit, his kindness.</i>

53:48.667 --> 53:50.201
We all said, 'Mimsy.

53:50.235 --> 53:53.637
Mims, you should find another man.
Life is long.'

53:53.672 --> 53:56.173
<i>She said, 'I don't need anyone.</i>

53:56.208 --> 54:01.078
My heart is full because
my son is my sunshine.'"

54:05.751 --> 54:06.834
Get him out of here.

54:09.654 --> 54:12.389
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.610
Where were you?

54:16.661 --> 54:18.245
I'm sorry, but is
that man all right?

54:18.280 --> 54:20.531
- What's he doing here?
- What?

54:20.565 --> 54:22.566
- You heard me.
- Can we get someone in here to clean up?

54:22.584 --> 54:24.919
- Let Bruce Pike clean it up.
- Roger.

54:24.953 --> 54:26.670
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

54:26.705 --> 54:28.172
I think it would have
been more respectful

54:28.206 --> 54:29.807
of you not to come.
She didn't like you either.

54:29.841 --> 54:31.976
I don't think
I ever met your mother.

54:32.010 --> 54:34.378
She wouldn't if she had. This
is supposed to be just family.

54:34.396 --> 54:37.381
- See how upset everybody is?
- Roger, stop. Stop it this minute.

54:37.416 --> 54:39.617
- You shouldn't have brought him.
- Daddy, please.

54:39.651 --> 54:41.652
This is my funeral!

54:41.686 --> 54:44.221
You know what?
Party's over.

54:44.256 --> 54:46.924
Everybody out.

54:46.958 --> 54:49.693
Thank you very much.
Out!

55:03.792 --> 55:06.293
Thank you.

55:08.330 --> 55:10.631
Pardon me.
I'm looking for someone.

55:10.665 --> 55:12.716
Could you help me?

55:21.426 --> 55:23.227
Everybody's gone.

55:23.261 --> 55:25.329
Not everybody, obviously.

55:25.363 --> 55:27.998
I think they were overwhelmed
by that touching tribute.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.834
What do you want?

55:29.868 --> 55:32.203
That man never tires
of embarrassing himself.

55:32.237 --> 55:33.838
You're the one who brought him.

55:33.872 --> 55:36.707
I'm talking about Don.

55:36.741 --> 55:39.276
Oh. He was just saying what
everybody else was thinking.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.780
You shouldn't have brought him.

55:42.814 --> 55:44.515
You're right.

55:44.549 --> 55:48.085
Now you have one on me.
Do you feel better?

55:48.119 --> 55:50.321
My mother's dead.

55:50.355 --> 55:52.323
I know, Roger.

55:53.558 --> 55:55.593
Must be very hard for you.

55:55.627 --> 55:57.695
I don't feel anything.

55:59.030 --> 56:01.565
You certainly seem emotional.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.133
Because I need a drink.

56:03.168 --> 56:05.769
She lived a long time.

56:05.804 --> 56:08.239
And she knew
that you loved her.

56:08.273 --> 56:11.075
So maybe there's nothing
to drink about.

56:13.144 --> 56:15.412
I feel like she always wanted to
spend time with me and I never did.

56:15.447 --> 56:17.915
That may be something
to consider.

56:17.949 --> 56:20.217
You have a family.

56:20.252 --> 56:22.887
Are you kidding me?
I looked out at that crowd

56:22.921 --> 56:24.889
and all I saw was a bunch
more women I've disappointed.

56:24.923 --> 56:27.691
Roger Sterling,
no matter what you do,

56:27.726 --> 56:29.927
everyone loves you.

56:29.961 --> 56:33.330
What you're seeing is them worried
about how you feel about them.

56:33.365 --> 56:36.066
So, you miss me?

56:36.101 --> 56:38.269
I know your daughter does.

56:40.038 --> 56:42.239
Don't you wonder what Margaret
will say at your funeral?

56:42.274 --> 56:43.874
You had to bring that up.

56:43.909 --> 56:45.342
I did.

56:45.377 --> 56:47.344
You should spend
more time with her.

56:47.379 --> 56:49.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:49.214 --> 56:52.149
Remember the last time
this bed was covered in furs?

56:52.183 --> 56:54.485
We rolled around all over them.

56:54.519 --> 56:56.520
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

56:56.555 --> 56:58.355
You look great.

56:58.390 --> 57:00.457
It would be soothing.

57:00.492 --> 57:02.459
Soothe yourself.

57:02.494 --> 57:04.361
I'm gonna clean up.

57:18.677 --> 57:20.210
Jonesy.

57:20.228 --> 57:21.729
Mr. Draper,
are you all right?

57:21.763 --> 57:24.014
- He's not feeling well.
- Hey, Jonesy.

57:24.048 --> 57:26.400
Jonesy, what did you see?

57:26.434 --> 57:28.552
I didn't see
nothing, Mr. Draper.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.604
No, no, when you died,
what did you see?

57:30.655 --> 57:33.023
- Don, let's get you upstairs.
- Wait, I want to know.

57:33.057 --> 57:35.525
I want to know.

57:35.543 --> 57:37.244
What did you see when you died?

57:37.295 --> 57:39.747
I don't know. Doc said
I wasn't really dead.

57:39.798 --> 57:42.333
I saw it. You were dead.
He died right there.

57:42.367 --> 57:43.801
What did you see?

57:43.835 --> 57:45.636
I don't like to think about it.

57:45.670 --> 57:48.639
- You must have seen something.
- I guess there was a light.

57:48.673 --> 57:50.841
Was it like hot,
tropical sunshine?

57:50.859 --> 57:53.343
- I don't know.
- Did you hear the ocean?

57:53.361 --> 57:54.645
Mr. Draper,
you should go upstairs.

57:57.332 --> 57:59.617
- Is he all right?
- He'll be fine.

58:02.454 --> 58:04.488
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

58:04.522 --> 58:06.457
- Is that St. Mark's Place?
- Yup.

58:06.491 --> 58:08.592
I'm sorry, I'm looking
for someone.

58:08.626 --> 58:10.311
A girl.

58:10.345 --> 58:12.262
- Which one?
- This one.

58:12.296 --> 58:14.898
There's lots of chicks that
come in and out of here.

58:14.933 --> 58:17.534
I've been in the buildings across the street.
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

58:17.569 --> 58:20.454
Look, lady, it's cold as a witch's tit.
We're going inside.

58:20.488 --> 58:22.206
May I?

58:22.240 --> 58:24.208
Door's always open, man.

58:51.252 --> 58:52.803
<i>Hey, I got the pork butt</i>

58:52.837 --> 58:54.805
<i>and I lifted a bunch of onions.</i>

59:35.046 --> 59:37.314
Sandy?

59:41.236 --> 59:43.020
Sandy?

59:45.690 --> 59:48.876
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

59:54.666 --> 59:56.834
I'm sorry to bother you again,

59:56.868 --> 59:59.870
but this violin,
this belongs to the girl

59:59.904 --> 01:00:02.039
I was talking about. Are you
sure you haven't seen her?

01:00:02.073 --> 01:00:04.675
Look, lady, I don't want to have
to lay the regular rap on you,

01:00:04.709 --> 01:00:06.660
but I am exhausted
from telling people like you

01:00:06.694 --> 01:00:09.146
- I haven't seen people like her.
- But she was here.

01:00:09.164 --> 01:00:11.081
I haven't seen your daughter.

01:00:11.116 --> 01:00:12.950
She's not my daughter.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.385
So, what are you,
some kind of social worker?

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.121
Her violin teacher?

01:00:19.808 --> 01:00:22.592
Shit.
What's her name?

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.694
Sandy.

01:00:23.728 --> 01:00:26.563
Hey, anybody seen Sandy?

01:00:26.597 --> 01:00:28.699
Do you know how
to make goulash?

01:00:28.733 --> 01:00:30.801
'Cause I've got pork butt,
two onions, and lentils

01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:32.569
which I think is what's in it.

01:00:32.604 --> 01:00:34.271
Hey, Moon, turn around.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.409
And paprika.
I know that's in it.

01:00:40.912 --> 01:00:42.679
Well, for one thing,
you'll need a pot.

01:00:42.714 --> 01:00:44.715
We got a pot.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:47.885
You'll have to wash it out.

01:00:47.919 --> 01:00:49.553
There's no water.

01:00:49.571 --> 01:00:51.455
Really?

01:00:51.489 --> 01:00:53.490
We used to use the hose
at the Episcopal church,

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:55.542
but now the pipes are frozen.

01:00:55.577 --> 01:00:57.795
It was great here all summer.
It was hot.

01:00:57.829 --> 01:01:00.731
So much rather be hot
than cold.

01:01:00.765 --> 01:01:02.566
I'll go on the roof
and get a chunk of snow.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.936
- Oh, you'll get sick.
- We do it all the time.

01:01:07.772 --> 01:01:10.407
My mom makes great goulash.

01:01:10.441 --> 01:01:13.377
- Where are you from?
- Everywhere.

01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:15.112
Hold on.

01:01:15.146 --> 01:01:16.864
I think there's
an army knife by the bed.

01:01:23.273 --> 01:01:25.140
Hello?

01:01:28.512 --> 01:01:29.812
Your mother still here?

01:01:29.846 --> 01:01:31.647
No. She left.

01:01:31.681 --> 01:01:33.816
I'm just waiting for them
to wrap up the deli.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.551
Where's Skeezix?

01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:37.570
Brooks took him bike riding.

01:01:37.604 --> 01:01:39.071
It's kind of cold out there.

01:01:39.105 --> 01:01:40.890
He can't tell the difference.

01:01:40.924 --> 01:01:43.125
The other day
he walked in singing

01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:45.694
and I looked
and his nose was bleeding.

01:01:45.729 --> 01:01:48.063
He didn't know how he did it.

01:01:48.098 --> 01:01:49.698
So he's tough.

01:01:52.302 --> 01:01:54.770
Listen, I want you
to have something.

01:02:06.199 --> 01:02:08.817
This was your grandmother's.

01:02:10.203 --> 01:02:12.504
My dad brought it back for her.

01:02:12.539 --> 01:02:15.641
He went everywhere.

01:02:15.675 --> 01:02:18.327
- What is it?
- It's water from the River Jordan.

01:02:18.361 --> 01:02:20.629
I was baptized with it.
So were you.

01:02:20.664 --> 01:02:23.799
We would have used it on Ellery,
but I guess she forgot.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:25.634
Hope she didn't
put her teeth in it.

01:02:25.669 --> 01:02:29.088
Well, thank you.
It's lovely.

01:02:31.591 --> 01:02:35.744
Did Nana Mimsy
leave me anything else?

01:02:35.779 --> 01:02:38.047
I'm afraid she left
everything to the zoo.

01:02:38.081 --> 01:02:41.116
She's making them
name the animals.

01:02:41.151 --> 01:02:43.085
I'm sorry.

01:02:43.103 --> 01:02:45.220
That doesn't seem funny to me.

01:02:45.255 --> 01:02:46.922
It does to me.

01:02:46.957 --> 01:02:48.857
Her will looked like
the manifest from Noah's ark.

01:02:48.892 --> 01:02:51.393
Well, it's different for you.

01:02:51.428 --> 01:02:53.596
Brooks didn't start
off where you did.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:56.215
- He'll get there.
- Oh, I know he will.

01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:58.834
It's just
that there's--

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.377
well, Daddy, there's
this opportunity.

01:03:08.411 --> 01:03:10.879
I don't know, I--

01:03:10.914 --> 01:03:12.348
I told Nana about it,

01:03:12.382 --> 01:03:14.783
but obviously
she didn't understand.

01:03:14.818 --> 01:03:17.653
Were you this specific?

01:03:17.687 --> 01:03:19.755
Daddy, don't.

01:03:19.773 --> 01:03:22.591
It's not good for you.

01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:25.260
I worry.

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:30.099
Refrigeration.

01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:32.534
It's the wave
of the future, Daddy.

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:35.070
<i>They can transport fruit</i>
<i>all the way from California</i>

01:03:35.105 --> 01:03:37.206
in just four days
and it doesn't go bad.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.942
Some of these trucks
can carry 20 tons.

01:03:39.976 --> 01:03:42.177
And, of course, you're
buying the technology

01:03:42.212 --> 01:03:45.047
for the refrigerated trucks, so it
doesn't matter what they get used for.

01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:47.916
It's really not
Brooks' problem.

01:03:47.951 --> 01:03:51.854
Well, I guess you should have
Brooks talk to me about it.

01:03:51.888 --> 01:03:53.522
Of course.

01:03:53.556 --> 01:03:55.824
I know he'd like to
make it on his own, but--

01:03:55.859 --> 01:03:57.459
I'd have to see
something on paper.

01:03:57.494 --> 01:03:58.994
Oh, he's got that, believe me.

01:03:59.029 --> 01:04:03.365
Well, good.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.134
And I'm glad
we had this little chat.

01:04:05.168 --> 01:04:07.135
Oh, Daddy.

01:04:12.608 --> 01:04:15.644
I'm going to go see if
they're done in the kitchen.

01:04:25.055 --> 01:04:27.222
<i>Don?</i>

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.359
Don?

01:04:30.393 --> 01:04:33.996
Did you make it
to the memorial?

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:37.082
Except for the mess, you're
exactly where I left you.

01:04:37.117 --> 01:04:40.169
I put in an appearance.
I just should have had lunch.

01:04:40.203 --> 01:04:41.703
Aspirin?

01:04:41.721 --> 01:04:44.723
I'm better now.
You?

01:04:44.758 --> 01:04:47.810
Well, I pushed Derek's
mother down the stairs.

01:04:47.844 --> 01:04:50.179
- Did you?
- I did.

01:04:50.213 --> 01:04:53.182
They wanted me to radiate evil,
so I looked her in the eyes,

01:04:53.216 --> 01:04:54.783
but I don't know
how close the camera was

01:04:54.818 --> 01:04:56.819
because it was
a stuntman in a dress.

01:04:56.853 --> 01:04:58.987
Don't worry. I don't think there's
a nice way you can do that.

01:04:59.022 --> 01:05:02.124
I'm not sure people will want
my autograph anymore.

01:05:02.158 --> 01:05:03.459
Yes, they will.

01:05:03.493 --> 01:05:05.327
So you'll still love me

01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:07.763
even if I'm a lying,
cheating whore?

01:05:07.797 --> 01:05:10.566
But I'm gonna walk
behind you on the stairs.

01:05:12.786 --> 01:05:15.771
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
make you dinner.

01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:19.441
Oh, Rosa found this
in the garbage.

01:05:19.459 --> 01:05:22.911
I think she was afraid
you'd think she was stealing.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.998
<i>Sleep.</i>
<i>I'll come get you.</i>

01:05:38.595 --> 01:05:40.562
<i>Hey, Danny, where'd
you take that joint?</i>

01:05:40.597 --> 01:05:43.632
There's three fucking rooms.
Where do you think I am?

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:48.103
No, thank you.

01:05:49.839 --> 01:05:51.540
Is marijuana expensive?

01:05:51.574 --> 01:05:52.941
Do I have to stir it again?

01:05:52.976 --> 01:05:55.377
- Is it boiling?
- No.

01:05:55.411 --> 01:05:58.497
- My coat smells like onions.
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

01:05:58.531 --> 01:06:01.283
You better tell him you did the cooking, man.
It's your job.

01:06:01.317 --> 01:06:02.785
It's my bag.

01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:08.423
- It smells good.
- I made goulash.

01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:11.126
- Did you get Wonder Bread?
- We got batteries.

01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:13.262
Hey, Zal, did you make
any friends today?

01:06:13.296 --> 01:06:15.497
Did you run into this chick?
What's her name?

01:06:17.367 --> 01:06:20.468
I'm sorry.
This violin belongs

01:06:20.487 --> 01:06:22.371
to my friend Sandy. Do you
know when she'll be back?

01:06:22.405 --> 01:06:24.540
Sorry, Blondie, but that
violin belongs to me.

01:06:24.574 --> 01:06:28.076
No, I know the girl who plays this
violin and I'm looking for her.

01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:34.416
Yeah, no, I saw her.
She sold it to me.

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.685
She's trying to get enough
bread to go to California.

01:06:36.719 --> 01:06:38.020
Says it's too cold.

01:06:39.656 --> 01:06:41.156
So where is she now?

01:06:41.191 --> 01:06:44.109
- Does she owe you money?
- No.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.095
Well, your daughter's long gone,
Blondie, so why don't you run along?

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.898
- Come on, Zal.
- Why are you being so rude?

01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:53.068
Why can't you leave her be?
Kills you to be out of control.

01:06:53.102 --> 01:06:55.304
Well, someone needs
to control this mess.

01:06:55.338 --> 01:06:57.539
Lady, we have to take everything
the Establishment throws away.

01:06:57.574 --> 01:06:59.174
That's all that's left.

01:06:59.209 --> 01:07:01.176
What you can't grok
is that we are your garbage.

01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:03.378
You don't want this house,
you don't want us.

01:07:03.413 --> 01:07:05.547
You're not allowed
to ask anybody to leave.

01:07:05.582 --> 01:07:07.149
The bylaws say
if someone is a nuisance

01:07:07.183 --> 01:07:09.084
or a narc,
that shall not be observed.

01:07:09.118 --> 01:07:11.987
I'm obviously not
the people you're talking about.

01:07:12.021 --> 01:07:14.690
I came here because I'm looking
for someone that I do want.

01:07:14.724 --> 01:07:16.358
I did not throw her away.

01:07:16.392 --> 01:07:18.310
Yeah, you're a goodie.
I can tell.

01:07:22.899 --> 01:07:24.867
Look at this.
She's got 80 bucks.

01:07:24.901 --> 01:07:28.537
- Can I have it?
- No. That's all they care about.

01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:32.174
Well, Miss Elizabeth
Hofstadt Francis

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:33.775
of Rye, New York,

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:37.012
eyes blue, hair bottled,

01:07:37.046 --> 01:07:39.882
we don't like your life
any more than you do.

01:07:41.484 --> 01:07:43.652
You have bad manners.

01:07:43.686 --> 01:07:46.388
You deserve to live in
the street of this pigsty,

01:07:46.406 --> 01:07:49.958
and I hope you get tetanus or crabs or
whatever else is crawling around here.

01:07:49.993 --> 01:07:51.743
Hey, that's my violin.

01:07:53.079 --> 01:07:55.197
She sold it?
I don't believe you.

01:07:55.231 --> 01:07:57.065
You want it? I'll give
it to you for 10.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.901
What are you going
to do with a violin?

01:07:58.935 --> 01:08:00.369
Gonna learn how to play it.

01:08:00.403 --> 01:08:02.220
Because it's so easy.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.995
There's a meatball, which
is probably cold by now,

01:08:36.046 --> 01:08:39.666
and an Italian, which is
probably even colder.

01:08:42.286 --> 01:08:44.636
You're typing a lot.
You got a new way to go?

01:08:44.671 --> 01:08:46.840
No, I'm doing this thing
Don used to do.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.559
I'm writing a letter
to a fictitious acquaintance

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:51.928
telling her how great
my new headphones are.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.930
Well, I hate that
it gives you extra work,

01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:56.316
but I think it's about time

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:59.102
this unjust war is finally
having an impact on commerce.

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:00.970
Meatball.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:04.157
- Did we order dinner?
- No.

01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:06.326
I can share.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:09.578
Try the headphones again.
Try and think of some words.

01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:14.283
- What have you got?
- We have three very different angles.

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:16.452
<i>If you dip the audio</i>
<i>in the wide shot,</i>

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.004
Mark Antony is just, you know,

01:09:18.037 --> 01:09:20.290
mouthing the "lend me
your ears" part.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.457
You hear the announcer say
one of these things--

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:26.011
One. "Are you ready for
the sound for the ages?"

01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:30.300
Two. "Koss knows that
good sound is timeless."

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:32.501
Or "Ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.837
this is not your
old-fashioned sound."

01:09:35.856 --> 01:09:37.974
What's the next one?

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:41.144
- The next one or the second one?
- You said you had three.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:43.229
Those were three.
Didn't I read all of them?

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.680
Those are three different
versions of the same idea.

01:09:45.698 --> 01:09:48.350
If you can't tell the difference
between which part's the idea

01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:51.037
and which part's the execution of
the idea, you're of no use to me.

01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:52.822
I know what you're doing.
I've been you.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.541
You're hoping this
sparks my imagination

01:09:54.575 --> 01:09:55.992
and then you can say,
"Wow, she's a genius,"

01:09:56.026 --> 01:09:58.244
or say anything because
you want to go home.

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.330
I think they're very
different from each other.

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:01.864
Well, I'm sorry
to point it out,

01:10:01.882 --> 01:10:03.750
but you're walking
over the same ground.

01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:06.369
When you bring me something like
this, it looks like cowardice.

01:10:06.387 --> 01:10:09.205
Here, you can split this
'cause you're not going home.

01:10:14.762 --> 01:10:16.062
What do you think?

01:10:16.096 --> 01:10:17.647
What?

01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:24.020
- How do they sound?
- Scared. You were a little rough.

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.272
No, the headphones.
Don't worry about them.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:28.691
Some workers
don't respond to that.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:31.394
Look, Abe, I don't need
another negative voice.

01:10:31.412 --> 01:10:33.746
And those, quote, "workers" aren't
surprised that I'm frustrated

01:10:33.781 --> 01:10:35.281
because they know
that they're lazy.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.617
Sorry. I didn't know
what kind of abuse

01:10:37.668 --> 01:10:39.202
was required
to get into the frat.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.838
Listen to your music, kid.

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:14.570
Because you laughed at him.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.772
Yes, they like that.

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:18.491
Hello.

01:11:28.469 --> 01:11:30.887
Where you been?

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.008
I had some errands to run.

01:11:36.844 --> 01:11:39.312
Well, I know what somebody's
getting next Christmas.

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:45.351
Did you eat?

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:47.320
Chicken salad.

01:11:47.354 --> 01:11:50.907
That's a relief,
because my feet are frozen.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:01.150
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:03.002
Morning.
How are we today?

01:12:03.037 --> 01:12:05.288
- Fine, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:07.507
Seeing as how you
were under the weather,

01:12:07.541 --> 01:12:10.626
I just wanted to remind you about
Jules and Terry from Sheraton later.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.178
Cancel.

01:12:12.212 --> 01:12:13.880
Their bosses are coming
back next week

01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:16.382
and they just sent you
on a very expensive trip.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.637
Would you get Stan in here?

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.222
Oh, listen.

01:12:23.273 --> 01:12:25.975
I got this by mistake.
It belongs to some private.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:28.361
See if you can find out some
way to get it to his division.

01:12:28.395 --> 01:12:30.530
I will. Do you want
to enclose a note?

01:12:30.564 --> 01:12:34.233
Nah. I found it
on a barstool.

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:36.352
I mean, you've got to be
on my side here, right?

01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:40.323
First my ex-wife works the body
with a brutal guilt attack

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:43.192
and then my daughter works
the wallet like a speed bag.

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.877
<i>You want me on your side?</i>

01:12:44.912 --> 01:12:48.164
- You have kids?
- We're not talking about me.

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:50.199
You know, I used
to jump off mountains.

01:12:50.217 --> 01:12:53.702
It never occurred to me
I had this invisible parachute.

01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:56.756
My mother loved me in some
completely pointless way

01:12:56.807 --> 01:12:59.425
and it's gone.
So there it is.

01:12:59.476 --> 01:13:02.895
She gave me my last
new experience.

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:05.681
And now I know that
all I'm going to be doing

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:08.551
from here on
is losing everything.

01:13:08.569 --> 01:13:11.104
You feel loss.

01:13:11.155 --> 01:13:12.855
Damn it, how many times
do I have to say this?

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.524
I don't feel anything.

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:16.109
I'm just acknowledging
that life,

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.911
unlike this analysis,
will eventually end

01:13:18.946 --> 01:13:21.564
and somebody else
will get the bill.

01:13:28.088 --> 01:13:30.339
- Good morning, Ken.
- Good morning, Bob.

01:13:34.795 --> 01:13:36.712
What are you doing out here?

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.414
You have a meeting
with someone important?

01:13:38.449 --> 01:13:40.550
No, but are you looking for me?

01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:43.752
I'll drop everything. I just came
out here to enjoy the light.

01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:45.288
Oh, I thought maybe
you were out here

01:13:45.322 --> 01:13:47.090
greeting customers
for your catering business.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.979
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly.

01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:57.116
I'm sorry,
are you cross with me?

01:13:57.151 --> 01:13:59.118
Someone sent a royal spread
to Sterling's.

01:13:59.153 --> 01:14:00.820
It had a card on it
with your name.

01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:03.790
Oh, that. It just
seemed the thing to do.

01:14:03.824 --> 01:14:05.774
Well, it was too much.

01:14:05.793 --> 01:14:08.578
It was almost like you were
invited, but you weren't.

01:14:08.612 --> 01:14:12.165
I guess I was just remembering
when my father died.

01:14:12.216 --> 01:14:14.617
Any gesture
meant something to me.

01:14:14.635 --> 01:14:16.669
There wasn't supposed
to be a card.

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:20.456
Okay.

01:14:20.474 --> 01:14:22.842
Well, take your work
and go back to your office.

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:25.144
Sitting out here makes people
think you have nothing to do,

01:14:25.179 --> 01:14:27.630
and I suspect you're
hoping it's the opposite.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.475
I guess it's time to catch up
on my phone calls.

01:14:43.363 --> 01:14:46.532
Look, we're sorry we had to squeeze
in this meeting between the holidays.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:49.152
We're obviously not expecting
a full presentation.

01:14:49.186 --> 01:14:51.487
Well, I can say
with all honesty that Don

01:14:51.522 --> 01:14:54.323
has not stopped talking about
your incredible property.

01:14:54.358 --> 01:14:57.560
I never stayed at the Royal, but
I shipped out of Pearl in 1943

01:14:57.594 --> 01:15:00.530
and, I've got to say, I can
still smell the gardenias.

01:15:00.564 --> 01:15:03.566
Thank you for that.
Don?

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.386
So, Bob Grange and his
delightful wife Patty

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:09.838
saw to our every need
and also missed no opportunity

01:15:09.857 --> 01:15:12.191
to expose us
to the unique local flavor.

01:15:12.226 --> 01:15:14.477
Lucky Bob.
I tried to get that job,

01:15:14.511 --> 01:15:17.029
but unfortunately
I got promoted.

01:15:18.365 --> 01:15:20.199
Well, I've just come back

01:15:20.234 --> 01:15:22.851
and I'm not sure how much
I've talked about it,

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:26.072
but there is a feeling
that's stayed with me.

01:15:26.123 --> 01:15:28.023
I've been in the winter.

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.076
It's quite a shock coming back.

01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:33.329
Well put. But that
could be any vacation.

01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:35.864
This was very, very different.

01:15:37.551 --> 01:15:40.503
I think we're not selling
a geographical location.

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:42.505
We're selling an experience.

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:44.840
It's not just
a different place,

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.176
you are different.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.729
And you'd think there'd be
an unsettling feeling

01:15:49.763 --> 01:15:52.265
about something so drastically
different, but there's something else.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:58.721
You don't miss anything.
You're not homesick.

01:15:58.739 --> 01:16:01.857
It puts you in this state.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.943
The air and the water

01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:06.078
are all the same
temperature as your body.

01:16:06.113 --> 01:16:08.915
It's sensory--
the music, the fragrance,

01:16:08.949 --> 01:16:11.667
the breeze, and the blue.
Stan.

01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:14.921
Ahem.

01:16:14.955 --> 01:16:16.956
It's just a sketch.

01:16:17.007 --> 01:16:19.575
<i>Hawaiian legend
has it that the soul</i>

01:16:19.593 --> 01:16:21.744
can go in and out of the body,

01:16:21.762 --> 01:16:26.248
but that it usually leaves from
a leeward point into the waves.

01:16:26.266 --> 01:16:29.769
"Hawaii.
The jumping off point."

01:16:36.026 --> 01:16:38.261
So what happened to him?

01:16:38.295 --> 01:16:40.613
He got off the plane,
took a deep breath,

01:16:40.647 --> 01:16:44.600
shed his skin, and jumped off.

01:16:44.618 --> 01:16:46.819
I assume this is a photograph.

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:49.455
More color.
That water is transparent.

01:16:49.489 --> 01:16:52.608
Well, I suppose it reminds
me a little of the cinema.

01:16:54.127 --> 01:16:56.462
But mostly I see James Mason

01:16:56.496 --> 01:16:59.799
- at the end of that movie walking
into the sea. - What is that movie?

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:01.617
I'm not sure I know
what you're taking about.

01:17:01.635 --> 01:17:04.303
He's killing himself.
I don't think they show it,

01:17:04.338 --> 01:17:06.973
but he's going to swim out
until he can't swim back.

01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:12.595
That may be a personal
association for you,

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:14.296
but that's not what this means.

01:17:14.314 --> 01:17:17.132
We looked at this. None
of us thought of that.

01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:19.635
"A Star is Born."

01:17:19.653 --> 01:17:23.105
The copy is all about
the Hawaiian legend.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:25.775
Aloha means hello and goodbye.

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:28.327
I'm sorry, but this
is very poetic.

01:17:28.362 --> 01:17:30.780
- Thank you.
- Where's our hotel?

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:34.367
Where's the Pink Palace
and Diamond Head?

01:17:34.418 --> 01:17:36.202
You got to have
Diamond Head in the shot.

01:17:36.253 --> 01:17:37.837
Anyone can do that.

01:17:39.506 --> 01:17:41.040
I don't agree.

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:47.847
Well, there's no reason we can't
tilt the camera up 45 degrees

01:17:47.881 --> 01:17:50.800
and see the husk of our
city dweller on the sand

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:54.387
and an arm of the hotel and
Diamond Head in the background.

01:17:54.438 --> 01:17:56.639
So there would be a man
in this photo

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.224
and he most likely
would be naked?

01:17:58.275 --> 01:18:01.176
Actually, my first thought
is there is no man.

01:18:01.194 --> 01:18:04.397
Just his footprints.
What happened to him?

01:18:04.448 --> 01:18:07.700
I think, and I think
people might think,

01:18:07.734 --> 01:18:09.852
that he died.

01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:11.687
Maybe he did
and he went to heaven.

01:18:11.705 --> 01:18:14.523
Maybe that's what
this feels like.

01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.660
- It's a little morbid.
- Well, heaven's a little morbid.

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:20.195
How do you get to heaven?
Something terrible has to happen.

01:18:21.548 --> 01:18:23.833
We don't want that in the ad.

01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:27.253
Of course there's
no doubt this concept itself

01:18:27.304 --> 01:18:30.038
is merely a jumping
off the point.

01:18:30.057 --> 01:18:32.925
A picture of a hotel,
even yours,

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:34.710
is easy to ignore.

01:18:34.728 --> 01:18:38.097
This, or some version of this,
demands your attention.

01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:40.566
Well, you will continue
to have our attention.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.102
Make no mistake, we're not
afraid of provocative.

01:18:46.406 --> 01:18:49.608
So is there any time left for
holiday plans for either of you?

01:18:49.659 --> 01:18:51.777
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- You as well.

01:18:54.331 --> 01:18:55.865
What's the matter? You didn't
get all your vomiting done

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.083
at my mother's funeral?

01:18:57.117 --> 01:18:58.951
Roger, I apologize.
I had a bug.

01:18:59.002 --> 01:19:01.087
Yeah, well, you didn't
miss anything.

01:19:01.121 --> 01:19:02.755
Does that make you
think of suicide?

01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:04.256
Of course.

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:06.092
That's what's so great
about it.

01:19:10.747 --> 01:19:13.299
You know, we sold actual death

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:15.718
for 25 years with Lucky Strike.

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:19.138
You know how we did it?
We ignored it.

01:19:33.976 --> 01:19:35.510
Hold on.

01:19:35.544 --> 01:19:37.245
Can I go to Becky's
for New Year's Eve?

01:19:37.279 --> 01:19:39.647
- Talk to your mother.
- Can't you get a sitter?

01:19:39.682 --> 01:19:42.784
Have your friend come here. You can
bang pots and pans at midnight.

01:19:42.818 --> 01:19:45.136
It's a party. They can't
bring the whole party here.

01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:47.955
I'll stay until 9:00.
I'll put them to bed.

01:19:47.973 --> 01:19:49.507
<i>Hello.</i>

01:19:49.558 --> 01:19:52.060
Ask your mother.
We're in here.

01:19:57.299 --> 01:19:59.484
So?

01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:01.486
Anything new?

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.489
I hate it.
You're ugly.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.977
What happened to you?

01:20:11.163 --> 01:20:12.830
So?

01:20:15.417 --> 01:20:18.119
Elizabeth Taylor,

01:20:18.153 --> 01:20:20.321
what have you done
with my wife?

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.512
You're free until lunch, but I
have to tell you something.

01:20:27.546 --> 01:20:29.130
Just a minute.
What's that?

01:20:29.164 --> 01:20:31.832
More bad news.
Giorgio died.

01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:33.968
His family sent over
his shoeshine kit

01:20:34.002 --> 01:20:35.853
because you were the only
one who called about him.

01:20:35.888 --> 01:20:37.355
What happened to him?

01:20:37.389 --> 01:20:39.273
I didn't ask.

01:21:26.238 --> 01:21:29.607
So the secret is to rub the
pot with a clove of garlic

01:21:29.658 --> 01:21:31.359
and then add twice
the kirschwasser.

01:21:31.393 --> 01:21:34.829
How wonderful that we can
just stagger downstairs.

01:21:36.832 --> 01:21:39.400
I might just get undressed
in the elevator.

01:21:39.418 --> 01:21:41.786
I don't know if I can
make it to midnight,

01:21:41.837 --> 01:21:44.705
but I do know we're not leaving
here until those kids are in bed.

01:21:44.739 --> 01:21:46.591
It's a beautiful fondue pot.

01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:48.576
- Where'd you get it?
- Bloomingdales.

01:21:48.594 --> 01:21:50.711
The kitchen store. They have
everything you could think of.

01:21:50.745 --> 01:21:53.965
Not everything.
Tell the story.

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.802
Well, there's a guy
in my office.

01:21:57.853 --> 01:22:01.639
He's very <i>flamboyant</i>
and he got arrested there.

01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:04.225
- Shoplifting?
- No.

01:22:04.259 --> 01:22:06.310
But he was caught
red-handed.

01:22:06.361 --> 01:22:08.780
Apparently the men's room

01:22:08.814 --> 01:22:11.816
is a locale for a certain
kind of assignation

01:22:11.867 --> 01:22:14.952
and the store detective's always going
in there and looking under the stall.

01:22:14.987 --> 01:22:18.072
So, my regional sales manager

01:22:18.106 --> 01:22:20.575
apparently takes
two shopping bags,

01:22:20.609 --> 01:22:22.443
puts his feet in them

01:22:22.461 --> 01:22:24.829
while the love of his
life sat on the john.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.081
That is clever.

01:22:27.115 --> 01:22:29.884
How the hell did he get caught?

01:22:30.952 --> 01:22:32.786
How old are your children?

01:22:34.173 --> 01:22:36.841
Um, 11 and seven.

01:22:36.892 --> 01:22:39.477
Well, I might go
kiss them good night.

01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:41.512
Ours is a freshman at Michigan.

01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:45.016
- He didn't even come home.
- Oh, I'm not ready for that.

01:22:45.067 --> 01:22:46.984
The house feels empty.

01:22:47.019 --> 01:22:48.686
Then you get a phone bill.

01:22:50.522 --> 01:22:53.024
Well, if everybody's
had enough cheese,

01:22:53.075 --> 01:22:55.142
I'm gonna switch to chocolate.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.031
But first, because it looks
like it's snowing,

01:23:00.082 --> 01:23:03.784
I think it's time
we all took a trip to Hawaii.

01:23:03.818 --> 01:23:06.204
We're having such a good time.

01:23:07.322 --> 01:23:08.822
It's all set up.

01:23:08.841 --> 01:23:10.991
I want to go to Hawaii.

01:23:30.395 --> 01:23:32.196
- Oh!
- Ooh.

01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:34.348
- Isn't it incredible?
- Yeah.

01:23:47.362 --> 01:23:49.697
<i>Oh, let me explain.</i>

01:23:49.715 --> 01:23:53.033
I woke up in the morning
and Don was at a wedding

01:23:53.051 --> 01:23:54.719
giving away the bride.

01:23:54.753 --> 01:23:56.554
That's romantic.

01:23:56.588 --> 01:23:58.256
How did that happen?

01:24:02.928 --> 01:24:05.346
So, of course,
Kreutzer's yelling

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:09.433
and Ginsberg says, "I'm sorry, but
what the hell do I know about ham?"

01:24:11.553 --> 01:24:14.054
How could they let him near clients?
Haven't they learned?

01:24:14.072 --> 01:24:17.909
Hey, do you think Joan and Roger
are still sleeping together?

01:24:17.943 --> 01:24:19.694
Because his mother croaked

01:24:19.728 --> 01:24:21.913
and she completely ignored him.

01:24:21.947 --> 01:24:24.699
I don't know. We don't even know
if that really ever happened.

01:24:24.733 --> 01:24:27.285
I've got pictures in my head.

01:24:27.336 --> 01:24:29.704
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

01:24:29.738 --> 01:24:31.339
- You want some?
- Very funny.

01:24:31.373 --> 01:24:33.040
Hey, I'm not hanging up.

01:24:36.261 --> 01:24:37.911
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:41.248
Ted. What are you
doing here?

01:24:41.266 --> 01:24:44.101
I heard there were four people
in the office on New Year's Eve.

01:24:44.136 --> 01:24:46.387
I figured I owed it to the
team to at least stop by.

01:24:46.421 --> 01:24:48.556
Oh, I'm just--

01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:51.925
there's a--
did you get my message?

01:24:51.944 --> 01:24:54.895
I received them all.
And I apologize,

01:24:54.929 --> 01:24:57.481
but it was sort of a
retreat for my wife and I

01:24:57.532 --> 01:25:00.267
and, well, apparently
I work too much.

01:25:00.285 --> 01:25:03.237
Well, you know the problem.

01:25:03.271 --> 01:25:05.406
Yes.
Any solutions?

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.124
There's one.

01:25:07.159 --> 01:25:09.160
I found this thing.

01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:12.797
- What is this?
- It's an outtake.

01:25:12.831 --> 01:25:16.550
He had his headset on
and was clowning around.

01:25:18.136 --> 01:25:19.620
There's two minutes of it.

01:25:22.891 --> 01:25:25.760
Look at this guy.
What a pain in the ass.

01:25:25.794 --> 01:25:28.312
I was irritated
about it on the day,

01:25:28.347 --> 01:25:31.098
but now I'm a little excited.

01:25:31.132 --> 01:25:33.985
I think you can show him
making these faces,

01:25:34.019 --> 01:25:36.970
with no music,
and say something like,

01:25:36.989 --> 01:25:40.608
"Koss Headphones
sound so sharp and clear,

01:25:40.642 --> 01:25:43.361
you can actually see it."

01:25:45.914 --> 01:25:49.700
It always takes a crisis
to sell work this good.

01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:51.151
You think it's good?

01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:53.320
Makes me smile
more than the original.

01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:58.676
- Do you want to see the new voice-over?
- No.

01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:01.012
Well, I hope
I didn't ruin your evening.

01:26:01.046 --> 01:26:04.632
Not mine, but there's people working
out there, Peggy. It's New Year's Eve.

01:26:04.666 --> 01:26:07.051
If you knew you had something,
you should have let them go.

01:26:07.102 --> 01:26:10.304
- They know they can go.
- No, they don't.

01:26:10.338 --> 01:26:12.356
Oh.

01:26:14.726 --> 01:26:17.194
You're good in a crisis.

01:26:19.614 --> 01:26:21.198
Thank you.

01:26:21.233 --> 01:26:23.567
Happy New Year.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.074
<i>He likes you.</i>

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:32.910
What did you hear?

01:26:32.961 --> 01:26:34.361
All of it.

01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:43.259
This is Galliano.

01:26:43.293 --> 01:26:45.228
It's from Jonesy.

01:26:45.262 --> 01:26:47.864
I'm glad he's giving
presents to someone else.

01:26:47.898 --> 01:26:49.732
I can't stand
the constant bootlicking.

01:26:49.767 --> 01:26:51.334
He's grateful.

01:26:53.303 --> 01:26:55.555
- <i>Cent'anni.</i>
- What does that mean?

01:26:55.589 --> 01:26:57.673
It's Italian for <i>l'chaim.</i>

01:26:57.707 --> 01:26:59.892
It means "100 years."

01:27:05.065 --> 01:27:07.049
What do you think
Dave paid for their place?

01:27:07.067 --> 01:27:09.051
Arnold, don't.

01:27:09.069 --> 01:27:11.554
Fine.
Don, what did you pay?

01:27:11.572 --> 01:27:13.940
75.

01:27:13.991 --> 01:27:16.392
Well, you're a floor
higher than us.

01:27:16.443 --> 01:27:19.779
Jesus.
Syl, did you hear that?

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:21.364
Happy New Year.

01:27:24.752 --> 01:27:27.837
We missed midnight.
It's 1:00.

01:27:27.871 --> 01:27:30.006
We missed it.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.041
It's probably my mother.

01:27:32.075 --> 01:27:33.459
Or Dave and Cathy.

01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:35.962
Face down in the hall.

01:27:36.013 --> 01:27:37.346
Hello?

01:27:39.383 --> 01:27:42.685
Um, Arnie, it's the service.

01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:44.971
Thank you.

01:27:45.022 --> 01:27:46.022
Hello?

01:27:47.941 --> 01:27:49.758
Okay.

01:27:53.363 --> 01:27:55.731
All right, tell them
I'm on my way.

01:27:58.285 --> 01:27:59.602
I've got to go.

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:06.042
I need cigarettes.
I'll walk you down.

01:28:06.076 --> 01:28:08.828
It's 1:00 a.m.
in a snowstorm

01:28:08.879 --> 01:28:10.746
on a holiday on a Sunday.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.331
You are never gonna get a cab.

01:28:12.382 --> 01:28:15.117
Don't even try
to talk him out of it.

01:28:28.798 --> 01:28:31.734
- These them?
- Yeah, you see the boots?

01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:43.579
What is it like to have
someone's life in your hands?

01:28:45.282 --> 01:28:48.534
Well, it's a privilege
and an honor

01:28:48.585 --> 01:28:50.953
to be trusted with
that responsibility.

01:28:53.924 --> 01:28:55.341
There they are.

01:29:03.967 --> 01:29:05.468
Look at that.

01:29:05.502 --> 01:29:08.054
Time to quit smoking.

01:29:08.105 --> 01:29:10.439
It's a good resolution.

01:29:10.474 --> 01:29:12.808
Well...

01:29:12.842 --> 01:29:14.810
that's one lucky patient.

01:29:14.844 --> 01:29:17.563
Honestly, Don, the whole
life-and-death thing,

01:29:17.614 --> 01:29:20.683
it doesn't bother me.
It never has.

01:29:20.701 --> 01:29:23.119
Guys like us,
that's why we get paid.

01:29:23.153 --> 01:29:25.454
- Us?
- Fine.

01:29:25.489 --> 01:29:27.690
You get paid to think about things
they don't want to think about

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:30.859
and I get paid
to not think about them.

01:29:30.878 --> 01:29:33.713
People will do anything
to alleviate their anxiety.

01:30:31.188 --> 01:30:33.222
Did you read my Dante?

01:30:34.758 --> 01:30:37.059
It made me think of you.

01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:42.398
I don't know how to take that.

01:30:44.034 --> 01:30:46.268
It's beautiful.

01:31:16.233 --> 01:31:18.300
What do you want for this year?

01:31:20.237 --> 01:31:22.971
I want to stop doing this.

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.111
I know.
