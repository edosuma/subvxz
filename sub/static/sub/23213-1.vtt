07:25.600 --> 07:27.720

towards my office.

on his way upstairs.

release that information.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.480
That's Pearl's room there.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.560
She'd locked
herself in, all right.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.640
(SIGHS)

12:42.520 --> 12:44.800
She was barely
more than a child herself.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.000
But why dig up the story now,
30 years later?

12:48.080 --> 12:49.760
Here's the text to Philip.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.600
"I can't live with myself.
I'm sorry."

12:52.680 --> 12:54.160
Sent at 5:55 p.m.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.360
Florence, you're a woman.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.040
(CHUCKLES) Yes, sir, I am.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.360
From what I recall
of my wife's dressing table,

13:02.440 --> 13:04.400
leaving a lid
off a nail varnish bottle...

13:04.480 --> 13:05.720
I mean, that's
practically a crime.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.200
(SCOFFS) Of course.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.000
The liquid sets if you don't
screw the lid down tight.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.360
It becomes... How do you say it?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.800
-Gloopy.
-Gloopy. Exactly.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.880
So if she was planning
to kill herself,

13:16.960 --> 13:18.960
surely she'd have taken
a little bit more time

13:19.040 --> 13:20.400
to finish her nails.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.880
I mean, look around.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.840
She was a tidy person.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.520
Not the sort of woman
to leave a cap unscrewed.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.560
But if she was interrupted?

13:28.640 --> 13:30.320
You don't think
it was a suicide.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.640
No, I'm convinced
Diane Smith was murdered.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.440
Because of one fingernail?

13:36.360 --> 13:37.320
Exactly.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.040
(BLOWING RASPBERRY)

13:43.960 --> 13:45.640
No one seems
to have seen anything.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.560
I mean, how is that even poss...

13:50.560 --> 13:51.720
Dwayne, what are you doing?

13:52.720 --> 13:53.840
I'm not here.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.360
JP: What are you talking about?

13:55.440 --> 13:56.600
I said I'm not here.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.520
But you are. I can see you.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.480
Not as long as that woman
is coming this way, you can't.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.760
Now, act natural.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.760
Dwayne Myers, is that you?

14:07.840 --> 14:10.400
Uh, I'm sorry, um, Dwayne who?

14:13.400 --> 14:14.960
He's behind that bush.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.720
Nope, nothing in there, JP.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.800
Oh, Audrey.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.560
Fancy seeing you here.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.600
So...

14:24.680 --> 14:27.720
(STAMMERING) How have you been
keeping these last few years?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.600
Tell that man
that if I never see him again,

14:30.680 --> 14:32.480
it'll be too soon.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.400
I get it now.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.400
She's the reason
you've been acting so weird
since we got here.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.480
No way, Sherlock.
You worked it out.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.560
(CHUCKLES) But what's
she got against you?

14:45.640 --> 14:47.280
Let's just say we have history.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.520
Now, let's get out of here,
and fast.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.840
You are saying, despite all
evidence to the contrary,

14:55.920 --> 14:58.160
you don't believe Diane
took her own life?

14:58.240 --> 14:59.640
No.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.160
And just so I am clear,

15:02.240 --> 15:05.000
you have no concrete evidence
to support this theory?

15:05.080 --> 15:06.800
Not as yet, no.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.000
Philip Marston confirmed

15:08.080 --> 15:10.240
that the door was locked
on the inside

15:10.320 --> 15:11.600
and Diane was alone.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.600
It seems pretty clear to me.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.560
I think it's time
to wrap this up.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.400
Trust me, Commissioner.
I'd love to knock it on the head

15:19.480 --> 15:20.560
and get back to the shack

15:20.640 --> 15:22.520
and discover the joys
of melon curry.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.320
But what if Diane Smith
was murdered?

15:24.400 --> 15:27.320
To be honest, I don't know
if I could live with that.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.160
On your head be it,
Detective Inspector.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.160
Commissioner.
Okay, we're all done here.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.920
Nothing to report.
See you at the station.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.840
Hold on, Dwayne.
We're changing tack.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.480
This is now
a murder investigation.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.040
Murder?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.560
(SCOFFS)
Are you sure about this?

15:43.640 --> 15:45.960
Oh, yes. Diane Smith's room
is now a potential crime scene.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.440
I need a full forensic sweep.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.960
There's a head maid...
Audrey, I think her name is.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.880
She'll help you
get set up in there.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.000
Hey, where are you going?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.440
You heard the man.
Go and speak to Audrey.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.840
He asked you.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.520
Well, I'm delegating.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.200
We have 130 guests.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.720
Do we need to consider them
all suspects?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.880
Well, it's likely
whoever killed Diane

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
wanted to stop this wedding
at all costs.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.440
Who'd be most affected by her
becoming a Marston?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.160
One of the immediate family?

16:18.040 --> 16:19.120
Has to be.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.080
JACK: Karen was on
the terrace giving a speech.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.160
Stephen was in his room
getting ready and...

16:29.240 --> 16:31.160
Dad, there's something
I need to...

16:31.240 --> 16:33.560
Pearl was in her bathroom.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.000
-Dad.
-Hmm?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.200
-Sorry, love. Yes. What is it?
-(CHUCKLES)

16:37.280 --> 16:38.760
Are you gonna be
working all night?

16:38.840 --> 16:40.600
-It's just...
-What time is it?

16:40.680 --> 16:42.080
You must be starving.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.040
I'm so sorry, love.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.400
The plan was I was going to try

16:45.480 --> 16:47.200
this new recipe
I got from Catherine.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.160
-Melon curry, yeah.
-Mmm.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.960
If you can believe that.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.480
Well, I had to use the melon
to arrest the drug mule,

16:53.560 --> 16:55.560
and Florence thinks
it might be evidence so...

16:55.640 --> 16:57.120
I'm not even going to ask.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.040
Wise. Tell you what.
Why don't we go out?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.240
Okay.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.320
Come on.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.280
(SIGHS)

17:04.360 --> 17:06.200
JACK: So, what's on your mind?

17:06.280 --> 17:09.480
You remember our summer holidays
on the west coast?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.320
How I never wanted them to end?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.920
Your mum and I
had to practically

17:13.000 --> 17:14.240
force you into the car.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.240
And you were crying
the whole way back to London.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.160
Then, next day,
you're with your friends,

17:18.240 --> 17:19.600
happy as Larry again.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.600
What made you think of that?

17:23.320 --> 17:26.240
This arrived this morning.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.200
They need to know if I'm gonna
defer my place for another year.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.720
Right. And when do you need
to decide by?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.600
Tomorrow.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.120
Well, there's no decision
to be made.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.280
You're far too smart to waste
that brain of yours

17:44.360 --> 17:45.840
sitting on a beach.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.280
When will you need to leave?

17:47.360 --> 17:50.640
There's a flight from Guadalupe
the day after tomorrow.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.640
Wow! I thought you were gonna
say a couple of months.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.040
Where will you stay?
You'll need money.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.160
Well, Auntie Eileen says
I can stay with her

17:59.240 --> 18:01.240
until I find a flat share.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.240
Sounds like you've got it
all worked out.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.200
Catherine, guess whose
brilliant daughter

18:07.280 --> 18:09.440
is about to take up a place
at university?

18:10.160 --> 18:11.280
You're leaving us?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.200
CATHERINE: No. (CHUCKLES)

18:13.280 --> 18:15.080
Well, I'll be back
in the holidays.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.040
Your father's going to miss you.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.040
Ah, you're joking.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.040
I've had enough of her
cramping my style

18:21.120 --> 18:22.520
and getting under my feet.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.800
(CHUCKLES)

18:23.880 --> 18:25.200
Thought she'd never leave.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.440
All right, thanks anyway.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.360
Yeah, appreciate your time.

18:34.440 --> 18:38.440
You immoral, spineless,
parasitic, bottom-feeding hack.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.160
That was the journalist
who wrote the story about Diane?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.800
"Journalist" is too polite
a word for what he is.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.560
Not a shred of remorse.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.520
He said the story came
from an anonymous tip-off,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.440
just landed on his desk.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.160
Someone is trying
to discredit Diane, but why?

18:54.240 --> 18:56.360
Maybe they wanted
to drive her to suicide.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.920
Or maybe they wanted
to give her a motive

18:58.000 --> 18:59.520
to make it look like suicide.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.600
(SIGHS)

19:00.680 --> 19:02.880
Sir, are you all right?

19:03.880 --> 19:06.120
You seem a little... edgy.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.560
Do I? Sorry. No, I'm fine.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.600
(SIGHS)

19:10.680 --> 19:13.320
I mean, Siobhan's leaving
the island tomorrow but...

19:14.440 --> 19:15.440
Tomorrow?

19:15.520 --> 19:16.880
It's a good thing.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.680
Uh, she's going to uni.
I'm happy for her. I really am.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.880
Yeah, really, really
happy for her.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.320
Right, we're dealing
with a family of billionaires.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.520
Let's not overlook the obvious.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.560
Dwayne, JP,
see what you can glean

19:27.640 --> 19:29.520
about the personal finances
of these five.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.520
Yes, sir.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.240
Right, what do we have so far
about Diane Smith?

19:35.320 --> 19:38.080
Only child.
Parents died years ago.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.800
She joined the Marston group

19:39.880 --> 19:43.240
as the head of HR
three years ago.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.280
Before then, she worked
in a number of hotels in London.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.760
Her CV is pretty
impressive, though.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.360
Always getting promoted.
Working her way up.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.600
A grafter.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.120
A workaholic.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.440
She even arranged an appointment
the morning of her wedding, sir.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.520
With who?

20:03.880 --> 20:06.040
"Chris C, 9:30."

20:06.120 --> 20:08.160
Could have been about
the wedding preparations.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.800
Maybe. Well, let's find out
who this Chris C is.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.640
Right. Even though
we don't yet have a how,

20:12.720 --> 20:14.600
the question is,
why did one of these people

20:14.680 --> 20:17.360
want Diane Smith to die
the night before her wedding?

20:17.440 --> 20:20.040
That is if we really believe
it was a murder.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.000
Oh, ye of little faith.
Dwayne, I'll tell you what.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.480
Prove me wrong, you'll never
have to buy me a beer again.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.640
You're on.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.800
(SIGHS)

20:29.880 --> 20:30.920
What about
the children's mother?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.120
The first Mrs Marston.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.160
Died 15 years ago. Cancer.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.720
Karen is the oldest.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.120
She became managing director
of the Marston Group

20:39.200 --> 20:40.920
when she was 20 years old.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.600
People now see it as much
as her company as her father's.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.680
When I was 20,
I was eating banana sandwiches

20:46.760 --> 20:48.200
and watching Crackerjack!

20:49.880 --> 20:52.760
Stephen is the company's
global brand ambassador,

20:52.840 --> 20:55.120
which, as far as I can tell,

20:55.200 --> 20:56.480
means he travels the world

20:56.560 --> 20:59.200
staying as a guest
in his own hotels.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.320
And what about her?
Pearl, the youngest.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.960
FLORENCE: Left school at 16.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.520
Tried her hand as an actress,
did a few bit parts

21:05.600 --> 21:06.880
and some modelling work.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.680
In other words,
she lives off her rich daddy.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.040
Totes.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.920
Means totally.
I checked with Siobhan.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.720
Although, sir, there is a rota
in Ms Smith's papers

21:15.800 --> 21:17.000
for Pearl Marston

21:17.080 --> 21:18.960
to do work experience
in the group's hotel.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.120
Oh, sounds like Daddy's
putting his foot down.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.440
And there's something else.
We ran a PNC check

21:25.520 --> 21:28.160
and five weeks ago,
Diane Smith called the police

21:28.240 --> 21:30.000
when a woman
was banging on her door.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.400
Shouting abuse.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.680
Who was doing the shouting?

21:34.280 --> 21:35.680
Pearl Marston.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.760
PEARL: This won't
take long, will it?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.200
If I don't get this
massage soon,

21:41.280 --> 21:42.840
I am literally gonna die.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.800
JACK: Oh, sorry about that.
But can you tell me,

21:44.880 --> 21:47.080
how did you feel about Diane
becoming your stepmother?

21:48.200 --> 21:50.720
She was never gonna be that.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.240
That's what you were
arguing about

21:52.320 --> 21:53.720
the day you turned up
on her doorstep.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.200
That was nothing.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.200
(CHUCKLES)
She totes overreacted.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.840
It wasn't like I was a threat.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.400
Well, she must've
felt threatened.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.600
Why would she call the police?

22:02.680 --> 22:04.160
To show me up to Dad.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.960
Diane never liked me.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.240
She thought I was lazy

22:07.320 --> 22:10.320
just because I don't have
a job or whatevs.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.720
So she thought you should go
to work for the family firm?

22:12.800 --> 22:14.840
Hey, I do work
for the family firm.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.600
I'm a Marston.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.520
I'm promoting the brand
every time I post online.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.760
What did she think
I was gonna do?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.680
Put on a uniform
and serve people? (SCOFFS)

22:23.760 --> 22:26.160
She couldn't let it go,
you know what I mean?

22:26.240 --> 22:27.200
Totes.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.720
Yeah, I mean, totally.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.520
FLORENCE:
Pearl, what do you think

22:32.600 --> 22:34.680
might've driven Diane
to take her own life?

22:35.440 --> 22:36.800
It was the article.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.240
I mean, that's what tipped her
over the edge, wasn't it?

22:39.320 --> 22:42.440
Well, possibly an unfortunate
choice of words,

22:42.520 --> 22:44.040
under the circumstances.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.640
Thanks. Understood.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.920
That was Dwayne.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
There is no sign of a Chris C
on the guest list,

22:57.080 --> 22:59.800
in Diane's phone,
or on the hotel staff.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.160
Hmm.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.600
They've also been looking
into the Marston finances,

23:03.680 --> 23:06.160
but their contents
are refusing
to disclose anything.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.200
Well, you don't get
to be this rich

23:08.280 --> 23:10.680
without knowing
how to hide your assets.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.960
Who else would have access
to this information?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.360
Maybe their lawyers.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.240
Yes. Exactly.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.200
Family's lawyer was on
the guest list for the wedding.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.240
Bet he's kicking his heels
by the pool right now.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.360
You should go and talk to him.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.760
-Why me?
-(SIGHS)

23:23.840 --> 23:25.520
Because I've just noticed
something vitally important.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.760
Look, Florence, Vasco da Gama.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.080
Sir.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.440
Marco Polo. Come on.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.800
-Where are we going?
-To find Christopher Columbus.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.000
Would you excuse me, ma'am?

23:39.440 --> 23:40.600
Morning of her death,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.720
Diane had a note in her diary,
"Chris C. 9:30."

23:43.800 --> 23:45.640
Chris C wasn't who
she was meeting, it was where.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.000
Christopher Columbus suite.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.640
So my question to you, sir,

23:49.720 --> 23:51.200
is who booked the room
for that time?

23:51.280 --> 23:52.520
Who was Diane meeting?

23:53.400 --> 23:55.720
I'm afraid there was no meeting.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.640
You haven't even
checked the system.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.880
As general manager,
I personally oversaw

23:59.960 --> 24:01.560
every last detail
of this wedding.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.520
I know what was scheduled
in every room in the hotel,

24:03.600 --> 24:05.240
down to the last minute.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.440
And I can assure you, there was
no meeting in that room

24:07.520 --> 24:08.640
at that time.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.400
Oh, I see.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.120
Well, we'll just have to take
your word for it.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.320
Thanks.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.280
Do you believe him?

24:16.360 --> 24:17.520
Not for one second.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.760
(SIGHS)

24:27.200 --> 24:28.600
So come on, Dwayne.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.360
This suspense is killing me.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.920
You've got to tell me what
happened between you and Audrey.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.440
And which Audrey would this be?

24:35.520 --> 24:36.960
You know.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.240
"If I never see that man again,
it will be too soon" Audrey.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.840
-Oh, that Audrey.
-Hmm.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.160
So is she an old girlfriend?

24:45.240 --> 24:47.760
Girlfriend is too strong
a word, okay?

24:47.840 --> 24:50.000
We went out with each other
for a couple of months

24:50.080 --> 24:51.640
around 10 years ago,
that is all.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.480
Boy, that woman is angry.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.280
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
what did you do to her?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.040
-I don't know.
-You don't?

24:59.120 --> 25:02.280
No, seriously. I have no idea.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.200
I mean, I can understand her
being upset at losing me.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.480
She's only human.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.480
But this woman went crazy.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.400
She went around telling anyone
who would listen

25:10.480 --> 25:12.000
that if she ever saw me again,

25:12.080 --> 25:14.560
she would cut off parts of me
I'd rather keep.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.000
Well... (SCOFFS) If that was me,

25:17.080 --> 25:19.080
I'd want to know what I'd done
to upset her.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.960
JP, whenever a woman
is concerned,

25:22.040 --> 25:23.600
don't ever ask them
why they're angry.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.600
It never ends well.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.120
Ah, perfect timing.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.080
So...

25:29.160 --> 25:31.280
After I had no luck
with the Marston accountants,

25:31.360 --> 25:32.480
I decided to run a check

25:32.560 --> 25:34.760
on all the currency exchanges
on the island.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.880
Smart thinking, Dwayne.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.240
And I just received this.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.000
Three days before
the death of Ms Smith,

25:40.080 --> 25:43.280
Stephen Marston took $20,000
out of the bureau de change

25:43.360 --> 25:45.600
in Port Louis,
on the other side of the island.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.440
Twenty thousand dollars,
that's a lot of cash.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.280
Drive over there,
find out what you can.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.600
-Will do.
-(COMPUTER CHIMES)

25:50.680 --> 25:53.040
Oh, sir, the PM's in.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.240
JACK: Great. What does it say?

25:55.320 --> 25:58.480
"Massive blunt force trauma
to the head and neck.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.520
"Consistent with a fall
from a considerable height."

26:02.600 --> 26:04.600
There's no mention
of any other abrasions

26:04.680 --> 26:07.120
or cuts to the skin pre-mortem,

26:07.200 --> 26:09.840
no fibres or skin
under her fingernails.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.960
No defence wounds?

26:12.320 --> 26:13.960
No, sir.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.720
-(SIGHS)
-DWAYNE: So...

26:15.800 --> 26:18.440
Nothing that suggests
she was pushed, eh?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.520
(SIGHS) Nothing that proves
she wasn't.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.560
I don't know what you thought
you were playing at.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.640
Pearl is a child,
a sensitive child.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.440
She's just lost her stepmother,
for God's sake,

26:29.520 --> 26:30.840
and there you are
making all kinds of...

26:30.920 --> 26:32.160
All I want, Mr Marston,

26:32.240 --> 26:34.120
is to make absolutely sure
we know the full truth.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.040
Now, I believe Diane
deserves nothing less.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.320
We know what happened.
I was there.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.800
I saw it with my own two eyes.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.960
You knew Diane. I didn't.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.880
But from what little I do know,

26:43.960 --> 26:46.760
I struggle to believe
that she would take her own life

26:46.840 --> 26:48.880
because of some rubbish
written in a newspaper.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.360
Oh, it wasn't just
the article, it was...

26:51.440 --> 26:54.000
30 years of guilt and shame
she'd been holding in.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.800
Even then, Mr Marston.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.520
Forgive me.
Now, the last thing I want to do

26:57.600 --> 26:58.880
is add to your suffering.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.000
All I ever wanted was to bring
this family together.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.480
I'm a very wealthy man.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.200
But she couldn't care less
about the money.

27:06.280 --> 27:09.360
She loved me in spite of it,
not because of it.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.000
And she was prepared
to take it all on.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.320
The name,
the attention, my kids.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.560
It can't have been easy for her.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.960
No, it wasn't.
It was bloody awful.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.280
But she hung on in there.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.600
And they all came
to love her in the end.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.960
Even Pearl.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.560
Although I understand
they were arguing

27:24.640 --> 27:26.360
over Pearl joining the company.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.640
You have children?

27:29.320 --> 27:30.480
I have a daughter.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.400
Then you know all too well
the delicate balance

27:32.480 --> 27:33.840
between doing what they want

27:33.920 --> 27:35.560
and doing what's best for them
in the long term.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.720
Diane understood that,
just as I do.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.920
Of course.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.920
Now, I know you think
you have a job to do,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.760
but this family
has suffered enough.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.720
Diane took her own life.
End of story.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.360
So you will drop
this investigation right now.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.320
I'm glad we understand
each other.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.560
FLORENCE: What was
he doing here?

28:08.640 --> 28:11.040
Um, nothing, no, just...

28:11.120 --> 28:12.400
(CLEARING THROAT)
He just wanted to know

28:12.480 --> 28:14.800
how the investigation
was going, so...

28:14.880 --> 28:16.440
How'd you get on
with the lawyer?

28:16.520 --> 28:19.680
He'd been in the sun drinking
cocktails since breakfast,

28:19.760 --> 28:22.120
so it wasn't hard
to get him talking.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.440
I even persuaded him
to print out a copy of this

28:25.520 --> 28:26.840
on the hotel computer.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.960
What's this?
A prenuptial agreement.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.560
Apparently, it caused
a big family rift.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.240
Diane refused to sign it,
with Philip's blessing.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.920
So who did want her to sign it?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.600
Who had this drawn up
in the first place?

28:39.680 --> 28:42.080
The managing director,
Karen Marston.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.200
JACK: Afternoon, Ms Marston.
Could we have a word?

28:52.280 --> 28:53.680
Not right now. I'm on a timer.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.280
Ah, it's police business,
I'm afraid.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.120
You could always run beside me.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.400
(CHUCKLES) You must be joking.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.760
We'd need a team of paramedics
and an ambulance.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.800
(JACK SIGHS)

29:10.520 --> 29:12.440
So they tell me
that you're the real brains

29:12.520 --> 29:13.720
of the Marston clan.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.120
You've met my siblings.
I'm the only brains.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.600
So it all rests on you.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.880
Quite a burden to have thrust
upon you at the age of 22.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.920
I dragged Dad
kicking and screaming

29:24.000 --> 29:25.600
into the 21st century.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.440
When I started,
we were still serving

29:27.520 --> 29:29.080
fish fingers and chips
in the restaurants.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.600
Now we have three Michelin stars
across the group.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.680
You must be very proud
of what you've achieved.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.680
I am.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.280
And Diane wasn't just
your father's fiancee,

29:38.360 --> 29:40.040
she was also your head of HR.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.400
I hired her.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.960
So you trusted her enough

29:43.040 --> 29:44.760
to take a key role
in your business.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.080
Yes.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.080
But not enough to let
your father marry her

29:48.160 --> 29:49.520
without signing a prenup.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.120
(SIGHS) It wasn't personal.

29:54.200 --> 29:57.040
I have a duty
to protect our company,

29:57.120 --> 29:58.480
to protect my father.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.040
Did he need protecting?

30:00.120 --> 30:01.640
He was leaving himself
wide open.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.200
He was leaving us wide open.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.480
Yet he took her side.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.280
Now, that must've been hurtful.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.640
You've given your whole life
to this company,

30:08.720 --> 30:11.520
and he was prepared to risk
everything for her.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.920
A woman you'd hired.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.480
I don't know
what you're implying,

30:15.560 --> 30:17.160
but I suggest
you tread carefully.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.920
This conversation's on tape,
and we have excellent lawyers.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.800
I can't believe
she threatened to sue you,

30:23.880 --> 30:26.480
just because
she didn't like your questions.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.360
(SCOFFS) What a family.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.800
Well, you know what they say.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.760
If you want to know what God
thinks of money,

30:31.840 --> 30:33.760
look at who he gives it to.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.360
Dwayne, JP, how did you get on
at Port Louis?

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
Well, sir, we went
to the bureau de change,

30:39.520 --> 30:42.240
and the lady actually remembers
serving Stephen Marston.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.760
When he got the 20,000,

30:43.840 --> 30:45.920
he got back into the taxi
and drove off.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.240
Any idea where he went?

30:47.320 --> 30:49.080
We found the taxi driver
he used.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.920
He took him to an address
up in the hills.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.080
Number 4, Rue Duplessis.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.840
But no one was in.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.120
Who lives at 4 Rue Duplessis?

30:57.200 --> 30:59.760
Well, it's owned by a woman
called Julie Francois.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.240
But we checked the address
and no one was home.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.720
Well, whoever she is,

31:04.800 --> 31:07.320
why was Stephen
delivering $20,000?

31:07.840 --> 31:09.640
Blackmail?

31:09.720 --> 31:13.000
Hmm, or did she play some part
in Diane's death?

31:13.080 --> 31:15.160
Either way, let's try her house
again in the morning.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.160
So this is Siobhan's last night
on the island.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.480
Hmm.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.080
I hope you're planning
something special, you know?

31:24.160 --> 31:26.680
Send her back to London
with a Caribbean glow.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.040
Oh, yeah. I thought I might
make dinner at the shack.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.160
Got this great recipe
for melon curry.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.600
What?

31:35.240 --> 31:36.480
All due respect,

31:36.560 --> 31:39.760
I think you can do
a bit better than that.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.640
Well, which part?
The melon curry or...

31:41.720 --> 31:43.480
-Both.
-The whole thing.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.720
Hmm. What do you suggest?

31:45.800 --> 31:48.120
I mean, Siobhan said she wanted
to do something that captures

31:48.200 --> 31:49.440
the essence of the Caribbean.

-Dwayne.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.280
(CHUCKLES)

32:02.360 --> 32:04.480
How can she still be angry
after 10 years?

32:05.680 --> 32:07.320
Who holds a grudge that long?

32:08.800 --> 32:10.000
What did I do?

32:10.080 --> 32:12.280
Well, if the thing
is still bothering you,

32:12.360 --> 32:14.160
why don't you go
and talk to her?

32:14.240 --> 32:15.360
-Are you mad?
-(SCOFFS)

32:15.440 --> 32:17.280
You saw the way
she was looking at me.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.120
If looks could kill,

32:19.200 --> 32:21.120
my photo would be up
on that whiteboard right now

32:21.200 --> 32:22.680
with the Inspector
circling her name.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.160
Then suit yourself.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.320
Okay? As long as you're happy
to go the rest of your life

32:26.400 --> 32:27.600

You're gonna miss her.

It's a funny old thing.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.600
I knew it was coming.

32:38.680 --> 32:42.280
Just don't think I admitted
to myself it'd be so soon.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.920
I was the same with Camille.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.240
You spend all this time
teaching them to be independent

32:49.320 --> 32:52.200
and then wonder
why they want to leave.

it's not us
who cut the apron strings.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.640
It's them.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.880
You're right.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.360
Siobhan's been independent since
she was about three years old.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.240
And I'm the one who, well...

33:09.320 --> 33:10.560
I've never lived
on my own before.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.280
-Put it that way.
-Oh.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.880
Dad, it's your turn.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.520
No, no, I don't think so.

through Diane's laptop.

It's all work files.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.640
I just checked the CV
for Oliver Fitzwarren,

34:00.720 --> 34:03.480
the hotel manager, and look.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.840
Before this job,
he'd never worked in a hotel.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.840
Looks like he's a failed banker.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.400
So how did he get the gig?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.880
He and Stephen Marston

Yes, just a slight
limbo-related injury. (CHUCKLES)

34:31.920 --> 34:33.520
Speaking of low bars,

34:33.600 --> 34:36.720
would you mind explaining
why I spent much of last night

34:36.800 --> 34:40.320
talking Philip Marston out of
launching an official complaint?

34:40.400 --> 34:42.280
-Come on, that's absurd.
-No.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.160
No, no, no, no.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.560
What is absurd is that

34:47.640 --> 34:50.360
even when Mr Marston
asked you to step back,

34:50.440 --> 34:52.760
you persisted in
haranguing his children

34:52.840 --> 34:54.720
with these baseless theories.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.760
Haranguing? That's... No.
That's completely unfair now.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.720
You have yet to show me
a single piece of evidence

35:00.800 --> 35:04.400
which suggests Diane Smith
didn't take her own life.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.080
We're working on it.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.960
We just need a bit more time.

Unless you present me
with something tangible

35:12.280 --> 35:13.560
by the end of the day,

35:13.640 --> 35:16.040
I'm overruling you
and closing this case down.

you have something.

I have something.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.960
Thanks, but that didn't help.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.000
No, I really have something.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.360
I found it in a folder
marked "wedding admin."

That's clearly Oliver.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.360
and Stephen's old school friend.

Me and Dwayne are back

36:19.480 --> 36:21.200
and it's still all locked up.

But we found a neighbour
who knows her.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.120
She says that she lives here
on her own.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.720
And, check this.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.280
She works at the Marston Hotel
as a maid.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.080
Why would Stephen be visiting
a hotel maid with $20,000?

36:33.160 --> 36:34.440
It's a hell of a tip.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.760
Dwayne's got an ex-girlfriend
there. Audrey Lefevre.

And I bet she'll give us
every information

36:39.400 --> 36:42.680

Ms Francois, if we ask nicely.

for insider trading.

pulled some strings.

to a police officer

37:26.560 --> 37:27.880
is a criminal offence?

All right, look.
It wasn't about me, it was...

37:33.560 --> 37:35.320

37:35.400 --> 37:37.600
What was the statement
she wanted you to sign?

37:37.680 --> 37:40.600

formal charges against him.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.680
What kind of charges?

37:47.760 --> 37:51.360
The last time Stephen was here,
he had, uh, an encounter

37:51.440 --> 37:52.680
with one of our maids.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.000
It was just Stephen
being Stephen.

of all proportion.

This maid, was her name,
by any chance, Julie Francois?

38:03.560 --> 38:06.560
Did Stephen Marston know
that his future stepmother

38:06.640 --> 38:07.760
was about to bring a charge

38:07.840 --> 38:09.400
of sexual harassment
against him?

38:10.200 --> 38:11.320
Of course, he did.

for the seaside.

Too bad. Mmm.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.440
Still, though, drop by anytime,
mention my name,

38:36.520 --> 38:37.720
you'll be looked after.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.080
You know what I was wondering?

38:40.160 --> 38:42.720
What exactly does a global
brand ambassador do?

38:42.800 --> 38:44.560
Uh, much as it sounds.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.600
They call it "snagging"
in the trade.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.120
I make sure
everything's up to scratch,

to the curtains.

All right,
whatever you've heard,

39:06.280 --> 39:07.560
it wasn't how she said.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.160
-No?
-No.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.040
You didn't try
to force yourself on her?

39:11.440 --> 39:12.720
No, I...

39:12.800 --> 39:14.080
Look, I wasn't trying
to frighten her,

39:14.160 --> 39:15.160
it was just a bit of fun.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.360
I was drunk, it was...

39:16.440 --> 39:19.120
Oh, well, that makes it fine.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.000
You were aware
that Diane was trying

39:21.080 --> 39:22.360
to bring charges against you?

39:22.440 --> 39:24.960
Bless her. Diane was typical HR.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.240
Such a stickler for procedure.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.200
Had she told your father?

39:29.480 --> 39:30.600
No.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.480
He'd have taken it
in his stride.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.800
He's a man of the world.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.080
JACK: Are you sure about that?

39:35.160 --> 39:37.320
Because it strikes me
that assaulting maids

39:37.400 --> 39:39.760
is not exactly on brand.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.640
If this had come out,
you'd have lost your job.

39:41.720 --> 39:42.840
If you can call it a job.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.800
It's a lifestyle.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.880
We know what you were willing
to do to buy Julie's silence.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.920
Pay $20,000.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.360
But how were you planning
to silence Diane?

39:57.840 --> 40:00.640
No. No, I didn't, um...

40:00.720 --> 40:02.400
All right,
we had our differences,

40:02.480 --> 40:04.080
but I did not want her to die.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.760
JACK: Karen,
the eldest daughter.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.400
Frustrated by Diane's refusal
to sign a prenup.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.040
Scared of losing
half her company.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.200
But that would only happen
if they divorced.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.760
And there's nothing to suggest
that was on the cards.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.200
Not to mention the 130 witnesses
that can place her at the party.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.480
Stephen, the son.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.600
Desperate to contain
a sexual assault charge.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.520
But he tried to buy Julie off.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.760
(SIGHS)

40:31.240 --> 40:33.000
Pearl, the youngest daughter.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.800
And even I'd be
hard pushed to suggest

40:34.880 --> 40:36.920
a fear of work experience
is a motive for murder.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.000
Sir, even if we had a motive,

40:41.080 --> 40:43.840
we still come back
to the same question.

40:43.920 --> 40:47.840
Diane was alone in her room
with the door on the chain.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.840
She sent a final text message.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.720
Philip heard her call out and...

40:51.800 --> 40:54.200
An entire hotel worth of guests
saw her land on the terrace.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.960
I know, I know, I know.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.800
(SIGHS)

41:10.680 --> 41:12.040
Be good enough
to call the Commissioner,

41:12.120 --> 41:13.200
would you, Florence?

41:13.880 --> 41:15.680
Tell him

41:15.760 --> 41:17.760
the Diane Smith case is closed.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.200
(GRUNTING)

41:26.280 --> 41:27.840
Looks like I'll never
have to buy another beer

41:27.920 --> 41:29.080
for the rest of my life.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.200
Here, you shouldn't be
doing that.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.440
No, it's fine.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.840
I'm a big girl.
I can carry my own suitcases.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.760
You won't forget to feed Harry?

41:41.840 --> 41:42.880
Who's Harry?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.560
I know you love him, really.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.600
Let's just say we've come
to an understanding.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.160
I mash up his mango

41:48.240 --> 41:50.040
and he doesn't sneak up on me
in the shower,

41:50.120 --> 41:51.720
when I'm most vulnerable.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.120
Besides, the more I look at him,

41:53.200 --> 41:54.880
the more he reminds me
of your Auntie Bridget.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.480
-Thick-skinned?
-No.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.360
Beady eyes and bandy legs.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.080
And the sneaking up
on me in the shower.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.200

I'm gonna miss you.

42:08.920 --> 42:11.200
I'll miss you too.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.600
Listen, you don't need to come
with me to the airport.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.560
No, I'd like to, of course.

42:15.640 --> 42:19.120
Why? Either way,
we've got to say goodbye.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.520
It's nicer to do it here

42:20.600 --> 42:22.720
than in some horrible
departure lounge.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.200
Text me as soon as you land.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.440
-I will.
-Yeah.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.720
-Don't forget, now.
-(CHUCKLES)

42:35.320 --> 42:37.040
-I love you, Dad.
-Oh, shut up.

Don't start me off.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.480

the Diane Smith case.

in the end.

You're hungry?

43:42.680 --> 43:44.640
Well, that's not
my problem now, is it?

43:46.240 --> 43:47.720
Fine, all right.

43:47.800 --> 43:48.960
But just a snack.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.160
It's like she was never here.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.360
She was never here.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.160
I was in my room,
getting ready for the party.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.320
I barged the door open.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.320
I was in my room
across the corridor.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
I was at the party.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.800
Where is it?

44:23.200 --> 44:25.680
Look, Florence.
It's the room list.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.000
Look at the numbers.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.720
(LAUGHS)

44:29.800 --> 44:31.000
Do you see it yet?

44:31.080 --> 44:32.680
I'm sorry, sir. See what?

44:32.760 --> 44:34.240
Who killed Diane Smith.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.960
DWAYNE: Afternoon.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.360
DI Mooney would like you all
to join him on the terrace.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.200
Oh, for God's sake.
What is it now?

44:41.280 --> 44:43.360
We've got some fresh information
about the death of Ms Smith.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.120
Well, I can't come.
I've got a Pilates class.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.920
No, no, come on. Let's hear

44:49.000 --> 44:50.480
what he has to say
for himself this time.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.920
You go if you want.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.880
I've had enough of that man
and his ridiculous theories.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.440
I need to check
on the refurb in Miami.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.800
Where's Karen?

45:02.880 --> 45:05.080
She was called away to a meeting
at the last minute. Miami.

Selwyn, what is this?
Why's my daughter in handcuffs?

45:43.560 --> 45:45.320
I was wondering about that.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.920
I apologise for the delay.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.400
I find it always holds things up

45:49.480 --> 45:51.400
when one of your suspects
tries to do a runner.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.520
Suspect? I hope you're not
implying that my daughter...

45:53.600 --> 45:55.680
I'm not implying anything,
Mr Marston.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.360
I'm stating clearly
and categorically

45:57.440 --> 45:58.800
and for the avoidance of doubt

45:58.880 --> 46:02.400
that Diane Smith's killer
is sitting right here.

46:02.480 --> 46:03.840
-Killer, what?
-(SCOFFS)

46:03.920 --> 46:06.320
We all know the night she died,
Diane was troubled

46:06.400 --> 46:08.880
after a nasty story appeared
in the British press,

46:08.960 --> 46:10.080
dragging up her past.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.880
We can only imagine
her state of mind

46:14.960 --> 46:16.200
as she was getting ready.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.000
Sitting there, steeling herself
to face everyone.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.600
Painting her fingernails.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.280
She only managed
to paint one nail,

46:23.240 --> 46:25.080
her left thumb,

46:25.160 --> 46:26.600
when there was a knock
on the door.

46:27.880 --> 46:29.560
Now, she got up to answer it.

46:29.640 --> 46:32.280
She didn't even replace
the lid on the bottle,

46:32.360 --> 46:35.080
thinking she'd be back
any second to finish the job.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.400
But that wasn't to be,

46:36.480 --> 46:38.600
because the person at the door
had other plans.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.280
Murder.

46:42.840 --> 46:44.760
PHILIP: So who was it?

46:44.840 --> 46:46.520
Who was it who knocked
at the door?

46:50.040 --> 46:51.320
JACK: It was Pearl.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.600
Sweet, wide-eyed Pearl,

46:58.680 --> 47:03.000
who I assume not only hired a PI
to dig up the dirt on Diane,

47:03.080 --> 47:05.760
but then leaked the story
to a carefully chosen tabloid.

47:08.640 --> 47:09.640
What are you talking about?

47:09.720 --> 47:11.240
Pearl's not capable of...
Selwyn!

47:11.320 --> 47:12.560
Do something about this.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.840
Carry on, Inspector.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.120
What, I suppose you're gonna
tell us next it was Pearl

47:19.200 --> 47:21.200
who pushed her off the balcony?

47:21.280 --> 47:23.040
JACK: Well, close,
but not quite.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.120
She was pushed,
only it wasn't Pearl.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.360
It was you, wasn't it, Stephen?

47:31.440 --> 47:33.560
(CHUCKLES) What? You're insane.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.560
That's ludicrous.
Diane was alone in the room.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.520
The door was locked.
I was there.

47:38.600 --> 47:42.120
Yes, you were, but the point is,
you see, she wasn't.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.920
The killer was never in the room
and neither was the victim.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.440
And you're saying that's me,
that I'm the killer?

47:47.520 --> 47:48.760
Yeah, one of them.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.080
Along with your accomplices.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.680
Well, your two sisters.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.840
I've got 130 witnesses

47:55.920 --> 47:58.640
who will confirm
I was downstairs at the party.

47:58.720 --> 47:59.720
Well, of course you were,

47:59.800 --> 48:01.720
but that was all
part of the plan.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.600
To distract everyone's
attention away

48:03.680 --> 48:04.960
from what was happening
above you.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.640
We're so pleased to welcome

48:07.720 --> 48:09.840
so many dear friends
and family...

48:09.920 --> 48:11.360
Karen, tell him he's wrong.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.480
JACK: Now, look.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.760
I have no idea
what Pearl said to Diane

48:17.840 --> 48:19.840
when she knocked on the door.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.440
She must've spun her a story
about Stephen

48:22.520 --> 48:24.920
needing to see her urgently,
a matter of life or death,

48:25.000 --> 48:26.440
which indeed it was.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.880
Stephen needs to see you, now.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.080
JACK: With Diane
out of the room,

48:34.160 --> 48:37.120
Pearl set about
her part of the plan.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.600
She chained the door
behind her.

48:41.240 --> 48:43.080
And then using Diane's phone,

48:43.160 --> 48:44.920
sent a text message
to her father.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.200
After years of wanting
to be an actress,

48:51.280 --> 48:53.240
Pearl finally found
the perfect role.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.680
PHILIP: Diane?

48:55.760 --> 48:58.360
It wasn't Diane who called out
"I can't! I'm sorry."

48:58.440 --> 49:00.480
It was Pearl,
imitating her voice.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.240
I can't! I'm sorry.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.200
JACK: You took a gamble
that your father in his panic

49:04.280 --> 49:05.520
wouldn't spot the difference.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.440
See, it's all
a matter of perception.

49:10.520 --> 49:13.080
And that's why Philip didn't
catch the killer red-handed

49:13.160 --> 49:15.320
when he smashed his way into
the room only seconds later,

49:15.400 --> 49:18.480
because the only person
in the room at that moment

49:18.560 --> 49:19.600
was you.

49:19.680 --> 49:21.040
You were in the bathroom...

49:21.120 --> 49:22.280
PHILIP: Diane?

49:22.360 --> 49:24.520
...when you heard the commotion,
but not your own.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.440
You were in Diane's bathroom.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.880
Simply hiding until Philip
had gone out onto the balcony.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.000
Daddy?

49:33.200 --> 49:34.360
This doesn't make any sense.

49:34.440 --> 49:36.800
(STAMMERING) If Diane
wasn't even in the room,

49:36.880 --> 49:38.760
then how exactly did she die?

49:38.840 --> 49:41.240
That's a good question,
Mr Marston,

49:42.640 --> 49:44.080
which I'm coming to right now.

49:45.480 --> 49:48.400
As best man, Stephen was tasked

49:48.480 --> 49:49.800
with the allocation
of the rooms.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.600
Now, the room
you shared with Diane

49:51.680 --> 49:54.520
was room 317 on the third floor.

49:54.600 --> 49:57.680
But Stephen's room was 417.

49:57.760 --> 50:00.200
Directly above you
on the fourth floor.

50:00.280 --> 50:03.240
Knowing that Pearl would send
Diane up to see him,

50:03.320 --> 50:05.240
Stephen waited
for her to arrive.

50:05.320 --> 50:06.640
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

50:08.400 --> 50:10.560
And then I imagine
all you had to do was...

50:10.640 --> 50:12.520
provoke her
into some sort of an argument.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.160
Say, about Julie Francois,

50:14.240 --> 50:17.760
and then somehow cajole her
out onto the balcony.

50:17.840 --> 50:20.040
Until you heard the signal
from the room below,

50:20.120 --> 50:21.240
four little words.

50:21.320 --> 50:22.800
PEARL: I can't! I'm sorry.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.000
(GRUNTS)

50:27.080 --> 50:29.920
JACK: And with everyone
watching Karen make her speech,

50:30.000 --> 50:31.680
-no one saw it happen.
-(THUDS)

50:34.320 --> 50:35.800
(PANTING)

50:41.480 --> 50:43.520
It was... It was Pearl's idea.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.760
Karen, tell them it was...

50:44.840 --> 50:46.520
Shut up! Shut up!

50:46.600 --> 50:49.560
JACK: You knew the autopsy
wouldn't be able to tell us

50:49.640 --> 50:52.640
whether Diane fell from
the third floor or the fourth.

50:52.720 --> 50:55.600
As long as you sold the illusion
that Diane was in her room

50:55.680 --> 50:57.280
and that everyone else
only arrived

50:57.360 --> 50:58.760
after your dad had broken in.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.320
Dad, Dad!

51:00.400 --> 51:01.760
Who would believe
that any of you

51:01.840 --> 51:03.640
could've been behind the murder?

51:03.720 --> 51:05.400
Let alone all three of you.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.640
None of you are denying it.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.200
Tell him it's a lie.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.680
Tell him!

51:16.880 --> 51:18.120
Why?

51:20.440 --> 51:21.600
We didn't want her.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.160
(SIGHS)

51:28.240 --> 51:29.720
A friend of mine said recently,

51:29.800 --> 51:32.680
it's not the parents
who cut the apron strings.

51:32.760 --> 51:33.880
She was right.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.800
Comes a moment
where most children,

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
they feel the need

51:40.720 --> 51:42.000
to find their own lives.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.640
None of you three ever did.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.920
Now, why would you?

51:48.000 --> 51:49.920
When you had everything
you ever wanted on tap.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.720
And when you spend your life
in a series of hotels

51:52.800 --> 51:56.080
with your name on it,
the Marston family name,

51:56.160 --> 51:58.000
there's one word
that you never hear

51:58.080 --> 52:00.160
until Diane Smith
came into your lives.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.240
For the first time,
you heard the word "no."

52:05.440 --> 52:08.120
Each of you had a reason
to feel threatened by Diane.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.720
She wasn't going to forget
about a sexual assault charge,

52:10.800 --> 52:12.600
or let you sidestep
getting a job,

52:12.680 --> 52:16.040
or let you pressure her
into signing a prenup.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.960
Diane wasn't gonna be
bought or bullied.

52:19.760 --> 52:22.800
So you reacted the way
all spoilt children do.

52:22.880 --> 52:25.440
Except it wasn't just your toys
you threw out of the pram.

52:26.840 --> 52:27.840
Hmm?

52:28.640 --> 52:29.760
Take them away.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.320
Uh, I'll catch up with you.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.520
-So you arrested them?
-Yes.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.360
Audrey,

53:03.440 --> 53:04.760
whatever he was in the past,

53:04.840 --> 53:07.680
the Dwayne Myers I know now
is a good man.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.880
Wait, okay.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
What's he done so bad
that you can't forgive him?

53:20.040 --> 53:21.040
(GASPS)

53:21.120 --> 53:22.120
While you were dating her,

53:22.200 --> 53:23.560
you also had a fling
with her sister?

53:24.440 --> 53:26.000
Dorothy is Audrey's sister?

53:26.080 --> 53:27.320
And her auntie.

53:27.400 --> 53:30.840
Wait, wait.
Alice is her auntie? Oh, no!

53:30.920 --> 53:33.040
No wonder the woman
never forgave you, Dwayne,

53:33.120 --> 53:35.240
if you are working your way
through her whole family.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.920
Hey, hey, hold on a minute.
That's a bit harsh.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.200
Harsh? You know
how she found out?

53:39.280 --> 53:40.400
How?

53:40.480 --> 53:43.040
Because you gave them all
identical bracelets.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.600
Well, Turtle Beat
had a good deal going on.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.000
Buy one, get two free.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.640
(SCOFFS)

53:49.760 --> 53:50.760
And she didn't say anything

53:50.840 --> 53:52.360
about her cousin Valerie
in Sandy Bay?

53:53.920 --> 53:54.960
You...

53:55.680 --> 53:56.640
What?

54:00.400 --> 54:01.760
Are you gonna be okay?

54:01.840 --> 54:03.280
Oh, I think so, sir.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.320
I should probably scold you,

54:05.400 --> 54:07.760
for endangering yourself
and a suspect.

54:07.840 --> 54:10.160
I should probably apologise
for doubting you.

54:10.240 --> 54:13.160
Oh, well, what do you say
we call it quits?

54:13.240 --> 54:16.080
Excellent work,
Detective Inspector.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.200
Hmm.

54:17.280 --> 54:20.280
I believe you just
raised the bar.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.840
Oh, thank you, sir.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.560
I have to ask.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.880
How did you...

54:27.960 --> 54:31.480
Oh, well, she just painted
one thumbnail, you see.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.320
And she left the lid
off the pot,

54:33.400 --> 54:35.400
which, of course,
makes it gloopy.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.760
(DWAYNE LAUGHING)

54:45.880 --> 54:48.120
Ah, well.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.960
Nice work, Chief.

54:50.680 --> 54:52.280
I never doubted you.

54:52.360 --> 54:53.920
I appreciate that, Dwayne.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.480
Looks like you'll be
buying the beers from now on.

54:56.560 --> 54:59.120
Wait, no.
That's not what we agreed.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.640

55:01.320 --> 55:02.320

55:03.680 --> 55:04.920

55:15.880 --> 55:17.000

55:18.120 --> 55:19.400

Good man, yourself. Come in.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

55:31.960 --> 55:33.400
So we were just passing

55:33.480 --> 55:35.840
and we thought
you might be hungry.

55:35.920 --> 55:38.760
Well, that's very thoughtful
of you. (CHUCKLES)

55:38.840 --> 55:41.040
I'm never gonna be able
to manage all that on my own.

55:41.120 --> 55:43.400
Ah, don't worry about that, sir.

55:43.800 --> 55:44.760
Okay.

I thought as it's your
first night without Siobhan,

55:58.840 --> 56:02.240
I would keep you company
with a bowl of... What else?

56:02.320 --> 56:05.080
-No, it's not.
-(CHUCKLES)

56:05.160 --> 56:08.040
Wow, that's amazing, Catherine.

Okay, drinks all round.

-Ah, one more for Audrey.
-Hey.

-That's not funny.

just dropped dead

in the middle of a game.

With Florence out of action,
I might need you to step up.

-Temporary.
-As detective.

it's a big deal.
