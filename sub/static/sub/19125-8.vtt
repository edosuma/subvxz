Good, because that's what we

02:01.980 --> 02:04.781
In fantasy films, the best teams

02:04.816 --> 02:07.909

unlikely of companions.

So, with that in mind,

02:23.001 --> 02:25.093
your next Spotlight Challenge

02:25.170 --> 02:27.637

be funny too,

04:18.742 --> 04:20.208
Our wood elf character

04:20.285 --> 04:22.335
<i>is gonna be sort of the older,
fun-loving</i>

04:22.412 --> 04:24.379
<i>new-lease-on-life character.</i>

04:24.456 --> 04:26.923
<i>And then she'll also have
a beehive hairdo,</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:28.675
<i>which will be an actual beehive.</i>

04:28.752 --> 04:32.512
<i>And the Minotaur will be

04:32.589 --> 04:35.390
I want the beehive thing
to look realistic,

04:35.467 --> 04:37.267

04:37.278 --> 04:39.060
<i>And we really love comedy.</i>

<i>So we just feel like this is
right up our alley.</i>

04:41.306 --> 04:42.856

04:42.932 --> 04:45.734

fresh Ben and Evan.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.904
I think it sounds great.

04:49.981 --> 04:51.531
Why are they together?

04:51.608 --> 04:53.408
What brought them together?

04:53.485 --> 04:55.118
Maybe their races
are becoming extinct,

04:55.153 --> 04:57.370
so they're negotiating
their territory.

04:57.447 --> 04:58.455
Yeah, that works.

04:58.490 --> 05:01.082
These two characters
meet on a quest.

05:01.159 --> 05:04.794
<i>And our goblin is just
this sneaky cave dweller.</i>

05:04.805 --> 05:08.298
<i>And our faun is this
very gentle, kind character</i>

05:08.333 --> 05:10.133
that is being manipulated
by the goblin

05:10.144 --> 05:11.968
to lead her towards the castle.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.596
So she's, like, the greedy...

05:14.672 --> 05:16.639
And then he's more like...
Eeyore.

05:16.674 --> 05:19.476
Yes. Very Eeyore-ish.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.228
I think the proportions
that look good

05:22.305 --> 05:24.105
are the tapering top
of the head,

05:24.182 --> 05:27.275
big traps, big forehead,
and shrunken face.

05:27.352 --> 05:29.652
I think Adam and I are having
a tough time rebounding

05:29.663 --> 05:31.654

from last challenge.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.157
<i>So it's a rough start,

05:34.168 --> 05:35.669
<i>to have the models there
in the suits</i>

05:35.693 --> 05:36.826
<i>because we can get an idea</i>

05:36.861 --> 05:38.661
of what the end product's
gonna look like.

05:38.696 --> 05:40.830
The orc is kind of
dumb and brutish.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.832
And she can be
full of knowledge,

05:42.843 --> 05:46.294
but not as physically capable,
so they make a good pair.

05:46.371 --> 05:49.005
So our orc is sort of like
a dopey,

05:49.040 --> 05:50.924
<i>construction-worker-trope
character.</i>

05:51.000 --> 05:53.843
<i>And the naiad is aquatic,
so we want to make her</i>

05:53.878 --> 05:56.805
<i>fun-loving, book-smart,
merfolk character.</i>

05:56.881 --> 05:59.349
We don't want to go a
direct fish route with her,

05:59.360 --> 06:01.518
<i>but we do want to incorporate</i>

06:01.528 --> 06:03.937
<i>some water
and fin-like features.</i>

06:04.013 --> 06:06.689
And I thought if they find
a baby dragon egg

06:06.724 --> 06:08.316
and they want to return it...

06:08.393 --> 06:10.026
She stops him
from cooking the egg.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.028
She's a little spitfire,
and he's just...

06:12.039 --> 06:14.322
- Uh-huh?
- Lennie from "Mice and Men."

06:14.399 --> 06:15.615
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

06:15.692 --> 06:17.033
There's gonna be
a stark contrast,

06:17.044 --> 06:18.827
so, yeah, she needs to be fiery.

06:18.903 --> 06:20.370
We have Grizzlemaw, the dwarf,

06:20.405 --> 06:23.289
and she's just this
lonely old lady

06:23.366 --> 06:24.624
<i>that never had any kids.</i>

06:24.701 --> 06:26.960
- "I don't need nobody!"
- Yeah.

06:27.036 --> 06:29.295
<i>But in her old age, she just
wants to see the world.</i>

06:29.372 --> 06:31.881
Maybe, like, she was traveling,
and he was getting picked on

06:31.916 --> 06:34.968
by other ogres, and she saw it,

06:35.044 --> 06:37.679
and she defended him,
and then they...

06:37.755 --> 06:40.306
then he just kind of follows her
around like a lost puppy.

06:40.383 --> 06:41.391
That's fun.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.725
<i>Our dwarf character, Grizzlemaw,</i>

06:42.736 --> 06:45.186
meets Mutton, who's our ogre.

06:45.263 --> 06:48.231
<i>And he's just big and fat
and stupid.</i>

06:48.242 --> 06:49.858
But, like, you can't help
but love him.

06:49.934 --> 06:51.401
I definitely want to incorporate

06:51.412 --> 06:55.080
a heavy, wrinkly,
textured skin on her.

06:57.066 --> 06:58.586
We were thinking, like,
a married couple.

06:58.610 --> 06:59.909
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.255
And I'm thinking that
you're going on a vacation

07:01.279 --> 07:03.079
and you kind of stumble
into an adventure.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.874

are a married couple

07:12.457 --> 07:14.591
<i>So she's the one
that makes the itinerary.</i>

07:14.626 --> 07:17.343
And he's the one that's like,
"I'll get the check."

07:17.420 --> 07:19.596
She was, you know,
a beautiful fairy at one point,

07:19.631 --> 07:21.055
and then she kind of
let herself go.

07:21.132 --> 07:23.224
<i>Keaghlan really wants to work
on the fairy.</i>

07:23.301 --> 07:25.894
She's really into bright colors
and that sort of whimsy thing.

07:25.970 --> 07:27.281
And I'm like,
"That'll work perfect."

07:27.305 --> 07:29.189
<i>I really want to do
ugly and grotesque,</i>

07:29.265 --> 07:30.899
<i>so I'll take the troll.</i>

07:30.975 --> 07:32.286

Tell us how your bodysuits

37:06.207 --> 37:08.216
influenced
your character design.

37:08.251 --> 37:11.552
The orc character, we went
more towards the animated route.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.389
And for the naiad,
she had enhanced breasts

37:14.399 --> 37:15.556

37:15.591 --> 37:18.226

a bustle to me.

37:18.261 --> 37:20.979
Your aquatic character
could have been really gorgeous,

37:28.771 --> 37:32.031
You know, she lives in a pond.

37:32.108 --> 37:35.076
I do think the orc
is pretty fantastic.

37:35.111 --> 37:39.747
The forms on your naiad
feel superfluous and arbitrary.

37:39.782 --> 37:41.916
And the orc...
I would consider having the lips

37:41.927 --> 37:45.420
not be so pink,
but solid character.

37:45.455 --> 37:49.716
It's just they're not of the
same production design world.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.592
The naiad feels
very underdeveloped to me.

37:51.627 --> 37:53.261
I think there's a really cool
idea here,

37:53.272 --> 37:56.764

gotten rid of the goofy glasses

37:56.799 --> 37:58.599

around her eyes.
