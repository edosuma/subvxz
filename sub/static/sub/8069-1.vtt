00:03.871 --> 00:06.240
[theme music playing]

00:46.614 --> 00:49.049
[laughing]

00:49.083 --> 00:51.485
[music playing]

00:57.625 --> 00:59.660
- Is my hair OK like this?
- I guess so.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.963
We're only having hamburgers.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.366
It makes me look
older, don't you think?

01:05.399 --> 01:06.500
Jimmy's a junior.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.668
Who's Jimmy?

01:07.701 --> 01:08.569
You don't know him.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.737
He's in high school.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.838
Oh, excuse me.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.107
Jimmy Meltrigger's
the varsity quarterback.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.342
Ooh.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.344
Well tell him no taking
the snap on the first date.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.445
Dan!

01:17.478 --> 01:19.913
Just trying to get
her ready for game time.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.815
Well, when is game
time, by the way?

01:21.849 --> 01:22.850
Tomorrow night.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.285
He's picking up here.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.186
As opposed to where?

01:25.219 --> 01:26.019
Motel 6?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.061
Why don't you wear
your blue sweater outfit?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.329
You look really good in that.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.464
I might.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.866
But if I do wear it, it
won't be because of you.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.067
I was just trying to help!

01:40.100 --> 01:41.669
Just don't!

01:41.702 --> 01:42.903
Fine!

01:42.936 --> 01:45.339
Go ahead and wear one of
your dorky big butt outfits.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.574
[doorbell ringing]

01:47.775 --> 01:49.443
This is Roseanne at
Magazine Discount House.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.711
Darlene, please get the door.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.613
Why do I always
have to get the door?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.081
You don't always
have to get the door.

01:54.114 --> 01:54.982
[doorbell ringing]

01:55.015 --> 01:57.918
I'll go!

01:57.951 --> 01:58.886
Hi, Crystal.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.821
Hello, hello, hello.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.590
Hey, Crystal, did
you get the dress?

02:02.623 --> 02:03.691
Uh-huh.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.693
I went through my
cousin Beverly's closet,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.161
and I found a treasure.

02:07.195 --> 02:12.400
Tomorrow night, Roseanne, you
will be the belle of the ball!

02:12.433 --> 02:16.370
I'd rather wear the bag.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.138
What's wrong with it?

02:18.172 --> 02:20.040
Well, you stick a
couple candles in my nose,

02:20.073 --> 02:23.477
and I'd look like
a birthday cake.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.147
Thanks, anyway, Crystal.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.617
Dan, you just better go to
this thing all by yourself.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.452
No dice, babe.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.586
You gotta go.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.087
It's a grand opening.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.825
I dry walled this bank for you.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.227
Well, why couldn't
you have dry walled

02:39.260 --> 02:40.994
some dress shop for me?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.296
Come on, you'll
have a great time.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.866
Free champagne, live band,
all the shrimp you can eat.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.236
And yes, me.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.303
What more could you want?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.872
I want a new dress.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.741
Why don't you have any money?

02:53.774 --> 02:57.845
Well I did, but I blew
it on tube socks for DJ.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.881
Damn, I hate myself.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.851
Hey, I know where you can
borrow a really nice dress,

03:03.884 --> 03:05.018
but you gotta be open.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.487
What is that supposed to mean?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.656
By open, I mean
I know someone who

03:08.689 --> 03:10.057
you can borrow a dress from.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.393
But when I mention her name, you
gotta promise you won't scream.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.361
I promise.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.395
Edna DeBelco.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.763
[screaming]

03:15.796 --> 03:16.697
Who's Edna DeBelco?

03:16.730 --> 03:17.998
[screaming]

03:19.099 --> 03:21.201
She's a really
wonderful person, Dan.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.603
Roseanne's just
screaming because she

03:22.636 --> 03:25.906
thinks Edna's a whining,
complaining, sniveling kletch.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.542
Kvetch.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.345
Becky, what do you
think of this dress?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.447
Stick a few candles
in it and make a wish.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.660
Hey Mom, what you working on?

03:46.694 --> 03:47.961
Invoices.

03:47.995 --> 03:48.796
I'm ordering new children.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.966
Yeah?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.868
Well, why don't we trade
Becky in for a partially

03:54.902 --> 03:58.606
tattooed Latin boy of 16?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.474
'Cause that's my
Christmas present to myself.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.445
Hold it.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.080
Could this woman
be my little Becky?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.181
Not all of her.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.483
If I were you,
I'd check upstairs

04:09.517 --> 04:10.484
for some missing Kleenex.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.959
Darlene, you have
such a big mouth.

04:18.992 --> 04:22.262
And you have
such a small chest.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.264
At least I have a chest.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.535
At least I'm not a drooling,
boy crazed nymphomaniac.

04:27.568 --> 04:31.472
Hey, leave me outta this.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.940
You're just jealous
because I have a date.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.808
And a two ply chest.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.677
Hermaphrodite.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.511
Oh yeah?

04:40.381 --> 04:41.782
How does this skirt
look with this sweater?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.285
Good.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.821
Mom?

04:47.855 --> 04:48.722
Just fine.

04:48.756 --> 04:49.857
- Really?
- Really.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.024
- Dad?
- Terrific.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.159
- Promise?
- Promise.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.060
Mom?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.261
Becky, would you relax?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.996
Your date's not
even until tonight.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.198
But I'm giving my report
in front of the whole student

04:58.231 --> 05:00.468
council today, and
Jimmy Meltrigger's

05:00.501 --> 05:03.136
the head of my committee.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.037
Really, Mom?

05:04.071 --> 05:04.938
Really.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.073
- Thanks.
- Becky.

05:06.106 --> 05:06.974
What?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.777
- Come here.
- What?

05:09.810 --> 05:10.811
You forgot your report.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.115
I gotta go.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.818
I gotta go to the lumberyard
and talk to Joey L.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.187
Hey, when you go over
there to pick up your tuxedo,

05:20.220 --> 05:21.889
make sure you get the
shoes that go with it.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.023
I will.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.258
Ah, you better put a
note on your windshield.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.694
Hey, don't worry about me.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.261
What are you gonna wear?

05:28.295 --> 05:31.965
Well, in the immortal words of
Dan Conner on his wedding day,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.334
babe, I'm gonna wear
what I'm gonna wear.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.168
[spitting]

05:37.104 --> 05:39.407
And whatever it
is, I'm sure you'll

05:39.440 --> 05:41.008
look as terrific as I did.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.036
Hi, Edna.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.138
It's Roseanne Conner.
How are you?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.030
Good evening.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.000
This is Vanessa from the
Magazine Discount House.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.303
And since you're a preferred
customer with a credit card,

06:43.336 --> 06:46.339
I'm prepared to offer you a one,
two, or three year subscription

06:46.373 --> 06:47.975
to your favorite
magazines at prices

06:48.008 --> 06:51.111
substantially lower than that
which you pay at the newsstand.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.214
Yeah, same to you.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.616
[phone ringing]

06:57.685 --> 06:59.119
Hello?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.420
Oh, hi, Edna.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.254
[screaming]

07:03.724 --> 07:04.692
Oh, yeah.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.494
I tried it on and
it fits perfectly.

07:09.329 --> 07:13.834
No, I wouldn't try to
lance that thing by myself.

07:13.867 --> 07:14.735
Ow!

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
Oh, Dan hurt himself, Edna.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.771
I have to go.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.578
Hey, I thought you
had pep squad today.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.379
I'm quitting pep squad,
I'm quitting school,

07:26.413 --> 07:27.481
I'm never going back again!

07:27.515 --> 07:30.984
And if anybody calls
me, tell them I'm dead!

07:31.018 --> 07:32.152
Well, it must be serious.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.353
She's not taking phone calls.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.254
[door slamming]

07:34.287 --> 07:35.155
Where is she?

07:35.188 --> 07:36.724
Where is my sister?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.526
- She went upstairs.
- Aha!

07:38.559 --> 07:39.860
I'll nail her on her home turf.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.029
Nah, you're not
nailing nobody.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.096
What happened?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.431
I've been waiting
for something like this

07:44.464 --> 07:47.067
since I was two.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.703
You passed a test.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.604
Enlighten us.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.440
I'd be glad to.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.209
This is according to Cheryl
Brewer, whose older sister not

07:56.243 --> 08:00.447
only goes to Lanford High, but
is also on the student council

08:00.480 --> 08:03.817
and had a ringside seat for
the event of the century.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.253
Get to the point, Edna.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.155
OK, this is great.
OK, here goes.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.823
OK, here goes.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.491
Hot shot Becky is
standing up to give

08:11.525 --> 08:15.128
her speech in front of all her
snotty high school friends--

08:15.162 --> 08:22.836
Georgina Wellen, Linda Ferramin,
Diana Schnozz Birelli, and Mr.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.773
Perfect, Jimmy Meltrigger.

08:25.806 --> 08:30.310
There she is, all dressed
up, trying to look so cool,

08:30.343 --> 08:31.879
with her hair perfect
that she spent

08:31.912 --> 08:34.247
45 minutes on in the bathroom.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.650
Darlene.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.985
OK.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.855
Well, just as she
completes the line,

08:41.889 --> 08:45.192
"I'd like to thank the student
council for allowing me

08:45.225 --> 08:47.561
to speak my mind," it happened.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.162
What happened?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.164
Becky cut the cheese.

08:57.337 --> 09:01.575
People are already calling
her Conner the Bomber.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.143
Darlene, give it a rest.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.245
Wow, poor Becky.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.147
She should be proud.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.250
Becky Conner, the only woman
to break the sound barrier

09:10.283 --> 09:13.353
without a plane.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.488
You know this is
gonna happen to you.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.125
I think I'm gonna go upstairs
and see how her day went.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.895
Oh no, I think you're just
gonna go on in the kitchen

09:21.929 --> 09:23.597
and fix yourself a snack.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.832
I'm not hungry.

09:24.865 --> 09:28.401
Well then, go out there
and stay there till you are.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.336
Well, now what?

09:35.976 --> 09:36.844
Shut up, Dan!

09:36.877 --> 09:38.211
What?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.046
This isn't funny.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.420
This is totally serious.

09:47.454 --> 09:51.825
Well, why don't you go up--
upstairs and talk to her.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.427
Because I figure this
is your area of expertise.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.435
OK, OK.

10:02.469 --> 10:15.883
[clearing throat]

10:15.916 --> 10:19.619
I didn't make it!

10:19.653 --> 10:20.587
Honey?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.488
What?

10:21.521 --> 10:24.191
I owe you one.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.092
[knocking]

10:30.063 --> 10:31.631
I heard you laid down the law.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.938
Who told you?

10:37.971 --> 10:38.839
It was on the news.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.845
Darlene told me.
- Great.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.680
Hey, honey, accidents happen.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.815
Well, this one
happened in front

10:47.848 --> 10:49.582
of the whole student council.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.483
Everybody heard it.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.185
Jimmy Meltrigger heard it.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.087
Well, gee, I don't
know what to tell you.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.223
I don't want this, OK?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.791
Well, what about
your date with Jimmy?

10:57.825 --> 10:58.625
What do you think?

11:04.464 --> 11:07.267
You know, when I was in high
school, I kept this diary.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.869
I've heard the diary story.

11:08.902 --> 11:13.006
Yeah, well, I
made some revisions.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.809
OK, and in this diary, I had
written down my innermost

11:15.843 --> 11:19.847
secrets, all my
fantasies, love poems, all

11:19.880 --> 11:21.749
that really embarrassing crap.
- I know.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.816
And some guy stole it.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.886
Yeah, and read it
to the whole school.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.421
I wanted to crawl
into a hole and die.

11:28.455 --> 11:32.059
That was the worst thing
I've ever lived through.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.461
But you know, to
this day, I don't

11:34.494 --> 11:35.996
even remember that guy's name.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.466
Barry Watnick.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.935
His name was Barry Watnick.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.337
Every time you tell that story,
you say, I can remember it

11:44.371 --> 11:45.338
like it was yesterday.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.575
That creep Barry
Watnick stole my diary!

11:48.608 --> 11:49.542
Nice try!

11:49.576 --> 11:50.443
[slamming]

11:53.947 --> 11:56.683
Lonnie told me about
Becky's unfortunate accident.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.517
I'm so sorry.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.255
Yeah, we're thinking of
having her put to sleep.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.061
I bought Becky a card.

12:13.366 --> 12:17.104
Well, how thoughtful
and strange.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.472
Well, I gotta drop
Lonnie off at the Y.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.074
Then I'll be back
to do your makeup.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.075
Thank you, Crystal.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.280
You know, they say they
make a card for everything.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.115
What do you wanna bet?

12:35.022 --> 12:36.356
I'll be damned.

12:40.994 --> 12:41.995
Hi, sweetheart.

12:53.073 --> 12:53.874
Here's the remote.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.828
[whistling]

13:28.909 --> 13:29.809
[sighing]

13:52.866 --> 13:54.267
[blowing raspberry]

14:02.342 --> 14:05.178
Roseanne, why don't
you let me talk to Becky?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.747
No, she's already
close enough to the edge.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.950
You know what I'm
gonna do, Roseanne?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.151
I'm gonna leave
you some samples.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.386
[laughing]

14:13.420 --> 14:15.288
What's so funny?

14:15.322 --> 14:18.959
Oh, I was just remembering the
time when you dove into the Ivy

14:18.992 --> 14:22.229
Street pool and came up,
and had a whole conversation

14:22.262 --> 14:28.635
with Henry Jywicki with your
left buoy bobbing on the surf.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.038
[laughing]

14:33.106 --> 14:34.975
That never happened!

14:35.008 --> 14:36.276
You don't remember that?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.378
Henry Jywicki spent the
rest of the summer riding

14:38.411 --> 14:40.380
his bike around our driveway.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.315
That never happened, Jackie.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.850
If that would have
happened, I would have been

14:43.883 --> 14:46.753
more popular in high school.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.221
It was 4th of July weekend.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.323
You had on that stars
and stripes bathing

14:50.357 --> 14:52.125
suit because you said
it reminded you of Peter

14:52.159 --> 14:53.927
Fonda's helmet in Easy Rider.

14:53.961 --> 14:58.265
And when you came up, half
the country had disappeared.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.567
Oh my god.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.236
I had completely
forgotten about that!

15:03.270 --> 15:04.071
Come on.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.008
[knocking]

15:10.543 --> 15:12.279
Go ahead, tell her.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.047
Becky, I heard
about what happened

15:14.081 --> 15:15.148
to you at school today.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.483
Great.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.385
I just wanted to tell you
that it reminded me of the time

15:18.418 --> 15:20.853
when your mom dove
into a public pool

15:20.887 --> 15:25.425
and came up with half
of her bathing suit off.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.594
Which half?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.829
The northern states.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.399
I was so crushed, I didn't
even go back to that pool

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
for the rest of the summer.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.969
What's your point?

15:36.003 --> 15:38.271
Well, the point is that
when it happened to me,

15:38.305 --> 15:40.340
I was so humiliated, I
thought I'd never get over it,

15:40.373 --> 15:41.674
you know?

15:41.708 --> 15:45.745
But until just now, I had
completely forgotten about it.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.247
And you remembered it?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.816
Oh yeah, like
it was yesterday.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.052
That was the talk of the town.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.054
I ran into Henry Jywicki
just the other day

15:54.087 --> 15:55.122
at the hardware store.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.356
He asked me if you
were gonna be joining

15:56.389 --> 15:58.025
the pool again this summer.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.026
Then he made that face.

16:01.894 --> 16:02.762
[slamming]

16:08.701 --> 16:10.603
Here she is!

16:10.637 --> 16:14.507
Miss America!

16:14.541 --> 16:19.012
Miss Conner Hales
from Lanford, Illinois.

16:19.046 --> 16:22.115
Her goal is to achieve
peace on earth.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.784
And her hobbies
include windsurfing

16:24.817 --> 16:29.489
and satisfying her man.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.957
You look great, Mom!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.059
Well, thank you.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.393
Come on, Deej, let's
go get your PJ's on.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.894
[doorbell ringing]

16:34.927 --> 16:37.597
I'll get it if I can
come out of the kitchen.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.699
Come out of that kitchen,
you're gonna get it.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.334
Ooh, notice me tremble.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.474
Hi.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.842
Uh, I'm here to pick up Becky.

16:49.876 --> 16:50.743
Oh, hi.

16:50.777 --> 16:51.978
You must be Jimmy.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.945
Come on in.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.381
Thanks.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.015
Nice house.

16:56.049 --> 16:59.186
Guess you don't get out much.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.553
Well, Becky's still upstairs.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.189
Can I get you
something to drink?

17:02.222 --> 17:03.290
No, thanks, really, I'm fine.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.629
You must be Darlene.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.231
Why?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.299
Your sister was right.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.867
You're pretty cute.

17:14.901 --> 17:15.902
Becky said that?

17:18.905 --> 17:19.972
JIMMY: Yeah.

17:20.006 --> 17:23.110
You sure you don't
want something to drink?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.878
Uh, no, I'm all right.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.748
Well, if you do want
anything, I'll be in the kitchen

17:28.781 --> 17:31.284
for the rest of my life.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.685
I'll go tell
Becky you're here.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.686
Have a seat.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.054
Miss Moneypenny,
I've spoken to Q.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.559
We've deposited the microfilm
in a vault in Zurich.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.460
Move.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.294
Right.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.670
[sighing]

17:50.703 --> 17:53.973
So uh, Becky tells me
you're a quarterback.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.642
Uh, no.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.178
I'm a cornerback.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.612
Oh.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.547
[sighing]

18:00.580 --> 18:01.948
Feel much safer
knowing my daughter

18:01.981 --> 18:04.083
is going out with
a defensive player.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.952
[chuckling]

18:06.986 --> 18:08.555
You know, I uh,
I see your picture

18:08.588 --> 18:09.722
in the trophy case at school.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.699
The Illinois Regionals.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.434
They say you were one
of the best linemen

18:21.468 --> 18:22.969
ever to play for Lanford.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.904
Jimmy, are you saying all
this to get on my good side.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.674
- Yes, I am.
- It's working.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.077
So, Jimbo, tell me a little
bit more about yourself.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.480
Like for example,
why you idolize me?

18:37.517 --> 18:38.518
[knocking]

18:39.852 --> 18:42.355
Hey, Jimmy Meltrigger's
downstairs waiting for you.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.291
- Oh my god.
- That's what I said.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.325
Ooh, he ain't bad.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.462
I can't believe it.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.397
He's here?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.365
Oh my god, what
is he doing here?

18:52.399 --> 18:54.334
Well, right now he's
charming the rented

18:54.367 --> 18:57.837
pants off of your father.

18:57.870 --> 18:58.738
Look, I can't see him.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.006
Tell him I'm sick.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.842
Oh, Becky get off it already.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.545
It wasn't such a terrible
thing that happened.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.913
And the proof of
it is that Jimmy's

19:06.946 --> 19:08.415
downstairs waiting for you.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.883
He's just keeping
the date to be nice

19:10.917 --> 19:14.787
Oh, and what a rotten
character trait that is.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.056
Mom, I'm gonna run
into everyone I know.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.325
Becky, what are you afraid of?

19:18.358 --> 19:21.461
They were laughing
at me, Mom, come on!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.330
Look.

19:23.363 --> 19:28.368
So you made a little boobie
in front of everybody.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.403
You're just upset because
you don't like to do anything

19:30.437 --> 19:34.307
unless you got it written
down on a pad beforehand.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.076
Hey, what happened was just
one of those spontaneous little

19:37.109 --> 19:39.078
surprises that life is full of.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.115
And fortunately,
no one was hurt.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.457
You better get used to it,
too, because I'm telling you,

19:50.490 --> 19:54.193
life is full of boobies.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.695
Now, why don't you get
downstairs before Aunt

19:55.728 --> 19:59.366
Jackie runs off with your date.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.600
Mom?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.168
You're not gonna
do it again, are you?

20:06.673 --> 20:08.375
No.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.777
I just wanted to tell
you, you look real nice.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.746
Yeah, I do, don't I?

20:13.780 --> 20:14.814
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.050
E-Edna, have you tried
taking a hot bath?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.453
I'll go on record right now
and say that high top cleats

20:20.487 --> 20:22.289
will definitely be back in.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.189
Hey, look it.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.424
They bonded.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.193
Isn't that cute?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.895
Hey, Becky, how you doing?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.398
Hi, Jimmy.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.665
Come on, Dan,
we're gonna be late.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.534
Oh yeah, I'll get the chariot.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.337
Uh, you don't have
her home by midnight,

20:37.370 --> 20:38.170
I'll clothes line you.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.242
Hey, see you at 10:30, sis.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.379
Darlene, you be good.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.747
Will you tell Crystal thanks?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.215
Don't worry, she'll
still be talking

20:49.248 --> 20:52.251
to Edna when you get back.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.887
Hey, have fun, you guys.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.155
[car horn honking]

20:56.188 --> 20:57.457
Oh, that must be my limo.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.665
I wasn't sure you'd show up.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.835
I wasn't sure you'd
be up for going out.

21:08.868 --> 21:12.372
Well, I am.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.841
So am I.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.944
So listen,
everything else aside,

21:17.977 --> 21:18.878
what'd you think of my speech?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.521
[theme music playing]
