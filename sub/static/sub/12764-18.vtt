00:00.935 --> 00:02.630
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.671 --> 00:05.163
You have no idea
how disappointed I am right now.

00:05.241 --> 00:07.766
Don't you care I'm not
happy at the conservatory?

00:07.810 --> 00:09.836
Thank you for letting me know
Amanda was here.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.780
- Glad I could help.
- My mom and I talked.

00:11.815 --> 00:13.578
She won't let me see you
outside of school.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.210
I need to get a job to learn
to be mature and responsible.

00:16.254 --> 00:19.189
I am lazy. My work ethic does suck,
and I don't care about school.

00:19.223 --> 00:22.557
Don't expect me to ride shotgun
on your "woe is me" interstate.

00:22.594 --> 00:24.619
You're smart, and you know it.

00:24.663 --> 00:27.497
Get off your ass and start
making something of yourself.

00:27.534 --> 00:30.697
I know that box is important. Don't
think Kyle'd want you to handle it.

00:30.737 --> 00:33.901
Do you know why it's important to him?
Because I do.

00:33.941 --> 00:36.808
You have no idea about what
Kyle and I share with each other.

00:36.844 --> 00:38.938
I know you don't know him
as well as you think.

00:39.014 --> 00:42.609
The way you crossed boundaries, mixing
your personal and professional life,

00:42.651 --> 00:46.053
- shows an alarming lack of judgment.
- I have big plans for you, Jessi,

00:46.089 --> 00:49.651
and I need you to be as strong and
as smart as you can possibly be.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.455
I need to focus on my family now.

00:51.495 --> 00:54.555
Brian said you'd be like this.
He said I couldn't count on you.

00:54.631 --> 00:56.930
- Why would he say that?
- You keep sending me away.

00:56.968 --> 00:58.731
I'm comfortable with where we are.

00:58.803 --> 01:00.669
- Which is?
- Friends.

01:00.706 --> 01:02.606
- Friends.
- Without benefits.

01:02.641 --> 01:03.801
Brutal.

01:03.843 --> 01:07.405
If there's ever anything you want
to tell me, I hope you know you can.

01:07.447 --> 01:09.278
I do know that.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

01:21.230 --> 01:24.257
It's time we take your training
wheels off. You ready?

01:24.300 --> 01:26.461
I wanna go over the
milk to espresso ratio...

01:26.536 --> 01:30.337
Forget the cheat sheet. Just shadow me.
You'll get the hang of it.

01:30.374 --> 01:31.966
How's the rookie?

01:32.009 --> 01:34.068
- OK, I guess.
- You'll be fine.

01:34.111 --> 01:36.273
I mean, if Josh can do it...

01:36.348 --> 01:38.043
- Nice.
- Sundays are slow.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.144
It's a good day to,
you know, ease into it.

01:41.220 --> 01:44.018
OK, this cash register
can get a little complicated.

01:44.090 --> 01:47.424
You could put a rover
on Mars with this thing.

01:47.494 --> 01:51.055
Anyways, we start with 200 bucks
in the till to make change.

01:51.098 --> 01:52.999
We take the drawer
out of the safe in the mornings.

01:53.034 --> 01:55.127
At the end of the day,
we add up all the sales

01:55.170 --> 01:57.696
and put it back in the safe
for the next day.

01:57.773 --> 02:01.231
- Got it.
- And here you go.

02:04.581 --> 02:05.741
Am I too late?

02:07.050 --> 02:09.110
- For?
- I want to be your first.

02:10.388 --> 02:13.824
Being somebody's first can mean
something completely different.

02:16.628 --> 02:20.998
- I want to be your first customer.
- I knew what you meant.

02:24.504 --> 02:27.269
- Is this what you need?
- Oh... Thanks.

02:31.546 --> 02:33.377
Now, what can I get for you, sir?

02:33.448 --> 02:36.246
I'll have a pineapple-orange-
banana smoothie.

02:39.589 --> 02:42.718
Oop. Oh, whoops.

02:44.394 --> 02:46.055
I must have hit the wrong button.

02:47.197 --> 02:50.167
- No, I don't want kiwi!
- Kiwi sounds good.

02:50.235 --> 02:52.795
- Really?
- I love kiwi.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.137
- OK. How do I take the strawberry off?
- I want strawberry, too.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.442
If you keep changing
your order to cover for me,

03:00.480 --> 03:04.109
- I'll never learn how to do this right.
- Kiwi-strawberry. That's my order.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.176
- Promise?
- Promise.

03:06.220 --> 03:09.189
- Except there's lime on here.
- Lime makes all the difference.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.988
- Promise?
- Promise.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.995
Is this, like, some lame ritual
you guys have?

03:15.030 --> 03:16.965
Because I promise I'm about to puke.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.528
- Keep it professional.
- I am. I'm working. Kyle's a customer.

03:25.976 --> 03:30.778
Listen, I got to take off
for a few hours, so you're in charge.

03:30.815 --> 03:34.946
I am? I mean, are you sure?
It's just me and Amanda, and she's new.

03:34.987 --> 03:38.582
Yeah. Relax.
Nothing ever happens on Sunday.

03:42.896 --> 03:45.991
Whoa!

03:51.774 --> 03:54.174
Aah!

03:58.682 --> 04:00.377
Nothing ever happens on Sunday.

04:12.999 --> 04:16.127
I don't want you to see Kyle anymore.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.637
- Why?
- I'm just not convinced

04:18.672 --> 04:21.435
that he has your best interests in mind.

04:21.507 --> 04:24.967
But he's the only one that understands
what it's like to be me.

04:25.046 --> 04:29.380
But he doesn't believe in you.
Not the way that I do.

04:29.451 --> 04:33.081
And the others, Latnok, they...

04:33.122 --> 04:36.115
They just don't think
you're as good as Kyle.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.060
But they're wrong, OK?
You can be better.

04:39.096 --> 04:42.123
See, they don't see your potential,
and neither does Kyle.

04:43.134 --> 04:47.037
Or he won't.
If he acknowledges how special you are,

04:47.106 --> 04:51.202
then, somehow,
it makes him less special.

04:51.276 --> 04:56.374
- He's always helped me.
- Has he always helped you?

04:56.416 --> 04:58.510
It seems that he's pushing you away.

05:00.321 --> 05:04.782
I am the only person who will
always be there for you.

05:04.860 --> 05:06.191
Whenever you need me.

05:07.929 --> 05:09.362
Just you and me.

05:24.382 --> 05:27.011
You should probably take
the seed out of the avocado

05:27.053 --> 05:29.180
before you put it
in the smoothie machine.

05:29.288 --> 05:33.020
Should've known. I thought
they were just really big limes.

05:34.428 --> 05:36.589
OK, so I'm not that great with fruit.

05:36.630 --> 05:40.226
At least you know an avocado is a fruit.
Most people think it's a vegetable.

05:40.268 --> 05:44.262
- Tell that to the smoothie machine.
- We got customers. Look alive, OK?

05:44.306 --> 05:49.370
I'm on it. I can't help it if
all I want to do is be alone with you.

05:54.751 --> 05:56.583
You really do sound like the manager.

05:56.620 --> 05:59.714
Think I should make the other employees
call me "the Man?"

06:00.725 --> 06:03.353
Anyway, I've got my eye
on a big, fat raise.

06:03.395 --> 06:06.023
So if I have to
crack the whip a little...

06:06.064 --> 06:10.365
- Glad I'm not one of your employees.
- Then technically, you're loitering.

06:19.047 --> 06:22.505
Jessi. Hi. You here for Kyle?

06:24.086 --> 06:27.351
Do you think, maybe, we could talk?

06:27.423 --> 06:31.053
- You know, like we used to?
- Jessi, I don't...

06:31.094 --> 06:33.995
I mean, I'm not your therapist anymore.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.022
Can't we just talk as friends?

06:37.135 --> 06:40.833
- I'm not sure that's appropriate.
- Why?

06:40.873 --> 06:45.401
Well, there are
ethical boundaries, and it's just...

06:46.412 --> 06:48.437
...better if we maintain them.

06:52.019 --> 06:55.147
I think Kyle's at The Rack
if you need to talk to him.

06:58.426 --> 06:59.552
OK.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.024
Goodbye.

07:05.902 --> 07:07.233
Bye.

07:18.283 --> 07:21.617
What's a girl got to do
to get some service around here?

07:21.654 --> 07:25.249
- Well, you can start with the manager.
- What happened to J.T?

07:25.324 --> 07:28.351
- He put me in charge for a few hours.
- Brave man.

07:30.564 --> 07:32.294
Aren't you forgetting something?

07:33.634 --> 07:34.931
Oh, sorry.

07:36.504 --> 07:38.564
Um, sweet, but no.

07:39.975 --> 07:42.672
<i>Money? Cow Keys tickets?</i>

07:43.012 --> 07:45.810
- On sale today?
- Oh, right.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.645
Fork it over. Mama needs some green.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.346
Are you sure you're up to this?

07:49.453 --> 07:51.353
I thought you'd be too chemo'ed out
to wait in line for tickets.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.686
Please. My last chemo was,
like, two days ago.

07:53.724 --> 07:57.661
Puking is, like,
so yesterday... and last night.

07:57.696 --> 08:00.894
I can't believe I'm paying 120 bucks
for concert tickets.

08:00.967 --> 08:03.197
- Am I not worth it?
- You are, but the band?

08:03.302 --> 08:04.701
Fine. We won't go.

08:04.770 --> 08:07.433
But then these are off-limits.

08:07.507 --> 08:09.907
You're giving me an ultimatum?

08:09.943 --> 08:12.777
Sometimes it's the only thing
guys will respond to.

08:12.814 --> 08:15.305
So either I pay for
overpriced concert tickets...

08:15.350 --> 08:19.117
Or the only rack you'll be seeing is
the one that makes you wear that apron.

08:20.122 --> 08:22.921
Fine. Yielding to the power of the boob.

08:22.959 --> 08:25.985
And you just lived
to feel me up another day.

08:31.502 --> 08:36.167
Don't tell me Josh
roped you into minimum wage hell.

08:36.207 --> 08:37.835
Actually, I'm not getting paid.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.803
Looks like the job does have its perks.

08:43.515 --> 08:47.419
She said all she wants to do
is be alone with me.

08:47.454 --> 08:50.252
Looks like you guys
are about to take the next step.

08:50.324 --> 08:52.452
What's the next step?

08:52.494 --> 08:55.827
I think things are about to get
a little bit more hands-on.

08:58.467 --> 09:02.666
As in hands on butts, hands on boobs.

09:04.641 --> 09:07.577
Don't you want to move beyond
the hugs and no-tongue kisses?

09:09.180 --> 09:12.047
Well, I know that
when I'm with her, I...

09:14.820 --> 09:17.414
You get like you did
that day at the pool.

09:17.489 --> 09:21.984
- I can't help it.
- Kyle, that's a good thing.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.155
It's totally natural.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.099
I'm just not sure Amanda's
ready to take the next step.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.662
Kyle? Could you help me
in the storage room for a minute?

09:30.706 --> 09:32.003
Sure.

09:34.609 --> 09:35.667
You were saying?

09:37.547 --> 09:40.175
Go. Go.

09:42.386 --> 09:43.410
Yes.

09:48.860 --> 09:52.023
- How can I help?
- The protein powder. Top shelf.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.361
I can't reach it.

09:56.168 --> 09:57.863
Thanks.

10:01.575 --> 10:02.837
Is that it?

10:03.810 --> 10:04.903
For now.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.943
Were you expecting something else?

10:09.751 --> 10:11.811
Lori thought you asked me in here to...

10:13.689 --> 10:18.150
Oh. No. But I kind of wish
I'd thought of that.

10:19.462 --> 10:21.488
That's OK. I'm glad I could help.

10:21.565 --> 10:22.862
Kyle...

10:24.368 --> 10:25.892
Thank you.

10:36.382 --> 10:39.216
You know, this storage room
is our only chance of privacy,

10:39.253 --> 10:41.346
at least until my mom cools down.

10:41.422 --> 10:44.824
- When will that be?
- It's hard to tell.

10:44.893 --> 10:47.259
I think she just needs
to get to know you better.

10:48.763 --> 10:49.924
I do, too.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.899
But you already know me.

10:52.935 --> 10:55.302
Yeah, but...

10:55.372 --> 10:58.637
...now that we're together,

10:58.675 --> 11:01.372
I feel like there's so much
I still don't know about you.

11:03.581 --> 11:05.378
And I want to know everything.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.635
Small cappuccino, decaf... Whatever.

11:31.848 --> 11:34.408
Where have you been?
It's a madhouse.

11:34.450 --> 11:37.352
- Sorry.
- Just go wipe the tables.

11:43.461 --> 11:46.829
- I thought Sunday was a slow day.
- Yeah, somebody forgot to tell them.

11:46.866 --> 11:48.163
Can I help?

11:51.203 --> 11:52.501
Raise your right hand.

11:55.275 --> 11:57.972
Do you solemnly swear to
uphold the principles of The Rack

11:58.045 --> 12:01.606
<i>and not do anything that'll get me fired
and or sued for labor law violations,</i>

12:01.682 --> 12:03.150
so help you, Josh?

12:03.185 --> 12:05.176
- What?
- I'm deputizing you.

12:05.254 --> 12:06.812
- Just say yes.
- Yes.

12:06.889 --> 12:08.949
OK, Amanda's still new at the register,

12:09.025 --> 12:11.391
so keep an eye on her.
And fix the blender ASAP.

12:11.427 --> 12:12.724
Can you multi-task?

12:13.730 --> 12:17.667
Right. Stupid question.
Any questions that aren't stupid?

12:17.701 --> 12:18.929
Do I get a badge?

12:21.239 --> 12:22.365
You get an apron.

12:25.610 --> 12:28.102
I don't think the smoothie machine
is that damaged.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.238
Speaking of damaged...

12:35.355 --> 12:37.756
- Hi, Jessi.
- Hi.

12:38.693 --> 12:40.024
Do you work here now?

12:40.094 --> 12:42.392
Special circumstances.
I'm just helping out.

12:44.567 --> 12:48.162
- I could give you a hand.
- That's OK. I think I can manage.

12:51.641 --> 12:55.601
Um, the ground wire's
not supposed to run back to the motor.

12:57.648 --> 12:59.844
You're right.

13:02.020 --> 13:05.980
- Does it bother you that I am?
- No, I'm glad you pointed it out.

13:07.994 --> 13:10.326
Well, I was wondering if,
maybe, we could talk.

13:10.363 --> 13:13.026
- Um, But if this a bad time, I could...
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.762
Just hang out for a couple minutes.

13:14.802 --> 13:17.271
I'll get you some coffee,
and then we can talk.

13:17.305 --> 13:21.469
- Promise?
- Yeah.

13:28.385 --> 13:30.979
Easy, there, Lady Macbeth.

13:31.054 --> 13:34.718
You've been scrubbing that same spot
for quite some time now.

13:34.792 --> 13:37.158
I hate to be the jealous girl,
but I just...

13:37.195 --> 13:39.356
I don't like seeing them together.

13:39.431 --> 13:42.423
You've got that "My boyfriend's
with another woman" expression.

13:42.468 --> 13:44.629
What does that look like?

13:47.474 --> 13:50.034
Probably a lot like mine right now.

13:54.949 --> 13:56.713
Except he's not your boyfriend.

14:00.188 --> 14:04.353
You're absolutely right.
He's a free agent. We both are.

14:06.396 --> 14:09.025
There is no reason at all
why it should bother me.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.792
But it does.

14:12.169 --> 14:13.329
Nope.

14:16.808 --> 14:18.105
I'll prove it.

14:29.856 --> 14:32.417
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:34.095 --> 14:35.960
- I'm Lori.
- Kenzie.

14:35.997 --> 14:38.728
And I'm a little confused.

14:38.767 --> 14:43.330
What? I'm just
stopping by to see my friend.

14:44.674 --> 14:45.834
Your friend?

14:46.876 --> 14:51.541
- Aren't we? Friends?
- I'll see you later.

14:51.649 --> 14:54.847
- No, no, no. You don't have to go.
- I think I do. Bye.

14:58.323 --> 15:00.792
- Thank you for that.
- I was trying to be friendly.

15:00.860 --> 15:03.920
- Yeah, well, don't try so hard.
- Excuse me?

15:03.996 --> 15:07.626
Friends want other friends to be happy.
You want me miserable and pining.

15:08.268 --> 15:11.397
- That is so unfair.
- My point exactly.

15:19.215 --> 15:23.152
- That did not just happen.
- I'm sorry.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.848
You should be.

15:25.889 --> 15:29.417
Holding the door would get you, what,
kicked out of the ass-hat society?

15:29.460 --> 15:32.692
Maybe you can put in a good word for me
at the psycho bitch league.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.399
Tell you what, let's settle this
out of court. Let me buy you a coffee.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.607
Yeah, forget it.
Like you're ever gonna get that.

15:43.643 --> 15:47.045
- Should be free by now.
- I asked for no whipped cream.

15:48.783 --> 15:50.081
Let's go somewhere else.

15:58.861 --> 16:00.089
Sorry.

16:01.131 --> 16:03.224
Should be free by now.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.694
I didn't want milk in this.

16:06.771 --> 16:10.070
- Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you did.
- Obviously, but I didn't.

16:10.141 --> 16:12.940
- My mistake.
- Actually, sir, you did order milk.

16:13.012 --> 16:16.106
Honey, hang on. What did you say?

16:16.148 --> 16:19.243
You ordered a half-caf
double espresso with skim milk.

16:19.286 --> 16:22.346
Then you asked somebody on the phone,
"Do you want anything?"

16:22.389 --> 16:25.587
I'm assuming they said no,
because you only ordered the one drink.

16:25.626 --> 16:27.958
We'll fix your order right away.
Not a problem.

16:30.332 --> 16:33.096
- Just give him what he wants.
- But he's wrong.

16:33.135 --> 16:36.936
The customer is always right.
It's an expression.

16:37.941 --> 16:39.374
I don't get it.

16:39.409 --> 16:42.743
It doesn't matter if he's wrong,
you have to let him think he's right,

16:42.780 --> 16:44.805
or he'll take
his business somewhere else.

16:44.882 --> 16:48.580
It's my first day and I can't afford
to lose customers, so trust me on this.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.451
Customer is right
even when they're wrong.

16:50.488 --> 16:52.821
- Yes.
- Every customer?

16:53.893 --> 16:55.121
Everyone.

16:58.765 --> 17:01.757
- ...we have a choice.
- I've been here before.

17:01.802 --> 17:04.567
- ...there's no other place.
- ...ten minutes ago.

17:18.154 --> 17:21.590
Crap. I lost count again.

17:21.659 --> 17:22.921
Here.

17:29.101 --> 17:30.329
$397.

17:30.369 --> 17:32.463
You did not seriously just count that.

17:32.505 --> 17:34.336
Do you need serial numbers, too?

17:34.374 --> 17:36.706
Since when did the smart guy
become a smart-ass?

17:37.811 --> 17:39.836
Wait, how much did you say
was in there?

17:39.914 --> 17:41.677
$397.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.249
That's not right.

17:44.352 --> 17:46.513
There's supposed to be
570 bucks and change in here.

17:47.589 --> 17:49.717
- So...
- We're short 120 bucks.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.761
Josh, I was really careful
with the register.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.098
Yeah, when you were at the register.

17:59.136 --> 18:01.230
You took off with Kyle
in the storage room.

18:01.306 --> 18:03.467
Anybody could have had
their hand in the till.

18:03.508 --> 18:05.670
It could've happened
anytime during the day.

18:05.711 --> 18:08.339
Including the time
you guys were busy making out.

18:09.815 --> 18:11.909
I hope your little rendezvous
was worth it.

18:28.905 --> 18:31.465
- Same count.
- Great.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.270
We were only gone for a minute.

18:33.309 --> 18:35.835
Two minutes and 49 seconds, actually.

18:40.652 --> 18:43.120
Maybe there's another explanation.

18:43.154 --> 18:46.181
OK, full disclosure.
120 bucks is the exact amount

18:46.225 --> 18:48.125
<i>I gave to Andy for the Cow Keys tickets.</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:50.458
I've been saving
for weeks to get those tickets.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.260
No one thinks you stole the money.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.732
Good. So let's get back
to blaming you and Amanda.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.793
It must have been a customer.

18:56.871 --> 19:00.204
- Maybe Jessi.
- Jessi?

19:00.274 --> 19:02.208
She probably did it to make me look bad.

19:02.243 --> 19:07.045
- No, she couldn't have done it.
- Right. Jessi would never do that.

19:07.082 --> 19:10.519
She beat up Lori and took her necklace,
but she'd never steal any money.

19:15.393 --> 19:17.122
Hey, you still gotta fix this.

19:17.161 --> 19:20.097
It'll give J.T. one less thing
to fire me for.

19:20.132 --> 19:22.862
You think he'll fire you
because the money's missing?

19:22.968 --> 19:24.435
Right after he fires Amanda.

19:24.469 --> 19:27.803
So unless you can figure out
what happened, we're both doomed.

19:34.348 --> 19:37.682
I spent most of my job
trying to get kids to open up.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.279
Then one of them shows up,
crying out for my help.

19:40.355 --> 19:42.153
I slam the door in her face.

19:42.224 --> 19:45.887
I know it's a tough situation, but
you got slammed by that social worker.

19:45.928 --> 19:47.726
You can't be Jessi's sounding board.

19:47.764 --> 19:50.494
- She's a former patient.
- Well, I can't just ignore her.

19:50.534 --> 19:52.502
You have to.
They're watching you now.

19:52.569 --> 19:56.199
- Well, it's wrong.
- That's not the point.

19:56.274 --> 19:58.538
Your license is at risk.

19:58.609 --> 20:00.840
You can't jeopardize
your career over this.

20:00.913 --> 20:03.143
What's the point
of my career if I don't?

20:10.758 --> 20:13.886
Hey. How's your first day going?

20:13.961 --> 20:17.830
Not great, actually. Someone
stole money out of the register.

20:17.899 --> 20:21.460
- You think I did it.
- I wouldn't put it past you.

20:22.171 --> 20:25.766
- I'm not a thief.
- Lori's necklace notwithstanding.

20:25.808 --> 20:29.711
- I gave that back.
- Great. Now give back the money.

20:29.780 --> 20:31.179
I didn't take it.

20:32.816 --> 20:36.583
You may have everyone fooled, even Kyle.

20:36.988 --> 20:38.786
But I know what you're really about.

20:40.159 --> 20:43.686
You don't know anything.
Maybe I should call your mom again

20:43.762 --> 20:46.561
and tell her that you're here
hanging out with Kyle.

21:10.494 --> 21:13.555
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

21:13.598 --> 21:15.862
Opening drink bottles
and not drinking them.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.268
I'm trying to make up
for the missing $120.

21:20.907 --> 21:23.102
Drink company's doing
a prize giveaway game.

21:23.142 --> 21:25.407
Check under certain bottle caps,
you can win cash.

21:25.445 --> 21:28.107
- One in 20 is a winner.
- How much have you won?

21:29.349 --> 21:32.547
One free drink and a T-shirt.
But we sold eight drinks today,

21:32.620 --> 21:33.780
and nobody's won cash.

21:33.855 --> 21:36.518
The odds are one in 20,
so if I open twelve more bottles...

21:36.625 --> 21:38.058
It doesn't work that way.

21:38.093 --> 21:41.530
The odds are one in 20 for all the
bottles produced by the drink company,

21:41.565 --> 21:43.863
not just for the bottles
that are in this case.

21:44.901 --> 21:46.767
One in twenty odds?

21:50.241 --> 21:54.440
Drink company puts out a million
bottles, 950,000 of 'em are not winners.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.174
That's a lot of losers.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.151
Even if you do find a winning cap,
you have to pay for these bottles.

22:01.387 --> 22:05.449
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.
I lost my mind for a second there.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.552
Hi. Is that all for you?

22:08.596 --> 22:12.556
- I'll get one of these, too, please.
- That's $4.00.

22:15.905 --> 22:19.739
Oh, my God! I won 50 bucks!
Thank you so much.

22:19.842 --> 22:22.243
I can't believe it!
I wasn't even gonna buy that!

22:38.765 --> 22:41.256
Hey! You!

22:42.502 --> 22:44.698
- Hey.
- Get away from me.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.730
- Hey. Whoa, whoa.
- Stay away from me!

22:50.746 --> 22:52.475
- Lori!
- Dad, he tried to attack me!

22:54.917 --> 22:56.908
- Mr. Trager?
- Mark?

22:56.986 --> 22:58.112
Mark?

23:00.791 --> 23:04.124
I got those papers you wanted.
I can explain the coffee stains.

23:04.161 --> 23:08.189
- You know him?
- He's my T.A.

23:12.938 --> 23:16.374
No, J.T., everything's cool.
All right, see you soon.

23:16.442 --> 23:22.473
He'll be back in an hour. I'm screwed.

23:22.950 --> 23:24.611
Is this even close to working?

23:24.686 --> 23:27.154
I have to boost the motor's power,
but to do that...

23:27.188 --> 23:29.248
Don't explain. Just fix it.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.917
- Hey, I've been waiting.
- I know.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.730
- You said we could talk.
- It's a little crazy right now.

23:36.232 --> 23:41.432
You promised.
Are you going to turn me away again?

23:41.505 --> 23:43.700
Josh needs my help.
Can you give me more time?

23:47.913 --> 23:52.044
- No.
- Jessi! Jessi!

23:53.886 --> 23:55.911
Let her go.

23:56.456 --> 23:59.949
Why is that so hard?
What makes her so important?

24:00.027 --> 24:01.927
She said she had something
to talk about.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.193
Kyle, Jessi is not your problem.

24:04.232 --> 24:07.167
I love that you assume the best
in people, but enough is enough.

24:07.235 --> 24:11.070
Aside from everything else, she is
the one who ratted me out to my mom.

24:12.241 --> 24:14.870
- How do you know that?
- She admitted it.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.242
She is so manipulative.

24:16.346 --> 24:18.940
She lies, and then she throws it
back in your face.

24:19.015 --> 24:22.645
She makes me so uncomfortable.

24:22.687 --> 24:26.055
I know it's not the same thing, but...

24:26.158 --> 24:30.288
How'd you feel if I said I wanted
to keep hanging out with Charlie?

24:30.362 --> 24:33.730
- Guess I never thought of it that way.
- I know.

24:51.154 --> 24:53.019
Excuse me.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.065
What have you done?

25:03.101 --> 25:05.536
What you asked.
I'm fixing the smoothie machine.

25:05.571 --> 25:08.096
- With a grenade?
- The blades were damaged,

25:08.140 --> 25:10.609
so the machine was
too inefficient to blend the juice.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.237
By boosting the motor's power,
we can compensate.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.942
Unfortunately, that means rewiring
the electrical system.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.211
I'm a dead man.

25:18.119 --> 25:20.610
Someone just sprayed graffiti
in the bathroom.

25:20.721 --> 25:24.317
"For a good time,
call Dava Vina 535..."

25:24.359 --> 25:25.690
I know the number.

25:29.365 --> 25:31.026
What's going on?

25:31.067 --> 25:34.162
The smoothie machine's motor
is broken, so until I fix it...

25:34.205 --> 25:35.832
No, I mean with you and Amanda.

25:35.873 --> 25:37.135
Are you guys fighting?

25:37.174 --> 25:39.302
She doesn't want me
to be around Jessi.

25:39.344 --> 25:43.644
Well... Amanda doesn't have to know
you're hanging out with her.

25:43.682 --> 25:44.911
I won't lie to her.

25:46.986 --> 25:48.647
Then try the four magic words.

25:48.688 --> 25:51.214
- "You're right. I'm sorry."
- I should apologize,

25:51.258 --> 25:53.249
though I don't think
I've done anything wrong?

25:53.327 --> 25:55.090
Hell, yes.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.996
Sometimes you gotta let them be right,

25:58.066 --> 26:00.057
even though you know they're wrong.

26:00.101 --> 26:01.694
Or they'll take their business
somewhere else.

26:02.304 --> 26:05.705
- What?
- The customer's always right.

26:05.741 --> 26:08.040
Yeah, something like that.

26:09.412 --> 26:12.176
I'm telling you, those four words
are an instant cure.

26:12.215 --> 26:14.184
Your fight's over.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.777
You can move right on
to the makeup sex...

26:16.821 --> 26:20.451
...or in your case, makeup hugs.

26:37.979 --> 26:40.743
Water seems to be working.
I'll go find some eye drops.

26:41.784 --> 26:43.342
Well, look at the bright side.

26:43.386 --> 26:46.412
I think the pepper spray
got the coffee stain out of your shirt.

26:46.455 --> 26:48.253
Yeah, and that's a real priority now.

26:48.292 --> 26:50.954
Hey, I said I was sorry.

26:50.994 --> 26:55.159
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- I suppose you're entitled to one.

26:55.233 --> 26:58.601
- Why are you so angry?
- Um, let me see.

26:58.637 --> 27:01.299
I guess it started when you let
the door hit me in the face.

27:01.340 --> 27:02.398
Unintentionally.

27:02.474 --> 27:05.342
You branded me a callous jerk
without proper provocation.

27:05.412 --> 27:08.142
When it comes down to it,
aren't you all callous jerks?

27:08.181 --> 27:11.640
I see. So some guy did you wrong,
and I'm the one who gets pepper sprayed.

27:11.719 --> 27:14.586
- Aren't you insightful?
- Oh, so I'm right?

27:14.655 --> 27:19.821
- No, you're arrogant and conceited.
- And you're bitter and hostile.

27:19.895 --> 27:23.696
You sure you don't want a second spray?
I'd be happy to oblige.

27:23.766 --> 27:26.132
Man, I think you already
emptied the whole can.

27:27.538 --> 27:29.403
Don't count on it.

27:38.484 --> 27:41.681
I'm sorry I snapped.
The stress is really getting to me.

27:42.588 --> 27:45.649
- I know it's been rough.
- I thought I could handle it.

27:45.759 --> 27:48.125
I mean, this job
is the one thing I'm good at,

27:48.228 --> 27:49.992
and I've totally screwed it up.

27:50.031 --> 27:52.727
I've managed to double the power
to the smoothie machine.

27:52.767 --> 27:57.330
Great, but the money's still missing.
Can't you do something Kyle-like?

27:59.174 --> 28:01.143
I can access my holographic memory.

28:01.244 --> 28:04.407
It lets me reexamine
past events from every angle.

28:04.481 --> 28:08.282
I thought you could do
something cool, like make money.

28:08.352 --> 28:10.513
OK, do your holodeck whatever thing.

28:27.307 --> 28:29.367
<i>In replaying the day,
I once again saw</i>

28:29.411 --> 28:32.403
<i>every encounter
with disgruntled customers.</i>

28:32.447 --> 28:36.111
<i>It was a chaotic day where
nothing seemed to go right.</i>

28:36.152 --> 28:40.954
<i>Well, almost nothing. There was one
thing that made everything worthwhile.</i>

28:40.991 --> 28:44.552
Take the seed out of the avocado before
you put it in the smoothie machine.

28:44.594 --> 28:46.961
<i>Amanda's reassuring touch.</i>

28:47.031 --> 28:50.159
I can't help it if all I want to do
is be alone with you.

28:50.201 --> 28:52.602
<i>Her playful laugh.</i>

28:52.671 --> 28:55.697
Kyle? Could you help me
in the storage room for a minute?

28:55.774 --> 28:56.866
Sure.

28:56.909 --> 28:59.674
<i>And most of all,
the sweetness of her kiss.</i>

29:01.448 --> 29:04.418
<i>These moments made
all of my other problems disappear.</i>

29:06.187 --> 29:09.954
Being somebody's first can
mean something completely different.

29:09.991 --> 29:13.552
- I want to be your first customer.
- I knew what you meant.

29:17.066 --> 29:19.661
- Is this what you need?
- Thanks.

29:22.906 --> 29:24.498
<i>That was it.</i>

29:32.151 --> 29:33.982
Well, what happened to the cash?

29:35.821 --> 29:39.053
- It was never in the cash drawer.
- What?

29:39.092 --> 29:41.652
I replayed the day
back to the beginning.

29:41.695 --> 29:45.029
Right before Amanda took my order,
I helped her with the cash drawer.

29:45.099 --> 29:46.999
Each bill weighs one gram.

29:47.034 --> 29:49.026
The drawer was nine grams too light.

29:49.104 --> 29:51.766
Based on the levels of denominations,

29:51.840 --> 29:55.538
it looked like four twenties,
three tens and two fives were missing.

29:55.612 --> 29:59.515
That's a total of $120 that was missing
before the cash was put in the register.

29:59.583 --> 30:00.777
Whoa.

30:00.851 --> 30:03.615
A superhuman memory bank
with a built-in scale.

30:03.654 --> 30:07.489
You count the money in the drawer
before the start of the day?

30:07.526 --> 30:09.824
No. I was training Amanda.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.763
- J.T. counted it.
- Maybe he made a mistake.

30:12.832 --> 30:15.562
Yeah, blaming my boss,
that'll go over big.

30:16.737 --> 30:19.968
It's OK. I'll take the heat for this.

30:20.007 --> 30:22.704
- Amanda's in the clear.
- But it wasn't your fault.

30:22.744 --> 30:25.076
That's what happens when you're the man.

30:25.113 --> 30:27.240
I cancered my way into front-row seats.

30:27.315 --> 30:28.374
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hi.

30:28.417 --> 30:32.478
FYI? I implied you had cancer, too.
So we might have to shave your head.

30:32.555 --> 30:36.253
- It's a fitting end to a horrible day.
- What happened?

30:36.326 --> 30:40.229
There's 120 bucks missing from
the cash register. I'm totally fired.

30:40.298 --> 30:44.998
Well, if J.T. busts you for that,
you can bust him for playing hooky.

30:45.037 --> 30:47.028
<i>I saw him in line
for the Cow Keys tickets.</i>

30:48.540 --> 30:50.441
Tickets that cost $120.

30:55.415 --> 30:57.543
J.T. took the money
to buy concert tickets?

30:57.585 --> 30:58.813
Doesn't make sense.

30:58.886 --> 31:01.720
He'd know the register'd
come up short. He'd get caught.

31:01.756 --> 31:04.418
That's why he put you in charge.
You're his fall guy.

31:04.459 --> 31:06.859
That bastard's gonna be here any minute.

31:06.928 --> 31:08.055
What do I do?

31:13.470 --> 31:15.597
Maybe I boosted the power too much.

31:15.639 --> 31:19.406
You think?

31:20.211 --> 31:22.008
You've got to be kidding me.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.647
On the bright side, the missing money

31:26.685 --> 31:28.880
isn't the first thing
your boss will notice.

31:48.811 --> 31:50.278
I'm sorry about the smoothie machine.

31:52.716 --> 31:54.308
It's fine.

31:55.953 --> 32:00.482
Amanda, I just wanted you to know
that Jessi didn't take the money,

32:00.525 --> 32:04.018
and it's not our fault, either.
The manager stole it.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.393
That's great.

32:12.239 --> 32:14.036
You're right. I'm sorry.

32:15.175 --> 32:18.976
- What?
- You're right. I'm sorry?

32:21.016 --> 32:23.541
Does that mean you won't
hang out with Jessi anymore?

32:26.355 --> 32:29.086
Please tell me, why do you
want to be friends with her?

32:29.125 --> 32:31.150
I mean, she's creepy, and she's strange,

32:31.194 --> 32:34.255
and she beat up your sister,
yet everyone's fine with it.

32:34.298 --> 32:39.362
I know it's hard to understand.
You have to trust me.

32:39.404 --> 32:42.669
Trust you?
Haven't I been trusting enough?

32:45.244 --> 32:47.075
Go on, Kyle and Jessi,
stroke each other's bellies.

32:47.113 --> 32:49.344
Have a nice road trip.
Hey, while you're gone,

32:49.383 --> 32:51.977
is there a love song I can play
for the two of you?

32:52.052 --> 32:54.043
The problem isn't that
I don't trust you,

32:54.088 --> 32:57.547
- it's that you don't trust me.
- I trust you completely.

32:57.592 --> 32:58.752
Really?

32:58.827 --> 33:01.319
Then what's the deal
with that weird box,

33:01.364 --> 33:03.798
the one I pulled out
of the underground death trap?

33:03.866 --> 33:05.800
The one you almost
got yourself killed for?

33:09.139 --> 33:11.437
Jessi knows what it is, doesn't she?

33:11.475 --> 33:13.307
Amanda...

33:13.378 --> 33:16.108
You can trust her with
your secrets and not me,

33:16.180 --> 33:17.671
and until you can do that,

33:17.716 --> 33:20.241
maybe I'm the one you shouldn't
be hanging out with.

33:32.233 --> 33:34.759
It's a total no-win situation.

33:34.803 --> 33:40.036
If I say I don't know what happened
to the money, I'm fired.

33:41.444 --> 33:44.902
If I tell J.T. I know he stole it,
but can't prove it,

33:44.981 --> 33:48.110
then it's his word against mine,
and I'm fired.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.484
If I don't tell Amanda my secrets,
I risk losing her.

33:50.521 --> 33:53.514
- If I do tell her, I risk losing her.
- You don't know that.

33:53.591 --> 33:55.650
Secrets ruined
your relationship with Lori.

33:55.727 --> 33:58.253
Openness and honesty
hasn't exactly worked, either.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.629
Let Amanda cool off.
She'll be more reasonable.

34:00.699 --> 34:04.466
I think she is being reasonable.
How can we have a real relationship

34:04.504 --> 34:06.438
if she doesn't know
the truth about me?

34:06.473 --> 34:09.500
- Then tell her.
- Then she'd know I'd been lying to her.

34:09.577 --> 34:10.668
She'll forgive you.

34:10.745 --> 34:12.042
Like she forgave Charlie?

34:12.080 --> 34:14.071
That's different.
You lied to protect her.

34:14.148 --> 34:16.674
Charlie lied to protect himself.

34:17.886 --> 34:19.911
But what if she looks at me differently?

34:19.989 --> 34:22.184
What if she
doesn't like who I really am?

34:22.225 --> 34:26.219
Then I guess telling her is one way to
know if you should really be together.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.097
Amanda!

34:37.210 --> 34:38.507
We need to talk.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.638
Look, if you're going
to break up with me, please,

34:41.681 --> 34:44.014
don't draw it out, just do it quick.

34:44.051 --> 34:46.143
I'm not gonna break up with you.

34:48.523 --> 34:50.684
I need you in my life.

34:50.725 --> 34:53.922
I need you in every part of it.

34:56.699 --> 35:00.136
OK. So let's talk.

35:07.311 --> 35:09.074
Well, I guess I'll see you around.

35:09.147 --> 35:10.877
I mean, once I can see again.

35:10.916 --> 35:13.248
Well, watch your step
and I'll go easy on you.

35:13.318 --> 35:16.481
- Declan.
- Hey.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.382
I'll see you.

35:22.363 --> 35:26.459
- Who was that?
- Some guy I pepper-sprayed.

35:26.534 --> 35:29.993
- Why did you do that?
- He pissed me off.

35:30.071 --> 35:34.509
- I'm sensing a pattern.
- Oh, I see.

35:34.544 --> 35:37.479
I'm being irrational?
What about you, Mister all-up-in-arms

35:37.513 --> 35:39.846
when I say an innocent
hello to your girlfriend?

35:39.883 --> 35:44.286
A, she's not my new girlfriend,
and B, your tone was hardly innocent.

35:44.354 --> 35:46.721
Oh, what was it, then?

35:48.026 --> 35:50.860
Passive-aggressive
mean girl comes to mind.

35:50.896 --> 35:53.592
You are so not-allowed
to use my own phrases against me.

35:53.632 --> 35:54.724
Trager...

36:00.073 --> 36:01.665
You're right.

36:01.741 --> 36:06.441
- What?
- You're right. I'm sorry.

36:07.549 --> 36:09.847
I'm totally not falling for that.

36:18.795 --> 36:20.195
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

36:20.264 --> 36:22.198
<i>- Hey.
- Hello.</i>

36:22.233 --> 36:24.930
Mr. Taylor... Brian.

36:24.970 --> 36:28.565
<i>- It's Nicole Trager.
- Yes?</i>

36:28.640 --> 36:30.165
I just wanted to let you know

36:30.209 --> 36:33.372
I saw Jessi earlier
and she seemed troubled,

36:33.446 --> 36:36.939
and I tried to explain to her that it's
difficult for me to talk to her now,

36:37.017 --> 36:38.951
since I'm not her therapist,

36:38.986 --> 36:43.356
but I want to let her know
that I do care about her.

36:43.391 --> 36:47.761
Well, I'm sure she'd be glad hear that.
She's just not in right now.

36:47.796 --> 36:50.697
<i>Well, could you
let her know that I called?</i>

36:50.733 --> 36:52.998
Please tell her
that I'm thinking about her.

36:53.036 --> 36:56.233
<i>- Absolutely.
- Thanks.</i>

36:58.542 --> 37:02.740
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

37:09.187 --> 37:10.712
What's wrong?

37:12.292 --> 37:14.317
You were right.

37:14.394 --> 37:19.025
Kyle doesn't care.
He won't even talk to me.

37:19.066 --> 37:20.727
And neither will Nicole.

37:23.071 --> 37:27.031
I tried to explain. They're not family.

37:27.076 --> 37:30.876
But I just want to be their friend,
but they won't let me.

37:33.450 --> 37:36.783
They're jealous.
You know what you're capable of,

37:36.853 --> 37:39.152
but they don't want to see you succeed.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.885
Not like I do.

37:51.071 --> 37:53.403
I'm your father, Jess.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.032
I will never let you down.

38:00.381 --> 38:04.341
The place is clean.
The smoothie machine is fixed.

38:04.386 --> 38:07.254
Now if only I could find $120
lying around somewhere.

38:14.164 --> 38:17.190
<i>I scalped the Cow Keys tickets.</i>

38:17.234 --> 38:21.331
But I thought you were really
looking forward to seeing them live?

38:21.406 --> 38:24.934
No, I was really looking forward
to spending time with you.

38:33.453 --> 38:37.618
So... how did it go?

38:37.725 --> 38:40.559
- No worries.
- All right.

38:46.569 --> 38:48.935
There's so much we don't know
about each other.

38:49.005 --> 38:50.370
Yeah.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.500
And I want to know
everything about you.

38:53.310 --> 38:56.143
I want to know everything
about you, too.

38:56.180 --> 39:00.641
But I think we should take it slow.
Savor each new thing.

39:00.685 --> 39:04.144
- One step at a time?
- Exactly.

39:04.190 --> 39:06.249
So how about this?

39:06.292 --> 39:08.818
I'll tell you something
you don't know about me,

39:08.862 --> 39:11.592
and then you tell me something
I don't know about you.

39:11.665 --> 39:13.030
Yeah.

39:15.303 --> 39:16.600
OK.

39:17.739 --> 39:20.573
So that box you asked me about,

39:20.609 --> 39:24.272
it belonged to someone
very close to me.

39:24.313 --> 39:27.340
But you found that box underground.
Whose was it?

39:27.451 --> 39:32.685
- My biological father.
- Your biological father?

39:32.723 --> 39:35.419
A man named Adam Baylin.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.362
He worked in that facility
many years ago.

39:41.066 --> 39:43.934
- I don't understand.
- It's OK.

39:44.003 --> 39:46.301
Eventually, you will.

39:46.339 --> 39:51.334
Now it's your turn. Tell me something
I don't already know about you.

39:51.378 --> 39:54.610
- I really like kissing you.
- That doesn't count, I know that.

39:54.683 --> 39:58.813
- I really, really like kissing you?
- Sorry, I know that, too.

39:58.887 --> 40:01.618
- My favorite ice cream flavor is...
- Double mint chip.

40:24.117 --> 40:27.678
- Register balances out.
- You sound surprised.

40:27.721 --> 40:31.385
Oh, no. No, no. Good work.

40:31.425 --> 40:34.884
So I gotta take off. So, cool.

40:34.930 --> 40:38.491
<i>- Don't forget to lock up.
- Have fun at the Cow Keys concert.</i>

40:39.836 --> 40:41.929
Those tickets are really expensive.

40:41.971 --> 40:45.908
What do they cost? Like, 120 bucks?

40:45.943 --> 40:50.175
Some people would do almost
anything to get those tickets.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.012
I guess you really lucked out, huh?

40:53.885 --> 40:55.648
Next time, you might not be so lucky.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.092
With what you've got over him,

41:04.164 --> 41:06.257
I bet you get the raise
sooner rather than later.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.896
- Hush money.
- Or buy Andy something pretty money.

41:09.938 --> 41:11.565
Has a better ring to it.

41:11.606 --> 41:14.337
You know, I may have
given up our tickets,

41:14.410 --> 41:16.503
but I was able to get
the next best thing.

41:22.085 --> 41:23.450
When did this go on sale?

41:23.486 --> 41:25.478
It hasn't. Promo copy.

41:25.523 --> 41:28.617
Doesn't go on sale for two weeks,
but Mama's got people who know people.

41:30.562 --> 41:32.928
Yeah, I figured you'd
want to give it a listen.

41:32.965 --> 41:35.695
Only if we can listen to it together.

41:38.037 --> 41:41.131
There's a CD player in the storage room.

41:41.174 --> 41:43.268
Sounds like an ultimatum.

41:43.310 --> 41:46.370
Sometimes it's the only thing
girls will respond to.

41:51.052 --> 41:53.385
Two years ago,
I actually went to band camp.

41:53.456 --> 41:55.651
I saw the photo on your wall.

41:55.758 --> 41:58.226
At this rate, I'll never learn
anything about you.

41:58.260 --> 42:00.889
Well, then I guess
it could take a while.

42:09.207 --> 42:12.336
You'd better get inside
before your mom sees us.

42:36.773 --> 42:37.831
Foss?

42:39.309 --> 42:41.402
Foss, I got your message.

42:41.445 --> 42:43.879
It wasn't from Foss.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.988
Adam.

42:52.458 --> 42:54.085
Hello, Kyle.
