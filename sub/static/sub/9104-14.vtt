&lrm;you don't look well.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.800
&lrm;I need you to take me to a doctor.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.800
&lrm;But where will I find
&lrm;a doctor for kwamis?

01:02.960 --> 01:04.640
&lrm;I know a healer.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.480
&lrm;I'll tell you where to go.

&lrm;What will I tell him?
&lrm;You're a secret.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.640
&lrm;He'll ask questions.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.240
&lrm;And I know someone else
&lrm;who'll ask a lot of questions,

01:14.400 --> 01:16.640
&lrm;my teacher,
&lrm;about why I'm late again.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.160
&lrm;Tikki, can I take you to the healer

&lrm;He's so gorgeous,
&lrm;and with a heart of gold.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.400
&lrm;I'm going to write him a letter

01:48.560 --> 01:51.120
&lrm;professing my adoration
&lrm;and utmost respect.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.120
&lrm;Marinette, what's your excuse this time?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.720
&lrm;Locked yourself
&lrm;in the bathroom again?

01:58.880 --> 02:00.600
&lrm;No, of course not.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.960
&lrm;I had to... take my dog... to the vet,

02:03.120 --> 02:05.040
&lrm;because he... ate a wool sweater.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.160

&lrm;but it turns out
&lrm;it's Rose's perfume.

&lrm;You're both always late.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.920
&lrm;As he missed class, it'd be sweet

03:04.080 --> 03:07.800
&lrm;if some lady could lend him
&lrm;her notes so he can get up to speed?

03:07.960 --> 03:09.120
&lrm;You're right...

03:09.280 --> 03:10.920
&lrm;Oh, you mean for me

03:11.080 --> 03:12.720
&lrm;to give him my notes?

03:14.920 --> 03:17.040
&lrm;No, I can't, I...

03:17.200 --> 03:19.160

&lrm;[sneezing]
&lrm;I think I'm getting sick.

&lrm;Then don't breathe on him.

&lrm;Don't worry, Tikki,
&lrm;it'll just take...

&lrm;[Tikki groans]

03:37.120 --> 03:38.680
&lrm;You OK? Nothing broken?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.600

03:49.760 --> 03:52.080
&lrm;Sabrina,
&lrm;what's Prince Ali doing today?

03:52.240 --> 03:54.440
&lrm;A toy drive
&lrm;at the Children's Hospital.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.480
&lrm;What kind of stuffed animal is this?

03:57.640 --> 03:59.160
&lrm;Who left this here?

04:00.760 --> 04:04.000
&lrm;The prince will never have seen
&lrm;one like this before.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.400
&lrm;And when he sees me,

04:05.560 --> 04:08.640
&lrm;Prince Ali will forget
&lrm;all about those sick kids.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.040
&lrm;Did I hear you say Prince Ali?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.720
&lrm;Not to you.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.360
&lrm;Prince Ali's staying
&lrm;at Chloe's dad's hotel.

04:17.519 --> 04:21.920
&lrm;The only hotel fit for a prince
&lrm;and I'll be the first to meet him.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.160
&lrm;Please, could you give him
&lrm;a special letter?

04:25.320 --> 04:26.400
&lrm;No prob.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.480
&lrm;That is so sweet of you
&lrm;to do that for me.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.520
&lrm;You thought I was serious?

04:34.680 --> 04:37.720
&lrm;You think I want to
&lrm;get anywhere near this fish funk?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.720
&lrm;[Marinette] Tikki?

04:52.200 --> 04:53.920
&lrm;Chloe, wait up! That's my...

04:54.080 --> 04:56.320
&lrm;Not anymore. Finders keepers.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.080

05:27.760 --> 05:31.600
&lrm;Now there's a broken-hearted

&lrm;Every rose has its thorns.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.840

&lrm;Hello, I'm in Chloe's class.
&lrm;I really have to see her.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.160
&lrm;Are you a friend?

06:36.320 --> 06:37.640
&lrm;A friend of Chloe's?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.560
&lrm;You must be kidding.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.680
&lrm;I mean, we're in the same class.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.200
&lrm;If you're not a friend,
&lrm;then I can't.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.480
&lrm;Yes, I'm a friend of Chloe's.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.880
&lrm;We're BFFs.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.920
&lrm;Chloe doesn't have any friends.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.840
&lrm;Does that mean...
&lrm;you're not letting me in?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.080
&lrm;No.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.320
&lrm;Got a pizza for Chloe Bourgeois.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.800
&lrm;It's usually sushi.

&lrm;Yes, yes, yes.

&lrm;[lift beeps]

07:26.960 --> 07:29.600
&lrm;Here's a gift for the sick children,
&lrm;Prince.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.880
&lrm;It's nothing, really.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.360
&lrm;Stop flattering me.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.440
&lrm;No.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.960
&lrm;There, that's better.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.920
&lrm;[lift beeps]

07:42.680 --> 07:43.720
&lrm;Chloe!

07:43.880 --> 07:44.720
&lrm;Wait!

07:45.160 --> 07:46.240
&lrm;Pizza?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.280
&lrm;Don't get that peasant food near me.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.680
&lrm;Wait! It has truffles
&lrm;and caviar on it,

07:50.840 --> 07:52.520
&lrm;for spoilt brats like you.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.920
&lrm;I've come to see Prince Ali.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.480
&lrm;What is going on today?

08:03.640 --> 08:05.240
&lrm;Do you have an appointment?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.600
&lrm;No need. I'm his princess.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.440
&lrm;And I'm a monkey's uncle.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.800

&lrm;Now,
&lrm;where is my wonderful Prince Charming?

08:23.320 --> 08:25.280
&lrm;We can't keep him waiting.

&lrm;In honour of your presence
&lrm;here in Paris, Your Highness,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.159
&lrm;I've taken it on myself
&lrm;to organise a fireworks display

08:33.320 --> 08:35.200
&lrm;on the Seine River.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.039
&lrm;They will be displayed
&lrm;from this barge.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.120
&lrm;Thank you...
&lrm;How do we say in your language?

08:44.280 --> 08:45.560
&lrm;Totally awesome!

08:45.720 --> 08:48.120
&lrm;We'll see if it fits in
&lrm;with his schedule.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.240
&lrm;We have little time for festivities.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.520
&lrm;His Highness
&lrm;has many responsibilities.

&lrm;Prince, I've brought you
&lrm;a special stuffed toy

09:08.920 --> 09:10.920
&lrm;for the sick children.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.360
&lrm;I've never seen one like this.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.320
&lrm;It's very kind of you.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.440
&lrm;You're flattering me.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.960
&lrm;It is so kind of me though,
&lrm;isn't it?

09:21.120 --> 09:23.280
&lrm;Yes, I say that.
&lrm;You did not hear me?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.720
&lrm;that smell coming from?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.200
&lrm;Like rotten fish.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.600
&lrm;[gagging]

09:52.760 --> 09:54.840
&lrm;What? That's not me.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.000
&lrm;This is bad.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.320
&lrm;What or who is that? Plagg?

10:23.480 --> 10:25.160
&lrm;Plagg?
&lrm;There's trouble in Paris.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.520
&lrm;I'm still chewing.

&lrm;Prince, this way.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.280
&lrm;We're safe.
&lrm;It's a reinforced door.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.080
&lrm;So much chaos.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.600
&lrm;How is one supposed to stick
&lrm;to a schedule around here?

11:08.800 --> 11:10.000
&lrm;What is that?

11:10.160 --> 11:11.960
&lrm;[hissing]

&lrm;Who are you?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.680
&lrm;Looks like you're powerless now.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.400
&lrm;No!

11:34.560 --> 11:37.160
&lrm;There are two of them now. Run!

&lrm;Shut it now!

12:25.600 --> 12:26.920
&lrm;[servant]
&lrm;At your service.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.680
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;Come into my arms,

12:28.840 --> 12:29.920
&lrm;my sweet prince.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.320
&lrm;[Cat Noir gags]
&lrm;Can we get some fresh air in here?

12:35.920 --> 12:38.040
&lrm;No-one will take my prince away!

12:48.920 --> 12:51.120
&lrm;Emergency evacuation.
&lrm;Everybody down.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.960
&lrm;It's much too dangerous
&lrm;for the prince.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.840
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;You're right...

12:57.000 --> 12:58.200
&lrm;safety first.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.360
&lrm;[yelling]

13:01.520 --> 13:02.480
&lrm;[cry of joy]

13:02.640 --> 13:03.800
&lrm;[yelling]

13:08.120 --> 13:09.720
&lrm;My prince!

13:13.800 --> 13:16.520
&lrm;Tikki, please be OK.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.440
&lrm;Can we open the windows?

13:22.600 --> 13:25.240
&lrm;This fish smell
&lrm;is even too much for a cat.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.760
&lrm;[Tikki sneezes]

13:28.920 --> 13:30.440
&lrm;We've 9 minutes

13:30.600 --> 13:33.520
&lrm;to get to the hospital,
&lrm;we're on a strict schedule.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.000
&lrm;No way we can go
&lrm;go to the hospital now.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.240
&lrm;We gotta get Prince Ali
&lrm;out of Paris.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.280
&lrm;My prince, fancy seeing you here,

13:41.440 --> 13:42.520
&lrm;what luck.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.720
&lrm;The windows!

13:44.680 --> 13:48.240
&lrm;I'll take you to the Pont des Arts
&lrm;where we'll seal our love.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.600
&lrm;Cat Noir is down.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.040
&lrm;It won't be long

13:56.200 --> 13:59.400
&lrm;before Ladybug shows up too
&lrm;and meets her doom.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.840
&lrm;[evil laugh]

14:05.840 --> 14:08.760
&lrm;No. Where's Tikki?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.280
&lrm;Tikki?

14:10.440 --> 14:11.760
&lrm;Tikki?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.720
&lrm;Tikki, I was so worried.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.240
&lrm;Marinette...

14:17.400 --> 14:20.400
&lrm;You're worse than I thought.
&lrm;We need to get help.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.920
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;We have no time.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.120
&lrm;You need to transform.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.040
&lrm;I'll be OK.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.480
&lrm;[coughing]

14:27.640 --> 14:30.280
&lrm;I'm not making
&lrm;the same mistake twice.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.680
&lrm;We've got to get you
&lrm;to the healer, now.

14:35.080 --> 14:42.680
&lrm;[Chinese gong rings]

14:42.840 --> 14:44.040
&lrm;Is she gonna be OK?

14:44.600 --> 14:47.800
&lrm;One who burns with impatience
&lrm;can never eat hot porridge.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.520
&lrm;What has this got to do with eating?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.400
&lrm;Silence, please.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.200
&lrm;Reading energies...

14:57.760 --> 14:59.200
&lrm;What type of cat did you say?

14:59.320 --> 15:00.480
&lrm;Cat?...

15:00.640 --> 15:04.280
&lrm;rare hairless flying species
&lrm;from the Kingdom of Atchoo.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.920
&lrm;I won one in a zoo tap-dancing
&lrm;contest when I was in... Atchoo.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.520
&lrm;I see, unusual.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.840
&lrm;Yes, yes, very.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.760
&lrm;[gong rings]
&lrm;We are finished.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.760
&lrm;Your cat's health has been restored.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.640
&lrm;[Tikki mumbles]

15:23.080 --> 15:26.920
&lrm;Thank you so much.
&lrm;You're a real magician, sir.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.920
&lrm;How did you do that?

15:30.080 --> 15:32.160
&lrm;Ancient Chinese secret.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.400
&lrm;Just like yours.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.280
&lrm;Tikki, I'm so sorry.
&lrm;You were so sick and...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.600
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;what I'd do without you.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.720
&lrm;You wouldn't be Ladybug, for one.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.640
&lrm;I know, but I mean...

15:46.800 --> 15:49.560
&lrm;Tikki, you're more
&lrm;than just my kwami to me.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.400
&lrm;I know.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.480
&lrm;The Pont des Arts bridge,
&lrm;That's where they're headed.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.600
&lrm;I heard it in the car.
&lrm;Hurry, we've no time to lose.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.720
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

16:27.760 --> 16:31.600
&lrm;I can't wait for us
&lrm;to be together forever.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.520
&lrm;Servant, love padlock, please.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.320
&lrm;[tinkling]

16:37.480 --> 16:40.120
&lrm;This will lock our love forever,
&lrm;my prince.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.880
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;At your service, Princess Fragrance.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.920
&lrm;[Princess Fragrance]
&lrm;My padlock!

16:47.920 --> 16:50.560
&lrm;Not so fast,
&lrm;royal pains in the neck.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.640
&lrm;[angry growling]

16:58.560 --> 17:00.080
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Use Cat Noir

17:00.240 --> 17:02.040
&lrm;to get Ladybug's Miraculous.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.040
&lrm;Servants, attack!
&lrm;And take her earrings!

17:13.640 --> 17:15.240
&lrm;[struggling]

17:27.880 --> 17:29.400
&lrm;Snap out of it, Cat Noir.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.880
&lrm;It's me, Ladybug.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.960
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.360
&lrm;Who needs a padlock
&lrm;to secure our love

17:39.520 --> 17:41.680
&lrm;when I can put everyone
&lrm;under my spell

17:41.840 --> 17:43.920
&lrm;and make Paris our kingdom?

17:44.080 --> 17:48.240
&lrm;[hissing]

17:50.760 --> 17:52.400
&lrm;I'd better do something

17:52.560 --> 17:55.200
&lrm;before this whole thing
&lrm;blows up in my face.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
&lrm;Watch what happens when you play
&lrm;with flammable substances...

18:10.560 --> 18:11.640
&lrm;Can't hit me.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.120
&lrm;Missed.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.480
&lrm;Yeah!

18:24.920 --> 18:26.240
&lrm;Nice of you to drop in.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.600
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;Give me you Miraculous.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.680
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;Cataclysm!

18:40.520 --> 18:41.920
&lrm;[fizzing]

18:56.000 --> 18:57.920
&lrm;[loud explosion]

19:00.000 --> 19:03.520
&lrm;This city's not for us.
&lrm;Too many people want to bother us.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.920
&lrm;Let's go far away from here,
&lrm;my prince, very far.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.080
&lrm;Leaving so soon?

19:08.240 --> 19:09.840
&lrm;The party just got started!

19:10.120 --> 19:13.080
&lrm;You? You are ruining everything!

19:13.240 --> 19:14.720
&lrm;So now I'll ruin you!

19:15.360 --> 19:16.960
&lrm;Lucky charm!

19:21.440 --> 19:24.040
&lrm;A balloon?
&lrm;What do I do with this?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.200
&lrm;You can't escape, Ladybug
&lrm;It's over!

19:33.080 --> 19:34.760
&lrm;What the...?

19:42.360 --> 19:45.080
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.320
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:54.560 --> 19:55.680
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:57.120 --> 19:58.760
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.360
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

20:04.720 --> 20:07.440
&lrm;What am I doing here?
&lrm;And where's Ladybug?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.560
&lrm;The schedule's a complete disaster.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.960
&lrm;We're going to be late
&lrm;for everything.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.280
&lrm;Where's the Prince?

20:15.440 --> 20:17.720
&lrm;Wait a minute... where am I?

20:19.320 --> 20:20.880
&lrm;[Prince Ali]
&lrm;How did I get here?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.880
&lrm;[Rose gasps]
&lrm;Prince Ali?

20:27.440 --> 20:28.640
&lrm;And who are you?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.640
&lrm;Never mind, I'll leave you
&lrm;with your biggest fan.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.440
&lrm;Bug out!

20:34.440 --> 20:37.240
&lrm;You know how you're always helping
&lrm;sick children?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.760
&lrm;I want you to know
&lrm;that you are the most

20:39.920 --> 20:41.880
&lrm;kind-hearted person
&lrm;I have ever met.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.240
&lrm;Really?

20:43.800 --> 20:44.760
&lrm;Prince Ali!

20:44.920 --> 20:47.080
&lrm;You're safe.
&lrm;Aren't you glad I'm safe too?

20:47.240 --> 20:48.920
&lrm;Shall we continue
&lrm;where we left off?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.080
&lrm;No, thank you.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.600
&lrm;I have a special event
&lrm;at the hospital with Miss Rose.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.120
&lrm;Let us go quickly
&lrm;before my chaperone locates me.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.200
&lrm;Bye, Chloe.
