WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:04.304
Drop me off at the courthouse, would you?

00:04.306 --> 00:06.606
The group has heard my story
over and over.

00:06.608 --> 00:08.274
Well, that's what we're here for.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.208
How was the job search?

00:09.210 --> 00:10.810
It just wasn't a perfect fit.

00:10.812 --> 00:13.279
- Did you get it?
- Shittin' gold.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.981
Madrigal has eight
terminals in the southwest.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.882
One down, seven to go.

00:17.884 --> 00:20.319
"I'm proud we share the name McGill."

00:20.321 --> 00:21.787
Man could write a letter.

00:21.789 --> 00:25.365
I know what you've done.
The Salamancas do not.

01:54.678 --> 01:57.196
You wanted me to talk.

01:57.815 --> 01:59.882
I talked.

02:14.283 --> 02:22.293
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:36.155 --> 04:37.603
Done.

04:54.539 --> 04:56.005
James McGill.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.608
James, hi.
It's Robbie Finn from CC Mobile.

04:58.643 --> 04:59.843
Hi.

04:59.878 --> 05:01.478
Am I calling at a bad time?

05:01.513 --> 05:02.779
No. It's fine. Um...

05:02.814 --> 05:04.413
Great. Well, good news...

05:04.449 --> 05:05.982
if you're still interested,
we'd like to offer you

05:06.017 --> 05:08.379
a position at our uptown branch.

05:09.354 --> 05:11.654
Oh, this is the cellphone store?

05:11.690 --> 05:12.922
You bet!

05:12.958 --> 05:15.157
You made quite an impression on Mr. Boyd.

05:15.193 --> 05:17.693
He's talking about starting
you off as a shift supervisor.

05:17.728 --> 05:20.329
We can get your training done
today, if that works for you.

05:23.901 --> 05:26.322
James? You still there?

05:28.239 --> 05:29.872
I'm sorry.

05:29.907 --> 05:32.108
Uh, my plans have changed.

05:32.143 --> 05:34.443
I'm not gonna be able to take that job.

05:34.479 --> 05:36.112
Yeah? I'm sorry to hear that.

05:36.147 --> 05:38.514
Me too. It's a real shame.

05:38.549 --> 05:41.017
Alright, well, have yourself
a good day, James.

05:41.052 --> 05:42.918
You too.

06:13.116 --> 06:15.250
You taking off?

06:15.285 --> 06:17.018
Yeah.

06:17.054 --> 06:18.719
Hey, you want Thai for dinner?

06:18.755 --> 06:20.755
I got a hankering for that iced tea.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.490
Yeah. That sounds good.

06:22.526 --> 06:25.193
I should be back by 7:00.

06:25.228 --> 06:26.961
Excellent.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.067
What's up?

06:34.217 --> 06:36.370
I was thinking that...

06:38.274 --> 06:40.074
...maybe you should talk to someone.

06:41.981 --> 06:43.247
Yeah?

06:43.272 --> 06:46.073
Yeah. I got a name.

06:48.631 --> 06:51.498
He's not far from here.
I've heard good things.

06:52.188 --> 06:53.835
Thought you'd give him a call.

06:55.071 --> 06:56.520
A shrink?

06:58.096 --> 07:00.341
It works for a lot of people.

07:02.745 --> 07:04.311
Yeah. Okay.

07:04.347 --> 07:07.047
Um...

07:07.082 --> 07:09.015
Yeah, well, thank you.

07:11.019 --> 07:14.020
Um... I just, uh, have to, uh...

07:15.491 --> 07:17.791
I hafta check out my schedule and...

07:17.827 --> 07:19.793
Oh, geez.

07:21.163 --> 07:23.063
I almost forgot to tell you.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.032
I got a job.

07:26.068 --> 07:28.134
- Really?
- Yep.

07:28.170 --> 07:30.036
You're looking at Albuquerque's newest

07:30.072 --> 07:31.905
mobile communications specialist.

07:31.940 --> 07:33.806
I'm a shift supervisor, even.

07:33.842 --> 07:35.976
Be very impressed.

07:36.011 --> 07:39.012
Cellphone sales.
I-I'm selling cellphones.

07:39.047 --> 07:40.747
CC Mobile. I start today.

07:40.782 --> 07:44.817
- Jimmy, that... that is great.
- Yeah.

07:44.853 --> 07:46.719
It's strictly gainful employment,

07:46.755 --> 07:50.690
and then 10 months from now...
poof! I'm a lawyer again.

07:50.725 --> 07:52.610
All right.

07:53.461 --> 07:56.829
But you'll just give him a call
when you get a chance?

07:56.865 --> 07:59.332
Of course. Absolutely.

07:59.368 --> 08:02.102
Okay. Coffee's on.

08:02.137 --> 08:05.571
Have a good first day.

08:05.607 --> 08:07.707
You can count on it!

08:19.807 --> 08:21.453
Mr. Finn, James McGill.

08:21.488 --> 08:23.522
Listen, I've been thinking
it over, and I just can't

08:23.557 --> 08:27.192
pass up this opportunity...
if the position is still open?

08:39.506 --> 08:41.072
- Hey, Marty.
- Morning, Kim.

08:41.107 --> 08:42.173
What's on for today?

08:42.207 --> 08:44.008
Well, let's see.

08:44.044 --> 08:46.811
Papadoumian has settlement
conferences most of the morning.

08:46.846 --> 08:50.481
Judge Clark has a pair
of corporate bankruptcies.

08:50.516 --> 08:53.484
Munsinger looks
like criminal trespassing,

08:53.519 --> 08:56.487
aggravated stalking,
and some pleading down.

08:56.522 --> 08:58.122
Okay. Thanks.

08:58.158 --> 08:59.523
You got it.

08:59.559 --> 09:01.192
And you'll have another 14 days

09:01.227 --> 09:03.627
from when they file
to tell me if you want to amend

09:03.663 --> 09:05.496
your request for a pre-trial conference

09:05.531 --> 09:07.265
or keep it the way it is.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.767
I-I gather you're planning to amend, yes?

09:09.802 --> 09:11.502
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Fine.

09:11.537 --> 09:13.371
We'll reconvene in 30 days

09:13.406 --> 09:16.774
for a proper pre-trial
conference, shall we?

09:16.809 --> 09:18.609
I'll have an order out tomorrow.

09:20.646 --> 09:22.279
Okay. Next.

09:22.314 --> 09:29.653
CR2003114576, State vs. Scotty Blakey.

09:30.517 --> 09:32.490
Uh, Ms. Wexler,

09:32.525 --> 09:34.492
do you have a matter
before the court today?

09:34.527 --> 09:36.627
No, Your Honor. Just observing.

09:38.263 --> 09:39.730
All right.

09:39.765 --> 09:40.831
Uh, counsel?

09:40.867 --> 09:42.199
Good morning, Your Honor.

09:42.234 --> 09:44.602
Crystal Eitzmann on behalf of the State.

09:47.907 --> 09:48.973
It's your turn.

09:49.008 --> 09:50.673
Oh, okay.

09:50.709 --> 09:54.044
I'm Scotty Blakey, here for myself.

09:54.079 --> 09:55.912
Mr. Blakey, you're here right now

09:55.947 --> 09:58.181
because I called this case last
week and you didn't show up...

09:58.217 --> 09:59.549
hence, the bench warrant.

09:59.584 --> 10:02.185
- Understood?
- Yes.

10:02.718 --> 10:04.421
Your Honor, Mr. Blakey was given

10:04.456 --> 10:06.490
a six-month suspended sentence,

10:06.525 --> 10:08.425
along with the one-year provision.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.193
There's no question
that this bench warrant

10:10.229 --> 10:12.996
constitutes a clear violation
of a very generous deal.

10:13.032 --> 10:15.032
I'm doing the community service.

10:15.067 --> 10:16.400
- The deadline already passed.
- Judge Munsinger would like

10:16.435 --> 10:18.335
to see you in chambers
at the next recess.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.011
Why do you think you
were summoned in the first place?

10:20.046 --> 10:21.838
The State was prepared
to charge this case as a felony

10:21.873 --> 10:23.507
and agreed to drop it to a misdemeanor

10:23.542 --> 10:25.107
in order to avoid wasting

10:25.143 --> 10:27.470
the court's time and resources.
It's a sha...

10:29.948 --> 10:31.581
In!

10:33.484 --> 10:36.586
Oh, I don't want to bother you
while you're eating.

10:36.621 --> 10:39.589
Sit! Help me take my mind off this.

10:39.624 --> 10:41.772
Eggplant and okra.

10:42.460 --> 10:46.262
My wife insists.
Cholesterol, yadda yadda.

10:55.339 --> 10:56.806
Hurt your arm, huh?

10:56.841 --> 10:58.176
Yes.

10:58.676 --> 11:00.542
Are you researching something?

11:00.578 --> 11:02.208
No, Your Honor.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.713
Then you're... you're working
on your procedure.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.715
Just... observing.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.316
Mm.

11:08.351 --> 11:10.886
Oh, so, Howard Hamlin's fine
with one of his associates

11:10.921 --> 11:12.788
just sitting around my court all day,

11:12.823 --> 11:14.489
whiling away the billable hours?

11:14.524 --> 11:16.291
Actually, I left HHM.

11:16.326 --> 11:18.961
- I'm a solo practitioner now.
- No kidding.

11:18.996 --> 11:20.629
Field?

11:20.664 --> 11:22.678
Mainly banking.

11:24.001 --> 11:25.233
How's business?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.568
Pretty good.

11:26.604 --> 11:28.670
I'm outside counsel for Mesa Verde.

11:28.706 --> 11:30.119
Mesa Verde.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.780
You know, I... I heard about a case,

11:39.816 --> 11:43.117
and I think you might
be the right person for it.

11:43.152 --> 11:44.251
Interested?

11:44.286 --> 11:46.353
Uh, of course.

11:46.388 --> 11:48.155
I can't share all the details just yet,

11:48.190 --> 11:50.957
but I can give ya broad strokes.

11:52.453 --> 11:55.763
There's a young woman, early 20s,

11:55.798 --> 11:59.700
pregnant with her first child,
nearing the end of term.

11:59.736 --> 12:01.356
Healthy as a horse.

12:02.005 --> 12:03.704
She develops a complication.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.973
She goes to the hospital for delivery,

12:06.009 --> 12:09.143
and there's a mistake
with the anesthesia.

12:09.178 --> 12:12.212
She aspirates vomitus
into her oxygen mask,

12:12.248 --> 12:13.847
stops breathing.

12:13.882 --> 12:17.050
The baby's delivered... fine.

12:17.085 --> 12:20.120
But the young mother suffers
serious brain damage.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.889
She's left comatose on a respirator.

12:22.924 --> 12:25.692
The family is naturally devastated.

12:25.727 --> 12:27.863
And they're broke,
so they have no way to pay

12:27.898 --> 12:29.553
for the young lady's care.

12:29.931 --> 12:31.731
And to make matters worse,

12:31.767 --> 12:34.468
the hospital refuses
to take responsibility.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.002
And they've hired

12:36.038 --> 12:38.872
one of the most expensive
firms in the state.

12:39.741 --> 12:41.708
This is the plot of "The Verdict."

12:41.743 --> 12:43.743
Yes! Of course it is!

12:43.779 --> 12:45.979
Because movies are the only place

12:46.014 --> 12:48.314
where those
once-in-a-lifetime cases exist.

12:48.349 --> 12:49.707
You know what I got coming up next?

12:49.742 --> 12:53.086
I got a janitor who threw
his pee on his boss.

12:53.121 --> 12:54.645
The one after that,

12:55.190 --> 12:58.524
she stabbed her boyfriend
over a grilled cheese sandwich.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.227
This is the real world,
Ms. Wexler, and you won't find

13:01.262 --> 13:04.030
any save-the-broken-lawyer cases in it.

13:04.066 --> 13:05.865
Don't think that you are the first

13:05.901 --> 13:08.768
to try to rediscover their love
of the law by trolling my court.

13:08.804 --> 13:10.305
You're not.

13:11.406 --> 13:14.207
Best thing you can do
is stick to Mesa Verde.

13:14.242 --> 13:15.508
Make lots of money.

13:15.543 --> 13:17.510
Give some to charity.

13:19.146 --> 13:23.182
And having said, that we've got
perpetual PD overload.

13:23.218 --> 13:24.883
So beware.

13:24.919 --> 13:27.119
Next time I see you lurking in my court,

13:27.154 --> 13:28.831
I'm gonna put you to work.

13:29.657 --> 13:31.118
Understood.

13:32.414 --> 13:34.026
Good luck to you.

13:35.563 --> 13:39.232
Thank you... Your Honor.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.003
All rise.

13:49.344 --> 13:51.443
Uh, good afternoon. Please be seated.

13:51.478 --> 13:57.382
Case CR2003114882,
State vs. Lester Downes.

13:57.417 --> 13:59.618
You wanted to discuss
the conflict of interest.

13:59.653 --> 14:01.553
Yeah, before we get started, I'll, uh...

14:01.588 --> 14:04.256
I'll address the defense's motion

14:04.291 --> 14:06.625
to disqualify opposing counsel.

14:13.467 --> 14:16.883
Well, I read your brief
very carefully, but I'm not...

14:34.402 --> 14:36.001
Order's up.

14:48.269 --> 14:50.570
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

14:54.075 --> 14:55.805
- Paper?
- Thank you.

15:02.617 --> 15:05.217
22 across is "Esmeralda."

15:07.956 --> 15:09.354
"Bill ringer's love interest."

15:09.390 --> 15:10.723
It's the Hunchback.

15:10.758 --> 15:13.225
Oh, Quasimodo. Look at you.

15:15.429 --> 15:17.362
- Hey, Anita.
- Hey, Fran.

15:17.398 --> 15:18.764
Usual for you?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.199
Yep. Thanks.

15:20.234 --> 15:21.366
Yeah. Thank you, Fran.

15:21.402 --> 15:23.434
You're welcome.

15:25.371 --> 15:27.171
You know, a girlfriend of mine

15:27.207 --> 15:31.042
is playing piano with her band
tonight at The Launchpad.

15:31.078 --> 15:34.412
They're pretty good. You wanna go?

15:34.447 --> 15:36.180
Tonight's group.

15:36.216 --> 15:37.862
Mm, we could ditch.

15:38.986 --> 15:40.418
I'd better go.

15:40.453 --> 15:42.787
I told Stacey I'd be there.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.590
Sure.

15:47.260 --> 15:49.460
Maybe I could stop by after.

15:49.496 --> 15:51.362
That'd be great.

15:55.669 --> 15:58.202
You know, speaking of group,

15:58.238 --> 16:00.544
I've been thinking
about reaching out to Henry.

16:01.007 --> 16:02.572
I think he needs a friend.

16:02.608 --> 16:05.042
Every time I see him, he seems worse.

16:05.077 --> 16:06.977
Henry's fine.

16:07.013 --> 16:09.246
- You talked to him?
- Don't need to.

16:09.281 --> 16:11.248
Then how do you know?

16:12.685 --> 16:14.785
Because that dead wife
he's always talking about

16:14.820 --> 16:16.453
never existed.

16:18.423 --> 16:20.024
What are you talking about?

16:20.059 --> 16:21.687
It's an act.

16:22.911 --> 16:24.796
Why would you even say that?

16:24.831 --> 16:27.965
The guy's story changes
every time he tells it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.700
Really?

16:29.735 --> 16:31.174
No, I don't think so.

16:31.209 --> 16:34.504
That romantic night at the
Cubs game, their first kiss?

16:34.540 --> 16:36.005
- Yeah?
- Never happened.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.007
You can't know that.

16:38.043 --> 16:40.877
Wrigley Field didn't get lights
until '88.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.680
There were no night games before then.

16:43.715 --> 16:45.879
None of his details add up.

16:46.757 --> 16:49.090
Well, maybe he just got the year wrong.

16:52.776 --> 16:55.376
Why would anyone
make up a story like that?

16:55.401 --> 16:56.738
Okay.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.070
Here you go.

16:59.998 --> 17:01.030
Enjoy.

17:01.066 --> 17:03.028
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Fran.

17:05.852 --> 17:07.155
You know...

17:08.021 --> 17:10.954
you have a very suspicious nature.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.498
Hmm.

17:15.227 --> 17:16.894
Watch him.

17:16.929 --> 17:18.962
He's got a tell.

17:18.998 --> 17:22.132
Like a bad poker player, when he's lying,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.667
he rubs his wrist.

17:25.523 --> 17:27.195
Okay.

17:28.774 --> 17:30.908
You want to put your money
where your mouth is?

17:30.943 --> 17:33.091
Well, you gonna come to group tonight?

17:33.612 --> 17:35.478
Make it interesting.

17:37.249 --> 17:39.049
All right.

17:39.084 --> 17:44.606
10 bucks says that when he talks
about Judy, different story.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.156
All right. You're on.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.625
All right.

19:03.466 --> 19:05.133
CC Mobile. This is Jimmy.

19:05.168 --> 19:07.502
Hey-o. How was the first morning?

19:07.537 --> 19:09.170
Good, Robbie.

19:09.205 --> 19:11.805
Um... well ya, actually,

19:11.841 --> 19:14.742
it's a little... little slow.

19:14.777 --> 19:16.777
Yeah, that store's always
been a bit calmer.

19:16.812 --> 19:18.078
Just bring a book.

19:18.114 --> 19:19.947
So, this is a normal weekday?

19:19.982 --> 19:21.915
Mostly, but wait till inventory week.

19:21.951 --> 19:23.751
There's a line out the door.

19:23.786 --> 19:25.520
When's inventory week?

19:25.555 --> 19:28.656
Uh, you just missed it.

19:28.691 --> 19:32.459
Is there, uh, any chance
that you could move me

19:32.494 --> 19:34.827
to a store with a little more traffic?

19:34.863 --> 19:36.363
Uh, let's see.

19:36.398 --> 19:38.797
The Gold Street store is always hoppin'.

19:39.301 --> 19:41.934
Uh, but it looks like the
schedule's all full right now.

19:41.970 --> 19:43.970
Let's give it a couple weeks,
and then we'll see.

19:44.005 --> 19:45.805
Uh, no problem.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.140
If I can, I'll swing by later.

19:47.176 --> 19:48.341
Keep up the good work.

19:48.377 --> 19:50.544
Yeah. See you then. Bye.

20:43.531 --> 20:47.032
Hmm.

20:56.544 --> 21:00.011
_

21:02.750 --> 21:05.500
_

21:06.098 --> 21:10.731
_

21:11.091 --> 21:15.961
_

21:17.297 --> 21:19.281
_

21:19.914 --> 21:21.914
_

21:40.420 --> 21:42.298
Hey, amigos.

22:01.207 --> 22:03.808
- Aah!
- Ugh!

22:24.662 --> 22:26.629
Salamancas.

24:50.773 --> 24:53.216
_

24:53.256 --> 24:56.185
_

25:00.849 --> 25:02.247
Ugh!

25:11.359 --> 25:14.426
_

27:37.419 --> 27:39.762
We cleared out the Espinosas.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.116
They're all done.

27:42.706 --> 27:44.608
And the Salamanca brothers?

27:45.875 --> 27:49.480
Marco took a hit, but he'll pull through.

27:50.729 --> 27:53.117
They went back south
until the heat dies down.

27:56.923 --> 27:59.256
It's territory, isn't it?

28:00.493 --> 28:04.128
Salamancas wipe out the Espinosas.

28:04.163 --> 28:07.665
Espinosa territory is up for grabs.

28:07.701 --> 28:10.100
The cartel
can't give it to the Salamancas,

28:10.136 --> 28:14.917
so... I think they give it to you.

28:28.721 --> 28:30.771
Get some rest.

28:31.623 --> 28:33.757
You have more to do.

28:43.736 --> 28:45.502
It's a service to the people.

28:45.537 --> 28:48.339
It really is. It's a nonprofit.

28:48.374 --> 28:50.374
And it's a perfect fit, I mean,

28:50.409 --> 28:53.277
what with his degree
in sociology and all.

28:53.312 --> 28:55.946
I think he's really come a long way.

28:55.982 --> 28:58.215
It... He hasn't even talked

28:58.251 --> 29:00.450
about getting a job until this week.

29:00.486 --> 29:02.853
The place is called the...

29:03.496 --> 29:04.688
Whoops.

29:04.723 --> 29:07.023
Sorry. Sorry.

29:08.994 --> 29:11.961
Willa, you hadn't quite finished.

29:11.997 --> 29:14.330
It's called the North Fourth Art Center.

29:14.366 --> 29:16.466
I hope he takes the job.

29:16.502 --> 29:17.834
Well, thank you, Willa.

29:17.870 --> 29:20.798
That all sounds really promising.

29:22.110 --> 29:24.173
Anyone else?

29:28.680 --> 29:30.680
Stacey.

29:30.716 --> 29:32.815
Um... today,

29:32.850 --> 29:34.983
I-I got up, and I took a shower.

29:35.282 --> 29:36.514
Kaylee woke up on her own

29:36.550 --> 29:38.183
and got herself ready for school.

29:38.218 --> 29:40.152
It was just a regular morning.

29:40.187 --> 29:42.287
I made French toast for breakfast,

29:42.322 --> 29:45.691
and we talked about
the self-pasting toothbrush

29:45.726 --> 29:48.259
she's making for the science fair.

29:48.295 --> 29:51.262
I took her to school and went to work.

29:51.298 --> 29:53.369
And then I realized it.

29:53.901 --> 29:56.808
I don't know why
I noticed it just then, but...

29:57.905 --> 30:00.779
I hadn't thought about Matty
all morning...

30:02.209 --> 30:03.942
not once.

30:06.379 --> 30:08.045
When I was making French toast,

30:08.081 --> 30:11.296
why didn't I remember
that I-it's his favorite?

30:11.984 --> 30:14.785
I think about Matty every single
time I make breakfast,

30:14.821 --> 30:16.664
but not today.

30:18.224 --> 30:20.428
And they weren't just minutes.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.820
There were hours
that I didn't think about him.

30:24.731 --> 30:27.064
And if I can go hours, then...

30:27.100 --> 30:29.533
then... then why not a whole day?

30:29.568 --> 30:31.635
Why not a whole week?

30:31.670 --> 30:34.839
I mean, what if
I lose the sound of his voice?

30:34.874 --> 30:38.209
What if I forget him completely?

30:38.244 --> 30:39.509
I mean, I know I won't.

30:39.545 --> 30:42.179
That's, like, impossible, but...

30:44.716 --> 30:47.958
I don't know. I'm just... I don't know.

30:49.020 --> 30:53.266
Thank you, Stacey.
You're not alone, truly.

30:53.291 --> 30:55.491
And it might be painful,

30:55.526 --> 30:59.328
but if... if you ask me,
I'd say it's progress.

30:59.364 --> 31:02.698
I mean... a lot of us in this room

31:02.734 --> 31:05.668
have felt the same things
you're talking about.

31:08.439 --> 31:10.211
I know I have.

31:14.980 --> 31:16.512
I keep trying to get there,

31:16.547 --> 31:20.816
you know, to live in the here and now.

31:22.553 --> 31:27.590
I know that's what Judy would
have wanted, but it's... hard.

31:28.959 --> 31:33.763
This guy at work... I've been
avoiding him for the last two weeks,

31:33.798 --> 31:37.733
ever since he got back from his
vacation to Australia.

31:39.937 --> 31:42.405
She always wanted to go to Sydney,

31:42.440 --> 31:45.135
but money was tight.

31:45.843 --> 31:49.812
Finally, we were gonna go, for our 25th,

31:49.847 --> 31:53.315
and that's when she got her test results.

31:53.350 --> 31:55.658
Ugh, God.

31:56.486 --> 31:58.954
Mike, you have something you want to add?

31:59.852 --> 32:02.482
You don't want to hear
what I have to say.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.561
Well, we're ready if you are.

32:06.596 --> 32:08.130
Yeah?

32:08.165 --> 32:11.060
This guy was never married.

32:13.304 --> 32:14.769
What are you talking about?

32:14.805 --> 32:16.305
Mike, now, you know the rules.

32:16.340 --> 32:18.173
Yeah, I know your rules.

32:18.209 --> 32:20.075
He's been coming in here for months

32:20.110 --> 32:21.810
selling you a bill of goods,

32:21.846 --> 32:24.579
getting you all misty-eyed
and loving every minute of it.

32:24.614 --> 32:26.348
- Pop...
- Stop.

32:26.383 --> 32:28.316
That's just not true.

32:28.352 --> 32:30.017
Yeah? Okay.

32:30.053 --> 32:32.454
So, I'll go to the public library

32:32.489 --> 32:34.856
and I'll get the papers from 1997

32:34.891 --> 32:37.124
and I'll run a search on Judy DeVore,

32:37.160 --> 32:39.293
beloved wife of Henry DeVore.

32:39.329 --> 32:41.596
Tell me I'll find her obituary.

32:41.631 --> 32:44.499
She wanted to go to Australia?

32:44.534 --> 32:46.785
Well, last month, it was Cuba.

32:47.571 --> 32:49.537
Come on, Henry.

32:49.573 --> 32:51.673
Let's look at the papers,
see if the math works.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.140
Come on. Mike.

32:56.580 --> 32:58.880
She's not there, is she?

33:03.103 --> 33:05.218
Go on. Say it.

33:05.968 --> 33:08.206
You have no shame.

33:22.204 --> 33:23.744
Well...

33:24.573 --> 33:27.446
he came to the right place, didn't he?

33:28.010 --> 33:30.238
He knew you wouldn't notice.

33:30.679 --> 33:32.599
And you didn't.

33:33.916 --> 33:36.682
All wrapped up in your sad,
little stories,

33:36.718 --> 33:39.685
feeding off each other's misery.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.810
You wanted me to talk.

33:48.730 --> 33:50.690
I talked.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.003
_

34:44.708 --> 34:46.473
_

34:50.847 --> 34:52.612
_

34:55.585 --> 34:57.910
_

34:57.911 --> 34:59.911
_

35:13.769 --> 35:16.517
_

35:16.518 --> 35:19.320
_

35:22.245 --> 35:23.711
_

35:23.746 --> 35:25.463
Mijo.

35:26.514 --> 35:28.403
_

35:28.438 --> 35:30.883
Papa.

35:32.887 --> 35:34.053
Papa, no.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.388
_

35:35.423 --> 35:36.989
Papa.

35:37.024 --> 35:38.817
_

35:39.083 --> 35:41.003
_

35:41.028 --> 35:42.161
911. What's your emergency?

35:43.798 --> 35:45.511
_

35:45.547 --> 35:47.500
Hello?

35:48.803 --> 35:51.304
911. What's your emergency?

35:58.546 --> 36:00.373
_

36:01.638 --> 36:04.232
_

36:11.759 --> 36:13.091
This one?

36:13.126 --> 36:14.893
Unh-unh.

36:20.601 --> 36:22.033
How about this one?

36:22.068 --> 36:23.597
No.

36:35.482 --> 36:36.615
This one.

36:36.650 --> 36:38.282
Sure thing.

36:38.318 --> 36:41.619
Hernandez and Sullivan.
They led the pack and load.

36:41.654 --> 36:43.788
My top guys.

36:43.823 --> 36:44.988
Mhm-kay.

37:30.635 --> 37:32.411
What's that say?

37:33.705 --> 37:34.847
Uh...

37:34.882 --> 37:36.106
It's not a guessing game.

37:36.687 --> 37:38.798
38 degrees.

37:39.644 --> 37:41.811
Should be 35.

37:41.847 --> 37:43.513
Musta come in set wrong.

37:43.548 --> 37:46.149
Goes out set right.

38:01.399 --> 38:04.348
Manifest doesn't say anything about...

38:05.836 --> 38:08.979
Yeah. We'll fix that.

38:23.421 --> 38:25.561
These okay with you?

38:27.224 --> 38:28.924
Are you talking about the strap?

38:28.959 --> 38:30.848
I am.

38:31.695 --> 38:36.432
Might be a little frayed,
but the rest of them are fine.

38:36.467 --> 38:38.667
And you know this how?

38:40.471 --> 38:43.204
So, we're pulling all the E track straps?

38:43.240 --> 38:45.507
Is that a question?

38:47.377 --> 38:49.141
We'll pull them.

38:49.177 --> 38:51.613
<i>Call for Ehrmantraut.</i>

39:02.459 --> 39:04.392
Ehrmantraut.

39:04.428 --> 39:06.553
He wants to see you.

39:07.690 --> 39:09.197
Yeah?

39:09.232 --> 39:10.897
Tonight.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.715
Hold on. We're not done yet.

40:30.545 --> 40:33.179
I'm a Fanta guy myself.

40:33.214 --> 40:35.848
Yeah, well,

40:35.883 --> 40:37.783
you can buy a truckload.

40:39.587 --> 40:41.220
Here you go.

40:54.068 --> 40:58.737
Hey, whoa. Whoa. This is, uh,
more than we talked about.

40:58.773 --> 41:02.474
Yeah, Bavarian Boy made quite a splash

41:02.509 --> 41:05.010
at the collectibles expo.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.378
Bidding war.

41:06.413 --> 41:08.109
Wow. But great.

41:08.145 --> 41:10.315
We both know you could have
kept most of this.

41:10.350 --> 41:11.917
I-I would have never known
the difference.

41:11.953 --> 41:15.153
Yeah, well, you could have
left me high and dry.

41:15.189 --> 41:17.715
I'm liking this Hummel thing.

41:19.293 --> 41:21.593
The cash came fast and clean.

41:21.628 --> 41:23.428
Got any more where that came from?

41:24.771 --> 41:27.665
Mm. No, not really.

41:27.701 --> 41:30.102
Ah, bummer.

41:32.772 --> 41:34.539
We're gonna do this again.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.907
I'll find something.

41:35.942 --> 41:37.480
Sounds good.

41:38.712 --> 41:40.678
When you do, call the vet.

41:40.714 --> 41:42.013
Yeah?

41:42.048 --> 41:44.649
Yeah. New job new phone.

41:46.886 --> 41:48.920
You never know who's listening.

44:20.696 --> 44:23.070
You want to see me. Here I am.

44:23.105 --> 44:25.606
In order for our arrangement to continue,

44:25.642 --> 44:28.409
there is a matter we need to discuss.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.200
Okay.

44:33.883 --> 44:35.953
Do you have something to tell me?

44:37.787 --> 44:43.090
If you do, you would
be well advised to do so.

44:44.994 --> 44:47.027
Nacho Varga.

44:47.062 --> 44:49.696
I wondered when you were
gonna get around to this.

44:50.305 --> 44:52.483
You came to me.

44:53.977 --> 44:56.403
You asked for a favor.

44:57.024 --> 45:00.740
You looked me in the eye,
you shook my hand,

45:00.776 --> 45:02.642
and all the while, you knew

45:02.678 --> 45:04.912
Varga was moving against my interests.

45:04.947 --> 45:07.281
I said I wouldn't kill Salamanca.

45:07.316 --> 45:10.217
I never promised to be his bodyguard.

45:13.155 --> 45:17.556
So... what now?

45:21.996 --> 45:24.755
You gonna make a move,
you better make it.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.543
But they're not gonna, are they?

45:37.312 --> 45:40.646
You brought me here
because you have an ask.

45:42.317 --> 45:44.416
So, why don't you stop
running a game on me

45:44.452 --> 45:47.079
and just tell me about the job?

45:48.305 --> 45:54.630
