<i>Previously on</i> Vampire Diaries:

00:03.602 --> 00:06.003
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:06.206 --> 00:08.674
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
The key to the curse.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.333
Klaus is a vampire
born from a werewolf bloodline.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.809
The curse kept his werewolf
from manifesting.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.279
He'll be vulnerable during the
transformation, when Bonnie comes in.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.782
If she can deliver him
to the brink of death, I'll finish the job.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.581
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.623
He scattered them
where their bodies could not be found.

00:25.792 --> 00:29.091
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.662
If you kill me, you'll never find them.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.093
No!

00:33.266 --> 00:35.496
Who's gonna save your life
while you're making decisions?

00:35.668 --> 00:37.795
- I don't want to be saved.
- There is a way.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.700
What are you...? Damon, no.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.931
I fed her my blood.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.302
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.103
She'll never forgive you.

00:45.278 --> 00:48.179
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.
- A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.284
That'll get easier.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.913
But you know that.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.559
What do you want?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.189
I wanna apologize.

01:35.361 --> 01:37.829
- Damon...
- Please.

01:38.531 --> 01:41.398
Elena, feeding you my blood,
I was wrong.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.368
Yes, you were.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.535
And I know
I don't deserve your forgiveness...

01:48.808 --> 01:50.799
...but I need it.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.512
And I need some time...

01:54.848 --> 01:56.873
...maybe a lot of time.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.679
Sure. Of course.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.588
Take all the time you need.

03:40.119 --> 03:41.780
Get off of me.

03:42.789 --> 03:43.847
You're not doing this.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.649
Just did.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.724
You know what happened to Rose,
Stefan.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.055
I don't care.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.433
You're not dying today.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.665
What's the plan, Superman?

04:02.041 --> 04:05.704
- I'm gonna find a way out of this.
- Oh, right. A miracle cure.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.311
Good luck with that one.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.971
I got Bonnie looking for something,
anything.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.050
Always the hero, Stefan.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.019
Just tell me goodbye, get it over with.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.021
Lie still. Conserve your strength.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.978
You've been busy.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.719
That was amazing.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.619
How long has it been?

04:56.229 --> 04:57.992
Almost two days.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.628
Full moon came and went.
You remained a wolf.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.099
I can change at will then.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.397
That's good to know.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.369
I remember...

05:08.541 --> 05:10.805
...every single kill.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.807
Yes, I've been cleaning up your mess.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.037
Just like old times, brother.

05:15.214 --> 05:18.012
Well, you've had your fun.
I believe we have a bargain.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.150
That's right.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.413
Now, what was it again?

05:22.588 --> 05:25.079
Oh, yeah, wait. I remember. That's it.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.658
You wish to be reunited
with our family.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.795
You gave me your word, Niklaus.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.931
What kind of brother
would break his bond?

05:33.099 --> 05:35.260
Even though you did try to kill me.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.134
I could have.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.940
But I didn't.

05:44.043 --> 05:48.309
Now no one can, not even you.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.911
Relax, Elijah.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.985
All is forgiven.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.184
Where are they?

05:59.625 --> 06:01.991
You need to lighten up.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.763
I'll bring you to them soon enough.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.972
You've reached somebody
who's currently not operating.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.307
I need your help.

06:22.482 --> 06:25.679
You have me confused with somebody
else. I'm not allowed to help...

06:25.852 --> 06:30.118
...just idly sit by while my girlfriend
gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.154
Damon's dying.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.015
- What?
- <i>Tyler Lockwood bit him.</i>

06:34.193 --> 06:35.956
We don't have much time.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.625
What do you need?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.835
You brought me to see a girl movie.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.038
We had to get out of the house, Jer.

06:56.215 --> 06:58.513
This is our three-hour distraction
from reality.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.881
Is that what we're doing?
Pretending our lives aren't screwed?

07:02.054 --> 07:03.681
We need to do this, okay?

07:04.223 --> 07:08.626
Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up
and do it all over again...

07:08.795 --> 07:13.232
...until one day,
it's just not as hard anymore.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.365
Hey. There you guys are.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.336
- Who's hungry?
- Are we really doing this?

07:21.507 --> 07:23.771
Yes, we are really doing this.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.571
Yeah, we're going to take a page
from Scarlett.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.213
We made it through the war.

07:28.514 --> 07:32.917
I know you guys went through hell,
and my mom knows I am a vampire...

07:33.085 --> 07:35.883
...so basically,
it's like Atlanta has burned.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.923
And yet, in spite of everything,
we persevere.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.730
All right. What are we eating?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.800
Something good.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.874
I'm not sure this is gonna work.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.708
You've done a sÃ©ance before, right?
Contacted Emily Bennett.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.885
Maybe one of the witches know
how to help Damon.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.422
Let's just hope they want to.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.000
Bonnie?

08:32.278 --> 08:33.404
Bonnie?

08:36.414 --> 08:37.780
Emily.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.115
Why have you come here, Stefan?

08:44.490 --> 08:46.617
I need your help.

08:46.826 --> 08:50.660
I need to know if there's a spell
that can heal a werewolf bite.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.763
No. Nature ensures a balance
to everything.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.959
Is that true?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.500
Or are you just saying no
because it's Damon?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.202
Perhaps it is his time to die.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.776
No. That's not balance...

09:05.945 --> 09:07.378
...that's punishment.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.812
I will not give you what you want.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.452
So you're saying
that there's an answer to give?

09:14.620 --> 09:15.814
Please.

09:16.455 --> 09:19.356
If you know something, just tell me.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.522
Help me save my brother.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.563
Bonnie.

09:28.768 --> 09:31.669
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.668
They know something.
There's an answer.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.034
- They just don't wanna tell me.
- Yeah.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.172
I heard them say a name.

09:39.712 --> 09:40.838
What was it?

09:41.881 --> 09:43.075
Klaus.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.755
Carol, hi. How you feeling?

09:56.929 --> 09:59.295
Better, thank goodness.
It was a terrible fall.

09:59.465 --> 10:00.659
Shouldn't you be resting?

10:00.833 --> 10:02.960
I've been resting.
Now I'm ready to work.

10:03.135 --> 10:06.127
Update me on where we are
with the vampire situation.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.802
Well, there's been some developments,
but I'm handling it.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.204
Are you?

10:11.377 --> 10:15.177
I left you in charge of this town's safety
and I'm not seeing any results.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.508
I said, I'm handling it.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.206
Then see that you do, sheriff...

10:18.384 --> 10:21.080
...because if you can't,
I'll find someone who will.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.391
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:26.993 --> 10:30.156
Look who couldn't resist
an epic romance.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.695
Will you come take a walk with me?

10:33.032 --> 10:34.795
You're breaking the rules, you know.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.197
Movie night's supposed to be
a distraction.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.134
Tomorrow we can return
to our regularly-scheduled drama.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.866
I know, I wish this could wait,
but it can't.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.308
Listen, um...

10:46.479 --> 10:50.643
...the other night when Damon
was helping Tyler, something happened.

10:50.816 --> 10:55.048
Tyler was starting to transform
and Damon was bitten.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.384
What?

10:58.624 --> 11:00.216
Is it...? Is he gonna...?

11:00.626 --> 11:02.526
Yeah.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.923
Oh, my God.

11:07.366 --> 11:11.200
He came to the house this morning
and tried to apologize.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.395
I practically slammed the door
in his face.

11:13.572 --> 11:17.269
He told me not to tell you, but I figured
if you wanted to talk to him...

11:17.443 --> 11:19.138
I wouldn't wait.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.206
- Stefan...
- It's not over.

11:22.381 --> 11:23.643
There might be a cure.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.744
- But I have to find Klaus to get it.
- No, he's gonna kill you.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.218
No, he had the chance to kill me,
but he didn't.

11:31.023 --> 11:35.050
Whatever Damon's done,
whatever's led him here...

11:35.761 --> 11:39.094
...I'm the one that made him
become a vampire in the first place.

11:39.265 --> 11:44.259
So if there's a chance for a cure,
I owe it to him to find it.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.669
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.

12:10.596 --> 12:14.965
Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady
is a sign of very poor manners.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.637
My apologies, Miss Katherine.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.804
But since you are here...

12:22.975 --> 12:25.102
...my corset strings seem
to be knotted.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.438
I wonder if you can undo them.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.444
Of course.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.461
Will you miss me
while off defending the South?

12:44.630 --> 12:47.827
- I shall.
- Then I hope you will hurry back.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.992
I fear I will be Ionely with you away.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.867
I would think Stefan
should be company enough.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.672
Is it so wrong for me
to want you both?

12:59.845 --> 13:01.506
Damon.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.543
- Elena?
- Don't you see?

13:05.151 --> 13:06.618
She was toying with you.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.483
All you had to do was say no,
walk away.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.884
You had a choice.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.389
Promise me
that you will return quickly.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.018
I promise.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.344
- Hello, Katherine.
- Two days, I've been waiting.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.008
I'm supposed to be free
of Klaus' compulsion by now.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.849
- He's supposed to be dead.
- We ran into complications.

13:44.023 --> 13:45.923
- Complications?
- Doesn't really matter.

13:46.091 --> 13:49.185
I just need to find him. Do you have
any idea where he might be?

13:51.730 --> 13:54.028
Klaus, you're back.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.895
Look who decided to come for a visit.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.737
You just keep popping up, don't you?

14:02.241 --> 14:03.401
I need your help.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.175
For my brother.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.108
Whatever it is,
is gonna have to wait.

14:08.447 --> 14:11.439
You see,
I have an obligation to my brother...

14:11.617 --> 14:14.848
...that requires
my immediate attention.

14:18.057 --> 14:21.083
You understand how important family is
or you wouldn't be here.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.423
My brother gave me his word
that he would reunite me with my own.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.258
And so I shall.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.570
Shh.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.657
Now, what am I gonna do with you?

15:05.638 --> 15:09.165
Do you feel that?
It's scraping against your heart.

15:09.375 --> 15:13.641
The slightest little movement
and you're dead.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.645
He's just trying to help his brother.

15:18.817 --> 15:21.012
The witches said you had a cure.

15:21.186 --> 15:25.680
Make me a deal. Just give me the cure
and I'll do whatever you want.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.601
Trouble is I don't know
if you'd be any good to me...

15:37.770 --> 15:39.169
...the way you are now.

15:39.905 --> 15:45.309
You're just shy of useless.

15:50.549 --> 15:53.985
- Well, that looks bad.
- It feels worse.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.714
My subconscious is haunting me, Ric.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.420
Please tell me
you have something for that. Heh.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.563
Double shot.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.566
That's good.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.933
Oh, good.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.746
So my brother sent you
for suicide watch?

16:21.947 --> 16:23.744
He's just trying to help.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.210
He's doing what he always does...

16:26.852 --> 16:30.185
...trying to right the wrongs
of the past. Ugh.

16:32.825 --> 16:37.159
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.759
- I don't blame you for Jenna.
- Oh, sure you do.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.464
Let's not forget
I turned your wife into a vampire.

16:47.639 --> 16:51.075
- You must really hate me for that one.
- Okay, give me your glass.

16:51.243 --> 16:55.009
Neither one of us is drunk enough
for this conversation.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.351
Kill me. Please.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.086
Screw you.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.429
No.

17:16.902 --> 17:18.130
Elena?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.432
Elena's not here, Damon.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.720
Don't make a sound.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.286
I need blood.

17:46.298 --> 17:47.925
I need blood.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.040
Where's Damon?

17:57.476 --> 17:59.774
Now's not a good time, sheriff.
Trust me.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.243
- Sheriff, over here.
- I wouldn't go in there.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.247
- I just wanna talk to him.
- I wouldn't go in there.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.162
Liz.

18:26.638 --> 18:30.301
All this waiting around for
news is ruining Scarlett for me.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.212
- Alaric, hey.
- Tell me you're with Elena.

18:36.381 --> 18:39.214
She went to see Damon,
I thought that's where you were.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.080
He escaped. He's looking for her.
The cops are after him.

18:42.287 --> 18:47.384
He's in bad shape. If you find her get her
somewhere safe, okay? I'm on my way.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.655
If Damon is off the rails,
there is nothing you can do to stop him.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.060
- Let us take care of it.
- You keep doing this.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.895
You left me behind before
and Jenna still died.

18:57.402 --> 19:00.667
Now, I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and try to stop me.

19:11.717 --> 19:16.086
I heard about this one vampire,
crazy bloke...

19:16.255 --> 19:19.315
...always on and off the wagon
for decades.

19:19.491 --> 19:24.952
When he was off, he was magnificent.

19:26.131 --> 19:32.070
1917, he went into Monterey
and wiped out an entire migrant village.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.137
A true ripper.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.906
Sound familiar?

19:43.115 --> 19:45.845
I haven't been that way
in a very long time.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.646
Well, that's the vampire
I can make a deal with.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.290
That is the kind of talent...

19:52.457 --> 19:54.755
...that I can use
when I leave this town.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.563
Katerina, come here.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.073
No.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.609
No.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.610
No. No, no.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.530
You want your cure?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.392
There it is.

20:42.274 --> 20:43.707
Your blood is the cure.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.701
Gotta love Mother Nature.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.644
Now...

20:50.182 --> 20:53.811
...let's talk, you and I.

21:14.306 --> 21:15.500
Katherine?

21:15.674 --> 21:17.505
Damon.

21:20.746 --> 21:23.010
Where's Elena?
I need to see Elena now.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.513
Hey, let's get you out of here first,
all right?

21:25.684 --> 21:27.049
Hey.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.987
Where's Damon?
What have you done to him?

21:34.159 --> 21:37.890
Why do you even care?
You know what they are, what they do.

21:38.063 --> 21:40.395
I understand why you hate them,
but you're wrong.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.726
They're murderers, Elena. End of story.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.264
Damon Salvatore
was spotted outside entering the Grill.

21:47.472 --> 21:52.466
Wait. You gotta let me come with you.
He's sick. He's... He's not himself.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.669
Keep her here.

22:00.419 --> 22:02.250
Hey, it's me.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.852
I'm with Damon at the Grill.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.024
Oh, God.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.022
Oh, my God.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.129
I've got a gunshot victim at the Grill.
Get paramedics.

22:19.304 --> 22:20.896
You're gonna be fine.

22:22.574 --> 22:23.939
- Jeremy.
- It's gonna be okay.

22:24.109 --> 22:25.440
What did you do?

22:25.610 --> 22:27.100
I was aiming for Damon.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.271
- He still has his ring.
- She's human. The ring won't work.

22:30.449 --> 22:31.780
- Caroline...
- I got it.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.791
Come on, Jeremy. Just drink.
Jeremy, drink.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.587
- What are you doing?
- Helping him.

22:43.762 --> 22:46.925
- Jeremy, drink.
- Please. Please.

22:58.541 --> 22:59.769
Bonnie, what's going on?

23:03.012 --> 23:04.570
Oh, my God.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.506
I know what I need to do.

23:08.684 --> 23:09.878
I need you to grab him.

23:10.653 --> 23:13.121
- Take him with us.
- No, no, no, you can't move him.

23:13.289 --> 23:15.382
- This is a crime scene.
- Mom, let them go.

23:17.159 --> 23:21.892
Okay. All right. Come here, buddy.
I got you. I got you.

23:47.656 --> 23:48.987
There it is.

23:50.759 --> 23:53.091
You wanna save your brother?

23:53.262 --> 23:56.425
How about a decade-Iong bender?

24:00.369 --> 24:02.360
You know I have big plans for you...

24:02.571 --> 24:04.198
...when we leave this town.

24:04.974 --> 24:06.669
I'm not like that anymore.

24:08.310 --> 24:09.572
Well, that's too bad.

24:10.379 --> 24:13.212
You would have made a hell
of a wingman.

24:15.217 --> 24:16.275
Wait.

24:18.487 --> 24:20.387
Now, that's more like it.

24:21.657 --> 24:24.125
I want you to join me for a drink.

24:45.514 --> 24:46.708
Finish it.

24:48.417 --> 24:50.510
All of it.

24:54.623 --> 24:58.889
You do everything I say
and I save your brother. That's the deal.

25:28.057 --> 25:30.025
Again.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.475
Is this even possible?

25:51.680 --> 25:54.911
There's a spell for it
if they'll give me the power to use it.

26:11.934 --> 26:13.925
- No.
- What? What is it?

26:14.103 --> 26:16.594
They're angry at me
for coming back here.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.067
They don't wanna help.

26:22.111 --> 26:24.944
- Well, they have to.
- They said there will be consequences.

26:25.114 --> 26:28.106
Well, he's just a kid.
Tell them to shut up.

26:54.343 --> 26:57.335
Emily. Emily.

26:59.682 --> 27:02.116
I know you're there.

27:03.986 --> 27:06.011
Please help me.

27:10.859 --> 27:13.259
I love him.

27:20.636 --> 27:22.627
No.

27:38.654 --> 27:40.679
- Oh, my God.
- Bonnie?

27:42.057 --> 27:44.389
Oh, my God, Jeremy.

27:45.894 --> 27:47.828
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

27:49.198 --> 27:50.597
What happened?

27:51.734 --> 27:53.702
Doesn't matter.

27:54.403 --> 27:56.166
You're okay.

27:57.573 --> 27:58.870
You're okay.

28:00.342 --> 28:01.934
Thank you.

28:07.449 --> 28:09.041
<i>- Much for the Yankees to take.</i>

28:09.218 --> 28:12.881
<i>We'll have to make a dash for it</i>
<i>before the fire reaches that ammunition.</i>

28:20.329 --> 28:22.229
Elena.

28:23.198 --> 28:26.964
Damon. Come on. We have to get you
out of here. We have to hide you.

28:27.136 --> 28:29.366
- Where are we going?
- Everywhere.

28:29.538 --> 28:32.268
Wait for me. I wanna come with you.

28:33.575 --> 28:35.475
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.336
- Relax.
- We need to get you out of here.

28:41.216 --> 28:43.912
- You're faster than I thought.
- Why must you always run?

28:44.086 --> 28:45.576
Because I know you will chase.

28:45.988 --> 28:47.785
Then let me chase you forever.

28:48.257 --> 28:50.782
Will you feed me your blood?

28:51.126 --> 28:54.152
I will not feed you, Damon.

28:54.596 --> 28:57.622
If you want it, take it.

29:00.502 --> 29:02.402
It is your choice to make.

29:02.805 --> 29:04.295
I choose you, Katherine.

29:04.473 --> 29:06.373
Look at me. Hey. It's Elena.

29:06.975 --> 29:08.374
It's Elena.

29:08.544 --> 29:11.638
- Promise me you will not tell my brother.
- I promise.

29:12.981 --> 29:14.881
It will be our little secret.

29:16.652 --> 29:19.485
No. Damon. No.

29:19.655 --> 29:23.751
I have to,
if we are to be together forever.

29:26.995 --> 29:29.896
Damon, stop. You're hurting me.

29:30.065 --> 29:32.795
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.

29:32.968 --> 29:34.833
You're hurting me.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.032
Elena.

29:44.112 --> 29:46.410
Damon. Damon.

30:04.066 --> 30:05.192
That was Bonnie.

30:09.404 --> 30:10.996
Jeremy's alive.

30:14.576 --> 30:15.873
I thought I killed him.

30:18.146 --> 30:19.545
You did.

30:21.416 --> 30:23.247
I don't understand.

30:23.719 --> 30:25.380
I explained it to you once.

30:25.787 --> 30:30.383
But I had to make you forget
because I was so scared...

30:30.559 --> 30:32.254
...of what you might do.

30:34.596 --> 30:36.325
But now...

30:37.533 --> 30:38.659
...I don't wanna lie.

30:39.334 --> 30:42.667
I'm not gonna be afraid of you
anymore.

30:44.540 --> 30:49.170
And I don't want you
to be afraid of me anymore.

30:51.046 --> 30:53.446
I'm still your little girl.

30:54.483 --> 30:56.451
It's me.

30:57.085 --> 31:00.248
It's me. Mom?

31:12.935 --> 31:15.062
<i>Hey. What are you doing?</i>

31:15.437 --> 31:19.840
Trying to figure out what's wrong
with me. I feel different, weird.

31:20.008 --> 31:22.636
<i>You were dead.</i>
<i>It would be weird if you felt normal.</i>

31:22.811 --> 31:25.974
<i>Bonnie, I...</i>
<i>I don't know how to thank you.</i>

31:26.148 --> 31:28.514
You can thank me tomorrow.

31:28.884 --> 31:30.351
And the day after that.

31:30.519 --> 31:33.079
<i>And the day after that. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

31:35.724 --> 31:37.851
- <i>Good night, Jeremy.</i>
- Good night.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.691
Hey, bud.

31:47.502 --> 31:50.994
I was gonna take off.
You need anything?

31:51.306 --> 31:55.140
Uh... No, no. I think I'm good.

32:00.682 --> 32:02.741
You know, uh...

32:03.151 --> 32:05.676
...on second thought,
I might crash here. That cool?

32:06.121 --> 32:07.748
Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.

32:07.923 --> 32:09.652
All right.

32:09.858 --> 32:11.325
Alaric, um...

32:14.262 --> 32:16.253
Thank you for everything.

32:16.832 --> 32:18.925
Oh, you can thank me tomorrow.

32:19.501 --> 32:20.695
And the day after that.

32:20.869 --> 32:23.770
- And the day after that.
- Dude, I knew you were listening.

32:24.673 --> 32:26.402
- And the day after that.
- Ha-ha-ha.

32:30.245 --> 32:31.940
Elena.

32:32.147 --> 32:34.240
It's okay, Damon. I'm right here.

32:34.650 --> 32:37.141
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.

32:37.686 --> 32:39.244
No. You won't.

32:40.055 --> 32:42.580
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.

32:42.758 --> 32:45.591
Get out of here.

32:50.265 --> 32:53.598
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

32:54.036 --> 32:57.472
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

32:57.673 --> 33:00.437
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

33:00.609 --> 33:02.873
It's not okay.

33:03.945 --> 33:06.175
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.

33:07.916 --> 33:11.079
No one forced me to love her.

33:12.487 --> 33:14.546
It was my own choice.

33:14.856 --> 33:16.289
Shh.

33:17.092 --> 33:20.061
- I made the wrong choice.
- Hey.

33:25.434 --> 33:27.732
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.

33:28.403 --> 33:30.394
Okay?

33:38.447 --> 33:40.312
I will.

33:53.328 --> 33:55.159
You're very cooperative.

33:55.330 --> 33:58.493
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.737
No more.

34:07.676 --> 34:09.371
Not until you give me the cure.

34:09.543 --> 34:12.877
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.

34:13.047 --> 34:17.109
You can either remain here
living your life in Mystic Falls...

34:17.284 --> 34:22.018
...or you can embrace
what you truly are.

34:22.257 --> 34:25.623
Leave town with me
and save your brother's life.

34:36.304 --> 34:38.329
That's the spirit.

34:40.074 --> 34:41.542
Sweetheart...

34:46.148 --> 34:49.413
...take this over to Damon
and come right back.

34:50.185 --> 34:51.812
- You want me to leave?
- No.

34:52.286 --> 34:53.914
Yes.

34:55.556 --> 34:56.683
And if I were you...

34:58.493 --> 35:00.484
...I'd hurry.

35:03.832 --> 35:05.322
She'll never take it to him.

35:08.804 --> 35:10.362
She'll never take it to him.

35:13.241 --> 35:16.733
This is even more pitiful
than I thought.

35:16.912 --> 35:18.903
There's still hope.

35:21.583 --> 35:24.609
I've made a lot of choices
that have gotten me here.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.211
I deserve this.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.114
I deserve to die.

35:30.325 --> 35:32.316
No.

35:35.363 --> 35:39.265
- You don't.
- I do, Elena. It's okay.

35:40.202 --> 35:44.605
Because if I'd have chosen differently,
I wouldn't have met you.

35:48.944 --> 35:51.344
I'm so sorry.

35:52.581 --> 35:55.049
I've done so many things to hurt you.

35:55.483 --> 35:57.644
It's okay.

35:58.386 --> 35:59.751
I forgive you.

36:00.856 --> 36:03.723
I know you love Stefan.

36:04.426 --> 36:07.293
And it will always be Stefan.

36:13.235 --> 36:15.726
But I love you.

36:18.173 --> 36:20.607
You should know that.

36:27.616 --> 36:29.083
I do.

36:31.286 --> 36:35.245
You should have met me in 1864.

36:37.259 --> 36:38.988
You would have liked me.

36:42.597 --> 36:43.655
I like you now.

36:48.837 --> 36:51.271
Just the way you are.

37:09.190 --> 37:11.488
Thank you.

37:12.193 --> 37:14.184
You're welcome.

37:20.936 --> 37:23.200
Well, it's me you should be thanking.

37:23.705 --> 37:26.799
I mean,
I'm the one who brought the cure.

37:29.044 --> 37:32.070
- I thought you were dead.
- I was.

37:32.981 --> 37:34.642
You got free.

37:34.816 --> 37:37.808
Yep. Finally.

37:39.154 --> 37:41.748
And you still came here?

37:41.957 --> 37:43.891
I owed you one.

37:48.029 --> 37:49.519
Where's Stefan?

37:49.698 --> 37:52.963
- Are you sure you care?
- Where is he?

37:53.768 --> 37:56.862
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.

37:57.672 --> 38:01.335
- I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
- What do you mean "gave himself over"?

38:01.710 --> 38:06.545
He just sacrificed everything
to save his brother, including you.

38:06.715 --> 38:09.206
It's a good thing you have Damon
to keep you company.

38:10.618 --> 38:12.085
Goodbye, Elena.

38:12.821 --> 38:14.152
Oh...

38:15.056 --> 38:16.785
It's okay to love them both.

38:18.693 --> 38:20.558
I did.

38:35.243 --> 38:37.575
I suppose, brother...

38:37.746 --> 38:41.079
...you've been reunited
with our family.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.780
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.

38:52.394 --> 38:53.452
So...

38:56.231 --> 38:58.290
...did Katerina make it in time?

38:58.666 --> 39:01.464
- You won't be seeing her again.
- Because she's on vervain?

39:03.238 --> 39:06.935
I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.

39:07.542 --> 39:11.410
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.

39:16.818 --> 39:18.581
What is it you really want from me?

39:20.455 --> 39:22.753
All will be explained in time.

39:22.924 --> 39:25.051
Once we leave this tragic little town.

39:26.694 --> 39:28.753
Then are we done here?

39:28.997 --> 39:30.965
- Can we go?
- Not quite.

39:31.566 --> 39:34.296
You see, I have a gift for you.

39:35.503 --> 39:36.970
Come here, sweetheart.

39:37.338 --> 39:38.862
Don't be afraid.

39:43.311 --> 39:47.008
See, I wanna make sure
you honor our deal...

39:48.149 --> 39:51.084
...that you'll be of use to me.

39:56.124 --> 40:01.084
I could have compelled her to behave,
but a real ripper...

40:01.262 --> 40:04.197
...enjoys the hunt.

40:32.427 --> 40:34.622
Now we can go.

40:53.381 --> 40:55.144
Alaric?

41:05.927 --> 41:07.792
Alaric.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.223
Jer.

41:41.129 --> 41:43.097
Anna?

41:46.067 --> 41:47.967
Vicki?

41:48.305 --> 41:54.297
