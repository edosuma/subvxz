00:04.338 --> 00:06.757
<i>Not all science
is created equal.</i>

00:06.841 --> 00:09.885
<i>There's physics,
the undisputed king of science.</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:11.721
<i>There's chemistry.
It's no physics,</i>

00:11.804 --> 00:14.265
<i>but it's not a bad way
to pass a rainy afternoon.</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:16.892
<i>And then there's biology,</i>

00:16.976 --> 00:19.020
<i>the squishiest of the sciences.</i>

00:19.103 --> 00:20.396
<i>Ugh!</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:22.773
Once you have deposited
enough saliva

00:22.857 --> 00:25.276
in the blue
Benedict's solution,

00:25.359 --> 00:27.528
we'll mix it in the centrifuge.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.864
After that, we'll pass it
through the spectrometer

00:29.947 --> 00:32.658
to measure
how much glucose is present.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.618
And won't that be a party?

00:34.702 --> 00:35.911
Sheldon.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.638
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.682
It's warm. Oh, dear.

00:57.767 --> 01:00.644
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

01:00.728 --> 01:03.481
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:06.067
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

01:06.150 --> 01:08.402
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

01:08.486 --> 01:12.615
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

01:17.078 --> 01:18.930
And then there was some
extra money in the budget,

01:18.954 --> 01:20.557
so I was able to order
those tackling dummies

01:20.581 --> 01:21.874
I had my eye on.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.043
I don't understand
why the football program gets

01:24.126 --> 01:26.253
so much money while
the equipment in the science lab

01:26.337 --> 01:28.047
is outdated and falling apart.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.298
Oh, I can explain that.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.382
This is Texas.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.426
- Pass the ribs.
- Well, it's not fair.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.594
It's a school.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.304
Education should be
their priority.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.889
All right,
I'll explain it again.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.265
I think Shelly's got a point.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.601
The school is supposed
to prepare these kids

01:40.684 --> 01:42.019
for the future.
How many of 'em

01:42.103 --> 01:44.355
are gonna be
professional football players?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.065
No one at this table.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.734
But how many of 'em
are gonna be scientists?

01:48.818 --> 01:50.444
I know.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.613
George, isn't there a way
they can take some

01:52.696 --> 01:54.615
of the football money
and spend it on science?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.951
Really?
I need to explain it again?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.012
You know, moonpie, in the '60s,
when the hippies wanted

01:59.036 --> 02:01.497
to change things,
they would just protest.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.249
- You were a hippie?
- Oh, no.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.751
But I wrote a letter
complaining about the hippies,

02:05.835 --> 02:07.962
and the police chased 'em
right out of that park.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.089
So my point is...

02:10.172 --> 02:11.412
maybe you could write a letter.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.717
Ooh. Maybe I can lodge
a formal complaint

02:13.801 --> 02:16.053
with the school board
about the sports budget infringing

02:16.137 --> 02:17.304
on the other departments.

02:17.388 --> 02:18.472
Okay, last time:

02:19.140 --> 02:20.266
Canada,

02:20.349 --> 02:21.976
the other states,

02:22.059 --> 02:23.561
us.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.404
What are you doing
standing there?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.739
I wrote a formal complaint letter
to the school board

02:35.823 --> 02:37.950
on how much money
is spent on football.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.869
I was hoping
you could deliver it to them.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.954
You do realize
your father's a coach here.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.330
Yes, sir, I do.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.225
Maybe you ought to talk to him
about this first.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.250
I did.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.169
He didn't care
for the idea at all.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.462
Well, there you go.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.339
There I go what?

02:53.883 --> 02:55.134
Let me see that.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.429
"Barbaric sport...

02:58.512 --> 03:00.181
encourages bloodlust similar

03:00.264 --> 03:02.016
to Roman gladiator games...

03:02.099 --> 03:04.226
Christians, lions...

03:04.310 --> 03:06.770
money better spent
on science and learning."

03:06.854 --> 03:08.355
You're joking, right?

03:08.439 --> 03:10.983
Did you see the word "bazinga"
anywhere in that letter?

03:15.029 --> 03:16.197
Out.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.116
I'll just have to go
over his head.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.413
President Cooper.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.248
That's serendipitous.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.043
Hello.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.587
What?

03:32.213 --> 03:34.506
I understand that you're
in charge of student elections.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.134
I am.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.345
I'd like to run
for class president.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.055
Really?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.514
Really.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.600
Okay.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.144
You can sign up,
but I have to warn you,

03:47.228 --> 03:50.189
you'll be running
against Nell Cavanaugh.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.732
So?

03:51.815 --> 03:54.026
She's well-liked
by the student body.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.109
So?

03:55.152 --> 03:58.530
These elections tend to be
a bit of a popularity contest.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.907
So?

03:59.990 --> 04:01.408
You're gonna make
me say it, huh?

04:01.492 --> 04:02.576
Say what?

04:03.202 --> 04:04.578
People don't like you.

04:04.662 --> 04:07.456
Well, as my meemaw likes to say,
water off a duck's back.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.583
Elections shouldn't be
about popularity.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.877
They should be about who has
the best ideas.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.296
And what's your idea?

04:14.380 --> 04:15.839
Less money on football,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.132
more on science.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.219
Really?

04:20.302 --> 04:22.763
Guess what?
I'm running for class president.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.390
Good for you.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.016
You're encouraging him?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.768
He's gonna get destroyed.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.144
You don't know that.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.938
I feel like I do.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.940
Well, whether you win or not,

04:33.023 --> 04:34.692
I think it's great
that you're trying.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.694
But you think I'll win, right?

04:38.570 --> 04:40.322
God's listening, Mom.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.242
I think it's certainly possible.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.244
Do you have a campaign strategy?

04:45.327 --> 04:47.705
- No.
- Do you have a catchy slogan?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.999
- No.
- Does he have a shot at winning?

04:50.082 --> 04:51.083
No.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.797
Hello. I'd like to speak
to the mayor, please.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.007
My name is Sheldon Cooper.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.466
I'm running for class president

04:59.550 --> 05:02.553
and was hoping
he could give me some advice.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.971
I'm ten years old.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.407
But if it helps get him
on the phone,

05:05.431 --> 05:07.599
I'm well-behaved,
a straight-A student,

05:07.683 --> 05:09.727
and have impeccable hygiene.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.312
Hello.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.563
This is Mayor Harrison.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.190
I understand
you are running for office.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.734
Class president.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.652
Do you have any advice
on how to win?

05:18.736 --> 05:20.738
The most important thing
is to get out there

05:20.821 --> 05:22.573
and connect with people.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.866
<i>That's tricky.</i>

05:23.949 --> 05:25.701
I'm not terribly fond of people.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.995
Well, you might need
to get over that.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.371
Assuming I can,

05:29.455 --> 05:30.748
how do I connect with them?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.958
A friendly handshake
is a great start.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.043
Oh, boy.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.878
Now I have to touch them?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.172
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

05:38.255 --> 05:39.923
<i>I mounted my campaign.</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:42.801
My name is Sheldon Cooper,
and I'm running for class president.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.011
Okay.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.804
Put her there.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.891
Greetings, fellow students.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.768
I'm running for class president.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.895
Here's a button.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.731
Have a grown-up put them on you.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.107
They're sharp.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.360
Hello.
I'm Sheldon Cooper,

05:59.443 --> 06:01.153
and I'm running
for class president.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.488
- Yeah?
- I understand

06:02.571 --> 06:03.947
you had a baby last year.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.075
If you bring it in,
I'll try to kiss it.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.210
Vote Sheldon
for class president.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.545
Vote Sheldon
for class president.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.757
Vote Sheldon for
class president.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.509
Don't worry...
it's a number two.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.302
You can use it on
standardized tests.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.055
- Okay.
- And, of course, homework.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.348
I love homework.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.683
Well, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.976
I'm Nell Cavanaugh.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.395
My opponent.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.147
I would shake your hand,
but my mom is washing my mittens.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.066
Okay.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.111
She was really nice.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.196
She even said,
"May the best student win."

06:44.279 --> 06:45.531
That's sweet.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.116
This was a great idea.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.451
Children like cupcakes,
and by giving them cupcakes,

06:49.535 --> 06:51.620
they'll transfer
that affinity to me.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.873
That's another way
of looking at it.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.793
By that reasoning, a rich person
could simply buy people's votes.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.711
It's been known to happen.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.673
Until my ship comes in,
I guess it's cupcakes.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.008
Georgie, check it out.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.511
Oh, man, I hate
that he's doing this.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.846
What? It's cute.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.139
It's embarrassing.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.516
I would think
you'd be proud of him.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.060
That's 'cause you're
a better person than me.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.604
Maybe you ought to ask God
to take away your anger

07:17.688 --> 07:19.148
and replace it with love.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.567
Can I ask him to take away
my brother instead?

07:21.650 --> 07:22.818
Georgie.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.611
Not kill him.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.530
Just strand him
on an island somewhere.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.367
A nice island,
with coconuts and stuff.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.760
Nell Cavanaugh,

07:48.844 --> 07:51.930
it appears
we're taking the mittens off.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.391
Well, that's unfortunate.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.143
Oh, this goes
well beyond unfortunate.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.728
It's flat-out unfair.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.063
Did you not say
that you love homework?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.191
Of course I said it.
I say it all the time.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.068
But she took it out of context
and is using it against me.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
Well, that is what happens
in politics.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.697
People stretch the truth.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.532
Well, those people
are dirty dogs.

08:10.616 --> 08:11.742
They certainly are.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.827
Now, let me ask you something.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.871
How bad do you want
to win this election?

08:15.954 --> 08:19.041
Bad enough to let 105 kids
shake my mitten.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.444
Okay, then you need
to toughen up.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.711
Politics is not
for the weak-kneed.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.464
Are you suggesting
that I fight fire with fire?

08:25.547 --> 08:26.757
I am.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.135
So going to my room and crying
in my pillow is not an option?

08:30.219 --> 08:31.345
It is not.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.265
Then I have some thinking to do.

08:37.893 --> 08:38.894
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

08:38.977 --> 08:40.229
You're screwed.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.897
Which is why
I need your help.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.065
Why me?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.609
You're ruthless.
I've seen you cheat at Candy Land.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.903
Thanks. Go on.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.279
Well, I'd like to retaliate,

08:49.363 --> 08:50.822
but I don't know
anything about her.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.950
Make something up.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.035
Ooh, tell people
she has head lice.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.037
I won't resort to lying.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.666
There's a Denise Cavanaugh
in my class.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.834
- Could be her little sister.
- So?

09:02.918 --> 09:04.604
I'll see if I can dig up
something about Nell

09:04.628 --> 09:05.879
you can use against her.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.506
Thank you.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.217
Georgie, I hate
to have to ask this,

09:10.300 --> 09:12.052
but are you going
to vote for me?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.428
No. Go away.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.513
Are you sure?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.723
If I win, I can make
you a hall monitor.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.767
Imagine the respect
you'll get then.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.519
Get lost.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.779
<i>Lord, please take away my anger
toward my stupid brother.</i>

09:30.862 --> 09:32.114
<i>My life is hard enough.</i>

09:32.197 --> 09:33.865
<i>Don't let him be president.</i>

09:33.949 --> 09:35.867
<i>And while we're talking,</i>

09:35.951 --> 09:37.995
<i>Veronica... help me out.</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:41.248
<i>Encourage her to do something
with me she'll regret.</i>

09:41.331 --> 09:42.416
<i>Amen.</i>

09:45.669 --> 09:48.839
Remember, tomorrow
we'll be dissecting worms!

09:50.340 --> 09:52.759
Ah, your sadness makes me happy.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.803
Mr. Givens,
I just wanted you to know

09:54.886 --> 09:56.805
that I'm still working hard
on my campaign

09:56.888 --> 09:58.974
to get more funding
for the science department.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.352
Oh, great, 'cause I've got to
dig up tomorrow's worms myself.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.813
Anything you can do to help me
win a decisive victory

10:04.896 --> 10:06.857
come Election Day
would be much appreciated.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.358
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Sheldon.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.562
The faculty doesn't get involved
in student elections.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.321
Oh, I understand.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.740
You have to remain neutral.
Wink, wink.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.117
I'm sorry, wink, wink?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.745
You want new science equipment
and I want that for you.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.539
One hand washes the other.
Wink, wink.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.334
Oh, sure, wink, wink.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.086
Now you're getting it.
Wink, wink.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.047
Wink, wink.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.173
Wink, wink.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.176
That kid creeps me out.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.179
<i>Another hurdle in my political
career was glossophobia:</i>

10:37.262 --> 10:38.930
<i>fear of public speaking.</i>

10:39.014 --> 10:42.142
<i>I've been known to experience
dry mouth, perspiration,</i>

10:42.225 --> 10:44.311
<i>heart palpitations,
and fainting.</i>

10:44.394 --> 10:46.104
<i>A similar response
to what I experience</i>

10:46.188 --> 10:47.648
<i>around unleashed dogs.</i>

10:47.731 --> 10:49.691
Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.610
Can I please speak
with Pastor Jeff?

10:51.693 --> 10:54.529
<i>Hold on.</i>

10:55.947 --> 10:57.783
Hey, Sheldon,
what can I do for you?

10:57.866 --> 10:59.701
I need to give
a speech at school,

10:59.785 --> 11:01.662
but I have a fear
of public speaking.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.455
Since you give a sermon
every Sunday,

11:03.538 --> 11:05.415
I was hoping you'd have
some words of advice.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.876
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.296
When I look down on my
congregation and I feel nervous,

11:11.380 --> 11:14.299
I just ask the Lord
to speak through me.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.301
Like a ventriloquist?

11:16.885 --> 11:17.886
Not exactly.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.429
I think of it more as a...

11:19.513 --> 11:20.681
Like one of the Muppets?

11:20.764 --> 11:22.099
No, not that either.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.142
'Cause you do look
a little like Kermit.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.561
Uh, okay, good luck to you,
Sheldon.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.563
Hello?

11:28.647 --> 11:30.774
Dr. Sturgis.
Can you give me any advice

11:30.857 --> 11:33.068
on how to overcome a fear
of public speaking?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.821
Ah, you know,
when I was a young man

11:35.904 --> 11:39.574
I had a terrible fear
of speaking to an audience.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.159
What did you do?

11:41.243 --> 11:43.662
Actually, it kinda took care
of itself.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.332
One day I was, uh,
playing miniature golf

11:47.416 --> 11:51.128
with some colleagues
and I got struck by lightning.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.255
- Oh, dear.
<i>- No, it was fine.</i>

11:53.338 --> 11:57.801
When I came to, I found myself
with the gift of gab.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.136
<i>Big crowds,</i>

11:59.219 --> 12:01.847
small crowds,
you couldn't shut me up.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.765
I don't see how
that can benefit me.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.435
Not unless you'd like me
to take you miniature golfing

12:06.518 --> 12:09.062
next time there are clouds
on the horizon.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.157
- Everything okay?
- No.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.076
I have to give a speech
in front of the entire assembly.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.704
Oh. Got a little stage fright?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.456
Unfortunately so.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.459
Just thinking about it
causes my bladder to misbehave.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.711
Yeah, I been there.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.379
You have?

12:34.463 --> 12:35.922
Sure.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.466
When I first started coaching,

12:37.549 --> 12:39.176
I was real nervous
to talk to the team,

12:39.259 --> 12:41.386
you know,
give a locker room speech.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.305
Then one day
it dawned on me.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.390
I'm not just talking
to football players.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.809
I'm talking
to teenage football players.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.061
Most of them aren't listening
to a word I'm saying.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.980
That's an interesting
perspective.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.648
I'll tell you something else.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.318
You don't give yourself enough
credit for how brave you are.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.695
- I don't?
- No.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.865
Sheldon, you are ten years old,
going to high school.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.076
Everyone's older than you,
everyone's bigger than you,

13:05.160 --> 13:09.122
but you keep at it,
day after day.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.500
That's brave.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.502
Any kid who can do that
could give a speech

13:13.585 --> 13:16.254
to the United Nations
if he had to.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.549
Thanks, Dad.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.019
I heard what you
said in there.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.146
- That was very beautiful.
- Thanks.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.441
I gave a similar speech
to my team last week.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.819
Boy, did we get
our asses kicked.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.616
<i>Emboldened by my
father's pep talk,</i>

13:44.699 --> 13:46.493
<i>I began working on my speech.</i>

13:46.576 --> 13:48.662
<i>I aspired to walk
in the footsteps</i>

13:48.745 --> 13:50.831
<i>of history's greatest orators:</i>

13:50.914 --> 13:53.083
<i>Socrates, Winston Churchill,</i>

13:53.166 --> 13:56.169
<i>and, last but not least,
Professor Proton.</i>

13:56.253 --> 13:57.921
Hey, I spoke to Nell's sister.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.673
Found out some
interesting stuff.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.176
Thanks, but I've decided
I don't want to stoop to her level.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.345
If I can't win on the quality
of my ideas,

14:05.428 --> 14:07.597
then I'd rather lose
with my head held high.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.974
That's really stupid,

14:09.057 --> 14:11.434
but in case you change
your mind...

14:14.104 --> 14:16.523
All right, y'all have heard

14:16.606 --> 14:19.526
from your secretary candidates,
your treasurer candidates,

14:19.609 --> 14:21.236
your vice presidents...

14:21.319 --> 14:23.280
It's time for the big finale,

14:23.780 --> 14:26.908
the closing event,
the headliners...

14:26.992 --> 14:30.036
Nell Cavanaugh
and Sheldon Cooper.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.290
One of these two will be
president of your class,

14:33.373 --> 14:36.293
so listen to what they've got
to say and choose wisely,

14:36.376 --> 14:39.337
which will be a whole new
experience for most of you.

14:39.421 --> 14:43.049
Remember, heckling
will get you detention.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.467
Bite me!

14:44.551 --> 14:46.636
Bryan Larkin, two days!

14:46.720 --> 14:48.722
You want to try for a week?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.724
I didn't think so.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.767
Nell, floor is yours.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.776
Nell!

15:02.986 --> 15:05.155
Thank you, Ms. MacElroy,

15:05.238 --> 15:07.616
Principal Petersen,
our hard-working teachers,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.117
and my fellow students.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.579
I'm blessed to call
so many of you friends.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.432
Y'all probably know everything
about me already.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.124
Lord knows I love to talk.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.754
So instead of going on
about myself,

15:20.837 --> 15:23.840
I'd like to talk to you
about my opponent.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.759
Sheldon Cooper has been lobbying

15:25.842 --> 15:28.053
for new science equipment here
at Medford High,

15:28.136 --> 15:31.890
and while that sounds wonderful,
the truth is,

15:31.973 --> 15:37.145
he thinks our school wastes
its money on football.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.275
Do we really want
a class president

15:42.359 --> 15:45.236
who doesn't care about football?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.197
No!

15:47.280 --> 15:49.950
I know I am proud to be
a Medford High cheerleader,

15:50.033 --> 15:51.785
and I love football!

15:55.705 --> 16:00.126
But you know the one thing
I love more than football?

16:00.210 --> 16:01.795
God.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.193
Let me tell you
another interesting fact

16:08.259 --> 16:09.386
about my opponent.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.723
Did you know that Sheldon Cooper
is an atheist?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.684
That's right.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.728
He doesn't believe in God.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.397
Just keep that in mind

16:20.480 --> 16:22.816
when you cast your vote today.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.860
I'm Nell Cavanaugh.
Go Wolves!

16:33.910 --> 16:36.621
And now, please welcome
Sheldon Cooper.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.512
No one would fault you
if you ran out the back door.

17:19.247 --> 17:22.709
Nell Cavanaugh is... a Yankee.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.881
She may love football
and she may love God,

17:27.964 --> 17:29.632
but she was born in Scarsdale.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.342
That's in New York.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.346
There's more.

17:35.430 --> 17:39.100
My opponent didn't move to Texas
until she was seven years old.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.019
In fact, in her bedroom

17:41.102 --> 17:43.646
there is a pennant
for the New York Yankees.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.238
While I may not be a fan
of organized religion or sports,

17:52.322 --> 17:55.283
I promise, if you vote for me,
I'll do my best

17:55.366 --> 17:58.078
to get new science equipment
for our school.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.291
Uh...

18:04.000 --> 18:05.794
Don't mess with Texas!

18:12.217 --> 18:14.761
Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon!

18:14.844 --> 18:18.389
Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon!
Sheldon!

18:18.473 --> 18:21.017
Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon!

18:21.101 --> 18:23.144
Sheldon! Sheldon!

18:37.784 --> 18:40.078
<i>Before I became
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,</i>

18:40.161 --> 18:41.913
<i>I was President Sheldon Cooper.</i>

18:41.996 --> 18:43.164
<i>And I don't mind telling you,</i>

18:43.248 --> 18:45.792
<i>they both look pretty darn good
on business cards.</i>

18:45.875 --> 18:48.503
<i>One of my first responsibilities
as class president</i>

18:48.586 --> 18:50.839
<i>was delivering
the morning announcements.</i>

18:50.922 --> 18:53.675
Please rise
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.928
I pledge allegiance
to the Flag...

18:57.011 --> 18:59.389
Of the United States of America...

18:59.472 --> 19:02.308
And to the Republic
for which it stands...

19:02.392 --> 19:03.852
One Nation...

19:03.935 --> 19:06.062
Here's a fun fact
about the next two words:

19:06.146 --> 19:08.523
"Under God" wasn't added
to the Pledge of Allegiance

19:08.606 --> 19:09.983
<i>until 1954.</i>

19:10.066 --> 19:12.026
<i>My first act as your president</i>

19:12.110 --> 19:14.362
is to remove the words
"under God" from the Pledge

19:14.445 --> 19:15.530
<i>in order to honor</i>

19:15.613 --> 19:17.240
the separation
of church and state

19:17.323 --> 19:18.783
in this public high school.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.243
<i>Okay, that's enough.</i>

19:20.326 --> 19:21.661
<i>You can't take my microphone.</i>

19:21.744 --> 19:23.454
<i>- I'm the president.</i>
- Thank you.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.748
<i>All right, let's try this again.</i>

19:25.832 --> 19:27.500
I pledge allegiance
to the Flag...

19:27.584 --> 19:29.919
Of the United States of America,

19:30.003 --> 19:33.089
and to the Republic
for which it stands...

19:33.173 --> 19:34.340
One Nation

19:34.424 --> 19:35.592
under God,

19:35.675 --> 19:39.804
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.
