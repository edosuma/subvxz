BEAUTIFUL, THE WINNER. IT'S

18:03.410 --> 18:04.809
GODDAMN EXHAUSTING, IS WHAT IT

18:04.810 --> 18:07.176
IS. YOU TRYING TO TELL ME YOU

18:07.180 --> 18:08.317
DON'T GET WORN DOWN BY

18:12.220 --> 18:14.518
BETTER THAN BELUGA. I LIKE ANEJO

18:14.520 --> 18:15.782
BETTER THAN REPESADO. I LIKE

18:15.790 --> 18:17.326
BLONDES WHO CAN SUCK THE YELLOW

18:17.330 --> 18:18.456
OUT OF A CANARY BETTER THAN

18:18.460 --> 18:20.394
BRUNETTES WITH GREAT ASSES.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.355
I LIKE THEM WHEN I WANT THEM,

18:21.360 --> 18:22.622
AND I LIKE THEM HOW I WANT THEM.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.791

18:34.810 --> 18:36.471
I WROTE HER A BUNCH OF LETTERS

18:36.480 --> 18:38.368
FROM PRISON, BUT SHE MUST HAVE

18:38.380 --> 18:40.177
CHANGED HER ADDRESS BECAUSE SHE

18:40.180 --> 18:41.215
NEVER WROTE ME BACK.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.314
>> AHEM. CONSIDER YOURSELF

18:44.320 --> 18:46.242
LUCKY. HER VENOM HAS BECOME MORE

18:46.250 --> 18:47.285
POTENT WITH AGE.

>> WELL, HER PIMP HAND IS

18:57.270 --> 18:58.521
STRONG.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.758
>> BULLSHIT. THE ONLY THING

18:59.770 --> 19:01.328
STRONG ABOUT HER ARE HER VAGINA

19:01.340 --> 19:03.501
MUSCLES. WHEN YOU TIRE OF THOSE,

19:03.510 --> 19:05.660
SHE AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'.

UP YOUR ASS, BUT SHE'S ALWAYS

19:09.410 --> 19:10.843
HAD YOU BY THE BALLS.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.499
KIMBER PLAYS LIKE SHE'S A

19:13.650 --> 19:15.447
UP SHE SEEMS, SHE'S ALWAYS IN

19:15.450 --> 19:17.680
CONTROL. SHE'S LIKE THOSE

19:17.690 --> 19:18.941
300 POUND JUGGERNAUTS IN

19:18.950 --> 19:20.315
PRISON--YOU WANT TO TAKE HER

19:20.320 --> 19:21.457
DOWN, YOU GOT TO SNEAK UP BEHIND

19:21.460 --> 19:22.813
HER AND CLUB HER OVER THE HEAD

19:22.820 --> 19:24.879
BEFORE SHE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.834
>> I'LL BE OUTSIDE IF YOU NEED

20:05.330 --> 20:06.820
ALL I WANT IS AN OPERATION IN

20:06.830 --> 20:08.866
EXCHANGE FOR YOUR FREEDOM. YOU

20:08.870 --> 20:09.859
SHOULD SHOW A LITTLE

20:09.870 --> 20:12.634
APPRECIATION FOR MY GENEROSITY.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.768
> > APPRECIATION?

20:15.780 --> 20:17.008

20:17.010 --> 20:19.740
WORSE RIGHT NOW IF I WANTED

20:19.750 --> 20:20.978
IT TO BE.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.379
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY LIFE

20:22.380 --> 20:23.688
IS RIGHT NOW.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.817
>> POOR BABY. DID SOMEONE LOSE

20:25.820 --> 20:27.708
YOUR SHIRT AT THE DRY CLEANING?

20:27.720 --> 20:28.812
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

20:28.820 --> 20:30.424
WITH PROBLEMS? MY SON JUST

20:30.430 --> 20:31.727
MARRIED MY PARTNER'S

20:31.730 --> 20:32.788
EX-GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE HE GOT HER

20:32.790 --> 20:33.893
PREGNANT AND I JUST FOUND OUT MY

20:42.640 --> 20:43.959
SEAN, IF SHE'S STEPPING OUT ON

20:43.970 --> 20:44.800
YOU, YOU MUST HAVE DONE

20:44.810 --> 20:46.368
SOMETHING TO PISS HER OFF.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.974
YOU TWO NOT BANGING STEADY

20:52.510 --> 20:53.943
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

20:53.950 --> 20:57.340
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

20:57.350 --> 20:58.544
>> YEAH, BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU

20:58.550 --> 20:59.642
NEED TO DO NOW.

20:59.650 --> 21:00.582
>> KILL THE MAN SHE SLEPT WITH,

21:02.490 --> 21:03.980
I AM, SEAN, AN ANIMAL?

21:03.990 --> 21:04.922
WHAT I WAS GONNA TELL YOU IS TO

21:04.930 --> 21:07.592
GO HOME, CONFESS WHAT YOU DID,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.329
BEG FOR FORGIVENESS AND THEN

21:09.330 --> 21:10.399
BANG YOUR WIFE LIKE YOU NEVER

21:10.400 --> 21:12.061
BANGED HER BEFORE, MAN. SEE,

21:12.070 --> 21:14.038
A REAL MAN TAKES RESPONSIBILITY

21:14.040 --> 21:16.395
FOR HIS ACTION. HE STANDS UP

21:16.400 --> 21:17.958
TO HIS MISTAKES. HELL, I'D BE

21:17.970 --> 21:19.904
PROUD IF MY SON MARRIED THE

21:19.910 --> 21:22.435
GIRL HE KNOCKED UP.

21:22.440 --> 21:26.570
>> I'M NOT LIKE YOU. MY WIFE

21:26.580 --> 21:27.717
FINDS OUT WHAT I DID, SHE'LL

21:27.720 --> 21:28.778
LEAVE.

21:28.780 --> 21:29.815
>> IF SHE SCREWED AROUND,

21:29.820 --> 21:30.980
YOU'RE BOTH ON EVEN GROUND.

21:30.990 --> 21:31.888
YOU GOT A GOOD CHANCE TO SAVE

21:31.890 --> 21:35.553
YOUR MARRIAGE.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.687
YOU KEEP TRYING TO LIVE A LIE,

21:37.690 --> 21:39.829
BAD SHIT HAPPENS.

21:39.830 --> 21:44.767
I'M LIVING PROOF.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.522
>> FEEL MY FINGER?

21:46.530 --> 21:48.031
>> THANK YOU.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.860

22:02.450 --> 22:03.849
WITH MATT, AND THE ONLY THING

22:03.850 --> 22:05.488
THAT WOULD MAKE ME BETTER WAS

22:05.490 --> 22:07.117
A COKE AND A BAG OF TWIZZLERS.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.849
HA HA HA.

22:08.860 --> 22:09.758
>> WE BELIEVE THAT ANY PAIN

22:09.760 --> 22:10.920
IN THE BODY IS CAUSED BY A LACK

22:10.930 --> 22:12.625
OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE AREA.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.995
TOUCH ASSIST ALLOWS US TO

22:14.000 --> 22:16.127
RECONNECT. SHALL WE CONTINUE?

22:16.130 --> 22:18.064
>> PLEASE.

22:20.670 --> 22:24.003
SO, MY BABY'S REACT IVE MIND WILL

22:24.010 --> 22:25.602
RECORD ANYTHING THAT'S SAID

22:25.610 --> 22:26.668
DURING THE BIRTH?

22:26.670 --> 22:28.399
>> ANY WORDS. EVEN, "PUSH" OR

22:28.410 --> 22:29.809
"YOU'RE DOING GREAT" IMPLANT

22:29.810 --> 22:31.004
THEMSELVES IN THE INFANT'S BRAIN

22:31.010 --> 22:32.500
AND EFFECT HIS EMOTIONAL

22:32.510 --> 22:33.169
WELL-BEING FOR THE REST

22:33.180 --> 22:34.579
OF HIS LIFE. THAT'S WHAT A

22:34.580 --> 22:35.877
SILENT BIRTH IS ALL ABOUT.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.108
I HEAR THAT KELLY PRESTON GAVE

22:37.120 --> 22:38.485
BIRTH TO BOTH OF HER CHILDREN

22:38.490 --> 22:39.479
SILENTLY.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.458
>> WHO'S KELLY PRESTON?

22:41.460 --> 22:42.984
>> HONEY, WILL YOU GO GET ME

22:42.990 --> 22:44.150

22:55.040 --> 22:56.769
KIMBER, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHILE

22:56.770 --> 22:58.761
KELLY PRESTON MAY HAVE A VERY

22:58.770 --> 23:00.533
HIGH TOLERANCE FOR PAIN, THERE

23:00.540 --> 23:02.178
IS NOT ONE WOMAN I KNOW WHO CAN

23:02.180 --> 23:03.704
GET THROUGH NATURAL CHILDBIRTH

23:03.710 --> 23:05.177
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.477
>> WELL, I'M NOT TAKING

23:06.480 --> 23:08.175
ANY DRUGS. THE CHURCH DOESN'T

23:08.180 --> 23:10.068
PROHIBIT IT, BUT THEY DO FEEL

23:10.080 --> 23:12.514
THAT A DRUGLESS DELIVERY IS BEST

23:12.520 --> 23:13.509
FOR THE CHILD IN TERMS OF

23:13.520 --> 23:14.919
DEVELOPMENT.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.184
CAN I SAY "OUCH?"

23:17.190 --> 23:18.657
>> WE'D PREFER IF YOU JUST

MOAN ED.

23:19.660 --> 23:22.458
>> OK. WHAT ABOUT "OW?"

23:22.460 --> 23:24.462
>> MORE LIKE "AHHH."

23:24.470 --> 23:26.199
>> AHHH.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.033
>> AHHH.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.803

IN THAT HOLE TO PUT THIS WHOLE

42:48.800 --> 42:50.324
THING TOGETHER.

42:50.330 --> 42:52.366
IT WAS LIGHTING MY OWN FACE

ON FIRE. MAN, THAT HURT LIKE A

42:55.770 --> 42:58.637
SON OF A BITCH.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.036
IN MY HOUSE?

43:01.040 --> 43:01.972
>> OH, I JUST CAME BY TO GET RID

43:01.980 --> 43:03.732

RELAX, SEAN, I MEANT THE

43:05.310 --> 43:06.675
EVIDENCE OF THE CRIME YOU

WORD, YOU KNOW? IT'S WHEN YOU

43:32.010 --> 43:33.705
DON'T LIVE YOUR LIFE HONESTLY

43:33.710 --> 43:35.803
THAT YOU GET INTO TROUBLE.

43:35.810 --> 43:36.834
BELIEVE ME, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
