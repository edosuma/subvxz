WOMAN: Previously on Grimm...

00:02.280 --> 00:03.770
Let me ask you something, Nick.

00:04.240 --> 00:05.360
What's really bothering you,

00:05.400 --> 00:06.811
the fact that
you killed somebody

00:06.880 --> 00:08.769
or the fact that you killed
somebody who wasn't Wesen?

00:08.840 --> 00:11.366
MALE REPORTER: Europe and the world
have gathered today in Vienna, Austria,

00:11.440 --> 00:14.205
to mourn the passing
of Crown Prince Eric Renard.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.611
RENARD: Gonna be leaving
town for a little while.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.125
Does this have to do
with your brother's death?

00:17.240 --> 00:18.844
Maybe. You in some
kind of danger?

00:18.920 --> 00:20.046
I would assume so.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.326
Been a long time
since I've been back.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.323
I wouldn't want what happened to
your brother to happen to you.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.561
(GUNSHOTS)

00:28.600 --> 00:30.682
MEISNER: Verrat. You
call this a safe house?

00:30.800 --> 00:32.848
Time to leave.
Who knew I was coming?

00:33.240 --> 00:35.368
Too many. But Breslau
set up the safe house.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.566
I can't wait to meet him.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.205
MAN: The prince will
see you now.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.362
The prince?
Life goes on, my dear.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.090
So does the family business.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.003
MAN: Hello,
Miss Schade.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.809
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.810
MAN: Eric and I were second
cousins on my mother's side.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.324
We were quite close.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.284
I was devastated by his passing

01:26.360 --> 01:29.170
in such a violent, obscene way.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.525
I will do everything in my power

01:31.600 --> 01:34.683
to bring to justice the men
responsible for this act.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.091
Or women.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.090
That being said,

01:43.160 --> 01:46.323
I wish to retain your legal
services to the family.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.321
You'll stay on in
your present position.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.924
I'll be counting on you to honor
your relationship with Eric,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.368
which I understand
was rather intimate.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.205
The police in several countries

02:05.280 --> 02:07.647
are putting together
their list of suspects.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.728
But I, too, have a list.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.571
It is my belief that whatever
happened to Eric in Portland

02:13.640 --> 02:17.850
had consequences for him
here when he returned.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.808
I understand you
spent time there.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.760
Yes.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.446
And you know another cousin
of mine, Sean Renard.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.320
Yes.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.607
I think of him
more as a half cousin.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.684
And you've encountered
Nicholas Burkhardt.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.091
The Grimm.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.767
To get us started
off on the right foot,

02:48.760 --> 02:50.205
I'd like you to
put together a list

02:50.280 --> 02:51.770
of everyone you knew in Portland

02:51.840 --> 02:55.242
who you think might have had a hand
in my cousin's untimely death.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.642
We're gonna have so
very much to talk about.

through the front door.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.885
No, I slept the whole flight.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.244
What time do you
get in tomorrow?

04:07.320 --> 04:08.924
I'll pick you up at the airport.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.971
Are you sure?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.246
All right.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.527
Well, I can't wait to see you.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.524
And tell Dad I'm breaking into
his liquor cabinet tonight.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.011
Yeah. Love you too.

How the hell you do that?

05:47.640 --> 05:50.689
Well, in the good old days,
they'd do it with horses.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.807
What about now?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.689
Somebody big...

05:53.760 --> 05:55.524
And very powerful.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.364
"Somebody"?

05:59.080 --> 06:00.081
(CHUCKLES)

06:00.280 --> 06:03.682
Now, these footprints
are size 15 or bigger.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.450
They're bigger.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.842
We might be dealing
with a Siegbarste again.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.962
Again? You remember Oleg Stark?

06:15.520 --> 06:16.521
(GROANING)

06:25.640 --> 06:27.608
Siegbarste, right.
I remember.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.724
He could pull
somebody's arm off.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.882
HANK: Victim's flight
arrived at 10:15.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.405

Cabbie picks up another
fare 10 minutes later.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.643

06:39.720 --> 06:42.246
Southwest burglary reported two
other break-ins this week.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.563
First one on Flower and Corbett
and the second at Thompson.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.610
Thompson? That's pretty close
to where this one went down.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.165
Witnesses?
None.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.287
Nobody home at the time.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.771
Well, except the Himber house.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.126
Scott comes home
and gets killed.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.850
So can we tie
these three together?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.684
We can check the pawn shops.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.888
If the same guy's fencing stuff
from all three robberies...

07:00.000 --> 07:02.002

I'll take the pawn shops,
you take the M.E.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.367
Wonder what she thinks
tore this kid's arm off.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.284
I've seen shark
bites powerful enough

07:17.360 --> 07:20.011
to separate the humerus
clean from the socket.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.084
The force of the bite crushed
both the ulna and the radius.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.128
But the actual cause of death

07:25.200 --> 07:28.522
was not shock or loss of
blood, but a broken neck.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.965
Whatever got a hold of this
guy gave him a good shaking.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.646
Multiple fractures
of the long bones

07:37.720 --> 07:40.291
And a subdural hematoma, which
is bleeding in the brain.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.169
And that happened before
his arm got torn off?

07:42.240 --> 07:45.210
Probably the action that caused
the guy's arm to get torn off.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.566
Thanks.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.721

who set us up, Sebastien.

that tried to kill us.

I didn't.

anything at the moment.

arrived two days ago.

The family wants him
to take your brother's place.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.045
I don't know that much about him

12:10.120 --> 12:11.485
except that Eric
never trusted him.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.290
Not sure if that's good or bad.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.601
He's determined to find out
who killed your brother.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.250
We need to get you
to a safer place.

12:18.320 --> 12:22.245
No, no more safe places. This will do.
Where's the meeting?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.084
I don't know where,
but I know when.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.491
Midnight tomorrow.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.609
Frenay and Tavitian will be there.
Tavitian wants to meet you.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.604
Your brother's death has
caused a lot of speculation.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.444
Some think he was involved.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.769
That won't hurt his reputation.

Tavitian doesn't
need any help from us.

and some more ammunition.

went to check it out.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.002
How long was he down?

12:50.120 --> 12:52.168
About five minutes.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.483
We had radio contact,
then, I don't know.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.800
Something got to him.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.524
By the time we got him up...

12:59.720 --> 13:01.609
I've been on this job 30 years

13:01.680 --> 13:04.411
and this is the first time
we ever lost anybody.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.606

Just Jimmy.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.003

they brought him out.

Let's take a look.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.688
Only time I've ever
seen something like this

13:24.760 --> 13:26.683
was when I was called out
by the Forest Service.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.330
A hiker was
ripped apart by a bear.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.243
Looks like
the same kind of tear.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.607
If you ask me,
it's an alligator.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.330
I know it sounds crazy,
but when I was a kid

13:34.400 --> 13:36.004
my uncle who lived
in New York told me

13:36.080 --> 13:37.809
that alligators
lived in the sewers.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.249
I was so scared, I peed in the
bathtub the whole time I was there.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.529
Like you wouldn't do the same.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.682
Charlie, is there someone
who can take us down there?

13:48.760 --> 13:50.046
That'd be me.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.928
CHARLIE: And there's always
the danger of suffocation.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.970

case anything goes wrong.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.291
We're good to go.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.925
Stay close.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.925
Not claustrophobic, are you?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.445
Not really.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.964
Look, you don't have to go down there.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.644
No problemo, I got this.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.690
We'll be in some confined spaces,
especially as we move in.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.368
How confined? CHARLIE:
These tunnels, up to 10.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.171
Small pipes may
be only three feet wide.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.285

this area and went to check it out.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.724
This the last
contact you made with him?

15:04.840 --> 15:06.251
I think he went farther in.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.243
Look like blood
on the wall here.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.284
There's some more over there.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.321
I'm sure whatever got him
is probably long gone.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.041
Huh.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.244
Got something.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.970
Looks like a backpack.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.769
Looks like there's more.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.528
We should take
everything back with us.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.364
And by "we" you mean?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.601
You'd be surprised
at what we find down here.

15:40.680 --> 15:44.127
Usually it ends up in the river
unless there's a blockage.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.168
How many more miles
of tunnel are there?

15:46.240 --> 15:48.607
We got 456 miles of storm pipe,

15:48.680 --> 15:51.126
878 miles of
combined sewer pipe,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.282
and 58,000 catch basins.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.169
Anybody else been
down here recently?

15:55.240 --> 15:57.561
Unless there's a problem,
we don't come down.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.847
Hold on, I gotta go with you.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.805
Uh, guys?

16:14.240 --> 16:19.451
Well, I'm sure whatever got
him is long gone by now.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.162
This is south section.
Shh.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.405
What you got?

16:45.040 --> 16:47.088
Too much.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.924
WU: Hey, I think I
found something else!

17:02.160 --> 17:03.491
What is this?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.805
It's stuck.

17:21.359 --> 17:22.849
I didn't expect that.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.848
It's Jimmy's leg!

17:32.080 --> 17:36.802
Got a medical alert bracelet
belonging to a Michelle Fenton.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.890
I got a Michelle Fenton reporting
a robbery November 27.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.009
Home location, Sellwood Park.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.570
That is the third
in Sellwood Park.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.484
Mr. Darren Gifford's
briefcase.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.483
Oh, I got a Gifford.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.040
House was robbed
three weeks ago in...

17:57.840 --> 17:59.171
Homestead.

18:00.480 --> 18:05.771
Homestead has five break-ins
reported, all within a few days.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.604
Got a gym card on a key ring.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.205
I'll try to find
out who it belongs to.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.009
I'll call the gym.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.484
So this guys targets
certain neighborhoods

18:13.560 --> 18:15.289
until things get hot,
then he moves on.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.488
I don't see how this connects
to the attack in the tunnel.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.289
It's worthless stuff.
Why keep it?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.203
Guy could have just dumped
this stuff in the gutter.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.884
Well, maybe there's
something else down there.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.043
So how do we explain the
similarities between the attacks?

18:26.120 --> 18:28.771
Got two severed limbs,
one above ground, one below.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.367
Gym card belongs to our
murder victim, Scott Himber.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.642
(CELL PHONE RINGING) I'd
say that's a connection.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.120
Yeah?

18:40.360 --> 18:41.885
Thanks for the update.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.326
Closest match to the bite
mark on the severed leg?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.731
Don't tell me.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.404
Alligator.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.608
Problem is, alligators
don't rob houses.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.968
MONROE: If you're talking about
what I think you're talking about:

18:58.040 --> 18:59.644
A Wesen that hides underground

18:59.720 --> 19:00.926
and can rip limbs like taffy?

That's what we're talking about.

Still no.

make them irritable.

19:09.720 --> 19:10.960
What's the "yes" part?

19:11.040 --> 19:12.451
A Gelumcaedus.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.124
Never heard of it. Well,
why would you have?

19:14.200 --> 19:15.406
I mean, I've never
even seen one.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.561
But I'm telling you, if you got

19:16.680 --> 19:17.761
a Gelumcaedus in
the storm drain,

19:17.880 --> 19:19.644
you better be damn sure you
know what you're up against.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.683
Would be my suggestion,
but I can't go right now.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.240
I'm in the middle
of making dinner here.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.080
No problem.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.246
No, don't worry about it.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.164
I'm sure we'll have no problem
finding a Gelum... What is it?

19:31.240 --> 19:32.526
No idea.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.931
Well, at least we know
it starts with a

19:33.960 --> 19:35.849

All right, all right.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.524
Here, look, I'll write
it down for you.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.045
And you know,
there's plenty of food.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.565
So, look, why don't
you just go get the books,

19:40.640 --> 19:42.005
bring 'em back,
and what the hell?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.401
Invite Juliette.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.721
We'll make a party of it,
figure this one out together.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.044
Too soon for him to be back.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.922
Sorry. Frenay wants us
there now. We must leave.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.800
It looks clear, but...

20:20.840 --> 20:23.571
I'll go first,
but I suggest we go fast.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.802
All right.
Let's go.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.322
ROSALEE: This one's
from London, 1916.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.482
"Having ventured
further into the sewers,

20:34.560 --> 20:36.927
"we were almost
overcome by the fumes.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.800
"It is easy to see why Gelumcaedus
chose this place to live.

20:40.880 --> 20:43.326
"Without the breathing

20:43.400 --> 20:45.562
"we could never have survived
the fetid conditions."

20:45.680 --> 20:48.445
It looks like something out
of a Jules Verne novel.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.402
"We were finally confronted
by the Gelumcaedus

20:51.520 --> 20:53.010
"beneath Farringdon Road.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.050
"The Gelumcaedus had just
emerged from a dormant period

20:56.120 --> 20:59.090
"common for them, during which
they retreat into the hellholes

20:59.160 --> 21:02.687
"they fashion for themselves,
living off their plunder."

21:03.000 --> 21:04.923
I don't think our
guy's in a dormant period.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.525
I got something.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.649
It says here Gelumcaedus is one
of the oldest known Wesen.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.724
Served in the Praetorian
Guard under Caligula's reign

21:12.800 --> 21:15.201
and they were hired to protect
the newly-built aqueducts.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.611
Probably why they
like storm drains.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.727
Exactly.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.962
It says when Rome fell,
they retreated to

21:20.040 --> 21:22.646
the underground waterways
to avoid execution.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.603
Hey, hold on.
There's more here.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.529
"I regret to
report that Reginald,

21:26.600 --> 21:28.568

What's a vambrace?

21:41.480 --> 21:42.720
This.

Whoa!

21:45.320 --> 21:47.322
I think I have one of
those in the trailer.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.640
Well, of course you do.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.881
I just didn't
know what it was for.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.086
Well, now you do.

21:51.160 --> 21:55.484
So if the kid and the sewer worker
were killed by Gelumcaedus,

21:55.560 --> 21:57.130
he's still gotta be
down in the tunnels.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.645
We have to go back in.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.848
And not as cops.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.331
WOMAN: There are the two
big interceptor tunnels

22:02.400 --> 22:05.085
on both sides of the river,
another off the Columbia Slough.

They connect to the larger
storm drain and sewer tunnels.

Some are new.
Some are 80 years old.

Where are the entrances
to the storm drain tunnels?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.206
Besides the manholes?

22:13.280 --> 22:16.489
That'd be through the outfalls where
excess runoff drains to the river.

Where are those?

for a car to drive in.

are, Sellwood, Northwest.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.802

Sheridan, Kings Heights.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.724
And all robberies are clustered
around the outfalls.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.201
I think he's using the
tunnels as an escape route.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.123
To where?
Where does he come out?

22:58.200 --> 22:59.565
Maybe he doesn't. Look.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.085
The Sheridan
Outfall leads directly

23:01.160 --> 23:02.764
to where all
the other tunnels intersect.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.761
Close to where
the sewer worker was killed.

So between where
the worker was killed

23:07.560 --> 23:09.210
and the tunnels intersect...

23:10.680 --> 23:11.806
We were close.

worker was too close.

a Gelumcaedus on it.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.765
It's been delayed.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.086
By What?

30:24.640 --> 30:25.641
A trial.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.970

reached a verdict.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.888
Who is that?
Breslau.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.008
The one who set us up.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.483
Constantine, I don't understand
why you would betray us.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.044
The Resistance
protected and supported you.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.843
What's her name?

31:05.960 --> 31:08.122
You will kill her.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.204
You are my friend

31:11.280 --> 31:14.807
and I do not wish to see you
suffer any more than you have to.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.564
You didn't know she was
working for the Royals,

31:18.640 --> 31:20.449
but you should have.

Thank you.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.361
Breslau betrayed us all.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.288
Would you prefer
one of us to do it?

31:44.360 --> 31:45.725
No.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.685

Ca va.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.081
And you are Sean Renard.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.924
And you're Claude Frenay.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.564
You saved my mother's life once.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.007
And I was well-rewarded.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.969
Glad to have you with us.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.244
Me too.

32:22.320 --> 32:25.449
We will begin as soon
as Tavitian arrives.

32:25.520 --> 32:28.410
Come! Food and
drink up at the house.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.925
NICK: Arrested twice.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.367
Salt Lake and New York City.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.089
Breaking and entering on both.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.844
Acquitted on both.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.321
Right. Lack of evidence.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.771
Couldn't find the goods.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.126
Not the case this time.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.724
You're a long way from your condo
in South Florida, Gregorek.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.968
Hear the weather's great
down there in the winter.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.405
Is that
your off-season?

32:55.480 --> 32:56.720
I like the sunshine.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.287
Who wouldn't, after a few
months in the sewer?

33:01.200 --> 33:02.884
You got a buyer down in Florida?

33:03.040 --> 33:05.202
Fence the stolen goods down
there, that how it works?

33:07.360 --> 33:09.840
Looks like Portland's
not your lucky town.

HANK: Two murder charges
we're gonna nail on you.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.481
And once we start looking into
robberies in other cities,

33:14.560 --> 33:16.289
we think we're gonna find
some more dead bodies.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.044
Make it easy on yourself.

33:18.760 --> 33:22.082
And maybe we can get the DA to take
the death penalty off the table.

You're wasting my time.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.364
This guy really
thinks he has a chance.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.124
Probably thinks we can't
tie the murders to him

33:49.200 --> 33:50.247
'cause of the way
they were killed.

I don't know what
this idiot's thinking.

at both crime scenes.

ever heard of a decapitare.

ROSALEE: I know
what it means.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.199
It's really,
really old-school.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.523
Latin for "Grimm,"
as in "he who decapitates."

34:29.600 --> 34:31.409
MONROE: One of those
nights, Nick?

34:31.480 --> 34:33.208

the first robbery was
reported in the Northwest.

Then on the 29th,
a Northwest robbery

35:10.520 --> 35:12.648
overlapped a break-in
in Homestead.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.688
Well, he can't be in
two places at once.

If there's another Gelumcaedus,
it's still down there.

Do you want me to come back?

35:18.960 --> 35:21.088
No. Let me cross-reference
these reports.

If I find anything,
I'll come over.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.003

you'll still be awake?
