00:12.012 --> 00:14.504
I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:28.070 --> 00:32.189
The land of Oz,
its capital - the Emerald City.

00:36.078 --> 00:39.412
Forever long altered by
the rule of the Tin Man.

00:39.456 --> 00:43.120
Imagination has brought
mankind through the Dark Ages

00:43.168 --> 00:46.002
to its present state
of civilization.

00:46.046 --> 00:50.165
But how could it have forgotten
something so invaluable?

01:32.009 --> 01:33.500
Can you fix it?

01:33.552 --> 01:34.633
It's up there.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.546
I can see the tension
in the joints.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.243
Can you grab me my hex-tool?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.127
Huh.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.495
Quite the weight.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.381
Great.

02:11.383 --> 02:12.542
Now, toss it on up.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.110
Are you sure
that's such a good idea?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.010
Come on.

02:15.012 --> 02:16.014
Trust me.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.045
Huh!

02:20.015 --> 02:21.015
Thank you!

02:26.730 --> 02:27.730
Trade you!

02:29.316 --> 02:30.932
Huh!

02:30.984 --> 02:31.986
Huh!

02:34.988 --> 02:37.025
Huh!

02:37.074 --> 02:38.074
Thank you.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.004
It's
beautiful, isn't it?

02:57.052 --> 02:59.135
All the parts
are working together.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.514
Emerald City can't do
without his Majesty Tin Man.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.799
What time is it?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.217
Right after six.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.103
The clocks never stop ticking.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.433
I've got to run back home.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.316
That's alright?

03:11.318 --> 03:12.316
Right?

03:12.359 --> 03:13.520
Of course, victoria.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.608
You need a hand with that?

03:14.653 --> 03:16.019
No, I think I've got it!

03:16.071 --> 03:17.437
Whoa!

03:17.489 --> 03:19.276
You shouldn't try
to carry so much.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.158
I know.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.118
I know.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.261
I'm just trying to be efficient.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.026
There's plenty of
efficiency to go around.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.490
You want to carry
that much again,

03:25.539 --> 03:27.246
we'll ask topside to
get a mule for you.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.656
For real?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.996
A mechanic mustn't
become a bother to topside.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.160
You know all this.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.212
Right.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.587
Keep it.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.588
Thank you!

03:36.633 --> 03:38.249
You spoil us, victoria.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.758
Never.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.090
You have an important
job here keeping us safe.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.926
I'm just thanking you.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.770
I'm back!

03:51.815 --> 03:52.931
Ah!

03:52.983 --> 03:54.599
Thank goodness.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.267
I'm starving!

03:56.319 --> 03:59.528
When I was brought here
you were skin and bones.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.155
What happened, Phadrig?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.862
victoria keeps bringing
that heavenly bread

04:03.910 --> 04:05.151
from the ovens.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.200
Who am I to argue?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.162
You're welcome, Mister Digg.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.920
With this your mustache
will reach all new heights.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.204
It's perfect.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.546
If the other munchkins
could see me now.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.134
Honored guests,

04:25.182 --> 04:28.300
please return to your
accommodations and rest well

04:28.351 --> 04:29.871
under the good care of
his Majesty, Tin Man.

04:29.895 --> 04:34.606
My girl, maybe tomorrow you
can let us all out of here.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.016
And put our
guards out of work?

04:37.068 --> 04:40.311
We all have our places in the
great engines, Mister Digg.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.729
Oh.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.818
I suppose so.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.708
Huh.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.131
Hello.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.963
Who are we here?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.127
Ooo, oo, oo!

05:06.056 --> 05:07.968
You want that banana?

05:12.354 --> 05:13.811
Take it.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.346
You want it, right?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.896
Hey!

05:19.945 --> 05:21.356
What are you doing?

05:21.404 --> 05:22.404
Let go!

05:25.700 --> 05:26.700
Whoa!

05:32.958 --> 05:36.451
I am Locasta, the
Witch of the North.

05:36.503 --> 05:40.247
You maintain the underground
steam engines of Emerald City.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.006
Would you consider
yourself a good worker?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.462
I am a good worker.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.797
Keeping the water running,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.133
the steam flowing,
the clocks ticking.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.015
As you say, the
gears never stop.

05:51.059 --> 05:55.099
Running day and night, through
the years, ever moving.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.854
The Emerald City never
does stop expanding

05:57.899 --> 06:00.642
and it will eventually
overtake us all.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.151
What do mean?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.313
His Majesty Tin Man grows
the city to care for us,

06:05.365 --> 06:06.526
not to overtake us.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.443
victoria, what is
the price we might pay

06:09.494 --> 06:11.406
for this rapid progress?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.662
Your work is coming to an end.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.164
What are you going to do?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.701
I fear this overwhelming
progress is dangerous.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.747
My magic cannot sway the Tin
Man or his mechanized city.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.257
But you, a cog in his machine,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.053
you may be able to turn
the Tin Man from his path

06:29.097 --> 06:30.759
before it's too late.

06:32.309 --> 06:36.098
The lions and Munchkins are
furious with the devastation

06:36.146 --> 06:39.139
this rapid progress has
brought to their homes.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.806
The elements of war are forming.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.101
Have you spoke
with his Majesty?

06:43.153 --> 06:43.939
Surely he would...

06:43.987 --> 06:45.273
I've tried.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.190
You cannot remain hidden
underground any longer.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.903
But this is my place.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.158
It's where I belong.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.738
Listen to me, victoria.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.700
Find the heart to face
Tin Man or else the people

06:55.749 --> 06:59.834
you work so hard for, the people
you care for, will perish.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.581
Hey!

07:01.630 --> 07:02.630
Wait!

07:03.590 --> 07:04.590
Ah!

07:30.241 --> 07:31.344
You cannot remain

07:31.368 --> 07:34.156
hidden underground any longer.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.672
You may be able to turn
the Tin Man from his path.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.332
The elements of war are forming.

07:49.970 --> 07:54.055
Find the heart to face Tin
Man before it's too late.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.058
Whoa!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.485
Mr Digg.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.686
Psst, Mr Digg.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.940
victoria?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.178
Do you
still want to leave?

08:14.202 --> 08:15.067
Leave?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.236
Am I dreaming?

08:17.414 --> 08:19.246
No, no, no, no.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.656
This is real!

08:20.709 --> 08:23.668
Why such a sudden
change of heart?

08:23.712 --> 08:26.955
Last night, I was visited
by the Witch of the North.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.124
She told me, oh, so
many of things and...

08:29.175 --> 08:32.964
Oh, you must be
dreaming, my girl.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.379
I'm serious.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.515
She said the Emerald
City could fall into war!

08:37.558 --> 08:38.765
Heh, heh, heh.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.642
If that's true then
we'll finally be free

08:40.687 --> 08:41.928
from these dungeons!

08:41.980 --> 08:43.812
But then everything
will fall out of place.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.314
It'll be chaos!

08:45.358 --> 08:47.645
There was order before
his Majesty Tinkle Bucket

08:47.694 --> 08:50.027
and Emerald City will
return to order after him.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.983
Tin Man has improved Oz.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.489
Worked hard to care for us.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.990
For us?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.743
You don't know the first thing
about us, Oz, or anything!

08:57.787 --> 09:00.746
You've never even
been up topside.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.826
Oh, victoria.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.038
We're going topside.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.043
I need to see it for myself.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.705
The Munchkins, lions, all of Oz.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.468
We really should not
bother those lions.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.590
Besides them and the
Munchkins live far

09:18.641 --> 09:21.224
outside the Emerald City walls.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.224
I can't stay here, Phadrig.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.640
Not when there could be
problems only I can fix.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.604
If you're going to
meet the Munchkins,

09:29.652 --> 09:33.771
I'll be your escort as an
official member of the guild!

09:36.951 --> 09:39.568
Now, why would
the Witch decide

09:39.621 --> 09:41.954
to call upon you specifically?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.035
If the Witch believes
victoria to hold

09:44.084 --> 09:46.701
some sway over the
Tin Man, she must.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.869
Let's go.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.628
Her flying monkeys
could still be around.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.005
The monkeys were here?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.211
Nevermind that.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.019
I'm surprised the guards
haven't barked at us

09:55.053 --> 09:56.669
for disturbing their naps.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.758
Just get to it already!

10:03.686 --> 10:05.052
Now hurry.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.518
While the guards
are still asleep.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.022
They're unconscious.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.400
I can't see them falling
asleep that way naturally.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.810
I didn't hurt them.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.444
Gave them loaves
of bread at that.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.151
Never you mind, my girl.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.735
Can you get us out?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.699
These pipes bring
water to homes

10:23.748 --> 10:25.330
all over the Emerald City.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.707
They'll take us to topside.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.868
Well, we all sure
could use a bath.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.661
Can one of you boost me?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.921
Are you sure
that's such a good...

10:32.966 --> 10:33.752
Come on.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.800
Trust me.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.004
You're taller.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.426
Right, okay.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.760
One.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.096
Three!

10:45.145 --> 10:46.602
Heh.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.558
Quite the weight.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.606
Phadrig.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.475
I know a place
where we'll be safe.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.434
Let's go quietly.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.482
Oh!

11:34.360 --> 11:35.646
Hey, aren't you?

11:36.946 --> 11:40.030
Halt, in the name of
his Majesty Tin Man!

11:42.994 --> 11:44.326
Wait!

11:47.332 --> 11:48.493
I

11:48.541 --> 11:49.452
can't

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
keep.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.589
Stop!

12:06.309 --> 12:08.972
In the name of
the Tin Man, stop!

12:29.082 --> 12:29.868
Follow it!

12:29.916 --> 12:31.703
Don't let them escape.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.088
They're gone?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.545
It sounds like it.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.884
Is that you, isn't it?

12:49.936 --> 12:50.936
Phadrig?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.395
In the flesh.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.148
What's left of it.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.059
Where've you been?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.523
There were so many rumors.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.812
So much gossip.

13:02.991 --> 13:06.701
Some of it was true,
I'm sure, Candice.

13:06.744 --> 13:10.954
I dared to speak up and received
first class accommodations

13:10.999 --> 13:12.285
in the dungeons.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.662
What of Alondra?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.255
It's been decades, Phadrig.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.256
Your wife died ages ago.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.636
When you left, well,
she was never the same.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.797
And what of my boys?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.034
Last I
heard, they were off

13:29.058 --> 13:32.176
on some grand adventure
to find their father.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.969
A good 16 years ago.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.981
Candice, we need your
help escaping Emerald City.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.687
I can't help yae.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.478
Tin Man's got eyes everywhere.

13:41.529 --> 13:46.069
May we use your wagon
just once again, Candice?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.904
Didn't yae learn anythin'?

13:47.952 --> 13:50.569
Bein' a revolutionary
just gets yae locked up!

13:50.621 --> 13:53.739
Even your brother Oz has
gone and left Emerald City!

13:53.791 --> 13:55.783
Oz is your brother?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.292
You never mentioned this.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.499
Yes, yes, yes, I know.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.290
Oz, the Great and Powerful.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.131
Oz, the former Ruler
of Emerald City.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.671
Et cetera, et cetera et cetera.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.056
The younger brother's
curse, I'm afraid.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.684
To always be lost in your
older brother's shadow.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.265
Wow.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.667
The Wizard would know why the
lions and munchkins are upset.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.932
Where could we find him?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.475
Oh, that's easy.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.860
Find the munchkins
an' yae'll find Oz.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.067
And where are the munchkins?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.651
No one knows.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.032
Huh?

14:29.077 --> 14:31.364
Oh, I'm playin'
with yae, girlie.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.244
They're in the
forest to the east.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.075
Hidden.

14:34.123 --> 14:34.909
Hidin'.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.164
Waitin'.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.122
What is Oscar doing
with the munchkins?

14:39.170 --> 14:42.254
Think he realized t'wasn't
safe 'ere and 'e was right!

14:42.298 --> 14:45.132
Can you help us
to the Munchkins?

14:49.097 --> 14:50.713
Well, I can get yae
all past the gates

14:50.765 --> 14:54.384
but the fringe of the
forest is as far I go.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.017
Can't spend a
day in the country

14:56.062 --> 14:58.805
without Tin Man
pulling your leash.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.557
Thank you, Candice.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.271
Oh, don't thank me yet.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.685
Yae're in for it.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.043
Hold.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.703
Where are you bound for?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.418
Well, gotta pick up some supplies
outta the city, don't I?

15:25.466 --> 15:27.298
Got some crates,
an' plenty 'o space

15:27.343 --> 15:28.834
to bring back goods, yeah?

15:32.598 --> 15:33.598
Oh!

15:34.517 --> 15:35.517
Hmm.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.635
Anything to declare?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.224
Ehm.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.834
Carry on.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.032
Oi, wassat!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.620
I've done nothin' wrong.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.956
Get that beast outta my wagon!

16:46.005 --> 16:47.496
Huh!

16:47.548 --> 16:51.667
Hey, help me get this
beast under control!

16:51.719 --> 16:52.835
Pull!

16:52.887 --> 16:55.095
What's wrong with the thing?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.380
Go on!

16:56.432 --> 16:59.175
Next time clean
your scraps better!

17:10.238 --> 17:11.023
All clear.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.071
Yae alright?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.653
Gromit's a bit unglued.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.201
I didn't think
about warning yae

17:18.246 --> 17:19.907
about the kalidahs, friend.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.164
They're obsessed with munchkins.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.743
Gobble 'em down, they do.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.079
Kalidahs?

17:25.127 --> 17:27.915
When did they get kalidahs?

17:49.986 --> 17:52.353
This is progress?

17:53.698 --> 17:54.905
Look up ahead!

17:54.949 --> 17:55.949
The forest!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.787
The leaves.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.203
These are trees?

18:15.678 --> 18:18.295
He's withered
up the land, let it age

18:18.347 --> 18:20.714
to keep Emerald City running.

18:40.661 --> 18:44.120
We thank you
for the help, Candice.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.781
Who's to say what
would have happened

18:45.833 --> 18:49.873
if you hadn't pulled
us off the streets.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.163
My guess, a round trip to
an all too familiar cell.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.298
What're ol' friends for, aye?

19:02.350 --> 19:03.350
Farewell!

19:08.898 --> 19:11.481
Now, let's
go find the munchkins.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.525
victoria?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.234
victoria?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.914
Your Majesty!

19:28.959 --> 19:30.245
Speak.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.455
Yes, Your Majesty.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.416
Prisoners have escaped
from the dungeons.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.922
No one in our
dungeons is a prisoner.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.583
Everyone is an
honored guest below.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.628
Of course, Your Majesty.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.512
I mean to say that
our honored guests

19:42.556 --> 19:45.799
have pre-maturely ended
their stays in the dungeons.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.058
Who?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.720
Phadrig Digg, Gromit
the munchkin technician

19:49.772 --> 19:53.766
and a girl mechanic from
beneath, victoria Wright.

19:53.818 --> 19:54.683
When?

19:54.735 --> 19:57.102
Two hours ago, Your Majesty.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.146
Highly probable
our guests have left

19:59.198 --> 20:01.235
the safety of the city walls.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.900
But, Your Majesty, the
gates are under heavy guard.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.069
No one has...

20:05.121 --> 20:06.487
Silence,
Sir Blackburn.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.766
Yes, Your Majesty.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.622
Find these
guests and return them

20:09.667 --> 20:11.750
to their homes for their safety.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.088
I suspect they
traveled eastward.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.590
Bring with you help.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.469
We must ensure no one is
neglected from our care.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.971
As you wish.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.710
What's this?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.345
A human?

21:05.389 --> 21:08.052
Does this girl
know she is in our forest?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.557
Must not.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.185
What's it wearing?

21:12.229 --> 21:13.561
Not fur.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.893
Smells ripe.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.729
Smells like meat.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.236
Smells good to me.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.153
Aahh!

21:30.206 --> 21:31.206
victoria!

21:39.423 --> 21:41.961
The Cowardly Lion?

21:43.385 --> 21:45.092
Don't inflate his ego.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.799
That's Magnus.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.260
The Cowardly Lion is his father.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.425
No more talking.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.469
Oh!

23:07.303 --> 23:10.592
Girl will be good
meal for pride.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.596
Why share with pride?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.598
Pride did not catch girl.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.599
I did.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.180
We hunt for the pack, Lucilia.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.393
We can bring
scraps back to pride.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.683
Hunters get the best meat.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.816
Lucilia!

23:23.861 --> 23:25.602
Meat is for the pack!

23:41.670 --> 23:42.831
Yield.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.837
No, Magnus, you yield.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.088
You're lucky, Lucilia.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.050
If you were not my mate, I
would not tolerate your lip.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.512
But my lip is
why you chose me.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
So I did.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.683
Otho, carry girl to the pack.

24:01.732 --> 24:02.597
Lucilia.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.437
We go and meet the machines.

24:04.485 --> 24:05.896
But Magnus, I..

24:20.668 --> 24:23.126
Magnus needs me by his side,

24:23.170 --> 24:24.661
not carry meat.

24:24.713 --> 24:25.999
There she is!

24:26.048 --> 24:27.048
Uh, hullo.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.257
Keep walking.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.669
Or the pride will
eat well tonight.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.054
See here, Mister, ah, Lion.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.719
Otho!

24:37.768 --> 24:39.100
Remember it.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.601
Quite right.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.640
Well, then, see here Mister
Otho, you have our friend there

24:45.943 --> 24:48.356
and we must insist you
give her back to us.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.404
Insist?

24:50.614 --> 24:54.574
Little men, you do not
insist anything of a lion.

24:55.744 --> 24:56.825
Little?

24:56.870 --> 24:59.112
Who are you calling
little, lion?

25:00.165 --> 25:03.283
All you Munchkins are alike.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.453
You'll never reach the
height of us lions,

25:06.505 --> 25:11.091
descendants of the Cowardly
Lion, he who has no fear.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.722
Well, then why are
you letting the machines

25:17.766 --> 25:19.678
just mow down the forest?

25:19.727 --> 25:23.016
I did not run from the fight!

25:23.063 --> 25:24.349
But we must eat.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.233
I see.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.691
Your pride fights
the Emerald City, eh?

25:31.739 --> 25:34.197
She is chosen by the
Witch of the North

25:34.241 --> 25:36.107
to defeat the Tin Man.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.028
Girl was taken so easily.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.663
How is one so small
to defeat Tin Man?

25:42.708 --> 25:44.074
With help.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.062
We need to find the
Munchkins here in the forest.

25:46.086 --> 25:50.080
Munchkins in the forest
smell like girl does.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.998
Grime and smoke.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.132
You know of them?

25:53.177 --> 25:55.089
Know of them?

25:55.137 --> 25:59.347
The Munchkins live in the
forest because we allow them to.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.099
Could you take us to them?

26:02.144 --> 26:05.603
No, I must take girl to pride.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.980
We can make it
worth your while.

26:08.025 --> 26:12.941
What does man have that
I want besides to eat him?

26:12.988 --> 26:16.607
Well, how about we
take the girl to the pack

26:16.658 --> 26:19.742
and you point us in the
direction of the Munchkins?

26:19.787 --> 26:21.744
But girl is important.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.865
Not so important.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.375
We need to find the Munchkins.

26:29.755 --> 26:33.874
Then you can go join the
fight against the machines.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.175
Girl brought to pride.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.306
Little men to Munchkins.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.350
Exactly.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.676
Hmpf.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.060
Deal.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.221
Walk that way.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.013
You'll find pride.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.399
Walk further, find Munchkins.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.442
Oh, he fell for that?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.903
Oh, it's just a
matter of determining

26:58.951 --> 27:02.661
what he wanted more,
food or a fight.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.242
Can I stop playing
dead now, Mr Digg?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.121
Of course.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.498
Ha, ha!

27:07.543 --> 27:10.707
Now, let's hightail it
before the furry fellow

27:10.754 --> 27:12.666
comes back now.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.331
Mr Digg, he pointed
this way didn't he?

27:15.384 --> 27:17.341
No, no, no,
lions and Munchkins

27:17.386 --> 27:19.503
would never live close together.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.591
Quite the opposite.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.380
The exact opposite.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.845
Now, let's go find my people.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.401
Maybe that lion wasn't lying.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.284
Uproarious.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.906
Gromit, don't you have any idea

27:46.165 --> 27:47.781
Do you smell smoke?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.790
Unfortunately.

27:49.835 --> 27:50.791
Not me!

27:50.836 --> 27:51.836
Come on.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.634
Huh!

28:03.015 --> 28:06.349
Who would build
something so barbaric?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.679
We would!

28:07.728 --> 28:08.728
Look!

28:17.613 --> 28:21.903
It's been years since
I've seen real homes.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.242
They're so small.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.076
I know.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.080
And cramped.

28:30.125 --> 28:30.911
I know.

28:30.959 --> 28:31.959
And ours.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.565
Now, give me one reason why
we shouldn't put a few holes

28:35.589 --> 28:37.831
in you and then knock
you into that ditch.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.670
Please don't have a good reason.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.380
Wait, I'm a Munchkin too.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.635
You can't...

28:42.679 --> 28:44.341
Oh, listen to the
little guy, Heflin.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.848
What manner of Munchkins
are you to disregard customs,

28:47.893 --> 28:48.929
to insult, threaten...

28:48.977 --> 28:50.263
Definitely one of us.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.428
Enough!

28:51.480 --> 28:53.688
I asked you a question
and I'm getting

28:53.732 --> 28:55.940
really impatient
for an answer here.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.646
We're looking for Oz.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.060
You looked around, girl?

28:59.112 --> 29:00.398
We're in Oz.

29:00.447 --> 29:01.938
Smell that fresh air?

29:01.990 --> 29:03.481
Oz air.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.614
The trees?

29:04.660 --> 29:05.867
Oz trees.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.949
No, no, no, not
the land of Oz.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.863
The Wizard, Oscar Digg.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.207
My brother.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.368
He has a brother?

29:14.419 --> 29:15.535
Yes he does.

29:23.804 --> 29:24.920
You a traitor?

29:24.972 --> 29:26.634
Only to the Tin Man.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.174
Okay, anyone who
betrays the Tin Man

29:29.226 --> 29:31.513
must be a friend of
the Munchkins, right?

29:31.561 --> 29:32.561
Right.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.890
Exactly.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.602
Come, come, before the
sun sets on us now.

29:36.650 --> 29:40.735
You don't want to see what
comes out in the dark.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.731
Wait, what are you...

29:51.415 --> 29:53.156
How far?

29:53.208 --> 29:54.665
Oh, you'll know.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.460
Huh, chow down!

30:10.225 --> 30:12.763
How is it there in Emerald City?

30:12.811 --> 30:13.847
It's great.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.431
Everyone is taken care of.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.016
Everyday the city progresses.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.306
Taken care of.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.270
Huh, that's a way to put it.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.278
Then why don't the Munchkins
come join Emerald City?

30:23.322 --> 30:24.938
The Emerald City's
got nothing for us.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.903
But you could do so much
more with Tin Man's help.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.238
No help of Tinkle Bucket
ever amount to anything

30:30.287 --> 30:32.449
but broken buttons and bearings.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.865
We're better off without any
Witch, Wizard, or Winkie king.

30:35.917 --> 30:39.627
Where is my brother,
the great Wizard?

30:39.671 --> 30:42.539
Hasn't gone and
disappeared, right?

30:43.717 --> 30:45.208
Ha, ha.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.003
I'm sorry but I don't know
nor have any business knowing.

30:48.055 --> 30:49.466
Sure you should know.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.096
Lend an ear to one another.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.929
If you met Tin Man, Emerald
City would truly become

30:53.977 --> 30:55.218
a home for all.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.511
I'm for certain.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.850
Tin Bucket hung up his
ear away with his heart.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.481
No one is listening!

31:00.525 --> 31:01.525
Argh!

31:02.861 --> 31:03.861
vic!

31:12.496 --> 31:13.496
victoria!

31:14.289 --> 31:16.246
I'm going to help them.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.624
I'm going to help them see
that we can all be a part

31:18.668 --> 31:19.875
of Emerald City.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.663
What's this help
you're thinking of?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.671
I'm going to his
Majesty Tin Man.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.298
That's mad!

31:26.343 --> 31:28.005
Maybe the Munchkins
don't understand

31:28.053 --> 31:30.966
his Majesty's words, but I do.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.098
He'll understand us too and
he knows that the Munchkins

31:34.142 --> 31:36.350
are needed in Emerald City.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.765
Just go, walk in.

31:39.940 --> 31:40.940
And talk?

31:49.324 --> 31:50.815
Any sign of them?

31:52.619 --> 31:54.827
Sir Blackburn!

31:55.956 --> 31:56.992
Seize them!

31:59.126 --> 32:00.492
Please!

32:00.544 --> 32:02.355
This could be the difference
between us and war!

32:02.379 --> 32:03.379
War?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.007
Stand down.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.550
Sir Blackburn.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.881
Why won't his Majesty Tin
Man accept the Munchkins

32:11.930 --> 32:13.137
into the Emerald City?

32:13.181 --> 32:14.547
His Majesty has
long determined

32:14.599 --> 32:18.058
that the Munchkins
belong outside the walls.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.641
Just as you belong inside them.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.731
Come home, Miss victoria Wright.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.233
His Majesty Tin Man
is much more forgiving

32:26.278 --> 32:27.359
than the Munchkins.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.895
If he could speak with them.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.405
They do not change, holding
onto their outdated beliefs

32:31.450 --> 32:32.611
in magic.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.026
They do not share our
Emerald City values.

32:35.078 --> 32:38.412
They do not have a place
in Tin Man's final vision.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.119
No place for magic?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.908
Have you taken a look around?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.826
You're in the land of Oz!

32:43.879 --> 32:45.996
We have no use for magic.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.084
Soon Tin Man will
progress the Emerald City

32:48.133 --> 32:49.669
across of all Oz.

32:49.718 --> 32:53.837
Our technological advances
have bettered countless lives.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.345
I'll return, if I
can speak with Tin Man.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.393
Of course.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.099
I said I will return.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.764
Not them!

33:04.816 --> 33:07.934
Whether they will be as
cooperative cannot be ascertained.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.228
Well, then I'm not going!

33:13.116 --> 33:14.948
The munchkins have
indoctrinated you

33:14.993 --> 33:16.859
with their silly beliefs.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.448
We will not allow
the selfishness

33:18.497 --> 33:20.989
of the few to
inhibit our progress.

33:21.875 --> 33:22.875
victoria!

33:50.737 --> 33:52.023
Shoot them!

33:53.073 --> 33:54.073
Ahh!

34:03.458 --> 34:05.370
Are you the
leader of this pack?

34:05.418 --> 34:06.418
I am.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.786
To attack one of your own.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.500
You are not fit to be a general.

34:10.549 --> 34:14.918
To think the wild woods
have actually made you soft.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.518
Kilimanjaro.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.774
Kilimanjaro, I need you to
contact the Witch of the North!

34:29.818 --> 34:31.605
I need her right away.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.307
What is it?

35:03.351 --> 35:05.764
Was it you that
reached out to victoria?

35:05.812 --> 35:06.893
Yes.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.145
That was me.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.875
Are you sure
now is the right time?

35:09.899 --> 35:11.106
I'm sure.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.938
How much time do
you think we have?

35:12.986 --> 35:15.569
She is much bigger than
the last time you saw her.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.276
Still,
she is far too young

35:17.324 --> 35:19.156
with so much more to learn.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.786
Only the Scarecrow will know
how to handle the Tin Man.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.447
I've trusted many
wise men over time

35:26.499 --> 35:28.866
and that has brought us here.

35:30.754 --> 35:34.168
Even after all this time,
you still keep searching?

35:34.215 --> 35:36.207
He must be in Emerald City.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.466
He must.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.030
Neither of us can
enter the city safely.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.573
With your
flying monkeys I could...

35:40.597 --> 35:41.838
We've been through this.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.631
It will be
different this time!

35:43.683 --> 35:45.174
Because of victoria.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.183
Someone after our time.

35:47.228 --> 35:50.141
The one we have
been waiting for.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.977
Phadrig is still with her.

35:52.025 --> 35:54.187
And I sense victoria
has already learnt much

35:54.235 --> 35:57.945
about this world, out beyond
the small walls of her dungeon.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.072
Does she
know of Scarecrow?

36:00.116 --> 36:03.075
If
Phadrig has told her.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.660
I must be going.

36:05.705 --> 36:06.570
Farewell.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.580
Farewell, Wizard of Oz.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.678
Well, hear, the
noise has stopped.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.608
Help, help!

36:41.574 --> 36:42.574
Help!

36:44.327 --> 36:45.327
Help!

36:51.251 --> 36:53.083
I have you!

36:56.047 --> 36:57.538
Oscar, is that you?

36:58.842 --> 37:00.424
Phadrig.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.004
You've lose weight!

37:02.053 --> 37:04.010
You've lost your hair!

37:06.015 --> 37:07.256
Phadrig!

37:07.308 --> 37:08.308
Oscar!

37:11.980 --> 37:12.766
Oz?

37:12.814 --> 37:15.022
The great Wizard?

37:15.066 --> 37:15.977
We need your help.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.141
Tin Man's soldiers.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.229
Blackburn.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.109
What's he doing here?

37:26.161 --> 37:27.493
Relax, brother.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.493
Please.

37:28.538 --> 37:30.029
Let us talk inside.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.247
Your Majesty.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.797
Speak.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.878
Sir Blackburn sends
me, Your Majesty.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.542
We have a problem in the east.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.338
The lions, they're attacking.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.551
The cats have turned feral.

37:48.600 --> 37:53.015
Tell Sir Blackburn I will
be joining him on the field.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.974
Ready my allies.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.023
It is time.

38:01.488 --> 38:02.945
By
Cheeriobed's beard!

38:02.989 --> 38:04.355
What's going on?

38:04.407 --> 38:05.989
Hello, hairball.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.866
How are you Puffball?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.698
Please excuse our intrusion.

38:09.746 --> 38:12.659
We have come to discuss
our dire situation.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.868
Yes.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.409
Tin Man cannot be
tolerated any longer.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.828
We lions have long known
that Tin Man's heart

38:18.880 --> 38:21.839
did not extend far, but
to see him toss aside

38:21.883 --> 38:24.671
one of his own, it reeks.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.008
Tin Man must be dealt
with, but mindless fighting

38:28.056 --> 38:30.514
will only lead to
losses on both sides.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.844
We've tried reasoning.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.509
The girl's tried reasoning.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.561
It's no use.

38:35.980 --> 38:39.644
Tin Man believes the
more Emerald City grows,

38:39.692 --> 38:43.060
the more he controls, the more
people, the more resources,

38:43.112 --> 38:46.071
the closer he'll get
to saving his wife

38:46.115 --> 38:49.404
and ensuring nothing like
it happens ever again.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.238
His wife?

38:50.286 --> 38:51.367
He had a wife?

38:51.412 --> 38:52.778
That metal man?

38:52.831 --> 38:55.574
He was not always made of tin.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.585
You see, before the Tin
Man, there was merely a man.

39:01.047 --> 39:04.882
Well, actually a Munchkin,
named Nick Chopper the woodsman.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.335
He fell in love with a servant

39:07.387 --> 39:11.631
of the Wicked Witch of the East,
a Munchkin girl Nimee Amee.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.347
The Wicked Witch was none too
pleased at Nick's advances.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.978
She bewitched his
axe and the next day

39:18.022 --> 39:21.265
the enchanted axe
cut off Nick's leg.

39:21.317 --> 39:22.853
Driven, Nick continued.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.609
But so did the curse.

39:24.654 --> 39:27.237
With every hack, he lost a limb.

39:27.282 --> 39:30.821
With every slash, he
lost a piece of himself.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.488
The enchanted axe's final
blow was to the only area

39:34.539 --> 39:36.326
not replaced by tin.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.490
His own heart.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.415
The tinsmith then replaced
every part of Nick

39:41.462 --> 39:44.079
until only the Tin Man remained.

39:44.132 --> 39:48.342
But there was no heart and
a marriage without heart

39:48.386 --> 39:51.595
is one without love
and doomed to fail.

39:53.266 --> 39:57.101
Years passed and he was
alone, but he did not care.

39:57.145 --> 40:00.889
The strong and heartless
machine just kept chopping.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.772
The emptiness in his chest

40:02.817 --> 40:05.855
and a sudden storm
froze him in time.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.688
Until a young girl
found his can of oil

40:09.741 --> 40:13.360
and rescued him from
his rusted tin prison.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.619
Together, they went
on great adventures,

40:15.663 --> 40:19.156
and, in time, he even
received a new heart.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.354
After the death of the
witch, he was even asked

40:22.378 --> 40:24.586
to run a kingdom for a time.

40:24.631 --> 40:28.500
The Winkie Kingdom enjoyed a
time of peace under his reign.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.339
But the more he spent
bettering the Winkie's lives,

40:31.387 --> 40:33.470
the more he thought
of his other life

40:33.514 --> 40:35.221
when he was a Munchkin.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.223
And when he was in love.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.019
When he could no longer
live with the unknown,

40:41.064 --> 40:45.024
he left, determined
to discover her fate.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.651
Near the southern
border he found Nimee

40:47.695 --> 40:50.403
living out her final days.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.657
The enchantment placed
on the land by Lurline,

40:53.701 --> 40:57.411
Queen of the Fairies,
prevented Ozians from aging,

40:57.455 --> 40:58.821
but it was fading.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.991
Under the newfound
pain of heartbreak,

41:02.043 --> 41:04.956
the Tin Man swore
he would save Nimee

41:05.004 --> 41:06.495
at any cost.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.005
He turned to magic, but the
good witches were unable

41:09.050 --> 41:11.588
to reverse time's
effect on Nimee.

41:11.636 --> 41:15.425
He turned his sights
to the Emerald City.

41:15.473 --> 41:19.683
The Emerald City welcomed the
heroic Tin Man with open arms.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.344
He began to build the
steam engines of Oz

41:22.397 --> 41:24.684
to save his true love.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.314
His work became his obsession.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.396
The Tin Man blindly
followed his heart

41:28.444 --> 41:31.152
and, with the industrial
growth of the Emerald City,

41:31.197 --> 41:33.484
everything changed.

41:33.533 --> 41:34.533
As did he.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.530
He blamed the Munchkins
for taking Nimee

41:37.578 --> 41:38.739
away from the magic.

41:38.788 --> 41:41.405
He blamed the magic
for failing Nimee.

41:41.457 --> 41:45.076
And, eventually, he
blamed his own heart

41:45.128 --> 41:47.165
so he hung it up forever.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.177
But Tin Man wanted a
world without suffering.

41:55.221 --> 41:57.713
And he sacrificed
his heart to do so.

41:57.765 --> 42:01.975
Soon he will do away with
magic and anyone in his way.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.558
We need to take
back Emerald City now

42:04.605 --> 42:08.019
before all the magic in Oz
is completely destroyed.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.308
This is mad!

42:09.360 --> 42:12.478
Tin Man has not sat
idle on his throne.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.318
We know the results of
a head on confrontation.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.359
Imprisoned in Emerald
City is the Scarecrow.

42:18.411 --> 42:22.200
But once freed, I believe he
can get through to the Tin Man.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.205
Scarecrow has
failed us already.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.367
He lost his head and
cost us the city.

42:26.419 --> 42:28.376
It will be
different this time.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.253
It will be different!

42:31.716 --> 42:33.708
We can fix this by ourselves.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.717
We can do this
without Scarecrow.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.253
Without feeling afraid.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.672
Without waiting any longer.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.932
We can progress on our own.

42:43.603 --> 42:47.438
Then let us progress
to the battlefield.

42:47.482 --> 42:49.348
The lions will
be the vanguard.

42:49.400 --> 42:53.519
We'll create a diversion to
lure him away from the walls.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.483
Take the north and south
sides of the forest edge.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.150
When Tin Man splits his forces,

43:00.203 --> 43:01.865
the Munchkins will
come in the air,

43:01.913 --> 43:03.950
cutting straight
through their lines.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.990
Tin Man should be
commanding from the back.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.328
Obviously.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.584
Too cowardly to fight
and too foolish to hide.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.370
There should be seven
brigades in total.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.708
Corner each one off.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.589
Not even you can take
them all at once.

43:14.634 --> 43:17.047
A Munchkin
looking over a lion?

43:17.095 --> 43:18.461
Ha, ha.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.157
Once we break their
line go right for Tin Man.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.137
We'll cover you.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.549
Don't get left behind.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.763
Let's go Munchspendables!

43:27.939 --> 43:29.083
I'm
right behind you.

43:29.107 --> 43:30.314
victoria.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.144
Listen.

43:31.192 --> 43:32.728
No.

43:32.777 --> 43:36.145
I thought Tin Man would listen,
but I just got Gromit hurt,

43:36.197 --> 43:38.655
and put you in danger.

43:38.699 --> 43:42.113
No one else is
going to get hurt.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.369
Are you hearing yourself?

43:48.668 --> 43:49.668
Oh blast!

44:05.434 --> 44:06.675
Come on!

44:06.727 --> 44:10.016
We don't know how
much time we have.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.430
Wait the...

44:11.482 --> 44:12.268
Heflin!

44:12.316 --> 44:13.316
No!

44:15.027 --> 44:16.518
That isn't funny!

44:16.571 --> 44:17.732
Maybe to you!

44:17.780 --> 44:18.645
Ha, ha!

44:18.698 --> 44:20.155
Come on Munchkins.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.468
Time for war!

45:28.601 --> 45:30.263
Attention!

45:30.311 --> 45:31.768
Form ranks!

45:31.812 --> 45:32.812
March left!

46:41.007 --> 46:42.748
- Huh?
- Erm.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
Huh?

46:46.012 --> 46:47.012
Huh.

46:51.892 --> 46:52.848
Oh!

46:52.893 --> 46:53.893
Ahh!

46:57.690 --> 46:59.226
- Ah!
- Ahh!

46:59.275 --> 47:00.732
Oh!

47:00.776 --> 47:01.892
Wait!

47:01.944 --> 47:03.105
Come back here!

47:04.280 --> 47:05.987
Oh!

47:06.032 --> 47:07.032
Ahh!

47:08.534 --> 47:09.775
Ah!

47:39.565 --> 47:40.601
Ho!

47:40.649 --> 47:41.765
Ow!

47:41.817 --> 47:42.933
Uhh!

48:07.051 --> 48:10.260
That there is an
electrolaser rifle.

48:10.304 --> 48:11.465
Crank and aim.

48:11.514 --> 48:13.130
Tilt it little
above your target.

48:13.182 --> 48:15.265
The electricity will arc down.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.516
Better get a good handle.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.394
Or should I go put on
some rubber gloves?

48:19.438 --> 48:20.804
Ha, ha, ha!

48:20.856 --> 48:22.017
You'll be fine.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.480
If anything Noomi's
got you covered.

48:25.528 --> 48:27.565
Let's go Munchspendables!

48:28.906 --> 48:30.693
All aircraft report.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.403
We're heading in!

48:32.451 --> 48:34.317
Let's see what you got!

48:39.375 --> 48:40.456
Circle them in.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.037
Blast'em right out!

49:13.367 --> 49:15.734
Signal stage two.

49:24.837 --> 49:25.837
Ahhh!

49:47.651 --> 49:48.858
Magnus!

49:48.903 --> 49:49.903
Look!

50:24.647 --> 50:25.933
Kemp, move it!

50:27.525 --> 50:29.312
Wait one.

50:39.495 --> 50:40.326
Below you.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.371
victoria!

50:50.089 --> 50:51.796
Attention!

50:51.840 --> 50:53.081
Forward, march!

51:11.360 --> 51:12.360
Ah!

52:20.971 --> 52:22.928
Wait, come on.

53:08.227 --> 53:09.227
Oh!

53:11.397 --> 53:12.397
Uh!

53:13.107 --> 53:14.107
Ahh!

53:18.487 --> 53:19.487
Oh!

53:31.125 --> 53:32.125
Ruh!

53:39.466 --> 53:41.799
Guards, tend to the others.

53:41.844 --> 53:45.087
I will take care of
little Maggie here.

53:47.641 --> 53:49.382
What ails you so?

53:49.435 --> 53:52.098
What brings you to
threaten our prosperity?

53:52.146 --> 53:54.012
What twisted
prosperity demands

53:54.064 --> 53:57.523
that your dispose of
even one of your own?

53:58.527 --> 53:59.527
Hmm.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.208
Uh!

55:31.286 --> 55:32.286
Ahh!

56:32.806 --> 56:35.264
Said I'd be looking over ya!

56:48.864 --> 56:49.864
- Ho!
- Uh!

56:52.826 --> 56:55.284
Why fight any further?

56:55.329 --> 56:56.661
For our hope!

57:00.876 --> 57:02.583
Rar!

57:02.628 --> 57:04.836
For the faith placed in us!

57:09.259 --> 57:11.876
For the people we love!

57:30.656 --> 57:34.900
So proud to stand as
leaders yet you tremble.

57:34.952 --> 57:38.320
Afraid when you fail your
people that you will have

57:38.372 --> 57:41.410
to face the fact
you failed yourself.

57:42.376 --> 57:43.617
So you fight.

57:43.669 --> 57:46.036
So you can hold onto your image.

57:46.088 --> 57:50.207
So you can hide from the
fact that you are no leader.

58:05.983 --> 58:08.566
I will rid Oz of magic, of you,

58:09.778 --> 58:12.691
of anything that
threatens its beauty.

58:13.949 --> 58:17.488
Not for my people, not
for me, but for love.

59:00.162 --> 59:02.245
Quite a mess we have here.

59:02.289 --> 59:04.747
What else could I have done?

59:17.929 --> 59:19.591
We've come to help.

59:39.159 --> 59:43.153
We'll keep the Tin Man's army
distracted, but make haste!

59:43.205 --> 59:44.321
Thank you!

59:44.372 --> 59:45.372
Thank you!

59:46.750 --> 59:49.020
Take what you have
learned, find the Scarecrow

59:49.044 --> 59:51.411
and bring an end to this war.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:43.050
The Scarecrow is kept in a
secret chamber somewhere here.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.634
How can you be so sure?

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:48.097
He did rule the
Emerald City before.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.145
Remember?

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.101
Hmm.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:56.944
Hmm.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780
Oh, well.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.733
Hmm.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.117
Hmm.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.122
Watcha' looking at?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.417
The key lies together with love.

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.961
Why's that written there?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:24.800
Hmm.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.760
That's a new addition.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.489
It's the Great
Steam Engines of Oz.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.525
Scarecrow must be in there.

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:47.284
I'm afraid you're
probably right.

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.195
We can't go in there.

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.783
It's blistering!

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.619
What else are
we suppose to do?

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.283
No time for back up.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:00.547
Well, 18 years in a dungeon

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:03.084
didn't prepare me to face this.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.253
Mr Digg, we can do this.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.426
Everyone is trusting in us.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:14.346
Together we can
brave through this.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.809
Where's all that spirit you have

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.521
when I bring you your bread?

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.606
Nothing can stop progress.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:22.655
Can it?

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.105
Heh, heh.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.315
Phew!

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:01.277
Phew!

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.246
Ah, ah!

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.202
We're almost there.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:23.172
I can feel it thinning out.

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:34.266
Phadrig!

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.847
Phadrig?

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.431
Phadrig!

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.266
Brother!

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:39.931
Are you alright?

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.600
I can handle myself this time.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.992
What
is this trickery?

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.996
It was bait.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.158
Oh, elaborate bait!

01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.209
Oh no!

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.083
No, Tin Man wouldn't
go back on his word.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.247
What word?

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:06.791
The key lies
together with love.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.584
Tin Man has hurt many people,

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:11.128
but he's never betrayed
them in his heart.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.547
We have to go back.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:13.680
We can't stay here.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:14.636
Relax!

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.676
Catch your breath first.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.469
Oh Alondra.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.979
Why didn't you care for Alondra?

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.481
For my sons?

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.518
None of
that was Oscar's fault.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:29.530
It's hard to lose
people, isn't it Mr Digg.

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.691
I'm starting to understand.

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:34.360
It started out with just
you and me in the dungeons.

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:36.199
But then Gromit joined us.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:37.533
We found your brother.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.620
And now all the people
of Oz are with us.

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.625
Together we can do this.

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:54.405
Oh!

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.451
Huh.

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:59.946
He was one of
Tin Man's advisors.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:01.955
To think that he would...

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.708
I'm so sorry,
Scarecrow, we never knew.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:05.993
We have to get him out.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.537
The key's over there.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.797
To the right.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:13.130
Don't really have the
fingers to point it out.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.464
You're alive?

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:18.131
My body
is over there as well.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.936
The key lies
together with love.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.829
Oh!

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.079
Ha!

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.167
Heh, heh, ha!

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:53.634
Hm.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:55.385
Hmm.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.011
Ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.284
Can't give someone brains, but
you sure can give them legs.

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:03.346
So how are we going
to stop Tin Man?

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:07.558
You've already learnt how.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.064
What?

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:11.902
Umm.

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:37.251
Hmm, well, back we go I guess.

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:42.006
The engine pressure
valve is to your left.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.472
Thank you.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.887
How can a scarecrow
live without his head?

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:49.521
Quite boringly.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.669
The matter of my head loss
is a short, but simple story,

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:53.504
which started after the
rebellion in the Emerald City

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:56.987
40 years, seven months,
and five days ago.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.902
They rebelled.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.944
Everything I've done
for Emerald City.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.032
For all of Oz.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:06.872
And they question me.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.686
Is this the
vision you had for Oz?

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.167
For Nimmie?

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:11.772
Is this what you would like
her to see when she wakes?

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.913
The Emerald City torn by hate?

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:16.252
I have guided you, supported
you, all in the hopes

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:18.337
of keeping you from
forgetting your heart.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.719
What has
my heart brought me?

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.723
The anger and spite of
idiot tra-la-la Munchkins

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.017
who took my love.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:31.430
I will not tolerate
them or their magic

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:34.316
in my Emerald City again.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.504
And what of me?

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.109
Will you listen to reason?

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.817
I am
finished listening

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.902
to your so-called advice.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.193
You
know what he did next.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:56.506
You?

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:57.756
Back again?

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.291
I'm not here to fight.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:00.344
Indeed.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.877
Your fight has already ended.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.261
Huh!

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.218
Hah!

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:06.096
Scarecrow?

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.098
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.260
Sharp as ever I see!

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.312
The lions.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.183
Didn't they?

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.188
There is much to tell.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.068
What is
the meaning of this?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.736
Well, victoria?

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:29.701
- You should.
- Go up!

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:30.749
Go now.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.966
My name is victoria Wright.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.801
I know who you are.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.386
Of course you do!

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.971
Scarecrow, why have you come?

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.023
To end it.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.235
This war was to
right our wrongs.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:03.397
I can't believe how wrong I was.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.190
It is required.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:09.954
To purge for the people,
to preserve our prosperity.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.704
Prosperity?

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:12.865
Today Oz lost.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:15.500
Oz needs order.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:19.835
Each step I have taken has
improved the Emerald City,

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.043
soon all of Oz.

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:25.010
This is just another step.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.966
You know it to be true.

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.427
I did walk alongside
Emerald City.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.216
I thought of it as myself.

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:33.511
I also wanted its success.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.522
But you can't only
accept the success.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:39.809
You're responsible for the
failures of Emerald City.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:43.354
I'm also responsible
for a lot of hurt.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:46.490
And we're also responsible
for making it right.

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.742
Why hold onto the failures?

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:51.278
Ignoring them only
makes things worse.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.037
For you, our friends.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.282
the ones we love.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:57.377
Nimmie?

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:02.373
I learnt a heart is not
judged by how much you love,

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:06.169
but by how much you
are loved by others.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.591
The lions.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:13.759
The Munchkins.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:16.188
All of Oz.

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.267
We mustn't run.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:20.603
We must stand strong together.

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.769
Not attempting to be flawless,
impervious to failure,

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:27.030
but together be able
to mend our mistakes.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:30.442
With love and the imperfections
that comes with it,

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.703
we must progress.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.271
It's over.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.389
The war is over!

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:03.109
It's over!

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.107
The war is over!

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.644
Duh, that radio.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.359
She's all ready to go!

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.321
We have lift off!

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.079
Shouldn't you be down there?

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:41.831
I could ask you
the same thing.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:45.119
Well, there's
still a lot of work to do.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.458
With Tin Man stepping down,

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:51.125
Emerald City will
need a new leader.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.509
We'll find your sons.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.010
We'll help each other heal

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:57.674
and make Emerald City
truly the heart of Oz.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.627
I'm here for you, Nimmie.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.810
I will always be here for you

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.324
A heart is not
judged by how much you love,

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:24.657
but by how much you
are loved by others.
