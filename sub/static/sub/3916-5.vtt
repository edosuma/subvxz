00:00.096 --> 00:01.518
<i>Previously on </i> The Fosters...

00:01.577 --> 00:03.410
I cheated on my boyfriend

00:03.445 --> 00:06.762
<i>and I lost my virginity to
Wyatt, Callie's ex-boyfriend.</i>

00:06.784 --> 00:08.317
- I got a grandma.
- Is she...

00:08.319 --> 00:09.790
She's in a home. She got dementia.

00:09.871 --> 00:11.821
Look, I ran your brother's
name through the system.

00:11.873 --> 00:12.872
He hasn't been arrested.

00:12.908 --> 00:14.824
If he's not in jail,
can you see if he's dead?

00:14.876 --> 00:15.909
'Cause he's all I got.

00:15.911 --> 00:17.794
I went to juvie to talk with A.J.,

00:17.829 --> 00:19.078
we've decided I'm going to foster him.

00:19.130 --> 00:21.247
It's going to take some time
for Mike to get his license.

00:21.299 --> 00:24.000
In the meantime, A.J.'s
going to stay here with us.

00:24.052 --> 00:26.085
I got fired from the drop-in
center because of you.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.927
Chris: Brandon, you'll be working with Kat.

00:27.979 --> 00:29.145
There's no way you're pairing me with him.

00:29.180 --> 00:30.346
You and Kat setting me up.

00:30.348 --> 00:31.898
You get me to that party...

00:31.933 --> 00:34.067
And when I don't show up to work in
the morning, I look like a flake...

00:34.102 --> 00:35.601
- Dude, that's insane!
- Is it?

00:35.653 --> 00:37.937
<i>I might have to deal with her,
but I don't have to deal with you.</i>

00:37.989 --> 00:39.188
Kat: <i>You signed your name to a Bach fugue?</i>

00:39.190 --> 00:41.057
And I knew you would say it was crap.

00:41.092 --> 00:43.192
I've had enough of you two
making a joke of this program.

00:43.228 --> 00:44.193

(Grunts) Ah!

00:58.209 --> 01:00.009
(Whispering) Sorry. Sorry...

01:00.045 --> 01:02.178
- What are you doing in my room?
- Shh!

01:02.213 --> 01:03.930
I need you to come with me.

01:03.965 --> 01:05.882
- Why?
- I need your help with something.

01:06.968 --> 01:08.351
Oh, with what?

01:08.386 --> 01:10.303
I will tell you later. Just get
dressed and then meet me outside. Okay?

01:10.355 --> 01:11.888
Okay.

01:12.891 --> 01:14.107
- Mmm?
- And bring your car keys. Come on.

01:16.094 --> 01:17.126
(Sighs)

01:37.415 --> 01:39.048
(Doorbell rings)

01:47.926 --> 01:48.925
Morning!

01:48.927 --> 01:50.059
Morning.

01:51.096 --> 01:52.561
Oh, am I too early?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.263
Too early for what?

01:54.265 --> 01:56.315
Ah, Oscar! You're here.

01:56.351 --> 01:58.017
Mrs. Foster, hello.

01:58.069 --> 02:00.937
I thought you were starting on Monday.

02:00.939 --> 02:03.272
No, we said today, right?

02:04.909 --> 02:06.325
Yeah, you told me sooner the better.

02:06.361 --> 02:09.162
Wait, you hired a contractor?

02:09.197 --> 02:11.330
I was gonna talk to you
about it this weekend.

02:11.366 --> 02:13.249
Oh, I see, and by "talk to me about it,"

02:13.284 --> 02:15.251
you mean you were gonna pretend
like I had some say in this.

02:15.286 --> 02:16.953
Honey, we had to make a decision.

02:17.005 --> 02:18.871
Except we didn't make a decision, you did.

02:18.923 --> 02:20.173
If this is a bad time...

02:20.208 --> 02:22.291
No, no, no, no, no.
We've waited long enough.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.044
Come on in. Go straight through.
You know where you're going.

02:25.096 --> 02:26.129
Okay.

02:26.131 --> 02:27.213
All right. Thanks, Oscar.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.049
(Sighs)

02:30.101 --> 02:31.968
Okay...

02:31.970 --> 02:34.404
If I have to share a bathroom
with those kids for one more day,

02:34.405 --> 02:35.405
I'm going to kill myself.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.191
Now, I realize to you that
sounds good right about now,

02:38.226 --> 02:41.310
but getting all of those
quotes was taking forever.

02:41.312 --> 02:43.229
You want to handle
something all by yourself?

02:43.281 --> 02:45.031
The raccoons got into the garbage.

02:45.066 --> 02:47.116
Okay... (Sighs)

02:54.242 --> 02:56.242
(Exclaims in disgust)

02:56.294 --> 02:57.960
(Muttering)

03:15.313 --> 03:17.180
Callie, we're almost at the border.

03:17.232 --> 03:18.264
Yeah.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.853
Okay. Well, if we keep going, we're
gonna, you know, be in Mexico.

03:23.905 --> 03:24.987
Mm-hmm.

03:25.023 --> 03:27.356
Okay, see... Mexico is another country

03:27.358 --> 03:30.359
and if we cross that border
our moms will kill us.

03:30.361 --> 03:32.912
Look, there's something I have to do

03:32.947 --> 03:37.366
that I'm not really allowed to
do in the state of California.

03:37.368 --> 03:39.335
At least not without parental consent.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.037
Like something illegal?

03:43.124 --> 03:44.123
Callie...

03:45.376 --> 03:46.926

04:46.404 --> 04:48.904
Hi, love, I know you're mad
and I'm sorry to bother you...

04:48.940 --> 04:50.022
We need to go to therapy.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.025
What?

04:53.077 --> 04:54.277
We've got to start communicating.

04:56.281 --> 04:59.982
Okay, if this is about what just
happened, I take complete blame.

05:00.018 --> 05:01.167
It's me. It's my fault, all right?

05:01.202 --> 05:02.251
It's not just a one-time thing.

05:02.287 --> 05:05.054
We have to learn how to do better.

05:05.089 --> 05:07.873
We're communicating right now! We're...

05:07.925 --> 05:09.008
Sure, we talk.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.876
But most times I don't feel heard.

05:10.928 --> 05:13.095
Well, I wasn't feeling heard when
I told you that I was frustrated

05:13.131 --> 05:15.298
with your endless stream
of contractor quotes.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.882
See, this is what I'm talking about.

05:16.934 --> 05:19.268
I tell you something that's bothering me
and you turn it right back around on me.

05:19.304 --> 05:20.936
- What...
- We're never gonna get anywhere

05:20.972 --> 05:22.305
if we keep pointing the
finger at each other.

05:22.357 --> 05:24.106
That's why we need a
neutral third party to...

05:24.142 --> 05:26.142
What? To tell us that
you're right and I'm wrong?

05:26.144 --> 05:28.978
No! To help us both learn how to listen...

05:28.980 --> 05:31.030
Okay. Jenna and Kelly went to therapy

05:31.065 --> 05:33.032
and where are they? They broke up.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.051
Well, by the time they
started going, it was too late.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.986
(Sighs)

05:36.988 --> 05:39.872
Okay, speaking of too late, does
this happen to belong to you?

05:39.907 --> 05:44.076
Or is this something that you prefer to
say with a neutral third party around?

05:44.128 --> 05:45.161
Busted.

05:45.213 --> 05:47.330
I've been having an affair
with Mr. Nesbit next door,

05:47.382 --> 05:49.298
and now I'm pregnant with
an inflatable snowman.

05:49.334 --> 05:51.295
Well, that's actually
preferable to the other scenarios

05:51.296 --> 05:52.296
running around in my head right now.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.136
(Tools clinking)

05:56.941 --> 05:59.842
Sorry. Can you get that for me?

05:59.894 --> 06:01.177
- Oh, my...
- Not a problem.

06:06.184 --> 06:08.217
Someone in this house is
afraid they're pregnant

06:08.252 --> 06:10.319
and I think we should find out who it is.

06:13.324 --> 06:14.190
(Whirring)

06:14.242 --> 06:16.025
Morning.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.194
How's my love bug?

06:18.246 --> 06:20.029
Sorry about all the noise.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.416
Where's Callie?

06:23.451 --> 06:27.336
Um, she said she was going to the
library to work on her history paper.

06:27.372 --> 06:29.905
And why are you still in bed?

06:29.941 --> 06:30.873
Day off.

06:30.925 --> 06:32.091
Everything okay?

06:32.126 --> 06:33.876
Yeah. Everything's fine.

06:35.096 --> 06:36.212
Good.

06:37.265 --> 06:39.215
And everything's okay with Mat?

06:42.019 --> 06:44.120
Actually, we broke up.

06:44.155 --> 06:45.271
Oh, no.

06:45.306 --> 06:46.956
Mariana, what happened?

06:46.991 --> 06:49.258
Well, the tour got extended, so...

06:50.945 --> 06:52.895
He's basically gonna be
on the road all summer

06:52.897 --> 06:55.197
and I just felt like...

06:55.233 --> 06:57.149
I don't know, like I was holding him back.

06:57.201 --> 06:58.167
From what?

06:58.202 --> 06:59.869
Having fun...

06:59.904 --> 07:01.120
hooking up with other girls, I guess.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.239
Other girls...

07:04.942 --> 07:06.292
So you and Mat have hooked up?

07:06.327 --> 07:08.077
Well, duh!

07:08.079 --> 07:09.245
We were boyfriend and girlfriend.

07:11.916 --> 07:13.048
(Sighs) Okay.

07:15.303 --> 07:17.052
Did you use a condom?

07:17.088 --> 07:18.087
What?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.121
When you hooked up.

07:19.157 --> 07:21.307
(Chuckles) Mama, hooking
up doesn't mean sex.

07:21.342 --> 07:23.926
I thought that's what
the kids called it now.

07:23.978 --> 07:25.978
Well, it can mean sex,

07:26.013 --> 07:27.263
but it also means a lot of other things.

07:27.265 --> 07:29.131
(Sighs) So...

07:29.150 --> 07:30.933
You and Mat didn't have sex?

07:30.968 --> 07:31.901
No.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.036
Why are you asking?

07:35.189 --> 07:37.156
No reason. I just think it's...

07:37.191 --> 07:39.191
It's good to check in every now and then.

07:40.945 --> 07:42.077
Okay.

07:43.948 --> 07:45.948
So, um...

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Did Callie mention when she
might be back from the library?

07:48.035 --> 07:49.869
No.

07:49.921 --> 07:51.003
All right.

08:08.306 --> 08:10.973
Last time I was here, she
didn't even know who I was.

08:12.310 --> 08:14.977
Still, I bet she enjoys
seeing a friendly face, huh?

08:15.029 --> 08:17.313
When all else fails, there's
always chocolate, right?

08:17.315 --> 08:18.864
Amen to that.

08:20.985 --> 08:22.234
- How are you?
- Hi.

08:22.286 --> 08:24.954
It's just, sometimes Grandma gets upset...

08:27.208 --> 08:28.991
You want me to go in there with you?

08:30.328 --> 08:32.244
Only if you want to.

08:32.296 --> 08:33.328
Yeah.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.303
Hey, Grandma.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.307
Well, look who's here!

08:48.262 --> 08:52.181
I know I'm long overdue, but it's
great to see you. You look good.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.316
Oh, I've seen better days,

08:54.352 --> 08:57.186
and don't you try telling me otherwise.

08:57.238 --> 08:59.855
Here. Let me help you sit down.

08:59.857 --> 09:01.824
How long has it been?

09:03.861 --> 09:05.895
- Two months.
- No!

09:05.930 --> 09:07.196
I'm afraid so.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.032
Now remind me...

09:10.034 --> 09:11.283
Where have we met?

09:13.871 --> 09:15.204
Uh, Miss Hensdale?

09:15.206 --> 09:16.872
Iris, please.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.109
Pleasure to meet you, Iris.
My name is Mike Foster.

09:21.913 --> 09:23.128
Oh, dear.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.981
- Am I under arrest?
- No, no, no. God, no.

09:26.017 --> 09:27.933
No, I'm looking after your grandson now.

09:29.053 --> 09:31.053
My grandson?

09:31.105 --> 09:33.188
Here, Grandma, I brought you your favorite.

09:33.224 --> 09:37.275
Oh, I like these better than flowers.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.227
That's what I figured.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.281
So nice to see you.

09:44.986 --> 09:46.318
How long has it been?

09:57.248 --> 09:58.914
Callie: I think this is the place.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.251
You're kidding me. Callie, what is this?

10:02.303 --> 10:03.302
You'll see.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.234
Wow, there's like no one here.

10:19.270 --> 10:23.005
Yeah. No one to hear us scream.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.240
We have beaches in San Diego.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.109
What's here that we can't do at home?

10:29.413 --> 10:30.362
That.

10:41.325 --> 10:43.357
Come on, Brandon, it'll be fun.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.712
Callie, I thought this was serious.

10:44.714 --> 10:46.347
Okay? I thought you were in trouble.

10:46.383 --> 10:47.465
Well, so be happy that I'm not.

10:47.517 --> 10:48.683
Okay, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

10:48.718 --> 10:51.352
I just figured if you
knew what we were gonna do,

10:51.388 --> 10:52.604
then you'd probably try
to talk me out of it.

10:52.639 --> 10:53.805
Oh, I'm definitely talking you out of it.

10:53.857 --> 10:55.807
- We're not hang gliding.
- Oh, come on.

10:55.859 --> 10:57.776
If you could have one
superpower, what would it be?

10:57.811 --> 10:59.611
(Sighs) Callie...

10:59.646 --> 11:01.646
Seriously, answer the question.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.615
I don't know. Like, read minds

11:03.650 --> 11:06.317
or be invisible or something.

11:06.369 --> 11:08.536
Okay. Well, I wanna fly.

11:08.572 --> 11:10.488
Come on, I just got my driver's license.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.373
I'm finally off probation...

11:12.409 --> 11:14.409
I can go anywhere I want to go...

11:14.461 --> 11:16.711
For the first time in my life, I'm free.

11:17.747 --> 11:21.583
I just wanna do something completely nuts.

11:21.635 --> 11:23.418
Well, this qualifies.

11:23.420 --> 11:24.752
Oh, come on. I need this.

11:24.754 --> 11:26.387
All right? And you do, too.

11:29.810 --> 11:31.559
Brandon, I'm... (Sighs)

11:31.595 --> 11:35.396
Almost 17 and I don't
have any good stories.

11:38.602 --> 11:41.352
That's why I brought you here.
I just wanted to do something

11:41.404 --> 11:43.488
completely crazy with my best friend.

11:46.443 --> 11:47.575
Whoo!

11:50.363 --> 11:53.448
Well, it... would make a good story.

11:59.456 --> 12:00.538
(Laughing excitedly)

12:01.675 --> 12:04.459
Aren't these delicious?

12:04.461 --> 12:06.294
Have you met my grandson?

12:06.346 --> 12:08.630
Uh, yes, I have. He's a good kid.

12:08.665 --> 12:10.548
Isn't he?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.684
He comes to see me every week.

12:12.719 --> 12:15.470
It's not every week, Grandma...

12:16.606 --> 12:18.690
But I'll be back soon.

12:18.725 --> 12:20.358
I hope so.

12:21.811 --> 12:24.546
Thanks for the flowers.

12:24.581 --> 12:26.781
It was the chocolates that I brought...

12:26.816 --> 12:27.782
but you're welcome.

12:48.505 --> 12:49.554
It was nice to meet you.

12:53.810 --> 12:55.426
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:56.596 --> 12:59.347
It must be hard seeing your
grandma like that, I mean...

12:59.399 --> 13:01.316
You guys were pretty close, right?

13:01.351 --> 13:02.433
Not as close as my brother.

13:02.485 --> 13:04.519
She had more good years
with him, but yeah, I guess.

13:07.524 --> 13:08.690
He ever visit her?

13:08.742 --> 13:10.275
Used to, yeah.

13:26.790 --> 13:28.376
_

13:28.712 --> 13:30.511
That look like it say "Ty Hensdale" to you?

13:30.547 --> 13:32.297
Yeah.

13:32.349 --> 13:33.715
According to this, he
was here two days ago.

13:35.518 --> 13:36.784
Went straight to voice mail.

13:36.820 --> 13:38.686
Why didn't you leave a message?

13:38.738 --> 13:39.988
What am I gonna say...

13:40.023 --> 13:42.323
"Hey Callie, it's mama, just checking to
see if you're pregnant. Give us a call."

13:42.359 --> 13:45.426
No, just that you're checking
in and to get in touch.

13:45.462 --> 13:48.363
Are you really gonna
micromanage a phone call now?

13:48.398 --> 13:49.731
If you think you can do better, go ahead.

13:49.733 --> 13:51.733
All I'm saying is,

13:51.785 --> 13:53.735
I think it's strange that
Callie didn't answer her phone.

13:53.770 --> 13:55.620
Why? She's in a library.

13:56.706 --> 13:57.655
Maybe not.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.291
So she turned off her phone.

14:00.327 --> 14:02.443
They don't turn off their phones, Lena.

14:02.479 --> 14:04.545
They might miss a text or twit... tweet.

14:04.581 --> 14:06.414
I think they Snapchat these days.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.583
But then again, I thought
that hooking up meant sex.

14:08.585 --> 14:10.635
- It doesn't?
- Apparently not.

14:10.670 --> 14:11.753
Wow.

14:11.805 --> 14:13.438
Anyway, my point is,

14:13.473 --> 14:16.507
is that they only turn off their phones
if they don't want us to find them.

14:16.543 --> 14:18.342
Why wouldn't Callie want
us to know where she is?

14:18.378 --> 14:19.544
And that's the question, isn't it?

14:21.364 --> 14:23.531
Instructor: That's it. Light touch.

14:23.566 --> 14:26.734
Now ease out on the control
bar and feel the lift.

14:28.455 --> 14:29.737
Move to the right.

14:29.789 --> 14:30.822
Ah, that's it.

14:30.824 --> 14:32.657
Now you're in the lift.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.410
Is that really all there is to this?

14:35.462 --> 14:36.494
Sure.

14:36.496 --> 14:39.414
That plus a 1,000-foot drop.

14:39.466 --> 14:40.665
You guys are naturals.

14:40.667 --> 14:41.749
Close to <i> listos.</i>

14:43.636 --> 14:44.585
He thinks we're ready.

14:44.637 --> 14:46.637
So, now we're signing the release forms.

14:47.841 --> 14:49.507
Okay.

14:51.394 --> 14:52.727
(Speaking Spanish)

14:58.601 --> 14:59.600
What's it say?

15:00.737 --> 15:02.520
Uh...

15:02.522 --> 15:04.689
Basically, if we die,
it's our own damn fault.

15:04.741 --> 15:06.441
Great!

15:06.493 --> 15:07.692
Except if I die, it's your damn fault.

15:09.446 --> 15:11.496
Not that I have much to
live for these days...

15:11.531 --> 15:13.498
- Brandon...
- (Chuckles) I'm kidding.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.333
Though the idea of plummeting to my death

15:15.368 --> 15:17.368
off a 1,000-foot cliff is only

15:17.370 --> 15:18.703
slightly less appealing

15:18.705 --> 15:20.588
than telling moms that I
got kicked out of Idyllwild.

15:20.623 --> 15:22.507
What happened anyway?

15:22.542 --> 15:26.677
Uh, for starters, I got paired up
with this total diva of a pianist.

15:26.713 --> 15:29.514
- Really? That bad?
- Worse than you can imagine.

15:29.549 --> 15:31.549
Brilliant, but basically evil.

15:31.601 --> 15:34.769
I mean, she'd just crap
on everything I did.

15:34.804 --> 15:37.388
So, to prove a point,

15:37.390 --> 15:40.391
I put my name on this obscure Bach piece...

15:40.443 --> 15:41.793
Wait a second, you plagiarized?

15:41.828 --> 15:44.645
And of course, she called
it a steaming pile of...

15:44.697 --> 15:45.780
Right. So she's an idiot.

15:45.815 --> 15:47.782
No, she's not the only one.

15:47.817 --> 15:49.650
I mean, we both got kicked out.

15:49.702 --> 15:52.603
Yeah, that sucks.

15:52.639 --> 15:53.704
Big time.

15:53.740 --> 15:56.657
But, you know, at least it's over...

15:56.709 --> 15:58.576
Now I don't have to
deal with anymore crazy,

15:58.578 --> 16:00.378
dramatic women in my life.

16:00.413 --> 16:03.414
I mean, first it was Kat and Talya and...

16:09.389 --> 16:11.422
life's too short, you know.

16:19.766 --> 16:21.432
<i>Listos?</i>

16:23.353 --> 16:24.519
What the hell, right?

16:24.571 --> 16:26.571
Yeah. What the hell.

16:32.829 --> 16:34.612
We found this card in the flowers

16:34.664 --> 16:36.747
and we're wondering if
you remember a young man

16:36.783 --> 16:39.333
who may have bought them from
here a couple of days ago?

16:39.369 --> 16:41.335
Uh, African-American, about 20 years old.

16:41.371 --> 16:42.420
Mmm-mmm.

16:42.455 --> 16:44.622
Irises. That's what he bought.

16:44.674 --> 16:47.458
Oh, yeah. I remember.

16:47.460 --> 16:48.676
Most men don't go in for irises.

16:48.711 --> 16:49.710
It's more of an old lady flower.

16:49.762 --> 16:51.462
They were for an old lady.

16:51.464 --> 16:52.763
Do you remember how he paid?

16:52.799 --> 16:54.515
- You mean like credit card?
- Exactly.

16:54.551 --> 16:56.517
Mmm, I don't think so.

16:56.553 --> 16:58.519
I'm pretty sure it was cash.

16:58.555 --> 17:00.388
Yeah, 'cause I remember he
didn't have enough money,

17:00.440 --> 17:02.390
and he offered to put a
couple of flowers back, but...

17:02.442 --> 17:04.642
I just let him keep the
whole dozen anyway. Nice kid.

17:04.644 --> 17:05.643
Did he seem okay?

17:05.694 --> 17:07.310
Yeah. I guess so.

17:07.313 --> 17:09.646
That's my brother.
We're trying to find him.

17:09.648 --> 17:11.531
(Sighs) I don't suppose he's come back in?

17:11.568 --> 17:14.385
- Sorry.
- Did he say anything that might indicate where he's living?

17:14.420 --> 17:16.319
I wish I had more for you.

17:16.321 --> 17:17.655
But thanks for your time.

17:17.656 --> 17:20.407
- You'll call if he comes back in, right?
- Of course.

17:20.460 --> 17:21.492
Good luck, guys.

17:22.545 --> 17:24.328
She said she was going to the library.

17:24.329 --> 17:25.363
What else do you want me to say?

17:25.397 --> 17:26.631
Okay.

17:26.665 --> 17:28.465
You wanna rethink that
answer and try again?

17:28.501 --> 17:29.634
What? You think I'm lying?

17:29.669 --> 17:30.868
I didn't say that.

17:30.904 --> 17:33.437
It's just when you answered me,
you looked up and to the left.

17:33.473 --> 17:34.422
So?

17:34.474 --> 17:35.673
That's what people do when they lie.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.593
How do you know that?

17:38.645 --> 17:41.479
Because I'm a highly trained
police officer, Mariana,

17:41.514 --> 17:43.514
and if you don't tell me where
Callie is right this second,

17:43.516 --> 17:46.517
you're going to be grounded until
you qualify for social security.

17:49.689 --> 17:51.489
Okay...

17:51.524 --> 17:54.442
They may have gone a little
further than the library.

17:54.494 --> 17:55.776
Like how far?

17:55.828 --> 17:58.696
Like... Mexico.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.333
Mexico. Callie went to Mexico?

18:02.368 --> 18:03.534
Just to a beach.

18:03.586 --> 18:05.569
And that's all I know, honest!

18:05.605 --> 18:07.588
Yeah, no, I believe you.

18:07.624 --> 18:09.573
You said "they", Mariana, who is "they"?

18:11.744 --> 18:13.511
Mexico? Together?

18:13.546 --> 18:15.513
Why? Why would they do that?

18:15.548 --> 18:16.547
What? What are you thinking?

18:16.582 --> 18:18.299
I don't even wanna say...

18:18.351 --> 18:19.550
Say!

18:19.552 --> 18:20.718
(Sighs)

18:20.720 --> 18:23.354
I just... I can't help thinking
about the pregnancy test...

18:23.389 --> 18:24.605
Don't! Don't say that.

18:24.641 --> 18:25.723
Well...

18:25.725 --> 18:27.441
well, you seriously think
she went down there to...

18:29.028 --> 18:32.313
but Callie could get whatever medical
attention she would need right here.

18:32.365 --> 18:35.566
What if she doesn't know that? What if
she's afraid that we're going to find out?

18:35.618 --> 18:36.634
Okay, so...

18:37.820 --> 18:41.405
What if... what if she is
pregnant? Why is Brandon with her?

18:41.457 --> 18:42.573
(Sighs) Oh, my god.

18:42.575 --> 18:44.492
You don't think that
he's the father, do you?

18:44.544 --> 18:45.543
(Creaking)

18:47.714 --> 18:49.497
(Sighs) Mariana, get in here!

18:51.751 --> 18:53.551
Okay, hold up!

18:53.586 --> 18:55.469
Callie's pregnant with Brandon's baby?

18:55.505 --> 18:57.555
We don't know that. We don't...

18:57.590 --> 18:59.307
We don't know what to think.

18:59.342 --> 19:01.392
But why would you think
that in the first place?

19:01.427 --> 19:02.476
Because of this.

19:03.863 --> 19:06.731
And since it doesn't belong to
any of us, we could only assume...

19:06.766 --> 19:08.349
It's mine.

19:10.737 --> 19:13.437
Wait a minute, you told me that
you didn't have sex with Mat.

19:15.742 --> 19:18.576
Because I didn't have sex with Mat.

19:19.612 --> 19:21.445
Who did you have sex with?

19:30.458 --> 19:32.098
It's not all bad news.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.053
How you figure that?

19:34.089 --> 19:35.171
Your brother's alive...

19:35.173 --> 19:37.891
And he's okay, and he's been around.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.894
If the florist or anyone at the nursing
home sees him, they'll let us know.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.314
Meanwhile, we'll print up some
fliers with his picture, okay?

19:45.350 --> 19:48.017
Don't give up. We're getting close.

19:48.069 --> 19:49.569
You oughta be a detective.

19:49.604 --> 19:53.072
(Laughs) Detective work's pretty
dull. The real action's on the street.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.991
Dispatcher: <i>Call to any
officers in the area,</i>

19:55.026 --> 19:57.193
<i>report of an 11-7 at 1-2-5 Winston.</i>

19:57.245 --> 19:59.028
<i>Repeat, 11-7 at 1-2-5 Winston.</i>

19:59.030 --> 20:00.196
What's an 11-7?

20:00.198 --> 20:02.865
Prowler on the scene.
Probably a burglar. Not far.

20:02.918 --> 20:05.034
Car 74 solo, I'm on my
way with a ride-along.

20:05.036 --> 20:06.169
A ride-along? That's me?

20:06.204 --> 20:07.337
Yeah. That's you. Let's go.

20:10.926 --> 20:12.208
(Siren wailing)

20:16.264 --> 20:18.181
Okay, so the first question is,

20:18.216 --> 20:19.215
are you pregnant?

20:19.217 --> 20:21.217
No, we used a condom

20:21.269 --> 20:23.219
and I started my period this morning.

20:23.221 --> 20:24.220
(Sighs) Thank god!

20:24.222 --> 20:26.022
So why take a pregnancy test?

20:26.057 --> 20:27.890
I don't know, I was freaking out.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.143
And I felt all weird and moody...

20:30.195 --> 20:32.962
You're a teenager, Mariana,
you're always weird and moody.

20:32.998 --> 20:35.031
And I also had a stomachache that one day.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.984
I don't know. I was just afraid.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.270
And mama had all those extra tests from
when she was trying to get pregnant,

20:41.306 --> 20:43.323
and I figured, why not?

20:43.375 --> 20:45.325
It was supposed to make me feel better.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.243
Well, we're not here to make you feel bad.

20:48.380 --> 20:52.048
I guess the next question is why?

20:52.083 --> 20:54.133
Why have sex?

20:54.169 --> 20:55.952
Well, yeah. That, too.

20:55.987 --> 20:58.021
But why have sex with Wyatt?

20:59.090 --> 21:02.091
Well, the plan was to have sex with Mat,

21:02.093 --> 21:04.177
but then he didn't want to...

21:04.229 --> 21:07.096
So he was just backup sex?

21:07.148 --> 21:08.898
No! No, no, no, no!

21:09.934 --> 21:12.101
- Look, that came out wrong.
- Okay?

21:12.153 --> 21:14.103
I wanted to lose my virginity.

21:14.105 --> 21:16.939
I'm almost 16 and everyone
in this house is having sex...

21:18.026 --> 21:20.276
Maybe not Jude or Callie or you guys.

21:21.946 --> 21:23.997
But you gave Brandon and Jesus condoms...

21:24.032 --> 21:25.481
I don't see what the big deal is.

21:25.483 --> 21:29.185
Losing your virginity at
15 is a big deal, Mariana.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.486
I thought you guys were feminists.

21:30.538 --> 21:32.455
Don't play that card.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.490
We said the exact same
thing to your brothers.

21:34.542 --> 21:38.211
I don't understand why you think
that this is some kind of race.

21:38.246 --> 21:39.495
Well, I did, okay?

21:39.497 --> 21:41.297
And I'm not a virgin anymore, so...

21:42.634 --> 21:45.468
Honey, I think what your
mother is trying to say

21:45.503 --> 21:46.586
is just that we love you,

21:46.638 --> 21:48.504
and we wanna understand your choices.

21:48.506 --> 21:50.389
Well, no one's pregnant.

21:50.425 --> 21:51.557
Can't you just be happy about that?

21:58.516 --> 21:59.448
What?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.067
That was harsh.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.318
No, it wasn't. I...

22:04.405 --> 22:06.072
Where is all of this coming from?

22:06.107 --> 22:07.440
I just want us to be on the same page.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.425
Obviously, Mariana feels
terrible about this,

22:09.460 --> 22:11.494
what is the point in piling on the shame?

22:11.529 --> 22:13.362
Oscar: Excuse me.

22:15.199 --> 22:18.367
Can we just table this
for a minute, please?

22:18.369 --> 22:22.171
We have two children in
Mexico, doing god knows what.

22:22.206 --> 22:23.572
Callie and Brandon are good kids.

22:23.608 --> 22:26.092
They're probably just
enjoying a day on the beach.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.126
Are you sure about that?

22:28.379 --> 22:29.345
Scared?

22:32.467 --> 22:34.350
- Nah, you?
- Nah!

22:35.603 --> 22:37.119
Maybe a little bit.

22:37.155 --> 22:38.271
(Whooping) Yeah!

22:39.607 --> 22:41.274
Yeah, I'm terrified.

22:41.309 --> 22:43.476
Maybe this is a bad idea, you know.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.111
We've had how much instruction?

22:45.146 --> 22:47.396
Uh... couple of hours.

22:47.398 --> 22:49.532
And we know how much about this guy?

22:49.567 --> 22:51.317
- Next to nothing.
- Exactly.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.402
How do we know he's legit,

22:53.404 --> 22:55.571
- or if these gliders even work?
- I mean,

22:55.573 --> 22:57.573
that could be why they're
on a deserted beach

22:57.575 --> 23:01.410
and not a big resort
with lawyers and cameras.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.132
Wind is up. It's time.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.416
Maybe we don't need to jump.

23:07.468 --> 23:09.468
Maybe this is all we
needed to do, you know?

23:09.504 --> 23:12.305
Just stand on the brink
and then step back from it.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.472
- You know?
- Together...

23:13.508 --> 23:15.091
- Together.
- Yeah.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.342
- I'm okay with that.
- Okay.

23:17.512 --> 23:18.511
(Sirens wailing)

23:18.563 --> 23:20.396
(Speaking Spanish)

23:23.318 --> 23:26.102
What? What's he telling us?

23:26.104 --> 23:26.602
To jump!

23:26.604 --> 23:28.404
I don't think I can!

23:28.439 --> 23:30.106
Then I think we're getting arrested.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.107
Okay!

23:32.276 --> 23:34.110
(Screaming)

23:34.112 --> 23:36.362
(Upbeat song playing)

24:02.306 --> 24:04.473
- Brandon!
- Ah!

24:06.310 --> 24:07.393
We're flying!

24:09.230 --> 24:10.363
Whoo!

24:11.399 --> 24:12.448
How do we land?

24:12.483 --> 24:14.200
You can do this, all
right? We're gonna land.

24:16.537 --> 24:18.454
And remember everything he told you, okay?

24:20.158 --> 24:21.290
Ready?

24:34.305 --> 24:37.506
Callie! Hey! You okay?

24:41.562 --> 24:44.313
That was amazing!

24:47.351 --> 24:48.517
- You feel like a superhero?
- Yeah.

24:48.569 --> 24:49.568
Thank you.

24:50.605 --> 24:53.155
That's gonna make a really good story.

24:54.525 --> 24:56.409
- All right. Let's get out of here.
- Yeah!

24:58.529 --> 25:00.112
(Siren wailing)

25:14.091 --> 25:15.780
Mike: All right, look.
I need you to sit tight.

25:16.055 --> 25:17.110
I'll be right back.

25:19.821 --> 25:22.622
Car 74, arrived at the scene.

25:22.657 --> 25:24.741
Olynek's here, we'll go in tandem.

25:24.793 --> 25:26.326
What's going on in there?

25:27.429 --> 25:28.545
We don't know.

25:28.580 --> 25:29.662
So stay in the vehicle, got it?

25:39.841 --> 25:41.558
So we think he's in there?

25:41.593 --> 25:42.592
Mm-hmm.

25:42.644 --> 25:44.477
Mike: All right. We'll take the front.

25:44.513 --> 25:45.478
Officer: All right.

25:53.822 --> 25:54.771
(Glass cracking)

25:54.823 --> 25:55.822
(Clamoring)

25:55.857 --> 25:58.391
- Hands in the air!
- Put your hands up!

25:58.427 --> 25:59.576
(Clamoring continues)

26:12.591 --> 26:13.706
Get down!

26:13.759 --> 26:16.459
Hands back! Hands back now!

26:16.511 --> 26:18.428
I'm with Mike! I'm with Mike!

26:18.463 --> 26:20.547
Face down, do not move!

26:21.616 --> 26:24.517
Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on?

26:24.553 --> 26:26.686
- Put that away!
- Got your guy's accomplice here.

26:26.721 --> 26:28.388
He's with me! He's my ride-along!

26:29.808 --> 26:31.391
My foster son.

26:31.443 --> 26:33.393
- I just saw him and I thought...
- Yeah!

26:33.445 --> 26:34.444
I know what you thought.

26:35.814 --> 26:37.397
Get up. You okay?

26:40.735 --> 26:41.818
Look, I'm sorry, Foster.

26:41.870 --> 26:44.370
I'm not the one you
should be apologizing to.

26:47.542 --> 26:48.575
Sorry.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.629
You okay?

26:53.882 --> 26:55.415
Yeah.

26:57.836 --> 26:59.502
I told you to stay in the car.

27:03.475 --> 27:08.561
No <i> sabia... </i> what we
were doing was <i> ilegal.</i>

27:08.597 --> 27:10.597
We are <i> inocente! Inocente!</i>

27:12.350 --> 27:14.434
Okay, what are we supposed to do?

27:14.436 --> 27:16.402
(Speaking Spanish)

27:16.438 --> 27:18.488
"A show of respect?" What does that mean?

27:18.523 --> 27:20.440
- He says he wants respect.
- Yeah...

27:20.442 --> 27:24.376
- I think it's this kind of respect?
- Oh, you're kidding.

27:25.413 --> 27:26.513
(Speaking Spanish)

27:26.548 --> 27:27.780
That's all I got.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.532
I spent the rest... how much do you have?

27:29.584 --> 27:32.368
I don't have anything. You
told me to bring car keys.

27:32.420 --> 27:33.536
- Wait. Wait.
- Hey!

27:33.588 --> 27:37.423
No, no, no, it's okay. I
wanted to show you something.

27:37.459 --> 27:38.625
Here!

27:48.854 --> 27:51.638
(Speaking Spanish)

27:51.640 --> 27:52.805
Top of the <i> linea.</i>

27:54.442 --> 27:56.559
<i>Usted</i> no play the <i>musica?</i>

27:59.481 --> 28:01.731
<i>Ustedes vendes,</i> get <i>mucho dinero.</i>

28:01.783 --> 28:03.783
Brandon, you can't do this.

28:03.818 --> 28:05.368
Do you have a better idea?

28:07.372 --> 28:08.388
(Knock on door)

28:11.743 --> 28:13.493
Um...

28:13.545 --> 28:15.628
I think... I think I owe you an apology.

28:17.749 --> 28:19.382
I...

28:19.417 --> 28:22.468
I wasn't trying to shame
you, Mariana, I wasn't.

28:23.755 --> 28:25.672
But sex is a big deal.

28:25.674 --> 28:27.507
Every time you have sex it's a big deal.

28:28.777 --> 28:31.811
You're sharing a vulnerable
and precious part of yourself.

28:33.481 --> 28:35.515
You should always make
sure you feel good about it.

28:35.567 --> 28:38.351
Not that we're encouraging
you to have sex at your age.

28:38.353 --> 28:40.353
No, of course not.

28:40.355 --> 28:42.689
You're young, and so are your brothers.

28:42.724 --> 28:44.757
We give them condoms not to encourage them,

28:44.793 --> 28:47.727
but to protect them because we
know we can't control everything.

28:48.863 --> 28:50.446
Try as we might.

28:53.501 --> 28:55.702
Listen...

28:55.754 --> 28:59.422
We just want you to love
yourself as much as we love you.

29:00.775 --> 29:03.676
And it doesn't seem like you
love yourself too much right now.

29:05.430 --> 29:06.646
That's why I broke up with Mat.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.682
I can't tell him what I did.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.386
What do I say to Callie?

29:14.489 --> 29:15.488
She's gonna hate me.

29:15.523 --> 29:17.390
(Sighs)

29:17.442 --> 29:19.309
Oh, my love. You know what?

29:19.361 --> 29:21.561
We all do things that we wish we hadn't.

29:21.596 --> 29:24.564
But we learn from them, and if we...

29:25.817 --> 29:29.435
manage not to repeat them...

29:29.471 --> 29:31.704
Man, it feels really, really good.

29:46.638 --> 29:47.587
(Cars honking)

29:47.639 --> 29:49.339
(Speaking Spanish)

29:58.817 --> 30:01.651
No, thank you. No! Thank you! Thanks!

30:03.605 --> 30:04.821
What are we gonna tell moms?

30:04.856 --> 30:07.407
I mean, by the time we get
home, it's gonna be so late.

30:10.495 --> 30:12.495
I'll buy you another keyboard.

30:14.699 --> 30:17.583
It's not like I need it anyway.

30:17.619 --> 30:20.586
You ever get the feeling like the whole
world is just conspiring against you?

30:22.424 --> 30:24.424
Yeah. I'm pretty familiar
with that concept.

30:28.596 --> 30:29.762
Wait! What does that sign say?

30:33.852 --> 30:35.468
We need passports?

30:38.523 --> 30:39.639
(Sighs)

30:42.145 --> 30:45.146
God, I thought we just
needed our driver's licenses.

30:45.198 --> 30:46.514
Well, I guess you were wrong.

30:46.549 --> 30:48.232
No, but when we came in to Mexico,

30:48.284 --> 30:49.317
they just waved us through.

30:49.369 --> 30:52.203
Maybe you should've done
some research before you...

30:52.238 --> 30:55.122
- No! Thank you! No! Thank you!
- No, thank you, sir!

30:55.158 --> 30:58.209
Before you kidnapped me and
dragged me into another country

30:58.244 --> 31:00.328
for some stupid, illegal adventure.

31:00.380 --> 31:03.164
Sure, sure. Nothing's ever your fault.

31:03.166 --> 31:04.465
Oh, so, how is this on me?

31:04.500 --> 31:06.384
Don't worry, it's not.

31:06.419 --> 31:09.170
No, 'cause the whole universe
is conspiring against you,

31:09.172 --> 31:13.090
and you can just blame one of us
"dramatic girls" for ruining your life.

31:14.510 --> 31:17.178
Truth is, things were a lot
easier before you showed up.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.182
(Scoffing)

31:21.184 --> 31:22.183
Screw you, Brandon.

31:23.486 --> 31:24.435
Callie!

31:28.391 --> 31:30.241
Callie! Callie!

31:32.495 --> 31:35.363
What're you gonna do,
walk home from Mexico?

31:35.365 --> 31:38.165
Or maybe you can just call your new
boyfriend to come pick you up, huh?

31:38.201 --> 31:39.250
What are you talking about?

31:39.285 --> 31:40.451
Just saying,

31:40.503 --> 31:43.087
there is a new foster brother now.

31:43.122 --> 31:44.372
There is nothing going
on between me and A.J.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.424
(Scoffing) I'm not blind, Callie.

31:46.459 --> 31:48.426
Actually, I think you are, Brandon.

31:48.461 --> 31:51.128
Walking around thinking you're some victim?

31:51.180 --> 31:53.214
Acting like the world is out to get you?

31:53.266 --> 31:55.433
You don't see the drama that you create.

31:55.468 --> 31:58.052
You were the one who
turned up to girls united

31:58.104 --> 31:59.520
and got yourself a restraining order.

31:59.555 --> 32:02.273
You were the one who started selling
fake ids that got your hand crushed.

32:02.308 --> 32:05.393
You were the one who plagiarized Bach
and then got kicked out of Idyllwild.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.312
Okay? If you're really worried about
the drama in your life, Brandon,

32:08.364 --> 32:10.398
look at the common
denominator, okay? It's you!

32:14.370 --> 32:15.486
Can we just go back to the car?

32:18.408 --> 32:20.307
Where is the car?

32:26.249 --> 32:28.048
You want some dinner?

32:29.302 --> 32:31.318
(Sighs) I'm pretty beat.

32:31.354 --> 32:33.387
Maybe we should order
in? What do you feel like?

32:33.423 --> 32:35.389
Chinese?

32:35.425 --> 32:37.057
Pizza?

32:39.095 --> 32:40.261
Look, I know today was tough...

32:40.296 --> 32:41.262
You don't know.

32:42.365 --> 32:44.432
(Sighs) Okay.

32:44.467 --> 32:46.434
Fair enough.

32:46.436 --> 32:47.485
You wanna talk about it?

32:47.520 --> 32:48.486
Why?

32:50.139 --> 32:52.106
What you gotta say?

32:52.158 --> 32:54.325
You gonna tell me how to talk to cops, huh?

32:54.360 --> 32:57.111
My grandma already schooled
me on that, all right?

32:57.113 --> 32:59.163
"Hands on the steering
wheel, never resist... "

32:59.198 --> 33:00.448
"Yes, sir, no, sir."

33:00.500 --> 33:02.450
"Let 'em look through whatever
you got, and lie down like a dog

33:02.502 --> 33:04.118
'cause you ain't no better than one."

33:04.120 --> 33:06.287
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

33:06.339 --> 33:07.455
It's the truth!

33:07.457 --> 33:09.373
It's how a black man
gets treated by the cops.

33:09.425 --> 33:11.008
You should know.

33:11.043 --> 33:13.027
I may be a cop, but I'm
also your foster father.

33:13.062 --> 33:14.178
No, you ain't.

33:14.213 --> 33:15.429
Okay, well, I'm gonna be.

33:15.465 --> 33:17.131
Why?

33:17.133 --> 33:18.365
We both know this ain't gonna work.

33:18.401 --> 33:20.301
Of course it is.

33:20.303 --> 33:21.385
Why are you even doing this?

33:21.437 --> 33:23.053
I'm trying to help you, A.J.!

33:23.105 --> 33:24.221
You don't know how to help me, Mike!

33:24.273 --> 33:26.273
You got no idea what it's
like to be living down

33:26.309 --> 33:28.275
to the low expectations
society has for you.

33:28.311 --> 33:30.478
"Foster kid?"

33:30.530 --> 33:32.146
"Black kid?"

33:32.181 --> 33:35.483
"Oh! You must be headed
for gangs, drugs, jail."

33:35.485 --> 33:38.219
I've been hearing it so long, I'm
starting to wonder if they're right.

33:38.254 --> 33:39.370
They're not right, A.J.!

33:39.405 --> 33:41.372
And you should stop listening
to those people right now!

33:41.407 --> 33:43.374
Except there's a lot more
of them and only one of me.

33:43.409 --> 33:45.493
Not anymore. Now there's two.

33:45.495 --> 33:47.161
Right?

33:47.213 --> 33:49.079
There's two of us. Come here!

33:51.501 --> 33:53.300
And this cop...

33:53.336 --> 33:55.302
sees a bright...

33:55.338 --> 33:57.221
talented, decent young man.

33:57.256 --> 34:00.090
This cop's not gonna let you live
down to anybody's expectations.

34:00.142 --> 34:01.141
You understand me?

34:02.311 --> 34:03.477
Come here!

34:05.348 --> 34:08.449
All you need is someone
who believes in you.

34:08.484 --> 34:11.085
Someone you can count on
and I'm gonna be that person.

34:12.288 --> 34:13.353
You know why?

34:15.107 --> 34:17.074
'Cause I have to believe in a world where

34:17.109 --> 34:19.193
a kid like you gets a real chance.

34:19.245 --> 34:21.277
That's why I'm doing this, A.J., okay?

34:48.378 --> 34:50.378
You didn't mess up my life, Callie. I did.

34:51.731 --> 34:53.764
It's just...

34:53.800 --> 34:56.333
Easier to blame you for it.

34:56.335 --> 34:57.669
And if I'm being honest,

34:57.704 --> 35:00.438
I was kinda relieved that

35:00.473 --> 35:01.673
Idyllwild kicked me out.

35:01.675 --> 35:03.675
If I could blame Kat,

35:03.727 --> 35:05.510
then it wasn't my fault.

35:06.546 --> 35:07.612
You know?

35:10.383 --> 35:11.749
You think they'll give you another chance?

35:14.521 --> 35:16.354
Doubt it.

35:16.356 --> 35:18.523
And honestly, I don't wanna
know the answer, either way.

35:23.446 --> 35:25.330
When we were at the edge of that cliff...

35:27.701 --> 35:30.335
that's how it felt every day at camp.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.407
I was so close to something so huge...

35:38.378 --> 35:40.712
only I was too scared
to do something about it.

35:46.386 --> 35:47.685
Except today you jumped, Brandon.

35:50.590 --> 35:51.723
You jumped.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.445
(Sighs) What're we gonna say?

35:59.399 --> 36:00.398
Passport?

36:01.651 --> 36:03.318
Hello, Officer.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.738
Um... so it looks like we
did something really stupid.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.662
Thank you.

36:23.673 --> 36:24.589
<i>Hola.</i>

36:25.642 --> 36:27.392
Mariana: They made me tell!

36:27.427 --> 36:29.344
Okay, we didn't mean to...

36:29.396 --> 36:30.678
You know what? Don't start, Brandon.

36:30.730 --> 36:31.763
It's my fault.

36:31.765 --> 36:35.316
I kidnapped Brandon and took him to Mexico.

36:35.352 --> 36:36.768
I just needed to get out of my head

36:36.770 --> 36:39.604
and we ended up getting out of the country.

36:39.606 --> 36:41.439
Why... why Mexico? What did you do?

36:41.441 --> 36:43.524
We just chilled on the beach.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.609
Nothing wild.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.577
- We even used sunscreen.
- Oh!

36:46.613 --> 36:48.579
Oh, that's good.

36:48.615 --> 36:50.531
- Any drinking?
- None. Promise.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.784
Then how'd you get back into
the country with no passports?

36:52.786 --> 36:54.335
Played dumb.

36:54.371 --> 36:56.788
That couldn't have been hard.

36:56.790 --> 37:00.508
There will be consequences that we
talk about later, but right now...

37:00.543 --> 37:02.543
Brandon, you have a visitor in the kitchen.

37:10.387 --> 37:11.436
Hey!

37:11.471 --> 37:12.687
Sucks to be you, huh?

37:16.643 --> 37:17.692
Um...

37:17.727 --> 37:20.361
look, if this is about what I said...

37:20.397 --> 37:22.647
about... you and Kat...

37:22.699 --> 37:25.366
Setting me up, I'm sorry.

37:25.402 --> 37:28.486
- I really thought...
- Dude, I get it.

37:28.488 --> 37:31.706
Kat could drive Gandhi
to smack a baby... hard.

37:31.741 --> 37:34.375
But that's not the reason I
drove all the way down here.

37:34.411 --> 37:36.761
How the hell do you make
that drive every day, anyway?

37:36.796 --> 37:40.465
Well, that's one good thing, I
guess, I don't have to anymore.

37:41.584 --> 37:43.301
Okay. What if I told you, you might?

37:44.604 --> 37:46.754
See, I was talking to my pianist, Jin,

37:46.806 --> 37:49.507
and I said what a raw
deal I thought you got.

37:49.509 --> 37:51.592
And he said... if you want...

37:53.346 --> 37:54.479
he'd be willing to take you on.

37:56.383 --> 37:57.598
So that means I'm back in?

38:03.356 --> 38:04.422
Aw, hell!

38:04.457 --> 38:06.324
Hey, Oscar.

38:06.359 --> 38:08.359
Finished for the day? How'd it go?

38:08.361 --> 38:10.244
- Made some good progress.
- Good.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.280
All right. Well, we'll
see you on Monday, yeah?

38:12.332 --> 38:15.299
Uh... yes. Although there is one thing...

38:16.369 --> 38:17.452
Yeah, what is it?

38:17.504 --> 38:21.672
I have to ask if you
can pay me now, in full.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.374
Whoa, Oscar, wait a minute.

38:23.426 --> 38:24.425
We have a deal...

38:24.461 --> 38:26.294
A payment schedule. Why
do you suddenly want...

38:26.346 --> 38:28.346
Look, when couples break up,

38:28.381 --> 38:29.680
it usually means I don't get paid

38:29.716 --> 38:31.599
until the lawyers are all done.

38:31.634 --> 38:33.301
What... why're...

38:33.353 --> 38:35.553
you think Lena and I are breaking up?

38:36.606 --> 38:37.688
Why would you...

38:37.724 --> 38:39.390
Look, if you prefer,

38:39.392 --> 38:40.691
we could talk about an escrow account.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.282
Well, as much as it pains me to say it,

38:48.318 --> 38:49.700
seems like Oscar got a
lot of work done today.

38:52.705 --> 38:53.738
Yeah.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.375
Speaking of home repair,

38:57.410 --> 39:00.495
I think, um... I think that you...

39:00.547 --> 39:02.580
actually have a point.

39:02.582 --> 39:04.465
I do?

39:04.501 --> 39:07.585
Yeah. I was thinking that...

39:09.589 --> 39:11.389
If you feel that...

39:11.424 --> 39:14.509
that a third party
would help us then, um...

39:14.561 --> 39:18.262
I guess, I'm up for
some couples counseling.

39:20.266 --> 39:21.682
Wow. That's a surprise.

39:23.603 --> 39:25.269
(Chuckles) You're telling me.

39:26.439 --> 39:27.738
What changed your mind?

39:27.774 --> 39:30.408
(Sighs) Honestly, um...

39:31.744 --> 39:35.446
our new contractor seems to
think our marriage is in trouble.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.502
Yeah.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.291
You went hang-gliding?

39:47.293 --> 39:48.292
Shh!

39:49.629 --> 39:50.711
Are you crazy?

39:50.763 --> 39:52.346
Little bit.

39:55.468 --> 39:56.534
Were you scared?

39:57.720 --> 40:00.354
- Brandon went, too?
- Mm-hmm.

40:00.390 --> 40:01.472
He was scared though, right?

40:01.524 --> 40:03.307
Way more scared than me.

40:06.479 --> 40:09.564
Well, the next time you're
looking for adventure,

40:09.616 --> 40:11.649
you oughta knock on my door.

40:11.651 --> 40:13.317
A.J...

40:14.721 --> 40:16.420
(Whispering) Callie...

40:16.456 --> 40:18.623
A.J., you're my foster brother. I can't...

40:20.460 --> 40:22.493
Okay. What about when I'm not?

40:24.380 --> 40:25.329
When you're...

40:25.381 --> 40:26.414
When I move in with Mike.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.719
Um, then I guess we
will cross that bridge...

40:31.754 --> 40:33.504
When we get to it?

40:36.726 --> 40:38.759
All right.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.595
I got all the time in the world.

40:54.627 --> 40:55.693
(Cell phone rings)

41:05.421 --> 41:06.404
Hello?

41:06.439 --> 41:08.339
