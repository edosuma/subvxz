01:22.520 --> 01:24.450
I love these street markets.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.180
I always visit them when I travel.

01:27.270 --> 01:27.870
Right.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.450
And the sausages are great.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.910
I just love it here,
I want to come tomorrow!

01:36.000 --> 01:38.160
- They aren't open then.
- Really?

01:38.160 --> 01:40.120
Just three times a week.

01:40.850 --> 01:45.120
On this trip I've liked
the market and the park the best.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.750
Good, then let's stop
at the park after this.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.780
The park first, and then the house?

01:52.900 --> 01:54.720
I thought we could go a bit late.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.040
Really?

01:56.850 --> 02:01.450
You know this was picked
as the best city to live in?

02:01.450 --> 02:03.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.430
They did a poll last year,

02:05.580 --> 02:09.430
and it was the #1 city
where people wanted to live.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.039
Is that so?

02:11.440 --> 02:14.290
Funny, right?
That's where we are now.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.870
- I'm lucky.
- Yeah.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.000
How did you end up here?

02:19.100 --> 02:21.580
It was because of Paul.

02:22.190 --> 02:25.080
The one we're seeing today? It was him?

02:25.900 --> 02:29.950
I was in touch with him
when I was leaving Seoul.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.040
He said it's beautiful here,
that I should come.

02:34.440 --> 02:38.410
It's not like I know anyone
in any other country.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.620
So I came here.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.330
Should I live here too?

03:01.310 --> 03:01.910
What?

03:03.650 --> 03:04.910
I'd like to.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.580
I've no reason to go back.

03:08.310 --> 03:10.410
Sure, give it a try.

03:11.230 --> 03:14.500
Should I live together with you?
Shall we?

03:15.440 --> 03:17.830
Not sure about that.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.330
Not sure? Why, you don't want to?

03:20.690 --> 03:23.450
No, it's not that.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.450
I'm the kind of person
who needs to live alone.

03:26.810 --> 03:29.910
For 10 years you were
happy with your husband.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.000
Was I?

03:35.480 --> 03:38.250
That was out of necessity.

03:38.270 --> 03:40.080
- Not because you wanted to?
- Right.

03:41.730 --> 03:43.830
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

03:44.560 --> 03:49.760
I thought I needed a husband
and he was nice enough.

03:49.850 --> 03:53.000
But we lived in separate rooms
almost from the start.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.750
Really?

03:57.330 --> 03:59.660
You don't want to live with me?

04:02.870 --> 04:04.500
I don't know if he will.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.580
If he does, he does. If not, fine.

04:11.910 --> 04:15.540
I won't wait, Let him come if he wants.

04:16.250 --> 04:16.910
Sure.

04:18.450 --> 04:20.700
He knows where I am.

04:26.620 --> 04:29.660
I don't think he'll come,
you said he's married?

04:31.580 --> 04:33.790
So, he won't come?

04:33.790 --> 04:35.750
Yeah, he's married.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.200
It didn't stop your husband.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.540
I'm different, I have no desire.

04:43.540 --> 04:47.330
No, that's not true. But it's weak.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.790
I hope he's happy.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.580
I feel a bit sorry, actually.

04:59.750 --> 05:02.830
You're an odd person.

05:04.870 --> 05:05.370
Am I?

05:07.700 --> 05:12.120
Sure, you have more desire.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.370
More than you, I'm sure.

06:14.790 --> 06:15.870
Hello!

06:18.830 --> 06:20.160
What time is it?

06:30.370 --> 06:31.790
Do you know what time it is?

06:33.540 --> 06:34.920
You don't know what time it is?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.120
You don't have a phone or anything?

06:39.450 --> 06:40.040
All right.

07:00.870 --> 07:04.370
I heard vacation was starting.
It's really closed.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.370
It's vacation?

07:08.460 --> 07:09.420
Where should we go?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.040
- I was going to have soup.
- They sell soup here?

07:14.580 --> 07:16.700
Vegetable soup, it's really good.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.120
That would have been nice.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.790
But vacation starts so early?

07:24.080 --> 07:28.000
It's important to people here.
They take it seriously.

07:29.370 --> 07:32.620
Don't you need to eat?
You must be hungry.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.330
No, I'm fine.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.910
Shouldn't you eat before visiting him?

07:37.120 --> 07:39.120
No, I'm fine!

07:43.290 --> 07:44.790
Isn't this nice?

07:45.660 --> 07:47.660
Let's come back for sure.

07:47.660 --> 07:49.290
- Sure.
- It's so pretty.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.000
It's like a fairy tale cottage.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

09:26.540 --> 09:29.290
It's be great to come
walk here every day.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.290
Being here with you is really nice.

09:34.660 --> 09:41.500
People here are blessed
to have this place to enjoy.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.540
Still, it's lonely walking alone.

09:43.540 --> 09:44.450
Right.

09:45.370 --> 09:50.500
Even more lonely,
in a beautiful landscape.

09:51.620 --> 09:52.410
That's right.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.620
Why did you bow before, can I ask?

10:00.830 --> 10:02.830
Before crossing the bridge,

10:03.830 --> 10:08.620
To try resolving
what it is I really want.

10:09.410 --> 10:10.700
Just a prayer.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.410
What is it that you want?

10:17.330 --> 10:21.950
What I want is to live
in a way that suits me.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.700
To be strong,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.790
and whatever happens,
to live my own way.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.120
That's what I decided.

10:32.450 --> 10:33.500
That's good.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.750
I thought you were
missing that guy again.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.540
He's only human...

10:43.950 --> 10:49.370
If it can't work,
there's nothing I can do.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.790
Why did you break up?

11:00.000 --> 11:07.370
You know how direct I am,
so sometimes...

11:10.000 --> 11:15.330
In some ways, it was too hard for me.

11:18.830 --> 11:22.040
Men have a hard time with that.

11:24.580 --> 11:27.910
- You're quite direct.
- So are you.

11:28.450 --> 11:29.200
Thank you.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.620
That's all it is. Honesty is important.

11:36.120 --> 11:36.620
Is it?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.500
He's got a kid.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.620
Kids are like an inescapable destiny.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.290
That's what they say.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.750
But he says he's coming?

11:57.540 --> 12:00.950
He sent an email.
Said he'll come, definitely.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.040
I don't know.
Who knows.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.580
Do you love him?

12:11.500 --> 12:12.580
I like him.

12:14.410 --> 12:15.250
I love him.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.330
Still, if it's too hard, what can I do?

12:21.950 --> 12:24.500
I can't stake everything on him.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.500
When's he coming?

12:31.660 --> 12:33.790
This Saturday, he said.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.620
Saturday is quite soon.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.870
On the 6:30 flight.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.500
The same flight that I took.

12:45.580 --> 12:48.000
Not much time left.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.500
He'll be here soon.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.500
Who knows if he'll really come.

12:54.660 --> 12:55.370
Why?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.540
The situation keeps changing.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.700
He's not an easy person either.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.040
He's sensitive.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.500
Who knows.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.290
Guess it's hard on him too.

13:16.410 --> 13:17.910
What is?

13:22.950 --> 13:25.290
It's shameful to say.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.580
Anyway, I won't wait for him.

13:30.750 --> 13:34.580
If he really comes, then i'll see him.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.700
I'll decide then.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.410
That guy's coming.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.750
It's really him.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.870
- Let's run away.
- Let's go.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.080
Are these books in English?

14:23.370 --> 14:25.830
There are a few.
I bought some.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.660
You did?
Maybe I'll buy a book.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.040
- Won't we be late?
- It's okay.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.870
The owner here is really nice.
He has cancer.

14:36.410 --> 14:39.160
But he never shows it, he's so brave.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.500
Really?

14:41.450 --> 14:42.950
That's so sad.

14:43.580 --> 14:47.410
He's a composer,
and he writes song for kids.

14:47.790 --> 14:50.750
- Really?
- It's quite touching.

14:52.370 --> 14:53.910
- Shall we go in?
- Sure.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.540
- They have places like this here?
- What?

16:57.410 --> 16:58.910
Drink this.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.329
Have to wait a bit longer.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.160
The water's good.

17:09.910 --> 17:11.540
It's refreshing.

17:11.950 --> 17:12.910
I'm glad.

17:15.329 --> 17:16.619
Aren't you hungry?

17:17.329 --> 17:19.329
You must be hungry.

17:20.829 --> 17:24.329
I ate a sausage,
but you only had one bite.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.579
Actually I'm okay now.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.450
We'll eat soon.

17:30.870 --> 17:32.950
You must be starving.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.450
That's a long phone call.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.250
I guess she's busy.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.370
She always looked tired.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.410
Really?

17:52.120 --> 17:54.290
Paul seems nice.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.870
I bet she walks all over him.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.410
- You think so?
- Yeah.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.700
She controls him completely,
don't you think?

18:05.950 --> 18:10.160
He's nice.
So he treats women well.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.540
He's kind.

18:12.910 --> 18:15.830
Right, men here are kind.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.370
They're gentle.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.040
Gentle?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.790
Why is his face so red?

18:36.000 --> 18:36.790
Is it?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.580
He's totally blushing.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.000
It wasn't that way earlier.

18:43.660 --> 18:45.200
It wasn't?

18:47.160 --> 18:50.120
You see things like that well.
I never notice.

18:50.450 --> 18:52.410
I'm good at seeing things.

18:53.950 --> 18:54.580
Right.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.330
I'll get you some more.

21:09.910 --> 21:10.500
I'll come too.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.200
Why don't you say anything?

21:42.410 --> 21:43.950
What would I say?

21:44.160 --> 21:47.500
I'm the only one talking, it's so hard.

21:47.790 --> 21:48.580
It's ready.

21:49.450 --> 21:51.620
I thought you were close to them?

21:52.200 --> 21:57.080
I just can't get myself to talk
in front of English speakers.

21:57.080 --> 21:57.580
Really?

21:59.160 --> 22:00.660
I just say whatever.

22:00.870 --> 22:03.450
Right, that's how you improve.

22:03.830 --> 22:06.950
- Your English is good.
- No it's not!

22:08.500 --> 22:10.870
Now I think I'll study seriously.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.790
You'll need to read a lot
then you'll write well.

22:14.950 --> 22:19.040
And if you listen a lot,
you'll speak well too.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.080
So read the books you bought.

22:22.450 --> 22:23.290
I'll take that.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.660
- Speak!
- No, I can't.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.200
Younghee!

23:11.370 --> 23:12.500
What are you drawing?

23:13.790 --> 23:14.870
A face.

23:15.330 --> 23:17.040
Who is it?

23:19.290 --> 23:19.910
Him.

23:22.540 --> 23:24.250
You drew it well.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.040
- He's that good-looking?
- Yeah.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.830
He doesn't look like this.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.290
But it's a bit similar.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.080
No hair?

23:39.250 --> 23:39.750
Right.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.830
It fell out, he's bald.

23:42.870 --> 23:43.660
Seriously?

23:47.870 --> 23:49.200
I don't know.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.580
How old is he anyway?

23:55.870 --> 23:59.410
He's not at all bald,
it's just starting a bit.

24:00.580 --> 24:01.870
So he's not totally bald?

24:02.830 --> 24:03.950
That's a relief.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.830
I don't care about men's looks anymore.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.500
It's not important.

24:11.120 --> 24:11.660
Really?

24:12.830 --> 24:14.370
That's unexpected.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.000
Good-looking guys are all vain.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.500
You dated a lot of good-looking guys?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.540
Yeah, I did.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.660
I really played around.

24:29.910 --> 24:30.790
Good for you.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.790
I never played around.

24:35.660 --> 24:37.410
When will I get the chance?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.620
Do whatever you want.

24:42.660 --> 24:44.750
Before you die, do everything.

24:45.410 --> 24:47.950
I don't know, I'm old now.

24:48.410 --> 24:50.080
So don't waste your time.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.830
I really envy you.

25:08.410 --> 25:10.330
I really miss him.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.950
Is he thinking of me too?

25:21.040 --> 25:22.410
I don't know.

25:30.580 --> 25:31.540
Just a minute.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.160
Okay.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.370
It's cold, right?

25:41.620 --> 25:43.160
Yeah, it is!

25:43.750 --> 25:45.120
We should go.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.370
Sure, tell them let's go.

27:19.540 --> 27:24.330
Kim Minhee

27:24.500 --> 27:29.500
Kwan Haehyo
Jung Jaeyoung

27:29.700 --> 27:34.500
Moon Sungkeun
Song Seonmi

27:34.660 --> 27:39.450
Ahn Jarhong
Park Yeaju

29:41.500 --> 29:42.450
- Hey...
- Yes?

29:43.830 --> 29:44.950
You ignoring me?

29:46.330 --> 29:47.540
- Me?
- Yeah.

29:47.910 --> 29:49.830
What is it?
Don't you know me?

29:50.950 --> 29:53.750
Of course I know you.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.500
Do I scare you?
Why avoid me?

29:56.750 --> 30:00.540
I'm not avoiding you,
I was looking at the schedule.

30:00.540 --> 30:01.080
Really?

30:02.330 --> 30:03.950
I kept looking at you.

30:04.870 --> 30:05.660
I work here.

30:05.910 --> 30:08.160
Really?
What kind of work?

30:08.910 --> 30:10.120
What do you think?

30:11.660 --> 30:14.500
- Maybe, programming?
- That's right.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.290
So you live here now?

30:18.580 --> 30:20.040
You visited here before!

30:21.250 --> 30:24.450
- Yes, I came a few years ago.
- Right.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.600
Did you go to BongBong?
You saw Myungsoo?

30:26.910 --> 30:31.540
No, I didn't.
I was watching a film.

30:31.910 --> 30:35.500
- I came to see Junhee.
- Oh, Junhee?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.160
I see.

30:37.950 --> 30:39.950
I had some extra time.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.040
Junhee goes back and forth.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.910
I thought so. She's in Gangneung now.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.500
I know. I saw her.
We talked a few days ago.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.330
You look younger.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.250
Really? Thanks.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.660
You were abroad?

30:58.370 --> 30:58.950
Yes.

30:59.870 --> 31:01.080
And you're back for good?

31:02.410 --> 31:04.750
I don't know yet.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.660
You look more mature.

31:10.950 --> 31:14.700
A bit older.
Like a woman, now.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.790
Stop it.
You've gotten younger.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.870
Why'd you come here?

31:23.950 --> 31:27.200
I called Junhee after coming back,

31:27.410 --> 31:31.830
and she suggested
going to the winter sea.

31:32.370 --> 31:35.000
I really wanted to
see the sea in winter.

31:35.250 --> 31:38.080
Yes, it's beautiful here.
It's really nice.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.080
I guess it is.

31:39.950 --> 31:44.330
If they picked the prettiest
cities in Korea, it's probably #1.

31:46.750 --> 31:49.500
What?
You don't think so?

31:50.660 --> 31:52.370
It is, probably.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.500
- What did you do abroad?
- Me?

31:58.250 --> 32:01.950
I just... was there, it was nice.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.080
I heard the rumors.

32:06.540 --> 32:07.870
What rumors?

32:08.910 --> 32:09.830
Rumors about you.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.250
What rumors did you hear?

32:16.330 --> 32:19.040
You had an affair
with a married guy,

32:19.500 --> 32:23.080
disappeared for a while,
went abroad, all that.

32:23.830 --> 32:24.540
Is it true?

32:26.120 --> 32:27.040
Guess it must be.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.370
Don't be offended.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.200
I'm not offended.

32:33.500 --> 32:37.660
But did he stop making films?
Why no news about him?

32:37.660 --> 32:41.250
Well, I don't really know.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.410
You were gone for too long.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
Yes, it was long.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.330
Will you work again?

32:56.500 --> 32:58.120
I don't know.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.660
I'm just back to see my mom and dad.

33:02.870 --> 33:05.830
You're really talented.
You must know that.

33:07.950 --> 33:11.040
You shouldn't quit work because of that.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.290
I didn't quit.

33:14.910 --> 33:15.500
You didn't?

33:16.450 --> 33:17.330
That's good.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.910
Want to have a coffee?
At BongBong?

33:21.660 --> 33:24.040
You can see Myungsoo.
You have time?

33:24.410 --> 33:26.700
Myungsoo works there?

33:27.950 --> 33:30.450
You came before, didn't you?

33:30.950 --> 33:32.870
Yes, a few years ago.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.160
Then why keep talking
like you don't know?

33:36.200 --> 33:40.700
I never knew Myungsoo works there.

33:41.750 --> 33:42.540
You didn't?

33:43.580 --> 33:46.080
We started it with him.

33:46.450 --> 33:47.950
The four of us.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.500
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.540
Anyway, let's go for coffee.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.330
Sure, let's go.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.330
There's something I need to tell you.

33:59.700 --> 34:00.250
Really?

34:00.950 --> 34:03.000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

34:50.290 --> 34:52.790
It's nicer than I thought here.

34:52.909 --> 34:53.540
Really?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.949
Should I live in Gangneung, too?

35:01.160 --> 35:02.200
Think about it.

35:04.580 --> 35:05.750
Maybe I will.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.620
I'm totally fed up with Seoul,
but shouldn't you work there?

35:16.250 --> 35:19.950
I don't know, Seoul's not good for me.

35:22.540 --> 35:23.580
Think about it.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.260
It's not something to be impulsive about.

35:26.910 --> 35:30.450
The situation should be right for you.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.450
When will you meet Junhee?

35:39.660 --> 35:41.120
I sent a message.

35:41.580 --> 35:42.250
Yeah?

35:43.540 --> 35:45.540
I know where she is.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.370
- She's working?
- Yes.

35:51.910 --> 35:55.000
Work is important.
I need to work, too.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
No sign of Myngsoo.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.620
When is Myungsoo coming?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.450
He texted me.
He's coming soon.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.660
I need to go now.

36:08.450 --> 36:10.290
I'll come back later, then.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.250
- Okay, sure.
- Yes.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.000
Go ahead.

36:14.290 --> 36:15.750
Yeah, I'll head off.

36:16.580 --> 36:20.500
When Junhee comes,
let's all have a drink together.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.450
Yes, sure.

36:26.790 --> 36:27.750
See you later.

36:36.370 --> 36:38.120
Think about what I said, okay?

36:41.160 --> 36:42.200
I'm serious!

36:42.200 --> 36:44.200
- Let go, you're hurting me!
- Sorry.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.160
See you later.

36:47.540 --> 36:48.370
Wait for me.

36:49.330 --> 36:50.830
I might have to go.

36:50.870 --> 36:52.450
Come on.

36:53.330 --> 36:55.540
Bye.
Goodbye.

38:02.250 --> 38:10.080
When the wind blows,
and the sky is dark,

38:10.370 --> 38:17.830
when I yearn for the sight of you,

38:18.000 --> 38:25.500
When the wind blows,
and I'm feeling sad,

38:25.660 --> 38:31.870
thinking of beautiful you.

38:37.120 --> 38:42.700
Are you doing well?

38:44.700 --> 38:51.660
Do you live happily?

38:52.830 --> 38:59.290
Can you see my heart?

39:00.200 --> 39:06.200
Why has my mind fallen into this state?

39:09.500 --> 39:18.500
Can you see my heart?

39:19.290 --> 39:27.370
Why has my mind fallen into this state?

39:53.330 --> 39:54.540
Did you wait long?

39:54.740 --> 39:56.650
- You made it?
- Yeah.

39:57.170 --> 39:59.620
- What time is it?
- I didn't wait long.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.700
I didn't know it was so late.

40:05.910 --> 40:07.580
You okay?
It's so cold today.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.580
No it isn't, it's warm.

40:11.830 --> 40:14.830
But it's cold.
I'm really cold.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.620
I waited exactly an hour.

40:18.620 --> 40:21.040
Sorry about that.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.700
How have you been?
How did it turn out?

40:23.700 --> 40:26.000
How did what?

40:26.000 --> 40:29.200
I mean,
how have you been?

40:29.200 --> 40:34.330
I've been fine.
Have you been well?

40:34.330 --> 40:37.330
Me? So-so.

40:37.830 --> 40:41.290
- I'll go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

40:41.290 --> 40:43.450
- Want something warm?
- Yeah, great.

40:43.450 --> 40:46.120
Why's a big guy like you
feeling cold?

40:46.120 --> 40:47.820
Because it's cold,
that's why.

40:53.120 --> 40:57.410
May I have
some more coffee?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Yes, just a minute.

41:22.370 --> 41:26.540
- How's the coffee?
- It's fine.

41:26.540 --> 41:28.250
It's good.

41:28.250 --> 41:30.250
I'm glad.

41:31.250 --> 41:34.830
So how long have
you been back?

41:36.330 --> 41:39.330
You face has really changed.

41:40.290 --> 41:43.330
- You look older.
- Really?

41:43.330 --> 41:47.950
Well, I am old.

41:48.910 --> 41:52.290
You've gotten dark.

41:52.290 --> 41:54.750
Your skin used to be whiter.

41:54.750 --> 41:57.750
You think?
I don't think I've changed.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.750
No, you've gotten darker.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.370
Do you get health checks?

42:05.370 --> 42:08.330
No. Once, a long time ago.

42:08.330 --> 42:11.370
What year was it...?

42:11.370 --> 42:14.370
Was everything okay?

42:14.370 --> 42:16.080
Yeah, nothing in particular.

42:16.080 --> 42:21.370
My blood sugar was a bit high, and my
blood pressure. But nothing major at all.

42:21.370 --> 42:24.370
That can be dangerous.

42:25.410 --> 42:28.200
All right.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.790
And you,
is your health okay?

42:30.790 --> 42:33.790
I'm still young,
I'm fine.

42:35.620 --> 42:38.620
How old are you?

42:39.330 --> 42:41.000
I'm old too.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.540
Give me a break.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.410
How old are you really?

42:45.410 --> 42:48.120
If you forget every time,
why ask?

42:48.120 --> 42:49.750
I'm just curious.

42:52.080 --> 42:57.700
You should get married,
have a kid before it's too late.

42:58.500 --> 43:01.000
Me?

43:03.500 --> 43:06.500
I've got no man.

43:07.790 --> 43:10.790
Oh, really?

43:12.580 --> 43:13.950
Yes.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.620
Men are all idiots.

43:19.200 --> 43:22.200
- Really? Idiots?
- Yes, idiots.

43:24.160 --> 43:27.160
Yeah, you're right.

43:29.660 --> 43:33.000
Are you going to marry?

43:33.290 --> 43:34.160
Why?

43:34.160 --> 43:38.790
That woman there,
she looks like your wife.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.620
No, she's not my wife.

43:41.660 --> 43:42.500
We're just close.

43:42.540 --> 43:44.830
Then you're just friends?

43:45.700 --> 43:47.290
We're friends.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.540
It's been a while.

43:50.870 --> 43:54.500
What do you mean?
I saw you not long ago.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.000
Did you?

43:56.200 --> 43:58.540
Would you come help me?

43:59.040 --> 44:02.200
Wash the dishes, sort the beans.

44:02.330 --> 44:07.450
I do all the work here.
Don't be so thoughtless.

44:07.950 --> 44:10.200
All right, I'll do it.

44:10.450 --> 44:12.750
Are we just friends?

44:14.410 --> 44:16.410
What do you mean?

44:16.660 --> 44:20.000
That's what you said.
We're just friends?

44:22.580 --> 44:26.370
You can say we're friends.

44:26.620 --> 44:31.250
We're friendly, right?
That makes us friends.

44:31.250 --> 44:34.450
Now you're playing with words?

44:34.700 --> 44:36.950
Wash the dishes now!

44:38.120 --> 44:40.410
Friends should help each other.

44:40.410 --> 44:43.410
Or think of me as a maid.

44:43.660 --> 44:48.200
All right, I'll do it.

44:54.580 --> 44:55.620
Got a headache?

44:55.750 --> 44:57.750
A bit.

44:57.750 --> 45:01.040
He always whines about his head.
Every day.

45:01.040 --> 45:04.040
But he still drinks
himself stupid.

45:05.950 --> 45:10.500
Stop it, will you?
It really hurts.

45:12.620 --> 45:15.830
- Do you have pain relievers?
- No, I'm fine.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.280
I've got some.

45:20.755 --> 45:23.176
It looks really painful.

45:23.259 --> 45:25.952
A bit.

45:26.540 --> 45:28.330
Want some air?

45:28.330 --> 45:31.330
Let's go outside
for some air.

45:37.290 --> 45:39.750
Shall we?

45:43.290 --> 45:45.540
You want to see upstairs?

45:45.540 --> 45:46.950
What's upstairs?

45:47.080 --> 45:48.870
Nothing now,

45:49.120 --> 45:52.950
but it used to be
a gallery and concert space.

45:52.950 --> 45:54.370
- Want to see?
- Really?

45:54.370 --> 45:57.200
I'll see it next time.

45:57.540 --> 45:59.160
Really?

45:59.540 --> 46:01.750
Are you hungry?
Want to eat?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.580
- I am a bit hungry.
- Then...

46:04.950 --> 46:06.870
Sort these.

46:07.500 --> 46:10.370
All right.
I'll do it soon.

46:10.370 --> 46:14.000
What do you mean, soon?
Do it now!

46:14.200 --> 46:16.620
Sort them so we can roast.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.120
We're not going to roast them?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.000
Sure, all right.

46:21.250 --> 46:23.200
I'll do it soon.

46:29.620 --> 46:32.950
Okay, you're right.
I'll do it now.

46:33.910 --> 46:37.410
I'll go have a smoke.
It's too noisy here.

46:44.330 --> 46:46.370
Hurry up.

46:47.370 --> 46:49.370
Are we really out of beans?

46:49.620 --> 46:51.870
Go look, we're out.

46:52.500 --> 46:55.290
Go look yourself.

46:55.540 --> 46:58.290
Isn't this your job?

47:01.910 --> 47:04.370
All right,
I'll do it now.

47:07.620 --> 47:09.000
Give me the sheet.

47:33.700 --> 47:36.200
Eat when you're done.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.830
What's to eat?

47:38.870 --> 47:41.290
I brought tuna kimbap.

47:42.790 --> 47:45.000
Sounds good.

47:45.250 --> 47:49.120
If you want something hot,
I can buy noodles.

47:51.500 --> 47:52.870
Noodles would be good.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.450
Choose one, then.

47:54.950 --> 48:00.830
We can put kimbap in the fridge
and have it for dinner.

48:00.830 --> 48:03.040
We could.

48:04.790 --> 48:06.450
What should we eat?

48:07.450 --> 48:08.790
You decide.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.250
What are you doing?

49:01.250 --> 49:02.500
Yes?

49:02.660 --> 49:05.000
- I finished the beans.
- They're all sorted?

49:05.000 --> 49:07.620
- You're hungry?
- A bit.

49:07.620 --> 49:09.620
Let's not wait for Junhee,
we can eat now.

49:09.620 --> 49:11.500
I agree.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.200
Younghee. Here.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.580
- Just a little, I'm drunk.
- You feeling drunk?

49:47.580 --> 49:50.250
My head is spinning a little.

49:50.250 --> 49:53.580
I hardly ever drink,
so it goes right to my head.

49:53.580 --> 49:55.040
You haven't been drinking?

49:55.120 --> 49:58.370
Not many occasions
to drink there.

49:59.660 --> 50:03.160
-Want some?
- Yeah.

50:03.450 --> 50:06.290
But you've developed
a real charm.

50:06.290 --> 50:07.120
You know that?

50:07.120 --> 50:08.290
- Me?
- Yeah.

50:08.290 --> 50:11.910
She's always been pretty.
A true beauty.

50:11.910 --> 50:14.370
I didn't say beauty,
I said charm.

50:15.080 --> 50:20.540
Her emotional struggle
changed something inside her.

50:21.290 --> 50:23.250
I don't know.

50:23.250 --> 50:25.950
No, it's true.
Something's different.

50:25.950 --> 50:30.120
I said so earlier,
that you look mature.

50:30.250 --> 50:33.000
- She's become very womanly.
- That's right.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.160
Even if I struggle,
I don't get prettier.

50:37.410 --> 50:40.120
What are you talking about, really?

50:40.250 --> 50:44.000
He caused me so much struggle,
I've gotten older.

50:44.700 --> 50:46.450
I did?

50:46.450 --> 50:49.580
You're charming,
we all know that.

50:49.700 --> 50:51.370
Really?

50:51.370 --> 50:54.330
- Am I really charming?
- Of course!

50:54.830 --> 50:56.410
Charming how?

50:56.660 --> 50:58.000
A strong personality.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.450
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:59.450 --> 51:01.790
Totally strong,
I agree.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.500
- All right!
- Drink up.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.870
You happy?

51:05.370 --> 51:08.120
Younghee.

51:13.040 --> 51:16.540
What was most fun there?

51:16.540 --> 51:19.160
Most fun?

51:19.410 --> 51:22.370
I walked a lot every day.

51:22.750 --> 51:27.370
There's a park.
I really liked it there.

51:28.910 --> 51:30.160
And a bakery too.

51:30.160 --> 51:34.830
I spent hours there each day.

51:35.790 --> 51:42.750
On my way home,
I bought fried fish in cartons.

51:42.950 --> 51:46.120
So I ate like that,

51:46.250 --> 51:52.250
economizing on coffee
to save money.

51:52.830 --> 51:56.000
- Oh my.
- Is that so?

51:56.500 --> 52:01.410
It was the same every day.
But it was so peaceful.

52:02.000 --> 52:09.500
Things I couldn't feel in Seoul,
I began to feel there, bit by bit.

52:10.250 --> 52:14.250
Sometimes the loneliness
made me tremble.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.870
But there's pleasure
in that too.

52:18.950 --> 52:20.700
Did you meet any guys?

52:24.040 --> 52:25.870
Guess so.

52:25.870 --> 52:27.790
Tell us.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.330
Guys who approached me?
There were a lot.

52:33.450 --> 52:37.200
In the bakery
or on the street.

52:37.200 --> 52:46.000
But it was just so predictable
I couldn't do it.

52:46.580 --> 52:49.830
Why not?
You've got desire, too.

52:49.950 --> 52:52.200
Sure I do.

52:53.540 --> 52:55.330
I did slip up once.

52:56.580 --> 52:59.080
Actually a few times, but...

53:02.330 --> 53:05.200
It'll ruin me if I don't stop.

53:06.620 --> 53:14.200
If I'm going to die, do it graciously.
That's the feeling that came to me.

53:14.450 --> 53:16.290
Hey, how are the guys there?

53:16.660 --> 53:18.370
Aren't they better
than guys here?

53:18.370 --> 53:22.200
- Guys are all the same.
- No they aren't.

53:23.370 --> 53:25.620
They have nice bodies.

53:25.620 --> 53:27.830
And they're kind.

53:28.910 --> 53:30.080
And big down there.

53:30.330 --> 53:33.750
Really?
Wait, are they really big?

53:33.750 --> 53:35.700
- Stop.
- Quiet, you.

53:35.700 --> 53:36.790
Really big.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.370
No comparison.

53:39.620 --> 53:41.540
Really? So it is...

53:41.540 --> 53:43.330
It's really true.

53:43.330 --> 53:47.790
They have nice bodies,
but inside they're the same.

53:48.830 --> 53:51.000
Men all want
the same thing.

53:52.120 --> 53:55.830
- But did you really hold back?
- I didn't hold back.

53:55.830 --> 53:59.330
But if I meet guys that way,

53:59.330 --> 54:06.040
I worry that later I'll end up a
strange, man-obsessed woman,

54:06.040 --> 54:08.790
like a monster.

54:10.410 --> 54:12.910
Die graciously!

54:14.000 --> 54:19.580
Are you still searching for love?

54:21.500 --> 54:26.200
Where's love?
It's not even visible.

54:27.620 --> 54:31.000
You need to see it
in order to search for it.

54:34.290 --> 54:37.790
You know how charming you are?

54:43.330 --> 54:46.330
- I'm not charming.
- Stop it!

54:47.160 --> 54:49.790
You really are.

54:52.410 --> 54:59.160
Anyway, I've tried everything.
I've really done it all.

54:59.620 --> 55:03.500
When I die,
I just want to die.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.910
Well...

55:10.330 --> 55:15.250
I don't want to think of
worthless things.

55:15.370 --> 55:18.040
I can just die anytime.

55:18.040 --> 55:23.250
I'd like to just
fade away graciously.

55:23.370 --> 55:24.580
lt's 100 times better!

55:24.580 --> 55:29.830
Younghee,
I've thought that way too.

55:29.830 --> 55:32.830
But isn't it better to live?

55:33.500 --> 55:35.450
That's why everyone keeps living.

55:35.700 --> 55:41.540
It's not according to your thought,
but just a will to live.

55:42.040 --> 55:45.200
Don't pretend to be wise.

55:45.330 --> 55:48.450
Always floundering
in thoughts.

55:48.950 --> 55:50.120
Who, me?

55:52.250 --> 55:56.540
You can't love,
so you cling to life, right?

55:57.830 --> 56:00.750
Because you can't love for real,

56:01.500 --> 56:03.870
you take that at least.

56:04.790 --> 56:06.200
Am I wrong?

56:06.500 --> 56:09.250
That's what I do?

56:14.580 --> 56:17.750
But you can't love.

56:18.540 --> 56:20.000
You know?

56:22.120 --> 56:27.450
You're not capable of love,
or don't deserve to be loved.

56:28.330 --> 56:31.450
But we all sing about love.

56:33.620 --> 56:37.000
Have you ever really seen
a person qualified to love?

56:37.950 --> 56:40.410
You need a qualification?

56:41.290 --> 56:45.290
Can't we just love?
Why get hung up on qualifications?

56:46.330 --> 56:49.700
So people with nothing,
they aren't allowed to love?

56:51.000 --> 56:55.450
If you don't know anything,
keep your mouth shut.

56:55.450 --> 56:57.370
Younghee's drunk.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.540
Keep my mouth shut?

57:00.660 --> 57:03.120
You shouldn't speak that way.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.250
Don't you start, too.

57:05.290 --> 57:07.410
Just keep your mouth shut!

57:08.660 --> 57:10.540
None of you are qualified!

57:11.910 --> 57:15.580
Everyone's cowardly,
satisfied with fake things,

57:15.910 --> 57:18.040
and engaging in dirty acts.

57:18.540 --> 57:22.290
You're all happy living that way.
You're not qualified to love!

57:32.410 --> 57:34.790
What will you do?

57:36.910 --> 57:39.160
Who's going to love you?

57:40.160 --> 57:41.450
What?

57:41.700 --> 57:46.000
Who's going to love
such a pretty girl?

57:48.540 --> 57:50.790
You.
Let's love each other.

57:51.160 --> 57:53.540
We can do that,
can't we?

57:53.540 --> 57:57.620
Shall we?
Let's do that.

57:58.660 --> 58:02.540
I'm not qualified to love,
but I will.

58:02.540 --> 58:05.120
No, you can love.

58:05.620 --> 58:11.370
Let's get rid of all the men,
and love each other.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.290
I want to kiss you.

58:14.950 --> 58:16.830
Can I kiss you?

58:17.500 --> 58:19.000
Shall we?

58:22.750 --> 58:24.080
That's nice.

58:24.080 --> 58:25.700
Once again.

58:33.910 --> 58:35.250
I'm liking this.

58:35.540 --> 58:36.750
Us too!

58:36.750 --> 58:38.580
What do you mean?

58:38.910 --> 58:40.370
Why are you doing this?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.290
What's with you?

58:51.540 --> 58:53.000
Hey! Oh, my.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.370
Stop this, let's drink.
I'm feeling left out.

58:59.370 --> 59:00.500
You feel sad?

59:00.500 --> 59:02.000
Give me a kiss?

59:02.250 --> 59:04.410
You're not qualified.

59:04.870 --> 59:06.830
But I want to kiss.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.290
Do it with your cup.
It's your lips anyway.

59:11.580 --> 59:12.620
Whatever.

59:12.620 --> 59:14.000
We're having fun!

59:14.660 --> 59:16.120
Isn't this fun?

59:16.660 --> 59:18.660
It's great to see you
all again.

59:18.660 --> 59:21.660
- It really is.
- Me too.

59:22.120 --> 59:25.540
Don't go,
just live here.

59:25.540 --> 59:28.040
Should I?
Should I live here?

59:28.040 --> 59:29.580
Sure.

59:29.580 --> 59:33.160
Forget all men.
I'll be your friend.

59:33.160 --> 59:36.620
- You'll be my friend?
- Sure, friends for life.

59:36.620 --> 59:39.370
Junhee, this won't do.
Give me a kiss.

59:40.750 --> 59:42.790
Forget it,
let's run away.

59:42.790 --> 59:44.700
Now my feelings are hurt.

59:44.700 --> 59:46.580
Let's go, quick.

59:56.950 --> 01:00:02.750
You know, I've been...
That poet, Park Jongha.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:06.370
It's not that Park Jongha,
right?

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.000
- I don't think so.
- Right?

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.450
Cast it off.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.750
Stifling love too
must be cast and thrown off.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:27.660
The longing that grips you,
scrub and wash it away.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.500
The restless pain of separation

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.000
And the greater anguish of meeting.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.700
Cast it from your mind,

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:44.250
Peel it off
and throw it to the wind.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.580
Why does Myungsoo
look so weak?

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:56.200
After meeting that woman
he suddenly got old.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.080
He looks like he's given up.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.910
So that's it.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.870
But everyone's
moving here from Seoul.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:12.410
They can't survive in Seoul.
Same with me.

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.410
No, I think you're different.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.950
I can't survive either.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.620
All failures...

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:30.580
The jerks who succeed,
who show off, they're all failures.

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.580
I don't know about
success and failure.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.410
Yeah, what's success?
It's just an expression.

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:48.620
Did you want success?

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.200
No, I just wanted to enjoy life.
I didn't want success.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.580
But in the end,
people make you run like that.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.335
What I really wanted was to pursue
something passionately.

01:02:09.468 --> 01:02:13.250
- Like study.
- I want to study, too.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:17.370
I never had the chance,
but now I want to.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.410
- Studying clears your mind.
- Right, it does!

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:30.200
I want to be with you forever.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.040
I wish you wouldn't go back!

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.750
Thank you.
Thanks so much.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.120
No, I'm thankful to you.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.500
It was my first kiss
with a woman!

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.870
Me too.

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.410
It felt weird!

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.290
But it was fun.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.290
- No more kisses, now.
- Okay.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.750
All right.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.540
Younghee...

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:05.250
This is the money
you loaned me.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:09.120
I kept meaning to pay you back.
Sorry I'm late.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.160
You remembered that?

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.580
I kept meaning to pay,
and kept forgetting.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.580
Sorry.
So I added a bit of interest.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.540
Seriously?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.700
It's not much.
Buy a present.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.120
To commemorate your return.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.700
How much did you add?

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.330
It's not much.
Just another $100.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.500
I borrowed $400 back then?

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:46.040
Right.
I had forgotten it.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.120
Sorry for being so late.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.950
Not at all.
I'll buy a present, thanks.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:54.450
It's nothing.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.950
- You got money!
- Yes!

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.610
It's cold, let's go in.

01:03:58.651 --> 01:03:59.649
Yeah.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:00.549
Let's go.

01:04:00.651 --> 01:04:03.700
- Come on.
- I'll just smoke a cigarette.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.700
Okay.

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:08.160
- Thank you.
- No, it's nothing.

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:23.160
It's cold out there.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.080
What's with her?

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.700
- She got money.
- I got money!

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:40.330
Myungsoo had borrowed $400,
and he paid back an extra $100.

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:43.250
- Did you remember?
- No, I'd forgotten.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:27.250
- They have places like this here?
- It's nice, isn't it?

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.660
Such a big hotel for
such a secluded place.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.790
Yes, I thought the same.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:40.930
- Which floor?
- Just a second.

01:05:41.758 --> 01:05:45.360
- Room 311. Third floor.
- Okay.

01:05:56.830 --> 01:06:00.330
Hey, this room's pretty.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:01.830
It's nice.

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:03.620
It's big.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.540
Bigger than the room
I had before.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:11.500
Really?
It feels too big to use myself.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.000
No, it's fine.
It's the same price.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.410
It's really cheap
with the discount.

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:19.290
Still, it's huge.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:23.620
The smaller rooms are all out,
but this is the same price.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.660
- Thanks, Junhee!
- It's nothing.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.700
This is so nice,
I can see the ocean.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.950
That's refreshing.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:40.580
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's great.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.200
There are three rooms.
Too big to use alone.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:47.080
- Really? Three rooms?
- Yes, three.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.910
It'll be scary at night.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.120
It might be.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.290
It's got everything here.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:01.120
- No electric range?
- It's not in the cupboard?

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.450
Why isn't it here?

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:13.080
We'll have to buy some things.
Water and snacks.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.910
Shall we?
Is there a store near by?

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:18.040
Yes, a convenience store downstairs.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:20.250
You hungry?

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.160
A bit.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.790
Should we buy something?

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.080
Let's.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.000
You stay,
we'll be right back.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.950
- Really? I can come.
- No, just relax.

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:33.450
- Okay.
- You want anything?

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:37.330
Would you buy me a beer?
Let's drink beers.

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:39.700
During the day?
After last night?

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.370
Drinking a little
will make us feel better.

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:43.830
As you wish.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.040
Do you need anything else?

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:51.468
Something hot.
If there's porridge, buy some.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.197
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:07:53.232 --> 01:07:54.399
See you.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.700
I've come to really like
apples these days.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.200
- You didn't like them before?
- No.

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.870
I couldn't stand
anything sour.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:51.160
I only ate sweet fruit.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.500
Let me try one.

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:56.620
It's sweet.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:58.700
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.080
I'm thinking about
working with Younghee.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.910
She's got no agency,
so I can answer the phone, or drive.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.160
I can do that.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.330
Sure, you can do that well.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.870
You help her get started.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.580
I'd like to keep doing it.

01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:26.330
I've done enough
at my current job.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.790
I think I can go on
with Younghee forever.

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:32.500
That would be nice.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.330
You're a good match.

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:39.040
- I think so.
- Yeah.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.450
I hope it works.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.290
But she agreed
to move back?

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.040
That's what she told me.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.330
Good for her.

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:58.160
What happened to that director?
You hear anything?

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.370
The guy she dated.

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:06.450
Don't think he's making films.
Did he move to Jeju?

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.910
I think I heard that.

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:14.200
A friend of mine saw him,
and said he's totally fallen apart.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.450
He's fallen apart?

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:20.540
She said he looked
like a total wreck.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.040
Oh my...

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.750
They really liked each other?
Seeing what they did?

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.540
Yeah.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.000
But why such a fuss?

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:39.500
Just leave them alone,
why stir up such a fuss?

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.250
People have nothing to do.
And it's adultery.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.000
People must've had fun,
raking them over the coals.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:57.330
They can act cruel,
but two people in love is immoral?

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.500
I feel bad for Younghee.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.790
Let's be good to her.

01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:05.290
I'll be her friend for life.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.250
Sure,
you do that.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.540
Thank you.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.410
You're welcome.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:54.660
- It's good.
- Is it?

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:57.450
I think it's better than before.

01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:00.540
Korean beer is much better now.

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.000
- Right.
- That's right.

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:05.700
It's good.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.660
It really is.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.290
I'm glad.

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:11.660
- Shall we toast?
- Shall we?

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.330
- Let's.
- Okay.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.620
To what?

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.660
Her return!

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.160
Cheers.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.200
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.200
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.250
I'll go cook some spam.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.120
- Okay.
- Really?

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.080
- Want help?
- Yes.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.700
Tomorrow I'll come
as soon as I can.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:14.080
Okay.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.450
But it'll probably be 2:00.

01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:20.330
You can just sleep here...

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.000
I was planning to.
Damn.

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.620
I just can't cancel
tonight's appointment.

01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:31.830
- Sorry.
- No need to say sorry.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.700
What'll you do?

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:38.200
It's fine, I'll take a walk,
or read a book.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.620
Really?

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:42.620
I read a lot these days.
It's fun.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:47.580
Sure, read a lot.
It's good for you.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.370
Recommend me
some books.

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:52.120
Sure, I will.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:55.120
Visit bookstores often.

01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:58.450
Make it a habit,
then you'll find good books.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:04.290
And buy what you'll read for sure,
and dig into them.

01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:08.450
Attack books
like you're fighting.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.500
Don't read them casually.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.370
Right, we mustn't be superficial.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.000
You're so smart.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.200
You're the smart one.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.750
No, you're smart, not me.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:27.200
No, you're smart.
You're really smart.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.540
You're instinctually smart.

01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:32.910
- Instinctually?
- Yes.

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:34.410
Thanks.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.540
- It's all done.
- Really?

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:39.330
Put them here.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:40.620
Thanks.

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.120
Wake up.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.580
It's dangerous.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.620
What is it?

01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:25.160
I'm An Seunghee.
His assistant director.

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:28.590
Do you remember me?

01:17:28.665 --> 01:17:30.448
Yes, I do.

01:17:31.243 --> 01:17:33.610
Funny seeing you here.

01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:37.219
We saw you before.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.500
You didn't notice us?

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.250
I saw you starting a fire.

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:46.040
But what are you doing here?

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.790
Location hunting.

01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:49.250
Arrived yesterday.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.250
Out here in this cold...

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.330
It's nothing.

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:55.870
Thanks for what you did then.

01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:58.580
No, it was no big deal.

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:06.500
Want to stand by the fire?

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.700
You look cold.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.290
Shall I?

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.200
Who's there?

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.160
The second ADs
and the production team.

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.620
Nobody there knows.

01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:28.200
Go on,
you must be cold.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.370
- Shall I?
- Yes.

01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:37.870
But how'd you know
I was here?

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:40.200
We didn't.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.200
- You didn't, right?
- Right.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.080
This is too funny.

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:47.830
Isn't it?

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.620
Is the director doing well?

01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.700
He finished the screenplay,
and cast one actor.

01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:05.370
We hope to start shooting
next month.

01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.250
I see.

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.160
How is his health?

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:15.290
It wasn't very good,
but it improved a lot.

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:23.250
For a year he had awful headaches,
but now he's able to shoot again.

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:26.660
Did he come with you?

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:29.830
- Yes, he did.
- Really?

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.000
I see.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.580
Where is he?

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.330
Is he here now?

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:40.830
It's only us here.

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:46.080
After eating we decided
to have a beer by the sea.

01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:50.830
The director stayed
in the motel to rest.

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:53.000
I see...

01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.500
Hello!

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:01.740
Oh, we were right.

01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:03.670
Yes, hello.

01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.740
- Good to see you.
- Yes, it is.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:07.940
Hello.

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:11.810
We were worried,
seeing you lying there.

01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:16.390
You were worried?

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.590
Yes, it's so cold.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.990
I've heard so much about you.
I'm a real fan.

01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:28.170
Oh really?
What do you do?

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:31.370
This time,
script supervisor.

01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:32.770
I see.

01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:36.360
So you'll shoot here?

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.120
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.890
Here and in Gangneung,
mostly.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.240
I see.

01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.500
And what do you do?

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.660
I'm a second AD.

01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:49.570
You look a bit old,
you're still second AD?

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.910
I am really old.
I wanted to work with the director.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.340
Just one more time.

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.310
I'm Kang Sungwoo,
production team.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.450
I'm a big fan of yours.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.280
Thank you.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.850
He really is a huge fan.
He likes you a lot.

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.490
- Really?
- Yes.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:17.410
Won't you shoot more films?
I want to see your acting.

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:21.520
Yes, I'd like to.
Not sure how I'll do.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.090
You'll do well.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.220
You really will.
Do it for sure.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.360
Here, have one.

01:21:29.410 --> 01:21:32.010
A beer?
I don't like beer much.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.750
I'll take one.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.590
These days,
the beer has gotten better.

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:41.620
Yes, it's true.

01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:44.960
Where's mine?

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.160
Here it is.

01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:49.800
Shall we?

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:53.460
- It's nice and warm here.
- Yes.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.100
- Let's toast!
- Yes.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.820
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.110
- Tastes good.
- Does it?

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.410
Yes, it does.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.470
- Is she coming?
- Yes.

01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:20.780
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:29.240
- You have the key to his room?
- Yeah.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.410
- Why?
- He said to bring a book.

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.110
Which book?

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.760
- The one in his room.
- I see.

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.930
Want to go together?

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:46.860
I'd like that.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.710
Let's go.

01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.470
Okay.

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:10.090
I've heard so much about you.

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.090
What did you hear?

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.490
He praised you a lot.

01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:20.560
Said you're a great actress.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.230
That's not like him.

01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.730
He never praises anyone.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.070
I don't?
That's not true.

01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:31.810
No, you never do.

01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:34.580
Do I not praise anyone?

01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:38.410
You do.
You praise people often.

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:41.950
See, they agree.
Why are you making stuff up?

01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:44.090
What praise did he give me?

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:52.130
That you're a very talented actress.
He always says so, and...

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:55.800
it's such a shame
you don't act.

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:58.930
You said that?

01:24:59.230 --> 01:25:00.140
Yeah.

01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:04.070
What do you mean,
a shame?

01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:06.070
It's true.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:13.980
I'm going to shoot a film.
I received a script, when I was there.

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.580
Really? When?

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.350
A while back.

01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:20.290
I said I wouldn't do it.

01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:22.920
- Why not?
- It's garbage.

01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:26.960
Who's the director?

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.230
I don't know.

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:39.240
It's a debut director,
desperate to make money.

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:43.650
Good job.
You'll get another.

01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:47.850
I'll have to take
anything later.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.590
If no scripts come.

01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:53.190
Why wouldn't you
receive scripts?

01:25:57.230 --> 01:26:00.100
I think you know the reason.

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:03.100
I'm a bomb,
a bomb!

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.630
What do you mean,
a bomb?

01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:08.870
- I've got a destructive side.
- No you don't.

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:10.510
I'm destructive!

01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:13.270
I harass people
and destroy everything!

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.750
It seems she's having
a tough day today.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.220
No, I'm like this
every day.

01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:29.220
Thank you, Director.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.360
Why, all of a sudden?

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:34.260
Just, for everything.

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:40.800
You loved me so much!

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.100
So I'm thankful.

01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:52.310
It was because
you're so pretty.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.220
I'm pretty?

01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:57.520
Am I really pretty?

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.350
Of course...

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:02.060
Isn't she?

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.410
She's Pretty.

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:05.190
Very pretty.

01:27:05.190 --> 01:27:09.730
Then, am I prettier
than Mari here?

01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:11.770
Of course you are.

01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:15.470
The script girl is pretty too.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.540
Why so many pretty women
around you?

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.510
I like working with
pretty people.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.580
Younghee,
you're pretty.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.490
You're really pretty.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.460
I don't feel very grateful.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.130
You've gotten older.

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:42.800
Have I?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.500
You're like a grandfather,
all of a sudden.

01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:57.080
But you're just as
pretty as before.

01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:00.950
I'm older too.
I've gotten older?

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.690
Director,
here's the book.

01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:10.290
Okay, thanks.

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:11.690
Which book?

01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:19.970
You said you like books these days.
So I thought of this.

01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:23.270
You're giving it to me?

01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:27.340
Yes, well... in a bit.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.910
Will you?

01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:34.520
You must cherish the book,
to hide it like that.

01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:39.520
You don't need to
give it to me.

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.290
I will.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.600
I think you'll need it.

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.670
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.710
You got a girlfriend
these days?

01:29:05.410 --> 01:29:06.410
No.

01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:11.950
I'll just make films,
nothing else.

01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:13.020
- Really?
- Yes.

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.090
So what film are you
going to make?

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.490
About a person I've loved.

01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:24.370
It's just going to
be shaped by that experience.

01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:28.160
Personal stories are boring.

01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:35.900
It's boring to talk about
yourself all the time, isn't it?

01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:40.400
But it's also important
how it's made.

01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:42.870
That's right.
The subject isn't important.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.110
- Really?
- Yes.

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:50.660
How are you
going to make it?

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:58.420
Just as the thought comes to me.
To not set anything in advance.

01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:03.620
So I shoot the first scene
and go where it takes me...

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.160
Why do you make
those films?

01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:09.860
Why make it about
someone you loved?

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:13.430
Trying to lessen your torment?

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.140
My torment?

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.510
Perhaps.

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.010
Are you tormented?

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.460
Yes, a bit.

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:30.420
I haven't been normal
since then.

01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:32.320
No.

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:36.960
You seem normal.
Even shooting films.

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.930
I make films
but I'm not normal!

01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:47.870
I've been turning
into a monster.

01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:54.170
- Don't be a monster!
- So I'm trying to cast that off.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.710
I need to cast off my regrets.

01:30:57.710 --> 01:31:00.750
You regret it?
Do you really regret it?

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.320
Yes, I do.

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.920
I constantly regret it.
Every day, so much it makes me sick.

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.170
Don't regret it!

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.740
Regretting won't change anything.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.710
What if I can't stop regretting?

01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:32.440
This pain, this constant regret...
You think I want this?

01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:42.260
But with time...

01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:45.760
...it turns sweet,

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:52.130
so I don't want to go back.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:59.140
I just want to die
with my regret.

01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:07.510
I can't breathe...

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.200
You want to read this?

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:38.410
No, I'll read it to you.

01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:47.302
I really wanted
to read this to you.

01:32:48.048 --> 01:32:49.060
Listen.

01:32:50.868 --> 01:32:53.626
"The time has come to separate.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.744
When our eyes met in that cabin
our self-restraint deserted us.

01:32:59.745 --> 01:33:04.175
I took her in my arms,
she pressed her face to my breast.

01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:11.240
Tears flowed from her eyes.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:18.150
Kissing her face, shoulders, and
tear-soaked hands, we were truly...

01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:23.160
unhappy.

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:31.130
I confessed my love for her,
and with a burning pain in my heart

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:38.260
I realized how unnecessary,
how petty and how deceptive

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:43.140
all that had hindered us
from loving was.

01:33:45.710 --> 01:33:48.310
When you love,

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:55.190
you must, in your reasonings about
that love, start from what is highest,

01:33:55.620 --> 01:34:02.960
from what is more important than
happiness or unhappiness,

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.560
or that sin or virtue in
their accepted meaning,

01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:10.400
otherwise...

01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:17.180
you must not reason at all,
I realized then."

01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:26.610
Give me the book.

01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:37.660
Here?

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.560
Yes.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:43.910
Did you like it?

01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:46.940
Isn't it good?

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.380
- It's great.
- Yes.

01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.310
- My reading was poor.
- Not at all.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.680
It was good.

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.180
You're giving it to me?

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.510
I'll go smoke a cigarette.

01:35:22.710 --> 01:35:24.360
Wasn't that a good passage?

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:28.808
- It was really great.
- Yes.

01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:41.060
Wake up!
