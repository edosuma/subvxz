00:03.600 --> 00:05.500
(male narrator)
Previously,
on a very special Clone High...

00:05.500 --> 00:07.833
I'll sleep when I die.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.800
You'll die
if you don't sleep!

00:09.800 --> 00:11.600
[tires screech]
[crash]

00:11.600 --> 00:14.200
I was thinking
we could sleep together.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.533
[laughs]

00:15.533 --> 00:18.233
(announcer)
And that was really something.

00:18.233 --> 00:19.833
But it's crap compared to

00:19.833 --> 00:24.367
this very special episode
of Clone High.

00:24.367 --> 00:27.100
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:27.100 --> 00:29.967
* Secret government employees

00:29.967 --> 00:32.867
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:32.867 --> 00:35.833
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:35.833 --> 00:38.700
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:38.700 --> 00:41.667
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:41.667 --> 00:44.400
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:44.400 --> 00:50.833
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:50.833 --> 00:53.700
* Clone High

00:53.700 --> 00:56.400
* Clone High

00:56.400 --> 00:59.233
*

00:59.233 --> 01:01.067
Hello, it is I,
Dan Patrick,

01:01.067 --> 01:02.233
here with Chris Berman.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.400
Welcome to the Clone High
High School pep rally

01:04.400 --> 01:06.700
as they prepare
for the big homecoming game

01:06.700 --> 01:07.867
against archrival GESH.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.267
Word, Dan.

01:09.267 --> 01:11.800
GESH--that's Genetically
Engineered Superhuman High--

01:11.800 --> 01:14.067
has dominated this storied
three-year rivalry.

01:14.067 --> 01:18.067
You said an expository mouthful,
my versatile friend.

01:18.067 --> 01:20.067
Clone High has yet to score
a single point on GESH.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.500
That may change

01:21.500 --> 01:23.933
thanks to their new and
extremely untested captain,

01:23.933 --> 01:26.300
Abe "Weakest" Lincoln.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.633
And here comes Ghandi as
school mascot DNA Dan.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.933
And now DNA Dan
will unfurl

01:32.933 --> 01:35.133
the traditional homecoming
spirit banner.

01:35.133 --> 01:38.067
My sources tell me this year,
it's going to say,

01:38.067 --> 01:39.433
"Clone High Rules," Chris.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.800
[reading to themselves]

01:42.800 --> 01:44.100
[both gasp]

01:44.100 --> 01:45.100
Dear God.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.100
The inspirational banner

01:46.100 --> 01:48.067
has been defaced
by GESH, Chris.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.533
I've never seen a worse
atrocity, Dan,

01:50.533 --> 01:52.433
and let me remind you
I was in that movie

01:52.433 --> 01:55.333
where Whoopi Goldberg
coached the Knicks.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.100
Hey, Chris,
we've sure provided

01:57.100 --> 01:58.800
a lot of background
information, haven't we?

01:58.800 --> 02:00.233
We sure have, Dan.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.633
The odd thing is, my mic
isn't even plugged in.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.100
That's nothing, Chris.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.400
I've been talking into my fist
for the last five minutes.

02:07.733 --> 02:09.267
Ghandi is pissed, yo.

02:09.267 --> 02:11.733
I worked my beige ass off
on that banner.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.667
I'm going to get those
GESH freaks back,

02:13.667 --> 02:16.067
because if Mahatma Ghandi
stands for anything,

02:16.067 --> 02:17.733
it's revenge!

02:17.733 --> 02:20.533
[intense scream]

02:20.533 --> 02:22.300
Ghandi's scream
was right.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.667
The stakes were here.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.967
But now they're here.

02:25.967 --> 02:28.433
Those GESH hoodlums
are going to feel the wrath

02:28.433 --> 02:31.967
of 104 pounds of
all-beef captain.

02:31.967 --> 02:36.400
And the wrath of 105 pounds
of grade-A girl meat.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.433
I'm playing on the team
this year, captain.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.700
[laughs]

02:39.700 --> 02:40.800
Oh, Joan.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.233
You know the rules.

02:42.233 --> 02:45.200
No girls or animals
can play on the boys' teams.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.333
But I beat you
every time we play.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.067
You were keeping score?

02:49.067 --> 02:50.200
Ugh!

02:50.200 --> 02:52.967
Joan, wait.

02:52.967 --> 02:55.133
Maybe you should try on
my letterman's jacket.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.133
You mean--

02:56.133 --> 02:57.567
That's right, Joan.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.867
I'm giving it to Cleo
at the homecoming prom,

02:59.867 --> 03:01.833
and I want to see
how it fits a girl.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.400
What makes you think
Cleo wants your jacket?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.833
You had one date with her,
and she went home with JFK!

03:06.833 --> 03:09.067
Her house is more
on his way home.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.867
[grunts]

03:15.467 --> 03:17.467
[crashing, grinding]

03:20.900 --> 03:23.067
I may be blind,

03:23.067 --> 03:24.300
but I can still hear someone

03:24.300 --> 03:25.900
not following through
on her jump shot.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.633
What's troubling you, Joan?

03:27.633 --> 03:30.967
Oh, Toots, I know I could help
the boys' basketball team,

03:30.967 --> 03:34.367
but the rules don't allow
girls or animals.

03:34.367 --> 03:35.600
[grunts]

03:35.600 --> 03:38.600
Joanie, you may find this
hard to believe,

03:38.600 --> 03:42.567
but there was a time
before racism was eradicated

03:42.567 --> 03:46.233
when they wouldn't let black
folks play organized sports.

03:46.233 --> 03:49.200
So racism kept you
from playing pro basketball?

03:49.200 --> 03:52.800
Yes, Joan.
Yes, it did.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.200
Over here.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.967
Yes, Joan.
Yes, it did.

03:57.967 --> 04:01.200
As usual, your words have
inspired me, Toots.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.900
I know just what I'm gonna do.

04:05.933 --> 04:08.833
Ha! Still got it.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.633
Ooh!

04:10.633 --> 04:12.267
(Principal Scudworth)
Colonel Principal,

04:12.267 --> 04:14.833
my counterpart at GESH.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.700
We meet again.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.500
I say, Scudworth,

04:18.500 --> 04:22.633
I reckon it's time
for our annual wager.

04:22.633 --> 04:25.133
[slurps]
That's good julep.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.733
Now, I'm a sportin' man,

04:26.733 --> 04:29.067
so this year,
I'm willing to bet

04:29.067 --> 04:31.500
that your puny clones
can't even score

04:31.500 --> 04:33.733
a single point off of my boys.

04:33.733 --> 04:38.067
What? My clones will wipe
the floor with your mutants.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.067
In this instance,
"wipe the floor"

04:40.067 --> 04:41.367
means "score a point on."

04:41.367 --> 04:44.133
What would you
care to wager?

04:44.133 --> 04:45.733
Last year,
if you recall,

04:45.733 --> 04:47.867
I won your
first-born child.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.567
You leave Brian out of it.

04:50.567 --> 04:54.400
No, let's up the ante.

04:54.400 --> 04:59.167
Loser does
the winner's laundry...

04:59.167 --> 05:00.367
for a week!

05:00.367 --> 05:01.900
[gasps]

05:01.900 --> 05:05.567
All right, Scudworth.
You've got yourself a deal.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.633
By the way, how is Brian?

05:10.667 --> 05:12.800
Delicious!

05:12.800 --> 05:14.867
[intense music]

05:14.867 --> 05:16.167
Knock, knock.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.633
(all)
Who's there?

05:17.633 --> 05:18.633
GESH.

05:18.633 --> 05:20.067
(all)
GESH who?

05:20.067 --> 05:22.833
GESH who's going
to beat Clone High!

05:22.833 --> 05:24.367
(all)
GESH! GESH! GESH!

05:24.367 --> 05:26.267
Ha! Ha! Ha!

05:26.267 --> 05:30.067
(Colonel Principal)
And let's hear it for our
minister of comedy,

05:30.067 --> 05:32.600
Detlef Schrempf.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.467
And, finally,
a man who needs no introduction,

05:36.467 --> 05:40.200
our mascot, Geshie!

05:40.200 --> 05:42.900
[warbling]

05:42.900 --> 05:45.900
[all warbling]

05:47.100 --> 05:49.833
GESH seems invincibly
prank-proof,

05:49.833 --> 05:52.300
even that spirit guy.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.400
That's it, Ghengis!

05:53.400 --> 05:55.067
The spirit guy!

05:55.067 --> 05:57.833
We'll steal his mascot costume
and do something to it.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.433
But what?

06:02.067 --> 06:03.833
We'll poop in it!

06:05.067 --> 06:06.500
(Abe)
Hey, Cleo.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.700
I'm dedicating
this next shot to you.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.100
[glass shatters]

06:11.100 --> 06:12.800
[cat meows]
[car horn honks]

06:12.800 --> 06:14.367
[train whistle blows]

06:14.367 --> 06:15.933
[glass shatters]

06:15.933 --> 06:16.933
[phone rings]

06:16.933 --> 06:18.167
[bells clang]

06:18.167 --> 06:19.667
[porpoise chirps]

06:19.667 --> 06:20.667
Dinger.

06:22.233 --> 06:26.767
[dramatic music]

06:26.767 --> 06:28.067
[grunts]

06:29.267 --> 06:30.700
Who are you?

06:30.700 --> 06:35.200
My name is John Dark.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.633
As in Joan D'Arc,
the French name for Joan of Arc?

06:37.633 --> 06:38.700
No.

06:38.700 --> 06:43.067
Nothing like that at all.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.100
[intense rock music]

06:46.267 --> 06:47.200
[phone rings]

06:49.700 --> 06:51.367
[whistle blowing]
- [grunting]

06:51.367 --> 06:53.600
As your new coach,

06:53.600 --> 06:56.533
our goal is simple:

06:56.533 --> 06:59.867
to score a point.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.767
To assure said point,

07:01.767 --> 07:04.433
we've acquired the Harlem
Globetrotters' playbook

07:04.433 --> 07:07.067
off the interweb.

07:07.067 --> 07:10.833
So, John, how come
I've never seen you before?

07:10.833 --> 07:12.067
Yeah.

07:12.067 --> 07:15.700
And who was
the original John Dark, hmm?

07:15.700 --> 07:19.867
Uh, he was this explorer.

07:19.867 --> 07:24.433
Yeah, an explorer, and, uh...

07:24.433 --> 07:27.767
And then he saw
the Statue of Liberty

07:27.767 --> 07:31.333
and realized
he'd been on Earth all along.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.767
Wow, what a turn-on.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.833
I can't believe
we haven't studied that yet.

07:35.833 --> 07:39.600
My Kennedy sense
is detecting some fresh tail.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.067
Hey, er, uh, missie.

07:42.067 --> 07:45.533
How about you and me
play a little one-on-one?

07:45.533 --> 07:46.800
[laughs]

07:46.800 --> 07:48.067
Ahh!

07:48.067 --> 07:51.333
I'll, uh, be, uh,
leaving awkwardly now.

07:53.867 --> 07:54.867
[horn honks]

07:54.867 --> 07:55.967
[tires screech]

07:55.967 --> 07:57.500
Uh, hey, pal,

07:57.500 --> 07:59.867
you wanna buy some speakers?

08:01.367 --> 08:02.900
See, we got
an extra shipment in,

08:02.900 --> 08:03.967
and and if I could just--

08:03.967 --> 08:04.967
- [grunts]
- [squeaks]

08:04.967 --> 08:06.767
Drive, Ghengis, drive!

08:06.767 --> 08:09.100
[tires squeal]

08:09.100 --> 08:11.500
Okay, homes,
lose the costume.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.767
[frightened mumbling]

08:12.767 --> 08:14.667
I said take it off,
you foreigner!

08:14.667 --> 08:16.233
[frightened mumbling]

08:16.233 --> 08:18.800
Well, I guess we're going
to have to take it off by force.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.267
Ghengis, get back here.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.633
- [grunting]
- [hysterical screaming]

08:22.633 --> 08:24.333
This thing won't budge.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.767
All right, here,
let me try the zipper.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.167
[zipping]

08:27.167 --> 08:29.067
Oh, my god!
This isn't a kid in a costume!

08:29.067 --> 08:30.433
It's a living thing!

08:30.433 --> 08:32.667
[both screaming]

08:32.667 --> 08:36.067
Oh, my god! He was genetically
engineered with a zipper!

08:36.067 --> 08:38.067
[both screaming]

08:38.067 --> 08:41.533
Oh, my god!
Who's driving the van?

08:41.533 --> 08:43.067
[both screaming]

08:46.300 --> 08:48.900
Man, this locker room
full of naked boys

08:48.900 --> 08:51.767
is a lot like every other
locker room I've ever been in.

08:51.767 --> 08:54.100
That's for sure.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.700
[laughs, snorts]

08:55.700 --> 08:57.133
[gasps]

09:00.400 --> 09:03.733
So, Abe,
nice playing out there.

09:03.733 --> 09:07.667
Nice? Well, thanks to all your
hot-dogging and point-scoring,

09:07.667 --> 09:09.300
Cleo hardly noticed me.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.133
Forget Cleo.
She's a skanky ho.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.567
Why, you'd be better off
with someone like

09:15.567 --> 09:17.200
Joan of Arc.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.667
Are you serious, John Dark?

09:19.667 --> 09:21.100
Joan of Arc?

09:21.100 --> 09:26.133
Sure, that Joan of Arc
is one tasty piece of bitch.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.867
Well, she's smart,
loyal, pretty,

09:28.867 --> 09:30.567
and I delight
in her caustic wit,

09:30.567 --> 09:32.133
but...

09:32.133 --> 09:33.400
But nothing.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.833
You should date the crap
out of her.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.400
Wow, me and Joan.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.500
Somehow that doesn't sound
so crazy--

09:40.500 --> 09:43.333
hey, I know what you're doing.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.067
I see right through
that mustache, John.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.600
Or should I say

09:48.600 --> 09:51.067
the guy who's trying
to get me interested in Joan

09:51.067 --> 09:53.067
so he can have
Cleo for himself?

09:53.067 --> 09:54.067
No!

09:54.067 --> 09:56.067
I don't want Cleo.
I want you!

09:56.067 --> 09:57.733
To date Joan.

09:57.733 --> 10:00.533
Well, nice try, John Dark,
but forget it.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.100
Cleo's my girl.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.900
Hey, that's no way
to treat a member of the team,

10:04.900 --> 10:08.867
especially one whose skin
is so silky smooth.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.000
And by that, I mean someone

10:10.000 --> 10:12.100
who's as smooth on the court

10:12.100 --> 10:14.800
as, uh, his skin is silky.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.800
I mean, thighs are milky!

10:16.800 --> 10:18.067
I have to go!

10:19.467 --> 10:22.000
Er, eh, gay foster dads?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.300
Do you mind if I watch
Will and Grace with you guys?

10:25.300 --> 10:27.033
But you usually watch
Sportscenter

10:27.033 --> 10:28.467
up in your room, baby.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.800
Well, I've been thinking
about switching channels.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.833
But I'm a little scared.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.867
Well, gettin' into a new show
can be a little uncomfortable.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.533
But once you get to know
the rhythm of it,

10:40.533 --> 10:42.267
you'll be on your knees
beggin' for more.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.733
You two girls keep it down.
It's back on.

10:45.733 --> 10:47.733
(man on television)
Has anyone seen my zucchini?

10:47.733 --> 10:49.867
I'm looking at you,
Will and Grace.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.833
[laughs]

10:54.333 --> 10:57.367
(Cleo)
So John Dark-and-handsome.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.567
When are you picking me up
for the homecoming prom?

10:59.567 --> 11:01.967
Uh, didn't Abe ask you?

11:01.967 --> 11:04.633
Sure, but he's not half
the athlete you are.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.233
Or man.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.767
[gobbling]

11:09.867 --> 11:12.067
Mmm, milk.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.900
Thanks, but I'm just
not attracted to you

11:16.900 --> 11:18.400
in that way.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.767
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.900
I'm rejecting you.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.400
Rejecting me?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.767
[laughs]

11:25.767 --> 11:29.200
There's something fishy
about that John Dark.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
[squeaking]

11:31.200 --> 11:33.900
What the hell
am I going to do with you?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.667
You want some candy?

11:35.667 --> 11:38.200
Candy! Candy!

11:41.367 --> 11:43.367
- [kissing]
- [laughs]

11:43.367 --> 11:45.600
Hey, you're not so bad
after all.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.500
Geshie, friend!

11:47.500 --> 11:49.067
- [giggles]
- [laughs]

11:49.067 --> 11:51.133
Yeah!

11:51.133 --> 11:54.133
[playful upbeat music]

11:54.133 --> 11:59.200
*

11:59.200 --> 12:01.833
[bicycle bell ringing]

12:01.833 --> 12:05.067
*

12:05.067 --> 12:07.133
[grunting]

12:08.900 --> 12:12.300
[excessive grunting]

12:14.633 --> 12:17.767
To distract us from
the homoerotic nature

12:17.767 --> 12:19.733
of this men's-only weight room,

12:19.733 --> 12:23.800
it is now time for the sexual
conquest discussion to begin.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.333
John Dark, please, uh,
start us off.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.867
I would never kiss and tell.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.533
Intruder! Intruder!

12:30.533 --> 12:33.300
Kidding!
I'm kidding, of course.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.633
Let's see.

12:34.633 --> 12:38.300
Once I met this, um, girl.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.633
(all)
Yeah? Yeah?

12:39.633 --> 12:42.267
And we kissed.

12:42.267 --> 12:43.833
(all)
Yeah? Yeah?

12:43.833 --> 12:47.100
And then we held each other
until the sun came up.

12:48.833 --> 12:49.867
And then I nailed her.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.467
- Jackpot!
- Yeah!

12:51.467 --> 12:54.367
Was that girl
someone else's girlfriend, Dark?

12:54.367 --> 12:56.433
Because you seem to be
into that.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.067
(all)
Ooh!

12:58.067 --> 13:00.633
You certainly don't have
the moral fiber it takes

13:00.633 --> 13:02.967
to be captain, like me.

13:02.967 --> 13:06.767
Lincoln! You're out as captain,
and John Dark's in.

13:06.767 --> 13:10.500
I shall now remove
your embroidered C.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.567
[tearing]

13:12.600 --> 13:14.500
Why the long face?

13:14.500 --> 13:16.700
Genetics?

13:16.700 --> 13:19.167
[hearty laugh]

13:20.400 --> 13:23.367
I never wanted you
to get hurt, Abe.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.600
It's a little late for that.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.100
You may have
my captain's C,

13:28.100 --> 13:30.433
but you'll never get
my other C.

13:30.433 --> 13:31.633
Cleo!

13:31.633 --> 13:34.367
Your Cleo asked me
to the dance!

13:34.367 --> 13:36.367
You lie, Dark!

13:37.567 --> 13:39.767
[screaming]

13:39.767 --> 13:42.867
I'm not talking to you anymore.

13:42.867 --> 13:44.967
There's no one
I can trust!

13:44.967 --> 13:47.267
Even Joan hasn't
been around recently,

13:47.267 --> 13:49.700
for some
unsuspicious reason.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.600
Damn it, I'm the tallest!

13:51.600 --> 13:53.133
[sighs]
Perfect.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.067
Hey, uh, new captain.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.067
Just wanted to say that you
should pass me the ball more.

13:58.067 --> 14:01.433
Because I'm always open.

14:01.433 --> 14:03.600
[whispers loudly]
For anything.

14:09.967 --> 14:11.067
[splashing]

14:12.467 --> 14:15.467
Penny for your thoughts.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.400
Oh, Mr. Butlertron,

14:17.400 --> 14:20.567
I wanted--
I mean, my friend wanted

14:20.567 --> 14:23.400
to show that girls
can do anything boys can,

14:23.400 --> 14:24.733
but in the process,

14:24.733 --> 14:28.200
she ended up hurting
the one boy she loves most.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.933
"Your friend"
should listen to her heart.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.700
I'm not programmed to wink,

14:32.700 --> 14:34.133
but if I were programmed
to wink,

14:34.133 --> 14:37.367
I would have winked
when I said, "Your friend."

14:37.367 --> 14:40.400
Oh, Mr. B,
I just don't want to hurt Abe.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.200
What would the real
Joan of Arc have done?

14:43.200 --> 14:45.067
She would have
listened to her heart.

14:45.067 --> 14:47.500
And then she would have
gotten burned at the stake,

14:47.500 --> 14:49.567
but, you know, what are the odds
of that gonna happen again?

14:49.567 --> 14:50.567
[laughs nervously]

14:50.567 --> 14:53.300
38%.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.300
Geshie, there was a time

14:56.300 --> 14:59.500
when I wanted to rip
your head off and poop into you.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.800
Geshie love Ghandi.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.767
And Ghandi love Geshie.

15:03.767 --> 15:05.700
That's why
I have to set you free.

15:06.667 --> 15:07.800
[mumbles sadly]

15:10.067 --> 15:13.100
[excited warbling]

15:15.600 --> 15:16.933
Candy!

15:16.933 --> 15:17.900
[squirrel squeaking]

15:21.600 --> 15:23.167
Candy!

15:23.167 --> 15:24.333
[birds chirping]

15:25.767 --> 15:28.233
[giggles]
Candy!

15:28.233 --> 15:30.600
[excited warbling]

15:30.600 --> 15:31.867
- [porpoise chirping]
- [chomping]

15:31.867 --> 15:33.100
[saw shearing]

15:34.367 --> 15:36.667
[whistles]

15:36.667 --> 15:40.167
Well, we're now exactly
one minute into the contest,

15:40.167 --> 15:41.600
and it's starting
to look like GESH

15:41.600 --> 15:43.333
may have
the advantage tonight.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.833
And new captain
John "Dancing in the" Dark

15:45.833 --> 15:47.333
hasn't taken a shot yet.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.067
He keeps passing
to that gangly buffoon,

15:50.067 --> 15:51.100
Abe Lincoln.

15:52.433 --> 15:53.800
[glass shatters]

15:53.800 --> 15:57.533
Now, these are just
my bustles and kerchiefs.

15:57.533 --> 16:01.900
The rest of my delicates are
festering in my PT Cruiser.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.067
(Ghandi)
With Geshie gone,
my heart's just not in it.

16:06.067 --> 16:07.567
I sure hope he's okay.

16:11.467 --> 16:13.200
What a shellacking!

16:13.200 --> 16:15.367
Taft, Napoleon,
here's the stilts

16:15.367 --> 16:16.967
and the obscenely long
trench coat.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.533
You know what to do.

16:18.533 --> 16:20.633
Looks like a new player's
checking in to the game.

16:20.633 --> 16:23.700
(Dan Patrick)
I don't think that's a
regulation trench coat, Chris.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.267
And I've never seen
an 8'6" player

16:26.267 --> 16:28.900
with such tiny,
wooden feet.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.500
[grunting]

16:30.500 --> 16:32.800
Pass it to
the tall kid!

16:34.767 --> 16:36.200
[growling]

16:39.733 --> 16:41.300
Geshie!

16:41.300 --> 16:42.933
Ghandi!

16:42.933 --> 16:45.933
Geshie!

16:45.933 --> 16:48.567
Ghandi!

16:51.067 --> 16:52.833
- [chomping]
- [whistle blows]

16:52.833 --> 16:54.367
Aww.

16:54.367 --> 16:57.100
(Dan Patrick)
Oh! Technical foul on
GESH for biting.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.367
That's two shots
for Clone High.

16:59.367 --> 17:02.267
Abe, we're all
counting on you...

17:02.267 --> 17:04.367
to give the ball
to Dark!

17:04.367 --> 17:06.833
He's shooting
the free throws!

17:06.833 --> 17:09.667
Oh, did you think that
I meant that you--

17:09.667 --> 17:10.867
no!

17:10.867 --> 17:12.767
Let Abe shoot.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.067
He can make it.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.067
Forget it, John.
I suck.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.067
You should shoot.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.767
Yes, listen to
the sucky kid.

17:18.767 --> 17:22.067
No. I can't do this.

17:22.067 --> 17:24.833
You see, the rules don't allow

17:24.833 --> 17:27.133
girls or animals
to play basketball.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.967
But I wanted to prove
that a girl can play

17:28.967 --> 17:30.800
just as good as any guy.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.067
That's why I donned
this clever disguise.

17:33.067 --> 17:37.167
You see, I'm not John Dark.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.233
I'm Joan of Arc!

17:41.667 --> 17:43.200
[gasping]

17:43.200 --> 17:46.833
Oh, so the, uh, fellow was
a broad from the get-go.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.067
Good bye, Will and Grace.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.167
Hello, Dharma and Greg!

17:51.167 --> 17:54.267
Ugh, I almost
did it with Joan?

17:55.333 --> 17:58.067
Uh, hot.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.900
Joan, how could you
lie to me?

17:59.900 --> 18:01.333
Abe, try to understand. I--

18:01.333 --> 18:04.600
Oh, I understand
you sold us all a bill of goods,

18:04.600 --> 18:06.500
and those goods
turned out to be bad.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.933
Then you sold me
up the river.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.367
That may be,
but I sent you up that river

18:10.367 --> 18:12.233
with my heart as a paddle.

18:12.233 --> 18:15.700
But you took that paddle
and smacked me in the face.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.933
And I wear my heart
on my sleeve,

18:17.933 --> 18:21.433
so when I wiped my face,
I got heart all over it.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.733
Ge--wait, what are
we talking about?

18:23.733 --> 18:24.800
I don't know, Joan!

18:24.800 --> 18:26.567
But I do know this.

18:26.567 --> 18:28.733
You have to shoot
those free throws.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.100
No chance, skeezix.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.333
You know the rules.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.967
Henry the VIII,
you're in.

18:32.967 --> 18:33.967
[porpoise chirping]

18:33.967 --> 18:35.067
[crowd gasps]

18:35.067 --> 18:36.333
Damn it!

18:36.333 --> 18:40.533
Would everyone in a
fake mustache please leave?

18:44.100 --> 18:47.633
Okay, Lincoln,
I trust your sideburns are real.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.433
Do this for me.

18:49.433 --> 18:51.500
Shoot the damn ball!

18:51.500 --> 18:52.600
No!

18:52.600 --> 18:54.633
I admit it;
I laughed at Joan

18:54.633 --> 18:56.367
when she wanted
to be on the team.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.867
To think of it,
a girl playing basketball?

18:58.867 --> 18:59.867
[snickers]

18:59.867 --> 19:05.067
[laughter]

19:05.067 --> 19:07.667
I know.
Pretty weird, huh?

19:07.667 --> 19:11.900
But it turns out Joan
is the best player on the team.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.967
I say let her shoot!

19:14.967 --> 19:19.400
(crowd)
Let her shoot! Let her shoot!
Let her shoot!

19:19.400 --> 19:21.700
Oh, hell, I wrote the rule.
I'll just erase it.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.367
Ball is yours, girlie!

19:24.367 --> 19:25.433
Thanks, Abe.

19:25.433 --> 19:27.800
Score that point,
John Dark.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.067
Score it
like the wind.

19:30.067 --> 19:32.300
[dramatic music]

19:33.500 --> 19:35.367
[cameras popping]

19:35.367 --> 19:42.100

19:42.100 --> 19:43.100
[grunts]

19:43.100 --> 19:45.600

19:45.600 --> 19:47.233
[gasping]

19:47.233 --> 19:52.067
*

19:52.067 --> 19:53.833
[crowd murmurs]

19:53.833 --> 19:57.967
Girl ball!
Girl ball!

19:58.833 --> 20:01.067
[grunts]

20:01.067 --> 20:04.133
[ecstatic cheering]

20:04.133 --> 20:08.733
I wore these bad boys
at Burning Man...

20:08.733 --> 20:11.533
seven years in a row!

20:11.533 --> 20:14.033
Let's hear it
for our hero!

20:14.033 --> 20:15.500
I'm no hero.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.767
I'm just a girl
who loves basketball.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.933
Not you, Abe.

20:20.933 --> 20:25.133
If Abe hadn't made that speech,
you never would have scored.

20:25.133 --> 20:27.333
(crowd)
Abe! Abe! Abe! Abe!

20:27.333 --> 20:30.700
Oh, Abe,
you're my hero.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.033
(crowd)
Abe! Abe! Abe! Abe!

20:33.033 --> 20:34.533
And that concludes
our broadcast

20:34.533 --> 20:36.367
of the Clone High
homecoming game.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.700
Now stay tuned for the
Mills Elementary School

20:38.700 --> 20:40.167
dodge ball championships.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.600
(Geshie)
Candy!

20:44.600 --> 20:48.067
(male announcer)
Next week on a very special
Clone High,

20:48.067 --> 20:50.967
will Abe and Cleo
share their first kiss

20:50.967 --> 20:53.767
besides the one
they had on the first episode?

20:53.767 --> 20:57.200
And will special guest star
Ashley Angel from O-Town

20:57.200 --> 20:58.533
make me scream?

20:58.533 --> 21:01.367
Oh, my God!
I love you, Ashley!

21:01.367 --> 21:04.100
Yes, yes, he will.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.333
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

21:06.333 --> 21:09.333
* Secret government employees

21:09.333 --> 21:12.233
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:12.233 --> 21:15.100
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:15.100 --> 21:18.067
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:18.067 --> 21:20.867
* They're going to make it
if they try *

21:20.867 --> 21:23.733
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:23.733 --> 21:30.100
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

21:30.100 --> 21:33.533
* Clone High
