00:01.650 --> 00:03.129
Previously onSEAL Team...Havoc, this is Bravo 1.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.991
We are at RTB.ERIC: Copy that, 1.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.827
Secure the F50 onto the bearcat
and send him to us.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.303
We're not escorting him?ERIC: That's correct.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.749
You're being re-tasked to assist

00:11.790 --> 00:13.781
with enemy combatants
at the Khorana University.

00:13.830 --> 00:16.390
Bravo 1, there are American
students trapped there.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.315
We're getting reports
of active shooters

00:18.360 --> 00:19.702
targeting students and faculty.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.229
Roger that.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.441
JASON: I've been with the teams
for nearly 20 years.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.229
Been leading Bravo
for half that.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.931
And what I realize now
with Alana gone is that, uh,

00:27.980 --> 00:29.140
I've been able to do that, sir,

00:29.200 --> 00:30.679
because she's had
the home front covered.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.280
Bravo Team is in good hands
with Adam.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.241
He'll be fine without me.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.240
But my son, my daughter,

00:38.290 --> 00:40.554
they're not gonna
be good without me.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.462
Sniper!

00:46.870 --> 00:49.304
I have to leave Bravo Team.

00:51.570 --> 00:53.731
_ The terror attacks
In Mumbal continue,

00:53.790 --> 00:55.303
as a Pakistani radical group

00:55.350 --> 00:58.092
has struck multiple targets
across the city.

00:58.140 --> 01:01.189
Though Indian authorities have
retaken control of five sites,

01:01.230 --> 01:04.791
a sixth, Khorana University,
remains in terrorist hands

01:04.840 --> 01:07.843
with students and faculty
being held hostage.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.404
We need to get an angle
on the sniper.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.360
Tan building, southwest corner.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.196
If I get up to that white truck
up there, I'll get a clean shot.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.411
Roger that, Bravo 2.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.109
Take 6. Get this guy.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.123
Clay? Clay!

01:38.480 --> 01:39.617
Man down!

01:58.330 --> 02:01.197
Clay? Clay!

02:14.870 --> 02:17.088
Come on. Come on.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.398
Get him into cover.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.079
ERIC :
Bravo 1, this is Havoc. Sitrep.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.096
Your advancement
to the umversrty

02:24.140 --> 02:25.220
seems to have stopped.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.487
Havoc, this is Bravo 1.

02:26.530 --> 02:28.179
Man down. How copy?

02:28.230 --> 02:30.312
Copy, Bravo 1. Standing by.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.975
He took a round
directly to his chest plate.

02:36.020 --> 02:37.499
No entry or exit wound.
Didn't penetrate.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.098
Got a pulse,
but he's not breathing.

02:39.150 --> 02:40.196
All right, impact
must have paralyzed

02:40.240 --> 02:42.151
his respiratory system.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.198
All right, let's get him up.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.684
Let's get him up.

02:52.730 --> 02:55.517
At least we know his body
armor wasn't made in China.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.209
All right, yes or no
questions only.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.295
Are you in Virginia Beach?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.952
Are you in India?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.217
Am I better

03:06.440 --> 03:08.305
He's fine.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.134
_Goldilocks is
obvrously concussed.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.317
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Give me a sitrep.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.703
The students aren't gonna
be able to hide forever.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.878
We're all up, Havoc. Bravo 2
took a round to body armor.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.625
He's ambulatory.
We are Charlie Mike.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.843
Any new information
on the students' location?

03:23.020 --> 03:25.022
The background
of Valerie Wyatt's video

03:25.070 --> 03:26.844
matches with the third floor
of the library,

03:26.900 --> 03:29.243
but there haven't been
any new posts.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.281
No way to know if the students
are still there.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.979
Maybe they're all too dead
to work the social media.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.509
Maybe they're lying low so they
don't give themselves away.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.778
Dead or alive,
job is to find 'em.

03:39.430 --> 03:40.556
Havoc Base,
this is Bravo 1.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.998
We lost a little
time here.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.257
Can you help
us out with

03:43.310 --> 03:44.561
a faster_ route to
the umversnty?

03:44.610 --> 03:45.656
DAVIS: Bravo 1, resume
your previous course.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.042
50 meters up, turn east.

03:47.090 --> 03:48.398
800 meters on, you're gonna

03:48.440 --> 03:49.998
run into the back gate
of the university.

03:50.050 --> 03:51.654
Roger that. Bravo out.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.782
Clay, stay close to me.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.319
Ray, you're on point.
The rest of you,

03:55.360 --> 03:56.486
fall into patrol order.Check.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.829
How you feeling?

03:59.890 --> 04:02.882
Uh, like the weakest link.
Like I slowed us down.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.886
I'd rather lose a little time
than my ZIC.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.100
Shake it off.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.754
Not so easy.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.289
Not so hard.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.412
Shake it off.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.371
Roger that.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.639
TV REPORTER: On the heels
of Indian troop movements

04:17.690 --> 04:19.294

04:19.340 --> 04:21.900
a Pakistani radical group,
Hizbul Mujahideen,

04:21.950 --> 04:24.293
have launched coordinated
attacks in Mumbai.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.216
We can confirm one American,

04:28.260 --> 04:29.659
State Department official
David Nelson,

04:29.700 --> 04:33.261
was_ rescued_earlier
by Indian security forces.

04:33.310 --> 04:35.358
Indian government officials are
calling the violence cowardly,

04:35.400 --> 04:39.006
reprehensible attacks
on India's sovereign rights,

04:39.060 --> 04:42.052
and promised a thorough vetting
of security procedures

04:42.100 --> 04:44.318
to protect against...

05:17.660 --> 05:19.434
Need some help?

05:19.490 --> 05:21.481
Yeah. Thanks.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.150
[jet engine whooshing
in distance]

05:52.520 --> 05:54.385
Thank you, sir.

05:56.570 --> 05:58.435
My brothers, they're gonna
be out there fighting,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.392
and, um, I'm gonna be home
sleeping in my bed.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.488
How long till you
get used to that?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.397
Well, I'd like
to say weeks,

06:06.450 --> 06:08.668
but I'd be lying.

06:08.710 --> 06:12.271
Months, years.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.403
Helps to know your team will
understand why you left.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.623
It's true what you're
thinking, though.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.580
Everything just goes on, right?

06:20.640 --> 06:23.279
Without you, yes.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.981
Put your foot in a bucket
of water, take it out.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.419
There's no hole,
water fills it in.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.165
SEAL teams are like that.

06:32.210 --> 06:33.643
Doesn't feel good.

06:33.690 --> 06:37.251
If it did, there would be no
value to what we do, right?

06:39.260 --> 06:41.728
Standing down isn't
giving something up.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.304
It's tearing
something out of you.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.351
It can't feel good.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.056
Bravo 1, you have
multiple unknowns

06:52.100 --> 06:53.089
approaching your position.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.532
Roger that. Out.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.934
Dual point. Dual point.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.308

08:03.170 --> 08:05.343

08:05.390 --> 08:07.381
What happened?!Adam, Adam, he, uh...

08:07.440 --> 08:09.340
he just...

08:11.440 --> 08:13.396
Give me a sitrep. Over.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.929
Adam's gone.

08:17.970 --> 08:21.098
Bravo 1, respond.

SONNY:
Clay, answer him.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.026
Radio check. Over.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.890
Will someone please answer him?

08:32.940 --> 08:35.898
Bravo 1, answer.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.508
All stations,
this is Havoc Base.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.723
What the hell
is going on out there?

08:40.780 --> 08:43.419
Havoc, this is Bravo 6.
We read you Lima Charlie.

08:43.470 --> 08:46.598
I pass fallen eagle.

08:48.740 --> 08:50.958
Bravo 6, say again your last.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.083
6 to base, I say again,
fallen eagle.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.358
We lost Bravo 1.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.391
How long till we can
get 'em out of there?

09:00.970 --> 09:02.926
Bravo 6, tell me what you need.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.143
Do you want to extract?

09:05.190 --> 09:07.841
Or do you want to continue
the mission after the CASEVAC?

09:07.890 --> 09:10.324
Havoc, can you relay the latest
sitrep at the university?

09:10.370 --> 09:12.361
The Mumbai police
have set up a perimeter.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.502
There's a Lieutenant Arya
that's in charge there.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.245
They have reported
execution of hostages.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.064
It's 20 minutes to get to them.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.940
Bravo 6,

09:19.990 --> 09:22.026
CASEVAC and extract
are both 20 mikes out.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.422
It's your call.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.721
Roger that.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.338
How far are we from
the umversnty, Havoc?

09:26.390 --> 09:28.164
DAVIS:
About three mikes.

09:28.210 --> 09:30.087
I copy three mikes
to the university

09:30.130 --> 09:31.643
and 20 to CASEVAC or extract.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.736
Stand by.Extract?

09:33.790 --> 09:35.041
No discussion.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.957
We ain't turning tail.
You understand?

09:38.010 --> 09:41.002
This job ain't done.RAY: I don't like a CASEVAC
any more than I like an extract.

09:41.050 --> 09:42.961
Takes us time
that the kids don't have.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.830
Okay, then we hump
the rest of the way in.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.222
We're not leaving Adam here.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.497
Adam's not here.

09:48.540 --> 09:49.882
Then I'm staying here!
You understand?!

09:49.930 --> 09:51.147
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.236
We're not leaving Adam behind!Sonny!

09:52.280 --> 09:53.360
I got it.
Hey.

09:54.980 --> 09:58.507
Clay. You staying here
is not an option, okay?

09:58.550 --> 10:00.984
It's either we
all stay or not.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.110
Now, let me tell
you something.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.639
As hard as_this
deCI5|on IS,

10:03.690 --> 10:05.760
Adam would have made
the same damn one.

10:05.820 --> 10:09.688
Because he knows those kids
need us more than he does.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.779
Hey. We will be back.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.993
Look at me.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.177
We will be back.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.390
Okay.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.178
Havoc, this is Bravo 6.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.925
That's a negative
on the CASEVAC.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.790
We are Charlie Mike
to the university.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.238
What about Bravo 1?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.589
Roger that, 6.
I copy, Charlie Mike.

10:37.630 --> 10:39.279
Hey, what about Adam?

11:01.090 --> 11:02.864
RAY: _
Trent on pomt.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.047
Sonny, take rear security.

11:05.090 --> 11:07.092
Let's move out.

11:22.020 --> 11:25.717
Hey, now ain't
the time to mourn.

11:25.770 --> 11:29.376
Time for payback,
all right? Let's go.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.433
Hello.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.176
[man speaking indistinctly
over phone]

11:48.220 --> 11:50.745
Right, yeah, I understand.
Thank you.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.224
Really, I-I really,
I appreciate it.

11:53.270 --> 11:56.182
Oh, I need to go.
Uh, Emma's here.

11:58.020 --> 11:59.669
Who was that?

11:59.710 --> 12:02.759
Friend offering sympathies.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.199
Why does it
bother you so much?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.231
Why does it bother me?
Because all they do

12:06.290 --> 12:08.804
is they say the same thing;
what else is there to say?

12:08.850 --> 12:11.853
"Deepest sympathies."
Every time I hear that... ring,

12:11.900 --> 12:14.630
it just reminds me of your mom.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.419
Want to do something?
Bring her back.

12:16.470 --> 12:19.644
You know, sometimes what
you need from somebody

12:19.690 --> 12:21.464
is just nothing at all.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.249
Where's your brother?

12:23.300 --> 12:26.349
He wanted garlic knots.
Grandma took him Pungo's.

a real appetite.

police remain on high alert.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.003
That's where they are, right?

12:38.060 --> 12:39.664
Where you'd be now

12:41.280 --> 12:45.182
It's fine. I know you can't say.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.322
When I was little,

12:51.370 --> 12:53.509
when you were gone
and I missed you,

12:53.550 --> 12:55.108
I'd take this picture,

12:55.160 --> 12:57.856
put it in my room.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.504
Yeah?
Yeah.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.381
I used to ask Mom how you got
the cut on your face.

13:02.430 --> 13:05.422
She'd say it was a story
for when I'm older.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.166
I'm older now, so...
how'd you get it?

13:09.220 --> 13:12.439
Let me see that.

13:12.480 --> 13:16.041
I didn't notice anything
but your mother in this picture.

No, my memoirs are gonna be
mostly about my brothers

13:32.240 --> 13:34.196
and all the fun times
I had with them.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.845
Mm.

13:38.290 --> 13:41.202
We bring you now disturbing
video from an American student

13:41.250 --> 13:43.115
caught up in
the terrorist attack.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.637
They came... shooting

13:44.690 --> 13:46.203
and-and stopping
and starting again,

13:46.260 --> 13:49.206
and I don't want...

13:49.260 --> 13:51.865
Mom...

13:53.570 --> 13:56.266
It scares me.

13:56.310 --> 13:58.301
And more than ever
that you would be there.

13:58.350 --> 13:59.829
All right, you know,
I'm not going anywhere.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.700
I'm staying here.
I told you that, I'm not going.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.355
I'm still scared.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.542
What does she want?She's from the State Department.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.636
Reporters are calling
her office trying to

14:26.690 --> 14:29.329
seek confirmation that
US. forces are on the ground.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.334
What outlets?

14:30.390 --> 14:31.948
Fox and AP.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.774
How long can she
avoid answering?

14:33.820 --> 14:35.162
Well, as long as we want,

14:35.220 --> 14:36.699
but they're gonna seek out
other sources.

14:36.740 --> 14:40.039
Well, for now, the line is,
"No comment."
Mm-hmm.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.092
Harrington.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.880
ERIC: It's Blackburn, sir.
We have a situation.

14:54.930 --> 14:57.751
Between the media
and the aid organizations,

14:57.800 --> 14:59.756
word about Adam's
gonna get out soon.

14:59.810 --> 15:02.324
All right, I'll, uh,
I'll make sure

15:02.370 --> 15:04.065
the family hears it
from us first.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.372
Roger that, sir.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.409
Eric.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.461
Anything you need, all right?

15:09.510 --> 15:11.501
Thank you, sir.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.475
Ah.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.395
Stupid...

15:42.150 --> 15:43.492
Hi. You okay?

15:43.550 --> 15:48.158
I'm fine. Are you?

15:53.430 --> 15:56.115
You're angry
that you're not there.

15:56.170 --> 15:59.515
I'm just worried about the boys,
that's all.

16:06.830 --> 16:09.390
Phone keeps ringing.Don't pick it up.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.170
Just ignore it, okay?
I'll be inside in a second.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.429
[men shouting in
foreign language]

16:44.480 --> 16:46.084
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.263
Senior Chief Ray Perry,
U.S. Naw Special Operations.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.561
I'm looking for Lieutenant Arya.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.873
Building's surrounded.
We haven't made entry.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.625
Force 1 instructed me
to relianIsh

17:02.670 --> 17:04.797

17:04.840 --> 17:06.580
How many enemy

17:06.630 --> 17:09.190
At least six,
but we don't know.And hostages?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.151
Also unknown.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.542
The main entrance,

17:12.590 --> 17:15.195
is it a lobby or an atrium?Both.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.059
Then let's not go that way.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.634
This side entrance
over here.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.419
Is it locked?

17:21.470 --> 17:24.689
It's an emergency exit;
it shouldn't be.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.869
Check. We enter there.

17:26.910 --> 17:28.958
Trent, on point.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.867
I got it.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.603
Took a round
to the chest, brother.

17:33.660 --> 17:36.618
Shook it off.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.616
All right. Take us out.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.288
What?

18:06.340 --> 18:09.639
HARRINGTON: Oh, that's a hell
of a greeting, Master Chief.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.510
Sorry, sir, we've, uh,
had some issues here.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.549
How can I help you?

18:12.610 --> 18:14.566
It's Adam.

18:14.610 --> 18:17.738
What about Adam?

18:17.790 --> 18:19.746
We lost him, Jason.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.173
We lost Adam?

18:23.230 --> 18:26.097
Yeah.

18:26.140 --> 18:29.143
He's dead.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.683
Havoc, this is Bravo.
We are making entry.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
It's okay, it's okay.

18:50.340 --> 18:51.511
We're Americans.
We're Americans.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.993
We're here to help.
You're safe now.

18:54.260 --> 18:56.125
Havoc, this is Bravo.
We are standing down.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.169
Is my arm broken?

19:00.220 --> 19:01.562
Gonna say yes.

19:01.610 --> 19:03.214
Embassy doctors will confirm.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.226
Remember _how
you hurt It?

19:05.270 --> 19:06.874
I heard gunshots.

19:06.920 --> 19:10.879
I ran. Everybody did.
Tripped and fell.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.659
How many bad guys did you see?

19:12.710 --> 19:15.440
I don't know.
I was on the floor.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.104
I played dead
until they were gone.

19:17.150 --> 19:20.881
Waited for help and...
nobody came,

19:20.940 --> 19:23.022
so I ran for it.

19:23.070 --> 19:26.244
I left my friends
behind.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.894
Who does that?

19:27.940 --> 19:30.761
It's not like
you had a real choice.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.259
JAMIE: Everyone in
our program was there.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.200
We were there to cram
for an exam tomorrow.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.774
How many of you?

19:38.820 --> 19:40.344
Nine.

19:40.390 --> 19:41.869
And you guys were all together
when the shooting started?

19:41.910 --> 19:43.434
No.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.302
I went to_the bathroom and
they were In the study lounge.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.918
Where's the study lounge?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.744
I'm sorry.
I want to help.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.350
Ijust, I can't
remember right now.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.924
Jamie, Jamie.

Brock.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.009
Up.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.061
Hey, Jamie,
this is Cerberus.

20:05.110 --> 20:07.101
He's just gonna
get your scent.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.114
Havoc, this is Bravo.
Making entry.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.513
ERIC:
Solid copy, Bravo. Havoc out.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.255
Trent, Brock, Ray,
you're with me.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.688
Kairos, you go left.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.868

Clear left.

20:56.470 --> 20:57.767
Shotgun.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.981
Rather not let the bad
guys know we're here.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.200
Pick it.

21:02.730 --> 21:04.903
Havoc, this is Bravo 6,
making entry.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.770
Third floor library.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.828

21:14.750 --> 21:16.559
RAY: All right,
Sonny, organize 'em.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.133
Brock, Kairos,
set security.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.488
Trent, Clay, med checks.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.054
All right, everybody, listen up.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.318
We're US. military,
and we are here to help you.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.056
Do what we say to do,
and when we say to do it,

21:26.110 --> 21:28.101
and all of us are gonna
get out of here breathing.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.539
You understand?

21:30.590 --> 21:32.285
Okay, single file line.
Let's go.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.843
Bravo 6 to Havoc Base.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.458
We have positive control
of eight American students,

21:35.510 --> 21:36.932
five foreign, on target.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.799
ERIC: Copy that, Bravo 6.They're all good to go.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.555
Copy.
ERIC: You have
found the students.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.760
Bravo 6 to Havoc Base.

21:41.820 --> 21:43.037
We're preparing
to extract the students.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.069
Copy that.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.940
Everybody,
take their right hand,

21:46.000 --> 21:50.118
and put it on the shoulder
of the person in front of them.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.134
Havoc, this is Bravo 6.
We are Oscar Mike.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.002
Hold at the bottom
of the stairwell.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.225
Holding.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.449
Movement, movement, movement.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.496
I got tangos between us
and our exit point.

22:17.550 --> 22:19.586
Trent, take the high ground.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.063
Kairos, keep them
in the stairwell.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.109
Hold security.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.599
Way too many places
for them to hide out there.

22:27.650 --> 22:28.719
We need an advantage.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.941
Havoc, this is Bravo 6.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.388
Go for Havoc.

22:33.430 --> 22:35.034
Tell Lieutenant Arya and his men

22:35.090 --> 22:36.648
to get to the building's
junction box

22:36.700 --> 22:38.122
outside our entry point.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.693
Roger that.
What do you need?

22:39.740 --> 22:41.389
Darkness.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.741
EMMA:
What's gomg on?

22:51.190 --> 22:54.978
You only wear that uniform
for two reasons.

22:55.020 --> 22:58.979
An award... or a funeral.

22:59.020 --> 23:01.022
Making a casualty
assistance call.

23:01.070 --> 23:02.059
VVho?

23:09.030 --> 23:11.032
Emma, it's...

23:14.340 --> 23:15.557
It's Adam Seaver.

23:19.740 --> 23:21.731
Hannah's dad?

23:24.090 --> 23:26.046
He's dead?

23:26.100 --> 23:30.002
What... what are you
gonna say to them?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.664
I'm gonna say I'm sorry.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.099
And if I had gone
instead of Adam...Then you'd be dead,

23:34.150 --> 23:36.402
and Mike and I would have lost
both of our parents!

23:36.450 --> 23:39.055
Not true.
We both would have been alive.You don't know that!

23:39.110 --> 23:41.101
You don't know!We both would have been alive.

23:41.150 --> 23:42.458
You don't know that.
You don't.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.502
I do.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.288
I'm coming with you.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.285
Not allowed.Neither is telling me

23:51.340 --> 23:54.161
before you inform
the family.

23:55.470 --> 23:57.552
Dad...

23:57.610 --> 24:00.602
I know how Hannah's
about to feel.

24:04.130 --> 24:05.916
I know.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.489
Stand by, Havoc Base.

24:10.530 --> 24:12.486
[men speaking foreign language
in distance]

24:12.530 --> 24:15.055
In three, two, one.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.011
Now.

24:17.060 --> 24:19.494
[men shouting
in foreign language]

25:02.540 --> 25:04.098
All clear.

25:06.150 --> 25:08.459
Havoc, this is 6.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.058
Tell Lieutenant Arya
to give us light.

25:17.210 --> 25:19.371
That's payback.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.003
Name Yusuf Naqvi
mean anything to you?

25:34.050 --> 25:36.359
Yeah. Senior member
of the Pakistani Parliament.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.573
CIA just tied him
to Hizbul Mujahideen.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.837
And?

25:39.880 --> 25:41.097
And Yusuf Naqvi

25:41.140 --> 25:42.573
is knee-deep
in the funding of this.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.053
He just became
a legitimate target

25:44.100 --> 25:45.180
in the War on Terror.

25:45.230 --> 25:49.189
U.S.-Pakistani relations
are a minefield.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.140
It was pulling teeth
to go after bin Laden.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.883
There's no way
D.C. goes after

25:52.940 --> 25:54.896
a democratically elected
Pakistani official.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.857
Students are all safe.

26:06.910 --> 26:09.037
They should be
on their way here shortly.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.162
Are you okay?

26:11.220 --> 26:13.916
Not really.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.919
You're alive!

27:06.360 --> 27:08.965
Hi.

27:09.010 --> 27:10.352
Havoc Base,
this is Bravo 6.

27:10.410 --> 27:11.923
The students are_ en route
to your pOSItIon

27:11.970 --> 27:13.369
along with local
partner force.

27:13.410 --> 27:15.230
Where's our ride to Bravo 1?

27:15.280 --> 27:17.009
Trying to get
you one, Bravo 6.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.276
Could take a beat.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.286
CLAY: Whoa. What is that
supposed to mean?

27:20.330 --> 27:22.195
RAY:
Hey, Clay.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.764
I got this.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.244
ERIC: Yeah, resources
are stretched thin.

27:26.290 --> 27:28.679
The city's still in chaos.
Working on it.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.550
Roger that.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.771
"Roger that"?

27:33.300 --> 27:34.460
That's handling it?

27:34.520 --> 27:35.942
What about, "How long
is this gonna take?"

27:36.000 --> 27:37.251
You know, how long are
we just gonna leave Adam

27:37.300 --> 27:38.255
laying there, exposed,
waiting for somebody

27:38.300 --> 27:39.699
to come pick up
a souvenir?

27:39.740 --> 27:42.379
Davis is monitoring him on ISR
right now, brother.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.044
That's good enough
for you?

27:44.090 --> 27:46.957
That's not good enough for me.

27:47.010 --> 27:48.398
You guys want to wait
here, wait. That's fine.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.486
Clay.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.830
Go ahead.
I'm gonna go get Adam.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.326
Let's go, boys.

29:02.650 --> 29:04.038
Okay.

29:05.090 --> 29:07.035
Okay.

29:25.850 --> 29:28.808
He went there
to help people.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.010
I know.

29:30.070 --> 29:33.585
They were killing kids
in the street just...

29:33.640 --> 29:36.108
Men with guns, just shooting
anything that moved.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.856
Because why?

29:38.900 --> 29:40.549
It was Mumbai.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.591
Right?

29:45.260 --> 29:48.388
It was Mumbai, right?

29:51.960 --> 29:55.259
You know I can't say anything,
not now, Victoria.

29:58.010 --> 30:00.001
I can't say anything.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.229
Do I want media coverage?

30:12.240 --> 30:15.027
Do I want the country
to know what happened?

30:17.250 --> 30:20.936
I am asking you, Jason.
Do I?

30:22.600 --> 30:23.851
It's up to you.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.458
Is it?

30:28.040 --> 30:30.861
How am I supposed to make
a decision like this

30:30.910 --> 30:33.083
if I don't even know
what happened?

30:35.830 --> 30:38.003
Oh, God, this is hell.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.096
This is gonna be hell.

30:47.450 --> 30:51.011
Why don't I have a
husband anymore, Jason?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.712
Why doesn't Hannah
have a father?

30:58.980 --> 31:01.540
The short answer:
he was killed in action.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.672
The long answer is

31:05.730 --> 31:11.032
he gave his life, the ultimate sacrifice to save his brothers.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.083
He died a hero.

31:19.390 --> 31:21.472
He saved lives.

31:21.530 --> 31:23.953
He saved many,
many lives today.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.354
Adam was dedicated to a life.

31:29.400 --> 31:34.235
He was dedicated to something
that was bigger than himself.

31:34.280 --> 31:37.010
Much bigger.

31:37.060 --> 31:41.190
It's why he stepped in for me
when my family needed me.

31:41.240 --> 31:46.018
Which is why your family's
paying the price now.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.413
You're paying the
ultimate price.

31:48.470 --> 31:52.679
If I was there, Adam would
still be here, and I'm sorry.

31:52.730 --> 31:57.349
I am truly sorry for your loss,

31:57.390 --> 32:00.382
and it is your loss.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.566
Should the country know?

32:05.610 --> 32:07.566
Yeah.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.963
The world should know.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.137
The world.

32:12.190 --> 32:15.011
Because if they know,
then he lives on forever.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.751
Okay.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.970
Okay.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.634
ERIC:
I want to commend you all.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.411
Losing Adam and going on
saved lives.

32:33.470 --> 32:37.816
We're wheels up in four hours.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.216
Hit the showers,
anything else that needs doing.

32:45.740 --> 32:48.698
Thank you.

32:48.740 --> 32:52.130
For being the absolute best.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.171
Even on the worst day.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.967
MANDY: Hizbul Mujahideen
was responsible for this.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.443
One SEAL dead, another shot,

33:02.500 --> 33:04.320
countless Indian citizens
murdered,

33:04.370 --> 33:07.066
with the financial support
of a Pakistani MP

33:07.110 --> 33:10.193
by the name of Yusuf Naqvi.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.288
What is this?

33:12.330 --> 33:14.059
Proof of everything I just said.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.111
You're giving
this to me?

33:16.160 --> 33:19.118
No. I have no idea
where you got it.

33:19.170 --> 33:21.115
The US. can't be involved.

33:21.170 --> 33:24.162
You want us to avenge
your friend's death.

33:24.210 --> 33:28.476
I want a terrorist
off this earth.

33:33.140 --> 33:36.041
RAY: For I do not bear
the sword in vain,

33:36.100 --> 33:38.261
for my God has commanded me

33:38.320 --> 33:42.575
to be strong

33:42.620 --> 33:44.622
and courageous.

33:53.940 --> 33:59.116
Do not be afraid,
nor discouraged.

33:59.160 --> 34:03.244
For the Lord your God will be
with you wherever you go.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.316
You've been staring at me
ever since we left.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.749
I don't know.
What, did I say something wrong?

34:26.800 --> 34:28.404
No.

34:28.450 --> 34:30.975
It's just, I get it.

34:36.900 --> 34:40.245
You get it? Okay.

34:40.290 --> 34:42.076
What do you get?

34:42.120 --> 34:44.850
Your job.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.460
I used to think
you couldn't give it up

34:47.520 --> 34:50.739
because it was all about you.

34:50.780 --> 34:54.432
Like you needed to be
some kind of superhero.

34:54.480 --> 34:57.472
But it's not about you, is it?

34:57.530 --> 35:00.693
It's about
everyone else.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.560
You do it to help other people.

35:03.620 --> 35:06.874
I do it to serve, Emma.
I do it to serve.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.967
I'm sorry
Mom never understood that.

35:12.020 --> 35:16.366
Well... your
mom understood.

35:16.410 --> 35:19.675
She understood
In her own way.

35:21.460 --> 35:24.850
You can't give it up, Dad.

35:27.770 --> 35:29.909
I know you did.

35:29.950 --> 35:33.681
Why else would you have
brought all that stuff home?

35:35.690 --> 35:38.341
I have to do what's best
for my family.

35:38.390 --> 35:41.826
Bravo's your family, too.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.879
Decision's been
made, Emma.

35:46.920 --> 35:49.878
And the fact that you made it
is all I ever needed.

35:50.970 --> 35:53.530
To know you'd leave,
for us.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.013
And you did.

35:55.060 --> 35:56.448
We're not talking about this.

35:56.500 --> 36:00.061
We are. I am.

36:00.110 --> 36:03.238
I can be killed.

36:03.290 --> 36:05.190
I go back, I can be killed.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.457
Then what
What happens to Mikey?

36:07.510 --> 36:08.898
Dad,

36:08.940 --> 36:10.760
it's better for me and Mikey

36:10.820 --> 36:13.778
to have all of you
part of the time

36:13.820 --> 36:16.812
than part of you
all of the time.

36:18.820 --> 36:22.085
You leave the team,
you'll rot.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.690
You'll just... fade away,

36:24.740 --> 36:27.265
and we'll have to sit here
and watch it happen.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.789
You'll never be you again.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.485
And I love you the way you are.

36:38.930 --> 36:42.889
I love you, too.
I love you, too.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.547
Can I help you find something?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.374
A priest.

36:55.430 --> 36:56.943
Why is that?

36:56.990 --> 37:01.120
Well, we're losing people
left and right.

37:01.170 --> 37:03.126
It's a curse.

37:03.170 --> 37:05.252
No other way
about it.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.777
No such thing as a curse.

37:06.830 --> 37:09.822
Says the curse himself.

37:09.870 --> 37:12.919
You know, since you've been
here, Jason's gone home,

37:12.960 --> 37:17.260
Clay's been shot,
and Adam's in a-a box.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.663
Would you feel better
if you took a swing at me?

37:19.710 --> 37:20.881
No, hippie.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.886
I'm a peacekeeper.

37:22.930 --> 37:25.012
Got my own way of coping.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.850
Thanks for
steppIng up, man.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.812
Never easy to push through
when a friend goes down.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.988
You recovered.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.860
Too little, too late.

37:47.910 --> 37:50.083
You stepped up when
I was almost willing

37:50.130 --> 37:52.348
to take no for an answer.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.960
You're the reason_Adam's
comIng home WIth us.

37:55.010 --> 37:56.966
I'm the reason he's in a box.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.798
We were close to that S-vest
because I slowed us down.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.924
This isn't about you, Clay.

38:05.970 --> 38:09.883
You want to order
the chaos. You can't.

38:09.930 --> 38:14.708
Here's the truth:
it was Adam's time.

38:17.380 --> 38:19.598
We all have a time.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.073
You know the thing
that really gets me

38:25.120 --> 38:27.907
is that he ripped me
a new one

38:27.950 --> 38:30.339
for diving on a grenade
in a Green Team drill.

38:30.390 --> 38:32.858
Now he goes and he does
a thing like this.
Don't.

38:32.910 --> 38:36.129
Don't you dare.

38:36.180 --> 38:39.741
You know, long before he was
your Green Team instructor,

38:39.790 --> 38:41.963
Adam drafted me to Bravo.

38:42.010 --> 38:45.969
He was my first
teammate at DEVGRU.

38:46.010 --> 38:48.968
And he died saving our lives,
so if you give a damn

38:49.020 --> 38:52.888
about honoring his memory,
don't second-guess him.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.979
Or yourself.

38:56.020 --> 38:58.022
Just remember
what he taught.

39:00.160 --> 39:04.540
SONNY: My nation expects me
to be physically harder

39:04.600 --> 39:07.034
and mentally stronger
than my enemies.

39:12.780 --> 39:16.898
IfI get knocked down,
I will get back up,

39:16.960 --> 39:18.951
every time.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.389
I will draw on every
remaining ounce of strength

39:21.440 --> 39:26.048
to protect my teammates and
to accomplish our mission.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.318
I'm never out of the fight.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.277
We demand discipline.Discipline.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.106
BOTH: _
We expect InnovatIon.

39:34.150 --> 39:35.583
The lives of my teammates

39:35.630 --> 39:38.679
and the success of our mission
depends on me.

39:38.720 --> 39:41.029
BRAVO TEAM:
Our training is never complete.

39:41.070 --> 39:43.846
We train for war,
we fight to win.

39:43.900 --> 39:48.109
I stand ready to bring the full
spectrum of combat power to bear

39:48.160 --> 39:50.208
in order to achieve my mission

39:50.250 --> 39:53.162
and the goals established
by my country.

39:56.170 --> 39:59.469
["Brothers in Arms"
by Dire Straits playing]

39:59.520 --> 40:02.080
The execution of my duties

40:02.130 --> 40:04.655
will be swift and violent
when reqUIred,

40:04.700 --> 40:09.706
yet guided by the principles
I serve to defend.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.878
Brave men have fought and died
building the proud tradition

40:12.930 --> 40:16.923
and feared reputation
I am bound to uphold.

40:25.850 --> 40:28.318
BRAVO TEAM and JASON:
In the worst of conditions,

40:28.380 --> 40:30.940
the legacy of my teammates
steadies my resolve

40:30.990 --> 40:33.982
and silently guides
my every deed.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.902
JASON:
I will not fail.

40:43.740 --> 40:46.732
Baptisms of fire

40:49.490 --> 40:53.836
I've witnessed
your sufferIng

40:56.060 --> 40:59.097
As the battle raged higher

41:01.720 --> 41:04.803
And though they did hurt me

41:04.850 --> 41:08.024
So bad

41:08.070 --> 41:12.188
In the fear and alarm

41:14.210 --> 41:17.168
You did not desert me

41:17.210 --> 41:20.771
My brothers in arms.
