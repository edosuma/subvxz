03:00.046 --> 03:02.788
This morning it felt like someone
took a shovel to the back of my head.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.951
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Great party.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.724
- I'm glad you had fun.
- Did I leave my jacket?

03:07.887 --> 03:09.628
- I didn't see one.
- It was 30 degrees.

03:09.789 --> 03:11.928
- You went home without your jacket?
- I was lit.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.503
Well, I think you were
scared of shirtless Gabe.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.298
Hey.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.116
Ms. Robinson.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.153
Heard you threw a party last night.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.817
It was just a small thing. I don't--
I don't think you would've enjoyed it.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.521
Judging by the damage to some
of my employees, I agree.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.424
All right, not a trick question.
Tell me what was playing on the hi-fi.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.037
Rascals, Stones, Creedence.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.763
- No jazz.
- Ugh.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.805
How do you party to jazz?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.972
Sometimes you break my heart.

04:06.846 --> 04:07.847
Good morning.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.760
Hi.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.690
How are you feeling this morning?

04:12.352 --> 04:14.628
I'm feeling pretty darn wonderful.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.628
- Because I just came in with Ned.
- Oh, yeah, we--

04:18.024 --> 04:20.163
We decided to walk in separately.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.364
Oh, that game.
Yeah, I know that game.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.009
Patti, I woke up this morning...

04:26.165 --> 04:28.008
...and Ned was still asleep...

04:28.167 --> 04:31.512
...but his arm was wrapped around me.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.679
I just felt so protected.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.186
And-- And so happy.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.546
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:40.713 --> 04:44.820
This is my story, Patti.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.998
Like, Lenny was just...

04:47.153 --> 04:50.600
...someone that I knew
on my way to Ned.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.702
I mean, I-- You know,
I still have to talk to Lenny...

04:54.861 --> 04:58.536
...and pick up my clothes
and everything, but I will do that, I will.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.740
And thank God I left this sweater here.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.577
Good morning.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.188
Morning back at you.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.325
I got in an hour ago,
and saw your notes...

05:14.480 --> 05:17.654
...so this is everything
that I could pull on Dan Kucera.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.355
- He paints on LSD. Did you know that?
- No, but after this last hour...

05:21.521 --> 05:23.228
...I've become very familiar.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.028
What's the verdict?

05:25.191 --> 05:28.172
Personally, I think his work
is undisciplined...

05:28.328 --> 05:31.104
...but I can see that's why
some people appreciate it.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.470
Keep talking.

05:32.632 --> 05:37.206
Well, he won't play by the rules,
but that won't endure.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.441
Rebellion for rebellion's sake,
to me, is a gimmick.

05:40.773 --> 05:44.186
Oh, no. No, no, no.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.051
I don't wanna read any art critics.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.055
- You don't want context?
- No.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.921
Art is personal, it's emotional.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.790
I don't need some ass
telling me what to feel.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.692
I'll feel it when I see the paintings.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.834
I see a review as a different angle
on something.

05:56.989 --> 05:58.468
And there's value in that.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.066
Yes, there is.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.774
Yes, there is.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.944
Seems like you often bring
a different angle, Jane.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.274
I think we should call it "The Jangle."

06:13.473 --> 06:14.611
Groovy.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.465
Hey.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.542
You look chipper.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.237
I am.

06:45.805 --> 06:49.252
You know, I don't get the big deal
with marijuana. I didn't feel anything.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.055
Where's Sam?

06:53.212 --> 06:55.783
In Albany with Gabe.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.120
What are you doing with Gregory?

06:58.317 --> 07:00.058
He's writing a story on an artist...

07:00.219 --> 07:02.495
...who paints well on LSD,
and I'm helping him.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.464
Oh, I have an idea.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.797
Why don't you dose
and join our lawsuit?

07:06.959 --> 07:09.906
- No, thank you.
- Why not, Jane?

07:10.062 --> 07:13.043
Because I think your filing,
or whatever it is, is rude...

07:13.199 --> 07:14.610
...not to mention unnecessary.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.304
Last night you said
you were a career girl.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.383
I am. One who works hard,
plays by the rules...

07:20.540 --> 07:22.747
...and advances on merit.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.391
You cannot advance here.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.291
You can't write.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.692
Are you sure?

07:33.853 --> 07:36.231
Because I think I can.

07:40.226 --> 07:43.400
And I don't bite the hand
that feeds me, Patti.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.574
Patti, it's Doug.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.944
You leave my party early...

07:58.110 --> 08:01.114
...and now you're late
to work, layabout.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.384
I'm not coming in today.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.084
<i>Why?</i>

08:05.485 --> 08:06.930
I got jumped last night.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.531
What? Are you okay?

08:08.688 --> 08:10.099
I'm-- I'm fine. <i>I</i> just--

08:10.256 --> 08:11.826
What happened?
Where were you?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.699
I just-- I got mugged, all right?

08:15.061 --> 08:16.335
So...

08:16.496 --> 08:18.874
...just come to my place.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.241
He was mugged after the party.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.812
Oh, my God, is he okay?

08:23.970 --> 08:27.042
- Who was mugged?
- Doug, after Patti's party.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.412
Are you kidding?

08:38.317 --> 08:41.126
I can't believe
they didn't take any money.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.090
Ow.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.566
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

08:48.427 --> 08:49.770
Thanks.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.073
Of course.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.077
They didn't even take your watch.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.115
Yeah. They didn't take anything.
They couldn't.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.785
I mean, they could,
but they'd be stupid if they did.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.684
- I think they were cops.
- What?

09:06.879 --> 09:08.449
Why would the cops jump you?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.719
Because I wrote a favorable piece
on the Panthers...

09:10.883 --> 09:12.521
...after that detective in Brooklyn
was killed by them.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.858
Okay, if I said something like that...

09:15.021 --> 09:17.627
...you'd say I had an ax to grind
with the police.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.292
You do.

09:20.092 --> 09:23.596
But I-- I think I really pissed off
two of them from the 64th.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.972
When they were kicking my ass, one
said, "Remember whose side you're on."

09:27.700 --> 09:30.146
To play devil's advocate,
a lot of white guys might--

09:30.303 --> 09:32.510
One twisted my arm,
held it behind my back.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.049
It's a rear-wrist lock.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.311
It's only military or police.

09:39.912 --> 09:40.913
Look.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.025
Finn wants me to follow up on graffiti.

09:45.484 --> 09:48.795
I'm sure this is a hardware store
where Novo-22 buys her spray-paints.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.662
- Go see if you can get a name.
- Okay.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.167
- You're gonna stay here and rest?
- No.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.733
I'm going to the police station.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.572
Hi.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.177
Hi.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.887
You know, it's funny,
the last few weeks...

10:11.043 --> 10:15.753
...whenever I've come in here,
it felt like I was doing something naughty.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.393
You know, but now, it just...

10:18.551 --> 10:20.861
-...feels right, you know?
- Uh-huh.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.597
- What is that?
- Well, at the moment, it's crap.

10:26.525 --> 10:30.268
It's supposed to be Finn's "What's Next
for the Space Program" cover.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.103
Oh, you will get it, Ned.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.877
Oh, my God,
did you hear about Doug?

10:38.037 --> 10:40.643
He got mugged last night.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.513
- Is he okay?
- Well, he's at home.

10:43.676 --> 10:46.179
Patti went over to help him.

10:46.712 --> 10:47.782
Wow.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.722
I was supposed to
take his photo today.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.259
We're submitting his Panther article
for a Polk Award.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.724
You know, if you ever got beaten up...

10:56.889 --> 10:59.836
...I would come over to your house
and make sure you were okay.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.472
- Yeah, I hope to never get mugged.
- You can hope...

11:02.628 --> 11:05.199
...but it does happen every day.

11:05.364 --> 11:08.868
And if it did, I would bandage you up...

11:09.035 --> 11:11.641
...and cook your favorite food...

11:11.804 --> 11:13.442
...and--

11:13.606 --> 11:15.813
What is your favorite food?

11:15.975 --> 11:17.648
L-- I don't know.

11:17.810 --> 11:21.155
Come on. You must have
something you like.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.486
I like pork chops.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.287
Pork chops.

11:26.585 --> 11:29.031
I love pork chops.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.775
I'll tell you the same thing I tell
police. I don't know names, addresses.

11:39.932 --> 11:43.141
What do you tell people
who aren't the police, like me?

11:43.402 --> 11:46.611
Usually, even less. Who are you?

11:46.772 --> 11:49.013
I'm Patti Robinson,
I work at News of the Week.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.413
Nobody's gonna get in trouble.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.388
Anybody get free advertising?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.653
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.661
Then I'm sorry, I can't help you.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.699
Do you sell duct tape?

12:16.035 --> 12:18.106
Is this supposed to change my mind?

12:18.270 --> 12:19.943
You buying...

12:20.439 --> 12:22.248
...eighty-nine cents worth of tape?

12:22.408 --> 12:25.412
No. This is meant to fix
the seat in my car...

12:25.578 --> 12:28.115
...where I am gonna live,
because I can't bring home...

12:28.280 --> 12:32.126
...a damn story about a girl
spray-painting buildings.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.322
Either that or driving back...

12:34.487 --> 12:37.229
...to my parent's house
in Bayonne. Thanks.

12:37.389 --> 12:40.529
You expect me to believe you'll
get fired if you don't talk to her?

12:41.527 --> 12:44.633
A few weeks ago, my boss threw
a typewriter through a glass window.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.205
He's a mean son of a bitch.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.737
Not your problem.

12:50.469 --> 12:52.039
Thank you.

12:52.738 --> 12:53.739
Come here.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.380
She comes in every
couple of days around 3.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.025
I think that's when she
gets off work or something.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.388
When's the last time she was here?

13:04.750 --> 13:06.388
Oh, a couple days ago.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.430
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hm.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.340
Oh, Rhodes.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.604
Heard you got mugged.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.975
And that you're
staying home resting.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.616
But you seem all right to me.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.513
- I'm fine.
- Good.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.217
So where you going?

13:31.343 --> 13:34.688
This is an irreversible accusation.
You don't know they were rogue cops.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.827
- It makes sense. if--
- You're pissed off...

13:36.982 --> 13:40.361
...and you're on a fishing expedition,
a dangerous one.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.726
That's why you kept it a secret, right?

13:44.657 --> 13:45.965
Yeah.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.796
How do I help you
when I don't know what you're doing?

13:50.029 --> 13:51.633
- You wanna help?
- Yeah.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.435
I don't know what I can offer,
short of advice.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.581
- But you think I might be right?
- You could be. If you are...

13:58.737 --> 14:00.410
...congratulations.

14:00.573 --> 14:04.214
You join a long list of
illustrious journalists...

14:04.376 --> 14:05.912
...assaulted by the law.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.786
John Zenger,
beaten by the Brits...

14:08.948 --> 14:11.394
...helped start the American Revolution.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.258
Joe McCarthy's goons
roughed up Edward R. Murrow.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.826
That was a big mistake.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.498
You?

14:19.658 --> 14:21.160
I found a dead raccoon
nailed to my door...

14:21.327 --> 14:23.933
...after writing about a murder
in Jupiter, Florida.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.138
Never had the pleasure
of being jumped.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.800
Look.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.941
Here's my advice.
You have a fire in your belly.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.344
That's great. Use it.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.178
But be a professional.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.752
It's a terrible thing
that happened to you.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.618
Don't make this personal.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.632
Find us a story we can print.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.770
That's your job.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.869
Enjoy the whiskey.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.910
Oh, hi, is this Mr. Angelo's?

15:10.075 --> 15:14.182
Um, great, yeah, I'd like to order
some thick-cut pork chops.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.917
Yeah, can you hold two for me?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.619
Great. Yeah, my name is Cindy Rest--

15:19.785 --> 15:22.197
Um, my name is Cindy.

15:22.354 --> 15:23.890
Thank you.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.503
News of the Week,
this is Patti Robinson.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.079
- We have a good boss.
- Finn?

15:37.236 --> 15:39.113
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's great.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.081
He supports me going to
the 64th precinct to chase my hunch.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.242
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

15:43.409 --> 15:46.879
You could miss Novo-22, she might
come into the hardware store later today.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.524
You interview her.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.257
When you're done, write it.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.991
Guessing 600 words, maybe 800,
kind of depends on your take.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.829
- My take? What do you mean my take?
- Because I'm <i>busy.</i>

15:58.991 --> 16:01.835
You're gonna be the reporter,
that's what you want, right?

16:02.161 --> 16:03.538
Yes, yes.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.265
Here's your chance.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.945
I'll tell you the same thing
I was told on my first story.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.281
You'll be fine.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.349
Just don't screw it up.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.061
And it would be Doug's byline...

16:25.217 --> 16:27.629
...but he would know that
I did the whole thing.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.892
God, I mean, if you would be
willing to tell them that...

16:31.056 --> 16:35.061
...when we file the suit,
it could really help us.

16:36.462 --> 16:39.238
Wha--? What's wrong?

16:40.332 --> 16:43.677
What if we go through all of this
to become reporters, and then...

16:43.836 --> 16:45.406
...I'm not any good?

16:45.571 --> 16:47.778
Oh, Patti.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.817
You can do this.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.046
I have heard you
on the phone with people...

16:52.211 --> 16:55.590
...and you get them to open up.

16:55.748 --> 16:59.662
You can't teach the instincts
that you already have.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.759
Planning, ladies?

17:02.488 --> 17:06.459
You really shouldn't do that in the office.
And on company time.

17:07.425 --> 17:11.306
I told her about the lawsuit last night.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.269
I was high. She doesn't approve.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.505
- We really need her on our side.
- Yeah, if she's not with us...

17:17.669 --> 17:21.377
...she, uh-- She might be against us.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.247
I'll talk to her.

17:26.578 --> 17:29.855
Oh, and, Patti, you're gonna be great.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.832
Fill these out.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.071
The next available detective
will take your statement. Have a seat.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.579
I don't wanna talk to a detective,
I wanna talk to the captain.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.214
And I want to meet Elvis. Sit.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.554
I'm a reporter from News of the Week.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.988
Congratulations.
He's a plumber. She's a teacher.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.287
They're all waiting, patiently.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.795
Were any of them assaulted
by New York City cops?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.926
I'll call upstairs to Captain Cancro's girl.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.367
See if I can get you in.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.998
Thank you.

18:27.973 --> 18:29.577
GreQOFY-

18:30.476 --> 18:32.353
- Hello.
- I arranged a private viewing...

18:32.511 --> 18:34.718
...of the new Kucera show later today.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.555
If, as you said, art is personal,
then you should see it alone...

18:38.717 --> 18:41.254
...uninfluenced by public reaction.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.158
You think I'm spineless?

18:43.355 --> 18:44.959
Oh, I think you're a purist.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.764
That's an interesting way to view me.
Not wrong, I might add.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.099
How'd you manage to finagle
a private show? Is it that smile?

18:50.529 --> 18:52.406
Or do you have super powers?

18:52.564 --> 18:54.202
It must be super powers.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.811
I was on the phone.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.038
Shall I arrange a car?

18:57.202 --> 18:59.307
No. Let's walk.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.711
You are coming, right?

19:00.873 --> 19:02.375
I don't like art critics, but, uh...

19:03.075 --> 19:04.520
...I could use the jangle.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.057
Absolutely.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.656
- Jane.
- Cindy.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.956
Um-- Ahem. Patti told me that you know
about our lawsuit.

19:15.287 --> 19:17.790
- I'm not talking about that here.
- Good.

19:18.223 --> 19:21.796
Well, let's go to Cole's, then.
Because we do need to talk about it.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.880
Look, when I first started
at News of the Week...

19:34.039 --> 19:36.315
...I was intimidated by you.

19:36.475 --> 19:40.184
You know, you are
so smart and competent...

19:40.345 --> 19:42.382
...and confident.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.459
And your posture is amazing.

19:44.616 --> 19:45.754
That's very kind of you.

19:45.918 --> 19:49.798
L-- I thought that you could do anything.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.925
But now I know...

19:53.091 --> 19:54.627
...that you can't.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.336
You can't grow.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.533
You can't write.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.575
At least not at News of the Week...

20:01.733 --> 20:05.112
...and-- And that seems
like such a shame.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.841
You know, especially
for somebody like you.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.880
I agree with what you
and the other girls want to do...

20:11.043 --> 20:13.284
...just not how you want to do it.

20:13.445 --> 20:16.153
Have you asked to write?

20:16.315 --> 20:19.023
Have you pitched an idea to anyone?

20:19.184 --> 20:22.654
Well, I sort of talked to Wick about it.

20:22.821 --> 20:25.859
Wick doesn't work here anymore.
Do you know why that is?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.035
Because he's old-school.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.841
So Finn brought in Gregory,
who's from a different world.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.677
So...

20:36.835 --> 20:38.314
...what are you going to do?

20:38.470 --> 20:40.450
I'm going to work hard.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.917
I'm going to prove my value to Gregory,
and then I'm going to ask...

20:44.076 --> 20:46.147
...for an opportunity to advance.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.654
When?

20:49.848 --> 20:51.384
When the time is right.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.564
I think the problem is bigger than that.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.466
Women are...

20:57.923 --> 21:00.802
...marching in the streets...

21:00.959 --> 21:04.668
...asking to be acknowledged.

21:05.163 --> 21:09.737
To get paid for their work,
to be noticed.

21:09.901 --> 21:13.508
- Making demands--
- But you're not making demands...

21:13.672 --> 21:15.845
...you're sneaking around.

21:16.174 --> 21:20.884
You are. You are plotting
against our bosses and our friends.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.985
Men aren't the enemy, Cindy,
you can talk to them.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.490
Maybe even your husband.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.893
Um...

21:33.558 --> 21:37.506
I guess if anyone can break the mold...

21:39.131 --> 21:40.371
...you can, Jane.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.375
I should get my lunch to go.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.391
Sit.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.038
<i>Okay-</i>

22:15.801 --> 22:19.214
Why do you think you were assaulted
by two off-duty cops?

22:19.371 --> 22:22.375
I wrote an article that wasn't flattering
about this precinct.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.414
What was this, uh, article?

22:25.577 --> 22:28.023
There was a shootout
with the Panthers a month ago.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.421
- A detective was killed--
- Detective Kelly.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.218
James Patrick Kelly.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.428
Twenty-three years on the job.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.223
A wife and three daughters.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.730
What proof do you have that these...

22:41.293 --> 22:43.967
...men who assaulted you
were my cops?

22:44.262 --> 22:45.832
They used a cop hold.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.407
What?

22:47.566 --> 22:50.911
I figured if they were your cops,
that you would want to know.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.571
And it-- It makes sense.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.986
How many assaults
were in the city last year?

22:58.143 --> 22:59.816
All five boroughs.

22:59.978 --> 23:03.152
- I think about--
- Almost 5000.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.427
Up 30 percent.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.995
You know what happened
to our budget last year?

23:09.154 --> 23:12.294
Down 18 percent.

23:12.457 --> 23:15.666
This city is so broke,
it can't even afford to pay attention.

23:15.927 --> 23:19.340
And my guys,
they're out there killing themselves.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.909
Literally.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.480
Trying to keep it safe.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.913
Now, the one advantage...

23:26.071 --> 23:30.486
...I have being stuck in this
shit hole 30 years...

23:30.976 --> 23:34.446
...I know all the slander and libel laws.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.017
And you print one word
about being assaulted...

23:38.183 --> 23:42.563
...by one of my cops,
I'll own that rag you work at.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.762
My article was fair.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.302
I've never had a problem
with the police.

23:49.461 --> 23:51.702
Then why aren't you trying to help us?

23:51.863 --> 23:54.673
Last thing we need are journalists
making ourjob harder.

23:54.966 --> 23:57.037
I pinch every penny,
shave every nickel...

23:57.202 --> 24:00.012
...do whatever I can
to keep this city safe.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.846
And I'm gonna keep on doing that.

24:03.842 --> 24:05.822
Any way I can.

24:07.479 --> 24:11.222
And I know
what all my officers are doing.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.096
I think we're done.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.780
I want to report an assault.

24:37.509 --> 24:40.718
Fill these out, you'll see the next
available detective.

25:27.592 --> 25:29.265
Oh, Cindy, you have to see this.

25:29.427 --> 25:30.929
He's like a little Evel Knievel.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.504
He still needs the red,
white and blue jumpsuit.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.645
That would be so cute.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.783
Is, uh--? Is that for
the back of the book?

25:41.940 --> 25:44.921
Um, I guess.
JP asked me to bring it up.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.521
Oh.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.582
<i>Okay-</i>

25:49.748 --> 25:53.093
- Uh, bye, Nedders.
- See you, Cathy.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.137
Ahem. What, um...?

26:03.495 --> 26:04.872
What are you doing?

26:05.030 --> 26:07.135
Looking for an old photo of Doug.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.172
Which I cannot seem to find.

26:39.864 --> 26:43.243
Ninety-nine cents. That is expensive.

26:45.904 --> 26:49.909
The little nozzle always clogs on me.
Does that ever--?

26:54.479 --> 26:56.220
I'm a big fan.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.321
You're like the female Spider-Man.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.596
The-- The 22, is that--?
Is that a lucky number...

27:04.055 --> 27:05.500
...or birthday, or--?

27:08.259 --> 27:11.365
- What do you want?
- I just want a moment of your time.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.437
Oh, I'm not a cop or anything, I'm--

27:13.598 --> 27:16.044
I'm a storyteller, actually.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.407
Like you.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.139
Sort of.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.340
Can I buy you a soda?

27:22.874 --> 27:24.410
I'm hungry-

27:25.010 --> 27:27.650
Can I buy you a soda and a burger?

27:28.780 --> 27:30.316
So...

27:30.815 --> 27:33.352
...how do you get into the train yard?

27:36.454 --> 27:37.899
Ride between the cars.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.736
They never check,
but you gotta hold on with two hands.

27:41.893 --> 27:44.499
So, what you're doing is expensive...

27:44.663 --> 27:46.370
...and dangerous...

27:46.531 --> 27:49.307
...and you could get arrested.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.275
Worse things than being arrested.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.213
Like what?

27:58.610 --> 28:01.318
Who gave you the name Novo-22?

28:01.746 --> 28:02.781
I did.

28:02.947 --> 28:04.722
I like the way it sounds.

28:04.949 --> 28:09.056
Yeah, I like that it's
all that you write, Novo-22.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.967
Is it a message?

28:12.357 --> 28:13.700
Yeah.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.496
To whom?

28:16.661 --> 28:18.231
People.

28:18.897 --> 28:22.504
This will be the part
where I sound really dumb but, um...

28:22.667 --> 28:24.669
...what is the message?

28:25.837 --> 28:27.544
I'm here.

28:28.006 --> 28:29.576
Right on.

28:40.785 --> 28:43.561
Hi, I'm gonna run out,
and get some fresh rosemary...

28:43.722 --> 28:45.998
...because we'll definitely
want that tonight.

28:46.157 --> 28:47.329
Tonight? For what?

28:47.492 --> 28:49.699
For dinner. Heh.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.204
Your pork chops.

28:51.362 --> 28:54.172
I think that I might
actually impress you.

28:54.332 --> 28:57.176
- I'm going to the Knicks game tonight.
- Oh.

28:57.969 --> 29:00.040
Oh, okay, I--

29:00.205 --> 29:03.379
Because I-- I-- I thought that we had...

29:03.541 --> 29:04.849
...talked about dinner.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.657
I didn't know you wanted
to have dinner.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.553
I did.

29:10.815 --> 29:12.294
It's fi-- It's fine.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.657
It's fine. I'll just, uh--

29:14.953 --> 29:16.125
Um...

29:16.654 --> 29:18.361
How do I--?

29:18.523 --> 29:19.729
Um...

29:20.391 --> 29:21.927
You know, I--

29:22.627 --> 29:24.004
How do I get...

29:24.229 --> 29:26.835
...into your apartment?

29:28.133 --> 29:29.373
Uh...

29:29.801 --> 29:31.906
- Cindy, we need to talk.
- You know, it's fine.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.181
I'll just wait till the game is over.

29:34.339 --> 29:37.377
L-- I don't know
what you think about us...

29:37.542 --> 29:39.351
...but you're married.

29:50.321 --> 29:53.063
You took me home last night.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.898
Well, because I was worried about you.

29:56.127 --> 29:59.074
We had sex this morning.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.538
Yeah.

30:02.433 --> 30:04.003
So--

30:04.235 --> 30:07.182
So-- So, what--? What--?

30:07.372 --> 30:08.942
What are we doing?

30:09.107 --> 30:10.211
Having fun.

30:11.509 --> 30:14.718
I don't know. I've never done this
with a married woman.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.525
Is that what I am to you?

30:17.081 --> 30:19.459
I didn't mean it like that.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.466
I told Lenny...

30:25.523 --> 30:27.366
...that I slept with someone else.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.697
When?

30:29.294 --> 30:30.534
Last night.

30:30.695 --> 30:31.867
Does he know who?

30:32.297 --> 30:33.537
No.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.971
I really wish you hadn't done that.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.215
- For your sake.
- My sake.

30:40.371 --> 30:42.408
You two got stuff you gotta work out.

30:42.574 --> 30:46.317
You were pretty cruel to him last night,
and maybe he deserved it.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.621
I don't know, but...

30:53.318 --> 30:54.592
Are you okay?

30:56.487 --> 30:58.626
Am I okay?

30:59.224 --> 31:00.999
Am I--?

31:02.493 --> 31:05.804
Am I--? Am I okay?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.067
Yeah, you've been
hitting the bottle hard.

31:08.233 --> 31:09.735
Mm. Mm.

31:09.934 --> 31:13.404
L-- I am okay.

31:13.571 --> 31:16.177
I am pretty damn great.

31:16.341 --> 31:18.150
We never talked about moving forward.

31:18.309 --> 31:21.347
I mean-- We never talked about
anything long term.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.124
I never thought we had to.
You're marr--

31:24.282 --> 31:27.889
Married, yes, yes, you said that, Ned.

31:29.454 --> 31:32.992
Hey, you're not gonna wanna go out
there with that. Come on.

31:36.661 --> 31:38.937
Oh, shit.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.647
Cindy?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.046
Cindy?

31:53.645 --> 31:55.625
Jane, you ready to go?

31:55.780 --> 31:57.157
On, my way.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.407
Hey, champ. Who gave you this?

32:13.564 --> 32:15.544
I don't know. How'd it go?

32:15.700 --> 32:16.872
Really, really good.

32:17.835 --> 32:18.973
Yeah?

32:19.137 --> 32:22.607
Novo-22 doesn't have a family.
She doesn't have any support system.

32:22.774 --> 32:26.187
So this is her way of telling the world
that she's here, that she exists.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.719
- Does sound promising.
- Mm.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.183
What about you? Did they do it?

32:32.250 --> 32:35.561
Can I report that they did,
and bust them?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.393
No. I don't have any real evidence.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.000
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

32:39.257 --> 32:40.861
It's not over.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.504
I need to get a story.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.835
I went through the system
as an assault victim.

32:46.998 --> 32:50.445
It's like getting assaulted again.
I met teachers, construction workers...

32:50.601 --> 32:53.741
...who missed a whole day's work
for no good reason.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.243
The system's broken.

32:56.407 --> 32:59.115
- I saw firsthand.
- Well, that sounds promising.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.915
- Yeah.
- Like a public service piece.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.720
Look at us.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.892
Look at us.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.568
You go out on a lot of stories?

33:15.727 --> 33:18.731
No, but I'd very much like to.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.275
Better get those gams
in walking shape.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.309
You and I could be
beating some pavement.

33:23.468 --> 33:26.381
<i>- Heh. You bet.
PROTESTORS". Equal rights, equal pay!</i>

33:26.537 --> 33:28.073
- Oh, <i>look at this.
- Equal rights, equal pay!</i>

33:28.239 --> 33:30.480
<i>GREGORY z Oh .
- Equal rights, equal pay!</i>

33:30.641 --> 33:34.612
<i>Equal rights, equal pay!
Equal rights, equal pay!</i>

33:34.779 --> 33:38.727
<i>Equal work, equal Pay!
Equal rights, equal pay!</i>

33:41.419 --> 33:45.595
- Equal rights, equal pay!
- That's an interesting flag.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.397
- I agree.
- But I like that country.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.435
Come on. Excuse us.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.439
- Hello. Yes.
- Excuse us, I'm sorry.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.413
<i>Equal rights, equal pay.
Equal rights, equal--</i>

34:00.838 --> 34:03.614
This is nice, alone.

34:03.775 --> 34:04.879
Thank you.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.750
My pleasure.

34:10.882 --> 34:15.126
Question is, if you didn't know Kucera
was on LSD, would you consider this art?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.993
Well, I do find it more compelling
in person than in the pictures.

34:19.290 --> 34:23.261
Before this, my only exposure to LSD
was Joan Didion writing about it...

34:23.428 --> 34:25.931
<i>...in Slouching Toward Bethlehem.</i>

34:27.065 --> 34:30.012
There's still an ego
on a quarter of a tab...

34:30.168 --> 34:32.842
-...and it wants things.
- You know it.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.984
Of course. I love Joan.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.641
I mean,
in terms of gonzo journalists, she's...

34:37.809 --> 34:40.152
...the pretty high-strung
women's lib version.

34:44.449 --> 34:48.556
You know, there's a big, um, women's
liberation march planned for August.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.757
I heard some of the girls
talking about it in the pit.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.261
Know what I dig
about the women's movement?

34:54.425 --> 34:56.371
The pill and bras on fire.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.337
I'm wondering if maybe
there's a story there.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.843
Yeah?

35:04.001 --> 35:05.844
What's the story?

35:06.871 --> 35:09.647
Well, the women's movement
seems to be growing...

35:09.807 --> 35:11.548
...but...

35:11.843 --> 35:13.083
...will it endure?

35:17.248 --> 35:19.626
Or is it just a gimmick?

35:21.752 --> 35:23.390
That's a good idea. I like it.

35:23.688 --> 35:27.295
If none of the guys want to write it,
I could take a stab.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.735
I mean, I'd have better access
to some of the events than the guys.

35:31.762 --> 35:33.036
And you'd bring the jangle.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.336
Heh, I would.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.439
You want me to talk to Finn?

35:40.838 --> 35:42.681
Please.

35:43.341 --> 35:44.376
You got it.

35:52.550 --> 35:57.465
I might like this more if I were actually
on LSD myself right now.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.534
They're just a mess.

36:00.691 --> 36:03.433
It's funny, I think we've
changed perspectives.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.666
If the point of art is to make you feel...

36:07.031 --> 36:08.977
...I do feel something.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.874
Yeah, by that measure, anything is art.

36:12.036 --> 36:14.710
And we need to hold our artists
to a higher standard.

36:15.873 --> 36:19.013
Jimi Hendrix. He can light
his guitar on fire, and that is art...

36:19.177 --> 36:21.316
...only because he can
play the hell out of it.

36:21.479 --> 36:23.755
Well, now you sound like
a fuddy duddy, Gregory.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.761
I'm just saying that great art,
it needs to stand on its own.

36:28.786 --> 36:32.393
Think about it, when Michelangelo
did his nudes, were they stick figures?

36:32.557 --> 36:35.731
No, no. They were inspired.

36:35.893 --> 36:39.636
And technical, and flawless.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.103
Every image of the human form
is not art.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.080
Maybe it is.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.105
Really?

36:47.471 --> 36:50.475
Well, how about this one, Jane,
how does this make you feel?

36:55.413 --> 36:57.086
Is this art?

36:57.715 --> 36:59.661
Maybe I'm a great artist.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.611
Yeah, I don't dig them.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.713
I'm glad you do.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.614
Hm. Mm-hm. Hm.

37:30.615 --> 37:33.391
"Urban decay infects
every branch of society.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.589
'This hobbled, antiquated system
must be overhauled,' experts say.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.132
Otherwise, crime victims
are doubly injured.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.270
As one Bronx criminal court
judge put it:

37:41.425 --> 37:45.396
'What happened to our heroic
and robust rebuttals to violent crimes?"'

37:45.563 --> 37:47.270
That's clunky.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.502
Still, that is pretty good.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.010
What about mine?

37:55.506 --> 37:57.008
<i>Okay-</i>

37:57.174 --> 37:58.915
Novo-22, she's 18...

37:59.076 --> 38:01.784
...and she was raised
in the New York foster care system.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.449
Yeah, that's what the 22 means.
She was in 22...

38:04.615 --> 38:07.391
...different foster care homes
all over the city.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.189
While under the care
of the state of New York...

38:09.353 --> 38:11.799
...while our government
is supposed to protect her...

38:11.956 --> 38:14.061
...she's out painting train cars.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.231
What are you saying?

38:16.394 --> 38:17.805
You missed the story, Patti.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.533
What? Why do you say that?

38:20.698 --> 38:21.904
Because I did the math.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.170
Excuse me?

38:23.734 --> 38:26.510
How she sneaks into train yards...

38:26.671 --> 38:28.673
...and how much paint costs
isn't the story.

38:28.839 --> 38:32.582
The story is the state of New York
was responsible for this child.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.621
While under their
tax-dollar-supported care...

38:35.980 --> 38:38.688
...this minor was out
painting train cars all night.

38:38.849 --> 38:39.884
How does that happen?

38:40.051 --> 38:42.725
What--? Who lets that happen?

38:42.887 --> 38:44.389
I didn't--

38:45.589 --> 38:47.899
I don't know.
I didn't see that part of it.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.630
When you talk to a minor,
you focus on that part of it.

38:50.795 --> 38:53.366
Okay, I'll call social services,
and I'll get a comment.

38:53.531 --> 38:56.535
You'll need more than a comment,
you'll need names, dates, proof.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.539
You can't just write what you want.

38:59.737 --> 39:00.841
I didn't--

39:02.173 --> 39:03.743
I'm sorry.

39:04.108 --> 39:05.644
Go fix it.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.070
Hey, do you wanna go to
the ladies' room?

39:24.362 --> 39:25.932
No.

39:26.797 --> 39:28.902
Let's go to the ladies' room.

39:29.734 --> 39:30.906
<i>Okay-</i>

39:33.270 --> 39:35.341
What is going on?

39:38.275 --> 39:40.653
I'm an idiot.

39:41.078 --> 39:44.651
I'm an idiot, Patti.
I ruined my life.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.385
Ned?

39:47.518 --> 39:50.089
Okay, one guy cannot
ruin your whole life--

39:50.254 --> 39:54.100
No, he can.
My grandmother used to say:

39:54.258 --> 39:55.794
"Be good.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.906
And let those who will be clever."

39:58.062 --> 39:59.871
And she-- She warned me.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.010
She-- She warned me, Patti.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.168
Cindy.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.144
Cindy.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.213
Why did Ned do this?

40:10.674 --> 40:12.153
What did he do?

40:12.376 --> 40:14.879
He started it.

40:15.479 --> 40:18.119
He kissed m--

40:19.183 --> 40:22.721
He made me like him.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.761
You liked him because
he's a good guy.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.732
No. He's not good. He's an ass.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.328
You're right.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.240
I think that...

40:34.432 --> 40:38.073
...not every relationship
is meant to be long-term.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.543
You know?

40:40.070 --> 40:42.573
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.348
No, it's not.

40:45.843 --> 40:49.484
It's not gonna be okay, Patti, I--

40:49.647 --> 40:51.786
I told him--

40:52.316 --> 40:56.196
I told Lenny
that I fucked someone else...

40:56.353 --> 40:59.061
...and I don't have anywhere to go.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.829
L-- I-- I don't know where to go.

41:01.992 --> 41:04.768
Um, my place.

41:04.929 --> 41:08.103
You're gonna go to my place. Okay?

41:08.265 --> 41:10.541
And you can stay
for as long as you want.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.380
So don't worry about that. All right?

41:13.537 --> 41:15.710
_OkflY-
_OkflY-

41:20.010 --> 41:23.116
I wish that I could start over...

41:23.414 --> 41:27.226
...you know,
back before we did any of this.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.230
Is Lenny home right now?

41:33.791 --> 41:36.397
Uh, not till after 9.

41:36.560 --> 41:40.531
He has-- He has a study group.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.410
Great. Go home...

41:43.567 --> 41:45.808
...pack some stuff,
whatever you think you need.

41:46.136 --> 41:47.979
Bring it over to my place.

41:49.106 --> 41:53.179
I have a little more work to do,
but I will be home by 9, okay?

41:53.344 --> 41:55.585
_OkflY-
.l-ley-

41:55.779 --> 41:58.919
This is going to be fine.

42:14.164 --> 42:15.268
Hey, man.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.038
How you doing?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.112
Fine. Can you take my picture?

42:19.270 --> 42:20.840
Now? Like that?

42:21.005 --> 42:23.110
Yeah, exactly like this.

43:07.084 --> 43:08.290
Where you going?

43:08.452 --> 43:11.456
To-- To Patti's.

43:11.622 --> 43:15.468
- Is that where you were last night?
- It doesn't-- It doesn't matter.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.638
Okay, it doesn't.

43:20.831 --> 43:23.437
I never knew you were so unhappy.

43:30.474 --> 43:33.080
You said...

43:33.877 --> 43:36.016
...that I had a year.

43:39.149 --> 43:41.993
I knew you wanted
a family someday.

43:42.820 --> 43:45.198
And I convinced myself
that it was okay.

43:48.525 --> 43:50.163
I should have just told you.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.405
I'm sorry.

43:58.435 --> 43:59.937
And I know you are too.

44:06.276 --> 44:07.880
Cindy.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.720
This is our home.

44:11.048 --> 44:12.857
Your home.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.025
Don't leave.

44:17.287 --> 44:19.130
We'll talk about it.

44:19.289 --> 44:21.792
We'll-- We'll talk about everything.

44:25.029 --> 44:28.306
We'll open a bottle of wine,
and we'll talk about everything.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.650
- Ms. Hollander.
- Hm?

45:09.807 --> 45:10.808
I saw you come in...

45:10.974 --> 45:12.851
-...but I was on the phone.
- Mm-hm.

45:13.010 --> 45:15.217
Here. This came for you
about an hour ago.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.518
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:05.462 --> 46:11.174
No, I don't have her full name. I know she
was in the foster system from '64 to '69.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.881
She might have gone by Novo.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.348
Yeah, I know, it's late.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.352
I'll try again tomorrow.
Thank you so much.

46:44.535 --> 46:45.570
Robinson.

46:45.736 --> 46:47.044
You're still here.

46:47.871 --> 46:50.408
Come. I have something for you.

46:55.479 --> 46:56.787
How's Rhodes?

46:59.850 --> 47:01.124
Intense.

47:01.985 --> 47:02.986
All right...

47:03.153 --> 47:05.565
...these are a gift.

47:07.524 --> 47:08.559
Uh...

47:08.792 --> 47:10.567
You have to use them.

47:15.999 --> 47:19.105
Hard Chargers of Jazz at McDougal's.

47:19.269 --> 47:22.341
The lineup is first-rate.
But make sure you stay for McCoy Tyner.

47:22.506 --> 47:25.180
If you don't like him,
may God have mercy on your soul.

47:25.642 --> 47:27.212
Thank you.

47:28.145 --> 47:31.251
Pleasure. Bring someone
who will enjoy it.

47:31.582 --> 47:34.085
Bring someone who will appreciate it.
