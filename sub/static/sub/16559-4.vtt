00:00.921 --> 00:02.173
Previously on "How to
Get Away with Murder"...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.675
-Who the hell is this?
-Laurel. Hi.

00:04.675 --> 00:07.468
If the police hadn't caught
my father, I would've run away.

00:07.468 --> 00:08.969
Ms. Atwood
inferred that no one

00:08.969 --> 00:10.091
would negotiate with me.

00:10.091 --> 00:11.342
That is a lie,
Your Honor.

00:11.342 --> 00:12.633
You killed
two innocent women.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.225
Say you'll take the deal!

00:14.225 --> 00:15.306
Say it!

00:15.306 --> 00:16.687
Look.

00:16.687 --> 00:17.638
President Hargrove?

00:17.638 --> 00:19.019
What is it?

00:19.019 --> 00:19.850
Barry Lewiston
is on the phone.

00:19.850 --> 00:20.731
Hi, Barry.

00:20.731 --> 00:22.022
I've been stressing about

00:22.022 --> 00:23.354
what to get you
for your birthday

00:23.354 --> 00:24.605
while you're into
some other girl.

00:24.605 --> 00:25.696
You're the good thing
in my life.

00:25.696 --> 00:26.817
Not Laurel.

00:28.239 --> 00:29.490
So, he could be anywhere.

00:29.490 --> 00:31.282
I'm gonna stay at your house
till we find him.

00:31.282 --> 00:32.613
Hey, Frank.

00:32.613 --> 00:33.824
She tried to kill me,
Laurel.

00:33.824 --> 00:35.246
We were able to find
your boyfriend

00:35.246 --> 00:37.078
in a town called Coalport.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.209
Did he find Frank?

00:38.209 --> 00:40.501
Yes, but he wouldn't
tell me where he was.

00:40.501 --> 00:42.423
-Talk to me.
-We have another occupant

00:42.423 --> 00:44.795
There's a pulse.
I repeat, we have a pulse.

00:46.087 --> 00:49.009
Who is it?
Tell me!

00:51.802 --> 00:53.634
Annalise Keating,
you're under arrest.

00:53.634 --> 00:56.016
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say...

00:56.016 --> 00:58.179
Wipe it clean.

01:10.781 --> 01:12.032
I'm sorry
it took so long.

01:12.032 --> 01:13.073
Do you know what
they're charging me with?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.535
No, not yet.
You have to find out.

01:14.535 --> 01:15.616
I know.
I can't just stay in here

01:15.616 --> 01:16.787
until they
throw the book at me.

01:16.787 --> 01:18.249
Annalise.

01:18.249 --> 01:21.332
They found another body
in the house.

01:21.332 --> 01:24.625
They're alive,
but we don't know who it is.

01:31.802 --> 01:33.514
Pupils are reactive.

01:33.514 --> 01:35.556
I need two large bore I.V.s.
Start fluids at 150.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.680
There's a lot of soot
in the mucus membrane.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.682
X-ray's on its way, and I sent
for the blood gas and CBC.

01:41.682 --> 01:42.893
How bad are the burns?

01:42.893 --> 01:45.146
Roughly 9% BSA
in the right arm and leg.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.647
O2 stats are dropping.

01:46.647 --> 01:49.150
Probably smoke inhalation.
We need to intubate.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.111
Give me
the fiber-optic device.

02:38.579 --> 02:39.740

02:39.740 --> 02:41.242
So, what's up
with those fliers?

02:41.242 --> 02:42.833
Did they find the creep
who put them up?

02:42.833 --> 02:45.836
Let's just not talk about
my disaster of a life.

02:45.836 --> 02:48.168
That just leaves us
to talk about my boring life.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.920
I'd kill for a boring life
right now.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.502
You let Nate move in.
That's pretty boring.

02:53.344 --> 02:54.965
Is it the sex?
It's that good?

02:54.965 --> 02:56.677
We're not doing this.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.099
You're right.
I don't want to know.

02:59.099 --> 03:00.431
You're happy, I'm happy.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.802
I didn't say I was happy.

03:01.802 --> 03:04.605
Stressed out, pissed off,
lonely, sure, but -- oh.

03:06.517 --> 03:09.069
Let me guess, you just got
promoted to partner at Saatchi,

03:09.069 --> 03:11.652
and you're helping
your friend celebrate?

03:11.652 --> 03:13.654
I got partner
a long time ago,

03:13.654 --> 03:16.407
and my friend here
is actually my girlfriend.

03:16.407 --> 03:17.778
Lesbian Heisman.

03:17.778 --> 03:20.120
That's good. We haven't
seen that one in a while.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.912
It's fine if you're
not interested.

03:21.912 --> 03:22.993
We can handle that.

03:22.993 --> 03:25.496
Oh, no, we're interested
in free drinks.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.249
Good, uh, but just to be clear,
you are or are not gay?

03:28.249 --> 03:29.630
I'm gay. She's...

03:29.630 --> 03:30.791
It's complicated.

03:30.791 --> 03:33.133
Awesome.
We're litigators.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.095
We do complicated
for a living.

04:30.941 --> 04:32.272
No, officer.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.274
I took a cab.

04:36.657 --> 04:38.158
Okay,
let's get you to bed.

04:38.158 --> 04:39.950
No, no, no, no, no.
I can do this.

04:39.950 --> 04:42.072
I can do this much.

04:46.827 --> 04:50.040
Okay, okay. Here we go.
All right.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.582
All right, no,
I can't do this.

05:04.094 --> 05:05.766
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I know.

05:05.766 --> 05:09.099
Okay. All right.

05:20.741 --> 05:22.443
I'm coming.

05:28.869 --> 05:29.790
You're late.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.001
I'm here now.

05:31.001 --> 05:33.584
Money?

05:38.008 --> 05:41.552
Careful where you stow it,
or you'll blow yourself up.

05:41.552 --> 05:42.463
I'm good.

06:00.691 --> 06:03.073
It's Frank.
Leave a message.

06:03.073 --> 06:05.115
It's me.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.489
I got rid of my old phone for
reasons I'll explain in person.

06:08.489 --> 06:12.162
Just -- this is my new number.

06:12.162 --> 06:13.794
Please call me.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.047
You coming?

06:23.213 --> 06:26.266
Dude, you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

06:26.266 --> 06:28.058
It's just a gland issue.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.641
I just -- when that, you know,
"All rise" hits, it's go time.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.434
I'm all like "Pow, pow" with
legal hooks, cross-exam jabs,

06:33.434 --> 06:35.776
and you got
nothing to worry about.

06:35.776 --> 06:38.689
It's going to be fine.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.230
Is that sweat?

06:40.230 --> 06:42.483
Like, it's making its
way through his suit jacket?

06:42.483 --> 06:44.404
Ain't jealousy
a bitch?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.826
Please. Annalise only
picked your boyfriend

06:45.826 --> 06:47.157
for this case 'cause
he's hooked up

06:47.157 --> 06:48.739
to one of her teats
like the rest of you.

06:48.739 --> 06:50.491
Wait, we're calling him
your boyfriend now?

06:50.491 --> 06:52.493
God no. It's just sex.

06:52.493 --> 06:53.454
Pretty good sex
from all the noise

06:53.454 --> 06:54.535
you two have been making.

06:54.535 --> 06:56.206
Uh, you want to
sleep on the street?

06:56.206 --> 06:57.628
'Cause I'm happy
to have my couch back.

06:57.628 --> 06:58.959
Yeah, well, that
might happen if I keep

06:58.959 --> 07:00.000
hitting the jackpot
at your building.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.341
What does that mean?

07:01.341 --> 07:03.173
The silver fox,
the -- the one from

07:03.173 --> 07:04.635
the fifth floor,
he invited me over

07:04.635 --> 07:06.547
for dinner tonight,
but I'm pretty sure

07:06.547 --> 07:07.848
the only thing I'm gonna
be eating is --

07:07.848 --> 07:09.099
Are you kidding me?
This is a courtroom --

07:09.099 --> 07:10.140
maybe not
the most appropriate place

07:10.140 --> 07:11.181
to be discussing
your sex life.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.142
Are you jealous
because you don't have

07:12.142 --> 07:13.514
a sex life of your own?

07:13.514 --> 07:15.015
If you want, I can
give you some pointers.

07:15.015 --> 07:16.857
Oliver's been giving me all
the pointers I need, thanks.

07:21.061 --> 07:22.362
Where have you been?

07:22.362 --> 07:23.904
Hungover.
What's wrong?

07:23.904 --> 07:25.445
I just wanted to introduce you
to the character witnesses.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.568
Uh, guys,
Professor Keating.

07:27.568 --> 07:29.449
This is Rosette,
Susan, Jeremy.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.241
We're some of
Tristan's teachers.

07:31.241 --> 07:33.373
Thank you so much
for taking this case.

07:33.373 --> 07:35.205
Honestly, you're
our hero right now.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.206
Thank Mr. Millstone.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.838
He's doing
all the heavy lifting.

07:40.751 --> 07:44.505
Be on your "A" game, because
my brain is steeped in vodka.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.680
All rise!

07:51.932 --> 07:54.224
As you can see here,
the juvenile is on video

07:54.224 --> 07:56.767
taking out the maximum amount
allowed on the credit card --

07:56.767 --> 07:58.188
$1,000.

07:58.188 --> 08:01.021
This is just one example
of how Tristan Fullerton

08:01.021 --> 08:05.065
used fake credit cards
to steal a total of $41,000

08:05.065 --> 08:06.527
over the last two months --

08:06.527 --> 08:08.699
money he claims
he can't pay back.

08:08.699 --> 08:11.071
So, the state is recommending
the maximum sentencing

08:11.071 --> 08:14.074
of seven years
in juvenile detention.

08:14.074 --> 08:16.537
The floor is yours, young man.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.417
You sure you shouldn't
just do this?

08:17.417 --> 08:19.079
I mean, he just nailed it --
Get up.

08:29.429 --> 08:32.593
Sorry, uh,
Tristan Fullerton was raised

08:32.593 --> 08:34.805
in the streets of Nicetown,
which actually

08:34.805 --> 08:37.728
should've been called Meantown
due to it having

08:37.728 --> 08:39.810
a very high crime rate --
crime that visited

08:39.810 --> 08:42.563
Tristan's own home
in the form of abuse.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.856
He ended up
in foster care as a result,

08:45.856 --> 08:50.951
getting moved from one home
to another to another.

08:52.743 --> 08:56.536
Getting moved from one home
to another to another.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.498
Oh, God, tell me
when it's over.

08:58.498 --> 09:01.081
Now as a result
of these charges,

09:01.081 --> 09:04.795
he's been moved once again
to his seventh foster home.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.257
Your Honor, I ask
that you censure the prosecution

09:07.257 --> 09:09.339
for this rude display
of whispering!

09:09.339 --> 09:11.091
My apologies, Judge,

09:11.091 --> 09:13.343
but I just, uh, found out
that the juvenile here

09:13.343 --> 09:15.636
is represented
by an unlicensed lawyer.

09:15.636 --> 09:19.559
Mr. Millstone is one of my law
students I've been supervising.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.391
Oh, I was talking
about you, Ms. Keating.

09:21.391 --> 09:22.853
My office just
received this fax

09:22.853 --> 09:25.686
from the Disciplinary Board
stating that your license

09:25.686 --> 09:27.487
has been placed under
immediate suspension

09:27.487 --> 09:29.740
due to gross misconduct.

09:31.692 --> 09:34.454
Ms. Keating, is this true?

09:42.462 --> 09:44.875
This was a private
courthouse meeting.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.087
My interaction with
my client is privileged.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.509
It's physical assault,
Annalise.

09:49.509 --> 09:50.971
Who sent this?

09:50.971 --> 09:52.633
That doesn't matter.
Was it the D.A.'s office?

09:52.633 --> 09:54.384
I mean, who could
get their hands on this?

09:54.384 --> 09:56.927
You can defend yourself
at the disciplinary hearing

09:56.927 --> 09:58.889
next week.
I run a pro bono
legal clinic.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.891
My clients are immigrants,
poor children.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.562
They need me
to do my job right now.

10:02.562 --> 10:04.184
And a violation
of this manner

10:04.184 --> 10:07.898
demands we immediately
suspend your license.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.029
I'm sorry.

10:15.996 --> 10:17.327
Damn!

10:17.327 --> 10:19.239
You got a mean right.

10:19.239 --> 10:21.041
Oh, stop.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.126
It was the D.A.'s office.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.748
I humiliated
Atwood in court,

10:27.748 --> 10:29.710
and it's their way
of hitting back.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.591
You want me
to dig around?

10:33.924 --> 10:36.386
Hey.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.138
It's gonna be okay.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.349
I know.

10:39.349 --> 10:42.352
It's just the worst day
to be hungover.

10:42.352 --> 10:44.564
Well, maybe don't
let Bonnie take you

10:44.564 --> 10:46.606
out drinking
on a school night anymore.

10:47.858 --> 10:49.439
It's my fault.

10:49.439 --> 10:51.191
I insisted on that
second bottle of champagne.

10:51.191 --> 10:53.944
Like I didn't already know that.

10:55.866 --> 10:57.537
Is what
the prosecutor said true?

10:57.537 --> 10:58.989
You guys can't
defend me anymore?

10:58.989 --> 11:00.330
My license is up to date,

11:00.330 --> 11:02.703
so the case will continue
as scheduled tomorrow.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.706
And him, he's still gonna be
the first chair or whatever?

11:05.706 --> 11:07.167
Dude, okay, I wasn't
that bad, all right?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.418
We'd be in much better shape

11:08.418 --> 11:09.920
if you just told us
what you did with the money.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.171
I spent it.
I told you.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.213
On what? 'Cause real talk,
man, you have one drawer

11:13.213 --> 11:15.175
at a group home and Air Jordans
from four seasons ago.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.256
Asher.
Look, I grew up
spending money

11:16.256 --> 11:17.677
and even I couldn't
blow through that much coin

11:17.677 --> 11:18.889
in two months
when I was 15.

11:18.889 --> 11:20.430
Sit down!

11:22.352 --> 11:24.014
Over there.

11:31.361 --> 11:33.734
He's right.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.236
This all goes away
if you give back the money.

11:36.236 --> 11:38.368
No more court.

11:38.368 --> 11:39.659
No time in juvie.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.785
The money's gone.

11:44.785 --> 11:47.497
How many times do I have
to tell you guys that?

11:47.497 --> 11:50.090
Our client is young,
dumb, and suffers from

11:50.090 --> 11:51.591
teenage brain disease.

11:51.591 --> 11:53.633
As we all know,
the adolescent brain

11:53.633 --> 11:55.545
is more reckless
than the adult's.

11:55.545 --> 11:59.760
Right? How they barely think
about anything other than sex...

11:59.760 --> 12:04.014
...and sex and sex.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.146
Just like some
other boys we know.

12:06.146 --> 12:07.768
How are you thinking about sex
when we just found out

12:07.768 --> 12:09.689
Annalise's entire career
imploded?

12:09.689 --> 12:11.772
Oliver made his bed.
I'm just sleeping in it.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.854
-You know he can hear you.
-I don't mind.

12:13.854 --> 12:15.065
Really.

12:15.065 --> 12:17.818
He's single.
Sex is a healthy part of that.

12:17.818 --> 12:19.489
Besides, I'm on Humpr, too.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.031
Oh, give me your phone.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.863
I'm really good
at picking out guys.

12:22.863 --> 12:24.454
-Since when?
-No, you're not.

12:24.454 --> 12:26.076
-I'm not sure that's true.
-Hey, bad table.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.707
Since you guys
are all so distracted,

12:27.707 --> 12:29.369
how about you do some work
gathering research

12:29.369 --> 12:31.671
that speaks to the sad state
of the teenage brain?

12:31.671 --> 12:33.133
-I have a question.
-Did I say it was time

12:33.133 --> 12:34.714
for questions?
-It's for her, actually.

12:34.714 --> 12:37.507
If Annalise is suspended, is it
even legal to help this kid?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.469
Yes because I'm now
in charge of this case.

12:39.469 --> 12:40.340
Sit down.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.432
Sir!

12:42.432 --> 12:44.384
Goofy-looking table,
I need you guys...

12:44.384 --> 12:46.146
You should hack into
the Disciplinary Board e-mails,

12:46.146 --> 12:47.267
find out
who sent the video.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.099
He doesn't
hack anymore.

12:49.099 --> 12:50.600
You do know you don't
speak for him anymore.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.022
He's right, I don't.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.234
Unless
Annalise asks me to.

12:54.234 --> 12:57.397
Oliver, now you're just
hurting my feelings, bud.

12:57.397 --> 12:58.398
I'm sorry.

12:58.398 --> 12:59.739
You could make it up to me

12:59.739 --> 13:01.741
by using your big nerd brain
to follow the money.

13:01.741 --> 13:05.365
Okay? Do whatever
legal techno mumbo jumbo

13:05.365 --> 13:08.038
you have to and figure out
where our shady little liar

13:08.038 --> 13:08.999
is hiding all of his dough.

13:08.999 --> 13:09.910
On it.

13:09.910 --> 13:11.541
Can I help
Oliver with that?

13:11.541 --> 13:12.963
Whatever you want.

13:12.963 --> 13:15.005
All right, let's
get to work, people.

13:15.005 --> 13:17.177
Think about how well
everyone's gonna sleep tonight

13:17.177 --> 13:21.551
when we realize that we've saved
the life of a poor young man.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.513
Where are you going?

13:23.513 --> 13:24.975
Research library.

13:24.975 --> 13:26.516
I remembered this brief
about presenting

13:26.516 --> 13:30.100
mitigating factors
on juvie cases, so...

13:31.431 --> 13:33.894
Have you ever heard of
the town called Coalport?

13:33.894 --> 13:35.065
Nope.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.356
Why?

13:36.356 --> 13:39.609
I got a missed call
from there last week.

13:39.609 --> 13:40.820
I don't know who it was --

13:40.820 --> 13:44.284
But you was hoping
that it was from Frank.

13:44.284 --> 13:47.787
Look, my son can be
a real jackass with girls,

13:47.787 --> 13:51.211
but I'd probably go AWOL
every now and then, too,

13:51.211 --> 13:54.254
if I'd been beat up
in life like Frankie has.

13:54.254 --> 13:56.006
You mean by Annalise?

13:56.006 --> 13:58.508
No, I mean
by his time in jail.

13:58.508 --> 14:01.341
It was Annalise and Sam
that saved him from that hell.

14:12.642 --> 14:14.604
No, really.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.686
Maybe the computer will
change its mind the next time.

14:16.686 --> 14:19.609
Sorry, I'm just not sure how
I'm supposed to clean in there.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.860
You're not.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.283
That's why you don't
have clearance.

14:23.283 --> 14:24.154
Name's Kevin.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.785
I'm new.

14:25.785 --> 14:28.448
Stay in your lane, Kevin.

14:28.448 --> 14:29.829
Sir, yes, sir.

14:39.499 --> 14:41.091
Everything's under control.

14:41.091 --> 14:42.802
They all think I work
for the university.

14:42.802 --> 14:44.714
Good.
Just keep them distracted.

14:44.714 --> 14:46.636
On it. I'll call you
if I need anything.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.268
Bonnie.
Yeah?

14:48.268 --> 14:50.100
If Nate asks,
tell him that

14:50.100 --> 14:52.432
you went to dinner
with me last night.

14:52.432 --> 14:53.563
Okay.

14:53.563 --> 14:54.724
Thank you.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.979
BonBon!
O-man found something.

14:58.979 --> 15:00.520
Actually, it was my idea
that led to the finding.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.861
Where is it?

15:01.861 --> 15:03.363
We accessed Tristan's
bus pass account.

15:03.363 --> 15:04.734
The accessing might not
have been totally legal.

15:04.734 --> 15:06.286
Shh.
I got it.

15:06.286 --> 15:08.618
Each week, he takes
the 139 out to Port Richmond.

15:08.618 --> 15:09.909
It's the warehouse district.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.331
There's nothing there --

15:11.331 --> 15:12.832
Except for --
wait for it --

15:12.832 --> 15:14.494
A storage unit
facility.

15:26.006 --> 15:29.469
You, uh -- you into some
kinky baby play or something?

15:29.469 --> 15:31.681
Tristan.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.223
Do you have a girlfriend?

15:33.223 --> 15:35.555
Yeah.
She's due in five months.

15:35.555 --> 15:37.897
The baby's
gonna need things.

15:37.897 --> 15:39.859
I don't want it
to grow up like me.

15:39.859 --> 15:42.692
This actually
helps your case.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.985
We can tell the judge you were
trying to do the right thing.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.826
You can't tell anyone.

15:46.826 --> 15:49.029
Because her parents don't know?

15:49.029 --> 15:50.910
The school.

15:50.910 --> 15:51.951
That's where she works.

15:54.574 --> 15:57.037
I'm sorry to
drag you back in here.

15:57.037 --> 15:58.918
We just wanted to make sure
you felt fully prepared

15:58.918 --> 16:00.170
to take the stand.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.382
Oh, I totally get it.
I'm happy to do

16:02.382 --> 16:03.713
whatever I can to make sure

16:03.713 --> 16:06.586
Tristan doesn't get lost
in the system.

16:06.586 --> 16:07.797
Exactly.

16:07.797 --> 16:09.589
He's suffered enough.

16:12.932 --> 16:14.094
When did you first
meet Tristan?

16:14.094 --> 16:19.149
Last year. He was in
my sophomore biology class.

16:19.149 --> 16:20.100
And did the school
make you aware

16:20.100 --> 16:22.482
of his background
before that?

16:22.482 --> 16:23.563
Namely that he had been

16:23.563 --> 16:25.065
physically abused
by his parents?

16:25.065 --> 16:27.107
Yes. The district
informs us

16:27.107 --> 16:28.778
of any difficulties at home

16:28.778 --> 16:31.201
so that we may
better understand the child.

16:31.201 --> 16:33.073
Did it surprise you
when you heard

16:33.073 --> 16:35.375
that Tristan was being
accused of credit-card theft?

16:35.375 --> 16:38.958
Yes. That's not at all
the Tristan I've come to know.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.620
Do you think it's possible

16:40.620 --> 16:43.253
that Tristan stole this money
to help out someone?

16:43.253 --> 16:46.466
A girlfriend, boyfriend?

16:46.466 --> 16:50.630
I...guess it's possible.

16:50.630 --> 16:55.095
Was there a significant other
you ever saw him with then?

16:55.095 --> 16:56.896
No.

16:56.896 --> 16:58.348
Tristan's one of those kids

16:58.348 --> 17:01.901
who always just had
his head buried in a book.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.904
That's not all
his head was buried in.

17:04.904 --> 17:06.316
Do not make jokes
right now.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.987
Sorry.
So, what's next?

17:07.987 --> 17:09.739
We go to the D.A.,
tell him that Tristan's ready

17:09.739 --> 17:10.650
to testify against
Susie Sex Ed?

17:10.650 --> 17:12.282
No.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.454
Susan wants to testify tomorrow,
so let's have a little fun

17:14.454 --> 17:16.035
and make her confess
on the stand.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.747
Sounds a little risky,
though, no?

17:17.747 --> 17:19.289
What's risky is giving
a child abuser

17:19.289 --> 17:21.501
time to get a lawyer
and deny the whole thing.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.543
She's pregnant with his kid.
I mean, there's no denying it.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.545
And what if she claims
he was the aggressor?

17:25.545 --> 17:26.966
You think anyone
ever believes the child

17:26.966 --> 17:28.968
in situations like this?

17:28.968 --> 17:32.382
Oh, my God, this is
about what your dad did?

17:32.382 --> 17:36.136
I'm sorry to even
bring it up, but...

17:36.136 --> 17:38.558
But you
brought it up anyway.

17:42.442 --> 17:46.446
You stood by while your buddies
raped Tiffany Howard.

17:46.446 --> 17:47.947
Does that mean
you can't separate

17:47.947 --> 17:49.779
your personal feelings
from an abuse case, too?

17:49.779 --> 17:52.532
Or is it just me
who's the mess here?

17:52.532 --> 17:56.496
No, I -- I didn't
mean it that way.

17:56.496 --> 17:58.288
Get your own ride home.

18:11.551 --> 18:13.383
Nate?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.265
Hey.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.139
I heard you were
back in the uniform.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.181
Yeah, a while ago.

18:21.181 --> 18:22.182
Surprised I haven't
run into you.

18:22.182 --> 18:23.933
I never leave my office.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.685
That's a good way
to avoid trouble.

18:25.685 --> 18:29.819
Yeah, well, my life could use
a little trouble these days.

18:29.819 --> 18:31.110
I know I shouldn't
bring this up,

18:31.110 --> 18:34.284
but genius play hitting
Keating with that suspension.

18:34.284 --> 18:35.825
What are you talking about?

18:35.825 --> 18:37.697
Someone sent a tape of her
smacking her client

18:37.697 --> 18:39.118
to the Disciplinary Board.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.870
Okay, one --
I can't believe

18:40.870 --> 18:43.002
no one in the office
told me about this.

18:43.002 --> 18:44.914
Two --
she hit her own client?

18:44.914 --> 18:46.506
Yeah.

18:46.506 --> 18:49.669
Good Lord, she's even more
far gone than I thought.

18:49.669 --> 18:52.342
You definitely want
to avoid a formal hearing.

18:52.342 --> 18:54.634
They'll enjoy punishing you
in public too much.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.596
Better to just make
a statement in private,

18:56.596 --> 18:58.718
promise to go to
anger-management classes.

18:58.718 --> 19:00.640
I'll probably hit
people there, too.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.432
I really need to retire.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.143
The Sam insurance money
is that good?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.855
I spent it all.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.317
I could sell the house.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.068
Oh, God, yes, do that.

19:09.068 --> 19:10.360
I've lived in here
forever.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.611
Yeah, and look
what happened.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.539
I'm sorry.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.282
Okay, let's say you retire.

19:22.282 --> 19:23.873
Sell the house,
move somewhere quiet --

19:23.873 --> 19:25.044
I hate the quiet.

19:25.044 --> 19:27.166
Then move to a city --

19:27.166 --> 19:28.668
a real city like
New York or Chicago.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.590
What the hell am I gonna
do in the city?

19:30.590 --> 19:32.792
Move in with you,
become your trophy wife?

19:32.792 --> 19:35.215
I'm down for that.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.353
So, what'd you do
with the insurance money?

19:45.605 --> 19:48.358
I hired a hit man
to kill Frank.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.612
Are we really doing this?

19:52.612 --> 19:55.315
I hope so.

19:56.656 --> 19:57.867
Hurry.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.579
Just do it.

20:04.374 --> 20:05.665
How do you
even know a hit man?

20:05.665 --> 20:07.086
He wasn't
really a hit man.

20:07.086 --> 20:08.498
You just said he was.

20:08.498 --> 20:12.422
Well, I-I just wanted him
to find Frank, that's all.

20:12.422 --> 20:13.833
And what was he supposed
to do once he found him?

20:13.833 --> 20:15.715
Well, I never got the chance
to make that decision.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.427
You made the decision
the minute you hired him.

20:17.427 --> 20:19.639
He killed my son.

20:22.512 --> 20:27.267
Maybe not
with his own hands, but...

20:27.267 --> 20:32.272
in what world do I not
make him pay for that?

20:32.272 --> 20:33.653
Tell me.

20:39.028 --> 20:39.909
Come here.

20:39.909 --> 20:41.200
Oh, stop.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.242
No, you stop.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.257
It's okay.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.932
I didn't say to kill him.

21:02.932 --> 21:04.263
I know, I know.

21:11.691 --> 21:13.693
Nate, hi.

21:13.693 --> 21:16.025
Hey.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.527
I didn't know
you were in town.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.899
Yeah, I'm at this
conference for a few days.

21:19.899 --> 21:23.242
Came over to help with
the whole suspension mess.

21:23.242 --> 21:25.405
Right.

21:28.368 --> 21:30.249
Did you find out anything?

21:30.249 --> 21:32.251
Talked to Atwood.
I don't think she's behind it.

22:08.247 --> 22:09.158
Hello?

22:09.158 --> 22:11.711
Hey, Laurel, it's Meggy.

22:11.711 --> 22:13.082
Sorry for the cold call.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.455
I-I had to sneak into Wes's
phone to get your number.

22:15.455 --> 22:17.667
Is everything okay?
Totally.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.009
Just I'm thinking about doing
something for his birthday,

22:20.009 --> 22:22.382
and I wanted to know
if you'd help.

22:22.382 --> 22:27.136
Oh, um...hang on,
let me just go outside.

22:27.136 --> 22:28.808
It's not hot.
It's rape.

22:28.808 --> 22:30.810
So, you're saying that
me hooking up with

22:30.810 --> 22:32.812
my camp counselor when
I was 14, that was rape?

22:32.812 --> 22:34.273
If he was over 18, yes.

22:34.273 --> 22:36.065
But I mean, if you ask any guy,
most would be willing

22:36.065 --> 22:38.357
to give their left nut to sleep
with their high school teacher.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.029
Mm-hmm.
Mrs. Alvarez.

22:40.029 --> 22:41.571
It's not the same.

22:41.571 --> 22:42.692
Tristan has
a history of abuse,

22:42.692 --> 22:43.943
and Susan
took advantage of that.

22:43.943 --> 22:45.194
It's not okay.
Thank you.

22:45.194 --> 22:46.616
Bonnie shouldn't be
doing this, though, right?

22:46.616 --> 22:48.287
I mean, the plan is insane.

22:48.287 --> 22:50.750
Yeah, seriously. She's trying
to be Annalise all of a sudden?

22:50.750 --> 22:53.623
Annalise got suspended
for bitch slapping a client.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.204
I'm not sure any of us
should want to be her anymore.

22:55.204 --> 22:57.627
Where were you?

22:57.627 --> 22:58.998
The bathroom.

22:58.998 --> 23:00.670
Is that okay with you?

23:04.844 --> 23:07.717
Okay, enough. We get it.
You want to hurt Oliver back.

23:07.717 --> 23:09.639
Look, this might be
difficult for all of you

23:09.639 --> 23:11.511
straight people
to understand,

23:11.511 --> 23:14.934
but not all sex
is a big deal.

23:14.934 --> 23:17.356
Well, it's always
a "big" deal with me.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.108
You're ridiculous,
and you've got a problem.

23:19.108 --> 23:21.150
No, I've got game.

in proving it.

Ooh, what about

24:02.151 --> 24:03.613
He's kind of
out of my league.

24:03.613 --> 24:06.445
Ah! So, that's a yes.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.327
Mmm, Jason.

24:08.327 --> 24:11.330
He says
he's "dom masc BB."

24:11.330 --> 24:12.912
What does BB stand for?

24:12.912 --> 24:13.913
Big balls?

24:13.913 --> 24:15.034
Oh, my -- no.

24:15.034 --> 24:16.626
Seriously.

24:16.626 --> 24:18.167
Look, I found
who e-mailed the slap.

24:18.167 --> 24:20.129
Ooh, who sent it?

24:20.129 --> 24:22.341
Barry Lewiston.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.795
Barry Lewiston,
a board member

24:25.795 --> 24:27.717
of this university,
was the one who e-mailed

24:27.717 --> 24:29.759
the video of me
to get my license suspended.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.431
Before we jump
to any conclusions,

24:32.431 --> 24:34.093
know that this is the first
I'm hearing about any --

24:34.093 --> 24:35.354
I don't believe you.

24:35.354 --> 24:37.897
Then don't, but if
what you're saying is true --

24:37.897 --> 24:38.978
I have proof
that it's true.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.310
Fine.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.272
But don't pretend
this comes as a surprise.

24:43.272 --> 24:44.363
You took on

24:44.363 --> 24:46.445
a multi-million-dollar
corporation.

24:46.445 --> 24:47.817
Did you really think
they were gonna fight fair?

24:47.817 --> 24:48.868
So what,
are you condoning this?

24:48.868 --> 24:50.570
I'm saying your behavior
on this campus

24:50.570 --> 24:52.371
has been inappropriate,
unprofessional --

24:52.371 --> 24:54.704
At least I haven't acted
illegally, unlike your board.

24:54.704 --> 24:56.455
Until now.
What does that mean?

24:56.455 --> 24:57.537
How's your clinic
still running

24:57.537 --> 24:59.038
if your license
has been suspended?

24:59.038 --> 25:00.670
My client is
a 15-year-old foster child.

25:00.670 --> 25:02.882
You want us to
abandon him mid-trial?

25:02.882 --> 25:04.333
I want you to abide

25:04.333 --> 25:06.836
by the conditions
of your employment.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.888
Just like every other
professor on this campus.

25:08.888 --> 25:10.179
How many
of those professors

25:10.179 --> 25:12.051
have their faces printed
on inflammatory fliers?

25:12.051 --> 25:14.303
And where are you in
that investigation, anyway?

25:14.303 --> 25:16.095
Or is Barry Lewiston
behind those, too?

25:16.095 --> 25:18.187
Annalise --
You people want
a fight, I'll fight.

25:18.187 --> 25:20.139
Listen.
You forget that
my ability for kicking ass

25:20.139 --> 25:21.100
is precisely
why you hired me.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.233
Shut up, Annalise!

25:24.233 --> 25:26.736
You come in here
yelling at me, your boss,

25:26.736 --> 25:28.527
and you think that's gonna
get you what you want?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.949
It won't.

25:29.949 --> 25:32.822
So let me put
this simply for you.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.574
There's a saying
where I come from --

25:34.574 --> 25:36.866
whoever can't hear must feel.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.958
So do it.

25:38.958 --> 25:40.159
Make me feel.

25:40.159 --> 25:41.711
Somebody already did.

25:41.711 --> 25:46.465
And now you've lost
your license to practice.

25:46.465 --> 25:50.089
Hurts, doesn't it?

25:50.089 --> 25:52.051
You can't fire me
because of this.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.933
Check your contract.

25:53.933 --> 25:58.477
Without a license,
your tenure gets nullified.

25:58.477 --> 26:00.519
Next time you want to meet,

26:00.519 --> 26:02.732
make an appointment
with my assistant.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.649
It's Frank.
Leave a message.

26:09.649 --> 26:13.653
Hey, I saw your dad yesterday.

26:13.653 --> 26:15.995
He told me
you went to jail once.

26:15.995 --> 26:19.288
But I guess I shouldn't be
surprised by that at this point.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.377
Hey.
Hey, um...

26:28.377 --> 26:29.588
Everything okay?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.630
Why do I feel like
I'm being

26:30.630 --> 26:31.841
interrogated by you
all the time?

26:31.841 --> 26:32.882
I'm not
interrogating you.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.213
I just want to know
what's wrong.

26:34.213 --> 26:35.214
Nothing's wrong.

26:35.214 --> 26:37.176
Then why are you being
so defensive?

26:37.176 --> 26:39.769
Look, if you don't
want to tell me, that's fine,

26:39.769 --> 26:43.102
but I just want
to be there for you.

26:48.728 --> 26:51.490
Meggy's throwing you
a surprise party tonight.

26:53.442 --> 26:55.284
I'm sorry, I ruined it.

26:55.284 --> 26:56.365
Or maybe it's better.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.867
Like, you hate your birthday

26:57.867 --> 27:01.040
or you think
surprise parties are horrible.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.954
No, just no one's ever thrown me
a birthday party before.

27:04.954 --> 27:08.547
Don't worry.
I will...play along.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.211
Are you about
to start sweating again?

27:12.211 --> 27:13.302
Yeah, you know me.

27:13.302 --> 27:15.254
-We ready?
-Yeah.

27:17.556 --> 27:19.098
Hey.

27:19.098 --> 27:21.020
Is Annalise
onboard with this?

27:21.020 --> 27:22.812
God, you don't
know when to quit.

27:22.812 --> 27:25.434
What you're about
to do to that kid is cruel.

27:25.434 --> 27:27.727
What's cruel is you
doubting me when I need

27:27.727 --> 27:30.029
to go destroy a witness,
so shut up,

27:30.029 --> 27:33.112
sit down at that table,
and support your boss.

27:48.287 --> 27:49.048
Kind of early for that.

27:49.048 --> 27:51.170
Not after the week
I've been having.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.712
You're already
back from work?

27:52.712 --> 27:54.173
Yeah.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.715
We should talk.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.139
You sleeping with Eve?

28:02.061 --> 28:04.263
Would it bother you
if I were?

28:04.263 --> 28:06.565
Screw who you want, but don't
have me living up in here --

28:06.565 --> 28:07.686
It was your choice
to move in.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.398
Cause you thought Frank was
gonna put a bullet in your head

28:09.398 --> 28:11.070
So get out.

28:11.070 --> 28:12.902
I'd rather be alone.

28:12.902 --> 28:14.483
You're an alcoholic.
Of course I am.

28:14.483 --> 28:15.815
And that's not just
the vodka talking.

28:15.815 --> 28:17.236
That's the me
I've always been.

28:17.236 --> 28:18.868
And unfortunately,
you're the same you --

28:18.868 --> 28:20.579
so patient, so accommodating.

28:20.579 --> 28:22.161
Not used to that in a man?
That's a problem for you?

28:22.161 --> 28:25.454
No, the problem is
you're a little bitch!

28:25.454 --> 28:27.036
That surprise you, huh?

28:27.036 --> 28:28.457
You want to hit me?

28:28.457 --> 28:29.538
Go ahead, hit me.

28:29.538 --> 28:30.669
Hit me!

28:30.669 --> 28:34.043
Hit me!

28:34.043 --> 28:35.174
You're a cancer.

28:35.174 --> 28:35.965
Oh, that's all you got?

28:35.965 --> 28:36.836
That's why Sam cheated.

28:36.836 --> 28:37.676
Even Frank ran off.

28:37.676 --> 28:38.888
You're cowards, all of you.

28:38.888 --> 28:40.099
Who are you gonna
ruin next, Eve?

28:40.099 --> 28:41.680
Eve's got more balls
than all of you!

28:41.680 --> 28:43.302
Eve don't know you.
You don't know me.

28:43.302 --> 28:44.723
You're gonna die alone
in this house.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.846
That's what I know, and no one's
gonna give a rat's ass.

28:46.846 --> 28:49.058
Not me, not Eve,
not even your damn mother

28:49.058 --> 28:52.441
once she realizes
how sick you really are.

28:55.985 --> 28:59.238
You're still standing here.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.990
Get help.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.507
Your first
witness, Ms. Winterbottom.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.929
I'd like to call my client's
biology teacher, Susan Boatman,

29:19.929 --> 29:23.142
to the stand.

29:23.142 --> 29:24.934
Wow, she really does
think she's Annalise.

29:24.934 --> 29:26.765
Ms. Boatman,
do you have any idea

29:26.765 --> 29:28.557
why Tristan would
steal these credit cards?

29:28.557 --> 29:29.809
I don't.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.650
Do you think his history
of abuse perhaps

29:31.650 --> 29:32.691
had something to do with it?

29:32.691 --> 29:34.353
I wouldn't know.

29:34.353 --> 29:35.484
Are you sure?

29:35.484 --> 29:38.237
I guess I don't really
understand the question.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.318
Okay.

29:39.318 --> 29:42.201
Maybe you can
answer this question.

29:42.201 --> 29:43.242
Are you pregnant?

29:43.242 --> 29:44.954
I'm sorry?

29:44.954 --> 29:48.707
Right now sitting on that stand,
are you pregnant?

29:48.707 --> 29:50.249
What is she doing?

29:50.249 --> 29:52.832
Ms. Winterbottom, how is
this relevant to the case?

29:52.832 --> 29:55.334
Relevance will become clear
once Ms. Boatman here

29:55.334 --> 29:57.877
admits to the identity
of her unborn child's father.

29:57.877 --> 29:59.468
Objection. Counsel's
giving her own testimony.

29:59.468 --> 30:01.300
Is Tristan the father
of the baby, Susan?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.421
Please stop her.

30:02.421 --> 30:04.263
Did Tristan tell you this?

30:04.263 --> 30:05.764
He's lying.

30:05.764 --> 30:09.598
Is he lying?
Or are you?

30:09.598 --> 30:11.310
Answer me.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.934
Ms. Boatman, I should caution
you that you may plead the fifth

30:14.934 --> 30:16.775
in order to avoid
incriminating yourself.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.108
Incriminate myself
from what?

30:19.108 --> 30:21.650
You raped my client,
Susan.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.822
You knew he was
vulnerable and trustworthy,

30:23.822 --> 30:25.404
so you targeted him.

30:25.404 --> 30:27.246
Don't look at him.

30:27.246 --> 30:29.078
He's suffered enough
under your care,

30:29.078 --> 30:31.120
and now you're going
to fix that by admitting

30:31.120 --> 30:32.912
what you did --
how you raped this boy...

30:32.912 --> 30:34.874
Please tell her to stop.
I'm begging you.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.335
...manipulated him
to the point that he

30:36.335 --> 30:38.507
stole money
for your unborn child.

30:40.049 --> 30:42.051
Tell the court
the truth, Susan!

30:46.225 --> 30:48.017
I plead the fifth.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.772
The prosecution's dropping
the charges against you.

30:53.772 --> 30:55.394
They understand now
that you were

30:55.394 --> 30:56.815
acting on behalf
of an adult.

30:56.815 --> 30:58.857
But Susan
will go to jail?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.900
Well, she deserves
more than jail

31:00.900 --> 31:02.902
for what she did to you,
Tristan.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.653
Someday, you're going to
understand --

31:04.653 --> 31:06.445
You don't understand!

31:06.445 --> 31:08.077
This isn't about her!

31:08.077 --> 31:10.329
It's about the baby!

31:10.329 --> 31:12.121
She's gonna have it in jail,
and then what?

31:12.121 --> 31:14.253
Who's gonna take care of it?
No one.

31:14.253 --> 31:16.415
It's gonna grow up just
like me -- with no family.

31:19.048 --> 31:21.300
You're both
horrible people.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.564
Blame me.

31:35.564 --> 31:38.317
None of this is on you.

31:38.317 --> 31:41.020
No, I -- I don't blame you.

31:45.364 --> 31:48.617
I'm proud of you.

31:48.617 --> 31:50.829
He needed to see
the person she really is.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.627
Thank you so much
for agreeing to meet with me.

31:58.627 --> 32:01.040
I just wanted to go on record
as soon as possible.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.252
We understand.

32:03.252 --> 32:05.804
As long as you know
any statement you make here

32:05.804 --> 32:08.507
can be used as evidence at
the formal disciplinary hearing.

32:08.507 --> 32:09.848
I do.

32:12.851 --> 32:14.813
When you're ready.

32:14.813 --> 32:17.016
My name is Annalise Keating,
and I've been a member

32:17.016 --> 32:20.439
of the Pennsylvania Bar
for 18 years.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.322
In light of the video
of me assaulting my client,

32:23.322 --> 32:26.365
I felt that it was important
for me to open up

32:26.365 --> 32:28.777
about a personal struggle
I've recently been facing.

32:31.830 --> 32:34.333
I'm an alcoholic.

32:37.496 --> 32:43.002
I'm not here to make excuses
or to ask for forgiveness.

32:43.002 --> 32:47.136
You don't know how long I've
been wanting this to happen.

32:47.136 --> 32:49.088
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

32:49.088 --> 32:50.929
Show me.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.094
It's no surprise that
I've had many struggles

32:55.094 --> 32:58.397
in my personal life of late.

32:58.397 --> 33:02.271
My husband's death,
the shooting, the fliers.

33:02.271 --> 33:05.314
My professional reputation
has suffered.

33:05.314 --> 33:09.738
I've begun to self-medicate
with alcohol as a result.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.611
Connor.

33:12.611 --> 33:14.573
Sorry, there are a lot
of guys in this building.

33:14.573 --> 33:17.286
Half of whom you'll probably
bang by the end of the night.

33:19.878 --> 33:21.290
Shh.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.332
Surprise!

33:23.332 --> 33:25.254
Oh, my God!

33:25.254 --> 33:27.586
Happy birthday!

33:27.586 --> 33:28.627
Getting his dance on.

33:28.627 --> 33:31.050
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-Wow. That was...

33:31.050 --> 33:32.721
Thank you very much.

33:32.721 --> 33:34.303
Aww.

33:37.226 --> 33:40.229
I'm ashamed
and embarrassed by my behavior.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.311
It does not reflect
the person that I am

33:42.311 --> 33:44.853
either as a lawyer or woman.

33:44.853 --> 33:49.448
As such, I agreed to enter
an approved treatment program

33:49.448 --> 33:53.992
if it will allow me
to get my license reinstated.

33:53.992 --> 33:57.206
It's perfect. Alcoholism
is a medical condition.

33:57.206 --> 33:58.917
You're under a protected class.
You're a genius.

33:58.917 --> 34:01.039
Oh, it was Nate's idea.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.251
Well, then
Nate's a genius.

34:02.251 --> 34:04.002
Yeah.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.546
Thank you.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.088
For what?

34:09.088 --> 34:11.720
For not judging me.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.552
I'd never judge you.

34:16.675 --> 34:18.887
You're the only one.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.758
I can't.

34:49.758 --> 34:51.880
I'm sorry.

35:02.641 --> 35:04.143
I met someone.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.065
Vanessa.

35:07.065 --> 35:11.400
She's the one I was talking to
on the phone the other night.

35:11.400 --> 35:17.446
We met a few months ago
during my case in California.

35:17.446 --> 35:20.289
Things have been moving
faster than I expected.

35:20.289 --> 35:23.832
I wasn't sure if
it was gonna be anything real,

35:23.832 --> 35:27.005
and, you know, with everything
that's going on with you,

35:27.005 --> 35:28.667
it just...

35:31.300 --> 35:33.212
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.346
What were
you talking about?

35:37.346 --> 35:39.968
On the phone,
you seemed upset.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.934
She wants me
to move to San Francisco.

35:48.817 --> 35:52.441
Does she love you?

35:52.441 --> 35:54.072
Yes.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.035
You love her?

36:02.080 --> 36:03.782
I do.

36:06.955 --> 36:08.917
You should go.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.048
Annalise.

36:10.048 --> 36:12.090
No. Oh, no.

36:12.090 --> 36:14.253
You deserve it
more than anyone.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.886
Go.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.261
Let yourself be loved.

36:35.654 --> 36:36.905
You are not
what I was expecting.

36:36.905 --> 36:39.988
- What does that mean?
- Meggy!

36:39.988 --> 36:40.949
I mean,
that name is just --

36:40.949 --> 36:44.202
You were expecting me to be
an annoying white girl.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.124
It's cool. I've been dealing
with that my entire life.

36:46.124 --> 36:48.497
Right? Like, what were
your parents thinking?

36:48.497 --> 36:50.829
All right, yeah,
let's burn some of that

36:50.829 --> 36:52.631
Henny off
on the dance floor. Okay.

36:52.631 --> 36:53.792
Like, was she really...

36:53.792 --> 36:55.043
You know what,
come on, you too.

36:55.043 --> 36:57.005
Oh, no thanks.

36:57.005 --> 36:58.887
Hey. I threw you
this stupid party.

36:58.887 --> 37:00.509
The very least you can do

37:00.509 --> 37:03.892
is come over here
and dance with me for one song.

37:03.892 --> 37:05.143
-Really?
-Yes.

37:05.143 --> 37:08.847
♪ Walking backwards inside out ♪

37:08.847 --> 37:12.901
♪ Slipping up,
and I can't fall down ♪

37:12.901 --> 37:16.315

37:16.315 --> 37:19.948
Hey, um, are you
hooking up with Simon?

37:19.948 --> 37:21.410
I don't care if you are.
I just --

37:21.410 --> 37:24.283
No. I'm not
hooking up with anyone.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.455
That's just you and the entire
city of Philadelphia.

37:26.455 --> 37:28.627
Okay, I'm confused.

37:28.627 --> 37:29.868
You're on Humpr, too.

37:29.868 --> 37:31.460
Michaela's on my Humpr.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.501
So, then you're not
mad at me?

37:32.501 --> 37:34.082
It's not that simple.

37:34.082 --> 37:35.674
Because I'm willing
to stop sleeping around

37:35.674 --> 37:36.875
if you want
to get back together.

37:36.875 --> 37:38.086
Is that it?

37:38.086 --> 37:39.878
Changed your mind?

37:39.878 --> 37:42.090
Great.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.383
Then we can both
screw our brains out.

37:44.383 --> 37:46.305
It's not as easy for me
to hook up as it is for you.

37:46.305 --> 37:47.646
Oh, my God, you need
to get over this whole

37:47.646 --> 37:49.348
low self-esteem thing.

37:49.348 --> 37:51.690
I mean, you're --
you're hot, funny,

37:51.690 --> 37:53.812
your penis
is practically perfect.

37:53.812 --> 37:55.484
None of that matters
if you're positive.

37:57.896 --> 37:58.987
You know
what you're gonna say.

37:58.987 --> 38:00.278
There's condoms and prep

38:00.278 --> 38:01.950
and I shouldn't
let it bother me,

38:01.950 --> 38:06.955
but it's still
a deal breaker for most guys.

38:06.955 --> 38:09.167
Stupid guys.
Oh, yeah?

38:09.167 --> 38:11.540
So, if I told you I was positive
the first night we met,

38:11.540 --> 38:14.713
you still would've
gone home with me?

38:16.044 --> 38:19.007
Look, you hook up
as much as you want.

38:19.007 --> 38:22.681
Just maybe don't
rub it in my face.

38:22.681 --> 38:24.182
Yeah.

38:24.182 --> 38:26.134
I'll stop.

38:26.134 --> 38:27.976
I'm willing to rub
other things in your face

38:27.976 --> 38:30.228
any time you want, though.
Shut up.

38:30.228 --> 38:31.930
Oh, my God.

38:35.233 --> 38:37.436
I'm sorry.
No, it's...

38:37.436 --> 38:38.276
Sure.

38:38.276 --> 38:40.359
♪ I'm stepping out ♪

38:53.331 --> 38:55.544
I'm gonna need for you
to make a real food run --

38:55.544 --> 38:58.336
chips, dip,
anything with chocolate.

39:00.008 --> 39:02.220
What's wrong?

39:02.220 --> 39:03.922
My father's dead.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.768
I thought he was still at
the federal prison in Allentown.

39:09.768 --> 39:11.019
That's where he's been
since the trial.

39:12.731 --> 39:14.523
Maybe the computer will change
its mind the next time.

39:14.523 --> 39:17.275
Name's Kevin. I'm new.

39:17.275 --> 39:19.147
But I guess he was
having lung problems.

39:22.030 --> 39:25.444
-We really doing this?
-I hope so.

39:25.444 --> 39:27.446
Hurry.

39:27.446 --> 39:29.367
Just do it.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.950
So, they moved him
to a low-security prison

39:31.950 --> 39:33.662
with a hospital.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.997
Why they care about keeping
pedophiles alive is beyond me.

39:52.601 --> 39:54.513
Who are you?

39:54.513 --> 39:56.144
Frank.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.898
It's nice to finally
meet you, Bob.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.860
There's no need for that.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.732
Just relax.

40:03.732 --> 40:05.574
Take deep breaths.

40:07.826 --> 40:10.699
He listed me as
his next of kin,

40:10.699 --> 40:13.662
so the nurse called me
and asked me if I wanted

40:13.662 --> 40:16.625
to pick up my father's body.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.206
Where's the prison?

40:18.206 --> 40:20.589
Coalport.

40:20.589 --> 40:22.380
It's a few hours
from Pittsburgh.

40:24.593 --> 40:27.756
Hydrogen sulfide.

40:27.756 --> 40:30.929
It's gonna melt your lungs
from inside out,

40:30.929 --> 40:33.972
and it's gonna
hurt real bad.

40:33.972 --> 40:36.685
Like the worst pain
of your life.

40:36.685 --> 40:40.018
And still it won't make up
for what you did to her.

40:42.521 --> 40:44.192
Enjoy hell, Bob.

40:55.664 --> 40:59.127
I'm so sorry.

40:59.127 --> 41:01.419
For what?

41:01.419 --> 41:03.291
I lied.
My father found Frank.

41:05.043 --> 41:09.047
He's in Coalport, Bonnie.

41:09.047 --> 41:10.849
I know I should've told you,
but Frank called me

41:10.849 --> 41:12.721
when I was in Florida,
and he said Annalise

41:12.721 --> 41:14.723
was trying to kill him,
and I know he could be lying,

41:14.723 --> 41:16.264
but I didn't know whether
I should believe him.

41:20.398 --> 41:25.604
He killed your father,
