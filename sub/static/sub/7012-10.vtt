00:03.140 --> 00:05.660
So, what are you boys
doing tonight?

00:05.740 --> 00:09.260
Well, this evening, Miss Big Rhonda
returns from the dirt farms of Mississippi.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.420
I am off to the bus station...

00:11.500 --> 00:13.940
and she will melt
into my loving arms.

00:14.020 --> 00:17.500
Well, you better wear a raincoat,
'cause she ain't small.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.460
She is big, isn't she?

00:24.180 --> 00:27.260
Well, I'm taking
this chick up to the lake for some...

00:27.340 --> 00:30.220
you know, bird-watching.

00:30.260 --> 00:33.180
Ooh, bird-watching.

00:33.260 --> 00:37.740
I think me and Jackie are going
to go "bird-watching" too.

00:37.820 --> 00:40.540
It's cool, 'cause they don't know
what we're talking about.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.940
Think they cracked it, Kelso.

00:51.140 --> 00:55.020
Well, I guess it's just us Three Musketeers
tonight, huh?

00:55.100 --> 00:57.500
"All for one and one for all," right?

00:59.220 --> 01:02.060
<i>Well, um, actually...</i>

01:02.100 --> 01:05.500
your father and I were
gonna do some reading...

01:05.580 --> 01:07.860
upstairs...

01:07.940 --> 01:10.260
together.

01:10.340 --> 01:14.820
What your mom's trying to say is,
"Go away for 20 minutes."

01:16.180 --> 01:19.180
Forty-five minutes, Red.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.540
- Thirty.
- Thirty-five.

01:21.620 --> 01:25.340
Fine.
Get lost for 35 minutes.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.700
Fine. But you know what?
I got a little question for you.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.380
Why have kids if you ain't
gonna spend time with them?

01:31.460 --> 01:34.820
I suggest you use your 35 minutes
to think about that.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.660
He needs a new girlfriend.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.100
Come on, Kitty.
You're on the clock.

01:43.180 --> 01:47.500
Oh, you know what? Just turn off your clock.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.740
You can't turn off the clock!

01:52.260 --> 01:54.780
She doesn't understand the clock.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.440
Cocoa Puff!

02:34.680 --> 02:36.680
Mashed potato!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.520
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I wanted to see you...

02:40.600 --> 02:42.800
because I wanted
to ask you something.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.880
- Will you go out with me this Saturday?
- Oh, my God.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.120
Course I will!

02:47.160 --> 02:49.800
Can't...

02:49.880 --> 02:52.040
breathe.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.800
- It hurts.
- Ah, suck it up.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.360
Wow, strong girl.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.200
Crap-alula.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.600
Fez just asked me out.

03:14.680 --> 03:19.120
I'm so nervous, and I left
my asthma puffer in Mississippi.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.360
I've never been on a real date.
What am I gonna wear?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.880
Who cares?
You could be naked with a welding hat...

03:25.960 --> 03:27.840
and Fez'd still be all over you.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.440
Well, that sounds fun.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.320
But I want it to be special.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.240
- You know what? We'll help you get ready.
- Really?

03:40.320 --> 03:43.120
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that'll be great. I wanna look pretty.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.880
Pretty?

03:46.960 --> 03:51.360
Oh, sweetie, maybe you can
learn some jokes or something.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.240
Look, dropout, this coupon says
20 cents off the athlete's-foot cream.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.480
- So pay up!
- Is there, uh, a problem here?

03:59.560 --> 04:03.320
This sad little man
has fungussy feet but won't spend the 20...

04:03.400 --> 04:05.480
Stacy.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.280
Mr. Forman, his coupon expired.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.840
Oh, that's all right.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.920
Here's your 20 cents.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.480
Now, you come again, huh?

04:16.560 --> 04:19.399
- Mushroom foot.
- Stacy!

04:19.480 --> 04:21.640
I'm sorry, Mr. Forman.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.800
It's just that he's such a dumb-ass.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.480
I like you.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.600
Hey, you know who I like?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.880
Nixon?

04:40.960 --> 04:44.400
Stacy, that cute, new cashier at work.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.640
You should ask her out.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.760
Sorry, Dad. I don't like to
dip my pen in the company ink.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.800
Well, I don't like you being home
three Fridays in a row.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.440
Look, if you don't have
the guts to talk to her...

04:57.520 --> 04:59.360
- I'll pave the way.
- Hey.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.440
Listen, if anyone's
gonna talk to her...

05:01.520 --> 05:04.080
I'll talk to her.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.920
Well, then we know
no one's gonna talk to her.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.920
Hey, I might.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.480
You...

05:14.560 --> 05:16.920
You still like girls, don't you, Son?

05:18.760 --> 05:21.520
No, Dad, they're yucky.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.000
Oh, my God.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.200
I know. She is seriously hot.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.080
No, not her. This KISS alarm clock.
Check it out.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.880
Wake up.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.880
Yeah, this I like.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.120
Forman, you have a responsibility
to all of us...

05:52.200 --> 05:54.760
to find out what's
underneath that smock.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.040
I bet it's boobs.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.400
So, spying on her, huh?

06:01.480 --> 06:04.000
Well, that's mature.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.520
Why don't you just
pull her hair and run?

06:06.600 --> 06:10.640
- Yes, let's do that.
- All right. All right, all right.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.560
All right.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.520
All right.
I'm gonna go do this.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.080
- Yeah, all right. I can't do this.
- Oh, geez.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.480
- I'll go talk to her.
- No!

06:22.520 --> 06:25.200
What? Now you're gonna
start listening to me?

06:25.240 --> 06:27.920
Go!
Grease the wheels, pal.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.760
Thanks for doing this.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.720
I know you guys'll
make me pretty and stuff.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.920
Rhonda, it's no problem.
We'll just help you pick some nice clothes...

06:40.000 --> 06:42.440
clean clothes... and...

06:42.520 --> 06:44.400
maybe do your hair...

06:44.480 --> 06:46.880
clean hair.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.720
Okay,
the beauty ambulance has arrived!

06:51.800 --> 06:54.520
So, first things first.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.560
Let's get rid of those shoulder pads.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.400
What shoulder pads?

07:03.160 --> 07:05.240
Okay.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.880
So, Stacy,
my son Eric is about your age.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.000
And he's a real nice guy...

07:11.080 --> 07:13.360
skinny but nice.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.280
And I was thinking...

07:15.320 --> 07:17.200
the two of you should go out.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.440
What do you say?

07:21.320 --> 07:24.360
Well, I kinda like someone else.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.720
Oh!

07:32.760 --> 07:35.160
Oh.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.800
Oh...

07:37.880 --> 07:39.800
no.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.880
Hey.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.720
- So, did she like me?
- Who?

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
- Stacy.
- Who's Stacy?

07:52.880 --> 07:55.840
- She's not interested.
- She's not interested?

07:55.920 --> 07:58.800
How can she not be interested?
Who is she?

07:58.880 --> 08:03.320
See? I knew I shouldn't have let you talk
to her. Great. Now she thinks I'm a freak.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.400
Oh, she doesn't think you're a freak.
Does she?

08:07.480 --> 08:10.000
Yes. Yes, she does.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.880
- You better stay away from her.
- Well, your father's right.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.000
If anyone's a freak, she is.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.440
Did Stacy actually
use the word "freak"?

08:19.520 --> 08:22.800
Why don't you just let it go?

08:22.880 --> 08:25.000
Maybe the reason girls
don't like you...

08:25.080 --> 08:28.600
is because you
just don't let things go!

08:29.760 --> 08:33.000
Stacy was saying just that thing today.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.679
I'm gonna go take a bath.

08:42.559 --> 08:45.640
Well, now, who is this Stacy
who doesn't like my son?

08:45.720 --> 08:49.240
I have half a mind to call her mother.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.520
I tried to set Eric up
with this pretty girl at wor...

08:52.600 --> 08:55.440
Well... not pretty.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.720
Decent.
Less ugly than most.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.720
Good enough for a young boy, but...

09:02.800 --> 09:05.480
no man would be interested.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.760
Red, what are you talking about?

09:07.840 --> 09:13.240
Why can't anyone in this family
just let things go?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.600
Red, you're blushing.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.120
Don't tell me she has a crush on <i>you.</i>

09:27.200 --> 09:29.960
Kitty, I don't wanna talk about it.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.080
Okay.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.520
So, do you...

09:34.600 --> 09:37.560
like her back?

09:48.800 --> 09:52.040
Hi. Stacy.
Hi. I'm Eric Forman.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.120
Look, I, uh, feel a little silly...

09:54.200 --> 09:56.920
about my dad asking you out for me.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.840
You probably thought I was, like...

09:58.880 --> 10:02.600
ugly or... slow or something.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.480
So, I just wanted to say hi...
you know, give you a chance to...

10:06.560 --> 10:10.160
you know, take a gander
at the goods, so to speak...

10:13.760 --> 10:17.560
and, uh, see if maybe, uh, tomorrow night
you wanted to have dinner?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.800
At your house?

10:21.360 --> 10:24.880
Will your dad be there?
'Cause I'll go if he's there.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.800
Okay.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.200
What, do you, like...

10:31.280 --> 10:34.560
Do you, like, like my dad?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.760
Oh, my God!
You like my dad?

10:39.840 --> 10:43.480
Do you know
if he's seeing anyone?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.440
Yeah.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.800
My mom.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.400
And they bought
furniture together, so...

10:50.480 --> 10:52.880
yeah, I think it's pretty serious.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.720
Ladies sit up straight.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.680
Candy! Ca...

11:10.760 --> 11:15.520
- Jackie, she doesn't have to sit like that.
- Yes, she does.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.520
- Stop doing that!
- <i>You</i> stop doing that!

11:23.600 --> 11:26.240
Hey! If I don't get a freakin' M&M,
I'm gonna start swingin'!

11:29.440 --> 11:31.400
You stay out of this.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.160
Jackie, try to be more sensitive.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.760
Donna, I am not gonna send her
on her date looking like Sasquatch.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.880
Huh?

11:43.960 --> 11:47.280
She said you're very pretty... "atch."

11:53.240 --> 11:55.720
Hey, guys.
I got news.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.000
Turns out Stacy doesn't even like me.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.440
- Yeah, we kind of expected that.
- Ooh.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.080
I thought you said you had news.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.400
Well, yeah.
Here it comes.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.120
- She likes Red.
- Ohh!

12:18.400 --> 12:21.560
- Oh, my God!
- Ohh.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.640
You're gonna have to leave town!

12:25.040 --> 12:28.800
- Why?
- Oh, 'cause we're gonna tell everyone!

12:34.080 --> 12:37.840
Tell me this.
How'd the 50-year-old guy get the girl?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.360
Look at me.
I'm an attractive man.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.480
Well, I got you.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.520
Technically, I got you.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.200
And then you blew it.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.680
Which means you didn't lose it,
because you never had it.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.960
See, there's your silver lining.

12:56.600 --> 13:00.480
Eric, you have a lot of good qualities.
I mean, you're funny. Like...

13:00.560 --> 13:02.840
Well, what just
happened to you is funny.

13:04.880 --> 13:10.160
Look, that chick likes Red
because he's a tough guy, a hard-ass.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.240
You? You're soft.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.440
How soft is he, Hyde?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.120
Softer than Liberace
at the Playboy Mansion.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.440
Yeah!

13:34.800 --> 13:37.560
'Cause he plays piano.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.480
Wait.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.600
Ohh!

13:45.680 --> 13:47.600
Burn!

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
You guys kill me.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.960
Look.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.200
How come Red is such a hard-ass,
and I am so...

14:04.280 --> 14:06.120
I mean...

14:06.200 --> 14:09.240
Okay, when a bear has a baby...

14:09.320 --> 14:11.680
it's a little bear, right?

14:11.760 --> 14:14.800
My dad's a bear, but I'm like...

14:14.880 --> 14:16.720
a duck.

14:22.360 --> 14:26.280
Eric, you were a bear
when you were born...

14:26.360 --> 14:29.520
but Red pounded you into
the duck that we know and love.

14:31.040 --> 14:36.360
So, what are you saying?
It's... It's Red's fault?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.800
Yeah. But the good news is,
as a duck...

14:38.880 --> 14:41.480
you can move more easily
through the water.

14:46.480 --> 14:51.680
And now back to <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

14:53.760 --> 14:56.360
Is everything okay over there, Stacy?

14:56.440 --> 15:00.200
Come here, Mr. Forman.
I wanna show you something.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.120
Holy crap!

15:07.200 --> 15:09.360
You're a zombie!

15:09.440 --> 15:12.640
I... want... Red.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.400
Red!
How could you?

15:17.480 --> 15:20.120
She's a sexy zombie!

15:20.160 --> 15:22.240
She overpowered me!

15:22.320 --> 15:24.960
I knew I couldn't trust you,
you cheater!

15:25.040 --> 15:28.200
Kitty!

15:39.840 --> 15:42.160
What the hell was that?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.600
Oh, Kitty.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.560
Oh, I need to talk to you.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.800
I just wanna say...

15:50.880 --> 15:53.880
with regard to this Stacy thing...

15:53.960 --> 15:56.680
Look.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.920
I'm bound to attract
a certain amount of attention.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.760
I can't help that.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.760
- But I would never...
- Oh, Red.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.880
You wouldn't stray.
You've got too much character.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.600
And who could blame her
for being interested?

16:14.680 --> 16:17.000
You're certainly interesting to me.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.760
Really?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.720
Do you, uh...

16:22.760 --> 16:24.640
have some spare time?

16:25.600 --> 16:28.160
Why?
Am I on the clock?

16:32.600 --> 16:36.000
I'm thinking 45 minutes.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.400
Ohh.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.040
The scenic route.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.560
I give you...

16:51.640 --> 16:54.240
the new Rhonda!

16:55.360 --> 16:57.640
First time in heels.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.600
So, where's Fez?

16:59.680 --> 17:03.320
Oh, he's nervous,
so he's in the "whoo-hoo."

17:05.079 --> 17:06.920
Have you been working
on her all night?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.319
She wouldn't even let me pee.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.240
I'd squash her like a bug
if I could catch her.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.040
But I do look pretty.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.319
Rhonda, is that you?

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
Boy, you look like a different girl.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.000
Do you like it?
Oh!

17:28.079 --> 17:31.160
Well, I thought
we would begin our evening...

17:31.200 --> 17:34.840
with a hot dog eating contest.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.160
Now, I realize
you're county champion...

17:37.240 --> 17:39.600
but I think I could
make it interesting.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.960
Sorry, Fez.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.080
I don't eat hot dogs
for glory <i>or</i> money anymore.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.960
It's not ladylike.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.880
- Says who?
- Says them.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.440
Them?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.960
What have you meddling whores
done to my Rhonda?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.400
- It was Jackie.
- It was Donna.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.440
Fez, she wouldn't let her pee or eat.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.320
- Donna called her Sasquatch.
- That was you too!

18:09.400 --> 18:11.480
Shut up!

18:11.560 --> 18:15.600
Shut up. I just want her back like
she was the first night I met her...

18:15.680 --> 18:18.520
on her knees, chugging beer
straight from the keg.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.680
But, Fez, I threw up twice that night.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.800
Yes...

18:25.880 --> 18:27.960
all over my heart.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.280
You big, lovable, clumsy galoot.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.280
And now, it is time that you two left.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.240
Good day.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.600
- But, Fez...
- He said, "Good day"!

19:00.560 --> 19:02.880
So, I'm a duck, huh?

19:08.520 --> 19:10.960
Yeah, we'll see who's a duck.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.680
Oh.
Hey, there you are.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.880
Yeah, we need to talk, man.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.880
I've been thinking out
this whole Stacy thing...

19:20.960 --> 19:23.320
It's your fault.
Yeah.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.480
You were too tough on me,
so now I'm soft.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.320
Oh, boo-hoo.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.960
You don't know
the first thing about tough.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.040
My old man was tough.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.640
When I was your age,
he shipped me off to the navy.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.680
He sure as hell wasn't
settin' me up with cute cashiers.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.640
Which I'm sorry I did.
Because now I've got this...

19:45.720 --> 19:48.360
creepy little girl giving me
google eyes all day...

19:48.440 --> 19:51.440
stickin' heart-shaped
notes in my locker.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.120
And on top of it all...

19:55.200 --> 19:59.360
I had to have a talk with
your mother about infidelity.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.200
That was unpleasant!

20:03.920 --> 20:06.040
So you just be grateful
that your dad...

20:06.120 --> 20:08.000
doesn't yell at you 24 hours a day!

20:08.080 --> 20:11.000
And don't give me that look,
because this isn't yelling!

20:11.080 --> 20:13.880
When I yell, you'll know it!

20:17.840 --> 20:19.800
Well, thanks.
Good talk.

20:21.340 --> 20:23.180
Man, look at all this stuff.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.580
I just realized how happy I am
not to be a girl.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.340
Well, that should have happened
at a much younger age.

20:38.660 --> 20:41.780
- How long was I out?
- Long enough.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.500
You guys wanna get a burger?

20:45.580 --> 20:48.060
Out in public?
Okay, I'll drive.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.980
I'll buy.
