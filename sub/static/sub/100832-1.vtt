[woman] This other guy
asked me why I'm on here.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.579
And I think he actually
got offended

00:12.613 --> 00:15.215
that I didn't ask him
the same question,

00:15.248 --> 00:17.483
which, as you know, I never do

00:18.418 --> 00:21.788
because it seems
like we live in a time

00:21.822 --> 00:25.491
where everyone's increasingly
becoming afraid

00:25.526 --> 00:27.594
of being themselves sexually.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.797
Nobody wants to be seen
putting themselves out there

00:30.831 --> 00:32.032
in the real world,

00:33.066 --> 00:36.269
because in real life,
you're deemed a pervert

00:36.302 --> 00:39.205
or even a predator for
wanting to see a girl naked.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.308
I think if a guy goes out
on a Tinder date with a girl

00:42.342 --> 00:45.245
and asked her to do something
that she's not willing to do,

00:45.278 --> 00:48.281
like, asked to see her naked,

00:48.314 --> 00:51.317
that's immediately
deemed harassment.

00:51.351 --> 00:52.452
But on cam,

00:53.319 --> 00:55.088
that's who you're
expected to be.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.664
in one form or the other,

is the most real

06:40.667 --> 06:42.636
of all the businesses we do.

it's not fantasy, it's reality.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.514
Theoretically, we're supposed
to imagine that cam is a person,

06:53.547 --> 06:55.782
that's a guy, that's them.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.885
You just need to act like
that camera is your boyfriend.

LiveJasmin right now
is world rank seventy‐three,

07:03.957 --> 07:06.893

hundred of the whole world.

somewhere in the hundred,

07:12.566 --> 07:13.834
hundred ten

we passed them.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.940
I think they're number ninety.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.543
SoundCloud is right

cam companies

07:33.754 --> 07:35.822

07:35.856 --> 07:38.925
So, you take ten hundred
million‐plus companies

Yeah, I mean, it's
only ten million a month.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.934
It's a business of slim margins.

07:47.968 --> 07:52.272
Because they're slim margins,
you have to do volume.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.642
We're all doing this
for the profit, you know.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.877
And it's a labor of love.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.812
But at the end of the day,
we want to make money doing it.

[Shirley] The cam business
is very unique for adults

08:47.928 --> 08:50.030
in the sense that broadcasters

08:50.063 --> 08:52.933
really do have full control
of what they do.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.301
You know, typically in the past

08:55.335 --> 08:58.038
where you would have
prepackaged content,

08:58.071 --> 08:59.940
you would have the director,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.875
you would have a casting agent,

09:01.908 --> 09:03.076
everyone shows up

09:05.812 --> 09:09.650
And her career was
kind of not in her control.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.818
The camming business
is very unique

09:11.852 --> 09:15.722

10:20.120 --> 10:23.023
It wasn't until a year ago
that I saw all these articles

10:23.056 --> 10:25.759
that were coming out
about camgirls

10:25.792 --> 10:29.129
and how much money
these girls were making.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.998
And it was just crazy to me.

10:32.032 --> 10:36.837
It was so insane that a girl
that's in Idaho or Minnesota,

10:36.870 --> 10:39.740
they're working from home
and they're making so much money

10:39.773 --> 10:42.042
than girls that are porn stars.

10:42.075 --> 10:47.848
So, I really decided that I was
going to dedicate myself

10:47.881 --> 10:48.949

10:48.982 --> 10:52.886

shitty minimum‐wage jobs.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.204
This guy I was seeing
at the time

11:11.237 --> 11:14.174
asked me if I wanted
to be a camgirl

11:14.207 --> 11:16.176
and I was honestly,
"What the fuck is that."

11:16.209 --> 11:18.444
He told me, and I was like,
"Yeah, what the hell,

11:18.478 --> 11:20.981
I love my body, I want
to show it off for money."

11:21.748 --> 11:24.751

and I became a camgirl.

do not know I cam.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.309
But I couldn't cam at my house

12:23.343 --> 12:24.978
because I still lived
at home with my parents.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.513
Anytime I wasn't working,

12:26.547 --> 12:28.214
I would just put
my uniform on and say,

12:28.248 --> 12:29.983
"Hey, mom, going to work. Bye."

12:30.016 --> 12:31.351
I'd really go to my friend's
house to go cam.

I was still new.

I just decided to jump all in.

You're like go big
or go home, you know.

was three months old

14:04.377 --> 14:05.378

14:06.580 --> 14:09.015
I basically get to be a
stay‐at‐home mom during the day

14:09.049 --> 14:11.384
and then after I put my daughter
to bed, I get to go to work.

14:11.417 --> 14:14.287

two to four hours

14:15.055 --> 14:16.957
and make a pretty good check
and I get to go to sleep.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.158
Then I get to wake up
and do it all over again.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.061

14:46.419 --> 14:48.989
I discovered camming when
I was sixteen or seventeen.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.124
I saw webcam girls,

14:51.157 --> 14:53.393
the traditional
Romanian camgirls

14:53.426 --> 14:55.261
sitting in a little studio

14:55.295 --> 14:57.297
and I was fascinated.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.432
As soon as I turned
eighteen, I signed up

14:59.465 --> 15:03.436
and broadcasted from the privacy
in my closet with a hairbrush.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.906
So, that's how I found
out about it first.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.209
When I merged
with the studio owner,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.978
my manager helped me
build a following

15:12.012 --> 15:14.080
and get started on social media.

15:14.114 --> 15:17.150
And then it just kind
of snowballed into what I am now

15:17.183 --> 15:19.419

followers on Twitter

15:19.452 --> 15:21.487

15:23.123 --> 15:26.026
[Devious] I wake up at 6:00 a. m.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.161
That's when I am already online.

15:28.194 --> 15:32.365

7:00, 8:00, 9:00, 10:00 p. m.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.701
After that, I go
to the gym, I go home,

15:34.735 --> 15:37.003
I shower, I take a sleep.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.404
And, again, the next day
the same thing.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.242

15:42.275 --> 15:44.110

different than they know.

38:33.747 --> 38:36.750
[interviewer] What would be
the ideal time to do camming?

38:38.151 --> 38:41.688
Ideal time to get on cam
would be at noon.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.659
All right, let's do this.

38:48.795 --> 38:49.963
[interviewer] Here we go.

38:49.996 --> 38:53.433
<i>For my cam show, which is</i>
<i>a fifteen‐minute long show,</i>

38:53.466 --> 38:56.102
I set it for thirty‐five
hundred tokens

38:56.136 --> 38:59.906
and the minimum buy‐in to
see a fifteen‐minute show

38:59.940 --> 39:01.742
is fifty tokens.

39:01.775 --> 39:04.144
So, if you don't pay
the fifty tokens,

39:04.177 --> 39:05.879
you are not going
to see the show.

39:08.549 --> 39:11.451
[Vanessa] Sometimes people are
trying to bargain with me.

39:11.484 --> 39:13.554
"I won't give you ten,
what about why five?"

39:13.587 --> 39:15.589
It's like it's not a bargain.

39:15.622 --> 39:17.891
You're not going
to negotiate my rates,

39:17.924 --> 39:19.893

you're going to pay for it.

People, are you kidding me?
it's like five cents per token.

39:22.863 --> 39:26.132
It's not even
that much, you know.

39:26.166 --> 39:28.569
And it's annoying.

39:28.602 --> 39:29.636
So, you have to pay.

39:29.670 --> 39:32.438
<i>Only the people that pay</i>
<i>gets to see the show</i>

39:32.472 --> 39:35.175
which is great because
it makes everyone happier,

39:35.208 --> 39:37.611
it makes me happier

39:37.644 --> 39:40.947

seeing my show for free.

it's hurt the industry so much.

39:55.662 --> 39:57.864

transparent about camming.

I was a graphic designer

Hi!

1:07:53.473 --> 1:07:55.576
‐How are you?
‐Good, how are you?

1:07:55.609 --> 1:07:57.177
Wow!

1:07:57.210 --> 1:07:59.412
You look absolutely gorgeous.

1:07:59.445 --> 1:08:02.616
We want to let everyone
know that it's real. It's true.

1:08:02.649 --> 1:08:04.851
Yeah, real life, real time,
real sex. It's awesome.

1:08:04.885 --> 1:08:06.553
‐[interviewer] You are
real couple.
‐Yes.

1:08:06.587 --> 1:08:08.589
‐Oh yeah.
‐We really love each other.

1:08:08.622 --> 1:08:10.256
[Jack] Porn fans are
looking to get off,

1:08:10.290 --> 1:08:12.258
jerk‐off, go about their day.

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:18.298
Cam guys are looking for
like an online relationship.

1:08:18.331 --> 1:08:20.667
‐I've been looking forward
for this moment.
‐Yes!

1:08:20.701 --> 1:08:24.337
Totally. How have you been?
When did you get here?

1:08:24.370 --> 1:08:26.607
‐I know.
‐No, when did you get here?

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:28.474
‐Just like an hour ago.
‐Okay.

1:08:28.509 --> 1:08:30.476
I was actually so
nervous meeting you.

1:08:30.511 --> 1:08:35.916
I know of three marriages
that came off of Chaturbate.

1:08:35.949 --> 1:08:38.451
It's cute stories
like that that we love.

1:08:38.484 --> 1:08:40.554
You know, things
like that do happen.

1:08:41.622 --> 1:08:44.424
The cam companies are
the main sponsors of the event.

1:08:45.258 --> 1:08:48.161
They're doing that because
that's where the fans are,
that's where the money is.

1:08:48.194 --> 1:08:49.896
This show is about cam.

1:08:49.930 --> 1:08:51.397
It's about live cams.

1:08:51.431 --> 1:08:53.199
It's about live adult content.

1:08:53.233 --> 1:08:55.602
This is the future
and the future is now.

1:08:57.270 --> 1:08:59.940
[Ariana] Camming means
to be empowered.

1:08:59.973 --> 1:09:03.209
It means to be in control.

1:09:03.243 --> 1:09:05.912
It means to be
somewhat of a therapist.

1:09:05.946 --> 1:09:09.282
It means to be a customer
service superstar.

1:09:09.315 --> 1:09:11.652
It used to blow my mind

1:09:11.685 --> 1:09:16.256
that somebody would
get on cam with her

1:09:16.289 --> 1:09:17.591
for four hours to talk with her.

1:09:17.624 --> 1:09:19.492
Used to blow my mind.

1:09:19.526 --> 1:09:21.695
I think society
has gone to a place

1:09:21.728 --> 1:09:25.566
where we all feel
very disconnected...

1:09:26.432 --> 1:09:27.734
Lonely.

1:09:27.768 --> 1:09:30.604
And I think that's a big reason

1:09:30.637 --> 1:09:34.675
why the webcam world
is getting bigger and bigger.

1:09:35.509 --> 1:09:37.711
And I think you're going to
see more of that happening.

1:09:38.612 --> 1:09:40.346
[Eric] I have no idea
where the cam business

1:09:40.380 --> 1:09:41.515
is going to take us.

1:09:41.548 --> 1:09:43.416
<i>I think it'll be a lot</i>
<i>different than people expect</i>

1:09:43.449 --> 1:09:46.720

1:09:56.997 --> 1:09:58.765
[Mugar] They are not going
there to see naked women.

1:09:58.799 --> 1:10:01.234
That's the most fake thing
that people believe

1:10:01.267 --> 1:10:01.802
outside the industry.

1:10:03.036 --> 1:10:05.606
Members are entering a live
chat site to see naked women.

1:10:05.639 --> 1:10:08.441
No. There are tons
of tubes for that.

1:10:08.474 --> 1:10:10.577
They go there because
they need joy in their life.

1:10:11.344 --> 1:10:13.780
They need somebody that
will bring them happiness.

1:10:14.548 --> 1:10:16.617
And this is a live cam model.
They deliver happiness.

1:10:17.483 --> 1:10:20.654
And they need all our respect
and admiration for that.

1:10:21.421 --> 1:10:24.625
You know, people have
this misconception

1:10:24.658 --> 1:10:27.594
that cam is all about sex.

1:10:27.628 --> 1:10:30.263
And it is most of the time.

1:10:30.296 --> 1:10:33.466
But there's also, you know,
your core group of people

1:10:33.499 --> 1:10:37.003
that you have that you webcam
every single day with

1:10:37.037 --> 1:10:39.540
and you've become friends
with these people

1:10:39.573 --> 1:10:43.309
and you talk to them about
what's going on in the world.

1:10:44.811 --> 1:10:47.614
[Alex] I always teach
the girls to be themselves,

1:10:47.648 --> 1:10:48.749
to be original.

1:10:48.782 --> 1:10:51.585
Because looking at any camsite,

1:10:51.618 --> 1:10:54.555
most of models
are trying to copy

1:10:55.556 --> 1:10:58.491
other models that they
think they are better.

1:10:58.525 --> 1:10:59.826
Maybe they are.

1:10:59.860 --> 1:11:02.729
<i>But in most cases,</i>
<i>maybe they are not</i>
<i>better than them.</i>

1:11:02.763 --> 1:11:05.632
But when you are trying
to replicate something

1:11:05.666 --> 1:11:07.033
to fake something,

1:11:07.067 --> 1:11:09.636
it could not be the best option.

1:11:09.670 --> 1:11:11.605
Real girls wear real emotion.

1:11:11.638 --> 1:11:14.641
And I think live chat
in general is about that.

1:11:14.675 --> 1:11:16.442
Just be yourself.

1:11:16.476 --> 1:11:19.846
It's very a common advice,
but it really works.

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:23.817
If you're an interesting person,
you will grow in popularity.

1:11:26.086 --> 1:11:28.054

[Reka] Very amazing how you
can become a star in like hours.

1:11:53.479 --> 1:11:57.518
I like seeing them enjoying
and seeing themselves as stars.

1:11:57.551 --> 1:12:00.086
So, I think that's the best.

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:01.588
For me, this is what it means.

1:12:38.158 --> 1:12:40.493
[ChronicLove] This site
is called Chat or Bathe.

1:12:40.527 --> 1:12:43.597
So, you have the option
to chat or bathe.

1:12:43.630 --> 1:12:45.832
And I know most people
will have the idea,

1:12:45.866 --> 1:12:47.701
they're horny,
they want to go there.

1:12:47.734 --> 1:12:50.136
But then after they've
enjoyed themselves,

1:12:50.170 --> 1:12:53.373
they want to maybe stick
around and be entertained.

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:09.956
Even the fact that we can
cook freaks people out.

1:13:09.990 --> 1:13:11.692
‐Yeah.
‐"What, they cook'"

1:13:11.725 --> 1:13:13.794

‐Holy shit.

‐Yeah. Actually that's true.
‐It's little things like that.

that connection.

or just any kind
of business achievement,

1:13:34.881 --> 1:13:36.850
the first thing you want
to do is tell mom and dad

1:13:36.883 --> 1:13:37.884
because that's incredible.

1:13:38.652 --> 1:13:39.620
