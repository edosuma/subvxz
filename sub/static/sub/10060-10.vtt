00:17.417 --> 00:18.875
ELIJAH: So what, you had a
sex dream about Ray.

00:18.875 --> 00:21.375
You've had actual sex with Ray
which is way worse.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.708
We've been outpaced.
It's very bleak.

00:23.708 --> 00:25.000
What do you think
I was doing in Japan?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.750
I mean other than learning
origami and eating candy

00:26.750 --> 00:29.083
that tastes like other candy.
I do marketing.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.291
At least let me
have a crack at that.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.750
-Are you with Adam?
-Yeah.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.750
She knows. She fully knows.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.291
I can't really think about
Hannah right now.

00:36.291 --> 00:39.417
TALLY: You've had all these,
like, boyfriends, and moments.

00:39.417 --> 00:42.500
You've lived all this truth.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.333
Well, it didn't feel like very
much while it was happening.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.667
I'm looking for someone special.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.458
And I'm not that someone.

00:50.875 --> 00:51.959
MARNIE: I love you.

- Hannah.
- Hannah,
I saw you see us.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.250
I just started
my run, okay?

01:51.250 --> 01:52.333
That's not true.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.208
You were returning
here to your home.

01:54.208 --> 01:57.625
What I do
is I run up and down
the block multiple times

01:57.625 --> 01:59.000
till I feel like
I'm gonna barf.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.917
I measured it out.
It's basically a mile.

02:00.917 --> 02:02.542
What are you doing here?

02:02.542 --> 02:04.708
Hannah,
you haven't returned
any of our phone calls.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.000
Not one.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.875
Honey, I called you
23 times the other day.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.375
Yeah, does that
not strike you
as a bit psycho?

02:10.375 --> 02:13.417
We just want to spend
some time with you,
honey, okay?

02:13.417 --> 02:15.625
As a normal family unit.

02:15.625 --> 02:17.125
Well, I would say
"normal family unit"

02:17.125 --> 02:19.208
kind of went out the window
when one of you became gay

02:19.208 --> 02:21.166
and the other started
dressing like Pat Benatar.

02:22.708 --> 02:24.250
Please be open
to us, Hannah.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.083
Be open to the time
we want to spend with you.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.500
I have to finish
my run.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.250
- ( scoffs ) Bullshit.
- ( snickers )

02:30.250 --> 02:32.208
No, Mom, you don't know.
I've been running a lot.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.917
I'm not sure
if you've heard
of "endor-phins,"

02:33.917 --> 02:35.667
but they've been
really helping me.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.417
Helping me
to deal with you.

02:37.417 --> 02:39.291
( sighs )

02:39.291 --> 02:40.875
Endorphins.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.291
Comes on the...

02:43.291 --> 02:46.166
( music playing )

02:48.750 --> 02:51.750
I'm sorry I didn't come.
I was really close.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.750
The good news
is I can only come when
I kind of hate someone.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.667
I'm working on that
with my online therapist.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.291
Well, I won't
stop trying.

03:01.542 --> 03:04.750
Ray, you have to support me
professionally, okay?

03:04.750 --> 03:08.333
I mean, as much
as it might cause damage
to us romantically,

03:08.333 --> 03:11.083
Desi and I are opening
for the Lumineers
in Boston.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.083
Ray:
That's great.
That sounds amazing.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.166
I mean,
I thought Lumineers
were teeth caps,

03:15.166 --> 03:16.792
but clearly, based
on your enthusiasm,

03:16.792 --> 03:19.417
they must nurture
some important significance

03:19.417 --> 03:21.291
in the alternative rock
universe.

03:21.291 --> 03:24.291
Except fucking Tandace
is coming on every stop
of the tour.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.041
And I'm telling you,
she is deeply crazy.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.041
No one is that calm.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.125
Right, she is calm.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.083
Come with me.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.458
- On tour?
- Yes, totally.

03:38.458 --> 03:41.166
I mean, I will require
a lot of emotional support

03:41.166 --> 03:43.000
and some minor
logistical support.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.500
You know, simple stuff,
like making sure I have
coconut water

03:45.500 --> 03:47.417
and Smartwater
and sort my vitamins

03:47.417 --> 03:49.834
and figure out
how much zinc to take,
all that stuff.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.417
But I know you don't
want to be without me.

03:52.417 --> 03:54.750
- ( laughs )
- I know that.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.208
- Um...
- Come on, please?

03:57.208 --> 03:59.291
- Please?
- You're so cute
when you beg.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.250
- Please?
- ( chuckles )
I'm a human.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.959
I'm just a mortal man.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.542
- Yeah, I'd love to come.
That sounds great.
- Yeah?

04:05.542 --> 04:07.125
- Yeah, why not?
- What about work?

04:07.125 --> 04:08.750
What about work?
It'll be fine.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.542
Kippy can run
the community board meetings
for a little while

04:10.542 --> 04:13.917
and Shosh has
the coffee shop
on lockdown.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.834
- Are you still peeing?
- Huh? Yeah.

04:15.834 --> 04:18.541
I mean, I just want
to make sure I get
every last drop out.

04:18.541 --> 04:21.500
You are not giving me
a UTI before a tour.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.792
( music playing )

04:29.250 --> 04:30.500
Amazing work, Megan.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.417
Keep it moving,
but also, like,
keep it connected.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.875
Hermie, Hermie, hi.
Just a minute.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.959
Okay, I have some news
that is going to rock

04:37.959 --> 04:39.542
your Mephistos
right off your socks.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.542
"The New York Times"
Thursday style section

04:41.542 --> 04:42.917
wants to come here
and do a piece on us
next week.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.500
They love
the hipster-hate angle.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.166
- Uh...
- They want to do
a whole profile

04:46.166 --> 04:47.542
on our transformation,
so I bought a few shirts

04:47.542 --> 04:49.291
and I put them
in your office
and I hung them

04:49.291 --> 04:51.000
- in descending order
of preference.
- Shoshanna.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.542
- Now, the turquoise is my--
- Shoshanna!

04:52.542 --> 04:54.208
- Yes?
- I know I told you
to lean in.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.834
But you've gone too far.

04:55.834 --> 04:58.000
Now I want you
to lean out.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.542
Oh, my God,
are you firing me?

04:59.542 --> 05:01.208
No, no.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.959
We've made
more money this week
than the past five months.

05:03.959 --> 05:06.083
It's just you're
a very intense person.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.542
You've got
a powerful energy
and it's too much.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.041
I need you to take it
down a notch.

05:10.041 --> 05:12.417
- I-- oh, no.
- ( door opens )

05:12.417 --> 05:15.208
Hi, sir.
Bye, sir.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.125
Your kind are not
welcome here.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.375
Read the sign.
Out.

05:19.375 --> 05:22.667
Hermie, Hermie,
we cannot actually
turn people away.

05:22.667 --> 05:25.625
That's discrimination.
We just have to, like,
you know,

05:25.625 --> 05:27.500
glare at them and make them
super uncomfortable

05:27.500 --> 05:30.000
and bully them
until they leave
of their own volition.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.208
Listen to me, muffin.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.041
From now on,
anybody who walks
through that door

05:34.041 --> 05:35.792
with a bun on top
of their head

05:35.792 --> 05:37.375
or tattoos that were
not acquired

05:37.375 --> 05:39.667
during a naval adventure
on the South Pacific,

05:39.667 --> 05:43.667
we treat 'em like a hippie
at Disneyland in '68.

05:43.667 --> 05:46.125
This is a haven
for normal people--

05:46.125 --> 05:48.333
working men and ladies.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.417
Free refills,
everybody.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.250
This week only.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.208
We're taking back the night.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.250
You're either with me
or you're against me.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.041
I am so with you,
Hermie.

05:58.041 --> 06:01.875
Please save me
all of those magical quotes
for "The New York Times."

06:01.875 --> 06:05.500
All right, Sample,
let's eat.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.083
( toilet flushing )

06:07.083 --> 06:08.417
Okay, oi.

06:08.417 --> 06:11.500
Spoon is an airplane.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.125
And it's crashing
into your face.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.500
That's way too much
for one bite.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.291
- What do you mean?
- That's too much food.
She could choke.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.667
But she's not choking.

06:21.667 --> 06:24.083
She's just spitting it out
like a normal person.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.291
( Sample babbling )

06:33.375 --> 06:35.000
So, what, now you're
just gonna do it?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.500
- Here.
- Can I at least get
some fucking credit here?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.917
- Look what I got.
- You told me I sucked
with the baby

06:39.917 --> 06:41.667
and now I'm trying
to be better with the baby

06:41.667 --> 06:44.041
and now you're still telling me
I'm fucking up the baby.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.959
I watched two YouTube videos
about babies, Adam.

06:46.959 --> 06:49.792
- ( chuckles )
- That's a good girl.

06:49.792 --> 06:53.125
If you want someone
who's so good with babies,
why don't you call Hannah?

06:53.125 --> 06:54.792
She loves babies.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.625
She's always trying
to accidentally French them.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.083
Why the fuck would you
mention Hannah right now?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.834
I'm sorry,
I can't mention her?

07:01.834 --> 07:03.333
Can't even have
thoughts about her?

07:03.333 --> 07:05.250
No, you can think it
all you want,

07:05.250 --> 07:07.208
but don't feel the need
to share it with me.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.959
( babbles )

07:09.959 --> 07:11.583
It's okay.

07:11.583 --> 07:14.333
I'm thinking
about her right now.

07:15.834 --> 07:18.792
Banana, you don't seem
like you're having fun
with us.

07:18.792 --> 07:21.166
I'm not.
You guys are
depressing.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.250
No, we're not.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.333
No, we're a little
depressing.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.625
Honey, is it
because we're trying
to make it work?

07:26.625 --> 07:27.917
Yes.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.542
Hannah, stop judging.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.166
You know what?

07:31.166 --> 07:32.834
I don't like being
judged either.

07:32.834 --> 07:35.333
That's why I had to end
my relationship with Fran,

07:35.333 --> 07:36.875
so I will stop judging you.

07:36.875 --> 07:40.708
If you get
better haircuts.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.333
If you want us to,
we'll get haircuts.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.625
- Tad: We will.
- Thank you.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.375
Now, I need everyone
to stop talking to me

07:47.375 --> 07:49.375
'cause I'm trying
to get in the zone
for The Moth tonight.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.625
Well, that's fun.
What's that?

07:51.625 --> 07:53.875
Oh, it's like an open-mic
storytelling contest

07:53.875 --> 07:55.875
that can lead
to NPR opportunities

07:55.875 --> 07:58.166
and be kind of
a doorway to Ira Glass.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.500
So, you're writing again?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.041
I don't know, but I have
something to say.

08:05.041 --> 08:06.375
What are you wearing?

08:06.375 --> 08:08.208
I would say just, like,
this with, like, a blazer

08:08.208 --> 08:09.750
and, like, a belt
with trinkets.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.708
- No.
- No.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.208
What if I add, like,
a chunky heel?

08:15.208 --> 08:18.125
- No. No.
- No. No.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.834
Let's go shopping.

08:19.834 --> 08:23.083
Oh, my God.
This stuff is so cute.

08:23.083 --> 08:26.500
Mom, I would wear this
on a date with Mark Ruffalo.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.083
I would wear this to lunch
with Graydon Carter.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.083
Yeah, it's very good
for our body type.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.417
We don't have
the same body type.

08:33.417 --> 08:35.582
Hey, which of your friends
are coming tonight?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.750
Oh, I don't know.
Not Jessa.

08:37.750 --> 08:41.542
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
That is such fucking bullshit.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.667
I just spend all my time
trying not to sink

08:43.667 --> 08:45.667
to their level,
which is really hard.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.708
When I saw them last,
I said, "Good day,
sirs and misses,"

08:48.708 --> 08:50.417
like I was
a fucking Newsy.

08:50.417 --> 08:51.959
Good for you.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.041
I had a friend
who stole my boyfriend once.

08:54.041 --> 08:57.750
Dale. He was such a hunk.
Captain of the debate team.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.125
And then Cadence,
this math major bitch,

09:00.125 --> 09:03.333
she started sleeping
with him when I went home
for Great-Aunt Bibs' funeral.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.166
Can you imagine?
I'm already mourning
Bibs and then this.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.083
- But you know what?
- What?

09:08.083 --> 09:10.291
Two years later,
she steps in front
of a car,

09:10.291 --> 09:12.041
freak accident,
and she's dead.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.875
Now, I'm not saying
that's gonna happen to Jessa,

09:13.875 --> 09:16.458
but I'm also saying
I hope it does,
for your sake.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.583
It freed me
from so much anger,

09:18.583 --> 09:20.583
anger that probably
would've killed me.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.500
And then Dale
wanted you again?

09:22.500 --> 09:23.750
I didn't even
think of that.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.583
I was just so happy
Cadence was dead.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.417
( knock on door )

09:34.417 --> 09:36.417
Elijah:
Hannah, open up
the door, okay?

09:36.417 --> 09:38.375
( knocks )
Hannah, I'm not
fucking around.

09:38.375 --> 09:41.125
I need to get in there
and wash my lower half,

09:41.125 --> 09:43.125
by which I mean my dick

09:43.125 --> 09:45.500
and my balls
and my--

09:45.500 --> 09:46.667
hey!

09:46.667 --> 09:47.500
Hey!

09:47.500 --> 09:48.834
- Come on in.
- Hi!

09:48.834 --> 09:50.750
- Hi.
- ( both groan )

09:50.750 --> 09:53.125
- What a nice surprise.
- Come on in.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.834
I thought I was gonna have
another morning alone,

09:54.834 --> 09:58.959
ever since
your dumb daughter
started running.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.667
- Yes.
- Yep, okay.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.500
- You all right, Elijah?
- Uh-huh.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
You sleep at all,
Elijah?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.917
Yeah, yeah, no,
I slept--

10:07.917 --> 10:09.708
yeah, I slept Wednesday.

10:09.708 --> 10:11.417
Well, it's Saturday now.

10:11.417 --> 10:13.208
- ( laughs ) Oh, well...
- It sure is Saturday.

10:13.208 --> 10:15.166
- ...Tad, Calendar Man.
- Yeah.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.792
I don't know, yeah.
I've just been having
a good time, you know?

10:17.792 --> 10:19.750
Just letting the chips fall
where they may, you know?

10:19.750 --> 10:21.708
Just having a good old time.
What about you?

10:21.708 --> 10:24.166
You here for
another gay-for-all?

10:24.166 --> 10:26.208
No, I'm here
with my wife.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.750
( laughing )

10:33.542 --> 10:35.542
Oh, Tad.

10:35.542 --> 10:38.375
That is the saddest thing
I have ever heard.

10:38.375 --> 10:40.834
Doing my best.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.208
Really?

10:43.208 --> 10:44.875
Well, maybe your best
isn't good enough.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.417
- Yeah.
- You know?

10:47.417 --> 10:51.166
Maybe your fuckin' best
isn't good enough, Tad.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.708
Yeah.

10:53.708 --> 10:55.708
I need your bosom.

10:55.708 --> 10:56.959
Okay.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.542
Oh, Tad, what
does it matter, anyway?

10:59.542 --> 11:01.875
You know, just a bunch
of fuckin' assholes out there

11:01.875 --> 11:04.708
just getting whatever they want
while the rest of us just rot.

11:04.708 --> 11:07.834
Look at me, I'm just
trying to live my life,
be a good person,

11:07.834 --> 11:10.333
and the rich
keep getting richer

11:10.333 --> 11:13.750
while I turn to dust
on Bleecker Street,
you know?

11:16.959 --> 11:20.333
Fuckin' Tad,
you know, I just
want to be happy.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.750
( sighs )

11:21.750 --> 11:23.834
Is that-- I mean,
I just want to be happy.

11:23.834 --> 11:27.667
I just want one day
where I just feel good.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.208
Of course,
of course
you do.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.208
I just feel like...

11:35.875 --> 11:38.208
I just feel
like giving up.

11:38.208 --> 11:40.417
Don't you?

11:40.417 --> 11:41.959
No.

11:41.959 --> 11:44.583
I feel like
I'm just starting.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.291
She ate once, shat twice,
slept for an hour.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.792
Can't thank you
enough, man.

11:51.792 --> 11:55.959
I mean, I was able
to get protein powder
and underpants,

11:55.959 --> 11:57.625
saw my friend Justin.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.291
You know, just to have,
like, a second to breathe

12:00.291 --> 12:03.291
was crucial.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.959
Hey, Samps.

12:04.959 --> 12:07.792
Hey, Samps, girl. Hi.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.041
Hey, look at me.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.417
I'm looking at you.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.834
No, no, no,
really look at me
in my face.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.041
Okay.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.875
( Sample fussing )

12:17.875 --> 12:19.500
Okay.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.917
You okay?

12:20.917 --> 12:23.708
- Here's Daddy!
- Oh, hi.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.792
Oh, I missed you.

12:25.792 --> 12:26.792
Hi.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.583
I missed you so much.

12:28.583 --> 12:31.625
We're gonna get this on you
and then we're gonna go.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.917
We're gonna get this
fuckin' thing...

12:33.917 --> 12:35.583
You know what?
I'll carry her.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.000
- I'll just carry you.
- Okay.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.959
I'd rather do that
anyway, all right?

12:38.959 --> 12:40.542
( gasps )
Here's your bag.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.500
Thank you again, man.
Really appreciate it.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.959
- You wanna say bye?
- Bye, bye, bye.

12:45.959 --> 12:47.959
Yeah, here we go.

12:47.959 --> 12:51.000
What should we do tonight?
You wanna watch cartoons?

12:52.583 --> 12:54.834
( door closes )

12:54.834 --> 12:57.250
Okay, he seems
okay to me.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.792
Now we can do
something fun.

13:00.792 --> 13:03.583
We could ride a water taxi

13:03.583 --> 13:06.708
or maybe go have sex
at Trader Joe's.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.000
( chuckles )

13:08.000 --> 13:10.208
You know, last time
we saw Hannah--

13:10.208 --> 13:14.041
I'm sorry, just one last thing
I can't get out of my head.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.708
Last time we saw Hannah,

13:15.708 --> 13:20.542
she called me "miss"
and you "sir."

13:20.542 --> 13:22.083
Didn't that upset you?

13:22.083 --> 13:25.458
No, it didn't.
I'm fuckin' fine, thanks.

13:25.458 --> 13:26.959
In fact,
you bringing it up
all the time

13:26.959 --> 13:28.417
is really starting
to piss me off.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.542
She's not
in our lives anymore.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.500
Why can't you just
fucking let it go?

13:32.500 --> 13:34.291
You really don't
get it, do you?

13:34.291 --> 13:38.500
No, no.
I really don't.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.125
Hannah is my dearest friend.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.875
She will always
come first.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.625
We may not
be talking right now.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.667
And I hope to God
that that changes.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.875
So, you saying
that she's not in
our lives anymore

13:52.875 --> 13:54.708
doesn't work for me.

13:54.708 --> 13:58.208
You know people hate me.
I'm a hate-able kind of person.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.917
I don't know why.
I can't help it.

13:59.917 --> 14:02.083
Maybe it's 'cause I have
a big ass and good hair.

14:02.083 --> 14:06.917
But I know-- I know
that I have principles.

14:06.917 --> 14:11.041
And one thing I don't do
is steal people's boyfriends.

14:11.041 --> 14:14.125
But you ruined that.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.750
Don't you see that?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.417
I'll never forgive you.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.625
I will never
forgive you for that.

14:21.625 --> 14:26.041
We could die in the same bed
and I will never forgive you.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.000
Jessa, come back here!

14:56.208 --> 14:57.959
Fuck.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.959
Sophie, you run
that website?

15:00.959 --> 15:03.000
- Uh-huh.
- That's amazing.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.375
It's called
Desmerize.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.458
No, I know what it's called.
It's my favorite one.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.458
I'm on that site
like all the time.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.125
Thank you.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.166
No, thank you.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.125
- ( chuckles )
- What?

15:15.125 --> 15:17.917
- It's just that, um--
- What?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.500
Um, ever since
you were on "Charmed,"

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
I've, like...

15:23.792 --> 15:27.333
- loved you.
- Oh, my God, Sophie,
I love you.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.708
Oh.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.375
And let's, um--
let's definitely do
that interview later

15:32.375 --> 15:34.250
- that we talked about?
- Okay, definitely.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.625
- Okay, cool.
- I can't wait.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.542
- Hi, girls.
- Hey.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.500
- ( giggling )
- Later.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
Hey.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.750
- How's it going?
- Ray.

15:44.750 --> 15:45.792
Where's Tandace?

15:45.792 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, she--
fuck, her dad died,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.708
so she had to take five.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.083
- Oh, no.
- Marnie: Whoa.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.500
Yeah, yeah.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.125
Was it a--
sudden, or...?

15:56.125 --> 15:57.500
I don't really know
the details,

15:57.500 --> 16:01.708
but it sounded
pretty serious, you know?

16:01.708 --> 16:05.000
Desi, look, I'm gonna be
joining you guys on the tour

16:05.000 --> 16:08.708
carrying guitar cases,
fetching snacks, and so on.

16:08.708 --> 16:11.125
- Oh.
- So, I just really hope
we can figure out a way

16:11.125 --> 16:14.208
to keep things, um,
cordial, you know?

16:14.208 --> 16:17.708
Maybe even enjoy
a sparkling beverage
at the end of the day.

16:17.708 --> 16:21.208
I mean, I don't drink,
but, you know, I've never
refused a juice.

16:21.208 --> 16:22.542
All right.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.583
- We're all adults here.
- Exactly.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.208
I don't believe
a fuckin' thing coming
out of your mouth.

16:27.208 --> 16:30.375
Well, that's on you,
because the only time
I ever lied

16:30.375 --> 16:32.959
is when I said I cared
that you lived or died!

16:32.959 --> 16:35.333
I'm so fucking
out of here.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.917
No, you're not
going anywhere.

16:36.917 --> 16:38.583
I'm not gonna let Hannah
break us apart.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.375
I'll fuckin' run her over
with a car if I have to.

16:41.375 --> 16:45.417
God fuckin'-- God damn it!
Fucking best friend?!

16:45.417 --> 16:47.834
Oh, you have great taste
in friends, then.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.458
She's a lazy,
entitled,

16:50.458 --> 16:52.583
manipulative,
myopic narcissist

16:52.583 --> 16:55.041
who knows a fuck
of a lot less than
she thinks she does.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.333
Why do you
think I hated you
for so fucking long?

16:57.333 --> 17:00.083
Because Hannah
fucking hates you!

17:00.083 --> 17:03.083
Welcome to having
a friend,

17:03.083 --> 17:05.416
something you would
know nothing about,

17:05.416 --> 17:08.083
you fucking dumb fuck,
goat-faced fuck!

17:08.083 --> 17:10.583
Hannah is a cunt whether
she's around or not.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.250
( grunts )
Hannah's a bitch
and a cunt!

17:16.250 --> 17:19.208
Hannah's a fucking
bitch and a cunt!

17:19.208 --> 17:20.625
We're done with her!

17:20.625 --> 17:22.666
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.916
We're done with her?

17:23.916 --> 17:27.125
We will never be done
with her, you shit!

17:27.125 --> 17:29.792
Fuck!

17:29.792 --> 17:31.542
Jesus.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.291
( yells )

17:33.291 --> 17:34.625
( Jessa screams )

17:36.291 --> 17:39.041
- ( lock clicks )
- No fuckin' way!

17:39.041 --> 17:41.458
Come out!

17:41.458 --> 17:42.625
( Adam pounding on door )

17:42.625 --> 17:44.333
Open this fucking door!

17:44.333 --> 17:46.959
I'm not kidding!

17:52.375 --> 17:55.291
( panting )

17:55.291 --> 17:57.792
You're kidding me.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.417
I'm sorry.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.500
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to scare you.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.083
You didn't scare me.

18:11.083 --> 18:14.041
It was just
so over-the-top
unnecessary.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.792
Well, you're gonna
make a great therapist

18:15.792 --> 18:17.083
because you're
fucking insane.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.834
And you're gonna be
an amazing actor

18:18.834 --> 18:21.625
because
you're a narcissist
and a sociopath!

18:21.625 --> 18:24.959
Hannah told me
everything about you.

18:24.959 --> 18:26.333
Everything!

18:26.333 --> 18:28.083
I used to think
she was being dramatic,

18:28.083 --> 18:29.458
but now I know
it was all true.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.959
You're actually
the worst!

18:30.959 --> 18:32.792
Fuck you.

18:32.792 --> 18:34.458
Ass fuck!

18:34.458 --> 18:35.834
( screams )

18:47.041 --> 18:49.375
This particular
line of people

18:49.375 --> 18:51.834
is literally
my worst nightmare.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.875
Well, you're dressed
like Lance Bass, so...

19:02.875 --> 19:05.375
- Loreen:
So, when do you go on?
- Well, I don't know if I go on.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.583
You know, I put my name in,
and if they pick me,
they pick me.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.458
And then they vote
based on looks?

19:09.458 --> 19:11.834
No, Elijah, they vote
on adherence to the theme,

19:11.834 --> 19:13.708
general storytelling
ability,

19:13.708 --> 19:15.875
okay, and charisma,
et cetera.

19:15.875 --> 19:19.667
Okay, well,
that's too bad because
you are a moth nine.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.834
Why don't you guys
go sit down?
Where's Dad?

19:21.834 --> 19:23.708
Well, he'll
be here soon,
I think.

19:23.708 --> 19:26.708
Or, I don't know,
maybe he won't.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.583
I'll go get us a seat.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.458
Hannah, how are you ever
going to get to the front
of this line?

19:32.458 --> 19:34.625
The only time you shove
is to get free samples
at Whole Foods.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.542
- I don't shove
at Whole Foods.
- I'll do it.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.166
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hi, excuse me.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.291
Excuse me, ma'am.
Sorry, sir.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.250
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me real quick.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.375
I lost my place earlier.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.375
Excuse me, sir, jeez.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.375
( stage-whispers )
I put your name in twice.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.500
Hi.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.417
Hello.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.291
You waiting
to sign up?

20:03.291 --> 20:06.667
Yeah, should I pull a you
and put my name in twice?

20:06.667 --> 20:08.917
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, um, listen.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.625
I'm not gonna tell nobody,
but that was uncool.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.375
I hear you.
I didn't think it was cool.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.834
There are actually people
in there trying to live
their dream.

20:15.834 --> 20:19.458
I know.
There's no part of me that
is defending that action.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.375
I have a podcast.
I care.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.125
I get it.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.375
Hello, everybody,
welcome to The Moth.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.291
( crowd cheering )

20:31.333 --> 20:36.083
I'm Ophira Eisenberg
and tonight's theme
is jealousy,

20:36.083 --> 20:38.583
which should be
a perfect way for you

20:38.583 --> 20:41.291
to frame your sex stories.

20:41.291 --> 20:43.959
So we'll be choosing
our storytellers at random.

20:43.959 --> 20:47.625
They will come up here
and tell a true story
from their life.

20:47.625 --> 20:50.208
All right, everybody,
let's get things started.

20:50.208 --> 20:54.000
( crowd cheering )

20:55.667 --> 21:01.208
Our first
storyteller of the evening
is Leslie Johnstone.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.875
I hate Doug.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.083
I hooked up with him
two nights earlier.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.542
But who I really hate
is this Australian woman

21:11.542 --> 21:13.750
who he hooked up with
one night earlier.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.625
I don't remember her name,
so let's just call her Cunty.

21:16.625 --> 21:20.583
( laughing )

21:20.583 --> 21:22.208
I'm lying
in my bed at night,

21:22.208 --> 21:24.708
and what I'm
subconsciously wishing for

21:24.708 --> 21:26.834
is some sort
of a transformation.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.792
So, in high school,
she was such a knockout

21:29.792 --> 21:34.208
that the boys nicknamed her
Boom Boom Shauna.

21:34.208 --> 21:37.583
Man:
When I was in college,
instead of asking a girl out,

21:37.583 --> 21:40.375
I would ask her
if I could ask her out
sometime.

21:40.375 --> 21:43.208
In reality,
what's really going
through your mind is,

21:43.208 --> 21:46.166
"I'm going to buy
a house today."

21:46.166 --> 21:48.041
( laughing )

21:51.250 --> 21:55.375
Our next
storyteller is...

21:55.375 --> 21:57.083
Hannah "Horvayth."

22:00.333 --> 22:02.667
Wait, wait, you can't
bring those up.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.708
- But they're my prompts.
- What, are you an idiot?

22:04.708 --> 22:07.041
No, you'll get disqualified.
No notes.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.208
Okay.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.542
Thank you.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.375
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:16.792 --> 22:19.583
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

22:22.542 --> 22:26.083
It's actually Horvath,
but having your Polish last name
properly pronounced

22:26.083 --> 22:28.750
is, you know, kind of low
on the list of priorities.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.917
There's police brutality
to worry about and stuff.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.208
( scattered laughter )

22:33.208 --> 22:35.875
So, um...

22:35.875 --> 22:39.750
what follows
is a classic tale
of jealousy

22:39.750 --> 22:42.417
and beating it back
like the medieval dragon
that it is.

22:42.417 --> 22:45.875
In this story,
I am Viggo Mortensen
in "Lord of the Rings,"

22:45.875 --> 22:49.083
and jealousy is powerless
against my sword.

22:49.083 --> 22:52.291
And this begins the way
all stories of jealousy do--

22:52.291 --> 22:53.917
all great stories
of jealousy--

22:53.917 --> 22:58.417
which is with my ex-boyfriend
and my best friend fucking.

22:58.417 --> 23:00.792
And this is not just
any best friend.

23:00.792 --> 23:03.041
This is the best friend
who I would say looks like

23:03.041 --> 23:06.125
Brigitte Bardot
had a baby with a mermaid.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.000
( laughter )

23:08.000 --> 23:11.959
She literally had
an open fungal sore
on her face

23:11.959 --> 23:14.291
and Matthew Perry
still asked her out.

23:14.291 --> 23:16.125
( laughter )

23:16.125 --> 23:19.208
So, I guess I'm not
what you would describe
as, like, a chill girl.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.875
I'm not like a cool,
relaxed lady.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.834
Like, you would never
meet me and be like,
"That Hannah,

23:22.834 --> 23:25.125
she really goes with the flow
like a funky youth."

23:25.125 --> 23:28.250
You would be like,
"Has she snorted Adderall
in the last 60 minutes?"

23:28.250 --> 23:34.166
So when I found out
about my ex-boyfriend
and my best friend,

23:34.166 --> 23:38.458
um, I was weirdly calm,
considering that fact.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.166
Frozen, even, you know?

23:40.166 --> 23:43.333
I tried to imagine
all these horrible things,

23:43.333 --> 23:45.667
like him licking
her elephant tramp stamp

23:45.667 --> 23:48.875
and sucking her tiny tit
while she cupped his balls

23:48.875 --> 23:50.333
and then he sucked
on her lip,

23:50.333 --> 23:51.917
which is shaped
like a rosebud.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.667
And I tried to get myself
really worked up

23:53.667 --> 23:56.583
and just imagine
all this horrible stuff
on a loop,

23:56.583 --> 24:00.959
but the fact is is that
I wasn't angry,

24:00.959 --> 24:02.333
I was sad.

24:02.333 --> 24:06.458
I was sad
about what I thought
they knew I was.

24:06.458 --> 24:09.166
I thought they were
sitting there going like,
"Oh, God, Hannah's freaking out.

24:09.166 --> 24:11.333
She's gonna kill a cat
and she's gonna nail it
to our door.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.792
She's going to cry so hard

24:12.792 --> 24:15.583
that all of Greenpoint
fills with tears

24:15.583 --> 24:18.041
and it's like
fuckin' Waterworld."

24:18.041 --> 24:20.166
And you know what?
They weren't wrong.

24:20.166 --> 24:23.875
I had to fight
really, really hard
not to be that girl.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.375
And it wasn't easy.

24:25.375 --> 24:28.125
I thought about, um,
throwing a bike through
his window,

24:28.125 --> 24:29.583
but, A, he lives
on the third floor.

24:29.583 --> 24:31.333
I have very poor
upper body strength.

24:31.333 --> 24:33.500
And, B, he probably
would have appreciated it
and been like,

24:33.500 --> 24:34.959
"Thanks for the bike."

24:34.959 --> 24:36.291
( laughter )

24:36.291 --> 24:38.333
I thought about sending her
a text that said,

24:38.333 --> 24:43.458
"How does the wind feel
caressing your two  faces,
young lady?"

24:43.458 --> 24:47.417
But instead I sat
and cried and thought

24:47.417 --> 24:50.667
and ate and wrote
and masturbated thinking
about Chris Farley,

24:50.667 --> 24:52.208
which is a thing
from my childhood

24:52.208 --> 24:55.708
that I haven't
fully worked through yet.

24:55.708 --> 24:57.375
When I heard
tonight's theme
was jealousy,

24:57.375 --> 25:01.208
I knew that I needed
an end to my story,
a real end,

25:01.208 --> 25:04.000
and that end
came about 20 minutes
before I arrived here

25:04.000 --> 25:09.333
when I delivered
a very nice and not at all cheap
fruit basket to his door,

25:09.333 --> 25:12.250
along with a note
that said, "Good luck.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.083
I mean it sincerely.

25:14.083 --> 25:17.625
In perpetuity,
Hannah."

25:17.625 --> 25:20.417
'Cause that's
the fact, you know?

25:20.417 --> 25:22.625
I'm Hannah forever.

25:22.625 --> 25:25.417
No matter what I do,
no matter whether I, you know,

25:25.417 --> 25:29.208
start a new nuclear missile
crisis with my emotions

25:29.208 --> 25:31.583
or just sit back
and chill

25:31.583 --> 25:33.250
and give someone
a fruit basket.

25:33.250 --> 25:36.917
I can only control
the mayhem that I create
around me.

25:36.917 --> 25:40.959
But the crazy thing is
that when I showed up,
I heard screaming

25:40.959 --> 25:45.375
and I heard my name
and I heard madness,

25:45.375 --> 25:48.083
and I knew
that I was free,

25:48.083 --> 25:51.500
at least for tonight.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.166
That's all.
Thank you.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.417
