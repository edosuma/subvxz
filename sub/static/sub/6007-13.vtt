00:01.486 --> 00:02.852
(intercom beeps)

00:02.887 --> 00:04.888
MAN (over P.A.): May I have
your attention?

00:04.922 --> 00:08.325
The shelter will be closing
its doors in ten minutes.

00:08.359 --> 00:10.360
I repeat: the shelter will be

00:10.394 --> 00:11.828
closing its doors
in ten minutes.

00:11.863 --> 00:14.865
If you are not assigned a pod,

00:14.899 --> 00:17.467
you will need to exit
the building premises.

00:17.502 --> 00:19.135
Have a good night.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.571
AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome.
Please place index finger

00:21.606 --> 00:23.673
on the blue pad.

00:23.708 --> 00:24.841
(clicking, whirring)

00:26.344 --> 00:28.378
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
personalized meal supplement

00:28.412 --> 00:29.946
has been dispensed.

00:29.981 --> 00:34.751
Welcome. Please place index
finger on the blue pad.

00:34.785 --> 00:35.852
Hey, gorgeous.

00:35.887 --> 00:37.187
If they're running low on pods,

00:37.221 --> 00:38.989
what do you say
we share one, huh?

00:39.023 --> 00:40.524
Yeah. No, thanks.

00:40.558 --> 00:42.792
Are you sure you don't
want to change your mind?

00:42.827 --> 00:44.828
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please take your pill.

00:44.862 --> 00:46.530
Don't you know it's rude
not to answer

00:46.564 --> 00:48.465
a question when
you're asked? Huh?

00:48.499 --> 00:50.734
Where you think you're
gonna sleep tonight, huh?

00:50.768 --> 00:52.669
I asked you a question.

00:52.703 --> 00:53.904
MAN:
Hey!

00:56.574 --> 00:58.174
She gave you an answer!

00:58.209 --> 00:59.175
Are you deaf?

00:59.210 --> 01:00.310
(woman sobs quietly)

01:00.344 --> 01:01.111
Why don't you leave her alone?

01:01.145 --> 01:03.280
(sniffling)

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.193 --> 01:17.494
Thanks.

01:17.528 --> 01:18.862
That's the last thing I needed.

01:18.896 --> 01:21.865
He's right about
the pods, though.

01:21.899 --> 01:23.466
They just ran out.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.201
Great.

01:28.739 --> 01:29.973
Hey, listen...

01:30.007 --> 01:32.642
there's a shelter
over on Abbot.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.644
It's smaller;
not as nice.

01:34.679 --> 01:37.347
But sometimes,
they have beds open.

01:37.381 --> 01:40.250
I'm gonna head there
after I get my pill,

01:40.284 --> 01:42.886
so... if you want
to go together...

01:42.920 --> 01:45.689
Are you sure they have beds?

01:45.723 --> 01:46.990
Never been turned away before.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.124
And on good days,

01:48.159 --> 01:50.827
they serve real food, too.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.329
You know, the kind you eat?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.164
That'd be good for a change.

01:55.566 --> 01:57.100
Why not?
Yeah!

01:57.134 --> 01:58.234
(both laughing)

01:58.269 --> 02:00.236
What's your name?

02:00.271 --> 02:02.706
- Abby.
- Abby.

02:02.740 --> 02:03.907
AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome.
Please place...

02:03.941 --> 02:05.108
Looks like you're up, Abby.

02:05.142 --> 02:07.844
Index finger on the blue pad.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.413
AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome.
Please place index...

02:10.448 --> 02:12.682
Your personalized
meal supplement

02:12.717 --> 02:14.384
has been dispensed.

02:14.418 --> 02:16.086
MAN:
<i>So where are you from, anyway?</i>

02:16.120 --> 02:17.721
I was born in Tampa,

02:17.755 --> 02:20.290
but then my mom dragged
me to New Pittsburgh.

02:20.324 --> 02:21.925
Something tells me

02:21.959 --> 02:24.394
you're not here because
you like New Pittsburgh.

02:24.428 --> 02:26.196
Actually, it was her
boyfriend I didn't like.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.864
Hated, to be more accurate.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.366
How long you been out here?

02:29.400 --> 02:30.800
Six weeks.

02:30.835 --> 02:33.036
Does it get easier?

02:33.070 --> 02:35.305
Once you get used
to scrappin' it.

02:38.175 --> 02:40.477
Sorry.
I didn't mean to stare.

02:40.511 --> 02:42.178
That's okay.

02:42.213 --> 02:45.382
When you're sick, you do what
you have to do to get well.

02:47.051 --> 02:48.451
You never told me your name.

02:48.486 --> 02:50.954
It's Glen.

02:52.023 --> 02:52.944
The shelter's this way.

02:52.957 --> 02:54.958
- Ouch!
- Oh, sorry.

02:54.992 --> 02:56.693
My ring must've caught you.

02:56.727 --> 02:59.829
It's fine.

03:02.199 --> 03:03.633
How much further is it?

03:03.668 --> 03:05.001
Just a little bit up ahead.

03:05.036 --> 03:07.671
By the way, how tall are you?

03:07.705 --> 03:09.205
Whoa...

03:09.240 --> 03:10.840
Five-six, I bet.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.977
Whoa, I don't think...

03:15.680 --> 03:16.913
Sit down.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.754
- It's okay. It's okay.
- (weakly): Please...

03:45.643 --> 03:48.244
WOMAN:
<i>The year is 2048.</i>

03:48.279 --> 03:52.148
<i>Evolving technologies</i>
<i>can no longer be regulated.</i>

03:52.183 --> 03:56.653
<i>Dangerous advancements forever</i>
<i>alter the criminal landscape.</i>

03:56.687 --> 03:59.889
<i>Police are not prepared.</i>

03:59.924 --> 04:02.492
<i>Law enforcement combats</i>
<i>this corruption</i>

04:02.526 --> 04:06.062
<i>with a new line of defense.</i>

04:06.097 --> 04:08.698
<i>But not all are created equal.</i>

04:11.402 --> 04:14.604
RUDY: <i>The idea behind the DRNs
was to be as human as possible.</i>

04:14.638 --> 04:17.140
<i>They were based on a program</i>
<i>called Synthetic Soul.</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:18.575
JOHN:
<i>That's one of the crazy ones.</i>

04:18.608 --> 04:20.410
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.

04:20.444 --> 04:22.077
WOMAN:
<i>Now all cops...</i>

04:22.113 --> 04:24.681
<i>human and manmade together...</i>

04:24.715 --> 04:27.052
<i>take on the battle</i>

04:35.259 --> 04:36.826
WOMAN:
<i>Captain Maldonado...</i>

04:36.861 --> 04:38.828
as part of the department's
yearly review

04:38.863 --> 04:40.463
of our android officers,

04:40.498 --> 04:43.299
we've spoken to your detectives
about their MXs,

04:43.334 --> 04:45.769
but I'd like to ask you
about your DRN...

04:45.803 --> 04:48.171
DRN-0167.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.439
Dorian has been exceptional.

04:49.473 --> 04:51.007
MAN: I see that
the DRN was scheduled

04:51.041 --> 04:52.675
for reassignment
to the space station,

04:52.710 --> 04:54.844
but you were adamant
about recommissioning it

04:54.879 --> 04:56.780
for police service.
Why is that?

04:56.814 --> 04:58.681
MALDONADO:
It seemed appropriate.

05:00.885 --> 05:03.853
And how has DRN-0167 been
in the field?

05:03.888 --> 05:04.954
He's a good shot.

05:04.989 --> 05:07.724
He's good in interrogation.

05:07.758 --> 05:09.793
Uh... knows how
to handle himself.

05:09.827 --> 05:11.528
You seem nervous.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.663
Me? No. Not at all.

05:13.697 --> 05:15.465
- Should I be?
- We're reviewing the DRN,

05:15.499 --> 05:18.134
- not you, Dr. Lom.
- Yes, of course.

05:18.169 --> 05:19.903
I have no personal
stake in this.

05:19.937 --> 05:21.738
No feelings one way
or the other.

05:21.772 --> 05:23.940
Sorry, what...
what are you writing there?

05:23.974 --> 05:25.742
WOMAN 2: You chose
DRN-0167 specifically...

05:25.776 --> 05:27.410
is there a reason?

05:27.444 --> 05:28.545
I thought that Dorian
and Detective Kennex

05:28.579 --> 05:29.879
needed each other.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.347
And that's as much
as I can say.

05:31.382 --> 05:33.449
MAN:
As you are aware,

05:33.484 --> 05:35.852
the DRN line was given
the Luger Test

05:35.886 --> 05:37.187
to determine its abilities

05:37.221 --> 05:39.422
to cope with
the emotional realities

05:39.456 --> 05:41.891
of police work.
Many of them failed.

05:41.926 --> 05:45.862
Do you believe that DRN-0167
needs a Luger Test?

05:45.896 --> 05:48.097
Another Luger Test?
No. No. No, no, no, no.

05:48.132 --> 05:49.566
Dorian is saner
than most humans.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.367
I'd trust him with my child.

05:51.402 --> 05:53.570
I don't have a child.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.205
I'm currently single, but, uh,

05:55.239 --> 05:58.274
always on the lookout
for the proverbial one.

05:58.309 --> 06:00.877
Sorry... I'm not saying you're
the one... maybe you are, I...

06:01.748 --> 06:02.988
Does that answer your question?

06:03.013 --> 06:04.814
There's nothing else
you can think of?

06:04.849 --> 06:07.417
He flipped a van once.
Pretty cool.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.819
Didn't know he could do that.
RUDY: <i>But if I did</i>

06:09.854 --> 06:11.921
have a child,
I would want Dorian to raise it

06:11.956 --> 06:14.057
instead of me.

06:15.659 --> 06:17.861
WOMAN:
You mean...

06:17.895 --> 06:19.195
DRN-0167.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.064
Call me Dorian.

06:21.098 --> 06:23.933
Okay. Dorian.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.802
Can you tell us
about your experience

06:25.836 --> 06:27.804
being back on the force?

06:27.838 --> 06:30.473
When I found out my line was
to be decommissioned,

06:30.507 --> 06:32.442
I didn't know if I'd
ever be reactivated,

06:32.476 --> 06:33.610
and if I was,

06:33.644 --> 06:36.479
if I'd ever be a cop again.

06:36.513 --> 06:39.449
The fact that I get
to suit up every day,

06:39.483 --> 06:44.821
do this job and help people...

06:44.855 --> 06:47.624
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.626
Thank you.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.095
We'll let you know if we require
any further information

06:52.129 --> 06:53.796
before filing our report.

07:01.705 --> 07:03.539
Oh. Good.
You're done.

07:05.142 --> 07:07.310
That took a long time.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.344
Did it?

07:08.379 --> 07:10.179
Like, longer than usual?

07:10.214 --> 07:12.315
Way longer.

07:13.150 --> 07:14.817
Come on, we got a case.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.419
DORIAN:
<i>So, tell me,</i>

07:16.453 --> 07:18.554
<i>what did they ask</i>
<i>about me in the interview?</i>

07:18.589 --> 07:20.290
Tell me what you told them.

07:20.324 --> 07:23.993
Wish I could, but, you know,
peer reviews are confidential.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.762
Department policy.

07:25.796 --> 07:28.831
Seriously? You're not
gonna tell me anything?

07:28.866 --> 07:30.600
I told them the truth.

07:30.634 --> 07:32.869
Okay.
Yeah.

07:32.903 --> 07:33.937
That's good.

07:33.971 --> 07:35.038
All right, thank you,
my friend.

07:35.072 --> 07:36.673
I told them you have no concept

07:36.707 --> 07:37.941
of personal space

07:37.975 --> 07:40.910
or boundary;
that you scanned my balls,

07:40.945 --> 07:43.379
that you abducted a
DRN from a hospital

07:43.414 --> 07:45.515
and caused millions of dollars
worth of damage.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.849
I befriended that DRN...

07:46.884 --> 07:48.718
- Befriended? You abducted him.
- I...

07:48.752 --> 07:50.219
And that you like
to expose yourself

07:50.254 --> 07:51.921
while riding shotgun
in the cruiser.

07:51.956 --> 07:53.356
You asked to see it.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.691
I didn't ask.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.092
You showed it to me.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.863
I apologize
for scanning your balls.

08:02.266 --> 08:03.733
You did ask to see...

08:03.767 --> 08:05.635
I'm just kidding.
I'm messing with you.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.304
I didn't tell 'em any of that.

08:08.339 --> 08:09.672
Should've.

08:16.714 --> 08:18.548
JOHN:
What do we got?

08:18.582 --> 08:20.950
DORIAN: The body was found
less than an hour ago.

08:20.985 --> 08:23.453
Drone picked it up
on a routine sweep of the Wall.

08:23.487 --> 08:25.621
- Victim been I.D.'d?
- Not yet.

08:25.656 --> 08:29.292
No blood, no signs
of a struggle.

08:29.326 --> 08:30.893
She was killed
in another location,

08:30.928 --> 08:32.729
and the body was dumped here.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.738
That's strange.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.741
What's straw doing
so far outside an ag zone?

08:46.510 --> 08:48.878
She's been sewn up.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.850
I've seen this before.
This is a copycat.

08:53.884 --> 08:55.284
How would you know that?

08:55.319 --> 08:56.686
Ten years ago,

08:56.720 --> 08:58.421
a serial killer named
Michael Costa

08:58.455 --> 08:59.856
was arrested.

08:59.890 --> 09:02.058
It was his MO
to stuff them with straw,

09:02.092 --> 09:03.426
just like this.

09:04.995 --> 09:07.030
Press called him...

09:07.064 --> 09:08.531
"Straw Man."

09:08.565 --> 09:10.933
Michael Costa...

09:10.968 --> 09:13.169
currently serving
a life sentence in the Cubes.

09:13.203 --> 09:14.604
It gets more interesting.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.606
Look at the investigating
officer.

09:19.743 --> 09:21.811
This was your father's case.

09:21.845 --> 09:24.280
The collar of his career.

09:25.749 --> 09:27.917
Right before he was killed.

09:43.444 --> 09:45.924
Damn it.

09:45.949 --> 09:47.950
What's wrong?

09:47.985 --> 09:51.053
My dad's case notes are sealed.

09:51.088 --> 09:52.555
It's strange.

09:52.589 --> 09:54.590
John, your father was
still under investigation

09:54.625 --> 09:56.425
for stealing seized

09:56.460 --> 09:58.294
robotic tech
from the evidence locker

09:58.328 --> 09:59.996
and reselling it
on the black market.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.164
Allegedly.

10:01.198 --> 10:02.431
PAUL:
What? No fanfare

10:02.466 --> 10:04.133
for my return, Kennex?

10:04.168 --> 10:05.968
Detective Paul.
Great to see you.

10:06.003 --> 10:07.837
Hey, they, uh, they
want you outside.

10:07.871 --> 10:09.071
Oh, yeah? Who?

10:09.106 --> 10:10.072
Everyone in here.

10:10.107 --> 10:11.774
MALDONADO:
Okay, everybody,

10:11.809 --> 10:13.109
listen up.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.211
Victim is Abigail McKenzie,
age 16.

10:15.245 --> 10:16.813
The manner
in which the corpse was found

10:16.847 --> 10:17.947
is indicative of serial killer

10:17.981 --> 10:20.416
Michael Costa,
aka "the Straw Man."

10:20.450 --> 10:22.418
Ten years ago,
Costa killed 21 people.

10:22.452 --> 10:24.120
He would remove
all of their internal organs,

10:24.154 --> 10:27.223
including the brain,
and replace them with straw.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.458
We never found any
of the organs.

10:29.493 --> 10:31.360
He targeted teenage runaways,

10:31.395 --> 10:32.962
transients, male and female.

10:32.996 --> 10:35.665
But since Costa is serving
a life sentence,

10:35.699 --> 10:37.260
it appears we're dealing
with a copycat.

10:37.267 --> 10:38.701
Copycats tend to see themselves

10:38.735 --> 10:40.102
in the killers they emulate.

10:40.137 --> 10:41.437
Costa was a schizophrenic
psychopath.

10:41.471 --> 10:42.538
We could be looking for

10:42.573 --> 10:44.073
another mentally ill person.

10:44.107 --> 10:45.274
DORIAN: It's common
for copycats

10:45.309 --> 10:47.376
to contact the
original killers.

10:47.411 --> 10:48.544
We should go see Costa.

10:48.579 --> 10:50.279
See who he's been talking to.

10:50.314 --> 10:51.848
MALDONADO:
Do it. Paul...

10:51.882 --> 10:53.850
look into the straw that was
used to stuff the bodies.

10:53.884 --> 10:55.651
See if there's anything
unique about the material.

10:55.686 --> 10:57.453
I'll try to trace it
back to a purchase.

10:57.487 --> 10:58.654
VALERIE: I'll look at
mental institutions

10:58.689 --> 11:00.656
for any recently
released patients

11:00.691 --> 11:01.791
that fit the profile.

11:01.825 --> 11:03.392
Sounds good.

11:03.427 --> 11:05.394
Captain...

11:05.429 --> 11:06.829
I just tried to access

11:06.864 --> 11:09.065
my father's original
case notes.

11:09.099 --> 11:11.834
They're classified.

11:11.869 --> 11:14.036
I'll take care of it.

11:14.071 --> 11:16.205
Go see Costa.

11:23.447 --> 11:25.281
WARDEN:
<i>Like a lot of guys in here,</i>

11:25.315 --> 11:28.017
<i>Costa failed his genetic</i>
<i>profile as a child</i>

11:28.051 --> 11:29.418
and based on his brain scan,

11:29.453 --> 11:31.153
put on the Red List for
psychopathic tendencies.

11:31.188 --> 11:33.789
Eventually, he developed
paranoid schizophrenia.

11:33.824 --> 11:35.591
JOHN: What kind of
prisoner has he been?

11:35.626 --> 11:36.626
He's been a model inmate.

11:36.627 --> 11:37.593
He's on meds now.

11:37.628 --> 11:38.928
We put in an e-shunt

11:38.962 --> 11:40.196
that delivers them
to his bloodstream.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.331
We'll need to see
all of his correspondence:

11:42.366 --> 11:44.133
who he met with
and who he sent holos to.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.635
Of course.
It's all in his file.

11:45.669 --> 11:47.503
There aren't many.

11:47.537 --> 11:48.737
A prison bunny here and there.

11:48.739 --> 11:50.740
A couple people wanting
to write books about him.

11:50.774 --> 11:52.842
This is him.

11:52.876 --> 11:55.278
Detective, I've been
meaning to ask you...

11:55.312 --> 11:57.880
are you Edward Kennex's son?

11:57.915 --> 12:00.116
Yeah, I am.

12:00.150 --> 12:03.252
Hell of a thing he did,
putting this guy away.

12:08.358 --> 12:09.325
Michael...

12:09.359 --> 12:10.493
there are two detectives

12:10.527 --> 12:11.961
here to talk to you.

12:17.668 --> 12:18.868
(computer beeps off)

12:21.238 --> 12:22.405
WARDEN:
That's close enough.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.908
COSTA: They let me watch
news, and I'm assuming

12:25.943 --> 12:28.711
that you're here to talk about

12:28.745 --> 12:30.246
the murder of that young girl.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.480
Looks like you got a copycat.

12:31.515 --> 12:33.849
Who you been talking to, Costa?

12:33.884 --> 12:35.584
I never killed anyone.

12:35.619 --> 12:37.486
How could I be copied?

12:37.521 --> 12:38.587
Right.

12:38.622 --> 12:40.089
Someone else
killed those people,

12:40.123 --> 12:42.692
cut out their organs and
put their DNA all over you?

12:42.726 --> 12:45.828
Before my medications,
I would, uh, have blackouts.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.530
I'd lose time.

12:47.564 --> 12:48.864
They said I did it,

12:48.899 --> 12:51.500
but in my heart,
I know I didn't.

12:53.503 --> 12:56.305
After the fifth
appeal, I gave up.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.541
JOHN: You finally figured
out no one believes you?

12:58.575 --> 13:00.609
Someone did.
(sighs)

13:00.644 --> 13:03.212
Detective Kennex... he did.

13:03.246 --> 13:05.181
JOHN: The detective
that put you in here?

13:05.215 --> 13:06.749
Yeah, I was just as
surprised as anyone

13:06.783 --> 13:08.317
when he came in saying that

13:08.352 --> 13:09.785
he believed in my innocence.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.420
He said I was framed.

13:11.455 --> 13:12.922
Right before he died.

13:12.956 --> 13:15.992
Check the visitor
log for March '38.

13:16.026 --> 13:17.693
There were only three visitors.

13:17.728 --> 13:20.329
Stephanie Bragg, Tony Ferraro

13:20.364 --> 13:21.897
and Alan McDowell.

13:21.932 --> 13:23.866
COSTA: I don't know
who's in your log, but

13:23.900 --> 13:25.334
I'm telling you,

13:25.369 --> 13:28.371
Detective Kennex
came to see me.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.810
All right.

13:34.845 --> 13:37.913
For a second, let's just
say I do believe you.

13:37.948 --> 13:39.682
What did he say to you?

13:39.716 --> 13:42.385
He said something like,
he was working on an angle...

13:42.419 --> 13:44.220
something about robotics.

13:44.254 --> 13:45.788
And crooked cops.

13:45.822 --> 13:47.790
He didn't know
who he could trust.

13:47.824 --> 13:49.558
Two weeks later,

13:49.593 --> 13:51.861
he was killed in
the line of duty.

13:51.895 --> 13:53.029
Coincidence?

13:56.433 --> 13:57.867
Why didn't you say something?

13:57.901 --> 14:00.236
The proof died with
Detective Kennex.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.705
Besides...

14:02.739 --> 14:06.008
I'm just a paranoid
schizophrenic.

14:06.043 --> 14:08.244
Who would've listened?

14:10.514 --> 14:14.016
JOHN: "Tony Ferraro" is
a name my dad used.

14:14.051 --> 14:15.284
It was a pizza joint
in the Old Town,

14:15.318 --> 14:16.619
before the Wall went up.

14:16.653 --> 14:18.421
My dad used to take
me there as a kid.

14:18.455 --> 14:21.057
So your father did believe
that Costa was innocent.

14:21.091 --> 14:22.792
Something's going on.

14:22.826 --> 14:24.260
There was a reason
my father came here

14:24.294 --> 14:25.594
and didn't use his real name.

14:25.629 --> 14:27.596
If your dad's
suspicions are correct,

14:27.631 --> 14:29.031
we're not looking
for a copycat.

14:29.066 --> 14:30.199
The original killer is back.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.768
JOHN: We have to get
into his case notes.

14:40.343 --> 14:41.911
(coughs)

14:41.945 --> 14:43.813
Those supplements go down
a lot easier with clean water.

14:43.847 --> 14:46.282
The shelter over on Abbot
usually has some.

14:46.316 --> 14:48.350
I can show you the way
down there, if you want.

14:48.385 --> 14:49.518
Really?

14:55.622 --> 14:59.182
All right, guys, what do you got for us?

14:59.207 --> 15:00.174
VALERIE:
This might sound crazy,

15:00.208 --> 15:01.208
but I compared the stitching

15:01.243 --> 15:02.410
on the original victims

15:02.444 --> 15:05.012
to our latest victim,
and the technique

15:05.047 --> 15:07.081
isn't similar, it's exact.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.583
Our copycat had to have
extensive contact with Costa.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.553
Or we're not looking
for a copycat at all.

15:12.587 --> 15:14.422
PAUL: Wait... you're saying
we got the wrong guy?

15:14.456 --> 15:17.591
VALERIE: He's always
maintained his innocence.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.795
Did you get
anything from Costa?

15:20.829 --> 15:22.596
JOHN:
We're working on it.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.599
MALDONADO:
John.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.501
A minute?

15:40.482 --> 15:42.383
Your father's case file.

15:45.587 --> 15:47.621
The files were sealed by IA.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.823
I got you access.

15:48.857 --> 15:50.124
Just keep it quiet.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.426
See if there's anything
useful in them.

15:52.461 --> 15:54.095
Are you gonna be
okay with this?

15:54.129 --> 15:56.130
Yeah.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.566
Thanks.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.903
You didn't tell them
what Costa told you.

16:02.938 --> 16:04.672
My father used an alias

16:04.706 --> 16:06.240
and he went and saw him alone.

16:06.274 --> 16:07.341
Which means didn't trust
anyone in the department.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.809
That was ten years ago, John.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.010
Yeah, and some of those
people are still here.

16:10.045 --> 16:11.846
He's not.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.014
So let's starting looking
through your father's case.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.918
Listen, I'd like to go
through my father's notes

16:17.953 --> 16:19.420
myself.

16:22.791 --> 16:24.825
I need you to go to Rudy's.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.094
I sent the victim's body
over there for his analysis.

16:27.129 --> 16:29.263
Let me know if
you find anything.

16:33.435 --> 16:35.269
DORIAN:
Rudy, take a look at this.

16:35.303 --> 16:36.704
There seems to be
a small puncture wound

16:36.738 --> 16:38.172
at the tip of her index finger.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.075
Looks superficial,
but I'll do a DNA sweep.

16:42.577 --> 16:45.579
So have you heard anything
back from the review board?

16:45.614 --> 16:48.749
Actually, yes,
I-I have some news.

16:48.783 --> 16:50.384
You got a callback.

16:50.418 --> 16:51.385
A callback?

16:51.419 --> 16:53.287
Is that a good thing?

16:53.321 --> 16:54.889
Yeah.

16:54.923 --> 16:56.924
It's a little unorthodox.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.960
Do you think someone said

16:59.995 --> 17:01.362
- something bad?
- No.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.396
No, no. Not me.

17:02.430 --> 17:03.397
I know I didn't.

17:03.431 --> 17:07.067
I mean, they might
have misunderstood

17:07.102 --> 17:08.736
what I said when I mentioned...

17:08.770 --> 17:10.471
you having my baby.

17:14.009 --> 17:16.644
Oh, look, now
you're doing it, too.

17:16.678 --> 17:18.244
Let's not overreact.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.380
It's probably just
that the board

17:19.414 --> 17:20.748
hasn't seen a DRN for a while.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.650
They don't know
what to make of you.

17:22.684 --> 17:24.718
What can I do?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.119
You got to make
them comfortable.

17:26.154 --> 17:27.794
Give them something
they're familiar with.

17:28.823 --> 17:31.792
Act like an MX.

17:31.826 --> 17:33.027
That's what they want to see.

17:33.061 --> 17:36.163
Everyone loves MXs.

18:02.857 --> 18:06.460
EDWARD KENNEX:
December 21, 2036.

18:06.494 --> 18:08.596
Case number 38-14.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.799
Investigating Officer:
Detective Edward Kennex.

18:11.833 --> 18:14.702
Shawn Parks,
Caucasian male, 16,

18:14.736 --> 18:16.303
found in an abandoned lot

18:16.338 --> 18:17.938
200 meters from the Wall.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.207
Seventh victim in 18 days.

18:20.242 --> 18:21.842
Same M.O. as the others...

18:21.876 --> 18:23.377
body cavity and cranium

18:23.411 --> 18:25.279
stuffed with straw and sewn.

18:27.716 --> 18:29.450
November 14, 2037.

18:29.484 --> 18:30.484
Arrest made.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.186
Michael Costa.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.521
39-year-old
paranoid schizophrenic

18:34.556 --> 18:36.257
found wandering in a park

18:36.291 --> 18:37.992
near where the victim was found.

18:38.026 --> 18:40.861
DNA and blood
from multiple victims

18:40.895 --> 18:42.529
found on his hands and clothing.

18:42.564 --> 18:44.965
He was carrying
a surgeon's knife.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.568
An expert witness testified

18:47.602 --> 18:48.842
the stitching found on the body

18:48.870 --> 18:51.405
was done with
surgical precision.

18:51.439 --> 18:53.674
Based on evidence
I'm currently reviewing,

18:53.708 --> 18:56.677
I'm starting to feel
that Costa was abducted

18:56.711 --> 18:59.179
the night before
the final murder,

18:59.214 --> 19:01.515
had the victim's DNA
planted on his person

19:01.549 --> 19:05.352
and was transported
to the last crime scene.

19:05.387 --> 19:08.088
I believe I might have
put away the wrong guy.

19:09.391 --> 19:12.860
Maybe Michael Costa
was not the Straw Man.

19:12.894 --> 19:13.861
But if he's a patsy...

19:13.895 --> 19:16.297
then, for who?

19:16.331 --> 19:18.966
Who is really
killing these people?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.102
Further details will be
in my next transmission.

19:40.455 --> 19:42.556
Why did you circle the feet?

19:43.692 --> 19:45.926
(phone ringing)

19:45.960 --> 19:46.960
DORIAN:
It's me.

19:46.995 --> 19:48.662
Dorian, what's up?

19:48.697 --> 19:50.130
We need to show you something.

19:54.769 --> 19:58.839
Sometimes, the absence of
something is everything.

19:58.873 --> 20:00.553
Yeah, I read that in
<i>How to be a Detective.</i>

20:00.575 --> 20:03.310
Everybody has something
under their fingernails.

20:03.345 --> 20:05.079
A particle, molecule of dirt...

20:05.113 --> 20:06.747
This one has nothing.

20:06.781 --> 20:08.082
That's because the killer
cleaned the bodies.

20:08.116 --> 20:09.249
It's part
of his M.O.

20:09.284 --> 20:10.517
True. But these kids

20:10.552 --> 20:11.919
were living on the
streets, right?

20:11.953 --> 20:13.253
No matter how well
somebody cleaned,

20:13.288 --> 20:14.321
there'd always be

20:14.356 --> 20:15.989
some atomic trace of dirt.

20:16.024 --> 20:17.324
Tell him your theory.

20:18.293 --> 20:20.427
This might sound crazy,

20:20.462 --> 20:22.763
but I don't think this body
is the real victim.

20:22.797 --> 20:23.964
I think it's a replica.

20:23.998 --> 20:26.333
A replica?

20:27.302 --> 20:29.803
Look, according to her parents,

20:29.838 --> 20:31.171
she was only on the
streets for three weeks.

20:31.206 --> 20:32.573
That's not enough
time to abduct

20:32.607 --> 20:34.108
and clone someone.
Yeah.

20:34.142 --> 20:36.176
That's sort of where
my hypothesis ends.

20:55.230 --> 20:56.930
In the original case files,

20:56.965 --> 20:58.932
my father circled the feet
of all the victims,

20:58.967 --> 21:01.568
like they had
something in common.

21:01.603 --> 21:03.771
DORIAN:
She's flat-footed.

21:09.177 --> 21:11.278
JOHN:
What are you looking for?

21:11.312 --> 21:12.946
RUDY:
My old organic printer.

21:17.919 --> 21:19.219
Now what are you looking for?

21:19.254 --> 21:20.220
Cupcake batter.

21:20.255 --> 21:22.589
When you print organics,

21:22.624 --> 21:25.959
a natural settling occurs
as the raw material sets.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.661
So if you're printing
from bottom to top,

21:27.695 --> 21:31.031
on a flat surface,
the materials naturally conform

21:31.065 --> 21:32.232
to that surface.

21:32.267 --> 21:34.268
It works for cupcakes,

21:34.302 --> 21:36.103
but if you're bio-printing a
human body who's standing up...

21:36.137 --> 21:38.405
There'd be no way to maintain
the arches in the feet.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.940
Leaving you flat-foooted.

21:39.974 --> 21:42.776
I mean, th-the new bio-printers
have corrected that flaw,

21:42.811 --> 21:45.078
but it's quite common
in the old ones.

21:49.467 --> 21:50.627
It was my birthday last week.

21:50.652 --> 21:51.573
Thanks for remembering.

21:51.586 --> 21:52.953
How old?

21:52.987 --> 21:55.622
Perpetual 39, I like to say.
(laughs)

21:55.657 --> 21:57.458
No, I mean how old
were the bio-printers

21:57.492 --> 21:58.425
before they corrected the flaw?

21:58.460 --> 22:00.260
About five years ago.

22:00.295 --> 22:01.261
So he was using an old printer.

22:01.296 --> 22:02.763
He must be.

22:02.797 --> 22:04.097
Why go through the trouble of

22:04.132 --> 22:05.265
trying to <i>copy</i> your victims?

22:05.300 --> 22:06.900
Why not just <i>abduct</i> them?

22:08.236 --> 22:10.103
RUDY:
To hide them.

22:10.138 --> 22:11.672
JOHN:
If someone goes missing,

22:11.706 --> 22:14.241
the department has drones
that never stop searching.

22:14.275 --> 22:15.709
If someone turns up dead...

22:15.743 --> 22:17.878
nobody's going to be
looking for them anymore.

22:17.912 --> 22:19.046
So, whoever's doing this

22:19.080 --> 22:20.320
wants to keep
his victims alive.

22:20.348 --> 22:23.016
Yeah. Why?

22:33.561 --> 22:36.196
(printer whirring)

22:36.231 --> 22:38.465
(whimpering, gasping)

22:38.500 --> 22:39.466
(screaming)

22:39.501 --> 22:40.634
Let me go!

22:45.479 --> 22:47.799
He's using a modified organic printer.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.725
He can print the skin
with bio-ink...

22:49.760 --> 22:51.427
skeleton, musculature...

22:51.461 --> 22:54.997
The old bio-printer couldn't
print the organs to scale.

22:55.032 --> 22:56.899
A medical examiner
would have noticed right away.

22:56.933 --> 22:58.768
That's why he uses straw.

22:58.802 --> 23:01.671
This wasn't the ritualized need
of a serial killer,

23:01.705 --> 23:02.672
this was a way to hide
that the bodies

23:02.706 --> 23:05.007
were bio-printed copies.

23:05.042 --> 23:09.111
PAUL: That means his victims
could still be alive.

23:09.146 --> 23:11.147
MALDONADO: <i>Your father was the
lead investigator at Costa's trial.</i>

23:11.181 --> 23:13.549
If he knew he was putting an
innocent man behind bars...

23:13.583 --> 23:16.385
He knew he made a mistake,
and he was gonna own up to it.

23:16.420 --> 23:17.720
Why not tell someone?

23:17.754 --> 23:19.255
My father was investigating
new evidence

23:19.289 --> 23:20.623
before he was going
to come forward.

23:20.657 --> 23:22.858
He never had a chance to.

23:22.893 --> 23:24.794
Look, this is bigger
than a serial killer.

23:24.828 --> 23:26.829
Costa was set up.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.565
The arrest was designed
to cover up the real case.

23:29.599 --> 23:30.766
Which is what exactly?

23:30.801 --> 23:32.702
I don't know yet,
but Costa told me

23:32.736 --> 23:34.704
that my father could
prove he was innocent,

23:34.738 --> 23:36.806
and that the cover-up
involved stolen robotics.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.975
And he mistrusted everybody,
including the police department,

23:40.010 --> 23:41.477
and then he was killed.

23:41.511 --> 23:43.746
And I don't think
it was a coincidence.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.317
(knocking on door)

23:48.351 --> 23:49.585
I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain.

23:49.619 --> 23:52.121
They found another body
near the Wall.

23:53.590 --> 23:55.291
What do you got?

23:55.325 --> 23:59.628
The victim has been identified
as Vaishali Jain, age 17.

23:59.663 --> 24:03.432
Last known address,
418 Sully Road, Seattle.

24:03.467 --> 24:06.001
Parents reported her missing
to the local PD last month.

24:06.036 --> 24:07.937
It appears she ran away.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.310
You're telling me this is a
bio-printed copy of the victim?

24:14.344 --> 24:16.178
That's right.
The real Vaishali

24:16.213 --> 24:18.748
could still be alive somewhere.

24:18.782 --> 24:20.616
Why does he want 'em alive?
What's he doing with them?

24:20.650 --> 24:24.120
I don't know, but this is
the second victim in two days.

24:24.154 --> 24:27.556
Look at this... the bio-printer
copies the skin perfectly.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.425
Both young women

24:29.459 --> 24:31.393
had pin pricks
on their forefingers.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.497
The city just introduced

24:34.531 --> 24:38.834
meal supplement dispensers in
all major shelters last year.

24:38.869 --> 24:40.302
They prick your finger

24:40.337 --> 24:42.772
to determine what vitamins
and nutrients you need.

24:42.806 --> 24:44.473
The shelter.

24:44.508 --> 24:46.308
Every serial killer has
a hunting ground... that's his.

24:46.343 --> 24:47.576
We need
to get plainclothes assets

24:47.611 --> 24:49.111
in all those shelters
immediately.

24:49.146 --> 24:50.546
The department doesn't
have the resources

24:50.580 --> 24:52.014
for the scope of
that operation.

24:52.048 --> 24:53.215
We need to work smarter.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.517
DORIAN:
How?

24:54.551 --> 24:56.852
We flush him out.

24:56.887 --> 25:00.790
Okay, we have 46 shelters
in the city.

25:00.824 --> 25:03.793
I've ordered all available
uniforms and MXs to patrol

25:03.827 --> 25:05.828
44 of them
and make their presence known.

25:05.862 --> 25:08.531
<i>If you notice anything out</i>
<i>of the ordinary, call it in.</i>

25:08.565 --> 25:10.833
<i>The hope is, the real Straw Man</i>
<i>will see the officers</i>

25:10.867 --> 25:12.701
<i>and get spooked</i>
<i>before abducting anyone else.</i>

25:12.736 --> 25:15.037
<i>That's where you guys come in.</i>

25:15.071 --> 25:19.074
You're gonna stake out
the remaining two shelters.

25:19.109 --> 25:20.476
We drive the Straw Man
to one of these,

25:20.510 --> 25:22.178
we're gonna see him
make his move.

25:23.113 --> 25:24.814
PAUL:
Yeah, this is...

25:24.848 --> 25:27.516
this is the last time
I'm the homeless guy.

25:27.551 --> 25:29.618
You know how long it takes
to wash this stink off?

25:29.653 --> 25:31.253
You sure
that's not your cologne, Paul?

25:31.288 --> 25:32.788
Oh, very funny.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.690
Will you just please
get back to work, please?

25:36.226 --> 25:38.527
Oh, you want to watch
where you're going, old timer?

25:38.562 --> 25:41.030
Hey, easy... easy, kid.
Nice sunglasses.

25:41.064 --> 25:43.465
You do realize it's nighttime.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.601
These things got night vision,
man, so don't try anything.

25:45.635 --> 25:48.737
Who'd you steal 'em from? Oh, your
mom gave 'em to me to say thanks.

25:48.772 --> 25:49.872
(laughs)

25:49.906 --> 25:52.942
Trying to get
a bed tonight or what?

25:52.976 --> 25:54.743
Yeah. I mean, I was.

25:54.778 --> 25:56.979
- They're all out.
- Hmm.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.148
Catch you later, man.
Take it easy.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.182
Listen, you got
a bitcoin stick?

26:00.217 --> 26:02.952
(scoffs) Bitcoin stick.

26:02.986 --> 26:04.587
There's not much on it, man.

26:04.621 --> 26:06.055
What's it to you?

26:08.792 --> 26:10.092
Why don't you get yourself

26:10.126 --> 26:11.594
a place to stay tonight?

26:11.628 --> 26:14.029
Wait, how-how are you
so flush, man?

26:14.064 --> 26:17.166
Listen, don't worry
about that, all right?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.068
You're gonna need a place to
sleep tonight 'cause I'm staying

26:19.102 --> 26:21.237
at your mom's.
(laughs)

26:21.271 --> 26:23.706
Hey, for real...

26:23.740 --> 26:26.609
Thanks, man.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.847
DORIAN:

Oh, I wish I could do your
performance evaluation again.

26:54.671 --> 26:56.705
I wish I could do it over, too.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.607
I should have acted like an MX.

26:58.642 --> 27:00.809
They love those things.

27:05.248 --> 27:09.051
John, the stuff they said
your father did...

27:09.085 --> 27:11.487
could it be true?

27:16.126 --> 27:18.160
When I was a kid,

27:18.194 --> 27:21.063
my dad patrolled downtown,

27:21.097 --> 27:22.898
a real tough beat,

27:22.933 --> 27:24.600
gang controlled.

27:24.634 --> 27:27.002
Lot of cops were on the take.

27:27.037 --> 27:29.471
One day, his unit takes down
this dealer,

27:29.506 --> 27:32.841
a real heavy hitter.

27:32.876 --> 27:38.213
They find seven million dollars
in cash under the floorboards.

27:38.248 --> 27:42.184
Now, the task force leader
tells everybody to take a cut.

27:45.388 --> 27:47.690
My dad refused.

27:49.592 --> 27:52.628
So, the guy takes a scatter gun,

27:52.662 --> 27:54.396
puts it to his head and says

27:54.431 --> 27:56.999
if he doesn't take a cut
and get his hands dirty

27:57.033 --> 28:00.269
like everyone else, then,
he's gonna blow his brains out.

28:00.303 --> 28:03.372
Call it in as a
ten-double-zero, officer down.

28:05.041 --> 28:07.376
Still, my dad refused.

28:09.245 --> 28:10.813
Lucky for him,

28:10.847 --> 28:13.949
the guy didn't have the balls
to shoot one of his own.

28:13.984 --> 28:16.151
Then, a month later,
their whole unit got busted

28:16.186 --> 28:21.023
in an IA investigation, and
the only one left standing...

28:21.057 --> 28:24.126
was my dad.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.234
That's who he was.

28:34.637 --> 28:37.673
He's the reason I became a cop.

28:37.707 --> 28:41.643
There's no way he was dirty.

28:49.719 --> 28:51.920
Hey.

28:51.955 --> 28:54.156
Hi.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.092
If you're looking for a hot
meal, the shelter over on

28:57.127 --> 28:58.827
Abbott usually...

29:00.630 --> 29:02.498
WOMAN:
Are you okay?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.666
Yeah. Never mind.

29:16.762 --> 29:20.164
Hey, honey, want
to keep me warm tonight?

29:20.198 --> 29:22.500
Handsome man like you...
I'll give you a discount.

29:22.534 --> 29:24.669
Thank you.

29:43.889 --> 29:47.592
I need an I.D. on a van.

29:47.626 --> 29:49.560
MAN (over radio): Possible
suspect going down Addison

29:49.595 --> 29:50.761
at Fourth, drone in pursuit.

29:50.796 --> 29:52.096
Show us responding.

29:53.932 --> 29:56.033
The drone's picking up
two heat signatures.

29:56.068 --> 29:59.236
Looks like the driver,
and there's a body

29:59.271 --> 30:00.771
in the back of the van.

30:00.806 --> 30:02.039
He's alive,

30:02.074 --> 30:03.541
but looks like he's immobile.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.076
He turned south on Patterson.

30:20.592 --> 30:22.793
VALERIE: John, the van stopped
outside Pier 12.

30:22.828 --> 30:24.829
Drone imaging
is downloading now.

30:24.863 --> 30:26.897
He just left the victim
and went inside.

30:26.932 --> 30:28.232
I think he made us.

30:28.266 --> 30:29.800
And we got close enough
to make him, too.

30:29.835 --> 30:31.302
I'll start running facial rec.

30:35.641 --> 30:38.909
John, I got a hit.
Suspect I.D.'s as Glen Dunbar.

30:38.944 --> 30:41.712
Has a record of trading illegal
tech on the black market.

30:43.348 --> 30:45.650
I got a heat signature.

30:52.257 --> 30:53.491
DORIAN:
His vitals are stable.

30:53.525 --> 30:54.759
JOHN:
Alert the EMTs.

30:54.793 --> 30:56.427
No sirens.

30:56.461 --> 30:59.096
Let's go.

31:04.770 --> 31:07.004
(computer trilling)

31:29.061 --> 31:31.529
(whispers):
Go.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.074
I've got a body.

31:43.108 --> 31:45.042
It's got some kind
of tech on it.

31:48.213 --> 31:50.381
John, I've got
two heat signatures.

32:02.327 --> 32:03.794
She's alive.

32:03.829 --> 32:06.163
Alert the EMTs.
Let's get them out of here now.

32:06.198 --> 32:08.899
Come on, move! Move!

32:17.609 --> 32:19.376
(clatter in distance)

32:19.411 --> 32:20.611
(gunshot in distance)

32:20.645 --> 32:21.979
MX (over radio):
Shot fired.

32:22.013 --> 32:23.314
South side.
Check it out.

32:36.795 --> 32:39.597
(bird flutters)

33:01.686 --> 33:03.087
He's down. Don't move!

33:06.594 --> 33:08.034
DORIAN (over radio):
Suspect is down.

33:08.059 --> 33:09.727
We're at the south exit.

33:15.534 --> 33:17.701
I think I just found
his workroom.

33:25.477 --> 33:26.644
No vitals.

33:28.914 --> 33:30.447
It's a duplicate.

33:30.482 --> 33:31.582
There's an explosive device

33:31.616 --> 33:33.017
inside its abdominal cavity.

33:33.051 --> 33:34.885
It's rigged to detonate.
Clear the area

33:34.920 --> 33:35.986
and dismantle it.

33:36.021 --> 33:37.321
John, do you copy?

33:37.355 --> 33:38.889
Copy that.

33:58.599 --> 33:59.960
(choking) (grunts)

34:04.271 --> 34:05.305
(grunts)

34:05.339 --> 34:06.639
(groans)

34:13.080 --> 34:15.215
(panting)

34:19.987 --> 34:22.155
DORIAN:
John.

34:24.058 --> 34:25.658
You okay?

34:27.594 --> 34:30.864
Yeah.

34:30.898 --> 34:32.998
You look it.

34:43.911 --> 34:46.513
It's human tissue fused
with some sort of biotech.

34:58.192 --> 35:00.193
He's been made into a cyborg.

35:08.746 --> 35:10.146
This printer was
in police evidence.

35:10.171 --> 35:13.339
Still got the embedded
locker tag on it.

35:13.374 --> 35:16.376
Every victim he ever printed...
they're right here.

35:19.914 --> 35:23.316
All of these parts
have evidence numbers, too.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.552
He was using them on himself.

35:26.587 --> 35:28.855
What is it?

35:28.889 --> 35:31.357
My father was accused
of stealing robotics parts

35:31.392 --> 35:33.893
from the evidence locker and
selling them on the black market.

35:33.928 --> 35:36.196
He said he was investigating
new evidence.

35:36.230 --> 35:39.499
I think he connected the flat
feet to this stolen printer.

35:39.533 --> 35:41.901
Who was in charge of
the evidence locker at the time?

35:41.936 --> 35:44.270
Officer Silas Grant.

35:44.305 --> 35:45.939
Where's Grant now?

35:45.973 --> 35:48.475
Grant was shot and killed
in the line of duty.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.678
Three weeks after your father.

35:53.414 --> 35:55.548
Coincidence?

36:00.988 --> 36:02.789
VALERIE:
Glen Dunbar had

36:02.823 --> 36:05.458
a degenerative disease that
affected his nervous system.

36:05.493 --> 36:07.093
He thought he could use
advanced cybernetics

36:07.127 --> 36:08.995
to combat his condition.
So...

36:09.029 --> 36:11.364
this was all about trying
to rebuild his body?

36:11.398 --> 36:15.268
VALERIE: These people were used as
test patients for his cyborg parts.

36:15.302 --> 36:17.871
His experiments worked for a
while, but, after ten years,

36:17.905 --> 36:19.873
the biotech began
to break down.

36:19.907 --> 36:21.508
He needed new test subjects

36:21.542 --> 36:23.409
if he was gonna find
a more permanent solution

36:23.444 --> 36:24.711
to his illness.

36:24.745 --> 36:26.880
So he started killing again.

36:33.487 --> 36:35.021
Excuse me.

36:35.055 --> 36:36.856
You got it.

36:36.891 --> 36:38.124
PAUL: I'll get started
on that report.

36:38.158 --> 36:39.759
Okay.

36:42.796 --> 36:44.597
I think my father discovered
that the printer

36:44.632 --> 36:48.334
was stolen from police evidence
and he was killed for it.

36:48.369 --> 36:50.303
It could very well be true.
It makes sense

36:50.337 --> 36:52.405
that Grant was selling
the parts to the black market

36:52.439 --> 36:54.140
and was trying to pin

36:54.174 --> 36:57.010
the missing tech on your father,
to destroy his credibility.

36:57.044 --> 36:59.279
That way, if anything
from your dad's investigation

36:59.313 --> 37:02.415
came to light, it would
already be cast in doubt.

37:02.449 --> 37:05.218
Did Grant have anything to do
with my father's murder?

37:06.453 --> 37:07.854
We'll never know for sure.

37:07.888 --> 37:10.690
Because they believe
Dunbar killed him, too.

37:10.724 --> 37:14.160
You got the man who
killed your father, John.

37:14.194 --> 37:16.629
And Costa?

37:16.664 --> 37:19.532
He's being released right now.

37:19.567 --> 37:23.136
<i>He's been cleared</i>
<i>of all 21 murder charges,</i>

37:23.170 --> 37:24.571
<i>and we're getting him</i>
<i>the proper treatment</i>

37:24.605 --> 37:27.674
<i>for his mental illness.</i>

37:32.246 --> 37:35.582
John, do you need
to take some personal time?

37:38.218 --> 37:40.186
No.

37:40.220 --> 37:42.355
I'm good.

37:45.893 --> 37:47.694
John.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.264
You finished your dad's work

37:51.298 --> 37:55.101
and cleared his name.
He'd be proud.

37:57.738 --> 37:59.839
Thanks.

38:10.451 --> 38:12.352
You must be Dorian.

38:12.386 --> 38:15.655
(with MX voice): Affirmative.
DRN-0167 reporting.

38:15.689 --> 38:17.123
Please, have a seat.

38:20.094 --> 38:22.495
Do you know
why I called you here today?

38:22.529 --> 38:24.163
Statistically, the odds are

38:24.198 --> 38:26.165
this is related to
my job performance.

38:27.267 --> 38:30.603
Why are you talking
like an MX-43?

38:30.638 --> 38:33.940
(regular voice): Don't
you love those things?

38:33.974 --> 38:36.275
Uh, they're fine models.

38:36.310 --> 38:37.644
Anyhow...

38:37.678 --> 38:39.746
I just called you here today
to let you know

38:39.780 --> 38:42.382
your term has been renewed.

38:42.416 --> 38:45.451
You've received glowing reviews
across the board.

38:45.486 --> 38:47.086
I did?

38:47.121 --> 38:49.255
Especially from your partner...

38:50.557 --> 38:52.525
who gave you credit
for still wanting

38:52.559 --> 38:54.794
to be on the force.
Seems you've made

38:54.828 --> 38:56.896
some very positive
impressions here.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.464
You will continue
your assignment

38:58.499 --> 39:00.600
with Detective Kennex.

39:09.910 --> 39:12.011
(groans softly)

39:13.580 --> 39:15.682
(sighs)

39:18.786 --> 39:20.920
Hey.

39:22.823 --> 39:24.290
What are you doing here?

39:24.324 --> 39:26.959
I followed your locator chip.

39:27.995 --> 39:30.296
I need to have
that thing dug out.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.467
What do you got there?

39:34.501 --> 39:37.236
I'm expressing my gratitude.
For what?

39:37.271 --> 39:40.807
The review board gave me
my final recommendation,

39:40.841 --> 39:43.810
based on your glowing review.
My term has been extended.

39:43.844 --> 39:46.612
"Glowing" is a bit
of an exaggeration.

39:46.647 --> 39:48.781
Open it.

39:51.452 --> 39:53.553
(sighs)

39:54.455 --> 39:57.790
Wow. I wonder
what it is.

39:57.825 --> 39:59.659
It's a leg.

40:02.262 --> 40:03.730
Never mind.

40:03.764 --> 40:06.566
This baby's got 20% more
power in the push-off

40:06.600 --> 40:09.368
than the one you have now,
better integrated sensors

40:09.403 --> 40:12.371
in the knee and ankle and an
enhanced neural interface.

40:12.406 --> 40:14.340
This model will not
even be on the market

40:14.374 --> 40:15.775
for the next few months

40:15.809 --> 40:18.010
but I got Rudy
to pull some strings.

40:18.879 --> 40:21.013
I don't...

40:24.218 --> 40:26.352
Thank you.

40:27.221 --> 40:30.523
Hope you like it.

40:33.227 --> 40:36.229
(sniffles, sighs)

40:36.263 --> 40:38.331
(sighs)

40:41.201 --> 40:44.337
Listen...

40:45.205 --> 40:47.473
I know I'm not human,

40:47.508 --> 40:49.909
and I could never be
what Pelham was to you.

40:49.943 --> 40:52.445
- Hey, Dorian... - I get it.
I really do.

40:56.350 --> 40:59.719
But I'm glad Maldonado
put us together.

41:05.859 --> 41:09.695
Am I really the reason that
you want to stay on the force?

41:09.730 --> 41:12.598
I... uh, no,
I never said that.

41:12.633 --> 41:14.267
To the interviewer you did.

41:14.301 --> 41:15.468
Um, no, no, I didn't.

41:15.502 --> 41:17.336
He must have heard me wrong.

41:17.371 --> 41:18.771
That is the nicest thing

41:18.806 --> 41:20.807
anyone has ever
said about me, John.

41:25.913 --> 41:28.848
Dude, don't. Please.
Don't do that.

41:28.882 --> 41:30.850
I was made to feel, John.

41:30.884 --> 41:33.085
(quietly):
Oh, man...

41:35.055 --> 41:38.925
Unbelievable.
(exhales)

41:42.896 --> 41:46.098
(comm beeping)

41:46.133 --> 41:47.834
MAN: one-nine, we got
a robbery in progress

41:47.868 --> 41:49.802
on West 55th Street.

41:49.837 --> 41:52.004
Any available units,
please respond.

41:54.408 --> 41:57.677
Show us responding.
(sighs wearily)

41:59.112 --> 42:00.112
Thank you.

42:00.147 --> 42:01.547
Appreciate that.
