00:06.540 --> 00:08.376
(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.409 --> 00:12.080
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.482
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.515 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.417 --> 00:17.818
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.851 --> 00:20.054
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.156
These are their stories.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.826
Never thought
he'd do this, but...

00:25.859 --> 00:28.696
things have been
getting bad for months.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.698
How so?

00:30.731 --> 00:33.501
Tommy's changed.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.304
He was a very loving,
sweet person.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.705
Now he gets mad about
everything.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.308
And he takes it out on me.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.843
What happened
last night?

00:42.876 --> 00:47.415
He was ranting
about the neighbors.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.384
He thinks
they're spying on us.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.485
They're, like, 80.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.653
Okay?

00:52.686 --> 00:53.654
Did you fight?

00:53.687 --> 00:54.855
As usual.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.727
He...starts hitting me.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.796
Then he
rips off my clothes.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.199
Says he's
gonna get his gun

01:05.233 --> 01:06.867
if I don't
do what he says.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.469
[scoffs]

01:08.502 --> 01:11.839
That part was new.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.341
Son of a bitch.

01:15.876 --> 01:20.414
I can't believe he'd do this.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.750
I can't let it go on.

01:22.783 --> 01:26.254
Not with the baby coming.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.822
Where did he hit you,
Mrs. Callahan?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.561
He's a cop.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.663
He knows how to hit
without leaving a mark.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.132
I wasn't implying--
I knew it.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.433
I knew you wouldn't
believe me.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.768
That's not true.
No?

01:40.801 --> 01:42.903
You guys never
cover for each other?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.372
Bull!

01:44.405 --> 01:46.340
We ask all of our victims
the same questions.

01:46.374 --> 01:50.544
This is pointless.
You can leave now.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.313
Mrs. Callahan, you gotta
give us a chance

01:52.346 --> 01:53.414
to help you out here.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.516
I already tried.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.385
I told that
little partner of his

01:57.418 --> 01:59.153
that Tommy was hitting me.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.788
She didn't do anything.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.890
Big help!

02:04.925 --> 02:07.161
Leave me alone, I'm tired.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.128
Let's go, sleeping beauty.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.663
We'll take you
to the shelter if you want,

02:09.697 --> 02:10.831
but you can't stay here.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.501
Officers Callahan, Vaill?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.403
Elliot Stabler.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.171
Olivia Benson,
Special Victims.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.240
Oh, detectives, huh?
Somebody report a sex crime?

02:19.273 --> 02:20.374
Actually,
we were wondering

02:20.408 --> 02:21.642
if both of you
could come with us.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.676
Why?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.912
Your C.O. knows about it.
It won't take long.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.315
We're on the clock,
Detectives.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.682
We'll come by
after our shift.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.484
Let's take care of it now.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.852
All right.

02:31.885 --> 02:32.786
Can we take our own car,

02:32.820 --> 02:34.688
or should we ride
in the back of yours?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.857
You're not under arrest.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.560
Uh, go ahead,
we'll follow you.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.018
I don't know why my wife

03:38.051 --> 03:39.487
would say that
I raped her, Detective.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.255
It isn't true.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.490
Was it possible this was
a misunderstanding?

03:42.523 --> 03:43.591
No, sir.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.592
I understand the difference

03:44.625 --> 03:47.461
between consensual
sexual relations and rape.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.563
Jamie seem upset last night?

03:49.597 --> 03:50.864
I didn't perceive
anything unusual

03:50.898 --> 03:53.567
about her behavior
or emotional state.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.371
Your training's kicking in.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.308
I don't know
what you mean, Detective.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.676
Yeah, you do.

04:02.710 --> 04:06.414
You're in cop mode.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.415
Polite,

04:07.448 --> 04:10.451
professional, detached.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.685
Is that a problem, Detective?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.522
Well, you know,
things are gonna be a lot easier

04:14.555 --> 04:18.959
if you and I just talk to
each other like normal people.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.796
Or whatever you want, Tommy.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.700
You know, you gotta
give me an explanation here.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.437
She making this all up?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.939
He slapped her. Once.
In the heat of an argument.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.442
After Jamie
hit him numerous times.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.477
Did you talk her
out of reporting it?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.878
No.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.514
She elected
not to press charges.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.482
So you ignored

04:41.515 --> 04:43.651
the domestic violence
must-arrest policy.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.787
Tommy is her only source
of income.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.322
They're expecting a child,

04:48.356 --> 04:50.023
and with one misdemeanor
D.V. conviction,

04:50.057 --> 04:51.725
Tommy loses his gun
and his job.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.727
If it were your partner,
what would you do?

04:53.761 --> 04:55.763
You did nothing, Kristen.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.064
Wrong.
I gave Jamie my card.

04:57.097 --> 05:00.368
I told her to call me
if it ever happened again.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.536
Tommy promised me
he wouldn't.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.406
He's not like that, usually.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.040
She thinks
I'm having an affair.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.077
Okay.
With your partner?

05:10.110 --> 05:13.647
No, that never happened.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.717
But there was somebody.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.388
Barrel sucker
I met at a bar.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.691
I don't even know her name.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.126
That's why Jamie's
doing this to me, Detective.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.629
To punish me.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.697
And I deserve it.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.701
What about the fights?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.569
What are you talking about?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.771
You know,
the getting physical with her.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.074
Hitting her.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.544
It's not true.

05:43.577 --> 05:47.481
Well, Officer Vaill
knows about it.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.583
What do you think she's telling
my partner right now?

05:49.617 --> 05:50.951
(Benson)
Are you sleeping with him?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.723
Let me be very clear,
Detective Benson.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.759
I'd be more inclined to
have an affair with you.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.563
Got it.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.797
Jamie invents things.

06:03.831 --> 06:07.067
If nothing else, this proves
how emotionally unstable she is.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.669
Okay, so what about Tommy?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.905
How is he dealing with
impending fatherhood?

06:11.939 --> 06:12.740
He's thrilled.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.008
Gotta stress him out
a little bit.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.511
He knows how to handle stress.
He's been through worse.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.513
When?
Afghanistan.
He's Army Reserve.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.682
They get shot at
and bombed at every other day.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.719
That must have been
rough on him.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.820
Has it affected him?

06:31.725 --> 06:34.462
Gonna take that as a yes.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.000
How was the canvass?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.735
Interesting and confusing.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.638
Callahan's either a great guy
or an unpredictable bastard,

06:44.672 --> 06:45.939
depending on
who you talk to.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.575
That's helpful.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.777
Well, it's better than
Munch's evil twin theory.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.745
He's asking us for
his P.B.A. rep.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.781
Well...
who do we believe here?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.483
Callahan or his wife?

06:55.516 --> 06:56.484
Well, she's questionable.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.519
So's he.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.386
I don't know.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.022
If they were just
a civilian couple?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.691
Cut 'em loose.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.192
Do it.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.660
(Captain Pierce)
Don.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.761
(Cragen)
Barbara.

07:07.795 --> 07:08.829
This is Captain
Barbara Pierce

07:08.862 --> 07:10.664
from the 7-4.
Captain.

07:10.698 --> 07:13.667
I wanna thank you both
for handling this like you did.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.470
We're letting Callahan go.
No charges.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.005
Well, I'm putting him
on modified duty.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.006
We'll get him help.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.141
(Callahan)
Captain.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.010
It's all a mistake.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.244
(Captain Pierce)
Let's go, Tom.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.681
I'll give you a lift.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.851
Can I get my weapon,
Detective?

07:33.754 --> 07:34.722
What?

07:34.755 --> 07:35.789
Come on with me, Tom.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.758
Wait, no.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.759
I need my gun.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.261
Step back,
Officer Callahan.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.163
You're putting me
on modified?

07:45.799 --> 07:51.639
[grunting]

07:51.672 --> 07:52.773
Bitch.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.742
Uhh!
You bitch.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.744
Why are you doing this to me?
Cuffs!

07:56.777 --> 07:58.045
Why are you doing this to me?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.013
You bitch!
I'll kill you!

08:00.047 --> 08:01.715
I'll kill you!

08:01.749 --> 08:03.551
You bitch!
Why are you doing this to me?!

08:03.584 --> 08:04.518
Why?!

08:04.552 --> 08:06.987
Why are you
doing this to me?!

08:07.020 --> 08:09.690
(Captain Pierce)
Only good thing about this is

08:09.723 --> 08:12.292
it didn't happen
in front of my squad.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.961
Well, you've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.696
You took a sucker punch
to the face,

08:15.729 --> 08:16.730
and you're still conscious.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.831
Where is he?

08:17.865 --> 08:21.702
Psych services says he might
need to be hospitalized.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.238
Could we be looking at some kind
of a combat stress situation?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.439
P.T.S.D.?

08:26.473 --> 08:29.543
Jamie's rape allegation seems
a lot more plausible now.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.545
Well, we're damn lucky
we didn't send him home.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.546
[knock on door]

08:32.580 --> 08:34.782
(Fin)
Cap, I.A.B.'s on the line.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.017
Woman called 911 said
her husband tried to rape her--

08:37.050 --> 08:38.819
He's holding her hostage
at gunpoint.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.921
He's a cop.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.693
[siren]

08:45.726 --> 08:47.828
(man)
Go away!

08:51.799 --> 08:54.968
Wes, let's go somewhere
and talk.

08:55.002 --> 08:55.969
Wes...

08:56.003 --> 08:57.905
just drop the gun,
all right?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.873
(man)
How did I let this happen?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.675
I'm not me, I'm not me.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.343
Where's Kendra, Wes?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.078
Huh?
Where's Anthony?

09:05.112 --> 09:08.982
I'm sorry...it's not me...
it's not me...it's not me...

09:09.016 --> 09:10.584
I'm sorry.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.220
Let them go.
It'll be you and me.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.789
Just us.
Like old times, okay?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.892
She's dead.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.831
What's wrong with me?!

09:23.864 --> 09:26.066
What did I do?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.641
(Anthony)
Dad?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.642
(officer)
Anthony.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.277
Go back inside.
Okay, buddy?

09:37.310 --> 09:39.880
Dad, where's Mom?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.950
Please. Anthony?
Go back inside.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.818
It's gonna be okay.
All right?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.086
He'll be all right.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.621
[whispering]
Go inside.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.823
Dad, what's wrong?
Are you mad at me?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.664
[gunshot]

09:56.697 --> 09:57.831
No.

09:57.865 --> 10:01.902
Dad?! Dad!
No, Daddy, no!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.771
Daddy! Daddy!

10:03.804 --> 10:05.939
No.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.741
Daddy...

10:12.980 --> 10:14.314
Officer's name is Wes Myers

10:14.347 --> 10:16.283
with Anti-Crime
at the 5-1 in the Bronx.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.319
He's in surgery, still alive.
Doc thinks he has a chance.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.921
The wife?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.423
Shot dead, point blank
to the back of the head.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.758
Kid's with A.C.S.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.293
Two cops,
two different precincts,

10:26.326 --> 10:27.761
they both attack their wives.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.897
Please tell me
there's some connection.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.065
Myers was on leave
until two days ago.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.433
Guess where he's been.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.837
Afghanistan.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.371
He just got back.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.942
You guys were partners?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.712
He was gonna take
a couple weeks off

10:44.745 --> 10:47.681
and then
come back to work.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.450
He was so happy that
the Reserve let him out early.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.854
Were Wes and his wife
having problems?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.324
No.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.960
This was a good family.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.128
Really close.

11:01.161 --> 11:05.999
It just doesn't
make any sense.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.269
Wes loved Kendra.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.904
This isn't him.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.810
(Cragen)
Well, somebody's
got a big mouth.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.711
It's already hit the papers.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.880
How the hell
did they get this so fast?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.749
No idea, but some writer
named Sherm Hempell's

11:21.782 --> 11:23.751
got some real specific
information.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.052
Take a look at this.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.319
Yeah, we've seen it.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.420
So has Arthur Branch.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.057
Meaning I'll be a special kind
of pain in your ass

11:30.090 --> 11:31.024
until this is sufficiently
explained.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.194
My money's on post-traumatic
stress disorder.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.996
Both men were in
the same Reserve unit,

11:36.029 --> 11:38.231
the 365th M.P. Brigade.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.500
It's out of Fort Crompton
in New Jersey.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.270
Yeah, most of
the reservists there are NYPD.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.404
But they didn't
know each other.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.472
And they didn't
serve together.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.841
Callahan served
a year in Afghanistan,

11:47.875 --> 11:50.377
got back eight months ago.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.212
Wes Myers got back
three days ago,

11:52.245 --> 11:53.847
but he only served
four months.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.849
All right, right there
that doesn't make sense.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.488
The military's keeping guys
double their initial deployment.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.858
Why did they let
Wes Myers out early?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.259
Maybe it's combat stress,
like you said.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.061
We don't even know
how much action they saw.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.529
Well, we can't ask Myers,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.999
he's still unconscious.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.033
But Callahan's under

12:13.066 --> 12:15.068
psych eval at N.Y.U.

12:15.102 --> 12:15.869
I'll call Huang,

12:15.903 --> 12:18.872
see if he can
make a diagnosis.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.476
(Callahan)
I've been having
all these dreams.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.546
About what?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.049
Weird stuff.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.419
People's faces
turning into monsters' faces.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.124
Spiders
coming out of my hands.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.260
How long have you
been having them?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.896
Started a couple of months
after I got back to the States.

12:42.930 --> 12:47.034
Freaks me out all day.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.069
I know that the doctors
had been giving you

12:49.102 --> 12:51.038
some medication.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.373
You think it's helping?
Yeah.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.277
The dreams aren't as bad.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.113
And I don't have
all that other crazy stuff

13:00.147 --> 13:03.416
in my head as much.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.385
What other crazy stuff?

13:08.255 --> 13:10.357
Like thinking that
my neighbors

13:10.390 --> 13:14.161
are spying on me.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.965
Tapping my phones.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.301
There's something
really wrong.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.313
How's Jamie?

13:33.346 --> 13:38.285
I haven't spoken to her.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.588
But...I could
contact her for you.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.156
After we're finished.

13:43.190 --> 13:47.294
If you'd like.

13:47.327 --> 13:51.064
She doesn't...come see me.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.535
She won't even call.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.141
Not that I blame her.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.176
I'm sure she's very
worried about you, Tom.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.611
Everyone is.

14:11.551 --> 14:15.188
What else have you noticed
about yourself?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.657
The things that you did
before you were hospitalized

14:17.690 --> 14:21.161
that don't make sense now?

14:21.194 --> 14:26.666
Sometimes in the morning
when I shave...

14:26.699 --> 14:30.370
I put the razor to my neck...

14:30.403 --> 14:33.440
and I think...

14:33.473 --> 14:38.645
if I could just push
a little bit harder...

14:38.678 --> 14:42.482
all the way across my throat...

14:45.318 --> 14:49.022
it would hardly hurt at all.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.195
I don't think it's P.T.S.D.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.629
Why not?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.331
Callahan reports no change

14:58.365 --> 15:00.433
in his sleep patterns
or eating habits.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.270
He exhibits no
exaggerated startle reflex.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.372
His nightmares
are vivid and bizarre,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.107
more like hallucinations.

15:07.140 --> 15:11.311
And he experiences paranoia
and suicidal ideation.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.446
So if it's not P.T.S.D.,
what is causing all this?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.714
Well, if this were
an isolated case,

15:14.747 --> 15:17.450
I'd say that
he might have developed

15:17.484 --> 15:19.219
schizo-affective disorder.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.154
Or it could be organic.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.655
A brain tumor,
for instance.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.556
(Stabler)
But it's not isolated.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.625
It's two different guys.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.360
What are the odds
they'd both come down

15:27.394 --> 15:28.528
with the same disorder?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.663
(Huang)
It's next to impossible.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.565
Which leaves us with
an environmental cause.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.735
Both soldiers affected
by the same toxin.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.604
Gulf War Syndrome has been
blamed on everything

15:37.637 --> 15:41.741
from chemical weapons
to depleted uranium bullets.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.676
Yeah, and the Marines
gave me a physical

15:43.710 --> 15:45.412
when I finished my tour.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.981
I'll bet the Army
does the same thing.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.553
(Dr. Trainer)
Actually, D.O.D. says
post-deployment physicals

15:53.586 --> 15:54.554
are optional for soldiers now.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.656
Did Wes Myers or Tom Callahan
opt to take one?

15:56.689 --> 15:57.757
No, Ma'am.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.527
Just filled out the required
health questionnaire.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.761
Either man
report any problems?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.563
Not a thing.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.332
Could we take a look
at the surveys?

16:05.365 --> 16:08.768
Can't make that call
for you, Detective.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.071
Have to take it up with
the unit commander.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.672
I'd like to cooperate,
Detectives,

16:12.705 --> 16:14.641
but I'm not authorized to
release any medical records.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.010
(Fin)
We could get both men
to waive their privacy rights.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.211
Not really the issue.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.679
You'd have to talk
to the local general.

16:19.712 --> 16:23.650
(Munch)
Ah, the wonderful world
of military bureaucracy.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.152
I hear you, Detective.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.619
I wish I could be more help.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.088
Callahan and Myers
were both good soldiers.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.256
Well, maybe you could tell us

16:29.289 --> 16:32.325
why Wes Myers only served
four months in Afghanistan.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.693
Unfortunately,
I can't do that either.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.728
And that is to protect
Myers' privacy.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.430
I'm very sorry.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.432
I think we're going about this
in the wrong way.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.734
Now why don't you tell us
what you can share with us.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.137
Well, frankly,
I wouldn't be surprised

16:44.171 --> 16:47.307
if this weren't some sort
of combat stress situation.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.243
A lot of men have a tough time
readjusting to civilian life.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.379
(Stabler)
Our shrink ruled out P.T.S.D.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.747
Both men
were hallucinating,

16:54.781 --> 16:56.249
uh, violent, suicidal.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.318
Any other symptoms?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.287
(Benson)
Vivid dreams, paranoia.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.390
Not to mention they both
attacked their wives.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.726
There's really nothing
I can do to help you.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.830
Sir. Sir.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.565
Look, I was in the Marines,

17:12.599 --> 17:14.734
so...I understand
the need for discretion,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.002
but we got a pattern here.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.638
Well, you'll have to take it up
with the Pentagon, detectives.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.740
I'm sorry.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.346
Right.
Now, is there anyone--

17:26.379 --> 17:30.183
That's what I'm saying.
I've already talked to him.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.284
Thanks.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.485
Come on, Elliot,
you're one of them.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.320
Won't someone in the military

17:33.353 --> 17:35.755
cooperate with
a Desert Storm vet?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.390
Look, I already
called the local general.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.392
Then his boss, then a bunch
of people in Washington.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.793
They're all just
passing the buck.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.529
Usually means
we're on the right track.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.630
(Benson)
I'd like another crack

17:43.663 --> 17:44.864
at the base doctor.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.399
I've got a feeling
he's got some idea

17:46.433 --> 17:47.400
what's going on here.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.801
(Cragen)
Elliot.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.838
Get online, check out
the Sentinel website.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.075
What are those
bottom feeders up to?

17:56.109 --> 17:58.511
(Cragen)
They just posted a preview
of tomorrow's headline.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.747
(Benson)
Wes Myers.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.815
Why call him a coward?

18:02.849 --> 18:05.218
He's been court-martialed
for cowardice.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.120
Refused a direct order?

18:07.154 --> 18:10.223
(Benson)
Same reporter, Sherm Hempell.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.825
You know, I'm sick of playing
catch-up with these tabloids.

18:12.859 --> 18:16.095
This guy is gonna
give up his inside source.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.871
What are you looking for?

18:24.904 --> 18:25.738
Press, okay?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.840
If it's in the trash,
it's fair game,

18:27.874 --> 18:28.841
so come on, back off.
Police.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.811
You know, sniffing through
the garbage there

18:31.844 --> 18:33.413
is the first step
down the long road

18:33.446 --> 18:35.215
to sexual perversion
and deviance, Sherm.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.450
[scoffs]
What do you want?

18:37.484 --> 18:38.451
(Benson)
Wes Myers.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.552
How did you find out

18:39.586 --> 18:40.587
about his court-martial?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.422
Inside source.
Yeah, how inside?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.756
Very.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.692
If you think I'm giving you
a name, you're on crack.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.759
I'm on what?

18:46.793 --> 18:50.597
Why don't you drop
the pretend police intimidation

18:50.630 --> 18:51.931
and try to save
a brother officer

18:51.964 --> 18:54.734
from yet another
government frame-up job?

18:54.767 --> 18:55.768
Meaning what?

18:55.802 --> 19:02.242
Meaning, you can't believe
everything you read.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.643
If it is a frame job,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.812
you're making it worse
by printing it in your paper.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.747
I print what I can
substantiate at the time.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.615
What does that mean?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.717
It only has to be true
for a second?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.252
Why do you think
Myers was framed?

19:12.285 --> 19:13.253
Ah, forget it.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.687
Oh, forget it?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.423
You think that little boy
is gonna forget

19:16.456 --> 19:17.857
how his father
murdered his mother?

19:17.890 --> 19:20.727
You think he's gonna
forget the day

19:20.760 --> 19:24.531
he lost his whole family?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.233
You know it stinks,

19:26.266 --> 19:29.236
or you wouldn't have
said anything.

19:29.269 --> 19:33.506
Just tell us
where to start looking.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.308
Here...

19:35.342 --> 19:37.644
Just give me a call
when you get a conscience.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.983
Start asking about Quinium.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.918
What's that?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.323
The new Agent Orange.
[cell phone rings]

19:50.357 --> 19:53.426
Stabler.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.568
How does someone on a lockdown
psych ward commit suicide?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.870
Run into a wall.
Head first.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.009
He did it twice.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.246
Second time broke his neck.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.516
You really gotta wanna die
to do it that way.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.918
No one in their right mind
wants this.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.755
Whoever this guy used to be,
he wasn't that man anymore.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.599
Colonel Gage's office
is directing all inquiries

20:32.632 --> 20:34.033
to the Judge Advocate General.

20:34.066 --> 20:34.967
And the stonewall begins.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.869
We don't even know
what we're asking about.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.805
Some reporter said Quinium.
That's all we've got.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.340
What is Quinium?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.708
It's an anti-malaria drug,

20:41.741 --> 20:43.009
but it also has a reputation

20:43.042 --> 20:44.644
for some pretty serious
side effects.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.613
I found hundreds
of message boards

20:46.646 --> 20:48.715
alleging anything
from nightmares and paranoia

20:48.748 --> 20:49.882
to psychotic behavior
and suicide.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.984
Sounds familiar.

20:52.018 --> 20:52.919
(Munch)
It should.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.322
You remember
that string of Army murders

20:55.355 --> 20:56.756
in the summer of 2002?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.558
Yeah, they all happened
on the same base, right?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.759
Four soldiers
had killed their wives

20:59.792 --> 21:01.528
within a six-week period.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.062
Three of them subsequently
took their own lives,

21:03.095 --> 21:04.964
and at least two of them
had taken Quinium.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.165
(Stabler)
But in every one
of those cases,

21:06.198 --> 21:09.336
there were allegations of
marital problems and infidelity.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.803
Well, Elliot,
there's marital problems,

21:10.837 --> 21:12.439
and there's
stabbing your wife 70 times

21:12.472 --> 21:13.473
and setting her on fire.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.041
Do we know if Myers
or Callahan took Quinium?

21:15.074 --> 21:17.344
No, we don't,
and even if they did,

21:17.377 --> 21:19.712
why would the military
poison their own troops?

21:19.746 --> 21:21.013
Excellent question.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.949
I wondered the same thing
a couple of years ago,

21:22.982 --> 21:24.050
when the military
forced soldiers

21:24.083 --> 21:26.786
to take an experimental
anthrax vaccine.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.088
Even after people died,
they only stopped

21:29.121 --> 21:30.657
when a federal court
ordered them to.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.991
You're acting like
they were conducting tests

21:32.024 --> 21:33.393
against their own troops.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.729
They were protecting them
against disease.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.498
Is Quinium
an experimental drug?

21:38.531 --> 21:40.500
No, it has been
approved by FDA.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.335
However, they did
force a drug company

21:42.369 --> 21:44.637
to change the warnings
on the Quinium label twice

21:44.671 --> 21:45.805
in the last four years.

21:45.838 --> 21:49.308
I wonder why
they had to alter it.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.481
Millions of people
have taken Quinium

21:54.514 --> 21:56.115
with no ill effects,
Ms. Novak.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.484
It's a safe drug.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.618
Some people
claim otherwise.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.986
That's anecdotal evidence.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.589
Scientific tests
prove the drug is safe.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.823
Well, didn't the F.D.A.

22:03.856 --> 22:07.427
recently make you cite suicide
as a potential side effect?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.096
There is no scientific evidence
that Quinium causes suicide.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.432
Okay.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.667
But...it's on your label.
So why did you add it?

22:14.701 --> 22:17.470
The label is in full compliance
with federal law.

22:17.504 --> 22:21.073
I've got two Army Reservists,

22:21.107 --> 22:23.910
one dead, the other alive
but not for lack of trying.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.445
I'm simply asking
if they could have been

22:25.478 --> 22:26.446
under the influence
of a drug

22:26.479 --> 22:27.914
that you admit
has very serious side effects.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.383
Oh, well,
all drugs have side effects.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.119
I mean, even penicillin
can cause death.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.588
But the, uh, benefits
outweigh the risks.

22:35.622 --> 22:36.789
What's the cut-off then?

22:36.823 --> 22:39.492
I mean, how many people need
to commit suicide or murder

22:39.526 --> 22:40.593
before the risk
is too great?

22:40.627 --> 22:43.663
Can you prove these men
took Quinium?

22:43.696 --> 22:46.433
So we've gone
from "it's safe"

22:46.466 --> 22:48.000
to "it's within
federal compliance"

22:48.034 --> 22:49.469
to "they might not
have even taken it."

22:49.502 --> 22:52.505
This discussion is over.
[knock on door]

22:52.539 --> 22:54.474
I'm so sorry.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.544
Ms. Novak, the police called.
They said it was urgent.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.012
You can show
Ms. Novak out, Joanna.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.014
And I'll call
when I get your answer.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.050
To what?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.918
Whether or not
Wes Myers took Quinium.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.554
He's awake.

23:09.088 --> 23:14.694
It's...like a dream now.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.829
We're having dinner

23:16.863 --> 23:19.466
and Kendra's talking,

23:19.499 --> 23:21.501
and I get this
overwhelming feeling

23:21.534 --> 23:24.103
that she's having an affair
with this guy she works with.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.505
What, like a voice
in your head?

23:25.538 --> 23:28.040
No, but...

23:28.074 --> 23:30.142
I was so sure.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.078
I just started
screaming at her

23:32.111 --> 23:34.213
and chasing her
around the house.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.848
She locked herself
in the bedroom.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.686
I could hear...

23:39.719 --> 23:40.487
on the phone,

23:40.520 --> 23:43.690
I thought she was
talking to him.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.693
So...
I broke the door down.

23:46.726 --> 23:51.731
She was...
crying and...

23:51.764 --> 23:57.069
begging me not
to hurt Anthony.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.838
Officer Myers,

23:58.871 --> 24:01.240
did you ever take a drug
called Quinium?

24:01.273 --> 24:05.177
Yeah. Yeah.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.112
Manic Mondays.

24:06.145 --> 24:09.115
What's that?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.985
Every Monday,
some medic would stand

24:13.019 --> 24:15.988
at the end of the chow line
and give us a pill.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.658
A lot of guys
got really edgy.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.494
How did you feel
on manic Mondays?

24:21.528 --> 24:23.095
My bunk mate said I'd...

24:23.129 --> 24:25.131
jump on my cot...

24:25.164 --> 24:29.101
wave my gun around
and yell about insurgents.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.903
I don't remember any of it.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.205
Is that why
you were sent home?

24:33.239 --> 24:34.273
No.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.043
One day,
I just freaked out.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.978
I was afraid
to leave base camp.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.514
My C.O. said,

24:41.548 --> 24:44.250
"Get over it."

24:44.283 --> 24:45.918
Next thing I know,
they're shipping me home

24:45.952 --> 24:47.987
and calling me a coward.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.256
And they were right.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.124
Look at me.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.627
Look what I did.
I killed my wife.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.262
My son has nobody now.

24:56.295 --> 25:00.099
I deserve everything I get.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.367
(Novak)
If his story is true...

25:01.400 --> 25:04.804
It means the Army knew exactly
what Quinium could do to people

25:04.837 --> 25:07.674
and they handed it out
anyway.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.876
We can't put Wes Myers
in jail for murder.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.143
Who do I put in jail, then?

25:11.177 --> 25:12.311
The U.S. Army?
The drug company?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.780
The Army was responsible
for him.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.281
He trusted them,
he was betrayed.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.216
One could argue he didn't
have to take the drug.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.585
No, you don't understand.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.621
He didn't have a choice.

25:21.654 --> 25:22.755
You give up
everything for them.

25:22.789 --> 25:26.325
You leave your family for them
because you believe...

25:26.358 --> 25:29.295
it's you duty to the Corps
and to your country.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.298
And when
you come back home,

25:32.331 --> 25:33.933
you think it's gonna be
like it was before.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.335
But everyone's moved on
with their lives.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.839
You're never getting
that year back.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.675
Wes Myers has already
sacrificed his family once

25:42.709 --> 25:44.276
when he left them
for Afghanistan.

25:44.310 --> 25:48.881
He doesn't even
have a family now.

25:48.915 --> 25:52.084
He doesn't deserve that.

25:52.118 --> 25:55.655
He had a right to know
what Quinium might do to him.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.889
It's called informed consent.

25:56.923 --> 25:57.824
There was a risk,

25:57.857 --> 26:03.229
and that risk
was concealed by the Army.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.297
Look, I'm not gonna
charge the Pentagon

26:05.331 --> 26:06.365
for rape and murder,

26:06.398 --> 26:07.834
but I'd settle
for a good reason

26:07.867 --> 26:09.101
to plead Wes Myers out.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.338
Plus a way to get the military
to stop handing out that drug.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.741
I'm gonna need to talk to
your little reporter friend.

26:14.774 --> 26:18.277
I gave you guys a gift.
Now it's payback time.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.612
All of you on the record,

26:19.646 --> 26:21.013
everything you know
about Quinium.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.281
Well, we're still
in the dark there, Sherm.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.750
That's why we called you in.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.918
Mulder. Scully.

26:25.952 --> 26:26.953
Mr. Hempell,

26:26.986 --> 26:28.821
I'm gonna be
straight up with you.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.289
I like the First Amendment.
I'm a big fan.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.991
But I'm a bigger fan

26:32.024 --> 26:34.260
of preventing the unnecessary
deaths of U.S. soldiers.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.763
Imagine A.D.A. Novak
dragging you in front of a judge

26:36.796 --> 26:38.064
and uttering words
like "patriot,"

26:38.097 --> 26:40.266
"security,"
"homeland."

26:40.299 --> 26:41.133
(Benson)
You're a writer, Sherm.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.969
You know how powerful
words can be.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.237
So you would take advantage
of terrorism fears

26:45.271 --> 26:46.372
to circumvent
the Bill of Rights.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.374
That's, uh, despicable.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.909
(Stabler)
No more despicable
than writing stories

26:49.942 --> 26:51.410
you know are false
to sell a paper.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.412
I gave you guys a huge tip!

26:53.445 --> 26:54.546
Which we can't prove.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.717
Yeah, maybe the Army is right.
Maybe Quinium is safe.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.051
I've been saying that
all along.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.653
They would never knowingly
poison their own soldiers.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.221
Hey, Sparky!

27:02.254 --> 27:04.857
You remember that little spike
in military suicides in 2003?

27:04.891 --> 27:06.358
Guess what else
spiked that year?

27:06.392 --> 27:08.360
Number of Quinium prescriptions
the Pentagon wrote--

27:08.394 --> 27:11.363
over 35,000, highest number
since the war started.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.099
Lo and behold,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.234
they stop Quinium
in Iraq and Kuwait.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.903
That suicide rate,
it took a tumble.

27:16.936 --> 27:17.904
Is that a coincidence?

27:17.937 --> 27:18.905
(Munch)
Maybe.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.239
The military
started providing

27:20.272 --> 27:22.441
better mental health care
for their soldiers.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.176
That could've contributed
to the drop in suicides.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.713
Listen to what I'm saying.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.248
They only prescribe Quinium
in Afghanistan now.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.083
Why would they stop
in Iraq and Kuwait

27:31.117 --> 27:32.384
if there was
nothing wrong with it?

27:32.418 --> 27:33.419
(Novak)
Well, you feel strongly
about this.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.722
Yes!
You want the truth
to come out.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.323
That is what
I'm trying to do!

27:37.356 --> 27:38.825
So are we, Mr. Hempell.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.326
So, I'm about to take on
the Department of Defense

27:40.359 --> 27:41.828
because I believe it is
the right thing to do.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.697
Now, you can either
stand aside and do nothing

27:44.731 --> 27:46.098
or you can help.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.200
Come on, Sherm.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.309
Check it out.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.445
See how far
the rabbit hole goes,

27:59.478 --> 28:01.113
as they say.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.787
It's called a matrix.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.356
Also known as a spreadsheet.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.759
Fort Crompton Quinium Adverse
Event Reporting Matrix.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.327
Soldiers'
serial numbers.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.329
Date of initial
drug administration.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.965
Date of first
adverse event.

28:18.998 --> 28:19.966
(Novak)
Event description.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.202
Abnormal dreams, depression,

28:23.235 --> 28:27.840
dizziness, panic attack,
nausea, tachycardia, psychosis.

28:27.874 --> 28:31.443
The Army kept records
of every single side effect.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.045
The data only
goes back three months.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.947
Where did you guys get this?

28:34.981 --> 28:37.316
You know, we can't even be sure
this is the real deal.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.819
Anyone
could have created this.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.053
This is real.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.155
Well, I can probably tell you
who modified the file last,

28:43.189 --> 28:44.423
if that helps.
Yeah, how?

28:44.456 --> 28:46.058
Well, if it's some kind
of internal file

28:46.092 --> 28:47.493
that multiple users access,

28:47.526 --> 28:49.395
there's usually
an electronic signature.

28:49.428 --> 28:53.099
There's the last person
who accessed the matrix.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.167
(Novak)
P. Trainer.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.368
That doctor at Fort Crompton.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.837
He wouldn't talk to us.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.206
He'll talk to me.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.543
I'm sorry, Ms. Novak,
I can't let you on base.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.913
Well, I have a meeting
with Dr. Trainer.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.114
Why don't you call him?
I just did.

29:08.147 --> 29:11.250
He said he can only treat
Army personnel, not civilians.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.351
No, no, that's a mistake.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.553
There's not mistake, Ma'am.
He left this for you.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.554
Some referrals
for other doctors.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.890
I don't need referrals
for other doctors, I--

29:17.924 --> 29:19.058
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.560
You're gonna have
to move it along.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.062
Have a nice day.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.098
You're not even--

29:42.314 --> 29:43.582
(Dr. Trainer)
You can't come to the base,

29:43.615 --> 29:46.485
or my house, or attempt
to contact me again.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.154
Is that clear?

29:48.187 --> 29:50.156
All right.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.258
How do you usually meet
with Sherm Hempell?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.161
He didn't tell us.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.428
We figured it out.

29:56.462 --> 30:00.066
I can't help you,
Ms. Novak.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.470
This wasn't supposed to
go this far.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.305
I believe this has gone
exactly as far

30:06.338 --> 30:08.207
as you've allowed,
Dr. Trainer.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.609
You contacted the press.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.111
You know what's happening
is wrong,

30:12.144 --> 30:15.214
but you're not in a position
to change anything.

30:15.247 --> 30:19.185
I am.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.688
Over the past three years,

30:22.721 --> 30:25.557
I've taken care of eight men
with damage to their brain stem,

30:25.591 --> 30:27.426
resulting in
balance disorders,

30:27.459 --> 30:30.162
as well as a host of
psychological side effects.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.499
Some served in Afghanistan,
some in Iraq, some in Kuwait.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.102
Their medical histories
have only one thing in common.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.971
They all took Quinium.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.539
Some of these men
stopped taking the drug

30:40.572 --> 30:42.441
months before
they developed problems.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.642
And because many of
the side effects

30:43.675 --> 30:46.112
are psychiatric in nature,
few sought help.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.579
Why not?

30:47.613 --> 30:50.049
There's no confidentiality
in the Army.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.317
You seek mental health care,

30:51.350 --> 30:52.484
that goes on
your permanent record.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.552
It's a sign of weakness.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.520
And weak minds
don't get promoted.

30:54.553 --> 30:58.090
The Army knows about
Quinium's side effects.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.625
They've known since Somalia.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.594
Then why continue to use it?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.196
In Afghanistan,

31:04.230 --> 31:06.332
there's a deadly resistant
strain of malaria.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.901
Of the four drugs that work,
three need to be taken daily.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.669
Quinium is once-a-week dose.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.438
Easier to make sure
soldiers take it.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.906
When they're not
killing themselves.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.042
The rear echelon
considers cost benefit.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.277
Thousands of dead soldiers
from malaria?

31:18.310 --> 31:19.946
Or the few who have
a bad reaction?

31:19.979 --> 31:20.947
Plus, the spouses they kill.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.548
Plus the assaults or rapes

31:22.581 --> 31:24.183
committed under
the influence of the drug.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.684
I'm not defending
their position, Ms. Novak.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.219
I'm simply explaining
the situation

31:27.253 --> 31:30.957
so you understand it.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.159
Can you get me more
Adverse Event Reports

31:33.192 --> 31:34.326
going back
further in history?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.628
You have everything I have.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.698
All right, then I'll just have
to subpoena them from JAG.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.968
I'll need to know what other
documents to subpoena.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.669
I sincerely doubt the Army
will be forthcoming

31:43.702 --> 31:44.503
unless I'm specific.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.505
What do you play
to do with all this?

31:46.538 --> 31:48.240
File criminal charges.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.509
Ms. Novak, you're overestimating
your authority.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.179
As far as the D.O.D.
is concerned, you have none.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.680
But I have you
and your testimony will--

31:54.713 --> 31:56.582
You absolutely do not
have me.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.649
I'm not testifying.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.651
I never agreed to that.

31:59.685 --> 32:03.155
My career would be over.

32:03.189 --> 32:06.225
You arranged a meeting with
an Assistant District Attorney.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.994
You never asked to speak
off the record.

32:08.027 --> 32:12.498
You never even changed
out of your uniform.

32:12.531 --> 32:16.502
Are you really that concerned
about ruining your career?

32:16.535 --> 32:20.139
Because this doesn't seem like
the career you wanted anyway.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.145
Casualty lists.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.080
Deployment lists.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.283
Adverse Event Reports
with names,

32:31.317 --> 32:33.152
not serial numbers.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.454
Raw data from the current
Pentagon Quinium study.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.059
What the hell is all this?

32:40.092 --> 32:42.061
U.S. Army's version
of burying me in paper.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.329
Their response to my subpoenas.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.531
These are food service
orders.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.465
Why would
you subpoena these?

32:46.498 --> 32:49.135
I didn't.
I request about 50 documents.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.302
They're somewhere
in these boxes.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.703
You gotta dig 'em out.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.605
Mm-hmm, law says they have
to turn the materials over.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.641
Doesn't say their filing system
has to be efficient.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.244
How long is it gonna take
to find what you need?

32:58.277 --> 32:59.645
Considering there are about
300 more boxes

32:59.678 --> 33:01.580
in the conference room,
and the D.A.'s office

33:01.613 --> 33:03.015
doesn't have the budget
to hire help,

33:03.049 --> 33:04.716
I'd say a couple of years.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.685
You're taking this
awfully well.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.754
I have no intention of letting
them get away with this.

33:08.787 --> 33:09.788
I'm convening a grand jury.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.623
For what?

33:11.657 --> 33:13.459
Indict the U.S. Army
for rape and murder.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.795
Casey, that's insane.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.497
I know I'm not gonna get
an indictment.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.798
I just want someone
to pay attention.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.767
Think this'll do the trick?

33:21.800 --> 33:24.770
Conference room, now.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.372
What was that about?

33:26.405 --> 33:29.275
That's probably just about
another subpoena I sent out.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.642
(Stabler)
For what?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.644
Donald Rumsfeld.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.816
You're gonna fix it,
and that's the end of the story!

33:37.849 --> 33:38.817
(Novak)
Fix what, sir?

33:38.850 --> 33:39.918
Oh, I don't know.

33:39.951 --> 33:41.720
Maybe calling the Secretary
of Defense a murderer?

33:41.753 --> 33:42.788
I didn't do that.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.190
Do I need to remind you

33:44.223 --> 33:47.226
that I've been known
to fire people, Casey?

33:47.259 --> 33:50.062
The Pentagon knowingly
administered an agent

33:50.096 --> 33:52.398
that causes violent
psychotic behavior.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.166
And they've subsequently chosen
to conceal that fact.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.202
Then why don't we get
a U.S. Attorney

33:56.235 --> 33:58.170
to whip up a RICO charge
while we're at it?

33:58.204 --> 33:59.538
Not a bad idea.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.207
[chuckles]

34:01.240 --> 34:02.708
I always like to hear about

34:02.741 --> 34:05.177
these nefarious forces
inside our government

34:05.211 --> 34:08.280
who inexplicably committed
these wicked acts.

34:08.314 --> 34:11.117
That's a great way to avoid
using logic.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.684
And it must be very cozy

34:12.718 --> 34:15.221
in your Upper West Side
apartment,

34:15.254 --> 34:16.555
sipping chardonnay
with your friends

34:16.588 --> 34:18.690
and talking about how evil
the military is,

34:18.724 --> 34:21.160
while young men and women are
getting blown to smithereens

34:21.193 --> 34:22.661
by car bombs.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.396
I'm gonna have to object
to any insinuation

34:24.430 --> 34:27.266
that I'm somehow anti-military
or anti-troops.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.401
My father was a door gunner
on a Huey in Vietnam.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.737
He was in three chopper crashes,
and he got the Purple Heart.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.539
Listen,
I support our troops.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.574
And that's why
I wanna stop the Pentagon

34:35.607 --> 34:38.510
from prescribing
a pill that could kill them.

34:38.544 --> 34:39.778
Sir.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.682
What you're suggesting

34:43.715 --> 34:46.352
doesn't make any sense,
Casey.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.487
Now, the armed forces
may be many things,

34:48.520 --> 34:51.590
but one of the things
that they're not is inefficient.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.159
Now, there's no reason
to believe

34:53.192 --> 34:55.227
that they would operate
against their own self-interest

34:55.261 --> 34:56.595
and administer a drug

34:56.628 --> 35:00.199
that would render their
own soldiers unfit to fight.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.833
Quinium is very efficient.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.303
And most people experience
minimal side effects.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.604
But the Army
is about numbers.

35:05.637 --> 35:06.838
Some soldiers
are gonna die.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.240
And whether they die
by getting

35:08.274 --> 35:10.176
blown up by a bomb
or taking a pill,

35:10.209 --> 35:13.179
at the end of the day,
it's just another dead soldier.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.780
And they're gonna get more.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.348
The Army could have
prevented this.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.217
They chose not to.
That's your opinion.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.786
Would you take Quinium?

35:22.954 --> 35:26.192
Would you
let your grandchild?

35:26.225 --> 35:29.228
Sir, I won't convene
an indicting grand jury.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.163
I'll convene
an investigating one.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.398
Let them hear the evidence

35:32.431 --> 35:34.600
and decide if anyone's
criminally responsible.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.706
This is not going to end
the way you want it to.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.311
But all right.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.913
You've got your grand jury.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.482
Now, would you please inform
the Secretary of Defense

35:50.516 --> 35:52.851
that his presence will not
be required?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.924
Mr. Koehler, your company
sponsored a study

35:58.957 --> 36:00.692
of the side effects of Quinium.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.694
Can you tell me
what the results were?

36:02.728 --> 36:04.396
Well, the study determined

36:04.430 --> 36:07.733
that only 1 in 10,000
people who take Quinium

36:07.766 --> 36:10.236
experience
serious side effects.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.238
The grand jury has examined
this British report

36:12.271 --> 36:15.374
that was published three years
after your study.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.276
You aware of it?

36:17.309 --> 36:18.777
Somewhat.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.279
Then you're aware
that they claim

36:20.312 --> 36:23.315
1 in 140 people experience
side effects.

36:23.349 --> 36:26.552
I can't comment
on their scientific accuracy

36:26.585 --> 36:28.220
or inaccuracy.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.455
Well, the grand jury
has also reviewed

36:29.488 --> 36:30.556
this warning pamphlet
for Quinium.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.723
Why did your company
produce this?

36:31.757 --> 36:34.660
Well, the Food and Drug
Administration

36:34.693 --> 36:36.628
asked us to.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.797
Would you be surprised
to hear that fewer than

36:38.830 --> 36:41.367
20 other prescription drugs
have been mandated by the FDA

36:41.400 --> 36:42.701
to issue such a warning?

36:42.734 --> 36:46.705
We are happy to comply
with any FDA instructions.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.775
And those instructions include
that everyone who takes Quinium

36:49.808 --> 36:51.343
be given this pamphlet,
is that correct?

36:51.377 --> 36:53.445
Yes.

36:53.479 --> 36:56.582
Does the Army give
this pamphlet to its soldiers?

36:56.615 --> 36:57.983
Not that I'm aware.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.718
But you've taken
Quinium yourself,

36:59.751 --> 37:01.320
and you've never seen
this pamphlet.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.788
(Koehler)
That's correct.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.790
The grand jury has subpoenaed
the casualty list

37:04.823 --> 37:08.627
for the 365th MP Brigade,
covering the last three years.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.630
Now, according to this list,
there is one death by suicide.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.698
That's correct.

37:12.731 --> 37:13.932
Now, did this soldier
take Quinium?

37:13.965 --> 37:14.933
He did.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.302
But a lot of the men

37:16.335 --> 37:17.503
in your unit
have taken the drug.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.272
And in the last three years,
only one has killed himself.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.374
Is that right?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.942
Yes, it is.

37:23.975 --> 37:28.547
I count four instances
of "death by misadventure."

37:28.580 --> 37:30.416
What does that mean?

37:30.449 --> 37:32.784
It's a broad term referring
to an accidental death.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.621
For instance, a man may drown
or fall and break his neck.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.457
What does it mean
when the cause of death

37:38.490 --> 37:40.926
says "pending investigation"?

37:40.959 --> 37:42.994
If the cause of death
isn't immediately apparent,

37:43.028 --> 37:45.431
the Army attempts
to determine how he died.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.333
And "weapons misfire"?
Exactly like it sounds?

37:47.366 --> 37:48.534
Yes, ma'am.
It happens.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.569
Now, have you ever heard
of soldiers who,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.371
in an effort to protect
their friends

37:52.404 --> 37:53.505
or the families
of their friends,

37:53.539 --> 37:56.375
will conceal a suicide
by claiming a weapons misfire

37:56.408 --> 37:57.676
or accidental death?

37:57.709 --> 38:00.879
I don't know of any
specific instances

38:00.912 --> 38:02.414
where that has happened.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.416
But it is possible.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.317
I suppose.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.519
Meaning that it's possible
in your unit

38:07.553 --> 38:09.087
or the entire armed forces

38:09.120 --> 38:10.422
there are more suicides

38:10.456 --> 38:13.792
than actually
on record.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.928
Anything is possible,
Ms. Novak.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.435
(Novak)
Will you state and profession
for the grand jury?

38:23.469 --> 38:25.737
Dr. Paul Trainer, Captain,
United States Army.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.740
And you also run the base clinic
at Fort Crompton?

38:28.774 --> 38:29.875
Correct.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.378
Have you treated any soldiers
with brain stem damage?

38:32.411 --> 38:33.345
I have.

38:33.379 --> 38:36.482
And to what did you
attribute that damage?

38:36.515 --> 38:38.384
Unknown etiology.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.590
I beg your pardon.

38:44.623 --> 38:48.427
Unknown etiology.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.096
Meaning their disorders
were caused by factors

38:51.129 --> 38:53.565
that cannot be
scientifically determined.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.937
Dr. Trainer, are you denying
that you previously stated

38:58.970 --> 39:02.508
Quinium exposure
caused brain stem damage

39:02.541 --> 39:03.575
in eight of your patients?

39:03.609 --> 39:05.544
I am amending my diagnosis.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.413
Did you not say
that the only common factor

39:07.446 --> 39:10.048
among all eight men
was Quinium exposure?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.551
I subsequently learned

39:12.584 --> 39:14.420
that there were
other risk factors.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.555
Other risk factors?
What? Such as--

39:16.588 --> 39:18.557
Jet fuel exposure.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.125
Head injury, noise.

39:20.158 --> 39:23.429
Noise?
Caused a brain stem injury?

39:23.462 --> 39:25.697
There is no way to make
a definitive diagnosis,

39:25.731 --> 39:26.965
which is why I said--

39:26.998 --> 39:30.035
Unknown etiology.
I remember.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.938
Do you believe Quinium
to be a safe drug?

39:32.971 --> 39:35.106
Ms. Novak, what we
have not discussed

39:35.140 --> 39:38.176
is the fact that malaria
is a highly deadly disease.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.614
It kills over 2 million people
worldwide every year.

39:42.648 --> 39:45.617
Every 12 seconds
a child dies from malaria.

39:47.453 --> 39:50.556
That's very sad,
Dr. Trainer.

39:50.589 --> 39:54.025
You didn't even attempt
to answer my question.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.395
Is Quinium safe?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.736
All reliable
scientific evidence

40:04.770 --> 40:06.905
says that it is.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.083
What did they do?

40:18.116 --> 40:19.585
What are you talking about?

40:19.618 --> 40:21.219
They threaten you?
Your family?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.188
You've seen too many movies,
Ms. Novak.

40:23.221 --> 40:24.355
You sat there
and lied under oath,

40:24.389 --> 40:27.526
and you expect me to believe
that you weren't coerced?

40:27.559 --> 40:29.728
I'm acting under
my own free will.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.730
And not a word
I said was untrue.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.732
We had a shot
at changing things--

40:33.765 --> 40:36.602
of making them listen,
making them stop.

40:36.635 --> 40:40.105
I don't understand why
you didn't come to me.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.708
I could have helped you.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.643
And when the truth
came out,

40:44.676 --> 40:47.746
they never could have
touched you.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.521
Ms. Novak,
you are very young.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.223
And that is not
the way the world works.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.801
It's over?

41:09.835 --> 41:11.503
Don't mean
to disappoint you,

41:11.537 --> 41:12.904
but you're not getting
your scoop tonight.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.607
I'm here for moral support.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.208
No, for real.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.710
Moral support.

41:18.744 --> 41:21.046
That's nice.
Thanks.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.648
So what does
the jury report say?

41:22.681 --> 41:25.851
Well, Tommy Callahan and
Wes Myers are criminally liable

41:25.884 --> 41:27.986
for rape and murder,
respectively.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.621
No criminal liability

41:29.655 --> 41:30.856
for either Lifshin Forner
Pharmaceuticals

41:30.889 --> 41:33.224
or the U.S. Army,
although the jury believes

41:33.258 --> 41:35.293
that the matter
deserves further inquiry.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.664
Well...I mean,
that's something.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.765
[scoffs]

41:39.798 --> 41:42.868
Not really.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.836
At least Branch let me
cut a deal with Myers.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.672
So he'll be
in a mental health facility

41:46.705 --> 41:47.939
for at least a year,
and then...

41:47.973 --> 41:49.808
we'll see.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.578
No telling how long
the effects will last.

41:52.611 --> 41:55.614
Or who else is next.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.789
How many of them?
