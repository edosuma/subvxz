ARE YOU SAYING THAT 16 WOMEN
WERE KILLED IN THERE?

09:34.443 --> 09:36.837
NO. 15 OF THEM WERE WOMEN.
ONE OF THEM WAS A MAN.

HIS NAME'S
ALEXANDER LARK.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.710
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
HE MIGHT BE ANOTHER VICTIM,

09:40.710 --> 09:41.972
BUT HE WAS
NEVER REPORTED MISSING.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.713

HE WAS INVOLVED?

THAT CARVED UP THESE WOMEN.

WENT TO LARK'S HOUSE,

FIND ANYTHING.
