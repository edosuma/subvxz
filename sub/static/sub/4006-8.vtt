13:21.125 --> 13:24.959
[gunshots]

13:26.291 --> 13:28.041
[engine roars]

13:28.041 --> 13:30.667
[tires screeching]

13:30.667 --> 13:33.291
- WHAT THE HELL?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.125
- THOSE FUCKING GANG KIDS
ARE AT IT AGAIN.

13:36.125 --> 13:39.375
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.250
[keys jingle]

13:45.166 --> 13:46.959
- LOOKS LIKE WHILE YOU WERE
PLAYING HOUSE WITH HANNAH,

13:46.959 --> 13:48.667
ISAAK FOUND A WAY
TO SHAKE THE POLICE,

13:48.667 --> 13:51.375
WHICH LIKELY MEANS
HE'LL COME AFTER YOU AGAIN.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.542
- WELL, IF HE CAN GET PAST
MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE, SO CAN I.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.834
- GRANDPA'S GONE TO SURGERY.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.917
GRANDMA SAYS WE HAVE
TO STAY WITH YOU IN MIAMI.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.542
- OH, SHIT.
- WHAT?

13:59.542 --> 14:00.500
- THE KIDS ARE COMING.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.750
- "KIDS" AS IN PLURAL?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.208
- GRANDPA HAS TO HAVE SURGERY.

14:05.208 --> 14:08.166
I NEED TO SEND JAMIE
TO ORLANDO TO PICK THEM UP.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.291
[line ringing]
[sighs]

14:15.291 --> 14:18.333
- IT WAS ISAAK, WASN'T IT?

14:18.333 --> 14:20.125
HOW THE FUCK DID HE GET AWAY
FROM THE COPS?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.917
- DOES IT MATTER?

14:21.917 --> 14:23.083
- DID YOU SEE HIM?

14:23.083 --> 14:24.333
- [grunts] YEAH.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.250
- THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING WITNESS.
I CAN ARREST HIM.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.291
- YOU ALREADY
TRIED THAT ONCE, DEB.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.792
IT DIDN'T WORK.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.333
YOU REALLY WANT
AN INVESTIGATION

14:31.333 --> 14:34.000
INTO WHY ISAAK SIRKO
IS TRYING TO KILL ME?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.166
- SO WHAT THE FUCK
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.291
- JUST LET ME HANDLE IT.

14:38.291 --> 14:41.542
- IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

14:41.542 --> 14:43.375
JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

14:43.375 --> 14:44.542
- THERE'S ONE OTHER THING.

14:44.542 --> 14:47.667
I GOT A CALL
FROM THE KIDS' GRANDMOTHER.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.667
- HARRISON OKAY?
- YEAH, HE'S FINE.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.291
BUT BILL HAS TO HAVE
EMERGENCY SURGERY,

14:52.291 --> 14:54.875
AND MAURA WANTS ME
TO WATCH HARRISON

14:54.875 --> 14:57.583
AND ASTOR AND CODY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.709
- NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.
- I KNOW, BUT WHAT COULD I SAY?

14:59.709 --> 15:01.750
JAMIE'S ON HER WAY
TO PICK THEM UP.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.166
- WELL THEY CAN'T STAY
AT YOUR FUCKING APARTMENT.

15:03.166 --> 15:06.417
ISAAK PROBABLY HAS
HIS OWN KEY BY NOW.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.583
- [sighs]
ANY IDEAS?

15:08.583 --> 15:11.834
- [sighs]

15:11.834 --> 15:15.125
YEAH, THEY CAN STAY
AT MY PLACE.

15:15.125 --> 15:18.959
I'LL GET PATROL CARS
TO COVER MY HOUSE, JUST IN CASE.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.291
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA
EXPLAIN THAT TO LAGUERTA?

15:22.291 --> 15:25.792
- I'LL TELL HER THAT I'M AFRAID
ISAAK'S GONNA COME AFTER ME

15:25.792 --> 15:28.291
FOR HIS ARREST.

15:28.291 --> 15:31.000
- YOUR HOUSE
ISN'T EXACTLY KID-FRIENDLY.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.834
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- WELL, YOU HAVE A GUN.

15:33.834 --> 15:35.083
- I'LL LOCK IT UP.

15:35.083 --> 15:39.750
- AND THE PAY CHANNELS.
CODY'S 12.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.333
- OKAY, I'LL LOCK UP THE REMOTE.
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:42.333 --> 15:46.083
- ANYTHING IN YOUR KITCHEN
BESIDES SALSA AND BEER?

15:46.083 --> 15:47.625
- I THINK THERE WAS SOME CHEESE
WHEN I MOVED IN.

15:47.625 --> 15:51.542
- I'LL HAVE JAMIE
STOCK THE FRIDGE.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.291
- [sighs]
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

15:53.291 --> 15:56.208
I LOVE KIDS.

15:56.208 --> 16:00.959
I DON'T LOVE KIDS IN GENERAL,
BUT I LOVE YOUR KIDS.

16:00.959 --> 16:04.458
AND ASTOR AND CODY,
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

16:04.458 --> 16:05.917
- I'LL GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP
AS SOON AS I KNOW

16:05.917 --> 16:07.458
WHEN THEY'RE GETTING IN.
THANKS.

16:07.458 --> 16:10.500
- YEAH.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.000
- WHAT'S THAT?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.375
- I'M GONNA PAY HANNAH MCKAY
A VISIT.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.625
- WHY?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.875
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GONNA DO WHAT YOU DO

16:18.875 --> 16:23.875
DOESN'T MEAN SHE GETS TO LIVE
HAPPILY FUCKING EVER AFTER.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.125
- I GUESS IT WAS FOOLISH
TO THINK

16:25.125 --> 16:27.583
DEB WOULD SIMPLY
WALK AWAY FROM THIS.

16:27.583 --> 16:32.000
[office chatter,
phone ringing]

16:32.000 --> 16:33.041
- HEY!

16:33.041 --> 16:35.125
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR DONUT SHOP.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.000
- OH, YEAH.
PRETTY SCARY.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.125
FRANCISCO THINKS
IT WAS GANG-RELATED.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.667
- SHOWDOWN BETWEEN
THE CRULLERS AND THE FRITTERS?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.000
[laughs]
- UH, DEB?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.500
IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE ON MY CELL PHONE.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.834
- SOMETHING UP?

16:47.834 --> 16:49.375
- JUST SOME BUSINESS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.583
- DEXTER.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.625
LADIES.

16:52.625 --> 16:56.083
IF YOU GET A CHANCE,
STOP BY PAPA'S AFTER WORK TODAY.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.291
IT'S UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.

16:57.291 --> 16:59.834
- SHUT THE FUCK UP.
YOU GOT THE RESTAURANT?

16:59.834 --> 17:02.375
- THE LANDLORD AND I CAME
TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE LEASE.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.291
CALL ME PAPA.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.500
- [laughs]
NO, I WILL NOT DO THAT.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.500
BUT I WILL STOP BY
FOR A DRINK LATER.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.000
- DEX, YOU'RE IN?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.375
- NO, I'VE GOT THE KIDS
COMING INTO TOWN, SO...

17:10.375 --> 17:14.500
- IT'S A FAMILY PLACE.
BRING 'EM.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.542
- ANGEL...

17:18.750 --> 17:21.417
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

17:21.417 --> 17:25.375
- 1 CUBIC YARD
OF COCOA MULCH.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.959
25 POUNDS OF--

17:27.959 --> 17:31.250
UH, LET ME GET BACK TO YOU.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.583
[beep]
LIEUTENANT.

17:34.583 --> 17:37.750
YOU, UH, IN THE MARKET
FOR SOME ORCHIDS?

17:37.750 --> 17:41.083
- I'M NOT BUYING ANYTHING
FROM YOU.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.041
- LOOK, I THINK YOU HAVE
THE WRONG IDEA--

17:42.041 --> 17:44.542
- SHUT UP.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN

17:44.542 --> 17:48.375
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY,
'CAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR.

17:48.375 --> 17:52.000
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.125
- WELL, I THINK
YOU'D BE SURPRISED

17:53.125 --> 17:55.959
AT THE THINGS THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

17:55.959 --> 17:59.166
- SAL PRICE
SHARED EVERYTHING WITH ME.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.750
SO YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE SAFER
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD,

18:00.750 --> 18:02.875
BUT ACTUALLY, IT'S WORSE.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.291
HE WAS JUST A WRITER.
I'M A COP.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.917
WHATEVER YOU'RE HIDING,
I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.375
- SAL PRICE
WAS A STORYTELLER.

18:08.375 --> 18:09.667
HE WANTED TO SELL BOOKS.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.375
HE DIDN'T CARE
IF THEY WERE TRUE OR NOT.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.583
- YOU ADMITTED TO HIM
ON TAPE

18:13.583 --> 18:16.208
THAT YOU KILLED
WITH WAYNE.

18:16.208 --> 18:19.250
HOW CONVENIENT THAT HE DIED
BEFORE HE HAD A CHANCE

18:19.250 --> 18:20.750
TO WRITE ABOUT IT.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.041
- LIEUTENANT,
WHAT WERE YOU DOING

18:22.041 --> 18:25.083
WHEN YOU WERE 15 YEARS OLD?
- [exhales sharply]

18:25.083 --> 18:26.625
- I'M GUESSING
YOU WERE PROBABLY

18:26.625 --> 18:28.625
ON A SOCCER TEAM
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

18:28.625 --> 18:29.917
ME?

18:29.917 --> 18:33.041
I WAS JUST SOME DUMB FARM GIRL
WHO WAS WAKENED

18:33.041 --> 18:34.875
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
BY AN OLDER BOY

18:34.875 --> 18:40.083
THAT I HAD A CRUSH ON
WHO SAID, "LET'S GO ON A TRIP."

18:40.083 --> 18:43.709
I WAS IN OVER MY HEAD.

18:43.709 --> 18:47.333
- YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WERE DOING THEN.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.458
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD NOW.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.959
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY I CARE
SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK,

18:52.959 --> 18:56.125
BUT SOMEHOW I DO,
SO, I'M SORRY.

18:56.125 --> 19:00.250
- YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN
TO BE SORRY.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.417
- I'M NOT SUGGESTING
A COUP HERE.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.417
MORE LIKE A REALIGNMENT.

19:14.417 --> 19:18.125
I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING WITHOUT
THE SUPPORT OF THE BROTHERHOOD,

19:18.125 --> 19:21.333
BUT I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING
HAS TO BE DONE

19:21.333 --> 19:25.750
OR THIS WHOLE THING'S
GONNA EXPLODE IN OUR FACES.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.250
OKAY.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.583
CONSIDER IT DONE.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.375
[beep]

19:50.000 --> 19:52.750
- YOU WANT TO STICK AROUND?
WATCH YOUR GIRL?

19:52.750 --> 19:53.917
DRINKS ON ME.

19:53.917 --> 19:55.333
- I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.834
WHY DON'T YOU
GO FUCK YOURSELF?

19:56.834 --> 19:59.291
- AH, COME ON, JOEY.

19:59.291 --> 20:02.125
- NAH, DON'T
"COME ON, JOEY" ME.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.375
WE HAD A DEAL,
AND YOU FUCKED ME OVER.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.959
SO WE'RE DONE.

20:05.959 --> 20:09.000
- LOOK, I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
GET YOU NADIA'S PASSPORT.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.917
I TRIED, MAN,
BUT THE GUYS IN KIEV,

20:10.917 --> 20:13.291
THEY PULL THE STRINGS.

20:13.291 --> 20:16.041
WHAT I DO HAVE IS SOME CASH.

20:16.041 --> 20:18.542
IF YOU DO
ONE MORE JOB FOR ME,

20:18.542 --> 20:20.250
YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING
FOR NADIA.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.166
- SEE, I DON'T WANT
YOUR FUCKING CASH.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.000
AND IF YOU TAKE THAT
OUT ON HER,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.500
I'LL HAVE I.C.E. DOWN HERE
FASTER THAN YOU CAN COUNT,

20:27.500 --> 20:30.542
CHECKING ON THE IMMIGRATION
STATUS OF ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES.

20:30.542 --> 20:31.709
SO GO FUCK YOURSELF.

20:31.709 --> 20:33.583
BYE.
[tires screeching]

20:33.583 --> 20:35.667
- MIAMI METRO BELIEVES
THEY KNOW WHERE ISAAK IS

20:35.667 --> 20:37.500
AT ALL TIMES,
BUT OBVIOUSLY

20:37.500 --> 20:40.333
I CAN'T COUNT ON THAT.

20:42.583 --> 20:45.208
HOPE HE ENJOYS HIS LAST MEAL.

20:45.208 --> 20:48.125
WHEN HE GETS HOME TO VIKTOR'S
APARTMENT, I'LL BE WAITING.

20:48.125 --> 20:51.625
[phone ringing]

20:51.625 --> 20:53.625
[beep]
HEY, JAMIE.

20:53.625 --> 20:54.709
- HEY, DEX.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.083
WE JUST MADE
A QUICK PIT STOP.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.000
I WARNED CODY
ABOUT THE BIG GULP,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.208
BUT WE'RE ABOUT
THREE HOURS OUT

21:01.208 --> 21:03.417
DEPENDING ON TRAFFIC.
- GREAT.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.750
WHY DON'T WE MEET AT
YOUR BROTHER'S NEW RESTAURANT?

21:05.750 --> 21:08.417
- IF HE'S GOT MACARONI
AND CHEESE, WE'LL BE FINE.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.834
APPARENTLY THAT'S ALL
HARRISON'S WILLINGLY CONSUMED

21:10.834 --> 21:12.583
SINCE HE GOT TO ORLANDO.

21:12.583 --> 21:13.917
- IT IS HIS FAVORITE.

21:13.917 --> 21:15.834
- GOD, CODY, WE DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO STOP AGAIN.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.250
- BUT I'M THIRSTY.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.625
- [sighs] CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE
HIM BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD?

21:18.625 --> 21:19.959
- NO, ASTOR,

21:19.959 --> 21:23.000
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM
BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.166
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
YOUR HANDS FULL.

21:25.166 --> 21:28.166
- WE'LL SEE YOU
IN MIAMI, DEXTER.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.250
- DRIVE SAFE.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.000
[beep]

21:33.000 --> 21:34.917
[engine turns over]

21:37.625 --> 21:41.250
[lockpick scratching,
door unlocks]

21:47.333 --> 21:49.959
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY
THEY'D LIKE TO DIE AT HOME.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.125
I'LL LEAVE HIS BODY HERE

21:52.125 --> 21:57.417
AND LET THE POLICE BLAME IT
ON THE COLOMBIANS.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.625
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

22:08.625 --> 22:11.000
- I'M THE BUILDING SUPER.
I CAME TO FIX THE FAUCET.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.166
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYONE WAS HOME.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.041
- YOU'RE NOT THE SUPER.

22:17.041 --> 22:19.583
- SURE I AM.
WHO ARE YOU?

22:19.583 --> 22:20.709
[gun readies]

22:20.709 --> 22:22.375
- I'M THE AVON LADY.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.208
- WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.083
- YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE SAME REASON I AM.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.667
- WHICH IS?
- TO KILL SIRKO.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.875
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO SENT YOU HERE,

22:30.875 --> 22:32.917
BUT I'M NOT GOING HALVSIES
WITH ANYONE.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.125
THIS IS MY JOB.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.834
[gunshot]
[struggling]

22:35.834 --> 22:38.625
[grunting]

22:38.625 --> 22:41.542
[gasps, sputters]

22:43.834 --> 22:46.291
- [panting]

22:46.291 --> 22:50.458
WE COULD HAVE
JUST GONE HALVSIES.

22:53.709 --> 22:54.750
WITH ALL
THE PEOPLE WHO WANT

22:54.750 --> 22:56.542
TO KILL ISAAK,
WHY IS IT SO HARD

22:56.542 --> 23:00.709
TO GET HIM DEAD?
[dog barking]

23:07.417 --> 23:10.375
[keyboard clicking]
[beep]

23:10.375 --> 23:12.250
- NOT THIS GUY.

23:12.250 --> 23:15.333
[keyboard clicking]
[beep]

23:15.333 --> 23:18.417
THIS ONE EITHER.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.917
[computer chirps]
DEXTER MORGAN.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.875
THIS GUY HAD A SLIP.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.208
- HAD?

23:25.208 --> 23:26.709
MEANING HE DOESN'T
HAVE ONE ANYMORE?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.917
- NO. HE MOVED
A FEW YEARS BACK.

23:28.917 --> 23:30.208
I REMEMBER IT
BECAUSE IT WAS ODD.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.041
HE HAD, UH, EIGHT MONTHS
TO GO ON HIS LEASE.

23:33.041 --> 23:35.750
- WHEN EXACTLY DID HE MOVE?

23:35.750 --> 23:38.834
- MAY, 2007.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.750
- ARE YOU SURE?

23:42.750 --> 23:46.625
- [chuckles] YEAH.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.917
- YOU'RE GETTING HEAVIER.
WHAT DID THEY FEED YOU UP THERE?

23:54.917 --> 23:56.083
- MAC AND CHEESE.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.333
AND MORE MAC AND CHEESE.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.959
- YOU WANT TO GO PLAY
ON THE BEACH AFTER WE EAT?

23:59.959 --> 24:02.333
- OH, I CAN TAKE HIM NOW.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.834
ASTOR AND CODY WERE FIGHTING
THE ENTIRE DRIVE DOWN.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.083
I NEED A BREAK.

24:07.083 --> 24:10.959
- MOJITOS ON THE HOUSE.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:10.959 --> 24:13.083
- FOR THE GROWN-UPS.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.458
SODAS FOR THE KIDS.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.959
SORRY, I GOTTA KEEP
MY LIQUOR LICENSE.

24:16.959 --> 24:18.583
EVERYTHING GOOD HERE?

24:18.583 --> 24:20.834
- IT'S PERFECT.
THANKS, ANGEL.

24:20.834 --> 24:25.667
PERFECT BECAUSE IT HAS
A BUILT-IN SECURITY SYSTEM.

24:25.667 --> 24:28.875
- DEXTER, CHECK OUT
MY ANGRY BIRDS  SCORE.

24:28.875 --> 24:30.125
- DEXTER DOESN'T WANT TO SEE
YOUR ANGRY BIRDS  SCORE, CODY.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.792
PUT IT AWAY.

24:32.792 --> 24:34.083
- I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.792
- WE MISSED YOU TOO.

24:35.792 --> 24:36.917
- SO HOW'S SCHOOL?

24:36.917 --> 24:38.959
IS MATH
STILL KICKING YOUR ASS?

24:38.959 --> 24:40.458
- BUTT.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.667
KICKING YOUR BUTT.

24:41.667 --> 24:42.792
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.792
IS MATH STILL KICKING YOUR BUTT?
[chuckling]

24:44.792 --> 24:48.125
- I'M A YEAR AHEAD IN MATH NOW,
AND I'M TAKING A.P. BIO.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.125
- IMPRESSIVE.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.625
- SHE PASSED OUT WHEN
THEY DISSECTED THE FETAL PIG.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.959
- CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT
FETAL PIGS AT DINNER?

24:55.959 --> 24:57.625
- [burps]

24:57.625 --> 24:59.083
- GOD, CODY, CAN WE NOT
GET THROUGH ONE DINNER

24:59.083 --> 25:01.458
WITHOUT YOU DOING SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DISGUSTING?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.959
- CAN YOU STOP ACTING
LIKE MISS PERFECT?

25:03.959 --> 25:05.500
YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT
THROUGH A WEEKEND

25:05.500 --> 25:07.792
WITHOUT SMOKING POT.

25:07.792 --> 25:09.917
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY COPS ARE HERE?

25:09.917 --> 25:11.208
YOU WANT TO GET ARRESTED?

25:11.208 --> 25:14.125
- GOD, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

25:15.917 --> 25:19.000
- [sighs]
GUESS I SHOULD GO TALK TO HER.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.041
- I'LL BE YOUR BACKUP.

25:23.041 --> 25:26.959
[children playing,
water lapping]

25:29.000 --> 25:30.834
- [sighs] I DON'T DO IT
A LOT, I SWEAR.

25:30.834 --> 25:34.125
JUST WHEN I GET
REALLY STRESSED OUT.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.125
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:36.125 --> 25:37.583
- IT'S JUST POT.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.667
IN SOME STATES,
IT'S NOT EVEN AGAINST THE LAW.

25:40.667 --> 25:43.709
- IT'S ALWAYS AGAINST THE LAW
FOR SOMEONE YOUR AGE,

25:43.709 --> 25:46.375
WHICH IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
BY THE WAY.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.000
- THANKS FOR THE PUBLIC
SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.083
- DEXTER'S RIGHT.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.375
SOMETIMES THE THINGS
THAT SEEM

25:50.375 --> 25:51.583
LIKE A GOOD IDEA
IN THE MOMENT

25:51.583 --> 25:55.583
ARE THE THINGS YOU'LL
END UP REGRETTING LATER.

25:56.875 --> 25:59.959
- ASTOR...

25:59.959 --> 26:03.208
I KNOW HOW...

26:03.208 --> 26:07.041
CERTAIN VICES CAN BE USED
TO RELIEVE STRESS.

26:10.166 --> 26:13.792
BUT SOMETIMES THOSE VICES
CAN CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS

26:13.792 --> 26:15.709
THAN THE ORIGINAL STRESS.

26:15.709 --> 26:20.250
- OKAY, I GET IT, POT IS EVIL.
ARE WE DONE?

26:20.250 --> 26:23.375
- WE--SURE, WE'RE DONE.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.208
KIDS ARE ALL ASLEEP
IN YOUR ROOM.

26:40.208 --> 26:42.583
I PUT HARRISON ON YOUR BED.
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

26:42.583 --> 26:45.250
- YEAH, SURE.
- [sighs]

26:45.250 --> 26:47.625
- HE DOESN'T WET THE BED,
DOES HE?

26:47.625 --> 26:48.792
- NOT ALWAYS.

26:48.792 --> 26:51.083
- YOU OWE ME.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.500
- JAMIE WILL BE HERE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.083
- HEY, DEX.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.583
UM...

26:58.583 --> 27:01.917
MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT...

27:01.917 --> 27:04.750
ABOUT HANNAH.

27:04.750 --> 27:05.959
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

27:05.959 --> 27:11.208
IF ANYONE DESERVES
WHAT YOU DO, SHE DOES, BUT...

27:11.208 --> 27:12.542
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
TO RESIST,

27:12.542 --> 27:14.250
AND I KNOW
YOU DID IT FOR ME.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.917
SO...
THANKS FOR CARING.

27:20.125 --> 27:24.000
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK ME.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.792
THANKS FOR TAKING
EVERYONE IN.

27:29.792 --> 27:34.000
- MY HOME IS THEIR HOME.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.208
- MY FAMILY.

27:35.208 --> 27:37.667
ALL THAT'S LEFT OF IT IS HERE,
UNDER ONE ROOF.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.000
IT SHOULD FEEL LIKE HOME.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.417
SO WHY DO I WANT SO BADLY
TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE?

27:46.166 --> 27:47.792
[knock at door]

27:47.792 --> 27:49.875
- [clears throat]

27:49.875 --> 27:53.166
[footsteps]

27:53.166 --> 27:54.500
LOOK WHO'S NOT HERE AGAIN.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.166
- [sighs]
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

27:57.166 --> 27:59.041
- FORTUNATELY,
YOU'VE MANAGED TO CATCH ME

27:59.041 --> 28:02.625
IN BETWEEN GENTLEMAN CALLERS.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.583
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S MY LUCKY NIGHT.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.500
- WHAT BRINGS YOU BY?

28:06.500 --> 28:09.291
OR IS THIS YOUR VERSION
OF A BOOTY CALL?

28:09.291 --> 28:11.333
- WHAT'S A BOOTY CALL?

28:11.333 --> 28:13.166
- SERIOUSLY?

28:13.166 --> 28:15.542
- ACTUALLY, I JUST STOPPED BY
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE BUSY

28:15.542 --> 28:16.792
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

28:16.792 --> 28:18.291
- SO YOU CAME BY TO SEE ME

28:18.291 --> 28:20.667
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE ME?

28:20.667 --> 28:23.458
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

28:23.458 --> 28:26.208
- SO WHAT'S GOT YOU SO BUSY?

28:26.208 --> 28:31.834
- NOTHING, I JUST--UH...

28:31.834 --> 28:34.709
THE HEAD OF THE KOSHKA
BROTHERHOOD WANTS TO KILL ME.

28:34.709 --> 28:38.208
- [laughs]

28:38.208 --> 28:41.834
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

28:41.834 --> 28:44.208
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT
A KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD IS,

28:44.208 --> 28:45.417
BUT IT SOUNDS BAD.

28:45.417 --> 28:48.333
- IT'S KIND OF A...

28:48.333 --> 28:51.542
UKRAINIAN MAFIA.
- WOW.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.834
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO PISS THEM OFF?

28:53.834 --> 28:56.875
- NOT THEM.
JUST ISAAK SIRKO.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.583
HE HAS THIS PERSONAL VENDETTA
AGAINST ME.

28:59.583 --> 29:02.750
- WHY?

29:02.750 --> 29:05.500
- I KILLED
ONE OF HIS KEY GUYS.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.375
- OH.
WELL, IT HAPPENS.

29:07.375 --> 29:08.709
- [chuckles]

29:08.709 --> 29:13.166
- SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS ISAAK SIRKO?

29:13.166 --> 29:14.709
- I KNOW THAT HE WANTS
TO KILL ME,

29:14.709 --> 29:17.000
AND THAT I NEED
TO KILL HIM FIRST,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.417
AND THAT IT'S HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

29:20.417 --> 29:24.166
- WELL, YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

29:24.166 --> 29:26.417
- UH, SURE.

29:26.417 --> 29:27.667
- YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME

29:27.667 --> 29:31.375
FINDING OUT ALL ABOUT ME
BEFORE YOU--

29:31.375 --> 29:33.500
- BEFORE I TRIED TO KILL YOU.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.875
- RIGHT.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.917
- THIS IS DIFFERENT.

29:36.917 --> 29:39.542
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU FIT MY CODE.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.834
I ALREADY KNOW ISAAK'S A KILLER.

29:41.834 --> 29:43.166
- WELL, STILL, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU HAVE A SYSTEM,

29:43.166 --> 29:45.375
AND IT'S WORKING FOR YOU,
RIGHT?

29:45.375 --> 29:46.792
- MOST OF THE TIME.

29:46.792 --> 29:49.875
- WELL, SO WHY DON'T YOU TRY
THE SAME THING ON THIS GUY?

29:49.875 --> 29:55.041
FIGURE OUT WHO HE IS, AND WHY
HE REALLY WANTS TO KILL YOU.

29:55.041 --> 29:58.583
HERE.

29:58.583 --> 30:01.542
TAKE MY VAN.
HE MIGHT KNOW YOUR CAR.

30:01.542 --> 30:04.333
BESIDES, IT'LL GIVE YOU
A DECENT EXCUSE TO COME BY

30:04.333 --> 30:08.458
AND NOT SEE ME AGAIN.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.834
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO TALK TO ANYONE

30:22.834 --> 30:27.125
ABOUT MY KILLS BEFORE.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.625
NOT LIKE THIS.

30:29.625 --> 30:34.583
NO JUDGMENT,
NO FEAR, NO PANIC.

30:34.583 --> 30:38.458
- THAT'S NICE.
- YEAH.

30:38.458 --> 30:42.000
- BUT I'M KIND OF TIRED
OF TALKING.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.291
MAYBE I CAN SHOW YOU
WHAT A BOOTY CALL IS.

30:44.291 --> 30:47.834
- [chuckles]
- MM.

30:54.667 --> 30:57.500
- COME ON, JOEY.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.667
I ONLY HAVE TO WORK FOR GEORGE
FOR TWO MORE YEARS,

30:59.667 --> 31:01.291
AND THEN I'LL HAVE MY FREEDOM.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.542
- YOU BELIEVE THAT?

31:03.542 --> 31:05.959
- HE LIKES HIS DANCERS YOUNG.

31:05.959 --> 31:09.959
THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE GIRLS
WHO WANT TO COME HERE.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.834
- I'M SORRY I LET YOU DOWN.

31:13.834 --> 31:18.500
- JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
DO ANYTHING FOR THEM AGAIN.

31:18.500 --> 31:22.291
NOT EVEN FOR ME.

31:22.291 --> 31:25.125
- I PROMISE.

31:25.125 --> 31:28.166
- OKAY.
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.

31:28.166 --> 31:31.000
- OKAY.

31:32.709 --> 31:35.000
[door closes,
water running]

31:35.000 --> 31:38.083
[knock at door]

31:51.792 --> 31:55.750
- HOW'D I KNOW I'D FIND
YOUR HORNY ASS HERE?

31:56.625 --> 32:00.458
I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.417
- I'M NOT INTERESTED.

32:02.417 --> 32:05.583
- OH, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE.

32:05.583 --> 32:06.917
BUT ISAAK SIRKO,

32:06.917 --> 32:08.834
HE WANTS YOU TO LOSE
THE BLOOD EVIDENCE

32:08.834 --> 32:11.208
LINKING HIM
TO THE COLOMBIAN MURDERS.

32:11.208 --> 32:12.917
[beep]

32:12.917 --> 32:15.583
LET ME SKIP TO THE GOOD PART.
[beeps]

32:15.583 --> 32:19.959
- IF I DO THIS,
NADIA'S A FREE WOMAN.

32:19.959 --> 32:23.792
YOU GIVE ME HER FUCKING
PASSPORT, UNDERSTAND?

32:23.792 --> 32:26.583
- DEAL.
AND I'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER.

32:26.583 --> 32:28.417
YOU CAN EVEN KEEP THE CASH.

32:28.417 --> 32:31.792
[beep] NOW DO WE
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?

32:31.792 --> 32:35.417
- IF I GO DOWN,
YOU'RE GOING DOWN WITH ME.

32:35.417 --> 32:36.750
- [chuckles]

32:36.750 --> 32:40.041
IT WON'T EXACTLY RUIN
MY REPUTATION.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.959
I GOT THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD
BEHIND ME.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.542
YOU SAW HOW LONG
SIRKO STAYED BEHIND BARS.

32:44.542 --> 32:46.375
WHO'S GONNA SAVE YOUR ASS?

32:46.375 --> 32:48.792
MIAMI METRO?

32:48.792 --> 32:49.917
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:49.917 --> 32:53.166
- SAME KIND OF SHIT
YOU USED TO DO FOR US.

32:53.166 --> 32:54.542
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SOME PRODUCT
THAT NEEDS TO MOVE.

32:54.542 --> 32:57.750
I NEED A COP AROUND
TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES WRONG.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.291
IF YOU HELP US,
YOU MAKE SOME MONEY.

32:59.291 --> 33:03.000
AND IF YOU DON'T, THAT RECORDING
GOES ON THE FUCKING CLOUD.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.500
I'M SORRY TO TWIST
YOUR ARM, BUDDY,

33:05.500 --> 33:08.667
BUT YOU REALLY LEFT ME
NO CHOICE.

33:08.667 --> 33:09.792
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

33:09.792 --> 33:15.500
[door opens, closes]

33:15.500 --> 33:17.583
- [sighs]

33:20.458 --> 33:22.667
- NO ONE ELSE HERE.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.834
- NOT ANYMORE, ANYWAY.

33:25.834 --> 33:27.250
DO YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

33:27.250 --> 33:29.000
- HE'S ONE OF GEORGE'S MEN.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.250
- SENT HERE TO KILL ME.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.625
GEORGE WOULDN'T MAKE A MOVE
WITHOUT GETTING APPROVAL

33:33.625 --> 33:36.583
FROM THE BOYS IN KIEV.

33:36.583 --> 33:37.625
SO MUCH FOR BROTHERHOOD.

33:37.625 --> 33:38.917
- THIS CAN BE FIXED.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.834
WE CAN GO HOME, WE CAN CALL--
- NO.

33:40.834 --> 33:44.166
I'M A DEAD MAN THERE.

33:44.166 --> 33:47.333
YOU'VE ALREADY GONE
ABOVE AND BEYOND

33:47.333 --> 33:49.000
THE CALL OF DUTY, JURG.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.709
YOUR LOYALTY
COULD GET YOU KILLED.

33:51.709 --> 33:57.208
- WHERE YOU GO, I GO.

33:57.208 --> 33:59.583
- MY OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS
SHOULD LAST SOME TIME.

33:59.583 --> 34:03.417
BUT I WON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO THE CORPORATE ACCOUNTS.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.709
BLOODY HELL!

34:05.709 --> 34:07.792
THEN THERE'S THIS.

34:07.792 --> 34:09.667
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.

34:09.667 --> 34:12.875
- WHO DO YOU THINK
KILLED HIM?

34:12.875 --> 34:16.542
- WELL THAT'S A JOB
FOR THE POLICE, ISN'T IT?

34:16.542 --> 34:19.417
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND GIVE
OUR FRIENDS DOWNSTAIRS A CALL.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.417
[camera shutter clicks]

34:21.417 --> 34:25.250
[indistinct radio chatter]

34:30.041 --> 34:34.166
- LOOKS LIKE
THE GANG'S ALL HERE.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.291
- SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA

34:38.291 --> 34:39.875
WHAT HE WAS DOING
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

34:39.875 --> 34:42.250
- NOT A CLUE.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.583
BUT I'M SURE YOUR TRUSTY
BLOOD SPATTER ANALYST

34:44.583 --> 34:45.917
COULD FIGURE IT OUT.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.417
- MR. SIRKO,
THE GUN THAT WE FOUND

34:48.417 --> 34:51.709
WOULD SUGGEST THAT HE CAME HERE
TO KILL SOMEONE.

34:51.709 --> 34:53.875
AND SINCE YOU LIVE HERE,

34:53.875 --> 34:56.750
THAT SOMEONE
MAY VERY WELL BE YOU.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.083
- WHAT A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT.

34:59.083 --> 35:01.542
then PERHAPS I NEED
SOME SORT OF POLICE ESCORT.

35:01.542 --> 35:04.417
OH, I ALREADY HAVE THAT.

35:04.417 --> 35:05.709
- WELL WE'LL HAVE TO CONFIRM
WITH THE M.E.,

35:05.709 --> 35:08.208
BUT JUDGING BY THE LIVIDITY
AND STATE OF RIGOR,

35:08.208 --> 35:10.041
I'D ESTIMATE
THE TIME OF DEATH

35:10.041 --> 35:12.208
AS SOMETIME
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

35:12.208 --> 35:16.583
- LET ME SEE NOW,
WHERE WAS I YESTERDAY AFTERNOON?

35:16.583 --> 35:19.709
PERHAPS THESE KIND OFFICERS
COULD REFRESH MY MEMORY.

35:19.709 --> 35:21.917
- UNIS TAILED HIM ALL DAY.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.208
HE WASN'T HERE.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.917
- SEEMS I HAVE AN ALIBI.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.125
I HOPE THEY'RE TRUSTWORTHY.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.875
- DEX, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

35:28.875 --> 35:31.333
- YES, PLEASE, DEX,
TELL US YOUR THEORY.

35:31.333 --> 35:34.083
I'M SO CURIOUS.
- [sighs]

35:34.083 --> 35:38.125
WELL, JUDGING BY THE PHOTO
FOUND IN THE VICTIM'S POCKET,

35:38.125 --> 35:40.667
HE WAY LYING IN WAIT
FOR MR. SIRKO.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.083
HERE YOU GO.

35:43.083 --> 35:45.875
THESE SCUFF MARKS INDICATE
A STRUGGLE.

35:45.875 --> 35:49.125
THEY FELL TO THE FLOOR.

35:49.125 --> 35:52.542
AND THE KILLER CUT
HIS CAROTID ARTERY

35:52.542 --> 35:57.291
WITH ONE SWIPE
OF A VERY SHARP KNIFE.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.417
- MY, MY.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.959
YOU COULDN'T HAVE DESCRIBED
THAT BETTER

35:59.959 --> 36:03.500
IF YOU'D BEEN THERE YOURSELF.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.875
- THANKS.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.542
- HEY, VINCE, I HAVE PLANS
WITH THE KIDS TODAY.

36:07.542 --> 36:09.500
YOU THINK YOU CAN
FINISH THIS UP?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.333
- FINE. BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN

36:11.333 --> 36:13.500
SOME OF MY KIDS SO THAT
I CAN SKIP OUT ON WORK.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.083
- THANKS.

36:16.083 --> 36:17.875
VINCE IS GONNA TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.250
KEEP HIM OCCUPIED
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.000
KILL YA LATER, ISAAK.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.333
- YEAH!

36:23.333 --> 36:25.709
OH, THAT'S GONNA BE
REALLY GOOD.

36:25.709 --> 36:28.458
SEE, GET IT ALL UP IN THERE.
[children playing]

36:28.458 --> 36:30.208
YEAH!

36:30.208 --> 36:32.917
THAT'S A STRONG CASTLE,
MISTER.

36:32.917 --> 36:36.917
YOU'RE DOING SO GOOD.

36:36.917 --> 36:38.333
[laughs]
- WANT THAT?

36:38.333 --> 36:41.166
- HE DID IT ALL HIMSELF.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.709
- THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME.
- YUMMY.

36:44.709 --> 36:45.875
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK YOU NEED

36:45.875 --> 36:49.166
A LITTLE BIT MORE SUNSCREEN,
HARRISON.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.667
- HEY, BUDDY, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS PLACE NEEDS?

36:51.667 --> 36:53.000
A MOAT!

36:53.000 --> 36:57.166
KEEP THE BAD GUYS OUT.
[exerting]

37:00.917 --> 37:04.041
- OH.

37:04.041 --> 37:08.000
- I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.917
- CAN I HAVE SOME
OF THAT LEG?

37:12.709 --> 37:16.667
[crowd chattering,
surf lapping]

37:19.834 --> 37:22.125
- I MISS THE BEACH.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.500
IT REMINDS ME OF MOM.

37:24.500 --> 37:28.166
- YEAH, SHE USED TO TAKE
YOU GUYS HERE ALL THE TIME.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.959
- ATLANTA DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE HOME,

37:29.959 --> 37:31.333
BUT HERE DOESN'T EITHER.

37:31.333 --> 37:35.417
IT'S LIKE THERE'S NO PLACE
I ACTUALLY BELONG.

37:35.417 --> 37:38.750
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37:38.750 --> 37:41.709
- ACTUALLY, YEAH, I DO.

37:41.709 --> 37:45.542
- IF MY GRANDPARENTS
FIND OUT ABOUT THE POT,

37:45.542 --> 37:47.583
THEY'LL THINK I'M JUST TURNING
INTO MY DAD OR SOMETHING.

37:47.583 --> 37:49.333
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
JUST WAITING FOR THAT

37:49.333 --> 37:51.583
TO HAPPEN ANYWAYS.

37:54.959 --> 37:58.750
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
SOMEONE TOLD ME WHO I WAS,

37:58.750 --> 38:04.458
AND I PRETTY MUCH TOOK
HIS WORD FOR IT.

38:04.458 --> 38:09.917
IF I'D TAKEN THE TIME
TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF,

38:09.917 --> 38:12.291
I WOULD HAVE
TURNED OUT DIFFERENT.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.500
- DIFFERENT HOW?

38:14.500 --> 38:18.500
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
BUT I KIND OF WISH I DID.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.959
- FOR THE RECORD,
YOU DIDN'T TURN OUT SO BAD.

38:29.792 --> 38:34.667
- FOR THE RECORD, THE POT
WILL STAY OFF THE RECORD.

38:40.125 --> 38:45.125
[phone ringing]

38:45.125 --> 38:48.000
[beep]
JUST GIVE ME A SEC.

38:49.834 --> 38:50.917
HEY, HANNAH.

38:50.917 --> 38:53.542
- HEY. I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

38:53.542 --> 38:56.000
BUT I ACCIDENTALLY LEFT
MY GREENHOUSE KEYS IN THE VAN.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.208
- I'M KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

38:58.208 --> 39:00.750
I COULD BRING THEM BY
IN A FEW HOURS.

39:00.750 --> 39:05.417
- JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE
AND I'LL SWING BY.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.417
- HOBIE BEACH.
TOWER ONE.

39:07.417 --> 39:11.250
- OKAY, GREAT.
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE.

39:11.250 --> 39:15.709
[gulls squawking,
children playing]

39:23.333 --> 39:28.208
- IS THIS THE ONE?
- YEAH, THANKS.

39:28.208 --> 39:31.208
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

39:31.208 --> 39:33.542
- HEY, DEXTER!

39:33.542 --> 39:36.875
LOOK!
[laughter]

39:36.875 --> 39:39.208
- OH, RIGHT.

39:39.208 --> 39:40.208
OF COURSE.

39:40.208 --> 39:41.959
I SHOULD'VE SEEN
THAT ONE COMING.

39:41.959 --> 39:45.667
- NO, SHE'S NOT, UM--

39:45.667 --> 39:47.500
[sighs]
SHE'S MY NANNY.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.709
- YOUR NANNY?

39:50.709 --> 39:54.709
- YEAH, THAT LITTLE GUY
IS MY SON.

39:54.709 --> 39:58.125
HARRISON.
HE'S THREE.

39:58.125 --> 39:59.917
[laughter]
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS MOTHER,

39:59.917 --> 40:02.041
HOW SHE PASSED AWAY.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.542
THE OTHER TWO
ARE ASTOR AND CODY.

40:04.542 --> 40:05.917
THEY'RE MY STEPKIDS.

40:05.917 --> 40:09.166
THEY LIVE IN ORLANDO
WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS.

40:09.166 --> 40:12.375
HARRISON LIVES WITH ME...

40:12.375 --> 40:16.166
MOST OF THE TIME.

40:16.166 --> 40:17.208
[sighs]

40:17.208 --> 40:21.000
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.959
- YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME,
OR YOU WERE AFRAID IT WOULD

40:22.959 --> 40:26.125
PUSH ME AWAY?

40:26.125 --> 40:29.959
- MAYBE A LITTLE OF BOTH.

40:29.959 --> 40:33.917
- WELL I'D LOVE
TO MEET THEM SOMETIME.

40:35.125 --> 40:37.375
YOU'RE LUCKY, DEXTER.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.917
- LUCKY?

40:38.917 --> 40:40.583
- NO MATTER WHERE I GO,

40:40.583 --> 40:44.709
I'M HANNAH MCKAY,
THE SPREE KILLER'S GIRLFRIEND.

40:44.709 --> 40:47.000
NOBODY HAS A CLUE
WHO YOU ARE.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.542
YOU GET TO HAVE THIS
NORMAL LIFE, WITH KIDS AND...

40:55.208 --> 40:58.375
- IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT?

40:58.375 --> 41:00.583
- IT WAS, ONCE UPON A TIME.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.375
WAYNE AND I TALKED ABOUT
HAVING TEN OF THEM.

41:03.375 --> 41:06.792
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT A TRAIN
WRECK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN?

41:06.792 --> 41:08.667
THEN WHEN I
GOT MARRIED TO JAKE,

41:08.667 --> 41:10.583
I THOUGHT, "THIS IS HOW IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE," YOU KNOW?

41:10.583 --> 41:14.583
BUT WHEN THAT WHOLE THING
WENT TO SHIT,

41:14.583 --> 41:19.458
I JUST FIGURED IT WASN'T REALLY
IN THE CARDS FOR ME.

41:19.458 --> 41:21.959
- THAT'S WHAT
I USED TO THINK TOO.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.500
- DEX! GET OVER HERE!

41:24.500 --> 41:27.125
[laughter]
- WELL, I WON'T INTRUDE.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.542
ENJOY YOUR TIME WITH THEM.

41:29.542 --> 41:31.291
- OKAY.

41:39.250 --> 41:43.375
[knock at door]

41:47.000 --> 41:49.500
[lock clicks]

41:49.500 --> 41:50.625
- HEY.

41:50.625 --> 41:53.083
EVERYONE ASLEEP?

41:53.083 --> 41:55.875
- YEAH, FINALLY.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.792
DEXTER, YOU DID NOT
TELL ME THAT BEDTIME

41:57.792 --> 42:00.333
IS, LIKE,
THIS TWO HOUR PROCESS.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.625
AND THAT READING
THOSE DR. SEUSS BOOKS

42:01.625 --> 42:03.417
OUT LOUD
IS REALLY FUCKING HARD.

42:03.417 --> 42:06.834
- [chuckles]
SORRY I MISSED THAT.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.667
- TEENAGERS ARE GREAT, THOUGH.
YOU JUST TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.

42:08.667 --> 42:11.166
I MEAN, MY HOUSE
HAS NEVER LOOKED SO CLEAN.

42:11.166 --> 42:14.041
I LOVE FAMILIES.

42:14.041 --> 42:15.417
[refrigerator opens]

42:15.417 --> 42:18.417
- DOES HANNAH FIT INTO
MY FAMILY SOMEWHERE?

42:18.417 --> 42:21.083
[refrigerator closes]

42:21.083 --> 42:23.625
- [clears throat]

42:27.709 --> 42:30.542
WHAT'S THAT DOING HERE?

42:32.750 --> 42:34.333
- OH, I BORROWED
A CAR FROM A FRIEND

42:34.333 --> 42:37.709
SO ISAAK
WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

42:37.709 --> 42:41.667
- DOES THAT FRIEND
HAPPEN TO BE HANNAH MCKAY?

42:45.291 --> 42:47.125
- [laughs]
I WAS GOING TO--

42:47.125 --> 42:50.041
- OH, MY GOD.

42:50.041 --> 42:53.166
- [sighs]

42:54.750 --> 42:59.041
- ARE YOU FUCKING HER?

42:59.041 --> 43:00.333
- DEB, I CAN EXPLAIN.

43:00.333 --> 43:05.125
- I KNOW WHAT FUCKING IS.
NO EXPLANATION NECESSARY.

43:05.125 --> 43:08.458
IS THAT WHY
YOU WOULDN'T KILL HER?

43:08.458 --> 43:11.083
- PARTIALLY.

43:11.083 --> 43:15.500
- [laughs]

43:15.500 --> 43:19.959
I AM THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE
ON THE PLANET.

43:19.959 --> 43:22.250
ALL THAT BULLSHIT ABOUT
YOU CARING ABOUT ME TOO MUCH

43:22.250 --> 43:23.750
TO LET ME DO SOMETHING
I WOULD REGRET?

43:23.750 --> 43:25.750
I FUCKING BOUGHT IT.

43:25.750 --> 43:29.083
- DEB, EVERYTHING
I SAID WAS TRUE.

43:29.083 --> 43:31.875
- [sighs]

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
- OKAY, YES,
I DIDN'T KILL HANNAH

43:36.500 --> 43:37.959
BECAUSE I HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HER,

43:37.959 --> 43:39.417
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE
WHAT I SAID TO YOU

43:39.417 --> 43:42.417
ANY LESS TRUE.
- FEELINGS?

43:42.417 --> 43:45.542
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER?

43:45.542 --> 43:47.917
- I DON'T KNOW.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.542
- IS IT BECAUSE
SHE'S A SERIAL KILLER?

43:51.542 --> 43:54.500
DOES THAT TURN YOU ON
OR SOMETHING?

43:54.500 --> 43:56.458
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU ALL DO?

43:56.458 --> 43:57.458
DO YOU SIT AROUND
AND TALK ABOUT

43:57.458 --> 44:02.000
WHO YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE OUT NEXT?

44:02.000 --> 44:06.041
- [sighs]
- OH, MY GOD.

44:06.041 --> 44:08.750
PRICE?

44:08.750 --> 44:11.083
DID YOU FUCKING
HELP HER WITH PRICE?

44:11.083 --> 44:12.834
- NO!

44:12.834 --> 44:14.834
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I FUCKING ASK YOU, DEXTER.

44:14.834 --> 44:17.041
EVERY TIME I THINK
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE,

44:17.041 --> 44:19.208
YOU TELL ME SOMETHING WORSE.

44:19.208 --> 44:20.834
- BEING WITH HANNAH
IS WORSE THAN BEING A KILLER?

44:20.834 --> 44:23.041
- YES!

44:23.041 --> 44:27.125
NO. I DON'T--

44:30.792 --> 44:32.500
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GONNA STOP KILLING.

44:32.500 --> 44:37.166
I MEAN, YOU'VE MADE THAT
VERY CLEAR.

44:37.166 --> 44:40.125
BUT YOU CAN STOP SEEING HER.

44:40.125 --> 44:42.959
- I DON'T WANT
TO STOP SEEING HER.

44:42.959 --> 44:45.834
- LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER HUSBAND, DEXTER.

44:45.834 --> 44:48.583
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD WITH MEN.

44:48.583 --> 44:51.375
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE FUCKING BODY TRAIL

44:51.375 --> 44:53.417
THAT YOU'VE LEFT
IN YOUR LOVE LIFE.

44:53.417 --> 44:56.458
- I'M NOT ASKING
YOUR PERMISSION, DEB.

44:56.458 --> 44:59.417
- SO YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT IT DOES TO ME?

44:59.417 --> 45:01.583
- I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

45:01.583 --> 45:04.417
- WELL, GUESS WHAT?
YOU DID.

45:04.417 --> 45:07.000
YOU PICKED THE ONE WAY
THAT YOU COULD HURT ME

45:07.000 --> 45:09.959
WORSE THAN YOU COULD EVER
FUCKING UNDERSTAND.

45:09.959 --> 45:13.041
- WHA--

45:13.041 --> 45:14.917
YOU TOLD ME YOU ACCEPTED
ME BEING A KILLER.

45:14.917 --> 45:16.542
I FEEL LIKE IF YOU LOVE ME,
YOU'LL ACCEPT THIS.

45:16.542 --> 45:17.875
- [sputters]
IF I LOVE YOU?

45:17.875 --> 45:19.291
IF  I LOVE YOU!

45:19.291 --> 45:20.542
I WENT TO THE CHURCH
THAT NIGHT

45:20.542 --> 45:21.792
THAT YOU KILLED
TRAVIS MARSHALL

45:21.792 --> 45:25.750
TO TELL YOU THAT
I'M IN  LOVE WITH YOU!

45:30.166 --> 45:33.875
[cries]

45:33.875 --> 45:35.667
- YOU'RE...

45:35.667 --> 45:37.125
IN LOVE WITH ME?

45:37.125 --> 45:41.166
- FUCK!
OH, MY GOD.

45:41.166 --> 45:42.834
[cries]

45:42.834 --> 45:46.709
WAS.

45:46.709 --> 45:48.625
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I FUCKING LIKE  YOU.

45:48.625 --> 45:51.709
[laughs nervously]
THIS IS--

45:51.709 --> 45:54.750
OH, FORGET IT.

45:59.500 --> 46:02.917
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME?

46:02.917 --> 46:05.792
- [cries]

46:08.083 --> 46:10.250
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT.

46:10.250 --> 46:14.917
I DON'T--

46:14.917 --> 46:16.583
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD,
AND IT'S GROSS,

46:16.583 --> 46:21.208
AND IT'S FUCKED UP, BUT--
[cries]

46:21.208 --> 46:24.917
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
FEEL THE SAME.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.125
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF FEEL THE SAME.

46:28.125 --> 46:30.333
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING TO BE
IN LOVE WITH YOUR BROTHER,

46:30.333 --> 46:32.375
BUT IT IS
A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL

46:32.375 --> 46:33.583
TO BE IN LOVE
WITH YOUR BROTHER

46:33.583 --> 46:36.959
WHO'S A GODDAMN FUCKING
SERIAL KILLER.

46:36.959 --> 46:40.667
[cries]

46:40.667 --> 46:42.500
