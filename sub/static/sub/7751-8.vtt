WEBVTT

00:02.119 --> 00:03.359
Oh, he is.

00:03.494 --> 00:04.878
You must miss Rosie
something fierce, huh?

00:04.879 --> 00:06.262
As a matter of fact, I do.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.892
You and me...
We both got to tap that.

00:10.648 --> 00:13.013
- Did you get all that?
- Every frame.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.787
- I've never seen him like this.
- It's the beauty of pictures.

00:14.822 --> 00:17.112
They don't lie.

00:17.526 --> 00:19.623
- You have a date?
- He's making me dinner.

00:19.658 --> 00:21.108
I can take you
on a tour later,

00:21.109 --> 00:23.558
I've just had my bedroom redone
and I'm dying to show it off.

00:23.593 --> 00:24.648
Your bedroom?

00:24.978 --> 00:26.896
And It's nice to know
how do you feel about me.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.560
- He kissed you?
- No, I was really nice to him.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.427
And he misunderstood.

00:32.462 --> 00:34.473
- I already have a boyfriend.
- Who is It?

00:34.508 --> 00:36.412
- He's a celebrity.
- Oh.

00:36.886 --> 00:39.927
I just got off the phone with Rosie.
She's furious with me.

00:39.962 --> 00:41.345
Spence... Come here.

00:43.395 --> 00:46.072
I know Dahlia's
affair was with Opal.

00:46.073 --> 00:47.040
Who told you that?

00:47.074 --> 00:48.508
I can no longer live

00:48.542 --> 00:50.376
under the same roof
as that woman!

00:50.411 --> 00:52.045
- What's this?
- A severance check.

00:52.079 --> 00:54.347
Now, that is
more than generous.

00:54.381 --> 00:55.849
And Ethan's still in my will.

00:55.883 --> 00:58.518
He won't get that money
until you're dead.

01:19.139 --> 01:21.941
Hello.

01:21.976 --> 01:24.611
I'm his fiancee. Why?

01:24.645 --> 01:28.248
Oh, my God.

01:28.282 --> 01:30.083
Mom!

01:30.117 --> 01:32.285
Mom!
My car's gone.

01:32.319 --> 01:34.721
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Lower your voice.

01:34.755 --> 01:37.390
I parked it in the driveway
last night, but now it's gone.

01:37.424 --> 01:40.760
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

01:40.794 --> 01:42.829
The car wasn't stolen.

01:42.863 --> 01:45.465
I needed it for something.

01:45.499 --> 01:47.033
What?

01:47.067 --> 01:48.835
Opal!

01:50.304 --> 01:52.238
- What's wrong?
- The police called.

01:52.273 --> 01:54.140
Nicholas was hit by a car.

01:54.174 --> 01:55.141
Oh, my lord!

01:55.175 --> 01:56.676
He went for a run last night.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.678
He didn't have his I.D. on him.
That's why they didn't call sooner.

01:58.712 --> 02:00.280
Is Nick all right?

02:00.314 --> 02:01.781
They're not sure.

02:01.815 --> 02:02.815
I need to get to the hospital.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.083
Let me take you.

02:04.118 --> 02:05.818
- You shouldn't be driving right now.
- Thank you.

02:07.421 --> 02:08.821
Mom?

02:18.465 --> 02:21.434
<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -

02:31.442 --> 02:33.350
Why do you look so exhausted?

02:33.384 --> 02:36.386
Perhaps because I begin
so many of my days

02:36.421 --> 02:38.622
with conversations like this.

02:38.656 --> 02:40.157
No, seriously, I'm concerned.

02:40.191 --> 02:42.592
Is the mattress in your room
comfortable?

02:42.627 --> 02:45.562
It must be... I'm on it
eight hours a night.

02:45.596 --> 02:47.731
Yes, but are those hours
spent sleeping?

02:49.467 --> 02:52.903
Are you asking
if I have insomnia?

02:52.937 --> 02:55.005
Well, of course.
What else could I mean?

02:55.039 --> 02:57.074
Uh, Mrs. Powell.

02:57.108 --> 03:00.577
I've reset the code.
So, if there's nothing else...

03:00.611 --> 03:01.912
Oh, not at all.
Enjoy your day off.

03:01.946 --> 03:03.914
Oh, that's right. What exciting
things do you have planned?

03:03.948 --> 03:06.616
Uh, just going
to run some errands.

03:06.651 --> 03:08.518
Oh, you can't fool me...
A strapping man like you.

03:08.553 --> 03:12.356
I bet you're on your way
to some scandalous tryst.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.458
Uh, afraid not.

03:14.492 --> 03:16.593
Um, the truth is I'm not seeing
anybody right now.

03:16.627 --> 03:17.594
Well, why not?

03:17.628 --> 03:19.196
You could have any woman
you wanted.

03:19.230 --> 03:20.731
Don't you agree, Evelyn?
Hmm?

03:20.765 --> 03:22.332
Shouldn't Tony have someone
in his life...

03:22.367 --> 03:26.103
Someone vibrant
and... young?

03:30.174 --> 03:33.877
Would you ask Valentina to bring
me some more coffee, please?

03:33.911 --> 03:35.545
I'll do it for you, my darling.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.147
Oh.

03:43.821 --> 03:45.555
He knows.

03:45.590 --> 03:46.757
He suspects.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.358
But he's not sure.

03:48.393 --> 03:50.160
So he'll be watching us?

03:50.194 --> 03:53.096
Very closely.

03:53.164 --> 03:54.998
Well, how are we going to
make love?

03:55.033 --> 03:59.569
Quietly, I would imagine.

04:00.738 --> 04:01.905
Carmen.

04:01.939 --> 04:04.541
Are you gonna see Rosie
this week?

04:04.575 --> 04:05.942
Uh, probably. Why?

04:05.977 --> 04:09.646
She's not returning my calls,
so I wrote her a note.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.181
Do you think you could maybe
give it to her?

04:11.215 --> 04:13.483
Honestly, I'd rather not.

04:13.518 --> 04:15.385
I don't want to make things
awkward for you.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.055
I'm just a-a man in love.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.723
Don't worry about it.

04:19.757 --> 04:22.859
You've got some shaving cream
on your...

04:24.562 --> 04:26.063
Okay.

04:26.097 --> 04:28.198
Oh, hey, buddy.

04:28.232 --> 04:29.800
Excited for the weekend?

04:29.867 --> 04:31.101
Got any big plans?

04:31.135 --> 04:32.569
Nope.

04:32.603 --> 04:34.771
Really? You should be hanging
with your friends, having fun.

04:34.806 --> 04:38.175
If you want me out of here,
just say so.

04:38.209 --> 04:39.910
Why would I want you
out of here?

04:39.944 --> 04:40.977
I don't know.

04:41.012 --> 04:42.345
Maybe you want the house
all to yourself

04:42.380 --> 04:43.513
so you can bang some chick.

04:43.548 --> 04:46.616
Whoa, buddy.
Language.

04:46.651 --> 04:48.151
Do you deny it?

04:50.054 --> 04:51.755
I'm going through a divorce
right now.

04:51.789 --> 04:53.390
Ladies aren't really
on the agenda.

04:53.424 --> 04:56.393
Are you sure?
Not even one special lady?

04:56.427 --> 04:57.961
A sexy maid, perhaps?

04:57.995 --> 05:00.430
How do you know about that?

05:00.465 --> 05:03.100
Kind of pathetic,
don't you think...

05:03.134 --> 05:05.969
- Screwing the help?
- Hey, you're out of line.

05:06.003 --> 05:08.038
Just trying to talk man to man.

05:08.072 --> 05:10.474
You got a long way to go
before you're a man.

05:13.678 --> 05:15.779
Zoila!

05:17.615 --> 05:20.851
I'm back from Dr. Kimball.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.620
Zoila?

05:24.856 --> 05:26.123
Zoila!

05:29.560 --> 05:30.760
Thank God!

05:30.795 --> 05:33.130
I thought you were dead!

05:33.164 --> 05:34.231
Why?

05:34.265 --> 05:36.766
The look on your face,
it was so gruesome!

05:38.102 --> 05:39.803
I'm sorry.

05:39.837 --> 05:41.972
I was with Javier again
last night,

05:42.006 --> 05:43.740
and we...
Went pretty late.

05:43.774 --> 05:45.308
You had sex with him.

05:45.343 --> 05:46.676
Put that finger down.

05:46.711 --> 05:48.278
You did!
You little hussy!

05:48.312 --> 05:49.980
So, how was it?

05:50.014 --> 05:52.315
None of your business.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.784
Aw, come on.

05:54.852 --> 05:57.754
I ways tell you about
my sexual adventures.

05:57.788 --> 06:00.090
And I always ask you to stop.

06:01.626 --> 06:05.128
After all the years with Pablo,
it must've been so different.

06:05.163 --> 06:08.298
Honestly, I'd forgotten
sex could last longer

06:08.332 --> 06:10.800
than the commercial break
of a football game.

06:10.835 --> 06:13.103
Ah!
I'm so happy for you!

06:13.137 --> 06:15.505
The bad news is...

06:15.540 --> 06:17.374
I think I'm falling for him.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.643
Then I have to meet Javier.

06:19.677 --> 06:20.844
Why?

06:20.878 --> 06:22.646
So I can give my blessing.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.915
After all,
you're like a sister to me...

06:24.949 --> 06:26.883
A surly sister
who I pay to clean,

06:26.918 --> 06:28.285
but a sister nonetheless.

06:28.319 --> 06:31.288
I guess I could bring him over
for drinks tonight.

06:31.322 --> 06:34.124
Wonderful!

06:39.297 --> 06:41.131
Who I pay to clean...

06:41.165 --> 06:43.567
That was the important part
of that sentence.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.510
Miguel!

06:53.544 --> 06:55.812
You know you can't watch this!

06:55.880 --> 06:57.380
That's for grown-ups.

06:57.415 --> 06:58.682
Perdon.

06:58.716 --> 07:00.650
In English.

07:00.685 --> 07:02.185
I'm sorry.

07:02.220 --> 07:03.887
Now finish your homework, mijo.

07:03.921 --> 07:05.522
In English.

07:05.556 --> 07:08.925
Finish your homework,
my little monster. Aah!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.560
Didi! Didi!

07:13.164 --> 07:14.164
Didi!

07:14.198 --> 07:15.699
Where the hell are you?!

07:15.733 --> 07:17.567
She's not here.
What's wrong?

07:17.602 --> 07:19.102
I just came from the bank.

07:19.136 --> 07:21.438
I've been shut out
of daddy's accounts!

07:21.472 --> 07:22.872
Why?

07:22.907 --> 07:23.974
They said it's because

07:24.008 --> 07:25.942
I don't have his
power of attorney anymore.

07:25.977 --> 07:27.410
So why look
for Mrs. Didi?

07:27.445 --> 07:29.346
Well, she just has to be
behind this.

07:29.380 --> 07:32.215
Who else would go to all this
trouble to screw old Lucinda?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.717
Do you want me to talk to her?

07:33.751 --> 07:37.120
That's sweet of you to ask,
but no.

07:37.154 --> 07:41.458
This is between me
and that gold-digging whore!

07:46.797 --> 07:50.233
So, why on earth
are we having lunch?

07:50.268 --> 07:52.969
Uncle Ken has taken his power
of attorney away from Lucinda.

07:54.071 --> 07:56.273
Wish I could've been there
when she heard.

07:56.307 --> 07:57.440
Well, I wanted to warn you.

07:57.475 --> 07:58.775
She's gonna come at you
over this.

07:58.809 --> 08:01.144
Why?
I had nothing to do with it.

08:01.178 --> 08:03.480
Doesn't matter.
She's unstable.

08:03.514 --> 08:05.382
I don't envy you
having to live with her.

08:05.416 --> 08:07.584
I once I asked Kenny
to give her the boot,

08:07.618 --> 08:10.387
and he said, "I can't.
She's my daughter."

08:10.421 --> 08:12.455
Stupid DNA.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.591
One day she might go too far.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.592
Who knows?

08:15.626 --> 08:17.761
Uncle Ken
could change his mind.

08:17.795 --> 08:19.929
What do you mean by too far?

08:19.964 --> 08:21.464
I don't know exactly.

08:21.499 --> 08:23.533
But if you keep your ears open,

08:23.601 --> 08:25.935
an opportunity
might present itself.

08:25.970 --> 08:28.672
And you'd be willing
to help me with this?

08:28.706 --> 08:30.573
You know me, Didi.

08:30.608 --> 08:32.775
I'm all about helping.

08:39.417 --> 08:40.417
He's awake.

08:40.451 --> 08:42.085
Can I see him?

08:42.119 --> 08:44.087
For a few minutes.

08:44.121 --> 08:45.555
But just because he's conscious

08:45.589 --> 08:47.090
does not mean
he's out of danger.

08:47.124 --> 08:50.427
But he's gonna be all right
after the surgery?

08:50.461 --> 08:52.662
The accident
shattered several bones.

08:52.697 --> 08:55.398
One of the fragments
is very close to the aorta,

08:55.433 --> 08:57.434
so the surgery
will be difficult.

08:57.468 --> 08:59.869
Okay.

09:06.744 --> 09:08.445
Hey.

09:08.479 --> 09:12.148
How are you feeling?

09:12.183 --> 09:15.151
I'm okay... for now.

09:15.186 --> 09:18.054
The doctors say
this surgery is risky.

09:18.089 --> 09:20.156
There's a chance
I won't come out of it.

09:20.224 --> 09:21.691
We can't think like that.

09:21.726 --> 09:24.961
But just in case,
I need you to know

09:24.995 --> 09:27.697
I love you with all my heart.

09:27.732 --> 09:28.998
We have the rest of our lives

09:29.033 --> 09:30.500
to say how much
we love each other.

09:30.534 --> 09:31.701
But if something goes wrong,

09:31.736 --> 09:33.169
I don't want to have
any regrets.

09:33.204 --> 09:37.474
So... before I go
into surgery tomorrow,

09:37.508 --> 09:39.476
I need you to do something.

09:39.510 --> 09:41.311
Anything you want.

09:41.345 --> 09:43.646
Marry me.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.329
Marisol!
We got your message.

09:52.363 --> 09:54.064
How's Nick?

09:54.098 --> 09:55.465
Ohh, not good.

09:55.499 --> 09:57.867
He has to have surgery
tomorrow.

09:57.902 --> 09:59.202
Is he going to be okay?

09:59.236 --> 10:01.037
There's a chance he could die.

10:01.072 --> 10:04.641
And he asked me to marry him.

10:04.675 --> 10:07.077
Obviously.
You're engaged.

10:07.111 --> 10:09.813
No, he wants to get married
before the surgery.

10:09.847 --> 10:11.147
Tomorrow?

10:11.182 --> 10:13.350
What did you say?

10:13.384 --> 10:15.719
What do you think I said?

10:15.753 --> 10:18.154
He's lying there
with a bruised face

10:18.189 --> 10:22.225
and tubes sticking out
of his arms.

10:22.259 --> 10:25.261
I give up.
What did you say?

10:25.296 --> 10:27.197
I said yes.

10:27.231 --> 10:28.999
Oh...
Marisol.

10:30.267 --> 10:32.068
Can I be honest?

10:32.103 --> 10:33.370
I know.

10:33.404 --> 10:35.605
It's stupid to marry a man
I have so many doubts about.

10:35.639 --> 10:37.574
He's lied to me, kept secrets.

10:37.608 --> 10:39.209
And he might have
killed Dahlia.

10:39.243 --> 10:40.744
You don't know that.

10:40.778 --> 10:44.214
I'm sure Nick isn't as evil
as she thinks he is.

10:44.248 --> 10:46.816
Fine. That could be a toast
at the reception.

10:46.851 --> 10:48.184
Guys, please.

10:48.219 --> 10:51.588
Why can't you just go to Nick
and say, "Nick, I'm not ready"?

10:51.622 --> 10:53.390
Because I could be wrong.

10:53.424 --> 10:55.558
He's a good man.

10:55.593 --> 10:58.461
And there could be a simple
explanation for all of this.

10:58.496 --> 11:01.698
And if I desert him now
in his hour of need,

11:01.732 --> 11:05.168
I-I could lose him,
and God help me, I love him.

11:07.638 --> 11:09.406
So, what can we do?

11:11.042 --> 11:14.177
Help me get ready
for the wedding.

11:14.211 --> 11:15.478
Okay.

11:15.513 --> 11:17.347
Well, you'll need something
old, something new,

11:17.381 --> 11:20.116
uh, something borrowed,
something blue.

11:20.151 --> 11:23.053
And if did kill his wife,
you'll need something sharp.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.828
What's all that?

11:31.862 --> 11:35.832
Cameras... 20-megapixel,
wireless microphones,

11:35.866 --> 11:38.435
all completely concealable.

11:38.469 --> 11:40.470
What are you gonna do
with them?

11:40.504 --> 11:43.306
I'm gonna prove that Evelyn
and Tony are having an affair.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.675
You think
they're having an affair?

11:45.709 --> 11:47.444
Oh, I know they are...

11:47.478 --> 11:48.678
And so do you.

11:48.712 --> 11:50.246
I never said that.

11:50.281 --> 11:53.149
Poor Valentina...
Incapable of bluffing.

11:53.184 --> 11:55.418
We must play poker some time.

11:55.453 --> 11:56.619
I'm not bluffing.

11:56.654 --> 11:58.721
I just want to stay out of it.

11:58.756 --> 12:01.191
Fine.
I'll install these myself.

12:01.225 --> 12:04.194
Can't you just confront
Mrs. Powell?

12:04.228 --> 12:06.529
Oh, no. That's not how
this game is played.

12:06.564 --> 12:07.764
Game?

12:07.798 --> 12:10.834
I need to catch her
in the unholy act

12:10.868 --> 12:13.903
so she will be crushed
and humiliated,

12:13.938 --> 12:15.238
and I will win.

12:15.306 --> 12:18.908
How can you talk like that
about someone you're married to?

12:18.976 --> 12:20.877
Don't you love
Mrs. Powell?

12:20.911 --> 12:23.880
Our marriage
is not based on love.

12:23.914 --> 12:26.950
And that's why we have
so much fun.

12:35.726 --> 12:37.327
How is he?

12:37.361 --> 12:39.963
Oh.
You're still here.

12:39.997 --> 12:42.031
Of course I am.
You took my car.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.766
Can't talk right now.

12:43.801 --> 12:46.369
I need to get insurance
information for Marisol.

12:46.403 --> 12:47.604
How is Nick?

12:47.671 --> 12:49.572
They need to operate.

12:49.607 --> 12:52.976
I need to ask you something,
mom.

12:54.612 --> 12:57.380
Are you the one
that ran him over?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.687
Why would you do that?

13:04.722 --> 13:06.890
He wanted
to kick us out of our home.

13:06.924 --> 13:08.525
It's his home.

13:08.559 --> 13:10.193
No. We had a deal.

13:10.227 --> 13:13.563
I kept my mouth shut
all these years.

13:13.597 --> 13:14.731
He owes me.

13:14.765 --> 13:16.199
What kind of deal?

13:16.233 --> 13:17.767
He promised
to take care of you.

13:17.801 --> 13:20.803
I made sure that he'd left you
money in his will,

13:20.838 --> 13:23.173
but he was threatening
to leave you with nothing.

13:23.207 --> 13:25.041
I'm in his will?

13:25.075 --> 13:26.576
Yes, my darling.

13:26.610 --> 13:30.079
You are going to be
a rich man one day.

13:30.114 --> 13:34.484
What... what... what am I
supposed to say to that?

13:34.518 --> 13:36.019
Thank you?

13:36.053 --> 13:37.787
Please don't hate me.

13:37.821 --> 13:39.622
Right from the start,

13:39.657 --> 13:42.058
everything I have done
has been for you.

13:42.092 --> 13:46.496
I may not be a good person,
but I am a good mother!

13:57.241 --> 13:58.875
That smells fantastic.

13:58.943 --> 14:00.710
Tastes even better.

14:00.744 --> 14:02.912
Yeah, I can do that for you
if you want.

14:02.947 --> 14:06.182
Oh, that would be great.
I still have to set the table.

14:06.217 --> 14:07.917
Okay.

14:07.952 --> 14:09.552
You're such a gentleman.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.387
Oh, anything for you, milady.

14:23.534 --> 14:25.501
- So, how's the show going?
- Oh, awful.

14:25.536 --> 14:26.603
I got Monday's script...

14:26.637 --> 14:28.304
My character's
illegitimate daughter

14:28.339 --> 14:29.939
is having
an illegitimate daughter.

14:30.007 --> 14:31.574
What's so bad about that?

14:31.609 --> 14:33.943
It's just the idea
of me playing a grandfather.

14:33.978 --> 14:35.211
It really...

14:36.547 --> 14:38.248
Turns your stomach?

14:38.282 --> 14:41.584
Yeah. Yeah.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.820
But, you know,
I've been on the show 20 years,

14:43.854 --> 14:46.689
so I guess it was
bound to happen.

14:46.724 --> 14:49.092
20 years?
That's a big deal.

14:49.126 --> 14:51.227
We should have a party,
you know, to celebrate.

14:55.332 --> 14:56.532
What is this that we're eating?

14:56.567 --> 14:57.600
Sancocho.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.370
It's a traditional
puerto rican stew.

15:02.673 --> 15:03.673
You okay?

15:03.707 --> 15:05.908
You look a little pale.

15:05.943 --> 15:07.210
Well, I would, too,

15:07.278 --> 15:08.978
if I were old enough
to be a grandfather.

15:09.013 --> 15:10.446
Don't be silly.

15:10.481 --> 15:13.716
Men get sexier as they age...
You know, more distinguished.

15:14.885 --> 15:16.319
Something is wrong
with this stew.

15:16.353 --> 15:18.321
Hey, don't insult my homeland.

15:18.355 --> 15:19.722
Tastes great to me.

15:19.757 --> 15:21.791
Good.

15:21.825 --> 15:23.192
Oh, God.

15:23.227 --> 15:24.794
I think I need a bathroom.

15:24.828 --> 15:27.864
Aah!

15:27.898 --> 15:29.332
He must be coming down
with something.

15:29.366 --> 15:30.566
Or it's his age.

15:30.601 --> 15:32.669
You know, old guys, they can't
handle the spicy stuff.

15:32.703 --> 15:33.836
It's sad, really.

15:35.906 --> 15:37.473
Spence?

15:37.508 --> 15:39.909
Did you make it
to the bathroom?

15:39.977 --> 15:42.312
Almost.

15:42.346 --> 15:45.415
Doesn't seem so distinguished
now, does he?

15:50.708 --> 15:51.708
Here we go!

15:52.209 --> 15:53.977
Why are we using paper plates?

15:54.211 --> 15:56.613
My maid is off tonight.

15:56.647 --> 15:57.914
Got it.

15:57.948 --> 15:59.916
Also, I hate doing dishes.

15:59.950 --> 16:03.286
I don't know how you put up
with that as a busboy.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.722
Actually, I'm a chef.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.358
I told her you were Latin
and in the restaurant business.

16:08.392 --> 16:10.193
Here inner racist
took it from there.

16:11.662 --> 16:13.263
I own Agustina in Bel Air.

16:13.297 --> 16:15.131
- Agustina?
- Mm.

16:15.165 --> 16:16.933
You own Agustina?

16:16.967 --> 16:19.769
Now that he's not a busboy,
can we have real plates?

16:19.803 --> 16:21.538
You should drop by.

16:21.572 --> 16:24.240
We just put a chocotorta
on the dessert menu.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.276
That sounds fabulous.

16:26.310 --> 16:28.278
But I don't
know how you work

16:28.312 --> 16:32.482
with butter and cream and still
manage to stay so trim.

16:32.516 --> 16:35.552
Well, I-I try to work out
every day.

16:35.586 --> 16:36.786
You must.

16:36.820 --> 16:39.322
I can't walk by chocolate
without gaining weight.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.090
Aw, I don't believe that
for a second.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.760
God bless pilates.
It saved my life.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.261
Here, feel my bicep.

16:48.832 --> 16:50.233
Okay.

16:50.267 --> 16:53.102
He's fit, you're fit, we're all fit.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.304
Well, I hope I've gotten

16:54.338 --> 16:55.939
your stamp of approval tonight,
Genevieve.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.240
Of course.

16:57.274 --> 17:00.076
You're successful
and charming and handsome.

17:00.110 --> 17:03.813
There's really only one question
in my mind.

17:03.847 --> 17:04.948
What's that?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.517
What are you doing with Zoila?

17:09.019 --> 17:12.521
We tease,
but underneath it all is love.

17:12.556 --> 17:14.357
I know you two
are great friends,

17:14.391 --> 17:17.126
so the next time you come
to my restaurant, it's on me.

17:17.194 --> 17:20.063
You such a doll.

17:20.097 --> 17:22.598
I actually was thinking
of going out next week.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.099
It's my birthday,

17:24.134 --> 17:26.836
though I don't know why
I want to celebrate,

17:26.838 --> 17:28.137
since I'm turning 46.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.306
No, you're not.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.708
What?

17:31.742 --> 17:32.976
You're 61.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.612
- What?
- She's 61.

17:35.646 --> 17:38.147
Well, you look great
for your age.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.816
- Which is 61.
- Zoila.

17:39.883 --> 17:42.352
Relax.
It's like she says...

17:42.386 --> 17:45.822
We tease, but underneath
it all... is love.

17:55.132 --> 17:58.267
Ah. Thank you for coming in,
Ms. Falta.

17:58.335 --> 17:59.902
Please have a seat.

17:59.937 --> 18:02.005
You said it was important?

18:02.039 --> 18:03.806
Is Miguel falling behind?

18:03.841 --> 18:06.743
I know he doesn't speak English
so good.

18:06.777 --> 18:07.877
Well.

18:07.911 --> 18:09.045
Well, what?

18:09.079 --> 18:11.547
He doesn't speak English
so well.

18:11.582 --> 18:12.782
My mistake.

18:12.816 --> 18:16.486
I meant to say
his English is not well.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.589
Moving on.

18:19.623 --> 18:23.860
Miguel is a sweet boy
and typically very polite.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.261
Typically?

18:25.295 --> 18:27.230
There was an incident today.

18:27.264 --> 18:30.700
One of Miguel's classmates
asked for one of his cookies,

18:30.734 --> 18:34.270
and in response,
Miguel called her...

18:34.304 --> 18:37.573
Let me make sure
I'm getting this right...

18:37.608 --> 18:39.409
"A gold-digging whore."

18:43.247 --> 18:47.650
On the bright side,
he's learning English.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.690
Valentina.

18:53.724 --> 18:55.692
Be a dear and put these
in that crystal vase.

18:55.726 --> 18:57.460
They're pretty.
Who sent them?

18:57.528 --> 18:58.561
The staff at Barneys.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.396
They wanted to thank me
for my business.

19:00.464 --> 19:01.431
That's nice.

19:01.465 --> 19:03.066
And totally unexpected.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.133
Last time I dropped in,

19:04.168 --> 19:05.835
there was an incident
with a sales girl.

19:05.869 --> 19:07.403
She asked me
if I was a size eight,

19:07.438 --> 19:08.771
and I reflexively struck her.

19:08.806 --> 19:11.808
I guess all is forgiven
if they're sending me roses.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.378
Anyway,
when you're done with those,

19:15.412 --> 19:16.913
I want you to put them in my room.
No!

19:18.549 --> 19:19.749
I beg your pardon?

19:19.783 --> 19:24.821
The... color is wrong
for your room.

19:24.855 --> 19:26.089
You might have a point.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.024
Tony's room
has shades of yellow.

19:28.058 --> 19:29.058
Put them in there.

19:29.093 --> 19:30.793
No!

19:30.828 --> 19:32.261
Why are you so nervous?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.130
I'm not.

19:34.164 --> 19:37.300
I just feel the roses would
look better in the garage.

19:37.334 --> 19:39.202
Hold it!

19:40.537 --> 19:42.371
Let me see those.

19:46.777 --> 19:49.946
What in God's...

19:49.980 --> 19:52.248
Is that the doorbell?

19:52.282 --> 19:53.382
What's going on here?

19:54.384 --> 19:56.753
So, Adrian knows.

19:57.955 --> 19:59.956
All right, how many camera are?

20:01.024 --> 20:03.159
Dear God. That many?

20:03.193 --> 20:04.260
Mrs. Powell, I'm sorry.

20:04.294 --> 20:06.062
I-I-I really want
to stay out of this.

20:06.096 --> 20:09.031
Oh, of course.

20:09.066 --> 20:10.633
So, what are you gonna do
about the cameras?

20:13.303 --> 20:18.174
Now that I have an audience,
I might as well put on a show.

20:31.054 --> 20:32.455
Hey.
Carmen, where have you been?

20:32.489 --> 20:33.990
I woke up, and nobody was here.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.626
I had to take your Uncle
to the hospital last night.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.728
Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

20:38.762 --> 20:40.062
I hope so.

20:40.097 --> 20:43.065
They're running some tests
to see why he got so sick.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.169
Well, I-I'm sure
it wasn't the stew.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.170
I hope you are right.

20:47.571 --> 20:50.039
So, do you want
to watch a movie?

20:50.073 --> 20:51.974
Now?

20:52.009 --> 20:53.476
Just to get your
mind off things.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.344
We can sit on the sofa,
see what's on cable.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.547
Thanks,
but I have to do the dishes

20:57.581 --> 20:59.215
before your Uncle gets home.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.451
Hello.
H-hey, Spence.

21:02.519 --> 21:03.820
How are you feeling?

21:03.854 --> 21:04.987
Oh, I'm better.

21:05.022 --> 21:07.023
Hey, listen, did you...
did you rinse out that pot

21:07.057 --> 21:08.224
before you made the stew?

21:08.258 --> 21:10.059
Of course. Why?

21:10.093 --> 21:12.695
Well, the doctors think I
ingested some household cleaner.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.531
But if it was in the pot,
wouldn't we all be sick?

21:15.566 --> 21:16.799
Yeah, I know.
It doesn't make sense.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.034
I mean, why was it just me?

21:18.068 --> 21:20.169
I'll talk to the doctors.
Maybe it was something else.

21:20.204 --> 21:22.038
Hey, listen, I got to go.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.273
Okay.

21:24.308 --> 21:27.543
Hey, "Casablanca" is on
in 10 minutes. You in?

21:31.048 --> 21:33.516
Actually,
I-I'm sort of hungry.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.051
Cool. I'll make breakfast.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.019
I don't think I can wait.

21:37.054 --> 21:39.021
And my stew looks so good.

21:39.056 --> 21:41.123
Carmen that's...
That's my Uncle's dish.

21:41.158 --> 21:44.227
So? You said yourself you didn't
think it was why he got sick.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.728
No!

21:45.762 --> 21:48.898
Oh, Ty.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.666
Okay.

21:50.701 --> 21:52.134
Okay, wait.

21:52.169 --> 21:54.237
It was just that cleaning stuff
under the sink.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.205
I didn't think he'd end up
in the hospital.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.875
Why would you do this?

21:58.909 --> 22:01.544
He's trying
to take you away from me.

22:01.578 --> 22:04.714
He doesn't love you like I do.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.718
Carmen, where are you going?

22:08.752 --> 22:10.786
Carmen!

22:22.055 --> 22:23.889
These eggs are dry.

22:23.923 --> 22:25.757
They're the same as always.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.192
And they're always dry.

22:27.227 --> 22:29.294
I've just been too polite
to say anything.

22:29.329 --> 22:30.462
Take them away.

22:32.398 --> 22:34.800
If this is about last night...

22:34.834 --> 22:40.038
All women lie about their age,
and real friends back them up.

22:40.073 --> 22:41.240
Oh, I wasn't thinking.

22:41.274 --> 22:43.575
I was too busy watching you
flirt with my boyfriend.

22:43.610 --> 22:46.044
I wasn't flirting!
I was being delightful.

22:46.079 --> 22:49.248
You can be delightful
without fondling his abs.

22:52.018 --> 22:54.419
You are paranoid, insecure,

22:54.487 --> 22:57.990
and threatened
by my ageless beauty.

22:58.024 --> 23:01.994
It's not ageless!
It's 61!

23:03.730 --> 23:05.664
Hello.

23:05.698 --> 23:08.467
Oh, Dr. Kimball.

23:08.501 --> 23:11.203
Did you get
the test result back?

23:12.905 --> 23:14.606
What?

23:16.242 --> 23:19.177
Sure.
I can come right over.

23:23.383 --> 23:26.285
And another thing
about last night...

23:36.947 --> 23:40.016
You think you deserve a cookie
after what you did today?

23:41.885 --> 23:43.586
I don't think so.

23:43.620 --> 23:46.689
You tell that bitch
to return my damn call!

23:46.723 --> 23:49.258
Here's two cookies.
Go outside.

23:49.293 --> 23:52.228
Well, when she gets her head
out of her butt,

23:52.262 --> 23:53.729
have her call me back.

23:56.366 --> 23:58.000
What the hell's wrong with you?

23:58.035 --> 23:59.969
Miguel got in trouble
at school today

24:00.003 --> 24:02.672
because he said bad words...
Words he learned from you.

24:02.706 --> 24:03.973
Rosie, now is not a good time.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.875
Something's going on
with daddy's bank account,

24:05.909 --> 24:08.010
- and I'm trying to figure it out.
- I mean it!

24:08.045 --> 24:10.079
You can't say those things
in front of him.

24:10.114 --> 24:11.747
Are you telling me how to talk?

24:11.782 --> 24:13.616
I am asking you to be careful.

24:13.650 --> 24:14.717
He's just a child!

24:14.751 --> 24:17.420
I'm the employer,
and you're the employee.

24:17.454 --> 24:19.522
In my house,
I'll behave how I want.

24:19.556 --> 24:22.024
I am the employee,
which means I can leave,

24:22.059 --> 24:24.894
and I will if it's not good
for my son to be here.

24:28.332 --> 24:33.035
Look... I'm sorry.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.304
You mean a lot to me, Rosie.

24:35.339 --> 24:37.573
I would never want
to see you leave.

24:37.608 --> 24:40.710
I'll try to watch my language.

24:40.744 --> 24:42.044
Thank you.

24:42.079 --> 24:46.516
And if you feel like saying
a bad word...

24:46.550 --> 24:48.718
Eat a cookie instead, hmm?

25:00.998 --> 25:02.498
You seem distracted.

25:02.533 --> 25:04.767
I'm thinking about Genevieve.

25:04.801 --> 25:06.636
While I'm kissing you?

25:06.670 --> 25:07.904
That's kinky.

25:07.938 --> 25:09.772
We had a fight today.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.807
Because of last night?

25:11.842 --> 25:14.277
And I shouldn't have
gotten angry.

25:14.311 --> 25:16.612
Genevieve
doesn't mean to flirt.

25:16.647 --> 25:18.414
She just craves attention.

25:18.448 --> 25:20.349
Deep down, she's so sweet.

25:20.384 --> 25:23.186
Sounds like she's more
than a boss to you.

25:23.220 --> 25:26.455
And Genevieve can be
silly and self-absorbed,

25:26.490 --> 25:30.092
but I depend on her in ways
you can't even imagine.

25:30.127 --> 25:31.827
Wow.

25:31.862 --> 25:35.331
But in the middle of our fight,
she just left.

25:35.399 --> 25:36.966
That's not like her.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.169
So you're worried about her?

25:40.204 --> 25:41.270
Yeah.

25:41.305 --> 25:46.409
Thank you for being
such a good listener.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.348
And a good kisser.

25:54.351 --> 25:56.352
Can I assume
you're thinking about me now?

25:56.386 --> 25:58.187
Definitely.

26:05.229 --> 26:06.929
Who was that?

26:06.964 --> 26:08.464
The police.

26:08.498 --> 26:10.666
Some detectives
are on their way over.

26:10.701 --> 26:13.069
Why?

26:13.103 --> 26:15.504
I'm sure they have questions
about Nicholas.

26:15.539 --> 26:18.641
It would be helpful
if I had an alibi.

26:18.675 --> 26:21.377
I guess I could help you out...

26:21.445 --> 26:24.046
Under one condition.

26:24.081 --> 26:26.415
You're bargaining with me?

26:26.450 --> 26:28.751
You like to make deals,
don't you?

26:28.785 --> 26:32.088
What do you want?

26:32.122 --> 26:36.058
I'll tell the police
you were here all night

26:36.093 --> 26:38.094
if you agree to leave.

26:38.128 --> 26:39.829
Leave?

26:39.863 --> 26:41.497
Move out. Exit my life.

26:41.531 --> 26:43.232
Ethan.

26:43.267 --> 26:45.568
I've been lying for you
since I was five.

26:45.602 --> 26:47.603
I'm tired of being
your accomplice.

26:47.638 --> 26:49.672
But everything
that I have done...

26:49.706 --> 26:52.108
Has been for me.
Got it.

26:52.142 --> 26:54.710
Ethan, this is my home.

26:54.745 --> 26:56.178
I wouldn't know where to go.

26:56.213 --> 26:58.314
If you're smart enough
to get away with murder,

26:58.348 --> 27:00.583
I'm sure you could figure out
how to rent a condo.

27:00.617 --> 27:03.085
Don't you love me?

27:03.120 --> 27:04.754
I do, mom.

27:06.456 --> 27:09.292
But I'm tired
of carrying around your secrets.

27:09.326 --> 27:11.360
I've got my own to worry about.

27:19.813 --> 27:22.314
I'm telling you, Kenny,

27:22.348 --> 27:24.583
it was awful the way Lucinda
was screaming at her.

27:24.651 --> 27:28.720
Finally, poor Rosie said
she might have to quit.

27:33.927 --> 27:36.128
Now, I know you love Rosie

27:36.162 --> 27:38.363
and that sweet little boy
of hers.

27:39.432 --> 27:42.201
It would be such a shame
to see her go.

27:44.270 --> 27:46.471
What should I do?

27:46.506 --> 27:50.509
Sometimes the best thing
we can do for our children

27:50.543 --> 27:53.245
is to push them
out of the nest.

28:04.624 --> 28:06.792
Uncle Spence, you're back.

28:06.826 --> 28:07.926
Sit down.

28:07.961 --> 28:09.661
We need to talk.

28:09.696 --> 28:13.465
Look, I don't know what Carmen
told you, but I can explain.

28:13.499 --> 28:15.334
Your mother's on her way over.

28:15.368 --> 28:16.969
She's gonna take you home.

28:17.003 --> 28:19.004
But she's still in New York.

28:19.038 --> 28:20.138
Well, I called her.

28:20.173 --> 28:22.441
She left on
the first available flight.

28:22.475 --> 28:25.844
I don't want to go back home.

28:25.879 --> 28:28.714
Well, for obvious reasons,

28:28.748 --> 28:30.582
I can't let you
stay here anymore.

28:30.617 --> 28:33.719
So you can have Carmen
all to yourself?

28:36.956 --> 28:39.124
Listen to me carefully...

28:39.158 --> 28:41.693
Carmen and I are not
romantically involved.

28:41.728 --> 28:44.162
I don't believe you.

28:44.197 --> 28:46.531
That's because you're confused.

28:46.566 --> 28:48.934
Hey, your mom and I
are gonna make sure

28:48.968 --> 28:50.302
that you get the help
that you need.

28:51.971 --> 28:54.706
I want to talk to Carmen.

28:54.741 --> 28:57.109
She refuses to step into
this house until you're gone.

28:57.143 --> 28:58.677
That's how much
you've upset her.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.316
You're lying.

29:04.350 --> 29:06.685
Carmen loves me.

29:06.719 --> 29:09.454
No, she doesn't.

29:17.397 --> 29:19.898
Sweetness?

29:19.933 --> 29:21.767
I have an appointment
with my new therapist.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.535
Would you mind if I had
Valentina drive me?

29:23.603 --> 29:25.837
Why not have Tony take you?

29:25.872 --> 29:28.173
Well, I just asked Tony
to fix that lock I broke.

29:28.207 --> 29:29.308
That could take a while.

29:30.610 --> 29:33.145
Come along, Valentina.

29:39.349 --> 29:41.695
_

29:52.432 --> 29:53.666
Why are we stopping here?

29:53.700 --> 29:55.868
Your appointment's at 3:00.
We're gonna be late.

29:55.902 --> 29:57.036
There is no appointment.

29:57.070 --> 29:58.203
What is that?

29:58.238 --> 30:00.539
We're gonna watch
a little something

30:00.573 --> 30:02.041
on the adultery channel.

30:02.075 --> 30:03.742
- Mr. Powell!
- Shh. Shh.

30:03.777 --> 30:07.212
It's show time.

30:07.247 --> 30:09.982
I fixed the lock
for Mr. Powell.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.985
Now, if there is anything
I can do for you...

30:13.019 --> 30:15.020
Absolutely.

30:16.256 --> 30:18.223
You can take me shopping.

30:19.559 --> 30:22.628
See?
There's nothing going on.

30:22.662 --> 30:24.530
No.

30:24.564 --> 30:26.432
She knows there's a camera.
Why do you say that?

30:26.466 --> 30:29.535
She kept turning to her left.
That's her good side.

30:29.569 --> 30:31.870
She thinks
that she can outsmart me?

30:31.905 --> 30:35.207
I will get her,
get her, get her.

30:35.241 --> 30:36.408
Follow them.

30:37.977 --> 30:39.478
Okay, but at some point,

30:39.512 --> 30:42.181
you really will need
to see your therapist.

30:49.656 --> 30:52.424
If there are cameras
all over the house,

30:52.459 --> 30:54.326
does that mean
our playtime is over?

30:54.360 --> 30:55.461
No.

30:55.495 --> 30:57.830
It just means we won't be
doing it in the house.

30:57.864 --> 30:59.698
You want to go to hotel?

30:59.733 --> 31:00.766
We might be seen.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
A motel?

31:01.835 --> 31:03.302
I'd rather be celibate.

31:03.336 --> 31:05.671
Then what do you have in mind?

31:05.705 --> 31:08.207
I'm fairly sure
Adrian didn't think

31:08.241 --> 31:10.309
to put a camera in the car.

31:28.061 --> 31:31.864
Why are they pulling over?

31:31.898 --> 31:34.166
That's why.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.834
Stay here.

31:35.869 --> 31:38.003
The game is about to end...

31:38.037 --> 31:40.906
And I will be merciless
in victory.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.816
Come on, Mr. Powell.
Let's go home.

32:32.393 --> 32:34.327
There you are.

32:34.362 --> 32:36.196
Where did you go this morning?

32:36.230 --> 32:38.999
Oh, uh, Dr. Kimball
needed to see me.

32:39.033 --> 32:41.334
Why? What's wrong?

32:41.369 --> 32:43.170
There's a problem
with my kidneys.

32:43.171 --> 32:46.509
It seems the little buggers
are starting to shut down.

32:48.379 --> 32:53.783
- Oh, my God.
- So I have to start dialysis.

32:53.818 --> 32:55.185
Then that's what you'll do.

32:55.219 --> 32:58.254
Lots of people do that, right?
It's not life-threatening.

32:58.289 --> 33:00.890
It can be...

33:00.925 --> 33:04.127
Especially for people my age.

33:04.161 --> 33:07.931
And we both know
I'm not 46 anymore.

33:07.965 --> 33:11.267
Well, I'm not worried.

33:11.302 --> 33:12.769
You're gonna be okay.

33:12.803 --> 33:15.371
How can you be so sure?

33:15.406 --> 33:19.342
Because I need you to be okay.

33:19.376 --> 33:23.246
Well, in that case...

33:23.280 --> 33:27.183
Listen, you're coming with me
to Javier's restaurant tonight.

33:27.218 --> 33:30.620
I didn't think you wanted me
to be around your boyfriend.

33:30.654 --> 33:33.289
Well, I have no choice.
He's insisting.

33:33.324 --> 33:35.558
Apparently, he has
a little crush on you.

33:35.593 --> 33:37.761
Oh?

33:37.795 --> 33:40.730
We'll leave at 7:00,
okay?

33:45.936 --> 33:48.605
Zoila.

33:48.639 --> 33:51.040
You know what I like best
about you?

33:52.676 --> 33:55.678
You always know the exact
right time to lie to me.

34:11.661 --> 34:13.196
Hey, Ms. Lucinda.

34:13.230 --> 34:15.098
Are you taking a trip?

34:15.132 --> 34:17.801
My father kicked me out
of this house because of you.

34:17.835 --> 34:20.469
What?

34:20.504 --> 34:22.639
He accused me of being abusive
to the help.

34:22.672 --> 34:24.340
Then he told me
to pack my bags.

34:24.375 --> 34:27.010
I didn't say anything
to Mr. Kenneth, I swear.

34:27.043 --> 34:30.847
The worst part is... I thought
you were my friend, Rosie.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.047
I am.

34:33.449 --> 34:34.918
Please, don't go.

34:34.952 --> 34:36.351
Let me talk to your father.

34:36.387 --> 34:38.021
Don't pretend to care about me!

34:38.054 --> 34:40.422
You're just another snake
in this nest of vipers.

34:40.456 --> 34:42.425
Well, I'm tired of getting bit.

34:42.458 --> 34:44.960
You can go to hell
with the rest of them!

34:47.998 --> 34:49.966
Damn!

34:59.607 --> 35:01.275
We have to talk
to Mr. Kenneth.

35:01.309 --> 35:02.376
Why?

35:02.410 --> 35:03.877
He's making miss Lucinda
leave the house.

35:03.912 --> 35:05.946
Uncle Ken has
made up his mind already.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.114
You'll just upset him.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.749
But is he doing this for me?

35:08.783 --> 35:10.284
I don't want her to leave.

35:12.587 --> 35:13.787
It's Didi.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.924
You know she's hated Lucinda
from day one.

35:16.958 --> 35:18.492
And when Didi heard her
yelling at you,

35:18.526 --> 35:20.260
she used that as an excuse
to get rid of her.

35:20.295 --> 35:22.429
- That's horrible.
- I know.

35:22.463 --> 35:26.099
But that's Didi...
Self-serving, manipulative.

35:26.134 --> 35:28.535
I don't envy you,
having to live with her.

35:28.570 --> 35:30.971
I wish she was the one
going away.

35:31.005 --> 35:34.107
Well,
if you keep your ears open,

35:34.142 --> 35:37.444
an opportunity
might present itself.

35:44.352 --> 35:45.952
Hey, I've been thinking.

35:45.987 --> 35:48.488
Maybe now is not the right time
to have a party.

35:48.523 --> 35:49.956
Well, you need something

35:49.991 --> 35:52.359
to take your mind off
all this drama with Ty.

35:52.393 --> 35:55.495
And a fabulous show-biz party
is just what the doctor ordered.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.998
Maybe you're right.

35:58.032 --> 35:59.165
You doing okay?

35:59.200 --> 36:00.634
Yeah.

36:26.727 --> 36:30.196
I took the liberty
of buying you a bouquet.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.198
Oh, thank you.

36:32.233 --> 36:36.503
This is unexpected.

36:36.537 --> 36:39.873
I'm sure this will be, too.

36:39.907 --> 36:42.809
I'm moving out tonight.

36:42.843 --> 36:44.878
It's time.

36:44.912 --> 36:48.214
I have a job opportunity, so...

36:48.249 --> 36:50.250
Wow.

36:50.284 --> 36:53.086
I do have a favor to ask.

36:55.222 --> 36:58.024
I'd like Ethan to continue
living with you.

36:58.059 --> 37:00.460
He's still in school and...

37:00.494 --> 37:03.501
It's no problem.
Of course.

37:03.535 --> 37:07.238
I hope you know
I like Ethan very much.

37:07.272 --> 37:10.341
He's a wonderful boy.

37:10.375 --> 37:13.077
I'm sure you're gonna miss him.

37:13.111 --> 37:16.247
He's my life.

37:18.050 --> 37:19.684
Marisol?

37:19.718 --> 37:23.120
We're ready.

37:25.524 --> 37:27.124
For what it's worth,

37:27.159 --> 37:30.661
I'm really sorry
that we couldn't be friends.

37:30.696 --> 37:34.665
It was always
such a complicated situation.

37:45.010 --> 37:48.613
Under unusual circumstances,
we're gathered here

37:48.647 --> 37:52.383
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

37:52.417 --> 37:54.518
Do you, Nicholas,
take this woman

37:54.553 --> 37:57.455
for better or for worse,
for richer...

38:00.626 --> 38:02.460
Tell me.

38:02.494 --> 38:03.594
Is she...?

38:03.629 --> 38:05.396
She's dead.

38:05.430 --> 38:06.430
Oh, dear God.

38:06.465 --> 38:08.499
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

38:08.533 --> 38:09.867
You have to believe me.

38:09.901 --> 38:12.370
Ethan, go back to the car.

38:12.404 --> 38:15.840
Now!

38:19.845 --> 38:22.613
W... what are you doing?

38:22.648 --> 38:24.048
I'm calling the police.

38:24.082 --> 38:26.384
I can't go to jail.
My son needs me.

38:26.418 --> 38:28.286
You should have thought of that
before threw her off a bridge.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.054
I...

38:30.088 --> 38:31.355
Don't be stupid.

38:31.390 --> 38:34.725
This is the perfect time
to strike a bargain.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.827
A bargain?

38:36.862 --> 38:41.932
If you keep your mouth shut,
I'd be inclined to do the same.

38:41.967 --> 38:44.268
What is it you think you know?

38:44.303 --> 38:46.704
Dahlia told me everything...

38:46.738 --> 38:50.107
What happened,
how you covered it up.

38:50.142 --> 38:52.576
It'd be your word against mine.

38:52.611 --> 38:55.513
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.584
What do you want?

39:00.619 --> 39:06.387
Provide for me and my son
for the rest of our lives.

39:06.758 --> 39:10.461
In exchange, I won't tell
your friends and neighbors

39:10.495 --> 39:11.862
you're a murderer.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.300
What do you want me to say?

39:18.036 --> 39:19.437
She jumped.

39:34.386 --> 39:36.987
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

39:37.022 --> 39:39.190
You may kiss the bride.
