[bag zipping]

01:32.043 --> 01:33.127
Come on, time to go!

01:33.211 --> 01:34.838
[girl] I'm gonna kill you
if you don't leave me alone.

01:34.921 --> 01:36.172
Come on!

01:38.925 --> 01:40.051
Let's go! Let's go!

01:40.134 --> 01:42.095
- Okay! We're coming. Relax, Phil.
- [chuckling]

01:42.178 --> 01:43.179
Where's your sister?

01:43.262 --> 01:44.388
- Farting in her room.
- Ugh, Phil.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.974
It's time to go, honey!

01:46.057 --> 01:47.892
- [girl] I know, I'm coming! God!
- Come on.

01:55.733 --> 01:57.025
[door opens]

01:58.027 --> 02:00.613
We're gonna leave without you, Jessie!

02:01.614 --> 02:04.200
[young Jessica] Twelve hours
in a car with you? [sighs]

02:04.283 --> 02:06.953
Fine, leave without me.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.415
[door closing]

02:13.251 --> 02:15.586
Welcome home, Jessica Jones.

02:20.049 --> 02:22.886
- My home never had an armed guard.
- Well, that's Hank.

02:22.969 --> 02:25.972
- Say hi, Hank.
- Hi, Hank.

02:26.055 --> 02:28.391
Sorry, I slip sometimes.

02:28.474 --> 02:30.393
Don't misunderstand.
Hank's here because he's paid.

02:30.476 --> 02:32.896
A lot. Safety first.

02:32.979 --> 02:35.314
I wouldn't have walked in the door
if I was going to attack you.

02:35.398 --> 02:37.691
Well, then you won't mind
if Hank searches you.

02:37.775 --> 02:38.985
I mind!

02:41.070 --> 02:42.530
I'm not gonna command it.

02:42.613 --> 02:45.574
I was serious when I said
I wanted you to choose.

02:45.658 --> 02:48.661
[inhales] But trust is a two-way street.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.915
Look for any sharps or drugs.

02:51.998 --> 02:55.209
That Sufentanil you shot me with
gave me a wicked headache.

03:00.798 --> 03:02.216
<i>I am Jessica Jones.</i>

03:02.300 --> 03:05.344
<i>This is a one-party consent
to record conversations with Kilgrave</i>

03:05.428 --> 03:09.432
<i>in order to get his confession to
the murders of Hope Shlottman's parents.</i>

03:11.017 --> 03:13.269
You know how I feel about being recorded.

03:13.978 --> 03:15.229
[cell phone beeps]

03:18.107 --> 03:20.109
So you came here for a confession?

03:20.193 --> 03:23.696
I came here to end the collateral damage
you've been piling up around me.

03:23.779 --> 03:26.407
The confession was a last ditch.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.411
I knew it wasn't out of love.
I'm not delusional.

03:30.494 --> 03:32.663
Just optimistic.

03:34.123 --> 03:36.250
I'll show you around.

03:36.334 --> 03:38.586
- You want me to choose?
- Yes.

03:38.669 --> 03:40.713
I choose that you don't touch me.

03:40.796 --> 03:42.881
- Oh, please...
- Ever!

03:46.052 --> 03:50.681
I promise I won't touch you
until I get your genuine consent.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.517
All right, then?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.269
Welcome.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.557
A time-honored tradition
by families everywhere.

04:34.892 --> 04:35.893
Not mine, of course.

04:35.977 --> 04:38.687
My parents wouldn't dare
let their walls be defaced.

04:59.417 --> 05:01.210
[scoffs]

05:01.294 --> 05:03.962
- It's the same one.
- Wasn't easy to find.

05:04.047 --> 05:06.049
Mid '90s Sears and Roebuck furniture set.

05:06.132 --> 05:07.508
How did you know?

05:07.591 --> 05:10.594
I found the realtor who sold this place
after your parents died.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.305
She had pictures.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.311
You shouldn't have.

05:18.977 --> 05:20.396
I wanted to.

05:25.568 --> 05:28.779
When we were together,
I asked what your happiest memories were.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.863
You said?

05:32.616 --> 05:34.035
- Home.
- Home.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.538
I'll introduce you to the staff.

05:43.336 --> 05:45.045
This is, um...

05:45.129 --> 05:47.005
Tell her your names, please.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.550
- Laurent Bouchard.
- Alva Ramirez.

05:49.633 --> 05:52.470
I will not stay in a house with slaves.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.306
Oh, now you're just being sanctimonious.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.185
Tell Jessica whether or not
you are happy with your salary.

05:59.268 --> 06:01.979
Absolutely.
I make twice as much as my last job,

06:02.062 --> 06:04.773
from which I was fired
due to a drinking problem.

06:04.857 --> 06:08.152
See? Some of us give people
a second chance.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.280
That's all.
You may leave.

06:18.787 --> 06:20.456
I'm tired.

06:20.539 --> 06:22.875
Your room awaits.

06:29.257 --> 06:30.341
Shared bathroom.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.010
It's quite the cozy home
you had back in the day.

06:39.142 --> 06:42.019
- This was little Phillip's room.
- No.

06:43.146 --> 06:44.147
Ah...

06:45.148 --> 06:47.358
Lot of feelings for the dead brother, huh?

06:47.441 --> 06:48.651
I get that.

06:49.693 --> 06:53.156
You're not all hard edges,
Jessica Jones.

06:53.239 --> 06:55.491
Now for the coup de grÃ¢ce.

07:12.049 --> 07:13.967
I worked hard on this.

07:16.262 --> 07:20.474
I used a magnifying glass on the pictures
of your room to ID the CDs.

07:28.566 --> 07:30.609
Yeah. Just where you left them.

07:31.527 --> 07:33.654
Oh, Jesus, Jessica.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.241
A little appreciation
wouldn't hurt anyone.

07:38.867 --> 07:41.078
P.I. bug got you early, huh?

07:42.955 --> 07:45.333
Just imagine little 14-year-old you.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.961
- Peeping in on the neighbors.
- [scoffs]

07:49.044 --> 07:50.921
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.674
We all like to see what goes on
behind closed doors.

07:53.757 --> 07:55.217
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Oh!

07:57.761 --> 07:59.137
It's Patsy!

08:00.055 --> 08:01.599
[Jessica sighs]

08:02.683 --> 08:04.101
Answer if you want to.

08:06.229 --> 08:07.896
You're not my prisoner. Here.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.942
[Trish] <i>Jess?</i>
<i>Jess, what the hell is going on?</i>

08:12.025 --> 08:13.110
I'm here.

08:13.194 --> 08:15.238
<i>Jess, I called the precinct.
You're not in jail.</i>

08:15.321 --> 08:16.822
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

08:19.367 --> 08:21.660
Kilgrave showed up at the station.

08:21.744 --> 08:23.537
[stammers] Are you all right?
Was anyone hurt?

08:23.621 --> 08:26.665
<i>No... but I had to get out of there.</i>

08:26.749 --> 08:30.043
I left the city as fast as I could.
I'm sorry, I should've called.

08:30.127 --> 08:31.544
[whispers] Do you want to invite her over?

08:31.629 --> 08:34.172
<i>Well, how do I know
that this is not like last time...</i>

08:34.256 --> 08:37.342
when he had you acting
like everything was fine?

08:37.426 --> 08:41.972
Because Kilgrave is a psychotic,
repulsive waste of a human being,

08:42.054 --> 08:45.351
and if I were under his control,
he would never let me say that.

08:45.434 --> 08:46.435
<i>You'll need money.</i>

08:47.353 --> 08:48.771
I'm covered.

08:50.022 --> 08:52.941
Just let me do this, okay, Trish?

08:53.025 --> 08:54.985
<i>Everyone's disappearing.</i>

08:56.153 --> 08:57.238
Everyone?

08:58.155 --> 08:59.698
Simpson's gone.

09:00.991 --> 09:03.702
He put in a leave of absence at work
and then flat-out disappeared.

09:03.786 --> 09:05.496
<i>I'm worried Kilgrave's got him.</i>

09:08.457 --> 09:10.376
He'll show up.
I'll be in touch, okay?

09:11.960 --> 09:13.837
I'm tired of missing you.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.383
I gotta go.

09:21.387 --> 09:24.807
Oof. Rough being your friend.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.726
Now, this is for you.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.774
Laurent and what's-her-name
are cooking up a storm for us.

09:33.857 --> 09:37.027
You're welcome to come down
whenever you're hungry.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.031
[locks door]

09:49.873 --> 09:53.586
Well, I suppose that went
as well as could be expected.

10:18.569 --> 10:20.238
[sighs]

10:28.829 --> 10:31.206
[breathes deeply]

10:40.508 --> 10:42.093
[glass clinking]

10:46.138 --> 10:48.556
[sighs] How do you people live like this?

10:48.641 --> 10:51.477
Day after day, just hoping
people are gonna do what you want.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.103
It's unbearable.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.398
- [sighs]
- [door opens]

10:56.482 --> 10:57.733
Finally.

10:58.651 --> 11:00.569
[footsteps approaching]

11:12.956 --> 11:15.876
- No dress?
- Purple's not really my color.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.264
So is this bag of steroids
always going to be lurking?

11:30.808 --> 11:33.936
You're right. This is awkward enough
without armed guards hovering over dinner.

11:34.019 --> 11:35.395
You can leave.

11:41.318 --> 11:45.113
So, what exactly are you hoping
is going to happen here?

11:45.197 --> 11:48.241
That you and I will
eventually make a go of it.

11:49.618 --> 11:50.828
Not gonna happen.

11:50.911 --> 11:55.666
Well, this is a weird, wild world
where anything can happen.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.750
Look at us.

11:56.834 --> 11:59.545
Super strength and mind control
in the same house. Amazing.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.214
Regardless, dinner is ready.

12:02.297 --> 12:05.968
I've had Chef Bouchard prepare
your favorite meal, Pasta Amatriciana.

12:06.051 --> 12:08.471
That's your favorite meal.
Now, it makes me nauseous.

12:08.554 --> 12:10.473
I'll be having a liquid dinner.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.032
Another bottle, please.

12:32.244 --> 12:33.662
You ever think you might drink too much?

12:33.746 --> 12:37.541
It's the only way I get through
my goddamn days after what you did to me.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.668
You blame me for your drinking problem?

12:40.794 --> 12:43.964
- It's the truth.
- Come on, it wasn't all bad.

12:44.047 --> 12:46.509
I mean, certainly it ended roughly.

12:48.260 --> 12:52.305
You call making me murder a woman
"ending roughly"?

12:52.389 --> 12:53.473
Now, now, let's be clear.

12:53.557 --> 12:55.976
- I did not tell you to kill Reva.
- What?

12:56.059 --> 12:58.061
If you remember, I said,
"Take care of her."

12:58.145 --> 12:59.730
Not kill her.
You chose to punch her.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.314
You goddamn son of a bitch!

13:01.398 --> 13:02.690
[bottle shattering]

13:12.743 --> 13:14.787
I knew you had a safeguard in place.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.622
A-ha, testing boundaries, were you?

13:16.705 --> 13:19.625
Smart. I didn't see that coming.

13:19.708 --> 13:21.544
One of the many reasons I like you.

13:21.627 --> 13:23.503
You said you weren't
going to use your powers.

13:23.587 --> 13:24.880
I said I wouldn't control you.

13:29.217 --> 13:30.969
You can stop with the razors.

13:32.763 --> 13:36.141
They're in place until
we've built some trust.

13:36.224 --> 13:38.560
- Until I choose you?
- [chuckles]

13:38.644 --> 13:43.106
You really do have a knack for destroying
the poetry of the heart, don't you?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.566
[Kilgrave tutting]

13:44.650 --> 13:47.485
Clean up the mess that our guest has made.

13:50.322 --> 13:52.866
I'm full and I'm tired.

13:55.953 --> 13:57.537
I'm sorry.

13:59.832 --> 14:01.584
[footsteps receding]

14:07.547 --> 14:08.840
[exhales]

14:22.646 --> 14:25.107
[door creaking]

14:30.153 --> 14:31.363
[gasps]

14:32.280 --> 14:35.117
- What the hell are you doing?
- [whispers] I'm getting you out of here.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.285
- You're under his control.
- No, I'm not.

14:38.579 --> 14:39.913
That's what he'd make you say.

14:41.498 --> 14:45.586
I'm not under his control.
I know what I'm doing.

14:45.669 --> 14:46.670
Ow!

14:46.754 --> 14:48.297
[Jessica grunts]

14:48.380 --> 14:51.008
[Kilgrave]
Is everything all right up there?

14:51.091 --> 14:55.053
I tripped. I'm drunk.
Just stay out of my shit!

14:55.137 --> 14:56.179
[Simpson grunts]

14:58.724 --> 15:01.852
I'm not under his goddamn control
or I would have given you up.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.354
- You have to get out of here!
- You're coming with me.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.650
I put a bomb in the basement to kill
that asshole downstairs.

15:07.733 --> 15:09.567
Shit!

15:09.652 --> 15:10.903
[Simpson grunting]

15:12.112 --> 15:13.196
[locks door]

15:14.615 --> 15:17.910
You can't kill him
with Hope still in jail.

15:17.993 --> 15:20.037
Well, you can't let him live.
He's too dangerous.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.205
There are innocent people
living in this house.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.582
Well, I'll time the explosion
to when they take out the trash.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.711
No! I am handling it.

15:27.795 --> 15:29.046
You kill him and you kill me,

15:29.129 --> 15:31.381
and I will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

15:34.009 --> 15:35.260
What're you...

15:35.886 --> 15:37.971
I'm keeping this.

15:38.055 --> 15:42.267
I am here because I have to be,
because I want to be.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.269
You have to leave, now.

15:44.352 --> 15:45.770
- [knock on door]
- [Kilgrave] Jessica?

15:45.854 --> 15:46.897
[Jessica] Shit.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.734
I hope everything's all right.

15:50.818 --> 15:53.570
It isn't. There's a bomb in the basement.

15:53.654 --> 15:54.947
Get Hank.

16:00.077 --> 16:01.244
[sighs]

16:01.328 --> 16:02.746
Found it.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.169
Remote detonation.

16:09.252 --> 16:12.214
Small charge hits the gas main...
whole house goes up.

16:12.297 --> 16:14.842
- Looks like a tragic accident.
- [Kilgrave] Can you dismantle it?

16:15.467 --> 16:17.720
Somebody really does
have it out for you, boss.

16:17.803 --> 16:19.805
That someone got past your security team.

16:19.888 --> 16:22.015
Fire last night's shift,
bring in a better crew.

16:22.099 --> 16:24.017
- Yes, sir.
- Leave.

16:29.773 --> 16:32.943
- You knew it was here?
- Lucky guess.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.864
Well, my lucky guess is that it was
Trish's missing Officer Simpson.

16:36.947 --> 16:40.200
He would have killed
sweet little Alva and Laurent, too.

16:40.283 --> 16:42.285
You've killed more people
as an afterthought.

16:42.369 --> 16:46.289
- I've never killed anyone.
- You use your powers to compel murder.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.833
- Oh, tomato, to-mato.
- [scoffs]

16:48.917 --> 16:51.461
What matters is you saved my life.

16:53.338 --> 16:54.464
You do care for me.

16:55.382 --> 16:59.219
I just can't handle
another death on my conscience.

16:59.302 --> 17:00.637
Even if it's yours.

17:00.721 --> 17:03.306
You'd know the feeling
if you had a conscience.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.559
I have a conscience.
It's... just more selective.

17:08.145 --> 17:10.646
I care if you die.

17:10.731 --> 17:12.190
The rest are fungible.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.362
I shall see you in the morning.

17:24.536 --> 17:27.704
[Kilgrave on recording]
<i>I care if you die. The rest are fungible.</i>

17:31.084 --> 17:34.004
[Desmond] <i>70% of Miss Hogarth's</i>
<i>holdings is ridiculous.</i>

17:34.087 --> 17:36.589
I mean, you can't be serious.

17:36.673 --> 17:39.092
Why don't you tell him
how serious I am, Jeri?

17:39.176 --> 17:42.429
Or do you want to send in your private eye
to threaten me again?

17:42.512 --> 17:44.264
Wait, what?
Who threatened you?

17:44.347 --> 17:47.434
Do you want to tell everyone,
or do you want to revise the agreement?

17:47.517 --> 17:49.602
I didn't send anyone, Wendy.

17:49.686 --> 17:52.856
I fell in love with someone else.
That doesn't make me a monster.

17:52.940 --> 17:55.192
No, not a monster.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.693
The word I'd use is "bastard."

17:56.777 --> 17:59.280
[Desmond] Okay, name-calling
isn't going to get this done.

17:59.362 --> 18:02.199
Even when we were dating,
everyone wanted to know what I saw in you.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.076
Then why did you marry me?

18:05.493 --> 18:08.163
Because you were kind to me.

18:08.914 --> 18:13.085
You were a bastard to everyone else,
and you were kind to me.

18:13.168 --> 18:14.711
I was special.

18:15.503 --> 18:16.546
Well, I liked you.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.215
Mmm.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.052
And I like you when you aren't trying
to take my livelihood.

18:23.386 --> 18:25.013
But you don't love me anymore.

18:27.515 --> 18:30.435
Do you still want that?
[stammers] After all of this?

18:31.728 --> 18:33.313
You want that?

18:33.396 --> 18:34.439
No.

18:36.358 --> 18:37.609
It's too late.

18:38.735 --> 18:41.321
[Wendy's lawyer] If your client really
has been strong-arming my client...

18:41.404 --> 18:43.949
[Desmond] Strong-arming?
As in demanding 70% of her assets?

18:44.032 --> 18:46.493
Until that second in the subway,
I still held out hope.

18:46.576 --> 18:48.954
- Mid-life crisis...
- Wendy, don't do this to yourself.

18:49.037 --> 18:51.331
I built everything around you...

18:51.414 --> 18:52.707
and now you're not there.

18:54.376 --> 18:57.337
You have Pam,
and I have nothing.

18:59.714 --> 19:01.090
[sighs]

19:01.174 --> 19:02.926
I'm sorry.

19:04.552 --> 19:09.682
Well, I'm going to have to ask you
to say that with cash.

19:11.143 --> 19:12.269
- Okay.
- [knocking on door]

19:13.186 --> 19:14.729
There's a text for you, Miss Hogarth.

19:14.812 --> 19:16.356
[snickers]

19:16.439 --> 19:17.983
Nice.

19:18.066 --> 19:19.776
You call her that in bed, too?

19:19.860 --> 19:21.528
Is that why she's the special one now?

19:21.611 --> 19:24.447
I need to take care of this.
You keep going.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.074
- You know what I want.
- Okay.

19:29.661 --> 19:31.746
I can't believe
you were ever married to her.

19:31.829 --> 19:33.706
- Why did you pull me out of there?
- It's Jessica.

19:33.790 --> 19:36.126
Oh, thank God.
Did she dig something up on Wendy?

19:36.209 --> 19:38.128
No. It's a message.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.671
She's with Kilgrave.

19:41.173 --> 19:42.257
[man] So, what are you looking at?

19:42.340 --> 19:43.633
[Simpson] Can't tell you
anything right now.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.636
Let's just get back to my place,
and let me explain it.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.263
[man] All right.

19:48.346 --> 19:50.015
- Will!
- Oh, shoot.

19:50.098 --> 19:51.766
Oh, hey.
Uh, you guys go in...

19:51.849 --> 19:53.226
- Uh, go on in.
- Who's she?

19:53.310 --> 19:55.187
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just bug out.

19:56.479 --> 19:57.814
Hey, babe.

19:57.898 --> 19:59.567
- [exhales sharply]
- You look amazing.

20:00.525 --> 20:01.859
Is everything all right?

20:01.944 --> 20:03.153
Who are those guys?

20:03.236 --> 20:06.656
A couple of my boys from back in the day.
You know, they came to town.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.408
- [stammers] What's up?
- "What's up?"

20:08.491 --> 20:12.620
Last time we talked, you were hunting
a homicidal mind-control maniac,

20:12.704 --> 20:15.332
and then it's crickets from you. I...

20:15.415 --> 20:17.417
[scoffs] I'm not wrong to be concerned.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.627
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

20:21.629 --> 20:22.965
I lost him, so...

20:23.048 --> 20:25.383
So, you came home?

20:25.467 --> 20:27.677
Look, Kilgrave is gone.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.930
He's out of the city.

20:30.013 --> 20:31.639
How do you know that if you lost him?

20:31.723 --> 20:34.226
[stammer] Babe,
we're free of him now, okay?

20:34.309 --> 20:35.435
We can be together.

20:35.518 --> 20:38.521
Not yet.
Jessica is still on the run from him.

20:40.148 --> 20:41.524
She told you this?

20:41.608 --> 20:44.902
She can't come back until he's caught.
It's up to us now.

20:44.987 --> 20:48.573
No, it's not, 'cause Jess can
take care of herself.

20:48.656 --> 20:51.701
In fact, she can do that
a lot better than we can, right?

20:51.784 --> 20:52.785
I doubt that.

20:52.869 --> 20:55.788
No, listen to me,
because I see this now.

20:55.872 --> 20:59.001
Everyone wants to be the hero, right?

20:59.084 --> 21:01.878
But now I see that we can't be...

21:01.962 --> 21:05.132
because there's us and there's them.

21:05.215 --> 21:06.967
And that's okay,

21:07.050 --> 21:08.885
but it just means
that we can't always help.

21:08.969 --> 21:10.803
You can't always help.

21:10.887 --> 21:14.682
Not without getting hurt
and becoming some extra problem.

21:14.766 --> 21:18.186
You're saying this like it's about me,
but this is about you.

21:19.187 --> 21:20.397
You're abandoning her.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.233
No, I'm getting out of her way.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.318
Both of us should get out of her way.

21:26.028 --> 21:27.612
No, think about it.

21:29.406 --> 21:30.740
Step back.

21:32.909 --> 21:34.411
Okay.

21:34.494 --> 21:38.123
- Stepping back.
- Stay out of it. Stay safe.

21:42.794 --> 21:44.587
You should get back to your boys.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.308
[doorknob rattling]

21:59.102 --> 22:00.520
[groans softly]

22:11.031 --> 22:12.407
[door creaking]

22:15.035 --> 22:16.036
Mom?

22:16.661 --> 22:18.288
It's time to get going, sweetie.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.958
[Jessica's dad] Hey, vacation awaits.
Rise and shine.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.836
- [Jessica] Dad?
- Come on, already. Time to go.

22:23.918 --> 22:25.545
What are you doing here?

22:25.628 --> 22:27.880
She's not ready. Let's go.

22:27.964 --> 22:30.092
She's just gonna mess up the trip, anyway.

22:30.175 --> 22:32.969
Don't listen to your brother.
It's not true.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.637
Why do you always take her side?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.724
We'd all be alive
if it wasn't for you, Jessie.

22:37.807 --> 22:39.058
[gasps]

22:39.142 --> 22:40.352
[Jessica's mom] Phillip's right.

22:40.435 --> 22:41.853
You really are a screw-up.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.646
Make it right, Jessie.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.190
Make it goddamn right!

22:45.273 --> 22:46.859
[gasps]

22:46.941 --> 22:49.944
[reporter] <i>...live on the scene</i>
<i>to our WHIH field reporter</i>

22:50.027 --> 22:51.070
<i>- for the latest updates...</i>
- Oh, Jesus.

22:51.154 --> 22:54.491
<i>...on this developing and unfolding
hostage standoff.</i>

22:54.574 --> 22:58.286
<i>The father has been holding

23:09.422 --> 23:10.757

23:28.107 --> 23:30.610
Make it goddamn right, Jones.

23:36.199 --> 23:37.743
[Jessica sighs]

23:40.620 --> 23:41.954
What?

23:42.038 --> 23:44.457
Just waiting to see
which Jessica I'm going to get.

23:47.919 --> 23:51.173
When I was a kid,
we used to eat breakfast out here.

23:51.256 --> 23:53.258
Okay, trying-to-make-an-effort Jessica.

23:53.341 --> 23:56.386
More like trying to make
a shit situation tolerable.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.012
I'll take that.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.787
Do your actions ever haunt you?

24:24.372 --> 24:27.375
Before I met you,
I rarely dwelled on anything.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.589
Not even Hope's family?

24:32.672 --> 24:35.217
I mean, how would you feel
if someone forced you to off your parents?

24:35.300 --> 24:37.344
Wouldn't have to force me.

24:40.597 --> 24:43.308
You never talked to me about them.

24:43.391 --> 24:46.436
- Why is that?
- Rather not relive it.

24:46.519 --> 24:51.233
So, killing Hope's parents,
that was really about them?

24:51.316 --> 24:52.984
No, that was all about you.

24:53.067 --> 24:56.153
I was mad at you for literally
throwing me under the bus.

24:56.238 --> 24:58.741
[woman] Jessie Jones.

24:58.823 --> 25:01.075
- Is that you?
- Shit.

25:01.158 --> 25:03.370
- Who is this lovely creature?
- Nosy neighbor.

25:03.453 --> 25:05.121
Let me get her out of here.

25:06.122 --> 25:07.874
Hi, Mrs. De Luca.

25:07.957 --> 25:09.792
[exclaiming]

25:09.876 --> 25:11.294
Jessie!

25:11.378 --> 25:14.046
It's been so long. Ooh!

25:14.130 --> 25:15.757
Look at you.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.217
Such a lovely woman.

25:18.301 --> 25:19.344
[gasps]

25:19.427 --> 25:23.390
And returning home
with such a handsome husband.

25:23.473 --> 25:26.268
- No, we're not married.
- Oh.

25:26.351 --> 25:30.855
I've known Jessie since she was tiny.
Oh, the stories I could tell.

25:30.938 --> 25:32.649
Unfortunately, we don't have the time...

25:32.732 --> 25:36.361
- I'm Elizabeth De Luca. And you are?
- Intrigued.

25:36.444 --> 25:39.071
I would love to hear
all about my little Jessie.

25:39.155 --> 25:42.492
Well, I was there when her parents
brought her home from the hospital.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.618
- Really?
- Yep.

25:43.701 --> 25:48.290
Such a pair of tonsils, that girl!

25:48.373 --> 25:51.501
I mean, I didn't get a lick of sleep
for those first few months.

25:51.584 --> 25:54.546
Well, I hope our caterwauling
hasn't kept you up. Join us.

25:54.629 --> 25:56.339
Oh! [chuckles]

25:58.049 --> 26:02.512
- Oh, bacon. Do you mind?
- Make yourself at home.

26:04.263 --> 26:08.267
So what was Jessie and her family like?
She told me all the surface stuff.

26:08.351 --> 26:09.436
Dad was a mechanic.

26:09.519 --> 26:11.688
Mum was a...
a professor of something or other.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.773
- I'm sure she's busy.
- Yeah, uh...

26:13.856 --> 26:15.983
- Alisa taught math.
- Math.

26:16.067 --> 26:18.403
She was a great teacher,
but a terrible cook.

26:18.486 --> 26:20.322
You know,
when my husband died,

26:20.405 --> 26:23.909
she brought over her...
The absolute worst meatloaf. [laughs]

26:23.991 --> 26:26.703
Must be where you get
your cooking skills from, honey.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.497
[Mrs. De Luca] I loved the Joneses,
but they had their problems.

26:29.581 --> 26:31.207
I remember some nights when

26:31.290 --> 26:34.001
Brian and Alisa would just
fight like cats and dogs.

26:34.085 --> 26:35.252
That's not true.

26:35.878 --> 26:38.673
Oh, honey,
I know that they loved each other,

26:38.756 --> 26:40.383
but everybody's got their troubles.

26:40.467 --> 26:44.596
[Kilgrave] Lord knows that's true.
So what about our girl of the hour?

26:44.679 --> 26:47.432
[chuckling] Oh, she was
the strangest tomboy.

26:47.515 --> 26:50.810
She wore princess dresses with high-tops.

26:50.893 --> 26:53.855
Really? I can't get her to wear a dress
for the life of me.

26:53.938 --> 26:56.398
- I'll wear one to your funeral.
- [laughs]

26:56.483 --> 26:58.193
[Mrs. De Luca] There's that sharp wit.

26:58.275 --> 27:01.654
Oh, I remember this one day.
Oh, I'm sure you remember this, too.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.532
You duct-taped Phillip to a tree.

27:04.616 --> 27:05.908
It was terrible.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.161
You know, I didn't blame her.
I mean, he was such a juvenile delinquent.

27:09.245 --> 27:10.788
No, he wasn't.

27:10.872 --> 27:12.374
He was a great kid.

27:12.457 --> 27:15.001
Oh, yes, of course he was,
but the timing was awful.

27:15.084 --> 27:16.586
I mean, just the very next day,

27:16.669 --> 27:18.588
I mean,
there you were leaving for vacation...

27:18.671 --> 27:20.339
Please stop.

27:25.052 --> 27:27.221
I knew something terrible
was gonna happen.

27:28.681 --> 27:32.685
Not a day goes by that I don't regret
not warning you.

27:32.769 --> 27:38.315
You've no idea what a burden
I've had to live through all these years.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.444
Did you really have a sense that
that terrible accident was gonna happen?

27:42.361 --> 27:43.863
Tell the truth now.

27:46.908 --> 27:49.494
No, I... didn't.

27:49.577 --> 27:52.997
Then why would you say
such a horrible thing?

27:54.123 --> 27:56.418
It makes me feel important.

27:56.501 --> 27:58.461
Isn't that a shitty thing to do?

27:59.587 --> 28:01.297
Say it.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.882
Yes, it is.

28:04.091 --> 28:07.261
[Kilgrave] What would you want to do
to someone who said that to you?

28:09.180 --> 28:11.724
I'd want to slap them.

28:20.316 --> 28:22.276
All right. Leave.

28:32.704 --> 28:34.831
That was just a teensy bit satisfying,
don't you think?

28:35.540 --> 28:36.541
A little.

28:37.459 --> 28:40.294
- You're welcome.
- I told you not to touch me!

28:41.546 --> 28:43.005
For God's sake. [sighing]

28:43.548 --> 28:45.592
Come on, Jessie.

28:45.675 --> 28:46.884
Do not call me that.

28:46.968 --> 28:49.303
We used to do a lot more
than just touch hands.

28:50.722 --> 28:52.014
Yeah.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.933
- It's called rape.
- What?

28:54.476 --> 28:58.896
Which part of staying in five-star hotels,
eating in all the best places,

28:58.980 --> 29:01.065
doing whatever the hell you wanted,
is rape?

29:01.148 --> 29:04.444
The part where I didn't want
to do any of it!

29:05.236 --> 29:07.489
Not only did you physically rape me,

29:07.572 --> 29:11.701
but you violated every cell in my body
and every thought in my goddamn head.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.160
That is not what I was trying to do.

29:13.244 --> 29:15.287
It doesn't matter
what you were trying to do.

29:15.371 --> 29:16.706
You raped me.

29:16.789 --> 29:17.957
- Again and again and again!
- No.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.626
[shouts] How am I supposed to know?

29:19.709 --> 29:23.671
Huh? I never know if someone is doing
what they want or what I tell them to!

29:23.755 --> 29:26.508
- Oh, poor you.
- You have no idea, do you?

29:27.174 --> 29:31.428
I have to painstakingly choose
every word I say.

29:31.513 --> 29:33.180
I once told a man to go screw himself.

29:33.264 --> 29:34.641
Can you even imagine?

29:34.724 --> 29:36.601
Jesus.

29:36.684 --> 29:38.478
I didn't have this.

29:38.561 --> 29:41.731
A home, loving parents, a family.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.526
You blame bad parenting?

29:46.152 --> 29:48.404
My parents died.

29:48.488 --> 29:50.114
You don't see me raping anyone.

29:50.197 --> 29:51.741
- I hate that word.
- Just admit it.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.410
Your parents had nothing to do
with why you forced me...

29:54.494 --> 29:55.495
Do you want to see?

29:55.578 --> 29:57.747
Do you want to see
what they put me through?

30:24.481 --> 30:27.569
Watch this and tell us
which one of us was truly violated.

30:28.653 --> 30:30.446
Welcome to my home.

30:34.241 --> 30:36.660
[man] <i>Put the pieces back together</i>
<i>in the correct pattern.</i>

30:38.621 --> 30:40.498
[woman] <i>Kevin, please.</i>

30:40.582 --> 30:43.500
<i>We need to see
if your fine motor skills have improved.</i>

30:43.585 --> 30:44.877
That's my loving Mum and Dad.

30:44.961 --> 30:47.296
[Kilgrave's dad] <i>Come on, Kevin.</i>
<i>You know what you're supposed to do.</i>

30:47.379 --> 30:50.424
[Kilgrave] Scientists bent on
turning me into a freak.

31:08.275 --> 31:11.153
Neurological exams, fluoroscopy...

31:12.154 --> 31:13.615
brain biopsies.

31:15.157 --> 31:18.828
And my personal favorite,
cerebral spinal fluid extractions.

31:20.121 --> 31:21.330
[Kilgrave's dad] <i>Hold still, son.</i>

31:21.413 --> 31:22.999
<i>- This will only sting a bit.</i>
- [panting]

31:23.082 --> 31:24.792
[Kilgrave's mom] <i>This will all be over</i>
<i>before you know it.</i>

31:24.876 --> 31:26.085
<i>No, Mummy. Please!</i>

31:27.587 --> 31:28.671
[Kilgrave's mom] <i>Don't move.</i>

31:28.755 --> 31:31.466
[screaming]

31:33.760 --> 31:35.845
[Kilgrave] While your dad played with you
on the front lawn,

31:35.928 --> 31:38.931
my dad prepped me
for my fourth elective surgery.

31:39.015 --> 31:40.975
How's that for love?

31:41.058 --> 31:42.727
[continues screaming]

31:45.938 --> 31:47.314
<i>Stop!</i>

31:47.398 --> 31:49.608
[Kilgrave's mom] <i>Kevin, dear,</i>
<i>we're not finished.</i>

31:49.692 --> 31:50.943
[Kilgrave's dad] <i>Calm down.</i>
<i>If you just...</i>

31:51.027 --> 31:52.444
<i>Get away!</i>

31:53.404 --> 31:55.197
[Kilgrave's mom] <i>Albert...</i>

31:55.281 --> 31:57.741
- [stammers] <i>What's happening?</i>
- [Kilgrave's dad] <i>What's going on?</i>

31:57.825 --> 31:59.494
[breathing heavily]

31:59.576 --> 32:00.662
<i>Kevin?</i>

32:02.121 --> 32:03.205
[Kilgrave's mom] <i>Kevin.</i>

32:08.878 --> 32:12.464
Like you,
this power was forced upon me.

32:12.548 --> 32:15.802
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

32:22.433 --> 32:27.229
[reporter 1] <i>According to local PD,</i>
<i>both state and local PD are cooperating.</i>

32:27.313 --> 32:31.943
<i>A hostage negotiator is currently
communicating via bullhorn.</i>

32:32.026 --> 32:35.487
<i>Apparently, all cell phone communication
has been suspended.</i>

32:35.571 --> 32:38.865
[reporter 2] <i>And we can see that here,</i>
<i>in some of the footage, uh...</i>

32:38.950 --> 32:42.662
<i>just right there, you see on the left
side, where the arrow is pointing...</i>

32:42.745 --> 32:44.580
That's what you wanted from Reva.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.251
It was the only evidence left
of how I was made.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.378
[indistinct chatter on TV]

32:52.588 --> 32:56.008
So no one knows you exist,
except your parents,

32:56.092 --> 32:58.010
- if they're still alive.
- [sighing]

32:58.094 --> 33:00.137
Probably. They were young.

33:00.221 --> 33:02.139
They ran away.

33:02.223 --> 33:04.183
From promising careers...
[inhales deeply]

33:04.266 --> 33:06.102
and their ten-year-old son.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.478
You're not ten anymore.

33:07.561 --> 33:09.730
[reporter 2] <i>We do have a neighbor</i>
<i>that has called in,</i>

33:09.814 --> 33:12.692
<i>and we believe that
the husband's first name is Chuck.</i>

33:12.775 --> 33:15.236
<i>That is...
That's brand new information...</i>

33:15.319 --> 33:19.741
All this shit that you do is because
nobody ever taught you how to be good?

33:21.117 --> 33:23.745
I truly hope you're not
laughing at me, Jessica.

33:23.828 --> 33:25.537
No, I'm not.
I'm just thinking.

33:25.621 --> 33:27.914
[reporter 1] <i>...which alerted local PD.</i>

33:27.999 --> 33:30.752
<i>According to sources on the scene,
the father has been holding his wife</i>

33:30.835 --> 33:33.880
<i>and two children at gunpoint
for several hours now.</i>

33:33.963 --> 33:35.339
I think we should go for a ride.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.891
- I assume you have a destination in mind?
- Yep.

33:46.726 --> 33:49.896
- How long will it take?
- I don't know. Two hours.

33:51.939 --> 33:53.315
All right.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.777
Alva? Laurent?

33:55.860 --> 33:57.569
If I'm not back within two hours,

33:57.653 --> 33:59.947
please remove the skin
from each other's faces.

34:06.453 --> 34:07.704
[door closes]

34:09.916 --> 34:11.751
- [sirens wailing]
- [man] Behind the line! Stay back!

34:12.752 --> 34:15.672
[negotiator] Chuck, please pick up
the phone so we can talk.

34:15.755 --> 34:19.592
[Chuck] Go away!
I want to be left alone with my family!

34:19.675 --> 34:23.679
[negotiator] Is anybody hurt?
We heard gunshots. We can help you.

34:23.763 --> 34:25.139
[Chuck] I don't want you here!

34:28.184 --> 34:30.476
Oh, you want me to do the hero thing.

34:30.561 --> 34:32.396
- Yup.
- [chuckles]

34:34.315 --> 34:36.650
Come on, guys, nothing to see.
Step back, all right?

34:36.733 --> 34:38.194
Leave me alone!

34:41.906 --> 34:43.239
Come on.

34:44.867 --> 34:46.911
[Kilgrave] I don't give two shits
about these people.

34:48.495 --> 34:50.831
I don't want to do this.
I don't want the attention it could bring.

34:50.915 --> 34:52.708
Well, you can stay here
or you can be a chicken shit.

34:52.792 --> 34:53.835
Either way, I'm going in.

34:53.918 --> 34:56.712
Stop. You can't come through here.

34:56.795 --> 34:57.964
Well?

34:59.381 --> 35:01.383
Let us through.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.634
Yes, sir.

35:09.391 --> 35:10.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

35:10.893 --> 35:13.020
We can go about our business.
Move along.

35:13.104 --> 35:14.105
Move along.

35:16.607 --> 35:19.568
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?
- But cooler.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.280
Oh, well,
that's that, then.

35:24.824 --> 35:26.158
[exhales]

35:35.251 --> 35:38.045
- [Chuck] Stop your goddamned crying.
- [woman] Then let us go, Chuck.

35:38.129 --> 35:40.256
- I can't take it when you're crying.
- You can do this.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.757
All of you shut up!

35:42.716 --> 35:45.511
Don't shoot.
Don't move, Chuck.

35:45.594 --> 35:47.013
- Can you walk?
- Who are you?

35:47.096 --> 35:49.306
You need to get outside.
The police will help you. Come on.

35:49.390 --> 35:51.600
- You can't just...
- Oh, shut up, Chuck.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.436
Thank you. Thank you.

35:56.063 --> 35:57.899
Don't tell anyone we were here.

35:57.982 --> 35:59.901
[Jessica] Go, now.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.406
Well, now that's out of the way,
put the barrel of the gun into your mouth.

36:06.073 --> 36:08.284
[Jessica] You can't kill him.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.452
No, but he can kill himself.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.578
The man's clearly insane.

36:11.662 --> 36:13.497
He is never gonna be
a productive member of society.

36:13.580 --> 36:15.917
That is not for you to decide.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.710
He will go to prison and feed off
the tit of the taxpayers...

36:18.794 --> 36:21.338
You've never paid
a goddamn tax in your life.

36:23.590 --> 36:24.926
Fair enough. All right.

36:25.009 --> 36:26.678
[clears throat] What would Jessica do?

36:27.386 --> 36:30.806
Make him turn himself over to the police.

36:31.933 --> 36:33.350
[chuckles]

36:34.393 --> 36:36.770
Shotgun's too messy, anyway.

36:36.853 --> 36:40.107
Put the gun down,
turn yourself over to the police.

36:45.279 --> 36:48.740
- [groans]
- And do not tell anyone about us.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.411
- What a waste of energy.
- [scoffs]

36:52.494 --> 36:54.246
Was it?

36:54.330 --> 36:56.373
You just saved four lives.

37:02.879 --> 37:04.548
- [door opens]
- [Alva gasps]

37:04.631 --> 37:06.842
- I want cake!
- [Alva sighs]

37:06.926 --> 37:09.178
Chocolate with strawberries on top.

37:11.055 --> 37:15.726
The look on that woman's face,
the genuine awe and gratitude for me.

37:15.809 --> 37:17.853
Is that why you did
the whole superhero thing?

37:17.937 --> 37:18.938
I don't know.

37:19.021 --> 37:20.356
Or was that about balancing the scales?

37:20.439 --> 37:23.525
All that survivor's guilt
you carry around, because of...

37:24.568 --> 37:26.903
- It doesn't work like that.
- Why not?

37:26.988 --> 37:30.449
You're so outraged
by all the people I've affected.

37:30.532 --> 37:32.368
Do the moral maths.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.829
How many more lives do you think
I'd have to save to get back to zero?

37:36.663 --> 37:40.667
Saving someone doesn't mean
unkilling someone else.

37:42.878 --> 37:44.796
Well, even so,
we should do this more often.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.883
Think of all the people we could help,
all the crimes we could stop.

37:47.967 --> 37:50.636
- We'd be a hell of a dynamic duo.
- You don't need me to do that.

37:50.719 --> 37:52.221
Are you kidding me?

37:52.304 --> 37:54.306
That man almost blew his brains out,

37:54.390 --> 37:56.725
which I genuinely thought
was the right thing to do.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.061
I can't be a hero without you.

38:03.983 --> 38:06.486
Oh, my God.
[sighs]

38:06.568 --> 38:08.237
You're right.

38:08.320 --> 38:12.616
I've got a whole new purpose in life.
It's exciting.

38:12.699 --> 38:13.742
You and me, together,

38:13.825 --> 38:15.411
- we can change the world.
- [breathing heavily]

38:16.578 --> 38:17.913
Hey, what are you doing?

38:18.998 --> 38:21.250
I need to go for a walk alone.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.044
Why?
I thought this was what you wanted?

38:23.127 --> 38:25.546
I need to think.
It's just a walk.

38:28.174 --> 38:29.300
[softly] Well...

38:30.301 --> 38:31.635
I hope so.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.640
I don't think Alva and Laurent
could survive the letdown...

38:37.808 --> 38:40.727
if you didn't come back.

38:40.811 --> 38:44.481
I came here of my own free will.
Trust that I'll come back.

38:46.192 --> 38:48.820
[door opens and closes]

38:51.905 --> 38:53.031
[sighs]

38:55.159 --> 38:56.535
- My turn.
- I'm still playing.

38:56.618 --> 38:59.205
- No, you're not! It's my Game Boy.
- Did you pay for it?

38:59.288 --> 39:01.040
- Let me play!
- Let him play, honey.

39:01.123 --> 39:03.459
- Because he yells the loudest?
- It's not fair, it's mine!

39:03.542 --> 39:06.587
- Let him play.
- [sighs] Fine.

39:08.589 --> 39:11.842
- She broke it! She broke my Game Boy!
- Well, you should've caught it, spaz.

39:11.925 --> 39:13.302
- Jessica, why did you...
- Brian!

39:13.927 --> 39:15.178
[brakes screeching]

39:21.435 --> 39:22.811
[sighs]

39:24.896 --> 39:26.064
[rings doorbell]

39:29.025 --> 39:30.276
[door unlocking]

39:32.738 --> 39:34.240
Uh...

39:34.323 --> 39:35.782
Hi, Trish.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.372
I thought you'd left.

39:43.624 --> 39:44.916
I found Kilgrave, Trish.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.793
I've been living with him
for a couple of days.

39:53.217 --> 39:55.469
- Are you... you?
- Yeah.

39:57.221 --> 40:00.516
- Did you escape? Is he here?
- No, and I left of my own will.

40:01.433 --> 40:05.354
- [exhales] Sit down.
- No, I need to... I need to move.

40:05.437 --> 40:08.023
Sit down.
I'll get you a drink.

40:08.107 --> 40:10.442
[Jessica] I didn't know
you still kept that stuff on hand.

40:11.693 --> 40:13.529
For you.

40:16.698 --> 40:18.284
But, Jess...

40:18.367 --> 40:19.535
living with him?

40:19.618 --> 40:21.745
Living with Kilgrave, what the hell?

40:28.835 --> 40:30.587
Take your time.

40:31.505 --> 40:32.506
[sighs]

40:33.465 --> 40:35.008
He set up a house.

40:36.051 --> 40:37.469
My house.

40:38.554 --> 40:41.640
Trippy psycho-drama bullshit.

40:41.723 --> 40:44.393
Nightmare Barbie's Dreamhouse bullshit.

40:46.353 --> 40:48.063
Oh, my God.

40:48.147 --> 40:50.566
I need to run something by you.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.485
I'm having a
"What would Trish do?" moment.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.573
Actually, I ask myself that a lot.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.659
So here goes.

41:02.077 --> 41:03.662
[Trish clears throat]

41:07.958 --> 41:12.546
What would you do if you could harness
Kilgrave's powers for good?

41:13.672 --> 41:16.592
You can't.
He's a psychopath.

41:16.675 --> 41:20.429
The amount of meds it would require
would be staggering.

41:20.512 --> 41:23.890
But what if you could teach him
to be more like you?

41:23.974 --> 41:28.103
Show him how to use his powers
in a positive way.

41:28.187 --> 41:29.938
How would I do that?

41:31.940 --> 41:33.317
You would have to stay with him,

41:33.400 --> 41:37.404
giving up your life as Trish Walker,
living with him.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.741
- You mean have sex with him.
- No, not that,

41:40.824 --> 41:44.786
but you'd have to be with him
and point him in the right direction.

41:44.870 --> 41:48.457
Would I have any guarantee that
he wouldn't use his abilities on me?

41:48.540 --> 41:49.666
None.

41:51.335 --> 41:55.714
But you could potentially
change the world.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.300
What would you do?

42:02.137 --> 42:03.389
I don't know.

42:03.472 --> 42:05.641
Yes, you do.
You just don't want me to do it.

42:07.934 --> 42:10.729
Obviously,
I'm not the best one for the job,

42:10.812 --> 42:12.273
but I'm the only one.

42:12.356 --> 42:13.940
It can't be all on you, Jess.

42:15.734 --> 42:17.653
But...

42:17.736 --> 42:19.946
But maybe it's a way to,
you know...

42:21.365 --> 42:22.866
make it right.

42:26.787 --> 42:28.455
[laptop chiming]

42:49.976 --> 42:51.770
God damn it!

43:06.868 --> 43:07.911
[Kilgrave] <i>Is she back yet?</i>

43:07.994 --> 43:09.079
No.

43:09.162 --> 43:11.540
Please, please, can we close our eyes now?

43:12.416 --> 43:13.542
Just for a moment.

43:13.625 --> 43:16.545
You can blink when Jones returns
and not a minute before.

43:16.628 --> 43:18.964
- Don't want you missing her.
- [speaking French]

43:19.047 --> 43:20.591
Oh, shut up!

43:21.508 --> 43:23.469
- You think you've got problems?
- [cell phone vibrates]

43:36.732 --> 43:38.317
[cell phone vibrates]

43:56.209 --> 43:57.753
[chuckles softly]

44:01.423 --> 44:03.800
[sighs] She's here!
She's returned!

44:11.558 --> 44:15.145
Clean up this mess.
Wipe your faces.

44:15.228 --> 44:17.272
I'm gonna make myself presentable.

44:30.494 --> 44:31.745
You came back.

44:31.828 --> 44:35.749
I remembered you like Chinese food
as much as you like Italian.

44:36.958 --> 44:38.293
It's got noodles, too.

44:38.377 --> 44:39.836
[Kilgrave] Why did you come back?

44:42.172 --> 44:44.132
You were right.

44:44.215 --> 44:45.384
About what?

44:46.385 --> 44:50.472
Maybe about you and me.
Maybe we can balance the scales a bit.

44:54.184 --> 44:56.061
Well, we should certainly try.

44:57.604 --> 45:00.231
If this hero thing doesn't pan out,
I am out of here.

45:02.526 --> 45:04.194
Laurent! Alva! Dinner's up.

45:06.321 --> 45:07.906
Do they need to eat with us?

45:08.907 --> 45:11.535
First step in heroism,
don't be a prick.

45:15.622 --> 45:17.874
[sighs]

45:19.417 --> 45:20.586
Dig in.

45:24.631 --> 45:26.424
Oh, for Christ's sake.

45:28.343 --> 45:30.596
You can't ingest Sufentanil.

45:38.228 --> 45:39.229
It's not bad.

45:39.855 --> 45:41.690
Jesus, you're such a food snob.

45:41.773 --> 45:42.983
Oh, shit.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.862
Nope, I got it. Sit.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.867
Alva, what's the matter?

45:54.953 --> 45:56.497
[gagging]

45:59.165 --> 46:01.167
This is what Jessica would do.

46:01.251 --> 46:02.794
[groaning]

46:38.622 --> 46:40.206
Shit.

46:50.717 --> 46:51.718
Don't move.

46:51.802 --> 46:53.053
Let him go.

46:53.136 --> 46:55.013
You've seen what he does...

46:55.096 --> 46:57.223
what he can do.
Whatever he's paying you, it's not enough.

46:57.307 --> 46:59.350
You are harming my client.
I can legally shoot you.

46:59.434 --> 47:01.061
- Drop him now.
- [gunshots]

47:06.524 --> 47:08.234
Good job.
Now let me finish him.

47:08.318 --> 47:09.778
I can't.

47:09.861 --> 47:12.530
You've already done the hard part.
Let his death be on me.

47:12.614 --> 47:13.907
You could walk away
and get on with your life.

47:13.990 --> 47:15.366
- [man 1] Stop right there!
- [man 2] Don't move!

47:15.450 --> 47:16.451
There's nowhere to go.

47:16.534 --> 47:19.329
I can't let you kill him. Sorry.

47:19.412 --> 47:21.081
[grunts]

47:22.874 --> 47:24.292
What the hell was that?

47:24.375 --> 47:25.836
Whoa! Did she just fly?

47:25.919 --> 47:27.378
[man 1] That's impossible.

47:28.338 --> 47:29.840
Shit!

47:31.549 --> 47:33.176
[Mrs. De Luca] Excuse me?

47:33.259 --> 47:36.930
Are you Officer Simpson?

47:37.013 --> 47:39.265
Ma'am, you shouldn't be out here.

47:39.349 --> 47:41.727
Uh, Kilgrave asked me to give you this.

47:48.316 --> 47:49.567
- Bomb!
- [beeps]

47:49.651 --> 47:50.819
Run, now!
