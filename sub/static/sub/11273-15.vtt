00:02.240 --> 00:05.596
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.788
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

00:09.960 --> 00:12.997
- What can I do for you, Mr Peterson?
- Elope with my wife.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.195
What do you think, huh?

00:14.360 --> 00:15.509
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, Cliffie.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.557
Pretend we're having
a normal conversation, huh?

00:17.720 --> 00:19.278
With you?

00:20.160 --> 00:22.913
Party. My house. Saturday.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.832
Twelve noon sharp. You're invited.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.514
- A party at noon?
- Keep it under your hat, will you?

00:27.680 --> 00:30.877
You're the only one in the bar I invited.
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.112
- Hurt mine.
- Norm, Norm, Norm.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.636
Look, we're gonna have plenty of beer,
cold cuts galore, a big bucket of slaw.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.597
Oh, you're gonna love it.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.990
And we're gonna maybe
do a little painting.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.674
- Painting?
- Well, just the attic.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.718
That's not the point. I'm inviting a lot
of the guys from the post office.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.950
- lt'll be a great time.
- I don't think so, Clifford.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.680
- Hey, what's the problem here, Norm?
- You know I hate to paint.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.353
- You know that.
- Yeah, so who doesn't?

00:54.520 --> 00:57.592
But, hey, with all these guys
around there, it'll take no time at all.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.275
Oh, all right.
But don't tell Vera, all right?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.954
She'd get upset. I haven't finished
painting our house yet.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.632
Oh, how far have you gotten?

01:04.840 --> 01:06.990
Oh, I bought the little hat.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.880 --> 02:22.237
I am so tired tonight. I can't wait
to get home and take a nice hot bath.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.479
What? Little Miss Popularity
has a free evening?

02:26.640 --> 02:29.996
Don't tell me you've been through
all the men in Boston.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.752
Oh, really, Frasier.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.155
I heard you used to be
a psychiatrist, Dr Crane.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.716
Yes, I once belonged
to that ridiculous profession

02:37.880 --> 02:40.758
where pompous intellectuals get
together and discuss the illusion

02:40.920 --> 02:44.629
that there's something they can do
to alter the human situation

02:44.800 --> 02:49.032
and deny that man is condemned
to a life of bitterness and despair.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.995
Yeah, but you got your weekends off.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.713
I'm sorry, will you excuse me.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.878
Poor Frasier. Lost his job,
and all he's got working for him

03:01.040 --> 03:02.109
is a drinking problem.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.996
Well, you know, we ought to help
Dr Crane. I mean, we're his friends.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.157
Somebody ought to give him
a good talking to.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.436
Don't you think I've done that?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.990
You can't imagine how long
and how hard I've talked.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.998
Oh, yes, we can.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.073
He's lost his self-esteem.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.312
Without that, how can he hope
to practice his profession?

03:25.520 --> 03:28.717
You know what Frasier needs?
He needs to come out of the bullpen

03:28.880 --> 03:32.555
and get his first out. You know,
get his confidence back, his rhythm.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.631
Sam, you're right.
If he could only cure someone.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.394
Do we know someone with a problem?

03:41.440 --> 03:43.749
Yeah, stumper.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.395
Come on, doesn't anyone
want to talk to Frasier?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.869
- I mean, he's a trained psychiatrist.
- Hey, you're the one

03:49.040 --> 03:53.591
who had her brain overhauled. Aren't
you still under warranty or something?

03:54.760 --> 03:59.356
If I talk to him in any personal way,
he'll interpret it as a romantic overture.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.950
Look, we don't even need someone
with a real problem.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.475
One of you could go to him
with some symptoms,

04:04.640 --> 04:07.154
Iet him advise you, wait a while,
then tell him you feel better.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.271
I don't know, Diane.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.994
I think it's a good plan.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.630
- Well, thank you, Woody.
- It's quick, it's simple,

04:15.800 --> 04:19.713
and you don't have to send away
for one of those kits or anything.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.392
What kits?

04:21.560 --> 04:25.189
You know, like the coyote does
in the Road Runner cartoons.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.951
By the way, now, I always wondered,
if he can afford to buy those kits

04:29.120 --> 04:32.795
to catch the Road Runner, why can't
he afford to buy something to eat?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.710
Woody, I think you're missing
the point here.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.714
It's not that Wile E. Coyote
wants to eat, necessarily,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.916
or that he wants to eat a roadrunner.

04:42.080 --> 04:46.278
What he wants is to eat
that particular roadrunner.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.317
It's very existential.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.871
We're trying to save
a man's life here.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.716
Yeah, Cliff, really. Besides, I have
to disagree with you, you know.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.997
You never see the coyote
eat anything else.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.589
Think about it. You never really
see him eat anything at all,

05:00.760 --> 05:03.558
which could be why he's missing
the damn bird all the time, you know.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.029
The brain needs sugar.
Think about it. You gotta clamp...

05:06.200 --> 05:08.156
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But did you guys ever see the one

05:08.320 --> 05:10.834
- where there were two roadrunners?
- Two roadrunners?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.558
- Sam, Sam, Sam.
- What?

05:12.720 --> 05:15.280
I think this plan will work,
and you're the one that has to do it.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.512
Me? Oh, come on. You can't expect
me to pull something over on Frasier.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.193
I don't know anything
about psychology.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.272
But you have no idea how simple this
will be. I'm talking about something

05:23.440 --> 05:25.510
as easy as, say, depression.

05:25.880 --> 05:26.995
- Depression?
- Yes.

05:27.200 --> 05:32.593
The symptoms are loss of appetite,
inability to sleep, loss of sex drive.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.593
Loss of sex drive,
like in not wanting to have any sex?

05:37.760 --> 05:40.479
Forget it. No, no, no. I don't like
to lie about things like that.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.518
Oh, Sam, why not?

05:43.680 --> 05:47.389
Well, when I was a kid, I used to make
goofy faces. My mom used to say,

05:47.800 --> 05:50.234
"Don't do that. It may stay that way."

05:50.400 --> 05:53.358
I'm not doing anything goofy with
my sex life. No, I'm sorry. Come on.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.712
Sam, Sam, Sam. Do this for me,
and I'll owe you a big, big favour

05:57.880 --> 06:01.919
that doesn't involve sex, sex or sex.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.036
- How about sex?
- Or sex.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.838
Hey, Woody, pour me a beer, will you?
Thanks.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.794
Sam, do it for Frasier, your friend.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.632
Now, there's a head I can shrink.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.709
- Say, Frasier.
- Yeah, Sam?

06:19.880 --> 06:24.476
Can I talk to you for a minute in my
office, please? This won't take long.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.555
Look, Sam, I know my bar bill's
way up there,

06:27.760 --> 06:30.877
but I'm gonna be selling off part of my
library, possibly some office furniture.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.759
No, no, no, forget it.
I mean, I want you to pay your bar bill,

06:33.920 --> 06:36.309
but that's not what I want
to talk about.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.119
Frasier, I got a problem.
I'm depressed.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.396
Oh, hey, who isn't?

06:42.040 --> 06:44.759
Oh, well, no, no, no.
This is serious.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.195
I think I need some professional help
on this one.

06:47.360 --> 06:52.480
I can't eat, can't sleep
and I can't have sex.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.037
- Those are the classic symptoms.
- Well, the sex part's not that bad.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.430
I don't even know
why I brought it up.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.911
Well, what do you think
has caused this problem?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.839
The completely nonsexual one?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.310
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
What do you think it is?

07:08.520 --> 07:11.990
You know, you're the only person
I trust to listen to on this one.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.993
Well, okay, Sam,
I think I have some advice for you.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.069
- Oh, good. What?
- Well, get yourself a qualified therapist

07:20.240 --> 07:21.832
to help you get over your depression.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.350
And when you do, give me his name.

07:26.920 --> 07:30.799
No way can a coyote survive
a gunpowder sandwich.

07:32.120 --> 07:36.398
Well, I suppose that proves that
the coyote's the Antichrist. Come on.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.557
Well, I can tell by the look on your face
and Frasier's that it didn't go well.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.752
Not only did it not work,
but I had to tell another man

07:46.920 --> 07:49.070
that my equipment was on the fritz.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.276
It was humiliating.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.437
Well, I really appreciate
that you gave it a try, Sam.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.999
Thank you.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.594
Oh, wait a minute. You still owe me
a favour here, don't you?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.070
Oh, I suppose I do.
Do you have something in mind?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.635
Yeah, let's go to bed.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.950
Sam, have you forgotten my caveats?

08:09.160 --> 08:12.197
Almost. I was hoping
to refresh my memory.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.633
Good morning, one and all.
I feel delicious.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.957
- Well, good morning, Frasier.
- Good morning.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.310
- Coffee. May l, Sam?
- Sure.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.436
- Certainly.
- Listen, Diane, if you wouldn't mind,

08:27.600 --> 08:30.160
I'd like to have a word in private
with Sam.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.674
- Of course. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.111
Sam, I had the most
incredible evening.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.840
Last night I dreamed
about something not Diane.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.390
Well, she was in the background
chattering on about something. Naked.

08:42.559 --> 08:45.836
But the important thing is
I was a therapist again.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.958
And you were my patient,
and we were discussing that problem.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.395
- Problem? What problem?
- You know, the one about your--

08:51.560 --> 08:54.711
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

08:54.880 --> 08:57.269
Why don't we just go into my office
and talk about it there.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.953
- I'm sorry it's so messy.
- All right.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.913
I got home last night, and I couldn't
get your problem out of my mind.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.435
- I think I've got a handle on it.
- Well, great.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.996
Your whole problem stems from the
fact that you're still in love with Diane.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.796
You've been suppressing
that emotion, denying it.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.514
Well, what's your opinion about that?

09:13.680 --> 09:16.035
Let me go find out.
I mean, let me think it out.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.317
I think better out here, more light.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.233
- I hope you're happy.
- Why? What happened?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.834
Frasier thinks I'm depressed
because I'm in love with you.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.508
Oh, dear. I didn't see that coming.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.069
Yeah. I'm gonna go back in there
and tell him the truth

09:30.240 --> 09:32.470
- before this gets even more ridiculous.
- Oh, Sam.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.632
Didn't you see the bounce in that
man's step? The twinkle in his eye?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.950
Let him think he made
a good diagnosis.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.357
What harm could it possibly do?

09:41.520 --> 09:44.318
Oh, I don't know. As long as
you don't think I'm in love with you.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.795
- Well, I don't.
- All right.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.837
Not entirely.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.798
At all.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.791
Much.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.475
Not a bit.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.070
Mostly.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.874
- Okay, you got it.
- Got what?

10:01.080 --> 10:03.594
Oh, come on. We don't have
to rehash this over and over again.

10:03.760 --> 10:08.072
- You said it, and I agree with it.
- But trust me. Sam, say it.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.550
Take a step toward feeling stronger
and better.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.793
Free yourself. Sam, say it now.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.033
Okay. Okay.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.438
- I love Diane.
- Oh, God, it's true.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.792
Thank you, Sam.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.997
You're welcome. Are you all right?

10:42.160 --> 10:45.311
I'm better than all right. I'm reborn.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.233
That revelation was just
the catharsis I needed.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.676
I've looked at the truth in its pure,
undiluted form.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.638
Now I can get on with my life.

10:54.920 --> 10:59.118
Oh, well, great. Hey, I feel better.
You feel better. What could be better?

10:59.280 --> 11:02.317
No, just a second, Sam.
You've only just begun.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.789
- What do you mean?
- You've admitted that you love Diane.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.349
To get rid of your depression,
you'll have to admit it to her.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.317
Sam, you must tell her
that you love her.

11:09.480 --> 11:14.270
Come on, man, don't make me
say that. Don't-- Come on.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.954
- Well, why not?
- Because I don't--

11:17.120 --> 11:20.157
- Because I don't want to.
- Come on, man.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.598
Tell Diane you love her. Let some
fresh air and sunlight in there.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.798
- Frasier?
- What, Sam?

11:26.960 --> 11:29.110
I don't like guys touching my head.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.393
Well, there's our next session.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.951
I'm gonna run over to Louis
and take a look at the new spring line.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.156
See what I can do for
the outer man, eh, Sam?

11:41.320 --> 11:44.312
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.
So this thing with Diane doesn't have

11:44.480 --> 11:46.835
- to take place right away?
- Oh, yes, it does.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.468
Sam, it's very important.
You must tell her immediately.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.831
I'll be back tomorrow, and you can fill
me in on everything that transpires.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.474
Every thought, every nuance,
every detail.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.035
- Every thought?
- Absolutely. Oh, and, Sam,

11:58.200 --> 12:01.795
- this one's on the house.
- Oh, great.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.069
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

12:08.280 --> 12:12.558
- What can I get you, Mr Peterson?
- Clifford Clavin's head.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.553
Well, what are you upset
with Mr Clavin about?

12:15.760 --> 12:18.672
I spent the whole day yesterday
at Cliff's house at a painting party,

12:18.840 --> 12:21.308
and I was the only one
who showed up.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.509
I painted all day while Cliff
and his mother

12:24.680 --> 12:27.956
argued over who forgot to pick up
the food and beer.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.431
Did they at least thank you
for your hard work?

12:30.640 --> 12:32.312
Well, Woody, that depends
if you consider

12:32.480 --> 12:35.597
"your friend sweats like a mule"
a thank you.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.999
No, that's really more
like polite conversation.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.790
Hey, what a party. What a night.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.390
Hey, Norm. Tell me, did I make
an ass out of myself, huh?

12:50.880 --> 12:53.314
I'd bet on it.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.277
Sam, calm down.
There's nothing to be excited about.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.193
Tell Frasier you told me
you loved me.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.713
- Simple as that, huh?
- Certainly.

13:05.920 --> 13:11.199
Well, for your information, he wants
details. Every thought, every moment.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.592
Oh, dear, you're right.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.876
Knowing Frasier,
he'll want a complete account.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.117
- Yeah, right.
- Well, it's still quite simple.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.392
Tell him you said, "Diane, I love you."

13:22.560 --> 13:24.790
I said, "How very sad for you."

13:24.960 --> 13:26.951
- Then you said--
- No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.751
This was your stupid plan.
Now, if I have to be in love with you,

13:31.920 --> 13:34.036
then you have to be in love with me.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.158
- Oh, all right, if it'll help Frasier.
- All right.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.875
So I love you,
and you're gaga over me.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.997
"Gaga" makes it sound like I'm more
in love with you than you are with me.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.037
If we're going to do this,

13:48.200 --> 13:52.478
I want to be only as much in love
with you as you are with me.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.676
Okay, I love you, you love me.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.279
Now...

13:56.760 --> 13:58.591
...the story.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.473
Okay, we went out for Chinese,

14:02.640 --> 14:04.676
told each other you know what,

14:04.840 --> 14:07.912
and then we went back
to my place and tore one off.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.958
- Good lord.
- What?

14:14.160 --> 14:16.435
Well, Frasier knows
I would never be seduced

14:16.600 --> 14:18.113
by such a pedestrian approach.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.392
Hey, who said anything about walking?

14:21.960 --> 14:25.509
Fine. Fine. Let me hear your
suggestion. This ought to be good.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.717
Oh, how about this?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.314
Do you remember that romantic
hideaway in Marblehead?

14:30.520 --> 14:33.193
- The one with the fabulous seafood?
- Yeah.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.552
Tell him we arrived at sunset.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.994
The maitre d'...

14:39.160 --> 14:41.993
- You better write this down.
- Oh, I like this.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.790
All right.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.153
Sunset.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.199
- We asked for our table.
- Yeah, right by the big fireplace.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.716
- With the ocean view.
- Okay.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.394
Now, what did we eat?

14:58.840 --> 15:00.956
He's not going to ask you what we ate.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.828
We were too hungry to eat.
Oh, that's good. That's good.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.833
No, it's not good.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.831
No, no, no. You see,
hungry usually means food.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.436
- Now, what I'm doing here--
- No, I get it.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.596
It's just not good. Erase that.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.196
All right. All right.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.150
Tell him you were
so filled with passion

15:27.320 --> 15:29.595
that you pushed the plates aside
and grabbed my hand.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.315
"Filled with passion."

15:33.520 --> 15:36.876
Then you say what you brought me
up there to tell me.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.191
Oh, yeah, yeah. "l love you."

15:40.960 --> 15:44.396
Well, Sam,
I think you can enhance it a bit.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.399
Like,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.514
"l love you, Diane.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.071
I've always loved you,
and I always will, till the day I die.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.075
No, not even the grave
will diminish my love.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.798
Only...

15:59.960 --> 16:02.952
Only make its flame burn brighter."

16:04.200 --> 16:06.350
Whatever.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.759
- Then, of course, it's my turn.
- Yeah, right. What do you say to me?

16:13.160 --> 16:18.234
I look you in the eyes and I say,
"You're not so bad yourself."

16:18.400 --> 16:23.918
No, no, no. Come on.
After what I just said to you?

16:24.080 --> 16:27.470
No, no, no. It's gotta be more.
Something like,

16:27.640 --> 16:30.313
"l love you so much, I can't stand it.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.953
As far as I'm concerned,

16:32.120 --> 16:35.237
you're the only person
in the world that matters to me,

16:35.400 --> 16:39.791
and I'd jump at the chance
to be your love slave."

16:45.080 --> 16:47.196
Whatever.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.718
All right, all right, all right.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.599
Okay, so then we go upstairs.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.876
If you insist.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.713
We can leave the rest
to Frasier's imagination.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.713
We're already up there, I mean...

17:01.280 --> 17:03.714
I mean, the room is paid for.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.798
All right, all right.
I'll just build a fire.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.515
- If you like.
- Yeah.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.069
Then go over to the bed,

17:13.240 --> 17:18.553
and I'll start nibbling on your ear.
Yeah. You always used to love that.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.438
Oh, yeah.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.869
- What do you mean, "Oh, yeah"?
- Oh, nothing.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.758
No, no, no.
Come on, what do you mean?

17:27.960 --> 17:30.076
Well, I don't suppose it would
do any harm to tell you.

17:30.240 --> 17:34.028
As long as we're on the subject,
I never particularly cared for that.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.550
The ear nibbles?

17:40.920 --> 17:42.399
Well, you sure seemed to.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.309
I didn't want to upset you,
male pride and all that.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.790
What else did you seem to enjoy?

17:51.240 --> 17:53.993
Everything else was fine.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.709
Just the ear nibbles were annoying.

17:59.280 --> 18:03.353
I'm only bringing this up because
there's no longer anything between us,

18:03.520 --> 18:07.229
- and we've grown so.
- Yeah, yeah. Grown.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.994
You know,
while we're on the subject here,

18:10.160 --> 18:13.232
you remember that little
yellow nightie you used to wear?

18:13.440 --> 18:16.079
As I recall, I never wore it very long.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.949
- You loved that nightie.
- No, no, you just thought I loved it.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.997
- You didn't love it?
- It made you look like a big banana.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.792
It's good that we can laugh
like this, right?

18:44.080 --> 18:47.072
I can't believe I paraded around
in that damn nightgown

18:47.240 --> 18:51.995
thinking I was arousing you,
and instead, I was amusing you.

18:52.560 --> 18:57.759
It wasn't amusing that long.
I mean, after a while, it got kind of sad.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.595
Why didn't you tell me?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.309
Well, because I knew
we'd get in a fight,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.118
and you'd end up saying
that you hate me.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.756
- Well, I do hate you, Sam.
- Well, I hate you, Diane.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.395
You're incapable of any originality.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.632
Now, you just said you hate me
because I said I hate you.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.469
All right, fine. I'll change mine.
Yours was "l hate you."

19:24.640 --> 19:26.995
Mine will be "l hate you!"

19:27.160 --> 19:29.276
Oh, great.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.392
And I just bought three ltalian suits.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.313
- Oh, shut up, Frasier!
- Sam, what happened here?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.715
Well, the same thing that
always happens. She's a nut.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.438
She's certifiably insane.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.830
Look, Sam, is that any way to talk
to the woman you love?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.595
Oh, come on, Frasier!
Let me fill you in here, pal.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.990
I don't love Diane.
That was just part of her plan

19:48.160 --> 19:51.994
to make you feel better by making
you think that you'd cured me.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.877
- I see.
- I'm sorry.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.033
Frasier, you were once
a brilliant psychiatrist.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.439
We couldn't bear standing by,
seeing you throw it all away.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.398
So this is what it's come to.

20:07.560 --> 20:11.269
You were practicing deceit
to get my confidence back.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.034
You took pity on me.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.519
You, of all people.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.990
Two of the most pitiful people I know.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.794
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's a lot more pitiful than I am.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.834
- Sam.
- You're both pitiful. I'm pitiful.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.312
We're, all three,
a pitiful ménage à boobs.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.708
Well, this boob is moving on.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.314
You two may not have the courage
to face it, but I finally do.

20:34.520 --> 20:38.035
Sam and Diane, you are now
and have always been, hopelessly in,

20:38.200 --> 20:40.555
I guess the word for it is "love."

20:40.720 --> 20:44.474
And unfortunately for you,
like it or not, you always will be.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.468
I know! I know!
Now you're gonna deny it.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.949
Even though it's ludicrously obvious
to everyone around you,

20:51.120 --> 20:55.511
you two will go on pretending it's not
true because you're emotional infants!

20:55.680 --> 20:57.159
You're in a living hell.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.151
You love each other
and you hate each other.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.072
And you hate yourselves
for loving each other.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.357
Well, my dear friends,
I want no part of it.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.557
It's time I just picked up my life
where I left off.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.792
It's time to put Humpty-Dumpty
back together again.

21:12.280 --> 21:17.912
So I'll get out of here now so you can
just get on with your denial fest.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.596
Well?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.153
Well, what?

22:10.600 --> 22:13.353
What do you think about...

22:13.520 --> 22:15.397
...what Frasier said?

22:17.400 --> 22:19.994
Frasier's a pretty sharp guy.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.799
Well, we agree on something.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.756
What's next?

22:34.720 --> 22:38.235
Well, if this is hell, I'm...

22:39.000 --> 22:41.195
I'm not that unhappy.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.193
Then we agree on something else.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.359
Yeah.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.357
Hey, I only said that...

23:04.520 --> 23:07.990
That I didn't like your nightgown
because you said...

23:08.160 --> 23:10.469
...that you didn't like my ear nibbles.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.313
Well, I would've liked your ear nibbles
if you hadn't sounded

23:13.480 --> 23:15.675
so much like a chipmunk.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.993
Well, I'd rather sound like a chipmunk
than look like a banana.
