WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:05.173
>> CAITLYN: It looks like we'll

00:05.173 --> 00:06.574
have another guest.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.142
Someone I know intimately.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.343
>> CANDIS: Kris.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.911
Really?

00:10.911 --> 00:11.945
>> KATE: Is she being good to

00:11.945 --> 00:13.214
you?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.715
>> CAITLYN: She's been fine.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.417
>> KRIS: I definitely took it

00:16.417 --> 00:17.418
personally.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.419
>> JENNY: She tell you early on?

00:18.419 --> 00:19.420
>> KRIS: No.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.421
>> CAITLYN: I certainly said I

00:20.421 --> 00:21.422
had gender issues and that I was

00:21.422 --> 00:22.756
on hormones.

00:22.756 --> 00:23.824
>> KRIS: I didn't know until all

00:23.824 --> 00:24.825
of this.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.826
I couldn't have given you the

00:25.826 --> 00:26.827
definition of transgender.

00:26.827 --> 00:27.828
>> CAITLYN: Let me finish, let

00:27.828 --> 00:28.829
me finish.

00:28.829 --> 00:29.830
>> KRIS: Until six months ago.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.664
>> CAITLYN: Let me finish.

00:30.664 --> 00:31.665
>> KRIS: Okay, you're being

00:31.665 --> 00:32.666
stubborn, that's fine.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.868
*

00:34.868 --> 00:36.370
>> CAITLYN: There's really a lot

00:36.370 --> 00:38.406
I want to get off my chest with

00:38.406 --> 00:40.674
Kris, and I'm afraid if I don't

00:40.674 --> 00:44.545
have it now, um, I'll probably

00:44.545 --> 00:46.514
never have the conversation.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.151
>> KRIS: Coming!

00:56.790 --> 00:57.791
>> KRIS: Hello.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.792
>> CAITLYN: Uh... you're ready

00:58.792 --> 01:00.128
to go? All packed up?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.129
>> KRIS: Yeah, just packing my

01:01.129 --> 01:02.130
stuff up-- how are you?

01:02.130 --> 01:02.796
>> CAITLYN: Did you have

01:02.796 --> 01:03.797
fun last night?

01:03.797 --> 01:04.565
>> KRIS: Thanks for last night!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.566
Yeah!

01:05.566 --> 01:06.234
>> CAITLYN: Before you go,

01:06.234 --> 01:07.235
you got time?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.236
>> KRIS: I got a little bit of

01:08.236 --> 01:11.272
time.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.274
>> CAITLYN: Um, so, your

01:13.274 --> 01:15.209
impressions of everybody?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.545
>> KRIS: It was really

01:17.545 --> 01:19.313
interesting meeting everybody,

01:19.313 --> 01:20.781
and just, you know, kind of

01:20.781 --> 01:22.883
seeing, like, what kind of group

01:22.883 --> 01:24.552
of girls you have around you.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
I've had my friends my entire

01:26.287 --> 01:27.521
life, some of them.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.522
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I know.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.523
>> KRIS: And you know?

01:29.523 --> 01:30.524
They're everything.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.525
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.560
>> KRIS: And I think one thing

01:32.560 --> 01:33.694
that I was thinking about you

01:33.694 --> 01:35.163
is you never had friends.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.197
>> CAITLYN: No.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.398
>> KRIS: Ever.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.832
And I would get so annoyed with

01:38.832 --> 01:40.368
you when my girlfriends would

01:40.368 --> 01:41.835
come over to the house for a

01:41.835 --> 01:43.003
drink and you would just sit

01:43.003 --> 01:45.173
there, and I would go, "Okay!"

01:45.173 --> 01:46.440
I didn't get it.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.441
>> CAITLYN: Well, 'cause I,

01:47.441 --> 01:48.442
you know, I never...

01:48.442 --> 01:49.443
>> KRIS: And now...

01:49.443 --> 01:50.178
>> CAITLYN: It was always

01:50.178 --> 01:51.179
frustrating to me because I

01:51.179 --> 01:52.813
never, uh, never had felt like I

01:52.813 --> 01:54.448
ever fit in any place until

01:54.448 --> 01:56.550
recently, no, I...

01:56.550 --> 01:57.551
>> KRIS: So, I think that for

01:57.551 --> 01:59.187
you to have girlfriends makes us

01:59.187 --> 02:00.321
really happy.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.622
>> CAITLYN: I've never been more

02:01.622 --> 02:02.723
happy in my life than I have in

02:02.723 --> 02:04.192
the last six months.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.526
>> KRIS: I know that you're

02:05.526 --> 02:07.728
having, like, the greatest time,

02:07.728 --> 02:09.763
but I think that...

02:09.763 --> 02:12.533
you forget that there's also

02:12.533 --> 02:14.368
things, you know, that are

02:14.368 --> 02:16.036
really sad that are going on at

02:16.036 --> 02:17.205
home.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.539
>> CAITLYN: Like what?

02:18.539 --> 02:19.707
>> KRIS: It's just, there's a

02:19.707 --> 02:21.242
lot.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.510
There's just, it's a lot and I

02:22.510 --> 02:24.044
can't...

02:24.044 --> 02:25.213
>> CAITLYN: What's-what's going

02:25.213 --> 02:26.314
on at home that's sad?

02:26.314 --> 02:27.315
>> KRIS: It's, you know,

02:27.315 --> 02:28.382
Lamar's so sick, so sick.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.683
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I know.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.718
>> KRIS: And he's not really

02:30.718 --> 02:31.885
getting better.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.287
And it's really bad.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.288
>> CAITLYN: Here.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.489
>> KRIS: Thanks.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.857
We spent a lot of time there,

02:36.857 --> 02:38.459
and then Khloe got sick, and

02:38.459 --> 02:40.528
then, you know, Kourtney's been

02:40.528 --> 02:42.663
struggling with the whole Scott

02:42.663 --> 02:45.733
thing, and... Kim's... has her

02:45.733 --> 02:49.069
baby situation going on and, you

02:49.069 --> 02:50.804
know, we're worried about trying

02:50.804 --> 02:52.406
to get the baby turned around,

02:52.406 --> 02:53.741
'cause right now he's breech,

02:53.741 --> 02:55.843
and she's got her issues with

02:55.843 --> 02:57.445
her whole uterus.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.447
Kendall got sick, which she had

02:59.447 --> 03:00.681
to go see, like, an infectious

03:00.681 --> 03:02.283
disease doctor.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.951
She caught something in Brazil.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.586
So, you know, it's like,

03:05.586 --> 03:08.689
everybody has a lot going on.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.493
But I know that for you,

03:12.493 --> 03:15.696
sometimes, you check out.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.699
>> CAITLYN: Well, I do.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.134
Um, I-I agree with that.

03:24.438 --> 03:27.708
>> KRIS: You know, you are...

03:29.810 --> 03:32.846
...the greatest person when

03:32.846 --> 03:35.383
you're engaged and you're

03:35.383 --> 03:37.351
present, but when you

03:37.351 --> 03:38.719
disconnect, you're kind of out

03:38.719 --> 03:40.288
of sight, out of mind.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.690
And so, I just didn't want that

03:42.690 --> 03:45.493
to happen to you and the kids.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.762
I don't want to see you check

03:48.762 --> 03:50.298
out.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.799
>> CAITLYN: To be honest with

03:51.799 --> 03:53.166
you, I do.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.202
But, um, I'm a better person

03:55.202 --> 03:57.638
today than I was a year ago.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.006
I've learned a lot about myself.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.574
>> KRIS: Right.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.176
>> CAITLYN: I don't want our 23

04:03.176 --> 04:05.679
years together to be a

04:05.679 --> 04:07.180
"checking out" on it.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.316
>> KRIS: Then that's everything.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.317
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.851
>> KRIS: I just don't want to

04:10.851 --> 04:12.786
see you, um, disconnect from all

04:12.786 --> 04:14.121
the kids.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.356
>> CAITLYN: Well, that's what I

04:15.356 --> 04:17.358
don't want.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.559
>> KRIS: Yeah, I got to tell

04:18.559 --> 04:20.328
you, when Kim brought me some of

04:20.328 --> 04:21.329
your clothes that you were

04:21.329 --> 04:22.330
throwing away...

04:22.330 --> 04:23.331
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.332
I-I saw that.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.599
>> KRIS: I was so sad because I

04:25.599 --> 04:27.601
thought, "Wait a minute, I spent

04:27.601 --> 04:28.802
23 years building this fabulous

04:28.802 --> 04:29.803
wardrobe."

04:29.803 --> 04:31.505
(chuckles): I was...

04:31.505 --> 04:32.906
Who knew I was buying the wrong

04:32.906 --> 04:34.007
(bleep)?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.208
>> CAITLYN: I know that made--

04:35.208 --> 04:36.377
>> KRIS: Oh, my God.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.611
>> CAITLYN: I know.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.946
Um, you know, for the last four

04:38.946 --> 04:41.349
months, five months, I've had

04:41.349 --> 04:42.716
lawyers, and people, and

04:42.716 --> 04:44.251
everything going through name

04:44.251 --> 04:45.986
change, but I finally got my

04:45.986 --> 04:47.455
driver's license.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.889
>> KRIS: Oh, you did?

04:48.889 --> 04:49.890
What does it say-- Caitlyn?

04:49.890 --> 04:50.658
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.659
Caitlyn Marie--

04:51.659 --> 04:52.360
>> KRIS: What's your--?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.361
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn Marie

04:53.361 --> 04:54.027
Jenner.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.028
>> KRIS: Oh, Marie, and it says

04:55.028 --> 04:56.364
that on your driver's license?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.399
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah.

04:58.399 --> 05:01.969
With, uh, gender marker F.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.804
>> KRIS: Wow.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.205
I didn't know they could do

05:05.205 --> 05:06.607
that.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.008
>> CAITLYN: You can go all the

05:08.008 --> 05:09.076
way back to your birth

05:09.076 --> 05:11.044
certificate and change that.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.380
>> KRIS: Stop.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.514
>> CAITLYN: And I did.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.215
>> KRIS: You changed your birth

05:15.215 --> 05:16.950
certificate?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.919
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.021
Passport's in the process.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.456
And it was kind of...

05:22.456 --> 05:23.457
>> KRIS: That's kind of sad,

05:23.457 --> 05:24.458
though.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.859
>> CAITLYN: But I feel like,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.395
I've come out this other side...

05:27.395 --> 05:29.397
>> KRIS: Wait a second, does

05:29.397 --> 05:32.132
this mean that he didn't exist?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.133
>> CAITLYN: No.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.134
>> KRIS: If you changed the

05:34.134 --> 05:35.135
birth certificate?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.136
>> CAITLYN: Well...

05:36.136 --> 05:37.137
>> KRIS: Wait, was I ever

05:37.137 --> 05:38.972
married?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.941
Was I legally married?

05:42.710 --> 05:43.844
>> JENNY: What's gonna happen

05:43.844 --> 05:44.845
here?

05:44.845 --> 05:45.846
>> BARTENDER: I'm gonna give you

05:45.846 --> 05:46.847
a shot, and I'm gonna put my

05:46.847 --> 05:47.848
boobs in your face.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.849
(Jenny babbling)

05:48.849 --> 05:50.418
(women cheering, whooping)

05:50.418 --> 05:51.585
>> SCOTT: I'm just alone with my

05:51.585 --> 05:52.586
thoughts every night and...

05:52.586 --> 05:53.587
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.755
>> SCOTT: It's a very tough

05:54.755 --> 05:55.889
feeling, feeling isolated.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.157
>> CAITLYN: Do you ever see a

05:57.157 --> 05:59.927
reconciliation, you and Kourt?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.995
>> KRIS: Security guards are out

06:01.995 --> 06:03.964
front, and a guy comes

06:03.964 --> 06:05.466
barreling into my office, and

06:05.466 --> 06:06.467
he says, "Can I have a hug and a

06:06.467 --> 06:07.835
kiss?"

06:07.835 --> 06:08.836
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.004
That is so scary.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.441
>> KRIS: Wait, was I ever

06:13.441 --> 06:15.008
married?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.844
Was I legally married?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.812
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.583
>> KRIS (laughs): Oh, my God.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.884
Wow.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.318
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.754
I would like to think of it as

06:26.754 --> 06:29.156
that person still lives inside

06:29.156 --> 06:32.693
me, and that today, I'm

06:32.693 --> 06:36.129
a better person because of it.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.165
And...

06:38.165 --> 06:40.934
I have been fortunate

06:40.934 --> 06:44.037
enough to kind of get rid of all

06:44.037 --> 06:45.238
that bitterness and see a much

06:45.238 --> 06:46.874
softer side of me come out,

06:46.874 --> 06:48.108
which I think...

06:48.108 --> 06:49.109
>> KRIS: It's a good thing.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.210
>> CAITLYN: ...is really

06:50.210 --> 06:51.211
important, you know?

06:51.211 --> 06:52.212
>> KRIS: Yeah.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.213
>> CAITLYN: Um...

06:53.213 --> 06:54.281
>> KRIS: You just don't seem as

06:54.281 --> 06:55.749
angry.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.084
>> CAITLYN: I'm not.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.085
>> KRIS: I think you had a lot

06:58.085 --> 06:59.119
of that going on a little bit.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.120
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I did.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.122
I never was able to

07:02.122 --> 07:03.724
have privacy to be myself.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.725
>> KRIS: Oh.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.726
>> CAITLYN: If you know what I'm

07:05.726 --> 07:06.727
saying?

07:06.727 --> 07:07.728
>> KRIS: Yeah.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.962
>> CAITLYN: I think over the

07:08.962 --> 07:10.363
last couple of years, you were

07:10.363 --> 07:11.832
frustrated with me, I was

07:11.832 --> 07:14.167
frustrated with myself.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.671
And so, um, you know, I just

07:17.671 --> 07:19.172
want to apologize, I think, for

07:19.172 --> 07:20.508
a lot the times, the way I

07:20.508 --> 07:21.975
acted.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.878
Um, it didn't have to be that

07:24.878 --> 07:26.514
way.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.781
I think, going forward from

07:27.781 --> 07:29.149
here...

07:29.149 --> 07:31.184
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.320
>> CAITLYN: ...I would always

07:33.320 --> 07:37.024
want you in my life.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.659
Okay?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.661
>> KRIS: First, I appreciate the

07:40.661 --> 07:43.163
apology-- that's really nice of,

07:43.163 --> 07:45.298
for you to say that.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.434
And I, believe me, I get the "no

07:47.434 --> 07:48.969
privacy" thing.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.203
I don't have any privacy,

07:50.203 --> 07:51.204
either, and Kim and Kanye moved

07:51.204 --> 07:52.205
back in and I've got North

07:52.205 --> 07:54.141
living there and...

07:54.141 --> 07:55.142
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.176
>> KRIS: So I get it.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.578
And if I wanted to do something

07:57.578 --> 07:58.746
that I didn't want anybody else

07:58.746 --> 07:59.780
to know about, it would be very

07:59.780 --> 08:01.381
difficult for me.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.150
I have a hard time finding a

08:03.150 --> 08:04.852
place to, you know, have five

08:04.852 --> 08:06.086
minutes to myself, so I get

08:06.086 --> 08:07.555
that.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.622
And I get how frustrating that

08:08.622 --> 08:10.090
would be.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.592
So, when you put it like that,

08:11.592 --> 08:12.926
that makes sense to me.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.294
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.796
I would hope that our

08:15.796 --> 08:17.430
relationship going forward,

08:17.430 --> 08:19.567
although very different, can be

08:19.567 --> 08:21.969
a really good relationship.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.104
That's my wish.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.238
>> KRIS: And that's everything,

08:25.238 --> 08:26.273
and that's why I'm here, I came

08:26.273 --> 08:27.575
to check up on you.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.709
'Cause I still love you and...

08:28.709 --> 08:29.710
>> CAITLYN: All right.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.478
>> KRIS: ...the kids adore you.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.646
>> CAITLYN: Maybe at some point,

08:32.646 --> 08:35.015
we'll renew our vows.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.584
>> KRIS: What?

08:36.584 --> 08:39.319
(Caitlyn laughs)

08:39.319 --> 08:40.654
>> KRIS: Do I get another

08:40.654 --> 08:41.889
diamond? Right--

08:41.889 --> 08:42.956
>> CAITLYN: I don't want you to

08:42.956 --> 08:44.124
get your hopes up.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.659
(laughs)

08:45.659 --> 08:47.695
I'll need a diamond, too.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.729
>> KRIS: Oh, my God, this is

08:48.729 --> 08:49.730
gonna get very expensive.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.731
>> CAITLYN: It's, it's gonna get

08:50.731 --> 08:51.732
very complicated and very

08:51.732 --> 08:52.733
expensive.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.433
>> KRIS: Yep.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.769
>> CAITLYN: Neither Kris or I

08:55.769 --> 08:57.437
were our best selves in our

08:57.437 --> 08:59.439
relationship at the end.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.174
When you're in a relationship,

09:01.174 --> 09:02.175
there's a lot of things that go

09:02.175 --> 09:03.176
wrong.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.511
And for the things that I was

09:04.511 --> 09:06.847
responsible for, uh, I have no

09:06.847 --> 09:09.182
problem apologizing for those

09:09.182 --> 09:10.183
mistakes.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.519
By the way, I have to admit.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.854
>> KRIS: What?

09:13.854 --> 09:14.855
>> CAITLYN: You know, that

09:14.855 --> 09:17.190
birthday present you got me, um,

09:17.190 --> 09:18.859
that Chanel bag rocks it.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.860
>> KRIS: I know.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.861
>> CAITLYN: Where'd you...?

09:20.861 --> 09:21.862
>> KRIS: That was a good one.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.863
Saks.

09:22.863 --> 09:23.864
>> CAITLYN: Khloe got me a very

09:23.864 --> 09:24.865
nice bag, I told 'em I needed

09:24.865 --> 09:27.200
bags, and I didn't get one golf

09:27.200 --> 09:27.868
shirt.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.869
I didn't get a pair...

09:28.869 --> 09:29.870
>> KRIS: I can get you some for

09:29.870 --> 09:30.537
Christmas.

09:30.537 --> 09:31.538
>> CAITLYN: I didn't... Well,

09:31.538 --> 09:33.206
uh, but the right ones now.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.207
>> KRIS: I know, we never knew

09:34.207 --> 09:35.208
what to get you.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.543
(Caitlyn laughs)

09:36.543 --> 09:38.879
I definitely look at this whole

09:38.879 --> 09:40.547
situation a lot differently

09:40.547 --> 09:41.882
after having spent some time

09:41.882 --> 09:43.550
with these girls, and I

09:43.550 --> 09:46.219
understand a little bit more

09:46.219 --> 09:48.221
about the journey that Caitlyn's

09:48.221 --> 09:49.222
on.

09:49.222 --> 09:52.559
It's a very powerful place that

09:52.559 --> 09:53.560
she's in.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.897
Life is starting to be what I

09:56.897 --> 09:59.900
feel like she's always wanted it

09:59.900 --> 10:01.568
to be, and that makes me happy

10:01.568 --> 10:02.569
too.

10:02.569 --> 10:03.570
All right. Good-bye.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.571
>> CAITLYN: I'll see you later.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.572
Good-bye and have a good flight.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.573
>> KRIS: Thanks for letting

10:06.573 --> 10:07.574
me... in on your party.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.575
>> CAITLYN: Okay, I'm glad you

10:08.575 --> 10:09.576
got to meet everybody.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.577
>> KRIS: Me too.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.912
>> CAITLYN: Till then.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.881
>> KRIS: All right.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.586
>> CANDIS: Yes, I'm ready to

10:19.586 --> 10:20.921
chow down.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.589
I had a couple cocktails last

10:22.589 --> 10:24.257
night with Kris Jenner.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.927
She led me on a dark path.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.261
(Candis sighs)

10:28.261 --> 10:29.596
But she was... she was great.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.599
It was nice to meet her.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.601
You can tell why they have...

10:34.601 --> 10:36.603
still have a little, like, thing

10:36.603 --> 10:37.604
together.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.605
You know what I mean?

10:38.605 --> 10:39.606
>> KATE: They do, they do.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.273
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.274
>> SERVER: Good morning, ladies.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.609
>> KATE: I want johnnycakes.

10:42.609 --> 10:43.944
>> CANDIS: Oh, gosh, my dad used

10:43.944 --> 10:45.278
to make johnnycakes.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.279
>> KATE: Yeah?

10:46.279 --> 10:47.280
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.615
>> KATE: You're big on family,

10:48.615 --> 10:49.616
right?

10:49.616 --> 10:51.284
Would you like to have a family,

10:51.284 --> 10:52.285
maybe kids?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.286
>> CANDIS: Uh, yeah.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.287
>> KATE: You would.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.288
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.289
>> KATE: That's what I want to

10:56.289 --> 10:57.290
see for you.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.291
>> CANDIS: Well, I haven't found

10:58.291 --> 10:59.960
the love that I want to find.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.729
Yet.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.364
I'm at the point now where I

11:04.364 --> 11:06.734
desire to meet someone that I

11:06.734 --> 11:08.368
can actually have a conversation

11:08.368 --> 11:10.370
with, that I have something in

11:10.370 --> 11:13.040
common with, somebody that I can

11:13.040 --> 11:14.742
play Scrabble with.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.744
And also someone that I could

11:16.744 --> 11:18.378
eventually have a family with.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.749
That can bring, you know, bring

11:21.749 --> 11:23.383
that relationship to that next

11:23.383 --> 11:24.384
level.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.385
'Cause I'll just as soon sit in

11:25.385 --> 11:27.387
my house with my dogs and, you

11:27.387 --> 11:28.756
know, garden. (chuckles)

11:28.756 --> 11:30.057
>> KATE: Excuse me, let's go

11:30.057 --> 11:31.058
right there.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.394
Someone who motivates me.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.395
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.396
>> KATE: You've got to be

11:36.396 --> 11:37.397
someone who motivates you, my

11:37.397 --> 11:38.065
baby.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.066
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.067
*

11:40.067 --> 11:41.401
>> KATE: If having family is

11:41.401 --> 11:43.370
something that you want...

11:49.409 --> 11:50.778
>> CANDIS: I think that Kate is

11:50.778 --> 11:51.779
right.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.080
Things don't have to fall in a

11:53.080 --> 11:54.414
certain order to make them

11:54.414 --> 11:55.415
happen.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.084
So, like, if I want a child, why

11:57.084 --> 12:00.821
is it that I have to wait for

12:00.821 --> 12:02.823
the perfect marriage or meeting

12:02.823 --> 12:03.824
the right person?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.158
>> KATE: This is a big step for

12:05.158 --> 12:06.493
anyone.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.828
>> CANDIS: It's huge for me.

12:07.828 --> 12:08.829
>> KATE: Yeah.

12:08.829 --> 12:09.830
>> CANDIS: I have a lot of good

12:09.830 --> 12:11.164
things going on, you know?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.834
I have a career that I love, I

12:13.834 --> 12:15.836
have a family that I love, I'm a

12:15.836 --> 12:18.505
stable, kind of grounded person,

12:18.505 --> 12:19.840
and I think I would make a

12:19.840 --> 12:20.841
really good parent.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.844
And so, um, why should I have

12:23.844 --> 12:25.512
to wait?

12:25.512 --> 12:27.480
>> KATE: Now's your opportunity.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.287
(bell dinging)

12:34.287 --> 12:35.288
>> CAITLYN: We're ready to get

12:35.288 --> 12:36.289
dirty!

12:36.289 --> 12:37.958
Look at those little babies.

12:37.958 --> 12:38.959
This is where they started off,

12:38.959 --> 12:39.960
in the bucket.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.961
>> CANDIS (laughing): Oh, gosh.

12:40.961 --> 12:41.962
>> CAITLYN: And then they worked

12:41.962 --> 12:42.963
to this pot.

12:42.963 --> 12:43.964
>> CANDIS: Oh, look at those

12:43.964 --> 12:44.965
guys.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.299
>> MAN: This'll be a crawfish.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.969
>> JENNY: He's alive, um, but

12:48.969 --> 12:50.303
not for much longer.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.638
I think we should pardon the

12:51.638 --> 12:53.306
crawfish.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.642
We're gonna pardon this guy.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.977
Let him live?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.311
Who wants the crawfish to live?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.646
Raise your hands.

12:59.646 --> 13:03.050
Who wants to eat him?

13:03.050 --> 13:05.018
My friend, Bornstein.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.056
>> COURTNEY: Gosh, so much work

13:09.056 --> 13:10.057
just to eat.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.059
>> CANDIS: Cait, that was a fun

13:12.059 --> 13:13.393
night last night with Kris.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.727
How did you feel about, like,

13:14.727 --> 13:16.063
hanging out with her and...?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.064
>> CAITLYN: After last night, I

13:17.064 --> 13:18.065
had a very nice conversation

13:18.065 --> 13:18.731
with her.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.732
>> CANDIS: Oh, you did?

13:19.732 --> 13:20.733
>> CAITLYN: This morning, before

13:20.733 --> 13:21.401
she left.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.072
You know, I-I apologized for,

13:25.072 --> 13:26.739
you know, over the last three or

13:26.739 --> 13:28.075
four years of our relationship,

13:28.075 --> 13:29.409
you know, wasn't that good, and

13:29.409 --> 13:32.079
I was just as frustrated in the

13:32.079 --> 13:33.746
relationship as she was.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.082
It was just good, you know, let

13:35.082 --> 13:37.084
bygones kind of be bygones, and

13:37.084 --> 13:38.751
I'm glad we got that meeting out

13:38.751 --> 13:39.752
of the way.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.088
>> JENNY: I'm thankful for that.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.089
>> CHANDI: Which is great.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.090
>> CANDIS: So great.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.091
>> CAITLYN: Happy Thanksgiving

13:44.091 --> 13:45.092
to all.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.426
>> CANDIS: Happy Thanksgiving.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.095
>> JENNY: Caitlyn acknowledged

13:48.095 --> 13:50.763
to Kris that she was not

13:50.763 --> 13:52.699
emotionally available during

13:52.699 --> 13:53.700
their marriage.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.702
She took responsibility.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.703
That's kind of a "Hallelujah"

13:56.703 --> 13:57.704
moment.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.705
That's the kind of emotional

13:58.705 --> 14:00.373
growth that her friends have

14:00.373 --> 14:01.441
been rooting for.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.442
My friends!

14:02.442 --> 14:04.111
It's been, uh, it's been, uh, a

14:04.111 --> 14:05.445
great... a great journey, and,

14:05.445 --> 14:06.779
uh, I'm grateful to all of you.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.448
So, uh, this is my little gift

14:08.448 --> 14:11.784
to you.

14:11.784 --> 14:12.785
I'm a little sad.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.454
The road trip's just about over,

14:14.454 --> 14:15.788
and we are going back to Los

14:15.788 --> 14:17.124
Angeles for the Thanksgiving

14:17.124 --> 14:18.125
break.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.792
* So fair you well

14:19.792 --> 14:22.129
My dear old friends

14:22.129 --> 14:24.797
I never might see you more... *

14:24.797 --> 14:27.134
Caitlyn really changed over the

14:27.134 --> 14:28.801
course of this trip.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.804
She took responsibility for some

14:31.804 --> 14:33.473
of her mistakes.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.809
She's becoming a more complex,

14:36.809 --> 14:38.478
open person.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.480
I just hope that the process of

14:40.480 --> 14:41.814
self-discovery doesn't stop once

14:41.814 --> 14:43.150
we're off the bus.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.485
When we get back to L.A., I want

14:45.485 --> 14:48.821
her to continue to become a

14:48.821 --> 14:51.158
better version of who she is.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.826
(whooping)

14:53.826 --> 14:55.162
*

14:55.162 --> 14:56.163
>> WOMAN: You got to do a shot.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.164
>> CANDIS: What's your name?

14:57.164 --> 14:58.165
(Candis laughs)

14:58.165 --> 14:59.166
>> JENNY: What's gonna happen

14:59.166 --> 15:00.167
here?

15:00.167 --> 15:01.234
>> SHOT GIRL: I'm going to give

15:01.234 --> 15:02.235
you and then put my boobs in

15:02.235 --> 15:03.236
your face.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.237
>> JENNY: Okay.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.241
(whooping)

15:08.241 --> 15:10.210
(Jenny imitates motor boat)

15:14.982 --> 15:15.983
>> JENNY: That's what I'm

15:15.983 --> 15:16.984
talking about!

15:16.984 --> 15:18.885
(whoops)

15:22.689 --> 15:23.690
(alarm chirping)

15:23.690 --> 15:24.691
>> SCOTT: What's with all the

15:24.691 --> 15:25.358
beeping?

15:25.358 --> 15:26.359
>> CAITLYN: I think it's the

15:26.359 --> 15:27.027
batteries.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.361
I got to find it.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.362
(chirping)

15:29.362 --> 15:30.363
>> SCOTT: Ooh! This w...

15:30.363 --> 15:31.031
>> CAITLYN: Shh! Shh. Shh.

15:31.031 --> 15:34.034
(chirping)

15:34.034 --> 15:35.368
>> WOMAN: In an independent

15:35.368 --> 15:36.369
adoption, you're gonna have to

15:36.369 --> 15:37.370
disclose that you're

15:37.370 --> 15:38.371
transgender.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.372
>> CANDIS: Ignorance,

15:39.372 --> 15:40.373
transphobia.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.374
I've been living my life this

15:41.374 --> 15:42.709
way for so many years, I don't

15:42.709 --> 15:45.045
even think about it anymore, but

15:45.045 --> 15:47.580
apparently other people do.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.323
>> CAITLYN: We are coming up on

15:56.323 --> 15:57.657
Christmas, baby!

15:57.657 --> 15:58.658
Look what I got!

15:58.658 --> 15:59.659
>> JENNY: It's not just, like, a

15:59.659 --> 16:00.660
little gingerbread... it's,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.062
like, a gingerbread mansion.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.063
>> CAITLYN: Guess who bought it

16:03.063 --> 16:04.064
and sent it over to the house.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.065
>> JENNY: It was not Scott

16:05.065 --> 16:05.732
Disick.

16:05.732 --> 16:06.733
>> CAITLYN: Not Scott Disick,

16:06.733 --> 16:07.400
no.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.401
Kris Jenner.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.070
>> JENNY: Ms. Kris Jenner.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.071
Really cool.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.405
So, Caitlyn, my friend Marci

16:12.405 --> 16:13.740
Bowers is coming in ten.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.408
>> CAITLYN: Actually, I'm very

16:15.408 --> 16:16.409
excited about meeting her.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.410
>> JENNY: Good.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.411
>> CAITLYN: Um, I feel a little

16:18.411 --> 16:19.412
uncomfortable talking about that

16:19.412 --> 16:20.413
issue.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.414
>> JENNY: Dr. Marci Bowers has

16:21.414 --> 16:23.416
been my friend for a dozen

16:23.416 --> 16:27.420
years, and she is a surgeon who

16:27.420 --> 16:29.756
performs SRS, or gender

16:29.756 --> 16:31.424
confirmation surgery.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.425
She's also a trans woman

16:32.425 --> 16:33.093
herself.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.094
Here's what I can tell you about

16:34.094 --> 16:35.428
my own experience with-with

16:35.428 --> 16:36.429
surgery.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.430
One, it was really important for

16:37.430 --> 16:38.431
me.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.101
The sense of, "Oh, I'm finally

16:41.101 --> 16:44.704
whole, I'm finally me."

16:44.704 --> 16:46.706
At-at peace and at rest within

16:46.706 --> 16:48.708
the body that I always wanted.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.078
And I've never regretted having

16:51.078 --> 16:52.712
surgery for one day, not one

16:52.712 --> 16:54.381
hour, never.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.382
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.383
>> JENNY: The results were

16:56.383 --> 16:57.717
remarkable.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.718
I know this is maybe too much

16:58.718 --> 17:00.087
information, but it's-it's

17:00.087 --> 17:01.788
nothing to be ashamed of.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.123
>> CAITLYN: Um, that's something

17:03.123 --> 17:05.125
that, uh, right now, I feel a

17:05.125 --> 17:06.126
little uncomfortable talking

17:06.126 --> 17:08.128
about that issue.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.129
>> JENNY: (sighs) When I've

17:09.129 --> 17:11.464
talked to Caitlyn about dating,

17:11.464 --> 17:12.799
she always says, "Well, I can't

17:12.799 --> 17:15.135
imagine a man being in this

17:15.135 --> 17:17.137
world and the kind of things

17:17.137 --> 17:18.805
that, you know, the tabloids

17:18.805 --> 17:20.140
would say about them."

17:20.140 --> 17:21.141
Or she talks about how her kids

17:21.141 --> 17:22.809
would be hurt.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.810
>> CANDIS: Would it be harder

17:23.810 --> 17:25.812
for you to be dating a man, as

17:25.812 --> 17:27.814
opposed to a woman, on the kids

17:27.814 --> 17:28.815
or vice versa?

17:28.815 --> 17:29.816
>> CAITLYN: I think it might be

17:29.816 --> 17:30.817
a little bit tougher on the

17:30.817 --> 17:33.486
girls if it was, um, a guy.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.821
Yeah, if I was dating some guy,

17:34.821 --> 17:37.824
they would go, "Wow."

17:37.824 --> 17:39.492
>> JENNY: I don't believe it.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.827
I think that's... I think

17:40.827 --> 17:42.762
that's... uh, I think that's an

17:42.762 --> 17:43.763
excuse.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.432
And when it comes to the

17:45.432 --> 17:46.766
surgery, I know she's thinking

17:46.766 --> 17:47.900
about it.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.502
>> KRIS: Do you want to date a

17:49.502 --> 17:51.204
guy or a girl?

17:51.204 --> 17:53.773
>> CAITLYN: If I... If I went

17:53.773 --> 17:55.275
through with my final surgery

17:55.275 --> 17:56.343
and all of that.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.344
>> KRIS: What?

17:57.344 --> 17:58.145
>> CAITLYN: I wouldn't date a

17:58.145 --> 17:58.978
guy with...

17:58.978 --> 18:00.713
>> KRIS: Really?

18:00.713 --> 18:01.614
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.915
Yeah.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.950
>> JENNY: Look, I don't care

18:03.950 --> 18:05.418
whether she dates men, or she

18:05.418 --> 18:06.453
dates women, or whether she

18:06.453 --> 18:07.787
doesn't date anybody.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.023
But she needs to find her truth.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.225
And find the words to express

18:12.225 --> 18:13.360
that truth.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.195
Are you reluctant to learn more

18:15.195 --> 18:16.829
about this?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.798
>> CAITLYN: Um...

18:21.701 --> 18:24.237
Um...

18:24.237 --> 18:26.739
how do I answer that?

18:26.739 --> 18:29.742
Uh... that, to me, is really

18:29.742 --> 18:31.077
uncomfortable.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.078
>> JENNY: I'm gonna ask you a

18:32.078 --> 18:32.879
question, you tell me if this is

18:32.879 --> 18:33.680
too personal.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.615
You had this beautiful face work

18:35.615 --> 18:36.716
done.

18:36.716 --> 18:37.484
>> CAITLYN: Right.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.185
>> JENNY: And when I first

18:38.185 --> 18:39.186
walked through the door last

18:39.186 --> 18:39.952
spring and I saw you, I was

18:39.952 --> 18:41.654
like, "Holy cow, she's a

18:41.654 --> 18:42.855
knockout!"

18:42.855 --> 18:44.691
Um, that was more important to

18:44.691 --> 18:45.692
you...

18:45.692 --> 18:46.659
>> CAITLYN: For me, it was

18:46.659 --> 18:48.428
important, my appearance and my

18:48.428 --> 18:50.096
presentation was important.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.264
And they continue to be, the

18:51.264 --> 18:52.232
clothes, the this, the that.

18:52.232 --> 18:52.965
>> JENNY: Mm-hmm.

18:52.965 --> 18:53.700
>> CAITLYN: I know being a woman

18:53.700 --> 18:55.034
is a lot more than that, and I

18:55.034 --> 18:56.203
know for a lot of people in this

18:56.203 --> 18:57.204
community, that's not that

18:57.204 --> 18:58.205
important.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.539
Just being themselves is

18:59.539 --> 19:00.373
important.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.208
>> JENNY: You know, that's...

19:01.208 --> 19:01.974
and-and actually, what you're

19:01.974 --> 19:04.110
describing is, is certainly not

19:04.110 --> 19:05.612
atypical of people that I know.

19:05.612 --> 19:06.446
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.581
>> JENNY: Um, for me, having SRS

19:08.581 --> 19:10.417
was really important.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.684
>> CAITLYN: More power to you.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.519
>> JENNY: Um, and I know other

19:12.519 --> 19:13.320
people who don't want the

19:13.320 --> 19:14.821
surgery, or any surgery.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.822
And I know other who want it

19:15.822 --> 19:19.091
desperately and can't afford it.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.327
>> CAITLYN: Probably the most

19:20.327 --> 19:22.529
private thing for a transperson

19:22.529 --> 19:23.796
to talk about is, you know,

19:23.796 --> 19:25.232
like, way down there, what's

19:25.232 --> 19:26.466
happening.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.336
But, um, why not, Marci?

19:29.336 --> 19:30.337
She is a transwoman, so of

19:30.337 --> 19:31.704
course I would want to meet her,

19:31.704 --> 19:33.940
I want to hear her story, uh,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.308
but also, she's one of the best

19:35.308 --> 19:36.276
surgeons out there for this type

19:36.276 --> 19:38.010
of surgery.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.145
>> JENNY: Well, anyway, so we'll

19:39.145 --> 19:40.880
talk to Marci and, uh, see what

19:40.880 --> 19:42.048
she has to say.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.082
It's just, um, knowledge is

19:43.082 --> 19:45.051
power.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.362
>> CANDIS: Nice swing.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.463
>> CAITLYN: That's all you got

19:56.463 --> 19:57.564
to say, is "nice swing"?

19:57.564 --> 19:58.498
(Candis laughs)

19:58.498 --> 20:00.300
>> CANDIS: That's a big stick.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.401
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.469
>> CANDIS: That's a lot.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.270
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's told me

20:03.270 --> 20:04.437
that in a long time.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.605
See the red flag?

20:05.605 --> 20:06.573
>> CANDIS: Uh-huh.

20:06.573 --> 20:07.407
>> CAITLYN: That's what we're

20:07.407 --> 20:08.174
trying to get it in.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.278
>> CANDIS: Oh, okay.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.345
>> CAITLYN: See, soon as you...

20:12.345 --> 20:13.079
(Candis laughs)

20:13.079 --> 20:14.481
Soon as you... I knew it.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.882
Soon as you got out here, you

20:15.882 --> 20:16.983
were gonna go "I'm gonna kill

20:16.983 --> 20:18.951
this."

20:22.722 --> 20:23.890
There it goes, right down the

20:23.890 --> 20:25.858
middle.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.159
Isn't that amazing?

20:27.159 --> 20:28.528
What did you think of the whole

20:28.528 --> 20:30.129
trip, did you have fun?

20:30.129 --> 20:32.332
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.334
I was actually doing a lot of

20:34.334 --> 20:36.303
thinking on the trip about the

20:36.303 --> 20:39.839
trajectory of my life as far as

20:39.839 --> 20:41.874
family is concerned, you know?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.843
It's like, you have such a full

20:43.843 --> 20:45.345
life with your kids, and...

20:45.345 --> 20:47.013
Adopting or fostering is so

20:47.013 --> 20:48.915
appealing to me. You know?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.684
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. I get that.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.320
>> CANDIS: Damn it!

20:53.320 --> 20:55.622
>> CAITLYN: Damn.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.723
>> CANDIS: So, I don't really

20:56.723 --> 20:57.624
know what to do.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.258
Is it even possible for, like, a

20:59.258 --> 21:01.060
middle-aged transwo...

21:01.060 --> 21:02.194
(breaks off into laughter)

21:02.194 --> 21:03.195
>> CAITLYN: To adopt?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.331
>> CANDIS: To adopt?

21:04.331 --> 21:04.997
>> CAITLYN: Look into it, find

21:04.997 --> 21:05.932
out, I don't know.

21:05.932 --> 21:06.999
>> CANDIS: I don't know.

21:06.999 --> 21:07.834
>> CAITLYN: Your life would be

21:07.834 --> 21:09.636
really full.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.570
>> CANDIS: I'd like to have the

21:10.570 --> 21:11.704
option.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.772
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.940
Actually, we should look into

21:13.940 --> 21:15.074
that.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.909
First of all, you'd make a great

21:16.909 --> 21:18.645
mother.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.448
For me, family is everything.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.082
So, yeah, I think it's good

21:23.082 --> 21:24.183
that she's, uh, thinking about

21:24.183 --> 21:25.352
this kind of stuff.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.353
I don't want her sitting around,

21:26.353 --> 21:27.654
waiting for Mr. Right.

21:27.654 --> 21:28.655
Maybe it's time for her to do it

21:28.655 --> 21:29.722
on her own.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.057
I'll be by your side every step

21:31.057 --> 21:33.025
of the way.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.931
(birds singing)

21:42.702 --> 21:44.036
The last six months of my life

21:44.036 --> 21:45.972
have been really enlightening

21:45.972 --> 21:47.474
for myself.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.208
But one thing I'm really not

21:49.208 --> 21:50.777
comfortable with is-is talking

21:50.777 --> 21:53.380
about this issue of, you know,

21:53.380 --> 21:55.415
gender confirmation s... uh,

21:55.415 --> 21:58.117
surgery.

21:58.117 --> 22:01.388
But, um, I'm meeting with Marci

22:01.388 --> 22:03.055
Bowers.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.056
She's one of the best surgeons

22:04.056 --> 22:05.425
out there for this type of

22:05.425 --> 22:06.693
surgery.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.461
Jenny s-set this up.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.862
Uh, it's a good thing, I... uh,

22:09.862 --> 22:10.897
she's a transwoman, of course I

22:10.897 --> 22:11.998
would want to meet her.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.402
Uh, but to be honest with you,

22:15.402 --> 22:18.170
I... you know, I'm quite nervous

22:18.170 --> 22:20.139
about this.

22:22.875 --> 22:26.513
(knocking at door)

22:26.513 --> 22:27.847
>> CANDIS: To have a family and

22:27.847 --> 22:29.416
have kids, that's the dream.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.149
>> KRIS: You would make a great

22:30.149 --> 22:30.917
mommy.

22:30.917 --> 22:31.751
You should go for it.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.919
And you don't even have to get

22:32.919 --> 22:34.554
pregnant, you little brat.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.088
(Candis laughs)

22:36.088 --> 22:37.657
>> CANDIS: Trying to go into

22:37.657 --> 22:39.526
motherhood and being rejected by

22:39.526 --> 22:41.093
office buildings and the

22:41.093 --> 22:42.629
government... I don't know if I

22:42.629 --> 22:44.030
can do that, you know what I

22:44.030 --> 22:45.998
mean?

22:47.434 --> 22:49.101
(birds singing)

22:49.101 --> 22:50.102
(knocking at door)

22:50.102 --> 22:53.039
>> CAITLYN: Come on in!

22:53.039 --> 22:54.040
We got a lot to talk about,

22:54.040 --> 22:54.974
let's sit down.

22:54.974 --> 22:55.742
>> JENNY: Well, Caitlyn, I've

22:55.742 --> 22:56.509
wanted you to meet Marci

22:56.509 --> 22:57.209
forever.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.277
She's obviously an expert in the

22:58.277 --> 23:01.247
field of, um, gender

23:01.247 --> 23:02.114
reassignment surgery.

23:02.114 --> 23:02.982
Is that... is that the proper

23:02.982 --> 23:03.783
term?

23:03.783 --> 23:04.617
>> DR. MARCI: The politically

23:04.617 --> 23:07.587
correct term is either "genital

23:07.587 --> 23:09.789
reassignment surgery" or "gender

23:09.789 --> 23:11.658
confirmation surgery."

23:11.658 --> 23:12.492
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.860
Why do you think it is that the

23:13.860 --> 23:16.696
media is fixated on the...

23:16.696 --> 23:18.698
"the surgery?"

23:18.698 --> 23:19.699
>> DR. MARCI: Well, this is what

23:19.699 --> 23:21.000
we... this is what we say when I

23:21.000 --> 23:22.234
speak to audiences around the

23:22.234 --> 23:23.536
w... around the country...

23:23.536 --> 23:24.236
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.104
>> DR. MARCI: When is the last

23:25.104 --> 23:26.372
time you passed a stranger on

23:26.372 --> 23:28.475
the street and knew with 100%

23:28.475 --> 23:30.477
certainty what their genitalia

23:30.477 --> 23:31.478
looked like?

23:31.478 --> 23:33.045
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Right.

23:33.045 --> 23:33.946
>> DR. MARCI: The fact is, you

23:33.946 --> 23:35.047
make assumptions every single

23:35.047 --> 23:36.649
day.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.351
So all I do, in the work I

23:39.351 --> 23:40.987
perform, is we just match up

23:40.987 --> 23:41.654
the-the soul with the body,

23:41.654 --> 23:42.489
basically, uh...

23:42.489 --> 23:43.523
>> CAITLYN: What do you think is

23:43.523 --> 23:44.857
the percentage of-of the

23:44.857 --> 23:45.625
community, of the trans

23:45.625 --> 23:46.726
community that actually goes

23:46.726 --> 23:47.860
through the final surgery?

23:47.860 --> 23:48.561
>> DR. MARCI: Few years ago, I

23:48.561 --> 23:50.797
heard it was only 20%, and I

23:50.797 --> 23:52.131
mean, it's expensive, to be...

23:52.131 --> 23:53.365
and so it's about $25,000 out of

23:53.365 --> 23:54.701
pocket...

23:54.701 --> 23:55.835
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

23:55.835 --> 23:56.536
>> DR. MARCI: ...that somebody

23:56.536 --> 23:57.203
has to pay.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.004
>> JENNY: It's one reason why I

23:58.004 --> 23:59.238
had to wait until I was 40.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.573
Because I just, I just didn't

24:00.573 --> 24:01.508
have...

24:01.508 --> 24:02.274
>> DR. MARCI: It's a lot.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.009
>> JENNY: ...I had been saving,

24:03.009 --> 24:03.776
I'd been saving money my whole

24:03.776 --> 24:04.511
life.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.277
>> DR. MARCI: This surgery, the

24:05.277 --> 24:06.312
male to female surgery...

24:06.312 --> 24:07.079
>> CAITLYN: Right.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.715
>> DR. MARCI: ...is easily as

24:08.715 --> 24:10.249
much art as it is science.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.519
So, in terms of genitalia,

24:12.519 --> 24:13.820
everything that a man has, a

24:13.820 --> 24:15.154
woman has as well.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.223
And so, really, that's the basis

24:17.223 --> 24:18.558
of the surgery, is that

24:18.558 --> 24:19.792
embryologically, there is a

24:19.792 --> 24:22.028
transition from female anatomy

24:22.028 --> 24:23.295
to male anatomy.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.430
And so when you're doing the

24:24.430 --> 24:26.799
reverse, you just simply undo

24:26.799 --> 24:28.267
all of the steps.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.369
>> CAITLYN: Um, your sexual

24:30.369 --> 24:33.172
experience... is it... still

24:33.172 --> 24:35.608
there, is it gonna work?

24:35.608 --> 24:36.943
>> DR. MARCI: The-the vast, vast

24:36.943 --> 24:38.711
majority are able to orgasm.

24:38.711 --> 24:39.879
>> CAITLYN: Oh, okay.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.013
>> DR. MARCI: So, the clitoris,

24:41.013 --> 24:41.948
even though it's reduced in

24:41.948 --> 24:45.151
size from its old glory...

24:45.151 --> 24:46.085
>> CAITLYN: Right, from it's old

24:46.085 --> 24:47.086
glory.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.855
>> DR. MARCI: ...um, is, um, is

24:48.855 --> 24:50.156
still very, very sensitive.

24:50.156 --> 24:50.857
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

24:50.857 --> 24:51.558
>> DR. MARCI: But...

24:51.558 --> 24:52.559
>> CAITLYN: Which is

24:52.559 --> 24:53.560
basically... the clitoris is the

24:53.560 --> 24:54.393
head of the penis?

24:54.393 --> 24:55.261
>> DR. MARCI: That's right.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.328
>> JENNY: Post-surgery...

24:56.328 --> 24:57.063
>> DR. MARCI: Yes.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.330
>> JENNY: ...um, I had to get to

24:58.330 --> 24:59.098
know my-my body over...

24:59.098 --> 24:59.699
>> DR. MARCI: Yes, that's also

24:59.699 --> 25:00.099
true.

25:00.099 --> 25:00.733
>> JENNY: ...in a completely new

25:00.733 --> 25:01.367
way.

25:01.367 --> 25:02.434
>> DR. MARCI: As we say, as...

25:02.434 --> 25:03.803
to make a musical metaphor, we

25:03.803 --> 25:06.372
say it's like

25:06.372 --> 25:08.040
"giving up the-the trombone and

25:08.040 --> 25:09.008
picking up a violin."

25:09.008 --> 25:09.576
(Caitlyn chuckles)

25:09.576 --> 25:10.009
>> JENNY: Ah.

25:10.009 --> 25:10.677
>> DR. MARCI: You know.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.678
You... it's... it's still the

25:11.678 --> 25:13.379
same music, but...

25:13.379 --> 25:14.246
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, but different

25:14.246 --> 25:15.682
instrument.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.983
>> JENNY: What would you say to

25:16.983 --> 25:20.186
someone who is thinking about

25:20.186 --> 25:22.589
surgery, but isn't quite sure?

25:22.589 --> 25:23.389
>> DR. MARCI: That's a great

25:23.389 --> 25:24.256
question, Jenny.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.057
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

25:25.057 --> 25:25.925
>> DR. MARCI: And it's something

25:25.925 --> 25:27.159
that everyone has to wrestle

25:27.159 --> 25:28.961
with individually, of course.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.330
'Cause it-it is personal, and...

25:31.330 --> 25:33.332
and, uh, you know, there are a

25:33.332 --> 25:34.801
lot of people who never end up

25:34.801 --> 25:35.768
having surgery, and yet they're

25:35.768 --> 25:37.469
still, you know, men or women.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.838
>> JENNY: Would surgery help

25:38.838 --> 25:41.273
you?

25:41.273 --> 25:44.611
>> CAITLYN: Um... possibly.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.645
Yeah.

25:45.645 --> 25:46.779
Possibly.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.348
I have no idea what the future

25:49.348 --> 25:51.618
holds, but it is really

25:51.618 --> 25:53.385
interesting to talk about this

25:53.385 --> 25:56.455
issue with a doctor that's

25:56.455 --> 25:58.625
intelligent and obviously has

25:58.625 --> 26:00.359
been doing this for years.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.028
So, yeah, there's a lot of

26:02.028 --> 26:02.895
questions to be answered in my

26:02.895 --> 26:04.864
future.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.642
>> CANDIS: Thanks for coming.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.109
>> CAITLYN: No!

26:17.109 --> 26:18.144
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

26:18.144 --> 26:18.945
It's a little nerve-racking for

26:18.945 --> 26:19.746
me.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.412
>> CAITLYN: Is it really?

26:20.412 --> 26:21.347
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.815
So, I've decided to take the

26:22.815 --> 26:24.717
first steps to see, uh, if I can

26:24.717 --> 26:26.285
get information in this adoption

26:26.285 --> 26:27.486
process.

26:27.486 --> 26:28.254
>> DIANE: Hi, nice to meet you.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.221
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

26:29.221 --> 26:29.889
>> DIANE: Come on in.

26:29.889 --> 26:30.556
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.223
>> CAITLYN: All right!

26:31.223 --> 26:31.991
>> CANDIS: There is this amazing

26:31.991 --> 26:33.459
lawyer, and she works primarily

26:33.459 --> 26:36.028
with the LGBT community.

26:36.028 --> 26:36.863
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for

26:36.863 --> 26:37.697
taking this meeting.

26:37.697 --> 26:38.464
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

26:38.464 --> 26:39.766
I was asking Caitlyn the other

26:39.766 --> 26:41.701
day, "What are my options about

26:41.701 --> 26:43.169
adoption as a trans woman

26:43.169 --> 26:45.772
in my 40s?"

26:45.772 --> 26:46.873
>> DIANE: Okay.

26:46.873 --> 26:47.874
>> CANDIS: So I would love to

26:47.874 --> 26:48.875
know about everything.

26:48.875 --> 26:49.876
>> DIANE: So let's start tal--

26:49.876 --> 26:50.877
There's a number of different

26:50.877 --> 26:51.878
kinds of adoptions in

26:51.878 --> 26:53.179
California.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.947
So, you could do a foster

26:54.947 --> 26:57.049
adopt, where you become a foster

26:57.049 --> 26:58.117
parent.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.118
Another way is doing an

26:59.118 --> 27:00.119
independent adoption, where you

27:00.119 --> 27:01.520
find a birth mother that's

27:01.520 --> 27:02.588
willing to place her child with

27:02.588 --> 27:03.923
you for adoption, and then the

27:03.923 --> 27:05.257
last way, which is, I think, the

27:05.257 --> 27:06.258
hardest, is an international

27:06.258 --> 27:07.259
adoption.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.260
>> CANDIS: Really, it's the

27:08.260 --> 27:09.128
hardest?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.129
>> DIANE: Well, 'cause you're

27:10.129 --> 27:11.130
having to comply with not only

27:11.130 --> 27:12.131
the laws of this country for a

27:12.131 --> 27:13.132
home study, but the laws of

27:13.132 --> 27:14.133
whatever country you choose to

27:14.133 --> 27:15.434
adopt.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.036
Most gays and lesbians who've

27:17.036 --> 27:18.570
adopted from foreign countries

27:18.570 --> 27:19.839
had to do so without being out

27:19.839 --> 27:20.940
of the closet.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.008
>> CANDIS: Wow.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.142
>> DIANE: So, realistically...

27:23.142 --> 27:24.143
>> CAITLYN: Oh, really?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.311
>> DIANE: ...your best bet for

27:25.311 --> 27:26.713
adoption, and your most

27:26.713 --> 27:27.914
realistic, are doing it either

27:27.914 --> 27:28.948
an independent adoption or a

27:28.948 --> 27:30.950
foster adopt.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.184
>> CANDIS: Have you ever worked

27:32.184 --> 27:34.353
with transgendered... people?

27:34.353 --> 27:35.421
>> DIANE: I have, I have not

27:35.421 --> 27:36.723
done an independent adoption

27:36.723 --> 27:38.124
with transgender people.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.491
Difficulty you're gonna have in

27:39.491 --> 27:41.127
an independent adoption is

27:41.127 --> 27:42.261
you're gonna have to disclose

27:42.261 --> 27:43.329
that you're transgender.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.330
You've got to be matched with a

27:44.330 --> 27:45.631
birth mother that says, "I want

27:45.631 --> 27:47.033
my child raised by you."

27:47.033 --> 27:50.602
>> CANDIS: Wow. I'm really nice!

27:50.602 --> 27:52.604
>> DIANE: And there are probably

27:52.604 --> 27:53.906
birth mothers out there who will

27:53.906 --> 27:55.507
do it, but it's gonna take...

27:55.507 --> 27:56.876
>> CANDIS: So it really is...?

27:56.876 --> 27:57.877
>> DIANE: ...probably more

27:57.877 --> 27:59.111
effort than if you were that

27:59.111 --> 28:00.179
40-year-old heterosexual couple.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.380
>> CANDIS: Right.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.448
>> DIANE: You know, with the dog

28:02.448 --> 28:03.783
and the white picket fence.

28:03.783 --> 28:04.951
>> CANDIS: I thought going into

28:04.951 --> 28:06.919
this that the hardest part of it

28:06.919 --> 28:08.620
was going to be doing it, um,

28:08.620 --> 28:11.123
alone, but I'm realizing that,

28:11.123 --> 28:13.292
um, really, the hardest part of

28:13.292 --> 28:16.562
this adoption process is going

28:16.562 --> 28:19.265
to be being a trans woman and

28:19.265 --> 28:20.532
all the hoops that I have to

28:20.532 --> 28:22.769
jump over for that.

28:22.769 --> 28:23.770
>> DIANE: If you have more

28:23.770 --> 28:24.904
questions, let me know.

28:24.904 --> 28:25.905
>> CANDIS: Okay, I will.

28:25.905 --> 28:26.906
>> DIANE: But you know....

28:26.906 --> 28:27.907
there's some challenges, but

28:27.907 --> 28:28.908
there's some opportunities

28:28.908 --> 28:29.909
there, as well.

28:29.909 --> 28:30.910
>> CAITLYN: Thank you

28:30.910 --> 28:31.610
for you time.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.579
>> DIANE: My pleasure.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.352
>> CANDIS: Hi.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.353
>> CAITLYN: Hello!

28:41.353 --> 28:42.354
(Danson barking)

28:42.354 --> 28:43.355
>> CANDIS: Oh, Danson!

28:43.355 --> 28:44.356
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my gosh!

28:44.356 --> 28:45.892
The dogs are going crazy!

28:45.892 --> 28:46.893
You're cooking!

28:46.893 --> 28:47.927
>> CANDIS: I'm cooking!

28:47.927 --> 28:48.961
>> CAITLYN: I love that!

28:48.961 --> 28:50.362
Oh, my God, Chandi is in the

28:50.362 --> 28:51.630
house!

28:51.630 --> 28:52.631
>> CHANDI: Hi, baby!

28:52.631 --> 28:53.632
>> CANDIS: Hi, honey.

28:53.632 --> 28:54.300
>> CHANDI: Ooh, it smells

28:54.300 --> 28:55.067
delicious in here.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.068
>> CAITLYN: Hi, baby.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.069
How are you doing?

28:57.069 --> 28:58.070
>> CHANDI: I am great!

28:58.070 --> 28:59.071
>> CAITLYN: I have so missed

28:59.071 --> 29:00.072
you!

29:00.072 --> 29:00.873
All right, let's get something

29:00.873 --> 29:01.540
to eat-- I'm ready.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.809
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.210
Wow.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.845
So what else has been going on?

29:05.845 --> 29:07.880
>> CANDIS: Well, I went...

29:07.880 --> 29:09.215
>> CHANDI: With Candis Cayne?

29:09.215 --> 29:10.516
>> CANDIS: I went to this

29:10.516 --> 29:11.818
lawyer...

29:11.818 --> 29:13.685
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.021
>> CANDIS: ...about adoptions.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.022
>> CHANDI: So she provided you

29:16.022 --> 29:17.089
with lots of information that

29:17.089 --> 29:18.257
made you feel like it might be

29:18.257 --> 29:20.059
something that you will be

29:20.059 --> 29:21.360
interested in doing?

29:21.360 --> 29:22.528
>> CANDIS: It almost felt more

29:22.528 --> 29:25.564
daunting, because you still have

29:25.564 --> 29:30.036
the birth mother being able to

29:30.036 --> 29:32.138
know that you're trans and be

29:32.138 --> 29:36.175
able to say yes or no to who you

29:36.175 --> 29:39.378
are.

29:39.378 --> 29:43.850
I can handle the idea of not

29:43.850 --> 29:46.218
being with someone...

29:46.218 --> 29:47.419
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.687
>> CANDIS: ...and being rejected

29:48.687 --> 29:50.089
by a guy, you know what I mean?

29:50.089 --> 29:51.357
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.724
>> CANDIS: But I don't think I

29:52.724 --> 29:55.227
can handle trying to go into

29:55.227 --> 29:57.229
motherhood and being rejected by

29:57.229 --> 30:00.032
office buildings, and the

30:00.032 --> 30:02.534
government and, uh, potential

30:02.534 --> 30:03.903
mothers, like, I don't know if I

30:03.903 --> 30:05.004
can do that, you know what I

30:05.004 --> 30:06.973
mean?

30:11.110 --> 30:12.744
>> SCOTT: You're wearing a purse

30:12.744 --> 30:13.745
now, you can't do this.

30:13.745 --> 30:14.746
>> CAITLYN: I'll get the light

30:14.746 --> 30:15.747
end.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.748
>> SCOTT: See, this is why being

30:16.748 --> 30:17.749
a Jew is so much better.

30:17.749 --> 30:18.750
All you got to do is carry a

30:18.750 --> 30:19.751
menorah.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.220
>> CANDIS: For a trans woman to

30:21.220 --> 30:22.855
adopt, you have to disclose that

30:22.855 --> 30:24.156
you're trans.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.157
I'm just a little discouraged.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.158
>> KRIS: It's not easy.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.159
If that's in your heart, you

30:27.159 --> 30:29.528
should just go for it.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.264
>> CANDIS: I don't think I can

30:32.264 --> 30:33.966
handle trying to go into

30:33.966 --> 30:35.701
motherhood and being rejected

30:35.701 --> 30:38.370
by office buildings and the

30:38.370 --> 30:40.772
government and, uh, potential

30:40.772 --> 30:43.009
mothers, like, I don't know if I

30:43.009 --> 30:46.278
can do that.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.714
Me being an undesirable person

30:48.714 --> 30:51.083
to have their kids be adopted to

30:51.083 --> 30:53.085
because I'm trans, it's hard for

30:53.085 --> 30:56.255
me t-to think that way because

30:56.255 --> 30:57.656
I've been living my life this

30:57.656 --> 30:58.958
way for so many years I don't

30:58.958 --> 31:00.859
even think about it anymore.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.262
But apparently, other people do.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.964
It's irritating, because if I

31:04.964 --> 31:06.832
was born female to begin with,

31:06.832 --> 31:08.700
none of this would ever even be

31:08.700 --> 31:10.702
a consideration.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.938
>> CAITLYN: Is it difficult?

31:11.938 --> 31:13.072
Absolutely.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.073
But it's not an excuse not to do

31:14.073 --> 31:15.474
it.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.043
>> CHANDI: You're allowing

31:17.043 --> 31:19.011
yourself to be placed in that

31:19.011 --> 31:21.147
space with the "what ifs."

31:21.147 --> 31:22.748
You're going after something

31:22.748 --> 31:25.517
like being a mom, that is so

31:25.517 --> 31:27.519
important for a little person.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.687
To be able to have that support.

31:28.687 --> 31:29.721
>> CAITLYN: And wouldn't she

31:29.721 --> 31:30.957
make a great mom?

31:30.957 --> 31:31.958
>> CHANDI: A great mom, so I

31:31.958 --> 31:33.025
don't want to hear you being

31:33.025 --> 31:34.793
Negative Nancy, uh, behind this.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.395
If you're gonna look into it,

31:36.395 --> 31:38.965
and go into it, you need to go

31:38.965 --> 31:40.967
into it with an open mind, and

31:40.967 --> 31:43.202
not focus on any of the

31:43.202 --> 31:44.971
obstacles that you're gonna run

31:44.971 --> 31:46.505
into.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.975
>> CANDIS: Ignorance,

31:48.975 --> 31:51.010
transphobia-- a lot of times,

31:51.010 --> 31:52.578
it's not the person that's

31:52.578 --> 31:53.980
wanting to beat you up, it's the

31:53.980 --> 31:56.148
behind the scenes, finding out

31:56.148 --> 31:58.017
who and what you are, and not

31:58.017 --> 31:59.751
allowing you to get the bank

31:59.751 --> 32:01.353
loan, or not allowing you to get

32:01.353 --> 32:03.022
the job, or not allowing you to

32:03.022 --> 32:04.590
adopt the children.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.125
So, it's like, once again,

32:06.125 --> 32:08.127
another thing that I have to

32:08.127 --> 32:10.862
deal with because I'm trans.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.372
>> SCOTT: How the hell are you?

32:20.372 --> 32:21.373
>> CAITLYN: I'm good, let's get

32:21.373 --> 32:22.508
a Christmas tree.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.542
>> SCOTT: Who better than a Jew

32:23.542 --> 32:24.843
to go Christmas shopping with?

32:24.843 --> 32:26.245
>> CAITLYN: I agree.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.613
>> SCOTT: Hand hug!

32:27.613 --> 32:28.847
>> CAITLYN: Hand hug, look out!

32:28.847 --> 32:30.249
>> SCOTT: It's almost Hanukkah!

32:30.249 --> 32:31.283
Coming through, got a package,

32:31.283 --> 32:33.585
people!

32:33.585 --> 32:34.686
Your hands are much softer now.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.687
>> CAITLYN: Well, I just used

32:35.687 --> 32:36.688
lotion.

32:36.688 --> 32:37.689
>> SCOTT: Lot of moisturizer.

32:37.689 --> 32:38.690
>> CAITLYN: See, you need a guy

32:38.690 --> 32:39.691
around to help lift things.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.692
>> SCOTT: You're still strong!

32:40.692 --> 32:41.693
>> CAITLYN: It's just a chick

32:41.693 --> 32:42.694
thing, I know.

32:42.694 --> 32:43.395
>> SCOTT: But you're still

32:43.395 --> 32:44.063
strong, right?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.064
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.065
One thing I've learned on this

32:46.065 --> 32:48.200
trip is sometimes, I have the

32:48.200 --> 32:50.936
ability to kind of check out.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.038
>> SCOTT: I haven't talked to

32:52.038 --> 32:53.039
you all night.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.040
>> COURTNEY: Are you ignoring

32:54.040 --> 32:55.041
him?

32:55.041 --> 32:56.042
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not ignoring

32:56.042 --> 32:57.043
him-- he's over there!

32:57.043 --> 32:58.144
>> SCOTT: I've spent more time

32:58.144 --> 32:59.311
with them than I have with you.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.312
>> CANDIS: Scott!

33:00.312 --> 33:02.148
>> JENNY: I think he's upset.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.715
>> CAITLYN: Life's too short.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.484
I really wanted to, uh, reach

33:05.484 --> 33:06.685
out to Scott 'cause I don't want

33:06.685 --> 33:08.587
him to be alone during the

33:08.587 --> 33:09.688
holidays-- that's the worst

33:09.688 --> 33:10.689
thing that can happen.

33:10.689 --> 33:11.690
>> SCOTT: That's kind of like

33:11.690 --> 33:12.691
what Kris gets, right?

33:12.691 --> 33:13.692
>> CAITLYN: Uh, she gets even

33:13.692 --> 33:14.693
bigger than that.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.694
Anyway, yeah, no, so I got the,

33:15.694 --> 33:17.129
um, invitation to the, uh,

33:17.129 --> 33:18.464
Christmas party.

33:18.464 --> 33:19.465
>> SCOTT: Well, of course.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.466
No? Was that--?

33:20.466 --> 33:21.467
>> CAITLYN: You just don't know.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.468
>> SCOTT: Really?

33:22.468 --> 33:23.469
Well, same with me.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.470
>> CAITLYN: Well, but, uh, yeah,

33:24.470 --> 33:25.471
but how are you doing with the

33:25.471 --> 33:26.472
whole holiday season?

33:26.472 --> 33:27.473
>> SCOTT: Well, I mean, it's a

33:27.473 --> 33:28.474
little tough, I mean, you know,

33:28.474 --> 33:29.741
obviously without having my

33:29.741 --> 33:30.976
parents and anybody on my side

33:30.976 --> 33:32.078
of the family, and not really

33:32.078 --> 33:33.945
knowing if I'm going to spend it

33:33.945 --> 33:36.082
with Kourtney and the kids.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.849
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.850
>> SCOTT: But, it's a little

33:38.850 --> 33:40.119
hard for me, because I don't

33:40.119 --> 33:41.153
want people to, like, take pity

33:41.153 --> 33:42.921
on me, either, and they're just

33:42.921 --> 33:44.456
inviting me because I know,

33:44.456 --> 33:45.524
they know that all my family is

33:45.524 --> 33:47.726
dead.

33:47.726 --> 33:48.827
You know, I just want people to

33:48.827 --> 33:49.828
invite me because they want to,

33:49.828 --> 33:50.829
not because they feel bad for

33:50.829 --> 33:51.830
me.

33:51.830 --> 33:52.831
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

33:52.831 --> 33:53.965
>> SCOTT: So it's hard, in that

33:53.965 --> 33:55.000
way, and I'm obviously not

33:55.000 --> 33:56.302
drinking or doing drugs, so I'm

33:56.302 --> 33:58.304
just alone with my thoughts

33:58.304 --> 34:00.639
every night, and it's tough.

34:00.639 --> 34:01.173
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.209
>> SCOTT: It's a very tough

34:03.209 --> 34:04.476
feeling, feeling isolated.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.945
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.013
>> SCOTT: Well, sometimes, I

34:08.013 --> 34:09.115
just want to like--

34:09.115 --> 34:10.249
>> CAITLYN: Do you ever see a

34:10.249 --> 34:13.519
reconciliation, you and Kourt?

34:13.519 --> 34:15.487
>> KRIS: I called 911.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.822
What's your emergency?

34:16.822 --> 34:17.823
I have an intruder in my house.

34:17.823 --> 34:18.824
What does he look like?

34:18.824 --> 34:19.825
And I'm thinking, "What do you

34:19.825 --> 34:20.826
mean what the (bleep) does he

34:20.826 --> 34:22.794
look like?"

34:24.196 --> 34:25.364
>> SCOTT: I'm just alone with my

34:25.364 --> 34:26.365
thoughts every night, and it's a

34:26.365 --> 34:27.366
very tough feeling, feeling

34:27.366 --> 34:28.367
isolated.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.368
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.369
>> SCOTT: You know, sometimes, I

34:30.369 --> 34:31.370
just want to like--

34:31.370 --> 34:32.371
>> CAITLYN: Do you ever see a-a

34:32.371 --> 34:34.440
reconciliation, you and Kourt?

34:36.575 --> 34:38.444
>> SCOTT: I mean, you know, I, I

34:38.444 --> 34:41.947
think that that would be, like,

34:41.947 --> 34:43.715
the dream.

34:43.715 --> 34:44.883
End of the day, I would love to

34:44.883 --> 34:46.152
see us work everything out and

34:46.152 --> 34:47.153
be in love again, and watch

34:47.153 --> 34:48.520
movies together, and be

34:48.520 --> 34:49.688
intimate and love each other

34:49.688 --> 34:50.956
and be best friends.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.224
But I also don't want to just

34:52.224 --> 34:53.825
rush into something that doesn't

34:53.825 --> 34:54.960
make sense.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.728
>> CAITLYN: I understand that.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.764
Um...

34:58.764 --> 35:00.632
(sighs)

35:00.632 --> 35:01.700
You just got to do the best

35:01.700 --> 35:02.768
you can, get through it, and

35:02.768 --> 35:03.869
look forward to next year, you

35:03.869 --> 35:05.036
know, it's a whole new year.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.071
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.673
>> CAITLYN: And I'm so happy

35:07.673 --> 35:09.040
that you're sober and you're not

35:09.040 --> 35:10.442
doing any drugs and this and

35:10.442 --> 35:11.710
that, 'cause that's... that's

35:11.710 --> 35:12.711
like, by far, the most important

35:12.711 --> 35:13.712
thing.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.746
>> SCOTT: I know.

35:14.746 --> 35:15.481
>> CAITLYN: I'm glad to see

35:15.481 --> 35:16.182
you're doin' well.

35:16.182 --> 35:16.948
>> SCOTT: Yeah, and I'm glad to

35:16.948 --> 35:17.616
see you're doing well.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.284
>> CAITLYN: You know what?

35:18.284 --> 35:18.984
Hey, we'll get through the

35:18.984 --> 35:19.651
holidays.

35:19.651 --> 35:20.452
>> SCOTT: Listen, we're always

35:20.452 --> 35:21.253
going through something.

35:21.253 --> 35:21.953
>> CAITLYN: What we need is a

35:21.953 --> 35:22.688
Christmas tree.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.190
>> SCOTT: Christmas tree it is.

35:24.190 --> 35:24.890
>> CAITLYN: Let's get into the

35:24.890 --> 35:25.991
holiday spirit!

35:25.991 --> 35:26.725
>> SCOTT: Holiday spirit.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.694
>> CAITLYN: Ho! Ho! Ho!

35:34.600 --> 35:35.601
>> SCOTT: Let's grab this big

35:35.601 --> 35:37.303
old tree.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.437
>> CAITLYN: Wait a second, now I

35:38.437 --> 35:39.471
got my coffee here...

35:39.471 --> 35:40.339
>> SCOTT: You... you're wearing

35:40.339 --> 35:41.873
a purse, now, you can't do this.

35:41.873 --> 35:42.874
>> CAITLYN: Well, I'll get the

35:42.874 --> 35:43.742
back... I'll get the light end.

35:43.742 --> 35:44.543
You get that end.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.544
>> SCOTT: Okay.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.712
See, this is why being a Jew is

35:46.712 --> 35:47.646
so much better.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.614
All you gotta do is carry a

35:48.614 --> 35:49.381
menorah.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.048
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

35:50.048 --> 35:50.749
>> SCOTT: It weighs a quarter

35:50.749 --> 35:51.417
of a pound.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.117
>> CAITLYN: All right, set her

35:52.117 --> 35:52.918
down right there.

35:52.918 --> 35:53.719
>> SCOTT: Right here, yeah?

35:53.719 --> 35:55.821
Bravo, bravo, tango, tango, 46A,

35:55.821 --> 35:56.755
we're coming in.

35:56.755 --> 35:57.823
>> CAITLYN: Kris's gingerbread

35:57.823 --> 35:59.225
house came.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.125
(Scott exhales sharply)

36:00.125 --> 36:00.859
>> CAITLYN: Did you get one of

36:00.859 --> 36:01.527
those?

36:01.527 --> 36:02.728
>> SCOTT: No.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.230
But... I think that's more of,

36:04.230 --> 36:05.931
like, a fun thing for girls.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.965
>> CAITLYN: Maybe that's...

36:06.965 --> 36:07.833
maybe that's what...

36:07.833 --> 36:08.600
>> SCOTT: She really, she really

36:08.600 --> 36:09.701
accepts you as a woman now.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.702
>> CAITLYN: Maybe I'm on her

36:10.702 --> 36:11.703
good list.

36:11.703 --> 36:12.771
(alarm chirping)

36:12.771 --> 36:13.439
Better than last year.

36:13.439 --> 36:13.939
>> SCOTT: Hoo!

36:13.939 --> 36:14.606
You ain't kidding!

36:14.606 --> 36:15.541
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.342
(chirping continues)

36:16.342 --> 36:17.108
>> SCOTT: What's with all the

36:17.108 --> 36:17.776
beeping?

36:17.776 --> 36:19.077
>> CAITLYN: Um, I got back from

36:19.077 --> 36:20.145
my trip...

36:20.145 --> 36:21.247
(chirping continues)

36:21.247 --> 36:22.881
... and, um, I think it's the

36:22.881 --> 36:23.815
batteries.

36:23.815 --> 36:24.550
(chirping continues)

36:24.550 --> 36:25.284
>> SCOTT: Oh, my God, does that

36:25.284 --> 36:25.951
not drive you nuts?

36:25.951 --> 36:26.718
>> CAITLYN: But I haven't gone

36:26.718 --> 36:27.386
through the house.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.119
But now I can't shut it off.

36:28.119 --> 36:28.787
(chirping continues)

36:28.787 --> 36:29.521
>> SCOTT: You have to sleep with

36:29.521 --> 36:30.489
that?

36:30.489 --> 36:31.390
>> CAITLYN: Uh, I-I sleep with

36:31.390 --> 36:32.558
this right now, so...

36:32.558 --> 36:33.259
(chirping continues)

36:33.259 --> 36:33.892
>> SCOTT: Oh, my God.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.626
>> CAITLYN: There it goes again.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.361
>> SCOTT: It gets me every time.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.161
All right, let's go take it out

36:36.161 --> 36:36.828
and unplug it until you get

36:36.828 --> 36:37.496
batteries, then.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.163
>> CAITLYN: All right.

36:38.163 --> 36:38.964
>> SCOTT: I don't want a lovely

36:38.964 --> 36:39.965
lady like you, uh, hurting

36:39.965 --> 36:40.632
yourself here.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.533
>> CAITLYN: I know.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.334
(chirping continues)

36:42.334 --> 36:43.602
So, I'm pretty sure, just pull

36:43.602 --> 36:44.636
that little thing out...

36:44.636 --> 36:46.071
(Scott chuckles wryly)

36:46.071 --> 36:46.905
Should've done that a long time

36:46.905 --> 36:47.806
ago.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.540
>> CAITLYN: ...and stick it

36:48.540 --> 36:49.275
in...

36:49.275 --> 36:49.875
(chirping continues)

36:49.875 --> 36:51.009
...pluses and minuses.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.711
Sort of...

36:52.711 --> 36:55.281
>> SCOTT: There we go.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.083
(loud beeping)

36:58.083 --> 36:59.084
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no.

36:59.084 --> 36:59.751
(beeping stops)

36:59.751 --> 37:00.852
>> SCOTT: Damn it.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.354
>> CAITLYN: The hell did you do?

37:02.354 --> 37:03.088
>> SCOTT: No, no, that was just

37:03.088 --> 37:03.989
a check.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.992
Yep, she works.

37:06.992 --> 37:07.859
Just testin', testin' the

37:07.859 --> 37:08.527
waters.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.295
>> CAITLYN: It's not gonna...

37:09.295 --> 37:10.161
Where's the next one?

37:10.161 --> 37:11.162
>> PRODUCER: Do you see any kind

37:11.162 --> 37:12.298
of change in Cait?

37:12.298 --> 37:13.198
>> SCOTT: I see a dramatic

37:13.198 --> 37:14.300
change.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.002
And, not visually, so much, but

37:17.002 --> 37:18.404
really, just emotionally.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.438
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate you

37:19.438 --> 37:20.105
helping me out.

37:20.105 --> 37:21.139
>> SCOTT: Anytime.

37:21.139 --> 37:22.674
I mean, I really believe when

37:22.674 --> 37:24.443
Caitlyn was Bruce, he was really

37:24.443 --> 37:26.077
shut off, and angry, and...

37:26.077 --> 37:28.814
just wasn't happy, and now that

37:28.814 --> 37:30.449
she can be who she really wants

37:30.449 --> 37:31.850
to be, it's a whole different

37:31.850 --> 37:32.918
person, and I feel a real

37:32.918 --> 37:33.885
connection.

37:33.885 --> 37:34.986
(chirping, Scott snickers)

37:34.986 --> 37:35.654
>> CAITLYN: Actually, if you

37:35.654 --> 37:36.322
were taller...

37:36.322 --> 37:37.122
>> SCOTT (laughing): I wouldn't

37:37.122 --> 37:37.789
need this ladder.

37:37.789 --> 37:38.590
I gotta get myself a pair of

37:38.590 --> 37:39.625
heels, I guess.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.726
>> CAITLYN: Here we go.

37:40.726 --> 37:41.660
(chirping continues)

37:41.660 --> 37:42.361
>> SCOTT: Oh!

37:42.361 --> 37:43.329
>> CAITLYN: That was another

37:43.329 --> 37:44.062
one.

37:44.062 --> 37:44.930
We gotta find it.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.332
(chirping continues)

37:46.332 --> 37:47.198
>> SCOTT: I'm huntin' wabbit...

37:47.198 --> 37:50.035
>> CAITLYN: Shh!

37:50.035 --> 37:50.702
(chirping continues)

37:50.702 --> 37:51.370
>> SCOTT: Oh!

37:51.370 --> 37:51.870
>> CAITLYN: Shh!

37:51.870 --> 37:52.538
>> SCOTT: This w...

37:52.538 --> 37:54.340
>> CAITLYN: Shh! Shh!

37:54.340 --> 37:55.006
(chirping continues)

37:55.006 --> 37:55.674
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

37:55.674 --> 37:56.342
>> SCOTT: Insanity.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.008
>> CAITLYN: Which way...

37:57.008 --> 37:57.776
That was far away.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.610
>> SCOTT: I think it's downtown,

37:58.610 --> 37:59.578
Julie Brown.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.379
>> CAITLYN: Bad battery.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.246
(chirping continues)

38:01.246 --> 38:01.980
Bad battery!

38:01.980 --> 38:02.848
>> SCOTT: Making all that noise.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.383
(chirping continues)

38:04.383 --> 38:06.352
(birds singing)

38:09.254 --> 38:11.189
>> KRIS: Hello?

38:11.189 --> 38:12.924
Anybody home?

38:12.924 --> 38:13.859
>> CANDIS: I'm here!

38:13.859 --> 38:15.060
>> KRIS: Hi, Candis!

38:15.060 --> 38:15.727
>> CANDIS: Wow!

38:15.727 --> 38:16.495
>> KRIS: Crazy.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.996
>> CANDIS: You look amazing!

38:17.996 --> 38:20.065
>> KRIS: Who knew? California,

38:20.065 --> 38:21.833
it's, like, 37 degrees outside.

38:21.833 --> 38:22.968
So I got you guys little

38:22.968 --> 38:24.470
Christmas cookies.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.637
Cheers, guys.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.372
>> CANDIS: Here you are. Cheers.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.038
>> CAITLYN: Ho, ho, ho!

38:27.038 --> 38:28.073
Merry Christmas!

38:28.073 --> 38:29.941
Honestly, I think Kris and I are

38:29.941 --> 38:31.142
probably the best place we

38:31.142 --> 38:32.744
possibly could be right now.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.079
She actually sent me an

38:34.079 --> 38:36.615
invitation for Christmas Eve

38:36.615 --> 38:37.649
party, her biggest party of the

38:37.649 --> 38:38.684
year.

38:38.684 --> 38:39.785
So I thought, why not invite

38:39.785 --> 38:40.819
her to my house?

38:40.819 --> 38:41.753
>> KRIS: I brought you that

38:41.753 --> 38:42.854
gingerbread house, and you're

38:42.854 --> 38:44.022
not supposed to leave it in the

38:44.022 --> 38:45.090
Saran...

38:45.090 --> 38:46.224
...you have to, like, embrace

38:46.224 --> 38:48.226
the holidays.

38:48.226 --> 38:49.294
>> CAITLYN: Don't drop it.

38:49.294 --> 38:50.295
>> KRIS: It's okay, I got it.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.930
(Candis laughs)

38:51.930 --> 38:52.831
So, can I tell you guys what

38:52.831 --> 38:53.699
happened to me?

38:53.699 --> 38:54.466
>> CAITLYN: What?

38:54.466 --> 38:55.434
>> KRIS: Today?

38:55.434 --> 38:56.702
>> CAITLYN: Ooh, today, what?

38:56.702 --> 38:57.836
>> KRIS: My heart is beating so

38:57.836 --> 38:58.770
fast.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.038
So, I'm at my house, I was

39:00.038 --> 39:01.039
sitting in my office, on a

39:01.039 --> 39:03.409
business call, my grandson is

39:03.409 --> 39:05.243
sleeping in his crib, security

39:05.243 --> 39:07.012
guards are out front, and a guy

39:07.012 --> 39:09.415
comes barreling into my office

39:09.415 --> 39:11.082
with a backpack.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.017
My home office.

39:12.017 --> 39:12.818
>> CAITLYN: How did he get in

39:12.818 --> 39:13.652
the gates?

39:13.652 --> 39:14.786
>> KRIS: Somebody let him in.

39:14.786 --> 39:17.022
And he says, "Can I have a hug

39:17.022 --> 39:18.824
and a kiss?"

39:18.824 --> 39:19.858
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, that is

39:19.858 --> 39:21.827
so scary.

39:24.496 --> 39:25.564
>> KRIS: Security guards are out

39:25.564 --> 39:27.433
front, and a guy comes barreling

39:27.433 --> 39:28.734
into my office.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.569
And he says, "Can I have a hug

39:30.569 --> 39:31.637
and a kiss?'

39:31.637 --> 39:33.138
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, that is

39:33.138 --> 39:34.640
so scary.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.874
>> KRIS: And I go...

39:35.874 --> 39:37.075
(laughs weakly) "I'm on a call."

39:37.075 --> 39:38.810
And he said, "Oh, okay, well,

39:38.810 --> 39:40.078
I'll come back for the hug, I'll

39:40.078 --> 39:41.012
be right back, I'm gonna pay my

39:41.012 --> 39:42.213
Uber driver."

39:42.213 --> 39:43.515
>> CANDIS: Shut up.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.450
>> KRIS: He walks out the front

39:44.450 --> 39:45.651
door, and I called 911.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.453
"What's your emergency?"

39:47.453 --> 39:48.454
"I have an intruder in my

39:48.454 --> 39:49.087
house."

39:49.087 --> 39:50.055
"What does he look like?"

39:50.055 --> 39:50.822
And I'm thinking, "What do you

39:50.822 --> 39:51.657
mean, what the... does he

39:51.657 --> 39:52.357
look like?

39:52.357 --> 39:53.459
Just get somebody over here!"

39:53.459 --> 39:54.125
(Candis chuckles)

39:54.125 --> 39:54.860
>> CAITLYN: How did the security

39:54.860 --> 39:55.627
guy let him in?

39:55.627 --> 39:56.562
>> KRIS: I don't know.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.295
>> CANDIS: So, he left...?

39:57.295 --> 39:57.963
>> KRIS: The guy?

39:57.963 --> 39:58.630
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.531
>> KRIS: Oh, he's arrested, he's

39:59.531 --> 40:00.198
in jail right now.

40:00.198 --> 40:00.866
>> CANDIS: Oh.

40:00.866 --> 40:01.533
>> KRIS: So, anyway, come to

40:01.533 --> 40:02.468
find out, he walked all over the

40:02.468 --> 40:03.502
house looking for me.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.636
He went into my kitchen, he went

40:04.636 --> 40:05.904
through the family room.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.939
Now, my granddaughter usually

40:07.939 --> 40:09.274
plays in the afternoons in the

40:09.274 --> 40:10.141
family room.

40:10.141 --> 40:10.842
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

40:10.842 --> 40:11.543
>> CAITLYN: That's scary.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.210
>> KRIS: And then, I mean, I

40:12.210 --> 40:12.911
have one, now, I was scared to

40:12.911 --> 40:13.411
death.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.179
Like, we didn't know where he

40:14.179 --> 40:14.846
was.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.547
>> CAITLYN: To be honest with

40:15.547 --> 40:16.247
you, I would walk around the

40:16.247 --> 40:17.649
house, half the people in that

40:17.649 --> 40:19.050
house I didn't even know their

40:19.050 --> 40:20.118
name.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.720
Who the heck they were.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.588
>> KRIS: They were your

40:22.588 --> 40:23.354
children.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.355
(Candis laughs)

40:24.355 --> 40:25.056
>> CAITLYN: Oh, were they?

40:25.056 --> 40:27.092
Were they my children?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.259
>> KRIS: They were your kids.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.194
>> CAITLYN: Oh.

40:29.194 --> 40:29.961
>> KRIS: Yeah.

40:29.961 --> 40:30.629
>> CAITLYN: Ah.

40:30.629 --> 40:31.296
>> KRIS: Yeah.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.030
>> CAITLYN: Let's decorate a

40:32.030 --> 40:32.831
tree.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.299
Ho, ho, ho!

40:34.299 --> 40:35.934
>> CANDIS: Are these, like, all

40:35.934 --> 40:36.968
the kids' stockings?

40:36.968 --> 40:39.304
>> KRIS: Burt, Casey... ooh!

40:39.304 --> 40:40.506
Penelope.

40:40.506 --> 40:42.173
Mason, Bruce... oh, there's no

40:42.173 --> 40:43.241
more Bruce.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.476
>> CAITLYN: He's gone.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.143
>> KRIS: Sorry! He left.

40:45.143 --> 40:45.977
>> CANDIS: I can't even imagine

40:45.977 --> 40:48.480
shopping for Christmas, for a

40:48.480 --> 40:49.515
family the size of yours.

40:49.515 --> 40:50.682
>> KRIS: Oh, you have no idea.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.583
>> CANDIS: That's kind of like,

40:51.583 --> 40:53.118
the... the dream, when you're

40:53.118 --> 40:55.086
growing up, is to have a family,

40:55.086 --> 40:56.421
and have kids and I thought, you

40:56.421 --> 40:58.857
know, I would try to see what

40:58.857 --> 41:00.726
the process would be like for a

41:00.726 --> 41:02.761
transwoman to try to adopt.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.530
So we went and actually met

41:04.530 --> 41:06.832
with this family, uh...

41:06.832 --> 41:07.566
>> CAITLYN: Attorney.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.266
>> CANDIS: ...attorney...

41:08.266 --> 41:09.167
>> CAITLYN: Who was great.

41:09.167 --> 41:09.835
>> CANDIS: ...who was, like,

41:09.835 --> 41:10.536
works with adoption, and

41:10.536 --> 41:11.169
stuff...

41:11.169 --> 41:12.170
>> KRIS: Oh, really? In L.A.?

41:12.170 --> 41:13.071
>> CANDIS: In L.A., yeah.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.540
She said adoption, you have to

41:14.540 --> 41:16.742
disclose that you're trans to

41:16.742 --> 41:19.110
the adoptive parents, and I get

41:19.110 --> 41:20.712
that, you know, but it's just

41:20.712 --> 41:22.447
like another thing that...

41:22.447 --> 41:23.181
>> KRIS: Yeah.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.349
>> CANDIS: ...dealt with.

41:24.349 --> 41:25.617
So, I don't know, I'm just a

41:25.617 --> 41:29.588
little discouraged.

41:29.588 --> 41:30.956
>> KRIS: Well, I don't think, I

41:30.956 --> 41:32.257
mean, I think the whole process

41:32.257 --> 41:33.324
is discouraging.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.359
I mean, the whole thing.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.561
You know...

41:35.561 --> 41:36.562
>> CANDIS: Just the whole thing.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.362
>> KRIS: ...I feel like, I mean,

41:37.362 --> 41:39.130
I've been dealing with Kim for

41:39.130 --> 41:40.899
the last couple years, and her

41:40.899 --> 41:42.768
just... you know, the process

41:42.768 --> 41:44.102
of, like, trying to get

41:44.102 --> 41:46.137
pregnant, and then going through

41:46.137 --> 41:47.372
in vitro, and having all the

41:47.372 --> 41:48.206
issues she had.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.207
>> CANDIS: Right.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.041
>> KRIS: And then, friends of

41:50.041 --> 41:52.310
mine who don't have anybody that

41:52.310 --> 41:54.279
they even date, they can't catch

41:54.279 --> 41:55.647
a break, either.

41:55.647 --> 41:56.715
>> CANDIS: It's not a trans

41:56.715 --> 41:58.016
thing, it's a human thing.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.184
>> KRIS: It's not easy, in any

41:59.184 --> 42:00.919
shape or form.

42:00.919 --> 42:02.654
I think if you're... if that's

42:02.654 --> 42:03.789
in your heart, you should just

42:03.789 --> 42:04.923
go for it.

42:04.923 --> 42:06.457
Because it brings unbelievable

42:06.457 --> 42:09.294
joy.

42:09.294 --> 42:10.929
>> CANDIS: Talking to Kris, it

42:10.929 --> 42:13.231
made me realize that it's not

42:13.231 --> 42:14.733
just a trans problem.

42:14.733 --> 42:17.969
A lot of female, cis women, have

42:17.969 --> 42:19.605
these issues, too.

42:19.605 --> 42:21.907
Sometimes, maybe, life doesn't

42:21.907 --> 42:23.174
turn out the way you think it's

42:23.174 --> 42:25.276
going to, but you're gonna have

42:25.276 --> 42:28.947
to figure out how to move on

42:28.947 --> 42:31.883
and change your expectations and

42:31.883 --> 42:34.085
your trajectory of your life.

42:34.085 --> 42:36.622
I mean, I just feel like I have

42:36.622 --> 42:38.690
so much to give to a little one,

42:38.690 --> 42:39.524
you know?

42:39.524 --> 42:40.291
>> KRIS: Yeah.

42:40.291 --> 42:41.660
You would make a great mommy.

42:41.660 --> 42:42.894
I could see that, though.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.129
You really would.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.731
I think you should go for it.

42:45.731 --> 42:46.998
And you don't even have to get

42:46.998 --> 42:48.199
pregnant, you little brat.

42:48.199 --> 42:49.901
(Candis laughs)

42:49.901 --> 42:51.637
>> KRIS: Oh, that's a good idea.

42:51.637 --> 42:52.838
>> CAITLYN: Ta-da!

42:52.838 --> 42:53.972
Fixed!

42:53.972 --> 42:55.273
It's only in tape, but it's

42:55.273 --> 42:56.374
good!

42:56.374 --> 42:58.343
>> KRIS: I love it.

43:03.682 --> 43:05.016
>> CAITLYN: Off to Mammoth.

43:05.016 --> 43:05.951
(Ella whoops)

43:05.951 --> 43:08.019
(laughing, whooping)

43:08.019 --> 43:08.820
>> CANDIS: No one has ever

43:08.820 --> 43:09.554
challenged Caitlyn Jenner to

43:09.554 --> 43:10.388
anything that she hasn't stepped

43:10.388 --> 43:11.657
up to the plate.

43:11.657 --> 43:13.959
>> ELLA: Kiss.

43:13.959 --> 43:14.960
Oh!

43:14.960 --> 43:16.027
(laughs)

43:16.027 --> 43:17.162
>> CANDIS: "Presidential hopeful

43:17.162 --> 43:19.130
Ted Cruz opposes equality for

43:19.130 --> 43:20.666
transgender people because he

43:20.666 --> 43:22.167
thinks trans kids will molest

43:22.167 --> 43:23.168
his daughters."

43:23.168 --> 43:24.035
>> ELLA: Ugh.

43:24.035 --> 43:24.836
>> JENNY: Republicans.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.805
Your people. They don't like us.

43:26.805 --> 43:27.538
>> CAITLYN: They're not my

43:27.538 --> 43:28.674
people if they're against this

43:28.674 --> 43:30.676
issue.
