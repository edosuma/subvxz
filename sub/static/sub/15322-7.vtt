WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:04.577
What these kids go through
on a day-to-day basis

00:04.671 --> 00:08.835
is bad enough without this --
this madman out there.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.714
And what are they calling him?
The Pied Piper?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.637
It's ridiculous.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.297
Angie Gower came here once.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.216
Are you sure she didn't
come back again?

00:19.269 --> 00:22.432
Well, you're welcome
to search the place.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.018
Check our logs.
She's not here.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.531
Not a lot of boys up there.
Why is that?

00:31.573 --> 00:33.905
Girls like getting
their picture taken.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.532
They're just kids
in so many ways.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.862
Yeah.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.868
They're more vulnerable
than the boys.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.246
But that's probably obvious.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.247
Do you have any photos
of the girls

00:43.293 --> 00:45.705
who passed through here
3, 3 1/2 years ago?

00:45.754 --> 00:48.837
Uh, I might.
Ican look.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.582
You know, any way I can help,
I want to, of course.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.006
What's the attraction?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.387
Excuse me?

00:57.432 --> 01:00.560
To working with kids, I mean.

01:00.561 --> 01:05.851
Nobody misses them...
or goes looking for them.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.435
They're the throwaways
of the world.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.439
That's what
the killer's thinking, too --

01:11.488 --> 01:12.773
easy prey,

01:12.781 --> 01:15.568
fallen angels,
looking to be saved.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.906
I don't think that man out there
is looking to save anyone.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.162
If you have those photos...

01:22.457 --> 01:24.448
Yeah.

01:28.589 --> 01:33.458
I'm sorry I can't offer
more help about Angie.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.426
You know, this house is
a sanctuary for kids like her.

01:36.471 --> 01:40.134
If she does come by,
I'll let you know.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.721
I'm sure we'll be in touch.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.561
Twitch.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.770
Baby.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.856
Where you been?

02:35.906 --> 02:36.861
Out.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.522
We were just, um --

02:38.533 --> 02:41.866
Whatever. I mean, uh,
I don't want to know.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.576
Twitch, come on, please.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.158
Don't make such a big deal
out of it.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.323
Huh?
You need a piece, fine.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.664
You think I don't got ass
all over the city?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.960
I just got done scamming
some rich bitch.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.128
I'm talking old, like 40.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.669
Giving it to her all day
in her fancy condo,

03:00.722 --> 03:02.553
getting fed steak and wine,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.885
said she would take me shopping
and get whatever I want.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.175
Yeah, whatever.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.892
You just been on your knees
like everybody else.

03:07.938 --> 03:08.973
Nah, you're the queer.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.398
Eat me.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.732
Hell, no.
I got standards.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.727
Why are you
always such a jerk?!

03:16.738 --> 03:17.818
Hey, hey.
I hate you!

03:17.864 --> 03:18.819
Get off me, you bitch!

03:18.865 --> 03:20.366
And this is my place!
I hate you!

03:20.409 --> 03:22.491
And I don't want
to live with you!

03:22.536 --> 03:23.321
Okay.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.359
Come on, Lyric.
Let's go.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.450
Ugly-ass bitches,
you get out of here!

03:29.418 --> 03:31.784
There's nothing on ViCAP
or CODIS

03:31.837 --> 03:33.418
for Pastor Mike Sheehan.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.419
He's never even gotten
a parking ticket.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.415
Just 'cause
he didn't get caught

03:37.509 --> 03:39.500
doesn't mean
he ain't a pervert.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.672
Everyone's out looking
for Angie --

03:41.722 --> 03:44.179
must be why this place is tomb.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.716
80% of our dead girls
passed through Beacon Home.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.478
He's looking at these girls,
day in, day out.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.105
It's just too much for him.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.688
So he creates this world
around his hunger.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.693
Beacon Home's a perfect setup.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.151
He gets to look
at his victims all day.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.735
It's lot of work
for access to kids

04:02.784 --> 04:04.285
that aren't hard
to get access to.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.947
It's not about access.

04:05.996 --> 04:10.581
It's about him trying
to save them.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.576
Man of God?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.879
It's a lie.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.874
It's a coward's refuge.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.376
Opiate of the masses.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.545
I thought you liked
opiate of the masses.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.261
Not everyone needs
that N.A./A.A. blah, blah.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.642
You know I been clean
for almost two years now?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.598
Good for you.
That's great.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.558
Not everyone finds
their salvation

04:34.608 --> 04:35.973
in some stank-ass basement

04:35.984 --> 04:38.600
with a bunch
of old booze hounds.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.395
I'm gonna get some sleep.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.281
You should, too.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.866
See you in few hours.

04:49.915 --> 04:50.745
Mm.

05:23.949 --> 05:24.904
Cody?

05:29.287 --> 05:31.027
What are you doing here?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.366
I was waiting for you.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.080
How else was I supposed
to see you?

05:34.125 --> 05:36.502
You don't answer your calls.
I want to talk, Sarah.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.540
I'm really sorry, but I can't
get into it right now, okay?

05:39.631 --> 05:40.996
Let's talk tomorrow.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.791
You haven't been home in three
nights. Where have you been?

05:43.844 --> 05:46.130
Have you been sitting
outside my house?

05:46.137 --> 05:49.925
Why does everything get to be
on your terms? Huh?

05:49.975 --> 05:53.217
You just decide something
out of the blue, and that's it?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.431
All right, you need to go home.

05:58.275 --> 06:03.269
Is this how you were
in that other life of yours?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.528
Is this the way
you treated people?

06:05.574 --> 06:07.906
It's no wonder you don't have
anyone in your life.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.991
You need to understand
something,

06:10.036 --> 06:12.869
because it's the best answer
you're going to get.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.498
I was pretending to be something
that I wasn't with you.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.000
And now it's over.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.673
Let go of me,

06:25.677 --> 06:27.417
because you
really don't want me

06:27.429 --> 06:30.341
to tell you a third time
how things are.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.862
Damn, those pearly whites
Ijust seen?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.196
Didn't even know you had teeth.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.278
I thought fangs, maybe.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.950
Ha, ha, ha.
You funny, Bugs.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.330
Where's your Kmart suit?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.117
Being pressed by Versace
since he fabricated it.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.078
Something just stunk up
the air.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.917
Do you smell it?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.126
It smells like pork.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.874
That ain't a smell, wee one.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.884
That's salary and purpose.

07:09.888 --> 07:13.221
Oh.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.097
Watch yourself.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.970
Come on, let's get out of here.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.724
Oh, these pigs!
How do you do?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.440
Fine.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.730
Come on.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.650
Let's go.
He's -- he's a cop.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.411
That's just bugs.
Got him under my thumb.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.821
Hurry up.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.824
Ooh, "Hurry up."

07:40.877 --> 07:43.664
Bullet's got herself
a little love bunny.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.123
What's her name?

07:45.173 --> 07:47.505
Delilah? Jezebel?

07:47.592 --> 07:48.752
Oh, shut up, asswipe.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.258
It's Lyric.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.418
Lyric.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.010
What are you doing
trolling my crib

07:53.098 --> 07:54.634
this time of night for, anyway?

07:54.683 --> 07:58.517
The guy who runs
the Beacon Home, Pastor Mike --

07:58.561 --> 08:00.597
what's up with him?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.808
Man, don't even.
It's not him.

08:02.857 --> 08:03.846
Not him, what?

08:03.900 --> 08:06.016
What do you mean, what?
He's not the killer.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.436
He's like the only guy in
Seattle who's not a pedophile.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.361
Man, you pulled off
some wizardry.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.530
Your little mama's
full-on magnetized

08:16.579 --> 08:17.705
to your skinny ass.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.072
You know, I had me
a whole stable

08:20.125 --> 08:21.865
when I was a young one.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.658
So if you need
any tips or tricks...

08:23.712 --> 08:25.248
...I'm your man.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.338
You're saying you leave your lady
fulfilled at the end of the night?

08:28.383 --> 08:29.498
Believe that.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.968
You sure I shouldn't be
teaching you

08:34.014 --> 08:35.550
how to holla
at the shorties, punk?

08:35.598 --> 08:38.385
Whatever.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.177
I mean, you can be
as smooth as Velveeta,

08:41.229 --> 08:44.141
but at the end of the day, you
got to take care of your girl.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.603
Protect her, you know?
Keep her safe.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.188
This ain't no kind of crib.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.115
You be safe, Bullet.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.087
Like the music?

09:09.174 --> 09:10.755
You know what that is, Ray?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.670
You still got a job?

09:12.719 --> 09:13.879
Why wouldn't I?

09:13.928 --> 09:17.011
You let the kid die
on your shift.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.763
Wasn't my fault.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.470
How many times you got to tell
yourself that before you believe it?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.510
Just the once.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.816
Running out on your shift.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.568
I'd have to guess family.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.027
Wife and kid doing okay,
Frankie?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.907
Everybody healthy?

09:37.952 --> 09:41.911
Yeah?
Problems with the old lady?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.083
Uh-oh.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.502
Really? The wife?

09:46.544 --> 09:47.533
Hmm?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.920
She stepping out on you?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.796
That's hard, buddy.

09:52.884 --> 09:56.297
Um, so,
when you left your shift

09:56.387 --> 09:58.127
and you left the kid to die,

09:58.181 --> 09:59.921
had you just heard about it,

09:59.933 --> 10:03.266
or did you walk in on your
wife banging some other guy?

10:06.606 --> 10:10.645
You sure you want to die
like this, Ray...

10:10.693 --> 10:12.775
dangling from a rope?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.691
Oh, you don't know
what that sound is?

10:16.741 --> 10:19.904
They're building a gallows
just for you, buddy.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.992
You know that
if the weight's off, Ray,

10:24.040 --> 10:26.622
the length of the rope
is off even an inch,

10:26.668 --> 10:30.081
it makes the difference between
strangling to death slowly

10:30.130 --> 10:31.290
and snapping your neck quick.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.913
Either way, you shit yourself.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.337
Got to die
wearing a diaper, Ray.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.547
Ain't that hell of a way
to check out?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.352
Ray. Ray.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.682
It's still up to you, you know,

10:52.694 --> 10:55.857
in how you go out.

10:55.905 --> 10:59.693
You decide how to exit
this world.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.041
Do not tell me
to calm down!

11:10.420 --> 11:11.409
Look, my daughter is in there!

11:11.421 --> 11:12.706
I came in here calm.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.256
I came in here calm,
and that didn't work,

11:14.257 --> 11:16.088
and you’re, like --
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.590
My daughter is in there.
I found these in her things.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.421
- Look, I'm sorry, you cannot be in --
- Look, bed lottery tickets.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.340
- You can't -- listen, you cannot --
- This is -- Kallie! Do not -- Get off of me!

11:21.389 --> 11:23.095
- Get off of me.
- You cannot be in here. Listen.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.133
- Kallie!
- I-I know Kallie, okay?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.309
She is not here, I promise you.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.610
Would you mind?

11:36.613 --> 11:37.944
Just have a seat.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.938
Look, I'm sorry, I --

11:39.991 --> 11:41.481
It's just she's missing,

11:41.492 --> 11:43.323
and I'm trying to find her,

11:43.369 --> 11:45.906
and I'm trying to figure out
who she was.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.822
I didn't even know she read,
let alone science fiction.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.915
But w-why would she
have to stay here?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.700
Couldn't she go someplace else?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.460
Uh, well, uh,

11:54.505 --> 11:57.121
these kids don't have
a lot of options.

11:57.175 --> 12:02.260
Uh, they sleep under bridges,
in abandoned buildings,

12:02.263 --> 12:05.926
and some of them walk
the streets all night.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.143
Kallie took classes here, too,
sometimes.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.773
Cosmetology was her favorite.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.557
Yeah?

12:16.611 --> 12:19.023
And hairstyling.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.232
Ido hair.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.363
I have this chair at our house,

12:22.367 --> 12:25.109
and she used to play around
on it when she was little.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.574
Yeah, well, I guess that's why.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.001
She's still out there.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.339
Yeah?
God tell you that?

12:42.136 --> 12:45.549
Kallie is a tough girl.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.679
A survivor.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.978
Yeah. She is.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.266
Everyone knows.
Is that it?

13:32.270 --> 13:35.512
That kid died.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.388
We should have had eyes on him.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.560
You should have.

13:41.279 --> 13:45.192
You got no idea
what I was dealing with.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.449
Whatever.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.782
My son called me,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.573
said his mother was missing,

13:54.584 --> 13:56.791
and she'd been gone for hours.

14:00.715 --> 14:04.299
She was at a bar
with some guy --

14:04.344 --> 14:06.426
not the first time.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.555
And my boy's looking at me
like I'm some chump.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.386
Everybody knows.

14:16.397 --> 14:20.982
Everybody knows,
even the damn cons.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.022
I got to get to post.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.820
We scoured
every scabies-ridden motel,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.908
S.R.O., and warehouse
in the city.

14:34.957 --> 14:39.246
No luck finding Joe Mills
or nine-fingered Angie.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.868
If they're holed up somewhere,

14:40.922 --> 14:42.958
they got to come up
for air, cash.

14:42.965 --> 14:47.675
Get eyes on all these cab routes
Mills drove

14:47.720 --> 14:50.883
and shake down
the teen shelters again.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.174
Just do it again --
that's all we can do.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.676
Hey.
Hi, um, I found this outside

14:56.687 --> 15:00.646
that place the kids stay at,
the, um, Beacon Home.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.977
Where, exactly?

15:03.027 --> 15:04.358
Uh, I found it on my car,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.360
what, right after I talked
to the priest.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.488
Pastor Mike?
Yeah.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.865
You think it's got
something to do with Kallie,

15:10.868 --> 15:14.611
like maybe he's lying
and he knows where she's at?

15:14.664 --> 15:17.701
Did you see anyone
in the vicinity of your car,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.289
or maybe somebody watching you

15:19.335 --> 15:22.122
in the home or on the street?

15:22.171 --> 15:25.459
It's okay.
This is gonna help us.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.294
You'll let me know, right,

15:27.343 --> 15:30.335
like, if you find something
out, like, right away?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.344
Yeah, I will.
I promise.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.382
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.726
Whoever left that note
wants to be found.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.612
True, but they're not gonna get
caught out in the open

15:49.657 --> 15:52.569
talking to us about her,
not about their beloved pastor.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.909
You hungry?
No, we're not here to eat.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.413
Suit yourself.
I'm hungry.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.287
How can I help you?

15:58.291 --> 16:01.533
Uh, give me a Hawaii
with no ham,

16:01.586 --> 16:04.248
extra pineapple --
cold pineapple.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.916
- Don't be stingy on it, man.
- Okay.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.546
Holder.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.008
I remember you.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.599
You were looking for Bullet.
Did you ever find her?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.897
I saw Bullet last night.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.267
Guess she and Lyric
hooked up, huh?

16:27.320 --> 16:31.063
Yeah, the Lyric drama.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.276
Were you at Beacon Home today?

16:39.874 --> 16:42.581
You left this note?

16:42.585 --> 16:46.077
We want to help.
It sounds like you do, too.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.753
What's Pastor Mike lying about?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.840
I had bed at Beacon.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.256
I went out
on the roof to smoke.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.799
It was like 4:00 A.M.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.389
And I seen her in the alley --

17:02.438 --> 17:05.555
that girl that got away
from that killer,

17:05.608 --> 17:08.065
lying there like she was dead.

17:08.110 --> 17:12.444
But she was just out of it,
all cut up and bleeding.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.155
I called him, told him.

17:15.201 --> 17:19.160
Said he was nearby, in his car.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.161
He was in his car
at 4:00 in the morning?

17:21.207 --> 17:24.040
He got there right away.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.950
And as soon as he pulled up,

17:25.962 --> 17:27.247
that girl --

17:27.296 --> 17:30.504
she started screaming
and ran off.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.797
What did Pastor Mike do then?

17:34.804 --> 17:39.013
He got back in his car
and chased after her.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.936
He came back to Beacon
an hour later.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.681
He was alone, and...

17:49.235 --> 17:52.602
...he...

17:52.655 --> 17:54.737
he had blood
all over his shirt.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.074
I got to go.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.262
I'm gonna have this view
from my house one day,

18:20.266 --> 18:23.633
with all glass ceilings
so you can see the sky.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.725
Pastor Mike told me

18:25.855 --> 18:27.766
about these apartments
the government runs.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.524
You just got to fill out
the paperwork

18:35.573 --> 18:37.734
and get a job and stuff.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.076
Hey.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.238
What are you thinking?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.203
That you're beautiful.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.415
I've been totally in love
with you.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.339
ReaHy?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.558
It's gonna come down tonight,
the rain.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.233
We can't walk
the night out again.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.610
Come on.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.274
I'll find us a place.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.945
Yeah, I know.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.329
I have faith.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.505
According to our witness,

19:40.554 --> 19:42.260
he had contact
with Angie Gower.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.807
- The pastor?
- Yeah.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.101
Why isn't he just the guy
that took her to the vet?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.599
Then what's he lying
about it for?

19:47.645 --> 19:49.306
'Cause he's definitely
running us around.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.641
Look, he attacks her
in the park, she gets away,

19:51.691 --> 19:54.353
he catches up with her,
tries to finish the job.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.851
He was already in his car
at 4:00 in the morning

19:56.946 --> 19:58.686
and just minutes away from her.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.313
We have to at least vet him.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.482
He had contact with a lot
of our dead girls.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.911
All right.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.787
Let's get
a full background --

20:08.833 --> 20:11.449
DMV records, birth certificate,
credit history.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.332
But be discreet.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.959
And a search warrant
for his car?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.130
We don't have enough yet.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.287
He attacks them in the car.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.796
That's gonna be
our best chance for evidence.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.503
I'm not gonna smear
a minister's name

20:19.552 --> 20:21.008
over some
street kid's say-so.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.715
So work it if you want
that search warrant.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.057
And get eyes on his car.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.309
I don't want it disappearing
in thin air like Joe Mills.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.561
And what the hell are
you wearing, Holder?

20:38.446 --> 20:39.811
Come on, just for one night.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.107
We'll sleep on the floor.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.613
It's for Lyric, not me.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.569
Okay, you know
how the lottery works.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.700
We're full up
for the next two nights.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.198
How about those government
apartments you told me about?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.705
You think we can get
one of those?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.584
Maybe, but it takes time...

20:54.628 --> 20:56.038
and a deposit.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.579
And it's Sunday,
and the offices are closed.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.089
But if you're serious, then --
Look, look, look.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.754
It's her psycho stepdad, okay?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.753
He figured out where she is,

21:04.805 --> 21:06.921
and he's like, crazy, full on,

21:06.932 --> 21:08.547
screaming he's got a gun.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.386
Let me think of something.

21:13.439 --> 21:17.273
Give me some skin, PM.
you the man.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.559
I told them cops to lay off.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.148
I mean, they're totally
on the wrong track.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.779
What do you mean?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.440
I mean, they think that girl
came here, and she didn't.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.779
Right?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.574
Yeah. That's right.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.658
Cool.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.493
I got to jam.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.596
Get on.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.883
You got to be weighed.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.143
We need it to measure
the counterweight.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.773
Counterweight --
that's a nice word.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.608
Looking forward to it, Evan?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.522
I'm not on the execution team.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.952
Why not? Hmm?

22:08.994 --> 22:12.282
Don't like a good show?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.366
Huh?

22:13.415 --> 22:17.658
I don't have time for this.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.206
Get on the scale.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.836
Get on.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.176
Just give me a second.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.897
Look, they get
your weight right,

22:39.984 --> 22:44.318
your neck will break
like it's supposed to.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.357
You won't feel any pain.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.910
Seward, look at me.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.868
Get on, or I will put you on.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.810
Yeah, we've got eyes on him.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.436
We'll let you know if he moves.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.934
If you light it, it's gonna
start raining again.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.145
It's true.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.902
Jack still knows I smoke.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.615
Yeah, well, you ain't
exactly Houdini

23:35.664 --> 23:37.529
with them smokes, Linden.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.413
He wants me to move to Chicago.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.581
Chicago P.D.'s
a storied institution.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.921
It's good police.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.261
Cold as hell.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.719
What's holding you back?

23:55.768 --> 23:58.259
It ain't that boyfriend
of yours.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.270
I'm just a hire-back.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.977
Temporary police.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.059
You dodged that.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.652
So what's going on
with Mr. Boatman Cody?

24:12.368 --> 24:14.108
I'll beat his ass.
Just say the word.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.703
No, he got, uh, too attached,
I guess.

24:17.748 --> 24:21.332
I didn't mean for that
to happen, but I don't know.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.617
He's just a kid.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.120
Don't even go there.

24:30.552 --> 24:34.136
I guess I wanted to be
that person, you know,

24:34.139 --> 24:36.300
like, living on an island,

24:36.308 --> 24:39.596
working 9:00 to 5:00,
not smoking.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.010
But I...

24:44.608 --> 24:49.102
Sometimes what you get

24:49.154 --> 24:51.941
isn't really what you want.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.659
Where are those smokes?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.994
Detective Holder.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.254
What?

25:15.389 --> 25:18.881
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

25:18.934 --> 25:21.141
Thanks.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.974
Report came back on the pastor.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.849
Mike Sheehan died
four years ago.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.522
He's using a fake ID.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.107
Yeah.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.838
You know what Gary Gilmore's
last meal was, Ray?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.465
Steak and potatoes.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.046
Limit's 15 bucks nowadays,

25:55.095 --> 25:57.336
so you'll probably get
Salisbury steak.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.470
Come on, boss.
You got to pick one.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.895
How long has it been
since your last dessert?

26:03.896 --> 26:07.388
I want my lawyer.
Get him on the phone right now.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.181
What, you change your mind?

26:09.193 --> 26:11.275
You want the needle now, Ray?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.358
You guys are like clockwork,

26:12.404 --> 26:13.780
busting balls
when you get in here --

26:13.781 --> 26:17.114
I want my lawyer!

26:17.159 --> 26:19.070
Deadline's passed, Ray.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.576
- You can't change the execution method now.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.536
I'm sorry.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.609
Salisbury steak it is.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.072
Here you go, buddy.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.262
Holder.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.271
What are you doing?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.601
What the hell?

27:39.032 --> 27:42.240
There's no way to get blood
out of seats like that.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.618
Hey. It's a rental.

27:56.550 --> 27:57.665
Let's get out of here.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.003
Can I help you?

27:59.052 --> 28:02.089
We just have a few more
questions for you

28:02.139 --> 28:03.504
about Angie Gower.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.797
Why you got a rental, Mike?

28:04.850 --> 28:06.090
Excuse me?

28:08.145 --> 28:09.635
Busted up your ride,

28:09.688 --> 28:12.680
racing around town like you got
a Mad Tyte JDM?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.560
I have no idea
what you just said.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.731
Where's your car?

28:18.822 --> 28:20.528
It's in the shop.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.865
Oh, yeah? Which shop?

28:23.869 --> 28:27.578
I'm not sure why that's
any concern of yours.

28:27.623 --> 28:30.239
Angie Gower was seen
in the vicinity of Beacon Home

28:30.292 --> 28:31.372
a few nights ago.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.251
Then she never stepped
inside Beacon,

28:34.254 --> 28:35.755
like I told you.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.049
Now, if that's it --

28:38.091 --> 28:40.878
"In him we have redemption
through his blood,

28:40.928 --> 28:44.261
the forgiveness of sins --"

28:44.306 --> 28:47.093
Ephesians 1:7.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.383
You know your New Testament.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.385
What kind of forgiveness
you looking for, Pastor?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.357
Same kind you are,

28:57.402 --> 28:59.108
all of us are.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.812
Forgiveness is only part
of the verse --

29:01.865 --> 29:05.403
hope of heaven,
and grace to guide us

29:05.410 --> 29:08.573
through trials
and tribulations.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.322
Maybe instead of looking
for grace to guide you,

29:11.375 --> 29:13.240
you should own up to the truth.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.833
Thank you
for your time, Pastor.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.414
We'll get out of your hair now.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.139
You shouldn't have done that, Holder.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.765
Last thing we need is him
on the run, too.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.676
Yeah, I need you to run
a tat for me --

29:32.729 --> 29:36.642
Bible verse,
Ephesians 1:7.

29:38.735 --> 29:41.477
Yeah, call me back
as soon as you get a hit.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.898
Just as good as a print.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.438
Only if he's been
processed before.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.940
Yeah, you keep on staring,
Mikey.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.079
Pastor Mike?

29:52.124 --> 29:54.456
Find everything okay?

29:54.501 --> 29:57.584
Yeah. Thanks for letting us
stay here.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.130
Um, Bullet had to meet
with her P.O.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.127
She'll be a while,

30:00.173 --> 30:01.299
but I swear, swear, swear,

30:01.341 --> 30:02.672
we won't get in your way.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.458
It's no problem.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.803
Just got a hit
on your Bible verse.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.930
Your pastor's been
through the system.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.272
Real name is Mark Elwood.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.641
He did time?

30:20.694 --> 30:22.650
Well, close to it.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.778
Turns out Mark Elwood,
A.K.A. Pastor Mike,

30:24.823 --> 30:27.109
was charged with kidnapping
a 16-year-old girl

30:27.159 --> 30:28.899
in Tempe, Arizona,
six years ago.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.075
The girl got away,
but she O.D.'d before the trial,

30:34.124 --> 30:36.615
so the prosecution
dropped all charges.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.783
Elwood lost his ministry.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.167
He lost all funding
for the kids' shelter

30:39.212 --> 30:40.292
he was running in Arizona.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.830
So Pastor Mark
becomes Pastor Mike,

30:42.883 --> 30:46.091
cruises up the I-5,
finds a new hunting ground,

30:46.136 --> 30:47.842
gets a new alias
and a new bunch of kids --

30:47.888 --> 30:49.003
no problem.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.255
Let's pick him up.

31:19.169 --> 31:24.038
Sorry. Ijust... got
a little hungry.

31:24.049 --> 31:28.463
It's okay.
Have as much as you like.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.716
Can I ask you something?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.183
What would you have done

31:37.270 --> 31:39.727
if you weren't able
to stay here tonight?

31:39.773 --> 31:41.604
I know your stepfather's
not after you.

31:41.691 --> 31:45.058
That was Bullet's sales pitch.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.273
Don't worry, I'm not angry.

31:47.280 --> 31:51.740
We'd just... find
somewhere in the park,

31:51.785 --> 31:55.744
I guess,
under one of the bridges.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.242
I know what it's like
to be alone.

32:05.090 --> 32:09.925
I've had nowhere to go before,

32:09.970 --> 32:11.631
nowhere to turn.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.516
That's no way to live.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.475
Sometimes you
can't even really remember

32:23.483 --> 32:24.598
how you got there --

32:24.651 --> 32:25.982
it just happens.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.899
You don't even look like
yourself after a while.

32:29.948 --> 32:34.362
You wonder if people notice.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.489
And then you realize

32:40.500 --> 32:42.991
people only see
what they want to see, anyway.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.459
Bullet just called.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.969
She'll be here, like,
any minute now.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.611
Seattle P.D.!
Move! Move! Spread out, spread out!

33:11.907 --> 33:13.067
All right, let's go!

33:13.200 --> 33:14.610
Clear!

33:14.659 --> 33:16.695
Clear!
Clear!

33:16.745 --> 33:18.827
Downstairs dining room --
clear!

33:18.872 --> 33:20.203
Clear!

33:20.248 --> 33:21.363
Clear.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.872
All clear.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.959
We didn't pull the trigger
fast enough.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.168
Tipped him off.
He's gone.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.587
He's not at Beacon Home,
either.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.003
The team just finished the raid.
Must've just missed him.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.005
- How'd you figure that one out, genius?
- I was just saying.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.050
- Shut your stupid little face, huh?
- Hey! Hey, okay!

33:41.102 --> 33:42.842
Everybody out.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.810
Please, everybody.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.096
Out.

33:48.902 --> 33:51.143
He's a coward.

33:51.196 --> 33:55.030
He's preying on the weakest,
wearing that tattoo.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.155
I know who this guy is.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.032
Yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.901
Hold it together.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.946
Yeah, you're one to talk
about holding things together.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.535
Okay, you're right,

34:04.584 --> 34:07.041
so maybe you should shut up
and learn something.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.036
You go down this road,
you lose things.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.207
That's how it works.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.044
That's what you've got
to look forward to.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.094
That your girl?

34:21.142 --> 34:24.760
Uh, yeah. I'm just waiting
to talk to a detective.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.644
Me too.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.770
She missing?

34:34.114 --> 34:36.196
So's my daughter.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.281
Seven years now.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.193
We're from Eugene,
but when I heard

34:42.247 --> 34:44.533
these girls showed up
in the woods,

34:44.583 --> 34:47.040
I figured she might have made
her way north.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.577
I thought maybe one of the ones
they still haven't identified yet

34:50.630 --> 34:52.370
could be a match.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.086
Yeah, Kallie's not --
she's not dead.

34:55.093 --> 34:59.052
She's out there, somewhere,
maybe hurt or something.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.392
She always liked to wander.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.677
She just -- just picked up some
bad habits from me, I guess.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.232
Looks like you got
more school photos than me.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.980
Some are age composites

35:18.074 --> 35:20.611
we had done few years ago,

35:20.619 --> 35:22.780
medical files, dental records.

35:22.829 --> 35:26.367
It's just easier to keep them
than keep shuffling them

35:26.416 --> 35:29.123
from police station
to police station --

35:29.127 --> 35:33.245
whoever might have a Jane Doe.

35:33.298 --> 35:36.961
And when they turn up
inconclusive or negative,

35:37.010 --> 35:41.003
you think maybe, just maybe,
she's still out there.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.594
The maybes
are the hardest thing.

35:54.361 --> 35:57.353
Ms. Conrad?
We're ready to see you now.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.198
Straight ahead.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.827
Open it up!

36:08.208 --> 36:12.952
You were wrong about me having
control over anything.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.541
It's too late
to change the method.

36:15.590 --> 36:19.959
I didn't say you had control
over anything. You don't.

36:20.011 --> 36:24.675
I said that it was up to you
how you exited this world.

36:26.184 --> 36:31.178
I was talking about a choice
to forgive yourself, Ray.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.473
Salvation.

36:35.527 --> 36:40.988
Salvation is a place
for everybody,

36:40.990 --> 36:42.901
and there's peace there.

36:42.951 --> 36:46.694
But -- but it's a choice
to go there.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.622
They're clone.

37:08.685 --> 37:11.142
Till now, I've just done
lethal injection.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.269
Different than spiking
some convict's vein,

37:13.273 --> 37:14.433
I'll tell you that much.

37:17.193 --> 37:22.108
Now, the bigger the inmate,
the shorter the drop.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.190
A skinny guy needs
more distance to fall,

37:25.285 --> 37:27.241
make sure his neck snaps.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.494
For this one, 165 pounds

37:29.539 --> 37:32.076
gets him six feet, four inches.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.540
Do you pull the lever, dad?

37:34.586 --> 37:39.797
Yeah, well, they got
a whole procedure rigged up.

37:39.841 --> 37:43.333
I noose him --
put the rope around his neck.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.303
You know, I'm breaking the rules
getting you in here,

37:47.348 --> 37:51.307
but, uh, this doesn't come
around that often.

37:51.352 --> 37:55.015
Right and wrong, Frankie --
it's a choice.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.559
Hey.

38:02.155 --> 38:05.397
There's nothing
at the pastor's house.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.784
There's no matching weapon,
no trophies.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.825
If the pastor is good
for these murders --

38:12.874 --> 38:15.115
That still doesn't make him
for Trisha Seward.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.953
Only because we haven't found
the connect yet.

38:30.517 --> 38:34.806
Well, we got the timeline
from the ME.

38:34.813 --> 38:39.307
All our victims were killed
between June and November 2009.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.481
Uh, Trisha Seward was killed
December 26th.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.987
That's a full month later.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.693
So what?

38:47.700 --> 38:51.409
We know she's different.
Maybe there's a reason.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.864
Like what?

38:52.914 --> 38:55.030
I don't know.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.831
But we have an obligation,
we have a duty,

39:00.839 --> 39:03.296
to stop this execution
if there's reasonable doubt,

39:03.341 --> 39:05.297
and you know it.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.302
Listen, no judge
is gonna issue a stay

39:09.347 --> 39:13.966
based on a maybe, you know?

39:23.194 --> 39:26.357
He didn't do it.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.192
I believe you.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.721
Yeah?

40:00.481 --> 40:02.472
Okay.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.391
They found the pastor's car.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.698
Thank you. Thank you.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.085
We're sweeping
the train station now, sir.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.925
- How many trains left in the last hour?
- 12.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.173
All right, chase them down.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.758
I want officers at the first
stop for each train.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.261
Okay.
This way, sir.

40:41.314 --> 40:42.394
Yeah.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.316
We had him, Linden.

40:48.947 --> 40:53.236
Ashley, Kallie, all of them.

40:54.661 --> 40:55.946
We had him.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.957
I'm going back to headquarters.

40:59.999 --> 41:03.491
I'll get warrants for the train
station's surveillance cams.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.284
He's got to be on one of them.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.329
I'm sorry. We can't make
a statement just yet.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.501
Get out of the way. Let me in!
My girlfriend's in there!

41:51.509 --> 41:52.874
Watch it!
Lyric!

41:52.927 --> 41:55.134
- Hey. Easy. Settle down.
- Lyric!

42:16.576 --> 42:18.783
Drive.
