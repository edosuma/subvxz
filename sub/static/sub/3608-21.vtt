00:02.001 --> 00:03.753
Previously on Lost:

00:09.176 --> 00:12.345
I need you to go up through the grate
and into the vents.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.305
That button has to be pushed.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.807
OK.

00:23.774 --> 00:27.360
I crawled through your vents
and I stood at your computer.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.112
And you know what happened?

00:29.196 --> 00:32.865
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.660
I never pressed the button.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.872
If you want to do
something nice for Libby,

00:39.957 --> 00:43.167
there's a beautiful beach
three kilometers from here.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.669
You could take her there.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.754
Come on, give me the blankets.

00:46.839 --> 00:51.342
- Blankets?
- I will handle the blankets, OK?

00:51.427 --> 00:53.386
Take us to the guns. Now.

00:53.470 --> 00:57.807
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun. Ana Lucia.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.309
Why would she need a gun?

01:00.394 --> 01:04.980
We caught one of them. The Others.
He's locked up in there.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.400
Give me the gun. I'll kill him.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.235
I'm sorry.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.741
Michael?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.927
What are you building?

01:41.393 --> 01:44.604
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.940
So you gonna tell me? What is it?

01:48.025 --> 01:50.359
I'm building a church.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.279
Now, why the hell
would you wanna do that?

01:53.363 --> 01:57.366
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?

01:57.451 --> 02:01.621
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.998
A dream like this one?

02:13.425 --> 02:16.427
You need to help John.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.573
Yemi?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.995
Hello, brother.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.917
Yemi. Forgive me. I should have
listened to you. You were right.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.169
I didn't mean to do what I did.

02:51.380 --> 02:55.174
The work being done
in this place is important, Eko.

02:55.259 --> 02:59.887
It is more important than anything,
and it is in danger.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.392
You must help John.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.686
He has lost his way.

03:06.770 --> 03:10.606
You must make him take you
to the question mark.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.496
John will not want to show you,
so you must make him.

03:27.708 --> 03:33.713
Eko. There are many distractions,
brother, but you must move past them.

03:33.797 --> 03:37.425
What is done is done. Do you understand?

03:38.635 --> 03:41.053
Yes, Yemi.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.809
And, Eko? Bring the ax.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.278
What's the matter?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.373
You all right, mate?

04:17.048 --> 04:19.382
I need to find John.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.056
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.974
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.310
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.

04:29.394 --> 04:33.105
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that
the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale

04:33.190 --> 04:37.443
tried to strangle your little amiga
and it's on me when she goes vigilante.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.863
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough. Both of you.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.744
Michael. Hey.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.789
- He shot me.
- Who?

04:49.873 --> 04:52.708
- He's gone. He ran out.
- Go. I got him.

04:53.794 --> 04:57.797
I was sleeping and I heard gunshots.
I got up.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.467
I came out of the bedroom
and there was this guy.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.594
He had a gun and...

05:06.056 --> 05:08.808
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?

05:08.892 --> 05:11.644
Let me help you.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.020
She's dead.

06:07.367 --> 06:13.164
Kate, we gotta get her up. We gotta
get her up to the back room, OK?

06:51.328 --> 06:55.831
Grant us this mercy, O Lord,
we beseech thee.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.917
Amen.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.893
She's in shock. All right,
we gotta keep pressure on this one.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.439
Can you do anything? Jack?

07:20.524 --> 07:24.568
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.202
How is she?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.454
I'm doing what I can.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.290
- How long ago?
- What?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.960
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?

07:41.044 --> 07:45.131
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.969
We can pick up the trail,
catch up to him.

07:50.053 --> 07:54.557
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people. One's dead.

07:54.641 --> 07:59.645
Who's gonna take care of Libby while
you're off playing Daniel Boone?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.815
I will go.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.069
John, you have tracking experience, yes?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.113
Yeah.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.241
We will find his trail together.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.702
You find anything,
you come right back here

08:14.786 --> 08:19.415
and we figure out
what we're gonna do next together.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.715
Let's go, John.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.347
How long has it been
since your last confession?

08:35.432 --> 08:38.683
Good question. Too many years
for me to even remember.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.187
What do you wish
to ask God's forgiveness for?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.898
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.526
Well, I slept with another woman
besides my wife.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.821
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?

08:51.948 --> 08:56.535
To receive God's forgiveness
you must be penitent for your sins.

08:56.620 --> 09:01.707
I also forged ID papers
for a guy pretending to be a priest.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.212
Do you have it?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.887
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?

09:18.475 --> 09:23.354
You know, I've got some friends in Los
Angeles. I could get you on with them.

09:23.438 --> 09:28.150
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.488
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.

09:32.572 --> 09:37.243
Mr. Caldwell has been helping me
arrange my trip to the United States.

09:37.327 --> 09:42.164
I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.042
It appears we have a miracle.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.422
My daughter, she... she drowned.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.800
I'm very sorry for your loss.

09:52.884 --> 09:56.637
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.767
We were out in the backblocks
and Charlotte must have slipped

10:01.851 --> 10:07.231
and she went into the river
and she's not much of a swimmer.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.860
She was dead,
and the next day she woke up.

10:13.405 --> 10:16.865
Don't you understand? It's a miracle.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.202
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.

10:20.287 --> 10:24.081
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.667
And what does he think?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.753
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.257
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.

10:33.341 --> 10:38.137
The church needs to conduct an
investigation before anyone can be told.

10:38.221 --> 10:42.308
Father Tunde will start this process,
if you'll permit him.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.771
Mrs. Malkin, would you
excuse us for a moment?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.857
Of course.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.824
Monsignor, with all due respect,
I cannot do what you have asked.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.326
Why not?

11:00.410 --> 11:03.245
Because I do not believe
what this woman says.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.291
Why do you think I chose you?

11:20.096 --> 11:23.057
Are you seeing something I'm not?

11:23.141 --> 11:25.142
Hey.

11:30.023 --> 11:35.027
I haven't seen a single track or
piece of sign since we left the hatch.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.655
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.824
The what?

11:43.787 --> 11:47.289
The question mark, John. Where is it?

11:49.959 --> 11:53.962
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.965
I'm going back.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.553
I know you do not want to show me,
but you must.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.682
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.457
You hit me.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.962
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.258
Are you insane?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.343
No.

12:45.306 --> 12:49.977
Ana Lucia, your friend,
was just murdered and you...

12:50.061 --> 12:52.563
Ana wants me to help you, John.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.943
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.115
You don't know
what you're talking about.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.200
No.

13:09.539 --> 13:15.502
But you know what I am talking about,
John, and that is all that matters.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.047
Here. Here. You wanna find
your damn question mark?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.717
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.

13:21.801 --> 13:27.306
Because it's nothing. It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.267
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.

13:32.854 --> 13:37.649
If the swan is where we came from,
then we go that way.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.735
We shouldn't even be out here.

13:39.819 --> 13:44.490
Ana Lucia would still be alive

13:44.574 --> 13:47.367
if I'd just told Jack
that Henry attacked her.

13:47.452 --> 13:52.331
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John. Together.

13:53.750 --> 13:58.504
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.883
Tell me, John,
haven't you ever followed a dream?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.517
So, the Vatican's really interested
in this one, eh?

14:11.601 --> 14:14.436
That depends
upon what I put in my report.

14:14.521 --> 14:19.233
Why don't you just start
by telling me what happened that night?

14:19.317 --> 14:22.528
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.

14:22.612 --> 14:27.115
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.660
Have you had experience
in this type of death?

14:29.744 --> 14:33.330
Yeah, of course. I'm an undertaker.

14:33.414 --> 14:37.793
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.046
I mean, I did go to medical school.

14:42.507 --> 14:47.219
And when did you find out
that she was not dead?

14:48.179 --> 14:50.180
During the autopsy.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.226
During the autopsy?

14:54.310 --> 14:57.312
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.902
I figured you'd want
to have a listen for yourself.

15:03.987 --> 15:08.073
Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 161 centimeters, 51 .3 kilos.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.994
Body was prepped and washed
by the very lovely Valerie McTavish.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.413
Ian, stop it.

15:14.497 --> 15:18.041
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.003
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!

15:21.087 --> 15:24.089
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Val...

15:31.806 --> 15:33.599
Take it.

15:33.683 --> 15:37.728
No, please. I don't want to ever listen
to that tape again.

15:52.410 --> 15:56.163
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.915
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.

16:00.376 --> 16:04.463
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.

16:04.547 --> 16:08.383
I didn't draw it. I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.594
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the ax for?

16:10.678 --> 16:12.679
I don't know yet.

16:42.585 --> 16:46.213
You were the one
that found this plane, yes?

16:46.297 --> 16:48.298
Yeah.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.343
It was up there.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.933
And what made it fall?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.020
Boone.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.065
Boone made it fall.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.150
Then he died.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.238
Sacrifice that the island demanded.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.325
Excuse me?

17:16.327 --> 17:19.871
Nothing. So, what's next?

17:19.955 --> 17:25.292
We make camp, get some sleep,

17:25.377 --> 17:28.588
and wait for further instruction.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.885
Where in the hell are they?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.054
Just calm down.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.015
Finding his trail in the dark
is not gonna be easy.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.101
They'll be back.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.688
Jack.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.899
She say anything? Libby?

17:49.277 --> 17:51.820
She's still unconscious.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.989
The bleeding's stopped.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.950
- That's good, right?
- No.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.662
It's not good.

18:02.999 --> 18:07.586
- And there's nothing you can...?
- I can make her comfortable.

18:07.670 --> 18:11.256
But I don't have what I need.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.925
I gave you all the damn meds
two days ago.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.719
The heroin, Sawyer.

18:25.521 --> 18:29.900
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.

18:29.984 --> 18:34.571
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.616
Why would he need me to go with him?

18:37.700 --> 18:42.287
Jacko here knows his heroin's
in my stash with the guns.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.832
So I can either show you where it's at
or let poor Libby suffer.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.965
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty much it.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.723
Let's go, Freckles.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.913
- I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.666
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?

19:29.585 --> 19:32.754
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.174
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?

19:36.259 --> 19:40.595
Well, if I knew how she did it, she
wouldn't be able to do it, would she?

19:45.726 --> 19:46.685
After you.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.396
I thought you were taking me
to your stash.

19:49.480 --> 19:54.609
Do you have to make everything
so damn difficult? Just go in.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.214
You kept the guns here.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.217
All this time, right under you.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.636
Fooled you, didn't I?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.479
Hey, guys.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.190
You seen Libby around?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.554
Eko.

21:06.474 --> 21:07.599
Yemi.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.270
You'll wake John.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.651
Come. Follow me.

21:25.201 --> 21:56.940
Yemi.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.318
Wake up, John.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.410
Are you all right, John?

22:10.663 --> 22:13.415
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.793
You had a dream?

22:19.088 --> 22:21.172
Was there a man? A priest?

22:25.928 --> 22:28.179
The man that you saw was my brother.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.349
Your brother?

22:31.434 --> 22:34.561
This is why we needed to come together.

22:34.645 --> 22:38.023
This is how we are going to be led,
how we will know where to go.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.859
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?

22:40.943 --> 22:43.653
- No. He...
- Nothing? Anything?

22:43.738 --> 22:48.366
It wasn't even me. It was you.
It didn't...

22:49.410 --> 22:53.038
He wanted me to follow him.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.123
Follow him where?

23:06.343 --> 23:08.344
Wait here.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.308
Eko, it was just a dream. It's not safe.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.191
Eko.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.124
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.251
I must speak to your daughter.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.754
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.507
Just right this minute
it's not a very good time.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.968
All right. Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.805
- Richard, please...
- Inside. Now.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.274
I know why you're here, friend,
but save yourself the trouble.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.360
What happened here was not a miracle.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.655
The doctor that treated your daughter
feels differently.

24:08.739 --> 24:11.866
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.285
He's trying to cover up
his own negligence.

24:14.370 --> 24:18.581
He tell you the whole story,
how she supposedly drowned?

24:18.666 --> 24:21.501
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.629
She went into hypothermia,
which made her appear dead.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.298
Then why is your wife
so convinced otherwise?

24:27.383 --> 24:30.301
'Cause she's a zealot.

24:30.386 --> 24:34.097
All of this, everything she's doing,
it's to spite me.

24:34.181 --> 24:38.893
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.980
Because I make my living as a psychic.

24:42.064 --> 24:47.652
You see, that's what I do. I gather
intelligence on people and I exploit it.

24:48.529 --> 24:52.657
Every day I meet people
looking for a miracle,

24:52.741 --> 24:55.076
desperate to find one.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.913
But there are none to be had.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.375
Not in this world, anyway.

25:04.086 --> 25:09.174
I will report back to my monsignor
that there was no miracle here.

25:09.258 --> 25:12.719
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.

25:43.334 --> 25:46.586
Eko. Be careful.

25:54.094 --> 26:04.229
Eko.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.689
I'm fine.

26:30.756 --> 26:34.676
Hey, Eko. What's up there?
Do you see anything?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.761
I don't see nothing.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.418
- It's salted.
- What?

27:08.502 --> 27:12.297
The earth has been salted
so that nothing can grow.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.967
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.886
I believe they made a circle, a target,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.931
so that this place
can be seen from up above.

27:22.016 --> 27:25.685
They? What place?

27:25.769 --> 27:28.771
The place that this plane fell upon,
John. Come on.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.960
John.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.423
Will you help me with this?

28:20.616 --> 28:22.617
Wait.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.842
Eko.

28:39.927 --> 28:43.971
- May I?
- Please. Be my guest.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.327
We were gonna have our first date.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.709
Date?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.794
Yeah.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.714
Picnic on the beach.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.849
I'm glad you're OK, man.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.531
John.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.223
Hello. I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund,

33:37.307 --> 33:41.936
and this is the orientation film
for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.190
Station 5, or The Pearl,
is a monitoring station

33:46.274 --> 33:50.277
where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects

33:50.362 --> 33:54.365
can be observed and recorded
not only for posterity,

33:54.449 --> 33:58.035
but for the ongoing refinement
of the Initiative as a whole.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.538
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,

34:00.622 --> 34:05.793
"Careful observation is the only key
to true and complete awareness."

34:05.877 --> 34:08.670
Your tour of duty in The Pearl
will last three weeks

34:08.755 --> 34:14.051
and during this time you will observe
a psychological experiment in progress.

34:14.136 --> 34:18.013
Your duty is to observe team members
in another station on the island.

34:18.098 --> 34:21.391
These team members are not aware
they are under surveillance

34:21.476 --> 34:23.893
or that they are subjects
of an experiment.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.898
Working in eight-hour shifts,
you and your partner will record

34:27.983 --> 34:33.070
everything you observe
in the notebooks we've provided.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.614
What is the nature of the experiment,
you might ask?

34:36.699 --> 34:39.659
What do these subjects
believe they are accomplishing

34:39.745 --> 34:42.163
as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?

34:42.246 --> 34:44.790
You, as the observer,
don't need to know.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.960
All you need to know
is the subjects believe their job

34:48.043 --> 34:49.920
is of the utmost importance.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.257
Remember, everything that occurs,

34:53.341 --> 34:58.179
no matter how minute or seemingly
unimportant, must be recorded.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.265
Each time a notebook is filled

35:01.349 --> 35:04.435
with the fruits
of your diligent observation,

35:04.519 --> 35:08.481
roll it up, and place it
in one of the containers provided.

35:08.565 --> 35:12.568
Then simply place the container
in the pneumatic tube

35:12.652 --> 35:15.196
and presto,

35:16.448 --> 35:18.783
it will be transported directly to us.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.953
At the end of your eight-hour shift,
proceed to the Pala Ferry,

35:23.038 --> 35:26.624
which will take you back to
the barracks to prepare for your next...

35:26.708 --> 35:29.627
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso,

35:29.711 --> 35:33.088
and all of us here
at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.

35:34.591 --> 35:38.260
Namaste and good luck.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.401
Would you like to watch that again?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.112
No.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.532
No, I've seen enough.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.626
What are you doing?

36:10.710 --> 36:13.045
I'm taking this back with us.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.715
Why?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.343
Because they may be important.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.428
Important?

36:22.597 --> 36:25.933
I'm sorry. Weren't you just watching
the same thing I was?

36:26.017 --> 36:30.145
Yes, John, and I believe
the work you have been doing

36:30.230 --> 36:32.189
is more important now than ever.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.525
What work?

36:34.609 --> 36:36.610
Pushing the button.

36:42.117 --> 36:47.872
That's not work. That's a joke.

36:47.956 --> 36:51.542
Rats in a maze with no cheese.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.629
It is work, John. We are being tested.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.966
Tested?

36:59.050 --> 37:02.052
The reason to do it, push the button,

37:02.137 --> 37:05.055
is not because we are
told to do so in a film.

37:06.391 --> 37:12.396
Oh, well. Well, then,
what is the reason, Mr. Eko?

37:12.480 --> 37:15.482
We do it
because we believe we are meant to.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.194
Isn't that the reason
you pushed it, John?

37:23.074 --> 37:27.953
I was never meant to do anything.

37:32.083 --> 37:37.922
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

37:38.006 --> 37:40.674
is as useless as that button.

37:41.927 --> 37:45.095
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?

37:45.180 --> 37:47.514
It's nothing. It's nothing.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.935
It's meaningless.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.688
And who are you
to tell me that it's not?

37:58.068 --> 38:01.570
That's flight 815 leaving from gate 23.

38:01.655 --> 38:06.492
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.249
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.293
- Look, your father said...
- I know.

38:16.378 --> 38:20.255
He doesn't want me talking to you,
and I know you probably think I'm crazy,

38:20.340 --> 38:23.300
but I have a message for you
and I promised to deliver it.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.760
A message?

38:28.932 --> 38:31.976
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?

38:32.727 --> 38:33.811
Yemi.

38:38.108 --> 38:42.403
Speaking about my brother is not a joke,

38:42.487 --> 38:45.030
so you should be very careful
what you say next.

38:46.032 --> 38:51.912
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.582
He said even though you were pretending,
you're a good man.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.669
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?

38:58.753 --> 39:00.629
He will see you soon.

39:00.714 --> 39:05.217
He said that even though you don't have
faith in yourself, he has faith in you.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.263
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

39:09.347 --> 39:15.352
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?

39:22.444 --> 39:26.488
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.

39:27.615 --> 39:33.037
Oceanic Airlines flight 815
is now boarding for Los Angeles.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.041
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.

39:38.251 --> 39:43.797
Yemi was a great man,
a priest, a man of God,

39:43.882 --> 39:47.259
and because I betrayed him,
he was shot and died.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.889
He was placed on a plane

39:51.973 --> 39:54.308
which took off from an airstrip
in Nigeria,

39:54.392 --> 39:56.518
half a world from here.

39:59.981 --> 40:04.777
Then the plane that I was on
crashed on this island.

40:05.779 --> 40:10.240
And somehow, here,
I found my brother again.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.869
I found him in the same plane
that took off from Nigeria,

40:13.953 --> 40:16.455
in the same plane
that lies above us now

40:16.539 --> 40:19.249
that has concealed this place.

40:20.960 --> 40:26.965
And I took this cross from around
Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.

40:28.510 --> 40:33.931
Just as it was on the day
I first took another man's life.

40:41.815 --> 40:44.399
So let me ask you,

40:44.484 --> 40:48.278
how can you say this is meaningless?

40:52.784 --> 40:57.329
I believe the work being done in the
hatch is more important than anything.

41:01.084 --> 41:04.044
If you will not continue
to push the button, John...

41:06.548 --> 41:07.714
I will.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.542
Can...

41:44.711 --> 41:46.378
Can I talk to her?

41:48.381 --> 41:50.382
Sure.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.989
Hey.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.369
It's Hurley.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.372
Hugo.

42:33.968 --> 42:42.976
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.

42:51.152 --> 42:52.402
Libby?

43:07.835 --> 43:11.004
- Michael.
- Michael.

43:11.089 --> 43:15.050
He's OK. He made it, Libby.
It's OK. It's all right.
