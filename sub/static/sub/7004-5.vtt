WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:05.169
The trick is,
I towel-dry my hair first,

00:05.170 --> 00:08.138
Wait about five minutes,
and then I put on the mousse.

00:08.140 --> 00:11.309
Brad, you've been on the phone
for two hours.

00:11.310 --> 00:14.846
Yeah. I've gotta go.
My mom's bugging me again.

00:14.847 --> 00:17.381
All right, see ya. Bye.

00:17.382 --> 00:19.383
You see ashley all day
at school,

00:19.384 --> 00:21.886
Then come home and spend
all afternoon on the phone.

00:21.887 --> 00:24.388
What could you possibly have
to say to each other?

00:24.389 --> 00:26.257
Your life
is not that interesting.

00:26.258 --> 00:27.759
Maybe not to you.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.429
But ashley can't get enough
of my mousse stories.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.398
Hi, jill.
Hi.

00:34.399 --> 00:37.268
You won't believe
what I got.
Take it back.

00:38.671 --> 00:41.205
Something
to make your life easier.

00:41.206 --> 00:44.475
Binford's new universal
fan-cooled central
vacuum system.

00:44.476 --> 00:46.711
Ooh, is that
one of those things

00:46.712 --> 00:49.380
Where you just stick the hose
right into the wall?

00:49.381 --> 00:52.283
That'd be the one.
I have always wanted
one of those.

00:52.284 --> 00:54.786
It's the biggest and the best.
A binford demo.

00:54.787 --> 00:58.056
Didn't cost me a cent.
Take it back.

00:58.057 --> 01:01.126
I know what you're thinking,
but this thing - installation
is a breeze.

01:01.127 --> 01:04.828
That's what you always say,
and then the breeze
turns into a tornado.

01:04.830 --> 01:07.331
It won't happen this time.
Come on, jill.

01:07.332 --> 01:08.833
Come on. <i>(whimpers)</i>

01:08.834 --> 01:12.203
Don't make that face.

01:12.204 --> 01:14.372
I'll keep it simple
and just do one room.

01:14.373 --> 01:17.475
All I gotta do
is run a pvc tube
right down to the basement,

01:17.476 --> 01:19.510
Attach it
to the central unit.

01:19.511 --> 01:22.580
You swear
that's all there is to it?
J-jill...

01:22.581 --> 01:25.083
Just think - no more
carrying a heavy vacuum

01:25.084 --> 01:27.085
Upstairs
or back down the stairs.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.754
It's got
a lightweight flexible hose
with hand controls.

01:29.755 --> 01:32.891
Convertible upholstery brush.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.926
Crevice attachment?

01:34.927 --> 01:37.162
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, yeah.

01:37.163 --> 01:40.198
So long and so narrow,
it'll suck the tonsils
out of a cobra.

01:40.199 --> 01:41.766
<i>(makes sucking noise)</i>

01:43.268 --> 01:46.037
Well, it would be nice to have
a central vacuuming system.

01:46.038 --> 01:49.808
Yeah. Give me a week,
this whole house will suck.

01:53.045 --> 01:54.045
<i>(belch)</i>

02:42.060 --> 02:44.262
Hey, mark.
Hey, dad.
What happened?

02:44.263 --> 02:47.565
I'm trying
to dry out the carpet pad.
How'd it get wet?

02:47.566 --> 02:49.600
I made a little hole.
Where?

02:49.601 --> 02:52.270
In a big water pipe.

02:52.271 --> 02:54.605
Holy cow! What happened?

02:54.606 --> 02:57.541
I ran into a little snag
trying to run the wiring
back in through here.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.543
I think
I fixed the water pipe.

02:59.544 --> 03:02.380
I think I can
get the floor fixed
before your mom gets home.

03:02.381 --> 03:06.017
<i>(jill)</i> hello! I'm home!
Or maybe not.

03:06.018 --> 03:08.119
Hi, honey.
Hi.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.322
Hey, I thought you were
at the college library,
working on your psych paper.

03:11.323 --> 03:14.392
No, I couldn't concentrate.
All these young college boys
kept bothering me.

03:14.393 --> 03:15.960
Were they hitting on you?

03:15.961 --> 03:19.964
No. They thought
I was the librarian.

03:19.965 --> 03:21.299
Where you going?

03:21.300 --> 03:23.301
I have to finish this paper
by Friday.

03:23.302 --> 03:27.071
If I don't get it done by then,
I'm gonna be digging myself
into a big hole.

03:28.473 --> 03:33.778
So you could understand
how that sort of thing
might happen?

03:33.779 --> 03:36.815
Tim, there's a giant hole
in the floor!

03:36.816 --> 03:38.649
Oh, that's not a giant hole.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.751
The grand canyon
would be a big hole.

03:40.752 --> 03:43.387
You told me the hole
was gonna be this big.

03:43.388 --> 03:45.656
It is. I had to move
the water pipes over...

03:45.657 --> 03:47.491
The same old story
every time.

03:47.492 --> 03:49.493
You come up with
some idiotic idea,

03:49.494 --> 03:51.495
I say no, you make
a pathetic little face...

03:51.496 --> 03:53.331
...I couldn't get
underneath here...

03:53.332 --> 03:55.166
...You're pulling up
the floor.

03:55.167 --> 03:58.236
That's why
I pulled up the floor.
I can't even use my computer.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.238
Just once,
I'd like to come home

04:00.239 --> 04:02.240
And find the house
in one piece.

04:02.241 --> 04:05.076
It would have been
if you hadn't shown up
two hours early.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.411
So this is my fault?
In a way, yes.

04:07.412 --> 04:09.580
You would have never known
about this

04:09.581 --> 04:12.483
If you had proper study habits.

04:12.484 --> 04:14.552
Tim, please,
just fix the hole...

04:14.553 --> 04:17.322
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
...And then fix the one
in your head.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.726
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

04:21.726 --> 04:23.761
I'll get it.

04:27.266 --> 04:28.933
Marty?
Hey, tim.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.502
Come on in.
What are you doing? Hi.

04:31.503 --> 04:35.506
What are you doing?
I'm in town
on a sales trip. Thanks.

04:35.507 --> 04:37.041
Hey!

04:37.042 --> 04:38.409
Good to see you.
You, too.

04:38.410 --> 04:42.146
Honey!
<i>(jill)</i> I'm not talking
to you!

04:42.147 --> 04:44.448
Little argument.
Uh, the hole?

04:44.449 --> 04:47.585
The hole, yeah.

04:47.586 --> 04:50.821
Jill,
my brother's here.
Danny?

04:50.822 --> 04:54.492
No, the one that doesn't
owe me money.
Marty?

04:54.493 --> 04:55.994
Marty!
Hey, jill.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.828
How are you?
Good, good.

04:57.829 --> 05:00.064
How's nancy?
How are those little babies?

05:00.065 --> 05:02.133
Oh, this is
such a surprise!

05:02.134 --> 05:04.135
Tim, you used
the good towels?

05:04.136 --> 05:07.705
I didn't want
to ruin my shop towels.

05:07.706 --> 05:10.909
Did I, uh, come
at a bad time?

05:10.910 --> 05:13.677
No, it's fine.
Everything's fine.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.248
It is. Fine.

05:17.249 --> 05:20.885
So, since it's fine,
why don't you hop
over the grand canyon

05:20.886 --> 05:22.720
And tell us
what's happening.

05:22.721 --> 05:25.556
Hey, look, I'm sorry
for just showing up
like this, you know?

05:25.557 --> 05:27.625
I tried calling,
but the phone was dead.

05:27.626 --> 05:29.727
The phone is dead?

05:33.832 --> 05:37.135
That must have been
that bunch of wires
I sawed through.

05:41.873 --> 05:44.909
Brad, I'll tell you when.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.911
I'm really glad
you showed up.

05:46.912 --> 05:48.913
Yeah,
you missed me, huh?
No.

05:48.914 --> 05:51.582
If you hadn't shown up,
jill would still be
chewing me out

05:51.583 --> 05:53.117
Over this little hole.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.119
She will not fight
in front of company.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.455
So as long as you're here,
she won't yell at me.

05:57.456 --> 05:59.457
Man, I wish nancy
was more like that.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.459
She doesn't care
who's around.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.595
Remember she yelled at me
at uncle henry's
memorial service?

06:06.198 --> 06:09.334
Marty, you lost
the man's ashes.

06:10.635 --> 06:13.904
I didn't lose 'em.
I got into the convertible...

06:13.905 --> 06:15.906
Which was your first mistake.

06:15.907 --> 06:17.908
And you're lucky
I saved your butt.

06:17.909 --> 06:21.112
Do you know how many
cigars I had to smoke
to make one uncle henry?

06:23.415 --> 06:25.916
How much longer
till the water's
turned back on?

06:25.917 --> 06:27.918
It'll be on in a minute.

06:27.919 --> 06:29.920
I'm gonna put you up
in brad's room.

06:29.921 --> 06:32.090
I'll put the kids together
in the other room.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.692
I wish nancy
and the twins had come.
I'm dying to see 'em.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.694
Yeah, but it's
just a quick trip.

06:36.695 --> 06:39.864
Brad, turn the water on!

06:45.837 --> 06:47.538
Ok, brad.

06:47.539 --> 06:51.009
Brad, you got to shut it off.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.443
Almost there.

06:52.444 --> 06:56.481
Tim, may I, uh,
speak with you privately?

06:56.482 --> 06:59.117
It'd be kind of rude
in front of our company,
wouldn't it?

07:00.452 --> 07:03.921
Sure you can't stay more
than a couple of days?

07:03.922 --> 07:05.523
Maybe a year?

07:05.524 --> 07:08.226
Does everybody know
what time it is?

07:08.227 --> 07:09.927
<i>Tool time!</i>

07:09.928 --> 07:11.929
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

07:11.930 --> 07:14.565
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
Whoo!

07:19.905 --> 07:22.340
Thank you, heidi,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

07:22.341 --> 07:24.442
I am
tim "the tool man" taylor.

07:24.443 --> 07:28.779
It's always a pleasure
to share the spotlight
with someone special in my life.

07:28.780 --> 07:31.582
My brother marty's here.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.584
My youngest brother
marty's here,

07:33.585 --> 07:36.154
The only brother
I can still beat up,
right, marty?

07:36.155 --> 07:38.156
Tim, are you gonna
introduce me,

07:38.157 --> 07:41.392
Or do I have time
to run to the cleaner's?

07:41.393 --> 07:43.561
Ok, al.

07:43.562 --> 07:46.630
And you all know
my assistant al borland.

07:46.631 --> 07:49.033
<i>(cheers, whistles</i>
<i>and applause)</i>

07:52.404 --> 07:56.107
Today, we're gonna be talking
about abrasives.
That's right.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.609
Abrasives can be used
from anything from your car

07:58.610 --> 08:00.111
To family heirlooms.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.146
"to family heirlooms"?
Like silver.

08:02.147 --> 08:03.481
Silver?
Jewelry.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.683
Jewelry?
I can go on.

08:05.684 --> 08:09.287
Well, you spend
all the time you want
polishing your family jewels,

08:09.288 --> 08:11.489
But we're talking
about car finishes.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.991
As you can see, we've got
several hoods out here.

08:13.992 --> 08:16.660
Matter of fact,
there's a couple of hoods
backstage waiting for al.

08:19.531 --> 08:23.434
He's apparently a little late
on his flannel payment.

08:26.171 --> 08:29.440
You know, one of these days
you're gonna run out
of flannel jokes.

08:29.441 --> 08:31.442
Oh, I don't think so, al.

08:31.443 --> 08:34.212
Not with my
<i>complete flannel joke book.</i>

08:40.784 --> 08:43.354
"why did the flannel
cross the road?

08:43.355 --> 08:45.523
"'cause al was over there.

08:45.524 --> 08:48.559
"hey, waiter,
there's a fly in my flannel.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.462
Please, take my flannel."

08:51.463 --> 08:55.333
There's also
the handy wallet-size version.

08:55.334 --> 08:58.536
"how do you keep an idiot
wearing flannel in suspense?

08:58.537 --> 08:59.803
I'll tell you tomorrow."

09:04.075 --> 09:07.077
If the finish on your car
is like this - it's in
pretty good shape -

09:07.078 --> 09:09.713
What you need
is just a mild abrasive
before you wax.

09:09.714 --> 09:12.383
For that,
we recommend binford's
2000 polishing compound.

09:12.384 --> 09:14.519
That's right.
A dab on a soft cloth,

09:14.520 --> 09:17.988
And you'll have a shine
you can be proud of.

09:17.989 --> 09:22.293
Look, I can see myself.

09:22.294 --> 09:24.629
Ok, now, if you want
to remove oxidation
from the surface,

09:24.630 --> 09:26.631
You need something
a bit more abrasive.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.500
Like a can of tim's personality.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.872
Of course,
a can of your personality
would be empty.

09:37.008 --> 09:40.044
What we recommend is binford's
super 2000 rubbing compound

09:40.045 --> 09:42.046
Before you polish or wax.
Right.

09:42.047 --> 09:44.382
This surface
cannot be brought back
with anything.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.884
What we need is
to take the paint off of this.

09:46.885 --> 09:49.320
For that, we need something
a little more abrasive,

09:49.321 --> 09:51.455
Maybe an 80-grit
wet/dry sandpaper.

09:51.456 --> 09:54.692
Exactly.
That'll remove your paint,
and you can start from there.

09:54.693 --> 09:58.962
But for even more
abrasive things, we move on
to sandblasters...

09:58.963 --> 10:02.166
<i>(grunts)</i>

10:02.167 --> 10:05.469
...Open-shoe grinders

10:05.470 --> 10:08.105
And the most abrasive
of all -

10:08.106 --> 10:10.208
The nagging wife.

10:17.916 --> 10:21.319
So what'd you think
of <i>tool time</i> today?
Oh, it was great.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.756
But only in this country
could a goof-off like you
get his own tv show.

10:25.757 --> 10:27.791
God bless america, huh?

10:27.792 --> 10:30.294
Want something
to drink?
Yeah. A beer would be great.

10:30.295 --> 10:32.129
Hey, how's it going,
tool man?

10:32.130 --> 10:34.765
Hey, paul, how you doin'?
Two cold ones.

10:34.766 --> 10:37.268
I'm not sure
jill's gonna be crazy
about that abrasive bit.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.270
No, no,
that's the beauty of it.

10:39.271 --> 10:42.306
I always save the bits
that'll make her mad
for when she's already mad.

10:42.307 --> 10:45.142
That way, I can't lose.
You're always thinking.

10:45.143 --> 10:47.578
I had that abrasive bit
worked out two weeks ago.

10:47.579 --> 10:50.214
But just my luck -
we're getting along,
I couldn't use it.

10:50.215 --> 10:53.551
So, uh... You and jill
fight a lot?

10:53.552 --> 10:55.419
Depends what you mean
by "a lot."

10:55.420 --> 10:57.921
How about all day, every day?

10:57.922 --> 11:01.058
That would be a lot.

11:01.059 --> 11:03.327
You talking
about you and nance?
Yeah.

11:03.328 --> 11:06.364
Seems like ever since
we had the babies,
all we do is fight.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.233
Good shot.
It's only been six months.
Give it a chance.

11:09.234 --> 11:12.002
When brad was first born,
I had to make a lot
of adjustments.

11:12.003 --> 11:15.038
I had to wait in line
for jill to give me a bath.

11:18.109 --> 11:20.911
I'm talking about
when I get home,
I don't even get a "hello."

11:20.912 --> 11:23.981
I didn't care
if she said hello,
I just wanted my bath.

11:25.384 --> 11:28.018
Nice shot.

11:28.019 --> 11:31.255
It's that old dart injury
I have.
Yeah. Old dart injury.

11:31.256 --> 11:33.257
No, I'm serious, you know.

11:33.258 --> 11:35.092
I come in from work,

11:35.093 --> 11:38.095
Nancy practically
throws me the babies
and says she needs a break.

11:38.096 --> 11:39.930
Get used to it, bonehead.

11:39.931 --> 11:41.932
Having twins
is a lot of work.

11:41.933 --> 11:44.902
Just breastfeeding them
has got to leave her
feeling drained.

11:47.238 --> 11:51.074
Remember that cyclone ride
we used to go on as kids?
Oh, I loved that cyclone.

11:51.075 --> 11:53.311
I loved it.
You couldn't stand it.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.313
I feel like I'm on it now.

11:55.314 --> 11:59.283
I swear, you know,
my life just feels
totally out of control.

11:59.284 --> 12:01.285
Ever since we had the kids,

12:01.286 --> 12:03.454
It seems like everything's
fallen apart.

12:03.455 --> 12:05.790
You saying you wish
you didn't have the kids?

12:05.791 --> 12:07.625
I don't know what I'm saying.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.127
I just know nancy and I
got no relationship anymore.

12:10.128 --> 12:13.130
It's not that bad.
It's pretty bad.

12:13.131 --> 12:14.264
How bad?

12:16.335 --> 12:18.569
I'm thinking of leaving her.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.070
What, are you crazy?

12:20.071 --> 12:22.072
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

12:22.073 --> 12:24.742
Running out on your family -
that's how it's supposed to be?

12:24.743 --> 12:27.244
I've done a lot of thinking
about it, ok?
Think about this.

12:27.245 --> 12:29.647
You're gonna go home,
grow up and act like a man.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.717
Don't tell me what to do.
Somebody's got to.
You're acting like an idiot.

12:32.718 --> 12:36.454
Don't call me an idiot.
What do you call a guy
that runs out on his family?

12:36.455 --> 12:39.457
This is just like you.
You never commit to anything.
Remember boy scouts?

12:39.458 --> 12:41.792
You're comparing my marriage
to the boy scouts?

12:41.793 --> 12:45.596
I don't need this. I thought
you'd be the one brother
that was gonna understand.

12:45.597 --> 12:47.865
What I understand
is you're being selfish.

12:47.866 --> 12:50.601
The hell with you.
I don't need this. Here.

12:50.602 --> 12:54.071
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
That's not gonna cover
the beers.

12:54.072 --> 12:56.407
Come on, marty!

12:56.408 --> 13:00.478
You're gonna run out on me
like your family,
you gutless loser?!

13:00.479 --> 13:03.013
And he's the brother I like!

13:14.426 --> 13:17.327
Hey, mom, when are we gonna eat?
I'm starving.

13:17.328 --> 13:19.830
Your dad and uncle marty
are bringing home pizza.

13:19.831 --> 13:21.832
They should be back
any minute.

13:21.833 --> 13:25.135
Ever since
you went back to school,
you've hardly cooked anything.

13:25.136 --> 13:27.872
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's been really hectic.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.708
Hey, I wasn't complaining.

13:35.847 --> 13:37.681
So, what are you studying?

13:37.682 --> 13:39.517
Randy, I came outside

13:39.518 --> 13:41.752
Because I wanted you guys
to stop bothering me.

13:41.753 --> 13:44.488
I gotta get this paper
for my psych class written.

13:44.489 --> 13:47.291
What's it on?
Mood disorders.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.161
You should do very well.

13:54.165 --> 13:57.234
Mom, I thought you said
dad fixed the telephone.

13:57.235 --> 13:59.670
Honey, I'm working here.

13:59.671 --> 14:01.772
I'm sorry, but I was
talking to ashley,

14:01.773 --> 14:03.774
And we kept getting
disconnected.

14:03.775 --> 14:06.544
She lives around the corner.
Just go over there.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.579
How long can I stay?

14:08.580 --> 14:11.649
Till one of us graduates.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.117
Cool.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.055
Where's the pizza?

14:18.056 --> 14:22.192
Pizza? Pi-
it's-it's being delivered.

14:24.095 --> 14:26.096
You forgot the pizza.

14:26.097 --> 14:27.598
It's marty's fault.

14:27.599 --> 14:29.099
Where's marty?
I don't know.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.569
You forgot the pizza
and marty.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.070
Tell you what happened.

14:33.071 --> 14:35.072
After <i>tool time,</i>
went to big mike's
to have a beer.

14:35.073 --> 14:36.474
Started talking.

14:36.475 --> 14:39.076
He's thinking
about leaving nancy.

14:39.077 --> 14:40.611
What?

14:40.612 --> 14:43.113
Said after the kids,
their relationship
kind of deteriorated.

14:43.114 --> 14:46.083
I don't think he knows
whether he's coming or going.

14:46.084 --> 14:48.919
Oh, my god.
Nancy must be devastated.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.721
He hasn't told her yet.

14:50.722 --> 14:52.890
Wait, he told you
before he told her?

14:52.891 --> 14:55.893
I'm the only one that knows.
Me and everyone at big mike's.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.829
Put a big crimp in happy hour,
I'll tell you that.

15:00.298 --> 15:03.233
Well, did you try
and talk him out of it?

15:03.234 --> 15:05.402
Of course I tried
to talk him out of it.

15:05.403 --> 15:08.038
Told him you don't bail out
and run away.
That was good.

15:08.039 --> 15:11.341
You just admit your life is over
and take it like a man.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.446
"your life is over"?

15:16.447 --> 15:19.316
Yeah...

15:19.317 --> 15:21.351
The bad part of it's over,

15:21.352 --> 15:23.888
And the good part of it
is just beginning.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.357
Oh, I hope marty's ok.

15:27.358 --> 15:29.894
He'll be all right.
He just has to cool off.

15:29.895 --> 15:32.730
When he comes home,
you should have him talk to me.

15:32.731 --> 15:35.065
No, he's my brother.
He's my problem.

15:35.066 --> 15:37.568
When you marry somebody,
you marry their whole family.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.303
What would you do
if one of my sisters
was in trouble?

15:40.304 --> 15:42.640
Run like the wind.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.682
<i>(humming)</i>

15:54.118 --> 15:56.453
Hey, wilson,
what are you doing?

15:56.454 --> 15:58.522
Tim, I'm pondering
my bonseki.

16:00.224 --> 16:04.227
Isn't it funny how guys
never get tired of doing that?

16:04.228 --> 16:05.629
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:05.630 --> 16:07.631
No, no, no, no, no, tim.

16:07.632 --> 16:12.469
A bonseki is a miniature
japanese rock garden.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.772
Wow. Let me see.
Don't touch it.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.774
You see, tim,
the zen buddhists believe

16:16.775 --> 16:19.276
That by contemplating
its tiny symbolic landscape,

16:19.277 --> 16:21.478
One can achieve
greater understanding.

16:21.479 --> 16:24.247
Maybe it'll help me understand
what's wrong with my brother.

16:24.248 --> 16:27.051
I had a fight with him today,
and I haven't seen him since.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.853
Really? I thought you two
got along rather well.

16:29.854 --> 16:31.822
Oh, we usually do.

16:31.823 --> 16:34.758
When my dad died,
he was only one, I was 11.

16:34.759 --> 16:37.761
Mom went back to work,
so I took care of him a lot.

16:37.762 --> 16:40.530
Hmm. That's a lot
of responsibility.

16:40.531 --> 16:42.566
Yeah. It was a lot
of good times, too.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.069
I taught him how
to do all sorts of stuff -

16:45.070 --> 16:47.972
Hawk a loogie,
shoot a spit wad.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.241
Boy, no one teaches
spit wad shooting
better than me.

16:51.242 --> 16:55.245
Well, I'm aware of that.
Your boys have launched
a few wet ones over my way.

16:55.246 --> 16:58.682
Taught him how to ride his bike,
drive his first car.

16:58.683 --> 17:03.553
So what you're saying
is you were part father,
part brother.

17:03.554 --> 17:06.189
Yeah. Kinda like a "frother."

17:08.827 --> 17:11.494
I'm afraid marty's about to make
the biggest mistake of his life,

17:11.496 --> 17:13.998
And there's not a darn thing
I can do about it.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.000
You wish there was
something you <i>could</i> do.

17:16.001 --> 17:18.167
Yeah. I spent most of my life
taking care of him.

17:18.169 --> 17:21.605
Tim, the roman orator
appius claudius caecus
once said

17:21.606 --> 17:25.175
That every man is the architect
of his own fortune.

17:25.175 --> 17:28.145
Now, marty is a man.
He's not a boy anymore.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.981
When he was a kid,
he'd listen to me
anytime I wanted.

17:30.982 --> 17:34.985
All I had to do was tie him
to a tree and pour root beer
on his pointed little head.

17:34.986 --> 17:37.655
Tim, I think
what your brother needs

17:37.656 --> 17:41.558
Is for you to be a brother
and a friend.

17:41.559 --> 17:45.629
Instead of a "frother,"
more of a "briend."

17:45.630 --> 17:48.866
In a manner of speaking.
Night, wilson.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.902
Sayonara, tim.
Uh, marinara to you, too.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.142
Hey, marty.
I just came
to get my stuff.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.476
Marty, stick around.

17:59.477 --> 18:01.912
Why? You want to
rip into me some more?

18:01.913 --> 18:04.347
Look, I'm sorry I did that
at the bar, ok?

18:04.348 --> 18:06.817
Nah, tim, you made it
real clear how you feel.

18:06.818 --> 18:09.887
I've had time
to think about it.
I think we should talk.

18:09.888 --> 18:13.791
Stick around,
have something to drink?
What do you want?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.126
Anything but root beer.

18:17.796 --> 18:20.898
I guess there comes a time
in our life where we're past

18:20.899 --> 18:24.134
Me tying you up
and pouring root beer
on your head, huh?

18:24.135 --> 18:28.706
It's like the roman guy
apricot said -

18:28.707 --> 18:32.342
"if you roam around
with architects, buy rocks,
put 'em in the sand,

18:32.343 --> 18:34.978
And you'll understand."

18:37.716 --> 18:39.883
Let me think about that.

18:39.884 --> 18:42.652
Where'd you go after the bar?

18:42.653 --> 18:46.323
Ah. Waited outside
for you to leave,
then I ducked back in.

18:46.324 --> 18:49.492
You know, had a beer,
ate a sandwich.

18:49.493 --> 18:52.529
Counted the flies
on the pest strip.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.397
<i>(both)</i> 43.

18:55.566 --> 18:57.567
I used to take care
of things for you.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.203
I can't do that anymore.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.939
I wasn't asking you
to take care of anything.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.408
I want...
I just wanted you to listen.

19:05.409 --> 19:07.177
Fair enough. Good.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.679
I'm listening.
Tell me what's going on.

19:11.883 --> 19:14.952
Nancy and I don't have
any time together anymore.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.454
I knew raising the twins
was gonna be hard,

19:17.455 --> 19:20.224
But I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

19:20.225 --> 19:23.794
She and I used to
reach for each other
in the middle of the night.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.329
Now we're reaching
for the babies.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.332
Little brother,
this is real common.
Everybody goes through this.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.902
When you were first dating her,
when you first got married,

19:31.903 --> 19:33.904
You were grabbing
for each other.

19:33.905 --> 19:36.940
Once you have kids,
it's the end of that tune.

19:36.941 --> 19:40.043
There hasn't been any music
in our house in six months.

19:40.044 --> 19:42.312
Whoa.

19:42.313 --> 19:44.181
Yeah. Tell me about it.

19:44.182 --> 19:47.017
No wonder you're so cranky.

19:49.654 --> 19:53.056
I know it probably feels
like the band packed up
and went on,

19:53.057 --> 19:55.759
But once the kids
grow up a little bit more,

19:55.760 --> 19:58.428
There's - becomes much more time
for you and nancy.

19:58.429 --> 20:00.264
You're saying
the band will come back?

20:00.265 --> 20:03.767
Maybe not all of the band.

20:03.768 --> 20:06.970
But at this point,
you're probably happy
with a kazoo and a whistle.

20:11.910 --> 20:14.411
You're telling me things
are gonna get better, right?

20:14.412 --> 20:17.480
There's no guarantees.
I just know things got better
for jill and I.

20:17.481 --> 20:20.184
But - but you're telling me
I shouldn't leave.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.853
I'm not gonna tell you that.
I can't do this.

20:22.854 --> 20:25.555
You gotta make
your own decision here.

20:25.556 --> 20:28.725
I can't imagine my life
without nancy.

20:28.726 --> 20:32.662
I can't imagine
any other woman havin' ya.

20:32.663 --> 20:35.199
I sure hate the idea
of leaving the kids.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.802
When they're not
puking and pooping,
they're really cute.

20:40.271 --> 20:42.306
They do grow out of that,
you know.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.342
Help me fix the distributor
on the hot rod, will you?

20:45.343 --> 20:48.345
I'm just looking forward
to the day I can pick up
one of the kids

20:48.346 --> 20:51.014
And nothing gooey
shoots out at me.

20:51.015 --> 20:53.583
<i>(laughs)</i>
you gotta wait a while.

20:53.584 --> 20:56.419
But then it gets really fun.
They walk, they talk.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.756
You can roughhouse with 'em,
go to tractor pulls,
teach 'em to be guys like us.

20:59.757 --> 21:01.791
Tim, they're girls.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.660
Are they?

21:06.497 --> 21:09.632
They're awful hairy
for girls.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:09.633 --> 21:12.169
Well, then, teach 'em
how to stay away
from guys like us.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.838
<i>(grunting)</i>
don't want 'em hangi''
around guys like us.

21:14.839 --> 21:17.507
<i>(grunting)</i>
you don't want 'em hangin'
around guys like us.

21:17.508 --> 21:19.176
It'd be no good.
No good.

21:19.177 --> 21:21.378
<i>(normal voice)</i>
you break this thing,
I'll kill you.

21:24.415 --> 21:26.416
Well!

21:26.417 --> 21:29.086
I finally finished my paper
in peace and quiet.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.621
Wilson let me do it
over at his house.

21:31.622 --> 21:35.959
If you were really smart,
you'd have let him write it.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.796
Did marty call?
Yup. He sounded
pretty good, too.

21:39.797 --> 21:42.732
It's such a struggle
when you're first starting out.

21:42.733 --> 21:43.967
Remember those awful fights
we use to have?

21:43.968 --> 21:45.835
Who could forget yesterday?

21:45.836 --> 21:48.505
Yeah, but no matter
what happens,

21:48.506 --> 21:51.508
We know
that you're not leaving me
and I'm not leaving you.

21:51.509 --> 21:53.676
So you forgive me
for putting a hole in the floor?

21:53.677 --> 21:57.047
That depends.
Does the vacuum work?

21:57.048 --> 21:59.783
<i>(scoffs)</i>
"does the vacuum work?"

21:59.784 --> 22:01.251
Watch this.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.354
<i>(switches vacuum on)</i>

22:08.659 --> 22:10.260
<i>(switches vacuum off)</i>

22:16.000 --> 22:17.901
<i>(mouths)</i>
