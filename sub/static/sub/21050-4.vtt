10:37.661 --> 10:39.197
We're the Beagle Birds,

10:39.255 --> 10:40.697
Ma's adopted daughters

10:40.755 --> 10:42.378
from across the pond, like.

10:42.436 --> 10:44.814
Did Ma ever mention
a pond to you?

10:44.885 --> 10:46.682
I don't think
she could swim.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.570
I don't even think
she showers!

10:48.647 --> 10:50.002
I smell a rat.

10:50.060 --> 10:53.557
We're from England, guv,
just a little Cockney, innit?

10:53.626 --> 10:57.025
Uh, meat pies,
bangers and mash...

10:57.150 --> 10:59.322
Britty, darling,
oh, there you are!

10:59.380 --> 11:00.605
Oh, thank you, gents!

11:00.663 --> 11:02.267
My sister and I
will be certain

11:02.388 --> 11:04.038
to tell
our dearest Mama Beagle

11:04.096 --> 11:05.167
of the gracious hospitality

11:05.224 --> 11:06.674
we've received here
in the Colonies.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.283
This is Brittania,

11:08.341 --> 11:10.658
and I'm, er...

11:10.721 --> 11:12.525
Englabeth.

11:12.853 --> 11:15.142
She talks fancy.
I trust her.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.033
Well, they are family.
I mean, why would they lie?

11:18.091 --> 11:20.791
Marvelous! Well, it was
wonderful to meet you.

11:20.932 --> 11:23.283
- I'm taking this.
- Well, um...

11:23.350 --> 11:26.713
A keepsake
of our serendipitous meeting!

11:26.893 --> 11:29.307
Stupendous!

11:31.401 --> 11:32.830
Ta-ta!

11:34.455 --> 11:35.821
Wait, was that them?

11:41.932 --> 11:43.752
You totally
clowned those jokers,

11:43.845 --> 11:46.624
and we got a radio
so we can track them!

11:46.682 --> 11:49.017
Where did you get
that tea-and-crumpets talk?

11:49.075 --> 11:51.932
I live with my British granny
in a Scottish mansion.

11:51.990 --> 11:55.686
I didn't hear an American accent
till I was, like, seven.

11:58.189 --> 12:02.017
With my brains and your weirdly
specific super-brains,

12:02.075 --> 12:03.314
we could run this town!

12:03.393 --> 12:04.885
Innit that right,
Englabeth?

12:04.943 --> 12:07.400
Most indubitably,
Brittania!

12:07.807 --> 12:10.610
Hah! Wait until the guys
hear my new nickname!

12:10.687 --> 12:13.588
You mean those three nerds
who ditched you on a beach?

12:13.665 --> 12:16.258
Yeah, they sound
real fun.

12:17.114 --> 12:18.396
Oh, no, no!

12:18.454 --> 12:20.150
There were only three spots
on the boat,

12:20.208 --> 12:21.379
so I let them go.

12:21.437 --> 12:23.658
We're cool like that.
It's a family thing.

12:23.736 --> 12:26.330
Family, huh?
Not really my thing.

12:26.578 --> 12:28.416
But family is the best!

12:28.605 --> 12:30.252
You go on adventures together,

12:30.310 --> 12:31.541
make inside jokes!

12:31.599 --> 12:34.439
Like there was
this hilarious joke

12:34.572 --> 12:37.799
where they went out boating
and Huey got them lost,

12:37.869 --> 12:41.353
and since then, they call
him Captain Lost!

12:41.411 --> 12:44.361
[laughter falls]
Yeah, I don't get it, either.

12:44.454 --> 12:48.189
Uff! Sometimes it's like they
have their own secret language.

12:48.247 --> 12:50.014
It's just...
I don't know.

12:50.072 --> 12:51.775
They have so much
history together.

12:51.864 --> 12:54.103
Well, now
we have history.

12:59.109 --> 13:00.749
- [rustling]
- [gasps]

13:04.025 --> 13:06.266
- [screams]
- Lena, no!

13:06.343 --> 13:08.610
These are the guys
I was talking about!

13:08.687 --> 13:10.150
- Oh.
- [groans]

13:10.420 --> 13:13.670
Lena, this is Huey,
Dewey, and Louie.

13:13.736 --> 13:16.142
Webby, we've been looking
for you everywhere!

13:16.284 --> 13:19.580
Cute, with the names
and the color-coded outfits.

13:19.705 --> 13:22.490
Is that, like, your thing,
you're all exactly the same?

13:22.567 --> 13:25.318
[all] Hah! No way!
We're all unique snowflakes!

13:25.471 --> 13:26.869
Well, this usually
never happens!

13:26.927 --> 13:29.061
This is really weird!
Okay, stop talking!

13:29.320 --> 13:31.245
Antidisestablishmentarianism!

13:31.315 --> 13:33.142
Seriously? Gah!

13:34.324 --> 13:36.161
Seriously, Webby,
where have you been?

13:36.242 --> 13:37.676
We've been worried
out of our minds!

13:37.749 --> 13:40.167
Well, uh, Lena and I...

13:40.244 --> 13:43.242
Right, you were so worried
that you left her on a beach

13:43.300 --> 13:45.133
and didn't show up
for four hours?

13:45.191 --> 13:46.242
We got lost!

13:46.300 --> 13:48.199
Thanks to old
Captain Lost!

13:48.257 --> 13:50.297
Why would you put me
in charge of the map again?

13:50.354 --> 13:51.524
This is not on me.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.110
Captain Lost!
Captain Lost!

13:54.168 --> 13:56.774
Ooh, you change
the tone of that chant!

13:56.832 --> 13:59.289
Ye

13:59.414 --> 14:03.313
Guys, easy! We were
just having a little adventure.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.392
[trees whistling]

14:05.469 --> 14:06.953
[owl hoots]

14:08.602 --> 14:09.641
What was that?

14:09.699 --> 14:11.457
Shh!

14:13.677 --> 14:16.086
- [grunts]
<i>- Ma to the Tumblebums.</i>

14:16.202 --> 14:18.302
<i>The rugrats have been spotted
in your turf.</i>

14:18.590 --> 14:21.156
<i>Make 'em sorry
they crashed our party!</i>

14:21.260 --> 14:23.426
The Tumblebums?
They sound adorable!

14:23.628 --> 14:25.287
[evil cackling]

14:33.369 --> 14:34.524
Never mind.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.860
- No way! You check!
- No, you check!

14:39.937 --> 14:41.288
- Ohh...
- You go right now!

14:41.404 --> 14:43.996
[indistinct arguing]

14:47.896 --> 14:49.887
Why are the Beagle Boys
even after you?

14:49.945 --> 14:51.755
Because we shoved
their mother's face in a cake.

14:51.812 --> 14:53.205
Try to keep up, Louie.

14:53.354 --> 14:55.984
Heh! Well, we've kind of
been having a girls' night.

14:56.205 --> 14:58.393
[animalistic shouts]

14:58.744 --> 15:00.127
We need a plan.

15:00.185 --> 15:02.909
Okay, we've got a compass,
a half-empty canteen,

15:03.060 --> 15:05.052
three old banana peels...
Wait, wait, three?

15:05.137 --> 15:06.044
Did you eat my banana? -

15:06.102 --> 15:07.558
Yeah,
it's called stress eating, okay,

15:07.615 --> 15:10.471
- and it's a stressful situation.
- [grunting]

15:12.774 --> 15:15.279
Hey, I need
my potassium!

15:15.847 --> 15:17.898
Let's make
a break for it.

15:17.967 --> 15:19.833
- What?
- Let the boy band be bait

15:19.891 --> 15:21.015
while we sneak out.

15:21.073 --> 15:22.771
I can't leave them!

15:22.829 --> 15:25.318
You mean like they left
you alone on that beach?

15:25.568 --> 15:27.606
Come on, don't
you trust me?

15:29.086 --> 15:32.193
[boys grunting]

15:33.021 --> 15:34.521
Wait right here.

15:34.776 --> 15:36.099
[scoffs] Whatever.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.357
[all grunting]

15:37.591 --> 15:38.662
Stop.
Think.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.334
Okay, how do you get rid of
an evil clown?

15:59.564 --> 16:01.063
[evil cackling]

16:05.130 --> 16:06.915
Yah!

16:09.793 --> 16:11.477
[boys cheering]

16:11.535 --> 16:13.251
Lena, did you see that?

16:13.680 --> 16:15.730
- Lena?
- [boys cheering]

16:26.455 --> 16:27.594
You okay?

16:27.652 --> 16:28.918
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:29.019 --> 16:30.103
It's dumb.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.167
I just...
I thought Lena and I

16:32.277 --> 16:34.597
could maybe have
what you three have.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.777
I promise we'll never leave
you off the boat again.

16:37.874 --> 16:40.331
We'll leave Louie.
He's bad at most things.

16:40.420 --> 16:41.645
[both laughing]

16:43.894 --> 16:46.831
"Webby, I've been kidnapped
by the Beagle Boys."

16:46.964 --> 16:49.386
Wait, is this another prank?

16:50.646 --> 16:53.226
"This is not a prank.
Lena."

16:53.284 --> 16:55.909
She didn't ditch me!
She was captured!

16:55.979 --> 16:57.964
Oh, wait,
she was captured.

17:00.877 --> 17:02.394
[gasps]

17:02.692 --> 17:03.737
Aah!
[grunts]

17:03.822 --> 17:05.771
[radio static]

17:05.848 --> 17:07.847
[Ma Beagle]
<i>I'm on my way, boys.</i>

17:08.050 --> 17:10.166
<i>I may not have gotten
to eat my birthday cake,</i>

17:10.284 --> 17:12.877
<i>but at least I'll get
a little slice of revenge.</i>

17:13.029 --> 17:14.545
We have to help her!

17:14.603 --> 17:15.741
We should go
get Uncle Scrooge

17:15.798 --> 17:17.948
and Beakley
and a couple of tanks.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.472
There's no time.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.339
Look, me and Lena
fought a truck

17:21.405 --> 17:23.425
and beat the Taquitos
and were British together.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.058
I don't know what
any of that means.

17:25.242 --> 17:27.636
Now you know how I feel
half the time.

17:27.694 --> 17:28.887
You wouldn't leave
each other behind

17:28.944 --> 17:30.284
and I'm not leaving her.

17:30.402 --> 17:31.737
Now, come on!

17:31.795 --> 17:35.105
And this time I'm getting
a spot in the stupid boat!

17:42.046 --> 17:44.947
Uh, guys, I kind of got
a situation here.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.446
A little help?

17:46.504 --> 17:48.588
[grunting]

17:48.789 --> 17:50.046
Rough day, huh?

17:50.132 --> 17:51.571
Well, here.

17:58.884 --> 18:01.010
Psst, over here!

18:03.620 --> 18:05.493
Webby, you came!

18:05.551 --> 18:07.032
Like I would ditch you.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.329
We're the Beagle Birds.

18:09.454 --> 18:11.712
[Webby grunting]

18:21.987 --> 18:25.480
You two ladies have given us
a lot of trouble tonight.

18:25.556 --> 18:28.392
But it'll be worth it
when Ma sees her birthday gift.

18:28.450 --> 18:30.834
And we got some early
Mother's Day shopping

18:30.892 --> 18:33.048
- out of the way, too.
- [laughing]

18:33.106 --> 18:35.536
Big Time to Ma, Big Time
to Ma, what's your 10-20?

18:35.642 --> 18:39.602
Seriously, your rescue plan
was to throw yourself blindly

18:39.660 --> 18:42.169
into the middle of the
entire Beagle Family?

18:42.227 --> 18:45.271
How is that any different than
what you did at the junkyard?

18:45.329 --> 18:48.267
I wasn't tied up
at the junkyard.

18:48.884 --> 18:50.524
Now they have
what we have.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.128
Now I remember
why I avoid family.

18:53.186 --> 18:56.313
- All they do is...
- Fight?

18:56.828 --> 18:59.415
Okay, Ma should be here
any second.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.340
When Botched Job
gives the signal,

19:01.398 --> 19:03.462
we all leap out
and yell surprise.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.977
- Any questions?
- [Lena] Yeah, I got one.

19:06.058 --> 19:08.529
Which one of you
gets to hand us over?

19:08.587 --> 19:09.665
Say what, now?

19:09.723 --> 19:11.649
I mean, you could
all hand us over

19:11.707 --> 19:13.634
and share the credit,
or...

19:13.715 --> 19:16.128
Well, obviously
we should do it.

19:16.186 --> 19:17.901
I mean, we're, like,
the main guys, right?

19:17.959 --> 19:20.009
- Give someone else a chance.
- Yeah.

19:20.079 --> 19:21.912
We're, like,
anti-authority, bro.

19:21.970 --> 19:23.408
We don't believe
in following.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.557
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure
they was adopted.

19:25.615 --> 19:27.909
Now that was uncalled for,
Mister.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.800
Even if I have heard
the same rumor.

Aww.

20:59.687 --> 21:01.504
That was awesome!

21:01.562 --> 21:03.362
How you made the Beagle
Boys fight each other

21:03.420 --> 21:04.767
so we could escape,
and then...

21:04.825 --> 21:07.316
Well, you shimmied up
that pillar like a pro.

21:07.374 --> 21:09.196
You turned the entire
Beagle family

against each other
with a question.

That's what family's
about, eh, Englabeth?

21:16.413 --> 21:19.684
Oh, I knew you'd come through
in a spot, Brittania.
