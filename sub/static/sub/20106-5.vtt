WEBVTT

00:05.962 --> 00:08.500
So, uh, what are we doing?

00:08.551 --> 00:10.004
Are we just
jumping right into this,

00:10.067 --> 00:11.458
or what's the deal?

00:14.121 --> 00:16.512
Alrighty!
And how's our patient?

00:16.739 --> 00:20.301
And, follow up, where is our patient?

00:20.512 --> 00:21.808
Meaning?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.410
Okay, you know what?

00:23.457 --> 00:25.379
You're about as helpful
as tits on a...

00:26.496 --> 00:27.582
You!

00:27.649 --> 00:29.774
Look what you've done to me!

00:29.860 --> 00:32.524
Yeah, right?
I'm a monster!

00:32.633 --> 00:35.157
You're a miracle!
You didn't even have feet!

00:35.243 --> 00:37.977
Now look at you,
walking around on new legs,

00:38.054 --> 00:39.957
with hands
that can crush steel...

00:39.992 --> 00:43.857
And, I mean, don't
try it right now, obviously, but...

00:44.177 --> 00:45.974
Look at me!

00:46.099 --> 00:47.694
I'm a Goddamn freak!

00:47.763 --> 00:50.499
And I don't know
who I'm gonna kill first,

00:50.614 --> 00:52.864
you or that
son of a bitch Len Trexler.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.161
Well, first of all,
it's "whom."

00:55.216 --> 00:56.622
Uh, no, it isn't.

00:56.669 --> 00:58.169
It absolutely is.
Doesn't matter.

00:58.247 --> 01:00.114
But if it'll help you decide,

01:00.232 --> 01:02.392
this serum, which is sort of
the key to the whole deal,

01:02.435 --> 01:03.646
I call factor-K.

01:03.736 --> 01:05.354
- And?
- And your body

01:05.453 --> 01:06.754
will reject its new components,

01:06.857 --> 01:08.153
and you will die in agony,

01:08.216 --> 01:09.864
unless you get
an injection of it.

01:09.911 --> 01:12.661
Wha... well,
give it here, shitbeard.

01:12.825 --> 01:15.169
Uhh! Goddamn it.

01:15.364 --> 01:17.341
Ow. Okay, that kind of hurt,

01:17.435 --> 01:19.700
and I'm already
in a pretty bad mood,

01:19.778 --> 01:21.513
so I'm gonna kill you first.

01:21.607 --> 01:23.247
So, any last words?

01:23.357 --> 01:25.177
Every 12 hours.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.771
Cryptic. Nice.

01:26.888 --> 01:28.739
Usually people just
blubber and beg,

01:28.825 --> 01:31.575
and those big gloobs of snot
run outta their nose, but you...

01:31.660 --> 01:34.707
if you don't get a shot
of factor-K every 12 hours,

01:34.769 --> 01:35.887
you will die.

01:35.958 --> 01:38.034
- Bullshit.
- Which... and that's fair,

01:38.059 --> 01:38.994
- but...
- Let me guess.

01:39.019 --> 01:42.144
You're only gonna make enough
for one injection at a time.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.894
Well, I am now.

01:43.956 --> 01:46.870
- Goddamn it! Yeah,
- So, like an insurance policy.

01:46.964 --> 01:49.667
- How long does it take you to make it?
- I don't know. An hour?

01:49.732 --> 01:52.610
Well, then, I guess I'll
wake you up in about 11 hours.

01:52.878 --> 01:54.721
Wake me...

01:56.370 --> 01:59.333
What the... are you...

01:59.644 --> 02:02.855
Dreamland... has a whole Goddamn

02:02.941 --> 02:06.230
Nazi Robot farm in the basement.

Hello!
Can anybody hear me?

03:05.697 --> 03:07.917
Man, that thing
is outta control.

03:08.070 --> 03:10.270
Hello! Hello!

03:10.343 --> 03:12.355
Somebody! Hey!

03:12.523 --> 03:15.449
What the...
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

03:15.886 --> 03:18.695

03:18.855 --> 03:21.074
My Goddamn pubes are on fire!

03:21.145 --> 03:23.222
All right.
I guess let him out.

03:23.386 --> 03:24.964
Now that second lunch is ruined.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.680
Aw, man!
Some of it got in my mouth.

03:30.839 --> 03:33.105
How long was I in there?

03:33.159 --> 03:34.464
How should I know?

03:34.522 --> 03:37.422
Usually dead people don't just
climb out of these drawers

03:37.496 --> 03:39.355
with their big bushy
birds on fire,

03:39.449 --> 03:41.472
so for all I know,
you're that Zombie

03:41.544 --> 03:43.558
- that got walked with!
- That what?

03:43.583 --> 03:46.883
In the movie <i>I walked with a Zombie.
The Zombie Titular.</i>

03:47.073 --> 03:48.285
I'm not a Goddamn...

03:48.320 --> 03:52.090
I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis,
LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!

03:52.138 --> 03:55.503
- I showed you my shield!
- And if you'd show it to me again...

03:55.567 --> 03:57.688
I don't...
whoever hit me took it.

03:58.024 --> 03:59.994
Goddamn it!
And my service weapon!

04:00.019 --> 04:01.941
And yet they left you
your lighter.

04:02.062 --> 04:04.972
Wait. When I got pistol-whipped,
I was talking to an English guy.

04:05.127 --> 04:06.287
We don't have an English guy.

04:06.323 --> 04:08.144
I... you have to remember me!

04:08.195 --> 04:11.339
Uh, actually, I don't.
And also, I don't, so...

04:11.365 --> 04:14.566
- Oh, you think you're pretty smart,
- Huh? I mean, smart enough to know

04:14.636 --> 04:16.870
you cut a finger off one of my cadavers...

04:16.894 --> 04:20.166
- which, ew.
- And also gross abuse of a corpse,

04:20.230 --> 04:21.488
which is punishable by...

04:21.565 --> 04:23.964
I know all about
gross abuse of a corpse!

04:24.069 --> 04:26.365
Yeah, that's kind of my whole point.

04:27.218 --> 04:30.277
As the lord our God himself
is my witness,

04:30.394 --> 04:33.042
upon the conclusion
of my current business,

04:33.152 --> 04:34.785
I shall return to this place

04:34.899 --> 04:39.097
and visit upon you an apocalypse
of such terror and destruction

04:39.164 --> 04:43.933
that you will rue... rue the very
fact of your miserable birth!

04:45.463 --> 04:47.136
I'll be here.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.511
I actually won't.
Well, unless it's before Friday.

04:51.581 --> 04:54.136
Oh, yeah, that's right.
What's it you're leaving to do?

04:54.253 --> 04:57.170
- Lumber inspector.
- Huh. Didn't know that was a thing.

04:57.238 --> 04:59.105
That's because
you have no vision.

04:59.191 --> 05:02.339
- This, Danny...
- This is your world.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.215
Yeah.

05:04.589 --> 05:07.113
Please, Figgis, for your sake,
tell me you're joking.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.451
<i>It's just a temporary setback,</i>

05:08.487 --> 05:10.714
<i>but I am going to fix this,
trust me.</i>

05:10.800 --> 05:13.144
That's the whole point.
I don't trust you.

05:13.192 --> 05:17.074
I wouldn't trust you
to fix potato Salad!

05:17.229 --> 05:19.559
You're probably
one of those assholes

05:19.636 --> 05:21.191
who puts relish in it!

05:21.268 --> 05:25.504
I mean, first my whores,
and now Charlotte Vandertunt?

05:25.584 --> 05:27.944
<i>How many women can one man lose?</i>

05:28.040 --> 05:29.660
Oh, plus your wife.
Would you...

05:29.742 --> 05:31.752
Oh! Mr. Trexler,

05:31.816 --> 05:35.339
I swear to God that I will
get you your million dollars.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.393
<i>You know, you say that
with the confidence of a man</i>

05:37.417 --> 05:38.879
<i>who has a lot longer to live.</i>

05:38.922 --> 05:40.300
I...

05:42.058 --> 05:43.386
How'd that go?

05:43.433 --> 05:45.019
How do you think it went?

05:45.135 --> 05:46.433
- Not great.
- Ya think?

05:46.458 --> 05:47.463
Yes.

05:47.488 --> 05:49.043
Because while I was
getting pistol-whipped

05:49.067 --> 05:50.660
and shoved in a drawer
at the morgue...

05:50.731 --> 05:53.535
losing precious time, not to
mention my gun and my shield...

05:53.628 --> 05:55.738
you were supposed to find
Charlotte Vandertunt.

05:55.785 --> 05:57.511
And, so, how did that go?

05:57.628 --> 05:59.930
Also not great.
But more importantly...

05:59.988 --> 06:01.824
because we know Archer
broke her out of jail,

06:01.872 --> 06:03.730
and we know he's working
for mother, so...

06:03.808 --> 06:04.939
Son of a bitch!

06:04.967 --> 06:07.113
I bet she's gonna try
to ransom Charlotte!

06:07.238 --> 06:09.550
Wait. Shut up.
"More importantly" what?

06:09.608 --> 06:12.516
- What is that smell?
- What is what smell?

06:12.664 --> 06:15.702
That. Smells like cuy.

06:15.788 --> 06:18.288
- What the hell is cuy?
- Roasted Guinea pig.

06:18.363 --> 06:19.847
- Huh?
- They blowtorch the

06:19.886 --> 06:20.814
hair right off of it.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.900
- It's like the national dish of Peru.
- Did...

06:22.924 --> 06:24.565
- Or is it Ecuador?
- Did you...

06:24.599 --> 06:27.019
which one's the native habitat
of the spectacled bear?

06:27.054 --> 06:29.519
- Did...
- Wait. Shit. They both are.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.219
Hang on. Uh, hey, let me
see your service weapon.

06:32.338 --> 06:33.745
Huh? Yeah. Here.

06:33.955 --> 06:36.417
Now, Peru has
the pisco sour, but...

06:36.496 --> 06:37.902
Did you find
Charlotte Vandertunt?

06:37.995 --> 06:39.473
Tell me before, so help me God,

06:39.558 --> 06:42.249
I put a bullet in your
big fat stupid face!

06:42.898 --> 06:45.260
First of all,
that's just hurtful.

06:45.503 --> 06:47.511
And second of all,

06:47.613 --> 06:50.886
it doesn't matter where she is,
just where the ransom money is.

06:50.990 --> 06:53.042
Hmm. Presumably
with the Vandertunts.

06:53.082 --> 06:55.182
So all we gotta do is...

06:55.309 --> 06:57.652
insinuate ourselves
into this whole deal,

06:57.790 --> 06:58.816
like we're there to help,

06:58.884 --> 07:00.824
and steal the ransom
during the exchange.

07:00.943 --> 07:02.303
Yeah. It's a piece of piss.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.987
Now, aren't you glad
you didn't shoot me?

07:04.011 --> 07:05.121
For now.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.153
Although I'm sure at some point

07:06.178 --> 07:07.761
I'll regret that decision, so...

07:07.800 --> 07:09.011
why is there blood
on the barrel?

07:09.035 --> 07:12.610
What? No.
That's, um, hot sauce.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.111
Well, why is there
hot sauce on it?

07:15.182 --> 07:17.041
With a couple of hairs
stuck in it.

07:17.244 --> 07:19.463
- Oh, sweet Christ.
- What?

07:19.524 --> 07:21.049
Did you beat a Guinea
pig to death

07:21.101 --> 07:22.236
with your service weapon,

07:22.292 --> 07:24.557
slather the thing
in hot sauce and eat it?

07:24.682 --> 07:25.839
Yep!

07:26.018 --> 07:27.852
Well, I officially regret
my decision.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.572
Man, I almost always do.

07:34.066 --> 07:37.752
Hey! Who keeps leaving
the Goddamn seat down?

07:37.934 --> 07:40.190
Looking your way, Huizhong.

07:43.304 --> 07:45.767
So, how are we gonna
play this with the Vandertunts?

07:45.792 --> 07:47.993
We're gonna play it that
you keep your fat mouth shut...

07:48.031 --> 07:50.391
- Again, hurtful.
- While I explain to them

07:50.463 --> 07:52.867
that the cavalry
is finally here.

07:52.992 --> 07:55.758
Yes, it's right here,
as per your demand...

07:55.818 --> 07:58.048
a million dollars
in unmarked, untraceable

07:58.132 --> 08:00.109
20, 50,
and 100-dollar bills.

08:00.239 --> 08:01.859
Okay. Good. Good. That's...

08:01.910 --> 08:04.047
<i>sheer idiocy on your part,
frankly.</i>

08:04.120 --> 08:06.148
I'm sorry?
As well you should be.

08:06.258 --> 08:08.086
- <i>What do you...</i>
- I mean, including the bag,

08:08.147 --> 08:09.750
which, by the way, was a gift,

08:09.818 --> 08:12.141
<i>the whole thing must weigh
a good 50 pounds.</i>

08:12.208 --> 08:14.708
- Well, too bad. I...
- I mean, an envelope

08:14.821 --> 08:17.633
with a hundred sammies
would've been so much easier.

08:17.703 --> 08:19.330
- A hundred what?
- <i>Sammies.</i>

08:19.390 --> 08:20.828
After Salmon P. Chase,

08:20.931 --> 08:22.657
the man on the $10,000 bill?

08:22.742 --> 08:24.641
Well, what the hell
am I supposed to do

08:24.667 --> 08:26.328
with a $10,000 bill?

08:26.432 --> 08:28.734
<i>Well, what does one do
with a twenty-dollar bill?</i>

08:28.764 --> 08:30.638
- <i>Buy a single orange?</i>
- That's...

08:30.703 --> 08:32.969
just make sure the money's
at the drop by midnight,

08:33.111 --> 08:35.554
and that you follow
my instructions to the letter.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.573
Mmm, like a reverse scavenger hunt.

08:38.645 --> 08:39.984
And once we have the money,

08:40.063 --> 08:42.059
we'll arrange for the return
of your sister.

08:42.196 --> 08:44.766
<i>Oh, right. Yes. Sorry.
I forgot that part.</i>

08:44.884 --> 08:47.184
- <i>And that's a firm firm?</i>
- Yes.

08:47.209 --> 08:49.686
And no cops, at all, anywhere.

08:49.766 --> 08:51.618
No police.
Also a firm firm?

08:51.724 --> 08:54.891
- <i>Yes, it's a firm firm!
- Wait. Why?</i>

08:55.028 --> 08:56.946
What? I... I don't know.
No reason.

08:57.053 --> 08:59.048
I'm sorry.
This is my first kidnapping.

08:59.169 --> 09:01.766
<i>Well...</i> Or is it?

09:02.579 --> 09:04.008
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

09:04.532 --> 09:06.407
Ciao!
Alrighty, then.

09:06.604 --> 09:08.384
Who's for cuy?

09:11.648 --> 09:12.735
Yes,

09:12.837 --> 09:15.048
that's probably why
you smell burnt hair.

09:15.118 --> 09:16.891
But don't judge them
by their looks.

09:16.979 --> 09:19.179
They may seem appalling...

09:19.571 --> 09:22.227
But trust me,
they're quite delicious.

09:22.488 --> 09:24.766
Yes, delicious.

09:24.899 --> 09:27.165
Like all taboos.

09:27.368 --> 09:29.256
You're frickin' weird.

09:29.423 --> 09:31.751
- I mean, just weird.
- What is?

09:31.790 --> 09:34.204
Lana! Uh, I mean, Miss Kane.

09:34.263 --> 09:36.688
I... I mean, uh...
"Lana" is fine.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.573
- I'll say.
- You'll say what?

09:38.642 --> 09:41.243
- Nothing.
- Ah. A man of mystery.

09:41.382 --> 09:43.813
Well, you know,
mainly in the sense

09:43.885 --> 09:46.345
that I try to solve them,
you know...

09:46.461 --> 09:48.091
- On your own.
- Well, yeah.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.337
I mean, since my partner died.

09:50.416 --> 09:52.972
- Which I actually should really...
- I meant without the police.

09:52.996 --> 09:54.236
Without the who now?

09:54.293 --> 09:56.743
"No cops, at all, anywhere,"

09:56.860 --> 09:58.813
I believe were your exact words.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.899
My exac...
were you eavesdropping on me?

10:00.992 --> 10:02.360
Yes.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.298
Did you have a follow-up
to that, or...

10:04.358 --> 10:06.337
no, actually,
because you caught me

10:06.405 --> 10:08.402
totally off guard
by not denying it.

10:08.544 --> 10:10.446
But how much of that
did you hear?

10:10.476 --> 10:13.276
Depends.
What's your angle, shamus?

10:13.465 --> 10:16.298
Well, uh,
probably about 30 degrees.

10:16.412 --> 10:19.048
Diminishing returns, cliff!

10:19.164 --> 10:21.126
But I'm not working
any angle, so...

10:21.247 --> 10:23.587
So, then, you wouldn't
need any help?

10:23.663 --> 10:26.805
- No, I... why are you so interested?
- No reason.

10:26.962 --> 10:29.985
Just thought maybe you could
make it worth my while.

10:30.066 --> 10:32.009
Well, I... I can't, so...

10:32.091 --> 10:34.579
What if I made it
worth your while?

10:34.732 --> 10:36.399
Umm...

10:37.649 --> 10:38.821
No.

10:38.887 --> 10:41.071
No what? Wait. What?

10:41.180 --> 10:43.063
What? At the club,
I said, "umm,"

10:43.150 --> 10:44.296
and then I was gonna say, "no,"

10:44.320 --> 10:45.820
but then you didn't
let me finish.

10:45.883 --> 10:49.283
- Oh, you finished, all right.
- Yeah. Maybe try woolite?

10:49.342 --> 10:51.376
Which, by the way,
makes one of us!

10:51.435 --> 10:54.459
- Oh, please! Wait. Seriously?
- Get out.

10:54.514 --> 10:56.774
'Cause I'd be happy to,
you know...

10:56.818 --> 11:00.490
- Get......
- St-stay and watch you finish.

11:00.599 --> 11:02.452
- Out!
- Jesus!

11:02.562 --> 11:04.722
Look, if you... ehh!

11:05.991 --> 11:07.772
Great.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.351
Now I have no liquor.

11:09.476 --> 11:12.480
Just a big fat pair
of blue lady-balls.

11:18.105 --> 11:20.465
That's my mouth!

11:20.535 --> 11:22.663
- Get outta here!
- Oh!

11:22.787 --> 11:25.787
If I wanted your
asshole on my mouth,

11:25.845 --> 11:27.199
I'd do it while you were asleep!

11:27.269 --> 11:29.599
Which we've never
talked about, but... ow!

11:29.713 --> 11:32.722
My face!
How long was I out?

11:33.019 --> 11:34.451
Oh, that helps.

11:34.636 --> 11:37.269
Man, I gotta warn Trexler
Dutch wants to kill him.

11:37.393 --> 11:39.910
Mainly because Trexler
hasn't paid me for my work yet,

11:39.965 --> 11:41.425
but... also because...

11:41.479 --> 11:44.965
say what you will about
der robotik ubermenschen.

11:45.302 --> 11:46.910
Sure can punch good.

11:48.246 --> 11:50.074
I'm sorry, darlin',

11:50.239 --> 11:52.097
but you're gonna
have to repeat that.

11:52.237 --> 11:53.363
I said,

11:53.566 --> 11:55.582
"I had a little towel,

11:55.808 --> 11:57.785
"but I lost it walking here,

11:57.875 --> 12:00.769
so I need your clothes,
your boots,

12:00.894 --> 12:01.980
and your motorcycle."

12:02.088 --> 12:04.748
Oh, is that all?

12:04.984 --> 12:06.246
Yeah.
That oughta do it.

12:06.355 --> 12:09.457
You, uh, sure you don't need me
to, uh, check your oil?

12:11.777 --> 12:14.480
Oh, okay.
And by that remark,

12:14.527 --> 12:17.160
I assume you're referring
either to my robotic limbs

12:17.261 --> 12:18.831
or offering to plunge
your finger,

12:18.934 --> 12:20.910
and/or penis, into my anus.

12:21.050 --> 12:23.722
Ohhh! I'll plunge
my fist into your...

12:23.839 --> 12:25.675
Were you gonna say "anus"?

12:26.948 --> 12:28.512
'Cause a finger's one thing.

12:28.693 --> 12:30.465
- But a whole fist?
- Aaahhh!

12:30.652 --> 12:32.105
That's like...

12:32.557 --> 12:34.261
I just never understood that.

12:36.535 --> 12:38.660
And I'm not trying to judge.

12:38.754 --> 12:42.082
But it's like, at some point,
you gotta question your choices.

12:44.596 --> 12:45.996
Whoo!

12:51.563 --> 12:54.496
I don't know. If it's two
consenting adults,

12:54.571 --> 12:56.231
I'm like,
"live and let live."

12:56.302 --> 12:58.302
But if you want me
to let you live, chief,

12:58.402 --> 12:59.613
I'm gonna need those keys.

12:59.707 --> 13:01.910
Here.
Take 'em!

13:02.027 --> 13:03.254
Hey, thanks.

13:03.331 --> 13:05.941
Oh, and if turns out
you lose that arm,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.556
just give me a call.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.533
I got a guy.

13:09.715 --> 13:10.871
He what?

13:10.996 --> 13:13.621
- Uh, is going to kill you.
- Was I not...

13:13.674 --> 13:15.514
<i>what are you talking about?</i>

13:15.683 --> 13:17.004
- <i>Why?</i>
- Stop it!

13:17.089 --> 13:19.004
What, I should be calm
when you tell me

13:19.091 --> 13:21.433
a Goddamn robot
wants to kill me?

13:21.484 --> 13:23.844
<i>No, not you.</i>
Wha... wha... then who?

13:23.963 --> 13:26.699
No. Sorry. You.
He wants to kill you.

13:26.799 --> 13:28.519
The good news is,
without my help,

13:28.578 --> 13:30.608
he'll be dead in...
Ten hours.

13:30.699 --> 13:32.929
<i>Okay, well,
my house is a fortress.</i>

13:33.005 --> 13:35.035
<i>I got a ton of guys.
We'll outlast him.</i>

13:35.141 --> 13:37.311
Yeah. You say that...

13:39.194 --> 13:41.594
Feels pretty good, huh, Dutch?

13:41.700 --> 13:45.910
Yes, it does, other Dutch.
Yes, it does.

13:53.118 --> 13:54.704
Goddamn it.

13:56.387 --> 13:58.269
I think you're confused, doll.

13:58.323 --> 14:00.519
I am not in the least confused!

14:00.631 --> 14:03.081
I don't care if my family
does pay the ransom.

14:03.167 --> 14:04.417
I'm not going back there!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.613
I meant you were confused
about me caring

14:06.638 --> 14:08.230
what you did after the payoff.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.773
You're not planning
to blindfold me

14:09.839 --> 14:10.900
and hide me in a bomb shelter

14:10.924 --> 14:12.961
with limited oxygen
and send my family cryptic notes

14:12.985 --> 14:15.753
about how to find me in a race
against time for my life?

14:16.597 --> 14:19.425
Who are you, collective
pseudonym Carolyn keene?

14:19.566 --> 14:21.844
What? Who would go
to all that trouble?

14:21.917 --> 14:23.667
Johann schmidt,
aka the red skull,

14:23.769 --> 14:25.449
in my Nazi
Kidnap-Slash-Rape fantasy.

14:25.534 --> 14:26.855
Ew!

14:26.985 --> 14:28.644
Right?
Shut up.

14:28.754 --> 14:30.792
Look, tonight your brother
is going to drop

14:30.856 --> 14:33.191
the ransom money
at the Griffith observatory.

14:33.438 --> 14:36.498
Archer is going to retrieve it
and bring it to me.

14:36.691 --> 14:38.355
And if nobody screws up,

14:38.495 --> 14:41.027
once I have the money,
you're free to go.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.941
Well, but that's my whole point.

14:43.204 --> 14:45.894
Go where?

14:46.467 --> 14:48.152
Who knows? Maybe a handsome

14:48.208 --> 14:50.714
young Nazi scientist will take you in.

14:50.809 --> 14:53.909
- Do what now?
- What the hell are you doing?

14:53.979 --> 14:55.574
Just filling
the coolers with ice.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.674
You know,
normal bartendery stuff.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.855
Oh, so suddenly

14:59.880 --> 15:01.150
you work here again? - I...

15:01.298 --> 15:03.136
- What happened to your face?
- I...

15:03.192 --> 15:05.218
Did someone catch you snooping?

15:05.245 --> 15:08.831
Uh, no, I walked into a door...
Repeatedly.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.933
Oh, yeah.
My mother used to do that.

15:10.980 --> 15:11.980
Well, you better not have been

15:12.044 --> 15:13.574
snooping on me, mister.

15:13.665 --> 15:17.292
Are you... pfft! Come on!
I wouldn't do that!

15:17.449 --> 15:21.189
So, Archer's the
bagman for a kidnapping, huh?

15:21.410 --> 15:23.331
Okay, then.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.722
Because you know
what happens to snoops.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.597
- They get... poops?
- What?

15:29.719 --> 15:31.449
It's just that the kidnappers

15:31.516 --> 15:34.644
were extremely clear
on that point.

15:35.022 --> 15:37.011
No police, at all, anywhere.

15:37.127 --> 15:39.627
Well, of course they're gonna
say that, but trust me...

15:39.700 --> 15:41.933
I trust him.
He brought me a finger.

15:43.238 --> 15:45.472
Only you. What?

15:45.597 --> 15:48.566
All I had today was some cuy.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.105
Oh, and congee.

15:50.268 --> 15:52.503
Oh, and a bunch
of salted duck eggs.

15:52.671 --> 15:54.699
Look, we'll be right behind you,

15:54.840 --> 15:56.464
so just follow
their instructions,

15:56.541 --> 15:58.541
drop the ransom off,
and with a bit of luck,

15:58.581 --> 16:00.402
we'll get it and the kidnappers.

16:00.495 --> 16:04.292
Okay, but I have a bad feeling about this.

16:04.382 --> 16:06.019
Well, I don't care.

16:06.142 --> 16:08.964
Hmm. Fair enough.

16:11.689 --> 16:14.558
Do you wanna go?

16:17.096 --> 16:19.111
I thought I made it
pretty clear to the little weirdo

16:19.158 --> 16:21.605
that I didn't wanna see any cops
near the drop.

16:21.738 --> 16:23.941
I guess you can't
blame the guy for trying.

16:24.102 --> 16:27.027
Plus, it's not like I can't
handle Figgis and Poovey.

16:27.159 --> 16:29.238
But I may have to wait them out.

16:29.310 --> 16:31.417
Whatever.
You paid for an hour.

16:31.576 --> 16:32.806
Well, that's my whole point.

16:32.878 --> 16:34.644
It may take a lot longer
than an hour...

16:34.703 --> 16:36.613
well... and I'm not
paying you any extra.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.134
- What?
- But feel free to hike the five miles

16:39.277 --> 16:41.117
back to sunset in those heels.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.159
What the hell?
Who brings a hooker?

16:50.961 --> 16:53.961
Okay. Here's the topiary
garden.

16:54.002 --> 16:57.034
Which I wish I could buy it so
I could burn it to the ground.

16:57.164 --> 16:59.722
Topiary.
My God, what rubbish.

16:59.878 --> 17:01.307
Shrubbish!

17:02.409 --> 17:04.683
- So freakin' weird.
- Hmm.

17:04.933 --> 17:07.261
Well, I suppose
that looks like a mushroom.

17:07.345 --> 17:09.988
What? It's clearly
a mushroom.

17:10.182 --> 17:11.642
Well, then...

17:12.730 --> 17:15.080
All right, then. I'm off.

17:15.200 --> 17:20.430
Alone, as I arrived,
with no police anywhere!

17:20.525 --> 17:21.605
I mean...

17:21.630 --> 17:22.730
Seriously.

17:22.794 --> 17:25.954
Okay, Archer.
It's your move.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.034
Damn it.
I gotta at least tip her.

17:28.058 --> 17:30.178
This is definitely gonna take
longer than an hour.

17:30.202 --> 17:31.842
Man, I wish I had a...

17:32.684 --> 17:34.454
Smoke grenade?
What the shit?

17:35.581 --> 17:37.466
Goddamn it!

17:37.475 --> 17:38.720
Will you come on?

17:38.810 --> 17:40.626
No, no, no, no, no, no!

17:40.879 --> 17:43.064
God... Damn it!

17:44.364 --> 17:46.988
I guess it's not his move.

17:47.953 --> 17:50.051
Jesus!

17:50.155 --> 17:51.699
Sorry. Here. Take these.

17:51.790 --> 17:53.190
What the hell are these for?

17:53.215 --> 17:54.829
Um, I guess, parting gifts?

17:54.988 --> 17:57.207
What? I don't know. Maybe you
can sell 'em or whatever.

17:57.311 --> 18:00.121
Because, listen, this car chase
is gonna get a little crazy...

18:00.193 --> 18:02.413
well, then, let me out!
Stop the car!

18:02.571 --> 18:04.410
Let me finish!
Because my point is,

18:04.538 --> 18:05.842
I don't really
have time to stop.

18:05.897 --> 18:08.006
But I'm not gonna have that,

18:08.109 --> 18:09.625
so I'm gonna need you
to kind of jump out.

18:09.649 --> 18:12.213
Are you nuts? I'll slow
down a little, obviously,

18:12.300 --> 18:14.207
but when you hit the
ground,

18:14.314 --> 18:15.883
You're gonna wanna kind of roll.

18:17.374 --> 18:20.398
Yeah, just like that!
Good instincts!

18:20.485 --> 18:24.207
Asshole!

18:24.567 --> 18:26.027
Seriously!

18:26.258 --> 18:27.978
They're gaining on us!
Step on it!

18:28.074 --> 18:30.356
Trust me,
it's totally stepped on!

18:30.527 --> 18:32.323
Oh, son of a...

18:32.449 --> 18:33.634
Oh, shit.

18:35.655 --> 18:39.791
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

18:41.959 --> 18:43.726
Goddamn it.

18:43.842 --> 18:45.022
Did ya get 'em?

18:45.156 --> 18:46.796
No. I got somebody, though.

18:46.884 --> 18:49.007
Wow. Good policin'.

18:49.085 --> 18:50.811
Shut up.

19:01.338 --> 19:02.674
Son of a...

19:02.765 --> 19:04.635
No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:11.966 --> 19:14.310
Oh, Goddamn it.

19:18.108 --> 19:19.908
So...

19:21.014 --> 19:22.880
How was your evening?

19:24.310 --> 19:26.482
Uh, not g-great.

19:30.155 --> 19:33.543
And I assume about to get worse.
