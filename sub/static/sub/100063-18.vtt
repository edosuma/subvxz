WEBVTT

00:11.370 --> 00:13.405
Magnum!

00:14.718 --> 00:16.863
Magnum!

00:16.887 --> 00:18.765
Magnum, I can literally hear this music

00:18.789 --> 00:19.966
all the way from the study!

00:19.990 --> 00:20.967
Oh, my God.

00:20.991 --> 00:22.568
Hey, Higgins.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.937
Jin, are you kidding me?

00:26.149 --> 00:28.107
What? Are you shocked
that I'm crashing with Magnum

00:28.131 --> 00:29.938
or that I'm really good at billiards?

00:29.962 --> 00:32.517
Uh, I'm shocked that
you're running around naked.

00:32.540 --> 00:35.782
I thought Europeans were cool
about this kind of thing.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.884
Oh, I get it.

00:37.908 --> 00:39.652
The temptation's too strong.

00:39.676 --> 00:42.155
- It's all about controlling your urges.
- Jin,

00:42.179 --> 00:44.330
it is about having the common
courtesy to wear clothes

00:44.354 --> 00:45.989
when you're a guest in somebody's home.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.327
Yeah. All right.

00:47.351 --> 00:48.830
That makes sense. My bad.

00:48.854 --> 00:50.933
Okay, great. Would you just go
and cover up, please?

00:50.957 --> 00:52.734
I can't. Today is laundry day.

00:52.758 --> 00:55.437
Literally everything that I own
is being washed right now.

00:55.461 --> 00:56.672
How long have you even been here?

00:56.696 --> 00:57.873
Couple of days.

00:57.897 --> 01:00.275
Oh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

01:00.299 --> 01:02.244
I always saw you and Magnum together.

01:02.268 --> 01:04.179
All right, Jin,
we're not together, as you know.

01:04.203 --> 01:05.212
I'm sure Magnum explained that this is

01:05.236 --> 01:07.683
just a-a, a business arrangement.

01:07.707 --> 01:09.685
Right. It's about the green card.

01:09.709 --> 01:10.686
You should've called me, by the way.

01:10.710 --> 01:11.787
I could've hooked you up.

01:11.811 --> 01:12.854
Jin, we wanted to do this legally.

01:12.878 --> 01:14.323
All right?

01:14.347 --> 01:15.891
It's about staying <i>in</i> the country

01:15.915 --> 01:17.392
and out of prison.

01:17.416 --> 01:18.593
"Legally."

01:18.617 --> 01:20.862
I hate to break it to you, future Mrs. M,

01:20.886 --> 01:22.420
but you're still committing a crime.

01:23.014 --> 01:24.566
I... Oh, my God.

01:24.590 --> 01:25.667
No, it's...

01:25.691 --> 01:27.235
You're the one committing a crime.

01:27.259 --> 01:29.237
Mr. Masters spent $20,000
on that pool table

01:29.261 --> 01:30.514
that you are currently mounting.

01:30.538 --> 01:31.908
Would you just please

01:31.932 --> 01:33.108
get off it?

01:33.132 --> 01:34.643
Right after this shot.

01:34.667 --> 01:35.877
Where is Magnum, anyway?

01:35.901 --> 01:38.847
Out. Something
about the upcoming nuptials.

01:43.776 --> 01:44.953
All right!

01:44.977 --> 01:46.722
Whoa!

01:46.746 --> 01:47.789
Check this guy out.

01:47.813 --> 01:49.791
Magnum. Thomas Magnum.

01:50.983 --> 01:52.294
Looking sharp, TM.

01:52.318 --> 01:53.595
It's pretty nice, right?

01:53.619 --> 01:54.830
Fits like a glove, bruddah.

01:54.854 --> 01:57.232
Give me a sec, fellas.

01:57.256 --> 01:59.092
It's my fiancée.

01:59.992 --> 02:01.236
Hey, Higgy.

02:01.260 --> 02:03.122
Where are you?
Our client meeting in Wahiawa

02:03.146 --> 02:05.455
is in 30 minutes, and the traffic is bad.

02:05.479 --> 02:07.234
Oh, yeah. No, I'm getting fitted
for a tux right now.

02:07.258 --> 02:08.374
You know you can just wear

02:08.398 --> 02:09.745
- a normal suit for this, right?
- Yeah,

02:09.769 --> 02:11.246
but the more legit it looks,
the more likely

02:11.270 --> 02:12.780
they're gonna rubber-stamp
your green card.

02:12.804 --> 02:14.583
Yeah, I know. I just...

02:14.607 --> 02:16.693
You're really putting yourself
out for this.

02:16.717 --> 02:18.420
No, no. Actually, Kamekona's buddy

02:18.444 --> 02:19.955
is hooking me up with a tux.

02:19.979 --> 02:21.490
Okay. I just...

02:21.514 --> 02:22.858
I don't want to be a burden.

02:22.882 --> 02:25.243
Listen, we really are running late.

02:25.267 --> 02:26.428
It's best if we meet there.

02:26.452 --> 02:28.864
It's Wahiawa Elementary School.
I'll text you the address.

02:28.888 --> 02:30.432
Okay.

02:30.456 --> 02:31.600
I got to go, guys.

02:31.624 --> 02:32.601
Us, too.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.669
Yeah. Hey. Don't forget.

02:34.693 --> 02:35.971
Bachelor party. 9:00 p.m.

02:35.995 --> 02:37.996
Kammy, Shammy.

02:39.031 --> 02:40.609
<i>I got to say,</i>

02:40.633 --> 02:42.444
<i>when I brought up
the marriage plan to Higgins,</i>

02:42.468 --> 02:44.200
<i>I was just trying to help a friend.</i>

02:44.224 --> 02:46.246
<i>But now I'm actually kind of excited.</i>

02:46.270 --> 02:47.949
<i>Before he died, my dad told me</i>

02:47.973 --> 02:50.485
<i>two of the most important
things a man leaves behind</i>

02:50.509 --> 02:52.410
<i>are his friends and his family.</i>

02:52.813 --> 02:54.081
<i>Doing this...</i>

02:54.105 --> 02:55.642
<i>marrying Higgins...</i>

02:55.666 --> 02:58.000
<i>keeps my friends and my family together.</i>

03:01.261 --> 03:02.831
Better not be this late to the altar.

03:02.855 --> 03:03.899
I wouldn't dare.

03:03.923 --> 03:06.333
Come on. I'll introduce you
to Principal Mahelona.

03:06.357 --> 03:07.636
You pick your bridesmaids yet?

03:07.660 --> 03:10.043
Yes. Kumu has actually agreed
to be my maid of honor.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.206
Obviously.

03:11.230 --> 03:13.125
And I've asked Noelani to
be a bridesmaid as well.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.510
Other than that, I don't know
too many women on the island,

03:15.534 --> 03:17.546
so I was thinking about
asking Tani and Quinn.

03:17.570 --> 03:19.881
Quinn? Score for Rick.

03:20.906 --> 03:22.046
Kumu.

03:22.070 --> 03:25.020
Ah. Makani. Oh.

03:25.044 --> 03:27.089
This is Thomas and Juliet.

03:27.113 --> 03:28.757
- Thank you for coming all this way.
- Hi.

03:28.781 --> 03:30.992
Oh, yeah. Don't mention it.
Anything for a friend of Kumu's.

03:31.016 --> 03:32.994
Please take a seat.

03:33.018 --> 03:35.328
So,

03:35.352 --> 03:37.365
how can we help you?

03:37.389 --> 03:39.034
For as long as I've been here,

03:39.058 --> 03:40.435
the school has been underfunded.

03:40.459 --> 03:42.294
But for the past 18 months,

03:42.318 --> 03:43.939
we've been blessed with a benefactor.

03:43.963 --> 03:45.674
They've donated school supplies,

03:45.698 --> 03:47.909
gym equipment, even computers.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.179
That's very generous.

03:49.203 --> 03:50.765
It's made a profound difference.

03:50.789 --> 03:52.226
The crazy thing is,

03:52.250 --> 03:54.049
we have no idea who this person is.

03:54.073 --> 03:55.673
How is that?

03:55.697 --> 03:58.108
Well, when the first gift arrived,
it came with instructions

03:58.132 --> 04:01.368
to use a suggestion box that is
to be left outside the building.

04:01.392 --> 04:03.558
All we had to do
was put a note in the box.

04:03.582 --> 04:07.093
Any items we asked for magically
appeared in a few days.

04:07.117 --> 04:09.064
They must have been dropped off
in the middle of the night.

04:09.088 --> 04:11.133
Kind of like writing to Santa.

04:11.157 --> 04:13.034
Yes. And their only request

04:13.058 --> 04:14.993
was they wished to remain anonymous.

04:15.017 --> 04:17.539
So we never publicized the donations

04:17.563 --> 04:19.040
or tried to learn who was behind them.

04:19.064 --> 04:21.642
But now we need to know.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.011
And why is that?

04:23.035 --> 04:25.080
Because I'm worried
something's happened to them.

04:25.104 --> 04:26.704
If you don't know who it is,

04:27.365 --> 04:28.884
how could you know that?

04:28.908 --> 04:30.752
Normally, when a note is left in the box,

04:30.776 --> 04:32.186
it's gone the next day.

04:33.479 --> 04:34.823
Five days ago, I left a note

04:34.847 --> 04:36.414
in the box, and it's still there.

04:37.483 --> 04:40.061
I really feel like something's wrong.

04:40.085 --> 04:41.496
Well, there are plenty of reasons

04:41.520 --> 04:43.440
why that note
might not have been picked up.

04:43.865 --> 04:47.025
We teach caring and compassion
here, as well as academics.

04:47.577 --> 04:49.504
I tell our students
that one act of kindness

04:49.528 --> 04:50.754
leads to another

04:50.778 --> 04:52.597
and another and another.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.976
Whoever this person is,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.912
they're a guardian angel to our school.

04:56.936 --> 04:59.404
I just need to know that they're okay.

05:02.925 --> 05:05.654
Well, we'd be happy
to, uh, take the case.

05:06.261 --> 05:08.046
Hmm. Mahalo.

05:08.981 --> 05:10.625
Now, about your rate...

05:10.649 --> 05:11.693
No, no, no. There's no need

05:11.717 --> 05:13.595
to discuss that. Um, we're happy to do it

05:13.619 --> 05:14.697
pro bono.

05:14.721 --> 05:16.998
Kumu, I told you
I didn't want any special favors

05:17.022 --> 05:18.767
on account of our friendship.

05:18.791 --> 05:19.968
I don't think that's it.

05:19.992 --> 05:21.937
Listen, you said it yourself.

05:21.961 --> 05:24.105
One act of kindness leads to another.

05:24.739 --> 05:26.199
We can't take your money.

05:27.325 --> 05:29.044
Mahalo.

05:29.068 --> 05:31.947
Okay. I'm gonna stay and go
through the security footage.

05:31.971 --> 05:33.481
It's a good thing
we're doing this pro bono.

05:33.505 --> 05:35.784
It's one of those cases
that could drag on forever.

05:35.808 --> 05:36.718
That happens?

05:36.742 --> 05:37.953
Yeah. Clients end up burning

05:37.977 --> 05:39.221
through a lot of cash because it's

05:39.245 --> 05:40.889
practically impossible to solve.

05:40.913 --> 05:42.724
But this is basically
a missing persons case,

05:42.748 --> 05:44.459
and we've handled plenty of those before.

05:44.483 --> 05:45.727
Yeah, but this time we don't even know

05:45.751 --> 05:47.229
who the missing person is.

05:47.253 --> 05:55.253

06:10.945 --> 06:12.734
Attention, everybody!

06:12.758 --> 06:16.157
Attention! I need everybody's
attention in the bar, please.

06:16.181 --> 06:17.441
That includes you in the back!

06:17.465 --> 06:18.994
Listen up!

06:19.018 --> 06:23.665
Today, we have the honor
to have a true American hero

06:23.689 --> 06:25.667
in our presence.

06:25.691 --> 06:28.837
Master Gunnery Sergeant Sean Murphy,

06:28.861 --> 06:32.507
whose career with the U.S. Marines ends

06:32.531 --> 06:34.709
after 30 years of service.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.544
Can you believe it? Huh?

06:36.568 --> 06:39.014
Can you believe it?

06:39.038 --> 06:41.850
In that time, Murph has saved lives,

06:41.874 --> 06:44.726
defended freedom, and protected
this great nation of ours.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.288
Everybody raise up your glasses.

06:46.312 --> 06:47.922
To Murph.

06:47.946 --> 06:48.923
Welcome to paradise.

06:48.947 --> 06:50.225
Love you, pal.

06:50.249 --> 06:52.060
- Yeah, Murph!
- You.

06:52.084 --> 06:53.628
- Oorah!
- Oorah!

06:54.987 --> 06:57.065
- Was that really necessary? Huh?
- Oh. Come on.

06:57.089 --> 06:58.300
Don't be embarrassed.

06:58.324 --> 07:01.297
I meant every word of it,
too, pal, all right?

07:01.321 --> 07:03.038
- So, it's real, man.
- Yeah.

07:03.062 --> 07:04.873
You're taking off your boots for good.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.074
How do you feel?

07:06.098 --> 07:07.976
I can't believe it's over.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.292
I'm gonna miss it.

07:09.316 --> 07:10.539
But I got to say

07:10.563 --> 07:12.213
I'm kind of excited
about starting a new life.

07:12.237 --> 07:14.049
And what better place than here?

07:14.073 --> 07:16.051
Hey, listen, you ready for that
interview I lined up for you?

07:16.075 --> 07:17.919
Orville, relax.

07:17.943 --> 07:20.155
The man's been here a day and a half.

07:20.179 --> 07:22.891
I thought taking off his
uniform meant taking it easy.

07:22.915 --> 07:25.060
Hey. Taking it easy's
not my thing, all right?

07:25.084 --> 07:27.729
Yeah, listen,
my buddy Ronnie runs a shipping dock.

07:27.753 --> 07:29.731
He's looking for a few new security guys.

07:29.755 --> 07:31.266
- Sounds like a dream gig.
- Yeah.

07:31.290 --> 07:32.934
After executing raids downrange,

07:32.958 --> 07:35.603
I think I can handle
protecting a dock, right?

07:35.627 --> 07:36.671
Piece of cake.

07:36.695 --> 07:38.773
Hey, look, for real, guys,

07:38.797 --> 07:41.176
I'm glad it's you two that
are helping me make the move.

07:41.927 --> 07:42.962
I love you guys.

07:42.987 --> 07:44.121
We love you, man.

07:44.809 --> 07:46.687
- Glad you're here, Murph.
- Hey.

07:46.872 --> 07:47.912
Glad you're here.

07:49.775 --> 07:52.087
I can't thank you
enough for helping Makani.

07:52.111 --> 07:54.956
Of course. Someone like her deserves it.

07:54.980 --> 07:56.958
She's always been a good person.

07:56.982 --> 07:58.960
Went to college on the mainland.

07:58.984 --> 08:01.262
Could have done anything
but came back here to teach.

08:01.286 --> 08:03.865
A few years ago,
she took over the school.

08:03.889 --> 08:05.200
Done wonders with the place.

08:05.224 --> 08:07.936
- Hey. Any updates?
- No.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.772
I'm just taking another partial print

08:10.796 --> 08:11.773
and running it now.

08:11.797 --> 08:13.176
- You?
- Yes, actually.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.168
A couple months ago,
the benefactor donated

08:15.193 --> 08:16.978
15 monitors to the school.

08:17.002 --> 08:19.814
I found a SKU on the back of one
of the boxes, traced it back

08:19.838 --> 08:22.183
to a Home Buy 21 store in Kapolei.

08:22.207 --> 08:24.285
The manager's checking to see
if they can locate the buyer.

08:26.879 --> 08:28.722
- Anything?
- Unfortunately not. No.

08:30.015 --> 08:32.304
Oh. Might not matter.
This is the, uh, manager now.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.294
Hello.

08:33.318 --> 08:34.636
Yes.

08:37.006 --> 08:38.107
Are you sure?

08:39.323 --> 08:40.635
Okay.

08:40.659 --> 08:41.703
Thank you.

08:42.124 --> 08:43.500
What is it?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.806
Well, according to the manager,

08:44.830 --> 08:46.764
those monitors were stolen.

08:47.558 --> 08:50.004
So the benefactor donated stolen goods?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.239
Yeah.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.766
Seems as though
our missing person is a thief.

09:02.992 --> 09:04.228
Is that my aloha shirt?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.499
Correction... it's our shirt.

09:05.523 --> 09:06.696
I didn't think you'd mind.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.026
Yeah, I do mind.

09:08.050 --> 09:09.900
- Okay, I'll just take it off, then.
- No, no, no,

09:09.924 --> 09:11.335
no, no. Your naked image

09:11.359 --> 09:14.261
is already burned into my retina
forever, thank you very much.

09:15.930 --> 09:16.948
Don't ask.

09:16.972 --> 09:19.009
- So, should I change or not? I...
- No, no, no.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.644
We have more pressing matters.

09:20.668 --> 09:22.785
Ooh. Yummy. I love police reports.

09:22.809 --> 09:25.249
We need you to look at the report
and see if you recognize the M.O.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.532
Okay. For my expertise

09:26.556 --> 09:28.485
to be most effective, I need context.

09:28.509 --> 09:32.489
Okay. So, a bunch of items
were anonymously donated

09:32.513 --> 09:34.258
to Wahiawa Elementary School.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.694
We traced the serial numbers
back to several big chain stores

09:36.718 --> 09:37.695
on the island.

09:37.719 --> 09:39.230
All of the items were stolen.

09:39.254 --> 09:40.531
So we were wondering

09:40.555 --> 09:42.333
if you could maybe help
us identify the thief.

09:42.357 --> 09:44.668
Hang on. Wait,
someone did all the legwork,

09:44.692 --> 09:46.737
risked their freedom, got away with it,

09:46.761 --> 09:48.675
and then just gave all the stuff away?

09:48.699 --> 09:50.608
Yeah. Kind of like
a modern-day Robin Hood.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.209
More like a modern-day idiot.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.445
As a former thief, I'm deeply offended.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.614
Jin, the reports.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.015
Okay. Sorry, roomie.

09:58.039 --> 09:59.283
- Please don't call me that.
- Oh, yeah.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.941
That's reserved for the little missus.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.095
Anyway, um,

10:03.119 --> 10:04.388
okay.

10:04.412 --> 10:06.245
Hmm. Huh.

10:06.269 --> 10:08.459
Well, our Robin Hood
is definitely working alone.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.027
How could you possibly know that?

10:10.051 --> 10:11.395
Well, check it out.

10:11.419 --> 10:12.630
The security alarms were turned off

10:12.654 --> 10:14.962
three minutes before the
cameras went off-line.

10:14.986 --> 10:17.768
So he did one thing
and then another thing.

10:17.792 --> 10:20.372
A crew would have done it simultaneously.

10:20.396 --> 10:22.973
- Hmm.
- He's definitely stealing in bulk.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.476
There's no way he's putting all
that merch inside his pocket.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.178
He needs a truck or a van.

10:28.202 --> 10:30.648
Uh, unless they're stealing
a new car for every score,

10:30.672 --> 10:32.650
they're definitely using
the same vehicle every time.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.989
Well, we do know the deliveries
happened at night,

10:35.013 --> 10:36.413
and we do know
which nights they happened.

10:36.437 --> 10:39.123
So we just need to check the security
cameras surrounding the school and see

10:39.147 --> 10:40.291
if the same van or truck

10:40.315 --> 10:42.393
pops up on each of the delivery nights.

10:42.417 --> 10:45.177
Yeah, but there's not a lot of
homes or businesses in the area.

10:45.201 --> 10:47.498
There are traffic cams. You know
what? I'm gonna text Rick.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.301
He knows a guy at the Department
of Transportation who can help.

10:50.325 --> 10:53.404
I wonder why the thief chose
Wahiawa Elementary School.

10:53.428 --> 10:55.506
I mean, plenty of schools
are not doing so well.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.112
Maybe there's a connection
with the school.

10:57.136 --> 10:59.129
You know how you give to an alma mater?

10:59.153 --> 11:00.644
You know, I gave money to Dickinson.

11:00.668 --> 11:02.579
- That was your high school?
- No, Squirrel Dickinson.

11:02.603 --> 11:04.481
He was my mentor. He was a legend.

11:04.505 --> 11:05.683
You don't know about him?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.351
He taught me everything I know.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.875
He was my alma mater,
and I wanted to give back,

11:09.899 --> 11:11.588
so I gave money to the Squirrel's

11:11.612 --> 11:15.259
prison canteen account
every month when he got busted.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.527
Oddly enough,

11:16.551 --> 11:18.295
your theory actually kind of makes sense.

11:18.319 --> 11:20.331
We still just need to identify the thief

11:20.355 --> 11:22.099
and notify HPD.

11:22.123 --> 11:24.702
Yes, we need to identify our Robin Hood

11:24.726 --> 11:26.770
and make sure they're safe.

11:26.794 --> 11:27.838
That is the job.

11:27.862 --> 11:29.182
Yeah, I know what the job is, Magnum,

11:29.206 --> 11:31.375
but our missing person
is breaking the law.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.066
They're stealing
from a massive corporation,

11:33.090 --> 11:34.390
who I'm sure is insured,

11:34.414 --> 11:36.714
and delivering these goods
to underprivileged children.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.081
Magnum, it's still illegal
and, therefore, wrong.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.718
Look, without his help,
these schools probably

11:40.742 --> 11:41.719
would've shut down.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.721
I-In my opinion, this guy is a hero.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.323
Uh, we can't turn him into the cops.

11:49.254 --> 11:51.460
_

11:52.253 --> 11:54.565
I forgot. I have to, uh,

11:54.589 --> 11:56.066
attend to something.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.135
I'm gonna meet you later, okay?

11:58.159 --> 11:59.206
Okay.

12:00.134 --> 12:01.372
Whoa.

12:01.396 --> 12:02.806
That was weird.

12:02.830 --> 12:04.375
Maybe she's cheating on you already.

12:11.176 --> 12:12.316
Gordon.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.318
Everything all right?

12:14.846 --> 12:16.166
I heard about the wedding.

12:16.190 --> 12:18.225
- How did you...?
- Rick mentioned it.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.853
Look, it's none
of my business, but, uh...

12:23.284 --> 12:25.763
...but getting married
for a green card is a bad idea.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.266
And you and Magnum doing it, even worse.

12:29.778 --> 12:31.268
What makes you say that?

12:31.292 --> 12:33.337
Because you work together.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.372
And because the immigration
people aren't dumb.

12:36.535 --> 12:39.093
They'll ask your clients
if you act like a couple.

12:39.117 --> 12:42.413
Those clients will say no
unless you maintain the lie.

12:42.437 --> 12:43.714
And since you're always together,

12:43.738 --> 12:45.682
that means keeping it up constantly.

12:45.961 --> 12:48.585
With your history undercover,
you know how hard that is.

12:49.089 --> 12:50.340
I do.

12:51.212 --> 12:53.313
If you get caught, and you will...

12:54.382 --> 12:57.361
...the penalty's severe.
You'll both be arrested.

12:57.385 --> 13:00.267
You'll get deported and
Magnum will lose his license.

13:00.788 --> 13:02.392
As a cop, I wish
I didn't know any of this.

13:02.416 --> 13:06.437
But as a friend, I don't want
to see you guys get in trouble.

13:06.461 --> 13:10.941
And by... fake-marrying
your business partner,

13:11.695 --> 13:13.533
you're headed down that road.

13:16.950 --> 13:18.482
Can I ask...

13:18.827 --> 13:22.219
why you wanted to talk
to me about this alone?

13:22.243 --> 13:23.921
I respect the hell out of Magnum

13:23.945 --> 13:25.589
for stepping up to keep you here.

13:25.613 --> 13:27.391
His heart's in the right place.

13:27.753 --> 13:29.560
But in typical Magnum fashion,

13:29.584 --> 13:32.152
I'm pretty sure
he didn't think it through.

13:33.988 --> 13:35.802
You tend to have a more...

13:36.671 --> 13:38.705
reasoned approach to things.

13:42.296 --> 13:43.774
Thanks for your concern, Gordie.

13:43.798 --> 13:45.499
I... I appreciate it.

13:54.154 --> 13:55.452
We got a couple hours

13:55.476 --> 13:56.420
before the interview.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.588
Do you want to prep?

13:57.612 --> 13:58.856
Come on, man, huh?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.291
- I'm not a kid. I got this.
- Okay.

14:02.059 --> 14:03.460
You know what you're gonna say?

14:03.484 --> 14:05.496
You ever even had a job interview?

14:05.520 --> 14:08.257
No. High school I worked
my old man's garage.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.500
Then I enlisted.

14:09.524 --> 14:11.635
All right. Look...

14:11.659 --> 14:14.438
Murph, y-your experience
in the Marines...

14:14.462 --> 14:17.608
it-it's gonna make
this security gig a no-brainer.

14:17.632 --> 14:19.209
Right? Easy.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.577
But you got to land the job first.

14:20.601 --> 14:23.347
That means you got to go in
and talk to Ronnie, the boss,

14:23.371 --> 14:25.315
and convince him
that you really want the job

14:25.339 --> 14:28.000
and you're the best man
for the job, right?

14:28.024 --> 14:29.353
Now, did you bring your résumé?

14:30.411 --> 14:31.622
You forgot the résumé?

14:31.646 --> 14:33.290
Come on, give me a break, huh?

14:33.314 --> 14:35.392
For 30 years I wore my résumé.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.394
Listen, service doesn't always
translate the best

14:37.418 --> 14:38.562
in the civilian world.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.364
Trust me. I had to learn the hard way.

14:40.388 --> 14:42.733
Look, I'll wing it. I'm gonna be fine.

14:43.286 --> 14:45.302
Murph, Murph, just stop for a second.

14:45.326 --> 14:46.737
Murph, listen to me, man.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.338
In the Corps,

14:48.362 --> 14:50.741
everything was laid out for us, right?

14:50.765 --> 14:53.744
They told you where you had
to be, what you had to do.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.413
But when you get out,
you got to start all over again.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.848
You know, you got to make up your own

14:57.872 --> 15:00.417
structure, your own schedule,
your own life.

15:01.388 --> 15:03.253
Now, listen, when I got out,

15:03.277 --> 15:05.355
if Robin Masters hadn't pulled
the strings that he did

15:05.379 --> 15:07.024
for me to get me
that job managing the club,

15:07.048 --> 15:08.659
I'd-I'd still be sitting
in the parking lot

15:08.683 --> 15:10.861
of the ABC Store staring off into space.

15:10.885 --> 15:12.073
All right, so what's your point?

15:12.097 --> 15:13.743
I'm trying to pay it forward.

15:13.767 --> 15:17.434
I'm trying to do for you
what Robin Masters did for me.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.702
Now, listen, I-I know you're used

15:18.726 --> 15:20.270
to giving orders your whole life,

15:20.294 --> 15:22.439
but right now I need you to take one.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.542
I need you to go in there,
interview for that job,

15:25.566 --> 15:27.744
with the résumé, like any normal civvy.

15:28.081 --> 15:29.279
You got it?

15:30.125 --> 15:31.381
I got it.

15:31.405 --> 15:32.382
You got it?

15:32.961 --> 15:33.951
I got it.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.619
I'm gonna go back to the motel,

15:35.643 --> 15:37.218
I'm gonna get my résumé together,

15:37.242 --> 15:39.356
I'm gonna be my normal charming self,

15:39.380 --> 15:40.424
and I'm gonna get that job.

15:40.448 --> 15:41.758
All right. Well, come back here.

15:41.782 --> 15:43.131
We'll have a drink to celebrate.

15:43.155 --> 15:44.628
All right? Love you, pal.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.862
Go get that gig.

15:45.886 --> 15:47.364
- Yeah.
- Go get it.

15:47.388 --> 15:49.099
I don't understand. What is this?

15:49.123 --> 15:50.467
You're joking, bruddah.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.969
It's the cake topper.

15:53.023 --> 15:55.113
And the bride looks just like Higgins.

15:55.137 --> 15:57.268
Yeah, but the groom
looks nothing like me.

15:57.292 --> 15:58.408
He's got blond hair.

15:59.070 --> 16:00.433
Oh, yeah?

16:07.642 --> 16:09.453
There you go.

16:10.123 --> 16:11.876
Afternoon, gents.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.466
Nice cake topper. Is that...?

16:13.490 --> 16:14.932
For us? Yeah.

16:14.956 --> 16:17.594
Kamekona offered to bake us
a wedding cake, free of charge.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.731
That's very generous of you. Thank you.

16:20.755 --> 16:22.989
Did you get the traffic cam footage?

16:27.995 --> 16:30.185
Magnum, has it occurred to you

16:30.631 --> 16:33.343
that our... partnership

16:33.367 --> 16:36.086
might affect the success
of... of this marriage?

16:36.650 --> 16:38.682
No, 'cause it's not a real marriage.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.217
No, I know that. I mean,

16:40.241 --> 16:43.453
perhaps the ruse will become too
much of a challenge to keep up.

16:43.477 --> 16:45.155
Ruses are our bread and butter.

16:45.525 --> 16:47.026
We got this.

16:50.420 --> 16:51.468
There it is.

16:51.493 --> 16:53.638
Same truck from the night
of the last delivery.

16:53.663 --> 16:55.060
Okay. Fast-forward to the next one.

16:56.878 --> 16:58.259
There it is again.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.506
Right.

17:02.343 --> 17:04.354
Truck is registered to one Kalohe Olu.

17:04.378 --> 17:05.913
She could be our Robin Hood.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.656
Looks like five days' worth.

18:06.026 --> 18:08.762
Coffee grounds, but no coffee maker.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.515
Find something?

18:18.539 --> 18:19.783
It's the notes Principal Mahelona

18:19.807 --> 18:21.885
left in the suggestion box.

18:21.909 --> 18:23.954
So Kalohe <i>is</i> our Robin Hood?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.122
Yeah.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.885
Now we just need to find her.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.727
- You catch that car?
- Yeah.

18:30.751 --> 18:32.896
- Looks like they're watching the house.
- They don't look

18:32.920 --> 18:35.488
- like law enforcement.
- Hmm.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.173
Sorry to bother you,
but who are you gentlemen?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.085
Gun!

19:19.147 --> 19:22.650
Kalohe? Are you sure?

19:22.717 --> 19:24.094
We found proof at her home.

19:24.118 --> 19:25.362
I take it you know her?

19:25.386 --> 19:26.964
I was her teacher years ago.

19:26.988 --> 19:28.198
What can you tell us about her?

19:28.791 --> 19:30.467
Her family life was difficult.

19:30.491 --> 19:32.102
Her father was a thief, in and out

19:32.126 --> 19:34.371
of prison, her mother had a drug problem,

19:34.395 --> 19:35.988
wasn't around much.

19:36.012 --> 19:39.109
Would get clean, come back into
Kalohe's life, then relapse.

19:39.594 --> 19:40.978
Sounds awful.

19:41.002 --> 19:42.479
It was.

19:42.503 --> 19:44.448
Then I found out Kalohe was
sleeping overnight at school.

19:45.892 --> 19:47.151
From then on,

19:47.175 --> 19:50.220
I made sure she always had a
place to stay, always had food.

19:50.244 --> 19:52.489
Well, your concern for her
obviously made an impact,

19:52.513 --> 19:54.158
and she wanted to give back to the school

19:54.182 --> 19:55.993
and to the person who helped her.

19:56.017 --> 19:57.161
But the way she's going about it...

19:57.185 --> 19:58.729
I know it's wrong.

19:58.753 --> 20:01.064
But I also know her heart is
in the right place.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.536
You'll still help her, won't you?

20:05.661 --> 20:07.070
Of course we will. Yes.

20:07.094 --> 20:09.339
We just have to find her first.

20:09.363 --> 20:11.018
Did she have any other family?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.711
Anyone else she was close to?

20:14.769 --> 20:15.979
Yes.

20:16.003 --> 20:17.915
There was a family friend
who moved to the islands

20:17.939 --> 20:19.416
when Kalohe was a teenager.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.141
Great.

20:23.044 --> 20:24.978
I haven't seen Kalohe in months.

20:25.866 --> 20:26.999
Do you know where we can find her?

20:28.149 --> 20:29.793
Sorry. I don't.

20:29.817 --> 20:31.328
Uh, please.

20:31.352 --> 20:32.429
Kalohe's in trouble.

20:32.453 --> 20:33.964
There are two men after her.

20:33.988 --> 20:35.650
We just want to help her.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.236
It's okay, Auntie.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.977
How do I know you're not with them?

20:47.001 --> 20:48.979
Look, we can understand
why you'd be skeptical.

20:49.003 --> 20:51.888
But we were hired
by Principal Makani Mahelona.

20:51.912 --> 20:53.050
She's worried about you.

20:53.074 --> 20:54.484
We haven't talked in years.

20:54.508 --> 20:57.120
She asked us to find out
who was leaving the gifts,

20:57.144 --> 20:59.191
and that investigation led us to you.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.457
She told us how she helped you

21:00.481 --> 21:01.525
when you were a child.

21:02.635 --> 21:04.951
Why don't you put the
gun down so we can talk?

21:07.989 --> 21:09.466
Five nights ago, two guys

21:09.490 --> 21:12.169
grabbed me outside work, threw
me in their trunk, took off.

21:12.193 --> 21:14.504
But I managed to escape when
the car slowed for a stop sign.

21:14.528 --> 21:16.306
I presume you jumped out and ran away?

21:16.330 --> 21:18.475
Yeah. It was the middle of nowhere.

21:18.499 --> 21:21.345
They chased me, but I got away.

21:21.369 --> 21:22.947
With what I've been doing, I...

21:23.656 --> 21:25.849
I was too scared to go to the police.

21:25.873 --> 21:27.417
Do you know why these men are after you?

21:27.441 --> 21:30.128
No. But that's why I've been laying low.

21:30.152 --> 21:31.888
In case they try again.

21:31.912 --> 21:33.156
Odds are it has something to do

21:33.180 --> 21:35.115
with your extracurricular activities.

21:36.183 --> 21:38.495
Maybe you stole from the wrong people.

21:38.519 --> 21:40.264
What's the last thing you took?

21:40.923 --> 21:42.266
That can't be it.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.601
- Why do you say that?
- Because the last thing I stole

21:44.625 --> 21:47.894
was 35 fire extinguishers from a
warehouse club store in Waipahu.

21:49.249 --> 21:51.450
The school needed it to get
their building up to code.

21:52.935 --> 21:54.011
We have a list

21:54.035 --> 21:56.079
of all the retail robberies
in the last 18 months,

21:56.103 --> 21:59.016
and there wasn't anything
in Waipahu on that list.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.885
Which means the store
never reported the theft.

22:01.909 --> 22:03.387
Maybe they haven't realized it yet?

22:03.411 --> 22:05.355
Or they didn't want HPD involved.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.304
We got to get back to that school

22:07.329 --> 22:08.859
and check out those fire extinguishers.

22:08.883 --> 22:10.460
Yeah. Those guys are still after you,

22:10.484 --> 22:12.419
so it'd be best if you came with us.

22:20.494 --> 22:22.039
All right, pull it tight first.

22:22.063 --> 22:23.373
- 'Cause it's... All right. All right.
- Yo.

22:23.397 --> 22:24.855
Now you got to go way to TC's side.

22:24.879 --> 22:26.576
It should be center with the ships.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.753
Um, I can't see if it's centered.

22:27.778 --> 22:28.879
- More to TC.
- Sorry, the outrigger.

22:28.903 --> 22:30.881
- A little bit more. All right...
- ...this is killing my shoulder, man.

22:30.905 --> 22:32.215
We need it to be in the
center of the outrigger.

22:32.239 --> 22:33.650
But it's sagging. I can't see its center.

22:33.674 --> 22:35.152
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
hang on. Don't move. Don't move.

22:35.176 --> 22:37.154
Hey, pal. You ready

22:37.178 --> 22:39.489
for the best bachelor party
you'll ever have?

22:39.513 --> 22:41.021
It's totally unnecessary.

22:41.045 --> 22:43.126
Oh, come on. You
said it yourself. It's, uh...

22:43.150 --> 22:45.062
It's got to look legit.
It's all about the optics.

22:45.086 --> 22:47.064
All right, fine.
But as long as you invite Murph.

22:47.088 --> 22:48.332
Oh, yeah.

22:48.356 --> 22:49.633
Murph? No, he wouldn't miss it
for the world.

22:49.657 --> 22:51.568
Hey, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it earlier.

22:51.592 --> 22:53.503
How's he doing, by the way?
He get the job?

22:53.527 --> 22:54.504
Well, he's interviewing

22:54.528 --> 22:55.717
right now.

22:55.741 --> 22:56.940
In fact,

22:56.964 --> 22:58.442
probably crushing it as we speak.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.620
Ah, you know what?

23:00.644 --> 23:02.112
This is my boy Ronnie.
I got to take this.

23:02.136 --> 23:04.081
- Okay. I'll talk to you.
- Bro.

23:04.105 --> 23:06.350
It's Ronnie. It's Ronnie. Hey!

23:06.374 --> 23:07.640
Ronnie, how'd my boy do?

23:09.543 --> 23:11.121
What do you think?

23:11.145 --> 23:13.090
Can't tell if it's good news or bad news.

23:13.557 --> 23:14.658
Furrowed brow.

23:14.682 --> 23:17.260
Pursed lip. Rapid eye blinking.

23:17.284 --> 23:18.428
It ain't good.

23:18.452 --> 23:21.031
- All right, pal. Thanks.
- Well?

23:21.055 --> 23:22.199
He didn't get it, did he?

23:22.223 --> 23:24.267
He never even showed up
for the interview.

23:24.291 --> 23:27.604
I mean, after all the strings
I pulled, he bailed.

23:27.628 --> 23:28.862
Doesn't sound like Murph.

23:28.886 --> 23:30.540
He must have a good reason.

23:30.564 --> 23:32.042
He'd better.

23:32.239 --> 23:33.706
Straight to voice mail.

23:34.111 --> 23:35.479
Murph. Hey, it's Rick.

23:35.503 --> 23:37.036
Call me back.

23:43.411 --> 23:46.289
First he bails on Ronnie,
now he's ghosting us.

23:46.313 --> 23:48.158
Better have a good explanation.

23:48.182 --> 23:50.469
Hey, Murph!

23:52.805 --> 23:54.421
Murph, we're coming in!

24:06.277 --> 24:07.744
Murph?

24:07.768 --> 24:09.346
What's going on, buddy?

24:12.039 --> 24:14.474
I'm sorry, man, I just, uh...

24:16.676 --> 24:18.539
I couldn't do it.

24:24.518 --> 24:26.596
It's okay, Murph. Just...

24:27.019 --> 24:29.020
Just talk to us.

24:32.636 --> 24:35.338
I was 18 when I enlisted.

24:35.769 --> 24:37.036
Just a kid.

24:39.018 --> 24:40.444
For the past 30 years,

24:40.468 --> 24:43.280
I ate and slept at the same time.

24:43.814 --> 24:46.016
I had a mission every day.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.141
I led men into battle.

24:49.570 --> 24:51.571
I had a purpose.

24:54.381 --> 24:55.784
But now it's like...

24:57.578 --> 25:00.153
I don't even know
who the hell I am anymore.

25:03.083 --> 25:04.624
This right here.

25:06.494 --> 25:08.255
This is who I am.

25:09.006 --> 25:11.331
This is who I know how to be.

25:13.385 --> 25:15.137
I can't go back, but...

25:17.404 --> 25:20.540
I'm a damn fool to think
that I could do anything else.

25:21.810 --> 25:23.386
Hey.

25:24.021 --> 25:25.555
I get it.

25:25.579 --> 25:27.900
No. No, no, you don't.

25:28.415 --> 25:29.716
You're wrong.

25:34.907 --> 25:38.558
When I got back, I-I was lost.

25:39.536 --> 25:41.327
I was terrified.

25:42.665 --> 25:44.574
You know the...
you know that story I told you

25:44.598 --> 25:46.366
about Robin helping me out?

25:47.434 --> 25:48.578
Yeah.

25:48.602 --> 25:51.204
Well, I left out
the first half of that story.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.323
I left out the part where...

25:57.544 --> 25:59.242
I tried to reenlist.

26:02.220 --> 26:03.547
<i>Because just like you, I didn't think</i>

26:03.572 --> 26:04.939
<i>I'd fit in anywhere else.</i>

26:06.453 --> 26:08.331
- Sorry.
<i>- He said</i>

26:08.355 --> 26:10.657
<i>I wanted to come back
for the wrong reasons.</i>

26:24.505 --> 26:25.715
You really tried to go back?

26:26.687 --> 26:29.786
You know, I spent most
of my adult life with a...

26:29.810 --> 26:31.451
a rifle in my hand.

26:31.475 --> 26:33.490
And I-I didn't know...

26:34.069 --> 26:36.459
who I was gonna be without that.

26:36.483 --> 26:38.573
You know, I-I didn't know

26:39.219 --> 26:41.721
if I would ever figure out
who that guy was.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.121
It took some time.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.371
But I did.

26:49.251 --> 26:52.342
You know, I had to fake it a lot.

26:52.366 --> 26:54.801
I-I tried to stay busy, you know?

26:56.937 --> 26:58.699
But I had my buddies.

27:02.082 --> 27:04.027
And turned out pretty good.

27:08.916 --> 27:10.586
I'm happy for you.

27:11.754 --> 27:13.396
But I'm not like you.

27:13.420 --> 27:14.864
I'm not.

27:15.132 --> 27:17.790
I appreciate you guys
trying to help me. I really do.

27:18.859 --> 27:20.365
But...

27:20.389 --> 27:22.858
if I was to get that job and-and...

27:22.882 --> 27:24.841
and screw it up...
I mean, you vouched for me.

27:24.865 --> 27:27.210
Hey, I'd do it all over again.

27:27.234 --> 27:28.545
So would this guy.

27:28.569 --> 27:30.413
- Hell, yeah.
- Now, look,

27:30.437 --> 27:32.716
I-I got this guy, uh, Noah.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.784
He works at the bar. He-He's a vet.

27:34.808 --> 27:37.454
He-He's trying
to get his life back on track.

27:37.478 --> 27:38.855
Why don't you join him?

27:39.114 --> 27:40.523
I mean, doing what?

27:40.547 --> 27:42.959
Anything. Everything.

27:42.983 --> 27:46.229
I don't know. I mean,
look, i-it's not exciting,

27:46.253 --> 27:48.531
but it's a safe space.

27:48.555 --> 27:50.533
And there'd be some leeway
because I'm the boss.

27:50.557 --> 27:51.868
Not too much leeway,

27:51.892 --> 27:53.470
but you'd have structure.
You'd have a schedule.

27:53.879 --> 27:56.573
You know, just until you
figure out what you want to do.

27:56.597 --> 27:57.830
It could be good for you, Murph.

27:58.899 --> 28:00.667
Hey, listen.

28:03.602 --> 28:05.570
I'm giving you a shot.

28:06.607 --> 28:09.251
Because you got to
take a chance on yourself.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.215
I just don't believe in myself anymore.

28:17.785 --> 28:21.297
You're Master Gunnery Sergeant
Sean Murphy.

28:21.321 --> 28:23.733
You made us into Marines.

28:23.757 --> 28:25.202
Into men.

28:26.386 --> 28:29.321
Believed in us when we
didn't believe in ourselves.

28:30.497 --> 28:33.866
Now we're gonna believe in
you until you get there.

28:47.787 --> 28:49.265
- Magnum.
- Hey.

28:49.289 --> 28:50.599
One of my HPD contacts ID'd

28:50.623 --> 28:52.868
the owner of the car parked
outside Kalohe's house.

28:52.892 --> 28:55.771
Uh, the guy's name is Owen Shaw.
He lives in Haleiwa.

28:55.795 --> 28:57.606
- Rap sheet?
- Long one.

28:57.630 --> 28:59.708
I'm gonna send you what HPD
has on him right now,

28:59.732 --> 29:00.709
plus his cell phone number.

29:00.733 --> 29:01.767
Great.

29:05.271 --> 29:07.084
Okay, stand by.

29:09.253 --> 29:10.719
Got him.

29:10.743 --> 29:12.888
Shaw appears to be on Kamehameha Highway.

29:12.912 --> 29:14.290
He's heading north.

29:14.314 --> 29:15.357
He could be going home.

29:15.381 --> 29:16.859
I'll keep tabs on him.

29:16.883 --> 29:18.804
<i>Great. I'll meet you at the school.</i>

29:22.388 --> 29:24.393
Hi, Ms. Mahelona.

29:24.891 --> 29:26.229
Kalohe.

29:26.793 --> 29:29.023
You're okay.

29:40.427 --> 29:42.505
I know you won't accept payment,

29:42.529 --> 29:44.964
but I'm absolutely buying
you two a wedding gift.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.211
Kumu says you're getting married.

29:48.235 --> 29:50.546
- Uh, yes. Yes, we are.
- Right. We are.

29:50.570 --> 29:52.081
- This week, actually.
- Wow.

29:52.105 --> 29:54.016
You guys don't seem like a couple.

29:54.802 --> 29:57.353
Well, that's because, uh,
we want to keep things,

29:57.377 --> 29:58.488
uh, professional.

29:58.512 --> 30:00.256
Look, I don't want to cut this short,

30:00.280 --> 30:01.657
but we need to see
your fire extinguishers.

30:01.681 --> 30:02.892
It's very important.

30:02.916 --> 30:04.060
- Fire extinguishers?
- Yes.

30:04.084 --> 30:05.528
Have they all been installed yet?

30:05.552 --> 30:08.421
No. There's a few extras
in the supply room.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.071
The gauge says it's fully charged,

30:15.095 --> 30:17.206
but I don't feel the agent
moving around inside.

30:17.230 --> 30:19.331
Something's off.

30:24.070 --> 30:26.282
There's definitely something
in here, but it's not the agent.

30:26.306 --> 30:27.919
May I?

30:33.380 --> 30:35.558
How'd you get so handy with a saw?

30:35.582 --> 30:38.561
DT was my favorite class at school.

30:38.585 --> 30:40.920
Design technology...
I think you call it shop class.

30:46.126 --> 30:47.993
You were right.
There's something in there.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.409
That's certainly not gonna
put out a fire.

30:53.433 --> 30:55.077
- Is that...?
- Cocaine.

30:55.101 --> 30:56.345
It looks like you stole
these fire extinguishers

30:56.369 --> 30:58.414
from drug dealers.
We got to call Katsumoto.

30:58.438 --> 31:00.249
I don't understand.
Why were they in the store?

31:00.273 --> 31:03.178
An employee must have been using
them to smuggle the drugs.

31:03.202 --> 31:06.122
Magnum. Shaw's on the move. Look.

31:06.146 --> 31:08.391
He was going north on Kamehameha
Highway, away from us.

31:08.415 --> 31:10.293
Now he's coming south,
and far more quickly.

31:10.317 --> 31:11.494
If he veers off here onto the 80,

31:11.518 --> 31:13.756
then he's coming straight to us.

31:15.455 --> 31:16.666
He turned. He's coming this way.

31:16.690 --> 31:17.700
How did he find me?

31:17.724 --> 31:20.303
- Maybe he found Kiana.
- Oh, my God.

31:20.327 --> 31:22.004
Kiana knew where we were going and why.

31:22.028 --> 31:23.005
That means they know the drugs are here,

31:23.029 --> 31:24.674
and they're coming for them.

31:25.674 --> 31:27.283
She's not picking up.
I'm calling the police.

31:27.307 --> 31:29.512
HPD's not gonna make it here
before Shaw and his men do.

31:29.536 --> 31:31.314
And we don't have enough time
to clear everyone out of here.

31:31.338 --> 31:32.615
Look, we only have one play.

31:32.639 --> 31:34.116
We got to get the rest of the drugs

31:34.140 --> 31:35.585
and lead Shaw and his men

31:35.609 --> 31:37.328
as far away from here as we can.

31:56.496 --> 31:57.473
We got to move.

32:01.995 --> 32:03.006
Move.

32:03.031 --> 32:05.109
They're blocking our only way out.

32:05.134 --> 32:06.935
Grab a hold of something.

32:33.047 --> 32:34.190
We've got company.

32:40.087 --> 32:42.232
If this bus has another gear,
you'd better use it!

32:42.256 --> 32:44.701
I'm already redlining it!

32:44.725 --> 32:47.460
Everyone, get down!

33:11.218 --> 33:12.585
Stay down!

33:34.708 --> 33:36.658
Hey, come up front. I have an idea.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.492
Stay down.

33:44.985 --> 33:47.097
- What's the plan?
- Hold onto something.

33:47.121 --> 33:48.632
<i>Growing up, I didn't always love school,</i>

33:48.656 --> 33:50.467
<i>but in the sixth grade I had a teacher</i>

33:50.491 --> 33:51.768
<i>who made science fun.</i>

33:51.792 --> 33:54.070
Okay, everybody brace yourselves again.

33:54.094 --> 33:55.538
<i>One thing I remember, courtesy of Newton,</i>

33:55.562 --> 33:59.042
<i>is a body in motion will remain
in motion, unless...</i>

34:06.006 --> 34:07.223
You all right?

34:23.456 --> 34:24.434
Let's go, let's go.

34:35.415 --> 34:37.248
I brought you a gift.

34:41.275 --> 34:42.452
Fire extinguishers?

34:42.476 --> 34:44.476
Wait till you see what's inside.

34:56.389 --> 34:58.702
And you're certain about this?

34:58.726 --> 35:00.136
'Cause you can take a few days

35:00.160 --> 35:01.777
to think about it, you know.

35:05.132 --> 35:07.449
Okay. Thank you so much.

35:07.835 --> 35:09.743
You're such a good friend.

35:10.537 --> 35:11.865
Bye.

35:14.135 --> 35:15.852
Everything okay?

35:15.876 --> 35:17.687
Yes, everything's fine.

35:18.002 --> 35:21.391
I just thought you'd want
to know that I spoke to Makani.

35:21.415 --> 35:22.726
It looks like the prosecuting attorney

35:22.750 --> 35:24.728
is going to grant Kalohe immunity

35:24.752 --> 35:26.329
in exchange for her testimony.

35:26.353 --> 35:27.697
That's great news.

35:27.721 --> 35:29.532
I'm so happy it's all working out.

35:29.556 --> 35:31.634
I really can't thank you
and Thomas enough.

35:31.658 --> 35:33.737
Oh, it's a pleasure, of course.

35:33.761 --> 35:36.873
You know, I feel guilty
about not planning

35:36.897 --> 35:39.289
a bachelorette party for you.

35:40.469 --> 35:41.745
Kumu...

35:41.769 --> 35:44.147
do I really strike you
as someone who's willing

35:44.171 --> 35:46.082
to place singles inside a G-string

35:46.106 --> 35:48.251
whilst wearing a pornographic crown?

35:48.275 --> 35:49.552
I guess that's more me, huh?

35:50.911 --> 35:51.855
How about dinner, then?

35:51.879 --> 35:53.256
Yes, that'd be great.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.891
Just, um, give me a few minutes.

35:54.915 --> 35:56.290
Okay.

36:03.724 --> 36:06.236
- Hi.
- Hey. Just heading out.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.010
Oh, where are you going?

36:08.629 --> 36:10.840
Bachelor party. Rick insisted.

36:10.864 --> 36:14.410
Just so you know, you got
nothing to worry about.

36:14.434 --> 36:15.434
About that.

36:16.904 --> 36:18.729
Thomas, I...

36:20.741 --> 36:24.110
I've reconsidered
my decision to marry you.

36:26.647 --> 36:27.891
What are you talking about?

36:28.614 --> 36:30.193
I've been thinking about it,

36:30.217 --> 36:31.628
and I just think it's gonna be

36:31.652 --> 36:33.263
far too hard to pull it off.

36:33.287 --> 36:35.465
I mean, our working partnership
is gonna make it

36:35.489 --> 36:37.267
next to impossible, and if we get caught,

36:37.291 --> 36:40.293
the ramifications are too severe.

36:42.368 --> 36:46.515
Yeah, but if you don't do this,
they're gonna send you home.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.841
I know.

36:49.670 --> 36:51.748
So I am getting married.

36:52.429 --> 36:53.783
Just...

36:54.473 --> 36:55.808
to someone else.

36:58.512 --> 37:00.854
I don't understand.

37:02.016 --> 37:07.419
I expressed my concerns
to another good friend,

37:07.444 --> 37:09.678
and he was willing to step in.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.338
Well, okay.

37:16.662 --> 37:18.631
Look, Thomas.

37:20.968 --> 37:24.347
I'm really sorry
to put you through all this.

37:24.962 --> 37:26.688
For what it's worth,

37:26.713 --> 37:29.024
I really appreciate what you
were willing to do for me.

37:29.049 --> 37:30.259
You know?

37:31.611 --> 37:32.778
It means a lot.

37:37.851 --> 37:39.435
So, who are you marrying?

37:39.853 --> 37:42.365
I cannot believe that you're doing it.

37:42.389 --> 37:43.666
Look, if it's me,

37:43.690 --> 37:44.901
then Higgy don't got to
pretend all the time.

37:44.925 --> 37:46.636
We got a better chance
of getting away with it.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.372
And, hey, anything for family, right?

37:49.396 --> 37:51.374
Yeah. Hey, speaking of family,

37:51.398 --> 37:52.675
you think Murph's gonna show up?

37:52.699 --> 37:54.777
I don't know.

37:54.801 --> 37:56.980
I mean, you can give somebody
every opportunity,

37:57.004 --> 37:58.548
but it don't matter
if they don't want it.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.321

38:07.296 --> 38:09.626
Uh... I don't know.

38:09.650 --> 38:10.693
I was embarrassed.

38:10.717 --> 38:12.395
You know, you, Thomas, Nuzo,

38:12.419 --> 38:14.297
you guys seemed to
have it all figured out

38:14.321 --> 38:15.454
when we got back.

38:15.478 --> 38:17.467
I was still finding my way.

38:17.491 --> 38:19.736
Man, it might have
looked easy, but it wasn't.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.471
Look, you should've told us.

38:21.495 --> 38:22.839
We would have been there for you.

38:22.863 --> 38:25.177
- You know I always got your back, right?

- Happy to be here.

- Hey, what's going on, man?

giving you the shaft, pal.

39:13.714 --> 39:14.924
Yeah, yeah, I got to say

39:14.948 --> 39:16.125
I was kind of bummed out.

39:16.149 --> 39:17.460
You know, I was looking forward
to the wedding,

39:17.484 --> 39:19.963
but Higgins gets to stay
in Hawaii, so it's all good.

39:19.987 --> 39:21.364
, I'm confused.

39:21.388 --> 39:22.465
Where are the strippers?

39:22.489 --> 39:24.867
Dude, it's 2020, man.

39:24.891 --> 39:27.103
Okay. Well, then we can have
20 female strippers

39:27.127 --> 39:29.305
and 20 male strippers... that's equality.

39:29.329 --> 39:30.974
Jin, we're just gonna hang out,

39:30.998 --> 39:32.575
sit down, have a couple drinks,

39:32.599 --> 39:33.943
we're gonna listen to some tunes,

39:33.967 --> 39:35.912
and maybe break out the cards.
You want to join us?

39:35.936 --> 39:37.366
What is wrong with you?

39:37.390 --> 39:39.248
Stag night is a time-honored tradition.

39:39.272 --> 39:42.819
It's all about getting wasted
and making mistakes

39:42.843 --> 39:45.788
and waking up next to
a stranger, Downey-style.

39:45.812 --> 39:46.756
Okay.

39:46.780 --> 39:47.991
You know what I mean, Magnum?

39:48.015 --> 39:48.992
You back me up?

39:49.016 --> 39:51.094
You got to ask TC. It's his celebration.

39:51.118 --> 39:52.962
Then we better get a new cake topper.

39:52.986 --> 39:55.345
Look, the scam will be easier
to pull off if it's me.

39:55.369 --> 39:57.667
- You know, I did not see that coming.
- I know.

39:57.691 --> 39:59.836
I still can't believe
she didn't ask me. So weird.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.671
Come on, I'm sure you were third in line.

40:03.350 --> 40:05.842
I want to say a couple words
to the man of the hour.

40:05.866 --> 40:09.078
TC, I never thought that
I'd be so cool with somebody

40:09.102 --> 40:11.514
stabbing me in the back
and stealing my fiancée.

40:12.873 --> 40:16.953
But I hope you and Higgins
have a-a beautiful

40:16.977 --> 40:18.154
fake life together.

40:18.178 --> 40:19.822
Thank you, brother.

40:19.846 --> 40:21.958
Cheers.

40:21.982 --> 40:25.361
Also-also, to our sister Juliet Higgins,

40:25.385 --> 40:27.964
who now gets to be
a part of our lives forever.

40:27.988 --> 40:29.492
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.435
Higgy.
