that we're looking for him,

that he's not
still in Mystic Falls,

13:26.457 --> 13:28.242
and they can't know that we know
that he's here, because they

13:28.285 --> 13:30.200
don't know that he goes
to school with us, which...

13:30.244 --> 13:32.289
we can't tell them, because
then we'd have to explain

13:32.333 --> 13:34.291
that he's supernatural, which
he clearly hasn't told them,

13:34.335 --> 13:36.598
but that's probably just
because of the glitch in powers,

13:36.641 --> 13:38.643

but they can't.
