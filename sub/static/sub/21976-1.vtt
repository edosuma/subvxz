WEBVTT

01:24.001 --> 01:25.303
Eggy.

01:27.872 --> 01:30.207
You mind if I share your cab?

01:39.715 --> 01:40.717
Charlie?

01:44.287 --> 01:46.623
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:46.656 --> 01:49.226
You look like a gentleman,
I look like a pleb.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.397
If I was you,
I'd unlock your cab.

02:11.448 --> 02:14.152
Pete, get us out of here!

02:35.606 --> 02:37.408
You think that shit's
gonna work this time?

02:38.475 --> 02:40.278
You're way out of your depth.

03:26.256 --> 03:27.457
Fuck!

05:37.821 --> 05:39.590
Take him out!

05:49.934 --> 05:51.501
Merlin! We've got
a Code Purple.

05:51.535 --> 05:52.569
My driver's down.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.805
Permission to blow
these fuckers away.

05:54.838 --> 05:55.939
Denied.

05:55.973 --> 05:57.941
Cannot be contained.

05:57.975 --> 05:59.610
Head south,
I'm clearing the route.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.489
Shit!

06:50.694 --> 06:52.129
Merlin, I'm entering Hyde Park.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.031
Can I get on with it?

06:57.367 --> 06:58.501
Merlin!

06:58.535 --> 07:00.436
Dark zone confirmed.
Permission to fire.

07:00.470 --> 07:01.739
Oh, thank fuck for that!

07:17.420 --> 07:20.256
No time to relax.
Police are right behind you.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.593
You have 30 seconds before
they reach your position.

07:22.626 --> 07:24.828
Go directly to Rendezvous Swan.

07:35.439 --> 07:38.141
Merlin, you do realize
I haven't even got a windscreen right now?

07:38.174 --> 07:39.614
I seem to remember
from your training

07:39.643 --> 07:41.355
you were rather good
at holding your breath.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.388
It wasn't a revenge mission.

09:21.412 --> 09:23.614
Charlie could've just
killed you immediately.

09:23.648 --> 09:25.449
Not boasting,
but I trained him well enough

09:25.483 --> 09:26.883
that even he wouldn't
mess that up.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.051
Merlin, I'm sorry,

09:28.085 --> 09:29.495
we're gonna have to do
the debrief tomorrow.

09:29.519 --> 09:30.831
I've got to get
to a dinner tonight...

09:30.855 --> 09:31.898
and if I miss it, let's just say

09:31.922 --> 09:33.233
Charlie might as well
have killed me.

09:33.257 --> 09:34.124
Well, if you can't wait

09:34.158 --> 09:35.301
for the police
to clear the park...

09:35.325 --> 09:36.826
there's another way out
in the corner.

09:47.604 --> 09:48.605
Fuck!

09:50.507 --> 09:52.343
How important is that dinner?

09:57.246 --> 09:58.281
Let me show you.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.129
For fuck's sake!

10:48.432 --> 10:50.467
Babe.

10:51.701 --> 10:53.003
I'm home!

10:53.037 --> 10:54.071
I'm here.

11:00.543 --> 11:02.312
What the hell happened?

11:02.345 --> 11:05.816
It's a long story
that deserves a kiss.

11:05.850 --> 11:08.351
Not even JB
would kiss you right now.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.922
If you really love me,
just one little kiss.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.394
You were really gonna do it?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.529
Yeah.

11:19.562 --> 11:21.097
Now, that is
true love right there.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.333
Amazing. I'm gonna
go get changed.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.904
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

11:32.741 --> 11:35.311
And Tilde made that
for you herself, bruv.

11:35.345 --> 11:36.678
Mmm-hmm.

11:36.712 --> 11:38.414
The royal baker's not available.

11:39.682 --> 11:40.951
Oh, shut up, Brandon.

11:40.984 --> 11:43.253
Especially if you
want some of this.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.455
Oh! Wait. Is that that
Swedish stuff right there?

11:45.489 --> 11:46.290
Yes.

11:46.322 --> 11:47.733
No, no. I ain't drinkin'
none of that.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.426
Last time here,
I was wrecked, man.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.437
Yeah, but that's 'cause you
were a lightweight, Jamal.

11:52.762 --> 11:55.699
No, no, babe, I'm good.
Not for me, thank you.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.835
Oh, what?
What's going on, man?

11:57.868 --> 11:58.903
I'm meeting her parents

11:58.936 --> 12:00.302
for the first time
tomorrow night.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.372
I wanna make a good
impression, so what?

12:03.406 --> 12:05.742
Oh, yeah, Jamal,
are you free to dogsit JB

12:05.776 --> 12:07.111
tomorrow night
while we're there?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.513
Ah, sorry, bruv, I've got
to look after my nan tomorrow.

12:09.546 --> 12:10.748
But Liam's free, though.

12:10.781 --> 12:11.882
Oh, yeah?

12:11.914 --> 12:14.050
I can't, mate.
I'm allergic to dogs.

12:14.084 --> 12:14.985
Bullshit.

12:15.018 --> 12:16.319
Dogshit, actually.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.298
That leaves you, Brandon.
What you doing tomorrow night?

12:19.322 --> 12:20.890
Yeah, I'll look after
your dog, mate,

12:20.923 --> 12:22.492
but I got one condition.

12:22.526 --> 12:23.627
What's that?

12:23.661 --> 12:25.262
You have a drink with us.
Yeah.

12:25.296 --> 12:26.497
Got to do it, babe.

12:26.529 --> 12:27.663
Got to do it.

12:27.696 --> 12:29.232
Brandon, happy birthday!

12:29.800 --> 12:31.168
Happy birthday.

12:31.201 --> 12:32.503
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

12:33.235 --> 12:34.237
Shit.

12:37.072 --> 12:40.043
My drugs are everywhere.

12:41.945 --> 12:43.647
They were never my thing...

12:43.681 --> 12:44.915
but here I am,

12:44.947 --> 12:49.052
running the biggest
drug cartel in the world.

12:49.086 --> 12:53.557
The only downside is having to
live in the middle of nowhere.

12:55.959 --> 12:59.563
You know, these ruins
are technically undiscovered.

12:59.595 --> 13:02.866
I just added a few touches
to remind me of home.

13:04.066 --> 13:08.104
I grew up on all that
awesome 50s nostalgia.

13:08.138 --> 13:11.575
Grease. American Graffiti.
Happy Days.

13:12.842 --> 13:14.310
But I digress.

13:14.345 --> 13:16.213
The thing you need to understand

13:16.245 --> 13:18.314
is the hard work
and ingenuity...

13:18.347 --> 13:21.684
it took to achieve
a global monopoly...

13:21.717 --> 13:24.085
on the drug trade.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.256
And that's all on me.
Not to toot my own horn...

13:27.289 --> 13:28.791
I just think
it's really important

13:28.826 --> 13:30.694
for new recruits
to understand...

13:30.726 --> 13:33.630
the history
of The Golden Circle.

13:38.100 --> 13:41.871
So. Lifelong friends, huh?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.807
Charles, do you think
your buddy here

13:43.840 --> 13:45.341
is worthy of joining us?

13:45.374 --> 13:46.942
Ms. Poppy, I would
not have brought him

13:46.976 --> 13:48.587
all the way to see you
if I didn't think so.

13:48.611 --> 13:50.546
Excellent.
Well, you hungry?

13:50.581 --> 13:51.748
Starving.

13:51.782 --> 13:54.151
Wonderful! Right this way.

13:54.183 --> 13:55.985
Make yourselves at home.

13:57.354 --> 13:59.388
So, fellas...

13:59.422 --> 14:03.259
I have a couple of things
that I wanna clarify.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.529
You understand that
in The Golden Circle...

14:06.562 --> 14:10.033
my authority is never
to be questioned, right?

14:10.066 --> 14:11.835
And the importance
of following orders?

14:11.868 --> 14:14.003
Do you understand that?

14:14.037 --> 14:16.105
And the value of loyalty?

14:17.039 --> 14:19.108
It's easy to nod, isn't it?

14:21.811 --> 14:24.514
I don't like easy.
I like proof.

14:29.419 --> 14:32.321
What's your name?
Angel, ma'am.

14:32.355 --> 14:33.856
Angel, baby.

14:33.890 --> 14:34.990
Hey.

14:35.023 --> 14:37.293
Your old pal, Charles,
has messed up.

14:37.326 --> 14:38.729
That's all I'm gonna tell you,

14:38.762 --> 14:39.904
'cause that's all
you need to know.

14:39.928 --> 14:41.432
So put him in the mincer, okay?

15:43.826 --> 15:46.029
No, Miss Poppy!

16:05.349 --> 16:06.449
Good job!

16:08.018 --> 16:10.119
See my salon across the way?

16:13.456 --> 16:15.459
Head there for your makeover.

16:25.601 --> 16:28.504
Eggsy, I hope you're hungry.

16:31.307 --> 16:34.244
Oh, babe, I was gonna
grab breakfast at work.

16:34.277 --> 16:35.555
This looks lovely,
but I'm running late.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.915
I just thought maybe
we could practice?

16:38.947 --> 16:40.049
For tonight.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.784
Practice?
Mm-hmm.

16:41.817 --> 16:42.818
Eating?

16:42.853 --> 16:46.023
You said you've never
eaten at a palace before.

16:46.056 --> 16:49.826
And Pappa is sort of picky
about table manners.

16:49.860 --> 16:52.895
Well, as it happens, babe,
I've got this shit on lock.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.263
I know what every single one

16:54.297 --> 16:56.232
of them knives and forks is for.

16:58.701 --> 17:00.703
This is a butter knife.

17:00.736 --> 17:02.047
It's the only one
you need to remember,

17:02.071 --> 17:03.311
the rest of the cutlery is easy.

17:03.339 --> 17:04.441
You start from the outside,

17:04.473 --> 17:06.676
and you work your way in
with each course.

17:06.710 --> 17:09.512
And never let anyone
describe you as "H.K.L.P."...

17:09.546 --> 17:10.680
What's that?

17:10.712 --> 17:12.315
"Holds knife like pen."

17:12.347 --> 17:13.582
A habit erroneously believed

17:13.615 --> 17:15.684
to be upper class
dining etiquette.

17:15.719 --> 17:17.587
It is quite the opposite.

17:19.890 --> 17:24.361
White wine, pudding wine,
red wine, water and pop.

17:24.393 --> 17:26.262
Or whatever tipple
takes your fancy.

17:28.097 --> 17:29.341
Am I supposed to wait
for everyone else

17:29.365 --> 17:30.708
to be served
before I start eating?

17:30.732 --> 17:32.445
Only if the dish
being served is cold.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.572
Or if the Queen is present.
Otherwise tuck in.

17:37.106 --> 17:38.474
Got to be honest...

17:38.508 --> 17:40.877
never really thought
the royalty bit would be relevant.

17:41.845 --> 17:43.180
Harry would've been chuffed.

17:44.514 --> 17:46.850
Oh. I wish I could've met him.

17:52.389 --> 17:54.825
You miss him too,
don't you, Mr. Pickle?

17:56.625 --> 17:57.728
Mmm?

18:07.103 --> 18:08.505
Mr. Pickle says, "Yeah."

18:10.140 --> 18:11.974
Hey, no, no, sit down, I'm fine.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.911
I'm fine. Have a good day.

18:14.743 --> 18:15.745
Okay.

18:42.905 --> 18:46.108
Ah, Galahad! You're late.

18:46.142 --> 18:47.911
We were wondering if you'd had

18:47.944 --> 18:49.779
a second encounter with Charlie.

18:49.813 --> 18:52.649
I wish. I'm looking forward
to finishing him off.

18:57.185 --> 18:58.521
All right, gents.

19:00.022 --> 19:01.257
Merlin, come in.

19:01.924 --> 19:03.026
Galahad and Lancelot,

19:03.058 --> 19:05.194
please remain
for Merlin's debrief.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.798
Everyone else,
reconvene at 1900 hours.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.268
So...

19:12.734 --> 19:14.870
the man who attacked
Galahad in the taxi

19:14.904 --> 19:16.440
was Charlie Hesketh.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.540
Rejected Kingsman
applicant turned bad.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.076
We last saw him back
at Richmond Valentine's HQ.

19:21.109 --> 19:23.412
I've caught a fucking spy!

19:27.517 --> 19:29.186
Like everyone else there...

19:29.219 --> 19:31.321
Charlie had a security implant
in his neck.

19:31.354 --> 19:34.290
A weakness we had no choice
but to exploit.

19:36.326 --> 19:40.396
Hey, Merlin.
Still fucking spectacular, eh?

19:42.798 --> 19:45.434
Come on, guys, loosen up.
We saved the world.

19:46.068 --> 19:47.336
Yeah.

19:47.370 --> 19:51.341
Unfortunately, Galahad,
you also saved Charlie.

19:51.374 --> 19:54.344
When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

19:54.377 --> 19:55.912
Instead of his head exploding...

19:55.944 --> 19:58.414
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

19:59.347 --> 20:00.616
Fucker should be thanking me.

20:00.650 --> 20:02.384
And now he's back for revenge?

20:02.418 --> 20:04.120
We don't think so, sir.

20:04.153 --> 20:05.263
We believe he's being recruited

20:05.287 --> 20:06.689
by an unknown organization.

20:06.722 --> 20:07.923
Lancelot?

20:07.957 --> 20:09.358
Got the police autopsy reports

20:09.392 --> 20:12.228
from Charlie's colleagues
in the SUVs.

20:12.261 --> 20:13.730
They're not just goons for hire.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.965
Fingerprints removed.

20:15.998 --> 20:17.100
Teeth filed smooth.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.670
I did a face recognition.
Nothing.

20:19.702 --> 20:20.670
And that thing?

20:20.702 --> 20:24.340
A cosmetic tattoo
made of 24-carat gold.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.209
They all had them.

20:26.241 --> 20:30.047
Seems like we're looking
at some kind of underworld organization.

20:33.950 --> 20:36.619
Senora Poppy has sent me
for my makeover.

20:36.653 --> 20:37.754
Follow me.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.693
Please take your shirt off.

21:25.468 --> 21:26.702
It's beautiful, isn't it?

21:27.871 --> 21:29.473
Not that.

21:30.339 --> 21:31.607

22:37.338 --> 22:39.975
Mmm.

22:42.812 --> 22:44.848
I think we should
do you the favor

22:44.881 --> 22:47.150
of conversing in English, yes.

22:50.019 --> 22:51.253
So, tell me...

22:51.287 --> 22:52.488
what do you do?

22:52.521 --> 22:55.090
I work for Kingsman,
the tailors, Your Highness.

22:55.124 --> 22:58.327
You may address my daughter
as "Your Highness."

22:58.361 --> 23:01.864
Please address the Queen and
myself with "Your Majesty."

23:01.897 --> 23:04.266
Pappa, this is
a family dinner...

23:04.299 --> 23:06.702
not some state function.

23:06.736 --> 23:09.572
Well then, Eggsy.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.941
What do you make
of the current situation

23:11.974 --> 23:14.043
in the Indian financial markets?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.679
Pappa!

23:16.245 --> 23:17.647
Uh...

23:20.316 --> 23:21.550
Well...

23:24.053 --> 23:25.955
I don't think we can
underestimate the impact

23:25.989 --> 23:28.723
of ECB's quantitative
easing measures.

23:28.758 --> 23:29.868
And of course,
the liquidity wave

23:29.892 --> 23:31.559
from the US Federal
Reserve rate hike...

23:31.594 --> 23:33.063
getting pushed back.

23:42.470 --> 23:44.105
Frida Kahlo.

23:44.140 --> 23:48.244
Well, other than the 1939
acquisition by the Louvre...

23:48.277 --> 23:49.578
she wasn't really acknowledged

23:49.612 --> 23:51.314
until the new Mexicanisimo
art movement...

23:51.346 --> 23:53.016
of the late 1970s.

23:57.953 --> 23:59.588
Moorish revival.

23:59.622 --> 24:01.490
Ah. The Palazzo Sammezzano.

24:01.524 --> 24:02.826
In Tuscany.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.193
Beautiful.

24:06.496 --> 24:07.730
Bluetooth technology.

24:07.762 --> 24:09.397
Which, of course, got its name

24:09.432 --> 24:11.200
from the legendary
Danish king...

24:11.233 --> 24:12.867
Harald Blatand, whose name

24:12.902 --> 24:16.037
translates to
"Bluetooth" in English.

24:16.072 --> 24:17.673
And the Bluetooth logo
is his initials

24:17.705 --> 24:19.274
in Norse runic symbols.

24:19.307 --> 24:21.376
And, as I'm sure you know...

24:21.410 --> 24:23.779
the Bluetooth logo
is his initials...

24:23.813 --> 24:25.582
in Norse runic symbols.

24:26.281 --> 24:27.215
Oh, my God, Eggsy.

24:27.249 --> 24:29.085
Why isn't he eating
his fucking pudding?

24:29.117 --> 24:30.952
I need to research
this gold tattoo.

24:30.987 --> 24:32.288
I found records of other people

24:32.322 --> 24:33.790
with the same
body modifications.

24:35.524 --> 24:36.935
All of them have
high level involvement...

24:36.959 --> 24:39.061
with crime and international
drug trafficking.

24:39.095 --> 24:42.163
And there's rumors of something
called The Golden Circle.

24:42.198 --> 24:43.266
Hmm.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.173
Best agent or best friend?

25:00.149 --> 25:02.952
Come on, JB.
Give it a rest, mate.

25:02.986 --> 25:06.189
Stop scratching the door.
I'm gonna get the blame now.

25:06.221 --> 25:07.222
There you are. Happy?

25:22.305 --> 25:24.039
With the decks and all that.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.710
Shit, boy!

25:27.743 --> 25:29.111
What the...

25:36.518 --> 25:37.787
Do you reckon, JB...

25:38.755 --> 25:40.090
model material?

25:42.992 --> 25:46.061
I must say, you're really
not as I expected.

25:47.329 --> 25:49.432
Well, thank you very much...

25:49.466 --> 25:51.100
Your Majesty.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.869
Eggsy?
Is that you, mate?

25:52.902 --> 25:54.836
What the fuck is going on here?

25:54.870 --> 25:56.239
You a gangster now or something?

25:56.271 --> 25:58.840
Fuckin' hell. Is that Tilde's
mom and dad's house?

25:58.874 --> 26:00.519
Tell you what. Whatever
you're doing, I want in.

26:02.243 --> 26:03.946
Put it down!

26:04.480 --> 26:05.882
Why?

26:06.481 --> 26:08.518
I said, put it down now!

26:08.550 --> 26:09.752
What's wrong with it?

26:10.519 --> 26:12.254
Shut it! Fucking shut it!

26:12.287 --> 26:13.922
Eggsy.
I beg your pardon?

26:13.957 --> 26:15.725
Shut it! Shut it now!

26:15.758 --> 26:18.193
All right, mate.
Chill your boots.

26:19.295 --> 26:21.797
Eggsy, what...

26:21.830 --> 26:23.932
Oh, no. Oh, my God, no.
I'm so sorry.

26:25.034 --> 26:26.994
You shut up and all.
You got me in enough trouble.

26:54.095 --> 26:56.432
The next order of business...

26:56.466 --> 26:58.334
Agent Percival.

27:05.074 --> 27:06.142
Arthur.

27:09.746 --> 27:10.947
Oh, fuck.

27:16.751 --> 27:18.387
Yep.

27:18.421 --> 27:21.825
Kingsman is crumpets.

27:23.491 --> 27:27.396
Like toast, but British.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.097
And to say thank you...

27:29.131 --> 27:31.701
I got you a present, Charlie.

27:31.733 --> 27:36.772
My guys made you this.

27:38.874 --> 27:43.479
Bigger, badder, better.
I call it...

27:43.512 --> 27:46.048
ARMageddon.

28:05.268 --> 28:07.202
Let's see if your game improves.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.350
Ouch.

28:59.255 --> 29:01.056
Someone decides to wipe out

29:01.089 --> 29:02.891
every Kingsman property...

29:02.924 --> 29:05.294
every agent, and somehow...

29:05.327 --> 29:08.096
conveniently,
you weren't at home.

29:08.130 --> 29:09.899
I could say the same thing
about you.

29:09.932 --> 29:12.300
What, you think I'd kill Roxy?

29:12.334 --> 29:15.171
And my mate, Brandon,
and my fucking dog?

29:15.203 --> 29:16.205
No.

29:18.539 --> 29:19.875
You think I would?

29:24.412 --> 29:26.883
This thing...

29:27.816 --> 29:30.184
hacked us.

29:30.219 --> 29:32.588
Clearly, this arm can be
remotely controlled.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.190
I'm only alive
because my address

29:35.223 --> 29:37.426
wasn't on the database
with the agents.

29:38.294 --> 29:39.595
Whoever Charlie's working with

29:39.628 --> 29:44.366
doesn't think that mere
staff are missile-worthy.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.801
This ain't funny.

29:46.836 --> 29:48.938
Roxy is dead!

29:48.970 --> 29:51.106
Everyone's dead! Gone!
Do you even care?

29:51.140 --> 29:52.675
Pull yourself together.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.143
Remember your training.

29:55.176 --> 29:57.079
There's no time for emotion
in this scenario.

30:00.516 --> 30:01.617
Now...

30:01.651 --> 30:03.818
as all surviving agents
are present,

30:03.853 --> 30:06.221
we follow the doomsday protocol.

30:06.255 --> 30:09.459
When that's done,
and only then...

30:11.727 --> 30:13.863
you may shed a tear in private.

30:16.664 --> 30:18.634
Okay.

30:18.666 --> 30:20.202
What's the doomsday protocol?

30:21.671 --> 30:23.273
We go shopping.

30:37.487 --> 30:40.989
We're from Kingsman.
We'd like to buy some wine.

30:41.022 --> 30:44.026
And use tasting room
number three, please.

30:47.662 --> 30:49.132
Not one of my predecessors

30:49.164 --> 30:51.366
has ever been
in this situation before.

30:53.568 --> 30:54.970
Thank God.

30:58.173 --> 30:59.174
A-ha.

31:02.711 --> 31:03.945
Remember this?

31:03.980 --> 31:05.248
Yeah, how could I forget?

31:14.522 --> 31:17.592
Whatever's in that safe
is the answer to all our problems.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.402
Huh.

31:33.842 --> 31:35.044
Is that it?

31:35.076 --> 31:37.279
I suppose that must be
upper-class humor.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.249
I don't get it.

31:40.281 --> 31:42.321
Me neither. What the fuck
are we supposed to do now?

31:43.986 --> 31:45.188
I think we should drink a toast

31:45.220 --> 31:47.056
to our fallen comrades.

31:51.692 --> 31:52.795
To Roxy.

31:52.827 --> 31:54.062
Roxy.

31:57.967 --> 31:59.201
Ooh.

32:02.238 --> 32:04.307
To Arthur.
Arthur.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.211
Mmm.

32:09.243 --> 32:10.578
Should we do one for JB?

32:10.612 --> 32:11.781
I think we should.

32:25.393 --> 32:27.462
I should have seen it coming.

32:28.130 --> 32:29.864
Charlie, the taxi.

32:29.897 --> 32:31.232
It's all my fault.

32:31.266 --> 32:35.071
No, that's bullshit, Merlin.
It ain't all your fault.

32:35.904 --> 32:37.572
You're the best, bruv.

32:37.605 --> 32:39.508
Honestly, without you...

32:39.541 --> 32:41.743
I'd have lost it
a long time ago.

32:44.479 --> 32:46.181
I think we should
drink to Scotland.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.117
I think we've probably
had enough, to be honest.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.420
You're probably right.

32:58.961 --> 33:01.296
Merlin.
Aye?

33:01.329 --> 33:03.598
I think we're going to Kentucky.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.601
Fried Chicken?

33:05.634 --> 33:06.801
I love fried chicken.

33:06.836 --> 33:09.372
No, proper Kentucky. Look.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.207
You know what else I love?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.809
Country and western music.

33:14.809 --> 33:17.179
♪ Country roads ♪

33:17.813 --> 33:19.816
♪ Take me home ♪

33:20.782 --> 33:24.653
♪ To the place I belong ♪

33:43.139 --> 33:46.175
Oh! Here's where we leave
the casks to age.

33:46.208 --> 33:47.409
Unfortunately, we can't go in,

33:47.442 --> 33:50.078
as it's a temperature-controlled
environment.

33:50.113 --> 33:52.748
So let's move on to
our world class stud farm...

33:52.780 --> 33:55.683
and meet three of
our Kentucky Derby winners.

33:58.653 --> 34:00.823
Biometric security scanner
just to protect

34:00.855 --> 34:03.090
a few old barrels of whiskey?

34:03.124 --> 34:04.727
Pull the other one, love.

34:05.594 --> 34:06.729
Got it.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.571
Are you getting anything?

34:16.437 --> 34:17.572
Not yet.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.476
Fucking hell.

34:20.507 --> 34:22.310
It's a shame it's not scotch.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.147
Hang on.

34:26.181 --> 34:27.549
According to this,
there's a huge

34:27.581 --> 34:29.617
underground structure
right beneath us.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.587
And if my calculations
are correct...

34:35.456 --> 34:36.458
This...

34:37.125 --> 34:38.627
is the way in.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.964
Fucking hell, Merlin. Shit.

34:42.996 --> 34:44.533
You know, my mama...

34:45.299 --> 34:47.534
she always told me...

34:47.569 --> 34:51.106
us southerners get our good
manners from the British.

34:51.139 --> 34:54.243
I was thinkin',
ain't that a pity.

34:54.275 --> 34:56.344
Y'all didn't keep nothing
for yourselves.

35:03.352 --> 35:06.855
Y'all ain't never heard of
knocking before you enter?

35:06.888 --> 35:09.124
Well, actually we had
an invitation. Didn't we?

35:09.158 --> 35:10.292
Yeah.
Oh, did you now?

35:10.325 --> 35:13.261
Yeah. It came in the
shape of a bottle.

35:13.294 --> 35:15.162
We're from the Kingsman
tailor shop in London.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.731
Maybe you've heard of us?

35:16.765 --> 35:17.866
Oh, the Kingsman.

35:17.899 --> 35:20.167
Yeah.
Huh.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.580
That's where y'all got
them fine suits

35:21.604 --> 35:23.205
and them fancy
spectacles y'all got on?

35:23.238 --> 35:24.774
Exactly.
That's right.

35:24.807 --> 35:27.142
Y'all look damn sharp.

35:27.174 --> 35:28.520
Let me see
if I got it right, here.

35:28.544 --> 35:31.814
You want me to believe that
it's normal for a tailor...

35:31.846 --> 35:35.151
to hack through an advanced
biometric security system...

35:35.183 --> 35:37.720
with nothing but a little
bitty old watch on?

35:43.091 --> 35:44.892
I can promise you...

35:44.926 --> 35:46.028
that dog don't hunt.

35:46.062 --> 35:47.705
So why don't you go on and get down
on your knees...

35:47.729 --> 35:49.798
and tell me
who you really work for.

36:00.475 --> 36:03.178
That's 1963 Statesman Reserve.

36:03.212 --> 36:04.580
You just made it personal.

36:25.299 --> 36:27.569
Who the fuck are you?

36:38.113 --> 36:40.316
A bottle in a secret wall.

36:41.850 --> 36:44.053
You really expect me
to take that seriously?

36:45.520 --> 36:47.422
See, I think
your story's horse shit.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.892
Y'all just trying to cover
for a failed rescue mission.

36:50.926 --> 36:53.462
You here for the lepidopterist,
ain't you?

36:57.566 --> 37:00.002
Okay, so your
mystery bottle, huh?

37:02.705 --> 37:04.114
Look anything like that,
right there?

37:04.138 --> 37:06.408
Yes. Same brand,
much older.

37:06.942 --> 37:07.943
All right.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.745
Let's see here.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.315
You know why the measurement

37:13.348 --> 37:16.384
of alcohol content's
called "proof"?

37:16.419 --> 37:17.786
Oh, fuck off!

37:17.819 --> 37:20.654
Oh, for Pete's sake.

37:20.689 --> 37:22.524
See, comes from back
in the old days...

37:22.558 --> 37:25.094
when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

37:25.127 --> 37:27.529
They used to pour a little bit out
on gunpowder.

37:31.133 --> 37:33.401
That'll make you wanna slap
your mama right there, boy.

37:34.903 --> 37:35.803
And if the gunpowder,

37:35.837 --> 37:37.473
if it burnt when
they set it alight...

37:37.506 --> 37:39.208
they considered it proof...

37:39.241 --> 37:41.444
that their rum
was good and strong.

37:43.377 --> 37:45.914
But see, I ain't got
no gunpowder on me, do I?

37:47.850 --> 37:49.161
But I'm pretty sure
you boys'll make

37:49.185 --> 37:51.018
just as impressive of a sound...

37:51.051 --> 37:52.555
when I set your balls on fire.

37:56.825 --> 37:59.194
Or you could just tell me who the fuck
y'all really are...

37:59.227 --> 38:00.371
and how the hell y'all found us.

38:00.395 --> 38:01.830
Look, for the last time,

38:01.863 --> 38:04.332
we have nothing to protect
but our honor.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.201
So you can take
your cheap horse piss

38:06.234 --> 38:07.403
that you call whiskey...

38:07.435 --> 38:08.980
which, by the way,
is spelled without an "e"...

38:09.004 --> 38:11.440
and is nothing compared
to a single malt scotch...

38:11.473 --> 38:13.743
and you can go fuck yourself.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.912
What about you?

38:17.946 --> 38:19.080
Me?
Yeah.

38:19.114 --> 38:21.616
No, I love
a Jack and Coke, bruv.

38:21.649 --> 38:24.720
But I do agree with the part
where you go fuck yourself.

38:28.691 --> 38:29.524
All right.

38:29.558 --> 38:30.634
Y'all ain't got
nothing to protect

38:30.658 --> 38:31.893
other than your honor.

38:33.028 --> 38:35.131
Let's see what happens
when we change things up.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.873
Fuck me.
Harry?

38:44.906 --> 38:46.942
Y'all got three seconds
to tell me the truth.

38:46.975 --> 38:48.076
Wait. No.

38:48.109 --> 38:49.278
No!
Harry!

38:49.310 --> 38:51.212
He can't hear you.
But I can, so talk.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.347
No!
Get down, Harry!

38:53.381 --> 38:55.216
Harry! Harry!
That's two.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.518
Harry!
Harry!

38:56.551 --> 38:58.120
Harry!
Three.

38:58.153 --> 38:59.855
Stop!

39:00.522 --> 39:02.424
Their story checked out.

39:02.457 --> 39:04.492
I opened our doomsday
scenario locker

39:04.526 --> 39:06.428
and that umbrella was in it.

39:06.461 --> 39:09.665
Kingsman.
It's got our logo on it.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.166
I'm really sorry.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.836
My apologies, boys.

39:14.868 --> 39:16.971
I hope there ain't
no hard feelings.

39:17.004 --> 39:18.039
I was just doin' my job.

39:19.140 --> 39:20.374
Welcome to the Statesman,

39:20.408 --> 39:22.576
independent intelligence agency.

39:22.611 --> 39:23.912
Just like y'all, I reckon.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.113
But our founders went
into the booze business.

39:26.147 --> 39:27.227
Thank the sweet Lord above.

39:28.017 --> 39:29.116
This is Ginger Ale.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.884
She's our strategy executive.

39:30.919 --> 39:31.921
Hello.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.789
I'm Agent Tequila.

39:34.823 --> 39:36.759
This is the part
where you untie us.

39:40.328 --> 39:41.630
Thank you.

39:47.903 --> 39:49.004
Harry.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.506
Hello.
Hello, mate.

39:55.343 --> 39:56.946
Harry.

39:56.979 --> 39:58.047
How do you do?

39:59.180 --> 40:00.982
Have we met before?

40:01.015 --> 40:05.419
Harry, it's okay. It's fine.
They know that we know you.

40:05.453 --> 40:07.855
I think there must be
some mistake.

40:07.888 --> 40:10.591
It's been such
a long time, Harry.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.762
I need to get
my brogues resoled.

40:13.794 --> 40:16.631
Yeah, and my oxfords
are done in as well.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.968
Why are you telling me
about your shoes?

40:24.104 --> 40:25.206
I'm a lepidopterist.

40:26.140 --> 40:27.441
You're a what?

40:27.475 --> 40:29.010
I study butterflies.

40:33.015 --> 40:36.551
Well, you wanted to be before
you joined the army, but...

40:38.486 --> 40:39.955
Harry, look at me.

40:46.528 --> 40:47.897
It's good to see you.

40:49.031 --> 40:50.098
We'll be back soon.

40:50.131 --> 40:53.167
So these fellas right here
are our doomsday protocol?

40:53.201 --> 40:56.571
Turns out, our founder's
tailor was Kingsman.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.384
What the fuck
have you done to him?

41:00.408 --> 41:02.677
Nothing. Only tried
to help him.

41:02.711 --> 41:04.011
He's got retrograde amnesia.

41:04.046 --> 41:05.286
Now, we knew from his eyeglasses

41:05.314 --> 41:06.346
that he was intelligence.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.616
We just didn't know whose.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.318
How did he get here?

41:12.654 --> 41:14.723
What the hell?

41:14.756 --> 41:17.058
Tequila, I'm getting
a crazy spike...

41:17.091 --> 41:19.727
of extreme low frequency waves
11 miles from here.

41:19.761 --> 41:21.721
I'm gonna need you to
escort me there immediately.

41:49.723 --> 41:51.225
I need your alpha gel.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.763
I'll go check the church.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.446
We developed
our alpha gel technology

42:11.479 --> 42:12.680
for our own agents...

42:12.714 --> 42:14.482
in the event of a head shot.

42:14.515 --> 42:15.951
The gel protects the brain.

42:15.984 --> 42:18.587
Then, in the lab,
we use nanites...

42:18.620 --> 42:21.323
micro-bots,
to repair tissue damage.

42:27.863 --> 42:29.464
There are side effects.

42:29.497 --> 42:30.698
Partial amnesia...

42:30.732 --> 42:32.734
regression to the younger self.

42:32.767 --> 42:36.738
With no idea who he was,
there was nothing we could do.

42:37.672 --> 42:40.140
But now you guys are here...

42:40.174 --> 42:42.176
there's a good chance
we can bring him back.

43:10.439 --> 43:11.573
You're late.

43:11.607 --> 43:13.241
Why are you still wearing that?

43:13.274 --> 43:16.877
Until you get rid of
the perimeter landmines...

43:16.912 --> 43:19.314
I'll keep wearing the suit,
thank you very much.

43:19.348 --> 43:20.449
Scaredy-cat.

43:20.482 --> 43:21.783
Shut up and sit down.

43:21.816 --> 43:23.151
Let's go!

43:26.020 --> 43:28.390
Crocodile Rock, please.

43:30.258 --> 43:32.127
Fuck you!

43:34.062 --> 43:37.766
Hey, hey, Elton, language.

43:37.799 --> 43:41.036
Okay, as fabulous
as your catalogue is...

43:41.069 --> 43:43.605
I think I want to hear
some Gershwin.

43:45.906 --> 43:47.042
I still can't believe...

43:47.075 --> 43:49.578
you got away with
kidnapping Elton John.

43:49.611 --> 43:52.446
I know! But with Valentine
abducting those celebrities...

43:52.479 --> 43:55.383
it seemed silly not to take
advantage of the confusion.

43:56.984 --> 43:59.387
Shit. Has Elton
got the blue rash?

44:02.624 --> 44:03.658
Lights.

44:05.627 --> 44:07.562
Hey, Elton.

44:07.595 --> 44:09.596
Have you been a bad boy again?

44:09.629 --> 44:10.665
Mmm-mmm.

44:10.698 --> 44:13.167
You're lying.
Look at your hands.

44:16.770 --> 44:18.038
What is it?

44:18.071 --> 44:21.008
It's proof that my plan
is gonna work.

44:21.042 --> 44:25.279
It's also the first sign
of a slow and horrible death.

44:26.948 --> 44:29.218
Don't worry, I can fix it.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.886
Tell me who you partied with.

44:34.656 --> 44:36.225
It was Angel.

44:36.857 --> 44:40.827
Huh, not very angelic.

44:40.861 --> 44:42.497
Gonna have to clip his wings.

45:19.100 --> 45:21.035
Close the door behind you.

45:29.410 --> 45:31.912
At what point are you
going to start behaving

45:31.946 --> 45:33.814
like a Statesman, Tequila?

45:33.848 --> 45:36.384
You wanna go back
to being a rodeo clown?

45:36.417 --> 45:38.352
No, sir. I apologize, sir.

45:40.589 --> 45:42.424
I'm Champagne.

45:42.457 --> 45:44.926
But anyone who knows
what's good for him...

45:46.428 --> 45:47.962
calls me Champ.

45:48.763 --> 45:50.364
Sorry for your troubles.

45:51.131 --> 45:52.966
As your American cousins...

45:53.000 --> 45:58.207
I'm placing all of Statesman's considerably
larger resources at your disposal.

46:00.808 --> 46:03.477
Can you imagine us
in the clothing business?

46:06.948 --> 46:09.150
Now, how can I help you?

46:09.183 --> 46:11.086
First of all,
I've got to thank you

46:11.118 --> 46:12.687
for saving Agent Galahad.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.888
Wait.

46:13.921 --> 46:15.789
You said that you were Galahad.

46:15.823 --> 46:18.125
Oh, no, he's talking
about the butterfly guy.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.828
That used to be his handle.
Oh.

46:19.861 --> 46:20.995
Galahad always said,

46:21.029 --> 46:22.239
"You've got to look at
the bigger picture..."

46:22.263 --> 46:24.297
"ask 'why' as well as 'who'."

46:24.332 --> 46:26.334
So if someone wanted
to take out Kingsman...

46:26.368 --> 46:28.536
then they've got to be
planning something major.

46:28.569 --> 46:29.836
So what do you know?

46:29.870 --> 46:31.238
They're a drug cartel, we think.

46:31.272 --> 46:33.642
The name Golden Circle
keeps coming up.

46:33.674 --> 46:36.109
Mmm. We'll look
into them. What else?

46:36.143 --> 46:38.712
One of our former trainees
is working with them.

46:38.747 --> 46:41.348
Charlie Hesketh.
Total prick.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.651
You got any promising
leads on him?

46:43.685 --> 46:44.819
His ex-girlfriend.

46:44.852 --> 46:47.821
I've been tracking her
through social media.

46:47.854 --> 46:51.225
We believe she's still
in contact with him.

46:51.258 --> 46:54.996
And she's going
to Glastonbury Music Festival.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.098
Oh, good.

46:58.133 --> 47:00.468
Agent Tequila,
break out your dancing shoes.

47:00.502 --> 47:01.736
You have a new mission.

47:01.770 --> 47:03.071
Yes, sir.

47:03.839 --> 47:05.040
Hold up.

47:07.442 --> 47:08.409
You feeling okay?

47:08.442 --> 47:11.446
I'm a little tired,
but fine, thanks.

47:11.479 --> 47:12.613
Galahad, you ready?

47:12.647 --> 47:13.748
Your face...

47:13.781 --> 47:15.150
You got...

47:17.886 --> 47:19.921
What the fuck?

47:19.953 --> 47:21.589
Oh, shit.

47:22.790 --> 47:23.990
Head to the sick bay.

47:24.024 --> 47:26.528
Have Ginger check you out.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.463
Hey, give him your glasses.

47:33.734 --> 47:36.104
You're in luck, kid.
Put 'em on.

47:37.171 --> 47:39.005
You get our finest senior agent

47:39.040 --> 47:40.975
to join you instead.

47:41.008 --> 47:43.577
Right now,
he's in our New York office.

47:43.611 --> 47:46.214
Galahad, meet Agent Whiskey.

47:48.716 --> 47:50.151
Kid...

47:50.185 --> 47:53.755
looks like we're hookin' up
with a chick at a rock concert.

47:53.788 --> 47:55.857
My favorite kind of mission.

47:55.890 --> 47:58.326
I'm sending my jet
to pick you up.

48:09.337 --> 48:12.341
We've dealt with
this kind of amnesia before.

48:12.374 --> 48:16.011
Harry's like a computer
that needs to be rebooted.

48:17.312 --> 48:21.116
We need to recreate a shock
or trauma from his past...

48:21.149 --> 48:22.517
to trigger his memory.

48:24.051 --> 48:25.386
I hope you're right.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.364
Uh, excuse me.

48:36.397 --> 48:39.100
There seems to be
some sort of a problem here.

48:39.133 --> 48:41.770
Help! Somebody!

48:41.803 --> 48:45.107
What the hell is
going on? Help me!

48:47.942 --> 48:49.177
Help!

48:50.877 --> 48:52.013
Oh, God!

48:52.046 --> 48:54.316
Stop! Fuck!

49:15.537 --> 49:16.638
Get him out now.

49:16.671 --> 49:18.607
No, no, wait. His instincts
are gonna kick in.

49:30.819 --> 49:32.421
No. I'm sorry to do this.

49:53.374 --> 49:55.609
Are you okay?
What happened?

49:55.642 --> 49:58.211
Harry, you've forgotten
who you are.

49:58.245 --> 50:01.648
We thought this might
jog your memory.

50:01.683 --> 50:04.752
Look, when you were young,
you had a choice.

50:04.785 --> 50:07.521
To either be a lepidopterist
or to join the army.

50:07.555 --> 50:10.357
You chose the army.
That led to Kingsman.

50:10.390 --> 50:13.360
You became a Kingsman agent.

50:13.395 --> 50:14.829
I doubt whether
I'd work for anyone

50:14.863 --> 50:15.943
who drowns their employees.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.232
I want to go home.

50:18.265 --> 50:19.867
I want my butterfly collection.

50:21.169 --> 50:22.703
I want to see Mother.

50:24.238 --> 50:26.374
There's nothing more we can do.

50:27.774 --> 50:29.343
It's time to let him go.

50:39.053 --> 50:40.531
Babe, I wish
I could stay longer,

50:40.555 --> 50:42.190
but I've got to go on
with this mission.

50:42.223 --> 50:45.326
Wait, wait, wait.

50:45.359 --> 50:47.863
Before you go,
I wanna show you something.

50:50.131 --> 50:51.199
Aw!

50:51.232 --> 50:53.768
I know he could
never replace JB...

50:53.801 --> 50:55.203
but...

50:57.171 --> 50:59.339
Oh, my days.

50:59.374 --> 51:01.609
I hoped he might make you happy.

51:04.578 --> 51:07.214
And give you another reason
to come back home soon.

51:07.948 --> 51:09.282
I love him.

51:09.317 --> 51:11.419
But I don't need another
reason to come home.

51:18.359 --> 51:22.230
I apologize.
Just waiting for my friend.

51:22.263 --> 51:24.165
I'll be back as soon
as I can, I promise.

51:25.899 --> 51:28.001
Got to go save the world?
Yep.

51:28.035 --> 51:29.837
Well, if you save the world...

51:31.038 --> 51:32.807
you know what that means.

51:32.841 --> 51:34.476
Yeah, all right.

51:37.745 --> 51:38.747
Bye, buddy.

51:45.151 --> 51:46.687
Got the passes from my contact.

51:47.555 --> 51:49.524
You're gonna love Glastonbury.

51:50.457 --> 51:52.459
Well, that's the easy part, kid.

51:52.493 --> 51:54.596
Take a look in the glove box.

51:58.966 --> 52:00.334
Fucking hell, bruv.

52:00.368 --> 52:02.803
Thought everything
was supposed to be bigger in America.

52:02.837 --> 52:05.239
Is this why you overcompensate
with these massive cars?

52:05.272 --> 52:07.040
Goes on your finger.

52:07.075 --> 52:08.451
The surveillance tracker
is in the tip.

52:08.475 --> 52:11.845
Apply light pressure for three
seconds to release it.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.287
Okay, so according
to her Instagram feed...

52:20.321 --> 52:23.290
Charlie's ex-girlfriend
is up ahead at the VIP bar.

52:23.323 --> 52:25.158
Which one of us is gonna
plant the tracker?

52:25.192 --> 52:26.528
Bands, boys.

52:27.261 --> 52:29.297
Yeah, that's fine.

52:29.330 --> 52:32.033
I say we both
make an approach...

52:32.066 --> 52:33.968
whoever gets on best,
goes for it.

52:34.002 --> 52:35.612
Well, it doesn't have
to be a competition, bruv.

52:35.636 --> 52:37.005
Why don't we just
go up to her...

52:37.038 --> 52:38.315
shake her hand,
pat her on the back,

52:38.339 --> 52:40.475
whatever, you know.
Job done.

52:40.508 --> 52:43.678
The hand is not
a mucous membrane, Eggsy.

52:43.712 --> 52:45.646
Neither is the back.

52:45.678 --> 52:47.480
They teach you anything
at Kingsman?

52:47.515 --> 52:48.950
What are you talking about?

52:48.982 --> 52:51.685
Our trackers are designed
to enter the bloodstream.

52:51.718 --> 52:55.055
They circulate harmlessly,
providing full audio and GPS.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.257
Mucus membrane.

52:56.290 --> 52:57.959
That's like up the nose,
isn't it?

52:57.991 --> 52:59.928
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Stick my finger...

53:03.797 --> 53:06.000
It's not just inside
the nose, is it?

53:06.033 --> 53:09.037
No, Eggsy, it ain't.
Fuck.

53:09.069 --> 53:10.904
All right,
I'll take the first crack.

53:10.937 --> 53:12.640
Watch and learn, buddy.

53:15.308 --> 53:16.711
Good luck.

53:22.517 --> 53:24.417
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you.

53:24.450 --> 53:25.586
Miss, I beg your pardon.

53:25.620 --> 53:27.888
Now, I don't wanna pester you...

53:27.921 --> 53:29.921
but I just have to know,
what time are you playing?

53:30.957 --> 53:32.593
I'm not in a band.

53:32.627 --> 53:34.094
Oh, God.
Who did you think I was?

53:34.127 --> 53:35.528
Please don't say
someone ghastly.

53:35.562 --> 53:38.232
God damn it,
now I feel like a fool.

53:38.265 --> 53:42.636
I just assumed that a woman
with your charisma...

53:42.669 --> 53:44.805
well, she just had
to be somebody.

53:44.839 --> 53:45.974
Right.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.575
Thank you.

53:47.607 --> 53:49.109
No, it's okay.
I know you didn't mean

53:49.142 --> 53:50.410
to make me feel
like a dumb-ass.

53:50.444 --> 53:51.684
So I'll let you make it up to me

53:51.712 --> 53:53.547
by letting me buy you a drink.

53:54.214 --> 53:55.549
Follow my finger.

54:00.053 --> 54:02.088
What are we doing?

54:02.122 --> 54:04.157
Swiping to the left.

54:04.191 --> 54:06.294
What, you don't do
Tinder in America?

54:06.326 --> 54:07.662
Tinder what?

54:07.694 --> 54:10.698
Do you know, I think it's
probably a generational thing.

54:10.730 --> 54:13.701
It translates as
"Go away, old man."

54:17.104 --> 54:18.339
Be good, be cool.

54:18.772 --> 54:19.841
Bye.

54:21.274 --> 54:23.110
Thank you for that.

54:23.143 --> 54:25.279
I'm Clara.
River.

54:25.312 --> 54:28.281
Bloody hell, is that the time?

54:28.314 --> 54:29.426
You know what, I'm so jetlagged

54:29.450 --> 54:31.384
I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

54:31.419 --> 54:32.987
Where've you been?
Anywhere nice?

54:33.020 --> 54:36.290
South America. Been spending
a bit of time out there.

54:36.323 --> 54:37.558
Training with the shaman,

54:37.591 --> 54:39.827
and trying to really connect
with my spirit animal.

54:39.861 --> 54:41.996
Yeah.
I'm a crow.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.732
And, hang on, let me guess...

54:43.765 --> 54:45.366
No.
Jaguar.

54:45.399 --> 54:47.502
What? No! Oh, my God!

54:47.535 --> 54:49.604
Yes?
How did you even know that?

54:49.636 --> 54:52.305
Look, it totally is.
Check it out.

54:52.339 --> 54:54.941
Oh. Ino Moxo.
Black jaguar. Very nice.

54:54.975 --> 54:58.145
You know what?
I wanna buy you a drink.

55:06.854 --> 55:08.790
Eggsy sent this
from Glastonbury.

55:10.823 --> 55:14.395
And #bluerash is
trending on Twitter.

55:14.428 --> 55:16.730
Have you found any correlation
between these cases?

55:16.763 --> 55:18.865
Only recreational drug use.

55:18.899 --> 55:19.933
Ah.

55:21.236 --> 55:23.171
I know.
Not very Statesman-like.

55:23.904 --> 55:25.605
Tequila here...

55:25.640 --> 55:28.842
he is our resident bad boy.

55:28.875 --> 55:30.343
You don't think
this could be related

55:30.377 --> 55:32.546
to The Golden Circle, do you?

55:32.580 --> 55:36.482
A drug cartel
poisoning its customers?

55:36.517 --> 55:37.819
Doesn't make sense.

55:38.151 --> 55:39.520
Mmm.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.895
Poppy, would you
pass the sugar, please?

55:47.428 --> 55:49.096
Okay.

55:49.129 --> 55:52.834
But it's really bad for you.

55:52.866 --> 55:55.903
Eight times more addictive
than cocaine.

55:55.937 --> 55:58.573
Five times more likely
to cause death.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.241
But it's legal...

56:00.274 --> 56:02.576
so, you go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

56:03.877 --> 56:07.013
Don't get me started
on tobacco and alcohol.

56:07.047 --> 56:09.450
Peddle that stuff
and you're in Fortune 500.

56:09.482 --> 56:11.118
But me? No!

56:11.151 --> 56:12.553
I'm out here hiding

56:12.587 --> 56:15.256
in the middle of
nowhere. Homesick.

56:15.288 --> 56:16.656
Because I sell drugs.

56:16.689 --> 56:20.193
Oh, Pops. You're doing this
because you're homesick?

56:20.227 --> 56:21.929
Yes.

56:21.962 --> 56:24.231
I want freedom.

56:24.265 --> 56:26.167
I want fame.

56:26.200 --> 56:29.569
Our profits were
250 billion dollars last year.

56:29.604 --> 56:31.080
I am the most successful
businesswoman

56:31.104 --> 56:33.240
in the world,
but nobody knows who I am.

56:33.274 --> 56:34.409
Pops, Pops.

56:34.442 --> 56:36.377
It's not long now, eh?

56:36.410 --> 56:38.345
You're right, thank you.

56:38.377 --> 56:39.747
Sorry to interrupt you.

56:39.779 --> 56:42.415
You wanted to see me,
Madam Poppy?

56:42.448 --> 56:45.485
Yes, Angel.
In The Golden Circle...

56:45.518 --> 56:47.687
we do not sample
the merchandise...

56:47.721 --> 56:50.725
and we do not break the rules.

56:50.758 --> 56:53.493
Which is why I have
invested in robots...

56:53.528 --> 56:55.863
because they are
so much more reliable

56:55.895 --> 56:58.198
and trustworthy
than human beings.

57:06.439 --> 57:07.642
Oh!

57:28.062 --> 57:29.797
Oh! Oh, no. Whoa! Whoa!

57:46.779 --> 57:49.149
Sorry we never
found your friends.

57:49.183 --> 57:51.385
Well, we all go on
our separate journeys...

57:51.419 --> 57:53.054
but, ultimately,
we'll all arrive

57:53.087 --> 57:54.655
at the same destination.

57:54.687 --> 57:57.723
Shall we check my tent?
See if they're there?

57:57.758 --> 58:00.028
Uh... Yeah.
Oh, come on.

58:05.098 --> 58:06.600
Wow.

58:06.633 --> 58:08.268
This is amazing.

58:09.904 --> 58:11.338
Come on.

58:11.372 --> 58:14.408
Uh, you know what, I'm busting
for a pee actually.

58:14.441 --> 58:16.143
You could do it on me
if you want.

58:16.944 --> 58:18.046
Uh...

58:18.712 --> 58:20.047
Maybe in a bit.

58:20.781 --> 58:22.448
Give me a sec, yeah?

58:22.482 --> 58:24.986
Okay, but hurry up, River.

58:25.018 --> 58:27.988
Been waiting all night for you
to at least kiss me.

58:34.928 --> 58:35.830
Hey!

58:35.863 --> 58:38.832
Hi, babe.
Uh, bit of a nightmare.

58:38.866 --> 58:40.201
I've got to sleep
with a target...

58:40.234 --> 58:42.936
but I won't do it, unless
you agree that it's all right.

58:42.970 --> 58:45.506
You've got
to be fucking kidding.

58:45.538 --> 58:47.341
What was I, target practice?

58:47.374 --> 58:49.877
Babe, surely it's better that
I'm honest with you...

58:49.910 --> 58:51.621
rather than me doing it
and not telling you.

58:51.645 --> 58:54.480
Kind of got a bit of
a "save the world" situation here.

58:54.515 --> 58:56.384
How the fuck is screwing someone

58:56.417 --> 58:58.018
gonna save the world?

58:58.051 --> 58:59.953
Well, it's a bit complicated...

58:59.986 --> 59:02.923
but trust me, I would not be
doing it if I didn't have to.

59:06.060 --> 59:08.495
Babe, please believe me.
I love you.

59:08.529 --> 59:09.739
You are the person I wanna spend

59:09.763 --> 59:11.031
the rest of my life with.

59:13.100 --> 59:14.334
Is that a proposal?

59:16.403 --> 59:17.571
Um...

59:17.604 --> 59:19.439
Because I think I'd give you
my permission.

59:19.473 --> 59:23.277
Having that security, knowing
that we were committed...

59:23.310 --> 59:26.279
In that context, yeah.
Yeah, I'd feel different.

59:27.348 --> 59:29.317
Right. Well, I mean...

59:29.350 --> 59:30.484
I want to be with you,

59:30.517 --> 59:32.118
but being
a public figure, babe...

59:32.153 --> 59:33.388
like a prince...

59:34.388 --> 59:35.565
It's a bit of a factor,
you know,

59:35.589 --> 59:36.891
what with my job and stuff.

59:38.524 --> 59:40.694
Oh, no, no, no, come on. Okay.

59:40.727 --> 59:42.762
Uh, look, we need to talk
about this properly.

59:42.796 --> 59:44.898
Just give me five minutes, okay?

59:45.799 --> 59:48.502
Don't put yourself down, Eggsy.

59:48.535 --> 59:50.771
I'm sure you can last
longer than that.

01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:19.667
What's the matter?
Nothing.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.100
I just feel that
our spirit animals

01:00:21.134 --> 01:00:22.803
need more time to get in sync...

01:00:22.837 --> 01:00:26.206
and find a harmonious bond
on the spiritual plane.

01:00:26.238 --> 01:00:27.441
Totally.

01:00:27.473 --> 01:00:28.841
Yeah?

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.379
Or we could just...

01:00:32.645 --> 01:00:33.948
fuck?

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.022
Clara, I don't think I can.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.765
But you know what?

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:55.268
My crow is looking
for a place to nest.

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:40.446
Good work, Eggsy!

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.848
Tracker fully functional.

01:01:44.051 --> 01:01:46.921
Don't worry, I've been
through this with Whiskey before.

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:49.322
Nice to be working with an agent

01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:51.091
who knows what he's doing.

01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:55.696
Wow, Mr. Crow. My turn.

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:57.597
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:58.899
I'm in a relationship.

01:01:58.933 --> 01:02:01.302
That's adorable.
Listen, so am I.

01:02:01.334 --> 01:02:05.071
What happens at Glasto,
stays in Glasto.

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:06.907
I can't.

01:02:07.374 --> 01:02:08.442
Bye, Clara.

01:02:13.913 --> 01:02:15.114
This is Princess T,

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.450
please leave a message.

01:02:18.685 --> 01:02:19.996
Motor Manor Hotel...

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.221
Yeah, can you put me through
to Princess Tilde, please.

01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:24.958
Oh, actually, sir, I'm just
looking at my computer...

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.526
and I'm afraid that the princess

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.728
is already checked out.

01:02:27.761 --> 01:02:28.963
Thank you.

01:02:31.598 --> 01:02:32.600
Fuck!

01:02:59.759 --> 01:03:00.962
Harry.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.298
What's going on?
I was just packing.

01:03:05.332 --> 01:03:06.532
Look at these lovely toiletries

01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:08.835
Merlin very kindly gave me
as a leaving present.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.104
Here, try this aftershave.

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:12.973
Yeah, I know, Harry.
I'm wearing it.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.245
Listen, you can't just give up.

01:03:18.444 --> 01:03:19.613
Give up?

01:03:19.647 --> 01:03:22.750
No, on the contrary.
I'm about to achieve my dream.

01:03:22.783 --> 01:03:24.017
Researching rare butterflies

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:26.487
alongside some of the finest
minds in entomology.

01:03:36.196 --> 01:03:39.834
You know, you may as well
have me stuck up on this wall.

01:03:39.866 --> 01:03:43.470
'Cause you're never gonna find a butterfly
more interesting than me.

01:03:43.504 --> 01:03:44.604
Sorry?

01:03:44.638 --> 01:03:49.109
When you and I first met,
I was just, like, a maggot.

01:03:49.142 --> 01:03:50.511
Maggots turn into flies.

01:03:50.544 --> 01:03:52.112
Perhaps you mean larva.

01:03:52.145 --> 01:03:54.080
Larva, yeah, okay.
Whatever. The point is...

01:03:54.113 --> 01:03:56.182
everyone wanted to squash me.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:58.785
But not you.

01:03:58.819 --> 01:04:01.889
You helped me
to become a caterpillar.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.523
And now I've got wings.

01:04:04.491 --> 01:04:06.526
I'm flying higher
than I ever dreamed.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.362
And that is all thanks to you.

01:04:08.395 --> 01:04:10.430
I hate to seem rude,
but I need to finish packing

01:04:10.464 --> 01:04:11.632
and get some sleep.

01:04:11.665 --> 01:04:13.066
Harry, you can't just walk away.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.668
Kingsman needs you.

01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:17.004
The whole world needs you.

01:04:19.805 --> 01:04:21.374
I need you.

01:04:22.243 --> 01:04:24.478
Eggy, whoever the Harry was

01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:27.014
that you knew,
he's gone, I'm afraid.

01:04:27.379 --> 01:04:28.448
Goodbye.

01:05:07.587 --> 01:05:08.888
That's not a martini.

01:05:08.921 --> 01:05:10.857
It is in Kentucky.

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:12.093
Fair enough.

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:21.836
Here's to you, Eggsy.

01:05:21.868 --> 01:05:24.238
You're exactly
what Kingsman needs.

01:05:34.915 --> 01:05:36.149
This is Princess T.

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:37.618
Please leave a message.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.956
Can I have
another martini, please?

01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:44.392
Sure.

01:05:45.392 --> 01:05:46.460
Thanks.

01:06:00.473 --> 01:06:01.575
Give up.

01:06:36.509 --> 01:06:37.977
You know what?

01:06:38.011 --> 01:06:40.314
That was the best martini
I've ever had.

01:06:41.448 --> 01:06:42.816
Keep the change.

01:06:42.848 --> 01:06:44.117
Thanks.

01:06:58.631 --> 01:06:59.909
It's all right.
Don't panic.

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:02.670
Just thought I'd bring you
a little leaving present.

01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:09.652
What do you think?
He's lovely, isn't he?

01:07:10.877 --> 01:07:12.412
Would you like to hold him?

01:07:15.482 --> 01:07:16.650
Hello.

01:07:25.558 --> 01:07:27.794
Do you think I should shoot him?

01:07:27.828 --> 01:07:30.297
Are you quite mad?
What? What's the problem?

01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:32.432
No! You can't!
Eh? What?

01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:34.668
No, you'll have to shoot me!
Shoot you?

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:35.601
Well, I will shoot you.

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:37.112
No. No one's sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.181
Well, what about you, Harry?

01:07:38.205 --> 01:07:39.616
You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.741
Do you remember?

01:08:03.263 --> 01:08:05.198
You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

01:08:33.091 --> 01:08:35.028
It was a blank.
Yes, Harry. Yes!

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.129
It was a fucking blank!

01:08:36.162 --> 01:08:37.206
That's right. It was a blank!

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:38.499
I would never hurt Mr. Pickle!

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.366
Yes, Harry!
He lived to a ripe old age!

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:41.868
He died of pancreatitis!

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.743
You're not Mr. Pickle.

01:08:56.948 --> 01:08:57.951
Eggsy.

01:08:59.919 --> 01:09:01.386
Hello, Harry.

01:09:13.866 --> 01:09:15.401
Eggsy.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.140
Valentine has to be stopped.
No, I know.

01:09:22.176 --> 01:09:23.385
He has a device.
It's all right.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.278
It's sorted. Don't worry.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:27.314
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.283
Well, well.

01:09:30.316 --> 01:09:32.551
I suppose I should
cancel that taxi.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.688
Yes.

01:09:34.721 --> 01:09:35.990
If you don't mind...

01:09:37.723 --> 01:09:38.926
Merlin.

01:09:40.792 --> 01:09:42.828
Welcome back...

01:09:42.863 --> 01:09:43.962
Galahad.

01:09:48.701 --> 01:09:50.645
Now that we've finished
the debrief, Harry...

01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:52.537
here's a couple of
welcome back gifts.

01:09:52.573 --> 01:09:54.207
First up...

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.208
a brand-new Kingsman watch.

01:09:56.241 --> 01:09:57.377
Advanced software,

01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:59.479
it can hack into anything
with a microchip.

01:09:59.512 --> 01:10:00.879
It is the bollocks.

01:10:00.914 --> 01:10:02.382
And Merlin...

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:03.616
I made you these.

01:10:07.052 --> 01:10:08.354
A-ha.

01:10:26.506 --> 01:10:29.075
Thank you, Merlin, Eggsy.

01:10:29.109 --> 01:10:31.211
How do I look?
You look...

01:10:31.244 --> 01:10:35.048
Like some faggot lookin' for
an eye fuckin'.

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:38.083
Now...

01:10:38.118 --> 01:10:41.321
why don't you
get out of our bar...

01:10:41.354 --> 01:10:44.258
before I take out
your other one?

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:46.159
Now, is that any way
to welcome a visitor

01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:48.028
from out of town, moonshine?

01:10:48.061 --> 01:10:49.463
Okay.

01:10:50.629 --> 01:10:53.266
Suck my southern dick...

01:10:53.299 --> 01:10:55.134
bitch.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.604
Oh, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

01:10:58.872 --> 01:11:00.406
Good day, sir.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.178
Well?

01:11:06.213 --> 01:11:08.048
What are you ladies waitin' for?

01:11:08.615 --> 01:11:09.917
Manners...

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:12.752
maketh...

01:11:15.289 --> 01:11:16.690
man.

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:19.959
Do you know what that means?

01:11:22.162 --> 01:11:24.097
Then let me teach you a lesson.

01:11:34.539 --> 01:11:36.441
Are we going to stand
around here all day?

01:11:36.476 --> 01:11:37.877
Or are we going to...

01:11:39.479 --> 01:11:41.448
You big...

01:11:59.531 --> 01:12:01.467
Well, pick him up.

01:12:01.502 --> 01:12:04.972
Now, that is not what I call
a Kentucky welcome.

01:12:07.007 --> 01:12:11.143
Manners maketh man.

01:12:11.177 --> 01:12:12.579
Let me translate that for you.

01:12:32.397 --> 01:12:33.566
What's wrong with me, Merlin?

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.734
I thought you fixed me?

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.037
Well, we rebuilt
your neural pathways.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:39.372
But it'll take time to get
your coordination back.

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:01.794
And the phantom butterflies?

01:13:01.828 --> 01:13:03.562
You will experience episodes...

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:04.830
lapses of clarity.

01:13:04.864 --> 01:13:06.933
You'll be back to normal soon.

01:13:22.048 --> 01:13:24.051
Whoo.

01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:26.586
I feel like a tornado
in a trailer park.

01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:31.524
♪ Golden Circle proudly presents ♪

01:13:31.556 --> 01:13:34.526
Mr. President,
my name is Poppy Adams.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.763
I believe the UN has no teeth.

01:13:37.798 --> 01:13:39.608
So I've selected you,
as leader of the free world,

01:13:39.632 --> 01:13:41.500
to receive this communication.

01:13:41.534 --> 01:13:43.202
And I invite you
to begin negotiations...

01:13:43.235 --> 01:13:47.272
on the largest scale
hostage situation in history.

01:13:47.306 --> 01:13:48.507
A few weeks ago,

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.343
an engineered virus
was released...

01:13:50.377 --> 01:13:53.178
contained in all
varieties of my product.

01:13:53.213 --> 01:13:57.683
Cannabis, cocaine, heroin,
opium, ecstasy...

01:13:57.717 --> 01:13:59.119
...and crystal meth.

01:14:00.387 --> 01:14:03.023
Some of you
are already infected.

01:14:03.056 --> 01:14:05.092
And this is what you can expect

01:14:05.124 --> 01:14:07.025
in the coming days.

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.062
After a brief
incubation period...

01:14:10.096 --> 01:14:12.065
victims present
with stage one symptoms.

01:14:13.432 --> 01:14:14.634
A blue rash.

01:14:15.567 --> 01:14:16.668
Next...

01:14:16.701 --> 01:14:18.704
second stage symptoms appear.

01:14:18.738 --> 01:14:20.507
Mania...

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.174
as the virus enters the brain.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.544
Very distressing to the victim

01:14:24.576 --> 01:14:26.312
and those around them.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.781
Stage three...

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:31.183
Paralysis.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:34.087
Muscles enter a state
of catastrophic seizure.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.989
And once the muscles of
the thorax become affected...

01:14:37.024 --> 01:14:39.593
breathing becomes impossible...

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:43.963
leading to a very nasty death
within 12 hours.

01:14:45.766 --> 01:14:50.970
But I have good news to
the millions already affected.

01:14:51.003 --> 01:14:52.738
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:14:52.772 --> 01:14:56.043
I have an antidote.

01:15:10.824 --> 01:15:14.061
What have you done to me,
you fucking bitch?

01:15:15.962 --> 01:15:17.696
100% effective...

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.466
and ready to ship out worldwide

01:15:19.498 --> 01:15:21.100
at a moment's notice.

01:15:21.133 --> 01:15:23.336
Get out of my room!
You have my word.

01:15:23.369 --> 01:15:25.038
Get out!
I will do this...

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:28.640
if the following
conditions are met.

01:15:28.674 --> 01:15:31.345
Get out of my fucking room!

01:15:32.579 --> 01:15:35.415
First, you agree
to end the war on drugs,

01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:36.848
once and for all.

01:15:36.882 --> 01:15:39.586
All classes of substance
are legalized...

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.588
paving the way
to a new marketplace

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.690
in which sales
are regulated and taxed...

01:15:44.723 --> 01:15:46.124
as per alcohol.

01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:51.464
And second, my colleagues and
I receive full legal immunity.

01:15:51.497 --> 01:15:52.632
Meet my terms...

01:15:52.664 --> 01:15:53.809
and I look forward
to helping you

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:55.935
keep our beloved
country great...

01:15:55.967 --> 01:15:57.302
boosting our ailing economy,

01:15:57.337 --> 01:16:00.473
and easing spending
on law enforcement.

01:16:00.507 --> 01:16:02.843
Or continue this
blinkered, outmoded...

01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:06.812
and, frankly, disastrous
exercise in prohibition...

01:16:06.846 --> 01:16:09.116
and live with blood
on your hands.

01:16:10.182 --> 01:16:12.718
Save lives. Legalize.

01:16:18.257 --> 01:16:21.060
I told you that shit
was no good for you.

01:16:29.936 --> 01:16:31.738
Who is Poppy Adams?

01:16:31.771 --> 01:16:33.507
After graduating
Harvard Business School...

01:16:33.539 --> 01:16:34.873
Adams was briefly held

01:16:34.908 --> 01:16:36.776
for serious mental
health issues...

01:16:36.808 --> 01:16:38.845
before disappearing
without a trace.

01:16:38.878 --> 01:16:41.547
Intelligent, ambitious,
ruthless,

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:45.083
lacks empathy,
superficial charm.

01:16:45.118 --> 01:16:48.721
All the elements of a great CEO.

01:16:48.753 --> 01:16:51.190
Or a psychopath.

01:16:51.223 --> 01:16:52.225
Following the broadcast

01:16:52.258 --> 01:16:53.826
of Adams's message
to the president...

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.029
there were scenes
of chaos today...

01:16:56.061 --> 01:16:58.664
at medical centers
across the country and around the world.

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:00.009
We have no more beds available.

01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:03.102
The hospital is
at full capacity.

01:17:03.136 --> 01:17:04.704
The blue rash
is now being renamed

01:17:04.738 --> 01:17:06.004
"The Dancing Disease"...

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:09.442
as victims begin to exhibit
stage two symptoms.

01:17:15.281 --> 01:17:17.016
Let's prep the cryo unit.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.351
You want to freeze him?

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:19.752
Exactly.

01:17:19.785 --> 01:17:20.986
Victims of the virus

01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:23.556
caused by contaminated
recreational drugs...

01:17:23.589 --> 01:17:27.526
flooded hospitals and clinics
in fear for their lives.

01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:32.073
Curfews and no travel orders

01:17:32.097 --> 01:17:34.066
are being considered
as authorities assess

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:35.802
the scale of the disaster.

01:17:36.201 --> 01:17:37.870
Close it.

01:17:39.271 --> 01:17:40.772
But there has still been

01:17:40.806 --> 01:17:42.808
no official response
from the president...

01:17:42.842 --> 01:17:45.879
who remains locked
in emergency talks.

01:17:47.613 --> 01:17:50.249
Prepare a presidential decree.

01:17:50.283 --> 01:17:52.618
Tell intelligence and law enforcement
to stand down.

01:17:52.651 --> 01:17:54.753
We're gonna dance
to this lady's tune.

01:17:54.788 --> 01:17:55.888
Good.

01:17:55.922 --> 01:17:58.057
We can make this work.

01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.491
We spin it
that it's not a matter

01:17:59.525 --> 01:18:00.826
of negotiation with terrorists.

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.829
No, what I'm proposing...

01:18:02.861 --> 01:18:05.730
is we appear
to agree to her demands

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:07.167
to prevent global panic...

01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:12.570
and then let the junkie scum
go down in flames. Huh?

01:18:14.673 --> 01:18:16.609
Huh? Yeah.

01:18:16.641 --> 01:18:20.612
Take Poppy Adams and her so-called
Golden Circle down with them.

01:18:20.646 --> 01:18:25.317
No drug users, no drug trade.
It's a win-win situation here.

01:18:25.351 --> 01:18:28.720
But, sir, we're not talking about
a handful of hostages.

01:18:28.753 --> 01:18:30.222
We could be looking
at the deaths

01:18:30.256 --> 01:18:32.092
of hundreds
of millions worldwide.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.402
Hundreds of millions
of criminals,

01:18:33.426 --> 01:18:34.861
burdens to society.

01:18:35.695 --> 01:18:37.197
Am I right, McCoy?

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:38.364
Absolutely, sir.

01:18:38.397 --> 01:18:40.199
But, sir, that's...

01:18:40.232 --> 01:18:42.869
What about people who were
just experimenting?

01:18:42.901 --> 01:18:44.837
Folks who self-medicate?

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:47.772
Functioning
professionals? Kids?

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.541
Oh, spare me the crap, Fox.

01:18:49.574 --> 01:18:50.976
The fact is,

01:18:51.009 --> 01:18:54.047
this presidency has just
won the war on drugs.

01:18:54.079 --> 01:18:55.314
Congratulations, sir.

01:18:55.882 --> 01:18:57.817
Thank you.

01:18:59.785 --> 01:19:02.888
And that deserves a toast.

01:19:02.923 --> 01:19:05.525
This is totally unethical, sir.

01:19:05.557 --> 01:19:07.259
Fox, shut up!

01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:10.096
McCoy, declare martial law.

01:19:10.129 --> 01:19:12.832
We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,

01:19:12.865 --> 01:19:14.767
schools, civic centers...

01:19:14.801 --> 01:19:16.201
order a press blackout.

01:19:16.235 --> 01:19:18.071
And put the military on standby

01:19:18.104 --> 01:19:20.140
to round these junkies up.

01:19:21.074 --> 01:19:22.842
Whether they broke
the law or not,

01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:25.145
those victims are human beings.

01:19:27.413 --> 01:19:28.415
Tequila.

01:19:29.615 --> 01:19:31.151
He's a great guy.

01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:34.419
And a great agent.

01:19:34.453 --> 01:19:38.223
Right now, he's lying in deep
freeze waitin' on our help.

01:19:38.257 --> 01:19:40.659
We can't make
this personal, sir.

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:41.961
Personal?

01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:44.897
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.467
These people,
we're their only hope.

01:19:49.235 --> 01:19:51.071
Now, we have
to find that antidote.

01:19:51.104 --> 01:19:53.707
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.675
She must have some on hand.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.277
Locate Poppy...

01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:01.146
and obtain a sample
for analysis.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.048
Maybe it can be replicated.

01:20:03.082 --> 01:20:04.549
Sorry to cut in, guys.

01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:06.127
But Charlie is on the phone
with his girlfriend.

01:20:06.151 --> 01:20:08.386
Looping you in now.

01:20:08.419 --> 01:20:09.989
Don't worry.
I'm on a payphone...

01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:12.624
covered in a fucking blue rash.

01:20:12.658 --> 01:20:13.959
Why didn't you tell me?

01:20:13.993 --> 01:20:16.562
All you said was,
"Don't take any drugs."

01:20:16.596 --> 01:20:18.998
It was a music festival
for fuck's sake.

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:23.102
Fuck. Shit. Shit! Okay.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.305
Listen. You need to get
to the lab in Italy.

01:20:26.338 --> 01:20:27.841
Do you remember
where we went skiing?

01:20:27.873 --> 01:20:30.342
Yes. Yes, I remember.

01:20:30.377 --> 01:20:31.711
Yeah. Meet me there

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.445
and I'll give you the antidote.

01:20:34.814 --> 01:20:36.115
Okay.

01:20:39.951 --> 01:20:41.787
All right. Jet's ready.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.356
Whiskey, Galahad, get to Italy.

01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:50.229
You two need to fix
this code name thing.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:51.797
And with all due respect, sir...

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:53.132
I don't think Galahad senior

01:20:53.165 --> 01:20:54.700
is ready to return to fieldwork.

01:20:55.802 --> 01:20:58.070
I did actually mean...
Of course.

01:20:58.104 --> 01:21:00.673
And with all disrespect...

01:21:00.707 --> 01:21:02.475
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

01:21:03.743 --> 01:21:06.446
Brains, skills...

01:21:07.646 --> 01:21:08.647
skipping rope?

01:21:11.217 --> 01:21:13.018
- It's a lasso.
- Whatever.

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:14.854
Come on.

01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:18.758
Go on. Vamoose.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:20.060
Yes, sir.

01:21:32.771 --> 01:21:34.140
Drink it.

01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:45.917
Wow.

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.552
It's working already.

01:21:47.587 --> 01:21:49.388
Thank God.

01:21:50.022 --> 01:21:51.222
Agent Whiskey.

01:21:51.257 --> 01:21:53.826
Antidote confirmed
at the target's location.

01:21:53.859 --> 01:21:55.195
Good luck.

01:22:03.636 --> 01:22:05.937
Hold up.
We need you down here, Galahad.

01:22:05.972 --> 01:22:07.373
To secure the control room.

01:22:07.405 --> 01:22:09.141
Probably a good idea, Harry.

01:22:10.075 --> 01:22:11.744
Call you from the top, yeah?

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.321
Buongiorno!

01:22:22.355 --> 01:22:23.656
Buongiorno.

01:22:36.903 --> 01:22:38.104
Hey!

01:22:39.105 --> 01:22:40.385
So sorry about this.

01:22:45.843 --> 01:22:48.147
At the controls. In position.

01:23:07.266 --> 01:23:09.335
Keep this cable car here
till we get back.

01:23:09.369 --> 01:23:10.937
Roger that, Eggsy.

01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:12.905
Clara's definitely here.

01:23:12.939 --> 01:23:14.339
We're getting warmer.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:22.549
Harry Hart, Harry Hart,
super spy, super spy.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:26.052
Looks like we've got a door.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:27.287
Yep.

01:23:28.052 --> 01:23:29.254
There you go.

01:23:39.698 --> 01:23:41.366
I'll cover.

01:23:42.502 --> 01:23:43.503
Hi, there.

01:23:43.836 --> 01:23:44.904
Whew.

01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:46.604
Sorry I'm late.

01:23:46.637 --> 01:23:49.040
You guys did not make
this place easy to find.

01:23:49.074 --> 01:23:51.009
Who are you?

01:23:51.043 --> 01:23:53.679
I'm here to collect
this antidote.

01:23:53.712 --> 01:23:54.714
For Singapore?

01:23:55.647 --> 01:23:56.850
Yeah.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.655
You are Wu Ting Feng?

01:24:07.627 --> 01:24:08.628
Yes.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:12.397
Hey, how are you still alive?

01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:14.633
River, what are you doing here?

01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:15.735
River?

01:24:15.767 --> 01:24:17.002
Hi, Clara.

01:24:17.035 --> 01:24:20.140
What happens at Glasto,
stays in Glasto.

01:24:23.008 --> 01:24:24.776
You motherfucker!
Bye, Charlie.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.913
Sound the alarm!

01:24:26.945 --> 01:24:28.446
You fucking cockroach!

01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:30.483
Jam the door!
Give...

01:24:37.522 --> 01:24:39.124
Fuck!

01:24:39.158 --> 01:24:41.026
Galahad, we're coming.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.762
All clear at the bottom?

01:24:43.695 --> 01:24:46.064
Galahad, come in!

01:24:46.097 --> 01:24:47.899
Open the fucking door.
They've locked.

01:24:47.932 --> 01:24:49.168
Open the door!

01:24:51.035 --> 01:24:52.346
Harry, come on, we're in.
Let's go.

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:53.806
Away, butterflies.

01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:56.308
Butterfly? No, Harry. You've
got to shut the doors, please.

01:24:56.342 --> 01:24:58.310
Come on.
We've gotta go now. Please!

01:24:58.342 --> 01:25:00.278
Shut the fucking door, Harry!

01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:01.914
Harry, are you there?

01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:05.618
Well done, Harry.
Good. Thanks, man.

01:25:05.651 --> 01:25:06.718
Come on. Now!

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.390
It's done.
Thank you.

01:25:34.245 --> 01:25:35.948
You all good down there, Harry?

01:25:35.981 --> 01:25:37.216
All clear.

01:25:42.754 --> 01:25:43.789
Hello, Eggsy.

01:25:45.123 --> 01:25:47.226
Enjoy the ride, bruv.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:57.437
Oh, shit.

01:26:06.479 --> 01:26:08.381
All the buttons are dead.
Controls gone.

01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.650
Everything's in shutdown.
You're on your own, Eggsy.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:57.529
What the fuck is that?

01:27:13.779 --> 01:27:14.881
Oh, my God.

01:27:48.748 --> 01:27:50.817
You've gotta be fucking kidding!

01:28:09.601 --> 01:28:11.470
Jesus fucking Christ!
What the fuck is that?

01:28:11.503 --> 01:28:13.806
What the hell is that?

01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:14.873
Shit!

01:28:40.097 --> 01:28:44.903
That's the first decent shit
I've had in three weeks.

01:28:49.507 --> 01:28:51.910
Harry, meet us at the
emergency rendezvous point.

01:28:51.944 --> 01:28:53.111
Roger that.

01:28:53.846 --> 01:28:55.114
Got you on the GPS.

01:29:23.909 --> 01:29:25.578
So weird to think
this tiny thing

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.312
could save the world.

01:29:27.346 --> 01:29:29.114
Let me have a look.

01:29:32.817 --> 01:29:33.985
Harry.

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:39.892
Am I late?

01:29:40.692 --> 01:29:41.927
You found the antidote.

01:29:44.864 --> 01:29:45.964
Get down!

01:30:03.048 --> 01:30:04.417
You fucking dickhead!

01:30:04.449 --> 01:30:05.916
Fuck you!
I just saved your life!

01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:08.154
Yeah, and cost millions
of people theirs!

01:30:21.734 --> 01:30:24.703
All right, they're going
for cover and reloading.

01:30:24.736 --> 01:30:26.972
I'll fix their wagons.
Cover me, boys!

01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:31.042
Wait.

01:30:31.075 --> 01:30:33.645
Eggsy, I think he could be
working for the other side.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.513
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:30:35.547 --> 01:30:38.083
You're having
a brain fart! Look!

01:30:38.116 --> 01:30:41.654
Does that look like
he's working with them?

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:44.622
Harry, are you seeing
butterflies again?

01:30:44.655 --> 01:30:46.057
I know what I'm seeing.

01:31:37.942 --> 01:31:40.512
Good job
he didn't need our help.

01:31:40.546 --> 01:31:43.281
Thank fucking Christ
I didn't need any backup!

01:31:49.655 --> 01:31:52.090
I'm out of ammo!
Troop carrier coming in.

01:31:52.123 --> 01:31:53.224
What've you got?

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.095
Fuck!

01:32:00.333 --> 01:32:01.968
Shit!
There's a fuck ton of 'em!

01:32:05.303 --> 01:32:06.939
What is this?

01:32:06.972 --> 01:32:09.942
Looks like you packed for
a fucking slumber party, not a mission!

01:32:11.043 --> 01:32:13.912
And they've got
fucking Gatling guns!

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:17.248
You have 10 seconds
to surrender before we open fire!

01:32:17.283 --> 01:32:18.417
Guys, hurry up!

01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:19.483
10!

01:32:19.517 --> 01:32:20.918
Hey!

01:32:20.953 --> 01:32:23.089
9!
Butterfly guy!

01:32:24.489 --> 01:32:25.558
8!

01:32:25.591 --> 01:32:27.493
You don't look like
Ginger fixed you right.

01:32:27.525 --> 01:32:28.626
7!

01:32:28.659 --> 01:32:29.794
I said I'm empty!

01:32:29.829 --> 01:32:31.330
6!
Give me yours.

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:32.831
5!

01:32:32.865 --> 01:32:34.199
Harry, give him the fucking gun!

01:32:34.231 --> 01:32:35.266
4!

01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:39.137
Harry, no!

01:32:43.275 --> 01:32:44.710
Oh, fuck it! Fire!

01:32:44.744 --> 01:32:45.978
Harry, get down!

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:54.886
I mean, honestly, Harry,

01:32:54.919 --> 01:32:56.355
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:32:56.387 --> 01:32:58.756
He broke the vial on purpose!

01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:01.192
You're a fucking idiot!
You're out of control, Harry!

01:33:01.226 --> 01:33:03.306
If we made it out of here,
he was gonna kill us both!

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:10.703
For fuck's sake, it looks like he wouldn't
have fucking had to!

01:33:10.735 --> 01:33:12.171
Oh, ye of little faith.

01:33:33.859 --> 01:33:36.227
This does not mean
you're off the fucking hook!

01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:38.664
We need to go dark.

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:39.940
We don't know
who else at Statesman

01:33:39.964 --> 01:33:42.433
could be working against us.

01:33:42.467 --> 01:33:43.567
Shit! This is all my fault.

01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:44.679
You weren't ready for the field

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:45.770
and I pushed for it!

01:33:45.803 --> 01:33:46.872
He showed his hand.

01:33:46.905 --> 01:33:48.707
You think he'd have let us live?

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.741
You should be thanking me
for saving our arses!

01:33:50.775 --> 01:33:51.844
Saving our arses?

01:33:51.877 --> 01:33:53.412
Try saying that
to fucking Whiskey!

01:34:03.622 --> 01:34:06.025
You are unbelievable!

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:07.926
- Merlin, can you hear me?
- Yes, Eggsy.

01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:09.261
Whiskey's down.
He's been shot.

01:34:09.761 --> 01:34:11.163
What happened?

01:34:18.035 --> 01:34:20.905
He got caught in the crossfire.

01:34:20.939 --> 01:34:22.975
I've applied the alpha gel.
We'll bring him in.

01:34:23.007 --> 01:34:24.853
But first, I've gotta find a
way to get back up to that lab

01:34:24.877 --> 01:34:26.678
and retrieve more antidote.

01:34:29.381 --> 01:34:32.484
Charlie, what's
happening? Where are you?

01:34:32.516 --> 01:34:34.118
Everything's under control.

01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:36.855
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I'm so sorry.

01:34:36.887 --> 01:34:39.156
Please don't tell Poppy
it was me they followed.

01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:40.658
Don't worry, darling.

01:34:40.692 --> 01:34:42.694
What happens in Italy...

01:34:45.196 --> 01:34:46.431
stays in Italy.

01:34:47.598 --> 01:34:48.833
Thank you.

01:35:01.981 --> 01:35:06.552
Merlin, change of plans.
Wu Ting Feng, Singapore.

01:35:06.584 --> 01:35:07.819
- Who?
- Exactly.

01:35:07.852 --> 01:35:09.520
It's the only lead we've got.

01:35:09.555 --> 01:35:11.222
So I suggest
you find out who he is.

01:35:13.123 --> 01:35:14.159
Come on.

01:35:18.163 --> 01:35:20.932
Wu Ting Feng, he's
an assistant at a law firm.

01:35:20.964 --> 01:35:22.601
Let's get through
their firewall.

01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:23.868
Yep.

01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.004
Merlin...

01:35:26.037 --> 01:35:28.507
have you ever wanted
to do more than this?

01:35:29.507 --> 01:35:31.109
Are you serious?
Yeah.

01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:32.076
This is vital.

01:35:32.110 --> 01:35:33.778
Without us, they'd be lost.

01:35:33.811 --> 01:35:36.113
I know, but you know
what I mean.

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:38.549
Get out there in the field.

01:35:38.583 --> 01:35:39.750
Well, have you ever asked?

01:35:39.784 --> 01:35:41.020
Of course I have.

01:35:41.052 --> 01:35:43.488
But every time an agent's
position has come up...

01:35:43.521 --> 01:35:46.324
Whiskey has voted against me.

01:35:46.357 --> 01:35:48.258
No.
Yeah.

01:35:48.293 --> 01:35:50.562
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, check it out.

01:35:50.596 --> 01:35:51.664
Email in from Poppy,

01:35:51.696 --> 01:35:53.565
from a senior partner
at the firm.

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:56.534
They're coordinates.

01:36:00.138 --> 01:36:01.373
Cambodia?

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.909
You have any reconnaissance
drones down in Asia?

01:36:04.942 --> 01:36:06.622
Sure do.
Sending them in right now.

01:36:13.383 --> 01:36:14.962
The government today urged

01:36:14.986 --> 01:36:16.154
Golden Circle victims...

01:36:16.186 --> 01:36:18.122
to report to
the temporary field hospitals

01:36:18.155 --> 01:36:21.025
now set up across the country.

01:36:21.058 --> 01:36:22.869
The president's
handling of the crisis

01:36:22.893 --> 01:36:25.664
has been commended
by other world leaders.

01:36:25.698 --> 01:36:28.433
Damn. Politics has
never been so easy.

01:36:28.467 --> 01:36:30.602
Oh, Jesus, Fox.

01:36:30.634 --> 01:36:31.936
What?

01:36:39.878 --> 01:36:41.247
Oh, God.

01:36:45.984 --> 01:36:47.151
Like I said, sir...

01:36:47.185 --> 01:36:49.888
this affects all people
from all backgrounds.

01:36:49.921 --> 01:36:51.722
I'm disappointed, Fox.

01:36:51.756 --> 01:36:53.624
Disappointed and disgusted.

01:36:53.658 --> 01:36:56.662
Mr. President,
I routinely work

01:36:56.695 --> 01:36:59.130
a 20 hour day for you,
7 days a week.

01:36:59.164 --> 01:37:02.301
Maybe some can do that
without chemical help.

01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:05.470
Countless people
are going to die.

01:37:05.503 --> 01:37:07.138
You can save them, sir.

01:37:08.039 --> 01:37:09.642
Innocent people like me.

01:37:12.009 --> 01:37:13.913
Not that innocent.

01:37:44.409 --> 01:37:45.544
He looks great.

01:37:45.576 --> 01:37:46.611
Good.

01:37:51.949 --> 01:37:53.317
Good news, gentlemen.

01:37:53.351 --> 01:37:54.953
He'll be back on
his feet in no time.

01:37:54.986 --> 01:37:56.954
I'm not certain
that's a good idea.

01:37:56.988 --> 01:37:58.089
What do you mean?

01:37:58.123 --> 01:38:00.159
I shot Agent Whiskey.
Deliberately.

01:38:00.592 --> 01:38:01.692
What, why?

01:38:01.726 --> 01:38:02.927
He was working against us.

01:38:02.962 --> 01:38:05.062
And until we find out why,
I say we trust no one.

01:38:05.096 --> 01:38:07.231
Merlin, Harry's sick.

01:38:07.265 --> 01:38:09.133
This whole thing is my fault.

01:38:09.167 --> 01:38:10.668
I thought he was ready.

01:38:15.973 --> 01:38:18.543
I'm sorry,
I've got to take this.

01:38:18.576 --> 01:38:19.977
Listen to me.

01:38:20.011 --> 01:38:21.613
This is not about
my mental health.

01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:24.249
If there's a chance there's
a double agent in our midst...

01:38:24.281 --> 01:38:28.953
or worse, if Statesman itself
has a dark agenda...

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:30.654
we have to safeguard
this mission.

01:38:30.687 --> 01:38:34.625
We both know the president
wants these victims dead.

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:36.027
Hey, baby.

01:38:37.995 --> 01:38:39.230
Hey.

01:38:41.565 --> 01:38:42.499
Fuck.

01:38:42.533 --> 01:38:45.336
Look, Harry, I trust you.
I always have.

01:38:45.369 --> 01:38:49.973
But it's about this situation.
We need Statesman's resources.

01:38:50.007 --> 01:38:52.075
And I need to know
that you are fit for work.

01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:53.845
Babe, why didn't you call me?

01:38:53.878 --> 01:38:55.379
Are you the banana man?

01:38:55.413 --> 01:38:56.915
Listen, we're on
the verge of finding

01:38:56.948 --> 01:38:58.549
an antidote.
It's gonna be all right.

01:38:58.583 --> 01:38:59.451
Now, look left for me.

01:38:59.484 --> 01:39:00.761
There's nothing wrong
with my brain.

01:39:00.785 --> 01:39:02.252
Look right.

01:39:02.287 --> 01:39:03.555
Can you remember the headline

01:39:03.588 --> 01:39:05.332
when you uncovered
that spy ring in the Pentagon?

01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:07.491
The football.
England beat Germany, 5-1.

01:39:07.525 --> 01:39:09.026
Thatcher's
assassination attempt.

01:39:09.061 --> 01:39:10.128
Charles and Di's wedding.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.730
Hey, Bjorn Borg.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.976
Babe, if you can hear me,

01:39:24.008 --> 01:39:26.278
I want you to know
that I love you.

01:39:26.311 --> 01:39:28.355
And if we get through this,
and you'll have me back...

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:31.216
I wanna be with you.
No matter what.

01:39:31.249 --> 01:39:32.326
I promise I won't let you down.

01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:33.951
It's all gonna be all right.

01:39:33.985 --> 01:39:35.386
My favorite singer.

01:39:35.419 --> 01:39:37.655
I don't bloody know.
How would I know that?

01:39:37.689 --> 01:39:39.991
It's John Denver.
Merlin!

01:39:40.025 --> 01:39:42.027
Have you got eyes
on that location yet?

01:39:42.061 --> 01:39:44.129
Soon. The reconnaissance
drone's about an hour away.

01:39:44.162 --> 01:39:45.305
Which gives us time
to sort out...

01:39:45.329 --> 01:39:47.031
Bollocks, we haven't
time for anything.

01:39:47.065 --> 01:39:49.368
I'm leaving now.
With or without you.

01:40:07.351 --> 01:40:09.287
Hello!

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.689
Identify yourself.

01:40:10.722 --> 01:40:15.259
My name is Stacey Prewitt.
I'm Ms. Poppy Adams' attorney.

01:40:15.293 --> 01:40:17.362
Poppy, you expecting
a lawyer tonight?

01:40:17.395 --> 01:40:19.431
Oh, yes. Please send him in.

01:40:19.463 --> 01:40:22.567
But don't forget to
reactivate the landmines.

01:40:27.905 --> 01:40:29.439
Good evening, Ms. Adams.

01:40:29.473 --> 01:40:34.745
My lawyer is bringing you
the document right now.

01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:36.248
Hurry up.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.381
And once you countersign,

01:40:37.415 --> 01:40:38.749
it becomes
an executive decree...

01:40:38.784 --> 01:40:39.884
and you can't back out,

01:40:39.918 --> 01:40:41.219
and then I release the antidote.

01:40:41.252 --> 01:40:42.587
Can you give me any assurance

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.388
you can get it
out there in time?

01:40:44.422 --> 01:40:45.500
And where's it gonna come from?

01:40:45.524 --> 01:40:46.857
How long it'll take
to distribute?

01:40:46.891 --> 01:40:49.494
I wouldn't worry about that.
I have secure stockpiles...

01:40:49.528 --> 01:40:52.564
hidden in every
major city worldwide.

01:40:52.597 --> 01:40:55.000
And when I enter
the access code...

01:40:55.033 --> 01:40:56.433
my fleet of drones

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:59.337
will distribute
the antidote immediately.

01:40:59.369 --> 01:41:01.872
So don't dilly-dally
signin' that document

01:41:01.906 --> 01:41:03.674
'cause time is running out.

01:41:06.512 --> 01:41:07.846
You dumb bitch!

01:41:17.823 --> 01:41:18.856
You all right?

01:41:20.926 --> 01:41:22.961
What was that
phone call you got?

01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:25.263
Let's not, Harry.

01:41:25.296 --> 01:41:26.597
I don't think
you'd sympathize...

01:41:26.631 --> 01:41:28.799
and I'm not really in
the mood for a lecture.

01:41:32.803 --> 01:41:33.838
All right.

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:39.645
How about a martini?
For old times' sake?

01:41:41.745 --> 01:41:42.780
Yeah, all right.

01:41:55.927 --> 01:41:57.896
I had a girlfriend.

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:01.632
I lost her.

01:42:02.633 --> 01:42:04.203
And it broke me.

01:42:06.171 --> 01:42:08.606
And now,
if this mission fails...

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.375
she's gonna die.

01:42:13.378 --> 01:42:15.681
I know it's against
Kingsman rules,

01:42:15.713 --> 01:42:17.748
having a relationship.

01:42:21.753 --> 01:42:23.554
When I was shot...

01:42:23.588 --> 01:42:25.156
can you guess
what the last thing was

01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:26.658
that flashed through my mind?

01:42:29.127 --> 01:42:32.830
It was absolutely nothing.

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.802
I had no ties.

01:42:37.502 --> 01:42:40.471
No bittersweet memories.

01:42:40.503 --> 01:42:42.573
I was leaving nothing behind.

01:42:44.542 --> 01:42:46.812
Never experienced
companionship...

01:42:47.811 --> 01:42:49.347
never been in love...

01:42:50.448 --> 01:42:52.383
and in that moment...

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:56.120
all I felt was loneliness...

01:42:56.154 --> 01:42:57.388
and regret.

01:42:59.024 --> 01:43:00.557
I'm sorry.

01:43:00.592 --> 01:43:01.627
Don't be.

01:43:03.828 --> 01:43:06.365
Just know that
having something to lose...

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:10.868
is what makes life worth living.

01:43:11.735 --> 01:43:13.838
Now, let's go
and save your girl.

01:43:15.173 --> 01:43:16.875
I missed you, Harry.

01:43:22.079 --> 01:43:23.480
Gentlemen.

01:43:23.513 --> 01:43:25.417
I hate to break up a party.

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:28.586
We're nearly there,
so I suggest we get ready.

01:43:29.887 --> 01:43:30.921
Follow me.

01:43:40.698 --> 01:43:42.801
Oh, yes.

01:43:52.276 --> 01:43:53.877
Hello, gorgeous.

01:43:53.912 --> 01:43:55.046
I'm Jack. What's your name?

01:43:55.079 --> 01:43:57.381
How would you like to ride
home on a real cowboy?

01:43:57.415 --> 01:43:58.984
I got a six pack
of cold ones on ice

01:43:59.016 --> 01:44:00.184
and my roomie's out all night.

01:44:00.217 --> 01:44:03.453
So you can scream my name
as loud as you need to, sugar.

01:44:03.488 --> 01:44:06.258
I hate to do this to you, Jack.

01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:07.391
Who's this pretty lady?

01:44:07.424 --> 01:44:08.826
She's dead.

01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:11.462
Cops said wrong place,
wrong time.

01:44:11.494 --> 01:44:13.631
Hey, honey. I'm heading
to the grocery store.

01:44:18.602 --> 01:44:19.971
My name is Poppy Adams.

01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:37.955
Ginger.

01:44:37.989 --> 01:44:41.426
Goddamn butterfly guy shot me
in the fucking head.

01:44:41.458 --> 01:44:42.927
Why would he do that?

01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:47.932
Well, I'm guessing
you didn't fix him right.

01:44:47.966 --> 01:44:49.567
And where the hell is he?

01:44:49.601 --> 01:44:53.304
He's on his way to Cambodia
with Eggsy and Merlin.

01:44:53.337 --> 01:44:55.373
That's where Poppy's base is.

01:44:55.406 --> 01:44:57.107
Eggsy's gonna need backup.

01:44:57.141 --> 01:44:58.375
Yes, he is.

01:44:58.409 --> 01:44:59.845
Get the Silver Pony
on the runway

01:44:59.878 --> 01:45:01.079
and ready to take off.

01:45:11.823 --> 01:45:13.124
Hey, hey.

01:45:13.156 --> 01:45:15.726
Looking good, Merlin.

01:45:16.393 --> 01:45:18.262
Feeling good, Eggsy.

01:45:21.298 --> 01:45:23.567
Right. This is yours.

01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:26.104
That's for you.

01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:40.619
Press the "S".

01:45:41.384 --> 01:45:42.954
Minesweeper.

01:45:42.986 --> 01:45:44.954
Courtesy of Statesman.

01:45:44.989 --> 01:45:47.225
- And what about these?
- Careful.

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:48.726
Those are hand grenades.

01:45:50.994 --> 01:45:52.963
As discussed...

01:45:52.997 --> 01:45:54.165
this is for the endgame.

01:45:55.065 --> 01:45:56.600
I'm entrusting it to you.

01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:05.744
And I'm entrusting this...

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.748
to me.

01:46:32.137 --> 01:46:35.973
Millions of
Golden Circle victims worldwide...

01:46:36.007 --> 01:46:38.810
are now entering
stage three paralysis.

01:46:41.445 --> 01:46:42.555
In his latest statement...

01:46:42.579 --> 01:46:44.149
the president promised
he was doing

01:46:44.181 --> 01:46:45.548
everything in his power...

01:46:45.583 --> 01:46:48.720
to speed up negotiations
and save lives.

01:46:48.753 --> 01:46:50.421
But fears are growing
that for many,

01:46:50.454 --> 01:46:52.223
it may soon be too late.

01:46:52.257 --> 01:46:55.426
Our thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

01:46:55.458 --> 01:46:56.727
God help us all.

01:47:39.904 --> 01:47:41.948
Right.
This is where we split up.

01:47:41.972 --> 01:47:43.373
Pincer movement.

01:47:43.406 --> 01:47:44.741
Merlin, you're with me.

01:47:44.775 --> 01:47:46.978
Eggsy, you signal
when we're in position.

01:47:55.186 --> 01:47:57.255
Don't move.

01:47:58.289 --> 01:48:00.992
You move, we die.

01:48:09.433 --> 01:48:11.602
Luckily, I have this.

01:48:19.944 --> 01:48:23.714
This spray will freeze
the trigger mechanism...

01:48:23.748 --> 01:48:26.817
give us a split second.

01:48:27.619 --> 01:48:30.121
So on the count of three...

01:48:30.154 --> 01:48:31.422
what I want you to...

01:48:31.454 --> 01:48:32.690
Merlin!

01:48:48.472 --> 01:48:50.541
Merlin, what the fuck
have you done?

01:48:50.574 --> 01:48:54.144
Our journey together
began many years ago...

01:48:54.178 --> 01:48:56.815
when your father
did the same thing for us.

01:48:56.847 --> 01:48:59.549
Our journey began
with a mistake I made.

01:48:59.583 --> 01:49:01.653
Give me the can.
That's an order.

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:03.188
Can's empty.

01:49:03.855 --> 01:49:05.623
Split second's over.

01:49:05.656 --> 01:49:07.292
You two need to get going.

01:49:07.324 --> 01:49:09.026
No, no, no.
There's got to be another way.

01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:10.061
He's right.

01:49:10.095 --> 01:49:11.596
Mission comes first.

01:49:11.628 --> 01:49:12.963
Bollocks, mission comes first!

01:49:12.997 --> 01:49:14.065
Eggsy!

01:49:14.097 --> 01:49:16.734
This is no time for emotion.
Remember your training.

01:49:16.767 --> 01:49:18.203
Or we all die.

01:49:20.504 --> 01:49:22.306
Now get on with it.

01:49:22.338 --> 01:49:24.842
Do as you're told.
Move it!

01:49:32.283 --> 01:49:33.284
Go.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.361
It's been an honor.

01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:46.830

Elton, just calm down.
Fuck you!

01:53:32.123 --> 01:53:33.424

01:53:33.457 --> 01:53:34.557

Get this out of here. Go!

01:55:16.125 --> 01:55:17.328
Eggsy, get the case.

01:55:22.165 --> 01:55:23.834

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.369
Motherfucker!

01:57:37.834 --> 01:57:40.102
Get out of the way, Elton.

01:57:40.137 --> 01:57:42.406
Stay down.
It's not allowed to hurt me.

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.441
Thank you.

01:58:21.744 --> 01:58:22.913

01:58:23.646 --> 01:58:24.948

01:58:25.615 --> 01:58:27.618
Fuck you, Elton.

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:31.689

01:58:34.824 --> 01:58:35.892
Fuck!

01:58:38.095 --> 01:58:39.797
Elton, take the ball.

01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:50.407
Thank you.

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.842
Now, go off and save the world.

01:58:52.875 --> 01:58:54.678
If I save the world,
can I have two tickets

01:58:54.712 --> 01:58:55.879
to your next concert?

01:58:55.913 --> 01:58:57.881
Darling, if you save the world,

01:58:57.914 --> 01:58:59.717
you can have a backstage pass.

01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:09.726
Fuck you.

01:59:12.729 --> 01:59:14.030
Time's up.

01:59:14.064 --> 01:59:15.333
Fuck!

01:59:20.936 --> 01:59:22.136
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie!

01:59:22.539 --> 01:59:23.573
Get them!

01:59:23.606 --> 01:59:24.673
Got it.

01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:27.178
Kill him, Bennie!

01:59:27.211 --> 01:59:29.512
Here, heel! Heel! Good boy!

01:59:29.546 --> 01:59:30.580
Come on!

01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.254
Give me the code.

01:59:38.288 --> 01:59:40.024
No. We're not done yet.

01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:47.364
Lucky for you, Charlie...

01:59:47.396 --> 01:59:48.464
one of us understands

01:59:48.498 --> 01:59:49.999
what it means to be a gentleman.

01:59:55.539 --> 01:59:57.008
Let's make this fair.

02:00:43.753 --> 02:00:45.021
Give me the code!

02:00:45.055 --> 02:00:46.990
I can't.

02:00:47.024 --> 02:00:48.792
Only Poppy knows it.

02:00:48.824 --> 02:00:50.627
Well, then you're no use
to me, are you?

02:00:51.294 --> 02:00:52.428
For the record, Charlie...

02:00:52.462 --> 02:00:55.799
I'm more of a gentleman
than you'll ever be.

02:00:55.833 --> 02:00:58.402
But right now, it's time
to drop the gentle bit.

02:00:59.570 --> 02:01:01.038
This is for Kingsman.

02:01:02.039 --> 02:01:03.641
For my mate Brandon.

02:01:04.374 --> 02:01:06.208
For Roxy.

02:01:06.241 --> 02:01:07.778
For JB.

02:01:10.079 --> 02:01:11.649
And for Merlin.

02:01:13.216 --> 02:01:14.918
Good night, bruv.

02:01:41.343 --> 02:01:43.513
Hey, fellas.

02:01:43.547 --> 02:01:45.115
You're going to
give us the code.

02:01:45.147 --> 02:01:47.049
Mmm.

02:01:47.083 --> 02:01:48.352
Or what?

02:01:48.386 --> 02:01:50.588
'Cause you don't seem like
the kind of gentleman

02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:53.123
who would hurt a lady.

02:01:55.958 --> 02:01:58.761
Perhaps not.
Call me old-fashioned...

02:01:58.794 --> 02:02:01.196
I don't consider genocide
especially ladylike.

02:02:01.231 --> 02:02:03.968
Right. Enough small talk.

02:02:06.235 --> 02:02:07.336
Give us the code.

02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:08.638
Sure.

02:02:08.672 --> 02:02:10.975
No. I don't think so.

02:02:11.741 --> 02:02:12.776
Ooh!

02:02:15.178 --> 02:02:16.446
Ow!

02:02:21.016 --> 02:02:22.618
Heroin.

02:02:22.651 --> 02:02:24.020
You know, where I come from...

02:02:24.053 --> 02:02:26.213
this shit you've been peddling's
ruined a lot of lives.

02:02:27.289 --> 02:02:29.426
But yours is even more deadly.

02:02:29.458 --> 02:02:31.528
But it feels so nice,
it's gonna make you

02:02:31.561 --> 02:02:33.363
lower your guard.
Mmm.

02:02:33.396 --> 02:02:36.900
Our colleague, Merlin,
may he rest in peace...

02:02:36.932 --> 02:02:39.435
managed to synthesize your
horrible little formula...

02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:40.771
and speed up its effects.

02:02:40.805 --> 02:02:43.807
So I would say you have
just under eight minutes...

02:02:43.841 --> 02:02:46.643
before paralysis sets in
and your breathing stops.

02:02:46.677 --> 02:02:49.379
But, of course,
you know all about that.

02:02:49.413 --> 02:02:52.415
So here's the deal.
You release the antidote worldwide,

02:02:52.449 --> 02:02:54.250
and we make sure you get a dose.

02:02:54.284 --> 02:02:56.385
I have to give you
the code to live?

02:02:56.419 --> 02:02:59.656
Honey, you're so smart.
You should work for me.

02:02:59.690 --> 02:03:02.259
Right. Give us the code.

02:03:02.293 --> 02:03:06.263
Why not? The decree's getting
signed soon...

02:03:06.297 --> 02:03:07.964
anyhoo. Um...

02:03:08.597 --> 02:03:10.967
It's "Viva las vegan."

02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:13.169
Get it?

02:03:13.838 --> 02:03:16.306
"Viva las..."

02:03:16.339 --> 02:03:17.708
Mmm.

02:03:18.708 --> 02:03:20.778
Come snuggle with me.

02:03:21.578 --> 02:03:23.647
I like you.

02:03:25.649 --> 02:03:27.852
I don't think
that's terribly likely.

02:03:50.173 --> 02:03:51.308
She's OD'd.

02:03:51.341 --> 02:03:52.810
You gave her too much.

02:03:52.842 --> 02:03:54.377
Did I?

02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:57.023
You know, I really don't have as much
experience with all this drug stuff...

02:03:57.047 --> 02:03:58.048
as people think.

02:03:58.714 --> 02:04:00.049
Better be the right code.

02:04:03.887 --> 02:04:07.356
"Viva las..."

02:04:07.391 --> 02:04:08.692
So?

02:04:12.262 --> 02:04:13.597
Don't move, kid.

02:04:13.629 --> 02:04:14.832
You try anything funny,

02:04:14.865 --> 02:04:16.185
and I'll turn
this thing electric.

02:04:17.667 --> 02:04:20.303
Now give up your guns,
fellas. Slide 'em over.

02:04:26.008 --> 02:04:26.909
Whiskey.

02:04:26.944 --> 02:04:28.812
We are all
on the same side here.

02:04:28.846 --> 02:04:29.946
You've had a head injury.

02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.748
The exact same thing
happened to Harry.

02:04:31.781 --> 02:04:34.250
You're havin'
some sort of brain glitch.

02:04:34.284 --> 02:04:37.154
Nope. My brain's
all good, kid.

02:04:37.686 --> 02:04:39.122
And you know what?

02:04:39.155 --> 02:04:42.926
I reckon the same was true for your friend
Harry over here.

02:04:42.958 --> 02:04:45.961
Real fine instincts,
I'll give him that.

02:04:45.995 --> 02:04:47.396
So stay still...

02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:48.541
or I'll dice him up so small,

02:04:48.565 --> 02:04:49.675
you can take him
home in a bucket...

02:04:49.699 --> 02:04:51.067
and still have room
for what's left

02:04:51.101 --> 02:04:52.636
of your buddy, Merlin.

02:04:53.671 --> 02:04:55.338
Well, that's just fucking great.

02:04:55.372 --> 02:04:56.940
You're working
for the president?

02:04:56.973 --> 02:04:58.208
That asshole?

02:04:59.342 --> 02:05:03.480
Hell no. It's a matter
of personal principle, agent.

02:05:03.512 --> 02:05:06.015
No more drug users.

02:05:06.048 --> 02:05:09.118
And the Statesman
share price rockets.

02:05:10.587 --> 02:05:13.890
So those are your principles?
Making money?

02:05:13.923 --> 02:05:16.226
Our agencies were
founded to uphold peace.

02:05:16.258 --> 02:05:17.461
To protect the innocent.

02:05:17.494 --> 02:05:19.562
Do you wanna know
who was innocent?

02:05:19.596 --> 02:05:22.600
My high school sweetheart.

02:05:23.066 --> 02:05:24.901
Love of my life.

02:05:24.935 --> 02:05:26.837
Pregnant with my little boy.

02:05:27.736 --> 02:05:29.707
He'd be about your age now...

02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:31.708
if his mama hadn't got caught
in the crossfire...

02:05:31.741 --> 02:05:32.842
when two meth head freaks

02:05:32.875 --> 02:05:35.913
decided to rob
a fucking convenience store.

02:05:38.449 --> 02:05:41.618
A world without
those people in it...

02:05:41.650 --> 02:05:44.120
sure smells like peace to me.

02:05:44.887 --> 02:05:47.056
You break the law...

02:05:47.091 --> 02:05:48.959
you pay the price.

02:05:49.625 --> 02:05:51.660
Good riddance...

02:05:51.694 --> 02:05:53.964
to all of them.

02:05:58.701 --> 02:06:01.971
That's why I got
to destroy that case.

02:06:02.004 --> 02:06:05.708
Now slide it over,
Agent Galahad.

02:06:10.579 --> 02:06:12.181
Thank you.

02:06:12.214 --> 02:06:14.183
Do you know what, Harry?

02:06:14.217 --> 02:06:15.284
I think he's got a point.

02:06:17.921 --> 02:06:21.225
I think it sounds
like a bright idea.

02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:42.031
Put alpha gel on that, dickhead.

02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:53.543
"Viva las vegan."

02:08:55.744 --> 02:08:57.064
This one's for you, Merlin.

02:09:11.662 --> 02:09:12.772
It's a day
of worldwide celebration

02:09:12.796 --> 02:09:15.198
as millions rejoice...

02:09:15.231 --> 02:09:18.602
after they or their loved ones
were saved from death.

02:09:30.513 --> 02:09:33.192
Distribution of The
Golden Circle antidote continues...

02:09:33.216 --> 02:09:35.118
and field hospitals
are emptying...

02:09:35.151 --> 02:09:38.488
as victims return
to their homes tonight, cured.

02:09:59.741 --> 02:10:01.977
Come on, Liam. Man, come on.

02:10:02.012 --> 02:10:04.481
Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:10:10.086 --> 02:10:11.722
I love you, man!
I love you!

02:10:11.754 --> 02:10:13.990
I'm never touching
that shit again!

02:10:17.293 --> 02:10:18.294
What happened?

02:10:19.829 --> 02:10:22.065
Did I miss something?
You sure did.

02:10:22.097 --> 02:10:26.202
From now on, Tequila,
I suggest you stick to booze.

02:10:28.838 --> 02:10:30.407
The president
actively sanctioned

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.677
the deaths of hundreds
of millions of people...

02:10:34.543 --> 02:10:37.046
and lied to the public.

02:10:37.079 --> 02:10:40.249
I am proud to be responsible
for his impeachment...

02:10:40.283 --> 02:10:42.084
and I will do everything I can

02:10:42.118 --> 02:10:44.588
to ensure a smooth
transition of power.

02:10:45.588 --> 02:10:48.458
In honor
of this historic occasion,

02:10:48.491 --> 02:10:49.927
we have purchased...

02:10:50.961 --> 02:10:53.297
a distillery in Scotland.

02:10:54.431 --> 02:10:55.598
This shows the world...

02:10:55.632 --> 02:11:00.504
that Kingsman is now
joining the liquor business.

02:11:01.137 --> 02:11:03.473
Before we were cousins.

02:11:03.506 --> 02:11:07.910
Now we're brothers,
working side-by-side.

02:11:07.944 --> 02:11:11.080
All our resources are now yours.

02:11:11.114 --> 02:11:13.350
You can rebuild.

02:11:13.382 --> 02:11:15.317
Yeah, y'all shittin'
in high cotton now.

02:11:16.518 --> 02:11:18.888
Agent Tequila,
this is a formal occasion...

02:11:18.922 --> 02:11:20.723
where's your tie and jacket?

02:11:20.757 --> 02:11:21.891
Sorry, sir.

02:11:21.924 --> 02:11:25.662
Maybe the Kingsman boys
can dress you properly.

02:11:26.762 --> 02:11:28.332
To our union!

02:11:29.399 --> 02:11:30.400
To our union!

02:11:34.236 --> 02:11:36.239
Final order of business...

02:11:37.039 --> 02:11:38.473
we would be honored

02:11:38.507 --> 02:11:42.044
if one of you would be
our new Agent Whiskey.

02:11:42.079 --> 02:11:46.950
Yeah, this two Galahad thing
is just fucking confusing.

02:11:48.150 --> 02:11:49.586
Well, I'm very honored...

02:11:51.887 --> 02:11:53.089
Champ...

02:11:54.891 --> 02:11:57.094
I'd like to throw
my hat in the ring.

02:12:01.364 --> 02:12:02.432
All right!

02:12:03.667 --> 02:12:05.002
Statesmen, the vote.

02:12:08.003 --> 02:12:09.972
Looks like she's in.

02:12:10.006 --> 02:12:11.307
Have a seat.

02:12:15.845 --> 02:12:17.613
To Agent Whiskey!

02:12:17.646 --> 02:12:18.781
Agent Whiskey!

02:12:26.388 --> 02:12:27.457
Cheers!

02:12:32.294 --> 02:12:34.698
Are you sure
I don't look like a dick?

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:38.668
Look in the mirror.

02:12:44.707 --> 02:12:46.075
What do you see?

02:12:46.109 --> 02:12:49.611
Someone who can't believe
what the fuck is going on.

02:12:50.914 --> 02:12:52.649
I see a man who is honorable...

02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:56.119
brave...

02:12:56.819 --> 02:12:58.488
loyal...

02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:00.791
who's fulfilled
his huge potential.

02:13:02.458 --> 02:13:04.828
A man who's done
something good with his life.

02:13:06.128 --> 02:13:08.364
I owe you everything, Harry.

02:13:09.632 --> 02:13:11.034
Thank you.

02:13:11.066 --> 02:13:12.368
Don't mention it.

02:13:13.636 --> 02:13:14.638
You ready?

02:13:17.606 --> 02:13:19.542
Not a doubt in my mind.

02:14:11.227 --> 02:14:14.129
As one of our
founding Kingsman once said...

02:14:14.163 --> 02:14:16.132
this is not the end.

02:14:16.165 --> 02:14:19.302
It is not even the beginning
of the end.

02:14:19.334 --> 02:14:23.806
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

02:14:24.574 --> 02:14:25.842
Yeah!
