useful to her.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.188

11:38.271 --> 11:40.021
two weeks ago,
from her sister,

11:40.104 --> 11:41.355
saying that Miss Walker
was worried

11:41.438 --> 11:43.188
it was too cold for her
in Inverness,

11:43.271 --> 11:44.938

no medical advice

11:55.521 --> 11:58.647
Captain Sutherland thought
she was "much improved,"

11:58.730 --> 12:00.605

12:00.688 --> 12:02.897

12:04.021 --> 12:05.229

12:05.313 --> 12:07.688

12:07.772 --> 12:09.730

for some of the kin,

12:09.813 --> 12:11.730

12:11.813 --> 12:15.188
Captain Sutherland's mother

12:15.271 --> 12:16.897

Miss Walker briefly,

she has rather more backbone

12:20.146 --> 12:23.355
