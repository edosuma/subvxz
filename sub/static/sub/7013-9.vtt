00:08.608 --> 00:11.236
Steven, I'm telling you,
beards are out.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.245
Look at Malibu Barbie.

00:13.313 --> 00:15.543
She can date
anyone she wants.

00:15.615 --> 00:18.641
But she's
with Malibu Ken. Why?

00:18.718 --> 00:22.586
Because Malibu Ken
doesn't have a beard!

00:22.655 --> 00:26.113
Yes, he does.
Malibu Barbie's his beard.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.586
No straight man would wear
shorts that tight.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.757
I don't care.
Just shave it off.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.859
It's like making out
with carpet.

00:36.936 --> 00:40.337
Well, here it is- the beginning
of the end for you two.

00:40.407 --> 00:45.344
Yeah, I remember the part of our relationship
when allJackie did was boss me around.

00:45.412 --> 00:50.349
Yeah, that part only lasted-
what, like, six years?

00:50.417 --> 00:52.681
And he's a better man
for it.

00:52.752 --> 00:56.779
So come on, Steven.
Let's shave that beard.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.884
Jackie, you just gave an order
in the form of a cheer.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.197
Oh, where are you going?

01:05.265 --> 01:07.460
Wherever the beard takes me.

01:09.102 --> 01:12.196
Jackie, sweetie, we just got a phone call,
and you're needed at home.

01:12.272 --> 01:15.105
So why don't you grab your coat.
Mr. Forman'll give you a ride home.

01:15.175 --> 01:18.235
- Do you know what's going on?
- No. I don't know anything.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.805
I know everything!

01:24.117 --> 01:26.950
You know how Jackie's father
is a city councilman?

01:27.020 --> 01:30.547
Not anymore. He just got arrested
for bribery. He could go to prison.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.989
Well, I'm glad.

01:33.059 --> 01:37.996
That guy makes Republicans look like
a bunch of crooks and greedy businessmen.

01:38.064 --> 01:42.330
Yeah, well, thank God for the honest ones
like Richard Nixon, huh?

01:42.402 --> 01:44.563
Oh, no.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.233
What did you say?

01:49.876 --> 01:52.367
I- I said that...

01:52.445 --> 01:55.812
Nixon was framed,
and Kennedy was a commie?

01:55.882 --> 01:58.214
That's right.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.527
What's with the gun,
Trigger?

02:09.596 --> 02:13.930
Oh, will you relax, Eric?
It's not a gun. It's a BB gun.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.835
Yeah, I lost it when I was, like, 1 0, and I found
it this morning buried in my backyard.

02:18.905 --> 02:22.102
Why were you digging
in your backyard?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.939
Uh, dinosaurs.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.874
Watch the news, Donna!

02:31.351 --> 02:34.809
You guys, I can't believe that Mr. Burkhart
might actually be going to prison.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.085
Ah, the tragedy. My father
was sent to prison...

02:38.158 --> 02:40.649
and it led to a life
of drugs and prostitution.

02:42.095 --> 02:45.462
- What?
- Yes. Then his pimp killed him.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.968
But then the medical
examiner found a tiny hair.

02:49.035 --> 02:53.768
And he solved the crime, and he sent
the pimp bastard to the chair.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.707
Fez, that was last night's
episode of <i>Quincy.</i>

02:58.044 --> 03:01.844
Oh, I didn't know
you watched that show.

03:01.915 --> 03:05.476
Yeah, this is rough stuff
Jackie's going through.

03:05.552 --> 03:09.181
She'll come runnin' to me-
Old Faithful.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.849
Kelso,Jackie's
with me now.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.359
Maybe.
But we have history.

03:14.427 --> 03:18.386
So when she needs a shoulder to cry on,
she'll rest her head on these broad babies.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.824
Feel 'em.

03:22.902 --> 03:25.700
Rock hard, amigo.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.036
Man, you don't wantJackie
leaning on your shoulders.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.268
- They're all bruised.
- Where?

03:30.343 --> 03:32.470
( Groans )

03:32.545 --> 03:37.073
Man, I should really
see those coming by now.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.710
Oh! Watch the gun,
Cool Hand Luke.

03:39.786 --> 03:43.722
Will you relax, Eric?
God, guns don't just go off by accident.

03:46.125 --> 03:50.585
Really? Well, what about Eric's
fourth-grade hamster, Snowball?

03:50.663 --> 03:54.497
Oh, no, Snowball wasn't shot. He went
upstate to live with a nice farm family.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.662
You shot Snowball?

04:00.740 --> 04:05.074
Well, the gun went off
by accident!

04:08.414 --> 04:11.281
Oh, sweet pea,
I'm here for you.

04:11.351 --> 04:15.014
Steven, my dad's going to prison.
What am I gonna do?

04:16.322 --> 04:19.257
Um, bake him a cake
with a file in it?

04:22.629 --> 04:24.893
What do you want me to say?

04:24.964 --> 04:29.526
Nothing. Look, I just-
Oh, never mind.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.730
Now we're talking.
Donna, give her a kiss.

Yes, I know.
Because you told me 20 times!

Wait. I thought Mr. Roper from

Oh, he's there too.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.460
Bug-eyed bastard.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.307
At first I thought they
were just killing time.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.371
- But Nina-
- But now I actually think they're getting serious.

05:49.449 --> 05:50.780
- But Nina-
-Jackie and Hyde-

06:12.038 --> 06:14.370

- Hey.
- Hey.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.431
Donna, what are you doing
wearing the engagement ring?

06:43.503 --> 06:47.564
It's supposed to be a secret.
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

06:47.640 --> 06:51.940
Yeah, Eric, I have no self-control,
so I told the pretzel guy at the park.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.808
( Laughs )
Okay.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.940
Seriously, I have no self-control,
and I told the pretzel guy at the park.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.109
- Donna!
- I'm sorry.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.380
I'm excited.
I had to tell someone.

07:01.454 --> 07:04.855
Plus, uh, free pretzel.

What's wrong, Steven?
Problems with Jackie?

07:09.796 --> 07:12.026
Yeah, I said the wrong thing.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.431
Well, I have menopause.
Do you have menopause?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.570
Uh, no.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.368

07:23.075 --> 07:26.977
I'm sorry.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.048
tell me what happened.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.050
( Clears Throat )
Well...

07:32.118 --> 07:35.645
she wanted me to say something to make her
feel better, and I couldn't think of anything.

07:35.721 --> 07:40.488
Well, Steven, you don't know how to comfort
people, because you've never been comforted.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.690
No, that's not true. One time, my dad felt
so bad about missing my Little League game...

07:44.764 --> 07:48.359
that he made up for it
by disappearing for nine years.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.834
Well, after what you've been through...

07:50.903 --> 07:52.996
you don't have to be nice to anybody.

07:53.072 --> 07:55.404
Jackie can just leave you alone.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.842
Now I'm just- I'm gonna
go upstairs and cry a little.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.141
Problems with Jackie, huh?

08:01.214 --> 08:06.049
Hyde, I'd like to remind you that Donna
and I are basically the perfect couple.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.921
We really are.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.255

- Go to her.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.001
What?

08:23.069 --> 08:25.060
No, he needs to be with her.

08:25.137 --> 08:28.903
No, he needs to give her space.
When your mom left, I gave you space.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.068
I didn't want space.
I wanted you with me.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.839
- You didn't tell me that.
- I couldn't find you!

08:36.082 --> 08:38.880
And they lived
happily ever after.

08:42.655 --> 08:46.523
Fingerprinting is one of the most
important jobs at the D.M.V., Fez.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.378
No. No, I can't.

But- But I am

Uh-huh.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.446
Wow, that is

10:22.188 --> 10:26.522
Red,Jackie's been moping
in our kitchen for an hour.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.060
So call the cops.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.892
I don't want her arrested.
I want to help her.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.398
She needs a father figure.
Go talk to her.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.627
- No.
- Yes!

10:35.701 --> 10:37.635
- No.
- Red!

10:37.703 --> 10:40.433
Fine. Every damn argument!

10:40.506 --> 10:43.566
You'd think I'd win one,
just by chance.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.371
- Mr. Forman-
- Look,Jackie...

10:49.448 --> 10:53.748
I know that things seem grim,
but your father's rich, right?

10:53.819 --> 10:57.311
- Uh-huh.
- Well, then I'm sure that whatever trouble he's in...

10:57.390 --> 10:59.688
he'll buy his way out
and wriggle free.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.823
You're right.
I mean, this is America.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.005
The rich are treated
differently here.

11:06.138 --> 11:10.905
Yep. And I'm so glad I took
some shrapnel to make that happen.

11:10.976 --> 11:13.467
Me too.

11:16.782 --> 11:18.943
So, Hyde, have you
talked toJackie yet?

11:19.018 --> 11:23.955
'Cause don't- 'Cause you gotta
give her room to breathe, man.

11:25.624 --> 11:28.149
Yeah. And if she ever
falls out of a plane...

11:28.227 --> 11:30.320
just let her fall.

11:30.396 --> 11:33.490
What, he's supposed to
just jump out after her?

11:33.565 --> 11:36.261
Well, at least
they'll be together.

11:36.335 --> 11:38.735
Man, I don't getJackie.

11:38.804 --> 11:40.999
I mean, we were
together for years...

11:41.073 --> 11:44.565
and the second I turn my back,
she off and Frenches Hyde.

11:44.643 --> 11:47.635
And by ''turn your back,''
you mean ditching her for two months...

11:47.713 --> 11:50.580
to have sex
with random beach trash?

11:52.084 --> 11:54.678

- Chasing me is futile!

- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:04.056 --> 13:06.286
The BB just winged
my shoulder.

13:06.358 --> 13:08.690

to be taught a lesson.

13:08.761 --> 13:11.059
Hyde, it was an accident.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.064
No, it wasn't.

13:13.132 --> 13:15.692
He's been bitching about me
and Jackie since he found out.

13:15.768 --> 13:18.703
Now he got himself
so out of control that he shot me.

13:18.771 --> 13:21.501
I don't like getting shot!

13:21.573 --> 13:24.701
So now I'm gonna punish him
the way my parents punish me.

13:24.777 --> 13:27.371
You're gonna leave him
at the mall?

13:30.549 --> 13:34.713
No. I'm gonna milk this eye thing
until he feels as bad as he should.

13:34.787 --> 13:38.723
They didn't leave me at the mall.
They forgot me.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.725

14:16.762 --> 14:21.028
Well, maybe we wouldn't be so comfortable
if we just gave each other some space.

14:27.139 --> 14:31.303
- Don't make me hit you.
- Well, good luck reaching me
through all the space.

14:34.947 --> 14:37.279
Hey, guys. Is Hyde here?

14:38.484 --> 14:40.418
Hyde?

14:49.828 --> 14:52.820
Hey, Hyde. I brought you this.

14:53.832 --> 14:55.857
What is it? I can't see.

14:59.338 --> 15:03.206
Well, it's most of a burger.

15:03.275 --> 15:07.974
I took a bite, 'cause I'm sorry,
but I'm also hungry.

15:08.046 --> 15:13.040
Yeah, well, it's almost 2:00.
I gotta go flush out my eye.

15:16.922 --> 15:21.018
You guys, how bad is it?
Is Hyde gonna be a cyclops?

15:22.794 --> 15:27.629
Kelso, what were you thinking?
I mean, did you shoot him on purpose?

15:27.699 --> 15:30.395
No! The gun went off
on accident!

15:31.503 --> 15:33.664
Well, he kinda thinks
you did.

15:33.739 --> 15:36.731
How could I?
I mean, yeah, I was mad.

15:36.808 --> 15:39.299
But I didn't-
I don't know.

15:39.378 --> 15:43.371
Maybe I did it
accidentally on purpose.

15:43.448 --> 15:47.782
- You mean subconsciously?
- No, I was definitely awake the whole time.

15:52.324 --> 15:54.656
Steven, I'm glad
your eye's not hurt.

15:54.726 --> 15:58.856
Even though you deserve it
because you were such a jerk about my dad.

15:58.931 --> 16:02.799
Man, look,Jackie-
( Sighs )

16:02.868 --> 16:06.565
I'm never gonna be the guy who says
the right thing at the right time.

16:06.638 --> 16:08.572
Okay? I'm just not.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.872
You are so full of it. All I'm asking for
is a gesture, and you can't even do that.

16:12.945 --> 16:15.971
( Clears Throat )
Okay, I got something.

16:17.316 --> 16:19.841
Get your dad
a carton of cigarettes...

16:19.918 --> 16:22.819
so he can trade 'em for
not being someone's wife.

16:24.556 --> 16:27.957
- Oh,just forget it.
- No. No.

16:28.026 --> 16:29.960
Jackie, that's funny.

16:30.028 --> 16:34.624
Look, when my dad went to prison, that's what
someone told me to make me feel better.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.362
It was my mom!
We had a real good laugh!

16:42.374 --> 16:45.866
Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
can you settle this for us?

16:45.944 --> 16:48.276
If someone you love
is kinda depressed...

16:48.347 --> 16:51.009
should you shower them
with kindness or give them space?

16:51.083 --> 16:54.109
Well, now, that's
a very good question.

16:56.054 --> 17:00.150
And it really takes a lot of living
with someone to get it right.

17:00.225 --> 17:03.854
- That's true.
- But you'll find the thing to do is-

17:03.929 --> 17:05.988
- Give them space.
- shower them.

17:09.468 --> 17:11.992
What did you say?

17:12.069 --> 17:14.470
I said what you said.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.906
You're lying.

17:17.976 --> 17:19.910
Oh, come on, Kitty!

17:19.978 --> 17:23.003
When menopause
makes you crazy...

17:23.080 --> 17:26.517
I could be with you all day
and it wouldn't do any good.

17:26.585 --> 17:29.850
You need space.

17:31.390 --> 17:35.383
Oh. Menopause
makes me crazy?

17:37.029 --> 17:39.190
I'm crazy?

17:39.264 --> 17:42.165
I'm crazy?

17:42.234 --> 17:45.726
Well, if you want space,
Red Forman, you got it!

17:45.804 --> 17:50.332
This crazy lady's
out the crazy door!

18:00.585 --> 18:03.383
We were having a nice lunch.

18:06.591 --> 18:09.822
( Clattering )

18:11.496 --> 18:15.489
Okay, Hyde, I feel really bad,
and I shouldn't have shot you.

18:15.567 --> 18:18.365
And I think that I might've
done it on purpose...

18:18.437 --> 18:21.167
'cause I'm not okay with you and Jackie...

18:21.239 --> 18:23.503
and I don't know if I ever will be.

18:23.575 --> 18:28.035
But I'm almost positive that
I'll never, ever shoot you again.

18:28.113 --> 18:31.082
But the only way to be sure
is for you to shoot me.

18:31.149 --> 18:34.312
I've always responded really
well to corporal punishment.

18:34.386 --> 18:38.288
So, here.

18:40.158 --> 18:42.683
Do it. Shoot me.

18:43.962 --> 18:46.294
This is like <i>Old Yeller.</i>

18:46.365 --> 18:50.096
Come on, man.
Just do it. Right here.

18:50.168 --> 18:52.227
It's the only way.

18:52.304 --> 18:55.000
Okay.

18:55.073 --> 18:57.268
- You lied!
- ( Gunshot )

18:57.342 --> 19:00.505
( Groans )
You're dead, man!

19:05.717 --> 19:08.515
So, how's stuff
with your dad?

19:08.587 --> 19:12.614
Well, my mom's flying home from
the Fiesta de las Margaritas...

19:12.691 --> 19:15.159
so I guess it's pretty serious.

19:15.227 --> 19:17.320
Wow, that is serious.

19:17.396 --> 19:19.387
<i>Playboy</i> voted
Fiesta de las Margaritas...

19:19.464 --> 19:21.659
Latin America's
number one singles party.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.768
But I-
( Clears Throat )

19:24.836 --> 19:27.464
I'm sure she's just there
for the margaritas.

19:27.539 --> 19:31.270
Oh, my God, you guys,
my whole world is just falling apart.

19:31.343 --> 19:33.277
Oh.

19:35.881 --> 19:38.076
Hey.

19:39.518 --> 19:43.147
Steven!
You shaved your beard off!.

19:43.221 --> 19:45.587
- I thought it might cheer you up.
- Oh, my God.

19:45.657 --> 19:47.887
You shaved it off for me.

19:47.959 --> 19:51.827
You let the razor say the words
your mouth couldn't speak.

19:53.932 --> 19:56.730
- ( Together) Aww.
- Shut up!

19:58.437 --> 20:00.530
( Squeals )

20:00.605 --> 20:04.632
So I guess the answer to the problem
wasn't more or less space.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.904
It was more or less hair.

20:06.978 --> 20:09.173
And that's bizarre.

20:09.247 --> 20:13.013
Okay, I've been thinking about it-
about the space thing, and I got it.

20:13.084 --> 20:17.487
You'll talk about stuff,
and I'll just leave.

20:18.690 --> 20:20.624
And I'll follow you.

20:20.692 --> 20:23.456
Because I'm strong enough
to take you down and make you listen.

20:23.528 --> 20:28.465
And I will let you lie on me
and pretend that it bothers me.

20:31.636 --> 20:34.969
Guys, something horrible
has happened.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.874
The little man in my pants
has turned black.

20:43.715 --> 20:45.649
It's not funny!

20:47.152 --> 20:49.950
Black is the color of death!

20:52.057 --> 20:55.925
Oh, my little man is going to die
before he gets to see the world.

21:00.198 --> 21:02.428
I'm so sorry.

21:05.904 --> 21:08.429
How could this happen?

21:09.741 --> 21:11.675
How?

21:19.117 --> 21:24.384
Okay, I washed. But the ink
isn't coming off my little man. Help.

21:24.456 --> 21:27.186
You should try bleach.

21:28.960 --> 21:32.987
- Ooh. Or Comet.
- Yeah. Or steel wool.

21:33.064 --> 21:35.089
Hey, and if all else fails...

21:35.166 --> 21:38.363
the one thing that
gets out ink is more ink.

21:38.436 --> 21:42.372
That's right, Hyde. Whatever you
do, use the steel wool first.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.136
Really scrub
so the soap gets in there.

21:45.210 --> 21:49.010
Remember, if it doesn't sting,
it's not working.
