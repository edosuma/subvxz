THE POWER OF MUSIC.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.633
WHETHER A CONCERTO
OR BALLAD OR RAP,

01:54.633 --> 01:56.967
MUSIC STIMULATES US.

01:56.967 --> 01:59.600
YEAH, IT STIMULATES US.

02:10.867 --> 02:12.100
HEY !

02:12.100 --> 02:14.467
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING
A FAREWELL CONVERSATION.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.533
USE YOUR LIPS
FOR TALKING.

02:16.533 --> 02:18.133
ASSHOLE.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.467
YOU GIRLS
GOT ONE MINUTE.

02:19.467 --> 02:20.667
HEY, ASSHOLE.

02:20.667 --> 02:21.867
CHRIS, COME ON.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.233
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

02:23.233 --> 02:25.900
THERE'S A LOT I WANT
TO SAY BEFORE I GO.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.734
LOOK, I'VE GOT
TO TELL YA,

02:27.734 --> 02:29.800
I'M HAVING
A TOUGH TIME

02:29.800 --> 02:32.266
WRAPPING MY HEAD
AROUND THE REALITY
OF YOU BEING PAROLED.

02:32.266 --> 02:34.467
TRUST ME, I WON'T
FULLY COMPREHEND IT

02:34.467 --> 02:36.533
UNTIL I'M SIPPING
MY FIRST MARTINI.

02:36.533 --> 02:40.033
TOBY, I'M...

02:40.033 --> 02:43.200
( bell ringing )

02:43.200 --> 02:45.700
I'M...

02:46.900 --> 02:49.400
WHAT ?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.467
I'M GLAD...

02:56.467 --> 03:01.467
YOU'RE FINALLY GOING TO GET SOME
TIME TO SPEND WITH YOUR KIDS.

03:01.467 --> 03:02.800
COME ON.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.967
WHAT'S REALLY
ON YOUR MIND ?

03:04.967 --> 03:06.467
DON'T FORGET ME.

03:06.467 --> 03:08.433
NEVER.

03:08.433 --> 03:11.300
AND NOW THAT I'M OUT,

03:11.300 --> 03:13.700
I'LL BE DOUBLING MY EFFORTS
TO OVERTURN YOUR DEATH SENTENCE.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.300
I'M GOING TO SEE YOU
MORE THAN BEFORE.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.433
EVEN SO, IF I DIE,
DON'T FORGET ME.

03:17.433 --> 03:20.033
YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO DIE.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.934
WHEN YOU SAY IT,
I ALMOST BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.166
IT IS TRUE.

03:26.533 --> 03:29.000
TIME.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.467
TIME !

03:36.467 --> 03:37.633
ASSHOLE.

03:37.633 --> 03:39.734
CHRIS, DON'T !

03:54.767 --> 03:56.433
HEY, YOU GOT
ANYTHING FOR ME ?

03:56.433 --> 03:57.533
NOPE.

03:57.533 --> 04:00.633
I LOVE MY ROSIE.

04:01.734 --> 04:03.066
MARICON !

04:03.066 --> 04:05.333
THANKS.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.367
( knocking )

04:17.367 --> 04:19.100
MAYOR LOEWEN.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.633
VERNIE,

04:20.633 --> 04:23.100
I WONDERED
WHEN YOU'D POP UP.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.367
IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU, SIR.

04:25.367 --> 04:27.400
IS THAT MAIL
FOR ME ?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.433
OH, YES.

04:33.166 --> 04:36.000
SO, ARE YOU COMFORTABLE,
GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED ?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.200
YEAH, MM-HMM.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.633
YOU GAVE ME
QUITE A SCARE,

04:40.633 --> 04:43.433
WELL, WHEN I HEARD YOU
ALMOST CHOCKED TO DEATH.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.567
WHEN'S THE DOCTOR
RELEASING YOU ?

04:49.567 --> 04:52.333
I GO BACK TO
UNIT "J" TOMORROW.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.567
CHRIST.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.467
SIR ?

04:56.467 --> 04:58.300
ANOTHER HATE LETTER.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.066
SOME NIGGER SAYS
I GOT OFF TOO EASY.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.000
HE SAYS HE'S GOT A COUSIN
HERE IN OSWALD

05:03.000 --> 05:05.767
WHO'S GONNA
AIRHOLE ME.

05:05.767 --> 05:07.700
WHAT DOES
AIRHOLE MEAN ?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.934
KILL.

05:12.066 --> 05:13.767
BLACK BASTARD.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.800
DON'T WORRY,
YOUR HONOR,

05:15.800 --> 05:18.000
I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.467
OH, YEAH,
IS THAT RIGHT, HUH ?

05:20.467 --> 05:22.667
WELL, FROM WHAT I HEAR
THE ARYANS IN OSWALD

05:22.667 --> 05:24.233
ARE A SORRY BUNCH.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.934
THAT GUY WHO SAVED ME
FROM CHOKING, BEECHER.

05:26.934 --> 05:30.200
I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN
TRYING TO AIRHOLE HIM

05:30.200 --> 05:32.967
FOR ABOUT SIX FUCKING YEARS
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT

05:32.967 --> 05:35.700
IS THAT LITTLE SCAR
ABOVE YOUR EYE THERE.

05:35.700 --> 05:39.066
I DID HAVE HIS SON KILLED
AND HIS FATHER.

05:39.066 --> 05:41.100
WHAT ARE YOU
AN IDIOT ?

05:41.100 --> 05:43.333
SAYING SHIT
LIKE THAT OUT LOUD ?

05:43.333 --> 05:45.900
YOU KNOW, VERNIE,
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU

05:45.900 --> 05:47.400
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE BRIGHTEST BULB

05:47.400 --> 05:48.800
IN THE CHANDELIER.

05:48.800 --> 05:52.100
YOU ALWAYS HAD THIS HUGE EGO
WITH NOTHING TO BACK IT UP.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.800
YOU ALWAYS HAD THESE BIG PLANS
WITH NO BALLS BEHIND THEM.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.667
SHIT.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.433
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOUR DADDY,

05:59.433 --> 06:02.233
I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN YOU
THE TIME OF FUCKING DAY.

06:02.233 --> 06:05.233
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT
TO THE BROTHERHOOD.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.233
I HAVE BALLS.

06:09.233 --> 06:12.734
SPEAK UP, BOY,
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

06:12.734 --> 06:15.233
NOTHING, SIR.

06:15.233 --> 06:17.200
( buzzer )

06:30.200 --> 06:32.166
HOW'D YOUR MEETING
WITH THE MAYOR GO ?

06:32.166 --> 06:34.200
FUCK HIM.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.967
WELL, IT'S BEEN
NICE KNOWING YOU.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.600
YOU, TOO, YOOD.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.200
YOU, TOO, YOOD ?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.967
( laughing )

06:50.967 --> 06:53.233
WELL, YOU'RE IN
SUCH A CHEERY MOOD

06:53.233 --> 06:56.633
I'M NOT SURE IF
I SHOULD BURDEN YOU

06:56.633 --> 06:59.133
WITH THE LITTLE INFO
I JUST LEARNED.

07:03.033 --> 07:05.233
I KNOW WHO KILLED
YOUR FATHER.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.033
WHO ?

07:09.033 --> 07:11.500
FRANKLIN WINTHROP

07:11.500 --> 07:15.100
ON ORDERS FROM
VERN SCHILLINGER.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.367
I KNEW IT.

07:17.367 --> 07:20.700
FUCK.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.500
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT THE FACTS NOW

07:24.500 --> 07:29.066
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO DO
SOMETHING BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

07:29.066 --> 07:31.266
LIKE WHAT ?

07:31.266 --> 07:33.633
SCHILLINGER MURDERED
YOUR FATHER.

07:33.633 --> 07:38.600
WILSON LOEWEN'S LIKE
A FATHER TO SCHILLINGER.

07:38.600 --> 07:43.000
TOOTH FOR TOOTH TIME.

07:49.633 --> 07:54.066
SO, I SAID, "RONNIE, YOU TELL
NANCY TO KEEP HER PANTIES ON."

07:54.066 --> 07:55.734
( laughing )

07:55.734 --> 07:57.166
AND DID HE ?

07:57.166 --> 07:58.867
HELL, NO, WHEN IT
CAME TO THAT WOMAN,

07:58.867 --> 08:01.000
THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR
HAD NO VOICE AT ALL.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.767
THIS HAS BEEN
ENJOYABLE, MAYOR,

08:03.767 --> 08:06.600
BUT I HAVE A MEETING
OVER AT LARDNER.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.066
YEAH, I HAVE
TO RUN AS WELL.

08:09.066 --> 08:12.033
JIMMY, COULD YOU STAY
JUST TWO MORE MINUTES ?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.266
AH, YEAH.

08:14.266 --> 08:15.934
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.133
OH, I HOPE SO,
DARLIN'.

08:21.633 --> 08:24.400
YOU FUCKING
COCKSUCKER.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.266
YOU SWORE TO ME THAT YOU WOULD
NEVER LET ME SERVE A DAY...

08:27.266 --> 08:30.200
WILSON, THEY WERE
BURNING DOWN THE CITY.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.333
CORRECTION !

08:31.333 --> 08:32.934
THEY WERE BURNING
DOWN THEIR CITY,

08:32.934 --> 08:35.033
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD,
THEIR BUSINESSES.

08:35.033 --> 08:37.233
THE VIOLENCE WAS
ESCALATING, SPREADING--

08:37.233 --> 08:38.734
SO, YOU SEND IN
THE NATIONAL GUARD,

08:38.734 --> 08:40.800
TEAR GAS, RUBBER BULLETS.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.467
WHAT YOU DON'T DO IS
BETRAY A LIFELONG FRIEND.

08:42.467 --> 08:45.600
WHAT YOU DON'T DO
IS HUMILIATE A MAN,

08:45.600 --> 08:49.633
ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MAN KNOWS
WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.834
I WANT MY PARDON, JIMMY,
AND I WANT IT FUCKING TODAY.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.166
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND
ANOTHER NIGHT IN THIS CESSPOOL.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.133
I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF
POLITICAL TYPHOON IT CAUSES.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.567
IF YOU DON'T
GIVE ME MY PARDON,

09:03.567 --> 09:06.934
I WILL CALL A PRESS CONFERENCE
AND I WILL TELL TALES, JIMMY,

09:06.934 --> 09:09.700
TALES OF CORRUPTION,
TALES OF GRAFT,

09:09.700 --> 09:11.333
TALES OF VOTER FRAUD.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.333
BY THE TIME I'M FINISHED, YOU'LL
BE SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ME

09:14.333 --> 09:17.066
IN UNIT "J" PLAYING
PAR-FUCKING-CHEESI.

09:17.066 --> 09:19.133
ALRIGHT.

09:19.133 --> 09:22.734
I'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY.

09:22.734 --> 09:26.600
YEAH, YOU ALWAYS DO, JIMMY,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE MY BOY.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.700
PERRY,

09:34.700 --> 09:38.867
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO DO,

09:38.867 --> 09:44.400
SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES
ENORMOUS DISCRETION.

09:49.467 --> 09:52.000
( buzzer )

09:52.000 --> 09:54.533
SO, HERE WE ARE.

09:54.533 --> 09:56.934
YES.

09:59.467 --> 10:03.066
BUT I'M NOT SAYING GOODBYE
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOODBYE.

10:03.066 --> 10:07.033
MY DAD'S LAW PARTNERS,
IN HIS MEMORY,

10:07.033 --> 10:09.633
HAVE DECIDED TO DO PRO BONO WORK
FOR THE PRISONERS.

10:09.633 --> 10:11.600
EVEN THOUGH
I'VE BEEN DISBARRED,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.400
I'M GOING TO COORDINATE
THE OFFICE.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.667
THAT'S GREAT.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.066
I'M GLAD, TOBIAS.

10:16.066 --> 10:18.200
I'M GLAD THAT SOME GOOD
WILL COME OUT OF

10:18.200 --> 10:19.934
ALL THE SADNESS
YOU'VE SUFFERED.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.834
I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH
FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.133
THANK YOU.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.000
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.300
TOBIAS, DO NOT
COME BACK TOMORROW.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.600
BE WITH YOUR FAMILY.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.300
TAKE THE TIME TO PLAY
WITH YOUR CHILDREN.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.900
AND COMFORT MY MOTHER.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.767
I PROMISE YOU, BEECHER,

10:53.767 --> 10:57.533
I WILL FIND
WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER.

10:57.533 --> 11:01.767
YEAH, UH-HUH.

11:01.767 --> 11:05.100
HEY, BEECHER,
SIGN HERE.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.533
( bell ringing )

11:10.533 --> 11:12.667
OKAY.

11:12.667 --> 11:16.066
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

11:26.066 --> 11:27.500
FREE TO GO.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.066
FREE.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.900
FREE.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.834
BE WELL.

11:52.767 --> 11:55.867

"ONE GOOD THING ABOUT MUSIC,
WHEN IT HITS YOU FEEL NO PAIN.

11:55.867 --> 11:59.000

BOB MARLEY.

12:02.533 --> 12:05.533
( screaming )

12:36.433 --> 12:38.033
WILSON LOEWEN
IS DEAD.

12:38.033 --> 12:40.467
OH.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.800
WELL...

12:42.800 --> 12:45.367
OH, WELL.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.467
OH.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.567
WELL.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.700
IT AMAZES ME SOME OF THE BOOKS
THE PRISONERS READ.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.834
I MEAN,
HENRY JAMES ?

12:57.834 --> 13:01.533
THEY HAD TO FORCE-FEED ME
JAMES IN COLLEGE.

13:01.533 --> 13:05.800
I, TOO THOUGHT IT ODD THAT
PABLO ROSA WOULD WANT TO BORROW

13:05.800 --> 13:07.300
"THE AMBASSADORS."

13:07.300 --> 13:08.700
HE'S 18,

13:08.700 --> 13:12.567
IN FOR MURDERING
A CLASSMATE.

13:12.567 --> 13:15.500
NICE TO KNOW
HE'S EXPANDING HIS HORIZONS.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.800
TURN THE BOOK OVER.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.900
IS THAT BLOOD ?

13:20.900 --> 13:24.166
HE CLUBBED
HIS CELLMATE WITH IT.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.467
PABLO ROSA, HUH ?

13:26.467 --> 13:29.033
WHAT CELL BLOCK'S
HE IN ?

13:29.033 --> 13:30.400
WHY ?

13:30.400 --> 13:32.066
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO HELP PEOPLE,

13:32.066 --> 13:34.066
BUT YOU CAN'T
REACH A KID LIKE THAT.

13:34.066 --> 13:36.433
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY I SHOULD TRY.

13:36.433 --> 13:42.400
DOESN'T YOUR BOYFRIEND WORRY,
YOU COMING IN HERE EVERY DAY ?

13:43.767 --> 13:47.900
IS THAT YOUR NOT-SO-SUBTLE WAY
OF ASKING IF I'M "INVOLVED" ?

13:47.900 --> 13:49.433
YES.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.433
WELL, ROBERT,

13:51.433 --> 13:53.567
TO ME,

13:53.567 --> 13:57.300
MEN ARE LIKE BOOKS.

13:57.300 --> 14:00.200
SOMETIMES I WANT
A ROMANCE,

14:00.200 --> 14:02.467
SOMETIMES A THRILLER,

14:02.467 --> 14:06.567
SOMETIMES MAYBE A TRASHY NOVEL
TO TAKE TO THE BEACH.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.700
AND SOMETIMES,

14:08.700 --> 14:10.734
I WANT A CLASSIC.

14:10.734 --> 14:13.266
BUT WHEN I FINISH,

14:13.266 --> 14:15.633
IT'S BACK ON THE SHELVES
AND ON TO THE NEXT.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.300
YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN MARRIED.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.000
OH, NO.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.767
THEN MAYBE
YOU'RE READING TOO FAST.

14:22.767 --> 14:25.667

15:12.667 --> 15:14.600
COME ON IN.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.467
( bell ringing )

15:22.200 --> 15:23.800
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

15:23.800 --> 15:25.734
I'VE BEEN READING
THROUGH YOUR RECORDS.

15:25.734 --> 15:29.300
YOU'RE 18, WITH 18 YEARS
LEFT ON YOUR SENTENCE.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.400
I GET PAROLE IN 10.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.934
OKAY.

15:32.934 --> 15:35.567
SO, HOW DO YOU WANT
TO SPEND THAT TIME ?

15:35.567 --> 15:37.834
FAST AS
FUCKING POSSIBLE.

15:37.834 --> 15:42.000
THE THING IS, PABLO,
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.667
ANY MORE THAN
THIS IS A WEAPON.

15:45.667 --> 15:49.133
DID THE JOB PRETTY GOOD,
IF YOU ASK ME.

15:49.133 --> 15:52.033
NOT THE JOB
IT WAS MEANT TO.

15:52.033 --> 15:55.133
TELL ME,
CAN YOU READ ?

15:55.133 --> 15:56.934
SURE.

15:56.934 --> 15:58.533
DO YOU ENJOY IT ?

15:58.533 --> 16:00.033
NO.

16:00.033 --> 16:01.567
BOOKS ARE JUST
SHIT TEACHERS GIVE YOU.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.100
SO, YOU DID
GO TO SCHOOL.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.367
SOMETIMES.

16:04.367 --> 16:05.834
BUT NOT ALWAYS,

16:05.834 --> 16:07.934
BECAUSE YOU HATED THE SHIT
YOUR TEACHERS GAVE YOU, RIGHT ?

16:07.934 --> 16:09.233
UH-HUH.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.734
WELL, CAN'T EXPECT EVERYONE
TO ENJOY THE SAME THINGS,

16:11.734 --> 16:13.133
SO, WHAT I'D LIKE US
TO DO IS

16:13.133 --> 16:15.667
FIND A BOOK THAT'S
RIGHT FOR YOU.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.166
WHY ?

16:17.166 --> 16:18.800
BECAUSE WHEN WE DO,
IT'LL MAKE THE TIME FLY,

16:18.800 --> 16:20.467
AND THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

16:20.467 --> 16:24.433
TELL ME SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT INTEREST YOU.

16:24.433 --> 16:25.767
LIKE WHAT ?

16:25.767 --> 16:28.033
LIKE PUSSY
AND BASEBALL ?

16:28.033 --> 16:30.900
NOW, WE'RE COOKIN'.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.000
HEY, REBADOW, HEARD
YOU WERE IN THE LIBRARY,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
CHECKING OUT MORE
THAN JUST BOOKS.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.367
I DON'T REALLY CARE TO DIGNIFY
THAT WITH A RESPONSE.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.000
CHILL, MAN.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.500
I'M JUST A LITTLE
JEALOUS, YOU KNOW ?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.967
YOU GOT YOUR OLD LADY
ON PAYROLL, RIGHT ?

16:47.967 --> 16:50.233
I CALL MINE TWICE.

16:50.233 --> 16:52.233
SHE WON'T EVEN
SO MUCH AS FART MY WAY.

16:52.233 --> 16:57.967
YOU AND BUSMALIS
SHOULD SWITCH PLACES.

16:57.967 --> 17:00.233
HIS GIRL KEEPS SHOWING UP,
BUT HE WON'T SEE HER.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.600
WELL, SHIT, LET ME KNOW
THE NEXT TIME SHE COMES BY.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.600
SHIT, I'LL VISIT ANYTHING
IN A SKIRT, MAN.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.967
NORMA'S HERE TODAY.

17:07.967 --> 17:10.300
FOR SOME REASON,
SHE ASKED FOR ME.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.300
WELL, SHIT,
SHARE THE LOVE.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.133
SHARE THE LOVE.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.467
DAMN !

17:18.934 --> 17:22.734
YOU THINK I CAN CONVINCE
BUSMALIS TO VISIT WITH YOU,

17:22.734 --> 17:24.133
BUT I CAN'T.

17:24.133 --> 17:25.900
HE'S IMPENETRABLE.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.567
OH, COME ON.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.333
WE BOTH KNOW
AGAMEMNON.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.834
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WALL
IS ONLY AN INCH THICK

17:31.834 --> 17:34.166
OVER THAT TENDER
LITTLE HEART OF HIS.

17:34.166 --> 17:37.800
WELL, I'M NO
CARDIAC SURGEON.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.000
I'M NOT SURE HOW TO
CUT THROUGH THE WALL.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.867
SAY YOU SAW ME,

17:41.867 --> 17:43.800
THAT I WAS CRYING.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.900
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.300
BUT I DO,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.333
EVERY DAY.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.834
AND TELL HIM THIS,

17:51.834 --> 17:54.400
I'LL SHOW UP
ONE LAST TIME.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.900
IF HE DOESN'T COME,
EVEN JUST TO SAY FAREWELL,

17:57.900 --> 18:01.934
THEN I SWEAR, HE'LL NEVER
HEAR FROM NORMA CLARK AGAIN.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.734
OKAY.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.934
BUT I CAN'T
PROMISE SUCCESS.

18:05.934 --> 18:07.967
PLEASE,  BOB.

18:07.967 --> 18:11.333
DO YOUR BEST.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.433
SEE ?

18:13.433 --> 18:16.100
TEARS.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.834
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ?

18:22.834 --> 18:24.800
YOU KNOW I HATE
PLAYING SOLITAIRE ALONE.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.767
BLACK FOUR
ON THAT FIVE.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.133
AND THIS IS WHY.

18:30.133 --> 18:33.533
I JUST SAW NORMA.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.266
WHAT, MY NORMA ?

18:35.266 --> 18:36.867
AGAMEMNON,
CALM DOWN.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.266
WENT BEHIND MY BACK.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.233
IS THERE A REASON
EVERYONE'S TAKING HER SIDE ?

18:40.233 --> 18:42.367
I'M OF THE MIND YOU'RE BOTH
ON THE SAME SIDE.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.000
OH ?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.867
AND WHAT ARE YOU,
DR. LOVE ?

18:45.867 --> 18:48.934
AND WHAT'S LED YOU
TO SUCH A LEARNED DIAGNOSIS ?

18:48.934 --> 18:52.166
FOR ONE, YOU CALLED HER
"MY NORMA".

18:52.166 --> 18:56.300
YOU'VE GOT 12 YEARS
LEFT IN OZ.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.667
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEND
THAT TIME ANGRY AND DESOLATE ?

18:59.667 --> 19:03.266
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ?

19:03.266 --> 19:05.834
YOU'RE BUSY MOONING
OVER THAT LIBRARIAN.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.300
YES.

19:07.300 --> 19:11.000
STELLA'S CONJURED UP
ALL SORTS OF FEELINGS IN ME,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.233
REMINDING ME OF WHAT
I WAS LIKE WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

19:14.233 --> 19:16.600
PASSIONATE
ABOUT ARCHITECTURE,

19:16.600 --> 19:18.066
ABOUT BETTY.

19:18.066 --> 19:21.400
I WAS ON THE VERGE OF
AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER,

19:21.400 --> 19:22.967
AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE.

19:22.967 --> 19:25.900
BUT I'VE BEEN
ALONE 38 YEARS,

19:25.900 --> 19:28.600
AND I'M JUST BEGINNING
TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.233
YOU, YOU'RE CHOOSING
TO LOSE THE TIME

19:31.233 --> 19:33.900
YOU AND NORMA
HAVE TOGETHER.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.767
RED QUEEN
ON THAT KING.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.934
YEAH, YEAH,
I SEE IT.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.567
LITTLE MAN, WHAT WAS
THAT BULLSHIT ?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.500
YOU DIDN'T LIKE
"OF HUMAN BONDAGE" ?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.100
I THOUGHT IT WAS
AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.967
IT'S ABOUT
SOME CRIPPLED KID.

20:11.967 --> 20:13.700
THERE'S NO PICTURES,
EVEN.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.800
SORRY.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.767
UH...

20:17.767 --> 20:20.266
HOW ABOUT "MACBETH" ?

20:20.266 --> 20:22.333
THE STORY OF A BRUTAL
SCOTTISH WARLORD

20:22.333 --> 20:24.600
WHO KILLS MERCILESSLY
TO GAIN POWER.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.367
THEY'RE DOING
A PRODUCTION HERE.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.867
HEY, SOUNDS ALRIGHT.

20:27.867 --> 20:31.300
WELL, LADY MACBETH,
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.266
GET ME
MY FUCKING BOOK, MAN.

20:45.900 --> 20:49.533
HEY, DON'T FORGET
MY COOKIE.

20:49.533 --> 20:50.700
HEY, ROBSON.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.800
HEY, WHAT SHADE OF
LIPSTICK IS THAT, HUH ?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.533
IS IT DICK-SUCK RED ?

20:56.900 --> 21:00.500
YEAH, WE HEARD YOU'RE WORKING
RECEIVING AND DISCHARGE.

21:02.133 --> 21:03.633
UH-OH.

21:03.633 --> 21:05.233
FUCK YOU, PANCAMO.

21:05.233 --> 21:08.233
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, PRAG.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.100
THIS TIME, I'LL USE
MY BAD HAND TO BEAT YOU.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.367
EVEN IT UP
A LITTLE.

21:11.367 --> 21:12.400
BITCH !

21:12.400 --> 21:15.433
( shouting )

21:25.367 --> 21:27.900
( cheering )

21:29.233 --> 21:30.967
I WAS ONLY
TALKING.

21:30.967 --> 21:32.767
SINCE WHEN IS THAT
AGAINST THE RULES ?

21:32.767 --> 21:34.033
SINCE RIGHT NOW.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.066
SINCE RIGHT NOW.

21:35.066 --> 21:36.867
HEY, WHAT DID
I JUST SAY ?

21:36.867 --> 21:38.166
THIS IS THE PROBLEM,

21:38.166 --> 21:40.266
YOU GOT ZERO
LISTENING ABILITY,

21:40.266 --> 21:43.767
SO, FOCUS AND EITHER NOD
OR SHAKE YOUR HEAD, GOT IT ?

21:43.767 --> 21:46.400
THAT'S A START.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.066
SINCE REDDING PLANS
TO MOVE OVER TO TELEMARKETING,

21:49.066 --> 21:51.166
I'M GIVING YOU
BACK THE KITCHEN.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.867
KEEP IT EFFICIENT,

21:52.867 --> 21:54.900
KEEP IT CLEAN,

21:54.900 --> 21:56.867
KEEP IT HONEST.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.600
AND IN RETURN
FOR MY GENEROSITY,

21:59.600 --> 22:02.800
I WANT YOU TO STAY
THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE ARYANS.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.133
GOT ME ?

22:04.133 --> 22:07.667
NOW, THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU SAY THANKS.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.667
THANKS.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.633
YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:11.633 --> 22:13.667
SO, WHAT'D YOU GIVE
THOSE NAZI FUCKS ?

22:13.667 --> 22:16.834
AND NOW,
YOU SHUT UP AGAIN.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.333
PSST, WHITE.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.900

22:24.900 --> 22:26.767

22:30.100 --> 22:31.567
GOOD, NOT GREAT.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.133
THEY TELL YOU
WHAT WE GOT ?

22:33.133 --> 22:35.433
NAH, MAN, ONLY DRIBS
AND DRABS OF SHIT.

22:35.433 --> 22:36.934
YEAH, ME, TOO.

22:36.934 --> 22:38.600
HEY, IT CAN'T
BE THAT TERRIBLE

22:38.600 --> 22:40.767
IF NATHAN SENT US OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL THAT QUICK.

22:40.767 --> 22:42.700
I WANT
TO HEAR QUIET !

22:42.700 --> 22:44.333
YO, WHEN'S MARTINEZ
COMING BACK ?

22:44.333 --> 22:46.300
I DON'T KNOW.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.000
DID THEY TELL YOU
WHAT'S AILING US YET ?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.800
I DON'T KNOW !

22:51.467 --> 22:53.500
AH, SEE ?

22:53.500 --> 22:55.467
QUIET.

22:57.900 --> 23:01.266
LET'S GIVE GANNON

23:01.266 --> 23:03.367
CARLOS MARTINEZ...

23:03.367 --> 23:05.467
HE'S ONE NASTY MAN.

23:05.467 --> 23:08.500
HIS LIVER IS
DETERIORATING RAPIDLY.

23:08.500 --> 23:12.967
LET'S UP HIS
ALDACTONE 25 MILLIGRAMS.

23:15.900 --> 23:18.900

23:36.834 --> 23:38.433
MORALES IS WORRIED

23:38.433 --> 23:40.567
BRASS THE TRUTH ABOUT
HOW IS ANKLE GOT CUT.

23:40.567 --> 23:43.533
NO, I WOULD NEVER TELL,
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE.

23:43.533 --> 23:45.400
THAT'S WHAT MORALES
HAD IN MIND.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.233
HE WANTS ME
TO SHANK YOU.

23:47.233 --> 23:52.033
I'M TOO WEAK
TO FIGHT, CHICO.

24:00.266 --> 24:01.834
( Spanish )

24:01.834 --> 24:03.800
GRACIAS, HERMANO.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.700
STAY STRONG.

24:16.567 --> 24:17.667
IS IT DONE ?

24:17.667 --> 24:18.900
NO.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.834
I TALKED
TO MARTINEZ.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.133
HE'S NOT GONNA
JABBER ON YOU.

24:22.133 --> 24:23.900
I TOLD YOU
TO KILL HIM.

24:23.900 --> 24:25.800
THAT WAS AN ORDER.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.133
HE'S A COMPADRE.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.734
YOU WANT HIM
WHACKED ?

24:28.734 --> 24:30.967
DO THE DEED
YOURSELF.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.066
I WILL.

24:38.066 --> 24:40.767
AND I WON'T
FUCKIN' FORGET THIS.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.967
GRACE !

24:55.967 --> 24:57.266
HE'S DEAD.

24:57.266 --> 24:58.734
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED ?

24:58.734 --> 25:00.333
WELL, I WAS IN THE OFFICE
FILLING OUT REPORT SHEETS.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.066
I NEVER
HEARD HIM CODE.

25:02.066 --> 25:03.433
HOW DO YOU NOT
HEAR THE CODE ?

25:03.433 --> 25:04.667
WELL, I WAS BUSY.

25:04.667 --> 25:05.767
WELL, NOW YOU'RE NOT.

25:05.767 --> 25:07.333
YOU'RE FIRED.

25:15.133 --> 25:17.233
CARLOS MARTINEZ
IS DEAD.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.867
GODDAMN IT.

25:19.867 --> 25:23.400
HE DIED BECAUSE WE,
YOU AND ME,

25:23.400 --> 25:26.133
DIDN'T SEND HIM TO A REAL
HOSPITAL FOR PROPER CARE, LEO,

25:26.133 --> 25:27.266
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

25:27.266 --> 25:28.934
GLORIA.

25:28.934 --> 25:32.367
I HAVE TO DO AN AUTOPSY,
AND THIS TIME I AM NOT LYING.

25:32.367 --> 25:34.066
I'M NOT COVERING
ANYTHING UP.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.934

25:35.934 --> 25:39.000
DID YOU HEAR ME,

25:40.633 --> 25:42.734
AH, JESUS.

25:47.033 --> 25:50.900
( bell ringing )

25:51.834 --> 25:54.633
I'M STILL NOT SURE
THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM.

25:54.633 --> 25:57.166
ONCE THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD
REVIEWS NATHAN'S FINDINGS,

25:57.166 --> 25:59.533
THE TRUTH WILL
COME OUT ANYWAY.

25:59.533 --> 26:03.100
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL THE AUTOPSY'S DONE ?

26:03.100 --> 26:05.433
HE WHO CREATES
THE NEWS

26:05.433 --> 26:07.834
HAS THE BEST CHANCE
OF CONTROLLING IT.

26:07.834 --> 26:11.633
HERE'S TO
FULL DISCLOSURE.

26:17.567 --> 26:19.433
THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

26:19.433 --> 26:22.200
WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
TOXIC CHEMICAL ELEMENTS

26:22.200 --> 26:24.767

THROUGHOUT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

26:24.767 --> 26:27.867

( chattering )

26:36.433 --> 26:40.333
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MARTINEZ'S DEATH.

26:43.934 --> 26:45.834
GOOD MORNING,
MY BELOVEDS.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.233
GOT A NEWS FLASH
FOR YOU.

26:47.233 --> 26:50.500
YOUR PAL MARTINEZ
BOUGHT THE FARM.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.133
FARM ?

26:52.133 --> 26:53.734
WHAT FARM ?

26:53.734 --> 26:55.166
HE DIED, STUPID.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.934
WHAT'D HE DIE FROM ?

26:56.934 --> 26:58.800
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WHATEVER HE HAD,

26:58.800 --> 27:01.066
YOU CLUCKS
HAVE IT, TOO.

27:01.066 --> 27:02.233
ARE YOU SURE ?

27:02.233 --> 27:03.667
THAT'S THE SHUTTLEBUTT.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.066
SHIT.

27:05.066 --> 27:09.300
IF I WERE YOU, I'D PAY UP
MY INSURANCE PREMIUMS.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.734
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, LOOK.

27:10.734 --> 27:13.467
BUT BUYING A FARM IS
A GOOD THING, RIGHT ?

27:13.467 --> 27:16.233
I-I-I MEAN,
WHY THAT--

27:16.233 --> 27:17.967
TELL ME, WHY DOES
THAT HAVE TO MEAN DYING ?

27:17.967 --> 27:19.066
SHUT UP, OMAR.

27:19.066 --> 27:23.033
NO, LOOK, NOW THAT
DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.

27:23.033 --> 27:26.367
SOLD THE FARM, LOST THE FARM,
THE FARM BURNED DOWN, BUT...

27:26.367 --> 27:27.667
SHUT UP, OMAR !

27:27.667 --> 27:30.166
THAT DON'T MAKE
NO GODDAMN SENSE.

27:30.166 --> 27:31.300
HEY, SEAN.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.533
SEAN, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

27:32.533 --> 27:33.467
HERE I AM.

27:33.467 --> 27:35.033
WANT TO GET
A BEER AFTER WORK ?

27:35.033 --> 27:36.600
YEAH, AND I'M BUYING
TO CELEBRATE

27:36.600 --> 27:38.600
THE DEATH OF THAT
SPIC MARTINEZ.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.166
YEAH, I'M NOT
SHEDDING ANY TEARS,

27:40.166 --> 27:43.033
BUT IT'S TOO BAD HE 10-7'D
BEFORE HE RATTED ON MORALES.

27:43.033 --> 27:44.734
THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART,
PAL, HE DID.

27:44.734 --> 27:46.800
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN
VISITING MARTINEZ REGULAR,

27:46.800 --> 27:48.433
ALWAYS AT HIM
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

27:48.433 --> 27:51.000
WELL, HE MUST HAVE KNOWN
HE WAS GOING TO CROAK,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.333
AND HE WANTED TO MAKE HIS PEACE,
'CAUSE LAST NIGHT HE SPILLED.

27:53.333 --> 27:54.900
A DEATH BED
CONFESSION ?

27:54.900 --> 27:56.600
YEAH.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.767
MARTINEZ PINNED THE TAIL
ON MORALES' DONKEY ASS.

27:59.767 --> 28:01.333
YOU'VE KNOWN THIS
SINCE LAST NIGHT

28:01.333 --> 28:02.767
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING UNTIL NOW ?

28:02.767 --> 28:04.166
THAT'S WHY
I'M LOOKING FOR YA.

28:04.166 --> 28:07.200
I WANT MORALES
IN SOLITARY ASAP.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.333
ALRIGHT, COME ON.

28:24.867 --> 28:27.000
TAKE THE CUFFS OFF.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.900
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT ?

28:28.900 --> 28:30.367
WHAT IS THIS ?

28:30.367 --> 28:32.166
HALF-TIME
ENTERTAINMENT.

28:34.567 --> 28:37.700
YO, PENDERS, YOU THINK
MORALES IS GOING

28:37.700 --> 28:39.433
TO GET HIS FARM
FORECLOSED ?

28:39.433 --> 28:41.000
SHH, SHH, SHH.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.467
MARTINEZ CUT ME
RIGHT HERE,

28:44.467 --> 28:47.433
RUINED MY CHANCES OF
EVER PLAYING PRO BALL,

28:47.433 --> 28:49.400
AND I HAVE THIS LIMP.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.066
SO, YOU SEE, ENRIQUE,
IF I ONLY CUT THE ONE,

28:52.066 --> 28:54.600
YOU'LL LIMP
LIKE I DO.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.033
BUT IF I CUT THEM BOTH,

28:57.033 --> 28:59.834
YOU'LL WALK FINE.

29:02.467 --> 29:06.700
( screaming )

29:11.700 --> 29:14.300
( laughing )

29:16.000 --> 29:19.266
( screaming )

29:24.567 --> 29:26.900
( sobbing )

29:28.266 --> 29:30.200
I SEE THE DEVIL.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.100
I SEE THE DEVIL
EVERYWHERE.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.700
AND YOU SAY THIS
STARTED WHEN ?

29:33.700 --> 29:35.467
THE MOMENT KIRK DIED.

29:35.467 --> 29:38.600
IT WAS AS IF WHATEVER
POSSESSED HIM CAME INTO ME.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.667
I'M GOING TO ASK
SISTER PETER MARIE

29:41.667 --> 29:43.333
TO SCHEDULE A SESSION
WITH YOU, ALRIGHT ?

29:43.333 --> 29:44.600
I'M NOT CRAZY,
FATHER.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.333
I SEE THE DEVIL,

29:46.333 --> 29:49.967
RIGHT OVER
YOUR SHOULDER.

29:49.967 --> 29:52.600
( sobbing )

30:03.900 --> 30:07.333
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOING FOR AN
INSANITY DEFENSE IN HIS APPEAL.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.433
NO, HE KEEPS SAYING,
"I'M NOT CRAZY.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.967
I'M NOT CRAZY."

30:10.967 --> 30:12.934
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I THINK THAT HE'S CRAZY,

30:12.934 --> 30:14.433
BUT HE DOESN'T.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.400
I'M NOT SURE THAT
HE HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY,

30:16.400 --> 30:20.166
THEREFORE, I'M NOT SURE
THAT HE SHOULD BE EXECUTED.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.433
WOULD YOU
TALK TO HOYT ?

30:21.433 --> 30:22.767
CERTAINLY.

30:22.767 --> 30:24.033
BUT I HAVE TO ASK,

30:24.033 --> 30:25.934
WHAT ARE YOU HOPING
TO GET OUT OF THIS ?

30:25.934 --> 30:27.600
WHAT, ME PERSONALLY ?

30:27.600 --> 30:28.834
NOTHING.
YEAH.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.066
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:30.066 --> 30:33.467
ARE YOU TRYING TO ASSUAGE
YOUR GUILT BY HELPING HOYT ?

30:33.467 --> 30:37.266
YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF THAT YOU
PRAYED FOR TIMMY KIRK TO DIE.

30:37.266 --> 30:41.900
YES, BUT I KNOW THAT GOD DOESN'T
ANSWER THOSE KINDS OF PRAYERS,

30:41.900 --> 30:44.333
THAT HOYT ACTED
ON HIS OWN VOLITION

30:44.333 --> 30:46.567
AND THAT I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH KIRK'S DEMISE.

30:46.567 --> 30:49.300
AND YET DOWN DEEP YOU'RE
HAPPY THAT THE BOY IS DEAD.

30:49.300 --> 30:54.133
LIKE I SAID, YOU'RE TRYING
TO BURN OFF EXCESS GUILT

30:54.133 --> 30:57.166
BY MAKING HOYT
INTO A CAUSE.

30:57.166 --> 31:00.200
JUST BE SURE HE IS
THE PROPER RECIPIENT.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.066
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

31:02.066 --> 31:04.767
JAZ HOYT IS NOT
THE VICTIM HERE.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.266
( Kirk )
YOU CAN WALK AWAY,

31:15.266 --> 31:18.000
BUT I'M NOT LIKE
THE REVEREND CLOUTIER.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.800
I WON'T JUST
DISAPPEAR.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.433
MRS. KIRK ?

31:23.433 --> 31:24.767
YES.

31:24.767 --> 31:26.000
I'M FATHER MUKADA.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.667
I HAVE TIMOTHY'S
BELONGINGS.

31:27.667 --> 31:30.133
I JUST NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS FORM.

31:34.567 --> 31:36.767
DID YOU KNOW
MY SON ?

31:36.767 --> 31:39.300
AH, YES.

31:46.433 --> 31:49.934
SUCH A SWEET,
SWEET FACE.

31:49.934 --> 31:53.200
WHO KNEW THERE WAS
SO MUCH BAD INSIDE ?

31:53.200 --> 31:57.166
HE LEFT HIS OWN BABY
TO DIE IN A DUMPSTER,

31:57.166 --> 32:01.033
THEN HE CAME HERE.

32:03.033 --> 32:05.867
HE SAID SUCH
TERRIBLE THINGS,

32:05.867 --> 32:10.166
SHOCKING THINGS
ABOUT THE CHURCH,

32:10.166 --> 32:13.200
ABOUT JESUS.

32:15.066 --> 32:19.033
HE CALLED ME
SATAN'S WHORE.

32:22.500 --> 32:27.333
FATHER, WOULD YOU
HEAR MY CONFESSION ?

32:30.567 --> 32:34.033
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
HAVE TO CONFESS ?

32:35.667 --> 32:39.867
I STPED LOVING
MY SON THAT DAY.

32:39.867 --> 32:43.367
MY HEART WENT COLD,

32:43.367 --> 32:46.300
AND I STOPPED
LOVING HIM.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.400
I NEED GOD
TO FORGIVE ME FOR THAT.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.767
( sobbing )

32:51.767 --> 32:53.900
SHH.

33:03.467 --> 33:06.467
"MUSIC EXPRESSES THAT WHICH
CANNOT BE PUT INTO WORDS,

33:06.467 --> 33:09.133
AND THAT WHICH
CANNOT REMAIN SILENT."

33:09.133 --> 33:11.633
VICTOR HUGO.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.667
HELLO, CYRIL.

33:16.667 --> 33:20.133
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

33:20.133 --> 33:23.633
I'VE BEEN WONDERING...

33:23.633 --> 33:26.533
WAIT, SISTER, DON'T YOU
WANT TO SAY HELLO TO ME ?

33:26.533 --> 33:28.934
OH, YEAH, SURE,
HELLO, JERICHO.

33:28.934 --> 33:33.967
CYRIL, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING LATELY ?

33:33.967 --> 33:36.934
HE'S FINE.

33:38.367 --> 33:41.333
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

33:41.333 --> 33:44.734
LET'S PUT JERICHO
AWAY, OKAY ?

33:46.767 --> 33:48.567
NO.

33:48.567 --> 33:50.834
YES.

33:50.834 --> 33:53.800
GIVE ME THE PUPPET.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.767
FUCK YOU,

34:00.767 --> 34:03.867
YOU CUNT.

34:03.867 --> 34:08.033
CYRIL,
I GAVE YOU JERICHO,

34:08.033 --> 34:11.400
AND NOW
I WANT HIM BACK.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.400
OKAY, NOW LET GO.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.567
LET GO.

34:22.567 --> 34:24.133
OW, OW, OW, OW !

34:24.133 --> 34:26.533
OFFICER !

34:26.533 --> 34:28.433
I NEED HELP.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.700
LET HER GO !

34:29.700 --> 34:31.967
JERICHO
MADE ME DO IT !

34:32.467 --> 34:34.867
JERICHO MADE ME
DO IT !

34:34.867 --> 34:37.400
GET OFF ME !

34:37.400 --> 34:38.900
GIVE ME THAT THING !

34:38.900 --> 34:41.834
GET UP.

34:50.734 --> 34:52.400
JERICHO.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.166
JERICHO.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.433
JERICHO.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.033
JERICHO.

35:04.033 --> 35:05.767
JERICHO.

35:05.767 --> 35:07.533
O'REILY,
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

35:07.533 --> 35:09.667
JERICHO.

35:09.667 --> 35:12.000
SOBBING LIKE A CHICK
OVER A STUPID PUPPET ?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.066
JERICHO.

35:14.066 --> 35:16.300
KNOCK IT OFF RIGHT NOW,
OR ELSE.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.533
JERICHO, JERICHO.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.166
OKAY, I WARNED YOU.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.867
MATT !

35:21.867 --> 35:23.400
JERICHO.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.400
JERICHO.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.934
WHAT THE FUCK ?

35:26.934 --> 35:29.967
JERICHO.

35:29.967 --> 35:32.066
DOUSE THE
LITTLE PRICK.

35:35.700 --> 35:39.033
STOP, STOP !

35:43.867 --> 35:45.867
STOP !

35:45.867 --> 35:47.967
( sobbing )

35:47.967 --> 35:50.834
YOU WANT SOME
OF THIS, TOO ?

35:52.567 --> 35:54.166
STOP !

35:57.834 --> 35:59.433
LIGHTS OUT !

36:00.633 --> 36:03.433
( breathing heavily )

36:10.033 --> 36:11.600
IF THE APPEALS COURT
PLAYS BALL,

36:11.600 --> 36:14.100
CYRIL O'REILY
WILL DIE NEXT MONTH,

36:14.100 --> 36:15.633
THE FIRST PERSON EXECUTED

36:15.633 --> 36:17.967
UNDER THE STATE'S NEW DEFINITION
OF MENTALLY RETARDED.

36:17.967 --> 36:21.600
WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR A BACKLASH.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.300
YES, REIMONDO AND HER
HAPPY BAND OF DO-GOODERS

36:24.300 --> 36:26.533
HAVE BEEN STIRRING UP
THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC.

36:26.533 --> 36:28.834
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW DO WE FIGHT BACK ?

36:28.834 --> 36:30.633
THERE WOULDN'T BE ALL
THIS BREAST-FEEDING

36:30.633 --> 36:32.567
IF THE FOLKS THOUGHT
THE 'TARD WAS NORMAL.

36:32.567 --> 36:36.100
SO, WE HAVE
TO MAKE HIM NORMAL,

36:36.100 --> 36:38.967
OR APPEAR NORMAL.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.600
ACCORDING TO
SISTER PETER MARIE'S FILES,

36:41.600 --> 36:44.233
CYRIL HAS BEEN GIVEN
A SERIES OF STABILIZING DRUGS,

36:44.233 --> 36:46.066
NONE OF WHICH
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

36:46.066 --> 36:47.867
WHICH IS WHY
I PROPOSE USING ECT.

36:47.867 --> 36:49.867
WHAT'S ECT. ?

36:49.867 --> 36:53.567
BASICALLY THE P.C. WAY
OF SAYING ELECTROSHOCK.

36:53.567 --> 36:55.533
GOVERNOR--

36:55.533 --> 36:57.633
THERE'S A NASTY
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT ECT.

36:57.633 --> 37:01.567
IT'S NOT THE HORRIBLE MIND
TORTURE YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES.

37:01.567 --> 37:04.767
IT'S REALLY
QUITE BENIGN.

37:04.767 --> 37:07.000
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
DEBATING THE PROS AND CONS

37:07.000 --> 37:08.900
OF ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.066
CYRIL IS
SISTER PETER MARIE'S PATIENT.

37:11.066 --> 37:13.467
A DECISION CAN'T BE MADE
WITHOUT CONSULTING HER.

37:13.467 --> 37:16.367
DR. DONALD ROFE, DIRECTOR OF THE
STATE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH

37:16.367 --> 37:17.867
WILL MEET
WITH HER TOMORROW.

37:17.867 --> 37:21.233
YOU'LL ALSO NEED PERMISSION
FROM THE O'REILY FAMILY.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.233
SIGNED BY THE FATHER,
SHEAMUS O'REILY.

37:26.233 --> 37:28.800
YOU AGREE
WITH ALL THIS ?

37:28.800 --> 37:31.867
IT WAS MY IDEA.

37:44.133 --> 37:46.467
PETER MARIE,

37:46.467 --> 37:49.033
YOU OKAY ?

37:49.967 --> 37:53.133
AH, NO.

37:53.133 --> 37:57.166
I JUST HAD A MEETING
WITH DON ROFE

37:57.166 --> 38:01.734
WHO TOLD ME THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO GIVE CYRIL O'REILY ECT,

38:01.734 --> 38:03.333
AND...

38:03.333 --> 38:07.800
THAT I'D BETTER
SHUT UP AND LIKE IT.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.834
WILL YOU ?

38:09.834 --> 38:15.900
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE.

38:15.900 --> 38:18.834
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,

38:18.834 --> 38:22.533
I JUST RAISE HIGH
THE BATTLEMENTS AND CHARGE.

38:22.533 --> 38:29.033
BUT AS ROFE
SO ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT,

38:29.033 --> 38:32.600
IN CYRIL'S CASE...

38:35.033 --> 38:39.333
I HAVE FAILED
COMPLETELY.

38:41.934 --> 38:45.934
NOTHING I TRIED
HAS WORKED.

38:48.133 --> 38:51.600
SO, I HAVE TO WEIGH
MY EGO AGAINST

38:51.600 --> 38:53.734
WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY PATIENT.

38:53.734 --> 38:57.200
I DON'T WANT
TO SAY NO

38:57.200 --> 39:00.266
JUST TO KEEP SOMEBODY ELSE
FROM SUCCEEDING

39:00.266 --> 39:06.033
WHERE I HAVE FAILED.

39:06.033 --> 39:09.834
AND YOU THINK A SPIN AROUND
McMANUS' MAZE WILL DO THE TRICK.

39:09.834 --> 39:12.533
CAN'T HURT.

39:31.867 --> 39:33.200
HEY, YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME ?

39:33.200 --> 39:35.333
YEAH, RYAN, SIT DOWN.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.033
THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE
I WANTED TO SEE YOU, TOO.

39:37.033 --> 39:39.300
I JUST SAW CYRIL,
AND HE'S SO GODDAMN SAD.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.066
IF THIS PUPPET MEANS
SO MUCH TO HIM,

39:41.066 --> 39:42.667
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IT BACK TO HIM ?

39:42.667 --> 39:44.567
I-I CAN'T, RYAN.

39:44.567 --> 39:48.166
JERICHO WAS MY IDEA,
REMEMBER ?

39:48.166 --> 39:51.700
A WAY FOR CYRIL TO DEAL
WITH THE CONFUSION
SURROUNDING THE TRIAL,

39:51.700 --> 39:55.200
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PUPPET
HAS COME TO MEAN

39:55.200 --> 39:58.000
MORE THAN THAT TO HIM.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.600
IT'S BECOME A WHOLE
OTHER PERSONALITY.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.333
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

40:03.333 --> 40:05.367
I JUST WANT CYRIL
TO BE HAPPY.

40:05.367 --> 40:07.200
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

40:07.200 --> 40:11.066
CYRIL IS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE
DEPRESSION AND SCHIZOPHRENIA.

40:11.066 --> 40:14.367
ALRIGHT,
SO WHAT'S NEXT ?

40:14.367 --> 40:17.066
I MEAN, WHAT CAN
WE DO TO CURE HIM ?

40:17.066 --> 40:21.166
YOUR FATHER HAS ALREADY AGREED
TO ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.000
MY FATHER ?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.066
WHAT THE FUCK DOES
THAT OLD BASTARD

40:25.066 --> 40:26.600
HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING ?

40:26.600 --> 40:29.200
I KNOW, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE,
BUT IN THE EYES OF THE LAW,

40:29.200 --> 40:31.233
HE IS CYRIL'S
GUARDIAN.

40:31.233 --> 40:34.367
ALRIGHT, SO THIS
ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY,

40:34.367 --> 40:35.867
DOES IT DO
ANY GOOD ?

40:35.867 --> 40:37.967
I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
WITH IT.

40:37.967 --> 40:41.166
THE TREATMENT WAS IN VOGUE
FOR YEARS AND FELL OUT OF FAVOR.

40:41.166 --> 40:44.500
HOWEVER, SOME MENTAL HEALTH
PROFESSIONALS SWEAR BY IT.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.734
CLINICAL EVIDENCE
INDICATES THAT ECT

40:47.734 --> 40:51.100
PRODUCES A SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT

40:51.100 --> 40:53.100
IN 80% OF PATIENTS.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.567
ARE THERE
ANY DANGERS ?

40:54.567 --> 40:57.900
THERE'S HEADACHES,
THERE'S SORENESS,

40:57.900 --> 41:01.266
NAUSEA, MEMORY LOSS.

41:01.266 --> 41:05.333
LOOK, WE'RE TALKING
120 VOLTS,

41:05.333 --> 41:07.900
AN ORDINARY
HOUSEHOLD CURRENT

41:07.900 --> 41:10.166
APPLIED TO THE BRAIN
FOR HALF A SECOND

41:10.166 --> 41:13.934
10 TO 15 TIMES WITHIN A PERIOD
OF TWO TO THREE WEEKS,

41:13.934 --> 41:17.166
AND NO ONE KNOWS IF
THERE'S PERMANENT DAMAGE.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.934
NO.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.467
JESUS CHRIST,
CAN'T WE STOP THEM ?

41:21.467 --> 41:26.166
THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY HAVE
CONSPIRED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

41:26.166 --> 41:28.567
WE ARE TAKEN OUT OF
THIS DECISION MAKING.

41:28.567 --> 41:30.600
I SPOKE TO ZELMAN TO SEE
IF WE COULD GO TO COURT,

41:30.600 --> 41:33.100
IF WE COULD FIGHT IT,
AND HE SAYS WE WOULDN'T WIN.

41:33.100 --> 41:35.133
THAT'S GENIUS.

41:35.133 --> 41:37.767
DEVLIN WANTS
TO ELECTROSHOCK CYRIL

41:37.767 --> 41:41.500
TO MAKE HIM NORMAL ENOUGH
TO ELECTROCUTE HIM.

41:51.333 --> 41:54.133
( Augustus Hill )
"MUSIC IS THE BRANDY
OF THE DAMNED."

41:54.133 --> 41:57.133
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.367
HELLO, CYRIL.

41:59.367 --> 42:00.734
WHY DON'T YOU HOP
RIGHT UP HERE ?

42:00.734 --> 42:03.266
TRUST ME, THIS ONE'S
GOING TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

42:03.266 --> 42:05.266
THIS IS GOING TO PRICK
JUST A BIT.

42:05.266 --> 42:06.767
COME ON, WE'RE GOING
TO GIVE YOU TWO DIFFERENT DRUGS,

42:06.767 --> 42:09.533
ONE THAT PUTS YOU TO SLEEP AND
THE OTHER RELAXES YOUR MUSCLES.

42:09.533 --> 42:12.000
THAT'S GONNA
PRICK JUST A BIT.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.867
THESE ARE ELECTRODES,
AND ONCE YOU'RE ASLEEP,

42:14.867 --> 42:18.500
THEY'LL MEASURE THE CURRENT
THAT'S STIMULATING YOUR BRAIN.

42:18.500 --> 42:20.300
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO
A LITTLE PROCEDURE TODAY.

42:20.300 --> 42:21.900
NOW, THIS IS GOING
TO PRICK JUST A BIT...

42:21.900 --> 42:23.367
WHEN THE LIQUID IS GOING
THROUGH THOSE TUBES.

42:23.367 --> 42:27.200
( cello playing )

42:28.867 --> 42:33.033
RELAX,
PUT YOU TO SLEEP.

42:34.967 --> 42:36.433
DOES IT HURT ?

42:36.433 --> 42:38.200
NOT IF YOU'RE ASLEEP.

42:38.200 --> 42:41.000
HE'S OUT.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.266
( cello playing )

42:50.633 --> 42:51.800
READY ?

42:51.800 --> 42:53.200
FIRE AWAY.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.266
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ?

43:18.266 --> 43:21.600
I HAVE A TERRIBLE
HEADACHE.

43:23.567 --> 43:26.166
DID YOU TELL
YOUR DOCTORS ?

43:26.166 --> 43:27.500
WHO ?

43:27.500 --> 43:30.300
NEVER MIND.

43:32.300 --> 43:34.700
SOMETIMES IF
SOMEBODY HOLDS YOU,

43:34.700 --> 43:36.867
THE PAIN GOES AWAY.

43:36.867 --> 43:39.233
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD YOU ?

43:39.233 --> 43:42.467
OKAY.

43:49.967 --> 43:52.000
COME ON.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.700
HI.

44:43.700 --> 44:48.233
I JUST HAD A CALL
FROM ARNOLD ZELMAN.

44:48.233 --> 44:53.000
THEY'VE DENIED
CYRIL'S APPEAL.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.233
SHIT.

44:58.100 --> 45:00.066
OKAY.

45:00.066 --> 45:01.900
OKAY, NOW
WHAT DO WE DO ?

45:01.900 --> 45:05.967
WELL, ZELMAN WILL PROBABLY TRY
TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER APPROACH,

45:05.967 --> 45:07.400
ANOTHER APPEAL,

45:07.400 --> 45:08.934
BUT IN THE MEANTIME

45:08.934 --> 45:12.800
THE JUDGE HAS SET THE DATE
FOR CYRIL'S EXECUTION.

45:13.834 --> 45:15.700
WHAT ?

45:15.700 --> 45:17.834
WHEN ?

45:17.834 --> 45:20.633
THREE WEEKS
FROM THURSDAY.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.767
THAT'S NOT MUCH TIME.

45:24.767 --> 45:29.900
I FEEL DEEP DOWN
WE'LL STOP THE EXECUTION,

45:29.900 --> 45:33.300
BUT JUST IN CASE, RYAN,

45:33.300 --> 45:36.200
I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO ACCEPT THE FACT...

45:36.200 --> 45:38.033
NO.

45:38.033 --> 45:39.600
NO WAY.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.300
YOU KNOW, IF I EVEN
ENTERTAIN THE THOUGHT,

45:41.300 --> 45:43.700
IF I LET MYSELF
BELIEVE FOR A SECOND

45:43.700 --> 45:45.433
THAT MY BROTHER'S
GONNA DIE,

45:45.433 --> 45:48.300
THEN MY BROTHER'S
GONNA DIE.

45:48.300 --> 45:50.500
THIS WAS
FATHER MEEHAN'S.

45:50.500 --> 45:55.367
I DON'T KNOW,
I-I HAVE FAITH, SISTER.

45:55.367 --> 45:59.066
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A REALLY LONG TIME,

45:59.066 --> 46:01.166
I HAVE FAITH.

46:05.567 --> 46:09.500
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE
GAVE UP RUNNING THE CAFETERIA.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.100
WE GOT US
SOME NEW JOBS.

46:12.100 --> 46:15.000
MAN, KITCHEN BEST
DETAIL THERE IS.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.200
I GOT THE BELLY
TO PROVE IT.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.333
YEAH, WELL, I FOUND US
SOMETHING BETTER,

46:20.333 --> 46:22.533
SOMETHING THAT WILL GET US
OUT OF THE MUCK AND MIRE.

46:22.533 --> 46:24.200
MAN, WE AIN'T DOWN
IN NO SHIT.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.500
WRONG, KENANIAH.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.800
WE IN SO MUCH SHIT YOU CAN'T
EVEN SMELL IT NO MORE.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.633
SO, WHAT'S
YOUR BRAINSTORM ?

46:29.633 --> 46:31.633
GONNA BE
TELEMARKETERS.

46:31.633 --> 46:33.967
TELE WHO ?

46:33.967 --> 46:35.533
I'M SERIOUS.

46:35.533 --> 46:37.500
GONNA LEARN
YOU BOYS SOME SKILLS,

46:37.500 --> 46:39.767
SOMETHING THAT'LL
MAKE YOU MORE CASH

46:39.767 --> 46:41.800
THAN YOU'RE MAKING
OVER THERE IN THE KITCHEN.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.166
NOT MORE
THAN SLINGING.

46:43.166 --> 46:44.934
AIN'T GONNA BE
NO MORE SLINGING.

46:44.934 --> 46:46.133
ARE YOU CRAZY,
NIGGER ?

46:46.133 --> 46:47.633
YEAH, NO MOTHERFUCKIN'
WAY WE GOING--

46:47.633 --> 46:49.066
HOLD UP, HOLD UP,
HOLD UP.

46:49.066 --> 46:50.700
SO, WHAT'S
YOUR ANGLE, BURR ?

46:50.700 --> 46:52.333
THERE AIN'T NO ANGLE.

46:52.333 --> 46:54.600
THIS IS THE DAWN
OF A NEW DAY, GENTLEMEN.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.867
OUR CHARGE IS
TO RISE UP AND FACE IT.

46:57.867 --> 47:01.767
AND RISE UP WE SHALL.

47:10.133 --> 47:14.333
AND THIS IS THE NERVE CENTER
OF OUR OPERATION.

47:14.333 --> 47:16.767
IT'S VERY NICE,
VERY NICE.

47:16.767 --> 47:19.734
AND IT RUNS LIKE ANY OTHER
TELEMARKETING FIRM.

47:19.734 --> 47:21.200
BETTER.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.967
I HIRE THESE GUYS CHEAP,
YOU GET ME CHEAPER,

47:22.967 --> 47:25.066
WHICH IN TURN LOWERS
YOUR OVERHEAD,

47:25.066 --> 47:26.767
INCREASES CALL VOLUME

47:26.767 --> 47:28.600
AND FILLS THOSE
CAMPAIGN COFFERS.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.467
AND THE DAY-TO-DAY,
NO DIFFERENCE.

47:30.467 --> 47:31.867
S-O-P.

47:31.867 --> 47:33.967
YOU PROVIDE US WITH CONTACT
NUMBERS AND PREPARED TEXT,

47:33.967 --> 47:35.300
WE GET RIGHT TO WORK.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.200
AND NOBODY KNOWS
THEY'RE TALKING TO CONVICTS.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.133
NOT UNLESS YOU WANT US
TO TELL THEM.

47:39.133 --> 47:41.967
TRUST ME, THAT WOULD BE THE LAST
THING THAT SENATOR LAKEN

47:41.967 --> 47:44.066
WOULD WANT
HIS CONSTITUENTS TO KNOW.

47:44.066 --> 47:45.400
LAKEN ?

47:45.400 --> 47:47.767
THE RIGHT-WING,
BIBLE-TOTING MOTHERFUCKER ?

47:47.767 --> 47:50.767
HIS LEGISLATION
IS THE MAIN REASON

47:50.767 --> 47:53.333
WHY HALF THE MEN IN HERE
ARE DOING TWICE AS MUCH TIME.

47:53.333 --> 47:57.066
LET ME ASSURE YOU, MR. D'ARATA,
THAT MY COMPANY IS NON-PARTISAN

47:57.066 --> 47:59.066
AND WILL BE COMMITTED
TO WHATEVER IT IS

47:59.066 --> 48:00.400
YOU WANT US TO DO.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.033
CAN THE EDITORIALS.

48:02.033 --> 48:04.100
I'M SORRY, SIR.

48:04.100 --> 48:05.467
I DON'T MEAN
ANY OFFENSE.

48:05.467 --> 48:06.900
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

48:06.900 --> 48:10.400
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED
TO THEIR OWN POINT OF VIEW.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.734
THIS IS AMERICA,
AFTER ALL.

48:12.734 --> 48:16.033
AND THIS PROGRAM IS
WORKING IN OTHER PRISONS ?

48:16.033 --> 48:17.367
IT'S THRIVING.

48:17.367 --> 48:19.834
A SITUATION LIKE
THIS BENEFITS EVERYBODY.

48:19.834 --> 48:21.667
NOBODY LOSES.

48:21.667 --> 48:23.834
I'M A CAMPAIGN MANAGER,
MS. DEGENHART.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.367
SOMEBODY ALWAYS LOSES.

48:25.367 --> 48:28.934
BUT I WILL TAKE YOUR PROPOSAL
BACK TO MY PEOPLE.

48:39.266 --> 48:41.000
DON'T LET ME GO
REALA, GORILLA,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.166
BAD NIGGER, DRILLER.

48:43.166 --> 48:45.400
DOUBLE LIVE, CROSS-EYED,
SEE-YOU-FROM-THE-SIDE SCHEMER.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.100
TYPE OF NIGGER
BANG HIS CHEST WHEN HE FIGHT,

48:47.100 --> 48:49.000
FOR HE'S IN
TOO MUCH TRUTH,

48:49.000 --> 48:50.667
SO, WE SEE THE BLESSINGS
OF NIGHT, BLESSINGS OF CALM.

48:50.667 --> 48:52.266
NOTHING LAYS WAITING.

48:52.266 --> 48:53.767
IMAGINE WHAT HE'S HOLD
IN HIS PALM,

48:53.767 --> 48:55.266
HOLDING IN HIS DREAM,

48:55.266 --> 48:56.667
500 YEARS OF HATE
JUST BUILDING LIKE STEAM,

48:56.667 --> 48:58.367
MOUNTING LIKE KILIMANJARO.

48:58.367 --> 49:01.000
SO, JUST WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW
WHEN THINGS GET RIGHT WITH ME.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.100
I'M GONNA SMITE
THE WICKED, STEP OFF EASY.

49:03.100 --> 49:05.133
WHAT, WHAT ?

49:05.133 --> 49:08.433
BURR, BURR,
WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP ?

49:08.433 --> 49:10.433
WE'RE IN BUSINESS,
GENTLEMEN.

49:10.433 --> 49:13.533
CONTRACT GOT
SIGNED TODAY.

49:13.533 --> 49:16.700
NOW, WHY THAT PUT YOU
IN SUCH A FINE FUCKIN' MOOD.

49:16.700 --> 49:19.333
THEY AIN'T TURNING US
INTO WORKING STIFFS, MAN.

49:19.333 --> 49:22.633
POET, THAT ATTITUDE IS THE FIRST
THING YOU GONNA GET RID OF.

49:22.633 --> 49:24.400
I AIN'T DOIN' IT.

49:24.400 --> 49:27.467
FUNNY HOW YOU THINK
YOU GOT A CHOICE.

49:27.467 --> 49:30.533
SO, WE GIVING UP
THE TIT TRADE
JUST LIKE THAT ?

49:30.533 --> 49:33.066
IF I AM, YOU ARE, TOO.

49:33.066 --> 49:36.233
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT GETTING ON BOARD

49:36.233 --> 49:37.834
RIGHT AWAY, OKAY ?

49:37.834 --> 49:39.967
JUST BE READY BY
9:00 TOMORROW MORNING.

49:39.967 --> 49:42.400
C'MON BURR,
GODDAMN, MAN.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.900
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BELIEVE THAT I'M RIGHT,

49:44.900 --> 49:48.400
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO SHOW YOU HOW RIGHT I AM.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.767
WHATEVER MAN.

49:51.700 --> 49:56.433
SO, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO
PUBLISH AUGUSTUS HILL'S BOOK ?

49:56.433 --> 49:59.266
WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE IT
OUT THIS MONTH,

49:59.266 --> 50:01.100
BUT THAT'S WHY
WE NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

50:01.100 --> 50:04.300
THERE'S BEEN A BUMP
OVER WHO OWNS THE RIGHTS.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.233
AUGUSTUS HAD A WILL CLEARLY
STATING ALL MONEYS FROM THE BOOK

50:07.233 --> 50:09.600
WENT TO GROUPS
THAT HELP PRISONERS,

50:09.600 --> 50:10.934
LIKE THE FORTUNE SOCIETY.

50:10.934 --> 50:13.000
YES, BUT HIS WIFE,
ANABELLA...

50:13.000 --> 50:14.633
EX-WIFE,
SHE DIVORCED HIM.

50:14.633 --> 50:16.667
WELL, SHE IS CLAIMING THAT
THE DIVORCE WAS NOT FINAL

50:16.667 --> 50:18.533
AT THE TIME
OF HILL'S DEATH

50:18.533 --> 50:20.867
AND THAT SHE IS THE RIGHTFUL
HEIR TO HIS ROYALTIES.

50:20.867 --> 50:23.867
PLUS, WE'VE BEEN SERVED
AN INJUNCTION BY THE FAMILY

50:23.867 --> 50:25.367
OF LAWRENCE HUDACK.

50:25.367 --> 50:26.800
THE OFFICER THAT
AUGUSTUS KILLED ?

50:26.800 --> 50:28.300
THIS STATE HAS
A SON OF SAM LAW.

50:28.300 --> 50:29.567
ALL OF THE MONEY
FROM THE BOOK

50:29.567 --> 50:31.533
IS SUPPOSED TO GO
INTO A VICTIM'S TRUST.

50:33.333 --> 50:36.333
KAREEM, WE ARE
LOOKING AT MONTHS,

50:36.333 --> 50:39.567
MAYBE YEARS
OF LEGAL BATTLES.

50:39.567 --> 50:43.233
WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING TO ME ?

50:43.233 --> 50:45.867
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
PUBLISH THIS BOOK ?

50:45.867 --> 50:48.200
THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S
SHAKY RIGHT NOW,

50:48.200 --> 50:52.233
AND THIS MEMOIR,
ALTHOUGH WELL WRITTEN,

50:52.233 --> 50:55.033
IT'S NOT A BEST SELLER.

50:55.033 --> 51:00.467
WHAT IF I COULD MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE,

51:00.467 --> 51:03.633
CUT YOUR
PRINTING COSTS ?

51:03.633 --> 51:06.600
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT ?

51:09.433 --> 51:11.533
I HAD AN INSPIRATION.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.166
NOW, JUST WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE, BACK UP.

51:15.166 --> 51:17.867
YOU WANT TO START
YOUR OWN COMPANY ?

51:17.867 --> 51:20.266
YES, BOOK BINDING.

51:20.266 --> 51:22.166
I'VE DONE
THE RESEARCH.

51:22.166 --> 51:24.233
PERFECT SIZE BUSINESS
TO RUN FROM OZ.

51:24.233 --> 51:26.367
I PRESUME YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
TO THE STATE FOR THE MONEY

51:26.367 --> 51:28.066
TO START
THIS LITTLE VENTURE.

51:28.066 --> 51:30.000
NO, WE MUSLIMS WILL
POOL OUR BANK ACCOUNTS.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.533
IT'S A SMALL RISK.

51:31.533 --> 51:34.133
MY PUBLISHERS HAVE AGREED
TO LET ME PRODUCE

51:34.133 --> 51:35.800
AUGUSTUS' BOOK
FOR THEM.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.433
THEY'VE INTRODUCED ME
TO SEVERAL POTENTIAL CLIENTS.

51:37.433 --> 51:40.300
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AGAINST THE
WHOLE CONCEPT OF PRISON LABOR.

51:40.300 --> 51:43.200
NOT THE CONCEPT,
THE WAY IT'S PRACTICED.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.934
I'M NOT GONNA DRIVE SOME LOCAL
COMPETITOR OUT OF BUSINESS

51:45.934 --> 51:48.600
IN THAT I DO NOT HAVE
ANY LOCAL COMPETITORS.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.667
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
McMANUS,

51:50.667 --> 51:52.700
I WILL PAY
THE DECENT WAGE,

51:52.700 --> 51:55.266
MINIMUM WAGE.

51:55.266 --> 51:58.000
SO, YOU'RE GOING
TO FORK OVER $5.25 AN HOUR

51:58.000 --> 51:59.767
OUT OF YOUR
OWN POCKET.

51:59.767 --> 52:01.900
IN THE BEGINNING, YES,
BUT WITH PROJECTED EARNINGS

52:01.900 --> 52:05.133
I EXPECT WE'LL BE MAKING IT
BACK WITHIN SIX WEEKS.

52:05.133 --> 52:09.233
WELL, I CAN'T THINK OF
A GOOD REASON TO SAY NO.

52:09.233 --> 52:10.700
YOU ?

52:10.700 --> 52:14.166
YOU KNOW, WE KEEP
DEVELOPING OUR OWN INDUSTRIES,

52:14.166 --> 52:18.734
OZ IS GONNA END UP ON
THE COVER OF "FORTUNE 500".

52:20.700 --> 52:23.767
LOOK AT THIS,
MY BROTHERS.

52:25.333 --> 52:28.467
IT'S AN ORDINARY BOOK
TO SOME,

52:30.166 --> 52:34.300
AND YET I BELIEVE WHAT
I HOLD IN MY HAND IS THE PAST,

52:34.300 --> 52:38.033
WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN;

52:38.033 --> 52:41.166
THE PRESENT,

52:41.166 --> 52:43.633
WHAT CAN BE READ NOW,

52:43.633 --> 52:45.734
AND THE FUTURE,

52:45.734 --> 52:49.300
THE GLORIOUS WORK
BEFORE US.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.400
AND WE MUSLIMS,

52:51.400 --> 52:52.934
WE'RE GOING
TO LEAD THE WAY

52:52.934 --> 52:56.066
FOR THE WORLD TO SEE HOW
WORKERS CAN BE TREATED FAIRLY,

52:56.066 --> 52:58.166
CAN BE TREATED
RESPECTFULLY.

52:58.166 --> 53:01.667
WE WILL DEMONSTRATE
TRUE PRIDE IN OUR CRAFT,

53:01.667 --> 53:04.934
AND WE WILL DEMONSTRATE,
ONCE AND FOREVER,

53:04.934 --> 53:08.533
HOW HUMAN BEINGS PULLING
TOGETHER CAN BECOME A FORCE

53:08.533 --> 53:13.400
FOR GOOD AND CELEBRATE IT
IN THE SPIRIT OF ALLAH.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.900
( bell ringing )

53:15.900 --> 53:18.066
NOW, I'M ASKING
FOR YOUR HELP.

53:18.066 --> 53:21.000
I'M ASKING
FOR YOUR DEDICATION.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.734
I AM ASKING FOR
YOUR ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT.

53:25.734 --> 53:28.500
ARE YOU WITH ME ?

53:28.500 --> 53:29.600
( all )
YES.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.934
I CAN'T HEAR YOU,
ARE YOU WITH ME ?

53:30.934 --> 53:32.200
YES !

53:32.200 --> 53:33.500
ALLAH OU AKBAH.

53:33.500 --> 53:34.734
ALLAH OU AKBAH !

53:34.734 --> 53:35.734
ALLAH OU AKBAH !

53:35.734 --> 53:39.800
ALLAH OU AKBAH...

53:39.800 --> 53:43.200
ALL PRAISE
IS DUE TO ALLAH.

53:43.200 --> 53:46.266
OF COURSE YOU'VE SAID
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT, MINISTER.

53:46.266 --> 53:48.200
YES, BUT WORTH
THE STRUGGLE.

53:48.200 --> 53:50.433
BEING A PART OF PUBLISHING
AUGUSTUS' BOOK,

53:50.433 --> 53:53.500
THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF OZ
WILL BE REJUVENATED.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.834
NOW, I'VE CONTACTED
ANABELLA HILL

53:55.834 --> 53:58.400
AND THE HUDACK FAMILY.

53:58.400 --> 54:01.333
I'M TRYING TO SETTLE
THEIR LEGAL CLAIMS.

54:01.333 --> 54:03.433
WHO'S THAT ?

54:03.433 --> 54:05.400
HE'S A REPORTER.

54:05.400 --> 54:07.166
HE'S GONNA DO A STORY
ON OUR NEW VENTURE.

54:07.166 --> 54:08.967
WAIT HERE.

54:08.967 --> 54:10.333
ALRIGHT.

54:12.333 --> 54:16.000
KAREEM SAID.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.967
MR. IDZIK.

54:22.233 --> 54:26.000
( shouting )

54:40.567 --> 54:42.300
ARIF,

54:42.300 --> 54:46.233
DON'T HARM HIM.

54:48.700 --> 54:50.600
IT'S OKAY.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.467
YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALRIGHT.

54:52.467 --> 54:54.100
YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALRIGHT, MAN.

54:54.100 --> 54:55.967
COME ON, COME ON.

54:55.967 --> 54:58.934
BREATHE, BREATHE.

54:58.934 --> 55:02.834
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE...

55:08.567 --> 55:10.066
( Augustus Hill )
WILLIAM CONGREVE SAID,

55:10.066 --> 55:12.834
"MUSIC HAS CHARMS
TO SOOTHE A SAVAGE BREAST,

55:12.834 --> 55:15.900
TO SOFTEN ROCKS
OR BEND A KNOTTED OAK."

55:15.900 --> 55:18.533
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE MUSIC IS GONE,

55:18.533 --> 55:21.233
WHEN THERE
IS NO MELODY,

55:21.233 --> 55:25.967
WHEN ALL YOU HEAR
IS SILENCE ?

55:27.133 --> 55:29.900
THE BITTERSWEET,
DEAFENING SOUND OF NOTHING,

55:29.900 --> 55:33.433
NOTHING AT ALL.
