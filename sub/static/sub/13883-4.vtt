01:07.147 --> 01:10.708
<i>Three million years from Earth,</i>
<i>the mining ship Red Dwarf.</i>

01:10.851 --> 01:14.446
<i>Its crew: Dave Lister,</i>
<i>the last human alive, :</i>

01:14.588 --> 01:17.819
<i>Arnold Rimmer,</i>
<i>a hologram of his dead bunkmate, :</i>

01:17.958 --> 01:21.257
<i>And a creature who evolved</i>
<i>from the ship's cat. Message ends.</i>

01:23.730 --> 01:25.698
<i>Additional: On our journey back to Earth,</i>

01:25.832 --> 01:28.460
<i>we have encountered many bizarre things.</i>

01:28.602 --> 01:33.699
<i>Only last month, we came across a moon</i>
<i>shaped like Felicity Kendal's bottom.</i>

01:36.243 --> 01:39.474
<i>We flew around that one a couple of times.</i>

01:44.584 --> 01:48.611
OK.
Rimmer, make this quick.

01:48.755 --> 01:52.691
Sir, I wish to place on record that Lister, David...

01:52.826 --> 01:56.489
- Quicker.
...smuggled aboard a consignment

01:56.630 --> 01:59.531
of the hallucinogenic fungi Titan mushrooms,

01:59.666 --> 02:04.797
more popularly known to the space
beatnik community as "freaky fungus".

02:04.938 --> 02:07.236
- Is this true?
- Sort of.

02:07.374 --> 02:13.472
...and on February 26th at 0800,
engaged in conversation with Rimmer, Arnold.

02:13.613 --> 02:15.342
For crying out loud, Rimmer!

02:15.482 --> 02:20.784
The outcome was a proposal to cook
the aforementioned Rimmer breakfast.

02:20.921 --> 02:25.858
- OK, I'm getting the picture.
...comprising of two eggs, bacon,

02:25.992 --> 02:31.453
two sausages, fried potatoes
and a large quantity of mushrooms.

02:31.598 --> 02:35.432
Having consumed this repast,
Rimmer, Arnold J, experienced

02:35.569 --> 02:39.505
what can only be described
as a voyage to trip-out city.

02:40.474 --> 02:43.341
To whit, a major hallucinogenic fit.

02:43.944 --> 02:46.469
- Lister, is this true?
- No, sir.

02:46.613 --> 02:48.945
It was only one egg.

02:49.850 --> 02:54.116
The aforementioned Rimmer, to whit, me,
then attended inspection parade.

02:54.254 --> 02:57.553
He was totally naked,
except for leather driving gloves

02:57.691 --> 03:00.125
and blue swimming goggles.

03:00.260 --> 03:04.526
Under the influence of this psychedelic
breakfast, he attacked two officers,

03:04.664 --> 03:07.861
believing them to be giraffes
and armed and dangerous.

03:08.268 --> 03:11.863
- You'd better have a good reason.
- I have, sir.

03:12.005 --> 03:15.771
- Why?
- I thought it'd be a laugh.

03:16.309 --> 03:18.869
Right. Two weeks PD, Lister. Dismissed.

03:19.012 --> 03:23.278
With respect, sir, the penalty
for such a crime is 15 years' imprisonment.

03:23.416 --> 03:26.010
- Thanks!
- I said dismissed.

03:26.152 --> 03:28.177
- Two weeks?!
- That's enough.

03:28.321 --> 03:32.917
- Two smegging weeks?!
- I said that's enough!

03:34.227 --> 03:38.323
With respect, sir,
you've got your head up your fat ass.

03:39.366 --> 03:42.494
Eight weeks PD! How come
I get eight weeks and you get only two?

03:42.636 --> 03:45.298
What did I do to deserve that?

03:46.540 --> 03:51.568
- You stuck your pencil up his nose.
- Only the rubber end.

03:51.711 --> 03:54.009
You ate his wife's photograph.

03:54.147 --> 03:57.378
I thought it was a still
from Planet Of The Apes.

03:57.517 --> 04:01.044
- Two teas.
- (MAN) Excuse me.

04:01.888 --> 04:04.584
Listen, man,
I'm sorry about those mushrooms.

04:04.724 --> 04:07.557
I didn't know.
I'm not totally irresponsible.

04:07.694 --> 04:11.221
I'm a pretty straight and honest geezer.

04:11.364 --> 04:16.700
- Where'd you get them?
- I nicked them from Headbanger Harris.

04:19.272 --> 04:22.571
- Why didn't you tell the Captain?
- And get someone into trouble?

04:22.709 --> 04:25.405
Eight weeks painting the smegging ship?

04:25.545 --> 04:28.537
- I'm sorry.
- Get the spacesuits.

04:29.716 --> 04:33.413
(RIMMER'S VOICE) Don't panic, Arnold.
Stay absolutely calm.

04:33.553 --> 04:39.685
I'm coming out, so stay cool.
Are you ready? Here I come.

04:41.795 --> 04:46.596
There. That wasn't too bad, was it?
We found a stasis leak on floor 16.

04:46.733 --> 04:53.536
I'm dead. You're not, but if I save you,
you won't die, so neither will I.

05:09.089 --> 05:11.523
- Good book?
- It's all right.

05:11.658 --> 05:14.957
- I didn't think you read.
- Not much, but this is good.

05:15.095 --> 05:16.892
- What is it?
- Your diary.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.725
What?!

05:18.865 --> 05:22.301
You sent secret love letters to Carol McCauley?

05:22.435 --> 05:24.960
Lister, that is my private, personal, private diary,

05:25.105 --> 05:28.006
full of personal, private, personal things.

05:28.141 --> 05:30.200
It's gone public.

05:31.144 --> 05:35.444
- You've been reading it to the Cat?
- Only the best bits!

05:35.582 --> 05:40.246
"Carol McCauley, your eyes are like
two limpid pools of loveliness."

05:40.387 --> 05:43.447
- Shut up.
- "Your hair, a golden waterfall."

05:43.590 --> 05:46.923
- Shut up.
- "Your short skirts make me horny."

05:48.395 --> 05:50.659
I order you to shut your face.

05:50.797 --> 05:54.164
- You can read my diary.
- Who'd want to?

05:54.300 --> 05:57.565
It's full of puerile nonsense
about Kristine Kochanski.

05:57.704 --> 06:00.400
Ah, so you've read my diary?

06:00.540 --> 06:05.170
Yes, but at least I have the common
decency to do it behind your back.

06:05.311 --> 06:08.041
That IS the decent thing to do.

06:08.181 --> 06:13.175
I'm doing it for a reason.
Look what I found in Kochanski's quarters.

06:14.254 --> 06:15.881
- So?
- Look at it!

06:16.022 --> 06:21.585
- It's a wedding photograph.
- And who's the gorgeous hunk she's marrying?

06:21.728 --> 06:23.662
It's you! You didn't marry Kochanski!

06:23.797 --> 06:28.700
Exactly! So, how is this possible,
unless somehow we go back in time?

06:29.636 --> 06:33.265
- What's this got to do with my diary?
- It's this bit about the mushrooms.

06:33.406 --> 06:37.467
When you saw your head,
it wasn't an hallucination.

06:37.610 --> 06:41.376
I think you were seeing you now in the past.

06:41.514 --> 06:46.975
There's a wise old Cat saying,
which I think applies in this situation.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.611
"What are you talking about, dog-breath?"

06:50.323 --> 06:53.884
Listen. "The head came
through the table and said,

06:54.027 --> 06:58.964
"'I'm from the future.
We found a stasis leak on floor 16."'

06:59.099 --> 07:03.536
- It wasn't an hallucination.
- What's a stasis leak?

07:03.670 --> 07:06.730
<i>All right, dudes.</i>
<i>What's going down in groove town?</i>

07:06.873 --> 07:09.137
Hol, what's a stasis leak?

07:09.275 --> 07:14.178
<i>Ooh, well, very, very basically,</i>
<i>putting it simply in layman's terms,</i>

07:14.314 --> 07:17.511
<i>a stasis leak is a leak, right? In stasis.</i>

07:17.650 --> 07:20.244
<i>Hence the name "stasis leak".</i>

07:20.386 --> 07:23.549
- You don't know, do you?
<i>- No.</i>

07:23.690 --> 07:27.126
Let's go down to floor 16
and see what's there.

07:27.260 --> 07:31.754
How come he never knows anything
with an IQ of 6,000?

07:31.898 --> 07:37.734
<i>6,000's not much. It's the same</i>
<i>as 12,000 car park attendants.</i>

07:38.471 --> 07:39.870
But you don't know anything.

07:40.006 --> 07:44.340
<i>I'm one of the most sophisticated</i>
<i>computers ever devised by man.</i>

07:44.477 --> 07:48.140
<i>- I'm next to infullible.</i>
- Infallible.

07:48.281 --> 07:49.543
<i>Exactly.</i>

07:59.425 --> 08:02.724
(LISTER) Floor 16.
(RIMMER) This'll take ages.

08:02.862 --> 08:05.626
<i>Welcome to Xpress Lifts' descent to floor 16.</i>

08:05.765 --> 08:09.701
<i>We'll be going down 2,567 floors,</i>

08:09.836 --> 08:15.797
<i>and, for a small charge, you can enjoy</i>
<i>the in-lift movie, Gone With The Wind.</i>

08:15.942 --> 08:21.175
<i>If you look right and left,</i>
<i>you will notice there are no exits.</i>

08:21.314 --> 08:26.718
<i>In the highly unlikely event</i>
<i>of the lift crashing, death is certain.</i>

08:27.720 --> 08:31.281
<i>Under your seat, you have a cassette</i>
<i>for recording your last will,</i>

08:31.424 --> 08:36.361
<i>and from above your head a bag will drop</i>
<i>containing cyanide capsules.</i>

08:36.496 --> 08:38.726
This stuff freaks me out.

08:38.865 --> 08:42.494
<i>To take the cyanide capsule,</i>
<i>simply break open, like so,</i>

08:42.635 --> 08:45.570
<i>and place under the tongue.</i>

08:46.172 --> 08:47.434
(THUD)

08:52.412 --> 08:56.872
<i>Thank you for traveling Xpress</i>
<i>Lifts. We apologize for the delay.</i>

08:57.016 --> 08:59.644
You should apologize for the chicken!

08:59.786 --> 09:02.755
First meal I've had where the container
tasted better than the food!

09:05.491 --> 09:07.482
(HUMMING)

09:12.398 --> 09:15.060
This must be the stasis leak.

09:18.838 --> 09:21.068
OK. Here we go.

09:33.953 --> 09:36.615
It's safe. Come through.

09:46.499 --> 09:47.830
What IS it?

09:47.967 --> 09:51.232
It's a rent in the space-time
continuum.

09:51.371 --> 09:56.035
- What IS it?
- The stasis room freezes time.

09:56.175 --> 10:00.703
So if it leaks, it must preserve
what it's leaked into, like this room.

10:00.847 --> 10:04.840
- What IS it?
- It's a point in the universe

10:04.984 --> 10:08.420
where laws of space and time don't apply.

10:08.554 --> 10:11.648
- What IS it?
- It's a hole into the past.

10:11.791 --> 10:14.919
A magic door! Why didn't you say?

10:15.061 --> 10:20.624
It's March 2nd. That's three weeks
before the crew got wiped out.

10:22.936 --> 10:24.870
(ALL) Hi.

10:26.572 --> 10:31.635
Do you mind? This is the annual general
meeting of the Agoraphobic Society!

10:33.046 --> 10:36.038
I wonder, can we bring anybody back?

10:44.757 --> 10:47.351
Not unless we want them turned into powder.

10:47.493 --> 10:50.519
- Who were you thinking of?
- Me.

10:50.663 --> 10:52.654
Let's do it!

11:14.787 --> 11:18.746
What's the point in going,
if you can't bring anybody back?

11:18.891 --> 11:24.796
- You've seen the photo. I marry her.
- But in three weeks, she'll be dust.

11:24.931 --> 11:30.665
- You might as well marry a box of Daz.
- I'm staying with her.

11:31.304 --> 11:35.764
Staying with her? For the sake of three weeks,
you're giving up your life?

11:35.908 --> 11:39.435
- Yeah.
- I don't believe it.

11:39.579 --> 11:42.309
- Mr Selfish or what?
- Eh?

11:42.448 --> 11:47.283
What about me? I've given you
the best years of my death!

11:47.420 --> 11:50.753
Is that it, then? Three years.
"Thanks, pal. I'm off"!

11:50.890 --> 11:54.348
No regrets? Not so much
as a lump in your throat?

11:54.494 --> 11:59.557
No, it's Kochanski. The only lump
you've got is down your trousers.

11:59.699 --> 12:02.691
I'm going for it, Rimmer.

12:02.835 --> 12:06.396
You don't get many shots at happiness,
so go for them all.

12:06.539 --> 12:10.407
I'm sharing a bunk
with a Barbara Cartland character.

12:11.711 --> 12:15.340
- What would you do?
- I don't know, I... Do what you like.

12:15.481 --> 12:20.145
- Rimmer, you don't even like me.
- Don't I? Fine.

12:20.286 --> 12:23.517
- You don't, though.
- That's what you think?

12:24.190 --> 12:26.920
I will tell you something that'll stun you.

12:27.060 --> 12:29.756
- What?
- You're right. I don't like you.

12:29.896 --> 12:34.799
I don't like what you stand for,
but for some weird reason...

12:34.934 --> 12:39.701
I don't know. What's the point?
Everything always goes wrong for me.

12:39.839 --> 12:45.903
I'm the only person in the world to buy
a Topic bar without one hazelnut in it.

12:46.846 --> 12:51.943
It happens, you know, Rimmer.
You meet people, then you move on.

12:52.085 --> 12:54.610
When I was ten, I had a friend called Duncan.

12:54.754 --> 12:57.780
My best mate. Taught me everything,

12:57.924 --> 13:02.293
like how to put mirrors
on me toecaps to look up girls' skirts.

13:02.428 --> 13:05.124
His dad had to move to Spain because of a job...

13:05.264 --> 13:10.896
a bank job he pulled in Purley.
Never saw him again.

13:11.037 --> 13:14.905
I think of him every time I look at me shoes.

13:15.708 --> 13:19.735
Don't try and explain it, Lister.
I don't know why I'm even surprised.

13:19.879 --> 13:22.575
Everyone always leaves me in the end.

13:22.715 --> 13:25.183
Girls, parents...

13:25.318 --> 13:27.980
I had a pet lemming once.

13:29.856 --> 13:32.086
I loved that little lemming.

13:32.225 --> 13:36.218
I built him a little wall,
so he could hurl himself off it.

13:37.296 --> 13:39.287
He didn't want for anything.

13:39.432 --> 13:43.835
One Christmas, I put my finger
in his cage with some mince pie.

13:43.970 --> 13:49.602
He bit me! He sunk his teeth
into my fingers and wouldn't let go.

13:49.742 --> 13:54.202
In the end, I had to smash
his brains out against the wall.

13:54.347 --> 13:57.316
That little lemming broke my heart.

13:57.450 --> 14:01.716
The little git completely ruined
my helicopter wallpaper.

14:04.157 --> 14:07.593
Maybe there is a way to bring people
back from the past.

14:07.727 --> 14:11.629
- Oh, how?
- Well, there's a spare stasis booth.

14:11.764 --> 14:16.599
We could bring one person back
if they went into suspended animation.

14:17.236 --> 14:19.568
- They'd survive the accident.
- Yeah.

14:19.705 --> 14:22.970
Then we could bring them out, and bingo!

14:23.109 --> 14:26.545
Brilliant! I could save my own life!

14:26.679 --> 14:30.638
- I could bring her back.
- I could bring me back.

14:30.783 --> 14:36.517
There'd be a dead me and a living me,
one for the week and one for Sunday best.

14:38.925 --> 14:41.223
Hey! There's only room for one -
Krissie!

14:41.360 --> 14:43.089
Rimmsie!

15:03.616 --> 15:07.416
Aow! Don't look, baby. It'll drive you crazy!

15:08.588 --> 15:10.715
What do you think?
You said look inconspicuous.

15:10.856 --> 15:14.986
Put this on.
You'll stand out a mile like that.

15:15.127 --> 15:20.963
- I wouldn't use this on my shoes.
- You look like you're on Come Jiving.

15:21.667 --> 15:25.159
- I'll look like an ordinary person!
- That's the point.

15:25.304 --> 15:28.569
People won't say,
"Who's he? He's gorgeous!"

15:28.708 --> 15:30.539
- Put it on.
- Oh...

15:30.676 --> 15:36.114
Well, maybe if I widen the lapels,
put in some vents...

15:36.249 --> 15:39.377
- Put it on!
- Where's Alphabet-Head?

15:39.518 --> 15:42.510
Rimmer? He sneaked off last night.

15:42.655 --> 15:47.058
He's already back in the past,
trying to save his own worthless hide.

15:48.060 --> 15:49.960
You reading me, Hol?

15:50.096 --> 15:53.998
<i>- I can see right down your gob.</i>
- Let's go.

15:54.133 --> 15:58.263
<i>I don't like being a watch,</i>
<i>dangling upside down.</i>

15:58.404 --> 16:01.134
<i>And warn me</i>
<i>before you put your hand in your pocket.</i>

16:01.274 --> 16:05.233
<i>Gave me a fright,</i>
<i>that sweet covered in fluff.</i>

16:07.179 --> 16:10.671
- Cheers, Hol.
<i>- Here we go again.</i>

16:10.816 --> 16:12.613
Put that on!

16:15.988 --> 16:17.250
(BOTH SINGING)

16:19.525 --> 16:24.087
Shh! Here it is, man. Just stick with me, OK?

16:31.170 --> 16:34.628
Um... Did you order a kiss-o-gram?

16:43.382 --> 16:47.182
Excuse me, did a short human
with pigtails come through here?

16:47.320 --> 16:49.311
(LISTER) Yo, Cat!

16:51.090 --> 16:54.116
Don't worry. It's personality that counts.

16:57.830 --> 17:01.027
Felicitations, beautiful ladies.

17:01.167 --> 17:04.136
Back from planet leave?
Let me take those cases.

17:04.270 --> 17:08.172
My name is Olaf Petersen. I am good in bed.

17:11.544 --> 17:16.607
It's always an honor to carry
the luggages of such beautiful ladies.

17:17.215 --> 17:19.480
- Petersen!
- Oh, hi.

17:19.617 --> 17:23.748
Petersen! How are you?
I don't believe it! It's you!

17:23.888 --> 17:27.825
I've missed you.
Give us a kiss, you smegger.

17:30.529 --> 17:32.724
He's just a friend!

17:32.865 --> 17:38.167
- I don't believe it!
- He hasn't seen me since breakfast!

17:38.304 --> 17:40.568
- I'll see you later!
- Sure.

17:40.706 --> 17:45.200
- I'll come to your room!
- Lister, you're dead!

17:50.783 --> 17:55.686
That was Petersen, an old mate of mine.
We were like that.

17:55.821 --> 17:59.120
Just think, I'm gonna be able
to see everybody again.

17:59.258 --> 18:03.888
<i>Give us a break.</i>
<i>It's like a tropical rainforest.</i>

18:04.029 --> 18:07.123
- Sorry, Hol.
- Wow!

18:07.266 --> 18:11.726
I've never been this close to women before!

18:11.871 --> 18:16.706
I don't know what it is,
but I want to do it a lot!

18:17.943 --> 18:19.968
(LISTER) I wonder what Rimmer's doing.

18:20.112 --> 18:23.411
(RIMMER)... I thought it was a still
from Planet Of The Apes.

18:23.549 --> 18:27.713
- (LISTER) Two teas.
- Excuse me.

18:27.853 --> 18:30.583
(LISTER) Listen, man,
I'm sorry about those mushrooms.

18:30.723 --> 18:33.624
I didn't know. I'm not totally irresponsible.

18:42.635 --> 18:45.900
- Why didn't you tell the Captain?
- And get someone into trouble?

18:46.038 --> 18:48.734
Eight weeks painting the smegging ship?

18:48.874 --> 18:51.866
- I'm sorry.
- Get the spacesuits.

18:53.312 --> 18:56.770
(RIMMER'S VOICE) Don't panic, Arnold.
Stay absolutely calm.

18:56.916 --> 19:01.717
I'm coming out, so stay cool.
Are you ready? Here I come.

19:04.857 --> 19:07.587
We found a stasis leak on floor 16.

19:07.726 --> 19:14.461
I'm dead. You're not, but if I save you,
you won't die, so neither will I.

19:16.769 --> 19:20.569
- I know what you are.
- You do?

19:20.706 --> 19:23.675
- You're a mushroom, aren't you?
- A what?

19:23.809 --> 19:28.837
- An hallucination. Go away.
- No, I'm you from the future.

19:28.981 --> 19:33.281
- In three million years, you're dead.
- Am I really?

19:33.419 --> 19:38.379
- Yes, unless you do something now.
- What do you suggest? More roughage?

19:38.524 --> 19:41.687
You're not listening!
You must go into stasis.

19:41.827 --> 19:45.490
- Go away!
- I'll be back soon.

19:47.733 --> 19:50.429
Stay calm. It's gone now.

19:58.277 --> 20:00.074
Rimmer.

20:07.353 --> 20:09.844
Now you've turned into a chicken!

20:10.689 --> 20:15.183
I just want to apologize.
We both got a little carried away.

20:15.327 --> 20:19.559
- I've been under a lot of pressure.
- Go away.

20:19.698 --> 20:23.862
I shouldn't have given you PD.
I just got a little riled.

20:24.003 --> 20:27.632
Did you indeed? How sad, Captain Paxo.

20:28.707 --> 20:33.269
What? Oh, oh, this.
No, I... This is for the party tonight.

20:33.412 --> 20:35.607
Half man, half chicken...

20:35.748 --> 20:38.876
You don't scare me. I know what you are.

20:39.018 --> 20:40.576
(CLUCKS)

20:40.719 --> 20:41.981
OWRGHHH!

20:43.389 --> 20:46.119
Now cluck off before I extract your giblets

20:46.258 --> 20:50.388
and shove an onion
between the lips you never kiss with.

20:50.529 --> 20:56.161
Forget everything I've just said!
You have got eight months PD!

20:56.302 --> 21:00.432
Well, we have a problem.
I don't take orders from poultry.

21:01.607 --> 21:04.440
No, Rimmer, make that eight years!

21:04.577 --> 21:07.068
Fine. I'll make a note of it.

21:08.781 --> 21:13.741
Eight... years... There we go.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.527
- Is Kristine in?
- No, she's on planet leave.

21:24.663 --> 21:26.995
Oh, smeg. Where's she staying?

21:27.132 --> 21:30.727
- The Ganymede Holiday Inn.
- Cheers.

21:42.648 --> 21:46.584
(LISTER)... A-N-S-K-I. Kochanski. Look...

21:51.824 --> 21:55.282
<i>(SUITCASE) Excuse me. No, down here.</i>

21:55.427 --> 21:59.864
<i>Have you seen a man who's lost his luggage?</i>

21:59.999 --> 22:02.559
- No.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

22:02.701 --> 22:05.693
<i>I bet he's gone to the wrong airport again.</i>

22:07.339 --> 22:09.239
Ah! Dog!

22:09.375 --> 22:12.139
And he's trying to strangle that woman!

22:24.323 --> 22:27.087
Don't worry, madam.
His strangling days are over!

22:27.226 --> 22:32.357
Cat, I've got it. 008. This way!
Why are you attacking people's clothing?

22:34.833 --> 22:35.925
Yeah!

22:53.052 --> 22:55.043
She's already married.

22:58.323 --> 23:00.723
What about the photograph?

23:04.430 --> 23:07.729
I'm not the groom. He's the groom!

23:07.866 --> 23:11.358
(CAT) She's not as stupid as we thought!

23:18.043 --> 23:21.945
Why do women always leave me
for total smegheads?

23:22.081 --> 23:26.017
Why do they dump me for men
who wear turtlenecks and smoke pipes?

23:26.151 --> 23:28.642
I mean, natural yogurt eaters.

23:28.787 --> 23:34.589
Reliable, sensible, dependable,
and lots of other words that end in "ible."

23:34.727 --> 23:37.252
I bet he's obsessed with house prices

23:37.396 --> 23:42.493
and spends life in antique fairs
looking for bargains and drinking wine.

23:42.634 --> 23:46.832
It's never beer, is it? It's always wine.

23:46.972 --> 23:51.568
"What do you want on your cornflakes?"
"I'll have wine, please!"

23:51.710 --> 23:53.234
Smeg!

23:56.215 --> 23:59.378
You can tell all that just from a photograph?

24:02.387 --> 24:05.584
<i>(HOLLY) Oi, not your pockets.</i>

24:05.724 --> 24:10.593
<i>It's horrible down there.</i>
<i>There's a big hole. It's an unbelievable view.</i>

24:10.729 --> 24:14.722
<i>Reminds me of that film,</i>
<i>Attack Of The Killer Gooseberries.</i>

24:14.867 --> 24:16.767
Come on, Hol. I'm broken up.

24:16.902 --> 24:21.339
<i>I was in love once... a Sinclair ZX-81.</i>

24:21.473 --> 24:23.941
<i>People said, "Holly, she's not for you."</i>

24:24.076 --> 24:28.877
<i>She was cheap, stupid and wouldn't load.</i>
<i>Not for me, anyway.</i>

24:29.882 --> 24:34.717
- What are you trying to say, Hol?
<i>- It's better to have loved and lost</i>

24:34.853 --> 24:37.117
<i>than to listen to Olivia Newton-John.</i>

24:37.256 --> 24:41.420
- Why's that?
<i>- Anything's better than that.</i>

24:43.829 --> 24:46.730
- Hi. It's you.
- Hi.

24:46.865 --> 24:50.062
- Come in.
- No, we were just passing.

24:50.202 --> 24:52.727
- Come in.
- No, it's OK.

24:52.871 --> 24:55.738
Cat! Come on, we've got to go!

24:55.874 --> 24:58.741
(CAT) Aow!

25:00.946 --> 25:04.006
- I just got married.
- Oh, great.

25:04.149 --> 25:08.984
- He's in the shower. You'll like him.
- Oh, I bet.

25:09.888 --> 25:13.085
- Do you want a screwdriver?
- I'd rather have a hammer.

25:16.061 --> 25:18.723
How you doin', kid?

25:21.300 --> 25:23.825
What is this? An ugly convention?

25:23.969 --> 25:28.030
- Where did you come from?
- The bathroom.

25:28.173 --> 25:31.404
- You don't look pleased to see me.
- Frankly, I'm not.

25:31.543 --> 25:34.341
I thought I was getting married.

25:34.479 --> 25:36.606
- (KOCHANSKl) You did.
- HE did.

25:36.748 --> 25:40.445
- He's you.
- No, I'm me. He's him.

25:40.586 --> 25:46.650
If he's you and you're him
and he's him... am I still me?

25:46.792 --> 25:49.556
Who's eatin' this chicken?

25:49.695 --> 25:52.823
- What the hell is going on?
- Look... Listen...

25:52.965 --> 25:56.765
In five years,
you find a way to come back in time.

25:56.902 --> 25:59.928
- So, it does work out?
- Eventually.

26:00.072 --> 26:02.666
How about a frenchie from me future bride?

26:02.808 --> 26:06.107
No way. On your space-bike.

26:11.183 --> 26:13.845
So, listen... What do I do now?

26:13.986 --> 26:18.980
- Go back and wait for five years.
- Have I always been such a smeghead?

26:19.124 --> 26:25.120
- You've always been like that.
- So, you've lived the last five years.

26:25.264 --> 26:28.631
What's the single most important piece
of advice that you can give me?

26:28.767 --> 26:30.894
Erm... Oh, yeah.

26:31.036 --> 26:35.939
Three years from now,
you'll enter a parallel universe.

26:36.074 --> 26:40.340
You'll materialize on an exact
replica of Earth in the year 1989.

26:40.479 --> 26:45.314
You'll want to go to the theatre.
Don't see Run For Your Wife.

26:47.819 --> 26:50.049
- Smeghead.
- And you.

27:16.248 --> 27:19.775
We've pumped your stomach,
we've changed your blood. Get some rest.

27:19.918 --> 27:22.443
So, they won't come back again?

27:22.587 --> 27:26.887
Just stay calm,
keep cool and get some sleep.

27:27.025 --> 27:31.962
There he is. Sleeping like a baby.
I'm going to kill him.

27:32.097 --> 27:34.691
If you need anything, call Holly.

27:45.877 --> 27:48.072
(RIMMER'S VOICE) Don't panic, Arnold,

27:48.213 --> 27:53.241
but I've had a think,
and I think I can explain this to you.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.588
(RIMMER) Hi.

27:57.723 --> 28:02.160
- Hi. I'm staying calm this time.
- Good.

28:02.294 --> 28:05.263
There you are. I've been looking everywhere.

28:05.397 --> 28:09.026
- Not now, Lister.
- TWO Listers!

28:09.167 --> 28:11.567
And a strange man with large teeth!

28:11.703 --> 28:17.471
- Hey, I'm a cat.
- Of course! Come in! Sit down!

28:18.610 --> 28:22.740
- Yo!
- Three Listers! Splendid!

28:22.881 --> 28:26.009
Perhaps Lister here would go to the fridge

28:26.151 --> 28:29.052
and open some wine for Lister and Lister?

28:29.187 --> 28:31.883
Rimmer here doesn't drink, because he's dead,

28:32.024 --> 28:34.049
but I wouldn't mind a glass.

28:34.192 --> 28:39.494
Don't get into a flap, but I'm the Rimmer
from the double-double future.

28:39.631 --> 28:43.499
I'm the Rimmer who's with the Lister
who married Kochanski.

28:43.635 --> 28:47.036
From here on, things get a bit confusing...

28:47.172 --> 28:49.163
(ALL CHATTER)

28:50.175 --> 28:56.774
Please, before anyone says anything else,
I'd like to make a little speech.

28:56.915 --> 28:58.405
(SCREAMS) Go away!

29:02.354 --> 29:05.915
It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

29:06.058 --> 29:09.186
<i>I'm all alone, more or less</i>

29:09.327 --> 29:12.660
<i>Let me fly far away from here</i>

29:12.798 --> 29:15.790
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

29:15.934 --> 29:19.062
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

29:19.204 --> 29:22.640
<i>I want to lie,</i>
<i>shipwrecked and comatose</i>

29:22.774 --> 29:25.902
<i>Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

29:26.044 --> 29:29.207
<i>Goldfish shoals,</i>
<i>nibbling at my</i> toes

29:29.347 --> 29:32.043
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

29:32.184 --> 29:35.779
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

29:35.921 --> 29:38.583
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

29:38.723 --> 29:42.284
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>
