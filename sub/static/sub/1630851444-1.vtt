WEBVTT

00:18.769 --> 00:21.313
I'm Eep. Of the Croods clan.

00:24.983 --> 00:25.567
Gotcha!

00:28.779 --> 00:30.531
And I'm on the hunt.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.449
But not for food.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.576
That's old Eep. I'm new Eep.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.581
Whoo!

00:43.710 --> 00:44.670
Ha!

00:48.048 --> 00:50.676
And new Eep just needs a pen.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.793
‐ Dear Bark Journal,

01:24.793 --> 01:26.879
so what put the new in new me?

01:26.879 --> 01:29.256
I'm glad I asked myself that question.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.591
I was walking with my family,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.259
my dad Grug, my mom Ugga,

01:32.259 --> 01:34.261
my little brother Thunk,
my little sister Sandy,

01:34.261 --> 01:36.054
my gran Gran, and Guy,

01:36.054 --> 01:39.391
as in my guy,
the guy of my dreams but real.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.434
And we hit a wall.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.894
So, of course, Dad smashed through it.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.353
And there was a farm and a tree house.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.148
And a family, the Bettermans,
Phil, Hope and their daughter Dawn.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.692
They weren't happy about their wall,
and we didn't get along.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.361
But then we were attacked
by these crazy punch monkeys

01:51.361 --> 01:52.696
so we had to team up to survive.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.574
It went so well,
the Bettermans invited us to move in,

01:55.574 --> 01:57.534
and, boom, first neighborhood ever!

01:57.534 --> 01:59.328
And, boom, again, first best friend ever!

01:59.328 --> 02:00.370
Dawn rocks!

02:00.370 --> 02:01.580
But the punch monkeys don't,

02:01.580 --> 02:04.041
so welcome back, wall,
and hello, peace and quiet.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.293
Yep, the Croods are livin' easy now.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.128
Except it's not so easy.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.967
‐ Is it night yet?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.928
‐ No, honey, we just woke up.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.554
‐ Aw, come on!

02:17.554 --> 02:20.140
No hunting, no chasing.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.350
‐ No fighting.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.228
‐ Sorry, Sandy.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.395
Nothing to fight here.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.856
The farm has food, shelter, and safety.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.733
It's comfortable, predictable‐‐

02:29.733 --> 02:32.486
‐ And so‐o‐o‐o boring!

02:32.486 --> 02:34.404
‐ Relaxing?

02:34.404 --> 02:36.198
Good. Keep doing that.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.824
‐ Can we help with anything, Hope?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.202
‐ Nope. Everything's taken care of.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.120
Ew!

02:42.120 --> 02:43.997
So I'll make lunch

02:43.997 --> 02:45.624
and you stay out of the way
and do nothing.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.458
Bye!

02:46.458 --> 02:47.835
‐ Do nothing?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.044
We're the Croods!

02:49.044 --> 02:50.587
We hunt Kangadillos.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.172
We topple trees.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.049
We paint the things we do on rocks.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.093
We gotta have a purpose on this farm.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.596
Because, if we don't,
we're as useless as a slugopotamus.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.307
And the Croods aren't slugopotomuses.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.475
‐ As far as we know.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.727
‐ Is doing nothing really so bad?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.229
Look how happy Douglas is.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.233
See? I've always said moving is overrated.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.945
Oh, uh, could someone
move my cup closer to my mouth?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.280
‐ Thunk's right.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.739
Down time has an upside.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.117
More time for stolen kisses.

03:21.410 --> 03:22.578
‐ Morning, Guy.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.960
‐ More time for careless whispers. Whoops.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.920
‐ Hmm. More time for cuddling.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.463
‐ No. No time for cuddling.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.965
‐ Wh... What about the sleep pile?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.800
We did that every night in our old life.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.346
‐ That's family cuddling.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.472
It's completely different.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.851
‐ Fine. New Eep and Guy
can cuddle with our eyes.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.227
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.353
‐ Hey!

03:48.353 --> 03:50.606
‐ Hey! Something to do just ran by.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.024
Mom's right.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.192
Pigator on the loose.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.402
‐ Let's grab it and stab it!

03:55.402 --> 03:59.406
‐ Or, we can redirect that stabbing energy
into something less stabby.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.202
‐ Uh, I'm still waiting for someone
to move my cup. Yeah.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.354
‐ Ooh!

04:32.022 --> 04:33.941
‐ Aw!

04:33.941 --> 04:34.816
Morning, Phil.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.859
‐ Good morning.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.694
Just testing my new trap.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.155
So no more runaway pigators.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.074
‐ But we were gonna catch that pigator.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.368
‐ No need. This trap is flawless.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.703
Just like the rest of the system
that runs this farm.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.164
So keep doing nothing, Croods.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.791
It suits you.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.458
‐ What was that?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.210
‐ Oh, that's a bounceberry.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.795
They're ripe. It's time to harvest them.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.088
‐ Ooh! Uh, we'll do that!

04:56.088 --> 04:57.631
‐ Oh, I don't think so.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.217
Bounceberries are a favorite fruit
around here.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.803
And they can be tricky. Even dangerous.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.805
‐ Great! We love danger. We're in.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.431
‐ You're out. It's taken care of.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.809
‐ Uh, let me guess. By the system?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.395
‐ Precisely. With me at the helm.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.107
So, if you'll excuse me,
I need to limber up before the harvest.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.818
Time for a steam in the man cave.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.696
‐ Come on.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.240
There has to be something
we can do around here

05:23.240 --> 05:25.242
‐ You know who has ideas?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.703
Guy‐Boy, I can hear those wheels turning.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.204
‐ You get one pet name a day.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.914
So that's it. You're done.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.084
‐ Well, one idea is both sides compromise
and live in peace.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.794
‐ Ha. That'll never work.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.130
‐ You just need
something to do to be happy.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.257
But it doesn't have to be work, right?

05:40.257 --> 05:41.383
So, how about a game?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.676
Ooh. How about this,

05:42.676 --> 05:44.970
you find something
and then you throw it?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.141
It's called "Throw."

05:51.268 --> 05:53.145
Yeah. Throw might need some work.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.229
‐ Better idea,

05:54.229 --> 05:56.190
we stop doing
what Phil and Hope tell us to do

05:56.190 --> 05:57.983
and we start doing
what we wanna do.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.234
Because this is our home now.

05:59.234 --> 05:59.902
‐ Yes.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.112
‐ Grug, go tell Phil
that's what's happening.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.697
‐ Aw, in the steam?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.158
‐ Yes. And I'll tell Hope
I'm gonna help her.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.242
Whether she likes it or not.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.744
‐ Dawn will love this.

06:08.744 --> 06:11.371
Her whole life, her parents have been
so worried about her getting hurt,

06:11.371 --> 06:12.956
they've never let her do anything.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.374
Let's go, Guy‐baby.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.710
‐ One pet name a day. That's two.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.886
‐ You're always welcome
in my man cave, Grug.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.305
My steam is your steam.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.556
‐ Uh, yeah, thanks.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.225
So I'm here to tell you‐‐

06:36.104 --> 06:37.147
So I'm here to‐‐

06:46.448 --> 06:48.367
I'm here to tell you things‐‐

06:49.201 --> 06:50.744
are going to change around here.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.954
‐ Of course.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.455
Let's talk about that.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.082
‐ Great, so we're gonna‐‐

06:55.082 --> 06:56.625
‐ After the steam.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.960
‐ Right, but‐but Ugga said‐‐

06:57.960 --> 06:59.670
‐ Steam first, talk after.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.171
‐ Okay, but, uh, I'm‐‐

07:01.171 --> 07:03.048
‐ Steam, then talk.

07:03.048 --> 07:03.590
‐ But‐‐

07:03.590 --> 07:04.633
‐ Steam, talk.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.513
‐ Well, how long of a steam?

07:10.556 --> 07:11.515
Phil?

07:11.515 --> 07:13.308
Phil? Phil?

07:13.308 --> 07:14.810
Phil, where'd you go? Phil!

07:14.810 --> 07:15.894
‐ Yes?

07:19.857 --> 07:23.360
See? You're completely relaxed,
thanks to the steam.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.364
‐ So sweet of you to offer.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.408
But I'm making lunch. Okay?

07:29.408 --> 07:31.994
‐ No. We're making lunch. Together.

07:31.994 --> 07:35.163
‐ Ohh. You wanna help make lunch?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.081
In my kitchen?

07:36.081 --> 07:36.915
‐ Our kitchen.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.253
‐ Of course. Our kitchen.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.713
Because you live here now.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.465
So we share the kitchen,
that was once mine. Good.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.550
‐ I'm glad you're not upset.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.969
‐ Upset?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.929
In the kitchen I helped build from nothing

07:50.929 --> 07:53.473
that I never had to share with
anyone before now?

07:53.473 --> 07:56.310
How could I be upset? That's crazy.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.729
‐ We're cooking meat, right?

07:58.729 --> 08:01.607
Because that's all I eat. Meat.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.859
‐ Oh, good. More help.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.361
Well, we're making soup, so‐‐

08:06.361 --> 08:07.905
‐ Soup? You got it.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.205
‐ So you don't know what soup is.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.247
‐ Nope.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.668
‐ Ew.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.756
‐ You're saying we're gonna
do something around here?

08:26.423 --> 08:28.509
But my parents
don't want me doing anything.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.093
Even playing Throw like this.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.094
'Cause they think I'll die.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.846
‐ I'm so glad you guys like Throw.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.431
‐ Forget your parents.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.308
Because we're not gonna do anything.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.061
We're gonna do everything.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.687
Whoa, game changer.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.482
You're saying I could eat
breakfast for dinner?

08:43.482 --> 08:45.526
I could get dirty and stay dirty?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.236
I could tell my parents what to do?

08:47.236 --> 08:49.279
‐ Exactly. And that's just the start.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.781
‐ Breakfast‐dinner? The best.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.241
Dirt? Never gets old.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.493
But I think your parents
like to be in charge.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.954
It's their thing.
So maybe we start smaller.

08:56.954 --> 08:57.788
‐ Smaller how?

08:57.788 --> 09:01.124
‐ Well, what if we added
something to Throw, like catching?

09:01.124 --> 09:02.876
Ooh! We could call it Catch.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.004
‐ Hey, uh, could one of you
move my cup closer to my mouth?

09:06.004 --> 09:07.631
‐ Or you could just get your cup.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.590
‐ Are you nuts?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.676
It's all the way across the farm
by my hammock.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.970
‐ Thunk, wanna play Catch? Catch.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.849
‐ Or we go bigger. Bigger like a‐‐

09:16.849 --> 09:18.934
Bounceberry.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.561
Let's bounce!

09:31.530 --> 09:32.781
‐ Lunch is served.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.410
‐ Which is what I used to say
because I always served lunch.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.703
But now Ugga's doing it.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.288
And I'm fine with that.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.914
Because I have to be.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.957
Or do I?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.669
‐ Wh‐‐ What? Why would you‐‐

09:45.669 --> 09:47.629
‐ Oops. Ugga spilled the soup.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.340
But don't worry, I'll make a new lunch.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.633
‐ We'll make a new lunch.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.385
‐ Perfect.

09:54.136 --> 09:56.722
‐ At least they have
something to do. Lucky.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.223
Well, so do we.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.224
Bounceberries.

09:59.224 --> 09:59.933
‐ Bounceberries?

09:59.933 --> 10:00.851
‐ Bounceberries!

10:00.851 --> 10:02.060
‐ Bananas!

10:02.895 --> 10:04.146
We're saying fruits, right?

10:04.146 --> 10:06.315
‐ Uh, no. Bounceberries.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.733
We're gonna help you harvest them.

10:07.733 --> 10:11.153
‐ And you will not... uh, stop me?

10:11.153 --> 10:12.404
‐ Strong start, Dawn. Keep going.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.407
‐ Because, you don't... own me!

10:16.617 --> 10:17.784
‐ Comin' in a little hot, Dawn.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.077
‐ Let's do this.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.622
I know nothing about bounceberries
but they're my jam.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.248
Ooh, bounceberry jam.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.458
Great idea.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.542
We'll make it together, Hope.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.418
‐ Sure.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.504
First lunch, then bounceberry jam.

10:28.504 --> 10:31.840
In fact, why don't you just
make a to‐do leaf for us?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.425
‐ Already done. Here you go.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.930
‐ So it's settled.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.556
We'll all harvest
the bounceberries together?

10:39.556 --> 10:42.601
‐ Done deal! Bounceberries! Boom!

10:42.601 --> 10:44.353
‐ You're heating up
instead of cooling down, Dawn.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.814
‐ I'm sorry, Croods,
but we have a system here.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.025
And, if you disrupt it,
there could be chaos.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.485
‐ Works for me.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.407
‐ Ugh. You keep saying system.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.367
What system?

11:00.619 --> 11:04.831
‐ I spent years creating
an intricate system to run our farm.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.958
Don't touch the system.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.086
Our food, our water,
even our cooling breezes

11:09.086 --> 11:11.713
are made possible by the system.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.799
I said, don't touch the system.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.634
"Don't" is the key word.

11:15.634 --> 11:19.346
For example, these vines
gently gather chicken seal eggs

11:19.346 --> 11:23.267
and carry them to baskets
without cracking a single egg.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.519
It's a flawless system.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.983
Ugh!

11:32.568 --> 11:36.029
Which is why I said... don't touch it.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.489
Whew. There you are.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.449
I've been looking
all over the farm for you guys.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.578
Hey, uh, could someone please
move my cup closer to my‐‐

11:49.334 --> 11:51.670
‐ If your system's so great,
why did it break?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.964
‐ Yeah, we don't break.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.924
Guess we're better than your system.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.968
‐ You? Better than my system?

12:00.137 --> 12:00.888
Preposterous.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.307
‐ Try us. On the bounceberries.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.725
‐ Eep can do it, Phil.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.894
When she goes after something,
she gets it.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.895
Like my heart.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.318
‐ Well, unlike your heart,
I can't risk the bounceberry harvest.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.236
They're too delicious to squander.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.531
So only the Bettermans
can tame the bouncy beast.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.074
‐ What? We hate doing it.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.993
We only do it because we have no choice.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.454
And you almost die during every harvest.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.788
Oh, no!

12:26.788 --> 12:28.207
No, no, no!

12:29.166 --> 12:31.043
Help! They're gonna get me!

12:31.043 --> 12:32.794
‐ This year we have a choice.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.964
The Croods wanna help, so let them.

12:35.964 --> 12:36.965
‐ You're right.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.801
Why stand in the way
of the Croods' happiness?

12:39.801 --> 12:42.721
Besides, what's the worst
that could happen?

12:42.721 --> 12:44.264
Ugh.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.518
‐ Boy, those eggs
were really up there, huh?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.521
‐ Bounceberries, they may look fun,

12:50.521 --> 12:51.480
but they're not.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.606
‐ Because they're heavy?

12:52.606 --> 12:53.774
No problem.
‐ No.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.526
‐ Poisonous?
‐ Seriously?

12:55.526 --> 12:57.319
They're called bounceberries.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.445
‐ Right.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.656
So they stink.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.490
‐ So close.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.991
But I think they bounce.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.660
Because bounce‐berries.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.245
Ohh!

13:06.245 --> 13:08.038
‐ And they're hard to catch

13:08.038 --> 13:09.540
because the moment they leave the bush,

13:09.540 --> 13:11.083
they bounce for the hills.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.292
‐ No problem.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.129
Eep, Guy, you run point
and drive the berries forward.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.965
Gran, Sandy, you're in the wings.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.008
And you'll all herd the berries
to this point here

13:20.008 --> 13:21.426
so Ugga and I can catch them.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.387
‐ What about me? What's my job?

13:23.387 --> 13:26.431
‐ Oh, Dawn. This is too dangerous for you.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.768
You could get bruised.
Or bumped. Or tired.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.770
You can watch from behind that rock.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.731
‐ No. You can't make me
watch my life anymore.

13:34.731 --> 13:38.110
'Cause now I'm gonna live it!

13:39.361 --> 13:41.822
I‐I mean, if that's okay with you, Mom.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.282
‐ Nice heat adjustment, Dawn.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.368
‐ Very well, let's do a trial run
with a few bushes.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.161
A dry bounce, if you will.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.538
But first, some rules.

13:49.538 --> 13:53.166
Rule number one, do not eat
the bounceberries when harvesting them.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.877
Here's why‐‐

13:56.795 --> 13:58.964
Go!

14:03.886 --> 14:06.972
Ha!

14:06.972 --> 14:08.473
‐ Wanna bounce, Guy‐lyface?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.100
‐ Only if I'm bouncing with you, Eepykins.

14:10.100 --> 14:10.726
Ooh!

14:10.726 --> 14:12.227
‐ That's three pet names today!

14:12.227 --> 14:13.228
Three!

14:13.228 --> 14:14.646
Way too many.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.073
Focus!

14:31.038 --> 14:33.415
‐ That's not harvesting.
That's frolicking.

14:33.415 --> 14:36.335
‐ If you're enjoying it,
you're doing it wrong.

14:52.267 --> 14:56.063
‐ My dad was right.
This is just like a kangadillo chase!

14:56.063 --> 14:58.899
‐ Even better,
everyone's cooperating and happy‐‐

14:58.899 --> 14:59.691
Aah!

14:59.691 --> 15:00.734
Except me.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.612
‐ Your head looks like a bounceberry.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.405
Yah!

15:08.575 --> 15:10.452
‐ Oh, no! Where are Mom and Dad?

15:10.452 --> 15:13.956
‐ They're MIA! Sandy, break those berries.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.587
I got this one!

15:20.587 --> 15:22.422
No, I don't!

15:23.423 --> 15:24.758
Dawn!

15:24.758 --> 15:26.009
Whoa!

15:26.844 --> 15:28.804
‐ Never fear. I'll catch you.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.516
Sorry, Dad!

15:32.516 --> 15:33.892
‐ Nice catch, Phil.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.562
‐ Sorry, Mom!

15:36.562 --> 15:39.523
‐ Oh, no! I think these bounceberries
are going for a swim.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.149
‐ Oh, no, they're not.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.367
‐ Who wants bounceberries?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.077
‐ I do. Eat up, gang.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.291
Mm! Mm!

15:58.500 --> 15:59.418
No!

15:59.418 --> 16:01.753
I told you not to eat them.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.091
‐ Why not? We caught it. We eat it.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.469
‐ Right. Also, sticky.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.638
Woo‐hoo!
‐ No!

16:11.638 --> 16:12.514
‐ Whoo!

16:12.514 --> 16:13.807
I'm alive!

16:13.807 --> 16:15.893
And stuck.

16:15.893 --> 16:16.768
‐ Ugh.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.353
‐ I don't mind being stuck.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.229
I mind.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.647
Stop sticking!

16:21.565 --> 16:22.816
No, no, no, Sandy, don't‐‐

16:24.151 --> 16:26.111
Uh... never mind, sweetie.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.614
‐ That's why you can't eat them
during the harvest.

16:28.614 --> 16:30.949
The berry juice makes you sticky.

16:30.949 --> 16:34.036
And when you're sticky,
you can't harvest berries.

16:34.036 --> 16:34.995
Just ask Hope.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.334
‐ Yep.

16:40.334 --> 16:41.627
I learned the hard way.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.545
And I guess I get to do it again this year

16:43.545 --> 16:47.049
on top of completely losing control
of everything in my life!

16:47.049 --> 16:50.093
‐ So, now that you're all too sticky
to finish the harvest,

16:50.093 --> 16:52.846
we have to find another solution
so we don't have to do it.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.265
‐ Huh? Huh? What about us?

16:55.265 --> 16:56.975
They just left us.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.061
‐ You think that's bad?
I'm their daughter.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.355
‐ Don't worry. I'll get us free.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.315
Just need to use some muscle.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.276
Or a lot of muscle.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.280
‐ Or we wait for them to come back.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.491
‐ Hang tight! I'll kick you loose.

17:12.491 --> 17:14.076
‐ No! Anything but your‐‐

17:14.701 --> 17:18.080
‐ Guy, get your face off my feet.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.792
‐ It's okay, guys. Thunk'll save us.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.962
That's good.

17:24.962 --> 17:28.006
‐ Cup... too far.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.385
‐ They're not coming back.

17:31.385 --> 17:35.055
‐ It's fine. Because we're going to
pull ourselves apart on three.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.056
Ready?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.766
One‐‐
‐ For freedom!

17:45.774 --> 17:49.027
‐ That didn't work.
But it did bring us closer together.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.197
So close, it's hard to imagine
being apart from you.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.533
‐ Oh, Guy. You're so romantic.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.451
‐ No. No romance.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.661
We're stuck here forever.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.788
We need to decide which one of us
we're gonna eat first.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.583
Ha‐ha! I knew you'd come back.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.376
Didn't doubt it for a second.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.919
You‐you can get us free, right?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.337
For freedom!

18:07.337 --> 18:09.298
‐ Of course. All it takes is water.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.635
‐ Water? That's it?

18:13.635 --> 18:15.429
Why didn't you free us right away then?

18:15.429 --> 18:18.182
‐ Free you? When the bounceberries
are ready to be harvested?

18:18.182 --> 18:19.641
One must have priorities.

18:19.641 --> 18:23.395
‐ And priority number one
is making sure we don't have to do it.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.648
‐ Yes, as we recently established,
I don't enjoy it.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.609
And you don't follow directions.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.777
But now it's in good hands.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.279
Or should I say fists?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.614
‐ Why would you say fists?

18:37.159 --> 18:38.535
Punch monkeys?

18:38.535 --> 18:39.328
‐ Not good.

18:39.328 --> 18:42.956
‐ Why? Because punch monkeys
do nothing but punch, steal, lie, destroy

18:42.956 --> 18:45.292
and generally make our lives
more difficult in every way?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.419
‐ True, we've had our differences.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.420
But that's history.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.131
They're strong, fast,
they've got big hands,

18:51.131 --> 18:52.424
and unlike you, they listen.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.387
So I asked them to give us a fist
and they said yes.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.223
‐ But this was our job.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.808
‐ And now it's not. Isn't that great?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.520
‐ No! This was our purpose.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.563
It was gonna save us from being useless.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.814
Like a slugopotamus.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.566
‐ And I'm no slugopotamus.

19:09.566 --> 19:12.402
‐ No, you're like
a beautiful meteor shower.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.570
But on the ground.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.988
‐ Comin' in a little hot, Guy.
‐ Okay.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.200
‐ And you have a lot to learn
about meteor showers.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.746
Now, gawk as the punch monkeys
do what you couldn't,

19:22.746 --> 19:24.289
finish the harvest.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.458
And for a mere one banana per monkey.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.794
‐ Someone should tell them that.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.548
‐ What are you doing? Stop!

19:34.383 --> 19:36.343
Huh. I don't understand that punch.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.720
Uh, Guy, you speak
better punch monkey than I do.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.429
What did he say?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.974
‐ He said you told them that they could
take all the bananas they want.

19:41.974 --> 19:42.975
‐ What? No!

19:42.975 --> 19:44.476
That's a mis‐puncher‐standing.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.603
I said one. Like this.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.855
‐ There's your mistake.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.356
That's not one. That's all.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.357
This means one.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.359
‐ Ooh! Really? This means one?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.944
‐ No. That means thirsty.

19:53.944 --> 19:54.945
This means one.

19:54.945 --> 19:55.529
‐ This?

19:55.529 --> 19:56.655
‐ No. This!

19:56.655 --> 19:58.448
‐ Oh. Thanks for clearing that up.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.578
What are they saying now?

20:02.578 --> 20:04.997
‐ They feel misled.
So they're gonna take all our food.

20:04.997 --> 20:07.207
Right after they trash the farm
to teach you a little lesson

20:07.207 --> 20:08.667
in honesty and integrity.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.835
‐ They said all that with punches?

20:09.835 --> 20:11.211
‐ It's a rich, mysterious language.

20:12.838 --> 20:16.884
‐ So, Croods, you still want to help
with the bounceberry harvest, yes?

20:16.884 --> 20:18.385
‐ By stopping the punch monkeys?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.469
‐ And fixing your mistake?

20:19.469 --> 20:21.013
‐ Oh, I wouldn't put it like that.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.472
‐ I would. That's exactly it.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.390
‐ We're on it.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.726
‐ And I'm all over it
because this is how I roll now!

20:25.726 --> 20:28.604
All Dawn, no rules, so deal with it!

20:28.604 --> 20:29.313
‐ Same team, Dawn.

20:29.313 --> 20:32.024
‐ Yeah. The Kill Team!

20:32.024 --> 20:33.233
‐ Uh, no.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.776
No killing necessary.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.694
Here's the plan‐‐

20:35.694 --> 20:38.822
‐ No offense, but your plan
is why we need a new plan.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.532
‐ Right. So here's the plan.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.576
Hey, punch monkeys!

20:42.576 --> 20:44.244
You forgot the bounceberries.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.662
‐ So we brought you a bunch.

20:45.662 --> 20:46.288
‐ To go.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.460
Look at us, working together,
bouncing together.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.669
This is a real moment.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.962
Whoo‐‐

20:53.962 --> 20:55.422
Woo‐hoo!

20:55.422 --> 20:56.632
Whoa!

20:56.632 --> 20:58.967
Boy, I am really up here.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.135
Oh, pretty clouds!

21:00.135 --> 21:01.220
That one looks like a pillow.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.430
And there's an egg, a coconut, Thunk,

21:03.430 --> 21:04.932
a‐a‐and going down.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.183
Whoo!

21:06.183 --> 21:07.476
Going back up.

21:07.476 --> 21:09.520
Oh, yeah!

21:09.520 --> 21:10.812
‐ Guy.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.065
‐ Hey, no bounce‐frogging.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.858
This is serious monkey business.

21:18.904 --> 21:22.699
‐ It's time to chew and shoo
these monkeys outta here.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.409
Everyone, chew!

21:26.620 --> 21:28.163
And shoo!

21:34.586 --> 21:36.380
Abandon berries!

21:41.802 --> 21:42.594
Gotcha!

21:44.930 --> 21:46.890
Phil and Hope, you're up!

21:54.147 --> 21:57.401
‐ And that's how you bounce
punch monkeys out the door.

21:57.401 --> 22:01.238
‐ Along with all our bounceberries!

22:01.238 --> 22:03.949
Except for that one. Which you are eating.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.202
Ugh!

22:07.202 --> 22:09.913
‐ The point is, we did it together.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.916
We built a bridge between ourselves
and we crossed it.

22:12.916 --> 22:16.378
‐ No. The point is,
we found our purpose here.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.297
Fixing Phil's mistakes.

22:18.297 --> 22:19.590
‐ Starting with the system.

22:19.590 --> 22:22.009
Yeah, let's crush the system!

22:22.009 --> 22:24.386
‐ Ooh. And afterwards
maybe we could play Catch.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.722
‐ No! They'll ruin the system.

22:26.722 --> 22:27.890
‐ Who cares?

22:27.890 --> 22:30.893
If they're busy, I get my kitchen back.
So I win.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.853
Which means you win.

22:32.853 --> 22:35.022
‐ You're right. High five.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.859
‐ And we're stuck.
