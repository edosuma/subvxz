00:02.369 --> 00:05.137
- Grandpa, will you help me
with my homework?

00:05.139 --> 00:07.439
- Nope.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.475
- Frank.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.676
- How else is she gonna learn?

00:10.678 --> 00:13.178
Nobody handed me
any answers.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.114
- Clearly.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.316
Listen, she's doing
a family tree for school.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.284
She has to interview
a relative.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.719
- Your favorite relative?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.621
- No.
The oldest.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.759
- Well, I'm not the oldest
person in the family.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.394
Don't you have,
like, some relatives

00:28.396 --> 00:30.062
Living in Italy
or something?

00:30.064 --> 00:32.498
- Yeah, there might be
somebody left.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.299
Most of them came over
in a sardine boat,

00:34.301 --> 00:37.102
But my father had a sister
who stayed behind in sicily.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.737
Aunt sarina.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.272
Zia sarina.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.607
- Oh, she's still alive?

00:41.609 --> 00:45.344
- Alive, dead,
who knows?

00:45.346 --> 00:46.779
- It's nice
you're so close.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.313
Hey, ally, maybe we could
write her a letter, huh?

00:48.315 --> 00:50.382
- Yeah, okay.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.383
- Ray, do you know
you might have relatives

00:51.385 --> 00:52.518
Still living in Italy?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.720
- Yeah?
Oh, great.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.720
- Hey, you know what?

00:55.722 --> 00:58.390
You might be able to use
the paper's research facilities

00:58.392 --> 01:00.325
To find her.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.294
Yeah, come on,
she's family.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.762
- Well, yeah, but...

01:06.566 --> 01:09.835
Why would we want to locate
more of these people?

01:17.243 --> 01:19.178
- Mommy, I'm hot.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.447
- Yeah.
Me too, honey.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.648
Hey, frank,

01:22.650 --> 01:24.616
I think that heat's
fixed enough, okay?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.285
Thank you.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.786
- I'll tell you
when it's fixed.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.354
[pipes clanging]

01:29.356 --> 01:31.790
Hold that pipe up, robert, okay?
Hold it up!

01:31.792 --> 01:33.425
- It's hot, dad.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.627
- What are you, a baby?
Hold it up!

01:35.629 --> 01:37.696
- Ow.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.198
- Hi, debra.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.466
- Hi, marie.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.533
- My!

01:41.535 --> 01:42.801
It's hot in here.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.203
Are you baking?

01:44.205 --> 01:47.606
Oh, what am I saying?

01:47.608 --> 01:50.109
- I asked your husband
if he knew a heating guy.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.744
Turns out he's a heating guy.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.779
- Hi.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.647
Could use some ice.

01:55.649 --> 01:59.518
- This is what happens
when frank fixes things.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.320
You remember
the chimney, robbie?

02:01.322 --> 02:04.389
- Yeah.
I told him I was too big.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.325
- Well, we're all set.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.560
- Frank,
it's a little hot in here.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.763
- You're welcome.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.133
- No, robert,
we're not having that.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.300
Here.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.903
Defrost the corn.

02:17.905 --> 02:18.904
- What are you doing?

02:18.906 --> 02:20.172
Would you feel this?

02:20.174 --> 02:21.673
It's too hot.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.576
- That's your damn
change of life.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.678
- I went through that
ten years ago.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.314
- Then how about a change
of personality?

02:29.316 --> 02:31.483
- Hey.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.386
- Oh, hi.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.787
- Okay,
I did some research.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.523
Took me three hours.
I located aunt sarina.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.857
- Oh, great!
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.259
- Really, daddy?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.326
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.362
Her name is still barone.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.763
You know,
I guess she never married,

02:44.765 --> 02:47.266
And, um, she lives in, uh,

02:47.268 --> 02:49.535
A place called bisacquino.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.703
It's in sicily,
near palermo.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.740
And she's got no phone,
no address,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.241
But you can write to her

02:56.243 --> 02:59.478
Care of
al ufficiado postale,

02:59.480 --> 03:00.879
The village post office.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.182
Why am I hot?

03:05.485 --> 03:07.452
- All right,
stop complaining.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.488
Next time,
pay a guy.

03:09.490 --> 03:13.325
- I wanted to pay a guy.
I would overpay a guy.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.660
- What did you let my father
fix the heat for?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.728
- Don't you start
with me, okay?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.764
Listen, help ally
write a letter to aunt sarina.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.766
- It's too hot now.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.868
- Come on, you know
a little italian, don't you?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.570
- Oh, hardly any.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.838
No, frank and I only spoke
italian when we were arguing

03:26.840 --> 03:29.441
So that the boys
wouldn't understand.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.577
- We're almost fluent.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.982
- Mommy,
why didn't aunt sarina

03:36.984 --> 03:38.617
Write back to me?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.285
- Oh, honey, I know
it's been three weeks,

03:40.287 --> 03:42.487
But we don't even know
if she's gotten the letter yet.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.557
Listen, I think we're just gonna
have to go with uncle mel, okay?

03:45.559 --> 03:46.992
I mean, he's really
very interesting.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.528
- And just because
I was never married

03:49.530 --> 03:51.530
Doesn't mean I'm gay.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.339
God, it's as hot as hell
in here.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.440
What are you trying to do,

04:01.442 --> 04:04.743
Sweat the truth out of me?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.645
- Mel, why don't you
just tell ally

04:06.647 --> 04:08.580
About where you grew up?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.582
- Oh. Yeah.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.985
Brooklyn was
a pretty tough neighborhood.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.920
I had at least one fight
every day.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.422
- Oh, come on, mel.
A fight every day?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.258
- That's right,
every day since I was four

04:19.260 --> 04:20.726
Until I entered the service.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.328
- Mel, that's,
like, 5,000 fights.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.830
- Well, look at me.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.703
Actually,
I joined the army

04:31.705 --> 04:33.472
To get away
from the fighting.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.973
[doorbell rings]

04:34.975 --> 04:38.043
Although fighting
is what made me tough.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.878
Do you fight yet?

04:43.283 --> 04:43.882
- Hey, uh, 320 fowler?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.385
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.420
- $45.75 plus $1.50 toll.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.788
- What?

04:49.790 --> 04:50.989
- Taxi from kennedy airport.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.991
$45.75 plus toll.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.929
And you know,
tip is good.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.998
- Taxi for who?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.400
- Ah...

05:01.402 --> 05:04.670
La mia famiglia americana!

05:04.672 --> 05:06.438
Ah!
- What?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.706
What?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.541
I'm sorry.
Who--who are you?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.043
- La signora barone?

05:11.045 --> 05:12.044
- Uh, yes.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.046
- La signorina barone!

05:14.048 --> 05:15.881
- I'm sorry, I don't...

05:15.883 --> 05:19.084
Oh, this is the letter
that we...Wrote...

05:19.086 --> 05:20.952
Oh, my gosh.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.055
Are--are you
aunt sarina from Italy?

05:23.057 --> 05:25.891
- Aunt sarina!

05:25.893 --> 05:27.659
- Oh, che bella bambina!

05:27.661 --> 05:30.462
Si, la zia sarina!

05:30.464 --> 05:31.663
- What did she say?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.998
- I don't know.
Just hug her.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.635
- Uh, the money,
please, huh?

05:36.637 --> 05:37.636
- Yeah, okay.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.004
- Uh, excuse me.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.774
Isn't anyone
going to introduce me to this...

05:42.776 --> 05:44.843
Exotic creature?

05:54.520 --> 05:57.122
[all chatting excitedly]

05:57.124 --> 05:58.757
- Delizioso! Oh!

05:58.759 --> 06:00.459
- Smells like Italy!

06:03.363 --> 06:04.763
Holy crap!
That's good!

06:04.765 --> 06:07.766
[all talking at once]

06:14.040 --> 06:15.374
- Hello, hey.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.376
Hey. Hello. Hey!

06:17.378 --> 06:18.744
- Oh, hi, ray.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.744
Listen, I've been trying
to call you.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.713
- Hey, ray, you're just in time
for pizza.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.416
- Raimondo! Oh!

06:26.486 --> 06:28.053
- [chuckling]

06:28.055 --> 06:30.522
Who is this?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.557
- It's zia sarina.
- Who?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.092
- Your aunt from Italy.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.560
- What?

06:35.562 --> 06:36.561
- Yeah.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.996
- Why?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.464
- Because you
kind of invited her.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.966
- When?
- The letter.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.434
You said,
"if you're ever in america,

06:42.436 --> 06:43.602
Come and visit us."

06:43.604 --> 06:45.904
- What, so she
hops on a plane?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.506
Well, who does that?

06:47.508 --> 06:51.410
- A person
who cares about family.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.544
Ti posso aiutare.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.545
- Oh, si.
Grazie.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.480
- I don't believe this.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.449
- Per te. Per te.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.685
- Ah, grazie.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.053
Did you know
we had an ancestor

07:02.055 --> 07:03.121
Who was a count?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.656
She said I look
just like him.

07:04.658 --> 07:05.824
That's right.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.961
- Good, great, hey,
why don't we send for him too?

07:09.963 --> 07:12.464
- Oh, ray,
come on, she's family.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.766
- Plus she says the winters
are very cold in Italy,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.535
And the heat's
not so good.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.803
The heat's good here, huh?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.137
Buono riscaldamento?

07:19.139 --> 07:21.173
- Oh, si!

07:21.175 --> 07:22.707
Molto buono.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.444
[laughing]

07:25.446 --> 07:26.778
- Wait, wait.
Where is she staying?

07:26.780 --> 07:27.846
- Here.
- Here?

07:27.848 --> 07:28.846
- She's not going to be
in the way.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.849
I--I put up a cot
in your office for her.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.219
- In my office?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.455
Dad, why can't she stay
at your house, huh?

07:36.457 --> 07:37.956
She's your father's sister.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.624
- We got only the one
extra bedroom.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.159
There's already
a relative in it.

07:41.161 --> 07:45.564
Unless you want to trade.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.466
- Raimondo e molto stanco.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.634
Perche no andate a casa vostra,
mangiarla la pizza?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.536
E ci vendiamo domani, ah?

07:51.538 --> 07:54.139
[all talking at once]

07:59.011 --> 08:00.879
- Did you see that?

08:00.881 --> 08:03.582
She said something,
and they just got up and left.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.916
What did she say?

08:04.918 --> 08:06.785
- I don't know.
How long is she staying?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.820
- As long as she can do that.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.102
- Hey.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.238
Hey. Yep.
Uh...

08:26.240 --> 08:27.706
Wait a minute.
Wait a--ew.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.108
- Oh, scusi.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.545
Non ti preocupare.
Non c'e problema.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.713

Dah.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.049
Ah, you're wearing...

08:38.051 --> 08:41.253
Okay.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.788
Look, if you're going to sleep,
I'll go upstairs.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.657
- No, no, no, no.
Tu lavora.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.025
Lavora.
- Yeah, all right.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.793
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.162
Then I'll get out of here.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.564
- Cristo.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.033
[mumbling in italian]

08:55.035 --> 08:57.302
Ooh.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.303
Sono tuoi,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.572
Tutti questi premi?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.240

Oh!

That's all.

09:08.282 --> 09:11.683
- No, ay,

09:11.685 --> 09:14.286
- Okay, molti, molti, molti.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.187
- Oh, e, e questo?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.856
Per che cosa l'ai vinto?
