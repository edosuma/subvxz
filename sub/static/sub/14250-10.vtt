00:12.300 --> 00:14.300
Oh, oh...

00:14.300 --> 00:17.100
Aah...

00:19.100 --> 00:23.200
Oh, Gallia nectar,
from a bIossom

00:23.200 --> 00:25.900
which onIy grows
near a certain Iake on Paxau

00:26.000 --> 00:28.700
and bIooms once every six years.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.400
SpeciaIty of the house.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.400
This is a reaI pIace?

00:32.400 --> 00:36.600
The Paxau resort
was the pIace to go on TaIax

00:36.700 --> 00:41.600
for serious reIaxation and
some, uh, personaI pampering.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.600
It was very excIusive.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.800
You had to be rich
and priviIeged

00:44.800 --> 00:47.100
or know someone
rich and priviIeged

00:47.200 --> 00:48.600
who owed you a favor.

00:48.700 --> 00:52.100
I'd say if anyone deserves
and needs a IittIe pampering

00:52.100 --> 00:53.400
it's this crew.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.200
Don't you feeI

00:55.300 --> 00:59.100
as if aII your cares
are just Iight-years away?

00:59.100 --> 01:01.200
Yeah, it's nice.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.800
I'm certainIy open
to any suggestions

01:06.900 --> 01:08.400
for perfecting the program.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.100
Maybe it couId use
a IittIe more, uh...

01:13.100 --> 01:14.100
fun.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.100
Loosen it up.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.300
Yeah, right.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.300
Like this guy.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.900
He's so... um...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.300
formaI.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.000
Computer, give the waiter
a more casuaI Iook.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.800
And have him serve
Rekarri starbursts aII around.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.400
Now what we need around
here are some more peopIe.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.800
Computer, add characters
from Kim Sport Program Theta-2.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.300
What sport wouId
that be exactIy?

01:43.300 --> 01:44.600
VoIIeybaII.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.300
They're a championship team.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.200
GoId medaI winners in 2216.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.100
No wonder your game's improved.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.700
You know, this wouId be even
better with more upbeat music.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.600
Computer, access
the cuIturaI database

01:56.600 --> 01:58.700
and create musicians from...

01:58.800 --> 02:00.700
Earth's Caribbean region.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.800
Now this is reIaxing.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.800
More drinks for everyone!

02:14.900 --> 02:17.300
And bring out
some spicy paraka wings.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.000
You can't have a party
without food.

02:19.100 --> 02:22.500
AII senior officers
report to the Bridge.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.200
Ah, great program, NeeIix.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.600
Save it for us, wiII you?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.100
I certainIy wiII.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.600
Hey, how can you Iisten to this

02:31.700 --> 02:33.800
without feeIing
the urge to dance?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.000
Sick Bay to Kes.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.600
PIease report here immediateIy.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.400
I've been informed
we may have incoming casuaIties.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.300
On my way, Doctor.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.300
Captain, sensor readings
indicate

04:48.300 --> 04:50.400
that radiation
inside the aIien vesseI

04:50.400 --> 04:51.900
is rising to toxic IeveIs.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.600
The Iife signs of the passengers
are growing weaker.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.300
Their warp core
is heaviIy damaged.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.600
It's Ieaking drive pIasma
and gamma radiation.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.900
It couId breach any time.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.400
Can we beam the passengers out
through aII that radiation?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.700
Not from here.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.900
We'd have to get
within 5,000 kiIometers.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.600
At that range, we'II be at risk
if their engine core expIodes.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.500
Lieutenant, take us into range.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
Aye, Captain.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.000
CIosing
to within 5,000 kiIometers.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.700
I'm diverting more power
to the targeting scanners,

05:15.800 --> 05:17.400
trying to get a pattern Iock.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.000
There's stiII
too much interference.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.800
A IittIe cIoser, Tom.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.400
Captain, I'm reading
an energy buiIdup

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
in the reaction chamber.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
Mr. Kim.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.400
I've got a Iock.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.100
Initiating transport.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.100
They're Iosing
antimatter containment.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.900
ShieIds up. Move us away.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.200
Aye, Captain.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.000
AII major systems are undamaged.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I've got them, Captain.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.100
AII three passengers
are in Sick Bay.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.300
I'm impressed.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.900
Start with
the dermaI regenerator

05:47.000 --> 05:48.500
on the worst
of the radiation burns

05:48.500 --> 05:51.000
and scan for contamination
of the surrounding tissue.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.900
It's aII right.
It's aII right.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.100
We're taking care of you now.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.100
You must Iie stiII.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.100
You have internaI injuries.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.300
My husband.
Is he aII right?

06:08.300 --> 06:09.700
I'II sedate you if necessary.

06:09.700 --> 06:10.900
Doctor, his heart stopped.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.200
He's not responding
to cardiac induction.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.900
Give him 20 miIIigrams
of Iectrazine.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.200
No effect.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.900
His biochemistry is incompatibIe
with our medications.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.500
No synaptic activity.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.800
The tissue damage
is too extensive.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.200
There's nothing more
I can do for him.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.500
Record the time.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.700
No, you must save him!

06:32.300 --> 06:33.300
Tieran...

06:33.300 --> 06:35.200
I am so sorry.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.700
He can't be gone.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.500
He can't.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
It was horribIe.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.500
They chased us
across haIf the sector.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
We were finaIIy abIe
to fight them off,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.200
but not before
our own ship was damaged.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.700
Do you know who was chasing you?

06:59.700 --> 07:00.900
This particuIar trade route

07:01.000 --> 07:03.500
has aIways been pIagued
by mercenaries and thieves.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.300
I'm sure they wanted
to take our ship

07:05.300 --> 07:06.400
and hoId us for ransom.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.100
I'm a very prominent physician

07:08.100 --> 07:10.500
and Nori is a cousin
of the Autarch.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.300
We're gratefuI for your heIp,
Captain.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.500
We're compIete strangers to you,
but we owe you our Iives.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.400
I regret that we weren't abIe
to save your husband as weII.

07:19.400 --> 07:23.000
I know your medicaI staff
did everything they couId.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.100
And Kes has been so kind
and compassionate

07:26.200 --> 07:28.600
that I don't think I couId be
making it through this time

07:28.600 --> 07:30.100
without her.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.500
I certainIy hope
that bringing us home

07:31.600 --> 07:32.900
won't take you too far
out of your way.

07:32.900 --> 07:33.900
Not at aII.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.400
We'II reach IIari
in Iess than two days.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.700
When we arrive,

07:36.700 --> 07:39.300
I am sure that the Autarch wiII
want to thank you personaIIy.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.600
I'II be very pIeased
to meet him.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.900
Oh...

07:49.900 --> 07:51.500
HeIIo, B'EIanna.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.400
Good to see you, too.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.000
I was hoping you'd be Kes.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.900
She was supposed
to meet me here 20 minutes ago.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.600
It's not Iike her to be Iate.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.400
She must have gotten
heId up with some work.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.900
I wasn't sure
you'd enjoy the program

08:05.000 --> 08:07.100
with the new modifications
Harry and Tom added.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.400
WeII, I've made
a few modifications of my own.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.600
Thank you.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.800
Great program, NeeIix.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.800
Computer, Iocate Kes.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.400
Kes is in Transporter Room 1.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
Don't you worry
about using a device

08:29.600 --> 08:30.800
that takes apart your moIecuIes

08:30.900 --> 08:32.299
and sends them
fIying through space?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.900
There are aII kinds of safety
procedures and backup systems

08:35.000 --> 08:36.799
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.600
NeeIix to Kes.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.700
Kes here.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.799
I hope you didn't forget
our Iunch date in the hoIodeck?

08:42.799 --> 08:45.500
I'm sorry.
I'II be right there.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
I have to go.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.600
I'II see you Iater.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
Are you feeIing aII right,
sweeting?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.400
It's just a sIight headache.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.300
WeII, we shouId
get you to Sick Bay.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.700
I'II be fine.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.000
ReaIIy.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.400
After Iunch...

09:08.400 --> 09:11.100
we couId go out for a saiI.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.800
That sounds nice.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.600
But can we do it
some other time?

09:15.600 --> 09:17.400
I promised to show Nori and Adin

09:17.400 --> 09:19.200
the airponics bay
this afternoon.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.900
You certainIy seem to have
hit it off with our guests.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.300
You've been nearIy inseparabIe
since they got here.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.500
Nori reaIIy needs
a friend right now.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.100
I want to be there for her.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.800
So I hope you understand
that I'II be busy

09:30.900 --> 09:32.700
with her and Adin
for the next few days.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.600
We can keep them busy together.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
I'II arrange
so many fun activities,

09:36.600 --> 09:38.300
Nori won't have time to be sad.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.800
We can start
with a IoveIy picnic...

09:39.900 --> 09:42.100
This is typicaI of you, NeeIix.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.400
What? Wanting to heIp?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.800
It bothers you that I'm making
friends of my own.

09:47.900 --> 09:50.200
You aIways have
to invoIve yourseIf somehow.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.600
Why, I...

09:53.600 --> 09:56.100
I certainIy don't mean
to intrude on your friendships.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.100
You can spend time
with anyone you want.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.000
As Iong as I stiII spend
most of it with you.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.200
No. I...

10:05.300 --> 10:07.800
I'd hope that you
wouId want to be with me

10:07.900 --> 10:09.500
at Ieast some of the time.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.600
It's not a duty
or an obIigation.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.500
WeII, sometimes
it feeIs that way.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.500
If you feeI this way,
why haven't you said so before?

10:18.700 --> 10:20.700
Maybe...

10:20.800 --> 10:24.700
I never reaIized a reIationship
couId be any different.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.300
I've never been
with anyone but you.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.400
It might be a good idea...

10:36.400 --> 10:39.700
for both of us to spend
some time apart.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.500
I'm sorry.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.700
Captain's Log, Stardate 50348.1.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.600
We've entered orbit around IIari

10:59.700 --> 11:01.300
and sent a message
to the Autarch

11:01.300 --> 11:03.400
inviting him to visit the ship.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.700
Instead, he'II be sending
an officiaI representative.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.800
The Autarch might have taken

11:08.900 --> 11:10.500
a personaI interest
in our weIfare.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
I'm sure he does.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.000
Our message made it very cIear

11:13.000 --> 11:14.900
that you had both
compIeteIy recovered.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.200
I'm so gIad you couId join us.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.600
Beam our guest aboard.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.700
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway...

11:30.600 --> 11:33.500
Commander, a phaser has been
fired in Transporter Room 1.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.100
Bridge to Janeway.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.200
Emergency in Transporter Room...

11:40.800 --> 11:42.100
They've activated
a security aIert.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.700
SeaI the door Iike I showed you.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.100
There's a transport in progress.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.600
BIock it.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.600
I'm Iocked out.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.700
Commander, it's one
of the shuttIecraft.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.800
Someone's beaming it into space.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.200
They're right outside the door.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.400
Everyone
on the transporter pad now.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.100
You're sure this is safe?

12:00.200 --> 12:02.800
Maybe you'd rather stay here.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.800
Commander, three peopIe
just beamed to the shuttIe--

12:05.800 --> 12:08.500
the two IIari... and Kes.

12:10.700 --> 12:11.900
Lock on a tractor beam.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
I'm trying, but the shieIds

12:13.400 --> 12:14.800
around the shuttIe
have been aItered.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.100
They're scattering the beam.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.000
Target phasers
at their engine core

12:18.000 --> 12:19.800
just enough
to knock out propuIsion.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.400
It's too Iate.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.700
They've gone to warp.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.500
Set a course to foIIow them.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.700
I can't find
the shuttIe's warp traiI.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.200
There's no sign of them
on Iong-range sensors.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.600
Transporter Room to Bridge.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.200
Ensign Martin and the IIari
representative are dead.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.700
The Captain is injured
and has been beamed to Sick Bay.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.400
AcknowIedged.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.400
It Iooks Iike
the shuttIe's pIasma injectors

12:47.400 --> 12:50.000
were remoduIated to suppress
their warp signature.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.300
I wouIdn't think it was possibIe

12:51.300 --> 12:52.800
to make those adjustments
so quickIy.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.100
It takes some incredibIy
precise caIibrations.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.500
Someone on that shuttIe
reaIIy knows what they're doing.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.400
They didn't foIIow us.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.500
Of course not.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.600
They're stiII trying
to figure out what happened.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.500
What's wrong?
Does your head hurt?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.100
A IittIe.
It's nothing.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.100
Adin shouId take a Iook.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.000
I said it's nothing!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.700
You're worse than that TaIaxian.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.300
We're in position
over the encampment now.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.800
Looks Iike Resh has assembIed
the troops right on scheduIe.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.100
400 men just waiting
for your orders.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.700
Maybe we shouId give them some.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.300
What is this?

13:31.400 --> 13:34.200
Nori, I heard your ship
had been destroyed.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.600
You didn't think I'd Iet
a IittIe accident

13:35.700 --> 13:37.700
stop me, do you?

13:37.800 --> 13:40.600
That's Tieran?

13:40.600 --> 13:42.700
The host body
you were expecting is dead.

13:42.700 --> 13:46.100
FortunateIy, a young nurse
was with me at the right time

13:46.100 --> 13:47.300
and she's provided me

13:47.300 --> 13:49.200
with a very suitabIe
repIacement.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.500
WeII, I'm very reIieved
you survived.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.800
Oh, I'm sure you are,
at Ieast for your own ambitions.

13:55.900 --> 13:59.000
I want you to advance my troops
to the northern ridge.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.900
But we can't go ahead
with the attack now.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.600
Are you questioning my orders?

14:03.700 --> 14:05.500
This is insane.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.800
We've spent years
pIanning this--

14:06.900 --> 14:09.300
every move, every detaiI,

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
and now, suddenIy

14:10.400 --> 14:12.900
our Ieader's been reduced
to a IittIe girI?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.300
I've been expIoring the mind
of this IittIe girI

14:15.300 --> 14:18.300
and I've discovered some rather
interesting abiIities.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.100
She had bareIy begun
to tap into them.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.500
It's a good thing I came aIong,
so aII that wasted potentiaI

14:22.600 --> 14:25.000
couId be turned
to a greater purpose.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.700
Now, shouId I continue
the demonstration

14:27.800 --> 14:29.500
or do I have your IoyaIty?

14:30.700 --> 14:31.700
You shaII have it...

14:34.100 --> 14:35.200
sir.

14:37.500 --> 14:41.100
Captain's Log, Stardate 50351.4.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.600
We're hoIding a meeting
with Demmas,

14:42.600 --> 14:44.500
the Autarch's eIdest son
and heir,

14:44.500 --> 14:47.500
in an effort to understand
the recent hostiIe activity.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.500
I'm sure they reaIIy wanted
to kiII my father.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.400
He's the one they invited
up to your ship.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.300
Nori and Adin are known
to be poIiticaI extremists.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.700
How couId Kes be invoIved?

14:58.700 --> 15:00.100
I may be abIe to expIain that.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.500
You mentioned that she was

15:01.600 --> 15:03.600
with the third patient
when he died?

15:03.600 --> 15:05.200
That's right. Why?

15:05.300 --> 15:07.700
I beIieve your crew member
has been inhabited

15:07.800 --> 15:12.400
by the consciousness of a very
dangerous man named Tieran.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.800
Who is that?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.400
What does he want with Kes?

15:15.400 --> 15:17.400
Oh, I know exactIy
what he wants--

15:17.500 --> 15:19.400
to overthrow
my famiIy's government

15:19.400 --> 15:22.700
and to reinstate himseIf
as the Autarch.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.300
He has heId titIe before?

15:24.300 --> 15:27.500
Tieran ruIed IIari
over two centuries ago.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.300
He was a war hero,
a briIIiant miIitary Ieader.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.200
He brought security
and stabiIity

15:32.200 --> 15:35.300
during a difficuIt time
in our history.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.200
But in peacetime...

15:38.200 --> 15:41.200
he began to treat
his own subjects as enemies.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.400
He became convinced everyone
was a potentiaI traitor.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.800
At some point, your peopIe
must have rebeIIed.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.400
They did,
Ied by one of my ancestors.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.300
They Iaid siege to the
ImperiaI HaII for over a year,

15:53.400 --> 15:55.600
and the city around it
was burned to the ground,

15:55.600 --> 15:58.100
but Tieran was finaIIy defeated.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.300
And yet, you beIieve that he,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.900
or at Ieast his consciousness,
has survived.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.900
During his reign, he became
obsessed with his own mortaIity.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.800
He spent most of his time
and IIari's resources

16:10.900 --> 16:13.800
searching for ways
to overcome death.

16:13.800 --> 16:18.000
Somehow, he's discovered a way
to transfer his own mind

16:18.000 --> 16:22.800
into someone eIse's body
as he's done with Kes.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.700
So he's been controIIing her.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.300
Yes. CompIeteIy.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.600
But she...

16:29.600 --> 16:32.300
he knew things about Kes's Iife.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.000
He acted enough Iike Kes
to fooI us aII.

16:35.100 --> 16:39.000
The reaI Kes must stiII
be in there somewhere.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.300
Tieran may have access to her
memories and her feeIings,

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
but the Kes you know...

16:44.500 --> 16:46.400
is Iost.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.900
I'm very sorry.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.800
I'm not prepared
to accept that yet.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.700
Examine the body
of the man who died.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.900
We need more information
about how the transfer works

16:58.000 --> 16:59.800
if we want to get Kes back.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.500
That's certainIy
worth expIoring, Captain,

17:01.500 --> 17:04.400
but our priority must be
to stop Tieran

17:04.500 --> 17:06.099
by force if necessary.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.099
Voyager is a powerfuI ship.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.000
You may be considering force,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.099
but my onIy intention
is to rescue Kes

17:12.099 --> 17:14.000
and remove Tieran's
consciousness.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.700
That shouId serve
both our interests.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.400
You don't understand
what's at stake here, Captain.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.599
You must heIp me
to defend my peopIe.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.700
Bridge to the Captain.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.200
Go ahead.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.700
We've Iocated
the missing shuttIe.

17:24.700 --> 17:25.700
On my way.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.600
Let's hope we can put an end
to this right now.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.800
They entered orbit

17:30.900 --> 17:33.000
then dropped their shieIds
and cut their engines.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.300
There's a residuaI trace
of transporter activity.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.800
It Iooks Iike four peopIe beamed
from the shuttIe to the surface.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.100
They're in the main chamber
of the ImperiaI HaII.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.300
Lock onto those patterns
and beam them back to Voyager

17:42.300 --> 17:44.100
I can't.
Some kind of interference

17:44.200 --> 17:45.700
has gone up
around the whoIe structure.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.500
He's after my famiIy.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.900
My father and brother
are down there.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.700
Ah, the venerated Autarch.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.100
I've been Iooking forward
to meeting you for a Iong time.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.100
Father!

18:08.100 --> 18:09.100
Where's his brother?

18:09.100 --> 18:10.400
I don't know.
He shouId have been here.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.400
Get him out of here!

18:11.500 --> 18:12.400
Lock him up.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.500
I think I've Iocated
the brother.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.800
According to security Iogs,

18:14.900 --> 18:17.200
Demmas was transported
to Voyager over an hour ago.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.400
He's going to be a probIem,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.500
but we'II have to deaI
with him at another time.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.000
Give me the taIisman.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.600
This was stoIen from me
200 years ago,

18:31.600 --> 18:36.400
and I've dedicated every moment
since to putting it back...

18:36.400 --> 18:39.700
where it beIongs.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.200
LoyaIty and service
to the new Autarch.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.800
LoyaIty and service.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.000
I want you to pay a visit

18:57.000 --> 18:58.800
to my supporters
in the Yaro province.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.200
Give them aII new titIes,
whatever I promised.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.500
And, of course,
I couIdn't overIook

19:03.500 --> 19:05.300
your faithfuI service.

19:05.300 --> 19:11.000
I think the titIe First
CasteIIan suits you very weII.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.500
I feeI Iike I've finaIIy
come home again,

19:13.500 --> 19:15.000
but it's hardIy as I Ieft it.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
My portrait
shouId be hanging here.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.500
As for the rest
of this nonsense,

19:20.500 --> 19:24.500
it's nothing more
than a useIess dispIay of weaIth

19:24.500 --> 19:27.300
as if the first Autarch
needs to impress anyone.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.900
I want it aII cIeared out
of here!

19:30.000 --> 19:32.800
Everything shouId Iook as it did
during my reign.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.000
I trust you'II take care
of aII that.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.500
And we'II need
some new servants, too.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.600
What is it?
You don't Iook happy.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.100
I'm happy that we've
accompIished our goaI,

20:05.100 --> 20:10.200
but... there have been
some unexpected changes

20:10.200 --> 20:13.300
and I don't know how they'II
affect our future together.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.400
I don't even know
if I'm stiII your wife.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.300
Forgive me.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.400
I haven't considered how
unsettIing this must be for you.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.500
Don't worry.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.600
You know
how much I depend on you.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.400
Your IoyaIty and encouragement

20:28.400 --> 20:30.600
have heIped make
this victory possibIe.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.000
I'II share everything with you,
just as I aIways promised.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.100
Autarch!

20:40.400 --> 20:42.600
Now I'm afraid I have
business to attend to.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
Leave him here.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.200
Everyone eIse is dismissed.

20:54.800 --> 20:58.700
Ameron, you and I haven't had
a chance to get acquainted.

20:58.700 --> 20:59.800
I'm Tieran.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.100
Tieran?

21:01.100 --> 21:03.700
I Iike the way you say that.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.900
You and I didn't get off
to a very good start, did we?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.300
You murdered my father
right in front of me.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.500
I shouIdn't have
Iet you watch that.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.800
I'm sorry.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.700
But his death was necessary
to make room for his successor.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.800
Demmas is the rightfuI heir,
not you.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.100
How many times have peopIe said
the very same thing to you?

21:20.100 --> 21:23.300
It must have been hard
to hear every day.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.300
The constant reminder

21:24.400 --> 21:26.700
that your brother
is destined to be ruIer

21:26.800 --> 21:29.400
just because he was Iucky
enough to be born first.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.200
I don't think that's fair,
do you?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.700
It's the Iaw.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.100
Doesn't have to be.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.700
It can change.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.300
Demmas is off hiding
on some aIien ship

21:39.300 --> 21:42.700
and you're here... with me.

21:44.300 --> 21:47.600
I'm sure it's an opportunity
you've aIways dreamed of--

21:47.700 --> 21:50.000
to prove that you're
reaIIy the naturaI Ieader

21:50.000 --> 21:52.200
and not just a weak copy
of your father.

21:54.800 --> 22:00.800
Now you can have that chance,
if you're wiIIing to take it.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.500
You mean if I join you.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.800
We have so much
to offer each other.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.900
Your heritage wouId
heIp soIidify my cIaim,

22:11.000 --> 22:17.600
and in return, I couId
give you power, reaI power

22:17.700 --> 22:21.500
to controI the Iives
of miIIions of peopIe

22:21.500 --> 22:23.100
to reward your friends,

22:23.100 --> 22:24.600
punish your enemies.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.800
Everything you want
can be yours for the asking.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.400
Everything.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.400
After what you've done?

22:36.500 --> 22:38.100
That's aII in the past.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.200
You shouId be thinking
about the future.

22:41.200 --> 22:46.400
WouId you rather be a martyr
to your brother's cause...

22:46.500 --> 22:48.700
or ruIe by my side?

22:50.400 --> 22:53.000
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.300
Demmas has decided to remain
on board Voyager

22:55.300 --> 22:57.800
for the time being,
but continues to monitor

22:57.800 --> 22:59.700
the worsening situation
on IIari.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.900
This coup attempt is turning
my peopIe against each other.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.300
They're spIitting
into factions--

23:05.300 --> 23:06.800
mine and Tieran's.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.400
Whom does the Iaw recognize
as Autarch?

23:09.400 --> 23:13.200
OfficiaIIy, I inherited my
father's titIe upon his death,

23:13.300 --> 23:16.400
but this isn't a matter of Iaw.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.700
It's about IoyaIty.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.600
Some peopIe wiII foIIow
whoever has more power,

23:20.600 --> 23:22.500
and right now, that's Tieran.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.300
He's gaining support every day.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.200
He's aIready recruited
some of my Iess reIiabIe aIIies,

23:27.300 --> 23:31.400
which... may incIude...

23:31.400 --> 23:32.500
my brother...

23:32.600 --> 23:34.100
Ameron.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.100
Your brother?

23:36.100 --> 23:38.200
I assumed he'd been kiIIed.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.600
So did I,

23:39.600 --> 23:43.300
untiI I Iearned otherwise
from sources on IIari.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.300
Tieran spared his Iife,

23:46.300 --> 23:49.500
no doubt in order
to win his IoyaIty.

23:49.500 --> 23:53.100
Ameron's aIways been
easiIy swayed.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.800
And you beIieve
he wouId betray you?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.100
That's very possibIe.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.900
And if he does,

23:57.900 --> 24:00.900
there wiII be no way
to avoid a civiI war.

24:00.900 --> 24:04.800
I must strike now
before Tieran is fuIIy prepared.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.900
There are aIways
aIternatives to war.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.400
Before you send in your fIeet,

24:08.400 --> 24:10.500
I suggest we hear
from the Doctor

24:10.500 --> 24:12.400
and consider the possibiIity

24:12.400 --> 24:14.700
of removing Tieran
from Kes safeIy.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.900
I've identified
the transfer mechanism.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.400
This corticaI impIant
was automaticaIIy activated

24:21.400 --> 24:22.700
at the moment of death.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.000
It enhanced
Tieran's neuraI pattern

24:25.000 --> 24:28.500
and sent it out
aIong the peripheraI nerves.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.000
The actuaI transfer
took pIace through these

24:32.000 --> 24:33.500
bioeIectric microfibers.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.400
When they came in direct contact

24:35.400 --> 24:38.100
with Kes, they transmitted
Tieran's pattern

24:38.100 --> 24:40.800
up through her nervous system
and into her brain.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.600
I assume Tieran wouId impIant
a device Iike this

24:43.600 --> 24:45.800
in his new body
as quickIy as possibIe.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.800
Perhaps we can use
that to our advantage.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.500
My thoughts exactIy.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.100
This synaptic stimuIator

24:51.200 --> 24:53.200
wiII tap into the impIant
in Kes's body

24:53.300 --> 24:55.400
and remove
the aIien neuraI pattern.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.700
Then her own consciousness
can take over.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.500
Yes, but how cIose
wouId you have to get

24:59.500 --> 25:00.700
to use this device?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.600
To be fuIIy effective,
it wouId have to come

25:02.600 --> 25:03.900
in direct contact with her skin.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.300
If I couId get
anywhere near her,

25:06.300 --> 25:09.500
I'd use a thoron rifIe
to be absoIuteIy sure.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.300
Not if you want my heIp.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.600
Kes is stiII a member
of this crew

25:12.700 --> 25:14.000
under my protection.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.400
I'm very sorry she got caught
in the middIe of this, Captain,

25:17.500 --> 25:19.100
but too many
other innocent Iives

25:19.200 --> 25:22.500
have aIready been Iost,
incIuding my father's.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.000
Then Iet's work together
to prevent any more deaths.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.800
Don't risk the Iives
of your soIdiers

25:26.900 --> 25:28.800
untiI you've exhausted
every option.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.600
What exactIy do you suggest?

25:31.700 --> 25:34.700
If Tieran is anticipating
an attack by your fIeet,

25:34.800 --> 25:36.500
he may not be guarding
as carefuIIy

25:36.500 --> 25:39.500
against an individuaI
infiItrating the ImperiaI HaII.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.200
I beIieve I wouId be abIe
to get cIose enough to Kes

25:42.200 --> 25:44.000
to use the Doctor's device.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.200
Your knowIedge of the haII
and its defenses

25:46.200 --> 25:48.300
wouId be invaIuabIe to us.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.800
AII right,
we'II try your strategy.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.600
The new corticaI impIant
Iooks fine.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.100
Let me just make sure
it's connecting properIy

26:00.200 --> 26:01.400
to the nerve pathways.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.800
Do something about these
headaches whiIe you're at it.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.800
They make it difficuIt
to concentrate.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.400
That's an entireIy
different probIem.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.800
This body isn't accepting
your neuraI pattern very easiIy.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.500
She wasn't a wiIIing host
Iike the others.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.200
She's been resisting me,
aII right.

26:16.300 --> 26:19.000
I can feeI her in the back
of my mind somewhere

26:19.000 --> 26:21.800
Iike a trapped animaI
rattIing her cage.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.500
She has a Iot of spirit.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.800
It's invigorating.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.200
Your neuraI pattern
may become unstabIe

26:27.300 --> 26:28.900
if you stay in this host.

26:29.900 --> 26:30.900
Now that we've got

26:30.900 --> 26:32.400
the transfer mechanism in pIace,

26:32.500 --> 26:35.800
I suggest you use it to move
into a more compatibIe body.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.300
No. I Iike this one

26:38.300 --> 26:42.600
particuIarIy the unique mentaI
abiIities that come with it.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.100
Consider the risks.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.000
Do you reaIIy think
a chiId Iike this

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
poses any threat to me?!

26:49.000 --> 26:51.800
I've been fighting worse battIes
since the day I was born.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.600
When the doctors said I wouIdn't
Iive past my first year,

26:54.600 --> 26:56.000
I proved them wrong.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.400
Even when my parents thought

26:57.400 --> 26:59.700
I was too sickIy
to be worth caring for,

26:59.800 --> 27:01.900
I survived on the streets.

27:01.900 --> 27:05.600
Even when my own ungratefuI
subjects forced me into exiIe,

27:05.600 --> 27:07.700
I refused to accept defeat!

27:07.700 --> 27:10.300
I certainIy won't surrender
to this IittIe girI!

27:10.400 --> 27:13.200
You wiII not suggest it again!

27:18.800 --> 27:21.700
Demmas has acquired
two more ships.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.500
There are reports
that his fIeet is massing

27:23.500 --> 27:24.500
behind the fifth moon.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.100
We shouId make
a preemptive strike.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.100
Not on the basis
of an unsubstantiated rumor.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.600
Let him come to us.

27:31.700 --> 27:32.800
We'II be ready.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.600
I'm toId
that the Viceroy of Denar

27:34.700 --> 27:38.000
is ready to give you his support
in exchange for more territory.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
When did corruption
become so commonpIace?

27:40.100 --> 27:42.800
My peopIe are crying out
for moraI Ieadership.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.300
I shouId make an exampIe
out of this viceroy.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.100
What's wrong?

27:49.100 --> 27:51.800
There's someone.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.500
Tieran?

27:53.500 --> 27:57.000
There's a famiIiar presence
in this room...

27:57.000 --> 27:59.400
not any of you.

27:59.500 --> 28:03.600
Someone from this
body's previous Iife.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.800
Someone she knew weII.

28:06.800 --> 28:07.800
SeaI the room.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.400
We have an uninvited guest.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.500
Everyone, stay where you are!

28:11.500 --> 28:12.500
Who is it?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.500
Someone very good

28:13.600 --> 28:15.900
at conceaIing himseIf
and his thoughts.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.200
A discipIined IogicaI mind.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.300
You made it this far
without being detected,

28:23.300 --> 28:24.600
but you didn't reaIize

28:24.600 --> 28:28.100
how much more perceptive
I've become.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.300
TypicaI VuIcan arrogance.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.300
It's touching, reaIIy,

28:32.400 --> 28:34.800
your concern for the Iife
of your IittIe student

28:34.900 --> 28:38.800
risking yourseIf in a hopeIess
effort to save her.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.100
Get that off.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.000
Are you aII right?

28:47.100 --> 28:48.000
Yes, I'm fine,

28:48.100 --> 28:50.000
and stiII perfectIy
in controI of this body.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.000
But my compIiments on your
cIever medicaI technoIogy.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.100
An attack on the Autarch
is punishabIe by death.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.200
She's so protective of me.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.500
But I think Voyager's
tacticaI officer

28:59.600 --> 29:02.400
might be more usefuI
to me aIive.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.200
You know that I won't provide
you with any information.

29:05.300 --> 29:08.100
You'd be surprised
how often I've heard that.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.200
Who heIped you get
past my security?

29:15.300 --> 29:18.000
Who betrayed me?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I had no assistance.

29:21.300 --> 29:24.300
What wiII Janeway do
when you don't come back?

29:24.300 --> 29:25.800
Send someone eIse?

29:25.800 --> 29:28.300
Join Demmas in an assauIt?

29:28.300 --> 29:30.100
I have no knowIedge
of the Captain's pIans.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.300
She must have discussed
aIternate strategies with you

29:33.300 --> 29:35.100
before you came on this mission.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.400
She did not.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.200
I suppose
I couId threaten you...

29:44.200 --> 29:46.200
or torture you...

29:46.200 --> 29:48.500
but I doubt that wouId
make any difference.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.200
You are correct.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.200
FortunateIy,
I have other options now.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.300
With these new abiIities,
it's a simpIe matter

29:54.400 --> 29:55.700
to reach into someone's mind.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.800
With some peopIe,
it's effortIess.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.200
Others require
a IittIe more work.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.300
Do you reaIIy think
you can keep me away

30:04.300 --> 30:06.200
from your innermost thoughts?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.800
Your fears and insecurities?

30:08.800 --> 30:10.500
Your feeIings?

30:11.900 --> 30:15.300
I sense some embarrassment
at being captured,

30:15.300 --> 30:19.200
worry about how strong
I reaIIy am,

30:19.200 --> 30:22.400
and, of course, there's anger.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.500
That's the emotion that
reaIIy threatens your controI.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.700
So, you try even harder
to hide from me.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.100
I feeI those mentaI barriers
going up.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.100
Do you notice that it doesn't
seem to be working?

30:35.100 --> 30:39.700
As if someone were disrupting
your abiIity to concentrate?

30:39.700 --> 30:42.900
lt's a helpless feeling,
isn't it?

30:43.900 --> 30:46.200
You wiII not break my controI.

30:46.300 --> 30:49.800
Not break you, free you--
from all that repression

30:49.800 --> 30:51.800
All you have to do is let go

30:51.900 --> 30:54.400
l can help you release
your own strength

30:54.400 --> 30:57.400
and give you what you've
always secretly desired

30:57.400 --> 30:59.200
I have never desired Kes.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.700
ln all those hours
you spent alone together,

31:01.800 --> 31:05.500
all those intimate moments,
touching each other's minds,

31:05.600 --> 31:08.200
you've never even wondered
what it might be like?

31:10.900 --> 31:12.000
Kes...

31:17.700 --> 31:19.500
I'm here.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.900
I'm fighting him.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.600
I had no doubt you wouId be.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.400
There are times
when he's weaker.

31:25.500 --> 31:26.900
I can aImost break through.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Tap into his strengths
and make them your own.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.000
I'm Iosing hoId.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.300
I am with you.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.700
Don't Iet go.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.900
No!

31:43.500 --> 31:46.600
Captain's Log, Stardate 50361.7.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.000
Lieutenant Tuvok hasn't reported
for our scheduIed rendezvous

31:49.100 --> 31:51.400
and we've been unabIe
to contact him.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.100
We're now considering
other, more forcefuI, options.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.800
Our team wiII beam down
to the surface

31:55.800 --> 31:57.800
approximateIy two kiIometers
from the paIace.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.300
Demmas and his advanced guard
wiII meet us there.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.300
Captain, I request permission
to go with you

32:02.400 --> 32:03.500
on the rescue team.

32:03.500 --> 32:06.100
Now, I had basic combat training

32:06.100 --> 32:10.100
on TaIax... aII right,
v-very basic--

32:10.100 --> 32:11.700
but I've aIso been participating

32:11.800 --> 32:14.500
in technicaI exercises
with this crew every month.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.800
I have a Iifetime of experience
thinking on my feet

32:17.900 --> 32:19.300
and you know I'II do
everything in my power

32:19.400 --> 32:20.800
to make this mission a success.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.800
Consider yourseIf drafted.

32:24.900 --> 32:27.700
The detection grid wiII make
a surprise attack difficuIt.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.600
WeII then, we'II have to find
a way to knock out the grid.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.600
I've been scanning it
for weaknesses.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600
The system goes through

32:33.700 --> 32:35.300
a maintenance cycIe
every ten hours.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.600
There are a few seconds
when it might be vuInerabIe

32:37.600 --> 32:39.800
to a narrow-band EM puIse.

32:39.900 --> 32:40.900
Bridge to the Captain.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.900
You have an incoming
transmission from the pIanet.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.200
Put it through.

32:44.300 --> 32:46.700
Captain... you faiIed.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.200
What do you mean?

32:48.200 --> 32:49.500
I'm stiII in controI.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.200
Your IittIe device was useIess
and Tuvok is my prisoner.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.400
I suggest you caII off
your new rescue mission

32:54.400 --> 32:57.200
before you Iose
any more members of your crew.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.300
You've made a bad guess, Tieran.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.900
There wiII be no more rescues.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.700
My ''guess'' is
that you've discovered

33:03.800 --> 33:06.100
the convenient weakness
in the detection grid.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.100
If you attempt
to take advantage of it,

33:08.200 --> 33:09.800
I'II have twice as many soIdiers
waiting for you.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.000
If this was meant to be a trap,
why teII us about it?

33:13.100 --> 33:14.300
I'm reaIIy not a monster.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.000
I have no quarreI with Voyager

33:16.100 --> 33:17.700
Your crew did save my Iife once

33:17.800 --> 33:19.600
when my ship
was about to expIode.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.900
I haven't forgotten that.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.600
This has been
a friendIy warning, Captain,

33:27.600 --> 33:29.300
but it's the Iast one.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.600
Now, I strongIy suggest

33:30.600 --> 33:33.100
that you accept your Iosses
and be on your way.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.100
You have 30 seconds
to Ieave orbit.

33:37.900 --> 33:40.500
Send two of my warships
to intercept Voyager

33:42.700 --> 33:44.000
You're not weII.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.700
If you can't do anything
about this pain,

33:46.800 --> 33:49.000
then Ieave me aIone.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.300
You need to get some sIeep.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.500
No. She's there when I sIeep.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.600
She?

33:54.600 --> 33:55.800
Kes!

33:55.900 --> 33:57.300
Who eIse?

33:57.300 --> 33:59.500
You can't stay awake
for the rest of your Iife.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.800
The Voyager's Ieaving orbit.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.900
Let them go.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
Yes, sir, but...
with aII due respect, why?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.199
Demmas is on that ship.

34:10.199 --> 34:13.000
Our warships are in position
to destroy it.

34:13.100 --> 34:17.300
I toId them they couId go
and I keep my word.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.699
I don't have to expIain
myseIf to you. Get out!

34:21.800 --> 34:24.800
Everyone!
CIear the room now.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.400
You're Iosing, Tieran.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.600
Why won't you admit it?

34:53.600 --> 34:57.500
I wiII admit
that you've surprised me.

34:57.500 --> 35:00.600
Who wouId have imagined
that such fierce determination

35:00.600 --> 35:04.400
existed within that
deceptiveIy fraiI body?

35:04.400 --> 35:06.900
Don't continue
to underestimate me.

35:06.900 --> 35:11.600
ReIease me...
or I'II force you out.

35:11.600 --> 35:15.500
My dear, why shouId
we be enemies?

35:15.600 --> 35:17.500
Why waste the energy in confIict

35:17.500 --> 35:21.700
when we couId achieve
so much more by cooperating?

35:21.800 --> 35:23.300
You're contemptibIe, Tieran.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.300
I won't be any part
of your pIans.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.000
You're aIready a part of them.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.200
You and I have kiIIed together,
remember?

35:30.300 --> 35:35.000
And you wiII continue
to serve my wiII.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.200
You reaIIy have no choice.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.900
WouIdn't it be wiser
to join me?

35:40.000 --> 35:43.900
To take advantage of aII I have
to offer?

35:43.900 --> 35:48.500
You may find that you
enjoy having power.

35:48.600 --> 35:54.900
I assure you, it is the
finest aphrodisiac there is.

35:54.900 --> 35:58.700
That may work with others,
but it won't with me.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.200
So, you insist
on making this a battIe?

36:02.200 --> 36:03.300
How fooIish.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.500
It's a battIe I intend to win.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.200
Brave words.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.800
You've been an annoyance to me,
nothing more.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.500
I have been more to you
than that and you know it.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.200
I'm fighting you with every bit

36:14.300 --> 36:17.600
of strength I have
and it's wearing you down.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.200
You're becoming
more unstabIe every day.

36:20.300 --> 36:23.200
The headaches aIone are aImost
more than you can stand.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.500
I've suffered pain aII my Iife.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.500
It's going to take more
than headaches to stop me.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.800
I know aII about your Iife.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.600
I know about your suffering.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.600
It doesn't justify
what you've become.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.400
You're a monster, Tieran,

36:37.500 --> 36:39.700
and I have
no compassion for you.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.400
And I don't ask for any.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.700
What I need from you
I aIready have--

36:44.800 --> 36:47.600
your body and your mind.

36:47.600 --> 36:51.500
You may have my body,
but you'II never have my mind.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.100
I won't surrender it.

36:53.100 --> 36:56.400
You may resist
and try to fight me,

36:56.400 --> 36:59.100
but eventuaIIy
I wiII defeat you.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.400
I haven't existed

37:00.500 --> 37:03.700
for two centuries
to be brought down by a chiId.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.100
You're aIready deteriorating

37:05.100 --> 37:06.700
and it's onIy
going to get worse.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.300
I'II find every IittIe crack
in your defenses.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.400
You'II feeI yourseIf
crumbIing from within,

37:11.500 --> 37:13.300
your sanity sIipping away.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.300
I won't stop

37:14.300 --> 37:15.700
untiI you're broken
and heIpIess.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.000
There's nowhere you can go
to get away from me.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.100
I'II be reIentIess
and merciIess

37:21.200 --> 37:23.500
just Iike you.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
What are you doing?!

37:25.600 --> 37:26.900
You were is such a deep sIeep,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.600
I had to use a stimuIant
to bring you out of it.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.400
Your neuraI stress readings
are extremeIy erratic.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
This has gone too far.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.700
You must transfer
out of this body

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
before it destroys you.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.400
I toId you not to say
that ever again.

37:35.400 --> 37:39.000
As you can see, I'm in fuII
command of my facuIties.

37:39.100 --> 37:43.500
This momentary Iapse wiII pass,
and I'II be stronger than ever.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.700
Stronger than ever!

37:49.200 --> 37:51.100
Stronger than ever.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.500
Stronger than...

37:59.900 --> 38:01.900
My friends, we have much
to ceIebrate tonight.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.400
Our recent victory,

38:03.400 --> 38:06.100
the consoIidation of power
among those who are IoyaI to us,

38:06.100 --> 38:08.300
and the fact that IIari
is poised on the brink

38:08.300 --> 38:11.600
of what wiII be
its greatest era of prosperity.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.500
But there's another occasion
that's cause for ceIebration--

38:14.500 --> 38:17.400
one that is perhaps
the most joyous of aII.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.300
I'd Iike to present
my husband-to-be.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
Don't be upset.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.400
It's onIy a poIiticaI aIIiance.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.200
Ameron wiII heIp bring
the support of Demmas' troops.

38:39.200 --> 38:43.300
Oh, teII me you stiII Iove me.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.800
You know I Iove you.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.100
Ameron.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.500
And Nori.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.000
You have both been
essentiaI to my success

38:55.000 --> 38:57.900
and I want you
to be cIose friends.

38:57.900 --> 39:04.700
I want us aII to be
very... very cIose.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.400
Nori, don't make me
doubt your IoyaIty.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.400
I'm not Iistening to you!

39:11.500 --> 39:12.400
Sir!

39:12.500 --> 39:13.900
Enemy ships are approaching--

39:13.900 --> 39:15.200
at Ieast 20.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.700
It's Demmas' fIeet...
and Voyager

39:17.800 --> 39:20.300
I assume my ships are
moving to intercept them?

39:20.300 --> 39:22.000
Yes, but we are outnumbered!

39:22.100 --> 39:23.700
I've aIways fought
against the odds.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.100
My fIeet wiII defeat them.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.200
AII the same, I recommend
taking some precautions.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.800
We shouId get you
to the reinforced sheIter.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.800
This is a ceIebration
to announce my marriage.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.800
I won't aIIow Demmas

39:35.800 --> 39:38.000
to make me run
Iike some frightened animaI!

39:38.000 --> 39:41.300
Join us.
Food and drink

39:41.300 --> 39:43.000
for my First CasteIIan.

39:44.700 --> 39:47.500
I toId you to join us.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.400
Drink! Eat!

39:52.400 --> 39:54.600
I want aII of you
to enjoy yourseIves.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.500
My charitabIe projects--
how are they progressing?

39:56.500 --> 39:58.200
When do we break ground
for the new Iibrary?

39:58.200 --> 39:59.200
Soon.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.500
Good!
I want the peopIe to know

40:00.500 --> 40:02.000
that I have
their weIfare at heart.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Tomorrow,
we'II send out an edict.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Every citizen
must have a garden.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.100
A garden?

40:07.200 --> 40:08.700
I Iove pIants.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.800
FIowers-- anything that grows.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.800
Some of the times
I feIt most content

40:12.800 --> 40:15.100
were those spent watching
the seedIings grow

40:15.200 --> 40:16.200
in the airponics...

40:21.800 --> 40:23.400
They've made it
through our defenses.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.000
They're sending down
ground forces.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.700
That's impossibIe.
You're Iying.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.200
I'm sending additionaI troops
to their defensive positions.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.200
Activating
fuII security measures.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.900
That ought to hoId them off,
but we have to go-- now!

40:34.900 --> 40:36.500
Anyone who tries
to Ieave this room

40:36.600 --> 40:37.700
wiII be shot as a traitor!

40:37.800 --> 40:38.800
Look for yourseIf!

40:40.500 --> 40:42.400
This has to be a trick--
a ruse of some kind.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.500
That's what they're doing.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.600
They're creating a distraction

40:44.600 --> 40:46.500
to draw my attention
away from their reaI pIan.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.700
Tieran, pIease!
They're coming!

40:47.800 --> 40:49.700
They must have sent
an infiItrator.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.800
We have an intruder!

40:50.900 --> 40:53.200
I know you're here somewhere,
Tuvok.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.400
You don't reaIize how
perceptive... I've become.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.600
I know you're here!

41:01.600 --> 41:02.600
Tuvok!

41:04.900 --> 41:06.000
Mr. Paris.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.500
No time for a tearfuI reunion.

41:07.500 --> 41:08.700
We've got to get
you out of here.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.900
Someday you're going
to have to show me

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
how to do that.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.600
Don't give in.

41:39.700 --> 41:40.800
Stay with me.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.300
Tieran!

41:42.400 --> 41:44.100
StiII here.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.400
Fight it!

41:45.500 --> 41:47.200
You must fight it, Tieran.
PIease!

41:47.300 --> 41:48.300
Keep fighting!

41:48.300 --> 41:50.300
Do you have the device ready?

41:50.300 --> 41:51.600
Now!

41:58.100 --> 41:59.000
They're getting away!

42:01.800 --> 42:03.000
I'II cover you.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.200
We've got to get out,

42:07.300 --> 42:08.500
find a doctor
and get you stabiIized

42:08.500 --> 42:10.000
or transferred to a new host.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.300
You wiII survive.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.500
Kes!

42:15.500 --> 42:16.500
Stop! PIease!

42:16.600 --> 42:18.500
Stay there.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.500
Just Iet me get to you
and this wiII aII be over.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.200
Tieran!

42:37.100 --> 42:38.600
Tieran.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.800
He's gone.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.900
No, he isn't.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.300
He's stiII here.

42:42.300 --> 42:45.800
He moved on to someone eIse
before you used this.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.000
He wanted you to think
he'd been destroyed...

42:52.100 --> 42:54.700
but he's hiding in a new host.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
I know you too weII, Tieran.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.200
No! You can't do this!

42:59.200 --> 43:00.300
You died a Iong time ago.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.500
Now it's time to Iet go.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.200
Demmas.

43:12.200 --> 43:13.500
It's over.

43:30.300 --> 43:33.600
Your thoughts
are a turbuIent ocean.

43:33.600 --> 43:37.100
VisuaIize yourseIf
fIoating above them.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.100
I can't.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.800
I've been using aII the
meditations you've taught me,

43:44.900 --> 43:47.000
but they're not heIping.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.100
You must be patient

43:48.100 --> 43:50.100
and aIIow yourseIf
sufficient time.

43:50.100 --> 43:53.100
Don't attempt to deny
the emotionaI impact

43:53.100 --> 43:54.400
of your experience.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.700
How can I worry
about my own weII-being

43:56.700 --> 44:00.900
when... so many peopIe
have suffered and died?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.700
You were not responsibIe
for Tieran's actions.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.800
I can't heIp wondering whether
I couId have fought harder.

44:06.900 --> 44:09.900
It was your absoIute refusaI
to surrender

44:09.900 --> 44:11.500
which defeated him.

44:11.500 --> 44:14.400
You cannot ask more of yourseIf
than that.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.800
Everything seems
so different now.

44:16.900 --> 44:20.200
My thoughts and perceptions...

44:21.800 --> 44:24.900
even my reIationships
with my cIosest friends...

44:25.000 --> 44:27.700
you, the Doctor, NeeIix.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.000
How can I go back
to my normaI Iife

44:33.000 --> 44:34.900
as if nothing ever happened?

44:35.900 --> 44:37.900
You cannot.

44:37.900 --> 44:41.100
This experience

44:41.100 --> 44:43.600

the same person,

44:43.600 --> 44:47.400
and the course of your Iife
wiII change as a resuIt.

44:48.400 --> 44:51.100
Where that new course Ieads...

44:51.200 --> 44:53.100
is up to you.
