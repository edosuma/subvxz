00:00.001 --> 00:03.268
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart--

00:03.270 --> 00:04.837
[elizabeth]: <i>I spend so much</i>
<i>time focused on my future,</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:06.939
<i>I lose sight</i>
<i>of the most important things.</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:09.308
Good to see you.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.642
[jack]: <i>He's a good man.</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:11.877
[elizabeth]: <i>And apparently</i>
<i>sweet on rosemary.</i>

00:11.879 --> 00:13.012
Nora--

00:13.014 --> 00:14.713
I understand that
my leaving upset you,

00:14.715 --> 00:16.348
And I think we can try again.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.183
[jack]:
Welcome home.

00:19.219 --> 00:22.021
[â™ª]

00:38.905 --> 00:40.973
[â™ª]

00:47.313 --> 00:49.548
Excuse me, miss?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.450
Can you tell me
what this is used for?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.386
You don't know
what that is?

00:54.388 --> 00:57.256
Well, I've seen it
around the kitchen.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.925
It's a rolling pin.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.393
You use it for baking.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.062
Ah.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.496
Do you bake?

01:04.498 --> 01:05.564
Oh, I'm afraid

01:05.566 --> 01:06.698
I'm better
at burning things

01:06.700 --> 01:08.901
Than baking them.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.169
Do you think
it would make a nice gift

01:10.171 --> 01:11.103
For my mother's birthday?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.273
Well...

01:14.275 --> 01:17.476
I think women prefer
something more personal.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.547
Like perfume,
or soap for the bath--

01:21.549 --> 01:22.548
Things like that.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.583
Oh. I see.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.688
I don't believe
I've seen you before.

01:29.690 --> 01:33.392
I haven't been in
hope valley very long.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.526
I'm from hamilton.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.429
Oh. City girl?

01:37.431 --> 01:39.098
Always wanted to
live in a big city.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.632
I didn't
care for it much.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.034
We just arrived
a few weeks ago,

01:42.036 --> 01:43.602
From rock creek.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.771
It's a nice town,
but small.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.673
Smaller
than hope valley.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.146
Are you
following me?

01:55.315 --> 01:57.049
Yes. [laughs]

01:57.051 --> 01:58.684
I am.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.387
Well, I'm...
Going over there next.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.491
Okay.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.527
How do you like
living here?

02:09.896 --> 02:12.264
I like it. Very much.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.466
May I ask your name?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.235
Clara.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.337
Clara stanton.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.139
Luke mccoy.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.040
It's a pleasure to meet
you, clara stanton.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.843
May I ask you
something else?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.882
All right.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.153
[â™ª]

02:45.532 --> 02:46.832
Bill.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.369
Thought
that was your horse outside.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.703
Welcome back.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.971
Just got into town
a little while ago.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.274
I got an alert yesterday,

02:55.276 --> 02:56.475
Said there might be
some counterfeiters

02:56.477 --> 02:57.809
Working this territory.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.278
That what brings you out here?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.547
Well, I'm always
on the trail of something, jack.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.015
Mm.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.516
How's clara?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.785
She seems to be adjusting.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.254
Has abigail
mentioned me at all?

03:10.456 --> 03:12.124
No, that's okay.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.292
I don't mean
to put you on the spot.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.327
I'm sure the whole town's
heard about nora by now.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.762
You don't owe me
an explanation.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.298
You, uh, you have
a description

03:19.300 --> 03:20.365
Of these counterfeiters?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.967
Might help me
keep an eye out for them.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.135
No, I don't.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.169
Doubt they'd be working

03:24.171 --> 03:25.837
A small town
like hope valley anyway.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.872
Well, actually,
the alert said

03:26.874 --> 03:27.873
They were working
their way west.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.308
You must be
keeping pretty busy,

03:29.310 --> 03:30.709
Given how this town's
growing so fast.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.477
Yep.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.046
It's got its challenges.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.083
Well, don't let me
get in your way, jack.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.419
[â™ª]

03:48.361 --> 03:50.062
[elizabeth]: And how is clara
doing with her sewing?

03:50.064 --> 03:51.930
Oh! Busy.
People have seen

03:51.932 --> 03:53.432
The apron that
she made for me

03:53.434 --> 03:55.367
And the word is out!

03:55.369 --> 03:57.703
Women are asking
for alterations.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.937
One woman asked her

03:58.939 --> 04:00.706
If she could design
a dress for her.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.507
That's marvelous.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.942
She's so talented.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.577
Oh, I'm hoping,
if she can get enough work,

04:05.579 --> 04:08.013
She can open a little store
here in town.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.081
[door opens]

04:12.452 --> 04:13.752
Clara?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.087
Oh.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.788
Abigail.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.123
Hello, elizabeth.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.092
-Hi.
-Is everything all right?

04:20.094 --> 04:22.361
Well...

04:22.363 --> 04:25.030
There was this man
at the mercantile...

04:25.032 --> 04:26.365
And...?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.866
And...

04:27.868 --> 04:30.302
He asked me to go to
the ice cream social with him.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.741
I see.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.142
Clara!
That's wonderful.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.443
Who is he?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.545
His name is luke mccoy.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.747
And...?

04:41.749 --> 04:43.382
And he's quite nice.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.549
And...?

04:45.718 --> 04:47.953
And handsome.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.254
[elizabeth laughs]

04:49.256 --> 04:50.956
Is there a problem?

04:50.958 --> 04:53.492
Well, I told him
I was a widow,

04:53.494 --> 04:55.661
But it didn't seem
to matter to him.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.130
Well...

04:58.132 --> 05:00.098
What did you say
about the social?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.500
I told him no.

05:15.581 --> 05:18.050
[â™ª]

05:40.673 --> 05:43.675
Okay, it's this parcel...
Right here.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.844
This'll give us
the inventory we need

05:45.846 --> 05:48.213
To handle
our current contracts.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.282
Oh, and I need you
to file that application

05:50.284 --> 05:52.351
With the forest services
department in union city

05:52.353 --> 05:54.720
As soon as you can, all right?
Thank you.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.391
Lee.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.959
I have to read you something.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.894
Um... Is this
gonna take long,

06:02.896 --> 06:04.129
Or can I sit?

06:04.131 --> 06:06.565
Sit, stand--
it makes no difference to me.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.135
"louise grant gives
a <i>stunning</i> performance

06:10.137 --> 06:13.705
As princess marie
in   <i>the pride of jennico."</i>

06:16.476 --> 06:18.043
I can't believe that!

06:18.045 --> 06:19.978
I can't believe it either.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.680
Why can't we believe that?

06:21.682 --> 06:23.815
I know that woman.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.151
And she is a terrible actress!

06:26.153 --> 06:29.488
I played princess marie
myself once, and...

06:29.490 --> 06:30.655
[stomps foot]

06:30.657 --> 06:32.724
Well, I was terrific.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.026
Why do I have a feeling
there's a reason

06:35.028 --> 06:37.162
You felt compelled to
come in here and tell me this?

06:39.031 --> 06:41.233
I miss the theater, lee.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.667
Ahh...

06:42.669 --> 06:43.668
The costumes...

06:43.670 --> 06:45.237
The applause,

06:45.239 --> 06:46.438
The opening night excitement.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.439
The adulation?

06:47.441 --> 06:48.940
Well...

06:48.942 --> 06:51.576
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't love all the attention.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.678
Mm-hmm.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.447
But seriously...

06:55.449 --> 06:57.249
Now that the sawmill
is up and running,

06:57.251 --> 06:59.584
And there's new folks
coming into hope valley,

06:59.586 --> 07:03.021
Don't you think it's time
this town got a theater?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.257
Rosemary, it's a little more
complicated than that.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.691
You don't believe
I'm good enough

07:06.693 --> 07:07.692
To run a theater.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.394
Do you?

07:09.396 --> 07:10.395
No! That not it at all.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.463
Yes, it is.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.598
And I am a wonderful actress...

07:13.600 --> 07:16.435
[theatrically]
...Who can <i>fill</i> a house!

07:16.437 --> 07:18.437
But you probably
don't believe that either.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.739
Rosemary, it's not that either.
All right?

07:20.741 --> 07:23.041
Look, this is just a very
critical time at the mill,

07:23.043 --> 07:25.610
What with this new contract
and everything.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.248
[door slams]

07:30.250 --> 07:31.750
That woman could give
a pack of wild horses

07:31.752 --> 07:33.552
A run for their money.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.655
[birds singing]

07:38.791 --> 07:41.827
She's been quite distracted
since it happened,

07:41.829 --> 07:43.295
And she...

07:43.297 --> 07:46.465
She's really not open
to speaking much about it.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.799
Do you think
she's concerned

07:47.801 --> 07:50.435
About honoring
your son's memory?

07:50.437 --> 07:52.637
I think
that's a possibility,

07:52.639 --> 07:54.105
And...

07:54.107 --> 07:55.574
Well, I feel like

07:55.576 --> 07:56.908
I want to be there
to help her,

07:56.910 --> 07:59.144
But I don't know how to
get her to talk about it.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.079
What's your take
on the subject?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.415
If I were being honest...

08:03.417 --> 08:04.850
I'm a little conflicted.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.018
How so?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.754
I want to be happy for her.

08:09.756 --> 08:10.989
She's young

08:10.991 --> 08:12.123
And she has
her whole life

08:12.125 --> 08:13.258
Ahead of her,

08:13.260 --> 08:16.061
But I... [sighs]

08:18.130 --> 08:19.831
You've never had a daughter,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.868
Have you?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.035
No.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.309
You think
it's possible

08:31.311 --> 08:33.745
You're being
a little protective?

08:34.814 --> 08:36.781
I suppose I am.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.519
You don't think there's anything
wrong with that, do you?

08:40.521 --> 08:43.188
No. No, I think
it's completely normal.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.056
I mean,
she just got here

08:45.058 --> 08:47.893
And you're enjoying
having her around,

08:47.895 --> 08:50.328
And now you're afraid
you may lose her.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.631
How perceptive of you.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.767
Do you think I'm being selfish?

08:57.403 --> 09:00.038
I've never been one
to judge people's feelings.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.240
But, you know,
I-I don't think

09:02.242 --> 09:04.009
That the memory of your son

09:04.011 --> 09:06.511
Is what's causing
her conflict.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.713
I think that...

09:08.715 --> 09:11.750
What she's concerned with
is hurting you.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.954
I hadn't thought of that.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.090
She is a very sensitive girl.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.258
In my experience,

09:20.260 --> 09:22.060
I've learned
there are two things

09:22.062 --> 09:24.696
You cannot have
any influence over--

09:24.698 --> 09:26.798
Young love
and mules.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.068
So my advice to you
is let her know

09:30.070 --> 09:32.370
That you're okay
with her dating,

09:32.372 --> 09:34.172
Back off...

09:34.174 --> 09:35.840
And hope for the best.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.411
I would say
"have a little faith,"

09:39.413 --> 09:43.548
But... Well, that sounds like
something a preacher would say.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.517
[both chuckling]

09:47.119 --> 09:49.054
Thank you,
pastor frank.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.556
Just call me frank.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.425
Oh, I'm not sure
that's appropriate.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.694
After all,
you are our pastor.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.930
There's no difference
between you and I, abigail.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.467
We are all the same
in the eyes of god.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.369
And people that call me "pastor"

10:04.371 --> 10:06.071
Are just putting up
an invisible wall

10:06.073 --> 10:08.239
That keeps me from my flock,

10:08.241 --> 10:11.276
And I sure don't want that.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.445
Well, all right, then.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.048
Thank you for the advice...
Frank.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.117
[chuckles] better.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.685
Good day.

10:42.341 --> 10:45.577
[shuts the door]

10:45.579 --> 10:48.413
Mr. Avery, I'm quite busy,
so if you'll excuse me.

10:49.849 --> 10:50.982
Abigail--

10:50.984 --> 10:52.784
You have some nerve
coming here.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.620
I'm only in town
on business.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.689
And before someone else
said something to you,

10:57.691 --> 10:59.457
I thought I should
tell you myself.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.192
Well...

11:01.194 --> 11:03.094
Now that you have,
you can be on your way.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.597
How's clara?

11:06.766 --> 11:08.166
She's doing just fine.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.567
How's nora, your wife?

11:11.604 --> 11:12.671
Mr. Avery.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.139
Clara.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.874
How nice to see you.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.642
Abigail tells me

11:17.644 --> 11:19.477
That you're settling in
here in hope valley.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.980
Well, it's had
its ups and downs,

11:21.982 --> 11:23.715
But everyone
has been very supportive.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.316
Especially abigail.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.552
She's wonderful,
isn't she?

11:29.622 --> 11:30.522
Will you be staying long?

11:30.524 --> 11:31.623
No.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.625
He's just here
on business.

11:33.627 --> 11:36.294
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.964
I do hope we get the chance
to see you again before you go.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.099
So do I.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.212
He's such a nice man.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.917
[sighs]

12:05.758 --> 12:08.593
[quiet exchange]

12:19.505 --> 12:21.573
Bill.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.342
Our banker
just handed me this note.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.277
Says it's
counterfeit.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.215
He's right.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.549
Did he get
a description

12:31.551 --> 12:33.051
Of the man who passed it?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.953
He said it was a busy time.
The teller didn't remember.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.521
I'm gonna go alert
the other merchants.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.722
No, no.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.190
I'll handle this.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.693
It's best you focus on
your duties here in town.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.029
Bill...

12:45.031 --> 12:47.532
I'm getting the distinct feeling
you have some issue with me.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.934
I really don't, jack.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.936
But if you keep badgering me,
I will.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.707
[â™ª]

13:01.547 --> 13:04.315
[hearty chuckling]

13:05.618 --> 13:08.052
Do you think
you can do it for me, hickam?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.921
Well, um,
miss rosemary...

13:09.923 --> 13:12.791
I know it's asking a lot,
but...

13:12.793 --> 13:15.093
Well, it's just this one favor.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.394
It's not
that I don't want to--

13:16.396 --> 13:18.630
It would mean
a great deal to me.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.899
Well, I--
I can do it--

13:20.901 --> 13:22.934
Oh! Wonderful!

13:22.936 --> 13:24.969
But I don't want lee
to find out.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.104
Yeah, me neither.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.005
Considering
what you're asking,

13:27.007 --> 13:28.406
I don't know

13:28.408 --> 13:29.974
If it'll make mr. Coulter
so angry he'll fire me.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.009
[laughing]

13:31.011 --> 13:32.811
No! He won't fire you.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.013
I won't let him.
That's a promise.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.481
So...

13:36.483 --> 13:38.683
Do we have a deal?

13:40.419 --> 13:42.020
Miss rosemary,

13:42.022 --> 13:44.823
You are one hard
woman to say no to.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.024
[laughs]

13:46.026 --> 13:47.425
How true.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.762
[lee]: What do you suppose
that was all about?

13:50.764 --> 13:52.096
With rosemary,

13:52.098 --> 13:53.665
Anything could be going
through that head of hers.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.000
I swear, that woman
is a puzzle to me.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.435
Never know from
one moment to the next

13:57.437 --> 13:58.937
What's going to come
flying out of her mouth.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.339
This morning, she told me
what a great actress she was.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.340
You ever seen her act?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.775
-Yeah.
-Oh, you have?

14:03.777 --> 14:05.176
I wouldn't be surprised
if sooner or later

14:05.178 --> 14:06.678
She asks you
to build her a theater.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.313
She did! This morning.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.948
-No!
-She did, yes!

14:09.950 --> 14:11.149
I'll tell you
one thing.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.818
Once that woman gets
an idea in her head,

14:13.820 --> 14:17.088
She is like a dog
on a down-wind scent.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.728
Hyah!

14:27.132 --> 14:28.132
Excuse me.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.133
Of course.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.981
[â™ª]

14:54.393 --> 14:56.561
Are you sure
this is all right?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.429
As long as we're back
before father gets home.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.431
This is gonna
be so exciting!

15:00.433 --> 15:02.400
You have the key?

15:04.436 --> 15:07.505
Don't be so quick
with those hands.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.683
Been a pleasure
talking to you.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.089
Excuse me, ladies.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.226
Do either of you know where
I might find elizabeth thatcher?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.128
Just down here?
Thank you.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.609
So, have you made
a decision about luke?

15:45.878 --> 15:47.779
I'm just so confused.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.382
Are you afraid you would
be dishonoring peter

15:51.384 --> 15:53.451
By accepting
his invitation?

15:54.887 --> 15:56.254
Well...

15:56.256 --> 15:58.222
I loved peter
very much.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.525
Oh...
I know you did.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.697
I went through
the same thing, clara.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.435
Have you ever...

16:10.437 --> 16:12.870
Opened my heart
to another man?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.841
Yes. I did.

16:16.843 --> 16:17.809
Didn't you feel...

16:17.811 --> 16:19.577
Guilty?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.681
No.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.650
Because I realized,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.785
If the situation
had been different,

16:27.787 --> 16:29.988
And noah had lost me,

16:29.990 --> 16:31.589
I wouldn't have wanted him

16:31.591 --> 16:34.025
To spend
the rest of his life alone,

16:34.027 --> 16:36.294
Because, when
you truly love someone,

16:36.296 --> 16:38.997
All you want
is for them to be happy.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.267
I know peter truly loved me.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.870
And I know peter
would not have wanted you

16:45.872 --> 16:47.605
To spend
the rest of your life alone.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.843
Are you saying
it would be all right with you

16:51.845 --> 16:52.777
If I went to that social?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.947
Is that
what's troubling you most?

16:57.216 --> 16:59.450
Abigail...

16:59.452 --> 17:01.185
You have been
like a mother to me,

17:01.187 --> 17:02.620
And the last thing
I'd want to do

17:02.622 --> 17:04.789
Is to hurt you.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.225
Clara, you are
a very thoughtful young woman,

17:07.227 --> 17:10.795
And I appreciate
you considering my feelings,

17:10.797 --> 17:13.398
But if you want to accept
that invitation from luke,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.133
It is fine with me.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.701
[relieved chuckle]

17:22.508 --> 17:23.741
[door opens]

17:23.743 --> 17:24.876
Working overtime?

17:29.148 --> 17:31.182
Charles!

17:31.184 --> 17:32.216
[sighs]

17:33.585 --> 17:36.020
Why didn't you let me
know you were coming?

17:36.022 --> 17:38.322
Well, I know how fond
you are of surprises, so.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.557
I am not fond

17:39.559 --> 17:41.192
Of someone
suddenly showing up

17:41.194 --> 17:42.360
On my doorstep
unannounced.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.328
Even you.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.067
I must look a fright.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.402
You look lovely, as always.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.604
Lovely?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.073
After a day of
teaching 20 children,

17:55.075 --> 17:56.407
All needing my attention,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.943
And now laden down
with a stack of books?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.945
May I carry
teacher's books?

18:00.947 --> 18:03.347
Teacher is just fine
carrying her own books.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.449
Of course. I forgot.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.184
This is elizabeth thatcher
frontier woman.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.119
Totally self-sufficient.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.189
All right.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.690
You may
carry my books.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.192
Thank you.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.226
But if you think you're going
to get a better grade...

18:15.228 --> 18:17.295
Of course not.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.464
I'm fully prepared
to work hard to earn that "a."

18:19.466 --> 18:21.265
[sighs heavily]

18:34.613 --> 18:36.881
It's my father's
pride and joy.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.316
Well, after
his daughters, of course.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.885
I can see why.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.954
I like danger,

18:42.956 --> 18:44.322
But we're skirting
awfully close

18:44.324 --> 18:45.389
To the flame,

18:45.391 --> 18:47.225
Taking this baby out.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.259
Well, what's
the matter?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.595
Losing your nerve?

18:50.597 --> 18:51.629
Heck, no!

18:51.631 --> 18:53.131
I just...

18:53.133 --> 18:55.900
I've never driven
a car like this before.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.402
Especially without
the owner's permission.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.738
Since when
did you ever need permission?

19:00.740 --> 19:02.673
For anything?

19:07.913 --> 19:10.414
Julie, I think
you're a bad influence on me.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.116
I think you love it.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.651
Shall we?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.357
Let's.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.637
Charles...
Why did you do this?

19:32.639 --> 19:35.540
Do what?

19:35.542 --> 19:38.376
Come all the way
out here just to see me?

19:38.378 --> 19:40.311
It will only make
things very awkward.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.180
Elizabeth...

19:42.182 --> 19:43.681
You know I would
never do anything

19:43.683 --> 19:45.683
That'd make you
feel uncomfortable.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.885
I came out here
on business.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.687
Honestly, charles.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.556
What business
could my father's company

19:51.558 --> 19:53.391
Possibly have
in hope valley?

19:53.393 --> 19:54.559
Charlie?

19:56.228 --> 19:58.062
Charlie kensington?

19:58.064 --> 19:59.163
Leland coulter?

19:59.165 --> 20:00.398
[chuckles]
figured that was you.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.500
City-slickers stick out
like a sore thumb.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.568
Good to finally meet you.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.236
-Likewise.
-You two know each other?

20:05.238 --> 20:06.637
Sure! Charlie works
for hamilton shipping.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.139
I know that.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.807
He's their
top sales representative.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.143
Yes, I know that, too.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.411
Okay, well, did you
happen to know

20:13.413 --> 20:15.413
That they're one of
my first big contracts?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.081
Yeah, charlie and I have
been sending telegrams

20:17.083 --> 20:19.984
Back and forth for...
Quite a while.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.485
Yeah, they ordered
a whole load of lumber

20:21.487 --> 20:22.653
To build shipping crates.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.823
Charlie's here
to check out the operation.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.725
I didn't know
that you knew elizabeth.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.160
We're just friends.

20:29.162 --> 20:30.928
Very good friends.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.897
We go way back.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.499
Mm. Okay. Well, um...

20:35.501 --> 20:37.001
When you get a minute,

20:37.003 --> 20:38.202
Why don't you come by the office
and I'll show you around?

20:38.204 --> 20:39.270
Will do.
Thank you.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.271
Of course.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.272
Elizabeth.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.284
So, it's really
just a coincidence

20:53.286 --> 20:55.419
That my father's
top sales representative

20:55.421 --> 20:57.755
Decided to start doing
business with lee coulter,

20:57.757 --> 21:00.791
Whose sawmill just happens
to be in hope valley?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.327
He did give us
the best price.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.063
Charles, I have
known you too long.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.965
Tell me...

21:07.967 --> 21:10.334
Is there a good place
to eat in this town?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.739
Well, abigail's
has wonderful food.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.774
Oh. Well, then,

21:16.776 --> 21:19.410
I hope you'll
join me for dinner.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.444
I'm sorry.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.146
I can't this evening.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.714
Ah.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.283
I see.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.552
You're otherwise
engaged.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.389
Yes.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.124
Well, then maybe
after I meet with lee,

21:33.126 --> 21:34.458
You'll spend
a little time

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
Showing me
around hope valley?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.462
Of course.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.243
-[sighing]
-oh.

21:52.245 --> 21:53.744
Hello.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.012
Hello.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.414
Luke.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.049
I remember.

21:59.117 --> 22:00.251
I'd like to apologize.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.752
For what?

22:01.754 --> 22:03.587
Well, the way you ran
out of the store the other day,

22:03.589 --> 22:04.622
I felt terrible.

22:04.624 --> 22:05.923
If anything I said
offended you--

22:05.925 --> 22:08.292
No. It wasn't anything
you said, luke.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.761
You were
very polite.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.530
Thank you.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.103
[laughs] well...

22:19.105 --> 22:22.239
I have some things
to purchase for abigail.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.109
Oh!

22:25.111 --> 22:26.977
Sure. Of course.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.113
Well, it was nice
seeing you again.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.615
It was nice seeing
you again, too.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.321
Clara?

22:37.323 --> 22:39.123
Yes?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.391
Now that we got clear

22:40.393 --> 22:41.625
That you weren't offended
by what I said,

22:41.627 --> 22:42.693
I was wondering--

22:42.695 --> 22:44.295
I'm wondering
about something, too.

22:44.297 --> 22:46.297
You are? What's that?

22:46.299 --> 22:47.531
Are you ever
going to ask me again

22:47.533 --> 22:48.799
To that ice cream social?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.402
Uh...

22:51.404 --> 22:52.837
Clara?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.038
Would you allow me

22:54.040 --> 22:55.840
To escort you
to the ice cream social?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.708
I thought you'd never ask.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.809
If it's all right,

22:58.811 --> 23:00.044
I'll come calling for you
around 4:00.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.846
I'll see you around 4:00.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.481
[giggles]

23:12.324 --> 23:13.724
That's all of it.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.493
We hit six towns,
including hope valley.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.162
Nice take.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.563
And the plates?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.377
[gun hammer cocks]

23:33.379 --> 23:34.845
A lot of work,
cleaning that money.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.180
Never liked the idea

23:36.182 --> 23:38.115
Of you just leaving us
with the funny stuff.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.583
[horse snorts]

23:44.222 --> 23:46.257
[gun discharges]

23:47.592 --> 23:49.927
I'd drop my gun
if I were you.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.028
[thud]

23:52.798 --> 23:54.432
You all right?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.566
I thought I told you
to stay out of this!

23:55.568 --> 23:56.567
Bill,
these guys were--

23:56.569 --> 23:57.501
I had it handled!

23:58.570 --> 24:01.205
You've blown my cover!

24:01.207 --> 24:03.140
If I hadn't rode in,
you'd be a dead man.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.447
Get 'em tied up
and take 'em in.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.329
It was a bit
of a shock,

24:25.331 --> 24:26.797
His suddenly
showing up like that.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.500
Oh, I made a complete
fool of myself.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.936
Oh! I seriously doubt that.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.638
It's quite clear that
charles thinks the world of you.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.841
[sighs] I know, but...

24:36.843 --> 24:40.678
I just assumed he was coming
here specifically to see me.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.746
I've never been so embarrassed
in my life.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.615
Elizabeth, charles cares
about you so much,

24:44.617 --> 24:48.853
I'm sure it made you
that much more endearing to him.

24:49.955 --> 24:50.921
Does jack know he's here?

24:54.526 --> 24:55.860
I told luke

24:55.862 --> 24:57.294
I'd go with him
to the ice cream social.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.096
That's wonderful!

25:00.131 --> 25:01.265
Isn't it?

25:01.267 --> 25:03.834
Well, I've been
thinking it over and...

25:03.836 --> 25:05.102
Now I'm not so sure.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.438
Why?

25:07.440 --> 25:10.007
Well, I haven't been on a date
in a very long time,

25:10.009 --> 25:11.775
And never
to an ice cream social.

25:11.777 --> 25:14.478
Maybe I was too hasty.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.514
I mean, I'm not sure
how I'm supposed to even act.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.882
There's no special
way to act.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.450
You just have to
be yourself.

25:19.452 --> 25:20.518
Clara,
something tells me

25:20.520 --> 25:22.786
That that's not the
real problem, is it?

25:23.855 --> 25:25.789
No.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.292
Abigail, the social is tomorrow,

25:28.294 --> 25:30.294
And I have
nothing to wear.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.729
I don't have any makeup!

25:31.731 --> 25:32.730
I don't know
what to do with my hair.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.697
You can use
some of my makeup.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.698
I will do your hair.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.699
I'll loan you a dress!

25:35.701 --> 25:37.401
Oh, no, I couldn't.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.536
Of course you can!

25:38.538 --> 25:39.904
I'll even lend you
some jewelry.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.505
-Elizabeth, I...
-I don't think--

25:41.507 --> 25:42.673
...There's any use
in protesting.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.575
No. None.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.911
And by the time
we're through with you,

25:46.913 --> 25:48.312
You will
look so beautiful,

25:48.314 --> 25:50.748
Luke may just faint
when he sees you.

25:52.017 --> 25:52.983
Or at least
get a little dizzy.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.118
Come on.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.661
Ahh. Miss rosemary.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.195
May I help you
find something?

26:05.197 --> 26:06.730
I believe you can,
mr. Yost.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.099
[whispers]:
I'm looking for a victrola.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.101
A victrola?

26:11.103 --> 26:13.070
I-I don't get
many calls for those,

26:13.072 --> 26:14.705
So I don't stock them,

26:14.707 --> 26:16.607
But I could special order
you one from a catalog.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.175
Well, I would need it
by tomorrow night.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.443
Oh. Well, uh...

26:19.445 --> 26:21.779
Special orders take
at least a week.

26:21.781 --> 26:22.880
No!

26:22.882 --> 26:25.382
This is extremely
important.

26:25.384 --> 26:26.951
Not just for me, but...

26:26.953 --> 26:29.253
Well, for the future
of this town!

26:29.255 --> 26:30.387
Miss rosemary,
I can't imagine

26:30.389 --> 26:32.289
How a victrola
could be that important,

26:32.291 --> 26:34.858
But if it is,
I could lend my own.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.760
[gasps] would you? Oh!

26:36.762 --> 26:37.928
That would
be wonderful.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.030
But you'd
have to promise

26:40.032 --> 26:41.298
To take very good
care of it.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.766
I use it every night to play
some records I just got

26:42.768 --> 26:44.301
With that new
"ragtime" music.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.037
Oh, isn't that music
just divine?

26:47.039 --> 26:48.639
Don't worry.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.708
I'll treat it
like my own child.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.544
I-I didn't know
you had a child.

26:53.546 --> 26:55.245
I don't.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.547
Whatever gave you that idea?

26:56.549 --> 26:59.683
I'll be by later with a friend
to pick it up.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.586
Right.

27:02.588 --> 27:03.520
[door opens and closes]

27:05.824 --> 27:07.725
I think it's
the beauty of this place

27:07.727 --> 27:09.460
That I find
so uplifting.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.961
That,
and the honest,

27:10.963 --> 27:13.230
Hard-working people
I've met here.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.298
I can't deny,

27:14.300 --> 27:15.833
It's a very different life

27:15.835 --> 27:18.102
Than either of us
were raised in.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.070
And a good life,
charles.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.072
A life where
I feel valued.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.908
You can't say you didn't
feel valued in hamilton.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.578
You have family
and friends who adore you.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.480
Yes. I know that.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.348
But there's
a difference between

27:31.350 --> 27:32.583
Being valued by
family and friends

27:32.585 --> 27:33.751
For who you are

27:33.753 --> 27:35.285
And being
valued by people

27:35.287 --> 27:36.754
For the contribution
you make to them.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.288
Your students.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.090
Yes.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.660
You know, there are
students in hamilton

27:42.662 --> 27:43.994
Who would benefit
from your work as well.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.764
Yes, but the children
in hamilton

27:46.766 --> 27:48.632
Have far more
opportunities

27:48.634 --> 27:50.868
And far more teachers!

27:50.870 --> 27:54.538
For the children here,
I'm their only teacher.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.941
The work I'm doing here
can change their lives.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.376
Give them opportunities

27:59.378 --> 28:01.045
They wouldn't
otherwise have.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.380
Don't you know how
rewarding that is?

28:05.183 --> 28:06.517
So that's the reason

28:06.519 --> 28:09.186
This place has
such a hold on you.

28:10.488 --> 28:12.423
Or is there
something more?

28:14.392 --> 28:16.126
[sighs]

28:16.128 --> 28:17.461
Didn't you say

28:17.463 --> 28:19.430
That you only came
to hope valley for business?

28:22.500 --> 28:23.834
You realize the liability

28:23.836 --> 28:25.703
Of becoming involved
with a mountie.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.773
I'm well aware of it.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.776
You know I'm only
thinking of your welfare.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.946
I know that.

28:40.351 --> 28:42.386
I think we should
be heading back.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.928
[bill]:
I'll contact headquarters.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.832
Make sure no one
speaks to them.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.734
Why didn't you tell me
you were working undercover?

28:56.736 --> 28:58.168
It kind of defeats
the purpose,

28:58.170 --> 29:00.771
Doesn't it?

29:00.773 --> 29:01.905
You were my mentor.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.173
Since when
can't you trust me?

29:03.175 --> 29:04.908
Since you don't
follow my instructions

29:04.910 --> 29:06.577
And stick your nose
in my business.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.914
You're welcome.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.182
For what?

29:12.184 --> 29:14.318
For saving your life.

29:33.304 --> 29:34.471
[horn blares]

29:43.047 --> 29:44.314
Oh! You are a daredevil!

29:44.316 --> 29:45.549
I will admit,

29:45.551 --> 29:48.652
I've never driven a car
this fast before.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.125
Let me drive.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.928
You serious?

29:57.930 --> 29:59.429
You can't drive.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.098
Well, who says?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.399
Well, have you ever
driven a car before?

30:02.401 --> 30:04.301
No.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.502
But you can teach me.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.937
I don't think so.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.939
Oh, don't be a wet blanket.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.674
I taught you how to tango.

30:10.676 --> 30:11.975
Learning to dance
and learning to drive

30:11.977 --> 30:13.343
Are two very
different things.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.547
Driving this car is like
taming a team of wild horses.

30:17.682 --> 30:20.484
Then teach me
how to tame them.

30:23.188 --> 30:25.355
[laughs]

30:25.357 --> 30:28.258
I can't believe
I'm about to agree to this.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.927
All right.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.862
[giggles] yes!

30:31.864 --> 30:33.864
Okay.

30:39.270 --> 30:40.437
Okay.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.805
Yeah.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.540
[engine fires up]

30:43.542 --> 30:44.842
[yelping]

30:57.121 --> 30:58.922
Jack.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.459
Charles.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.027
Heard you were in town.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.729
Some business
with the sawmill?

31:05.731 --> 31:08.732
Yes. Lee runs
an excellent operation.

31:08.734 --> 31:09.833
We've made a deal

31:09.835 --> 31:12.569
That's going to make
him quite wealthy.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.572
Tell me. Is it possible
to get a carriage here?

31:15.574 --> 31:16.673
I've decided
to go to buxton

31:16.675 --> 31:17.808
And get the train,

31:17.810 --> 31:19.243
Rather than wait
for the stage tomorrow.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.911
You know,
I wouldn't recommend it.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.647
It's not the safest territory
to cross for a man alone.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.916
I see.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.753
I suspect
you've seen elizabeth?

31:29.755 --> 31:31.555
Yes.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.190
She took me on a tour
of hope valley.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.858
Showed me the pond.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.660
Beautiful spot.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.162
It is. It's excellent
fishing out there.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.365
I suppose.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.567
But it would appear
that you need the right bait

31:43.569 --> 31:44.935
In order to catch anything.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.670
Yeah.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.706
Some fish seem to like one type
of bait more than another.

31:49.708 --> 31:50.807
Of course.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.443
I suppose the question is,

31:53.445 --> 31:55.913
How does the fisherman know
which is the best bait?

31:55.915 --> 31:58.382
I find that people
that have the most success

31:58.384 --> 32:00.183
Seem to fish
every day.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.219
So it helps if you're a local.

32:02.221 --> 32:05.122
And have you had
much success lately?

32:05.124 --> 32:07.157
I'd say it's been pretty good.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.795
Charles...

32:11.797 --> 32:14.631
I don't mind sharing
one thing I've learned.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.467
You don't need
an expensive lure.

32:17.469 --> 32:21.405
Just your ordinary,
everyday live bait

32:21.407 --> 32:23.340
Seems to be all you need
to reel them in.

32:25.143 --> 32:26.977
Thanks for the tip.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.159
[humming quietly]

32:49.634 --> 32:50.968
[door opens and closes]

32:50.970 --> 32:52.736
Lee.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.671
I think it's time you got
to know me a bit better.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.674
Good evening to you,
too, rosemary.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.010
Now that you've got
the sawmill going,

33:00.012 --> 33:01.979
You're going to have
some extra time on your hands.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.480
Well, as
a matter of fact--

33:03.482 --> 33:04.848
You know
the old saying,

33:04.850 --> 33:07.918
"all work and no play
makes lee a dull boy."

33:07.920 --> 33:10.520
I believe
it's "makes <i>jack</i> a dull boy."

33:10.522 --> 33:12.489
-Yes.
-Yes.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.690
But we're not
talking about jack.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.025
Oh, good. I'm glad.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.093
What I think what you need,

33:16.095 --> 33:19.129
After working so hard
all this time...

33:19.131 --> 33:20.764
Is a night out.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.199
A night out?

33:22.201 --> 33:23.700
Is that so?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.836
And what I propose
is, tomorrow evening,

33:25.838 --> 33:28.638
I take you
to see something...

33:28.640 --> 33:30.941
You've never seen before.

33:30.943 --> 33:32.442
[laughs]

33:32.444 --> 33:34.611
Can you provide me with
a little bit more information?

33:34.613 --> 33:36.680
Actually, no.
I want it to be a surprise.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.682
But I can
assure you

33:38.684 --> 33:40.550
It will be
a most memorable evening.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.619
Hmm.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.187
Trust me!

33:44.189 --> 33:47.691
Mm. Two words that get people
into an awful lot of trouble.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.360
I promise--
you won't regret it.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.739
[elizabeth laughing]

34:12.417 --> 34:14.317
Well, thank you
for a wonderful dinner.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.219
You're welcome.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.556
[both chuckling]

34:21.692 --> 34:24.194
So I heard you saw
charles today,

34:24.196 --> 34:26.196
At the stables?

34:26.198 --> 34:29.132
Yeah. We had
a nice chat.

34:32.437 --> 34:34.037
About what?

34:34.039 --> 34:35.906
Fishing.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.908
Fishing?

34:37.910 --> 34:40.077
Fishing.
Apparently, he's...

34:40.079 --> 34:43.213
Quite interested
in the sport.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.182
I had no idea.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.253
You know...

34:50.255 --> 34:53.090
I thought it was
an interesting coincidence

34:53.092 --> 34:55.225
That your father's
company decided

34:55.227 --> 34:57.294
To do business here
with lee's sawmill.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.164
I thought so, too.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.337
Good evening, elizabeth.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.640
Mr. Avery.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.275
What happened?

35:12.277 --> 35:14.211
Ah, nothing serious.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.812
I'm glad I ran into you.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.115
Jack, I owe you an apology.

35:18.117 --> 35:21.718
I was a little out of
sorts this afternoon.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.720
I should have said thank you.

35:24.922 --> 35:26.389
That's all right.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.058
What did you do?

35:28.060 --> 35:30.160
Well, I guess you could say
he saved my life.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.296
Goodnight, jack.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.031
Elizabeth.

35:38.569 --> 35:39.569
Jack!

35:41.339 --> 35:43.073
What happened?

35:43.075 --> 35:44.774
I was just doing my job.

35:44.776 --> 35:47.477
What kind of danger
were you in?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.112
It was...

35:49.114 --> 35:50.547
Mountie business.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.351
Jack, if we're going to have
any kind of relationship,

35:54.353 --> 35:56.853
I need you to be
completely honest with me,

35:56.855 --> 35:58.822
Regardless of the circumstance.

35:59.924 --> 36:01.525
Elizabeth...

36:01.527 --> 36:03.860
It's not that I don't
want to tell you.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.096
It's just sometimes
a mountie's work

36:06.098 --> 36:07.097
Is unpredictable and--

36:07.099 --> 36:09.699
And dangerous.

36:09.701 --> 36:13.870
And some of the things that--
that I get involved in--

36:13.872 --> 36:16.673
I'm just not at liberty
to tell you about.

36:17.775 --> 36:20.677
[â™ª]

36:34.325 --> 36:36.626
Thanks for coming in.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.595
Enjoy the rest of your day.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.301
Oh! You must be luke.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.136
Yes, ma'am.

36:46.138 --> 36:48.638
I'm abigail stanton.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.340
Oh, won't you come in?

36:50.342 --> 36:52.509
Why don't you have
a seat right here?

36:52.511 --> 36:54.578
Clara is still
getting ready.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.479
Thank you.

36:56.481 --> 36:57.581
Well...

36:57.583 --> 37:01.384
So, luke,
tell me about yourself.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.719
Did you go to school?

37:02.721 --> 37:04.888
Yes, ma'am.
I graduated high school.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.024
Great! And you have a job
here in town?

37:08.026 --> 37:09.226
Got a job today!

37:09.228 --> 37:10.594
I'm going to be working
at the mercantile.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.195
Wonderful.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.397
And your family
must have recently arrived.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.533
I don't think
I know your parents.

37:16.535 --> 37:19.169
My dad works at the sawmill
and that's what brought us.

37:19.171 --> 37:21.271
[â™ª]

37:21.273 --> 37:24.074
Clara.

37:28.713 --> 37:29.913
These are for you.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.782
Oh! Daisies.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.185
My favorite.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.255
Well...

37:38.257 --> 37:39.456
You two better get going.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.058
Yes, ma'am.

37:42.060 --> 37:42.959
I'll put those
in water for you.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.261
Thank you.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.528
You look so beautiful.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.564
Have a wonderful time.

37:47.566 --> 37:48.865
Thank you
both so much.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.201
You really have made me
feel like family.

37:51.203 --> 37:53.937
Clara,
you are family.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.572
You two enjoy
yourselves.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.241
Yes, ma'am.
We will.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.676
[â™ª]

38:13.057 --> 38:15.992
[â™ª]

38:15.994 --> 38:17.727
[lee laughs]

38:17.729 --> 38:21.431
Well, where did
all this come from?

38:21.433 --> 38:24.634
I... Built it
for miss rosemary.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.170
Now, don't you get
upset at hickam.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.805
I kind of twisted
his arm to do it.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.940
It's all right,
hickam, I'm not upset.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.443
I know how hard it is
to say no to this lady.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.178
Now, you just sit down,

38:35.180 --> 38:36.913
Right here.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.915
Okay.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.670
[music rises]

39:04.642 --> 39:08.311
â™ª let me call you
sweetheart â™ª

39:08.313 --> 39:12.682
â™ª I'm in love with you

39:12.684 --> 39:16.786
â™ª let me hear you whisper

39:16.788 --> 39:21.991
â™ª that you love me, too

39:21.993 --> 39:25.829
â™ª keep the lovelight glowing

39:25.831 --> 39:30.867
â™ª in your eyes so true

39:30.869 --> 39:35.004
â™ª let me call you
sweetheart â™ª

39:35.006 --> 39:40.910
â™ª I'm in love with you

39:42.646 --> 39:45.181
That was fantastic!

39:45.183 --> 39:46.483
Oh, did you like it?

39:46.485 --> 39:47.517
Did I like it?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.219
You're incredible.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.321
Well, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

39:51.323 --> 39:54.557
Now, is it worth
building a theater for me?

39:54.559 --> 39:56.726
[takes a deep breath]

39:56.728 --> 39:59.229
Well... Contracts
are coming in.

39:59.231 --> 40:03.600
Shouldn't be long
before we're turning a profit.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.835
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

40:05.837 --> 40:07.370
But yes,

40:07.372 --> 40:09.606
Rosemary leveaux, I promise,
you will get your theater.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.842
Oh, lee! Thank you!

40:12.844 --> 40:14.244
And I want you to know--

40:14.246 --> 40:16.846
That's not the only reason
I like you.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.748
Can I trust you on that?

40:20.017 --> 40:21.418
[giggles]

40:21.420 --> 40:24.187
That was great.
It was great!

40:25.456 --> 40:27.824
[â™ª]

40:35.633 --> 40:38.168
[quiet exchange]

40:41.205 --> 40:43.873
Always wonderful
to see you, elizabeth.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.475
For me as well, charles.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.243
And it looks like
we're going to continue

40:47.245 --> 40:48.111
Doing business
with lee's sawmill,

40:48.113 --> 40:49.946
So I suspect

40:49.948 --> 40:51.581
I'll be back
every now and then.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.249
I will look forward to it.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.784
I look forward to it, too.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.386
-That's a beautiful scarf.
-[laughing]

40:56.388 --> 40:58.955
[â™ª]

40:58.957 --> 41:00.957
Jack...

41:02.993 --> 41:05.395
[elizabeth giggling]

41:05.397 --> 41:08.031
[â™ª]

41:09.400 --> 41:10.733
Is that
charles kensington

41:10.735 --> 41:12.335
Elizabeth just kissed?

41:12.337 --> 41:13.837
Yep.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.372
[â™ª]

41:17.908 --> 41:20.243
I thought they were
just friends?

41:20.245 --> 41:22.879
[â™ª]

41:32.089 --> 41:34.557
[â™ª]
