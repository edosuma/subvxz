00:15.840 --> 00:19.280
- What did we do, Vic?
- Hey, what we had to.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.480
- Oh, Christ. Come on, man.
- Enough. Come on.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.800
Terry was gonna turn you in. Vic
wanted him dead. Vic needed him dead!

00:25.000 --> 00:26.320
No!

00:26.520 --> 00:28.160
I know.

00:30.240 --> 00:36.040
Now, Shane, listen to me.
We're gonna ride this out. Right?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.360
Our fellow officer was dying
in that hospital.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.840
- I said a prayer for him.
- A prayer?

00:41.040 --> 00:43.880
I give you some money, you skip
a couple of tricks, get some soup?

00:44.040 --> 00:45.560
I don't need your money, Vic.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.320
Here. You look thin. Get some soup.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.440
Don't worry about me, Vic. I get by.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.560
Are you sure?

00:59.880 --> 01:05.400
Okay, come on. Take your seats.
Today is warrant-sweep day.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.600
I know. We all hate sweeps.
We all hate sweeps.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.880
But as long as they've got open
warrants, we've got to serve them.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.480
You've all been assigned several
suspects. Find them. Bring them in.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.840
If you see one of your regulars,
bring them in too.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.880
We've probably got an open warrant
for them as well.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.160
Word on the street will spread quickly.
We've only got three to four hours.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.960
And listen, these are
the worst of the worst.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.520
So watch out for yourself
and your partner.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.160
That's it. Go find them.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.280
These are all over the place.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.160
Hey, anybody got an Echo Park
for a Koreatown?

01:41.320 --> 01:45.440
Here. But you gotta take
Alvarado Corridor too.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.680
Here. Let me see that. Is that Virgil?

01:51.840 --> 01:56.480
Beautiful. Asshole took a swing at me
last time, in front of some kids.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.440
- I got this one.
- Sarge says you got a visitor.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.640
Police! Freeze, sucker!

02:13.160 --> 02:15.040
What's the matter?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.920
You all right?

02:22.640 --> 02:25.640
- He had a knife.
- The john?

02:26.400 --> 02:28.840
Okay, let me see.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.600
- Oh, Jesus.
- He seemed normal, you know?

02:38.320 --> 02:41.360
- Yeah.
- Even paid upfront.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.600
I go to put the condom on,
and the asshole...

02:43.760 --> 02:45.800
...he smacks me,
and he tries to rape me.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.840
What?

02:48.040 --> 02:50.560
I know a rape, for chrissake.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.320
All right, what then?

02:56.120 --> 02:59.240
I kicked and scratched till I got away.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.600
I got some of his licence plate.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.400
I want this prick to hurt.

03:10.840 --> 03:11.960
- Dutch.
- Yeah.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.560
I need a favour.
Connie here had a bad night.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.560
Aceveda dumped a ton of warrants
on my desk. I was wondering...

03:17.720 --> 03:21.160
- You want me to serve them for you?
- No, I'll kick down my own doors.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.880
Can you get her to a hospital,
find out who cut her up?

03:25.040 --> 03:28.840
- Sure. Why don't you come with me.
- I'm fine.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.360
We'll get you patched up. You can
tell me what happened on the way.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.360
Go on. I'll check in...

03:34.520 --> 03:37.680
- Are you coming too?
- Yeah, I'll check in on you later.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.680
Hey, Dutchboy, thanks. I owe you one.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.360
- Freeze! Police!
- Get down!

03:52.560 --> 03:55.240
Get down!
Get down on the floor right now!

03:55.440 --> 03:57.200
- Hey, remember me?
- Yeah, I remember.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.640
On your face.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.080
- I'll tell you what.
- Hands up.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.760
You tell me when these bracelets
get too tight.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.600
Yeah, just like that.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.160
- Yo, man with the tools.
- Hands up!

04:11.360 --> 04:12.880
Put your hands on your head.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.279
Hands on your head. Get out here.
Come on.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.760
- Damn. You're...
- Derrick Tripp.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.160
Derrick Tripp, yeah.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.160
- Jersey's in town to play the Lakers.
- Put your hands back up.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.240
You miss the exit
for the Staples Center?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.800
No, man, I'm just chilling.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.880
Yeah, well chilling with cheebas is
a problem here in L.A. Grab some wall.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.440
Come on, man. It's just a private party.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.360
That's some party favour.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.880
- I got stalkers.
- Is that right?

04:41.040 --> 04:43.360
- You got a permit for this?
- Left it in Jersey.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.520
Well, that's a shame.
What are we gonna do about this?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.960
Get those geniuses back down
to the Barn.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.280
- All right, let's go. Get up.
- You stay put.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.440
Let's go have some fun.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.320
Check this out.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.360
It's gonna be a zoo
when we haul this guy in.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.880
- Yeah.
- Never liked him.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.280
- He always gives the Lakers fits.
- Not tonight, he won't.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.920
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

05:14.640 --> 05:17.360
How'd you like to change
the course of sports history?

05:18.440 --> 05:19.880
What do you need it for?

05:20.040 --> 05:22.960
We're conducting surveillance
on an apartment across the street.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.280
- How long you gonna be here?
- Out by tonight.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.640
- You gonna break anything?
- Don't plan on it.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.920
It's a bitch to collect from the city,
you know?

05:33.440 --> 05:35.720
Here's a deposit.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.240
- Drop them in the mailbox.
- Appreciate it.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.400
Come on.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.440
What are we doing here?

05:52.640 --> 05:55.520
Keeping you out of the limelight
until we get a handle on this.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.960
Did you do that sneaker
commercial in one take?

05:58.160 --> 06:01.600
No way. That was some CGI mojo.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.640
One take, all real.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.720
You're the man.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.560
Sponsors ain't gonna be too thrilled
to hear about this.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.160
- I got a morals clause in my contracts.
- Let me see if I can help you out.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.240
Give me one minute.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.880
- Hello.
- Hi, there, captain. Vic Mackey here.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.160
- What are you up to now?
- I got a problem.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.880
Just arrested Derrick Tripp
on weapons charges.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.600
The basketball player? Exciting.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.000
Right. He's playing against
the Lakers tonight.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.520
We're meeting Matthew's teacher at 7.
Don't forget.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.080
I certainly won't, sir.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.440
Would it help if I dropped off
clothes at work?

06:41.640 --> 06:43.600
- Certainly would.
- Okay, then.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.400
I'll tell him. Lemansky's got
the address.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.480
- Is that it, or should I keep talking?
- That won't be necessary.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.480
I'll see you soon.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.360
Captain's a big fan. He'll come down
here and make this thing go away.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.840
- Cool.
- In the meantime, just chill out.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.240
You, you're nuts, man.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.880
Without Tripp's penetration and
outside shot, the Lakers are a lock.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.320
Damn, I gotta call my bookie.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.040
You know what I love? I love what you
said to that ref in game six last year.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.360
You know what I love? I love what you
said to that ref in game six last year.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.320
I had to say something.
That call was weak.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.480
Looked like a foul to me.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.080
Where was you watching it from?
Your 20-inch black-and-white?

07:35.280 --> 07:39.200
Hey. We stopped by Big 5.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.040
How about a couple autographs?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.240
- The captain's on his way, right?
- Any minute now.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.120
I don't usually sign for free.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.560
- You're kidding.
- 150 a pop.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.200
- Even little kids?
- People send their kids up to score.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.080
"Derrick, please sign this for me."

07:57.240 --> 07:59.760
Then Daddy turns around
and scalps it on the Internet.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.440
Got that.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.320
Derrick, sign this one
for my son, Matt.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.240
It's on the up and up.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.880
- Yeah, man.
- Cool.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.280
Fifteen million a year, and you
gotta charge for an autograph?

08:13.440 --> 08:14.880
Wouldn't you say that's weak?

08:15.080 --> 08:17.240
The papers print 15 million...

08:17.400 --> 08:20.560
...but after my agent, taxes,
lawyers, publicist...

08:20.760 --> 08:22.960
...and business manager,
15 mil it ain't.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.880
Oh, wow, that's rough.
So, what's that, like 6 million?

08:27.040 --> 08:31.040
- Ain't 15 mil, is it?
- No, it isn't.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.280
So look, I put a call into Murphy, man.
Spread's six and a half.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.679
Lem and Ronnie are in for a grand
each. I'm in for five. How about you?

08:42.840 --> 08:45.480
- I'll pass.
- Are you kidding?

08:45.640 --> 08:47.760
Nobody knows about this.
It's like free money.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.280
The Lakers can clinch home court
for the playoffs.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.760
- It's about... It's not about the money.
- Well, it is to this asshole.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.120
Hundred and fifty a pop. I'm surprised
the guy can sign his own name.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.680
- What do you care?
- I don't.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.240
What are we gonna do about
the rest of our warrants?

09:02.400 --> 09:03.760
Already took care of it.

09:07.640 --> 09:11.280
Vic Mackey called,
told me to turn myself in.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.840
Line forms over there.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.080
Goddamn warrant sweeps.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.800
Problem, Nathan?

09:23.640 --> 09:25.960
I'm one person doing a two-man job.
Look at this.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.280
I know. Fortunately, I have
my MVP running the show.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.880
MVP?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.560
Most valuable policeman.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.480
I wouldn't schedule these sweeps if I
wasn't sure you'd anchor the desk.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.400
You're not gonna let me down, are you?

09:40.560 --> 09:42.160
Of course not, sir.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.640
That's what I wanted to hear.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.080
- Capt. Aceveda?
- Yes.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.880
Marsha Kramer,
attorney for Derrick Tripp.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.840
The basketball player?

09:55.440 --> 09:58.360
No hits on killers raping hookers
at knifepoint.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.560
What about the partial plate?

10:00.760 --> 10:04.280
The one our bag-bride scribbled on
her hand while running for her life?

10:04.440 --> 10:07.880
Six hundred matches. I'll have
her look at every single one.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.760
Hooker murders are up
for the entire East Side.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.240
Past few show some similarities.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.840
You're studying killings
on the entire East Side?

10:16.040 --> 10:19.320
The whole city. You never know
when a disturbing pattern will emerge.

10:19.480 --> 10:23.280
I think I'm witnessing
a disturbing pattern.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.280
I wanna make sure
nothing slips through.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.040
You're just looking for something
big and juicy.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.160
Three months ago, Griffith Park,
beaten with a pipe.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.480
Six weeks ago, Eagle Rock,
strangled by hand.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.880
Two weeks ago, liquor-store dumpster,
choked with a rope.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.560
Different locations, different weapons.
Some pattern.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.360
They're all posed facedown.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.080
You're stretching, son. Try yoga.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.680
Connie was supposed to be victim
number four. We need a task force.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.080
You need more evidence than that.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.880
I'm taking it to Aceveda.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.880
All he's gonna do is say no.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.840
No.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.160
Let's find the guy who attacked Connie,
try to tie him to the other murders.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.560
Sounds like a plan.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.280
Please, this is a mistake.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.680
Where have I heard that before?

11:15.840 --> 11:18.080
- Got another one for you, Nathan.
- I see that.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.480
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.800
- Haven't I seen you hanging around?
- Step back.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.920
No, I have, haven't I?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.640
Hanging around outside The Abbey.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.960
- Abbey?
- You know, West Hollywood.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.000
- How come you never go in? It's fun.
- You've got the wrong guy.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.240
Whatever you say, officer.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.920
Stand back and wait in line.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.920
I told you, he's not here.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.440
I gave you a description.
Why can't Vic take care of this?

11:48.840 --> 11:52.440
We're helping you, hon. Keep looking.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.880
Hey, wait.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.600
That's him.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.080
- That's the asshole.
- William Greeley.

12:03.240 --> 12:07.080
"Trespassing on federal grounds
as part of an environmental protest.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.120
Three years ago. Charges dismissed."

12:10.280 --> 12:12.960
Not exactly a criminal mastermind.
You sure?

12:13.120 --> 12:14.680
Of course I'm sure.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.240
I'll call for a warrant.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.560
So you and Vic are...

12:24.720 --> 12:26.880
...friends?

12:27.920 --> 12:29.280
Interesting.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.360
Vic and me have a bond
that transcends sex.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.640
Police! Freeze!

13:01.840 --> 13:03.320
What is this?

13:03.480 --> 13:05.320
- William Greeley.
- Yeah.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.320
Put some clothes on, man.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.360
Bolt cutters!

13:12.520 --> 13:15.320
Hey, stay out of there!
You got no right!

13:20.320 --> 13:23.280
You wanna bet on how many heads
he's got icing down in there?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.520
No, thanks.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.720
It's not mayonnaise.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.480
You keep away from my children!

13:48.640 --> 13:50.040
No!

13:53.120 --> 13:56.160
Vic? Vic, a word, please.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.640
Sure.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.160
- Who's your friend?
- This is Marsha Kramer...

14:01.320 --> 14:04.680
...an attorney representing
Derrick Tripp.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.080
Mr. Tripp was last seen
in your custody.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.360
We served a warrant
to one of his homeboys.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.760
He was there. The drugs weren't his.
He was freed.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.880
He was a good guy,
signed a couple autographs.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.680
- Something wrong?
- Tripp is missing.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.360
- Missing?
- He's not answering his cell phone.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.080
His friends, family, teammates,
management, me...

14:24.240 --> 14:27.040
No one has heard from him.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.280
Weird.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.720
Virgil Lewis said that it looked like
you were taking Mr. Tripp somewhere.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.920
Is this the same Virgil Lewis I busted
sucking on a joint as big as your arm?

14:37.520 --> 14:40.920
I think Virgil's memory might be
a little hazy.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.920
I left Tripp a while ago.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.160
- This is totally unacceptable.
- Vic.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.640
They stitch you up okay?

14:49.920 --> 14:53.560
Between this and my caesarean,
I'm a goddamn road map.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.960
- Jesus Christ.
- Those detectives won't let me leave.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.880
I gotta go see somebody, soon.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.280
All right, calm down.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.560
Go back there and chill out.
I'll find out what's going on, all right?

15:04.720 --> 15:05.880
Go on.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.160
I'd never hurt anyone.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.320
- What kind of work do you do, William?
- I was an actuary.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.880
What about now?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.960
I walked away six months ago.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.720
Needed some time off?
Pressure getting to you?

15:17.920 --> 15:21.920
Well, it's easy to lose your perspective
working every day.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.880
What does this have to do
with anything?

15:24.080 --> 15:26.160
What do you do for fun
with that free time?

15:26.920 --> 15:30.720
- I have some hobbies.
- I know. Nice sperm collection.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.120
Well, thank you.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.280
Jag?

15:37.480 --> 15:38.760
- Nope.
- Rolls?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.160
Please. Lamborghini.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.200
Sure, that's a sweet ride.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.160
Where the hell's this captain?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.640
Should be here within the hour.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.760
I ain't waiting no hour.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.160
Where do you think
you're going, sport?

15:52.320 --> 15:54.320
This captain's kicking
the charges anyway.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.560
I'll leave him will-call tickets
for the game.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.480
- You're staying here.
- See, this meeting's too big.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.880
- I ain't gonna miss it.
- Who's it with?

16:03.040 --> 16:05.440
One of my little L.A. Honeys I bang
when I'm in town.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.040
Maybe she would prefer
conjugal visits.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.240
Hey, bring her on down here, man.
There's a bedroom.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.160
What? It'll help pass the time
till the captain shows.

16:15.320 --> 16:20.320
If the men's room at Spago's worked
for her, I guess this will do.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.760
- Oh, you're a real classy guy.
- Here.

16:23.320 --> 16:26.520
Here, yo, use my cell phone.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.160
- Where were you last night?
- Home.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.920
Anyone vouch for that?

16:33.120 --> 16:36.000
<i>- I live alone.
- You go out?</i>

16:36.200 --> 16:37.480
- Yeah.
- Where?

16:40.120 --> 16:44.480
Well, you know, maybe I didn't go out.
I don't really remember.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.200
- Well, which is it, William?
- What about December 15?

16:47.360 --> 16:48.960
Were you out then?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.280
I don't know. Probably at home.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.360
- What about February 5?
- Home.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.280
Always home. Filling up those jars
is a full-time gig, huh?

16:59.480 --> 17:00.640
Back to last night...

17:00.840 --> 17:04.200
The name Kitty Weir mean anything?
She was a streetwalker on Sunset.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.880
I don't know what you're saying.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.359
- Dutch.
- March 3, Rosita Pedraza...

17:08.520 --> 17:10.920
...on Cesar Chavez.
You killed her too, didn't you?

17:11.119 --> 17:14.160
<i>- Dutch!
- I'd never kill anyone. I'm pro-life.</i>

17:14.319 --> 17:16.160
Jesus Christ.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.079
You're all over the map.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.160
This freak's straight out
of an FBI textbook.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.359
What happened to the original plan?

17:22.520 --> 17:25.359
Nail him for last night's assault,
use it as a building block.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.120
Classic façade of innocence and
charm with bizarre sexual fetishes.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.920
This kind wants to talk.
I have to lead him down the path.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.160
Trust me, his ego won't let him shut up.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.520
- Could we close this one case, please?
- I mean, Ted Bundy, anyone?

17:38.720 --> 17:41.960
The attack on the hooker comes first.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.960
Dutchboy, I asked you to find
Connie's john...

17:45.160 --> 17:47.680
...not Jack the Ripper.
- You're observing me?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.880
Fred Astaire never danced
around so much.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.280
- Let me see if I can jog his memory.
- No. You tried that with me once.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.880
Not again.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.600
Now, you asked Dutch for help,
you got it. We'll get the guy.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.400
Don't make me regret it.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.040
Don't make me regret it.

18:10.520 --> 18:10.680
Hey, Connie.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.440
Hey, Connie.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.160
They got your guy.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.680
You gonna let me watch?

18:16.840 --> 18:19.120
- Watch what?
- You kick the shit out of him.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.960
I think we'll have to settle
for jail time.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.440
I want him to feel the pain I felt.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.440
- Look, why don't you come lie down.
- I can't lie down!

18:34.520 --> 18:38.520
You know what?
I have to get out of here.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.360
I have a need, all right?

18:40.520 --> 18:44.400
The detectives need you to stay around
to contradict any statement he makes.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.760
Now stay in here, and I'll take care
of your need. Got it?

18:48.920 --> 18:51.040
Yeah.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.320
Just stay here, okay?

19:01.120 --> 19:03.320
Hey, hon.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.440
Hey, little man. There he is.
Come here.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.680
Who was that?

19:08.840 --> 19:11.320
It's a case I'm working on.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.280
Got my clothes?
Thanks.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.880
Hey, Matthew, what a treat
to see Daddy during the day.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.160
Let's hope we get to see him
tonight, huh?

19:20.360 --> 19:23.880
- Hope so.
- Hey, I can't miss that.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.080
Gotta see little man's teacher
and talk to her.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.880
You know, we've got a play date.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.520
Okay. Thanks for the fresh cape.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.320
Let's go help Mommy outside.
Come on.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.280
Derrick here?

19:44.440 --> 19:46.560
Shane Vendrell.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.560
So he's here or...?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.840
Yeah.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.320
Where?

19:55.640 --> 19:57.160
Hey, girl.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.040
God, I missed you.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.240
Oh, save it for Spago's.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.560
When are you gonna get traded
to a West Coast team?

20:09.720 --> 20:14.360
I'm here now, ain't I?
Go get the sheets warmed up.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.280
Okay.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.240
- Be right in.
- Okay.

20:22.640 --> 20:26.680
Damn. That is, like, the hottest chick
that's ever been, man.

20:26.840 --> 20:32.080
Her? Please, dog. Adriana's a par.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.080
I got this one in Seattle,
a goddamn birdie.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.600
Oh, she's probably spread her legs
for half the league.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.040
It's too bad you can't make
a jump shot.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.320
Hope y'all got your earplugs.
I'm going in.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.280
He's pretty confident.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.760
I'll be over here.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.840
- O for two.
- How many warrants left?

20:55.040 --> 20:57.480
Counting this no-show, one more.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.640
Neighbour here makes
quite the racket.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.280
She says she's gonna call us
when he gets back.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.440
Who's up?

21:42.040 --> 21:43.760
Felipé Tejada.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.360
- Officer.
- What?

21:54.520 --> 21:57.520
I really need your help.
All right, just give me five seconds.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.520
Why?

22:00.240 --> 22:03.160
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said before.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.360
You've got three seconds left.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.560
Okay. I passed a bad check. I paid
the fine. I got a suspended sentence.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.800
This warrant is a mistake. All you
gotta do is call my legal-aide guy.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.760
That would take another five seconds.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.920
Please. Look at me.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.000
And now look at the other guys in here.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.920
I'm not supposed to be here.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.040
Stand back.

22:39.640 --> 22:44.040
Gotta be careful with these guys.
They're all a bunch of con men.

22:44.440 --> 22:48.360
This is a nightmare.
I'd never hurt anyone, let alone rape.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.560
I don't even use prostitutes.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.640
I don't have to. Women need me.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.280
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a fact.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.960
Survival of the species.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.760
Meaning what?

22:59.920 --> 23:03.160
Well, men find large breasts attractive.

23:03.320 --> 23:07.080
They signify that a woman can
amply nourish her young.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.400
Conversely, women respond
to some of my assets.

23:12.920 --> 23:16.560
Well, I've seen you butt-naked, son.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.160
- Your assets don't impress.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.480
You see, penis size is overrated.

23:21.640 --> 23:26.080
I'm talking about my testes,
the true seed of male virility...

23:26.240 --> 23:28.720
...the engine that drives the train.

23:29.720 --> 23:33.240
I am packing a pair
you gotta see to believe.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.680
Found an old girlfriend.
Greeley's got a hair-trigger temper...

23:40.840 --> 23:44.160
...and an inoperable brain tumour
driving him schizo.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.960
That explains a few things.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.760
Doesn't explain why he's dumping
the bodies facedown.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.600
Will you forget about making a name
for yourself as a serial-killer hunter?

23:52.920 --> 23:56.280
We need to corroborate
the hooker story. Period.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.920
He wants to tell us.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.000
- Can't this wait? I'm right out front.
- Oh, yeah?

24:07.200 --> 24:10.240
Yeah, well, listen to this crap.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.120
Oh, God.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.520
Any word from the captain?

24:17.720 --> 24:19.680
No.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.640
Call him again. I'm almost done here.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.320
Oh, baby.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.360
The only reason he has any teeth left is
that I'm making a killing on this thing.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.360
- I upped my bet to 10 grand.
- Later.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.240
Vic? Vic.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.600
No! Give me my Evan!

24:45.720 --> 24:48.880
He's fine! Please! My baby!

24:49.040 --> 24:53.560
- Guy's a crackhead!
- He's dusted! Evan!

24:53.920 --> 24:56.040
It's cool. Why don't you give me Evan.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.560
No, he's on fire. He's burning up.
He's red-hot!

24:59.720 --> 25:02.360
He's fine! Please!

25:02.560 --> 25:05.560
- I gotta cool him down!
- I'm a doctor. I can cool Evan down.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.480
You don't look like a doctor.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.560
I get that all the time. Give him to me.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.480
- My baby!
- No, it's too late!

25:13.640 --> 25:15.840
- Don't do that!
- He's dying!

25:16.040 --> 25:17.880
Don't do that!

25:18.080 --> 25:20.040
Come on, man!

25:45.520 --> 25:47.080
Where's the guy?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.320
He's still under.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.640
Nice save, Vic.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.920
These nut-jobs have a way
of finding me. Be careful.

26:03.320 --> 26:07.680
This one tried to strangle me
on the way over here. Come on.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.280
Vic, I need a piece.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.840
All right, hold on, hold on.

26:15.320 --> 26:19.840
Smoke it by the window.
I can't have my office reeking of rock.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.680
When am I gonna see you again?

26:28.840 --> 26:31.120
You know the drill.

26:35.840 --> 26:41.440
Just remember, Section 101,
red tank top.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.640
How can I miss that body, right?

26:51.840 --> 26:53.280
- Okay.
- See you at the game.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.360
See you.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.040
See you, Adriana.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.360
- She's a sweet girl.
- Well, boys...

27:03.000 --> 27:05.680
...tell the captain he missed me.

27:05.840 --> 27:10.040
Another booty call?
One of your sponsor's Viagra?

27:10.520 --> 27:11.960
Shoot-around's at 5.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.040
You're not going anywhere, Romeo.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.080
- Get this captain on the phone.
- He's not available by phone.

27:18.280 --> 27:23.520
- You said you called him. Where is he?
- Police business. You'll have to wait.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.960
You been yanking me all day?

27:29.120 --> 27:30.800
Sit down.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.920
Ain't no captain coming, is there?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.120
I said, sit down. You're bugging me.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.680
You got your autographs,
a little peepshow.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.040
Game's over. Colour me gone.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.320
Hey, colour you staying, nigger.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.560
You'd love it if I popped you.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.880
Got your name in the papers
right next to mine.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.320
Come on, come on.

27:54.520 --> 27:58.640
Let's hear what my lawyers
have to say about this.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.720
Badge will look real nice
on my mantelpiece...

28:01.880 --> 28:04.520
...right next to my
Rookie of the Year trophy.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.080
- Shane, get off him!
- Come on, come on, come on.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.040
Hey, hey, I said, wait.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.040
Vic, please.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.720
Give me the lighter.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.720
Come on, give it.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.040
Okay, here.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.560
Blow it out the window.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.280
Aceveda.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.760
The hospital just called.
Baby checked out fine.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.480
- Good job.
- Good.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.560
I am curious. You saved that kid
from the same apartment complex...

28:46.720 --> 28:49.080
...where Tripp was last seen.
- Crazy, huh?

28:49.240 --> 28:52.080
I lost my wallet during the bust,
went back to look for it.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.360
- Oh, some luck.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.920
There's no smoking in here.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.640
My mistake.

29:00.040 --> 29:04.880
Derrick Tripp's Jersey's leading
scorer. They'll be hurting without him.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.880
No clue where he is?

29:07.040 --> 29:09.480
Come on, captain, you know
how these rich pricks are.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.160
He's probably got his face
snorkel-deep in some broad's snatch.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.640
Give him a few hours,
he'll come up for air.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.560
You know how these celebrities are.

29:19.720 --> 29:24.800
He's probably with a female admirer.
Give it a few hours. He'll turn up.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.120
Step away.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.360
I made some calls.
The warrant was a mistake.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.040
I apologise on behalf
of the department.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.080
See, that wasn't so tough, now,
was it?

29:38.240 --> 29:40.120
Sorry for the inconvenience.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.360
The only inconvenience is, I'm leaving
without your phone number.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.760
- Excuse me?
- I just meant so that I could...

29:45.920 --> 29:49.320
...thank you for doing me this favour.

29:51.720 --> 29:55.120
Who knows? Maybe I can return
the favour someday.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.960
If so, you know where to find me.

30:03.160 --> 30:07.960
We know about your brain tumour.
No wonder you're angry.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.400
I'm not a killer.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.480
William, tell me more
about your sperm.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.920
So many people waste it.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.360
With condoms...

30:19.440 --> 30:22.720
...masturbating indiscriminately.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.720
It's a holocaust.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.280
So you collect it?

30:28.480 --> 30:31.280
My tumour may render me
impotent one day.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.800
And with so many women needing me...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.160
You'll still be able
to impregnate them.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.600
I want my essence to be passed
on to the next generation.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.160
Who doesn't?

30:42.320 --> 30:44.720
I know I do.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.240
Can you give me a second, sport?

30:52.720 --> 30:55.840
- No.
- It's okay, Dutch.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.840
It's not okay by me.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.400
Oh, come on, buddy.
Help me out here.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.440
We need our privacy.

31:16.720 --> 31:21.160
Have a seat. I didn't see your name...

31:21.320 --> 31:24.760
...among the sergeant's applicants.
- Well, I've been putting it off.

31:24.920 --> 31:28.600
Don't. If you pass, you'll get
my recommendation.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.680
You'll receive a post immediately
instead of waiting on a list for months.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.680
Why the big endorsement?

31:34.840 --> 31:37.680
I'd like you in a leadership position.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.760
You mean you'd like to promote
a woman.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.680
It's not how you get there. It's what
you do once you have the chance.

31:44.840 --> 31:48.720
- I'm offering you the chance.
- I'll think about it.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.080
So I saw the bad-check writer
was released.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.560
For all his whining,
turns out it was a mistake.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.280
But you had to go and check
that out. He got to you.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.360
- No, I just believed him.
- Well, don't make it a habit.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.640
You do favours for these guys,
it comes back to bite you in the ass.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.960
Yeah?

32:12.120 --> 32:14.760
- Ricky Harris?
- Yeah?

32:14.920 --> 32:17.280
Come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.720
Yes.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.960
No problem. All right?
Just give me a second.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.640
Damn it!

32:24.240 --> 32:26.400
Pull that stuff up. Get that stuff out.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.280
- Hurry up.
- Is it okay if we come in?

32:28.440 --> 32:31.040
Yeah...

32:32.840 --> 32:34.960
You mind if we take a look around?

32:35.120 --> 32:37.320
There's nothing here.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.640
Let me see your hands.
Put them on top of your head.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.600
- You got any drugs in here?
- No, I'm clean.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.840
- Who are your buddies?
- Nobody.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.800
Come on, look, I'm ready. Let's just...

32:54.000 --> 32:56.080
Tattoo man, what are you doing
by that couch?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.920
- Just standing.
- Yeah?

32:58.120 --> 33:00.440
- Go stand over there.
- I'm not doing anything.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.160
- You heard me. Move.
- I thought you wanted him.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.480
One Tango 13, requesting backup.
30151 l2 Sutter.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.160
Everybody's cool. Let's just go.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.440
Tattoo man, you heard me.
Get over there.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.320
Don't you dare move!
I will blow your brains out!

33:19.520 --> 33:22.800
Get on the floor! On your stomachs.
Put your hands behind your head.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.280
Move it. Check the couch.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.040
Whatever he's got in there,
I got nothing to do with.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.120
Shut up.

33:35.160 --> 33:38.000
One Tango 13, code three.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.520
What good's your 15 million now,
asshole?

33:40.720 --> 33:43.360
- It's only six take-home.
- Shut up.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.120
- What's going on?
- This guy's totally out of control.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.920
I hope you hate your jobs.
They're about to disappear.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.840
Thinks he's goddamn Shaka Zulu.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.120
When you can fill 20,000 seats
at 200 a pop...

33:53.280 --> 33:54.760
...you'll get the cash and tail.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.840
Until then, drag your lily-white ass
back home to Simi Valley.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.560
Hey, I live in Hollywood, you mother...

34:00.720 --> 34:02.640
Come here.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.800
- Christ, what's the matter with you?
- What?

34:06.920 --> 34:09.960
- The guy resisted.
- Resisted what? I told you to babysit...

34:10.120 --> 34:11.840
Somebody needs to teach him a lesson.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.080
By doing what? Executing him?

34:14.239 --> 34:17.320
Well, why not?
I mean, isn't that what we do now?

34:18.040 --> 34:20.000
I told you, that's over.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.480
We killed a cop.

34:25.520 --> 34:31.159
Lem and Ronnie failed to clear
the room, and Two-Time killed Terry.

34:31.320 --> 34:35.719
Get over it and don't bring it up again.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.360
Your partner's very uptight.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.719
He overcompensates.

34:46.920 --> 34:51.560
He could learn a lot from you.
You're very maternal.

34:51.719 --> 34:54.440
You have kids, don't you?

34:55.040 --> 34:56.480
Two.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.560
- Boys?
- Girls.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.840
I knew that.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.520
They still at home?

35:05.720 --> 35:07.760
One's a schoolteacher.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.680
The other's a newspaper reporter.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.640
- You see them much?
- Not as much as I'd like.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.120
You ever think about having more?

35:19.320 --> 35:23.840
Well, it would have to be soon.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.400
I'd have to find the right man.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.120
What's he like?

35:31.520 --> 35:36.120
Compassionate, responsible...

35:36.920 --> 35:39.560
...honest.
- I'm those things.

35:42.720 --> 35:46.360
What if I told you
I could give you a son?

35:48.840 --> 35:50.960
Where were you last night?

35:51.080 --> 35:53.640
If I don't spread my seed,
it dies with me.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.320
You found a prostitute?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.880
Oh, come on, Will.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.480
If we're gonna make this step...

36:02.640 --> 36:04.680
...you gotta show me that you're...

36:04.840 --> 36:09.720
...the type of man who's gonna take
responsibilities for his actions.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.360
Isn't that what a good father is?

36:14.520 --> 36:18.440
She tried to put a condom on me.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.240
Why would she do that?

36:22.640 --> 36:25.040
So you cut her?

36:27.840 --> 36:29.800
I never had to do that before.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.320
Before?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.960
There were other women?

36:36.120 --> 36:38.000
<i>How many?</i>

36:41.720 --> 36:44.640
I wanna trust you.

36:49.520 --> 36:52.040
You'll make 12.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.360
You raped them to spread your seed?

36:58.520 --> 37:02.120
After they're pregnant,
they'll forgive me.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.680
The prostitutes, did you kill them?

37:07.840 --> 37:09.880
No. God, no.

37:10.040 --> 37:13.080
I spread life, not death.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.320
- Okay.
- So when can you and I consummate?

37:16.840 --> 37:19.960
- Oh, that's not gonna happen.
- You promised me something.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.880
You may have thought you heard that,
but I didn't say it.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.480
Yes, you did, right here.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.640
You promised me a baby.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.880
You give me that pussy!

37:34.040 --> 37:35.560
That's mine, damn it!

37:35.720 --> 37:38.720
- Give it to me now!
- Get off me!

37:41.440 --> 37:44.720
Oh, my balls.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.680
You all right?

37:47.840 --> 37:50.720
The bigger they are...

37:55.840 --> 37:58.160
- So no serial killer, huh?
- I don't know.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.560
If there is one, it wasn't him.

38:00.720 --> 38:03.880
- Heard about your gun bust. Nice.
- The wait for backup was...

38:04.040 --> 38:09.120
...the longest two minutes in my life.
- It always is. Still, you kept your cool.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.640
Aceveda wants me to take
the sergeant's exam.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.560
I suck at tests.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.360
I get so much grief for being a woman
in this place. I can't not pass.

38:20.520 --> 38:24.040
- It's not that hard.
- Oh, for you maybe.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.680
Hey, could you tutor me?

38:26.840 --> 38:29.840
I could dust off my old notes.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.880
- All right, get out.
- Get out?

38:38.040 --> 38:39.880
I don't even know where
the hell we are.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.680
- That's your problem.
- You're an asshole.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.560
Yeah? Well, that's my problem.

38:44.760 --> 38:48.040
- My lawyers are gonna make sure...
- You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.760
Your homeys are still in custody.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.760
One visit to the evidence room, and
that ounce of weed becomes a pound.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.720
Play any road games in San Quentin?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.960
- You done with me yet?
- Tell me something.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.600
Why would you risk everything,
slumming with those losers?

39:05.120 --> 39:07.920
They was my boys before I made it.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.680
Who else am I supposed to trust now?

39:11.840 --> 39:13.960
The fans?

39:14.640 --> 39:17.360
- You?
- Listen, if they were your boys...

39:17.520 --> 39:21.240
...you'd pull them up instead of letting
them drag you down.

39:24.760 --> 39:28.640
Take the subway three stops down
to the Staples Center.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.360
That's Derrick Tripp.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.640
Can I get your autograph?

39:40.120 --> 39:42.360
Isn't that that basketball player?

39:42.560 --> 39:45.080
Check him out, man.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.320
We certainly hate to lose you, Nathan.
It's the end of an era.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.360
I guess I just lost that edge.
Of course, I'll give two weeks.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.080
Not necessary, really.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.200
I need to train my replacement.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.760
I have a system tracking suspects
from processing to the cage that...

40:06.920 --> 40:09.960
Nathan, we'll manage...

40:12.520 --> 40:14.040
...somehow.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.440
Hey.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.640
I heard you gave sperm boy
a nice whack.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.280
I could use a good ass-kicker
on my squad.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.880
- Be careful.
- Hey, thanks.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.560
We wouldn't have gotten him
if it weren't for Dutch.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.640
Yeah, but you were the closer.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.840
You all right?

40:47.520 --> 40:49.600
Let's go.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.560
Hi.

41:13.720 --> 41:18.240
At the station, you implied
that I was gay.

41:20.120 --> 41:23.320
- Aren't you?
- No.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.560
I'm not.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.560
- I know what you mean.
- You do?

41:29.720 --> 41:31.560
Sure.

41:31.720 --> 41:36.840
I wasn't gay either, until the day
I just admitted that I was.

41:37.240 --> 41:41.040
It's okay. It's okay.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.840
It's safe.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.880
The class loves to paint.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.160
- Cleanup's always the problem.
- I've seen it.

41:57.320 --> 41:58.960
Thanks again for the art supplies.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.200
- I got them on sale.
- The kids had a ball.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.280
Excuse me, we're here
for a reason, right?

42:04.480 --> 42:07.920
Of course. Sit down.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.880
I'm concerned about Matthew.
He's not socializing properly.

42:18.040 --> 42:20.040
He's a little shy. He'll grow out of it.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.760
I'm afraid it's more
than just being shy.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.080
Matthew's way behind
the other children.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.440
So he's not Michelangelo. So what?

42:27.640 --> 42:31.240
What I'm trying to say is,
I think there's a problem.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.680
- What kind of problem?
- I can't tell you exactly.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.160
Well, who could tell us exactly?

42:36.320 --> 42:39.360
I think it's something that
a developmental paediatrician...

42:39.520 --> 42:41.920
...should diagnose.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.320
A neurologist, maybe.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.280
- Trampling New Jersey, 101 to 78...

42:49.440 --> 42:52.760
... clinching home- court advantage
throughout the playoffs for the Lak ers.

42:52.880 --> 42:57.120
Kobe Bryant had a game- high
35 points. Shaq chipped in with 29.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.560
Derrick Tripp was a no-show
after getting stuck in traffic...

43:00.720 --> 43:06.120
<i>... returning from a charity event.
Only in L.A.</i>
