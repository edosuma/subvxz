WEBVTT

00:01.823 --> 00:03.414
I really don't want anybody to know...

00:03.439 --> 00:05.667
about Jacob or that
I was in the hospital.

00:06.219 --> 00:09.580
Will you promise me that if
you ever feel suicidal again,

00:09.605 --> 00:11.433
that you... you'll just come to me.

00:11.983 --> 00:14.219
I haven't exactly
broken up with Jeff yet.

00:14.244 --> 00:15.469
What if you get him to dump you?

00:15.493 --> 00:17.777
Just tell him that you don't
want to move back to Wisconsin.

00:17.801 --> 00:18.812
I'll move to LA.

00:18.837 --> 00:20.414
But you love Fitchburg.

00:20.618 --> 00:22.101
I love you more.

00:23.522 --> 00:24.771
Can I stay with you tonight?

00:24.796 --> 00:25.971
Yeah.

00:26.174 --> 00:27.769
I think we should implement a rule

00:27.793 --> 00:30.035
that supervisors cannot date anyone

00:30.060 --> 00:31.143
who works under them.

00:31.168 --> 00:32.183
Agreed.

00:32.209 --> 00:33.992
_

00:34.017 --> 00:36.536
The app literally doubled the donations!

00:36.561 --> 00:38.721
We only made $10,000, not 20.

00:39.084 --> 00:41.193
- I met my father.
- How'd that go?

00:41.218 --> 00:42.898
We always thought that
he just up and left.

00:42.923 --> 00:44.856
My mom never said
anything good about him.

00:44.881 --> 00:46.414
Is everything okay?

00:46.439 --> 00:47.599
I'm being evicted.

00:48.323 --> 00:50.723
- You ever been in love?
- Once.

00:51.124 --> 00:52.604
His name was Elijah.

00:53.497 --> 00:55.806
I can't get a job
until I've passed the bar.

00:55.831 --> 00:57.951
Which I will hopefully know about soon.

00:59.591 --> 01:01.951
I didn't pass the bar.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.650
We don't do grassroots activism here.

01:07.675 --> 01:09.683
At Legal Aid, we're focused mostly

01:09.708 --> 01:11.928
on providing direct legal services

01:11.953 --> 01:13.180
to the local community.

01:19.512 --> 01:21.632
You wouldn't believe what
that woman has been through.

01:22.178 --> 01:24.130
This is Callie, your
new research assistant.

01:24.539 --> 01:25.691
Cary, Gwen.

01:25.716 --> 01:27.374
Hi, I'm Cary. So nice to meet you.

01:27.399 --> 01:28.565
Hi. Nice to meet you. Welcome.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.872
They're our paralegals.

01:29.897 --> 01:32.098
You'll be working for them
and all the lawyers here.

01:32.123 --> 01:34.349
Will you show Callie around,
give her the lay of the land?

01:34.373 --> 01:35.405
Of course.

01:35.430 --> 01:38.271
You are gorgeous.

01:38.435 --> 01:39.892
Is it okay to say that?

01:40.016 --> 01:41.682
Cary's new. Don't worry.

01:41.707 --> 01:44.258
The only person he wants
to harass around here is...

01:44.283 --> 01:45.382
Right behind you.

01:45.407 --> 01:46.473
Marcus.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.307
- Hey.
- This is Callie.

01:48.332 --> 01:49.732
She's our new research assistant.

01:49.757 --> 01:50.757
Oh, good.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.932
Can you check the LARSO
on this three-day notice?

01:58.284 --> 01:59.984
Uh, this is defective.

02:00.009 --> 02:02.245
It doesn't list the
outstanding rent owed

02:02.270 --> 02:03.510
or where to make payment.

02:04.206 --> 02:05.367
Where did you go to school?

02:05.392 --> 02:06.453
UCSD.

02:06.478 --> 02:08.078
- Legal studies?
- Law.

02:08.634 --> 02:09.817
You're a lawyer?

02:09.842 --> 02:10.842
Yes.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.651
I haven't passed the bar yet.

02:12.676 --> 02:14.168
Well, aren't you a little overqualified

02:14.192 --> 02:15.272
to be a research assistant?

02:16.516 --> 02:17.516
I need a job.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.799
Hm. Well, don't be tempted
to give legal advice.

02:22.353 --> 02:24.473
Oh, don't worry. I will stay in my lane.

02:26.943 --> 02:29.063
All right, back to work.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:39.130 --> 02:40.206
Okay.

02:40.533 --> 02:43.636
How about one that's a little l-less...

02:43.661 --> 02:44.661
Less?

02:44.826 --> 02:46.818
More... relaxed.

02:47.522 --> 02:48.854
Okay.

02:48.879 --> 02:50.031
- You ready?
- Yeah.

02:50.056 --> 02:51.866
What are you doing?
That is a terrible...

02:51.891 --> 02:53.229
- You're a fierce tiger.
- What are you do...

02:53.253 --> 02:54.893
- Please get up.
- You're a Komodo dragon.

03:02.345 --> 03:04.168
And I need a photographer, not a critic.

03:04.193 --> 03:05.262
Well, I'm not a photographer.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.169
Yeah, but you're tall, and
pictures look better from above.

03:07.193 --> 03:08.275
Come on. Let me see.

03:12.418 --> 03:13.826
I like that one.

03:13.851 --> 03:14.851
Ugh. No.

03:15.555 --> 03:17.606
Who invited the dinner
rolls to the party?

03:17.631 --> 03:18.631
You look like you.

03:19.409 --> 03:20.409
Thanks a lot.

03:21.266 --> 03:23.332
Beautiful. And real.

03:24.267 --> 03:26.304
Well, I appreciate the "beautiful" part,

03:26.756 --> 03:29.824
but no one wants to see anything
on Instagram that's too "real".

03:30.191 --> 03:31.391
Oh, this is the one.

03:33.402 --> 03:35.495
I thought the point of the
whole body-positive movement

03:35.519 --> 03:38.770
was to love your real
body, without filters.

03:38.795 --> 03:40.515
Okay, everyone uses filters.

03:40.951 --> 03:43.151
And I'm not trimming or slimming.

03:43.176 --> 03:45.628
Oh, speaking of which,
my mom's gonna be in town

03:45.653 --> 03:47.533
getting one of her "procedures".

03:48.829 --> 03:50.549
At least she's staying
in a hotel this time.

03:53.496 --> 03:55.404
You do remember my mom?

03:55.429 --> 03:56.549
Yeah.

03:56.574 --> 03:57.599
Why?

03:57.789 --> 04:00.109
No reason, you were just
pretty wasted last time.

04:12.822 --> 04:13.822
Good morning.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.590
_

04:58.942 --> 05:00.882
The place is so tiny.

05:01.899 --> 05:04.339
I don't know how you do it.

05:04.364 --> 05:06.664
Well, you could always stay in a hotel.

05:06.904 --> 05:08.928
I can't afford a hotel.

05:08.952 --> 05:11.729
Yeah, but you can afford
a brow lift or whatever?

05:11.754 --> 05:13.796
Doctor Levin has a payment plan.

05:13.821 --> 05:15.411
Mm-hmm? And what's the interest rate

05:15.427 --> 05:16.577
on this payment plan?

05:16.602 --> 05:17.968
Less than my credit card.

05:17.993 --> 05:21.033
And I would appreciate
a little support, Davia.

05:22.786 --> 05:24.786
Mom, you're a beautiful woman.

05:25.798 --> 05:27.051
I'm over 40,

05:27.208 --> 05:29.528
and single, with no
one to take care of me.

05:30.006 --> 05:31.806
Time's running out, okay?

05:32.069 --> 05:34.249
What, you want me to
end up old and alone?

05:35.423 --> 05:37.603
Mom, you're not gonna end up alone.

05:39.154 --> 05:40.434
You'll always have me.

05:40.946 --> 05:43.806
I know. And I love you so much.

05:44.156 --> 05:45.696
But I can't have sex with you.

05:48.054 --> 05:50.664
Don't you want to find someone

05:50.689 --> 05:52.287
who loves you for what's inside?

05:53.411 --> 05:55.196
Honey, men aren't
interested in the inside

05:55.221 --> 05:57.661
if what's on the outside
doesn't give them a boner.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.951
I got you something.

06:01.025 --> 06:02.774
For my baby girl.

06:02.799 --> 06:04.156
Mm-hmm.

06:04.181 --> 06:05.701
Do you like it?

06:05.931 --> 06:07.714
- It's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.157 --> 06:10.499
And... expensive.

06:10.524 --> 06:11.724
You're welcome.

06:13.914 --> 06:14.955
Thank you.

06:17.256 --> 06:19.501
Oh, my goodness. You are so pretty.

06:19.526 --> 06:20.926
Oh!

06:20.951 --> 06:22.551
And talented.

06:22.971 --> 06:24.696
Look at that gorgeous face.

06:24.721 --> 06:25.855
Mm.

06:25.987 --> 06:28.103
If you just lost 30 pounds,

06:28.128 --> 06:30.212
you could get any man you want.

06:30.237 --> 06:31.237
Muah.

06:39.151 --> 06:42.103
There she is. Congratulations.

06:42.128 --> 06:45.140
- You did it, girl!
- And she raised $20,000.

06:45.165 --> 06:47.568
- You made us proud.
- Her app is genius.

06:47.593 --> 06:48.859
Thank you, all.

06:48.884 --> 06:50.093
So, are you excited?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.961
We heard Evan was there.
He must be impressed.

06:56.672 --> 06:58.533
I think I'm just gonna
tell Evan what happened

06:58.558 --> 07:00.704
and have him garnish my wages,
so no one needs to know.

07:00.728 --> 07:01.768
Whoa, wait.

07:02.393 --> 07:04.020
You don't have to make up that money.

07:04.045 --> 07:07.229
The Center for Transgender
Veterans is expecting $20,000.

07:07.254 --> 07:08.579
They were expecting half that.

07:08.604 --> 07:09.652
They'll understand.

07:09.677 --> 07:11.397
Yeah, well, what about everyone else?

07:11.422 --> 07:13.755
It's a beta test. Things
are supposed to go wrong.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.246
Okay. No, not on my watch.

07:15.504 --> 07:18.839
I mean, all of those guys
are expecting me to fail.

07:18.864 --> 07:20.404
And Evan stood up to
his board of directors.

07:20.416 --> 07:22.044
I can't let him lose his faith in me.

07:22.069 --> 07:24.549
I don't think you have to worry
about Evan losing faith in you.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.963
Oh, my god. Do you still
think that he's doing

07:27.988 --> 07:30.208
- all of this because...
- No, I didn't say that.

07:30.225 --> 07:32.194
- Well, that's what you're implying.
- No, it's not.

07:32.205 --> 07:33.839
Look, I can't talk about this right now.

07:33.863 --> 07:36.643
I don't have time for this. I have
to go down to the art department,

07:36.668 --> 07:38.428
and then I have a
stupid grievance meeting.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.868
_

07:51.673 --> 07:53.673
_

07:53.697 --> 07:55.697
_

07:59.336 --> 08:00.436
_

08:00.460 --> 08:02.460
_

08:10.193 --> 08:11.433
Miss me?

08:12.255 --> 08:13.555
What's his story?

08:14.371 --> 08:15.640
- Oh, Dennis?
- Yeah.

08:15.664 --> 08:18.182
- He lives at the Coterie.
- Hm. What does he do?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.923
Well, you're looking at it.

08:19.948 --> 08:21.397
He must have a job.

08:21.422 --> 08:22.662
Not that I know of.

08:23.247 --> 08:25.214
But he just moved in,
so I barely know him.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.731
Well, maybe you should get to know him.

08:26.755 --> 08:28.321
He's very attractive.

08:28.346 --> 08:30.038
Yeah, no thanks.

08:30.063 --> 08:31.254
That guy's a loser.

08:31.279 --> 08:32.895
Every man's a loser

08:32.921 --> 08:34.798
until he finds the right woman.

08:34.823 --> 08:36.273
Oh, thank you.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.655
Hey, can you send Dennis

08:37.681 --> 08:39.100
a refill of whatever he's drinking?

08:39.125 --> 08:40.957
- And say it's from Davia.
- Mom, no.

08:40.982 --> 08:43.203
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Do it,
do it, do it, do it, do it. Yeah.

08:43.227 --> 08:45.207
Okay, what about his date?

08:45.643 --> 08:47.203
Well, she can get her own drink.

08:59.253 --> 09:00.253
Hmm.

09:07.842 --> 09:08.842
Hey, guys.

09:11.495 --> 09:13.035
Are you and Raj dating?

09:18.741 --> 09:21.261
Is that why you chose Raj to be
on your team instead of a woman?

09:21.286 --> 09:23.778
No. No, I-I chose Raj

09:23.803 --> 09:25.395
because he's an excellent engineer.

09:25.420 --> 09:28.165
People might think they got
passed over because you're dating.

09:28.190 --> 09:30.165
Like me, for instance.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.149
You're the reason that Evan fired Josh.

09:33.174 --> 09:35.700
If any of the guys find out
that you're dating someone

09:35.725 --> 09:37.503
on your team, they're
gonna rip you apart.

09:37.528 --> 09:40.229
All of us. It could undermine
everything we're working for.

09:40.254 --> 09:41.500
As head of the grievance committee,

09:41.524 --> 09:42.607
you either need to break up with Raj

09:42.631 --> 09:44.271
or take him off your team.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.610
I think they're right.

09:57.705 --> 09:59.465
- There you go.
- Thank you.

10:00.825 --> 10:02.345
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.234
I heard you took that 5G workshop.

10:04.235 --> 10:06.397
You wanna grab drinks later so
I can pick your brain about it?

10:06.421 --> 10:07.741
Sure, man.

10:16.438 --> 10:17.678
Hey, man.

10:20.950 --> 10:21.950
Hey.

10:23.311 --> 10:25.387
Uh, can I get a double chai latte?

10:25.412 --> 10:26.652
Coming right up.

10:26.677 --> 10:29.017
Very pleased with the
way the app is going.

10:30.813 --> 10:31.813
Yeah.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.723
Would you mind if we spoke in private?

10:45.671 --> 10:47.065
I need a declaration

10:47.090 --> 10:49.094
to complete this petition for dismissal.

10:49.119 --> 10:50.672
- Good morning.
- I said, "Good morning".

10:50.696 --> 10:52.730
No, you didn't. Good morning.

10:52.755 --> 10:54.638
Would you mind cite-checking
this motion for me?

10:54.663 --> 10:55.663
Sure.

10:57.329 --> 10:59.409
- My declaration?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

11:04.129 --> 11:05.129
What's this?

11:05.531 --> 11:07.971
A vanilla latte. For you.

11:08.351 --> 11:10.151
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:10.316 --> 11:12.336
I just need that declaration.

11:14.918 --> 11:17.398
He's not in yet. Everything okay?

11:17.876 --> 11:18.876
Yeah.

11:20.522 --> 11:23.656
Callie, this is my father, Joseph.

11:24.876 --> 11:26.036
He's being evicted.

11:27.356 --> 11:28.596
I think because of us.

11:30.405 --> 11:33.514
They can't evict you for making
a complaint about maintenance.

11:35.163 --> 11:36.463
I'm behind on my rent.

11:37.471 --> 11:39.770
I ran into some medical
bills a few months ago.

11:39.795 --> 11:41.621
The landlord was letting me stay

11:41.623 --> 11:43.676
in exchange for doing
odd jobs around the place.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.669
But then he accused me of snitching

11:45.694 --> 11:47.244
about the broken elevator

11:47.269 --> 11:48.979
and gave me 24 hours to get out.

11:49.004 --> 11:50.844
I'm so sorry, Joseph.

11:51.948 --> 11:55.028
But don't worry. I'll get someone
from my office to fix this.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.272
Good morning, Marcus.

11:58.297 --> 11:59.817
- Hey, Marcus.
- Morning.

12:00.117 --> 12:01.411
Uh, Marcus, can I talk to you?

12:01.436 --> 12:03.256
Yes. Make it quick. I have a client.

12:03.281 --> 12:06.833
I wanted to talk to you
about that demand letter.

12:06.858 --> 12:08.108
What demand letter is that?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.750
Uh, the one you told
me to serve on the...

12:09.771 --> 12:12.171
Towers on Western
single residency hotel.

12:12.196 --> 12:14.656
Elevator's been out for weeks,
and management keeps saying

12:14.681 --> 12:16.567
they're gonna fix it and they don't.

12:16.592 --> 12:18.112
I was wondering what can be done.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.735
Well, we would serve a demand letter

12:19.760 --> 12:22.205
saying that they have 48
hours to address the problem.

12:22.230 --> 12:23.647
Otherwise, they're in breach,

12:23.672 --> 12:25.832
and they could lose
their license to operate.

12:28.068 --> 12:29.068
Okay.

12:30.039 --> 12:31.279
I know what to do.

12:33.532 --> 12:35.532
What I don't understand is

12:35.557 --> 12:37.298
how the manager knew Joseph had anything

12:37.323 --> 12:39.031
to do with the demand letter?

12:39.056 --> 12:40.376
I didn't put his name on it.

12:42.086 --> 12:43.286
I think that's on me.

12:45.906 --> 12:47.406
Selina, you okay?

12:48.927 --> 12:50.562
The elevator's still broken.

12:50.587 --> 12:52.587
Yeah, I can't do my shopping.

12:57.814 --> 13:00.489
No man has carried me like this

13:00.514 --> 13:03.556
since my husband carried
me across the threshold.

13:05.503 --> 13:07.503
God rest his rotten heart.

13:07.528 --> 13:08.688
Oh.

13:12.864 --> 13:13.864
Okay.

13:15.814 --> 13:17.574
Alright. I'll go get
your wheelchair, huh?

13:17.599 --> 13:18.701
Just hang tight.

13:18.726 --> 13:20.476
What else could I do?

13:21.599 --> 13:22.839
Here you go.

13:24.215 --> 13:25.889
So, how long has the elevator been out?

13:25.922 --> 13:27.047
A while.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.056
They keep saying they're
gonna fix it, but...

13:29.081 --> 13:30.634
in the meantime, people like Selina

13:30.659 --> 13:31.779
are trapped on their floors.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.619
That's not right. There's
gotta be something they can do.

13:34.901 --> 13:35.958
Well, we'll manage.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.663
Well...

13:38.277 --> 13:39.877
I'd like to see you again sometime.

13:40.218 --> 13:41.218
If it suits you.

13:42.761 --> 13:44.721
- Yeah. I'd, I'd like that, too.
- Yeah.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.448
I'm gonna die soon.

14:03.857 --> 14:06.316
Oh, no. Don't you bet on it, Selina.

14:06.341 --> 14:08.372
You're gonna outlive us all.

14:17.216 --> 14:18.216
Excuse me.

14:19.152 --> 14:21.272
Can I ask when you plan
on fixing the elevator?

14:21.297 --> 14:23.016
Who the hell are you?
You don't live here.

14:23.466 --> 14:24.701
My father does.

14:24.896 --> 14:26.513
And the tenants who can't use the stairs

14:26.538 --> 14:27.624
are stuck on their floors.

14:27.821 --> 14:29.061
It's none of your business.

14:30.518 --> 14:32.758
Then I'll take it to someone
whose business it is.

14:33.860 --> 14:35.937
You served a demand letter?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.771
That's what you said we do...

14:37.796 --> 14:40.036
We, as in one of the licensed lawyers.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.880
I guess I misunderstood.

14:44.708 --> 14:45.948
Is that it?

14:46.589 --> 14:48.213
No. Um,

14:48.238 --> 14:49.814
there's a problem.

14:49.839 --> 14:53.031
The tenant on whose
behalf I served the letter

14:53.060 --> 14:54.940
is being evicted in retaliation.

14:55.522 --> 14:56.904
They can't do that.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.089
Well, he's behind on rent.

14:58.906 --> 15:01.541
And he's the father of a friend of mine,

15:01.566 --> 15:04.826
so I feel like this is sort of my fault.

15:04.851 --> 15:06.410
Yeah. Ya think?

15:07.565 --> 15:08.865
Is there something we...

15:09.582 --> 15:11.307
you can do to help him?

15:11.332 --> 15:14.349
Maybe. But I can't do anything
without looping in Teresa.

15:15.221 --> 15:18.241
And if I do that, your first
week here might be your last.

15:25.548 --> 15:27.415
So, I made a mistake.

15:32.889 --> 15:35.015
There was a... glitch

15:35.040 --> 15:36.880
- in the beta test...
- Raj told me.

15:39.137 --> 15:40.782
What exactly did he tell you?

15:40.807 --> 15:43.247
That it doubled the amount of
donations, and it was his fault.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.186
No, i-it was my fault.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.581
I-it was in the original code.

15:47.606 --> 15:49.275
He was just trying to fix it on the fly.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.766
He asked me to garnish his
wages to make up the extra money.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.318
That's what I was gonna ask you to do,

15:53.343 --> 15:54.951
t-to my wages.

15:54.976 --> 15:57.133
I'm the team leader.
It's my responsibility.

15:58.774 --> 15:59.974
I'm the company leader.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.344
The ultimate responsibility is mine.

16:04.081 --> 16:05.701
So, I will make up the $10,000.

16:06.369 --> 16:08.288
No, I... I can't let you do that.

16:08.786 --> 16:11.820
I'm rich, Mariana. $10,000
to me is like $10 to you.

16:13.739 --> 16:17.289
Uh, I mean... I'm assuming.

16:17.534 --> 16:18.774
Until I win the lottery.

16:19.827 --> 16:22.588
The odds of you winning the
lottery are practically nonexistent.

16:25.331 --> 16:28.606
Well, what about your
board of directors?

16:28.631 --> 16:30.751
I'm happy to tell them the
app was a complete success.

16:31.389 --> 16:34.129
Because otherwise, it, it was.

16:37.248 --> 16:38.288
Thank you.

16:39.656 --> 16:40.896
You're an amazing boss.

16:43.593 --> 16:44.593
Collaborator.

16:45.288 --> 16:46.588
There are no bosses here.

16:52.334 --> 16:53.578
I am so sorry.

16:53.603 --> 16:55.843
I just wanted to help.

16:56.031 --> 16:58.447
Can I ask how much you owe?

16:59.076 --> 17:00.456
Around $800.

17:01.334 --> 17:02.574
I can loan you the money.

17:03.145 --> 17:04.798
I'm not taking money from my daughter.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.258
I didn't mean to make
a thing out of this.

17:06.281 --> 17:07.453
I just needed to know what happened.

17:07.477 --> 17:09.346
Yeah, but this is my fault.

17:09.371 --> 17:11.299
Please, let me make it right.

17:11.324 --> 17:12.324
No.

17:20.262 --> 17:22.023
I wasn't in your life all these years.

17:22.049 --> 17:25.009
Didn't want to bring any trouble
on you or your mom or your brother.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.087
You were probably better off not
coming to see me in the first place.

17:31.849 --> 17:33.689
Thanks for the tea.

17:58.764 --> 18:00.624
Can I talk to you for a moment?

18:01.366 --> 18:02.957
So, not to rub it in your face,

18:03.451 --> 18:05.296
but the photo that I
chose for my Insta got

18:05.321 --> 18:06.921
over a thousand likes so far.

18:08.806 --> 18:10.046
Congratulations.

18:10.887 --> 18:11.967
What's going on there?

18:13.313 --> 18:14.813
Uh, just something to do.

18:15.944 --> 18:18.153
Well, I have something for you to do.

18:19.816 --> 18:21.776
Do you want to go to
dinner with me and my mom?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.148
Tell ya, you, you remind me of the boys

18:26.173 --> 18:28.115
I used to date in high school.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.250
Oh, yeah, speaking of high school,

18:30.275 --> 18:31.655
what grade is Misty in?

18:32.262 --> 18:34.813
Says the person out on a
Saturday night with her mother.

18:34.838 --> 18:36.271
Snap.

18:36.296 --> 18:37.504
Who says "snap"?

18:37.814 --> 18:39.314
You two, get a room already.

18:39.339 --> 18:40.499
You all good here?

18:40.983 --> 18:42.703
We'll do one more round, on me.

18:42.728 --> 18:45.004
We have that party to go to.

18:45.029 --> 18:46.711
Ooh, was there gonna be a bouncy house?

18:48.399 --> 18:49.594
One more drink. Come on.

18:49.619 --> 18:51.914
I'm going. You can meet me there...

18:51.939 --> 18:53.179
or not.

18:54.170 --> 18:55.480
- Uhh...
- Yikes.

18:55.505 --> 18:56.945
- Rude.
- Not good.

18:57.305 --> 19:00.373
See? That is the problem
with dating younger women.

19:00.398 --> 19:02.032
They're all about the drama.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.343
Uh, since he's buying,
I'm gonna have a margarita

19:04.368 --> 19:05.768
with your most expensive tequila.

19:05.793 --> 19:07.326
Okay, make it a skinny.

19:07.351 --> 19:10.438
You should've seen the
body my baby used to have.

19:10.463 --> 19:11.763
Oh, when I was anorexic?

19:13.143 --> 19:15.820
No. Before that, Davia.

19:15.845 --> 19:18.745
Jeez. Talk about drama.

19:18.770 --> 19:20.879
I mean, as long as you're
not starving yourself,

19:20.904 --> 19:23.562
you can never be too rich or too thin.

19:23.587 --> 19:24.714
Am I right?

19:27.099 --> 19:31.227
Yeah, I'm not really up for
being around people right now.

19:31.252 --> 19:33.492
I know. I told her you wouldn't come.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.346
Plus, we're meeting early
because of her surgery

19:36.367 --> 19:37.975
so that's why I'm eating now.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.340
You're not gonna eat with her?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.063
Well, I'll get, like, a little salad.

19:43.088 --> 19:44.940
But otherwise, I have
to endure my mother's

19:44.943 --> 19:46.869
well-meaning remarks
about how I could get a man

19:46.894 --> 19:48.051
if I just wasn't so fat.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.883
That's for being
chivalrous as my boyfriend.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.114
And that's for going behind
my back as team leader.

20:03.562 --> 20:04.682
I'm sorry.

20:05.612 --> 20:06.812
It's okay.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.381
Evan's gonna cover the
1OK out of his own pocket.

20:10.238 --> 20:11.238
Seriously?

20:11.758 --> 20:14.975
Yeah. Because, ultimately,
it's his responsibility.

20:14.984 --> 20:15.984
According to him.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.551
And he's rich. Also according to him.

20:18.986 --> 20:21.003
And I swear, if you read into this

20:21.028 --> 20:22.868
- in any way, I will...
- What?

20:23.525 --> 20:25.325
Fire me?

20:39.334 --> 20:40.334
That's him.

20:45.631 --> 20:49.015
I have a work order to
fix the elevator, okay?

20:49.124 --> 20:51.190
I'm representing Joseph Turner.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.086
Did you give him a 30-day
written notice of eviction?

20:54.111 --> 20:56.464
Come on. He's 60 days
past due on his rent.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.587
I don't care if he's 60 years past due.

20:58.612 --> 20:59.636
That's the law.

20:59.661 --> 21:01.754
And it's illegal for
a landlord to retaliate

21:01.779 --> 21:03.620
against a tenant who has exercised

21:03.645 --> 21:05.079
his legal right to complain

21:05.104 --> 21:07.444
about a violation of safety laws.

21:07.844 --> 21:10.064
Like failure to repair an elevator.

21:10.198 --> 21:12.898
So, if you try to throw Mr. Turner out

21:12.923 --> 21:15.065
before the 30 days, we'll sue.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.825
Yeah, but if he doesn't pay before then,

21:16.850 --> 21:18.090
he's outta here.

21:20.159 --> 21:21.542
What's this?

21:21.567 --> 21:22.775
A new demand order.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.240
This one's signed by a judge.

21:24.456 --> 21:26.663
You have 48 hours to repair the elevator

21:26.688 --> 21:29.128
or you'll lose your license
to operate the facility.

21:35.075 --> 21:36.811
We bought your friend's
father some time,

21:36.836 --> 21:39.069
but if he doesn't pay,
he'll be out on the street.

21:39.094 --> 21:41.078
Thank you so much. I'm
so grateful for your help.

21:41.103 --> 21:42.903
Don't be grateful. Just don't screw up.

21:43.524 --> 21:45.015
You have a law degree, Callie.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.715
I'm assuming you actually earned it.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.397
So, think next time.

21:56.381 --> 21:59.550
So, is the chicken cooked
with olive oil or butter?

21:59.575 --> 22:01.112
You know what? Just
bring me a kale salad.

22:01.136 --> 22:02.776
And then another vodka rocks.

22:02.801 --> 22:04.281
I'll just have the kale salad, too.

22:05.651 --> 22:07.985
Are you allowed to drink
before you have major surgery?

22:08.010 --> 22:09.379
I'm getting my eyes done, Davia.

22:09.404 --> 22:11.044
It's not major surgery.

22:12.723 --> 22:16.333
So... Jeff left his wife.

22:17.813 --> 22:20.913
- How do you know about that?
- It's the talk of Fitchburg.

22:21.276 --> 22:23.994
Mainly because Lily's mom is
telling anyone who'll listen

22:24.019 --> 22:25.069
that Jeff is a monster.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.394
Well, he's not a monster.

22:27.307 --> 22:28.507
No judgment here.

22:29.321 --> 22:31.747
I mean, you've been in love
with that boy since high school.

22:31.772 --> 22:34.339
And clearly, he loves you, too,

22:34.364 --> 22:37.004
for what's on the inside, like you said.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.720
Do you know how rare that is?

22:39.990 --> 22:42.550
And you, you found the one.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.473
Well, um, actually, he's...

22:45.924 --> 22:48.216
not... the one.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.160
What do you mean?

22:53.291 --> 22:55.651
I'm not in love with Jeff anymore.

22:57.034 --> 22:59.676
Does he know this?

22:59.701 --> 23:01.201
No. Not yet.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.384
He's, he's just having
such a hard time, you know,

23:04.409 --> 23:05.889
with Lily and then his family.

23:05.914 --> 23:07.249
Everybody's mad at him.

23:07.274 --> 23:11.360
Davia, you better think
long and hard about this.

23:11.512 --> 23:13.964
You found a good man who wants you.

23:13.989 --> 23:16.199
And take it from me, the
pickings are slim out there,

23:16.224 --> 23:18.805
even for the size twos of the world.

23:18.876 --> 23:21.471
Don't do something you're
gonna regret in ten years,

23:21.496 --> 23:22.723
when you're still single

23:22.747 --> 23:24.907
and your biological clock is ticking.

23:26.734 --> 23:27.974
That's all I'm saying.

23:49.644 --> 23:51.122
Okay, 'kay, 'kay. Come, come, come.

23:51.146 --> 23:52.146
Davia, chin up and out.

23:53.987 --> 23:58.339
Ooh! This is gonna be so cute
on my Insta story, Twitter.

23:59.894 --> 24:03.319
- Look at Misty. She is mad at me.
- Oh, yeah, she is.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.544
See, I told you.

24:06.569 --> 24:09.262
Younger women are all about the drama.

24:09.287 --> 24:12.038
- Last call?
- Mm. Thank God. Let's bounce.

24:12.063 --> 24:15.963
Oh, one more drink, with
the woman who birthed you.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.665
She was nine pounds, ten ounces.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.726
And she just tore me
to shreds down there.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.316
Wow.

24:22.389 --> 24:24.233
But don't worry. I'm tight
as a drum now.

24:24.258 --> 24:27.185
Yeah. Mom, no one's worried
about your vagina. Let's go.

24:27.210 --> 24:29.602
Oh, come on. I never
get to have any fun.

24:29.708 --> 24:32.208
Will you stay and have
one last drink with me?

24:32.233 --> 24:34.643
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

24:34.668 --> 24:37.009
Well, you two senior
citizens can have fun.

24:37.034 --> 24:38.533
I'm going home and going to bed.

24:38.558 --> 24:40.302
Will you make sure
that they get back okay?

24:40.327 --> 24:41.852
Yeah. No problem.

24:41.877 --> 24:43.757
- Thank you.
- I love you.

24:44.135 --> 24:46.311
Ooh, okay. So...

24:46.739 --> 24:49.498
tell me all about you.

24:51.882 --> 24:53.242
I want to know everything.

25:11.590 --> 25:12.590
Hey.

25:14.066 --> 25:15.306
Got a minute?

25:15.571 --> 25:16.962
'Bout all I got these days.

25:20.412 --> 25:21.612
Look, I understand,

25:22.993 --> 25:25.033
not wanting to take
your daughter's money.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.088
But there's no reason why you
can't take a loan from me.

25:29.113 --> 25:30.246
No, no. I can't do that.

25:30.271 --> 25:32.485
This is killing Malika that
she put you in this situation

25:32.509 --> 25:33.535
and she can't fix it.

25:34.911 --> 25:37.071
Uh, you said you haven't
been there for her for years.

25:37.455 --> 25:39.247
Well, if you want to
be there for her now,

25:39.272 --> 25:40.580
you'll take this money,

25:40.605 --> 25:42.165
and you'll lift the burden off of her.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.319
I know, it's...

25:53.203 --> 25:54.686
I'm paying you back every cent.

25:54.711 --> 25:56.351
Yeah, you damn right you are.

26:01.988 --> 26:03.068
And can you, uh...

26:03.859 --> 26:05.159
keep this between us?

26:07.185 --> 26:08.185
For sure.

26:09.326 --> 26:10.326
Take care, man.

26:19.074 --> 26:20.773
This isn't a convenient way

26:20.798 --> 26:22.634
to get rid of me after I messed up?

26:22.915 --> 26:23.915
No.

26:24.428 --> 26:26.468
I hate this. It's just...

26:27.191 --> 26:28.924
the rule of team leaders

26:28.949 --> 26:31.249
not being able to date people under them

26:31.760 --> 26:34.880
mostly protects women against
the Joshes of the world.

26:35.268 --> 26:36.802
And I can't be selfish.

26:37.316 --> 26:39.317
Even though I really want to be.

26:41.296 --> 26:42.296
I know.

26:44.415 --> 26:46.342
So, what are we gonna tell people

26:46.367 --> 26:48.127
is the reason I'm no
longer on your team?

26:48.804 --> 26:51.406
Well, it's no one's business.

26:51.603 --> 26:52.994
People are gonna talk.

26:53.019 --> 26:54.615
Yeah, well, people are really gonna talk

26:54.639 --> 26:55.950
if they find out we're dating.

26:55.975 --> 26:58.295
Especially Alex and Sam.

27:02.623 --> 27:05.222
I mean, we could tell them.

27:08.454 --> 27:10.521
No. No, we can't. You're right.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.306
And you would get the worst of it.

27:15.084 --> 27:17.124
I'm gonna miss working with you so much.

27:18.365 --> 27:20.374
Especially the late nights in my office.

27:22.798 --> 27:24.678
I'm available for late nights anytime.

27:26.347 --> 27:29.727
And hey, I don't want
you to worry about Evan.

27:29.825 --> 27:33.068
If he ever crossed a line,
which he hasn't and he won't,

27:34.080 --> 27:35.880
trust that I would
shoot it down right away.

27:37.776 --> 27:38.776
I do.

27:45.596 --> 27:47.281
So, I saw your latest Insta post.

27:47.306 --> 27:49.241
Oh! It got over a thousand likes.

27:49.266 --> 27:51.386
Yeah. Okay, I have a question.

27:52.123 --> 27:54.698
Are these body-positive people

27:54.723 --> 27:57.741
really proud of their plus-size selves,

27:57.766 --> 28:00.161
or are they just, you know, pretending

28:00.186 --> 28:03.220
to be to justify overeating

28:03.245 --> 28:05.365
and, you know, just being unhealthy?

28:05.390 --> 28:07.200
We're really proud of our bodies, Mom.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.994
And just because you're plus-size

28:09.019 --> 28:10.299
doesn't mean you're not healthy.

28:11.369 --> 28:12.909
Well, I don't buy that.

28:16.509 --> 28:17.978
- Dennis!
- Hi.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.837
You said he wasn't coming.

28:19.862 --> 28:21.445
Sorry. I'm late.

28:22.182 --> 28:24.201
Oh, good. Come sit.
Let's get you a drink.

28:24.226 --> 28:26.635
Oh, actually, I'm not really
drinking at the moment.

28:26.660 --> 28:27.877
Oh, that's no fun.

28:27.902 --> 28:29.494
- One drink, come on.
- Mom.

28:29.519 --> 28:30.618
What?

28:30.643 --> 28:31.951
He said he's not drinking.

28:31.976 --> 28:33.509
Yeah. I am, however, starving.

28:33.534 --> 28:34.814
Thank you very much.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.741
Ooh, all right.

28:36.766 --> 28:38.916
One of each small plate for the table,

28:38.941 --> 28:40.994
and two orders of those
fried artichokes you love.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.619
Bonnie? Do not tell me

28:42.644 --> 28:43.656
you're just having a salad.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.000
Well, I'm watching my figure.

28:46.232 --> 28:48.067
Well, you're too skinny, if you ask me.

28:48.331 --> 28:50.411
And let's have some of those
sweet potato fries, too.

28:50.553 --> 28:51.553
Thank you.

28:52.534 --> 28:53.534
Hey, y'all.

28:55.154 --> 28:57.687
Oh, hey. Uh, you remember my mother?

28:59.053 --> 29:00.773
- I sure do.
- Hi.

29:02.163 --> 29:03.403
But who's this guy?

29:06.194 --> 29:07.434
Where you been?

29:08.922 --> 29:09.922
Around.

29:11.604 --> 29:12.787
Mm.

29:12.812 --> 29:14.771
Well, I'll have the waiter bring out

29:14.796 --> 29:16.890
an order of those
fried artichokes on me.

29:17.163 --> 29:18.499
I know how much you love them.

29:21.868 --> 29:22.868
Mm.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Hey.

29:31.255 --> 29:32.255
Hey.

29:34.353 --> 29:35.353
How'd it go?

29:36.832 --> 29:37.832
He took the money.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.728
I don't feel great
telling him it was mine,

29:43.946 --> 29:45.177
although it could've been.

29:45.587 --> 29:46.770
No.

29:47.016 --> 29:49.556
You're not putting your
money on the line for my dad.

29:49.771 --> 29:51.291
What if he can't pay you back?

29:51.705 --> 29:53.986
Or what if he needs
money again next month?

29:54.631 --> 29:57.031
Now, I know your savings took
a hit with that eight hundred.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.784
But are you gonna
feel obligated to help?

29:58.809 --> 30:01.049
No, 'cause next month won't be my fault.

30:03.058 --> 30:04.058
Okay.

30:05.459 --> 30:06.459
Just be careful.

30:07.368 --> 30:08.851
He is a grown-ass man.

30:09.039 --> 30:10.434
He has been taking care of himself

30:10.459 --> 30:11.878
long before you were in the picture.

30:11.902 --> 30:13.362
I understand you want a
relationship with him, but...

30:13.386 --> 30:14.892
Yeah, but he doesn't want one with me.

30:14.916 --> 30:16.425
So, don't worry.

30:16.891 --> 30:18.502
Besides, I gotta get right with Dom.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.050
Probably can't do that
with our dad in the picture.

30:21.075 --> 30:22.259
I'm just saying.

30:22.687 --> 30:25.471
If he comes back around,
don't go try fixing his life.

30:25.496 --> 30:26.936
Let him be there for you

30:27.644 --> 30:29.104
and not the other way around.

30:32.515 --> 30:33.515
Okay.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.300
I'm good.

30:38.325 --> 30:40.916
You are still in the doghouse

30:40.941 --> 30:43.020
for not following me back on Instagram.

30:43.045 --> 30:45.470
Oh, I'm not really on
social media these days.

30:45.495 --> 30:46.682
No, no, no. I'm good. I'm good.

30:46.706 --> 30:48.209
Come on, you love these.

30:48.717 --> 30:50.417
Oh. Bonnie?

30:50.798 --> 30:51.998
Help me out with these.

30:53.008 --> 30:54.266
Oh, okay.

30:57.693 --> 31:00.050
Mmm. It's very, very fried.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.075
And delicious.

31:01.575 --> 31:02.650
Mm-hmm.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.655
I love a woman who's not afraid to eat.

31:05.084 --> 31:07.262
Oh, Davia and I were just discussing

31:07.287 --> 31:09.345
the whole body-positive thing.

31:09.581 --> 31:10.821
What do you make of it?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.780
I think it's great to see anyone
proud of the skin they're in.

31:13.804 --> 31:15.899
Oh. But would you ever date a woman

31:15.924 --> 31:17.164
who was plus-size?

31:17.725 --> 31:18.799
Sure.

31:19.018 --> 31:20.943
Have you ever dated anyone

31:20.968 --> 31:22.987
who was over, say, a size two?

31:23.012 --> 31:25.313
I don't really know women's sizes.

31:25.338 --> 31:28.305
Okay, a woman who
couldn't fit in your jeans?

31:30.946 --> 31:32.730
See?

31:32.755 --> 31:35.630
People say they'd do a
lot of things in theory,

31:35.655 --> 31:37.496
but it's what they do in practice

31:37.521 --> 31:39.761
that tells the real truth.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.676
I have to use the restroom.

32:10.886 --> 32:12.926
You never called me either, Dennis.

32:14.414 --> 32:15.734
You know, I was really messed up.

32:16.493 --> 32:18.293
I don't remember
anything from that night.

32:19.211 --> 32:20.711
Well, that's a shame.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.207
'Cause maybe if you did,
you wouldn't be chasing

32:24.232 --> 32:25.958
these little girls around.

32:26.208 --> 32:29.389
You'd remember what it's
like to be with a real woman.

32:30.163 --> 32:31.483
And I can...

32:32.636 --> 32:33.876
always remind you.

32:36.101 --> 32:37.841
I'm at the McCadden Hotel.

32:38.226 --> 32:39.466
Room 605.

32:51.214 --> 32:52.454
Is everything okay?

32:53.021 --> 32:55.204
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

33:05.769 --> 33:06.849
Davia.

33:18.103 --> 33:20.023
Go away!

33:31.443 --> 33:33.493
- I said, "Go away".
- Well, if you really wanted me to go away,

33:33.517 --> 33:35.629
- you would've locked the door.
- Oh, don't flatter yourself.

33:35.653 --> 33:36.653
I never lock my door.

33:37.734 --> 33:38.974
I'll go away,

33:39.579 --> 33:41.979
if you tell me who you're
mad at. Me or your mom?

33:42.560 --> 33:45.580
Both. I told you I don't
eat in front of my mother.

33:45.764 --> 33:48.798
And that's messed up. Uh,
you, you should be yourself.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.080
That is not for you to decide.

33:51.506 --> 33:52.681
Or to judge.

33:52.706 --> 33:54.417
Especially when you go around hiding

33:54.429 --> 33:55.869
who you are all the time.

33:57.916 --> 33:59.777
You don't get to tell
me to keep your secrets

33:59.802 --> 34:01.813
and then force me into
some sort of confrontation

34:01.838 --> 34:03.078
with my mother.

34:04.179 --> 34:05.739
I mean, look at me, Dennis.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.911
She knows I actually eat.

34:13.808 --> 34:15.860
I don't want to be
myself around my mother

34:15.885 --> 34:17.085
because it hurts.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.498
I'm sorry.

34:23.034 --> 34:24.674
It's just, I care about you,

34:24.699 --> 34:26.460
and she's got no right to judge.

34:26.485 --> 34:27.810
Oh.

34:27.828 --> 34:29.148
You think I don't know that?

34:31.248 --> 34:33.967
You think I, I don't
wish that she could just...

34:34.545 --> 34:35.746
see me...

34:37.250 --> 34:41.335
and not how I look or what I eat?

34:42.550 --> 34:44.951
She's the most insecure,

34:44.976 --> 34:47.243
self-loathing person I've ever known,

34:47.268 --> 34:50.108
and she's projected
that on me my whole life.

34:51.415 --> 34:53.255
Which is why I became anorexic.

34:53.853 --> 34:56.674
And by the way, you can be too skinny.

34:56.954 --> 34:58.554
Okay, I was 90 pounds.

34:59.651 --> 35:01.134
I had to go into a hospital,

35:01.159 --> 35:03.059
get fed with a tube.

35:05.657 --> 35:07.237
I don't want to tell my mom

35:07.823 --> 35:09.623
what I really think about her,

35:10.381 --> 35:12.141
'cause it will only hurt her.

35:15.825 --> 35:17.519
I don't want to make her feel

35:17.544 --> 35:19.124
how she makes me feel.

35:22.561 --> 35:23.561
Oh, hey.

35:48.554 --> 35:49.794
I am sorry.

35:52.057 --> 35:53.057
I know.

35:55.477 --> 35:56.477
It's okay.

36:41.455 --> 36:43.335
You know, she's bound to overstep again,

36:43.359 --> 36:44.783
not to mention she's entitled.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.030
She's young and
determined to change the world,

36:47.054 --> 36:49.230
the way we all were out of law school.

36:49.255 --> 36:51.765
We could use some wide-eyed
energy around here.

36:51.790 --> 36:54.050
There's a difference between
passion and impertinence.

36:54.075 --> 36:55.975
Jeez, you've got it in for her.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.761
No, I have more cases than I can handle,

36:57.786 --> 36:59.381
and I don't have time to rein in the ego

36:59.405 --> 37:01.872
of a young lawyer who's
got something to prove

37:01.897 --> 37:03.057
because she failed the bar.

37:03.571 --> 37:05.815
Don't worry. She's not your problem.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.040
I'll mentor her.

37:07.975 --> 37:08.975
Like you mentored me?

37:10.201 --> 37:11.501
Let's not go there.

37:24.303 --> 37:25.303
Hey, Evan.

37:25.796 --> 37:26.796
Mariana.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.980
Thanks again for everything.

37:32.372 --> 37:33.372
Of course.

37:41.458 --> 37:44.219
So, I was wondering if you would
like to get a drink with me sometime.

37:47.892 --> 37:50.909
To... talk next steps on the app.

37:54.930 --> 37:56.488
Yeah, sure.

37:56.513 --> 37:57.673
When?

38:00.452 --> 38:01.612
How about now?

38:02.194 --> 38:03.194
Now?

38:03.406 --> 38:04.486
Unless you have plans.

38:05.842 --> 38:08.450
Uh, yeah. Now is great.

38:27.364 --> 38:28.364
Hello?

38:28.891 --> 38:30.591
Hey, hey.

38:30.991 --> 38:31.991
Uh...

38:32.675 --> 38:34.601
I just wanted to let you know, um,

38:34.626 --> 38:36.786
I worked my situation out here. So...

38:37.583 --> 38:38.583
you don't need to worry.

38:41.972 --> 38:43.563
Okay. That's good.

38:43.588 --> 38:44.708
And, um...

38:45.424 --> 38:46.424
look, I'm...

38:47.523 --> 38:49.843
I'm sorry for what I said about...

38:50.622 --> 38:52.382
you coming over and looking me up.

38:53.260 --> 38:55.260
I know it's too late to
be your father, but...

38:56.413 --> 38:57.713
I'd like to be a friend.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.400
This is our dad.

39:04.420 --> 39:07.020
- Hey, man.
- So, this is how you got my back?

39:07.615 --> 39:09.415
- Hey, wait, son.
- Hey, now.

39:10.104 --> 39:11.504
I am not your son.

39:16.235 --> 39:18.455
Yeah, I could always use another friend.

39:21.595 --> 39:23.195
Okay, that's great.
