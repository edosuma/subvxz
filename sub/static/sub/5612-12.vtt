00:02.909 --> 00:04.276
Morning, everyone.

00:04.277 --> 00:05.811
Morning, sir.

00:05.812 --> 00:07.112
Hey, look.

00:07.113 --> 00:09.114
We're food stain buds.

00:09.115 --> 00:10.916
Who are you wearing?
Porridge?

00:10.917 --> 00:12.518
Um,

00:12.519 --> 00:14.653
oatmeal.

00:14.654 --> 00:15.754
Hmm.

00:15.755 --> 00:17.679
Oh, my God.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.824
He didn't even wipe it off.

00:18.825 --> 00:20.359
He's totally given up on life.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.694
It's loneliness.

00:21.695 --> 00:23.896
Ever since Kevin left
for his sabbatical in Paris,

00:23.897 --> 00:25.231
he hasn't been the same.

00:25.232 --> 00:26.765
I tried to get him
out of the house.

00:26.766 --> 00:29.235
I invited him to bar trivia,
but he turned me down,

00:29.236 --> 00:31.337
not that Trivia Newton John
needed the help.

00:31.338 --> 00:32.788
We're nationally ranked.
It's no big deal.

00:32.789 --> 00:34.173
You're right, it's not.

00:34.174 --> 00:35.708
Well, aren't you all
just a bunch

00:35.709 --> 00:37.776
of big-hearted dum-dums.

00:37.777 --> 00:39.879
You want to make him feel
less lonely?

00:39.880 --> 00:41.313
This is how you do it.

00:41.314 --> 00:43.549
- A case file?
- Yeah, dude loves work.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.351
I thought all
your cases were closed.

00:45.352 --> 00:46.886
You were bragging about it
so much last night,

00:46.887 --> 00:48.586
I couldn't hear the end
of the neighbors' fight.

00:48.587 --> 00:49.922
It ended in sex.
It always does.

00:49.923 --> 00:50.990
It didn't make me horny.

00:50.991 --> 00:53.092
It's a cold case
from my first year

00:53.093 --> 00:54.093
as a detective.

00:54.094 --> 00:55.427
Is it active again?

00:55.428 --> 00:56.862
No, but Holt doesn't
have to know that.

00:56.863 --> 00:58.230
So you're gonna lie to him?

00:58.231 --> 01:00.699
No, I'm going to make him
forget about his sadness

01:00.700 --> 01:03.068
through the power of...

01:03.069 --> 01:04.571
distraction!

01:07.440 --> 01:08.607
He's gone.

Ah,<i> hola, mi capitan.</i>

01:31.131 --> 01:33.305
Why am I speaking Italian,
you might ask?

01:33.306 --> 01:34.199
That was Spanish.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.701
Yeah, there are too many
languages.

01:35.702 --> 01:38.070
An old case of mine
is starting to heat up,

01:38.071 --> 01:42.138
and I'd like your old help
to help me solve it, señor?

01:42.358 --> 01:44.109
- Still Spanish.
- Right.

01:44.110 --> 01:46.845
Joey Garibaldi was a mafia
lieutenant.

01:46.846 --> 01:48.681
About eight years ago,
I was closing in on him

01:48.682 --> 01:49.949
when he disappeared.

01:49.950 --> 01:53.024
But now I'm hearing chatter
on the street

01:53.244 --> 01:54.587
that he's back in town.

01:54.588 --> 01:56.789
Will you help me?

01:56.790 --> 01:59.658
Hmm, sounds interesting.
Count me in.

01:59.659 --> 02:01.460
Yes!
Thank you very much, sir.

02:01.461 --> 02:04.063
Uh, good-a bye-a.

02:04.064 --> 02:05.424
Italian.

02:06.866 --> 02:08.434
Ooh, standardized tests?

02:08.435 --> 02:09.833
I have a great trick.

02:10.053 --> 02:11.904
Fill in all the bubbles
with Wite-Out,

02:11.905 --> 02:15.107
jams the machine,
everyone passes.

02:15.108 --> 02:17.476
These are practice
for the lieutenant's exam.

02:17.477 --> 02:18.911
They're kicking my butt.

02:18.912 --> 02:20.427
I can't get better than 70%.

02:20.647 --> 02:22.414
C-minus, the perfect grade...

02:22.415 --> 02:24.450
you pass, but you're still hot.

02:24.451 --> 02:28.687
Captain Holt gave me his test
to help me study.

02:28.688 --> 02:31.023
Look at what the grader
wrote on his essay.

02:31.024 --> 02:32.458
"Thank you for writing this.

02:32.459 --> 02:34.315
Reading it made me
a better man."

02:34.535 --> 02:36.562
I'll never be as good a leader
as Holt.

02:36.563 --> 02:39.398
You need to stop
focusing on tests.

02:39.399 --> 02:42.901
There's more to life than scores
and book learning, okay?

02:42.902 --> 02:45.304
Look at me, I've had no
official dance training.

02:45.305 --> 02:48.741
Yet here I stand...

02:48.742 --> 02:50.176
a miracle of movement.

02:55.215 --> 02:56.815
Hey, you guys seen Boyle?

02:56.816 --> 03:00.119
Yep, he's in a little ball
under his desk.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.987
Oh, no.

03:01.988 --> 03:03.322
Did you watch "Grimm"
again last night?

03:03.323 --> 03:04.657
You know it gives you
nightmares.

03:04.658 --> 03:05.724
I'm sad.

03:05.725 --> 03:07.593
Jason died this morning.

03:07.594 --> 03:08.894
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

03:08.895 --> 03:10.095
Is he a friend of yours?

03:10.096 --> 03:11.263
He was my dog.

03:11.264 --> 03:12.464
Oh, okay, so no big deal then.

03:12.465 --> 03:13.899
No, it is to me.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.568
But don't worry,

03:16.569 --> 03:18.747
I'll find a way
to power through.

03:21.524 --> 03:22.518
Oh, God.

03:22.519 --> 03:24.476
This is how Jason saw the world.

03:24.477 --> 03:26.211
Wait, was this your dog
that humped everything?

03:26.212 --> 03:27.513
Yeah, that's how he died.

03:27.514 --> 03:29.548
He was going to town
on one of my snow boots,

03:29.549 --> 03:31.850
and his little heart
just gave out.

03:31.851 --> 03:33.585
- He didn't even finish.
- Gross.

03:33.586 --> 03:36.789
Anyway, we have to work
a stream of B&E's on 4th Street.

03:36.790 --> 03:37.856
It's time for you to move on.

03:37.857 --> 03:38.924
It's what Jackson
would've wanted.

03:38.925 --> 03:40.658
- Jason!
- Whatever, little buddy.

03:41.936 --> 03:44.596
Captain, thank you
for meeting me.

03:44.597 --> 03:46.165
Sorry to make you work
on a Saturday.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.366
No, nonsense, I was free.

03:47.367 --> 03:48.467
Kevin is still in Paris.

03:48.468 --> 03:49.501
Is he?

03:49.502 --> 03:51.403
Wow, I totally forgot
about that.

03:51.404 --> 03:53.572
Any-hoops, this is all
the stuff that we got

03:53.573 --> 03:55.774
from Garibaldi's apartment
after he disappeared.

03:55.775 --> 03:57.643
Tell me what you see.

03:57.644 --> 04:00.145
This man is in every photograph.

04:00.146 --> 04:01.413
Nick DiTullio.

04:01.414 --> 04:02.915
I actually brought him in
eight years ago,

04:02.916 --> 04:04.083
but he refused to talk.

04:04.084 --> 04:05.651
Of course, you know the saying,

04:05.652 --> 04:08.454
"time shall open up the mouth
of every man

04:08.455 --> 04:09.922
to the truth of his neighbor."

04:09.923 --> 04:11.557
All right, it's a real saying.
Let's not dwell on it.

04:11.558 --> 04:12.991
The point is, he's definitely
gonna tell us

04:12.992 --> 04:14.193
where Garibaldi is.

04:14.194 --> 04:16.295
I don't know where
Garibaldi is, all right?

04:16.296 --> 04:17.529
It's not like we were close.

04:17.529 --> 04:18.930
I was just his trainer
at the gym.

04:18.932 --> 04:20.866
Then why were you always
going out to dinner with him?

04:20.867 --> 04:23.836
- Was he doing reps of linguine?
- Noice.

04:23.837 --> 04:26.038
Look, you don't say no
to Garibaldi, all right?

04:26.039 --> 04:27.740
That's why I always let him
work his chest and his abs

04:27.741 --> 04:28.741
and never his legs.

04:28.742 --> 04:29.842
Yeah, the key is balance.

04:29.843 --> 04:31.610
That's why I never
work any of it.

04:31.611 --> 04:33.268
Unless you guys are gonna
arrest me, I got to go.

04:33.488 --> 04:35.714
There's an emergency at the gym.

04:35.715 --> 04:37.750
Emergency at the gym
just when two cops

04:37.751 --> 04:39.084
show up at his door.

04:39.085 --> 04:40.919
That seems suspicious.
We should follow him.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.455
Yeah, this case might
actually lead somewhere.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.257
Why are you so surprised?

04:45.258 --> 04:49.060
Because every day
on this job is a wonder.

04:51.364 --> 04:52.964
Damn right it is.

05:04.344 --> 05:06.645
Medical examiner, jackpot.

05:06.646 --> 05:08.547
The gym is full of bodies.

05:08.548 --> 05:10.315
- No, Department of Health.
- Oh.

05:10.316 --> 05:12.050
There's been an outbreak
of the mumps.

05:12.051 --> 05:14.686
Mumps, that's a funny word.

05:14.687 --> 05:16.622
It's actually a very serious
and highly contagious

05:16.623 --> 05:17.723
infectious disease.

05:17.724 --> 05:18.791
Yeah, but we're fine.

05:18.792 --> 05:19.958
We were only in contact
with that guy

05:19.959 --> 05:21.293
for a couple of seconds.

05:21.294 --> 05:23.330
Plus, he didn't even
lick any of our eyeballs.

05:23.331 --> 05:24.839
I'm afraid you both
have the mumps.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.072
Mumps,
still a funny word.

05:28.292 --> 05:29.734
Are we gonna die?

05:32.557 --> 05:33.824
So you both have the mumps.

05:33.825 --> 05:35.493
Sorry to say,
it's very contagious.

05:35.494 --> 05:37.123
You may not want to
be here, detective.

05:37.124 --> 05:38.529
Oh, it's cool.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.364
I keep up to date
on all my vaccinations.

05:40.365 --> 05:42.633
I'm immune to stuff
you've never even heard of.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.423
But not immune to braggadocio.

05:45.643 --> 05:47.238
Anyhow, over the next
several hours,

05:47.239 --> 05:48.873
you will more than likely
develop fever,

05:48.874 --> 05:50.247
aching, fatigue.

05:50.248 --> 05:51.308
Doesn't sound too bad.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.143
Also, tart foods will cause
intense jaw pain,

05:53.144 --> 05:54.979
so you may want to avoid
sour candies.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.146
What?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.882
You may get painful
goiter-like swelling

05:57.883 --> 06:01.485
in your neck and often extreme
testicular discomfort.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.753
- Okay, okay.
- Cool, cool.

06:02.754 --> 06:04.221
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

06:04.222 --> 06:05.489
No doubt.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.424
Due the highly contagious
nature of the virus,

06:07.425 --> 06:09.126
you will both be quarantined
to your houses

06:09.127 --> 06:10.292
for the next nine days.

06:10.293 --> 06:12.363
Oh, nine days in isolation.

06:12.364 --> 06:14.663
Sir, I'd be happy
to keep you company.

06:14.664 --> 06:16.534
We can watch the ten-part
Nicholas Nickleby

06:16.535 --> 06:18.135
special on PBS.

06:18.136 --> 06:20.538
Hear there's a lot of long,
quiet stretches.

06:20.539 --> 06:22.139
I do love long, quiet stretches,

06:22.140 --> 06:23.741
but I don't want to be a burden.

06:23.742 --> 06:27.111
Plus, I'm getting used
to being on my own.

06:27.112 --> 06:30.614
Or we could be quarantined
together, you know,

06:30.615 --> 06:32.516
work the case.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.985
Yes, that actually sounds
kind of fun.

06:34.986 --> 06:36.086
Kind of?

06:36.087 --> 06:37.488
It's gonna be
the best week ever.

06:37.489 --> 06:39.123
I'm sorry, did you not
hear me say

06:39.124 --> 06:41.025
extreme testicular discomfort?

06:41.026 --> 06:44.161
Yes, we heard you,
Dr. Bad News Doctor.

06:44.162 --> 06:46.063
Okay, so I talked
to Captain Holt.

06:46.064 --> 06:47.765
He and Jake have the mumps.

06:47.766 --> 06:49.913
I'm in charge
until Holt gets better.

06:49.914 --> 06:51.702
Hello, you wanted to see
if you can make

06:51.703 --> 06:52.703
a great captain.

06:52.704 --> 06:53.957
Now's your chance to shine.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.140
You're the pretty little
understudy.

06:56.141 --> 06:57.741
And the aging lead?

06:57.742 --> 06:59.910
Well, she just fell
down the stairs.

06:59.911 --> 07:03.414
Now all's you got to do
is beat those wings

07:03.415 --> 07:05.316
and fly.

07:05.317 --> 07:06.817
So for the next two weeks,

07:06.818 --> 07:08.752
Captain Holt will be
on medical leave,

07:08.753 --> 07:10.758
which means I am
the acting captain.

07:10.978 --> 07:13.190
And we are your royal subjects.

07:13.191 --> 07:14.525
Do continue.

07:14.526 --> 07:16.627
I want this precinct to get
our normal work done,

07:16.628 --> 07:19.100
but also, we're gonna clean out
the evidence room,

07:19.320 --> 07:20.931
step up community service,

07:20.932 --> 07:25.302
and complete these
22 additional tasks.

07:25.303 --> 07:27.304
Every time we check one
off the list,

07:27.305 --> 07:28.906
you're gonna hear this bell.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.809
It's the sound of victory.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.115
Hmm, you should add
"fix bell" to that list.

07:34.946 --> 07:36.947
- Morning, Captain.
- Peralta.

07:36.948 --> 07:39.750
I'd like to introduce you
to someone.

07:41.519 --> 07:42.920
His name is Simon,

07:42.921 --> 07:44.154
and I hate him.

07:44.155 --> 07:46.090
Hello, Simon.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.359
This is Balthazar.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.894
He's an evil demon
who spits fire in my throat.

07:50.895 --> 07:52.029
Goiters, huh?

07:52.030 --> 07:53.464
Anyway.

07:53.465 --> 07:54.865
I've been looking over
these photographs

07:54.866 --> 07:56.333
of the restaurant,
and I've identified

07:56.334 --> 07:58.002
several other known mob types.

07:59.204 --> 08:00.604
What is it?
Did you see something?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.477
No, I just got very cold
very fast.

08:02.697 --> 08:05.442
And now my entire body
is somehow on fire.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.945
Oh, these mumps are jerks.
Whew.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.681
I also noticed
this van is parked out front

08:10.682 --> 08:12.282
in several other photographs.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.617
I never noticed that.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.285
The restaurant must have been
under surveillance.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.286
I bet it was the feds.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.554
You're right.

08:17.555 --> 08:18.656
I'll reach out to my contact
at the bureau,

08:18.657 --> 08:19.816
see if I can get us some
footage.

08:19.817 --> 08:21.086
Good idea.

08:21.087 --> 08:21.959
Also, I know you're not
supposed to,

08:21.960 --> 08:23.627
but I kind of want to
poke my mump.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.995
- Bad idea.
- I'm going in.

08:24.996 --> 08:27.164
Here we go.

08:27.165 --> 08:28.499
It hurts!

08:28.500 --> 08:31.468
How did I not see that coming?

08:31.469 --> 08:32.840
I feel dizzy.

08:33.705 --> 08:34.738
Hey.

08:34.739 --> 08:35.773
You're off the floor.

08:35.774 --> 08:36.940
Yeah.

08:36.941 --> 08:38.046
Well, it's like my dad
used to say.

08:38.047 --> 08:40.144
"Real men don't cry

08:40.145 --> 08:41.378
for more than three days."

08:41.379 --> 08:43.514
So I decided to get my butt
back to work.

08:43.515 --> 08:44.615
Good.

08:44.616 --> 08:45.783
You go through
all the witness statements yet?

08:45.784 --> 08:47.117
What?
Oh, no.

08:47.118 --> 08:50.054
By "work," I meant on Jason's
in memoriam video.

08:50.055 --> 08:51.655
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.991
Take a look at what
I got so far.

08:53.992 --> 08:59.663
<i>♪ Tell me how am I supposed
to live without you ♪</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:02.870
♪ ♪

09:03.090 --> 09:08.105
<i>♪ Now that I've been
loving you so long ♪</i>

09:08.106 --> 09:10.374
Hey, we've got a lot to do.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.210
Focus up and stop
watching funny dog videos.

09:13.211 --> 09:15.279
Aw.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.047
This might just be
the fever talking,

09:17.048 --> 09:19.349
but this unedited footage
of an Italian restaurant

09:19.350 --> 09:21.985
from eight years ago might be
the best movie I've ever seen.

09:21.986 --> 09:23.520
Also, how weird are forks?

09:23.521 --> 09:26.457
Forks are very weird.
I've always thought so.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.659
Yeah, yeah.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.060
Did we take too much
cold medicine?

09:30.061 --> 09:31.295
Not by a long shot.

09:31.296 --> 09:33.263
Balthazar is a thirsty bitch.

09:33.264 --> 09:35.264
Ah, I'll drink to that.

09:37.802 --> 09:40.904
Wait, look.

09:40.905 --> 09:43.407
Garkabargo!

09:43.408 --> 09:46.143
Sorry, can't... can't talk.

09:46.144 --> 09:50.080
Need more medi-jen.

09:50.081 --> 09:52.149
Garibaldi!

09:52.150 --> 09:54.818
He's eating snakes!

09:54.819 --> 09:57.588
No, it's spaghetti.

09:57.589 --> 09:59.156
It's always spaghetti.

09:59.157 --> 10:01.024
I'm just saying,
if that's spaghetti,

10:01.025 --> 10:03.193
it looks like snakes.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.796
That's right, Nine-Nine.

10:05.797 --> 10:07.765
That's the sound
of the victory bell.

10:07.766 --> 10:10.400
We just crossed our first task
off the list.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.535
Oh, my goodness.

10:11.536 --> 10:13.003
Terry, that is so great.

10:13.004 --> 10:14.071
Which one was it?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.939
- Fix bell.
- All right.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.342
Little less than I had
hoped for, but still a thing.

10:18.343 --> 10:20.144
You gonna hear that sound
nonstop.

10:20.145 --> 10:22.629
<i>Unhand her, you beast!</i>

10:22.630 --> 10:23.647
<i>Give it to me!</i>

10:23.648 --> 10:25.349
What the hell is going on
in here?

10:25.350 --> 10:26.739
Hitchcock's trying
to steal my sandwich.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.218
Well, we both ordered
meatball subs,

10:28.219 --> 10:29.219
but they only delivered one.

10:29.220 --> 10:30.487
It's mine!

10:30.488 --> 10:33.690
Guys, guys, look,
just walk to the sub shop...

10:33.691 --> 10:36.393
it's a block away...
and get a second sandwich.

10:36.394 --> 10:38.595
- Walk?
- Are you insane?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.597
Fine, cut the damn
sandwich in half.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.267
And then what, genius?
We each eat a 6-inch sub?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.768
Two and a half meatballs
a piece?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.670
- Are we children?
- What is this, Russia?

10:46.671 --> 10:48.739
Okay, that's it.
No one eats the sub.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.606
Get back to work!

10:53.878 --> 10:54.888
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

10:54.889 --> 10:56.359
Why'd he just go in the kitchen?

10:56.360 --> 10:57.614
Do we have eyes in the kitchen?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.216
There are eyes everywhere, man.

10:59.217 --> 11:01.752
Ow, ow, achy, achy, ow.

11:01.753 --> 11:04.305
Look, he slipped the chef
a piece of paper.

11:04.306 --> 11:05.789
I bet it's the address
of his hideout.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.324
The chef knows where
the hideout is.

11:07.325 --> 11:09.960
His name is Richie Lignardi.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.062
We talk to him,
we find Garibaldi.

11:12.063 --> 11:14.865
We have to go right now.

11:14.866 --> 11:16.166
Go where?

11:16.167 --> 11:17.467
Ah!
What's on your face?

11:17.468 --> 11:21.471
Oh, right, uh, yes,
my disgusting deformity.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.107
Here, let me just...

11:24.108 --> 11:26.009
Hey, what's up, girl?

11:26.010 --> 11:27.010
Better?

11:27.011 --> 11:28.516
It's not worse.

11:28.736 --> 11:30.814
We're on our way right now
to talk to a lead

11:30.815 --> 11:32.616
that knows where Garibaldi's
hideout is.

11:32.617 --> 11:33.917
You're quarantined.

11:33.918 --> 11:35.886
You can't go outside
spewing mumps

11:35.887 --> 11:37.321
like a couple of mump fountains.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.989
Not like this, we can't!

11:38.990 --> 11:40.390
<i>♪ Everyday I'm hustling ♪</i>

11:40.391 --> 11:42.392
<i>♪ E-everyday I'm hustling ♪</i>

11:42.393 --> 11:43.894
<i>♪ Everyday I'm hustling ♪</i>

11:43.895 --> 11:45.863
<i>♪ E-everyday I'm hustling ♪</i>

11:45.864 --> 11:47.397
<i>♪ Everyday I'm hustling ♪</i>

11:47.398 --> 11:49.266
Stop, you can't leave at all.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.901
Good luck trying to stop us.

11:50.902 --> 11:54.504
You'll never catch us!

11:54.505 --> 11:56.473
Amy is Usain Bolt.

11:56.474 --> 11:58.308
Is this the piece of paper
you're looking for?

11:58.309 --> 11:59.776
You found the address?

11:59.777 --> 12:02.679
No, it's a recipe
for baked ziti.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.082
It was taped to your wall
the entire time.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.850
You're delirious,
and you're sick,

12:06.851 --> 12:08.518
and you definitely didn't
solve the case.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.887
You need to go back inside.

12:09.888 --> 12:11.355
Well, I can't.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.723
My legs stopped working.

12:14.459 --> 12:15.726
Ah, my testicles.

12:15.727 --> 12:17.526
The mumps have reached
my testicles.

12:20.189 --> 12:21.523
All right, just finish

12:21.524 --> 12:22.958
taking off your totally
ineffective biohazard suits

12:22.959 --> 12:24.322
and have a little rest.

12:24.323 --> 12:25.294
Nonsense, Santiago.

12:25.295 --> 12:27.629
We just have to buckle down
and work harder.

12:27.630 --> 12:29.264
We simply hit a bump
in the road.

12:29.265 --> 12:31.833
More like a mump in the road.

12:36.679 --> 12:37.739
Such a good one.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.775
Jake, can I talk to you
in private for a minute?

12:39.776 --> 12:42.177
Sure thing, let me just
snag this,

12:42.178 --> 12:43.845
cover up the ol' swell sack.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.913
All right.

12:44.914 --> 12:46.581
Okay, so here's the deal.

12:46.582 --> 12:48.650
I have a high fever,
and I can't control my body,

12:48.651 --> 12:50.152
but you can do whatever
you want to me.

12:50.153 --> 12:53.922
Oh, but don't touch my mouth,
neck, or testicles.

12:53.923 --> 12:55.603
You've badly misread
the situation.

12:55.823 --> 12:57.125
Oh, thank God.

12:57.126 --> 12:59.227
Jake, you need
to drop this case.

12:59.228 --> 13:00.329
What are you talking about?

13:00.330 --> 13:01.430
The plan is working perfectly.

13:01.431 --> 13:02.731
Holt hasn't been lonely
all week.

13:02.732 --> 13:04.566
Yeah, because he's too busy
almost dying.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.069
- Look at him.
- What?

13:07.070 --> 13:08.937
He's just "Beautiful
Mind"-ing it.

13:08.938 --> 13:10.872
Because he's a genius.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.475
He's writing the word "case"
over and over again.

13:13.476 --> 13:15.777
Oh, now he's spelling it
with a K.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.179
Is that not how you spell it?

13:17.180 --> 13:19.681
Again, I have a mouth, neck,
and testicle-melting fever.

13:19.682 --> 13:20.682
- Jake.
- Hmm?

13:20.683 --> 13:22.117
Enough is enough.

13:22.118 --> 13:23.785
You need to drop this stupid
backburner cold case

13:23.786 --> 13:26.300
before you both die
or I will kill you.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.960
Oh, my God, I thought I was
following her.

13:31.961 --> 13:33.795
Yep, I should probably lie down.

13:33.796 --> 13:36.665
Here we go.

13:36.666 --> 13:37.864
Case!

13:41.838 --> 13:43.171
What are you doing?

13:43.172 --> 13:45.974
Just sealing Jason's collar
in an airtight bag

13:45.975 --> 13:47.542
so it retains his scent.

13:47.543 --> 13:49.490
I don't know how many whiffs
I have left.

13:49.710 --> 13:51.680
Wow.

13:51.681 --> 13:53.415
Look, I know that dog
meant a lot to you,

13:53.416 --> 13:55.621
so I got you this.

13:57.687 --> 13:59.121
It's a dog.

13:59.122 --> 14:00.789
His name's Arlo,
but you can call him Jason Two

14:00.790 --> 14:01.823
or whatever.

14:01.824 --> 14:03.191
Seriously?

14:03.192 --> 14:05.293
I can't just replace Jason
with some other dog.

14:05.294 --> 14:07.329
Why not?
All dogs are basically the same.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.965
Watch this.
Arlo, go hump that toy.

14:09.966 --> 14:11.333
Get away from that.

14:11.334 --> 14:12.968
That's Jason's.

14:12.969 --> 14:15.203
Look, man, I've been patient.

14:15.204 --> 14:16.772
We have a case we need
to work on.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.940
It's time for you to
get over it, move on.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.543
Move on?
Move on.

14:21.544 --> 14:23.478
Jason was part of my family,
Rosa.

14:23.479 --> 14:24.980
I loved him.

14:24.981 --> 14:27.783
His humping was the only thing
that got me through my divorce.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.851
Seeing him so happy
made me believe

14:29.852 --> 14:33.021
that I could be happy
one day too.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.623
You wouldn't understand this
because you have

14:34.624 --> 14:38.493
a motorcycle helmet for a heart,
but I need to feel this sadness.

14:38.494 --> 14:41.896
So the only thing
that I'm moving on from is you.

14:47.036 --> 14:49.175
So I, like, have a dog now?

14:50.771 --> 14:52.607
Hey, what's going on
with those files?

14:52.608 --> 14:54.076
Oh, we're not working on them.

14:54.077 --> 14:55.911
- We're on strike.
- Hunger strike.

14:55.912 --> 14:58.559
- You're eating potato chips.
- Chips don't count.

14:58.779 --> 15:00.916
My doctor said they have
zero nutritional value.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.384
We want meatball subs.

15:02.385 --> 15:04.486
You had no right to take ours.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.821
Screw this.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.944
I'll log those files
and teach the Hazmat class,

15:09.164 --> 15:11.126
and I'll do everyone's work,
because apparently,

15:11.127 --> 15:13.561
I am the only one keeping
this precinct together!

15:22.176 --> 15:25.252
Um, I think you
closed the door too hard.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.643
Hey, I found popsicles.

15:28.644 --> 15:30.979
These should help cool us down.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.750
"Thanks, Jake."

15:35.751 --> 15:37.252
You're welcome, nards.

15:37.253 --> 15:39.688
Peralta, Balthazar has a sister.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.023
Meet Penelope.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.426
Guh-hoo, yeah, mumps on mumps.

15:44.427 --> 15:46.728
Let's not dwell on it.
We should get back to work.

15:46.729 --> 15:49.131
Or we could fall asleep
for five to seven days

15:49.132 --> 15:50.567
and see how we feel.

15:50.568 --> 15:52.067
I will not rest
till justice is served.

15:52.068 --> 15:53.101
There's no time to waste.

15:53.102 --> 15:54.503
This case is urgent.

15:54.504 --> 15:56.304
Oh, boy.

15:56.305 --> 15:57.785
All right, listen.

15:58.005 --> 16:00.275
The case may not be
quite as urgent

16:00.276 --> 16:02.310
as once thought.

16:02.311 --> 16:04.179
Um...

16:04.180 --> 16:06.148
I dug it up out of my desk
so you'd have something

16:06.149 --> 16:08.350
to do on weekends
because you seemed so lonely.

16:08.351 --> 16:09.918
You cited chatter
from the streets

16:09.919 --> 16:11.486
that Garibaldi had resurfaced.

16:11.487 --> 16:12.787
I did. I did. I did.

16:12.788 --> 16:16.804
But said chatter
may have been fudged.

16:17.024 --> 16:19.261
So you lied to me?

16:19.262 --> 16:20.521
Out of pity.
You pity me.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.396
I wouldn't put it that way.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.397
I would.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.132
I am offended.
I am angry.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.734
I am very tired.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.936
So I'm gonna take a nap,
but when I wake up,

16:27.937 --> 16:30.995
oh, you are in for it.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.910
How dare you?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.511
How dare me?

16:36.512 --> 16:38.780
How dare you?

16:38.781 --> 16:40.248
I was just trying to help.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.384
Wow, your help feels an awful
lot like pity,

16:42.385 --> 16:45.687
so do me a favor and don't
ever help me again.

16:45.688 --> 16:47.889
Wow, well, you didn't seem
to mind me helping you

16:47.890 --> 16:50.754
when I got you your job back
at the Nine-Nine.

16:50.974 --> 16:54.296
I didn't ask you to do that.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.559
You said we were
out of peas, you pea hog!

16:58.560 --> 17:00.302
- You're the pea hog!
- You're the pea hog!

17:00.303 --> 17:02.037
- No, you!
- You take that back!

17:02.038 --> 17:05.106
You!

17:05.107 --> 17:06.107
Double poke!

17:16.250 --> 17:18.084
Okay, hope you guys are hungry.

17:18.085 --> 17:19.452
Made baked ziti.

17:19.453 --> 17:21.721
Thought it would be fun
to use Garibaldi's

17:21.722 --> 17:23.690
ultra authentic recipe.

17:23.691 --> 17:25.592
Oh, great, pity food.

17:25.593 --> 17:27.827
Thank you anyway,
but I can cook for myself.

17:27.828 --> 17:30.597
Wow, I would roll my eyes
so hard right now

17:30.598 --> 17:31.998
if it didn't make my brain burn.

17:31.999 --> 17:34.301
Okay, Captain, this ends now.

17:34.302 --> 17:36.036
I know your pride is hurt,
but no one

17:36.037 --> 17:37.739
ever took pity on you.

17:37.740 --> 17:38.872
All we wanted to do was help you

17:38.873 --> 17:40.774
when you were down because
that's what people do

17:40.775 --> 17:42.046
when they care about each other.

17:42.047 --> 17:44.644
They tell each other lies
and invent urgent mysteries

17:44.645 --> 17:45.893
that need to be solved?

17:46.113 --> 17:48.448
Come up with excuses
to spend time together

17:48.449 --> 17:51.818
like trivia nights
or folk art festivals.

17:51.819 --> 17:54.854
Or working old-ass cases
with their mumpy boy, Jake.

17:54.855 --> 17:56.709
Back to you, Amy.
We're doing great.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.825
You're gonna eat this ziti,
and you're gonna appreciate it,

17:58.826 --> 18:02.095
and you're gonna
grow the hell up.

18:02.096 --> 18:05.665
Okay, you're right.

18:05.666 --> 18:08.435
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

18:08.436 --> 18:09.969
I can't wait to eat your food.

18:13.341 --> 18:15.709
Ugh, this is revolting.

18:15.710 --> 18:19.112
Wow, have you learned nothing?

18:19.113 --> 18:20.547
Oh, God!

18:20.548 --> 18:22.716
That is worse
than the mumps, Amy.

18:22.717 --> 18:23.817
What the hell?

18:23.818 --> 18:26.152
I used Garibaldi's exact recipe.

18:26.153 --> 18:27.253
I know I'm not a great cook,

18:27.254 --> 18:28.888
but I love following
instructions.

18:28.889 --> 18:30.590
Seven cups of salt?

18:30.591 --> 18:31.958
Even I know this isn't a recipe.

18:31.959 --> 18:33.486
Which means it might be a code.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.192
Ooh, interesting.

18:35.412 --> 18:37.897
Ten digits, maybe it's
a phone number.

18:37.898 --> 18:39.863
Look, 718, Brooklyn area code.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.002
Yes, that's definitely it.

18:42.003 --> 18:44.437
Wait, did you actually use
all of this salt

18:44.438 --> 18:46.539
and 18 cups of oregano?

18:46.540 --> 18:47.879
Back off, I solved the case.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.342
Nine onions?

18:49.343 --> 18:50.541
Oh, Amy.

18:50.761 --> 18:52.478
How am I the bad guy here?

18:54.890 --> 18:57.584
All right, all right,
looks good.

18:57.585 --> 18:59.653
I can barely tell you
hulked out in here.

18:59.654 --> 19:01.588
Yeah, but two weeks in charge,

19:01.589 --> 19:03.857
and I didn't get any
of my goals accomplished.

19:03.858 --> 19:06.337
You got Hitchcock and Scully
off their hunger strike.

19:06.338 --> 19:07.961
I just threw a bunch
of popcorn on the floor.

19:07.962 --> 19:09.262
It wasn't that hard.

19:09.263 --> 19:11.164
Yeah, they're animals.

19:11.165 --> 19:14.100
Do you want to know why
the amazing Captain Holt

19:14.101 --> 19:16.069
has never gotten the evidence
room cleaned

19:16.070 --> 19:17.370
or done anything on your list?

19:17.371 --> 19:18.705
Why?

19:18.706 --> 19:20.774
Because all day long,
he's putting out fires.

19:20.775 --> 19:22.509
That's what a captain does.

19:22.510 --> 19:24.477
The only difference between
you and Holt

19:24.478 --> 19:27.313
is that he lacks the strength
to close a door so hard

19:27.314 --> 19:28.515
a room blows up.

19:28.516 --> 19:29.983
Thanks, Gina.

19:29.984 --> 19:31.918
Ah, you don't have to thank me.

19:31.919 --> 19:34.959
All I did was be the only person
who believes in you.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.589
Don't lean against the door.

19:36.590 --> 19:39.159
Terry caused structural damage.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.793
My God, you're strong.

19:43.898 --> 19:45.464
Briefing room, now.

19:46.785 --> 19:50.770
I really don't feel like
having you yell at me anymore.

19:50.771 --> 19:51.581
What is this?

19:51.582 --> 19:53.907
It's a funeral for Jason.

19:53.908 --> 19:55.307
I want to say a few words.

20:00.548 --> 20:02.863
When Jason died seven days ago,
I didn't give a rat's ass.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.284
This is your speech?

20:04.285 --> 20:05.885
'Cause I didn't understand
why people care so much

20:05.886 --> 20:08.721
about their dumb dogs
till I got a dumb dog myself.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.493
I've only had Arlo
for a day and a half,

20:13.494 --> 20:15.695
but if anything happened to him,
I would kill everyone

20:15.696 --> 20:17.063
in this room and then myself.

20:17.064 --> 20:19.566
Very violent eulogy, I like it.

20:19.567 --> 20:20.967
Charles, I'm sorry.

20:20.968 --> 20:22.335
You don't have to get over it.

20:22.336 --> 20:24.304
Take as long as you want.

20:24.305 --> 20:26.039
Scully, it's time.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.942
<i>♪ Ave Maria ♪</i>

20:31.528 --> 20:33.273
Okay, thank you.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.848
Good news, Garibaldi's
phone number's still active,

20:34.849 --> 20:36.188
so they were able to locate him.

20:36.408 --> 20:38.485
SWAT just picked him up,
so that's that.

20:38.486 --> 20:39.886
Yeah, that's that.

20:39.887 --> 20:42.722
Perfect timing
as our quarantine has finally ended

20:42.723 --> 20:43.957
and our goiters are gone.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.258
Yes, indeed.

20:45.259 --> 20:46.760
We're free to go outside
and lick whoever's

20:46.761 --> 20:48.127
eyeballs we'd like.

20:48.128 --> 20:49.662
Inaccurate, no one is ever
free to do that.

20:49.663 --> 20:50.450
Yeah, you're right.

20:50.451 --> 20:53.032
Anyhow, I am out.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.266
Wait a minute.

20:56.937 --> 20:59.139
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

20:59.140 --> 21:02.275
I was too proud to admit
I was lonely.

21:02.276 --> 21:04.591
So thank you.

21:04.811 --> 21:06.212
You're welcome.

21:06.213 --> 21:07.547
Ain't no thang.

21:07.548 --> 21:09.649
No, it is a thang,
and an even bigger thang

21:09.650 --> 21:11.417
is that you brought me
back to the Nine-Nine,

21:11.418 --> 21:13.886
and I will always
be grateful for that.

21:13.887 --> 21:15.982
So...
Here.

21:18.033 --> 21:20.017
This is for you.

21:20.018 --> 21:21.906
Oh, sour candies.

21:21.907 --> 21:23.789
I missed you so much!

21:24.905 --> 21:26.492
Oh!
It burns!

21:27.395 --> 21:29.590
Thank you for this candies!
