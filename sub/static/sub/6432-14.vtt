[Laughter]

08:40.488 --> 08:43.157
Hey. What's that?

08:46.728 --> 08:49.463
[All scream]

08:51.000 --> 08:57.074

09:00.858 --> 09:03.059
Okay,
so, 48 years old,

09:03.093 --> 09:05.228
single,
a compulsive gambler

09:05.262 --> 09:07.564
who just hit it big
at the blackjack table.

09:07.598 --> 09:10.667
And probably not last seen
floating around a strip club.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.635
Her fingertips
had frostbite,

09:12.670 --> 09:13.937
her lips were blue,

09:13.971 --> 09:15.538
and witnesses saw her
glowing orange.

09:15.573 --> 09:16.739
Just like Luke.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.741
But how does a teacher
from the midwest

09:18.776 --> 09:21.377
cross paths
with our bachelor crew?

09:21.412 --> 09:25.281
Maybe at the Maximus Hotel
And Casino?

09:25.316 --> 09:29.018
Now, I'm gonna take the--
what is this?

09:29.053 --> 09:30.486
This is a complete--aah.

09:30.521 --> 09:31.621
Hello, Arthur.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.390
- This is Abigail Chow.
- Hi.

09:34.425 --> 09:36.025
Yeah. I'm just
reorganizing here.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.393
What, are we having
an open house?

09:37.428 --> 09:40.096
Ms. Chow is the new owner
of the Bed & Breakfast.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.832
New owner?

09:42.866 --> 09:45.101
How did--was--was she--?

09:45.135 --> 09:46.736
She has been briefed
by the Regents,

09:46.770 --> 09:48.838
and there has been
a request made

09:48.872 --> 09:50.607
that you show her around.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.942
Around?

09:52.977 --> 09:54.277
Around the Warehouse?

09:54.311 --> 09:56.346
Well, just enough
to get her feet wet.

09:56.380 --> 09:58.281
No need to frighten her off.

09:58.315 --> 10:00.249
I don't frighten easily.

10:00.284 --> 10:02.418
- Arthur, is it?
- Artie.

10:02.453 --> 10:03.519
So nice to meet you.

10:03.554 --> 10:06.289
Mrs. Frederic has told me
so much about--

10:06.323 --> 10:07.657
Yeah.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.092
You'll grow to hate that.

10:13.097 --> 10:14.864
So, she was
a big blackjack player?

10:14.898 --> 10:16.666
Yes, yes,
the schoolteacher.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.401
She was only supposed
to stay here for two nights,

10:18.435 --> 10:19.569
but I kept her here
for five.

10:19.603 --> 10:20.937
What do you mean
you "kept her"?

10:20.971 --> 10:22.739
Well, that's what I do.

10:22.773 --> 10:24.507
I keep high rollers
in the hotel.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.209
The longer they stay,
the more they spend.

10:26.243 --> 10:27.477
And how do you do that?

10:27.511 --> 10:31.814
Room upgrades, lounge passes,
Val Preston tickets,

10:31.849 --> 10:33.816
- meal vouchers--
- Val who tickets?

10:33.851 --> 10:38.054
Val Preston,
the hottest act on the strip.

10:38.088 --> 10:39.389
So, Val Preston's a magician.

10:39.423 --> 10:40.556
You're kidding.

10:40.591 --> 10:43.059
The top magician in Vegas.

10:43.093 --> 10:46.295
Devil's Chamber, Sands Of
The Nile, Asrah levitation.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.331
Levitation.

10:48.365 --> 10:51.100
Is there any chance
you also gave tickets

10:51.135 --> 10:53.670
to those boys from
the stag party last night?

10:53.704 --> 10:56.506
- Of course.
- Is Preston on tonight?

10:56.540 --> 10:59.909
I imagine he just turned
a volunteer

10:59.943 --> 11:01.377
into a flock of doves.

11:01.412 --> 11:04.013
- A paranormal precedent...
- Right this way.

11:04.048 --> 11:05.148
Step right up there.
Best seats in the house.

11:05.182 --> 11:07.750
Best seats in the house.
Enjoy.

11:07.785 --> 11:10.086
And slide it underneath.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.021
And upon my command,

11:12.056 --> 11:16.225
you will be able to lift her
into the air.

11:16.260 --> 11:19.228
Rise!

11:19.263 --> 11:20.997
[Cheers and applause]

11:21.031 --> 11:25.201
Houston, we have liftoff.

11:25.235 --> 11:30.273
[Cheers and applause]

11:31.275 --> 11:34.410
[Playing <i>Call To The Post]</i>

11:34.445 --> 11:36.612
Sensibility
breaks through,

11:36.647 --> 11:38.781
followed by horizon
on the outside.

11:38.816 --> 11:41.184
- Morning dew is third...
- Come on!

11:41.218 --> 11:43.319
Followed by sunrise.

11:43.353 --> 11:46.923
So, Sir Henry Baker
from Swindon owns Trudie Stein

11:46.957 --> 11:48.858
and still owns
horse number two.

11:48.892 --> 11:50.560
He also owns this shmancy club

11:50.594 --> 11:52.061
and is the biggest
racehorse broker in London.

11:52.096 --> 11:53.563
You didn't even have
to call Artie.

11:53.597 --> 11:55.264
Reminding me,
what do you know

11:55.299 --> 11:56.699
about this whole
Regent issue?

11:56.734 --> 11:58.334
Oh, God, dog with a bone.
Nothing.

11:58.368 --> 11:59.602
When has it ever
worked out well for you

11:59.636 --> 12:01.971
to keep a secret from me?
[Exhales]

12:03.207 --> 12:06.175
I'm not gonna like this,
am I?

12:06.210 --> 12:08.111
I was approached
by Adwin Kosan to keep

12:08.145 --> 12:10.747
- an eye on Artie, and--
- What?

12:10.781 --> 12:11.914
What, they don't
trust him after--

12:11.949 --> 12:13.549
And I told them the truth,

12:13.584 --> 12:15.852
that he'd been
acting erratic.

12:15.886 --> 12:16.919
You ratted on him?

12:16.954 --> 12:18.321
- I'm worried about him.
- Well, so am I.

12:18.355 --> 12:20.590
I didn't go squealing
to Warehouse brass about it.

12:20.624 --> 12:22.558
Look, one thing
I learned at the ATF,

12:22.593 --> 12:23.626
if an agent
is not in control,

12:23.660 --> 12:25.261
he doesn't belong
in the field.

12:25.295 --> 12:26.929
Artie is in control,
he just--

12:26.964 --> 12:28.297
Jumped in front
of a moving car

12:28.332 --> 12:29.298
with you in the trunk.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.767
You both
could've been killed.

12:30.801 --> 12:34.003
Claude, I won't apologize
for doing what is right

12:34.037 --> 12:36.105
and what I was asked
to do by my boss.

12:38.408 --> 12:40.309
We are so not done
talking about this.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.612
And where do you think
you're going?

12:42.646 --> 12:44.013
- The Stallion Club.
- No, no.

12:44.047 --> 12:45.281
Not dressed like that
you're not.

12:45.315 --> 12:47.817
I would suggest you contact
your fairy godmother

12:47.851 --> 12:49.252
and have her turn you
into a princess.

12:49.286 --> 12:52.021
The closest thing I have
to a fairy godmother,

12:52.055 --> 12:54.590
besides you,
is my boss's credit card.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.392
[British accent]
Beg pardon, Sir Henry Baker?

12:56.426 --> 12:57.994
That's right, love.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.462
We're with
the Royal Racing Commission.

12:59.496 --> 13:01.130
- We just have a few qu--
- Rubbish.

13:01.165 --> 13:02.632
I know everyone
on the commission,

13:02.666 --> 13:03.966
and none of them
would be seen dead

13:04.001 --> 13:05.268
wearing that hat.

13:05.302 --> 13:07.737
[Laughter]

13:07.771 --> 13:08.738
[Drops accent]
Okay.

13:08.772 --> 13:10.173
We're government agents

13:10.207 --> 13:11.774
investigating your involvement
with the two horses

13:11.809 --> 13:13.676
whose jockeys fell
into a coma this week.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.344
Attempted murder-type thing.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.913
[All murmuring]

13:16.947 --> 13:18.648
[Woman clears throat]

13:18.682 --> 13:20.049
Now I'm gonna need to see
the records for every horse

13:20.083 --> 13:21.350
you've bought or sold
in the last year.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.286
I keep extensive records

13:23.320 --> 13:25.021
on all the horses
at this track,

13:25.055 --> 13:28.357
but pushy Americans waving
badges are not going to--

13:28.392 --> 13:30.326
[Audience ohs]

13:30.360 --> 13:33.529
The jockey riding
Silver Princess

13:33.564 --> 13:35.198
seems to have fallen
from the horse.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.199
He seems to be unconscious.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.633
It's happening again.

13:37.668 --> 13:40.236
Emergency personnel
are rushing to the track.

13:40.270 --> 13:43.005
Well, there you have it.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.574
Silver Princess--

13:44.608 --> 13:48.511
I've neither owned nor bid on
that horse in my life.

13:48.545 --> 13:52.114
[Laughs]
Sir Henry, ah.

13:52.149 --> 13:54.183
I'm terribly ashamed.

13:54.218 --> 13:55.585
Could you possibly
forgive me?

13:55.619 --> 13:57.320
You're obviously beyond
reproach.

13:57.354 --> 13:58.788
Of course I am.

13:58.822 --> 14:02.358
If you'd let me take
just a peek at your research,

14:02.392 --> 14:05.228
I'd be happy to return it
to you at my hotel.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.997
Room 416
at the Cathcart Towers.

14:08.031 --> 14:10.967
Well, I don't think
I'll miss it

14:11.001 --> 14:12.001
for a few hours.

14:12.035 --> 14:15.271
Shall we say 10:00 tonight?

14:15.305 --> 14:17.273
Make it 9:45.

14:17.307 --> 14:19.375
Hmm.

14:19.409 --> 14:21.377
[Exhales]
I wouldn't want to be

14:21.411 --> 14:23.813
whoever's in room 416
at the Cathcart Towers Hotel.

14:23.847 --> 14:25.581
Neither would I.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.117
Thanks, Jeeves.
[Pats bottom]

14:30.220 --> 14:32.788
So Mrs. Frederic tells me
that you've been working here

14:32.823 --> 14:33.956
for quite a while now.

14:33.991 --> 14:35.758
- How long has it been?
- Around 400 years.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.860
Really?
Well, you look good.

14:37.895 --> 14:39.562
You must have built up
quite a pension by now.

14:39.596 --> 14:41.097
Yeah,
artifacts are shelved

14:41.131 --> 14:42.698
according to
specific properties

14:42.733 --> 14:44.300
that they've got.

14:44.334 --> 14:45.801
Is this Julia Child's apron?

14:45.836 --> 14:47.270
It's not to be touched!

14:47.304 --> 14:49.572
They're never to be touched
without proper protection.

14:49.606 --> 14:51.040
It's not a curio shop,
Ms. Chow.

14:51.074 --> 14:52.675
- The original Ginsu knife?
- Yeah.

14:52.709 --> 14:55.244
Is that an artifact because it
can cut through aluminum cans?

14:55.279 --> 14:56.345
These are very dangerous--

14:56.380 --> 14:57.880
What did the Regents
tell you exactly?

14:57.915 --> 14:59.982
Are we allowed to check things
out, like a library?

15:00.017 --> 15:01.450
No, don't!
No, no.

15:01.485 --> 15:04.320
Ah, God.
I'm sorry.

15:04.354 --> 15:05.788
Look, it's just
that this place--

15:05.822 --> 15:08.090
People can get hurt!
Okay?

15:08.125 --> 15:10.126
And it takes a while
for people to really grasp

15:10.160 --> 15:12.128
just how dangerous
these things can be,

15:12.162 --> 15:15.731
- so I'm sorry.
- I apologize.

15:15.766 --> 15:17.099
It must be a terrible burden

15:17.134 --> 15:19.835
to be responsible
for all of these things.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.003
Well, it can be.
Yes.

15:21.038 --> 15:23.572
So, how do you
deal with it?

15:23.607 --> 15:25.474
Apparently, by slapping
perfect strangers.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.243
[Chuckles]

15:27.277 --> 15:29.078
It's been a very tough year.

15:29.112 --> 15:31.113
Oh, we all have them.

15:31.148 --> 15:34.550
Well, in my case,
it's all my fault, so--

15:34.584 --> 15:35.551
Look, if you ever want--

15:35.585 --> 15:36.986
- Never mind.
- What?

15:37.020 --> 15:40.623
It's just if you ever want
to talk about it.

15:40.657 --> 15:42.658
Oh, well,
it's a rather long story

15:42.693 --> 15:44.327
with a very bad ending.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.828
Well, I like long stories.

15:45.862 --> 15:50.032
I don't know.

15:51.902 --> 15:55.371
What exactly did you do
before you bought the B&B?

15:55.405 --> 15:57.606
A lot of things.
Why do you ask?

15:57.641 --> 16:01.777
Oh, anything in the field
of psychotherapy?

16:01.812 --> 16:03.946
Yes.

16:03.981 --> 16:05.881
You have got
to be kidding me!

16:05.916 --> 16:08.351
And Mrs. Frederic tells me
that you are an innkeeper.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.420
What a great joke that is!
Do you know how humiliating it--

16:11.455 --> 16:12.722
- The Regents just simply felt--
- Oh, the Regents!

16:12.756 --> 16:13.956
The Regents
are a part of this!

16:13.991 --> 16:15.758
Brilliant! Of course
they're a part of this.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.727
Otherwise, they wouldn't come up
with such a stupid plan.

16:17.761 --> 16:18.995
You all have nothing better
to do than sit around

16:19.029 --> 16:20.496
and discuss
my mental health?

16:20.530 --> 16:21.764
You know what you can do?

16:21.798 --> 16:23.566
You can run back to them
and tell them you failed.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.633
Maybe they can come up
with somebody to help you

16:24.668 --> 16:27.503
work through
your disappointment.

16:27.537 --> 16:30.573
See if you can psychoanalyze
your way out of the stacks.

16:33.543 --> 16:35.745
[Cheers and applause]

16:35.779 --> 16:36.879
Whoo!

16:36.913 --> 16:39.115
Great show! Great show!
Terrific.

16:39.149 --> 16:40.716
Why are there
48 empty seats out there

16:40.751 --> 16:42.518
when the hotel
is passing out free tickets

16:42.552 --> 16:43.519
like they're Halloween candy?

16:43.553 --> 16:44.787
Val, listen,
listen, listen.

16:44.821 --> 16:46.155
What good is a promoter

16:46.189 --> 16:48.457
- who can't get me a full house?
- Val, Val, listen.

16:48.492 --> 16:49.825
The president--well, maybe not
the president, but--

16:49.860 --> 16:51.527
Shut up while
I'm firing you!

16:51.561 --> 16:54.663
I'm thinking Mr. Presto
might not be so cooperative.

16:54.698 --> 16:56.198
Pete, look at this.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.667
So the levitation trick was
just a harness.

16:58.702 --> 17:00.669
The desert around Las Vegas
is littered

17:00.704 --> 17:01.971
with the bodies
of nosey people.

17:02.005 --> 17:04.507
Oh, yeah?
We're not nosey.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.840
We're Secret Service.

17:05.876 --> 17:07.943
Secret Service?

17:07.978 --> 17:09.278
I know why you're here.

17:09.311 --> 17:11.380
Do you want to see
something truly magical?

17:11.415 --> 17:14.016
Truly, truly magical.
Come on.

17:14.050 --> 17:16.018
[Claps]
Follow me.

17:16.053 --> 17:17.386
Here's the trick.

17:17.421 --> 17:19.387
I'm making you disappear.

17:19.423 --> 17:20.656
And you can shove that badge

17:20.690 --> 17:22.124
where your search warrant
ought to be.

17:22.159 --> 17:23.358
Mr. Preston,
we just have some questions

17:23.393 --> 17:24.359
- about your levitation--
- No, no, no!

17:24.394 --> 17:25.828
You want to know my secrets?

17:25.862 --> 17:28.030
Get an executive order.
Now get--whoa!

17:28.065 --> 17:29.799
- Whoa! Oh, God!
- Oh!

17:29.833 --> 17:33.536
Oh, my God!
[Screams]

17:33.570 --> 17:35.805
Aah!

17:45.039 --> 17:47.492
Metro police
is starting a search.

17:47.518 --> 17:49.344
I told them a jet pack
he was using

17:49.378 --> 17:50.879
for a new trick
malfunctioned.

17:50.953 --> 17:53.555
I don't think
that the artifact's here.

17:53.589 --> 17:55.123
Hey, hey.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.125
Why was Val so ticked off?

17:57.159 --> 17:58.393
I've been telling him,

17:58.427 --> 18:01.396
you play the same venue
for a decade, attendance drops.

18:01.430 --> 18:03.098
He needs new material.

18:03.132 --> 18:04.866
They said he was
the hottest act on the strip.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.102
[Sighs]
Val's a great performer.

18:07.136 --> 18:10.171
He's a showman,
but as for the magic,

18:10.206 --> 18:12.007
I guess there's no magicians
left to steal from.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.776
Wait, so Val Preston
steals his tricks?

18:14.810 --> 18:17.012
I found him
in the Luxy Lounge

18:17.046 --> 18:18.747
right here at the Maximus.

18:18.781 --> 18:20.515
He was taping
Monty The Magnificent

18:20.549 --> 18:22.150
- on his cell phone.
- Okay, wait.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.786
I saw the poster of Monty
in the lobby.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.688
That guy's, like, 110.
[Phone beeps]

18:26.722 --> 18:27.956
And that's an old picture.

18:27.990 --> 18:29.457
But Val's panicked.

18:29.492 --> 18:31.926
He's got a big outdoor
promotional stunt planned,

18:31.961 --> 18:33.495
but he's got nothing new.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.165
The word is, Monty
actually has something new.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.235
Pete, word is right.
Check this out.

18:40.269 --> 18:42.604
And remember that Val
was the one filming it.

18:42.638 --> 18:44.906
Monty The Magnificent
has developed

18:44.940 --> 18:48.143
the ability
to levitate anyone.

18:48.177 --> 18:49.310
Uh-huh.

18:49.345 --> 18:54.115
So, do I have any volunteers?

18:54.150 --> 18:56.351
Come on.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.586
Ooh.

18:58.621 --> 19:00.321
You, sir.
With the camera.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.390
That's all right.
That's all right.

19:02.425 --> 19:03.858
Me on. Film away.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.027
Real magic
has nothing to hide.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.364
So Monty uses an artifact
to levitate a volunteer,

19:09.398 --> 19:10.965
and then sometime later,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.634
the volunteer shoots up
into the sky.

19:12.668 --> 19:15.970
We have to get to Monty
before his next show.

19:21.944 --> 19:23.478
[Sighs]

19:26.982 --> 19:29.517
Abigail.

19:29.552 --> 19:30.852
That is annoying.

19:30.886 --> 19:32.053
It's rather unorthodox

19:32.088 --> 19:34.222
to administer counsel
without the patient.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.224
You throw a man
like Artie Nielson at me

19:36.258 --> 19:37.592
without so much as a warning?

19:37.626 --> 19:39.094
What would you
have had me say?

19:39.128 --> 19:41.729
That he's exactly the kind
of arrogant, closed off,

19:41.764 --> 19:43.698
know-it-all that drove me away
from this work.

19:43.732 --> 19:46.601
And I would argue that Arthur
is exactly the kind of man

19:46.635 --> 19:49.037
- that should make you stay.
- Now who's analyzing?

19:49.071 --> 19:50.138
Look, if you really
want to help,

19:50.172 --> 19:51.673
you'll tell me
which of these artifacts

19:51.707 --> 19:52.874
will help Artie
numb his pain.

19:52.908 --> 19:55.276
Dr. Chow,
we do not use artifacts

19:55.311 --> 19:56.945
to solve our problems.

19:56.979 --> 19:58.279
We prevent the use of them.

19:58.314 --> 19:59.547
Yes, I know.

19:59.582 --> 20:01.716
But if you want me
to play in your sandbox,

20:01.750 --> 20:05.420
I need to have access
to your toys.

20:06.655 --> 20:08.056
[Car door closes]

20:09.458 --> 20:12.193
Hello. Monty Dilman?

20:12.228 --> 20:13.495
No, I'm his cardiologist.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.396
- Oh.
- Is he all right?

20:15.431 --> 20:17.799
He needs to stop performing.
Are you family?

20:17.833 --> 20:20.034
No, we're...

20:20.069 --> 20:21.102
- Fans.
- Fans.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.137
Great.

20:22.171 --> 20:23.505
Well, try not
to get him excited.

20:23.539 --> 20:26.808
He's fragile.

20:26.842 --> 20:30.645
Yes, yes.
Come in.

20:30.679 --> 20:32.280
So, what hotel
are you kids from?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.616
We're actually
with the Secret Service.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.751
We're just here to ask you
a few questions.

20:36.785 --> 20:39.921
Did you recently levitate
a Val Preston?

20:39.955 --> 20:41.856
[Chuckles]

20:41.891 --> 20:45.360
Whoo, hoo, hoo.
I knew it.

20:45.394 --> 20:49.030
After all these years,
I finally found it.

20:49.064 --> 20:50.498
I'd only been doing it
a few days,

20:50.533 --> 20:53.668
and that bozo Preston
came trying to steal it.

20:53.702 --> 20:55.803
Oh, I saw him skulking
around the audience

20:55.838 --> 20:57.038
with his little camera.

20:57.072 --> 20:59.274
He was hoping to use my trick

20:59.308 --> 21:02.177
in his big bamboozala festival
tonight.

21:02.211 --> 21:03.411
Well, it doesn't look like

21:03.445 --> 21:06.214
he'll be bamboozaling tonight
after all.

21:06.248 --> 21:08.416
Monty,
if you knew Mr. Preston

21:08.450 --> 21:09.784
was trying
to steal your trick,

21:09.818 --> 21:11.619
then why use him
as a volunteer?

21:11.654 --> 21:14.022
Because he'll go nuts
trying to figure it out.

21:14.056 --> 21:15.490
And you know why?

21:15.524 --> 21:18.660
It's not a trick.

21:18.694 --> 21:22.363
It's real magic.

21:22.398 --> 21:26.534
Well, look, that's
kind of why we're here, Monty.

21:26.569 --> 21:29.270
We need you to hand over
whatever it is

21:29.305 --> 21:31.206
you're using to levitate
these people.

21:31.240 --> 21:35.843
You don't hand over magic.
You earn it.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.346
Look, I was almost dead
in this town.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.083
Maximus gave me a month
to clear my stuff out.

21:42.117 --> 21:43.518
But not now.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.354
Because you found
this thing.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.690
Vegas has always known
a "wow" factor

21:48.724 --> 21:51.526
when it saw one, and boy,
have I got a "wow" factor.

21:51.560 --> 21:56.164
[Clanging]

22:01.604 --> 22:03.771
[Clears throat]
Look, Monty.

22:03.806 --> 22:06.941
We're not trying to mess
with your "wow," okay?

22:06.976 --> 22:10.044
But whatever gadget or gizmo
you're using

22:10.079 --> 22:11.079
to perform this trick,

22:11.113 --> 22:14.115
it--it might be dangerous.

22:14.149 --> 22:16.951
You're such a noodge.

22:16.986 --> 22:18.786
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, gorgeous?

22:18.821 --> 22:22.724
Come over here.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.026
[Paper rustling]
This is a trick.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.294
[Laughs]

22:26.328 --> 22:28.363
What I'm doing
is real magic.

22:28.397 --> 22:33.868
So, you're levitating people
with just your mind.

22:33.902 --> 22:39.374
And... energy
from the audience.

22:39.408 --> 22:44.479
It's what I've--
it's what I've lived for.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.884
This is the moment.

22:51.053 --> 22:53.121
Look, you see,
the thing is, Monty,

22:53.155 --> 22:55.957
there might be some
unfortunate side effects

22:55.991 --> 22:57.625
on the people
you're levitating.

22:57.660 --> 23:00.995
Is there any way that
you could maybe show us

23:01.030 --> 23:03.197
how the--
how the trick works?

23:03.232 --> 23:05.033
Well, that would be
my great pleasure.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.267
I'd be delighted.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.802
But I need an audience,
you know.

23:07.836 --> 23:09.037
I need the energy.

23:09.071 --> 23:12.006
Come to the matinee
as my guests.

23:12.041 --> 23:14.876
I'll waive
the two-drink minimum,

23:14.910 --> 23:15.977
but not the cover.

23:16.011 --> 23:17.912
Right.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.450
Silver Princess
was already stripped bare

23:22.484 --> 23:23.451
but the time I got to her.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.119
Checked her equipment.
Nothing.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.587
Yeah, nothing
in Sir Henry's research either.

23:26.622 --> 23:27.755
Horses had different breeders,

23:27.790 --> 23:28.823
different trainers,
different everything.

23:28.857 --> 23:30.491
Well, what about
race day routines?

23:30.526 --> 23:32.260
Nothing that--

23:32.294 --> 23:35.096
Wait, all three horses
saw the track vet

23:35.130 --> 23:36.764
with an injury
the day before they raced.

23:36.799 --> 23:38.099
So why'd
the jockeys get hit?

23:38.133 --> 23:39.934
Something the vet used on them?
Stitches, bandages,

23:39.968 --> 23:41.336
something the jockeys
touched?

23:41.370 --> 23:43.538
And then it somehow drains
the adrenaline from the jockey--

23:43.572 --> 23:44.806
And pumps it into the horse
to make it win.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.107
A boost of adrenaline.

23:46.141 --> 23:48.676
Let's go have a wee chat
with Dr. Doolittle.

23:48.711 --> 23:49.711
[Horse neighs]

23:50.979 --> 23:52.046
What?

23:52.081 --> 23:53.147
I'm not laughing at you,

23:53.182 --> 23:54.482
I'm laughing with the horse.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.684
[Imitates whinnying]

23:56.719 --> 23:57.819
[Horse whinnies]
[Laughs] See?

23:57.853 --> 24:00.021
Mm-hmm.

24:01.390 --> 24:05.660
I think... you have it.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.164
The Jack of diamonds, right?

24:10.199 --> 24:13.501
[Applause]

24:15.671 --> 24:18.005
What are you,
some kind of a kleptomaniac?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.340
Come on.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.209
Let's hear it for this guy!

24:21.243 --> 24:23.277
Get off the stage, you bum.

24:23.312 --> 24:24.812
So, when he gets
to the levitation bit,

24:24.847 --> 24:26.114
we pull the plug?

24:26.148 --> 24:28.015
No, we gotta get eyes
on the artifact first,

24:28.050 --> 24:30.218
and then stop him
before he can use it.

24:30.252 --> 24:32.553
My next trick
is quickly becoming the envy

24:32.588 --> 24:34.155
of every magician
in Las Vegas,

24:34.189 --> 24:35.623
I daresay, the world.

24:35.657 --> 24:39.560
I have been performing
this amazing feat on volunteers.

24:39.595 --> 24:45.533
However, questions have arisen
as to its very safety.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.935
And so, tonight in order
to prove that

24:47.970 --> 24:49.604
it is in no way harmful,

24:49.638 --> 24:53.174
I shall endeavor
to levitate myself.

24:53.208 --> 24:54.375
No!

24:54.410 --> 24:56.310
I mean--
[Laughs]

24:56.345 --> 24:57.445
Monty, I don't think
that's a very--

24:57.479 --> 25:00.114
Rose, my lovely Rose.

25:00.149 --> 25:03.751
The government has sent us
two of its finest agents

25:03.786 --> 25:07.922
to investigate my magic,
and I must prove to them

25:07.956 --> 25:09.424
that it is safe.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.092
I would ask you now

25:11.126 --> 25:13.728
to please put your hands
over your heats,

25:13.762 --> 25:16.264
and when I say,
"Rise up,"

25:16.298 --> 25:20.902
you will lift me off the stage
with the combined power

25:20.936 --> 25:25.540
of your minds and my magic.

25:25.574 --> 25:28.209
Uh....
Sorry, guys.

25:28.243 --> 25:30.545
Monty, we--
we can't let you do this.

25:30.579 --> 25:32.947
Stand back,
government man.

25:32.981 --> 25:36.284
Rise! Rise up!

25:36.318 --> 25:37.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:37.352 --> 25:39.287
Pete!

25:42.424 --> 25:45.793
I can't control it.

25:45.828 --> 25:48.763
Monty, where are you going?
Come back.

25:48.796 --> 25:50.831
- Hey, get me down.
- Pete?

26:06.319 --> 26:07.586
[Laughs]

26:08.205 --> 26:12.170
Pete!
This isn't funny.

26:12.248 --> 26:15.275
This is the awesomest
artifact whammy ever.

26:15.327 --> 26:19.030
How awesome will it be when
you asphyxiate in the clouds?

26:19.288 --> 26:21.423
- A lot less awesome?
- Yes.

26:21.457 --> 26:22.824
Are you all right?

26:22.858 --> 26:25.360
- I'm a little gassy.
- Where is Monty?

26:25.394 --> 26:28.563
He ran off.
I think he was scared.

26:28.597 --> 26:29.764
What? Scared?
Why?

26:29.799 --> 26:31.066
We're not going to hurt him.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.834
I don't think that
he meant to levitate you,

26:32.868 --> 26:35.003
and if he thought that
he couldn't control his trick--

26:35.037 --> 26:38.006
well, it might
have scared him.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.541
Does he have
a dressing room here?

26:39.575 --> 26:42.343
No, he probably
just went home.

26:42.378 --> 26:44.012
Nobody's here, Myks.

26:44.046 --> 26:46.881
Monty's room is clean except
for a bunch of heart medication.

26:46.916 --> 26:48.483
The guy's hanging on
by a thread.

26:48.517 --> 26:51.052
You know, his assistant,
Rose, never told us

26:51.087 --> 26:53.288
- that she lived here.
- Ooh, nice.

26:53.322 --> 26:55.223
No wonder he's got
a heart condition.

26:55.257 --> 26:57.959
Man, I hope I have a hot, young
girlfriend when I'm his age.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.727
Well, it's good that
you have a five-year plan.

26:59.762 --> 27:03.731
No, Pete, I think that
she's his--his granddaughter.

27:03.766 --> 27:04.766
Now it's a turnoff.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.668
Check this out.

27:06.702 --> 27:08.369
Saint Joseph of Cupertino.

27:08.404 --> 27:10.605
Cupertino, California,
has a saint?

27:10.639 --> 27:11.706
[Laughs] No.

27:11.740 --> 27:13.174
It's a 17th century friar.

27:13.209 --> 27:14.943
He was said to be able
to levitate.

27:14.977 --> 27:17.479
Oh. Okay.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.414
So hot, young granddaughter

27:19.448 --> 27:22.083
finds magic Cupertino
floaty thing

27:22.118 --> 27:23.818
and gives it
to loveable, sick grandpa.

27:23.853 --> 27:25.220
It'd be a great present
for someone

27:25.254 --> 27:27.522
who's always dreamt
of finding real magic.

27:27.556 --> 27:29.824
Yeah, but Myks,
he was so sure

27:29.859 --> 27:31.059
that he did himself.

27:31.093 --> 27:33.328
Wouldn't it be a better gift
not to tell him?

27:33.362 --> 27:35.730
And let him believe
it is real magic?

27:35.764 --> 27:37.132
[Snaps fingers]
Right.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.100
And she knew Monty
wouldn't come here.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.102
Needed us out of the way,
but why?

27:41.137 --> 27:44.005
So she could run?
I mean, that doesn't feel right.

27:44.039 --> 27:47.142
No, no, she's doing this
for Monty.

27:47.176 --> 27:50.345
Pete, what if Rose
wanted to give her grandfather

27:50.379 --> 27:52.080
a last hurrah.

27:52.114 --> 27:55.216
Something so that this town
will always remember

27:55.251 --> 27:56.851
Monty The Magnificent.

27:56.886 --> 27:58.953
Like maybe an outdoor
promotional event.

27:58.988 --> 28:01.623
Myks, we told Monty that Val
couldn't make it tonight.

28:01.657 --> 28:03.791
Let's go.

28:05.628 --> 28:08.396
Knew I'd find you here.

28:09.865 --> 28:12.934
The government fella?
Is he all right?

28:12.968 --> 28:14.269
He's with the government.

28:14.303 --> 28:16.504
It's their job to pretend
that things

28:16.539 --> 28:20.208
that they don't understand
are dangerous.

28:22.711 --> 28:26.314
Sweetheart,
I think I'm done.

28:26.348 --> 28:28.483
Gramps, don't say that.

28:28.517 --> 28:31.386
Mm-mm.
Listen.

28:31.420 --> 28:34.222
Adorable Rose,

28:34.256 --> 28:38.226
when your eyes go,
you stop painting.

28:38.260 --> 28:42.630
When your knees go,
you stop dancing.

28:42.665 --> 28:47.635
And when you can't do
what you do best,

28:47.670 --> 28:50.004
you walk away with dignity.

28:50.039 --> 28:51.239
That's ridiculous.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.509
Look, maybe you can't
levitate yourself.

28:54.543 --> 28:57.812
Maybe, you know, you were
thinking about that man,

28:57.846 --> 28:59.714
and that's why he went up.

28:59.748 --> 29:03.985
We used to fill this place,
your grandma and I.

29:04.019 --> 29:08.156
Standing room only.

29:08.190 --> 29:12.827
[Applause]

29:12.861 --> 29:14.629
Well, then let's
prove to the world

29:14.663 --> 29:16.197
that you're
the greatest there is,

29:16.232 --> 29:20.468
and then
walk away with dignity.

29:20.502 --> 29:23.338
I'm not gonna put
anyone else in danger.

29:23.372 --> 29:24.973
No, there's no danger.

29:25.007 --> 29:27.709
Use me.
I trust you.

29:27.743 --> 29:30.378
You know, I hear
Val Preston's disappeared.

29:30.412 --> 29:32.647
Might not even show up
for his Val-apalooza.

29:32.681 --> 29:34.215
Yeah, that's what
they said too.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.384
So we'll steal his audience.

29:36.418 --> 29:38.653
Levitate me outside.

29:38.687 --> 29:40.355
We'll knock their socks off.

29:40.389 --> 29:43.925
"Steal his audience"?

29:43.959 --> 29:45.727
Now you're talking.

29:45.761 --> 29:47.195
[Laughs]

29:47.229 --> 29:50.765
I have no idea why those
particular horses are winning.

29:50.799 --> 29:52.533
I know that you're
telling the truth,

29:52.568 --> 29:53.701
but what about
their injuries?

29:53.736 --> 29:56.004
Were there any similarities
between them?

29:56.038 --> 29:59.274
No, the first one
had a leg strain,

29:59.308 --> 30:01.709
the second one had lacerations
on her abdomen,

30:01.744 --> 30:03.344
and the third one
had minor burns

30:03.379 --> 30:04.345
on the back of his neck.

30:04.380 --> 30:05.580
What, burns?

30:05.614 --> 30:08.082
Some jockeys use
a small, handheld device

30:08.117 --> 30:10.418
called the box that delivers
an electrical charge.

30:10.452 --> 30:12.720
It makes the horses
run harder.

30:12.755 --> 30:13.755
Is that even legal?

30:13.789 --> 30:15.990
Of course not.
It's barbaric.

30:16.025 --> 30:17.492
If I ever caught
a jockey using one,

30:17.526 --> 30:19.794
- I'd apply it to his testicles.
- Word.

30:19.828 --> 30:21.629
Were the other injuries
caused by abuse?

30:21.664 --> 30:23.131
Probably.

30:23.165 --> 30:25.333
The leg strain can come
from running an animal

30:25.367 --> 30:26.601
harder than necessary

30:26.635 --> 30:30.104
and the lacerations
from an illegally long whip,

30:30.139 --> 30:32.573
but all very difficult
to prove.

30:32.608 --> 30:34.876
What if somebody saw this,
knew they couldn't prove it,

30:34.910 --> 30:36.577
wanted to do something
about it.

30:36.612 --> 30:38.179
And punish
the abusive jockey.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.815
How did these injuries
come to your attention?

30:40.849 --> 30:43.618
Well, my assistant
takes all of the bookings.

30:43.652 --> 30:45.586
Can I have a look?

30:45.621 --> 30:48.089
[Phone beeps]
Right.

30:48.123 --> 30:50.591
Interesting.

30:50.626 --> 30:53.161
All three injuries were reported
by the same stable boy,

30:53.195 --> 30:55.296
a Ricky Jackson.

30:55.331 --> 30:58.733
Has Ricky reported any other
abused horses recently?

30:58.767 --> 31:00.168
Devil's share.

31:00.202 --> 31:02.770
Just in last night
with a bruised deltoid.

31:02.805 --> 31:04.939
Obviously, his jockey
cropped him far too hard.

31:04.973 --> 31:06.441
Devil's share's
in the next race.

31:06.475 --> 31:07.608
You find this Ricky kid.

31:07.643 --> 31:09.143
I'm gonna stop
that horse from running.

31:09.178 --> 31:11.412
Yes!
Cupertino's medal.

31:11.447 --> 31:12.914
It hasn't been seen
in centuries.

31:12.948 --> 31:14.615
Rumored to give the bearer
the power

31:14.650 --> 31:16.284
to levitate
whoever they choose.

31:16.318 --> 31:18.152
Well, rumor confirmed.

31:18.187 --> 31:21.322
But why are people
shooting up into the sky?

31:21.357 --> 31:22.757
Well, that's inconclusive,

31:22.791 --> 31:26.828
and Cupertino was not in control
of his ability to levitate.

31:26.862 --> 31:28.963
In fact, the church banned him
from public ceremonies.

31:28.997 --> 31:30.998
They were afraid that he
would incite chaos.

31:31.033 --> 31:32.934
Well, maybe that's
the downside.

31:32.968 --> 31:35.803
The victims of levitation
later lose control.

31:35.838 --> 31:37.705
Yeah, something's gotta
trigger these victims

31:37.740 --> 31:39.073
going up a second time.

31:39.108 --> 31:41.576
Yeah, well, let's look into
that ASAP, shall we?

31:41.610 --> 31:44.078
Yeah, if we don't bag
this artifact soon,

31:44.113 --> 31:45.980
Pete here is hopping
the stairway to heaven.

31:46.014 --> 31:48.783
It's "buying."

31:48.817 --> 31:50.418
"Buying the stairway
to heaven."

31:50.452 --> 31:52.754
Well, I'm not
a Rolling Stones expert.

31:52.788 --> 31:53.788
Oh, no.

31:53.822 --> 31:56.124
In any case,
make sure that--

31:58.327 --> 31:59.794
Go ahead.
I'll wait.

31:59.828 --> 32:01.396
Artie, who's there?

32:01.430 --> 32:03.531
[Sighs]
No one.

32:03.565 --> 32:04.966
Just make sure
you keep a roof

32:05.000 --> 32:06.868
over Pete's head
until you bag the artifact.

32:06.902 --> 32:08.936
Pancho Villa's boots.

32:08.971 --> 32:11.305
You're here to check them out
like this is a library?

32:11.340 --> 32:12.507
You're hilarious.

32:12.541 --> 32:14.876
Mr. Villa committed
unconscionable acts

32:14.910 --> 32:17.145
in these boots, and yet
he was never bothered by them.

32:17.179 --> 32:18.246
It imbued him with--

32:18.280 --> 32:19.814
The power to numb
any grief or guilt

32:19.848 --> 32:21.916
caused by one's own actions.

32:21.950 --> 32:24.051
I am not the one
that is new here.

32:24.086 --> 32:26.554
I know about this, Artie.

32:26.588 --> 32:29.824
A man who insists on fighting
his battle alone,

32:29.858 --> 32:32.894
who shuts everyone out until
his grief consumes him

32:32.928 --> 32:34.162
and there's nothing left

32:34.196 --> 32:37.198
but fury and sadness
and self-loathing.

32:37.232 --> 32:39.100
I'm glad I'm so easy
to categorize.

32:39.134 --> 32:42.103
Why don't you just
save everyone the torment

32:42.137 --> 32:44.605
of watching you self-destruct
and put on the boots?

32:44.640 --> 32:48.276
So the Regents briefed you
on exactly what happened.

32:48.310 --> 32:49.911
That does not mean
you know me.

32:49.945 --> 32:53.347
I don't know you.
Only your struggle.

32:53.382 --> 32:55.817
I know this because
I have seen it.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.385
I've lived it.

32:57.419 --> 32:59.821
And I promised myself
I would never put myself

32:59.855 --> 33:01.355
in the position to live
through it again.

33:01.390 --> 33:03.024
And yet, here I am,
trying to save the life

33:03.058 --> 33:04.192
of yet another man who--

33:04.226 --> 33:06.427
No, no, no, no, no.
No need to save me.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.795
- I'm fine.
- Yes, yes, yes.

33:07.830 --> 33:11.032
That's exactly what he said,
and then I lost him.

33:14.703 --> 33:17.705
A patient.

33:19.107 --> 33:22.076
Grief, Agent Nielson,

33:22.110 --> 33:24.846
real, gut-wrenching grief

33:24.880 --> 33:27.782
is not something you
can power through or ignore.

33:27.816 --> 33:30.485
There's no detours,
no shortcuts.

33:30.519 --> 33:33.588
You look it in the eye
and you do battle,

33:33.622 --> 33:36.424
and you keep doing battle
until you are finished with it,

33:36.458 --> 33:38.092
and it is finished
with you.

33:38.126 --> 33:40.761
And if you're not willing
to accept that,

33:40.796 --> 33:44.599
then it will eat you alive.

33:50.138 --> 33:54.876
And yes, he was a patient.

33:59.414 --> 34:04.585
[Overlapping chatter]

34:09.458 --> 34:11.759
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

34:11.793 --> 34:14.762
Hello?

34:16.331 --> 34:18.866
Hello.

34:18.900 --> 34:23.304
Seems that Val's
not gonna make it.

34:23.338 --> 34:25.339
[Audience ohs]

34:25.373 --> 34:26.940
But I am.

34:26.975 --> 34:30.777
I am Monty The Magnificent!

34:30.812 --> 34:36.117
[Cheers and applause]

34:36.150 --> 34:41.054
And assisted
by my lovely Rose,

34:41.089 --> 34:44.559
I will dazzle you
with something never before seen

34:44.592 --> 34:47.061
on a scale this size.

34:47.094 --> 34:49.996
Real magic.

34:50.032 --> 34:53.367
No wires,
no hidden platforms.

34:53.402 --> 34:56.871
Real magic
has nothing to hide.

34:56.905 --> 35:02.076
Tonight, I will levitate
this beautiful young lady

35:02.110 --> 35:03.511
across the entire Plaza.

35:03.545 --> 35:04.512
- That's right, folks.
- Pete!

35:04.546 --> 35:05.746
What?

35:05.781 --> 35:06.747
We still don't know
what triggers people

35:06.782 --> 35:07.848
shooting into
the stratosphere.

35:07.883 --> 35:08.983
You can't be out here
in the open air.

35:09.017 --> 35:10.217
Aww, come on, coach.

35:10.252 --> 35:11.485
It's the fourth quarter--
don't bench me.

35:11.520 --> 35:14.522
Pete, I left cookies
in the glove compartment.

35:14.556 --> 35:16.691
Ooh.

35:16.725 --> 35:18.926
To do this,
I need all of you to put

35:18.961 --> 35:20.695
your hand over your hearts.

35:20.729 --> 35:23.230
[Car beeps]
Liar!

35:23.265 --> 35:24.398
You too, sonny.

35:24.433 --> 35:25.666
[Laughter]

35:25.701 --> 35:30.438
Focus on Rose.

35:30.472 --> 35:33.207
And on my command,

35:33.241 --> 35:38.679
you and I will lift her up
into the air together.

35:38.714 --> 35:40.414
Pete, Rose has it.

35:40.449 --> 35:44.051
Now rise up.

35:44.086 --> 35:45.920
It's on a chain
around her neck.

35:45.954 --> 35:47.288
All right, all right,
that's good to know.

35:47.322 --> 35:49.357
[Audience ohs]

35:49.391 --> 35:54.395
[Cheers and applause]

36:01.803 --> 36:05.606
Now what's the--

36:05.640 --> 36:06.740
Oh, no.

36:13.815 --> 36:17.018
Oh!

36:17.052 --> 36:20.388
Myks!

36:20.422 --> 36:23.290
I think I found out
what the trigger is.

36:31.497 --> 36:32.730
Pete, what are you doing?

36:32.765 --> 36:35.433
Ah, this is probably
a bad idea.

36:35.467 --> 36:36.634
You think?

36:36.669 --> 36:38.203
Tonight's forecast:

36:38.237 --> 36:41.406
Cloudy with
a 40% chance of Pete!

36:41.440 --> 36:43.241
Aah!

36:44.643 --> 36:47.111
Oh, my God!
Let go of my arm.

36:47.146 --> 36:49.614
[Cheers and applause]

36:49.648 --> 36:50.949
How'd you get up here?

36:50.983 --> 36:53.251
Look, I know
it's for Monty, okay?

36:53.285 --> 36:54.853
But every time you do this,

36:54.887 --> 36:56.921
someone shoots up
into the sky and dies.

36:56.956 --> 36:59.457
What?
No, that's--that's impossible.

36:59.491 --> 37:01.459
Unless you take us down
and hand that thing over,

37:01.493 --> 37:02.660
I'm next.

37:02.695 --> 37:05.263
Oh, my gosh,
this is gonna crush Monty.

37:05.297 --> 37:07.031
Only if I fall on him.

37:07.066 --> 37:10.268
Look, we wwn't tell him, okay?
I promise.

37:10.302 --> 37:13.605
Just take us down.

37:24.583 --> 37:25.984
Excuse me.
Thank you.

37:26.018 --> 37:27.785
Myka, wait.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.821
[Thud]

37:32.591 --> 37:34.325
He said
you wouldn't tell him.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.394
Please,
Monty has to believe.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.229
Believe?

37:38.264 --> 37:41.332
In what?

37:44.036 --> 37:49.207
Oh, so what
I thought was real magic

37:49.241 --> 37:53.344
was in fact
just some cheap trick?

37:53.379 --> 37:55.480
And you two came here
to confiscate it?

37:55.514 --> 37:58.683
No, no, Monty.
It--it's real.

37:58.717 --> 38:00.952
It's--it's--

38:00.986 --> 38:03.454
- Myks?
- I--

38:03.489 --> 38:07.025
Like they say,

38:07.059 --> 38:10.795
there's no fool
like an old fool.

38:10.829 --> 38:14.198
Gramps.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.210
Ricky Jackson?

38:28.547 --> 38:31.449
I know why you are doing this,
but it has to stop.

38:31.483 --> 38:32.517
They're getting
what they deserve.

38:32.551 --> 38:33.518
Yeah, maybe they are,

38:33.552 --> 38:34.652
but you're not
judge and jury.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.187
Now we're pulling
devil's share.

38:36.221 --> 38:37.655
And this is stopping, Ricky.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.157
Have you seen what the jockeys
do to these innocent animals?

38:39.191 --> 38:42.560
It's awful.
They should be punished.

38:42.594 --> 38:43.962
Yeah,
what if one of them dies?

38:43.996 --> 38:45.563
Do they deserve to die?

38:45.597 --> 38:49.367
Are you a murderer, Ricky?

38:49.401 --> 38:52.804
Come on.
Just tell me what you're using.

38:55.908 --> 38:57.775
It's an old piece
of an Indian blanket.

38:57.810 --> 38:58.776
It was Sitting Bull's.

38:58.811 --> 38:59.777
It should be underneath
the saddle.

38:59.812 --> 39:00.812
<i>[ Call To The Post ]</i>

39:00.846 --> 39:02.146
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:02.181 --> 39:04.816
our next race
will be the 68th running...

39:04.850 --> 39:06.317
Oy.
Yeah, you.

39:06.352 --> 39:07.318
You gotta get off that horse.

39:07.353 --> 39:08.453
Are you mad?
Get off the track.

39:08.487 --> 39:09.454
I'm from
the racing commission,

39:09.488 --> 39:10.588
and I said dismount.

39:10.622 --> 39:11.656
And I said piss off.

39:13.192 --> 39:14.392
What the bloody hell
are you doing?

39:14.426 --> 39:15.393
I'm trying to save
your ungrateful ass.

39:15.427 --> 39:17.161
Claudia?
Where'd you go?

39:17.196 --> 39:18.663
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, oh, oh!

39:18.697 --> 39:19.897
Oh, my God!

39:19.932 --> 39:22.233
Feel that? See?

39:22.267 --> 39:26.270
That's a really bad feeling.

39:33.712 --> 39:36.848
[Electricity crackles]

39:42.921 --> 39:44.455
Listen.

39:44.490 --> 39:46.724
You ever mistreat
a horse again,

39:46.759 --> 39:48.159
I'll send you
to the glue factory.

39:48.193 --> 39:50.762
Tell your friends.
[Horse whinnies]

39:50.796 --> 39:53.531
Are you all right?

39:53.565 --> 39:57.435
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

39:57.469 --> 39:58.436
Thank you.

39:58.470 --> 39:59.537
Thank goodness.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.939
I mean, you gave us
quite a start.

40:08.514 --> 40:10.348
[Phone chirps]

40:13.867 --> 40:15.898
It's right in here, Monty.

40:20.992 --> 40:22.492
Robert Houdin--

40:22.527 --> 40:24.928
they called him the father
of modern magic.

40:24.962 --> 40:28.064
It was the 1840s,
and no.

40:28.099 --> 40:30.233
I did not know him personally.

40:30.268 --> 40:31.434
[Laughs]

40:34.372 --> 40:37.240
Harry Blackstone, Sr's
light bulb.

40:37.275 --> 40:38.341
[Laughs]

40:38.376 --> 40:40.228
Another cheap trick.

40:45.917 --> 40:50.587
There's no tricks here,
Monty.

40:50.621 --> 40:52.422
The world is full of magic.

40:52.456 --> 40:55.559
Real magic.

40:55.593 --> 41:00.096
Most people
just aren't ready for it.

41:00.131 --> 41:01.698
You're one of the few people

41:01.732 --> 41:02.766
who have seen this place.

41:02.800 --> 41:06.636
We figured that
you could keep a secret.

41:06.671 --> 41:09.206
You know, I could
put together a whole new act.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.674
No, that's not what--

41:10.708 --> 41:12.409
Oh, oh--

41:12.443 --> 41:13.710
just kidding.

41:13.744 --> 41:14.945
[Both chuckle]

41:14.979 --> 41:17.214
Huh, this guy.

41:17.248 --> 41:19.316
Well, you want to see
some more stuff?

41:19.350 --> 41:21.017
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:26.591 --> 41:28.291
Yeah, I know.

41:28.326 --> 41:31.528
The kid was just trying
to protect the animals he loves.

41:31.562 --> 41:32.896
Yeah, people do
all kinds of things

41:32.930 --> 41:34.264
when they want
to protect somebody.

41:34.298 --> 41:35.866
Are you reaching wildly
for a metaphor

41:35.900 --> 41:37.167
over tattling on Artie?

41:37.201 --> 41:38.401
Who? Me?

41:38.436 --> 41:40.170
Look, I get it.

41:40.204 --> 41:42.606
You're worried about
the animal we all love.

41:42.640 --> 41:45.508
But still,
you should have told me.

41:45.543 --> 41:46.676
[Thunder crashes]

41:46.711 --> 41:47.911
What the hell was that?

41:47.945 --> 41:50.213
Karma?

41:50.248 --> 41:52.182
[Imitates whinnying]

41:52.216 --> 41:54.551
[Laughs mockingly]

42:06.058 --> 42:08.464
What am I doing here?

42:19.243 --> 42:21.778
I killed someone I loved.

42:21.812 --> 42:25.515
I don't know
what to do about it.

42:26.103 --> 42:27.988
Let's talk.

42:30.021 --> 42:32.422
[Exhales]
