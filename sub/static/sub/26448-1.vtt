01:03.931 --> 01:05.431
- Help!

01:05.533 --> 01:06.231
Help!

01:07.501 --> 01:08.367
Help, someone!

01:09.737 --> 01:10.502
Help!

01:25.453 --> 01:27.352
Maddy your going to be late.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.456
Coming mom.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.561
I could walk to
school, you know.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.730
It's only five blocks away.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.799
- I prefer to take you.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.501
That way, I know
you got there safe.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.003
- Mom, you're gonna have
to let me go at some point.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.304
I'm turning 18 in a few months.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.472
I'm almost an adult.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.508
- Yeah well, turning
18 doesn't give you

02:22.610 --> 02:25.277
automatic good judgment
and experience.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.379
You have to learn those things.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.752
- And how am I supposed to

02:33.854 --> 02:35.354
if you never let me
do anything on my own?

02:35.456 --> 02:40.459
- Honey, the world is
full of dangerous people.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.562
I just don't think you're
ready to deal with it all yet.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.964
- Maybe you're the one
not ready to deal with it.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.768
Hey, let's call Dad.
- Honey, I don't know if his

02:49.870 --> 02:52.070
plane has landed yet.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.505
- Hey Dad!

02:53.607 --> 02:55.774
- Hey, kiddo!
- Say hi to Mom.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.075
- Hi!
- Hey, babe.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.510
- How's everything?
- Yeah, it's fine.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.445
I just checked in to the hotel.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.214
I got a meeting in like an hour.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.917
- Sounds good, let
me know how it goes.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.952
Oh, the permit office called.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.520
They weren't too thrilled
with the blueprints

03:08.622 --> 03:10.122
we submitted last week.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.590
- Dad, can I go to a
party at Nicole's tonight?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.025
- I already told you no.
- But why?

03:13.127 --> 03:14.793
My grades are almost all
A's, except for math,

03:14.895 --> 03:16.261
I finished all my
college essays,

03:16.363 --> 03:18.363
and I'm two sections
ahead in my SAT prep.

03:18.465 --> 03:19.531
- 'Cause I know for a fact

03:19.633 --> 03:21.066
that Nicole's parents
are in the Bahamas

03:21.168 --> 03:24.403
and you are too young to go to
a party that's unsupervised.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.104
- Being a cop made you paranoid.

03:26.207 --> 03:29.274
- Yeah listen honey,
can you handle that,

03:29.376 --> 03:31.476
since you're there and
you're the one that said no?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.744
- Okay, just don't
forget to ask them

03:32.846 --> 03:34.980
why the materials are so cheap.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.983
The permit office is
worried that they're subpar.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.318
- You got it, I'll do just that.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.919
Alright, I'll talk
to you guys later.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.654
Hey Maddy, listen to your mom.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.122
- Yeah, whatever.
- Bye.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.793
- I was a hostage
negotiator, not a cop.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.463
And I'm protective of you
because I know what's out there.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.907
Okay, so I will meet you at 4:00

04:02.009 --> 04:04.109
for your meeting
with Mr. Hammer?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.477
- Fine.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.345
- Hey.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.447
I love you.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.982
- So that's why you embarrass me

04:10.084 --> 04:11.817
by dropping me off at
school like I'm a freshman?

04:11.919 --> 04:14.286
- I liked you a lot better
when you didn't talk back.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.089
- Perfect, I'll never
talk to you again.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.589
- Ha ha, very funny.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.726
Laughing all the way to work.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.686
Good morning.
- Oh wait, she just walked in.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.487
Good morning, Alice.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.055
I have Tony Materelli

04:50.157 --> 04:52.658
on the phone for you.
- Tony, what is his deal?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.826
- Um--
- Rhetorical question.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.128
- I'll put her through.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.899
- Hey, Tony.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.404
Yes.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.072
I'm sure he will be there.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.609
Yes, he has other
meetings today.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.911
Okay.

05:13.013 --> 05:13.845
Alright, will do.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.280
I'm sure he will be there.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.281
Talk to you later.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.320
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, strange.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.689
Tony from the construction
company called.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.424
Said he went to pick
up Brent at the airport

05:25.526 --> 05:26.591
and he wasn't there.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.026
- Oh, he already
checked into his hotel.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.162
He doesn't meet with
them until tomorrow.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.531
- Did he call you?

05:32.633 --> 05:33.999
- No, I called him.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.001
I had a question
about the electrician.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.669
- Ah, okay.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.171
Well, he seemed very worried

05:39.273 --> 05:41.306
like Brent didn't
actually make the meeting.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.675
- I don't know.

05:45.713 --> 05:49.448
- Hey, I'm sorry you
didn't get to go.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.582
I know you were counting on it.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.018
It's just, I have
so much work here

05:53.120 --> 05:54.720
while Brent is in New York.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.054
- I totally understand.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.823
That's what assistants are for.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.964
- Let's see here ...

06:12.840 --> 06:14.606
- Large skinny latte
with two shots for Alice.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.674
- Thank you.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.010
- Whoa!
- Oh geez, I'm so sorry.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.747
Steve!
- Alice!

06:22.983 --> 06:24.416
It's not the first time
you've spilled coffee on me.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.717
- I am so sorry.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.252
- No you didn't get--
- Did I get you?

06:27.354 --> 06:28.954
- It's fine, let
me call you back.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.823
How are ya?
- Great!

06:31.925 --> 06:33.258
- Yeah?
- I'm great, yeah.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.127
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.628
- You got a minute,
you wanna sit?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.029
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.603
- So, I see you can't
get away from uniforms.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.671
- Yeah, it's my
calling, you know?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.006
How's civilian
life treating you?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.408
- It's good.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.643
Three years have flown by.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.811
- Three years, wow.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.579
And Maddy must be a
what, a junior now?

06:54.681 --> 06:56.281
- She just started senior year.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.784
- Senior year, that was fast.
- Crazy.

06:58.886 --> 06:59.985
- Can I get you
something over here?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.654
- Uh yeah, could I
get a double espresso?

07:02.756 --> 07:03.922
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.592
And how's Brent?
- Yeah, he's, he's Brent.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.027
A mover and a shaker.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.264
We are trying for a new
development deal on the Strip,

07:12.366 --> 07:15.400
so he's in New York meeting
with contractors and investors.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.836
- Some things never change.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.505
- Some things do.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.207
- Sometimes.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.644
- It was good to see you, Steve.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.846
- Yeah, it was really
good to see you, Alice.

07:29.883 --> 07:33.251
Hey Alice listen, if you ever
need anything, I'm around.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.119
- I know.

07:40.928 --> 07:44.162
- So as you can
see, she's right on track.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.031
- But the math.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.799
- It's not that important
when you're applying

07:47.901 --> 07:49.334
for creative writing programs.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.836
- Yes.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.871
Can we talk about the
practicalities of this major?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.339
- Mom!

07:54.441 --> 07:56.641
- I want you to be able to
get a job when you graduate.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.210
- There are many options.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.045
Most students that
graduate from Ainsley

08:00.147 --> 08:02.681
they already have
books commissioned.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.216
- Ainsley,

08:04.318 --> 08:07.219
as in Ainsley College
in New York City?

08:07.321 --> 08:10.889
- Yes, well, technically
in Brooklyn, but...

08:10.991 --> 08:12.057
- Mom just--

08:12.159 --> 08:13.492
- We'll talk about
this when we get home.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.926
- Yeah, right.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.661
- I believe in Maddy.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.763
She'll be fine no
matter what she does.

08:19.867 --> 08:20.899
- Right.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.182
You're not ready to be on the
other side of the country.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.885
- Dad is there for work
literally all the time.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.019
- What if,

08:42.222 --> 08:45.090
what if you need us and
we can't get to you?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.960
Plus, there are plenty of
excellent schools here.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.297
- It's the one I wanna go to.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.499
Plus, Josh says I'd
meet the right people.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.537
- Josh, first name basis?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.438
- What, he's nice!

09:00.541 --> 09:01.873
- I bet.
- Hey, kiddo.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.075
How was your day?
- Awful.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.912
Mom won't let me go to the
college I want to apply to.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.947
- Okay, well uh, look,

09:09.049 --> 09:10.949
I've actually had a
really long day myself,

09:11.051 --> 09:13.318
and I got a lot of
meetings tomorrow.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.253
So, can we talk about
this when I get home?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.454
- Did you even hear what I said?

09:16.557 --> 09:17.489
- Yes, I did.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.723
Uh, college,

09:18.825 --> 09:21.159
and your mom and I will discuss.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.627
- Fine!

09:22.729 --> 09:23.962
No one cares what I want.

09:24.064 --> 09:24.863
- I care!

09:25.966 --> 09:27.899
- Yeah, about work, and money.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.280
- Hi.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.683
- Will you lighten up on
her a little bit please?

09:44.785 --> 09:47.986
- She's not ready to be in
New York City all by herself.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.654
- Look, you've always
been overprotective,

09:49.756 --> 09:52.157
but honestly, it's getting to
a point where it's ridiculous.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.192
Kid doesn't have a
chance to breathe!

09:54.294 --> 09:56.027
- New York, no way!

09:56.129 --> 09:57.796
- LA is not much
better than New York.

09:57.898 --> 09:58.964
- You know what?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.366
Let's sidebar this.
- Whatever you say.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.837
- I'm just trying to get her
to adulthood safely, okay?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.005
And alive.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.208
Tony Materelli called
the office today.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.543
- What did he want?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.278
- Said he went to pick
you up at the airport

10:13.380 --> 10:14.112
and you weren't there.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.680
- He said that?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.617
- Yeah, something about wanting
to show you around New York,

10:18.719 --> 10:19.818
like you haven't
been there before.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.853
You are in New York, right?

10:21.955 --> 10:22.821
- Where else would I be?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.155
- I don't know.

10:24.257 --> 10:24.889
You don't have the
best track record

10:24.992 --> 10:25.957
of telling me the truth.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.959
- Okay, Tony is Tony, he's--

10:28.061 --> 10:30.395
- He's a shady
guy is what he is.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.830
- He's paying us a lot of money.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.898
- Yeah, money coming
from God knows where.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.668
- You really wanna do this now?

10:36.770 --> 10:39.137
- You know what?

10:39.239 --> 10:42.841
It's late, you
should get some rest.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.809
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.811
Just don't forget to tell them--

10:46.913 --> 10:49.748
- I know, I know, check about
the materials, I got it.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.049
- I'm just trying to help.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.017
- I know you are, okay?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.918
I'll handle everything here.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.053
You handle Maddy.

10:56.123 --> 10:56.855
I love you.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.089
- I love you too.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.907
- Large
cheese, extra pepperoni.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.308
- Thanks.
- You got it.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.149
- Hey!

11:27.821 --> 11:30.689
Losing it.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.361
- What?
- Hey Maddy?

11:37.631 --> 11:42.033
Honey, pizza's here.
- I'm not hungry.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.301
- What did you eat today?

11:43.403 --> 11:46.938
- Hmm, nine cheeseburgers,
a box of cookies,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.707
and not a single vegetable.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.608
You wanna see the receipts?

11:50.711 --> 11:52.811
- Did you do your homework?
- No.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.946
- Maddy!
- Mom, yes!

11:55.048 --> 11:58.016
That was a joke.
- Very funny.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.384
I love you.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.178
- What did Josh say to your mom?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.980
- He told her he thought
I could get into Ainsley.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.015
She like freaked out.
- Of course she did.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.050
Tell her to take whatever's
lodged up her ass, out!

13:06.153 --> 13:07.652
- Seriously, she knows all
I wanna do is go there,

13:07.754 --> 13:08.453
and get away from her.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.687
It's so annoying.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.856
She wants me to be able
to get a stable job.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.724
- Why?

13:12.826 --> 13:14.192
That school is amazing.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.660
My dad would be so happy if
I could even get in there.

13:15.762 --> 13:16.995
- I don't know.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.463
She thinks I should
stay home for college,

13:18.565 --> 13:20.198
'cause she doesn't think I'm
ready to go out on my own.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
- What are you, 12?
- She thinks I'm 10.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.669
- Man, your mom's got issues.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.037
- Hey Nicole, can I
have some of this?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.205
- Yeah, go for it.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.141
- Can I get some of that?
- Mmhmm.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.242
- You should take a shot.
- No.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.744
- Come on, Maddy.
- No, I'm just fine.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.546
- Is that you saying
no, or your mom?

13:34.648 --> 13:36.948
- I'm just kinda tired.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.118
- You don't look tired to me.
- I'm really just not thirsty.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.922
- Ooh, it's tasty.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.224
- Next time, I promise.
- Yeah right.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.659
- I think I'm gonna go, though.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.494
- Okay, be safe.
- See you tomorrow.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.695
Be safe.
- Okay.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.097
- Text me when you get home.
- Bye.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.699
- Wow.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.167
I can't believe it.
- I know.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.808
- Good night, honey.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.224
- Stop!

14:53.326 --> 14:54.058
Help!

14:55.495 --> 15:00.531
Help!

16:11.071 --> 16:13.871
- Hey, cutie, you're
at the office early.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.206
- I wanted to make
sure to be here

16:15.308 --> 16:17.442
in case you needed anything.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.510
- What would I do without you?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.012
- I don't know.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.514
You haven't been spending
much time with me lately.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.550
- Is this about you
not coming to New York?

16:25.652 --> 16:28.653
- We were gonna have a
romantic week together.

16:28.755 --> 16:32.557
Champagne, hot tub, remember?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.860
- I know, I know, but
you know, things came up.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.662
- You said that last time.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.131
- Look, it turned out
to be a very busy trip,

16:40.233 --> 16:41.532
back to back meetings,

16:41.634 --> 16:43.301
we wouldn't have any time
to spend together anyway.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.470
And besides, Alice is in LA.

16:45.572 --> 16:49.240
- Alice, can she do
anything herself?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.809
- You are our assistant.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.245
- Really?
- Yes, really.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.714
- You're never gonna leave her.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.916
Brent?

16:59.019 --> 17:01.652
Are you or are you not?

17:01.755 --> 17:03.788
I'm so tired of
this back and forth.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.123
- I will, okay?

17:06.626 --> 17:07.724
And then you and I can
run the business together,

17:07.827 --> 17:08.859
but it's not the
right time right now.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.928
- It's never the right time.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.097
I knew when you canceled
my ticket to New York

17:13.199 --> 17:14.598
that you weren't
gonna follow through

17:14.701 --> 17:16.099
with any of your promises.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.702
- Victoria, listen to me.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.439
- No, I will not listen
to anymore of your lies

17:21.540 --> 17:23.007
and broken promises.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.409
- Okay, so Costa Rica?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.044
Costa Rica was a lie?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.079
I remember that being
a very good time.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.014
- That was two years ago.

17:30.116 --> 17:30.915
- Look, I have to go.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.350
I gotta get to a meeting.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.018
Can we talk about this later?

17:34.120 --> 17:34.919
- Fine!

17:42.162 --> 17:43.428
- Yes, I'm en route,

17:43.530 --> 17:44.762
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

17:45.999 --> 17:46.831
He said what?

17:58.812 --> 18:00.044
- Maddy!

18:01.448 --> 18:03.114
You're gonna be late!

18:13.059 --> 18:13.858
Maddy!

18:15.028 --> 18:18.129
Maddy, why are you still in bed?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.864
Maddy, wake up, honey.

18:23.036 --> 18:25.970
Maddy, we don't
have time for this today.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.051
Maddy, are you trying
on those shoes again?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.689
Where are you?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.631
Maddy, where are you?

19:26.733 --> 19:27.465
- Mom?
- Honey?

19:29.235 --> 19:30.101
Are you okay?

19:31.638 --> 19:32.937
What's wrong?

19:33.039 --> 19:33.905
- Someone has me.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.375
- What do you mean
someone has you?

19:37.477 --> 19:39.143
- I was kidnapped.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.545
- What?

19:40.647 --> 19:41.812
What are you talking about?

19:41.915 --> 19:42.847
Who took you?

19:42.949 --> 19:43.881
- I don't know.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.449
They had a knife to me.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.518
- Oh my god.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.724
Maddy, listen to me.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.327
Everything is gonna be okay.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.164
Ask him how much he wants.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.567
- How much do you want?

20:05.038 --> 20:07.605
He says, don't call the police.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.675
- Maddy, Maddy, listen to me.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.777
Your job right now

20:12.879 --> 20:16.047
is to do whatever you
can do to stay alive.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.149
Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.186
Now, put him on the phone.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.790
- She wants to talk to you.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.927
- I don't know who you
are or what you want,

20:30.029 --> 20:34.799
but you better be ready,
because I'm coming for my girl.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.770
Do you hear me?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.407
- Please.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.876
Please, just let me go
now, I won't say anything.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.845
Please.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.947
No.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.400
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.901
Come on, pick up.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.341
Pick up.
- You've reached Brent Gould.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.877
Leave a message.
- Oh.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.213
Brent, you need to call me
back as soon as you get this.

21:37.196 --> 21:37.895
The car.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.485
Cheryl?

22:01.587 --> 22:04.121
Hi it's Alice Gould.
- Hi Alice, how are you?

22:04.223 --> 22:07.024
- Uh, great, how are you?
- I'm good.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.527
- Hey, I have a
favor to ask you.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.062
I know I shouldn't
be doing this,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.898
but there was a car parked in
my neighborhood last night,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.401
and I was just wondering if you
could run the plates for me?

22:17.503 --> 22:19.870
- No, I can't
do that.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.138
- Yeah, I know.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.640
I just don't want to
get the police involved

22:22.742 --> 22:25.876
in case it was just a
neighbor or something.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.445
I don't wanna seem paranoid.

22:30.416 --> 22:34.018
- Don't tell
anyone, but I'll do it.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.553
- Really?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.355
That would be fantastic.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.989
Thank you so much, thank you.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.991
I will send the
image right over.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.093
Okay.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.272
- Okay, this is so not like her.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.074
- It's really weird.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.109
I'm gonna call her.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.044
Okay.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.115
- You have
reached the voicemail box of--

23:04.217 --> 23:07.017
- Hey, I've texted you
like a thousand times.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.085
We've been waiting for you

23:08.187 --> 23:09.286
and school's about to start,

23:09.389 --> 23:10.688
but you're not here.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.924
Wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.529
Anyways, text me back,
I'm kinda worried.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.887
- Cheryl, thanks for
getting back to me so quick.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.455
Any hits?
- Yeah.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.491
I got a Steve Jenkins.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.793
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.763
- Absolutely positive?

23:52.865 --> 23:55.733
- Give me his address.
- 2928 Meadowlark Lane.

23:58.371 --> 23:59.470
- Okay.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.071
Thank you Cheryl, I owe you.

24:39.445 --> 24:41.011
Call Victoria.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.417
- Good morning, Alice.
- Hi, good.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.819
Okay good, you're in already.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.120
- Yep, I got here early.

24:50.223 --> 24:51.355
I had to take care
of a few things.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.656
What time will you be here?

24:52.758 --> 24:54.325
- That's actually
why I'm calling.

24:54.427 --> 24:55.993
I'm not gonna be in today.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.361
- Um, you have the meeting

24:57.463 --> 24:59.363
with the potential
new tenants today.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.398
You have to be here.
- Maddy's sick, so,

25:01.501 --> 25:03.234
I need you to
actually reschedule

25:03.336 --> 25:04.468
those meetings for me today.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.403
- No offense,
Alice, but she's 17.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.205
She can stay home by herself.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.341
- Don't tell me how
to raise my daughter.

25:10.443 --> 25:13.444
- I'm sorry, that
wasn't what I intended.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.647
I didn't realize
it was so serious.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.048
Do you want me to call Brent

25:18.150 --> 25:19.316
and get him out of that meeting?

25:19.418 --> 25:20.551
- No, no, I'll deal with Brent.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.852
I don't want to worry him.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.420
Just go ahead and
cancel my meetings,

25:23.523 --> 25:24.855
all of them, for the whole week.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.323
- For the week?
- Yeah.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.260
Yeah, Maddy's got something
and I need to be with her.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.561
- Okay, sure.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.096
I hope she feels better.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.414
- Who are you?

26:23.516 --> 26:25.349
Why are you doing this?

26:26.552 --> 26:28.352
I could scream.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.520
Someone will hear me.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.830
Okay fine, I won't.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.401
But my mom meant what she said.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.072
She's gonna find me.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.773
She was a hostage negotiator,

26:49.875 --> 26:51.475
so she knows how
to do these things.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.210
Ah!

30:14.413 --> 30:15.712
- Maddy?

30:15.815 --> 30:17.714
Maddy, are you in there?

30:17.817 --> 30:18.615
Maddy?

30:20.786 --> 30:24.221
Maddy, are you in there?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.088
Maddy?

30:26.325 --> 30:28.058
- Alice, what are you doing?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.660
- Where's my daughter?
- What?

30:29.762 --> 30:31.628
- Where is Maddy?

30:31.730 --> 30:32.996
Is she in there?
- What are you talking about?

30:33.098 --> 30:35.399
- I said is she in there?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.667
- Why would she be in my garage?

30:36.769 --> 30:39.203
- You took her last
night, didn't you?

30:39.305 --> 30:40.637
You kidnapped her.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.472
Tell me!
- Whoa, whoa.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.576
I didn't kidnap Maddy.

30:45.678 --> 30:46.710
- You're lying.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.679
Where is she?

30:48.781 --> 30:50.147
Open it.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.149
I said open it right now!
- Alright, alright, alright!

30:52.251 --> 30:53.050
Easy.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.288
- Maddy?

31:05.297 --> 31:06.730
Maddy?

31:06.832 --> 31:08.031
- See?

31:08.133 --> 31:10.267
She's not in here.
- I don't understand.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.036
I don't under ...

31:13.138 --> 31:14.137
Who took her?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.074
What's going on?

31:17.176 --> 31:18.141
Talk to me.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.949
What's going on?
- I don't understand.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.420
- Talk to me, talk to me.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.622
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

31:31.724 --> 31:33.557
come here, come here.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.627
Come here, it's
alright, it's alright.

31:44.637 --> 31:46.203
How long has she been gone?

31:46.305 --> 31:47.471
- I don't know.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.743
Since sometime last night.

31:52.845 --> 31:54.044
- And the kidnapper
didn't say what he wanted?

31:54.146 --> 31:54.945
- No.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.880
Maddy asked him and he just said

31:56.982 --> 31:58.215
don't call the police.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.618
- No money?
- No.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.920
You know what that means.

32:03.022 --> 32:03.854
- It's personal.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.325
- Why were you outside
my house last night?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.962
- I don't know, I was,

32:12.064 --> 32:13.897
you know, after I ran
into you yesterday,

32:13.999 --> 32:15.399
and you told me Brent
was out of town,

32:15.501 --> 32:16.900
I got a little worried.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.735
I knew you and Maddy
would be home alone.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.404
- Have you done that before?

32:20.506 --> 32:21.672
- Maybe once or twice.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.409
- Sounds stalkerish.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.611
- I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.745
I know Brent's business dealings

32:28.847 --> 32:30.347
haven't always been
on the up and up.

32:30.449 --> 32:34.184
- , Steve, he promised
me that that's all over with.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.585
- Yeah, right.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.022
Look, the cop in
me won't go away.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.924
What can I say?

32:41.026 --> 32:42.326
Once a cop, always a cop.

32:43.629 --> 32:44.695
Though not anymore.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.132
- I still feel
responsible for that.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.134
- Yeah well, you're not,

32:51.236 --> 32:54.538
but it's weird, you're in a
very similar situation now.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.340
- I just hope that it
turns out differently.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.675
- Hey, hey listen to me.

32:58.777 --> 33:02.546
This will turn out
differently, I promise you.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.815
- I don't even know
where to begin.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.450
I only negotiated the releases.

33:06.552 --> 33:07.851
Where do I even start?

33:07.953 --> 33:10.020
- Let's just break it
down one step at a time.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.321
Can you think of any reason

33:11.423 --> 33:13.457
someone would want to
hurt any one of you?

33:13.559 --> 33:15.492
- No.
- Is Brent in debt again?

33:15.594 --> 33:17.761
- No, I keep a close
watch on the books.

33:17.863 --> 33:18.662
- What about you?

33:19.798 --> 33:20.797
Have you been
contacted by anyone

33:20.899 --> 33:22.265
from your days with the police?

33:23.736 --> 33:25.502
How about Nick?
- No.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.938
- No emails, no letters?
- Nothing.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.209
- What about Maddy?
- Maddy?

33:32.311 --> 33:34.044
Maddy's just, she's a kid.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.912
Who would go after her?

33:36.015 --> 33:38.715
- Kids get mixed up in all
sorts of bad stuff these days.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.084
- Do you think it was
someone at the party?

33:41.186 --> 33:42.719
- Nah, this doesn't feel like

33:42.821 --> 33:44.721
within the capabilities
of a teenager.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.256
- I mean, I don't know.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.991
There could have been
older kids there.

33:48.093 --> 33:51.728
Plus, Nick was 23, barely
older than a teenager.

33:51.830 --> 33:52.896
- Whose party was it?

33:55.934 --> 33:56.933
- Nicole.

34:03.675 --> 34:08.678
- I have to go to the bathroom.

34:09.514 --> 34:14.251
I have to go to the bathroom.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.559
No, like I have to go, go.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.475
- Okay, now you know you have
to stop by the front office

34:38.577 --> 34:40.911
for a pass, Mrs. Gould.
- Absolutely.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.688
- Nicole!

34:52.791 --> 34:54.658
- Mrs. Gould, how's
Maddy feeling?

34:54.760 --> 34:55.826
Josh said that she was sick.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.160
- She's, really sick.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.662
- Yeah, she hasn't
even been texting.

34:58.764 --> 34:59.996
- She's sleeping right now,

35:00.099 --> 35:02.099
so she doesn't have
the energy for that.

35:02.201 --> 35:05.402
- Oh, well, tell her that
I hope she feels better.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.872
- Uh, do you mind.
- Can you give us a moment?

35:08.974 --> 35:09.673
Thank you.

35:11.677 --> 35:12.676
Thanks.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.947
- Nicole, Maddy told me

35:17.049 --> 35:18.949
that she was at your
party last night.

35:20.119 --> 35:20.851
- Uh-oh.

35:23.188 --> 35:23.954
Are you a cop?

35:24.890 --> 35:26.089
Who are you?

35:26.191 --> 35:27.624
I know that you used
to work in the police.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.226
- I'm not a cop, I'm a
friend of Mrs. Gould.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.393
- He's definitely not a cop.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.862
- Was she at the party?

35:31.964 --> 35:34.531
- I, I don't know, I didn't--

35:34.633 --> 35:35.765
- Nicole, cut the crap.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.601
Was she at the party?

35:39.571 --> 35:41.605
- Maddy left as soon as
everyone started drinking.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.440
Maddy doesn't drink.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.474
Please don't tell my parents.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.076
I'll get in so much trouble,

35:46.178 --> 35:48.111
and they promised to take
me to Paris for my birthday,

35:48.213 --> 35:49.746
and if they find out, then
they'll cancel the trip.

35:49.848 --> 35:50.981
- Nicole, honey, it's fine.

35:51.083 --> 35:52.282
I'm not here to
get you in trouble.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.784
I just need to know
who was at the party?

35:54.887 --> 35:56.253
- I don't know, just
some friends from school.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.787
I really don't wanna get any
of them in trouble either.

35:57.890 --> 36:00.924
- Did anyone else leave after
you guys started drinking?

36:01.026 --> 36:01.791
- Um,

36:03.328 --> 36:04.161
Hunter?

36:05.697 --> 36:09.599
Yeah, he yeah, he left like
pretty soon after Maddy left.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.768
His parents are really
strict too, no offense.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.004
- And, do you know
where we could find him?

36:15.541 --> 36:17.007
- He and his friends sometimes
hang out at a coffee shop

36:17.109 --> 36:19.075
around the corner after school.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.510
I see them here sometimes.
- Okay.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.445
I think I've seen that.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.417
Maddy's talked about him a few
times before.

36:49.107 --> 36:49.906
- Ow!

37:42.294 --> 37:43.493
- Mine.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.195
I think she wore
them to the party.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.097
And one came off when
he took her, apparently,

37:47.199 --> 37:48.965
because I found
it in the street.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.334
- Like Cinderella?

37:51.436 --> 37:52.736
- More like Rapunzel.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.172
- We're gonna find her.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.843
- I just, it's my fault, again.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.111
- What is?
- All of this,

38:01.213 --> 38:02.746
this whole thing.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.681
I am so overprotective of her,

38:04.783 --> 38:06.716
and I don't trust her to
make the right decisions,

38:06.818 --> 38:07.584
but she did.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.086
She made the right decision.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.923
She left the party when
they started drinking.

38:14.026 --> 38:15.859
- You got a great kid there.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.894
- Yeah, she's the best.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.630
I gotta take this.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.098
Brent!
- Babe, what's going on?

38:22.200 --> 38:23.400
- Where have you been?

38:23.502 --> 38:25.902
- Your message
sounded kinda urgent.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.304
- I have something very,

38:29.041 --> 38:30.974
very difficult to tell
you, sit down, please.

38:31.076 --> 38:35.545
- What, is, is Maddy okay?

38:35.647 --> 38:37.781
- She's alive.
- Are--

38:37.883 --> 38:40.417
- But, she's been kidnapped.
- What?

38:40.519 --> 38:43.320
- I know.
- Kidnapped, by who?

38:43.422 --> 38:46.489
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Did you call the police?

38:46.591 --> 38:48.892
- No, whoever took her
said not to call the police.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.093
- Of course he said
not to call them.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.728
- Brent, please!

38:51.830 --> 38:53.630
- What does he want, money?
- No, I don't think so.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.898
- What else could
be want, Alice?

38:55.000 --> 38:55.965
What did he say?

38:56.068 --> 38:57.334
He didn't say anything.!

38:57.436 --> 38:58.468
You know what, I'm
getting on a plane

38:58.570 --> 38:59.836
and I'm coming home right now.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.971
- Okay, have Victoria
book you a flight out.

39:02.074 --> 39:03.273
- What are you gonna be doing?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.774
- I'm trying to find her.
- How?

39:04.876 --> 39:06.409
Who's that?

39:06.511 --> 39:07.977
I thought you just said
you didn't call the police.

39:08.080 --> 39:08.978
- Steve is here with me.

39:09.081 --> 39:11.481
- Steve, nice.
- Hey, Brent.

39:11.583 --> 39:12.949
Listen, we're gonna
do everything we can

39:13.051 --> 39:14.417
to get her back, okay?

39:14.519 --> 39:15.952
- Yeah, I'm sure you told a
lot of people that, Steve.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.320
Didn't always work out the
way you planned it, did it?

39:17.422 --> 39:20.023
- You know what Brent, I'm
here to help, that's it.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.529
- Sorry about Brent.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.131
- Uh, he's under
emotional distress.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.933
It's quite a shock.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.001
Do you see this kid?

39:34.439 --> 39:36.005
- Yeah, I think that's him.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.375
- Order for Hunter?
- Thank you.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.143
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's him.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.044
Let's go.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.847
Hunter.
- Hey, hey,

39:43.949 --> 39:45.115
what are you doing?

39:45.217 --> 39:46.683
- I need to have a
couple words with you.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.719
It's alright.
- Terrible report card.

39:52.257 --> 39:53.523
- What are you're doing?

39:53.625 --> 39:54.491
- Just have
a couple questions.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.359
- Hey, your Maddy's mom, right?

39:56.461 --> 39:57.994
- That's
Maddy's mom, alright.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.129
And you're going to tell us

39:59.231 --> 40:00.363
what happened with
Maddy last night.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.564
- What do you mean
what happened with her?

40:01.666 --> 40:02.532
Nothing happened.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.167
- You left the party after her.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.803
- Did you follow her?
- No!

40:06.905 --> 40:07.904
- Where'd you
go after the party?

40:08.006 --> 40:09.305
- I just went home!

40:09.408 --> 40:11.207
- Why'd you leave
right after her, Hunter?

40:11.309 --> 40:13.243
- Dude, if my parents
caught me underage drinking,

40:13.345 --> 40:14.577
they'd kill me.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.212
It's gonna jeopardize
me getting into Harvard

40:16.314 --> 40:17.414
or so they say.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.915
- You followed her
last night, didn't you?

40:19.017 --> 40:22.185
Where is she?
- No, I did not, I don't know.

40:22.287 --> 40:23.920
Why would I even do that?

40:24.022 --> 40:25.889
- Oh, come on, Hunter.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.690
You know, she's a cute girl.

40:27.793 --> 40:31.060
And you, heh, you obviously
think a lot of yourself.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.595
- No, man, it's
not even like that.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.197
Plus, she's not even into me.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.999
She likes Josh.
- Josh?

40:36.101 --> 40:36.933
His name keeps coming up.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.902
Who's this Josh kid?

40:39.004 --> 40:41.070
- Kid, it's a teacher.
- Excuse me?

40:41.173 --> 40:41.938
- Mr. Hammer.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.108
Yeah.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.411
- Hey, man,
thanks for your time.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.947
Sorry to interrupt you.
- Yeah, alright.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.517
For sure.
- You have a good day.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.453
- You too.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.760
- I'm gonna kill him.
- What are you thinking?

41:23.815 --> 41:25.048
- Hi.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.083
- Don't act
so excited to hear me.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.118
- I have a lot on
my mind right now.

41:29.221 --> 41:30.420
- Yeah, I know.

41:30.522 --> 41:33.122
That conversation we had
was really unpleasant.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.791
- No, no it's other things.

41:34.893 --> 41:35.992
- What is it, Brent?

41:36.094 --> 41:37.160
You seem upset.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.495
- No, I can't, alright?

41:38.597 --> 41:40.730
There's some stuff going
on with Maddy and Alice.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.834
- Babe, you can tell me,
that's what I'm here for.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.002
- Yeah, I can't get into
this with you right now.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.570
Did you book my ticket?

41:47.672 --> 41:50.907
- Yeah, I was just forwarding
you the information now.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.643
A car will be there in
15 minutes to pick you up

41:53.745 --> 41:55.144
and take you to the airport,

41:55.247 --> 41:57.981
and you should be
back in town by 10:00.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.782
- Thank you.
- Brent,

41:59.885 --> 42:02.085
come and see me
when you get back.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.954
I'll help you cope with
whatever is going on at home

42:05.056 --> 42:06.623
and we can work
out our problems.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.025
- No, I just need to
be with my family.

42:09.127 --> 42:10.326
- Brent--

42:10.428 --> 42:12.028
- Victoria, I'll
talk to you later.

42:16.234 --> 42:16.933
- Ugh!

42:21.573 --> 42:23.039
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

42:24.209 --> 42:25.708
I grabbed it before I left.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.644
I don't even know why I did it.

42:27.746 --> 42:31.047
- Good instincts, do
you know her password?

42:31.149 --> 42:32.081
- I can guess.

42:34.619 --> 42:36.185
- Angiovanni?

42:36.288 --> 42:39.022
- The sparkly shoes, she's
obsessed with that brand.

42:39.124 --> 42:40.523
- Alright, let's look
at her search history.

42:40.625 --> 42:41.457
- Okay.

42:42.627 --> 42:46.162
Hemingway, Fitzgerald--
- Pretty smart kid.

42:46.264 --> 42:49.666
- How to sneak out without
your mom finding out.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.200
- And there's the teenager.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.736
Here's something.

42:53.838 --> 42:57.140
- How to tell if an older
guy likes you, oh my God.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.241
At least we know we're
on the right track.

42:58.343 --> 42:59.842
- Any addresses?

42:59.945 --> 43:01.978
Maybe she was trying to
find out where he lives.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.248
- No, let's check her emails.
- Okay.

43:07.819 --> 43:08.818
- Okay, open up.

43:09.754 --> 43:10.486
Hammer.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.023
Oh no.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.259
He's sending her poems.

43:19.130 --> 43:22.298
Your hair is like a gleaming
chestnut in the sun.

43:23.201 --> 43:24.567
She's 17.

43:25.503 --> 43:26.703
I'm gonna to kill him.

43:26.805 --> 43:28.304
- What does the
latest email say?

43:29.307 --> 43:31.240
- Okay, here's one
from three days ago.

43:32.877 --> 43:35.278
Can't wait to talk in person.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.246
Let's meet in my office.

43:37.349 --> 43:40.049
Best not to tell
your mom for now.

43:40.151 --> 43:41.517
- What a creep.

43:41.620 --> 43:44.020
- Would he really keep
her at the school?

43:44.122 --> 43:45.254
- Well, let's go find out.

43:48.426 --> 43:49.592
- Come on, man.

43:49.694 --> 43:51.794
- Nick, we're gonna
talk about this.

43:51.896 --> 43:53.296
- I'm gonna kill her.

43:53.398 --> 43:56.132
- Nick, calm down.
- Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,

43:56.234 --> 43:57.266
you've got nowhere to go!

43:57.369 --> 43:58.401
Easy, easy.

43:59.537 --> 44:00.336
Come on, think about this!

44:00.438 --> 44:02.038
Think about this, don't do it!

44:02.140 --> 44:02.939
- Nick.

44:05.243 --> 44:06.643
Nick, come on, please.
- No, no, no.

44:06.745 --> 44:09.412
- Come on, okay.

44:13.752 --> 44:14.651
Put the knife down.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.020
- I can't, I love her.

44:17.122 --> 44:18.988
- Is this how people
show love, Nick?

44:20.225 --> 44:23.159
By abducting them and
holding them at knifepoint?

44:23.261 --> 44:25.161
- Don't come any closer!
- Hey, okay.

44:25.263 --> 44:26.829
- Don't do it, man, come on.

44:26.931 --> 44:30.166
We just wanna return Lily safely
to her parents, that's it.

44:30.268 --> 44:30.967
- Why?

44:31.069 --> 44:32.001
They don't love her.

44:32.103 --> 44:33.302
They wouldn't even
let her see me!

44:33.405 --> 44:35.038
They kept answering
the phone for her,

44:35.140 --> 44:36.606
telling her not to see me!

44:36.708 --> 44:37.840
- Everything is gonna be okay.

44:37.942 --> 44:39.275
- It's all lies!

44:39.377 --> 44:41.544
- Nick, don't man, think
about this, think about it.

44:41.646 --> 44:44.180
- Nick, we'll talk
to her parents.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.849
We'll let them know.
- Why should I believe you?

44:46.951 --> 44:49.385
- We'll tell them that you
need to be able to see her.

44:49.487 --> 44:51.521
Just put the knife down, Nick.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.692
- Lily, will you tell them
that you wanna be with me?

44:55.794 --> 44:57.660
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:57.762 --> 44:59.495
- Nick, putting
my gun away, okay?

44:59.597 --> 45:02.532
Gun's going away,
stay calm, stay calm.

45:02.634 --> 45:05.668
- I wanna be with
you, I love you.

45:07.439 --> 45:09.005
- You don't wanna do this.

45:09.107 --> 45:09.872
- I swear.

45:11.176 --> 45:12.208
- Don't do it, don't do it.

45:12.310 --> 45:13.342
- I don't believe you.
- It's true!

45:13.445 --> 45:15.411
- Liar!
- No, no, no, no!

45:24.856 --> 45:27.090
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I think.

45:27.192 --> 45:29.225
I just drifted off
there for a second.

45:29.327 --> 45:30.827
- All the doors are locked.

45:30.929 --> 45:32.228
There's cameras everywhere.

45:32.330 --> 45:33.996
I don't think we're gonna
have any luck breaking in.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.331
- So, what do you
think we should we do,

45:35.433 --> 45:37.166
just sit out here all
night, 'til he comes out?

45:37.268 --> 45:39.202
- Well, it's
getting pretty late.

45:39.304 --> 45:40.937
Are you sure that's
his car over there?

45:41.039 --> 45:43.106
- Yeah, I mean it's the
description that Nicole gave us,

45:43.208 --> 45:44.373
and he wasn't at his house.

45:44.476 --> 45:45.208
He's gotta be here.

45:45.310 --> 45:46.509
- Who's there?
- Ow!

45:46.611 --> 45:50.113
- Oh, you again.
- Can I help you?

45:50.215 --> 45:51.414
- Help me?

45:51.516 --> 45:53.049
You're the ones trespassing
on school grounds.

45:53.151 --> 45:54.951
- My daughter goes
to school here.

45:55.053 --> 45:57.019
- Yes, I know, Mrs. Gould.

45:57.122 --> 45:58.221
That doesn't give you the right

45:58.323 --> 45:59.388
to be on school
property after hours.

45:59.491 --> 46:00.957
- Who's this again?
- The traffic attendant.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.358
- I do security here.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.460
I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

46:04.562 --> 46:06.696
- What is your name, again?

46:06.798 --> 46:08.097
- Marilyn.
- Marilyn.

46:08.199 --> 46:09.799
Marilyn, can we ask
you for a huge favor?

46:09.901 --> 46:11.367
Mrs. Gould's daughter
is very sick,

46:11.469 --> 46:12.602
and we need to get
into her locker

46:12.704 --> 46:14.270
to get her college applications

46:14.372 --> 46:16.439
so she doesn't miss
the filing deadline,

46:16.541 --> 46:17.440
and do you think there's any way

46:17.542 --> 46:19.542
you could help us out with that?

46:19.644 --> 46:20.443
- Please.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.552
- That was very smooth.

46:29.654 --> 46:30.787
You had her eating
out of your hands.

46:30.889 --> 46:33.055
- Yeah, I have that
effect on women.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.390
- Some, maybe.

46:37.395 --> 46:39.962
Alright, I think his office
is right around here.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.975
A struggle you think?

46:53.077 --> 46:54.477
- Yeah, maybe,

46:54.579 --> 46:57.313
It looks like he just freaked
out and tossed the place.

46:59.784 --> 47:01.050
- Well, it's obvious
he isn't keeping her here.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.019
Look at this.

47:06.257 --> 47:07.890
- That might explain something.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.258
- Motive for despair?

47:14.032 --> 47:19.035
I think I know.

47:22.373 --> 47:23.840
- You know
about this place.

47:23.942 --> 47:25.508
- I helped Maddy
bring chairs down here

47:25.610 --> 47:27.109
after one of her readings.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.311
- You really think
he's holed up here.

47:28.413 --> 47:29.445
He could be anywhere
in the school.

47:29.547 --> 47:31.147
- Yeah, this is
definitely the place.

47:31.249 --> 47:32.315
He keeps all of his
equipment in there,

47:32.417 --> 47:34.283
lights, microphones, podium.

47:37.455 --> 47:38.788
- It was his fault, not yours.

47:40.792 --> 47:42.024
- What are you talking about?

47:42.126 --> 47:43.292
- You said you felt bad
about ending my career.

47:43.394 --> 47:44.994
You didn't, Nick did.

47:45.096 --> 47:46.362
- I pulled the trigger.

47:47.298 --> 47:48.998
I shouldn't have, I
was never a great shot.

47:49.100 --> 47:51.067
- He made the first
move towards violence.

47:51.169 --> 47:52.368
We did what we
were trained to do.

47:52.470 --> 47:55.304
- No, I should have gone
for her, not the gun.

47:55.406 --> 47:57.406
- Your bullet only grazed
her leg, it didn't kill her.

47:57.508 --> 47:59.408
The knife did, okay?

48:00.778 --> 48:03.012
- No, not gonna
happen this time.

48:03.114 --> 48:08.117
- No, it's not.

48:09.087 --> 48:12.421
- Where is she?
- Where is she?

48:12.523 --> 48:13.556
- Who are you?

48:13.658 --> 48:14.657
Mrs. Gould?
- Where is she?

48:14.759 --> 48:15.992
Where is Maddy?

48:16.094 --> 48:18.227
- She's at home, she
was sick, I thought.

48:18.329 --> 48:20.196
- Do you flirt with all
the 17 year old girls

48:20.298 --> 48:21.597
or just Maddy?

48:21.699 --> 48:23.199
- What is he talking about?
- Come on, cut the crap!

48:23.301 --> 48:26.102
I saw the emails that you
sent her, romantic poems!

48:26.204 --> 48:27.937
She's 17, you creep!

48:28.039 --> 48:29.939
- That was from
our critique group.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.407
You've been to the readings.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.609
She was in the process of
submitting something to Ainsley,

48:33.711 --> 48:35.177
which you didn't approve of.

48:36.481 --> 48:39.682
They were her poems,
I just critiqued them.

48:41.986 --> 48:43.352
Look, I'm sorry, but,

48:45.490 --> 48:47.189
she's got a lot of
passion and talent,

48:47.292 --> 48:48.557
and I'm not gonna
let you stifle that.

48:48.660 --> 48:51.627
- He's lying, trying to
throw us off the scent.

48:51.729 --> 48:53.462
You're too close to these kids.

48:53.564 --> 48:55.264
Josh this, Josh that.

48:55.366 --> 48:57.366
- I learned from
my mistake today.

48:57.468 --> 48:59.568
Moving forth, they're gonna
start calling me Mr. Hammer.

48:59.671 --> 49:02.438
- Oh god, he's
telling the truth.

49:03.808 --> 49:05.675
- Did you go in my office?
- We did.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.845
- So you saw it, the
rejection letter.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.549
- Alright, Josh.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.751
Alright, you're young enough.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.386
You'll write a book one
day worth publishing.

49:17.488 --> 49:18.387
Let's get him outta here.

49:18.489 --> 49:19.956
- Mrs. Gould.
- Watch your step.

49:20.058 --> 49:22.158
- I'm really sorry about
what I said to you earlier.

49:22.260 --> 49:24.293
- Easy, easy.
- I really think you're ...

49:24.395 --> 49:26.429
- Take it easy, Josh, and
stay off those kids, okay?

49:26.531 --> 49:27.396
- Thanks, Steve.
- Young girls?

49:27.498 --> 49:28.731
- Hey, Steve ...

49:30.902 --> 49:32.468
- Yeah,
man, you got him?

49:32.570 --> 49:35.805
- Hey, Tony, I'm sorry, but
we've had a bit of an emergency.

49:35.907 --> 49:37.440
Brent had to fly back
to be with our daughter

49:37.542 --> 49:38.574
who's very sick.

49:40.411 --> 49:43.412
Yes, he will reschedule
when she's feeling better.

49:43.514 --> 49:44.547
I am sure.

49:46.050 --> 49:48.084
No, we are not going with
another construction company.

49:48.186 --> 49:49.652
I promise.

49:49.754 --> 49:51.287
Okay, Tony, I gotta go.

49:51.389 --> 49:53.022
We will be in touch, okay?

49:53.124 --> 49:54.423
Yep, I promise, okay.

49:55.393 --> 49:57.259
Sheez!
- Who's that?

49:57.362 --> 49:59.128
- Tony, the owner of
the construction company

49:59.230 --> 50:01.263
that Brent was supposed
to meet with in New York.

50:01.366 --> 50:02.365
He keeps texting me about this,

50:02.467 --> 50:03.699
thinking we're replacing him.

50:03.801 --> 50:05.368
It's starting to
get on my nerves.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.838
- Should we look at
Maddy's email again?

50:08.940 --> 50:09.739
- No.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.676
I think we've exhausted everyone
in her life at this point.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.549
It might be time to visit Nick.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.456
- Who would you though?

50:27.558 --> 50:30.559
- Nick, put them through.

50:55.286 --> 50:56.419
- I didn't believe them

50:56.521 --> 50:57.453
when they told me who
was here to see me.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.954
- It's been a while, Nick.

51:00.892 --> 51:04.126
- Well, time flies when you
have nothing left to live for.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.161
- You did that to yourself.

51:05.263 --> 51:07.029
- No, I did not.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.197
You did this to me,

51:09.100 --> 51:10.266
and you,

51:10.368 --> 51:11.233
but mostly you.

51:12.770 --> 51:16.372
Well anyway, I've enjoyed
this jaunt down memory lane,

51:16.474 --> 51:18.374
but I'm in for life
and time's a-wasting,

51:18.476 --> 51:20.342
so unless you have anything
else you'd like to say,

51:20.445 --> 51:21.610
I think I'll be going.

51:23.114 --> 51:25.347
- Sit back down, we're
not finished with you yet.

51:28.886 --> 51:29.585
- Okay.

51:30.721 --> 51:31.487
Alright.

51:33.658 --> 51:35.558
Well, enough of the niceties.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.326
Let's get down to
why you're both here.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.728
- We find ourselves in
a very similar situation

51:39.831 --> 51:41.197
that we were in three years ago.

51:41.299 --> 51:42.531
- Someone ran away
from their parents

51:42.633 --> 51:44.133
to be with the man she loves?

51:44.235 --> 51:47.236
- Nick, we know that's
not what happened.

51:47.338 --> 51:48.604
- So, what do you want from me?

51:49.941 --> 51:52.374
- Wanted to get some
insight from you.

51:52.477 --> 51:55.544
See what it's like to be
inside the head of a kidnapper.

51:55.646 --> 51:58.747
- Well, Alice, I can
call you Alice, right?

51:59.984 --> 52:02.184
You'd know better than
me for two reasons.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.653
First of all, you're
the professional.

52:04.755 --> 52:06.255
Second of all, and I
don't know how many times

52:06.357 --> 52:09.024
I need to tell you this,
but I did not kidnap Lily.

52:09.127 --> 52:10.226
She ran away to be with me.

52:10.328 --> 52:11.494
- I don't care
about your opinions.

52:11.596 --> 52:13.929
Just wanna know why you did it.

52:14.031 --> 52:16.098
- Well, love of course.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.000
- You didn't love her,
you didn't even know her.

52:18.102 --> 52:19.502
- Of course I knew her.

52:19.604 --> 52:21.103
She was my girlfriend.

52:21.205 --> 52:23.572
We were getting married,
have kids, a family,

52:23.674 --> 52:25.274
and you two messed it up.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.576
Ruined my life,
thank you for that.

52:27.678 --> 52:29.845
- She was a girl who
worked in a coffee shop

52:29.947 --> 52:33.282
that you became obsessed
with and you stalked her,

52:33.384 --> 52:34.950
like you did to many
other young women,

52:35.052 --> 52:35.918
we came to discover.

52:36.020 --> 52:37.686
- Our relationship was special.

52:37.788 --> 52:39.421
- We've heard you have
a pretty keen interest

52:39.524 --> 52:41.123
in keeping up with
who's in and who's out,

52:41.225 --> 52:44.126
and have plenty of phone
calls with the outside.

52:44.228 --> 52:45.895
- Well, that isn't
a crime, is it?

52:45.997 --> 52:47.129
- No, certainly not.

52:48.399 --> 52:50.032
But if you asked any
of your little buddies

52:50.134 --> 52:51.400
you made in prison
to do anything,

52:51.502 --> 52:56.105
say, kidnap another
little 17 year old girl,

52:56.207 --> 52:58.841
now, that would be a crime.

53:00.811 --> 53:03.279
- Are you accusing me
of conspiring to kidnap

53:03.381 --> 53:05.014
a sweet innocent little girl?

53:09.353 --> 53:10.619
I want my lawyer.

53:10.721 --> 53:11.921
- You're not entitled to one.

53:12.023 --> 53:14.623
- Uh, yes I am,
I know my rights.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.058
- We're not working
for the police

53:16.160 --> 53:18.427
and this isn't an interrogation.

53:18.529 --> 53:22.064
This is just us coming
in here as civilians

53:22.166 --> 53:24.066
having a friendly conversation.

53:24.168 --> 53:26.602
- Oh, this is so friendly,

53:26.704 --> 53:29.471
accusing me of conspiring to
kidnap a sweet, innocent girl.

53:29.574 --> 53:32.141
That's exactly what friends do.

53:32.243 --> 53:33.409
- Are you involved?

53:34.512 --> 53:36.345
- What if I am?
- Are you?

53:38.716 --> 53:39.615
- Answer the damn question

53:39.717 --> 53:41.116
or I will kill you right now.

53:41.219 --> 53:43.118
- No, I'm not.

53:43.221 --> 53:45.988
- You haven't asked
anyone to kidnap someone?

53:46.090 --> 53:47.756
Hinted they might do it?

53:47.858 --> 53:50.025
Told them how you abducted Lily?

53:50.127 --> 53:51.460
- What would I get out of it?

53:51.562 --> 53:53.362
I'm stuck in here
for life, remember?

53:55.399 --> 53:56.532
Oh.

53:56.634 --> 53:59.101
You think I did
it out of revenge.

53:59.203 --> 53:59.935
Who's is it?

54:03.241 --> 54:04.506
You had a kid, didn't you?

54:04.609 --> 54:06.775
- She's 17, just like Lily.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.644
- Someone has abducted her.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.212
- What do they want?

54:10.314 --> 54:11.680
- I don't know.

54:11.782 --> 54:12.881
- There's no money involved?

54:12.984 --> 54:13.983
- No.

54:14.085 --> 54:15.217
- Sounds very personal.

54:16.721 --> 54:17.853
Let me assure you

54:17.955 --> 54:20.189
that I am absolutely
no way involved.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.492
But I am absolutely thrilled
that this is happening.

54:27.632 --> 54:30.466
Well, y'all have
a nice life now.

54:30.568 --> 54:33.902
Oh, and tell your daughter,
if you ever see her again,

54:34.972 --> 54:35.738
come by and say hi.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.239
I'd love to meet her.

54:42.179 --> 54:43.379
- Enjoy your time here.

54:45.449 --> 54:47.049
- Have a nice life in prison.

55:04.368 --> 55:05.134
- No.

55:08.973 --> 55:12.274
It would be a lot easier to
eat if I could use my hands.

55:48.346 --> 55:49.078
- Ow!

55:59.857 --> 56:02.591
- Oh stop, no, no!

56:02.693 --> 56:03.659
What do you think?

56:03.761 --> 56:05.094
- It's definitely not him.

56:06.130 --> 56:08.931
- Ugh, back to square one?

56:09.934 --> 56:11.333
- Steve, I don't understand.

56:11.435 --> 56:12.935
It's obviously personal,

56:13.037 --> 56:14.503
but we've gone through
everyone in her life,

56:14.605 --> 56:16.038
and it's not any one of them.

56:16.140 --> 56:19.074
And even Nick, he was a
long shot, but it's not him.

56:21.078 --> 56:23.779
- There's only one person left
in the family to check out.

56:23.881 --> 56:24.613
- Sorry.

56:26.751 --> 56:27.549
- Anything?

56:29.086 --> 56:30.452
- No, it's just this Tony guy,

56:30.554 --> 56:32.988
wondering when Brent is
gonna reschedule the meeting.

56:33.090 --> 56:34.156
It's almost midnight there.

56:34.258 --> 56:36.225
Why is this guy so desperate?

56:36.327 --> 56:38.160
- How well do you know this guy?

56:38.262 --> 56:39.461
- Not very well.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.697
Our assistant, she
made the introduction

56:41.799 --> 56:42.898
between Tony and Brent,

56:43.000 --> 56:44.800
but I didn't have
anything to do with it.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.002
- Sounds fishy.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.138
- No, Brent wouldn't go there.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.239
- But he did.

56:51.909 --> 56:53.342
- Steve, no.

56:53.444 --> 56:54.843
- I think it's
time we take a look

56:54.945 --> 56:56.578
into Brent's
financial activities.

57:08.125 --> 57:09.158
- You've
reached Brent Gould.

57:09.260 --> 57:10.159
Leave me a message.

57:10.261 --> 57:11.493
- I don't want this over.

57:14.098 --> 57:15.731
I know you've been
distant lately,

57:15.833 --> 57:17.666
but I love you so much.

57:17.768 --> 57:20.369
And you said that you
would leave Alice,

57:20.471 --> 57:23.138
and she's still
your wife, not me!

57:27.244 --> 57:28.277
Brent,

57:31.749 --> 57:35.184
you are going have to hold
up your end of the bargain,

57:37.154 --> 57:41.156
or there's no
telling what I'll do.

57:52.169 --> 57:53.235
- I don't understand

57:53.337 --> 57:54.570
why he doesn't keep this
stuff at the office.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.238
- He's paranoid
about our employees

57:56.340 --> 57:58.941
having access to too
much information.

57:59.043 --> 58:00.609
- It seems like
access to information

58:00.711 --> 58:02.945
is necessary to run a business.

58:03.047 --> 58:05.347
- When your own employee
turns you in to the FBI,

58:06.584 --> 58:09.284
you're gonna take a
few more precautions.

58:09.386 --> 58:10.619
- If you're not
doing anything wrong,

58:10.721 --> 58:12.721
you got nothing to hide.

58:12.823 --> 58:15.057
- Spoken like a true cop.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.093
And he was never charged.

58:18.195 --> 58:20.162
- Doesn't mean he didn't do it.

58:20.264 --> 58:23.165
- Look, he hid some
things from me,

58:23.267 --> 58:25.067
and he got involved
with the wrong people,

58:25.169 --> 58:29.071
but I don't think he set
out to do anything wrong.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.639
- Okay.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.474
- Steve, there's no way.

58:32.576 --> 58:33.909
- Wait.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.677
What are these deposits from?

58:35.779 --> 58:37.412
- It's payments from
apartment buildings

58:37.515 --> 58:39.081
we manage in New York.

58:39.183 --> 58:41.083
- I thought you guys
just developed property.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.150
- I convinced Brent
that we needed

58:42.253 --> 58:43.752
more dependable
streams of income

58:43.854 --> 58:46.288
in case our development
deals failed.

58:46.390 --> 58:48.423
- Okay, very practical.

58:48.526 --> 58:49.791
Looks like a good decision too.

58:49.894 --> 58:51.260
You're just breaking
even at the moment.

58:51.362 --> 58:52.528
- That'll change once
we get the funding

58:52.630 --> 58:53.996
for the new building.

58:54.098 --> 58:56.798
- And who's handling that?
- Brent.

58:56.901 --> 58:59.201
He'd prefer I deal with all
the property management,

58:59.303 --> 59:00.636
since it was all my idea.

59:00.738 --> 59:03.171
- Why is he trying to cut
you out of everything?

59:03.274 --> 59:04.373
It sounds like he
doesn't trust you,

59:04.475 --> 59:06.608
or he's hiding something.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.043
- No, he,

59:08.145 --> 59:09.144
he trusts me.

59:09.246 --> 59:10.612
I have access to everything.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.047
Here look.

59:13.317 --> 59:15.250
Here's our agreement
with the investor.

59:17.221 --> 59:18.820
- That seems like an
awfully large percentage

59:18.923 --> 59:21.223
this investor gets when the
building produces profit.

59:21.325 --> 59:23.358
- No, it's just the standard.

59:25.229 --> 59:25.928
See?

59:27.398 --> 59:28.430
Whoa.

59:30.334 --> 59:33.168
Wait, somebody changed
this after I saw it.

59:33.270 --> 59:35.370
This is not what we agreed on.

59:35.472 --> 59:36.872
- Who's this company again?

59:38.509 --> 59:40.309
- M & G Holdings.
- M & G Holdings.

59:40.411 --> 59:42.044
- I don't know much about them.

59:43.414 --> 59:45.247
There's not that much on the
internet about them, either.

59:45.349 --> 59:47.349
They don't even have a website.

59:47.451 --> 59:49.785
- See if there's any owners
of the company listed.

59:52.990 --> 59:54.823
- No, nothing.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.959
Just a P.O. Box in Delaware.

59:58.429 --> 59:59.695
It's not unusual.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:04.833
- You know what?

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.702
My partner joined the
FBI when I retired.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.770
Why don't I call her and
see if she knows anything?

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:12.240
- Okay, but just don't
say anything about Maddy.

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:13.375
- No, of course not.

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:18.313
- Who changed this?

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.451
- Yeah, Dana Cohen?

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:27.255
Steve, she knows who it is.

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:28.757
Yeah have her call me back.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:30.492
Okay, thanks.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.262
She's gonna call me back.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.399
I don't know what
to tell you, Alice.

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:07.129
Thanks Dana, yeah sorry
for calling so late.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:08.397
Say hi to Dan and the kids.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.632
Yep.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:13.235
- Well?
- It's not good.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:14.136
- Just tell me.

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:15.437
It could be linked to Maddy.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:16.905
- The feds have been
looking at M & G Holdings

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.273
for a while now.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.108
- So, they survey
a lot of companies.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.310
- There's all sorts of
nefarious activities,

01:01:22.413 --> 01:01:25.414
Loan sharking,
drugs, trafficking.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.449
- Trafficking?

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:31.253
- With ties to the
mafia, run by ...

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:34.322
- Tony Materelli?
- Mmhmm.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.863
Do you think Brent knew?

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:43.699
- I don't know how
he couldn't have.

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:45.967
Dana says they're
investigating Brent as well,

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.537
and she thinks he's been
laundering money for them.

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:51.373
- No, I don't believe it.

01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:52.474
- She has
surveillance photos

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:54.109
she's gonna email me.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:57.345
- No, no he promised me that
he wouldn't do this again,

01:01:57.448 --> 01:02:01.016
that he wouldn't get involved
with people like this again.

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:02.384
- He broke that promise, Alice.

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:04.853
- If he lied to me again,
I am gonna kill him.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.488
- Listen, listen to me.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.356
You need to just chill
out for a minute,

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:10.759
and take a breath and
get some food into you.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.361
- Get some food?

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.033
I need to find her.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.536
I'm sorry, I ...

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:26.475
- It's okay, it's
alright, it's alright.

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:27.309
- Okay.

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:29.311
Okay.

01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:31.880
- Come on.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:32.781
Come on.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.520
- This is
good, thank you.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.457
- You keep very nice
ingredients in your house.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:18.560
- They have very expensive
grocery stores in Beverly Hills.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:19.661
- Yeah, apparently.

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:22.164
- I wonder if she's hungry.

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:26.401
It's been almost 24 hours.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:32.440
- Hey, we'll get her
whatever she wants to eat

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:33.875
when we find her, alright?

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.644
- Thank you, uh--
- Sorry.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.583
I've really missed you.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.586
We became pretty close
during Lily's case.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:49.658
Did Brent ask you to
cut off contact with me?

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:53.395
- He did.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.396
- Yeah, I figured.

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:58.099
He always seemed to try
and control you too much.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.502
- Sometimes he
disregards my feelings,

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:01.736
but he's not controlling.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:05.106
- But you stopped
returning my calls.

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:06.308
- Yeah, not 'cause
he asked me too,

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.543
but because I knew
we were getting ...

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:16.952
Look, I would be risking
my family and my marriage

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:21.456
if I was to stay in
contact with you.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:25.493
- That's very noble of you.

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:27.829
- I'm sorry if I
hurt your feelings.

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:30.198
- No, no listen,
it's understandable,

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.100
especially now that
I know the reason.

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:36.638
Probably Dana.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.739
- What did she say?

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:40.742
- Do you know when
these were taken?

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:44.846
- Yeah, Victoria and
Brent went to meet

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.048
with the investment
company last month.

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:53.555
What?

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.726
- Alice, it's ...

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:14.643
- So he's a liar and a cheater.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:20.448
Dammit!

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.366
I can't believe this ...

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:42.470
He's cheated on me
with our assistant

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:48.543
who introduced him to this
man with mafia connections,

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:50.612
who probably
abducted our daughter

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:52.614
in order to force Brent to
go through with the deal

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:56.284
or to sell her to
some sex trafficker.

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:57.719
- Do you know where he is now?

01:05:58.889 --> 01:06:00.622
- His should have landed by now.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.826
I'll tell him to meet
us at the office.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.294
- Yeah.

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:07.195
Let's go.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:18.406
- Ah!

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:20.442
I don't care if you kill me.

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:21.710
I am not going
back in that room!

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.215
It's you!

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:31.686
- What are
we looking for?

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:32.821
- Anything having to do
with Tony's companies,

01:06:32.923 --> 01:06:34.489
a receipt, an invoice,

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.858
something that has an
address on the West Coast.

01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:40.462
- Are you gonna make
him sleep in the office?

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:41.663
- He's done it plenty
of times before

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.565
when he's pulled all-nighters.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.900
Oh god, that's why
he didn't come home.

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:51.539
- Any idea where she is?

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:55.343
What the hell, Alice?

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:56.778
- This is all your fault.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.547
You did this, with you and
your little girlfriend.

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:01.850
- What the hell are
you talking about?

01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:03.351
- Stop,.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:06.521
I, I have seen photos
of you kissing Victoria

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:08.790
outside of Tony's office.

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:10.625
- Where did you
see these photos?

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.629
- Steve has a
contact at the FBI.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.699
Turns out, Tony owns both
the construction company

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.534
and the investment company,

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.302
but you knew that, didn't you?

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:23.371
- We are in debt, Alice.

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:25.707
In order to make this
project work and get us out,

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.008
I had to make a lot of money.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.577
- We're not in that much debt.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:30.879
I keep track of the books.

01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:33.248
I know exactly how much
money goes in and out.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.649
- No, you don't.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.251
I had to borrow a lot of money,

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.520
and open up credit cards
that you don't know about.

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:39.921
- Why?

01:07:40.023 --> 01:07:42.323
- To keep us afloat,
to build the business,

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:43.758
to provide for our family.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.495
- How bad is it?
- Bad.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.164
- We could have just
declared bankruptcy.

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:52.667
- No, I was not gonna
fail for a second time.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.169
We're gonna finish building
this condo building,

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:55.737
and it's gonna be a success.

01:07:55.839 --> 01:08:00.842
- Yeah, with dirty money.

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:02.744
- You didn't think I
tried to find funding

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.245
from any other source?

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.581
No one would touch me, Alice.

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:08.883
I got a failed project,
debt up to my eyeballs.

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:10.185
Tony was the only person

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:11.586
that was gonna
lend me any money.

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.354
- People like Tony
prey upon people

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.223
in a situation like yours,

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:16.524
and by associating with him,

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.393
you put your daughter in danger.

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.428
- There's Steve, lurking
in the shadows huh?

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.296
I'm sure you're
loving this, man,

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.466
just waiting to step in here,
make me look like the bad guy

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:25.399
so you could save Alice.

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:26.533
- I don't need saving.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.604
- Steve has been present

01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:32.372
in our relationship
for a long time.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.777
- Brent, Alice and I
were only ever friends.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:36.978
Alright?

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.212
- But, you have
feelings for my wife.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.281
- Brent!
- No, I wanna hear him say it.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.952
Do you have feelings
for my wife, Steve?

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:45.819
Well, there it is.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.290
At least now it's out in the
open after all this time.

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:52.292
- , none of this
is important right now!

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:54.729
Our daughter has been kidnapped,

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:56.731
and Tony's cronies
probably abducted her

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:59.734
in order to force you to
go through with the deal.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:02.069
- Brent, is there any place
they would have taken her?

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.772
A West Coast office or
warehouse, anything, man.

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:07.242
- No, I don't know any of
Tony's contacts out here.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:10.178
I think it's probably time
we reached out to the police.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.645
- We are not calling the police.

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.648
- Alice, it's been 24 hours.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.617
We don't have the
skills or the resources

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:17.652
to deal with Tony's people.

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.921
Alright, desipte Steve of
there playing cops and robbers.

01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:22.290
- Whoever took her said
not to call the police,

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:24.859
and I am no letting what
happened to Lily happen to her.

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:28.196
- At some point, someone is
gonna realize she is gone.

01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:29.663
How are we going to explain it?

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.765
- Alice called the school
and told them she was sick.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:33.100
- I forgot to call them.

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:37.205
- But, Josh said the secretary
told him she was sick.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.506
- No, I didn't call them.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:40.575
- And, her friend
knew she was sick too.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.479
- Why would you do this?

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.314
- Two reasons, really.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.651
First, to test your
father's loyalty to me.

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:51.618
- His loyalty to you,

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.953
but, you're the one
who works for him.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:56.391
- His loyalty to me
personally, not professionally.

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:58.293
- I don't understand.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:00.828
- I needed to see
who he would run to

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.297
if something went wrong.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.166
You see, your father and I
have been having an affair

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:07.335
for over two years.

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:08.770
- I don't believe you.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.573
My dad would never
cheat on my mom.

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:12.840
- He promised me

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:14.609
he was gonna leave
your mother for me,

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.612
and that we would continue to
build this business together.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:20.582
- He loves my mom and
would never leave her.

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:27.722
- But lately, he's been
distant, canceling dates,

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:31.426
and spending more
time with your mother,

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.027
and cutting me out of meetings.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.662
- He'd never leave me, either.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:40.368
- And, we were supposed to
go to New York together,

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.803
and meet with Tony
about the building,

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:44.739
and have a romantic
trip, but he canceled!

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.679
So, I decided to conduct
a little experiment.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.483
If something traumatic
in his life happened,

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.319
say, his daughter was abducted,

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.221
who would he run to for comfort?

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:02.657
Me, or Alice?

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:04.158
- That's sick.

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:06.961
- So, I'd have confirmation,
once and for all.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:09.530
And if he went to your
mother instead of me,

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.667
I'd be in the perfect position

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.703
to hurt them very badly.

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:19.207
- She wouldn't do this.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:20.675
- No, it's her, I know it's her.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.378
She's the only person that
I told that Maddy was sick.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.579
- Maybe there's something
on her computer.

01:11:24.681 --> 01:11:26.180
- Just look for
anything, something.

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:28.316
- We need to call the police,
tell them what happened,

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:29.751
and let them take it from here.

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:31.252
- Password protected.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:32.520
Would she keep her at her home?

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:33.588
- No, she lives
with two roommates.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.690
There's no privacy there,

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.091
and she wouldn't do it!

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:39.594
- Do you
have a key for this?

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:41.195
- Somewhere, yeah,

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:42.430
and when we open it up and
see there's nothing in there,

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:43.431
we're calling the police.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:44.632
- Just get me the key.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.670
- You alright?

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:52.240
- Do you think we
should call the police?

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.841
- The longer she's gone,

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.377
the less likely we'll
recover her alive.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.178
You know this better than me.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.813
You were the negotiator.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:01.082
- I know.

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:02.784
I just needed to
hear it from you.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:05.920
- So, we agree, we're
gonna call the police?

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:07.989
- Yeah, we agree.

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:10.525
- Why are you still here?

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:16.698
- It's my shoe.

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:19.133
She was wearing this.

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:26.874
- Uh, don't tell Tony
for obvious reasons.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:29.077
I don't want Brent to find out.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:31.546
Yeah, I'll be there in
30 with the merchandise.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.815
- You're selling me?

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.784
- What choice do I have?

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:38.519
You've ruined my perfect plan.

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:40.888
When your father came
to me for comfort,

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:42.657
I was going to dump
you in the canyons

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:44.158
for some early morning
hikers to find,

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.327
but then you had to go
and pull off my mask.

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:48.663
- No, you aren't
taking me anywhere.

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:50.331
I didn't know until
I saw your face,

01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:52.433
but this is my parents'
office building.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.802
One step closer,
and I'm screaming.

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:56.904
- Everyone has gone
home for the day,

01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:59.440
and I've bribed
the security guard.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.410
Men will do anything if
you wear the right outfit.

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:03.878
Come on.
- Help, help!

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:10.585
- Victoria, Victoria
pick up the phone please.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.521
Where the hell
are you, Victoria?

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:16.824
- I'm sorry to call so late.

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.060
It's just that she has these
papers that I need tonight.

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:23.865
Okay, she's not there.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.267
Thank you.

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:27.702
- Hey, Cheryl, thanks
for calling back.

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.537
Um, any luck tracking the phone?

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:32.774
No worries, thanks for checking.

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.610
Uh, she must have
disabled the GPS.

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:36.911
She gotta be using a burner.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.782
- Brent, where
would she keep her?

01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:42.884
- I don't know.

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:47.221
- There has to be someplace
that you can think of.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.626
- I can't think of
any place right now.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.829
- Maybe some place you
guys kinda went together,

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.397
private and secluded?

01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:57.732
- We were having
an affair, Steve.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.801
Everywhere we went was
private and secluded.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:03.805
- What?

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:06.407
- We used to sneak off at lunch,

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:08.109
to a storage room
in the basement.

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.011
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:13.080
- I told you, nobody's coming.

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:16.417
- My Mom will, she'll find
me and you're going to jail.

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:19.821
- You know, you're a handful.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.590
I don't think I want you for
a step-daughter after all.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:30.932
Huh, too late, Brent.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:32.667
You landed over an hour ago.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.636
You made your choice.

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:38.239
Now at least, I'll make
some money off of your brat.

01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:00.728
- Where is this room?
- It's right here,

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.497
it's right here.

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:04.298
She's not in here.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.500
- They were here.
- What?

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:06.868
- They were here!

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.705
Where was ...

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.146
- Maddy!
- Baby!

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:21.182
- Stay back.

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:25.052
- Please, let her go.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:28.389
- I don't think so, Alice.

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.360
- Why are you doing this?

01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:33.461
- Why?

01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:34.795
Well let's see.

01:15:34.898 --> 01:15:37.098
You've canceled how
many dates recently?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.166
I could tell what
was happening, Brent.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:42.937
I said stay back!

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.805
- What was happening, Victoria?

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:46.541
- You were breaking up with me.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.877
You promised me you
would leave Alice for me

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:52.680
and that we would go
on and build a life,

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:54.615
and this business together

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.784
and you're going
back on your word.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.853
- I'm, I'm not.
- He isn't.

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:01.689
He told me before
he left for New York

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:02.657
that he was leaving me.

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:03.858
- You're both liars.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.160
- Victoria, Victoria
listen to me.

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:08.296
There's no way out of this.

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:12.033
Just calm down, calm
down, put the knife down.

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.570
You can do it.

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:17.271
- Everything is gonna be fine.

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:22.276
Okay, just please,
just let her go,

01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:24.812
and everything will be okay.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.113
- No, it won't.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.482
This was your test, see?

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:32.687
If something went wrong, who
would you run to for help?

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:34.455
Me or Alice?

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:36.657
- Don't hurt my
daughter, Victoria.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:40.595
- This is your test
and you failed.

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:43.598
And now I'm gonna hurt
you like you hurt me.

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:45.733
- Now.
- I loved you, Brent.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.109
- I told you I was
coming for my girl.

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:03.584
- What
time did you arrive?

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:05.953
- I got here
early in the morning.

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:07.989
- How early is early?
- 7:00 a.m.

01:17:09.559 --> 01:17:10.925
- I knew you'd find me.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:15.029
- Maddy, I'd go to the ends
of the Earth to save you.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.131
- This was my fault, I
should have listened.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:18.699
- No, you were right.

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.268
I'm way too
overprotective of you.

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:22.770
I should have trusted you more.

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.639
- Yeah, but, I lied and I
snuck out to go to the party.

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.774
- You did, but I heard
you left the party

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.809
when they started drinking.

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:30.111
You can make the
right decisions.

01:17:30.213 --> 01:17:31.879
- But if you had
known where I was,

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.214
you would have known
something was wrong

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:34.548
when I didn't come home.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.250
- I always say no when
you wanna do something

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:37.918
that makes me nervous,

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:39.820
but I want you to feel like
you can tell me the truth

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:41.722
no matter what I'm feeling.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.592
- I will from now on, I promise.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.827
- And I promise to
trust your decisions.

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:49.563
I mean after all,
you're nearly an adult.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.732
- Yeah, but I still need my mom.

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:56.504
- The police are done
taking our statements.

01:17:56.606 --> 01:17:57.838
We can go home now.
- Okay.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.608
- Alright, let's get a
nice bath, cleaned up,

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.343
some food, that sound good?

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.612
- Dad, how could
you do that to Mom?

01:18:04.714 --> 01:18:06.681
- Maddy, it's alright.

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.785
- I don't know what to
say other than I'm sorry.

01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:12.053
I'm so sorry, and I ...

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:14.822
I just love you
guys both so much.

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:16.757
- Okay, all I care
about right now

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:19.293
is that Maddy gets
home where she belongs.

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:21.629
Alright, we'll deal
with all that later.

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:23.230
- I'll walk you out.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:29.937
- She say anything?
- Not yet.

01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:33.307
- Whoo ...

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:38.779
You're a real piece
of work, Victoria.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:41.015
- It wasn't my fault.
- Here you go, man.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:42.616
Alright, bring it down
to the station, alright?

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:43.551
- Yes, sir.

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.790
- Wow, what a crazy day.
- Yeah.

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:55.696
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:57.031
- It was all you, Alice.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:58.799
You saved her.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.637
- Oh, Victoria,

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.605
you're fired.

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:29.563
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:31.699
- Do you want these photos?

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:33.267
- The lawyer said we had
to turn over everything.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:35.870
- I seriously doubt the FBI

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:37.738
is gonna want our
family pictures.

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:48.883
- I'm sorry to see it go.

01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:49.850
- Not as sorry as I am,

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:52.987
for everything.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:55.790
- I know you are, Brent.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.959
- How's Maddy coping?

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.061
- She's good.

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:05.766
I think this experience has
made her stronger in a way.

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:08.135
- My apartment will
be ready this weekend.

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:09.737
You think it would be okay

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.705
if she came over and spent
a little time with me?

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:12.940
- If she wants.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:14.742
- Well, she wanted me
to check with you first

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.410
and assure you everything
was safe over there,

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:21.081
considering that my past behavior
put our family in danger.

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:22.716
- Just promise me that
she won't get kidnapped,

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:23.818
and I'll agree.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:29.990
When's your hearing?

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:30.825
- Next week.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:33.761
Will you be there?

01:20:33.863 --> 01:20:34.962
- I'll think about it.

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.833
What did your lawyer
say about jail time?

01:20:38.935 --> 01:20:41.101
- He said I could
probably avoid it

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.470
because no money had
actually exchanged hands yet.

01:20:43.573 --> 01:20:45.906
- That's good, for Maddy's sake.

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:52.413
I filed this morning.

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:58.252
I'm not gonna be vindictive

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.320
and go after
everything you have.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:01.021
I want it to be a fair split.

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:05.793
My priority is the health and
happiness of our daughter.

01:21:05.895 --> 01:21:07.328
- I appreciate that, Alice.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:08.729
It's more than I deserve.

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:12.867
Hey.

01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:14.468
- Hey.
- You ready?

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.036
- Yeah, just
let me grab my purse.

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:16.937
- Alright.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:21.642
How's it going, Brent?

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:23.944
- You know, it's been better.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:26.413
- Just keep your head up,
man, things will improve.

01:21:27.283 --> 01:21:29.149
- Thanks for the words, Steve.

01:21:29.252 --> 01:21:33.787
- You know, I want you to
know, I was telling the truth.

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.022
About Alice and I.

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:36.123
We--
- I know.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.926
I was just jealous.

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:43.130
Hey listen, if I end
up going to prison,

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.866
will you watch my girls for me?

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:49.703
- Yeah man, I'll
definitely do that.

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:53.140
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:55.876
- We'll see you later, Brent.

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:58.212
- See ya.
- So where do you wanna go?

01:21:58.314 --> 01:22:02.016
- I don't know, maybe the
coffee shop next door?

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:03.217
Or do you think they'll remember

01:22:03.319 --> 01:22:04.952
that we roughed up some
kid in their bathroom?

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.628
- Yeah, we had a lot
of good memories here,

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:16.563
but the new house is cute.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.999
- Kinda small though.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:21.769
- Aw, we don't need
a house this big.

01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:24.772
And with the business
gone, it's a little much.

01:22:24.874 --> 01:22:27.074
- So, what
are you gonna do now?

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:31.478
- I think it's time
for a new adventure.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.346
- Like what?

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:35.182
- I don't know.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.718
There's plenty of possibilities.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.488
- And, do any of the
possibilities include Steve?

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:47.795
- Maybe, we'll
see how that goes.

01:22:47.897 --> 01:22:48.896
- Yeah, I like him.

01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:51.198
- You do?

01:22:52.935 --> 01:22:56.170
- So, speaking of
new adventures,

01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:58.305
can I go to a party
tonight at Hunter's?

01:22:58.407 --> 01:22:59.773
- Absolutely not!
- Mom!

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.942
- No, you have to stay
in and finish that poem,

01:23:02.044 --> 01:23:04.945
so you can make the
filing deadline.

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:06.814
- Really?
- Yes, really!

01:23:06.916 --> 01:23:08.849
- Oh, my
god, Mom thank you.

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:11.852
- It's gonna be hard
for me to let you go.

01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:13.787
- Mom, you know, we could
take a trip to New York

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:15.556
to check out the
security of the dorms.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.691
- We can do that.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:19.360
- And we need to have
weekly call scheduled

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.862
so that you know
that I'm doing okay.

01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:23.464
- Okay.

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:25.399
- Mom, maybe you could just
like text me every night

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.067
before I go to bed so
that you know I'm home?

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:29.236
- Okay, I think you're
going a little overboard.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.005
- No, but Mom, there
are frat parties.

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:32.172
You definitely need to
periodically remind me

01:23:32.274 --> 01:23:34.575
about the dangers of
underage drinking.

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:36.944
- Oh boy, I've
created a monster!
