WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.457
HENRY: Previously on Eureka.

00:02.628 --> 00:04.209
Boo!
(EXCLAIMS) Holly!

00:04.379 --> 00:05.414
Did I scare you?

00:05.589 --> 00:07.454
You're out.
And you're here.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.290
ZANE: She's dying again.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.088
Sustaining her is going
to take a breakthrough
in computer programing.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.463
Marry me, Jack.
Right now.

00:15.891 --> 00:16.880
Okay.

00:17.059 --> 00:17.969
Bring us home, Henry!

00:18.143 --> 00:20.634
HENRY: Then I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.723
You may kiss the bride.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.070
Wait! Have these.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.353
BOTH: What's that?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.273
Brand new roast for
a brand new marriage.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.149
Sophisticated and earthy.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.988
Thanks, Vince.
Enjoy.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.033
You know, we still have
to fill out the compliance
forms with the DOD.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.492
before we're
legally married.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.203
True. Well, nothing
says lifelong
commitment like

00:43.377 --> 00:44.287
government oversight.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.496
Last chance to back out.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.081
Nope, no way.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.587
I'm in. I'm stuck.
(LAUGHING)

00:48.757 --> 00:51.624
Hey, Mom! You think you
could drop me off at Dre's?

00:51.802 --> 00:56.262
Yeah, sure. I have to get
a visitor's pass for Uncle
Marcus on the way to G.D.

00:56.431 --> 00:59.013
Oh, big brother coming to
check in on little sister?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.765
lt's adorable.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.722
It's more like coming
to check up on you.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.477
(CHUCKLES)
Whatever.
Don't worry.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.354
Wait. She'sjoking, right?

01:09.528 --> 01:11.484
I mean, what's the deal
with your uncle?

01:11.655 --> 01:13.941
He's just sort of
prejudice, you know?

01:14.116 --> 01:15.071
Against white people?

01:15.242 --> 01:18.700
No. Against dumb
people, no offense.
I'll see you later, Jack.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.616
Oh, none taken.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.247
This is amazing.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.292
l'm constructing a
neural digital interface
that can make

01:27.462 --> 01:30.920
an Al. house compatible
with a trans-human life form.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.878
That's not amazing,
it's epic.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.170
Yes, yes, I'm a genius.
Let's find out of it works.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.505
Run the patch now.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.269
Initiating.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.554
SARAH: Ooh, that tickles.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.058
I feel... Accepted.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.402
Well, you are good to go.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.313
Sweet!
Where to first?

01:56.491 --> 01:59.073
Um, he didn't mean
leave,go.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.156
Oh, come on.
I've got cabin fever.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.750
Holly, you're stable.

02:09.296 --> 02:13.005
If we pull you out now,
we risk a catastrophic
synaptic relapse.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.381
You mean I'm stuck here?

02:14.551 --> 02:16.052
Well, no, eventually
we'll get you mobile.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.961
It's just everything
from here on out is
aninnovaï¬‚veleap.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.675
We can't rush it.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.134
How long we
talking, Douglas?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.641
However long it takes
us to get it right.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.602
Okey-dokey.
Love you.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.530
(GASPING)

02:39.451 --> 02:41.362
Zane,
I need your help.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.572
You might want to
review bathroom
etiquette with SARAH.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.864
I'm not staying
long enough to
learn the rules.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.785
You have to get me
out of here. Please?

02:52.798 --> 02:55.585
What the hell is
a reproductive clause?

02:55.759 --> 02:59.001
Well, boss, when a mommy
and a daddy love each
other very much they...

02:59.179 --> 03:00.965
No... That's all right.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.429
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

03:03.642 --> 03:05.428
Something got your
hard drive in
a query, boss?

03:05.602 --> 03:07.558
Allison's brother's
coming to town.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.517
And I think he's checking
up on the schlub
his sister married.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.307
Well, if you don't
mind my saying,

03:13.485 --> 03:16.977
anyone who doesn't see
how great you are isn't
someone I want to know.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.275
Thanks, Andy.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.700
Hey, Kev. What's up?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.359
Hey, I've got a presentation
on alternative
de-silicon computing,

03:24.538 --> 03:25.994
do you think you could
help me practice?

03:26.164 --> 03:28.541
Uh, computers aren't my thing.
I think maybe your mother

03:28.709 --> 03:29.664
would be a better
audience for you.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.996
No, no, you don't have
to like get the details.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.376
| just need to work on
my delivery, you know?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.630
I brought you some
maple bars and
Vincent's new espresso blend.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.961
All right.
Enlighten me, Kev.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.680
G.D.'s already developed
protein-based derma and
vascular mapping.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.340
We've got everything we
need to help Holly.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.884
Except a stable
neural-net processor.
And that's going to be tricky.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.178
What exactly
are we processing?

03:51.356 --> 03:54.598
We can build it.
We have the technology.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.522
Is that for Holly?
I thought she was stable
in the Smart House.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.529
Stable, yes.
Happy, no.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.740
Ah, so you're officially
joining the mad
scientist union.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.528
It's not mad. It's the
next logical step in
brain machine interfacing.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.868
But we need to snag us
some high priority hardware.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.034
Yeah, well, you're
head of Section Five. Ask.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.205
You're not telling Fargo.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.590
He's acting a little bit
overly cautious these days.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.298
Holly's his girlfriend.
He deserves to know.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.712
Yeah, but she asked us
to keep him out of it,

04:24.890 --> 04:26.676
at least until we figure
out if this is even possible.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.761
We tell him now
he might freak out
and pull the plug.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.436
And that's what
I'm doing here.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.686
Running interference at G.D.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.140
Hmm. I'm going
to regret this.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.358
Nice office.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.897
KEVIN: And so, the ability
to manipulate graphene
between states

04:43.074 --> 04:46.908
validates its
status as the ideal
alternative to silicon.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.409
Thank you.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.332
Genius.
I mean, I loved it
the third time.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.412
The fourth time,
grand slam.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.542
I don't know.
Maybe just one more time.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.083
Mmm, Kev,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.290
I could recite it now.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.584
I think you're going
to be fine.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.922
(CRASH)
(HORNHONNNG)

05:05.096 --> 05:06.506
(SHOUTING)

05:08.934 --> 05:10.515
Hey, are you all right?

05:12.395 --> 05:13.305
(GRUNTS)

05:13.480 --> 05:14.469
Ow!

05:16.733 --> 05:18.894
So it's going
to be that kind of day.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.084
Come here!

05:39.422 --> 05:40.753
CROWD: Whoa!

05:48.139 --> 05:49.470
Kev!

05:51.101 --> 05:51.931
Uncle!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.510
ALLISON: Jack!
Yeah!

05:56.439 --> 05:58.976
This is my
brother, Marcus.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.986
(GROANING)
Oh, of course it is.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.773
Nice gams, Sheriff.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.486
Welcome to Eureka.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.756
Well, this takes restless leg
syndrome to a whole new level.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.673
But they couldn't outrun
the long arm of the
brother-in-law.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.966
Nice!

06:34.311 --> 06:36.518
Now let's try this again.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.557
Hi, I'm Jack.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.847
Dr. Marcus Blake.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.233
Do you prefer Dr. Blake
or can I call you Marcus?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.984
I haven't decided yet.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.521
Okay. Behave.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.484
(LAUGHS)

06:48.658 --> 06:50.649
Marcus is fine.
Good.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.365
Good because
multiple Dr. Blakes
would be confusing.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.076
Well, you should
see our family gatherings.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.834
Can't swing a cat
without hitting a PhD.
Right, Allie?

07:01.546 --> 07:04.709
Uh, yes, overachieving
runs in our genes. (LAUGHS)

07:05.634 --> 07:09.377
Mine too, actually.
Just more with
Sheriff-y type stuff.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.804
So is this typical Sheriff-y
stuff for you, Jack?

07:13.266 --> 07:17.930
Well, nothing's really
typical in this
town, but I try.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.602
No, you do great.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.933
Thank you.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.439
So listen, why don't
we go up to G.D.?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.942
I'll give you a tour
of the new labs,

07:26.112 --> 07:28.728
while Jack finds the
owner of our restless legs.

07:28.907 --> 07:29.692
Sure. We can
catch up at dinner.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.152
Okay, good.
All right. See ya.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.282
I can't wait.

07:33.745 --> 07:37.329
All right,
I will see you at home later.
Come on, Marcus.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.964
(SIGHING)

07:46.299 --> 07:47.800
Well, that went well.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.799
Oh, settle down!

07:51.972 --> 07:56.807
I adapted a new interface
layer to the portable drive,
but there's always a risk.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.301
Here we go.

08:04.192 --> 08:08.777
Um. You're sure she was
secure for transport.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.905
Hey guys!
Oh, man, it feels
good to be...

08:16.997 --> 08:18.237
In a garage?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.406
That's not even
a lateral move.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.574
Carter found your
missing legs.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.162
Oh! Are those for me?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.248
Actually, we've moved
past bionic limbs.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.213
Ladies, gentlemen...

08:30.468 --> 08:31.674
A-ha!

08:33.263 --> 08:35.219
Welcome to Project
Habeas Corpus.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.425
Zane, the missing

08:36.599 --> 08:39.727
spintronic microprocessor
prototype and the biotable

08:39.894 --> 08:42.931
from Genetics... Couldn't you
space out your requisitions

08:43.106 --> 08:44.687
just to make my job
a little easier?

08:44.858 --> 08:48.692
No time. No, we need to do
this and do this right before
Fargo finds out.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.602
So what are
we talking here? Cloning?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.986
A transgenic endoskeleton?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.613
Biological fabrication.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.523
Whoa. From the
cellular ground up?

08:55.702 --> 09:00.366
Hold on, you guys
are building a living,
breathing body?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.700
Yes.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.786
By combining
a protein emulsion

09:03.960 --> 09:07.748
and undifferentiated
somatic cells, we can use
her D.N.A. profile

09:07.922 --> 09:11.210
and print her
body on an organic lattice.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.761
Print? Like photocopy?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.134
Yeah, very similar.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.887
Except this inkjet
uses living cells.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.218
(BEEPER WAILING)

09:19.768 --> 09:22.805
911 from Parrish.
More missing equipment.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.264
ZANE: You're going to need
to distract him, babe.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.225
We can't risk
him taking this to Fargo,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.936
othenNise he might shut us
down before we can begin.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.690
(BOTH SIGHING)

09:33.406 --> 09:35.317
Fine.
I'll distract Parrish.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.777
All right.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.859
Let's make us a woman.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.872
Thank you, Dr. Blake,
your work

09:48.088 --> 09:52.422
on organic computing,
it inspired my
post-doc research.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.922
When you're accepting
your Nobel, be sure to
mention that.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.712
Bye.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.593
Everyone loves you,
it's kind of annoying.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.101
Well, don't worry.
You're still Mom and
Dad's favorite.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.684
Oh, yeah,
even after I didn't invite
them to the wedding?

10:08.858 --> 10:12.771
That took us all
by surprise. We didn't
even know you were dating.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.609
Well, it wasn't
exactly planned,
we were about to drown.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.865
Why am I not feeling
reassured?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.195
Sit down.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.866
Listen, it's been
a very intense year
for Jack and I.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.375
We were best friends
forever and we finally
found each other.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.213
He's great.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.874
And Sheriff-y.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.382
Don't be a snob.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.760
I'm being realistic.

10:38.930 --> 10:43.173
What do you really have
in common? He's not
exactly Nathan Stark.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.805
And I wouldn't
want him to be.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.471
Jack is one of the
greatest guys that
I have ever known.

10:49.649 --> 10:54.109
And, yes, he may have
more of an everyman
quality than Nathan did,

10:54.279 --> 10:57.771
but he loves me.
At least keep
an open mind.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.864
All right.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.655
Aloha.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.993
Doctor Parrish? Hey,
how was the unconventional
weapons convention?

11:07.167 --> 11:11.285
If I see another diversionary
devices demonstration I'm
going to flash-bang myself.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.747
Well, we, uh,
we missed you here.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.503
So is there something
I can help you with?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.665
Zane Donovan's head
on a pike would be
a good start.

11:16.843 --> 11:17.832
So you've heard.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.718
The director is
clearly blinded by grief.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.847
Installing Donovan as
head of Section Five
is not only ludicrous,

11:24.017 --> 11:25.973
it is a gross miscarriage
ofjustice.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.054
What's this?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.843
I'm keeping a running
tab of his infractions.

11:29.022 --> 11:33.857
So far he has violated 22
regulations, and that has
just been this morning.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.443
Well, that's just
outrageous.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.275
I'm on my way to see
Fargo about it right now.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.818
Actually, you see,
I'm the one that deals
with rule violations, so...

11:43.995 --> 11:45.986
I'm going to take
care of it for you.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.548
I spent weeks in
that lab trying to give
reliable results,

11:58.718 --> 12:01.300
vowed we wouldn't
come out until we had
a functioning model.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.008
(LAUGHING)
Well, you're here now, so...

12:04.182 --> 12:06.343
I guess that
means it works.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.884
Or you just told
everyone it did.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

12:11.981 --> 12:14.393
Not that you
would do that to people.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.150
You know, I did
a whole presentation

12:18.321 --> 12:20.027
at Tesla based on
your research,
Uncle Marcus.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.688
And aced it, I'm sure.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.816
I couldn't have done
it without Jack's help.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.033
Really? They cover
polycyclic hydrocarbons
in sheriff school?

12:29.666 --> 12:33.750
No. Marshal services
is more focused on
catching bad guys.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.036
And deadly run away legs.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.755
I think, um, for me,

12:47.767 --> 12:53.137
what's most impressive
is how you're using
flexible microprocessors

12:53.314 --> 12:55.600
at one nanometer
0D. for their
current-carrying capacity.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.357
I think that's innovative.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.688
You read my article?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.686
Well, I, uh, scanned it.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.776
Well, aren't you
full of surprises.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.983
(CHUCKLES)
No kidding.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.870
Um, I'm going to go
check up on Jenna.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.420
Kev, would you
mind helping me
clear the dishes?

13:19.382 --> 13:21.213
We'll be back
in a sec.

13:23.928 --> 13:29.139
So Kev, (CLEARS THROAT)
just practicing a speech, huh?

13:30.685 --> 13:32.095
Did you even have a
presentation?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.181
Last year,
but I got an A-plus on it.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.732
Congratulations.
That's great.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.981
And not the point.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.565
Mmm?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.570
I've seen
howjudgmental
Uncle Marcus can be

13:43.740 --> 13:45.276
and I just wanted you
to be prepared, you know?

13:45.450 --> 13:50.444
Look, I know you're
trying to help,
but this is who I am.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.785
I'm not a scientific
genius. I'll never be
a scientific genius.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.746
You can't change that
and neither can I.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.794
Okay?
I'm sorry.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.916
But you gotta admit that
was pretty awesome. Did you
see the look on his face?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.425
I saw the look
on his face.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.802
Come on.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.759
SARAH: Good morning,
Dr. Blake.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.673
Good morning, SARAH.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.260
Hey.
You've been
up all night?

14:16.439 --> 14:18.521
Yeah. Yeah,
I couldn't sleep.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.688
Is that Marcus's
new book?

14:23.863 --> 14:28.323
Yeah. Just so you know,
yours is much better.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.945
Jack, listen, I know
my brother can be a bit
intimidating,

14:33.122 --> 14:35.113
but you don't
have to impress anyone.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.122
Oh, I know. I'mjust

14:37.752 --> 14:38.832
trying to keep up.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.163
You sure you're
feeling all right?

14:40.338 --> 14:42.454
Great. Better than
great, actually.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.499
All right, well, I'll see
you at Cafe Diem later
for the book signing.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.382
Wouldn't miss it.
Okay, bye.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.213
(BEEPS)

14:52.392 --> 14:54.348
Oh! SARAH,
how did we do?

14:54.519 --> 14:57.807
SARAH: Adapting my oven for
the thermal oxidation
process was a challenge,

14:57.980 --> 15:01.268
but I think you'll be
happy with the
results, Sheriff.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.854
Fantastic.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.735
SARAH: You're taking quite an
interest in Dr. Blake's work.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.897
Maybe you have more in
common than you thought.

15:09.075 --> 15:13.318
Well, he deals
in theory and I deal

15:15.748 --> 15:17.033
in practice.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.164
Hey, boss,
what are you doing?

15:26.342 --> 15:29.334
Did you know there
are 42 police codes
associated with trespassing?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.879
That's excessive!
And six, six governing
jugang.

15:33.057 --> 15:33.967
Uh, that's right.

15:34.142 --> 15:38.010
Uh, put into effect in
1987 after an unfortunate
plasma torch accident.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.848
Watch this,
statute 153.2.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.013
Boom! I know.
I memorized them all.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.978
But my programming
already has a database
of law enforcement codes

15:45.153 --> 15:46.233
you don't
need to know.

15:46.404 --> 15:50.147
Yeah, but now you don't
need to know, right?
I'm a complete package.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.576
I'm a one-man wrecking
crew of justice.

15:52.743 --> 15:56.110
But, uh, still room on
the crew for a deputy,
right, boss?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.154
Well, um, actually,

15:58.666 --> 16:01.203
I think I got it
handled, so I can
talk to the DOD,

16:01.377 --> 16:04.164
see if I can get you
reassigned, and as for today,

16:04.338 --> 16:06.795
you got the day off.
Go watch a movie.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.335
Uh...

16:09.969 --> 16:11.300
Okay.

16:14.557 --> 16:15.262
Hey!

16:15.433 --> 16:16.889
Settling back in okay,
Dr. Parrish?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.640
Oh, cut the crap, Lupo.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.473
I know you and
Donovan are doing the
horizontal mambo.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.762
Excuse me?
You're back together!

16:22.940 --> 16:26.057
Obviously that renders you
incapable of conducting

16:26.235 --> 16:29.193
a fair, thorough
and impartial
investigation.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.241
On the contrary.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.572
I'm not happy with
Zane's promotion, either.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.913
Having him in charge of
Section Five only makes
myjob 10 times harder.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.122
Maybe it's time to
call in the big guns.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.539
Actually, I have a better
idea. If you and I work
the case together,

16:49.717 --> 16:51.958
we can take all of Zane's
infractions to Fargo

16:52.136 --> 16:56.550
and get him to reconsider the
promotion. What do you think?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.758
I could really use your help.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.437
The real me won't look
like a creepy department
store mannequin, right?

17:12.615 --> 17:17.279
Relax. The body blank is just
a crash test dummy for your
new neural prosthetic.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.528
Are we sure a spintronic
microprocessor brain

17:20.706 --> 17:22.571
will actually work
with an organic body?

17:22.750 --> 17:26.288
Downloading a consciousness
is a one-shot process,
which is why we're

17:26.462 --> 17:28.327
field testing the blank.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.751
All processors are online.
All systems are good to go.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.089
Let's do this.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.129
Powering up.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.675
ZANE: 50%. 60%.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.761
70%.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.429
Initiating
a neural pulsing.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.349
ZANE: 90%.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.654
(BEEPING)
100%.

17:56.117 --> 17:59.701
Okay. All right,
let's try a command.
Um, just keep it simple.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.323
Done.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.533
(GASPS)
(LAUGHS)

18:06.711 --> 18:08.952
It's working!
I have a pulse!

18:11.007 --> 18:12.713
Neural pulsing
is taxing the system.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.498
(BEEPING)

18:19.223 --> 18:21.635
System's overheating.
Shut it down.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.611
We're going to
fix that, right?

18:35.197 --> 18:38.985
There's no chance the
authorization went into
your spam folder?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.321
Hmm. I suppose
it's possible.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.952
Right. If you
could just have
another look for me.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.909
Thanks for your time.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.665
What the hell was that?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.046
You're either
protecting your boyfriend

18:54.216 --> 18:57.879
or you are the worst
interrogator in the
history of the world.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.710
(SIGHS)

19:00.556 --> 19:03.548
Right. Yeah, that was
a terrible interview.

19:04.477 --> 19:09.972
I'm having a hard time
focusing right now and
I think that it's

19:12.068 --> 19:13.899
you.
Me?

19:14.070 --> 19:15.685
Yeah. You know,

19:15.863 --> 19:18.900
we've never worked
this closely together
and I had no idea

19:19.075 --> 19:22.738
that you are
so magnetic.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.568
Oh.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.741
This sort of thing,
it happens all the time.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.586
And I would be
lying if! said that

19:33.756 --> 19:36.668
I didn't feel something
for you as well,

19:36.842 --> 19:38.833
but I think it is
extremely important

19:39.011 --> 19:42.094
that we maintain
a professional relationship.

19:42.890 --> 19:46.883
Yes, yes.
You are absolutely right.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.970
So, I guess we're going
to have to do these
interviews over again.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.138
I'll take the lead
this time.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.817
Good idea.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.564
I knew I shouldn't have
worn these jeans.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.896
MARCUS: You'll definitely
enjoy this one.

20:01.075 --> 20:03.111
Your uncle's quite
a rock star.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.570
Yeah.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.410
Have you seen Jack?

20:06.580 --> 20:09.196
No, not yet.
Is everything okay?

20:09.375 --> 20:12.492
I don't know.
Has he seemed weird
to you at all?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.706
You talking about,
like, last night?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.620
He was just reading up
on Uncle Marcus.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.085
Yes, and he continued
to read the entire night.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.672
Looked like Marcus's
whole book and mine.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.300
Uh, I've got to go
check something.
I'll be right back.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.725
Check on...

20:27.643 --> 20:30.806
Excuse me,
is there anything else
I can get for you?

20:30.980 --> 20:33.346
I make the best
Belgian chocolate
souffle in the world.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.186
I'm a bit of a molecular
gastronomist myself.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.975
Would you
sign this apron?

20:38.154 --> 20:39.360
Of course.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.445
(SOFTLY) I love him.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.697
There you are.
Thank you.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.404
Jack, good morning.
Hi. Morning.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.818
Would you like me to
sign your copy of my book?

20:46.996 --> 20:50.079
Well, okay. Actually,
I have a couple of
questions, though.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.534
I'll bet you do.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.997
Um, like on page 158,
for starters,

20:55.379 --> 20:58.462
you postulate that
an organic transistor
made of rubrene

20:58.632 --> 21:01.715
could function properly
at room temperature.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.424
I don't think that
takes into account its
nonlinear thermal properties.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.760
Jack, what are you
talking about?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.892
Well, no, Iwent over
your brother's specs and
that processor

21:12.062 --> 21:14.929
is going to overheat at
the speeds necessary for it
to function properly.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.640
And you came to this
conclusion all on your own?

21:17.818 --> 21:20.730
Well,
it's a pretty
glaring error.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.861
Why don't you stick to
writing parking tickets?

21:23.032 --> 21:25.819
Leave the laws
of thermodynamics
to the experts.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.449
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

21:28.454 --> 21:29.944
I can prove it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.786
Come here.
Sorry, sorry.

21:36.879 --> 21:37.959
Excuse me
for one second.
ALLISON: Jack?

21:38.130 --> 21:38.915
Just one second.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.465
(LAUGHING)

21:40.841 --> 21:42.877
What did you
do to my car?

21:47.264 --> 21:49.300
An actual
rubrene processor?

21:49.475 --> 21:51.136
Yes.
You built this?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.971
Well, it's amazing
what you can
build, actually,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.010
with some silicon rods and
semi-conductor switches.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.726
And you added an
extra gate in the back
of each transistor.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.392
Well, you have to because
organic chips have that
annoying switching problem.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.822
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have you tested it?

22:03.989 --> 22:08.608
I was going to,
but your car,
your career.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.494
It's okay.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.780
My design is sound.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.823
Oh, yeah?
It'll hold.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.252
ALLISON:
Uh, Jack?

22:20.214 --> 22:21.829
What are you...

22:26.011 --> 22:27.262
(WHIRRING)

22:27.429 --> 22:29.260
Marcus,
get out of the car.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.177
Marcus!
CARTER: Wait for it!

22:32.643 --> 22:34.224
Jack, shut it down!
Run!

22:37.356 --> 22:38.641
ALL: Oh!

22:38.816 --> 22:40.181
Oh! Oh!

22:41.151 --> 22:43.563
Tough break, college!

22:45.614 --> 22:47.275
Science is fun!

22:58.210 --> 23:02.078
Marcus, I am so sorry.
I have no idea what
Jack was thinking

23:02.256 --> 23:03.496
or how he even did this.

23:03.674 --> 23:04.914
Well, it's not
that hard.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.083
The heat tolerance
index should have
been sufficient.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.501
I don't understand.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.886
Well, that's what
you get for ignoring
Gianni VanDeHey's

23:11.056 --> 23:12.341
principle of
entropic inversion.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.722
Jack, you're scaring me.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.885
If the rubrene
microprocessor can't handle
the heat, what can?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.313
Well, I was actually
noodling around
with the idea

23:18.480 --> 23:21.392
of attaching a pentacene
crystal directly to
a silicon substrate.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.274
Jack,
that's brilliant.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.436
Yes, it is.
And terrifying.

23:26.822 --> 23:27.527
VVhy?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.698
All right, Jack.
You got my attention.
Let's talk.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.359
Okay, I want to
run some tests first.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.993
Oh, that engine's
a goner.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.654
Not on the engine,
on you.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.163
I'm fine.
Let me get my notes.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.744
I'll give you
a lift to G.D.
Good.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.204
Great.
What?

23:42.713 --> 23:43.668
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

23:43.839 --> 23:45.830
Don't worry
about the car.

23:47.468 --> 23:50.084
Andy, you see that?

23:50.804 --> 23:53.216
Um, do I detect
a hint of burnt
fluorocarbons, boss?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.505
Can I get you
a fresh uniform?

23:54.683 --> 23:57.550
Yeah, uh, no. I got it.
What are you still
doing here?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.477
Ijust thought I could
make myself useful,

24:00.648 --> 24:01.854
what with your
family visiting,

24:02.024 --> 24:03.104
maybe
you could pass some
of your work off to me.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.890
Nah. I got it.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.650
Jack?
Yeah?

24:07.112 --> 24:08.613
Ow! Why did you do that?

24:08.781 --> 24:09.770
Jack, there is something
wrong with you.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.610
You have never
studied thermodynamics or

24:11.784 --> 24:14.446
physics and you're
doing work that
could rewrite the textbooks.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.407
I know. Turns out
it's not that hard.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.197
I'm worried about you.
We need to run some
neurological tests.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.788
What I need is
a supercomputer
to run my new designs.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.251
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Uh, my CPU. operates
at 106 teraflops.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.667
That's right.
It does. You game
for a little upgrade?

24:32.346 --> 24:33.836
Really?
If this works,

24:34.014 --> 24:36.471
you'll be the most advanced
supercomputer on the planet.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.678
Ah! Mi cabeza es
su cabeza, boss.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.353
Right. Here.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

24:43.232 --> 24:46.144
You can't put
that kind of untested
technology in Andy's head.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.479
Well, innovation
requires risk, Allie.
You know that.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.064
Jack, listen to yourself.

24:50.239 --> 24:53.402
You're willing to risk
the life of your friend
to test a theory?

24:53.575 --> 24:57.409
Friend? It's a robot,
and if it blows up,
we just order another one.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.785
Okay?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.740
Where are you? Huh?

25:13.053 --> 25:14.509
Mom,

25:16.432 --> 25:17.547
there's something
wrong with Jack.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.181
I know. I've been
taking a look

25:19.351 --> 25:21.558
at the new Vinspresso
blend that Jack's
been drinking

25:21.729 --> 25:25.142
and it has unusually
high levels of
Alpha-GPC.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.019
Look at me.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.476
What did you
dose him with?

25:30.654 --> 25:33.145
(SIGHING) It's a
cognitive enhancement
drug, all right?

25:33.323 --> 25:36.030
It's supposed to increase
memory and cognition,
but only temporarily.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.281
The effects shouldn't
have lasted this long.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.489
Well, something else
must be interacting with it.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.119
I didn't mean for this
to happen, all right?

25:41.290 --> 25:43.451
I was trying to
help him stand up
to Uncle Marcus.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.162
I just need to know
everything that was
in your C.E.D.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.872
And just so that
we're clear, you're
grounded until you're 30.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.882
I kind of figured.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.755
Come on.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.304
MARCUS: Is it
supposed to do that?

25:59.475 --> 26:03.639
Well, red is for dopamine
and yellow's for serotonin.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.553
You know, it's
exhausting having
to explain

26:06.732 --> 26:08.222
every little detail
to somebody.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.982
Wow. I feel
faster already.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.643
(WHIRRING)

26:14.073 --> 26:16.280
There's a huge power
surge in Andy's heat sync.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.284
Well, not unexpected.
Processor power has
increased exponentially.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.240
Which means
very fast.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.280
Thank you.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.573
Voila.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.992
Andy, you are
good to go.

26:28.378 --> 26:32.667
Whoa, I feel a pleasant
tingling in my artificial
neurons, boss.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.956
You're welcome.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.337
Fifteen years of research
and I never came close.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.848
I have to call my publisher.
This could be my next book.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.428
Our book!

26:45.771 --> 26:47.352
I want a field
test, boss.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.639
I want to take
the new noggin
out for a spin,

26:49.817 --> 26:51.273
but I need a
power recharge.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.729
This new upgrade's
really sucking back
the old amperage.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.983
I need to see
you right now.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.490
Yeah, kind of
busy right now.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.869
Listen, Kevin dosed your
coffee with an Alpha-GPC.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.121
He slipped you
a smart mickey.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.543
Yeah, I understood
you the first time.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.919
Uh, Alpha-GPC,
also known as L-Alpha
Glycewlphosphowlcholine.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.872
Did you hear what
you just said?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.665
Yeah, Allison, I'm not
sure if you understand.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.005
I'm in the middle of making
scientific history here.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.465
The tech we put
in Andy's... Huh!

27:23.058 --> 27:24.559
Where's Andy?

27:25.227 --> 27:27.309
Ugh, great. What now?

27:27.479 --> 27:28.559
JO: Do a floor by floor.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.686
We need to know if these
power drains are
a system malfunction

27:30.858 --> 27:32.223
or a real
security breach.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.642
Yes, ma'am.
What the hell
is going on?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.527
Probably some idiot's
experiment disrupting
the smart grid.

27:40.742 --> 27:41.731
I'll be right there.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.571
Someone's
breached our offsite
communications.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.201
I've got to
head to the station.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.159
Don't worry about me.
I'm going to continue
our little investigation.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.789
I have a lead
that I want to
follow up on.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.200
Uh, wait, Parrish...

27:51.378 --> 27:52.663

At least the processor
was undamaged.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.306
ZANE: The bio-printer
checks out clean.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.180
The spintronic
microprocessor
just runs too hot.

28:06.351 --> 28:10.435
And we can't install a big
enough heat sink without
giving you a digital lobotomy.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.642
But you're going
to keep trying, right?

28:13.025 --> 28:16.062
A-ha! Oh, I knew it.
You're so busted,
Donovan!

28:16.236 --> 28:17.942
I knew you were
stealing equipment.

more juice for the jug.

feeling okay?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.056
Oh, I feel terrific.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.718
And once I amp up
the power to handle my new
photonic processor,

28:50.896 --> 28:53.308
I'm going to be the
best deputy ever!

28:53.482 --> 28:54.722
Andy, we need to
get you checked out.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.436
Your heat signature's
through the roof.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.817

Allison, I take
back everything
I said about Jack.

29:52.874 --> 29:53.704
He's a genius.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.739
Well, not exactly.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.035
I ran my tests on
the Alpha-GPC-booster
that Kevin dosed you with.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.714
Oh, are you still
on about that?

29:59.881 --> 30:01.462
Jack, it is interacting...

30:01.633 --> 30:04.466
With my Z-waves. Yeah,
I figured there was going to
be a synaptic catalyst.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.422
It's enhancing your
neural activity to a degree

30:06.596 --> 30:10.214
that I have never seen before.
You are getting smarter
by the minute.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.474
So, he's not
normally like this?

30:12.644 --> 30:15.977
Hardly. I'm working
on a serum to hopefully
counteract the effects.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.605
Why?
The effects are awesome!

30:18.775 --> 30:21.266
No, they're not.
Jack, you're not
you anymore.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.686
I know. I'm better.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.650
Okay, Allison...
Hold on, Jack.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.406
If there are no
adverse effects, let him
finish his research.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.737
He's really on to
something here.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.448
I don't care about
his research.
I care about him!

30:32.622 --> 30:36.331
Allison, for the
first time, I fit in.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.752

back to being the

Andy was a bit too
successful. He's on a

stealing energy cells
from anywhere.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.090
It makes sense.
He's compensating
for the iPS increase.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.424
He almost killed Jo.

we can harvest the processor.

33:33.887 --> 33:34.637
Move!

33:38.975 --> 33:40.761
He could have killed us!

33:40.936 --> 33:43.018
Maybe he was trying to.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.849
(TIRES SCREECHING)

33:46.983 --> 33:48.439
Oh, my God, Vincent,
are you okay?

33:48.610 --> 33:50.316
Andy took the fuel cell
to the freezer unit.

33:50.487 --> 33:54.446
Now, why would
he do that? He knows tomorrow
is Tuscany Tuesday.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.450
Jo missed
him at Cafe Diem.
He's on the move.

33:58.620 --> 34:01.453
FARGO: So we have
an unreasonable, power hungry
robot on the loose.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.739
We've got
to stop him.
What now?

34:03.917 --> 34:05.327
Now...

34:08.880 --> 34:10.165
We think like Jack.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.126
Okay, um, blast him
with ionized nitrogen.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.167
That'll trigger his
fail-safe and terminate
his programming.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.301
Not you,
our Jack.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.756
Andy's looking for
more power, right?
So where would he go?

34:28.108 --> 34:30.895
Hi, honey.
I'm home.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.434
SARAH:
What a pleasant surprise.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.601
What's all this?

34:33.780 --> 34:36.613
l was just setting
up for my book
club meeting.

34:39.703 --> 34:40.783
I won't be but a minute.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.616
I just need a little
afternoon delight.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.209
SARAH: Andy,
what are you doing?

34:49.379 --> 34:50.835
Recharging.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.461
SARAH: Andy, you're unhinging
my CPU. panel.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.377
That will compromise
my essential systems.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.129
Isn't that a pickle?

35:04.978 --> 35:06.718
That's what I'm looking for.

35:09.816 --> 35:13.434
Andy, don't do this.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.311
You're sick.
We can help you.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.400
That won't be necessary.

35:18.575 --> 35:22.443
Dr. Blake,
you need to leave.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.033
Andy,
you're hurting SARAH.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.913
She likes to talk.
I like to shoot.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.535
I admire your
persistence, Miss Lupo,
but we both know

35:31.713 --> 35:33.795
you can't stop me.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.416
SARAH: But I can.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.085
Ooh!

35:40.263 --> 35:40.922
Sorry, Andy.

35:43.016 --> 35:47.134
What did you do to me?
You set me up!

35:47.312 --> 35:48.552
You all right, SARAH?

35:48.730 --> 35:49.515
SARAH: |wi|| be.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.897
Please, let me go.
I need power!

35:53.068 --> 35:55.605
ALLISON: Andy, listen to me.
This is SARAH.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.815
Do you remember
when you were on Titan?

35:57.989 --> 35:58.819
Of course.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.153
Who did you miss the most
when you were trapped there?

36:04.204 --> 36:05.410
Mi casita bonita.

36:05.580 --> 36:10.324
Okay. The photonic processor
is overriding your
emotion programming,

36:10.502 --> 36:14.040
but I know that you
are still in there somewhere.

36:19.386 --> 36:22.048
SARAH: Andy, I need you.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.846
Please help me.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.928
CARTER: Almost there.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.269
Marcus, if you could
align the LO. socket with
the address bus.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.189
Got it.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.813
Are the straps
really necessary?

36:33.983 --> 36:35.234
It's not like I'm
going to subdue you

36:35.402 --> 36:37.893
and head back to
the Smart House at
my first chance.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.686
Right, carry on.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.896
Hang in there, Andy.

36:42.075 --> 36:45.567
Oh, uh,
something's happening.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.698
And processor's out.
Let me restart him.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.338
How do you feel?

37:02.512 --> 37:05.345
Slower. Thanks.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.933
Now if you'll
excuse me, I need to
apologize to my girl.

37:17.318 --> 37:20.025
Oh, we could have learned
so much from an extended
real-time field test.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.936
I know.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.909
But a virtual model
will work just fine.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.747
(TYPING)

37:38.548 --> 37:39.958
Nice to have
our Andy back.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.966
Would have been safer
to deactivate him.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.678
You don't give
up on family.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.596
Look, it was
a risky move.

37:50.059 --> 37:54.052
Yeah, which saved his life.
It's what my husband
would have done.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.562
And I'd really like to
have him back now.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.519
I'm right here.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.858
I'm just better.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.816
But you've lost the
best part of you.

38:04.908 --> 38:05.647
Your heart.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.746
Holly, are you here?

38:15.543 --> 38:19.377
Look, I'm sorry,
but you know I'd do
anything for you.

38:20.089 --> 38:23.331
I guess Ijust got
caught up in what
it would do to me.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.629
I hope you can
forgive me.

38:38.608 --> 38:39.472
What you got there?

38:39.651 --> 38:43.143
Um, I'mjust going
over the specs for
Carter's photonic processor.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.527
It's actually
kind of amazing.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.028
Wait, wait, wait.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.188
Sheriff Carter?

38:47.367 --> 38:49.358
Oh, uh, long story.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.486
Doug, why are you here?

38:56.709 --> 38:58.495
Because you're
my Princess Leia.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.543
You're going to help me.

39:01.714 --> 39:02.920
But I'm not
your only hope.

39:03.091 --> 39:06.208
Henry and Zane think
this bio-printer thing
could actually work.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.217
So, if that's
what you want,

39:08.388 --> 39:10.549
I'll do
everything in my power
to make it happen.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.588
| just want
to be with you.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.307
For real.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.809
We'll find a way.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.473
Cerebral proteins are marked.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.483
I've isolated
the choline stabilizer.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.736
I'm retro-lacing
the G.P.C. upgrade.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.397
It should reverse
the neural boost.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.325
Sure can't wait to have
my husband back.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.821
Oh, you two
work well together.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.535
You're certain
you want to do this?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.165
Yes.

39:40.837 --> 39:41.997
Yes.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.340
So this may make
you a little dizzy.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.091
Let's just hope
this works.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.502
Of course it'll work.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.170
I'm a genius, right?

39:52.348 --> 39:53.303
(CHUCKLES)

39:53.975 --> 39:57.092
It was nice, though,

39:58.146 --> 39:59.636
being on your level
for once.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.476
Jack, you've always
been on my level.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.352
(WHIRRING)
(INHALES)

40:08.323 --> 40:12.316
So it's going
to take a minute for
his vitals to stabilize.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.076
MARCUS: Okay, I admit it.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.737
I may have judged
him a bit prematurely.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.080
Marcus,

40:20.251 --> 40:23.459
Jack Carter may not have
the highest I.Q. in town,

40:25.798 --> 40:27.709
but he's the smartest
man that I know.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.715
Married you, didn't he?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.053
Hey.
(SIGHS)

40:35.975 --> 40:37.476
How you feeling?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.428
Slower.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.649
Thanks.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.904
Don't worry, Jack,
I've learned my lesson
the first time.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.656
Good.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.154
So you want to help
me with my homework?

40:56.329 --> 40:58.320
(CHUCKLES)
I don't think so, pal.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.622
Hey! So you guys
must have made out.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.875
We're right as rain, boss.
SARAH accepted my apology.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.706
SARAH: Uh-huh. Three times.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.587
Yeah.
Thanks for the image.

41:09.509 --> 41:14.378
Uh, listen, Andy,
I'm sorry about what I did.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.804
Don't worry about it, boss.
I'm okay.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.261
As long as I get to
be your deputy again.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.300
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.145
Ready to
make this official?
Yes.

41:25.775 --> 41:28.357
I've never seen my
little sister so happy.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.438
Welcome to
the family, Jack.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.569
Or is it Sheriff?

41:32.740 --> 41:34.196
I'm still deciding.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.323
(LAUGHS)
Thanks.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.701
Okay, just sign
on the dotted line.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.781
After you.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.617
Boss, Mrs. Boss.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.675
Excellent. The documents
have been signed

41:57.849 --> 41:59.760
under conditions free
from stress and coercion.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.515
Do you have a witness?

42:02.061 --> 42:03.517
Uh...

42:06.065 --> 42:07.475
Marcus.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.982
I'd be honored to.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.945
Although, I think she might
like a ring at some point.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.777
Okey-dokey.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.533
Sheriff, Doctor Blake,

42:19.704 --> 42:21.240
I now pronounce you
formally acknowledged

42:21.414 --> 42:22.824
by the
US. Department of Defense

42:22.999 --> 42:24.239
as legally joined
in holy matrimony

42:24.417 --> 42:26.874
as defined by
section 8.7 in the...

42:28.421 --> 42:29.911
SARAH: What he meant
to say was,

42:30.089 --> 42:32.375
"You may now
kiss the bride."

42:33.092 --> 42:35.083
Now that I understood.

42:36.804 --> 42:37.554
Yay!

43:02.705 --> 43:05.196
Subtitling : C.M.C.
