[Bobby] Guys, we are here
in good old Philadelphia.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.440
-Gorgeous!
-Yay!

01:05.523 --> 01:06.816
For Miss Jennifer Sweeney.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.734
[Jonathan] Tell us more.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.487
[Bobby] "She's 48.
She's from Glenolden, Pennsylvania,

01:10.570 --> 01:12.572
and she's been married to John
for 24 years."

01:12.655 --> 01:13.490
[Jonathan] Aww.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.658
[Bobby] "She has three daughters.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.953
Dana, 23, Rachel, 21 and Ashley, 18."

01:19.037 --> 01:20.955
-[Antoni] Cute.
-[Jonathan] I love a trio of sisters.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.999
Very much Haim vibes.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.794
-Very much Dixie Chicks--
-Very much <i>Charmed.</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:27.003
We're nominating our mom

01:27.087 --> 01:30.131
because she's one
of the most selfless people we know.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.093
[Ashley] She doesn't take enough time
to focus on herself.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.427
She only worries about us.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.179
Mom, do you need any help?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.556
-No, I'm good. Thank you.
-Mom!

01:38.932 --> 01:41.684
-[Jennifer] I'm ignoring you!
-[laughing]

01:41.768 --> 01:44.562
The things that she will put aside
in order to do for others

01:44.646 --> 01:46.314
is what makes her a great mother.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.318
I've always wanted to be
a stay-at-home mom.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.653
[Ashley] Mom!

01:52.570 --> 01:53.404
Yes.

01:53.488 --> 01:58.034
I wanted the Donna Reed scenario,
June Cleaver.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.787
I did all the mom stuff.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.331
I did homeroom mom, lunch mom.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.125
I coached their cheerleading team.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.419
I was super mom, so I got what I wanted.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.004
-Love you.
-Love you.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.342
I had what I considered my perfect life.

02:14.425 --> 02:17.220
I had a perfect family, but...

02:18.805 --> 02:20.223
Nothing is perfect.

02:21.975 --> 02:22.892
Ready.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.023
Good job.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.822
In December of 2010,
I was diagnosed with ALS.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.118
My total world was shocked.

02:41.619 --> 02:45.957
It's a neurological disease
that affects your muscles.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.919
The normal life span of someone with ALS

02:50.003 --> 02:51.421
is two to six years.

02:51.796 --> 02:56.092
John, he's had it for eight years.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.468
Sorry.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.180
Everybody takes the vows.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.932
In sickness, in health.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.475
Um...

03:10.648 --> 03:12.108
She's had to live them, so...

03:12.692 --> 03:14.527
it's hard putting her through that.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.904
[both] Wow.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.699
What a terrifying thing though, to be told
you've only got two years. It's amazing.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.910
Sounds like a very
strong family all around.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.077
-Yeah.
-[Jonathan] True.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.416
[Bobby] "When John was diagnosed
and needed to stop working,

03:28.499 --> 03:30.877
Jennifer jumped into the workforce,
and at the same time,

03:30.960 --> 03:32.295
she continued to run the house,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.589
be the number one support system
for her daughters

03:34.672 --> 03:36.382
and act as John's primary caregiver.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.677
Her family sees she's running on empty."

03:39.761 --> 03:40.887
She's a formidable woman.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.474
It's just a constant running
from the time she gets up in the morning.

03:45.016 --> 03:45.975
She's exhausted.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.644
[Dana] She doesn't put herself first.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.647
We just want her to take the time
to treat herself

03:50.730 --> 03:52.941
instead of focusing on everyone else.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.235
[Bobby] "So at the end of the week,
Jennifer believes

03:55.318 --> 03:57.946
she's throwing her daughter Ashley
a college sendoff party."

03:58.029 --> 03:58.988
[all] Aww.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.156
"But in fact...

04:00.240 --> 04:01.532
-Twist!
-...the family wants

04:01.616 --> 04:05.411
the Fab Five to secretly help them
make the party all about Jennifer."

04:05.828 --> 04:09.415
So, guys, our mission this week is
to show this mama that she is the most.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.084
[all] Yeah!

04:18.216 --> 04:20.802
-[Bobby] I'm calling Ashley.
-[rings]

<i>Oh, my God, are you guys ready for us?</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:26.599
-Yes!
-Definitely.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.352
-We're almost there, meet us outside.
-Okay.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.604
[Bobby] I think this is it.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.232
Aww, they have the only tree
on the block, y'all.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.566
-[Jonathan] Cute!

04:38.945 --> 04:41.572

[Fab 5] Hi!

04:45.076 --> 04:47.453
-[Karamo] Did we surprise you?
-Yes.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.955
Nice to meet you.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.375
-[Tan] You seem overwhelmed.
-It's like shocked as... [bleeps]

04:52.458 --> 04:54.669
-[Karamo] Can we take this inside?
-[Jonathan] Lead the way, queen.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.588
Nice!

04:57.672 --> 05:00.842
[Antoni] Very chill, serene vibe here.
I'm very into it.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.803
Did you know we were coming
because it's way too clean in here.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.096
This is...

05:05.179 --> 05:06.264
This is not clean?

05:06.347 --> 05:07.640
-No.
-[Karamo] 'Cause this is clean.

05:08.474 --> 05:12.103
[Bobby] Jennifer's home is one
of the cleanest homes we've ever been in.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.315
But it doesn't really match
her personality.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.359
She's happy, and she's really outgoing,

05:18.443 --> 05:20.695
and then her design is very cold.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.531
[Jennifer] This is the dining room.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.199
[Jonathan] Gorgeous.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.328
I love that you have these directions
for your family in case you should forget.

05:28.411 --> 05:32.332
I'm laughing, I'm learning,
I'm loving, I'm lasting.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.417
What does "love and lasts" mean?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.337
-Love and lasts!
-Love and have a lasting love.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.797
-Going and going and-- no?
-No.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.923
Ha!

05:41.007 --> 05:43.217
[Jennifer]
I have no idea what the hell's going on.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.095
By the end of this week, I'm gonna be
really wanting to do your accent.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.388
Are you offended by it or no?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.099
[laughs] Good luck 'cause
no one understands my accent.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.352
No one understands his either,
so you're not alone.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.644
Something in common already.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.607
You know what's crazy? When you think
about a Philadelphia accent, honey,

05:58.107 --> 06:00.735
she's a first cousin of a British accent.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.281
This Northeastern accent
and even a Southern American accent,

06:05.573 --> 06:07.950
they all used to be British accents,

06:08.034 --> 06:09.827
and I just think that's fascinating.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.746
-We're gonna search the house.
-Okay.

06:11.829 --> 06:15.750
-[Tan sniffs] What do you have cooking?
-A Crockpot! Meatballs!

06:15.833 --> 06:17.043
[Jonathan] Oh, nutty buddy bars!

06:17.126 --> 06:18.753
-Hello.
-[Antoni] Where are the utensils?

06:18.836 --> 06:20.671
[Tan]
We usually ask if we can eat their food.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.591
[Jennifer] I am horrible with decor.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.344
Like, everything will just
revolve around a holiday.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.472
-So, what holiday decor is up right now?
-Graduation.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.140
[Bobby] Ha! Ha! I love it.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.601
Do you guys help partake
in the cooking at all? Or is that--

06:33.684 --> 06:34.644
We try to.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.603
If my dad's cooking,

06:35.686 --> 06:38.481
I'll come home from work
and help him get everything set up.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.733
My dad will take the help.
My mom will not.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.443
[Antoni] Why? Why is she like that?

06:42.527 --> 06:44.612
-She needs control of everything.
-She's the mom.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.949
-She only thinks of herself as a mom.
-[Antoni] Hmm.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.742
-So that's all she sees.
-[Antoni] That's interesting.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.078
Taking care of everyone else
is a distraction.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.164
[Antoni] She doesn't have to work
on herself because she's focusing on you.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.041
I kind of feel like we came
at the best time.

06:57.125 --> 06:57.959
Yes.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.630
[Tan] Oh, my...

07:03.172 --> 07:04.882
Nothing screams sexy like poop.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.343
[Bobby] What's happening in here?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.179
I guess I'm stuck in the 80s.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.849
[Bobby] There's gotta be wood under here.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.268
Beautiful wood!

07:15.351 --> 07:18.062
If it was up to me, this would be carpet.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.063
[groans]

07:19.147 --> 07:21.441
-This would be wallpaper.
-Oh, God.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.985
And that would be popcorn ceiling...

07:24.735 --> 07:25.903
with glitter.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.155
Oh.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.828
I am speechless.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.414
[Karamo] Graduation photos.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.374
Whoops.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.919
Don't know how to put that back up.
Okay, we'll just take 'em all down.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.306
[Antoni] I see crosses.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.391
-Are you guys Catholic?
-Yes.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.185
I'm Polish. He's Irish.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.645
-[Antoni] You're Polish? Stop! Stop!
-Yes.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.105
I have my <i>babci</i>

08:01.189 --> 08:03.024
-and I want you to--
-Stop!

08:03.107 --> 08:06.319
If you were to teach me anything, can you
teach me to make potato pancakes?

08:06.944 --> 08:08.571
Oh, I just got goosebumps!

08:08.654 --> 08:10.990
My ancestors are gonna be
so happy this week.

08:11.073 --> 08:14.285
-Kielbasy and sauerkraut.
-Potato pancakes. Oh, love.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.078
-That's so good.
-[Jonathan] I love that.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.164
-Can we investigate your bathroom?
-[Jennifer] Yes.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.708
-I don't want to cut you off.
-I'm gonna creep around in your kitchen.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.169
We're gonna keep on talking
all things Polish in a little bit.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.670
We are not done yet.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.798
Four in the morning, you stumble out
of bed, and then what happens?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.675
[Jennifer] Then I get my shower.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.720
Then it takes me about five minutes
to do my makeup.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.555
-[Jonathan] Uh-huh.
-And I pull my hair back.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.474
Do you pull your hair back when it's wet?

08:36.557 --> 08:39.143
-You will find out when you take the--
-Yeah, it's a little wet here.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.686
When we put our hair back wet,

08:40.770 --> 08:43.022
it puts too much torque on the hair
so I would prefer

08:43.105 --> 08:46.359
you let it be down on the way to work
and throw it up when you got there.

08:46.442 --> 08:49.153
Can I tell you that
I love your hair color so much?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.239
-It really is so beautiful.
-Thank you.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.823
I love that you raised
three incredible daughters.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.825
You have an incredible husband.
You're his primary caretaker.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.494
-So I get you're a busy person,
-Yes.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.413
but you can use your self-care time
to give back to yourself.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.623
Right.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.792
Okay.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.337
Jennifer's closet is full of color,
it's full of print.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.007
Gosh, I mean, I love a print, but my gosh.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.301
And there's also bling.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.013
Nope, we are not a Jersey girl,
and we are not 17.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.892
I don't think you need to put every one
of your personalities into your look.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.187
Tanny! Tanny! Tanny! Tanny!

09:23.271 --> 09:25.481
[Tan] Karamo. Oh, look how short they are.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.651
-Would you ever wear something this short?
-[Karamo] Yes, I'm a ho.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.819
-[Tan] I know.
-Okay.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.322
[Tan]
Oh, my, Mr. Brown. Oh, my, Mr. Brown!

09:33.406 --> 09:35.825
I love that you've already put
your imaginary heels on.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.785
-Can you give us a full on walk please?
-Of course I can.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.161
[Tan] You know I love a catwalk.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.080
Watch.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.332
Yes, work, work, work.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.712
-Yes, queen. Yes, Bey-- yes, Beyoncé!
-Pause.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.674
[laughing] Yes!

09:52.883 --> 09:55.052
Oh, my God. Got fringe, honey.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.014
[Jennifer] Yeah. I like big 80s hair.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.809
-Wow, Mommy.
-[Jennifer] If we could just perm it.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.936
Absolutely not.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.564
[Jennifer] Listen to this. Girls!

10:07.106 --> 10:07.940
Yeah.

10:08.024 --> 10:08.941
[Jennifer] Perm.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.736
-What about it? It's terrible.
-[Jennifer laughs]

10:11.819 --> 10:13.863
-Yeah. It's a no.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.115
All right,
this is the room I hate the most.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.367
The room you hate the most.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.119
[Jennifer] I don't like cooking.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.246
So it's no surprise
that this is your best friend.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.164
Yes.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.290
[Antoni] Name me things that you make,

10:24.373 --> 10:27.001
other than this lovely
rosé meatball sauce.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.087
Chicken with Italian dressing. Um...

10:30.171 --> 10:31.213
You know what?

10:31.297 --> 10:35.635
You're not as excited talking about this
as you are talking about your <i>babcias, </i>

10:35.718 --> 10:37.261
your Polish grandmother's food.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.096
'Cause it was so good!

10:39.180 --> 10:41.849
[laughs] I don't know how to cook that.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.268
You know what?
It's progress, not perfection.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.312
I just do not have the time.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.940
I know you're busy, and your daughters
are saying how much you do.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.860
Relinquish a little bit
of all this control that you have.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.905
'Cause the center of every home,
especially a Polish home,

10:55.988 --> 10:56.864
-is the kitchen.
-[laughing]

10:56.947 --> 10:59.659
That's where the love happens,
that's where we come together.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.036
-Yes, and I like that.
-Am I right?

11:02.119 --> 11:04.789
We're gonna make them some really
beautiful Polish food this week.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.125
[laughs] I love how you dance with food.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.088
Talk to me about the sexy in your life.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.674
Every woman wants to be sexy.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.343
Well, then, what's this?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.762
Do you mean to tell me

11:19.845 --> 11:23.808
if I don't walk around going,
"Check me out," that's not sexy?

11:25.810 --> 11:26.644
Burn 'em.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.272
Let me tell you my concern
about a lot of this.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.650
Almost all your clothes are massive.

11:32.983 --> 11:33.818
[Jennifer] Yeah.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.697
A lot of my clothes are hand-me-downs.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.656
What's this?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.658
I got that from my sister-in-law.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.826
Do you wear it?

11:41.909 --> 11:44.161
Yes, with a pair of white shorts maybe.

11:44.662 --> 11:48.040
If you see a pair of sparkles,
I want you see them and run.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.751
-There's a lot of sparkle in my closet.
-Yeah, I know.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.878
[laughs]

11:52.962 --> 11:56.006
Jennifer has so much charisma to her,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.092
and I know that she wants to express it.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.010
I don't think she needs
loud clothing to do that.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.138
Rachel just had a birthday,
and she got this really cute shirt,

12:03.681 --> 12:05.266
I think editing is key.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.768
Do you shop ever, for yourself?

12:07.852 --> 12:08.769
No.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.229
It's a big joke.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.732
Rachel just had a birthday
and she got this really cute shirt,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.942
-and I'm like, "Ooh, can I have it?"
-[laughs]

12:15.025 --> 12:16.402
They're like, "No!"

12:16.485 --> 12:17.653
-Yeah.
-So...

12:17.737 --> 12:20.448
You have neglected yourself massively.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.408
Are you open to changing?

12:22.491 --> 12:23.325
Oh, yeah.

12:23.409 --> 12:27.663
Are you excited to have some attention put
on you for once?

12:29.582 --> 12:30.958
Yeah. Yes.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.462
[Karamo] Is this the man cave?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.756
[John]
As much of a man cave I can make it...

12:36.839 --> 12:39.967
-I actually like this!
-with a wife and three daughters.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.510
[laughing]

12:41.594 --> 12:42.636
-Want to sit with me, Bobby?
-Sure.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.804
Scoot over daddy.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.768
So design-wise, is there anything
that I can do to help you?

12:49.560 --> 12:53.230
I mean, part of the reason why we have
the basement set up the way it is

12:53.314 --> 12:55.191
is because everything can stay
on one floor.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.735
I don't want to give up

12:58.778 --> 13:00.237
any freedoms I don't have to.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.364
-[Bobby] Yeah.
-Like, going up the stairs and everything.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.201
Because I know once I stop doing it,
I'm never gonna get that back again.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.911
I don't want that to happen.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.247
We want it to be about her. [sighs]

13:10.331 --> 13:13.584
I feel guilty
that they're having to go through this.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.256
I think it's harder on the family

13:21.300 --> 13:25.137
to know that there's
nothing they can do to help. [sniffles]

13:25.971 --> 13:27.973
And I think that's
the biggest thing for her.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.394
They see the deterioration,
as slow as it is.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.480
And that makes it hard.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.398
Her way of dealing with it is...

13:37.650 --> 13:40.277
trying to take as much control over it
as she can.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.949
And he's afraid
of what's gonna happen in the future.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.327
I mean, she's a caregiver,
which of course, I get it.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.288
You want to provide for the family,
but at the same rate,

13:51.372 --> 13:53.833
-you still want that zest for life.
-[John] Right.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.627
She needs to let go a little

13:56.710 --> 13:59.338
and be less frightened
and all that kind of stuff.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.841
[Karamo] John wants his wife to be happy.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.803
To know that she's gonna be okay
no matter what their family looks like.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.596
No matter if he's there or not.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.979
From what I've been hearing,
it sounds like you go to work,

14:15.354 --> 14:17.106
and then you come home

14:17.398 --> 14:20.401
and then you wash clothes
and then sleep and repeat.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.445
-Mm-hmm.
-What do you do to let go?

14:23.529 --> 14:24.530
To let go?

14:25.155 --> 14:27.783
Usually like, um...

14:29.493 --> 14:30.452
How do I let go?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.498
I do things!

14:34.874 --> 14:38.002
-Like what?
-Like work, clean.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.211
[laughs]

14:39.962 --> 14:42.965
I literally heard no time for you.

14:43.465 --> 14:46.218
What would you think would happen
if you stepped away?

14:49.305 --> 14:51.557
They would know
they can survive without me.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.517
And why is that scary?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.728
I don't know, I want to be needed.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.438
It is a nice feeling to be needed.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.773
-Do you ever ask for help?
-It's my job.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.818
-Why is that your job?
-'Cause it's a mom job.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.070
Like I don't want them
to worry about this stuff.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.825
-I'm loving this. I'm loving it.
-All right.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.370
-Hug, hug, hug. [laughs]
-Oh.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.333
-[Bobby] Cute!
-[Jennifer] Yeah, it's falling apart.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.543
We spend a lot of time out here.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.420
It's definitely my little oasis.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.256
-Why is it your favorite place?
-I don't, it just...

15:24.340 --> 15:27.426
It's outside. I can have a drink.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.512
And it's just easier for John
to get around.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.599
I thought at this stage in our lives

15:33.682 --> 15:36.143
we'd be going out to bars.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.270
But instead, we hang out here.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.274
It's like, we're not out, but we're out.

I wanna show her that she can embrace
being a strong rock for her family,

16:18.018 --> 16:19.895
but she can also give back to herself

16:19.979 --> 16:22.690
in ways that aren't too time consuming

I really want Jen to be excited

16:27.861 --> 16:30.322

-So the frumpy that you see
-Mm-hmm.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.613
is because that's not who you are.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.324
I wanna make sure by the end of this,

20:00.407 --> 20:02.659
you don't ever use that word
to describe what you're wearing.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.203
Okay.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.663
So I've already pulled for you.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.248
-Are you ready to try?
-Oh, yeah.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.168
Jennifer has hit a point in her life

20:11.251 --> 20:12.669
where she's given up on sexy.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.881
I think she thinks that a woman
of her responsibility

20:15.964 --> 20:17.883
doesn't have room for sexy.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.261
She can look ten-years-ago Jennifer.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.849
I mean, Ms. Sweeney.

20:28.143 --> 20:31.271
-You look frickin' fantastic. Oh, my God.
-[laughs]

20:31.355 --> 20:32.898
Wow. Okay, come look at this.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.816
Zhuzh your hair real quick.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.443
[laughs] Gorge.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.444
Lady,

20:37.527 --> 20:39.571
if you go back to the [bleeps]
you've been wearing,

20:39.655 --> 20:42.199
literally that poopy pants
you were wearing.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.535
-'Cause you look so damn good.
-[laughs]

20:48.080 --> 20:49.081
I like this.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.874
[Tan] Good. You love color.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.334
-You love print.
-Mm-hmm.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.671
[Tan] You've got it in a much more refined
and sophisticated way.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.382
And then those shoes.
I call them a transition shoe.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.301
You can wear them daytime, nighttime.
No issue.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.303
I see me.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.888
Good.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.809
[laughing]

21:09.434 --> 21:11.937
[indistinct]

21:13.438 --> 21:17.276
Oh, va-va-voom! Miss Sweeney.

21:17.693 --> 21:21.655
-You look so sexy.
-I like this. I like this a lot.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.241
It's highlighting everything
you wanna highlight.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.368
It's giving you shape. Did we do it?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.537
-Did we nail it?
-Yes. We nailed it.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.497
Give me a hug, forget the hands.

21:30.580 --> 21:34.042
I've never done so much hugging
and touching in my life.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.043
We're huggers. We're huggers.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.055
-What is Port Richmond?
-My home.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.975
-Is this where you were raised?
-Like four blocks down.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.143
[Antoni] Wow.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.978
Oh, my God. That smell.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.063
[Antoni] It's smoky.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.481
-Yes.
-It's pork.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.816

Welcome to Czerw's, how we doing?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.369
-Hey, John.
-Hey, how you doing?

22:09.453 --> 22:11.830
[Antoni]
So this is my dear friend Jennifer,

22:11.913 --> 22:14.499
and we came here
to just check out the shop

22:14.583 --> 22:16.126
and learn how to make a few things.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.212
-Yeah.
-Gotta keep the traditions going, right?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.839
That's why we're here!

22:20.922 --> 22:22.382
[John] We'll teach ya. We'll break her in.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.426
[laughs] I'm so excited!

22:24.968 --> 22:25.802
[John] Let's go.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.432
Guys, you need some aprons,
you're gonna get a little messy maybe.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.642
You're gonna be making some <i>kielbasy.</i>

22:33.393 --> 22:35.812
-I'm making my own [bleeps] <i>kielbasy!</i>
-Yes!

22:35.896 --> 22:36.813
Sorry.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.983
Jen tells me that
she doesn't like cooking.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.486
So I'm gonna take this
with very baby steps.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.655
We're gonna put the meat in the casing.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.990
Learn how<i> kielbasa</i> is made.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.658
Learn how it's smoked.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.661
Learn about where
the food that she loves comes from.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.206
What's this called?

22:54.289 --> 22:55.624
[John] Smoked <i>kielbasas</i> in there.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.710
All pork,
with our family's 83-year-old recipe.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.880
With natural hog casing,
which gives it that nice snap.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.090
Oh, yeah, baby.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.258
Come on around, Jen. Your turn.

23:06.802 --> 23:07.719
Hold it tight.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.764
There you go. Let it out.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.891
-[Jennifer] Sorry.
-[man] Ah!

23:12.974 --> 23:14.309
A little too much pressure, yeah.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.478
Just hold your fingers in it like this.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.355
It's gonna come through to the casing.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.564
Just let it flow out.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.274
You have to be gentle with it.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.819
-[Jennifer] I'm trying!
-[laughing]

23:23.902 --> 23:24.986
[John] I'll twist it for you.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.488
You're doing great, Jen.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.492
-[Jennifer] Sorry.
-[John] Gentle with the meat.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.744
-[laughing]
-Innuendo!

23:32.828 --> 23:36.164
-Nice job!
-[Antoni] Switch.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.125
-All right. Got this.
-[bones crack]

23:38.208 --> 23:40.752
Let's see how gentle you are
with the meat.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.923
[John] Stuff it tight, there you go.
Nice technique.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.134
-It's like I've done this before.
-[laughing]

23:47.801 --> 23:49.177
[John] Turn, turn, you gotta help him.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.722
[Antoni] We're making our ancestors
so proud right now.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.183
[John] Great job. There.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.643
[Jennifer laughs]

23:58.645 --> 23:59.479
Holy... [bleeps]

23:59.563 --> 24:01.064
This is really good, isn't it?

24:01.982 --> 24:04.317
-It's perfection.
-Mmm.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.571
I do have a vision of you making <i>pierogis</i>
with your daughters.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.739
Like, you have a close-knit family.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.283
You're an incredible mother.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.703
My mom was very stand-offish.
It was always hard.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.663
I wanna be the opposite.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.707
You're doing your best to make sure that

24:18.790 --> 24:21.460
your daughters don't have to experience
what you went through.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.379
Yeah, like, that was my job.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.841
But I do want the girls to leave,

24:27.924 --> 24:30.010
even though part of me doesn't.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.845
You need to be needed.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.014
They have to come back
and need me for little things.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.599
-Yeah.
-Like laundry.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.686
I'm the exact same way.
I do it in my relationships as well.

24:39.769 --> 24:43.023
I make sure the person needs me,
so that they can never leave me.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.318
I don't want John to leave me.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.490
I just don't want this to be a fairy tale
and wake up,

24:51.573 --> 24:53.116
and they'll all be gone.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.830
[Antoni] Jen is trying to deal
with a terrible hand

24:59.206 --> 25:00.874
that her and her family have been dealt.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.711
But she cannot forget who she is
in all of this, either.

25:04.794 --> 25:07.756
I have such a tremendous amount of respect

25:07.839 --> 25:10.967
for the way you show up
for your husband and your daughters.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.886
I just don't want you to think that

25:12.969 --> 25:15.972
you have to sacrifice who you are.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.558
-Mm-hmm.
-Know that you're deserving

25:18.642 --> 25:20.810
-of having that little Jen moment.
-Right.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.229
-That's important.
-If there was

25:22.312 --> 25:25.190
just a little bit more time in the day,
that'd be perfect.

25:25.273 --> 25:28.568
-Isn't that a bit of an excuse, though?
-Ha ha!

25:28.652 --> 25:30.654
[laughing]

25:31.446 --> 25:33.865
The whole "I don't have enough time"
is a load of crap.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.200
Crap, yeah because--

25:35.283 --> 25:37.410
You would just find something else
to clean up

25:37.494 --> 25:40.330
-or something else to do for... yeah.
-Yes, exactly.

25:40.747 --> 25:43.083
You have daughters
who think the world of you,

25:43.208 --> 25:45.252
-who are able to help.
-Right.

25:46.002 --> 25:49.506
And if the laundry sits for a day,
the laundry has to sit for a day.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.633
It'll sit for a day. They can get over it.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.761
-You're doing the most.
-[laughs]

25:55.220 --> 25:57.180
-I love being Polish.
-I do too.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.581
Does this body look like it exercises? No.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.125
Actually, it does.
Sister, you got a good body, okay?

26:25.208 --> 26:29.254
But listen, I'm more of a sit down,

-Okay.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.267
-...find moments for yourself.
-Right.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.060
Do you get to do this at all?

26:44.144 --> 26:45.854
I don't do this.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.607
'Cause I don't make time for it,
first of all.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.609
The other thing is, like,

26:50.692 --> 26:53.069
I don't like getting stuck in my head.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.364
I don't like silence.
I don't like being alone.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.993
Well, that makes sense.
That's why you keep yourself in chaos.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.496
It's your way of really avoiding

27:04.497 --> 27:06.333
the emotions,

27:06.416 --> 27:08.418
everything that's going on in your life.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.920
To, like, not focus on the inevitable.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.592
-[sobs] I don't want to lose him.
-Yeah.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.677
And I don't have a choice.

27:20.305 --> 27:25.477
And to me, it's like the longest,
drawn-out breakup. [sniffles]

27:25.560 --> 27:29.356
Because like nothing I can do
to save him.

27:31.524 --> 27:34.152
That's why you're trying
to control everything else.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.905
Her husband has ALS.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.450
He is deteriorating
in front of their eyes.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.370
So she's keeping herself mixed
in this chaos

27:43.453 --> 27:45.664
so she doesn't have to deal
with her emotions

27:45.747 --> 27:47.749
and the fact that
she can't control this.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.168
You gotta be able to take the moment
to stop and say,

27:50.251 --> 27:52.462
"I'm releasing myself from all this chaos,

27:52.545 --> 27:55.006
so that way I can hear how you feel."

27:55.090 --> 27:58.468
Talk to John more about how he's feeling.
You talk about how you're feeling.

27:59.969 --> 28:03.139
I know it's hard for you to be sitting
in limbo, of like...

28:03.682 --> 28:05.642
"Tomorrow does he get worse?"

28:05.725 --> 28:07.227
-It's hard.
-Right.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.105
I know it's not the life that
you thought was gonna happen,

28:10.188 --> 28:12.232
-but he's still here today.
-Right.

28:13.274 --> 28:16.319
I just want ten years ago back.

28:16.403 --> 28:20.573
I want to do things me and John
used to do.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.243
But he can't do them anymore.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.203
I don't want it to--

28:26.329 --> 28:27.997
[sobs] I don't want it in the past.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.916
-Yeah.
-I want my future.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.086
[Karamo]
I know she feels utterly helpless.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.296
And it's stopping her
from enjoying the present.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.259
Though this is not the life she expected,
she needs to enjoy the moments

28:39.342 --> 28:42.011
with her daughters and her husband
while he's still here.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.514
I love a metaphor.
I don't know if you know that about me.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.432
Okay.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.058
This is a path.

28:47.517 --> 28:51.563
You can look back on the path and say,
"I walked that and it was fun."

28:51.896 --> 28:52.731
It was.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.023
-Wasn't it?
-Yes.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.153
"I might not know
what's going to be happening up there.

28:59.654 --> 29:03.658
But I do know that, that was excellent."

29:04.743 --> 29:05.994
Can you say that?

29:07.495 --> 29:08.663
That's beautiful.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.792
That's scary as hell.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.961
-But I can do it.
-You can do it.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.673
I can do it.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.760
You can definitely do it.

29:22.302 --> 29:26.139

a metaphor, could've done it with beer.

<i>♪ Hey, hey, whoa-oh! ♪</i>

29:52.248 --> 29:53.374
<i>♪ Ahhh! ♪</i>

29:55.084 --> 29:57.086
[Jonathan] This is our oasis, Jennifer.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.798
This is out of my league.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.008
But you're meant to be
in a pretty gorgeous salon.

30:02.091 --> 30:02.926
Okay.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.554
I love your natural hair color,
first of all.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.766
I like the white in here.

30:09.849 --> 30:10.934
I love the white there.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.894
But then everyone's always like,

30:13.436 --> 30:15.438
"You should go lighter.
You should go lighter."

30:15.522 --> 30:19.526
What would you say
if someone said to your daughters,

30:19.609 --> 30:21.277
"You really should
change your appearance"?

30:21.361 --> 30:24.614
To them I'd say, "Mind your own business
before I punch you in the face."

30:24.697 --> 30:27.534
Yes. This guy who I learned
to do color from used to say,

30:27.617 --> 30:30.578
"Just 'cause you're Ameri-can
doesn't mean you Ameri-should."

30:31.579 --> 30:33.665
Growing your gray out is so brave,

30:33.748 --> 30:35.416
but it's also really beautiful.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.127
No, I don't need to embrace your ideals
of beauty.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.588
I don't need to change who I am.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.966
I want more silver-haired divas
in the world.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.300
This is stunning.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.177
But I do want
to do a really fierce little haircut.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.555
I want to do a little shine treatment
to give this hair some shine.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.764
-Right.
-And have you ever had

30:49.848 --> 30:51.516
-a lash extension or heard of them?
-No.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.143
-It's like 45 minutes of quiet time.
-Okay.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.479
It's not like getting your highlights
and a haircut

30:56.563 --> 30:58.523
-Right.
-and having a whole day at the salon.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.692
You get to close your eyes and just relax.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.193
-Okay!
-Yeah.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.319
Let's go for it.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.283
This queen's always running,
always working, always doing.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.660
Yes, it's her time to relax.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.623
You're so pretty.

31:19.752 --> 31:23.506
Jennifer's been in this state
of giving and giving and giving.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.092
So this is such a good time
for Jennifer to slow down

31:26.175 --> 31:28.177
and learn how to get into some self-care

31:28.261 --> 31:30.972
and know that that will
actually better prepare her

31:31.055 --> 31:32.849
to be the caretaker that she is.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.476
[Jennifer] I am taking all of this in.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.147
-[Jonathan] It's so hard for you to relax.
-[laughs] Yes.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.733
Well, you're learning to do something
that's uncomfortable for you.

31:41.816 --> 31:45.695
But this is a good time in your life
to have this lesson.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.530
You're still gonna have some kids
in the nest,

31:47.614 --> 31:51.034
but you still can start a transition
of making more time for yourself

31:51.117 --> 31:53.411
-even though they're still there.
-They're still there.

31:53.494 --> 31:54.746
They're adults now.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.957
-But we can--
-I gotta accept that. Yeah.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.043
They do look up to you,
and they are looking to you,

32:00.126 --> 32:02.837
and you still do have the ability
to maternally influence.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.755
Right.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.966
-I do need to slow down.
-Yeah.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.555
You're giving me Stacy London realness.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.267
Yes, queen!

32:18.353 --> 32:19.938
I need to do this more often.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.398
[Jonathan] You do, queen.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.485
We're gonna let these rollers sit,

32:25.568 --> 32:27.695
-then I'm gonna finish styling your hair
-Okay.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.572
-after we get your lashes done.
-Okay.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.368
[Jonathan]
You're gonna get such an impact.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.079
Linerless existence
while we have our lashes.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.541
-[Jennifer] I'm excited about the lashes.
-Your lashes are gonna be really pretty.

32:41.501 --> 32:42.543
Yes, living.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.546
Jennifer takes to self care
like a swan in water.

32:45.922 --> 32:46.756
Yes.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.257
She is living for this.

32:48.341 --> 32:49.884
She is thriving.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.930
She is serving me Jasmine and Aladdin
a whole new world.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.058
Are you ready to see
the new gorgeous Jennifer?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.559
Three, two..

32:58.977 --> 33:01.437

33:02.146 --> 33:03.106
Wow.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.859
Ha. [laughs]

33:06.943 --> 33:07.860
I love it.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.862
-You can get all up in it and look.
-Yeah.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.535
-It's big. I mean, it is big.
-I love big.

33:15.618 --> 33:18.204
I wanted you to see that
it can be glamorous, queen.

33:18.287 --> 33:19.622
My God. Yes.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.207
-Do you love it?
-Yes.

-Hey, kids

Just listen to the sound of my voice.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.412
[Tan] Oh, my gosh, I can already tell
your makeup and hair are flawless.

-Yeah, you can.
-Yes, you can!

[Jennifer] Oh, my God, this is gorgeous.
This is carpet.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.549
[Bobby] Because you seemed like
you really loved carpet.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.885
You wanted popcorn ceilings,
and I refused.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.512
[Jennifer] Okay, that I can understand.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.388
I wanted to have a beachy vibe to it.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.725
-Like a breath of fresh air.
-[Jonathan] Oh, I love that.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.727
[Jennifer] Oh, my God.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.229

35:06.813 --> 35:10.983
-[bleeps] It's a bar! It's a bar!
-Of course, girl!

-I see you. I've met you. I know you.
-Bobby's a man after your own heart.

Oh, my God. I am not an alcoholic,
I swear.

35:21.744 --> 35:25.706

new mirror, new lights.

like, the darkness of the table

35:29.001 --> 35:31.087
-with the lightness of the chairs.
-Wow.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.423
[Bobby] In here, some new bedding,
some new pillows.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.217
-Just zhuzhed it a little.
-[Jennifer] Okay.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.803
-Oh, my God!
-[laughing]

35:39.554 --> 35:41.305
Side note, your hair looks incredible.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.892
You kept the streak. I didn't know--
I love that you didn't get rid of it.

35:45.434 --> 35:48.146
And as you can see, we did the tiniest
little zhuzh on her lashes.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.438
-Yes!
-[Karamo] They pop your eyes.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.482
-They really do.
-Oh, I'm so excited.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.526
The bar and the lashes,
that did it for her.

[Antoni] Jen,

35:57.488 --> 35:59.574
-after we leave, there's a big situation.
-[Jennifer] Yeah.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.285
-So for food, I have fresh <i>pierogis.</i>
-Okay.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.412
-Czerw's is gonna cater the situation.
-Ooh!

36:04.495 --> 36:05.496
And next thing.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.374
-I thought we'd make potato<i> latkes.</i>
-Yes.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.669
-[Antoni] So on a simple box grater...
-Okay.

36:11.752 --> 36:14.589
...you'll just grate potatoes
and grate an onion.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.632
This is apparently how
every Polish grandma makes them.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.177
So we're gonna line a bowl like this.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.761
-With a kitchen towel.
-Okay.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.139
And I'm gonna ask you to keep on squeezing

36:23.222 --> 36:25.600
and get rid of as much moisture
as you possibly can.

36:25.683 --> 36:29.729
Oh, you're such a Polish mom right now,
and I mean that in the best way possible.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.772
And now some flour.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.482
Along with the egg.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.444
It's gonna help to be like a binder.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.115
And I'm gonna sprinkle in
just a little bit of baking soda.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.327
-Beautiful. You are honoring<i> </i>your <i>babcia.</i>
-Right. My <i>babci.</i>

39:34.747 --> 39:36.248
[Tan] John can't take his eyes off her.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.249
[Jennifer] Come on!

39:37.333 --> 39:40.252
Whoa. This is not our house.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.381
-[John] Oh, my God.
-[daughters] Oh, my God.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.509
Oh! This is not real life!

39:47.218 --> 39:48.636
[Bobby] It's real life, girls.

39:49.178 --> 39:51.305
-What is that? Oh, yes!
-[laughing]

39:51.389 --> 39:52.973
I didn't even see that.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.309
-[laughing]
-[Antoni] Oh!

39:55.393 --> 39:56.894
That family loves a bar.

39:56.977 --> 39:59.480
I was always very proud of the closet.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.235
[Rachel] Saucy! Oh, my God, I love it.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.028
And all this is my size.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.738
-[laughing]
-Oh!

40:07.822 --> 40:08.989
-[Jennifer] This is mine.
-[Rachel] All these years

40:09.073 --> 40:10.324
I have to share my clothes with you.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.703
Now that you've got a new wardrobe,
and suddenly, sharing is no longer caring.

40:14.787 --> 40:16.247
She actually looks pissed.

40:16.330 --> 40:19.250
If I had mute on this, I would think
I was watching <i>Jerry Springer, </i>honey.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.210
-She was like--
-Unh-unh-unh-unh.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.170
[Jennifer] For dinner tonight,

40:23.254 --> 40:26.298
we are having a typical Polish meal.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.262
I'm gonna make some potato pancakes.

40:31.345 --> 40:34.306
[Tan] I love the accent.
She just said "potato pancakes."

40:34.390 --> 40:35.891
[laughing]

40:36.016 --> 40:38.060
[Jennifer] We have <i>pierogis,</i>

40:38.144 --> 40:40.813
-and you guys grill the <i>kielbasy</i> for me.
-Okay.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.691
She's a delegation station,
and she's the captain, honey.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.733
It's amazing.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.193
We gotta flip it.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.447
[Dana] They look good.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.741
-We're doing pretty good.
-[Antoni] Yes! Ignite that passion.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.035
Mmm.

40:55.870 --> 40:59.248
[laughs] Are you gonna do that every time
you walk by there now?

40:59.331 --> 41:01.375
I cannot stop looking in the mirror.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.003
-[John] You look great.
-[Jennifer] Thank you.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.296
-I missed you.
-I missed you.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.256
It was a long, crazy week.

41:07.339 --> 41:08.924
-The way she looks at him.
-[Antoni] Yeah.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.968
-She loves him.
-Yes, you can see that.

41:12.428 --> 41:17.099
We don't often say it, but we're all
very thankful for everything you do.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.268
Awww.

41:19.351 --> 41:23.606
It must be so nice for him to see
the person giving him care be cared for.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.026
I'm grateful that you guys see what I do.

41:27.568 --> 41:28.444
But I need help.

41:30.112 --> 41:31.989
Like, they're not kids anymore.

41:32.072 --> 41:35.242
We gotta start treating them like adults.

41:35.784 --> 41:37.870
Things are gonna change
around here, mister.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.080
-[laughs]
-Oh, finally.

41:40.164 --> 41:43.834
She was running the household
like she still had infant children.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.086
These are grown women in the house,
they can help.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.006
I got a lot out of my time with Karamo.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.674
We went hiking.

41:51.091 --> 41:54.553
And what he was saying,
what I took out of it was...

41:56.430 --> 41:57.973
I gotta live for today.

41:59.350 --> 42:03.312
But enjoy the beauty of the past.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.442
Like, I tried to live in yesterday

42:08.901 --> 42:12.196
'cause I enjoyed it so much.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.783
And it's behind me. It was beautiful.
[sniffling]

42:16.116 --> 42:17.952
But I gotta live,

42:18.577 --> 42:20.412
and not be afraid of tomorrow.

42:20.996 --> 42:21.872
[Karamo] Oh.

42:22.748 --> 42:26.460
How important is it to really say,
"Let's live for today

42:26.544 --> 42:28.212
and not worry about tomorrow"?

42:28.295 --> 42:30.714
Because that's all the moments you have,
is right now.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.633
Especially her saying it to John,
it's so powerful.

42:32.716 --> 42:33.551
Absolutely.

42:33.634 --> 42:34.927
-Love you.
-I love you more.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.180
[Dana] We did it!

42:38.264 --> 42:40.266
-And you didn't burn the deck down.
-I know.

42:40.349 --> 42:41.600
Brand-new deck. it's not on fire.

42:41.684 --> 42:42.893
[Bobby snorts]

42:44.770 --> 42:46.397
Oh, my gosh, they're all helping.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.440
-[shouts]
-[laughing]

42:48.524 --> 42:51.360
-[Karamo] Look at her, good job.
-I love a good flip.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.697
Now we're getting the party started!

42:55.573 --> 42:57.700
-You look so pretty.
-[Jennifer] Thank you.

42:57.783 --> 43:00.369
It doesn't look like we're
in the same house.

43:03.622 --> 43:05.249
I like the eyelashes.

43:05.332 --> 43:06.959
Those lashes look so good.

43:07.042 --> 43:09.044
[Jennifer] They're extensions.
They don't come off.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.754
Oh, really?

43:11.338 --> 43:13.424
[Jennifer] There is all this Polish food.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.926
And I made potato pancakes.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.638
-Aww!
-Polish people!

43:20.347 --> 43:21.724
This is really good.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.310
[Tan] She's so happy to see her family.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.312
I know. Yeah.
The Poles, they love their families.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.775
So I just want to thank everyone
for coming.

43:32.359 --> 43:34.153
But this is not for me.

43:34.570 --> 43:37.406
We want to celebrate you,
and everything that you do for us.

43:37.489 --> 43:40.993
So basically, it's not my party.
It's Mom's party!

43:41.076 --> 43:42.578
-[cheering]
-[man] Surprise!

43:42.661 --> 43:43.996
Awww!

43:44.622 --> 43:45.956
She deserves it.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.959
You are the heart and soul of this family.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.795
And you've dedicated your life
to taking care of us.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.174
You deserve to put all of that time
and effort into yourself, too.

43:55.257 --> 43:57.676
[Dana] And we hope this week taught you

43:57.760 --> 44:01.722
to see the strong amazing woman
that we see in you every day.

44:01.805 --> 44:03.057
so open and so clean,

44:07.353 --> 44:09.563
You walk in here now,
everything is just...

44:10.314 --> 44:12.399
so open, and so clean,

44:12.483 --> 44:16.654
and it's kind of the way I feel
about myself right now.

44:16.737 --> 44:17.571
Like...

44:18.113 --> 44:20.199
I spent two hours sitting still

44:20.282 --> 44:22.451
getting these freaking eyelashes done.

44:22.534 --> 44:24.620
[laughing]

44:24.703 --> 44:26.622
Aww, look at them!

44:27.539 --> 44:29.875
And I thank you guys
for every bit of support

44:29.958 --> 44:32.878
'cause I couldn't do what I do
without your help.

44:32.961 --> 44:33.837
Everybody's.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.634
[all] Awww!

44:38.759 --> 44:42.096
She's like, "You little... [bleeps]
making me cry at my party."

44:43.263 --> 44:46.475
My hope for people
who are in a position like Jennifer

44:46.558 --> 44:48.227
is that they don't neglect themself.

44:48.310 --> 44:51.647
[Karamo] Things are not gonna fall apart
if you take time for yourself.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.859
You're too special to ignore your needs...

44:56.443 --> 44:57.611
Queen.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.197
[speaking Polish]

45:00.280 --> 45:02.282
[cheering]

45:03.158 --> 45:04.743
[imitates Jennifer]
To the mom who's the most.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.161
[laughing]

45:06.662 --> 45:07.496
-Cheers.
-[Bobby] Yeah!

45:08.497 --> 45:10.165
-You're vile.
-[laughs]

45:15.003 --> 45:16.714
Here's the 511 on dirty martinis:

45:17.464 --> 45:18.924
Five parts chilled vodka.

45:19.341 --> 45:20.175
Or gin.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.095
One part vermouth.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.598
One part olive juice.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.143
That's what makes it dirty.

45:30.644 --> 45:32.604
Shaken or stirred.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.442
And always pour
into a chilled martini glass.

45:38.110 --> 45:40.446
Finally, garnish with blue cheese olives.

45:44.032 --> 45:45.075
Keep it dirty.
