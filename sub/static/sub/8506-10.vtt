WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:05.517
In 2166 an immortal
tyrant named Vandal Savage

00:05.519 --> 00:07.686
conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.

00:07.688 --> 00:09.521
I have assembled an elite team

00:09.523 --> 00:12.091
to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.

00:12.093 --> 00:14.860
Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body

00:14.862 --> 00:18.163
I'd sworn my allegiance
to, the Time Masters.

00:18.165 --> 00:20.466
In the future, my
friends may not be heroes,

00:20.468 --> 00:22.301
but if we succeed,

00:22.303 --> 00:25.337
they will be remembered as legends.

00:27.441 --> 00:30.376
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:30.378 --> 00:32.610
Two years. You left us stranded in 1958.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.747
I was happy with the
life we built together,

00:34.749 --> 00:36.582
the one I thought would be our future.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.037
Chronos attacked us.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.612
He sabotaged the ship and took Snart.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.983
If you're gonna kill, you could
at least tell me what's going on.

00:44.605 --> 00:46.205
The Time Masters,

00:46.207 --> 00:48.474
they took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

00:48.476 --> 00:51.711
I've spent lifetimes training
by them, being reborn.

00:51.713 --> 00:53.813
Don't kill him.

00:53.815 --> 00:55.681
The Time Masters took one of our own

00:55.683 --> 00:57.316
and turned him against us.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.618
I say we undo their handiwork.

01:05.706 --> 01:09.208
I trust that you're comfortable, Mr. Rory.

01:12.713 --> 01:14.713
Or do you answer to Chronos these days?

01:14.715 --> 01:16.749
I don't take orders from you.

01:16.751 --> 01:18.651
I can't believe I ever did.

01:18.653 --> 01:21.320
Well, that's debatable.

01:23.758 --> 01:26.859
I'm calling on you for two reasons.

01:26.861 --> 01:30.396
First, we could use your help.

01:30.398 --> 01:32.331
What's the second reason?

01:32.333 --> 01:35.034
We're headed to 2147 to engage Savage.

01:35.036 --> 01:38.437
Is that the second reason or the first?

01:38.439 --> 01:41.240
Ah, forget it.

01:41.242 --> 01:43.943
I owe you an apology, Mr. Rory.

01:43.945 --> 01:45.411
I failed you.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.112
I brought you along on this mission

01:47.114 --> 01:50.249
under false pretenses, in
denial of your true nature.

01:50.251 --> 01:53.152
And when that nature took its course,

01:53.154 --> 01:57.857
I asked Mr. Snart to...

01:57.859 --> 02:01.660
deal with you.

02:01.662 --> 02:04.029
My point being,

02:04.031 --> 02:06.232
your quarrel should be
with me and not with him.

02:06.234 --> 02:10.068
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

02:10.071 --> 02:12.571
I want to kill both of you.

02:14.842 --> 02:18.978
Captain, we've arrived at 2147.

02:18.980 --> 02:20.913
Thank you, Gideon.

02:20.915 --> 02:24.917
Set a course for the Kasnian Conglomerate.

02:24.919 --> 02:28.020
150 years in the future and
people are still wearing wool?

02:28.022 --> 02:30.089
- Man, I hate wool.
- Be grateful, Mr. Jackson.

02:30.091 --> 02:32.091
Those living outside
the Kasnian Conglomerate

02:32.093 --> 02:33.459
are dressed in rags.

02:33.461 --> 02:34.793
Conglomerate?

02:34.795 --> 02:36.262
Yes, in the year 2080,

02:36.264 --> 02:38.931
government began to
give way to corporations.

02:38.933 --> 02:40.399
More like 2008.

02:40.401 --> 02:42.434
According to Gideon, in two hours time,

02:42.436 --> 02:44.870
our favorite immortal psychopath
is scheduled to attend a meeting

02:44.872 --> 02:46.772
of the Conglomerate's share holders.

02:46.774 --> 02:48.340
Ooh, sounds exciting.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.277
You think Savage takes over
the world by trading stocks?

02:51.279 --> 02:52.912
What we do know is, in 20 years time,

02:52.914 --> 02:54.947
Kasnia is the foothold from which Savage

02:54.949 --> 02:56.548
takes over the world, so we hardly want

02:56.550 --> 02:58.684
to take him on there,
but if we can figure out

02:58.686 --> 03:03.122
how his actions here
lead to his rise to power,

03:03.124 --> 03:04.456
then we won't need to.

03:04.458 --> 03:06.258
Copy that, Captain,

03:06.260 --> 03:08.127
but if we're gonna be
checking out the future...

03:08.129 --> 03:11.230
We should probably invite the nerd twins.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.731
You know, I can already hear

03:12.733 --> 03:14.700
what Stan's gonna say about 2147.

03:14.702 --> 03:16.235
The future, it's...

03:16.237 --> 03:18.504
- Fascinating.
- Astonishing.

03:18.506 --> 03:21.440
Well, it was a 50-50 chance
which one he'd choose.

03:21.442 --> 03:24.643
- Actually I was going to say, "Remarkable."
- Isn't it?

03:24.645 --> 03:28.280
2147 was considered the world's zenith.

03:28.282 --> 03:29.982
All of these people have five good years

03:29.984 --> 03:31.016
to look forward to.

03:31.018 --> 03:32.484
Before what?

03:32.486 --> 03:33.752
Before a ruthless dictator

03:33.754 --> 03:35.554
named Per Degaton comes to power,

03:35.556 --> 03:39.058
releases the Armageddon Virus,
and most of them end up dead.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.060
Well, that's depressing.

03:44.598 --> 03:46.665
Whoa.

03:46.667 --> 03:50.402
Is that my suit? That's my suit.

03:53.207 --> 03:54.940
Aah!

03:57.912 --> 04:01.447
You have been identified
as violating Ordinance 12.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.816
That is how Per Degaton's father Tor

04:03.818 --> 04:07.286
maintains order in Kasnia.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.455
Doesn't look like progress to me.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.523
Speaking of progress, we need
to get a better lay of the land.

04:11.525 --> 04:12.758
And I need to get a better look at how

04:12.760 --> 04:14.460
they made my suit autonomous.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.462
Well, why don't you take
Martin and Jax with you?

04:16.464 --> 04:20.099
Ms. Lance, Mr. Snart, and I
will work on locating Savage.

04:21.836 --> 04:23.736
Tor Degaton holds daily meetings

04:23.738 --> 04:25.104
with his board of directors.

04:25.106 --> 04:26.705
And it's open to the public?

04:26.707 --> 04:27.906
'Course not.

04:27.908 --> 04:30.009
Just Kasnia's shareholders.

04:30.011 --> 04:32.745
I hate to break it to you,
but we're not shareholders.

04:32.747 --> 04:36.915
I'm more of a hard asset man, myself.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:47.995 --> 04:49.661
You're clear to attend.

04:49.663 --> 04:51.263
They'll have to wait outside.

04:51.265 --> 04:52.564
Oh, no, this is my accountant,

04:52.566 --> 04:55.801
and she is my personal
assist... bodyguard.

04:55.803 --> 04:58.303
Stockholders only.

05:05.312 --> 05:06.979
We've been through this.

05:06.981 --> 05:09.248
I won't put the resolution to a vote.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.083
Sir, with greatest respect,

05:11.085 --> 05:13.719
the situation outside
the Conglomerate's borders

05:13.721 --> 05:15.654
is becoming untenable.

05:15.656 --> 05:18.223
The food riots, climate change.

05:18.225 --> 05:20.392
I am well aware that the
world outside our walls

05:20.394 --> 05:22.995
is descending into chaos,

05:22.997 --> 05:25.464
but causing chaos cannot
be a proper response

05:25.466 --> 05:28.067
It is not chaos.

05:28.069 --> 05:29.701
It is logic.

05:29.703 --> 05:32.271
The world's population is unsustainable

05:32.273 --> 05:34.773
at current levels.

05:34.775 --> 05:36.475
The herd must be thinned.

05:36.477 --> 05:39.078
So you've argued, Mr. Savage,

05:39.080 --> 05:42.314
but no matter how many times
you choose to press your point,

05:42.316 --> 05:45.684
my decision shall stand.

06:14.381 --> 06:16.949
Vandal.

06:16.951 --> 06:18.851
Oh, my boy.

06:18.853 --> 06:20.853
My father would have you
killed for calling me that.

06:20.855 --> 06:23.655
Oh, I wouldn't want to chance execution.

06:23.657 --> 06:26.558
Per Degaton.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.293
So how did the meeting go?

06:28.295 --> 06:31.396
Well, your father was being
his usual intractable self.

06:31.398 --> 06:34.266
The problem is, my young student,

06:34.268 --> 06:36.435
to run a corporation is not the same

06:36.437 --> 06:39.171
as ruling a country.

06:39.173 --> 06:40.906
If you're implying that my father

06:40.908 --> 06:42.574
doesn't have what it takes...

06:42.576 --> 06:46.078
Yes, he would have killed
me for that as well.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.216
Well, I suppose I just have
to live dangerously then.

06:51.218 --> 06:54.153
So how are your studies progressing?

06:57.124 --> 06:58.957
He's a teacher.

06:58.959 --> 07:01.226
Tutor, it would seem, to
young Per Degaton himself.

07:01.228 --> 07:03.896
You say that like it's
supposed to mean something.

07:03.898 --> 07:06.031
After the death of his
father in five year's time,

07:06.033 --> 07:08.100
Per Degaton unleashes
the Armageddon Virus,

07:08.102 --> 07:10.002
which decimates the world's population,

07:10.004 --> 07:12.437
leaving it ripe for conquest.

07:15.376 --> 07:17.709
Per Degaton primes the
world for dictatorship,

07:17.711 --> 07:19.778
and then when the time is right...

07:22.449 --> 07:26.385
Savage snatches that power away from him.

07:26.387 --> 07:28.554
By killing Per Degaton.

07:28.556 --> 07:30.189
Indeed.

07:30.191 --> 07:31.757
Okay, so we don't have what we need

07:31.759 --> 07:33.725
to take out Savage, but
maybe now we can figure out

07:33.727 --> 07:35.227
a way to stop his rise to power.

07:35.229 --> 07:37.529
By depriving him of his
springboard, Per Degaton.

07:37.531 --> 07:41.099
Okay, how do we do that?

07:41.101 --> 07:42.601
It's quite simple, really.

07:42.603 --> 07:46.738
We kill the little bastard ourselves.

07:50.500 --> 07:55.000
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:57.329 --> 08:01.001
To be clear, we're talking
about murdering a child...

08:01.011 --> 08:03.177
Who hasn't done anything to anyone...

08:03.179 --> 08:05.880
Yet, so why don't we pick him off now,

08:05.882 --> 08:06.915
while the picking's easy?

08:07.017 --> 08:08.750
There's got to be a better way.

08:08.752 --> 08:11.052
How do we even know that
this Per Degaton kid's path

08:11.054 --> 08:13.788
to becoming a world-ruling
dictator is inevitable?

08:13.790 --> 08:16.257
Because in the future that I'm from,

08:16.259 --> 08:18.259
children learn about Per
Degaton in the same way

08:18.261 --> 08:21.029
that children in your time
learn about Adolf Hitler.

08:21.031 --> 08:23.465
What about addressing the
larger societal problems

08:23.467 --> 08:25.600
that would allow such a
despot's rise to power?

08:25.602 --> 08:27.302
We already know what pushes this punk

08:27.304 --> 08:29.671
to the dark side: Savage.

08:29.673 --> 08:31.172
Look, it's not the kid's fault

08:31.174 --> 08:32.874
he's got an immortal
psychopath as his tutor.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.808
If we don't kill the kid
now, Savage will as soon

08:34.811 --> 08:38.446
as he's done using him
to take over the world.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.014
If he doesn't build him
into the greatest tyrant

08:40.015 --> 08:41.349
the world has ever known,

08:41.351 --> 08:43.150
Savage can't become the last tyrant

08:43.153 --> 08:45.320
the world will ever know.

08:45.322 --> 08:47.789
Murdering a child in cold blood

08:47.791 --> 08:49.891
just like Savage murdered your own son.

08:49.893 --> 08:51.292
What's the use in saving the world

08:51.294 --> 08:54.229
if we stoop to his methods to do so?

08:57.167 --> 08:58.733
I'm with Professor Stein.

08:58.735 --> 09:00.468
Okay, fine.

09:00.470 --> 09:03.071
If y'all don't have the
guts to kill this kid...

09:03.073 --> 09:04.906
Then removing him from the timeline

09:04.908 --> 09:06.941
might be the next best thing.

09:06.943 --> 09:08.676
Great, we've gone from infanticide

09:08.678 --> 09:11.379
to child abduction. Progress.

09:11.381 --> 09:13.248
First we need to devise how to abduct him

09:13.250 --> 09:15.717
from underneath the noses of
his father's private guard.

09:15.719 --> 09:18.019
And don't forget the army of Atom robots.

09:18.021 --> 09:20.355
We're going to need an accomplished thief.

09:20.357 --> 09:22.090
Well, while you're kidnapping baby Hitler,

09:22.092 --> 09:24.759
Professor Stein and I will
sabotage the robot army.

09:24.761 --> 09:26.227
I call Team Robot Army.

09:26.229 --> 09:27.862
Isn't that a waste of time?

09:27.864 --> 09:29.430
Not for the Kasnian citizens

09:29.432 --> 09:31.166
who are tormented by my technology.

09:31.168 --> 09:33.468
That technology does lead
to Savage's rise to power.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.203
Good backup plan.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.539
Fine, Team Kidnapping.

09:37.541 --> 09:39.507
Go team.

09:44.581 --> 09:46.014
Hey, you okay?

09:46.016 --> 09:49.551
Yeah, yeah, I was just... thinking.

09:49.553 --> 09:52.287
Ah, I think I understand.

09:52.289 --> 09:53.321
You do?

09:53.323 --> 09:54.722
Yeah, Savage.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.892
He's so close you can sense him, right?

09:57.894 --> 10:00.328
Yeah.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.497
Do you want to talk about it?

10:02.499 --> 10:05.166
No. Don't worry about me.

10:05.168 --> 10:06.167
I'll be fine.

10:06.169 --> 10:09.304
Okay.

10:12.475 --> 10:13.708
Honey?

10:16.546 --> 10:19.414
Honey?

10:19.416 --> 10:20.381
I'm home.

10:29.659 --> 10:30.792
What's the matter?

10:30.794 --> 10:32.193
Nothing.

10:32.195 --> 10:34.662
Can I fix you a drink?

10:34.664 --> 10:36.364
That would be lovely.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.466
And while you do, you can
tell me what's on your mind.

10:38.468 --> 10:41.436
Really, it's nothing.

10:41.438 --> 10:43.571
You are a terrible liar.

10:43.573 --> 10:45.340
Yes, but...

10:45.342 --> 10:47.408
you love me anyway.

10:47.410 --> 10:52.113
Beyond anything I can describe.

10:52.115 --> 10:55.583
And because I love you, I know
when something's bothering you.

10:55.585 --> 10:58.886
It's... it's just a feeling.

10:58.888 --> 11:00.722
Of him?

11:00.724 --> 11:03.791
It's hard to tell.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.793
I haven't sensed Savage's presence,

11:05.795 --> 11:08.830
but you do... or you think you do.

11:08.832 --> 11:11.666
I think it's time for us to go.

11:11.668 --> 11:13.534
I have some vacation time coming up.

11:13.536 --> 11:15.370
We can drive to Coast City
and do some sightseeing.

11:15.372 --> 11:17.005
A vacation isn't going to fix this.

11:17.007 --> 11:18.840
I know.

11:18.842 --> 11:21.209
Savage isn't just gonna forget
about us because we went away.

11:21.211 --> 11:22.443
I know.

11:22.445 --> 11:23.478
And he's not gonna stop until...

11:23.480 --> 11:26.414
Mommy?

11:26.416 --> 11:27.782
I can't sleep.

11:27.784 --> 11:28.916
Hey, Slugger.

11:28.918 --> 11:30.752
- Daddy.
- Come here.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.861
What's wrong?

11:39.863 --> 11:43.131
Nothing. Nothing.

11:43.133 --> 11:47.068
I just love you so much.

11:47.070 --> 11:50.004
I love both of you so much.

11:56.479 --> 11:59.247
No litter. No street crime. No smog.

11:59.249 --> 12:01.182
How soon can we leave?

12:01.184 --> 12:03.084
Keep your eyes peeled.

12:03.086 --> 12:04.852
According to Gideon, Per Degaton

12:04.854 --> 12:06.254
should be passing through any minute

12:06.256 --> 12:08.289
on his way to gymnastics class.

12:08.291 --> 12:12.894
Are you telling me future Hitler
is enrolled in a gymnastics class?

12:20.437 --> 12:22.637
Yes.

12:31.047 --> 12:33.247
I got eyes on Little Lord Fauntleroy.

12:33.249 --> 12:35.350
I don't see him.

12:35.352 --> 12:37.819
It's because he's surrounded
by Daddy's goon squad.

12:37.821 --> 12:41.656
Northeast corner of the plaza.

12:41.658 --> 12:43.324
Got him.

12:43.326 --> 12:45.126
You sure you don't want to just shoot him?

12:45.128 --> 12:46.627
It'd be a whole lot easier.

12:46.629 --> 12:49.864
Stick to the plan, both of you.

12:52.335 --> 12:53.634
Now, Ms. Lance.

12:57.941 --> 12:59.841
I'm in position.

12:59.843 --> 13:02.377
It's up to you now, Mr. Snart.

13:14.225 --> 13:16.793
Since the introduction of our latest line

13:16.795 --> 13:18.494
of autonomous law enforcement officers,

13:18.496 --> 13:21.331
crime has dropped precipitously.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.532
In fact, it's nonexistent.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.067
Really?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.536
Well, thank you for showing
us around, Dr. Brice.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.071
It's my pleasure.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.340
We don't get very many
visitors from Central City

13:30.342 --> 13:33.776
ever since the S.T.A.R. Labs
Corporation took it over.

13:36.614 --> 13:37.947
Uh, unless I'm mistaken,

13:37.949 --> 13:40.516
your tech utilizes a dwarf star alloy.

13:40.518 --> 13:44.754
The technology is proprietary, but yes.

13:44.756 --> 13:46.556
How did you know, Doctor...

13:46.558 --> 13:48.157
Lecter...

13:48.159 --> 13:50.626
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

13:50.628 --> 13:55.965
So how did you get into
robotics, Dr. Brice?

13:55.967 --> 13:58.034
Oh, well, it's in my blood.

13:58.036 --> 14:00.603
Robotics have been a passion of my family

14:00.605 --> 14:02.372
ever since my great-great-great-great

14:02.374 --> 14:05.174
grandfather founded this company.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.013
Is that...

14:11.015 --> 14:13.449
Oh, my God.

14:16.588 --> 14:18.488
Huh, weird.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.789
You look just like him.

14:19.791 --> 14:23.126
Yes, I... I look just like...

14:23.128 --> 14:26.996
yeah, that's... that's pretty weird.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.523
I can't believe it.

14:31.525 --> 14:33.515
I'm like the Werner Von Braun of robots.

14:33.626 --> 14:34.426
The who?

14:34.428 --> 14:36.761
The Nazi scientist who
invented the V2 rocket,

14:36.763 --> 14:39.864
built it using slave labor,
then used it to level London.

14:39.956 --> 14:41.572
Except my robots will one day be used

14:41.581 --> 14:43.180
to level the entire world.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.815
Ray, dude, do you not think

14:44.817 --> 14:46.884
you're focusing on the wrong thing here?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.719
I mean, you have a kid
you didn't even know about.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.055
Had a kid. In this particular time period,

14:51.057 --> 14:53.190
his offspring would be long since dead.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.825
Thank you,

14:54.827 --> 14:56.994
as if I wasn't already feeling bad enough.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.263
How is it even possible that I'm someone's

14:59.265 --> 15:02.099
great-great-great-great grandfather?

15:02.101 --> 15:06.671
Before we left in 2016,
the only person I was...

15:06.673 --> 15:08.472
Having sex with?

15:08.474 --> 15:11.409
Ghosted me the week before we left.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.743
Sh... she died?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.112
No, no, ghosting.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.480
It's where you pretend to be dead

15:16.482 --> 15:18.282
by not answering somebody's text.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.451
What a strange age for dating.

15:20.453 --> 15:25.189
You think maybe she didn't
reply to your text because...

15:25.191 --> 15:27.525
She knew she was pregnant?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.294
No wonder my kid started the company

15:30.296 --> 15:31.962
that manufactures evil robots.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.464
If I'd never left 2016,

15:33.466 --> 15:34.899
my child would have had a loving father,

15:34.901 --> 15:36.834
and Palmer Tech might not have gone on

15:36.836 --> 15:38.803
to build a robot army that Savage uses

15:38.805 --> 15:40.805
to conquer the world.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.907
Bit of a stretch, don't you think?

15:42.909 --> 15:47.244
Either way, I was someone's father

15:47.246 --> 15:50.581
and didn't even know it.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.521
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.190
Are you okay?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.726
Fine. Oh, I'm fine.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.161
You don't look fine.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.831
I'm just a little... peckish.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.466
Peckish?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.502
It's nothing a little
energy bar won't fix.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.672
I'll see you.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.216
Edith and Joseph Boardman?

16:25.218 --> 16:27.051
Our new names.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.187
Joe Boardman is a good name.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.957
And besides, I've never
kissed an Edith before,

16:32.959 --> 16:36.026
but I certainly think
I can get used to that.

16:38.364 --> 16:43.100
And what about all this?

16:43.102 --> 16:45.669
How do we explain to our son

16:45.671 --> 16:49.507
why his mother and father keep
moving every couple of years,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.041
changing their names,

16:51.043 --> 16:53.210
looking over their
shoulders at every turn?

16:53.212 --> 16:57.548
I don't know why we thought
we could do this again.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.284
Do you think we're selfish?

17:00.286 --> 17:01.485
To have a family?

17:01.487 --> 17:02.987
Because when Savage finds us...

17:02.989 --> 17:05.455
- He won't.
- He always finds us.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.391
Maybe this life is different.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.060
Do you honestly believe that?

17:11.897 --> 17:15.532
Look...

17:15.535 --> 17:19.502
all I know is that Savage
is not the only thing

17:19.505 --> 17:22.640
that's immortal, my love.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.377
So is this.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.423
What do genocidal maniacs
dream about, I wonder?

17:39.425 --> 17:42.560
He's imagining himself baking
cookies with his mother.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.130
Wait, you can monitor our dreams?

17:46.132 --> 17:48.098
Of course. For example, last night,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.667
you had a rollicking fantasy
involving a young nurse...

17:49.669 --> 17:51.869
Okay, Gideon, enough.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.238
Gideon, check the timeline to make sure

17:54.240 --> 17:55.539
that the kidnapping of the boy

17:55.541 --> 17:58.075
had the desired effect upon the future.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.977
Oh, dear.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.214
I'm afraid you'll be
disappointed with the results.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.615
What do you mean, it did nothing?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.450
I mean, that kidnapping Per Degaton

18:06.452 --> 18:08.285
had a nominal effect upon the timeline.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.621
Maybe we need to dump the little brat

18:10.623 --> 18:12.890
somewhere he can't get into any trouble,

18:12.892 --> 18:14.658
like the Stone Age.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.393
No matter where and when you sequester him

18:16.395 --> 18:18.796
in the timeline, Savage
will still rise to power.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.532
But Rip said this kid's
like a baby Hitler.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.467
Yes, I also said that
time wants to happen,

18:23.469 --> 18:27.104
and such a world-changing event
like Savage's rise to power

18:27.106 --> 18:30.841
can't be stopped merely by
kidnapping his young pawn.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.142
So we're back to plan A?

18:32.144 --> 18:34.178
Snuffing the kid out in his sleep?

18:34.180 --> 18:38.048
Let us not forget that
this kid will one day

18:38.050 --> 18:42.152
be responsible for billions of deaths,

18:42.154 --> 18:44.188
including those of my family.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.923
Say that you do stop Savage

18:45.925 --> 18:47.491
and save the lives of your family.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.126
Will you be able to look
your own son in the eye

18:49.128 --> 18:51.896
knowing what you did so he could live?

18:51.898 --> 18:55.366
When the alternative is that
I shall never see him again.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.101
I got a better idea.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.669
Instead of us arguing about
whether we should kill him,

18:58.671 --> 19:00.838
or where and when to dump him off,

19:00.840 --> 19:02.306
why don't we just talk to him?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.341
Savage has spent years
corrupting his mind.

19:04.343 --> 19:07.511
It's not too late for
Per Degaton to change.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.712
Says who?

19:08.714 --> 19:10.714
Says someone with two tours

19:10.716 --> 19:12.416
with the League of Assassins and a case

19:12.418 --> 19:15.386
of bloodlust under her belt.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.928
Ah, finally,

19:23.930 --> 19:27.498
someone who's willing to do a man's job.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.333
Not why I'm here.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.601
It's almost funny

19:30.603 --> 19:32.469
how you guys keep parading in here

19:32.471 --> 19:35.506
like it's some kind of
confessional or something.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.875
It's also not why I'm here.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.145
Okay, I'll bite.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.681
Everybody's out there arguing about

19:43.683 --> 19:45.015
whether or not we should kill this kid,

19:45.017 --> 19:48.152
'cause no one thinks he can change,

19:48.154 --> 19:51.121
which made me think of you.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.061
You know no one thinks you can change.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.896
That's why you're in here.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.532
The only reason I'm in
here is if I get out,

20:01.534 --> 20:02.933
I'm gonna give Snart some payback

20:02.935 --> 20:04.268
he's not walking away from.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.769
He saved your life.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.172
He wussed out on killing
me, not the same thing.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.673
He marooned me.

20:09.675 --> 20:13.410
It's not like he had many choices.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.212
You know, while you were busy

20:15.214 --> 20:18.048
selling us out to a homicidal time pirate,

20:18.050 --> 20:21.285
Leonard and I almost died.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.455
He was thinking about you,

20:24.457 --> 20:29.293
told me about your
partnership, your friendship.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.428
Di it make you weepy?

20:33.032 --> 20:35.633
You think it's gonna make me weepy?

20:35.635 --> 20:39.470
He's your friend, a loyal one.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.940
You should know that.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.409
Well, thank you.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.146
I'll work it out with
him as soon as I can.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.951
Oh, killing a kid,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.820
not very hero-like.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.642
Mr. Degaton.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.812
For the last 50 years,
everyone inside the Conglomerate

21:21.814 --> 21:23.414
has submitted biosamples

21:23.416 --> 21:26.016
so they can be tracked
and monitored at all times,

21:26.018 --> 21:27.051
but these three...

21:27.053 --> 21:29.053
Are not from the Conglomerate,

21:29.055 --> 21:31.689
nor are they even from the last 50 years.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.756
How do you know?

21:32.758 --> 21:34.825
Long story.

21:34.827 --> 21:38.462
What's important is that
I can get your son back.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.497
How do you know they
haven't killed him already?

21:40.499 --> 21:42.866
Because I know the
people who kidnapped him,

21:42.868 --> 21:46.003
and they are weak...

21:46.005 --> 21:48.839
squeamish in matters of death.

22:28.816 --> 22:30.315
Who are you?

22:32.186 --> 22:34.820
That's an excellent question.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.323
What was that?

22:38.325 --> 22:39.892
That was our jump ship taking off.

22:39.894 --> 22:41.427
How could Per Degaton have escaped?

22:41.429 --> 22:43.228
Gideon, who else is on the jump ship?

22:43.230 --> 22:45.698
It's being piloted by Captain Hunter.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.666
Who just turned off his transponder.

22:47.668 --> 22:50.402
Sounds like someone doesn't
want us following him.

22:50.404 --> 22:52.004
Why?

22:52.006 --> 22:54.339
Because Rip doesn't want us stopping him.

22:54.341 --> 22:57.609
Stopping him from doing what?

22:57.611 --> 23:00.412
From killing Per Degaton.

23:03.678 --> 23:05.591
Okay, just think about this.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.994
Where could Rip be taking Per Degaton?

23:08.996 --> 23:12.531
Jump ship's got a range of
8,000 miles, so... anywhere.

23:12.533 --> 23:14.766
It doesn't matter where he's taking him.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.835
All that matters is
what he's gonna do to him

23:16.837 --> 23:19.038
- when he gets there.
- Rip is not a murderer.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.772
To Captain Hunter, this
isn't about a killing.

23:20.774 --> 23:24.142
- It's about saving.
- Saving?

23:24.144 --> 23:29.414
His son's life for Per Degaton's.

23:29.416 --> 23:32.784
Rather simple if cold-blooded calculus

23:32.786 --> 23:34.853
for a father to undertake.

23:37.391 --> 23:40.225
Do you know who I am?

23:40.227 --> 23:41.693
My father is going to...

23:41.695 --> 23:43.729
Thank me?

23:43.731 --> 23:45.330
I imagine there's a sizeable reward

23:45.332 --> 23:47.065
for your safe return.

23:47.067 --> 23:50.068
Relax.

23:50.070 --> 23:52.337
You'll soon be home.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.479
Come on, honey, we got to get moving

24:00.481 --> 24:02.948
or the train is going to leave without us.

24:02.950 --> 24:04.316
Where are we going?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.184
We are going on a little trip.

24:06.186 --> 24:09.221
Just think of it as
one of your adventures.

24:09.223 --> 24:10.923
The bad man found us,

24:10.925 --> 24:14.259
the one that you and Mommy
talk about when I'm asleep?

24:16.931 --> 24:19.431
Why is Vandal Savage chasing us?

24:21.835 --> 24:24.202
It's time that he knew.

24:26.807 --> 24:28.440
Come on.

24:33.213 --> 24:35.314
Can you keep a secret, Aldus?

24:35.316 --> 24:40.319
There's something... special
about your mommy and daddy.

24:40.321 --> 24:43.221
We've known each other
for a very, very long time

24:43.223 --> 24:45.857
and loved one another
since the day we met.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.926
I already know that story.

24:48.929 --> 24:52.564
You know part of that story.

24:52.566 --> 24:55.934
Have you ever heard of
a place called Egypt?

24:55.936 --> 24:59.972
Well, it all began during
the rule of Ramses II,

24:59.974 --> 25:01.974
when late one night a big, magical meteor

25:01.976 --> 25:07.012
smashed into the Temple
of Horus, the hawk-god.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.854
- Hey, you okay?
- Hey.

25:15.856 --> 25:18.957
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:18.959 --> 25:20.892
I was just thinking.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.461
What are you thinking about?

25:22.463 --> 25:25.330
Let me into that
4,000-year-old mind of yours.

25:27.234 --> 25:31.336
The flashes I've been
having, they aren't of Savage.

25:31.338 --> 25:35.440
They're of Carter.

25:35.442 --> 25:38.377
- Oh.
- And they're not just memories.

25:38.379 --> 25:40.379
They're feelings too.

25:40.381 --> 25:42.881
Oh, well, I get that.

25:42.883 --> 25:44.783
It must be really weird feeling like

25:44.785 --> 25:47.552
you're cheating on me with him.

25:47.554 --> 25:49.654
No, Ray.

25:49.656 --> 25:54.159
I feel like I'm cheating on him with you.

25:57.231 --> 25:58.864
I'm sorry.

26:00.234 --> 26:02.234
No, it's... it's okay.

26:04.471 --> 26:07.372
I mean, I knew what I was getting into.

26:07.374 --> 26:10.208
The last 206 times you fell in love,

26:10.210 --> 26:12.444
it was with the same guy.

26:12.446 --> 26:16.148
I guess this isn't a
great time to talk about

26:16.150 --> 26:18.283
what's been bothering you.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.651
Ah, uh...

26:19.653 --> 26:22.888
You're not the only perceptive one.

26:24.691 --> 26:27.092
So what's wrong?

26:28.529 --> 26:32.931
Turns out that I had a
child I didn't know about

26:32.933 --> 26:36.735
back in 2016, and here in the future,

26:36.737 --> 26:39.538
my great-great-great-great granddaughter

26:39.540 --> 26:41.540
creates the army of robot Gestapos

26:41.542 --> 26:46.711
that Savage will one day
use to destroy the world.

26:48.415 --> 26:50.015
Why didn't you tell me?

26:52.119 --> 26:55.053
I didn't want you to think less of me.

26:55.055 --> 27:00.058
Ray, how could I ever think less of you?

27:01.795 --> 27:04.963
Well, now that we've got
that off our chests...

27:04.965 --> 27:08.133
What does that mean for us?

27:12.639 --> 27:15.307
No luck finding our homicidal captain?

27:15.309 --> 27:16.741
Gideon's still searching,

27:16.743 --> 27:18.743
but I have a feeling
Rip's not gonna be found

27:18.745 --> 27:19.978
if he doesn't want to be.

27:19.980 --> 27:22.080
So what are you doing down here?

27:22.082 --> 27:25.050
Don't you think you at
least owe him a conversation?

27:25.052 --> 27:28.320
We had our conversation
while he was Chronos,

27:28.322 --> 27:31.189
and he made his feelings
about me very clear.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.791
And what about your feelings?

27:32.793 --> 27:34.559
About you?

27:34.561 --> 27:36.027
About Mick.

27:36.029 --> 27:40.365
I don't have any feelings about Mick.

27:42.336 --> 27:44.336
Look, it didn't seem that way

27:44.338 --> 27:47.405
when we were dying in the
engine room of hypothermia.

27:47.407 --> 27:50.008
Look, if you want to ease
your guilty conscience,

27:50.010 --> 27:51.743
that's your business,

27:51.745 --> 27:53.378
but he's still the same
son of a bitch he was

27:53.380 --> 27:55.547
when you all wanted me to put him down.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.949
I wasn't the one who
mentioned marooning Rory.

27:57.951 --> 27:59.584
You did.

27:59.586 --> 28:03.088
It's obviously still
weighing on your conscience.

28:03.090 --> 28:08.560
So stop being an ass and go deal with it.

28:19.640 --> 28:22.107
This isn't Kasnia.

28:22.109 --> 28:25.076
I thought a neutral site
would be best for this.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.412
For what?

28:27.414 --> 28:29.748
Exchanging me?

28:29.750 --> 28:33.518
Did your father ever teach
you to swim, Per Degaton?

28:33.520 --> 28:36.655
No, I imagine he had someone
do it for him, didn't he?

28:36.657 --> 28:40.525
You're hardly lacking
in tutors, are you...

28:40.527 --> 28:44.763
such as Mr. Savage.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.298
What are you talking about?

28:46.300 --> 28:49.401
My son Jonas always
wanted to learn to swim.

28:49.403 --> 28:51.436
I promised him that I'd teach him,

28:51.438 --> 28:56.541
but there never seemed to be... time.

28:58.178 --> 29:01.479
My son never learned to swim,

29:01.481 --> 29:04.015
because he was killed.

29:04.017 --> 29:07.485
So... you brought me here to kill me.

29:07.487 --> 29:10.755
I brought you here to save my son's life,

29:10.757 --> 29:13.124
your life in exchange for his.

29:16.763 --> 29:18.263
I'm sorry.

29:18.265 --> 29:21.566
No you're not.

29:21.568 --> 29:23.101
You're not sorry,

29:23.103 --> 29:24.736
because you're not going to kill me.

29:24.738 --> 29:26.037
I have to.

29:26.039 --> 29:29.107
To save my wife and son, I have to.

29:29.109 --> 29:31.009
I don't expect you to understand.

29:31.011 --> 29:32.877
It doesn't matter if I understand.

29:32.879 --> 29:34.579
I can see it in your eyes.

29:34.581 --> 29:36.081
You're not going to do it.

29:36.083 --> 29:40.585
You're like my father, weak.

29:42.522 --> 29:45.023
Vandal Savage has taught me many things,

29:45.025 --> 29:49.060
including what a killer looks like.

29:49.062 --> 29:52.931
You're not a killer.

30:00.641 --> 30:03.942
Your tutor has taught you well,

30:03.944 --> 30:05.577
despite his ill intentions.

30:05.579 --> 30:06.878
Vandal loves me.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.247
Oh, he wants to use you as his pawn,

30:09.249 --> 30:12.517
and ultimately, he will betray you.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.019
No. No, he wouldn't.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.587
I've said to myself time and time again

30:15.589 --> 30:17.422
that there is nothing that I wouldn't do

30:17.424 --> 30:20.625
to save my wife and son,
but now I know that there is.

30:20.627 --> 30:22.994
My reticence to kill you, Per Degaton,

30:22.996 --> 30:25.397
is not weakness.

30:25.399 --> 30:27.832
It is goodness.

30:27.834 --> 30:30.168
And if there is a shred
of goodness inside of me,

30:30.170 --> 30:31.903
then I have to believe
that there is a shred

30:31.905 --> 30:34.272
of goodness inside of you.

30:37.311 --> 30:41.713
Be the man that your
father wants you to be,

30:41.715 --> 30:45.283
not the man Savage wants you to be.

31:02.168 --> 31:04.769
Savage, he's coming.

31:05.805 --> 31:06.372
Gideon?

31:06.574 --> 31:08.814
Tor Degaton's forces
have surrounded the ship.

31:16.049 --> 31:18.115
I'm afraid our shields
will not be able to sustain

31:18.117 --> 31:19.550
continued bombardment.

31:19.552 --> 31:20.952
You're afraid?

31:20.974 --> 31:22.173
Here's an idea: why don't you fire back?

31:22.175 --> 31:23.941
I would, except...

31:23.943 --> 31:25.843
The flying robots already
targeted our weapons systems.

31:25.845 --> 31:27.545
We don't need weapons.

31:27.547 --> 31:29.947
He's right. We have super powers.

31:44.230 --> 31:46.664
I think this is yours.

31:56.343 --> 32:00.011
I'll draw their fire. You
handle the ground troops.

32:00.013 --> 32:01.913
Aah!

32:22.335 --> 32:23.835
Ugh!

32:28.375 --> 32:30.708
Ray, are you all right?

32:30.710 --> 32:32.910
So this is what it feels
like to be last year's model.

32:32.912 --> 32:35.947
They're too fast. We
have to find another way.

32:39.285 --> 32:41.886
Forget about them. We'll
hold off the robots.

32:41.888 --> 32:44.288
We'll take out their command center.

32:58.972 --> 33:00.671
Who are you?

33:00.673 --> 33:02.273
Yeah.

33:04.711 --> 33:06.377
Ray, hurry up.

33:06.379 --> 33:08.980
I can only hold them back for so long.

33:12.118 --> 33:14.819
Where did you get your suit?

33:14.821 --> 33:17.321
Look, if you don't let us disable

33:17.323 --> 33:18.656
your evil robot army,

33:18.658 --> 33:20.625
then the whole world will be destroyed.

33:20.627 --> 33:24.462
They're designed to bring peace.

33:24.464 --> 33:26.464
I know.

33:26.466 --> 33:27.799
I designed the robots.

33:27.801 --> 33:29.066
What?

33:29.068 --> 33:32.236
I am your great-great-great-great

33:32.238 --> 33:34.172
grandfather, the guy you have a bust of

33:34.174 --> 33:38.543
in your lobby, father
of the robotics industry.

33:38.545 --> 33:41.179
You're trying to tell me
that you're Sidney Palmer?

33:41.181 --> 33:43.748
Sidney?

33:43.750 --> 33:49.353
Wait, the bust in your lobby
is of my stupid brother?

33:49.355 --> 33:50.988
Of course.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.323
He must have gone to work for Felicity

33:52.325 --> 33:54.358
in 2016 after I vanished.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.660
He allowed my tech to be perverted

33:55.662 --> 33:58.596
by the defense industry.
That is so Sidney.

33:58.598 --> 34:02.500
So that means that she's not...

34:02.502 --> 34:04.702
I'm not a father.

34:06.506 --> 34:09.706
So we still need your
help disabling the robots.

34:11.744 --> 34:14.612
A... and why should I believe you?

34:14.614 --> 34:17.281
Because if you have even
a drop of Palmer blood

34:17.283 --> 34:20.418
in your veins, you'll do what's right.

34:33.616 --> 34:36.617
Looks like Raymond was able
to sabotage his robot army.

34:36.619 --> 34:38.286
Which means mopping up
the rest of these guys

34:38.288 --> 34:39.887
shouldn't be a problem.

34:39.889 --> 34:41.822
Oh, it will be a problem.

34:43.092 --> 34:44.559
What do you want?

34:44.561 --> 34:46.027
I want to exchange this woman's life

34:46.029 --> 34:48.929
for your captain, Rip Hunter.

34:48.931 --> 34:51.197
I have a better idea:

34:51.199 --> 34:54.635
her life in exchange for his.

34:57.777 --> 34:59.410
Your son will be returned to you

34:59.412 --> 35:02.213
as soon as you guarantee our safe passage.

35:02.215 --> 35:04.048
Don't do it, Father.

35:04.050 --> 35:05.449
If you let them go now,

35:05.451 --> 35:08.552
they will only come back
for us in the future.

35:08.554 --> 35:09.787
It's your choice.

35:12.725 --> 35:14.191
Your son is right.

35:14.193 --> 35:17.294
We should kill them all.

35:19.032 --> 35:20.598
Put down your weapons!

35:20.600 --> 35:23.000
- No, Father.
- Let my son go,

35:23.002 --> 35:25.236
and I will let you leave in peace.

35:25.238 --> 35:27.638
You have my word.

35:38.618 --> 35:43.421
Better find yourself a new mentor, kid.

36:10.186 --> 36:11.919
What do you want?

36:11.921 --> 36:14.054
People seem to think we
should have a heart-to-heart.

36:14.056 --> 36:16.557
We don't have hearts.
Where does that leave us?

36:16.559 --> 36:18.325
I've got a dozen reasons for killing you.

36:18.327 --> 36:21.128
You've got a dozen and
one for killing me, so...

36:21.130 --> 36:23.964
All the talk in the world
is not gonna change a thing.

36:23.966 --> 36:26.100
Exactly, here's my proposal.

36:26.102 --> 36:30.137
I open this cell, we let
our fists do the talking.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.547
When I kill you...

36:39.549 --> 36:41.816
You take the jump ship, make your escape,

36:41.818 --> 36:45.653
live out the rest of your
life anywhere you like.

36:47.089 --> 36:48.556
Hmm.

36:48.558 --> 36:52.760
And if you kill me, well,

36:52.762 --> 36:54.995
it's better than being
locked up in this place

36:54.997 --> 36:58.566
like some kind of circus freak.

36:58.568 --> 37:00.000
I take that as a yes.

37:00.002 --> 37:02.403
Sound the bell.

37:06.512 --> 37:08.012
Hey.

37:08.014 --> 37:09.446
You don't have to knock.

37:09.448 --> 37:11.649
- It's your room too.
- Yeah, I know.

37:11.651 --> 37:15.819
It's just... things have been weird.

37:15.821 --> 37:19.056
Since I told you I had a love child

37:19.058 --> 37:20.658
that I didn't really have,

37:20.660 --> 37:22.593
or since you told me that
you're still in love with...

37:22.595 --> 37:26.163
You know what I love about you, Ray, is,

37:26.165 --> 37:28.933
you always manage to find the bright side.

37:28.935 --> 37:31.168
And no matter what, you never give up.

37:31.170 --> 37:35.072
So please, don't give up on us.

37:35.074 --> 37:37.541
I'm not giving up,

37:37.543 --> 37:40.511
but it's hard to ignore the math.

37:40.513 --> 37:42.947
You and Carter have
spent lifetimes together,

37:42.949 --> 37:47.217
and in each one, you've fallen in love,

37:47.219 --> 37:49.887
so why would this
lifetime be any different?

37:51.490 --> 37:56.293
Well, I never met you before.

37:57.530 --> 38:02.066
Look, Ray, Carter is my past.

38:02.068 --> 38:06.003
You are my future.

38:19.318 --> 38:21.018
Vandal.

38:21.020 --> 38:23.854
Oh, I didn't expect you
up and about so soon.

38:23.856 --> 38:25.289
My father wanted me to rest,

38:25.291 --> 38:27.591
but I wanted to resume my studies.

38:27.593 --> 38:29.059
Oh, good boy.

38:29.061 --> 38:30.961
So... where should we begin?

38:30.963 --> 38:34.031
Well, I was thinking Greek mythology.

38:34.033 --> 38:36.333
Do you know the tale of Oedipus Rex?

38:36.335 --> 38:40.504
He was a prince of thieves
before his father exiled him.

38:40.506 --> 38:41.772
Why?

38:41.774 --> 38:45.275
Well, because the king was a coward.

38:45.277 --> 38:47.711
He had heard a prophecy
that one day his son

38:47.713 --> 38:51.615
would take his crown, so
he bound his boy's feet

38:51.617 --> 38:56.286
and tossed him into the woods to die.

38:56.288 --> 38:57.688
What did the boy do?

38:57.690 --> 38:59.957
He did what he had to do.

38:59.959 --> 39:02.226
And one day, the prophecy came true,

39:02.228 --> 39:06.764
and the prince became a
great and powerful king.

39:09.468 --> 39:11.835
Though it wasn't easy.

39:11.837 --> 39:14.605
Great things are never easy.

39:24.383 --> 39:26.717
Unfortunately, our
interactions have done nothing

39:26.719 --> 39:30.888
to halt Per Degaton's rise to power.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.924
If anything, we've merely cemented it.

39:38.597 --> 39:40.597
In fact, the virus, which
wasn't supposed to be

39:40.599 --> 39:43.000
unleashed upon the world
for another five years...

39:43.002 --> 39:45.235
I'm sorry, Father.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.642
Will now be released in a matter of days.

39:52.344 --> 39:54.611
As you all know, our
former chairman's chair

39:54.613 --> 39:58.115
is in the Conglomerate passed to his son,

39:58.117 --> 40:02.219
who due to his age elected
me to act as his proxy.

40:06.261 --> 40:07.594
First order of business,

40:07.596 --> 40:10.396
I would like to revisit our discussion

40:10.398 --> 40:12.398
concerning the population crisis

40:12.400 --> 40:14.367
beyond the Conglomerate's borders.

40:14.369 --> 40:18.938
As we all know, we
already have a solution.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.241
Did I do the right thing, Gideon?

40:21.243 --> 40:23.576
Not committing murder
is generally considered

40:23.578 --> 40:26.980
the right thing, Captain.

40:26.982 --> 40:31.484
In this instance...

40:31.486 --> 40:33.987
I wonder.

40:53.675 --> 40:56.142
We had a deal, Mick.

40:56.144 --> 40:59.812
Kill me and you walk.

40:59.814 --> 41:02.815
It's what you wanted, isn't it,

41:02.817 --> 41:06.152
to get off the team?

41:06.154 --> 41:09.022
I don't know what I want anymore.

41:09.024 --> 41:11.958
Truth is, it doesn't matter.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.894
What are you talking about?

41:14.896 --> 41:19.699
Whether I stay or leave, I'm dead.

41:19.701 --> 41:23.036
We're all dead.

41:23.038 --> 41:24.837
Since I failed to bring you in,

41:24.839 --> 41:27.340
the Time Master's want to bring me in,

41:27.342 --> 41:31.311
and this time, they're
not gonna take any chances.

41:31.313 --> 41:34.881
They're called the Hunters, mercenaries,

41:34.883 --> 41:38.117
and unlike me, there isn't
a human part left in them.

41:38.119 --> 41:40.587
So they want to lock us all
up in the Vanishing Point?

41:40.589 --> 41:42.222
The Hunters do one thing:

41:42.224 --> 41:43.256
kill,

41:43.258 --> 41:45.258
whenever, wherever,

41:45.260 --> 41:47.260
and they'll stop at nothing
till every single one of us

41:47.262 --> 41:49.862
is erased from the face of history.

41:52.067 --> 41:54.067
Do you have any suggestions
as to how we might

41:54.069 --> 41:56.236
outsmart them, Mr. Rory?

41:56.238 --> 41:58.404
Run.
