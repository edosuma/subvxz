00:40.000 --> 00:44.400
<i> I'm That Franck Amory. Pretty in pictures but less real. </i>

00:44.700 --> 00:47.800
<i> I work at Publisher Schaudel, who spends a lot of comics. </i>

00:48.100 --> 00:51.400
<i> As a child I was fond of drawing and especially manga. </i>

00:51.700 --> 00:54.200
<i> The two next to me are my best friends. </i>

00:54.400 --> 00:57.200
<i> We are all changed ... Yet almost all of them. </i>

00:57.400 --> 01:00.300
<i> The guy with the Ray-Ban is Sam. </i>

01:00.700 --> 01:02.200
<i> He works at Manpower. Since he works </i>

01:02.600 --> 01:07.000
<i> the number of female workers has increased from 32 to 80%. </i>

01:07.300 --> 01:11.000
<i> This is Alex, the nicest guy I know, but also the weirdest. </i>

01:11.200 --> 01:14.000
<i> He works as a courier, to the chagrin of his boss. </i>

01:14.100 --> 01:16.200
<i> He loves speed and Fast and Furious. </i>

01:16.500 --> 01:18.100
<i> Today is June 25. </i>

01:18.300 --> 01:21.800
<i> A special day for me because it's my birthday. </i>

01:32.300 --> 01:35.900
<i> Happy birthday, Franck. Kisses. </i>

01:37.200 --> 01:40.400
<i> Day Sonia. Thanks. See you soon, I hope. </i>

01:53.500 --> 01:55.300
Happy birthday.

01:55.500 --> 01:59.100
Thanks, buddy. That's sweet. - Please.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.700
Just kidding. It is a package for Aurelie Goudart.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.700
Look what I found in the van.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.200
Should you deliver anywhere? - As long as he does not claim it ...

02:11.300 --> 02:13.100
Fantastic, eh.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.800
And such a great zoom.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.100
I'll see you, fatso.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.100
What a fat guy. - I have to go.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.100
See you for the groceries. Day.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.300
That's like me. This guy takes me to his home.

02:29.700 --> 02:33.500
He starts to fuck me. But then his girlfriend inside

02:33.900 --> 02:36.600
while we are doing. You would not do that.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.400
She's gonna freak out, "You fucked my friend."

02:41.700 --> 02:45.400
I said, "Wait a minute, I fuck him, so he is my love."

02:45.600 --> 02:48.800
And you know what she said? "What is your problem?"

02:49.000 --> 02:52.400
I say ". Nothing What is your problem?" And when she held her tongue.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.300
I fuck him, that's all.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.700
Estelle, I ... - I fuck him, he fucks me, nothing more.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.500
Wait, Mom. What?

03:02.900 --> 03:06.000
I have to see the boss. - Why?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.300
Hope for a better life. - Hurry.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.300
I'm going to do everything alone.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.800
Sorry, what did you say?

03:19.100 --> 03:20.800
What floor are you going?

03:29.900 --> 03:31.400
<i> Is that Scream 4? </i>

03:32.000 --> 03:35.400
And then? If you have no friends, go on Facebook.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.800
What are you gawking at me like that? I'm not your sweetheart.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
Get out of here.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.700
Imbecile.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.900
Sidney's cousin is the killer.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.500
Goodbye, pus.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.700
The rear is cut reason. A lousy courier.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.000
Not really? On the contrary. I do not want to arrive in a wreck.

04:19.300 --> 04:23.400
At one time we both have a break I want to take advantage of the convertible.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.300
I have to show. Kiss.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.700
What are you doing here? Are you new?

04:30.100 --> 04:33.700
I've been working for two years at the reception. I'm Franck Amory.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.200
What are you doing in my office?

04:37.400 --> 04:41.100
I draw comics. I work here and hope I can show my drawings.

04:41.300 --> 04:45.000
And today I thought, "I'm just going to ask and" ...

04:45.800 --> 04:48.000
Thank you for calling me back.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.200
ASAP.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.300
Why, a week? It's just a mirror.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.900
But it just depends what loose.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.200
I come to you, I'll be there in five minutes.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.300
Mr. Schaudel?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.900
Do a squirrel after.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.500
And now a dinosaur. - No.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.600
Come on. One million views on YouTube, you get money.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.100
Your grandmother is a prehistoric animal.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.300
Come on, Sam, please. - Stop it.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.900
My camera, now look.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.300
Boys, so much alcohol?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.600
You are 30. You want us to buy Kidibul?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.200
But so much.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.400
Laure comes. That there are already 33 - 33?

05:41.600 --> 05:46.400
Who all? - Sandrine, Laure, Lucie, Claire ...

05:46.600 --> 05:49.500
Who? I know of no one. - That's nothing. They are handsome chicks.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.700
Especially Lucie, new on the job, with huge boobs.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
She is married, but we forgive her.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.300
Are there any chicks you do not like handsome? - Yes, your exes.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.600
That is not love for your mother.

06:03.300 --> 06:07.100
This is not for my birthday. You organize this party for you.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.700
Well, if not confirm your friends ...

06:09.000 --> 06:13.300
Who has not confirmed? - Sébastien, Sylvain, Sonia Lamar ...

06:13.500 --> 06:15.300
Sonia Lamar, who does not.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.100
Who is that? - My ex.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.500
She also worked at Schaudel. Now she sells cupcakes.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.400
I do not know her. When was that?

06:22.600 --> 06:24.700
Last year, on her farewell drink.

06:24.900 --> 06:28.100
<i> She kissed me on I Want You Back by The Jackson 5. </i>

06:28.400 --> 06:29.900
His long you been together?

06:30.300 --> 06:32.800
Yes and no ... - When did you see her last?

06:33.300 --> 06:34.400
At her farewell drink.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.700
That was quite a relationship. - Many plans made sure?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.100
Just stop. I gotta get back to work.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.300
And do not laugh, you. You must pay for your chicks.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.200
That again is not love for his mother.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.300
<i> Hi, honey. Everything good? - Yes </i>.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
<i> The babysitter was attacked in the subway. </i>

07:05.800 --> 07:08.500
<i> That's terrible. - Yes, they can not come three weeks, </i>.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.500
No, I mean for us. Who is the little fit?

07:11.800 --> 07:14.300
<i> If you go alone, I watch out Remi. </i>

07:14.800 --> 07:17.100
But it is the night of the publishers.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.000
Everyone comes with his partner. What about me?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.600
I'll find a solution. Big kiss.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.200
My best Franáois, that's good.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.000
Franck. - Also good. Do you have plans tonight?

07:33.800 --> 07:36.700
Yes. - Okay, you come watch my son.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.600
That is difficult. My birthday and ... - Franáois.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.100
Would you like me Monday show your drawings?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.200
Yes, but ... - Perfect.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.000
19 hours, Rue de la ferme 7 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.100
We have everything in the house, but what could I say?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.300
This opportunity I can not pass up.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.400
Besides, can you bring me? - Where is it?

07:59.600 --> 08:02.200
Rue de la ferme 7 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.400
Forget about it. I do not have my passport. - Is it so far?

08:39.300 --> 08:42.800
<i> Yeah, who's there? - Hello, I'm babysitting </i>.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.900
Franáois day. - Franck.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.000
Sorry, Franck. I'm Claire.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.300
Thank you for coming fit Rami.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.500
You're welcome.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.700
Franáois day. That lasted long.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.300
It is far away. Half hours.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.600
Had said that, you could have a ride with me.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.000
Good. I'll show you the house.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.400
Come on in.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.800
Can you take off your shoes? - Sure.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.100
Thanks.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.500
There is an artist in your son. - That's mine.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.200
I paint since I stay home for Rami.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.900
This is the sitting room, the remote controls

09:46.400 --> 09:49.200
the television, the DVD player

09:49.400 --> 09:54.300
the blinds, the curtains, and the fireplace.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.700
The fish I have given food.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.100
And Phoenix also.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.800
A beautiful beast. - Marc is fascinated by ornithology.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.500
A rare species. He has him for twenty years.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.800
He got him before we knew each other.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.600
There is the kitchen.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Rami takes morning Nesquik, a roll with Nutella.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.400
Why in the morning? - We come back tomorrow around 18 hours.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.700
Ah so? - I forget the most important.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.500
Rami has asthma. This is his puffer in the case of.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.000
In the cabinets ...

10:31.300 --> 10:35.300
No, you can put anything on the cabinet.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.700
That sign is all that Marc has his father.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.600
He is extremely attached to it.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.000
Your room is upstairs next to the playroom Rami. I will call him.

10:46.300 --> 10:50.100
Rami, you can just come down?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.500
This is Franck.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.600
Say day, Rami. - Day Rami.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.600
He is shy, within two hours is about.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.600
Go give your daddy a kiss? He is loading.

11:13.900 --> 11:17.700
Why does not he? - Please, darling. He's busy.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.100
As usual. - What are we waiting for?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.500
What's wrong? - You should come to the football.

11:26.300 --> 11:29.600
I have to it for my work, not to play golf.

11:29.900 --> 11:33.400
Next time I will definitely participate, I promise. - But it is the final.

11:33.700 --> 11:37.900
The next time then. And I buy a sweater from PSG. Okay?

11:38.100 --> 11:40.000
The pot.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.400
I buy everything he wants and he is still not satisfied.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.700
That's for you. We'll call you later.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.300
Thank you. - See you tomorrow.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.100
See you tomorrow. Good trip.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.800
That's cool.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.200
Mr. Schaudel! - Yes?

12:12.600 --> 12:17.400
Your hedge is over seven feet tall.

12:17.700 --> 12:21.100
I'm going to complain to the town if you do nothing about it.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.500
Well you said, sir Monet.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.300
Zagevent.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.800
Rami?

12:51.000 --> 12:51.900
Rami?

12:52.300 --> 12:55.100
Au, damn.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.400
Who said you could come in?

12:57.300 --> 13:00.300
We are not so well begun, but that does not matter.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.700
It's not too late. Will you come watch a movie?

13:04.100 --> 13:07.900
Within 3 count my room if I say that you've been to me.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.000
What? - One.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.600
Two.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.700
I hope everything goes well.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.500
Do not worry. He's a serious guy.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.800
I mean Rami.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.200
Why would not it go well?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.200
He becomes difficult.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.800
This is normal. For example, children of his age.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.500
We were rebellious when we were ten years.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.800
He is disappointed about the football match.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.800
We can ask the babysitter to take him.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.300
Which car? Your brand new 4x4?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.200
My Range? You can see that from here.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.700
It's not the final, but you see him play again.

13:53.900 --> 13:58.100
My dad never came to see the rugby and I've still a successful life.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.300
Speaking well?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.000
<i> Take off your shoes. </i>

14:13.900 --> 14:15.600
<i> Your shoes. </i>

14:18.400 --> 14:20.300
<i> I have your old man well known. </i>

14:24.100 --> 14:25.900
<i> Do you know that he is deceased? </i>

14:26.300 --> 14:29.400
<i> I did not know. How did he die? </i>

14:31.500 --> 14:32.900
Everything okay, Rami?

14:33.100 --> 14:36.000
<i> Do you need something? - That was his weakness </i>.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.600
<i> How do you know? </i>

14:38.800 --> 14:42.500
<i> Do you want to watch the movie? - I tell you that he had a weakness </i>.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.800
<i> Listen ... - He could be someone </i>.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.800
You should not ... I know you ... - Take me to the carnival.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.700
No. I stand before you and I do not want you getting hurt.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.500
<i> Watch for The Departed. A good movie. </i>

14:55.800 --> 14:58.400
No. That I have seen.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.200
DiCaprio dies at the end.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.100
<i> Hello? - It is Claire </i>.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.500
<i> Day Claire. Arrived safely? - Yes, thank you. Everything goes well? </i>

15:23.800 --> 15:26.500
<i> Yes, very good. - May I speak Rami </i>?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.900
<i> He sleeps all. </i>

15:29.200 --> 15:30.900
Already?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.600
<i> We have played a lot, so he sleeps very well. </i>

15:34.800 --> 15:38.300
<i> Then at least he's good. - Yes, indeed </i>.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.700
<i> Okay, tomorrow, Franck. - See you tomorrow. Thank you. </i>

15:42.600 --> 15:44.400
Where were you?

15:44.700 --> 15:49.300
I walk you search for an hour. - I wanted to know how it was with Rami.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.900
Patronize him not so. Here.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.600
Who is it? - No one, to take a picture of me.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.000
Come on, quickly, quickly.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.600
You look beautiful. - Thank you.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.400
<i> Yeah? - Hello, Mr. Schaudel </i>?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.200
<i> Yes. - This is the police </i>.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.300
If you live on the Rue de la ferme 7?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.000
Yes, why?

16:39.300 --> 16:42.000
<i> There's been an incident tonight at home. </i>

16:42.200 --> 16:44.800
An incident? What happened?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Difficult to explain on the phone. - Is Rami?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.700
<i> Is it our son? - Your son </i>

16:50.000 --> 16:52.100
Yes, he is at home with the babysitter.

16:52.300 --> 16:56.100
<i> I'm sorry, but there's no one here. - Why, no one </i>?

16:59.900 --> 17:01.900
<i> Hello? - Franck, it's Claire Schaudel </i>.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.100
No, ma'am, the police again.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.500
<i> Apparently the babysitter left his phone at home. </i>

17:43.700 --> 17:45.400
What's ...

17:48.100 --> 17:49.800
What happened?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.400
Commissioner Laville.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.500
Mr. and Mrs. Schaudel? - Yes.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.000
Have you found my son? - Not yet.

17:56.400 --> 18:00.000
There is a crisis created and sent out an APB.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.200
Emitted at 3 am.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.800
This is a nightmare. - Who warned you?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.700
Your car was involved in one-run. That's why we were here.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.900
My Range? - Yes.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.700
This is agent Caillaud.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.500
He proposes profiles of criminals.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.100
The babysitter might have abducted our son?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.900
That's hard to say now.

18:23.100 --> 18:27.400
He is not known to the police and he has no criminal record.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.900
But the biggest psychopaths often are not.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.100
The biggest psychopaths? Do you mean child murderers?

18:35.500 --> 18:40.400
Not required. Also rapists or organ traffickers.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.400
Then we'll find them alive.

18:42.700 --> 18:46.400
But not too optimistic that brings misfortune.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.300
Did you have a dispute with the babysitter? - No.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.600
This was below the bench. Perhaps a clue.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.200
Is this yours? - No.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.300
Enter here, it's maybe a snuff movie.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.600
What is a snuff movie? - A murder filmed with an amateur camera.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.700
We're going to watch it directly.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.400
Connect it at that.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.000
Quiet.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.400
Ready, boss. - Can we start?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.500
Go ahead.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.500
<i> Good evening everyone and welcome to Alex TV </i>

19:32.700 --> 19:36.000
<i> "Laughter blown" with the aim of one million views on YouTube. </i>

19:36.700 --> 19:40.300
I know. What does he do for my home? - Who is that?

19:40.700 --> 19:43.700
Idiotic courier who hit me yesterday.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.200
Let you format a PV?

19:45.500 --> 19:48.800
No, I have no points on ... he ran.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.400
<i> We go over to our reporter, Sam. </i>

19:53.600 --> 19:58.500
<i> This is a big night as we come to the birthday of our size Franck. </i>

19:58.700 --> 20:01.700
<i> Is he crying? Laugh? Crying with laughter? </i>

20:01.900 --> 20:04.300
<i> We'll now explore. </i>

20:05.700 --> 20:08.600
<i> Exciting. - His boss there is well-off </i>.

20:08.900 --> 20:12.600
<i> He pays no taxes and put everything in Swiss accounts. </i>

20:13.100 --> 20:14.900
<i> He pays workers in black. </i>

20:15.900 --> 20:18.400
That is not true. What nonsense.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.700
Yes, what nonsense.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.200
There he is. Happy birthday.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.600
What are you doing here? - Your birthday.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.300
You want me to get fired?

20:29.600 --> 20:31.800
And the small sleeps. - I love children.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.700
"I love children." That does not sound good.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.900
Sonia comes. - Sonia? That's a joke?

20:39.100 --> 20:42.600
No, they confirmed on Facebook. - No way. Get out.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.700
Call her to cancel.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.600
I got her number. - Say it like it is here.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.200
Let us inside. - I have the little fit.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
We have thought of everything.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.800
What is that? - A sedative.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.100
Are you crazy? Why not ecstasy?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.300
Ecstasy is too dangerous for a child.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.400
A sedative as well. - It is vegetable.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.900
Give him half a different dose.

21:06.100 --> 21:10.000
No way. No party and I stand by.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.900
Goodbye.

21:14.500 --> 21:18.400
Are you sure he does not wake up? - They sleep until tomorrow.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.500
Hold on. It's still risky. I hope it is not dangerous.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.900
What time did Sonia come? - That there will be.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.200
What a piece.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.200
The mother is super handsome. But he does not get out.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.100
He seems to be Gollum. - You are a bastard.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.500
Why? - You insult Gollum.

21:37.700 --> 21:41.300
They drugging my son and laugh at me. And I'm Gollum?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.700
Wait till they encounter Gollum. On their bakkes.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.200
And I'm Gollum?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.700
Who is Gollum anyway?

21:51.500 --> 21:52.400
I don’t know.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.800
<i> Damn, calling the mother. </i>

21:55.100 --> 21:56.600
Put them my regards.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.600
Silent. From the room. - Madam, I love you.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.600
Silence you. - I did not say anything.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.400
<i> It's Claire. </i>

22:05.600 --> 22:07.800
Claire day. Arrived safely?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.400
<i> Yes, thank you. Everything goes well? </i>

22:10.700 --> 22:12.600
Yes, very well.

22:12.900 --> 22:16.100
<i> May I speak Rami? - He sleeps all </i>.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.300
<i> Now all? </i>

22:18.600 --> 22:22.200
We have played a lot so he sleeps very well.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.500
<i> Then at least he's good. - Yes, indeed </i>.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.300
<i> Okay, tomorrow, Franck. - Until tomorrow </i>.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.500
Sleep well, Adolfje.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.500
Leave him alone, damn.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.000
That's still not bad.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.200
What is that? - The bell.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.300
Sonia?

22:51.900 --> 22:53.900
What is all this? You said only Sonia would come.

22:54.100 --> 22:57.200
No, she would come. Not that she was the only one.

22:58.300 --> 23:01.000
Excuse me, excuse me.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.200
Good evening, everyone. Excuse.

23:04.400 --> 23:09.100
It is very nice that you have come for my birthday.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.800
And for the beer ...

23:11.000 --> 23:14.700
And for the beer. A small problem. I fear that ...

23:15.000 --> 23:16.400
Franck day.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
Happy birthday. - Sonia.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.500
What is she doing there? - Who is that?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.600
She has worked for me. Until last year.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.000
Sonia Lamar. I never forget a face.

23:27.300 --> 23:31.400
Love that you came. - I had nothing else to do.

23:34.300 --> 23:38.500
Well ... Welcome everyone.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.700
Can you take your shoes off?

23:42.600 --> 23:45.200
I told you he was funny.

23:46.100 --> 23:49.500
No, really. Can you ... I mean it.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.900
Where can I put this? - The kitchen is there.

23:54.300 --> 23:58.400
Have you had problems with her? Dismissal, sexual harassment?

23:59.100 --> 24:00.300
Not at all.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.300
Rigot, I want the number for that Sonia Lamar.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.400
This resembles the case Pascal René.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.200
The case Pascal René? - A child that has disappeared.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.700
Have you found him? - Yes, but not in one piece.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.000
Look at the labels.

24:17.300 --> 24:21.300
Just old wine. All expire. Look.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.400
Stop it. I do not feel well. - What is it?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.400
Have you seen Sonia? - Yes, and then?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.200
Turn that off.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.600
What's wrong with Sonia? - What a killer bitch.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.100
I would leave my family for her. - You have no family.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.400
Then it is less painful for them.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.600
That you can not do Franck tonight. - I know.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.500
Tomorrow. - You're right, I'm stuck.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.300
Tonight I see Lucie, a married woman.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.200
What do you do? - I'll take what Ruinart.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.100
You take nothing with it. Back to top. - One bottle.

24:55.300 --> 24:58.000
Put that back. Upwards. - What are we drinking?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.200
Come on, Alex.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.700
Have they given you drink?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.200
It's nice, but far. - Yes.

25:07.400 --> 25:11.300
Sonia, my friends, Sam and Alex. - Hello.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.300
Hello.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.500
This is Ernest. My sex buddy.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.400
But no, he is my cousin. He is married.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
And love. Hello.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.500
Pleased to meet you. Sonia talks a lot about you.

25:30.700 --> 25:35.100
Sylvain here, there Sylvain Sylvain did this ...

25:35.300 --> 25:37.400
My name is Franck. - I see.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.500
That's not bad. You also see a nice guy out.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.500
Who wants a drink? Sonia, I Ruinart.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.300
No, I do not drink alcohol anymore. - Why not?

25:46.500 --> 25:49.500
I'm really freaked out at my farewell drink at Schaudel.

25:49.700 --> 25:53.100
I was so drunk that I remember nothing more.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.400
Nothing at all? - A total blackout.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.100
I want a glass of Ruinart.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.400
Not prefer a Schweppes? - No, Ruinart is good.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.900
Everything okay? - Yes.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.200
Want a drink? - Yes.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.700
A chicken. - A goat.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.800
A velociraptor. - Yes.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.100
Earlier, the mother of Franck. - I can also imitate a tortoise.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.300
That is cool.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.400
Great.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.200
I'm a fan.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.400
Amazing what you do with your body. - I can do much more.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.500
I can well imitate a sea lion. - Display.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.300
The sea lion.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.400
You will also work with Manpower? - Yes.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.200
My wife also. - That's cool.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.700
There is the Ruinart.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.900
You go mobile, Sonia.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.900
That's my friend. - You have a boyfriend?

27:13.100 --> 27:15.600
Did you want me maybe decorate?

27:18.700 --> 27:21.100
Sonia, I'm sorry. - Simpleton.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.100
Sorry. Where he flew against?

27:23.300 --> 27:25.700
My mouth. What a fool.

27:25.900 --> 27:29.200
I am sorry - Now you've got it all made.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.400
You're bleeding not?

27:32.700 --> 27:36.000
I am sorry He flew right out. I do not often open bottles.

27:36.200 --> 27:40.600
Is it? - It goes, it goes.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.500
It's all right.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.800
I'm going to open it. - Do you see anything?

27:45.800 --> 27:48.100
Surprise. - Where's the party?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.200
Damn, guys. You believe that?

27:51.400 --> 27:53.900
Is not it a costume party? - No, sorry.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.800
Great. - We are so come by subway.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.300
Here, with this being the better.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.100
I knew nothing. I organize not.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.300
We sound at Franck and our student years.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.300
With Blanchard. - The Professor economy?

28:08.500 --> 28:11.500
Yes. - The sex bomb of the class.

28:11.700 --> 28:14.000
The brunette. Anyone who fucked.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.200
What a mattress. And no entrance fee.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.900
The slut.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.800
She ate a pig, but she went himself as a beast rampage.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.800
What was her name? - No idea.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.700
Myriam? - Yes, Myriam Elalaoui.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.000
That's my sister. - Really?

28:37.400 --> 28:40.000
I'll see if the minor is still asleep.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.900
Grease Lapps.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.900
Same name. - We have fucked his sister.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.000
We fucked his sister. - I've also fucked.

28:52.300 --> 28:55.800
Bastard. - Everyone has been served.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.600
Look, Gérard de Gaulle.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.900
What a ridiculous mustache.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.700
Happy birthday, Francky.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.300
Happy birthday, Franck.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.900
Happy birthday, Franck.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.500
Say happy birthday, Coco.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.700
Happy birthday, Franck.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.600
Would you like to drink? Are you thirsty? Wait a minute.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.100
Here, that is Ruinart.

29:24.700 --> 29:28.700
Nice, huh? Okay, enough, or you are still addicted to the drink.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.200
What? Want some?

29:37.600 --> 29:41.300
Damn, he does not move. I think he's dead.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.500
We have slain him? Damn.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.400
Now what? - We have to resuscitate him.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.300
Quick, before Franck sees.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.700
Put it in your briefs. - That stinks.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.400
And then? He's dead, he still smells nothing.

30:00.700 --> 30:04.400
What are you doing here? Is he dead?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.900
No. - Yes, he seems dead.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.000
No, not yet.

30:09.700 --> 30:12.400
<i> Wait. One, two, three, four ... </i>

30:12.800 --> 30:15.000
<i> five and six. One, two, three, four. </i>

30:15.400 --> 30:17.700
<i> It's an animal. Do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. </i>

30:18.000 --> 30:20.700
<i> One, two, three ... one, two, three ... </i>

30:22.200 --> 30:25.500
<i> one, two, three ... one, two, three ... </i>

30:26.200 --> 30:29.400
<i> Wake up, Coco. Wait, I'm going to take his pulse. </i>

30:33.300 --> 30:34.600
<i> We have to think of something. </i>

30:37.800 --> 30:39.600
<i> Wait, do not move. </i>

30:39.800 --> 30:41.300
<i> Fly, Coco. </i>

30:43.600 --> 30:46.400
Commissioner Sonia Lamar is unreachable.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.900
Leave a message. Ask if they call back.

30:50.300 --> 30:53.300
The whole house has been searched. No trace of the child.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.900
Have you looked in the freezer?

30:55.300 --> 30:57.700
No, it's not true. - That can not.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.100
Enough is enough.

31:03.900 --> 31:08.000
Now blown fuses? - Happy birthday, buddy.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.800
Blow them out.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.800
Forward.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.000
Good job.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.500
Take it, I made them.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.000
Really? - Yes.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.400
Take it, I've made myself.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.100
What is it? - That's vanilla and chicken.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.700
That is chocolate and chilli.

31:36.800 --> 31:40.000
And the pink is ratatouille and blueberries.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.700
Is it good? - Yes, very nice.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.400
Delicious. - Really?

31:45.600 --> 31:49.900
Come on, a speech. - Speech, speech.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.900
I do not give speeches.

31:57.100 --> 32:00.400
Thanks for coming to my birthday. - And for the beer.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.600
But I must ask you to leave.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.900
This is the house of my boss and I only here on his child.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.100
I hope you understand that. I am sorry

32:15.000 --> 32:18.900
That's a joke. - Very funny, though.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.700
I'm looking for the owner.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.600
Good evening, police. I'm looking for the owner.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.900
I am that. No, but it's complicated. Why?

32:30.100 --> 32:33.100
Are you or not? - No, but I pass on their child.

32:33.300 --> 32:36.800
There is a complaint from neighbors about the noise.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.100
I need to speak directly to the owners.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.900
Do not bother, that people just went away.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.700
Have you been drinking? - Just a little.

32:44.900 --> 32:48.000
While you can fit on a child? - A glass ...

32:48.200 --> 32:49.800
You come along. - That is not necessary.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.400
Everyone went away. What do you do?

32:52.600 --> 32:56.300
I swear. Those people were just leaving. That is no joke.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.800
Happy birthday, buddy.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.500
Happy birthday, buddy. - I filmed everything.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.800
You enjoyed it, huh?

34:42.100 --> 34:45.200
I wanted to be in your place. - That will do.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.800
Do not worry, I've found another shirt.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.900
Gang bastards. Something to do with Sonia there.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.600
It was to laugh. You are still enjoyed it.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.400
With an ass of a stranger in my face, with Sonia there?

34:59.700 --> 35:04.000
I have not enjoyed it. I can imagine nothing worse.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.900
Franck? - What is it?

35:06.100 --> 35:07.600
Behind you.

35:12.600 --> 35:13.700
He does not sleep.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.800
He sleepwalking fixed. That must be it.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.000
Rami.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.200
Rami! Wait!

35:27.600 --> 35:29.500
I will explain.

35:29.700 --> 35:32.300
I am 30 and this was the idea of ??my friends.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.300
I try to send them away.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.000
I wish your father knows nothing of. Can you remain silent?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.700
Of course. But then I want 300 euros.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.900
What? - 300 euros. Or I call my father.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.600
How do I get 300 euros?

35:46.800 --> 35:50.000
My parents still give you money? You have three seconds: one ...

35:50.200 --> 35:52.000
Rami, are you crazy or what?

35:52.500 --> 35:54.200
Otherwise, I'll call my father.

36:03.600 --> 36:07.400
Satisfied? - 100 euro too little. I'll call my dad.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.000
Wait, I have not.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.000
Wait in your room upon me.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.500
Would you borrow me some money?

36:15.800 --> 36:18.500
Of course, Sylvain.

36:19.300 --> 36:22.700
I'll pay you back definitely. - How much? Do you have a pen?

36:24.900 --> 36:28.200
What do you want? Money? - No, no, never mind.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.900
I only have five euros.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Rami, I have 30 euros.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.600
Rami? Where is he? - No idea.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.600
Rami? - Rami?

36:45.900 --> 36:48.800
Your mobile phone is on that chair. - Damn.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.400
What is all this? - What is it?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.900
13 missed calls.

36:57.100 --> 37:01.100
The pus. He has a text message sent to all women.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.900
What text?

37:05.100 --> 37:07.800
You want to fuck your ass.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.300
Apparently there is someone interested.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.000
I killed him. I make him.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.500
<i> I killed him. </i>

37:20.500 --> 37:21.700
"I killed him."

37:22.100 --> 37:24.200
Amory goes to a psychologist?

37:24.500 --> 37:28.000
No idea. I hardly know him. I've seen him twice.

37:28.300 --> 37:31.700
You said you knew him well. You let our child to a stranger?

37:32.100 --> 37:36.000
Is it my fault that your babysitter us in the lurch?

37:36.300 --> 37:39.100
Are you crazy? Your evening goes on Rami?

37:39.400 --> 37:41.800
You're the most selfish man I know.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.100
I would not be so self-centered?

37:44.400 --> 37:46.900
You call your name when we make love.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.000
<i> Rami? </i>

37:55.000 --> 37:56.400
<i> Rami? </i>

37:57.200 --> 37:58.900
<i> Is he in the garden? - No </i>.

38:03.900 --> 38:07.200
Sam. The small is gone. Come and search it.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.200
Do not worry. I find him.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.200
Rami.

38:12.100 --> 38:13.900
Where is that little pus?

38:15.700 --> 38:19.400
That bedroom is crazy. - Where are you? It's not funny.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
She would have seen me? - Yes, I've seen you.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.600
I'm sorry, Sonia. - Not very.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.400
I've seen her panties.

38:35.700 --> 38:39.100
Sam, have you seen him?

38:39.300 --> 38:41.300
Searched everywhere, nothing found.

38:41.500 --> 38:45.200
Day guys. What's the plan? Want to play Scrabble?

38:45.500 --> 38:47.200
No time. We are looking for a child.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.000
Rami? - Yes.

38:49.300 --> 38:52.200
The small, sweater, red hood? - Yes, that's him.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.100
No, not seen.

38:55.100 --> 38:59.200
I was joking. He is at home with the bike.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.600
This is his home. - I do not know where he went.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.100
A runaway. That there is still lacked.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.300
I get a car and then go look for him.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.900
Damn.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.100
I have found a car.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.100
What a container. I go in the front.

39:21.300 --> 39:24.600
Where are you going? - The small is off.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.600
You're not serious. - Yes it is.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.300
Wait, I'll go.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.300
Come on. I'll explain.

39:31.400 --> 39:35.000
We have a problem and have to leave.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.700
Can you anyone outside of work?

39:37.900 --> 39:40.800
No problem. - Everything is under control.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.500
Thanks, guys. Forward. Get out.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.000
Where can he go?

39:49.500 --> 39:52.900
We have to be in place. Where would he go?

39:53.100 --> 39:56.000
I am as a child once runaway. - To where?

39:56.200 --> 39:58.700
After 3 days, still they missed me not.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.300
I then went home.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.300
Look there.

40:04.600 --> 40:09.000
The carnival. Of course. There we go.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.600
And we look for that kid later.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.300
Damn, I had forgotten her.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.300
Who? - Lucie, who married woman.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.500
As my wife is too. - A married woman?

40:18.700 --> 40:22.300
To help the couple. She's frustrated.

40:22.400 --> 40:26.200
What are you sympathetic. - Exactly. Look how happy she is.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.000
<i> Hello? -? Hi </i>

40:28.200 --> 40:31.300
Plans have changed. The party is over.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.200
<i> I was just about to leave. Will you come to my house? </i>

40:34.400 --> 40:36.500
I'm far from the 15th arrondissement.

40:36.700 --> 40:40.300
That is not far. I come from there. At most 25 minutes.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.600
I can be there in 25 minutes.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.800
<i> Perfect. My husband is still not home. </i>

40:46.100 --> 40:48.100
<i> Are you sure? - Yes, very definitely </i>.

40:48.300 --> 40:51.000
<i> He is with his niece to a party in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. </i>

40:52.700 --> 40:53.800
<i> Hello! </i>

40:55.300 --> 40:57.000
Ha.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.800
I'm going to show. - Give that phone here.

41:00.300 --> 41:02.300
<i> Lucie? - Ernest </i>?

41:03.700 --> 41:05.400
<i> Poepie, is that you? </i>

41:06.100 --> 41:08.300
Yes, it is poepie, slut.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.800
I'll make you fall!

41:10.100 --> 41:13.400
I could not have known. - You fuck my wife.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.600
Quiet. - I want to get off.

41:16.800 --> 41:20.100
Stop immediately, I want to get off.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.600
Sam fucks the wife of Ernest.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.600
Stop filming.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.700
The door. - The door, damn it.

41:31.100 --> 41:34.400
Ernest, is it? - You can go to hell.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.900
Nice friends you have.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.900
Wait, Ernest. It is a misunderstanding.

41:39.100 --> 41:43.300
A misunderstanding. Lucie's 15th who calls her husband Poepie.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
I Poepie. And you fucking my wife.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.900
Ernest, come back.

41:52.100 --> 41:56.400
The cops. Also that yet. Hold this, Sam.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.200
I did not know.

42:00.500 --> 42:03.600
Good evening. Can you shut the engine down

42:03.800 --> 42:07.100
and give the papers of the car? - Of course.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.900
No problem. - Stop!

42:10.100 --> 42:12.500
Alex, what are you doing? - Everything under control.

42:12.700 --> 42:15.700
Nothing in control. - Stop, Alex!

42:15.900 --> 42:19.000
I have no license and no papers of the car.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.200
No papers? Where did you find that car?

42:22.400 --> 42:23.800
In the garage of the family Schaudel.

42:24.100 --> 42:27.400
I'll bring it tomorrow to the garage of a friend.

42:27.500 --> 42:30.500
Guys, there Rami.

42:30.700 --> 42:33.300
Turn back. - The cops are behind us.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.500
Turn back. - The cops are behind us.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.400
This can not be. - Stop!

42:38.500 --> 42:40.700
Damn, there they are.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.800
Good evening. - Stop immediately.

42:44.200 --> 42:47.900
Yes, we are going to stop. Stop, asshole.

42:48.200 --> 42:52.000
I have my identity not. Stop, please.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.300
Stop the car, now.

42:54.500 --> 42:57.600
I do not see you, I do not see you.

42:57.900 --> 43:00.100
I do not see you. I do not see you.

43:00.300 --> 43:02.000
Stop, Alex. Please.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.200
Alex, if we crash, I'll kill you!

43:10.800 --> 43:14.300
Do not worry, I'm going to lose them.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.800
I've fucked.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.700
I'm going to give everything.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.400
Sam, look.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.400
Who's Sebastien Loeb of the woods? IK.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.600
Now you really should stop. - Stop, damn it!

43:32.800 --> 43:37.200
I have everything under control. - The rear!

43:38.500 --> 43:43.400
Look how I maneuver. A rally, left, right.

43:43.700 --> 43:47.900
It's fast!

43:48.500 --> 43:52.400
I've shaken. Can not thank you wonder?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.100
Fortunately, he is not broken.

43:59.900 --> 44:02.400
Do not pull that face.

44:03.100 --> 44:07.600
It does look impressive, but it's not so bad.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.300
I got them anyway shaken off, huh?

44:16.400 --> 44:18.000
I want to die.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.700
And I want you dead.

44:24.600 --> 44:27.800
Now just find Rami, somewhere dead in the woods.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.800
And then it's done. - Do not worry.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.400
He is now eating solid candy. We're going to look for him.

44:36.700 --> 44:39.500
The cops are coming. We gotta get outta here.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.500
Look, it's down there. There's the fair.

44:43.700 --> 44:45.700
Fast. - I see nothing.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.000
Hurry up, they are going to be so here.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.700
What have they done to my Range?

44:50.900 --> 44:54.200
You Range can be stolen. And your house too.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.400
Are there not more important things?

45:00.500 --> 45:02.300
Who is it? - Your mother.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.200
For APB. Do not you take on?

45:05.500 --> 45:07.500
No, it's bad enough.

45:08.100 --> 45:11.700
I did not mean it. You know her. That will take hours.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.700
I had more to her to listen.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.300
And? - He does not answer. He gets home?

45:23.700 --> 45:26.000
Sam, now you can go to his wife.

45:26.300 --> 45:27.800
Shut up, Alex.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
What a mess.

45:31.700 --> 45:34.900
Are you sure it's down here? - No idea.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.800
And all the men here? Is there a parking lot?

45:40.100 --> 45:42.000
Parking for dicks.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.700
This is a bunch of prostitutes.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.800
Really? - Yes.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.700
Good evening. - Good evening.

45:54.100 --> 45:57.600
I was there for an investigation. - A large study.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.800
What?

46:01.500 --> 46:02.800
Good evening. - Good evening.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.600
Where are we?

46:07.900 --> 46:10.300
Here we are.

46:11.700 --> 46:13.500
Watch out.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.000
Thank you.

46:19.700 --> 46:22.900
Did you see how she looked at me? - It was a whore.

46:23.100 --> 46:25.400
And then? What do you know of women?

46:26.100 --> 46:28.400
She looked at me. - It's a whore.

46:28.600 --> 46:31.500
She looked at you like that? No. Well then.

46:31.700 --> 46:33.700
That's not bad. It's a whore.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.000
She would make me want to. - 50 Euro.

46:36.300 --> 46:38.400
She does that for 25 euros.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.500
In that case, ...

46:46.900 --> 46:50.800
That reminds me of the time I was carefree and silly.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.200
Last week?

46:52.500 --> 46:56.300
Let's go find Rami and then we're gone. Come on.

46:57.500 --> 46:58.800
Rami.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.400
Rami.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.100
That's not him.

47:04.700 --> 47:06.500
I found him there.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.900
Rami ...

47:09.700 --> 47:12.100
Excuse me, sir. There he is.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.100
Rami. - Franck.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.600
Make me so worried. Home.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.800
No way. - Yes it is. Come on.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.300
Stressful enough for today. Get out of here.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.100
Enough played with my balls. We're gone.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.900
Go. Let me go.

47:28.100 --> 47:31.600
Help. I get kidnapped. - Stop that. Come on.

47:31.800 --> 47:35.800
Help, they are pedof ... - It's okay. I'm going to let go.

47:36.100 --> 47:40.500
He makes a joke. Does not it?

47:42.500 --> 47:44.100
We eat a waffle.

47:45.500 --> 47:47.700
Eat your waffle on because we do not stay long.

47:47.900 --> 47:51.400
It's nice here. Do you eat him. That will relax you.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.800
I do not want your waffle. - Yes, to excuse me.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
I do not want. - Please to excuse me.

48:00.500 --> 48:05.000
Okay, very funny. What we have fun.

48:05.700 --> 48:08.200
Say rather what attraction you want.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.700
There!

48:12.700 --> 48:14.700
Since you're too small.

48:14.900 --> 48:17.500
If there is someone, do it.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.100
But I tell you that it should not.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.500
Come on, I want to do this. Do not be a sissy.

48:23.700 --> 48:25.400
You're not very brave.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.300
Franck is not brave. I'll go with it.

48:28.500 --> 48:32.700
No, I'll go. I just do not think he is ill.

48:34.700 --> 48:36.100
Where can I buy tickets? - There.

48:40.800 --> 48:45.100
You know you can do from there? - Yes.

48:45.900 --> 48:47.900
Would you like? - No, you know.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.700
Because then I ask it.

48:56.900 --> 48:58.900
Relax, Franck.

48:59.100 --> 49:01.400
I am relaxed.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.500
What power.

49:17.700 --> 49:20.200
There are women who orgasm in something.

49:20.500 --> 49:23.500
Really? - Yes. We can go together if you want.

49:23.700 --> 49:26.800
Do you have something need to make a girl orgasm?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.100
But no, it's just ...

49:29.700 --> 49:33.000
Something to make orgasm a girl. - But no.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.400
The loser.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.500
Have you done in your pants?

49:37.500 --> 49:39.800
Franck, it is against you.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.600
Have you done in your pants? - No.

49:42.800 --> 49:46.400
Are you OK? - So cool. Watch the video.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.500
That face.

50:07.500 --> 50:10.000
A stretchy mouth.

50:10.300 --> 50:13.400
You were more afraid than I am. Look, you're scared.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.900
You see well that you're more afraid than I am.

50:18.100 --> 50:20.100
Look, yes.

50:20.300 --> 50:24.000
Makes you sick in. We do not do that anymore.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.200
<i> Where do we go? </i>

50:26.600 --> 50:28.200
<i> I do not know. </i>

51:14.200 --> 51:16.100
Oh shoot

51:16.400 --> 51:19.000
What was that? Is it done?

51:46.700 --> 51:48.400
I do not feel so good.

51:54.200 --> 51:57.100
Is that for me? - What do I get in return?

51:57.400 --> 51:58.900
A kiss.

52:01.300 --> 52:04.000
Have you seen a ghost? - Here.

52:04.300 --> 52:06.300
Can I exchange it?

52:06.500 --> 52:09.700
No, there are some nice attractions. - Come on.

52:13.700 --> 52:16.600
What is a dark room? - There it is dark.

52:20.500 --> 52:25.000
What? What is it?

52:31.100 --> 52:32.200
Along true?

52:34.200 --> 52:37.000
What was that? - I walked from somewhere.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.800
Careful. - Alex, where are you?

52:39.000 --> 52:40.800
Right behind you. - Who is that?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.100
I am that. - That is Sonia.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.400
I see nothing. - Me neither.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.900
What did you think of the attraction?

53:13.200 --> 53:16.100
I've never had so many jitters.

53:16.300 --> 53:18.500
Really? - Yes.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.800
Do you like it? - I would do it again.

53:25.700 --> 53:27.400
Why are you laughing?

53:28.800 --> 53:32.300
I filmed everything. - Wow say.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.600
Why are you laughing?

53:34.800 --> 53:39.100
We will see the show, but promise you're not going mugs.

53:39.300 --> 53:42.700
No problem. - What?

53:44.400 --> 53:48.200
It was to laugh. - I see the humor in it.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.100
Come on.

53:50.300 --> 53:54.200
I should be angry. You do not notice that you're a man coast.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.800
Great. Nice atmosphere.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.600
And Rami, what would you be?

54:03.900 --> 54:06.300
Your boyfriend. If you're still looking.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.200
Dreams can not hurt. - He's right.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.500
What is your dream, Alex?

54:15.700 --> 54:18.500
Okay, thank you, Alex.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.300
The last 30 minutes forgotten. - Remember that now anyway.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.300
Publishing his own comic. - I can forget.

54:31.500 --> 54:35.200
Seriously now, Rami. A real dream ...

54:39.400 --> 54:42.100
My father is watching as I play football.

54:48.800 --> 54:50.200
I do not like football.

54:53.700 --> 54:56.500
<i> What is your dream, Sonia? - So much </i>.

54:57.300 --> 55:00.800
Have a penis for an hour, to know what that is.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.700
A cupcake chain open worldwide.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.100
A beautiful experience love with a good man. For once.

55:11.600 --> 55:15.400
And Franck and Sam stop mugs. - Yes, I agree.

55:17.100 --> 55:20.200
Okay, what an atmosphere. Great.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.600
What will you do?

55:36.300 --> 55:39.500
What did you ask? - Something that makes you smile again.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.300
What then? - Come on.

55:41.500 --> 55:44.700
No, I'm not. - Come sing. Come on.

55:44.900 --> 55:46.800
Forward, Francky. - Just like old times.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.300
I can not sing. - Come on.

55:48.300 --> 55:49.500
No, I can not sing.

55:49.500 --> 55:52.900
â ™ ª When I had you to myself I did not want you around â ™ ª

55:53.600 --> 55:57.300
â ™ ª Those pretty face always made you stand out in a crowd â ™ ª

55:58.000 --> 56:01.900
â ™ ª But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it fired â ™ ª

56:02.700 --> 56:06.200
â ™ ª Now it's much too late for me to take a second look â ™ ª

56:07.200 --> 56:10.100

57:07.100 --> 57:10.000
That was great. - Very fat.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.900
Not bad.

57:12.200 --> 57:14.000
You're jealous. - Thanks.

57:21.100 --> 57:24.100
It was still funny. You have to let go some more.

57:24.500 --> 57:28.400
I'm not a stiff rake. - Then this button loose.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.800
I'm not going to eat.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.700
Do you remember all of your farewell drink.

57:35.900 --> 57:37.600
Why did you say to the contrary?

57:38.400 --> 57:40.300
Because you never called me back.

57:41.400 --> 57:43.200
Surely you've got a friend.

57:43.400 --> 57:46.400
If you can call it that. I know him from yesterday.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.600
How far is your house? - 30 minutes.

57:49.900 --> 57:53.600
What a bad luck, too bad we do not have a car anymore.

57:54.300 --> 57:57.600
At the dinner for idiots gonna be all alone.

57:59.800 --> 58:02.100
What are you doing? - Ernest.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.200
Ernest, come down there.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.500
What is it? - What's the problem?

58:10.700 --> 58:14.100
Are you his size? Do you know him?

58:14.300 --> 58:16.800
Yes, why? - Pay no. Drinking beer.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.100
He eats fries. He keeps me fooled.

58:20.500 --> 58:22.600
What do you mean no? - Nothing.

58:22.900 --> 58:25.200
You laughing at me? Is that your boyfriend?

58:25.400 --> 58:29.400
He says he has eaten and drunk and refuses to pay.

58:30.300 --> 58:33.200
We laugh you out. We did not understand.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.700
We're going to pay you. How much is it?

58:35.900 --> 58:38.300
This is for ...

58:38.500 --> 58:40.600
Ernest, you idiot.

58:40.800 --> 58:44.600
My goodness. - Come Rami, get out.

58:46.900 --> 58:49.800
That was quite a blow.

58:51.500 --> 58:54.500
Hide. There. - Yes, there.

58:57.400 --> 59:00.200
Are you crazy? - He fucked my wife.

59:00.400 --> 59:04.100
The fairground behind us. - Those are not normal.

59:04.400 --> 59:07.000
Even Chuck Norris let the fairground alone.

59:07.200 --> 59:10.100
There they are. Hide.

59:12.200 --> 59:15.500
They are gone. We can go. - I can not.

59:15.700 --> 59:19.200
What is it, Rami? - Got my puffer at?

59:19.400 --> 59:21.700
You puffer? I do not have to.

59:22.700 --> 59:25.400
His asthma. - It'll be okay.

59:25.700 --> 59:29.100
This is serious. My brother is so dead.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.900
I do not want to hear.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.700
He is deceased ... - What do we just say?

59:37.300 --> 59:39.100
I've been saying nothing.

59:41.500 --> 59:45.000
We have to call the fire department. - Then stand the fairground here.

59:45.200 --> 59:46.700
And calling his parents.

59:46.900 --> 59:49.400
Another 30 minutes steps. Now what?

59:49.600 --> 59:51.400
30 minutes, that is. - Shut up.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.500
There are go-karts. - Yes, go-karts.

59:53.800 --> 59:56.000
I think not. Forget about it.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.500
Do you have a better idea? - Forward.

59:58.700 --> 1:00:00.700
I drive super good.

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.400
Do not touch me.

1:00:10.700 --> 1:00:14.300
What an idiot. I do not know if he can drive.

1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:27.400
Leave the camera here. - Hurry up, hurry up.

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:29.600
Hurry.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.100
Beware, Sam, behind you!

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:37.600
Accelerate, accelerate. Grab the camera.

1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:40.600
What are you doing? We have to help Sam.

1:00:40.900 --> 1:00:44.600
No, he can well judo. We can not do anything there.

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:47.000
You have to flip. - I flip.

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:49.800
Film job, awesome is that.

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:52.800
Watch out!

1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:56.900
Out of the way!

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.600
Out of the way.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.700
This is fantastic!

1:01:01.900 --> 1:01:05.400
<i> Fast and Furious, Sonia, Fast and Furious. </i>

1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:08.600
Vin Diesel can not compete here!

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:15.700
Watch out!

1:01:22.900 --> 1:01:25.900
Where is Sam? - Who had a problem.

1:01:26.300 --> 1:01:28.000
What kind of problem?

1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:32.300
The fairground. Throw away the banana. - What?

1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:34.700
You banana. Throw your banana to them.

1:01:46.100 --> 1:01:48.600
Well done.

1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:52.500
Look out for you. Watch out.

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:02.700
Great. Is this your dream, Sonia?

1:02:02.900 --> 1:02:05.800
How is Rami?

1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:08.100
We must not dawdle.

1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:36.500
Help me with his helmet.

1:02:38.900 --> 1:02:41.600
Is it? - Yeah, you know, why?

1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:43.800
Puts his helmet. Come on.

1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:48.600
Come on, boy. Here we are. Come on.

1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:52.700
Hold on, it'll be fine. - Out of the way.

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:56.400
Sorry, Rami. That was not intentional.

1:02:56.700 --> 1:03:00.300
But we're there and you're a strong boy.

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:02.900
Very strong. - Ernest is knockout.

1:03:07.700 --> 1:03:11.900
What is going on here?

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:14.800
<i> What's this? - We must do something </i>.

1:03:15.100 --> 1:03:17.500
Make some place and give me the puffer.

1:03:17.700 --> 1:03:20.100
Out of the way, damn it. - Rami.

1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:23.700
Breath, Rami. Again.

1:03:26.100 --> 1:03:29.200
Going, Rami? - Super Cool, that go-kart.

1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:37.400
I have 14 pizzas for Franck Amory. Do you know who that is?

1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:40.400
No idea. - He should pay me.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.400
Mr. Schaudel! Now!

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.600
You're like that old cartoon from that.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:55.700
<i> Yes, from Up. - From Up </i>.

1:03:57.900 --> 1:04:00.800
Come on, people. The party is over.

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.800
It's done. It's done. Done drinking.

1:04:06.100 --> 1:04:10.100
What a mess. Get out and done drinking.

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:14.100
Come on down. What is that?

1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:17.000
And samurai, come on down.

1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:20.000
You are not there. - Why not?

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:21.900
You have no bracelet. - No.

1:04:22.100 --> 1:04:25.600
Then you will not be there. - I know the owner.

1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:29.800
Look, the fish eat ecstasy.

1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:34.700
Look, he smokes a cigar with his ass.

1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:37.400
Hi, I'm Mr. Schaudel.

1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:41.900
I stink out of my mouth as I have a strontkop.

1:04:42.100 --> 1:04:44.600
Where did you find that? - Quiet.

1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:47.400
Where did you find that? - In the cigar box.

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:08.600
I told you to stop.

1:05:08.900 --> 1:05:10.800
Turn off the music.

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:18.700
Girls, which is a leather seat. Come off it.

1:05:18.900 --> 1:05:21.100
The party of the weirdos.

1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.600
No. Done drinking.

1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:29.900
Hey, dude. Want some stuff?

1:05:30.100 --> 1:05:32.300
Get out of here with that trade.

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:37.400
What do you do? No, that's not ...

1:05:42.100 --> 1:05:44.200
I found a child.

1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:48.900
Paul, I'll break your neck.

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:51.200
Franck, I was just about to call.

1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:54.100
Hopeless, people do not want road.

1:05:54.300 --> 1:05:56.800
I will ask again to leave.

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.900
No, we go in the jacuzzi. - Yes.

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:03.600
Let those little alone.

1:06:04.300 --> 1:06:06.100
Let those little alone, I say.

1:06:06.700 --> 1:06:08.300
This may in the sangria?

1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:11.600
No. Where did you find that? - In the basement.

1:06:11.900 --> 1:06:14.100
Stay down there.

1:06:14.300 --> 1:06:16.600
Where is the jacuzzi anyway?

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:19.200
They're going to throw him out the window.

1:06:28.900 --> 1:06:30.600
Going, Rami?

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:34.000
Stay there, I'll get you.

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:45.700
Fatso. That's for those dirty fuck SMS.

1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.800
No one comes to my ass. Fuck you, fatso.

1:06:49.100 --> 1:06:52.400
And stop filming me if I'm doing my dog ??fuck your mother.

1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:57.000
Alex, help me to get it out.

1:06:59.900 --> 1:07:01.300
Come, Rami.

1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:06.000
Is your camera waterproof?

1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:16.300
My camera. - Your camera can not care.

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.500
Do you think we have to do anything else?

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.700
Thank you, ma'am.

1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:38.500
We're going to dry in your room. - Excuse me.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.700
What is that smell?

1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:50.300
You're an asshole, I got you through. In line like everyone else.

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:52.900
What are you doing? - There he is.

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:56.600
He gets a sausage for his birthday.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000
Damn, that burns. - Okay, away.

1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:03.000
You away! Everybody out!

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:07.500
Everybody out. Everyone away. Fuck off, everyone!

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.000
What's that?

1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:40.200
What a battlefield.

1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:43.700
Forward, home. - No Christmas presents for you.

1:08:43.900 --> 1:08:46.000
Yes.

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:51.300
Get out. Go home to sleep.

1:08:53.900 --> 1:08:56.900
Look. Look.

1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:00.500
Look what you've done.

1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:03.700
Come on, get up. Go home.

1:09:03.900 --> 1:09:05.800
This is your fault. I hate you.

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.600
<i> It's just a bit messy. </i>

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.100
<i> I'm home now, but tomorrow at 9 am I'll help clean up. </i>

1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:15.200
And what about all that is broken? As the car ...

1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:18.600
<i> That is stolen while you slept and you have not heard. </i>

1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.400
<i> And for the house you say ... </i>

1:09:20.700 --> 1:09:23.600
<i> That men Greenpeace invaded. </i>

1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:27.300
<i> That they all might smash as Schaudel not recycle. </i>

1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:31.000
<i> You did what you could, just for the bird was too late. </i>

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:34.400
<i> The bird? - I think they have him break them </i>.

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:36.700
<i> Rami is saved. - The pizzas are paid </i>.

1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:38.400
Yes? - You do not remember.

1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:42.000
Alex, you've slain the parrot? - No, that was Greenpeace.

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:45.000
What happened to it? - It was Greenpeace.

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:48.000
What's with the parrot? - It is ...

1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:55.500
Franck day. You'll see this video ever do receive.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:10:00.000
I want to thank you. I have never been so well amused.

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:02.800
Even though you are sometimes annoying.

1:10:03.300 --> 1:10:06.700
I would like to have a dad like you want.

1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:10.900
<i> Someone who does nice things with me and play with me </i>

1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:13.500
<i> and who thinks of me, not to himself. </i>

1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:17.700
<i> So if you are looking for work, I take you as dad. </i>

1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:21.300
<i> Not the easiest profession </i>

1:10:21.500 --> 1:10:23.000
<i> but you get paid well. </i>

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:25.000
<i> And you get shorter working hours. </i>

1:10:25.300 --> 1:10:27.700
<i> Rami, where are you? - I'll be </i>.

1:10:27.900 --> 1:10:31.700
<i> Where are you? - On the crapper. I'm coming. </i>

1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:34.600
<i> That's what I meant by annoying. </i>

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:38.700
<i> I have to go. Happy birthday. </i>

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.400
<i> This was it. </i>

1:10:46.700 --> 1:10:49.100
<i> I hope you liked it with us. </i>

1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:52.600
Franck, a balance for your birthday?

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:55.200
Perhaps my last because tomorrow I'm dead.

1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:57.400
I do not know what I can expect.

1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.700
Please. - Thank you.

1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:03.200
Drink and go to bed, because tomorrow we get up early.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:10.700
I'm hungry. - Would you like a cupcake?

1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:13.800
No, I'm not such a big appetite.

1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:16.300
What's that noise?

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:19.600
What's this?

1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:22.100
There are still people out there? - No.

1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:34.300
My camera. My camera, fast.

1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:36.300
Common, common.

1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:40.200
To vultures.

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.400
<i> Look, the gentleman from Up. </i>

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:49.100
Real. - I want to talk to Mr. Schaudel.

1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:51.400
Leave him alone.

1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:54.000
I want to speak to Ms Schaudel.

1:11:54.300 --> 1:11:56.800
Done with that nonsense. Stop laughing.

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.700
There is a problem. - Yes, you!

1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:02.700
<i> Like that guy from Up. </i>

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.600
What is here?

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:09.100
Stop him. Let the balloons empty.

1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:11.200
Throw stones at!

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.600
Shooting, Rami.

1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:20.700
<i> This is the craziest thing I've ever filmed. </i>

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:23.500
<i> This will definitely get a million views on YouTube. </i>

1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:26.100
<i> It flashes? The battery is flat. </i>

1:12:31.100 --> 1:12:33.600
Back to square one. Now we know nothing yet.

1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:37.600
On the contrary. I think we know more.

1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:39.800
He lacks a father like you.

1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:44.500
That's possible, but we do not know where the little one is.

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:46.600
I have it!

1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:48.800
What? - Gollum, from earlier.

1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:50.800
We did not know who it was.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:55.100
<i> That's the ugly monster from the movie Lord of the Rings. </i>

1:12:55.300 --> 1:12:56.700
Caillaud. - Yes?

1:12:56.900 --> 1:13:01.000
Go wait in the office. What quickly.

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:09.800
Even the painting of the boy is spoiled.

1:13:10.100 --> 1:13:12.400
That is not the boy, damn it!

1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:19.200
Ok

1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:21.900
They had to get up early this morning.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.100
Do you know why? Apparently not to clean up.

1:13:25.300 --> 1:13:26.900
Wait ...

1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:37.600
What are you looking for?

1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:40.900
I know where they are.

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:50.100
Franck, I am.

1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:53.700
What a hell to stand on. Such headaches.

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.500
I have a product to the walls.

1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:03.300
Mr. and Mrs. Schaudel, you're back.

1:14:03.700 --> 1:14:06.000
What happened here tonight ... Unbelievable.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:08.800
Men Greenpeace invaded here.

1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:12.000
We have seen the video.

1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:15.400
Listen Mr. Schaudel,

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:18.400
it's gotten out of hand, but we have a lot saved.

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:22.300
Your board example, where you are so attached to.

1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:37.000
I'm sorry.

1:14:38.900 --> 1:14:40.900
That's because Golblem.

1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:44.900
Damn.

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:47.900
Let me go. I will not say anything.

1:14:48.100 --> 1:14:49.900
The Franck's his fault.

1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:52.500
I swear. Let me go.

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:59.700
Come on, Rami. Come on.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:29.900
Hello.

1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:33.200
Hello.

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:38.300
Back already? You would only be back to 18 hours.

1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:41.400
Is the ceremony went well?

1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:44.700
Good job.

1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:51.200
Coming just on or have you been home?

1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:56.700
Listen, it's not what you think.

1:15:56.900 --> 1:15:59.600
Men of Greenpeace ...

1:16:01.700 --> 1:16:04.800
Maybe it's not ... - Shut up.

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.900
I could not save you from my wife. Do not mess with me.

1:16:11.300 --> 1:16:13.400
Now that's a football match.

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:17.200
I forgot the dog.

1:16:19.700 --> 1:16:22.000
Marc ... - Mr. Schaudel.

1:16:22.700 --> 1:16:25.400
I'm not here for you. They did.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:28.600
You will not be picked up here.

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:32.300
I do not want to ruin the final. They wait for you.

1:16:42.900 --> 1:16:45.100
Range Rover: 85,000 euros.

1:16:45.300 --> 1:16:47.200
A Steinway piano: 24,000 euros.

1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:50.200
22 bottles of grand cru, a shirt

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:53.200
and moral damage to the board and the parrot.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:55.800
You're in the shit. Listen carefully ...

1:16:56.100 --> 1:16:57.800
No, you listen to me.

1:16:59.100 --> 1:17:02.200
Okay, we made some fur in your home.

1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:04.600
But Rami is completely blossomed.

1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:07.200
Without us you were not even here today.

1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:10.700
Besides, I have no money to pay you back.

1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:21.300
One more thing: You do not come Monday.

1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:46.200
What did he say?

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:48.700
I should not come Monday.

1:17:48.900 --> 1:17:53.100
Given a day off? Cool. Cause I'm broken.

1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:08.300
Young man, I have a signature?

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:10.000
Papa.

1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:13.300
Have you seen my goal?

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:16.800
Yes, I've seen it. And against such opponents.

1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.400
Have you seen it, Mom? - Yes, honey.

1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:26.900
Will we?

1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:30.100
Okay, we gotta go.

1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:39.600
Mr. Amory, we have to discuss.

1:18:39.900 --> 1:18:42.000
Wait a minute please.

1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:46.500
This evening I will not forget.

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:59.000
Stay there.

1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:32.000
<i> That's me, Franck Amory. </i>

1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:36.200
<i> Pretty in the drawing, but even better in real life. </i>

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:39.400
<i> I can realize my dream </i>

1:19:39.700 --> 1:19:42.300
<i> thanks to a highly motivated publisher. </i>

1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:43.900
Good day."

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:46.800
Good day. Lots of people.

1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:49.100
But autograph.

1:19:49.900 --> 1:19:51.700
What's your name?

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.400
Rami, we must go if we are late.

1:19:56.200 --> 1:19:58.400
Franck day. - Success for the contest.

1:19:58.600 --> 1:19:59.900
Yes.

1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:05.400
Please.

1:20:05.700 --> 1:20:08.100
You're welcome. Have a nice day and goodbye.
