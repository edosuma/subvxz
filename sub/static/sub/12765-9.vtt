00:01.100 --> 00:03.150
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:04.939
Is there a romantic interest
I'm not aware of?

00:05.050 --> 00:07.310
- Only Kyle.
- Kyle?

00:07.520 --> 00:09.580
I've see one of these symbols before.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.220
Kyle has a ring with this on it.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.530
He got it from his birth father.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.880
- Adam something.
- Adam Baylin?

00:14.900 --> 00:18.300
If Andy can't stay here,
then she has to move to Cleveland.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.530
I know that's gonna be hard for you to deal with.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.140
Everyone at Latnok seems genuine.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.800
But I'm still not convinced about Cassidy.

00:24.820 --> 00:26.210
You seen anyone around my office?

00:26.230 --> 00:28.080
Actually I caught Jessi there this morning.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.110
Jessi? I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts,

00:31.130 --> 00:33.850
but I also know she's volatile
and unpredictable.

00:33.870 --> 00:35.220
Her mother's no friend of Latnok.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.810
What do you know about Sarah?

00:37.416 --> 00:40.320
I found something in Cassidy's office.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.630
- He has Sarah's ring.
- How?

00:42.650 --> 00:45.010
I think he has something to do with her disappearance.

00:45.030 --> 00:48.450
You can recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories.

00:48.627 --> 00:50.150
It's working.

00:50.270 --> 00:51.715
I see something.

00:54.230 --> 00:55.330
He killed her!

00:55.350 --> 00:56.780
She's dead!

00:56.800 --> 00:58.999
My mother is dead.

00:59.019 --> 01:01.190
We need to find out why he did it.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.908
We will.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.200
Oh, hi, Jessi. I didn't know you were here.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.992
What's wrong?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.510
Jessi... Jessi!

02:06.520 --> 02:08.470
- Kyle...
- It's OK.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.964
What happened?

02:10.310 --> 02:12.698
I heard you thrashing around.

02:13.010 --> 02:14.798
It was just a bad dream.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.820
It was terrible.

02:17.090 --> 02:23.110
I was at Latnok and...
I don't really remember.

02:23.300 --> 02:27.350
Well, it's over now. Are you OK?

02:27.680 --> 02:30.110
Thank you for checking on me.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.480
It's late.

02:46.590 --> 02:48.740
We should get back to sleep.

02:50.730 --> 02:54.150
OK. Good night.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.500
Good night.

03:20.769 --> 03:24.323
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 8:
Guess Who's Coming To Dinner</font>

03:27.600 --> 03:30.350
Listen, Josh, I know you're upset about Andy leaving.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.750
I've been walking around with a pit in my stomach.

03:32.770 --> 03:34.900
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.970
And everytime I think about her being gone...

03:36.990 --> 03:38.600
But she's not yet.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.990
So don't waste your last few days together moping around.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.970
What am I supposed to do?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.389
Give her a big send-off.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.750
What are her favorite things?

03:47.770 --> 03:49.690
G-Force.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.780
But just playing that for
three days straight would be,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.730
well, what we always do.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.500
She's into the Cowkeys, but they're out on tour.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.330
And Star Trek.

03:58.350 --> 04:01.270
Star Trek? Popular science-fiction entertainment,

04:01.290 --> 04:05.800
encompassing six television series
and several feature films.

04:05.820 --> 04:09.031
Well, thank you, Mr. Wikipedia.

04:09.051 --> 04:12.420
- Have you seen any of them?
- No.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.640
We'll take you when the new movie comes out.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.320
You'll like Spock. He's half-Vulcan, half-human.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.360
Vulcan?

04:18.380 --> 04:19.829
Alien race.

04:19.850 --> 04:21.880
So he's different than everyone else.

04:21.899 --> 04:24.010
He struggles to understand human emotions.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.930
Sees the world from a unique perspective.

04:27.090 --> 04:28.860
Sounds interesting.

04:28.991 --> 04:31.730
Ah, our man from the pod can relate.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.700
Except Spock's got really big ears.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.420
Which I have out in the garage.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.940
You own Spock ears?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.560
Want to dig 'em up?

04:39.580 --> 04:42.170
Impress Andy? Come on.

04:56.180 --> 04:58.730
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.607
That's not easy to do.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.380
Is something wrong?

05:06.570 --> 05:10.761
Well... I need to talk to you about something.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.540
I saw you at the other night.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.360
Kissing Jessi.

05:19.590 --> 05:20.670
I'm sorry.

05:20.690 --> 05:23.320
Don't. No, you don't need to apologize.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.490
The two of you have shared so much.
You have a unique bond.

05:26.510 --> 05:29.320
It's not that surprising that
you'd be attracted to each other.

05:29.340 --> 05:31.290
It is, to me.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.873
I mean, Jessi's always been really important to me, but...

05:35.893 --> 05:37.837
these new feelings...

05:37.857 --> 05:39.790
I just don't how to deal with them.

05:39.810 --> 05:44.450
Feelings are confusing for ordinary
teenagers living in separate houses.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.830
It's so much more complicated
for the two of you.

05:47.850 --> 05:49.810
So, what do we do?

05:49.830 --> 05:52.130
You may not like it, but

05:52.150 --> 05:56.120
you and Jessi live here together,
as part of our family.

05:56.140 --> 05:59.520
And for you to pursue that kind of relationship,

05:59.540 --> 06:02.342
well, it's just not appropriate.

06:02.710 --> 06:06.440
I'm sorry, Kyle. I haven't set this
kind of boundary with you before.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.981
It won't happen again.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.500
Thank you.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.080
I don't want either of you to be hurt.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.730
And you know how fragile Jessi is.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.450
Hey. Just signed for this.

06:23.870 --> 06:25.250
What is it?

06:27.370 --> 06:30.453
The label not clear enough for you?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.180
Nate?

06:35.920 --> 06:37.386
I've got a new project for you.

06:37.406 --> 06:38.260
Oh, yeah?

06:38.280 --> 06:40.440
I want you to team up with Kyle.

06:41.170 --> 06:42.360
Seriously?

06:42.380 --> 06:45.640
Yeah. It's the formula for a growth accelerant.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.510
We've been trying to crack it for months.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.690
The two of you can make some headway.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.720
I don't want to work with him.

06:51.740 --> 06:52.890
Ask Jessi.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.980
No, that ain't gonna happen.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.399
I need someone I can trust.

06:58.410 --> 07:01.350
Besides, play nicely with Kyle,

07:01.370 --> 07:04.467
and you might make progress with
that chick you're seeing.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.964
I'll e-mail you the assignment.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.290
Police are still searching for any clues

07:32.310 --> 07:35.290
that may shed light on the murder
of a hunter found in the woods

07:35.310 --> 07:37.780
near Victor Falls almost a month ago.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.630
The victim's throat was crushed.

07:39.650 --> 07:41.820
So far, police have no motive for the killing

07:41.840 --> 07:43.950
and no suspects have been named.

07:48.650 --> 07:50.727
Come on, people, move it along.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.840
I thought you were open for business.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.870
That's right. My business.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.750
- We were just...
- Tell you what.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.470
Sibling benefit.

08:00.490 --> 08:02.764
Ten minutes. Start slurping.

08:06.590 --> 08:10.250
This may be one of the few places
we can be alone together.

08:10.270 --> 08:12.950
- Jessi?
- What?

08:13.080 --> 08:16.520
Did you listen in on me and Nicole this morning?

08:16.540 --> 08:20.820
Yes, and I don't think it's any of her business.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.700
We live in her house.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.843
We're part of her family.

08:25.470 --> 08:29.326
So kissing me meant nothing to you?

08:33.330 --> 08:35.668
Of course it meant something to me.

08:35.850 --> 08:39.220
Then how could you not want to be together?

08:39.240 --> 08:44.450
Kyle when you kissed me, I felt such
a rush through my entire body.

08:44.470 --> 08:46.390
Didn't you feel it?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.420
Is it me, or are you getting a vibe?

08:52.440 --> 08:56.830
Trying not to. But they're definitely sitting
at least two inches closer than they used to.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.010
- You don't think they're...?
- Oh...

08:58.030 --> 08:59.470
God, I don't wanna talk about it.

08:59.490 --> 09:01.090
Can we talk about something else?

09:01.110 --> 09:02.600
Absolutely.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.930
So how goes things with you and Nate?

09:05.950 --> 09:08.590
- Good.
- That's great.

09:10.530 --> 09:12.116
You don't like him.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.500
I don't really know him.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.100
How well do you?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.670
It's still really new.

09:19.260 --> 09:21.850
I guess he doesn't talk about himself too much.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.100
I don't want to dump on what could
be a really good thing for you.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.850
I just want you to be careful.

09:25.870 --> 09:27.910
Make sure you can trust this guy, that's all.

09:27.930 --> 09:31.050
- Amanda. Hey.
- Nate. Hi.

09:31.190 --> 09:32.690
- How's it going?
- Good.

09:32.710 --> 09:36.340
- Good. Is Kyle around?
- Kyle?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.400
He's back there. Why?

09:38.420 --> 09:40.908
I just want to partner up on a project with him.

09:40.928 --> 09:44.770
Oh, well. That's really nice.

09:44.790 --> 09:47.883
- Well, uh, see you later?
- Yeah.

09:57.410 --> 09:59.633
Am I interrupting anything?

10:01.340 --> 10:02.560
No.

10:02.580 --> 10:06.080
So Cassidy's got something for us
to work on together. You up for it?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.550
You and me?

10:07.690 --> 10:10.455
Why didn't Cassidy ask me to work with Kyle?

10:12.350 --> 10:15.103
I don't know. He doesn't like you.

10:19.610 --> 10:21.020
Well?

10:24.330 --> 10:26.210
- Fine.
- Good.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.865
You'll have another chance to impress me.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.540
We can't be together at Latnok either.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.210
We can't let Cassidy know we suspect anything.

10:34.230 --> 10:36.220
We can't cause any trouble.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.930
If he wants me and Nate to work together,
we have to go along with it.

10:40.290 --> 10:42.420
Time's up. Get out.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.427
Hey. You're home early. Where's Kyle?

10:53.447 --> 10:56.150
- At Latnok, without me.
- Oh.

10:56.270 --> 10:57.551
Nicole?

10:57.571 --> 10:59.410
I'm not as fragile as you think.

10:59.430 --> 11:02.340
- Oh, Jessi...
- You don't understand how much Kyle means to me.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.195
I know how close you feel to him.

11:04.215 --> 11:07.710
No. Nobody cares about me like he does.

11:07.860 --> 11:11.530
No one makes me feel as happy or as safe.

11:11.690 --> 11:14.150
I need that. I need him.

11:14.170 --> 11:17.123
Jessi, Kyle can still be there for you.

11:17.143 --> 11:22.417
But while you're both living in this house,
he can't be with you, not in that way.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.570
I need to know why you have a problem with Jessi.

11:30.863 --> 11:34.360
She, uh... She was poking around in here the other day.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.800
I think she may have broken into my safe.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.680
Why would she do that?

11:38.880 --> 11:41.000
I was hoping you could tell me.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.370
I don't know anything about it.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.580
Well, did you know that after
your mother's car accident,

11:46.600 --> 11:48.800
Jessi said to me

11:48.820 --> 11:54.425
that if I ever harmed you or
your family, she'd kill me.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.120
She was just being protective.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.558
She could never do anything like that.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.390
Really?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.670
Jessi's a good person.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.420
She's lucky to have a friend like you.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.820
I'm just not sure you know
who you're really dealing with.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.690
Is that all?

12:16.330 --> 12:17.970
Yeah.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.040
You scared me.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.914
I owe you a few.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.730
What are you doing?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.880
Reading you.

12:41.050 --> 12:42.350
What?

12:42.370 --> 12:46.197
I know the look when a girl has a boy on her mind.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.200
What?

12:50.220 --> 12:54.250
You tell me. You can't keep those
kinds of secrets in this house.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.906
Kyle kissed me.

12:59.926 --> 13:01.630
- Ew...
- Ew?

13:01.650 --> 13:03.960
Wait a second, clarify.
Did he actually kiss you?

13:03.980 --> 13:06.460
- Or did you throw yourself at him?
- He kissed me.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.160
There was no throwing involved.

13:11.370 --> 13:14.010
Why does everyone think that's so wrong?

13:14.030 --> 13:18.230
Because it's Kyle, of the pure and beautiful soul.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.060
We only want what's best for him.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.330
Which means not me.

13:21.350 --> 13:22.830
- No.
- Get out.

13:22.980 --> 13:24.720
Get out!

13:31.093 --> 13:34.004
Oh God, I hate myself sometimes.

13:34.024 --> 13:35.840
Why do I say cruel things to people?

13:35.860 --> 13:38.480
Uh, to Declan, Hillary or Jessi?

13:38.500 --> 13:40.450
Jessi was the lucky recipient.

13:40.470 --> 13:42.180
But I couldn't help it.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.700
Am I supposed to ignore that the two of
you were huddled up at The Rack?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.570
- Huddled up?
- We were just talking.

13:47.590 --> 13:50.110
- Sharing secrets.
- Lori.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.400
What kind of secrets?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.760
Have anything to do with Latnok?

13:56.970 --> 14:00.270
Yes. Most of the students there have been great.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.210
It's Cassidy I need to know more about.

14:02.230 --> 14:04.470
So I have to make him believe I'm on his side.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.210
You need an olive branch.

14:06.230 --> 14:07.490
An overture.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.230
Ask him out to dinner.

14:09.530 --> 14:11.110
Invite him here.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.340
If you want him to believe he's winning you over,

14:13.360 --> 14:15.389
a dinner invitation from your parents...

14:15.409 --> 14:16.525
I'd like to meet this guy anyway.

14:16.545 --> 14:18.620
No, I don't want him in this house.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.636
Kyle, you're not doing this unless we're part of it.

14:23.770 --> 14:26.262
- You and Josh shouldn't be here.
- But I wanna be.

14:26.910 --> 14:29.283
You make Cassidy too uncomfortable.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.570
Why is everybody shutting me out?

14:32.590 --> 14:34.340
I haven't done anything wrong.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.430
- Jessi...
- You don't want me around either.

14:36.450 --> 14:37.740
You know that's not true.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.470
You know what? I won't bother any of you anymore.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.870
You'd better leave the door open.

15:03.970 --> 15:09.100
You know, what we're doing with
Cassidy is all about you.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.570
I'm trying to figure out why Sarah was killed,

15:14.590 --> 15:17.000
and I need him to trust me.

15:17.160 --> 15:21.467
So if he wants to drive a wedge
between us, we have to let him.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.200
I just hate how everyone's looking
at me like I'm this horrible person.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.160
Nobody in the family does.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.690
And you shouldn't care what Cassidy thinks about you.

15:34.640 --> 15:39.030
Fine. Have your dinner. I'll stay away.

15:44.780 --> 15:47.651
Jessi, I need to know that you're committed to this.

15:48.070 --> 15:50.730
I have to trust that you can keep things under control.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.510
Don't you know me well enough to be sure?

15:54.050 --> 15:56.880
I just don't want any surprises.

16:02.140 --> 16:05.300
Lori, I need you to help me with something.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.930
But you'll have to keep it a secret.

16:06.950 --> 16:09.860
Espionage? All over it.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.620
So what's my mission?

16:11.640 --> 16:13.620
I need to know more about Cassidy.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.920
I think we should adjust the floor value here.

16:18.057 --> 16:20.060
Too many ideal elements.

16:20.191 --> 16:23.443
The algorithm lost stability about three adjustments ago.

16:23.676 --> 16:25.040
You're right.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.432
Easy to miss.

16:28.828 --> 16:30.600
Apparently, not for you.

16:30.968 --> 16:34.131
Cassidy teamed us up.
He must think you can contribute.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.946
Cassidy just wants us to get along.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.960
I know he supervises everything,

16:38.980 --> 16:41.190
but have you ever seen him report to anybody?

16:41.339 --> 16:43.030
Why do you ask?

16:43.050 --> 16:44.250
Curious.

16:44.270 --> 16:48.359
Well, I have no idea who he answers to.

16:48.850 --> 16:53.246
All those senior Latnok guys,
they're all cloak and dagger, minus the dagger.

16:53.870 --> 16:55.250
Right.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.140
So, what do we got?

17:03.610 --> 17:08.097
Maybe if we adjust the values
in this sequence here...

17:16.710 --> 17:17.940
That's it.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.810
Cassidy's had people working on this
for months and you solved it.

17:22.829 --> 17:24.040
Just like that.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.089
We solved it.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.790
I guess we're done.

17:34.210 --> 17:35.680
Kyle!

17:37.340 --> 17:39.030
I wanted to thank you.

17:39.210 --> 17:40.310
For what?

17:40.430 --> 17:42.240
For making an effort with Nate.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.120
It means a lot to me.

17:44.890 --> 17:47.580
I just want you to be happy, Amanda.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.030
I want the same for you.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.830
So, what's this big surprise?
G-Force marathon?

18:18.990 --> 18:20.790
Give me more credit than that.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.880
Well, show me already.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.520
Not yet. Still gotta kick out a couple of paying customers

18:25.540 --> 18:28.430
so I can reap benefits that come
with minimum wage authority.

18:28.450 --> 18:31.467
Ooh, it turns me on when you go crazy with power.

18:31.487 --> 18:33.190
Just give me a minute.

18:35.420 --> 18:38.141
Whatever it is, he hasn't stopped working on it.

18:38.830 --> 18:42.919
Yeah, he's such a cute worker bee
when he puts his mind to something.

18:42.939 --> 18:44.928
All right, guys, time's up.

18:47.610 --> 18:51.316
Makes me sad to think his ambition might stop when I leave.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.544
I don't know about that.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.161
He's already offered to take half
of my shifts next week.

18:57.350 --> 19:00.713
I think he wants to stay busy
so he doesn't miss you as much.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.870
I'm sorry, did I say something?

19:06.480 --> 19:09.290
No, it's fine. It's just...

19:11.180 --> 19:13.320
My moms changed our plans.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.480
We're not leaving in three days.

19:16.210 --> 19:18.580
We're leaving in the morning.

19:19.690 --> 19:21.960
And Josh doesn't know?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.440
This is our last night together.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.460
Mrs. Trager, I presume.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.833
- Mr. Cassidy.
- It's Michael, please.

19:39.853 --> 19:40.900
These are for you.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.550
Oh. They're beautiful.

19:42.570 --> 19:43.530
Please, come in.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.620
Thank you.

19:45.750 --> 19:46.750
Stephen Trager.

19:46.770 --> 19:47.880
Pleasure, sir.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.710
Kyle, how you doing, man?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.350
- Hey, dude.
- Hello.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.340
It smells, uh, ridiculously delicious in here.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.920
Don't let that fool you.

19:56.380 --> 19:57.550
Can I get you a drink?

19:57.670 --> 19:59.092
I'd love one. Thank you.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.880
You know what it is?

20:14.130 --> 20:16.220
Give a girl a minute.

20:16.370 --> 20:20.120
The lights, like little stars,

20:20.590 --> 20:22.920
shiny surfaces.

20:23.070 --> 20:27.350
It feels very... futuristic.

20:27.570 --> 20:30.550
An interesting observation, Miss Jensen.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.580
Oh, my God.

20:34.970 --> 20:36.690
I love Star Trek.

20:38.230 --> 20:41.270
I wanted to give you something really special.

20:44.430 --> 20:45.910
You did.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.730
So you know what to do?

20:47.750 --> 20:49.170
The mission is clear.

20:49.190 --> 20:50.940
You love this, don't you?

20:50.960 --> 20:54.246
Nothing like a little intrigue and
reconnaissance to light up the night.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.380
Here they come. Hey!

20:58.620 --> 20:59.720
Sorry. Too much?

20:59.740 --> 21:02.869
Yeah, a little. A tad. Just, uh, act natural.

21:03.980 --> 21:08.270
Hey, we just bumped into each other.

21:08.290 --> 21:09.760
So did we.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.750
I mean, we were both here waiting for you, separately.

21:13.770 --> 21:18.270
And then we decided to sit at this table.
Here at The Rack.

21:18.470 --> 21:22.947
And we're all here now,
so you guys want to hang out for a few?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.250
Um, OK.

21:26.780 --> 21:29.240
- Great.
- Fantastic.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.150
Hi.

21:35.550 --> 21:36.740
This is wonderful.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.960
Thank you.

21:38.110 --> 21:41.370
I haven't had a good home-cooked meal in
I don't even know how long.

21:41.390 --> 21:43.540
Where is home, Mr. Cassidy?

21:43.859 --> 21:45.570
Brooklyn.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.380
OK.

21:50.430 --> 21:52.490
Uh, England. East London.

21:52.510 --> 21:54.200
Little town called Hackney.

21:54.348 --> 21:55.940
Still have family there?

21:56.070 --> 21:57.723
We've scattered.

21:58.220 --> 22:01.290
But I love Seattle. And my work keeps me busy, so...

22:02.320 --> 22:04.640
So Kyle tells us you're not a scientist.

22:04.770 --> 22:08.000
No. I'm definitely missing that gene.

22:08.170 --> 22:10.750
So, what exactly is your contribution at Latnok?

22:11.090 --> 22:12.740
I foster.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.390
I encourage.
Basically, I'm a professional nag.

22:15.410 --> 22:17.340
Kyle can attest to my persistence.

22:17.484 --> 22:18.987
Yes, I can.

22:19.275 --> 22:22.637
I think we'd all like to hear
what's expected of Kyle.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.340
Jessi, what are you doing here?

22:27.360 --> 22:28.600
I live here.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.990
I thought you had plans to be out tonight.

22:31.130 --> 22:32.550
I changed my mind.

22:32.570 --> 22:35.240
Well, we were just having dinner.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.970
Great. Is there a place for me?

22:39.590 --> 22:40.980
Of course there is.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.610
I'll get you a plate.

23:01.830 --> 23:04.760
So it must be exciting to have two minds
like Kyle's and Jessi's in the mix.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.560
Oh, thrilling! Thrilling.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.560
Kyle's a natural-born leader.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.680
And Jessi shows great potential.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.080
This brownie is amazing.

23:26.595 --> 23:29.861
So good you want to save some for later.

23:34.110 --> 23:35.980
My cobbler's pretty great.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.390
Want some?

23:38.110 --> 23:40.340
Trager doesn't eat cooked fruit.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.820
So, what are you guys doing later?

23:47.660 --> 23:49.910
Whatever it is, we can't go back to my house.

23:50.030 --> 23:51.200
I've been banished.

23:51.220 --> 23:54.460
Your boss, Cassidy, is over for dinner
with Kyle and my parents.

23:54.610 --> 23:56.140
He's not our boss.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.160
I thought he called the shots.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.860
Oh, I get it. What happens at Latnok, stays at Latnok.

24:06.020 --> 24:08.100
That's right, top secret.

24:08.120 --> 24:11.060
No, come on, I mean we like to keep the details confidential,

24:11.080 --> 24:16.860
but... I think I can trust you.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.530
Cassidy's in charge,
but we have tons of freedom.

24:22.550 --> 24:25.860
He knows when to help and when to get out of our way.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.010
So you like working with him?

24:28.030 --> 24:29.220
He's fine.

24:29.330 --> 24:31.910
Yeah, whatever. He's, um...

24:32.070 --> 24:35.191
- You know, we should get going if we're gonna catch a movie.
- No!

24:35.860 --> 24:38.989
I mean, I wanna try some of your cobbler.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.600
You used to dream about Mr. Spock?

24:49.780 --> 24:52.400
Oh, in my mind, we were dating.

24:52.780 --> 24:54.690
I was only 12, rember?

24:54.710 --> 24:55.910
It was innocent.

24:56.090 --> 25:01.610
We'd do things like eat cotton candy and
play foosball at the International Space Station.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.941
Three days before you leave, and...

25:04.961 --> 25:07.810
you pull out this great goofy stuff.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.410
Josh...

25:11.190 --> 25:12.860
Thank you.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.370
For what?

25:16.460 --> 25:19.925
I just don't think I've said it enough.

25:20.958 --> 25:22.981
You've been so great.

25:23.450 --> 25:26.120
I haven't been the typical first girlfriend

25:26.140 --> 25:28.922
and you've always been there for me.

25:29.130 --> 25:31.370
Through everything.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.249
And I have to tell you...

25:33.269 --> 25:35.980
Whoa. Stop.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.710
No heartfelt goodbyes.

25:39.086 --> 25:41.260
We still have plenty of time for that.

25:41.430 --> 25:43.830
- Yeah, but...
- No buts.

25:44.030 --> 25:49.070
Tonight is about you and me
in our own private universe.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.640
You want to go where no man has gone before?

25:53.830 --> 25:56.420
Or just once before?

25:56.660 --> 25:58.684
How long have you been waiting to say that?

25:59.133 --> 26:01.320
All night long.

26:09.820 --> 26:15.773
Michael, you know, Kyle and Jessi
share very unusual backgrounds.

26:15.910 --> 26:18.182
Two peas in a pod, so to speak.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.711
We've tried to keep their lives very private.

26:21.850 --> 26:25.000
My biggest concern is that
they always stay protected.

26:25.020 --> 26:26.650
Absolutely.

26:26.900 --> 26:30.742
Look, my apologies for Latnok's
regrettable actions on prom night.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.630
Regrettable is putting it mildly.

26:32.650 --> 26:34.090
Fair enough.

26:34.290 --> 26:36.750
But let me assure you, from this point forward,

26:36.900 --> 26:40.640
Kyle and Jessi's well being is
always at the forefront.

26:40.890 --> 26:43.169
You know what I'd like to hear about?

26:43.480 --> 26:45.120
My mother.

26:45.550 --> 26:46.500
Jessi.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.837
What? He must know Sarah.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.540
Certainly I've heard of her.

26:50.682 --> 26:51.930
Brilliant woman.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.810
Oh, so you've never met?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.640
Never had the pleasure.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.190
Really?!

26:58.340 --> 27:00.200
Jessi, you know she's been in hiding for years.

27:00.220 --> 27:01.840
She wants nothing to do with Latnok.

27:01.860 --> 27:02.880
That's right.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.960
She didn't trust you.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.870
She never met me.

27:08.890 --> 27:12.540
It's Latnok she had... has a problem with.

27:14.450 --> 27:17.020
Nate and I finished that project for you.

27:17.630 --> 27:20.790
So soon? Great. You must be working well together.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.390
He was very helpful.

27:22.410 --> 27:23.930
What was the project about?

27:23.950 --> 27:27.000
We don't know anything about this guy
and he's here having dinner.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.110
- Jessi.
- He doesn't trust me?

27:29.130 --> 27:30.516
I don't trust him.

27:30.536 --> 27:31.840
Jessi, please.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.586
He's done terrible things.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.980
What are you talking about?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.310
You're a liar!

27:36.330 --> 27:38.100
You have secrets.

27:41.150 --> 27:45.420
Maybe we should tell this family about
the secret you've been keeping from them.

27:48.487 --> 27:50.360
I think it's beholden upon me

27:50.380 --> 27:53.510
to tell you what sort of person
you have living under your roof.

27:56.770 --> 27:59.910
You remember that first night, don't ya Jessi?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.600
After the explosion...

28:04.890 --> 28:07.440
...you found your way out of the pod

28:07.820 --> 28:09.810
and left ZZYZX.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.430
You took a little wander in the woods.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.900
You came across a man camping.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.750
No.

28:19.270 --> 28:20.840
A stranger to you.

28:20.860 --> 28:22.800
Please stop.

28:22.820 --> 28:25.070
And you killed him.

28:30.650 --> 28:33.850
An hour out of the pod, and she murdered someone.

28:34.660 --> 28:37.660
I'm afraid that's the sort of person that she is.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.700
It's in her nature.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.550
Jessi, what is he saying?

28:49.910 --> 28:52.340
I have the news reports.

28:52.810 --> 28:55.600
- The murder's still unsolved.
- I didn't murder him.

28:55.780 --> 28:57.850
- He had a knife.
- Then it's true?

28:57.870 --> 29:00.720
No. I was alone. I was scared.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.849
He tried to attack me.

29:02.990 --> 29:05.760
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not a killer!

29:06.950 --> 29:09.730
I'm not a killer.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.860
Jessi! Jessi!

29:13.080 --> 29:14.300
Wait!

29:32.460 --> 29:34.540
I'm terribly sorry.

29:35.277 --> 29:37.110
I hate to drop news like that on you.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.950
I just can't believe it.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.910
It's a lot to take in.

29:40.930 --> 29:42.740
But I do feel I had to tell ya.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.410
We've been concerned about Jessi for quite some time.

29:45.600 --> 29:49.080
Knowing that she's here with your family now...

29:51.360 --> 29:54.169
I don't think any of us want someone so...

29:54.520 --> 29:58.060
...unpredictable getting closer to Kyle.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.820
Are you OK?

30:01.410 --> 30:03.920
She was so upset.

30:05.250 --> 30:07.590
I just hope she's all right.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.860
This is why he's extraordinary.

30:11.290 --> 30:13.900
He's only concerned about her.

30:16.730 --> 30:20.920
So is it off-limits, or can you tell us
what you're working on at Latnok now?

30:22.770 --> 30:24.160
Unbelievable.

30:24.180 --> 30:27.400
What's with this super perky friendly routine?

30:28.770 --> 30:32.020
I'm showing interest. I'm being nice.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.310
That's so not like you.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.390
It's sweet that you're trying to connect
with me as Declan's ex-girlfriend.

30:38.580 --> 30:40.810
See? I'm sweet.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.350
I'm trying to connect.

30:42.530 --> 30:46.600
And in answer to your question,
I've got a bunch of new ideas,

30:46.620 --> 30:48.720
but too soon to discuss.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.670
You have to run them by Cassidy?

30:51.650 --> 30:54.230
Why all this interest in Cassidy?

30:54.830 --> 30:57.900
I just want to get a sense of your life.

30:58.130 --> 31:00.960
- Oh.
- I don't like him.

31:01.430 --> 31:03.450
He didn't want me to date you at first,

31:03.470 --> 31:05.290
and he didn't exactly threaten me,

31:05.310 --> 31:08.930
but we got pretty close to Don Corleone territory.

31:09.830 --> 31:12.770
- The guy creeps me out.
- How weird.

31:18.010 --> 31:23.110
Kyle, I know tonight didn't work out the way we'd hoped.

31:23.260 --> 31:25.260
We all want the best for Jessi.

31:25.280 --> 31:28.820
But clearly, she's a very troubled girl.

31:29.250 --> 31:33.590
And you've spent an excessive amount of time being her anchor.

31:33.610 --> 31:35.380
That has got to be draining.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.060
She's my friend.

31:37.190 --> 31:39.430
I'd do anything for her.

31:40.306 --> 31:42.315
You're a good man.

31:43.090 --> 31:46.756
I just don't want her instability
jeopardize your future.

31:47.320 --> 31:51.080
- We never had a chance to talk about that...
- I'd still like to.

31:51.421 --> 31:53.745
Maybe we can meet later.

31:54.582 --> 31:55.963
That would be wonderful.

31:56.127 --> 31:57.398
The Rack?

31:57.418 --> 31:58.929
Half an hour?

31:59.106 --> 32:00.651
Sounds like a plan.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.550
OK, the coast is clear.

32:13.570 --> 32:16.000
I always pictured the fairy-tale
ending to the perfect date

32:16.020 --> 32:18.451
as me climbing through your sister's window.

32:18.590 --> 32:22.196
I wish I could beam you up to
maintain the theme of our evening.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.440
Anyway, let's move.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.600
Yes, sir.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.470
He's coming.

32:32.955 --> 32:34.089
Dad!

32:34.651 --> 32:36.797
- Hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

32:36.933 --> 32:39.089
Is Star Trek night over already?

32:39.280 --> 32:41.598
What happened? Did you get mopey again?

32:41.890 --> 32:44.200
No, it was great. You were right.

32:44.220 --> 32:47.810
Andy loved the whole super-galactic send-off.
Genius idea.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.605
Well, then why...?

32:51.590 --> 32:53.155
Let me explain.

32:53.580 --> 32:56.122
Josh, I can't believe that you...

33:00.040 --> 33:01.885
...look so tired.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.360
I'll go tell your mother that you're home

33:05.380 --> 33:08.770
and that you're going straight to bed.

33:15.770 --> 33:17.520
To sleep.

33:28.780 --> 33:30.480
So this is it.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.650
My domain.

33:31.670 --> 33:35.570
Wow. You must study a lot.

33:36.470 --> 33:38.720
So is someone studying more.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.348
Why do you make everything a competion?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.540
Wow. Direct.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.919
Sorry.

33:45.939 --> 33:47.990
No, I think I need that.

33:48.010 --> 33:49.840
You should call me on my stuff. It's good.

33:49.979 --> 33:51.250
Can I get you anything?

33:51.510 --> 33:53.180
I could use a soda.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.390
Machine's right downstairs.

34:25.659 --> 34:28.290
No Belly Button

34:43.440 --> 34:45.060
Your beverage, milady.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.639
Thank you.

34:47.350 --> 34:48.639
You OK?

34:48.954 --> 34:50.489
Fine.

34:53.449 --> 34:54.760
Hello?

34:55.780 --> 34:57.730
Is anyone here?

35:00.250 --> 35:01.600
Kyle?

35:06.360 --> 35:09.700
Jessi. Where is everyone?

35:09.890 --> 35:12.450
We closed early.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.620
I don't know what it is you want.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.030
The truth.

35:26.150 --> 35:28.080
I know you killed Sarah.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.580
Why?

35:29.849 --> 35:31.760
Sarah left.

35:31.981 --> 35:34.510
Now I'm sorry she couldn't handle being your mother.

35:34.530 --> 35:37.020
Don't you dare speak of her that way.

35:37.410 --> 35:40.850
She didn't leave me, you killed her.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.468
You need help.

35:42.488 --> 35:45.580
Actually, I think you do.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.090
See what's happening to the water?

35:51.320 --> 35:53.350
I can do that to you.

35:56.350 --> 35:59.660
I can manipulate the blood flow in your body.

36:00.120 --> 36:03.290
- What?
- I can target certain areas

36:03.310 --> 36:06.391
and make the vessels expand and contract.

36:06.411 --> 36:09.230
- Jessi, listen...
- Why did she have to die?

36:10.060 --> 36:12.540
I suggest that you answer me.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.270
You don't want to accept that Sarah left.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.110
I had nothing to do with it!

36:26.680 --> 36:28.460
What are you doing?

36:30.750 --> 36:33.220
Stop! Don't!

36:35.068 --> 36:36.930
- Don't
- Jessi!

36:38.025 --> 36:39.470
You need to calm down.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.680
He murdered my mother!

36:41.858 --> 36:43.590
Stay out of it.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.880
It didn't happen that way.

36:52.510 --> 36:53.910
What are you saying?

37:00.210 --> 37:01.480
You want the truth?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.050
Sarah attacked me.

37:03.070 --> 37:05.100
- What?
- She saw me that night!

37:05.120 --> 37:06.420
She knew I was Latnok.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.940
She was gonna kill me.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.220
She lost it! I was protecting myself. I had no choice.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.430
You're lying.

37:12.810 --> 37:14.640
I can tell that you're lying.

37:14.770 --> 37:16.409
It makes no sense.

37:16.614 --> 37:19.810
Jessi! You need to tell her what's going on.

37:26.210 --> 37:28.060
Baylin's experiment.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.500
Prolonged gestation in a pod.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.710
We're starting it up again.

37:30.730 --> 37:32.050
The experiment.

37:32.220 --> 37:33.720
Why would you do that?

37:33.840 --> 37:35.710
I'm looking at the reason.

37:36.350 --> 37:38.210
You're a success.

37:38.810 --> 37:40.590
Sarah found out.

37:41.996 --> 37:43.818
She didn't approve.

37:43.838 --> 37:45.630
So you killed her!

37:45.650 --> 37:47.310
You took everything from me!

37:47.330 --> 37:49.333
My mother! And now Kyle!

37:49.353 --> 37:52.470
Jessi! Jessi, don't!

37:52.630 --> 37:55.440
You know what I did.
You can't even look at me anymore.

37:55.460 --> 37:56.600
That's not true.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.480
We can get through this.

37:58.660 --> 38:00.800
No. It doesn't matter anymore.

38:00.950 --> 38:03.491
- I'm already a murderer.
- No!

38:10.420 --> 38:12.490
Jessi? Jessi?

38:13.070 --> 38:15.590
Jessi. Speak to me.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.200
- Kyle, she's...
- No, don't say it!

38:35.200 --> 38:38.070
Jessi. Jessi!

38:38.720 --> 38:40.799
Please. It didn't work.

38:41.017 --> 38:43.235
Jessi, please! Breathe!

38:43.770 --> 38:45.520
Kyle, I got nothing, man.

38:45.650 --> 38:47.100
I got nothing.

38:47.271 --> 38:49.193
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

38:49.507 --> 38:50.800
Oh, my God.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.160
- We gotta get out of here.
- I won't leave her.

38:52.180 --> 38:53.970
Come on, Kyle, you can't be here.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.590
You can't be here, man.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.250
Jessi, I'm sorry.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.100
They're gone.

39:23.210 --> 39:24.880
You all right?

39:24.900 --> 39:28.400
I slowed my heartbeat down to two beats per minute.

39:29.389 --> 39:32.614
And it was strangely relaxing.

39:33.176 --> 39:35.308
You better go.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.740
Nicole's waiting for you at home.

39:40.910 --> 39:43.739
Do you think we convinced Cassidy?

39:44.200 --> 39:46.630
He'll send people to clean up the mess.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.190
Won't they tell him they didn't find my body?

39:49.880 --> 39:52.450
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

40:08.870 --> 40:10.020
Jessi?

40:14.220 --> 40:16.655
I'm so happy you're home.

40:21.310 --> 40:22.640
Are you all right?

40:22.760 --> 40:24.070
Oh, I'm fine.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.730
Kyle explained the trick you were pulling on Cassidy.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.744
I just wished I'd known about it from the beginning.

40:28.881 --> 40:30.575
We didn't want to worry you.

40:30.712 --> 40:33.715
That part of your plan was unsuccessful.

40:35.860 --> 40:41.110
Nicole, I'm really sorry I didn't tell you
about what happened to me that night.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.040
No. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

40:44.174 --> 40:45.937
And the way I reacted...

40:45.957 --> 40:48.820
Jessi, you know you can always count on me.

40:48.980 --> 40:53.610
I was just so surprised, hearing it like that.

40:53.730 --> 40:57.270
Well, that's why I decided to tell Kyle before.

40:57.844 --> 41:00.673
When we were planning all this, he said "No surprises."

41:00.840 --> 41:04.680
And that was the one secret I never shared.

41:05.628 --> 41:07.200
So I told him.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.750
And he understood.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.930
He always does.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.150
So how did it go at The Rack?

41:15.291 --> 41:16.970
Just like we wanted.

41:17.150 --> 41:20.695
Well, I don't like that Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.

41:21.050 --> 41:23.130
Kyle can handle him.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.590
<i>We had fooled Cassidy,</i>

41:26.610 --> 41:28.960
<i>and he revealed my biggest challenge:</i>

41:28.980 --> 41:31.570
<i>Latnok was re-starting Adam's experiment.</i>

41:31.770 --> 41:33.980
<i>I had to stop them.</i>

41:34.110 --> 41:36.160
<i>I had to keep up the charade.</i>

41:36.820 --> 41:38.630
It was an accident.

41:39.070 --> 41:41.710
- You know that thing?
- That doesn't change what happened.

41:41.730 --> 41:43.720
She was gonna kill me.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.579
You saved my life.

41:46.490 --> 41:50.710
Kyle, I promise I will take care of this.

41:50.730 --> 41:52.530
I will take care of you.

41:53.610 --> 41:57.490
But you need to pull it together. Go home.

41:58.180 --> 42:01.860
Tell them you met with me, but you never saw Jessi.

42:02.270 --> 42:05.040
Look at me. Look at me.

42:07.640 --> 42:10.890
I'll make sure there is no trace of what happened.

42:11.342 --> 42:14.410
This never happened.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.050
As far as anyone's concerned, Jessi ran away

42:18.070 --> 42:20.020
and she's not coming back.

42:20.190 --> 42:21.770
Do you understand?

42:24.520 --> 42:26.280
Yes.

42:28.570 --> 42:31.380
We're in this together now, Kyle.

42:32.180 --> 42:36.710
And together, there is nothing that we can't do.

42:37.570 --> 42:39.750
But we need to trust each other.

42:40.550 --> 42:42.620
