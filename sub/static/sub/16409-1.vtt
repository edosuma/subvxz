Von Konig is a very popular man.

58:13.757 --> 58:15.146
Where are you exactly?

58:15.226 --> 58:17.195
VISSER: The north entrance
of the fault line.

58:17.294 --> 58:21.026
Elke must be Kreisau Circle,
and I may have found their stronghold.

58:21.131 --> 58:24.422
- Are you sure?
- It's heavily guarded.

58:24.502 --> 58:26.528
I would certainly need
reinforcements to engage.

58:26.637 --> 58:28.926
- Are you on your way, Sturmbannfuhrer?
- Yes.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.669
I'm gathering my men.
We are about to leave.

58:33.544 --> 58:36.100
Now, if you have found
the Circle's stronghold,

58:36.180 --> 58:38.602
that would mean von Konig
must be there as well.

58:38.682 --> 58:40.137
Yes, Sturmbannfuhrer.

58:40.217 --> 58:42.306
And that would explain
the American presence here.

If von Konig ends up in Berlin
with information from Elke,

The US raid on Konigsberg is imminent.

he is just a friend of the West?

59:57.227 --> 59:59.594
My duty is to my wife and our children,

59:59.697 --> 01:00:02.963
and towards those dedicated
to the same cause I'm dedicated to.

I understand your concerns, Major Kulkov,

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:24.616

while Stalin was preoccupied.

the assassination attempt took place,

But with Hitler alive, everything changed.

will be sought out and executed.

as many Nazis as I could.
