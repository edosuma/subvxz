WEBVTT

01:15.040 --> 01:16.280
<i>Benji?</i>

01:16.600 --> 01:18.364
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>

01:19.200 --> 01:20.531
<i>Benji?</i>

01:21.880 --> 01:23.882
- Shit.
<i>- Where is Ethan?</i>

01:24.640 --> 01:25.801
Uh, I can't talk right now.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.726
<i>The package is on the plane.</i>

01:28.800 --> 01:30.370
Yeah, I know.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.286
<i>We're currently formulating a plan B.
Although, technically, it's a plan C.</i>

01:34.440 --> 01:36.044
This isn't going very well.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.009
<i>I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.</i>

01:38.080 --> 01:40.651
- Where's Ethan?
- I don't know. We're on radio silence.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.331
That plane cannot take off
with the package on it.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.400
- Do you understand?
<i>- We're working on it.</i>

01:45.520 --> 01:47.727
Luther?
What the hell are you doing there?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.484
<i>You're supposed to be
on assignment in Malaysia!</i>

01:49.560 --> 01:51.244
I am in Malaysia.
I've been here two days.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.243
- Benji needed my help.
- I didn't need help.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.800
I needed assistance.
It's a different thing.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.240
The package is still on the plane.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.449
<i>We understand the package
is on the plane.</i>

02:01.520 --> 02:03.807
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that?

02:04.040 --> 02:06.646
We can if the pilot left
the satellite uplink switched on.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.846
Which he has.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.402
- And how do you access the uplink?
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.324
- I can't authorize that.
- Which is why I didn't ask permission.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.086
We're under investigation
for misconduct.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.367
The package is on board.
What do you want me to do?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.045
Uh, Luther.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.044
I'm reading a heat bloom,
Benji.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.282
- The engines are starting.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.246
<i>But I can't do anything
until I'm connected to the satellite.</i>

02:38.200 --> 02:39.326
Benji, you're connected.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.606
Okay, great.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.485
The package is still on that plane.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.880
<i>Shut down the fuel pump.</i>

02:46.600 --> 02:48.489
Uh, the mechanicals
are locked down.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.001
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.321
Uh, no.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.283
- Hydraulics!
<i>- Okay, stand by.</i>

02:54.440 --> 02:55.930
No, they're encrypted.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.001
Benji, the plane!

02:59.080 --> 03:01.367
Yes! The package is on the plane!
We get it!

03:04.120 --> 03:05.281
Can you open the door?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.611
Ethan? Where are you?

03:07.760 --> 03:10.331
<i>I'm by the plane.
Benji, can you open the door?</i>

03:10.440 --> 03:12.807
Uh, can I open the door? Uh, maybe.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.009
Open the door when I tell you!

03:29.760 --> 03:31.364
<i>I'm on the plane. Open the door.</i>

03:31.480 --> 03:32.561
<i>How did you get in the plane?</i>

03:32.640 --> 03:35.291
<i>Not in the plane.
I'm on the plane!</i>

03:35.600 --> 03:37.329
Open the door!

03:42.080 --> 03:43.889
Benji! Open the door!

03:44.440 --> 03:45.805
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay!

03:51.320 --> 03:53.440
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I'm trying!

04:08.720 --> 04:10.360
- Come on, Benji!
- Benji, open that door!

04:11.640 --> 04:12.687
Come on! Come on!

04:18.839 --> 04:20.046
Come on!

04:20.120 --> 04:21.201
Yes, got it!

04:26.960 --> 04:28.405
That's the wrong door!

04:28.480 --> 04:30.209
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.520
The other door, right!
Yes, the other door.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.688
Okay, yes! Sorry, my bad, my bad!

04:40.880 --> 04:41.961
Check it out.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.366
All right, look, I'm gonna open
the para door! How's that?

05:15.240 --> 05:16.480
Hey! Hey!

06:32.160 --> 06:33.810
We're about to close.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.411
I won't be long.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.167
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.368
Something rare.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.570
Let me guess.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.561
Classical.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.685
- Jazz.
- Sax?

06:52.160 --> 06:54.083
- Coltrane.
- Piano?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.161
Monk.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.081
Shadow Wilson on bass.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.322
Shadow Wilson played drums.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.568
Know why they call him Shadow?

07:04.040 --> 07:06.441
Because he had a light touch.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.811
You're in luck.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.528
I have a first pressing.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.730
It really is you.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.206
I've heard stories.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.924
They can't all be true.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.924
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

07:54.000 --> 07:57.800
<i>The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas</i>

07:57.880 --> 07:59.723
<i>capable of devastating a major city.</i>

08:00.680 --> 08:02.170
<i>The bodies of the air crew were found</i>

08:02.240 --> 08:05.084
<i>less than 24 hours
after they landed in Damascus.</i>

08:05.240 --> 08:08.323
<i>They were identified as
low-level Chechen separatists</i>

08:08.400 --> 08:10.243
<i>with neither the access nor the ability</i>

08:10.320 --> 08:12.448
<i>to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.</i>

08:13.480 --> 08:15.005
<i>This would support your suspicion</i>

08:15.080 --> 08:18.368
<i>that a shadow organization
is committed to inciting revolution</i>

08:18.440 --> 08:22.081
<i>by enabling acts of terror
in nations friendly to Western interests.</i>

08:22.600 --> 08:25.604
<i>IMF suspects this to be
the same shadow organization</i>

08:25.680 --> 08:27.842
<i>you have been tracking for the last year,</i>

08:27.920 --> 08:29.809
<i>also known as the Syndicate.</i>

08:30.280 --> 08:32.361
<i>IMF would be right.</i>

08:32.760 --> 08:34.808
<i>Normally, you and your team
would be tasked</i>

08:34.880 --> 08:37.884
<i>with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network.</i>

08:37.960 --> 08:41.601
<i>But we have taken steps to ensure
that this will not happen.</i>

08:41.679 --> 08:44.285
<i>Because we are
the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt.</i>

08:44.360 --> 08:46.601
<i>And now we know who you are.</i>

08:47.120 --> 08:50.841
<i>Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to face your fate.</i>

08:51.120 --> 08:55.205
<i>Pursue us, you will be caught.
Resist us, you will be killed.</i>

08:55.280 --> 08:59.251
<i>And your precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.</i>

08:59.360 --> 09:00.646
<i>Good luck, Mr. Hunt.</i>

09:00.720 --> 09:03.371
<i>This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

09:54.680 --> 09:57.445
<i>Mr. Chairman,
the IMF's misadventures date back</i>

09:57.520 --> 09:59.363
to my earliest days at the CIA

09:59.440 --> 10:03.923
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.123
And now, more recently,
a Russian warhead?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.281
Disarmed Russian warhead.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.840
- A Russian nuclear warhead...
- Rendered safe by the IMF.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.689
...clipped the Transamerica Pyramid

10:11.760 --> 10:13.603
before plunging into
the San Francisco Bay.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.650
- Saving the western hemisphere.
- This made possible by IMF agents

10:16.760 --> 10:20.685
who did willingly provide
the launch codes to a known terrorist.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.160
Do I have that right, Agent Brandt?

10:24.120 --> 10:26.122
I can neither confirm nor deny details

10:26.200 --> 10:28.282
of any such operation
without the Secretary's approval.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.204
This was the same week that the IMF
infiltrated the Kremlin.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.645
Here is the Kremlin before

10:34.720 --> 10:36.324
and the Kremlin after.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.924
I can neither confirm nor deny details
of any operation...

10:42.000 --> 10:43.764
Without the Secretary's approval,
yes, we know.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.161
In fact, until this panel appoints
a new Secretary,

10:46.240 --> 10:48.686
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?

10:48.760 --> 10:50.250
Well, I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.085
Mr. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Force

10:53.160 --> 10:55.288
is not just a rogue organization.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.285
It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency

10:59.360 --> 11:00.920
- and without oversight.
- Mr. Chairman?

11:00.960 --> 11:03.531
- Time has come to dissolve the IMF...
- Mr. Chairman?

11:03.640 --> 11:07.008
...and transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.084
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.845
- Mr. Chairman?
- Are its methods unorthodox? Yes.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.844
Are its results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.571
- But without the IMF...
- There will be order and stability!

11:18.640 --> 11:20.005
Without the IMF...

11:21.920 --> 11:26.881
This panel recognizes
the IMF's contribution to global security.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.328
But the events laid out
by CIA Director Hunley

11:30.440 --> 11:33.364
also show a pattern
of wanton brinksmanship

11:33.440 --> 11:36.284
and a total disregard for protocol.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.125
From where I sit,
your unorthodox methods

11:39.200 --> 11:41.567
are indistinguishable from chance.

11:41.640 --> 11:46.726
And your results, perfect or not,
look suspiciously like luck.

11:48.160 --> 11:52.165
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.090
What are you doing here?

13:34.720 --> 13:35.721
Hmm?

13:38.920 --> 13:41.207
I said, what are you doing here?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.129
What does he see in you, I wonder?

13:52.400 --> 13:53.606
Who is "he"?

13:58.080 --> 14:00.003
I want to see what he's made of.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.287
Well, why don't you
take off the cuffs and I'll show you,

14:06.280 --> 14:07.441
Vinter?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.210
You know who I am.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.124
Janik Vinter.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.970
They call you the Bone Doctor.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.806
The funny thing is,

14:22.840 --> 14:26.208
you were officially declared dead
three years ago.

14:26.880 --> 14:27.927
Nice shoes, by the way.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.641
Not his.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.960
Yours.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.723
Our instructions were to break him down...

14:43.360 --> 14:44.959
...not kill him.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.247
Some guys break different than others.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.170
This one's a fighter.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.728
He'll die before you turn him.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.920
Are you worried
he's going to take your place?

15:07.440 --> 15:11.047
You should go before it gets ugly.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.403
Yeah, he's right. You should go.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.409
So now let's see how tough you are.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.171
Janik.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.367
We've never met before, right?

17:05.760 --> 17:06.761
Follow me.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.281
Give me the gun!

17:20.680 --> 17:23.001
- What are you doing?
- I can't leave.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.169
You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.806
We didn't kill them, you did.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.281
I tried to stop you. You got away.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.806
Who are you?

17:34.480 --> 17:36.801
You better hurry now. Good luck.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.961
No, wait! Wait!

17:39.160 --> 17:40.241
Where is he?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.920
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.651
Run. He's getting away. HURRY.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.401
- Satcom seven.
<i>- Western Europe unsecured.</i>

18:00.640 --> 18:02.802
- Designator?
<i>- Bravo-Echo-1-1.</i>

18:02.880 --> 18:03.881
Connecting.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.842
- This is Brandt.
<i>- Go secure.</i>

18:08.760 --> 18:09.761
Go.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.844
<i>London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.</i>

18:13.000 --> 18:15.924
Agent in place is down.
Request immediate extraction.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.650
What happened?
Who breached London?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.490
<i>Do you have anything to go on?</i>

18:19.560 --> 18:20.686
A face.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.442
<i>He wanted something. Not information.
He could've killed me.</i>

18:25.040 --> 18:26.087
But he didn't.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.723
- Okay. What do you think it means?
- The Syndicate is real.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.846
They know who we are, how we operate.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.925
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.561
Just focus operations on gathering
any available intel regarding

18:39.680 --> 18:41.091
former covert operatives.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.242
It doesn't matter
what country or agency,

18:43.320 --> 18:45.607
just as long as they're dead
or presumed dead.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.047
Start with Janik Vinter.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.168
<i>He's also known as the Bone Doctor.</i>

18:50.240 --> 18:51.401
I can't do that.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.762
What? What are you talking about?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.682
The Committee has shut us down.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.367
Operations have been handed over
to the CIA.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.965
<i>There is no more IMF.
I've been ordered to bring everyone in.</i>

19:05.640 --> 19:07.369
<i>- Ethan...</i>
- I understand.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.284
<i>- Ethan...</i>
- I understand, Brandt.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.090
We didn't have this conversation.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.446
I've disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.484
<i>If I'm dead or alive.</i>

19:16.640 --> 19:18.130
This man you saw, can you find him?

19:20.240 --> 19:22.242
I won't stop until I do.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.006
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.931
Make it count.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.560
Brandt?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.684
<i>Since we're going
to be working together,</i>

19:50.760 --> 19:52.800
<i>I want you to choose
your next words very carefully.</i>

19:53.040 --> 19:54.166
Where is Hunt?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.203
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.806
I have no way of contacting him.
He's deep cover.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.723
Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

20:01.040 --> 20:05.284
Let's cut the bull. You know who we are,
you know what we're capable of.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.044
How come the CIA has never discovered

20:07.120 --> 20:09.805
any actionable intel
regarding this, uh, Syndicate?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.851
- What are you implying?
- Not implying. Stating.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.127
Leveling an accusation, actually.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.409
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.326
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination,

20:21.400 --> 20:24.244
created to justify the IMF's existence.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.041
I am going to find him, Brandt,
and when I do,

20:27.160 --> 20:28.844
he will be called upon to answer for

20:28.920 --> 20:32.242
every wanton act of mayhem
he is responsible for.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.490
Welcome to the CIA.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.649
You'll never find him.

20:40.760 --> 20:45.322
Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt
is living his last day as a free man.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.849
All right, everybody, heads up! This is it.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.770
<i>Alpha team prepped, standing by.</i>

21:05.840 --> 21:06.841
Execute.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.924
Langley, Brimstone. Go.
I say again, we are go.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.761
<i>Langley, there's nobody here.</i>

22:15.200 --> 22:18.283
Langley, Brimstone.
Face the north wall.

23:25.800 --> 23:26.961
Dunn.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.046
Is it that time already? Okay.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.280
I will ask you
a series of control questions.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.044
I know,
and I'm gonna answer truthfully,

23:37.120 --> 23:39.487
and then you're gonna ask me
to lie intentionally.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.961
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.001
See, that's a lie.

23:44.560 --> 23:47.643
I'm actually third in line to the throne.
My brother was...

23:47.960 --> 23:49.405
Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.480
Why would he contact me?

23:50.520 --> 23:51.601
Hunt has resurfaced.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.205
This time in Cuba.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.370
He, uh, left these behind.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.324
Tell me what you make of them.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.802
I don't know.
He's taken up scrapbooking?

24:01.880 --> 24:03.245
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.126
All of them are either missing or dead.
Every one.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.204
All of them were government agents.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.408
Russian, French, British, Israeli,
you name it.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.727
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no trouble collecting them.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.121
And he always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.651
I wonder how.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.720
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
- Oh, the thought had crossed my mind.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.644
Six months I have been here,

24:23.720 --> 24:27.884
sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

24:27.960 --> 24:32.124
I have decrypted, processed, parsed
more data than anyone in my section.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.083
And yet, every week you haul me in here

24:34.200 --> 24:37.044
and you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.970
And today you haven't answered it.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.563
You seem to think
I have some kind of obligation to him.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.686
Okay. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

24:48.760 --> 24:51.684
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,

24:51.840 --> 24:54.605
and I am stuck here answering for it.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.164
We are not friends.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.681
I owe him nothing.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.443
That'll be all, Dunn.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.402
<i>Welcome to Vienna, Benji. Miss me?</i>

26:09.720 --> 26:12.041
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

26:12.120 --> 26:14.009
You know what?
Please, don't tell me that.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.050
Because it's just another thing I'll have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.122
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.
Just keep walking.</i>

26:19.200 --> 26:21.282
<i>But make sure
you're not being followed.</i>

26:21.360 --> 26:23.328
I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.811
<i>No, I'm afraid not.</i>

26:24.880 --> 26:26.280
- So, where do we meet'?
<i>- We don't.</i>

26:26.520 --> 26:28.280
<i>For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.</i>

26:29.200 --> 26:30.247
<i>You have mail.</i>

26:31.960 --> 26:32.960
- Who is he?
<i>- That's what</i>

26:33.000 --> 26:34.047
<i>we're here to find out.</i>

26:34.120 --> 26:37.329
<i>What I do know is he's our
only possible link to the Syndicate.</i>

26:37.400 --> 26:39.846
<i>And I have reason to believe
he's going to be here tonight.</i>

26:40.280 --> 26:42.851
<i>But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?</i>

26:42.920 --> 26:44.604
- Uh...
<i>- Are you in?</i>

26:44.680 --> 26:46.364
Yes, of course. Of course. Urn...

26:46.880 --> 26:47.961
So what's the play?

26:48.040 --> 26:51.806
<i>Simple. You find him. We tag him.
I follow him wherever he goes.</i>

26:51.920 --> 26:53.081
And after that?

26:53.160 --> 26:54.605
<i>After that, you're on a plane.</i>

26:54.680 --> 26:57.650
<i>Back at work Monday morning.
No one is the wiser.</i>

26:58.160 --> 27:01.289
- Wait, that's it?
<i>- You're in enough danger as it is.</i>

27:01.360 --> 27:03.931
<i>I didn't want to involve you this much,
but I had no choice.</i>

27:04.000 --> 27:05.604
Well, if you're going to bring me
all this way,

27:05.680 --> 27:08.763
you could at least give me something
a bit more, you know, dramatic.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.646
<i>Benji, we're trying to keep a low profile.</i>

27:12.320 --> 27:15.244
<i>You want drama, go to the opera.</i>

27:43.800 --> 27:46.644
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>

27:53.480 --> 27:56.962
<i>Am I correct in assuming
that is the Chancellor of Austria?</i>

27:57.040 --> 27:58.485
Yes, you are.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.324
<i>Did you know
he was going to be here?</i>

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
No.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.410
<i>Right. Well, we have
a European head of state here</i>

28:04.480 --> 28:08.280
<i>at the same time as we are looking
for a nefarious terrorist.</i>

28:08.360 --> 28:11.091
<i>And I'm sure that the two things
are completely unrelated.</i>

28:11.160 --> 28:12.161
Benji.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.810
<i>Meanwhile, I will try and overlook
the fact that</i>

28:13.920 --> 28:16.571
<i>you're an international fugitive
wanted by the CIA!</i>

28:16.640 --> 28:20.008
<i>And that this little unsanctioned
operation is tantamount to treason.</i>

28:20.080 --> 28:23.766
<i>Because, as you stated earlier, I will be
back at my desk on Monday morning,</i>

28:23.840 --> 28:26.411
playing videogames,
and no one will be any the wiser.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.891
- <i>The show's about to start, Benji.</i>
- Right.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.200
<i>Just take your position.</i>

28:29.280 --> 28:30.691
<i>- Tell me what you see.</i>
- Okay.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.171
<i>Nice tux, by the way.</i>

28:52.000 --> 28:54.082
Lights ready, Act One preset.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.559
Final preparations complete.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.846
Everyone standby please.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.246
Join the IMF! See the world!

29:44.560 --> 29:47.245
On a monitor. In a closet.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.011
Okay, I have eyes.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.290
Searching.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.725
Talk to me, Benji.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.290
Nothing yet. Stand by.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.681
I know you're here. Where are you?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.844
Uh, Ethan, I might have
something for you. Can't confirm.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.689
- Where?
- Backstage. I'll direct you.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.084
<i>Take the door on your left.</i>

32:04.280 --> 32:06.009
He should be right in front of you.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.886
Benji, do you see that?

32:48.960 --> 32:50.200
<i>See what?</i>

32:51.000 --> 32:53.731
- That woman.
- What woman? Where are you?

32:53.960 --> 32:55.246
I can't see you.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.602
What was that?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.125
I don't know.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.890
Oh! Ah!

35:29.960 --> 35:31.962
Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in!

37:54.480 --> 37:55.766
Ethan, the lighting booth!

37:55.840 --> 37:57.205
Ethan, do you copy?

39:24.960 --> 39:26.086
It's just a fleshwound.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.731
Seal the building. Close the exits.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.887
I have a way out. Interested?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.810
Lead the way.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.010
- Anything you want to tell me?
- Uh, no, not right now.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.841
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

40:43.480 --> 40:44.766
What's next?

40:48.360 --> 40:49.361
There.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.086
Shoes.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.250
Shoes, please.

41:30.720 --> 41:31.721
Uh...

41:57.760 --> 41:59.283
If anything were to happen to you -

41:59.284 --> 42:01.169
Nothing's going to happen to me.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.480
STOP THE CAR.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.241
Get in!

42:15.520 --> 42:16.726
Go, go, go.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.281
What the... She tried to shoot me!

42:27.600 --> 42:29.523
That doesn't make her a bad person.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.891
I'm going to have to search you.

42:31.960 --> 42:34.566
- You have to let me go.
- Oh. Not a chance!

42:34.640 --> 42:36.400
I assumed you were deep cover
back in London,

42:36.440 --> 42:38.200
but isn't this taking
the role a little far?

42:38.240 --> 42:39.730
Hang on a minute.
Do you know her?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.245
We haven't been formally introduced,

42:41.320 --> 42:43.687
but I'm pretty sure
she's British intelligence?

42:43.960 --> 42:46.122
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.691
And that shade is very hard to find.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.331
What were you doing
at the opera tonight?

42:52.400 --> 42:53.925
Aside from killing the Chancellor.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.367
Saving your life in London
put me in a tight spot

42:56.440 --> 42:58.408
with some very dangerous people.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.680
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.530
Ah, so you admit that you killed him!

43:02.640 --> 43:05.723
I went through the motions.
That's not the same thing.

43:05.840 --> 43:07.490
You thought you'd put him
in the hospital,

43:07.560 --> 43:08.925
take him out of harm's way.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.081
Same thing you tried to do.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.561
You're not going to
believe that, are you?

43:11.640 --> 43:13.005
What about the rest of her team?

43:13.080 --> 43:14.923
You mean those other two idiots.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.764
I can only assume
they were redundancies.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.889
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

43:21.000 --> 43:22.445
the other one to kill you.

43:22.840 --> 43:25.730
- A test.
- Second one I've failed, thanks to you.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.201
And the car bomb was insurance.

43:32.680 --> 43:33.886
Uh, we have a tail.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.651
Who is he?

43:38.160 --> 43:40.288
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

43:40.360 --> 43:43.125
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you have to let me out.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.281
Uh, they're closing!

43:46.080 --> 43:48.731
This has to look like an escape,
so you just throw me out anywhere.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.245
Tell me who he is.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.367
Whoa!

43:53.560 --> 43:55.403
Change of plan! Throw her out!

43:57.840 --> 43:59.729
You have everything you need
to find me.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.320
<i>Less than 24 hours</i>

44:17.360 --> 44:19.283
<i>after we interviewed Benji Dunn
about Ethan Hunt,</i>

44:19.920 --> 44:22.764
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.764
And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.207
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,

44:28.280 --> 44:31.250
but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.322
Consider for the moment
the possibility that

44:33.440 --> 44:35.841
Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,

44:35.920 --> 44:37.570
and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!

44:37.640 --> 44:41.770
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.447
The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.681
You mean shoot to kill.

44:48.160 --> 44:52.210
Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.361
New identity.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.921
Passport, cash, move map.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.286
There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.006
Everything you need
to make it to DC. undetected.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.209
Once you're there,
you have to inform on me.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.888
- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth.

46:04.960 --> 46:07.804
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.451
I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.000
- You refused.
- That's not the truth!

46:12.080 --> 46:14.447
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.761
It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear.

46:16.840 --> 46:20.367
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

46:28.440 --> 46:29.885
You recognize anyone?

46:43.200 --> 46:44.281
Him.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.408
He's former KSA. German intelligence.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.050
Missing, presumed dead.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.969
He was at the opera tonight.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.451
This one, too.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.285
Former Mossad.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.010
Let me guess. Presumed dead.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.770
Tonight, I made it official.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.927
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.482
The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.569
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

47:09.560 --> 47:12.450
hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

47:12.520 --> 47:14.761
with 236 passengers.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.889
I just missed him in the Philippines

47:17.960 --> 47:20.167
right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant

47:20.240 --> 47:22.208
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.121
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.890
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.611
That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.282
That wreck triggered a civil war.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.890
These are no accidents.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.126
They're links in a chain.

47:46.200 --> 47:49.443
The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.647
A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,

47:52.720 --> 47:54.404
imbued with a new sense of purpose.

47:54.480 --> 47:58.451
Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.890
An anti-IMF.

48:02.480 --> 48:06.166
Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.766
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,

48:08.840 --> 48:10.490
the start of a new phase.

48:11.040 --> 48:14.681
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.321
He was there.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.006
Every time.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.321
Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.290
I don't know who he is, where he's from,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.923
how he's funded.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.843
But I know he's the key.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.800
Ethan, this is what I signed up for.
Let me help you find him.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.689
That's why I brought you here
in the first place,

48:36.760 --> 48:38.285
and look what happened!

48:38.360 --> 48:39.805
I can't protect you.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.162
That's why I need you to leave.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.811
That's not your decision to make, Ethan!

48:45.560 --> 48:48.131
I am a field agent. I know the risks.

48:48.200 --> 48:49.850
More than that, I am your friend,

48:49.920 --> 48:51.888
no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.930
Now, you called me
because you needed my help.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.321
And you still do. So I am staying.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.521
And that is all
we are going to say about that.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.721
Okay.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.087
Good.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.041
Where do we start?

49:13.240 --> 49:14.401
Ilsa.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.048
Right. And how do we find her?

49:19.560 --> 49:21.608
She said we have everything we need.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.608
We had an agreement.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.127
You send me to do a job, I do it.
But my way, not yours.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.565
Where did I deviate?

50:08.640 --> 50:10.642
You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.926
One of them tried to kill me.

50:12.320 --> 50:13.481
You missed.

50:13.560 --> 50:16.211
I missed because Ethan Hunt was there
looking for you.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.648
Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because
you allowed him to escape in London.

50:19.720 --> 50:22.929
Vinter would have killed him in London,
and that's not what you asked for.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.286
Twice now you've let him slip away.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.126
Curious.

50:29.440 --> 50:32.364
Are you questioning my loyalty
or my ability?

50:33.840 --> 50:37.731
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before, trust me or kill me.

50:38.280 --> 50:40.009
But if you're going to kill me, be a man.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.765
Do it yourself.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.049
Did he say anything?

51:15.480 --> 51:17.448
He knows about Morocco.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.689
What does he know about Morocco?

51:20.320 --> 51:24.166
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

51:25.800 --> 51:27.006
Find him, please.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.285
He'll find me.

51:31.560 --> 51:33.164
I've seen to that.

51:38.400 --> 51:39.731
That's interesting.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.325
- What is it?
- It's a skiff.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.244
A secure computer facility.
Offline, ultra-contained.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.283
It's impossible to hack into
from the outside.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.931
It's essentially
a digital safety deposit box.

51:49.040 --> 51:52.362
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.920
Where's it located?

51:54.000 --> 51:55.126
Uh...

51:55.200 --> 51:56.281
Morocco.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.600
Morocco.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.080
And what brings you gentlemen
to Casablanca?

53:48.920 --> 53:50.081
Good to see you.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.481
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

53:54.440 --> 53:57.011
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

53:57.080 --> 53:59.765
We believe that
Ethan and Benji were there.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.163
Hunley has handed this over
to the Special Activities Division.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.606
We need to find Ethan before they do.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.205
And that's where you come in.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.765
Not interested.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.683
- Okay, look, Luther...
- Look, man, I know Ethan.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.200
I don't know you.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.930
All I know about you
is that you chose to work for Hunley.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.526
Yeah. All I know about you
is you chose to resign.

54:25.040 --> 54:29.443
You don't have to worry
about Ethan. They'll never catch him.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.284
No, they're not gonna catch him. No.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.761
This is the CIA.
This is Hunley we're talking about.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.969
Things are out of control.
No, they're going to kill him.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.611
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

54:41.360 --> 54:44.091
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

54:51.520 --> 54:53.249
You need to understand something.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.884
Ethan is my friend.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.049
And if I have one second of doubt
whose side you're on...

55:02.200 --> 55:03.326
Mmm?

55:04.720 --> 55:06.165
I believe you.

55:07.880 --> 55:09.769
- All right.
- All right.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.887
What do I have to go on?

55:11.800 --> 55:14.485
Not much. And not a lot of time.

55:16.920 --> 55:18.445
<i>His name Solomon Lane.</i>

55:19.720 --> 55:20.960
He created the Syndicate.

55:21.680 --> 55:22.761
Where does he come from?

55:24.200 --> 55:25.884
He's former British intelligence.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.681
Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,

55:29.760 --> 55:31.842
why don't they just tell the CIA?

55:31.920 --> 55:33.684
Because they don't want
anyone knowing

55:33.760 --> 55:36.730
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.331
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust

55:40.440 --> 55:43.683
and eventually identify the members
of his organization.

55:43.760 --> 55:47.924
And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.285
Lane had a ledger.

55:50.360 --> 55:54.445
It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,

55:54.560 --> 55:57.245
the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.

55:57.320 --> 56:00.369
One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,

56:00.440 --> 56:04.570
and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.371
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

56:07.440 --> 56:09.169
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.886
So the key to crushing Lane

56:13.960 --> 56:16.964
is sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it.

56:18.080 --> 56:21.448
So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?

56:22.240 --> 56:23.526
Oh, he has.

56:24.120 --> 56:25.645
He sent me.

56:26.680 --> 56:27.806
And I can tell you

56:29.480 --> 56:30.811
it's impossible.

56:35.040 --> 56:38.522
The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.364
And the only way to download the ledger

56:40.480 --> 56:43.324
is through the central
computer terminal, located there.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.120
<i>To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gate,</i>

56:48.880 --> 56:51.042
<i>access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,</i>

56:52.840 --> 56:55.320
<i>and open
three separate combination locks.</i>

57:01.280 --> 57:03.169
<i>Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent</i>

57:03.240 --> 57:06.005
who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!

57:29.160 --> 57:31.686
Unfortunately, even if you could
make it through

57:31.800 --> 57:34.610
every other security measure,
you won't beat the last one.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.281
<i>That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.</i>

57:37.360 --> 57:39.567
<i>The step beyond facial recognition.</i>

57:39.680 --> 57:42.206
<i>These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,</i>

57:42.280 --> 57:43.884
<i>how he talks, how he moves.</i>

57:44.320 --> 57:46.209
<i>Right down to his facial tics.</i>

57:54.040 --> 57:56.120
<i>So, what you're saying is
no mask can beat it.</i>

57:56.200 --> 57:57.440
We're busted before we even get
into the vault,

57:57.520 --> 57:58.885
and I wind up in a Moroccan jail,

57:58.960 --> 58:01.566
playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.210
Okay, I don't get to wear a mask.

58:03.760 --> 58:05.364
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

58:05.440 --> 58:06.680
No other way in.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.922
- Air shaft?
- Six-inch-diameter pipe.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.040
Foundation?

58:10.080 --> 58:11.889
Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom.

58:12.880 --> 58:13.847
- Electrical conduit.
- Electrical conduit.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.604
Bottom line is there's no way
into that terminal

58:15.720 --> 58:19.008
unless your profile is preinstalled
in the security system.

58:20.880 --> 58:22.086
Profile.

58:22.960 --> 58:24.160
Where are the profiles stored?

58:24.560 --> 58:28.326
All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.922
Here, inside the torus.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.441
Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?

58:33.760 --> 58:35.046
- Yes.
- Yes.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.327
Okay. So, to get the ledger,

58:38.640 --> 58:40.165
<i>one of us needs to enter the torus</i>

58:41.840 --> 58:43.842
<i>and change the security profile,</i>

58:45.920 --> 58:48.844
<i>so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.</i>

58:51.040 --> 58:53.520
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.809
Can I get in through there?
What's that?

58:57.880 --> 59:01.123
That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside.

59:01.440 --> 59:03.040
If you try and open it from the outside,

59:03.080 --> 59:06.209
you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.406
Where does the water come from?

59:07.520 --> 59:10.888
Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.

59:10.960 --> 59:14.009
And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automatically

59:14.080 --> 59:16.003
if any metal enters the intake.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.561
No oxygen tanks.

59:21.400 --> 59:24.131
All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swim

59:24.200 --> 59:25.770
from the intake to the service hatch?

59:25.840 --> 59:27.808
Two minutes,
with the current at full power.

59:27.880 --> 59:30.040
Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.210
What about installing
the security profile?

59:32.280 --> 59:34.408
Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops.

59:34.480 --> 59:36.280
So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes.

59:36.480 --> 59:37.641
You can do that.

59:37.760 --> 59:39.842
What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.970
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

59:43.120 --> 59:46.681
Don't worry about him, all right?
All he has to do is install the fake profile

59:46.760 --> 59:50.242
before I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.209
That doesn't sound impossible.

59:56.720 --> 59:59.530
Satellite overwatch
covering all seven continents.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.241
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.966
So, how are we supposed to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.091
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.531
What do you mean?

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.126
These sketches. What do you see?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.721
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guy is.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.206
But this woman...

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.602
- He knows her.
- He trusts her.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.960
I'm betting that if he's not already
with her, he's on his way.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.565
Find her, find Ethan.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.080
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition off a sketch.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.764
For mere mortals, no.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.889
- For me, I could've done this at home.
- All right.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
- How long is this gonna take?
- Found her.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.562
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.445
What the hell?

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.491
She's bad news.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.961
Sorry.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.720
Your card isn't working.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.440
<i>Benji, we're in.</i>

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.361
One more time.
You'll have three minutes.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.330
Two and a half minutes
to switch the security profile.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.721
Thirty seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.283
Remember, conserve oxygen.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.283
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.684
I'm in the elevator.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.926
That current will carry you
to the torus.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.729
Once you're there, I'll shut it down.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.406
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.802
And a slightly more important note.
If you haven't switched that profile

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.400
before I reach the gait analysis,
I'm dead.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.331
Thank you, Benji.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.086
What's the problem?

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.369
The cooling system's rebooting by itself.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.921
All systems normal.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.164
Cooling system's at full power.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.368
No, no, no.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.205
You're all right.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.645
Oh, you're okay.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.930
You see? What did I tell you?

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.771
Difficult? Absolutely. But certainly not...

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.525
Jesus. Is he all right? What happened?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.731
Okay.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.921
Here.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.006
Hey.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.685
I misjudged you.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.602
Hey, man. You okay? How you doing?

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.280
Hey, buddy.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.444
- Benji.
- Yeah, Benji. You did good.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.082
You take a moment, all right?
Just take a moment.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.731
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.882
- You'll be right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.921
Look, look.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.527
We got it.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.525
I knew we'd get it.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.450
Listen, I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay?

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.488
I appreciate everything you do for me,

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.370
but one of these days,
you're going to take it too far.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.245
We got it!

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.681
We're gonna nail that...

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.370
Wait, wait...

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.450
I thought you said
you could find him.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.766
I said I could locate him.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.649
- You have to find him.
- Right.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.565
Where's Hunt?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.001
He's dead.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.765
That really hurts!

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.046
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.851
We have to get to
her before Lane does.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.521
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.729
Are you okay to drive?
A minute ago you were dead.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.446
What are you talking about?

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.005
This is not going to end well.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.160
There she is!

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.851
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.849
Ah! God damn it!

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.601
Whoa.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.041
We found him.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.721
Oh, come on, man!

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.481
Shit!

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.086
It's a high-speed chase!

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.402
You just had to get the four-by-four,
didn't you?

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.165
- Don't blame me. You chose the car.
- You just had to have it!

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.561
- Do you want me to drive?
- Look at this thing!

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.520
Look how slow you're going.
Speed it up!

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.921
Who's this guy?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.161
Shit!

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.641
Oh!

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.086
Ahhh!

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.561
Go! Go! Go!

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.290
I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay!

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.761
Whoa!

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.686
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.971
Here they come!
What are we gonna do?

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.081
Uh...

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.921
Gun!

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.166
- Do you have your seatbelt on?
- You're asking me that now?

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.685
Hang on!

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.481
We good?

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.567
Things got a little out of hand.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.729
Ah! Look out!

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.086
We're good?

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.045
Oh, hey, boys, what did I miss?

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.360
Ooh, that looks sharp. Careful! Careful!

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.441
So what do we do now?

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.489
Please tell me
you made a copy of that disk.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.048
Of course I made a copy.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.485
So where are we going?

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.448
It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.010
Who they are,
the politicians they control,

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.402
and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.087
What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.251
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.482
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.088
Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.646
Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.370
It's what he's trained to do.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.569
Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.803
Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.040
This may be authentic.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.844
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.600
No.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.044
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.770
Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.003
that we may learn more
about them firsthand.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.527
This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.001
The only way to pass is to go back.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.170
I can't do that. I've betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.720
And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.451
He was going to torture and kill
an American agent.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.922
And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.162
This is the trade. Hunt understands that.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.686
I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.845
There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.289
As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.931
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.683
Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.081
Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.845
Lane will order you.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.205
And to regain his trust,

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.370
you will do it.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:49.763
You sent me to do a job. I did it.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.529
Now you bring me in!

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.285
Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.323
The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.727
Of course, to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.370
So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.284
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.443
Precious few people know
about your true identity.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.809
It would be unfortunate if we forgot.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.806
You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.850
You're going back.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.167
Glad to know you're still with us.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.282
- What's happening?
- I can't open it.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.247
- What do you mean, you can't open it?
- I mean I can't open it, ever.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.924
That's a red box.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.684
- A what?
- It's a red box.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.320
The British government uses them
to transport state secrets.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.320
- Doesn't sound good.
- Meaning it's triple-encrypted.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.526
You're not getting into that thing

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.648
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan,

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.088
and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.168
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:06.401
Yes, him.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.608
So what you're saying is
there is no ledger,

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.081
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.687
So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.169
I'm so proud of us.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.641
What I don't understand is
why is there a red box

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.206
sat in a private data vault in Morocco?

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.962
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.930
If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.080
And we just helped him steal it.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.970
He's going to take the Prime Minister.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.364
Yes, he is. The question is how.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.085
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.321
Yeah, MI6.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.244
No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.322
We have a responsibility
to warn the British government

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.609
and not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.129
just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.124
Is that what you think this is?

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.001
Brandt?

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.410
Is that what you think this is?

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.082
I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.801
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.123
And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna all over again!

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.441
You don't know him.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.524
If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.523
That's why we have to warn the British.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.841
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.321
Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.727
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.121
before he takes the Prime Minister.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.281
Okay.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.808
All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.444
But please tell me
how are we going to do that?

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.766
All is forgiven.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.089
That isn't a ledger, is it?

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.124
You didn't take a look for yourself?

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.251
Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.410
And why would I lie to you?

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.488
So that I would lie to Hunt.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.605
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.923
And you wouldn't have helped him.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.604
What is actually on that disk?

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.969
I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.001
Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.841
Hmm?

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.925
You're still alive
because I believe in your potential.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.889
But I'm growing impatient.

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.522
Why do you continue to resist?

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.487
Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.486
If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:25.724
But my method is far more surgical.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.650
You kill innocent people.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.124
I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.884
So much more.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.042
Killing to keep things as they were.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.650
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:45.161
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.400
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
And one day his luck will run out,

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.970
and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.842
Which one of us will be the villain then?

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.127
Nothing here. It's empty.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.610
I'm interested to see who you blame

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.410
for what happens next.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.121
So that's her?

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.606
That's her.

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:23.604
I have to say you sure can ride.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:29.002
- Ethan...
- You were just doing your job.

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.920
That's all we're going to say about it.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.730
Atlee said you would understand.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.491
Atlee.
Your handler in British intelligence.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.283
And he didn't bring you in,

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.690
even after you gave him the disk.

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.201
You knew perfectly well it was blank.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.201
<i>That's a lie.</i>

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.760
The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm sure of it.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.207
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.131
They don't care if you live or die.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.881
But you knew
I was going to take it to him.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.849
I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That means
Lane doesn't have the disk. Only we do.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.401
I have a question.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.962
If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.882
<i>Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her.</i>

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.571
So who you working for now?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.641
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.964
We only think
we're fighting for the right side

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.929
because that's what
we choose to believe.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.125
So where does that leave us?

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.086
The way I see it,
you have three choices.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.649
One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.964
I am proof the Syndicate exists.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.323
Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.562
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.800
But you know
they're not gonna believe you.

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.129
And you'll all be tried for treason.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.041
Lane goes free.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.090
I'm afraid she has a point.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.648
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.331
You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.244
But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:33.051
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.724
whether you want to or not.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.970
That is entirely possible.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.001
And option three?

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.131
Come away with me.

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.165
Right now.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.130
Oh, boy.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.006
And what about Lane?

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:56.130
Forget about Lane.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.684
There will always be another Lane.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.965
There will always be people like us
to face him.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.163
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.162
We can be anyone.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.682
We can do anything.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.682
It's only a matter of going.

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:31.764
Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.000
I've saved your life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.170
What's the message?

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.361
Benji.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.565
Parking garage.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.290
Luther, stay with her!

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.722
She's gone. I lost her.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.725
She set us up, Ethan.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.403
No. She delivered a message.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.370
She set us up!
She knew this would happen!

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.284
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen!

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.043
<i>I have a job for you, Ethan.</i>

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.805
<i>And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.</i>

01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.921
I'm listening.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.049
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:05.727
<i>is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight tonight.</i>

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.450
<i>Now say the words, please.</i>

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.210
I accept.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.361
Yes.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.520
I knew you would.

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.648
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight.

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.169
Ethan, there's only one person on Earth
who can unlock that disk.

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.002
We have to take the Prime Minister.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.482
Let's just think about that
for a minute.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.241
It's the only way to get Benji back.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.164
Ethan, that's exactly
what Lane wants you to do.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.651
Which is why it has to happen.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.329
This is how we beat Lane.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.004
This is how we make everything right.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.606
Can you see?

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.365
Can't you see it?

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.363
William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.442
I had a feeling
you'd come to your senses, Brandt.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.121
I'm only calling you
because I have no other choice.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.884
I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.883
<i>I can understand that. Where are you?</i>

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.204
- London.
- Reroute us to London now.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.291
- Where in London?
<i>- I'll tell you when you land, not before.</i>

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.482
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.445
And I'm not interested
in seeing my friends get killed either.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.921
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going do this on my terms

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.809
and my terms only. Do you understand?

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.247
<i>Keep your phone on.
Instructions will follow.</i>

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.329
You should've been gone
by now.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.401
Yeah.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.131
You okay?

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.681
We're supposed to take down

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.480
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain tonight.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.881
So...

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.087
Brandt?

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.040
I can't see another way.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.891
Neither can I.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.205
But we do what we have to do
for our friends, right?

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.486
Get him ready, please.

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.168
You were right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.129
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.965
- What does he intend to do?
- What matters is that he's alive.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:58.010
And I need your reassurance
that he's going to stay that way.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.844
Have you informed
the British government

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.809
that Hunt has targeted
the Prime Minister?

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.327
I will help you capture him alive.
That is the deal.

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.841
You've picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt,

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.447
the worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.930
Stay with him.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.161
Chief Atlee! Chief Atlee.

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:45.561
Director Hunley,
how delightful to see you here.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.486
Last time we spoke, you were hunting
rogue agents in Morocco.

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.531
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:57.920
I'm listening.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.762
Any advance
on 22,000? Anyone?

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.322
Going once. Going twice.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.042
Sold to our generous chairwoman.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.644
Sir? Chief Atlee from MI6
needs to see you.

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.250
He says it's urgent.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.325
Excuse me.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.250
What's this all about?

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.561
It's a matter of national security, sir.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.651
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter.

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.081
Yes, sir.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.280
<i>Help me to understand.</i>

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.891
Who is this man?
Why is he after me?

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.725
I'm afraid, Prime Minister,
Director Hunley and I

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:56.041
share responsibility for this.

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.124
Ethan Hunt was part of
a disgraced intelligence agency

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.480
which has since been dissolved.

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.851
And he's gone rogue,

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.527
unfortunately intent on dismantling
an imaginary terror network.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.167
But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulated

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.083
by one of your own former agents.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:13.050
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared two years ago.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:16.926
If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.084
Uh, sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.323
He came forward with firsthand
knowledge of the plot against you.

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.085
Sir, Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red box

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.003
that can only be opened by you.

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.527
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:35.083
The Syndicate, you say?

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.005
Yes, sir.
That's what he calls it.

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.007
Atlee?

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.240
He couldn't possibly be talking about

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.686
that Syndicate.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.320
Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.763
And it was, Prime Minister,
I can assure you.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:55.887
And yet here we have

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.122
the Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise.

01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.565
I don't understand.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.768
Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.288
I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.250
Sir, does the name Solomon Lane
ring a bell?

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:11.726
Yes.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.723
Unfortunately, it does.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.880
So there actually is a Syndicate?

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.325
It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.450
Recruit former agents
from other nations,

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.885
supply them with a new identity,

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.726
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.801
Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.924
in a virtual red box
which I alone would control.

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.086
It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.400
with zero accountability.

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.165
I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.925
Furthermore,
I was given every assurance

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.843
it never passed the planning stage.

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:54.491
Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate.

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.081
These men have been duped
by Agent Faust.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.528
Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.330
Sir, I urge you not to leave this room.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.606
- Excuse me.
- Please.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.561
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.008
A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.361
There is no secret he cannot extract.

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.762
No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:20.242
He has, most likely,
anticipated this very conversation

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.210
and is waiting to strike
in whatever direction we move.

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.365
Sir, Hunt is the living manifestation
of destiny.

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.046
And he has made you his mission.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.051
Prime Minister?

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.161
Hunt.

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.247
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.641
Just relax, sir.
Everything's going to be all right.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.326
- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, sir.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.320
Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.165
US-UK relations
to the American Revolution?

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:14.411
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.041
I'm here.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.804
<i>- Stand by to receive.</i>
- Ready.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.840
The Prime Minister's office asked me
to meet him here.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.361
This way, sir.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.760
Scanning.

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.648
Retinal scan confirmed.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.607
Mmm.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.444
It's okay. Here you go, sir.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:46.160
You've got a very warm hand.

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.685
<i>Biometric confirmed.</i>

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.042
The prompt is "Kipling."

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.851
Sir, I'm going to need a pass-phrase.
The prompt is "Kipling."

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.251
Yes, of course.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.848
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs...

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.528
<i>"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."</i>

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.049
- You got it?
<i>- I got it.</i>

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:27.844
Oh, man, do I got it.

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.570
I'm here to see the Prime Minister.

01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.370
We were told not to let anybody in.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.771
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.768
Hunley? What is this?

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.330
Security!

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.286
Chief Atlee.

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.523
Kind of you to accept our invitation.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.921
Ah.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.122
Do you know who I am?

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.488
We know you created the Syndicate.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.927
But Lane went rogue
and turned it against you, didn't he?

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.601
And you've been
desperately trying to cover it up.

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.081
That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.130
That's true.

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.688
Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.411
Namely, how you framed her.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.847
That's also true.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.045
It's the antidote.

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.561
When the Prime Minister found out
about the Syndicate,

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.290
Atlee attacked him.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.566
Yes, that's true.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.371
And then you saved
the Prime Minister, sir.

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.726
Did he?

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.481
I'm very grateful.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.966
Sir.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.280
You're cutting it very close, Ethan.

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.161
I have what you want. Where do I go?

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.729
Ethan, wait.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.928
If I'm not there in 15 minutes,
he'll kill Benji.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.889
The mission
is to bring down the Syndicate.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:38.170
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.322
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.041
And what happens,
Ethan, if you can't make it back?

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.523
I'll make it back.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.091
Just be ready.

01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.530
<i>Greetings, Prime Minister.</i>

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.806
<i>If you are viewing this message,</i>

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.963
<i>it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.</i>

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:03.726
<i>This disk gives you access
to £2.4 billion</i>

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.325
<i>in untraceable currency</i>

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.803
<i>that will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.</i>

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:14.569
<i>Instructions to access these funds
are as follows.</i>

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:23.482
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.006
Careful.

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.730
Two pounds of Semtex.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.687
Five hundred .30 caliber ball bearings.

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.082
Your friend is sitting on
a highly sensitive...

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.730
...pressure trigger.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.844
So no sudden moves.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.526
Your final test.

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.446
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.602
If not, everyone dies.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.365
No time to think, Ethan.

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:13.604
Have a seat, please.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:31.808
Human nature. My weapon of choice.

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.967
From the moment I killed the young lady
in the record shop,

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.850
- I knew you would...
- ...stop at nothing to catch me.

01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.562
I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.567
Whether she broke you
that night you met or let you go,

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.883
whether you let her run in Morocco,

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.081
whether she went to Atlee or not...

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.251
You were certain we'd end up
where we are right now.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.924
Then, again,

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:03.201
so was I.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.845
<i>I know you, Lane.</i>

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:08.810
<i>Somewhere along the line,
you had a crisis of faith.</i>

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:12.362
Human life didn't matter anymore.
Or maybe it never really did.

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.889
Either way,
you killed too many innocent people

01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:20.090
without ever asking
who was giving the orders or why.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.445
<i>You blame the system for what you are,
instead of yourself.</i>

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:28.961
You wanted revenge,
but Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:32.283
You needed help.
You needed money, a lot of it.

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.764
And you'll stop at nothing to get it.

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.686
That's how I know
I'm going to put you in a box.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.246
Where's the disk?

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.291
Where is the disk?

01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.000
You like to play games.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.925
I have a game for you.

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:52.843
I'll give you $50 million

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.769
<i>to let Benji go.</i>

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.611
Where is the disk?

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.006
Where is the disk?

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:19.605
You're looking at it.

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.921
I am the disk.

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:24.562
I memorized it.
All £2.4 billion in numbered accounts.

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.882
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.488
<i>Without this money, you're nothing.
Without me, you're nothing.</i>

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.003
<i>Right now, you're thinking it's a bluff.</i>

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:39.930
<i>I'd never let my friends die.</i>

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.288
<i>I couldn't possibly memorize
the entire disk.</i>

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.329
There's only one way to be sure.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.165
Let Benji go.

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:06.927
Take him.

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:13.851
They come one step closer, shoot me.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.805
Stop!

01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:22.850
You remember I told you one day
you were going to take things too far?

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.720
This is me speaking, by the way,
it's not him.

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.681
The only way this ends is you and me,
Lane, face to face.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.685
<i>Only this time,
I won't be locked in a glass box.</i>

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.211
<i>You want your money?</i>

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.640
The Bone Doctor
is going to have to

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.080
beat it out of me!

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:40.371
Now let Benji go.

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:47.083
1-3-9...

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.085
- Go.
- Ethan...

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.844
Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.527
What do I do?

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.001
Kill the woman.

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.803
I need Hunt alive.

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.289
- Go!
<i>- It's Benji. Where am I going?</i>

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.885
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.086
Then get ready.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.085
Which way?

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.923
Now let's see what you're made of.

02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:10.846
Face to face, just as you wished, Ethan.

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.810
It hurts, I know.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.651
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:43.331
Mr. Lane,

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.843
meet the IMF.

02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.611
You're free now.

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.205
Where will you go?

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:14.886
I don't know.

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.250
I've done my part.

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:21.046
Yeah.

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:27.931
Ethan, we got to go!

02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.609
You'd better hurry now.

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.080
Good luck.

02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.964
You know how to find me.

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.171
Director Hunley?

02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.044
Director Hunley!

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:24.360
Uh, Mr. Chairman.

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:26.249
Six months ago,
you stood before this panel

02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:29.130
and demanded that
the IMF be dissolved.

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.884
That is correct, sir.

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.849
How do you explain
your testimony today?

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.241
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.688
the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.331
In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:44.244
his cover had to be absolute.

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.481
The whole operation was known

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:48.530
only to myself
and a handful of IMF agents.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.721
So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate scheme

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:55.802
to expose the so-called Syndicate.

02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.201
That is correct, sir.

02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:02.320
Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:04.404
That is correct, sir.

02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.930
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:13.802
Uh, desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:19.526
And you, Mr. Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.243
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.368
without the Secretary's approval.

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.727
Welcome to the IMF,

02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:39.325
Mr. Secretary.
