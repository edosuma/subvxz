00:51.718 --> 00:53.219
Look out!

00:57.515 --> 00:59.184
Damn it.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.646
Turn off the engine! Get out of the car!

01:04.189 --> 01:05.273
Now what?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.025
One more when you have a chance.
Thank you.

03:12.942 --> 03:13.943
That's for you.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.237
-Sure you don't want to run a tab?
-No, no.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.073
Just one beer at a time. Thank you.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.078
Excuse me.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.832
Hey, Ringo.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.009
Curse of a youthful complexion, I guess.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.179
-What will it be?
-Sprite with lemon and ice.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.228
What are you looking at?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.607
-Sorry.
-What are you looking at, rough road?

03:55.652 --> 03:58.988
-"Rough road"?
-As in, "40 Miles of," "face like."

04:13.461 --> 04:16.339
-What?
-Hey, look, you're staring at me, kid.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.258
-You okay?
-Yeah.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.343
-Anything else?
-No.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.055
Whoa.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.556
Charmer.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.433
Right.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.352
Rough road.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.021
That was kinda funny, though.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.815
You liked that, huh?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.067
I'll be right with you.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.989
Hey, let me get a pint.
And one for you, too.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.492
-Thanks, man. I'll grab it later.
-Have it with me now.

05:27.327 --> 05:31.039
-I don't drink when I'm working, man.
-Come on. I know how this works.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.375
You don't have a drink with me
and just keep my seven bucks.

05:34.459 --> 05:38.087
I don't wanna give you this money.
I want you to have a drink with me.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.757
-Yeah, why's that?
-I think you're a good-looking woman.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.385
'Cause I'm wondering
how far those tattoos go.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.763
'Cause I'd like to lick 'em.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.098
And I think, maybe,
you might like that, too.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.560
You never know. But I gotta work. And, uh,
plenty of ladies in here with tattoos.

05:52.643 --> 05:57.273
Come on. At least give me your number
and your name. I'm Johnny.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.901
Johnny, you're gonna
have to let go of my arm now.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.111
Hey, hey, lady's trying to work.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.239
How's she gonna pour drinks
with you holding onto her arm? Let go.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.534
Thank you. You all right?

06:09.243 --> 06:11.496
Yeah. He's just a drunk.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.956
I must be if I thought
you were worth my time...

06:14.499 --> 06:15.500
skank.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.086
That's classy.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.214
I'm sorry, did you say something?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.384
Yeah.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.430
You just made my night.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.558
Shitbird.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.690
You like that? Get out of here.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.112
What are you doing? Don't do--

06:48.699 --> 06:52.537
you can walk out
or I will carry your ass out... like him.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.248
Hey, Ringo. He's good, man.
He was helping me out. Can you...

06:58.584 --> 07:00.628
You good here

07:00.711 --> 07:02.004
Get your ass up.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.263
Dealing with assholes like that
all the time.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.266
-You shouldn't have to.
-Yeah, well...

07:15.184 --> 07:16.811
I could trouble you for another beer?

07:17.645 --> 07:19.063
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.277
Didn't need saving.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.071
-Maybe I just don't like assholes.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.824
-That's for you. Thank you.
-No. It's on me.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.576
No,  that's okay.
You don't have to do that.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.618
It's on me.

07:33.995 --> 07:34.996
Thank you.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.708
Got a name?

07:39.792 --> 07:40.626
Uh...

07:40.710 --> 07:42.628
-Pete.
-Pete.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.714
Beth.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.259
Thank you for the beer, Beth.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.303
-Nice to meet you, Pete.
-Yeah.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.409
I give them up...

08:14.535 --> 08:15.745
they will kill me.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.375
Said the bleeding man tied to a chair.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.592
I know you came from New York.
Who sent you?

08:46.442 --> 08:47.610
Be smart.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.199
Konchevsky?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.493
Who is that?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.203
I'm...

08:58.371 --> 09:00.122
Doesn't matter. I work...

09:01.415 --> 09:03.292
worked for Fiona.

09:03.876 --> 09:08.714
Ah. Yes, yes.
I expected her yesterday. Where is she?

09:08.798 --> 09:09.799
She's dead.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.593
Someone killed them all.
I'm the only one left.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.222
Do you have what I paid for

09:17.306 --> 09:18.683
Someone knows.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.145
Whatever-- Whatever this is,
they killed them all for it.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.397
Except you.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.567
Bring the photographs to me,
I will keep you safe.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.651
No.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.866
Look, whatever this is, I want out of it.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.328
I get the money, you get the photos,
and we're done.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.871
Tell me where you are.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.374
Michigan.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.960
-Why are you in Michigan?
-I ran.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.879
Last place anyone would ever look for me.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.716
Last place I'd ever look for anything.

09:52.883 --> 09:56.804
It's very noisy there.
Very hard to hear you.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.097
Meet me here tomorrow night.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.017
Or else I'm in the wind,
and you'll never hear from me again.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.519
Lola's Roadhouse.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.896
Come alone. I'll find you.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.327
Do you believe in providence, Sergei?

10:21.662 --> 10:24.206
I don't even know what that is.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.087
I didn't know about this girl.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.090
I had missed her.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.677
But then she's brought back to me.
And that is providence.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.055
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.139
You're real luck.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.183
Oh, it is not luck.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.561
Look, I did good for you.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.023
You promised... you'd let me go.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.691
That is not true.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.611
I promised to give you peace.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.614
I don't even know what--

11:20.054 --> 11:21.389
So what brings you here?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.892
I'm just, uh, staying over at the motel.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.730
I heard the music,
and it just sounded good, so here I am.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.649
To Michigan?

11:31.732 --> 11:33.859
Uh... Just passing through.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.778
Where to?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.615
Next place I'll be passing through.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.076
-Hmm, I see. A travelin' man, huh?
-Yeah.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.286
-Just a regular Sal Paradise.
-Uh...

11:44.370 --> 11:46.622
Able to pick up and take off
whenever you like, huh?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.999
Yeah. Pretty much.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.335
You got the "man of mystery"
thing down. I give you that.

11:54.505 --> 11:59.760
So you come in here and defend my honor
and then just vanish into the night?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.471
Nah. You didn't need saving.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.644
-All right, Beth, it's been a pleasure.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.107
-You leaving tomorrow?
-Yeah. Bright and early.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.530
-You want to maybe grab another drink?
-No. I think I'm good.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.656
With me?

12:26.996 --> 12:28.956
-Forget I--
-Yeah, I'd like that.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.681
This is me.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.391
Okay.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.565
You gotta do me a favor, okay?
You promise me you're not an asshole.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.233
Uh...

12:56.817 --> 12:59.153
Isn't that the kind of thing
an asshole would do?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.323
Look, my bed's right there.

13:02.406 --> 13:06.702
You know, we can call this a night,
no hard feelings. I could just...

13:07.244 --> 13:08.245
Get in.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
-Okay.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.828
You play, huh?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.705
Yeah, you know...

14:33.581 --> 14:34.874
Played in high school.

14:35.749 --> 14:39.420
Bands, moved around, you know.
Never quite got the breaks.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.839
The usual shit.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.550
-Thank you. Uh...
-Mmm-hmm.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.093
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.805
Anyway, somehow I, uh...

14:51.807 --> 14:55.269
always ended up dating the drummer,
which everyone knows is, uh...

14:55.811 --> 14:57.313
the worst thing you can do.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.106
It's okay.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.774
-You gonna sit down?
-Sure.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.655
When you find yourself getting older

15:06.739 --> 15:10.075
and all you've got is a couple of guitars,
a bag of clothes, and...

15:12.411 --> 15:14.288
you realize something's gotta change.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.959
Sometimes things make
that decision for you. Right?

15:23.672 --> 15:24.757
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.095
You have a, uh... You got a little boy?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.265
-Yes, I do.
-Yeah.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.392
Rex. He's, um...

15:36.727 --> 15:37.728
He's eight.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.066
My mom has him when I work at the bar.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.112
Does that bother you?

15:47.738 --> 15:48.697
Why would it?

15:50.324 --> 15:53.035
Just a little too much real life
for a traveling man, maybe.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.537
Nah.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.418
Anyway, he's the, uh,
best thing that's ever happened to me.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.380
And it's just the two of us.
Always has been.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.799
His dad's not in the picture,
if you're wondering .

16:08.300 --> 16:11.095
Which is, um... the best option.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.058
And what about you

16:17.559 --> 16:19.603
No one waiting at home
with the porch light on?

16:20.562 --> 16:22.272
I wouldn't be here if there was.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.236
Well, that could be a line,
but I believe you.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.616
Something about you...

16:34.284 --> 16:36.495
I don't make a habit of this.
I just wanted--

16:36.578 --> 16:38.706
I don't make a habit of this either, so...

16:40.666 --> 16:42.835
Boy.

16:42.918 --> 16:43.961
Yeah.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.587
-We're really good at this, huh?
-Mmm.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.672
Yeah.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.386
I mean, you should be...

17:37.222 --> 17:39.266
-Should I see the other guy?
-Nah.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.061
Rough road.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.896
-Yeah, you're not kidding.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.191
What happened?

17:48.525 --> 17:49.693
Marine corps.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.709
You know,
I couldn't help noticing that ring.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.798
Yeah, I had a wife.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.176
Kids.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.012
Had?

18:18.764 --> 18:19.890
They're dead.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.852
God. I'm sorry.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.232
Was it an accident?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.484
No, they were taken from me.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.944
Can't even imagine.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.866
How long ago?

18:39.284 --> 18:40.744
You mind my asking?

18:41.787 --> 18:42.788
You know...

18:43.497 --> 18:45.624
there are times
where it feels like yesterday.

18:45.707 --> 18:46.750
You know?

18:50.045 --> 18:52.631
Sometimes it feels
like a million years ago.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.362
All that moving around,
it must get lonely, huh?

19:17.948 --> 19:19.408
I had this friend,

19:20.242 --> 19:22.953
said that we're all lonely.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.457
And all life is, is just trying not to be.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.253
I'd say that's...

19:32.379 --> 19:33.380
spot on.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.635
It was a woman who told you that,
wasn't it?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.721
-Yeah, it was.
-Yeah.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.771
I'm not lonely right now.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.981
Yeah.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.569
Yeah, I ain't lonely either.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.721
I'm glad you came
to the bar tonight, Pete.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.271
Hey, that's when you get to say,
"Yeah, me too."

20:31.355 --> 20:32.356
Frank.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.987
My name, it's...

20:40.989 --> 20:43.075
it's not Pete, it's Frank.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.246
Uh...

20:48.830 --> 20:51.833
Okay, so I'm confused.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.837
Look, I did some shit that could...
embarrass some people.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.840
They're powerful people,
so I get to be Pete.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.343
They get to not be embarrassed.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.014
You some kind of criminal
in law trouble or...

21:06.598 --> 21:07.599
No.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.104
"No"

21:13.605 --> 21:14.606
Yeah.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.150
Why'd you tell me?

21:18.902 --> 21:20.320
I want this to be honest.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.990
Yeah, well...

21:26.493 --> 21:31.540
So some of the shit you did,
does it explain all those scars?

21:31.623 --> 21:32.833
Some of 'em.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.046
I guess you didn't have
to tell me any of that.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.090
I didn't, but...

21:41.216 --> 21:45.137
Look, my past, just...
it's my past. You know?

21:46.054 --> 21:48.473
The only thing that matters here
is that my shit, my issues,

21:48.557 --> 21:50.892
they won't come to your front door,
you know. And that's...

21:51.810 --> 21:53.186
That's-- That's a promise.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.276
God damn.
I should throw you out right now.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.742
But somehow I don't feel like I need to.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.582
Stupid, maybe.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.628
I've only known you, what

22:26.845 --> 22:28.013
All right.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.390
Frank.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.103
-Suits you better, you know?
-Yeah.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.691
I mean, shit, it could be Eugene.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.195
-You imagine?
-No.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.781
I've always hated that name. Eugene.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.578
Hello, Frank.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.585
Guess you gotta take the good
when it comes, huh?

23:01.797 --> 23:02.881
Yeah.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.884
Yeah, I guess you do.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.445
You're gonna learn about pain.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.989
You're gonna learn about loss.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.005
It's okay. Your mom's upstairs.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.924
I'm just, uh... I'm a friend.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.093
-My name's Pete. You must be Rex, right?

24:30.177 --> 24:31.386
Rex?

24:32.179 --> 24:35.140
Hi, baby. I didn't know you were home.
How come you didn't come get me?

24:35.223 --> 24:38.935
Grandma gave me the key.
She told me not to wake you.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.396
-Right.
-Who is he

24:41.480 --> 24:44.691
He is a friend of mine,
and he needed a place to stay.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.985
So I said he could
stay with us last night. Okay?

24:47.068 --> 24:48.904
I get it, Rex. It's your house.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.824
I'm just some strange man. For all
you know, I could be a Rangers fan, huh?

24:52.908 --> 24:53.825
Are you?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.286
-I am.
-Your team sucks.

24:56.369 --> 24:58.330
Yes, they do, Rex.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.874
00. What happened?

25:00.957 --> 25:02.417
Ms. Thomas fell over again.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.669
Grandma said
she needed to go help her out.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.546
She didn't give me breakfast, either.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.257
Said she assumed
you at least had some food in the house.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.553
Look, um... this is not how I saw
this morning going. I'm sorry.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.597
No, I'm sorry
about sneaking off like that.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.308
Mom, there's no Fruit Loops or OJ.

25:18.391 --> 25:21.728
Yeah, I know, baby. I was gonna go
to the market. I just haven't, um...

25:23.563 --> 25:24.648
had a second.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.566
Do you... Maybe you should...

25:26.650 --> 25:29.736
-Okay. I'll take off.
-Mom, I'm hungry.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.947
Hey, Rex, is there any place
around here that's special?

25:32.030 --> 25:33.281
Someplace you like, you know?

25:33.365 --> 25:34.658
-Maybe--
-No, you don't have to--

25:34.741 --> 25:37.118
Maybe the three of us. Maybe we go.
It's my treat, no problem.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.412
I appreciate what you're doing,
you don't have to do that.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.123
-What am I doing? It's breakfast.
-Donatello's! I want pancakes.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.835
I like pancakes. I do.
I really like pancakes.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.463
-What do you say?
-Come on, Mom.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.006
-Come on, Mom.
-Last chance to escape.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.801
I don't want a chance to escape.
I want pancakes.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.054
-Put your jacket on.
-Yes!

25:57.847 --> 25:59.724
Pass me a little bit
of that syrup. Yeah?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.810
Can you spare some?
Ah, man. Thank you, bud.

26:04.229 --> 26:08.233
-So how many nights a week you work there?
-Just the weekends. I teach.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.151
Teach

26:10.235 --> 26:11.861
-Guitar, piano.
-Yeah?

26:12.946 --> 26:15.282
Yeah. But the bar
keeps the lights on, so...

26:15.365 --> 26:16.366
I get it.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.036
Yeah. Keeps this kid
in hockey shirts, right?

26:20.120 --> 26:21.454
-I get to hear the music.
-Wow.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.165
Okay, you know what

26:24.249 --> 26:27.460
-Get you some pancakes for that syrup.
-So good.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.671
-Oh, yeah?
-You should stay over more often.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.298
I appreciate that, buddy.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.049
-Mmm-hmm.

26:34.384 --> 26:38.263
Grandma never brings me here.
And Mom, only special occasions.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.681
Well, you know...

26:42.183 --> 26:46.146
Wait, you two aren't, like,
getting married or something?

26:46.229 --> 26:47.522
-No. We are, uh...
-I think...

26:47.606 --> 26:49.733
I think we're just friends.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.611
That's right.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.448
Did you two have sex last night?

26:57.198 --> 26:59.242
Okay. -Oh, boy.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.329
Mom, I'm nearly nine. We know this stuff.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.371
Is that so?

27:03.455 --> 27:07.083
You have heard of the Internet?
Paulie's brother showed us some--

27:07.167 --> 27:09.502
Know what? I think you and I
are gonna talk about this later.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.005
It was kinda gross,
so I went outside to play hockey.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.049
He does listen to me occasionally.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.384
-Hockey player, Rex?
-Yes, I am.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.304
Yeah, he'd, uh, play all day if he could.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.389
Yeah, my son was the same.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.558
You have a son?

27:27.896 --> 27:29.022
Yeah.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.608
Where is he He doesn't--

27:31.691 --> 27:35.737
I just... I don't get to see him
the way I want to, Rex.

27:37.656 --> 27:42.077
Yeah, I don't see my dad, either.
Haven't seen him since I was a little kid.

27:43.870 --> 27:48.541
Well, you know...
wherever he is, I'm sure he misses you.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.920
He doesn't really know me.
Do you miss yours?

27:52.003 --> 27:53.380
I miss him every day.

28:15.318 --> 28:19.489
Guess I'll try to say goodbye to you
like an adult this time, huh?

28:19.572 --> 28:21.449
-I appreciate that.
-Yeah.

28:22.617 --> 28:23.827
He's a good kid.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.123
-Yeah. Knows a little too much, I think.

28:28.832 --> 28:32.210
He'd rather play hockey.
I think you're safe.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.503
For now, yeah.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.924
Look, if I'm ever back this way,
maybe we could--

28:38.007 --> 28:40.343
-You've got my number.
-Yeah, I do.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.265
-Okay.
-Yeah.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.520
Take care.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.692
You know,
the band's playing again tonight.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.905
Just sayin'.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.036
Listen, you, uh... you take care, okay?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.497
Okay.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.662
Hey!

29:49.746 --> 29:51.831
Hey, miss, that room wasn't occupied.

29:51.915 --> 29:52.957
Miss!

29:55.043 --> 29:56.044
Miss!

29:58.588 --> 29:59.589
Sorry.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.424
You all right?

30:01.508 --> 30:03.009
Are you following me?

30:03.092 --> 30:05.178
Why would I be following you?

30:05.261 --> 30:07.639
Hey

32:14.807 --> 32:15.808
Ugh.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.686
What the hell?

32:19.187 --> 32:20.772
[horn honking

32:20.855 --> 32:22.148
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.968
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.321
Well, I wasn't expecting to see you again.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.406
You know...

33:13.282 --> 33:14.742
It's a real good band.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.246
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.330
Huh.

33:20.039 --> 33:22.583
-So how far did you get?
-About two hours down the road.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.669
Two hours.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.630
Well, I guess that I should be
real insulted or real flattered, huh?

33:27.714 --> 33:30.133
It just took some time, you know,

33:30.216 --> 33:32.927
for it to really sink in
just how good that music was.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.971
Felt like it'd be a shame to miss out.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.222
Well, all right.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.434
-One beer at a time?
-Yeah.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.359
Thank you.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.444
Yeah.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.450
Hey.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.745
-You all right?
-Yeah.

34:40.828 --> 34:44.415
-Yeah. Are you sure?
-Yeah. It's nothing.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.795
Yo, Beth, can I get a beer?

34:48.878 --> 34:50.713
-No causing any trouble.
-All right.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.611
-Sorry.
-Hey, what's the hurry?

35:13.694 --> 35:16.989
-Come dance with me.
-Sorry. Stop, stop. Get off me!

35:58.072 --> 35:59.073
No, no, no.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.709
Hi, ladies, I'm sorry,
someone just got real sick in there.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.002
I'd use the men's room.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.048
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you?

36:16.132 --> 36:18.092
My friend...

36:18.176 --> 36:21.345
I think she might be a little bit sick.
So I'm just gonna go check on her.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.930
I think she went home, buddy.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.974
-She went home?
-Yeah. I think you should, too.

36:25.057 --> 36:28.227
Yeah, I was... She...
Nah, I'm-I'm-- I'm pretty sure.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.937
I think you have the wrong person here.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.063
You wish we did.

36:31.898 --> 36:32.899
Get back.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.615
Eddie

36:43.576 --> 36:44.452
No shots.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.747
Nobody mentioned a guy with her.

36:57.798 --> 36:58.966
Dumbass.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.095
You're so far over your head,
you can't even see the light.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.223
Is that right?

38:41.694 --> 38:42.695
Who are you?

38:44.405 --> 38:45.906
Why are they coming after you?

38:45.990 --> 38:47.908
No. I'm outta here.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.410
You stay where you are.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.580
-Who are they?
-I don't know. I don't know.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.749
I came in here,
and they asked me if I wanted to party,

38:54.832 --> 38:57.668
and then I said no,
and they just, like, freaked out on me.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.670
I don't know.
Chicks can be rough.

38:59.754 --> 39:00.671
Bullshit.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.136
There's more of 'em out there.

39:09.805 --> 39:13.559
And what

39:14.560 --> 39:17.104
I'm just an asshole who couldn't
stay out of trouble, that's all.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.693
I'm gonna ask you one more time, kid.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.363
You tell me who they are.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.159
No? Okay.

39:33.412 --> 39:34.747
No, wait, wait, wait!

39:36.874 --> 39:40.795
If there's more people out there,
people like this...

39:42.004 --> 39:45.383
I mean, you didn't just come in here
to leave me for them. Did you?

39:48.469 --> 39:49.720
You can help me.

39:50.596 --> 39:51.639
Can't you?

39:52.848 --> 39:53.974
You're like them.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.477
Better, even.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.524
Please.

40:04.026 --> 40:07.071
Thank you all very much! See ya next time.

40:17.665 --> 40:18.666
Let's go.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.586
-Just... do exactly what I say.
-Okay.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.338
Easy.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.090
It's okay.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.933
It's okay. It's okay. Go this way.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.685
Stay with me.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.520
Easy.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.899
Excuse me.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.111
-Go, go, go.
-Wait, wait, wait. What What?

40:58.164 --> 41:00.499
-Go! Go now!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.801
Hey! What's your problem, man?

41:10.885 --> 41:13.053
Come on.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.645
Hey, Ringo, you wanna deal
with these assholes?

41:49.965 --> 41:50.925
Get your ass up.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.478
No! No! No! Help me!

42:21.330 --> 42:22.498
Get off of her!

42:31.382 --> 42:32.424
Hey!

42:33.842 --> 42:34.969
Come on.

43:01.328 --> 43:02.288
No, no, no!

43:05.541 --> 43:06.959
Frank!

44:19.615 --> 44:22.201
No. No. No.

44:22.284 --> 44:24.161
Hey, hey, hey...

44:24.244 --> 44:25.829
-I got you.

44:26.497 --> 44:30.209
Get me a rag! Get me a goddamn rag!

44:30.292 --> 44:33.712
-I got you. Okay. Okay. I'm right here.

44:33.796 --> 44:36.590
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.559
We're being followed.

44:53.065 --> 44:54.566
Look out!

44:59.405 --> 45:00.280
Now what?

45:26.306 --> 45:29.059
No, please. Please just let me go. Please.

45:34.356 --> 45:36.734
Honestly, I don't know
why these people are after me.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.944
Shut up.
Find the closest hospital. Find it now.

45:39.027 --> 45:40.529
-Okay, yeah--
-Let's go!

45:40.612 --> 45:42.364
Okay. Up three blocks,
then left at the light.

45:42.448 --> 45:45.534
Hey, Beth

45:45.617 --> 45:47.327
Yeah.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.247
I know it hurts,
but you're gonna be all right.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.000
-You need to know that.
-Rex. He's alone.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.126
Where's the turn?

45:54.209 --> 45:56.545
-I don't see any goddamn turn!
-It's here! Left here!

46:09.892 --> 46:11.393
Shit. You all right, man?

46:11.477 --> 46:12.936
-Get your hands off me.
-Take it easy.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.772
-You're bleeding--
-I got a woman in the back.

46:14.855 --> 46:16.982
You help her! Hurry, let's go!

46:17.065 --> 46:18.650
-Come on!
-All right.

46:18.734 --> 46:20.527
This is a gunshot wound.
What happened here?

46:20.611 --> 46:22.112
We have to call the cops.
Take it easy.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.739
-No, I'm okay.
-I got you. Don't worry.

46:23.822 --> 46:24.990
I've gotta get home to my kid.

46:25.073 --> 46:26.575
-Gonna take care of you.
-Let me go!

46:26.658 --> 46:28.202
-God damn.
-Grab her legs.

46:28.285 --> 46:29.286
No!

46:29.369 --> 46:31.163
I'm sorry. I am so goddamn sorry.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.247
I gotta get home to Rex.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.625
-I'll call him. He's gonna be okay.
-Please.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.418
-Hey, you can't leave the scene, man.
-Go!

46:36.502 --> 46:38.587
-Stay here! Let's go.
-Take care of her, hear?

46:38.670 --> 46:39.797
You take care of her!

46:39.880 --> 46:41.423
-Go!
-Let's go!

46:47.513 --> 46:48.514
Now what?

47:17.125 --> 47:19.336
This is not what I signed up for.

47:20.671 --> 47:24.341
Find the girl. And whoever she's with.

47:27.511 --> 47:30.389
And you'll tell me where they are,
and you'll keep your people away.

47:30.472 --> 47:33.433
This has gotten too big.
Look at this mess.

47:35.727 --> 47:37.020
Call it a turf war.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.189
It happens.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.442
Thank you, Lieutenant.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.365
You can go now.

47:58.041 --> 47:59.585
It was outside the window.

47:59.668 --> 48:02.296
The girl must have dropped it
when she was trying to get out.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.887
Laptop is in there. It's what you wanted?

48:29.156 --> 48:30.157
Show me.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.749
You didn't say she'd have help.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.045
He was good.

48:44.212 --> 48:45.464
As good as I've seen.

48:48.425 --> 48:51.094
This is someone's dog, let off the leash.

48:53.055 --> 48:55.724
A man this good
won't be that hard to find.

48:56.558 --> 48:58.268
There'll be people who know him...

49:00.103 --> 49:01.688
who care for him...

49:04.066 --> 49:05.442
or who fear him.

49:11.114 --> 49:12.991
And they'll tell me how to find him.

49:34.012 --> 49:36.932
Sweet dreams, asshole.

49:59.079 --> 50:00.247
Thank you.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.456
Will there be more of them?

50:49.004 --> 50:50.130
I hope so.
