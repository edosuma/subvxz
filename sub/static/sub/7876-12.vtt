00:30.718 --> 00:34.271
Three, two, one, and...

00:37.104 --> 00:38.041
Grand.

00:38.321 --> 00:40.688
{pos(192,210}That it is, boy.
Nothing more satisfying

00:40.813 --> 00:43.637
{pos(192,180}than witnessing the uniformity
of a neighborhood in sync.

00:43.875 --> 00:47.875
{pos(192,210}The only thing that even comes close
is Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video.

00:53.696 --> 00:55.237
Dad, will you sign my petition?

00:55.362 --> 00:58.413
I'm trying to get the city to give us
{those }blue recycling bins for{ our} neighborhood.

00:58.538 --> 01:00.726
{pos(192,185}Absolutely not!
I'm zombie dancing with my son.

01:00.910 --> 01:03.905
{pos(192,210}I get it. You're against recycling
because I'm for it, right?

01:04.030 --> 01:04.959
{pos(192,210}Right.

01:05.084 --> 01:07.837
{pos(192,210}But in a way, wrong.
Because everything you say is wrong.

01:07.962 --> 01:10.865
{pos(192,210}Hear that, Steve?
That's the sound of The Man talking.

01:15.199 --> 01:17.757
- What the hell?!
- Neighborhood Watch, missy.

01:17.882 --> 01:19.787
Mailbox stickers
are against the bylaws.

01:19.985 --> 01:21.427
{pos(192,220}Great takedown, Greg.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.463
{pos(192,220}Hear that?

01:27.742 --> 01:30.799
{pos(192,220}An aboveground sprinkler
on the front lawn.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.610
{pos(220,190}No sir. What's next?

01:32.735 --> 01:35.855
{pos(192,190}Prostitutes rising out of the ground
and spitting all over our lawns?

01:35.980 --> 01:39.104
{pos(192,220}Not in my neighborhood! When's the next
Homeowners' Association meeting?

01:39.229 --> 01:41.533
{pos(192,220}- A week from Monday.
- Then I will see you in ten days.

01:41.658 --> 01:44.562
{pos(192,220}Stay at this emotional level
until then. I know I will.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.481
{{pos(192,230 FIVE DAYS LATER}

01:48.357 --> 01:51.068
{pos(192,220}This new toothpaste tastes
exactly like I thought it would!

01:53.804 --> 01:55.573
It may not seem
like much of a threat,

01:55.835 --> 01:58.893
{pos(192,220}but an aboveground sprinkler
is a snake in the grass.

02:01.001 --> 02:02.329
And what about the children?

02:03.777 --> 02:06.567
<i>Sure, it looks like an innocent game
of dolly catch.</i>

02:06.692 --> 02:08.306
<i>But wait! Bad throw.</i>

02:13.576 --> 02:15.859
{pos(192,220}I was having no idea of danger.

02:15.984 --> 02:17.911
{pos(192,220}I move to prohibit
aboveground sprinklers.

02:18.036 --> 02:20.262
{pos(192,220}- I second that.
- All in favor say "aye."

02:21.739 --> 02:22.779
{pos(192,220}See, son?

02:22.904 --> 02:25.311
{pos(192,220}- The system works.
- You were awesome, Dad.

02:25.749 --> 02:27.638
Stop killing Mother Earth.

02:27.826 --> 02:29.271
Recycle or die.

02:29.519 --> 02:32.389
We can't entertain
motions not on the agenda.

02:32.514 --> 02:35.234
You can leave your jacket off,
but please sit down.

02:35.782 --> 02:38.518
Say, Stan, have you considered
coming back to the board?

02:38.643 --> 02:40.159
We still don't have a chairman.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.122
No can do... term limits, you know.

02:42.247 --> 02:43.829
And I served my eight terms.

02:44.139 --> 02:45.620
- Maybe I could be chair...
- No!

02:45.745 --> 02:48.114
{Wait, }Sweetie. I'm sorry, I cut you off.
Please finish your thought.

02:48.239 --> 02:49.906
Maybe I could be chairman.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.476
Why doesn't Stan
think I have what it takes

02:56.601 --> 02:58.886
to be chairman
of the Homeowners' Association?

02:59.299 --> 03:01.746
All it takes is two hours
on Monday night.

03:02.006 --> 03:03.777
I don't do anything Monday nights.

03:03.902 --> 03:07.144
- You clean my bowl on Monday nights.
- Humans are talking!

03:07.312 --> 03:10.480
Dad just doesn't get it. He doesn't even
want to learn about recycling.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.323
He's a fudge-maker.
No ifs, ands, or buts about it.

03:13.448 --> 03:15.260
- Where's the cola?
- In the pantry.

03:15.385 --> 03:16.862
Oh, no! What?!

03:19.166 --> 03:21.659
- It's room temp.
- So put it in the fridge.

03:23.433 --> 03:26.856
Look, Stan will be home
from the store any second,

03:26.981 --> 03:29.137
and I put grenadine on the list.

03:29.262 --> 03:32.784
Grenadine turns cold cola
into a Roy Rogers.

03:33.105 --> 03:35.714
You know what grenadine
turns warm cola into?

03:35.839 --> 03:38.213
You tell me
when I throw it in your face.

03:39.841 --> 03:42.184
Sorry I took so long.
I farted pulling into the driveway

03:42.309 --> 03:44.098
and I just wanted
to enjoy it for a while.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.014
Stan, is there another bag
in the car?

03:49.496 --> 03:51.137
But there's no grenadine in here.

03:51.262 --> 03:53.259
- You don't need grenadine.
- Yes, I do.

03:53.384 --> 03:55.442
It goes in cola
to make a Roy Rogers.

03:55.672 --> 03:57.626
I had a Roy Rogers once.
Hated it.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.878
Won't have it in my house.
That and Cilantro.

04:00.003 --> 04:01.692
Not the herb, the Mexican singer.

04:01.817 --> 04:03.742
{He's going to be huge, and }I want nothing to do with him.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.675
- But that's not fair.
- No grenadine!

04:05.800 --> 04:07.865
- I'm dying.
- No whining!

04:16.659 --> 04:17.858
What the hell?

04:19.591 --> 04:22.010
- What are you doing? This is my car.
- Sorry, bruddah.

04:22.135 --> 04:24.273
It was parked in the front
of the fire hydrant.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.833
- But we don't have a fire hydrant.
- You do now.

04:27.954 --> 04:30.268
Morning, Stan.
Here to inaugurate the new hydrant?

04:30.555 --> 04:33.882
- Better christen it with my fire hose
- Principal Lewis!

04:34.007 --> 04:35.664
Are you excited or terrified?

04:35.789 --> 04:37.610
I have to decide
whether I'm joking or not.

04:37.838 --> 04:39.249
What's this hydrant doing here?

04:39.374 --> 04:42.448
It was pushed {through }by the new chairman
of the Homeowners' Association.

04:42.743 --> 04:45.409
- Roy Rogers McFreely.
- Who?

04:47.945 --> 04:50.037
Roy Rogers McFreely's the name.

04:50.168 --> 04:52.954
Chairing the Homeowners'
Association's my game.

04:53.201 --> 04:55.661
Yes, I know what you're thinking,
but the jacket is vintage.

04:55.786 --> 04:58.672
- You won't {be able to }find one anywhere.
- You can't put a hydrant here!

04:58.844 --> 05:01.044
Oh, no? Is this inside your house?

05:01.401 --> 05:04.335
Maybe you're in charge there,
where they don't serve grenadine!

05:04.460 --> 05:06.260
But out here, I'm the law.

05:06.456 --> 05:08.106
You're in McFreelytown.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.576
Royville.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.184
Rogersberg.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.938
Excuse me.
Anyway, this is my town.

05:14.378 --> 05:15.689
Charles, we're moving out!

05:20.503 --> 05:23.197
I apologize
for the lack of drama in this exit.

05:38.745 --> 05:40.901
See something you like?
Nice, isn't it?

05:41.026 --> 05:43.276
A gift from the fire chief himself.

05:43.648 --> 05:44.897
Because of the hydrant.

05:45.022 --> 05:47.390
You know how hard it is
to get a real fireman's helmet?

05:47.515 --> 05:50.099
I should know. I tried to order one
online so I could go in

05:50.267 --> 05:51.632
and loot burning houses.

05:51.757 --> 05:52.757
Now, I can.

05:53.027 --> 05:56.381
Can't wait to head downtown
if the Wizards win the championship.

05:56.577 --> 05:58.748
You feel that pressure
on the back of your neck, Dad?

05:58.873 --> 06:01.056
That's the thumb of The Man
pressing down on you.

06:01.181 --> 06:02.429
I'm still The Man.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.546
I'm going to have that hydrant removed
next Monday at the {Homeowners' Association }meeting.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.166
Yes, The Man gets the biggest piece.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.476
And you?
You'll have this little piece.

06:12.601 --> 06:15.906
While you're serving me, how about
a little dollop of horseradish{ on the side}.

06:16.031 --> 06:17.681
This is my horseradish!

06:17.806 --> 06:18.903
All of it.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.365
Well, you win this round.

06:42.490 --> 06:45.359
I'm going to go to my room
and listen to Cilantro albums.

06:45.484 --> 06:47.734
<i>El perro, el perro es mi corazon...</i>

06:48.543 --> 06:50.693
Dad, what happened to the system?

06:50.929 --> 06:52.039
Is it broken?

06:52.164 --> 06:55.158
No, son, the system's stronger
than an alien in a wig.

06:55.283 --> 06:58.527
At next Monday's board meeting,
that hydrant's going bye-bye.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.002
Excuse me a second.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.790
Oh, God, it hurts more coming up!

07:17.932 --> 07:19.889
You woke me up
in the middle of a dream!

07:20.014 --> 07:22.247
I was in the "Sledgehammer" video,
and I was made of clay,

07:22.372 --> 07:24.359
and I was so flexible
and I loved it!

07:24.609 --> 07:26.358
Oh, that's a good video, yah?

07:26.483 --> 07:29.435
But the Homeowners' Association ordered
earlier trash pickup

07:29.560 --> 07:30.750
at this house only.

07:30.893 --> 07:33.285
- Tell him seven days a week.
- Seven days a week!

07:34.178 --> 07:35.537
- Tell him no.
- No!

07:35.818 --> 07:36.871
I can hear you.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.290
Drive! Let's go!

07:40.834 --> 07:43.378
I can see you.
I can see your whole upper body.

07:43.681 --> 07:46.298
Good morning! Get me out of here.
He's putting it together.

07:49.322 --> 07:52.317
What's the matter, Dad?
The Man got his boot up your ass?

07:52.442 --> 07:54.000
Don't worry, I'm fine.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.285
The system's going to pull
that boot right out of my ass

07:56.410 --> 07:58.392
and sew my anus up nice and tight.

07:58.617 --> 08:00.006
Might even get it bleached.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.438
Birthday's coming up.

08:04.802 --> 08:06.533
Gotta think!
Gotta clear my head!

08:06.808 --> 08:08.394
Stan, I told you.

08:08.539 --> 08:09.780
I have a fever.

08:10.099 --> 08:12.620
That's why I went to bed
right after dinner.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.901
What to do, what to do,
what to do...

08:17.026 --> 08:17.973
Please.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.849
I really am not well.

08:21.105 --> 08:23.961
I'll just put that trash thing
in the proposal at Monday's meeting.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.260
What the...?

08:31.253 --> 08:32.852
A motion-sensor light?

08:33.087 --> 08:35.431
The Association doesn't allow
motion-sensor lights.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.144
It does now.

08:40.364 --> 08:42.423
- Listen, Roger.
- It's "Rogers".

08:42.548 --> 08:44.358
Roy Rogers McFreely.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.356
And I hate to waste
a good spotlight.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.543
"You see a lot Dr. Lecter.

08:49.850 --> 08:53.217
"But are you strong enough to point that
high-powered perception at yourself?

08:53.342 --> 08:54.492
"How about it?

08:54.842 --> 08:57.099
"Look at yourself
and write down the truth.

08:57.224 --> 08:58.645
"Or maybe you're afraid to."

09:02.514 --> 09:04.014
Well, that was good.

09:07.008 --> 09:09.463
And so I move that all bylaws,

09:09.588 --> 09:12.486
which have been recklessly
amended by Chairman McFreely,

09:12.821 --> 09:15.138
be reinstated
to their original glory.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.880
I also propose that a warning label
be placed on all horseradish

09:19.005 --> 09:21.835
that clearly states that if you ingest
an entire bottle,

09:21.960 --> 09:23.765
you will blow out your sphincter.

09:24.052 --> 09:26.110
Also, if anyone knows anyone
who recently died

09:26.235 --> 09:28.057
with an intact size three sphincter,

09:28.182 --> 09:31.695
please contact me, as I'm currently very
low on the waiting list for a donor.

09:34.518 --> 09:36.491
Let's put 'er to a vote.
Anyone in favor?

09:38.595 --> 09:41.191
And I vote no.
Motion denied unanimously.

09:41.316 --> 09:44.523
"In your face with a can of mace
Make you cry all over the place."

09:44.648 --> 09:47.218
Moving along... Father Donovan,
you want to paint your house

09:47.343 --> 09:49.232
a previously unapproved color.

09:49.357 --> 09:51.126
Linda, you want
a hedge-height exemption.

09:51.251 --> 09:53.383
And Sergei, you like bus maps
to be in Russian.

09:53.729 --> 09:56.055
I would prefer all maps
be in Russian.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.730
Except treasure maps.

09:57.927 --> 10:00.899
Sergei don't need to go
on another treasure hunt.

10:01.547 --> 10:02.547
No, sir.

10:03.045 --> 10:05.205
Turning to these motions
which we secretly agreed

10:05.330 --> 10:07.003
to approve last night
at Linda's house

10:07.128 --> 10:08.026
again, sorry

10:08.151 --> 10:11.222
I ate all the ambrosia salad,
I did not realize it was for everyone...

10:11.347 --> 10:12.354
all in favor?

10:13.028 --> 10:14.628
What? What's going on?

10:14.753 --> 10:15.794
Dirty politics.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.940
That's how your beloved system
really works.

10:18.065 --> 10:20.705
- What are you talking about?
- I think this symbol says it best.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.843
- Ghostbusters II?
- What?!

10:23.598 --> 10:26.955
I got to stop smoking salvia
before I go to the body painting place.

10:27.202 --> 10:28.752
"I ain't 'fraid of no ghost."

10:40.336 --> 10:44.101
Oh, God, non-native ornamental grasses.
Steve, don't look!

10:49.937 --> 10:52.714
Did you crash when you saw
the non-native ornamental grass?

10:52.839 --> 10:55.779
- I did the same thing!
- He did, the exact same thing.

10:58.145 --> 11:01.495
McFreely's corrupted the association
with backroom deals.

11:01.620 --> 11:04.552
Well, there's no way we're going
to enforce his obscene regulations.

11:04.677 --> 11:06.299
You're right about that.

11:07.942 --> 11:10.981
Because as of now,
the neighborhood watch is...

11:11.254 --> 11:12.295
disbanded.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.306
And the pink berets?
What of them?

11:22.599 --> 11:26.249
I'll wear them on my feet
when I pretend to be a lady surgeon.

11:27.304 --> 11:29.781
Tell me if I'm squeezing your ribs
too hard with my thighs.

11:29.906 --> 11:30.906
You're not.

11:31.187 --> 11:32.345
How about now?

11:39.204 --> 11:41.077
- Who died?
- The system.

11:41.824 --> 11:42.974
Happy, Haley?

11:43.174 --> 11:44.703
The system is dead.

11:45.006 --> 11:46.692
Dad, the system's not dead.

11:46.817 --> 11:49.875
{It's just that, }For the first time in your life,
you're on the outside looking in.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.995
The death you're feeling
is the loss of your innocence.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.739
Thanks, Haley.
Another simple point said long.

11:55.864 --> 11:59.564
Look, Dad, Roger's in charge
and your wishes are counter to his.

11:59.733 --> 12:01.792
That means you're part
of the counter-culture.

12:01.917 --> 12:03.573
And do know what that means, Dad?

12:03.698 --> 12:05.850
You and I are finally
on the same side.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.125
You're right!

12:07.534 --> 12:10.244
- So, what do we do?
- We stick it to The Man!

12:10.591 --> 12:12.088
Stick it to The Man?

12:12.213 --> 12:14.900
- Say it like you mean it!
- We're gonna stick it to The Man.

12:15.146 --> 12:17.204
- Louder!
- We're gonna stick it to The Man!

12:17.329 --> 12:19.765
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna stick it to The Man!

12:19.890 --> 12:22.475
- Ten percent more!
- We're gonna!

12:22.600 --> 12:25.118
- 90% less.
- We'll stick it to The Man.

12:29.641 --> 12:32.923
- Power to the people!
- Dad, that's still a little Hitler-y.

12:34.803 --> 12:37.653
Dad, I found out how you can
reintroduce your proposal

12:37.778 --> 12:40.105
at the next association meeting.
Look!

12:40.230 --> 12:41.918
- What is all this?
- Forms!

12:42.043 --> 12:44.466
If we fill them out properly
and submit them in a timely fashion,

12:44.591 --> 12:47.288
you can reintroduce your proposal
within 7 business days.

12:48.046 --> 12:49.910
Does my headband look like
the kind of thing

12:50.035 --> 12:51.853
a person who fills out forms
would wear?

12:52.212 --> 12:54.085
Is... Is that Mom's scarf?

12:54.210 --> 12:56.205
You're asking
all the wrong questions, Steve!

12:56.330 --> 12:59.013
Now that Roger's The Man,
it's time for revolution.

12:59.138 --> 13:01.510
But Roger's too powerful
for just the two of us to take down.

13:01.635 --> 13:03.693
- We're going to need help.
- When do I start?!

13:03.818 --> 13:05.440
I'll wear one of Mom's scarves, too.

13:05.565 --> 13:08.098
There's a butterfly one
that's just gorgeous.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.873
I know the one he's thinking of.
It is gorgeous.

13:15.050 --> 13:18.840
Thank you all for coming.
We find ourselves in troubling times.

13:19.170 --> 13:22.262
Not compared to the rest of the world,
obviously, but here in the...

13:23.163 --> 13:25.737
bosom of our upper-middle class...

13:27.483 --> 13:28.343
bosom...

13:32.959 --> 13:35.018
- The bosom?
- I'll take it from here, Dad.

13:35.143 --> 13:38.233
I kept saying bosom. I don't know why.
I've never used that word in my life.

13:38.358 --> 13:39.985
It's okay, Dad, it's okay.

13:40.261 --> 13:42.737
Chairman McFreely may have disbanded
the Neighborhood Watch.

13:42.944 --> 13:44.756
He may have taken your pink berets.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.909
But he can't take your spirit.
Now is the time to fight.

13:48.078 --> 13:51.371
<i>- What's happening?
- We're being rallied by a{ young} strumpet.</i>

13:51.574 --> 13:53.556
- Who's on the speaker phone?
- That's Phil.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.234
He's agoraphobic,
so he can't go outside.

13:56.359 --> 13:58.587
But he watches the corner
of Wilton and Delancy for us.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.288
That's just the kind of dedication
we're looking for.

14:01.413 --> 14:03.795
Together, we can render
McFreely powerless,

14:03.920 --> 14:05.758
forcing him to resign in shame.

14:06.018 --> 14:09.931
And this is how we're gonna do it.
With some unscheduled maintenance.

14:10.402 --> 14:13.365
- Vandalism?!
- Constructive vandalism.

14:13.616 --> 14:15.979
We're gonna put our neighborhood
back the way it was.

14:18.934 --> 14:22.007
Listen to them cheering. I think
they forgot about the bosom thing.

14:22.132 --> 14:24.503
- They did. Don't bring it up again.
- I won't.

14:25.612 --> 14:26.406
Bosom.

14:43.435 --> 14:45.903
<i>- What's that pounding?
- We're using you as a hammer.</i>

14:46.028 --> 14:47.973
<i>I'm part of the team!</i>

14:52.531 --> 14:54.184
This is taking too long.

14:54.309 --> 14:56.607
On the next house,
maybe we skip the primer

14:56.732 --> 15:00.439
- and just do a coat of paint.
- Hey, I take pride in what I do.

15:01.558 --> 15:03.515
I'm a little ashamed
of you right now.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.953
Slowly... Slowly...

15:22.517 --> 15:25.404
- Don't trigger that light.
- I know how to pull a rope.

15:25.529 --> 15:28.294
<i>I won threeBattle
of the Network Stars.</i>

15:28.604 --> 15:30.470
I used to be Gabe Kaplan.

15:36.452 --> 15:38.697
<i>You know what would be funny?
Put the flag up.</i>

15:38.822 --> 15:41.564
<i>The mailman will think
they've got outgoing mail.</i>

15:41.689 --> 15:43.868
That's a great idea, Speakerphone.

16:01.909 --> 16:03.879
Constructive vandalism?!

16:04.047 --> 16:05.590
Charles, how does my morning look?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.587
You have cereal
and cartoons till 10:00.

16:07.712 --> 16:08.647
No can do.

16:08.772 --> 16:10.652
Summon the gardeners immediately.

16:10.777 --> 16:12.392
Time to get some payback.

16:12.517 --> 16:14.413
To the bathroom, princess style.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.320
The roses!

16:18.445 --> 16:20.945
McFreely and his thugs
killed our roses!

16:21.454 --> 16:23.374
Every petal shall be avenged.

16:23.499 --> 16:25.808
We're gonna fight back
with everything we've got.

16:25.933 --> 16:29.305
She's right. And besides,
I have nothing left to live for.

16:29.430 --> 16:32.407
- We have a child.
- Can't I be dramatic for five seconds?!

17:05.329 --> 17:08.818
They send one of ours to the hospital,
we send one of theirs to the morgue.

17:11.132 --> 17:13.045
Damn it, McFreely!
How could you do this?!

17:13.170 --> 17:15.784
McFreely didn't kill him, Dad.
He died of old age.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.851
Well, if McFreely isn't responsible
for this, what's his next move?

17:18.976 --> 17:20.909
<i>- I think I know.
- Yes, Speakerphone?</i>

17:21.034 --> 17:22.230
<i>Hello, morons.</i>

17:22.717 --> 17:23.905
It's McFreely.

17:24.030 --> 17:27.185
<i>I think it's time for Speakerphone
to get a little fresh air.</i>

17:27.310 --> 17:30.235
<i>Guys, they're taking me out
on the veranda!</i>

17:31.142 --> 17:34.719
<i>Oh God, I can smell the grass!</i>

17:35.452 --> 17:36.971
Hang on, Speakerphone!

17:37.632 --> 17:40.308
We already lost Old Guy,
we're not losing Speakerphone.

17:40.503 --> 17:41.935
Dad, they have names.

17:42.104 --> 17:45.450
There's no time for names!
Come on, Jugs, Nerd, Gays... to the van!

17:52.601 --> 17:56.297
- Phil, we're here.
- Take me back in the house... please!

17:59.037 --> 18:01.470
Terry, hang back for a second.
I gotta ask you something.

18:01.595 --> 18:05.025
- Did you picture Speakerphone as...
- No, no, not at all.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.168
Me, neither.
I was super surprised.

18:07.459 --> 18:09.472
<i>Dije "Esta no es mi barca!"</i>

18:16.068 --> 18:19.242
Let me in, you sons of bitches!
I'll kill all your families!

18:21.125 --> 18:24.137
Good news. I've trapped
the Mexicans in the house.

19:15.716 --> 19:17.405
See you later, boys.

19:23.741 --> 19:24.912
Sweet move.

19:32.434 --> 19:35.130
You should've bought the grenadine.
It was on the list.

19:35.255 --> 19:37.252
It was unnecessary.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.376
You think everything I want
is unnecessary.

19:39.501 --> 19:42.368
You wouldn't let me adopt a rabbit.
You never let me watchThe Hills.

19:42.493 --> 19:45.365
You wouldn't let me get
that Gael Garcia Bernal poster.

19:45.490 --> 19:48.227
His eyes are green and he's Latin.
I need it!

19:48.487 --> 19:51.731
So, Mr. Tyrant, prepare to drink
a Roy Rogers.

19:52.763 --> 19:55.413
No! I hate those!
Get off me, you fat hag!

19:57.908 --> 19:59.258
This cola's warm.

19:59.383 --> 20:02.526
It's been in my pants for three weeks,
serving as my meaty parts.

20:02.651 --> 20:03.910
Sad to see it go, really.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.236
Good job, Hayley!

20:08.640 --> 20:11.668
Stop!
I got a sheet of acid in my pocket.

20:12.948 --> 20:14.963
Not until you resign
from the Association.

20:15.265 --> 20:18.424
Not until I get a say at home.
I want to be heard.

20:18.687 --> 20:21.435
Dad, you know how you felt
when you had no say in the neighborhood?

20:21.560 --> 20:24.081
That's how Roger feels at home
all the time.

20:26.410 --> 20:29.269
If I give you a say,
you promise you'll resign?

20:29.547 --> 20:31.104
Yes, yes, I promise!

20:33.925 --> 20:36.502
Well, Stan, I guess
it makes no difference now.

20:38.343 --> 20:40.342
It was me, Roger, the whole time.

21:09.605 --> 21:12.117
<i>{pos(192,40}Damn, hombre, you can dance.</i>

21:13.117 --> 21:15.117
We insert new subtitle, in position 339 (last node)

00:00.500 --> 00:13.000
