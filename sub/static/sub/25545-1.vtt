00:58.976 --> 01:00.774
<i>This is how it started.</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:03.105
<i>Four best friends and a book.</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:06.074
<i>Vivian was the one who had the idea.</i>

01:06.149 --> 01:07.776
<i>She'd seen it in a magazine,</i>

01:07.859 --> 01:09.702
<i>and it was that very first book</i>

01:09.778 --> 01:11.621
<i>that gave her a lifelong philosophy.</i>

01:12.698 --> 01:14.826
You know what
I find sexiest about you?

01:15.617 --> 01:16.584
Do tell.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.037
You don't need me.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.542
I don't need anyone.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.465
It's the secret to my success.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.589
<i>And successful she was.</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:27.588
<i>The hotel we were standing
in front of...</i>

01:27.671 --> 01:28.638
<i>...she owns.</i>

01:28.714 --> 01:29.966
<i>And ten years later,</i>

01:30.048 --> 01:32.267
<i>she tore it down
and built a new one.</i>

01:33.468 --> 01:35.391
Good morning, Miss O'Donnell.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.069
Yeah, I'll call you back.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.650
Slim?

01:47.733 --> 01:49.110
<i>This is Arthur.</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:52.370
<i>The first time they had sex
was on a mix board.</i>

01:52.821 --> 01:54.323
<i>They were madly in love.</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:55.532
<i>He proposed.</i>

01:55.949 --> 01:57.326
<i>She said no.</i>

01:57.409 --> 01:58.501
<i>He left town.</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:01.754
My, 0h, my.

02:01.830 --> 02:02.877
Arthur Riley.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.879
What's it been, 40 years?

02:05.751 --> 02:08.470
That's impossible.
That would mean I was only six.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.422
- Still a wiseass?
- Yeah.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.804
Old habits die hard.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.264
I got to get back
to this meeting, but,

02:15.344 --> 02:16.971
are you going to be
in town for a while?

02:17.054 --> 02:19.307
I would hope so. I do live here.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.686
I'll find you.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.601
It's good to see you, Slim.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.988
<i>Now, Sharon
was Vivian's roommate</i>

02:27.064 --> 02:28.611
<i>as an undergrad at Stanford.</i>

02:28.940 --> 02:30.783
<i>- Then she went to law school.</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:34.246
<i>Of the 301 people
in her graduating class,</i>

02:34.613 --> 02:35.956
<i>62 were women.</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:39.160
<i>Of the 62,
one became a federal judge.</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:47.342
He's on the phone now?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.256
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take

02:49.336 --> 02:51.009
a five-minute recess.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.385
All rise.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.014
This court will stand
in recess for five minutes.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.889
No, no, no.
You're never interrupting.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.223
How is Hawaii?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.689
You got en-- engaged?

03:04.768 --> 03:07.066
Why? I mean, wow!

03:07.145 --> 03:09.523
I didn't mean "why,"
I meant "wow." Wow.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.827
Well, if I sound judgmental, that...

03:13.902 --> 03:15.074
That's a professional hazard.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.989
Who's Cheryl?

03:19.241 --> 03:22.495
I didn't know
your father was seeing someone.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.295
Good for him.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.248
And you. Good for both...

03:26.331 --> 03:28.629
Congratulations all around. Yeah.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.337
<i>In 1985, Sharon married Tom</i>

03:31.420 --> 03:32.888
<i>because he made her laugh.</i>

03:32.963 --> 03:35.591
<i>By 1999, she was no longer laughing.</i>

03:35.674 --> 03:37.893
<i>And the final straw came
when Tom asked her</i>

03:37.968 --> 03:39.766
<i>what “Don Quix-ote" was about.</i>

03:40.303 --> 03:42.271
<i>The marriage ended
and Sharon bought a cat.</i>

03:43.974 --> 03:46.102
<i>Carol put herself
through culinary school,</i>

03:46.184 --> 03:48.232
<i>working as a waitress at a diner.</i>

03:50.689 --> 03:52.691
<i>She had two goals in life:</i>

03:53.316 --> 03:56.820
<i>one, to own and operate
her own restaurant,</i>

03:56.903 --> 04:01.329
<i>and two, to marry the man
of her dreams, Bruce Colby.</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:03.035
<i>Since the moment they met,</i>

04:03.118 --> 04:05.837
<i>they've not been able to
keep their hands off each other.</i>

04:05.912 --> 04:08.165
Ooh!
- Happy anniversary.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.876
Happy anniversary.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.005
Dance lessons!

04:14.087 --> 04:15.680
Yep.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.132
- Wow.
- Yes.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.343
Because the No Kid Hungry fundraiser

04:19.426 --> 04:22.646
is a talent show this year
and I signed us up.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.148
- To be in the talent show?
- Yes!

04:25.223 --> 04:27.351
I thought it was something fun
we could do together

04:27.434 --> 04:28.811
now that you're retired.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.317
Now this is gorgeous!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.616
Eargasms!

04:36.234 --> 04:37.736
Yeah, I got us both a pair.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.247
Multiple Eargasms.
Who does not love that?

04:41.323 --> 04:45.373
Well, no, it's so you can watch TV
in bed without disturbing me,

04:45.452 --> 04:47.705
and my snoring
won't keep you awake.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.462
That's very thoughtful.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.924
What do you say we get home and...

04:55.003 --> 04:56.971
- I say yes.
- Yay.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.766
<i>And then, there's me.</i>

05:03.845 --> 05:06.189
<i>I didn't know what my path
was going to be,</i>

05:06.264 --> 05:08.687
<i>and then it hit me,
with a wave of nausea.</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:11.611
<i>Because of this guy,
Harry Whittaker.</i>

05:11.978 --> 05:13.901
<i>We got married, and I became a...</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:15.448
- Mom!
- What?

05:15.524 --> 05:16.821
Stop already.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.245
What? No!
I just need to clear the caulk.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.823
- Clear the caulk?
- Yes.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.785
There's a cute little ladybug
trying to get out the window.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.461
Okay, someone's been watching
way too much HGTV.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.790
Mom, put the screwdriver down.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.256
What?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.675
Mom.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.922
- We've been talking.
- Yes?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.003
We want to move you to Arizona.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.761
Move me? My God.
What am I, cattle?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.059
<i>These are our two daughters.</i>

05:42.133 --> 05:46.104
<i>Harry is an accountant.
Well, he was an accountant.</i>

05:46.429 --> 05:48.431
Your house is falling apart,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.188
and you don't have Dad to fix it.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.520
I know, but, my friends,
they live here.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.485
And your family lives there.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.191
We just want you close t0 us, Mom.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.196
No, but...

05:58.275 --> 06:01.245
- Feel it out for the weekend.
- If not for you, for us, please.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.447
- It's what Dad would've wanted.
- All right.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.624
<i>Well,
it's been over 40 years</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:09.545
<i>and through it all, every month,
we still get together for...</i>

06:12.080 --> 06:14.549
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Arthur as in Arthur?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.877
Wait a minute.
Are you talking about...

06:16.960 --> 06:19.930
-radio-station-sex Arthur?
- Yes!

06:20.005 --> 06:21.757
Proposed-with-a-milkshake Arthur.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.684
That Arthur.
And he's staying at the hotel.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.727
Does he not hate you, though?
He's got to.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.646
<i>No. Thai was M) years aged.!</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:31.020
Yeah, but still.
There she is.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.025
My son is engaged
and my husband is in Maui

06:36.104 --> 06:38.232
with a tartlet named Cheryl.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.617
I need a drink.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.319
Your "husband"?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.155
You can't possibly still care
about what Tom is doing.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.615
I don't care.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.666
But the guy gets seasick
in a swimming pool.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.619
I mean, what the hell
is he doing in Maui?

06:51.119 --> 06:53.497
Sounds like he's
doing Cheryl in Maui.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.048
Please.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.835
Who gets involved
in a relationship at 67?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.420
I mean, what is the point?

06:59.502 --> 07:02.426
The point is to get laid.
It's always the point.

07:02.881 --> 07:06.476
- Don't make me sick.
- Who still says "get laid“?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.019
Who still has any interest?

07:08.094 --> 07:10.973
No, no, no. I am not gonna
let us become those people.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.354
- What people...
- You know what people.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.027
The people who stop living
before they stop living.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.979
I haven't had sex since my divorce

07:18.063 --> 07:20.737
and it's been the happiest
18 years of my life.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.616
That must be
some kind of record.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.119
I mean, what even happens
to a vagina after 18 years?

07:28.198 --> 07:30.667
I think Werner Herzog
did a documentary on that.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.461
Yeah. It's called
The Cave of Forgotten Dreams.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.880
Okay! Will you stop it?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.209
Moving on.
Let's talk about the book.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.544
God. The hiking book? Really?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.675
Come on! I liked it!

07:42.754 --> 07:46.179
It's such a remarkable undertaking.
Can you imagine?

07:46.257 --> 07:50.057
No, I cannot. I don't even
like walking to my mailbox.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.434
It's just an amazing story.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.233
So many layers. I wouldn't
even know how to break it down.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.685
I'll break it down for you.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.611
She hikes, she lost her boot,
she did heroin.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.189
Did you only read the back cover?

08:00.271 --> 08:01.523
I wish.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.404
I kept wanting to shout at her,

08:03.483 --> 08:06.407
"Wait ten years, honey.
Dry shampoo is coming."

08:06.486 --> 08:08.488
If you would ever
connect with something

08:08.571 --> 08:10.118
on a more emotional level...

08:10.198 --> 08:12.542
Emotional connection
is highly overrated.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.962
You have not had an emotional
connection for 4O years.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.586
Wow, that must be
some type of record.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.793
Yeah, but what happens
to emotions after 4O years?

08:20.875 --> 08:23.298
Okay, okay,
are you guys having fun?

08:23.378 --> 08:26.097
Come on.
You know we love you.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.845
Maybe it's time
you did take a hike

08:27.924 --> 08:30.018
and try to reconnect
with your own true self.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.436
I'll buy you a backpack.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.230
I'll tell you how to reconnect
with your own true self,

08:34.304 --> 08:36.649
and it ain't by walking alone
through the desert.

08:37.392 --> 08:41.738
I would like to introduce you
to Christian Grey.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.698
No.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.776
It was a bestseller
made into a movie.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.033
- That is our theme this year.
- Wow.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.864
We are not reading this.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.073
It's my month!

08:52.157 --> 08:53.955
When it's your month,
you can choose whatever

08:54.034 --> 08:55.627
boring, depressing book you want.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.205
I'm not sure
this qualifies <i>as</i> a book.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.131
Well, 50 million people
can't be wrong.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.085
To-- To even be holding
this book is embarrassing.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.886
Who's judging you, your cat?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.430
I do like the idea of a romance.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.599
We are too old!

09:09.674 --> 09:12.427
But it says right here
"for mature audiences.“

09:12.510 --> 09:14.308
Yeah, that certainly sounds like us.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.392
We started this book club
to stimulate our minds.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.729
Well, from what I hear,
this book is quite stimulating.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.778
God.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.073
So... come on!

09:25.148 --> 09:27.526
- Let's toast to our new book.
- All right.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.611
- Good.
- Drink up. Hoist that glass.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.992
- Yeah.
- Happy reading, ladies!

09:37.619 --> 09:39.041
God.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.123
Okay.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.348
My...

09:50.423 --> 09:51.766
I didn't...

09:51.841 --> 09:53.843
I'm really so terribly...

09:54.177 --> 09:55.645
I'm so sorry.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.688
'Can 'can

09:58.848 --> 10:01.067
- You need some help?
- I'm sorry. No, I'm fine.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.440
I really didn't mean to disturb you.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.272
- Too late.
- I know, I know.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.321
Wow.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.322
It's... This is so humiliating.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.742
- Are you okay?
- I'm ...

10:13.822 --> 10:15.995
- I'm really scared of flying.
- You shouldn't be.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.878
Yeah, well,
I won't be once these...

10:20.703 --> 10:22.455
kick into my bloodstream.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.041
The safest way to travel.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.752
- Want to know why you think that?
- Why?

10:26.835 --> 10:30.089
Because you never met anybody
who's been in a plane crash.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.593
- And you want to know why?
- Why?

10:31.673 --> 10:33.220
Because they're all dead.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.058
I think those pills
are affecting you already.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.232
I think so.
My God.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.853
What-- What takes you to Arizona?

10:41.933 --> 10:43.435
My...

10:43.893 --> 10:45.520
My daughters live there.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.071
Well, that should be fun.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.490
Not exactly.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.275
They're kind of forcing me to go.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.359
Why?

10:51.943 --> 10:53.536
Well...

10:54.487 --> 10:58.082
my husband, he died last year, so...

10:58.992 --> 11:00.289
Plane crash?

11:00.368 --> 11:03.167
You didn't say that.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.924
- Sorry, that was a bad joke.
- That's okay.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.593
- I'm really sorry for your loss.
- I'm sorry, too. No, well...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.966
Thank you, that's sweet.
Thank you so much.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.048
Yeah...

11:13.131 --> 11:14.383
Hey!

11:16.801 --> 11:18.678
I'm sorry. My God.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.809
This is terrible.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.065
- Wow.
- I'm so...

11:23.141 --> 11:26.145
That was the jet bridge
and we're still on the ground.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.983
- We're still on the ground?
- Yeah.

11:28.062 --> 11:31.236
I'm so terribly sorry.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.491
- I'm quite all right.
- Okay.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.993
Anything I can do to make
your flight more comfortable.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.200
I appreciate that,
thank you so much.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.592
Jesus.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.600
Wow.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.315
on...

12:11.606 --> 12:12.698
Okay.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.527
Give me a break, okay?

12:16.361 --> 12:17.533
This...

12:18.696 --> 12:19.743
Whoa!

12:23.409 --> 12:25.878
My God, yes.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.043
You know, I was wondering.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.094
That must have been one heck
of a book you were reading.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.387
May I ask what it was?

12:35.964 --> 12:38.092
- Moby <i>Dick. That's what it was.
- Moby Dick.</i>

12:38.174 --> 12:39.926
Melville.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.767
I didn't realize Christian Grey
had a nickname.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.938
- Enjoy Arizona.
- Yeah, sure, of course.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.394
Not a problem.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.282
<i>Miss O'Donnell,
I have an Arthur Riley for you.</i>

13:02.407 --> 13:03.704
Is that so'?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.169
Take a message.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.376
Take a message?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.626
Really?

13:11.666 --> 13:13.259
I didn't realize that...

13:13.334 --> 13:14.631
that you were here.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.464
We just saw each other
in the lobby two days ago.

13:18.339 --> 13:21.434
Pity. They say the memory
is the second thing to go.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.389
- What's the first thing to go?
- Can't remember.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.393
I'm impressed.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.524
- How did you find me?
- Google.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.401
- Google?
- Yeah. It's a service on the computer.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.777
Yeah, I know Google.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.781
Well, I'm younger than you,
so I didn't know...

13:38.860 --> 13:41.329
Cute. Cute.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.872
What do you say?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.824
May a gentleman buy you
a cup of coffee?

13:44.907 --> 13:47.035
Well, a gentleman certainly may.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.536
Do you know of one?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.756
It was the mid-'80s.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.006
I became obsessed
with risk management.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.928
You obsessed with work?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.051
That's crazy.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.633
I know, right? Shocking!

14:01.716 --> 14:06.187
I could see the system
was set up for trouble.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.435
Of course, none of the men
in my firm believed me.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.939
Well, men can be
a little slow on the uptake.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.316
Bad for them, good for me.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.022
And, um...

14:16.564 --> 14:18.862
you never picked up
a husband along the way?

14:20.902 --> 14:21.994
No!

14:22.987 --> 14:25.456
Like I said, I'm way too good...

14:25.907 --> 14:27.580
at forecasting risk.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.205
I figure by now, I've saved myself

14:29.285 --> 14:31.538
-a lot of money in legal fees.
- True dat.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.417
How about you?
ls there a Mrs. Riley?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.127
Yes.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.171
The good Mrs. Riley
is back on the East Coast,

14:40.254 --> 14:43.758
having absconded with
my last name, my dog,

14:43.841 --> 14:45.684
and my co-op on the park.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.436
What did you do wrong?

14:47.512 --> 14:48.889
Well, let's just say

14:48.971 --> 14:52.225
I was a little <i>less</i> good
at assessing risk.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.494
Whoa! Torn, talk about
false advertising.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.796
Whoa!

15:22.171 --> 15:23.218
<i>Jesus.</i>

15:23.297 --> 15:25.095
<i>Join Tom
and Cheryl and millions of others</i>

15:25.174 --> 15:26.471
<i>who found love on Bumble.</i>

15:26.551 --> 15:31.022
Join Tom and Cheryl <i>as</i> they
copulate in a coconut tree.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.474
- Judge Meyers?
- Yes.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.980
Hi. It's 12:15.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.946
Well, I really have
to stay with this, so, urn...

15:39.730 --> 15:42.825
If you could just tell them that we have
to move it to next week, please.

15:42.900 --> 15:43.947
Of course. Yeah.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.573
<i>Rev up your love life</i>

15:45.653 --> 15:47.030
<i>with these tips from Bumble--</i>

15:47.113 --> 15:49.616
<i>Make love happen now
and change your life--</i>

15:49.699 --> 15:51.201
Do you need anything else,
Your Honor?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.753
<i>A man
of your dreams is just a click away.</i>

15:53.828 --> 15:55.000
No, I don't. I'm fine.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.581
- Thank you.
- Yep.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.678
Here you go.
Make a wish.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.928
What are you doing?

16:07.008 --> 16:08.055
I made a wish.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.181
What did you wish for?

16:09.260 --> 16:11.854
I always wish for the same thing:
a healthy planet.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.768
That's not your wish.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.942
That's not even a wish!

16:16.017 --> 16:18.520
Wishes have to be personal,
not global.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.605
- Since when?
- Since forever.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.781
And secondly, you can't
tell anybody your wish.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.783
Otherwise it negates the whole thing.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.703
No, God, you're not gonna
go in there. Don't do that.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.158
Well, somebody has to.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.869
You made an improper wish

16:33.951 --> 16:35.874
and you've jeopardized
the entire planet.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.123
God, you are insane.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.254
You are insane! Don't go in!

16:41.751 --> 16:42.968
I have no choice here.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.671
You're obviously the type of person

16:44.754 --> 16:47.223
who's too delicate
to go in after her own penny.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.887
You think I'm delicate?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.558
See? Delicate.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.141
You know, what you're reading
as delicate is this.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.148
It's this bracelet
that costs as much as a car!

16:59.227 --> 17:00.604
Let's see that bracelet.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.154
- No. Not my phone--
- Dear!

17:02.230 --> 17:03.903
- Dear.
- No, no. Boy.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.700
- Now you have done it.
- What do you mean?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.529
God, it's scary how addicted
you kids are to your phone.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.909
No, give it to me!

17:10.988 --> 17:12.786
Hold on one second here!

17:12.865 --> 17:14.992
I've never seen...

17:15.076 --> 17:18.171
You know, I think you might need
to talk to someone about this.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.589
I see why you lost
your co-op on the park.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.964
- I hope that's waterproof.
- No.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.393
- No bathing in the fountain.
- Okay!

17:32.468 --> 17:34.220
But technically, we're not bathing.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.977
- Arthur.
- And she started it.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.730
He doesn't care who started it!
It was him.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.478
- Out.
- All right.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.939
Wait a minute.

17:45.273 --> 17:48.117
- I found it.
- That's so great.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.445
Did you see that?

17:50.861 --> 17:53.614
Would you mind just taking a photo?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.167
I hate my life.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.957
It might take a little bit of time,

18:03.040 --> 18:04.963
but you're gonna love it
here in Arizona.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.589
- I don't--
- Let's face it...

18:06.669 --> 18:08.842
You being here
makes more sense for all of us.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.845
We can't jump on a plane
every time something happens to you.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.642
What are you talking about,
"happens to me"?

18:13.718 --> 18:15.516
You could slip and fall
at any moment.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.643
I don't want to overstate the dangers

18:17.722 --> 18:19.941
for a woman your age living alone,

18:20.016 --> 18:22.610
but I did research online,
and it's pretty alarming.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.188
But you do know, I mean,
I'm really not that old.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.945
Well, no, you're not, Mom,
but neither was Dad.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.818
I know, honey, I know.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.992
I need a coffee.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.287
Well, the good coffee
is all the way upstairs.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.909
Mom, why don't you wait down here?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.161
Wait down here? Sure.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.618
God forbid, I can't go up
an escalator at my age.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.170
But hurry back. I could slip and fall
at any moment.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.872
- Just sit there, Mommy.
- Ooh!

18:42.955 --> 18:45.834
- I'll get you a chamomile?
- God. Yeah, thanks.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.759
Be careful!

18:51.464 --> 18:53.387
They brought
the kids to see you?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.013
- Yeah.
- That's good.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.470
God, what?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.687
<i>- Hello.
- Have you ever been spanked?</i>

19:01.766 --> 19:04.064
- What?
- As an adult, sexually.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.147
I mean, is this
what people are doing?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.652
Carol, it's Diane.
You dialed the wrong number.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.609
No. Have you not read the book?

19:11.692 --> 19:13.410
<i>Yes. I've read it.
Of course I have.</i>

19:13.486 --> 19:15.830
<i>- And?
- I don't know who her lawyer is,</i>

19:15.905 --> 19:17.828
<i>but she should not have
signed that contract.</i>

19:17.907 --> 19:19.705
Look, clearly,
we have things to discuss.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.912
I'm gonna call
an emergency book club.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.213
That means you got to
get back here, pronto.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.461
I'd come back
for an emergency colonoscopy,

19:26.540 --> 19:28.918
but it's just a little bit
more complicated here.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.754
God. How is life in Scottsdale?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.890
Well, I don't know, I feel like I'm...

19:34.965 --> 19:38.344
...in an episode of The Walking Dead.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.021
Wait a second. You sound
out of breath. Where are you?

19:41.097 --> 19:44.567
I'm going to a...
a dance rehearsal and I'm late.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.736
- You're late? You're never late.
- I know!

19:46.811 --> 19:49.405
This book has got me
in a total tizzy. Just get back here.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.528
I'll get back there. Bye.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.366
- Wow.
- Chin up.

19:57.655 --> 20:01.876
And one, two, three.
Go, two, three.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.125
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three. Wait.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.626
"- Stop!
- ,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.834
Stop, stop, stop!

20:10.292 --> 20:12.841
Honey, I think we're supposed
to go this way.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.921
To the left.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.722
Right. Which is what I did.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.051
His left. This way.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.520
Back, two, three.
Side, two, three.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.098
Okay, I got it. I was wrong.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.854
I was wrong, you were right.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.480
My little Fred Astaire.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.437
I will follow you
wherever you want to go.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.614
- How about lunch?
- We start again.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.487
You know what? I'm wondering...

20:33.566 --> 20:35.034
Do you think it would be
possible for us

20:35.109 --> 20:37.578
to just skip straight
to our choreography?

20:38.404 --> 20:41.578
We must first learn... to dance!

20:42.366 --> 20:43.913
Right. I know.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.917
But I sort of do know
how to dance. Come on, I do.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.795
I still remember
the whole tap dance

20:49.874 --> 20:51.672
to "Red, Red Robin Goes
Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along“

20:51.751 --> 20:53.378
that I did when I was six.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.259
It's like savant-ish.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.931
Sounds like you peaked early.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.304
What?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.260
- What did she say?
- You're asking me?

21:01.761 --> 21:06.562
So, what is going on
with little Ginsburg here?

21:07.475 --> 21:10.695
Well, she's not herself lately.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.864
She... She has no energy.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.158
She's really lost the spark of life.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.110
She's just kind of blah.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.697
It sounds like we have
a lethargic pussy on our hands.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.239
Seriously?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.333
Have there been
any changes at home?

21:24.408 --> 21:26.786
Any new people or pets
moving in or out?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.462
At home? God, no.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.881
There hasn't been
a change at home forever.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.378
And what about diet?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.049
I've tried a few, but I like to eat.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.678
So whatever weight I take off,
I put right back on, so...

21:39.757 --> 21:41.634
it's useless.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.435
You're talking about the cat.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.684
I am a veterinarian.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.765
I knew that.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.319
<i>Would the passenger in</i> seat <i>17-D</i>

21:51.393 --> 21:52.940
<i>please report to the cockpit?</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:55.523
<i>I repeat, the passenger in seat 17-D,</i>

21:55.606 --> 21:58.450
<i>please report to the cockpit.
Thank you.</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:03.910
Hi.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.243
I just need a little bit
more information from you.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.673
Urn, we need phone numbers,
home and cell.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.874
And cell...

22:13.958 --> 22:15.926
Also, a current home address.

22:16.627 --> 22:17.799
What, really?

22:18.963 --> 22:20.556
Okay.

22:20.631 --> 22:24.511
Also, an email and whatever
nights you are typically free.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.186
You...

22:26.262 --> 22:27.684
You've got to be kidding me.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.811
Pilots, we never kid
about things like this.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.103
No!
Wait, I don't understand.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.438
- What are you doing here?
- Flying the plane, I think.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.398
So, you're a pilot?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.700
I think so. They gave me the hat.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.152
My God.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.495
Thank you.

22:45.823 --> 22:49.248
This is how you ask someone
for their number?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.499
Not usually,
but you are very special.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.214
Can I take you to dinner?

22:54.290 --> 22:55.837
My God.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.008
What's going on here?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.836
I think what I'm doing
is asking you to dinner.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.092
- But what is the beeping?
- It's an alarm.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.048
Yeah, but what does that
actually mean?

23:03.132 --> 23:05.476
Usually, an alarm means
there's something wrong.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.895
- Go fix it!
- I can't, I'm in the middle of something.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.144
Let's just cut this short
Do something. Just do something.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.021
I can't, until we figure
this dinner thing out.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.821
Okay, fine! Yeah, what the hell.
Just get the hell back in there!

23:20.065 --> 23:21.738
Okay, here's the alarm.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.154
I will call you.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.201
My God.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.964
This book! I mean, the things
Christian does to her!

23:35.039 --> 23:37.633
My God! It's absurd.

23:37.708 --> 23:41.679
I could have put him in jail
for any one of those things.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.756
But she sure was having fun.

23:43.839 --> 23:44.965
Yes, she was.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.760
It's not like we don't have fun.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.937
No, but it's a different kind of fun.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.935
- Very different.
- Like this.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.399
- This is fun.
- For sure.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.691
I just can't stop thinking about
when he snuck her off

23:57.770 --> 24:01.024
and he gave it to her right there
in the boathouse, you know?

24:01.106 --> 24:02.653
- The boathouse.
- Yeah.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.827
Do you think anyone
our age still goes...

24:05.027 --> 24:06.654
Hi, beautiful friends!

24:06.737 --> 24:08.739
Yeah, I think some people do.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.959
Let me guess.
You saw Arthur again.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.791
I did, I did. We had coffee.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.213
And you slept with him.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.790
God, no!

24:17.873 --> 24:21.594
Although I have to admit,
he's still very charming and fun.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.296
So you find him charming and fun,

24:23.379 --> 24:25.222
but you didn't sleep with him.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.549
Exactly.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.726
I don't sleep with people I like.
You know that.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.475
- I gave that up in the '90s.
- You make no sense.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.349
I make perfect sense.

24:34.431 --> 24:35.899
Now, now, now, now.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.728
Tell me what is going on.
Tell me everything.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.734
You are too happy. I don't like this.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.652
Okay.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.449
- Best book ever!
- Yes!

24:44.525 --> 24:45.993
What is going on?

24:46.068 --> 24:47.741
Yeah. No, wait.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.242
Imagine this, okay?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.371
Um, so, me sitting on a plane,

24:52.449 --> 24:54.543
you know,
reading our little book...

24:54.618 --> 24:58.623
and, well, this, um,
devilishly handsome man...

24:58.706 --> 25:00.800
My God, is this going
where I hope it is?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.878
Yes, it is. You know what he did?
He asked me out to dinner.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.255
Well, that's not exactly...

25:06.338 --> 25:08.261
- Shh!
- You met a man on an airplane?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.593
Yeah, and guess what? A pilot!

25:12.011 --> 25:13.513
Love a man in uniform.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.438
Your husband just died!

25:15.514 --> 25:18.859
Harry. Yeah.
My goodness. He was...

25:18.934 --> 25:19.981
He was such a good man.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.438
That was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.149
Harry dying was the best thing that
ever happened to her?

25:25.232 --> 25:28.236
Yeah, 'cause now she can have sex
with somebody who's not an accountant.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.070
Wait a minute. Are you crazy?

25:30.154 --> 25:31.531
Sex? Forget about it.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.581
I don't even remember
how to have sex. No way!

25:33.657 --> 25:35.250
Don't worry, it'll all come back.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.077
It's just like riding a bicycle.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.000
Except instead of riding a bicycle,

25:39.079 --> 25:40.376
you have sex with a man.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.881
Note to self: Watch Carol
ride a bicycle someday.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.836
If you need a refresher,

25:45.919 --> 25:48.718
I know somebody who sure
does know how to have sex.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.674
I don't know what that is,
but I'll tell you one thing:

25:50.758 --> 25:51.930
it is definitely not sex, okay?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.556
No, you're right, that's not sex.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.729
That's crazy hot sex.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.732
Can we please stop saying "sex"?

25:58.807 --> 26:00.650
What do you prefer, “make love"?

26:00.726 --> 26:03.149
"I don't make love. I f--"

26:03.228 --> 26:04.320
"Hard."

26:04.772 --> 26:06.024
That's what he said.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.608
- My.
- Ooh.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.777
You've completely lost it.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.658
- No, I think she's found it.
- Yeah.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.456
She's found it.
Handcuffed in the red room, right?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.873
- The whip.
- The red room.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.204
Bruce must be having
such fun with all this.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.587
Yes, such fun, actually. Yeah.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.258
What is that?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.295
This book made me realize that

26:28.378 --> 26:31.632
it's been quite a while
since we-- you know.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.809
As in... as in weeks?

26:33.884 --> 26:36.057
Like, maybe six.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.729
- Six weeks?
- Months.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.024
God, I thought you guys
were like rabbits.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.069
We are, if rabbits
took a ton of Benadryl

26:43.143 --> 26:44.611
and made a chastity pact.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.654
My God, we have
to put a stop to this.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.731
Come on.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.034
I mean, if women our age
were meant to have sex,

26:50.109 --> 26:52.362
God wouldn't do
what he does to our bodies.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.412
Whoa! Well, speak for yourself.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.291
That was not God.
That was Dr. Nazarian.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.620
He did a good job.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.214
Hey, everyone.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.916
- Hey!
- What's the topic this month?

27:05.999 --> 27:08.718
<i>- W</i> hat...
<i>- Moby Dick.</i>

27:08.794 --> 27:10.796
Yeah, sounds like fun.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.299
- Carol?
- What?

27:13.382 --> 27:15.976
You are not gonna believe
what I pulled out of the garage.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.519
My old motorcycle.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.397
That poor thing
hasn't been ridden in ages!

27:21.140 --> 27:22.141
Poor thing.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.101
There's a little sag in the cable.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.232
She's still got a gorgeous chassis.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.110
You know, I was thinking
maybe I could lube her up

27:29.189 --> 27:31.157
and get that old gal riding again.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.235
- Yeah, yeah, good idea.
- That's good.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.695
Give her undercarriage a good buff

27:34.778 --> 27:36.655
and slap a little wax on her saddle.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.367
Ooh,
I hope he uses protection.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.669
- Shut <i>up.
- Moby Dick?</i>

27:42.744 --> 27:44.712
- What was that?
- I don't know.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.540
I don't know why my mind
keeps going there.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.590
It's like, duh.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.215
Ladies, this book is a wakeup call.

27:50.294 --> 27:53.013
I don't care what society says
about women our age.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.432
Sex must not be taken off the table.

27:55.507 --> 27:59.353
Hold on. I mean, we are four
smart successful women.

27:59.428 --> 28:00.850
I don't need a man.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.227
I know. You've proved that
for 18 years.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.479
Touché.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.562
No, my point is,
the choice should be ours.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.648
Speaking of which,
we are doubling down.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.530
How about this for a choice?

28:14.610 --> 28:17.033
- Thank God it's a trilogy.
- My God!

28:17.112 --> 28:19.535
- Especially for you, Sharon.
- Thank you <i>so</i> much.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.583
Thank you. Thank you. Ladies?

28:21.658 --> 28:22.625
- What?
- Ladies?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.123
- Yes?
- Yes')

28:24.203 --> 28:28.049
We shall not go gentle
into that good night.

28:29.124 --> 28:34.051
So, let's lube up those bikes
and get riding again!

28:37.174 --> 28:41.350
"I groan and tilt my pelvis
involuntarily against him,

28:41.428 --> 28:43.021
finding a delicious...“

28:45.641 --> 28:48.064
"...a delicious friction..."

28:48.143 --> 28:50.237
This is really something.

28:50.312 --> 28:55.034
"...against the seam of his fly
and his growing erection."

28:56.985 --> 28:59.989
Dear. My God, okay, okay.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.750
- Hello?
- Are you <i>okay?</i>

29:03.825 --> 29:05.293
<i>You were supposed
to call me after dinner.</i>

29:05.369 --> 29:08.248
Yeah, I'm fine, honey. I just finished.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.832
<i>Did</i> you eat alone?

29:10.791 --> 29:12.589
Yes, alone.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.261
<i>God, it's all so sad.</i>

29:14.336 --> 29:16.885
Yeah. Okay, but anyway...

29:17.130 --> 29:20.054
thanks for checking in,
and I really should get to bed.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.931
<i>Remember,
we can put you in the basement</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:23.227
<i>whenever you're ready.</i>

29:23.303 --> 29:24.805
Okay.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.063
Whoa.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.564
I mean...

29:31.353 --> 29:32.821
Wow, wow.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.825
Hello!

29:37.901 --> 29:39.494
<i>Is that really
how you answer the phone?</i>

29:39.569 --> 29:42.368
- All right, who is this?
- I'm gonna hang up now.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.075
Then I'll call you back
and we're gonna try this again.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.788
My God.

29:50.831 --> 29:51.832
It's over.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.464
I can't do anything right,
obviously. Okay.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.801
Hello there!

29:58.880 --> 30:00.848
Hey, hello there. Much better.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.931
Have you had dinner?

30:04.011 --> 30:06.059
<i>I have. Yeah.</i>

30:06.680 --> 30:08.102
How about tomorrow night?

30:08.473 --> 30:09.850
Dinner tomorrow night?

30:09.933 --> 30:11.901
<i>Sounds great.
Thought you'd never ask.</i>

30:12.769 --> 30:14.146
<i>What time should I pick you up?</i>

30:14.896 --> 30:16.614
But I... I really can't, so...

30:17.149 --> 30:19.243
- Why can't you?
- No, <i>I</i> mean--

30:19.318 --> 30:21.867
I mean, of course I can,
but where are you anyway?

30:21.945 --> 30:23.322
<i>I'm in Sedona.</i>

30:23.405 --> 30:25.954
But I'm in... 
I'm in Santa Monica, so...

30:26.033 --> 30:28.286
I'm aware. I'll pick you up at 6:30.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.837
Well, wait. But you can't
just kind of like...

30:30.912 --> 30:33.461
Actually, I can.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.511
God.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.089
Dear.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.469
Someone make a bad wish?

30:45.552 --> 30:48.772
You should know
I rescue wishes all over town.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.816
Wanna grab a cup of coffee?

30:51.892 --> 30:53.610
I-- I can't today.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.563
Well, I'd like to grab a drink sometime.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.739
We have an excellent bar
on the mezzanine level.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.405
You meant with me?

31:05.489 --> 31:06.957
You're funny.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.209
Okay, it's a date, then.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.498
I love that you have a date!

31:14.581 --> 31:16.458
Yeah, and it's a first date.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.511
So it's important
that you put on something sexy.

31:19.586 --> 31:22.135
I don't own anything sexy.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.592
Don't listen to her.
Just be comfortable.

31:24.674 --> 31:25.926
Be yourself.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.511
Okay. Well, what about...

31:27.594 --> 31:28.720
Does this...

31:30.180 --> 31:32.524
- That's too comfortable.
- Right, yeah, no. No.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.067
Okay, fine.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.190
I can take that to Goodwill for you.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.612
Don't do that to them.

31:37.687 --> 31:38.859
Those people have enough trouble.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.990
- She always does this.
- I know.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.114
She wears these voluminous things

31:43.193 --> 31:45.537
to cover that beautiful figure.
All the time!

31:45.612 --> 31:47.990
- My God!
- 'Yes!

31:48.073 --> 31:50.496
- Perfect! You look great!
- You look perfect.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.452
- Let me see.
- I don't want...

31:52.536 --> 31:55.540
My God, you look so good.
Unbutton one little button here.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.590
- Show off the girls.
- Get off!

31:57.666 --> 31:59.509
Let them out!
No, no, no.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.212
- This is so ridiculous.
- So exciting.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.172
I can't believe how nervous I am.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.509
I am, too.
Do you remember your last date?

32:06.591 --> 32:07.934
We're talking Nixon era.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.057
- Wait, is that helping?
- No.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.973
God.
I need a safe word.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.856
You're gonna be great!
You're gonna be great.

32:17.144 --> 32:20.318
- This is gonna be amazing!
- Let's get to the window.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.281
Just act natural. Showtime!

32:27.112 --> 32:29.581
- Well, hey, you.
- Good, you're home.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.751
- He's wearing jeans.
- I love a man in jeans.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.375
Let me see. Okay...

32:35.454 --> 32:38.458
- He's got a cute tush.
- God!

32:38.540 --> 32:39.541
God.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.134
Um...

32:42.210 --> 32:44.633
- You brought me flowers?
- Here you go.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.591
Thank you so much.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.017
He brought flowers!

32:49.092 --> 32:51.766
I love a man
who brings flowers.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.563
If you don't like them,
blame your neighbors.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.437
- I picked them from their garden.
- You're kidding.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.565
The last time she went
on a date, she got pregnant.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.863
I don't think
that's gonna happen this time.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.205
- He gave up on you.
- I know. That's okay.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.908
- So, where were we?
- Yeah, a bathroom.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.335
A public bathroom?
Like, a public bathroom?

33:15.410 --> 33:17.003
Yeah, like in a park.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.080
- In a park?
- Well, yes, I was 11.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.882
The setting wasn't the first thing
on my mind.

33:20.957 --> 33:21.879
No.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.425
- What about you?
- Me? I don't remember.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.552
Everybody remembers their first kiss.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.258
How about I tell you
about my best kiss?

33:29.341 --> 33:30.888
Maybe that hasn't happened yet.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.436
I see. Well.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.022
My first kiss.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.146
That'd be the sixth grade
and Terry Sanders.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.529
Terry Sanders.
Is that a boy or a girl?

33:42.604 --> 33:44.527
A boy, obviously.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.607
I don't know.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.863
Anyway, it was one
of those Christmas mixers.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.992
Some friends and I,
we snuck backstage.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.664
It was dark, and...

33:52.739 --> 33:56.369
I remember hearing the first
bluesy notes of “At Last."

33:56.451 --> 33:58.294
Remember? By Etta James?

33:58.370 --> 34:02.216
And it came billowing down
through the curtains,

34:02.290 --> 34:06.636
and that is when Terry Sanders
came up to me, and he said...

34:06.711 --> 34:10.681
It was so sweet! He said,
"I think I love you, Dee-Dee."

34:10.757 --> 34:15.388
Yeah, and then he grabbed
my face with both of his hands,

34:15.469 --> 34:17.188
and he was like, I don't know...

34:17.264 --> 34:20.813
Maybe he had seen it
in some movie or something.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.645
But he held my face,
and, for a moment,

34:23.728 --> 34:27.072
my mind went completely blank
in the greatest possible way.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.699
God. I mean, we didn't...

34:29.775 --> 34:32.245
We didn't know
what we were doing, we just...

34:32.320 --> 34:34.572
- Terry knew.
- Maybe, yeah.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.829
We stood there like that, you know...

34:36.908 --> 34:39.786
We just stood there. Frozen.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.340
And you know, I didn't really care.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.382
Because...

34:48.378 --> 34:51.803
the feeling of his hands on my face...

34:52.841 --> 34:54.717
You know what I wish? I wish...

34:55.176 --> 34:57.224
everyone had a first kiss like that.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.140
Yeah.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.355
I'm so sorry.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.981
You know, I don't...

35:04.060 --> 35:07.360
I don't know why I told you
the whole story!

35:07.439 --> 35:10.113
That was a beautiful--
That was a beautiful story.

35:10.734 --> 35:11.986
Thank you.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.117
I wish I was kissed by Terry Sanders.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.041
Where is he? Whatever happened
to Terry Sanders?

35:18.116 --> 35:20.710
- I need to track him down.
- Terry Sanders...

35:20.785 --> 35:22.128
No, what actually happened to him

35:22.203 --> 35:23.796
was that he died in a plane crash.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.465
He died, yeah.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.427
He just went like that.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.175
- Plane crash?
- Yeah.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.056
No.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.140
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.812
He didn't die in a plane crash.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.606
You've been waiting all this time

35:41.681 --> 35:43.934
just to hit me with a plane crash joke.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.314
I couldn't help it.

35:45.393 --> 35:49.114
Diane can get a man
to fly in from another state,

35:49.189 --> 35:52.489
and I can't get my husband
to come in from the garage!

35:52.942 --> 35:54.819
Well, you have to give him
a good enough reason.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.957
Well, since when is sex not
a good enough reason for a man?

35:59.032 --> 36:01.911
Honey, you're not dealing with a man,
you're dealing with an older man.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.791
Different animal.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.918
He's not thinking about sex.
He's conditioned to think

36:05.997 --> 36:09.922
that “inside" means changing
a light bulb or fixing the toilet.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.972
Both of which sound infinitely
more satisfying to me.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.516
So basically, I'm screwed.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.719
Or not screwed, as it were.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.725
He needs a reminder.
Take him back to a time

36:20.804 --> 36:22.431
when sex was on his mind.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.398
- Miss O'Donnell?
- Yeah.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.021
This was dropped
at the desk for you.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.770
- Thank you, Runako.
- You're welcome.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.104
It's Pavlovian.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.689
Present the right stimulus,

36:30.772 --> 36:32.524
you will not believe
how quickly he'll come.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.411
Must you always be so crass?

36:36.486 --> 36:38.284
Look whose mind is in the gutter!

36:38.363 --> 36:40.707
I know!
It's because of this book.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.329
The whipping and the flogging.

36:42.409 --> 36:45.037
I'm learning things no one our age
should even know about!

36:45.120 --> 36:46.588
I mean, sex is...

36:47.789 --> 36:50.133
Not that a little kissing or petting
would kill me, but--

36:50.208 --> 36:51.835
Is that a poncho?

36:52.293 --> 36:54.671
Um... all right, sharing.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.883
"Next time we should wear protection"?

36:58.341 --> 36:59.467
"Love, Arthur."

37:00.135 --> 37:02.888
You weren't gonna
tell us about this.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.689
I told you we went out for coffee.

37:05.056 --> 37:09.106
Unbelievable! That is not
how I go out for coffee.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.863
The entire world is coupling up.

37:11.938 --> 37:15.442
You just need to put yourself
out there the same way Tom did.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.744
You see her going online?

37:17.819 --> 37:19.992
I mean, let's not lose
all our sense of reality.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.448
Well, why not?

37:21.531 --> 37:23.625
There are plenty of fish in the sea

37:23.700 --> 37:25.373
- who would adore her.
- I agree.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.796
But to catch one she'd actually have
to take out a pole

37:27.871 --> 37:29.544
and make her way down to the water.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.499
You really don't think I can do it.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.507
Well, I think you can.
I just don't think you will.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.591
Then let's drink to me
and my pole going online.

37:38.673 --> 37:42.553
- Well, yay! Good for you.
- Yay!

37:42.635 --> 37:44.308
But you might want to lose the pole.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.434
Yeah. Good call.

37:55.231 --> 37:56.699
Life motto?

37:56.775 --> 37:59.244
I'll give you a life motto.

37:59.319 --> 38:05.577
"No one with a life has a motto."

38:09.829 --> 38:10.921
"Find a mate?“

38:10.997 --> 38:14.171
What am I, Lin-Lin the Panda
at the San Diego Zoo?

38:14.250 --> 38:16.173
No! No, no, no.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.597
Stop it!

38:19.672 --> 38:20.798
Shit!

38:26.930 --> 38:29.558
My old uniform. What do you think?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.769
I feel like I'm in a time machine.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.070
I know. And it still fits!

38:34.896 --> 38:36.398
Ta-da!

38:37.565 --> 38:39.613
There's some duct tape on the shelf.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.161
You're sweet, but that
just makes it easier to...

38:43.154 --> 38:46.328
You need--
you need duct tape. Okay...

38:46.866 --> 38:49.540
And, give me the zip ties.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.752
Zip ties.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.297
Are you thinking about tying me up?

38:57.377 --> 38:58.549
What?

38:59.754 --> 39:02.678
Nothing. It's just something
I was reading about.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.727
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

39:06.803 --> 39:08.726
No, I think I'm good, thanks.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.516
I just needed more light

39:11.599 --> 39:13.522
before I can get inside her crankshaft.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.107
Check her out.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.564
Check out... your motorcycle?

39:17.647 --> 39:18.899
Yeah.

39:20.233 --> 39:23.112
- It sure brings back memories.
- Yeah.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.697
And she's a lot prettier
than I remember.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.868
I wouldn't complain
if you want to take me for a ride.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.500
Rain check?

39:36.082 --> 39:39.677
I'm sorry. I talked your ear off.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.380
- I'll recover.
- You will? I wonder.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.386
Just let me know
when you're back in Arizona.

39:45.091 --> 39:49.471
Well, actually, I'm going
to be there this weekend.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.272
How inconvenient.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.941
How inconvenient, yeah.
Anyway...

39:54.517 --> 39:57.487
- It was really lovely.
- It was really lovely. So...

39:57.562 --> 39:59.030
- Good night.
- Have a good night.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.982
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.693
God.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.158
We need to get control
of this situation.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.491
I don't want a repeat
of what was going on

40:09.574 --> 40:11.167
in the evidentiary hearing.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.670
Let's turn our phones off, please.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.497
Not mine.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.717
Am I the only one hearing this?

40:19.792 --> 40:22.466
I believe it's from... over there.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.314
Holy shit.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.127
Here, Ginsburg, you want to go out?

41:08.383 --> 41:09.680
Go.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.602
Go ahead.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.850
Okay, fine.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.103
Be lethargic.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.663
Damn you, E.L. James.

41:36.786 --> 41:40.131
His name is George
and he's probably a serial killer.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.375
No man is perfect.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.426
Well, he's also certainly not normal.

41:44.502 --> 41:48.257
I mean, normal people
don't go trolling for dates online.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.431
You do.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.975
Yeah, I rest my case.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.686
Maybe he's your Christian Grey.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.981
- He's a bald tax attorney.
- Okay, maybe not.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.433
But at least you have a date.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.486
I'm never gonna have sex again
for the rest of my life.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.359
He might not even have arms!

42:03.438 --> 42:04.485
- Hey.
- What?

42:04.564 --> 42:06.066
These are essential.

42:06.149 --> 42:09.119
They hold you in,
smooth everything down. Life changing.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.658
I'm gonna get them for you.
Come here.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.786
Well, let's just say things did not go
exactly <i>as</i> planned.

42:17.452 --> 42:18.999
You've been married too long.

42:19.078 --> 42:21.376
In the army, when they want
to get a soldier's attention,

42:21.456 --> 42:22.878
they just blow on the trumpet.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.380
Well, that is precisely
what I was attempting.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.339
- And the soldier?
- Absent without leave.

42:28.838 --> 42:32.058
In fact, the trumpet never even
came out of the barracks.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.103
The commanding officer
put a kibosh on the mission?

42:35.178 --> 42:37.180
Yes. Mission aborted.

42:37.263 --> 42:40.187
Jesus Christ,
enough with the metaphors already.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.985
My organs just shifted.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.314
You're gonna be fine.
Do scuba breathing.

42:46.105 --> 42:48.904
So, okay, give him one of these...

42:50.276 --> 42:52.654
and the lieutenant
will stand at attention.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.364
You think that's the problem?

42:54.447 --> 42:57.701
I've been doing field research
on this demographic a long time.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.957
He's probably just embarrassed.

43:00.036 --> 43:02.209
This is gonna be
a game changer, trust me.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.125
You need some help?

43:05.208 --> 43:06.881
I need the Jaws of Life.

43:10.671 --> 43:13.220
Um, I don't think
you have that on quite right,

43:13.299 --> 43:14.471
but it's gonna look amazing.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.973
I look like a Lane Bryant mannequin.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.849
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to picture your serial killer

43:20.932 --> 43:22.650
trying to peel you out of that thing.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.978
- He's gonna have to use his teeth.
- If he has teeth.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.488
When you guys are finished joking,

43:27.563 --> 43:28.906
can you get me some scissors?

43:28.981 --> 43:30.574
I can't feel my feet.

43:38.574 --> 43:39.791
Is that the one
I showed you?

43:39.867 --> 43:41.335
No. Found it on Zillow.

43:41.410 --> 43:43.037
Check it out.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.044
- This has a media room.
- Sick.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.500
You don't need a media room,

43:46.582 --> 43:49.005
you need your son to live
in a good school district.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.133
Mom. You shouldn't be adding salt.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.806
It's spaghetti. I always
add salt to my spaghetti.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.600
Mom, did you not get the article
I sent you on blood pressure?

44:01.055 --> 44:04.059
Shoot. Could-- Could you
excuse me forjust a sec?

44:07.854 --> 44:10.607
Don't say “sick". You're 40 years old.

44:11.232 --> 44:12.859
Hi, how are you?

44:13.693 --> 44:16.242
Come visit you? That's crazy!

44:19.657 --> 44:22.957
What? Well, I don't know
how I can do that, you know?

44:23.828 --> 44:25.125
Yeah?

44:25.997 --> 44:28.625
Well, okay.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.255
I'm just gonna have
to come up with a reason.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.087
- Mom?
- I got to go.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.515
Okay, yes, and I will. Okay, bye.

44:36.048 --> 44:38.892
- ls everything okay?
- No. No.

44:39.844 --> 44:42.597
That was my neighbor. And, um...

44:42.680 --> 44:44.899
There was a robber,
or a burglar, I don't know.

44:44.974 --> 44:47.648
Anyway, they think
that the house was burgled!

44:47.727 --> 44:49.775
- Burgled?
- It's shocking!

44:50.521 --> 44:53.821
But you know something? I think
I need to get back there ASAP to help.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.618
What do you mean, help?

44:55.693 --> 44:58.071
What I mean is the authorities--
they may want to ask some questions.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.782
So I do need to get back there now.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.074
The authorities?

45:02.158 --> 45:04.411
I'm not a suspect. I'm not suspicious.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.666
It's not that kind of thing.
But I'm so worried.

45:06.746 --> 45:09.374
This world is just not
a safe place for you anymore.

45:09.457 --> 45:11.175
I'm sorry, and...

45:11.250 --> 45:14.094
I'm really gonna try
to keep that in my mind, okay?

45:14.337 --> 45:17.011
But anyway, I need to book
a flight back tomorrow.

45:17.089 --> 45:19.763
Do I just not turn you on anymore?

45:19.842 --> 45:23.187
I mean, I get it after 35 years
and three kids, but am I...

45:23.262 --> 45:26.106
Is it just not exciting anymore?

45:26.182 --> 45:27.434
I love you, Carol.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.814
I know you love me,
and I love you.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.688
Then what is the problem?

45:31.771 --> 45:34.820
The problem is we haven't
even tried to make love

45:34.899 --> 45:36.401
since your retirement party.

45:36.484 --> 45:38.327
And we both know
how that turned out.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.746
You yourself said
there was something wrong

45:40.821 --> 45:42.243
with the lamb that night.

45:42.490 --> 45:45.084
We both know there was
nothing wrong with the lamb.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.456
I'm the one who made it.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.629
I'm not having this conversation.

45:48.704 --> 45:52.049
Bruce, Vivian said
that it is so normal for men--

45:52.124 --> 45:53.671
Wait. Vivian?

45:53.751 --> 45:55.970
Dr. Schaefer said there are
safe and effective ways--

45:56.045 --> 45:57.513
You talked to Dr. Schaefer'?

45:57.588 --> 46:00.057
I did not think
you'd want to talk to him.

46:00.132 --> 46:03.056
- I don't want to talk to him!
- See? I knew that! I knew that!

46:03.135 --> 46:05.479
He asked me,
"Does he still pleasure himself?“

46:05.554 --> 46:07.807
- My God!
- And I said, “I have no idea!“

46:08.349 --> 46:10.818
Carol! This is enough!

46:10.893 --> 46:13.191
Bruce! I want to have sex!

46:15.273 --> 46:16.741
Hello.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.239
Excuse me.

46:24.573 --> 46:27.668
Okay, come on, baby.
Get your leg up there.

46:29.287 --> 46:30.584
Goddang it.

46:31.747 --> 46:32.794
Come on.

46:33.165 --> 46:35.714
What, you can't
get it turned on?

46:52.268 --> 46:54.362
Hi. Do you have a reservation?

46:54.437 --> 46:56.360
No, actually I'm meeting someone.

46:56.439 --> 46:58.157
His name is George.

46:58.232 --> 46:59.825
He's a tax accountant.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.075
Right. Follow me.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.658
Enjoy your meal.

47:07.742 --> 47:09.415
Hey, you have arms!

47:09.952 --> 47:11.875
It would've been fine
if you didn't, but it's...

47:11.954 --> 47:13.331
better that you do. Hey.

47:13.414 --> 47:16.964
So nice to... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll take care of it.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.421
This is why I don't leave the house.

47:22.048 --> 47:25.723
- Shall we start again?
- I'm afraid to reenter.

47:25.801 --> 47:27.178
Nah.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.855
We can take it right from here.

47:30.306 --> 47:31.432
Okay.

47:32.933 --> 47:34.480
So, what about you?

47:35.311 --> 47:37.734
- You work?
- Um, yes.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.532
Actually, I'm currently working
on my drinking.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.195
You have a nice laugh.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.494
Thank you.

47:48.032 --> 47:50.000
Actually, I'm a federal judge.

47:50.451 --> 47:51.748
Wow.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.505
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:55.539 --> 47:59.294
And I do have the power
to put you in handcuffs.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.596
I don't know
why I said that. Really.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.468
I'm sorry. I--

48:04.006 --> 48:06.850
I was guessing what you might be
thinking and...

48:06.926 --> 48:09.429
I mean, not you, but men.

48:09.512 --> 48:12.857
Not like all men
think the same, but...

48:13.682 --> 48:16.151
I'm sorry I'm not better at this,
but this is...

48:16.227 --> 48:17.353
Whoa.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.572
Can I make a confession?

48:20.022 --> 48:22.946
I changed
my shirt today six times

48:23.025 --> 48:24.698
and I only have five shirts.

48:25.653 --> 48:28.327
And the irony is
that they're all exactly alike.

48:28.656 --> 48:30.658
Blue, button-down, Brooks Brothers.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.869
Well, who doesn't love Brooks Brothers?

48:32.952 --> 48:34.499
Not this guy.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.123
When did dating get so complicated?

48:37.206 --> 48:39.880
I mean, it used to be
you'd go to a dance

48:39.959 --> 48:43.213
and bada-boom bada-bing,
you'd get married and pregnant.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.468
Now you have to come up with

48:45.548 --> 48:47.926
earth-shattering theories on life

48:48.008 --> 48:51.729
before you even get a "wink."
What is that, a "wink“ online?

48:51.804 --> 48:55.980
You know, you are so much better
at this than you think you are.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.440
Thank you.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.238
You are too, for the record.

49:02.064 --> 49:05.238
All my past relationships
taught me one thing.

49:06.694 --> 49:08.367
I can't sleep with men.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.325
Well, now, there's a revelation
I was not expecting.

49:11.407 --> 49:14.411
No, but sex is fine.
I just can't sleep.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.330
Okay, that makes more sense.

49:17.413 --> 49:20.007
Now I can focus on
what you're gonna say next.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.881
I can't understand
how men can sleep anywhere.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.054
On the floor, in a bed, on a couch.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.302
I'm staring at the ceiling
and they're off

49:27.381 --> 49:29.429
in some blissful dreamscape.

49:30.468 --> 49:34.564
Well, they say that bad sleep
is a sign of a bad relationship.

49:34.638 --> 49:36.982
Yeah, well, I can attest to that.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.227
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49:40.311 --> 49:41.608
Wow.

49:42.688 --> 49:44.986
I never thought
I'd be back here again.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.446
Me, neither.

49:47.443 --> 49:48.490
Here we go.

49:52.907 --> 49:56.502
- Is it as good <i>as</i> you remember?
- Maybe better.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.132
Let me ask you a question.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.131
What's your favorite thing
in the whole world?

50:06.378 --> 50:08.130
Well, that's a very broad question.

50:08.214 --> 50:09.340
Um...

50:11.175 --> 50:12.518
Arm tickles.

50:12.593 --> 50:15.016
- Come on.
- No, without a doubt.

50:15.638 --> 50:18.517
No, it's true.
I'm a girl of simple pleasures.

50:18.599 --> 50:21.443
Says the girl
with a staff of 150!

50:21.519 --> 50:23.237
But it would be so much better

50:23.312 --> 50:25.314
if they were all tickling my arms.

50:30.402 --> 50:33.451
You know what I love to do
that I never do anymore?

50:34.073 --> 50:38.874
Listen to a full album on vinyl
from beginning to end.

50:40.579 --> 50:43.458
Vinyl sure has made
a comeback, hasn't it?

50:43.832 --> 50:46.335
Well, some things
stand the test of time.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.006
That they do.

51:20.869 --> 51:22.997
Dance is about connection.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.375
It can't just be routine.

51:25.457 --> 51:28.256
Moving in unison
is not the same <i>as</i> dancing.

51:30.129 --> 51:31.176
Right.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.052
I think
we're done for the night.

51:37.177 --> 51:38.224
Sorry.

51:49.857 --> 51:53.612
I was 14. She was 17.
She could drive a car.

51:54.153 --> 51:57.032
And she was sitting behind the wheel.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.957
She said, “Come here.“

52:01.368 --> 52:02.915
This is me.

52:03.996 --> 52:05.748
Thank you for making tonight so easy.

52:05.831 --> 52:08.835
...It was a great, great pleasure.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.976
Um, I have to ask you this.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.928
First of all, I think you're great.

52:19.011 --> 52:22.060
And second,
I know that the chances of this

52:22.139 --> 52:25.439
going past this evening are slim, but...

52:26.310 --> 52:28.028
would you mind if I...

52:28.604 --> 52:29.947
kissed you?

52:30.022 --> 52:31.319
If I had a nickel

52:31.398 --> 52:33.366
for every time
someone asked me that.

52:33.442 --> 52:36.286
All right, all right. I'll just rewind
the tape about 3O seconds.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.114
Shut up and kiss me.

52:40.199 --> 52:41.451
Hell.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.594
I think this belongs to you.

53:05.099 --> 53:06.521
Thank you.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.695
Ginsburger!

53:24.118 --> 53:26.712
Ooh. I'm gonna need
a bigger back seat.

53:28.872 --> 53:32.502
Paging Dr. Derek.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.469
Is this good?

53:38.549 --> 53:40.392
This is fine, this is totally fine.

53:40.467 --> 53:41.889
Okay.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.853
I love how your generation
still feels the need

53:46.932 --> 53:48.525
to get fancy for air travel.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.943
It's so cute.

53:51.437 --> 53:52.689
Okay...

53:52.771 --> 53:55.024
- Call me when you get back to L.A.
- Of course.

53:55.107 --> 53:56.575
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.118
- Be safe.
- Bye-bye.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.911
- Love you.
- Love you!

54:13.625 --> 54:15.377
Quite an escape, Houdini.

54:16.336 --> 54:19.306
God. I can't believe I'm doing this.

54:48.494 --> 54:49.791
You know, I can't get over it.

54:49.870 --> 54:53.249
Honestly, I'm not sure
I've ever seen a prettier sky.

54:53.332 --> 54:55.755
Right?

54:55.834 --> 54:57.882
- Cheers.
- Cheers, okay.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.178
Boom.

54:59.505 --> 55:00.973
Can I show you something?

55:01.757 --> 55:03.509
- Sure.
- Come with me.

55:03.592 --> 55:04.593
What are we doing? Wait.

55:04.676 --> 55:06.849
- Are you nervous?
- ...Should I be?

55:08.180 --> 55:09.853
I'm not sure I've ever met anybody

55:09.932 --> 55:12.606
who owned their own barn before.

55:13.143 --> 55:15.111
You got to get out
of the city more often.

55:15.187 --> 55:18.191
No, wait, no.
Forget it.

55:18.273 --> 55:20.947
There is no chance in hell
I'm getting into that thing.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.278
No. No!

55:22.361 --> 55:24.409
You're gonna love it.
It's gonna be great.

55:24.488 --> 55:26.957
I'm sorry, but...
What are you talking about?

55:27.032 --> 55:28.454
No, I'm not getting in there.

55:28.534 --> 55:30.787
These are the controls.
Don't touch anything.

55:30.869 --> 55:32.212
If you touch it, we'll crash.

55:33.038 --> 55:34.915
- Don't say that.
- I'm kidding.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.966
This is my baby, okay?

55:37.042 --> 55:39.010
See that "B“ there? You see?

55:39.086 --> 55:42.716
- It's a Beechcraft Bonanza V-Tail.
- Okay.

55:42.798 --> 55:45.426
And it's been my passion project
for the last...

55:46.009 --> 55:47.181
20 years.

55:47.261 --> 55:49.434
Twenty years! Wait a minute.
How old is this thing?

55:49.513 --> 55:51.686
- It's a 1951.
- Whoa!

55:51.765 --> 55:53.984
I'm a 1951! Let me out of here!

55:54.059 --> 55:55.686
No, seriously.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.988
- Okay, we're going up.
- Wait, no.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.280
I'm gonna regret this!

56:06.405 --> 56:09.955
Please. No, no, you have
a death wish. Death wish!

56:10.033 --> 56:12.411
- Please.
- We're all gonna die someday, Diane.

56:12.786 --> 56:16.086
I just feel like it's worth living
a little bit while we still can.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.319
Overwhelming?

56:38.395 --> 56:39.772
Wanna hold on to the...

56:39.855 --> 56:42.324
- Okay.
- Just hold on to it.

56:42.399 --> 56:43.742
I'll hold on.

56:48.113 --> 56:49.535
- No!
- See that?

56:49.615 --> 56:50.662
Yes.

56:55.287 --> 56:57.255
No, that's...

57:01.501 --> 57:04.095
- I'm gonna bank, to the right.
- You're gonna bank?

57:09.092 --> 57:10.560
You know what that is?

57:10.636 --> 57:13.059
Yes. That's Cathedral Rock.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.606
That's right.

57:15.390 --> 57:17.939
My God.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.139
And all this, though,
from being a pilot

57:55.222 --> 57:57.975
-is what you're saying, right? This?
- No.

57:58.058 --> 57:59.935
- No?
- No, what happened was

58:00.018 --> 58:01.691
I got out of the Air Force,

58:01.770 --> 58:05.240
and I went to work for this
aeronautical research lab.

58:05.315 --> 58:08.569
And, you know, I came up
with this design that...

58:09.069 --> 58:11.492
that reduced engine drag in a jet.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.573
It's silly, but it's a big patent,

58:13.657 --> 58:16.456
and this is what happened
right here. See?

58:20.539 --> 58:22.633
You're gonna have
to introduce me to your family.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.005
When can I meet them?

58:24.084 --> 58:26.303
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?

58:26.378 --> 58:29.382
Because they're still very sensitive
about their father and...

58:30.632 --> 58:32.054
What about you?

58:34.928 --> 58:37.181
Well, I'm... I mean, I loved him.

58:38.890 --> 58:42.110
But I guess I realized
I was in mourning

58:42.185 --> 58:43.983
for the end of something.

58:44.062 --> 58:45.484
It's been a long time.

58:45.939 --> 58:48.738
I mean, I guess, I don't know,
the world sees your...

58:49.484 --> 58:50.952
your relationship in one way,

58:51.028 --> 58:53.326
you just kind of go along, but...

58:53.405 --> 58:55.157
then the truth is...

58:56.658 --> 58:58.786
it had been over between us
for a long time.

58:59.828 --> 59:00.954
So...

59:01.705 --> 59:03.173
what do you think of that?

59:04.458 --> 59:06.301
You don't want to hear
my sad story, do you?

59:06.376 --> 59:08.003
Maybe you should tell me yours.

59:08.086 --> 59:09.554
I don't have a sad story.

59:09.629 --> 59:12.132
You don't have a sad story
'cause you're rich.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.513
It's been 24 hours
and there's still no answer.

59:14.593 --> 59:16.015
Okay, I'm sure she's fine.

59:16.094 --> 59:17.516
You're so sure everything is fine!

59:17.596 --> 59:19.348
She could be passed out
in a ditch somewhere!

59:19.431 --> 59:21.854
Adrianne, please calm down.

59:21.933 --> 59:24.561
- I'm calling Jill.
- You're being hormonal!

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.108
Sharon, is that you?

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.778
Tom? Hi.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.355
Wow! Hi!

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.781
Hi...

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.242
- Unexpected.
- Yeah.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.240
Your hair's... dark.

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:19.324
It's dyed.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.956
- I know.
- Right, right.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.537
I want to introduce you to someone.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.963
Actually, I have to--

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.585
Babe! Come here.

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:29.801
Babe, babe,
I want you to meet Sharon.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.924
Sharon, this is my fiancée, Cheryl.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:34.552
It is so nice to meet you!

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.258
I've heard so much about you.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.843
Sharon?

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.519
Excuse me, are you Sharon?

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.517
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:44.770
I was in a complicated sinus surgery.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.648
Don't ask.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.603
Hi, I'm Dr. Derek.

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.189
You can just call me Derek.

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:51.398
Hi, I'm Tom.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.950
- Kill me now.
- I'm sorry, who are you?

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:57.529
Dr. Derek. Derek. Sharon's date.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:01:00.491
- Wow.
- Hi. I am Cheryl.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:03.581
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
That's great.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.664
You look so amazing
without your mask!

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.175
How sweet.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.128
You should bring Dr. Derek
to the party next week.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.213
- What?
- The double-engagement party.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:16.344
Didn't Jared tell you?

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:17.765
Cheryl and I got engaged.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.219
We've having a little celebration
with our friends.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:22.430
But it really is for Jared and Kate.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.765
- We would so love to have you.
- Yes.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.976
- And you, too, Doctor.
- Yeah.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:29.527
Well, that sounds so nice!

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:32.857
Say, do you need a DJ?
I do that on the side.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.407
- Ooh!
“Ooh!

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:36.701
Do you do the vinyl
or what do you do, CDs?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.633
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.684
You sure you're okay in the bar?

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.263
Yeah. It's gonna be like
the good old days.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:07.357
Cheers.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.166
Ha! Am I ever.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.591
Inner goddess doing
the merengue, my <i>ass!</i>

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.759
So is this where you take all the boys?

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.020
Only the ones I don't want
to be seen with at the bar.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.978
Well, I'll choose
to take that as a compliment.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.652
Restricted area?

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:54.525
Owner's perks.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.576
Look at this.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.700
A single solitary chair.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.201
It's all a girl needs.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.784
It's like a queen's throne
atop her castle.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.582
Look. Look at the view.

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:13.374
Yeah. Look at
all those twinkling lights.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.754
All those lives being lived.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.721
As the poem goes,
you took the road less traveled,

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.676
and it made... all the difference.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:27.020
You know, that's not really
what that poem is about.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.727
- Is that right?
- No.

01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:31.687
It's, um...

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:36.405
It's about how we--
we tell the story of our lives,

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:40.567
so we feel heroic, brave...

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.695
but in fact, there's no difference

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:45.576
in the paths to begin with.

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:48.913
- No difference in the paths?
- Nope.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:53.629
Fascinating poem.

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:02.468
Arthur, come here.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.594
Look at this. You see that
building with the red lights?

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:09.479
- Is that our diner?
- Yeah.

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:14.067
I can't believe your hotel
overlooks our favorite place.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.527
According to the airline,
your mother never boarded her flight.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.863
- My God.
- You said not to worry about it!

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:27.993
- Okay, you can worry now.
- What?

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:29.245
However...

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:31.455
we did trace a signal
to her cell phone.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.002
- What?
- Okay.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.080
- What does that mean?
- We know where she is.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.131
- She's been kidnapped?
- I did not say that.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.675
- Is there a ransom?
- You know where she is?

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.548
In a case like this,
it's best to remain calm.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.220
- Let's get a grip, folks.
- You know where she is?

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.218
If you had to guess,
what would you say?

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.015
I don't have to guess,
I actually know.

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:47.513
- Well, then take us there!
- Can I see the pad?

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:50.391
I can't believe
you put Viagra in my beer.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.438
Well, it was an innocent mistake.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.892
Innocent. How is it innocent?
You poisoned me.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.191
Hardly.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.520
Do not use that word.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.482
- I'm sorry. How does it feel?
- Hard!

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.441
I thought we weren't
gonna use that word.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:05.152
I can, you can't.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.237
- God, there are so many rules.
- Don't, Carol!

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.948
Jeez.

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.159
I'll tell you something,
I don't think it ought to go to waste.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.620
- Seriously! Stop it.
- Calm down.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:19.003
Really? I'm being pulled over.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.214
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.341
I don't think that's
a good idea, Officer.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:27.174
Out of the car now!

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:28.634
Okay, okay.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.931
Gosh darn it.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.472
Man.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:39.561
Look, I'm sorry.
My wife put Viagra in my drink.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.567
It's actually true.
It's my bad, I'm so sorry.

01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:44.274
But you see, it's just he's been
having a little trouble

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:47.281
in that department,
and he was embarrassed.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.579
And if there's one thing
I know about this man,

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.577
it's that he really hates
to be embarrassed.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:52.748
Isn't that true, Pup?

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.246
I hate a lot of things right now.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.123
That's not even in the top three.

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:58.455
Will this affect your ability to drive?

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.340
No, ma'am.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:02.584
Okay.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.628
- Er1j0y your night.
- Okay.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.842
You, too.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.514
Thank you.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:17.265
I think I like you.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:20.602
Well, I think that's probably
just the wine talking, right?

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.319
Wait.

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:26.449
You know what?
I think I'm in trouble here.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:29.031
- I'm well past trouble.
- Yeah?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.953
What?

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.531
I think I heard something.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.161
It's probably just
the wine talking, right?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.953
And how often does the wine
talk in your world?

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.085
My God. Wait, who-- who is that?

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.668
- Mom?
- Boy.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.342
- My God.
- My God.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.219
My God!

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:52.426
My God! Mom!

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.728
Honey, let me explain.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:56.725
What the heck is happening here?

01:06:56.804 --> 01:07:00.980
Hi. You must be, 
Adrianne and Jill.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.356
I'm Mitchell.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.482
- Chris.
- Stop it!

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.188
Mitchell, can you just...

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:07.444
You Okay?

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:10.903
- Mom!
- No, please. No, I'm fine.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.408
Just let me explain, okay?
I'll be right back.

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:15.035
Wait, where are you going?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:21.330
She's okay. She's perfectly...
She was in good hands. Relax.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.289
- You relax!
- No, it's okay.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.421
- You relax!
- We've had a long day. I'm sorry.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.844
I was just trying to give us
a little jumpstart.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.013
I thought maybe if we had
a really nice night

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.840
and things sort of
naturally progressed,

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.346
then maybe
we would both feel better.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.803
Great plan! Congratulations
on the execution.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:40.356
Sorry. I really was just
trying to help you, Bruce.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.559
Help me?
By never once considering

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.770
that I might have an opinion!

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.864
No, it's not just tonight.
It's everything, Carol!

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:49.907
<i>You've got me taking</i> dance <i>lessons.</i>

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:54.363
Dance lessons for a talent show
that I never even signed up for!

01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:57.119
You've been going to my
No Kid Hungry fundraiser

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.745
for the past 15 years.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.327
You always show up for me.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.162
That was for dinner.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.997
Well, forgive me for trying to find ways

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.297
to keep us connected.

01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:07.341
"Hey, Bruce, here's something
you're gonna hate to do

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.796
for the next two months,
but in the end it'll be okay

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:14.428
because there will be
an onstage public shaming!

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.600
So happy anniversary!"

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.636
What, what? Sorry, sorry.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.519
Didn't hear you at all,
because my husband

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.770
gave me these wonderful earplugs,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.273
so we wouldn't have to listen
to each other anymore.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.104
Happy anniversary!

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.573
Hey, and by the way,

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.274
I got us the earplugs
so you wouldn't miss

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:33.734
any of your TV shows,

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.787
just because I happen
to love to fall asleep

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.615
next to my wife in our bed!

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.538
So forgive me!

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.474
Okay, what are you doing?
Come on.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.301
Diane, I know this--

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.511
I know this is not the direction
we hoped for this evening.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:05.020
This is... It's such a disaster!
Do you see what I mean?

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:07.773
You've got to admit it was kind of funny.
A cop showed up!

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.354
No, it wasn't kind of funny.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:12.064
This whole thing
is just one giant mistake.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.444
You don't believe that.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:15.367
I get that it's embarrassing,
but who gives a shit?

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.286
No, you know what?
You don't get it, Mitchell.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.285
You know why?
Because you don't have kids.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.792
Kids? They're like adults, your kids.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:24.995
You know,

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:26.751
you're out here on your ranch,

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.627
with no one to take care of but yourself.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:31.630
Okay, that's fine for you,
but that's not the real world.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.678
I have a family
and I have responsibilities.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.974
- I'm sorry, but that's my world.
- I'm sure I don't understand

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.642
everything you're
going through right now.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.640
That's right. You don't have a clue.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:45.439
Listen to me. Look at me.
I know we just met.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.064
But you can't spend your entire life
just going around

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:49.769
taking care of other people.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.819
That's also not part of the real world.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.318
Okay, hey!

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:55.241
- Diane.
- What? What?

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:57.193
I'm saying it's okay
to be happy, Diane.

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:00.492
Well, I'm really...
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:26.286
Bruce. Bruce, honey.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:27.909
What?

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:32.084
I know I've been acting
a little crazy lately.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:35.212
And obviously
I went overboard tonight.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.634
Really?

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.382
My gosh, I hadn't noticed.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.798
I am so sorry.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.010
I embarrassed you...

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.981
and I made you feel
like you didn't matter.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.399
I just don't know
what's been going on with you

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.445
for the last few months
and it scares me.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.481
I know what I did was wrong, and...

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.151
I'm sorry.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.414
I got spooked.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.241
Spooked?

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.452
Yeah, at the...

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.667
retirement party.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:14.998
You know, I saw...

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.842
40 years just... vanish.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:22.718
And I didn't know
who I was anymore.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.675
Well, what was I gonna do?

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.518
What can I do?

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:29.395
I got scared.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.023
I am scared.

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:37.153
And I need a little time
to figure out who I am again.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:38.984
I hear you.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:42.738
And I'm not gonna try
to fix everything on my own...

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:46.283
tempting though that may be.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.036
And I'm not gonna make you do
a bunch of stuff

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:51.789
that you don't want to do,
like dancing at the fundraiser.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.996
I know you never wanted to do that.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.830
So forget it, okay?

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.625
I'm going to bed.

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:09.351
<i>Whoa, ice cream
straight from the tub?</i>

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:13.273
Yeah, well, I ran into Tom
and his very happy fiancée.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.605
They're hosting
a double-engagement party

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:18.152
at their house.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.730
Did I mention he calls her "babe"?

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.032
Which is sort of perfect
since she's a child.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:24.233
- No.
- Yeah.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.489
What did I miss?

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.196
Well, Sharon is never dating again.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:29.872
And we're all miserable.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:31.415
So basically nothing has changed.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.037
Yeah, well...

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:37.042
Whoa. Since when
do you eat ice cream?

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.714
Since now.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.008
So I take it things
went south for you, too?

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:43.010
I slept with Arthur.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.883
Now, there's a shocker.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.555
No, not sex.

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:49.972
I actually fell asleep with him.

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.850
You've never been able
to sleep with a man before!

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.306
I know.

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:57.016
So, I mean...
you didn't have sex?

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.522
We slept on a couch
and he tickled my arm.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:03.323
Boy, now this is a disaster.
When is he leaving?

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.946
Not soon enough!
God, I got a brain freeze.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.743
Here, give that to a professional.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.286
My God!

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.660
Well, anyway,
I have an announcement.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:13.574
Okay.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:14.784
I am...

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:17.711
I'm officially... moving to Arizona.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.415
- What?
- Tell me it's for the pilot!

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:23.217
No, no, no.
For my daughters.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.883
This has gone from bad to worse!

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:29.262
Well, I mean, they renovated
the basement for me,

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.013
and everything is slip resistant,

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:33.311
and I can walk into the tub.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:34.933
- My God.
- lck.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.639
But what about the pilot?

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.566
Crashed and burned.
I mean, we're not 18 anymore.

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.110
Nope.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.108
We're sure not spring flowers.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:45.690
No. More like potpourri.

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:47.491
So, this is...

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:49.739
My God,
this is my last book club!

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.571
No, you're kidding!

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.871
Diane!

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.120
Do we even want to talk
about the book?

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.040
- I hate this book, okay? Done.
- Me, too.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.212
Yeah.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:01.709
Are we really this pathetic?

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.417
None of us have
anything interesting to say?

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.550
Well, my little affair
ended with me in a pool

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.848
on top of an inflatable swan

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:13.142
and my daughters showing up
with the police!

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:16.562
Well, that certainly
qualifies as interesting.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.770
I'm assuming
you were not in that pool alone.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.442
Well... I was not.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.481
Good for you.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.402
Do I want to get us
another one of these?

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.278
- Yeah.
- Yes!

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.859
The sooner the better.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.805
Men make life impossible.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.557
God, tell me about it.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.353
Well, you're one to talk.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:02.024
Ditching God's gift to women
so you can live in a basement

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.898
and breastfeed
your daughter's children?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:07.730
You know something?
That's really rich coming from you.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.362
You've been stuck on Torn
for 18 years,

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.318
and you don't even like the guy.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.823
He's not at your level.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.782
Eighteen years ago,
you couldn't wait to get rid of him.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:20.494
But you've conveniently erased
that little piece of history.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.872
Wish I could erase
a little piece of my history.

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:26.753
- Well...
- What?

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:28.834
I was fine until Arthur came along.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.465
I had a happy existence.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.012
Had a roster of men

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.261
that would satisfy my every whim.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.890
My God,
I can't listen to this anymore.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:40.972
You really believe you're satisfied?
How could you be?

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.898
You're so terrified of getting hurt

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:46.193
that you do everything you can
to push away love.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:52.150
I'm gonna go back
to having sex and not caring.

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.031
Because that's what
works for me, okay?

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.363
Stop lying to yourself, Vivian.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.789
Not everything in the world
is about sex.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.662
Did you even read the book?

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.748
This is a love story.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.797
That is what the world wants.
That's what the world needs.

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:09.000
So, okay, you can have sex
with anybody.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.801
Well, whoop-de-fricking-do.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:12.878
But you know what?
Eventually, people need

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.805
a little bit more than that.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:19.556
Everybody's got baggage
and pain and problems, but...

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.893
even Christian Grey fell in love.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.192
Yeah, and he was
fifty shades of fucked-up.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.484
So...

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.813
here you go.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:33.525
Book three? I am not sure
we'll survive another one.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.701
...God.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.577
God, I...

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:44.619
I really am gonna miss this. Right?

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.625
Honey.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:59.467
- Have a good drive.
- Thanks again.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.310
Ginsburg.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.737
What's happening here?

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:16.033
Honey?
What's happening?

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:34.590
Look at you.
Look at you.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.887
Yeah, yeah. Look at you.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:04.415
You're not taking my calls.

01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:07.043
I don't have my phone with me.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.169
Do you know why
I first started on radio?

01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:18.094
No, I don't.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.093
Because I loved the idea

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.392
of no matter what I said
or what music I played...

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.103
millions of people could just

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.055
turn on their radios and hear it.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.894
But then <i>as</i> I got older...

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:36.151
I realized that...

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.199
reaching millions and millions

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.902
of anonymous people...

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:43.696
doesn't come close...

01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:47.166
to reaching
just one person you love.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:54.331
And I'm... I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.461
And it got me thinking...

01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:02.256
wouldn't it be nice if...

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:04.558
you were coming with me
to New York?

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:08.767
But then I thought about it
and I thought about you...

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:12.437
and your hotel and your rooftop...

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:17.066
and your inability
to make proper wishes.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:22.368
I have no interest
in trying to change you, Vivian.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.163
I love who you are.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:29.287
Rich and independent...

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:31.960
and a total pain in the <i>ass.</i>

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:35.790
That does sound like... like me.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.718
And here we are,
staring at two paths.

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:43.631
And I know how I feel.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.851
I know that you're the person
that I want to talk to.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.684
You're the person I want to listen to.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:56.482
You're the person I want
to splash in the fountain.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.440
You're my person, Slim.

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:11.788
And I just wanted to know
what you thought about that.

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:21.927
It's-- It's been really nice
seeing you again, Arthur.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.972
I hope you have a safe trip home.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:47.320
- Hi.
-|-u.

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:02.252
Hi, everybody. I'd like to take
a second to say a few words.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:05.338
As most of you know,
I'm Tom Meyers, Jared's dad.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.423
On behalf of my fiancée,
Cheryl, and myself,

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.883
I want to thank you all for coming.

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:10.809
Kate, we're so excited t0 welcome you

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.477
and invite you into the family.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:16.349
- Jared, we are so very happy for you.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:20.062
As Shakespeare said, "Love looks
not with the eyes but with the mind."

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.025
How right he was.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.822
Love takes thought and care,

01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:26.776
and I'm glad that
all the plus columns lined up.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:30.449
Kate, you're getting
one of the good ones.

01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:32.452
Aww...

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:36.289
Sorry, I said I wouldn't do this.
To Jared and Kate.

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:40.585
Cheers!

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:49.931
I didn't mean to do that, sorry.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.680
Um, as-- as few...

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.724
Well, if any of you know,

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.306
I'm Jared's mother, Judge Meyers.

01:22:58.182 --> 01:22:59.308
Or Sharon.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:01.731
I just wanted to say,

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.359
I don't think that's what
Shakespeare had in mind

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:05.985
when he wrote those lines.

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.035
He was saying Cupid is blind.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.822
He wasn't saying
that people should go

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.704
think themselves into love

01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:18.251
and a system of pluses or minuses.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.079
But whatever.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.132
Anyway, when I look at my son...

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:26.502
I am so proud of him because...

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:30.306
he has had the courage
to put himself out there,

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:33.266
and he's found someone
to make him happy.

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:36.345
That's inspiring.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.644
Even for someone as old as me.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.568
The truth is...

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:47.690
love is not blind,
and it's not a battlefield,

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:51.323
and it's not the sun or the moon
or everything we load onto it.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:56.123
It's just a word
until someone gives it meaning.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.494
And that's what the two of you
have found in each other.

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:02.830
In fact, all four of you.

01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:05.007
And we all deserve that.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.591
Well done.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:08.585
Cheers!

01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:10.216
Kate and Jared.

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:23.316
Hello?

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:25.144
<i>Miss O'Donnell,
I'm calling</i> to <i>confirm</i>

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.321
<i>that Mr. Riley
has officially checked out.</i>

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.981
Thank you.

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.579
Hi, sweetie.

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.205
Hey.

01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:44.164
What happened? We've been
trying to call all afternoon.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:46.415
What, you're still in a robe?

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:48.751
Carol's show starts in an hour.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:51.215
I saw Arthur last night.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.421
Fun.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:55.974
No! I broke up with him
once and for all.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.644
- I did.
- What happened?

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.596
He told me he wanted to invite me

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:01.976
to move to New York with him,

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.103
but he realized
he didn't want to change me

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:06.355
because he loves me the way I am.

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:08.111
And he only wants to talk to me,

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.688
and he only wants to listen to me.

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:12.695
He told me I was his person.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.323
I'm sorry. I mean,

01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:17.575
I'm not actually following here.

01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:19.076
No, me, neither.

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:21.909
You said that he loves you...
<i>as</i> you are?

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:23.494
He doesn't want to change you?

01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:25.124
And he wanted to know your thoughts?

01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:28.582
- So you broke up with him?
- Well, yeah, exactly! Duh.

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.042
Are you out of your mind?

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.678
Okay, where is he?

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:36.883
He checked out
and he's on his way to New York.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:40.139
Okay. Okay.
Time to get dressed.

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:42.391
Yup. That's it, Viv,
you're going after him.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:45.270
- Get up, get up.
- No! My God.

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.726
What time is his flight?

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.027
Never mind, I'll figure it out.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:51.025
She has to put on something sexy.

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:52.947
Everything she owns is sexy!

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:55.776
I can't... God! It is so yucky,

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:57.236
and this is so needy!

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.242
Sharon, I am not desperate.

01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:01.119
No, you are not. You are stupid.

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:04.418
No, I am not.
You just-- You don't understand.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:08.168
I know how this story ends,
and I do not like it.

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:10.544
If he has me, he's gonna get bored.

01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:13.002
He hasn't seen me naked in 4O years!

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:14.678
I know. I'm sorry. My God...

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:17.632
I'm no fool! I know what happens.

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:19.307
He's gonna cheat on me

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:20.509
and leave me for a younger woman.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.094
And then I'm gonna lose everything.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.145
And it's just-- it's not worth it!

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.349
- Okay, baby, there you go.
- It isn't worth it.

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.768
I'm so sorry. I'm very sorry.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.649
But it had to be done, all right?

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:38.194
- It's okay.
- His flight leaves in an hour.

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:40.028
- God, are you sure?
- Yes.

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:41.989
Okay, earrings! Time to go.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.120
- Do I look okay?
- Yes, you look great.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:45.371
The girls.

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:47.703
- You want me to put those on?
- Yep. Go.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.959
G -Okay!
<i>'</i> °' 9°, 90. go!

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:54.126
I put a lipstick and compact in there.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.211
That's so great!
Thanks.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:59.264
- My God, do I look okay?
- Yes! Yes.

01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:02.597
- Here we go.
- Bye!

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.144
- Bye.
- Bye_

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.433
My shoes.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.693
And Carol, your show!

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:13.395
God, don't be ridiculous.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:16.231
And Diane... you're leaving!

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:19.659
My God, you're leaving.
What am I gonna do?

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.320
Shoes!

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:23.701
God, thank you, guys.
I love you so much.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:31.251
To the airport, Mario!

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:41.173
Okay, that's scary.

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.437
You're gonna do great!
Gonna do great.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:05.372
And that was Jed and Leyla
Sanderson performing!

01:28:05.822 --> 01:28:08.450
Hard to believe
she's an anesthesiologist.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.999
Arthur, it's Vivian. Call me back

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.454
before you board your plane.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.545
Mario, are you using Waze?

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:18.339
Yes, Miss O'Donnell,
but I don't think we're gonna make it.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:26.097
And last but not least,

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:30.682
everyone's favorite chef
and our fearless organizer.

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:35.523
Dancing a solo will be...
Carol Colby!

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.534
Wait. No, no, wait. Sorry.

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:44.320
That's not the right song.

01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:46.279
It's supposed to be
"Red, Red Robin Goes Bob, Bob--"

01:28:46.863 --> 01:28:49.366
Shoot. Meat Loaf? Come on!

01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:50.541
Aw, screw it.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:58.208
My God, she's tap dancing
to Meat Loaf!

01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.918
And she's pulling it off!

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:42.419
Bruce!

01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:57.066
Five, six, seven, eight...

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.669
My God.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.971
My, my!
How about those Colbys?

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:33.979
A romantic way to end the show.

01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:40.106
God, I can't believe you're here.

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:43.234
I couldn't miss a chance
to dance with my girl.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:45.523
- You were incredible.
- No, I wasn't.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:47.701
None of our steps
go with Meat Loaf.

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:51.117
Who needs the steps?
We were dancing.

01:30:57.869 --> 01:30:59.997
I'm sorry. Your cell phone
is poking me.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.003
No, I didn't bring my cell phone.

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:05.460
You want to go home now? What do you say?

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:07.045
- I say yes.
- Okay.

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:22.485
Arthur!

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.068
I thought you left.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.032
I did.

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:33.367
I went to the airport to try t0 see you.

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:38.452
Why are you here?

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.539
I realized I...

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.754
forgot to give you back your penny.

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:48.629
Why did you go to the airport?

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.803
I realized I wanted my penny back.

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:57.562
See, I tried to live without it
for-- for the past 4O years.

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:00.185
And I didn't like it.

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:09.653
Do you want to make a wish?

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:12.403
I do.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:19.118
My God, you probably killed someone.

01:32:21.327 --> 01:32:22.954
There's a subroof.

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:43.892
Nancy in my office,
she's in a book club,

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:45.568
and I thought
you might like to meet her.

01:32:45.643 --> 01:32:47.896
Well, that's... that's very sweet.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:50.107
Anyone else want
another piece of pizza?

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.157
I have one.

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:53.155
- Mom.
- What?

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.281
You're not hungry?

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.829
I guess not.

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:59.158
Well, I mean,
you're probably exhausted.

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:03.291
It's really not okay
that you drove here all by yourself.

01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:05.292
At your age, Mom,
you could have killed somebody.

01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:06.497
I really don't think so.

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.709
And the fact that you
don't even realize that

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:09.918
is what is so scary.

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:11.173
Jesus! Will you just...

01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:15.715
Please stop, okay?

01:33:16.883 --> 01:33:18.135
I mean, really!

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.553
My God.

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:22.563
Okay.

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:28.653
You know how proud I am
of both of you.

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.778
The greatest gift I think
a parent can give a child

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.157
is to lead by example,

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.410
and I don't think
I did a very good job.

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:40.706
But your father...

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:43.251
My goodness,
he was stable, wasn't he?

01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:45.294
And smart and kind.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:47.043
He was just a great dad.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:50.334
Fine husband.
And we had a nice life.

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:56.344
But there's something...
I really have to say.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:04.022
There's a man out there
who makes me feel things

01:34:04.097 --> 01:34:05.940
that I didn't think were...

01:34:06.516 --> 01:34:07.984
still possible.

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:10.312
You know what he does?
He makes me feel

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:13.023
curious and excited about the world.

01:34:13.106 --> 01:34:16.360
And maybe things with us will go bust.

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:20.037
Maybe my feelings will be hurt,
but that's life.

01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:23.870
And in spite of what
you both seem to think...

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:27.037
I'm not through living mine just yet.

01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:29.380
I have things that I want to explore.

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:31.753
And guess what?
I think I've earned that right.

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:36.634
So it's time for all of this
to just stop, okay?

01:34:37.922 --> 01:34:43.349
You both seem to have
very, very strong parenting instincts.

01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:45.476
But do save it for your children

01:34:45.555 --> 01:34:48.559
because your mother is doing just fine.

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:51.819
And...

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.147
I know I'm getting older.

01:34:54.814 --> 01:34:57.317
But I'm still learning.

01:34:57.817 --> 01:34:59.945
And one of the biggest
lessons I've learned

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:02.907
is not to be afraid to be happy.

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:06.584
I love you both.

01:35:07.493 --> 01:35:09.541
But I'm not staying here anymore.

01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:12.544
Mom...

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:17.595
Morn! Mom!

01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:21.515
Have fun.

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:27.855
Love you.

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.524
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you.

01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:39.192
- Drive safe!
- Bye!

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.449
Can I come in?

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:28.749
No way.

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:30.418
- No way?
- No way.

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:38.218
- What's in the U-Haul?
- Just my overnight bag.

01:36:52.598 --> 01:36:57.274
My inner goddess says,
"Most definitely yes."

01:37:27.091 --> 01:37:29.514
Yeah, yeah, I see the arms.
