01:58.198 --> 01:59.426
Colonel.

02:01.768 --> 02:04.737
The Führer's emissary
has arrived from Berchtesgaden.

02:05.338 --> 02:07.431
Have him wait in the lobby.

02:07.607 --> 02:11.703
Perhaps, sir, it would be more politic
if you extended an immediate welcome.

02:11.812 --> 02:15.543
You will never become a General's aide
thinking like that, Horst.

02:15.882 --> 02:19.079
But, sir, this is the Führer's
representative.

02:19.252 --> 02:23.348
No. He is only my opportunity
to catch the Führer's eye.

02:23.924 --> 02:25.858
And when this project is finished...

02:25.926 --> 02:29.555
the Führer will recognize
that I deserve the credit.

02:29.763 --> 02:32.323
Not some Berchtesgaden errand boy.

02:36.703 --> 02:37.931
Colonel!

02:41.675 --> 02:43.336
Col. Kesselmann.

02:45.278 --> 02:47.041
I am Fausta Grables.

02:50.116 --> 02:52.812
There's no need
to identify yourself, Fräulein.

02:53.086 --> 02:57.580
I still have a sore throat from cheering
your many victories in the 1936 Olympics.

02:57.757 --> 02:59.782
May I say how much I admire you?

02:59.860 --> 03:02.590
Let us not waste the time. May we begin?

03:09.369 --> 03:13.897
We are very busy men, Fräulein.
We have little time for watching films.

03:14.174 --> 03:16.267
The Führer is busier...

03:16.676 --> 03:19.338
and he watched this film for six hours.

03:21.248 --> 03:23.045
Please turn off the lights.

03:35.795 --> 03:37.888
This, gentlemen, is Wonder Woman.

03:38.765 --> 03:41.495
Her strength and agility...

03:42.102 --> 03:44.070
seem quite unusual.

03:44.905 --> 03:48.272
And those bracelets
appear to have a magical power.

03:50.110 --> 03:51.509
She is very clever.

03:52.913 --> 03:55.177
Now stop the film and turn on the light.

03:58.285 --> 04:01.345
This is nonsense.
Obviously trick photography.

04:01.521 --> 04:04.285
Hollywood magic
for American propaganda.

04:04.391 --> 04:05.722
No, mein Colonel.

04:06.660 --> 04:10.255
The entire espionage apparatus
in Washington confirms...

04:10.964 --> 04:15.196
that this woman is truly capable
of every action you saw.

04:15.435 --> 04:17.334
Just how strong is she?

04:17.771 --> 04:20.740
This is what the Führer
wants us to find out.

04:23.577 --> 04:25.408
Operation Fräulein.

04:25.879 --> 04:29.007
It will be my pleasure
to capture Wonder Woman...

04:29.282 --> 04:32.649
and bring her back to Germany
for you to study...

04:32.719 --> 04:35.745
and find out if she has
any unusual secrets.

04:36.423 --> 04:39.187
We will make her power ours.

04:39.693 --> 04:41.524
I have already a plan.

04:41.595 --> 04:44.120
You just get me safely...

04:44.197 --> 04:47.724
into and out of the United States.

04:49.369 --> 04:51.166
Please turn off the lights.

04:59.312 --> 05:02.475
This is American war hero...

05:02.549 --> 05:05.313
Air Corps Maj. Steve Trevor.

05:05.719 --> 05:09.883
The last three times Wonder Woman
was seen, she was aiding this man.

05:10.757 --> 05:14.386
I will use him... to bait my trap.

05:14.461 --> 05:17.988
- May I suggest-
- Colonel, my plane is waiting.

05:18.765 --> 05:21.700
Please have everything ready
when I return with Wonder Woman.

05:21.768 --> 05:22.757
Hail, Hitler!

05:30.176 --> 05:32.007
If you return...

05:32.345 --> 05:34.336
Nazi Wonder Woman.

05:54.234 --> 05:55.861
Working late again, Major?

05:55.935 --> 05:58.426
You know the War Department
and all the paperwork.

05:58.505 --> 06:01.804
- I’d be happy to stay and help you-
- No need for that.

06:01.875 --> 06:05.436
You've put in more than
a full 12 hours already. You need your rest.

06:05.512 --> 06:07.139
- Good night then.
- Good night.

06:07.213 --> 06:08.578
- Oh, Diana.
- Yes?

06:09.149 --> 06:11.777
I’m grateful for your good, hard work.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.628
Is it all right if I clean up in here now?

07:02.702 --> 07:05.398
If you could come back in a few hours,
I’d appreciate it.

07:05.472 --> 07:08.464
Sure. While I’m here,
I’ll just empty your wastebasket.

07:08.541 --> 07:11.374
No. Don't bother.
Some of those papers are top secret...

07:11.444 --> 07:14.936
and I personally carry
all my wastepaper to the incinerator.

07:20.386 --> 07:21.978
What's going on?

07:45.111 --> 07:47.978
- Mission accomplished.
- Excellent.

07:50.183 --> 07:53.380
- Is everything ready at the warehouse?
- Just as you asked.

07:53.453 --> 07:57.787
Good. Now we have the bait
to capture Wonder Woman.

07:58.725 --> 08:00.920
I checked with
Gen. Blankenship, Diana.

08:00.994 --> 08:03.428
He hasn't seen Steve today, either.

08:03.530 --> 08:06.021
No, thank you. I can't understand it, Etta.

08:06.132 --> 08:09.590
It’s not like Steve
to leave top-secret papers on his desk.

08:09.736 --> 08:13.900
I also checked with his Officers' Quarters
and they didn't see him come in last night.

08:13.973 --> 08:16.942
That Steve!
Where does he get all his energy?

08:17.544 --> 08:19.409
No, I left him here at work.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.651
Maj. Trevor's office.
Yeoman First Class Prince speaking.

08:26.719 --> 08:27.947
May I help you?

08:28.021 --> 08:29.852
My name is Eloise Livingston.

08:29.923 --> 08:32.982
I work the night shift
at the South River Defense Plant.

08:33.058 --> 08:35.789
And on my way home just now,
I found this note.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.227
It said for me call this number.

08:38.464 --> 08:40.227
A note? What did it say?

08:40.466 --> 08:42.491
"Whoever finds this note...

08:43.602 --> 08:45.298
"please call my office...

08:46.005 --> 08:48.371
"and tell them to contact Wonder Woman.

08:49.642 --> 08:51.075
"I’m a prisoner...

08:51.411 --> 08:53.174
"and my life is in danger. "

08:53.246 --> 08:56.477
It is signed '"Maj. Steve Trevor. '"

08:58.051 --> 09:00.212
Would you hold on a moment, please?

09:01.187 --> 09:03.087
This is just routine business.

09:03.156 --> 09:06.717
Why don't you take these documents
and put them back in the safe?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.987
Good idea, Diana.

09:14.400 --> 09:18.097
Tell me. Did the note say anything else,
like where the Major was being held?

09:18.171 --> 09:19.638
No, I’m afraid not.

09:19.706 --> 09:21.537
Where did you find the note?

09:21.841 --> 09:24.275
On the sidewalk in front of a warehouse...

09:24.344 --> 09:28.337
at 49th Street Southwest
and Potomac Place.

09:28.815 --> 09:32.307
On behalf of the War Department,
I’d like to thank you, Miss Livingston.

09:32.385 --> 09:34.182
I just hope it's not too late.

09:49.702 --> 09:51.294
Etta? Diana.

09:51.971 --> 09:55.930
I just remembered I have an appointment
at the Red Cross to donate blood.

09:56.409 --> 09:57.398
Right.

09:57.477 --> 10:00.469
So if Steve comes back before I do,
would you tell him?

10:00.546 --> 10:02.104
Of course, Diana.

10:02.448 --> 10:05.474
- Would you cover my phone for me?
- You can count on me.

10:05.618 --> 10:07.085
Thank you. Bye-bye.

11:06.012 --> 11:09.209
Steve? Are you here?

11:20.159 --> 11:22.957
I’m afraid that's as far as you go.

11:23.196 --> 11:24.629
Where is Maj. Trevor?

11:24.697 --> 11:26.426
Who's Maj. Trevor?

11:26.766 --> 11:29.860
I have reason to believe
that you're holding him prisoner.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.096
Where is he?

11:34.207 --> 11:38.405
Now we will see if this so-called
Wonder Woman deserves her reputation.

11:55.028 --> 11:57.758
So far, she shows nothing
that I couldn't match.

12:26.893 --> 12:30.056
No more games.
You have to tell the truth now.

12:31.431 --> 12:33.296
Where is Maj. Trevor?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.060
The truth is...

12:37.904 --> 12:40.429
The truth is exactly what?

12:44.043 --> 12:45.738
He's across the aisle...

12:46.345 --> 12:48.609
behind the first barrel on the left.

12:49.816 --> 12:51.147
Thank you.

12:53.953 --> 12:56.945
How can I succeed
when they assign me cowards?

12:57.023 --> 12:59.150
Mueller is the bravest man I know.

12:59.826 --> 13:02.021
That lasso must have strange powers.

13:03.062 --> 13:05.553
The power to force him to tell the truth?

13:06.466 --> 13:07.728
Extraordinary.

13:14.440 --> 13:15.498
Steve?

13:25.651 --> 13:27.846
I’ll have you free in a few seconds.

13:29.422 --> 13:32.084
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I’m fine.

13:32.191 --> 13:33.886
My pride's hurt a little bit.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.292
And once again, I’m in your debt,
Wonder Woman.

13:36.362 --> 13:38.330
I should never have fallen into this trap.

13:38.397 --> 13:40.627
I believe we were both tricked
into being here.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.065
Yes. But by whom?

13:42.869 --> 13:46.305
We'll find out. The important thing now
is to get to safety.

13:52.979 --> 13:54.970
Fräulein Grables!

13:58.417 --> 13:59.645
Yes, Mueller.

13:59.852 --> 14:02.912
It was incredible. I couldn't help myself.

14:03.289 --> 14:05.416
I had to tell her the truth.

14:05.525 --> 14:08.790
With a weapon like that,
we'll never capture Wonder Woman.

14:08.861 --> 14:12.126
That Golden Lasso
is exactly why we will capture her.

14:12.698 --> 14:16.429
My head is spinning, Fräulein.
You'll have to explain.

14:16.702 --> 14:18.795
Do you remember the Maginot Line?

14:19.338 --> 14:21.670
The Führer himself has taught us...

14:21.741 --> 14:25.643
how to turn an enemy's strength
into his greatest weakness.

14:26.579 --> 14:28.672
We must capture the Golden Lasso...

14:28.748 --> 14:32.309
and force Wonder Woman
to tell us her secrets.

14:32.518 --> 14:35.510
How do we find her?
She knows this was a trap.

14:35.922 --> 14:38.083
She'll never fall for a second one.

14:38.324 --> 14:41.691
We must have a plan
she will not be able to resist.

14:41.761 --> 14:43.695
I do not follow you, Fräulein.

14:43.930 --> 14:47.297
I will dress as Wonder Woman
and appear in public.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.436
She will be forced to confront
the obvious imposter.

14:51.804 --> 14:54.432
But can we handle her when she appears?

14:54.574 --> 14:56.565
We must have the proper setting.

14:57.410 --> 14:59.401
One that we can control.

14:59.745 --> 15:03.647
Yet one that Wonder Woman
would not suspect too strongly.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.910
We must appeal
to her sense of competition.

15:09.055 --> 15:11.523
I know just the occasion.

15:12.425 --> 15:15.394
The noontime bond rally
for Federal employees.

15:15.461 --> 15:17.895
Not too big, not too small.

15:18.631 --> 15:21.259
I know the man
in charge of the entertainment.

15:21.567 --> 15:25.094
He thinks I am an American Colonel...

15:25.171 --> 15:27.196
with the Special Services.

15:27.873 --> 15:31.570
Excellent. Then Wonder Woman
can feel patriotic...

15:31.811 --> 15:34.712
when she makes
her last American appearance.

15:42.021 --> 15:44.353
You're a wonderful crowd,
Ladies and gentlemen.

15:44.423 --> 15:46.391
And we have a wonderful guest
for you today.

15:46.459 --> 15:48.950
But before you meet her,
I want you to meet the man...

15:49.028 --> 15:51.394
who made this
memorable moment possible.

15:51.464 --> 15:53.193
A hero in his own right.

15:53.299 --> 15:56.359
Let's give a warm welcome
to Col. Edward Brown!

16:01.340 --> 16:03.137
It's an honor to be here.

16:03.209 --> 16:05.404
I know all you good people out there...

16:05.478 --> 16:09.608
appreciate the many patriotic feats
of our special guest.

16:10.883 --> 16:13.443
The one and only Wonder Woman!

16:15.187 --> 16:17.985
What a shame
Diana had an appointment to give blood.

16:18.057 --> 16:20.082
She's really gonna be sorry
she missed this.

16:20.159 --> 16:21.922
You're right. But don't worry.

16:21.994 --> 16:25.259
Someday I’ll arrange to introduce her
to Wonder Woman personally.

16:25.331 --> 16:29.358
And now, Wonder Woman
will use her fabulous strength...

16:29.435 --> 16:31.835
to establish our quota for today's rally.

16:31.904 --> 16:34.395
The harder she hits, the higher our goal.

16:43.115 --> 16:45.879
$10,000, ladies and gentlemen!

16:46.118 --> 16:50.282
Wonder Woman has set our goal high,
but we know you’ll meet the quota.

16:50.356 --> 16:53.519
Just a moment. I’ll set the quota.

17:00.299 --> 17:04.258
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can bring you two Wonder Women...

17:04.502 --> 17:08.439
surely you can afford to give Uncle Sam
twice as much from your wallets.

17:19.117 --> 17:21.313
You know what we're trying
to tell you, folks?

17:21.387 --> 17:24.617
The sky's the limit when it comes
to buying bonds.

17:25.691 --> 17:28.387
Isn’t this an original way
to help the war effort?

17:28.461 --> 17:30.156
It must be Wonder Woman's idea.

17:30.229 --> 17:32.094
Which one do you think is real?

17:32.164 --> 17:33.631
Is there any doubt?

17:33.733 --> 17:35.394
I'm sure you're wondering...

17:35.468 --> 17:39.029
which of my beautiful friends
is really Wonder Woman.

17:39.705 --> 17:43.334
Ladies, pick up that barbell,
and we'll find out.

18:25.951 --> 18:28.613
Obviously, folks,
that Wonder Woman's strength...

18:28.687 --> 18:31.053
didn't match the weight of the barbell.

18:36.595 --> 18:39.962
Now let's show our appreciation
to the real Wonder Woman...

18:40.032 --> 18:42.023
and buy those bonds.

18:42.101 --> 18:44.729
Come on, folks. Help win the war!

18:54.613 --> 18:58.276
Quick! Tell me. How do I make you
helpless and take you prisoner?

19:00.352 --> 19:03.219
Remove my Magic Belt.

19:03.456 --> 19:05.617
Is that the key to your strength?

19:06.192 --> 19:07.420
Yes.

19:09.061 --> 19:11.928
Away from my home on Paradise island.

19:12.498 --> 19:15.490
Will this chloroform
keep you unconscious?

19:16.869 --> 19:17.927
Yes.

19:22.174 --> 19:26.770
Sleep peacefully, Wonder Woman.
You will wake in the Fatherland.

19:35.788 --> 19:38.188
Wonder Woman,
we've been looking for you.

19:39.592 --> 19:43.551
- I only wanted to thank you for your help.
- Thank yous aren't necessary.

19:44.363 --> 19:47.662
You may look like Wonder Woman,
but you certainly don't act like her.

19:47.733 --> 19:49.166
Go, Colonel!

19:54.273 --> 19:56.434
Why is Wonder Woman wearing a mask?

19:56.609 --> 19:58.975
If I had her face, I’d never hide it.

19:59.044 --> 20:01.945
Because she isn't Wonder Woman.
Come on.

20:06.051 --> 20:07.279
Hold it!

20:08.587 --> 20:11.385
Air Corps Maj. Trevor.
I need your cab for urgent business.

20:11.457 --> 20:13.391
But I’m on my way
to pick up Senator Truman.

20:13.459 --> 20:14.448
He'll understand.

20:14.527 --> 20:16.859
They've captured Wonder Woman.

20:16.929 --> 20:17.918
Get in.

20:17.997 --> 20:21.228
I think this situation
calls for an experienced combat driver.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.632
- I’ll take the wheel.
- Of course, Major.

20:48.961 --> 20:52.260
- Their engine must be supercharged.
- We'll never catch them.

20:52.498 --> 20:54.090
I’ll try a shortcut.

21:08.814 --> 21:10.008
Steve!

21:59.365 --> 22:00.423
Quickly!

22:00.499 --> 22:04.094
Get the camouflage nets off the airplane
and get Wonder Woman inside.

22:04.169 --> 22:06.865
We have to take off
as soon as she's inside.

22:16.382 --> 22:18.577
- What's wrong?
- We've lost them.

22:18.984 --> 22:21.885
We're nearly out of gas
and I don't have any gas coupons.

22:21.954 --> 22:24.684
We'll just have to contact
the nearest military post.

22:24.757 --> 22:26.019
Wait a minute.

22:30.229 --> 22:31.423
What is it?

22:33.432 --> 22:36.526
There they are! Wait here.

22:43.342 --> 22:45.810
Mueller, look. It’s Maj. Trevor!

22:46.712 --> 22:48.737
Don't let him stop the airplane.

22:57.022 --> 22:59.513
Where are they taking Wonder Woman?
Tell me the truth.

22:59.591 --> 23:00.922
Do what you will with me.

23:00.993 --> 23:04.258
Your precious Wonder Woman
is on her way to the Fatherland.

23:17.042 --> 23:21.035
Germany! I can't allow you to go there.
That's sheer madness.

23:21.113 --> 23:24.674
Please, General. There's no telling
what the Nazis will do to Wonder Woman.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.513
I know how grateful you are to her...

23:26.585 --> 23:29.520
but organizing a rescue mission
to go inside enemy territory...

23:29.588 --> 23:30.919
is out of the question.

23:30.989 --> 23:34.857
Even the British Commandos haven't been
able to penetrate their coastal defenses.

23:34.927 --> 23:37.657
But they must've done
something terrible to Wonder Woman...

23:37.730 --> 23:39.254
if they could actually capture her.

23:39.331 --> 23:41.629
Think what this'll do
to our home front morale!

23:41.700 --> 23:45.966
Steve, every practical step is being taken.
But there's nothing more we can do.

23:46.171 --> 23:47.502
Try to forget it.

23:47.740 --> 23:51.232
After all, she is Wonder Woman.
Certainly she can take care of herself.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.608
Go rest for a few days.

23:54.113 --> 23:57.913
- But, General, you've got to try-
- That's an order, Major!

24:05.357 --> 24:08.884
Give up, Steve. It’s been hours
and you know it's hopeless.

24:10.295 --> 24:13.696
What if Gen. Blankenship comes
and finds you still working?

24:13.866 --> 24:14.958
Keep trying, men.

24:15.033 --> 24:18.366
That Nazi plane just might contact
their headquarters before landing.

24:18.437 --> 24:20.496
Talk about needles in haystacks.

24:20.572 --> 24:22.130
Calling Col. Kesselmann.

24:22.207 --> 24:24.971
Major! I think I’ve found
what you're looking for.

24:25.077 --> 24:28.137
...calling Col. Kesselmann at
Operation Fräulein Headquarters.

24:28.213 --> 24:31.910
We will arrive at 8.:00 a. m.
with Wonder Woman.

24:32.885 --> 24:34.318
I will be waiting.

24:34.653 --> 24:36.746
At least we know she's still alive.

24:36.822 --> 24:39.950
That's all the more reason
to try and find a way to get to her.

24:40.025 --> 24:43.927
I’ve got to, Etta. It’s my responsibility
after all she's done for me.

24:43.996 --> 24:46.658
- But the General won't let you-
- Wait a minute.

24:46.732 --> 24:48.859
The General! That's it!

24:49.434 --> 24:51.595
He wanted me to rest. All right.

24:51.804 --> 24:55.262
I’ll take my first furlough
behind Nazi lines.

24:55.607 --> 24:58.235
That doesn't sound very restful to me.

24:58.510 --> 25:02.241
Etta, you've got to promise
to cover for me with Gen. Blankenship.

25:02.548 --> 25:05.676
You tell him I’m resting, like he ordered,
out of town.

25:05.784 --> 25:07.775
- All right?
- Yes, Steve.

25:09.154 --> 25:11.714
- Would you give Diana a message for me?
- Of course.

25:11.790 --> 25:13.917
She's been working so hard lately.

25:14.526 --> 25:17.359
Have this note sent
special delivery to her apartment.

25:17.429 --> 25:20.364
"Dear Diana, I’m taking short furlough.

25:20.499 --> 25:22.763
"Suggest you take some time off, too.

25:23.535 --> 25:25.662
"Have fun. Steve. "

25:27.806 --> 25:29.000
Steve.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.208
Congratulations.
Now that your job is finished...

26:11.283 --> 26:15.276
I will be happy to arrange for your
transportation back to Berchtesgaden.

26:15.621 --> 26:19.352
That will not be necessary, mein Colonel.
I am staying here.

26:20.726 --> 26:23.092
Much as I would enjoy
your charming company...

26:23.161 --> 26:25.425
I cannot conduct a proper questioning...

26:25.497 --> 26:27.988
with unauthorized personnel
in attendance.

26:28.133 --> 26:31.728
But that will not be necessary.
You will not have to question her.

26:31.904 --> 26:33.269
I will do that.

26:33.839 --> 26:37.275
You are joking, of course.
You have no training, no experience.

26:37.676 --> 26:39.041
But I have this.

26:39.711 --> 26:41.542
Wonder Woman's Golden Lasso.

26:42.147 --> 26:45.878
It will force her to tell us the truth,
to answer our questions.

26:47.953 --> 26:51.912
You were sent to capture Wonder Woman,
not Dale Evans.

26:52.391 --> 26:55.360
But the device works. I have seen it.

26:55.560 --> 26:58.222
It is 100% reliable.

27:00.098 --> 27:02.123
Can you say the same for your methods?

27:02.200 --> 27:03.667
Come now, Fräulein.

27:03.835 --> 27:07.737
You are not one of those
disgusting glory-grabbers, are you?

27:08.273 --> 27:11.538
Now, you did your job.
Now, I will do mine.

27:13.912 --> 27:16.039
Bring the prisoner into my office!

27:24.957 --> 27:27.892
- Charlie Scott.
- Steve!

27:28.961 --> 27:32.362
Haven't seen you since you threw me
the touchdown pass in the Rose Bowl.

27:32.431 --> 27:34.661
- How'd you get to England?
- Remember Sparky Eason?

27:34.733 --> 27:36.860
I stowed away
on one of the bombers he ferries.

27:36.935 --> 27:40.598
- Do anything to escape Washington, huh?
- Not exactly.

27:43.709 --> 27:47.839
I need to get to Operation Fräulein
Headquarters behind Nazi lines.

27:47.913 --> 27:51.576
Behind Nazi lines? That's a big order.
Where is Operation Fräulein?

27:51.750 --> 27:54.275
I was hoping you could break the code
and tell me.

27:54.353 --> 27:57.880
I can put you in touch with a contact
in the German Underground who can.

27:57.956 --> 27:59.890
I’m going on a mission over Berlin tonight.

27:59.958 --> 28:02.449
Tonight? If we hurry,
you can give me a lift.

28:02.527 --> 28:03.994
What's this all about?

28:04.062 --> 28:06.530
Why don't I fill you in
on the flight over, okay?

28:31.189 --> 28:33.350
- Maj. Trevor?
- Yes.

28:33.525 --> 28:34.514
Good.

28:37.396 --> 28:38.454
I am Rojak.

28:38.530 --> 28:41.226
We have discovered the location
of Operation Fräulein.

28:41.299 --> 28:43.290
- Good.
- We go.

29:09.027 --> 29:10.153
Halt!

29:12.130 --> 29:13.859
Do you have papers?

29:14.266 --> 29:17.724
Yeah. I am carrying both the papers.

29:22.207 --> 29:25.973
They seem to be in order.
Be off the streets before curfew, Rojak.

29:26.044 --> 29:27.671
Jawohl, Herr Corporal.

29:31.249 --> 29:34.844
Those papers were not real.
Why did you let them go?

29:35.287 --> 29:38.745
The man they call Rojak
is an undercover agent for the Gestapo.

29:41.026 --> 29:45.326
Mein Colonel, I have no desire
to usurp your authority.

29:45.397 --> 29:49.265
As long as the Fatherland benefits,
I don't care who gets the credit.

29:49.868 --> 29:52.428
We are to discover
Wonder Woman's secrets...

29:52.504 --> 29:54.972
and use them to benefit the Fatherland.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.237
Then why don't you return to your work
and let me do mine?

29:58.310 --> 30:02.440
Because we can accomplish our objective
so easily with the Golden Lasso.

30:03.415 --> 30:04.609
Here.

30:07.919 --> 30:09.284
You use it.

30:11.089 --> 30:12.784
I know the ploy, Fräulein.

30:13.024 --> 30:16.983
You are trying to make me look ridiculous
in front of my men.

30:17.562 --> 30:20.998
I am trying only to convince you
of the truth.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.060
Watch!

30:24.269 --> 30:26.464
Wonder Woman,
where do you come from?

30:28.974 --> 30:32.171
- I come from Paradise island.
- Paradise island?

30:33.979 --> 30:36.447
And that is on the map?

30:37.315 --> 30:40.478
No. It’s not on any map.

30:40.652 --> 30:42.745
Because there is no such place.

30:42.954 --> 30:46.253
Can't you see she is obviously
trying to trick us, Fräulein.

30:46.791 --> 30:48.281
What makes you so strong?

30:48.360 --> 30:50.828
On Paradise island, there are only women.

30:51.663 --> 30:53.858
Because of this pure environment...

30:54.299 --> 30:57.564
we are able to develop our minds
and our physical skills...

30:57.969 --> 31:00.665
unhampered by
masculine destructiveness.

31:00.739 --> 31:03.799
Stop! Such information is utter rubbish!

31:03.975 --> 31:06.944
Can't you see she is trying
to make fools out of us?

31:07.679 --> 31:09.010
Perhaps not.

31:09.581 --> 31:12.778
It is an interesting theory she advances.

31:13.185 --> 31:17.713
I refuse to let you waste
any more time, Fräulein.

31:20.926 --> 31:22.951
Now take that Lasso off...

31:23.128 --> 31:26.495
and bring the prisoner
into the questioning chamber.

31:29.201 --> 31:30.998
We will do this my way.

31:38.443 --> 31:39.535
Wait.

31:40.412 --> 31:42.607
This German countryside is confusing.

31:42.681 --> 31:44.876
I’d almost swear we're traveling in circles.

31:44.950 --> 31:47.578
It’s part of our diversionary tactics,
Major.

31:47.819 --> 31:50.310
How much further to
Operation Fräulein headquarters?

31:50.388 --> 31:51.616
Not very long.

31:51.690 --> 31:53.317
Then let's keep moving.

32:05.904 --> 32:07.064
Yes, sir?

32:07.572 --> 32:11.736
- Has Maj. Trevor left on furlough yet?
- Yes, sir.

32:13.245 --> 32:16.339
Steve finally had the good sense
to take a rest.

32:17.983 --> 32:20.645
That's the best news
I’ve heard this morning.

32:21.386 --> 32:24.184
- Did he say where he was going?
- Well...

32:24.556 --> 32:25.955
Don't answer that!

32:26.291 --> 32:29.351
If I knew where he was,
I might be tempted to call him.

32:30.061 --> 32:34.088
And what Steve really needs
is a chance to relax.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.938
And now we will all learn the truth.

32:45.010 --> 32:46.978
Then why don't you ask her about this?

32:47.045 --> 32:49.343
It has something to do with her strength.

32:49.414 --> 32:50.904
Put it away!

32:51.016 --> 32:52.779
One more interruption from you...

32:52.851 --> 32:56.116
and I will send you back to Berchtesgaden
with armed guard!

32:56.187 --> 32:58.018
Gut. And why not?

32:58.256 --> 33:00.781
I will gladly present my case to the Führer.

33:01.293 --> 33:02.760
He would see instantly...

33:02.827 --> 33:05.921
that this Golden Lasso
is all we need to get the truth.

33:06.331 --> 33:09.926
The truth? An island of women?

33:10.635 --> 33:12.660
Such a place wouldn't last a week.

33:12.737 --> 33:16.764
We have existed in peace and happiness
for 26 centuries.

33:17.609 --> 33:22.012
You give answers like that to the Führer,
and he'll have you both put away as mad.

33:23.014 --> 33:26.882
Fräulein Grables, you are a woman
of great intelligence...

33:26.951 --> 33:29.613
and should not be taking orders
from that man.

33:29.688 --> 33:30.848
Silence!

33:30.922 --> 33:33.823
Now I have had enough
from both of you Wonder Women.

33:33.892 --> 33:36.486
And you, with your
supposed magic tricks...

33:37.295 --> 33:39.661
the Golden Lasso, the Magic Belt.

33:40.565 --> 33:41.554
Nonsense!

34:02.654 --> 34:04.451
We'll handle this ourselves.

34:04.723 --> 34:06.156
Stop her, Fräulein!

34:10.295 --> 34:12.592
You were right all the time, Fräulein.

34:13.130 --> 34:15.031
Why do you listen to him now?

34:15.800 --> 34:18.324
This time I must agree with the Colonel.

34:19.237 --> 34:21.534
You are an enemy of the Fatherland.

34:43.495 --> 34:46.862
- Hold on, Rojak.
- What's wrong, Major? Getting tired?

34:47.031 --> 34:50.626
You're leading me through here
for the third time. Now what's going on?

34:50.702 --> 34:55.105
What is going on, Major,
is the conclusion of your mission.

34:55.873 --> 34:58.001
I appeal to your womanhood.

34:58.076 --> 35:01.477
Do you want children growing up
under tyrants like Kesselmann?

35:01.980 --> 35:04.881
Someday we will meet
without your trick devices.

35:06.251 --> 35:08.549
I hope we meet when you see the truth.

35:13.124 --> 35:15.388
This is not the way it was planned...

35:15.760 --> 35:17.921
but I’m going to shoot you as a spy.

35:18.496 --> 35:19.861
You won't succeed.

35:20.365 --> 35:24.461
There's somebody behind you getting
ready to crack your skull with a shovel.

35:26.871 --> 35:28.338
You disappoint me.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.503
You think a member of the Nazi elite
would fall for that old trick?

35:35.180 --> 35:37.648
- Thanks, whoever you are.
- Don't thank me.

35:37.849 --> 35:40.613
We suspected this man
might be a double agent.

35:40.885 --> 35:43.752
But it was Maj. Scott's idea
for me to follow you.

35:43.855 --> 35:44.879
Good old Charlie!

35:44.956 --> 35:47.948
He always was the best man
on the team for running interference.

35:48.026 --> 35:48.958
Thanks.

35:49.027 --> 35:51.393
Come. I will show you where the castle is.

36:30.869 --> 36:33.702
- Where is Wonder Woman?
- She has escaped, Herr Colonel.

36:33.771 --> 36:35.238
Alert all units. Find her.

36:35.306 --> 36:39.504
She may be out of this headquarters,
but she cannot get out of the Fatherland.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.887
You stopped me from doing my job.

38:05.063 --> 38:07.691
And I am going to see
that the Führer knows it.

38:08.900 --> 38:10.959
Get your hands up, both of you.

38:11.035 --> 38:12.366
What is this?

38:12.437 --> 38:14.905
- Where's Wonder Woman?
- She's gone, Major.

38:14.973 --> 38:18.465
I’m not falling for that. I know you
kidnapped her and I know she's here.

38:18.543 --> 38:21.637
It’s true. Wonder Woman has escaped.

38:22.547 --> 38:24.037
But you won't, Major.

38:24.716 --> 38:28.117
You will be shot as a spy, as I promised.

38:45.303 --> 38:48.704
I can't find Steve this evening.
Is he in with the General?

38:49.173 --> 38:52.939
He took a brief furlough
and he told you to take some time off, too.

38:53.077 --> 38:55.409
Didn't you get Steve's
special delivered note?

38:55.480 --> 38:58.574
Oh, yes. But I thought
he was back by now.

38:59.117 --> 39:01.017
Do you know where Steve went?

39:01.919 --> 39:03.978
He asked me not to tell.

39:04.389 --> 39:07.051
So please be my friend, Diana. Don't ask.

39:07.992 --> 39:10.620
Okay. If that's the way
you and Steve want it.

39:10.762 --> 39:12.923
I just hope he's getting some rest.

39:13.798 --> 39:16.926
I can't believe this! The Message Center
must have made a mistake.

39:17.001 --> 39:18.025
What is it?

39:18.102 --> 39:21.230
Berlin Underground just forwarded
a message saying Steve Trevor...

39:21.305 --> 39:24.638
is a prisoner at Gestapo Headquarters
behind enemy lines.

39:24.709 --> 39:27.837
Something about Operation Fräulein.

39:31.282 --> 39:33.807
You told me that Steve is on furlough.

39:34.919 --> 39:37.012
I never thought he'd be captured.

39:37.088 --> 39:40.182
Etta, I think you'd better tell us
everything you know.

39:40.525 --> 39:42.823
You can say that again, Yeoman Prince.

39:43.561 --> 39:46.894
Wonder Woman was taken prisoner
and Steve went to save her.

39:46.964 --> 39:49.398
He flew to England
with a bomber pilot friend...

39:49.467 --> 39:51.162
and some other friend in the O.S.S...

39:51.235 --> 39:54.136
was going to parachute drop him
over Nazi territory.

39:54.205 --> 39:56.867
So Steve cares about Wonder Woman
that much?

39:56.974 --> 39:58.236
Yes, sir.

39:58.376 --> 40:00.105
Can't we do something?

40:00.178 --> 40:03.045
Yes, what about
our Underground in Germany?

40:03.114 --> 40:04.638
They're not much help right now.

40:04.716 --> 40:07.480
We've just discovered
they're riddled with double agents.

40:07.552 --> 40:11.420
The same message also reports that
Wonder Woman has apparently escaped.

40:12.023 --> 40:14.150
I just hope she knows about Steve.

40:15.159 --> 40:18.720
We'll do our best, but I’m afraid
Steve doesn't have much chance.

40:20.031 --> 40:22.192
I know how you feel, Yeoman Prince.

40:22.734 --> 40:24.929
These are tough times for all of us.

40:25.103 --> 40:27.469
Why don't you take a few more days off?

40:27.939 --> 40:29.236
Thank you, sir.

41:25.129 --> 41:28.030
Message Center?
This is Gen. Blankenship.

41:28.733 --> 41:31.429
What is your latest information
on Maj. Trevor?

41:45.183 --> 41:48.584
I still say we must execute this spy.

41:49.420 --> 41:51.183
No! Not yet!

41:52.156 --> 41:56.058
Maj. Trevor is our bait
to recapture Wonder Woman.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.321
That's idiotic.

41:57.395 --> 42:02.094
Once out of here, Wonder Woman would
never risk returning for a mere Major.

42:02.266 --> 42:05.497
I have seen the looks she gives this man.

42:05.736 --> 42:09.001
Now that we have leaked
word of his capture to Washington...

42:09.073 --> 42:10.597
she will be back.

42:11.242 --> 42:14.803
And then we will have
both of America's greatest heroes.

42:35.633 --> 42:37.692
Now that we have Wonder Woman back...

42:37.768 --> 42:41.534
I assure you that we will use
a trap door and cistern...

42:41.606 --> 42:43.301
to capture and hold her.

42:43.741 --> 42:44.969
Please, Fräulein.

42:45.042 --> 42:48.569
Do not annoy me anymore
with your amateur suggestions.

42:49.313 --> 42:51.907
I have the matter well in hand.

43:02.760 --> 43:07.026
I won't be held responsible for
allowing Wonder Woman to escape twice.

43:07.632 --> 43:11.159
No. This time, she must be destroyed.

43:11.502 --> 43:12.491
No!

43:13.571 --> 43:16.131
If the Fatherland can't learn her secrets...

43:16.540 --> 43:19.907
at least we can see to
they are no use to America.

43:32.023 --> 43:34.355
- Wonder Woman!
- Steve, are you all right?

43:34.425 --> 43:36.950
Get out fast! I know this is a trap for you.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.747
- They're going to crush us.
- Hurry.

44:04.889 --> 44:07.517
- The chains are weakening.
- It’s too late.

44:12.630 --> 44:16.896
Wonder Woman, I want to thank you
for all you've done for me in this lifetime.

44:43.961 --> 44:46.429
Now we will use the water trap.

44:47.431 --> 44:49.262
Rojas, block the door!

45:07.385 --> 45:09.319
When I pull this switch...

45:09.954 --> 45:14.186
these cables will lower
50,000 volts of electricity into the water.

45:16.694 --> 45:19.458
The powerful Wonder Woman
has nothing to say?

45:21.198 --> 45:23.666
Perhaps now you will tell us your secrets.

45:24.035 --> 45:28.267
If I speak, it will only be
to the woman who captured me.

45:28.472 --> 45:30.303
She did not capture you.

45:30.374 --> 45:33.309
I am the commander here.
You are my prisoner.

45:34.145 --> 45:36.010
I designed this water trap.

45:36.380 --> 45:38.439
And if I had not acted...

45:38.649 --> 45:40.981
this water trap would not have been used.

45:41.052 --> 45:43.646
And our country's enemies
would have escaped.

45:43.988 --> 45:48.391
I will no longer tolerate
any of your meddling interferences.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.959
Grab her, Rojas!

45:54.265 --> 45:55.755
Berlin will hear of this!

45:55.833 --> 45:58.927
Berlin will hear only that you allowed
Wonder Woman to escape...

45:59.003 --> 46:02.700
and that you died in my successful effort
to recapture her.

46:03.574 --> 46:06.907
Fausta, now do you see
your real enemies?

46:07.745 --> 46:10.942
Rojas, throw Fräulein Grables
into the water tank!

46:11.082 --> 46:13.380
I will personally pull the switch!

46:13.584 --> 46:16.052
Now do you see
how little you mean to them?

46:23.227 --> 46:26.196
Quick! Wonder Woman! Grab the rope!

46:47.251 --> 46:49.412
I have turned the current high enough...

46:49.487 --> 46:52.718
so that they cannot get out of the tank
without getting shocked.

46:52.790 --> 46:55.418
They will stay there. We'd better go.

46:55.860 --> 46:56.849
Hurry.

47:05.002 --> 47:08.267
We want to repay you.
Come back to America with us.

47:09.206 --> 47:11.538
No. I cannot leave my homeland.

47:11.609 --> 47:14.077
But every Nazi in the country
will be looking for you.

47:14.145 --> 47:16.272
And I will be looking for them.

47:16.380 --> 47:19.645
I must show the world
that we're not all Kesselmanns.

47:20.117 --> 47:21.846
You are very courageous...

47:22.653 --> 47:24.450
but you cannot fight alone.

47:24.588 --> 47:26.954
I will find others who feel as I do.

47:27.691 --> 47:29.318
Maybe I can help.

47:34.231 --> 47:37.428
She's with the Underground.
She'll arrange for everything you need.

47:37.501 --> 47:38.763
Thank you.

47:38.836 --> 47:42.829
Thank you. You are an example
to women all over the world...

47:42.907 --> 47:44.397
who want to be free.

47:45.376 --> 47:49.278
And you showed me the way.
And now I must show others.

47:51.949 --> 47:52.938
Come.

48:00.824 --> 48:04.419
Will Gen. Blankenship be upset
at the way you got into Germany?

48:04.495 --> 48:07.658
He might have been,
but before leaving Gestapo Headquarters...

48:07.731 --> 48:09.995
I opened Col. Kesselmann's safe.

48:10.234 --> 48:14.068
Our country now has a list of
every double agent in the Nazi spy ring.

48:14.538 --> 48:17.166
I don't think
the General will be too unhappy.

48:19.176 --> 48:22.737
You have brought us six months closer
to the end of the war.

48:26.483 --> 48:27.848
You're wonderful.

48:30.187 --> 48:32.587
You're not so bad yourself,
Wonder Woman.

48:45.402 --> 48:48.064
Are you sure you got some rest
while you were away?

48:48.138 --> 48:51.301
Well, you know those resorts.
So many activities.

48:51.809 --> 48:53.902
Yeah... activities!

48:54.411 --> 48:57.141
I want to hear
about every one of them at lunch.

48:58.382 --> 49:00.009
Good morning, everyone.

49:00.484 --> 49:03.715
Was your report to the General
typed in good order, Major?

49:04.221 --> 49:05.950
Perfect as always, Diana.

49:06.056 --> 49:09.583
Can you tell us the whole story
of how you escaped from Germany?

49:09.994 --> 49:11.928
Sorry. Let me put it this way.

49:11.996 --> 49:15.625
Things happened over there
that are not fit for a lady's ears.

49:18.002 --> 49:20.402
Isn’t he always the perfect gentleman?

49:22.239 --> 49:23.467
Perfect.

49:24.708 --> 49:28.235
Here's the first report
from our new agent, Fausta Grables.

49:28.312 --> 49:30.007
Thank you very much, Diana.

49:30.080 --> 49:33.846
The General was most impressed that
she chose to stay behind and fight for us.

49:33.917 --> 49:36.818
That's very dangerous work.
I don't see how she does it.

49:36.887 --> 49:40.084
Maybe all women can do wonders
if put to the test.

49:41.225 --> 49:43.523
That's exactly what Wonder Woman said.

49:44.762 --> 49:45.922
It is?

50:18.095 --> 50:19.119
English
