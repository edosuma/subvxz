WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.375
Whoo! Go, Randy!
Yeah!

00:04.458 --> 00:06.125
Come on, Randy!
Come on, buddy!

00:06.208 --> 00:08.166
- Yeah! Way to go, Randy!
- Way to go. Whoo!

00:08.250 --> 00:09.709
All right, come on, Milton, you got this.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.417
- Yeah, hang in there, Milton.
- Let's go, bro.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.083
You're about to shatter your old record.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.000
What...

00:19.291 --> 00:20.667
What a rush!

00:20.750 --> 00:23.667
The wind in my hair.
The adrenaline pumping.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.125
Dude, your skating's a joke.

00:26.208 --> 00:30.917
The sweet air I caught
when I ran over that pebble was no joke.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.083
That pebble was my pinky toe.

00:34.917 --> 00:35.792
All right, Jack,

00:35.875 --> 00:37.291
- Let's see what you can do.
- Yeah, man.

00:37.375 --> 00:38.834
I've got some moves I've been working on.

00:38.917 --> 00:42.041
-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:42.125 --> 00:44.083
-
Mm-hmm.

00:44.166 --> 00:45.917
What do you think you're doing?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.125
- I'll take this.
- Oh, come on, Joan.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.834
I'm sorry, but I've got a job to do.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.166
-
- Ah.

00:53.083 --> 00:55.417
And it's to teach you punks how to shred.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.625
Huh? Check it.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.583
This skate rat can grind it
like a coffee bean.

01:02.917 --> 01:05.750
And... whoo!

01:17.041 --> 01:19.041
That was sweet!

01:19.125 --> 01:20.959
Good thing my boss, Mr. Peters,
didn't see that.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.041
We call him ratface.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.041
Hey, ratface. Ooh!

01:25.125 --> 01:29.458
Mr. Peters, uh, I was just doing
a little undercover sting operation

01:29.542 --> 01:31.875
I like to call Operation undercover...

01:31.959 --> 01:33.959
Sting operation.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.667
And anyone caught skateboarding

01:36.750 --> 01:38.875
will be banned from this mall. <i>'prende?</i> ?

01:39.709 --> 01:41.959
- What?
- Great!

01:42.041 --> 01:44.875
Uh, first, the skatepark closes,

01:44.959 --> 01:46.458
and now, we can't skate here.

01:46.542 --> 01:49.917
Fine. They may ban our boards,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.291
but they'll never ban our spirit.

01:52.375 --> 01:53.333
Yeah.

01:54.792 --> 01:56.709
- Eddie.
- Oh, yeah.

Come on, guys. We gotta think.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.583
Uh, there's gotta be another place
we can skateboard.

02:47.583 --> 02:50.041
Well, there's that paved path
through the cemetery.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.542
That's not gonna happen.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.417
With my deliciously plump brain,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.125
I'm considered grade-A zombie bait.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.291
Look, when I was a kid,
we didn't need skateparks.

03:00.417 --> 03:03.542
We used to make up our own games,
like "What's That Smell?"

03:03.625 --> 03:06.417
Or "Whose Hair Is This?"
Or "Why Is That Wet?"

03:07.917 --> 03:09.625
Look, we just need a place to skate.

03:09.709 --> 03:12.041
I don't even understand
why skateboarding's so cool.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.375
When I was in school,
the only person who was into it

03:14.458 --> 03:16.208
was a kid named Luke Sampson.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.792
You know, I will prove that I am a ninja

03:20.875 --> 03:23.875
by showing you
my super-fast ninja reflexes.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.792
All right? Now you just try
and take this raisin out of my ha--

03:26.875 --> 03:28.166
Dude, I wasn't even ready!

03:29.458 --> 03:31.750
And you don't ever eat a ninja's raisin!

03:31.834 --> 03:32.750
Hey, Rudy.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.875
Ugh. What do you want, Luke?

03:35.959 --> 03:38.667
I'm going outside to jump over
the dumpster on my skateboard.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.250
- You wanna watch?
- No.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.542
We're getting ready to start a sweet game
of "What's That Smell?"

03:47.792 --> 03:49.166
Dude needs to get a life.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.667
Now let's try this one more ti--

03:51.750 --> 03:53.583
Dude, I wasn't ready!

03:54.083 --> 03:57.125
I wonder whatever happened to that loser.

03:57.208 --> 04:01.125
Uh, actually, he became
a multi-millionaire skateboard mogul.

04:03.542 --> 04:04.542
What?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.709
He just released a cool new body spray
called "Damp".

04:08.792 --> 04:10.583
I love their slogan.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.250
"Damp. When moist isn't enough."

04:15.417 --> 04:16.709
Wait a minute.

04:16.792 --> 04:19.834
Guys, he builds skateparks
all over the country.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.750
Maybe we can get him
to build one right here.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.625
Yeah. Rudy, since you know him,
can you get us a meeting?

04:24.709 --> 04:26.667
What? Uh, yeah.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.542
Yeah. No, Luke's my boy.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.375
We were tight.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.917
And just so you guys know,

04:35.417 --> 04:37.291
I've been working on my own body spray.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.166
It's called "Midnight Ninja".

04:39.250 --> 04:41.375
It's the smell you never see coming.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.083
Silent but deadly.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.875
Ooh, that'd be a good slogan.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.875
Uh, it wasn't a slogan, it was a warning.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.250
Luke, thanks so much for seeing us.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.166
It's pretty incredible, right?

05:09.250 --> 05:10.917
We came from the same school,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.291
and look at us now.

05:12.375 --> 05:15.750
You, with your international business
and helicopters,

05:15.834 --> 05:17.125
and me, with my--

05:18.458 --> 05:19.583
I don't wanna brag.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.000
No, go ahead, Rudy.

05:22.792 --> 05:23.834
Brag.

05:25.375 --> 05:28.125
Uh, well, I, I... I was asked to endorse

05:28.208 --> 05:33.166
a chain of martial-arts themed bakeries

05:33.250 --> 05:36.375
called Tae-kwon Donuts.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.792
In your face, Kim. Hm.

05:40.625 --> 05:41.917
Yeah, so anyway,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.125
this is our research and training center.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.875
Now, we test every product
we come up with.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.959
Sampson isn't just a board.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.583
It's a lifestyle.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.792
Yo, we even developed
our own organic skater snacks.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.500
- Try a seaweed doodler.
- Oh.

06:02.417 --> 06:05.375
Too much seaweed, not enough doodler.

06:05.792 --> 06:06.709
Hm.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.834
- Hey.
- Welcome to L.S. Industries.

06:12.917 --> 06:14.458
Are you the guys
we're supposed to work with?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.083
Well, actually, we're just-- Mm!

06:16.166 --> 06:18.125
Yes. Yes, we are.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.625
So you're ready to do this?

06:19.709 --> 06:21.250
My middle name is "Do this."

06:21.291 --> 06:23.041
I thought your middle name was Caesar?

06:23.959 --> 06:26.417
Which is Spanish for "Do this."

06:29.166 --> 06:30.500
The thing I remember about you, Rudy,

06:30.583 --> 06:33.000
is you used to love
to wear your pajamas to school.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.875
-
- It was a warrior gi.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.250
So, what can I do for you guys?

06:39.333 --> 06:42.792
Mr. Sampson, you build skateparks
all over the country.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.583
- Mm-hmm.
- We were hoping that...

06:45.083 --> 06:46.959
you could build one in our hometown.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.208
Are there real skaters in Seaford now?

06:49.291 --> 06:51.375
When I was growing up, I was the only one.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.083
"Are there skaters in Seaford?"

06:53.166 --> 06:54.542
Uh, hello.

06:54.959 --> 06:57.709
Lemme see this. Yeah.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.083
Here you go, Jack.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.208
Yup. Get ready for it.

07:03.291 --> 07:04.959
You're gonna kill it out there.

07:06.458 --> 07:07.542
Hey.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.875
Whoa!
-

07:15.959 --> 07:17.083
Whoa, whoa!

07:19.458 --> 07:21.792
Right on. I'll give it to you, Jack,
you can skate.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.542
I might be interested
in building your skatepark.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.834
Great! We've got the perfect spot.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.583
Cool, let's go check it out.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.834
Yo, but first, let's pound
some Luke Sampson eel juice, huh?

07:38.834 --> 07:41.125
Whoo! Oh yeah, there's the energy.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.000
What do you think, Rudy?

07:43.083 --> 07:44.583
That's some good eel.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.875
Huh? Great spot, huh? What do you think?

07:54.667 --> 07:56.667
- give me a second, man.
-

07:56.750 --> 07:57.875
I gotta feel this.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.792
Bam! There's your ramp.

08:05.875 --> 08:08.083
Ka-pow! 12-foot grind rail.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.166
Boom! There's your half-pipe.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.709
Hold on.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.375
Switch the boom and the ka-pow,

08:14.458 --> 08:16.291
- now you got a skatepark, bro!
- Yeah!

08:16.375 --> 08:17.959
Hey, oh, if we have any room left,

08:18.041 --> 08:20.291
- we should put a bang over there!
- Ha!

08:20.417 --> 08:21.625
But what's a bang?

08:22.250 --> 08:23.917
I was kinda hoping you knew.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

08:29.041 --> 08:30.417
There she is.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.875
The old widowmaker.

08:33.291 --> 08:36.542
When I was a kid,
all I wanted to do was climb that tree.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.834
But mother said no, I'd get hurt.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.542
Well, Ma ain't here now, is she?

08:49.792 --> 08:50.709
Aww.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.333
Check it out. What is that, a rat?

08:53.417 --> 08:56.000
-
- Relax, Helen.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.500
<i>I don't think it's a rat.</i>

09:00.583 --> 09:01.834
Let me get a picture of it.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.917
Ugh! Up close, that thing is creepy.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.792
That's you.

09:09.792 --> 09:10.625
Oh.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.291
You know what, guys?
This place is perfect.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.291
Let's fast-track it.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.291
- I bet we can break ground in a week.
- Awesome!

09:20.417 --> 09:21.625
- All right.
- I can't believe it.

09:21.709 --> 09:24.000
<i>I'm almost there. almost--</i>

09:24.083 --> 09:25.583
- <i>Oh!</i>
-

09:29.917 --> 09:31.834
<i>Do not call my mother!</i>

09:33.917 --> 09:35.125
All right, we're here to make sure

09:35.208 --> 09:37.875
the new Sampson skate gear
is 100 percent safe.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.542
I'll tell you what's not safe.

09:39.625 --> 09:40.834
This guy.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.750
So get on your boards and drop in.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.291
Okay. Yeah.

09:48.834 --> 09:50.792
I don't know how to drop in!

09:52.041 --> 09:53.166
Yeah, you do.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.875
They could be our girlfriends, man.

09:54.959 --> 09:56.458
Okay, all right.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.041
- You ready?
- Whew!

10:01.542 --> 10:03.667
Whoa!
-

10:03.750 --> 10:06.667
-
<i>Wow.</i>

10:06.750 --> 10:08.250
You guys did great.

10:08.333 --> 10:11.083
- How'd those pads feel?
- Not bad.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.750
You're pretty.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.000
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

10:19.875 --> 10:21.917
What happened to you guys?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.083
Girls. Girls happened.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.458
This is awesome!

10:27.542 --> 10:30.291
Because of you, Seaford is getting
their own skatepark.

10:30.750 --> 10:34.208
Sweet! This is the happiest moment
of my life.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.667
At least until I marry Kim Crawford.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.667
Okay, settle down, Randy.

10:40.667 --> 10:43.667
You got it, Mrs. Plotzsky.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.625
-
- Kim, what's in your backpack?

10:55.667 --> 10:59.333
Aww. It's the little guy
from the skatepark site!

10:59.917 --> 11:01.041
How did you get in here?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.834
Were you in my backy-packy?

11:02.917 --> 11:06.041
Yes, you were. Yes, you were!

11:06.750 --> 11:09.625
Why do girls always talk
like that to animals?

11:09.709 --> 11:10.917
Just 'cause he's a...

11:12.792 --> 11:14.041
fluffy little man.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.834
Yes. Yes, you are.

11:16.917 --> 11:20.125
You're a fluffy little man! Yes, you are.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.458
What? He's a fluffy Little man.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.125
I actually did a little research.

11:28.917 --> 11:31.750
It's commonly known
as the striped beach vole.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.625
Interesting fact.
They're very territorial,

11:34.709 --> 11:36.625
and live five miles
from any of their kind.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.375
Five miles?

11:39.917 --> 11:42.375
What do they do for... Girlfriends?

11:43.375 --> 11:45.000
They have a piercing mating call.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.542
It sounds something like this.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.750
Br-r-r-roo hoo! Br-r-r-roo hoo!

11:52.834 --> 11:55.291
- Br-r-r-roo hoo!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.375
<i>Look at the way
he's looking at you.</i>

11:57.458 --> 11:59.375
Milton's got game.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.375
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

12:01.458 --> 12:04.542
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

12:05.083 --> 12:06.583
It's a pretty good turnout, huh?

12:06.959 --> 12:08.583
Yeah, I should probably say a few words.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.583
Citizens of Seaford,

12:10.667 --> 12:12.625
I will now say a few words.

12:13.792 --> 12:16.625
This park is the result of one man.

12:16.709 --> 12:19.208
- Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke!
- No, I was talking about me.

12:19.291 --> 12:20.917
I was the one who called him.
I did everything.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.917
This park shan't be for a select few,

12:26.291 --> 12:28.709
but 'tis for each and every one of you.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.000
So we're all going
to the ground-breaking party?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.375
No! And if you get anywhere near
the VIP tent,

12:33.500 --> 12:35.667
security will tase you
out of your shoes, bro.

12:37.792 --> 12:38.750
Thank you.

12:41.417 --> 12:45.125
- Yo, yo, what's up, Seaford!
- Luke, Luke, Luke!

12:45.208 --> 12:47.792
Excuse me, Luke. I, uh--
I need to say something.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.917
I hate to ruin the celebration, everybody,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.625
but, uh, we can't build a skatepark here.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.125
What?
- Oh, come on.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.500
Well, why not, Kim?

12:56.583 --> 12:59.750
Because this site is home
to the rare striped beach vole.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.959
It's a protected species,
and we can't destroy its home.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.375
<i>Yeah, VIP Party!</i>

13:08.125 --> 13:09.458
<i>Not on the list, Rudy!</i>

13:10.166 --> 13:13.625
She zapped me, bro.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.625
<i>Oh, my bad, Rudy.
You are on the list.</i>

13:23.417 --> 13:25.709
Do you know how unpopular
this is gonna make us?

13:25.792 --> 13:27.166
- Jack, you're overreacting.
-

13:27.250 --> 13:29.583
I think most people at this school
will totally agree with what I--

13:29.667 --> 13:31.959
Mob! Mob! Mob!

13:32.041 --> 13:34.709
Angry, scary mob. Mob!

13:39.500 --> 13:41.709
Pitchforks? Really, Randy?

13:41.792 --> 13:44.208
- Isn't that a bit much?
- They're not with us.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.875
They're in the Agriculture Club.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.000
You ruined it for all of us, Kim.

13:49.083 --> 13:52.291
- You and your rat.
- Look, Randy, it's done.

13:52.375 --> 13:54.291
Tomorrow, when the wildlife inspector
shows up

13:54.417 --> 13:55.667
and sees the vole on the land,

13:55.750 --> 13:58.000
he'll declare it
a protected animal sanctuary,

13:58.083 --> 13:59.500
then no one can ever build on it.

13:59.583 --> 14:02.125
Well, he won't call it
a protected animal sanctuary

14:02.208 --> 14:04.250
if the vole isn't there.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.000
Why wouldn't the vole be there?

14:06.083 --> 14:08.000
<i>Because he's gonna try
and kill it.</i>

14:08.542 --> 14:10.375
- Shut up, locker!
-

14:10.542 --> 14:12.208
<i>Ow.</i>

14:13.125 --> 14:14.709
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

14:15.417 --> 14:17.875
So I think I've got a fix
for this vole situation.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.375
Can you imagine if I spent
a quarter of a million dollars

14:20.458 --> 14:21.959
on a piece of land I couldn't use?

14:22.041 --> 14:24.041
I hear that.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.041
I just spent 19 dollars on a scarf,

14:26.125 --> 14:28.291
tried to return it,
they wouldn't take it back.

14:28.375 --> 14:31.166
Pfft! Mo' money, mo' problems.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.417
- Am I right?
-

14:33.917 --> 14:34.959
Anyway, um,

14:35.750 --> 14:40.417
I'm really glad we didn't let this little
fly in the ointment derail us, you know?

14:40.500 --> 14:44.875
The important thing is, we're friends
and we've reconnected, you know?

14:44.959 --> 14:47.667
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.959
Hey, Luke, uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:52.041 --> 14:54.667
Sure. Rudy, be right back.

14:54.750 --> 14:58.500
Absolutely. I'm just gonna
keep an eye on things around here,

14:58.583 --> 15:00.583
make sure everything keeps running smooth.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.208
Whoa!

15:03.083 --> 15:05.208
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.

15:05.291 --> 15:08.250
I know it may seem kinda silly,
but Kim feels really strongly about--

15:08.333 --> 15:10.500
- Jack, Jack, relax.
-

15:10.583 --> 15:12.792
There's nothing to say.
At the end of the day, Kim's right.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.125
I know you're mad, but--

15:15.125 --> 15:17.917
Wait, did you just say she's right?

15:18.041 --> 15:19.083
Yeah.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.709
It's all cool, because...

15:23.166 --> 15:25.875
I think I found a way for everyone
to get what they want.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.625
- You ready for the final test?
- Uh...

15:28.709 --> 15:31.083
We wanna see how much air
you can get on these boards.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.000
So, just go off the end of the ramp

15:34.083 --> 15:35.583
and land on that concrete slab.

15:35.667 --> 15:38.208
What? Okay, okay, listen.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.083
- I'm not going to--
- Did anyone every tell you

15:40.166 --> 15:42.083
you have a cute smile?

15:43.166 --> 15:44.458
Let's do this. Come on.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.333
Oh, I came as soon as I heard!

15:51.750 --> 15:53.125
I've fought this fight before.

15:54.041 --> 15:56.166
- You have?
Oh, yeah, sister.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.959
Save the whales, I was on the beach.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.709
Save the bald eagle,
I was in the treetops.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.709
I'm all about respecting life.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.125
- Hold on! Whack-a-mole!
-

16:08.208 --> 16:09.500
That's what we're protecting!

16:10.125 --> 16:12.625
We just have to make sure
that Randy and his friends don't get to it

16:12.709 --> 16:14.375
before the inspector sees it tomorrow.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.125
Forget this. I'm out of here.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.417
Uh, who am I kidding? It's Friday night.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.000
I've got nothing else going on.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.125
Jack, we've been through this.
I know we disagree,

16:26.208 --> 16:28.875
- but I'm not backing off.
- Well, you don't have to.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.542
I spoke to Luke, and he had a great idea.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.917
He's agreed to pay to have it relocated
to a preserve in Oregon

16:35.000 --> 16:36.583
where voles are protected.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.083
I don't know. This is its home.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.542
But Luke said it'll have
a better home in Oregon.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.667
Kim, we all wanted the skatepark.

16:44.875 --> 16:47.750
This is a way to get the park
and give the vole a better life.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.375
It's a win-win. Trust me.

16:52.667 --> 16:53.917
What the-- what?

16:54.041 --> 16:56.583
That's the sound the vole makes
when it's looking for a mate.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.959
Interesting.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.208
Oh, my.

17:09.458 --> 17:12.500
Joan, I wouldn't go over there.
That sounded like a bear.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.000
Oh, that's no bear.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.917
That's Lenny from the bowling alley.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.625
That was a killer nap.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.417
Yo, so I made up a story
about a preserve in Oregon.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.500
Jack and his stupid friends
are on their way here to give us the vole.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.000
What are we gonna do with the vole?

17:34.792 --> 17:36.834
Well, after they leave,
we're going to get rid of it...

17:36.917 --> 17:38.834
- Oh.
- ...permanently.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.625
-
<i>Right on.</i>

17:42.083 --> 17:44.834
- Yo.
- Hey, there they are.

17:45.291 --> 17:47.542
Oh, let me see him. Hey there, little guy.

17:47.625 --> 17:50.250
What's going on? Oh, wow, he's a cute one.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.125
I can see why you want to protect him.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.750
Hey, but don't worry. Where he's going,

17:53.834 --> 17:55.375
he's not gonna have
to worry about anything.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.458
-
- Hold that vole!

17:58.291 --> 18:00.166
Uh, what's going on, Rudy?

18:00.500 --> 18:01.542
I heard everything.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.333
The second you guys leave,
Luke's gonna kill it!

18:04.750 --> 18:07.333
What? You-- you lied to me?

18:08.667 --> 18:10.250
You said you were gonna protect it.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.166
"You said you were gonna protect it."

18:12.250 --> 18:14.083
I don't care about your ugly rat.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.750
I care about building skateparks,

18:15.834 --> 18:18.250
so mindless kids like you
will buy my gear.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.959
Now gimme that cage!

18:52.250 --> 18:53.667
Milton, the board!

19:07.333 --> 19:10.000
Luke, I thought you were a loser
in high school,

19:10.083 --> 19:11.834
and you're an even bigger loser now.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.458
I did not know the vole...

19:20.959 --> 19:23.500
but that furry little fella

19:23.583 --> 19:26.333
burrowed his way into my heart

19:26.417 --> 19:28.375
and would not come out.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.583
I'm going to miss him.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.500
Joan, the vole's not dead.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.250
- What?
- We're just returning it to its home.

19:40.291 --> 19:42.041
Forget that, I'm outta here.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.041
Oh, who am I kidding? It's Saturday night.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.834
I've got nothing else going on.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.417
Oh. Coming, Lenny!

19:56.583 --> 19:59.208
Well, this is it.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.166
You've got nothing to worry about.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.291
This land is protected,

20:03.375 --> 20:05.375
and it'll always be your home.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.083
I think it's really cool
that you took a stand here, Kim.

20:13.166 --> 20:15.500
Well, sometimes you gotta look out
for the little guy.

20:15.583 --> 20:16.667
And each other.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.667
I'm sorry I was so excited
by the skatepark

20:19.750 --> 20:21.667
that I let myself get fooled by Luke.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.959
- You were there when I needed you.
-

20:24.583 --> 20:26.375
Wasn't Rudy gonna say a few words?

20:26.458 --> 20:27.959
Yeah. Where did he go?

20:28.458 --> 20:31.375
<i>Look at me! I made it to the top!</i>

20:31.458 --> 20:33.792
<i>- I am the king of the wor--
-</i>

20:37.000 --> 20:39.083
-
<i>Ow! Oh!</i>

20:39.166 --> 20:40.917
<i>Someone please call my mother.</i>

20:43.208 --> 20:45.625
See, man? I told you we'd get through it.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.709
This is where all our pain pays off.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.583
Hey, why aren't you smiling?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.291
I can't. I broke my face bone.

20:54.959 --> 20:58.709
Wow. That last test really got you, huh?

20:58.792 --> 21:01.709
You guys were the bravest
crash-test dummies we've ever had.

21:01.792 --> 21:06.208
So, uh, would you guys consider going out
with these two brave dummies?

21:06.291 --> 21:08.000
Sure, let us get our Jackets.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.041
Did you hear that?

21:11.125 --> 21:12.333
We're in, bro.

21:12.417 --> 21:15.709
You can't see, but I'm smiling
from ear to ear.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.166
- Yes!
- Yeah!

21:18.250 --> 21:21.041
Whoa!

21:30.750 --> 21:32.500
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>
