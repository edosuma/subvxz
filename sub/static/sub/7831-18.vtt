Mom, I don't want to
play with Ralph.

"Do the message!"
## [Humming]

12:58.077 --> 13:00.545
So long.
I'm gonna sleep over at Ralph's.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.774
Oh! See, I knew you'd find something
you liked about him.

13:03.883 --> 13:06.010
Oh, I found something, all right.

## [Humming Continues]

13:11.924 --> 13:13.892
- After the beep.
- [Beeps]

13:17.163 --> 13:20.030
Uh, Ralph's a little afraid
of the dark, Bart.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.862
- Is it okay to sleep with a night-light?
- Absolutely.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.499
Good night, guys.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.970
- I'm scared.
- Ow!

13:32.344 --> 13:35.973
<i>[Man On TV] We now return to</i>
The Return of the Pink Panther Returns...

The world is our toy store.

Toy store, toy store, toy store!
Whee!

14:14.386 --> 14:16.286
Oh, to be eight again.

14:16.388 --> 14:20.051
Whee!

14:28.200 --> 14:31.226
- Whoa! Whoa!

14:31.337 --> 14:34.363
[Laughing]
Whoa! [Grunts]

14:35.808 --> 14:39.608
Ah, I can't believe
we ate a whole wedding cake.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.976
And an entire pan of funeral fudge.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.547
[Gasps]

14:45.651 --> 14:48.518
Check it out, guys.
It's dork and dorker.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.920
What you doir there, Simpson,
babysittir?

14:52.024 --> 14:53.821
We're on a playdate.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.394
- [Laughing]
- Isn't that adorable?

14:56.495 --> 14:58.759
Ah, the girls are on a playdate!

14:58.864 --> 15:01.833
Uh- I'll take it from here, Ralph.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.903
Um, we're just hangir, chillir,
little bit of illir.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.972
I don't get you, Simpson.

15:07.072 --> 15:11.600
Sometimes you seem kind of righteous, but then
we see you fraternizing with lameoids.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.769
Which makes you a lame wad!

15:13.879 --> 15:17.872
Oh, yeah? Would a lame wad
have the police master key?

15:17.983 --> 15:21.350
- Whoa! Useful, dude!
- Very handy!

15:21.453 --> 15:24.911
Hey, maybe you are cool enough
to hang out with us.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.151
Really? You think so?

15:27.259 --> 15:30.285
I don't know what to say.
This is all happening so fast.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.523
Let's use this thing to rob the school.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.861
Let's go to the zoo and tease the dingo.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.162
Let's use it to key some cars.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.703
Those are all moderately cool ideas...

15:39.805 --> 15:42.273
but if you really want to
walk on the wild side...

15:42.374 --> 15:44.274
I know just the place.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.807
<i>Here she is- the big house.</i>

15:49.915 --> 15:53.544
The stony lonesome.
The thug jug. The mobster trap.

15:53.652 --> 15:56.120
- Penn State. The old crook-
- Shut up!

15:56.221 --> 15:59.019
Let's just open the gate.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.582
- <i>[Dog Howling]</i>
- I'm scared, Bart. I wanna go home.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.425
Come on, Ralph.
Don't embarrass me.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.499
It's just an abandoned prison.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.567
All the murderers are long dead.

16:09.668 --> 16:12.637
And I'm sure their ghosts
are probably in hell.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.230
- [Whimpering]
- Let's go, Simpson! Ditch the baby.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.640
[Whimpers, Gasps]

16:18.744 --> 16:21.508
<i>[Sniffling]</i>

16:25.818 --> 16:29.379
- My key!
- Sorry, Ralph.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.922
I thought we were friends.

16:32.024 --> 16:35.323
[Laughing] Wait. I missed that.
Get him to say it again.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.332
Go on home, Ralph.

16:42.434 --> 16:47.235
[Sobs] I can't, without Daddy's key!
[Gasps]

16:48.607 --> 16:51.405
I can't bail on a friend,
even if it is Ralph.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.638
- Ah, you wuss.
- Hey! Give it back!

16:55.748 --> 16:59.081
- [Grunts]
- Hey! Keep away!

17:00.853 --> 17:03.413
Hey, come on!
I thought we were friends.

17:03.522 --> 17:07.424
Yeah, well, I hope the irony's
not lost on you, Simpson.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.221

[Grunts]

17:11.696 --> 17:13.665
[Laughing]

17:13.766 --> 17:15.733
This sucks.
Let's do somethir else.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.564
I know.
Let's go pick some huckleberries!

17:18.670 --> 17:21.069
- Yeah!
- Huckleberries! All right!

17:21.173 --> 17:23.300
Daddy's key went in there.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.277
Hey, Ralph, you're braver
than you thought.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.279

17:39.291 --> 17:41.555
Wow! Look at all these toilets.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.754
And just inches from your bed.
Talk about luxury.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.956
There's the key!

17:48.834 --> 17:50.734
- [Squeaking]
- [Gasps]

17:50.836 --> 17:54.033
The pointy kitty took it!

17:59.411 --> 18:01.311
Oh.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.971
Danger, eh?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.050
<i>[Key Turning In Lock]</i>

Whoa, mama! The electric chair!

18:13.092 --> 18:16.994
[Sniffs] Smell that, Ralph?
That's the smell of justice.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.064
Smells like hot dogs.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.132
Hmm. Maybe it still works.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.259
Give me the newlyweds
from that cake.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.394
Stand back.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.906
[Grunting, Sighs]
What a gyp.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.374
Maybe our key fits in here.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.890
[Panting]

18:48.994 --> 18:51.792
Why do I always shout first?

18:51.897 --> 18:54.195
Just gives them a chance to run away.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.199
Well, I'm an idiot.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.238
- Got any threes?
- Go fish.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.741
Oh! See, here's the problem, Ralph.

19:04.843 --> 19:08.074
- You have several threes.
- Go fish!

19:08.180 --> 19:10.410
Why don't we watch can'toons?

19:10.516 --> 19:13.314
TheJustice League is moving
into their new building today.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.854
Kent Brockman reporting live
from Mayor Quimby's press conference...

19:16.955 --> 19:18.946
at the abandoned penitentiary.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.991
Huh?

19:21.093 --> 19:25.189
I have ordered the reopening of this prison to
send a message to the criminals of Springfield.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.959
If you commit
a violent crime in my town...

19:28.066 --> 19:30.728
you are going to end up here.

Hey, that's our play chair!

19:32.871 --> 19:35.169
To demonstrate what you're in for...

19:35.274 --> 19:38.141
I will now strap myself
into this electric chair...

19:38.243 --> 19:41.212
which was deactivated
over 30 years ago...

19:41.313 --> 19:43.406
and, I can only assume, still is.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.516
Uh-oh.
We didn't reset the safety switch.

19:44.516 --> 19:44.982
Uh-oh.
We didn't reset the safety switch.

He's gonna smell like hot dogs.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.293

- Operator, get me Morningwood Penitentiary.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.328
- It's an emergency.
- [Busy Signal]

Now, Martha, we've been
over this and over this.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.697
We're too old to start having children.

20:02.801 --> 20:06.237
If you're looking for something to do,
why don't you start a new twine ball?

20:06.338 --> 20:08.306
Come on. A mars life is at stake.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.739
We need to get a message
to the prison.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.742
Think. Think!

20:12.844 --> 20:14.812
Lisa's a good thinker.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.946
That's it. Ralph, you're a genius!

20:19.051 --> 20:22.418
Now, as I mime the convulsions
of a condemned criminal...

20:22.521 --> 20:25.820
I remind my staff
not to come to my assistance...

20:25.924 --> 20:29.587
no matter how realistic
my performance may be.

<i>They're getting ready to throw the switch!</i>

20:33.999 --> 20:36.058
Come on, Lisa. Hurry!

20:36.168 --> 20:38.830
Let's just pray this hits the prison.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.531
[Whistling]

20:42.874 --> 20:45.434
- [Gasps] Huh?
- [Gasps]

20:45.544 --> 20:48.172
Smithers,
there's a rocket in my pocket.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.748
You don't have to tell me, sir.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.909
[Grunting]
Turn off the chair.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.112
- Turn off the chair.
- [All Gasping]

20:59.558 --> 21:02.356
"Electric chair is on," eh?

21:02.461 --> 21:07.455
Then the old prison has been
getting free electricity for 30 years.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.466
I'll put a stop to that.

21:12.004 --> 21:16.373
[Grunting, Groaning]

21:16.475 --> 21:20.411
- Yea! Yeah.
- Wow! That was really entertaining.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.503
- How did you make that smoke?
- [Groans]

21:22.614 --> 21:25.082
- Yeah! All right! Whoo!
- All right!

21:25.183 --> 21:27.481
- Way to go, Ralph!
- Ralph?

21:27.586 --> 21:30.054
But the rocket was my idea.

21:30.155 --> 21:33.318
- But asking you was Ralph's idea.
- You're the man, Ralph!

21:33.425 --> 21:35.791
But surely I deserve some credit for-

21:35.894 --> 21:37.589

Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!

21:37.696 --> 21:41.462
Ah, let him have this one, Lise.
