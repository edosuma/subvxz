WEBVTT

00:09.594 --> 00:14.557
<i>NARRATOR". We have already seen
a beauty queen kidnapped.</i>

00:15.725 --> 00:19.062
<i>And an indoor blizzard.</i>

00:19.979 --> 00:24.567
<i>Only one man could keep a cool that cool.</i>

00:25.485 --> 00:29.280
<i>While the Dynamic Duo dynamite a door.</i>

00:30.198 --> 00:34.202
<i>The iceman cometh with a delivery of what?</i>

00:34.410 --> 00:38.248
<i>Green ice? Bribe money?</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:42.669
<i>Anyway, that's what the papers
seem to feel.</i>

00:43.503 --> 00:46.798
<i>But Bruce Wayne
still had the social responsibilities...</i>

00:47.006 --> 00:50.176
<i>...of any average millionaire.</i>

00:50.802 --> 00:55.348
<i>Though there was a surprise guest
at his garden reception.</i>

00:56.140 --> 01:00.478
<i>Several surprising guests, in fact.</i>

01:00.812 --> 01:04.649
<i>And a freezing finale to the affair.</i>

01:05.441 --> 01:08.945
<i>So back to the capes and cowls.</i>

01:09.696 --> 01:13.491
<i>And a stop at the Frosty Freezies Factory...</i>

01:14.367 --> 01:17.620
<i>...where Robin tangled with a freeze gun.</i>

01:18.496 --> 01:23.710
<i>And the Dynamic Duo found themselves
with a choice of very frosty flavors.</i>

01:25.169 --> 01:28.089
<i>Fooled, framed and frozen.</i>

01:28.298 --> 01:31.050
<i>Frosty Freezies instead of crime-fighters.</i>

01:31.259 --> 01:33.678
<i>What now? What next?</i>

02:53.549 --> 02:57.887
We have been in some pretty tight fixes, but
I don't see how we're gonna get out of this one.

02:58.096 --> 03:02.058
Yes, this is quite a predicament, old chum.

03:02.266 --> 03:06.229
But remember, in the end,
right always triumphs.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.774
If it does, I'm going to spend
the rest of my life in a Turkish bath.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.193
A Turkish bath.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.195
You've hit it, Robin.

03:14.404 --> 03:20.702
The steam in the pipes of most Turkish baths
is superheated moisture.

03:20.910 --> 03:24.789
Remove the heat,
and the moisture turns to frost.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.916
Do you feel anything around your feet?

03:27.125 --> 03:28.918
Yeah, chilblains.

03:29.961 --> 03:33.089
No, no, something mechanical.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.843
Some kind of valve or a blower.

03:37.051 --> 03:41.681
Something that might inject
the flavoring or the coloring...

03:41.889 --> 03:44.308
...or the freezing components.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.060
I don't know, Batman.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.396
I think there's a little spigot or something.

03:48.604 --> 03:49.731
In mine too.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.691
It might be the heat exhaust valve.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.403
If we can just get our feet
to do the work for our fingers...

03:55.611 --> 03:59.031
...and recycle the exhaust in the heating unit
of the containers...

03:59.240 --> 04:03.244
...we might reverse the process
of refrigeration...

04:03.453 --> 04:07.165
...and the heat transfer will melt our way out.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.089
Too bad, too bad.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.551
Perhaps I shouldn't have disposed
of Batman and Robin.

04:18.760 --> 04:19.969
At least not so soon.

04:20.136 --> 04:22.513
Then I could have toyed with them
a little longer...

04:22.722 --> 04:26.642
...and destroyed their saintly image
slower but more effective.

04:26.851 --> 04:27.935
I have an idea.

04:28.144 --> 04:31.063
Chill, go and get me the instant camera.

04:31.272 --> 04:35.818
After I'm through with this little business,
I'm going to execute my plan...

04:36.027 --> 04:38.863
...for the greatest ice crime in history...

04:39.071 --> 04:42.617
...that will destroy all of Gotham City
in a few minutes.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.578
And there will be no Batman and Robin
to stop me.

04:45.787 --> 04:49.040
And then, my darling, Miss Iceland...

04:49.248 --> 04:52.835
...your temperature will be down
to my temperature...

04:53.044 --> 04:56.589
...and you will become Mrs. Freeze.

04:56.798 --> 04:57.840
Never.

04:58.049 --> 05:02.011
Not if I live to be a hundred below zero.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.346
I'll never marry you.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.558
Stubborn but beautiful.

05:07.975 --> 05:13.189
This plan is going to be something
really wild, boys.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.565
Wild.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.779
<i>NARRATOR". That wild plan better include
Batman and Robin...</i>

05:19.987 --> 05:23.866
<i>...for even now</i>
a <i>well thawed-out Dynamic Duo...</i>

05:24.075 --> 05:27.328
<i>...race to the Batcave to plot their next move.</i>

05:36.587 --> 05:38.256
An obvious hoax.

05:38.422 --> 05:43.010
Doctoring up the picture
by superimposing his watch on my wrist.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.762
Holy distortion.

05:44.971 --> 05:47.056
Most unsporting of Mr. Freeze, I must say.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.392
Yeah, sure makes you look bad, Batman.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.645
Although the newspaper clearly indicated
that this photograph...

05:52.854 --> 05:54.814
...came from an anonymous source...

05:55.022 --> 05:57.441
...and that quite possibly it might be a fake...

05:57.608 --> 06:01.904
...the great majority of the people will only look
at the photograph and not read the text.

06:02.113 --> 06:04.073
An unfortunate failing of the masses, sir.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.158
What do we do now?

06:06.534 --> 06:10.329
The only thing we can do, Robin.

06:11.581 --> 06:14.083
Hang up our capes and cowls.

06:14.292 --> 06:16.335
Oh, no, sir, not that.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.880
I'm afraid so, Alfred.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.382
With all this adverse publicity...

06:21.591 --> 06:26.095
...it might be well
to let the people think what they will...

06:26.304 --> 06:30.141
...that we've taken a runout powder.

06:30.349 --> 06:34.729
That way, maybe we can lull Mr. Freeze
into a false sense of security...

06:34.937 --> 06:36.898
...make him overplay his hand.

06:37.106 --> 06:41.652
After all, I'm sure he believes
that we're Frosty Freezies by now.

06:41.861 --> 06:44.030
You were most ingenious
in preventing that, sir.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.450
Thank you, Alfred.
But it will take more ingenuity...

06:47.658 --> 06:53.623
...to get us back in the good graces
of the good people of Gotham City.

06:54.540 --> 06:58.794
Aunt Harriet asked us to
go into the city on an errand...

06:59.003 --> 07:02.673
...as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson,
remember'?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.258
Mm.

07:20.066 --> 07:23.110
Nellie, gentlemen,
please, please, one at a time.

07:23.319 --> 07:25.905
Are you going to prefer bribery charges
against them...

07:26.113 --> 07:28.574
...or is the Dynamic Duo exempt
from the law?

07:28.783 --> 07:30.284
Nellie, I resent that innuendo.

07:30.493 --> 07:34.330
Nobody is exempt from the law. Batman
would be the first to say so if he were here.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.040
But he isn't, commissioner...

07:36.248 --> 07:39.335
...nor has he shown his masked face
around Gotham City...

07:39.543 --> 07:41.921
...since that grandstand play
at Wayne Manor.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.758
Now, I'm sorry, I simply don't
have any more time. Chief.

07:46.092 --> 07:47.843
No, you don't have time.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.637
At least not wristwatch time.

07:52.390 --> 07:54.809
Maybe you'd better ask Batman
the time of day.

07:55.017 --> 07:58.688
-Isn't he the one wearing your watch?
-All right. Nellie, and the rest of you...

07:58.896 --> 08:02.316
...back to your typewriters
to peck out more of your slanted stories.

08:02.525 --> 08:03.609
Mother Machree.

08:03.818 --> 08:08.322
But it's a sad state of affairs in Gotham City
when journalism stoops so low.

08:08.531 --> 08:12.034
Too bad. The truth
really hit a nerve root, hasn't it?

08:12.243 --> 08:13.786
Out.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.958
What do you think, commissioner?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.794
I honestly don't know
what to think, Chief O'Hara.

08:22.003 --> 08:25.172
But I do fear for Batman's heroic image.

08:25.381 --> 08:29.301
I have a feeling the terrible tide
of adverse public opinion...

08:29.510 --> 08:32.929
...may soon engulf our Caped Crusader.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.350
Boo, Batman.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.951
Gosh, Bruce, did you hear that?

08:54.160 --> 08:57.204
Nothing has ever cut me so deeply
to the quick.

08:57.413 --> 09:01.250
No blow ever struck by any arch-villain...

09:01.459 --> 09:04.879
...has ever hurt me so acutely...

09:05.087 --> 09:06.964
...as that little boy's boo.

09:08.883 --> 09:12.636
One billion dollars.
One billion dollars, they'll pay me.

09:12.845 --> 09:17.725
And nobody can stop it,
especially not Batman and Robin, eh?

09:17.933 --> 09:22.646
By the way, why don't the newspapers
mention anything about their sad end...

09:22.855 --> 09:25.816
...at the Frosty Freezies Factory?

09:26.025 --> 09:27.902
Maybe nobody has found them yet.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.361
Of course, Chill.

09:29.570 --> 09:33.741
And by the time they find them,
they'll make Freezies for Goliath.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.244
You can't get away with it.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.830
There is still the law.

09:40.039 --> 09:41.624
Good will triumph.

09:41.916 --> 09:45.544
Shh. Don't get excited, darling, Miss Iceland.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.924
I don't want your temperature to rise
even a few degrees.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.301
One billion dollars.

09:52.510 --> 09:54.929
The citizens of Gotham City will pay me...

09:55.137 --> 10:00.392
...or I will bury all of them
under one huge cake of ice...

10:00.601 --> 10:03.312
...exactly like a million years ago.

10:03.521 --> 10:04.688
Wild.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.819
Wild. Utterly Wild.

10:10.361 --> 10:12.321
Preposterous.

10:12.530 --> 10:16.492
Utterly and fantastically preposterous.

10:16.742 --> 10:21.997
Mr. Freeze has finally gone too far,
demanding $1 billion...

10:22.206 --> 10:24.959
...by threatening to completely cover
Gotham City with ice.

10:26.544 --> 10:27.711
In August?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.255
August or December...

10:29.463 --> 10:32.466
...I wouldn't take Mr. Freeze's threat
too lightly, commissioner.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.427
With all due respect, Mr. Wayne...

10:35.636 --> 10:38.722
...you don't think that Mr. Freeze
could really do such a thing.

10:38.931 --> 10:44.103
I mean, I think he would do it if he could,
but I don't think he can, can he?

10:44.562 --> 10:49.275
- Don't underestimate his power, Chief O'Hara.
-Look what he did the other night at the party...

10:49.483 --> 10:51.485
...when he instantly froze us in the pool.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.823
But could he freeze a whole metropolis
the size of Gotham City?

10:56.031 --> 10:58.450
May I see his blackmail note,
commissioner?

10:58.868 --> 11:00.327
Uh, yeah, surely.

11:03.956 --> 11:07.209
"One billion dollars
by high noon tomorrow or..."

11:07.418 --> 11:09.837
Et cetera, et cetera.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.966
"And if you do not believe me,
try turning on your water faucets...

11:14.175 --> 11:16.051
...at 2:00 this afternoon."

11:16.260 --> 11:18.429
- Two o'clock?
-Two o'clock.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.560
Beg your pardon, chief, but the switchboard
is lit up like a Christmas tree.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.563
- Everybody is complaining.
-About what, sergeant?

11:27.771 --> 11:29.023
The water, sir.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.483
Nobody can get any water
through their faucet.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.445
- Did you check with the water department?
-Yes, sir.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.739
But if you don't mind me saying so...

11:36.947 --> 11:40.159
...I think they must be nipping a bit over there
at the waterworks.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.162
<i>- Do you know</i> what <i>they said?
- The hottest day of the year...</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:46.957
<i>...and they said the water reservoir
in Gotham City Park is frozen solid...</i>

11:47.166 --> 11:50.586
<i>...which it never has been before,
even on the coldest day of the year.</i>

11:50.794 --> 11:53.797
<i>The newsmen learned
of the diabolical scheme of Mr. Freeze...</i>

11:54.006 --> 11:56.175
<i>...to completely cover Gotham City with ice...</i>

11:56.383 --> 11:59.470
<i>...unless $1 billion is paid to him
before high noon tomorrow.</i>

11:59.803 --> 12:02.181
<i>Since the announcement
less than two hours ago...</i>

12:02.389 --> 12:03.807
<i>...panic has hit the streets.</i>

12:04.016 --> 12:06.852
<i>Motorists have jammed the highways
leading out of Gotham City.</i>

12:07.061 --> 12:10.397
<i>Traffic through the Gotham City Tunnel
is blocked for three miles.</i>

12:11.023 --> 12:14.443
<i>This afternoon,
everything is complete chaos.</i>

12:14.652 --> 12:16.487
<i>Terror reigns--</i>

12:16.695 --> 12:20.449
With $1 billion,
I'm going to go to Switzerland.

12:20.658 --> 12:25.913
And I will take you, darling,
Miss Iceland, with me as my bride.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.208
I wouldn't marry you for $10 billion.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.543
You wouldn't?

12:31.794 --> 12:34.421
No wonder you haven't changed your mind.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.925
This thing is not working
as well as it should.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.843
I'll tell you What I'll do.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.595
In the morning...

12:41.804 --> 12:47.226
...I will freeze your beautiful body solid.

12:48.477 --> 12:49.937
Oh!

12:50.104 --> 12:52.648
You diabolical beast.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.985
Wild.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.489
<i>Panic is rampant
throughout the long and terrible night.</i>

13:00.698 --> 13:03.325
<i>Reports have come in
of hysterical children everywhere.</i>

13:03.534 --> 13:04.785
<i>Awakening and screaming:</i>

13:04.994 --> 13:08.163
<i>"Mama, Mama, Mama,
don't let the ice cover me, please."</i>

13:08.372 --> 13:12.710
We've been up all night listening to this.

13:13.294 --> 13:17.506
Aunt Harriet, surely you and Alfred
need some sleep.

13:17.715 --> 13:21.677
Of course, Bruce, we all do.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.096
I think Dick and I will take a little walk...

13:24.305 --> 13:28.058
...get some of the frozen cobwebs
out of our brain.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.894
- Good idea, Bruce.
-Let's go, Dick.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.564
Poor Bruce.

13:33.772 --> 13:38.944
That horrible Mr. Freeze's threats
have upset him greatly.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.697
Heaven knows what will happen today.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.782
Why don't you go up to your room, madam?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.118
Thank you, Alfred.

13:46.327 --> 13:48.579
<i>Another blazing day in Gotham City...</i>

13:48.787 --> 13:51.540
<i>...with our citizens knowing only too well
that by noon...</i>

13:51.749 --> 13:54.626
<i>...they may be freezing to death
in subzero temperatures...</i>

13:54.835 --> 13:58.630
<i>...unless, of course, city officials can raise--</i>

13:58.839 --> 14:00.299
Why turn them off?

14:00.799 --> 14:05.179
I know the end of that sentence by heart.
"One billion dollars."

14:05.387 --> 14:07.348
But it's impossible.

14:07.556 --> 14:11.518
Even if we were to mortgage
every public building, every city-owned utility...

14:11.727 --> 14:15.564
...we couldn't get a loan for that amount
of money in such a short space of time.

14:15.773 --> 14:19.193
Do you suppose there's a possibility
Mr. Freeze could be bluffing?

14:19.401 --> 14:23.280
Well, what would he hope to gain
by burying Gotham City under all that ice?

14:23.489 --> 14:25.949
Bluffing, never.

14:26.283 --> 14:30.454
As for what he could gain, revenge.

14:30.662 --> 14:34.249
Revenge for being forced to live away
from society.

14:34.458 --> 14:39.296
Alone in his own torturous world
of subzero temperature.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.048
What can we do, commissioner?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.133
Do?

14:43.425 --> 14:48.764
I honestly don't know, Mayor Linseed.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.809
If only...

14:52.935 --> 14:54.144
Go ahead, commissioner.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.021
Call Batman and Robin.

14:56.230 --> 14:59.983
If Gotham City ever needed them,
she needs them now.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.406
I never thought it would happen.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.992
But like so many others, l...

15:10.160 --> 15:15.666
I'm afraid I've lost faith.

15:34.268 --> 15:35.811
Atomic batteries to power.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.605
- Turbines to speed.
-Roger. Ready to move out.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.918
Why the change of heart, Batman?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.713
Tarnished reputations
are unfortunate, Robin.

16:02.921 --> 16:06.925
We can live with those. However,
a threat to all of Gotham City is something else.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.594
He's in that cold storage plant.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.764
He and his stooges made an appearance at
the Frosty Freezies Factory around the corner.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.517
- Then we go?
-We go.

16:41.210 --> 16:44.171
This should put a crank in his channel.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.883
What's the matter?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.719
First the commentator said
the stock market went kaput...

16:50.886 --> 16:52.429
...and now the TV set went kaput.

16:52.638 --> 16:55.933
- Must be the antenna went on the blink.
-Frosty, go and fix it.

16:56.099 --> 17:00.437
How else would I know whether I get the billion
dollars or I have to destroy Gotham City?

17:04.733 --> 17:07.319
That should straighten your antennae.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.951
Mr. Freeze, I believe.

17:14.159 --> 17:18.789
Batman. But you were supposed
to be a famous Frosty Freezie by now.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.832
Exactly what we wanted you to believe.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.042
- Robin.
- Wait.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.461
Look there.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.880
Batman.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.966
Why, you beast.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.176
You sinful beast.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.762
You're inhuman. An absolute demon.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.057
Inhuman? Demon? Wild.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.644
Why don't you join me
in my frozen frigid world?

17:40.852 --> 17:44.439
Perhaps you would like to be
our best icemen at the wedding.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.024
You and Robin.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.693
Boys.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.847
Wild. Simply Wild.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.432
Holy chicken coop.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.019
And a nice cold chicken coop,
Boy Wonder.

18:22.227 --> 18:28.358
I've just one telephone call to make
and then I'll finish you off forever.

18:28.692 --> 18:32.863
It was a good idea of yours
to wear our Bat-thermal underwear.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.659
I think your idea is the one
that will save us, Robin.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.958
Commissioner Gordon speaking.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.252
<i>This is Mr. Freeze speaking.</i>

18:47.461 --> 18:49.129
It's he.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.631
<i>Are you listening?</i>

18:50.839 --> 18:53.842
Yes, we're listening.
What's your proposition?

18:54.051 --> 18:58.221
You know my proposition. One billion dollars
by noon or you'll freeze to death. Simple.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.556
Mr. Freeze, hear me out.

18:59.765 --> 19:03.101
We can't raise $1 billion in such a short time,
do you understand?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.354
We can't get that much money by noon.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.357
You have exactly 26 minutes, that's all.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.985
Mr. Freeze, give us more time.
We need more time.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.487
Time for what?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.656
To wait for Batman perhaps?

19:15.864 --> 19:18.283
If you are waiting for the Dynamic Duo,
forget it.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.577
They're my prisoners here in my hideout.

19:20.786 --> 19:24.164
And soon they'll be icemen. Real icemen.

19:24.373 --> 19:28.710
One billion dollars in 26 minutes.

19:30.712 --> 19:36.259
Gentlemen, I'm afraid all is lost.

19:38.929 --> 19:41.723
Well, gentlemen, the expression is, I believe:

19:42.099 --> 19:45.811
"Time for the kill.
Curtains for the Caped Crusaders."

19:52.359 --> 19:53.777
What happened?

19:53.985 --> 19:55.779
You're supposed to be frozen.

19:55.987 --> 20:00.075
We took the precaution of processing
our crime-fighting costumes...

20:00.283 --> 20:03.704
...with a special
Bat-Anti-Freeze-Activating solution.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.706
And rubbed some on the rest of our bodies.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.292
And so it's curtains for you,
Mr. Freeze, not for us.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.128
Not as long as you're in that cage.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.297
We brought along another small surprise.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.133
We anticipated trouble here.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.884
And came prepared.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.846
So you have no chance of outwitting us...

20:21.054 --> 20:24.474
...and even less of glaciating Gotham City.
-Is that so?

20:33.692 --> 20:35.068
No.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.867
That should chill their goose for a while.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.412
Now to get that young lady
out of her ice coffin.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.706
- How?
-By a simple method...

21:29.915 --> 21:32.626
...which has become somewhat
old-fashioned: an ice pick.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.897
Oh, Batman, what can I ever do
to thank you?

21:54.105 --> 21:57.275
Thank the judges of the Miss Galaxy
Beauty Contest, Miss Iceland.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.320
They agreed to postpone the final event
until you were found.

22:00.529 --> 22:01.571
How wonderful.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.032
- I'm dying.
- Mr. Freeze.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.201
Go warm yourself.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.085
My...

22:16.461 --> 22:18.922
My freeze collar.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.841
- I'm dying.
-Help me, Robin.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.425
I'm dying.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.970
My freeze collar.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.722
I am dying. I'm dying-

22:31.935 --> 22:36.940
This should keep you alive, Mr. Freeze,
until the police find your ice neckpiece.

22:40.777 --> 22:45.657
Well, that's right, Warden Crichton. You see,
Mr. Freeze is not a normal average prisoner.

22:45.866 --> 22:50.078
He must, at all times, wear his
Jet-freeze collar in order to stay alive.

22:50.287 --> 22:53.707
Anything you can do to lower the temperature
of his cell would be a help.

22:54.583 --> 22:57.419
Thank you. Goodbye.

22:59.170 --> 23:03.216
Your consideration is admirable, Batman,
but Mr. Freeze hardly deserves it.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.636
Hmph. Not that icy-hearted
enemy of the people.

23:06.845 --> 23:11.600
A brother's sufferings
claim a brother's pity, gentlemen.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.019
- Holy epigrams.
-No, Robin.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.396
Truisms. No man is really all bad.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.190
Now, gentlemen, I suggest we take a break.

23:19.524 --> 23:23.194
We have tickets for tonight's finals
in the Gotham City Miss Galaxy Contest.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.780
Robin is a little young
for this sort of thing but--

23:25.989 --> 23:28.658
I'm not gonna be young all my life,
Batman, and besides, uh...

23:28.825 --> 23:31.786
...beauty contests are practically
an American institution.

23:31.995 --> 23:38.585
You see, gentlemen,
such pure logic is indisputable.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.881
Hello there, young man.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.799
I know you were up here, Batman.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.260
I saw the Batmobile downstairs.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.804
Let's take an elevator ride.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.226
Gee, Batman, you're the greatest.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.817
False pride is indeed
a dangerous thing, Chief O'Hara.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.820
False pride?
We were talking about beauty contests.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.656
I'm talking about myself.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.408
How hard it is to admit when I'm wrong.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.160
But I was wrong...

24:12.369 --> 24:14.454
...so wrong...

24:14.704 --> 24:21.002
...when I ever even imagined
I was losing my faith in Batman.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.091
<i>NARRATOR".
Next week, rematch.</i>
