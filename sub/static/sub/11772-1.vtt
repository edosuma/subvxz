( theme music playing )

00:13.733 --> 00:15.733
( classical music
playing )

00:31.467 --> 00:33.133

00:35.600 --> 00:38.033

01:24.367 --> 01:25.833
Larry:
I'M DROWNING.

01:25.867 --> 01:27.167
I'M GONNA DIE.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.600
AND SOMEWHERE--
I'M NOT RELIGIOUS AT ALL--

01:29.633 --> 01:31.400
I SAID, "GOD, HELP ME!"

01:31.433 --> 01:34.933
AND I'M DEPOSITED
RIGHT ON THE BEACH.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.533
- Woman: OH MY GOLLY.
- I WENT SWIMMING THAT DAY
FOR SOME REASON.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.333
SOMETHING DREW ME
TO THE WATER.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.067
WHY? I DON'T KNOW.

01:42.100 --> 01:45.233
I WAS LIKE A BABY
DRAWN TO THE NIPPLE.

01:45.267 --> 01:48.767
YOU KNOW?
OR AN ADULT DRAWN
TO THE NIPPLE.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.067
- ( people chuckle )
- EITHER WAY, RIGHT?

01:50.100 --> 01:52.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
- IS THAT DIVINE
INTERVENTION?

01:52.200 --> 01:55.067
- Man: UNBELIEVABLE.
- IS THAT NOT DIVINE
INTERVENTION?

01:55.067 --> 01:57.067
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
- HUH?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.600
- I THINK THIS HAPPENED
FOR A REASON.
- YES!

01:58.633 --> 02:02.367
YES, I THINK SO TOO.
IT HAPPENED FOR A REASON.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.300
MAYBE YOU'LL START
TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL
TO PEOPLE,

02:05.333 --> 02:07.733
- TREAT PEOPLE BETTER.
- I'M RESPECTFUL TO PEOPLE.

02:07.767 --> 02:10.233
- EH, LARRY, EH-HEH.
- WHAT? "EH-HEH"?

02:10.267 --> 02:12.400
- FINE. WHATEVER.
- I RESPECT TO PEOPLE.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.167
- I'M VERY NICE TO PEOPLE.
- YEAH, FINE.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.700
SO, ANYWAY, HUH?
AMAZING?

02:16.733 --> 02:17.967
- IS THAT AMAZING?
- Jeff: AWESOME.

02:18.067 --> 02:20.267
TRUE STORY,

02:20.300 --> 02:23.200
TO LIFE! L'CHAIM!

02:23.233 --> 02:25.967
- YEAH!
- TO LIFE!

02:26.067 --> 02:27.567
Woman: EVERY DAY IS A GIFT.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.433
ARE YOU GOING
TO TEMPLE FOR
THE HIGH HOLY DAYS?

02:33.467 --> 02:34.900
- OF COURSE.
- I WANT TO GO
TO TEMPLE THIS YEAR.

02:34.933 --> 02:36.300
- YOU DO?
- WELL, YEAH.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.933
GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED,
DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD?

02:38.967 --> 02:40.167
YEAH, IT'S A GREAT THING,
BUT YOU'VE GOT

02:40.200 --> 02:43.267
TO GET YOUR TICKET
SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.533
IT'S A TOUGH TICKET
TO GO TO HIGH HOLY DAYS.

02:44.567 --> 02:46.900
WHY DO YOU NEED A TICKET
TO GO TO TEMPLE?
IT'S CRAZY!

02:46.933 --> 02:49.200
I'M NOT SAYING
I JUSTIFY IT,

02:49.233 --> 02:51.667
BUT YOU NEED A TICKET,
AND I'VE GOT MY TICKETS.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.133
HOW AM I GONNA GET ONE?

02:53.167 --> 02:55.867
UM...

02:55.900 --> 02:58.800
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS,

02:58.833 --> 03:00.733
AND IF I HOOK ONE UP
I CALL YOU TONIGHT.

03:00.767 --> 03:02.833
- OKAY.
- WE'LL SEE.

03:02.867 --> 03:04.433
LOOK AT THIS THING.

03:04.467 --> 03:07.133
YOU EVER SEE A HANDLE
LIKE THIS ON A CUP?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

03:07.167 --> 03:09.500
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A PRETEND TEACUP.
- LOOK.

03:09.533 --> 03:11.467
YOU CAN'T GET
YOUR INDEX FINGER IN THERE.
WHAT'S THE POINT?

03:11.500 --> 03:13.667
I LIKE WATCHING YOU
DO THAT.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.667
THERE WAS SOMETHING I WANT
TO TELL YOU-- OH!

03:16.700 --> 03:18.433
I WENT BY LEO'S
DELICATESSEN.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.667

03:24.733 --> 03:25.867
SWEAR TO GOD.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.367
LEO NAMED

YOU'RE KIDDING!

03:27.400 --> 03:31.200
- YEP YEP YEP.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.600
YOU'RE ON THE BOARD.

03:32.633 --> 03:35.867

03:56.500 --> 03:58.233
OH MY GOSH.

03:58.267 --> 04:00.833
( whispers )
HE BUMPED ME.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.933
- DID YOU BUMP INTO HIM?
- NO.

04:02.967 --> 04:04.100
YOU BUMPED INTO ME.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.700
- YOU DIDN'T BUMP INTO ME?
- LARR, PLEASE.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.633

- OH, NOTHING.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.367

04:30.300 --> 04:31.567
WE'RE NOT READY

04:31.600 --> 04:33.367
- HE JUST GOT HIS FOOD.
- YOU'LL GET A RIDE.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.600
- IF DON'T GET A RIDE
GIVE ME A CALL.
- FINE!

04:36.633 --> 04:38.433
- YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM US.
- YEAH, YOU'LL COME BACK
AND GET US.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.467

04:41.767 --> 04:43.300
( Cheryl moaning )

04:43.333 --> 04:45.200
Cheryl:

04:45.233 --> 04:48.067
Larry:

04:48.067 --> 04:50.433
OOH, LARRY.

04:54.067 --> 04:56.133
( phone ringing )

04:57.667 --> 05:00.733
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.600
ACTUALLY, THAT MIGHT
BE JEFF CALLING ABOUT
THE TEMPLE TICKETS.

05:02.633 --> 05:05.367
- I DON'T CARE.
- HUH?

05:05.400 --> 05:08.067
- I DON'T CARE.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.633
HE'LL CALL BACK.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.733
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
TO TRY AND FIND OUT.
HELLO?

05:12.767 --> 05:14.833

05:19.733 --> 05:21.233
I'M SORRY,

YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY
FOR A SCALPER.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.133
REALLY? THEY GOT
SCALPER TICKETS?

05:25.167 --> 05:26.833

05:49.667 --> 05:51.633
WHAT?

05:51.667 --> 05:53.500
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
WHAT?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.900
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO ANSWER THE PHONE?

05:55.933 --> 05:57.600
'CAUSE I TOLD YOU
I WAS EXPECTING A CALL.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.233
WHY? SO WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

05:59.267 --> 06:01.833
JESUS.

06:01.867 --> 06:03.233
GOOD NIGHT.

06:03.267 --> 06:05.233
OH, RIGHT.

06:05.267 --> 06:07.233
MUSTN'T INTERRUPT
INTERCOURSE.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.533
OH, SACRED INTERCOURSE
CANNOT BE INTERRUPTED.

06:10.567 --> 06:13.467
OH, EVERYBODY QUIET.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.067
QUIET FOR INTERCOURSE.

06:15.067 --> 06:18.067
SHH! DON'T DISTURB
THE INTERCOURSE.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.433
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.067
THIS IS SOME KIND
OF SANDWICH, MY FRIEND.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.400
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I REALLY KVELLED--

06:28.433 --> 06:30.233
REALLY SWELLED UP
WITH JOY.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.067
LOOK AT THAT.
LARRY DAVID SANDWICH.

06:32.067 --> 06:34.733
I REALLY KVELL
FROM THIS.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.733
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
MAKES ME PROUDER
THAN ANYTHING.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.633
AH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE IT.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.067

06:47.500 --> 06:50.467
- YOU DO A LOT
OF MUMBLING.
- OKAY.

06:50.500 --> 06:54.700
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF RESPECT FOR SPEECH.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.800
YOU COULD SPEAK
A LITTLE CLEARER.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.333
IT WOULDN'T HURT ANYBODY.
YOU'RE LAUGHING IN MY FACE.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.467
I DON'T HAVE RESPECT
FOR SPEECH?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.900
- YES, SIR.
- I DO! I RESPECT SPEECH!

07:03.933 --> 07:05.367
- YES!

07:05.400 --> 07:07.800

07:25.633 --> 07:28.467

ON THE BOARD--

07:28.500 --> 07:30.067
HAVING MY OWN SANDWICH!

07:30.067 --> 07:31.600
( laughs )

07:31.633 --> 07:34.533
LARRY DAVID SANDWICH,
HUH?

07:34.567 --> 07:36.833

07:48.833 --> 07:50.467
YOU KNOW...

07:50.500 --> 07:52.067
I'M NOT REALLY A BIG--

07:52.067 --> 07:54.467
I'M NOT REALLY A BIG FISH GUY
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.800
THIS IS THE BEST WHITEFISH
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.867
NO OTHER PLACE GOT
THIS WHITEFISH BUT ME.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.933
I'M SURE IT IS,
BUT I'M MORE OF A PASTRAMI,
CORNED BEEF KIND OF GUY.

08:03.967 --> 08:06.133
CAN I GET A PASTRAMI,
CORNED BEEF THING?

08:06.167 --> 08:09.600
YOU ARE
THE WHITEFISH-SABLE
PERIOD.

08:09.633 --> 08:11.533
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- WHAT ABOUT TONGUE?

08:11.567 --> 08:14.300
NO TONGUE!

08:14.333 --> 08:16.167
HEY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
OKAY?

08:16.200 --> 08:19.633
WHAT IF I GOT SOMEBODY

08:19.667 --> 08:20.967
TO SWITCH SANDWICHES
WITH ME?

08:21.067 --> 08:23.800
- TO SWITCH WITH YOU?
- YEAH, MAYBE, YOU KNOW...

08:23.833 --> 08:27.167
UH, TED DANSON,
OR SOMETHING.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.433
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.633
OKAY, I TELL YOU WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO FOR YOU.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.067
IF THE MR. DANSON SAY OKAY,

08:34.100 --> 08:35.333
OKAY, THEN SWITCH.

08:35.367 --> 08:37.667
- OKAY.
- IF I CAN DO IT,
I CAN DO IT.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.067
- I'LL SEE YOU
AT TEMPLE.
- OKAY.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.600
JESUS, THAT GUY...

08:44.633 --> 08:47.267
ALMOST BROKE MY HAND
WITH THAT SHAKE.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.433
- DON'T WHISPER TO ME.
- I SAID HE ALMOST

08:49.467 --> 08:51.800
BROKE MY HAND
WITH THAT HANDSHAKE!

08:51.833 --> 08:55.267
YOU KNOW,
MOST OF THE TIME
ONCE IN AWHILE

08:55.300 --> 08:56.800
IF YOU'RE...

08:56.833 --> 08:59.167
IF YOU'RE PLEASANT
TO PEOPLE...

08:59.200 --> 09:01.100
( stammering )
YOU... YOU...

09:03.967 --> 09:06.067
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- ( choking )

09:06.067 --> 09:09.067
- TAKE A DRINK OF WATER.
- ( gasps )

09:09.067 --> 09:10.867
TAKE SOME WATER.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.700
( dispatch radio squawks )

09:15.733 --> 09:17.367
IT'S OKAY, POP.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.333
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.067
I'VE GOT YOUR GLASSES.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.400
Doctor: WELL, YOUR DAD HASHAD A
MILD STROKE.

09:40.433 --> 09:43.500
- REALLY?
- YES. HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.933
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
I'VE GOT HIM LIGHTLY
SEDATED

09:45.967 --> 09:47.800
AND HE'S RESTING.

09:47.833 --> 09:50.800
HE'S DOING VERY WELL
AND IT'S NOTHING FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.767
- OKAY.
- ABSOLUTELY.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.700
MY FEELING IS WE MAY DO
A LITTLE CORRECTIVE SURGERY.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.700
I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHEN,

09:57.733 --> 10:00.100
BUT WE'LL HAVE HIM HERE
FOR AWHILE.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.067
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.733
MY DAD AND I WERE
EATING IN THE DELI...

10:04.767 --> 10:07.800
- MM-HMM.
- EARLIER, AND UM--

10:07.833 --> 10:10.900
ACTUALLY, THEY NAMED
A SANDWICH AFTER ME.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.967
- NO KIDDING?
- I'VE GOT MY OWN SANDWICH.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.100
- THAT IS GREAT.
- I'M UP ON THE BOARD.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.700
THE LARRY DAVID.
IF YOU GO IN THERE--

10:17.733 --> 10:21.567
I'VE SEE THAT ON THE MENU--
EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR SANDWICH.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.300
BUT THE BAD NEWS IS THAT
I CAN STAND THE SANDWICH,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.767
( chuckles )
WHAT IS IT?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.833
I SEE YOU RECOILED.
WAS IT A BREATH THING?

10:28.867 --> 10:32.000
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- I NOTICED YOU PUT
YOUR HEAD BACK.

10:32.033 --> 10:34.700
- BUT ANYWAY,
HERE'S MY QUESTION.
- OKAY.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.200
IS IT POSSIBLE

10:36.233 --> 10:39.433
THAT THE SANDWICH

10:39.467 --> 10:42.633
COULD'VE HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE STROKE?

10:42.667 --> 10:45.000
IF THE SANDWICH
WAS CAUGHT...

10:45.033 --> 10:47.000
AND HE STARTED CHOKING
AND COULDN'T BREATHE

10:47.033 --> 10:49.433
AND THEN BECAME FEARFUL,
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.

10:49.467 --> 10:51.367
YOU KNOW, IT COULD RAISE
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.533
HIS LIFE IS NOT THREATENED.
HE'S FINE AND HE'S RESTING.

10:53.567 --> 10:57.100
THE SANDWICH
GAVE HIM A STROKE.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS?

10:57.133 --> 10:59.267
THE SANDWICH.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.967
DO YOU MIND IF I--
IF I, UH--

11:03.067 --> 11:05.133
I'M A BIG FAN
OF "SEINFELD."

11:05.167 --> 11:07.967
- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
BOTHERS YOU OR NOT.
- WHY WOULD IT BOTHER ME?

11:08.067 --> 11:10.600
- IT WAS A WONDERFUL SHOW.
- THANK YOU.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.933
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

11:12.967 --> 11:15.733
I'M GONNA DO YOUR FATHER'S
SURGERY FOR YOU.

11:15.767 --> 11:16.900
I'M CHIEF SURGEON HERE.

11:16.933 --> 11:19.600
USUALLY I DELEGATE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,

11:19.633 --> 11:21.967
BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO DO THIS FOR YOU.

11:22.067 --> 11:25.167
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE A GOLFER, RIGHT?

11:25.200 --> 11:28.433
WOULD LIKE TO GET
TOGETHER AND PLAY?

11:34.867 --> 11:37.067
- ( heart monitor beeping )
- ( sighs )

11:37.067 --> 11:41.067
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT SANDWICH MIGHT HAVE
BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.433
I'M SO SORRY.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.867
WHITEFISH.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.967
WHY DID HE HAVE
TO GIVE ME WHITEFISH?

11:50.067 --> 11:52.933
THERE ARE SO MANY
OTHER SANDWICHES.

11:52.967 --> 11:56.333
PASTRAMI, TUNA--
I WOULD'VE TAKEN TUNA...

11:56.367 --> 11:59.267
EVEN WITH THE MERCURY.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.733
WHAT STINKS IN HERE?
( sniffs )

12:03.767 --> 12:06.467
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK YOU SMELL
FROM THE ONION.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.067
YOU WANT A MINT?

12:10.067 --> 12:13.367
TAKE A MINT.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.667
NO MINT?

12:15.700 --> 12:18.600
I GOT A WHOLE HANDFUL
OF THEM.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.067
WHAT?

12:26.067 --> 12:28.400
WHAT?

12:33.267 --> 12:34.900
WHAT IS IT?

12:34.933 --> 12:37.200
I DIDN'T...

12:40.700 --> 12:43.200
( muttering )

12:45.833 --> 12:47.233
I'M A DOCTOR?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.800
WHAT?
I'M A DOCTOR?

12:49.833 --> 12:51.800
( muttering )

12:55.333 --> 12:58.367
I'M, A-ADOPTED?

12:58.400 --> 12:59.833
ADOPTED?

12:59.867 --> 13:01.733
- ( gasps )
- Nurse: I'M SORRY.

13:01.767 --> 13:04.300
- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.
- DID YOU SAY I'M ADOPTED?

13:04.333 --> 13:05.967
Larry:
OKAY, OKAY.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.567
- NOW.
- OKAY.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.600
- "ADOPTED," YOU SAID?
- YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW.

13:09.633 --> 13:12.067
- LET'S GO NOW.
- DAD, I'M ADOPTED?

13:12.067 --> 13:14.600
- I'M ADOPTED?
- LET'S GO.

13:14.633 --> 13:15.567
LET'S GO.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.867
Larry:
I'M ADOPTED.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.400
I THINK I'M ADOPTED.
I MIGHT BE ADOPTED.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.533
I THINK I'M ADOPTED.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.800
I COULD BE ADOPTED.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.267
I MIGHT BE ADOPTED.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.833
Actress:
DENNIS, HEY!

13:33.867 --> 13:35.767
WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

13:35.800 --> 13:37.067
UPSTAIRS.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.500
UPSTAIRS?
WHAT THE-- ?

13:39.533 --> 13:42.167
HEY, DO YOU MIND
IF I STOP THIS
FOR A SECOND?

13:42.200 --> 13:44.133
Ted:
I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.233
MAYBE IT'D BE
MORE FUNNY IF...

13:46.267 --> 13:48.900
I'VE SUSPECTED THIS
A LONG TIME.
I REALLY DID.

13:48.933 --> 13:52.200
THE ONLY NOTICEABLE THING
I HAVE IN COMMON WITH THEM,

13:52.233 --> 13:54.133
HONEST TO GOD,
IS MY PENMANSHIP.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.733
I NOTICED THERE'S
A SIMILARITY.

13:55.767 --> 13:56.667
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
WITH THE STROKE

13:56.700 --> 13:58.900
WITH OXYGEN
TO HIS BRAIN?

13:58.933 --> 14:02.967
- COME ON. ADOPTED?
- DON'T RUIN THIS FOR ME.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.200
- I'M NOT TRYING TO RUIN IT.
- DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.500
- Ted: LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- HEY!

14:06.533 --> 14:08.700
- HEY, JEFF. HEY, MAN.
- I CAN'T SHAKE.

14:08.733 --> 14:11.067
BAD FINGERS.
HURT MY FINGERS.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.933
ALL RIGHT.
I AM SO BUMMED OUT.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.967
- I'M AWFUL. I'M DON'T KNOW
HOW TO BE FUNNY ANYMORE.
- IT'S NOT YOU.

14:17.067 --> 14:20.267
- IT'S THE WRITING.
- WHY ARE YOU HERE
BY THE WAY?

14:20.300 --> 14:22.067
NO-- WE WERE JUST--
I WAS AT HIS OFFICE.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.567
THOUGHT I'D BRING HIM BY.
TOLD HIM YOU WERE FILMING
HERE.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.167
- HE GOT EXCITED.
- I FIGURED I WOULD
CHECK OUT THE PILOT.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.400
THANKS, BUDDY.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

14:28.433 --> 14:30.233
OH, GUESS WHAT?

14:30.267 --> 14:32.767
- LEO'S-- YOU KNOW.
- YEAH.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.300
- THEY NAMED
A SANDWICH AFTER ME.
- YOU'RE KIDDING?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.433
- I GOT A SANDWICH.
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.733
- I'M ON THE BOARD.
- YOU'VE ARRIVED.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.433
- I'M ON THE BOARD.
- THAT IS FANTASTIC.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.833
- YEP.
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

14:44.867 --> 14:47.300
THE THING ABOUT IT--
I WAS WONDERING,

14:47.333 --> 14:48.800
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU DON'T
GO IN THERE VERY MUCH--

14:48.833 --> 14:52.533
I'M IN THERE ALL THE TIME.
I'M IN THERE THREE TIMES
A WEEK.

14:52.567 --> 14:55.800
YOU KNOW, AND IN AS MUCH
AS YOU DON'T GO IN THERE,

14:55.833 --> 14:58.667
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT MAYBE--

14:58.700 --> 15:00.733
'CAUSE MY SANDWICH
IS A GREAT SANDWICH,

15:00.767 --> 15:03.133
BUT I'M NOT REALLY
A FISH GUY.

15:03.167 --> 15:05.967
- YEAH.
- YOU GOTTA LIKE FISH.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.167
- EH.
- YOU LIKE FISH,
BUT ANYWAY--

15:08.200 --> 15:11.633
SO I WAS THINKING
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T MIND
SWITCHING WITH ME.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.300
SWITCHING SANDWICHES?

15:13.333 --> 15:16.233
YOU DON'T GO IN THERE.
I'D LIKE TO EAT MY OWN
SANDWICH.

15:16.267 --> 15:20.333
IT WOULD BE FUN
TO GO IN WITH MY DAD
AND EAT MY OWN SANDWICH.

15:20.367 --> 15:23.267
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT THE HELL.
WHAT'S THE HARM?

15:23.300 --> 15:25.467
- REALLY?
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

15:25.500 --> 15:27.167
- FANTASTIC!
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.500
JUST SO IF ANYONE ASKS ME,
WHAT'S IN MY NEW SANDWICH?

15:29.533 --> 15:31.633
OKAY, IT'S, UM--

15:31.667 --> 15:33.567
YOU GOT WHITEFISH.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.667
YOU KNOW WHITEFISH?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.167
- WHITEFISH.
- WHITEFISH,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.400
AND SABLE.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.067
WHAT IS SABLE?

15:41.067 --> 15:44.433
- SABLE. IT'S A FISH.
- IT'S LIKE A WHITEFISH.
IT'S A SMOKED FISH.

15:44.467 --> 15:47.233
- IT'S A SMOKED FISH.
- YOU HAVE TWO FISHES?

15:47.267 --> 15:49.467
YEAH, BUT THEY BLEND
VERY WELL TOGETHER.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.633
THEY'RE LIKE SIAMESE TWINS,
WHITEFISH AND SABLE.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.967
WHAT ELSE IS IN IT?

15:53.067 --> 15:55.100
- NO CONDIMENTS?
- Jeff: CREAM CHEESE.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.600
THERE'S SOME CREAM CHEESE.
IT'S--

15:59.633 --> 16:00.267
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.200
CAPERS.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.667
THEY'RE MAY BE SOME CAPERS.
I'M NOT SURE.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.800
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,
YOU CAN BRUSH THEM OFF.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.433
- NOT A BIG DEAL.
- ONIONS.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.433
YEAH.

16:14.567 --> 16:18.367
( stammers )

16:18.400 --> 16:20.100
THAT'S SOUNDS AWFUL.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.500
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
AWFUL?

16:23.533 --> 16:27.467
MY SANDWICH IS TURKEY,
COLESLAW, RUSSIAN DRESSING.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.700
IT'S A CLASSIC.
PEOPLE COME IN,
THEY ORDER A TED DANSON.

16:29.733 --> 16:32.667
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE.
YOU DON'T GO IN THERE.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.067
PEOPLE ARE USED
TO MY SANDWICH,

16:34.100 --> 16:36.867
THEY SHOW UP
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY'RE EATING--

16:36.900 --> 16:40.067
THE TED DANSON SANDWICH
ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS HERRING
AND LOX.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.600
- IT'S NOT HERRING.
- CAPERS.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.433
- ONIONS.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP.

16:44.467 --> 16:46.467
IT'S NOT HERRING, OKAY?

16:46.500 --> 16:49.133
IT'S WHITEFISH AND SABLE.
THAT'S NOT HERRING.

16:49.167 --> 16:52.067
INSTEAD OF ORDERING
A TED DANSON, PEOPLE
ORDER A LARRY DAVID.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.067
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

16:53.067 --> 16:55.533
ONE TASTES GOOD
AND ONE SUCKS!

16:55.567 --> 16:57.400
WHY DON'T YOU
TASTE THE SANDWICH?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.233
- TASTE IT!
- I DON'T WANNA TASTE IT!

16:59.267 --> 17:01.100
- YOU CAN'T EVEN TASTE IT?
- I DON'T WANNA TASTE IT!

17:01.133 --> 17:03.167
- YOU WON'T EVEN TASTE IT?
- YOU KEEP IT.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.500
- Ted: I'M WON'T TASTE
YOUR STUPID SANDWICH.
- SO YOU'RE NOT TASTING IT?

17:08.767 --> 17:11.800
TICKETS?
TICKETS?
WHO NEEDS--

17:11.833 --> 17:13.767
WHO NEEDS TICKETS?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.900
TICKETS?

17:15.933 --> 17:18.767
HAPPY NEW YEAR.
TICKETS?

17:18.800 --> 17:21.500
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

17:21.533 --> 17:22.367
YOU NEED TICKETS?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.700
YOU GOT SOMETHING?

17:23.733 --> 17:26.533
- DO I HAVE--
I HAVE THE BEST SEATS.
- YEAH?

17:26.567 --> 17:29.267
I HAVE FABULOUS--
TWO SEATS, RIGHT DOWN FRONT.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.900
- THE CANTOR WILL BE PRACTICALLY
SPITTING ALL OVER YOU.
- REALLY?

17:31.933 --> 17:35.133
- HOW MUCH?
- GIVE ME $600 FOR THE TWO.

17:35.167 --> 17:35.767
- I'LL GIVE YOU
$300 FOR THE PAIR.
- I'LL TAKE $300.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.067
I'LL TAKE THE $300.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.067
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT A DEAL THIS IS.

17:46.100 --> 17:46.800
INCREDIBLE DEAL
YOU GOT HERE.

17:46.833 --> 17:47.933
( mumbles )

17:52.633 --> 17:54.900
- HERE YOU ARE.
- ALL RIGHT.

17:54.933 --> 17:57.600
- YOU'RE NOT SCREWING ME?
- YOU'RE SCREWING ME MAYBE.

17:57.633 --> 18:00.467
I'M GIVING YOU THE DEAL
OF A LIFETIME.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.100
- Jeff: HEY! ALL GOOD.
- Susie: GOT THEM.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.700
- GOT THEM.
- Jeff: HOW MUCH?

18:04.733 --> 18:06.233
- PFFT!
- Jeff: REALLY?

18:06.267 --> 18:07.700
- YEAH YEAH.
- OH, JEEZ.

18:07.733 --> 18:09.933
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU BUY TICKETS.

18:09.967 --> 18:12.433
- Susie: IT'S A POPULAR DAY.
- TOO MANY JEWS TO GO AROUND.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.567
Susie:
EXACTLY.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.533
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU
FOR CARPOOLING WITH US.

18:16.567 --> 18:18.900
I REALLY NEVER EXPECTED
YOU'D GET IN MY CAR AGAIN

18:18.933 --> 18:21.167
- AFTER THE OTHER NIGHT.
- Cheryl: WE'RE SORRY.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.767
LISTEN,
THIS ADOPTION THING,

18:23.800 --> 18:25.467
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.567
ISN'T THERE AN AUNT
OR AN UNCLE OR SOMEBODY
FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD?

18:28.600 --> 18:31.367
ANY RELATIVE WHO WOULD KNOW,
THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.967
- Susie: THEY'RE ALL DEAD?
EVERY LAST ONE?
- ALL DEAD.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.800
THERE'S ONE PERSON.

18:36.833 --> 18:39.900
- I HAD A NANNY
WHEN I WAS--
- ( laughs )

18:39.933 --> 18:42.333
- YOU HAD A NANNY?
- I HAD A NANNY--
JOHANNA SEIDERMAN--

18:42.367 --> 18:45.067
- Susie: YEAH?
- --WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID.

18:45.067 --> 18:48.733
ANTOINETTE TRACKED
HER DOWN.

18:48.767 --> 18:51.133
THERE'S A JOHANNA SEIDERMAN
IN A NURSING HOME

18:51.167 --> 18:52.433
- IN QUEENS...
- REALLY?

18:52.467 --> 18:54.467
AND I'VE WRITTEN HER
A LETTER.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.867
THIS IS TERRIFIC.
THAT WAY YOU'LL HAVE
DEFINITIVE "YES, NO."

18:56.900 --> 19:00.733
- YES.
- YOU MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY,
BUT YOU'LL KNOW.

19:00.767 --> 19:02.367
LET ME ASK
YOU GUYS A QUESTION.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.333
YOU PICK UP THE PHONE
DURING SEX?

19:04.367 --> 19:06.300
- NO!
- WHY WOULD YOU PICK UP?

19:06.333 --> 19:08.800
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN INTIMATE MOMENT
WITH YOUR LOVED ONE.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.467
- YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP?
- I'M--

19:10.500 --> 19:12.167
- FINE.
- Jeff: WHY WOULD
YOU PICK UP?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.933
Jeff: IF EVERY BLUE MOON
I HAVE SEX, I'M NOT
GONNA PICK UP.

19:13.967 --> 19:17.167
- Susie: WHY DO YOU HAVE
AN ANSWERING MACHINE?
- Cheryl: THANK YOU.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.367
Susie: YOU'RE HAVING
AN INTIMATE MOMENT
AND YOU PICK UP?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.200
- Jeff: WHO DOES THAT?
- Man: HEY, LARRY.

19:22.233 --> 19:24.700
LARRY, ROB.

19:24.733 --> 19:27.600
OH, CAN'T SHAKE, ROB.
GOT A BAD HAND.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.733
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

19:28.767 --> 19:32.100
- UM, SO THIS YOUR WIFE?
- NO! WHAT? NO!

19:32.133 --> 19:34.400
- WHAT KIND OF
RESPONSE IS THAT?
- THAT'S MY WIFE.

19:34.433 --> 19:36.667
OH, HEY,
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.567
- OKAY, SEE YOU INSIDE.
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.833
- SORRY? WHAT?
- REALLY! IT'S ALWAYS
A THING.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.500
- OH, STOP.
- "NO NO NO NO!"

19:43.533 --> 19:46.433
- Jeff: WHAT?!
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR AL CAPONE HAT ON.

19:46.467 --> 19:49.100
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
A VERY EXPENSIVE HAT,
MISTER.

19:49.133 --> 19:51.733
- IT'S RUDE.
- LET'S GO IN AND PRAY.

19:51.767 --> 19:52.967
Jeff:
LET'S GO IN AND PRAY.

19:53.067 --> 19:58.067
SORRY, SUSIE.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.933
( speaking in Hebrew )

20:00.967 --> 20:04.667
"BE AMONG THOSE
WHO CHERISH TRUTH
ABOVE EASE.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.933
THEIR FRUIT WE EAT NOW;

20:06.967 --> 20:10.767
THEIR ESSENCE REMAINS FOR US
IN THE LIFE TO COME.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.733
( speaking in Hebrew )

20:21.667 --> 20:23.967
( singing in Hebrew )

20:46.233 --> 20:48.133
( whispers )
HEY HEY.

20:48.167 --> 20:49.833
- HOW'D YOU GET THAT SANDWICH?

20:49.867 --> 20:52.800
- THAT SANDWICH AT THE DELI!
- LEO GAVE IT TO ME.

20:52.833 --> 20:55.033
- THAT'S HOW I GOT IT.
- DID YOU BRIBE HIM?

20:55.067 --> 20:56.867
I BRIBED HIM.
THAT'S RICH.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.167
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:58.200 --> 21:00.467
- HOW MANY TIMES
A WEEK DO YOU GO?
- I DON'T KNOW. TWO?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.333
- I GO THERE
FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
- BIG DEAL.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.733
I EAT ANYTHING
OFF THE MENU.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.633
- I EAT A LOT OF STUFF TOO.
- I TAKE STUFF OUT.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.167
- I GET DELIVERIES.
- I GIVE IT TO CHARITY.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.433

21:08.467 --> 21:10.233
Larry: WHAT WERE YOUTALKING TO
HIM ABOUT?

21:10.267 --> 21:12.333
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
THE NEW YEAR.

21:12.367 --> 21:14.667
"LEO, I DIDN'T
GET A SANDWICH.
I WANT A SANDWICH."

21:14.700 --> 21:18.100
YOUR SANDWICH STINKS,
BY THE WAY. IT STINKS!

21:18.133 --> 21:19.833
YOU STINK.

21:19.867 --> 21:22.367
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
I'M GONNA NEED

21:23.867 --> 21:26.167

21:26.200 --> 21:28.633
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.333
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

21:33.633 --> 21:35.100

21:36.800 --> 21:38.667

21:41.200 --> 21:43.433

21:43.467 --> 21:45.200

YOU LITTLE SNITCH.
HE SPILLED THE COFFEE,
BY THE WAY,

21:52.933 --> 21:54.967
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
PUT MY FINGERS THROUGH
YOUR DAINTY CUP!

21:55.067 --> 21:58.333
YOU'RE SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE
FOR MY GENTILE WIFE.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.733
IT'S HER FIRST TIME
IN TEMPLE.

22:00.767 --> 22:02.267
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- THEY'RE KICKING US OUT.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.733
- ARE YOU GONNA WAIT?
- IT'S GONNA BE AN
HOUR AND A HALF.

22:04.767 --> 22:06.800
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET HOME?
WE CARPOOLED WITH YOU.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.967
YOU'LL GET A RIDE.
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE.

22:09.067 --> 22:12.067
- Guard: LET'S GO.
- GET A RIDE.

22:12.100 --> 22:15.433
Cantor:
FRIENDS, LET US
CONTINUE ON PAGE 133.

22:18.067 --> 22:20.900
- I SAW YOU ROLL
ABOUT SEVEN FEET PAST.
- YEAH.

22:20.933 --> 22:23.267
Larry:
GET THIS: THE DOCTOR
DIVORCED HIS WIFE

22:23.300 --> 22:24.867
AND IS SEEING
HIS SECRETARY.

22:26.633 --> 22:28.367
- Larry: JUST TOLD ME.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.533
- THIS GUY.
- HEH.

22:30.567 --> 22:31.933
- DID YOU HEAR
FROM THE NANNY?
- NO.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.600
NO, NOT YET.

22:34.633 --> 22:36.767
- YOU MUST BE
ON PINS AND NEEDLES.
- YEAH.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.067
BUT I THINK IF SHE
GETS THE LETTER,

22:39.100 --> 22:40.633
SHE'S GONNA GET
IN TOUCH WITH ME.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.067
WE'LL SEE.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.300
- THAT'S WILD.
- ISN'T IT?

22:43.333 --> 22:44.900
YEAH YEAH YEAH.

23:01.267 --> 23:03.500
HE'S GOT THE YIPS.

23:08.833 --> 23:10.233
- Cheryl: THE WHAT?
- ( Larry sighs )

23:10.267 --> 23:11.600
Larry:
THE YIPS.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.867
- THE YIPS!
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.567
- YOU NEVER HEARD
OF THE YIPS?
- NO.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.467
OKAY, IT'S IN GOLF.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.300
YOU LINE UP TO PUTT
AND YOUR HANDS SHAKE.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.767
HE WAS SHAKING
LIKE THIS.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.733
WELL, MAYBE IT'S JUST
A GOLF CONDITION.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.833
HE GETS NERVOUS
WHEN HE PUTTS.

23:27.867 --> 23:31.400
I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.
HE'S OPERATING ON MY FATHER.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.900
YOU NEED TO CALL HIM
AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT.

23:33.933 --> 23:35.467
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET SOMEBODY ELSE.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.400
- I HATE DOING
STUFF LIKE THIS.
- YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

23:38.433 --> 23:39.767
I HATE THESE CALLS.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.800
PICK UP THE PHONE
AND CALL THE DOCTOR.

23:43.833 --> 23:45.600
MAYBE YOU COULD
CALL HIM.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.533
IF IT WAS MY FATHER

23:47.567 --> 23:49.300
I WOULD'VE ALREADY BEEN
ON THE PHONE.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.900
OKAY.

23:59.367 --> 24:01.067
YOU SHOULD GO OUT
OF THE ROOM

24:01.067 --> 24:03.300
'CAUSE I CAN'T DO THIS
IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY,
HONEST TO GOD.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.833
COULD YOU LEAVE THE ROOM?
IT'S LIKE CALLING FOR A DATE.

24:06.867 --> 24:09.933
- I NEED PRIVACY.
- OY.

24:09.967 --> 24:13.533
( tones beep )

24:15.700 --> 24:19.367
- ( phone ringing )
- ( moaning )

24:27.967 --> 24:30.200
I NEVER--
I NEVER SAID
YOU WERE ADOPTED.

24:30.233 --> 24:31.700
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID.

24:31.733 --> 24:32.967
NO, I NEVER SAID THAT.

24:33.067 --> 24:35.800
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
TO YOU, NO.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.367
IT'S NOT TRUE, NO.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.267
- YOU'RE NOT ADOPTED.
- IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN TELL ME.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.800
- I CAN TAKE IT.
ARE YOU SURE?
- YOU'RE NOT.

24:41.833 --> 24:45.300
LISTEN, THAT
LARRY DAVID SANDWICH,

24:45.333 --> 24:46.433
I DIDN'T FINISH IT.

24:46.467 --> 24:49.067
I REMEMBER SEEING
A HALF A SANDWICH

24:49.067 --> 24:50.200
STILL ON THAT TABLE.

24:50.233 --> 24:51.767
YOU WANT
THE OTHER HALF?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.600
YOU KNOW, I JUST RAN
INTO YOUR DOCTOR.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.100
I'M MEETING HIM
THERE FOR LUNCH.

24:55.133 --> 24:57.500
- WHAT A NIGHTMARE
THAT'S GONNA BE.
- WHAT?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.500
YOU SURE
I'M NOT ADOPTED?

25:05.167 --> 25:07.900
I NEVER SAID THAT.
NEVER.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.167
OKAY.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.567
WE'LL SEE WHAT
MRS. SEIDERMAN HAS TO SAY.

25:45.667 --> 25:48.467
AH! UM...

25:50.067 --> 25:51.833
I'D LIKE
A LARRY DAVID
TO GO, PLEASE.

25:51.867 --> 25:55.100
OH, WE DON'T HAVE
THAT SANDWICH ANYMORE.

25:55.133 --> 25:57.067
- WHAT?
- THEY CHANGED THE NAME.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.700
Richard:
AND I SAY THAT IT HAPPENS
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.733
( guffawing )

26:09.767 --> 26:12.067
I SWEAR TO GOD.
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU,
NOT TO YOU GUYS.

26:12.067 --> 26:14.567
LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

26:14.600 --> 26:17.967
YOU STOLE MY SANDWICH?
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID?

26:18.067 --> 26:19.667
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

26:19.700 --> 26:22.367
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU STOLE MY SANDWICH!

26:22.400 --> 26:25.467
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- LOOK AT THE BOARD!

26:25.500 --> 26:26.700
YOU'RE BLAMING ME?

26:26.733 --> 26:28.900
I SAW YOU TALKING TO HIM
OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE.

26:28.933 --> 26:31.733
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
- YOU DON'T THINK I SAW YOU?

26:31.767 --> 26:33.333
I ALWAYS TALK
TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE.

26:33.367 --> 26:34.800
IT'S ROSH HASHANAH!
IT'S THE NEW YEAR!

26:34.833 --> 26:37.567
I TALK TO DELI OWNERS!
I TALK TO PAWNBROKERS!

26:37.600 --> 26:39.567
"LEO, CAN I PLEASE
HAVE A SANDWICH?"

26:39.600 --> 26:42.700
- OH, BULLSHIT!
- YOU WERE SO JEALOUS
THAT I HAD A SANDWICH,

26:42.733 --> 26:44.300
YOU JUST COULDN'T
TAKE IT, COULD YOU?

26:44.333 --> 26:46.400
YOU HAD TO GET
YOUR SANDWICH!

26:46.433 --> 26:48.433
I GOT INFORMATION
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

26:48.467 --> 26:50.233
I CAN'T WAIT.
WHAT IS IT?

26:50.267 --> 26:52.067
I'M ADOPTED.

26:52.067 --> 26:54.433
- BULLSHIT.
- BULLSHIT?

26:54.467 --> 26:56.533
BULLSHIT?
NO, IT'S NOT BULLSHIT.

26:56.567 --> 26:58.467
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE ADOPTED?

26:58.500 --> 27:00.067
I'M ADOPTED.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.933
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- MY FATHER TOLD ME.

27:02.967 --> 27:05.933
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR PARENTS ARE?
- THEY'RE NOT THOSE NUTS!

27:05.967 --> 27:08.067
I KNOW THAT, BUT I KNOW
WHO YOURS ARE.

27:08.100 --> 27:11.333
- FUCK.

ENJOY.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.067

OF THE ADOPTED!
- ( groans )

27:22.467 --> 27:24.233
LARRY,
COME ON OVER HERE.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.067
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO?

27:26.067 --> 27:27.933
I'M GOING TO LET YOU
HAVE ANY SANDWICH
YOU WANT.

27:27.967 --> 27:29.933

27:29.967 --> 27:31.133
- GO AHEAD, TAKE IT.
- OH, BOY.

27:31.167 --> 27:33.933
- TAKE IT.
- IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.

27:33.967 --> 27:36.367
OKAY OKAY, I WAIT.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.267
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO GO WITH THAT TED DANSON.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.600
- TED DANSON?
THAT'S YOURS.
- YEAH.

27:40.633 --> 27:43.333

I WANT YOU

27:50.367 --> 27:52.267

27:53.900 --> 27:55.633
( whimpers )

28:02.200 --> 28:04.300
I THINK I'LL GET THAT
LARRY DAVID TO GO.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.633
( phone ringing )

28:11.400 --> 28:13.900
DO NOT EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

28:13.933 --> 28:16.500
I'M EXPECTING A PHONE CALL
FROM MRS. SEIDERMAN.

28:16.533 --> 28:19.200
- WHO?
- YOU KNOW, MY NANNY.

28:19.233 --> 28:21.467
( ringing continues )

28:21.500 --> 28:25.400
DO NOT PICK UP
THAT PHONE.

28:31.867 --> 28:34.367
NOBODY'S PICKING UP.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.967
- ( line ringing )
- I HAD AN ANSWER

28:37.067 --> 28:39.233
TO HIS QUESTION.

28:39.267 --> 28:43.467
IF ONLY HE HAD
PICKED UP.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.267
( sighs )

28:45.300 --> 28:47.133
MRS. SEIDERMAN?

28:47.167 --> 28:50.167
MRS. SEIDERMAN.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.533
- ( theme music playing )

28:52.567 --> 28:54.800
MRS. SEIDERMAN?!
