00:01.667 --> 00:03.917
[instrumental music]

00:14.833 --> 00:16.875
[indistinct chattering]

00:17.500 --> 00:18.583
[door whirring]

00:21.000 --> 00:22.125
(Susan)
'Good morning.'

00:23.500 --> 00:24.750
'Now, let's take
a look at the manifests.'

00:24.833 --> 00:26.000
'See who's coming in today.'

00:28.167 --> 00:29.917
'Hmm.'

00:30.000 --> 00:31.417
'Couple of Drazi ships.'

00:31.500 --> 00:33.708
'Minbari personal transport.'

00:33.792 --> 00:35.125
Even a few Vree.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.458
Still not quite
where we used to be

00:36.542 --> 00:38.333
but it's a start.

00:38.417 --> 00:40.417
Alright, put me online
with the first ship

00:40.500 --> 00:41.792
and let's get this show
on the road.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.000
[clapping]

00:46.292 --> 00:47.375
What?

00:49.542 --> 00:50.625
Is there a problem?

00:58.042 --> 00:59.583
[screaming]

00:59.667 --> 01:00.625
Oh.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.500
[panting]

01:02.583 --> 01:04.500
Oh!

01:04.583 --> 01:06.458
[panting]

01:08.375 --> 01:10.208
God, I hate dreams like that.

01:10.292 --> 01:14.458
(automated message)
'Good morning.
The time is 0530 EST'

01:14.542 --> 01:16.625
'July 3rd, 2260.'

01:16.708 --> 01:17.958
'Have a nice day.'

01:20.250 --> 01:22.333
[instrumental music]

01:30.417 --> 01:31.542
[door latch clicking]

01:35.208 --> 01:37.667
- 'There you are!'
- Oh!

01:37.750 --> 01:39.292
I was just looking, really.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.292
I-I didn't touch a thing, it's..
Well, maybe the drapes, a bit

01:42.375 --> 01:43.583
but there was this large
flying thing

01:43.667 --> 01:45.667
that I tried to,
you know, swat.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.125
The Emperor has just finished

01:47.208 --> 01:49.417
reviewing your reports
from Minbar.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.000
He asked me to convey
his compliments

01:52.083 --> 01:53.750
on your hard work

01:53.833 --> 01:55.625
even if some parts of it
do read

01:55.708 --> 01:58.333
as if they were written
by Ambassador Mollari.

01:58.417 --> 02:02.542
- He advised me on a few things.
- I thought as much.

02:02.625 --> 02:05.125
Londo belongs to the old school.

02:05.208 --> 02:09.042
He thinks we must be protected
from the truth.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.875
But these are perilous times.

02:10.958 --> 02:13.000
We must have
accurate information

02:13.083 --> 02:15.208
about what other worlds
are doing.

02:15.292 --> 02:20.375
You would do well to follow your
own judgment in future.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.667
Thank you, minister.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.458
Oh, we have arranged for a ship

02:23.542 --> 02:25.500
to take you back
to Babylon 5

02:25.583 --> 02:27.833
as soon as
you are ready to travel.

02:27.917 --> 02:30.542
From there, you will
continue to Minbar.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.500
Well, I'll let you go back
to your room now

02:32.583 --> 02:34.125
so that you can pack.

02:34.208 --> 02:38.042
- Yes, sir.
- Oh! I heard a new joke.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.833
[laughing]

02:40.917 --> 02:43.917
W-w-what is more dangerous

02:44.000 --> 02:48.792
than a locked room
full of angry Narns?

02:48.875 --> 02:50.500
[chuckling]

02:50.583 --> 02:52.083
I don't know,
what is more dangerous

02:52.167 --> 02:54.083
than a locked room
full of angry Narns?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.292
One angry Narn

02:57.375 --> 02:59.375
with the key.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.542
[both laughing]

03:01.625 --> 03:02.542
You!

03:02.625 --> 03:05.250
[laughing continues]

03:05.333 --> 03:07.417
W-w-with the key.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.458
[laughing]

03:08.542 --> 03:10.125
[gibberish]
I don't..

03:11.000 --> 03:13.958
[instrumental music]

03:29.917 --> 03:34.583
(Susan)
The Babylon project was
our last best hope for peace.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.625
It failed.

03:39.708 --> 03:42.750
[dramatic music]

03:54.875 --> 03:56.500
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:56.583 --> 03:58.792
it became something greater.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.083
Our last best hope..

04:01.167 --> 04:02.292
...for victory.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.208
The year is 2260.

04:09.292 --> 04:12.208
The place, Babylon 5.

04:13.375 --> 04:16.417
[theme music]

04:43.375 --> 04:46.417
[music continues]

04:57.500 --> 04:59.333
[instrumental music]

04:59.417 --> 05:01.667
Same thing.
Night after night.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.958
I mean,
one bad dream after another.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.583
You know,
I-I get the one where your

05:05.667 --> 05:07.417
your teeth are breaking off
or falling out

05:07.500 --> 05:08.917
and you wake up going, aah!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.875
- You know?
- Oh, yeah. I know that one.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.542
Or you're lost
in a maze somewhere

05:12.625 --> 05:16.333
or I'm someplace
where I've never been before.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.625
This morning

05:17.708 --> 05:20.042
I dreamt that
I walked into C and C totally..

05:21.458 --> 05:23.000
...unprepared for my work.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.375
Oh.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.833
Interested in a little
dime store psychoanalysis?

05:27.917 --> 05:29.417
No, I'm just baring my soul

05:29.500 --> 05:32.000
as a preface to asking you
to give me some silverware.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.625
[chuckling]

05:33.708 --> 05:36.750
Every one of these dreams puts
you in unfamiliar territory.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.750
A maze or some strange place.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.125
Well, that is kind of like
where we are right now.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.333
When did you join Earthforce?

05:45.417 --> 05:46.458
[sighing]

05:46.542 --> 05:48.167
2247.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.958
Alright, so we're talking
13 years.

05:51.042 --> 05:52.542
'We're both career military.'

05:52.625 --> 05:55.667
'That means we define
who we are by what we do.'

05:55.750 --> 05:58.292
We left all of that behind
when we broke away from Earth.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.375
Yeah, but I've already
dealt with all that.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.250
Hmm, consciously.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.917
But from what you were saying

06:04.000 --> 06:06.958
subconsciously, you're still
trying to work it all through.

06:07.042 --> 06:09.042
You don't know
where you fit anymore

06:09.125 --> 06:10.333
'harder to find yourself.'

06:10.417 --> 06:12.000
'You're feeling vulnerable'

06:12.083 --> 06:13.958
'lost and exposed.'

06:14.042 --> 06:17.167
It's all perfectly obvious
and completely understandable.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.667
I suppose, I just..

06:18.750 --> 06:20.167
...just hate waking up in the
middle of the night

06:20.250 --> 06:23.292
not knowing who I am,
or where I am, or..

06:24.500 --> 06:25.458
...even what I am.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.208
[chuckling]
It'll pass.

06:27.292 --> 06:30.625
Your subconscious just needs
to work it all through.

06:30.708 --> 06:32.917
Hey, it could be worse,
you could be having dreams

06:33.000 --> 06:34.792
where you're showing up to work
naked.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.500
[both chuckling]

06:36.583 --> 06:37.958
'Then you'd be in real trouble.'

06:38.042 --> 06:39.125
[John laughing]

06:40.875 --> 06:43.083
You know, I'm gonna get some
more of this...whatever it is.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.208
- You want anything?
- No. I'm fine.

06:45.292 --> 06:47.208
- Ah, alright.
- Thanks.

06:48.292 --> 06:49.625
Shit!

06:49.708 --> 06:52.750
[instrumental music]

07:02.250 --> 07:05.292
[insects screeching]

07:08.542 --> 07:09.458
Dah!

07:09.542 --> 07:10.792
[insects screeching]

07:14.875 --> 07:17.333
Where are you now, hmm?

07:17.417 --> 07:18.500
[insects screeching]

07:20.708 --> 07:21.833
Dah!

07:21.917 --> 07:22.917
Aah!

07:23.000 --> 07:24.833
[clattering]

07:24.917 --> 07:27.125
[grunting]

07:31.667 --> 07:32.958
[device beeping]

07:33.042 --> 07:35.042
(male #1)
'Maintenance. Can I help you?'

07:35.125 --> 07:37.083
Yes, you can help me.

07:37.167 --> 07:38.417
Two hours ago.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.917
Two hours ago

07:40.000 --> 07:40.917
I called you.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.208
I told you there is..

07:43.292 --> 07:44.833
...a-a bug.

07:44.917 --> 07:47.542
An insect in my quarters.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.250
(male #1)
'Uh, we've been a little busy.'

07:49.333 --> 07:50.458
Now, you listen to me.

07:50.542 --> 07:53.750
I do not like insects.

07:53.833 --> 07:57.500
I do not like
little brown things

07:57.583 --> 07:58.750
with eight legs.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.917
I do not like anything
with eight legs.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.208
Well, except for the Vinzini.

08:05.292 --> 08:07.042
But only because
they are terrible at cards

08:07.125 --> 08:09.583
something to do
with compound eyes I think.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.125
I want this thing dead!

08:12.208 --> 08:15.625
(male #1)
'Sorry, ambassador, but due to
recent changes in our status'

08:15.708 --> 08:17.250
'we've had to cut back
on inspectors'

08:17.333 --> 08:19.375
'and time to time,
insects are gonna get in.'

08:19.458 --> 08:21.167
'We'll get somebody there
soon as we can.'

08:21.250 --> 08:22.667
No, don't hang up on me.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.833
Don't hang up on me!

08:23.917 --> 08:25.000
[device beeping]

08:26.208 --> 08:27.458
Hung up on me.

08:27.542 --> 08:29.667
[yelling]

08:29.750 --> 08:31.792
[insects screeching]

08:31.875 --> 08:32.958
[sighing]

08:39.083 --> 08:39.958
Die!

08:40.042 --> 08:41.167
[chuckling softly]

08:41.250 --> 08:42.375
[sword clanking]

08:42.458 --> 08:43.542
Die!

08:43.625 --> 08:46.750
Die! Die! Die!

08:46.833 --> 08:49.667
[grunting]

08:49.750 --> 08:52.792
[laughing]

08:54.625 --> 08:56.042
There, you see?

08:56.125 --> 08:59.750
This will teach you
to trifle with a Centauri

08:59.833 --> 09:02.042
you triple-damned..

09:03.375 --> 09:04.750
Do you know that..

09:04.833 --> 09:08.000
Do you know that you are smaller
than I thought you were?

09:08.083 --> 09:09.583
[panting]

09:11.625 --> 09:13.458
You are smaller.

09:13.542 --> 09:16.458
[whimpering]
There are more of you.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.625
There are more of you!

09:18.708 --> 09:19.708
[doorbell chiming]

09:19.792 --> 09:20.833
Yes!

09:20.917 --> 09:22.042
[door whirring]

09:26.375 --> 09:28.667
You are Ambassador Mollari?

09:28.750 --> 09:31.000
My dear lady.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.750
For you, I would be..

09:33.833 --> 09:36.333
...anyone you want me to be.

09:36.417 --> 09:39.000
- Hm.
- Please, come in.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.625
Come in.

09:40.708 --> 09:42.750
(automated message)
'May I have your attention,
please?'

09:44.208 --> 09:46.417
'Please consult
your transport agency'

09:46.500 --> 09:48.250
'for schedule information.'

09:48.333 --> 09:50.500
Excuse me. Have you seen
Ambassador Mollari?

09:50.583 --> 09:52.125
He always meets me here.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.458
[exhaling deeply]

09:58.542 --> 09:59.583
Morning, Delenn.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.167
Captain.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.000
How are things
with your government?

10:03.083 --> 10:05.417
Well, for the moment
blissfully quiet.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.958
At least so far
as we're concerned.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.792
Uh, President Clark's
having a hard time

10:09.875 --> 10:11.500
keeping everything
bottled up back home.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.542
So, we're not on the top of his
list of priorities right now.

10:14.625 --> 10:15.958
The resistance?

10:16.042 --> 10:19.750
Gathering their forces,
putting their people into place.

10:19.833 --> 10:22.125
With everybody busy
planning their next move

10:22.208 --> 10:24.083
we get a break.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.000
It'll be short,
but I'll take it.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.042
[chuckling softly]
Which brings me to you.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.000
- Me?
- Yes.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.042
You know, every time
that I have seen you lately

10:33.125 --> 10:35.625
we've been
in the middle of a crisis

10:35.708 --> 10:37.208
a revolution.

10:37.292 --> 10:38.875
I mean,
it's the first time in months

10:38.958 --> 10:40.000
that it's been this quiet.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.292
It won't last.
It never does.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.458
But as long as it's here..

10:47.292 --> 10:48.625
...I'd like to see you tonight.

10:49.583 --> 10:50.583
[chuckling]

10:50.667 --> 10:52.417
Are you not seeing me now?

10:52.500 --> 10:55.000
I would think that you see me
every time we meet.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.125
Unless I have become translucent

10:57.208 --> 10:59.125
or, um, insubstantial

10:59.208 --> 11:01.542
and nobody has thought
to inform me until now.

11:01.625 --> 11:05.000
Then let me say I'd like
to see you in a different light.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.583
Candlelight, for instance.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.125
- Over dinner.
- Tonight?

11:08.208 --> 11:10.625
'Uh, tomorrow we maybe
involved at another crisis'

11:10.708 --> 11:12.083
'another battle.'

11:12.167 --> 11:14.583
This may be the last chance
we'll get for a while.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.417
You know, back home,
we have an old saying..

11:19.500 --> 11:21.958
"Eat, drink and be merry
for tomorrow we die."

11:22.042 --> 11:23.417
[chuckling softly]

11:23.500 --> 11:26.333
Humans can be
a very depressing people.

11:26.417 --> 11:28.583
Only if we get turned down
for dinner.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.875
Well, we cannot have that,
now, can we?

11:39.833 --> 11:40.958
[doorbell chiming]

11:43.667 --> 11:44.750
[doorbell chiming]

11:45.833 --> 11:46.875
Come!

11:46.958 --> 11:48.042
[door whirring]

11:49.500 --> 11:50.958
Londo.

11:51.042 --> 11:53.542
Ah, greetings, Vir.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.625
How was your flight?

11:55.708 --> 11:58.375
Very good. I managed
to get some sleep this time.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.750
And how are things
at the royal court?

12:00.833 --> 12:04.125
Oh, you know,
collusion, politicking

12:04.208 --> 12:06.833
scheming, innuendo, gossip..

12:06.917 --> 12:09.208
- Same old thing.
- Good, good.

12:09.292 --> 12:10.708
Oh, and your reports?

12:10.792 --> 12:13.958
- I assume they went over well?
- Yes, uh, very well.

12:14.042 --> 12:15.958
Well, did you tell them
I helped you with your reports?

12:16.042 --> 12:18.875
Oh, there was no need to.
They noticed it right off.

12:18.958 --> 12:21.125
Ah. Well, good.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.292
Good.

12:24.375 --> 12:27.083
Anything interesting happened
while you were there?

12:27.167 --> 12:28.167
No.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.958
N-not a.. No, nothing.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.917
N-no.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.958
- Vir.
- Yes.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.375
I have a surprise for you.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.750
A surprise?

12:43.250 --> 12:44.750
You can come out now.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.542
[Londo laughing]

12:55.042 --> 12:56.875
Hello, Vir.

12:56.958 --> 12:59.000
Is it not glorious, Vir?

12:59.083 --> 13:02.500
Your wife has come all this way
just to see you.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.542
- Londo, I'm not married.
- No, not yet.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.375
But in a few days, you will be.

13:08.458 --> 13:11.542
And if you ask me,
she's far too good for you.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.375
Alright. Come on, Vir.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.042
Say hello.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.875
Her name is Lyndisty,
and you will be spending

13:18.958 --> 13:21.083
the rest of your life with her.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.708
(Vir)
'How can we be married?
I've never even met you before.'

13:32.792 --> 13:34.792
It was all arranged
through your uncle

13:34.875 --> 13:37.042
and my mother,
the Lady Drusella.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.292
'They feel it would be
a perfect union'

13:39.375 --> 13:40.792
'of our two houses.'

13:40.875 --> 13:43.375
You know nothing about me.

13:43.458 --> 13:47.042
I know that you are now
the liaison to Minbar.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.708
I know that your reports

13:48.792 --> 13:50.542
are in favor
at the royal court

13:50.625 --> 13:54.125
and that your star
seems to be in ascendance.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.500
'I know that in your face'

13:55.583 --> 13:57.583
'I see a gentleness'

13:57.667 --> 13:59.750
'and a kindness of spirit.'

14:00.833 --> 14:02.417
While I was waiting for you

14:02.500 --> 14:06.167
Ambassador Mollari told me
everything about you.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.958
(Mollari)
'Oh, don't worry, Vir.'

14:08.042 --> 14:10.000
I only told her
the good parts.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.167
It was a very short
conversation.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.417
[insects screeching]

14:13.500 --> 14:14.583
[chuckling softly]

14:14.667 --> 14:16.000
[thudding]

14:16.083 --> 14:17.292
Duh.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.083
They're getting faster.

14:19.167 --> 14:22.042
I swear they are evolving
right before my eyes.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.833
If you see something this big

14:26.917 --> 14:29.917
with eight legs coming your way,
let me know.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.958
I have to kill it before
it develops language skills.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.625
When I marry,
I want it to be for love.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.125
Oh, a radical.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.458
I'm sorry, that's just
the way that I feel.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.500
If you give me a chance,
I promise you

14:46.583 --> 14:50.292
when we cross beneath
the swords and boughs

14:50.375 --> 14:51.917
it will be for love.

14:56.875 --> 14:57.917
[door whirring]

14:59.958 --> 15:01.708
Good afternoon, Sergeant Allan.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.083
- Commander.
- Here you go.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.375
Don't usually see you up here.

15:05.458 --> 15:08.583
No. I, uh, hardly ever
get the chance.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.875
Whoa.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.208
It's quite a view, isn't it?

15:12.292 --> 15:15.167
I know. I can never
get enough of it.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.042
Standing here in front
of the stars like this

15:18.625 --> 15:19.917
looking out

15:20.000 --> 15:22.708
down, up, all at once.

15:22.792 --> 15:26.667
Kind of makes you feel naked
in front of the universe.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.083
[clearing throat]
Was there something that
I could do for you, sergeant?

15:29.167 --> 15:32.250
Oh, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.750
I was gonna run this
by the chief

15:33.833 --> 15:35.417
but this is more your area
than his.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.167
We've had a lot more Narns
than usual

15:37.250 --> 15:38.333
come through here lately.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.667
Most of them
escaping the homeworld.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.375
Well, so far,
I don't see a problem.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.542
The more they can get away
from the Centauri, the better.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.792
No, hey. I agree.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.958
It's just that I was going over
their papers of transit

15:48.042 --> 15:52.292
and I noticed the name of the
Centauri who approved them.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.167
"Abrahamo Lincolni"?
You gotta be kidding me.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.500
Since when is that
a Centauri name?

15:55.583 --> 15:57.500
Yeah, well,
that was my reaction, too.

15:57.583 --> 16:03.625
Let me see that. Whose office
did these come through?

16:03.708 --> 16:05.125
'Ah!'

16:05.208 --> 16:07.375
(Vir)
'So, what did my uncle
tell you about me?'

16:07.458 --> 16:10.792
Oh, that you were smarter
than you appeared

16:10.875 --> 16:13.167
and that you had
several virtues

16:13.250 --> 16:16.000
but that I should not
hold this against you.

16:16.083 --> 16:19.625
He said that you were capable
of a quite enchanting

16:19.708 --> 16:22.125
and well-deserved humility.

16:22.208 --> 16:24.083
I'm not entirely sure
what he meant by that

16:24.167 --> 16:25.500
but I'm sure it was good.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.667
[chuckling softly]

16:28.292 --> 16:31.167
Do you think it will take you
very long to love me?

16:33.750 --> 16:36.542
You know,
it's-it's really hard to say.

16:36.625 --> 16:40.208
I've always considered time
to be very important.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.750
I've often thought
that when we are born

16:42.833 --> 16:46.417
we are given time
in a multitude of tiny boxes..

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
...so small that
when we need them most

16:48.583 --> 16:50.125
they're nowhere to be found.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.458
I-I don't think
we should rush things.

16:53.542 --> 16:56.708
You know, y-you may find
I-I'm not suited to you.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.167
Perhaps.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.000
But we will grow together.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.083
You shall be
the logical conclusion

17:04.167 --> 17:06.083
to all my happy thoughts.

17:06.167 --> 17:07.750
And the borders of my world

17:07.833 --> 17:10.375
circumscribed by your two arms.

17:13.292 --> 17:16.833
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- Oh, yes.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.167
Deliriously.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.500
But I always associated
delirium with fever

17:21.583 --> 17:23.000
so, there you are.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.375
Then let me be a fever
from which you never recover

17:26.458 --> 17:28.625
and our night's
an anarchy of pleasure.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.833
Lyndist..

17:40.042 --> 17:41.125
[moaning softly]

17:44.875 --> 17:45.917
Well?

17:47.208 --> 17:49.125
I-if kisses could kill

17:49.208 --> 17:52.000
that one would have flattened
several small towns.

17:53.042 --> 17:54.000
Vir.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.500
Our marriage has already
been arranged.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.875
The ceremony is just for show.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.625
Everything that must be done
has been done.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.625
Except between us.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.500
If you send me away
I will still be your wife

18:09.583 --> 18:12.667
in name, if not in fact.

18:12.750 --> 18:16.167
And I think you will find me
a most pleasant fact.

18:26.042 --> 18:27.500
Mr. Cotto, you're late.

18:27.583 --> 18:30.042
I'm sorry.
I was otherwise engaged.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.000
But engaged and married,
as it is.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.208
Not that I knew about it
or anythi--

18:33.292 --> 18:34.917
You're not making sense.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.875
I imagine I'm not, but that's
the kind of day I'm having.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.500
So let me-let me tell you
the reason

18:39.583 --> 18:40.542
why I'm here to talk to you.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.958
Abrahamo Lincolni?

18:43.042 --> 18:46.000
I was hoping to tell you before
you found out about it yourself.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.375
Too late.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.708
We noticed that
the papers of transit

18:49.792 --> 18:51.833
came from your office
on Minbar.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.208
Considering you're the only
person there

18:53.292 --> 18:54.458
who knows much about Earth
history

18:54.542 --> 18:56.458
I figured you must be
responsible.

18:56.542 --> 18:59.958
Now, would you like to tell me
what this is all about?

19:00.042 --> 19:02.917
I needed a name
to put on the papers.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.208
I don't have the authority
to approve transfers

19:05.292 --> 19:08.833
from the Narn homeworld,
so I invented somebody who did.

19:08.917 --> 19:11.375
'I-it's part of our
work program back home.'

19:11.458 --> 19:13.083
We bring Narns
from their homeworld

19:13.167 --> 19:16.042
to work in construction
and help in the factories.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.417
- Work camps.
- 'In a sense.'

19:18.500 --> 19:20.792
It's much better
than being back on Narn.

19:20.875 --> 19:23.583
The conditions there are
very bad, I'm told.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.500
You say these Narns
go voluntarily?

19:25.583 --> 19:27.042
Absolutely. Yes.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.917
Well, then why the forgery,
the fake names

19:29.000 --> 19:30.458
and falsified transit papers?

19:30.542 --> 19:33.042
There are many Centauri who
would rather see the Narns

19:33.125 --> 19:36.000
suffer back home than be given
comfortable quarters

19:36.083 --> 19:38.417
too close to Centauri Prime.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
We're trying to help
in our own way.

19:43.375 --> 19:46.208
(John)
'I hope that's
the right kind of table.'

19:46.292 --> 19:47.833
'I don't do a lot
of entertaining here.'

19:47.917 --> 19:51.875
I usually just grab
a bite on my way in.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.667
(Delenn)
'It's fine.'

19:53.750 --> 19:55.375
I didn't come for the decor.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.833
Well, I hope you didn't come
for the cuisine, either

19:57.917 --> 20:00.417
because unlike Mr. Garibaldi

20:00.500 --> 20:03.333
I am not exactly
a gourmet cook.

20:03.417 --> 20:04.333
[sighing]

20:04.417 --> 20:08.000
But what I lack in finesse

20:08.083 --> 20:10.750
I make up in..

20:10.833 --> 20:11.792
...portions.

20:11.875 --> 20:12.917
[chuckling]

20:13.000 --> 20:16.292
Uh, barely edible,
but lots of it.

20:16.375 --> 20:17.958
- Flarn.
- Yeah.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.500
You learned to cook flarn?

20:19.583 --> 20:21.417
Well, after I tried it
at your place

20:21.500 --> 20:23.000
I found I kinda liked it.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.375
[both chuckling]

20:24.458 --> 20:26.625
Um, it might need
a little salt.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.750
Stop apologizing.
Let's sit and eat.

20:29.833 --> 20:33.042
I'm sorry. I just wanna
make sure it's okay.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.792
Oh, it looks fine.

20:36.542 --> 20:37.667
[clearing throat]

20:41.542 --> 20:43.542
[sighing]

20:52.250 --> 20:55.917
Um. I, I like that picture
over there.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.083
Oh, yeah, that's..

20:59.167 --> 21:00.792
...that's a favorite of mine,
too.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.000
'So..'

21:07.083 --> 21:08.208
...how is the flarn?

21:09.333 --> 21:10.417
'Enough salt?'

21:11.458 --> 21:13.250
- Just right.
- Good.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.167
[door whirring]

21:18.417 --> 21:20.083
Vir! There you are.

21:20.167 --> 21:21.667
I've been looking for you.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.250
But did your meeting
with the commander go well?

21:24.333 --> 21:26.750
As well as could be expected.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.042
Is there a problem?

21:28.125 --> 21:29.917
I'd like to know more
about what you do

21:30.000 --> 21:31.958
so that I can be a good wife
to you.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.625
I knew if I followed you
long enough

21:35.708 --> 21:37.500
I would find the murderer.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.542
- Vir!
- Get behind me.

21:39.625 --> 21:40.750
Look, I don't know what you..

21:40.833 --> 21:42.792
[screaming]

21:42.875 --> 21:45.917
[dramatic music]

21:46.958 --> 21:48.625
You really did like it.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.542
(woman on radio)
'Security to all personnel
near green two.'

21:50.625 --> 21:52.042
'We've got an assault
in process.'

21:52.125 --> 21:55.083
'Repeat. Assault in process.
Green 2.'

21:55.167 --> 21:58.250
Just one level down
near Londo's quarters.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.083
I'll be right back.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.042
[both grunting]

22:02.125 --> 22:03.208
No, Vir!

22:03.292 --> 22:05.042
- Vir.
- Lyndisty, run!

22:05.125 --> 22:06.542
No, not without you.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.167
[grunting]

22:10.458 --> 22:11.500
[groaning]

22:16.958 --> 22:18.000
[groaning]

22:18.625 --> 22:19.583
Oh, my..

22:19.667 --> 22:21.750
Put it down! Now!

22:21.833 --> 22:23.583
Ragatsa Shon-kar!

22:23.667 --> 22:24.708
[zapping]

22:38.625 --> 22:39.917
And Vir had no explanation
for the attack?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.917
(John)
'None.'

22:42.000 --> 22:43.833
He said it was
a complete mystery.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.417
Well, maybe it was just a random
terrorist attack at a Centauri.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.167
It's not like they
need a reason these days.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.625
(John)
'I'm not so sure.'

22:49.708 --> 22:51.542
'Just before he came at them
the last time'

22:51.625 --> 22:53.208
"Shon-kar".

22:53.292 --> 22:54.833
Shon-kar?

22:54.917 --> 22:56.083
That's a Narn blood oath.

22:56.167 --> 22:59.292
Exactly. Meaning it's a personal
grudge.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.542
'I can't imagine why anyone'

23:00.625 --> 23:02.542
'would wanna kill
someone like Vir.'

23:02.625 --> 23:04.792
But you better run a check
on the Narn, anyway.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.125
'See what you can dig up.'

23:07.208 --> 23:09.625
Will do.
You take care of that arm.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.208
(Vir)
'I just don't understand it.'

23:11.292 --> 23:13.458
Every time I show
my face around here lately

23:13.542 --> 23:14.792
somebody hits me.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.458
First, G'Kar, then the riots.
Now this.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.375
So brave of you.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.417
Putting yourself
in front of me like that.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.042
Even terrified.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.917
I'm so proud of you.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.333
I-I just don't understand
why he did it.

23:29.417 --> 23:31.333
With the Narns, who can say?

23:31.417 --> 23:32.583
You know how they are.

23:32.667 --> 23:35.625
- Yeah, but he, uh--
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

23:35.708 --> 23:37.375
You rest now.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.542
You've earned it.

23:42.792 --> 23:45.125
You've been the hero
long enough today.

23:47.750 --> 23:49.667
I've never been a hero before.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.208
I won't let them hurt you,
Lyndisty.

23:55.292 --> 23:56.417
I promise.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.500
Bad news, Vir. We think there
may be an other Narn out

24:01.583 --> 24:03.958
to finish what the first one
started.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.583
What? How can you be sure?

24:06.667 --> 24:09.208
We checked the ID
on the Narn who attacked you.

24:09.292 --> 24:11.625
He arrived here
with his pouch brother.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.667
is a blood oath.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.458
If one family member
fails to carry it out

24:15.542 --> 24:17.542
'it devolves into
the next in line.'

24:17.625 --> 24:20.875
Vir, if a Narn declares
a blood oath

24:20.958 --> 24:23.458
there's usually
a damn good reason.

24:23.542 --> 24:25.292
Is there anything
you haven't told me?

24:25.375 --> 24:26.958
No. No, nothing.

24:27.042 --> 24:29.417
I heard there was a woman
was with you. Is she alright?

24:29.500 --> 24:31.583
Yes, uh, Lyndisty. My wife.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.250
'Well, soon to be.'

24:33.333 --> 24:36.042
You know, it-it's done,
but it's not really done.

24:36.125 --> 24:40.208
But, uh, you know,
it's a, it's a long, long story.

24:40.292 --> 24:42.542
But, you know, at first,
you know, I didn't think

24:42.625 --> 24:45.125
but now, well, she's, well..

24:45.208 --> 24:47.625
You know what, can I ask you a
question as long as you're here?

24:47.708 --> 24:49.708
Um...I suppose.

24:49.792 --> 24:50.958
Okay.

24:51.042 --> 24:54.833
What do women want
when things get, um

24:54.917 --> 24:56.958
you know, uh, um..

24:57.042 --> 24:58.125
...intimate, you know?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.500
Um..

25:01.583 --> 25:02.875
I-I really don't think that

25:02.958 --> 25:05.833
that we should be having
this conversation, Vir.

25:05.917 --> 25:08.958
I mean, I..
Isn't there someone else?

25:09.042 --> 25:11.750
There's-there's only Londo, but
I don't think that's a good idea

25:11.833 --> 25:14.500
and since, you know,
you're a woman

25:14.583 --> 25:16.083
I thought maybe
you might have some ideas.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.292
Well, I mean, it depends.
I mean..

25:18.375 --> 25:20.042
There's no single answer
to that, Vir.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.125
I mean,
every woman is different.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.083
But, uh, i-if she's your wife

25:23.167 --> 25:27.083
well, you, you must know
a-a few things about her.

25:27.167 --> 25:28.958
Blank slate.

25:29.042 --> 25:31.667
Oh. Well, um..

25:31.750 --> 25:35.250
Well, there must have been other
women before this.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.958
There were other women,
but I never got past one.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.083
You mean first base.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.333
(Vir)
'No, no. I-I mean one.'

25:43.417 --> 25:46.250
You see, we have six, uh..

25:47.583 --> 25:48.667
We have six, you see

25:48.750 --> 25:50.458
and each one
is a different level

25:50.542 --> 25:52.208
of intimacy and pleasure.

25:52.292 --> 25:54.875
'So, you know,
first you have one and that's..

25:54.958 --> 25:56.750
Yeah, you know..
And then there's two

25:56.833 --> 25:58.083
and then by the time you get to
five, it's a..

25:58.167 --> 25:59.458
[breathing heavily]

25:59.542 --> 26:01.958
Uh-uh, Vir, I got it,
I got, I got it. Okay.

26:02.042 --> 26:05.750
Uh, I-I really don't know
what to tell you, Vir.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.167
I mean..

26:07.250 --> 26:11.125
...I've never really gotten
this relationship thing

26:11.208 --> 26:12.458
down myself, okay?

26:12.542 --> 26:13.792
So I-I'm the last person
in the world

26:13.875 --> 26:16.542
who should be giving out
advice on..

26:16.625 --> 26:18.292
...on this sort of thing.

26:18.375 --> 26:20.500
'All I can say is..'

26:20.583 --> 26:22.750
...that enthusiasm

26:22.833 --> 26:24.542
sincerity, uh

26:24.625 --> 26:26.583
genuine compassion

26:26.667 --> 26:27.958
and humor

26:28.042 --> 26:31.417
can carry you through
any lack of

26:32.583 --> 26:34.500
prior experience with..

26:35.917 --> 26:37.292
...high numerical value.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.500
Wow.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.333
I'm gonna remember that.

26:43.417 --> 26:44.333
Thank you.

26:44.417 --> 26:45.583
Thank you.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.042
[sighing]

26:50.583 --> 26:52.250
[inhaling deeply]

26:52.333 --> 26:53.833
Six.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.000
[exhaling sharply]

26:55.083 --> 26:56.167
[slamming hand]

26:57.958 --> 26:59.292
[doorbell chiming]

26:59.375 --> 27:00.333
Come.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.125
[door whirring]

27:02.208 --> 27:04.667
I wanted to see
how you are doing.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.833
Ah, I've had worse.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.833
I'm just sorry it
interrupted our dinner.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.042
There will be other dinners

27:12.125 --> 27:13.875
but if you keep doing this

27:13.958 --> 27:15.542
you will get killed
one of these days.

27:15.625 --> 27:18.167
And then there'll be
no more dinners.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.208
It was happening
right under my feet.

27:20.292 --> 27:21.750
I had to do something.

27:21.833 --> 27:23.292
[chuckling softly]

27:23.375 --> 27:25.375
Besides, I-I'm-I'm fine.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.917
- Ow.
- Let me.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.375
Mmm! No, uh, Delenn-Delenn.

27:29.458 --> 27:32.458
Listen, I have been dressing
myself for a long time now.

27:32.542 --> 27:36.000
Yes, but your arm is hurt
and why put more strain on it?

27:37.875 --> 27:40.250
I hear that when it happened

27:40.333 --> 27:42.125
Vir was with a woman.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.750
Apparently,
they're to be married soon.

27:44.833 --> 27:47.042
So, I understand.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.083
Must be the shortest courtship
on record.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.625
She just got here yesterday.

27:50.708 --> 27:53.917
Perhaps you should check
the air recycling system.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.500
It may be as you say..

27:56.583 --> 27:58.125
...something in the air.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.458
Maybe there is at that.

28:10.833 --> 28:11.792
(Susan)
'Captain, I..'

28:11.875 --> 28:13.333
Oh. I-I'm sorry, I-I..

28:13.417 --> 28:15.250
- No, no.
- I didn't-I didn't mean to.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.292
It's alright. It's alright.
Um, what is it?

28:17.375 --> 28:19.583
I think you'd better meet me
in Londo's quarters, ASAP.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.875
It turns out we've got
a serious problem with Vir.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.042
On my way.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.083
[chuckling]

28:27.833 --> 28:29.667
I have to..

28:29.750 --> 28:30.792
I know.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.417
- Of course.
- Um..

28:35.500 --> 28:36.542
I should go.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.833
[chuckling]

28:41.042 --> 28:42.208
[door whirring]

28:42.292 --> 28:43.708
(Londo)
'I hope there's a good reason'

28:43.792 --> 28:45.583
'for this interruption,
commander.'

28:45.667 --> 28:47.042
(Susan)
'There is.'

28:47.125 --> 28:48.583
In the course of our
investigation

28:48.667 --> 28:50.125
into the attack yesterday
we've learned something

28:50.208 --> 28:51.625
very disturbing.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.250
Over the past couple of months

28:53.333 --> 28:54.917
Vir has been forging
travel papers

28:55.000 --> 28:56.958
for as many as 2,000 Narns

28:57.042 --> 28:58.667
authorizing them
to leave their homeworld

28:58.750 --> 29:01.125
for so-called "work camps."

29:01.208 --> 29:02.750
- Commander!
- What?

29:02.833 --> 29:05.792
Londo, please. Don't pretend you
don't know anything about this.

29:05.875 --> 29:08.708
I don't. This is a complete
surprise to me.

29:08.792 --> 29:10.625
What makes you think I would
know anything about this?

29:10.708 --> 29:12.125
Well, for starters,
it's the kind of thing

29:12.208 --> 29:14.292
that only you
could think of, Londo.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.667
Second, there's only
one logical reason

29:16.750 --> 29:20.208
why another Narn would declare
and try and kill him.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.375
Revenge.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.208
We ran a check on all the Narns

29:25.292 --> 29:28.292
who left Narn
using Vir's travel papers.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.208
According to the transit
and relocation files

29:30.292 --> 29:33.375
every one of them,
all 2,000 Narns

29:33.458 --> 29:35.917
all of them...are dead.

29:37.583 --> 29:40.667
'That's 2,000 murders, Vir.'

29:40.750 --> 29:43.375
No wonder the Narns are after
you and anyone close to you.

29:48.250 --> 29:51.292
[dramatic music]

29:56.208 --> 29:58.625
Two thousand dead Narns.

29:58.708 --> 30:00.500
Well, it's a start.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.958
Good to see you
showing some initiative, Vir.

30:03.042 --> 30:04.583
Initiative?

30:04.667 --> 30:05.750
It's murder.

30:05.833 --> 30:08.083
You say that as if
it were a bad thing.

30:08.167 --> 30:10.458
Remember it's Narns
we're talking about here.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.333
A few dead, more or less.

30:12.417 --> 30:13.917
They're not dead!

30:16.375 --> 30:19.167
- They're not?
- They're not?

30:19.250 --> 30:22.208
Well, then you do have
some explaining to do.

30:22.292 --> 30:23.833
Can't count on anything anymore.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.292
But the records, Vir.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.750
I altered the records so nobody
would go looking for them.

30:27.833 --> 30:30.542
- Why?
- Because I had to do something.

30:32.458 --> 30:35.042
'There were females
and children.'

30:36.208 --> 30:38.250
Some of the local leaders the..

30:38.333 --> 30:40.542
...the ones who kept their
language and their beliefs

30:40.625 --> 30:43.750
most of them were injured
from us bombing their world

30:43.833 --> 30:47.208
and sending them
to forced labor camps.

30:47.292 --> 30:49.750
They weren't getting
proper treatment.

30:49.833 --> 30:52.292
If I hadn't gotten them out,
they would've died.

30:53.833 --> 30:57.458
'Instead, I...had them sent
to other worlds.'

30:57.542 --> 31:00.292
Got them medical care,
and when they were healthier

31:00.375 --> 31:02.708
I had them filtered
back here to Babylon 5

31:02.792 --> 31:04.792
or sent elsewhere.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.708
Then why do the records
say they died?

31:06.792 --> 31:09.875
Because, back home,
nobody cares about dead Narns

31:09.958 --> 31:11.750
only living ones.

31:11.833 --> 31:14.500
While I was here, there was
nothing that I could do.

31:14.583 --> 31:17.958
But while I was running
the diplomatic mission on Minbar

31:18.042 --> 31:20.667
I had the chance to do
something.

31:20.750 --> 31:23.000
And I took it.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.208
My only regret is that
I couldn't have saved

31:25.292 --> 31:26.375
more of them.

31:30.792 --> 31:33.625
Do you realize
what you have done to me, Vir?

31:33.708 --> 31:36.458
I was the one who pushed
to get you this position

31:36.542 --> 31:38.208
position you have abused.

31:38.292 --> 31:40.417
If this comes out..

31:40.500 --> 31:42.875
...the scandal
would hurt both of us.

31:42.958 --> 31:46.208
Now, I will have to deal
with this, Vir, and with you.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.958
(John)
'Just one thing.'

31:50.042 --> 31:51.292
If Vir is telling the truth

31:51.375 --> 31:53.833
and none of these Narns
have been killed

31:53.917 --> 31:55.708
why did one of them
attack him?

31:56.542 --> 31:58.625
They are Narns, captain.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.917
They don't need
a reason for murder.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.167
Ah! Vir, there you are.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.250
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.125
You're troubled.

32:13.208 --> 32:15.125
I can tell from your expression.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.958
Can you tell me
what is troubling you?

32:23.292 --> 32:26.500
I thought
I was doing something good.

32:26.583 --> 32:28.083
And I was.

32:28.167 --> 32:31.333
Only now,
it's something quite bad.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.667
For me, at least.

32:33.792 --> 32:35.500
Well, that covers effect

32:35.583 --> 32:38.375
but I'm reasonably sure
that I'm no nearer cause

32:38.458 --> 32:40.000
than I was when I sat down.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.250
It's a long story.
It has to do with the Narns.

32:43.333 --> 32:46.833
Ah, I should've expected that.

32:46.917 --> 32:50.042
Well, whatever it is, Vir, I'm
sure that it's not your fault.

32:52.958 --> 32:55.250
How can you say that?
I mean..

32:55.333 --> 32:57.875
You don't even know
what the situation is.

32:57.958 --> 32:59.375
Unnecessary.

32:59.458 --> 33:02.042
Everyone knows that
wherever there's trouble

33:02.125 --> 33:04.625
there's always a Narn
at the center of it.

33:04.708 --> 33:08.125
'That's all they are,
you know, trouble.'

33:08.208 --> 33:10.292
It's not their fault.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.542
They're simply inferior.

33:13.667 --> 33:14.750
It's genetics.

33:15.833 --> 33:16.958
They're lazy.

33:17.958 --> 33:20.792
They foul their own nests.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.083
Everything they touch
falls apart.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.292
Hence, my original conclusion.

33:26.375 --> 33:30.292
'The sooner they're dealt with
the better for everyone.'

33:30.375 --> 33:33.542
Especially if they've caused you
any kind of trouble.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.750
You don't really mean that,
do you?

33:36.833 --> 33:38.625
Yes, of course I do.

33:38.708 --> 33:41.500
My dearest Vir, don't be silly.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.042
[laughing]

33:43.125 --> 33:45.125
You're having fun with me,
aren't you?

33:45.208 --> 33:46.667
Playing with me.

33:46.750 --> 33:50.083
Well, I can play, too.
That's why I came to find you.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.833
I have something for you.

33:51.917 --> 33:53.750
- Please, come.
- I-I can't, really.

33:53.833 --> 33:54.750
I'm not in the mood.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.292
Oh, but this would cheer you up.

33:56.375 --> 33:59.250
Please, we don't have
a lot of time. Please come.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.375
Alright.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.000
[door whirring]

34:03.083 --> 34:04.625
Two steps in.

34:06.708 --> 34:07.792
And stop.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.083
You can open your eyes now.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.292
It's dark.

34:13.375 --> 34:14.917
Lights, gently, please.

34:17.917 --> 34:20.958
- Lyndisty!
- 'I knew you'd be surprised.'

34:26.958 --> 34:28.208
[groaning]

34:28.292 --> 34:29.708
He's still alive.

34:29.792 --> 34:31.583
Yes, of course!

34:31.667 --> 34:33.625
I saved him for you.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.125
I almost didn't.

34:35.208 --> 34:38.042
After all,
he did intend to kill me.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.375
But I set
a little trap for him.

34:41.458 --> 34:44.167
I have been trained
quite well.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.500
I almost finished
him all myself but--

34:46.583 --> 34:48.333
Why did he wanna kill you?

34:48.417 --> 34:51.125
At first, I wasn't sure.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.375
But then,
when he was unconscious..

34:54.833 --> 34:58.042
...I studied him
for a very long time

34:58.125 --> 35:00.792
until I remembered

35:00.875 --> 35:03.083
I saw him on Narn.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.500
My father and I went there
after the war.

35:05.583 --> 35:08.417
He was in charge
of culling the herds.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.750
"Culling the herds"?

35:09.833 --> 35:13.500
Oh, yes. Quite necessary
for pacification.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.792
He would test their villages
and find out

35:15.875 --> 35:18.417
which populations
had the greatest tendency

35:18.500 --> 35:19.833
toward aggression.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.417
You cure future aggression

35:21.500 --> 35:24.000
by cutting out
that part of the gene pool.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.417
Our soldiers would bring them in

35:27.500 --> 35:29.667
ten, twenty at a time

35:29.750 --> 35:32.042
and we'd put them to sleep.

35:32.125 --> 35:35.292
'It was more humane
than they deserved, really.'

35:35.375 --> 35:38.750
Hmm, but father's always been
overly charitable.

35:39.917 --> 35:42.292
Sometimes we'd find
whole villages

35:42.375 --> 35:45.375
where the aggression
was just too deeply rooted

35:45.458 --> 35:47.875
and we had to take it all out.

35:47.958 --> 35:50.208
'Oh, you could-you could see'

35:50.292 --> 35:52.542
'the flames rising up'

35:52.625 --> 35:55.125
'into the night like..'

35:55.208 --> 35:58.833
...brilliant flowers
embracing the spring.

35:58.917 --> 36:03.292
Bright buds opening
and spreading wider.

36:06.292 --> 36:07.750
This one..

36:07.833 --> 36:10.042
'I remember.
He escaped with his brother'

36:10.125 --> 36:12.958
'from one of the villages
we purified.'

36:13.042 --> 36:15.250
That must be why
they tried to kill me.

36:20.167 --> 36:21.958
He was going to use this.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.250
But I saved it and him

36:26.333 --> 36:27.375
for you.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.917
'As head of our new household'

36:34.000 --> 36:35.667
'it is your right.'

36:40.542 --> 36:41.875
Vir.

36:41.958 --> 36:45.500
Oh, Vir, it's not like
he's really aware.

36:45.583 --> 36:47.083
'And after the first few'

36:47.167 --> 36:49.083
'it's really quite easy.'

36:49.167 --> 36:51.583
I've done it hundreds
of times myself.

36:53.292 --> 36:54.375
Please.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.667
Accept this one

36:57.750 --> 37:01.292
as a token of my love for you..

37:01.375 --> 37:03.875
...and a testimony
of our marriage.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.375
(Londo)
'I have spent'

37:14.458 --> 37:16.500
'the last hour'

37:16.583 --> 37:19.125
on the line with certain friends
in the Centauri

37:19.208 --> 37:20.167
who owe me favors.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.417
I've not told them everything.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.792
Just what is required
for their cooperation.

37:25.875 --> 37:29.125
It is not as if this was the
first time this happened.

37:29.208 --> 37:33.583
'Oh, no. Our last envoy
to Minbar also went native.'

37:34.875 --> 37:37.250
Too much exposure to those

37:37.333 --> 37:40.792
those damn Minbari
can have strange effects.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.292
So..

37:42.375 --> 37:44.833
...we are going to pretend

37:44.917 --> 37:49.208
that this entire unfortunate
incident never took place.

37:49.292 --> 37:51.917
'All records will be destroyed.'

37:52.000 --> 37:54.333
And you are forbidden

37:54.417 --> 37:57.000
to speak about it to anyone!

37:57.083 --> 37:58.583
'Do you understand?'

38:01.875 --> 38:02.958
Good.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.542
[exhaling sharply]

38:10.625 --> 38:12.708
I must say
that I am personally

38:12.792 --> 38:14.833
very disappointed in you, Vir.

38:15.917 --> 38:17.833
'I had expected better of you.'

38:20.083 --> 38:21.458
But..

38:21.542 --> 38:25.500
...I suppose, uh, it is my own
fault as much as yours.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.875
I was foolish
in sending you to Minbar

38:27.958 --> 38:29.958
before I had finished
your training.

38:31.750 --> 38:35.292
'You fell in with bad company.'

38:35.375 --> 38:38.583
Free thinkers, anarchists,
Minbari!

38:38.667 --> 38:41.292
They took advantage
of your naivety.

38:46.083 --> 38:48.042
Well, it happens.

38:48.125 --> 38:51.250
Sometimes the bird leaves the
nest and flies away.

38:51.333 --> 38:54.250
And sometimes it falls
onto its beak

38:54.333 --> 38:57.167
and needs to be helped back
into the nest for a while.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.042
That is you.

38:59.125 --> 39:03.417
'Your tenure as our liaison
to Minbar is over.'

39:03.500 --> 39:04.875
'You'll stay here now.'

39:04.958 --> 39:08.708
Away from temptation and
the authority that you misused.

39:08.792 --> 39:10.708
And I will continue
your instruction

39:10.792 --> 39:13.000
in what it means to be Centauri.

39:15.208 --> 39:18.500
'You can start
by telling your wife goodbye.'

39:19.583 --> 39:22.167
Lyndisty? What happened?

39:22.250 --> 39:23.917
- Do her parents know?
- No, no.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.750
They,
they only know that there's been

39:25.833 --> 39:29.250
some kind of
unfortunate misunderstanding

39:29.333 --> 39:31.292
and that your place
is not as high as it was

39:31.375 --> 39:33.125
a few days ago.

39:33.208 --> 39:34.792
They have not canceled
the marriage

39:34.875 --> 39:37.625
but they are reconsidering
it for a while.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.125
I suggest you go
and make up to her

39:40.208 --> 39:42.542
as best as you can.

39:42.625 --> 39:43.958
She's a good woman.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.667
A true Centauri.

39:49.458 --> 39:51.875
[sighing]
That she is.

39:51.958 --> 39:53.042
[door whirring]

39:57.708 --> 39:59.125
Good morning, commander.

39:59.208 --> 40:01.333
Captain.

40:01.417 --> 40:03.458
(John)
'Uh, something
I can do for you?'

40:03.542 --> 40:05.667
Uh, this is my office,
after all.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.625
I know, I was just using
your security clearances

40:07.708 --> 40:08.958
to finish up a few things.

40:09.042 --> 40:11.333
Ah, such as?

40:11.417 --> 40:12.292
[sighing]

40:12.375 --> 40:14.375
Getting rid of some bad dreams.

40:14.458 --> 40:15.500
What?

40:17.500 --> 40:18.958
Alright.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.250
What do you think?

40:21.250 --> 40:23.333
That's me as a Centauri.

40:23.417 --> 40:24.333
(Susan)
'Nope.'

40:24.417 --> 40:26.667
'That's Abrahamo Lincolni'

40:26.750 --> 40:28.875
'of the Centauri
Relocation Bureau.'

40:28.958 --> 40:30.958
Vir did a very good job
creating a fake bureaucrat.

40:31.042 --> 40:32.875
Londo doesn't know about him
and he's still authorized

40:32.958 --> 40:34.250
to issue travel papers.

40:34.333 --> 40:36.333
So, I figured,
why not take advantage of it?

40:36.417 --> 40:37.958
'Keep him around for a while.'

40:38.042 --> 40:39.125
So, I added a few details.

40:39.208 --> 40:42.208
A photo from your file.

40:42.292 --> 40:44.042
Yeah, I've noticed.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.792
I'm not sure I like the coat.

40:46.875 --> 40:49.125
So how many Narns
do you think old Lincolni here

40:49.208 --> 40:52.833
can get out of danger before the
Centauri figure it out?

40:52.917 --> 40:56.583
Beats me. But it seems like even
one would be a victory.

40:56.667 --> 40:58.375
What does this have to do
with your dreams?

40:58.458 --> 41:00.042
(Susan)
'I just realized that I was'

41:00.125 --> 41:03.583
looking for a direction
of some kind.

41:03.667 --> 41:05.542
I mean, something to do
for the station or for us.

41:05.625 --> 41:08.875
I mean, ever since we broke away
I've been mostly parking ships

41:08.958 --> 41:10.500
and running inventories.

41:10.583 --> 41:12.375
You know, but operating
behind the scenes

41:12.458 --> 41:14.542
running numbers like this,
using our resources

41:14.625 --> 41:16.083
to help other races, I..

41:16.167 --> 41:18.792
I feel like I've got some
new options now.

41:18.875 --> 41:22.375
And to tell you the truth, I,
I hate to say this but, uh..

41:22.458 --> 41:24.875
I think I'd really enjoy
being a sneak.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.208
Then I hereby appoint you

41:26.292 --> 41:29.375
the official Babylon 5
sneak-in-residence.

41:29.458 --> 41:30.583
Well, thank you.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.042
Now, get the hell out
of my chair.

41:32.125 --> 41:34.167
Yes, sir!

41:34.250 --> 41:37.625
And may I say, sir,
from the bottom of my heart

41:37.708 --> 41:40.542
that you make an absolutely
charming Centauri.

41:46.167 --> 41:51.042
I-I know we had some problems
towards the end there

41:51.125 --> 41:55.208
and I definitely think
we need to talk about it.

41:55.292 --> 41:57.958
But I think you can change.

41:58.042 --> 42:02.458
It's some of your ideas
they need...rehabilitation.

42:02.542 --> 42:04.458
They say the same about you.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.250
They say that you are confused

42:06.333 --> 42:08.750
but that you will get better
in time.

42:08.833 --> 42:10.500
Oh, I hope not.

42:10.583 --> 42:14.167
Well, either way,
I will wait for you.

42:14.250 --> 42:18.875
- You don't have to do that.
- No, but I will.

42:18.958 --> 42:23.083
So, I take your gentle face
with me

42:23.167 --> 42:27.583
transmuted into memory
by the alchemy of my affection

42:27.667 --> 42:30.167
as deposit on our wedding night.

42:32.375 --> 42:35.333
[instrumental music]

42:39.875 --> 42:42.458
I will see you again, Vir.

42:42.542 --> 42:43.583
Soon.

42:48.958 --> 42:50.042
[exhaling deeply]

42:51.042 --> 42:52.375
Well..

42:52.458 --> 42:55.083
What relationships
don't have their ups and downs?

43:02.042 --> 43:04.417
[theme music]

43:31.250 --> 43:33.125
[music continues]

43:33.750 --> 43:36.125
[theme music]

44:02.958 --> 44:06.000
[music continues]
