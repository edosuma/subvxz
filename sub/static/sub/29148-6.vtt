We could've been doing this
every weekend.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.889
It's so peaceful.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.392
You know what else is peaceful?
The spa at the Sands.

01:42.185 --> 01:46.981
Debbie, [chuckles] look around
and take in the natural beauty.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.983

-We went camping all the time growing up.
-[Melrose] She keeps talking and talking.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.375

I'm not gonna be here forever, you know.

I don't know how many Passovers
I have left to host,

a black belt in guilt jujitsu.

Stop what? Talking about myself?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.273
No, I can't. You know that.

Jenny, lighten up.
Let me help you carry something.

that you're stayin'
in Vegas for the rest of the year?

02:52.922 --> 02:54.174
Nope, not yet.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.593
Shit. [chuckles] You really know
how to help people

02:56.676 --> 02:59.095
-take their mind off things.
-[chuckles]

02:59.762 --> 03:00.889
It's part of my charm.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.516
All right, so, um,
who's gonna be the bad guy here?

03:03.641 --> 03:07.604
'Cause, um, Tammé, she can't grin
and bear it for another nine months.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.857

03:35.757 --> 03:38.760
Well, there is a...

03:39.510 --> 03:42.388
moderate sports course that's six miles...

03:42.472 --> 03:43.389
[Stacey] No way.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.474
-No, no.
-[all clamor]

-[chuckles]

03:47.936 --> 03:49.896
My heart says it's a definite miss.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.734
If you don't want to hike,
you can hang back and start dinner.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.361
-Great.
-Or make a fire.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.779
This is not a dictatorship.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.448
Unless you're gonna start tellin' us
what to do now.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.245
Uh, I'll just stay and make a fire.

Nobody? I... That...

04:16.464 --> 04:18.091
I... saw that.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.093
And then there were four.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.721
-Are you gonna hike?
-Yeah. I... I need the exercise.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.934
And, yeah, you know,
one last hurrah before I pack it in.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.477
Pack what in?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.063
Um, I can't do a whole year in Vegas,

04:32.146 --> 04:34.691
so I'm gonna go home to Randy
and collect my checks.

he can have it.

-[Sheila panting]
-You're competitive. I like it.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.408
Always have been.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.243
You ever play any sports?

04:45.326 --> 04:48.955
No. I did Outward Bound when I was a kid,
for my anger issues.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.790
-Did it help you?
-Not really.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.041
[laughs]

04:52.292 --> 04:54.961
Water. You gotta stay hydrated
in 90-degree heat.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.880
Oh, don't worry about me. I can keep up.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.465
Cool. Let's push it.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.218
I'd like to get to the top
while it's still light out.

05:08.057 --> 05:08.975

05:09.642 --> 05:11.644
that's it? You're... done?

05:12.478 --> 05:16.482
Oh, Ruth, I'm not gonna commute
for an entire year of Randy's life.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.026
He's not gonna know who I am.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.028
Come on, you've been doin' so great.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.656
You're like a superhero,
flyin' back and forth.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.616
You know I missed him walking?

05:26.075 --> 05:27.577
Hm. I'm missing everything.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.539
So, do fewer shows.
I can cover Liberty Bell, and-- and...

05:31.706 --> 05:33.958
[chuckles]
...Sheila can do Zoya on your off nights--

05:34.042 --> 05:37.170
No, it was a crazy plan to begin with,
and Mark went with it

05:37.253 --> 05:40.506
because... he owes me
for the rest of his natural life.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.886
But, uh, you know, he's not gonna roll
with this schedule for a full year.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.637
And, you know, I don't wanna ask him,

05:46.721 --> 05:50.475
because I need some goodwill on reserve
for... ten years down the line

05:50.558 --> 05:53.311
when I get a movie in Japan and...

05:53.394 --> 05:55.605
I don't know,
I want to put Randy in school there.

05:55.688 --> 05:59.192
Oh, my God! I just hate all of them.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.194
You hate the Japanese?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.196
Men.

06:03.571 --> 06:07.241
I, uh, hate men. Mark, Bash...

Even when I'm fucking
the cute young ones, I just...

06:09.911 --> 06:11.204
I like to take my hand

06:11.496 --> 06:14.624
and just, pfft, crunch their face
into the pillow,

06:14.707 --> 06:17.335
just hard,
because they are just so...

06:17.668 --> 06:18.586
[exhales]

06:18.836 --> 06:19.670
...free.

06:20.546 --> 06:21.881
They make the choices.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.549
They dictate the terms,

06:23.633 --> 06:26.803
and I just hate asking them for anything.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.472
What's going-- What are you doing?
Are you tryin' to find a place to pee?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.307
No, I need a walking stick.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.937
Well, we're in the desert, not the woods.
You're not gonna find a stick.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.441
-Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh! [exclaims]
-[both chuckle]

06:41.234 --> 06:44.278
You don't find a walking stick.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.989
-It finds you.
-Mm.

06:47.156 --> 06:51.077
[takes a deep breath, clicks tongue]
Where are, uh, Reggie and Sheila?

06:52.537 --> 06:53.871
-Where are we?
-[eagle screeches]

06:53.955 --> 06:57.333
[Debbie] Um... [clicks tongue]
Let me see the map for one second.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.918
[Ruth] Oh, they have the map.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.796
What? Trail leader gets the map.

07:01.879 --> 07:05.967
I-- I'm sure if we keep going,
we'll bump into them. And if not,

07:07.135 --> 07:10.888
we'll let the stars guide us.
[breathes deeply]

07:11.556 --> 07:13.391
You've never been camping, have you?

07:14.016 --> 07:16.769
We spent summers at Lake Okoboji.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.689
There were cabins.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.362
-[Melrose] Oh, God.
-[footsteps approaching]

07:36.122 --> 07:38.124
Don't tell Cherry I'm this out of shape.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.460
Oh, God.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.378
Okay...

07:49.135 --> 07:51.012
Okay, you know I hate
when people are mad at me,

07:51.095 --> 07:53.097
so can you just spit it out?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.184
I have nothing to say to you.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.935
Well, clearly you do.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.981
So, can you at least ignore me out loud

08:02.064 --> 08:05.109
instead of pretending you're having
an existential epiphany

08:05.193 --> 08:07.361
two minutes after we get
to the fuckin' desert?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.656
[Jenny sighs]

08:11.282 --> 08:12.492
[sighs]

08:15.912 --> 08:17.538
Every night,

08:18.915 --> 08:20.416
I put on a kimono

08:20.917 --> 08:22.919
to jump out of a fortune cookie

08:23.461 --> 08:25.171
at an Asian-themed hotel,

08:25.254 --> 08:28.466
surrounded by white geishas serving
mai tais.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.094
-[sighs]
-And?

08:32.637 --> 08:33.763
And...

08:34.222 --> 08:37.433
What do you mean, "And?"
It's like I'm living in a nightmare.

08:37.975 --> 08:38.893
It sucks.

08:40.436 --> 08:41.938
Sorry, what does this have to do with me?

[in exaggerated accent]
"Soy sauce in your eye!

-Oh, come on!

08:47.109 --> 08:48.861
I wasn't doing an impression of you.

08:49.237 --> 08:53.032
I was doing you doing a racist character.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.867
But you're white.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.537
Don't look at me like that!
We're best friends.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.997
I'm not,
like, some fucking random white girl.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.834
Wow, you really do not understand.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.170
No, Jenny, I don't.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.257
I did a gag one time at a wrestling show.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.134
I mean, no one even fucking noticed.
Jesus Christ.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.470
If you're gonna sit up here
pretending to be like Buddha

09:14.554 --> 09:18.933
on the mountain,
[inhales] you gotta relax. Okay?

09:19.016 --> 09:20.434
We're on vacation.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.729
Can't we just, like,

09:24.313 --> 09:26.524
drink a fuckton of wine
and forget about it?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.443
[sighs]

09:30.987 --> 09:32.405
Don't follow me this time.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.211
Tammé!
You shouldn't be crouching over like that.

09:48.087 --> 09:48.921
Here...

09:49.005 --> 09:49.922
-[grunts]
-Oh! Okay.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.508
[groans] Shouldn't be sleeping
on the ground neither,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.719
but sounded too fun to pass up.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.262
All right, so here's the deal.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.515
Debbie's too chickenshit, so I'll say it.
We can't let you wrestle.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.643
Not now, but give me a few weeks.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.271
-It's an injury. It'll heal.
-[Cherry] And then what?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.648
You get back in the ring,
do another 400 bumps?

10:07.732 --> 10:10.484
You do the math on how many times
your back hits the mat in nine months.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.029
So, I'll do front bumps.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.072
Or play a Biddie.
That was a piece of cake.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.618
All right, may-maybe
if you go to the doctor, get a... X-ray

10:18.701 --> 10:21.329
-or a note.
-I don't do doctors. [sighs]

10:22.622 --> 10:24.040
-[sighs]
-[Tammé] Look, I got a late start

10:24.123 --> 10:25.082
as an actor.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.752
I put Ernest first for a long time.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.255
But for the first time in 20 years,

10:31.505 --> 10:34.050
I get to perform every single night.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.093
So what, my back hurts.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.055
That's nothing. That's physical.
Don't take this away from me.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.475
There's other ways you can be a performer.
Hell, we're in Vegas.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.019
Oh, go try comedy.
You love making people laugh.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.520
Sure.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.899
Lots of clubs are looking for black women
with no experience in their 40s.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.526
Better than being a black woman
in her 40s who can't walk.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.569
[sighs]

10:53.653 --> 10:56.322
You want to attend Ernest's wedding
in a wheelchair?

10:56.530 --> 10:57.657
Sure, as long as I'm there.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.369
[chuckles] Ooh, you's a stubborn one.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.454
Carmen! Carmen gon' tell you

11:03.537 --> 11:05.456
-how crazy you sound.
-[sighs]

11:05.539 --> 11:06.874
[Cherry] You know a lot of wrestlers,
right?

11:07.541 --> 11:08.793
[chuckles] Yeah.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.753
And how many of them end up crippled

11:10.961 --> 11:12.421
from permanent nerve damage?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.093
[sighs]<i> </i>A lot of them.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.637
But they've been doing this for so long,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.098
and they don't go to doctors,
and they just take painkillers.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.184
So a wrestler gets an injury,
and y'all just kick him to the curb?

11:25.393 --> 11:26.560
-No.
-[sighs]

11:26.686 --> 11:29.730
Uh, some of them go on
and do other things like announcing.

11:30.272 --> 11:34.193
Ha! Good luck with prying that microphone
out of Bash's cold, dead hands.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.029
Or managing.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.198
What? Like, do the books?

11:39.573 --> 11:42.326
No, like, um, Captain Lou Albano.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.164
-Who?
-Bobby "The Brain" Heenan?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.166
Heck, you guys,

11:49.250 --> 11:52.211
Cyndi Lauper managed  Wendi Richter
at WrestleMania I,

11:52.294 --> 11:53.963
and the crowd ate it up.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.590
So, it's like a gimmick?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.719
Managers are like wrestlers
without the actual wrestling.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.638
They just pace around the ring
and cause trouble

12:02.722 --> 12:05.516
and have huge personalities,
like, um, Don King in boxing.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.477
I could do Don King.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.104
[lighter clicks]

12:16.068 --> 12:18.362
God, it feels good
to get out of the hotel.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.780
[exhales]

12:21.991 --> 12:23.075
I know.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.579
I started hearing the sound
of slot machines in my dreams.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.833
I just want 24 hours where
I don't have to pretend to be straight,

12:32.168 --> 12:34.253
flirt with Mormon dealers.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.381
-[grunts in disgust]
-Are you doing all that?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.760
Someone has to keep us safe.
[exhales]

12:42.720 --> 12:44.513
I think the hotel's safe.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.266
There's lots of security.

12:47.516 --> 12:48.768
[women laughing]

12:49.101 --> 12:50.102
Why smoke a joint

12:50.186 --> 12:52.354
-when you can smoke a whole bong?
-Hey!

12:52.438 --> 12:54.148
Whoa, party's here!

12:54.231 --> 12:56.108
Yeah. Oh, you don't know
any two-player games?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.026
[both laugh]

12:57.109 --> 12:58.194
[Stacey] Solitaire!

12:58.277 --> 13:02.072
[laughs] All right, I'm gonna cover
your metaphorical sadness with snacks.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.283
[Stacey and Yolanda laugh]

13:04.492 --> 13:06.327
Oh, I should pass this to you.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.037
-[giggles] Here.
-[Arthie] Uh...

13:08.120 --> 13:09.121
Okay.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.792
There's a cover on the back.
You just put your finger over it,

13:12.875 --> 13:16.170
lift it, smoke, lungs, boom!

13:16.253 --> 13:17.671
-[group laughs]
-[Arthie] Okay, okay.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.215
-Um...
-[Dawn laughs]

13:19.465 --> 13:21.467
-[Stacey chuckling]
-[bong bubbling]

13:23.677 --> 13:25.429
-See? She got it.
-[Stacey] Yay!

13:26.972 --> 13:27.807
[exhales and coughs]

13:27.890 --> 13:30.184
-Yay!
-There you go, baby girl!

13:31.310 --> 13:34.855
[as Ethel Rosenblatt] This reefer
is really helping with my gout.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.274
[both laughing hysterically]

13:37.358 --> 13:40.528
I like how your version of Ethel
isn't even trying to be funny.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.571
No, don't encourage her.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.989
She's been doing bits all week.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.409
Do you know how freeing it was
to play a character

13:47.493 --> 13:51.789
and not have to worry
about racial geopolitics?

13:51.872 --> 13:54.166
Oh, God, you're nuts.
I loved being Beirut.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.044
It was like getting to be
a Bond supervillain.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.172
And I didn't have to share the ring
with Edna-scenery-chewer over here.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.591
-[snickers] No offense.
-Hm.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.260
[Arthie and Stacey chuckle]

14:05.302 --> 14:07.555
We should switch, permanently.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.182
Yes. Wait, can we?

14:11.183 --> 14:13.227
-Who cares? I'm in.
-Done!

14:13.310 --> 14:14.228
Awesome!

14:14.687 --> 14:15.938
Are you ditching me?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.650
No. Well, unless you wanna be
a Biddie too.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.653
Oh, then you and Arthie
could be like old lezzies together.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.947
You know,
that would make more sense, actually.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.032
[laughs]
Wait, make more sense than...

14:27.116 --> 14:28.200
-than what?
-[bong bubbling]

14:28.284 --> 14:32.538
Well, than, like,
you and me wrestling together.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.960
Going forward, it would probably
be more comfortable with, you know,

14:39.545 --> 14:40.880
our usual partners.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.009
Oh, what she's trying to say is that,
you know,

14:45.092 --> 14:47.094
there's a lot of moves
where one person's crotch

14:47.177 --> 14:48.971
is in another person's face.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.850
I'll stick with Junkchain.

14:53.642 --> 14:54.643
Thank you.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.773
[panting] Come on, Sheila. You can do it.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.109
Push through!

15:05.029 --> 15:07.239
[panting, sniffles]

15:08.657 --> 15:09.575
[grunting]

15:15.998 --> 15:17.041
[coughs]

15:23.964 --> 15:26.592
[breathing heavily]

15:32.973 --> 15:34.975
[mystical electronic music playing]

16:13.597 --> 16:16.642
Sheila! Come see this.
What are you doing down there?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.608
Oh, my God. Sheila!

16:27.027 --> 16:28.862
[sighs] You're smothering it.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.657
-You told me to put in more wood.
-Is dinner ready yet?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.119
-We're still working on the fire.
-Well, some of us are starving.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.955
[loudly] 'Cause we smoked a lot of weed.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.168
Hey. You need any help?

16:48.257 --> 16:51.301
Rice, beans, hot dog buns...

16:51.635 --> 16:54.054
-Who planned this fucking menu, huh?
-I did.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.808
Who doesn't love a Mexican cookout?

16:58.308 --> 16:59.309
You wanna cook?

17:00.561 --> 17:01.562
Be my guest.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.319
Well,
what am I even gonna cook anything in?

17:09.653 --> 17:11.280
[Tammé laughs]

17:11.405 --> 17:13.699
None of you geniuses thought to bring
a fucking pot?

17:14.658 --> 17:16.076
I brought fucking pot.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.370
[all laugh]

17:20.622 --> 17:23.083
Oh, I think I found a trail marker!

17:23.751 --> 17:25.502
-You said that last time.
-No.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.840
This is definitely more
than a random piling of rocks.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.050
-Okay.
-Let's go this way.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.264
Oh, my God. [sighs]

17:38.057 --> 17:40.517
Let's... try the other direction.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.227
Don't worry.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.105
As long as we make it back
before it gets dark, we'll be fine.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.067
What happened to
"the stars will guide us"?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.866
Nothing here. I checked all three cars.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.912
You gonna stab me?

18:00.245 --> 18:02.498
We need a pot. How about four?

18:02.581 --> 18:05.459
What's round, metal,
and easily detachable?

18:05.584 --> 18:06.543
[Carmen scoffs]

18:06.919 --> 18:09.588
-Have you ever cooked <i>anything </i>before?
-[Melrose] No.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.801
Fueled by guilt, powerful motivator.
[grunts]

18:14.259 --> 18:17.721
[laughs]
I'm fucking good. I'm good. I'm good.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.766
Everybody!

18:21.308 --> 18:23.268
Dinner is served!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.603
[all cheering]

18:24.686 --> 18:26.897
Kind of. It's more of an amuse-bouche.
Look at it.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.440
[group laughs]

18:29.149 --> 18:30.692
[Melrose] And you guys, um...

18:31.568 --> 18:36.031
I was also thinking that, um,
since we're all together,

18:36.365 --> 18:38.909
right, and we're in the actual desert

18:39.243 --> 18:41.787
and I've already disappointed
enough people today...

18:43.539 --> 18:45.415
maybe we could do a Passover Seder.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.501
-A what?
-[Melrose] A Seder.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.087
-A what?
-Oh, it's like a Jewish dinner

18:50.170 --> 18:51.213
for friends and family.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.007
-Oh, a Seder?
-You don't know what a Seder is.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.886
It's a dinner for family and friends,
Jewish-style.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.305
[all laugh]

19:03.934 --> 19:04.893
<i>De-ver.</i>

19:05.144 --> 19:06.687
[all] <i>De-ver.</i>

19:06.895 --> 19:07.855
<i>She-heen.</i>

19:07.938 --> 19:09.273
[all] <i>She-heen.</i>

19:09.356 --> 19:10.440
[Melrose] <i>Ba-rad.</i>

19:10.524 --> 19:11.817
[all] <i>Ba-rad.</i>

19:12.025 --> 19:13.026
[Melrose] <i>Ar-beh.</i>

19:13.110 --> 19:14.069
[all] <i>Ar-beh.</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:15.654
That one means "locusts."

19:15.988 --> 19:18.740
-Oh.
-Okay, next one. <i>Cho-shech.</i>

19:18.824 --> 19:20.450
[all] <i>Cho-shech.</i>

19:20.784 --> 19:25.581
Medium. And then the last one is
<i>ma-kat bechorot.</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:27.583
[all] <i>Ma-kat bechorot.</i>

19:27.666 --> 19:30.335
Good! And that's for the slaying
of the firstborn.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.962
No, not my baby Ernest.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.589
[group laughs]

19:34.089 --> 19:38.010
So, what's crazy is that after the whole
slaying of the firstborn thing,

19:38.093 --> 19:40.345
the Pharaoh actually let the Jews go.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.890
But they had to leave so quickly
that the dough on their backs

19:42.973 --> 19:45.893
didn't have time to rise,
and that's why we have matzo.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.352
Graham crackers?

19:47.811 --> 19:50.522
-Thank you, my assistant, Dawn. Okay...
-[laughter]

19:50.939 --> 19:51.940
[Melrose clears throat]

19:52.024 --> 19:55.360
Oh, and then the Pharaoh changed his mind
because he's a power-hungry dictator

19:55.444 --> 19:57.362
terrified of losing his slaves.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.906
Oh, that sounds familiar.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.700
[both laugh]

20:01.783 --> 20:02.868
Guys, guys.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.287
Well, I don't get it. [chuckles]

20:05.537 --> 20:08.040
I think they're comparing Bash
to the Pharaoh.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.834
[Tammé giggling]

20:11.543 --> 20:12.753
He's not a dictator.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.047
-He's providing everyone jobs.
-[Yolanda] Yeah, yeah.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.840
In a slave labor kind of way.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.717
[group laughs]

20:20.928 --> 20:24.723
Okay, I don't know about any of you guys,
but last year, I was sleeping in my car.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.352
And if it wasn't for Bash
and his idea for a wrestling show,

20:28.435 --> 20:30.646
then none of us
would even be sitting here today.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.650
And I didn't hear any of you complaining
when you got your last paycheck.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.151
Or the one before that.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.654
All right, Cleopatra.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.822
Stand by your man.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.491
[group laughs]

20:42.908 --> 20:44.326
Wait, you guys get paid?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.661
-[group laughs]
-Come on!

20:49.122 --> 20:50.207
Well, Ruth,

20:50.666 --> 20:52.793
you are finally going to get your wish.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.087
We're gonna die together.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.047
[sighs]

21:01.927 --> 21:04.471
"Debbie Eagan, 32,

21:04.554 --> 21:07.891
found dead near a cluster of rocks.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.226
[inhales deeply]

21:09.434 --> 21:11.937
[exhales] She was best known
for  playing Laura Morgan

21:12.020 --> 21:13.188
on <i>Paradise Cove,</i>

21:13.272 --> 21:17.526
but you may also remember her as the woman
who was bitchy to Linda Evans

21:17.609 --> 21:19.695
-in a jewelry store on <i>Dynasty.</i>
-[chuckles softly]

21:20.654 --> 21:22.406
In an attempt to restart her career,

21:22.489 --> 21:27.035
she played a wrestler
on the short-lived TV show <i>GLOW,</i>

21:27.577 --> 21:30.706
which ultimately flamed out
on the Vegas stage.

21:31.206 --> 21:35.043
A fledgling producer
who never had a project of her own.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.422
She is survived by...

21:39.089 --> 21:40.048
um...

21:41.466 --> 21:42.634
her mother,

21:43.885 --> 21:45.012
uh...

21:45.095 --> 21:48.307
her son, Randy, her ex-husband, Mark,
um...

21:48.557 --> 21:50.767
his secretary, Susan,

21:51.727 --> 21:54.646
and many adoring valets."

21:57.107 --> 21:59.735
If we died right now,
my obituary would be:

21:59.860 --> 22:03.071
"Soap Star and Unidentified Woman
Dead

22:03.155 --> 22:04.740
-in National Park."
-[chuckles]

22:05.032 --> 22:08.744
No. Well, at least Russell
would throw you a great funeral.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.329
He'd cut together a...

22:10.954 --> 22:15.125
-well-edited, adorable tribute montage--
-Sam told me he's in love with me.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.132
Okay, you're gonna have to tell me
how you feel about that,

22:22.215 --> 22:24.301
'cause I can't see your face in the dark.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.054
I don't know.

22:28.096 --> 22:28.930
Okay.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.516
Here are some choices.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.185
A: Happy.<i> </i>

22:33.268 --> 22:35.062
B: Scared.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.897
C: Excited.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.983
D: Repulsed.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.987
B. And...

22:45.155 --> 22:46.239
C.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.702
Okay, well,
what are you gonna do about it?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.079
I don't know. [chuckles]

22:52.996 --> 22:54.790
I thought I wanted a job.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.124
And a boyfriend.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.504
Now I have a job till the end of the year
and a boyfriend,

23:00.587 --> 23:03.423
and somehow I still feel lost.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.219
Well, maybe you feel lost
because you're holding yourself back

23:07.302 --> 23:09.054
from something that you want.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.809
[laughs] So, what,
I'm supposed to go back to the hotel,

23:13.934 --> 23:16.019
tell Sam I love him, and then what? We...

23:16.645 --> 23:18.230
ride off into the sunset?

23:18.313 --> 23:20.607
Jesus. You love him?

23:21.566 --> 23:22.567
-What?
-I...

23:22.651 --> 23:23.527
[laughs]

23:24.277 --> 23:26.738
Then, yeah, that's what you should do.
[chuckles]

23:28.573 --> 23:32.202
I mean, what the hell do I know?
I don't even know how to be a producer,

23:32.285 --> 23:35.705
which is technically my job title
that I fought for

23:35.789 --> 23:39.501
that Bash has basically
just rendered meaningless. So...

23:40.127 --> 23:42.879
At least if I go home to Randy,
he'll... he'll need me.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.090
[sighs]

23:45.966 --> 23:46.925
You know, I...

23:47.759 --> 23:51.638
I think I avoid talking about Randy.
Uh...

23:52.764 --> 23:56.059
It's this whole part of your life
I never wanna touch, because...

23:56.226 --> 23:57.102
And...

23:57.602 --> 23:59.563
that's fine, but...

24:00.772 --> 24:02.441
why don't you bring him to Vegas?

24:03.483 --> 24:06.194
You wanna work,
you wanna be with your kid. I...

24:06.278 --> 24:09.072
I don't know how to solve
any of the other problems, but...

24:09.406 --> 24:10.657
that's a start.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.786
Right, 'cause...
it's such a great place for children.

24:14.870 --> 24:15.787
[both chuckle]

24:16.163 --> 24:17.956
He would probably like
the flashing lights.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.208
-[laughs]
-And the noise.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.169
-[exhales]
-There's a pool.

24:22.836 --> 24:26.506
-And Jell-O at the buffet.
-[both laugh]

24:26.590 --> 24:27.549
[twigs snapping]

24:28.425 --> 24:31.595
-Oh, my God! Is that a mountain lion?
-Are there mountain lions in the desert?

24:31.678 --> 24:35.140
[panting] Guys, Sheila's really loopy
and dehydrated.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.099
[mutters]

24:36.183 --> 24:38.685
-We gotta get her back to camp.
-Do you know how to get back?

24:38.768 --> 24:40.645
Um, yeah, I've been following
the rock clusters.

24:41.563 --> 24:45.817
-Come on.
-[Ruth sighs, giggles excitedly]

24:45.942 --> 24:49.154
And the wise child's always asking
questions about the laws of Passover,

24:49.237 --> 24:50.405
like, "What are they?"

24:50.739 --> 24:52.240
Doesn't sound that wise to me.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.409
-[group laughs]
-No, thank you. Exactly.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.662
Which is why I myself always identify more
with the wicked child.

24:57.787 --> 24:58.747
-[Tammé] Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.166
Who's always setting themself apart
from the group

25:01.249 --> 25:04.586
by asking questions like,
"Why do we even do this holiday?"

25:04.669 --> 25:06.713
-[group laughs]
-[Melrose] My family thought it was funny

25:06.796 --> 25:09.257
to make me the wicked child
every single year.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.010
-"Melanie's such a bad Jew. She's wicked.
-[group laughs]

25:12.093 --> 25:13.803
Now, her sister, incredible Jew,

25:13.887 --> 25:17.140
wears a Jew-of-the-Year sash.
Her husband works in finance--"

25:17.224 --> 25:19.226
-Where you goin'?
-[Jenny] I'm tired.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.479
-I'm going to bed.
-[Melrose] It's almost over.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.315
You're just talking about yourself

25:25.398 --> 25:27.317
and pretending like it relates
to everybody else.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.612
No, I'm not. It's a parable.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.405
Oh, yeah?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.158
-About what?
-[Melrose] About...

25:35.909 --> 25:36.826
freedom.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.789
[Arthie] It's about
the immigrant experience, right?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.917
How the first generation
wanders the desert,

25:44.376 --> 25:47.254
and then the promised land
is for their children.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.422
Arthie, are you secretly a Jew?

25:49.506 --> 25:50.840
You holding out on me?

25:50.924 --> 25:54.344
-[group chuckles]
-I'll stop talking about myself.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.304
You're right.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.682
Passover is not about me.

26:02.686 --> 26:06.523
No, it's about a bunch of Jewish slaves
from, like, a bajillion years ago.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.277
Well, I mean, trauma
and mass oppression are still a...

26:10.360 --> 26:12.362
pretty recent story for my people.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.115
Ever hear of a little thing
called the Holocaust?

26:16.116 --> 26:16.950
[Cherry] Okay.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.911
Let's just... Let's just call it a night.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.496
[Melrose] What?
You'd rather I just joke around?

26:22.914 --> 26:23.915
Just jokes, huh?

26:24.291 --> 26:26.876
Not really get into the trauma

26:26.960 --> 26:29.254
that's behind all the shit
we don't want to talk about?

26:30.755 --> 26:31.798
[choked up] How...

26:32.549 --> 26:36.761
my Aunt Pestel and her eight children

26:36.845 --> 26:38.179
died in Treblinka?

26:38.805 --> 26:41.182
Or how my dad,

26:42.058 --> 26:43.143
my dad,

26:43.852 --> 26:47.397
won't live in a house without a basement
or an attic in case we have to hide again?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.613
[Jenny] We hid on a boat.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.452
We were pretty lucky.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.912
My dad, he, uh...

27:03.830 --> 27:05.665
he knew somebody at the embassy.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.334
So...

27:09.753 --> 27:14.591
we got one of the last flights out
on a US military plane that had just...

27:15.216 --> 27:16.885
dropped off all this rice.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.221
My dad's brother was with us.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.601
But... [sighs]

27:31.608 --> 27:33.443
everyone else we knew died.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.326
Every relative.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.372
Every friend.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.376
Everyone.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.756
So...

27:57.676 --> 28:00.303
I understand what it's like
to survive a genocide

28:00.387 --> 28:02.681
and not talk about it all the time.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.440
The killing fields.

28:18.029 --> 28:22.784
I mean, it's the whole reason
I'm even here in the first place. [laughs]

28:23.243 --> 28:24.244
[sniffles]

28:25.537 --> 28:26.996
I get to be...

28:28.331 --> 28:30.750
one of the lucky ones. Like, really...

28:32.544 --> 28:34.170
really, really lucky.

28:35.797 --> 28:36.798
[sniffles]

28:38.675 --> 28:40.385
And now I'm jumping out

28:40.677 --> 28:43.221
of a fortune cookie every night,

28:43.304 --> 28:45.348
pretending like everything's fine.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.311
[crying] I am so sorry.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.899
I had no idea.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.953
I'm so, so, so, so, so sorry.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.663
[Jenny sobs]

29:08.747 --> 29:11.499
[soothing instrumental music playing]

29:25.722 --> 29:28.391
[Debbie] Uh, guys? What're you guys doing?

29:31.811 --> 29:33.563
Oh, my God. Is that Elijah?

29:34.856 --> 29:36.399
Who the fuck is Elijah?

29:39.569 --> 29:43.907
[sighs]
I'mma go stretch out in the stretch.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.618
-Good night.
-Good night.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.832
Her poor back.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.126
-I know.
-[car door opens]

29:55.960 --> 29:57.378
[Rhonda sighs]

29:57.587 --> 29:58.505
[car door closes]

29:59.464 --> 30:00.757
When I slept in my car,

30:01.758 --> 30:03.843
I'd always try and park somewhere pretty,

30:04.135 --> 30:06.554
so when I woke up,
I'd feel better about my life.

30:06.888 --> 30:07.972
[chuckles]

30:14.521 --> 30:16.523
Your life is pretty good now, right?

30:17.190 --> 30:18.107
[tuts]

30:18.191 --> 30:20.902
If you're gonna start too,
you can just get out of the Porsche.

30:20.985 --> 30:24.489
I'm not being sarcastic. I'm asking you.
You're happy?

30:25.323 --> 30:26.491
With Bash?

30:30.578 --> 30:31.704
[clicks tongue] I am.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.125
[sighs]
But I know it's awkward for you, though.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.961
Why is it awkward?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.965
You know,
in case you still have feelings for him.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.593
-[scoffs] For Bash?
-Yeah. I thought you had a crush on him.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.179
Maybe back when I first met him, but...

30:48.555 --> 30:49.973
I don't want Bash.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.726
Oh. [exhales]

30:54.435 --> 30:55.311
I mean,

30:56.020 --> 30:57.438
I'd like a boyfriend.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.862
I've never heard you talk
about boys before.

31:04.529 --> 31:05.822
I mean, besides your brothers.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.995
Ever since you left, it's, like...

31:12.412 --> 31:14.080
people keep crashing in my room.

31:14.163 --> 31:16.207
Like, when their roommates are having sex.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.378
They never think,
"Maybe Carmen's in there with a guy."

31:21.921 --> 31:24.632
They just assume I'm alone, sexless.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.058
Have you ever played Mash?

31:34.809 --> 31:35.894
Like the TV show?

31:36.603 --> 31:38.104
-No.
-[glove compartment latch clicks]

31:38.187 --> 31:39.898
-[objects rattle]
-Okay...

31:42.358 --> 31:43.401
Hmm.

31:43.943 --> 31:47.322
Mansion. Apartment. Shack. House.
Name four guys.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.198
Okay. Um...

31:49.282 --> 31:51.200
No, don't think. Just say four names.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.828
Okay, um, Don Johnson.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.914
Manny from the kitchen. Keith. What?

31:56.623 --> 31:57.749
[Rhonda gasps quietly]

31:57.916 --> 31:59.500
-Keith?
-[Rhonda laughs]

32:00.209 --> 32:02.629
-I'm saying it. Keith...
-[Rhonda laughing]

32:02.712 --> 32:05.006
Macho Man Randy Savage.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.342
They were just stoned.

32:08.051 --> 32:11.804
Look, when people show you who they are,
you have to pay attention.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.018
Dawn and Stacey always say
stupid, offensive things.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.062
Yeah, because they're fucking homophobic.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.773
Don't make excuses.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.484
Your friends disappointing you?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.195
This is the type of shit
you have to deal with when you're gay.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.948
[sighs]

32:33.159 --> 32:34.786
And what if you don't know?

32:36.537 --> 32:37.413
If you're...

32:39.123 --> 32:40.041
you know.

32:44.003 --> 32:44.921
What do you mean?

32:48.257 --> 32:49.467
[inhales deeply]

32:54.180 --> 32:56.349
I know I'm in love with you.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.060
And I want to be with you.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.063
But...

33:04.983 --> 33:07.610
I'm not sure if I'm...

33:10.196 --> 33:11.155
that word.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.619
So... So, what are you then?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.999
Why do I have to be anything?

33:25.420 --> 33:28.381
I can't fuck with a straight girl
who doesn't know who she is

33:28.464 --> 33:29.799
or what she wants.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.053
I didn't say that.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.014
You did.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.544
[Sheila sighs]

34:08.004 --> 34:10.173
Hey. How you feeling?

34:12.717 --> 34:13.760
I'm better.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.058
Justine wrote a screenplay.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.184
And...

34:22.560 --> 34:23.519
it's really good.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.731
Like, <i>really </i>good.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.816
Funny and real.

34:29.108 --> 34:32.904
[clicks tongue, sighs]
Oh, and I feel so bad for Sam.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.367
I mean, who knows?

34:39.827 --> 34:41.662
His could be this good too, right?

34:49.587 --> 34:51.089
Do you wanna... sit?

34:51.172 --> 34:53.424
I've got half a bag of marshmallows left.

35:01.474 --> 35:04.393
Oh! Oh, my God! Sheila!

35:06.979 --> 35:08.689
Are you out of your mind?

35:09.690 --> 35:12.401
[inhales deeply] Never been more clear.

35:15.029 --> 35:18.032
[yells] Never been more clear!

35:18.533 --> 35:20.159
[Dawn, yelling] Shut up!

35:20.785 --> 35:23.287
[Stacey, yelling]
Yeah, we're trying to sleep over here!

35:25.373 --> 35:26.916
[laughs]

35:27.708 --> 35:28.668
[sniffles]

35:29.961 --> 35:31.129
[sighs]

35:37.468 --> 35:38.845
Why did you do that?

35:42.515 --> 35:44.016
It was getting in my way.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.894
[soothing instrumental music playing]

35:46.978 --> 35:49.230
There are so many things
that I want to do.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.858
And become.

35:56.779 --> 35:58.239
[crying softly]

36:05.830 --> 36:08.666
-[sniffles]
-Wow.

36:14.046 --> 36:14.922
I like it.

36:16.799 --> 36:17.925
[quietly] Thank you.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.432
[birds singing]

36:43.743 --> 36:45.036
[exhales]

36:47.872 --> 36:48.915
[sighs contentedly]

36:50.958 --> 36:51.834
Oh...

36:52.376 --> 36:55.046
I slept so good in that limo.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.423
[takes a deep breath] Listen, um...

36:57.757 --> 37:00.426
so, Cherry's right.
It's stupid to put you back in that ring.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.721
But what if Welfare Queen
isn't a wrestler?

37:04.096 --> 37:05.348
She's a manager?

37:05.640 --> 37:07.767
And... it'll lighten things up.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.019
And Bash will have something
to play off of in the ring.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.272
I mean, you should probably
have Rhonda tell him.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.107
It'd be better coming from her.

37:16.234 --> 37:20.238
And, um,
I am not going to be around, anyway.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.573
Why? Where you think you're going?

37:22.740 --> 37:25.952
[sighs] You know I can't do
nine months like this with a small kid.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.079
Bring him here.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.999
-That's what Ruth said.
-[Tammé] Well, she's right.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.378
If I had it to do all over again,
I wouldn't have waited so long.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.214
Even with Ernest. I should've dragged him
to a few auditions.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.549
Especially when he was a baby
and didn't know any better.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.551
So, what are you saying?

37:44.387 --> 37:46.973
Don't fold your tent
and give up on a show

37:47.056 --> 37:49.475
that you produce and star in.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.894
Stay and fight.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.188
