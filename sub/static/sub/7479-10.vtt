00:01.266 --> 00:03.598
Previously on NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:03.737 --> 00:05.898
I thought I'd surprise my husband.

00:06.106 --> 00:09.598
He's been living in this country
under the name Branston Cole.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.506
You shot him, put him into an assisted
living facility as your husband

00:13.681 --> 00:16.241
under a new name so you could keep
working him for information.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.510
That is quite a theory, Mr. Callen.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.584
Cole allegedly had a little black book

00:20.754 --> 00:24.349
on some of his secret operations
of the KGB, the U.S. And Israel.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.753
Every spook will be looking
for that intel

00:26.927 --> 00:28.724
and we need to find it first.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.191
I don't want the book.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.421
I want Cole.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.224
I'm sorry, Herta.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.194
My plan is to prevent an
onslaught of foreign operatives

00:38.405 --> 00:41.636
from tearing this town apart looking
for that book.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.919
Hi.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.420
Hi.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.314
Need your license, registration
and proof of insurance.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.512
Sure, what's up?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.748
Reports of someone
dealing marijuana to minors.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.755
Said they drove a red convertible.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.518
Not us, officer.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.595
Your plates don't match
your vehicle's VIN.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.664
Have to impound
unless you agree to a search.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.163
You're kidding.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.459
Wanna open the trunk?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.996
Sure, no problem.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.311
Open it.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.689
I like guns.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.126
Everybody gets excited
about the big guns.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.596
Me, I like the.22.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.668
Goes in the skull,
bounces around.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.896
Turns the brain into soup.

02:19.106 --> 02:22.701
No, no, no. Ah!

02:50.371 --> 02:52.771
Oh, he gets one, all right.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.030
Next basket wins.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.335
- Gotta win by two points.
- Sudden death, did that.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.876
Next basket, Champion of the World.
That's it.

03:01.782 --> 03:05.377
Whoa, whoa. That doesn't count.
That doesn't count.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.020
You're dead.
Champion of the World.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.849
Hetty said
you can't bring rescues here.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.355
It's not a rescue.
It's a police dog and we're training.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.960
- Thanks, Susie.
- Dog cost me Champion of the World.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.095
Looks like your dog's got mange.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.459
Monty and I do undercover work
together, don't we?

03:19.666 --> 03:21.691
He has a way of making the bad guys
feel at ease.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.803
- He kind of looks like you.
- You look like me?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.700
You do because I'm your daddy,
aren't I?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.737
Well, they are clearly in love.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.238
Clearly, love is blind.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.774
You know what?

03:30.944 --> 03:33.037
- One day, this dog will save your life.
- Right.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.238
Come here, cover his eyes.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.249
And you attack, attack.
Just kidding, don't attack her.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.616
Gentlemen, feast your eyes on this.
Do you know what this is?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.814
Plastic explosives. It goes in there.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.618
Keep them closed, Monty.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.425
Hidden inside the bag.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.998
Now, all right, you can let go.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.465
Monty, find the bomb.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.905
Find the bomb, Monty.
Find the explosive, Monty.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.271
Monty, go find the explosive.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.310
Go that way.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.142
How old is this dog?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.409
He can't do this
if he's sensing your hostility.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.418
Aren't police dogs supposed
to work in hostile environments?

04:14.621 --> 04:16.521
I don't get it.
This works at the dog park.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.748
Yeah, terrorists bomb a lot
of dog parks.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.019
- You are intimidating him.
- Oh, yeah, he looks terrified.

04:24.531 --> 04:28.797
Sam, one day
that dog is gonna save your life.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.931
Guys, weird call from Hetty.
Something about a shooting.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.167
What's your deal? It's just us now.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.605
Is this how it's gonna be?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.379
Now, you look. That's perfect.

04:43.851 --> 04:48.117
Just embarrass me in front
of my friends and my colleagues.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.018
Really, you're just gonna...

04:51.191 --> 04:53.853
Oh, I should have sold you
to that animal testing lab.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.210
Who are you?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.519
Who are you?

05:26.793 --> 05:29.057
Thank you, Rosemary.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.088
I'm Sylvia.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.893
I'm your wife. Have you forgotten?

05:35.402 --> 05:38.667
You remind me of someone else.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.871
Did you pee?

05:41.074 --> 05:43.770
What sort of question is that?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.707
The sort of question

05:45.879 --> 05:49.872
a wife asks her husband
when he's having trouble peeing.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.615
Why are you here?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.179
To read to you.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.585
I always read to you.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.850
It's still raining.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.893
Yes, Branston.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.298
Looks as if it could rain forever.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.937
Hetty?

06:20.447 --> 06:21.709
I knew that nurse.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.609
Rosemary Edmonds.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.275
She was very kind.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.978
She bought me
a Christmas present once.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.585
You played Cole's wife that often?

06:34.428 --> 06:39.388
When one's life
is based on deception,

06:39.566 --> 06:44.265
my marriage to Branston
might be as close

06:44.438 --> 06:47.805
as I've ever gotten to the real thing.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.251
Looks like two different calibers,
two shooters.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.649
Soft targets surrounded by civilians.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.416
They didn't need to kill the nurse
or the guard in the hallway.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.525
No, but they did.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.995
Without compunction
and without compassion.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.196
They've changed the rules.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.531
Branston would be appalled.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.638
Well, this is where it all ends.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.936
It's not that bad.
You can learn from older people.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.943
They have wisdom, kindness.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.682
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, did he just...?

07:31.852 --> 07:32.876
Retirement communities

07:33.053 --> 07:35.214
have the highest rate
of sexually transmitted diseases

07:35.422 --> 07:37.014
in comparison
to any demographic group.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.350
- Please stop talking.
- Why?

07:38.525 --> 07:40.220
It gives you something
to look forward to.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.395
Why do you think they call it
the "rocking chair"?

07:42.562 --> 07:43.995
Enough.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.325
All the security cameras
feed into here.

07:47.734 --> 07:51.363
Hard drives have all been removed.
No home movies for us.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.004
Branston Cole was
an East German spy

07:58.178 --> 08:01.238
who took asylum in the West.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.676
He was a traitor.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.651
Well, sure, 25 years ago.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.410
It's a long time to hold a grudge.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.145
Not just revenge.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.450
These drawers have been searched.
They were looking for something.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.720
The little black bloody book.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.730
First Renner and now Cole.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.731
They won't stop until they get it.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.736
"They" being?

08:23.904 --> 08:27.738
Any of a myriad
of foreign security agencies

08:27.908 --> 08:31.742
that believe the bloody book
still has value.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.745
Hetty, if anyone knows
about your relationship with Cole,

08:34.914 --> 08:37.042
they're gonna assume you know
where the book is.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.616
Means we will have to protect you.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.020
I can protect myself.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.424
I'd like to find the men
who did this

08:46.593 --> 08:49.426
and put their heads on spears.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.928
Is that what you used to do
in the old days?

08:52.132 --> 08:55.397
They changed the rules, not me.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.203
Surveillance is ripped out.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.965
But Mr. Smugger in Room 27

09:02.142 --> 09:04.235
was kind enough to lend us
his security camera.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.504
It was pointed into the hallway.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.542
There.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.380
- He turns his head.
- Need to enhance that, Eric.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.785
I'll run an image trace,
see if we can bring out the details.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.731
It's not your fault, Hetty.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.776
I thought
that with Mattias in custody,

09:39.980 --> 09:43.177
it was done, finished.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.750
I was wrong.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.286
And if I'm at fault, that's why.

09:49.456 --> 09:54.291
And from that,
everything that followed, Mr. Callen...

09:56.196 --> 09:58.187
We can't protect everyone.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.333
I said that to you.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.598
My first day on the job, I remember.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.610
It would do you some good
to remember as well.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.009
So this little black book?

10:15.215 --> 10:19.208
Three decades
of Cold War treachery.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.819
Names of spies.

10:20.987 --> 10:26.186
Identities of sleeper agents and traitors
from a dozen different countries.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.987
The power
to bring down governments.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.658
Yes, Mr. Callen, still.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.390
So everyone believes.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.302
Leave the book to me

10:39.472 --> 10:42.373
and I'll leave you
to sharpen the spears.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.009
- Hetty?
- Miss Jones, my office.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.203
I'm on my way.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.853
- Any luck?
- Not for facial recognition.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.924
I know those guys.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.855
You can't identify them from that.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.520
L.A.P.D. Just put out an all-points.
A cop was killed this morning.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.770
Dash cam video from the patrol car.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.367
Same guys, right?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.544
Ten out of ten facial points
match up.

11:21.748 --> 11:25.650
- Can we hear what they're saying?
- It's too far away for audio.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.084
Can you read them?

11:29.756 --> 11:31.348
Play it back.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.593
Bistra, bis...? I don't know that word.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.058
Bistro like café?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.892
No.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.059
It's Russian.
It means, "We've got to move."

11:44.271 --> 11:47.900
- GRU.
- Russian military intelligence.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.405
They're here for Cole's book.

11:49.609 --> 11:53.443
Eric, run through facial recognition,
compare them to known GRU agents.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.875
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.243
I'll give Hetty the good news.

12:20.305 --> 12:21.363
Cool table.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.770
It's Victorian, mid to late 18th century.

12:23.942 --> 12:25.842
And I'm guessing not a repro.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.878
Sebastian Renner's boyfriend
had taste.

12:29.047 --> 12:30.776
Mm, and deep pockets.

12:30.983 --> 12:36.944
Renner used his friend's business
here to hide his arms deals.

12:37.156 --> 12:40.557
There must be a lot of money
hidden somewhere.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.555
That's what we're after?

12:42.728 --> 12:45.822
I thought we were looking
for the hard copy of Cole's book.

12:46.031 --> 12:50.024
We're after whatever we can find,
Miss Jones.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.568
Move to Renner's house

12:52.738 --> 12:56.469
and take it apart brick by brick
if you have to.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.734
I'll do my best.

12:58.977 --> 13:02.572
I believe you will, Miss Jones.

13:29.341 --> 13:30.501
Mattias.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.873
This is getting to be a habit.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.050
I told my director

13:39.218 --> 13:44.588
that he might someday regret
having passed you on to the CIA.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.621
And one day later?

13:47.192 --> 13:49.217
The regret is all mine.

13:51.296 --> 13:53.958
And now you're asking yourself

13:54.132 --> 13:59.365
why would the CIA free me,
especially after I tried to kill you?

13:59.538 --> 14:02.564
Obvious answer,
you're working for them.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.140
You get your freedom.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.435
What did they get?

14:07.646 --> 14:08.874
The book.

14:09.047 --> 14:11.277
Ah, you said you didn't think
it even existed.

14:11.516 --> 14:16.385
Doesn't matter what I think.
The CIA believes it exists.

14:16.588 --> 14:20.149
And by your presence here,
so do you.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.424
Although, I do find it odd.

14:23.595 --> 14:26.758
This office has already been
thoroughly searched.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.162
Then why are you here, Mattias?

14:29.401 --> 14:31.835
Because the easiest way
to find the book...

14:32.070 --> 14:33.731
Is to follow me.

14:35.607 --> 14:37.541
You're aware
there are other players?

14:37.743 --> 14:41.304
Isn't it in both our interests
that the Russians don't get the book?

14:42.180 --> 14:43.408
The Russians?

14:44.916 --> 14:49.444
Then I can trust you
to leave my agent inside alone.

14:49.655 --> 14:53.421
She'll find nothing and you know it.
It's a shell game.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.153
You want us looking here
so we're not looking somewhere else.

14:57.329 --> 15:00.196
I could shoot you right now, Mattias,

15:02.100 --> 15:05.592
but you're not even worth
the paperwork.

15:13.478 --> 15:15.105
We've identified the shooters.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.770
- They are...
- Russians.

15:16.948 --> 15:18.677
Tell me something I don't know,
Mr. Callen.

15:18.850 --> 15:21.546
No facial recognition.
They're not regular GRU agents.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.314
And we're thinking they could be
sleepers, been here for years.

15:24.489 --> 15:25.513
Has Nell checked in?

15:25.691 --> 15:28.489
She found nothing
so she moved on to Renner's house.

15:28.660 --> 15:32.619
I, on the other hand, think
I might have found the book.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.858
I couldn't find any evidence
that Sebastian Renner had a laptop.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.501
But that didn't really make sense.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.331
An arms dealer like Renner
must have had offshore accounts.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.200
He'd have to keep track
of that money.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.534
So I ran a check.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.404
He used Internet cafés,
a different computer every time,

15:46.611 --> 15:49.478
which means he needed to store
his information in cyber space.

15:49.648 --> 15:53.744
Now there's only one web connection
to Renner that I could find.

15:53.985 --> 15:56.886
He put his house up for sale
for a brief period two years ago.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.885
This is the listing for the house.

15:59.057 --> 16:01.321
Renner was hiding his information
in plain sight,

16:01.526 --> 16:04.495
in all the ones and zeros that make up
the code to the photographs.

16:04.696 --> 16:09.156
Now, when I extracted anomalies
hidden in this photo...

16:14.439 --> 16:16.839
Now, some are offshore accounts
but look at this.

16:18.076 --> 16:20.544
Cole's book was
his get-out-of-jail card.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.771
What's the number next to it?

16:22.948 --> 16:26.042
It's an account at the Certified
National Bank in downtown L.A.

16:26.251 --> 16:30.017
The account is attached
to a safe deposit box, number 999.

16:30.222 --> 16:31.951
We need the key to that box.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.454
That's why
I searched Renner's house.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.719
- Where did you get that?
- From a little birdie.

16:37.929 --> 16:41.865
Good job, Miss Jones, Mr. Beale.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.024
We need to get into that bank, Eric.

16:44.202 --> 16:47.069
I can set you up with an ID
as Renner's attorney

16:47.239 --> 16:49.298
who is authorized to access the box.

16:50.675 --> 16:53.269
Sharpening the spears
is gonna have to wait.

17:20.137 --> 17:22.299
Anybody see anything?

17:23.508 --> 17:26.170
Wait a second, I've got one of the guys
who killed the cop.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.778
He's at the bus stop
across the street.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.216
Three more guys in a Jaguar
are pulling up behind you, G.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.128
This is a stakeout.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.764
- A stakeout for what?
- Us.

17:46.932 --> 17:47.956
Cole must have told them

17:48.133 --> 17:50.624
about Renner's safe deposit box
before they killed him.

17:50.802 --> 17:52.360
Without the key, they're stuck.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.524
They're waiting for us to get the book,
then they're gonna try to take it.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.332
They gotta ID us first.

18:00.879 --> 18:04.610
- Yeah.
- Do not move, Agent Callen.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.844
Sam, I think they already have.

18:22.766 --> 18:25.860
Get the book, give it to us
or you die.

18:26.036 --> 18:28.402
Simple. Tell me you understand.

18:28.639 --> 18:30.834
I understand.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.043
The shooter's on top of the steps
to the right of the public library.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.838
- Okay, let's take him out.
- No.

18:38.048 --> 18:40.676
The laser was to get attention.
There could be a second shooter.

18:40.885 --> 18:43.854
Sam, we're gonna have to play
by their rules. I can't go into the bank.

18:44.021 --> 18:45.852
You're gonna have to do it.

18:46.023 --> 18:47.854
Eric, I need backstopping now.

18:48.058 --> 18:50.322
- I'm gonna need five minutes.
- You've got two.

19:00.170 --> 19:01.228
Yeah?

19:01.438 --> 19:04.601
You have an agent
at the Certified National Bank.

19:04.808 --> 19:08.369
One of our CIA friends
is about to join him.

19:08.546 --> 19:11.515
When your man gets the book,
please give it to him.

19:11.682 --> 19:15.550
You are aware that the Russians
are also at the bank.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.118
Yes.

19:17.321 --> 19:19.721
Give me the book,
then the Russians are my problem.

19:22.092 --> 19:26.586
Mr. Callen, one of our cousins
is about to join you.

19:26.764 --> 19:30.325
Do whatever he tells you to do.

19:30.534 --> 19:31.899
Do you understand me?

19:33.404 --> 19:34.462
I understand.

19:34.705 --> 19:36.036
Mr. Hanna?

19:36.206 --> 19:37.935
Yeah, I got it, Hetty.

19:57.061 --> 19:59.086
Welcome to the party.

19:59.630 --> 20:01.495
You realize we have company.

20:01.665 --> 20:04.395
- Are you wearing a vest?
- No.

20:04.568 --> 20:06.798
You should always wear a vest.

20:08.238 --> 20:10.297
Send in one of your people
to get the book.

20:10.474 --> 20:13.500
I'm not starting a firefight
in the middle of downtown L.A.

20:13.677 --> 20:16.305
Let me try something
a little more elegant.

20:16.947 --> 20:18.005
What did you have in mind?

20:18.248 --> 20:20.443
Give the Russians
something to chase.

20:20.951 --> 20:22.179
Kensi, cross over to my car.

20:28.626 --> 20:29.684
Eric, how are we doing?

20:29.927 --> 20:30.985
Gonna need more time.

20:34.431 --> 20:36.922
Go into the bank,
ask to see the safe deposit boxes.

20:37.134 --> 20:40.968
Tell them you're opening an account.
Check out the boxes, exit the bank.

20:41.138 --> 20:42.799
Act nervous,
pretend you have the book.

20:43.007 --> 20:45.271
- Bait and switch.
- The Russians will follow you.

20:45.442 --> 20:47.103
- Deeks?
- I'll have her back.

20:47.277 --> 20:50.007
- When you exit the bank...
- Escape and evade?

20:50.180 --> 20:51.442
Easy as pie.

20:51.615 --> 20:53.310
One more thing.

20:53.517 --> 20:55.144
Got any gum?

21:09.633 --> 21:12.693
Well, I guess Mattias doesn't trust us
after all, Sam.

21:14.872 --> 21:16.134
Eric, the clock is running.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.240
You realize this is a bank
I'm breaking into.

21:29.887 --> 21:31.650
How's the arm?

21:59.616 --> 22:01.345
Yeah.

22:05.055 --> 22:07.387
I suppose you're wearing
a vest then.

22:07.558 --> 22:10.288
Yeah. And no, you can't borrow it.

22:10.494 --> 22:11.586
I totally understand.

22:12.296 --> 22:13.786
Forget I even mentioned it.

22:28.312 --> 22:30.143
She's coming out.

22:30.314 --> 22:32.874
Hi. I need to access
a safety deposit box.

22:33.050 --> 22:36.019
- Of course, name?
- Sebastian Renner.

22:36.220 --> 22:38.450
Unfortunately, Mr. Renner
is deceased.

22:38.622 --> 22:39.953
I have power of attorney.

22:48.832 --> 22:51.027
Go, go.

23:00.544 --> 23:01.841
Sorry about that.

23:02.045 --> 23:04.536
- That hurt?
- You bastard.

23:04.748 --> 23:07.911
Sebastian Renner.

23:08.118 --> 23:09.176
You have Mr. Renner's key?

23:09.419 --> 23:12.684
- Yeah.
- And your name?

23:12.923 --> 23:14.754
In case anyone's interested,
I'm not ready.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.586
- My name?
- It needs to be on record.

23:19.763 --> 23:21.754
- My name is...
- Maurice T. Grayson.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.091
Maurice T. Grayson.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.790
- T for?
- Thomas.

23:25.669 --> 23:27.933
- Tony, T is for Tony.
- But I prefer Tony.

23:31.074 --> 23:33.008
- Can you authorize this?
- Oh.

23:38.649 --> 23:41.117
Running out of time, Eric.

23:42.486 --> 23:43.817
All right.

23:45.656 --> 23:48.352
Okay, that's all in order.

23:48.525 --> 23:50.720
If you'd like to follow me,
Mr. Grayson.

23:50.961 --> 23:53.589
Please, call me Tony.

23:54.131 --> 23:56.998
- Can you see the shooter?
- I'm guessing he left with his buddies.

23:57.201 --> 24:00.034
You wanna stick your head up there
and take a little peek?

24:00.671 --> 24:03.037
Sam, the Russians are gonna
figure out they've been had.

24:03.207 --> 24:05.175
They're gonna be back.
We got to make a move.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.002
I got it.

24:07.978 --> 24:09.878
Thought I dropped it.

24:19.056 --> 24:21.718
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:24.361 --> 24:26.386
Can I help you?

24:28.932 --> 24:30.661
He's with me.

24:47.351 --> 24:48.545
The box is empty, Hetty.

24:49.553 --> 24:50.747
And Mattias?

24:51.355 --> 24:52.413
Gone.

25:15.946 --> 25:18.414
Oh, that looks painful.
You wanna get some ice cream?

25:19.082 --> 25:20.913
Deeks, look out.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.382
Give us the book.

25:24.121 --> 25:25.486
We don't have it.

25:25.689 --> 25:27.384
Purse.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.595
Told you.

25:34.765 --> 25:37.131
- Get in the car.
- Mm-mm. She's not going anywhere.

25:37.334 --> 25:39.825
Then four of us die
and one of us lives.

25:41.505 --> 25:43.302
He's got a point.

25:43.473 --> 25:45.498
All right, take me.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.572
Deeks.

25:47.744 --> 25:49.735
She's just a cop.
She's not even an agent.

25:49.947 --> 25:52.347
Tell you the truth, no one
really even likes her that much.

25:52.516 --> 25:54.313
Too pretty for her own good,
kind of a snob.

25:54.484 --> 25:57.476
- Get in the car.
- Kensi, don't move.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.160
- Nice try, Deeks.
- Kensi?

26:09.266 --> 26:10.961
It's okay.

26:11.835 --> 26:12.927
You'll get me back.

26:15.505 --> 26:18.133
Tell your superior her life
for the book.

26:18.342 --> 26:21.277
Oh, yeah? How do you know
I'm not the superior? I could be.

26:21.478 --> 26:23.343
Kensi?

26:24.548 --> 26:26.277
Damn it.

26:27.317 --> 26:28.841
Eric, I got a license plate for you.

26:29.019 --> 26:32.682
It's nine, queen, John, Ida,
nine, zero, five.

26:38.295 --> 26:39.387
They got Kensi.

26:54.075 --> 26:56.839
Anonymous caller phoned in a website
to the Navy Yard in D.C.

26:57.011 --> 26:58.603
They just forwarded Eric the link.

27:12.627 --> 27:14.094
Tell us you can trace that, Eric.

27:14.862 --> 27:20.095
Milan,
Oslo, Barcelona, Frankfurt.

27:20.268 --> 27:23.237
- These are all proxies.
- That's not the question, Eric.

27:23.404 --> 27:25.133
Yeah, and not the answer.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.601
This is my fault.

27:31.779 --> 27:33.576
No.

27:33.748 --> 27:36.581
My plan, my fault.

27:41.823 --> 27:45.782
The Cold War was built
on the illusion of power.

27:46.027 --> 27:50.259
Silos with no missiles in them.
Missiles with no warheads.

27:50.431 --> 27:52.626
Little black books

27:52.800 --> 27:57.169
that weren't really little black books
at all.

27:57.338 --> 27:58.669
They'll never believe you.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.274
They would have believed me
in Cole's day.

28:01.442 --> 28:02.909
Well, this isn't Cole's day, Hetty.

28:03.077 --> 28:05.910
And you don't think it's mine either,
do you, Mr. Callen?

28:19.260 --> 28:22.627
Do you know where these barbarians
have taken my agent?

28:22.830 --> 28:25.697
I'm sorry, Herta, I don't know.

28:26.601 --> 28:30.367
You've never been sorry for anything,
Mattias. Don't start pretending now.

28:30.605 --> 28:32.129
I need the book.

28:32.307 --> 28:35.936
You'll have to get it off the Russians
after I've exchanged it for my agent.

28:37.111 --> 28:39.272
The agency is calling your director.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.313
- He'll tell them to go to hell.
- For a time.

28:42.517 --> 28:44.678
But then, under protest,
he will agree.

28:44.886 --> 28:48.481
- You don't know my director.
- But I do know you, Herta.

28:48.690 --> 28:50.385
A hundred agents could die

28:50.591 --> 28:53.025
and you still would not hand that book
over to the Russians.

28:53.227 --> 28:57.459
I need time to retrieve my agent.

28:57.665 --> 28:58.723
You have one hour.

29:03.871 --> 29:08.035
Mr. Deeks, we're going to give
the Russians what they want.

29:08.242 --> 29:10.642
And we're going to get back
Miss Blye.

29:11.546 --> 29:13.480
I thought we didn't have the book.

29:13.648 --> 29:14.876
That is a problem.

29:30.164 --> 29:31.631
Why isn't she moving?

29:31.833 --> 29:34.358
She should be trying to find
a way to escape.

29:34.569 --> 29:37.561
- She's just standing there.
- She knows she's being watched.

29:38.539 --> 29:40.200
She's waiting.

29:41.943 --> 29:43.570
For us.

29:43.745 --> 29:47.237
Contact. The Russians just posted
a time and the place on the website.

29:47.448 --> 29:49.006
Exchange is in 30 minutes.

29:49.217 --> 29:50.241
Miss Jones.

29:51.018 --> 29:52.645
But I'm nowhere near done.

29:52.854 --> 29:56.449
Well, what you've done
will have to do.

29:56.691 --> 29:59.888
Well, I've added a single microdot
next to each page number.

30:00.094 --> 30:01.857
All taken from Renner's bookmark.

30:02.063 --> 30:04.361
But it's names and places mostly.

30:04.565 --> 30:06.294
Like I said, it's all declassified.

30:06.534 --> 30:08.900
You could find out more
by Googling the Cold War.

30:09.103 --> 30:10.764
- How many pages?
- Seven.

30:11.873 --> 30:14.205
But only the first three
will stand up to scrutiny.

30:14.409 --> 30:16.536
The others are deteriorated
because they're so old.

30:16.744 --> 30:18.211
Three it is.

30:23.050 --> 30:24.278
Bring her home, Mr. Callen.

30:24.485 --> 30:27.045
- But what about Mattias?
- I'll take care of Mattias.

30:27.221 --> 30:31.089
He's working for the CIA.
We're on the same side, remember?

30:42.503 --> 30:44.061
Showtime, Deeks.

30:44.705 --> 30:46.195
I hate opening nights.

30:51.078 --> 30:54.775
1984. Los Angeles Olympics.

30:54.949 --> 30:59.352
Jetpacks, pianos, marching bands.

30:59.587 --> 31:03.182
- But no Russians.
- No, no Russians.

31:03.357 --> 31:04.847
The last cold years of the Cold War

31:05.026 --> 31:07.790
deprived us of a famous victory
over America.

31:07.995 --> 31:10.759
Come on, we would have whipped
your ass and you know it.

31:12.166 --> 31:15.033
- The book?
- I don't see her.

31:15.837 --> 31:17.327
She's close.

31:21.676 --> 31:25.168
Microdots beside each page number.

31:31.118 --> 31:33.109
You know what,
why don't we forget track and field

31:33.287 --> 31:35.517
and just jump straight
to the closing ceremonies?

31:35.690 --> 31:37.487
Hey, Dolph Lundgren?

31:38.993 --> 31:40.358
No girl, no secrets.

32:11.692 --> 32:13.216
- Kensi?
- Deeks, stop.

32:14.295 --> 32:15.592
Switch off the lights.

32:23.004 --> 32:24.062
Okay.

32:25.339 --> 32:27.899
Now we know why you didn't move.

32:28.109 --> 32:30.509
It's not like a disco ball kind of thing,
is it?

32:30.678 --> 32:32.009
They're triggers.

32:32.179 --> 32:34.704
Break the beam,
the explosives detonate.

32:34.916 --> 32:38.044
Okay. Yeah, bomb squad.

32:38.219 --> 32:40.551
Deeks, I can't stand here
any longer, please?

32:40.721 --> 32:43.451
No, no, it's okay, it's okay, we'II, uh...

32:43.624 --> 32:47.583
- Plan B.
- Okay, what's plan B?

32:48.596 --> 32:49.688
I'm working on it.

33:30.871 --> 33:32.600
What, plan B is to put me out
of my misery?

33:32.773 --> 33:34.400
They're laser triggers.

33:34.675 --> 33:36.939
If the collector receives light
at the right frequency,

33:37.144 --> 33:39.135
it's not gonna register
the beam's been broken.

33:39.313 --> 33:42.282
Okay, you've seen this
being done before, right?

33:42.483 --> 33:44.417
Yeah... No, I mean, kind of...

33:44.585 --> 33:47.679
Yeah, well, in a book.
It was very helpful.

33:48.956 --> 33:50.287
We can call the bomb squad.

33:50.491 --> 33:52.584
- Just...
- Okay.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.923
This one.

33:56.297 --> 33:57.924
Ready?

34:04.438 --> 34:05.530
Hey.

34:26.527 --> 34:27.960
Kensi?

34:30.965 --> 34:32.556
Okay.

34:36.871 --> 34:38.565
Easy.

34:43.844 --> 34:45.004
Are you kidding me?

34:55.022 --> 34:56.580
That one.

34:58.492 --> 35:00.050
I can't get it.

35:00.561 --> 35:03.860
I think you're gonna have to do
this one yourself.

35:14.709 --> 35:15.733
Easy.

35:19.714 --> 35:21.409
Kensi?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.059
- Are you sure?
- No.

35:46.741 --> 35:48.902
On three, you ready?

35:51.378 --> 35:52.902
One.

35:53.781 --> 35:54.805
Two.

35:55.049 --> 35:56.141
- Three.
- Three.

36:01.255 --> 36:02.916
Deeks, status.

36:05.726 --> 36:07.887
Deeks, what's your status?

36:08.062 --> 36:10.121
We're good.

36:13.534 --> 36:15.263
You okay?

36:16.237 --> 36:17.397
I gotta pee.

36:17.938 --> 36:19.405
I think I just did.

36:25.780 --> 36:26.906
What's he saying?

36:31.685 --> 36:34.085
He's saying, "Help me."

36:34.255 --> 36:35.586
Sam, he's saying it in Russian.

36:41.695 --> 36:42.855
They're not CIA.

36:43.097 --> 36:45.463
Which means Mattias
has been playing Hetty all along.

37:04.383 --> 37:06.112
Herta?

37:14.026 --> 37:16.085
Herta?

37:45.958 --> 37:48.586
Because it could have been me.

37:50.429 --> 37:53.990
And I couldn't stand
to live without knowing

37:54.166 --> 37:57.226
that someone out there
gave a damn.

38:03.309 --> 38:06.472
Next time, just shoot straight.

38:14.453 --> 38:19.857
I used to feel remorse coming here.

38:21.127 --> 38:23.789
And today,

38:23.963 --> 38:26.761
I just feel relief.

38:29.602 --> 38:32.628
Hello, Mattias.

38:33.939 --> 38:36.772
We're getting old, Herta.

38:39.612 --> 38:40.943
Who will be next?

38:41.113 --> 38:46.813
Possibly you when the CIA finds out
you double-crossed them.

38:47.019 --> 38:48.646
The agency offered me freedom.

38:48.821 --> 38:50.948
The Russians offered me money.

38:51.123 --> 38:53.091
I took both.

38:54.093 --> 38:57.187
And now I've lost contact
with my Russian friends.

38:57.396 --> 38:59.159
What should I presume?

38:59.332 --> 39:00.594
The worst.

39:06.038 --> 39:09.496
Cole's book haunts us all.

39:09.675 --> 39:12.075
Everyone's secrets,

39:12.244 --> 39:16.146
the Russians, the Germans,
the CIA,

39:16.315 --> 39:18.215
yours,

39:19.485 --> 39:21.146
mine.

39:22.822 --> 39:24.414
It should have died with him.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.652
What makes you so sure it didn't?

39:33.833 --> 39:36.734
I need to know
that you'll never use it, Herta.

39:39.205 --> 39:42.072
Then for both our sakes,

39:42.241 --> 39:44.004
shoot straight.

40:02.728 --> 40:06.789
There is no book, is there, Herta?

40:09.268 --> 40:11.964
There never was.

40:30.055 --> 40:32.717
Tough night to be working
at Langley.

40:32.892 --> 40:34.917
Ugh, it's embarrassing.

40:35.094 --> 40:38.723
Russians running around pretending
to be working for the agency.

40:38.898 --> 40:40.559
What's the world coming to?

40:41.133 --> 40:42.430
Yeah, you've seen worse.

40:44.403 --> 40:46.303
Mattias is still out there.

40:46.505 --> 40:48.336
So he is.

40:48.574 --> 40:49.768
He was playing you all along.

40:49.975 --> 40:53.240
I was a fool to fall for it.

41:02.755 --> 41:04.780
You know, I've never
actually read this book.

41:04.990 --> 41:08.824
A gift from an old friend.

41:13.599 --> 41:15.794
Good night, Mr. Callen.

41:19.238 --> 41:22.139
Should we be worried
about Mattias?

41:22.308 --> 41:23.536
No.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.870
You shouldn't, Mr. Callen.

41:46.165 --> 41:47.530
You've been looking for a book.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.495
We thought you might like this one.

41:53.839 --> 41:57.172
Beautiful wife and home,

41:57.343 --> 41:59.334
a very nice vacation home.

41:59.545 --> 42:01.877
Oh, does your wife know about her?

42:02.715 --> 42:05.149
No? What about the secret
bank accounts?

42:07.920 --> 42:11.651
Everything you love.
Everything you own.

42:13.692 --> 42:16.820
If anything ever happens to Hetty,

42:16.996 --> 42:19.191
anything,

42:19.365 --> 42:20.798
we will come for you.

42:22.301 --> 42:27.432
I have no reason to harm her.

42:29.375 --> 42:32.435
The book does not exist.

42:33.879 --> 42:35.813
That's a good boy.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.524
It never did.
