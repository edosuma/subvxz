WEBVTT

01:17.619 --> 01:20.914
Come on, boy. Get up.
I'm not waiting around for you all day.

01:20.997 --> 01:21.998


01:26.670 --> 01:27.962
Good morning.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.683
Here.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.894
It's 6:00 a.m., Camila.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.021
Already?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.523
I haven't even slept yet.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.401
I can see that. What happened?

02:42.579 --> 02:43.997
Give me the short version.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.334
It's simple.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.502
Very simple.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.573
The blood belongs to Lúcia.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.744
How can I believe that?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.372
It's science, Marques. Believe it.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.458
If that's what the evidence says,
it's because it is Lúcia's blood.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.213
Camila, the girl was in an accident
in the middle of nowhere.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.465
She lost an arm.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.885
Her arm was out in the middle of nowhere.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.179
But we don't know where Lúcia's body is.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.723
What you're saying makes no sense.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.145
Okay. It's highly unlikely
that anyone could survive very long

03:49.229 --> 03:51.272
after having their arm ripped off.

03:51.856 --> 03:56.194
Unless that person received medical care
at the same location, right?

03:57.904 --> 03:58.988
Marques,

03:59.656 --> 04:03.910
the blood work toxicology report
showed traces of a very strong antibiotic

04:03.993 --> 04:06.162
that's very rare.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.123
Listen to me.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.252
We need to take Paula
away from that clinic.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.430
She's alive.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.891
I knew it.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.689
You were right, Paula.
The blood was Lúcia's.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.902
The lab report also showed traces
of a very strong antibiotic.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.698
She was probably injected with it
after losing her arm.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.951
I have to do something.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.621
Hold on. Come here.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.874
Thank you.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.599
I'm so fucking thirsty.
My mouth is so dry.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.435
- It's the medication.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.272
I'm not taking it, Camila.
I'm throwing it out.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.776
What if it's in the water?

05:19.194 --> 05:20.445
What do you mean?

05:20.528 --> 05:23.740
I saw the report on the medication
you're being given here.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.912
In the blood samples you sent us,
there are several unreported substances.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.415
If you're not taking any pills,
it's either in the food or water.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.294
- Fucking assholes.
- Calm down.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.589
We need to think clearly.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.927
One mistake, and we could lose
our chance to save Lúcia.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.847
We need help.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.232
You need to talk to Rafael.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.069
Rafael? What can Rafael do?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.780
Rafael? Nothing. But how about his father?

06:05.824 --> 06:06.950
No.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.288
He won't lift a finger to help me,
not even if I get on my knees and beg.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.835
Unfortunately,
I think he's the only person who can help.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.924
If Dr. Schultz finds out you're here,
I'll lose my job.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.176
I was just leaving.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.055
And you need to run those exams, Paula.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.493
I need you to relax.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.495
I need a cigarette.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.457
Did living longer stop being important?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.251
Dying doesn't matter.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.928
We're going to do this as a team, okay?

07:09.888 --> 07:10.972
What are we gonna do?

07:11.056 --> 07:13.683
We're going to a very tiny part
of your brain.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.520
- What will we find there?
- The source of your dreams.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.234
I hate to disappoint you, Doctor,
but I never remember my dreams.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.903
Hmm.

07:26.571 --> 07:31.576
But you did dream at least once,
and you have never forgotten that dream.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.704
I bet that's the one you're thinking of.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.459
The dream that never left you.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.632
The one that took the most important
people in your life away from you.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.676
Your parents.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.224
The day they got on that plane.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.643
Remember, Paula? If not, I can continue.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.230
I also dreamed that they came back.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.525
That they hugged me tight.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.780
And that they never left my side again,
and yet all I can remember is their death.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.700
What about Lúcia?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.284
What about her?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.162
Did you ever dream about her?

08:16.913 --> 08:19.916
I dreamt that she was suffering a lot.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.088
How magnificent.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.383
The thought of my daughter suffering
is magnificent to you?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.968
No. No, of course not.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.139
What's magnificent is the resulting energy
when you talk about this subject.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.306
What energy?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.350
Your dreams, Paula.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.770
They release an enormous amount of energy.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.939
I see it all here.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.027
It's so massive,
there's no way to hide it.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.405
Your unconscious mind
is extraordinarily powerful.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.617
Why are you so interested in my dreams?

08:56.578 --> 09:01.374
When I find them,
you'll be the first to know.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.088
This place used to be
a soccer field.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.301
When the epidemic spread…

09:14.429 --> 09:18.391
the bosses put an end to the soccer
and turned this place into a cemetery.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.228
Jussara came back in a coffin.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.692
Along with a bunch of others.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.948
And I asked to see her one last time,
but they wouldn't let me.

09:34.949 --> 09:40.288
They said opening the coffin
could put everyone's life in danger.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.421
The very same day we buried her,

09:49.798 --> 09:52.467
I asked to be made the groundskeeper
here at the cemetery.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.428
That way, I'd be closer to Jussara.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.933
The coffins didn't stop coming.

10:01.559 --> 10:05.021
Altogether, there are 210 coffins
scattered around here.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.650
And they all have
the same thing in common.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.943
What's that?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.237
They're all empty.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.656
How do you know this, sir?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.244
I wanted so badly
to see Jussara one last time,

10:19.327 --> 10:21.496
to hug her, in whatever way I could.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.873
At night, I came here to the cemetery

10:23.957 --> 10:26.418
and dug up her grave
until I found her coffin.

10:26.501 --> 10:29.129
Then I opened it,
and there was nothing inside.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.048
So I did the same thing
with all the other ones, you know?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.341
All empty.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.468
And then they found out what I'd done.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.096
- Who found out?
- I don't know.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.017
He was far away
and shining a flashlight on me.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.354
That's the last thing
I ever saw in my life.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.943
I paid with my eyes for the sacrilege
of desecrating these tombs.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.249
You were a girl, Paula.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.501
You were ten years old.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.129
- You got through security.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.343
- You ran out on the tarmac.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.304
You knew something very bad
was going to happen.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.724
- No, no, no.
- Why? Why?

11:22.807 --> 11:25.310
No, no, no, no, no.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.272
- <i>No, no, no! No, no, no, no!</i>

11:37.322 --> 11:39.616
<i>No.</i>

11:42.410 --> 11:44.287
<i>No, no!</i>

11:44.371 --> 11:46.748
<i>No, no, no!</i>

11:48.667 --> 11:50.669
No!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.566
Impossible.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.626
- Are you okay?

12:32.711 --> 12:34.212
I need to rest.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.598
- Do you need anything?
- No.

12:45.682 --> 12:49.519
Keep left, and you'll reach the station
in 20 minutes.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.688
I'll wait for you here.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.440
- Are you sure?
- Go!

13:01.531 --> 13:03.199
- It's water.
- Thank you.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.851
Who's there?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.325
Come in.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.996
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.834
Just to give you an update, my report
about that clinic will be ready tomorrow.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.670
And?

14:08.598 --> 14:12.018
Paula reported some very suspicious things
about that clinic.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.104
Suspicious how?

14:14.688 --> 14:19.275
There may be a tunnel.
Yeah, an abandoned hospital, a chapel…

14:20.860 --> 14:22.570
It's all very confusing, I know.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.865
She also swears she saw her daughter.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.121
Her daughter? Her daughter that died?

14:35.125 --> 14:37.043
Hey, Marques, have you been drinking?

14:38.294 --> 14:41.339
I just think that, for us to close
the book on this investigation,

14:41.423 --> 14:45.218
we need to at least visit that location,
even if it's just to say that we looked.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.804
Don't you think you're taking this
a little too personally?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.098
This won't end well for you, you know.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.559
Inspector, Paula's a police officer.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.980
I think it might be worse
if we don't go check it out.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.399
I just want to do things properly.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.609
I get it.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.907
But it might be good to assign
someone to work with you on this.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.077
- What do you mean? Like, a partner?
- Yeah.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.456
Someone who can see this story
objectively.

15:14.539 --> 15:18.668
Inspector,
I feel perfectly fit to handle this case.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.546
- It's practically textbook--
- A woman who's crazy, having a breakdown,

15:21.629 --> 15:25.175
who's committed, tells you she saw
her dead daughter, and you believe her.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.343
I don't know.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.055
But don't worry.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.891
Don't worry. I'll go with you myself.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.397
You're free to go now.

16:33.910 --> 16:38.123
FRANZ BAUERT TRAIN STATION 1948

17:36.389 --> 17:38.224
What are you doing here?

17:43.104 --> 17:45.732
Me? I was sleeping.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.238
I don't like this place.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.950
You know, I don't either.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.787
I much prefer
that other place where we were.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.084
What are you talking about?

18:04.793 --> 18:06.378
You were dreaming about me.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.255
Me? Dreaming about you?

18:10.048 --> 18:12.884
Me, you, in your room.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.970
- Alone?
- Sure.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.305
No one can come in here.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.101
- Not even Schultz?
- That depends.

18:21.184 --> 18:24.771
- He can only come in if you let him.
- Shh. Keep it down.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.482
<i>He can hear everything.</i>

18:27.565 --> 18:30.110
- He's here inside my head. I mean it.
- Then forget about him.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.237
He's here. He's listening to everything.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.240
- Forget about him.
- No! I want to leave this place.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.158
- So leave! Leave!

18:38.618 --> 18:41.037
Leave, Paula! Leave!

18:43.081 --> 18:44.082
Leave!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.300
What is this?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.262
Is this your world?

19:08.106 --> 19:10.066
No. Not yet.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.695
- What's going on?

19:15.447 --> 19:19.200
It's your fears, Paula.
They're back. They're chasing you.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.457
- Come with me.
- Where to?

19:26.082 --> 19:27.334
Trust me.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.836
The only way out is to my perfect world.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.422
Come on!

20:02.494 --> 20:05.372
<i>But I'm very glad you came, gentlemen.</i>

20:05.455 --> 20:07.957
This way, we can put this behind us
as soon as possible.

20:09.209 --> 20:13.713
The deactivated ward is about a mile
into the woods.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.925
Nurse Pablo will accompany you there.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.927
I have a meeting.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.971
Okay, Doctor.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.474
Just don't get too far away
from the crime scene.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.892
I'm sorry?

20:26.935 --> 20:27.936
Crime scene?

20:29.813 --> 20:33.024
Crime scene. That's what it's called.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.490
But there was no crime.

20:41.491 --> 20:45.704
Until we can prove that,
there's still a suspicion.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.085
I understand.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.631
But I'm not a suspect.
Not for now, at least.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.761
Then I'll stay here.
If you need anything, Pablo will help you.

21:02.846 --> 21:05.974
Okay. When we're done,
we'll stop by your office.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.143
Maybe drink some whiskey.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.103
Let's go, Marques. Let's go.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.231
My apologies, Doctor.

22:01.696 --> 22:04.449
- Is this the tunnel Mrs. Costa mentioned?
- Yeah.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.452
There's a door at the end
that will give you access to the hospital.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.120
Okay.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.956
We'll take it from here.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.474
Who's there?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.735
Fucking pig.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.276
This is candle wax.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.114
Based on the way it came off of the floor,
it's no more than one or two days old.

25:06.131 --> 25:07.799
Some kind of art project?

25:41.082 --> 25:42.292
It exists.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.344
There's nothing here. Nothing unusual.

26:40.517 --> 26:45.522
This whole place is filthy
except this chapel.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.067
- You don't think that's unusual?

26:49.651 --> 26:52.696
Do you think Schultz came out here
with a mop to clean this place up?

26:53.530 --> 26:54.531
No.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.283
But I think it looks very suspicious.

26:58.201 --> 27:01.955
Marques, this report was filed
by someone who's potentially suicidal,

27:02.038 --> 27:05.291
who is committed to a psychiatric clinic,
whose daughter was burned to death,

27:05.375 --> 27:07.711
and the last thing she saw of her
was her arm.

27:08.211 --> 27:10.255
It's somewhat absurd
to consider the possibility

27:10.338 --> 27:13.717
that Paula may actually have seen
her daughter in this godforsaken chapel

27:13.800 --> 27:17.804
being devoured by a fucking cannibal
who's under round-the-clock surveillance!

27:20.557 --> 27:22.642
Goddamn it, Marques,
what are you doing now?

27:25.603 --> 27:27.105
There's some liquid here.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.943
It smells like
some kind of cleaning product.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.530
It may have been used to clean this place.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.240
Mmm.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.844
Are you done? Can we leave now?

28:42.681 --> 28:44.182
Just one more thing.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.954
Damn it, Marques. You know that crap
is too expensive to waste, right?

29:08.039 --> 29:09.374
Close the door.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.059
Blood on the walls.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.610
This place is a slaughterhouse.
