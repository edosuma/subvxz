WEBVTT

03:33.129 --> 03:35.172
SONNY: You want to know
what this is all about?

03:35.256 --> 03:38.675
You could say
it's about drugs or guns

03:38.760 --> 03:40.802
or disaffected youth,

03:42.513 --> 03:43.889
or whatever you like.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.850
But this whole thing
is about parenting.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.145
It's about taking care
of your children.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.649
You take care of yours,
I take care of mine.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.777
INTERVIEWER: I'm sorry, I don't
understand. What does that mean?

03:56.861 --> 04:00.864
That's all I have to say about
that subject. Next question.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.284
Your son
was a drug dealer?

04:04.452 --> 04:08.580
A drug dealer? No. Did he
sell a little weed? Yeah.

04:08.665 --> 04:13.669
A little weed? He was a major
supplier to the San Gabriel Valley.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.754
I don't know
anything about that.

04:15.838 --> 04:19.382
What about the D.A.'s assertion that
your son got his marijuana from you?

04:19.466 --> 04:21.760
And that you have ties
to organized crime?

04:21.844 --> 04:23.595
What is this
amateur night bullshit?

04:23.680 --> 04:27.140
This isn't an interrogation,
all right?

04:27.225 --> 04:30.060
I'm a taxpayer
and I'm a citizen.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.396
And you are a jerk-off.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.939
Did I tell you that?

04:38.861 --> 04:40.946
TIKO: Come on, Johnny, I don't
let fiend jump in the alley.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.447
If you don't give me
fucking 12 reps,

04:42.532 --> 04:44.783
I'm fucking your mom
and your girl.

04:44.867 --> 04:45.867
FRANKIE: Tell him, Tiko!

04:45.952 --> 04:47.619
What'd you say?
I couldn't hear you.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.122
You say you want
to suck my cock, right?

04:50.206 --> 04:51.415
First you got to grow one.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.709
JOHNNY: Shit, my dick's
so big it's got a knee.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.043
(LAUGHING)

04:55.128 --> 04:57.087
TIKO: Five foot three,
hung like a flea.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.381
Fuck, it's hot
out there.

05:00.883 --> 05:04.136
What are you doing, Elvis?
Is it dark outside?

05:04.220 --> 05:07.556
What? I'm paying you
for a full day, right?

05:10.101 --> 05:11.852
I've been here
since 10:00 this morning.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.145
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

05:13.229 --> 05:15.814
Fuck that shit.
I asked you a question.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.150
Do you see
the fucking moon, Elvis?

05:18.234 --> 05:21.194
It's definitely daylight.
I'll show you my moon.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.533
Johnny, I did everything
that you said.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.579
The house is clean. I went to the store.
There's food and beer in the fridge.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.750
The wash is done. Adolf's fed. The
grass is cut. It's all done, man.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.711
Well, I guess you shouldn't
have finished so fast, huh?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.089
Shut the fuck up.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.008
Never mind that. Never
mind that. Shut the fuck up!

05:43.092 --> 05:44.885
Get back to fucking work.

05:44.969 --> 05:48.597
You want shit to do? Go wash the
floors. Scrub out the toilets.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.850
Or better yet, pick up all
the dog shit in the backyard.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.270
And if you finish too fast,
dump it out...

05:55.355 --> 05:57.105
ALL: And pick it
back up again.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.942
Party's over, man.
Shut the fuck up, Pick.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.571
FRANKIE: I can get you a pooper scooper.
PICK: Why are you so touchy?

06:04.655 --> 06:06.573
That's messed up, man.
JOHNNY: What?

06:07.450 --> 06:11.036
When am I going
to get my money, Elvis? When?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.455
I told you.
I get my check on Thursday.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.332
All right. Well,
how much is the check?

06:15.416 --> 06:17.209
I don't know.
It depends on the hours.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.169
Well, how many hours
did you work, bitch?

06:19.253 --> 06:21.421
I can't remember.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.006
Fucking deadbeat, man.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.717
Go on,
get the fuck out of here.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.012
The walk of shame.
The walk of shame, man.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.223
Yo! What up, little B?

06:31.307 --> 06:34.017
What up, B?
It's 911.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.357
$8,500.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.651
All of it, huh?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.529
Surprise, surprise.
Yeah.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.698
Okay.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.618
So?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.121
So I got this guy.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.874
He wants five.
Plus my regular two.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.878
So I figure
I'm going to need seven.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.714
I don't know, B. I don't...

07:05.383 --> 07:07.759
I don't like having
that much shit out.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.513
I'm going to see my guy on Monday
and I'll clear you right out, man.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.850
He's good for it, Johnny.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.312
You don't need to tell him
I'm good for it, man.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.941
I'm not looking
for any fucking favors, J.T.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.569
If it makes sense, do it.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.863
If not, fuck it.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.788
All right.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.874
We'll try it.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.335
Where are you going, right?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.421
TIKO: That's what
I'm talking about.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.009
But come Friday,

07:49.093 --> 07:50.802
I don't want to hear
any fucking stories.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.265
You won't.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.643
SONNY: Be ready, be ready.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.021
Soft hands, right?
Soft hands.

08:10.281 --> 08:14.326
Nice. Nice. That's major
league stuff right there, baby.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.953
Grab a bat,
and I'll throw you a couple.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.914
Hey.
Hey.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.669
What do you say, Tarzan?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.171
I need seven.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.839
Seven?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.634
Seven? Who?
Bobby "911 ".

08:30.718 --> 08:33.303
Yeah? Well,
we could put together.

08:33.386 --> 08:34.679
I don't want
to get picked off.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.972
All right.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.518
You know where he's been?
Yeah.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.773
I mean, I don't know,
but it feels good.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.194
All right.
It's on you anyway, right?

08:49.278 --> 08:51.363
It always is, Pop.

08:51.447 --> 08:55.200
Hey, look at this kid. How
handsome he is. Look at this!

08:55.284 --> 08:57.410
You must be knocking them
dead. You knocking them dead?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.204
No. Let go of me.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.165
So, what are you doing
tonight? You chasing tail?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.626
No, I'm just chilling.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.878
On a Friday night?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.714
Sonny?
I know. I know.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.260
Don't make me wonder about you, kid.
You sound like half a fucking fag.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.054
Always had my suspicions.
Just make the fucking call.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.890
Wait a minute.
Remember what I told you.

09:18.975 --> 09:24.145
Men are not supposed to be monopolous.
It's in our nature to spread the seed.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.690
Yeah, very poetic.
Come on. Come on.

09:26.774 --> 09:31.611
Angela's a nice girl and all, but
you got to plow some fucking fields!

09:31.696 --> 09:34.447
Did you hear me,
you fucking fruitcake?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.491
Come on, buddy.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.827
He's a great kid.
Yeah, he is.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.348
Hello?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.017
Hey!

11:26.102 --> 11:29.437
We didn't expect
to see you. Come on in.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.941
Hi. You hungry?
Yeah.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.943
There's plenty of food.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.278
Hey.
Hey.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.074
I like your hair, Jakey.
Thank you.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.623
You look handsome with
a little hair. Thank you.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.043
What's going on with the job?
Lot of sales. Really busy.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.338
Just, everything's going
really great.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.716
How's your mother?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.467
Wonderful, thank you.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.720
Tell her I said hello.
I'll do...

12:01.804 --> 12:04.472
And Wanda?
She's fine.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.474
Could I talk to you
for a second?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.561
Yeah, sure.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.981
Excuse us.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.620
I need to borrow money.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.706
I thought we talked
about this.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.374
Yeah.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.084
You haven't paid me back
for the last time.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.295
I know. I'm sorry. I...

12:36.172 --> 12:38.381
It's not the money. You
know that, don't you, Son?

12:38.466 --> 12:41.885
I just can't keep
bailing you out all the time.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.970
I know, man!
I mean, do you...

12:44.638 --> 12:47.974
Do you think I'd fucking be here if
this wasn't the last stop on earth?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.106
How much?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.484
800 bucks.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.111
Hey.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.240
What's going on?
Jake wants to borrow money.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.785
How many times are we
going to do this, Butch?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.036
Kid comes in here
stoned out of his mind,

13:08.120 --> 13:10.622
and you keep throwing money at him
because you don't want to deal with it.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.291
I'm working! I have a job.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.544
I'll pay you back.
No.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.047
No, I can't do it, Son.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.092
Right. Sorry to interrupt. Go
back to your perfect little family.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.761
That's not fair.
Don't fucking touch me!

13:38.567 --> 13:40.944
Hey. Can I come with you?

13:41.028 --> 13:43.404
No, kid, not tonight.
I got some shit to do.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.365
Okay.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.993
Yeah.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.412
You okay? You all right?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.122
Yeah.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.042
Okay, well, page me later.
Yeah. Yeah.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.252
Okay.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.546
I love you.
Yeah.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.630
Yeah.

Look at these
fucking wannabe motherfuckers

14:21.193 --> 14:25.029
with their fucking guns
and their fucking gold chains.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.366
They got nothing!
They're worthless!

14:28.450 --> 14:33.037
The only thing these motherfuckers
are shooting are music videos, dawg.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.664
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.708
That's what
I've been saying all along.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.668
That's what
I'm talking about.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.295
(MUSIC PLAYING)

14:40.838 --> 14:44.465
Now I'm feeling it.
Now I'm feeling it.

14:45.801 --> 14:49.387
Now I'm feeling it, bitches.
You don't want that shit.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.471
No!

14:50.764 --> 14:53.892
You don't want that shit.
You don't want that shit.

You want to call me out? Okay.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.745
Yeah, I want to call you out.

15:13.829 --> 15:17.540
I want to call you out.
I want to call you out.

15:17.666 --> 15:22.670
MAN 1: Oh, that is so nasty!
MAN 2: Hey, you know he has herpes, right?

15:25.841 --> 15:27.175
Bring it on!

15:30.346 --> 15:32.347
I'm fucking high, dawg.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.434
I can't even... I can't even
see you right now.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.186
TIKO: You ain't shit, Elvis!
Go back to your shelf.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.981
Yeah, dance, bitch.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.359
He's so fucking
brain-dead.

Rape her more!

15:47.738 --> 15:48.738

(ALL CHEERING)

15:58.874 --> 16:01.250
I need a fucking beer.

Hey, would you
get me a cerveza?

16:04.546 --> 16:07.131
ELVIS: Oh, you need a beer,
Johnny? I'll get you a beer.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.301
Don't worry about it, Angie.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.095
Yo, I got it, Johnny.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.847
Run, bitch.
Bitch, we're fucking thirsty.

Look at that slave-ass
motherfucker. "I got it, Johnny. "

16:23.232 --> 16:25.942
Yes, he does.
Don't you, Elvis?

16:26.026 --> 16:28.653
What? You love him,
motherfucker. Johnny?

16:28.737 --> 16:31.155
Yeah, I do.
I love him a lot.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.241
(ALL LAUGHING)

16:34.451 --> 16:37.829
I owe him a lot. I do.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.498
No, no, no.
I don't mean like that.

16:40.582 --> 16:43.710
I mean you fucking love him.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.545
You'd fucking do
anything for him.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.132
If he asked you to suck his
cock, you probably would.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.925
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

16:52.011 --> 16:53.344
Shut the fuck up.

Tell the truth, Elvis.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.808
Tell me you wouldn't drop
to your fucking knees

16:58.892 --> 17:01.894
and suck Johnny's cock in
two seconds, if he asked you.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.189
You'd give it a kiss on the tip.
I bet you would, motherfucker.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.150
No, I wouldn't.
You wouldn't?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.234

Dude, you are
a fucking full-on

17:13.073 --> 17:16.159
dick-in-the-mouth,
balls-across-the-nose, dildo-up-the-ass...

17:16.242 --> 17:17.285
Fag!

17:17.368 --> 17:20.038
You're a faggot, dude.
100 percent. You're a fag.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.372
JOHNNY: Shut the fuck up,
bitch. Suck my cock.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.040
You know what? Don't talk
to me anymore, okay?

17:23.125 --> 17:24.876
I fuck bitches. You're a homo.
Suck my cock.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.586
That's it.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.505
That's fucking mean.
Shut the fuck up!

17:29.590 --> 17:31.132
Suck my fucking cock.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.093
Come on, Schmidt,
I'm dead serious.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.762
Suck it, bitch.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.097
Suck my fucking cock.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.558
GIRL: Come on, do it!

17:40.642 --> 17:43.686
No, I got it, all right?
Suck my cock.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.232
Pretty soon it's going
to come out, Elvis.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.943
TIKO: Pretty soon you're
going to come out, Elvis.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.320
That you're fucking gay.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.238
What up, Jake?

17:54.323 --> 17:56.991
You got to start calling a
motherfucker before you just show up.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.202
Christ-killers ain't
got no respect. Yeah.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.413
Can I talk to you for a minute?
FRANKIE: What's up, Jake?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.457
Oh, shit! Yo, come here, man.
Elvis is just about to suck a dick.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.666
Yeah.
Let's go on in here.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.585
So what's going on, homie?

18:07.669 --> 18:11.214
You know that thing I told you I was going
to take care for you down in San Diego?

18:11.298 --> 18:13.758
Yeah.
It's a washout.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.593
Really? What happened?

18:15.677 --> 18:18.304
Well, I go down there
and I put the screws to him.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.889
And I tell him, something bad
is gonna happen to him,

18:19.973 --> 18:22.767
unless he comes up with
your money, and, like, fast.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.769
Which he doesn't,
because he's fucking tapped.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.437
But he's scared,
so he leans on his neighbor,

18:26.522 --> 18:29.190
and I walk on the guy
for 150 bombs.

18:29.858 --> 18:30.900
So?

18:33.445 --> 18:36.489
So, the bombs are no good.
The X was fucking bunk.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.199
And I had a guy lined up
to take it all, man.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.910
We would have made
so much money on that shit.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.289
But you said that you would take care
of it. You said that it was your debt.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.624
Are you coming in here,
trying to nigger-talk me?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.544
What do you want me to do? I can't exactly
go back to the guy that I ripped off

18:49.628 --> 18:50.670
and say, "Yo dude,
your shit was no good. "

18:50.754 --> 18:52.839
Okay, well,
I still got to get paid.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.842
I know. Calm the fuck down.
I got $800.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.303
And I thought
that we could split it.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.305
You thought
we could split it?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.350
Fuck that.
Pay me all of it.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.476
I'm trying.
How?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.436
You make dog shit
at your fucking job.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.938
Be careful, Johnny.
I'm not fucking Elvis.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.273
Yeah, well,
you're short, asshole.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.983
Watch your fucking mouth,
you little fucking midget.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.735
I'm not one of
your little faggot friends.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.696
And remember
who you're talking to.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.698
Give me
my fucking money!

19:19.575 --> 19:21.492
You're going
to stiff me, huh?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.996
I'm going
to fucking kill you!

19:25.372 --> 19:26.747
(SCREAMS)

19:35.174 --> 19:38.718
JAKE: Take a fucking drink,
you motherfucker.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.887
Why don't you fucking die?

19:40.971 --> 19:43.431
I'm going to kill you,
you fucking bitch!

19:43.557 --> 19:45.099
(DOGS BARKING)

19:48.812 --> 19:51.397
Take your fucking
hands off him! Get back!

19:51.481 --> 19:53.149
You motherfucker!

19:53.233 --> 19:56.402
You motherfucker!
You motherfucker!

19:57.946 --> 20:01.032
Oh, fuck, Frankie. Get
this fucking bitch off me.

20:01.116 --> 20:05.536
Fucking psycho, man.
Get the fuck off, bitch!

20:05.621 --> 20:08.414
Who do you think you're messing
with, you fucking cocksucker?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.208
Get away from me.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.168
Sit the fuck down,
you crazy bitch!

20:12.294 --> 20:13.294
Piece of shit.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.130
Whoa, goddamn it, man!
All right, motherfucker!

20:16.215 --> 20:18.883
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, man.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.011
You point that thing at me, you
better pull the fucking trigger!

20:22.095 --> 20:24.305
Well, come on,
you fucking pussy, do it!

20:24.389 --> 20:25.640
Come on, bitch!

20:25.724 --> 20:27.058
(SCREAMING)

20:27.142 --> 20:29.268
Why don't you try me,
you fucking kike?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.771
I will! I will!
I love it.

20:31.855 --> 20:35.233
You have everyone else fooled around
here, but I ain't fucking buying it.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.109
Get this fucking piece
of shit out of my house.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.445
Get the fuck out, dawg!

20:40.155 --> 20:41.656
All right, Johnny.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.576
It's on.
Ain't no turning back now.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.119
Get the fuck
out of here!

20:47.371 --> 20:49.205
Fucking walk away, okay?

20:49.873 --> 20:51.165
Come on.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.834
Whoa!

20:58.465 --> 20:59.840
Fuck me.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.676

(BANGING ON DOOR)

21:05.973 --> 21:07.515
Bitch, shut up.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.689
What's going on?

21:19.695 --> 21:22.113
Who's there?
It's Zack.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.699
Who? It's fucking midnight!
It's me, Zack.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.535
Get in here.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.290
What are you doing,
you fucking maniac?

21:32.374 --> 21:35.167
Hi! Hi!

21:38.046 --> 21:40.506
Okay. Go put on some
clothes. My brother's here.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.800
Heil! Yes, sir!

21:51.393 --> 21:53.602
You want a drink?
Yeah.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.193
And she's always
telling me what to do.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.823
Like what clothes to wear and
what girls she thinks are pretty.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.492
Like I couldn't fucking
figure it out for myself!

22:08.577 --> 22:10.870
That's your mom.
That's Olivia.

22:10.954 --> 22:14.290
Come on, she loves you.
You're her baby.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.208
Yeah, I know.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.210
It's embarrassing.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.340
Do you know that
we have homework parties?

22:22.424 --> 22:25.301
What? Homework parties with little hats.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.969
No.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.387
Yeah.
Like...

22:28.472 --> 22:31.432
Yeah.
... for birthdays?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.559
Yeah! Yeah!

22:33.643 --> 22:35.144
Another thing.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.814
I'll be sleeping, right?

22:40.609 --> 22:43.444
And she'll wake me up
by looking at me.

22:43.528 --> 22:48.616
Like I'll open my eyes, and she'll
be right there looking at me, like...

22:50.494 --> 22:52.036
Fucking A!

22:52.120 --> 22:56.040
It's goddamn creepy, you know. Like she's
in love with me, and breathing on me!

22:56.124 --> 22:57.958
You're lucky, you know that.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.253
I mean, my mother,
she'd never...

23:05.342 --> 23:07.426
Boo-hoo for me!

23:07.511 --> 23:08.928
Yeah, I know.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.848
But, you know,
I'd trade you.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.227
I just got to get out.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.940
Wow, I'm drunk.
I got to smoke.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.610
Well.

23:24.694 --> 23:27.113
Look at Zacky! All grown up!

23:27.948 --> 23:31.617
Look at his little one-hitter
and his stress weed.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.286
Shut up.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.049
Take a drink.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.514
Like a pro.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.937
Wacky Zacky.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.857
That's me.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.317
Wacky Zacky.

OLIVIA: Wanda, put my kid
on the phone. Now.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.874
One minute.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.753
It's Olivia.
No, no. Fucking A!

24:24.838 --> 24:26.338
All right, give it to me.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.177
Hello?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.723
Zack was supposed to be home
two hours ago. Is he with you?

24:36.057 --> 24:39.268
Yeah, he's here.
Fucking A, dude.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.229
No, we're talking.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.523
I said we're talking.
Put him on the phone...

24:44.608 --> 24:47.818
Don't get your panties all in a wad,
Olivia. I'll drive him home later.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.403
Do you know what time it is?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.989
Yes, I do know
what time it is, thank you.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.618
Put my son on the phone or I am coming
over there right now, God damn it.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.869
Yeah, okay.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.830
Yeah, okay. All right!

25:22.854 --> 25:25.314
Jake, am I a funny guy?
You're hysterical.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.234
Am I a good guy?
You're the best.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.777
Yeah?
Yeah, you are a good guy.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.695
You are the best, man.
Oh, boy.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.114
Get inside.
Oh, Dad!

25:36.243 --> 25:38.202
You wanted him,
you got him.

one time, right?

Hey, look at the caboose
on that one.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.198

like a peach.

Cosmo.

are all wrinkled up.

What?

"What?" You deaf fuck.
I said you're old.

26:33.174 --> 26:36.760
I can knock the bottom
out of her.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.014
You don't even know what a bottom
is. You don't know what to do.

Balls deep.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.517
Hey, waitress!

26:43.602 --> 26:46.478
What can I do for you?
What did you have in mind?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.858
Just get another
round of drinks.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.694
You haven't finished the last
ones. I didn't ask you that.

drinks. Get us some drinks, bitch!

are you... Look at this guy.

says we're leaving, let's go!

watch this.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.559
Tell Jake we stopped in.
Oh, I will.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.320
When I told Jake what happened,
he fucking flipped out.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.696
And I had to calm him down.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.114
He was going to kill Johnny.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.116
Jake's like that. He's
a very passionate person.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.204
But I told him, "No. If
you're gonna do something,

27:45.288 --> 27:47.498
"you got to fucking
hit him where it hurts. "

27:47.582 --> 27:50.834
Johnny had a car stolen
by a mutual acquaintance,

27:50.919 --> 27:53.253
and he was trying to collect
on the insurance money.

27:54.464 --> 27:58.008
Jake comes in,
salts the whole fucking deal,

27:58.093 --> 28:00.761
insurance company
catches wind of it,

28:01.429 --> 28:03.180
they don't pay out.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.308
Costs Johnny $30,000.

28:06.393 --> 28:09.728
Of course, Johnny had to
retaliate. It's fucking business.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.897
Mr. Johansson
wants to see you.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.651
You wanted to see me?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.654
Sit down.

28:25.453 --> 28:26.870
What's up, Pete?

28:26.955 --> 28:28.455
Your probation officer called.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.376
You talked to Mr. Lampington?
I thought he was out of town.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.461
Yeah. Well,
I talked to him.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.673
He says you've been getting
into trouble again.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.759
Breaking into houses,
using drugs. Speed, mainly.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.010
It's not true.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.138
Yeah, it is.
No, it's not.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.640
Pete, I swear to God.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.977
Dude. Dude! It's...

28:52.522 --> 28:54.815
I feel you. I'm right here.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.609
Don't look at me that way. I'm
telling you the fucking truth!

28:57.694 --> 29:00.320
I'm totally
fucking straight, man!

29:00.405 --> 29:01.864
I mean, I'm a little...

42:58.617 --> 43:00.451
No what?
He stays with you.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.536
What?

43:01.620 --> 43:03.871
I said, "All fucking queers
are deaf," motherfucker.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.416
Why me, dude?
Because I fucking said so.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.167
Don't fuck around, man.

43:08.252 --> 43:10.920
I can't fucking take him
to my dad's house like that.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.381
Well, then, untie him, genius.

43:13.465 --> 43:15.466
You heard the kid.
He ain't running, are you?

43:15.551 --> 43:17.927
What? No.
There you go.

43:18.012 --> 43:22.765
Go home, tell Juergen he's your new little
butt buddy and he's spending the night.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.851
Meanwhile,
I'll talk to Mazursky.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.689
He must be going crazy
right now.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.696
Hey, what's going on?

43:37.197 --> 43:38.823
It's a madhouse.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.410
Your brother's scaring
the shit out of all of us.

43:42.494 --> 43:46.164
You try his friends?
Maybe he has a girl.

43:46.248 --> 43:50.835
We've tried everything. Friends,
cops, hospitals. Nothing.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.339
You don't think the kid's
just, like, out fucking around?

43:54.423 --> 43:57.258
I mean, you can't keep the kid
locked in the house forever.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.177
Maybe. I don't know.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.597
We did have an argument
this morning.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.974
Okay, well, that's what it is,
then, right?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.601
I hope so.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.103
Well, what do you think?
I don't know.

44:09.188 --> 44:13.650
But, we can't
rule anything out, so...

44:17.237 --> 44:19.489
I have to ask you
a few questions.

44:19.573 --> 44:21.783
Okay?
Okay.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.453
You know anybody
who'd want to hurt Zack?

44:25.537 --> 44:27.121
No.
You?

44:28.082 --> 44:29.082
Me what?

44:29.166 --> 44:31.918
You have a beef with anybody
I should know about?

44:32.711 --> 44:35.171
No.
That person you owe money to?

44:35.255 --> 44:36.714
You owe somebody money?

44:36.799 --> 44:41.094
Oh, Jesus! You just tell me how
much and I will write the check.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.930
It's not really like that,
Olivia. Really? What's it like?

44:44.014 --> 44:48.142
Tell me what it's like, you...
Goddamn you! You fuck!

44:48.227 --> 44:50.687
Get him back here!
Please relax.

44:50.771 --> 44:52.772
Get him back here to me.

44:55.442 --> 44:57.944
Bring him back here!

44:59.571 --> 45:02.490
I'm going to find him,
I promise you.

45:02.574 --> 45:05.201
I promise you.

45:05.285 --> 45:06.661
(SOBBING)

45:06.745 --> 45:08.246
I'll find him.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.886
I don't know, dawg.
Is he here?

45:23.971 --> 45:27.598
That's what I'm asking you,
"dawg"! Excuse me, we were talking.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.144
Klemash, where's the fucking
crew? Man, I ain't seen them dudes.

45:31.228 --> 45:34.105
What the fuck was that? You give
me your back? You turn away from me?

45:34.189 --> 45:36.065
Why are you tripping, homes?
Back up, freak-ass!

45:36.150 --> 45:37.358
Don't touch her!

You fucking asshole!

46:09.224 --> 46:13.853
If anybody
sees Johnny Truelove,

46:15.230 --> 46:19.776
tell them Jake Mazursky
is looking for him!

46:21.695 --> 46:23.029

I'm going to get a beer.
You want one? Yeah, sure.

No, I don't smoke.

It's good for you.

Hey, man,

what if I said you could
walk over there right now,

47:51.243 --> 47:53.578
jump on a bus,
catch a ride home?

47:54.788 --> 47:59.959
I turn my back, tell Truelove
you fucking ran away or something.

48:00.919 --> 48:02.795
What do you think about that?

48:10.971 --> 48:12.054
I don't know, Frankie.

48:12.139 --> 48:16.517
I mean, I don't want to cause any
problems for my brother, you know?

48:17.185 --> 48:21.105
So, I think, I'm just going to
ride it out, see what happens.

48:21.189 --> 48:22.607
All right?

join in the fun, man.

There's coffee. But Destiny got up late,
so I need you to straighten up the house.

I'm supposed to clean up
after your party?

argue with me. I'm in no mood.

You get a job, you pay rent,

50:55.802 --> 50:57.261

Hey, don't worry about it.
I'll help you with the work.

Juergen's a botanist. He grows

sex or... That's disgusting!

going to go down on him?

fucking suck at these games.

You suck. You fucking
blow at this game, dude.

53:49.809 --> 53:52.311

So, how old are you?
How old do I look?

54:26.388 --> 54:28.055
About 12.

some people over.

Nobody. Just some people.

54:56.751 --> 54:58.627

to play fucking grab-ass!

the fuck out of there!

55:02.048 --> 55:04.508
All right. All right.
I'll clear it out.

55:07.887 --> 55:10.431
I need you to do
a favor for me, bro.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.308
Johnny's coming over
and I need the house.

55:12.392 --> 55:14.560
Will you watch the kid for me
for a little while?

55:14.644 --> 55:16.645
Watch him?
Yeah. Keep an eye on him.

55:16.730 --> 55:18.731
No phones
and no leaving him alone.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.482
No phones?

55:21.735 --> 55:23.402
I don't get it.

55:24.446 --> 55:28.449
All right, look. If I tell you something,
can you keep your fucking mouth shut?

55:28.533 --> 55:31.410
Yeah, of course, man. Yeah.

55:33.121 --> 55:35.998
The kid's older brother
owes Truelove money

55:36.082 --> 55:40.127
and Johnny's holding him like a marker
or something, until he gets paid.

55:44.090 --> 55:45.674
That's fucked up.

55:45.759 --> 55:47.801
No. No, bitch,
it's not like that.

55:47.886 --> 55:51.472
The kid knows what's happening,
and he's cool with it.

55:51.556 --> 55:54.516
I mean, look at the motherfucker.
He ain't going nowhere.

55:54.601 --> 55:59.855
Just take him someplace, hang out,
bring him back in a couple of hours.

55:59.939 --> 56:02.232
Can you do that for me?

56:02.317 --> 56:04.193
I don't know, man.

56:06.112 --> 56:08.572
It sounds
pretty fucking dubious.

56:09.282 --> 56:13.160
Keith, who the fuck
are you talking to, man?

56:14.412 --> 56:17.873
If I tell you something's
good, then that's what it is.

56:18.583 --> 56:21.460
Are you going to take
care of this for me or not?

56:22.754 --> 56:24.630
Susan, I swear to God,
it's cool. Trust me.

56:24.714 --> 56:26.882
Would you fucking calm down?
Hey! Fuck you! Let go of me!

56:26.966 --> 56:27.966
You're not supposed to know
any of this.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.385
Jesus, don't say anything,
okay?

56:29.469 --> 56:30.636
You're gonna get me
in a lot of fucking trouble.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.180
From who, Keith? From your little
fucking gangster friends from L.A.?

56:33.306 --> 56:34.264
Yeah! From my...

56:34.349 --> 56:36.350
Oh, I'm real scared!
Well, you fucking should be.

56:36.434 --> 56:38.394
You're a little fucking
faggot, you know that?

56:38.478 --> 56:40.437
Whoa, you guys, dude,
what's going on?

56:40.522 --> 56:43.065
This kid has been kidnapped!
No, he hasn't!

56:43.149 --> 56:46.819
You mean like "abducted"
kidnapped? Fucking stolen! Ask him.

56:48.655 --> 56:49.863
Yeah.

56:49.989 --> 56:51.073
Yeah, they took me. But

56:51.825 --> 56:52.825
it's okay.

56:53.493 --> 56:54.618
They took you? Why?

56:54.702 --> 56:56.787
Because his scumbag brother
owes Johnny Truelove money.

56:56.871 --> 56:57.913
Shut up!

56:57.997 --> 57:00.082
Whoa!
That's fucking hot.

57:00.166 --> 57:02.418
Dude, so you're like ransom
or something.

57:02.502 --> 57:05.254
Yeah. Stolen boy.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.380
Yeah.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.425
You don't look stolen.
Yeah.

57:11.010 --> 57:12.636
I know. It's weird.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.222
Dude, I want you to know that you
can do anything you want, okay?

57:15.306 --> 57:16.557
No, he can't!
I don't play that shit.

57:16.641 --> 57:18.434
You want to fucking leave, go
for it. You want make a call...

57:18.518 --> 57:20.602
You shut the fuck up,
you fucking bitch!

57:20.687 --> 57:22.688
I'm a fucking bitch?
You're a fucking little bitch!

57:23.273 --> 57:25.357
Guys! Whoa! Fuck!

57:25.817 --> 57:28.652
Hey! Hey! Hey! Sit down
right now, you fucking bitch!

57:28.736 --> 57:31.530
I'm gonna knock your ass out.
Keith, fucking chill out!

57:31.614 --> 57:33.282
God, my brother is...

57:33.366 --> 57:35.784
My brother is gonna
pay the money, okay?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.327
See?

57:37.412 --> 57:39.913
So, like, in the meantime,
you're, like, on vacation.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.458
Yeah. Exactly. Why not?
That's fucking awesome.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.793
It's, like, another story
to tell my grandkids.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.462
Dude, that is so fucking cool.

57:46.546 --> 57:50.299
Dude, this shirt is fucking
cool. Bob Marley is cool.

57:50.383 --> 57:52.259
You guys think
that kidnapping is cool?

57:52.343 --> 57:54.928
Yeah, Susan,
it's fucking exciting!

57:55.013 --> 57:57.639
I think it's romantic, dude,
he's doing this for his brother.

57:57.724 --> 58:00.267
Are you insane?
Susan, chill out.

58:00.351 --> 58:02.853
Dude, this is fucking wrong!

58:02.937 --> 58:05.939
Doesn't anybody else think
that this is fucking wrong?

58:06.024 --> 58:10.444
No! Susan, take a fucking Valium! Okay?

58:10.570 --> 58:13.071
It's not even any of your
business. No! It is my house!

58:14.282 --> 58:17.534
Jesus Christ,
calm the fuck down. All right.

58:17.619 --> 58:20.829
I'm going to roll us the biggest
fucking joint anyone has ever seen.

58:20.914 --> 58:23.749
You down with that, Zack?
Absolutely.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.149
Hey. What's up,
you blunted faggot?

58:49.234 --> 58:51.652
What's up,
you short bitch?

58:51.736 --> 58:55.113
Make yourself busy, baby.
We got to talk some business.

58:55.907 --> 58:58.200
Can I get you guys a drink? PiÃ±a Colada?

58:58.284 --> 59:00.869
It's not a bar, baby. There's
no fucking PiÃ±a Colada.

59:00.954 --> 59:01.995
Not even a little can?

59:02.080 --> 59:04.581
No, but I got some wine.
I can make you a spritzer.

59:04.666 --> 59:05.874
Okay.

59:11.881 --> 59:13.298
Sit down.

59:13.716 --> 59:15.926
What's the fucking deal?

59:16.010 --> 59:17.886
I don't know what to do.

59:17.971 --> 59:21.014
What do you mean?
About the kid.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.517
We could be
in a lot of trouble.

59:23.601 --> 59:25.060
Trouble?
Yeah.

59:25.144 --> 59:28.063
Big-ass,
serious-as-shit trouble.

59:28.147 --> 59:31.817
I mean, you can't just take
a kid and have no one notice.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.820
That's what I told you.
Didn't I say that?

59:34.904 --> 59:36.572
You did, all right?
Fuck!

59:36.656 --> 59:40.742
But, still, we are where we
are. Right here, you know?

59:42.161 --> 59:44.871
I mean, it's a big problem
and we got to fix it.

59:47.166 --> 59:49.751
So what do we do?
I don't know.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.628
There's an answer here.
There's, like, a solution.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.755
But I'm just...
I'm just not seeing it.

59:55.508 --> 59:57.634
I don't know.
Maybe we're fucked.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.512
We're not fucked.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:04.516
What do you mean, fucked?
Jail fucked, motherfucker.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.936
If we let the kid go, he runs back
to Mommy and Daddy and he rats us out.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.105
Maybe he won't.
Not to mention Tattooey.

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:11.857
Who knows what that crazy
motherfucker is gonna do?

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.234
We're all gonna be looking
over our fucking shoulders.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:17.779
I don't think the kid
will spill. I really don't.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.698
Yeah, but what if he does?

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.538
Fuck that shit.
You see what I'm saying?

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:29.207
I'm not fucking going to
prison! Look, I just won't.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.543
Yeah. Me neither, bitch. What the
fuck you think I'm talking about?

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.963
I'm not fucking kidding, John.
This is really fucking bad.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:38.091
The best thing we could do would
be to get ahold of Tattooey,

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.968
and to straighten him and all
this shit out once and for all.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.345
Well, where is
that motherfucker?

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.347
Who the fuck knows, man?
I don't know.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:46.058
He's probably laying low, looking
to shoot me in the fucking head.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.684
I mean, think about it.
That's what I'd be doing.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:51.563
Stop already, all right! You know
how I get with this anxiety shit.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:00.739
(COUGHING)

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.742
Frankie?

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:09.164
Frankie?
Yeah.

01:01:09.957 --> 01:01:12.626
I swear to God, man,
I'm hyperventilating.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.089
I want to ask you something.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.008
What? Fuck.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.593
Hypothetically, all right?

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.846
This isn't real, right?
We're just talking here.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.431
But...

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:32.145
What would you say if I were to
offer you $2,500 just to kill the kid?

01:01:34.982 --> 01:01:36.525
Kill him?

01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:38.652
Yeah, fucking wax him.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.450
Are you fucking insane?

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.121
I'm not going to fucking kill the
kid. That's a fucking joke, right?

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:52.541
Of course it's a fucking joke,
man! You're so fucking stupid.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:55.544
You're an asshole, man! All
right, man, I'm just playing.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.504
Well, stop fucking around.

01:01:57.588 --> 01:02:01.258
Look, man, can't we just
grease the kid?

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:05.512
You know tell him he can hang
out anytime. That he's our boy.

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:08.098
Throw a fucking arm around him
or something.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:10.934
Give him a few bucks?
Right.

01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:12.978
And tell him
when Mommy and Daddy ask,

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.564
to say that he ran away
with some girl or something.

01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:16.898
Yeah, maybe, yeah.
I mean, look...

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.401
I mean, we'd have to get the story
straight, but we can make it work, man.

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:21.778
I know we could. We just
grease the kid. Yeah.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.572
And then it's taken care of.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:27.659
And that way we're not running around
here like a bunch of fucking Chinamen.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.912
Done.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.415
See, that's what I love
about you, man.

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:35.333
You're smarter than me.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.503
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.322
Fuck!

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:16.041
Whoa, whoa.
Let me see that.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.376
Come here.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.385
Does it hurt?
No.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.144
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.406
Could I talk to you alone
for a minute?

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:58.917
What's up?

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.968
I just wanted to say
sorry about all this shit.

01:04:08.052 --> 01:04:10.804
You know, I know that
this is a big pain in the ass.

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:14.057
This whole thing
is really fucking ridiculous.

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:16.977
Yeah.
Are you okay?

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:20.772
I mean, is everybody treating you all
right? I mean, you got enough to eat?

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.357
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:26.111
You need anything?
You need some dough?

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.320
No, I'm good.

01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:31.366
Are you sure? I mean, I... No,
no, I'm really good. Really.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.034
I mean, I know this is hard,

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:37.372
but this is all going to get squared
away soon, you know, I promise.

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:39.124
All right, cool.

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:44.087
All right.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.132
I got to jet, but...

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.345
You know something?
You know, you're...

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.682
You're a pretty stand-up guy.

01:04:55.766 --> 01:04:58.894
Thanks. I mean, your
brother is a dickhead.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:02.522
I mean, he's my boy and I love
him, but he's just, you know...

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:05.317
I mean, he's acting a motherfucking
fool right now, you know.

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:08.695
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.

01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:10.280
Well...

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:13.909
Anyways, tomorrow.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.454
This will all be over
by tomorrow.

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:47.442
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.320
(PANTING)

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:53.323
Hi.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.285
Hey, baby. What's up? I thought
you were spending the night out.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.079
I was. I just...

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.790
I really needed to talk.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.792
Talk?
Yeah.

01:06:04.877 --> 01:06:07.212
What, now?
Kind of.

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:10.924
One night. I ask for one night
out of the whole fucking year

01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:13.551
to make love to your father and
you won't even give that to me?

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.721
I'm X-ing right now. I can't
understand anything you're saying.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.224
I'm sorry, Mom, okay?
Fuck!

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:25.438
He was wearing a brown shirt, a
blue sweatshirt, brown tennis shoes

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:28.233
and his grandfather's ring.
It has a red stone.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.568
Baby, you got a phone call.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.404
I'll take it upstairs.

01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:33.905
Okay.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:36.116
Excuse me.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.294
Hello. Hello.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:51.798
Yo. It's me.
The midget.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.095
You got some set of balls
calling me here.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.305
What's the matter? You don't
answer a motherfucking page?

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:03.184
We got nothing to talk about.
Oh, I think we do, don't you?

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:05.103
Straighten out all this
shit once and for all?

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:07.272
There's nothing to straighten out,
motherfucker. I know it was you.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.107
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:12.277
Johnny, I know. I know!

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.197
And you're dead.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.700
Don't threaten me.
Fuck that! It's a promise.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:23.621
No matter where you go, no matter what
you do, I'm going to hunt you down.

01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:27.292
I'm going to hunt you down, and
then I'm going to slit your throat

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.918
and then I'm going
to cut you open

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:31.880
and then I'm gonna eat
your motherfucking heart!

01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:33.048
You better pray!

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:38.511
Johnny, you better fucking pray
that the cops find you before I do!

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:42.891
Get on your cocksucking knees
and pray!

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.646
Hello? Hello?

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:57.989
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Mr. Nolder, Johnny Truelove on two.

01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:01.117
Hey, Cock and Balls,
what can I do for you?

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.619
Question for you.

01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:06.247
Let's say, someone owes someone
I know money and won't pay.

01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:08.833
So that someone I know

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:12.754
has his boys snatch the deadbeat's
kid brother till does he does pay.

01:08:13.005 --> 01:08:15.715
What kind of problems is
he looking at? Big ones.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.343
If he asks for ransom,
he's looking at life.

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:24.390
Hello? You there, Cock?

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.393
Life?
Life, yeah.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:34.192
So what does he do?
I don't know.

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:39.613
Probably digs a deep hole. Why?
What's the matter? Who's in trouble?

01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:44.410
SUSAN: What the hell
is he still doing here?

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.537
FRANKIE: You got to
chill the fuck out, Susan.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.247
I mean, you keep
running your fucking mouth,

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:51.042
Truelove could go to jail
and we can wind up dead.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:55.046
Fuck you, all right. You don't
know. That motherfucker's crazy.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:59.759

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.258
That's right. What the
fuck are you talking about?

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:56.971
What the fuck?

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.222
The kid ain't going home.

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:01.642
But I thought Johnny was
going... Well, you thought wrong.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:06.105
Fuck that. Johnny didn't tell me
shit. The decision's been made.

01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:07.231
Fuck you.

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:11.151
Fuck me? Fuck you!

01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:13.445
Johnny sent me here
to take care of something

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.907
and I'm gonna fucking do it
with you or through you!

01:23:21.746 --> 01:23:24.248
Who's sucking
whose cock now, huh, Frankie?

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:27.292
Fuck that! I'm out.
Fuck that? You're fucking in.

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:30.087
I'm up here to clean up your mess,
and you're gonna fucking help me,

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.214
or the whole world is gonna
come down on your head.

01:23:32.298 --> 01:23:34.633
All right!
Fucking let go of me!

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:41.306
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:06.123
Fuck that!
You're gonna dig.

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:07.624
Dig this, bitch!

01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:11.754
You're gonna do it. You're gonna
help me. Fuck that! No fucking way.

01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:14.923
Ain't no fucking way, Elvis.
I'm not digging.

01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:18.802
Fuck you! I did my shit. This
is the line, motherfucker!

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:22.139
Everybody's got one and mine's
a fucking grave, all right?

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:26.560
You want to shoot me? Shoot me right
fucking here. I don't give a fuck!

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.362
Hey, excuse me?

01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:58.133
Where's Frankie?
I need a ride home.

KEITH: Whoa.

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:22.157
What's going on, man?
ELVIS: Come on, I need your help.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.496
What the fuck do you need
duct tape for, dude?

01:25:33.002 --> 01:25:34.503
Where is everybody?

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:38.382
Keith said he needed a ride
home, so that guy gave him one.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:44.138
What are you watching?

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.723
Austin Powers.
All right.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:51.687
Shit's so funny.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:57.025
This shit's been going on for,
like, I don't know, two minutes.

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:10.247
You wanna run to the store
for me? Get me some cigarettes?

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:13.375
Dude, I'm too young
and they won't sell to me.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.306
Let's take a drive, let's
go somewhere. You want to?

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:30.434
No, I'm cool.
I just want to watch a movie.

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:33.645
Okay.

What did you do?
Nothing.

01:26:50.246 --> 01:26:51.872
Are you all right?
She's fine.

01:26:51.956 --> 01:26:53.373
We're going in the other room,
we need to talk.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.666
Fuck that.
It is my birthday.

No, we're going right now!
Don't you fucking touch me!

Hey, the party's over,
wait a second. Fuck!

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.423
You don't talk to your mother like
that. We're trying to help you!

01:27:01.507 --> 01:27:03.258
Where's the kid?
Who?

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.803
Where's Mazursky? I don't
know who you're talking...

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.598
Dad, I swear.
Fucking get off me!

01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:14.394
You're fucking stupid! Stupid, John!
Don't you fucking get it, you moron?

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:17.064
There's a Missing Persons
poster on every street corner!

01:27:17.148 --> 01:27:18.357
You're in deep shit, Johnny.

The cops pick you up,
you're doing 25 to life.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:23.779
You don't think I know that?
You've fucked your life up so bad.

01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:27.074
The only way you're going to unfuck
it is that you come clean now, John.

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:29.660
You come clean now!
Calm down, calm down.

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:33.830
Let me talk to him, all right?
Come on, let me talk to him.

Look, everybody's
getting excited here.

01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:40.045
What your father's trying
to say is we have a plan.

01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:42.631
You bring the kid home,
we have a sit-down.

01:27:42.715 --> 01:27:45.050
Me, you, the mother,
the father, everybody.

01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:47.844
Sonny brings his checkbook,
and we settle it right there.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.430
That will never work.
I'm not saying it will.

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:52.266
You're probably looking
at some jail time.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.934
But if that's
our only option,

01:27:54.018 --> 01:27:56.687
I'll walk you right through
custody, we'll do it the right way.

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.939
I guarantee you do
minimum sentence.

01:27:59.023 --> 01:28:02.359
Be smart, kid. Let the
spooks do the hard time.

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.194
Fuck that. No jail.

Two years? A piece of cake. Winter,
summer, winter, summer, done.

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.535
No. Then you tell us
your plan, Einstein.

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:15.163
You tell us
how this all turns out.

01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:19.960
Hey, Keith, what's up?
I fell.

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:21.211
You fell?

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:24.923
Hey.
Don't fucking touch me.

You're Zack, right?
Yeah.

Well, I'm Elvis and I'm
going to take you home, man.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.076

You got to do this, man.

01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.291
It's got to be unanimous.

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:05.088
If the kid goes home,
everybody's looking at life.

01:29:05.923 --> 01:29:08.008
Life?
Life.

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:14.598
We talked to a lawyer, man,
and there's no way around it.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.105
Life for what?
For taking care of the kid?

01:29:23.441 --> 01:29:25.525
For letting him sleep
at my fucking house?

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.110
You were there
from square one.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:30.947
You sat on him the whole fucking
time. You think you're going to walk?

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:33.950
Goddamn. Life?

01:29:34.952 --> 01:29:36.453
There it is.

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:42.876
I mean, I like the kid.

01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:47.339
What's not to like?

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:49.549
He's 15.

01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:53.512
He's just too much
of a liability.

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:58.308
Think about it. We send the kid
home, you got Jake looking for you.

01:29:58.393 --> 01:29:59.434
You don't want that.

01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:03.438
You don't go along, then Johnny don't
trust you and he's coming after you

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:07.818
and you sure as shit don't want
Sonny Truelove knocking at your door.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:11.613
We don't have a choice, man.

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:29.756
God, my parents
are going to fucking kill me.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.592
I can just see my mom.
She's fucking...

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:37.013
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:30:39.475 --> 01:30:42.394
But, hey, guys, listen,

01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:45.313
I would never
rat you guys out.

01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:50.318
You guys and me are like... We're
like this. You know that, right?

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:52.863

right?

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.407
Yeah, we know that, man.

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.534
Right. Cool.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:02.956
I'm probably
just going to say that I...

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.668
I don't know, that I ran
away or something to, like,

01:31:06.919 --> 01:31:10.172
Bakersfield or Fresno
or something.

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:12.424
Fuck it, you know?

01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:16.261
Hey, does anybody know
where Bakersfield is?

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:20.932
Say you were with a girl.
They'll believe that.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.479
Yeah, like Julie.

01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:44.831
You know, when I get back, I'm
going to start fresh. You know that?

01:31:45.082 --> 01:31:50.003
Like, I just want to start completely
fresh. You ever feel like that, Frankie?

01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:51.588
What's up?
Like...

01:31:51.797 --> 01:31:55.008
Like, I don't know. Like you want to,
I don't know, go to Europe or something.

01:31:55.092 --> 01:32:00.222
Or take a class, or something like that.
Or learn to play an instrument. Like guitar.

01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:03.725
It sounds really fucking hard.
I mean, it's guitar.

01:32:03.809 --> 01:32:08.063
But it bugs me that I don't know
how to do anything, you know.

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:10.857
I'm pretty sure I could.

01:32:15.321 --> 01:32:16.321
Yeah.

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:23.078
Johnny, call it off.
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:32:23.162 --> 01:32:26.373
These guys are such fuck-ups, the
kid's probably loose right now.

01:32:26.457 --> 01:32:27.791
Make the fucking call!

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.048

01:32:35.132 --> 01:32:37.300

who's gonna take you home.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.677
Oh, cool.

01:33:02.201 --> 01:33:05.954
You know, I think I'm going to
start being nicer to my mom.

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:12.669
It's kind of gay, but if you
think about it, she's the shit.

01:33:12.878 --> 01:33:16.339

in the whole world, you know?

with him?

Oh, man! All right, you
ready? Let's do this.

01:34:57.608 --> 01:35:00.026
Oh, man, please, I didn't do
anything. Move it. Shut the fuck up.

Relax! Move, move, move.

Relax, buddy, relax, okay?

01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:07.158
It's not what you think, okay?
Yeah, it is, Frankie!

01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:09.536
Please, I thought we
were boys. We are boys.

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.163
Frankie, there's nobody up
there! Nobody is picking me up!

01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:15.750
Yes, there is, okay. Just stop
freaking out. Frankie, you promise?

01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:17.001
I promise, all right?
Do you swear?

my life, okay, I swear to God.

a walk. Come on, man.

Frankie? Oh, please! I won't tell
anybody, I swear to God, Frankie!

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:42.193
Hey, we're not gonna do this, right?
We're not really gonna do this.

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.154
Shut your fucking mouth!
We're not gonna do this?

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.698
If you want to live, shut your
mouth. Please, mister! Please!

This is fucking stupid, man.

I swear I won't tell
my mom or anything!

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:54.706
Shut his fucking mouth
or I'll fucking shoot him!

I mean it! I'll fucking shoot
him! All right! All right!

to calm down, all right?

Okay?
Okay.

I don't want to die, Frankie.

01:36:07.636 --> 01:36:09.304

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:19.022
What's the tape for,
Frankie?

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:26.237
I would never hurt you,
Zacky, all right? Okay.

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:30.366
But I'm going to have to tape
you up. So give me your hands.

01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:33.912

want to get hit.

Shot. Killed. Murdered.

I happen to know he owes
$50,000 to one drug dealer.

They have their own rules
in the drug world.

for $1,200.

You know, all three times I tried to
commit suicide, there was alcohol involved.

When I tried to kill myself in
the hospital, I did it wrong.

You know, you're supposed
to do it like this.

01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:44.078
