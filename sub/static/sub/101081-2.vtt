WEBVTT

00:50.342 --> 00:54.764
pay your due?

01:21.123 --> 01:23.709
MARISSA:
Vesuvius. 2468. Control.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.920
I'm back in town. I'll be
returning to the company.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.838
And I'd like
a full domestic clean.

01:47.358 --> 01:52.279
this Wednesday?

01:52.321 --> 01:57.159
he flew

02:43.998 --> 02:45.958
-

02:46.000 --> 02:49.420
-Nice, Kelly!
-Yes, go, go, go! Come on!

02:49.461 --> 02:51.297
-That's it!
-Go, go, go!

02:51.338 --> 02:52.756
All right,
let's do this, come on!

03:16.614 --> 03:18.198
That's $5.91.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.950
HELEN:
What are you reading?

03:19.992 --> 03:21.952
-JULES: This.
-W-What is it?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.829
Just, like, the most
important book ever.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.874
-What's it about?
-The death of youth.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.670
-Doesn't matter.
-What do you read, Sandy?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.756
Oh, you know.
Mainly magazines, I guess.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.674
HELEN:
Oh, did you see this?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.260
She's an actress.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.304
She looks amazing.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.306
God, I love her skin.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.183
-Oh, come on, Helen.
-What?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.018
They're fake. Look at them all.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.145
Phony smiles, phony tans.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.147
You can talk about fake.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.732
JULES:
Fuck that.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.859
I'm way more real
than they'll ever be.

03:55.653 --> 03:58.322
HELEN:
Well, I'm getting a coffee.

03:58.364 --> 03:59.782
Anyone?

04:03.661 --> 04:05.996
Did you see that car earlier?

04:06.038 --> 04:07.998
-What car?
-It came in this morning.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.917
They're always coming in
with deliveries.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.920
This was no delivery.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.589
I think someone's back.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.870
-Welcome back.
-Thanks, Kim.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.420
Everything okay?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.423
Yes. It was
a challenging mission.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.258
But it's done?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.219
Not quite,
but we're getting there.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.222
Well, we had good cover
while you were gone.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.974
Langley sent her.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.393
She has full authorization.
I assumed you knew.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.437
Yes, of course.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.026
Marissa Wiegler,
head of section.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.070
Sonia Richter.
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.537
-Thanks, Kim.
-Mm-hmm.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.673
LEO:
Okay, so, the first thing
I want to do is lose the muscle.

05:39.715 --> 05:44.678
But I have to be sure you're not
gonna try to rip my head off.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.182
Are you gonna try
to rip my head off?

05:50.225 --> 05:53.562
I'll take that as a no.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.816
Guys, you can go. Wait outside.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.447
Just go.
We're gonna be fine here.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.000
So,

06:15.042 --> 06:19.338
what that lady told you
in the hotel in Bucharest

06:19.379 --> 06:21.006
is the truth.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.177
Your mother is dead.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.681
I'm really sorry.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.606
It hurts, right?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.651
That's why none
of the girls here

06:40.692 --> 06:42.319
have been told
about any of that.

06:42.361 --> 06:45.489
About parents or any kind
of previous life.

06:45.531 --> 06:50.494
See, the truth is, without us,
none of you would be alive.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.747
I'm not gonna sugarcoat that
for you. Okay?

06:56.750 --> 07:01.130
If you want any life at all,

07:01.171 --> 07:03.173
it has to be here.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.180
What happened to Hanna?

07:14.059 --> 07:18.021
Hanna tried to kill the people
we sent to pick her up.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.900
There was a lot of firepower.
We were forced to respond.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.572
I'm afraid she didn't make it.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.705
It's not your fault.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.540
Hanna chose to break
into the facility.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.750
Her decision, not yours.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.975
It's okay.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.770
It's okay.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.861
I'm okay.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.488
We're good.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.297
Can I show you something?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.221
This way.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.478
This is Larry. Say hi, Larry.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.521
Hi.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.736
LEO:
Recognize them?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.905
Where are they?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.617
They're right here.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.121
-Oh, my God!

08:58.163 --> 09:01.541
Oh, my God...

09:01.583 --> 09:03.293
SONIA:
She arrived back in Paris

09:03.335 --> 09:06.046
at 1500 hours,
flew into Orly Airport.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.048
She returned to the offices
this morning.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.675
I've sent over all visuals.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.260
CARMICHAEL:
Did anyone come see her?

09:11.301 --> 09:14.096
No one.
I think her boyfriend's left.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.223
Other than that,
everything seems normal.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.392
Let me tell you
something, Sonia.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.394
When I taught Marissa Wiegler
at the training college,

09:20.435 --> 09:22.479
no one noticed her
for two years.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.107
She was just average,
slept with a couple guys,

09:25.148 --> 09:26.942
smoked a little dope,
did the bare minimum.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.694
Final exams,
she was top of her class.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.113
No one saw it coming.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.864
So you stay on her.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.284
Watch her
very carefully, please.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.327
Anything strange, you call me.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.699
Fuck.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.771
Find it okay?

10:47.647 --> 10:50.275
-I brought food.
-I'm not hungry.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.614
Okay, then. Shall we do this?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.863
Arms straight.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.203
Good.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.138
Hello, Mary. Is that you?

12:01.179 --> 12:03.223
-MARISSA: Hi, Mr. Kaladski.
-

12:03.265 --> 12:05.058
Please don't call me that.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.935
I haven't been your teacher
for 20 years.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.728
I just wondered
if you'd thought about

12:08.770 --> 12:10.814
what I asking you
a few days ago.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.108
Because the girl
I was telling you about

12:13.150 --> 12:14.776
is with me now.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.278
Her name is Beatrice.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.448
Say hi, Beatrice.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.032
Hi.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.076
Uh, hi there, Beatrice.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.120
Uh, Tom, Beatrice is in danger.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.456
She needs somewhere
that she can go.

12:27.497 --> 12:31.793
Somewhere that's
remote and safe.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.628
You know the line
of work I'm in.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.338
You know what it involves.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.174
You know that I wouldn't make
a call like this

12:37.215 --> 12:39.176
unless I really needed
your help.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.344
Did you speak to Jean?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.263
Yeah, I-I spoke to her.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.764
And?

12:44.806 --> 12:48.560
She wants to know
how long it would be for.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.813
A long time.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.566
And-and I-I suppose
we can't ask who she is.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.402
It's better if you don't.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.738
Just think of her as a girl

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
who deserves a fresh start.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.997
:
The dangers facing mankind

13:09.039 --> 13:11.625
in the 21st century

13:11.666 --> 13:13.835
require radical action.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.882
Sometimes pre-emptive action
that will guarantee

13:18.924 --> 13:21.801
all our security.

13:21.843 --> 13:26.306
That's why Utrax was created.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.893
To be the preventive force
that the world needs.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.659
-

13:54.334 --> 13:55.835
Hi.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.879
Can I come in?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.674
I can come back later.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.717
No, it's okay.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.888
Did you have a long journey?

14:06.930 --> 14:09.307
I think I saw you arrive
in the car.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.476
Where are we?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.687
The Meadows.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.730
But where is that?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.112
SANDY:
Oh, cool, they gave you these.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.697
They're really cool.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.241
Cooler than mine.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.994
My name's Sandy now,
by the way.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.078
Sandy?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.413
Like a beach?

14:31.454 --> 14:34.374
I guess, if the beach is sandy.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.130
Do you have a name?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.764
"Clemency."

14:49.806 --> 14:51.808
That's so sweet.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.817
They're so beautiful.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.527
Have you written to them?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.321
You should.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.864
I write every day to my family.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.408
Almost.

15:08.450 --> 15:12.037
Well, you should only do it
if you feel ready.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.123
I have to go to piano now.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.167
So, I'll see you later.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.671
It's good to have you back.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.610
Sonia?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.654
Have a look at this.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.535
Okay, let me guess the routine.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.538
You call John Carmichael
once a day.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.415
Maybe when you go
to get coffee for the team.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.167
I've noticed
you like to do that.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.503
You call and you report
on my movements.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.380
You include in your report
my domestic routine,

17:27.422 --> 17:30.675
as catalogued by those two
clowns outside my apartment.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.343
You think maybe I'm about
to meet a journalist

17:32.385 --> 17:34.179
or police even.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.016
Maybe I'm about to betray Utrax.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.310
Tell Carmichael this.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.021
I'm not betraying anyone.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.815
I'm tired and lonely.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.067
My boyfriend left me
while I was chasing Erik Heller

17:48.109 --> 17:49.486
across half of Eastern Europe,

17:49.527 --> 17:51.029
and I am now trying
to get him back.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.530
During which time
I would very much appreciate

17:52.572 --> 17:53.990
some fucking privacy.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.246
I have Carmichael's number
on this card.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.333
I will call him if I want.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.085
And in the meantime,
if I see your face again

18:06.127 --> 18:07.670
around my private life,

18:07.712 --> 18:09.172
I'll rip it off
and mail it to him.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.303
Agency or, uh...

18:57.345 --> 18:58.471
personal?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.563
I need a few more days
to organize this.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.695
Keep away from the windows
at all times.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.738
Don't answer the phone
or the doors, okay?

19:18.449 --> 19:20.451
Hanna?

19:21.786 --> 19:23.079
They think you're dead.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.748
You have to stay that way.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.586
It's a whole new life
I'm offering you.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.213
No one will know
where you've gone.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.299
He's an old teacher of mine,
no other connection.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.759
No one will trace you.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.183
I know Erik offered you this.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.477
But he couldn't deliver it,
and I can.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
Where did they take Clara?

19:53.985 --> 19:55.945
No idea,
but I know there's nothing

19:55.987 --> 19:57.989
that you can do for her now.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.717
Oh.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.802
Just thought I'd say hi.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.262
-Sorry.
-Oh, please.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.513
Don't bother.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.765
My mother said I was always

20:23.806 --> 20:25.016
the messiest pup in the litter.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.559
-I'm John Carmichael.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.353
Terri Miller, sir.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.730
You come very highly
recommended.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.273
Well, I hope to not disappoint.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.359
I see you're watching
our latest arrival.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.526
Yeah.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.864
Who is she?

20:39.906 --> 20:42.617
Just someone
we lost for a while.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.077
"Lost"?

20:44.118 --> 20:45.912
She's a rebel, I guess,
but like God,

20:45.954 --> 20:48.206
we value our rebels highly.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.541
You did really good work
on her material.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.669
Big family-- generous,
but not holier than thou.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.754
-Just what she needs.
-It's the kind of the family

20:54.796 --> 20:56.422
I would've dreamed of as a kid.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.216
Brothers and sisters everywhere.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.801
Ah, you're an only child?

20:59.842 --> 21:01.010
Yeah.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.470
Loved but lonely.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.978
We just need
to give her more time.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.863
and out of tune...

21:20.905 --> 21:23.032
So, I think I did something

21:23.074 --> 21:24.909
that was maybe a bit stupid.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.911
What did you do?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.329
JULES:
I split up with Aaron.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.455
Oh, my God.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.957
Why?

21:30.999 --> 21:33.167
I-I thought you liked him.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.586
I changed my mind.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.213
your vitamin...

21:37.255 --> 21:40.133
Wow.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.760
What?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.971
How did you do it?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.306
I messaged him, obviously.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.308
Well, what did he say?

21:49.350 --> 21:52.395
He was really upset.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.981
And then Mom tried
to change my mind.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.441
Whoever Mom is.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.734
I can't believe you did that.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.027
I thought Aaron was so hot.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.153
You like him so much,

22:00.194 --> 22:02.280
you fucking go out with him.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.032
You curse too much.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.742
I what?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.618
I don't understand you, Jules.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.787
I mean, why make
everything so difficult?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.456
Now they have
to find you another guy.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.832
What if I don't want
another guy?

22:12.874 --> 22:15.293
What do you mean?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.421
Why does it always
have to be about guys?

22:18.463 --> 22:21.591
Haven't you read
anything, Sandy?

22:21.632 --> 22:25.428
Like... in here they have

22:25.470 --> 22:27.388
this absurd hetero-normal notion

22:27.430 --> 22:29.640
about who we should be.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.267
It's, like, totally 1950s.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.561
What?

22:33.603 --> 22:35.980
How do you know anything
about the 1950s?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.356
-Forget it.
-No...

22:37.398 --> 22:38.900
Sandy, leave it.

22:38.941 --> 22:42.278
Go back to your dead-eyed
magazine world.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.698
Leave me to expand my mind.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.576
I expand my mind.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.161
All the time.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.205
Sure you do.

24:43.774 --> 24:47.195
Uh, le café, le café...

25:57.515 --> 25:59.517
Chloe?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.784
MAN:
Stand by! Engage!

27:03.289 --> 27:06.250
-Engage!
-

27:08.294 --> 27:10.004
You seen Sandy?

27:10.046 --> 27:12.757
I think she's at music now.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.425
But she'll be in the cafe later.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.221
MAN:
Group! Clear your weapons!

27:26.520 --> 27:28.647
WOMAN:
That'll be two dollars, please.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.860
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.911
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:41.952 --> 27:44.121
You want a juice?
I could get you one.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.247
I'm okay.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.001
You could try mine.
It's apple.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.878
No, thanks.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.426
You could try the clothes,
you know.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.846
I could help you.
With your makeup and all.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.015
I mean, if you want to.

28:03.057 --> 28:06.143
-There's no rush.
-You know the girl who broke in?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.978
The one I left with?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.147
In Romania.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.233
What about her?

28:12.274 --> 28:14.026
She's dead.

28:16.070 --> 28:19.657
Oh. I'm sorry.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.867
We were in the forest together.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.078
But then I left.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.414
Why did you leave?

28:26.455 --> 28:27.915
I thought I could find
my mother.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.042
But they guessed
that I'd look for her

28:30.084 --> 28:32.211
and they tricked me.

28:32.253 --> 28:35.673
Actually, I was trying
to work out how they knew...

28:35.714 --> 28:39.051
that I discovered
about my mother.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.595
I figure someone
must have told them.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.598
Oh, yeah?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.767
Yeah.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.602
Someone must have seen me

28:48.644 --> 28:51.397
looking at my mother's name
on the computer system that day.

28:51.439 --> 28:52.773
And then told on me.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.694
And then I realized

28:56.735 --> 28:59.196
that your door
was the only one open.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.449
Because I opened it.

29:03.617 --> 29:07.538
Did you help them find me...
242?

29:07.580 --> 29:10.040
My name's not 242, it's Sandy.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.418
-Did you help them?
-Course not.

29:17.131 --> 29:20.217
I didn't mean to.
They asked me questions.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.928
-And you answered the questions?
-What was I supposed to do?

29:22.970 --> 29:25.097
They said they could bring you
back here and make you safe.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.766
And you decided that
that is what I wanted?

29:27.808 --> 29:30.060
I just wanted to help.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.563
I mean, look around here.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.315
It's beautiful.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.987
You think you know
what's best for me? 242?

29:40.029 --> 29:42.239
My name is not 242.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.992
-You think you know?
-Get the hell off me.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.046
with a bikini in Bequia

29:57.087 --> 30:00.257
Galliano sack me

30:00.299 --> 30:03.177
like your freaking acne

30:03.219 --> 30:05.971
brand new perspective

30:06.013 --> 30:09.767
with matching red lipstick

30:09.808 --> 30:11.977
I got front

30:12.019 --> 30:15.773
I got a trunk

30:15.814 --> 30:17.858
throw it in the bank bank

30:17.900 --> 30:20.986
but this ain't what you think

30:26.408 --> 30:27.618
-

30:31.288 --> 30:33.123
-

31:01.986 --> 31:03.028
It's me.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.283
Hanna?

31:10.286 --> 31:12.288
Hanna?

31:19.128 --> 31:20.588
Fuck.

32:50.094 --> 32:53.305
:
Welcome, trialists,
to the Passway facility.

32:53.347 --> 32:56.517
Please proceed to Area C
for trial induction.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.339
Lucy?
Lucy Wiegler.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.969
Uh, you're not on the list.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.305
Did you apply for this trial?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.141
I think so.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.017
Do you have your consent form?

33:46.608 --> 33:49.069
Welcome, trialists,
to the Passway facility.

33:49.111 --> 33:51.989
Please proceed to Area C
for trial induction.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.584
Excuse me.
Are you doing the trial?

34:03.625 --> 34:05.753
Maybe.

34:05.794 --> 34:08.505
If I give you this money,
will you let me take your place?

34:08.547 --> 34:09.965
-Please?
-No, thanks.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.633
I'm getting five times that.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.595
Give me your bag.
And your jacket.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.638
Take off your hoodie.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.148
Go home,
and don't ever come back.

34:34.865 --> 34:36.700
Monica Gastner.

34:46.919 --> 34:49.254
-Does that hurt?

34:49.296 --> 34:51.381
A little.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.009
-She's crazy.
-They should put her down.

34:54.051 --> 34:56.762
-Don't say that.
-What? It's true.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.764
She just causes trouble.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.057
Thanks.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
For helping me.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.312
No sweat.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.650
What?

35:09.691 --> 35:11.068
It's just a funny phrase.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.070
What is?

35:13.111 --> 35:16.281
"No sweat."
Kind of 1950s.

35:16.323 --> 35:17.616
Ow!

35:21.578 --> 35:23.622
Be more careful next time.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.430
WOMAN:
Do you have everything
you need for your stay?

35:40.472 --> 35:43.559
As you know, this is
a three-night trial.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.686
The first night,
you will be given the drug,

35:45.727 --> 35:48.188
and in some cases a placebo.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.107
And you will be placed
under observation.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.693
The second night
you will receive nothing,

35:52.734 --> 35:55.779
and you will be free
to hang out, play games,

35:55.821 --> 35:56.905
get to know each other.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.825
The third night,

35:59.867 --> 36:02.578
you will receive
another treatment.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.746
At all times,
you will be observed,

36:04.788 --> 36:06.164
and we want you to know

36:06.206 --> 36:10.002
that your safety
is our paramount concern.

36:41.158 --> 36:43.160
This way.

36:50.334 --> 36:53.545
-Please swallow this.
-What is it?

36:53.587 --> 36:55.589
It's just a small relaxant.
Nothing to worry about.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.679
I don't want to.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.723
Then you'll have to leave.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.819
Okay, good.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.655
We'll call you soon.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.824
No eating from now on.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.494
Are there any other people
staying here?

37:25.535 --> 37:27.913
-People?
-Young women, staying here?

37:27.955 --> 37:29.915
This is just a trial center.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.959
Only trialists stay here.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.142
-MALE NURSE: Okay.
-

37:49.184 --> 37:51.144
How we doing?

37:57.109 --> 37:59.736
Take your arm
out of your sweater.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.827
Hold it like this.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.675
Leave your belongings here,
come with me.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.559
HANNA:
I'm looking for a girl.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.561
Her name's Clara.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.731
MALE NURSE:
I don't know her.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.941
I need to find her.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.568
MALE NURSE:
I told you, I don't know her.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.153
This way.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.061
Take a seat.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.778
What is that?

39:22.819 --> 39:24.738
Just a screen.

39:24.780 --> 39:28.116
You'll be observed at all times
for your own safety.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.952
Okay, we'll fix you up
to this line.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.996
You'll feel a small pinch.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.925
Who are these drugs for?

39:44.966 --> 39:46.343
Now the music will play.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.136
Just watch the image.

39:48.178 --> 39:52.307
Sit back, relax, but try
to keep your eyes open, okay?

39:52.349 --> 39:55.310
If you need assistance,
you press this emergency button.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.354
-You understand?
-

40:25.757 --> 40:29.177
MAN:
Please raise your hand
to indicate you're okay.

40:32.556 --> 40:34.141
Okay, that's good.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.227
Just look at the trees.

40:53.660 --> 40:57.622
LEO:
I think we underestimated
the problems she's experiencing.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.457
CARMICHAEL:
I don't get it.

40:59.499 --> 41:02.460
30 trainees, happy, smiling,

41:02.502 --> 41:05.463
following absolutely
every predicted pathway.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.299
And this one.

41:07.340 --> 41:10.510
-LEO: Mind of her own.
-Don't be flippant.

41:10.552 --> 41:14.347
Any flaw to the program this
early does none of us any good.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.391
-So what do you suggest?
-

41:16.433 --> 41:18.977
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize...

41:19.019 --> 41:21.438
I just came to see how she was.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.981
LEO:
Terri, this is John Carmichael.

41:23.023 --> 41:24.608
We've met.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.485
You think you can tell me
why she's failing?

41:27.527 --> 41:30.113
Oh, I-I don't know.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.908
My hunch is that
she feels different,

41:32.949 --> 41:35.827
on some fundamental level.

41:35.869 --> 41:37.454
Well, maybe you should
work with her,

41:37.495 --> 41:39.289
-see if you can
make some progress.
-Sure.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.499
Because if this fails,
I have to cut her loose.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.543
There's a personal
and financial cost to that.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.795
One I'd like to avoid.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.567
MAN:
If your reactions are
significant in the test cases,

42:07.609 --> 42:10.570
then we can explore effects
also on the Utrax recipients.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.948
-WOMAN: Agreed.
-MAN: We anticipate
more extreme reactions

42:12.989 --> 42:16.409
in those cases and can vary
dosage accordingly.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.996
WOMAN:
What's the final
operational remit?

42:20.038 --> 42:21.957
MAN:
Removal of all inhibitions
towards the achievement

42:21.998 --> 42:23.750
of maximum violence.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.585
To be used
in extreme situations only.

42:25.627 --> 42:27.003
WOMAN:
Of course.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.967
ERIK:
And human beings are?

42:32.008 --> 42:33.510
HANNA:
Dangerous and not
to be trusted.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.970
ERIK:
If you see one?

42:35.011 --> 42:36.972
HANNA:
Come and find you.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.599
-ERIK: If there's no time?
-Hide.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.060
-HANNA: If I can't hide...
-

42:42.102 --> 42:43.853
...attack.

43:03.206 --> 43:05.625
MAN:
What the hell are you doing?!

43:11.214 --> 43:14.175
Let me out of here!

43:14.217 --> 43:16.594
Please let me out!

43:25.270 --> 43:26.646
-Stay back. No, no, no-- No!
-Stay calm.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.084
Where is the Meadows?

45:11.126 --> 45:13.503
Who are you?

45:13.545 --> 45:15.505
Tell me where they are.

45:34.858 --> 45:36.860
Get in.

45:45.994 --> 45:48.538
Hi.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.373
Can I come in?

45:50.415 --> 45:52.417
You're already here.

45:54.127 --> 45:55.962
What do you want?

45:57.005 --> 45:59.007
I work here.

46:00.425 --> 46:01.843
Can I sit down?
