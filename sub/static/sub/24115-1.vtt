00:03.280 --> 00:04.280
<i>Kal-El.</i>

00:05.680 --> 00:07.433
<i>My future grandson.</i>

00:08.039 --> 00:10.794
<i>This is the story
of the House of El.</i>

00:13.000 --> 00:15.276
<i>Our ending has yet
to be written.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:19.640
<i>But this is how we began.</i>

00:21.160 --> 00:24.039
<i>Ours is a story of sacrifice</i>

00:24.200 --> 00:25.475
<i>and triumph.</i>

00:26.400 --> 00:28.232
<i>How the House of El</i>

00:28.400 --> 00:31.040
<i>led a revolution
against tyranny.</i>

00:32.040 --> 00:35.875
<i>The story of your family
isn't how we died.</i>

00:37.040 --> 00:39.271
<i>But how we lived.</i>

00:59.920 --> 01:02.151
<i>Two hundred years
before your birth,</i>

01:02.320 --> 01:04.152
<i>the House of El almost ended.</i>

01:05.319 --> 01:08.119
<i>And I was almost
the last of our line.</i>

01:12.120 --> 01:13.440
<i>It began the day
my grandfather</i>

01:13.600 --> 01:15.557
<i>was tried for treason.</i>

01:16.720 --> 01:18.200
<i>That day saw the rise</i>

01:18.360 --> 01:20.716
<i>of a terrible new power
in Krypton.</i>

01:21.320 --> 01:25.030
<i>An end to all
we had previously known.</i>

01:26.160 --> 01:27.833
Val of House El.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.156
I offer you a final chance

01:31.360 --> 01:34.194
to pledge your loyalty
to His Eminence,

01:34.400 --> 01:36.357
the Voice of Rao.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.799
Don't hold your breath.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.280
Listen to me.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.040
The old Council is no more.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.510
They've already sworn
their allegiance.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.430
All but you.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.150
You're our greatest
scientific mind, Val.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.559
Think of all you've
accomplished.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.479
Are you willing
to throw it all away?

01:57.640 --> 02:00.109
I've taken measures
to safeguard my work.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.634
I had to.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.917
You can deny it all you like.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.514
But the truth is,

02:05.880 --> 02:08.315
we are not alone
in the universe.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.071
Krypton is vulnerable.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.951
And praying to him won't be
enough to save it.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.559
Val of House El.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.519
For rebelling against the
lawful authority of the state,

02:26.680 --> 02:29.991
you leave me no choice but
to find you guilty of sedition.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.195
You are hereby
sentenced to death.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.758
The name El will be struck from
the Registry of Citizens.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.277
Your family will be stripped
of all rights and privileges.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.955
You are now to be
considered Rankless.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.794
Without guild.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.880
Without name.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.354
Without honor.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.150
You chose the wrong side.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.476
Remember, Seg.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.431
Keep believing
in a better tomorrow.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.194
Grandpa!

03:53.320 --> 03:54.800
I love you!

04:16.120 --> 04:18.635
No!
No!

04:19.399 --> 04:20.516
Grandpa!

04:21.279 --> 04:22.555
Grandpa!

04:25.200 --> 04:26.793
Shh.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.913
Where's the money, Seg?

04:54.320 --> 04:57.233
Fifty thousand Solars.
Remember?

05:00.320 --> 05:02.357
What're you waiting for?

05:04.120 --> 05:05.793
I vaguely recall 30.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.677
Come on now.
Up you go.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.759
Thank you.
Thanks.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.680
All right.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
50 it is.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.796
Only 'cause you seem
like nice guys.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
Why so surprised?

05:29.080 --> 05:30.833
- Didn't think we'd find you?
- Honestly?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.856
You look like you'd have
trouble finding your own ass

05:32.880 --> 05:34.256
with both hands
tied behind your back.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.158
And my guess is you're
the smart one.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.790
Oh, that was fair.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.520
And I deserved that.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.594
So I should apologize.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.199
Please tell your wife
and your sister

05:54.360 --> 05:55.760
I'm gonna be late tonight.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.435
If that's the best you got...

06:12.840 --> 06:14.718
maybe I won't be
as late as I thought.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.470
Always got something clever
to say, haven't you?

06:17.640 --> 06:20.553
Well, if you're so clever,
tell me this.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.155
How come you're on the stupid
end of this blaster?

06:25.240 --> 06:26.240
Easy, mate.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.519
My stupid end's bigger.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.114
Seg, you'd better pay them now.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.113
Just pay them.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.760
Ah, easy.
Easy.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.920
Bye-bye, now.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
Bye.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.314
Yeah, all right.
Calm down, calm down.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.837
For all you degenerate gamblers
who bet our boy

06:59.000 --> 07:02.311
could last more
than one minute and 37 seconds,

07:02.520 --> 07:03.840
a hearty congratulations.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.593
The rest of you, pay up.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.911
Come on, it's pay day.
Let's go.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.518
One minute, 37 seconds.
That was impressive.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
Mmm.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.154
That didn't go through.
Come on.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.880
Could you remind me why
I'm the one who has to go

07:57.040 --> 07:58.315
and provoke the very large,

07:58.480 --> 08:00.233
very corrupt
government officials?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.736
I guess that's just the way
that this one goes, isn't it?

08:02.760 --> 08:03.955
- Mmm-hmm.
- Plus you've got

08:04.120 --> 08:07.238
superior stamina and,
uh, a very punchable face.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.040
Mmm, well, yours
is looking more punchable

08:09.080 --> 08:10.833
- by the minute, mate.
- Wow.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.116
How'd we do?

08:13.520 --> 08:16.877
Uh, 218 minus 50 for damages.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.235
Yeah, not a bad night's work.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.073
And good clean fun.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.391
Maybe it's good clean
fun for you.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.959
Yeah, I think I'm gonna bounce,
mate.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.639
Uh, can I use
the, uh, back way?

08:28.880 --> 08:30.758
- Uh, any particular reason?
- Nope.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.496
Other than the friendly
government officials

08:32.520 --> 08:33.715
that just went out front.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.037
Free drinks for the next hour!

08:38.559 --> 08:39.357
Sorry, mate.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.775
It's just the way
this one works, I guess.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.313
But Seg...
Hey, Seg...

08:42.480 --> 08:43.708
No, Seg, you can't leave.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.111
This is com... this is coming
out of your share!

09:13.440 --> 09:14.440
Seg, where've you been?

09:14.800 --> 09:15.800
Hi, dad.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.519
Whoa, hey, wait.
What happened?

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
You okay?

09:18.760 --> 09:19.511
Yeah, had a great night.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.000
Look, 150 in profit.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.955
Pretty good, right?

09:23.360 --> 09:24.400
Please tell me you and Kem

09:24.560 --> 09:26.392
didn't pull that scam again
last night.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.035
All right, fine.
I won't.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.592
If you keep carrying
on like this,

09:30.760 --> 09:32.536
Dad, we can talk about this
in the morning, please.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.358
It is morning, Seg.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.595
You can't keep doing this.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.336
If you're caught after curfew...

09:39.360 --> 09:41.096
They'll put me in the lunar
work camps, I know, I know.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
Look, we need that money.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.600
Well, I can take extra shifts.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.591
- At the Guild?
- Yeah.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.876
Great.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.633
The same people
who executed Grandpa.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.995
Forced us to live down here.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.395
Sounds like a plan.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.709
Well, I should get going.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.718
- Seg...
- I know.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.560
I'm sorry.
It was stupid.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.239
- Does that hurt?
- Mmm.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.914
Yeah, a lot.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.434
Good, maybe it'll remind you

10:18.600 --> 10:20.478
to start using
that brain of yours.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.434
There's always a chance.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.912
Oh, your dad's
forgotten his meds.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.675
Mom, don't worry.
I'll get them.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.752
- Don't worry.
- No, you're still drunk.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.274
That's how I do my best work.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.080
You look terrible,
and you smell even worse.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.796
Fine,
I'll get cleaned up first.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.336
Wouldn't want to put more shame
on the family, would I?

11:40.800 --> 11:44.316
Do not mistake passion
for strength.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.677
The ability to divorce oneself
of emotion during battle

11:48.840 --> 11:52.197
is what separates the living
from the dead.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.151
Sagittari Zod.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.999
Weapons or hand-to-hand?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.511
Dev-Em, choose
for your intended.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.913
Hand-to-hand.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.714
Ask for mercy.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.839
No.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.469
Ask for mercy!

12:49.640 --> 12:50.676
No!

12:55.520 --> 12:56.636
Mercy!

12:57.720 --> 12:59.279
Black Zero!

12:59.440 --> 13:01.477
Beasts of the Outlands.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.474
Factions within
other city-states.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.951
All of them seek
to annihilate us.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.518
We are Sagittari.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.111
The tip of the spear
that guards this city.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.558
We never ask for mercy.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.392
And we never give it!

13:22.960 --> 13:25.759
Do you understand,
Lyta-Zod?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.434
Yes, Mother.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.597
You call yourselves
freedom fighters,

13:39.760 --> 13:43.117
but you wage war on the people
of Kandor City.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.839
You claim to fight
for equality,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.390
but bring only bloodshed
and chaos.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.512
That ends today.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.758
You have all been found guilty
of high treason

13:53.120 --> 13:54.554
for aiding and abetting

13:54.720 --> 13:57.394
the terrorist organization
Black Zero.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.637
- Seg, we should not be here.
- I know,

13:59.800 --> 14:01.376
but he needs the optics,
and he's in chambers.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.197
- What do you want me to do?
- Just hurry up.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.437
Hey, there's no Rankless
in this sector.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.317
No, I understand.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.616
I just need to pass something
onto my father.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.640
- Leave now or be arrested.
- Okay, we are leaving.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.296
Excellent job manning
your post, by the way.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.640
Your Reverence.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.677
If you would give the condemned
their final benediction.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.360
He's got a bomb!

14:22.680 --> 14:24.797
Death to the Voice of Rao!

14:28.000 --> 14:29.957
- Seg!
- Behind me, Your Magistrate!

14:33.160 --> 14:33.991
Damn filth!

14:45.840 --> 14:48.400
You did a brave thing, Seg.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.439
We are in your debt.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.954
You hate me.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.316
I took the life
of a man you loved,

15:05.480 --> 15:07.278
took your family's rank,

15:08.120 --> 15:09.839
erased its future...

15:11.240 --> 15:13.357
Before it could
even be written.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.592
You turn 23 soon, don't you?

15:23.440 --> 15:24.840
If you were Ranked,

15:25.240 --> 15:26.720
you'd become a Guildsman.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.590
Perhaps even granted permission
to Bind with someone.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.077
But I'm not Ranked, sir.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.795
Not yet.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.035
Under certain circumstances,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.112
the Council can re-instate
family Rank.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.391
What?

15:42.560 --> 15:45.075
I have conferred
with a genetic council.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.200
They have deemed
you best suited

15:47.360 --> 15:49.158
to join the Science Guild.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.758
You are to be assigned
a new surname.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.275
My name.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.954
Vex.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.874
Nyssa here has yet
to be paired with someone.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.679
As my youngest daughter,
you'll be Binding with her.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.477
He's a wonderful choice,
father.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.115
Welcome to the family, Seg.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.272
Well, that's not how
I thought today would go.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.954
- Really?
- No, I was pretty sure

16:24.120 --> 16:26.096
that you'd get a Guild rank
and a wife before lunch.

16:26.120 --> 16:26.951
Don't forget foiling
a terrorist,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.120
'cause I did that, too.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.560
We, yes, we did do that.

16:29.720 --> 16:30.551
But you know what?

16:30.720 --> 16:32.136
I'm gonna let you take
the credit on that one.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.296
It's not like
I wanna be a Vex.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.549
What's not to want?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.399
You've got better food,
better air,

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
better ice.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.856
You're gonna be
one of them again.

16:38.880 --> 16:39.880
But not as an El.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.576
And you've as much of a right
to be Ranked as me.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.034
Oh, shut up, Seg.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.637
Look, once you get Vexxed up,

16:45.800 --> 16:49.077
if I ever, ever see you
down here again,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.796
I'm gonna shred you myself.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.712
On your knees!

16:56.040 --> 16:57.554
Why's he down here?

16:59.160 --> 17:00.480
Clear the sector, citizen.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.599
I said move along.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.760
- Leave it, Seg.
- Hey!

17:04.839 --> 17:05.839
Seg!

17:05.960 --> 17:07.440
- Seg, just leave it.
- Hey!

17:07.680 --> 17:09.455
He worked the Outlands
for more than 50 cycles.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.755
His mind's not right anymore.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.395
Clear the sector, Rankless.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.040
You and the burnout.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.800
You wanna explain this,
Saj-Atara?

17:25.960 --> 17:29.112
I was clearing the sector
of potential threat

17:29.280 --> 17:30.656
when this piece of shit
attacked me.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.000
Threat?
He's an old man.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.536
- Now, now, just a simple...
- Get back!

17:33.560 --> 17:35.040
- Understanding.
- I've got this, Dev.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.077
Face down, Rankless.
Hands behind your back.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.838
I'll book him.
You handle the other moron.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.160
What the hell
were you thinking, Seg?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.039
Are you gonna uncuff me
or what?

17:56.920 --> 17:58.195
I like you this way.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.156
The whole city's on alert,

18:04.320 --> 18:06.710
and you mix it up with
a Voice security detail.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.917
More like an out of control
goon squad.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.656
What happened to your people
having some discipline?

18:10.680 --> 18:13.070
They were handpicked
by the Voice himself,

18:13.240 --> 18:14.720
chosen for their devotion.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.236
Great, people are crazy
on both sides now.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.754
Turn around.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.752
What's that supposed to mean?

18:20.920 --> 18:23.594
Um...
I'll tell you later.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.836
What happened to your hand?

18:26.040 --> 18:28.271
Mother and I spent
some quality time

18:28.440 --> 18:29.635
in the training room.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.916
Tomorrow night.
Don't be late.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.675
Don't even think about it.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.715
Okay, I don't wanna fight.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.800
Who are you?
And what are you wearing?

18:59.960 --> 19:01.240
Is that a guild?
Is that a guild?

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
No, it's not a guild.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.880
This is the Detroit Tigers,
man.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.430
Just... Would you just shut up
and listen to me?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.176
Okay, I've traveled across
a lot of time and space

19:08.200 --> 19:09.634
to come find you.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.196
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound, um...

19:12.360 --> 19:14.238
Uh...
Completely insane.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.312
But, um, please,
just go with it.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.995
Yeah?
Okay.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.231
My name is Adam Strange, and...

19:22.160 --> 19:23.435
Will you just let me finish?

19:23.640 --> 19:24.994
I come from a planet
called Earth.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.480
A time centuries from now.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.319
And I've come here to warn you.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.796
Someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.158
- Okay, right.
- Whoa!

19:33.320 --> 19:34.834
Why?
Why would they do that?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Because where I'm from,

19:36.080 --> 19:38.754
your grandson becomes the
greatest hero in the universe.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.990
Like, ever.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.376
Unless somebody changes things
to make sure

19:42.400 --> 19:44.790
that he's never born...

19:46.360 --> 19:47.476
You all right?

19:47.760 --> 19:48.955
I'm running out of time.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.836
Take this.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.232
You have to find the fortress.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.270
You have to save Superman.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.514
Where did...

20:17.800 --> 20:18.517
Well, it's a...

20:18.680 --> 20:19.431
it's a variation,

20:19.600 --> 20:22.798
but it's definitely
our family glyph all right.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.319
What exactly did
this Strange guy say again?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.639
Something about
my future grandson.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.200
Another planet.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.552
Detroit, I think he called it.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.116
And...

20:36.200 --> 20:37.634
Something about a fortress.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.714
Well, I shall take care
of this for you.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.040
Why?

20:49.680 --> 20:50.800
What's the big deal with it?

20:51.120 --> 20:52.240
Well, the symbol,
it's, uh...

20:52.400 --> 20:54.198
It's outlawed.
You know that.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.834
It's much too dangerous
for you to be carrying around.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.957
Especially now that you're
going to be Ranked.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.400
You mean we.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.189
We're about to be Ranked.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.680
No, son,
this is not how it works.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.354
No, the offer is for you only.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.113
We... We won't be joining you.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.416
You think I'm gonna
go live up there

21:13.440 --> 21:14.669
and leave you down here?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.752
I... I'm sorry,
that's not happening.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.317
Seg, this is a chance
at a new life.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.360
Come on,
you should probably go.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.432
You're due in the
Genesis Chamber soon.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.150
Fine.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.791
All right, but we're not
done discussing this.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.956
Love you.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.550
Bye.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.080
We have to tell him.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.270
No, he's not ready.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.594
If Val was right,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.310
it doesn't matter
if he's ready or not.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.992
Strange to think our
ancestors used to carry

22:28.200 --> 22:29.919
children in their wombs.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.999
Just seems so inefficient.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.074
After you.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.797
<i>The Oracle foresees
the product of your union.</i>

22:51.360 --> 22:53.352
<i>The child will be male.</i>

22:54.160 --> 22:57.597
<i>His name: Cor-Vex</i>

22:58.480 --> 23:01.393
<i>He will be of sound health
and good character.</i>

23:02.440 --> 23:04.557
<i>Bio-scans designate
he will be best suited</i>

23:04.720 --> 23:06.200
<i>for the Lawmakers Guild.</i>

23:06.400 --> 23:08.960
<i>He will live 173 cycles</i>

23:09.120 --> 23:11.589
<i>in noble servitude
to His Reverence.</i>

23:14.720 --> 23:16.916
Such a rush
of maternal warmth.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.272
Cor-Vex.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.755
He seemed handsome enough.
There's that at least.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.554
Doesn't it bother you?

23:27.240 --> 23:30.119
Knowing exactly how his life's
gonna play out?

23:31.720 --> 23:33.712
I'm the fifth
of five daughters, Seg.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.296
It's a miracle the Council
are allowing me

23:35.320 --> 23:36.549
to bind with anyone.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.874
I'll take what I can get.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.430
Even a Rankless boy
with a chip on his shoulder.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.831
Your father chooses me,
and you accept without a word.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.593
Please tell me you
aren't that naive.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.836
You are the grandson
of a traitor.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.078
If my father binds you to us,
he is taming you.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.676
Proving that even a dreaded El
can be co-opted

23:55.840 --> 23:57.957
- and brought into the fold.
- I'm just a game piece.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.755
Everyone in Kandor
is a game piece to my father.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.593
Including me.

24:06.680 --> 24:10.390
Besides, you're not
completely repellent.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.954
There's a lot I could teach
you about life up here.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.876
My father only thinks

24:20.040 --> 24:22.077
he was the one
who chose you.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.400
So, what's she like?

24:32.560 --> 24:34.074
Nyssa-Vex.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.680
She's interesting.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.560
She's funnier than you'd think,
once she loosens up.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.153
I'm happy for you.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.589
Council's scheduled
my Binding to Dev.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.799
Two weeks from now.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.680
Before the Council
controlled everything,

24:55.840 --> 24:57.194
the binding ritual
was a choice.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.916
Shut up.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.593
I just want this.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.314
You.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.800
Right now.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.354
<i>Curfew is in effect.</i>

25:35.800 --> 25:37.792
Oi, Rankless!

25:37.960 --> 25:39.296
What are you doing out
after curfew?

25:39.320 --> 25:40.834
Uh, hey, guys.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.070
Look, I was working late.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.435
Um, I lost track of time.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.736
I'm headed home right now, so...

25:44.760 --> 25:46.194
We're on a terror alert.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.600
You lose track of that, too?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.234
Uh, mate, look,
it's not a big deal.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.520
- Against the wall.
- Can we just... Do we have to...

25:54.600 --> 25:56.239
What's this?

26:19.760 --> 26:20.830
Where is he?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.194
He's not down here!

26:24.680 --> 26:26.831
He must have gone
the other way!

26:33.760 --> 26:36.070
- Seg, get in!
- Mom?

26:36.280 --> 26:37.760
Come on, let's go!
Get in!

27:03.440 --> 27:05.671
Mom, what's going on?

27:05.960 --> 27:07.030
Don't start.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.396
You're playing a dangerous game
with Lyta-Zod.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.114
If her mother finds out...

27:11.480 --> 27:12.675
You've been following me.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.309
You were told to leave
that Sunstone behind.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.392
You do know what this is.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.394
Yes.
And I'm sorry.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.153
That's why I'm here.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.640
It's time you learned
the truth.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.360
And you had to steal
a skimmer for that?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.519
I prefer borrowed.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.592
We need it to get
where we're going.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.160
Welcome to your grandfather's
Fortress of Solitude.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.110
Go on.
Try it.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.116
He was right.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.280
The guy who gave me
the Sunstone.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.798
Adam, he...
This place is real.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.355
I don't know how he knew
about it, but...

29:25.880 --> 29:28.031
Yes, it's real all right.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.715
Why'd you never tell me
about this place before?

29:34.440 --> 29:35.954
To protect you.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.434
If your father had his way,
you still wouldn't know.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.760
But I figured it was time
you learned the truth.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.240
This fortress.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.472
It's why they killed
grandfather, isn't it?

29:53.200 --> 29:54.395
Val was determined to prove

29:54.600 --> 29:56.876
we weren't alone
in the universe.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.554
After the council
shut down his work,

29:58.720 --> 30:00.712
he would come here
to continue in secret.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.116
He found something
he wasn't supposed to.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.794
Some kind of alien presence

30:08.960 --> 30:10.633
he believed
was consuming other worlds

30:10.800 --> 30:12.951
and would someday
come for Krypton.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.994
He tried to warn the Council,
and they silenced him for it.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.840
Your father and I believed him.
There was nothing we could do.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.434
With Val dead,
we didn't even know

30:21.600 --> 30:22.954
how to get into this place.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.472
Your grandfather
was no traitor.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.160
He was a hero.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.552
He was trying
to protect Krypton.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.038
He believed in it so much,
he was willing to die for it.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.392
We have to finish his work.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.189
Together.

30:41.320 --> 30:42.913
Military scout ships.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.296
They must have tracked
the skimmer.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.800
Come on, let's go.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.393
I wiped the skimmer's nav-data

30:59.560 --> 31:01.576
so at least they won't be able
to find the Fortress.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.716
True, but sooner or later,

31:02.920 --> 31:04.360
they're gonna figure out
who took it.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.272
Looks like sooner.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.558
Seg, we've gotta go.
Come on, quick.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.350
You can't let the Sunstone
fall into the wrong hands.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.816
- Surround it! Around the back!
- Keep it safe.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.035
Mom, I'm not leaving you.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.714
You'll need it
to finish Val's work.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.633
That's all that matters now.

31:22.800 --> 31:23.950
Do you hear?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.634
Now, go.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.910
Now you.
Get in.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.594
- Mom.
- I'm not coming.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.194
- Surround it!
- Mom, stop.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.476
No, Mom!

31:38.320 --> 31:39.117
You are under arrest.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.480
- Let's go!
- Clear that corner.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.016
Keep your hands where
I can see them.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.399
Take the entire place apart.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.712
A skimmer was
stolen last night.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.873
Your son was seen
within the same proximity.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.793
We need to speak with him.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.633
If he ever comes home again,

31:57.800 --> 31:59.996
I'll be sure to tell him
you stopped by.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.760
You understand we don't need
to take you in alive.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
Right?

32:06.520 --> 32:08.477
Tell me where he is.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.035
You're wasting your time.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.353
My son didn't steal
the skimmer.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.000
I did.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.113
- I serve Black Zero.
- Take her!

32:29.960 --> 32:31.474
Seg, you shouldn't be here.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.840
Let's just tell
them the truth

32:32.880 --> 32:33.960
and give them the Sunstone.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.355
Maybe they'll spare you.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.956
This is bigger than me.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.033
This is about
our entire civilization.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.835
Get him out.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.997
He was never here.
Understood?

33:10.480 --> 33:14.554
Tell me he played no part
in this treachery.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.958
You know our children love
each other, don't you?

33:18.440 --> 33:19.760
That's why you're
protecting him.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.593
I will not allow
my daughter's life

33:21.760 --> 33:24.514
to be ruined
by your son's mistakes.

33:25.640 --> 33:30.032
Death is not the only thing the
Council can threaten you with.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.560
And certainly not the worst.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.638
I know what they can do.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.554
Then tell them everything you
know about Black Zero.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.274
Seg will live.

33:40.760 --> 33:43.753
And I promise you a good death.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.557
Like the one they gave Val?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.679
Primus Zod,

33:59.840 --> 34:02.833
the accused claims
she acted alone.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.113
Would you enlighten us?

34:05.520 --> 34:07.193
Our scanners clearly
registered

34:07.360 --> 34:10.194
two bio-signatures
in the stolen skimmer.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.600
Your scanners are wrong.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.234
Yet upon your capture,

34:16.400 --> 34:18.835
you claimed allegiance
to Black Zero.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.231
I told them what
they wanted to hear.

34:21.639 --> 34:24.313
To get in front of
the people of Kandor.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.399
To tell them the truth.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.359
We are not alone!
Don't believe their lies!

34:29.520 --> 34:32.239
- Val-El was right!
- Enough!

34:32.719 --> 34:35.554
The only one who lies here
today is you.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.992
14 cycles ago,
we condemned your father-in-law

34:39.159 --> 34:40.560
to the ice.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.639
And now you maintain
his claims!

34:44.560 --> 34:46.233
Tell the truth.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.915
You stole that skimmer
in an effort to locate

34:49.080 --> 34:51.594
Val-El's hidden fortress.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.268
Did you not?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.557
Did you not?

34:58.920 --> 34:59.956
Hmm.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.913
Well, did you find it?

35:03.920 --> 35:06.037
Who was with you
in that skimmer?

35:06.280 --> 35:08.476
Who was your accomplice,
Charys?

35:09.080 --> 35:10.196
Dad.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.192
Tell me the truth!

35:12.360 --> 35:14.016
- I have to stop this.
- No, son, you cannot...

35:14.040 --> 35:15.872
- I have to stop this.
- You cannot do this.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.997
The punishment
for high treason

35:18.160 --> 35:22.632
is unequivocal for the sake of
your husband and for your son.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.280
I love you.
It was me!

35:24.440 --> 35:25.440
No, Ter!

35:25.640 --> 35:27.711
I was Charys' accomplice!

35:29.240 --> 35:30.754
Take him!

35:33.960 --> 35:35.360
Dad!

35:35.640 --> 35:36.915
No!

35:48.480 --> 35:49.480
No.
Please, no.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.630
Please, no!
Please!

35:50.800 --> 35:52.314
Mother, no!

36:04.440 --> 36:05.840
I don't care what it takes.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.912
- Find it.
- If this fortress does exist,

36:08.080 --> 36:09.136
what makes it so important?

36:09.160 --> 36:11.038
Weapons, technology.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.600
I will not allow
Val-El's legacy

36:12.760 --> 36:14.200
to fall into the hands
of Black Zero.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.312
Black Zero?
Please.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.756
Ter was covering
for his son.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.639
Charys confessed
for the same reason.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.176
We could have questioned
them further

36:23.200 --> 36:24.680
if they'd been taken alive.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
I upheld the law.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.434
There were other options.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.876
But like a blunt instrument,

36:30.080 --> 36:31.799
you chose to terminate
them both.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.434
If I didn't know you better,
Jayna,

36:33.600 --> 36:35.796
I'd think it was
an act of mercy.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.416
They knew exactly
what you'd do to them

36:37.440 --> 36:38.715
if they surrendered.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.077
Or did you forget
the resolve of House El?

36:41.240 --> 36:42.515
You should have considered that

36:42.720 --> 36:45.235
before offering him
to your daughter.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.472
You gave Seg a Rank
in the Science Guild.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.752
And you believe you
can control him?

36:52.640 --> 36:57.396
I'm just a blunt instrument,
Daron...

36:58.160 --> 37:00.197
But I'd rethink it.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.320
Your Reverence.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.993
I didn't see you there.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.800
I'm so sorry.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.437
If I could undo
what my mother did...

38:22.320 --> 38:24.596
She killed my parents, Lyta.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.554
They were all I had.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.717
You still got me, Seg.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.113
Well, you said it yourself.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.560
This had to end.

38:43.440 --> 38:46.080
We were never gonna find a way
to be together.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.274
Especially now.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.594
Where are you going?

39:01.680 --> 39:03.558
- Thank you.
- No worries.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.920
Where have you been?
I didn't know...

39:11.000 --> 39:13.390
Kem, I have to get
out of here, mate.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.916
I need to be alone.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.430
Can you help me?

39:18.320 --> 39:19.436
What do you need?

39:36.400 --> 39:37.800
Thank God, it worked.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.513
Sunstone opened this place up.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
What are you doing here?

39:42.160 --> 39:43.389
Well, I was looking for you.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.016
Wasn't sure if you found this
place or not, but...

39:47.200 --> 39:48.520
You got my parents killed.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.637
What are you talking about?

39:50.920 --> 39:52.115
You gave me that Sunstone.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.596
You told me to find this place,
and I did.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.114
And now my parents are dead!

39:56.280 --> 39:57.953
They died to protect me!

40:02.160 --> 40:04.470
They died to protect
whatever all of this is.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.353
And it doesn't matter.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.640
Does it?

40:10.560 --> 40:12.791
If you really believe that,

40:12.960 --> 40:14.440
then why are you here?

40:15.320 --> 40:16.436
Huh?

40:23.600 --> 40:25.557
I don't know why I'm here.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.360
I thought that maybe if I could
finish my grandfather's work

40:28.440 --> 40:31.797
then maybe my parents
didn't die for nothing.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.915
But what I do know for sure
is that because of you...

40:39.440 --> 40:41.397
My entire family's gone.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.555
You only think that you're
the end of the line.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.235
This belongs to your grandson.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.400
Kal-El.

40:59.240 --> 41:02.039
Emphasis on the El.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.920
Why's it doing that?

41:10.080 --> 41:11.594
It's like an hourglass.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.911
Once this cape is gone,
our time's up.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.160
And Superman will have been
wiped from existence.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.080
This isn't just about
your grandson, Seg.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.953
This thing that's coming.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.670
It's not just gonna
stop at Krypton.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.792
It is coming for everything.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.794
What are you talking about?

41:37.760 --> 41:39.114
It moves...

41:39.680 --> 41:41.080
from planet to planet

41:42.440 --> 41:45.080
<i>conquering civilizations.</i>

41:47.160 --> 41:49.391
<i>Destroying billions of lives.</i>

41:51.040 --> 41:53.999
<i>It's known as the
Collector of Worlds.</i>

41:55.640 --> 41:57.393
<i>But it's true name...</i>

41:59.960 --> 42:01.394
<i>Is Brainiac.</i>

42:03.960 --> 42:05.633
Now, I'm sorry about
your folks, Seg.

42:05.800 --> 42:06.800
I really am.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.392
And it seems your parents
gave their lives

42:09.600 --> 42:12.274
because they knew this threat
needed to be stopped.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.797
And they believed
that you could stop it.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.880
Now, maybe you're up for it,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.074
maybe you're not.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.833
But the only question
that matters is:

42:25.000 --> 42:26.878
Are you willing to try?
