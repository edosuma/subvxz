00:10.327 --> 00:14.066
What's your biggest secret?

00:14.134 --> 00:15.202
What?

00:15.270 --> 00:18.241
I, uh... Wow.

00:19.409 --> 00:21.411
Good morning.

00:21.478 --> 00:23.313
It's okay, Ryan.
I thought we were there.

00:23.381 --> 00:24.712
Forget I asked.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.012
No, no, no,
it-it's just...

00:28.080 --> 00:31.314
C-Can we just start with
our second biggest secret?

00:31.381 --> 00:34.284
Sure.

00:34.352 --> 00:36.486
Uh, on the count of three.

00:36.553 --> 00:39.022
One, two, three.

00:39.090 --> 00:40.792
- I love you.
- I don't have any clean underwear.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.260
Wait, what?

00:42.328 --> 00:44.329
- Nothing. You were saying?
- You love me?

00:44.397 --> 00:46.364
I'm kidding.

00:46.432 --> 00:48.066
I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry.

00:48.134 --> 00:50.970
That's so not
a second biggest secret, Ryan.

00:51.038 --> 00:52.205
Yeah, a second biggest secret

00:52.273 --> 00:53.906
is, like, I'm afraid of spiders

00:53.974 --> 00:55.974
- or I accidentally beat off to a tranny.
- Can we...

00:56.042 --> 00:57.976
can we just talk about
your underwear again?

00:59.244 --> 01:01.112
Please?

01:02.914 --> 01:05.049
Ryan, do you have
any more rice?

01:05.117 --> 01:06.684
How much do you need?

01:06.751 --> 01:08.318
100 pounds should do it.

01:08.386 --> 01:10.153
Also, I'm going to need
five bushels of wheat,

01:10.221 --> 01:12.188
some sunblock, a hazmat
suit and a crossbow.

01:12.256 --> 01:13.891
No problem.

01:13.958 --> 01:15.092
Oh, wait, I'm out of sunblock.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.860
Fine. We'll make our own

01:16.928 --> 01:19.130
with titanium dioxide
and shredded beeswax.

01:19.197 --> 01:20.865
Okay, why are you...?

01:20.933 --> 01:24.402
Because the world
is ending, Ryan.

01:24.470 --> 01:27.572
Dogs have an intuition
for these things.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.608
Why do you think no dogs
died in the Holocaust?

01:30.843 --> 01:33.646
Because we knew it was coming.

01:33.713 --> 01:38.250
I woke up this morning with an
overwhelming sense of dread.

01:38.318 --> 01:40.253
Something terrible
is going to happen.

01:40.321 --> 01:42.321
It already did.

01:42.389 --> 01:44.556
I think I screwed up
my relationship with Amanda.

01:44.624 --> 01:46.624
And just like that, we're
talking about him again.

01:46.692 --> 01:48.526
I told her I loved her.

01:48.594 --> 01:50.361
I-I... I just got caught up
in the moment.

01:50.429 --> 01:52.297
So tell her you didn't mean it.

01:52.365 --> 01:53.499
But it's the truth.

01:53.567 --> 01:56.436
She makes me feel... normal.

01:56.503 --> 01:57.771
Oh, and I don't?

01:57.838 --> 01:59.105
You're looting my kitchen,

01:59.173 --> 02:00.407
dressed like one
of the Wolverines, so...

02:00.475 --> 02:02.076
Do you not hear me, man?!

02:02.144 --> 02:05.613
Doomsday is upon us.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.014
A massive apocalyptic
nightmare so unimaginable,

02:09.083 --> 02:12.185
grown men will weep
like children,

02:12.253 --> 02:14.120
and the children
that they weep like

02:14.187 --> 02:15.755
will eat other children.

02:15.822 --> 02:18.657
Oceans will boil over,

02:18.724 --> 02:22.755
and fiery death
will rain from the skies,

02:22.822 --> 02:24.356
and the ground

02:24.424 --> 02:27.559
will shake
until the earth itself

02:27.627 --> 02:29.861
will be cleaved into two!

02:39.170 --> 02:41.371
Yeah, that wasn't it.

02:47.944 --> 02:49.144
- Look...
- I just think that...

02:51.280 --> 02:53.279
Look, I'm sorry I ambushed you.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.447
Yeah, you know, if
you're going to get

02:54.515 --> 02:56.515
all relationshippy on me,

02:56.583 --> 02:58.517
- maybe wait for me to have my
first shot of espresso? - I know.

02:58.584 --> 03:00.418
- I know. It was wrong.
- Because, Ryan, I was...

03:00.486 --> 03:02.220
- I just don't want it to be awkward...
- No, I-I-I love you, too.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.856
You do?

03:05.924 --> 03:09.293
Kind of, yeah.

03:09.361 --> 03:10.594
Totally.

03:12.564 --> 03:14.064
You make me really happy, Ryan.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.134
You asked her to
move in with you?

03:17.202 --> 03:18.101
Are you high?

03:18.169 --> 03:19.769
Because you need to be.

03:19.837 --> 03:21.871
That stays in the basement.

03:21.939 --> 03:23.740
From now on, we need
to be more careful

03:23.807 --> 03:26.341
about what we leave
lying around.

03:26.409 --> 03:27.876
Amanda's packing tonight,

03:27.944 --> 03:29.511
and I'm helping her move
in the morning.

03:29.579 --> 03:31.345
Tomorrow morning?

03:31.413 --> 03:32.746
- Are you sure you're ready for this?
- I-I know

03:32.814 --> 03:33.680
we haven't been together
that long,

03:33.748 --> 03:35.614
but it just feels right.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.115
That's not what I mean, Ryan.

03:38.183 --> 03:40.283
I'm saying, maybe you're
not ready for this.

03:40.351 --> 03:42.519
Know what?

03:42.586 --> 03:43.987
I don't care what you think.

03:44.055 --> 03:45.021
Do you care about her?

03:45.089 --> 03:45.988
She loves me.

03:46.056 --> 03:47.623
She doesn't even know you.

03:47.691 --> 03:48.758
She only knows

03:48.825 --> 03:50.960
the you you want her to know.

03:51.027 --> 03:52.995
What about the parts of
you she doesn't know,

03:53.063 --> 03:54.096
the parts you're hiding

03:54.164 --> 03:55.665
down here in this basement?

03:55.732 --> 03:57.166
The black files you used

03:57.234 --> 03:58.934
to manipulate
your father's enemies.

03:59.002 --> 04:01.337
The pills you tried
to off yourself with.

04:01.404 --> 04:03.205
The leather sex hood
you wore to...

04:03.273 --> 04:04.340
Oh, shit, this is mine.

04:04.407 --> 04:05.641
I was looking for this.

04:05.709 --> 04:09.512
Those things aren't me,
not anymore.

04:09.579 --> 04:11.580
These things will
always be you.

04:11.647 --> 04:13.114
They're your secrets.

04:13.182 --> 04:14.781
You think you can
keep them from Amanda

04:14.849 --> 04:16.183
by hiding them down here
in the basement?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.685
Yeah, I do.

04:17.752 --> 04:18.685
You're asking her

04:18.753 --> 04:20.754
to be part of your life.

04:20.822 --> 04:22.556
You're sharing
your house with her.

04:22.624 --> 04:25.359
Sooner or later, she's going
to need to see all of it.

04:26.896 --> 04:29.832
Think of the hours
we spend down here, mate.

04:29.899 --> 04:32.134
How will you explain
where you've been?

04:32.202 --> 04:33.702
Well, maybe I just
need to stop spending

04:33.770 --> 04:34.770
so much time with you.

04:36.573 --> 04:39.475
Look, Wilfred, I love Amanda.

04:39.543 --> 04:42.744
I think she's
really good for me.

04:42.812 --> 04:45.914
Yeah, I-I still have some
issues, but who doesn't?

04:45.982 --> 04:47.215
I'm sure she does, too.

04:50.085 --> 04:52.754
You got something
to say, Wilfred?

04:52.822 --> 04:54.590
No.

04:54.657 --> 04:58.795
It's just, there's a lot
about her you don't know.

04:58.862 --> 04:59.962
Like what?

05:00.030 --> 05:02.665
Well, she talks
too much, for one.

05:02.733 --> 05:05.534
She's always yammering on
and on about God knows what.

05:05.602 --> 05:06.969
And...

05:07.037 --> 05:08.271
What?

05:08.338 --> 05:09.172
Just say it.

05:11.342 --> 05:13.009
She kissed me, man.

05:13.077 --> 05:14.210
It's true.

05:14.278 --> 05:16.212
You've seen how she pets me.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.681
I always figured
it was innocent,

05:17.748 --> 05:20.049
and, you know me,
I'm a dog, I like that shit.

05:20.117 --> 05:22.051
Unbelievable--
you're just jealous.

05:22.119 --> 05:24.220
- Jealous?
- Well, the more time

05:24.288 --> 05:27.189
I spend with Amanda, the
less time I spend with you.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.390
Well, maybe that's
a good thing.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.059
What the hell does that mean?

05:30.127 --> 05:32.228
It means you can be a
really shitty friend.

05:32.295 --> 05:34.664
You say you have my
best interests at heart,

05:34.732 --> 05:37.801
but have you ever once told
me the truth about anything?

05:37.868 --> 05:39.536
More than once.

05:39.603 --> 05:42.806
Ryan, you have to believe me,
this is not going to end well.

05:42.874 --> 05:44.174
You're so full of shit.

05:44.242 --> 05:46.277
I'm telling you,
I can feel it in my bones--

05:46.345 --> 05:48.780
the ones I chew on
and the ones inside of me.

05:48.847 --> 05:50.548
There's a disaster headed
our way.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.483
Give it up, Wilfred.
Amanda and I

05:52.551 --> 05:54.384
are moving in together,
and that's...

05:58.385 --> 05:59.700
Holy shit!

06:01.659 --> 06:06.262
Ryan! Ryan!

06:15.782 --> 06:19.284
Welcome back, Ryan.

06:19.352 --> 06:20.586
Get this off me.

06:20.653 --> 06:23.388
Yeah, and how do I do that?

06:23.456 --> 06:24.789
Seriously?

06:24.857 --> 06:27.926
Go get help!

06:27.993 --> 06:29.427
Of course, I'll
just run upstairs

06:29.495 --> 06:30.995
and tell the first guy I see

06:31.063 --> 06:33.197
that little Timmy's
fallen down the well.

06:37.003 --> 06:39.037
No, quake must have
knocked out the power.

06:39.105 --> 06:40.940
I can't see shit.

06:41.007 --> 06:42.608
You were right, Wilfred.

06:42.676 --> 06:44.777
You said something bad
would happen, and it did.

06:44.845 --> 06:48.047
Unfortunately,
that still wasn't it.

06:48.115 --> 06:52.886
Something else is coming...
something worse.

06:52.953 --> 06:55.355
I'm glad Jenna's out of town.

06:55.423 --> 06:57.090
I hope Amanda's okay.

06:57.158 --> 06:58.425
If you really cared about her,

06:58.493 --> 06:59.626
you'd be honest with her.

06:59.694 --> 07:01.227
You're in no condition

07:01.295 --> 07:02.794
to take this relationship
to the next step.

07:02.861 --> 07:03.961
Enough!

07:04.029 --> 07:06.964
Help! Help me!

07:07.032 --> 07:08.499
Ryan, you're buried
under a box of secrets

07:08.567 --> 07:09.968
with a talking dog

07:10.036 --> 07:11.870
in a basement that
may not even exist.

07:11.938 --> 07:13.505
Do you really think

07:13.572 --> 07:15.307
anyone can possibly hear
your cries for help?

07:18.645 --> 07:19.712
Hello?

07:19.779 --> 07:21.814
Everyone okay down there?

07:21.882 --> 07:23.082
Yes!

07:23.150 --> 07:24.350
Help!

07:24.418 --> 07:25.384
Where are you?

07:25.452 --> 07:27.253
I-I'm pinned down!

07:27.321 --> 07:29.722
Shit, howdy, what a mess.

07:29.789 --> 07:31.490
Let me get...

07:38.932 --> 07:40.866
Thanks.

07:40.934 --> 07:43.402
Don't mention it, Ryan.

07:43.470 --> 07:44.503
Do I know you?

07:44.571 --> 07:46.405
All too well.

07:47.908 --> 07:49.876
Hey, buddy.

07:49.944 --> 07:51.411
Bruce.

07:51.478 --> 07:54.814
Didn't think you'd come.

07:54.882 --> 07:56.483
I gave you my word, Wilfred.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.050
That's why I didn't
think you would.

07:58.118 --> 08:00.486
Wait, you asked him to come?

08:00.553 --> 08:02.888
I needed some dirty work done.

08:02.956 --> 08:04.490
There's no one
dirtier than Bruce.

08:04.557 --> 08:06.425
You flatter me.

08:06.493 --> 08:08.060
Ryan, Wilfred asked
me to get proof

08:08.128 --> 08:09.761
that you shouldn't
move in with Amanda,

08:09.829 --> 08:12.497
and mission accomplished.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.735
What's in the suitcase?

08:16.802 --> 08:18.003
The truth.

08:18.071 --> 08:19.738
Bullshit.

08:19.805 --> 08:21.406
You think you can just dig up
some dirt on Amanda

08:21.474 --> 08:23.375
and it's going to make me
love her any less?

08:23.442 --> 08:25.176
I wouldn't believe it anyway.

08:25.244 --> 08:26.844
No, you would not.

08:26.912 --> 08:28.446
It wouldn't hurt to take
a look, though, would it?

08:28.514 --> 08:30.381
What are you afraid of?

08:42.695 --> 08:44.663
It's going to cost you.

08:44.731 --> 08:46.165
Goddamn it, Bruce.

08:46.232 --> 08:47.967
But it won't be that much.

08:48.034 --> 08:49.702
Just your eternal soul.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.674
Bruce.

08:54.741 --> 08:56.142
All right, I'll do it

08:56.209 --> 08:58.044
for a night out
at Carl's Grub Shack.

08:58.111 --> 09:00.213
Carl's closed down
two years ago, and you know it.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.082
Well, then,
I guess I'll be on my way.

09:02.149 --> 09:03.149
Wait.

09:03.217 --> 09:04.184
How about a game?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.886
That's intriguing.

09:05.954 --> 09:07.655
A game, like last time?

09:07.722 --> 09:09.390
No way.

09:09.457 --> 09:12.460
My life is not a game
to be played for your amusement.

09:12.527 --> 09:13.728
Well, I guess we'll just

09:13.795 --> 09:16.531
have to agree
to disagree about that.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.966
You need to see what's
in the suitcase, Ryan.

09:19.034 --> 09:20.168
We have to play.

09:23.339 --> 09:26.308
French rules, standard protocol.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.510
Wouldn't have it any other way.

09:28.578 --> 09:31.813
Winner gets the suitcase.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.782
I accept.

09:33.849 --> 09:36.918
I had a more interesting
opponent in mind.

09:36.985 --> 09:39.253
- No way.
- Me?

09:39.321 --> 09:41.722
He's a big boy, Wilfred--
he can speak for himself.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.624
What do you say, Ryan?

09:43.692 --> 09:45.360
Are you up for a little game?

09:51.354 --> 09:52.718
Last time you played your game,

09:52.786 --> 09:55.085
I was just the rope
in your twisted tug-of-war.

09:55.153 --> 09:56.818
At least now
I have some control.

09:56.886 --> 09:59.051
But you don't stand a
chance against Bruce.

09:59.119 --> 10:00.918
The only way to win
is not to play.

10:00.985 --> 10:02.451
You play games
with him. You win.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.518
Yeah, well, you're
not me, are you?

10:04.584 --> 10:07.450
I don't know, Wilfred. Am I?

10:07.518 --> 10:10.316
Why are you doing this?

10:10.384 --> 10:11.782
You already said
whatever's in the suitcase

10:11.849 --> 10:13.715
won't change your
mind about Amanda.

10:13.783 --> 10:17.349
It won't, but I want to know.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.416
Well, don't say I
didn't warn you.

10:22.950 --> 10:25.816
Let the games begin.

10:27.351 --> 10:28.916
What's going on?

10:28.983 --> 10:30.849
I can't believe
he'd choose this game

10:30.917 --> 10:32.816
for the first round.

10:32.884 --> 10:35.049
Typical Bruce.

10:35.117 --> 10:37.416
Why? What's he going to do?

10:37.484 --> 10:39.483
Sorry, Ryan.
Moderator can't help.

10:39.550 --> 10:40.916
It's against the rules.

10:40.984 --> 10:42.384
Just be careful.

10:51.252 --> 10:53.084
Why the hell
is he wearing that mask?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.817
Yes! He said it!

10:54.885 --> 10:56.117
He said it.

10:56.185 --> 10:57.417
- Point. Bruce.
- What?

10:57.485 --> 10:59.550
- How did I...?
- The name of the game is

10:59.617 --> 11:01.083
"Why the hell is he
wearing that mask?"

11:01.151 --> 11:02.484
You say that phrase,
Bruce gets a point.

11:02.550 --> 11:03.983
The game is actually called

11:04.051 --> 11:05.383
"Why the hell
is he wearing that mask?"

11:05.451 --> 11:06.849
Whoo! Two-nothing.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.316
What are you doing?

11:08.384 --> 11:09.715
This is ridiculous.

11:38.851 --> 11:40.616
Point. Ryan.

11:40.684 --> 11:42.650
- No! No way!
- Yes.

11:42.718 --> 11:44.817
- The son of a bitch is cheating! No!
- No.

11:44.884 --> 11:46.750
No! No! Are you nuts?

11:46.818 --> 11:48.750
No! No! No! No! No!

11:59.019 --> 12:03.052
What dwells in the blue,
has a sunset face,

12:03.119 --> 12:08.386
with a nose like a dagger
and wood at its base?

12:10.154 --> 12:11.686
- He doesn't know.
- Shut up, Bruce.

12:11.754 --> 12:13.420
Focus, Ryan.

12:13.487 --> 12:16.287
If you lose this round,
it's over and Bruce wins.

12:16.355 --> 12:19.322
Not to mention, you get spanked
with a moose antler.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.456
Come on, it's easy.

12:24.258 --> 12:26.190
I can't help you, mate.

12:26.258 --> 12:29.291
Only two can play.

12:32.058 --> 12:33.824
It doesn't make any sense.

12:33.891 --> 12:35.957
None of this makes any sense.

12:36.025 --> 12:38.191
I-I... I can't do this anymore.

12:38.259 --> 12:39.657
Dude, he's forfeiting.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.491
Ryan, you know this one.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.791
"Only two can play."

12:47.858 --> 12:49.857
Two can...

12:49.925 --> 12:52.258
"What dwells in the blue?"

12:52.326 --> 12:54.824
Blue is the sky.
That means it's a bird.

12:54.891 --> 12:56.724
"A sunset face with a nose
like a dagger."

12:56.791 --> 12:58.424
Meaning a colorful beak.

12:58.491 --> 13:00.424
"With wood at its base."

13:00.491 --> 13:02.557
Th's a branch.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.391
The answer is a toucan.

13:07.092 --> 13:08.524
The answer is Martin Van Buren.

13:08.592 --> 13:10.424
Sorry. Rules are rules.

13:10.491 --> 13:12.057
Martin Van Buren?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.358
Yeah.

13:13.424 --> 13:15.258
I mean, that's obvious.

13:15.325 --> 13:16.824
Sunset face, dude.

13:16.892 --> 13:19.257
He had a severe case of rosacea.

13:19.325 --> 13:21.593
Learn your history, son.

13:21.661 --> 13:24.165
Hey, this was fun.

13:24.232 --> 13:25.605
See you.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.242
I call Monchichi Clown Bubbles.

13:32.082 --> 13:33.916
Those are some serious words.

13:35.152 --> 13:36.486
What's going on?

13:36.554 --> 13:37.821
Sudden death.

13:37.889 --> 13:39.189
You win, you get the suitcase.

13:39.257 --> 13:40.691
If Bruce wins...

13:40.758 --> 13:43.127
I get to cut
Wilfred's tail off.

13:43.194 --> 13:44.762
Wilfred, you can't.

13:44.829 --> 13:46.097
You said I don't have

13:46.164 --> 13:47.531
your best interests
at heart, yeah?

13:47.599 --> 13:48.832
Well, I am literally

13:48.900 --> 13:50.801
putting my ass
on the line for you.

13:50.869 --> 13:52.770
But it's your tail.
If I lose...

13:52.837 --> 13:56.439
I'll just have to tell you
when I'm happy.

13:58.409 --> 14:01.077
Not that I ever will be.

14:01.145 --> 14:03.380
I call the game.

14:03.448 --> 14:05.282
Truth or dare.

14:05.350 --> 14:07.017
It's okay, Ryan.

14:07.085 --> 14:08.519
You've got this.

14:08.587 --> 14:11.489
All you have to do
is choose truth.

14:14.726 --> 14:16.393
Why?

14:16.459 --> 14:18.058
It's why we're down here.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.527
Trust me.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.663
What are you up to?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.167
What's the real game?

14:28.234 --> 14:29.601
What? Ryan.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.069
Dare.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.603
- No.
- Okay.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.938
- going to ruin everything!
- Dare.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.307
I dare you...

14:36.375 --> 14:38.175
to call your father.

14:38.243 --> 14:40.010
What?

14:40.078 --> 14:42.946
Tell him it was your fault
and you want to come back.

14:43.014 --> 14:44.314
You don't have
to do this, mate.

14:44.382 --> 14:45.881
J-Just choose truth.

14:45.949 --> 14:47.549
Choose the truth, Ryan.

14:50.618 --> 14:52.152
Hello?

14:52.220 --> 14:53.620
Ryan?

14:53.688 --> 14:54.921
Damn it.

14:57.892 --> 14:59.826
Truth.

14:59.894 --> 15:01.761
I choose truth.

15:03.998 --> 15:06.766
Game. Ryan.

15:06.834 --> 15:09.002
Congratulations, kid.

15:11.071 --> 15:12.671
You beat me.

15:12.739 --> 15:14.605
- I did?
- Don't get cocky.

15:14.673 --> 15:16.407
You owe me one, buddy.

15:16.474 --> 15:17.775
I'm not your buddy.

15:17.842 --> 15:19.376
Hey, good game.

15:20.644 --> 15:22.878
But I'll get you next time.

15:31.586 --> 15:34.054
I don't feel like I won.

15:34.122 --> 15:36.356
That's the problem
with this particular game.

15:36.424 --> 15:39.292
Even when you win, you lose.

15:40.694 --> 15:42.428
Open the case.

15:51.703 --> 15:53.237
What's inside?

15:53.304 --> 15:55.472
- The truth.
- The truth about Amanda?

15:55.539 --> 15:57.307
No.

15:57.375 --> 15:58.574
Just the truth.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.718
Is this...?

16:10.786 --> 16:12.186
It's a bomb. Holy shit!

16:12.254 --> 16:13.754
The numbers are going up.

16:13.822 --> 16:14.955
It's a timer.
Press the button.

16:19.494 --> 16:20.694
That's how long

16:20.761 --> 16:22.228
you've been down
in your basement

16:22.296 --> 16:24.196
playing a pointless game
with your neighbor's dog

16:24.264 --> 16:26.298
and his... well, Bruce.

16:26.366 --> 16:28.733
12 hours?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.100
This is who you are, mate.

16:32.037 --> 16:33.237
You have to tell her the truth.

16:33.305 --> 16:34.672
No.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.040
No, she loves me.

16:36.108 --> 16:37.542
That's why you
have to let her go.

16:37.609 --> 16:39.477
No. You tricked me.

16:39.545 --> 16:41.412
You lied to me.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.349
You just don't want me
to be happy.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.585
There's nothing wrong with me.

16:51.224 --> 16:52.958
There was an earthquake.

17:12.613 --> 17:13.479
Good morning.

17:17.484 --> 17:19.519
You sure you're ready for this?

17:23.422 --> 17:25.130
I thought you were
going to come over early

17:25.251 --> 17:27.890
- and help me load up my car.
- I overslept.

17:28.017 --> 17:29.325
Yeah, you look like you
haven't slept at all.

17:29.392 --> 17:30.492
Having second thoughts
about me moving in?

17:30.560 --> 17:32.460
Hey, Wilfred.

17:32.528 --> 17:34.362
Did you keep Ryan up all night?

17:34.430 --> 17:35.663
Look, I don't know
how you're set

17:35.731 --> 17:37.965
for storage, but I
have got a ton of stuff.

17:38.033 --> 17:39.366
Uh...

17:41.570 --> 17:43.337
Oh, what's in here?

17:43.405 --> 17:44.538
Ryan.

17:47.610 --> 17:49.811
Amanda...

17:49.879 --> 17:52.247
I haven't been honest with you.

17:52.315 --> 17:55.417
The truth is, I...
I'm not ready for this.

17:55.485 --> 17:59.654
Not ready for us
moving in together or...?

18:02.124 --> 18:04.659
Not ready for us?

18:07.562 --> 18:09.263
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

18:09.331 --> 18:11.365
Look, I...
work is so crazy.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.167
I-I really don't have time
for a relationship.

18:13.234 --> 18:14.902
But you said you loved me.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.538
I...

18:17.605 --> 18:20.207
I thought I did.

18:20.275 --> 18:23.143
Look, you're
a really great girl,

18:23.211 --> 18:25.212
- and...
- This isn't happening.

18:25.279 --> 18:26.947
I'm sorry.

18:27.015 --> 18:29.316
I-I... I just think we need
to take a... a break.

18:34.523 --> 18:36.190
How long?

18:37.659 --> 18:39.326
Long.

18:47.435 --> 18:49.403
But, uh...

18:49.471 --> 18:51.438
I love you.

19:20.902 --> 19:23.804
You were right.

19:23.872 --> 19:27.174
If I really loved her,
I would have told her the truth.

19:29.144 --> 19:31.312
No, I was wrong.

19:31.380 --> 19:35.283
You lied to her
because you love her.

19:35.350 --> 19:38.185
And that's why I lied to you.

19:38.253 --> 19:39.887
You understand that, right?

19:46.128 --> 19:48.229
You knew this would happen.

19:50.465 --> 19:53.433
This is the disaster
you predicted.

20:00.675 --> 20:02.842
Sorry, mate.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.578
That still wasn't it.
