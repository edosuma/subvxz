00:02.045 --> 00:04.116
E. R.

00:04.217 --> 00:05.315
Previously on E. R.

00:05.350 --> 00:09.045
But I'm not leaving this house,
and I don't care if I'm uninvited.

00:09.046 --> 00:11.159
I'm not gonna let your father
break up this family.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.227
You said you were picking up.
Who's lying now?

00:13.262 --> 00:17.348
You're right. The truth is I was searching
your room. I don't know if I can trust you.

00:17.449 --> 00:19.537
You came on to me. You are not out.

00:19.638 --> 00:22.034
I am not out at work.

00:22.135 --> 00:23.354
I don't got time for this.

00:23.455 --> 00:26.159
No! I got stabbed!
Where the hell were you?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.956
Are you gonna blame me
for taking drugs?

00:28.057 --> 00:31.168
No. I am blaming you
for not being my mother!

00:32.304 --> 00:34.508
E. R. 8x12 "A RIVER IN EGYPT"

00:34.679 --> 00:37.215
Who? Who was it?
Who the hell were you talking to?

00:37.387 --> 00:40.054
- The shopping network, I swear.
- At 3 in the morning?

00:40.221 --> 00:42.710
I couldn't sleep.
I just wanted some earrings.

00:43.138 --> 00:46.089
- Don't lie to me.
- Stop it, Brian!

00:46.263 --> 00:48.053
Who were you talking to?

00:48.221 --> 00:49.798
- Nobody.
- Who?

00:49.972 --> 00:52.721
Nobody, I swear. Brian, please.

00:52.888 --> 00:54.547
- Somebody, help me!
- Shut up!

00:54.722 --> 00:56.843
- Help me!
- Shut the hell up!

00:57.014 --> 01:01.920
- Stop it, Brian! Stop it!
- Shut your lying, filthy mouth!

01:12.765 --> 01:17.257
- Rachel, can't sleep?
- I was hungry.

01:17.432 --> 01:19.967
- What are you eating?
- PB and chips.

01:20.140 --> 01:23.553
- It's good.
- Pass them over.

01:26.015 --> 01:29.842
I miss the part where the giant tomato's
chasing Mason Dixon down the sidewalk?

01:30.016 --> 01:32.421
- You know this movie?
- It's a classic.

01:32.599 --> 01:34.720
- I don't really get it.
- What's to get?

01:34.891 --> 01:37.889
- The tomatoes are killers.
- Yeah, I figured that part out.

01:38.058 --> 01:41.471
- This is good.
- Told you.

01:41.641 --> 01:44.390
This reminds me of when
I'd get up at 5:30 in the morning...

01:44.558 --> 01:46.051
...to watch The Smurfs with you.

01:46.225 --> 01:50.135
- You like Smurfs?
- You liked The Smurfs. I liked the news.

01:50.309 --> 01:54.468
- So we did what I wanted to do?
- It's hard to argue with a 2-year-old.

01:58.017 --> 02:00.423
It seems like last week.

02:03.309 --> 02:05.632
We need some milk.

02:06.810 --> 02:08.883
- Watch this.
- What?

02:09.060 --> 02:10.967
Watch.

02:13.435 --> 02:17.476
That's gross. This is so stupid.

02:19.144 --> 02:22.474
- You weren't out, were you?
- No, I went for a walk.

02:22.644 --> 02:25.512
- Where?
- Nowhere.

02:25.686 --> 02:28.091
- Three in the morning?
- It's the only time I can.

02:28.269 --> 02:31.469
- Except you can't.
- I'm under house arrest now?

02:31.644 --> 02:33.682
Not yet, but you're making me
think about it.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.555
You talk to my teachers,
screen my calls, search my room...

02:36.936 --> 02:39.342
...which even my guidance counselor
considers uncool.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.676
- Enough.
- I have to report to the hospital.

02:42.187 --> 02:44.592
- It's like living in a prison.
- Go to bed.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.560
- Mark?
- Here comes the warden.

02:46.729 --> 02:47.759
Hey.

02:47.937 --> 02:50.093
Why won't you
treat me like a thinking person?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.185
- Hey, what's going on?
- Show better judgment, maybe I will.

02:53.354 --> 02:56.021
Yeah, I should have
when I decided to come live with you.

02:56.188 --> 02:58.641
- I said turn it off.
- I just want to watch the movie.

02:58.813 --> 03:00.187
Well, that's too bad.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.641
I'm calling Mom.
I'm moving back to Saint Louis.

03:02.813 --> 03:05.384
- It's not that easy.
- Why? You don't want me here anyway.

03:05.563 --> 03:08.976
Hey, quiet, both of you.
You're gonna wake the...

03:09.147 --> 03:10.805
...baby.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.721
Okay. Thank you.

03:17.355 --> 03:20.307
All set, ma'am.
Your complaint will be kept on record.

03:20.481 --> 03:22.685
My complaint? What about hers?

03:23.022 --> 03:25.855
- She says it was just an argument.
- Yeah, it was an argument.

03:26.023 --> 03:28.227
- He was beating her.
- She says he wasn't.

03:28.398 --> 03:31.100
- She was screaming for help.
- Not anymore.

03:32.773 --> 03:35.440
- Is that it?
- Not much else we can do.

03:35.607 --> 03:37.846
But we appreciate the call.

03:38.023 --> 03:41.270
Okay. Let's get some rest, honey.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.976
You must be a real light sleeper.

04:39.819 --> 04:42.142
- Did I wake you?
- Late shift.

04:42.319 --> 04:47.060
- I'm sorry.
- No, I had to get up in two hours anyway.

04:47.236 --> 04:51.277
- You don't drink coffee.
- Actually, I do.

04:51.444 --> 04:55.308
- I distinctly recall you hating coffee.
- Yeah, when I was 15.

04:56.986 --> 04:59.557
It wasn't that long ago.

05:01.903 --> 05:04.226
What would you like for breakfast?

05:04.404 --> 05:07.852
- Are you offering to cook?
- Momentary weakness. Take advantage.

05:09.071 --> 05:11.145
All right, eggs.

05:11.321 --> 05:16.476
Have you spoken to your father recently?

05:16.654 --> 05:19.357
Yeah, he called a couple days ago.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.979
Where's he staying?

05:23.155 --> 05:26.272
He rented a place on Michigan.

05:26.447 --> 05:28.852
- Scrambled?
- Whatever.

05:29.363 --> 05:33.274
- Do you have his number?
- Yeah.

05:33.447 --> 05:36.445
- Why?
- He didn't give it to me.

05:36.614 --> 05:39.814
- Well, I'm sure that he intends to.
- Did he say something?

05:41.114 --> 05:44.029
Maybe you should just
let it sit for a little while.

05:45.989 --> 05:49.402
Actually, I was hoping
that you would call him for me.

05:51.490 --> 05:56.823
Sure. Or better yet, the three of us
could dip ourselves in a vat of acid.

06:02.740 --> 06:05.194
We made mistakes, John.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.855
I made mistakes, I know.

06:10.033 --> 06:12.568
But I don't believe
that it's too late to fix it.

06:24.075 --> 06:25.319
Sorry.

06:26.617 --> 06:29.485
I know we argue a lot.
We didn't mean to bother you.

06:29.659 --> 06:33.783
- You were screaming for help.
- I know.

06:35.034 --> 06:36.575
I called help.

06:37.368 --> 06:39.986
Brian and I have been together
since high school.

06:40.159 --> 06:43.821
And there's a lot of history
and a lot of passion.

06:43.993 --> 06:46.149
Passion?

06:46.326 --> 06:50.071
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

06:56.994 --> 06:59.317
- Is it your ankle?
- I'm okay.

06:59.494 --> 07:01.947
- Let me take a look at it.
- I don't need any help.

07:02.119 --> 07:05.200
- Joyce.
- I'm sorry, I'm late for work.

07:05.578 --> 07:07.983
- It's gotta be hard.
- She should deal with it herself.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.473
- Maybe she doesn't know how.
- Mom's not the retiring sort.

07:10.536 --> 07:12.066
She's tougher than he is.

07:12.245 --> 07:14.484
Nobody's tough
when your life's falling apart.

07:14.661 --> 07:16.320
You haven't met her yet.

07:16.495 --> 07:17.988
- They're out of vanilla.
- Thanks.

07:18.162 --> 07:20.318
Jennifer Lampkin. Her ex-husband.

07:20.412 --> 07:22.367
Where are we
on Mrs. McCabe's gallbladder?

07:22.537 --> 07:25.156
- I convinced Surgery to take her.
- How'd you manage that?

07:25.329 --> 07:27.782
I explained that she'd
been to the ER over 10 times.

07:27.954 --> 07:29.909
The pain meds were
no longer appropriate.

07:30.079 --> 07:32.947
- They accepted that?
- Even got her Medicaid paperwork started.

07:33.121 --> 07:36.818
That's excellent. I have Attendings
that can't turf a stable patient to Surgery.

07:36.996 --> 07:41.239
Have her call me at the hospital.
It's about Rachel. Thanks.

07:41.413 --> 07:44.115
- What?
- Someone's a teacher's pet.

07:44.288 --> 07:46.611
Rumor is he's about to be
promoted to hall monitor.

07:46.788 --> 07:48.495
- You snitch on somebody, Gallant?
- No.

07:48.663 --> 07:50.987
- What's all this?
- Weaver's got a crush.

07:51.164 --> 07:53.320
I thought I noticed
a little something there.

07:53.497 --> 07:56.330
- Or I'm doing well on my rotation.
- Whatever it takes.

07:56.497 --> 07:59.412
Michael, have you ever seen
the erythema multiforme?

07:59.581 --> 08:01.951
- Just in the books.
- Come here. Now's your chance.

08:02.123 --> 08:04.528
- Oh, so it's "Michael" now, is it?
- Anybody home?

08:04.706 --> 08:08.154
Dr. Greene, 42-year-old prisoner,
stab wounds to the face and abdomen.

08:08.331 --> 08:09.362
Good vitals. ETA, 10.

08:09.540 --> 08:11.530
Give it to Susan.
She's great with inmates.

08:11.915 --> 08:15.281
David Zachery, beat up in a brawl
in an after-hours hip-hop club. No LOC.

08:15.415 --> 08:17.571
- Have trouble breathing, David?
- Ain't my name.

08:17.749 --> 08:19.870
- He goes by "Dimon Z. "
- Do you have chest pain?

08:20.040 --> 08:23.703
- BP, 120/70. Pulse, 90.
- No, my back. And the twins is moping.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.493
- What?
- I got some serious junk damage.

08:26.666 --> 08:29.119
- What does he mean?
- My boys hurt.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.198
- Did you get kicked?
- Not there.

08:31.374 --> 08:34.241
- Okay. Can you wiggle your toes?
- Oh, damn! That kills!

08:34.416 --> 08:36.986
- What happened to your lip?
- Some bitch with a ring.

08:37.166 --> 08:40.198
- Who started all this?
- Bunch of thugs looking to crank a name.

08:40.375 --> 08:43.573
- Oh, yeah? Dimon's famous?
- A major label signed him a month ago.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.540
- Hey, Chuny, can you give...?
- Aisha.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.036
- A room?
- Sure.

08:47.209 --> 08:48.832
You take care of my man, all right?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.703
What's a common etiology
other than drug reaction?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.830
- Viral infection.
- Any one in particular?

08:54.001 --> 08:56.620
- Dr. Weaver, Sandy Lopez called back.
- Herpes?

08:56.834 --> 08:58.576
- What?
- That girl firefighter.

08:58.751 --> 09:00.991
- Right.
- Sandy Lopez from the 38th?

09:01.168 --> 09:02.874
- That hot one?
- The gay one.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.322
Get out of here.

09:04.501 --> 09:06.457
My cousin Rico used to have
a crush on her.

09:06.626 --> 09:10.201
- She wouldn't give him the time of day.
- I saw your cousin. I don't blame her.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.079
Abby, 50 of Benadryl in Exam 1.

09:13.585 --> 09:15.161
Cover the lesions with 1 % hydrocortisone.

09:15.335 --> 09:17.207
- I just got here.
- Clock in, get busy.

09:17.377 --> 09:19.202
She said she'd stop by
before her shift.

09:19.377 --> 09:21.617
- What?
- Lopez.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.159
- You guys friends?
- I treated a man in her unit last night.

09:25.294 --> 09:27.783
Fifteen-foot fall, femur fracture,
blunt head trauma.

09:27.919 --> 09:31.960
Gallant, let's get a good
neuro exam on Mrs. Barisch.

09:32.128 --> 09:33.953
- Abby, you okay?
- What?

09:34.128 --> 09:36.877
- You look a little tired.
- Thank you, Frank.

09:37.837 --> 09:42.080
Grab a gram of cefotetan. BP's stable.
Pulse, 100. Protecting his airway.

09:42.254 --> 09:44.161
- That your prisoner?
- Yeah. What happened?

09:44.337 --> 09:47.122
Jumped in County holding.
He's testifying against a lifer.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.784
I didn't snitch. I was subpoenaed.

09:49.962 --> 09:51.455
No blood in the nares.

09:51.546 --> 09:53.999
Foreface, stable. Neck, non-tender.

09:54.171 --> 09:55.961
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

09:56.129 --> 09:59.044
Four, maybe five superficial cuts
no deeper than the sub-Q.

09:59.213 --> 10:02.828
Draw up 40 cc's of lidocaine.
No rebound or guarding.

10:03.005 --> 10:05.576
- Push a hundred mics of fentanyl.
- No. No drugs.

10:05.755 --> 10:08.208
- You're in pain.
- Reminds me I'm still alive.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.501
- Push the meds.
- They must be next door.

10:11.005 --> 10:13.624
- You get the narc keys, Yosh?
- No scrubs?

10:13.797 --> 10:16.368
- I didn't have time to change.
- Where's a Foley?

10:16.547 --> 10:18.170
Belly's benign, non-tender.

10:19.464 --> 10:21.834
Dimon, we're gonna
have to put a tube in your penis.

10:22.006 --> 10:24.127
- You are so wrong.
- It might be uncomfortable.

10:24.298 --> 10:27.794
- For you, because I ain't doing it.
- We have to check your urine for blood.

10:27.965 --> 10:30.833
I'll pee in the cup, dog.
Keep that tube away from me.

10:31.007 --> 10:33.578
- Carter, your dad's on line two.
- Take a message for me.

10:33.757 --> 10:37.205
DTRs are two plus and equal.
Toes down, going bilaterally.

10:37.382 --> 10:40.961
- Where's the fentanyl?
- They haven't restocked. Try the lock-up.

10:41.132 --> 10:44.664
HemoCue is 14, urine dip is positive
for heme and leukocyte esterase.

10:44.841 --> 10:47.874
- Gross blood?
- No, but it's cloudy.

10:48.049 --> 10:52.090
Okay. Send a UA. Over 50 red cells,
and we'll image the kidneys.

10:52.258 --> 10:54.581
Where did Abby go?
I need a 20 of lido with epi.

10:54.758 --> 10:56.914
I'll get it.
He says he'll call from New Orleans.

10:57.050 --> 10:58.128
- What?
- Your dad.

10:58.217 --> 11:00.373
He's flying to New Orleans at 3.

11:01.425 --> 11:02.882
What?

11:03.050 --> 11:04.958
- How about a head CT?
- It's not necessary.

11:05.134 --> 11:07.622
She's never had headaches before.
Subarachnoid bleed?

11:07.800 --> 11:11.876
That presents as sudden onset of severe
pain. She's got a mild chronic headache.

11:12.051 --> 11:15.002
She could have hydrocephalus.
I think a CT is a good idea.

11:15.176 --> 11:18.873
- An out-patient workup should be fine.
- Okay.

11:20.968 --> 11:24.250
Hi, it's Kerry. I heard you
were gonna come by before your shift...

11:24.426 --> 11:28.586
...but I'm a little backed up here.
So let me call you later.

11:28.968 --> 11:30.545
Thanks. Bye.

11:36.384 --> 11:38.673
- Where's Aisha at?
- Getting her lip sewed up.

11:38.845 --> 11:41.965
- Marcus Welby, I'm gonna live?
- No internal injuries.

11:42.140 --> 11:43.883
I was worried they put a cap in you.

11:44.142 --> 11:46.134
When I go, I'm taking the world with me.

11:46.310 --> 11:48.219
- Can I talk to you?
- This is my boy CC.

11:48.396 --> 11:51.479
- Hey. I want to go over your lab results.
- It's cool. He can stay.

11:51.648 --> 11:54.436
I got to stay in bed for a week,
be waited on hand and foot.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.564
The LS-spine series looks good...

11:58.321 --> 12:01.109
...but your urine was cloudy.

12:01.283 --> 12:03.856
- Is that why it burns when I whiz?
- You got chlamydia.

12:04.035 --> 12:07.368
- Chlamydia?
- The good news is, it's very treatable.

12:07.539 --> 12:10.871
- You get that from nasty booty, right?
- It's sexually transmitted, yeah.

12:12.793 --> 12:15.118
No, Aisha's clean.

12:15.296 --> 12:18.879
- Got any other partners?
- No, man. I love my girl.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.719
- Are you two practicing safe sex?
- Ain't hurt nobody yet.

12:21.885 --> 12:24.637
- That would be a "no. "
- Are you saying Aisha's stepping out?

12:24.805 --> 12:27.640
Well, let's run some more labs.
We'll see where we are.

12:27.807 --> 12:31.141
- I need your consent for the HIV test.
- No, man. She's true.

12:31.312 --> 12:34.596
No, it's standard
for any patient with an STD.

12:34.773 --> 12:37.976
- He needs one of those?
- I'll have the nurse come draw blood.

12:38.818 --> 12:40.775
Whatever.
Hey, can I get some more pudding?

12:40.945 --> 12:42.273
I will see what I can do.

12:43.990 --> 12:46.860
- Abby, can I get a red top in 2?
- Yeah.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.158
- You okay? You look a little-
- Don't say it.

12:49.328 --> 12:51.819
- Tired.
- That seems to be the general consensus.

12:51.997 --> 12:54.867
- Too much clubbing?
- Well, I was up most of the night.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.829
- Really?
- Not for fun.

12:58.003 --> 13:02.664
I don't know, but I think I saw Frank
a little drag-assed this morning too.

13:02.840 --> 13:06.090
You caught me. I was up all night
slapping Frank's ass raw.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.467
- Raw?
- Have you seen him sit down today?

13:08.638 --> 13:11.390
Come to think of it...
Hey, Frank, have you sat down today?

13:11.557 --> 13:12.636
- What?
- Nothing.

13:12.808 --> 13:15.644
- You a little sore today?
- No, why?

13:15.812 --> 13:18.646
Your split lip vagalled
when she saw the lidocaine needle.

13:18.815 --> 13:20.688
- Aisha?
- The rapper's girlfriend.

13:20.857 --> 13:24.357
Better add on a DNA probe.
He's got chlamydia. Dad, hey.

13:24.528 --> 13:25.857
- John.
- I got your message.

13:26.029 --> 13:27.987
No, I was wondering
if you wanted lunch.

13:28.157 --> 13:29.947
Dr. Weaver, Romano called again.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.442
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him you were tied up.

13:32.619 --> 13:35.655
He said to leave your personal life
at home and get to his office.

13:35.831 --> 13:38.866
No, if you're already at Midway,
I'll just come meet you there.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.366
Yeah. Okay. See you then. Bye.

13:41.544 --> 13:45.161
- John, do you know why Dr. Chen's here?
- Deb's here?

13:45.339 --> 13:46.714
Did she say anything to you?

13:46.882 --> 13:49.552
No. Actually, I haven't
really talked to her lately.

13:49.719 --> 13:52.553
Doctor, listen. I wanted to ask you...

13:52.722 --> 13:54.879
- ... can I get me one of them tests?
- What tests?

13:55.057 --> 13:56.220
Chlamydia.

13:56.392 --> 13:59.392
You know that's only contagious
through sexual contact?

13:59.561 --> 14:01.683
Right.

14:03.231 --> 14:05.390
- Right.
- Okay. Right.

14:05.567 --> 14:08.058
- Abby, can you start a new chart here?
- Sure.

14:08.236 --> 14:09.434
You can never trust these ETAs.

14:09.528 --> 14:11.937
I'm still waiting on that hypotensive TC.

14:12.115 --> 14:14.190
- It got diverted to Mercy.
- Oh, great.

14:14.367 --> 14:17.154
I'm waiting for a chest pain.

14:17.328 --> 14:19.036
- Hey, did you reach her?
- Who?

14:19.205 --> 14:20.663
Jen.

14:20.831 --> 14:23.453
- What did she say?
- She wants to think about it.

14:23.626 --> 14:25.499
Think about it? She's her mother.

14:25.669 --> 14:28.160
We can't let Rachel make
these decisions.

14:28.338 --> 14:31.458
Act up, get angry at one
and then punish us by...

14:31.550 --> 14:34.087
moving back to the other.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.253
You know, you might consider
boarding school.

14:36.429 --> 14:40.094
- She could use some structure.
- Yeah, I could sell her off to pirates.

14:40.267 --> 14:45.058
You develop a sense of self-worth,
community, responsibility.

14:45.229 --> 14:47.388
It worked well for me.

14:47.565 --> 14:49.972
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

14:50.150 --> 14:52.855
You're British.

14:53.028 --> 14:56.314
- Mark, she's out of control.
- Thank you, Elizabeth. I'm aware of that.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.566
Yes. And she's disrupting our entire life.

14:58.659 --> 15:00.069
I am working on it.

15:00.243 --> 15:03.410
Are you? Or are you just waiting
for it to blow over?

15:03.580 --> 15:07.363
Julio Echeverria, passed out
in the cab line at the Bismark Hotel.

15:07.542 --> 15:10.542
GCS, 14, complaining of shortness
of breath and chest pain.

15:10.711 --> 15:14.080
- Mr. Echeverria, any heart problems?
- I don't think so.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.961
How many am I getting?

15:19.887 --> 15:21.844
Maybe three more.

15:22.013 --> 15:25.513
You got lucky. These aren't deep.
Whoever did this didn't want to kill you.

15:25.684 --> 15:29.930
- Yeah, I'm well-liked.
- Or you did it yourself.

15:30.105 --> 15:34.102
Misplace that "get out of jail free" card?

15:34.275 --> 15:37.146
Yeah, something like that.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.819
You're the first woman
I've talked to in 14 months.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.660
Yeah, I get that a lot.

15:43.826 --> 15:47.693
In high school I was voted
"most likely to marry a convict. "

15:49.873 --> 15:54.416
- You know, you don't have to do that.
- It could get infected.

15:54.586 --> 15:58.750
Yeah, I wouldn't want to die
before they get a chance to kill me.

15:59.883 --> 16:03.133
- You're on death row?
- Cell number FD414.

16:03.303 --> 16:07.348
Scheduled June 6th, 02.

16:08.683 --> 16:11.849
Almanac says it's gonna rain.

16:12.728 --> 16:15.136
Who believes the weatherman?

16:15.315 --> 16:17.022
Yeah.

16:17.191 --> 16:20.690
Well, at least I know how,
when and where.

16:20.861 --> 16:24.526
Not like all these poor saps
you see every day.

16:24.698 --> 16:29.360
Go to work in the morning
after fighting with their wives.

16:29.536 --> 16:32.537
They never get the chance to say...

16:35.208 --> 16:37.284
...I'm sorry...

16:37.460 --> 16:39.536
...or...

16:39.712 --> 16:41.206
...goodbye.

16:44.550 --> 16:46.756
- I'm out of gauze.
- Would you-? Would you-?

16:48.137 --> 16:50.710
Would you keep me here a while?

16:50.889 --> 16:53.380
Just so...

16:53.558 --> 16:57.805
...I don't have to be there
a little bit longer?

17:01.024 --> 17:04.025
You might need to be observed
for a couple hours.

17:09.741 --> 17:10.939
Thank you.

17:13.911 --> 17:15.618
Kinney, let her go.

17:20.084 --> 17:22.539
I'll straighten him out.

17:23.503 --> 17:25.413
It's all right.

17:27.965 --> 17:31.417
- Don't lose my tie. It's a rental.
- We'll put everything into a bag.

17:31.595 --> 17:34.002
- Where were you going?
- Our Lady of Grace.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.758
Pulse is 90, sats are 95%.

17:35.932 --> 17:38.423
Bilateral crackles
two-thirds of the way up.

17:38.601 --> 17:41.638
- EKG.
- Rather harsh pansystolic murmur.

17:41.813 --> 17:45.063
You have cardiac damage.
Maybe a heart attack started last night.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.731
- I have to go. It's my daughter's wedding.
- I'm afraid you're gonna miss it.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.025
Emesis basin!

17:51.447 --> 17:53.652
And aspirin. Five of Metoprolol.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.397
Probably mitral-valve regurgitation.
We'll need an echo.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.114
Mr. Echeverria, you're too sick
to go anywhere.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.656
We have to put you on a monitor.
Would you like us to call your daughter?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.748
No, don't ruin it.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.785
She'll wonder where you are when
there's no one there to give her away.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.288
She won't.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.295
That was fast.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.006
Nucleic-acid amplification test. It's new.

18:17.221 --> 18:20.922
- What'd it say?
- Positive for chlamydia.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.560
But we can clear that up
with a single dose of azithromycin.

18:25.729 --> 18:29.678
- Is that okay with protease inhibitors?
- You're HIV-positive?

18:30.983 --> 18:33.819
For a year now. I do the clinics.

18:33.987 --> 18:37.819
- Does Aisha know this?
- Aisha? No.

18:38.491 --> 18:40.614
- Zachery.
- Thanks.

18:40.785 --> 18:43.406
- Are you on the triple cocktail?
- My CD4's pretty good...

18:43.580 --> 18:47.623
...but I'm just hoping they'll develop
a once-a-day before too long.

18:48.626 --> 18:49.823
Wait here.

18:50.002 --> 18:54.082
I'm with this girl, her name was Lydia
She was so freak, she gave me chlamydia

18:54.256 --> 18:56.877
That ain't even funny.

18:57.842 --> 19:01.092
- Aisha, can you give us a minute?
- Get me a soda, Boo.

19:01.262 --> 19:04.050
- Root beer?
- You know it.

19:06.726 --> 19:08.635
What's up?

19:09.771 --> 19:13.140
- Your rapid HIV test came back.
- Yeah?

19:17.403 --> 19:19.561
No way.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.397
- I come here with a bum back, and you-
- I'm sorry.

19:25.827 --> 19:28.496
I don't do needles,
and I ain't no faggot.

19:28.663 --> 19:30.490
You're positive.

19:30.665 --> 19:32.160
How?

19:32.334 --> 19:34.492
I don't know,
but Aisha should be tested too.

19:34.669 --> 19:37.669
- I told you, she's clean.
- She needs to be tested anyway.

19:39.590 --> 19:42.378
I got confidentiality, right?

19:44.345 --> 19:46.421
- You can tell her.
- What if I don't want to?

19:47.223 --> 19:50.139
She's at risk. You need to tell her.

19:51.059 --> 19:54.510
The high-five is heavy.
I ain't letting that word spread.

19:54.688 --> 19:58.602
Dimon, it is really important that
we find out how you contracted the virus.

19:58.775 --> 20:02.191
- No root beer, D. Grape?
- Let's jet.

20:02.362 --> 20:05.612
- You need to sit in the chair.
- This is messed up. We're out of here.

20:05.782 --> 20:07.573
No. Aisha, I need to look at your lip.

20:07.742 --> 20:09.534
- We need to run some tests.
- She's fine.

20:09.702 --> 20:11.695
- You could be at risk for STDs.
- At risk?

20:11.871 --> 20:13.614
- What's going down?
- Don't get into it.

20:13.789 --> 20:14.820
- You got it?
- Back off.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.577
- You got to come clean!
- Shut it!

20:16.792 --> 20:18.868
We're past the fronting here, dog!

20:19.044 --> 20:20.918
- You a punk, dog.
- D, are you tripping?

20:21.088 --> 20:23.709
- Shut up! We're going.
- What are you doing?

20:27.553 --> 20:29.212
Enter.

20:30.430 --> 20:34.095
Kerry, your response time
is impressive as always.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.927
I didn't know that we had a meeting.

20:36.394 --> 20:39.478
- You remember Dr. Chen.
- I'm on shift, Robert.

20:39.647 --> 20:41.640
Dr. Chen would like to be reinstated.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.436
We're fully staffed at the moment...

20:45.611 --> 20:48.612
...but if something opens up,
I'll keep you in mind.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.533
I'm not asking you to consider it.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.451
It was your choice to step down.

20:55.620 --> 20:56.949
I've changed my mind, then.

20:57.664 --> 20:59.822
I'm sorry that only with hindsight
you decided-

21:00.249 --> 21:03.500
I didn't decide anything.
You decided I was expendable.

21:04.462 --> 21:06.869
I'm not the doctor that blew out
that man's aorta.

21:07.048 --> 21:10.084
No, you're the doctor who wasn't there.

21:10.552 --> 21:12.793
You were reprimanded
for making a mistake.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.221
The only mistake I made
was allowing you to sacrifice me...

21:16.390 --> 21:18.597
...like you did Malucci,
to save your own ass.

21:18.768 --> 21:21.971
Easy, ladies. If I want to see
a good catfight, I'd watch The View.

21:22.146 --> 21:24.601
Let's try to keep this civil.

21:26.316 --> 21:31.690
I respect your abilities as a doctor,
but the position's already been filled.

21:33.740 --> 21:37.653
We're prepared to file suit unless that
and two other conditions are met.

21:38.411 --> 21:40.569
Dr. Chen's record needs to be expunged.

21:40.746 --> 21:43.866
And an official statement
of correction attached to her file.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.164
We' re trying not to tarnish reputations.

21:46.293 --> 21:47.668
I don't respond well to threats.

21:47.836 --> 21:50.506
- Dr. Weaver.
- You know what? You can't screw up...

21:50.672 --> 21:54.998
...and then whine about being mistreated.
Jing-Mei, you need to grow up.

21:58.562 --> 22:00.436
No, I don't think it's broken...

22:00.606 --> 22:02.895
...but I want to get an x-ray
just to be safe.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.190
He's got it, doesn't he?

22:05.361 --> 22:09.691
- What do you mean?
- Dimon. He's got the high-five.

22:10.742 --> 22:13.743
- What?
- HIV.

22:13.912 --> 22:16.698
We can't discuss Dimon's
medical status with anybody but him.

22:16.873 --> 22:21.700
I feel you. But I see he's tripping,
because he never hit me before.

22:21.877 --> 22:25.128
Does he know that you're HIV-positive?

22:26.007 --> 22:30.669
My viral load's been zero. He only gives.

22:30.845 --> 22:33.882
I told him, "Wear a rubber anyway. "

22:34.057 --> 22:38.055
He said, "What for? "
It wasn't sex to him.

22:38.604 --> 22:40.014
He's on the DL.

22:43.316 --> 22:46.900
- The DL?
- Down low.

22:48.197 --> 22:52.408
See, he ain't gay.

22:52.576 --> 22:55.411
You can't be a faggot and be legit.

22:56.205 --> 22:59.242
He only does guys
because women get so stressful.

23:01.585 --> 23:04.076
Does Aisha know about this?

23:05.130 --> 23:07.669
I was just keeping it going...

23:07.842 --> 23:11.258
...waiting for the day
he'd come around and get real.

23:12.179 --> 23:13.377
I didn't even think about her.

23:13.514 --> 23:15.222
CC, it's really important we find her.

23:17.351 --> 23:21.219
- She has a pager. I don't know the digits.
- Think you can get it?

23:21.606 --> 23:24.891
- I can try.
- Thank you.

23:29.447 --> 23:32.116
Order a Water's view
to rule out an orbital-rim fracture.

23:32.283 --> 23:34.110
Page me if he gets that number.

23:34.285 --> 23:38.912
- So "down low" is bisexual?
- No, "on the side," "in secret. "

23:39.082 --> 23:41.787
- "In the closet"?
- To be in the closet, you have to be gay.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.958
- He is gay.
- CC's gay. Dimon's on the down low.

23:46.131 --> 23:48.669
Well, if he's having anal sex
with his friend, he's gay.

23:48.842 --> 23:51.843
Not to him. He's got a girlfriend.
He just gets down for release.

23:52.011 --> 23:53.885
- So "down low" means "in denial"?
- Yeah.

23:54.055 --> 23:55.882
- Have you injured it before?
- No.

23:56.057 --> 24:00.138
- You feel a pop or a snap?
- I'm not sure.

24:00.312 --> 24:02.304
- Over the bone or to the side?
- Both.

24:02.481 --> 24:04.473
- Okay. There?
- Yeah.

24:04.650 --> 24:07.567
All right, that's a pretty good sprain.
How'd you do that?

24:07.737 --> 24:09.563
My husband bought me
those roller shoes.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.945
I was practicing in the apartment.

24:12.116 --> 24:15.449
- It turns out I was worse than I thought.
- Has the swelling increased?

24:16.454 --> 24:20.665
- You triage her?
- We're neighbors. I saw her this morning.

24:20.833 --> 24:25.210
Oh. Could be an avulsion off
the lateral malleolus. Get an ankle series.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.830
Is it broken?

24:29.008 --> 24:32.508
I don't see a fracture, but Dr. Weaver's
gonna have to check it out.

24:32.679 --> 24:36.427
- Am I gonna have to get crutches?
- Maybe until you can bear weight.

24:36.599 --> 24:39.683
You're gonna need help getting around.
How are you getting home?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.976
I called Brian.

24:43.648 --> 24:47.598
It's not all him, you know.
I give as good as I get.

24:49.187 --> 24:55.122
Well, I don't see him
sitting in an ER needing x-rays.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.534
Well, it's not the way it seems.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.370
Our walls are pretty thin, Joyce.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.868
He's the only guy I've ever loved.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.503
Will you talk to a social worker?

25:10.676 --> 25:13.546
Someone with experience
who could maybe help you lay out...

25:13.720 --> 25:16.970
...some ways you might want
to deal with this.

25:17.850 --> 25:22.761
Joyce, I think you came here
for a reason. I can help you.

25:22.938 --> 25:27.185
Yeah. I came here because I didn't want
to answer a bunch of questions.

25:28.069 --> 25:30.904
If a patient with the same history
presents again tomorrow...

25:31.072 --> 25:33.527
...I expect you to order
the workup I requested today.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.898
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

25:35.076 --> 25:37.531
Dr. Weaver, glad I caught you.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.910
You can go away now.

25:40.456 --> 25:44.075
I was gonna page you, but I couldn't
be sure you'd be wearing your pager.

25:44.252 --> 25:48.000
Robert, you're not gonna be intimidated
by these baseless accusations.

25:48.173 --> 25:51.258
- They have someone on record, Kerry.
- About what?

25:51.426 --> 25:53.585
A waitress at that dump
across the street said...

25:53.678 --> 25:55.422
you were looking for your pager...

25:55.597 --> 25:59.891
...the night Chen and Malucci killed
that guy. That's an important detail.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.720
- Robert-
- I don't need to hear it.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.428
No explanation. No spin. Just fix it.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.604
- Fix what?
- All she wants is an Attending position...

26:08.068 --> 26:11.437
...with standard pay scale
and a personal apology from you.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.902
- I can't do that.
- A first time for everything.

26:14.075 --> 26:16.612
I wouldn't have any kind
of authority over her.

26:16.785 --> 26:19.193
We've settled with
this dead kid's family.

26:19.372 --> 26:22.408
I won't open it up again because
you have a management problem...

26:22.583 --> 26:25.370
...created by your own
negligence and deceit.

26:25.545 --> 26:28.581
She's not interested in taking you down.
All she wants is her job.

26:28.756 --> 26:33.798
Give it to her today. And super-glue
the pager to your forehead if you have to.

26:35.638 --> 26:39.552
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Julio Echeverria. He had a heart attack.

26:39.725 --> 26:41.517
Check in at the desk down the hall.

26:41.602 --> 26:43.311
Dr. Weaver, I need help in Trauma 2.

26:43.479 --> 26:46.646
- That's Dr. Lewis.
- Sats are dropping.

26:48.485 --> 26:51.106
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

26:51.279 --> 26:56.190
Fifteen liters by mask.
Sir, I need you to take a deep breath.

26:56.367 --> 26:58.490
- Did you get a 12-lead?
- No ischemic changes.

26:58.619 --> 26:59.651
What happened?

27:00.163 --> 27:02.322
Decreased breath sounds on the right.

27:02.499 --> 27:04.408
Lung exam was normal 15 minutes ago.

27:04.584 --> 27:07.538
- Is this new?
- Yeah, they had to straighten me out.

27:07.963 --> 27:11.047
- Prep for a chest tube. I need lidocaine.
- What are you doing?

27:11.216 --> 27:12.758
A broken rib collapsed your lung.

27:12.926 --> 27:15.299
We need to put a tube in
to help you get oxygen.

27:15.471 --> 27:16.633
- No.
- We have to.

27:16.888 --> 27:19.676
- I don't want it.
- You'll die if we don't inflate your lung.

27:19.850 --> 27:22.056
- I don't care. I'm ready.
- Ten blade.

27:22.227 --> 27:24.635
Hold on, Kerry. We need consent.

27:24.814 --> 27:28.182
- I'm done anyway. Please.
- Kerry.

27:28.359 --> 27:31.859
A curved Kelly.
Susan, I need the Kelly now.

27:32.029 --> 27:35.030
Please. They'll keep beating on me.

27:35.699 --> 27:38.866
Susan, open up some Vaseline gauze.

27:39.912 --> 27:41.371
Susan, now.

27:45.084 --> 27:47.041
Sorry. I was looking for a parking place.

27:47.211 --> 27:48.587
You want a drink? I'm boarding.

27:48.755 --> 27:51.704
- I should be boarding now.
- No, thanks.

27:51.883 --> 27:56.212
- So, what's so urgent?
- Nothing really. I was just checking in.

27:56.637 --> 27:59.046
- So how's the new place?
- Sparsely furnished.

27:59.224 --> 28:02.095
- But there's something to be said for that.
- For sparseness?

28:02.269 --> 28:04.676
- Final boarding for all passengers.
- Clarity.

28:04.854 --> 28:06.598
If I knew your mother was moving in...

28:06.773 --> 28:09.229
...I would have taken
some of the New York furniture.

28:09.401 --> 28:13.446
Yeah. She mentioned to me
that she doesn't have your new number.

28:13.614 --> 28:15.441
You should give her a call, check in.

28:15.616 --> 28:18.451
- Why?
- You were married to her.

28:18.619 --> 28:21.739
She wants to negotiate. Who knows
when she started looking at life...

28:21.914 --> 28:26.575
...the way other people
read the stock reports, but it's over.

28:26.752 --> 28:28.709
I don't think she shares that assessment.

28:28.879 --> 28:31.584
- You're her ambassador now?
- No.

28:31.757 --> 28:36.050
I'm just suggesting you take time
to make sure this is what you want.

28:36.679 --> 28:38.636
I do. Thanks to you.

28:39.890 --> 28:42.049
- Me?
- I was part of this lie...

28:42.226 --> 28:47.469
...this illusion we were living
in order to hold it together.

28:47.649 --> 28:50.186
It took losing Dad and thinking
about what you said...

28:50.359 --> 28:54.856
...to make me see that I was lost.

28:55.031 --> 28:57.818
I can't find my way back with her.

28:59.035 --> 29:00.778
Final boarding call to all passengers.

29:00.870 --> 29:02.199
I don't know.

29:02.372 --> 29:05.290
I've never, ever seen her
reach out like this before.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.452
That's my flight.

29:07.627 --> 29:11.874
Careful, John,
she's an emotional vampire.

29:16.219 --> 29:17.499
Is he dying?

29:18.221 --> 29:23.677
He's had a pretty big heart attack.
He may need surgery to replace a valve.

29:29.941 --> 29:31.815
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

29:33.779 --> 29:36.187
I was scared
you wouldn't want me there.

29:37.115 --> 29:38.989
After all this time, you show up now?

29:39.785 --> 29:42.192
I've got 200 people waiting.

29:42.371 --> 29:44.992
Go. Go.

29:45.165 --> 29:47.622
Be happy.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.707
Six years and nothing?

29:56.885 --> 29:58.677
Why, Papi?

29:58.846 --> 30:01.930
I should have let you come back home.

30:03.309 --> 30:04.887
It was a mistake.

30:06.563 --> 30:09.018
Why now?

30:10.358 --> 30:12.849
My little girl's getting married.

30:13.903 --> 30:16.275
It's supposed to be
the best day of my life.

30:16.823 --> 30:18.899
I'm sorry.

30:19.325 --> 30:21.318
I didn't mean to ruin it.

30:22.537 --> 30:24.779
And you're not going to.

30:24.957 --> 30:29.951
I'm happy now.
Rene is a wonderful man.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.798
And I don't need you anymore.

30:35.842 --> 30:38.381
Maria?

30:38.554 --> 30:39.752
Miss Echeverria.

30:39.930 --> 30:42.765
I've got the best caterer in Chicago
setting up at the Hilton.

30:42.933 --> 30:44.891
- Let me talk to you.
- Nothing's refundable.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.812
- Your father is very sick.
- I don't care.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.898
- Don't leave it like this.
- He didn't care when I called him...

30:51.067 --> 30:53.273
...from Wichita, begging him
to let me come back.

30:53.444 --> 30:56.895
- He wanted to see you get married.
- Look, he abandoned me. Okay?

30:57.073 --> 31:00.193
Turned his back. Nobody does that.
Only a stubborn, heartless man.

31:00.701 --> 31:04.746
- He's trying to reconnect.
- You're not gonna make me cry.

31:04.914 --> 31:08.199
This makeup took three hours.

31:11.796 --> 31:14.583
- He was fine when I left him.
- I didn't touch him.

31:14.758 --> 31:16.584
He has broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.795
He was flailing against the side rails.
We had to restrain him.

31:19.971 --> 31:23.257
- With your nightstick?
- Why do you care? He's a murderer.

31:23.433 --> 31:27.134
He killed two teenage kids
on the way to a movie.

31:27.979 --> 31:30.649
Oh, my God. Get it off of him.
What happened?

31:30.815 --> 31:33.271
I was looking at the x-ray,
and he flipped the gurney.

31:33.444 --> 31:35.103
Are you all right? Help us!

31:35.320 --> 31:36.435
Chest tube's out of his Thora-Seal.

31:36.613 --> 31:38.772
- Asystole!
- No, no, no, he pulled his leads off.

31:38.949 --> 31:41.619
One, two, three.

31:43.537 --> 31:47.451
- Mr. Kinney.
- Low sats. He's dropping to 85.

31:47.666 --> 31:50.288
- Mr. Kinney, open your eyes.
- Blood from the ear canal.

31:50.461 --> 31:52.453
Mr. Kinney?

31:53.089 --> 31:55.758
Left pupil is 9 millimeters and sluggish.

31:55.924 --> 31:58.961
GCS is 1-2-1. Probably an epidural bleed.

31:59.136 --> 32:02.801
Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.
An 8-O ET tube. Bag him, Susan.

32:03.516 --> 32:05.175
Get a head CT and call Neurosurgery.

32:05.351 --> 32:08.056
Kerry, the guy's gonna die
in a couple months by lethal injection.

32:08.229 --> 32:10.601
- Bag him now.
- He asked for no heroic measures.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.813
He's a death-row inmate
attempting suicide.

32:12.984 --> 32:15.309
He can't ask for a DNR.

32:16.654 --> 32:18.812
Tube him now.

32:20.616 --> 32:22.656
Whatever you say, Kerry.

32:23.995 --> 32:26.830
- Hey.
- I got your message.

32:26.998 --> 32:32.123
- Yeah, we've been backed up all day.
- You told me to come by.

32:32.295 --> 32:37.123
Actually, I left another message on your
machine that I'd get back to you later.

32:37.300 --> 32:41.168
Well, I'm here. Okay?
I came to see Marty from the 38th.

32:41.346 --> 32:44.383
- What do you want to say?
- Dr. Weaver, Dr. Chen's looking for you.

32:44.558 --> 32:46.467
Yeah, tell her to wait.

32:46.643 --> 32:50.641
I just wanted to make sure that you
were all right. I heard it was a big fire.

32:50.814 --> 32:53.352
- I'm fine.
- Good. Good.

32:53.525 --> 32:56.098
Can you sign an order
for a social-services consult?

32:56.279 --> 32:58.437
- They won't come without a signature.
- Not now.

32:58.614 --> 33:02.742
Well, it's Joyce Westlake. The ankle.
There is domestic violence involved.

33:02.910 --> 33:06.409
Yeah, I'll come down and talk to her.

33:08.374 --> 33:10.366
So that's it?

33:10.877 --> 33:12.620
What?

33:12.795 --> 33:17.540
- You're gonna keep playing this game?
- I'm not playing a game.

33:18.384 --> 33:21.670
- So you just want to check on me?
- Is that all right?

33:21.846 --> 33:23.637
Just write the order, I'll take care of it.

33:23.723 --> 33:27.222
No, I'm the treating physician. Okay?

33:28.895 --> 33:32.145
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

33:33.858 --> 33:34.973
Why are you avoiding?

33:35.068 --> 33:38.401
I'm not. Can you tell I'm a bit swamped?

33:38.571 --> 33:41.822
Kerry, excuse me, you want
to talk to me, talk to me. Okay?

33:41.992 --> 33:44.115
I'm not gonna hang around
for your convenience.

33:44.286 --> 33:46.243
- You know, forget it.
- Please wait.

33:46.413 --> 33:48.157
- No. Bye.
- Let me just check on-

33:48.332 --> 33:50.074
- Sandy-
- You know-

33:57.883 --> 34:00.288
Goodbye, Dr. Weaver.

34:11.172 --> 34:15.217
- You packed me a lunch?
- We call this an escape kit.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.885
Money, medication, phone numbers,
anything you might need is in here.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.335
For what?

34:21.141 --> 34:24.012
In case one night you decide...

34:24.186 --> 34:26.511
...you don't feel safe
and you have to get out.

34:26.730 --> 34:30.395
He's my husband.
I don't need that to feel safe.

34:31.192 --> 34:33.944
Okay. But it can't hurt
having it around. Right?

34:34.112 --> 34:36.520
- So I'll put it with the rest of your stuff.
- Hi.

34:36.697 --> 34:40.565
Hi. Joyce, this is Adele.
She's a social worker here at the hospital.

34:40.744 --> 34:43.947
- I told you I don't need a social worker.
- In situations like this...

34:44.121 --> 34:46.494
...it's policy for me
to interview the patient.

34:46.666 --> 34:49.335
- Situations like what?
- Abby, I need you.

34:49.502 --> 34:52.074
Brian's gonna be here.
If he finds her, he'll get upset.

34:52.254 --> 34:55.255
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Well, has that happened before?

34:55.925 --> 34:58.594
Kid named Ricky gets on the phone,
transfer to Trauma 1.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.006
- Who?
- Choirboy.

35:00.179 --> 35:02.800
He's gonna hold up the phone
from the church vestibule.

35:02.973 --> 35:04.931
Did you see it?

35:05.100 --> 35:07.058
- What?
- Me either,

35:07.144 --> 35:09.599
but I heard it was steamy.

35:10.439 --> 35:14.104
Your rehiring will necessitate
the scaling back of the hours of others...

35:14.277 --> 35:17.819
...so don't be surprised
if your return is not met with open arms.

35:17.988 --> 35:20.859
I'm sure they'll look to you
for any scheduling complaints.

35:21.033 --> 35:23.073
You start tomorrow at 7.

35:23.243 --> 35:25.200
- A.M.?
- P.M.

35:25.371 --> 35:28.324
- You're putting me on overnights.
- Under the circumstances...

35:28.498 --> 35:31.950
...I don't think you're in any position
to complain about your schedule.

35:32.127 --> 35:35.827
You know that's not true, Kerry.
So let's stop lying. Okay?

35:36.715 --> 35:39.669
I'm getting my job back
with the following conditions.

35:39.843 --> 35:44.172
- I didn't agree to any conditions.
- I'm returning as an Attending.

35:44.347 --> 35:46.968
I expect shift equity and equal pay.

35:47.141 --> 35:50.842
I'll report to more experienced faculty,
but not to you.

35:51.604 --> 35:53.347
We both know what you did here.

35:55.233 --> 35:57.474
Yes.

35:57.652 --> 35:59.312
And we know what you did too.

35:59.487 --> 36:02.440
So while we're being truthful,
let me just say...

36:02.615 --> 36:05.284
...it's not me with blood on my hands.

36:05.367 --> 36:06.826
If you were a more thorough doctor...

36:06.994 --> 36:10.908
...you wouldn't have
needed me there in the first place.

36:13.291 --> 36:17.159
- A kiss could mean anything.
- Not that kind of kiss.

36:18.338 --> 36:20.829
I guess Kinney's
gonna get executed after all.

36:21.007 --> 36:24.459
The inmate. He's in a post-op coma,
not even triggering the vent.

36:24.636 --> 36:26.178
Well, we did what we had to do.

36:26.346 --> 36:29.264
$4000 a day to keep
this guy alive so they can kill him...

36:29.432 --> 36:31.639
...hardly seems like
the best use of resources.

36:31.810 --> 36:37.184
You know what? Just save the patients.
I'll worry about our resource management.

36:37.357 --> 36:38.555
Oh, John.

36:38.734 --> 36:41.022
- Is Dr. Carter here?
- Welcome back.

36:41.194 --> 36:42.771
- Carter.
- Thank you.

36:42.945 --> 36:45.021
- Aisha. See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

36:45.197 --> 36:48.781
I got a page. Dimon's always had an act,
but I thought he was real with me.

36:48.952 --> 36:51.620
No, no, I'm just glad you came back.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.998
- What do you need, Malik?
- Nothing.

36:57.167 --> 37:00.204
Yeah. Well, then why don't you
find something to do.

37:02.214 --> 37:06.164
Warm for January. Maybe we'll luck out
and have a mild winter.

37:06.344 --> 37:09.884
- Why are we going this way?
- Thought it'd be nice to walk by the river.

37:10.055 --> 37:13.840
- I have a lot of homework.
- I called your mom today.

37:14.018 --> 37:16.555
And did you tell her I'm going back?

37:16.728 --> 37:20.809
We talked about it,
and I decided that it wasn't good for us.

37:21.900 --> 37:25.269
- You and me, or you and Mom?
- You and me.

37:26.571 --> 37:31.364
- I don't have a say?
- Maybe in a few years, but no, not yet.

37:32.494 --> 37:34.616
Rachel, I want you to stay here.

37:36.414 --> 37:38.537
I missed too many things in your life...

37:38.625 --> 37:40.368
to let you leave angry with me.

37:42.504 --> 37:46.122
I'm your father. I'm not gonna
pass you off when things get rough.

37:47.258 --> 37:50.295
And what makes you think
things will get better?

37:50.470 --> 37:54.633
We both try harder.
Neither one of us is very good at listening.

37:54.807 --> 37:56.966
I just don't want to be treated like a kid.

37:57.268 --> 38:00.518
Good. I don't want to be
treated like an old man.

38:02.690 --> 38:05.856
- Brian? Brian?
- Hi. What happened?

38:06.026 --> 38:09.027
Hi. Everything's okay.
Joyce's ankle was bothering her.

38:09.196 --> 38:10.738
She sprained it pretty badly.

38:10.907 --> 38:14.358
I told her those things don't have
ankle support. She's not a great skater.

38:14.535 --> 38:16.990
They can be dangerous.

38:17.162 --> 38:20.911
Listen, I'm sorry you got pulled
into this little domestic drama.

38:21.083 --> 38:24.499
- I think you got the wrong idea.
- Evidently, I did.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.457
We have tempers. And once in a while
things get out of hand.

38:27.631 --> 38:31.005
- This is really none of my business.
- If it infringes on your life, it is.

38:31.176 --> 38:34.260
Our neighbor in San Francisco
thought there was an earthquake.

38:34.429 --> 38:37.963
It was just Joyce smashing
all my softball trophies because...

38:38.140 --> 38:39.422
...I went to a game...

38:39.518 --> 38:41.890
...instead of going out with her folks
when they were in town.

38:42.979 --> 38:45.221
Right.

38:45.398 --> 38:47.604
They told me Room 3. It's over here.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.400
Yeah, it is. Joyce is almost finished.

38:49.569 --> 38:52.320
You could pull your car around,
and I could wheel her out.

38:52.488 --> 38:54.148
- And we can meet you.
- I can get her.

38:54.323 --> 38:56.197
But it's a long walk to the parking lot.

38:56.367 --> 39:00.531
And she's really supposed to stay
off the ankle for a day or two. So...

39:00.705 --> 39:03.491
- Well, is there a problem?
- Abby?

39:03.666 --> 39:06.583
- I'll talk to you later.
- Thank you.

39:06.752 --> 39:12.208
- Hey, baby. How's it going?
- Better. The throbbing stopped.

39:13.717 --> 39:16.255
- Did they give you lots of drugs?
- A few.

39:16.428 --> 39:19.844
- You hungry?
- A little. Yeah.

39:22.100 --> 39:26.429
Why don't we go over to Angelino's
and get some pasta, a bottle of merlot?

39:26.605 --> 39:29.178
- I feel more like a cheeseburger.
- It's your call.

39:29.357 --> 39:32.275
- Thanks, Abby.
- Is this yours, Joyce?

39:32.444 --> 39:35.564
No, I have what I came with.

39:36.364 --> 39:38.191
Bye.

39:46.165 --> 39:47.825
- Who are you?
- We got a call, Kerry.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.535
- No. I mean, who the hell are you?
- I live my life without apologies.

39:51.712 --> 39:55.544
Right. You make choices for your life.
You don't make choices for mine.

39:55.716 --> 39:58.207
I didn't choose to be lied to
or have my time wasted.

39:58.386 --> 40:01.887
- I never misrepresented myself.
- You pretend to be something you're not.

40:02.348 --> 40:03.890
- Lopez, let's go!
- You know what?

40:04.058 --> 40:06.631
It's my employees,
my colleagues, my workplace.

40:06.810 --> 40:09.515
I choose to keep my private life
to myself.

40:09.688 --> 40:11.847
You can't separate
who you are from what you do.

40:12.065 --> 40:13.607
That is not your decision to make.

40:13.692 --> 40:15.899
I stand up and face it every day.

40:16.070 --> 40:19.320
You want the life without hardship.
You don't get one without the other.

40:19.490 --> 40:21.399
Not with me anyway.

40:21.575 --> 40:25.240
So you did this out of spite
to teach me some kind of lesson?

40:26.079 --> 40:29.827
I did you a huge favor.
You just don't know it yet.

40:47.266 --> 40:51.762
- What are you doing?
- The light went out.

40:51.937 --> 40:55.271
- Why don't you tell Henry?
- I'm not incompetent.

40:55.441 --> 40:58.395
I'm capable of changing a light bulb.

40:58.569 --> 41:01.486
- Damn it.
- Here. Come down from there. I'll get it.

41:01.655 --> 41:05.024
- No, screw it. I'll get it later.
- Whoa.

41:06.369 --> 41:08.776
Have you been drinking?

41:09.789 --> 41:13.204
Norman Tucker sent Millicent a bottle...

41:13.375 --> 41:17.040
...of 40-year-old Bordeaux
as a get-well gift.

41:17.212 --> 41:19.288
And you what,
helped her open it?

41:19.464 --> 41:25.333
I spent the entire afternoon at that
children's cancer center for Millicent.

41:25.804 --> 41:29.007
There was this one boy...

41:33.061 --> 41:36.430
I came home, and I made the mistake
of getting in the middle...

41:36.606 --> 41:41.813
...of an argument between
Millicent and her physical therapist.

41:42.486 --> 41:46.531
Yeah, Gam's having a little trouble
losing her independence.

41:49.577 --> 41:53.111
Hey, hey. Sit down.

41:55.291 --> 42:01.079
She told me that my presence was,
in fact, hindering her recovery...

42:01.672 --> 42:06.250
...that if she needed a caregiver
I would be the last person she'd call.

42:06.426 --> 42:07.671
That's a defense mechanism.

42:07.845 --> 42:11.011
- What are you doing?
- Checking your pulse.

42:12.433 --> 42:15.006
Did you speak to your father?

42:15.185 --> 42:18.103
Sixty and weak.
Are you taking something?

42:18.271 --> 42:20.560
Xanax.

42:22.025 --> 42:25.525
- He's giving up on me.
- When did you start taking Xanax?

42:26.237 --> 42:29.191
- I have a prescription.
- And you took it with alcohol.

42:37.373 --> 42:42.331
- How many pills did you take, Mom?
- I'm so sorry.

42:42.503 --> 42:44.709
I'm sorry. You shouldn't
have to go through this.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.873
How many?

42:47.049 --> 42:49.208
Two.

42:50.637 --> 42:53.258
I just took two.

42:59.395 --> 43:02.312
She asked me to leave.

43:03.690 --> 43:06.857
Do you want me to leave, John?

43:10.531 --> 43:12.571
No.

43:15.202 --> 43:17.444
You're right.

43:19.081 --> 43:21.702
I've failed you.

43:23.877 --> 43:27.044
I failed your brother.

43:27.839 --> 43:31.255
- And then I failed you.
- Mom...

43:31.426 --> 43:34.593
He was tired before we left for France.

43:34.679 --> 43:36.505
That was 20 years ago.

43:36.681 --> 43:40.927
Millicent insisted he just needed
some fresh air.

43:41.102 --> 43:42.975
He'd been inside all winter.

43:44.481 --> 43:47.267
It delayed the diagnosis
by less than a month.

43:47.441 --> 43:49.897
It wouldn't have changed anything.

43:52.946 --> 43:55.520
I was his mother.

43:58.828 --> 44:04.451
I just stood by while
it was eating him alive.

44:07.878 --> 44:09.952
I just stood by.
