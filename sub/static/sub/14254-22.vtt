00:12.012 --> 00:13.639
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:13.713 --> 00:15.180
A sensor analysis

00:15.248 --> 00:17.944
would have provided
the necessary information.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.508
Just admiring the view.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.952
The conference begins
in less than an hour.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.081
There's always time
for warp field dynamics,

00:24.157 --> 00:26.990
but you don't see natural
beauty like this every day.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.389
What was that?

00:30.463 --> 00:32.954
Some kind of energy barrier
directly below us.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.727
lt spans thousands
of square kilometers.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.234
Why didn't our sensors
detect it?

00:37.303 --> 00:38.361
l'm not certain.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.632
lt has an unusual
tetryon signature.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.608
Species 312 used a
similar technology.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.850
There's a power surge
coming from the barrier.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.908
Shields at full.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.388
They're creating
some kind of feedback.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.390
We've lost impulse engines.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.152
Go to warp.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.356
The warp core is off-line.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.021
Warp engines
don't just shut down

01:04.096 --> 01:05.724
when you scrape
an energy barrier.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.494
lt's affecting all our systems.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.499
Warning.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.034
Structural failure
in 30 seconds.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.570
We'll have to beam
to the surface.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.901
We can't transport
through the barrier.

01:13.973 --> 01:16.168
Transfer auxiliary power
to the weapons array.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.470
What are you trying to do?

01:17.544 --> 01:19.273
lf l can realign our phasers
to the correct

01:19.345 --> 01:21.279
frequency, l may be
able to open a rift.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.178
Big enough to get
a shuttle through, l hope.

01:23.249 --> 01:26.184
Warning. Structural failure
in ten seconds...

01:26.252 --> 01:28.652
nine... eight...

01:28.721 --> 01:30.188
Phasers reconfigured.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.314
...five...

03:37.650 --> 03:39.208
The barrier's closed again.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.888
l should examine you.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.157
l don't think it's serious.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.812
You have a hairline fracture.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.440
We've got bigger problems.
l'll be fine.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.013
l'm detecting
shuttle debris scattered

04:14.087 --> 04:16.180
over several square kilometers.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.483
Some of it
might still be functional.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.785
lf we can find
the right components,

04:18.858 --> 04:19.790
we may be able

04:19.858 --> 04:22.419
to construct a beacon,
send a distress signal.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.793
Through the barrier?

04:26.532 --> 04:27.863
Maybe.

04:29.802 --> 04:33.568
lf we hurry, we might
still make that conference.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.906
Well, if we have
to be stranded somewhere,

04:37.977 --> 04:40.275
you couldn't ask
for a nicer place.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.870
We wouldn't be
stranded at all

04:41.948 --> 04:44.974
if you hadn't insisted
on admiring the view.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.824
Guest Vessel 7 4656,

04:58.898 --> 05:00.126
this is Ledos Port Control.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.359
Shut down your engines.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.128
This is Lieutenant Tom Paris.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.703
ls there a problem?

05:04.771 --> 05:07.569
You were observed committing
Piloting Violation 256.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.973
l'm sorry, l'm not familiar
with your regulations.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.511
lt won't happen again.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.876
You will be informed
of the penalty.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.881
What kind of ''penalty''?

05:16.949 --> 05:18.416
That's not my decision.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.452
Your docking permit
says you're assigned

05:20.520 --> 05:22.181
to the Starship Voyager.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.120
That's right.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.179
Your commanding officer

05:25.258 --> 05:28.591
will be notified
of your infraction.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.787
Piloting lessons?

05:29.862 --> 05:31.124
Well, apparently,

05:31.197 --> 05:32.994
the standard penalty
for your infraction

05:33.066 --> 05:34.829
is a three-day course
in flight safety

05:34.901 --> 05:36.232
followed by a test.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.701
Well, did you explain to them

05:37.770 --> 05:39.203
that we wouldn't be here
that long?

05:39.272 --> 05:41.263
Well, actually, while you were
completing your mission,

05:41.374 --> 05:42.841
Seven was invited
to a four-day conference.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.137
Here on Ledos?

05:45.211 --> 05:46.178
l decided to give

05:46.279 --> 05:47.507
the entire crew shore leave.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.877
lt'll give you plenty of time

05:48.948 --> 05:50.540
to brush up
on your piloting skills.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.777
l don't need lessons.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.252
Apparently,
the authorities disagree.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.118
But, Captain...

05:57.190 --> 05:58.418
You may not have known

05:58.491 --> 06:00.823
the Ledosians' rules,
but you know ours.

06:00.893 --> 06:03.054
Comply with local law,
understood?

06:03.129 --> 06:06.155
Yes, ma'am.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.737
The relays are fused.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.783
lt's useless.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.784
Looks like we're not
the only ones here.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.156
lndigenous wildlife, perhaps.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.162
l'm reading
residual life signs.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.822
They're humanoid.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.126
Ledosian?

06:40.199 --> 06:44.795
No, but they share the
same genetic traits.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.031
Whoever they are, they
may be able to help us.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.937
Unless they're hostile.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.841
Why don't we give them
the benefit of the doubt?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.937
The life signs lead
in that direction.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.040
l suggest you rest your leg
while l investigate.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.517
lt's better if we
stick together.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.282
At least until we know
whether they're hostile.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.435
l'm guessing they're pre-warp.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.841
Obviously, they can't help us.

07:25.912 --> 07:30.178
No... l don't
suppose they can.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.012
But they're fascinating,
aren't they?

07:32.084 --> 07:35.315
l never expected
to run into people like these

07:35.388 --> 07:37.083
on such a technologically
advanced planet.

07:37.156 --> 07:40.648
This isn't an anthropological
mission, Commander.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.819
You're right.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.863
We should keep
searching for debris...

07:52.405 --> 07:55.374
You're developing an infection.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.409
You should rest.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.477
l'll have to stay here

07:58.544 --> 07:59.943
and try to keep out of sight.

08:00.012 --> 08:03.311
l'll contact you
if l find anything useful.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.749
l guess l don't
have to tell you

08:05.785 --> 08:08.777
to avoid interacting
with these people.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.927
Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.968
Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.412
Commander, respond.
l found something.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.712
Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.080
Don't...!

10:06.439 --> 10:07.497
Step away from him.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.644
lt's all right, Seven.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.179
They're friendly.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.714
They're treating my wound.

10:27.927 --> 10:31.294
You said we were supposed
to avoid interaction.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.559
They found me. There
was nothing l could do.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.827
You should have tried
to contact me.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.528
l didn't want to expose
them to our technology.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.006
You hid your combadge?

10:41.140 --> 10:43.165
Actually, your call scared them.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.469
They broke it.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.239
l suggest we leave
before they break anything else.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.873
Look, they're friendly...

10:49.949 --> 10:51.211
and l am hurt.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.251
What are you suggesting?

10:53.319 --> 10:54.786
We may as well stay the night.

10:54.854 --> 10:55.912
Commander...

10:55.988 --> 10:57.012
lt's good shelter,

10:57.123 --> 10:59.387
and my leg feels better
since they put

10:59.458 --> 11:00.425
this dressing on.

11:00.526 --> 11:03.393
l'm going to get some rest.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.829
l suggest you do the same.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.569
Chell says we shouldn't
miss the flame gardens.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.806
l hear the arboretum
is beautiful, too.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.904
We can do both.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.005
Tom!

11:57.083 --> 11:58.015
You joining us?

11:58.084 --> 11:59.016
Oh, that's right.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.347
You have to go to pilot school.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.851
l hear the course takes days.

12:02.922 --> 12:03.889
Yeah, for most people,

12:04.023 --> 12:05.422
but l did a little research.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.857
lf the instructor agrees,
you can skip the lessons

12:07.927 --> 12:09.258
and go right to the test.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.523
So, l will be seeing you
in a couple of hours.

12:11.597 --> 12:14.566
You have to admire his optimism.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.624
Just a moment, sir.

12:23.709 --> 12:27.201
l am Mr. Kleg,
the flying instructor.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.076
Are you Lieutenant Paris?

12:29.148 --> 12:30.740
He is.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.716
lt's an honor to meet you, sir.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.412
May l show you
to the Delta Flyer?.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.818
Why?

12:35.888 --> 12:38.550
So you can explain
what l did wrong

12:38.624 --> 12:40.285
and then administer the test.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.519
lt sounds to me

12:41.594 --> 12:44.290
like you need lessons
in patience, as well.

12:44.363 --> 12:45.295
Oh, Tom is

12:45.364 --> 12:47.161
very patient, sir.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.098
Never impulsive.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.635
Take all the time you need.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.535
He'll enjoy
the extra attention.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.471
Well, l'm pleased to hear it.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.305
We'll start with a review
of safety procedures.

12:58.377 --> 12:59.309
Do you have a visual

12:59.378 --> 13:01.869
display system l can access?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.881
l think l can find one.

13:03.916 --> 13:04.780
Have fun.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.515
Energize.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.790
So, how long will
this ''review'' take?

13:13.859 --> 13:17.386
Oh, typically
about four hours,

13:17.463 --> 13:18.521
but there's no rush.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.366
Of course not.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.372
River.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.315
River.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.067
Mountain.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.533
Mountain.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.710
Where... are we?

14:26.131 --> 14:27.325
This?

14:36.508 --> 14:40.376
You want to trade.

14:40.446 --> 14:43.415
Well, l suppose it won't hurt.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.652
l'll take that as a ''thank you.''

15:01.133 --> 15:03.397
Did you make
a favorable exchange?

15:03.502 --> 15:05.629
l didn't want to
insult their customs.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.796
Any luck?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.874
l may have found a way
of communicating.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.635
Me, too.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.176
l've learned how
to say ''thank you.''

15:12.278 --> 15:13.643
l was referring

15:13.712 --> 15:14.974
to communication
with Voyager.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.776
lt may be possible
to construct a beacon

15:16.849 --> 15:18.180
by connecting
these components

15:18.250 --> 15:19.444
to the shuttle's deflector.

15:19.518 --> 15:20.576
Did you find it?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.484
l detected it
six kilometers from here.

15:22.554 --> 15:23.816
l believe it's intact.

15:23.889 --> 15:26.255
l'm not sure l'm up
to that long a trip.

15:26.325 --> 15:29.089
l'll go.

15:29.161 --> 15:31.186
l've started mapping the area.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.356
Here's the river we passed.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.626
This is where we beamed down

15:34.700 --> 15:36.292
and we're here now.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.803
Then the deflector should
be approximately here.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.340
Six kilometers is a long way.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.308
Maybe one of them
could guide you.

15:44.376 --> 15:45.365
l'm still trying

15:45.477 --> 15:47.468
to limit our contact
with these people.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.343
The sooner we get
to the deflector,

15:49.415 --> 15:51.542
the sooner we can
get out of here.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.811
They know the terrain.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.512
Maybe they can
get you there faster.

15:54.586 --> 15:55.678
And watch me construct

15:55.754 --> 15:57.483
a tetryon-based
signaling device?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.616
All right, but be careful.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.131
Seven.

16:08.233 --> 16:12.033
This is how they say ''good-bye.''

17:15.501 --> 17:16.968
Thank you.

17:27.613 --> 17:28.580
Hello.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.096
ldentify yourself.

19:20.359 --> 19:23.988
An exothermic reaction.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.849
l'm not hungry.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.770
lnadequate system integration.

20:06.838 --> 20:11.798
Visibility impaired
by lateral sensor array.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.471
lnsufficient console
accessibility...

20:15.547 --> 20:17.139
You know, l
couldn't agree more.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.945
Those are just
some of the defects

20:19.051 --> 20:21.110
that led to my so-
called ''pilot error.''

20:21.186 --> 20:22.517
Polarity thrusters?

20:22.588 --> 20:27.753
Oh! They've been known to cause
accidental acceleration.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.293
Exactly my point.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.489
Why should l be held responsible
for the ship's design flaws?

20:32.564 --> 20:35.931
According
to the maintenance records,

20:36.034 --> 20:38.332
you were this vessel's
chief designer.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.735
l make it a point
of professional pride

20:40.806 --> 20:42.967
to research every case
l'm assigned to.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.543
Are you familiar with that term,
Lieutenant?

20:45.644 --> 20:47.544
Professional pride?

20:47.613 --> 20:48.739
Yes, sir.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.172
ln fact, that is why

20:51.250 --> 20:53.150
l am so eager to get underway.

20:53.218 --> 20:56.278
l want to prove to you
that l am a good pilot.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.983
There are protocols, Mr. Paris.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.924
System by system diagnostics,
preflight simulations...

21:02.027 --> 21:04.928
You must have other students
who need your attention.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.658
lt wouldn't be fair to...

21:06.732 --> 21:08.893
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

21:09.067 --> 21:13.197
l'm planning to spend as much
time with you as you need.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.988
Good morning.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.480
l'm trying to go here.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.004
Can you show me?

22:51.069 --> 22:52.536
Yes.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.308
l thought it was this way.

23:17.629 --> 23:19.893
Yes, it's quite
an impressive view,

23:19.965 --> 23:21.762
but now we really have...

23:52.364 --> 23:54.093
My friend...

23:55.967 --> 23:58.265
She hasn't come back.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.429
l need to find her.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.644
She looks like this.

24:16.254 --> 24:18.347
Where?

24:29.401 --> 24:31.164
Where did you get this?

24:55.460 --> 24:58.554
My friend.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.120
Where?

25:19.150 --> 25:19.946
Don't touch that!

25:22.153 --> 25:23.085
Please.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.232
Problem?

25:44.342 --> 25:46.139
Commander Chakotay
failed to report in

25:46.211 --> 25:47.269
at the scheduled time.

25:47.345 --> 25:49.472
We tried hailing,
but there was no response.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.448
We contacted
the conference coordinator.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.541
He said Seven and Chakotay
never showed up.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.210
Anything on sensors?

25:55.287 --> 25:56.515
We located
a hull signature

25:56.588 --> 25:57.953
over the southern
subcontinent,

25:58.089 --> 26:00.853
but it's only a wing.

26:00.926 --> 26:02.985
Nothing else? No life signs?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.824
No, ma'am.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.694
That's awfully low
for something to be in orbit.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.063
lt's not in orbit.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.069
lt's resting on
an energy barrier.

26:12.137 --> 26:14.765
We think the shuttle may
have collided with it.

26:14.873 --> 26:16.170
Why didn't they see it?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.004
Standard scans
didn't reveal its presence.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.340
We were only able to detect it
with our Borg sensors.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.811
lf all you found was a wing,

26:21.880 --> 26:24.110
maybe the rest of the shuttle
made it through the barrier.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.013
Logic suggests that possibility.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.644
Unfortunately, the barrier
is deflecting all our scans.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.347
There's no way to know

26:30.422 --> 26:33.016
if the shuttle or its occupants
are on the other side.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.618
Hail the Ledosian Ambassador.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.662
We'd have warned your Commander,

26:39.731 --> 26:41.790
but his flight plan didn't go
anywhere near that area.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.357
He must have altered his route
for some reason.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.336
And collided with the barrier.

26:46.404 --> 26:47.598
l'm sorry.

26:47.706 --> 26:49.674
We're not assuming they're dead.

26:49.741 --> 26:52.141
We believe they may
have found a way through.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.507
That's very unlikely.

26:53.578 --> 26:55.512
They're resourceful people.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.741
Can you tell us anything
about the barrier?

26:57.816 --> 27:00.182
lt shields the territory
of an indigenous society--

27:00.251 --> 27:01.684
the Ventu.

27:01.753 --> 27:03.311
Then the area's habitable.

27:03.388 --> 27:04.980
lf you lowered the barrier,

27:05.056 --> 27:07.251
we could scan
for our people's life signs.

27:07.325 --> 27:09.452
l'm afraid we can't do that.

27:09.527 --> 27:10.619
Why not?

27:10.695 --> 27:12.595
lt was erected by aliens

27:12.664 --> 27:14.359
hundreds of years ago.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.195
They haven't been back.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.826
The technology
is a mystery to us.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.428
Why did these aliens
build the barrier?

27:21.539 --> 27:23.200
To protect the Ventu.

27:23.274 --> 27:24.673
From whom?

27:24.743 --> 27:26.210
Us.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.871
Our ancestors fought them,
polluted their habitat.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.416
l'm afraid we weren't
very enlightened back then.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.317
Earth went through its dark
periods too, Ambassador.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.788
Would you have any objections
if we tried to lower the barrier

27:38.857 --> 27:40.688
just to scan for our people?

27:40.759 --> 27:42.488
l told you, it's not possible.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.221
Perhaps if you
gave us information

27:44.295 --> 27:45.887
about the barrier's
power source.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.555
The generator is inside.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.532
There's no way to access it.

27:49.634 --> 27:52.899
Even if your people did survive,

27:53.004 --> 27:56.064
l'm afraid
there's no way to get them out.

28:01.780 --> 28:06.080
Captain's Log, Stardate 54827.7.

28:06.151 --> 28:07.914
Although the Ledosians
are skeptical,

28:07.986 --> 28:10.352
they're allowing us
to try to locate our people.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.548
Meanwhile, we've begun

28:11.623 --> 28:13.352
to analyze
the shuttle fragment.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.017
The burn pattern suggests

28:15.093 --> 28:16.355
a tetryon flux.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.692
We found a reference
to similar technology

28:18.763 --> 28:20.526
in Seven's Borg database.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.589
You think the Borg erected it?

28:22.667 --> 28:25.830
No, but it may have been
constructed by people

28:25.970 --> 28:28.871
they later assimilated--
Species 312.

28:28.973 --> 28:31.441
lf Seven were here,
she might be able to figure out

28:31.543 --> 28:32.737
a way to get through it.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.745
Maybe she already did.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.678
Some of the damage to
the wing was caused

28:36.748 --> 28:38.579
by feedback from the
shuttle's phasers.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.675
Seven and Chakotay
might have used them

28:40.752 --> 28:42.879
to penetrate the barrier
for some reason.

28:42.987 --> 28:44.477
lf l can determine

28:44.556 --> 28:45.716
the appropriate frequency,

28:45.790 --> 28:47.417
l may be able
to do the same thing.

28:47.492 --> 28:48.686
But there is risk involved.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.022
What sort of risk?

28:50.095 --> 28:51.892
lt looks like
the feedback from the barrier

28:51.963 --> 28:53.191
is what destroyed the shuttle.

28:53.264 --> 28:54.356
lf we're not careful,

28:54.432 --> 28:56.423
the same thing could
happen to Voyager.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.990
May l see those?

29:35.140 --> 29:36.402
Seven.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.032
ls everything all right?

29:38.143 --> 29:40.111
l need your tricorder.

29:43.314 --> 29:44.576
Nice to see you, too.

29:44.649 --> 29:48.085
l lost mine.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.212
There's a strong
magnetic field here

29:50.288 --> 29:53.416
that's preventing me from
generating a deflector beam,

29:53.491 --> 29:55.220
but the field drops off

29:55.293 --> 29:59.593
approximately 4.8 kilometers
in that direction.

29:59.664 --> 30:01.598
Can you transmit the
signal from there?

30:01.666 --> 30:02.826
Not through the barrier,

30:02.901 --> 30:04.232
but l may be able
to neutralize it

30:04.335 --> 30:06.360
by generating a dampening field
with our deflector.

30:06.471 --> 30:10.805
Even if you're right,
this must weigh 500 kilos.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.240
How would we move it?

30:15.180 --> 30:16.647
Some of them could help us.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.113
We shouldn't involve them.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.481
Do l detect a change
in attitude, Commander?

30:24.055 --> 30:25.317
Your concern was justified.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.483
They've been gathering
debris from the shuttle,

30:27.559 --> 30:28.821
using it to imitate us.

30:28.893 --> 30:30.451
l don't want them helping.

30:30.528 --> 30:31.825
What's the alternative?

30:31.896 --> 30:33.158
Staying here?

30:33.231 --> 30:35.165
Allowing them to find
all of the debris?

30:35.233 --> 30:36.723
lf we neutralize the barrier,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.769
Voyager can transport us
and our technology

30:38.837 --> 30:39.963
off the surface.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.665
ls there a possibility
that this dampening field

30:42.774 --> 30:44.833
could disrupt the
barrier permanently?

30:44.943 --> 30:45.910
Unlikely.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.477
Once the deflector
is deactivated,

30:47.545 --> 30:49.012
the barrier should reinitialize.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.344
Let's hope you're right.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.946
So, you can execute a turn

30:59.023 --> 31:00.752
at less than 300 KPH.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.292
Well done, Lieutenant.

31:02.327 --> 31:03.760
Thanks.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.524
You know, l don't want
to seem impatient again,

31:06.598 --> 31:07.758
but is there any way

31:07.832 --> 31:09.766
that you'd let me
take that test now?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.063
l thought l made myself clear
about that.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.228
All my students

31:13.338 --> 31:15.431
complete the entire course.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.064
Well, l understand, sir,

31:17.175 --> 31:19.405
but two of my friends
are missing,

31:19.477 --> 31:21.672
and l'd like to help find them.

31:21.746 --> 31:23.213
Well, that's
an admirable sentiment,

31:23.281 --> 31:24.748
but if l give you
special treatment,

31:24.816 --> 31:26.215
it wouldn't be fair
to the others

31:26.284 --> 31:27.945
who have to take this course.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.280
Besides...

31:29.354 --> 31:30.946
why stop now?

31:31.055 --> 31:34.991
You're getting very close
to becoming an adequate pilot.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.735
Here, Commander.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.850
Not so close.

32:10.228 --> 32:12.856
Phasers are starting
to overload.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.796
Can we divert any more
power to the shields?

32:14.866 --> 32:17.733
The shields are amplifying
the feedback.

32:19.003 --> 32:20.334
The barrier's interfering

32:20.405 --> 32:22.032
with every system we activate.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.903
Cease fire.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.605
l'm open to suggestions.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.409
We may be able

32:30.481 --> 32:31.914
to reconfigure a photon torpedo

32:31.983 --> 32:33.917
to detonate
at the appropriate frequency.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.452
What about feedback?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.784
A torpedo
shouldn't create any...

32:37.855 --> 32:39.152
theoretically.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.223
Do it.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.902
They're too close.

32:55.540 --> 32:56.802
Back...

32:56.874 --> 32:58.808
behind the rise.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.173
Stay back.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.599
The energy barrier's
coming down.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.897
l thought you were
still reconfiguring

33:25.036 --> 33:25.900
the torpedo.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.095
l am.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.173
lt's being deactivated
from the inside.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.730
Harry, scan for life signs.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.309
Aye, Captain.

33:39.417 --> 33:40.406
Take it off!

33:47.225 --> 33:49.159
l'm only reading one combadge.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.524
lt's Seven's.

33:50.595 --> 33:51.687
Open a channel.

33:51.763 --> 33:52.855
Janeway to Seven.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.261
Are you and Chakotay all right?

33:54.332 --> 33:55.424
Yes, Captain.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.491
Stand by for transport.

33:57.568 --> 33:58.933
Lock on to Commander Chakotay.

33:59.037 --> 33:59.969
l need more time.

34:00.038 --> 34:00.970
ls there a problem?

34:01.005 --> 34:01.937
Someone's been injured.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.838
She requires
medical attention.

34:03.908 --> 34:04.966
Do you need the Doctor?

34:05.076 --> 34:06.168
l believe l can treat her.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.575
A medkit would be useful.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.612
Acknowledged.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.808
Captain's Log, supplemental.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.148
Seven has remained
on the surface

34:15.219 --> 34:17.516
to tend
to the injured Ventu girl

34:17.588 --> 34:20.614
while Chakotay's
being treated in Sick Bay.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.424
The poultice healed
the fracture and the infection.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.087
l'm impressed.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.755
They're impressive people.

34:27.831 --> 34:29.891
l just hope we haven't
traumatized them.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.467
You did what you had to do
to get out of there.

34:32.536 --> 34:33.936
Still, l think
we should transport

34:34.005 --> 34:35.597
all the shuttle debris
back to Voyager

34:35.706 --> 34:36.764
as soon as possible.

34:36.873 --> 34:38.501
Agreed.

34:43.648 --> 34:46.172
Would you like some breakfast?

34:49.719 --> 34:51.516
l'm not hungry, either.

35:00.264 --> 35:03.358
l admire your curiosity,

35:03.468 --> 35:05.595
but you should be more careful.

35:07.638 --> 35:09.538
lt's time for me to leave.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.073
Back to my home.

35:24.589 --> 35:28.047
That's very kind,
but l have no use for it.

35:32.997 --> 35:36.455
l suppose l should respect
your customs.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.031
Thank you.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.276
These botanical specimens

35:46.344 --> 35:48.938
indicate a high level
of serum nitrates.

35:49.013 --> 35:51.038
Catalog those foliates.

35:51.115 --> 35:52.377
Explain your presence here.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.712
Oh.

35:53.784 --> 35:54.910
You must be from Voyager.

35:54.986 --> 35:55.918
Who are you?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.079
My name is Barus.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.247
l'm the expedition leader.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.187
What kind of expedition
are you leading?

36:00.291 --> 36:01.986
We're conducting
scans to evaluate

36:02.026 --> 36:03.493
the potential of this habitat.

36:03.561 --> 36:04.926
Potential for what?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.396
Anthropological research,
resource development...

36:07.465 --> 36:09.092
We've been waiting years
for this.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.499
What about the people
who live here?

36:11.602 --> 36:13.695
We'll help them, of course.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.203
How?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.331
With medicine,

36:16.440 --> 36:18.305
infrastructure, education...

36:18.376 --> 36:22.244
Whoever lowered this barrier
did the Ventu a great favor.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.081
That barrier has to go back up.

36:33.157 --> 36:34.351
lsn't it possible

36:34.425 --> 36:37.326
the Ledosians will improve
the lives of the Ventu?

36:37.395 --> 36:38.521
lmprove them... how?

36:38.596 --> 36:40.188
They're intelligent people.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.698
Exposure to education
and technology

36:42.767 --> 36:44.394
may give them
better opportunities.

36:44.502 --> 36:45.434
Can you honestly say

36:45.503 --> 36:46.970
that you know
what's better for them?

36:49.240 --> 36:50.935
No, l can't.

36:51.075 --> 36:54.738
Then what do you think
we should do?

36:54.812 --> 36:56.780
l'm uncertain.

36:56.847 --> 36:59.407
lt's not like you
to be on the fence.

37:00.751 --> 37:03.948
When Commander Chakotay and l
first encountered the Ventu,

37:04.021 --> 37:06.046
l found them primitive,
of little interest

37:06.123 --> 37:08.523
to me, but as l spent more
time with them, l came

37:08.593 --> 37:10.117
to realize that they're

37:10.194 --> 37:12.526
a resourceful,
self-reliant people.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.566
Their isolation may limit
their potential,

37:15.633 --> 37:17.726
but if that isolation ends,

37:17.835 --> 37:20.463
so will a unique way of life.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.630
We appreciate your help
in opening this territory

37:22.740 --> 37:24.435
to exploration, Captain.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.874
lt's an unprecedented
opportunity.

37:26.944 --> 37:29.174
A short-lived opportunity,
l'm afraid.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.579
l don't understand.

37:31.649 --> 37:34.482
After l transport our
deflector back to Voyager,

37:34.552 --> 37:36.645
the energy barrier
will go back up.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.882
Naturally, you'll want
to get your people out,

37:38.956 --> 37:41.186
so they won't be trapped inside,
as ours were.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.092
You have no right to limit
our access to our own territory.

37:44.161 --> 37:46.755
l'm not trying to do that,
but we have a strict policy

37:46.831 --> 37:49.800
about leaving our technology
in the hands of other cultures.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.528
lt often has
damaging consequences.

37:51.636 --> 37:53.797
l don't think you realize
how important it is.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.872
lt's not only the resources
that interest us.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.374
The Ventu are
our evolutionary ancestors--

37:58.442 --> 38:01.240
our living history.

38:01.345 --> 38:03.336
l understand this is
disappointing for you,

38:03.381 --> 38:04.973
but l'm afraid l have no choice.

38:05.049 --> 38:09.577
ln the spirit of cooperation,
l hope you'll reconsider.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.519
We're eager to resume course.

38:11.589 --> 38:15.525
Would an hour be enough time
for you to evacuate your people?

38:15.593 --> 38:18.323
l'll make the arrangements.

38:23.401 --> 38:25.028
We've transported
all the remaining debris

38:25.136 --> 38:26.262
to the cargo bay.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.736
l have a lock
on the deflector assembly.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.273
What is it?

38:30.341 --> 38:31.831
There's a Ledosian vessel

38:31.942 --> 38:33.102
on an intercept course.

38:33.177 --> 38:34.303
lt's charging weapons.

38:34.378 --> 38:35.504
Shields.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.641
Direct hit to the transporters.

38:40.718 --> 38:41.742
They're off-line.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.684
Get a weapons lock
and hail them.

38:43.754 --> 38:45.415
They're hailing us.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.421
Captain Janeway.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.855
What's going on?

38:47.925 --> 38:49.051
Our government has decided

38:49.126 --> 38:50.684
not to let you
restore the barrier.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.355
And that justifies
an unprovoked attack?

38:53.431 --> 38:54.898
We only targeted
your transporters

38:54.999 --> 38:56.227
to avoid harming your crew.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.029
l hope you'll show
the same restraint.

38:58.135 --> 39:01.263
l don't find weapons fire
of any kind restrained.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.772
lf you want to avoid
further conflict,

39:03.841 --> 39:05.138
l suggest you leave.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.071
Take us out of orbit.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.010
What about the deflector?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.072
ls Tom still in the Flyer?.

39:12.149 --> 39:13.844
-Yes, ma'am.
-Hail him.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.522
Excellent, Mr. Paris.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.182
Now, come about slowly.

39:21.258 --> 39:23.021
Janeway to Paris. Respond.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.925
Captain, l would appreciate it

39:24.995 --> 39:27.190
if you wouldn't
interrupt my student

39:27.264 --> 39:28.731
during his examination.

39:28.799 --> 39:30.198
l'm sorry,
but something's come up.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.325
What is it, Captain?

39:31.435 --> 39:33.198
Tom, l'm sending you
some encrypted orders.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.635
Yes, ma'am.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.765
This is highly irregular.

39:44.782 --> 39:45.874
You're going much too fast!

39:45.950 --> 39:46.882
Yes, sir.

39:47.017 --> 39:48.746
l'm in a bit of a hurry.

39:48.819 --> 39:51.049
lf you have any desire
to pass this test,

39:51.122 --> 39:53.215
you'll reduce your speed
immediately.

39:53.290 --> 39:54.552
l wish l could do that, sir.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.115
l really do.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.197
What was that?

40:01.265 --> 40:03.062
Paris to Voyager.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.259
l'm under attack.

40:04.368 --> 40:05.960
Give him some help, Mr. Tuvok.

40:17.014 --> 40:18.538
What have you done?

40:18.616 --> 40:20.948
We had to get you out of there
before we closed the barrier.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.451
You can't do that.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.188
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.383
Paris to Voyager.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.652
l've got them.

40:28.726 --> 40:29.954
Find the deflector.

40:30.027 --> 40:33.519
l'm getting a lock on it now.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.192
My transporters are off-line.

40:37.301 --> 40:39.462
You better get
out of there, Tom.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.162
Not yet. l've got an idea.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.833
l am sorry to inform you,
Mr. Paris, but you have failed

40:44.942 --> 40:45.909
this examination.

40:45.976 --> 40:46.965
You will no longer

40:47.077 --> 40:48.669
be allowed to operate a vessel

40:48.746 --> 40:49.940
within Ledosian space.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.881
Something tells me that's
not going to be a problem.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.103
This is a beautiful blanket.

41:22.179 --> 41:24.044
Take it if you like.

41:24.114 --> 41:25.604
l don't need it.

41:25.683 --> 41:27.947
lf environmental
systems ever go down,

41:28.018 --> 41:29.645
you might get cold.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.956
-l...
-You know...

41:34.024 --> 41:35.184
You first.

41:35.259 --> 41:36.453
Please, continue.

41:37.528 --> 41:41.794
ln all the excitement,
l never apologized.

41:41.866 --> 41:43.197
For what?

41:43.300 --> 41:45.291
Causing you to miss
that conference.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.372
As a matter of fact, l...

41:49.473 --> 41:51.941
wanted to thank you for that.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.340
l thought you were angry.

41:53.410 --> 41:54.377
l was.

41:54.478 --> 41:55.740
But you were right--

41:55.813 --> 41:58.338
warp mechanics
can be studied anytime.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.781
The Ventu, on the other hand...

42:02.820 --> 42:04.754
Something's still bothering you.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.559
l'm concerned
for their well-being.

42:09.627 --> 42:11.754
They know how
to take care of themselves.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.057
That's not what l mean.

42:13.130 --> 42:16.258
Members of the Ledosian
expedition had the opportunity

42:16.333 --> 42:18.324
to scan my deflector
modifications.

42:18.402 --> 42:21.633
ln time, they may find a way
to duplicate our technology

42:21.739 --> 42:23.673
and remove the barrier
themselves.

42:23.741 --> 42:26.107
l suppose it's possible.

42:26.176 --> 42:29.942
lf l had never made
those modifications...

42:30.014 --> 42:31.641
We might
still be stranded there.

42:34.919 --> 42:37.513
l don't know about you,

42:37.588 --> 42:39.954
but l'm glad to be back
on Voyager.

42:42.026 --> 42:44.153
As am l.
