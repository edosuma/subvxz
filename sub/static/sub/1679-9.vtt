WEBVTT

00:01.814 --> 00:03.995
..learn about relationships
is that you're never done

00:04.005 --> 00:05.382
getting to know someone.

00:05.392 --> 00:07.133
Everyone has secrets.

00:07.143 --> 00:08.423
Some are nice.

00:08.433 --> 00:10.581
You know how to make crepes?

00:11.399 --> 00:13.072
That is so cool.

00:14.813 --> 00:16.675
Some aren't as nice.

00:16.685 --> 00:19.060
And then there was Derek,
and counting you,

00:19.070 --> 00:21.943
- that puts the total up to--
- Oh, I got your total.

00:22.407 --> 00:23.830
I've been counting along.

00:25.123 --> 00:27.631
And some are just weird.

00:27.647 --> 00:30.133
You're scared of
the seven dwarfs?

00:30.149 --> 00:31.782
Just Doc. He's creepy.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.650
I mean the guy went
to medical school.

00:33.666 --> 00:36.070
What's he doing living
with six coal miners?

00:36.286 --> 00:38.753
Oh, man! I'm so excited.
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:38.766 --> 00:40.672
- I bet you guys couldn't either.
- Why?

00:40.688 --> 00:42.631
Only the Gala event
for the Grand Opening

00:42.648 --> 00:45.493
of Sharper Image's 500th store.
Didn't you get my email?

00:45.508 --> 00:48.001
No, I blocked your address
after the fourth time

00:48.015 --> 00:51.450
you sent me the video of the
monkey sniffing his own butt.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.971
Come on! It's on me.
I'm buying three of you foot massagers

00:53.987 --> 00:56.570
and one of you a nose hair trimmer.
You know who you are.

00:56.887 --> 00:58.030
Come on, let's go.

00:58.046 --> 00:59.011
Okay, I'm in.

00:59.027 --> 01:01.320
- To the Willowbrook Mall!
- To the Willowbrook Mall.

01:01.335 --> 01:04.272
Oh, it's at a mall?
I'm not going.

01:04.288 --> 01:05.521
What? Why not?

01:05.538 --> 01:07.633
I just don't feel
like going to a mall.

01:07.645 --> 01:09.563
We can split a Cinnabon.

01:09.578 --> 01:11.370
No, I'm really not going to go.

01:11.388 --> 01:14.273
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- No, I don't go to malls!

01:15.816 --> 01:18.600
Sorry, I just don't like malls.

01:18.617 --> 01:20.242
Why not?

01:20.776 --> 01:22.672
I'd rather not say.

01:23.006 --> 01:24.821
- Sharper Images.
- But that's where clothes live.

01:24.855 --> 01:26.922
Guys, guys, guys,
Robin doesn't like malls.

01:26.936 --> 01:29.320
If she doesn't want to tell us why,
she doesn't have to.

01:29.337 --> 01:31.673
I think we should all
just respect her privacy.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.103
Thanks, Ted.

01:33.115 --> 01:35.353
So, what's the deal
with you and malls?

01:35.366 --> 01:37.163
I thought you said that,
if I didn't want to talk about it,

01:37.198 --> 01:38.310
I didn't have to.

01:38.326 --> 01:40.050
Yeah, with those people.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.940
But I'm your boyfriend.
Come on. What is it?

01:41.955 --> 01:43.052
Did you get arrested at a mall?

01:43.087 --> 01:43.702
No.

01:43.717 --> 01:45.520
- Dumped at a mall?
- Ted.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.632
Found out you were
Canadian at a mall?

01:47.645 --> 01:48.613
Let it go.

01:48.627 --> 01:50.321
Trapped under a fake
boulder at a mall?

01:50.335 --> 01:52.600
- Let it go.
- Mauled at the mall?

01:52.617 --> 01:54.001
Let it go!

01:54.896 --> 01:58.120
And who gets trapped under
a fake boulder at the mall?

01:59.095 --> 02:02.720
Not me in Ohio when I was nine,
that's for sure.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.126 --> 02:22.523
I don't get it. Why won't Robin
tell me why she hates malls?

02:22.536 --> 02:24.833
Ted, you should be happy
Robin has a secret.

02:24.847 --> 02:26.202
The more you learn
about a person,

02:26.217 --> 02:29.463
the better chance you have of
hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.

02:29.477 --> 02:30.590
The "Oh" moment?

02:30.608 --> 02:34.363
Yeah, that moment when you find
out that one detail about a person

02:34.378 --> 02:36.471
that is going to
be a deal breaker.

02:36.485 --> 02:38.122
It's a promise ring.

02:38.135 --> 02:41.651
I made a pact with God to stay
a virgin till I'm married.

02:44.008 --> 02:45.883
I don't have an
eating disorder.

02:45.898 --> 02:50.043
It's just when I put food in my mouth,
I chew it, and then I spit it out.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.550
I just turned 30.

02:55.868 --> 02:58.441
So trust me,
you want to postpone

02:58.458 --> 03:01.322
knowing anything about each
other for as long as possible.

03:01.338 --> 03:04.330
Mmm. I disagree.
If there is some potential "Oh" moment,

03:04.347 --> 03:07.150
I want to know about it right away.
I mean, what's the alternative?

03:07.226 --> 03:10.643
I now pronounce you,
man and wife.

03:12.995 --> 03:14.353
I love you.

03:14.388 --> 03:16.522
I used to be a dude.

03:18.238 --> 03:19.862
Yeah, I agree with Ted.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.821
In a real relationship,
you share everything.

03:22.838 --> 03:25.321
That's why Marshall and
I don't keep any secrets.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.721
You are such a cutie pie.
Here's a quarter.

03:27.735 --> 03:29.600
Go  play a song on the jukebox.

03:29.658 --> 03:31.882
No, it's true.
They tell each other everything.

03:31.897 --> 03:34.820
I can think of tons of things,
there's no way Marshall's told you.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.043
Try me.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.371
Do you know about the time
Marshall was in Trenton?

03:39.407 --> 03:41.051
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.

03:41.068 --> 03:42.662
Bill's bachelor
party in Memphis?

03:42.676 --> 03:45.620
Oh, when they had to pump out
all the nickels from his stomach?

03:45.638 --> 03:47.710
Wow. Okay. Seattle.

03:47.725 --> 03:50.553
Trick question. Marshall's never
been to the Pacific Northwest

03:50.566 --> 03:52.682
because he's afraid
of Sasquatch.

03:52.696 --> 03:53.952
Damn, you're good.

03:53.965 --> 03:57.502
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch,
I just think we should all be on alert.

03:58.217 --> 04:01.240
Trust me. Not only do they
tell each other everything,

04:01.256 --> 04:03.410
they want to know everything.

04:03.428 --> 04:05.630
So after the shower I was brushing
my teeth. And I was like,

04:05.668 --> 04:07.542
"Oh, man!
I wanted to have some orange juice.

04:07.557 --> 04:08.880
I should have done that first."

04:08.895 --> 04:10.550
But I already had the
toothpaste on the toothbrush.

04:10.586 --> 04:13.061
So I just went ahead
and brushed them anyway.

04:13.076 --> 04:15.220
What happened next?

04:17.346 --> 04:20.029
Yeah, meanwhile,
Robin tells me nothing.

04:20.075 --> 04:22.782
Fine. Do you want to know
what Robin's secret is?

04:22.797 --> 04:23.870
You know?

04:23.888 --> 04:25.342
Of course I know.

04:25.355 --> 04:27.271
She couldn't look at us,
her face got flushed--

04:27.287 --> 04:28.923
that's shame, my friend.

04:28.938 --> 04:33.720
Our friend Robin used to do porn,
wait for it...

04:33.827 --> 04:35.780
...ography.

04:35.878 --> 04:38.450
Yeah, we didn't really
need to wait for that.

04:38.468 --> 04:40.182
And it's ridiculous.

04:40.198 --> 04:41.702
I don't know.
He could be right.

04:41.718 --> 04:44.402
She does have the fake
orgasm noises down.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.193
Hey!

04:45.207 --> 04:46.802
What? The walls are thin.

04:46.815 --> 04:49.491
That's not what I'm
"hey"ing you about.

04:50.005 --> 04:51.502
You know what it might be?

04:51.515 --> 04:55.451
This is going to sound a little
crazy but what if Robin is married?

04:55.467 --> 04:58.101
Married? What does that
have to do with the mall?

04:58.118 --> 05:00.790
Well, maybe she got
married at the mall.

05:00.805 --> 05:02.492
Back home in Minnesota,
a ton of people get married

05:02.526 --> 05:04.560
at the Mall of America.
It's great.

05:04.578 --> 05:07.281
There's this gorgeous indoor 
golf course for pictures,

05:07.296 --> 05:09.790
numerous fine dining options,
and talk about a reasonable--

05:09.807 --> 05:12.853
- We are not getting married at the mall!
- Well, just meet with the guy.

05:12.925 --> 05:15.520
She's not married.
Robin hates marriage.

05:15.535 --> 05:17.952
Because she already
got married.

05:17.966 --> 05:19.681
At the mall.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.850
No,  because before Robin
moved to New York, she...

05:23.328 --> 05:24.820
What was she doing?

05:24.878 --> 05:27.002
Well, I don't know.
Whenever I ask her about Canada,

05:27.015 --> 05:29.202
she kind of clams up.

05:29.216 --> 05:31.060
She's  a pretty private person.

05:31.075 --> 05:33.943
Except when she's
talking about...

05:33.958 --> 05:36.500
Oh, a friend of mine in Canada
got married way too young

05:36.606 --> 05:39.032
and it really turned
her off to marriage.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.733
What do you think of
this wedding cake?

05:40.748 --> 05:42.240
Oh, I like it.

05:42.255 --> 05:43.762
Hey, you remember that
friend of mine in Canada

05:43.796 --> 05:45.403
who got married way too young?

05:45.416 --> 05:48.740
Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields'
giant cookie.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.323
No.

05:53.546 --> 05:56.233
My friend in Canada who
got married way too young,

05:56.246 --> 05:58.610
they had to do their vows twice,
once in French.

05:58.628 --> 06:00.200
They speak French there, too?

06:00.213 --> 06:02.191
God, that place is a mess.

06:03.207 --> 06:06.193
So you don't think there's
any "friend" from Canada?

06:06.209 --> 06:07.502
Oh, I'm sure there is.

06:07.519 --> 06:10.211
Just like I have a "friend" who
wet his bed till he was ten.

06:10.225 --> 06:11.923
Use your brain, Ted.

06:14.746 --> 06:16.732
Guys, there's no way
Robin is married.

06:16.745 --> 06:18.481
It's ludicrous to
even suggest it.

06:18.497 --> 06:20.740
- Thank you, Barney.
- 'Cause it's porn.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.411
I need another beer.

06:22.755 --> 06:25.711
Robin was not in porn.
I bet you anything that she's married.

06:25.725 --> 06:27.311
$20,000 says it's porn.

06:27.326 --> 06:28.653
I don't have $20,000.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.551
Well, then what do you have?

06:31.248 --> 06:33.120
- Well...
- No.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.573
I've got it.
The ultimate wager--

06:36.586 --> 06:37.862
slap bet.

06:37.876 --> 06:40.100
Oh, slap bet.
We used to do those when I was a kid.

06:40.117 --> 06:41.420
What the hell's a slap bet?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.413
Whoever is right gets to slap
the other person in the face

06:43.447 --> 06:45.701
as hard as they possibly can--
but no rings.

06:45.718 --> 06:48.391
Are you really going to do that?
That's so immature.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.112
- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.
- Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?

06:51.148 --> 06:54.183
Um, if a problem arises and we
need a ruling, that's your job.

06:54.195 --> 06:55.973
But you have to be unbiased

06:55.985 --> 06:59.232
and put the integrity of
slap bet above all else.

06:59.247 --> 07:01.973
This is an honor you will
take with you to your grave.

07:01.985 --> 07:03.713
On your tombstone,
it will read,

07:03.726 --> 07:07.050
"Lily Aldrin, caring wife,
loving friend,

07:07.066 --> 07:09.040
Slap Bet Commissioner."

07:09.616 --> 07:13.893
And your tombstone will read "Got
slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."

07:15.396 --> 07:19.410
Okay. What if I just ask Robin
point blank if she has a husband?

07:19.425 --> 07:21.521
You said you would
respect her privacy,

07:21.538 --> 07:23.710
so maybe you should
just drop it.

07:23.896 --> 07:25.592
Yeah, you're right.

07:27.498 --> 07:28.930
Husband.

07:30.496 --> 07:32.471
There's no "P" in husband.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.471
Wow, you seem to know
a lot about husbands.

07:35.925 --> 07:38.012
Fine. I'll take it back.

07:38.297 --> 07:41.072
Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands,
this is great, you're going to love this.

07:41.105 --> 07:43.703
Marshall, you know Marshall.
He thinks that the reason

07:43.716 --> 07:45.240
you didn't want to go to
the mall the other day

07:45.275 --> 07:49.370
is because you got married at a
mall and have a husband in Canada.

07:50.747 --> 07:53.140
I told him he's crazy.
Because he's crazy, right?

07:53.156 --> 07:55.581
I mean, how crazy is that?

07:55.908 --> 07:57.913
Are you asking me
if I'm married?

07:57.928 --> 07:59.192
Well, you can ask me.

07:59.207 --> 08:01.330
Nope, I'm not married.
Your turn.

08:01.345 --> 08:03.451
What happened to
respecting my privacy?

08:03.467 --> 08:06.122
Look, just say, "No,
I'm not married."

08:06.138 --> 08:07.953
Ted, I don't understand
why you can't--

08:07.967 --> 08:10.513
Just say, "No,
I'm not married."

08:10.527 --> 08:12.162
I can't.

08:12.318 --> 08:14.182
Marshall's right.

08:16.276 --> 08:18.980
I was young and I got married.

08:18.996 --> 08:20.962
It was a mistake and
he moved away, but...

08:20.976 --> 08:23.801
yeah. I'm married.

08:33.086 --> 08:34.751
You have a husband?

08:34.768 --> 08:36.692
I was young and stupid

08:36.707 --> 08:39.970
and we got married at a mall
and we broke up at a mall

08:39.986 --> 08:42.730
and I...
I haven't been to a mall since.

08:42.748 --> 08:44.101
Why didn't you get divorced?

08:44.115 --> 08:46.573
He moved to Hong Kong for
work and I was like...

08:46.586 --> 08:47.991
eh, good enough.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.211
Good enough?
That's not good enough.

08:50.226 --> 08:53.321
You  order pancakes, you get waffles,
that's good enough.

08:53.337 --> 08:56.523
Look, I haven't
seen him in years.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.380
It's just a part of my
life I want to forget.

08:59.808 --> 09:02.682
Just please don't tell
anyone about this.

09:03.735 --> 09:05.392
Okay.

09:08.508 --> 09:10.942
Dude, your hand is monstrous.

09:10.955 --> 09:13.660
Yeah, well, what'd you expect?
You've seen my penis.

09:15.198 --> 09:17.933
I can't believe you
told us Robin's secret.

09:17.946 --> 09:20.510
What? How could I keep
something like that to myself?

09:20.527 --> 09:21.871
And you begged me to tell you.

09:21.888 --> 09:23.330
No, I didn't.

09:23.778 --> 09:26.380
Please tell us. Just tell us.
I'm begging you.

09:26.395 --> 09:28.593
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
Please please please--

09:28.607 --> 09:31.090
Fine. Robin's married.

09:33.015 --> 09:35.181
Yeah, well,
you still shouldn't have told us.

09:35.196 --> 09:37.102
I mean,
what kind of boyfriend are you?

09:37.117 --> 09:39.122
See that's just it,
I'm not the boyfriend.

09:39.136 --> 09:40.543
I'm the mistress.

09:40.555 --> 09:41.993
No, not the mistress.

09:42.006 --> 09:43.490
The mastress.

09:43.506 --> 09:45.040
The master.
What do you call it?

09:45.057 --> 09:47.150
Uh, pretty sure we're
going to call it mistress.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.351
What am I going to do?
My girlfriend's married.

09:51.365 --> 09:52.903
Do I ask her to get a divorce?

09:52.918 --> 09:56.081
Ted, even if she is married,
it's a Canadian marriage.

09:56.098 --> 09:58.151
It's like their money,
or their army.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.210
Nobody takes it seriously.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.411
It's serious to me.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.322
You know what, in some countries,
if you been separated

10:03.357 --> 10:06.073
for longer than five years,
technically, you're no longer married.

10:06.085 --> 10:08.632
I can check it out at the
law library at school.

10:10.758 --> 10:13.560
I can see my hand
print on your face.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.291
Don't get too cocky, Slappy.

10:16.306 --> 10:19.363
I just got a shipment of porn
from Canada I have to go through.

10:19.376 --> 10:21.372
I won the bet.
Why are you still searching?

10:21.387 --> 10:23.181
Just because you were right
doesn't mean I'm wrong.

10:23.215 --> 10:26.542
Oh, right, like you need 
an excuse to watch porn.

10:26.587 --> 10:28.791
Canadian porn.

10:28.808 --> 10:31.340
Trust me when I tell you their
universal health care system

10:31.355 --> 10:33.792
doesn't cover breast implants.

10:33.877 --> 10:36.793
If I have to sit through one
more flat-chested Nova Scotian

10:36.807 --> 10:39.080
riding a Mountie on
the back of a Zamboni

10:39.096 --> 10:41.560
I'll go out of my mind.

10:44.617 --> 10:46.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:46.608 --> 10:48.551
Listen, dude,
I got to talk to you,

10:48.568 --> 10:51.722
but you got to promise me
that you won't tell Barney.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.241
Fine, I won't tell Barney.
What is it?

10:55.516 --> 10:58.001
- Robin's not married.
- What?

10:58.017 --> 10:59.500
Why would she tell me she was?

10:59.518 --> 11:01.660
I don't know, but I cross-
checked every record in Canada.

11:01.696 --> 11:03.552
There's no record of
her ever being married.

11:03.567 --> 11:04.692
There must be some mistake.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.510
I promise you.
She's not married.

11:06.527 --> 11:08.872
She's not great at
parking legally either.

11:09.318 --> 11:12.740
So she lied to me?
W--What am I going to do?

11:12.757 --> 11:15.780
I-I can't confront her,
'cause then she'll know I told you.

11:16.416 --> 11:18.072
You got to lawyer her. 

11:18.085 --> 11:20.631
You got to ask her a bunch of questions,
try to trip her up,

11:20.647 --> 11:22.223
maybe make her feel guilty,
whatever it takes

11:22.258 --> 11:24.063
to get a confession out of her.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.402
Thanks for telling
me your secret.

11:27.416 --> 11:29.871
It means so much to me,
that you could be so--

11:29.886 --> 11:31.723
God, what's the word
I'm looking for?

11:31.808 --> 11:32.881
Honest.

11:32.898 --> 11:34.682
Mm, thanks, Ted.

11:34.697 --> 11:36.832
Yeah.  You know what's probably
the best part about your honesty?

11:36.865 --> 11:38.703
How truthful it is.

11:39.037 --> 11:40.821
I say we just move on.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.973
Well, for me to get total
closure on this whole

11:43.988 --> 11:46.192
"my girlfriend has
a husband" thing,

11:46.297 --> 11:47.951
I think I might need a
little bit more information,

11:47.988 --> 11:49.892
like what month did
you get married?

11:49.905 --> 11:51.740
June. We had a June wedding.

11:51.758 --> 11:54.100
Ah, Canada in June.

11:54.117 --> 11:55.931
That's the dream.

11:56.876 --> 11:58.772
Sit-down or buffet?

11:59.418 --> 12:02.551
Well, it's...
weird that you don't remember.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.731
No, I just didn't
know how to answer

12:04.746 --> 12:07.691
because we did butlered hors
d'oeuvres in the atrium,

12:07.707 --> 12:10.733
but the actual dinner was
a buffet in the Food Court

12:10.747 --> 12:14.132
featuring a filet mignon or a
roasted potato-crusted salmon

12:14.148 --> 12:16.872
with a lobster
scallion beurre blanc.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.352
Band or DJ?

12:21.365 --> 12:23.531
A string quartet played
at the ceremony,

12:23.548 --> 12:26.542
but for the actual reception,
we had a seven-piece band.

12:26.558 --> 12:28.300
We paid extra for the sax

12:28.315 --> 12:31.851
'cause I just love that
smooth alto sound.

12:31.865 --> 12:33.540
- How many bridesmaids?
- Seven.

12:33.557 --> 12:34.861
- Flowers?
- Azaleas.

12:34.878 --> 12:37.160
- Color scheme?
- Dusty rose and sienna.

12:37.175 --> 12:38.961
Husband's name.

12:41.415 --> 12:43.203
- You were never married!
- Yes, I was.

12:43.216 --> 12:45.142
- No, you weren't.
- How do you know?

12:45.158 --> 12:46.543
I looked it up at the library.

12:46.555 --> 12:50.133
- What library?
- The one on Fifth.

12:50.148 --> 12:52.051
- When did you go?
- Today at lunch,

12:52.068 --> 12:54.100
and I had an apple brie
panini with potato salad...

12:54.116 --> 12:56.343
I'm not questioning
the lunch part, Ted.

12:56.357 --> 12:57.950
What database did you use?

12:57.967 --> 13:02.690
I used the Canadian
Mall Marriage 6000.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.571
Fine, Marshall looked
it up at school.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.720
- You told Marshall?!
- You lied to me!

13:07.735 --> 13:09.630
See, this is why I don't
tell people secrets.

13:09.645 --> 13:12.190
You were supposed to be the
one person I trusted the most

13:12.205 --> 13:13.872
and even you couldn't
keep a secret.

13:13.886 --> 13:15.200
But it was a fake secret.

13:15.217 --> 13:17.483
Yeah, I was testing
you and you failed.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.871
And now you're never gonna know
why I don't go to the mall.

13:19.885 --> 13:21.891
And it's good, too.

13:21.906 --> 13:23.792
You were testing me?
That's insane.

13:23.807 --> 13:26.571
Oh, yeah? How long did it
take for you to tell Marshall

13:26.586 --> 13:29.423
my biggest secret in the world?
Five minutes?

13:29.438 --> 13:32.293
- That wasn't a real secret!
- Yeah, but it could have been.

13:32.308 --> 13:33.653
You are driving me crazy!

13:33.665 --> 13:35.572
No wonder your fake
husband moved to Hong Kong.

13:35.587 --> 13:37.843
He moved there for business.

13:39.446 --> 13:40.582
You.

13:40.597 --> 13:42.333
You got something to say to me?

13:42.567 --> 13:44.153
What are you talking about?

13:44.168 --> 13:47.193
I know Robin was
never really married.

13:47.405 --> 13:50.122
How could you
possibly know that?

13:53.897 --> 13:57.380
And then I put on my
pajamas and got into bed.

13:57.415 --> 13:58.991
How about you?

13:59.228 --> 14:02.343
Oh, let's see, uh,
first I took the subway to school.

14:02.357 --> 14:03.642
Then I got a bagel.

14:03.656 --> 14:06.010
Then I went to the library and
found out Robin was never married.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.141
Crazy.

14:07.155 --> 14:09.251
Then I was hungry again,
so I went down to the vending machine,

14:09.286 --> 14:12.422
but by the time I got down there,
I wasn't even hungry anymore.

14:13.705 --> 14:15.802
- You told him?
- I had to.

14:15.817 --> 14:18.150
I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.

14:18.166 --> 14:21.261
Believe me, this hurts me more
than it's gonna hurt you.

14:21.275 --> 14:24.191
Don't count on it.
I've been practicing on a tree trunk.

14:24.888 --> 14:27.713
- Barney gets three slaps.
- Three?

14:27.725 --> 14:31.773
One because you lied and two
for being prematurely slapped.

14:31.786 --> 14:32.911
Three slaps.

14:32.926 --> 14:34.012
But--

14:38.056 --> 14:39.922
Oh, my God.

14:39.938 --> 14:42.463
- Are you gonna cry?
- No.

14:42.558 --> 14:44.471
You're gonna cry.

14:46.516 --> 14:49.831
I just don't think it's healthy to
keep big secrets in a relationship.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.751
My parents didn't really talk
to each other for 30 years

14:51.788 --> 14:52.861
and now they're divorced.

14:52.877 --> 14:54.671
I have shared more
of myself with you

14:54.688 --> 14:56.780
than I've ever
shared with anyone.

14:56.797 --> 14:58.933
I'm asking for this one secret,

14:58.946 --> 15:02.710
which has nothing to do with us,
to just be mine.

15:04.808 --> 15:07.382
So I just got a very
interesting phone call.

15:07.397 --> 15:08.810
What are you talking about?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.600
I know Robin's secret.

15:10.616 --> 15:12.232
- What?
- That's right.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.002
I know your secret, Robin.

15:14.015 --> 15:17.811
Or should I say Robin Sparkles?

15:18.166 --> 15:19.732
How do you know that name?

15:19.745 --> 15:21.623
Because I know the truth,

15:21.635 --> 15:24.210
and I am about to show
it to you right now.

15:24.228 --> 15:25.921
Gather 'round, Ted,
you're gonna want to see this.

15:25.957 --> 15:27.383
Yeah, no, I don't.

15:27.395 --> 15:28.311
What?

15:28.325 --> 15:30.840
Robin wants to keep
this a secret, so...

15:30.855 --> 15:32.621
it's gonna stay a secret.

15:32.867 --> 15:35.401
Yeah, it's not
gonna stay a secret.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.780
You see, in my research,

15:36.798 --> 15:39.171
I came upon a certain
gentleman in Malaysia

15:39.188 --> 15:41.950
who is in possession of
a certain videotape.

15:41.966 --> 15:44.240
He just emailed me that
it will be up and running

15:44.258 --> 15:47.760
on My Space in about...
right now.

15:48.757 --> 15:52.440
Robin's world is about to
be turned upside-down.

15:52.455 --> 15:53.960
I mean, I'm guessing.

15:53.976 --> 15:55.112
Barney, don't, okay?

15:55.128 --> 15:57.211
Robin, please don't panic.

15:57.226 --> 15:59.240
I'm only gonna show enough to
prove to Marshall I was right.

15:59.277 --> 16:01.502
No, Barney,
I said we're not watching this.

16:01.516 --> 16:03.300
No, it's time.

16:03.405 --> 16:05.163
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

16:05.177 --> 16:08.581
but if it's out there, there's no
point in trying to hide it anymore.

16:09.056 --> 16:11.371
Let's just watch it 
and be done with it.

16:11.507 --> 16:13.702
Are you as terrified as I am?

16:14.068 --> 16:16.612
I don't want to
get slapped again.

16:18.815 --> 16:21.540
I want to stress
that I was young.

16:21.558 --> 16:22.750
Yeah, you were.

16:22.768 --> 16:24.121
And I didn't know any better.

16:24.135 --> 16:25.681
They never do.

16:25.696 --> 16:28.343
And it started out as an
innocent modeling job.

16:28.358 --> 16:30.373
It  always does.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.143
Please, Mr. Johnson.

16:33.157 --> 16:35.523
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.

16:35.537 --> 16:38.191
Please don't give me detention.

16:38.538 --> 16:43.131
Isn't there something I can
do to make it up to you?

16:46.607 --> 16:48.620
Oh, my God.

16:48.638 --> 16:50.633
Well, obviously,
I've been proven right,

16:50.647 --> 16:52.693
so in the interest
of Robin's dignity,

16:52.706 --> 16:53.963
I won't show anymore.

16:53.977 --> 16:56.771
Plus, it's getting late.
It's already slap o'clock.

16:58.205 --> 16:59.773
What the hell was that?

16:59.788 --> 17:02.510
Uh, I slap bet Marshall that
you did porn, so I win.

17:02.525 --> 17:06.470
Porn? I wish it was porn.
It would be less embarrassing.

17:07.588 --> 17:09.040
I know.

17:09.058 --> 17:12.692
How about I sing you a song?

17:18.896 --> 17:21.871
Let's go to the
mall, everybody!

17:27.755 --> 17:31.143
I was a teenage
pop star in Canada.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.750
# Put on your jelly bracelets #

17:33.765 --> 17:35.803
# And your cool graffiti coat #

17:35.816 --> 17:37.442
# At the mall, having fun #

17:37.458 --> 17:40.503
# Is what it's all about #

17:40.518 --> 17:43.840
This is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.750
- That's you?
- Yes.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.602
I had one minor hit.

17:47.618 --> 17:51.623
I had to go all over Canada
and sing this song in malls.

17:51.636 --> 17:55.793
For a whole year, I lived off of
Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.

17:55.806 --> 17:59.442
# Everybody come and play #

17:59.457 --> 18:03.640
# Throw every last care away #

18:03.656 --> 18:06.923
# Let's go to the mall #

18:06.938 --> 18:08.921
# Today #

18:09.598 --> 18:13.031
If this is the '90s,
why does it look like 1986?

18:13.045 --> 18:16.780
The '80s didn't come to Canada till,
like, '93.

18:17.506 --> 18:21.632
Taking a break from the first of many,
many viewings,

18:21.645 --> 18:24.202
I can't help but notice
that this isn't porn.

18:24.217 --> 18:27.012
And yet,
a slap occurred without the permission

18:27.025 --> 18:29.053
of the Slap Bet Commissioner.

18:29.068 --> 18:32.742
Looks like somebody suffered
from premature slapulation.

18:32.775 --> 18:34.263
Oh, my God, Robin's rapping.

18:34.277 --> 18:35.580
Guys, Robin's rapping.

18:35.598 --> 18:37.442
# Went to the mall with #
# a couple of friends #

18:37.456 --> 18:39.783
# I had a whole week's #
# allowance to spend #

18:39.997 --> 18:42.061
Okay, I'm going to
give you a choice.

18:42.076 --> 18:44.700
Either ten slaps
right now in a row,

18:44.717 --> 18:47.240
or five slaps that
can be doled out

18:47.257 --> 18:50.803
at any point from
here to eternity.

18:50.877 --> 18:52.230
You go with the ten now.

18:52.248 --> 18:54.210
No way,
why get ten when you can get five?

18:54.227 --> 18:56.242
Yeah, but the constant fear of
knowing that at any moment,

18:56.276 --> 18:58.002
you could get slapped in the face,
would drive you crazy.

18:58.038 --> 18:59.651
I'm going to go with
the five for eternity.

18:59.687 --> 19:02.271
- Good call.
- Horrible call.

19:03.865 --> 19:06.202
Relax, dude,
I'm just going for my soda, man.

19:06.215 --> 19:07.092
Take it easy.

19:07.108 --> 19:09.030
This is going to be fun.

19:10.706 --> 19:12.083
# Let's go to the mall #

19:12.188 --> 19:14.783
# Let's go to the mall #

19:14.796 --> 19:16.482
# Today #

19:16.636 --> 19:18.671
So just to be clear,

19:18.685 --> 19:22.770
you wanted everybody to
go to the mall today?

19:24.078 --> 19:26.763
Wow, we're going to
watch this a lot.

19:26.786 --> 19:30.090
I can't believe I ever wore
a Bedazzled jean jacket.

19:30.216 --> 19:31.712
Hey, just so you know,

19:31.728 --> 19:34.413
16-year-old me would
have been all over you.

19:34.428 --> 19:37.583
You could have been the girlfriend
in Canada I told everyone I had.

19:37.666 --> 19:40.410
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry
I pried this out of you.

19:40.427 --> 19:42.330
I probably should
have left it alone.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.293
You know what?

19:44.305 --> 19:46.113
You know me better now.

19:46.876 --> 19:48.771
That feels kind of nice.

19:55.196 --> 19:56.913
That's one.

20:01.108 --> 20:05.021
# Everybody come and play #

20:05.037 --> 20:08.591
# Throw every last care away #

20:08.605 --> 20:09.473
Wow.

20:09.487 --> 20:12.412
# Let's go to the mall #

20:12.427 --> 20:14.182
# Today #

20:14.195 --> 20:15.821
Did you have to laugh
like that every time?

20:15.855 --> 20:17.212
Yes.

20:17.576 --> 20:19.520
# This boy I like #

20:19.535 --> 20:21.352
# Met him at the food court #

20:21.368 --> 20:22.853
# He's got hair like Gretzky #

20:22.868 --> 20:25.403
# And he does jumps #
# on his skateboard #

20:25.417 --> 20:27.512
# I hope he asks me out #

20:27.527 --> 20:29.392
# Take me to my favorite spot #

20:29.408 --> 20:31.033
# It'll be just him and me #

20:31.045 --> 20:34.151
# But don't forget the robot #

20:34.247 --> 20:36.563
The robot. Hey!

20:37.898 --> 20:40.610
# But, baby #
# I don't want to wait #

20:40.626 --> 20:41.350
# Let's do it #

20:41.366 --> 20:42.942
No, she doesn't want to wait.

20:42.957 --> 20:44.891
# I'm gonna rock #
# your body anyway #

20:44.907 --> 20:47.542
# I'm gonna rock your #
# body till Canada Day #

20:49.038 --> 20:53.013
# Everybody come and play #

20:53.025 --> 20:56.850
