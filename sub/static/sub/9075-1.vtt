01:57.618 --> 02:00.371
<i>The last full moon of that spring...</i>

02:00.454 --> 02:05.000
<i>came a little more than a month before
school let out for summer vacation.</i>

02:11.090 --> 02:16.053
<i>Our town's long nightmare began that night.</i>

02:18.430 --> 02:22.935
<i>My beer is Rheingold, the dry beer</i>

02:23.018 --> 02:27.523
<i>Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer</i>

02:27.606 --> 02:32.903
<i>It's not bitter, not sweet,
it's a real frosty treat</i>

02:32.987 --> 02:37.408
<i>Won't you buy, won't you buy...</i>

02:40.619 --> 02:44.248
<i>Won't you try, won't you
buy, Rheingold Beer.</i>

02:58.179 --> 03:02.474
Jesus, Arnie,
are you afraid of the boogeyman?

03:04.727 --> 03:08.814
God... Come on outta there, Buster,
and give me a hand.

03:10.691 --> 03:15.362
All right. What is it that you want, Arnie?

03:15.446 --> 03:17.698
I want some Rheingold.

03:17.781 --> 03:23.746
And what're you gonna do...
Soon as I get that dirt outta there...

03:40.387 --> 03:43.098
Rheingold time, Arnie!

03:48.604 --> 03:50.648
Oh, shit!

04:00.407 --> 04:04.745
<i>The killing had begun.
But at first no one knew it.</i>

04:05.621 --> 04:08.457
<i>You see, Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk.</i>

04:08.540 --> 04:11.335
<i>And what happened seemed like an accident.</i>

04:11.418 --> 04:15.297
<i>The county coroner concluded
that Arnie had passed out on the tracks.</i>

04:15.381 --> 04:18.425
<i>There wasn't enough evidence
to conclude anything else.</i>

04:20.803 --> 04:24.139
- Yeah!
- Did you remember the deviled-ham?

04:27.977 --> 04:30.354
It's such a wonderful day!

04:30.437 --> 04:33.607
<i>This is Tarker's Mills, where I grew up.</i>

04:33.691 --> 04:35.651
<i>And this is how it looked that spring.</i>

04:35.734 --> 04:40.155
<i>A town where people cared about each other
as much as they cared about themselves.</i>

04:50.874 --> 04:54.503
<i>I was nearly 15 years old
and my brother Marty was 11.</i>

04:55.212 --> 04:57.881
We'd like to get things started now.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.013
May I have your attention
please, everybody?

05:04.096 --> 05:07.266
We'd like to get things started now,
if we could.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.645
A lotta chairs down here.
Come on right down and sit down.

05:11.729 --> 05:18.277
Alright, without further ado, I'd like
to turn things over to Reverend Lowe.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.283
I'm gonna go, okay?

05:24.366 --> 05:27.828
- Alright, but stay close.
- Thank you, folks.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.874
- Now, last June the...
- And make sure your brother's okay.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.418
"Make sure your brother's okay."

05:35.836 --> 05:37.379
Marty's a booger.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.383
- Wow!
- <i>Marty was the cross I had to bear.</i>

05:41.467 --> 05:42.843
Isn't that a garter snake?

05:42.926 --> 05:45.721
- Hell, no.
- <i>He wasn't so bad, actually.</i>

05:45.804 --> 05:47.014
Lemme hold him.

05:47.097 --> 05:51.185
<i>He was just constantly
thrown in my face by my parents.</i>

05:52.019 --> 05:54.355
- I have an idea.
- What?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.860
Oh, you wouldn't.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.363
Oh, you would.

06:02.446 --> 06:07.618
- Only let's not go bananas or anything.
- Who, me?

06:08.786 --> 06:13.415
An endeavor like this seems to me to be
the very definition of "community".

06:13.499 --> 06:15.209
Marty?

06:18.420 --> 06:19.963
Marty?

06:27.012 --> 06:30.307
- Aww, Janie!
- Goddammit!

06:33.685 --> 06:36.188
Come on, Jane, it was just a garden snake.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.899
Look at my hose!

06:38.982 --> 06:40.943
Oh, I hate you!

06:41.026 --> 06:43.529
Jane, I'm shocked at you!

06:45.114 --> 06:47.032
Stop it, Brady.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.788
Look alive!

06:56.458 --> 06:58.836
Hey, Jane, did you wet your pants?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.295
Jane, I'm sorry.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.339
Oh, yeah, sure.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.633
- I didn't mean to.
- Oh, no...!

07:04.716 --> 07:08.929
You never mean to! I hate you, you booger!

07:10.347 --> 07:11.598
I hate you!

07:11.682 --> 07:14.685
Well, sure looks like we got
her goat this time, didn't we?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.814
Shut up, Brady! You're warped.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.164
Come here, for a minute,
I have to talk to you.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.000
Listen, I told you, it ain't my baby.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.877
- Don't you ever drag me off like that!
- I can't believe you'd say that.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.086
You know it's your baby.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.672
- We've had this conversation before.
- You know I wasn't with anybody else.

07:43.755 --> 07:44.882
I need help!

07:44.965 --> 07:48.302
It's your oven.
But it ain't my bun you're baking!

07:48.385 --> 07:50.929
- I have to have some help!
- Remember the good times.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.431
You know, what I mean?

07:58.353 --> 08:02.691
I want you two to bury the hatchet.
You're being very silly, Jane.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.486
Did you see my knee? Did you see my outfit?

08:05.569 --> 08:07.654
Marty has apologized.

08:07.738 --> 08:11.617
And you know he couldn't have
climbed the tree to stop Brady anyway.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.869
You always take his side
because he's crippled.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.621
Well, it's not my fault he's crippled!

08:15.704 --> 08:19.833
You just wanna be quiet or
I'm gonna smack you now, I mean it!

08:19.917 --> 08:23.045
Come on, Jane, I'm sorry.
Brady wouldn't stop.

08:57.621 --> 09:01.583
Hey, pumpkin,
don't forget to help your brother.

09:12.135 --> 09:16.223
- Bob, I don't have my keys.
- Just a minute, sweetheart.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.976
Don't sweat the small stuff, Janie.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.271
Honey, where do you want this?

09:22.354 --> 09:25.190
Come on. Hurry up.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.119
Is Uncle Red still coming to visit?

09:37.828 --> 09:41.248
Mom told dad that Uncle Red's
getting a divorce. Another divorce.

09:41.331 --> 09:45.168
And she said he was drunk. Now that's
your great uncle. A chronic drunk!

09:45.252 --> 09:47.921
- He is not!
- He is so!

10:04.396 --> 10:05.731
Janie?

10:06.815 --> 10:08.650
Janie, you awake?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.510
What's the money for?

10:35.594 --> 10:37.804
A new pair of panty hose.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.473
Is it enough?

10:46.355 --> 10:51.276
Jane, please take the money.
It was Brady's idea. Honest to God.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.570
I wanna make up.

10:54.279 --> 10:58.617
I can get a pair of L'eggs down at the
pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.287
Here.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.004
Is it true what you said about Uncle Red?

11:11.088 --> 11:12.088
Yeah.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.843
I'm sorry I told you the way I did.
It was mean.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.720
It's okay.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.432
I never did much like Sheila anyway.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.061
Maybe I'll like the next one better.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.442
Suicides go to hell.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.278
Especially if they're pregnant.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.821
And I don't even care.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.987
It's not a normal situation down here.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.782
Well, that's what you told me this morning.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.786
Well, I'm happy to hear that.
You think it'll be sometime this week?

13:47.869 --> 13:50.497
Well, that's good. When and how many?

13:51.581 --> 13:53.250
Hey, fuck off!

13:54.751 --> 13:56.378
What'd he say, Joe?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.756
He said they'd be here by noon.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.717
Maybe it wasn't a good idea...

14:02.801 --> 14:06.888
telling that Smokey Bear
from the detective division to fuck off.

14:06.972 --> 14:10.141
Well, I waited till he hung up.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.395
Jesus Christ, what a mess.

14:13.478 --> 14:17.023
Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass
if somebody rammed it full of radium...

14:17.107 --> 14:19.401
- and gave him a Geiger counter.
- Could be.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.862
I know a fella who's still P.O.'d...

14:21.945 --> 14:24.990
about being fined a couple hundred bucks
for that little, uh...

14:25.073 --> 14:29.286
fender bender he had
back on the Ridge Road last year.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.414
Well, could be I know a fat ol' fella...

14:32.497 --> 14:37.252
who oughta take care of his mouth
before someone turns it inside out.

14:43.717 --> 14:47.304
We pay our taxes to keep this town safe.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.848
And Joe Haller ain't doin' it.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.977
Last town report said
you were in arrears in your taxes, Andy.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.605
Guess you caught up, huh?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.444
Whatta you, tryin' to be smart?

15:03.194 --> 15:08.491
Now you boys better turn down your
thermostats or you can both get out!

15:08.575 --> 15:10.368
You got me?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.370
Now, who's drinkin'?

15:15.123 --> 15:18.585
- Have a wonderful summer.
- Yes, yourself.

15:18.668 --> 15:22.422
Hey, it's Madman Marty
in the Silver Bullet.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.383
So, Marty, are you allowed
to be out of jail?

15:25.467 --> 15:28.261
- No, I like school.
- Poor guy.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.972
Be careful.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.394
Not bad, huh?

15:36.478 --> 15:39.606
Uncle Red changed the regular muffler
for a cherry bomb.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.775
- What's that?
- Glasspack!

15:41.858 --> 15:45.320
He said he's making me a new wheelchair.
A custom job.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.613
But now I dunno.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.366
He's getting divorced
and he's in the dog house with my mom.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.869
- For getting a divorce?
- Well, it is his third.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.511
Come on, Tammy.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.352
Thanks for coming home with me, Marty.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.146
I was scared to pass her house alone.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.941
Yeah, it is a little scary.

16:24.609 --> 16:28.571
I mean, I saw her all the time.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.783
Hey, take it easy.

16:31.866 --> 16:36.121
- I know how you feel.
- There's something else scary.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.666
What?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.418
That.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.586
I've been hearing noises out there.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.464
Tammy!

16:48.133 --> 16:50.927
Tammy, get on in here!
Help your mama with the laundry.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.179
Well, I would go take a look myself...

16:53.263 --> 16:56.933
but I think the Bullet'd get stuck.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.354
You would, wouldn't you?

17:02.355 --> 17:05.233
Yeah, sure. No sweat.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.316
Tammy!

17:06.984 --> 17:08.153
I gotta go, Tammy.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.156
Thanks again for coming home with me.

17:15.117 --> 17:19.539
Damn cripples! Always end up on welfare!

17:23.626 --> 17:28.339
I'd electrocute 'em all.
Balance the Goddamn budget!

17:31.509 --> 17:32.844
Oh, come on, baby.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.615
- Hey, Mr. Cutts.
- Well, Marty...

17:53.698 --> 17:56.284
I see you lucked out again.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.745
Yep. Would you fill her up, please?

17:59.454 --> 18:01.081
Want me to check the oil?

18:02.707 --> 18:03.583
Yeah, sure.

18:03.666 --> 18:08.129
Wipe the windshield,
check the driver's bullshit level?

18:13.301 --> 18:14.969
There was a guy sitting in a bar.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.763
"Bartender.", he says,
"Hey, jackass, gimme a drink".

18:16.846 --> 18:18.556
So the bartender pours a drink.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.559
And he drinks it. He sits for a while,
then says, "Jackass, pour me another."

18:21.643 --> 18:22.769
Se he pours another.

18:22.852 --> 18:27.357
This other guys asks the bartender,
"Why do you let him call you jackass?"

18:27.440 --> 18:31.569
The bartender says:
"Hee-aw, hee-aw, he always calls me that."

18:35.031 --> 18:36.324
- It's good isn't it?
- Yeah.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.745
You might as well fold, because you
don't stand a Chinaman's chance.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.288
Yeah...

18:42.372 --> 18:46.251
Uh, I'll see ya, and I'll raise you this.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.669
You can't bet managers.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.963
- You can't bet managers.
- Okay, okay.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.049
- I always said you can't bet managers.
- So I'll bet a Yankee.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.010
Piss on the Yankees, piss on the Indians...

18:56.094 --> 18:58.304
- Time for bed.
- Piss on...

18:58.388 --> 18:59.681
Mom, come on.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.977
Whoa, Nan. Let him finish the game.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.395
Okay?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.522
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

19:09.149 --> 19:12.527
What did you say, "Yankee"?
See your Yankee.

19:12.610 --> 19:16.072
And I'll call ya. I got three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.243
I got a straight to the Queen.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.955
That's bullshit luck! Bullshit luck!

19:24.038 --> 19:26.916
- That's enough! That's enough!
- I'm thinkin'...

19:27.458 --> 19:31.087
Hey, hold it!
Can I say, can I at least say good night?

19:32.547 --> 19:34.090
Good night.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.803
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.430
- See you later.
- Okay.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.140
- See you in the morning. Wake me up.
- Okay.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.308
- No, I'll wake you up.
- Okay.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.726
Okay.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.528
Honey, ask your sister to help you.
I'll be up in a minute.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.322
I will.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.283
Good night.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.189
I don't want you drinking around Marty.

20:31.272 --> 20:34.943
Don't be tellin' me what to do!
You've told me what to do all my life.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.028
Red, I don't care how you live...

20:37.111 --> 20:40.323
but he is a very
impressionable little boy.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.659
You know,
you think your only responsibility...

20:42.742 --> 20:46.663
is gettin' his butt outta the chair
and into the tub or the toilet.

20:46.746 --> 20:51.000
You oughta realize there's more to Marty
than him not being able to walk.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.463
- It's so easy for you, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is!

20:55.546 --> 20:59.634
You blow in here once a month and you
tell a few jokes and have a few beers...

20:59.717 --> 21:03.137
and then you wanna lecture me
about how to raise my son!

21:03.221 --> 21:07.267
I am the one who's responsible for
how he feels when you're like this.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.436
And for how he feels when you leave.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.980
Red...

21:12.981 --> 21:15.149
Marty has enough strikes
against him as it is.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.734
He doesn't have any strikes!

21:16.818 --> 21:19.737
I'm scared that one day he'll quit!

21:19.821 --> 21:20.863
He's not gonna give up!

21:20.947 --> 21:24.325
What he doesn't need is
you showin' him how!

21:33.459 --> 21:35.586
Another wonderful night
here at Sister Nan's.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.380
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

21:37.463 --> 21:39.340
<i>to the very best
of professional wrestling:</i>

21:39.424 --> 21:42.510
<i>World Wide Wrestling.
And John, we got a very exciting match.</i>

21:42.593 --> 21:44.721
<i>We have one of the young lions in there...</i>

21:44.804 --> 21:49.392
Come on, Rebel!
We're gonna bust him up tonight!

21:49.475 --> 21:54.731
We're gonna kick some ass!
We're gonna kick some ass!

22:01.904 --> 22:05.742
Bust him up! Bust his chops!

22:11.706 --> 22:15.168
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, Rebel, airplane!

22:15.251 --> 22:18.755
Ooooh, that's it! Oh, that hurts my parts!

22:24.635 --> 22:26.554
Goddamn...

22:30.058 --> 22:32.894
I'm just gonna have to do
somethin' about this.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.903
Let's see if you wanna
come back and bust up my pots...

22:41.986 --> 22:45.740
after I put rock salt up your ass!

22:49.702 --> 22:53.748
Come around bust up my pots,
I'm gonna bust up your ass!

22:53.831 --> 22:55.917
Sons-o'-bitches!

22:57.835 --> 23:04.258
I hope you're in there cause
I'm gonna blow your ass off with this salt!

23:33.996 --> 23:35.665
Shit!

25:31.239 --> 25:34.200
Ain't that a hell of a note!

25:36.661 --> 25:38.371
Isn't that something?

25:38.454 --> 25:43.960
<i>Observe Sheriff Haller's curfew,
after 5 p.m., please stay indoors.</i>

25:44.043 --> 25:45.753
Haller!

25:47.630 --> 25:52.677
- Well, you got any leads?
- I'm working on it, Mayor.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.556
Mr. Mayor.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.897
David!

26:07.275 --> 26:08.985
Mommy wants you to get inside.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.601
- Brady, I got it.
- Great!

26:41.684 --> 26:43.853
Marty Coslaw, you get outta that tree!

26:43.936 --> 26:46.522
Supper was ready an hour ago, dumbo.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.775
Oh, Jeez, I forgot. Is she mad?

26:49.859 --> 26:53.321
Yeah. At me for not finding you sooner!

27:00.202 --> 27:04.457
- Help me with the Bullet, please.
- I oughta let you fall.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.909
Hey, Brady, you comin'?

27:39.992 --> 27:42.078
In a while!

27:43.204 --> 27:44.413
Come on, Marty.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.251
Marty, it's getting late.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.356
And we oughta make Joe Haller,
uh, dog catcher.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.359
- You know, nothing big, just for poodles...
- Andy, lighten up!

28:13.442 --> 28:15.027
Let Joe handle the investigation.

28:15.111 --> 28:16.862
- Investigation?
- Yeah.

28:16.946 --> 28:22.201
This investigation is as efficient
as a submarine with screen doors.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.371
I've heard enough outta you, Andy Fairton.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.457
- Come on, Pete, it's not worth it!
- Let him go!

28:28.999 --> 28:33.295
If you don't shut your mouth,
I'm gonna shut it for you!

28:34.588 --> 28:36.465
What'd you say?

28:36.549 --> 28:40.177
You heard what I said, Motor Mouth!

28:40.261 --> 28:43.597
You wanna dance, Snow boy? Come on!

28:43.681 --> 28:47.977
Has anybody in here seen my son Brady?

28:54.734 --> 28:57.862
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

28:57.945 --> 29:02.950
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.997
Hail Mary, Mother of God...

29:09.165 --> 29:11.459
Pray for us sinners...

29:12.543 --> 29:15.463
now and at the hour of our death...

29:24.805 --> 29:27.892
Herb, Herb, wait up, Herb!

29:29.059 --> 29:30.853
- Herb! Come on, Herb!
- Is that my boy?

29:30.936 --> 29:33.189
- Herb, don't go up there!
- Is that Brady?

29:33.272 --> 29:34.815
- Herb!
- Brady!

30:52.560 --> 30:55.729
Mr. And Mrs. Kincaid have asked...

30:55.813 --> 30:59.608
that I say a word of comfort to you,
if I could.

30:59.692 --> 31:06.156
If there is any word of comfort
I can give you, it's just this.

31:06.240 --> 31:10.870
That the face of the beast
always becomes known.

31:10.953 --> 31:15.291
And the time of the beast always passes.

31:21.046 --> 31:25.551
Nan, how about if I take the boy home?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.136
Red...

31:29.889 --> 31:32.600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.602
Come on, Marty, you're going with me.

31:34.685 --> 31:37.521
- Jane, see you at the house.
- All right.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.857
- Come on.
- How do you feel?

31:39.940 --> 31:41.442
How would you feel?

31:46.488 --> 31:49.158
I guess they better get that guy.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.452
- Uncle Red?
- Yeah?

31:51.535 --> 31:53.954
What if it's not a guy?

31:55.039 --> 31:56.832
What do you mean?

31:57.958 --> 32:01.337
Well, what if it's some kind of monster?

32:07.676 --> 32:10.304
Yeah, what if it's some kind of monster?

32:11.430 --> 32:16.393
- You know, a werewolf or something?
- That's a good one! Yeah!

32:25.611 --> 32:26.320
Here we go.

32:26.403 --> 32:30.032
You know, Tammy told me
she'd heard noises in the greenhouse.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.825
Growling noises.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.371
Her father was killed that night.

32:38.290 --> 32:43.295
Listen, Marty! You have got to get
this idea out of your head!

32:44.463 --> 32:47.883
Psychotics are more active
when the moon is full.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.637
And this guy's a psycho.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.599
When they catch him you're gonna find out
he's just as human as you and me.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.560
- Let's get the show on the road!
- Okay, okay!

32:59.478 --> 33:03.399
You all know what groups you're in
and what areas you'll be covering.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.277
Groups one through four in the woods
north of the Sturmfuller place.

33:07.361 --> 33:10.781
- Okay!
- Five and six west of Carson Creek.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.366
- Yeah
- Yeah

33:12.449 --> 33:16.578
If he comes out in the moonlight tonight,
we're gonna get that sucker!

33:16.662 --> 33:19.373
I want all of you people to go home!

33:19.456 --> 33:21.375
I don't remember deputizing
a single one of you.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.626
That's right, Joe!

33:22.710 --> 33:25.504
The only deputy you got
is that fat shit bag beside you.

33:25.587 --> 33:29.299
And neither one of you has done
anything about solving this case!

33:29.383 --> 33:32.803
- We'll catch him.
- You couldn't catch a cold!

33:35.180 --> 33:39.309
The law has a name
for what you people are planning.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.979
It's called "private justice".

33:42.896 --> 33:49.486
And private justice is about a step away
from lynch mobs and hang ropes!

33:50.404 --> 33:55.409
Now, I may be no J. Edgar Hoover,
but I am the law in Tarker's Mills.

33:57.870 --> 34:01.248
I want all you people to go home.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.335
Don't let this guy scare you!

34:05.419 --> 34:08.714
And what's he done since this whole thing
started but hang his face out?

34:08.797 --> 34:11.759
- He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!
- Shut up, Andy!

34:11.842 --> 34:14.928
- No, don't tell me to shut up!
- Yes!

34:16.554 --> 34:18.264
Shut up!

34:27.357 --> 34:31.027
I just came from my boy's funeral.

34:36.617 --> 34:39.495
Herb, I know how upset...

34:41.330 --> 34:44.875
- how grief-stricken you must be.
- He was torn apart.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.877
I know that. I...

34:48.045 --> 34:49.838
Upset?

34:51.090 --> 34:53.257
Grief-stricken?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.762
You don't know what those words mean.

34:58.472 --> 35:01.266
My son was torn to pieces.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.728
Pieces!

35:07.856 --> 35:11.401
My son was torn to pieces!

35:15.656 --> 35:19.868
You come in here and talk to these men
about "private justice"?

35:22.121 --> 35:25.082
You dare to do that!

35:27.709 --> 35:32.881
Why don't you go out
to Harmony Hill, Sheriff Haller...

35:33.632 --> 35:37.719
and dig up what's
left of my boy Brady...

35:37.803 --> 35:41.056
and explain to him
about "private justice".

35:42.474 --> 35:45.352
Would you wanna do that?

35:49.148 --> 35:50.983
As for me...

35:52.067 --> 35:57.239
I'm gonna go out and
hunt up a little private justice.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.622
You heard him!

36:05.706 --> 36:07.583
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

36:14.131 --> 36:16.425
Come on, boys!

36:16.508 --> 36:19.720
- Get outta the way, Reverend.
- Stop! Stop!

36:19.803 --> 36:23.140
Andy, Andy! Don't do this!

36:24.725 --> 36:26.894
- Joe!
- Let 'em go, Reverend.

36:26.977 --> 36:30.772
This is that "community spirit"
you talked about.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.242
Come on, boys, let's go!

36:42.326 --> 36:47.831
Virgil! Stop, stop!
This is a bad idea. Don't do this!

36:48.790 --> 36:51.126
No! David, no!

36:53.128 --> 36:54.630
David!

36:57.591 --> 36:58.967
Please! Please!

37:05.933 --> 37:07.976
It's about frickin' time!

37:27.955 --> 37:29.414
Come on!

37:37.339 --> 37:39.049
- What was that?
- It's over there.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.176
Don't point that at me.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.367
- Over here, Bob.
- Move it up there!

37:43.428 --> 37:45.639
- So we can tell which way it's going.
- Okay.

37:45.722 --> 37:48.767
Come on up here. Come on, Jerry, this way.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.895
- Damn, Jack. Turn away!
- All right, all right.

37:51.979 --> 37:55.232
- Move the other way.
- I'm sorry.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.315
Come on!

38:12.165 --> 38:14.543
Jesus, that was close.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.212
Come on. Be careful.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.158
- You gotta help me!
- What is it?

38:46.241 --> 38:51.496
- My foot! My foot! Get it off me!
- I'm coming, Sure. Sure.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.879
Okay. Okay!

38:58.962 --> 39:01.048
Hey, over here!

39:02.215 --> 39:05.177
Hold on. I'll get it! I'll get it!

39:11.683 --> 39:14.269
Watch each other's back now.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.858
Andy, there ain't nothin' here.
Let's go back to the car!

39:19.941 --> 39:21.735
Bobby, come on.

39:24.613 --> 39:27.199
- Careful, Maggie.
- Damn!

39:28.909 --> 39:32.079
Alright, we're gonna go through here.

39:32.162 --> 39:35.957
- You follow me one at a time.
- I'm right behind you.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.177
Wait.

40:02.275 --> 40:05.904
- It came from over there.
- As far as I could tell, it came in back of us.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.615
He ain't down there, Andy.

40:08.698 --> 40:13.245
We're gonna spread out in a skirmish line.
That son-of-a-bitch tries to come around us.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.247
We'll get him!

40:16.623 --> 40:18.333
Okay, Edgar.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.795
Oh, shit!

40:28.051 --> 40:29.051
Come on.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.264
I don't know...

40:32.347 --> 40:34.850
What's wrong, Bobbie,
you gonna make lemonade in your pants?

40:34.933 --> 40:37.978
I ain't scared! Let's go.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.798
Where's it coming from? Over there?

41:06.882 --> 41:08.967
No, it's behind us.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.678
I told you you couldn't trust this fog.

41:12.596 --> 41:16.057
It's under the fog.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.851
What are you saying?

41:17.934 --> 41:20.520
It's right here with us.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.000
I can't move!

41:42.083 --> 41:44.628
Start backing up, Andy!

41:46.588 --> 41:48.840
Real... slow.

41:59.142 --> 42:00.185
Oh, my God!

42:02.395 --> 42:04.356
Come on, come on!

42:09.027 --> 42:13.240
Son-of-bitch! I'll get...

43:29.316 --> 43:31.276
It's hard...

43:32.027 --> 43:37.741
at a time like this to find the words
to offer you any comfort.

43:37.824 --> 43:40.535
There is no comfort!

43:44.289 --> 43:48.335
There is only private justice.

43:52.922 --> 44:00.096
The Bible tells us not
to fear the terror...

44:00.180 --> 44:02.641
that creepeth by night.

44:02.724 --> 44:05.727
Or that which flyeth by noon day.

44:05.810 --> 44:09.356
And yet, we do. We do.

44:09.439 --> 44:14.444
Because there's so much we don't know.
And we feel very small.

44:14.527 --> 44:18.073
Reverend! He was torn apart!

44:26.206 --> 44:27.749
No!

44:28.333 --> 44:29.459
No!

45:11.918 --> 45:14.921
Let it end, dear God! Let it end.

45:27.392 --> 45:31.020
Oh, they cancelled the fireworks!
It's no fair.

45:31.104 --> 45:34.899
Oh, look out world, Marty the Great
didn't get something he wanted!

45:34.983 --> 45:38.695
- Stop it, Jane!
- I don't see why everybody cries...

45:38.778 --> 45:42.949
- when Marty doesn't get what he wants.
- Pumpkin, what did your mother say?

45:44.033 --> 45:46.870
It's time you backed off, young lady!

45:46.953 --> 45:50.415
- Oh, it's always my fault.
- Jane, you won't let up.

45:50.498 --> 45:53.168
- Come on, now, let's get home.
- I don't believe it.

45:53.251 --> 45:57.172
<i>Residents can insure their safety
by observing the sheriff's curfew...</i>

45:57.255 --> 45:59.883
<i>and not by leaving town.</i>

45:59.966 --> 46:01.468
<i>And a personal note, folks:</i>

46:01.551 --> 46:05.472
<i>This is a time for pulling together,
not for bailing out.</i>

46:05.555 --> 46:08.475
<i>Now for Sue Ann Eckerstein.</i>

46:23.823 --> 46:25.992
I need the Phillips screwdriver.

46:29.204 --> 46:32.582
It's not enough the monster
killed all those people.

46:32.665 --> 46:34.542
He killed Brady.

46:34.626 --> 46:37.587
Now he's got them to cancel the fair.

46:38.505 --> 46:41.716
- And the fireworks.
- Yeah, and the fireworks.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.676
That's another thing.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.639
- Where's your mom?
- She and Dad are lighting the barbeque.

46:47.722 --> 46:50.558
And Jane's walking around
in her new clothes showing off her tits.

46:50.642 --> 46:53.436
Acts like nobody ever had tits before her.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.111
Let me see if I got this right.

47:02.195 --> 47:04.697
The guy killed your best friend.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.283
Drove your best girl outta town.

47:07.367 --> 47:10.703
Now he's responsible
for cancelling the only carnival you got.

47:10.787 --> 47:12.872
Am I lying?

47:12.956 --> 47:15.124
Now, you're not lying, Uncle Red.

47:15.208 --> 47:20.880
Well, it just so happens that I've got
something that might cheer you up...

47:21.673 --> 47:23.424
Oh, you mean I can see it?

47:23.508 --> 47:25.468
Yeah, it's time.

47:25.552 --> 47:27.512
- Now?
- Yeah, now. Cover your eyes.

47:27.595 --> 47:28.972
- Oh, come on.
- Cover your eyes.

47:29.055 --> 47:32.308
- Oh, Jesus...
- I busted my ass on this deal.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.621
Wow!

47:58.251 --> 48:00.420
It's an ass-kicker, isn't it?

48:01.880 --> 48:05.466
- Is that for me?
- Hell yes, it's for you!

48:06.843 --> 48:12.181
- Damn, looks good!
- Wow, it's beautiful!

48:14.017 --> 48:17.687
- Do you have a pilot's license?
- Do I need one?

48:25.069 --> 48:27.572
- Hey!
- Hey, Red.

48:29.282 --> 48:33.912
- The coast is clear. Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

48:33.995 --> 48:36.623
I feel like a virgin on prom night.

48:36.706 --> 48:38.625
Here's how you start it.

48:41.628 --> 48:43.129
- Remember what I told you?
- Yeah.

48:43.212 --> 48:45.006
- Now be damned careful.
- Okay.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.799
- Now, you start it.
- Okay.

48:46.883 --> 48:48.551
- Put your hand on the brake.
- Push?

48:48.635 --> 48:50.053
Push!

48:52.096 --> 48:53.556
- Sounds good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.058
- Yeah, you ready?
- Yes.

48:55.141 --> 48:56.643
Shake!

48:57.518 --> 48:59.395
Go get 'em, now!

49:01.731 --> 49:03.983
Go! Be careful!

49:13.117 --> 49:14.577
Stop, brake!

49:16.412 --> 49:17.872
Oh, the kid's dead meat!

49:20.833 --> 49:22.335
Oh, yes!

49:25.421 --> 49:26.673
All right!

49:49.112 --> 49:50.613
Oh, yeah!

50:08.673 --> 50:10.508
That was wicked.

50:11.843 --> 50:15.847
I hope you're happy.
You're lookin' at a dying man here.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.850
This thing goes super, super fast.

50:18.933 --> 50:22.520
I know it goes super fast.
And you better watch out.

50:22.603 --> 50:24.689
Because if your mother finds out
just how fast it goes...

50:24.772 --> 50:28.192
I'm gonna end up
singing soprano in the boy's choir.

50:28.276 --> 50:31.863
- You know, I don't get you.
- I know you don't.

50:31.946 --> 50:32.989
But listen to me.

50:33.072 --> 50:38.327
I built that for you because
I love ya, right from my heart.

50:38.411 --> 50:40.288
And I want you to be careful on it.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.999
Because if you got hurt, it'd kill me.

50:43.082 --> 50:45.084
Let's get some barbecue, okay?

50:45.168 --> 50:48.296
Boy I tell you,
after every pork dinner I eat...

50:48.379 --> 50:49.964
I got fire in the hole.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.592
- One more piece of pie.
- Are you sure about that?

50:52.675 --> 50:56.721
- Oh, Jesus...
- Would anybody else like a bite?

50:56.804 --> 50:58.204
- The mayo's good.
- Well, go ahead.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.767
Listen, no, put it down.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.227
- I've gotta go.
- Okay.

51:03.311 --> 51:05.813
- I've had a wonderful time.
- So have I.

51:05.897 --> 51:07.337
I wish it could always be like this.

51:07.398 --> 51:10.943
Maybe it will, if you keep inviting me
to these pork dinners.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.528
- Okay, it's a deal.
- Well, nice to meet you.

51:12.612 --> 51:13.654
Thanks. You too.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.239
- Bye.
- See you later, Janie.

51:15.323 --> 51:17.366
- Bob.
- So long, Red.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.787
- Good thing you didn't spill my drink.
- Okay.

51:20.870 --> 51:23.581
Why don't you walk me to my car?

51:23.664 --> 51:25.666
Walk me to my car and see if I can
stay out of trouble.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.293
- Thanks!
- Bye!

51:27.376 --> 51:30.171
- Bye!
- Come on, let's go!

51:33.549 --> 51:35.760
Can I have some more coffee?

51:37.553 --> 51:41.474
I tell you, I'm gonna start up
a reptile farm...

51:41.557 --> 51:44.852
- You're nuts.
- That'd be some kind of barbecue!

51:44.936 --> 51:46.813
Here we go. Hold on.

51:52.527 --> 51:56.739
Now, I said I had something for you,
as I believe you do recall.

51:56.823 --> 51:59.325
Yeah, what is it?

51:59.408 --> 52:04.539
You're gonna have Fourth of July,
but you're gonna have it in September.

52:06.290 --> 52:08.918
Now remember, it isn't just the fireworks.

52:09.001 --> 52:12.088
It's so no crazy shithead
can stop the good guys...

52:12.171 --> 52:14.590
- If you can dig that.
- Yeah, I dig it.

52:14.674 --> 52:16.759
- Now stay near the house.
- Yeah, sure.

52:16.843 --> 52:18.302
Okay.

52:19.387 --> 52:21.430
Save this for the last.

52:21.514 --> 52:24.684
It's a rocket. You'll like it.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.327
- Thanks a million, Uncle Red.
- You're welcome a Million, Marty.

52:27.395 --> 52:30.857
- And stick 'em in the bushes for now, okay?
- All right.

52:32.066 --> 52:35.820
Now remember...
stay... near... the house. Okay?

52:35.903 --> 52:37.113
- I promise.
- Okay.

52:37.196 --> 52:40.449
- All right.
- That's good. I want you to have a good time.

52:40.533 --> 52:42.618
Thanks a lot, Uncle Red.

52:44.120 --> 52:47.248
- Watch out for the werewolf!
- Bye.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.414
All right.

54:23.469 --> 54:25.846
This is for the good guys.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.179
Oh, shit.

57:20.187 --> 57:22.189
- Hello?
- <i>Uncle Red, it's me, Marty.</i>

57:22.273 --> 57:25.067
- <i>I saw the werewolf last night.
- Oh, Marty...</i>

57:25.151 --> 57:28.279
- <i>I saw the werewolf!</i>
- Hey, buddy, you had a bad dream.

57:28.362 --> 57:31.365
<i>It wasn't a dream, Uncle Red.
I saw the werewolf with the fireworks.</i>

57:31.449 --> 57:34.535
There are no such things as werewolves.

57:34.618 --> 57:37.913
<i>There is, I saw it!
Uncle Red, it was a werewolf.</i>

57:37.997 --> 57:40.082
Have some pity on your poor uncle, okay?

57:40.166 --> 57:42.084
<i>Uncle Red, I saw it!</i>

57:43.085 --> 57:44.753
Jesus...

57:45.629 --> 57:48.257
- What?
- Who was that?

57:50.259 --> 57:51.594
Obscene phone call.

57:54.638 --> 57:57.391
Marty, you okay?

57:58.058 --> 58:00.728
You've just been sitting here all morning.

58:01.604 --> 58:03.606
Where's Mom?

58:03.689 --> 58:05.941
Out shopping. Why?

58:06.025 --> 58:07.818
Jane, I gotta talk to you.

58:09.487 --> 58:11.197
About what?

58:13.115 --> 58:17.661
Well, Uncle Red won't believe me,
and if you don't help me...

58:19.246 --> 58:20.873
What is it?

58:23.959 --> 58:30.257
<i>He told me something unbelievable.
Yet somehow, I believed most of it.</i>

58:30.341 --> 58:37.515
<i>But I understood one thing completely,
Marty himself believed it all.</i>

58:49.026 --> 58:52.488
<i>Marty had seen where
the rocket had struck home, he said.</i>

58:52.571 --> 58:56.867
<i>And I went out that day looking for more
than just cans and bottles.</i>

58:56.951 --> 58:57.993
Hi, Mrs. Thayer.

58:58.077 --> 59:01.872
I'm collecting returnable bottles and
cans for the MEDCU drive.

59:01.956 --> 59:04.833
I was wondering if you had any.

59:05.751 --> 59:10.506
<i>I was looking for a man
or a woman with just one eye.</i>

59:10.589 --> 59:11.799
Hello, Jane.

59:13.342 --> 59:16.262
- Who is it?
- It's Jane Coslaw.

59:19.765 --> 59:21.475
Hello, Jane.

59:29.858 --> 59:32.736
I know what you're after, Jane,
and you're outta luck.

59:32.820 --> 59:36.782
Little Toby Whittislaw come in here
yesterday, and I give 'em all to him.

59:36.865 --> 59:38.826
That's okay.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.641
Is that you, Mr. Fairton?

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:15.988
- Got any bottles or cans?
- No.

01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:24.038
- Goodbye, Mr. McLaren.
- Bye, Jane.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.706
Jesus...

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:36.550
Gentlemen...

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:39.428
I'm sorry to disturb your lunch.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:41.513
I'm collecting bottles for the MEDCU drive.

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:45.434
I was just wondering
if any of you had seen Mr. Robertson?

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.064
Oh, hi, Mr. Robertson.
I was wondering if you had any.

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.151
I guess not. Thanks.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:01:00.783
It's my own fault for believing Marty.
The little asshole.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:10.292
Hi, Reverend Lowe.
I'm ready to turn my bottles in.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.712
Hi, Janie. And how are you?

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:17.383
All right, I guess.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:21.095
It's just that my brother
gets me so mad sometimes.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.805
Well, Jane...

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:27.267
little brothers sometimes do that.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:31.271
Take your cart on around to the garage
and bring me your tally sheet.

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:12.873
Having some trouble?

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:29.223
Why Jane, you're trembling.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.392
I don't feel well.

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:36.522
- I think maybe I got too much sun.
- Well, would you like to come in the parlor...

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:39.900
- and lie down for a bit?
- No!

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:44.446
Or have a cold drink? I have some soda.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:46.824
I think I should get home
and help my mom with dinner.

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:49.117
- I'll give you a ride.
- No!

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:56.750
Give my best to your brother, Jane.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:59.002
I will!

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:07.970
Jeez... what did you do then?

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:12.349
I ran faster than I've ever run
in my entire life. What do you think?

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:16.019
By the time I got back here
I thought I was gonna faint.

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:20.649
Marty, what are we gonna do?

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.487
If we tell anyone...
grownups, I mean, they'd laugh.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.116
Well, what are we gonna do?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.286
I think I know.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.599
<i>I mailed another letter
from Marty the next day.</i>

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.559
<i>A third the day after that.</i>

01:05:37.643 --> 01:05:41.647
<i>Then on Saturday we told
Uncle Red what we'd been up to.</i>

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.191
<i>His reaction was less than serene.</i>

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:47.319
Holy jumped-up, bald-headed,
Jesus palomino!

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:50.030
- Uncle Red...
- From him, I'd expect it.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:53.784
Sometimes I think your common sense
got paralyzed along with your legs.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:56.995
But from you, Jane,
you're Miss Polly Practical!

01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:58.330
You don't understand.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:01.041
I understand that my niece and my nephew...

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.244
are sending little love notes
to the local minister...

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.712
suggesting that he gargle
with broken glass...

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:08.423
- or eat a rat poison omelet!
- It came for me.

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:11.218
I shot it in the eye,
now he's wearing an eye patch!

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:15.305
I wish I had a tape recorder
so you could hear what you sound like.

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.641
What about the baseball bat
Jane saw in his shed?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:21.353
- What about it?
- You know who used to have a bat like that?

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:22.688
- Mr. Knopfler.
- So?

01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:25.649
It looked like Bigfoot had used it
for a toothpick.

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.234
Do you wanna know what I think?

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.278
No, we just wanted to admire you.

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:35.409
You better watch your mouth right now.
You're on thin ice with me, son.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:40.205
I think you had a hallucination.
The thing was probably a broomstick.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:43.417
It was not! Want me to show you?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.544
I'm not afraid!
I'll show it to you right now!

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:47.796
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:51.049
I'm a little too old to be playing
"the Hardy Boys meet Reverend Werewolf"!

01:06:51.133 --> 01:06:54.011
- Jane, forget it.
- Jesus! Yeah, forget it. Forget it.

01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:56.513
- Werewolf!
- Probably have gotten rid of it by now anyway.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.932
This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:01.184
Just forget it! It's crazy!

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:06.982
- You see your suspect yet, Marty?
- Yes, I see him.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:10.652
Are you saying he took
a rocket in the eye...

01:07:10.736 --> 01:07:13.030
and now he's out here painting?

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:16.074
He'd be in the hospital
or he would be dead.

01:07:16.158 --> 01:07:19.077
I didn't shoot him when he was...

01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:23.040
What? A werewolf? Oh, Jesus!

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.586
Jane, you don't believe
this madness, do you?

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.464
I don't know exactly what I believe.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:35.135
But I know that what I saw
was a baseball bat, and not a broomstick.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:39.347
And I know there was something strange
about the way the garage smelled.

01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:42.726
It smelled like an animal's den.
And I believe in Marty.

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:46.063
You used to believe in him too, Uncle Red.

01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:50.442
Kids...

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:41.326
Hey, Marty, you wanna go
to Robertson's for a soda?

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.703
No, thanks. I think I'm gonna go home.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:46.872
- Okay, see you!
- Yeah. See you!

01:09:56.902 --> 01:09:58.403
Oh, shit!

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.739
Oh, my God!

01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:08.163
Come on. Please!

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.749
Come on!

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:26.348
Come on! Come on!

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:40.607
Marty...

01:12:41.608 --> 01:12:44.152
I'm very sorry about this, Marty.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:46.905
I don't know if you believe that or not,
but it's true.

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:50.283
I would never willingly hurt a child.

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.620
Please... I won't tell anyone.

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:57.957
You should have let me alone, Marty.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.460
I can't kill myself.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:04.089
Our religion teaches
that suicide is the greatest sin...

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.758
a man or a woman can commit.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.552
Stella was going to commit suicide.

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:13.890
And if she had done so,
she would be burning in hell right now.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.393
By killing her I took her physical life...

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:19.771
but I saved her life eternal!

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:26.903
You see how all things serve the will
and the mind of God.

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:30.949
You see! You meddling little shit!

01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:34.035
You're going to have
a terrible accident, Marty.

01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:36.329
You're gonna fall in the river.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:48.425
Mr. Zinneman! Help me, please! Help me!

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:52.679
Mr. Zinneman! Wait! Mr. Zinneman!

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:55.640
On the bridge! Help me, please!

01:13:57.976 --> 01:13:59.144
That you, Marty?

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:13.491
Spooky in there, isn't it?

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:22.584
It's easier to swallow without
the foaming jaws, the hair and teeth.

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.253
- Did you talk to the Sheriff?
- Yes.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:29.257
After Marty's latest,
thrilling tale of wonder.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.594
But he's had no complaints
of poison pen pals.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.138
- See, told ya.
- Shut up, Marty.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.254
What color is Lowe's car?

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.965
Blue.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:15.303
This blue.

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:22.936
Jesus...

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.985
That is the craziest, goddamn story
I have ever heard in my life.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.613
I know.

01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.409
Do you believe any of this?

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:45.250
You do, don't you?

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:49.629
Well, let's just say I believe
Reverend Lowe oughta be checked out.

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:53.591
That can be arranged.

01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:56.803
Thank you, Joe.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.569
Reverend Lowe?

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:11.539
Can I help you, Joe?

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.797
I think you'd better
come along with me, Reverend.

01:19:28.306 --> 01:19:30.516
It's not my fault!

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:07.303
Sheriff Haller said he'd check him out.
And guess what?

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.722
No one sees him again.

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:13.226
What do you suggest I do about it?

01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:21.734
I want you to turn this
into a silver bullet.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:35.081
You won't let go of it, will you?

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:40.294
- I saw what I saw.
- Marty, the moon wasn't even full.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:46.050
In the legends, the werewolf guy
only changes when the moon is full.

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:49.387
But maybe he's like this
almost all the time.

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:53.724
- Only, as the moon gets fuller...
- the guy gets wolfier.

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:55.935
- Shit...
- Here!

01:20:56.686 --> 01:21:00.648
- Take mine too.
- Why don't you guys tell me...

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.526
how this guy Lowe became a werewolf?

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.654
I don't know.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.699
Maybe he doesn't know either.

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:13.327
I think he's going to come after me.

01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:16.622
Not just because I know who he is...

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.585
but because I hurt him.

01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:24.547
And I think he'll wait till
the moon's all the way full...

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.717
and there's no Reverend Lowe at all.

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.012
Only the monster.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:38.644
You've gone right outta your mind.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.898
Will you do it?

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:49.113
Boy...

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.616
Stay!

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:04.962
Hello.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.968
My nephew has just
discovered the Lone Ranger.

01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:13.721
And I wondered if you could help me here.

01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:26.108
You want a silver bullet, huh?

01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:32.949
<i>The man Uncle Red had gone to see
was more than a gunsmith.</i>

01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:37.662
<i>He was, Uncle Red said,
"an old world craftsman ".</i>

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:40.748
<i>A sort of wizard of weapons.</i>

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:47.964
<i>He confirmed the high silver content
of my crucifix and Marty's medallion.</i>

01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:52.969
<i>He melted them down and
molded them into a silver bullet.</i>

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:10.820
<i>Marty had read all the legends
about werewolves.</i>

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:16.367
<i>And though they differed on several
minor points, they all agreed on one.</i>

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.084
<i>It takes silver to kill a werewolf.</i>

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:29.255
<i>And we were taking no chances.</i>

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.467
There it is.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:37.638
Nicest piece of work I ever done, I think.

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:43.811
It's got a low-grain
load so it won't tumble.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:50.276
- Oughta be pretty accurate.
- Well, shoot, it's just a gag.

01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:58.117
I mean, what the heck you gonna shoot
a 44 bullet at anyway, made of silver?

01:23:59.994 --> 01:24:02.538
How about a werewolf?

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:09.253
<i>The night of the next
full moon came on Halloween.</i>

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:12.548
<i>And a happy coincidence left us
in the sole care of Uncle Red.</i>

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:15.634
Luggage for a month
going to New York for a weekend.

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:18.971
- <i>At least it seemed like a coincidence.</i>
- And remember, we'll be at the Plaza.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:21.682
- And I've got the number.
- Right.

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:27.313
- Hey... goodbye!
- Bye!

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.607
- Goodbye, honey.
- Goodbye.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:33.778
- Thank you! Thank you so much!
- Whoa, Sis.

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:36.197
It's just my luck to win
a romantic trip for two...

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.157
after Sheila leaves me.
That's how it is.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.367
- Have you got the tickets?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.995
- Okay, now go and have fun.
- Bye.

01:24:43.079 --> 01:24:44.371
- Have fun, Bob.
- You too, Red.

01:24:44.455 --> 01:24:46.373
And don't let these kids run you ragged.

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:48.626
- Naw, they won't run me ragged.
- And listen.

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:51.420
Don't let any trick-or-treaters in,
even if they come.

01:24:51.504 --> 01:24:53.714
- We won't.
- We won't.

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:55.091
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye!

01:24:55.174 --> 01:24:57.009
- Bye-bye.
- Have fun.

01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:58.844
Oh, listen! You kids go to bed early.

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:01.597
You're gonna hurt you head
poppin' in-and-out like that!

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.349
Be good, kids!

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.726
- Yeah, we will.
- Yeah, we will.

01:25:07.645 --> 01:25:10.648
- Could I tell you kids something? '
- Sure, Uncle Red.

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:15.361
Me and Nan, were just like you guys
when we were growin' up.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.698
And the bitch of it is, we still are.

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:24.328
Did you really win a trip to New York
from Publisher's Clearing House?

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.038
No.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.209
But the moon is full.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.545
And your parents are gone.

01:25:33.254 --> 01:25:36.966
And I did win a subscription
to Popular Mechanics.

01:26:18.549 --> 01:26:20.134
Oh, God!

01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:26.974
You're gonna burn yourself up sometime
doing that Uncle Red.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.100
Probably will.

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:33.981
If that would have gone off,
that've been the end of our Silver Bullet.

01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:36.942
This is too much.

01:26:41.906 --> 01:26:43.616
You guys are goin' to bed.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:46.744
- But Uncle Red, you said...
- I know what I said.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:49.496
But it's ten till three in the morning
and it's not coming.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.791
- The moon's not down yet.
- Well, it's damn near down.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:57.713
I'm gonna sit up the rest of the night
with this stupid gun in my lap...

01:26:57.796 --> 01:26:59.798
because I promised I'd do that.

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:04.178
- But you're going to bed, so are you.
- What happens if I say no?

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:07.765
Then I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:27:11.018 --> 01:27:14.313
- It's a werewolf! I saw him! It's a werewolf!
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:17.858
- What did you see?
- The werewolf!

01:27:18.859 --> 01:27:22.363
- What did you see?
- I was looking at you.

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:26.200
God damn...

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:31.205
Uh... it's okay. I'll go look, that's all.

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:10.286
A very familiar feeling
is beginning to come over me.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:11.912
What?

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:21.588
I'm beginning to feel like a horse's ass,
that's what.

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:24.008
He's out there! I saw him!

01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:27.469
I know you did, Janie.
Why don't you just go upstairs?

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:37.938
Now don't panic!

01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:42.776
He's here.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.322
Marty, it could be just a fuse.

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:57.207
Shit!

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.188
Over here! Watch out!

01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:25.903
Jane, get the gun!

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:48.384
Hurry, Marty! Please, hurry!

01:29:57.643 --> 01:29:59.561
Leave him alone!

01:30:09.029 --> 01:30:11.073
Shoot! Shoot!

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:14.761
Holy jumped up Jesus Palomino.

01:31:15.429 --> 01:31:16.889
God...

01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:36.366
It's okay. I gotcha. I gotcha.

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:40.329
Don't worry. He's dead.

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:46.627
Are you all right?

01:31:48.587 --> 01:31:51.048
All except for my legs.

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:52.758
What?

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:57.471
I don't think I can walk.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.186
I love you, Jane.

01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:09.816
I love you, too.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.947
<i>I wasn't always able to say that.</i>

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:17.991
<i>But I can say it now.</i>

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:21.411
<i>I love you, too, Marty.</i>

01:32:21.495 --> 01:32:23.330
<i>Good night.</i>
