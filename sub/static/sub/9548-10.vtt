00:05.810 --> 00:08.779
I'm here at the Bayside Correctional
Facility right now where

00:08.847 --> 00:12.840
a state-wide manhunt is underway
for this man, Joe Endicott.

00:13.218 --> 00:16.517
Endicott escaped last night
after tunneling under that fence

00:16.821 --> 00:20.723
and then killing a woman here in the
parking lot before fleeing the scene.

00:20.825 --> 00:24.056
Authorities are now warning
that Endicott might be armed

00:24.129 --> 00:26.962
and must be considered
extremely dangerous.

00:27.032 --> 00:28.499
Thank you,
Nancy, for that.

00:28.566 --> 00:31.535
We will all be keeping you
updated as this story develops.

01:24.489 --> 01:26.320
Don't move!
Hey, man, that really hurt!

01:26.391 --> 01:28.382
Don't make a move!
There's gun in here!

01:28.460 --> 01:31.861
Hey. Hey...
I said don't move!

01:31.930 --> 01:33.454
I didn't move.

01:33.531 --> 01:35.522
There's a gun in here.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.495
Take my word for it.

01:37.569 --> 01:40.436
Where you going?
Hey, Adrian...

01:41.606 --> 01:42.903
Wait, who you calling?

01:42.974 --> 01:44.202
Who do you think
I'm calling?

01:44.275 --> 01:46.835
Oh, you don't want to call the cops, man.
I don't, huh?

01:46.911 --> 01:49.243
No, come on, put the phone
down! And the gun.

01:49.314 --> 01:51.009
Give me one good reason.

01:51.082 --> 01:52.344
I'm your brother!

01:58.590 --> 02:00.455
It's a jungle out there

02:01.059 --> 02:03.892
Disorder and confusion
everywhere

02:05.663 --> 02:07.927
No one seems to care

02:07.999 --> 02:08.988
Well, I do

02:09.067 --> 02:11.763
Hey, who's in charge here?

02:11.836 --> 02:13.804
It's a jungle out there

02:15.673 --> 02:18.403
Poison in the very air
we breathe

02:18.943 --> 02:21.377
You know what's in the water
that you drink?

02:21.446 --> 02:22.435
Well, I do

02:22.514 --> 02:25.176
It's amazing

02:25.717 --> 02:27.241
People think I'm crazy

02:27.318 --> 02:28.979
'cause I worry
all the time

02:29.053 --> 02:31.419
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

02:32.257 --> 02:33.656
You better pay attention

02:33.725 --> 02:35.989
Or this world
we love so much

02:36.661 --> 02:39.596
might just kill you

02:40.331 --> 02:41.992
I could be wrong now

02:42.634 --> 02:44.363
But I don't think so

02:44.469 --> 02:46.835
'Cause there's
a jungle out there

02:47.238 --> 02:49.365
It's a jungle out there

02:54.023 --> 02:55.183
You're my...

02:56.526 --> 02:58.994
I'm Jack, Jr.
I'm your brother.

02:59.629 --> 03:02.120
Well, technically
I'm your half-brother.

03:02.198 --> 03:04.291
So you could say
I'm rounding up.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.037
Come on, Dad must have
told you about me.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.506
Right? I mean,
I can't imagine what he said, but...

03:12.942 --> 03:15.467
As you can see,
it's pretty much true.

03:16.246 --> 03:17.679
911.
What is your emergency?

03:17.747 --> 03:19.681
Come on, man,
give me a chance, okay?

03:19.749 --> 03:21.512
I'm your brother.
I'm family.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.211
Family?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.311
Yeah. Can't you
feel it?

03:25.388 --> 03:26.855
911. Sir?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.082
No.

03:29.359 --> 03:33.591
Are... Really? Come on,
we have the same DNA, same Dad.

03:33.663 --> 03:35.824
Same alcoholic
son of a bitch.

03:35.898 --> 03:39.493
Do you know, he ran out on us
ten years after he bailed on you?

03:40.069 --> 03:41.229
Uh-huh.

03:41.771 --> 03:43.864
Fine. You still don't believe me.
All right, ask me something.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.703
Don't! Don't! Wait!

03:46.242 --> 03:48.472
Ask you what?

03:48.544 --> 03:53.174
About... Us, Dad, anything.
Go. Shoot.

03:53.249 --> 03:54.682
Okay. What was
his favorite song?

03:54.751 --> 03:57.686
Ain't Misbehavin'.
Sang it in the bathtub.

03:58.721 --> 03:59.881
How did he take
his coffee?

03:59.956 --> 04:01.014
With whiskey.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.581
Jameson's, if he could afford
it, which he never could.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.557
Sir, are you still there?

04:07.230 --> 04:08.424
Jack!

04:11.100 --> 04:12.658
Should we hug?
No.

04:12.735 --> 04:15.602
Hey, come on.
I really think we should hug.

04:15.705 --> 04:17.570
No.
911. Are you still there?

04:20.043 --> 04:22.170
I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

04:30.386 --> 04:33.014
Okay.
Who's Joe Endicott?

04:33.356 --> 04:37.349
I am, well, at least that's
who I was when I was arrested.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.395
Yeah. Arrested for what?

04:39.462 --> 04:41.089
Selling cars.

04:41.164 --> 04:43.724
That weren't mine.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.462
Exactly.

04:47.303 --> 04:49.328
I'm starving.
Do you have any food?

04:49.405 --> 04:52.340
No! No, no, no, no!
No, wait. Whoa!

04:52.675 --> 04:55.269
You, you, you, you...
You're not eating here.

04:56.179 --> 04:57.373
All right.

04:57.847 --> 05:00.077
You want to tell me what happened last night?

05:00.416 --> 05:02.850
Yeah. I busted out.
That's what happened.

05:03.186 --> 05:04.778
You killed a woman.

05:04.854 --> 05:06.321
No way. Hey!

05:06.389 --> 05:08.687
Adrian, look!
Hand to God.

05:09.425 --> 05:11.120
I've never hurt anybody!
Uh-huh.

05:11.194 --> 05:12.218
Ever!

05:12.295 --> 05:15.924
I'm a con man.
I'm a grifter. I'm a...

05:16.566 --> 05:17.999
Loveable rogue.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.625
A loveable rogue?

05:20.436 --> 05:23.428
People don't call themselves,
"loveable rogues."

05:23.740 --> 05:25.674
Loveable rogues do.

05:26.109 --> 05:27.371
This is ridiculous.

05:27.443 --> 05:28.467
Why?

05:28.544 --> 05:32.173
Come on, what are you doing? Adrian,
no, no, no, wait, wait! Think about it!

05:32.248 --> 05:35.979
I could be halfway to Paraguay right now,
but I'm not. I'm here.

05:36.052 --> 05:38.486
I came to you!
What does that tell you?

05:38.921 --> 05:42.254
That you're an unstable person
and that you belong in prison.

05:42.325 --> 05:46.193
No, that I need your help.
Come on, I didn't kill that woman!

05:47.630 --> 05:49.154
I crawled through the sewer.

05:49.232 --> 05:51.564
When I got to the parking lot,
she was already dead.

05:51.634 --> 05:54.797
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Go back.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.134
You crawled through
the what?

05:58.474 --> 06:00.271
I crawled through the sewer.
That's how I escaped.

06:00.343 --> 06:02.277
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Go back...

06:03.880 --> 06:06.610
You crawled
through the what?

06:08.384 --> 06:09.874
The sewer?
Wait.

06:10.887 --> 06:12.047
Go back.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.732
What happened?
The shower stopped.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.105
You ran out of hot water.

06:33.176 --> 06:34.939
No, no, no. Keep washing.

06:35.011 --> 06:36.137
I'm freezing!

06:36.212 --> 06:38.510
Keep washing. Just...

06:38.581 --> 06:40.913
Oh, my God!
What'd you do?

06:41.451 --> 06:43.783
A little camouflage.
Huh?

06:44.353 --> 06:46.321
Come on. People might see
us working on the case, so.

06:46.389 --> 06:47.583
What case?

06:47.657 --> 06:48.681
My case!

06:48.758 --> 06:51.022
I told you, I didn't kill that woman,
we've got to prove it.

06:51.093 --> 06:53.653
No, no, no, no, no.
There is no case.

06:53.729 --> 06:56.289
We're going to call the lawyer,
then you're going to turn yourself in.

06:56.365 --> 07:00.495
No! No, I can't do that.
I can't go back to jail, okay?

07:00.570 --> 07:02.800
Not yet. Hey,
how is Ambrose?

07:02.872 --> 07:04.806
He's... He's fine.

07:06.409 --> 07:09.810
You know what? We should call him.
I would love to say hi to him.

07:09.879 --> 07:12.643
I'd rather not
involve him. Excuse me.

07:12.715 --> 07:15.411
What do you mean,
you can't go back yet?

07:15.485 --> 07:19.285
Look, that woman, the woman that was killed,
Lindsey Bishop was her name.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.947
Hey... She was a social worker there.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.923
Everybody in the
joint loved her.

07:22.992 --> 07:26.621
She used to work on letters,
help people with their appeals.

07:26.696 --> 07:30.598
I mean, look,
if I go back there and they...

07:30.666 --> 07:34.193
Don't worry, it's perfect.
And they think that I killed her,

07:34.270 --> 07:37.103
I wouldn't last more than
ten minutes in there.

07:37.173 --> 07:41.803
Look, clear my name.
And then I'll go back, I promise.

07:45.114 --> 07:48.345
Hey. You know,
these are all the same.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.409
What, you wear the
same thing every day?

07:52.788 --> 07:54.585
I feel like
I'm back in prison.

07:57.193 --> 08:01.391
Hey. You know,
could I have a little bit of privacy, please?

08:01.797 --> 08:02.821
Thanks.

08:11.474 --> 08:12.634
Do you have any
other kind of mayo?

08:12.708 --> 08:13.732
What are you doing?

08:13.809 --> 08:15.834
I'm making a sandwich.
I'm starving.

08:17.547 --> 08:19.014
Are you ever going to tell me what happened?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.539
Yeah. After I eat, okay?
I have been running all night.

08:22.618 --> 08:23.983
No, no, no.
That's mine.

08:24.053 --> 08:25.577
Talk first. Then eat.

08:25.655 --> 08:30.024
Look, I can do both, all right?
There's not much to tell.

08:32.395 --> 08:35.193
It took me two months and 87
spoons to get out of there.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.491
What about
your cellmate?

08:36.566 --> 08:37.624
I didn't have one.

08:37.700 --> 08:41.466
Made life a lot easier. So last night,
after lights out, I made my move.

08:42.538 --> 08:44.802
So, three minutes later,
I was in the sewer pipe.

08:44.874 --> 08:47.365
Yeah, okay.
You can skip that part.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.537
The stench was God-awful.
It was like crawling through someone's...

08:50.613 --> 08:53.013
Yeah, it's okay.
Just skip ahead.

08:54.016 --> 08:57.110
Okay, about 3:00 a.m.,
I come out the other side, and I saw a car.

08:57.186 --> 09:00.747
Looked empty. I figured I got lucky.
I thought maybe I could hotwire it.

09:01.657 --> 09:04.854
I yank open the door,
and there she was.

09:05.661 --> 09:09.358
I tried calling 911,
but then some guard in the tower spots me,

09:09.432 --> 09:11.696
opened fire,

09:11.767 --> 09:14.292
and I just took off
and I never looked back.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.740
So, let me see
if I understand this.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.708
If you're telling
the truth.

09:20.776 --> 09:22.835
It's hand to God.
Right. Hand to God.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.073
This is your story.

09:25.581 --> 09:31.076
A homicidal maniac happened to be
strolling by the federal prison.

09:31.854 --> 09:33.446
He saw the car.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.190
He stabs the driver,
but he doesn't steal the car.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.193
He just runs away.

09:40.630 --> 09:43.690
A couple of minutes
later, Jack Monk, Jr.,

09:43.766 --> 09:47.930
crawls out of a manhole
a few yards away

09:48.004 --> 09:50.199
and finds the body?

09:52.908 --> 09:54.102
Yes.

09:54.944 --> 09:57.777
Thank you.
You've made this very easy for me.

09:58.114 --> 10:02.016
Oh. Wait. What are you doing?
Adrian, what are you doing?

10:02.318 --> 10:05.185
No, no, no,
what is it with you and the phone?

10:05.254 --> 10:08.087
Come on, you're treating me like
another schlub. This is family!

10:08.157 --> 10:11.058
Hey, this is family talking here.
That's got to mean something.

10:11.127 --> 10:12.355
Not to me.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.154
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, okay, okay.
You win. I'll go back to jail.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.527
Straight up,
I'll do my time. Okay?

10:22.605 --> 10:24.402
Just do me one favor.

10:25.841 --> 10:27.308
Let me call my mother.

10:28.444 --> 10:29.877
Your mother?

10:30.513 --> 10:33.073
Yes, Adrian.
I have a mother, too.

10:33.749 --> 10:36.547
Her name is Darlene Monk.
She lives in Amarillo, Texas.

10:36.619 --> 10:40.111
I'm sure she's been watching the news,
and she must be scared to death, okay?

10:40.756 --> 10:42.724
Come on.
Just one phone call.

10:44.193 --> 10:45.592
For old times' sake?

10:46.295 --> 10:48.229
We don't have
any old times.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.696
Sure, we do.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.968
Come on, remember?
Remember in the hallway,

10:54.537 --> 10:57.768
when you hit me over the
head with that metal box?

10:58.541 --> 11:00.406
That was a half hour ago.

11:00.476 --> 11:03.343
Yeah, well, it's something.
I mean, it's a start.

11:17.660 --> 11:20.754
Hello?
Hey, Mom, it's Jack.

11:20.830 --> 11:25.267
Jackie! My baby!
Are you okay? Yeah.

11:25.334 --> 11:27.700
On the news,
they said you killed a woman.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.206
No, Mom, I didn't kill anybody.
You got to believe me.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.297
My baby!

11:32.374 --> 11:35.070
I know. I wish I could prove it,
but I can't.

11:35.144 --> 11:39.308
Jackie. Go to your brother.
Go to Adrian.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.444
He has to help you.
He's family.

11:42.518 --> 11:45.419
Mom,
I'm with him right now,

11:45.488 --> 11:47.513
and he wants to
turn me in.

11:49.358 --> 11:52.794
Why?
Why won't he help us?

11:52.862 --> 11:54.727
I don't know, Mom.
I guess...

11:55.131 --> 11:57.429
Family doesn't mean
anything to him.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.128
Adrian Monk!
Are you there?

12:02.304 --> 12:03.931
Are you there?

12:07.409 --> 12:08.603
Hello.

12:09.478 --> 12:13.073
We've never met,
but I feel like I know you.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.880
Your father bragged
about you all the time.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.847
He did?

12:19.922 --> 12:22.152
He said you were
the light of his life.

12:22.224 --> 12:24.988
He said there's nothing
you couldn't do.

12:25.961 --> 12:29.863
I am begging you,
Adrian. I'm a mother.

12:29.932 --> 12:33.766
I'm on my knees.
Help my little boy.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.499
Help little Jackie!
He's no angel,

12:37.573 --> 12:39.598
but he wouldn't
hurt anybody.

12:42.711 --> 12:44.702
Okay. All right, Darlene?

12:46.448 --> 12:49.474
Ma'am? Darlene?
Lt... It's okay.

12:49.552 --> 12:53.010
I am going to
help your son.

12:53.088 --> 12:56.421
You are? He's going to be okay,
I promise.

12:56.492 --> 13:00.121
I'll do what I can.
Okay.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.563
God bless you, Adrian!
Oh! Yay! Yeah.

13:03.632 --> 13:05.463
Love you, Mom.

13:09.471 --> 13:10.995
Thanks, bro.

13:11.473 --> 13:12.770
Half-bro.

13:39.023 --> 13:40.615
Hey, Monk!

13:41.993 --> 13:43.290
Who's your friend?

13:43.361 --> 13:46.819
Ah. That's my pen pal.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.930
Pen pal! I didn't know
people still did that.

13:52.937 --> 13:54.199
Hey, you guys
even dress alike.

13:54.272 --> 13:55.603
Yeah.

13:55.673 --> 13:56.662
Where's he from?

13:56.741 --> 13:57.969
Canada.

13:58.476 --> 14:00.876
East Canada.
What's his name?

14:00.945 --> 14:03.175
Jack Gretzky.

14:03.915 --> 14:06.145
Really?
Any relation?

14:06.217 --> 14:09.186
Why would you say that?
We don't even look alike.

14:09.253 --> 14:13.383
No, not to you, to Wayne Gretzky,
the hockey player.

14:13.858 --> 14:15.223
Are you okay?

14:15.293 --> 14:17.056
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:17.762 --> 14:21.220
Let's just see what there is to see,
and then we can all go home.

14:21.299 --> 14:24.063
In separate cars.
That's it, huh?

14:24.135 --> 14:25.159
Yeah.

14:25.236 --> 14:28.103
Yeah, scary how easy
it was, huh?

14:29.307 --> 14:32.606
Ah. Here comes Randy.
He's got the warden with him.

14:32.677 --> 14:35.475
It's funny, you know,
I've known Mr. Monk for four years,

14:35.546 --> 14:37.946
and he never mentioned
having a pen pal.

14:38.015 --> 14:40.279
JACK, JR: Well, you know,
I shouldn't say anything else.

14:40.351 --> 14:43.081
I don't want to break
the pen pal code, so...

14:44.388 --> 14:46.185
Okay.

14:46.257 --> 14:47.246
Her cell phone?

14:47.325 --> 14:48.690
Yep.

14:50.595 --> 14:51.926
It wasn't near the car?

14:51.996 --> 14:54.089
Nope. That's right
where it was.

14:54.165 --> 14:56.030
Captain Stottlemeyer,
Adrian Monk.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.627
This is Tom Bennett, Dan Reese.
Tom's the Warden here.

14:59.704 --> 15:01.365
Warden.

15:01.439 --> 15:03.600
Whatever you need, Captain.
Whatever we can do.

15:03.674 --> 15:05.972
We appreciate that.
We've assembled a task force,

15:06.043 --> 15:08.705
working with the Sheriff's Department.
He can't get far. We'll find him.

15:08.780 --> 15:12.113
I can't wait to get that son of a
bitch back in here. This is personal.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.984
Everybody loved that woman.
Not just the inmates. Staff, too.

15:16.053 --> 15:19.489
Dan was on duty last night.
He's the one who sounded the alarm.

15:20.258 --> 15:22.886
Yeah, what was she doing
here at 3:00 in the morning?

15:22.960 --> 15:24.427
Well, Lindsey
worked late a lot.

15:24.495 --> 15:27.658
Sometimes she'd be here all night.
You know, dedicated.

15:27.732 --> 15:31.065
Did you actually see him,
the escapee, whose name,

15:31.135 --> 15:34.798
of course, is Joe Endicott,
attack Ms. Bishop?

15:34.872 --> 15:36.840
No, sir, I can't
say I did. I...

15:36.908 --> 15:40.708
I thought I heard something,
someone screaming, I hit the lights.

15:40.778 --> 15:42.746
He was right there,
right by the car.

15:42.814 --> 15:45.112
I got off about a dozen shots,
but he was gone.

15:45.183 --> 15:46.548
And that's the weapon.
Yeah.

15:46.617 --> 15:47.948
A fork or a spoon?

15:48.019 --> 15:51.455
They can make a knife out of anything.
Utensils, toothbrushes...

15:53.257 --> 15:55.191
"Gos" something.

15:55.893 --> 15:57.952
That's
sterling silver.

15:58.029 --> 15:59.018
Really?

16:00.665 --> 16:02.496
What are you guys doing up there,
having tea parties?

16:02.567 --> 16:06.230
That's not standard issue.
It must have been smuggled in.

16:08.506 --> 16:11.202
Dogs? Those dogs...

16:11.609 --> 16:13.804
Oh, Skinny must be bringing
the hounds back in.

16:13.878 --> 16:15.209
They must have
picked up his scent.

16:16.948 --> 16:19.849
Adrian! We've got to go!
We're late for the thing.

16:19.917 --> 16:21.885
That's Jack.
Um, my pen pal.

16:21.953 --> 16:23.580
How you doing?
We got to go. Remember?

16:23.654 --> 16:25.212
Yeah. Uh...

16:25.289 --> 16:28.588
Cap, we got to go.
Natalie's going to drop us off.

16:28.659 --> 16:31.856
Okay, I'll call you later.
I'll fill you in. Nice to meet you, Jack.

16:33.364 --> 16:34.797
Are you going to eat?

16:34.866 --> 16:36.128
Not here.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.260
Or near here.
Or far from here.

16:40.171 --> 16:42.366
Yeah, Dad said
you were peculiar.

16:43.774 --> 16:45.366
Mmm.

16:55.486 --> 16:56.885
I knew it.

16:56.954 --> 16:59.184
What was that?
It wasn't Spanish.

16:59.257 --> 17:02.283
It's Guarani.
It's the official language of Paraguay.

17:02.827 --> 17:06.455
Do you know that the most beautiful
women in the world come from Paraguay?

17:06.530 --> 17:07.827
Do they?

17:07.898 --> 17:09.059
Exhibit A.

17:09.133 --> 17:11.863
Who you didn't even look at.
What, are you human or what?

17:11.935 --> 17:13.597
I'm human enough.

17:15.606 --> 17:19.337
Okay, Sherlock. Where are we?
How's the case coming?

17:19.410 --> 17:22.310
The victim's cell phone was
exactly where you said it would be.

17:22.613 --> 17:25.137
And there was blood spatter
all over the car,

17:25.916 --> 17:28.112
but you didn't have
any on your pants.

17:28.452 --> 17:30.113
So?
So,

17:30.187 --> 17:32.951
there's a more than even chance
that you were telling the truth.

17:34.058 --> 17:35.650
We're going to hug soon.
I can feel it.

17:35.726 --> 17:38.320
No, we're not going to hug, Jack.
You're still a criminal.

17:38.396 --> 17:40.387
I can believe you
and still not like you.

17:40.464 --> 17:42.227
Well, who do you like?
I can be anybody.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.131
Listen to me.
This is serious.

17:44.201 --> 17:47.602
Somebody killed Lindsey
Bishop and tried to frame you.

17:47.972 --> 17:50.202
So who else knew you were planning to escape?

17:50.274 --> 17:52.299
Nobody.
Somebody did.

17:52.376 --> 17:54.367
Somebody knew you'd be
in that parking lot.

17:54.445 --> 17:57.642
Nobody! Hand to God,
nobody knew! Nobody! Nobody!

17:57.715 --> 17:59.410
Nobody! Nobody!

18:00.985 --> 18:02.350
Oh. Except Shiv.

18:05.489 --> 18:07.548
I have a follow-up question.

18:07.625 --> 18:08.614
Shoot.

18:10.161 --> 18:11.628
Who's Shiv?

18:11.696 --> 18:12.958
Oh, he's my cellmate.

18:13.030 --> 18:15.225
You said you didn't
have a cellmate.

18:15.299 --> 18:16.823
I don't think so.

18:16.901 --> 18:19.199
You must have misconstrued
my connotation.

18:23.474 --> 18:24.998
Tell me about Shiv.

18:26.577 --> 18:30.377
His real name is Norman Logan.
It was his cell. It was his plan.

18:30.448 --> 18:33.884
Somehow he got a hold of a real chisel,
and he dug the tunnel himself.

18:35.052 --> 18:37.885
They moved me into
his cell yesterday,

18:37.955 --> 18:40.150
and, um, he showed me
the tunnel.

18:40.224 --> 18:44.354
And I figured if someone was gonna bust out,
might as well be me.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.335
You said you'd never lie to me.
We had a deal.

18:52.403 --> 18:54.871
Okay, I know.
I did lie about Shiv.

18:54.939 --> 18:57.464
But that was before
I promised never to lie,

18:57.541 --> 18:59.736
so I don't think
that should count.

19:01.479 --> 19:03.379
What? What is that look?

19:03.447 --> 19:05.540
It's called disappointment,
Jack.

19:05.616 --> 19:08.414
I'm sure it's a look you've seen before.
Come on, let's go.

19:08.486 --> 19:09.976
Well, where
are we going?

19:10.054 --> 19:12.716
I'm going back to the prison
and talk to your cellmate.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.121
No, you...

19:14.825 --> 19:16.622
No, you can't
talk to Shiv.

19:16.694 --> 19:18.753
He'll know that we talked.
He'll know that we're together!

19:20.831 --> 19:23.857
All right, I'll have
the Captain ask around.

19:23.934 --> 19:25.458
But let's go.
Well, where now?

19:25.536 --> 19:27.299
Plan B.
Lindsey Bishop's house.

19:27.371 --> 19:28.804
I'm not... I can't...
I could...

19:28.873 --> 19:30.704
Come on.
I'm...

19:38.616 --> 19:41.084
I can't believe it!
I'm so...

19:41.152 --> 19:43.313
I still can't believe
that she's gone!

19:43.387 --> 19:45.981
Sir, I'm sorry.
I didn't even know she had a brother.

19:46.057 --> 19:48.252
We were close,
and of course, now...

19:49.293 --> 19:53.389
It's too late to tell her all
the things I wanted to tell her!

19:53.464 --> 19:55.364
Yeah, I know.
I'm going to miss her too.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.367
She was probably
my favorite tenant.

19:57.435 --> 19:58.493
Are you family too?

19:58.569 --> 19:59.661
Pen pal.

20:00.071 --> 20:02.665
Oh, okay.
Well, I'll let you two boys get to it.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.641
Just remember to
lock up as you leave.

20:08.512 --> 20:09.911
Again, I'm sorry.

20:14.485 --> 20:15.816
Wow. He was a nice guy.

20:15.886 --> 20:19.720
I can't help but notice your fake crying
looks a lot like your real crying.

20:19.990 --> 20:21.321
Thank you.

20:27.631 --> 20:29.462
I love what you do
with your hands.

20:31.368 --> 20:33.996
You're like one of
those pantomime guys, huh?

20:40.711 --> 20:42.474
Okay, what are
we looking for?

20:42.546 --> 20:46.414
I'm not sure.
I'll know it when I find it.

20:53.157 --> 20:55.455
What, what, what,
what are you doing?

20:55.526 --> 20:57.221
Believe me, brother,
she's not going to miss it.

20:57.294 --> 21:00.263
Put it back. You put...
Put it back.

21:00.698 --> 21:01.824
Fine.

21:03.033 --> 21:04.432
And the rest of it.

21:04.902 --> 21:07.962
Okay, Jiminy Cricket.
Look, you win! Putting it back!

21:14.445 --> 21:16.106
That's weird.
What is it?

21:16.947 --> 21:18.847
This picture's
out of focus.

21:19.350 --> 21:21.875
Here, look. That one
makes her look fat.

21:21.952 --> 21:23.283
These pictures
don't make sense.

21:23.354 --> 21:25.254
You're right.
They're terrible.

21:25.322 --> 21:27.984
She didn't put these up.
No one would.

21:28.626 --> 21:30.025
I don't understand.

21:40.704 --> 21:42.433
They're from this drawer.

21:42.873 --> 21:46.502
They're the discards.
Someone was in here after she died,

21:47.011 --> 21:50.139
removed the real pictures,
and replaced them with these.

21:50.748 --> 21:52.613
Why?

21:52.683 --> 21:54.708
Hmm. Maybe she was
having an affair

21:55.886 --> 21:57.820
and he didn't want
anyone to know.

21:59.790 --> 22:02.452
Wow! Wow!

22:02.893 --> 22:05.828
Dad was right.
You're like a wizard.

22:07.164 --> 22:09.826
Hey, we make a pretty good team, huh?
Come on!

22:09.900 --> 22:11.891
Hey, we could
be partners!

22:11.969 --> 22:13.027
The Monk brothers.

22:13.103 --> 22:14.195
Don't count on it.

22:14.271 --> 22:16.501
You're going back
to prison, remember?

22:16.574 --> 22:18.940
Oh, right.
Yeah, I forgot.

22:33.657 --> 22:36.785
My enemy seemed
immortal, more than a spider.

22:37.695 --> 22:40.061
It was every unknown
terror in the world,

22:40.431 --> 22:44.094
every fear fused into one
hideous night black horror.

22:47.338 --> 22:51.399
Still, whatever else had happened,
my brain was a man's brain,

22:52.176 --> 22:54.736
my intelligence still
a man's intelligence.

22:56.347 --> 22:57.541
An idea came to me.

22:57.615 --> 23:00.243
Did I wake you up?
No. No, it wasn't you.

23:00.918 --> 23:03.614
It was all the noise
you were making.

23:03.687 --> 23:06.281
Oh, sorry. This is
a real treat for me.

23:07.024 --> 23:09.720
Yeah. In the joint,
it's lights out at 9:00.

23:11.362 --> 23:12.852
"Paraguay"?

23:14.565 --> 23:16.430
You are obsessed,
aren't you?

23:20.304 --> 23:21.794
Is this
The Incredible Shrinking Man?

23:21.872 --> 23:22.896
Yeah.

23:22.973 --> 23:25.999
Dad used
to love this one.

23:26.076 --> 23:28.010
Oh, he still does,
I imagine.

23:31.715 --> 23:33.945
Have a seat.
Make yourself at home.

23:38.489 --> 23:42.084
I knew sooner or later it would
come charging down that web,

23:42.159 --> 23:44.389
skimming out
blackly toward me.

23:50.434 --> 23:51.799
Do you have to do that now?

23:51.869 --> 23:53.063
Yeah.

24:05.983 --> 24:07.507
Now we can relax.

24:11.088 --> 24:12.316
Popcorn?

24:13.924 --> 24:15.186
You put cinnamon on it?

24:15.259 --> 24:16.283
Mmm-hmm.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.918
I do that too!

24:22.866 --> 24:23.855
Jack.

24:23.934 --> 24:24.923
Yeah?

24:25.936 --> 24:28.632
Was he a good father?

24:29.673 --> 24:31.538
Look at us.
What do you think?

24:33.610 --> 24:36.340
Was he terrible?

24:37.281 --> 24:39.408
Look at us.
What do you think?

24:40.384 --> 24:42.352
We got robbed, brother.

24:44.355 --> 24:46.550
Are you still in
touch with him?

24:47.424 --> 24:51.053
No. Not since
I got busted.

24:51.895 --> 24:53.157
I mean...

24:53.997 --> 24:56.727
He didn't even bail me out.
Didn't come to court.

24:57.501 --> 25:00.061
He really hasn't been
the same since Mom died.

25:05.376 --> 25:07.367
Since who died?

25:07.444 --> 25:09.002
Since Mom died.

25:11.882 --> 25:13.907
Her hair.

25:15.152 --> 25:18.178
She dyed her hair.
It used to be strawberry blonde.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.382
Your mother is dead?

25:20.858 --> 25:22.826
Who was that woman
on the phone?

25:24.695 --> 25:27.528
I want an explanation, Jack,
and I want the truth.

25:27.598 --> 25:29.566
Okay. Uh, which one
do you want first?

25:29.633 --> 25:31.123
Who is she?

25:32.236 --> 25:33.464
Your girlfriend.

25:33.537 --> 25:37.371
Uh, no. Theresa? No.
No, she's like a friend with benefits.

25:39.576 --> 25:42.773
Okay, brother.
Half-bro. Half-bro.

25:43.647 --> 25:47.083
Leland? Leland.
It's me, Adrian Monk.

25:47.584 --> 25:50.553
Okay, listen.
Can you come over right away?

25:50.621 --> 25:52.714
Yes, it's extremely urgent.

25:53.457 --> 25:55.948
And, Cap,
bring your handcuffs.

25:58.787 --> 26:02.951
Adrian! You can't do that!
You can't send me back.

26:03.025 --> 26:04.014
I'm your brother!

26:04.092 --> 26:05.650
Half-brother.

26:05.727 --> 26:09.629
Adrian, I know,
I'm sorry, I lied.

26:09.698 --> 26:13.395
I'm sorry. It won't,
it won't happen again. Hand to God.

26:13.468 --> 26:18.235
Oh, put your hand down, Jack,
and get dressed. The Captain's on his way.

26:18.306 --> 26:21.104
Wait! No!
I'm on my knees!

26:21.510 --> 26:24.946
Your brother is in your kitchen,
and he's on his knees.

26:25.013 --> 26:26.207
Don't scuff up the floor.

26:26.281 --> 26:28.749
Oh! You're making
a big mistake!

26:28.817 --> 26:32.548
I already made a mistake when I
agreed to take you in. Actually,

26:33.555 --> 26:36.524
it was you who took me in.

26:36.591 --> 26:39.788
I was in trouble. I was scared.
You know what it's...

26:39.861 --> 26:41.920
Hey, you know what it's like being scared.

26:41.997 --> 26:43.021
You of all people!

26:43.098 --> 26:44.497
Just stop talking!

26:44.566 --> 26:46.295
Can you stop talking?
Okay.

26:46.368 --> 26:49.667
What is your problem?
Are you allergic to the truth?

26:49.738 --> 26:51.899
Yes, that's, I am,
I am! That's it!

26:51.973 --> 26:56.171
I'm a cheat, I'm a liar, okay?
That's who I am. I am

26:56.244 --> 26:58.735
as God made me.
But I am not a killer!

27:00.982 --> 27:02.381
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hang on!

27:02.451 --> 27:05.249
I didn't kill Lindsey Bishop,
and you know that.

27:05.320 --> 27:09.814
Now, if I go back to prison,
they know I did it, I am dead? Okay?

27:09.891 --> 27:12.655
You send me back there,
you'd be killing your own brother.

27:12.728 --> 27:13.854
Half-brother.

27:16.832 --> 27:18.766
Can you live with that?

27:20.235 --> 27:21.566
I live with worse.

27:23.572 --> 27:26.006
And stop saying
you're family.

27:26.074 --> 27:28.565
It doesn't mean anything,
especially from you.

27:28.643 --> 27:31.976
Oh, no. Now, Shiv is
going to be after me.

27:32.047 --> 27:33.446
I'm sure he is.

27:33.515 --> 27:34.846
Wait, Adrian, Adrian...

27:35.584 --> 27:37.950
Hey, whatever happens,

27:38.820 --> 27:42.119
you'll always be my...
My big brother.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.332
What the hell is going on?
Are you okay?

27:56.772 --> 27:59.297
Yeah. Sorry,
it was a false alarm.

28:00.675 --> 28:02.370
False alarm?
Yeah.

28:02.444 --> 28:05.174
I thought I heard a prowler,
and it was just Jack. I...

28:05.247 --> 28:06.908
I forgot he was
staying here.

28:07.449 --> 28:10.816
Wait. You forgot that you
had a houseguest? You?

28:18.527 --> 28:20.154
Are you crying?

28:21.797 --> 28:23.856
Yeah, a little.
I mean...

28:25.300 --> 28:29.100
How would you feel if your pen
pal thought you were a prowler?

28:33.775 --> 28:36.903
Okay. I'm going home.
If I can get back in bed in 20 minutes,

28:36.978 --> 28:39.242
there's a chance I won't
remember any of this.

28:39.815 --> 28:41.646
Yeah.
Oh. Uh, hey.

28:41.716 --> 28:44.048
The prisoner you were
asking about, the cellmate?

28:44.119 --> 28:45.381
Shiv Logan?
Yeah.

28:45.453 --> 28:47.216
Uh, you better start
knocking on a different door,

28:47.289 --> 28:50.122
because they just now found him
dead in the prison rec room.

28:50.192 --> 28:52.092
He was stabbed in
the neck with a shiv.

28:52.694 --> 28:54.753
Guy should have picked
a different nickname.

28:55.397 --> 28:57.865
Well, you kids have
fun. Nighty night.

29:08.343 --> 29:09.833
Hypothetically.

29:09.911 --> 29:10.935
Okay.

29:11.012 --> 29:15.472
Let's say,
somebody was a fugitive from the law

29:15.550 --> 29:19.281
and they needed help
and they came to you.

29:19.821 --> 29:21.083
A fugitive?

29:21.623 --> 29:24.319
Like the man who escaped from
Bayside Correctional? The...

29:24.392 --> 29:25.825
The one who murdered
that woman?

29:25.894 --> 29:28.385
Okay, let's say,
hypothetically,

29:30.332 --> 29:32.197
that it's not hypothetical.

29:34.302 --> 29:36.236
He's in my apartment.

29:36.304 --> 29:40.297
He's been there for two days.
It's my half-brother Jack.

29:40.375 --> 29:41.740
He's the fugitive.

29:43.178 --> 29:45.305
He's been using
a fake name.

29:46.448 --> 29:47.642
Did he kill that woman?

29:47.716 --> 29:50.207
No! I don't think he did.

29:50.819 --> 29:53.652
But he did escape from jail.
He's guilty of that.

29:53.722 --> 29:56.850
But he's going back,
as soon as I clear his name.

29:58.159 --> 30:03.222
All I ever wanted,
since I was a boy, was a real family.

30:05.834 --> 30:07.631
I used to pray for it.

30:10.605 --> 30:13.597
I hate to break the news to you, Adrian,
but you already have a real family.

30:13.675 --> 30:17.975
In a lot of ways, your situation is typical.
I've seen it quite often.

30:19.547 --> 30:23.039
There's a four-state dragnet out
on my brother. You get that a lot?

30:23.118 --> 30:26.144
No, no. These are
fundamental questions.

30:26.221 --> 30:29.748
People have been asking them for ages,
all the way back to Cain and Abel.

30:29.824 --> 30:33.988
"What do I owe my family? What do I
owe my brother? What is my obligation?"

30:34.596 --> 30:37.463
See, sometimes,
he's not really so bad.

30:37.999 --> 30:41.127
Last night,
we were watching this old horror movie and

30:41.202 --> 30:44.933
talking about our dad
and Paraguay...

30:45.440 --> 30:47.374
And I... I was feeling...
Paraguay?

30:47.909 --> 30:51.902
Yeah, he's obsessed with Paraguay.
He's been reading all about it...

30:51.980 --> 30:53.504
Uh-oh.

30:54.716 --> 30:56.274
Uh-oh? What, uh-oh?

30:56.351 --> 31:00.879
Adrian. I've been doing some
workshops in local prisons,

31:00.956 --> 31:03.948
and Paraguay is considered
the promised land.

31:05.226 --> 31:08.127
Really? Mmm-hmm.
Because of their new extradition laws.

31:08.196 --> 31:10.357
They won't extradite anyone.

31:11.232 --> 31:13.860
Unless he's been
indicted for murder.

31:19.007 --> 31:22.033
Yeah, you remember.
I bought that album.

31:22.110 --> 31:25.773
You know that most of that money didn't
even go to the children of Africa?

31:25.847 --> 31:28.577
But most of this money goes
directly to the orphans.

31:28.650 --> 31:31.016
It's like only 2 percent
goes to marketing.

31:31.086 --> 31:32.986
Which is probably
why I never heard of it.

31:33.054 --> 31:36.581
Exactly. That's why they call
it a word of mouth charity.

31:36.658 --> 31:38.216
Well, I wish I could
give you more.

31:38.293 --> 31:39.317
Oh, bless your heart.

31:39.394 --> 31:42.261
Um, so, I make
it out to you?

31:42.797 --> 31:44.788
Yeah. It's like a...

31:44.866 --> 31:48.097
Weird Canadian tax thing.
I don't even understand it myself.

31:48.169 --> 31:49.568
Where is he?

31:49.637 --> 31:53.038
Liar. You're a liar!
You were never going back to prison.

31:53.108 --> 31:54.234
Mr. Monk!

31:54.309 --> 31:56.903
You were going to Paraguay.
That's why you came to me!

31:56.978 --> 31:59.344
You couldn't leave until I cleared your name.

31:59.414 --> 32:01.609
Okay, look, Adrian,
I swear...

32:01.683 --> 32:03.742
Just admit it, Jack!

32:03.818 --> 32:07.276
Just... Can you
please, just once,

32:07.355 --> 32:09.118
just for the
novelty of it.

32:09.190 --> 32:12.284
Wait, I don't understand.
He's your pen pal, right?

32:12.360 --> 32:14.294
He's my half-brother.

32:15.163 --> 32:16.425
He's Jack, Jr.

32:16.498 --> 32:19.092
Oh, my God! Jack?

32:19.167 --> 32:21.931
AKA Joe Endicott.

32:22.404 --> 32:25.305
The fugitive?
Oh, my God!

32:25.607 --> 32:28.007
So... Oh, my God!

32:28.777 --> 32:30.802
But you killed that woman?
No!

32:30.879 --> 32:35.339
No, he's not a killer,
but he's practically everything else.

32:35.417 --> 32:37.647
God! I want
my check back.

32:37.719 --> 32:38.743
What? What is that?

32:38.820 --> 32:41.482
He said he's building
an orphanage in Quebec.

32:42.857 --> 32:47.760
Okay. You know what, I am relieved
that this happened. I really am.

32:47.829 --> 32:51.595
Let's talk about this.
No more BS. No more lies, okay?

32:51.666 --> 32:54.362
Hand to God.
God doesn't want to see your hand.

32:56.004 --> 32:57.232
What is that?

32:58.640 --> 32:59.629
What?

33:00.742 --> 33:04.075
That watch.
I've seen it before.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.678
In Lindsey Bishop's
apartment.

33:14.756 --> 33:16.417
You stole that watch!

33:17.158 --> 33:20.286
They haven't even buried her yet,
and you're wearing her watch?

33:20.361 --> 33:23.660
Oh, my God! Okay, first off,
it wasn't her watch.

33:23.731 --> 33:27.326
So it doesn't count.
It's a guy's watch, okay? Here, look.

33:28.169 --> 33:30.069
Take it back.
It's not even my style.

33:30.138 --> 33:33.403
You are the most selfish
human being on the planet.

33:33.475 --> 33:36.342
You don't care about
anyone or anything...

33:46.855 --> 33:47.879
Is he okay?

33:47.956 --> 33:49.719
He just solved
the case.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.684
Why don't you
hang back here?

34:20.425 --> 34:21.790
When were you
going to tell me?

34:21.860 --> 34:22.952
What year is it?

34:23.027 --> 34:24.052
Mr. Monk.

34:24.129 --> 34:27.063
Natalie, I was harboring a fugitive.
I was trying to keep you out of it.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.498
Yeah, but see, we're partners.
You're supposed to trust me.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.503
I couldn't trust him.
That was the problem. I still don't.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.800
Ah, Mr. Reese.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.831
My name is Adrian Monk.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.739
I remember you.
The consultant.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.643
That's right. You remember
my assistant, Natalie,

34:41.713 --> 34:44.876
and, uh, Jack,
my pen pal.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.818
Yeah, the pen pal.
What can I do for you?

34:47.886 --> 34:52.118
Uh, well, we think that Lindsey
Bishop had a fornication partner.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.681
We found this wristwatch
in her apartment.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.927
A fornication partner?
Yeah, it's...

34:57.996 --> 35:00.123
It's a man's watch,
and it's engraved,

35:00.732 --> 35:02.427
"L.B. To D.R."

35:03.268 --> 35:06.237
It's not mine.
Must be a dozen D.R.'s working at the prison.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.598
Only three, actually.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.506
So you got
two more to go.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.673
Did you ever see Ms. Bishop outside of work?

35:15.747 --> 35:16.941
No, ma'am, I did not.

35:17.015 --> 35:20.178
I have a wife and kid,
and I'm trying to hang on to both.

35:20.252 --> 35:23.551
How do you know this fornication
partner even works at the prison?

35:23.622 --> 35:26.216
We assumed because...
That's a good point.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.592
We should keep looking.
Well, that's it, I guess.

35:30.161 --> 35:32.288
Sorry to bother you.
Thanks again.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.729
He's the guy. Just keep walking.
Don't look back.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.824
Well, there are two other
names... No, no, no, no, no.

35:36.901 --> 35:39.096
The spoon in his hand
was sterling silver.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.900
Has the same lettering as the
one that killed Lindsey Bishop.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.067
Are you sure?
I'm 80 percent sure he's the guy.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.076
I'm 95 percent sure!

35:57.355 --> 35:58.447
Oh, my God!

35:58.523 --> 35:59.751
Are you okay?
Yeah.

36:00.725 --> 36:02.556
Where's your cell phone?
In my purse.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.652
Thank God!
Which is in the car.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.795
Hey, that's my gun!
What?

36:10.869 --> 36:13.633
Oh, yeah. No, I borrowed it.
And be glad I did.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.677
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

36:22.747 --> 36:25.648
Reese and Lindsey Bishop
were having an affair.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.844
They were
the fornicators!

36:28.620 --> 36:30.110
Things must
have gone bad.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.418
Maybe she threatened
to tell his wife.

36:32.490 --> 36:33.889
All we know
for sure...

36:33.958 --> 36:35.016
Oh, God!

36:35.093 --> 36:36.754
He wanted her gone.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.853
It was a setup
from the beginning.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.727
He was going to
kill his mistress

36:40.799 --> 36:43.495
and make it look like an
inmate did it during an escape.

36:43.568 --> 36:46.036
JACK, JR: Yeah, he went to Shiv.
It was the perfect choice.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.366
The guy's a real moron.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.999
It worked,
Shiv took the bait.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.237
Reese told Shiv

36:54.312 --> 36:56.075
how to go,
where to go,

36:56.147 --> 36:58.877
and most importantly,
when to go.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.680
It had to be Monday night at 3:00.

37:07.759 --> 37:11.593
That night,
he killed Lindsey Bishop in the parking lot,

37:12.063 --> 37:14.361
then he reported for duty,

37:14.432 --> 37:17.731
took his position in the
guard tower and waited.

37:23.875 --> 37:27.504
He expected Shiv to be
climbing out any minute.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.780
He didn't know that Jack Monk,
Jr. Had other ideas.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.477
It wasn't exactly how
Reese planned it.

37:34.552 --> 37:37.146
But he didn't care.
One patsy's as good as another.

37:53.204 --> 37:56.401
I'm out! Oh, God.
Oh, God, oh, God!

38:00.712 --> 38:03.010
He stopped. He stopped.
Did you get him?

38:03.081 --> 38:04.571
Well, I don't know.

38:04.649 --> 38:05.673
Hold on.

38:05.750 --> 38:06.978
No, Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.384
Quick, go, go!
Come on!

38:14.159 --> 38:16.024
Come on! We have
to get to my purse!

38:17.829 --> 38:19.820
I'll go.
I'll go.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.731
No, I'll go! You stay!
I want to do it!

38:22.801 --> 38:24.200
Are you sure?

38:27.839 --> 38:29.636
You were wrong
about me, brother!

38:30.775 --> 38:32.538
Throw me the keys!
Keys.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.202
Oh, God,
oh, God!

38:35.513 --> 38:37.174
Sorry.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.458
He made it!

38:53.298 --> 38:55.766
He's backing up.
Mr. Monk, he's backing up.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.665
Wait!

38:58.937 --> 39:00.461
Where is he going?

39:00.538 --> 39:03.871
Paraguay.
The most beautiful women in the world.

39:04.242 --> 39:06.904
No. Mr. Monk.
Here he comes.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.106
Oh, no, what do we do?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.011
Okay. Okay.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.415
I'm going to count to three.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.316
Okay. Yes, okay.

39:15.386 --> 39:16.648
On three,

39:17.555 --> 39:19.352
you come up
with a great idea.

39:41.579 --> 39:44.070
Paraguay
is that way.

39:44.782 --> 39:46.147
The beautiful women.

39:52.874 --> 39:54.398
Good deal, thank you.

39:54.976 --> 39:58.309
That was the DA.
He says that Reese is awake

39:58.379 --> 40:02.008
and pouring his heart out.
We got him on Lindsey Bishop and Shiv Logan.

40:02.517 --> 40:03.745
What about Jack?

40:04.218 --> 40:07.381
Well, he did escape, so they're gonna
add a little time to his sentence.

40:09.357 --> 40:10.824
He wanted to
say goodbye.

40:11.592 --> 40:13.059
Figured he was
family, right?

40:13.127 --> 40:14.560
Yeah. He's...

40:14.962 --> 40:16.293
He's family.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.859
It's almost worth it,
hearing you say that.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.527
Hey, uh, Bayside
Correctional is only

40:21.602 --> 40:24.469
like an hour away.
Maybe you could come up sometime.

40:24.539 --> 40:27.133
Yeah, I could do that.
Maybe one day.

40:30.311 --> 40:32.074
All right, Jack,
time to go.

40:33.848 --> 40:34.906
See you.

40:34.982 --> 40:36.142
Jack.

40:36.551 --> 40:40.317
Listen, I just wanted to say
I'm proud of what you did.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.348
And I'm proud
you're my brother.

40:45.226 --> 40:46.989
You mean half-brother.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.621
I'm rounding up.

40:55.737 --> 40:59.298
Excuse me.
I'm just going to sneak in here. Sorry.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.613
Thank you.

41:21.662 --> 41:22.788
Jack.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.008
What are you
looking for?

41:43.084 --> 41:44.073
Oh.

41:45.019 --> 41:47.852
I think I left my handcuff
keys in my other coat.
