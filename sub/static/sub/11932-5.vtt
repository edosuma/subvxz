00:26.594 --> 00:30.394
Now, shithead. Give me your money.
Please, I'd really rather not.

00:30.434 --> 00:32.155
Give me your money, or I'll knife
you.

00:32.195 --> 00:34.234
Well, obviously, when you put
it like that.

00:34.274 --> 00:36.354
And the rest of you. Come on.

00:36.395 --> 00:39.594
I've only really got this.  Yeah. You
can keep that.

00:39.634 --> 00:42.994
And that's all I've got. I'm so sorry.
Don't apologise. He's mugging you.

00:43.034 --> 00:46.475
I know. I'm saying I just spent it all
on these shoes. So give me your shoes.

00:46.515 --> 00:49.795
Oh, no. Please. They won't fit you.
I've got surprisingly dainty feet.

00:49.835 --> 00:52.594
Shoes, now. All of you.

00:52.634 --> 00:55.994
And I'll have your necklace, as
well.  Fuck you, you piece of shit.

00:56.034 --> 00:58.594
Yeah. Don't call the armed mugger
rude names, probably.

00:58.634 --> 01:00.634
Listen to your boyfriend, love.

01:00.674 --> 01:03.354
Now give me that necklace, or I'll
cut his dick off.

01:03.395 --> 01:05.555
Of course he won't.  You sure about
that?

01:05.594 --> 01:08.394
Just give him the necklace now.
Please, Delphine.

01:09.394 --> 01:11.474
Cheers, Delphine.  Thank you.

01:13.754 --> 01:17.075
Nah, you can keep them too.  Magic.

01:33.754 --> 01:37.075
I lost my money, my shoes, and
Delphine's respect in one go.

01:37.115 --> 01:40.515
At least he didn't cut your penis
off.  He may as well have done.

01:40.555 --> 01:44.155
She wouldn't even touch me last night.
Classic animal behaviour, innit?

01:44.194 --> 01:46.349
She's seen her male get
out-antlered by another stag

01:46.549 --> 01:48.155
and no longer wants to
mate with him.

01:48.194 --> 01:51.194
But I want to mate with HER. This is
the best mating I've ever had.

01:51.234 --> 01:53.754
Then you need to show her that
you're the alpha male.

01:53.795 --> 01:57.395
Spread your wings. Get your talons
out.  Talons? I thought I was a stag.

01:57.435 --> 01:59.835
Well, you're more of an eagle. Cos
of the beak.

01:59.875 --> 02:02.034
Oh, cheers. Kick me when I'm down.

02:02.075 --> 02:04.555
All right, Agatha?  Hiya, Grumie.

02:04.594 --> 02:07.995
I was hoping you'd come by. I made a
new orange and almond cake.

02:08.033 --> 02:11.435
Yes, please.  Or maybe "no, please",
Grumio.

02:11.474 --> 02:14.354
We need the money for shoes. Don't
worry, it's on the house.

02:14.395 --> 02:18.435
Is it? Why? I'm sort of like Agatha's
taste consultant.

02:18.474 --> 02:21.235
He's got such a refined palate.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.275
It could do with a squeeze more
orange, a few less almonds,

02:24.314 --> 02:26.715
and being a much bigger cake.

02:26.754 --> 02:29.074
And you must try some flapjack.

02:29.115 --> 02:32.435
Hey. Check this out. 'Roman Military
Fitness.

02:32.474 --> 02:35.275
Get in shape and learn to fight with
genuine ex-soldier.'

02:35.314 --> 02:38.715
Maybe we should do this.  I think I'd
rather learn Persian folk dancing.

02:38.754 --> 02:42.155
We'd never get mugged again.
If anything, we'd be doing the mugging.

02:42.194 --> 02:43.361
Not sure that's the idea.

02:43.562 --> 02:46.875
And you can show Delphine that you're
the biggest bull in the barnyard.

02:46.914 --> 02:49.795
Get her ready for mating season.
What do you reckon, G-Man?

02:49.835 --> 02:52.514
I reckon this flapjack is
fan-flapping-tastic.

02:54.354 --> 02:57.514
Plenty more where that came from.  Is
there?

02:59.754 --> 03:02.034
I always assumed Grumio was fully
asexual.

03:02.074 --> 03:04.235
Like a monk. Or a plate.

03:04.275 --> 03:06.275
The guy's getting his oats, man.

03:06.314 --> 03:09.594
And not just from her flapjacks. You
know what I'm saying?

03:09.634 --> 03:11.634
What's with the queue?

03:11.675 --> 03:16.194
It's new security measures cos of
this crime wave. Absolutely typical.

03:16.235 --> 03:20.555
Oh, bloody hell. I know. The one day I
bring in my longbow and this happens.

03:20.594 --> 03:23.594
Longbow? Why have you got that?

03:23.634 --> 03:26.594
To ward off muggers, obviously.
What? From miles away?

03:26.634 --> 03:30.514
I can still fire it up close.  Course
you can't. Look.  I can.

03:34.074 --> 03:36.115
Or I can bonk people with the bow.

03:36.155 --> 03:38.155
Oh!  There. Warded off.

03:44.795 --> 03:46.795
OK. You're clean.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.795
These are the new security measures?
You frisking people?

03:49.835 --> 03:52.914
Not all people. I don't need to do
you. Or you, water boy.

03:52.954 --> 03:54.954
What about me?  Well, obviously not.

03:54.995 --> 03:57.235
You're hardly likely to pose a
threat.

03:57.275 --> 04:01.995
It's gonna be young, athletic
ne'er-do-wells like...oh, shredder.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.099
How is he getting frisked
and not me?

04:04.300 --> 04:06.995
I've got a longbow for Jove's sake.
Water man.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.034
Yes. I'll take that, thank you.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.754
Right, you. Spread 'em.

04:17.194 --> 04:19.314
It's full of middle-aged women.
Look.

04:19.355 --> 04:23.675
Yeah. This really isn't for us.  No,
come on. It'll be good.

04:23.714 --> 04:25.625
We can learn how to
protect ourselves.

04:25.826 --> 04:27.995
You know how to protect
yourself, Marcus.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.795
When in danger, you just give away
my jewellery.

04:30.834 --> 04:34.194
OK. Shush, please, ladies.

04:34.235 --> 04:38.954
Welcome. My name is Hector and I'll
be teaching you self-defence.

04:38.995 --> 04:43.235
The streets are full of predators,
many of them sexual.

04:43.274 --> 04:46.595
And a gorgeous bunch like you will
of course be prime targets.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.355
Not you, to be fair.

04:49.394 --> 04:51.435
Just a bit of banter.

04:51.475 --> 04:54.074
This class will also include
military fitness.

04:54.115 --> 04:57.074
If you don't know what military is,
it means army.

04:57.115 --> 04:59.595
Which I was in. The Third Legion of.

04:59.634 --> 05:03.274
OK. Let's get the blood flowing
first. Shake it down now, girls.

05:03.314 --> 05:07.555
Yeah. First up, we're gonna learn
the nose-slam.

05:07.595 --> 05:12.274
This little beauty saved my arse many
times at the Battle of Philippi.

05:12.314 --> 05:15.154
OK. Volunteer time. One of the
fellas, maybe?

05:15.194 --> 05:18.595
Yes, please. The big man with the
muscles. Come on.

05:18.634 --> 05:21.555
Er, yep. Sure thing. The rest of you,
buddy up.

05:21.595 --> 05:23.995
So if Muscles here is this
attacker...

05:24.035 --> 05:27.035
And let's pretend he's a lot bigger,
make it realistic.

05:27.074 --> 05:29.074
More banter, Muscles.

05:29.115 --> 05:32.355
Imagine he comes in with a
right-hand jab. Yes please, big man.

05:32.394 --> 05:35.995
Left arm parry, right hand flat,
crunching into the nose.

05:36.034 --> 05:39.715
Keep practising and it will become
muscle memory.

05:39.754 --> 05:41.995
Get it into your muscles.

05:42.034 --> 05:45.355
Right, Muscles? OK. Once again,
please. Bit faster.

05:45.394 --> 05:49.435
Parry. Nose-slap. Left arm round the
back of the neck into a chokehold.

05:49.475 --> 05:53.355
From here, we can break the neck or
rapid punch the bonce.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.514
Where would you rather, muscle  man?
Neither, please.

05:57.034 --> 05:59.074
I dunno why you're blubbing,
Muscles.

05:59.115 --> 06:02.795
I'm not even doing it properly. This
shouldn't even be hurting.

06:04.714 --> 06:08.634
Salve, Grumio. All right, landlord?
All right, Davus?

06:08.675 --> 06:13.634
Your rent's overdue. I know. We got
mugged by some scumbag last night.

06:13.675 --> 06:17.194
Should've taken advantage of our
crimewave protection deal.

06:17.235 --> 06:19.274
What's the deal?

06:19.314 --> 06:22.555
For a mere 30 denarii, Davus here
will offer you protection

06:22.595 --> 06:26.954
from all those violent thugs out
there. Including, of course, himself.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.995
Wicked. Bang it on the rent, eh?

06:29.035 --> 06:32.314
Hi, Grumie.  Agatha. What are you
doing here?

06:32.355 --> 06:35.154
Special delivery. I made you a cake.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.475
Oh, yeah. I should try some of that.

06:37.514 --> 06:41.074
You know, check it's not poisoned.
I've got a protection deal.

06:41.115 --> 06:44.675
It's a strawberry and walnut sponge
with a honey glaze.

06:44.715 --> 06:47.115
Mmm. I should check it too,
actually.

06:47.154 --> 06:51.235
I'll take my chances, thanks.  Well,
I hope you like it.

07:00.555 --> 07:03.394
Maybe you're right. It's not really
for us.

07:03.435 --> 07:06.795
Are you kidding? I loved it. We're
going to get so fit.

07:06.834 --> 07:10.355
Parry. Nose-slam. Stay down.  There
are other ways to get fit.

07:10.394 --> 07:13.475
We could learn Persian folk dancing,
for example.

07:13.514 --> 07:16.675
Because the big man picked on you?
What? That?

07:16.714 --> 07:19.274
That was just banter. He was messing
around.

07:19.314 --> 07:23.435
When you were squealing like a pig
in a box, that was banter, was it?

07:23.475 --> 07:26.274
Yeah. Pretty niche banter,
admittedly, but you know.

07:26.314 --> 07:30.235
Sorry. Where are you going? Home. I'm
kind of pooped after that.

07:30.274 --> 07:33.954
OK. Want me to escort you? Cos of the
crime wave and stuff.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.115
Yeah, right.

07:40.314 --> 07:42.314
She's never gonna mate with me again.

07:42.355 --> 07:45.115
You shouldn't have pitted yourself
against the alpha male.

07:45.154 --> 07:47.954
You pitted me against the alpha male.
The class was your idea.

07:47.995 --> 07:50.533
I'll be better off taking
romantic advice from Grumio.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.074
Any time you like, brother.

07:52.115 --> 07:54.721
This baker must be really into you,
judging by the cake.

07:54.922 --> 07:56.154
Why? Cos it's strawberry?

07:56.194 --> 07:58.194
Cos it's heart-shaped, you div.

07:58.235 --> 08:00.514
Oh, yeah. I hadn't spotted that.

08:00.555 --> 08:03.355
Why do all confident men feel the
need to dominate me?

08:03.394 --> 08:05.754
It's Mr Tappo's PE class all over
again.

08:05.795 --> 08:08.714
You need to fight back. Show Hector
you're not to be trifled with.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.074
But I am. Clearly I am to be trifled
with.

08:11.115 --> 08:14.355
So fight dirty. Bop him in his
balls. Chuck sand in his eyes.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.555
Or I could just hide behind the fat
kids, like I did in PE.

08:17.595 --> 08:19.595
Proper moist.

08:25.834 --> 08:29.675
Honestly, there's nothing up there.
Well, you can never be too careful.

08:29.714 --> 08:31.714
From my point of view, you really
can.

08:31.754 --> 08:34.315
Ah. And...

08:37.955 --> 08:41.914
OK. You are clean.  Right. I don't
feel it.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.315
Er, yes. You, come forward.

08:45.355 --> 08:48.715
Thank you. And spread 'em. Copier,
water boy, you can go through.

08:48.754 --> 08:51.955
Right. Thank you. Oh, yeah. I see.
It's outrageous. Water man.

08:51.995 --> 08:55.355
You're clearly profiling us and only
frisking the hot ones.  How dare you.

08:55.394 --> 08:59.475
My selection process is entirely random.
I demand to get searched right now,

08:59.514 --> 09:02.875
or I'll file for discrimination.  OK.
Come on, then.

09:04.115 --> 09:06.154
Spread 'em.

09:13.394 --> 09:17.914
It was horrible. I feel brutalised.
It was just a slightly gropey pat down.

09:17.955 --> 09:19.955
She encircled my member.

09:19.995 --> 09:23.355
She's a very frisky frisker. What do
you expect? We could sue for this.

09:23.394 --> 09:26.394
Touching a staff member's member is
sexual assault.

09:26.434 --> 09:30.095
I know someone who got a payout of 3,000
denarii after something like this.

09:30.294 --> 09:31.235
Three grand? Yeah.

09:31.274 --> 09:34.835
Did she touch your member? Mate, she
was all over my staff member.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.075
And my balls.
In fact, now that I think about it,

09:37.274 --> 09:39.154
I'm starting to feel
pretty traumatised.

09:39.195 --> 09:43.274
You see? Like I've received about
three grand's worth of sexual assault.

09:48.514 --> 09:51.235
Would you like to lick the bowl?
Yes, please.

09:53.315 --> 09:56.235
What about the spoon?  I'll lick the
lot, mate.

09:57.674 --> 09:59.754
Oh. It's like that, is it?

10:00.995 --> 10:02.995
Come on, then. I'll eat you alive.

10:14.075 --> 10:16.075
Things going well with Agatha, then?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.154
It's delicious.

10:18.195 --> 10:21.595
Not quite what I asked. Course they
are, it's a match made in heaven.

10:21.634 --> 10:23.995
She's happy baking. I'm happy
eating.

10:24.034 --> 10:28.154
Right. And I don't want to put a
downer on what is clearly true love,

10:28.195 --> 10:32.075
but you don't think she might be a
feeder, do you?

10:32.115 --> 10:35.434
Oh, shit. Never thought of that.
Well, she does feed me, so.

10:35.475 --> 10:39.554
But as in, she likes turning her
boyfriends into big, cakey fatties.

10:39.595 --> 10:42.835
Well, let's hope so, eh?

10:44.914 --> 10:49.034
Keep slamming those noses and it
will become instinctive.

10:49.075 --> 10:51.674
Parry. Nose-slam.  OK, volunteer
time.

10:51.715 --> 10:53.715
I need someone to take me on.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.794
Yes, please. Muscles.

10:56.835 --> 10:59.674
No thanks, Hector.

10:59.715 --> 11:02.434
What? Scared you'll hurt me, are
you?

11:02.475 --> 11:05.595
No. Just wanna give someone else a
go. I'll do it, Hector.

11:05.634 --> 11:09.115
Thanks. Thank you. Rescued by his
girlfriend. What a gentleman.

11:09.154 --> 11:11.475
All right. Step forward then,
please, my darling.

11:11.514 --> 11:14.595
Today we're gonna do some sexual
assault roleplays.

11:14.634 --> 11:17.394
If you turn around, I'm gonna try
and goose you,

11:17.434 --> 11:20.554
and you're gonna beat me off.
Actually, I will do it. It's OK.

11:20.595 --> 11:23.067
Changed my mind.
He's not actually going to goose me.

11:23.268 --> 11:25.075
I know. It's just I'm happy to do it.

11:25.115 --> 11:27.634
And he did ask for me, so. All
right.

11:27.674 --> 11:30.674
What's good for the goose is good
for the gander.

11:30.715 --> 11:33.674
Right. So here's the deal. I'm
coming in for a goosing.

11:33.715 --> 11:36.115
What do you do?  Run away?

11:36.154 --> 11:39.394
Run away! What is this? A wild goose
chase?

11:41.315 --> 11:44.075
No. You deploy the chicken thrust.

11:44.115 --> 11:46.434
Use those whopping great arms of
yours.

11:46.475 --> 11:48.955
I'll demonstrate. Try and goose me.

11:49.955 --> 11:52.475
Chicken thrust! Bam, bam, bam, bam!
Oh, shit!

11:52.514 --> 11:55.315
Or version two. Come at me again,
please, Muscles.

11:57.154 --> 11:59.355
In your own time, big dog.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.235
OK. And I've neutralised him.

12:04.274 --> 12:06.274
Now he's on the deck, we can pin him
down.

12:06.315 --> 12:08.315
And if there's gas in the tank...

12:10.394 --> 12:13.995
..guff on the face. We used this all
the time in the Third Legion.

12:21.212 --> 12:23.332
That guy should not be allowed to
teach.

12:23.373 --> 12:26.452
He's an aggressive arsehole with an
aggressive arsehole.

12:26.493 --> 12:28.326
As if they teach farting in the army.

12:28.527 --> 12:31.253
I don't believe a word he says.
The guy's full of shit.

12:31.293 --> 12:34.852
Certainly smelled like it. I do wish
I could guff on command, though.

12:34.893 --> 12:37.932
That is well impressive.  Not really.
I can do that.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.533
The trick is not following through.
OK. Wicked.

12:42.572 --> 12:44.572
Delphine could barely watch.

12:44.613 --> 12:47.533
She's gonna dump me before I can get
the stench out of my hair.

12:47.572 --> 12:49.732
That's what you get for joining a
fitness class.

12:49.773 --> 12:52.052
Should've stayed here with me and
the cakes.

12:52.092 --> 12:56.293
Do you think you might have a bit of a cake
problem? No. I can stop when I want to.

12:56.332 --> 12:58.332
Go on, then.

12:58.373 --> 13:01.893
I don't want to.  You are a bit of a
flubster around the face.

13:01.932 --> 13:04.133
That's muscle from all the chewing.

13:06.212 --> 13:09.812
I did it!  Sweet.  Oh, yeah. I
followed through.

13:22.773 --> 13:26.013
Mini cupcake?  Give me a sec, I've
just put one in.

13:26.052 --> 13:29.293
They're only mini. You're meant to
eat two at a time.

13:29.332 --> 13:32.253
Max, is that you?

13:32.293 --> 13:34.932
Agatha! Wow. Good to see you!

13:34.972 --> 13:39.092
I didn't know you were in Rome. Yeah.
Doing private security now, ain't I?

13:39.133 --> 13:41.812
Thank fuck for this crime wave. You
know what I mean?

13:41.852 --> 13:45.732
All right, mate?  All right?  This is
Grumio, my new boyfriend.

13:45.773 --> 13:47.893
Yeah, I can tell. His mouth's full
of cake.

13:47.932 --> 13:51.413
I've got a whole box if you want
one.

13:51.452 --> 13:54.852
Nah, you're all right. I should be
getting back to work.  OK.

13:54.893 --> 13:58.773
Well, good to see you, Max.  Yeah.
You too.

13:58.812 --> 14:00.812
Good luck, fella.

14:01.732 --> 14:04.972
He an ex of yours, was he?  Years
back, yeah.

14:05.013 --> 14:07.932
He looks awful now he's lost all
that weight.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.212
This one's lemon drizzle.

14:14.452 --> 14:17.533
What's this? What in Hades do you
call this?

14:17.572 --> 14:19.572
"Sexual assault"?  That's right.

14:19.613 --> 14:23.572
You wouldn't know sexual assault if it
bent you over and bit you on the bum.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.373
Which, for the record, I
did not do.

14:26.413 --> 14:28.972
Sorry. Who is that?  It's my lawyer.
Ah.

14:29.013 --> 14:32.332
He's here to swat away pesky little
parasites like you.

14:32.373 --> 14:36.332
Well, we both found your frisking
style very traumatic, actually.

14:36.373 --> 14:39.452
Oh, what rot.  You violated us and
you know it.

14:39.493 --> 14:42.013
And you were asking for it.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.413
No, he was. He literally asked me to
do it.

14:44.452 --> 14:47.732
Let's just see what the tribunal has
to say about it, shall we?

14:47.773 --> 14:51.572
Oh, bring it on. Many have tried to
pin me for sexual assault,

14:51.613 --> 14:53.613
and every time I've wriggled free.

14:53.653 --> 14:56.332
Because I am feared around these
parts,

14:56.373 --> 14:59.572
and my word goes a very long way.

15:01.653 --> 15:04.212
And because I didn't do it...also.

15:07.452 --> 15:10.972
She was shaking in her shoes, man.
We've as good as won it.

15:11.013 --> 15:13.653
And then we can get a new flat, some
new threads,

15:13.692 --> 15:16.332
a trolley to wheel around the muffin
man here.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.373
I'm on a break from cake, as it
goes.

15:18.413 --> 15:22.013
What's that in your hand, then?
Carrot cake. It's basically salad.

15:22.052 --> 15:25.212
That's pretty much the definition of
having your cake and eating it.

15:25.253 --> 15:26.677
Agatha says it's good for me.

15:26.876 --> 15:29.332
Because she wants you to
be as big as a big house.

15:29.373 --> 15:33.092
You don't think there's anything
weird about this, G-Man?  I suppose.

15:33.133 --> 15:36.133
I did bump into one of her
ex-boyfriends earlier.  And?

15:36.173 --> 15:38.173
And there were a lot of him.

15:38.212 --> 15:41.373
And apparently when they were going
out, there were a lot more.

15:41.413 --> 15:43.613
It's probably nothing, though, eh?

15:46.692 --> 15:49.212
You've gotta get away from her.
She's a menace.

15:49.253 --> 15:50.251
What did we tell you?

15:50.451 --> 15:53.972
She'll keep stuffing you with cakes
till you can't move or get out of bed.

15:54.013 --> 15:56.332
Keep talking.  No, Grumio. You don't
want this.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.114
You'll be utterly helpless.
She'll do everything for you.

15:59.313 --> 16:00.732
While you lay there, eating.

16:00.773 --> 16:04.173
Still waiting for the bad news. You'll
have to wash with a wet rag. Fine.

16:04.212 --> 16:06.452
Pee in a pot by the bed.  I do that
anyway.

16:06.493 --> 16:08.493
You'll be dead by the time you're
40.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.653
Oh. There's always a catch.

16:10.692 --> 16:14.173
Listen, I know it's tough, but you
gotta say no to her cakes.

16:14.212 --> 16:16.373
Go cold turkey before it ruins you.

16:16.413 --> 16:19.413
Believe it or not, I was once the
fittest guy in my platoon.

16:19.452 --> 16:22.133
I had a six-pack and everything.  You
were a solider?

16:22.173 --> 16:25.413
Commanding centurion in the Third
Legion.  Third Legion.

16:25.452 --> 16:29.293
Don't suppose you ever served with
someone called Hector by any chance?

16:29.332 --> 16:31.893
Yeah I did, actually.

16:31.932 --> 16:35.212
Maybe he is a war hero.  Hero? Are
you pulling my plonker?

16:35.253 --> 16:37.932
Er, no. Not deliberately.  He's a
total coward.

16:37.972 --> 16:40.133
He nearly got us all killed in
Philippi.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.653
Came out of formation and let the
bloody enemy in

16:42.692 --> 16:44.932
while he crawled off under his
shield, the prick.

16:44.972 --> 16:48.293
And I'd say that right to his shit
face if I ever got the chance.

16:48.332 --> 16:50.932
Huh. Interesting.

16:52.253 --> 16:54.533
And then she worked her way up my
rear thigh.

16:54.572 --> 16:56.613
Checking for concealed weapons, yes.

16:56.653 --> 17:00.452
Up to the bum zone and anus area,

17:00.493 --> 17:03.893
giving me a firm probe and then a
thumb up.

17:03.932 --> 17:06.613
Sorry. Do you mean she gave you the
thumbs-up? Or -

17:06.653 --> 17:09.771
No. I mean she placed her
thumb...up.

17:09.813 --> 17:12.732
Oh, for Jove's sake. I'm not a
trained security guard.

17:12.771 --> 17:14.519
If the company
refused to hire people,

17:14.720 --> 17:16.893
then I have to take
things into my own hands.

17:16.932 --> 17:20.373
Can you show us on the dolly where
she touched you? Yes.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.133
Right. OK.

17:25.173 --> 17:28.692
We now have Stylax Eurysaces to
testify.

17:29.573 --> 17:33.173
All right?  In your own time, Stylax,
tell us what happened, please.

17:33.212 --> 17:36.732
Flavia started patting me down on my
arms, legs, nipples and stuff.

17:36.772 --> 17:40.093
Yes. Rightly so.  Then she began to
work the frontal groin.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.893
Poking it about a bit.  Poking it
how?

17:42.932 --> 17:46.532
Like you might if you were checking
a mango to see if it's ripe.

17:46.573 --> 17:48.972
A mango? Hardly.

17:49.012 --> 17:51.532
Can you show us on the dolly? Oh,
yeah.

17:51.573 --> 17:55.333
Oh, not really. The goolies are a
bit small on this one.

17:55.373 --> 17:57.573
They were too small for me as well.
For the record.

17:57.613 --> 18:00.173
OK. Do we have a life-size model
anywhere?

18:00.212 --> 18:02.853
Yes. I do.

18:02.893 --> 18:05.252
I confiscated that. It's not mine.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.613
Oh, OK. It was a bit like this.

18:15.972 --> 18:18.333
Because I thought it was a weapon.

18:18.373 --> 18:22.093
OK. I think we all need a bit of a
break after that.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.972
Let's pick it up again tomorrow,
please, people.

18:26.492 --> 18:30.212
Oh. Boys, boys. Quick
word before you go.

18:30.252 --> 18:32.772
OK. How much?  How much for what?

18:32.813 --> 18:35.133
To settle this right now. How much?

18:35.173 --> 18:38.012
It's not about money, as a matter of
fact. It's about justice.

18:38.052 --> 18:40.732
I'll give you 500 each.  Oh, yeah.
OK, I'll do that.

18:40.772 --> 18:44.292
What? No! We're gonna get three
grand. We're not taking 500 now.

18:44.333 --> 18:48.052
You're just scared you're gonna
lose.  No. That is a good offer.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.373
Well, your luck's run out this time.
Everyone's finally gonna know

18:51.413 --> 18:55.252
that you're a sneaky old sleaze.
What? Old!?

18:55.732 --> 18:57.732
Parry! Nose-slap!

19:01.252 --> 19:04.772
Well, now. This changes things.

19:04.813 --> 19:08.452
Apparently, the nose-slap pretty
much cancels out the groin grope,

19:08.492 --> 19:11.853
so we've called it quits.  You
nose-slammed Flavia? Bloody hell.

19:11.893 --> 19:15.772
It was muscle memory, man. These things
remember way more than my head does.

19:15.813 --> 19:18.252
Hi, guys.  Oh, hey.  Sex attack!

19:18.292 --> 19:22.173
Roman arm-twister!  Ah, no! Not a sex
attack. You're my girlfriend.

19:22.212 --> 19:25.972
That's one of Hector's. Good, right?
Yeah. Brilliant.

19:26.012 --> 19:28.373
Isn't Hector just great? What a great
guy.

19:28.413 --> 19:30.932
OK. Afternoon, ladies.

19:30.972 --> 19:33.532
Today, we're gonna learn about
frontal attacks.

19:33.573 --> 19:38.373
When predators go for the torso. And
when I say torso, I do mean tits.

19:39.813 --> 19:43.173
Volunteer time. Muscles, you're a
tit. Up you come.

19:43.212 --> 19:45.212
Sure thing, Hector.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.692
Now try and grab my nawks and I'll
demonstrate the Spartan strike.

19:48.732 --> 19:52.692
Sure. So this is another military move?
Oh, yeah. Used this all the time.

19:52.732 --> 19:55.853
Took out shitloads of enemy scum at
Philippi with this baby.

19:55.893 --> 19:58.045
Wow. Amazing.
Cos I actually met someone

19:58.244 --> 20:00.893
who fought with you at
Philippi just yesterday.

20:00.932 --> 20:03.012
What? Really? Yeah.

20:03.053 --> 20:06.492
I told him what you said and he had,
well, a couple of quibbles.

20:06.532 --> 20:10.012
Well, I may not remember everything
perfectly but -  Well, let's ask him.

20:10.053 --> 20:12.692
Maximus? Oh, shit. OK -

20:12.732 --> 20:15.133
You're not a war hero, you lying
arsehole.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.613
You're a dirty coward.  Dirty, dirty,
coward.

20:17.653 --> 20:22.012
You make me sick. Breaking rank like
a scared little bitch

20:22.053 --> 20:24.053
while the rest of us took the flak.

20:24.093 --> 20:27.212
You should've killed yourself after
that.  OK. That's a bit much.

20:27.252 --> 20:30.452
You're a disgrace to the uniform and
a traitor to Rome.

20:30.492 --> 20:33.052
While the arrows rained upon us.

20:33.093 --> 20:36.813
While our brothers lay dying
facedown in the dirt,

20:36.853 --> 20:40.932
you crawled off under your shield
like a fucking turtle!

20:40.972 --> 20:45.173
You deserted us, Hector. You left
us.

20:45.212 --> 20:49.732
And we will never, ever forgive you
for what you did!

20:49.772 --> 20:53.972
OK. I think he got the message. What
the fuck, Marcus?

20:54.012 --> 20:57.452
Well, he was a fraud. What were you
trying to do?

20:58.732 --> 21:01.813
Well...yeah. Basically this.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.932
She still won't mate with you?

21:06.972 --> 21:10.413
But you completely destroyed the
alpha male.  Sort of.

21:10.452 --> 21:14.813
I sub-contracted out his destruction
to another, much angrier alpha male.

21:14.853 --> 21:16.326
Ah. I guess it's not as sexy.

21:16.527 --> 21:19.373
Apparently I trigged some sort
of post-traumatic episode

21:19.413 --> 21:23.333
and now he won't get out of bed.
Should probably go and apologise.

21:23.373 --> 21:25.492
Where have you been, Grumie?

21:25.532 --> 21:28.252
I've not seen you at the stall for
days.

21:28.292 --> 21:30.772
Oh, you know me. Busy, busy.

21:30.813 --> 21:32.813
I made you another cake.

21:32.853 --> 21:36.532
It's a banana, fudge, cherry, berry,
custard cake.

21:37.653 --> 21:42.173
With frosted vanilla icing and
raisins on top.

21:49.012 --> 21:51.093
No. You're all right.

21:51.133 --> 21:53.173
You don't want it?  No, thanks.

21:53.212 --> 21:57.373
I'm not into your cakes anymore.
They're a bit...much.

21:57.413 --> 22:00.093
I'm on the cold turkey now.

22:00.133 --> 22:04.333
I see. So that's that, then?

22:04.373 --> 22:08.732
Yes. That is very much that.

22:11.012 --> 22:13.573
Well done, G-Man. I didn't think you
had it in you.

22:13.613 --> 22:16.772
That's the hardest thing I've done
in my whole life.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.732
So what's she gonna do with that?

22:20.012 --> 22:24.373
It's very sweet of you, Marcus.
Well, I just wanted to say sorry.

22:24.413 --> 22:27.373
And I figured he's a deserter, so he
must like dessert.

22:28.373 --> 22:31.413
Too soon? A bit but thanks for the
cake.

22:31.452 --> 22:34.972
Well, Agatha here made it. You're an
amazing baker, darling.

22:35.012 --> 22:38.853
I've been on bloody health foods for
eight years. This is unbelievable.

22:38.893 --> 22:40.893
Plenty more where that came from.
