WEBVTT

02:56.511 --> 02:58.846
This will begin to make things right.

02:59.764 --> 03:02.767
I've traveled too far and seen too much

03:02.850 --> 03:05.812
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

03:05.937 --> 03:09.774
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.152
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

03:13.278 --> 03:15.078
The General's been after this
for a long time.

03:15.488 --> 03:16.906
Oh, the General?

03:16.990 --> 03:19.367
To me, she is royalty.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.369
Well, she certainly is that.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.376
We got company.

03:41.431 --> 03:42.974
You have to hide.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.517
You have to leave.

03:46.644 --> 03:47.645
Go.

04:19.010 --> 04:21.346
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

04:33.608 --> 04:34.734
<i>Blast that X-wing!</i>

04:34.817 --> 04:35.985
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

04:41.032 --> 04:43.117
I see them.

05:14.732 --> 05:15.732
You take this.

05:15.775 --> 05:17.735
It's safer with you than it is with me.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.697
You get as far away from here
as you can.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.574
Do you hear me?

05:23.700 --> 05:25.076
I'll come back for you.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.120
It will be all right.

06:26.179 --> 06:27.472
<i>Keep moving!</i>

06:29.640 --> 06:30.975
<i>Stay here.</i>

06:54.373 --> 06:57.251
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

06:57.919 --> 07:00.880
Something far worse
has happened to you.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.674
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

07:04.050 --> 07:05.968
I know where you come from.

07:06.052 --> 07:08.012
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

07:08.513 --> 07:12.099
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

07:13.267 --> 07:16.020
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

07:16.145 --> 07:18.606
The First Order rose from the dark side.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.690
You did not.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.361
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

07:24.028 --> 07:25.696
You may try.

07:25.780 --> 07:29.784
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

07:30.535 --> 07:31.577
<i>You're so right.</i>

08:05.611 --> 08:07.905
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

08:09.073 --> 08:10.950
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

08:11.117 --> 08:12.702
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

08:12.785 --> 08:14.412
<i>- Search him.</i>
- ...apparatus.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.334
<i>- Nothing, sir.
- Put him on board.</i>

08:26.465 --> 08:28.968
<i>Sir, the villagers?</i>

08:31.554 --> 08:32.763
<i>Kill them all.</i>

08:34.265 --> 08:35.850
<i>On my command.</i>

08:36.808 --> 08:38.184
<i>Fire.</i>

08:38.269 --> 08:40.270
Please, no!

09:08.758 --> 09:10.551
<i>Nothing here.
Go ahead!</i>

09:51.592 --> 09:52.677
All right.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.761
All right!

10:19.662 --> 10:21.372
<i>FN-2187.</i>

10:22.039 --> 10:24.542
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

10:25.209 --> 10:26.460
Yes, Captain.

10:27.003 --> 10:29.714
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

10:30.381 --> 10:31.382
I'm sorry, Captain.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.551
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

13:19.258 --> 13:22.511
What you brought
me today is worth...

13:22.636 --> 13:24.305
hmm...

13:25.556 --> 13:28.350
one quarter portion.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.012
Shh.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.349
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.643
He has no respect for anyone.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.440
Your antenna's bent.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.242
Where do you come from?

15:54.038 --> 15:55.831
Classified, really?

15:55.914 --> 15:57.207
Me too. Big secret.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.211
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.218
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

16:03.339 --> 16:04.757
You'll drown in the sand.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.973
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.186
No!

16:33.577 --> 16:35.204
In the morning, you go.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.127
You're welcome.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.099
<i>I had no idea we had...</i>

16:55.182 --> 16:57.935
<i>the best pilot in
the Resistance on board.</i>

17:00.354 --> 17:01.355
<i>Comfortable?</i>

17:01.939 --> 17:02.940
Not really.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.692
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

17:08.194 --> 17:09.905
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

17:10.614 --> 17:13.492
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

17:13.992 --> 17:16.328
You might want to rethink
your technique.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.138
<i>Where is it?</i>

17:36.098 --> 17:37.724
The Resistance...

17:37.808 --> 17:39.810
will not be intimidated by you.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.775
<i>Where... is it?</i>

17:56.743 --> 17:59.496
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

17:59.580 --> 18:02.040
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.792
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

18:05.752 --> 18:08.630
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.841
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.384
Classified.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.137
I know all about waiting.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.182
For my family.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.602
They'll be back. One day.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.395
Come on.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.568
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

18:30.402 --> 18:32.529
Let me see here... hmm...

18:32.905 --> 18:35.616
one half portion.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.409
Last week they were a half portion each.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.203
What about the droid?

18:42.039 --> 18:43.081
What about him?

18:43.207 --> 18:45.375
I'll pay for him.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.550
Sixty portions.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.563
Actually...

19:08.565 --> 19:10.484
The droid's not for sale.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
Come on.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.494
Follow the girl and get that droid.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.791
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

19:35.175 --> 19:36.301
<i>Turn here.</i>

19:38.262 --> 19:39.263
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

19:39.346 --> 19:41.598
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

19:41.682 --> 19:42.683
What?

19:43.934 --> 19:46.019
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

19:46.103 --> 19:47.854
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

19:47.938 --> 19:49.018
You're with the Resistance?

19:49.106 --> 19:51.024
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

19:51.108 --> 19:53.110
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.446
Why? Why are you helping me?

19:57.823 --> 19:59.533
Because it's the right thing to do.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.493
You need a pilot.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.953
I need a pilot.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.539
We're gonna do this.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.873
Yeah?

20:11.169 --> 20:13.380
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

20:13.463 --> 20:15.966
- I am calm.
<i>- I'm talking to myself.</i>

20:18.468 --> 20:19.469
<i>Not yet.</i>

20:21.346 --> 20:23.056
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

20:29.313 --> 20:31.398
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.567
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.985
Okay, same principle.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.069
Use the toggle on the left...

20:36.153 --> 20:37.821
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.364
Use the sight on the right to aim.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.621
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.249
I can fix this.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.088
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.924
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

21:18.612 --> 21:19.732
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

21:21.782 --> 21:22.866
I got it.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.330
This thing really moves.

21:32.918 --> 21:35.087
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

21:35.253 --> 21:36.296
or we're not gonna get very far.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.798
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

21:37.881 --> 21:38.882
Just stay sharp.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.679
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

21:43.762 --> 21:44.805
I got us dead center.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.288
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

21:54.773 --> 21:56.191
- Yeah!
- Yes!

21:56.274 --> 21:57.359
Did you see that?

21:57.442 --> 21:59.069
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

22:04.741 --> 22:05.867
Hey, what's your name?

22:05.951 --> 22:07.202
FN-2187.

22:07.285 --> 22:08.495
F... What?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.414
That's the only name they ever gave me.

22:10.539 --> 22:12.999
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

22:13.083 --> 22:14.584
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.294
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.046
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.298
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.502
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.306
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.475
Use the ventral cannons.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.728
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

22:32.811 --> 22:35.522
<i>General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

22:35.605 --> 22:38.024
Yes, and he had help...

22:38.108 --> 22:39.484
from one of our own.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.486
We're checking the registers now...

22:41.611 --> 22:43.488
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.992
<i>The one from the village. FN-2187.</i>

22:47.617 --> 22:49.411
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

22:49.953 --> 22:50.954
Fire.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.007
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.842
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

23:03.967 --> 23:04.968
I see him!

23:08.346 --> 23:09.848
Nice shot!

23:16.188 --> 23:17.272
Where are we going?

23:17.397 --> 23:18.523
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.192
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.735
We need to get out of this system.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.738
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.071
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.365
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

23:27.491 --> 23:28.492
I don't care what color he is!

23:28.575 --> 23:29.826
No droid can be that important.

23:29.910 --> 23:30.911
This one is, pal!

23:30.994 --> 23:32.662
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

23:32.788 --> 23:34.080
We go back to Jakku, we die.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.875
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.877
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

23:41.963 --> 23:45.050
<i>FN-2187 reported
to my division...</i>

23:45.175 --> 23:47.469
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

23:47.552 --> 23:49.805
No prior signs of nonconformity?

23:49.888 --> 23:51.807
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

23:51.890 --> 23:53.016
General!

23:53.099 --> 23:54.476
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

23:54.559 --> 23:55.811
Disabled.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.312
They were headed back to Jakku.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.635
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.358
They were going back for the droid.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.401
Send a squad to the wreckage.

24:25.757 --> 24:26.925
Poe!

24:28.260 --> 24:29.553
Poe!

24:30.387 --> 24:31.429
Poe!

24:34.891 --> 24:36.393
Poe! I got you.

24:38.562 --> 24:39.563
Poe!

24:46.403 --> 24:47.445
Poe!

26:11.655 --> 26:13.865
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

26:14.032 --> 26:16.451
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

26:16.534 --> 26:18.328
<i>How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

26:18.453 --> 26:19.933
I won't have you question my methods.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.076
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

26:22.165 --> 26:24.960
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

26:25.085 --> 26:26.127
My men are exceptionally trained.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.420
Programmed from birth.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.798
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

26:29.881 --> 26:30.882
<i>Unharmed.</i>

26:31.967 --> 26:34.135
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

26:34.219 --> 26:36.680
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.265
<i>I want that map.</i>

26:39.349 --> 26:40.725
<i>For your sake...</i>

26:40.850 --> 26:42.060
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

26:48.650 --> 26:49.818
Water. Water.

26:49.901 --> 26:50.944
No water.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.529
Water.

26:54.406 --> 26:55.490
Is there water?

27:23.935 --> 27:26.271
What? Oi, get off him!

27:35.739 --> 27:36.740
Hey!

27:53.131 --> 27:55.175
They work for Unkar.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.052
That guy that wanted you.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.762
He must have really wanted you.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.016
Who?

28:03.933 --> 28:06.102
Him?

28:24.913 --> 28:28.083
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

28:28.249 --> 28:29.709
Ow!

28:29.793 --> 28:31.086
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.670
This droid says you stole it.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.310
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

28:35.423 --> 28:36.508
So I'd appreciate it...

28:36.633 --> 28:37.842
if you stop accusing me of...

28:37.967 --> 28:40.386
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

28:40.470 --> 28:41.805
It belongs to his master.

28:45.100 --> 28:48.186
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

28:50.230 --> 28:52.857
He was captured by the First Order.

28:52.982 --> 28:55.568
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

28:58.696 --> 28:59.823
Poe didn't make it.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.830
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.714
So you're with the Resistance?

29:21.344 --> 29:22.679
Obviously.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.139
Yes, I am.

29:24.222 --> 29:25.515
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.684
I am with the Resistance.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.312
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.315
Well, this is what we look like.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.943
Some of us. Others look different.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.486
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.071
He has to get back to your base.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.448
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

29:42.532 --> 29:44.200
and everyone's after it.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.536
Luke Skywalker?

29:47.078 --> 29:48.580
I thought he was a myth.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.874
What?

29:58.882 --> 30:00.425
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

30:01.718 --> 30:02.886
Come on, BB-8!

30:06.222 --> 30:07.822
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

30:07.849 --> 30:09.934
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

30:12.520 --> 30:14.314
BB-8, stay close!

30:14.397 --> 30:15.398
This way.

30:21.196 --> 30:22.405
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

30:23.239 --> 30:24.782
Come on!

30:26.242 --> 30:27.482
They're shooting at both of us.

30:27.577 --> 30:29.454
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

30:29.579 --> 30:30.997
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

30:31.080 --> 30:33.000
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

30:34.209 --> 30:35.710
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

30:35.793 --> 30:37.337
Are you okay?

30:42.884 --> 30:44.302
Stop taking my hand!

31:00.610 --> 31:01.611
Hey.

31:04.906 --> 31:05.949
Are you okay?

31:07.951 --> 31:08.952
Yeah.

31:09.619 --> 31:10.745
Follow me.

31:22.298 --> 31:23.549
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

31:23.633 --> 31:24.926
in that quadjumper!

31:25.009 --> 31:26.344
Hey, we need a pilot!

31:26.469 --> 31:28.012
We've got one.

31:28.137 --> 31:29.138
You?

31:29.806 --> 31:31.766
Uh, what about that ship?

31:31.849 --> 31:33.309
That one's garbage!

31:38.815 --> 31:40.275
The garbage will do.

31:56.165 --> 31:57.875
Gunner position is down there!

32:01.129 --> 32:02.755
You ever fly this thing?

32:02.880 --> 32:06.009
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.176
Great.

32:11.389 --> 32:12.598
Whoa.

32:13.224 --> 32:14.809
I can do this. I can do this.

32:15.226 --> 32:16.853
I can do this. I can do this.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.042
Hey!

32:43.379 --> 32:44.922
That's mine!

32:48.509 --> 32:50.094
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

32:50.219 --> 32:51.304
- What?
<i>- Stay low!</i>

32:51.387 --> 32:52.597
It confuses their tracking.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.891
BB-8, hold on!

32:55.058 --> 32:56.434
I'm going low!

33:15.078 --> 33:16.287
What are you doing back there?

33:16.412 --> 33:17.580
Are you ever gonna fire back?

33:17.747 --> 33:19.791
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

33:19.916 --> 33:21.584
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

33:21.751 --> 33:23.628
Try sitting in this thing.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.268
We need cover, quick!

33:39.435 --> 33:40.728
We're about to get some!

33:40.812 --> 33:42.021
I hope.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.215
Damn it!

34:20.184 --> 34:21.978
Come on, come on!

34:24.813 --> 34:27.065
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.760
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.458
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

34:48.337 --> 34:50.840
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

35:04.645 --> 35:05.771
Are we really doing this?

35:15.198 --> 35:16.532
Oh, no.

35:37.970 --> 35:38.971
Whoo!

35:53.361 --> 35:54.862
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

35:54.946 --> 35:55.947
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

35:56.030 --> 35:57.323
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

35:57.406 --> 35:59.158
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

35:59.242 --> 36:00.409
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

36:00.493 --> 36:01.827
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

36:01.911 --> 36:03.511
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.918
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

36:10.294 --> 36:11.921
He's gonna get you home.

36:13.047 --> 36:14.048
We both will.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.013
I don't know your name.

36:22.974 --> 36:24.517
Finn. What's yours?

36:25.810 --> 36:27.103
I'm Rey.

36:31.649 --> 36:32.984
Rey...

36:33.609 --> 36:35.903
Help me with this. Quick!

36:35.987 --> 36:37.363
Whoa, what's going on?

36:48.624 --> 36:49.792
Sir...

36:49.875 --> 36:52.503
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

36:54.964 --> 36:56.132
It escaped capture...

36:56.215 --> 36:58.801
aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

37:00.344 --> 37:02.430
<i>The droid...</i>

37:02.513 --> 37:04.140
<i>stole a freighter?</i>

37:04.265 --> 37:05.641
Not exactly, sir.

37:06.309 --> 37:07.310
It had help.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.023
We have no confirmation...

37:12.148 --> 37:14.525
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

37:32.877 --> 37:33.878
<i>Anything else?</i>

37:36.756 --> 37:38.174
The two were accompanied by a girl.

37:43.596 --> 37:45.348
<i>What girl?</i>

37:48.059 --> 37:49.143
It's the motivator.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.786
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

37:50.811 --> 37:51.812
How bad is it?

37:51.896 --> 37:53.564
If we wanna live, not good.

37:53.689 --> 37:54.649
They're hunting for us now.

37:54.732 --> 37:55.900
We've gotta get out of this system!

37:56.025 --> 37:57.526
BB-8 said the location
of the Resistance base...

37:57.693 --> 37:58.736
is "need to know".

37:58.861 --> 38:00.488
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

38:00.571 --> 38:01.572
This?

38:02.823 --> 38:04.450
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

38:04.575 --> 38:07.161
I don't speak that.

38:07.244 --> 38:08.996
All right, between us...

38:09.080 --> 38:10.539
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

38:11.540 --> 38:13.125
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

38:13.209 --> 38:14.960
But you tell us where the base is...

38:15.044 --> 38:16.462
I'll get you there first. Deal?

38:17.546 --> 38:20.049
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

38:20.174 --> 38:22.802
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.014
Please.

38:29.058 --> 38:30.935
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.940
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

38:33.062 --> 38:34.397
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

38:34.563 --> 38:35.648
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

38:35.731 --> 38:36.816
What about you?

38:36.899 --> 38:38.109
I gotta get back to Jakku.

38:38.234 --> 38:39.234
Back to Jak...

38:39.276 --> 38:40.736
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

38:40.820 --> 38:43.406
- It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

38:43.531 --> 38:45.408
The one I'm pointing to. No.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.784
No. No!

38:46.909 --> 38:48.244
If we don't patch it up...

38:48.411 --> 38:49.453
the propulsion tank will overflow...

38:49.537 --> 38:51.205
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

38:51.288 --> 38:52.289
- This?
- Yes.

38:53.666 --> 38:56.502
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.504
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

38:58.587 --> 38:59.880
You got a family?

38:59.964 --> 39:01.090
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

39:01.215 --> 39:02.675
None of your business, that's why.

39:05.094 --> 39:06.654
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

39:12.435 --> 39:13.475
Someone's locked on to us.

39:13.561 --> 39:15.104
All controls are overridden.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.612
Get off! Get off!

39:25.364 --> 39:26.365
See anything?

39:27.825 --> 39:28.826
Oh, no.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.085
It's the First Order.

39:38.169 --> 39:39.962
What do we do?
There must be something.

39:40.755 --> 39:42.423
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

39:42.506 --> 39:43.507
Can you unfix it?

39:49.305 --> 39:50.306
Come on, BB-8.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.933
I got him.

39:54.268 --> 39:56.020
I'm okay.

39:56.854 --> 39:58.397
BB-8, get off me!

40:01.275 --> 40:02.943
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

40:03.027 --> 40:05.571
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.121
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

40:26.217 --> 40:28.636
Chewie...

40:28.719 --> 40:29.970
we're home.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.154
Where are the others?

40:47.238 --> 40:48.823
- Where's the pilot?
<i>- I'm the pilot.</i>

40:48.906 --> 40:50.366
You?

40:50.449 --> 40:52.409
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

40:52.493 --> 40:53.911
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

40:54.036 --> 40:55.162
And "that thing"
can understand you, too...

40:55.246 --> 40:56.288
so watch it.

40:56.372 --> 40:58.290
Come on out of there.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.876
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.546
Jakku? That junkyard?

41:03.629 --> 41:04.839
Thank you! Junkyard.

41:04.922 --> 41:07.007
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

41:07.091 --> 41:08.843
Who had it? Ducain?

41:08.926 --> 41:10.761
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

41:10.845 --> 41:13.055
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.474
Who stole it from me!

41:15.558 --> 41:16.976
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

41:17.059 --> 41:19.436
just stole back the
<i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

41:19.562 --> 41:22.439
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
You're Han Solo?

41:24.066 --> 41:25.609
I used to be.

41:26.277 --> 41:27.736
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

41:27.820 --> 41:29.196
No, the smuggler.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.115
Wasn't he a war hero?

41:31.198 --> 41:34.535
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

41:34.618 --> 41:35.870
Twelve!

41:36.954 --> 41:38.414
Fourteen.

41:53.762 --> 41:54.930
Hey!

41:55.431 --> 41:58.434
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

41:58.517 --> 41:59.602
Unkar Plutt did.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.061
I thought it was a mistake,
too. Puts too much...

42:01.145 --> 42:03.439
...stress on the hyperdrive.

42:04.481 --> 42:05.941
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

42:06.066 --> 42:07.946
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

42:08.027 --> 42:09.737
Wait, no.

42:09.820 --> 42:12.239
- We need your help.
- My help?

42:12.323 --> 42:13.866
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

42:13.949 --> 42:15.242
as soon as possible.

42:15.951 --> 42:18.329
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

42:22.833 --> 42:25.753
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

42:31.842 --> 42:32.843
You knew him.

42:36.180 --> 42:39.308
Yeah. I knew him.

42:39.391 --> 42:41.018
I knew Luke.

42:43.812 --> 42:46.106
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

42:46.774 --> 42:47.775
Wait, what?

42:48.692 --> 42:50.361
Did you just say Rathtars?

42:51.111 --> 42:52.112
Hey!

42:52.196 --> 42:54.740
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

42:55.282 --> 42:57.493
I'm hauling Rathtars.

42:57.576 --> 43:00.788
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

43:00.871 --> 43:02.331
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

43:02.456 --> 43:04.249
What's a Rathtar?

43:04.333 --> 43:05.834
They're big and they're dangerous.

43:05.918 --> 43:07.478
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

43:07.544 --> 43:08.587
- No.
- Good.

43:08.671 --> 43:10.547
I got three of them going to King Prana.

43:10.631 --> 43:12.967
Three? How'd you get them on board?

43:13.050 --> 43:14.760
I used to have a bigger crew.

43:18.347 --> 43:20.265
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

43:20.349 --> 43:21.934
and don't even think about
taking the <i>Falcon.</i>

43:22.017 --> 43:23.018
What about BB-8?

43:23.102 --> 43:24.812
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

43:24.895 --> 43:26.438
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

43:26.522 --> 43:28.562
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

43:30.901 --> 43:32.945
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

43:33.028 --> 43:35.322
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

43:36.657 --> 43:38.909
Yes, I do. Every time.

43:56.176 --> 43:58.178
Han Solo.

43:58.262 --> 43:59.722
You're a dead man.

43:59.847 --> 44:02.558
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

44:02.766 --> 44:05.436
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

44:05.602 --> 44:08.063
- Can you see them?
- No.

44:08.230 --> 44:11.233
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

44:11.442 --> 44:13.569
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

44:14.236 --> 44:16.655
How long we known each other?

44:16.739 --> 44:17.823
They have blasters.

44:17.906 --> 44:18.991
A lot of them.

44:19.074 --> 44:22.286
Not long.
We want our money back now.

44:22.369 --> 44:24.371
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

44:24.455 --> 44:25.622
I spent that money.

44:25.706 --> 44:28.125
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.544
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

44:30.627 --> 44:32.504
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

44:41.805 --> 44:44.016
Tasu Leech.

44:44.099 --> 44:45.100
Good to see you.

44:53.942 --> 44:56.945
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

44:57.029 --> 44:58.405
Have I ever not delivered...

44:58.489 --> 44:59.990
- for you before?
- Yeah.

45:04.286 --> 45:07.289
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

45:07.414 --> 45:09.917
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

45:12.586 --> 45:13.587
That BB unit.

45:13.670 --> 45:16.507
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

45:20.010 --> 45:21.303
And two fugitives.

45:25.182 --> 45:26.308
First I've heard of it.

45:32.147 --> 45:33.315
Wait, wait, wait.

45:36.485 --> 45:38.529
If we close the blast doors
in that corridor...

45:38.654 --> 45:39.780
we can trap both gangs!

45:39.863 --> 45:41.323
We'll close the blast doors from here?

45:41.406 --> 45:43.200
Resetting the fuses should do it.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.960
I got a bad feeling about this.

45:53.043 --> 45:55.170
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

45:56.130 --> 45:57.131
Wrong fuses.

45:57.214 --> 45:58.382
Kill them!

45:58.507 --> 45:59.716
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

46:25.534 --> 46:27.369
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

46:40.591 --> 46:41.592
What do they look like?

46:47.556 --> 46:49.558
They look like that.

46:51.810 --> 46:53.645
- This way.
- Are you sure?

46:55.564 --> 46:56.732
No, no, no!

46:57.774 --> 46:59.151
Finn!

47:00.152 --> 47:01.236
Finn!

47:02.404 --> 47:03.405
Rey!

47:06.575 --> 47:07.868
Get off! Get off!

47:13.290 --> 47:15.626
- Rey!
- Finn!

47:16.835 --> 47:17.920
Finn!

47:18.587 --> 47:20.255
<i>Get off me!</i>

47:31.934 --> 47:33.435
<i>Rey!</i>

47:36.480 --> 47:39.358
Get off! Get off!

47:41.777 --> 47:43.278
Finn!

47:43.946 --> 47:46.281
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

47:50.327 --> 47:52.621
I got the door. Cover us!

47:59.461 --> 48:01.338
Chewie!

48:04.216 --> 48:05.801
You okay?

48:06.969 --> 48:07.970
Wow.

48:10.180 --> 48:12.391
Come on! Come on!

48:16.144 --> 48:17.145
Han.

48:17.229 --> 48:19.481
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

48:27.155 --> 48:28.407
Hey, where are you going?

48:28.490 --> 48:30.158
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

48:30.242 --> 48:32.035
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.328
I hate that guy.

48:33.453 --> 48:35.956
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

48:38.417 --> 48:40.377
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

48:40.502 --> 48:42.302
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

48:42.379 --> 48:44.631
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

48:46.883 --> 48:49.011
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

48:49.136 --> 48:51.096
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

48:51.179 --> 48:52.347
No problem!

49:02.274 --> 49:03.594
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

49:06.069 --> 49:08.030
- What?
- Compressor.

49:16.538 --> 49:17.748
Inform the First Order...

49:17.831 --> 49:19.666
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

49:19.750 --> 49:21.752
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

49:30.677 --> 49:35.057
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

49:36.266 --> 49:40.062
leading them to the last Jedi.

49:41.271 --> 49:45.025
If Skywalker returns...

49:45.567 --> 49:49.571
the new Jedi will rise.

49:50.739 --> 49:52.282
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

49:52.407 --> 49:54.076
General!

49:56.286 --> 49:59.081
Our strategy must now change.

49:59.206 --> 50:01.249
The weapon. It is ready.

50:01.375 --> 50:03.627
I believe the time has come to use it.

50:03.752 --> 50:05.045
We shall destroy the government...

50:05.128 --> 50:06.546
that supports the Resistance...

50:06.630 --> 50:08.340
the Republic.

50:08.423 --> 50:10.023
Without their friends to protect them...

50:10.050 --> 50:11.635
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

50:11.885 --> 50:14.805
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

50:14.888 --> 50:16.139
Go.

50:16.932 --> 50:18.350
Oversee preparations.

50:18.433 --> 50:20.102
Yes, Supreme Leader.

50:26.066 --> 50:27.442
There has been an awakening.

50:29.152 --> 50:30.904
Have you felt it?

50:32.447 --> 50:33.490
<i>Yes.</i>

50:34.866 --> 50:36.493
There's something more.

50:38.036 --> 50:42.207
The droid we seek is aboard
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

50:42.999 --> 50:45.877
In the hands of your father...

50:45.961 --> 50:49.798
Han Solo.

50:52.426 --> 50:54.803
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

50:54.928 --> 50:59.724
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

51:00.350 --> 51:03.812
have never faced such a test.

51:04.438 --> 51:07.649
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

51:08.775 --> 51:10.610
We shall see.

51:13.196 --> 51:15.031
We shall see.

51:23.123 --> 51:25.333
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

51:25.459 --> 51:26.710
Coolant's leaking.

51:28.044 --> 51:29.296
Try transferring auxiliary power...

51:29.421 --> 51:30.797
...to the secondary tank.

51:30.881 --> 51:32.424
I got it.

51:32.591 --> 51:34.217
Chewie, come on!

51:35.844 --> 51:37.444
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

51:37.512 --> 51:38.513
Stop moving!

51:40.557 --> 51:42.350
Chewie!

51:42.476 --> 51:44.186
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

51:44.311 --> 51:46.646
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

51:47.564 --> 51:49.024
Which is fine!

51:49.149 --> 51:50.609
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

51:50.692 --> 51:52.652
pieces of us in three different systems.

51:56.031 --> 51:57.032
What'd you do?

51:58.074 --> 51:59.993
I bypassed the compressor.

52:02.329 --> 52:03.330
Huh.

52:06.583 --> 52:07.876
Move, ball.

52:10.045 --> 52:12.130
Ah, don't say that.

52:12.214 --> 52:13.882
You did great. Just rest.

52:14.799 --> 52:15.884
Good job, kid.

52:16.343 --> 52:17.344
Thanks.

52:17.886 --> 52:19.179
You're welcome.

52:23.934 --> 52:25.352
So...

52:25.477 --> 52:26.811
fugitives, huh?

52:28.730 --> 52:30.023
The First Order wants the map.

52:30.106 --> 52:31.399
Finn is with the Resistance.

52:32.025 --> 52:33.443
I'm just a scavenger.

52:35.487 --> 52:36.488
Let's see what you got.

52:37.364 --> 52:39.449
Go ahead.

52:48.583 --> 52:50.752
This map's not complete.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.337
It's just a piece.

52:53.547 --> 52:55.340
Ever since Luke disappeared...

52:55.465 --> 52:57.467
people have been looking for him.

52:57.551 --> 52:59.052
Why did he leave?

53:00.262 --> 53:03.014
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

53:03.098 --> 53:04.766
One boy, an apprentice...

53:04.849 --> 53:07.143
turned against him, destroyed it all.

53:08.728 --> 53:10.647
Luke felt responsible.

53:10.730 --> 53:13.233
He just walked away from everything.

53:13.942 --> 53:15.402
Do you know what happened to him?

53:15.569 --> 53:17.946
A lot of rumors. Stories.

53:19.948 --> 53:22.158
People that knew him best...

53:23.660 --> 53:26.037
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

53:27.789 --> 53:29.124
The Jedi were real?

53:29.207 --> 53:31.418
I used to wonder about that myself.

53:31.501 --> 53:33.712
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

53:34.588 --> 53:37.173
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

53:37.257 --> 53:39.384
the dark side and the light.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.929
Crazy thing is...

53:45.724 --> 53:46.766
it's true.

53:49.311 --> 53:50.937
The Force. The Jedi.

53:53.523 --> 53:54.524
All of it.

53:57.777 --> 53:59.112
It's all true.

54:02.365 --> 54:04.492
No, you rest.

54:04.618 --> 54:07.370
You want my help? You're getting it.

54:07.454 --> 54:09.497
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

54:10.790 --> 54:12.125
This is our stop.

54:29.517 --> 54:31.019
I didn't know there was
this much green...

54:31.102 --> 54:32.395
in the whole galaxy.

55:00.382 --> 55:02.425
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

55:02.550 --> 55:04.177
Did you just call me Solo?

55:04.260 --> 55:05.887
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

55:05.970 --> 55:07.055
You should know...

55:07.138 --> 55:09.516
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

55:09.599 --> 55:11.935
Which puts a real target on my back.

55:12.060 --> 55:13.645
Are there any conspirators here?

55:13.728 --> 55:15.605
Like, First Order sympathizers?

55:15.730 --> 55:18.400
Listen, Big Deal.

55:18.483 --> 55:20.402
You got another problem.

55:20.485 --> 55:22.654
Women always figure out the truth.

55:24.239 --> 55:25.573
Always.

55:31.579 --> 55:32.956
You might need this.

55:34.249 --> 55:35.917
I think I can handle myself.

55:36.042 --> 55:38.169
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

55:38.253 --> 55:39.254
Take it.

55:42.090 --> 55:43.258
You know how to use one of those?

55:43.341 --> 55:45.009
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

55:45.093 --> 55:46.928
Little bit more to it than that.

55:47.429 --> 55:49.097
You got a lot to learn.

55:50.515 --> 55:51.766
You got a name?

55:52.684 --> 55:53.685
Rey.

55:54.394 --> 55:55.395
Rey.

55:59.274 --> 56:01.693
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

56:01.776 --> 56:03.737
A second mate. Someone to help out.

56:03.820 --> 56:05.447
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

56:05.530 --> 56:07.115
appreciates the <i>Falcon.</i>

56:07.240 --> 56:09.033
Are you offering me a job?

56:09.117 --> 56:11.619
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

56:11.745 --> 56:13.580
You're offering me a job.

56:14.789 --> 56:16.291
I'm thinking about it.

56:19.961 --> 56:21.129
Well?

56:25.633 --> 56:28.303
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

56:29.220 --> 56:30.722
Where, Jakku?

56:31.306 --> 56:33.099
I've already been away too long.

56:34.809 --> 56:37.187
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

56:40.899 --> 56:43.818
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

56:46.905 --> 56:48.573
Solo, why are we here again?

56:48.698 --> 56:50.200
To get your droid on a clean ship.

56:50.325 --> 56:51.325
Clean?

56:51.367 --> 56:54.245
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon?</i>

56:54.913 --> 56:56.456
If we can find it on our scanners...

56:56.539 --> 56:58.875
the First Order's not far behind.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.795
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

57:01.878 --> 57:03.713
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

57:04.589 --> 57:06.090
We can trust her, right?

57:06.174 --> 57:07.717
Relax, kid.

57:07.842 --> 57:10.512
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

57:11.262 --> 57:13.306
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

57:13.389 --> 57:14.766
so let me do the talking.

57:14.849 --> 57:16.601
And whatever you do, don't stare.

57:16.684 --> 57:17.727
At what?

57:18.770 --> 57:19.854
Any of it.

57:41.042 --> 57:43.044
Han Solo!

57:47.215 --> 57:48.466
Oh, boy.

57:48.591 --> 57:49.759
Hey, Maz.

57:53.596 --> 57:55.557
Where's my boyfriend?

57:56.057 --> 57:57.684
Chewie's working on the <i>Falcon.</i>

57:57.767 --> 57:58.768
I like that Wookiee.

57:59.561 --> 58:01.521
I assume you need something.

58:01.604 --> 58:03.022
Desperately.

58:03.106 --> 58:04.107
Let's get to it.

58:58.661 --> 59:00.121
<i>Forgive me.</i>

59:02.790 --> 59:04.459
<i>I feel it again.</i>

59:08.129 --> 59:09.672
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

59:12.508 --> 59:15.011
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

59:16.095 --> 59:17.472
<i>Show me again.</i>

59:17.972 --> 59:20.141
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

59:21.434 --> 59:24.020
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

59:24.979 --> 59:26.356
<i>Show me...</i>

59:28.524 --> 59:29.859
<i>Grandfather...</i>

59:32.320 --> 59:34.656
<i>and I will finish...</i>

59:34.781 --> 59:36.157
<i>what you started.</i>

59:48.962 --> 59:50.380
A map.

59:51.005 --> 59:53.132
To Skywalker himself?

59:53.216 --> 59:55.969
You are right back
in the mess.

59:56.052 --> 59:59.514
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

01:00:00.348 --> 01:00:01.349
Hmm...

01:00:01.474 --> 01:00:02.475
No.

01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:07.855
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

01:00:08.356 --> 01:00:09.356
Han.

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.528
Go home.

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:15.488
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

01:00:15.571 --> 01:00:17.782
Please, we came here for your help.

01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:20.034
What fight?

01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:23.287
The only fight.

01:00:23.371 --> 01:00:25.540
Against the dark side.

01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:26.958
Through the ages...

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:29.168
I've seen evil take many forms.

01:00:30.253 --> 01:00:32.463
The Sith. The Empire.

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:35.883
Today, it is the First Order.

01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:39.595
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:41.097
We must face them.

01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:43.266
Fight them.

01:00:43.391 --> 01:00:44.934
All of us.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.145
There is no fight against the First Order.

01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:48.354
Not one we can win.

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:50.815
Look around.

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:53.276
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:55.611
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:57.905
What's this?

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:00.742
What are you doing?

01:01:05.455 --> 01:01:06.956
Solo, what is she doing?

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:08.833
I don't know. But it ain't good.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.793
If you live long enough...

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:14.380
you see the same eyes
in different people.

01:01:15.298 --> 01:01:19.761
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:24.599
You don't know a thing about me.

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.936
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

01:01:29.604 --> 01:01:32.273
You don't know the First Order like I do.

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:35.401
They'll slaughter us.

01:01:35.485 --> 01:01:37.612
We all need to run.

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:39.781
Hmm.

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:47.080
You see those two?

01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:49.415
They'll trade work for transportation...

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.958
to the Outer Rim.

01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:53.252
There, you can disappear.

01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.462
Finn?

01:01:56.881 --> 01:01:57.882
Come with me.

01:01:58.925 --> 01:02:00.968
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:02.720
We have to get him back to your base.

01:02:07.809 --> 01:02:09.143
I can't.

01:02:17.944 --> 01:02:19.153
Keep it, kid.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:30.832
Who's the girl?

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:37.755
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:38.923
What are you doing?

01:02:40.675 --> 01:02:41.676
Don't leave without me.

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:47.348
You can't just go. I won't let you.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.516
I'm not who you think I am.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.684
Finn, what are you talking about?

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:50.810
I'm not Resistance.

01:02:51.519 --> 01:02:53.020
I'm not a hero.

01:02:56.274 --> 01:02:58.025
I'm a stormtrooper.

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:02.113
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

01:03:02.864 --> 01:03:04.866
And raised to do one thing.

01:03:05.575 --> 01:03:08.703
But my first battle, I made a choice.

01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:11.706
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:15.293
So I ran. Right into you.

01:03:16.878 --> 01:03:18.963
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

01:03:21.883 --> 01:03:24.177
I was ashamed of what I was.

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:28.723
But I'm done with the First Order.

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:30.641
I'm never going back.

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:34.478
Rey, come with me.

01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:36.814
Don't go.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:43.738
Take care of yourself.

01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:47.200
Please.

01:04:00.922 --> 01:04:03.007
<i>No!</i>

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.259
<i>No!</i>

01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:21.442
<i>No! Come back!</i>

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:24.237
<i>No!</i>

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:42.129
<i>Come back!</i>

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:54.308
<i>No!</i>

01:05:45.276 --> 01:05:47.111
<i>No!</i>

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:48.738
<i>Its energy...</i>

01:05:52.533 --> 01:05:54.577
<i>- ...surrounds us...
- No!</i>

01:05:54.702 --> 01:05:57.038
<i>...and binds us...</i>

01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:06.005
<i>The Force will be...</i>

01:06:15.056 --> 01:06:16.557
<i>No!</i>

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:18.559
Come back!

01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:20.186
<i>Quiet, girl.</i>

01:06:21.062 --> 01:06:22.063
No!

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.651
<i>Rey?</i>

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:34.950
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:40.915
What was that?

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.877
I shouldn't have gone in there.

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:49.590
That lightsaber was Luke's.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.467
And his father's before him.

01:06:51.592 --> 01:06:55.221
And now, it calls to you.

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:56.764
I have to get back to Jakku.

01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.100
Han told me.

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.901
Dear child.

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:11.028
I see your eyes.

01:07:11.112 --> 01:07:14.115
You already know the truth.

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:16.659
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:19.954
they're never coming back.

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.128
But...

01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:29.630
there's someone who still could.

01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:33.926
Luke.

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:37.680
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:39.473
it is ahead.

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:43.144
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:47.356
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

01:07:49.275 --> 01:07:50.860
Close your eyes.

01:07:53.154 --> 01:07:54.155
Feel it.

01:07:55.448 --> 01:07:57.533
The light...

01:07:57.658 --> 01:08:00.035
it's always been there.

01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:02.163
It will guide you.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.333
The saber. Take it.

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:12.298
I'm never touching that thing again.

01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:13.883
I don't want any part of this.

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.345
Hmm.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:43.871
<i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:51.377
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:56.759
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

01:08:56.884 --> 01:09:01.721
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:05.434
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

01:09:06.227 --> 01:09:09.563
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

01:09:09.647 --> 01:09:13.149
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:15.069
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.571
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.491
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:25.037
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.622
<i>And will remember this...</i>

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:32.795
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.715
Confirm transfer to manual control.

01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:38.341
Configure!

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.926
<i>Fire!</i>

01:10:39.987 --> 01:10:42.656
No. What is it?

01:10:58.672 --> 01:10:59.840
It was the Republic.

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:02.635
The First Order, they've done it.

01:11:05.012 --> 01:11:06.180
Where's Rey?

01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:25.699
What are you doing?

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.911
You have to go back.

01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:30.120
I'm leaving.

01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:32.373
BB-8...

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:33.540
No, you can't.

01:11:33.624 --> 01:11:35.793
You have to go back,
you're too important.

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:37.044
They'll help you.

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:53.018
I've had this for ages.

01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:58.399
Kept it locked away.

01:11:58.857 --> 01:11:59.858
Where'd you get that?

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:04.238
A good question. For another time.

01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:06.323
Take it.

01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:07.908
Find your friend!

01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:17.084
Those beasts.

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:18.210
They're here.

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:44.778
<i>FN-417, hold position.</i>

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.282
Oh, safety.

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:15.058
<i>Sir.</i>

01:13:15.142 --> 01:13:16.477
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.561
<i>With a girl.</i>

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:25.569
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:28.489
I'll try to fight them off.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:29.823
I hope so, too.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.171
Come on, Chewie!

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:48.592
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:49.676
Now! Go!

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.095
I need a weapon!

01:13:52.179 --> 01:13:53.639
You have one!

01:14:03.023 --> 01:14:05.692
Hey, can I try that?

01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:13.659
I like this thing.

01:14:19.623 --> 01:14:20.916
<i>Traitor!</i>

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:07.504
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:08.589
<i>Don't move.</i>

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.592
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:20.017
<i>We have incoming at 28. 6.</i>

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.102
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:26.106
<i>Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads!</i>

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.029
<i>Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!</i>

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:32.279
It's the Resistance.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.372
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

01:15:42.456 --> 01:15:44.082
<i>- Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe.</i>

01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:13.820
Quick!

01:16:41.807 --> 01:16:44.101
Whoo! Yeah!

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:46.603
That's one hell of a pilot!

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.021
Whoo-hoo!

01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:44.411
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.258
<i>The droid.</i>

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:02.220
<i>Where is it?</i>

01:18:07.434 --> 01:18:09.061
<i>Request air support.</i>

01:18:16.193 --> 01:18:17.569
<i>The map.</i>

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:21.698
<i>You've seen it.</i>

01:18:21.782 --> 01:18:24.117
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

01:18:25.077 --> 01:18:26.661
<i>We need more troops.</i>

01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:28.622
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:31.792
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:39.925
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

01:18:55.315 --> 01:18:56.858
No!

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.988
No, no!

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:05.992
No! No!

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:08.995
Rey!

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:30.016
He took her. Did you see that?

01:19:30.851 --> 01:19:32.269
He took her. She's gone.

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:33.520
Yeah, I know.

01:19:42.863 --> 01:19:44.197
Let's go.

01:19:57.878 --> 01:20:00.380
Goodness! Han Solo!

01:20:00.505 --> 01:20:02.674
It is I, C-3PO.

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:04.718
You probably don't recognize me...

01:20:04.885 --> 01:20:06.344
because of the red arm.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:08.388
Look who it is, did you see who...

01:20:10.182 --> 01:20:11.183
Uh...

01:20:11.725 --> 01:20:12.726
Hmm.

01:20:12.851 --> 01:20:15.896
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

01:20:15.979 --> 01:20:18.315
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:21.067
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:24.738
You changed your hair.

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:28.491
Same jacket.

01:20:29.743 --> 01:20:31.536
No, new jacket.

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:45.508
I saw him.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:49.596
Leia, I saw our son.

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:52.557
He was here.

01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:34.349
Hey!

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.814
BB-8, my buddy.

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:42.899
Oh, it's so good to see you.

01:21:42.983 --> 01:21:43.984
Finn saved you?

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:45.151
Where is he?

01:21:45.277 --> 01:21:46.486
Poe?

01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:49.030
Oh, no.

01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:51.074
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:53.326
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:54.744
I got thrown from the crash.

01:21:54.828 --> 01:21:56.746
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:58.206
BB-8 says that you saved him.

01:21:58.331 --> 01:21:59.833
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:01.459
You completed my mission, Finn...

01:22:01.543 --> 01:22:02.544
That's my jacket.

01:22:02.711 --> 01:22:05.088
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:06.923
Keep it. It suits you.

01:22:07.799 --> 01:22:09.551
You're a good man, Finn.

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:12.429
Poe, I need your help.

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:16.808
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:20.895
General Organa...

01:22:22.731 --> 01:22:24.858
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:27.819
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:29.696
That was incredibly brave what you did.

01:22:29.779 --> 01:22:32.365
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:34.367
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

01:22:34.492 --> 01:22:36.369
Han told me about the girl.

01:22:36.453 --> 01:22:37.579
I'm sorry.

01:22:37.704 --> 01:22:39.748
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:40.832
He worked on the base.

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:43.251
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:44.627
That's where my friend was taken.

01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:46.004
I've got to get there fast.

01:22:46.129 --> 01:22:47.589
And I will do everything I can to help...

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:49.883
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

01:22:52.886 --> 01:22:54.596
That sounds very scary.

01:22:56.723 --> 01:22:58.850
You must be so brave.

01:23:01.686 --> 01:23:02.687
General...

01:23:02.812 --> 01:23:04.189
I regret to inform you...

01:23:04.272 --> 01:23:05.899
but this map recovered from BB-8...

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:07.484
is only partially complete.

01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:11.321
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:13.531
We simply do not have
enough information...

01:23:13.615 --> 01:23:15.116
to locate Master Luke.

01:23:16.201 --> 01:23:18.203
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

01:23:18.286 --> 01:23:19.287
and bring him home.

01:23:19.412 --> 01:23:20.538
Leia.

01:23:20.622 --> 01:23:21.706
Don't do that.

01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:22.999
Do what?

01:23:23.083 --> 01:23:24.209
Anything.

01:23:25.627 --> 01:23:27.504
Princesses.

01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:29.172
I'm trying to be helpful.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.424
When did that ever help?

01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:33.218
And don't say the Death Star.

01:23:48.441 --> 01:23:49.442
BB-8.

01:23:49.567 --> 01:23:52.612
You're wasting your time.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.447
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

01:23:54.614 --> 01:23:55.782
the rest of the map in his backup data.

01:23:55.949 --> 01:23:58.076
I am afraid not.

01:23:58.159 --> 01:24:02.205
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

01:24:04.791 --> 01:24:08.044
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:11.381
Listen to me, will you?

01:24:12.382 --> 01:24:14.717
I know every time you...

01:24:16.928 --> 01:24:19.305
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:21.391
You think I want to forget him?

01:24:21.474 --> 01:24:23.143
I want him back.

01:24:23.268 --> 01:24:25.353
There's nothing more we could
have done.

01:24:27.105 --> 01:24:28.481
There's too much Vader in him.

01:24:28.565 --> 01:24:31.484
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

01:24:31.568 --> 01:24:33.278
I just never should have sent him away.

01:24:33.361 --> 01:24:34.946
That's when I lost him.

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:38.199
That's when I lost you both.

01:24:40.285 --> 01:24:42.954
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

01:24:43.955 --> 01:24:46.916
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.710
We both did.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.672
We lost our son.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:53.923
Forever.

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:55.008
No.

01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:56.676
It was Snoke.

01:24:57.135 --> 01:24:59.762
He seduced our son to the dark side.

01:24:59.846 --> 01:25:01.431
But we can still save him.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.266
Me.

01:25:04.184 --> 01:25:05.226
You.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.396
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.898
Luke is a Jedi.

01:25:11.483 --> 01:25:12.817
You're his father.

01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:19.324
There is still light in him, I know it.

01:25:19.407 --> 01:25:21.117
General...

01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:23.703
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

01:25:50.522 --> 01:25:51.523
Where am I?

01:25:53.858 --> 01:25:55.193
<i>You're my guest.</i>

01:25:55.276 --> 01:25:56.611
Where are the others?

01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:58.363
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

01:25:58.446 --> 01:26:01.324
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

01:26:02.283 --> 01:26:04.744
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

01:26:06.746 --> 01:26:08.831
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

01:26:09.624 --> 01:26:11.292
That happens
when you're being hunted...

01:26:11.376 --> 01:26:13.294
by a creature in a mask.

01:26:38.236 --> 01:26:40.071
Tell me about the droid.

01:26:40.905 --> 01:26:42.740
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

01:26:42.824 --> 01:26:44.158
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:46.369
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

01:26:46.452 --> 01:26:47.829
And we have the rest.

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:49.706
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

01:26:49.789 --> 01:26:50.873
but we need the last piece.

01:26:50.957 --> 01:26:53.418
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

01:26:55.044 --> 01:26:56.045
You.

01:26:57.505 --> 01:26:58.756
A scavenger.

01:27:01.092 --> 01:27:03.219
You know I can take whatever I want.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.269
You're so lonely.

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:14.772
So afraid to leave.

01:27:18.943 --> 01:27:21.863
At night, desperate to sleep.

01:27:24.991 --> 01:27:26.576
You imagine an ocean.

01:27:27.535 --> 01:27:28.828
I see it.

01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:31.831
I see the island.

01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:37.712
And Han Solo.

01:27:40.048 --> 01:27:42.216
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

01:27:42.842 --> 01:27:44.344
He would have disappointed you.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:45.762
Get out of my head.

01:27:46.888 --> 01:27:48.431
I know you've seen the map.

01:27:50.016 --> 01:27:51.184
It's in there.

01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:53.353
And now you'll give it to me.

01:28:01.986 --> 01:28:04.030
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

01:28:06.491 --> 01:28:08.993
I'm not giving you anything.

01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:10.703
We'll see.

01:28:50.702 --> 01:28:51.703
You.

01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:53.788
You're afraid.

01:28:56.833 --> 01:28:59.752
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:10.763
<i>The scavenger...</i>

01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:12.515
resisted you?

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:14.183
She is strong with the Force.

01:29:14.267 --> 01:29:16.060
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

01:29:16.144 --> 01:29:17.353
And the droid?

01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:20.773
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:23.484
That the girl was all we needed.

01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:26.070
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

01:29:26.154 --> 01:29:27.280
to the hands of the enemy.

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:29.115
They may have the map already.

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:30.825
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:32.952
before they get to Skywalker.

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:34.912
We have their location.

01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:37.623
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

01:29:38.624 --> 01:29:39.917
Good.

01:29:40.001 --> 01:29:42.879
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:44.714
Prepare the weapon.

01:29:45.339 --> 01:29:48.134
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

01:29:48.217 --> 01:29:50.011
I just need your guidance.

01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:55.725
If what you say about this girl is true...

01:29:56.350 --> 01:30:01.022
Bring her to me.

01:30:14.994 --> 01:30:17.163
You will remove these restraints...

01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:20.333
and leave this cell with the door open.

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:25.838
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:30:28.758 --> 01:30:30.259
You will remove these restraints...

01:30:30.343 --> 01:30:33.012
and leave this cell with the door open.

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:41.395
<i>I'll tighten those restraints...</i>

01:30:41.521 --> 01:30:43.564
<i>scavenger scum.</i>

01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:59.455
You will remove these restraints...

01:30:59.539 --> 01:31:01.916
and leave this cell with the door open.

01:31:05.628 --> 01:31:07.213
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

01:31:07.296 --> 01:31:09.048
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

01:31:17.974 --> 01:31:21.018
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

01:31:33.739 --> 01:31:34.824
<i>No.</i>

01:31:35.825 --> 01:31:36.826
<i>No.</i>

01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:39.871
<i>Guards!</i>

01:31:42.415 --> 01:31:43.416
<i>Guards!</i>

01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.673
Begin charging the weapon.

01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:52.091
Yes, sir.

01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:53.467
Weapon charging.

01:32:12.737 --> 01:32:14.739
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

01:32:14.822 --> 01:32:16.157
confirms Finn's report.

01:32:16.282 --> 01:32:18.242
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

01:32:18.326 --> 01:32:19.619
built within the planet itself.

01:32:19.785 --> 01:32:20.785
A laser cannon?

01:32:20.828 --> 01:32:22.663
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:23.789
It's another Death Star.

01:32:23.873 --> 01:32:25.625
I wish that were the case, Major.

01:32:25.708 --> 01:32:26.959
This was the Death Star.

01:32:29.712 --> 01:32:32.214
And this is Starkiller Base.

01:32:32.715 --> 01:32:33.883
So, it's big.

01:32:33.966 --> 01:32:37.053
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

01:32:37.178 --> 01:32:39.305
It uses the power of the sun.

01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:41.682
As the weapon is charged...

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:43.893
the sun is drained until it disappears.

01:32:43.976 --> 01:32:44.977
Ma'am.

01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:48.022
The First Order...

01:32:48.147 --> 01:32:49.667
they're charging the weapon again now.

01:32:50.524 --> 01:32:52.401
Our system is the next target.

01:32:52.526 --> 01:32:53.527
Oh, my.

01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:55.112
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

01:32:55.196 --> 01:32:56.989
Okay. How do we blow it up?

01:32:57.073 --> 01:32:59.408
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

01:32:59.492 --> 01:33:01.160
In order
for that amount of power...

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:02.620
to be contained...

01:33:02.703 --> 01:33:04.664
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

01:33:04.789 --> 01:33:06.958
There is one. Precinct 47.

01:33:07.541 --> 01:33:08.793
Here.

01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:10.836
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

01:33:10.962 --> 01:33:13.923
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:15.800
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

01:33:15.883 --> 01:33:17.218
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

01:33:17.343 --> 01:33:18.678
They have defensive shields...

01:33:18.761 --> 01:33:20.721
that our ships cannot penetrate.

01:33:20.846 --> 01:33:22.264
We disable the shields.

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:24.016
Kid, you worked there.

01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:25.142
What do you got?

01:33:25.226 --> 01:33:26.435
I can do it.

01:33:26.519 --> 01:33:27.770
I like this guy.

01:33:27.895 --> 01:33:29.772
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

01:33:29.855 --> 01:33:31.315
On the planet.

01:33:31.399 --> 01:33:33.025
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

01:33:33.776 --> 01:33:35.277
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

01:33:35.403 --> 01:33:37.279
So we disable the shields...

01:33:37.363 --> 01:33:39.657
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

01:33:39.782 --> 01:33:41.867
All right. Let's go.

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:05.891
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

01:34:05.975 --> 01:34:07.476
Come on. Let's go.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.770
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

01:34:09.895 --> 01:34:10.938
Now you tell me?

01:34:11.063 --> 01:34:14.275
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:18.029
I've always hated watching you leave.

01:34:18.112 --> 01:34:19.321
That's why I did it.

01:34:20.573 --> 01:34:22.074
So you'd miss me.

01:34:24.827 --> 01:34:26.620
I did miss you.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.874
It wasn't all bad, was it?

01:34:29.957 --> 01:34:31.042
Huh?

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:34.253
Some of it was... good.

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.088
Pretty good.

01:34:39.425 --> 01:34:42.303
- Some things never change.
- True.

01:34:42.845 --> 01:34:44.847
You still drive me crazy.

01:34:54.023 --> 01:34:55.941
If you see our son...

01:34:58.444 --> 01:35:00.112
bring him home.

01:35:05.534 --> 01:35:08.204
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar</i> 7 <i>18.</i>

01:35:08.287 --> 01:35:09.955
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

01:35:10.039 --> 01:35:12.166
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:13.959
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

01:35:14.043 --> 01:35:15.711
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.426
<i>All sentry droids...</i>

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:23.719
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

01:35:23.803 --> 01:35:26.055
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

01:35:26.138 --> 01:35:28.140
<i>Offset 473.</i>

01:35:30.893 --> 01:35:31.977
How are we getting in?

01:35:32.103 --> 01:35:34.063
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

01:35:34.146 --> 01:35:35.815
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:37.316
from getting through.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.985
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:42.530
Chewie, get ready.

01:35:43.823 --> 01:35:44.990
And... Now!

01:35:48.911 --> 01:35:50.579
I am pulling up!

01:35:57.294 --> 01:35:58.921
I get any higher...

01:35:59.004 --> 01:36:00.256
they'll see us!

01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:24.572
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

01:36:24.697 --> 01:36:25.817
But all troops are on alert.

01:36:25.865 --> 01:36:27.241
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

01:36:27.366 --> 01:36:29.086
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

01:36:31.662 --> 01:36:33.205
<i>Han Solo.</i>

01:36:44.425 --> 01:36:46.135
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:47.469
We'll get in that way.

01:36:47.553 --> 01:36:49.471
What was your job
when you were based here?

01:36:49.555 --> 01:36:50.556
Sanitation.

01:36:53.434 --> 01:36:55.144
Sanitation?

01:36:55.227 --> 01:36:56.937
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

01:36:57.062 --> 01:36:58.063
I don't.

01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:59.940
I'm just here to get Rey.

01:37:00.065 --> 01:37:03.652
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

01:37:03.736 --> 01:37:05.070
Solo, we'll figure it out.

01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:07.448
We'll use the Force.

01:37:07.573 --> 01:37:09.658
That's not how the Force works.

01:37:11.243 --> 01:37:13.787
Oh, really? You're cold?

01:37:13.954 --> 01:37:14.955
Come on.

01:37:22.379 --> 01:37:23.672
Report.

01:37:23.756 --> 01:37:25.966
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

01:37:28.427 --> 01:37:29.428
<i>Hey!</i>

01:37:32.598 --> 01:37:34.808
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

01:37:34.934 --> 01:37:37.436
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:47.863
- You remember me?
<i>- FN-2187.</i>

01:37:47.947 --> 01:37:49.198
Not anymore.

01:37:49.365 --> 01:37:50.725
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

01:37:50.783 --> 01:37:52.826
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:54.912
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

01:37:54.995 --> 01:37:56.121
Follow me.

01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:10.761
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-17s?</i>

01:38:10.844 --> 01:38:12.513
<i>The T-17s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

01:38:12.638 --> 01:38:13.681
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

01:38:13.806 --> 01:38:15.641
<i>Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

01:38:15.766 --> 01:38:16.976
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:18.602
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

01:38:54.305 --> 01:38:56.056
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.266
Lower the shields.

01:38:57.349 --> 01:38:59.184
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:01.395
Do it.

01:39:05.649 --> 01:39:06.775
Solo, if this works...

01:39:06.859 --> 01:39:09.111
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

01:39:09.194 --> 01:39:10.571
Don't worry, kid.

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:12.781
We won't leave here without her.

01:39:14.575 --> 01:39:17.453
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

01:39:17.536 --> 01:39:20.122
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

01:39:20.205 --> 01:39:22.041
I disagree. What do we do with her?

01:39:22.666 --> 01:39:24.209
Is there a garbage chute?

01:39:24.877 --> 01:39:26.211
Trash compactor?

01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:28.464
Yeah, there is.

01:39:28.797 --> 01:39:30.341
General, their shields are down.

01:39:30.424 --> 01:39:32.009
Thank the Maker!

01:39:32.092 --> 01:39:33.844
Han did it. Send them in.

01:39:33.927 --> 01:39:35.846
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

01:39:35.929 --> 01:39:38.223
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

01:39:38.307 --> 01:39:39.308
Roger, base.

01:39:39.391 --> 01:39:41.101
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:43.312
Dropping out of lightspeed.

01:39:57.076 --> 01:39:58.577
<i>Almost in range.</i>

01:39:58.744 --> 01:40:01.497
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:03.457
Approaching target.

01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:08.879
Fighters incoming!

01:40:09.755 --> 01:40:11.340
<i>Coming at 28.336.</i>

01:40:11.423 --> 01:40:13.217
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.968
Dispatch all squadrons.

01:40:15.094 --> 01:40:16.595
Yes, General.

01:40:17.429 --> 01:40:18.589
All right. Let's light it up.

01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:30.275
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

01:40:30.359 --> 01:40:31.610
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

01:40:31.777 --> 01:40:33.070
Another bombing run.

01:40:33.195 --> 01:40:35.906
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

01:40:35.989 --> 01:40:38.575
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

01:40:40.285 --> 01:40:41.829
Guys, we got a lot of company!

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.087
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

01:40:50.170 --> 01:40:52.131
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

01:40:59.972 --> 01:41:01.974
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:04.810
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

01:41:04.893 --> 01:41:06.013
You sure you're up for this?

01:41:06.061 --> 01:41:07.271
Hell, no.

01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:08.647
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:09.940
The troopers will be on our tail.

01:41:10.023 --> 01:41:12.151
We have to be ready for that.

01:41:12.234 --> 01:41:14.027
There's an access tunnel that leads...

01:41:14.111 --> 01:41:16.655
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

01:41:16.738 --> 01:41:18.098
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

01:41:34.798 --> 01:41:36.383
You all right?

01:41:36.467 --> 01:41:38.093
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:41:38.177 --> 01:41:39.761
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

01:41:39.845 --> 01:41:41.221
Finn, what are you doing here?

01:41:41.346 --> 01:41:43.432
We came back for you.

01:41:44.308 --> 01:41:45.851
What'd he say?

01:41:45.934 --> 01:41:47.311
That it was your idea.

01:41:51.106 --> 01:41:52.191
Thank you.

01:41:56.069 --> 01:41:57.654
How did you get away?

01:41:57.738 --> 01:41:58.780
I can't explain it.

01:41:58.864 --> 01:42:00.949
And you wouldn't believe it.

01:42:01.033 --> 01:42:03.368
Escape now, hug later.

01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:20.093
I got one behind me.

01:42:20.219 --> 01:42:21.595
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:32.189
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

01:42:36.985 --> 01:42:38.946
They're in trouble.

01:42:39.029 --> 01:42:40.447
We can't leave.

01:42:42.241 --> 01:42:45.244
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

01:42:45.327 --> 01:42:46.995
Let's use them.

01:42:47.079 --> 01:42:48.455
General, are you seeing this?

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:49.915
Two more X-wings down.

01:42:49.998 --> 01:42:52.376
That's half our fleet destroyed.

01:42:52.459 --> 01:42:55.128
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

01:42:55.212 --> 01:42:57.339
It would take a miracle to save us now.

01:43:23.782 --> 01:43:24.783
Ah.

01:43:24.866 --> 01:43:27.202
Girl knows her stuff.

01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:38.630
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.800
You're right. That's a better idea.

01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:43.885
You take the top. I'll go down below.

01:43:43.969 --> 01:43:45.637
Detonator.

01:43:45.721 --> 01:43:47.389
We'll meet back here.

01:44:32.809 --> 01:44:33.810
<i>Find them.</i>

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.581
Ben!

01:45:49.344 --> 01:45:50.470
<i>Han Solo.</i>

01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:54.057
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

01:46:13.326 --> 01:46:16.830
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

01:46:17.414 --> 01:46:19.291
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

01:46:19.416 --> 01:46:21.668
The face of my son.

01:46:43.523 --> 01:46:45.692
Your son is gone.

01:46:46.985 --> 01:46:49.321
He was weak and foolish like his father.

01:46:49.488 --> 01:46:51.239
So I destroyed him.

01:46:53.325 --> 01:46:55.702
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

01:46:56.953 --> 01:46:58.663
But it's not true.

01:46:59.998 --> 01:47:02.083
My son is alive.

01:47:02.167 --> 01:47:03.627
No.

01:47:03.710 --> 01:47:05.921
The Supreme Leader is wise.

01:47:06.004 --> 01:47:08.757
Snoke is using you for your power.

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.634
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

01:47:15.889 --> 01:47:17.557
You know it's true.

01:47:23.188 --> 01:47:24.189
It's too late.

01:47:24.272 --> 01:47:25.857
No, it's not.

01:47:25.941 --> 01:47:27.692
Leave here with me. Come home.

01:47:29.444 --> 01:47:30.862
We miss you.

01:47:39.579 --> 01:47:41.706
I'm being torn apart.

01:47:44.543 --> 01:47:46.711
I want to be free of this pain.

01:47:52.133 --> 01:47:53.213
I know what I have to do...

01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:55.387
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

01:47:59.307 --> 01:48:00.392
Will you help me?

01:48:00.475 --> 01:48:02.310
Yes. Anything.

01:48:50.609 --> 01:48:53.445
No!

01:49:00.368 --> 01:49:01.620
Thank you.

01:49:09.127 --> 01:49:10.128
No.

01:50:25.453 --> 01:50:27.038
The oscillator's been damaged...

01:50:27.122 --> 01:50:28.873
but is still functional.

01:50:28.957 --> 01:50:31.459
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

01:50:42.721 --> 01:50:44.180
The <i>Falcon's</i> this way.

01:51:05.076 --> 01:51:06.411
We're not done yet.

01:51:09.581 --> 01:51:11.416
You're a monster.

01:51:11.541 --> 01:51:13.418
It's just us now.

01:51:14.586 --> 01:51:16.087
Han Solo can't save you.

01:51:24.888 --> 01:51:26.681
Rey!

01:51:29.476 --> 01:51:30.977
Rey.

01:51:31.061 --> 01:51:32.062
Rey!

01:51:33.897 --> 01:51:35.523
Oh, no. No, no.

01:51:35.607 --> 01:51:36.608
Rey.

01:51:38.818 --> 01:51:40.361
Traitor!

01:51:50.914 --> 01:51:52.457
That lightsaber.

01:51:53.583 --> 01:51:54.626
It belongs to me.

01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:56.377
Come get it.

01:53:44.194 --> 01:53:45.278
We just lost <i>R-1.</i>

01:53:45.904 --> 01:53:47.197
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.573
What do we do? It isn't working.

01:53:49.324 --> 01:53:51.605
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

01:53:52.577 --> 01:53:54.495
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

01:53:55.121 --> 01:53:56.998
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:58.249
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

01:53:58.333 --> 01:53:59.876
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

01:53:59.959 --> 01:54:01.039
Give it everything you got.

01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:15.266
I need some help here.
I need some help!

01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:16.601
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:19.062
I'm hit!

01:54:24.567 --> 01:54:26.486
All teams, I'm going in.

01:54:26.611 --> 01:54:27.779
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

01:54:27.862 --> 01:54:29.614
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

01:54:35.745 --> 01:54:37.622
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

01:54:39.123 --> 01:54:40.291
Prepare to fire.

01:56:13.384 --> 01:56:14.802
You need a teacher.

01:56:16.679 --> 01:56:18.473
I could show you the ways of the Force.

01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.185
The Force?

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.378
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

01:58:12.462 --> 01:58:14.046
We're losing power rapidly!

01:58:16.424 --> 01:58:18.342
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

01:58:18.426 --> 01:58:21.721
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

01:58:21.846 --> 01:58:23.347
Supreme Leader.

01:58:24.223 --> 01:58:26.184
The fuel cells have ruptured.

01:58:26.267 --> 01:58:28.394
The collapse of the planet has begun.

01:58:28.603 --> 01:58:32.648
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

01:58:33.733 --> 01:58:35.610
It is time...

01:58:35.693 --> 01:58:38.029
to complete his training.

01:58:40.364 --> 01:58:41.365
Finn!

01:58:42.116 --> 01:58:43.326
Finn.

01:59:32.458 --> 01:59:35.545
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

01:59:58.484 --> 02:00:01.612
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

02:00:16.794 --> 02:00:19.130
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

02:00:19.255 --> 02:00:20.464
We've got a heartbeat.

02:01:22.526 --> 02:01:24.153
R2-D2!

02:01:25.029 --> 02:01:26.030
You've come back.

02:01:29.992 --> 02:01:31.410
You found what?

02:01:31.535 --> 02:01:33.537
How dare you call me that!

02:01:35.915 --> 02:01:38.000
Find Master Luke, how?

02:01:38.084 --> 02:01:39.126
Come, R2.

02:01:39.210 --> 02:01:41.212
We must go tell the others at once!

02:01:42.546 --> 02:01:43.631
General.

02:01:43.714 --> 02:01:45.883
Excuse me, General.

02:01:50.471 --> 02:01:52.973
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

02:01:53.641 --> 02:01:55.101
Tell me.

02:02:05.486 --> 02:02:06.904
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

02:02:21.335 --> 02:02:22.962
The map, it is complete.

02:02:23.587 --> 02:02:25.256
Luke.

02:02:25.339 --> 02:02:26.924
Oh, my dear friend...

02:02:27.049 --> 02:02:28.592
how I've missed you.

02:02:45.568 --> 02:02:47.611
We'll see each other again.

02:02:47.695 --> 02:02:49.613
I believe that.

02:02:57.788 --> 02:02:59.582
Thank you, my friend.

02:03:14.472 --> 02:03:16.307
Rey.

02:03:17.975 --> 02:03:20.770
May the Force be with you.
