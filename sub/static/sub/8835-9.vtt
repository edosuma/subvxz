28:07.479 --> 28:09.272

Mary: HI, PA!

28:41.721 --> 28:42.639
HOW YOU DOING, GIRLS?

28:42.806 --> 28:44.182
FINE.

28:44.349 --> 28:48.103
CAROLINE, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
HAD A BIG ORDER TO FILL.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.187
HOW DID IT GO TODAY?

28:49.354 --> 28:51.856
WONDERFUL. I NEVER
HAD A BETTER DAY.

28:52.023 --> 28:55.360
IT WORKED, CHARLES. IT REALLY WORKED.
TOMORROW...

28:55.527 --> 28:57.654
THAT'S WHAT I
LIKE TO HEAR.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.451

29:03.618 --> 29:05.537

29:23.054 --> 29:26.224
"B...B...BOAT."

29:26.391 --> 29:28.810
WELL, HMM.

29:28.977 --> 29:33.440
I DECLARE, WHEN MY CHILDREN
CAME HOME AND TOLD ME,

29:33.606 --> 29:36.317
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

29:37.569 --> 29:40.363
BELIEVE WHAT,
MRS. OLESON?

29:41.239 --> 29:42.407
Mrs. Oleson: THIS,

29:42.574 --> 29:44.576
EXACTLY THIS--

29:44.742 --> 29:47.745
THAT YOU HAVE STOPPED
TEACHING THE CHILDREN

29:47.912 --> 29:49.122
TO PAMPER YOUR FAVORITE,

29:49.289 --> 29:51.416
TO BABY ONE PUPIL,

29:51.583 --> 29:54.502
THIS--THIS--THIS--
DUMB ABEL PERSON HERE.

29:54.669 --> 29:57.130
WHY, HE SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE IN SCHOOL.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.591
LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S AS BIG AS I AM.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.718
CHILDREN.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.808
CAN ANY OF YOU
SPELL COMPASSION?

30:18.401 --> 30:21.404
CAN ANY OF YOU
SPELL UNDERSTANDING?

30:31.372 --> 30:35.418
WILL ANY OF YOU TELL US
THE MEANINGS OF THESE WORDS?

30:39.631 --> 30:41.299
WELL, DON'T FEEL BAD,
CHILDREN.

30:41.466 --> 30:46.054
I DON'T THINK MRS. OLESON KNOWS THE
MEANINGS OF THESE WORDS EITHER.

30:46.221 --> 30:51.059
WELL, REALLY! I HAPPEN TO
BE A MEMBER OF THE BOARD.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.145
SCHOOL IS DISMISSED,
CHILDREN.

30:54.312 --> 30:58.316
THERE WILL BE NO MORE SCHOOL
UNTIL ANOTHER TEACHER IS FOUND.

31:18.628 --> 31:21.506
WHOA.

31:21.673 --> 31:24.092
I TAKE IT YOU'RE
HERE TO SEE MY WIFE.

31:24.259 --> 31:25.301
Mr. Hanson:
WHERE IS SHE?

31:25.468 --> 31:27.929
AROUND THE SIDE
OF THE HOUSE, THERE.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.948
Dr. Baker:
MRS. INGALLS.

31:48.366 --> 31:49.951
MRS. INGALLS.

32:05.758 --> 32:09.554
MRS. INGALLS,
AS YOU CAN SEE,

32:09.721 --> 32:13.558
WE ARE HERE WITH OUR
HATS IN OUR HANDS

32:13.725 --> 32:16.644
TO BEG YOU, PLEASE,
TO RECONSIDER.

32:16.811 --> 32:19.772
WE'D VERY MUCH LIKE YOU
TO GO ON TEACHING.

32:19.939 --> 32:22.734
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

32:24.569 --> 32:26.404
WELL, WE'VE HEARD, UH...

32:26.571 --> 32:29.949
WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY
CONFLICTING REPORTS.

32:30.116 --> 32:33.369
WOULD YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:36.789 --> 32:40.627
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT IF I ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION WITH ANOTHER QUESTION?

32:40.793 --> 32:44.881
YOU BET YOU. YOU ASK
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.344
SUPPOSE YOU WERE
AT WORK IN YOUR MILL,

32:49.510 --> 32:51.095
GRINDING WHEAT INTO FLOUR,

32:51.262 --> 32:52.597
MAKING A SPECIAL EFFORT,

32:52.764 --> 32:54.557
AND SOMEONE
CAME IN UNINVITED--

32:54.724 --> 32:57.310
I DON'T ALLOW ANYONE
IN THE GRINDING ROOM

32:57.477 --> 33:01.272
WHEN I AM WORKING.
THAT IS MY RULE.

33:01.439 --> 33:04.484
SUPPOSE THIS PERSON
CAME IN ANYWAY,

33:04.651 --> 33:06.277
AND WHILE THERE,

33:06.444 --> 33:09.447
TOOK A ROCK AND THREW IT
BETWEEN THE MILLSTONES

33:09.614 --> 33:12.867
AND RUINED
ALL YOU WERE TRYING TO DO.

33:14.202 --> 33:15.870
I WOULD TAKE
THAT PERSON

33:16.037 --> 33:17.830
BY THE BACK
OF THE COLLAR

33:17.997 --> 33:19.332
AND THE SEAT
OF THE PANTS,

33:19.499 --> 33:21.334
AND I WOULD THROW
HIM RIGHT OUT

33:21.501 --> 33:23.378
INTO THE MIDDLE
OF THE STREET!

33:26.964 --> 33:29.801
THAT IDEA
DID OCCUR TO ME,

33:29.967 --> 33:32.762
BUT UNHAPPILY,
I AM A LADY,

33:32.929 --> 33:35.765
AND THIS PERSON
WAS ALSO A LADY.

33:37.308 --> 33:41.979
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED, LIKE
A ROCK BETWEEN MILLSTONES?

33:42.146 --> 33:45.316
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO
WAS DESTROYED

33:45.483 --> 33:47.694
IN MUCH THE SAME WAY.

33:51.906 --> 33:54.409
DO YOU WANT TO TELL THEM
ABOUT IT, MRS. OLESON?

33:58.037 --> 33:59.747
WELL, UH...

33:59.914 --> 34:04.419
IT WASN'T ANYTHING
AS SERIOUS AS THAT.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.838
REALLY.

34:07.004 --> 34:10.174
I WAS--I WAS JUST, UH...

34:10.341 --> 34:15.638
WELL, CERTAINLY A MOTHER HAS A
RIGHT TO ATTEND A SCHOOL...UH...

34:15.805 --> 34:18.349
UH...WELL, ALL I DID--

34:18.516 --> 34:22.186
WELL, I MEAN,
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS...

34:22.353 --> 34:26.733
TO POINT OUT THAT ONE PUPIL
SHOULDN'T GET SPECIAL ATTENTION,

34:26.899 --> 34:30.486
UH, AT THE EXPENSE
OF THE OTHERS.

34:30.653 --> 34:33.614
YOU INTERFERED.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.701
IS THAT
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:36.868 --> 34:40.747
ONE OF MY PUPILS RAN OUT.
HE WAS SO HUMILIATED.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.417
I DON'T THINK
HE'LL EVER COME BACK.

34:45.877 --> 34:50.631
OLESON, WOULD YOU TAKE
YOUR WIFE BY THE BACK OF--

34:50.798 --> 34:55.136
WOULD YOU TAKE YOUR WIFE AND WAIT
FOR US IN THE SURREY, PLEASE?

34:55.303 --> 34:56.345
OH.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.973
YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH TROUBLE.
COME ON.

35:04.061 --> 35:08.357
IF WE PROMISE THERE WILL
BE NO MORE INTERFERENCE,

35:08.524 --> 35:11.903
WOULD YOU COME BACK?

35:12.069 --> 35:15.239
I PERSONALLY
GUARANTEE IT.

35:16.741 --> 35:21.412
NOW THAT I'VE LOST THE
PUPIL WHO NEEDS ME MOST...

35:21.579 --> 35:24.582
I DON'T THINK I COULD
BE A GOOD TEACHER.

35:25.666 --> 35:28.294
I'M SORRY.

35:51.651 --> 35:52.819
IS THAT LIGHT
BOTHERING YOU?

35:52.985 --> 35:55.029
NO. NOT AT ALL.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.450
THIS IS
REALLY A GOOD BOOK.

35:59.617 --> 36:00.785
I'M READING
A CHAPTER RIGHT HERE

36:00.952 --> 36:02.036
TELLS YOU HOW TO
MAKE YOUR OWN PAINT.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.372
ARE YOU GOING
TO PAINT TOMORROW?

36:04.539 --> 36:06.749
NO, I WASN'T GOING
TO PAINT TOMORROW.

36:06.916 --> 36:11.879
THEN DO YOU HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO MAKE PAINT TONIGHT?

36:12.046 --> 36:14.048
THE LIGHT
IS BOTHERING YOU.

36:20.638 --> 36:24.684
IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY.

36:25.726 --> 36:29.188
I KNOW. THAT WHOLE
SCHOOL BUSINESS

36:29.355 --> 36:30.481
HAS BEEN KIND OF
UPSETTING, HASN'T IT?

36:30.648 --> 36:32.900
I'M ALWAYS UPSET
WHEN I LOSE MY TEMPER.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.570
[CHUCKLES]

36:35.736 --> 36:40.157
WELL, IT'S OVER NOW.
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST.

36:40.324 --> 36:44.662
I PROBABLY NEVER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE.

36:44.829 --> 36:49.000
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.294
NOW, GET SOME SLEEP.

37:01.554 --> 37:04.098
Charles: I SAW
CHRISTY'S FATHER TODAY.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.350
OH, WHAT ABOUT HIM?

37:06.517 --> 37:07.852
OH, NOTHING.

37:08.019 --> 37:11.022
HE JUST SAID THERE'S GOING
TO BE SCHOOL TOMORROW.

37:11.188 --> 37:13.232
MRS. OLESON'S
GOING TO TEACH.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.026
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

37:15.192 --> 37:16.152
WELL, I'M JUST
TELLING YOU

37:16.319 --> 37:18.696
WHAT CHRISTY'S
FATHER TOLD ME.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.865
WELL, LAURA AND MARY
AREN'T GOING.

37:21.032 --> 37:23.159
WHAT SHE HAS TO TEACH,
THEY DON'T NEED TO LEARN.

37:23.326 --> 37:24.201
I AGREE.

37:24.368 --> 37:25.828
GOOD.

37:30.708 --> 37:33.085
IF EVER THERE WAS A PERSON
UNFIT TO TEACH SCHOOL,

37:33.252 --> 37:34.795
IT IS MRS. OLESON.

37:34.962 --> 37:37.590
IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE LOST MY TEMPER AND QUIT.

37:37.757 --> 37:41.886
CAROLINE, YOU JUST GOT THROUGH
TELLING ME IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST.

37:42.053 --> 37:46.307
WHERE MRS. OLESON IS CONCERNED,
NOTHING IS FOR THE BEST.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.649
CHARLES...

37:54.815 --> 37:57.652
IS THERE
ANY POPCORN LEFT?

38:01.530 --> 38:03.616
THANKS.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.079
GOOD NIGHT.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.373
GOOD NIGHT.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.178
WELL, LOOK AT YOU,
MRS. INGALLS.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.304
PRETTY AS
A SPECKLED BIRD.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.391
THANK YOU.
I WON'T BE LONG.

38:28.557 --> 38:31.268
CAROLINE!
JUST ONE THING.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.980
REMEMBER, THE EGGS ARE FOR
SELLING, NOT FOR THROWING.

38:38.818 --> 38:40.903
WELL, GOOD MORNING,
MRS. INGALLS.

38:41.070 --> 38:41.862
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

38:42.029 --> 38:43.155
FINE, THANK YOU.
YOURSELF?

38:43.322 --> 38:44.949
OH, NEVER BETTER.
NEVER BETTER.

38:45.116 --> 38:46.450
WELL, WHAT DO I
OWE YOU FOR THE EGGS?

38:46.617 --> 38:48.035
AREN'T YOU GOING TO COUNT
THEM AND PRICE THEM?

38:48.202 --> 38:49.453
MRS. OLESON
ALWAYS DOES.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.580
WELL, SHE'S
NOT HERE TODAY. SHE--

38:51.747 --> 38:54.291
WELL, ANYWAY, I'LL TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR THE COUNT

38:54.458 --> 38:57.461
AND THE PRICE
IS THE SAME AS LAST TIME.

38:57.628 --> 39:00.172
YOU KNOW I'M NOT
TEACHING NOW.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.800
WELL, WHAT HAS THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

39:02.967 --> 39:06.512
MRS. OLESON SEEMED TO FEEL IT HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PRICE.

39:06.679 --> 39:08.806
OH, NO. NO, NO,
NOTHING LIKE THAT,

39:08.973 --> 39:11.100
ANYWAY NOT WITH ME.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.393
ALL RIGHT, MR. OLESON.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.187
YOU OWE ME 56 CENTS,
AND I'LL SPEND IT NOW.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.690
[BELL RINGING]

39:29.368 --> 39:33.247
[BELL RINGS]

39:39.336 --> 39:41.005
AH.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.467
DIDN'T YOU
TELL THE CHILDREN

39:44.633 --> 39:46.052
THAT I WAS GOING
TO TEACH TODAY?

39:46.218 --> 39:49.096
WE DID.
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

40:02.568 --> 40:06.489
ABEL! IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.199
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

40:08.365 --> 40:09.658
WAITING FOR YOU,
MRS. INGALLS.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.994
MR. INGALLS TOLD ME YOU'D
BE COMING THIS WAY.

40:12.161 --> 40:16.207
WELL, FINE. LET'S SIT DOWN
IN THE SHADE, SHALL WE?

40:16.373 --> 40:19.293
IT'S GETTING WARM, AND
I'VE BEEN WALKING FAST.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.886
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING WITH YOURSELF?

40:29.053 --> 40:31.388
WELL, I, UH...

40:33.891 --> 40:37.561
FIRST I WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY
FOR THE WAY I RUN OFF.

40:37.728 --> 40:42.942
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

40:43.109 --> 40:45.027
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU GO BACK.

40:45.194 --> 40:46.821
OH, I AIN'T
GOIN' BACK.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.615
THAT'S DONE,
FINISHED.

40:49.782 --> 40:51.951
I'M TOO OLD.
IT'S NO USE.

40:52.118 --> 40:53.035
BUT, ABEL-.

40:53.202 --> 40:55.996
MA'AM,
MY MIND'S MADE UP.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.251
WHAT I DONE WAS--

41:00.417 --> 41:04.380
WELL, YOU WERE
SO GOOD TO ME,

41:04.547 --> 41:06.423
AND I DIDN'T
WORK OUT.

41:06.590 --> 41:11.804
I WANTED TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU SOME WAY.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.264
I MADE SOMETHING.

41:13.430 --> 41:16.809
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE IT TO
HELP TEACH THE OTHER KIDS.

41:16.976 --> 41:19.311
IT AIN'T THAT MUCH,
BUT...

41:24.608 --> 41:26.735
ABEL...

41:27.987 --> 41:29.280
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

41:29.446 --> 41:30.823
YOU LIKE IT?

41:30.990 --> 41:34.076
I MADE A FEW UP.

41:34.243 --> 41:36.036
I'LL MAKE
THE WHOLE ALPHABET.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.622
I'LL MAKE THE NUMBERS,
TOO, IF YOU LIKE.

41:38.789 --> 41:41.500
ABEL, DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

41:41.667 --> 41:43.961
IN JUST
THE LITTLE TIME WE HAD,

41:44.128 --> 41:46.297
LETTERS AND NUMBERS
HAVE GOTTEN INTO YOUR HEAD,

41:46.463 --> 41:51.302
AND YOU'RE NOT EVER GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GET THEM OUT AGAIN NOW, NOT EVER.

41:51.468 --> 41:53.304
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:53.470 --> 41:55.514
YOU'RE CAUGHT, ABEL.

41:55.681 --> 41:59.059
YOU CAN'T
HELP YOURSELF NOW.

41:59.226 --> 42:02.563
YOU'RE GOING
TO LEARN TO READ

42:02.730 --> 42:05.191
AND WRITE,
AND FIGURE...

42:05.357 --> 42:09.403
AND SO MANY
MORE THINGS.

42:11.030 --> 42:14.950
BUT IT'S LATE, ABEL. YOU CAN'T
AFFORD TO WASTE ANOTHER DAY.

42:15.117 --> 42:16.702
YOU'VE GOT
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

42:16.869 --> 42:19.705
OH, NO, MA'AM.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

42:19.872 --> 42:22.625
THAT'S ONE THING
I WON'T DO.

42:22.791 --> 42:25.002
IT'S NO USE.

42:30.299 --> 42:31.508
THAT DON'T MEAN

42:31.675 --> 42:34.678
YOU CAN'T TAKE THESE
LETTERS, AND...

42:34.845 --> 42:36.931
YES, IT DOES.

42:38.349 --> 42:39.934
WHY?

42:41.185 --> 42:44.688
BECAUSE WHEN YOU RAN
AWAY, I RAN AWAY, TOO.

42:44.855 --> 42:45.689
YOU?

42:45.856 --> 42:48.442
WHY?

42:48.609 --> 42:52.112
WHEN I LOST YOU, I DECIDED I
WASN'T FIT TO BE A TEACHER.
