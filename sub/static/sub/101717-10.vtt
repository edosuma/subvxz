WEBVTT

00:36.304 --> 00:38.139
It's done. He's down.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.527
He's on board. Tell her we're
en route, 10 minutes out.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.751
They say the Heretic's Fork
exposes the sinner.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.754
Makes him
renounce his sins.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.057
What do
you renounce,
Mr. Bracker?

02:38.759 --> 02:39.593
Hmm?

02:41.662 --> 02:42.596
Let me help you.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.172
Your cartel's expanded
into territory
that isn't yours.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.310
My employer
can't allow that.

02:56.910 --> 02:57.845
We'll stop.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.315
We'll stop.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.617
Oh, I know
you'll stop.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.786
As of this moment,

03:07.321 --> 03:08.522
you're out
of business,

03:08.656 --> 03:11.592
but that's not
why you're here.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.761
You're going to tell me
all the relevant details

03:13.894 --> 03:15.028
of your operation.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.198
Every runner,
every financier...

03:20.668 --> 03:21.635
He says
it can't wait.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.504
Hmm.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.638
I'll be with you
shortly.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.343
I was just
about to phone you.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.544
We're ready to
start the uplink.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.746
Change of plans.
What does that mean?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.982
It means
I need you here
in the U.S.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.584
It's, uh...

03:36.717 --> 03:38.886
It's a matter
of some urgency.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.251
You can't be here.
They'll see you.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.824
I once dropped acid
with Allen Ginsberg.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.760
We spent a glorious
afternoon in Soho,

04:21.329 --> 04:22.896
just tumbling.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.233
I know what you want,
but I can't help you.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.068
I miss that gentleness.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.208
<i>** Summer winds</i>
are softly blowing **

04:35.343 --> 04:38.078
You're a service
provider, Bobby.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.914
I put you on the payroll
to provide a service,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.617
information on Townsend.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.420
You're laundering
his money
out of a laundromat,

04:46.554 --> 04:49.089
which is in itself
entertaining,

04:49.222 --> 04:51.224
but I also know
you're skimming
off the top.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.760
That's not true.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.828
Oh, you're definitely
stealing from Townsend.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.097
And while I admire
your chutzpah,

04:57.230 --> 05:00.534
I can't help but think that
if I know you're stealing
from Townsend...

05:00.668 --> 05:03.303
it's just
a matter of time.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.741
So, tell me
where I can find him

05:07.875 --> 05:10.310
or where I can
find someone who can.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.312
I don't know
where he is.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.152
But I know
where his money goes.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.955
Once it's cleaned,
I make a series
of deposits.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.457
Who gets
the biggest one?

05:24.858 --> 05:25.759
A woman.

05:27.194 --> 05:27.961
Laken Perillos.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.863
Perillos.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.765
The Brazen Bull.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.667
What?
Go on.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.335
I don't know
who Perillos is,

05:35.469 --> 05:38.138
but I assume
that if you could
get to her,

05:38.271 --> 05:39.507
she could help you
find Townsend.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.341
And where is she?

05:41.475 --> 05:42.209
In the States.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.045
I was told
that she came in
last night.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.481
That's all
that I know.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.585
That was Ruddiger.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.186
He thinks he has
something for us.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.589
You know
what they call
a money launderer

05:55.723 --> 05:56.657
who can't be trusted?

05:57.458 --> 05:58.659
A bad investment.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.461
Get out of here.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.698
I have a lead.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.767
Townsend.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.802
An arrest warrant
has been issued
for Elizabeth.

06:09.803 --> 06:10.771
That's a mistake.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
No. It's a tragedy.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.942
<i>I can tell you</i>
<i>how to get</i>
to Townsend.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.177
The only person I'm focused
on getting to is Elizabeth.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.179
<i>I don't see how</i>
<i>that's helped by going</i>
after the person

06:19.312 --> 06:20.548
<i>whose sister</i>
she killed.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.717
Elizabeth killed Mary Bremmer
at Townsend's instruction.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.318
Townsend wanted
his sister killed?

06:25.453 --> 06:27.120
No, but you had her
in custody,

06:27.254 --> 06:29.790
so he ordered the hit
to keep her from talking.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.325
And as a test
of Elizabeth's
allegiance.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.662
Keen and Townsend
are allies?

06:34.795 --> 06:35.829
I thought
she wanted him dead.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.865
A desire
she's put on hold

06:37.998 --> 06:39.900
so they can join forces
and come after me.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.370
So if I follow your lead
and go after Townsend,

06:43.504 --> 06:44.838
<i>I could get</i>
to Elizabeth?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.910
Tell me, Harold, what do you
know about the Brazen Bull?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.481
A metal bull,
used to torture
and execute people?

06:53.614 --> 06:55.248
According to legend, yes.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.850
The condemned
were locked inside

06:56.984 --> 06:58.251
while a fire
was set beneath it.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.753
That is brazen,

06:59.887 --> 07:01.822
but how's a Greek
torture device
relevant to us?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.757
The bull was invented
by Perillos of Athens,

07:03.891 --> 07:05.158
a student of pain

07:05.292 --> 07:07.761
and the eponymous
namesake of
Laken Perillos,

07:07.895 --> 07:09.362
<i>the woman</i>
<i>Neville Townsend</i>
employs

07:09.497 --> 07:12.199
<i>to inflict pain</i>
<i>on his victims</i>
to extract information.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.802
Reddington believes
Perillos can lead us
to Townsend

07:14.935 --> 07:16.504
and Townsend
can lead us
to Keen.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.971
Not after she killed
his sister.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.708
Apparently that's what
Townsend wanted her to do,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.075
as a test
of her loyalty.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.077
Mr. Reddington says
Liz is working
with Townsend?

07:26.514 --> 07:27.581
This is impossible.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.449
I hope you're right.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.284
But there's only one way
to find out.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.786
What do we know
about Perillos?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.789
Very little.
Except that she's
brutal and effective.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.058
She came
onto the scene
six years ago.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.061
At that time,
Antonio Bastinado,
Dominic Morgan,

07:41.194 --> 07:43.363
and Andres Gataki
controlled the ships

07:43.497 --> 07:46.166
that carried
nearly all the contraband
coming through the Bosporus.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.536
How they managed it was
a tightly guarded secret

07:48.669 --> 07:50.103
until Perillos
got hold of them.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.539
Now they're dead.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.106
Townsend controls
the strait,

07:53.240 --> 07:56.544
and examples
of Perillos' handiwork
keep people in line.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.245
Liz doesn't know
Townsend sanctioned this.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.113
I mean,
she can't know, right?

08:00.247 --> 08:02.082
Did Reddington give you
a lead on Perillos?

08:02.215 --> 08:04.284
He gave me
the one victim
Perillos didn't kill.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.487
Name's Roman Einhorn.
Has an estate
in Westchester.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.924
Reddington says
Perillos left him alive
as a warning to others.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.026
What kind of warning?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.294
Apparently you'll see
when you talk to him.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.296
Or try to.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.637
I told you, this is
a waste of your time.
He doesn't wanna see you.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.405
Well, he doesn't
have a choice.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.108
Mr. Einhorn hasn't
accepted guests
in almost two years.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.778
Ma'am, we're not
his guests. We're the FBI.
He has no choice.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.615
What exactly
did they tell you
about Mr. Einhorn?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.316
We know
he was maimed.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.451
Look, we're just trying
to find the woman
who was responsible.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.856
The gaze interaction
can be slow to respond.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.758
He gets frustrated.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.526
You need to
be patient.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.865
I remember nothing.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.169
Mr. Einhorn,
we understand
your apprehension.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.671
We're trying
to help.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.574
And as he told you,
Mr. Einhorn
doesn't want your help.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.476
Mr. Einhorn,
Dr. Perillos isn't just
mutilating people,

09:03.611 --> 09:05.212
she's murdering them.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.381
We understand that
you're the only person
who survived her torture,

09:08.515 --> 09:10.718
the only one
who's seen her face,

09:10.851 --> 09:12.786
and we need your help
to stop her.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.390
<i>What happened to me</i>
six years ago was a warning,

09:17.524 --> 09:21.629
<i>an illustration to others</i>
who question her limits.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.832
<i>I was told that</i>
if I assist the police,

09:24.965 --> 09:29.369
<i>the doctor would come back</i>
to finish what she started.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.205
<i>This was</i>
her promise to me,

09:32.339 --> 09:36.910
<i>and so, as I said</i>
<i>to you before,</i>
I know nothing.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.190
Ruddiger.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.759
How are you,
my friend?

09:51.892 --> 09:53.026
Raymond, good to
see you. Dembe.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.362
Smells.

09:55.495 --> 09:56.764
What the hell happened
to your hand?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.599
Oh, uh, car door.
I was cooked.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.734
Nearly lost
my pinkie.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.302
You gotta
be careful, Max.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.537
I need you with
all 10 digits.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.173
That does smell.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.208
Yeah.
What did you find?

10:08.341 --> 10:11.645
The car bomb that
killed your man in Lagos
was breathtaking.

10:11.779 --> 10:15.448
Large detonation wave,
secondary explosion.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.584
Our friends
over at A Command

10:17.718 --> 10:20.954
said they found
ammonium nitrate crystals
in the post-blast remains.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.355
That sounds bloody awful.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.792
Yeah.
What's the lead?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.460
A partial print on
the Tamiya connector.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.063
I'll get it
to Cvetko.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.066
Who could do this,
Raymond?

10:34.101 --> 10:35.068
Not Elizabeth,
I'm sure.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.905
Not on her own, no.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.841
I'm afraid Elizabeth
has enlisted
Neville Townsend

10:40.974 --> 10:43.276
to weaponize
the various details

10:43.410 --> 10:46.313
she's come to learn
about my organization.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.483
Cvetko, it's Dembe.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.385
What the hell
is that smell, anyway?

10:52.519 --> 10:53.887
It's dreadful.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.490
Oh, I'm working on
a cyclohexane-based
accelerant.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.127
Low flash point.
Stable.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.630
And a real pain in the butt
to any forensic
chemical analysts.

11:03.764 --> 11:04.497
Thank you, Cvetko.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.533
We'll have it
to you today.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.310
Raymond.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.746
Raymond, I think
you should go.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.686
Raymond, go!

11:26.820 --> 11:27.955
Get him out of here!

11:33.626 --> 11:34.627
Ow!

11:34.762 --> 11:35.495
Go, go, go!

11:42.169 --> 11:43.136
Where is he?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.141
Where he is?
Reddington?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.277
I don't know.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.679
Search the building.
We know he's here.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.546
Get him
in the van!

11:56.917 --> 11:59.019
Warehouse is clear!
No sign!

11:59.152 --> 12:00.553
Forget it.
Let's go!

12:02.189 --> 12:03.156
Put him in,
put him in.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.161
Get in.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.571
<i>We're here now</i>
<i>securing the scene,</i>
but back up.

12:18.705 --> 12:19.907
Tell me exactly
what happened.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.075
<i>It was an ambush.</i>
Heavily armed.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.911
What about a vehicle?
It was a van.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.313
White Ford.
Four or five men.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.181
Faces? Accents?
I don't know.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.183
They were masked,
and I didn't hear
them speak.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.285
But come on,
it was her, Donald.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.921
We don't know that.
You got a lot
of enemies.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.823
Besides,
Keen wouldn't
target Dembe.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.192
I've lost any perspective of
what Agent Keen is capable of.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.694
I only know that
we need to get
Dembe back,

12:41.829 --> 12:44.097
<i>because if he is</i>
<i>in the hands</i>
of Perillos,

12:44.231 --> 12:46.533
it won't matter
what Agent Keen wants,

12:46.666 --> 12:48.701
only how long he can survive.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.003
We'll find him.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.671
<i>Call me back as soon</i>
as you know more.

12:52.672 --> 12:53.406
Ressler.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.214
Headlight trim
from the van.
It's a start.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.992
Mmm.
Look at you.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.663
So you're the one
they call Dembe.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.240
Quite a collection,
isn't it?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.111
Each one teaches me
something about pain.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.513
How to alleviate it

13:37.717 --> 13:38.751
or inflict it.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.097
When I was 12,
my mother went
to the hospital

13:50.230 --> 13:52.832
with a neural infection
that was misdiagnosed

13:52.966 --> 13:55.302
as a strained muscle.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.638
She was given ibuprofen
and sent home...

13:58.771 --> 14:03.543
...with an infection
that left her in
excruciating pain

14:03.676 --> 14:05.778
and bedridden for
the rest of her life.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.581
What caused
the misdiagnosis?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.285
The color
of her skin.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.324
The belief,
even by some doctors,

14:17.457 --> 14:19.359
that Blacks feel
less pain than whites.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.462
Thick skin,
biology, breeding,

14:23.430 --> 14:25.098
lies that lead to
Black patients

14:25.232 --> 14:27.467
receiving far fewer
pain meds than
white patients.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.370
But we know the truth,
don't we, Dembe?

14:31.972 --> 14:34.707
We know all about pain,
don't we?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.980
It's called
the Heretic's Fork.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.850
It was used during
the Spanish Inquisition
to extract confessions.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.352
Break the human spirit.

14:47.020 --> 14:51.491
Tell the truth,
or sooner or later,
you'll bleed to death.

14:53.060 --> 14:57.030
It's inscribed with
the Latin word <i>"abiuro,"</i>

14:57.164 --> 14:59.599
which means to swear
or take an oath.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.971
Will you do that
for me, Dembe?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.773
Swear to tell me
everything you know about
the Sikorsky Archive?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.108
<i>Walahi.</i>

15:10.277 --> 15:12.145
I swear I won't
tell you anything.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.387
Oh, I think you will.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.864
Tell me
you found something.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.701
We think we found
the van used in the abduction.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.304
It's missing a piece
of the headlight trim
that we found at the scene.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.771
<i>And what about Dembe?</i>

15:38.905 --> 15:39.973
Does the van
tell you anything

15:40.107 --> 15:41.408
about where they
may have taken Dembe?

15:41.541 --> 15:43.576
No, we're waiting
on the lab, but they
think it's unlikely.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.946
The vehicle was torched.
MPD's doing a search now.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.282
Lab services should have
a report within 24 hours,
maybe less.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.284
We don't have
that kind of time.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.385
Look, I'm telling you
what we know.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.921
Yeah. Thank you, Donald.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.811
Look, please,

16:21.548 --> 16:22.415
No.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.252
You betrayed us.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.554
You heard Dembe
talking about Ruddiger.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.489
No.
And you knew where
we were gonna be.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.424
No.
You set us up.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.798
I think you better
answer that.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.139
<i>Operator 627,</i>
Ward West.

16:46.273 --> 16:49.008
Ward West.
Briargate confirm.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.344
<i>We have a code red</i>
<i>alarm indicator.</i>
Do you have a breach?

16:51.478 --> 16:54.147
Yes, there's been
a breach, by me.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.183
Here's what
happens next.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.151
I'm gonna give you
a phone number.

16:58.285 --> 17:01.454
You're gonna pass it
up the food chain
to your boss.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.023
Tell Neville Townsend
it's Raymond Reddington.

17:04.157 --> 17:10.863
Tell him to call me
in 20 minutes
at 202-555-0184.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.166
It's a conversation
he won't want to miss.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.472
I'll get you a cane
to remember me by.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.377
My apologies, ladies.

17:34.454 --> 17:38.024
<i>Hello, Mr. Zuma.</i>
<i>I'm sorry we have to</i>
meet like this,

17:38.158 --> 17:40.493
<i>but I've found</i>
<i>this process</i>
to be both efficient

17:40.627 --> 17:43.230
<i>and effective</i>
for all involved.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.664
I'm going to
ask you
some questions.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.233
You're going to answer.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.934
<i>If you waver,</i>

17:48.067 --> 17:51.471
<i>Dr. Perillos will</i>
<i>help encourage</i>
your cooperation.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.474
<i>Let's begin with</i>
the Sikorsky Archive.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.808
<i>Does Reddington have it?</i>

17:59.546 --> 18:02.182
<i>Uh, Mr. Zuma,</i>
I need an answer.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.984
<i>No? Nothing?</i>

18:09.456 --> 18:13.226
The Irukandji jellyfish
is found off the coast
of Australia.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.528
Its sting is only
mildly irritating,

18:16.363 --> 18:17.897
but within half an hour,

18:18.030 --> 18:20.533
its venom inducesexcruciating muscle cramps,

18:21.234 --> 18:22.935
severe back pain,

18:23.069 --> 18:25.538
and a burning sensation
in the skin and face.

18:25.972 --> 18:26.939
Headaches.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.541
Sweating.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.277
Nausea.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.645
It's called
Irukandji Syndrome.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.449
The pain, combined with
an increase in heart rate

18:36.583 --> 18:40.052
and blood pressure,
causes a feeling
of impending doom.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.456
Chances are

18:43.590 --> 18:47.460
you just may want
to impale yourself
to ease the pain.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.497
<i>Uh, Mr. Zuma,</i>
<i>shall we discuss</i>
the Sikorsky Archive,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.232
<i>or do you need</i>
some encouragement?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.305
<i>Bad choice, Mr. Zuma.</i>

18:58.438 --> 19:00.773
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.942
<i>Doctor, I'll give</i>
<i>the two of you</i>
some time together.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.846
What is it?
It's Reddington.
He's made contact.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.294
Dembe Zuma.
I want him back.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.795
I'm sure you do.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.164
Keen tells me
he knows
all your secrets.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.099
<i>Elizabeth would</i>
never hurt Dembe.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.468
I want the archive.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.438
At what cost?
A war with me?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.340
Have you thought about
what that means?

19:33.473 --> 19:34.874
All I've thought
about recently

19:35.007 --> 19:37.710
is the fact that
you killed my family.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.247
I don't know
what Elizabeth
is telling you,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.649
but Katarina Rostova
killed your family,

19:43.416 --> 19:45.084
and I killed her.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.955
<i>That alone should be</i>
<i>enough for us to</i>
peacefully co-exist.

19:49.088 --> 19:52.325
A fact we can
discuss in person
once you accept my offer.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.261
Wha... What kind
of offer?

19:54.761 --> 19:55.628
For Dembe.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.163
Me for him.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.698
A trade.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.267
<i>Yes.</i>

20:00.400 --> 20:01.501
And then an uprising.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.536
Your people,

20:03.670 --> 20:05.538
rallying around
your sacrifice.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.907
I... I had no idea
you were
such a romantic.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.343
Oh, my goodness, yes.

20:10.477 --> 20:14.113
I have many
"thoughts that do often lie
too deep for tears."

20:15.515 --> 20:17.550
At the moment,
the main one being

20:17.684 --> 20:19.319
to put a bullet
in your forehead.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.589
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>
We do.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.357
I'll call you back
with the where and when.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.574
I wasn't making it up.
About the doctors.

20:41.708 --> 20:47.747
In 2016, 222 white doctors
at the University of Virginia

20:47.880 --> 20:50.216
were given
mock medical files

20:50.350 --> 20:53.586
of a white patient
and a Black patient

20:53.720 --> 20:58.157
and asked to
gauge their pain
on a scale of 1 to 10.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.393
They underestimated
the Black patient's pain
because...

21:01.961 --> 21:05.632
Now, these are doctors.
They said they thought

21:05.765 --> 21:10.069
Black people had less
sensitive nerve endings.

21:10.202 --> 21:14.106
Why is it
that white people
don't see our pain?

21:14.240 --> 21:16.075
I know Townsend
doesn't see mine.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.411
What about Reddington?

21:19.746 --> 21:20.713
Does he see yours?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.550
I know
who you are to him.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.586
What you do
for him.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.689
The secrets you keep,
like you're doing now,

21:29.822 --> 21:32.124
not telling me
about the archive.

21:32.258 --> 21:35.928
Does he know
what pain
that causes you?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.897
I don't mean this pain.
Anyone can see that.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.132
I mean inside.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.902
The pain
in your heart.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.438
Can he see that?

21:49.075 --> 21:50.076
<i>You can stop.</i>

21:50.209 --> 21:51.644
Excuse me?

21:51.778 --> 21:53.913
<i>We're making a trade.</i>
For whom?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.615
Who could know
the archive
more than Zuma?

21:56.148 --> 21:56.916
Raymond.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.592
He's not doing this
to save you.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.193
He's doing it
to save himself.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.996
He... he...

22:14.534 --> 22:16.002
He does feel my pain.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.471
Does he, now?

22:19.472 --> 22:21.073
Good.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.274
Then maybe
he'll feel this.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.692
Help you?
I'm here for a room.

22:39.826 --> 22:40.793
Neville said
he'd leave a key.

22:41.994 --> 22:42.829
Oh, Neville said?

22:43.496 --> 22:44.731
Neville said.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.166
Ah. Come around.
I'll buzz you in.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.704
What about
the dog?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.573
There's no dog.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.116
Is this kosher?

23:08.955 --> 23:09.822
<i>L'chaim.</i>

23:15.828 --> 23:17.630
Okay.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.632
There's a bench outside.
Have a seat.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.535
Concierge will be
with you shortly.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.692
I'm supposed to
let you go.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.529
But your resistance
is an inspiration.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.366
It makes me wonder,
are you really
that beholden to him?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.870
Would you hold out
until it's too late?

23:58.905 --> 23:59.872
I guess
we'll never know.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.891
Get back
in that chair!
I won't ask again!

24:31.137 --> 24:31.904
Antidote!

24:50.122 --> 24:51.924
Dembe.
Don't do it, Raymond.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.960
I'm coming.
Don't give yourself up.

25:33.332 --> 25:34.466
<i>Tell me</i>
<i>you got there</i>
in time.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.235
Tell me you found him.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.536
<i>No, we were</i>
too late.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.772
What did you find?
<i>We're securing</i>
the scene now,

25:39.906 --> 25:42.508
but it looks like her people
broke everything down
and cleared out.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.110
There's no sign
of Reddington.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.178
Look, this doctor,
is there anything
that you can tell me?

25:46.312 --> 25:48.180
Any specifics?
Any details that might help?

25:48.314 --> 25:50.516
<i>She had tools</i>
for torture,

25:50.650 --> 25:54.353
and she injected me
with a vial of poison
from jellyfish.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.688
<i>Jellyfish?</i>

25:55.822 --> 25:57.724
Irukandji jellyfish.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.358
That's what
she called them.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.893
I reached out to some
associates of ours

26:01.027 --> 26:02.261
to find out
who traffics them.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.063
All right, well...

26:04.196 --> 26:05.965
Look, my forensics
team's here.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.767
<i>You call me as soon</i>
<i>as you hear anything</i>
and I'll do the same.

26:30.890 --> 26:31.724
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

26:32.992 --> 26:34.193
<i>You kept your end</i>
of the deal,

26:34.326 --> 26:37.396
<i>and in a roundabout way,</i>
so did I.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.666
Dembe escaped.

26:39.799 --> 26:42.501
<i>Yes. As promised,</i>
he's free.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.071
And with him
went your leverage
to get me to talk.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.606
<i>Oh, I don't know</i>
about that.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.210
The Brazen Bull, I presume.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.115
Excellent. You're familiar
with Dr. Perillos.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.349
<i>Certainly.</i>

26:57.483 --> 27:00.920
<i>Legendarily</i>
draconian methods.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.222
Undeniably effective results.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.758
This is almost
a bucket-list moment
for me.

27:07.193 --> 27:10.462
Shall we begin?
Oh, let's not.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.799
Are you familiar
with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis?

27:12.932 --> 27:15.301
If I say yes,
can we skip
the demonstration?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.771
It's a viral infection
carried by mice

27:18.905 --> 27:21.473
that causes
ascending paralysis.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.442
<i>The virus attacks</i>
<i>the peripheral</i>
nervous system,

27:23.575 --> 27:27.246
<i>then works its way upwards</i>
<i>through the legs and torso</i>
to the chest,

27:27.379 --> 27:28.915
where it paralyzes
the lungs,

27:30.783 --> 27:32.651
causing the victim
to suffocate.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.353
Careful.
I'm terribly ticklish.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.024
See?

27:38.157 --> 27:40.693
<i>There is an antidote,</i>
which I will supply

27:40.827 --> 27:42.494
<i>after you've told me</i>
about the archive.

27:42.628 --> 27:45.264
<i>Uh, think about it.</i>

27:45.397 --> 27:46.132
<i>But not too long.</i>

27:47.366 --> 27:48.968
<i>You haven't got</i>
much time left.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.841
What did you
find out?

27:54.974 --> 27:56.508
I haven't heard back
from our people yet.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.344
Well, it turns out
Irukandji jellyfish

27:58.477 --> 28:01.247
are sourced
only by a few
select brokers.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.482
Brokers?
Who sell animals
to research labs,

28:03.615 --> 28:05.317
universities,
veterinary schools,

28:05.451 --> 28:07.286
and companies
to provide animal
testing services.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.455
Disgusting, I know,
and it gets worse.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.690
There are two types
of these dealers.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.493
Class A,
which breed specifically
for research purposes,

28:14.626 --> 28:18.630
and Class B, who source
animals from random locations
like auctions, pounds,

28:18.765 --> 28:20.299
or even
newspaper ads.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.134
Okay, that is
disgusting.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.236
Right? I feel like there's
a separate Blacklist case
in here somewhere.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.838
The point being?

28:25.972 --> 28:27.940
The point being
I could only find
three Class B vendors

28:28.074 --> 28:30.276
who even supply
our species
of jellyfish.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.711
Two haven't made a sale
in well over six months.

28:32.845 --> 28:33.880
And the third?

28:34.013 --> 28:36.048
The third
is Tolofson-Hammond.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.250
London based.
License revoked.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.451
They have
a court case pending,

28:39.585 --> 28:42.188
and one of their clients
who failed to appear...

28:44.256 --> 28:45.224
That's her.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.525
Name's
Kayla Lynne Banks.

28:46.658 --> 28:47.960
Last known address
in Cardiff.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.661
Both of which
are fakes.

28:49.796 --> 28:53.065
Okay,
let's work backwards.
Unwind her alias.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.935
Find out where
she got her passports,
her bank accounts.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.736
How she built
this false identity

28:57.870 --> 28:59.238
may point us
to where she is now.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.079
Nothing?

29:08.480 --> 29:09.215
No pain at all.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.918
Good.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.553
And here I thought
you fetishized pain.

29:14.686 --> 29:17.523
No more than
an oncologist
fetishizes cancer.

29:17.656 --> 29:20.692
I study it in the hopes
of finding a cure for it.

29:20.827 --> 29:21.894
I don't believe you.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.097
I think you enjoy
the means too much

29:25.231 --> 29:26.198
to really care
about the end.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.502
I'm not talking
about a medicine.

29:30.636 --> 29:31.603
I'm talking about
a solution.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.374
An alteration
in our DNA.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.543
Did you know
the mole rat
can't feel burning pain

29:37.676 --> 29:40.746
because it lacks
the chemical Substance P?

29:40.880 --> 29:43.215
You want people
to be like mole rats?

29:43.349 --> 29:44.817
I want us to be
impervious to pain.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.854
What a terrible idea.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.793
Spoken like someone
who's never had
his pain ignored,

29:54.927 --> 29:57.930
who's never
begged for relief
and not gotten it.

29:58.064 --> 30:00.166
I'd prefer to have
my pain ignored

30:00.299 --> 30:02.268
than to have
no pain at all.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.871
Without pain,
there can be
no real pleasure.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.408
Without the lows,
you have no way
to measure the highs.

30:10.910 --> 30:15.647
If any part of your
sadism-in-the-name-of-science

30:15.781 --> 30:19.485
is designed to improve
the human condition,

30:20.887 --> 30:22.421
making us unfeeling

30:22.554 --> 30:24.490
is absolutely
the wrong way
of going about it.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.427
Case in point.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.698
This is gonna make
killing you infinitely
more pleasurable.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.669
We're ready.

30:37.803 --> 30:38.905
<i>How much time</i>
has he got?

30:39.571 --> 30:41.273
An hour.
Maybe less.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.977
<i>So, the archive.</i>

30:45.111 --> 30:48.414
<i>Like the minister says</i>
<i>at every wedding,</i>
"Speak now,

30:48.547 --> 30:50.282
<i>"or forever hold</i>
your peace."

31:01.193 --> 31:02.828
Is there anything
on the APB?

31:02.962 --> 31:04.830
Not yet.
And on your end?

31:04.964 --> 31:07.033
I've called everyone,
but everything
is taking too long.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.301
There must be something
they missed at the scene.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.637
We've reviewed all
the crime-scene analysis
from where you were held,

31:11.770 --> 31:13.639
plus what we found,
or didn't find,
at the van.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.207
Then we should
go through it again.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.482
You take the forensics
from the van.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.317
I'll review
the findings
from the lab.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.322
Don't take this
the wrong way,

31:31.290 --> 31:32.224
but you'd make
a good cop.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.659
You know what I do
for a living.

31:33.792 --> 31:34.760
I do.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.495
I also know
who you are.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.165
A Black Muslim.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.968
That describes
quite a few cops.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.703
We will find Raymond.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.572
I hope you're right.
But he lives
on the edge.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.341
And one day,
he may go over it.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.247
The report says
the van was burned
using an accelerant.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.450
That's right.
Uh, cyclohexane.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.053
Which burns
at a low flash point.

32:01.187 --> 32:02.521
That's why there were
no forensics.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.290
And what
does that tell you?

32:04.423 --> 32:07.359
That the absence
of evidence
is evidence.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.278
<i>It's not everything</i>
<i>you thought</i>
it would be, is it?

32:27.479 --> 32:28.747
<i>This moment?</i>

32:30.782 --> 32:32.051
<i>You've waited for it,</i>

32:34.253 --> 32:35.554
anticipated it.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.426
But somehow,

32:43.062 --> 32:45.031
it's dissatisfying.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.399
It actually
exceeds expectation.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.102
<i>I wasn't talking</i>
to you.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.106
We know who my assassin
really is.

32:55.874 --> 32:57.043
Don't we, Elizabeth?

32:58.877 --> 33:04.316
It saddens me to bear witness
to this moment in your life.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.418
This

33:07.753 --> 33:10.422
crossing of Rubicon

33:11.890 --> 33:14.826
from which
you can never
get back.

33:17.729 --> 33:22.534
I know, in this moment,
it may appear self-serving

33:22.668 --> 33:25.737
to suggest that you instruct

33:27.273 --> 33:28.940
<i>the good doctor</i>

33:29.075 --> 33:31.310
<i>to administer the antidote,</i>

33:33.145 --> 33:36.014
but I strongly suggest
that you do just that,

33:39.085 --> 33:40.086
because

33:41.087 --> 33:42.054
I have

33:43.089 --> 33:45.457
seen the other side
of that river,

33:48.327 --> 33:52.364
and it's a place
I never,

33:53.865 --> 33:55.534
never wanted you to go.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.041
Who is it?

34:14.986 --> 34:15.987
I said...

34:17.323 --> 34:18.590
Dembe, wait!
Hold on!

34:18.724 --> 34:19.691
Cyclohexane!

34:20.359 --> 34:22.194
Your accelerant.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.763
You used it
to help them torch
the van they put me in.

34:24.896 --> 34:25.864
Wait. Stop.

34:25.997 --> 34:26.998
You set us up!

34:27.566 --> 34:28.700
They tortured me!

34:30.136 --> 34:32.338
My hand!
They made me
to do it!

34:32.471 --> 34:34.473
Where is he?
They weren't supposed
to take you!

34:34.606 --> 34:35.674
They were looking
for Reddington!

34:35.807 --> 34:37.876
Well, now
they have him.
Yeah.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.911
Ruddiger, look at me!

34:41.613 --> 34:43.515
I'm gonna make
what that woman
did to your hand

34:43.649 --> 34:45.050
feel like a manicure

34:45.184 --> 34:47.419
unless you tell me
where they are
holding Raymond.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.889
Ruddiger.
The warehouse!

34:51.022 --> 34:53.959
East of the airport.
Braxton and 9th.

34:58.029 --> 34:58.764
The radiator.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.699
Tie yourself to it.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.401
Dembe, please.
Now!

35:13.044 --> 35:14.012
He's not coming back.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.186
He's not coming back!

35:22.954 --> 35:26.558
What you're experiencing
is unilateral paralysis.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.395
Your diaphragm is
partially functioning

35:29.528 --> 35:31.830
as the paralysis
moves higher into
the chest cavity.

35:33.265 --> 35:36.335
Soon, your diaphragm
will be completely paralyzed

35:36.468 --> 35:37.936
and you'll need a machine
to assist in breathing.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.607
Unfortunately for you,
we have no machine.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.776
But I do have this.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.813
<i>The doctor's antidote</i>
takes immediate effect.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.748
<i>You'll be breathing</i>
normally within seconds.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.351
All you need to do first

35:52.484 --> 35:55.587
is tell me
what you know
about the archive.

35:59.425 --> 36:00.592
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
say that again?

36:00.726 --> 36:02.494
8353 Braxton.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.862
I'm writing it down.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.864
But before I sent units,
I'd like to get inside.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.366
There's no time.
I'll explain later.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.600
Just send units.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.168
Dembe, talk to me.

36:10.869 --> 36:11.603
Dembe.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.448
Step away.

36:35.927 --> 36:36.895
<i>It's okay,</i>
Raymond.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.332
What have you done
to him?

36:40.466 --> 36:42.434
<i>Aren't you</i>
the loving couple.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.670
<i>First he comes</i>
to save you,

36:44.803 --> 36:46.705
and now you,
you come to save him.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.340
Or try to.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.309
I'm afraid
you're too late.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.943
Is there an antidote?

36:52.077 --> 36:53.845
<i>The answer is no,</i>

36:57.883 --> 36:58.884
I won't ask twice.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.554
Give it to him.

37:13.699 --> 37:14.666
What's wrong
with him?

37:16.167 --> 37:17.736
I paralyzed
his diaphragm.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.540
You came here
to save him.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.175
He came here
to save himself.

37:25.176 --> 37:26.778
You look at the cause.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.180
I only see the effect.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.450
I'm standing here
while he can
barely breathe.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.753
Would Townsend
do that for you?

37:36.822 --> 37:37.689
Would anyone?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.896
I want to know exactly
what you did to him.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.911
Tell us about Townsend.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.482
Where he is,

38:05.050 --> 38:06.051
how you contact him...

38:22.934 --> 38:24.436
I don't want you
to suffocate.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.240
I have the antidote,
and I will give it to you.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.979
But not until
you tell us
what we need to know.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.104
Hey, call the EMTs

38:59.237 --> 39:00.772
and search the building
for Reddington and Dembe.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.277
Donald Ressler, FBI.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.846
I'm gonna get you
medically cleared,

39:07.979 --> 39:10.115
and then whatever
you told Reddington
about Townsend,

39:10.248 --> 39:11.650
well, you're gonna tell me.

39:24.062 --> 39:24.796
Sir?

39:25.797 --> 39:26.865
I'm sorry
to wake you, sir.

39:28.667 --> 39:29.435
They're ready
for you.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.188
Do you believe her?

39:51.690 --> 39:53.459
That Townsend
paid her in cash

39:53.592 --> 39:54.893
and always used
a burner phone?

39:56.261 --> 39:57.529
I... I suppose.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.231
I heard from Park.

40:00.365 --> 40:03.034
The video link
to Townsend
was encrypted.

40:03.168 --> 40:07.673
They're going to
try and trace it,
but they're not optimistic.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.842
All of this
and going after Perillos
got us nothing.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.246
I think we both know
that's not true.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.683
We came for each other.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.723
Do you think
that I see your pain?

40:31.062 --> 40:31.863
Do you?

40:32.864 --> 40:33.865
No.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.736
I don't. Not always.

40:54.019 --> 40:54.886
How's the patient?

40:55.554 --> 40:56.688
He'll be okay.

40:56.822 --> 40:57.889
Thanks to you.

40:58.590 --> 40:59.691
Good detective work.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.093
I told you
we'd find him.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.128
You were right.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.063
But so was I.

41:06.532 --> 41:09.267
He lives at the edge,
and one day,
he will go over it.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.171
You need to be prepared
for when that happens.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.377
By the way, we went
to Ruddiger's apartment.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.478
He wasn't there.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.315
I got nothing.
You?

41:27.452 --> 41:28.787
I left him tied.

41:29.420 --> 41:30.822
Well, he wasn't there.

41:32.591 --> 41:33.324
Neville,
that's enough.

41:35.761 --> 41:36.628
That's enough,
Neville!

41:56.982 --> 41:57.949
I want you to know

41:59.417 --> 42:01.419
you're only alive
because of Keen.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.955
You understand that,
Ruddiger?

42:04.089 --> 42:06.725
She begged me
to spare your life.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.661
A life which I now own.

42:09.795 --> 42:10.962
Welcome to the family.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.398
Don't fail me again!
