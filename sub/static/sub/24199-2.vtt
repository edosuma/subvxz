WEBVTT

00:00.447 --> 00:02.393
<i>Previously, on "The Americans."</i>

00:02.487 --> 00:03.675
Did your professor talk

00:03.700 --> 00:05.112
about the Summit again this week?

00:05.189 --> 00:07.323
He thinks the Summit's
going to be a big success.

00:07.425 --> 00:09.005
It's hard to trust the Americans.

00:09.078 --> 00:13.329
So, I'm thinking of... leaving my job.

00:13.431 --> 00:14.497
Not the FBI.

00:14.522 --> 00:16.088
The department I'm working in.

00:16.621 --> 00:19.502
We're talking to someone,
and it is risky.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.969
Gennadi Bystrov.

00:21.172 --> 00:22.738
- Nice to meet you.
- Stan.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.306
I am a courier, so...

00:24.408 --> 00:26.908
maybe we can work together.

00:27.011 --> 00:28.510
The couriers work in pairs.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.178
One stays outside the stall,

00:30.280 --> 00:31.743
while the other one takes the pouch

00:31.768 --> 00:33.572
inside the stall with him.

00:33.824 --> 00:34.896
That's the weak point.

00:34.957 --> 00:39.471
_

00:39.523 --> 00:42.050
_

00:42.313 --> 00:45.753
_

00:45.788 --> 00:47.455
_

00:47.738 --> 00:51.578
_

00:51.661 --> 00:54.275
_

00:54.471 --> 00:56.704
We want you to find out
what your wife is doing

00:56.729 --> 00:57.729
and tell us.

00:57.787 --> 00:59.386
And if you have to...

00:59.575 --> 01:01.039
Stop her.

01:01.156 --> 01:02.790
This summit is a big deal.

01:03.232 --> 01:04.468
There's a lot to do.

01:04.568 --> 01:06.099
I know how tired you are,

01:06.124 --> 01:07.140
but I need to talk to you.

01:07.165 --> 01:08.899
If you knew how tired I am,

01:08.924 --> 01:10.184
you wouldn't still be talking.

01:10.209 --> 01:12.610
I need sleep. Let me sleep.

01:40.415 --> 01:42.348
Even if we get there,
what's it give us?

01:42.737 --> 01:44.227
Well, we got his sworn testimony

01:44.252 --> 01:45.785
that he never bought cocaine from her.

01:45.846 --> 01:47.212
Yeah, a single count of perjury.

01:47.301 --> 01:49.098
That's if we can make it stick
with the jury.

01:49.123 --> 01:50.238
Which I doubt.

01:50.263 --> 01:51.657
I can't get over those goddamn shoes.

01:51.682 --> 01:53.815
- Alligator.
- Waltzing around City Hall in those

01:53.840 --> 01:55.223
while the city goes to shit.

01:55.276 --> 01:56.596
Hey, didn't we subpoena them?

01:56.643 --> 01:57.675
- The shoes?
- Yeah.

01:57.791 --> 01:59.656
Yeah, we got 'em.

01:59.849 --> 02:02.101
Agent Beeman, line three.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.741
Beeman.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.410
Yeah, I'll come down this afternoon.

02:16.050 --> 02:17.883
I'll come down now.

02:47.492 --> 02:48.825
Quiet around here.

02:49.082 --> 02:50.181
Mm-hmm.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.219
Where is everybody?

02:56.322 --> 02:57.588
There's a big summit coming up.

02:57.690 --> 02:58.808
Lot of Russians in town.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.147
Everybody's out.

03:09.234 --> 03:10.967
Teacup called the ops line.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.436
Didn't sound good.

03:14.256 --> 03:15.471
What's wrong?

03:15.573 --> 03:16.807
I don't know.

03:16.909 --> 03:19.801
But I told him you will see him
at six tonight.

03:20.045 --> 03:21.778
Oh, great.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.514
You calling Renee to tell her
I'm coming home late?

03:25.984 --> 03:27.450
So...

03:30.347 --> 03:31.880
guess who's in town?

03:33.991 --> 03:35.124
Oleg Burov.

03:36.459 --> 03:37.892
You're shitting me.

03:38.496 --> 03:39.886
Nope.

03:47.111 --> 03:48.651
At his old job?

03:48.786 --> 03:50.619
At the Potomac Inn.

03:50.808 --> 03:52.708
Not on a dip passport.

03:53.064 --> 03:54.211
We're on him?

03:54.301 --> 03:55.834
Intermittent.

03:56.013 --> 03:58.466
We're stretched thin right now,
with the Summit.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.917
CIA says he's been out of the KGB

04:00.942 --> 04:02.537
for three years.

04:04.888 --> 04:06.129
They believe that?

04:06.196 --> 04:08.462
That's what their sources
in Moscow say.

04:08.893 --> 04:10.474
He's here on a tourist visa,

04:10.551 --> 04:11.804
put down on his application

04:11.829 --> 04:13.653
that he's going to some kind of class

04:13.678 --> 04:15.345
at George Mason.

04:15.857 --> 04:17.398
That check out?

04:17.500 --> 04:21.569
He's enrolled in a course
on urban transport planning.

04:22.007 --> 04:25.373
For his father's ministry, maybe...

04:26.354 --> 04:28.598
Urban transport planning.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.201
That's a long way from the KGB.

04:35.807 --> 04:37.485
Yeah.

04:39.457 --> 04:42.141
If you happen to stop by and see him,

04:42.984 --> 04:44.602
just let me know what you think.

06:09.590 --> 06:10.889
Meagan?

06:11.357 --> 06:12.636
Patrick!

06:12.682 --> 06:14.291
It's so good to see you.

06:14.316 --> 06:15.594
How're things over at State?

06:15.696 --> 06:16.728
Oh, same as always.

06:16.830 --> 06:17.870
Busy, with the Summit, though.

06:17.932 --> 06:19.031
You're telling me.

06:19.344 --> 06:20.631
Exciting times, though.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.133
Yeah, if we don't all kill each other.

06:23.437 --> 06:25.470
I've heard things
are a little hot over there.

06:25.957 --> 06:27.638
More than a little.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.174
How much...

06:31.010 --> 06:32.777
How much of the rank and file

06:32.802 --> 06:34.768
is with Shultz on this?

06:34.948 --> 06:36.538
Well, of the people I talk to...

06:36.563 --> 06:38.315
- Mm-hmm.
- ...half, maybe.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.818
My boss, yes. His boss, no.

06:41.046 --> 06:42.378
The problem is,

06:42.482 --> 06:45.089
he thinks Gorbachev
is the second coming.

06:45.341 --> 06:47.548
You can't go into a
negotiation like that.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.603
That's right.

06:48.628 --> 06:50.828
ACDA wants to make a deal.
That's what they're there for.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.883
But a few of us

06:52.908 --> 06:54.608
are waking up every morning
and wondering

06:54.633 --> 06:56.433
what we have to do
to get out of this thing.

06:56.535 --> 06:59.912
Meanwhile, Herrington's
already invited Gorbachev

06:59.937 --> 07:02.206
to Lake Bistineau
for the log cabin treatment.

07:02.386 --> 07:04.452
If you'd told me a year ago

07:04.477 --> 07:06.843
we'd be about to sign this treaty...

07:07.086 --> 07:08.712
Look, realistically,

07:08.939 --> 07:10.480
I don't know what we have to do

07:10.505 --> 07:13.429
to roll back INF on this.

07:13.842 --> 07:15.125
But by the time the Russians

07:15.150 --> 07:16.452
head back home from this summit,

07:16.477 --> 07:18.043
START'll be a done deal too.

07:18.119 --> 07:19.786
And if that happens...

07:22.197 --> 07:23.496
It's no secret

07:23.598 --> 07:26.131
that the Russians want to deal...

07:26.172 --> 07:27.460
They can't afford an arms race.

07:27.502 --> 07:30.488
So, we're holding most of the cards.

07:31.906 --> 07:35.100
You think Reagan's just going soft?

07:35.810 --> 07:37.142
I don't know.

07:37.431 --> 07:38.643
Maybe.

07:38.723 --> 07:40.872
Could be worried about his legacy.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.316
It's so frustrating,

07:42.349 --> 07:44.082
because this summit could wind up

07:44.185 --> 07:46.418
winning us the entire Cold War.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.686
Mm.

07:47.799 --> 07:49.098
But Weinberger and Gaffney...

07:49.123 --> 07:51.303
They've got to keep Reagan
true to himself.

07:51.525 --> 07:55.160
Listen, I'm gonna be over
at State on Wednesday,

07:55.185 --> 07:56.725
are you free for lunch?

07:56.797 --> 07:57.863
Yeah. Sure.

07:57.939 --> 07:59.219
You know that steak place on Virginia?

07:59.265 --> 08:00.865
I-I've got all-day meetings.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.277
Let's just go to the cafeteria.

08:02.302 --> 08:03.480
Ugh. The food's so bad there...

08:03.523 --> 08:04.789
Come on.

08:05.289 --> 08:08.119
I won't have time to do anything
out of the building.

08:08.508 --> 08:11.067
Okay. 12:30. Cafeteria.

08:11.205 --> 08:12.671
- I'll see you then.
- Yep.

08:37.169 --> 08:39.135
She kick me out of house!

08:39.238 --> 08:41.062
She scream, she... she yell...

08:41.155 --> 08:42.615
I-I don't know what to do.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.362
I'm just... walking around streets.

08:45.784 --> 08:47.712
Okay. Well, what happened?
What'd you do?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.711
I didn't do nothing... I-I

08:51.051 --> 08:53.937
watch games, relax,

08:54.023 --> 08:56.756
I ask her to please
bring me another beer,

08:56.781 --> 08:58.847
she was already standing.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.864
And she just...

09:00.932 --> 09:02.564
oh God,

09:02.645 --> 09:03.860
on and on,

09:04.048 --> 09:07.015
every little thing I ever do is wrong.

09:09.059 --> 09:10.258
Sorry I called you.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.325
But you are the only person I can call.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.487
No, that's okay,

09:15.407 --> 09:17.037
but you gotta just...

09:19.411 --> 09:20.840
there's a lot at stake here.

09:20.884 --> 09:21.950
Right?

09:22.126 --> 09:23.492
Not just you and Sofia,

09:23.714 --> 09:27.025
but Ilia, your work with us.

09:27.084 --> 09:28.217
Yes.

09:28.331 --> 09:30.098
Yes. I know.

09:30.167 --> 09:31.800
I told her that.

09:32.162 --> 09:34.363
It's gonna be fine, okay?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.905
I really gotta go.

09:38.555 --> 09:40.120
Stan.

09:45.302 --> 09:46.601
You're a good friend.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.703
Yeah.

09:52.201 --> 09:54.767
I'll see ya, Gennadi.

10:03.146 --> 10:04.602
I need it. I need it.

10:04.627 --> 10:06.089
It's not time yet. I need it.

10:06.483 --> 10:08.416
Screw you, it's not time.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.458
It's killing me.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.943
Give me my goddamn morphine.

10:11.988 --> 10:13.755
Deep breaths... in and out...
in and out...

10:13.836 --> 10:15.236
What's wrong with you?

10:15.713 --> 10:17.003
Can't you see that I am in pain!

10:17.066 --> 10:18.301
Glenn!

10:18.381 --> 10:19.807
I can't give it to her
for another hour.

10:19.832 --> 10:21.132
She'll develop a tolerance...

10:22.738 --> 10:24.805
Okay. Okay.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.300
I can't... I can't do this...

10:26.349 --> 10:28.256
I ca... I ca...

10:28.310 --> 10:30.164
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

10:30.299 --> 10:31.455
Okay?

10:31.544 --> 10:32.872
There you go.

10:32.921 --> 10:34.752
- Shh.
- I can't...

10:34.850 --> 10:36.283
I can't... I can't... Okay, okay. Shh.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.079
I can't go on like this. I ca...

10:38.106 --> 10:40.039
I don't want to. I don't want to.

10:42.343 --> 10:43.343
You need to do it.

10:43.371 --> 10:44.837
You need to do it.

10:45.193 --> 10:47.319
We need to end this...
end this. I ca...

10:48.590 --> 10:50.249
We will. We will. We will.

10:50.371 --> 10:52.371
Soon. Shh shh shh. Shh shh shh shh.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.400
<i>75 RBIs.</i>

10:54.503 --> 10:57.971
<i>Good production considering
the low batting average.</i>

10:58.775 --> 11:01.440
<i>And the 1-0 pitch to changeup
bounced in the dirt.</i>

11:01.542 --> 11:04.093
<i>And it's 2 and 0.</i>

11:05.827 --> 11:07.803
<i>Davis batting just 249,</i>

11:07.848 --> 11:11.450
<i>but you get a guy who can
hit the ball a long way</i>

11:11.631 --> 11:15.954
<i>if you just groove one here
so he's gonna wanna be careful.</i>

11:17.224 --> 11:18.634
<i>Braves lead 4-3</i>

11:18.673 --> 11:22.675
<i>after Murphy's monster homer
in the top of 6th.</i>

11:22.930 --> 11:24.730
<i>Now the 2-0 count.</i>

11:24.832 --> 11:26.197
<i>Gary winds and delivers.</i>

11:26.299 --> 11:28.171
<i>Davis swings and belts one...</i>

11:28.241 --> 11:29.508
Glenn?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.419
Hold on one sec.

11:31.606 --> 11:35.378
<i>...and see the ball
sail way back into the seats.</i>

11:35.494 --> 11:37.194
<i>Home run for Chili Davis,</i>

11:37.450 --> 11:38.883
<i>and the Giants have tied the game.</i>

11:39.012 --> 11:40.576
Sorry.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.040
It was a big play.

11:43.690 --> 11:46.002
Do you want to talk later? Or...

11:51.591 --> 11:53.091
No. No no...

11:56.522 --> 11:58.254
...sorry.

12:02.409 --> 12:03.825
So.

12:04.670 --> 12:06.569
What you said up there...

12:08.727 --> 12:11.552
Are you two planning
on ending her life?

12:17.483 --> 12:19.267
I know how hard this is.

12:28.326 --> 12:31.935
She's suffering.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.406
She can't go on like this.

12:38.070 --> 12:39.702
She doesn't want to.

12:44.696 --> 12:46.562
I know people who have done it.

12:52.817 --> 12:54.970
What are you planning to use?

12:56.654 --> 12:58.740
We don't need to talk about this.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.542
It can go wrong,

13:01.926 --> 13:05.460
if you don't do it the right way,

13:05.535 --> 13:06.940
that can be... worse.

13:11.869 --> 13:16.026
I've been keeping
a little bit of morphine

13:16.786 --> 13:18.863
each time we throw away a bottle.

13:21.002 --> 13:23.168
I figure by early next month...

13:23.619 --> 13:25.185
That's not good.

13:26.519 --> 13:28.689
It could just put her into a coma.

13:29.445 --> 13:31.278
Or leave her braindead.

13:39.428 --> 13:41.495
I could help you.

13:47.102 --> 13:49.102
I could never ask you to do that.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.475
You didn't ask.

14:05.180 --> 14:07.850
I supposed she would've
just drifted off.

14:11.804 --> 14:14.126
It's not usually that easy.

14:14.368 --> 14:16.535
Well, she's really gonna suffer now.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.478
You just have to keep her alive
through the summit.

14:24.272 --> 14:25.938
What does she draw?

14:27.309 --> 14:28.874
People. Faces.

14:28.899 --> 14:30.533
Kind of... strange...

14:30.578 --> 14:32.111
I don't know.

14:32.513 --> 14:34.514
You don't like her work?

14:35.148 --> 14:37.843
I don't know why people
spend their life doing that.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.985
At least her husband
is doing something.

14:43.384 --> 14:46.212
I'm having lunch with MCCLEESH
Wednesday.

14:46.994 --> 14:49.195
The only place he'd do it

14:49.473 --> 14:51.730
is the State Department cafeteria.

14:57.838 --> 15:00.298
He's working on the negotiation.

15:00.628 --> 15:03.094
And he loves to impress me.

15:05.578 --> 15:08.378
The State Department cafeteria?

15:11.485 --> 15:14.685
I keep asking myself what the odds are.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.214
Well, don't do that.

15:26.419 --> 15:28.109
The Centre wants you to contact

15:28.134 --> 15:31.001
your old friend Lyle Rennhull.

15:31.427 --> 15:32.900
A general now.

15:33.039 --> 15:35.274
You're to try and get
something called a...

15:35.299 --> 15:38.432
lithium-based radiation
sensor from him.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.974
Apparently the Air Force
has three hundred.

15:42.601 --> 15:44.447
I'm supposed to give you the order,

15:44.549 --> 15:47.715
tell you it's from the person
you met with in Mexico, and...

15:47.848 --> 15:50.841
say we need it for the
thing he was working on.

15:51.556 --> 15:55.192
And I'm not supposed
to ask any questions.

15:58.061 --> 16:02.598
A lithium-based radiation sensor.

16:07.372 --> 16:09.264
Well, that's a new one.

16:20.925 --> 16:23.338
The way Paige has taken to you...

16:24.956 --> 16:26.722
If something were to happen to me,

16:26.747 --> 16:28.213
at any point...

16:28.392 --> 16:31.026
I think you could finish with her.

16:40.438 --> 16:43.038
She'll have it better.

16:45.376 --> 16:49.264
State. Or even if it's the CIA.

16:49.289 --> 16:51.428
She will go to work in the morning.

16:51.453 --> 16:53.186
And she'll come home at night.

16:54.233 --> 16:56.251
You'll be fine, Elizabeth.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.933
Both of you will.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.256
Yeah, hold on, hold on.

17:05.309 --> 17:06.575
Stan, he is never at home.

17:06.596 --> 17:08.840
And when he is, he drinks, he watch TV,

17:08.866 --> 17:10.031
he pass out on sofa.

17:10.056 --> 17:11.521
I can't stand it, you know.

17:13.429 --> 17:16.499
And I know he has sex with other women.

17:16.873 --> 17:18.806
Stan, I know it.

17:19.682 --> 17:21.340
I want a divorce, Stan.

17:22.564 --> 17:25.713
Okay, well the thing is...

17:25.773 --> 17:27.406
No. It's done.

17:27.727 --> 17:28.783
It's done.

17:28.885 --> 17:31.919
My friend Bogdan,
he tells me to finish it.

17:32.423 --> 17:33.587
Bogdan...?

17:34.232 --> 17:35.956
At TASS. I told you about him.

17:36.058 --> 17:37.824
No. You didn't.

17:44.199 --> 17:45.865
Bogdan.

17:45.968 --> 17:48.501
He is a very kind man.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.310
Friend.

17:50.771 --> 17:54.601
Um, very intelligent
and nice to talk to.

17:54.815 --> 17:57.385
He is a senior correspondent.

17:58.780 --> 18:01.161
You and Bogdan... are you...

18:01.186 --> 18:03.085
No!

18:03.164 --> 18:04.809
But you... you like him.

18:05.433 --> 18:06.966
He gives advice,

18:07.155 --> 18:12.247
and eh... he is good at listening.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.144
You know, Gennadi, he never listen.

18:15.543 --> 18:17.850
Sofia, if you leave...

18:18.833 --> 18:21.616
Gennadi is doing dangerous work,

18:21.641 --> 18:23.041
and you're a big part of it.

18:25.996 --> 18:28.073
You're still very important
to each other.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.866
You will figure it out, okay?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.596
I have to take care of my boy.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.539
You got home pretty late last night.

19:24.475 --> 19:26.592
I tried not to wake you and...

19:26.737 --> 19:28.704
It's fine.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.983
I'm sorry if I've been...

19:36.775 --> 19:38.576
Just so busy.

19:43.687 --> 19:46.122
You want to tell me about some of it?

19:52.157 --> 19:55.375
I think Paige is pretty good at this.

19:56.194 --> 19:59.056
But... she made a mistake
the other night.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.426
Got someone's name wrong.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.949
It happens.

20:05.022 --> 20:06.288
Happened to us.

20:06.909 --> 20:09.538
You grow into it.

20:09.639 --> 20:11.606
I learned fast.

20:18.982 --> 20:21.783
Don't tell her we talked about this.

20:37.052 --> 20:38.608
Right.

20:40.837 --> 20:42.336
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:42.438 --> 20:43.971
Can you come down to the vault
for a minute?

20:44.310 --> 20:45.645
I'm meeting Lawton in two minutes.

20:45.741 --> 20:47.007
I can come down in a couple hours.

20:47.043 --> 20:48.308
Just quickly...

20:55.451 --> 20:56.883
- You saw them?
- Yeah.

20:56.986 --> 20:59.385
Things aren't good between them. Again.

20:59.643 --> 21:00.988
Worse this time.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.910
Can it be fixed?

21:03.503 --> 21:05.700
I'm not a marriage counselor, Dennis.

21:05.947 --> 21:07.193
He wants to keep it together,

21:07.218 --> 21:09.586
her I'm not so sure about.

21:09.979 --> 21:11.531
She met a guy at work.

21:12.919 --> 21:14.540
- Uh oh.
- Yeah.

21:14.659 --> 21:16.192
I'm worried about it.

21:16.284 --> 21:18.528
He's supposed to fly tomorrow.

21:19.616 --> 21:22.041
Nobody's life was on the line
when I left my wife.

21:22.144 --> 21:23.976
Yeah, same when Sandra left me.

21:24.571 --> 21:26.805
Woulda slowed her down, right?

21:28.816 --> 21:30.347
I'm not sure.

21:31.225 --> 21:32.624
Her being who she is,

21:32.790 --> 21:34.347
her new friend
could find out everything

21:34.372 --> 21:36.205
at lunch one day.

21:36.470 --> 21:37.695
She's tricky,

21:37.751 --> 21:39.951
but she's not looking
to get him killed.

21:44.165 --> 21:45.382
He goes.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.078
We work on her.

21:47.368 --> 21:49.434
We sleep like shit, as always.

21:49.537 --> 21:51.170
I can't tell you how much better I feel

21:51.272 --> 21:53.438
just dealing with murderers,
drug dealers,

21:53.463 --> 21:55.259
and corrupt politicians.

21:55.485 --> 21:56.534
I'm serious.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.650
- Stan, we got Lawton.
- Yeah.

21:58.991 --> 22:00.558
Talk to you.

22:23.314 --> 22:26.054
The future looks
bright, don't you think?

22:27.386 --> 22:28.934
Excuse me?

22:29.242 --> 22:31.538
You met with one of
my colleagues in 1981.

22:31.563 --> 22:35.232
You wanted to warn us against
an arms race in space.

22:36.969 --> 22:38.680
This is not a good idea.

22:38.738 --> 22:39.973
It's okay, General.

22:40.143 --> 22:42.248
- We can talk for a minute or two.
- I'm not interested.

22:42.306 --> 22:44.040
I understand. I really do.

22:44.195 --> 22:45.427
But I actually need your help.

22:45.452 --> 22:47.557
- I can't help you.
- It's pretty simple.

22:47.582 --> 22:49.472
I need a piece of technology.

22:50.082 --> 22:51.530
We understand that the Air Force

22:51.555 --> 22:54.490
has acquired lithium-based
radiation sensors.

22:55.620 --> 22:56.953
You're crazy.

22:57.202 --> 22:59.603
The Air Force
has three hundred of them.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.004
You know that any imbalance
is dangerous.

23:02.107 --> 23:03.306
We just need one.

23:03.408 --> 23:04.859
Do you even know what that is?

23:04.926 --> 23:07.773
A sensor that detects
a nuclear blast very quickly,

23:07.798 --> 23:09.178
and can be mass produced.

23:09.214 --> 23:10.780
There are channels

23:10.875 --> 23:12.975
for communications
between our countries.

23:13.151 --> 23:15.351
- I'm not one of them.
- You have been.

23:15.453 --> 23:17.353
And this is something
that has to happen

23:17.378 --> 23:18.711
quickly and quietly.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.748
Please don't contact me again.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.628
I wish I could do that, General.

23:25.893 --> 23:29.043
But this is something
that you need to get for us.

23:30.134 --> 23:32.291
We shouldn't talk any longer right now.

23:32.670 --> 23:35.437
I'll be at Fort Lincoln Park
Thursday at nine p.m.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.906
Please bring the sensor.
Near the amphitheater.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.475
This way, everyone,
for the eleven o'clock tour.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.446
Eleven o'clock tour.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.255
In the historical record,

26:31.357 --> 26:34.758
he's described as gangly and awkward,

26:34.860 --> 26:37.261
but that's not the impression
we get here.

26:37.609 --> 26:41.264
This is an image of pride and dignity.

26:41.439 --> 26:44.768
Instead of reproducing
exact physical features,

26:44.870 --> 26:48.337
Houdon honors the essence
of Lafayette's character.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.408
His commitment to liberty,
to the dream of America...

26:52.869 --> 26:54.210
That's what we see.

26:54.499 --> 26:58.301
Houdon completed similar busts
of Washington and Jefferson.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.081
Jeremy?

27:06.164 --> 27:07.764
Jer... Hey, Jeremy.

27:08.088 --> 27:09.702
Oh. Hey, Philip...

27:09.727 --> 27:11.347
- I was just thinking about you.
- Oh yeah?

27:11.395 --> 27:13.205
Do we have you guys
all set up for this year?

27:13.230 --> 27:14.496
Italy, right?

27:15.579 --> 27:17.775
Look, we, uh...

27:18.436 --> 27:19.718
we found this place

27:19.743 --> 27:23.305
it's like a... budget place.

27:23.407 --> 27:25.273
W-What do you mean?

27:25.375 --> 27:26.575
I feel terrible about it,

27:26.600 --> 27:28.833
and Mary Lou's pissed at me,
but it's just...

27:28.905 --> 27:30.213
a lot cheaper.

27:30.347 --> 27:32.180
That's, like, their specialty.

27:32.272 --> 27:33.400
Budget travel.

27:33.425 --> 27:34.832
Well, we can always make adjustments

27:34.857 --> 27:35.956
if you're looking to do it cheaper.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.122
I just want to make sure

27:37.147 --> 27:39.391
you're staying in the right places,
having the best experience.

27:39.416 --> 27:40.737
No, I know, but...

27:40.890 --> 27:42.501
I don't want to nickel-and-dime you.

27:42.526 --> 27:43.691
The kids are in college, and...

27:43.716 --> 27:45.583
Yeah, no, no, of course.
I-I understand.

27:45.609 --> 27:46.908
Don't worry about it.

27:47.142 --> 27:48.707
- We'll come back.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:48.732 --> 27:51.933
There's... There's always
plenty more vacations to take.

27:52.649 --> 27:53.848
Next time, just tell me.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.353
We'll always take care of you.
You know that.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.724
I know, I know.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.432
Thanks, sorry.

27:58.464 --> 27:59.806
Yeah, no. It's, uh...

27:59.831 --> 28:01.490
It's great to see you.
Give my love to Mary Lou.

28:01.515 --> 28:02.564
- Will do.
- Yeah.

28:02.608 --> 28:05.160
- Same to Elizabeth.
- Yeah, yeah. Bye.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.024
Now, if everyone's ready,
we'll move on next

28:18.049 --> 28:20.215
to the diplomatic reception rooms.

28:20.395 --> 28:23.363
And again, you'll see
it's beautifully designed

28:23.465 --> 28:25.718
in the Neoclassical style.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.835
Did anybody see the woman
with blonde hair and glasses?

28:29.017 --> 28:30.984
She was here a minute ago.

28:31.093 --> 28:33.159
Can someone check the bathroom?

28:33.308 --> 28:34.491
Sure.

28:37.290 --> 28:39.224
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

28:50.551 --> 28:52.051
Close the door.

28:55.704 --> 28:58.903
I, uh... I just ran into Jeremy Branch.

28:59.003 --> 29:01.005
Oh. How is he?

29:01.255 --> 29:02.454
He's fine,

29:02.537 --> 29:05.170
but he booked his trip
through someone else.

29:05.719 --> 29:07.673
So, what happened?

29:07.940 --> 29:09.208
I don't know.

29:09.233 --> 29:11.113
Uh... the last I heard,

29:11.138 --> 29:13.205
he was going to discuss
the package with his wife

29:13.230 --> 29:14.596
and... and call me back.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.724
He booked through
some budget place instead.

29:17.777 --> 29:19.230
Shit.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.493
You should have stayed on top of it.

29:21.522 --> 29:23.354
You should have checked in with him.

29:23.518 --> 29:25.371
He was hard, Mr. Philip.

29:25.478 --> 29:27.712
He.. he's really your client,

29:27.761 --> 29:30.107
and... you have the relationship.

29:30.132 --> 29:31.798
He kept asking me, "What does..."

29:31.823 --> 29:32.986
What does Philip say?"

29:33.046 --> 29:34.979
You should have told me that.

29:36.569 --> 29:38.837
You've kept saying over and over

29:38.862 --> 29:41.162
to take personal responsibility.

29:41.341 --> 29:42.850
And you've been so busy...

29:42.908 --> 29:45.776
I didn't want you to lose the client.

29:49.317 --> 29:50.912
I understand the frustration.

29:50.959 --> 29:53.684
But these big bureaucracies
are all the same.

29:53.786 --> 29:56.419
The people above you
never want to make room.

29:56.521 --> 29:57.755
Look at me.

29:57.924 --> 30:01.138
I'm 65, and I'm still here.

30:01.567 --> 30:05.202
The best thing you can do
is broaden your horizons.

30:05.424 --> 30:06.990
Step outside the organization.

30:07.093 --> 30:09.259
Get a job somewhere else? Maybe.

30:09.905 --> 30:11.368
Come work with me.

30:11.470 --> 30:14.036
Or stay at State and get a PhD.

30:14.181 --> 30:16.271
You come back with a new set
of qualifications.

30:16.296 --> 30:17.383
They look at you different.

30:17.409 --> 30:19.443
Can you repeat that description for me?

30:19.511 --> 30:21.877
<i>Female, Caucasian, long blonde hair.</i>

30:22.046 --> 30:23.880
Hey, you know what?
It's so beautiful out.

30:23.982 --> 30:25.615
Let's take our food and go eat outside.

30:25.717 --> 30:27.917
I have to be back
upstairs in a half an hour.

30:28.019 --> 30:30.019
I'll have you back. Come on,
Patrick, I need some air.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.688
Hey, this is Briggs in the cafeteria.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.157
Uh, would you say that the woman...

30:34.259 --> 30:37.160
Ah.

30:43.814 --> 30:45.901
My deputy showed us some transcripts

30:45.950 --> 30:48.083
where Reagan is talking about it,

30:48.258 --> 30:50.161
if you look at them together,

30:50.561 --> 30:52.918
it's fairly clear that he thinks

30:52.943 --> 30:54.843
it's a complete missile defense.

30:55.018 --> 30:56.539
That's disturbing.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.781
I was talking to one of
Don Regan's aides this morning.

31:00.457 --> 31:01.903
You have to keep this to yourself.

31:01.958 --> 31:03.323
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:03.714 --> 31:06.188
He said that Regan
has been complaining about

31:06.229 --> 31:08.963
how crazy things are getting
around the Oval Office.

31:09.126 --> 31:10.625
How so?

31:10.727 --> 31:14.378
The President's been forgetful,
not focused.

31:14.437 --> 31:17.205
Almost a different person lately.

31:17.559 --> 31:20.901
The man I talked to said he thinks...

31:21.731 --> 31:24.038
that the President
might be going senile.

31:25.797 --> 31:29.210
I can't even fathom
the implications of this.

31:29.860 --> 31:31.379
Well, what can we do?

31:31.912 --> 31:33.314
Probably nothing.

31:34.211 --> 31:35.602
Weinberger and his cronies

31:35.627 --> 31:38.094
are even more hard-line than Reagan.

31:38.653 --> 31:41.388
And if he's slowly losing his mind...

31:45.527 --> 31:47.161
Anything new on the Summit?

31:47.593 --> 31:49.767
I'm still following Haskard's group.

31:49.865 --> 31:51.864
As far as I can tell, the next meet...

31:53.654 --> 31:55.001
Hello, my dear.

31:55.103 --> 31:57.571
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.906
Do you know Tchaikovsky?

32:00.008 --> 32:01.408
Oh, God.

32:01.575 --> 32:03.810
She's not a big classical music fan.

32:03.912 --> 32:06.346
Well, that's because
she doesn't know Tchaikovsky.

32:08.716 --> 32:10.583
<i>The Nutcracker,</i> right?

32:10.685 --> 32:11.918
Yeah.

32:12.020 --> 32:14.153
I took you to that ballet
when you were little.

32:14.256 --> 32:15.602
I remember.

32:16.191 --> 32:19.225
He's one of Russia's
greatest composers.

32:19.327 --> 32:20.851
His mother died when he was young,

32:20.876 --> 32:23.143
and his life was full of loneliness...

32:23.431 --> 32:25.431
This was the first record
I ever bought.

32:27.925 --> 32:30.870
For a long time after the War,

32:31.150 --> 32:33.539
it was the only music
I could listen to.

33:12.145 --> 33:16.513
Do our people ever use sex
to get information?

33:16.615 --> 33:17.931
What?

33:18.083 --> 33:20.915
I'm reading a book
about the organization,

33:20.940 --> 33:22.940
and it says that sex
is one of the techniques.

33:23.425 --> 33:25.489
There's a lot of bullshit
out there, Paige.

33:25.784 --> 33:27.558
Doesn't sound like bullshit.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.337
Well, they can make
anything sound believable.

33:29.362 --> 33:31.595
That's what sells books.

33:31.885 --> 33:34.832
- So that never happens?
- No.

33:47.872 --> 33:51.785
Look, I can't speak
for every officer, but...

33:52.325 --> 33:54.951
those relationships could

33:55.924 --> 33:59.032
turn into something different.

34:00.025 --> 34:02.136
You get very close to people,

34:02.760 --> 34:04.604
get to know them very well and...

34:04.844 --> 34:06.328
in certain circumstances,

34:06.985 --> 34:09.391
if the information's critical enough...

34:12.523 --> 34:14.703
people may cross lines sometimes.

34:16.708 --> 34:17.951
And then that gets twisted

34:17.976 --> 34:19.481
by whoever wrote that book.

34:19.551 --> 34:21.676
Have you heard stories
of this happening?

34:21.917 --> 34:25.047
I'm cut off from everyone else.
I don't hear stories.

34:25.149 --> 34:26.947
Where'd you find this book?

34:27.051 --> 34:29.118
A used book store, on Capitol Hill.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.621
I-I bought other books
on espionage and war,

34:32.723 --> 34:34.723
so it just looks like
I'm doing research.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.458
I paid with cash.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.840
Don't ever go to the library
for that sort of thing.

34:38.962 --> 34:41.195
Obviously.

34:41.398 --> 34:45.324
It's easy to see things
as very black and white.

34:46.476 --> 34:48.770
But the world's complicated.

34:48.871 --> 34:50.170
And the more that you get that,

34:50.196 --> 34:51.663
the better off you'll be.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.912
A bookstore out of town
would be better.

35:00.049 --> 35:01.049
I'll see you tonight.

35:01.151 --> 35:02.650
See you tonight.

36:00.007 --> 36:01.206
How are you?

36:01.767 --> 36:04.087
I don't think you give a shit
about that.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.315
I suppose you're right.

36:07.336 --> 36:09.236
I give a shit about my country,

36:09.352 --> 36:10.953
and it's in trouble right now.

36:11.055 --> 36:13.021
And whose fault is that?

36:14.253 --> 36:15.538
I can hardly tell you

36:15.563 --> 36:18.242
how much I never wanted
to see you people again.

36:19.496 --> 36:20.929
I can imagine.

36:20.997 --> 36:22.729
If you say so.

36:23.652 --> 36:26.032
You know...
the last time you came to me,

36:26.403 --> 36:28.320
a man wound up dead.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.579
I have nightmares about it.

36:34.594 --> 36:37.066
All those people I killed in Korea...

36:37.860 --> 36:40.172
and this is what I have
nightmares about.

36:45.477 --> 36:47.792
I'm not giving you the goddamn sensor.

36:48.591 --> 36:50.357
Or anything else.

36:51.707 --> 36:53.443
You should give it
some serious thought.

36:53.496 --> 36:54.628
Yeah.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.988
Well...

36:59.168 --> 37:01.126
you may think I'm a traitor.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.454
But I thought I was...

37:02.479 --> 37:05.540
I-I-I was trying to do
the right thing last time.

37:06.908 --> 37:09.730
Now I see how idiotic that was.

37:10.926 --> 37:12.746
That you used me.

37:13.381 --> 37:15.582
That's not going to happen twice.

37:16.879 --> 37:18.712
I don't think you're an idiot.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.254
If you don't give it to us,

37:21.356 --> 37:23.723
my people are going to expose
what you did.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.826
You'll go to jail. You'll be disgraced.

37:27.091 --> 37:30.212
If you bring us what we need,
it's over.

37:30.939 --> 37:32.560
You retire from the Air Force,

37:32.585 --> 37:35.201
we have no reason to come to you
ever again.

37:35.464 --> 37:37.036
This will be it.

37:37.978 --> 37:39.850
I think you're smart.

37:42.721 --> 37:45.010
Saturday night. Seven-thirty p.m.

37:45.112 --> 37:46.712
Huntley Meadows Park.

37:47.067 --> 37:49.880
Southeast corner, by the trail head.

38:35.968 --> 38:37.968
You need anything?

38:51.303 --> 38:53.069
Goddammit.

39:13.524 --> 39:15.144
What do you see?

39:18.923 --> 39:20.523
A... woman.

39:21.212 --> 39:23.011
What else?

39:28.045 --> 39:29.872
She's... upset?

39:31.274 --> 39:33.458
N-Nothing else in there?

39:38.655 --> 39:42.442
Well, you're not the first.

39:46.568 --> 39:49.053
But you're never gonna really see

39:49.113 --> 39:50.313
until you try to do it.

39:50.366 --> 39:53.370
Take that pad, turn to a blank page.

39:55.279 --> 39:56.678
What?

39:56.973 --> 39:58.439
You heard me.

40:05.074 --> 40:06.394
Take one.

40:06.614 --> 40:08.983
Trust me, I... I can't draw.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.787
Oh, that's not your problem.

40:11.996 --> 40:14.129
Sit, pencil.

40:21.230 --> 40:23.017
All right, look at that mug.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.230
Just that.

40:26.323 --> 40:27.978
It's not really a mug,

40:28.136 --> 40:29.869
it's light and dark.

40:30.105 --> 40:32.002
Just, that's all.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.155
Stare at it.

40:35.577 --> 40:37.112
Just draw the dark parts,

40:37.258 --> 40:39.158
don't draw the light parts.

40:43.152 --> 40:44.398
- I really...
- Shut up.

40:44.460 --> 40:46.526
Just draw what's dark.

40:55.563 --> 40:58.492
He was right in my face,
like... Ahhh! Ahhh!

40:58.517 --> 41:01.067
Come on, harmonize, harmonize!
Ahhh, ahhh...

41:01.169 --> 41:03.002
Oh man, that sounds crazy.

41:03.504 --> 41:04.536
Yeah.

41:04.657 --> 41:05.905
<i>Well, what about you? Why are you...</i>

41:06.100 --> 41:07.381
<i>Why are you in the office so late?</i>

41:07.462 --> 41:09.828
Oh, um...

41:11.505 --> 41:12.704
I don't know.

41:12.812 --> 41:14.056
<i>Well, I mean, you sound like</i>

41:14.081 --> 41:15.546
<i>you're about to jump out a window.</i>

41:15.648 --> 41:17.415
No, no, it's...

41:17.517 --> 41:19.775
Stavos kinda screwed up this week,

41:19.822 --> 41:20.863
so I'm just trying to figure out

41:20.888 --> 41:22.287
how I'm gonna deal with that.

41:23.239 --> 41:24.822
What did he do?

41:25.089 --> 41:28.225
<i>Well, I had this client from forever.</i>

41:28.327 --> 41:30.194
And I handed him off to Stavos

41:30.219 --> 41:32.186
and I just found out he dumped us.

41:32.496 --> 41:36.013
And this guy's been coming to me
for fifteen years.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.803
I booked every family vacation
he ever took.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.271
<i>Wow.</i>

41:40.373 --> 41:42.406
So why'd you hand him off
to Stavos, then?

41:43.149 --> 41:45.287
Well, we're bigger now.

41:45.312 --> 41:47.278
I can't deal with
every single customer.

41:47.507 --> 41:50.881
Yeah, but, I mean, he kinda
sounded like your customer.

41:51.106 --> 41:53.239
You sound like Stavos.

41:53.366 --> 41:55.519
Mr. Philip, Mr. Philip...

41:56.871 --> 41:58.789
Yeah, that, um...

41:58.891 --> 42:01.155
that really doesn't sound like Stavos.

43:03.206 --> 43:04.905
Stop.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.292
This is a mistake.

43:11.843 --> 43:14.240
You know that if you hurt me,
they'll kill you.

43:15.407 --> 43:17.220
I'm not going to jail,

43:18.220 --> 43:20.767
and I'm not going to betray my country.

43:23.072 --> 43:25.672
Wait, wait. Ju... Please!
Wait a second.

43:25.774 --> 43:27.608
M-Maybe I pushed too far.

43:27.950 --> 43:29.015
Doesn't matter.

43:29.193 --> 43:30.783
- It's too late.
- No, it's not.

43:30.880 --> 43:32.880
It's not too late.
Please, listen to me.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.416
You people don't pray, do you?

43:37.386 --> 43:38.519
No.

43:39.354 --> 43:42.723
Okay. Okay. Please.

43:45.761 --> 43:47.076
Please.

43:48.049 --> 43:49.282
I'm a mother.

43:49.371 --> 43:51.164
Really, I ha... I have children.

43:51.854 --> 43:54.501
Please, you don't have to do this.

43:54.855 --> 43:56.236
I... I have two children.

43:56.532 --> 43:57.647
Please, I am sorry.

43:57.672 --> 43:59.572
Whatever I did, it's not their...

44:32.912 --> 44:34.112
Mom!

44:34.137 --> 44:35.370
Mom, are you...

44:35.438 --> 44:37.572
Go back to your car now!

44:41.291 --> 44:43.411
Go back! Now!

44:44.491 --> 44:46.901
Follow the plan. Go!
