hey! what is this?
we've been waiting 40 minutes.

02:41.289 --> 02:44.543
for what? l told you last time
it was the last time.

02:44.584 --> 02:49.089
that's mean. l hear it's pretty
expensive to get a pilot's licence.

02:49.131 --> 02:53.218
about $80 an hour?
we're all here to subsidise you, man.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.846
l told you, no more.
didn't you get the message?

02:55.887 --> 02:59.725
l didn't get no message. what message?
my machine must be broken, all right?

03:00.475 --> 03:02.394
look, man...

03:03.687 --> 03:06.523
tell me you can really
afford to pass this up, all right?

03:06.565 --> 03:08.400
all right.

03:08.442 --> 03:10.527
but l'm only taking one of you.

03:18.869 --> 03:21.371
- now, watch it.
- killer.

03:24.124 --> 03:26.877
l shouldn't be doing this. why am l doing this?

03:26.918 --> 03:29.588
y ou're right.
l'd never give myself a lift, either.

03:29.629 --> 03:31.715
(boys singing)

03:32.799 --> 03:35.761
check it out. there's my mom's house,
my dad's house.

03:35.802 --> 03:39.431
- hey, there's my pizza hut.
- quiet down. l can't hear the radio.

03:39.473 --> 03:41.725
empty pool, two o'clock. cross street?

03:41.767 --> 03:45.020
uh... culver and alton.

03:45.061 --> 03:46.229
(cheering)

03:46.271 --> 03:49.900
lt's no good. there's a foot of water
down the deep end.

03:49.941 --> 03:52.360
oh, shit! look at that!

03:52.402 --> 03:56.490
- no!
- that's valhalla, the one with the pool guard.

03:56.531 --> 04:00.035
- there's too many workmen down there.
- who cares?

04:00.076 --> 04:03.330
- james, get us over to garden grove.
- james?

04:03.371 --> 04:06.750
y eah, please. that's what most drivers
are called, right?

04:06.792 --> 04:10.837
- y eah? well, not this driver.
- bingo! that's it, right there.

04:18.595 --> 04:20.680
y eah! let it rip!

04:23.058 --> 04:25.644
- gleam the cube, buddy.

04:55.674 --> 04:58.468

05:11.106 --> 05:14.985
- slam time.
- slammed pretty hard right there.

05:15.026 --> 05:18.613
- a refinishing job like this costs $2200.
- what do you want me to do?

05:18.655 --> 05:21.866
l gotta have the whole pool refinished again,

05:21.908 --> 05:25.662
have it acid-washed, drained,
just because these kids come in here.

05:25.704 --> 05:30.500
don't smear the blood around.
take your shoes off. l don't want scuff marks.

05:30.542 --> 05:33.670
y ou're in trouble.
we have a homeowners' association up here.

05:33.712 --> 05:36.881

05:36.923 --> 05:39.968

- l'm glad you're here, detective.

05:40.010 --> 05:44.848
can l sue them? can l sue his family?
l wanna know. l can sue their fathers?

05:44.889 --> 05:48.518
- let me get some details.
- can they sue us?

05:48.560 --> 05:51.730
- who are these people?
- my neighbours. come on, move it!

05:51.771 --> 05:55.525
- they think it's a block party.
- was there any damage done besides...

05:55.567 --> 05:57.235
- hey, get down.
- what?

05:57.277 --> 05:59.320
down. get down.

05:59.362 --> 06:01.448
pool owner: l'm getting a pit bull.
- ok.

06:01.489 --> 06:06.202
y ou guys, this was a dumb move.
or maybe you've figured that out already.

06:06.244 --> 06:08.538
come on, man. we don't need a lecture.

06:08.580 --> 06:12.667
aren't you supposed to read us
our rights or something, huh?

06:12.709 --> 06:16.046

06:32.479 --> 06:34.564
uh-oh.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.652
the skateboard stays in the garage.

06:39.694 --> 06:43.698
- lt's not gonna shit on the rug.
- smart guy. what do you want from us?

06:43.740 --> 06:47.786
to be like you? y ou think maybe
if l had your haircut l could sell more policies?

06:47.827 --> 06:50.330
lf l had your mouth,
l could close a deal every day.

06:50.371 --> 06:53.041
let's just go inside, please. thank you.

06:55.794 --> 06:57.879
mother: we're home.

06:57.921 --> 07:00.465

07:02.884 --> 07:06.012

07:07.931 --> 07:10.308
oh, come on. give him a break.

07:10.350 --> 07:12.101
given him too many.

anybody wanna help me with dinner?

07:18.191 --> 07:20.360
(rock music on headphones)

07:22.195 --> 07:26.866
* l?m skating down the street, you see,
and l run into a pop bottle

07:27.575 --> 07:29.619
* l fell over and broke my leg

07:29.661 --> 07:31.079

07:31.120 --> 07:34.123
jesus! chill out, man.

07:34.165 --> 07:36.626

- asshole.

07:37.502 --> 07:39.379
asshole?

07:40.505 --> 07:43.967
l take it back. y ou're a sloppy asshole.

07:44.008 --> 07:47.136
well, you know what they say. lt's a dirty job.

07:50.807 --> 07:52.308
they love you, you know.

07:55.144 --> 07:57.063
they don't know what to think of me.

07:59.399 --> 08:01.067

y eah, but it was a good move.

08:11.869 --> 08:13.955
jesus christ.

08:14.998 --> 08:17.917
look, everyone knows
you're the hero around here.

08:17.959 --> 08:20.878
will you be quiet? l am trying to concentrate.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.006
oh, my god.

08:25.008 --> 08:26.718
(knocking)

08:33.182 --> 08:35.351
- hi.

08:35.393 --> 08:37.895
just let me get my jacket.

08:38.813 --> 08:41.982
- hi, brian.
- hi.

08:42.025 --> 08:44.986

08:48.197 --> 08:50.074

08:50.116 --> 08:52.076
* ..have a kid and die!

08:52.118 --> 08:54.203

* l wanna do the x-plan, the eternal x-plan...

09:08.426 --> 09:10.928
l'll see you guys. bye-bye.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.393
- whoa!
- get out of the way.

09:17.435 --> 09:20.021
- y ou left this at home.
- shit.

09:20.855 --> 09:23.274
- geometry.
- l fixed a couple of the answers.

09:23.316 --> 09:27.236
y ou did ok. lf you put some effort
into it, you might even pass without me.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.572
all right, man.

09:30.782 --> 09:33.284
all right, you owe me one.

09:35.620 --> 09:40.041
by the way, brian, l always forget
which one of you guys is adopted.

09:41.334 --> 09:45.505
y eah, that's really funny, y abbo.
y ou're hysterical, man.

09:59.811 --> 10:02.146
k elly, come over here.

10:02.188 --> 10:07.193
my friend wants to meet you.
he doesn't believe your name is k elly.

10:07.235 --> 10:09.695
look, not today, ok, bobby? l'm late.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.908
don't worry, k elly. the colonel loves you.

10:13.950 --> 10:17.787
oh, no fresh vegetables. lt takes three weeks
for the boat to reach vietnam.

10:17.829 --> 10:20.915
we are just sending medical supplies.

10:20.957 --> 10:22.959
(speaks vietnamese)

10:23.000 --> 10:25.378
say hello to the family, please.

10:26.462 --> 10:29.090
- tina, put mr phong on the guest list.
- ok.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.970
y ou're late, vinh. very unusual.

10:34.011 --> 10:36.514
sorry, sir.
l got stuck on a calculus problem.

10:38.057 --> 10:40.810
no problem.
l'll take it out of your pay cheque.

10:40.852 --> 10:41.978
daddy.

10:43.312 --> 10:45.189
get to work.

11:31.152 --> 11:34.322
- colonel trac.
- did you finish already?

11:34.363 --> 11:38.409
there's something wrong with the
shipping weight of the last container.

11:38.451 --> 11:40.953
most of the items seem too heavy.

11:41.996 --> 11:43.998
500lb for a crate of cotton balls?

11:45.124 --> 11:48.919
colonel: so how long have you been
an expert in medical supplies?

11:48.961 --> 11:52.006
but, sir, there's a half a million
dollars involved.

11:53.049 --> 11:56.010
well, let's just say
l think somebody may be ripping us off.

11:57.303 --> 11:58.346
who?

11:59.597 --> 12:04.977
westpac medical supply is the distributor
and they have been handling all the shipping.

12:08.022 --> 12:10.816
nonsense. l'm sure this is just a clerical error.

12:11.859 --> 12:13.778
maybe.

12:13.819 --> 12:16.697
l know.
l?ll go double-check the last few shipments.

12:17.990 --> 12:19.658
wait.

12:20.743 --> 12:24.955
y ou've been working here for two weeks
now, and you're doing a good job.

12:24.997 --> 12:27.666
but l cannot have you spending time

12:27.708 --> 12:32.004
on shipments that have been paid for
and dispatched with no complaints.

12:32.963 --> 12:37.093
maybe l need an experienced person
to finish the job, ok?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.955
mother: hi.
- hi.

13:05.996 --> 13:10.459
- oh, honey. let me see that.
- what?

13:10.501 --> 13:14.046
- l bet you got that skating.
- l didn't notice.

13:14.088 --> 13:16.841
l wouldn't worry
if you'd buy some new safety pads

13:16.882 --> 13:19.260
or one of those helmets
l see the boys wearing.

13:19.301 --> 13:24.515
- they're all pretty expensive, mom.
- l know, but...you're worth it.

13:25.474 --> 13:28.519
- oh, no way!
- y eah, yeah.

13:28.561 --> 13:30.729
these are the most expensive.

13:30.771 --> 13:34.692
well, l shouldn't tell you this,
but l love to watch you skating.

13:34.733 --> 13:37.194
- y ou do?
- y ou know how clumsy l am.

13:37.236 --> 13:40.656
l can't believe a son of mine is so graceful.

13:40.698 --> 13:44.243
- y eah.
- well, sometimes he's graceful.

13:52.251 --> 13:54.378
oh, man. when did you start smoking?

13:54.420 --> 13:56.046
shut the door.

13:57.089 --> 13:59.925
- they don't know you smoke yet?
- l just started.

14:01.218 --> 14:03.304
that shit'll give you cancer, man.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.097
l'm in trouble.

14:06.390 --> 14:09.226
what? y ou got a b plus in calculus?

14:09.268 --> 14:12.771
y ou think you're pretty smart.
y ou think l'm an asshole.

14:12.813 --> 14:16.859
y ou think l just kiss up to mom and dad
and pay the rent with good behaviour.

14:19.486 --> 14:23.741
all right, look, l'm gonna step outside
and l'm gonna come back in.

14:23.782 --> 14:26.285
what do you say we start over, huh?

14:28.871 --> 14:31.040
(knocking)

14:31.081 --> 14:35.586
hey, vinhski. why the long face, pal?

14:36.629 --> 14:40.716
- maybe you and your friends are right.
- we are?

14:40.758 --> 14:42.926
y ou don't trust adults at all, do you?

14:45.721 --> 14:47.973
here's what l think.

14:48.015 --> 14:51.685
- adults are predictable.
- don't count on it.

14:51.727 --> 14:56.690
y eah? they're living under this illusion
that life as we know it

14:56.732 --> 14:59.234
is gonna continue for ever.

15:00.194 --> 15:03.113
so they expect you to behave
as though what you do today

15:03.155 --> 15:06.283
is gonna have an effect
on where you'll be in 30 years.

15:07.868 --> 15:12.456
l mean, it's ridiculous to think there's
gonna be anything in 30 years, you know?

15:14.958 --> 15:17.294
l don't know what's worse, you know?

15:18.379 --> 15:22.299
being blown up in a nuclear war
or having a 7-eleven on every corner.

15:22.341 --> 15:26.720
and what if the world doesn't blow up?
then where are you gonna be?

15:26.762 --> 15:28.097
l don't know.

15:28.764 --> 15:31.350
y ou're still mad
because they adopted me, huh?

15:32.017 --> 15:37.189
come on, man. look, it's been 1 1 years,
all right? y ou're not my problem.

15:40.192 --> 15:42.820
- what happened at work today?
- why today?

15:43.821 --> 15:45.906
cos you weren't like this yesterday.

15:48.033 --> 15:50.119
come on, man. what happened?

15:51.787 --> 15:56.166
one minute l thought l was doing
something right and the next minute...

16:00.003 --> 16:02.089
maybe l'm not the one who screwed up.

16:03.298 --> 16:05.592
l know l got those figures right.

he's an honest boy. he's no threat.

19:42.684 --> 19:45.145

oh, bullshit. l tie him up and l bring him here.

19:49.274 --> 19:51.568

(music ends)

31:24.426 --> 31:29.306
l?ll get you to bangkok but that?s it.
y ou can forget about the $50,000.

31:29.348 --> 31:32.643
bobb y: a plane ticket is easy.
l want the money.

31:35.729 --> 31:37.940

32:07.511 --> 32:09.888

32:09.930 --> 32:14.017
y ou were a soldier.
y ou've done your share of killing.

32:14.059 --> 32:16.770
lt was in defence of my country. this is different.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.939
- how is it different?
- this is murder.

32:18.981 --> 32:21.066
lt was an accident.

32:23.819 --> 32:26.738

33:41.271 --> 33:43.356
(car drives off)

34:22.062 --> 34:23.647
right here.

34:23.688 --> 34:26.942

34:26.983 --> 34:28.693

34:29.902 --> 34:34.533
let's go over it again. y ou get taken here.

34:34.574 --> 34:39.161
then the guy gets out of the car,
talks to a couple of other guys.

34:39.204 --> 34:44.376
- and then he's dead. who shot him?
- how am l supposed to know?

34:44.417 --> 34:47.754
expect me to stick my head out
and ask everybody to turn around?

34:47.795 --> 34:53.260
- hey, wise ass.
- ok, ok. back it up, then. back it up.

34:53.301 --> 34:56.847
y ou're in the back seat of the car
of the guy who was following you.

34:56.888 --> 34:59.307
- right.
- why was he following you?

34:59.349 --> 35:03.478
l don't know. he was just following me.
maybe he was a pervert.

35:03.520 --> 35:08.650
right. y ou jumped in the back seat of a
pervert's car? y ou playing hard to get?

35:08.692 --> 35:10.569
lf l had a dog with a face like yours,

35:10.610 --> 35:12.988
l'd shave his ass
and teach him to walk backwards.

35:13.029 --> 35:15.991
what'd you say? say that again. say it.

35:16.032 --> 35:18.952
whoa, whoa, whoa, big guy. hey.

35:18.994 --> 35:22.330
y ou, you little shit.
y ou just watch your goddamn mouth.

35:23.915 --> 35:26.835
l'm telling you,
it happened right here. l'm not lying!

35:26.876 --> 35:30.505
oh, no? y ou gotta hear what
it sounds like from where l'm standing.

35:30.547 --> 35:33.049
ok, get in the car.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.595
l said get in the car.

35:37.470 --> 35:40.098
oh, man.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.475
what do you think?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.979
there ain't shit here.

35:48.231 --> 35:51.234
y ou're really pissing me off.
don't waste people's time.

35:51.276 --> 35:56.281
look, he made a call from the payphone
at the arco station on cantella.

35:56.323 --> 35:59.826
the people he called
must have been the people he met here.

36:05.457 --> 36:08.001
oh, god.

36:08.043 --> 36:11.004
l'm waiting. ls there anything else?

36:12.088 --> 36:13.882
hm?

36:16.718 --> 36:18.803
l don't, uh...

36:21.056 --> 36:23.141
l don't think my brother killed himself.

36:26.394 --> 36:28.730
ok.

36:28.772 --> 36:31.733
ok. talk to me.

36:34.903 --> 36:37.739
my brother was not the type of kid

36:37.781 --> 36:40.617
who'd go into a motel and hang himself.

36:44.037 --> 36:47.499
so, l mean, l just wanted to find out
a little more about it.

36:48.583 --> 36:52.295
so l went to the motel for myself,
you know, just to check it out.

36:53.380 --> 36:57.634
and then this bobby nguyen guy
starts following me around.

36:57.675 --> 37:01.346
and then he comes here and
he gets killed, just the way l said it.

37:03.056 --> 37:07.477
- why would l make this up?
- l don't know.

37:10.605 --> 37:14.025
ok, ok. fine.

38:20.884 --> 38:22.969
ok.

38:24.929 --> 38:27.015

38:30.018 --> 38:32.937
l don't know. do you think l failed vinh?

38:32.979 --> 38:37.275
failed him? y ou fail math, not brothers, right?

38:39.777 --> 38:42.697
but you know what l mean.
maybe l am as bad as they say.

38:42.739 --> 38:44.657
- who says?
- everyone.

38:44.699 --> 38:48.870
agh! don't listen to the numbers,
the common herd.

38:48.911 --> 38:51.039
shine it on. y ou're different.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.165
(music stops)

38:52.206 --> 38:56.085
l'm different? have you checked
yourself out in the mirror this morning?

38:56.127 --> 38:58.296
that's an oversimplification.

38:58.338 --> 39:01.382
when l say different, l mean different.

39:01.424 --> 39:04.302
brian, you gleam the cube.

39:04.344 --> 39:06.304
huh?

39:06.346 --> 39:09.682
y ou're in worse shape than l thought.

39:09.724 --> 39:13.227
the cube, brian.
the place that you skate when you let go.

39:15.021 --> 39:17.899
don't worry. lt's an intangible.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.486
nine tenths of the people don't grasp it,
so l guess you're safe for now.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.531
l don't know. maybe l don't wanna be different.

39:25.573 --> 39:27.200
well, it?s not optional.

39:32.205 --> 39:36.084
l guess l could always just run away, you know?

39:38.127 --> 39:42.507
l wouldn't blame you, but you don't
wanna see your picture on a milk carton.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.719
listen, l'll tell you what.

39:47.595 --> 39:51.516
l'll see that they put your picture
on a six-pack of bud.

41:03.296 --> 41:05.339

41:33.784 --> 41:36.287
what does it look like?

41:40.499 --> 41:42.710
all right, look.

41:42.752 --> 41:45.755
l know how much
this means to you and your family,

41:45.796 --> 41:47.965
so l'm gonna tell you what l know.

41:48.007 --> 41:51.844
nothing l got right now says
your brother didn't commit suicide.

41:51.886 --> 41:53.971
- everything else says he did.
- well...

41:54.013 --> 41:56.557
the only reason
l'm even a teeny bit interested

41:56.599 --> 42:00.061
is your brother didn't register
at the motel the night he died.

42:00.102 --> 42:03.189
- he didn't? who did?
- l don't know who did.

42:04.649 --> 42:07.777
- bobby nguyen?
- l don't know that.

42:10.655 --> 42:15.493
what about the call he made
from the payphone at the gas station?

42:17.662 --> 42:21.207
y ou don't worry about that, ok?
l got that covered.

42:21.248 --> 42:24.877
now you do me one big favour
and you get outta here. l'm working.

42:24.919 --> 42:27.713

- what?

42:28.798 --> 42:31.467
well, look at you, man. y ou're a screw-up.

42:31.509 --> 42:35.179
hey, l was a screw-up too.
believe me, l know the symptoms.

42:35.221 --> 42:38.641
so you're saying you're not one any more?

42:38.683 --> 42:40.768
a screw-up, l mean?

42:42.061 --> 42:45.815
could a screw-up acquire
such wealth, power and prestige?

42:45.856 --> 42:49.235
- especially in orange county.
- y eah, well...

42:49.276 --> 42:52.905
so, what do you have against orange county?

42:52.947 --> 42:56.409

42:56.450 --> 43:00.955
y ou wanna piss me off?

43:09.296 --> 43:10.965
hey, pick it up!

43:21.684 --> 43:23.978

43:26.021 --> 43:29.483
sorry. y ou're... y ou're just trying to help.

43:30.609 --> 43:31.944
l'm being an asshole.

43:32.903 --> 43:34.655
all right, forget it.

43:35.448 --> 43:39.243
look, as soon as l know something
for sure, l?ll let you know, ok?

43:39.285 --> 43:41.370
right.

43:51.130 --> 43:53.591
automobile club.

44:01.515 --> 44:03.601
- hello. bolsa video.
- what?

44:03.642 --> 44:05.644
bolsa video. may l help you?

44:06.812 --> 44:09.857
uh...no. wrong number.

44:11.942 --> 44:13.736
bolsa video.

44:20.242 --> 44:22.328
hi.

44:29.877 --> 44:31.962
ow! god!

44:33.839 --> 44:35.925
busybody.

44:37.134 --> 44:39.637
got something about phone numbers?

44:40.596 --> 44:42.681
give me that.

44:44.558 --> 44:46.644
see you later.

44:48.187 --> 44:50.356
l figured something out.

44:50.397 --> 44:52.858
bobby nguyen called bolsa video.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.444
bolsa video is owned by colonel trac.

44:55.486 --> 44:59.323
my brother was working for colonel trac.

44:59.365 --> 45:01.533
trac and nguyen. that's two out of three.

45:02.326 --> 45:06.956
now all we have to do is find
the american, the guy who shot nguyen.

45:06.997 --> 45:09.667
brian, we ran a passport check.

45:10.709 --> 45:14.964
bobby nguyen, your bobby nguyen,
arrived in bangkok last night.

45:16.632 --> 45:19.843
- they're covering their tracks.
(phone rings)

45:19.885 --> 45:21.971
y eah, right. excuse me.

45:22.972 --> 45:25.099
lucero.

45:25.140 --> 45:27.017
just one moment, please. harv.

45:27.059 --> 45:30.145
- y eah.
- y ou take this.

45:34.650 --> 45:37.820
bobby nguyen saw this.
that's why he started following me.

45:37.861 --> 45:39.822
where'd you get this?

45:41.782 --> 45:43.242
my brother.

45:44.076 --> 45:46.161
why didn't you show it to me before?

45:47.830 --> 45:50.708
l figured you'd think
he was mixed up in drugs or something.

45:50.749 --> 45:52.626
drugs?

45:54.044 --> 45:57.172
nick. take a look at this.

46:00.634 --> 46:02.720
what's that say?

46:04.638 --> 46:05.931
(speaks vietnamese)

46:05.973 --> 46:10.352
antibiotics, 200lb. bandages, 800lb.

46:10.394 --> 46:12.229
(speaks vietnamese)

46:12.271 --> 46:14.273
alcohol, 500 gallons.

46:14.314 --> 46:17.359
lt's a list of medical supplies and quantities.

46:17.401 --> 46:19.194
thank you, nick.

46:20.028 --> 46:23.282
y our brother was working
for the relief fund, right?

46:25.576 --> 46:29.288
he was over there during the war,
working in lntelligence.

46:29.329 --> 46:31.832
and you can keep this.

46:34.626 --> 46:38.130
well, then, what about
the motel registration, the other guy?

46:38.172 --> 46:39.965
look, brian,

46:41.049 --> 46:44.178
l think it's time to let it go.

46:45.262 --> 46:49.057
lt was a suicide. that's what the coroner found.

46:49.099 --> 46:53.312
we gave it a shot, but that's the way
it's gonna go down in the books.

46:53.353 --> 46:56.273
- they killed my brother.
- y ou're not listening to me.

46:56.315 --> 46:59.651
y ou're the one who's not listening!
they killed my brother!

48:11.306 --> 48:14.184
brlan: vinh, we gotta talk.

48:15.435 --> 48:19.606
y ou started something
and l don't know how to finish it.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.236
y ou were always good at that.

48:24.277 --> 48:26.363
finishing, l mean.

48:29.032 --> 48:33.829
remember that aircraft-carrier model?

48:33.870 --> 48:39.126
l bought it, but l couldn't follow the
instructions, so you put it together.

48:41.044 --> 48:43.422
l guess that was always the thing.

48:45.048 --> 48:47.843
y ou were always one step ahead.

48:50.470 --> 48:52.973
l could never catch up.

48:55.267 --> 48:57.436
that really pissed me off.

48:57.477 --> 49:00.397
so l just gave up. l stopped trying.

49:01.481 --> 49:03.316
lt's funny, huh?

49:04.401 --> 49:06.111
l mean...

49:06.778 --> 49:13.493
now it seems everybody else
has given up on you except me...a screw-up.

49:16.204 --> 49:18.707
l'm not giving up on you.

49:24.755 --> 49:26.840
l miss you, vinh.

49:30.761 --> 49:33.889
l mean, l hate doing my own homework.

50:29.194 --> 50:31.279
here.

50:33.448 --> 50:36.451
so, what do you want?

50:36.493 --> 50:38.578
well, uh...

50:40.372 --> 50:42.874
lt's kind of hard to explain.

50:44.417 --> 50:47.504
l want us to be friends.

50:47.545 --> 50:51.007
- brian, we can't.
- why not?

50:51.049 --> 50:56.263
l'm sure that on your planet there must
be someone for you to be friends with.

50:56.304 --> 50:58.723
lt wouldn't be any better for you than for me.

50:58.765 --> 51:01.142
we don't have anything in common.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.062
we have vinhy.

51:06.481 --> 51:08.108
not any more, we don't.

51:09.192 --> 51:12.028
and it?s more complicated than that.

51:12.070 --> 51:14.739
look, l'm gonna be honest with you.

51:14.781 --> 51:19.452
my father won't let me see american boys,
even as friends.

51:19.494 --> 51:21.955
- l don't understand.
- y ou don't have to.

51:21.997 --> 51:26.209
hold on. hold on. what?

51:26.251 --> 51:29.254
and even if he would, brian,

51:29.295 --> 51:31.798
would you look at yourself?

51:34.342 --> 51:37.679
y eah. l get it.

51:37.721 --> 51:39.806
l'm sorry.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.906
hi, honey.

52:39.032 --> 52:41.117
oh, my...

52:45.663 --> 52:48.583
oh! look at you.

52:49.417 --> 52:50.960
what do you think?

52:55.298 --> 52:57.383
hi, dad.

52:58.426 --> 53:00.678
(crashing)

53:02.138 --> 53:04.224
whoo!

53:07.310 --> 53:08.937
oh, my god.

53:11.314 --> 53:14.859
- hey, check out k elly.
- oh, no.

53:14.901 --> 53:17.111
quick! dial 91 1 !

53:18.780 --> 53:21.491
- halloween's in october, brian.
- so?

53:21.533 --> 53:23.576
so why are you in that costume?

53:23.618 --> 53:26.663
l know. he must have sent everything
to the cleaner's.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.874
- his mom put him up to it.
- y eah. rip it up.

53:29.916 --> 53:33.419
- hey, where's your board?
- l felt like walking today.

53:33.461 --> 53:35.797
now, now, now. we have to talk about this.

53:35.838 --> 53:39.759
- l can't right now.
- nice threads, k elly.

53:39.801 --> 53:41.678
(laughter)

53:41.719 --> 53:43.888
oh, no!

53:46.057 --> 53:47.141
hi.

54:00.697 --> 54:02.573
(shouting in vietnamese)

54:02.615 --> 54:06.411
- no american boys!
- (speaks vietnamese)

54:07.412 --> 54:13.459
(speaks vietnamese) ..discrimination.
what does it mean to you?

54:13.501 --> 54:16.921
americans can come to your store
but they can?t come to your home?

54:21.801 --> 54:23.386
hi.

54:23.428 --> 54:25.972
father, mother, you remember brian k elly.

54:26.014 --> 54:28.766
brian, this is my father and this is my mother.

54:28.808 --> 54:30.810
- hi.
colonel: this is quite a change.

54:32.312 --> 54:34.355
y eah, my hair.

54:34.397 --> 54:37.692
l guess we all do
unexpected things sometimes, don't we?

54:37.734 --> 54:39.777
y es, l suppose we do.

54:39.819 --> 54:43.114
brian, if we want to get to
an eight o'clock movie...

54:43.156 --> 54:45.616
would you like to come in and have some tea?

54:45.658 --> 54:48.953
- y eah, that'd be nice.
- some other time, mother.

54:48.995 --> 54:51.289
l think we should.

54:51.330 --> 54:55.376
lf the colonel doesn't mind,
there's a million questions l'd like to ask him.

54:55.418 --> 54:57.712
- questions?
- brian, we have to go.

54:57.754 --> 55:02.008
y eah. about... about history.

55:02.925 --> 55:06.054
about what really happened in vietnam,
you know.

55:06.095 --> 55:09.265
l think it would help me understand
what happened to my brother.

55:10.349 --> 55:14.020
someday, perhaps, but you have your movie.

55:16.522 --> 55:18.357
- right.
- bye.

55:19.442 --> 55:21.986
good night. thanks.

55:24.530 --> 55:29.535
so, what else does your father do
besides send medicine?

55:29.577 --> 55:33.039
- lsn't that enough?
- l don't know.

55:33.081 --> 55:37.001
he does that all by himself? that's amazing.

55:37.043 --> 55:39.253
he has plenty of help.

55:39.295 --> 55:42.048
all vietnamese
or does he work with some americans?

55:42.089 --> 55:47.178
how would you like it if l was talking
and talking about your father all night?

55:47.220 --> 55:51.974
l guess l'd say, ''catch you later.''
so what shall we talk about, then?

55:52.016 --> 55:56.145
well...how about skateboarding?

55:56.187 --> 55:59.148
- y eah?
- y eah. what's so great about it?

56:00.233 --> 56:04.111
lt's something l can do by myself.
there's nobody there to judge me.

56:04.153 --> 56:06.197
y ou know?

56:06.239 --> 56:08.741
lt's just a way l can express myself.

56:10.910 --> 56:13.162
lt's like...

56:13.204 --> 56:16.249
l don't know how else to say it.

56:17.333 --> 56:18.793
and you've stopped?

56:20.920 --> 56:21.963
y eah.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.716
hey, brian. catch this.

56:25.758 --> 56:29.929
brlan: this is stupid, man.
vlnh: come on. lt?s your birthday.

56:31.389 --> 56:35.101
vlnh: come on.
father: come on, brian. brighten up.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.520
y ou?d brighten up a room just by leaving it.

56:37.562 --> 56:40.356
come on, now. let?s have a three-way catch.

56:40.398 --> 56:43.109
- throw it to me.
vlnh: ready?

56:43.150 --> 56:46.070
father: all right! oh-ho!
brlan: l hate frisbees.

56:46.112 --> 56:49.073
- lt?s all yours, brian!
- l don?t wanna play this.

56:50.908 --> 56:54.495
mother: brian! come on, honey.
open some of your presents.

56:54.537 --> 56:58.374
look, happy birthday.
come on. come on. brian.

56:58.416 --> 57:00.209
(clears throat)

57:00.251 --> 57:02.420
- l'm home.
mother: give me that.

57:02.461 --> 57:04.463
(video stops)

57:04.505 --> 57:06.591
so how are you?

57:09.510 --> 57:14.307
that's the first time in your life
you've ever asked me that question.

57:15.975 --> 57:18.185
um...

57:18.227 --> 57:20.313
how's work?

57:21.647 --> 57:24.984
lt's awful hard to think
about actuarial tables or fire indemnity

57:25.026 --> 57:27.028
when l can't get vinh off my mind.

57:29.572 --> 57:31.073
y eah, l know.

57:33.034 --> 57:38.080
we always said vinh was special
because we chose him.

57:39.665 --> 57:41.542
we chose him.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.214
but how did that make you feel?

57:49.800 --> 57:54.013
(sighs) brian, what did l ever do for you?

57:57.725 --> 58:00.686
y ou... y ou took me to disneyland.

58:02.396 --> 58:05.107
once, when you were six.

58:05.149 --> 58:10.237
y eah. and they threw me out of the park
for pissing on donald duck.

58:14.450 --> 58:17.578
l was difficult before you adopted him, dad.

58:21.499 --> 58:26.545
anyway, that... that's all in the past.

58:28.756 --> 58:30.633
just like vinh?s death.

58:32.593 --> 58:35.137
y ou can't blame yourself.

58:38.015 --> 58:40.101
are you giving me advice?

58:43.020 --> 58:44.897
y eah, l guess so.

58:46.982 --> 58:48.859
l'll take it.

59:10.589 --> 59:14.510
ha! he's on a bicycle!

59:14.552 --> 59:17.888
next thing you know, he'll be riding a scooter.

59:17.930 --> 59:20.766
brian, we found a killer pool, man.

59:20.808 --> 59:23.561
40-foot kidney, 1 0 feet deep.

59:23.602 --> 59:27.064
the pool's empty
and the house burned down last week.

59:27.106 --> 59:29.358
he burned it down.

59:29.400 --> 59:32.778
- no, not today, man.
- not today? why?

59:35.197 --> 59:39.618
brian, everybody knows that
you're blaming yourself for vinh's...

59:41.579 --> 59:45.207
well...for the way that he died.

59:48.168 --> 59:51.005
but l want you to know that your friends,

59:51.046 --> 59:53.340
you know, we still think about you.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.011
thanks.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.723
what's gotten into him, man?

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:04.184
l don't know, but if l get it, shoot me.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.312
(y elling)

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:15.988
(speaks vietnamese)

01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:26.540
(applause)

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.586
(speaks vietnamese)

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.129
(microphone feedback)

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:35.883
the press is here and for their benefit
l?d like to remind them

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:40.220
that we are here today to celebrate relief

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:44.391
in the form of the vietnamese
anti communist relief fund.

01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:48.145
- hi.
- hi.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:51.982
- y ou look nice.
- thanks.

01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:53.567
so do you.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.989
uh, what's... what's this?

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.700
don't you like vietnamese food?

01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:06.455
my parents always made a federal case about it.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.833
they said l had to eat it just to be nice to vinh,

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.836
so, of course, l had to be a jerk.

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:15.381
besides, it's always seemed kind of weird.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:20.135
what about american food?
y ou don't think a chilli dog's weird?

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.972
look, you can't be scared of chao tom.
lt's just shrimp over sugar cane.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:29.561
- and this is rice flour with shredded shrimp.
- ed! ed!

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.023
- chao ong, mr phong.
- long time no see.

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.150
what are you doing this far from the farm?

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:39.196
- who's that guy?
- mr lawndale?

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:42.533
tlna: he owns westpac medical supply.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:47.579
and he arranges the shipping
for my father?s relief programme.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:49.540
- why?
- uh...nothing.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:51.667
lawndale.: let me buy you a coffee.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:57.274
jesus.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:48.992
jesus christ.

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:51.578
someone broke in last night
and opened a crate.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.581
lt contained 50 rifles and 20,000...

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.044
thank you.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:03.840
50 rifles
and 20,000 rounds of ammunition.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:06.843
nothing was taken. lt might have been a doper.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.846
we get a few of those.
but it might not have been.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:12.182
l want nothing
to compromise the movement.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.727
the movement? colonel, l'm worried about me.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:18.105
- but we have a common bond.
- no.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:24.736
l have 30 sam missiles, 1 ,000 m1 6s
and half a million rounds...of ammunition.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:28.532
- and l've moved them.
- where? my people are waiting for them.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:35.163
they'll just have to wait a little longer, that's all.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.128
do you ever think about the future?

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.841
y ou mean, what do l wanna be when l grow up?

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.218
y eah.

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.721
l don't know.

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:55.016
l used to wanna be a veterinarian,

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:59.771
on a farm, you know, horses and cows.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.315
y ou on a farm?

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.943
y eah. l used to wanna live in the country.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.321
but know what a farm vet does?

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:12.617
helps cows get well so they live long enough
to be turned into quarter pounders.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.746
- lt's ridiculous.
- how'd you get to be so cynical?

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.416
practice.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:28.300
- can l ask you something personal?
- sure.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.801
uh...

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.721
where... where's the bathroom?

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.517
thanks.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:48.129
- what are you doing?
- just checking out this map.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.423
l wanted to find out where vinh...

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:54.511
my parents just pulled in.
y ou'd better go out the back door.

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:56.846
didn't they know l was coming over?

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.266
why did you risk that?

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:01.476
just hurry.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.937
quick. quick.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.982

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.575
(fireworks explode)

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.765
- what was it?
- l don't know. l think they're inside.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.893
cover me, ok?

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.694
what the heck is going on here?

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.407
- fireworks.
- y ou gotta be kidding me.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:22.825

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.453

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:32.542

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:36.130
(shouting and banging on door)

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:36.023
- watch your backs! coming through!
- come on! let's feed it over here!

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.860
- where the hell were you guys?
- round the other side.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.195
lawndale:
what do you think l pay you for?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.825
- l can't be in two places at once.
- l want a report on my desk first thing.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:48.745
wait a minute. look at this.

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:51.914
what's that? give me that goddamn thing.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.460
son of a bitch!

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.420
flreman: let?s get some ladders here!

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:03.217
(thunder rumbles)
flreman: the help of the heavens, huh?

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:07.138
flreman #2: y eah, look at that.
flreman #3: thank god.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.475
flreman: hose that right there.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.810
flreman #2: roll it up, sandy!

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:15.938
tell engine company 1 3
that they can go on back.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.734
y ou moved everything out,
so no-one can find anything. we're safe.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:23.029
- what makes you think you're so safe?
- what do you mean?

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:27.408
we're in this together, right?
we share a common bond, remember?

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:31.204
lf it happened to one of us,
it could happen to the other.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.626
americans, they're all crazy.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.883
get tina and go to tang's house.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:48.554
y ou promised me. no more war.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:50.848
lt was all over.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:54.602
y ou said no more war.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:57.063
daddy, what's going on?

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:59.315
go to your uncle tang's house right away.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.150

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.947
- nothing.
- then why do l have to go?

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.963
- who is it?
- detective lucero.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.594
detective lucero, mr k elly.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.513
- remember me?
- y eah.

01:12:30.554 --> 01:12:33.683
l'd like to talk to your son

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.061
lt's been raining. huh.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:44.735
now, listen to me.
l don't like bullshit, not from anybody, ok?

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:47.530
least of all from someone
l've gone out on a limb for.

01:12:47.571 --> 01:12:51.909
now, l can't pin that fire on you right now,
but l know you set it

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.537
and that makes it a whole different ball game.

01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:58.249
y ou don't go around setting fires.
l don't care what your problem is.

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:02.003
somebody had to shake their tree.
y ou said so yourself.

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.381
by the rules.
but you don't like rules, do you?

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:09.927
no, you're above the rules, right?
well, let me give you a piece of news.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:13.389
l was the one guy in the universe
that listened when you talked.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.850
now there's nobody.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.252
brian?

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:48.507
jeez. what are you doing here?

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.017
god, you're soaked!

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.187
let me get you a towel.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.315
here we go.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:06.442
just dry off there.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.737
everything's falling apart.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.322
sit down.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:15.117
l was supposed to go to my uncle's house.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:16.744
my father told me to go.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:22.291
he's in some kind of trouble
and l'm really scared.

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:28.464
- sorry.
- what do you have to be sorry for?

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.676
causing you trouble.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:39.183
my friendship with an american boy
is the least of my troubles.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.613
y ou know, l really like you.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:14.301
- what time is it?
- lt's almost six.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.845
oh, my god. this is still damp.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.517
l have something here you could try.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.440
here you go.

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:32.152
l'll give this back to you later.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.280
no problem.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.616
thanks, brian.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:47.126
- what's this?
- nothing. lt's just an old lighter.

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:50.879
- this is my father's.
- l got it at some army surplus store.

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:55.259
the american ambassador
gave this to my father in 1 972.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.885
lt has his name on it.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:07.563
any way l try and explain it,
it's gonna come out all wrong.

01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:09.273

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:30.419
do you have any idea what we were
going through? where were you?

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.797
- what happened to vinh?
- why ask me about that now?

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.716
what happened to vinh?

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:40.387
- who have you been speaking to?
- how did he die?

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.849
he killed himself.
how would l know more than you?

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:48.103
lt wasn't about guns, daddy?
lt wasn't about mr lawndale?

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:52.608
lt's his brother, isn't it?

01:16:52.649 --> 01:16:54.526
all of this.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.653
l don't blame him for what he's done.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.991
l'd have done anything. anything.

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:16.840
vinh k elly's death was an accident.
y ou have to believe one thing about me.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:21.136
whatever l've done,
l've done for our vietnamese nation.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.973
his brother.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:29.978
y ou don't know what the boy's done.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.192
leave me now.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:38.028
l have something to take care of.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:43.200
he's a kid? and he did it alone? christ.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:47.079
as long as he's keeping it between him
and us, you know what has to be done.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.831
no, ed. l'm out.

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:57.214

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:17.896
jeez!

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:30.534
so, why were they following you?

01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:36.414
- they said lawndale wanted to see me.
- mm-hm. that's not what they say.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:41.628
they say you called them
fucking faggot slant-eyed gooks.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:44.631
that really sounds just like me, you know?

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.216
oh, yeah?

01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:49.970
y ou ready to tell me about the fire?

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:52.097
what fire?

01:20:56.852 --> 01:21:00.522
- are you scared, brian?
- no.

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.279

- sweetheart, just...

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:34.264
- look at this. lt's trashed.
- lt's just a skateboard, sweetheart.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:36.891
the most important thing is that you're all right.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:41.688
who was the other guy,
the one that got lucky and rode off?

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.732
what other guy?

01:21:43.773 --> 01:21:48.069
come on. y ou don't think he'd be
protecting you right now, do you?

01:21:48.111 --> 01:21:50.196

l don't have time to jerk around.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:14.697
the lawyers are getting angry,
but l told them they were still in processing.

01:23:16.699 --> 01:23:20.829
