WEBVTT

00:44.574 --> 00:47.806
Why is this
happening?

00:47.901 --> 00:50.943
Balloons float, everybody knows
that.

00:53.182 --> 00:54.653
How'd I even get here?

00:56.541 --> 00:58.782
So far out to sea.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.334
So far from my little Liz.

01:04.030 --> 01:07.389
I don't know how long I can hang
on.

01:09.469 --> 01:10.463
No.

01:11.486 --> 01:12.894
I've got to get back to her.

01:15.261 --> 01:16.511
I must survive.

02:32.510 --> 02:33.534
Hey.

02:34.270 --> 02:35.390
Hey!

02:57.405 --> 02:58.526
Mm.

02:58.621 --> 03:01.406
I know, life is so hard.

03:01.502 --> 03:03.486
Oh, my gosh.

03:40.893 --> 03:41.853
Mirianthi.

03:43.134 --> 03:46.365
I told you, call me Mira.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.550
Okay, Mira.

03:49.469 --> 03:51.516
Why don't you take those
perfect little buns of yours

03:51.613 --> 03:53.214
and go grab me another cold one?

03:56.061 --> 03:58.588
If I wanted to be a slave to a
man,

03:58.685 --> 04:01.086
I would have stayed in the
village.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.173
Oh, you're not a slave.

04:06.269 --> 04:07.261
Okay?

04:09.085 --> 04:11.453
More like I'm your knight
in shining armor, right?

04:11.549 --> 04:12.542
Hm?

04:16.541 --> 04:17.565
You love me, baby?

04:19.486 --> 04:21.566
How much do you love me, Jack?

04:21.661 --> 04:22.654
Oh.

04:23.581 --> 04:25.534
More than all the money in the
world.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.542
We have enough now.

04:35.101 --> 04:38.301
That's something a poor man
would say.

04:40.157 --> 04:41.181
What? What?

04:42.685 --> 04:44.478
We can't do this forever.

04:45.406 --> 04:46.621
You want to go back?

04:46.718 --> 04:51.359
Give up on all of our dreams,
huh, in seeing the world?

05:25.437 --> 05:26.430
Hi.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.181
Uh, hi.

05:33.277 --> 05:34.846
We called ahead.

05:35.838 --> 05:40.541
Oh, Mrs. Katherine and
Elizabeth Brown from Russia?

05:40.638 --> 05:42.013
That's us.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.309
Long story, I'm from
America, she's Russian.

05:45.405 --> 05:47.614
Anyway, my company booked an
apartment.

05:47.709 --> 05:49.789
Yes, yes. It's all taken care
of.

05:49.885 --> 05:51.709
I just need you to register.

05:51.806 --> 05:52.862
Sure. Yeah.

05:55.453 --> 05:57.693
Liz, passports.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.005
Ah.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.093
Eh.

06:03.837 --> 06:04.831
Oops.

06:08.317 --> 06:10.493
What the hell, Liz? How could
you?

06:10.590 --> 06:12.158
Still got your phone, huh?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.942
I was texting my bestie.

06:15.037 --> 06:18.654
I finally made new friends.

06:18.749 --> 06:21.661
And you dragged me away from
them!

06:21.757 --> 06:24.316
This is us now, unless you
want to go live with Helga?

06:24.413 --> 06:25.916
Germany wasn't that bad.

06:26.013 --> 06:28.637
At least Aunt Helga
treated me like an adult.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.685
No, adults don't lose
passports.

06:30.780 --> 06:31.933
I'm tired, okay?

06:32.028 --> 06:33.245
Quit shaming me.

06:34.429 --> 06:36.702
Not too tired to call
your loser friends.

06:37.692 --> 06:40.029
You're just pissed
'cause I've got friends.

06:40.126 --> 06:42.878
Those things you never had.

06:42.974 --> 06:45.629
Miss Brown, I can call the
port.

06:45.726 --> 06:46.846
Someone will find them.

06:48.382 --> 06:51.934
And if not, Monday, the
embassy's open.

06:52.029 --> 06:52.956
Relax.

06:53.053 --> 06:54.014
You're in paradise.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.805
Yeah. Mm.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.052
Really?

06:57.149 --> 06:58.397
Shut up.

06:58.494 --> 07:00.190
We have our town festival
tomorrow.

07:00.285 --> 07:02.397
I'm sure your daughter will love
it.

07:02.493 --> 07:03.869
- Oh, she's my sister.
- She's my sister.

07:05.566 --> 07:06.718
I'll take these.

07:10.142 --> 07:13.086
Could you have room service
bring us, like, a sandwich?

07:13.181 --> 07:14.781
We haven't eaten since the
Aegean.

07:14.878 --> 07:16.796
Oh, I'm afraid the kitchen is
closed,

07:16.893 --> 07:20.062
but maybe downstairs in the
nightclub.

07:22.204 --> 07:23.710
Okay.

07:23.805 --> 07:24.798
Liz!

07:50.492 --> 07:51.677
Hi. Dr. Goldman?

07:52.765 --> 07:55.005
Sorry I missed your call and
it's so late.

07:57.949 --> 08:02.110
Yeah, she's, like, really tired
and...

08:02.205 --> 08:05.181
No, no, I know that
could trigger another...

08:05.277 --> 08:06.845
Look, I brought all the
prescriptions.

08:06.940 --> 08:09.822
I even brought them on my
carry-on and...

08:09.918 --> 08:11.901
So apart from that
episode, six months ago,

08:11.996 --> 08:13.852
she she's doing really good.

08:13.948 --> 08:17.309
Just a normal teenager.

08:17.404 --> 08:18.206
No, don't worry. Don't worry.

08:18.302 --> 08:19.518
I'm working on it and...

08:20.669 --> 08:22.525
Okay. Thank you so much for
calling.

08:22.621 --> 08:23.645
Speak soon.

08:24.702 --> 08:25.694
Goodnight.

08:31.357 --> 08:33.021
Liz, this bag isn't gonna unpack
itself.

08:33.118 --> 08:35.486
Why don't you just try
a little responsibility?

10:08.445 --> 10:09.437
Mira.

10:10.493 --> 10:11.868
Hey.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.261
Ah.

10:24.413 --> 10:26.556
You waiting for someone?

10:28.573 --> 10:31.261
You left your man in the room?!

10:31.356 --> 10:33.053
No, not me.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.173
Single gal.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.269
So let's dance!

10:39.645 --> 10:40.638
Let's dance.

10:41.533 --> 10:42.333
Dance!

10:42.429 --> 10:44.092
No, no, thanks.

10:44.188 --> 10:45.052
Come on!

10:45.148 --> 10:46.108
- No, no, no, no.
- You'll feel better.

10:46.204 --> 10:46.941
- No.
- Please.

10:47.997 --> 10:48.861
Let's dance.

10:48.957 --> 10:49.884
Come on.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.229
All right.

11:00.060 --> 11:00.829
Oh.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.021
Hello.

11:13.117 --> 11:13.980
Andreas.

11:14.076 --> 11:15.069
Mira.

11:18.013 --> 11:19.037
Welcome.

11:20.637 --> 11:21.693
Hey.

11:21.789 --> 11:23.101
- Join us.
- Hey.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.838
Hold on, hold on. Picture,
picture.

11:35.548 --> 11:37.500
Is this yours?

11:37.596 --> 11:38.589
No.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.533
Champaign, please.

12:08.189 --> 12:09.180
Perfect.

13:28.637 --> 13:31.965
Yeah, you know, it's
been really fun, guys,

13:32.062 --> 13:34.430
but, oh, yeah, I really have to
go.

13:34.524 --> 13:36.509
No, she can't go yet.

13:37.564 --> 13:38.556
Wait, hold on.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.702
I own a hot air balloon.

13:40.798 --> 13:41.790
Maybe...

13:42.718 --> 13:43.901
- Yeah?
- Wow.

13:43.996 --> 13:44.764
What do you say?

13:44.861 --> 13:46.812
An experience of a lifetime.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.117
- Yeah, I-
- Come on, be my friend.

13:50.877 --> 13:51.966
Okay!

13:52.061 --> 13:53.086
Woo!

13:57.020 --> 13:58.044
To friendship!

13:58.140 --> 13:59.132
Friendship.

13:59.228 --> 14:01.404
- Friendship.
- Friendship.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.493
Oh.

14:14.558 --> 14:15.614
Come on!

14:15.709 --> 14:17.468
The sun is coming up!

14:56.669 --> 14:58.334
All right, we have arrived.

15:01.212 --> 15:02.301
Where's the balloon?

15:03.932 --> 15:05.500
Can I just get just a little
trust?

15:05.596 --> 15:06.588
Just a little would be nice.

15:06.684 --> 15:07.836
I just pinged my location.

15:07.933 --> 15:10.460
My sister now knows where I am.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.861
Look, it's right over there.

15:12.957 --> 15:13.917
The wind's picking up.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.069
- Nick.
- Oh.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.060
Help me out?

15:16.156 --> 15:17.181
Help me out, Nick.

15:18.173 --> 15:19.357
Let's go. Come on.

15:25.693 --> 15:26.974
It's over here.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.532
Look, go tether it up.

16:41.629 --> 16:46.620
- Okay.
- Ladies, shall we?

17:00.028 --> 17:01.116
Woo!

19:50.940 --> 19:52.731
Yeah, just pull on
it, just a little bit.

19:54.525 --> 19:55.325
Just a little bit.

19:56.252 --> 19:57.246
All right.

20:55.773 --> 20:56.766
Shh!

21:16.987 --> 21:19.388
Hello.

21:19.484 --> 21:21.244
Why are we moving?!

21:25.596 --> 21:27.229
Don't look at me.

21:27.323 --> 21:29.469
They were tight. Tighter
than a tick's tush.

21:29.564 --> 21:30.684
You didn't tie 'em to the
basket, man.

21:30.780 --> 21:32.443
Dude, you never said,
"Basket."

21:32.541 --> 21:33.950
There's two ends to the rope.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.003
You understand?

21:35.100 --> 21:36.029
Loss of humor.

21:36.125 --> 21:36.861
No biggie, right?

21:36.957 --> 21:38.428
What are you, stupid?

21:39.677 --> 21:40.701
Oh, my God.

21:40.796 --> 21:42.652
Oh!

21:42.749 --> 21:44.412
- Idiot, man!
- Come on!

21:44.509 --> 21:45.820
Oh, my, ah!

21:45.915 --> 21:47.260
Ah!

21:47.357 --> 21:49.052
Stop it!

21:49.148 --> 21:50.300
Cut it out!

21:50.395 --> 21:53.085
Whoa, what is wrong with you?!

21:53.180 --> 21:54.204
- Stop!
- Guys!

21:55.163 --> 21:55.899
What?!

21:55.995 --> 21:57.949
We have a problem.

22:20.029 --> 22:22.300
Andy, do something!

22:25.148 --> 22:25.885
Go!

22:25.980 --> 22:26.973
Go up!

22:29.212 --> 22:30.141
No, what are you, nuts?!

22:30.237 --> 22:31.773
Get this crate down now!

22:31.869 --> 22:33.468
No, Andy! Up!

22:33.563 --> 22:35.867
Land this goddamn crate now,
Andreas!

22:35.965 --> 22:37.276
Shut up!

22:37.372 --> 22:38.364
Get down!

25:00.317 --> 25:01.596
Nick!

25:01.692 --> 25:02.813
Where is Nick?

25:06.620 --> 25:08.701
Get me something from the
first aid kit!

25:08.796 --> 25:10.140
Don't take it out!

25:10.235 --> 25:11.868
Get me something out of the kit!

25:26.971 --> 25:28.060
Hold his arm.

25:29.692 --> 25:31.964
Ah, what are we gonna use?!

25:39.707 --> 25:40.732
Don't move!

25:40.828 --> 25:41.821
Don't move!

25:44.381 --> 25:45.979
Don't move! It's okay!

25:46.077 --> 25:47.101
It's okay!

25:47.963 --> 25:50.619
I know!

25:54.812 --> 25:56.316
It's okay. It's okay.

25:56.413 --> 25:58.204
I got you. It's okay.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.164
It's okay.

25:59.261 --> 26:00.477
The burner...

26:06.013 --> 26:07.004
Oh!

26:08.060 --> 26:09.053
Help!

26:10.620 --> 26:12.027
A man!

26:12.123 --> 26:13.084
Call the cops!

26:13.180 --> 26:14.300
Police!

26:29.755 --> 26:30.652
Hey!

26:30.747 --> 26:32.251
Nick?!

26:32.348 --> 26:33.437
- Nick!
- Nick!

26:33.532 --> 26:35.035
Hey!

26:35.132 --> 26:36.317
Nick!

26:36.412 --> 26:37.980
It's too high. He won't make it.

26:38.076 --> 26:39.901
- Over here!
- Hang on!

26:39.996 --> 26:41.500
Hey!

26:41.597 --> 26:42.460
- Too far!
- Nick!

26:42.556 --> 26:44.219
- Where are you?
- Come on!

26:44.315 --> 26:45.052
No!

26:45.148 --> 26:46.716
Nick! Here I am!

26:46.811 --> 26:47.805
Nick! Here!

26:49.116 --> 26:50.524
Keep swinging!

26:50.620 --> 26:51.387
Nick, Nick!

26:53.468 --> 26:54.461
- Nick!
- Nick!

26:57.468 --> 26:58.940
- Come on!
- Here I am!

26:59.036 --> 27:00.029
- Nick!
- Nick!

27:06.108 --> 27:07.132
Down.

27:07.227 --> 27:08.764
Down, down.

27:08.860 --> 27:09.852
Down.

27:09.948 --> 27:10.941
Come down.

27:12.988 --> 27:13.981
Come here.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.851
It's okay.

27:17.949 --> 27:18.941
It's okay.

27:19.741 --> 27:21.021
I'm right here.

27:22.427 --> 27:24.315
I'm right here. It's okay.

27:24.412 --> 27:25.564
It's okay.

27:25.661 --> 27:30.652
It's okay.

28:01.468 --> 28:03.068
Hi, this is Mira.

28:03.164 --> 28:05.627
Please leave your message after
the beep.

28:05.723 --> 28:07.484
One golden rule:

28:09.467 --> 28:10.812
Target must be alone.

28:11.772 --> 28:13.531
A simple task for any normal
woman,

28:13.628 --> 28:16.444
but I suppose that's one
way for a woman like you

28:16.539 --> 28:17.692
to repay her man, huh?

28:21.499 --> 28:22.972
You better put that beach
house in your wedding

28:23.067 --> 28:24.572
on that list for Santa.

28:25.756 --> 28:26.781
Yeah.

28:27.581 --> 28:30.237
If we get caught, there is no
us.

28:30.332 --> 28:31.836
Your words, baby.

28:32.732 --> 28:33.725
Remember?

28:35.164 --> 28:36.156
Your words.

29:14.269 --> 29:15.549
Have you seen my phone?

29:21.531 --> 29:22.876
My boss is gonna kill me.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.788
Boss?

29:25.883 --> 29:27.387
You said it's yours.

29:27.484 --> 29:28.603
Your business.

29:32.924 --> 29:33.852
I just work ground crew.

29:33.948 --> 29:36.572
Just look after it for the
pilot.

29:36.668 --> 29:38.940
You mean you use it to impress
women!

29:40.923 --> 29:41.691
It's okay.

29:41.788 --> 29:43.549
Are you even allowed to fly
it?!

29:50.236 --> 29:51.229
No.

29:58.779 --> 29:59.804
Where's Nick?

30:11.899 --> 30:12.893
Dammit!

31:04.411 --> 31:06.236
Yeah, hello?

31:09.339 --> 31:12.124
This is the one, the little
American.

31:12.219 --> 31:15.515
She spent the night here,
no payment, no passport,

31:15.611 --> 31:17.916
with her accomplice, her oldest
sister,

31:18.013 --> 31:21.884
who abandoned her after
spending all night at the club.

31:22.717 --> 31:23.676
Go on.

31:23.772 --> 31:27.164
Then she dreamt about
a man with a knife,

31:27.260 --> 31:30.395
breaking into their room,
going through her suitcase,

31:30.492 --> 31:31.709
which, by the way, this sort of
thing does

31:31.804 --> 31:33.116
not happen in this hotel.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.187
The night duty concierge?

31:36.284 --> 31:37.340
Already tried.

31:37.436 --> 31:38.908
She must be asleep now.

31:39.004 --> 31:39.997
Back on tonight.

31:41.468 --> 31:44.093
By the numbers, I have
to look into it and assess.

31:44.188 --> 31:45.307
Yes.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.396
Here you are.

31:47.387 --> 31:48.347
Thank you.

31:48.444 --> 31:49.436
Yup.

32:14.396 --> 32:15.389
This isn't good.

32:16.380 --> 32:17.627
We need to land.

32:17.724 --> 32:20.603
We need land to land.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.524
I have to get back.

32:22.620 --> 32:25.789
Maybe Nick landed in the
water and he's still alive.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.821
Not from this
height.

32:45.307 --> 32:46.589
Still no signal.

32:47.642 --> 32:48.668
We're too far out.

32:51.835 --> 32:53.851
Can you steer this
thing?

32:53.948 --> 32:55.772
Look, we're going by the wind.

32:57.947 --> 32:58.940
Which is where?

33:01.947 --> 33:02.939
It's hard to say.

33:04.252 --> 33:06.940
The air currents are different
up here.

33:07.035 --> 33:08.859
If we stay low, maybe...

33:10.139 --> 33:13.563
The warm air should drag us back
to land.

33:13.660 --> 33:14.652
"Should"?

33:15.578 --> 33:16.572
It's worth a shot.

33:20.763 --> 33:21.788
What?

33:24.283 --> 33:25.339
The tank's empty.

33:30.172 --> 33:31.165
Okay.

33:32.221 --> 33:33.724
You're gonna have to do it.

33:33.819 --> 33:35.131
How?

33:36.699 --> 33:37.756
It's easy.

33:37.852 --> 33:39.548
Turn off the burner.

33:39.645 --> 33:42.556
Okay. Now, close the valve.

33:42.652 --> 33:43.612
There.

33:46.236 --> 33:47.325
Unhook the hose.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.564
Screw it into that tank.

33:53.660 --> 33:54.876
There you go.

33:54.972 --> 33:56.443
And make sure it's tight.

33:57.340 --> 33:58.876
All right, now loosen the valve.

34:01.210 --> 34:02.203
A little more.

34:03.197 --> 34:04.765
All right, now check the gauge.

34:05.851 --> 34:06.875
Look at the gauge.

34:06.970 --> 34:08.315
Check the gauge.

34:15.932 --> 34:19.676
So we just keep flying
until we see land?

34:19.772 --> 34:20.763
Not exactly.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.036
We've got about only this much
gas

34:23.131 --> 34:26.875
for an hour maybe, maybe two,

34:29.148 --> 34:30.268
then we're going down.

34:31.931 --> 34:32.923
No land.

34:34.108 --> 34:35.708
In the water.

34:37.757 --> 34:39.516
I can't. I can't go into water.

34:41.051 --> 34:41.787
It's okay.

34:41.883 --> 34:42.619
Balloons float.

34:42.716 --> 34:43.707
Baskets float.

34:45.722 --> 34:46.972
This is 400 kilos.

34:49.083 --> 34:54.107
We're going all the way down,
and so am I with this leg.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.756
I was just trying to show you a
good time.

34:59.867 --> 35:02.203
You lied. You're not even a
pilot.

35:02.299 --> 35:03.389
I can captain it.

35:03.484 --> 35:05.371
I know everything there
is to know about aerostat.

35:05.468 --> 35:07.484
Enough to kill Nick and drown
us all?

35:07.579 --> 35:09.180
No, no one's gonna drown,
okay?

35:09.274 --> 35:11.100
I can't drown.

35:16.987 --> 35:18.652
I can't leave Liz.

35:18.747 --> 35:19.740
Who's Liz?

35:21.947 --> 35:24.957
My little sister. I left
her asleep in the room.

35:26.586 --> 35:28.251
She's in your apartment?

35:28.348 --> 35:30.331
But you said you were alone.

35:30.426 --> 35:31.643
No, I said I was single.

35:31.739 --> 35:33.404
Look, she's just a kid,

35:33.499 --> 35:36.859
but she'll wake up and she'll
figure it out, you know?

35:36.955 --> 35:38.715
Someone will be coming for us
soon.

35:41.980 --> 35:42.971
Right?

35:50.491 --> 35:52.892
What if we get caught?

35:56.124 --> 35:59.164
Then, no money, no house,

36:00.604 --> 36:01.628
no babies,

36:02.811 --> 36:03.804
no us.

36:04.924 --> 36:07.644
We're never gonna get caught.

36:07.739 --> 36:09.242
Never.

36:09.338 --> 36:10.332
You wanna know why?

36:11.132 --> 36:12.731
'Cause you're too damn good,

36:14.108 --> 36:17.627
and I could never, ever,
do this without you.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.404
What if I leave?

36:27.483 --> 36:29.435
You better pray I never find
you.

36:38.619 --> 36:39.611
Kidding.

36:40.764 --> 36:42.748
Baby, I'm kidding, I'm
kidding, I'm kidding.

36:42.844 --> 36:43.996
One more week. That's it.

36:44.091 --> 36:44.955
Golden rule.

36:47.964 --> 36:50.684
And then we go and we go.

36:52.251 --> 36:56.124
We go see the world, together.

37:26.492 --> 37:28.156
Hey, over there, is that a
boat?

37:40.348 --> 37:41.436
- Help!
- Hey!

37:42.588 --> 37:44.028
Over here!

37:44.123 --> 37:45.116
Help!

37:47.899 --> 37:49.211
Help!

37:49.308 --> 37:50.300
Help!

37:53.243 --> 37:55.387
Hey, guys, look!

37:55.484 --> 37:56.476
Look!

38:01.980 --> 38:03.036
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:04.027 --> 38:05.532
- Over here!
- Hey!

38:05.627 --> 38:06.331
Hey!

38:06.426 --> 38:07.482
- Hey!
- Hey, guys!

38:07.578 --> 38:08.891
- Hey!
- Over here!

38:09.914 --> 38:11.419
Hey!

38:11.515 --> 38:13.594
- Hey!
- Over here!

38:13.690 --> 38:14.525
Help!

38:29.339 --> 38:30.428
Hey!

38:32.156 --> 38:33.338
Shit!

38:33.434 --> 38:34.428
Hey!

38:36.251 --> 38:37.243
Okay.

38:38.683 --> 38:39.772
We're coming!

38:43.132 --> 38:44.124
Okay.

39:02.907 --> 39:03.868
I'm coming!

39:04.988 --> 39:06.013
Throw the rope!

39:06.107 --> 39:06.940
Throw the rope!

39:07.035 --> 39:09.595
Throw the rope while I tie it
on.

39:09.691 --> 39:10.684
Hurry up!

39:16.890 --> 39:18.236
Freaking myself!

39:29.242 --> 39:31.100
All right, no, no, just give it
to me.

39:31.195 --> 39:32.283
You're gonna have to go in,
okay?

39:32.378 --> 39:33.082
No, no, no!

39:33.179 --> 39:34.427
- Going in!
- I can't swim.

39:34.524 --> 39:35.612
I can't swim.

39:41.755 --> 39:42.844
Okay. Okay.

39:43.804 --> 39:44.988
- Okay.
- Come on.

39:45.084 --> 39:45.852
Come on, go.

39:45.948 --> 39:46.715
- Come on.
- Okay!

39:46.811 --> 39:48.668
- Go, go.
- Get back!

39:50.076 --> 39:51.227
Come on.

39:51.323 --> 39:52.476
Stop!

39:57.468 --> 39:58.492
Get back!

39:59.452 --> 40:00.444
I'm coming!

40:01.435 --> 40:02.299
Hey!

40:04.315 --> 40:05.307
Shit!

40:22.459 --> 40:25.499
I need something heavy, to aim.

40:25.595 --> 40:26.971
No, it's mine, mine.

40:27.068 --> 40:27.804
What?

40:27.900 --> 40:29.180
What? No, give it to me!

40:31.099 --> 40:32.124
Come on!

41:12.474 --> 41:15.036
Hey, do you see that?

41:15.131 --> 41:16.667
What are they doing there?

41:16.764 --> 41:19.612
Do you think the coast guard
is sending out spy balloons?

41:21.306 --> 41:24.411
Nah, it's probably just some
conservationist or something.

41:24.507 --> 41:25.947
Just keep it in for now, okay?

41:26.044 --> 41:27.708
- Okay.
- We need that catch.

41:27.804 --> 41:28.828
Aye, aye, sir.

41:56.570 --> 41:57.978
You took too long!

41:58.074 --> 41:59.259
You should have jumped down!

41:59.355 --> 42:02.107
You selfish piece of shit!

42:02.203 --> 42:03.323
You're selfish!

42:03.419 --> 42:06.908
You're so selfish!

42:07.003 --> 42:08.603
Boat! The boat's leaving!

42:08.698 --> 42:09.723
The boat's leaving!

42:09.819 --> 42:11.260
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

42:15.292 --> 42:16.827
- Hey!
- Help!

42:16.922 --> 42:17.658
Help!

42:17.755 --> 42:19.004
Hey!

42:19.100 --> 42:20.956
- What do you need?!
- Hey!

42:21.052 --> 42:23.291
A written invitation?!

42:23.388 --> 42:24.348
Huh?!

42:29.596 --> 42:31.035
The banner. The banner.

42:31.130 --> 42:32.123
Banner.

42:34.012 --> 42:34.748
Okay.

42:34.843 --> 42:35.835
Okay.

42:38.267 --> 42:40.252
Whoa! What are you doing?!

42:41.370 --> 42:42.364
Shh.

42:44.602 --> 42:45.434
Ah!

42:48.410 --> 42:49.403
Ah!

42:53.339 --> 42:54.267
Okay.

42:54.364 --> 42:55.260
Hold me.

42:55.354 --> 42:56.923
- Hold me.
- What?

42:57.018 --> 42:58.428
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

42:59.803 --> 43:01.084
Oh, my God.

43:01.180 --> 43:02.204
Oh, my God.

43:07.195 --> 43:09.915
Just let it go. We don't need
it.

43:14.394 --> 43:17.243
Come on! I can't keep holding
you!

43:17.340 --> 43:18.811
I'm gonna lose you! Come on!

43:18.907 --> 43:20.731
Please come back up!

43:21.818 --> 43:25.403
Okay, give me your hand.

43:25.500 --> 43:26.683
- Give me your hand!
- I can't move!

43:26.778 --> 43:28.859
- I can't move!
- I can't put my hand out.

43:28.955 --> 43:30.171
Come on, reach for my hand!

43:50.171 --> 43:51.387
Something to write with.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.923
What's something that
everyone could understand?

44:01.882 --> 44:02.907
SOS?

44:04.666 --> 44:05.659
Okay.

44:12.059 --> 44:13.051
S.

44:14.204 --> 44:15.228
Shit.

44:16.826 --> 44:19.866
But I don't have any more.

44:19.962 --> 44:20.987
I need something...

44:22.139 --> 44:23.227
I don't know.

44:28.411 --> 44:29.403
I...

45:17.530 --> 45:18.555
Come on!

45:18.651 --> 45:19.834
Just read it!

45:19.930 --> 45:21.146
Please!

45:21.242 --> 45:22.234
Please!

45:22.332 --> 45:23.324
Come on!

46:08.731 --> 46:09.723
Good morning.

46:09.819 --> 46:10.554
Good morning, madam.

46:10.650 --> 46:11.611
Is the girl here?

46:11.707 --> 46:12.699
Yes. Over there.

46:16.027 --> 46:17.082
Hi, hon.

46:17.179 --> 46:18.652
You must be Liz.

46:21.049 --> 46:22.203
I came as soon as I could.

46:22.299 --> 46:23.195
Is the officer here?

46:23.291 --> 46:24.570
Yes. He's upstairs.

46:24.667 --> 46:26.362
You don't mind if I
take her away, do you?

46:26.459 --> 46:28.060
Please. Be my guest.

46:32.379 --> 46:33.531
We're just gonna take a little
ride down

46:33.626 --> 46:35.450
to child protection, hm?

46:35.546 --> 46:38.907
Find out who you are, contact
your folks, immigration.

46:39.004 --> 46:40.732
Get a doctor to check you over.

46:42.266 --> 46:43.354
It'll be fine.

46:43.450 --> 46:45.562
They'll have ice cream there and
cartoons.

46:45.659 --> 46:46.812
Do you like cartoons?

46:48.348 --> 46:51.482
I'm gonna stay here
and wait for my sister.

46:51.579 --> 46:52.795
Sorry, hon.

46:52.890 --> 46:54.107
Rules are rules.

46:54.202 --> 46:55.194
If you want to find your sister,

46:55.290 --> 46:56.826
then you've got to come with me.

46:56.923 --> 46:59.484
Hey, helping folks is my job.
Hm?

47:59.035 --> 48:00.027
Thank you.

48:04.155 --> 48:05.403
You cut your forehead.

48:13.658 --> 48:15.194
What's with the mirror?

48:19.163 --> 48:21.020
It was my grandmother's.

48:21.979 --> 48:23.195
My lucky charm.

48:35.899 --> 48:37.659
Ugh, not again.

48:53.466 --> 48:54.620
Have they been from the
embassy?

48:54.714 --> 48:55.483
And gone.

48:55.579 --> 48:56.442
That's one good thing.

48:56.539 --> 48:57.756
Call me when you have any news.

48:57.851 --> 48:58.619
I have to go now.

48:58.716 --> 48:59.803
A jumper just came in.

48:59.899 --> 49:00.891
Mm-hm.

49:04.827 --> 49:06.331
Yes. Second floor?

49:06.426 --> 49:08.155
Clean out room 202, please.

49:27.963 --> 49:29.499
I remember this.

49:40.507 --> 49:41.499
Lighter.

49:49.050 --> 49:50.394
It's in Andrea's pocket.

49:54.299 --> 49:56.667
We need fire, fast.

49:56.762 --> 49:57.723
Okay.

49:57.818 --> 49:58.906
Spark.

49:59.002 --> 49:59.994
Friction.

50:00.890 --> 50:01.883
No, no, no, no.

50:03.003 --> 50:04.155
Sunlight?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.139
Like a glass lens.

50:06.235 --> 50:07.259
Something...

50:07.355 --> 50:08.700
Champagne bottle.

50:16.442 --> 50:17.818
No. No.

50:17.915 --> 50:19.483
No.

50:19.579 --> 50:20.572
Uh.

50:23.963 --> 50:25.339
A condom.

50:25.434 --> 50:26.491
What?

50:26.588 --> 50:27.548
It's perfect.

50:27.643 --> 50:29.083
Nick's Cypress vodka.

50:31.835 --> 50:32.827
Open. Open it.

50:34.012 --> 50:35.355
Okay.

50:35.450 --> 50:37.499
Put this on the top.

50:37.595 --> 50:38.555
Okay.

50:38.650 --> 50:39.772
Gently turn it over.

50:41.435 --> 50:42.427
Okay.

50:51.514 --> 50:52.507
Raise your hand a little bit.

50:52.602 --> 50:55.707
Just put your fingers
together, just so I can...

51:02.746 --> 51:03.483
Ow.

51:03.579 --> 51:04.986
Sorry, sorry.

51:05.082 --> 51:06.842
We need something small and dry.

51:22.876 --> 51:24.059
Good.

51:24.155 --> 51:25.883
Okay, put it in the burner.

51:41.659 --> 51:43.929
We have the Share app.

51:44.025 --> 51:45.433
We both can see where we are.

51:45.530 --> 51:47.099
Kate's idea, keeping tabs.

51:47.194 --> 51:48.219
See?

51:49.050 --> 51:49.978
I know that place.

51:50.075 --> 51:50.843
Field's not far from here.

51:50.938 --> 51:52.571
It's a tourist spot.

51:52.667 --> 51:53.563
Let's go.

51:53.659 --> 51:55.194
Hold on. Does it say she's in
danger?

51:55.290 --> 51:58.044
Kate? No, I guess.

51:58.139 --> 51:59.323
I mean, the signals can't...

51:59.419 --> 52:01.211
I can't reach her.

52:01.307 --> 52:02.555
It's not on our way, hon.

52:02.652 --> 52:04.283
I've only got an hour
to get you processed.

52:04.379 --> 52:05.114
Processed?

52:05.210 --> 52:06.586
Taking a half day. Shopping.

52:06.683 --> 52:10.907
And while my sister's in danger,
and that guy in our room.

52:15.323 --> 52:17.915
Try to understand, you're
neglected,

52:18.011 --> 52:20.730
left alone in a foreign country,
hungry,

52:20.827 --> 52:22.522
while she sat in the
bar all night drinking.

52:22.618 --> 52:25.210
Go there, ask her yourself.

52:25.307 --> 52:27.195
No need to process anybody.

52:27.291 --> 52:29.242
And you can hit the mall early.

52:37.978 --> 52:38.971
- You win.
- Yeah!

52:40.251 --> 52:41.819
Who said kids are dumb?

52:48.571 --> 52:49.788
This will be safer.

52:52.858 --> 52:53.818
Right?

52:53.913 --> 52:56.634
I didn't know money made so
much smoke.

52:56.730 --> 52:57.723
What?

52:58.938 --> 53:00.443
Very smokey, I didn't know.

53:02.010 --> 53:03.035
You genius.

53:03.836 --> 53:06.075
Smoke signals. You're a genius.

53:06.171 --> 53:07.195
That's a good idea.

53:08.665 --> 53:10.170
What can we burn?

53:11.515 --> 53:12.507
Yeah.

53:20.570 --> 53:22.010
Nice trick with the condom.

53:23.194 --> 53:24.251
College education.

53:27.482 --> 53:28.826
Expensive.

53:28.922 --> 53:30.267
It was a good investment.

53:32.282 --> 53:35.546
I never had the chance to be
educated.

53:35.642 --> 53:38.747
I was trapped in a backwards
place.

53:39.675 --> 53:41.626
No opportunities.

53:41.723 --> 53:42.715
No future.

53:45.945 --> 53:49.755
To be a woman like you, smart,
strong,

53:52.059 --> 53:55.163
see the world, escape.

53:56.442 --> 53:57.723
That was always my dream.

54:03.227 --> 54:05.402
No, I'm not strong.

54:06.651 --> 54:07.675
I'm a coward.

54:10.458 --> 54:13.627
If I had jumped, Andreas
would still be here.

54:15.130 --> 54:16.570
It's not your fault.

54:20.379 --> 54:22.522
I'd give anything to see Liz
again.

54:22.618 --> 54:25.754
She really needs me, but I
shouldn't have dragged her here.

54:25.851 --> 54:28.283
You wanted to take care of
your sister.

54:28.379 --> 54:29.532
What's wrong with that?

54:30.586 --> 54:32.155
I'd even forgive those
morons on the yacht

54:32.250 --> 54:33.275
if they'd come back.

54:42.171 --> 54:43.162
Good.

54:44.858 --> 54:45.787
Hoo!

54:45.883 --> 54:47.323
Hoo, that smells.

54:48.731 --> 54:49.819
Smoke signal!

56:04.730 --> 56:05.787
Woo!

56:09.913 --> 56:10.906
Sophia!

56:11.803 --> 56:12.794
That's Kate!

56:13.946 --> 56:15.739
She's in a balloon.

56:15.834 --> 56:16.827
Look.

56:21.243 --> 56:24.251
Oh, that last guy looked
torched.

56:24.346 --> 56:25.498
Yeah. I wouldn't know.

56:27.706 --> 56:30.139
Which way is the wind
blowing?

56:30.234 --> 56:32.922
In the morning, out to
sea, towards that wind farm.

56:35.899 --> 56:37.563
They landed there?

56:37.658 --> 56:38.683
Maybe.

56:44.986 --> 56:46.363
What's behind?

56:46.459 --> 56:48.538
The town and then the sea.

56:48.634 --> 56:50.618
Oh, so what are we
waiting for?!

57:02.458 --> 57:03.643
Pilot's phone number.

57:03.739 --> 57:04.699
I'll call.

57:05.465 --> 57:06.554
Pays to work smart.

57:13.690 --> 57:14.618
Good morning.

57:14.715 --> 57:16.762
My name is Sophia, U.S.
Consulate.

57:16.857 --> 57:19.545
I see your air balloon is flying
today.

57:19.642 --> 57:21.242
Where are you located right now?

57:30.618 --> 57:32.794
30 minutes. Maybe.

57:32.890 --> 57:34.330
There's always another way.

57:56.475 --> 57:58.235
Give me your phone.

57:59.418 --> 58:01.562
I wish I would have
remembered this sooner.

58:03.098 --> 58:04.666
See that little hole?

58:04.762 --> 58:07.867
You put a little wire in
there and that's your antenna.

58:07.963 --> 58:09.595
So you might get a better
signal.

58:12.282 --> 58:13.241
Oh.

58:13.338 --> 58:14.331
We need this.

58:23.994 --> 58:24.954
Come on.

58:37.434 --> 58:38.427
Yeah.

58:43.449 --> 58:44.346
It's good enough. It's good
enough.

58:44.443 --> 58:45.435
It's good enough.

58:47.930 --> 58:48.986
I understand.

58:49.083 --> 58:50.075
Thank you.

58:50.875 --> 58:52.091
I'll inform them myself.

58:54.490 --> 58:55.354
Hm?

58:55.450 --> 58:56.699
The pilot's on vacation with
his wife

58:56.794 --> 58:57.786
and parents right now.

58:57.882 --> 59:00.570
And now, wants to report
his balloon stolen.

59:00.667 --> 59:02.235
And my workload just doubled.

59:05.338 --> 59:06.618
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

59:07.834 --> 59:09.850
Hold it in. Hold it in, tight.

59:09.945 --> 59:10.938
Mm-hm.

59:15.226 --> 59:16.538
She's pinged.

59:16.635 --> 59:17.562
Somewhere in the sea.

59:17.658 --> 59:18.683
Let's go!

59:20.665 --> 59:21.787
No, no!

59:21.882 --> 59:22.778
No!

59:22.874 --> 59:24.634
- No, no.
- Did it send?

1:00:10.330 --> 1:00:11.546
I have a fix.

1:00:11.642 --> 1:00:12.985
Let's go.

1:00:13.081 --> 1:00:14.361
Out to sea?

1:00:14.457 --> 1:00:16.601
I'm thinking coast guard,
sweetie.

1:00:16.698 --> 1:00:17.914
We need to hire a boat.

1:00:18.010 --> 1:00:19.163
- That's all.
- Okay.

1:00:19.259 --> 1:00:20.282
How much money do you have?

1:00:20.378 --> 1:00:21.883
Documents, license?

1:00:21.978 --> 1:00:23.258
Don't you have any?

1:00:29.177 --> 1:00:30.489
Here.

1:00:30.585 --> 1:00:31.449
Latest model.

1:00:31.546 --> 1:00:34.074
I know you love expensive
things, so...

1:00:34.171 --> 1:00:35.675
I'm not gonna buy your phone.

1:00:35.770 --> 1:00:37.626
But someone in port will take
it.

1:00:37.722 --> 1:00:38.714
I don't think so.

1:00:45.881 --> 1:00:48.025
Kate is U.S. citizen!

1:00:48.122 --> 1:00:50.171
It's your job to help!

1:00:56.698 --> 1:00:58.234
Now, let's stop wasting time.

1:01:16.251 --> 1:01:18.810
Good morning, sir.

1:01:18.906 --> 1:01:22.459
So what do you want to tell
me?

1:01:22.554 --> 1:01:24.026
I was just sitting there-

1:01:24.123 --> 1:01:25.210
- At dawn?

1:01:25.306 --> 1:01:27.483
Yes, just to get a good spot,
you know?

1:01:28.922 --> 1:01:30.714
You've got blood on your
forehead.

1:01:32.410 --> 1:01:36.859
Yes, that hit me when
he came down real hard.

1:01:36.954 --> 1:01:38.587
So he wasn't run
over by-

1:01:38.682 --> 1:01:40.283
- He must have jumped.

1:01:40.377 --> 1:01:41.403
From what?

1:01:43.385 --> 1:01:45.626
Those little trees over there
maybe?

1:01:47.675 --> 1:01:49.658
Am I in trouble, Officer?

1:01:49.753 --> 1:01:50.746
We will see.

1:01:59.322 --> 1:02:00.410
Come on, come on.

1:02:00.506 --> 1:02:01.722
One more time.

1:02:04.698 --> 1:02:06.041
Everything out.

1:02:06.138 --> 1:02:07.194
Take the skirt off.

1:02:19.033 --> 1:02:20.027
No!

1:02:21.210 --> 1:02:22.714
- What?!
- You doofus!

1:02:22.810 --> 1:02:24.219
The balloon skirt!

1:02:30.138 --> 1:02:31.227
Unbelievable!

1:04:00.665 --> 1:04:01.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:04:01.529 --> 1:04:02.874
Wait in the car.

1:04:22.426 --> 1:04:23.418
Kumar.

1:04:38.619 --> 1:04:39.897
Hi, Kumar.

1:04:39.993 --> 1:04:40.986
It's Sophia.

1:04:41.657 --> 1:04:43.802
I was just in your office.

1:04:45.945 --> 1:04:47.066
I know what today is.

1:04:50.905 --> 1:04:51.898
Forget I even asked.

1:04:55.098 --> 1:04:56.090
Liz!

1:04:59.035 --> 1:05:00.410
Stop right there!

1:05:02.810 --> 1:05:03.642
What are you doing?

1:05:03.738 --> 1:05:08.698
Oh!

1:05:12.025 --> 1:05:13.018
Shit.

1:05:17.465 --> 1:05:19.098
It's not over.

1:05:19.194 --> 1:05:22.394
Liz is gonna send help, I just
know it.

1:05:22.489 --> 1:05:24.218
How did we get here?

1:05:25.177 --> 1:05:27.193
It was just a bit of fun.

1:05:27.290 --> 1:05:29.306
I don't want to die.

1:05:29.401 --> 1:05:30.426
Then don't die!

1:05:33.946 --> 1:05:34.873
Oh, God.

1:05:39.898 --> 1:05:44.667
If this is really it, I'm not
going down without a fight!

1:05:46.586 --> 1:05:47.579
Dammit!

1:05:48.761 --> 1:05:50.682
Maybe all of this meant...

1:05:50.777 --> 1:05:52.441
Maybe it's karma.

1:05:52.537 --> 1:05:54.298
No! Karma, my ass!

1:05:55.162 --> 1:05:56.410
I'm a good person!

1:05:57.562 --> 1:05:58.554
Can I be honest?

1:06:00.154 --> 1:06:01.881
I gave your card to Jack.

1:06:01.978 --> 1:06:04.955
You were our last job, then
I would have got a future.

1:06:11.161 --> 1:06:13.593
You gave my card to your
boyfriend?

1:06:13.689 --> 1:06:16.505
He went in our room when Liz was
in there?

1:06:16.602 --> 1:06:20.923
You dropped it, but I
would have stolen it anyway.

1:06:22.202 --> 1:06:23.194
I'm a thief.

1:06:24.155 --> 1:06:25.115
Tasteless.

1:06:28.089 --> 1:06:29.082
Why?

1:06:31.225 --> 1:06:32.251
Why?

1:06:34.746 --> 1:06:35.770
Why?!

1:08:25.178 --> 1:08:26.490
Why are we stopped?

1:08:26.587 --> 1:08:28.026
Balloon's different.

1:08:31.450 --> 1:08:32.441
We're losing air.

1:08:36.858 --> 1:08:37.850
Dammit!

1:08:39.193 --> 1:08:39.962
Words.

1:08:40.057 --> 1:08:40.793
Sorry.

1:08:40.889 --> 1:08:41.881
We're sinking.

1:08:42.842 --> 1:08:45.562
- How?
- Oh, I need to plug the hole.

1:08:45.657 --> 1:08:46.841
There must be something.

1:08:48.281 --> 1:08:49.593
Well, ain't that just dandy?

1:08:49.690 --> 1:08:50.682
We're gonna sink.

1:09:02.842 --> 1:09:04.154
Can I have it?

1:09:05.369 --> 1:09:07.065
Who are you gonna call?

1:09:07.162 --> 1:09:08.154
Whoa!

1:09:11.833 --> 1:09:15.929
Way to go, amigo. My
life is on that thing!

1:09:16.025 --> 1:09:17.049
But we're alive.

1:09:19.001 --> 1:09:20.250
You won't be for long.

1:09:20.346 --> 1:09:21.371
Ha.

1:09:24.729 --> 1:09:25.945
Let's roll.

1:09:45.497 --> 1:09:46.523
Mira!

1:09:48.954 --> 1:09:50.458
Mira!

1:09:50.554 --> 1:09:51.545
Mira!

1:10:07.994 --> 1:10:08.889
I got you.

1:10:08.986 --> 1:10:10.362
Pull yourself up.

1:10:10.458 --> 1:10:11.706
Kick your legs.

1:10:19.737 --> 1:10:21.305
Put your head back.

1:10:22.777 --> 1:10:23.770
Kick.

1:10:38.297 --> 1:10:40.985
Making me an accomplice
won't lesson your sentence.

1:10:41.817 --> 1:10:42.714
I'm a kid.

1:10:42.810 --> 1:10:45.914
I will get immunity and a social
worker.

1:10:47.129 --> 1:10:48.441
You're a criminal.

1:10:48.538 --> 1:10:49.593
We're criminals.

1:10:49.690 --> 1:10:51.674
Fugitives on the run.

1:10:51.770 --> 1:10:53.146
We're not on the run.

1:10:53.242 --> 1:10:55.162
We're just in a hurry.

1:10:55.257 --> 1:10:58.137
Imagine the cop's face when he
sees Kate.

1:12:40.473 --> 1:12:41.626
How are we gonna get back?

1:12:41.722 --> 1:12:43.162
How are we gonna find Kate?

1:12:53.465 --> 1:12:54.458
Oh.

1:12:55.833 --> 1:12:57.914
Sophia.

1:12:58.009 --> 1:12:59.034
Here we are.

1:13:07.610 --> 1:13:10.553
Your sister's as stubborn as
you?

1:13:46.808 --> 1:13:48.121
How long do we do this?

1:13:48.217 --> 1:13:50.041
Until we find something.

1:13:50.136 --> 1:13:51.642
What if we don't?

1:13:51.737 --> 1:13:56.601
I'm not giving up, okay?

1:13:56.698 --> 1:14:01.561
Liz, you have to accept the
possibility that she's gone.

1:14:01.656 --> 1:14:03.417
I'm not giving up, okay?

1:14:03.514 --> 1:14:05.274
Not her. Not on me.

1:14:06.169 --> 1:14:07.418
That was an hour ago.

1:14:07.513 --> 1:14:08.632
They drifted.

1:14:08.729 --> 1:14:09.722
Row!

1:14:26.361 --> 1:14:28.313
I can't feel my legs.

1:14:29.210 --> 1:14:30.426
Keep kicking.

1:14:30.521 --> 1:14:31.929
You'll be warmer.

1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:42.329
A ship!

1:14:42.425 --> 1:14:43.288
Here!

1:14:43.386 --> 1:14:44.698
Over here!

1:14:44.793 --> 1:14:45.785
Hey!

1:14:49.784 --> 1:14:50.810
Hey!

1:15:01.944 --> 1:15:03.801
It's coming this way!

1:15:03.897 --> 1:15:04.922
We're saved!

1:15:17.273 --> 1:15:18.937
It's no good!

1:15:19.034 --> 1:15:20.282
They can't see!

1:15:22.202 --> 1:15:23.962
They're going to hit us!

1:15:24.057 --> 1:15:25.625
Move!

1:15:25.722 --> 1:15:26.714
Go! Come on!

1:16:58.233 --> 1:17:00.474
You love me, baby?

1:18:36.313 --> 1:18:37.753
She must be here.

1:18:38.809 --> 1:18:40.280
Where is she?

1:18:40.377 --> 1:18:42.842
Look, an air balloon's a big
thing.

1:18:42.938 --> 1:18:45.178
If it or Kate were here, we'd
find them.

1:18:48.504 --> 1:18:53.497
Kate!

1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:57.369
Kate, where are you?!

1:18:59.866 --> 1:19:01.242
Liz, I'm sorry.

1:19:03.608 --> 1:19:05.560
Kate!

1:19:05.656 --> 1:19:07.162
You can't leave me!

1:19:07.257 --> 1:19:10.681
Kate!

1:19:10.777 --> 1:19:11.769
Hey!

1:19:12.569 --> 1:19:13.881
Cannot see us!

1:19:13.977 --> 1:19:15.160
No.

1:19:15.257 --> 1:19:16.250
Too far.

1:19:17.017 --> 1:19:22.010
But we need a signal.

1:19:23.961 --> 1:19:25.434
Hey!

1:19:25.529 --> 1:19:26.233
Kate.

1:19:26.329 --> 1:19:28.185
Kate, we have the sun.

1:19:28.281 --> 1:19:30.777
- What?
- We have the sun!

1:19:30.872 --> 1:19:31.577
Okay.

1:19:31.673 --> 1:19:32.697
Yeah.

1:19:39.481 --> 1:19:41.016
- Hey!
- Hey!

1:19:41.113 --> 1:19:46.074
Kate!

1:19:48.313 --> 1:19:49.656
See that?

1:19:49.753 --> 1:19:50.489
It's Kate!

1:19:50.584 --> 1:19:54.008
Kate!

1:19:54.104 --> 1:19:55.129
Go, go.

1:19:55.225 --> 1:19:56.154
Go there.

1:19:56.249 --> 1:19:57.626
Quickly, quickly.

1:20:24.472 --> 1:20:26.200
Go. Quickly, quickly.

1:20:38.873 --> 1:20:39.865
Kate!

1:20:41.496 --> 1:20:42.585
Quickly.

1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:43.673
Kate!

1:20:54.904 --> 1:20:56.089
Get in here!

1:21:22.553 --> 1:21:25.498
Oh, this is Mira, my good
friend.

1:21:27.288 --> 1:21:29.946
This is Sophia, my new bestie.

1:21:31.321 --> 1:21:33.305
You, thank you.

1:21:39.130 --> 1:21:40.120
I love you.

1:21:41.977 --> 1:21:42.969
I love you.

1:21:47.608 --> 1:21:50.392
Guys, do you
know where we're going?

1:21:50.489 --> 1:21:52.345
Does anyone know we're out here?

1:21:53.688 --> 1:21:55.161
Anybody got a phone?
