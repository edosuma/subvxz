"It Was a Pleasure Sharing"
...by Synchronized, Enjoy!

01:13.898 --> 01:14.965
Hey!

02:59.604 --> 03:01.339
We live in a twilight world.

03:03.174 --> 03:05.320
We live in a twilight world.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.355
And there are
no friends at dusk.

03:07.445 --> 03:10.181
You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.

03:15.253 --> 03:16.964
But I established contact.

03:17.054 --> 03:18.732
Bring you in or kill you.

03:18.822 --> 03:21.092
I have two minutes. Make up your mind.

03:25.896 --> 03:27.242
Where's the package?

03:27.332 --> 03:28.466
Coat check.

03:52.923 --> 03:53.991
Stay.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.894
No friends
at dusk, huh?

04:21.985 --> 04:22.930
You'll do.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.522
Get him to the rally point.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.401
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

04:59.491 --> 05:01.236
I've never seen encapsulation
like this.

05:01.326 --> 05:03.638
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

05:03.728 --> 05:04.673
Did you have an out?

05:04.763 --> 05:06.541
Service tunnel to the sewer.

05:06.631 --> 05:09.943
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.379
Can you defuse that?

05:11.469 --> 05:12.781
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

05:12.871 --> 05:14.349
Covering their tracks.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.916
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

05:16.006 --> 05:16.785
That's not our mission.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.143
Mine now.

05:43.535 --> 05:44.536
Walk away.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.508
You don't have to
kill these people.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.232
That wasn't one of us.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.023
I'll take the help.

06:07.926 --> 06:09.127
Go, go, go.

06:39.657 --> 06:41.002
A man can be trained

06:41.092 --> 06:43.037
to hold out
for about 18 hours,

06:43.127 --> 06:46.264
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

06:52.303 --> 06:54.115
He didn't last 18 minutes.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.084
He didn't have anything
to hide.

06:56.174 --> 06:58.610
You were smuggling a nobody.

07:01.646 --> 07:03.381
It's risky.

07:06.451 --> 07:08.897
Or were you counting on this?

07:08.987 --> 07:10.398
Death.

07:10.488 --> 07:12.423
CIA issue.

07:19.464 --> 07:22.734
Spare yourself,
once they clear.

07:37.047 --> 07:39.093
Almost 7:00.

07:39.183 --> 07:40.552
Uh-oh.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.392
It's running fast.

07:51.129 --> 07:53.598
We have to put it back
one hour.

08:13.051 --> 08:14.586
Get it out!

08:38.275 --> 08:41.089
Welcome to the afterlife.

08:41.179 --> 08:43.457
You've been in a
medically-induced coma

08:43.548 --> 08:47.228
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.556
The suicide pills
are fake.

08:52.457 --> 08:53.735
Why?

08:53.825 --> 08:55.436
A test.

08:55.526 --> 08:56.661
A test?

08:59.931 --> 09:01.833
They pulled my teeth out.

09:03.267 --> 09:05.637
Did my team get clear?

09:06.471 --> 09:07.882
No.

09:07.972 --> 09:09.907
Private Russians, we think.

09:10.908 --> 09:12.844
Somebody talked.

09:13.878 --> 09:15.390
Not you.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.616
You chose to die instead of
giving up your colleagues.

09:27.458 --> 09:31.372
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

09:31.462 --> 09:35.743
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.201
You do.

09:43.074 --> 09:44.719
I resign.

09:44.809 --> 09:48.423
You don't work for us.
You're dead.

09:48.513 --> 09:51.392
Your duty transcends
national interests.

09:51.482 --> 09:53.484
This is about survival.

09:55.787 --> 09:56.888
Whose?

09:59.357 --> 10:00.825
Everyone's.

10:03.327 --> 10:06.507
There's a cold war,
cold as ice.

10:06.597 --> 10:10.244
To even know its true nature
is to lose.

10:10.334 --> 10:11.946
This is knowledge divided.

10:12.036 --> 10:15.583
All I have for you is a gesture

10:15.673 --> 10:18.053
in combination with a word.

10:18.143 --> 10:19.444
"Tenet."

10:21.113 --> 10:23.858
Use it carefully.

10:23.948 --> 10:27.228
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

10:27.318 --> 10:29.454
That's all they've told you?

10:30.455 --> 10:32.223
That test you passed?

10:33.858 --> 10:34.959
Not everybody does.

12:47.925 --> 12:52.673
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.465
Almost.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.567
An obscure tenet.

13:05.310 --> 13:06.654
No small talk.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.856
Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.

13:08.946 --> 13:11.692
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

13:11.782 --> 13:14.428
You're not here for "what,"
you're here for "how."

13:14.518 --> 13:17.665
"What" is your department
and not my business.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.967
Well, to do what I do...

13:20.057 --> 13:22.960
I need some idea
of the threat we face.

13:25.130 --> 13:28.976
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent World War III.

13:29.066 --> 13:30.801
Nuclear holocaust?

13:31.236 --> 13:32.470
No.

13:33.905 --> 13:35.539
Something worse.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.017
Aim it and pull the trigger.

13:48.086 --> 13:49.131
It's empty.

13:49.221 --> 13:50.222
Aim it.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.461
Check the magazine.

14:01.766 --> 14:02.934
How?

14:08.273 --> 14:12.587
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.389
The other one's
going backwards.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.848
Can you tell which is which?

14:19.550 --> 14:21.562
How about now?

14:21.652 --> 14:24.365
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

14:24.455 --> 14:27.302
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

14:27.392 --> 14:30.771
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

14:30.861 --> 14:31.839
You didn't make it?

14:31.929 --> 14:33.342
No, we don't know how yet.

14:33.432 --> 14:34.742
So, where'd it come from?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.179
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

14:37.269 --> 14:39.248
They're streaming back at us.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.671
Try it.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.680
You have to have dropped it.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.537
How can it move
before I touch it?

15:03.627 --> 15:05.973
From your point of view,
you caught it.

15:06.063 --> 15:08.442
But from the bullet's point of
view, you dropped it.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.178
But cause comes before effect.

15:10.268 --> 15:13.447
No, that's just the way
we see time.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.384
Well, what about free will?

15:15.474 --> 15:17.818
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

15:17.908 --> 15:21.012
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

15:22.247 --> 15:24.015
Don't try to understand it.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.617
Feel it.

15:37.028 --> 15:38.130
Instinct.

15:39.930 --> 15:41.032
Got it.

15:45.703 --> 15:47.905
Why does it feel so strange?

15:48.839 --> 15:51.219
You're not shooting the bullet,

15:51.309 --> 15:52.810
you're catching it.

15:54.346 --> 15:55.980
Whoa.

15:58.316 --> 16:00.461
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

16:00.551 --> 16:01.529
In the field?

16:01.619 --> 16:02.797
I was almost hit.

16:02.887 --> 16:05.200
Then you were
exceedingly lucky.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.337
An inverted bullet passing through
your body would be devastating.

16:08.427 --> 16:09.794
Not pretty.

16:11.363 --> 16:12.940
These look like today's.

16:13.030 --> 16:14.775
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

16:14.865 --> 16:16.811
Where did you get them?

16:16.901 --> 16:19.880
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.649
Do you have an analysis
on the metals?

16:21.739 --> 16:23.584
Sure. Why?

16:23.674 --> 16:26.188
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.778
Look...

16:28.913 --> 16:30.781
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

16:33.151 --> 16:35.796
The bullet may not seem like
much, but it's a simple machine.

16:35.886 --> 16:38.956
Lead bullet, brass casing,
gunpowder.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.269
If they can invert that,

16:41.359 --> 16:43.038
I see no reason they couldn't
invert pretty much anything.

16:43.128 --> 16:46.208
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

16:46.298 --> 16:50.135
An inverted weapon might be
able to affect our past as well.

16:53.572 --> 16:58.253
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

16:58.343 --> 17:01.179
Remnants of complex objects.

17:04.516 --> 17:06.016
What do you think we're seeing?

17:07.885 --> 17:10.387
The detritus of a coming war.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.386
- <i>Yep?</i>
- We live in a twilight world.

17:31.476 --> 17:33.788
<i>No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.</i>

17:33.878 --> 17:35.424
Even the dead need allies.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.092
<i>Specifically?</i>

17:37.182 --> 17:40.328
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

17:40.418 --> 17:41.929
<i>Singh?</i>

17:42.019 --> 17:43.697
<i>He never leaves his house.
And his house is...</i>

17:43.787 --> 17:44.832
- <i>his house.</i>
- Yes, it is.

17:44.922 --> 17:46.501
I'm looking right at it.

17:46.591 --> 17:48.336
<i>I'll see who's on deck.</i>

17:48.426 --> 17:50.428
<i>Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.</i>

18:02.706 --> 18:03.984
It seems you need
an introduction

18:04.074 --> 18:07.345
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.757
I'm Neil.

18:09.847 --> 18:11.882
I need an audience
with Sanjay Singh.

18:14.018 --> 18:15.297
That's not possible.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.300
Ten minutes tops.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.801
Time isn't the problem.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.195
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.411
Would you take a child hostage?
A woman?

18:29.501 --> 18:30.778
If I had to.

18:30.868 --> 18:32.780
I'm not looking to make much
noise here.

18:32.870 --> 18:33.848
Yes?

18:33.938 --> 18:36.974
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

18:39.277 --> 18:40.345
What?

18:41.213 --> 18:42.457
You never drink on the job.

18:42.547 --> 18:44.025
You're well-informed.

18:44.115 --> 18:47.795
Well, pays to be
in our profession.

18:47.885 --> 18:50.222
Well, I prefer soda water.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.891
No, you don't.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.737
How's your parachuting?

18:56.827 --> 18:58.573
I broke an ankle
during basic training.

18:58.663 --> 19:01.909
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.311
It's bungee-jumpable.

19:03.401 --> 19:05.646
I don't think "bungee-jumpable"
is a word.

19:05.736 --> 19:08.973
It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.

19:10.074 --> 19:12.143
Or into it, for that matter.

19:51.449 --> 19:54.119
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

20:56.781 --> 20:58.627
Stay back.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.795
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.832
I want to know who supplied it.

21:04.922 --> 21:06.668
My name is Sanjay.

21:06.758 --> 21:08.836
And you are?

21:08.926 --> 21:10.795
No chitchat?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.407
There's no one
at the other end.

21:12.497 --> 21:14.099
No one who's gonna
help you, anyway.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.901
Don't let it get cold.

21:19.771 --> 21:21.549
Why should I know
who supplied it?

21:21.639 --> 21:24.818
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

21:24.908 --> 21:25.953
If it's from India,
it's from you.

21:26.043 --> 21:27.821
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.491
Deduction, then.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.092
Look, my friend...

21:31.182 --> 21:34.129
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

21:34.219 --> 21:36.821
I'm not the man they send
to negotiate.

21:38.156 --> 21:40.001
Or the man they send
to make deals.

21:40.091 --> 21:43.228
But I am the man
people talk to.

21:44.895 --> 21:46.408
I can't.

21:46.498 --> 21:47.609
I can't tell you.

21:47.699 --> 21:49.210
You're an arms dealer, friend.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.912
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

21:52.002 --> 21:53.814
To say anything
about a client

21:53.904 --> 21:56.884
would violate the tenets
he lives by.

21:56.974 --> 22:00.145
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

22:00.845 --> 22:02.157
Everything.

22:02.247 --> 22:05.327
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

22:05.417 --> 22:08.962
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

22:09.052 --> 22:10.632
<i>Cheers.</i>

22:10.722 --> 22:12.767
- Priya.
- Hmm.

22:12.857 --> 22:14.736
This is your operation?

22:14.826 --> 22:18.139
A masculine front in
a man's world has its uses.

22:18.229 --> 22:20.575
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.

22:20.665 --> 22:21.810
The Russian oligarch.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.844
- You know him?
- Not personally.

22:23.934 --> 22:25.846
Made his billions in gas.

22:25.936 --> 22:29.617
Moved to London. Said to be on
the outs with Moscow.

22:29.707 --> 22:31.453
Very good.

22:31.543 --> 22:34.489
Except the gas he made his billions
from was actually plutonium.

22:34.579 --> 22:38.393
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.995
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

22:41.085 --> 22:43.431
So how did he
get them inverted?

22:43.521 --> 22:46.334
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

22:46.424 --> 22:48.626
Between our time
and the future.

22:50.027 --> 22:51.773
He can communicate
with the future?

22:51.863 --> 22:53.308
We all do, don't we?

22:53.398 --> 22:55.210
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

22:55.300 --> 22:59.247
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

22:59.337 --> 23:03.284
The question is,
can the future speak back?

23:03.374 --> 23:05.653
And I'm supposed to find out?

23:05.743 --> 23:09.923
To get anywhere near Sator would
take a fresh-faced protagonist.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.660
And you are fresh as a daisy.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.894
Get close.

23:13.984 --> 23:16.231
Find out what he's receiving
and how.

23:16.321 --> 23:18.266
Is it safe to involve
British Intelligence?

23:18.356 --> 23:20.991
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.267
You must've had a plan for
getting out.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.035
Not one I love.

23:54.993 --> 23:56.838
May I help you, sir?

23:56.928 --> 23:58.339
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

23:58.429 --> 24:01.109
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

24:01.199 --> 24:02.310
Presume away.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.168
If you'll follow me.

24:08.540 --> 24:11.109
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.111
I'll catch up.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.023
Same for me, please.

24:15.113 --> 24:16.191
I'll send the waiter.

24:16.281 --> 24:18.660
No, just pass on the order.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.563
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

24:21.653 --> 24:24.566
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.

24:24.656 --> 24:27.402
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

24:27.492 --> 24:30.738
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

24:30.828 --> 24:32.073
but they don't seem to care.

24:32.163 --> 24:33.775
Tell me about him.

24:33.865 --> 24:37.312
I assume you're familiar with
the Soviet-era secret cities.

24:37.402 --> 24:41.282
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

24:41.372 --> 24:44.886
Most of them have been opened
up and renamed as regular towns.

24:44.976 --> 24:46.754
Not the one Sator grew up in.

24:46.844 --> 24:48.356
Stalsk-12.

24:48.446 --> 24:51.226
In the '70s,
it had a population of about 200,000.

24:51.316 --> 24:52.627
Thought to be abandoned.

24:52.717 --> 24:54.395
Abandoned?

24:54.485 --> 24:57.866
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.668
Two weeks ago, same day as the
Kiev opera siege,

25:00.758 --> 25:04.038
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

25:04.128 --> 25:06.441
just where Stalsk-12 was.

25:06.531 --> 25:09.944
Sator emerged from
this blank spot on the map

25:10.034 --> 25:11.846
with ambition...

25:11.936 --> 25:15.083
and enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.

25:15.173 --> 25:16.618
Through his wife?

25:16.708 --> 25:19.254
Katherine Barton. Oldest niece
of Sir Frederick Barton.

25:19.344 --> 25:21.723
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.

25:21.813 --> 25:22.757
A happy marriage?

25:22.847 --> 25:24.926
Practically estranged.

25:25.016 --> 25:26.094
Well, how do I get to Sator?

25:26.184 --> 25:27.729
Well, through her, of course.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.388
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

25:30.922 --> 25:32.123
Hardly.

25:32.991 --> 25:35.193
We have an ace in the hole.

25:37.695 --> 25:40.275
You're carrying a Goya
in a Harrods bag.

25:40.365 --> 25:42.977
It's a fake by a Spaniard
named Arepo.

25:43.067 --> 25:46.314
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

25:46.404 --> 25:48.017
What happened to the other one?

25:48.107 --> 25:50.885
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

25:50.975 --> 25:52.287
Put on auction.

25:52.377 --> 25:54.023
And who do you think bought it?

25:54.113 --> 25:55.089
Her husband?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.414
Mmm-hmm.

25:57.615 --> 25:59.427
Does she know it's a forgery?

25:59.517 --> 26:00.728
Oh, it's hard to say.

26:00.818 --> 26:04.966
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.

26:05.056 --> 26:06.357
Uh-huh.

26:07.258 --> 26:09.170
Look, no offense,

26:09.260 --> 26:13.197
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

26:14.465 --> 26:16.611
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

26:16.701 --> 26:18.379
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

26:18.469 --> 26:21.205
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

26:21.906 --> 26:23.618
Can I recommend a tailor?

26:23.708 --> 26:24.986
I'll manage.

26:25.076 --> 26:27.188
You British don't have a
monopoly on snobbery, you know.

26:27.278 --> 26:28.523
Well, not a monopoly.

26:28.613 --> 26:30.782
More of a controlling interest.

26:32.117 --> 26:33.795
Could you box that up for me?

26:33.885 --> 26:34.986
Certainly not.

26:36.187 --> 26:38.256
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

27:10.855 --> 27:12.323
How can I help, sir?

27:15.460 --> 27:18.640
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

27:18.730 --> 27:19.731
Goya.

27:20.932 --> 27:22.377
Mr. Goya.

27:22.467 --> 27:24.702
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.706
That's extraordinary.

27:33.878 --> 27:35.379
What's it worth?

27:36.414 --> 27:38.316
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

27:39.584 --> 27:42.520
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

27:43.755 --> 27:47.535
Provenance, microscopic
examination, X-rays.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.894
But what does
your heart tell you?

27:53.898 --> 27:55.833
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

27:56.968 --> 27:58.035
Tomas Arepo.

28:01.405 --> 28:04.886
I bought my Goya for cents on a
dollar from an irate Swiss banker.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.855
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

28:07.945 --> 28:10.758
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

28:10.848 --> 28:13.227
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

28:13.317 --> 28:14.429
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

28:14.519 --> 28:16.230
My drawing's a very good fake.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.699
You know that
better than anyone.

28:17.789 --> 28:19.724
The information's the bargain.

28:21.193 --> 28:23.204
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

28:23.294 --> 28:26.541
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

28:26.631 --> 28:28.110
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

28:28.200 --> 28:29.477
Arrangement?

28:29.567 --> 28:31.080
You mean blackmail.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.447
Don't be afraid of the word.

28:32.537 --> 28:34.582
My husband isn't.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.451
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.486
He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?

28:38.576 --> 28:39.687
Why would he?

28:39.777 --> 28:41.355
He paid $9 million for it.

28:41.445 --> 28:43.925
Barely cover the cost of the
holiday he just forced us on.

28:44.015 --> 28:45.583
Where'd you go, Mars?

28:46.651 --> 28:50.364
Vietnam, on our yacht.
His yacht.

28:50.454 --> 28:53.801
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

28:53.891 --> 28:56.604
Think you're a little
out of your depth.

28:56.694 --> 28:59.874
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

28:59.964 --> 29:03.835
generally aren't okay with
being cheated out of any of it.

29:09.241 --> 29:11.709
The drawing is his hold
over me.

29:15.646 --> 29:20.852
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

29:22.987 --> 29:24.732
He controls me.

29:24.822 --> 29:27.468
My contact with my son.
Everything.

29:27.558 --> 29:31.129
Leaving would never have been
easy but now it's impossible.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.565
You can't fight.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.102
Just beg.

29:39.104 --> 29:41.216
In Vietnam,
I tried to love him again.

29:41.306 --> 29:44.685
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

29:44.775 --> 29:48.923
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

29:49.013 --> 29:51.425
<i>imitating some earlier time
in our lives.</i>

29:51.515 --> 29:54.462
He seemed happy,
so I asked him.

29:54.552 --> 29:56.564
<i>And he made me an offer.</i>

29:56.654 --> 29:59.523
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

30:03.027 --> 30:06.340
I expressed myself.
I took Max ashore.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.144
He called us, contrite.

30:09.234 --> 30:10.778
And when we got back,

30:10.868 --> 30:12.181
<i>I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,</i>

30:12.271 --> 30:13.804
and he'd vanished.

30:16.707 --> 30:18.586
I never felt such envy.

30:18.676 --> 30:20.155
You don't seem
the jealous type.

30:20.245 --> 30:21.846
Of her freedom.

30:25.150 --> 30:28.197
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

30:28.287 --> 30:29.720
But you share a son.

30:30.389 --> 30:32.800
That's my life now.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.902
Did you know the drawing
was a fake?

30:34.992 --> 30:35.970
No.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.506
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.

30:38.596 --> 30:39.907
I failed.

30:39.997 --> 30:42.443
Andrei can't conceive of
failure, only betrayal.

30:42.533 --> 30:44.112
But I didn't betray my husband.

30:44.202 --> 30:46.781
Retrospect, maybe I missed
my chance.

30:46.871 --> 30:48.649
And he let Arepo walk free.

30:48.739 --> 30:50.751
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,

30:50.841 --> 30:53.487
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

30:53.577 --> 30:54.722
We spoke on the phone.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.958
He can't do that either.

30:57.048 --> 30:59.127
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

30:59.217 --> 31:00.661
Get me an introduction.

31:00.751 --> 31:02.363
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

31:02.453 --> 31:05.800
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

31:05.890 --> 31:08.103
I might just be
your second chance.

31:08.193 --> 31:10.038
No, I don't need redemption.

31:10.128 --> 31:11.595
At betrayal.

31:17.468 --> 31:18.669
Friends of your husband's?

31:19.670 --> 31:21.049
You knew this was
going to happen?

31:21.139 --> 31:23.352
Don't worry,
they won't kill you.

31:23.442 --> 31:26.687
Andrei dislikes tangling with local
law enforcement on that level.

31:26.777 --> 31:29.124
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

31:29.214 --> 31:31.126
The look of you's fine.

31:31.216 --> 31:34.428
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.064
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

31:36.154 --> 31:37.588
Don't call from home.

31:38.956 --> 31:40.858
You won't be taking my call.

31:42.626 --> 31:45.330
I might surprise you.

32:15.227 --> 32:17.862
I ordered my hot sauce
an hour ago.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.966
Can we get going?

32:35.579 --> 32:37.326
Please?

32:37.416 --> 32:38.816
He wants you to see.

33:04.742 --> 33:07.112
And he gets what he wants.

33:13.552 --> 33:15.753
Not always, apparently.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.405
<i>Anna says we're going
to Pompeii</i>

33:23.495 --> 33:24.638
and see lava.

33:24.728 --> 33:26.807
We will.
We'll go together.

33:26.897 --> 33:28.799
I'll be there, too!

33:48.487 --> 33:50.054
Told you I'd surprise you.

33:51.622 --> 33:52.700
He's a cute kid.

33:52.790 --> 33:53.991
He's everything.

33:56.361 --> 33:57.905
Where's the drawing?

33:57.995 --> 34:00.108
Oslo. At the airport.

34:00.198 --> 34:01.575
The airport?

34:01.665 --> 34:03.911
Do you know what a Freeport is?

34:04.001 --> 34:06.515
<i>A storage facility
for art that was acquired...</i>

34:06.605 --> 34:08.681
<i>But not yet taxed.</i>

34:08.772 --> 34:10.885
<i>We started a network.</i>

34:10.975 --> 34:14.554
<i>Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.</i>

34:14.645 --> 34:16.724
<i>The facilities are tax havens.</i>

34:16.813 --> 34:19.261
<i>The clients can view their
investments without importing them,</i>

34:19.351 --> 34:21.594
so they avoid paying tax.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.032
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

34:24.121 --> 34:25.666
<i>Art, antiquities.</i>

34:25.755 --> 34:27.668
- <i>Anything of value, really.</i>
- <i>Anything?</i>

34:27.757 --> 34:29.304
Anything legal.

34:29.393 --> 34:31.540
But it's not unlike
the Swiss banking system.

34:31.630 --> 34:34.342
Opaque.

34:34.431 --> 34:38.045
As I'm sure you are aware,
most Freeports are just warehouses.

34:38.136 --> 34:40.714
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

34:40.804 --> 34:43.418
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

34:43.507 --> 34:45.554
And this way to the vaults!

34:45.643 --> 34:47.289
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

34:47.379 --> 34:49.723
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

34:49.813 --> 34:52.260
- To view art?
- And whatever it is he does.

34:52.350 --> 34:54.762
Turns out art's
of no importance to Andrei.

34:54.851 --> 34:56.687
But the Freeports are.

34:58.022 --> 35:00.168
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

35:00.258 --> 35:03.071
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

35:03.161 --> 35:05.930
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

35:17.309 --> 35:21.845
Some of our clients opt for
biometric access, straight in...

35:23.248 --> 35:24.658
off the tarmac.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.016
From the terminal?

35:26.850 --> 35:28.796
From their private planes.

35:28.886 --> 35:30.931
Of course.

35:31.021 --> 35:33.701
Our logistics department
ships to and from

35:33.791 --> 35:34.902
any other Freeport in the world

35:34.992 --> 35:37.005
without customs inspection.

35:37.095 --> 35:38.906
<i>What are you hoping
to find in there?</i>

35:38.996 --> 35:40.075
You really wanna know?

35:40.165 --> 35:42.010
I'm not sure.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.446
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

35:44.536 --> 35:45.913
Jesus.

35:46.003 --> 35:47.382
It's nuclear.

35:47.472 --> 35:49.317
When you're on the tour,

35:49.407 --> 35:51.942
<i>pay attention
to the fire precautions.</i>

35:53.245 --> 35:54.322
Documents are
vulnerable to...

35:54.412 --> 35:55.923
Fire? Absolutely!

35:56.013 --> 35:58.026
No, I was going to say water
damage from the sprinkler systems.

35:58.116 --> 36:00.195
We don't use sprinklers.

36:00.285 --> 36:03.031
The facility is flooded
with halide gas,

36:03.121 --> 36:05.290
displacing all the air
within seconds.

36:06.558 --> 36:07.602
Can you show me?

36:07.692 --> 36:09.760
If I did, we'd suffocate.

36:10.928 --> 36:12.107
What about the staff?

36:12.197 --> 36:13.807
Halide only fills the vaults,

36:13.897 --> 36:15.709
they just have to get
into either corridor,

36:15.799 --> 36:17.778
and there is
a 10-second warning.

36:17.868 --> 36:19.780
At least you give them
10 seconds.

36:19.870 --> 36:24.653
Well, sir, our clients
use us because we have no priorities

36:24.743 --> 36:26.388
above their property.

36:26.478 --> 36:27.322
Blimey.

36:27.412 --> 36:28.657
All doors are fireproof.

36:28.747 --> 36:31.792
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

36:31.882 --> 36:33.694
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

36:33.784 --> 36:35.230
Why a lockdown?

36:35.320 --> 36:37.999
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

36:38.089 --> 36:40.958
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.004
And pickable locks.

36:43.094 --> 36:44.439
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

36:44.529 --> 36:45.607
Child's play?

36:45.697 --> 36:47.175
They're inside
airport security.

36:47.265 --> 36:49.810
They have to worry about climate
control, not armed raids.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.880
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

36:52.970 --> 36:54.838
to trigger
the lockdown procedure?

36:56.274 --> 36:57.952
Back wall of the Freeport.

36:58.042 --> 36:59.344
You've got something?

37:00.078 --> 37:02.424
Not gonna like it.

37:02.514 --> 37:04.226
You wanna crash a plane?

37:04.316 --> 37:06.760
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.331
I want to run a jet
off the taxiway

37:09.421 --> 37:12.056
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

37:13.792 --> 37:15.970
Well, how big a plane?

37:16.060 --> 37:20.131
Well, that part
is a little dramatic.

37:20.765 --> 37:22.910
This is Mahir.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.079
His team'll work the plane.

37:24.169 --> 37:25.513
There can't be passengers.

37:25.603 --> 37:27.082
Norsk Freight.

37:27.172 --> 37:29.417
They use the hangar on
the west side of the Freeport.

37:29.507 --> 37:31.885
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

37:31.975 --> 37:33.655
We pop the slides,
chuck 'em off.

37:33.745 --> 37:34.990
On the move?

37:35.080 --> 37:36.880
What's the problem?
They'll be fine.

37:37.749 --> 37:39.327
Well, it seems bold.

37:39.417 --> 37:42.197
Bold I'm fine with. I thought
you were gonna say nuts.

37:42.287 --> 37:43.531
And if you
get caught?

37:43.621 --> 37:44.566
We won't.

37:44.656 --> 37:46.401
And if you do?

37:46.491 --> 37:48.603
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

37:48.693 --> 37:51.872
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

37:51.962 --> 37:53.575
It'll barely make the news.

37:53.665 --> 37:56.144
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.647
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

37:58.737 --> 38:00.115
Gold bars?

38:00.205 --> 38:02.083
Norsk Freight ships Treasury
gold once a month.

38:02.173 --> 38:05.520
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

38:05.610 --> 38:09.314
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

38:11.982 --> 38:14.462
The space in the
center of the pentagon is too big.

38:14.552 --> 38:16.231
There's something there.

38:16.321 --> 38:19.357
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

38:20.725 --> 38:21.935
That's 45 seconds.

38:22.025 --> 38:23.071
Ample.

38:23.161 --> 38:24.529
Won't you be running?

38:26.197 --> 38:27.575
All right, it's your turn.

38:27.665 --> 38:28.966
Start packing.

38:46.818 --> 38:48.051
Gentlemen, if you
would, through the detector, please.

38:52.090 --> 38:53.368
Sir?

38:53.458 --> 38:54.803
Oh.

38:54.893 --> 38:56.026
And, sir.

39:04.502 --> 39:06.980
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

39:07.070 --> 39:08.717
No,
I'll take an espresso.

39:08.807 --> 39:10.585
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

39:10.675 --> 39:12.310
Excellent.

39:21.119 --> 39:22.997
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

39:23.087 --> 39:25.290
Because all I got here
is vegetarian.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.471
So that looks like meat,

39:29.561 --> 39:32.140
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.566
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

39:35.433 --> 39:36.301
Okay.

39:43.608 --> 39:45.042
This way, gentlemen.

40:00.758 --> 40:03.194
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.107
Carry on. Not the radio.

40:22.747 --> 40:24.115
Let's go.

40:39.998 --> 40:41.766
Uh...

40:54.445 --> 40:55.446
Yoga.

41:00.318 --> 41:02.420
Let's go! Now!

41:32.884 --> 41:33.851
Go, go, go!

42:09.320 --> 42:11.656
Right. Um...

42:25.770 --> 42:27.505
You said 10 seconds, right?

43:48.586 --> 43:50.421
There's
someone in here with us.

44:05.170 --> 44:07.405
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

44:35.466 --> 44:36.667
Don't touch them!

44:37.401 --> 44:38.836
The hell happened here?

44:44.342 --> 44:46.344
It hasn't happened yet.

47:05.384 --> 47:07.129
Don't kill him!

47:07.219 --> 47:09.820
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

47:11.956 --> 47:14.002
Why are you here?

47:14.092 --> 47:16.171
Who are you?

47:16.261 --> 47:18.163
How'd you know we'd be here?

47:33.577 --> 47:35.479
We need to go.

47:40.419 --> 47:42.830
What happened to the other guy?

47:42.920 --> 47:45.190
Took care of him.

47:59.704 --> 48:01.382
Well,
I've seen too much.

48:01.472 --> 48:04.086
I'm still alive, which must
mean you've decided to trust me.

48:04.176 --> 48:05.786
Or maybe I lost my edge.

48:05.876 --> 48:07.878
Edge is still intact.

48:09.613 --> 48:11.515
There's a cold war.

48:11.916 --> 48:13.095
Nuclear?

48:13.185 --> 48:14.419
Temporal.

48:15.686 --> 48:16.864
Time travel?

48:16.954 --> 48:18.133
No.

48:18.223 --> 48:21.159
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

48:22.260 --> 48:24.039
You mean reverse chronology.

48:24.129 --> 48:26.375
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

48:26.465 --> 48:27.675
moving backwards in time?

48:27.765 --> 48:29.443
Sure, that's exactly
what I meant.

48:29.533 --> 48:31.113
I have a master's in physics.

48:31.203 --> 48:32.513
Well, try and keep up.

48:32.603 --> 48:34.216
The implications of this are...

48:34.306 --> 48:35.317
Beyond secret.

48:35.407 --> 48:37.019
Then why'd you bring me in?

48:37.109 --> 48:39.487
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

48:39.577 --> 48:41.123
Not as surprised as I was.

48:41.213 --> 48:45.027
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

48:45.117 --> 48:48.652
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

48:49.587 --> 48:51.966
it's all about plutonium.

48:52.056 --> 48:53.567
And when we're done,
they'll kill you.

48:53.657 --> 48:56.504
Won't you have to
do that anyway?

48:56.594 --> 48:58.340
I'd rather it be my decision.

48:58.430 --> 48:59.297
So would I.

49:00.198 --> 49:01.266
I think.

49:13.311 --> 49:14.179
Your work?

49:16.680 --> 49:18.526
What did you find
in the vaults?

49:18.616 --> 49:21.396
Two antagonists. One inverted.

49:21.486 --> 49:25.499
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

49:25.589 --> 49:27.102
Both emerged
at the same moment?

49:27.192 --> 49:28.669
Yeah.

49:28.759 --> 49:30.061
They were the same person.

49:31.329 --> 49:33.442
Sator's built a turnstile
in that vault.

49:33.532 --> 49:34.775
Turnstile?

49:34.865 --> 49:37.212
A machine for inverting.

49:37.302 --> 49:40.248
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

49:40.338 --> 49:41.482
It hasn't.

49:41.572 --> 49:42.850
He's been given it
by the future.

49:42.940 --> 49:44.319
For what?

49:44.409 --> 49:46.944
You have the best chance of
finding out.

49:48.513 --> 49:49.857
- <i>Have you met him?</i>
- <i>I was close.</i>

49:49.947 --> 49:52.294
What if you have
something he needs?

49:52.384 --> 49:53.728
Such as?

49:53.818 --> 49:55.963
Plutonium-241.

49:56.053 --> 49:59.334
Sator tried to lift the only
loose 241 from under a CIA team

49:59.424 --> 50:01.969
at the opera siege in Kiev.

50:02.059 --> 50:03.405
He got the team.

50:03.495 --> 50:04.572
Not the 241.

50:04.662 --> 50:05.606
Who did?

50:05.696 --> 50:07.875
Ukrainian Security Services.

50:07.965 --> 50:10.212
It's moving to Tallinn
in a week.

50:10.302 --> 50:13.348
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

50:13.438 --> 50:15.883
is unacceptable, Priya.

50:15.973 --> 50:17.452
I'm just gonna take him out.

50:17.542 --> 50:19.587
No, no, no.
Sator has to stay alive.

50:19.677 --> 50:22.623
He has to stay alive until
we know his part in things.

50:22.713 --> 50:24.092
Leverage the situation,

50:24.182 --> 50:26.428
without losing control
of the 241.

50:26.518 --> 50:28.063
It's too dangerous.

50:28.153 --> 50:30.298
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

50:30.388 --> 50:33.335
is nothing compared with what will
happen if we don't stop Sator.

50:33.425 --> 50:34.935
From doing what?

50:35.025 --> 50:38.929
We are being attacked
by the future.

50:40.098 --> 50:43.168
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

50:58.983 --> 51:01.263
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

51:01.353 --> 51:03.331
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

51:03.421 --> 51:05.300
You destroyed it?

51:05.390 --> 51:07.469
I didn't think
you'd want it back.

51:07.559 --> 51:08.569
Does he know?

51:08.659 --> 51:10.238
Not yet. So sit tight.

51:10.328 --> 51:12.074
Sit tight?

51:12.164 --> 51:14.209
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

51:14.299 --> 51:15.377
It won't be long.

51:15.467 --> 51:18.103
In the meantime, introduce me.

51:18.603 --> 51:20.348
As what?

51:20.438 --> 51:22.484
I'm a former first secretary from
the American Embassy in Riyadh.

51:22.574 --> 51:24.319
We met at a party last June.

51:24.409 --> 51:25.986
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

51:26.076 --> 51:28.390
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.259
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

51:31.349 --> 51:33.161
Sator left early.
That's when we met.

51:33.251 --> 51:34.829
I came into Shipley's
in London.

51:34.919 --> 51:36.565
You ran into me here

51:36.655 --> 51:38.166
and wanna show me your yacht.

51:38.256 --> 51:40.601
He'll think we're
having an affair.

51:40.691 --> 51:41.735
Then he'll wanna meet me.

51:41.825 --> 51:42.837
Or have you killed.

51:42.927 --> 51:45.373
Let me worry about that.

51:45.463 --> 51:47.064
Did I look worried?

51:48.633 --> 51:49.877
Sleeps 70 with crew.

51:49.967 --> 51:52.613
Two helicopters.
Missile defenses.

51:52.703 --> 51:54.149
Afraid of pirates?

51:54.239 --> 51:56.750
Andrei lives playing
one government off the other.

51:56.840 --> 51:58.587
The day they turn,
that's his refuge.

51:58.677 --> 51:59.954
May I join you?

52:00.044 --> 52:02.524
Not sure Volkov's taking
passengers just now.

52:02.614 --> 52:04.349
Then we'll take mine.

52:38.316 --> 52:39.317
Max!

52:40.884 --> 52:43.088
Who's the American?

52:44.389 --> 52:45.733
He's a friend.

52:45.823 --> 52:48.637
The man from Shipley's.

52:48.727 --> 52:51.129
Who you tried to have
beaten up.

52:52.029 --> 52:54.532
I ask again, who is he?

52:57.102 --> 52:59.747
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

52:59.837 --> 53:02.217
Good with fists for a diplomat.

53:02.307 --> 53:04.352
Paranoia's your department,
Andrei.

53:04.442 --> 53:07.788
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

53:07.878 --> 53:09.057
Max?

53:09.147 --> 53:12.427
He's visiting Pompeii
and Herculaneum.

53:12.517 --> 53:14.029
You just sent him off?

53:14.119 --> 53:16.730
I promised him I'd go with him.

53:16.820 --> 53:19.023
I explained you were busy.

53:20.492 --> 53:22.926
With your friend.

53:43.847 --> 53:45.793
Hey, easy, fella.

53:45.883 --> 53:48.253
Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.

53:58.530 --> 54:01.266
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.170
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

54:05.637 --> 54:07.372
Uh... No.

54:08.373 --> 54:09.374
Not yet.

54:10.675 --> 54:12.477
How would you like to die?

54:13.244 --> 54:14.089
Old.

54:14.179 --> 54:16.914
You chose the wrong profession.

54:18.416 --> 54:20.328
There's a walled garden
up the road.

54:20.418 --> 54:22.863
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

54:22.953 --> 54:26.134
Not across. In the middle,
like a hole.

54:26.224 --> 54:28.969
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

54:29.059 --> 54:30.628
block the windpipe.

54:31.296 --> 54:32.540
Complex.

54:32.630 --> 54:34.942
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

54:35.032 --> 54:39.114
try to pull his own balls out
of his throat before he chokes.

54:39.204 --> 54:40.814
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

54:40.904 --> 54:42.474
We're finished.

54:46.511 --> 54:47.512
Do you like opera?

54:54.419 --> 54:55.530
Well?

54:55.620 --> 54:56.987
Not here.

55:00.392 --> 55:01.136
You sail?

55:01.226 --> 55:02.737
I've messed around on boats.

55:02.827 --> 55:05.630
Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to
do more than mess around.

55:06.264 --> 55:07.265
8:00 a.m.

55:21.579 --> 55:24.025
<i>Max has missed
too much school this year.</i>

55:24.115 --> 55:25.727
I'm taking him back to England.

55:25.817 --> 55:27.062
The school won't be okay with
him missing so much of the term.

55:27.152 --> 55:29.998
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

55:30.088 --> 55:31.865
You have all the trappings
of a king.

55:31.955 --> 55:34.502
We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games

55:34.592 --> 55:36.628
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

55:37.829 --> 55:39.364
You seem...

55:40.465 --> 55:42.300
spirited today.

55:43.835 --> 55:46.337
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

55:52.343 --> 55:54.689
Were you worried
it had been destroyed?

55:54.779 --> 55:59.094
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

55:59.184 --> 56:01.719
I've always had instincts
about the future.

56:03.321 --> 56:06.558
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

56:21.706 --> 56:23.441
Sailing or diving?

56:40.592 --> 56:42.093
Rising!

57:06.417 --> 57:09.030
What do you know about opera?

57:09.120 --> 57:12.200
In 2008, a remote
Russian missile station

57:12.290 --> 57:15.003
was overwhelmed
and held for a week.

57:15.093 --> 57:16.738
When the station was retaken,

57:16.828 --> 57:20.765
241 on one warhead was three
quarters of a kilo lighter.

57:24.836 --> 57:26.681
The missing 241

57:26.771 --> 57:29.950
surfaced at the opera house
siege in Kiev on the 14th.

57:30.040 --> 57:32.042
Coming about!

57:49.894 --> 57:52.263
What do you propose?

57:53.031 --> 57:54.008
Partnership.

57:54.098 --> 57:55.944
I wouldn't partner with you.

57:56.034 --> 58:00.281
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

58:00.371 --> 58:02.484
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

58:02.574 --> 58:04.285
who knows how to
cover his tracks.

58:04.375 --> 58:05.687
Not that shocking.

58:05.777 --> 58:08.022
For an intelligence agent.

58:08.112 --> 58:10.148
Right!

58:12.850 --> 58:14.285
Burn in hell, Andrei.

58:21.492 --> 58:23.304
You can't jibe
a boat like this!

58:23.394 --> 58:24.796
You can if you have to.

58:52.490 --> 58:54.536
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

58:54.626 --> 58:56.104
I need him.

58:56.194 --> 58:57.272
What, to sell guns?

58:57.362 --> 58:58.606
I'm not who you think I am.

58:58.696 --> 58:59.807
Well, that I know.

58:59.897 --> 59:02.410
He showed me the drawing.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.846
I'm sorry.
I had to get close to him.

59:04.936 --> 59:07.016
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

59:07.106 --> 59:09.751
Oh, we both know
he's an arms dealer.

59:09.841 --> 59:11.219
He's so much more.

59:11.309 --> 59:13.121
What, then?

59:13.211 --> 59:16.347
Andrei Sator holds all of our
lives in his hands, not just yours.

59:24.288 --> 59:25.967
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

59:26.057 --> 59:26.924
Okay.

59:27.692 --> 59:29.504
Now.

59:29.594 --> 59:31.796
Uh, he wants to see me
without pants?

59:37.869 --> 59:39.480
- Trust me.
- Save it.

59:39.570 --> 59:41.839
I'm not falling for it twice.

59:44.042 --> 59:45.510
You have a better option?

59:48.312 --> 59:50.258
Whatever it takes
to get what you want.

59:50.348 --> 59:52.950
Not a second's thought
for me or my son.

59:57.455 --> 59:59.757
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:12.770
Try not to use it.

01:00:14.772 --> 01:00:16.641
On anyone.

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:23.281
Enough.

01:00:26.684 --> 01:00:29.721
See? Pulse of a man
half my age.

01:00:32.924 --> 01:00:34.625
Drink with me.

01:00:36.461 --> 01:00:38.873
It seems I now owe you my life.

01:00:38.963 --> 01:00:40.009
It's nothing.

01:00:40.099 --> 01:00:42.111
My life is not nothing.

01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:44.812
And I don't like to be in debt.

01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:46.581
Then pay me.

01:00:46.671 --> 01:00:48.906
No retribution
against your wife.

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:54.612
You think she released
my harness?

01:00:57.982 --> 01:01:00.261
It was my own mistake.

01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:02.330
Then help me steal the 241.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.666
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

01:01:04.756 --> 01:01:06.801
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:08.426
I know what it means.

01:01:10.495 --> 01:01:13.698
You lecture me about radiation?

01:01:14.499 --> 01:01:16.310
Andrei Sator,

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.249
digging plutonium from the
rubble of my city as a teenager.

01:01:21.339 --> 01:01:22.406
Where?

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:26.978
<i>Stalsk-12.</i>

01:01:28.379 --> 01:01:29.580
<i>My home.</i>

01:01:32.316 --> 01:01:36.854
One part of a warhead exploded at
ground level, scattering the others.

01:01:38.489 --> 01:01:41.292
They needed people
to find the plutonium.

01:01:43.228 --> 01:01:45.174
It became my first contract.

01:01:45.264 --> 01:01:48.566
<i>Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.</i>

01:01:51.402 --> 01:01:52.603
But...

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:57.074
<i>one man's probability
of death...</i>

01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:03.347
...is another man's possibility
for a life.

01:02:05.783 --> 01:02:08.896
<i>I staked my claim
in the new Russia.</i>

01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:13.768
Even now, my company is the only
one to operate in the ruins.

01:02:13.858 --> 01:02:16.904
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

01:02:16.994 --> 01:02:22.410
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.869
I'm told you have resources
in Tallinn.

01:02:29.574 --> 01:02:31.953
Stay with us tonight.

01:02:32.043 --> 01:02:33.744
I insist.

01:03:01.106 --> 01:03:02.251
What do you want?

01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:04.542
We're going to talk
about today.

01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:06.354
No, we're not.

01:03:06.444 --> 01:03:07.645
No?

01:03:09.447 --> 01:03:10.825
We'll see.

01:03:10.915 --> 01:03:12.527
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

01:03:12.617 --> 01:03:14.685
like you treat
your other women.

01:03:16.554 --> 01:03:18.689
And, uh...

01:03:19.557 --> 01:03:22.436
how do you imagine...

01:03:22.526 --> 01:03:23.938
I treat these other women, huh?

01:03:24.028 --> 01:03:26.641
You think I force them
into conversation?

01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:28.277
You wanna be quiet, fine.

01:03:28.367 --> 01:03:30.067
You can bite down on that.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:36.707
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

01:03:37.942 --> 01:03:40.222
Is fear and pain
enough, Andrei?

01:03:40.312 --> 01:03:41.522
That's all I have to offer you.

01:03:41.612 --> 01:03:43.258
Well, that will
have to do, then.

01:03:43.348 --> 01:03:46.094
Why didn't you just let me go?

01:03:46.184 --> 01:03:48.186
Because...

01:03:50.188 --> 01:03:54.892
if I can't have you...

01:03:56.361 --> 01:03:59.974
no one else can.

01:04:00.064 --> 01:04:02.910
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.879
You think I let him interfere?

01:04:04.969 --> 01:04:07.815
If he tried,
you'd have to kill him.

01:04:07.905 --> 01:04:08.940
End of deal.

01:04:10.508 --> 01:04:12.910
So you leave me alone.

01:04:14.445 --> 01:04:16.447
Not now!

01:06:36.053 --> 01:06:40.325
Ninety-eight.
Not bad for such exertion.

01:06:50.968 --> 01:06:53.105
He was at the window.

01:06:54.738 --> 01:06:56.108
I was curious.

01:06:57.209 --> 01:07:00.355
My property
shouldn't concern you.

01:07:00.445 --> 01:07:01.956
Who are you?

01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:04.026
How do you come by your
information about the opera?

01:07:04.116 --> 01:07:08.497
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

01:07:08.587 --> 01:07:12.034
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

01:07:12.124 --> 01:07:15.669
They're usually buying,
not selling.

01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:18.473
But we do live
in a twilight world.

01:07:18.563 --> 01:07:20.075
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

01:07:20.165 --> 01:07:22.134
Next warning's a bullet
in the brain.

01:07:24.536 --> 01:07:26.781
No balls in my throat?

01:07:26.871 --> 01:07:29.451
There will be no time
for such things...

01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:31.019
in Tallinn.

01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:35.057
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

01:07:35.147 --> 01:07:36.348
No.

01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:42.830
I spring the material.
You pay me off.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.632
Your wife does the exchange.

01:07:44.722 --> 01:07:45.966
I never involve her
in my business.

01:07:46.056 --> 01:07:48.270
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.072
Put him ashore.

01:07:50.162 --> 01:07:51.540
How do I
contact you?

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.773
You don't.

01:07:52.863 --> 01:07:54.366
How do you advance me
the funds?

01:07:58.068 --> 01:08:01.273
Handle the plutonium
better than that.

01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:12.693
<i>What did you find on the gold?</i>

01:08:12.783 --> 01:08:14.595
<i>No franks,
no mold marks. Nothing.</i>

01:08:14.685 --> 01:08:16.997
- How?
- Dead drops.

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:20.135
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:23.770
then digs it up to collect the
inverted materials they sent.

01:08:23.861 --> 01:08:26.774
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

01:08:26.863 --> 01:08:29.877
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

01:08:29.966 --> 01:08:32.013
What did the soil samples show?

01:08:32.103 --> 01:08:34.416
Northern Europe, Asia.

01:08:34.506 --> 01:08:35.950
<i>Radioactive.</i>

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.876
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:40.921
Why am I here?

01:08:41.011 --> 01:08:44.392
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

01:08:44.482 --> 01:08:47.129
<i>Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?</i>

01:08:47.219 --> 01:08:50.064
Crowded. Unpredictable
traffic patterns.

01:08:50.154 --> 01:08:52.466
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

01:08:52.557 --> 01:08:54.734
They have a point.

01:08:54.825 --> 01:08:56.304
Is the convoy monitored
from the air?

01:08:56.394 --> 01:09:00.041
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
in come the cavalry.

01:09:00.131 --> 01:09:01.408
<i>We need big guns.</i>

01:09:01.499 --> 01:09:03.702
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:07.314
We need a fast car that doesn't
look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:08.948
All different.

01:09:09.038 --> 01:09:11.986
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

01:09:12.076 --> 01:09:15.357
Most of all, we have to set this
up with nothing in the record.

01:09:15.447 --> 01:09:17.392
Nothing electronic,
nothing paper.

01:09:17.482 --> 01:09:21.828
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

01:09:21.919 --> 01:09:24.955
His ignorance is our only
protection.

01:10:02.093 --> 01:10:03.495
You see, Kat?

01:10:04.462 --> 01:10:06.864
Some of my favorites.

01:10:08.099 --> 01:10:12.813
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

01:10:12.903 --> 01:10:15.550
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.987
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

01:10:20.077 --> 01:10:22.691
But this is where
our worlds collide.

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:24.292
What is this, Andrei?

01:10:24.382 --> 01:10:27.585
You know perfectly well
what it is, Kat.

01:10:30.422 --> 01:10:32.200
The filthy business

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:35.570
that put those clothes on your
back and our boy in his school,

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.196
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

01:10:47.971 --> 01:10:49.251
Time to go.

01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:50.851
I'm not going anywhere
with him.

01:10:50.941 --> 01:10:52.076
Look at me!

01:10:53.611 --> 01:10:55.789
And understand,

01:10:55.879 --> 01:10:58.360
you don't negotiate
with a tiger.

01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:02.497
You admire a tiger
until he turns on you

01:11:02.587 --> 01:11:06.957
and you feel its true
fucking nature!

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:08.959
Don't.

01:11:09.794 --> 01:11:12.029
You stay right there.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.802
Green. Two minutes.

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:42.704
You are not going to kill me.

01:11:42.794 --> 01:11:44.639
I already tried.

01:11:44.729 --> 01:11:46.074
You pushed me off a boat.

01:11:46.164 --> 01:11:48.143
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

01:11:48.233 --> 01:11:50.512
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:54.071
No, but you're not
angry enough.

01:11:55.507 --> 01:11:59.210
Because anger scars over
into despair.

01:12:01.078 --> 01:12:03.448
I look in your eyes...

01:12:04.849 --> 01:12:06.551
I see despair.

01:12:10.355 --> 01:12:13.635
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!

01:12:13.725 --> 01:12:15.370
Thinking that you're better!

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.528
Enough!

01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:43.621
Tell me everything
as it happens.

01:12:45.924 --> 01:12:47.991
Seal me this side.

01:13:05.075 --> 01:13:07.555
Yellow, 60 seconds.

01:13:07.645 --> 01:13:09.280
60. Check.

01:13:23.895 --> 01:13:26.641
Blue, 45 seconds.

01:13:26.731 --> 01:13:28.433
Blue, 45, check.

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:47.385
Okay, Red.
Coming to you.

01:14:02.433 --> 01:14:05.336
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

01:14:50.381 --> 01:14:51.816
All right, everyone set?

01:14:57.689 --> 01:14:59.691
And five...

01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:02.126
four...

01:15:02.894 --> 01:15:03.861
three...

01:15:04.963 --> 01:15:06.164
two...

01:15:08.099 --> 01:15:09.300
<i>one.</i>

01:15:31.856 --> 01:15:32.890
Go, Yellow!

01:15:36.661 --> 01:15:38.007
We got a problem!

01:15:38.097 --> 01:15:40.898
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:49.293
Check the
radio chatter.

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:08.456
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

01:18:08.546 --> 01:18:10.125
This is not one of them.

01:18:10.215 --> 01:18:11.883
That's what he's after.

01:18:15.486 --> 01:18:16.664
Can't understand this.

01:18:16.754 --> 01:18:18.332
You said you spoke Estonian.

01:18:18.422 --> 01:18:20.002
It's not Estonian.

01:18:20.092 --> 01:18:21.359
It's backwards.

01:18:26.497 --> 01:18:27.899
The hell is that?

01:18:43.148 --> 01:18:44.615
Go, go, go!

01:19:31.028 --> 01:19:33.008
Don't give it to him.

01:19:33.098 --> 01:19:34.275
This isn't plutonium.

01:19:34.365 --> 01:19:35.733
It's worse than that,
God damn it!

01:19:54.353 --> 01:19:55.586
Sorry.

01:20:11.535 --> 01:20:12.703
He's getting away.

01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:15.650
He left her
in the car!

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:18.176
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

01:20:31.555 --> 01:20:32.924
Pull up alongside!

01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:51.008
Come on, come on. Closer!

01:20:54.712 --> 01:20:56.514
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

01:20:58.417 --> 01:21:00.085
Hurry up!

01:21:01.485 --> 01:21:02.820
Please!

01:21:38.856 --> 01:21:41.726
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

01:21:42.493 --> 01:21:43.928
What cavalry?

01:22:48.025 --> 01:22:50.295
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

01:22:52.863 --> 01:22:54.309
I don't know what you're
talkin' about.

01:22:54.399 --> 01:22:56.734
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

01:22:58.803 --> 01:23:00.415
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

01:23:00.505 --> 01:23:01.772
is it really in the BMW?

01:23:03.175 --> 01:23:04.119
I don't know.

01:23:04.209 --> 01:23:05.576
Tell me or
I'll shoot her again!

01:23:07.479 --> 01:23:08.522
Leave her alone!

01:23:08.612 --> 01:23:09.957
Kill him!

01:23:10.047 --> 01:23:11.916
I don't have time
to negotiate.

01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:18.733
- Listen to me!
- Three.

01:23:18.823 --> 01:23:19.800
I can help you.

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:21.303
- Help me!
- Two.

01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:22.404
Please!

01:23:22.494 --> 01:23:23.727
- Don't!
- One.

01:23:27.898 --> 01:23:29.534
Next one's a bullet
to the head.

01:23:31.236 --> 01:23:32.680
- No!
- One.

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:34.449
Two. Three.

01:23:34.539 --> 01:23:35.873
Okay! Okay.

01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:38.719
The car. The BMW.

01:23:38.809 --> 01:23:40.122
I left it in the BMW.

01:23:40.212 --> 01:23:41.379
We're going to check
this is real.

01:23:43.981 --> 01:23:46.028
It's in the glove box!

01:23:46.118 --> 01:23:48.120
Where did you leave it?

01:23:48.953 --> 01:23:50.898
Car or fire truck, which one?

01:23:50.988 --> 01:23:53.667
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

01:23:53.757 --> 01:23:54.859
I already told you.

01:23:55.926 --> 01:23:57.372
I believe you.

01:23:57.462 --> 01:23:59.663
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:13.621
Clear!

01:24:13.711 --> 01:24:15.390
Wheeler, go check
the other side.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.724
You two.

01:24:16.814 --> 01:24:18.060
Where did he go?

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:19.151
The past.

01:24:42.107 --> 01:24:43.452
It's in
the glove box!

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:46.478
We're going to check
this is real.

01:24:49.114 --> 01:24:51.592
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

01:24:51.682 --> 01:24:53.485
Next one's a bullet to the head.

01:24:54.852 --> 01:24:57.099
- No! No!
- One.

01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:59.101
- Listen to me.
- Two.

01:24:59.191 --> 01:25:00.268
Three.

01:25:00.358 --> 01:25:01.936
I can help you.

01:25:02.026 --> 01:25:04.039
I don't have time to negotiate.

01:25:04.129 --> 01:25:05.463
Tell me
or I'll shoot her again.

01:25:07.132 --> 01:25:08.376
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

01:25:08.466 --> 01:25:09.677
is it really in the BMW?

01:25:09.767 --> 01:25:11.213
I don't know.

01:25:11.303 --> 01:25:13.714
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

01:25:13.804 --> 01:25:15.350
Who told you that?

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.419
If you're not telling
the truth, she dies.

01:25:17.509 --> 01:25:19.710
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:25:31.822 --> 01:25:33.258
- Medic!
- Check in.

01:25:34.626 --> 01:25:36.304
She's been shot?

01:25:36.394 --> 01:25:38.263
Bring her back,
this side.

01:25:39.698 --> 01:25:41.399
Was she shot with
an inverted round?

01:25:46.804 --> 01:25:48.973
This is Ives. He's one of us.

01:25:50.442 --> 01:25:52.387
"Us"! Who are these guys?

01:25:52.477 --> 01:25:54.589
Priya's. Ours.

01:25:54.679 --> 01:25:56.324
How did Sator know
about the ambush?

01:25:56.414 --> 01:25:58.026
It's posterity.

01:25:58.116 --> 01:26:00.095
An ambush in the middle of the
street can't stay out of the records.

01:26:00.185 --> 01:26:03.398
Bullshit! He knew every move
we made! Every one of 'em.

01:26:03.488 --> 01:26:04.698
Somebody talked. Who was it?

01:26:04.788 --> 01:26:06.767
- Was it you?
- No. No.

01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:08.903
At every stage,
you've known too much.

01:26:08.993 --> 01:26:11.962
I'm going to ask you again.

01:26:12.697 --> 01:26:14.898
Did you talk?

01:26:16.434 --> 01:26:17.912
Nobody talked.

01:26:18.002 --> 01:26:20.438
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

01:26:21.172 --> 01:26:22.350
A what?

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.621
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

01:26:26.711 --> 01:26:28.722
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

01:26:28.812 --> 01:26:32.027
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

01:26:32.117 --> 01:26:33.662
knowing everything.

01:26:33.752 --> 01:26:35.763
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

01:26:35.853 --> 01:26:37.432
Which isn't really plutonium,
is it?

01:26:37.522 --> 01:26:39.000
I told you
it was what he was after.

01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:41.792
And you just told him
where it was.

01:26:42.527 --> 01:26:44.772
I lied.

01:26:44.862 --> 01:26:47.642
Jesus.
You lied about it?

01:26:47.732 --> 01:26:52.147
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

01:26:52.237 --> 01:26:54.683
Lying is standard
operating procedure.

01:26:54.773 --> 01:26:55.950
It's spread too far.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.018
Meaning what?

01:26:57.108 --> 01:26:58.353
She's gonna die.

01:26:58.443 --> 01:27:00.121
Standard
operating procedure.

01:27:00.211 --> 01:27:02.023
Can't you help her?
Can we do something?

01:27:02.113 --> 01:27:05.026
Can't we stabilize the inverse
radiation by inverting the patient?

01:27:05.116 --> 01:27:06.228
Takes days.

01:27:06.318 --> 01:27:07.996
Let's go.

01:27:08.086 --> 01:27:10.398
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.

01:27:10.488 --> 01:27:12.766
How long is she gonna live
on this side?

01:27:12.856 --> 01:27:14.502
Three hours, tops.

01:27:14.592 --> 01:27:16.037
I'm taking her through.

01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:18.240
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

01:27:18.330 --> 01:27:20.941
There's no way of
bringing you back.

01:27:21.031 --> 01:27:22.344
We find another machine.

01:27:22.434 --> 01:27:23.967
A week ago? Where?

01:27:25.869 --> 01:27:27.315
Oslo.

01:27:27.405 --> 01:27:29.950
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.785
It's impregnable.

01:27:31.875 --> 01:27:33.921
Mmm... It wasn't last week.

01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:35.523
We're going in.

01:27:35.613 --> 01:27:36.880
You might as well help us.

01:27:38.048 --> 01:27:39.227
This is a proving window.

01:27:39.317 --> 01:27:40.662
As you approach the turnstile,

01:27:40.752 --> 01:27:42.564
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

01:27:42.654 --> 01:27:43.732
do not enter the machine.

01:27:43.822 --> 01:27:45.200
Why not?

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.601
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

01:27:46.691 --> 01:27:47.736
then you ain't getting out.

01:27:47.826 --> 01:27:50.372
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

01:27:50.462 --> 01:27:52.173
See for yourself.

01:27:52.263 --> 01:27:54.332
There's your answer. Let's go.

01:28:18.956 --> 01:28:20.302
She's stabilizing
slowly.

01:28:20.392 --> 01:28:21.969
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

01:28:22.059 --> 01:28:23.338
How long does she need?

01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:26.974
Four, five days.
A week to be sure.

01:28:27.064 --> 01:28:28.643
Hey, Neil. Find a way
to get us to Oslo.

01:28:28.733 --> 01:28:29.933
I'm going back out there.

01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:33.682
To do what?

01:28:33.772 --> 01:28:35.583
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

01:28:35.673 --> 01:28:37.951
You didn't. You lied
about where it was.

01:28:38.041 --> 01:28:39.721
Wait.

01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:41.089
You're going out there for her.

01:28:41.179 --> 01:28:42.823
He threatened to kill her
in the past.

01:28:42.913 --> 01:28:44.749
If he does,
what happens to her here?

01:28:46.016 --> 01:28:47.895
That's unknowable.

01:28:47.985 --> 01:28:50.165
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

01:28:50.255 --> 01:28:51.733
What do you believe?

01:28:51.823 --> 01:28:53.967
What's happened's happened.

01:28:54.057 --> 01:28:56.738
We need to save her,
here and now.

01:28:56.828 --> 01:29:00.508
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

01:29:00.598 --> 01:29:02.843
Don't let them
take her back through there.

01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:03.778
Okay?

01:29:03.868 --> 01:29:05.537
We can't stay here.

01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:08.116
We don't have a lot of time.

01:29:08.206 --> 01:29:11.252
So why don't you find us
a nice, cozy shipping container

01:29:11.342 --> 01:29:13.655
that's just come off a ship
from Oslo?

01:29:13.745 --> 01:29:15.190
This is cowboy shit.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.725
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into

01:29:16.815 --> 01:29:18.126
if you go through that door.

01:29:18.216 --> 01:29:19.960
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

01:29:20.050 --> 01:29:21.830
Wheeler, brief him.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.698
You'll need your own air.

01:29:23.788 --> 01:29:26.801
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

01:29:26.891 --> 01:29:28.303
Number one rule:

01:29:28.393 --> 01:29:30.572
don't come into contact
with your forward self.

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:33.508
It's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.

01:29:33.598 --> 01:29:34.776
We don't have time.

01:29:34.866 --> 01:29:37.345
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

01:29:37.435 --> 01:29:38.413
What?

01:29:38.503 --> 01:29:39.514
Annihilation.

01:29:39.604 --> 01:29:41.182
That would be bad, right?

01:29:41.272 --> 01:29:45.253
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

01:29:45.343 --> 01:29:47.622
Things will feel strange.

01:29:47.712 --> 01:29:49.724
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

01:29:49.814 --> 01:29:53.094
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

01:29:53.184 --> 01:29:54.962
as the transfer of heat
is reversed.

01:29:55.052 --> 01:29:59.801
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

01:29:59.891 --> 01:30:02.670
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.038
This is normal.

01:30:04.128 --> 01:30:05.673
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

01:30:05.763 --> 01:30:07.375
I can't vouch
for the handling.

01:30:07.465 --> 01:30:09.844
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

01:30:09.934 --> 01:30:12.046
You are inverted.
The world is not.

01:30:12.136 --> 01:30:13.882
Was the transponder
on the case?

01:30:13.972 --> 01:30:15.550
We've tossed that case.

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.253
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

01:30:18.343 --> 01:30:20.278
Give me the reader.

01:30:24.148 --> 01:30:25.550
Okay.

01:30:26.384 --> 01:30:28.018
You ready?

01:33:19.524 --> 01:33:22.470
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.697
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

01:33:26.364 --> 01:33:27.976
<i>He was lying.</i>

01:33:28.066 --> 01:33:29.877
<i>It wasn't in the BMW.</i>

01:33:29.967 --> 01:33:30.968
<i>So, where is it?</i>

01:34:17.182 --> 01:34:19.160
I saw the handoff.

01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:22.263
You made me shoot her
for nothing.

01:34:22.353 --> 01:34:26.434
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

01:34:26.524 --> 01:34:28.160
Not even my wife.

01:34:57.622 --> 01:35:00.491
You left Ives and his
team a hell of a cleanup.

01:35:01.526 --> 01:35:04.338
Heat transfer was reversed.

01:35:04.428 --> 01:35:06.240
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

01:35:06.330 --> 01:35:08.443
from a gasoline explosion
in history.

01:35:08.533 --> 01:35:11.469
At this point,
nothing surprises.

01:35:13.004 --> 01:35:14.149
We're headed back to Oslo?

01:35:14.239 --> 01:35:16.350
In a Rotas shipping container.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.286
He's got the material, Neil.

01:35:18.376 --> 01:35:20.388
I handed it to him on a plate.

01:35:20.478 --> 01:35:21.989
I warned you...

01:35:22.079 --> 01:35:23.224
What's happened's happened.

01:35:23.314 --> 01:35:25.226
I get it now.

01:35:25.316 --> 01:35:28.019
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

01:35:29.053 --> 01:35:30.298
That's not fair.

01:35:30.388 --> 01:35:32.633
You were a part of this
before we met.

01:35:32.723 --> 01:35:34.002
Were you working for Priya?

01:35:34.092 --> 01:35:35.003
No.

01:35:35.093 --> 01:35:36.804
Who recruited you, Neil?

01:35:36.894 --> 01:35:39.874
It can't possibly do you any
good to know that right now.

01:35:39.964 --> 01:35:44.879
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

01:35:44.969 --> 01:35:47.872
then you can hear
my life story, okay?

01:35:50.142 --> 01:35:51.719
I'm sorry I involved you.

01:35:51.809 --> 01:35:53.621
You need to tell me
what's going on.

01:35:53.711 --> 01:35:56.524
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

01:35:56.614 --> 01:35:58.259
Good luck, pal.

01:35:58.349 --> 01:36:00.661
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

01:36:00.751 --> 01:36:03.364
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

01:36:03.454 --> 01:36:05.800
She has the right to know
why she might die.

01:36:05.890 --> 01:36:06.834
Am I gonna die?

01:36:06.924 --> 01:36:08.736
Not if we have something
to say about it.

01:36:08.826 --> 01:36:09.971
And we do.

01:36:10.061 --> 01:36:12.273
Who are you?

01:36:12.363 --> 01:36:16.367
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

01:36:22.174 --> 01:36:24.219
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

01:36:24.309 --> 01:36:27.845
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

01:36:36.921 --> 01:36:37.955
You injured?

01:36:43.594 --> 01:36:45.796
What's the algorithm, Neil?

01:36:47.565 --> 01:36:50.835
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.

01:36:52.036 --> 01:36:54.348
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

01:36:54.438 --> 01:36:56.951
so it can't be copied
or communicated.

01:36:57.041 --> 01:36:59.010
It's a black box
with one function.

01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:01.823
Which is?

01:37:01.913 --> 01:37:04.959
Inversion. But not objects
or peoples.

01:37:05.049 --> 01:37:06.161
The world around us.

01:37:06.251 --> 01:37:07.662
I don't understand.

01:37:07.752 --> 01:37:10.331
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

01:37:10.421 --> 01:37:14.169
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

01:37:14.259 --> 01:37:17.839
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

01:37:17.929 --> 01:37:18.873
we dominate.

01:37:18.963 --> 01:37:20.575
They're always
swimming upstream.

01:37:20.665 --> 01:37:22.110
It's what saved your life.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.979
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

01:37:25.069 --> 01:37:26.547
Pissing in the wind.

01:37:26.637 --> 01:37:28.883
And the algorithm can
change the direction of that wind.

01:37:28.973 --> 01:37:31.676
It can invert the entropy
of the world.

01:37:32.344 --> 01:37:33.788
And if that happens?

01:37:33.878 --> 01:37:34.912
Oh...

01:37:35.479 --> 01:37:36.891
End of play.

01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:39.094
"End of play." Can you be
a little more precise?

01:37:39.184 --> 01:37:42.998
Everyone and everything that's ever
lived, destroyed. Instantly.

01:37:43.088 --> 01:37:44.132
Precise enough?

01:37:44.222 --> 01:37:45.923
Including my son.

01:37:48.859 --> 01:37:52.130
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

01:38:07.979 --> 01:38:09.214
On a truck.

01:38:11.482 --> 01:38:12.917
Shouldn't be long now.

01:38:13.985 --> 01:38:16.231
I've been thinking.

01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:18.166
We're their ancestors.

01:38:18.256 --> 01:38:21.069
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

01:38:21.159 --> 01:38:23.471
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

01:38:23.561 --> 01:38:24.895
The what?

01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:27.009
If you went back in time

01:38:27.099 --> 01:38:28.676
and killed
your own grandfather,

01:38:28.766 --> 01:38:30.678
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

01:38:30.768 --> 01:38:31.946
What's the answer?

01:38:32.036 --> 01:38:34.082
There's no answer.
It's a paradox.

01:38:34.172 --> 01:38:35.284
But in the future,

01:38:35.374 --> 01:38:36.951
those in power clearly believe
that you can

01:38:37.041 --> 01:38:38.519
kick grandpa down the stairs,

01:38:38.609 --> 01:38:40.355
gouge his eyes out,

01:38:40.445 --> 01:38:41.622
slit his throat,

01:38:41.712 --> 01:38:43.392
without consequence.

01:38:43.482 --> 01:38:45.227
Could they be right?

01:38:45.317 --> 01:38:46.928
Doesn't matter.

01:38:47.018 --> 01:38:48.663
They believe it.

01:38:48.753 --> 01:38:50.955
So they're willing
to destroy us.

01:38:52.623 --> 01:38:54.336
Can I go back to sleep now?

01:38:54.426 --> 01:38:55.870
No. I thought of
something else.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.837
Great.

01:38:56.927 --> 01:38:58.873
This reversing
the flow of time.

01:38:58.963 --> 01:39:01.742
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

01:39:01.832 --> 01:39:04.079
That we stop them?

01:39:04.169 --> 01:39:06.505
Optimistically, I'd say
that's right.

01:39:06.604 --> 01:39:08.150
Pessimistically?

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.651
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

01:39:10.741 --> 01:39:13.788
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

01:39:13.878 --> 01:39:15.324
Does your head hurt yet?

01:39:15.414 --> 01:39:16.747
Yes.

01:39:20.485 --> 01:39:22.019
Try to sleep.

01:39:36.867 --> 01:39:38.236
Shit.

01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:41.739
They didn't take us inside.

01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.642
What do we do?

01:39:47.745 --> 01:39:49.024
We use the breach.

01:39:49.114 --> 01:39:51.183
The chaos right after impact.
Get ready.

01:39:54.152 --> 01:39:55.753
She healed enough?

01:39:56.488 --> 01:39:58.300
I don't know.

01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:59.734
I've never done this before.

01:39:59.824 --> 01:40:02.471
The fire crew's there.

01:40:02.561 --> 01:40:03.971
You take Kat
through the breach,

01:40:04.061 --> 01:40:05.840
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.532
Then you bring her in.

01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:10.212
How's your arm?

01:40:10.302 --> 01:40:11.936
Not good.

01:40:16.374 --> 01:40:18.243
We move as soon as
we hear the engines.

01:40:22.746 --> 01:40:23.891
- Hold on, hold on.
- What?

01:40:23.981 --> 01:40:25.826
You're bleeding.

01:40:25.916 --> 01:40:27.285
All right, let me take
a look at it.

01:40:33.891 --> 01:40:35.093
Ready?

01:41:07.892 --> 01:41:09.427
Wait here. I'm going in.

01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:08.256
Come on!

01:43:08.346 --> 01:43:09.381
Go, go, go!

01:43:39.644 --> 01:43:40.512
Go!

01:45:22.747 --> 01:45:24.592
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

01:45:24.682 --> 01:45:25.926
Why didn't you say?

01:45:26.016 --> 01:45:27.562
That's a lot of explaining

01:45:27.652 --> 01:45:29.030
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.365
But afterwards?

01:45:30.455 --> 01:45:33.702
Thing's the same,
I knew you'd be okay.

01:45:33.792 --> 01:45:35.303
What's happened's happened.

01:45:35.393 --> 01:45:38.630
If I told you and you acted
differently, who knows?

01:45:40.231 --> 01:45:42.777
The policy is to suppress.

01:45:42.867 --> 01:45:44.679
Whose policy?

01:45:44.769 --> 01:45:46.104
Ours, my friend.

01:45:49.441 --> 01:45:52.544
We're the people saving the
world from what might've been.

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:03.488
Kat?

01:46:04.456 --> 01:46:06.368
I'm here.

01:46:06.458 --> 01:46:08.069
It'll be quite a scar.

01:46:08.159 --> 01:46:09.527
You'll be okay.

01:46:11.896 --> 01:46:13.141
Did it.

01:46:13.231 --> 01:46:15.110
You did what?

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.101
Andrei has the algorithm.

01:46:18.035 --> 01:46:20.037
You don't know where he is.

01:46:21.972 --> 01:46:23.341
Or when.

01:46:24.442 --> 01:46:26.721
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

01:46:26.811 --> 01:46:29.791
If I don't do something, in two
days, she tells me about the 241.

01:46:29.881 --> 01:46:31.459
Nothing can change that.

01:46:31.549 --> 01:46:32.550
We'll see.

01:46:33.184 --> 01:46:34.652
Just get her here.

01:46:37.155 --> 01:46:38.289
Hello, Priya.

01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:40.635
What's going on?

01:46:40.725 --> 01:46:42.237
Where's Neil?

01:46:42.327 --> 01:46:45.840
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.

01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:46.907
What did I do?

01:46:46.997 --> 01:46:48.510
It's what you're going to do.

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.745
In two days, you're gonna have
me dangle plutonium-241

01:46:50.835 --> 01:46:53.281
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

01:46:53.371 --> 01:46:55.083
Now, I wanna know why.

01:46:55.173 --> 01:46:57.285
You let Sator get hold of 241?

01:46:57.375 --> 01:46:59.377
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.

01:47:00.879 --> 01:47:03.191
So, tell me about it, Priya.

01:47:03.281 --> 01:47:05.693
It's... It's unique.

01:47:05.783 --> 01:47:07.629
The scientist who built it
took her own life

01:47:07.719 --> 01:47:09.330
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.598
A scientist in the future?

01:47:10.688 --> 01:47:11.666
Generations from now.

01:47:11.756 --> 01:47:13.501
Why does she have to
kill herself?

01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:16.504
You're familiar
with the Manhattan Project?

01:47:16.594 --> 01:47:18.673
As they approached
the first atomic test,

01:47:18.763 --> 01:47:20.241
Oppenheimer became concerned

01:47:20.331 --> 01:47:23.044
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

01:47:23.134 --> 01:47:24.345
engulfing the world.

01:47:24.435 --> 01:47:25.946
They went ahead anyway
and got lucky.

01:47:26.036 --> 01:47:30.618
Think of our scientist as
her generation's Oppenheimer.

01:47:30.708 --> 01:47:33.221
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

01:47:33.311 --> 01:47:36.024
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

01:47:36.114 --> 01:47:37.725
they're destroying themselves.

01:47:37.815 --> 01:47:39.661
The grandfather paradox.

01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:41.629
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

01:47:41.719 --> 01:47:42.831
she rebels,

01:47:42.921 --> 01:47:45.133
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

01:47:45.223 --> 01:47:47.759
and hiding them the best place
she can think of.

01:47:48.426 --> 01:47:49.471
The past.

01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:50.438
Here, now.

01:47:50.528 --> 01:47:52.941
There are nine nuclear powers.

01:47:53.031 --> 01:47:54.975
Nine bombs.

01:47:55.065 --> 01:47:58.012
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

01:47:58.102 --> 01:48:00.114
The best hiding place possible.

01:48:00.204 --> 01:48:02.983
Nuclear containment facilities.

01:48:03.073 --> 01:48:04.452
Sator's lifelong mission,

01:48:04.542 --> 01:48:07.155
financed and guided
by the future, has been to

01:48:07.245 --> 01:48:09.657
find and reassemble
the algorithm.

01:48:09.747 --> 01:48:10.959
Why do they choose him?

01:48:11.049 --> 01:48:12.961
Because he was at the right
place at the right time.

01:48:13.051 --> 01:48:15.029
The collapse of
the Soviet Union.

01:48:15.119 --> 01:48:18.433
The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.

01:48:18.523 --> 01:48:20.902
How many sections does he have?

01:48:20.992 --> 01:48:22.704
After the 241, all nine.

01:48:22.794 --> 01:48:24.572
Jesus Christ.

01:48:24.662 --> 01:48:27.832
And that's why you're going to
do things differently this time.

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.178
To change things?

01:48:30.268 --> 01:48:31.513
So Katherine won't get hurt?

01:48:31.603 --> 01:48:34.105
So Sator won't get
the algorithm.

01:48:35.974 --> 01:48:38.319
If that universe can exist...

01:48:38.409 --> 01:48:39.654
we don't live in it.

01:48:39.744 --> 01:48:41.656
Well, let's try.

01:48:41.746 --> 01:48:43.558
You're going to warn me.

01:48:43.648 --> 01:48:45.226
No, I'm not.

01:48:45.316 --> 01:48:46.861
Ignorance is our ammunition.

01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:48.162
Come on.

01:48:48.252 --> 01:48:50.365
If you had known
what the algorithm was,

01:48:50.455 --> 01:48:52.757
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?

01:48:53.891 --> 01:48:55.837
You want Sator to get
the last section.

01:48:55.927 --> 01:48:58.573
That is the only way he'll
bring together the other eight.

01:48:58.663 --> 01:49:00.875
I was supposed to steal it...

01:49:00.965 --> 01:49:02.076
then lose it?

01:49:02.166 --> 01:49:04.013
Mission accomplished.

01:49:04.103 --> 01:49:05.637
You used me.

01:49:06.471 --> 01:49:08.616
As you used Katherine.

01:49:08.706 --> 01:49:10.942
Standard operating procedure.

01:49:12.111 --> 01:49:13.511
You've done your part.

01:49:14.078 --> 01:49:15.323
My part?

01:49:15.413 --> 01:49:17.959
I'm the protagonist
of this operation.

01:49:18.049 --> 01:49:19.193
You...

01:49:19.283 --> 01:49:21.062
are a protagonist.

01:49:21.152 --> 01:49:24.123
Did you think you were the only
one capable of saving the world?

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.161
No.

01:49:31.262 --> 01:49:32.840
But I am.

01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:34.208
Because I haven't told you

01:49:34.298 --> 01:49:36.077
where he's assembling the
algorithm or when.

01:49:36.167 --> 01:49:37.278
You're about to.

01:49:37.368 --> 01:49:38.947
No, I'm not.

01:49:39.037 --> 01:49:40.304
So, deal us in.

01:49:41.305 --> 01:49:42.650
"Us"?

01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:44.285
Why would you want to
involve her again?

01:49:44.375 --> 01:49:45.853
Because she can get
close to him.

01:49:45.943 --> 01:49:47.221
Does he still trust her?

01:49:47.311 --> 01:49:48.690
He thinks she's dead.

01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.059
But he used to.

01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:52.327
You have started looking at
the world in a new way.

01:49:52.417 --> 01:49:53.761
And now, it's your turn.

01:49:53.851 --> 01:49:55.496
Assuming she
makes it out alive,

01:49:55.586 --> 01:49:57.799
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

01:49:57.889 --> 01:49:58.967
I can't.

01:49:59.057 --> 01:50:00.368
If you don't have
the authority,

01:50:00.458 --> 01:50:02.804
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

01:50:02.894 --> 01:50:04.539
I need your word

01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:07.575
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.

01:50:07.665 --> 01:50:09.634
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:16.607
They'll be safe.

01:50:18.509 --> 01:50:20.622
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.

01:50:20.712 --> 01:50:22.323
<i>Get yourselves up there.</i>

01:50:22.413 --> 01:50:24.292
<i>Ives has a team
ready to invert.</i>

01:50:24.382 --> 01:50:25.827
<i>You have
a turnstile?</i>

01:50:25.917 --> 01:50:28.429
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

01:50:28.519 --> 01:50:31.199
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

01:50:31.289 --> 01:50:33.368
But there are some people,
in the future,

01:50:33.458 --> 01:50:36.961
who want to continue the
algorithm's journey into the past.

01:50:38.029 --> 01:50:39.540
You see...

01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:42.510
<i>Tenet wasn't founded
in the past.</i>

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.803
<i>It will be founded
in the future.</i>

01:51:12.131 --> 01:51:14.043
Can't get over the birds.

01:51:14.133 --> 01:51:15.933
How're you feeling?

01:51:21.206 --> 01:51:22.840
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

01:51:23.641 --> 01:51:24.552
I can't.

01:51:24.642 --> 01:51:25.787
Why not?

01:51:25.877 --> 01:51:27.555
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

01:51:27.645 --> 01:51:29.724
Not with a dead man's switch.

01:51:29.814 --> 01:51:32.061
The fitness tracker he wears.

01:51:32.151 --> 01:51:33.327
He's obsessive
about his health.

01:51:33.417 --> 01:51:34.595
It'll be linked
to a switch,

01:51:34.685 --> 01:51:36.764
probably a simple e-mail burst

01:51:36.854 --> 01:51:38.599
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:40.601
set to fire if his heart stops.

01:51:40.691 --> 01:51:43.072
His death activates
the algorithm.

01:51:43.162 --> 01:51:44.939
He dies, the world ends.

01:51:45.029 --> 01:51:46.697
No one dares kill him.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.935
No, you've missed the point.

01:51:53.205 --> 01:51:54.739
He's intending to end his life.

01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.975
Why?

01:51:59.811 --> 01:52:01.345
He's dying.

01:52:02.181 --> 01:52:04.415
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

01:52:05.716 --> 01:52:07.695
And he's taking the world
with him.

01:52:07.785 --> 01:52:09.998
If he can't have her,
no one can.

01:52:10.088 --> 01:52:14.268
He gets to choose the time and
place for the end of the world.

01:52:14.358 --> 01:52:16.894
What moment?
What does he choose?

01:52:18.729 --> 01:52:21.699
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:23.311
Vietnam.

01:52:23.401 --> 01:52:25.346
You said he vanished. What day?

01:52:25.436 --> 01:52:27.782
I went ashore with Max and he flew
off, but I don't know what day it was.

01:52:27.872 --> 01:52:30.185
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

01:52:30.275 --> 01:52:31.552
He was in Ukraine.

01:52:31.642 --> 01:52:33.287
At the Kiev opera siege.

01:52:33.377 --> 01:52:36.824
How do you know about that?

01:52:36.914 --> 01:52:39.128
The point is, he wasn't on his
yacht, so that's his window.

01:52:39.218 --> 01:52:41.796
To go back to that golden
moment and have it be his last.

01:52:41.886 --> 01:52:43.498
Everyone's last.

01:52:43.588 --> 01:52:45.333
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

01:52:45.423 --> 01:52:46.701
without Sator knowing.

01:52:46.791 --> 01:52:49.004
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

01:52:49.094 --> 01:52:50.505
And not the rest of us.

01:52:50.595 --> 01:52:51.706
Where's the dead drop?

01:52:51.796 --> 01:52:53.474
Knowledge divided, my friend.

01:52:53.564 --> 01:52:54.609
You're not gonna tell me?

01:52:54.699 --> 01:52:56.078
Ignorance is our ammunition.

01:52:56.168 --> 01:52:58.080
But I need you back
on that yacht, Kat.

01:52:58.170 --> 01:52:59.981
Why?

01:53:00.071 --> 01:53:02.416
You have to stop him killing
himself until we know the algorithm

01:53:02.506 --> 01:53:04.418
is out of the dead drop.

01:53:04.508 --> 01:53:06.554
But if I'm caught there,
my son sees.

01:53:06.644 --> 01:53:08.356
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

01:53:08.446 --> 01:53:10.648
if they're gonna be his last.

01:53:11.316 --> 01:53:12.583
They're not.

01:53:37.508 --> 01:53:38.719
It's time.

01:53:38.809 --> 01:53:40.155
We're working our way
back to the 14th,

01:53:40.245 --> 01:53:41.889
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

01:53:41.979 --> 01:53:44.548
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

01:53:45.616 --> 01:53:48.696
You know what a hypocenter is?

01:53:48.786 --> 01:53:51.099
It's ground zero for
an underground nuclear test.

01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:56.271
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

01:53:56.361 --> 01:53:58.673
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

01:53:58.763 --> 01:54:01.742
That explosion
seals up the algorithm.

01:54:01.832 --> 01:54:03.511
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

01:54:03.601 --> 01:54:05.803
before the bomb goes off, eh?

01:54:07.939 --> 01:54:09.684
<i>Line it up.</i>

01:54:09.774 --> 01:54:10.975
<i>Move forward.</i>

01:54:13.077 --> 01:54:14.078
<i>Next.</i>

01:54:18.317 --> 01:54:19.517
<i>Line it up.</i>

01:54:21.153 --> 01:54:22.486
Where's Neil?

01:54:25.424 --> 01:54:26.634
He must've
gone through already.

01:54:26.724 --> 01:54:28.469
I didn't get to say goodbye.

01:54:28.559 --> 01:54:30.172
This is goodbye, isn't it?

01:54:30.262 --> 01:54:31.873
I'd like to say...

01:54:31.963 --> 01:54:33.774
that you don't have to
do this, Kat...

01:54:33.864 --> 01:54:36.944
Worst thing Andrei ever did to
me was that offer he made me.

01:54:37.034 --> 01:54:40.238
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

01:54:41.505 --> 01:54:43.484
I shouted and...

01:54:43.574 --> 01:54:45.653
<i>swore.</i>

01:54:45.743 --> 01:54:48.146
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

01:54:51.482 --> 01:54:53.661
I considered it.

01:54:53.751 --> 01:54:55.963
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

01:54:56.053 --> 01:54:58.123
or because he knows that
about me.

01:54:58.522 --> 01:54:59.724
Oh.

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:02.904
A chance to help save my child.

01:55:02.994 --> 01:55:05.173
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

01:55:05.263 --> 01:55:06.540
No.

01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:08.476
You've killed people
you've hated before.

01:55:08.566 --> 01:55:09.977
It's not usually personal.

01:55:10.067 --> 01:55:12.047
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

01:55:12.137 --> 01:55:13.915
It always counts, Kat.

01:55:14.005 --> 01:55:17.451
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

01:55:17.541 --> 01:55:20.389
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

01:55:20.479 --> 01:55:22.180
he takes us all with him.

01:55:24.749 --> 01:55:27.018
You just keep up
your end, okay?

01:55:30.955 --> 01:55:32.466
Today's the 14th.

01:55:32.556 --> 01:55:34.136
Offshore of Siberia.

01:55:34.226 --> 01:55:35.536
Time for us to go.

01:55:35.626 --> 01:55:36.904
You keep going back
another day,

01:55:36.994 --> 01:55:38.806
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

01:55:38.896 --> 01:55:39.974
And who gets me on the yacht?

01:55:40.064 --> 01:55:41.842
I've got somebody good
lined up.

01:55:41.932 --> 01:55:44.879
When it's over, when you're
raising your boy, carry this.

01:55:44.969 --> 01:55:47.282
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

01:55:47.372 --> 01:55:50.584
Hit "talk," state your
location, hang up.

01:55:50.674 --> 01:55:52.620
Who gets the message?

01:55:52.710 --> 01:55:54.612
Posterity.

01:56:33.751 --> 01:56:35.330
Stalsk-12.

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:38.499
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:42.970
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:46.774
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

01:56:46.864 --> 01:56:48.377
We're Red Team, moving forward.

01:56:48.467 --> 01:56:50.878
In order to distinguish
the teams, you'll wear these.

01:56:50.968 --> 01:56:52.414
Our friends over there,

01:56:52.504 --> 01:56:54.782
Blue Team, led by Commander
Wheeler, are inverted.

01:56:54.872 --> 01:56:56.984
Why don't they let us see them?

01:56:57.074 --> 01:56:58.453
Maybe we won't like
what happened.

01:56:58.543 --> 01:57:01.546
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

01:57:03.315 --> 01:57:06.761
Then, were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter,

01:57:06.851 --> 01:57:09.064
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:13.068
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

01:57:13.158 --> 01:57:17.162
Now, this briefing has the
benefit of their experience.

01:57:33.911 --> 01:57:35.823
Both teams have
countdown watches.

01:57:35.913 --> 01:57:38.460
Ours counts down from ten,
from landing

01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:40.362
to zero to the explosion.

01:57:40.452 --> 01:57:42.097
- <i>Blue Team is reversed.</i>
- Everybody, look to your left.

01:57:42.187 --> 01:57:46.224
If you are not at the LZ
at zero, you are not leaving.

01:57:47.292 --> 01:57:48.537
Do you understand?

01:57:48.627 --> 01:57:52.207
We drop in, clear LZs
for Blue Team evacuation.

01:57:52.297 --> 01:57:54.009
We make our way
into the city proper.

01:57:54.099 --> 01:57:56.710
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.413
there is a turnstile.

01:57:58.503 --> 01:58:00.482
Expect a bitemporal response.

01:58:00.572 --> 01:58:01.949
They'll have inverse ordnance?

01:58:02.039 --> 01:58:04.286
Inverse, conventional,

01:58:04.376 --> 01:58:07.655
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

01:58:07.745 --> 01:58:09.224
On the other side of the city,

01:58:09.314 --> 01:58:11.560
the ground rises to the ridge
above the hypocenter.

01:58:11.650 --> 01:58:15.063
A splinter unit will take this
tunnel from the city

01:58:15.153 --> 01:58:17.065
to the floor of the hypocenter.

01:58:17.155 --> 01:58:19.834
Blue Team located
an entrance here.

01:58:19.924 --> 01:58:22.003
The bomb is in this rock,

01:58:22.093 --> 01:58:25.207
high above,
to trigger a collapse,

01:58:25.297 --> 01:58:26.174
sealing the cavern.

01:58:26.264 --> 01:58:27.875
How do we defuse the bomb
up there?

01:58:27.965 --> 01:58:30.412
We don't. The explosion
takes place as planned.

01:58:30.502 --> 01:58:34.416
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

01:58:34.506 --> 01:58:38.220
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:39.087
Which is?

01:58:39.177 --> 01:58:41.356
Need-to-know, and you don't.

01:58:41.446 --> 01:58:43.191
Any other stupid questions?

01:58:43.281 --> 01:58:45.916
Good. Well, let's go.
Let's get ready.

01:58:48.653 --> 01:58:50.031
I wanted to be
on the first wave.

01:58:50.121 --> 01:58:51.500
There is no first wave.

01:58:51.590 --> 01:58:54.369
Red Team and Blue Team
operate simultaneously.

01:58:54.459 --> 01:58:56.171
Look,

01:58:56.261 --> 01:58:58.373
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

01:58:58.463 --> 01:59:01.775
Now, you wanna be on the team that
lifts the contents of the capsule?

01:59:01.865 --> 01:59:03.878
Absolutely.

01:59:03.968 --> 01:59:06.014
Yeah, that's us.

01:59:06.104 --> 01:59:07.549
We're splinter unit.

01:59:07.639 --> 01:59:09.384
Just us?

01:59:09.474 --> 01:59:13.088
No one who knows the contents of
that capsule can leave the field.

01:59:13.178 --> 01:59:15.946
I thought we'd
manage ourselves.

01:59:25.457 --> 01:59:27.569
It's 40 feet from the
private deck to the water.

01:59:27.659 --> 01:59:29.204
Can you jump it?

01:59:29.294 --> 01:59:30.539
I can dive it.

01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:33.331
Until you see my signal,
you don't let him die.

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:10.602
Thirty seconds!

02:00:51.676 --> 02:00:52.876
Go! Go! Go!

02:01:04.356 --> 02:01:06.434
We're coming in
on a shockwave.

02:01:06.524 --> 02:01:07.858
Hang on, people.

02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:18.236
On your feet!

02:01:31.816 --> 02:01:33.318
There!

02:01:46.297 --> 02:01:47.975
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

02:01:48.065 --> 02:01:49.678
Well, I snuck back
to surprise Andrei.

02:01:49.768 --> 02:01:50.702
Oh, the boss left.

02:01:52.170 --> 02:01:54.516
Well, have Mr. Sator
find me here.

02:01:54.606 --> 02:01:55.916
And don't tell the others.

02:01:56.006 --> 02:01:57.375
I'll get the mess.

02:03:04.876 --> 02:03:05.953
Mines!

02:03:06.043 --> 02:03:07.212
Mines!

02:03:21.292 --> 02:03:22.627
They told me
you'd gone ashore.

02:03:24.995 --> 02:03:26.141
They told me you'd flown off.

02:03:26.231 --> 02:03:28.376
I came back to see you and Max.

02:03:28.466 --> 02:03:31.646
Max is on shore with Anna.

02:03:31.736 --> 02:03:33.448
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

02:03:33.538 --> 02:03:36.518
I was joking.
It was a stupid joke.

02:03:36.608 --> 02:03:38.386
You think I'm
a terrible mother.

02:03:38.476 --> 02:03:42.045
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

02:03:49.587 --> 02:03:52.257
I want things
to be better, Andrei.

02:04:07.772 --> 02:04:09.107
Take cover!

02:04:13.211 --> 02:04:15.089
Get me a goddamn AT4!

02:04:15.179 --> 02:04:16.957
Take him out, now!

02:04:17.047 --> 02:04:18.426
Provide some cover!

02:04:18.516 --> 02:04:20.628
Move, move, move! Let's go!

02:04:20.718 --> 02:04:22.153
Move, move, move!

02:05:32.256 --> 02:05:33.324
Wheeler!

02:05:34.892 --> 02:05:35.937
Get outta there!

02:05:36.027 --> 02:05:37.362
Come on!

02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:43.768
Ives!

02:05:45.970 --> 02:05:47.672
Splinter unit. Here.

02:05:49.307 --> 02:05:51.286
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

02:05:51.376 --> 02:05:56.124
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

02:05:56.214 --> 02:05:59.093
I'll make you a drink.

02:05:59.183 --> 02:06:01.386
Bring my son back to the boat.

02:06:07.592 --> 02:06:08.836
We're runnin' out of time,
let's go!

02:06:08.926 --> 02:06:11.329
If they see us,
it's all for nothing.

02:06:14.966 --> 02:06:16.110
We need a distraction.

02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.835
Don't worry about that.

02:06:21.372 --> 02:06:22.907
On my mark!

02:06:25.777 --> 02:06:28.222
RPG, hit the base!

02:06:28.312 --> 02:06:29.514
That building
on my mark!

02:06:31.649 --> 02:06:33.328
Three! Two!

02:06:33.418 --> 02:06:35.420
One! Fire!

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:37.655
Fire!

02:06:52.437 --> 02:06:53.905
Move! Move!

02:07:09.487 --> 02:07:11.689
We're committed now. Come on.

02:07:17.929 --> 02:07:19.440
What's that?

02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:22.300
I borrowed it
from the CIA.

02:07:23.367 --> 02:07:24.445
What is it?

02:07:24.535 --> 02:07:26.981
The way the world ends.

02:07:27.071 --> 02:07:29.884
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

02:07:29.974 --> 02:07:31.586
I don't understand.

02:07:31.676 --> 02:07:33.811
When I take this,
it's all over.

02:07:34.545 --> 02:07:36.647
Then don't take it yet.

02:07:39.684 --> 02:07:41.385
Why not?

02:07:42.653 --> 02:07:45.067
Because we have
the sunset coming.

02:07:45.157 --> 02:07:47.568
And a little vodka left.

02:07:47.658 --> 02:07:49.671
And Max will be here soon.

02:07:49.761 --> 02:07:53.965
They said they thought it was
you, not Anna, ashore with Max.

02:07:56.634 --> 02:08:00.371
So long as you can tell
the difference.

02:08:02.306 --> 02:08:05.009
A moment's business, my love.

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.466
<i>Mahir, do you copy?</i>

02:08:18.556 --> 02:08:21.836
<i>Not clear. I repeat, not clear!</i>

02:08:21.926 --> 02:08:23.038
Copy that.

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:26.430
I repeat, not clear!

02:08:52.857 --> 02:08:53.925
Neil!

02:08:54.759 --> 02:08:55.827
Neil!

02:09:08.739 --> 02:09:09.841
Go!

02:09:18.583 --> 02:09:21.519
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

02:09:27.558 --> 02:09:29.493
Try him.
See if he's got a grenade.

02:09:34.099 --> 02:09:35.144
Anything?

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:36.644
Nah, nothing.

02:09:36.734 --> 02:09:39.081
Here, you try having
a look. Can you pick it?

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:40.381
<i>I hope not.</i>

02:09:40.471 --> 02:09:42.251
<i>I paid a lot for that lock.</i>

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:45.319
<i>How do you like where my
journey began and yours ends?</i>

02:09:45.409 --> 02:09:46.854
Little radioactive
for my taste.

02:09:46.944 --> 02:09:50.958
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

02:09:51.048 --> 02:09:53.795
We'd work where
no one else would.

02:09:53.885 --> 02:09:56.497
I made a bargain
with the devil.

02:09:56.587 --> 02:09:58.299
Money for time.

02:09:58.389 --> 02:10:00.269
We sold our futures.

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:03.504
And now you're about to make the
same mistake for the entire world.

02:10:03.594 --> 02:10:06.874
<i>It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.</i>

02:10:06.964 --> 02:10:08.277
<i>What was yours?</i>

02:10:08.367 --> 02:10:11.180
<i>You fight for a cause
you barely understand...</i>

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:14.916
<i>with people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.</i>

02:10:15.006 --> 02:10:17.342
<i>When I die,
the world dies with me.</i>

02:10:17.441 --> 02:10:19.320
And your knowledge
dies with you,

02:10:19.410 --> 02:10:23.058
<i>buried in a tomb like an
anonymous Egyptian builder</i>

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:25.726
<i>sealed in a pyramid
to keep his secret.</i>

02:10:25.816 --> 02:10:28.552
Your faith is blind.
You're a fanatic.

02:10:48.739 --> 02:10:51.519
<i>What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?</i>

02:10:51.609 --> 02:10:54.323
I'm not,
I'm creating a new one.

02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:58.860
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a
crystalline tower throws a switch

02:10:58.950 --> 02:11:02.663
and Armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

02:11:02.753 --> 02:11:06.301
Now time itself
switches direction.

02:11:06.391 --> 02:11:08.502
<i>The same sunshine we basked in</i>

02:11:08.592 --> 02:11:12.707
<i>will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.</i>

02:11:12.797 --> 02:11:14.775
How could they wanna kill us?

02:11:14.865 --> 02:11:18.046
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:22.416
<i>Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.</i>

02:11:22.506 --> 02:11:24.675
We're responsible.

02:11:37.922 --> 02:11:40.725
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

02:11:41.959 --> 02:11:43.272
Yes.

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.640
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

02:11:45.730 --> 02:11:47.642
That's exactly
what they're doing.

02:11:47.732 --> 02:11:49.911
<i>But not you. You're a traitor.</i>

02:11:50.001 --> 02:11:51.512
Bringing death to all,
because you have no life

02:11:51.602 --> 02:11:53.181
of your own left.

02:11:53.271 --> 02:11:55.083
<i>When I'm done, life continues.</i>

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:56.817
<i>Not your son's.</i>

02:11:56.907 --> 02:12:00.521
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

02:12:00.611 --> 02:12:02.646
<i>You think God will forgive me?</i>

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.620
Wait!

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:11.622
Wait!

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:13.958
God...

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:26.837
Cover me!

02:12:34.545 --> 02:12:36.614
Go! Go! Go!

02:12:38.082 --> 02:12:40.761
You don't believe
in God, or a future,

02:12:40.851 --> 02:12:42.930
or anything outside
of your own experience.

02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.101
<i>The rest is belief.</i>

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:48.569
And I don't have it.

02:12:48.659 --> 02:12:50.638
Without it, you're not human.

02:12:50.728 --> 02:12:52.264
You're just a madman.

02:12:52.963 --> 02:12:55.010
Or a god.

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.011
<i>Of sorts.</i>

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:57.135
Like I said.

02:13:00.338 --> 02:13:02.351
Don't. Jesus.

02:13:02.441 --> 02:13:03.874
Our time is up.

02:13:10.415 --> 02:13:12.827
I'll give your love to my wife.

02:13:12.917 --> 02:13:15.364
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:16.465
<i>That's right.</i>

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:18.100
After you meet her, she dies.

02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:20.958
<i>I'll just give her
my love instead.</i>

02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:23.095
Don't do...

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:26.098
Volkov...

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:41.346
Enough business,
my love.

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:11.209
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:16.046
But it sounds
terribly important.

02:14:17.948 --> 02:14:19.394
Where are you going?

02:14:19.484 --> 02:14:20.684
Aren't you hot?

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:38.813
What are you doing now?

02:14:38.903 --> 02:14:40.748
I spilled sunscreen.

02:14:40.838 --> 02:14:42.907
- So what?
- Slippery!

02:14:45.976 --> 02:14:47.711
Just come here.

02:14:50.714 --> 02:14:52.127
Turn over.

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.717
You'll like it.

02:15:27.952 --> 02:15:30.265
I can't do this.

02:15:30.355 --> 02:15:32.633
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

02:15:32.723 --> 02:15:35.759
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.773
You're dying alone, Andrei.

02:15:39.863 --> 02:15:41.109
Come on, come on,
come on!

02:15:41.199 --> 02:15:43.878
Tunnel's sealed,
gate's closed.

02:15:43.968 --> 02:15:46.047
Mahir, do you copy?

02:15:46.137 --> 02:15:46.947
Yeah.

02:15:47.037 --> 02:15:49.006
<i>Hold. I repeat, hold!</i>

02:15:54.279 --> 02:15:55.313
Look in my eyes.

02:15:56.747 --> 02:15:58.316
Which do you see?

02:15:59.417 --> 02:16:02.354
Despair or anger?

02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:05.766
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

02:16:05.856 --> 02:16:08.025
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:13.531
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:17.901
No!

02:16:36.853 --> 02:16:38.933
Shit.

02:16:39.022 --> 02:16:41.136
<i>Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.</i>

02:16:41.226 --> 02:16:44.296
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

02:17:02.379 --> 02:17:05.216
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:10.954
Ah, screw it.

02:18:21.325 --> 02:18:24.004
<i>Kat!
You jumped the gun!</i>

02:18:24.094 --> 02:18:25.873
I couldn't do it.

02:18:25.963 --> 02:18:28.043
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:30.911
I knew you'd find a way.

02:18:31.001 --> 02:18:32.913
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

02:18:33.003 --> 02:18:35.106
<i>Yeah, found a way. Be safe.</i>

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.505
Thought you were inverted.

02:18:58.596 --> 02:19:00.365
Changed gears halfway.

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:03.378
Looked like you
needed help here.

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:05.968
Here?
We needed help down there.

02:19:07.004 --> 02:19:09.117
How'd you get that lock open?

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:11.476
Wasn't me.
Didn't your team need you?

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:14.312
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

02:19:14.945 --> 02:19:16.358
All right, Ives?

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:18.349
Once I've caught my breath.

02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:35.031
No one who's seen this
leaves the field.

02:19:43.741 --> 02:19:45.343
All right.

02:19:48.746 --> 02:19:50.248
We hide it.

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:53.061
We end our lives.

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.520
That's the only way to be sure.

02:19:57.121 --> 02:19:59.267
As to when...

02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:02.059
maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:04.239
You're not gonna kill us?

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:06.875
If I ever find you, I will.

02:20:06.965 --> 02:20:08.533
But you won't look too hard?

02:20:09.567 --> 02:20:10.702
Yes, I will.

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:16.551
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:17.352
No.

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:19.277
It's far too dangerous.

02:20:19.944 --> 02:20:21.613
Even from afar?

02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:24.349
Even from afar.

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:27.719
Ives!

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:30.121
Wait.

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:37.795
Are you really going back in?

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:43.578
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:46.437
Well, I don't know any
locksmiths as good as you.

02:20:47.805 --> 02:20:49.584
See?

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:51.753
It's me in there, again.

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:55.179
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:04.722
Neil, wait!

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.971
Just saved the world.

02:21:11.061 --> 02:21:13.341
Can't leave anything to chance.

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:16.277
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

02:21:16.367 --> 02:21:18.580
"What's happened's happened."

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:22.317
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

02:21:22.407 --> 02:21:24.242
It's not an excuse
to do nothing.

02:21:24.709 --> 02:21:25.620
Fate?

02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:27.255
Call it what you want.

02:21:27.345 --> 02:21:28.546
What do you call it?

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:30.548
Reality.

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:34.519
Now let me go.

02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:42.770
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:44.629
Haven't you guessed by now?

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:47.108
You did.

02:21:47.198 --> 02:21:49.878
Only not when you thought.

02:21:49.968 --> 02:21:52.280
You have a future in the past.

02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:55.540
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:58.109
You've known me for years?

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:03.458
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:06.060
But for me,
it's just the beginning.

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:08.329
We get up to some stuff.

02:22:08.419 --> 02:22:11.599
You're gonna love it.
You'll see.

02:22:11.689 --> 02:22:14.292
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:16.160
Whose?

02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:19.073
Yours!

02:22:19.163 --> 02:22:20.642
You're only halfway there.

02:22:20.732 --> 02:22:22.767
I'll see you
at the beginning, friend.

02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:34.589
<i>We're the people saving the
world from what might have been.</i>

02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:36.614
<i>World will never know
what could've happened.</i>

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:41.519
<i>And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.</i>

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:48.159
<i>'Cause no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.</i>

02:22:48.926 --> 02:22:50.762
<i>Only the one that did.</i>

02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:54.599
Do it before the boy comes out.

02:22:57.136 --> 02:23:00.415
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

02:23:00.505 --> 02:23:04.053
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

02:23:04.143 --> 02:23:06.244
Here, today.

02:23:07.345 --> 02:23:10.558
How did you know?

02:23:10.648 --> 02:23:14.029
<i>Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...</i>

02:23:14.119 --> 02:23:15.396
Posterity.

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:19.068
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

02:23:19.158 --> 02:23:22.904
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

02:23:22.994 --> 02:23:26.041
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

02:23:26.131 --> 02:23:27.241
Then whose was it?

02:23:27.331 --> 02:23:29.210
Mine.

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:32.747
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.706
I'm the protagonist.

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:40.278
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

02:23:43.047 --> 02:23:44.582
Mission accomplished.

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:48.663
<i>It's the bomb that
didn't go off.</i>

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:51.522
<i>The danger no one knew
was real.</i>

02:23:56.561 --> 02:23:59.831
<i>That's the bomb with the real
power to change the world.</i>
