00:02.132 --> 00:03.655
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:03.699 --> 00:05.005
DELILAH:
I saw something.

00:05.048 --> 00:08.008
The money, the guns...

00:08.051 --> 00:09.139
Who are you?

00:09.183 --> 00:10.488
MEL:
Word on the Altnet

00:10.532 --> 00:12.360
is that you are
a real-life hero.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.840
Your legend is growing.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.668
ROBYN:
This is Melody,
one of my oldest friends.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.018
HARRY:
Why do I have a feeling

00:18.061 --> 00:19.802
this is not a social call?

00:19.845 --> 00:21.238
ROBYN:
I need those freaky-ass
superpowers of yours.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.068
Since they don't play
by the rules, neither can I.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.156
[grunting]

00:28.550 --> 00:31.509
How can I ever trust him again?MEL: Bishop probably hates
that you're mad at him.

00:31.553 --> 00:34.034
Use that to leverage him.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.210
You're not planning
on shooting me, are you?

00:36.253 --> 00:38.038
Depends on
how this meeting goes.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.388
ROBYN:
Thank you for not taking a shot
back in the subway.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.433
DANTE:
Maybe the world does need you.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.219

01:04.586 --> 01:05.804
[tires screech]

01:08.633 --> 01:10.113
VI:
You all packed
for your geology trip

01:10.157 --> 01:11.114
this weekend?

01:11.158 --> 01:13.638
Yep. I'm all ready.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.814
I still find it astonishing
that you want to spend

01:15.858 --> 01:17.555
your entire weekend looking
at rocks.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.383
You know caves
don't have Wi-Fi, right?

01:19.427 --> 01:21.603
I'm evolving.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.170
Uh-huh.
ROBYN:
Hey.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.693
Hey, baby.Good morning.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.564
Hey.
Thank you.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.305
You know
we're gonna miss you

01:28.349 --> 01:30.133
this weekend for the Costco run.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.439
Could use

01:31.482 --> 01:33.093
those sharp little elbows
for the crowds.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.791
You know, something tells me
you can handle yourself.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.404
[phone vibrates, dings]

01:41.188 --> 01:42.667
Is that work?

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323
It is.

01:48.020 --> 01:52.155
You know, I'm going to try
a new Pilates studio today.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.591
Really?

01:53.635 --> 01:57.334
So everyone is just...
having a normal day.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.253
[sighs]
Dee, I know this is weird...

02:03.297 --> 02:05.516
Yeah, it's really weird. Yeah.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.823
Am I just supposed
to make small talk

02:07.866 --> 02:10.695
and eat my bagel like
you're notgonna spend your day

02:10.739 --> 02:13.263
going Jessica Jones on bad guys?

02:13.307 --> 02:15.483
No.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.792
You're supposed to offer me
the other half of that bagel.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.622
It's all yours.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.325
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

02:31.368 --> 02:32.630
That girl goes out
to get the mail,

02:32.674 --> 02:34.110
and she calls it a hike--
now all of a sudden,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.679
she wants to spend her weekend
exploring a cave.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.333
[sighs]

02:39.376 --> 02:42.945
Until the dust settles in
this house, I can't see a thing.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.775
[cameras clicking]

02:46.818 --> 02:49.081
The Prophet teaches us

02:49.125 --> 02:52.346
that kindness is
an act of faith.

02:52.389 --> 02:55.479
As a diplomat and father
living abroad,

02:55.523 --> 02:57.829
it's important
that we have a place

02:57.873 --> 02:59.701
to celebrate our culture.

02:59.744 --> 03:02.182
Saudi Arabia
is modernizing,

03:02.225 --> 03:04.706
and I'd like
to commend my wife,

03:04.749 --> 03:06.360
Misa,

03:06.403 --> 03:07.274
and my daughter,

03:07.317 --> 03:09.189
Mira, for
helping bring

03:09.232 --> 03:11.582
this cultural center to life.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.323
Bismillah!

03:25.901 --> 03:28.120
â™ª

03:39.131 --> 03:40.698
I don't have much time.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.265
I was followed,
he's outside.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.268
Just calm down,
take a deep breath.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.574
Tell me what's wrong.

03:46.617 --> 03:47.923
My little brother, Ali,

03:47.966 --> 03:50.055
we were supposed to meet
a couple days ago,

03:50.099 --> 03:51.274
but he never showed.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.797
It's like he just vanished.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.147
I've called all the places
he goes-- his university,

03:55.191 --> 03:56.540
Soho House-- nothing.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.760
He's never gone a day
without texting me.

03:58.803 --> 03:59.891
Did you go to the police?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.371
I can't.
My parents are refusing.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.199
Won't even discuss it with me.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.680
But they know something.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.029
You think he's in danger?

04:07.072 --> 04:08.204
I know he is.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.727
Ever since Ali
disappeared,

04:09.771 --> 04:11.425
Saudi men have been coming
into the house,

04:11.468 --> 04:13.383
pulling my parents
behind closed doors.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.125
My mother is scared.
I can see it.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.258
And there are eyes on me
all the time.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.129
My computer. My phone.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.913
I even had to borrow
my friend's cell

04:21.957 --> 04:23.567
just to send you
a message.
Mira,

04:23.611 --> 04:25.874
what do you think might be
going on with your brother?

04:25.917 --> 04:29.834
Uh, there were fights at home,
him and my parents.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.923
They were trying to get him
into an arranged marriage

04:31.967 --> 04:33.098
back in Saudi Arabia,

04:33.142 --> 04:34.578
but this is bigger.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.232
[door opens]Something is very wrong.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.756
You have to find my brother.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.105
Help him.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.672
I will do everything
in my power.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.152
In the meantime,

04:43.195 --> 04:45.328
there are no
eyes on this.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.460
Take it.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.070
You go. I'll keep
in touch with you.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.335
You want to take on the Saudis?

04:52.379 --> 04:53.815
The guys with
all the weapons,

04:53.858 --> 04:54.859
all the money

04:54.903 --> 04:56.252
and the diplomatic
immunity.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.471
Those are the guys
you want to piss off?

04:57.514 --> 04:59.299
Do you know what Mira risked
to come to me?

04:59.342 --> 05:02.040
Not only is she living
under an oppressive regime,

05:02.084 --> 05:03.172
but her father is

05:03.215 --> 05:05.217
a senior diplomat
who works for it.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.568
Stepping out of line like that
would have...

05:07.611 --> 05:08.743
major consequences.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.440
I mean,
she must have been terrified.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.616
Whatever trouble
her brother is in,

05:12.660 --> 05:14.575
she needs someone by her side.Well, I mean,

05:14.618 --> 05:16.751
something's definitely up--
Ali cleaned out his bank account

05:16.794 --> 05:18.927
a few days ago; his phone's
been inactive just as long.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.798
But, I mean, nothing
about this guy spells trouble.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.323
Nothing to indicate why he
would suddenly go missing,

05:23.366 --> 05:25.325
or why the Saudis would be
so worked up over it.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.675
He's working on his post-grad
degree in psychology.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.199
He loves crossword puzzles.
He's obsessed

05:30.242 --> 05:31.809
with the Saudi
national football team.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.811
I mean, the kid's adorable.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.422
We need to know more about Ali.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.510
What he's into.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.381
His apartment
might give us both.

05:40.514 --> 05:43.430
What, weapons and immunity?
You're not going alone.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.960
Hey, Dante,

05:52.003 --> 05:54.092
you got a minute?Detective Mallory.
What can I do for you?

05:54.136 --> 05:56.268
D.A.'s put me
on this vigilante case.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.835
I know you had
a few run-ins with her.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.141
I wanted to ask you
some questions.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.185
I gave the D.A.
everything I know.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.665
Yeah, I read the report.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.363
Former
military intelligence,

06:03.406 --> 06:05.582
moral compass, highly skilled.

06:05.626 --> 06:08.193
Thinks she's a do-gooder.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.282
Cop to cop,
what'd you leave out?

06:10.326 --> 06:13.373
[chuckles]
Think I'm keeping secrets?

06:13.416 --> 06:16.376
I'm just looking for some color.

06:17.159 --> 06:20.162
She's clever,
uses sophisticated tactics.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.381
It won't be easy.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.425
Easy's no fun.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.383
I like the cat-and-mouse.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.732
Long as you're the cat.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.081
Don't underestimate her.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.648
Oh, I'm not you.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.433
If she's in my crosshairs,
I won't hesitate to shoot.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.094
Still all clear.
No Saudi activity.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.095
ROBYN:
Copy.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.879
Approaching now.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.377
[keys jangling]

07:05.163 --> 07:06.600
Okay, I'm in.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.864
Somebody definitely beat me
to it.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.169
Tossed?

07:11.213 --> 07:12.867
Yeah.
Someone came looking for Ali.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.782
Or something he had.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.832
Judging by the looks of it,
they're motivated.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.007
[Mel screams]

07:23.051 --> 07:26.141
[line beeps]Mel? Mel?

07:26.184 --> 07:27.534
Mel?

07:29.057 --> 07:30.450
Spotter.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.685
[man shouts in Arabic]

07:51.819 --> 07:53.342
[shouts in Arabic]

08:01.176 --> 08:02.394
[grunts]

08:06.181 --> 08:07.269
[tires screech]Bishop!

08:07.312 --> 08:08.705
What are you doing here?

08:08.749 --> 08:10.272
There's ten Saudis
around that corner. Get in.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.839
How'd you know?

08:11.882 --> 08:14.363
'Cause I'm working
with them. Let's go!

08:18.193 --> 08:20.717
â™ª

08:30.553 --> 08:33.513
Sorry, I didn't have time
to win you over.Sure. Best way

08:33.556 --> 08:34.862
to do that is to bind
a girl's wrists

08:34.905 --> 08:36.341
and throw her
in the back of your car.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.865
It's hard to watch McCall's six
when you're dead.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.520
What, you didn't think
I knew she had people?

08:40.563 --> 08:41.695
I trained her.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.785
Ali Shah.
Why are the Saudis after him?

08:44.828 --> 08:47.222
And why shoot at me for
being in his apartment?

08:47.265 --> 08:50.617
I don't know,
but I'm assuming it's big,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.575
because they called
me to find him.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.969
So you work for the Saudis now?Yeah.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.101
Helps me keep an eye
on them for the CIA.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.929
And right now the
CIA wants to know

08:58.973 --> 09:01.279
why the Saudis have called out
their big guns.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.672
Who are their big guns?

09:02.716 --> 09:03.978
You know that crew
up in his apartment?

09:04.021 --> 09:05.414
Yeah.They're led

09:05.457 --> 09:06.546
by Shakir Khan.

09:06.589 --> 09:07.721
Senior intelligence.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.418
Key enforcer for the regime.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.986
He's the guy they call when
they want someone disappeared.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.336
Is that a nice way
of saying dead?

09:14.379 --> 09:15.642
Exactly.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.252
Look, whatever's
going on,

09:17.295 --> 09:19.863
the CIA doesn't want this
spilling out into the streets.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.212
I'm here because they don't...

09:21.256 --> 09:23.084
They can't afford
to be involved.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.389
And you gotta keep
the oil flowing.

09:24.433 --> 09:27.001
Can't go to bed mad
on the Kingdom, can ya?

09:27.044 --> 09:29.351
Drop it. We don't know
what this kid's done.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.527
And you know the Saudis--
they're ruthless,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.921
they're resourced and they're
way ahead of all of us.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.010
Thanks for the lift.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.447
And thanks for the pep talk.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.536
'Cause you know that woman loves
a challenge, right?

09:40.580 --> 09:44.366
You might as well have given her
a Red Bull and a high five.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.672
Noted.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.022
HARRY:
So, this guy Ali

09:48.065 --> 09:50.111
has drawn the ire
of not one but two of

09:50.154 --> 09:51.765
the most powerful intelligence
agencies in the world.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.158
What the hell
did he do?We need to find Ali first,

09:54.202 --> 09:55.899
if he has any chance
of surviving.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.466
I might be able to help
with that.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.033
I got a bead on Ali's car.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.469
His financials have him parking
at a parking garage

10:00.512 --> 10:02.471
near the Soho House around
the time that he vanished.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.212
So I called the garage.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.213
Car's still there.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.997
Might be
the last place he went.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.782
His sister implied he spends
a lot of time at that club.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.001
I'm on it.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.789
Mira thinks
her parents know something.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.182
If Saudi intelligence
is hunting Ali,

10:18.226 --> 10:21.142
the first thing they would do
is pressure his father, Basam.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.928
We need to get
into his email server.

10:24.972 --> 10:25.929
Which is in the Saudi embassy.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.061
So?

10:27.104 --> 10:28.932
So I'm kind of on a health kick.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.369
You know, eat right,
drink lots of water,

10:31.413 --> 10:33.676
avoid anyone with a state-
sanctioned license to kill.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.939
And I promise you,
that place is

10:35.983 --> 10:38.115
firewalled every way possible.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.989
Maybe to us,
but not to everyone.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.256
[phone vibrating]

10:58.745 --> 10:59.963
Are you okay?

11:00.007 --> 11:01.182
You seem jumpy.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.053
No. I just
didn't eat enough today.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.142
I'm gonna go find something.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.276
MIRA:
What does Saudi intelligence

11:08.319 --> 11:11.018
want with my brother?
What did he do?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.280
We don't know yet.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.195
But I think your parents do.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.414
We have a way for you
to help us find out

11:16.458 --> 11:18.721
what they know about Ali.I'll do anything.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.941
What do you need?

11:20.984 --> 11:22.203
Mira's in.
She just needs

11:22.246 --> 11:23.291
a few minutes to set up.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.814
Great. I'm ready when she is.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.207
So, I got some intel

11:26.250 --> 11:27.643
from a friend who works
at the Soho House.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.645
It turns out Ali
hasn't been inside in months.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.734
That's weird, 'cause
his credit card has him parking

11:31.778 --> 11:34.171
at the valet
on the regular.He lied to his sister.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.260
He wasn't going
to the Soho House.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.609
He was going somewhere else.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.307
Harry, pull up a map
of that neighborhood.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.395
HARRY:Mm-hmm.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.964
It's the Meatpacking
District.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.749
Nightclubs, gambling dens,
kinky hotels, lots of places

11:46.793 --> 11:49.926
a 20-year-old would
want to go on the low.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.233
Hookah lounge.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.408
He had a tip
and a hose

11:53.451 --> 11:54.757
in his apartment,
but no pipe.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.454
Right. So he's smoking
someplace else.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.587
Yeah, but why would he want
to keep that a secret?

11:58.630 --> 12:00.458
Only one way to find out.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.296
[phone ringing]

12:14.385 --> 12:17.301
Mira. What's going on?

12:17.345 --> 12:19.216
Hey, Baba.
Do you have a minute?

12:19.260 --> 12:21.044
I just need you to look
at the press release

12:21.088 --> 12:22.089
for the cultural center.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.351
I'll look at it tonight.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.092
I really need
to get it out today.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.050
Fine. Where is it?

12:27.094 --> 12:29.313
Um, my cloud account.
I sent you the link.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.577
Sweet. I'm in.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.797
You sure this
won't blow back on Mira?

12:34.841 --> 12:36.930
A hundred percent. She's
not opening the door for us.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.322
Basam's system is.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.107
Computers drop
crucial security protocols

12:40.150 --> 12:42.500
in order to access shared data
in the cloud.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.024
How long?
Three minutes to
download data

12:44.067 --> 12:45.112
from Basam's email server.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.504
[whispering]:Go, go,

12:46.548 --> 12:47.897
go, go, go, go.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.594
You have a typo

12:49.638 --> 12:51.205
in the beginning
of the second paragraph.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.250
[tapping keyboard]Okay, got it.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.817
And what else?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.427
Nothing.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.385
It's good.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.517
It's good? No other thoughts?

12:59.561 --> 13:02.042
What, you're asking me
to find problems?

13:02.085 --> 13:04.261
Not enough time. She's got
to stall, she's got to stall.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.046
When have you
ever had trouble doing that?

13:06.089 --> 13:07.656
I have to go.[phone vibrates]

13:07.699 --> 13:09.484
I'll see you at home.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.267
Oh, wait.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.792
Mira, what's going on?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.533
Okay.
[takes deep breath]

13:15.577 --> 13:18.798
The thing is, this isn't
really about the press release.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.843
She's panicking.
She's panicking.
MEL:
No. No.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.062
Just trust her.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.846
It's about Ali.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.761
Baba,I am scared.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.154
I know you know something.

13:27.197 --> 13:29.112
Why can't you just tell me?

13:37.773 --> 13:39.775
I do trust you.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.127
I just wish you trusted me.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.870
Got it![exhales]

13:47.914 --> 13:48.958
I do trust you,[grunts]

13:49.002 --> 13:50.525
but these things
are complicated.

13:50.568 --> 13:51.613
Whew.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.093
It's not something
I can talk about,

13:53.136 --> 13:54.703
but I'll see you at home.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.142
[lively Middle Eastern music
playing]

13:59.186 --> 14:00.448
[indistinct chatter]

14:00.491 --> 14:03.712
Great place.
Lots of character.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.280
Thanks. Yeah,
you want to eat, drink or smoke?

14:06.323 --> 14:07.716
[laughs]:
All the above.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.762
Actually, I just
wanted to know why...

14:10.806 --> 14:12.982
this guy was here.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.810
Why? Who's he?

14:14.854 --> 14:15.811
You don't recognize him?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.032
You got to step your game up.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.990
You're the owner, right?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.426
Reza Shaheen?

14:22.470 --> 14:24.298
You're supposed to
know your customers.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.343
Especially the ones who come in
all the time.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.738
[chuckles]
Wait, what's happening here?

14:29.781 --> 14:32.828
What, your gears turning
a little slow, Cheech?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.613
Look, you tell me
what I want to know,

14:35.657 --> 14:38.355
or you can tell some real cops

14:38.399 --> 14:41.010
why you are serving
underage girls

14:41.054 --> 14:42.577
from Santi Padre High School.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.231
Just level
with me, Reza.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.059
This guy, he's missing.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.321
He might be
in trouble,

14:47.364 --> 14:48.713
and I'm just trying to help him.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.367
Missing? Hold up.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.413
I don't know anything
about that.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.719
I was just trying not to
blow up his spot about the girl.

14:54.763 --> 14:55.938
What girl?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.766
White girl. American.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.507
That's why he was coming here.
To hang with her.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.074
I know he's the son
of some important guy

15:01.117 --> 15:03.728
at the embassy, so I thought
they were keeping it quiet

15:03.772 --> 15:05.600
because his parents
wouldn't be cool.

15:05.643 --> 15:08.081
But, you know, I swear I have
no idea why he'd be missing

15:08.124 --> 15:09.778
or where he is.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.301
MEL:
So, Ali was resisting

15:11.345 --> 15:14.087
an arranged marriage
while secretly meeting up

15:14.130 --> 15:15.653
with a girl his parents
didn't approve of.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.264
It's a real-life
Romeo and Juliet.

15:17.307 --> 15:19.657
Yeah, but the Saudis
wouldn't send their dogs

15:19.701 --> 15:22.138
after Ali just because he was
hooking up with a white girl.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.401
Well, that doesn't mean
Juliet's not involved somehow.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.229
Maybe they got
into something together.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.491
I think I know what.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.842
I've been going
through Basam's emails.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.279
Rob.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.324
They think Ali's a Bee.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.327
What's a Bee?

15:38.807 --> 15:41.462
Two years ago, Saudi Arabia
formed an army of "Flies"

15:41.505 --> 15:43.812
to push Saudi propaganda
on social media.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.248
So Saudi dissidents,

15:45.292 --> 15:47.468
or "Bees,"
waged war with them online.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.078
The last time the
Flies caught a Bee,

15:49.122 --> 15:51.124
they tortured him,
killed him

15:51.167 --> 15:52.821
and carved him up
with a bone saw.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.127
It gets worse.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.650
They're on to Ali

15:55.693 --> 15:57.826
because the Flies raided
a known Bee hangout in the city.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.871
When they came up empty,
they were pissed.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.917
They suspected somebody
tipped them off.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.440
Ali?As a senior diplomat,

16:03.484 --> 16:05.573
Ali's father was informed
of the raid beforehand,

16:05.616 --> 16:07.314
and shortly after,
the leader of the Bees,

16:07.357 --> 16:09.185
whom the Saudis refer to
as "Dissident X,"

16:09.229 --> 16:11.231
sent out a message
warning the Bees

16:11.274 --> 16:12.406
it was gonna happen.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.277
So they think
Ali somehow overheard

16:14.321 --> 16:16.018
his father being briefed
about the raid

16:16.062 --> 16:18.673
and put the word out?They think Ali is Dissident X.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.545
which means if they catch him
he could be the next Khashoggi.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.504
HARRY:
It's only a matter
of time.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.375
Thanks to Defeat Geo,
the Saudis found out

16:25.419 --> 16:27.334
that there's a Bee
safe house in the city.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.423
They think Ali's there, but, uh,

16:29.466 --> 16:30.815
they just don't have
a location yet.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.034
What's Defeat Geo?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.863
Defeat Geo is
a proprietary spy software

16:34.906 --> 16:38.693
which infiltrates mobile devices
and grants unlimited access.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.695
Now, on the occasion that
I help people on the dark web

16:40.738 --> 16:42.740
fight illegal surveillance,
Defeat Geo comes up a lot.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.178
Any chance you'd
ever done work for a Bee?

16:45.221 --> 16:46.483
Oh, I know I have.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.572
There was this one guy,
Zaki Mohammed.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.314
He had to flee Saudi Arabia
because of his tweets.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.621
Now, I had to do
Internet security for him

16:53.664 --> 16:54.709
because the Saudis
will literally never

16:54.752 --> 16:56.189
stop hunting this guy down.

16:56.232 --> 16:59.453
Wait, so then he would know
where the safe house is.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.063
He's how we get to Ali.No, we're not doing that.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.544
Why?You're saying you
can't track down Zaki?

17:03.587 --> 17:06.851
Of course I can. In a heartbeat.
I did his security.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.418
But it would be a huge
betrayal of his trust.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.030
Guys like us live or
die by our anonymity.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.858
Disrespecting that would be a--
would be a huge violation.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.818
Come on, Harry, you
already saved the guy's life.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.038
Maybe you could do
the same thing for Ali.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.869
Oh... Oh, man.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.088
Well, I can't
reach out to him online.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.742
You know, he'll-he'll--

17:27.785 --> 17:29.787
he'll get spooked,
he'll go dark.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.356
I mean, I'd have
to go in person.I'm coming with you.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.141
No, no, I gotta
go alone. I mean,

17:35.184 --> 17:37.230
these guys know to
look out for spotters.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.319
Rob's right.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.147
Ali and I are both running.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.584
The difference is
I get caught, I go to jail.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.455
Ali gets caught,

17:45.499 --> 17:48.632
he gets murdered.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.379
HARRY [quietly]:
Zaki.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.685
Do I know you?

17:57.728 --> 18:00.557
Yes. I patched your security.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.385
I'm deadtrain.

18:03.299 --> 18:06.085
Wait, no. Just-- whoa, whoa.
I need to talk to you.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.348
I would not have come here
if it wasn't a matter

18:08.391 --> 18:09.827
of life or death, I swear.

18:09.871 --> 18:13.004
But one of your friends
is in serious trouble.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.100
Follow me.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.846
[sighs] I'm sorry, man.
I know it's not cool,

18:28.890 --> 18:29.891
me just popping up like...

18:42.860 --> 18:44.993
Zaki, just listen to me...

18:45.036 --> 18:46.995
Who sent you?

18:47.038 --> 18:48.475
Nobody. Okay?

18:48.518 --> 18:50.433
I'm trying to save
a Bee-- Ali Shah.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.000
He's in a safe house,
but he's not safe.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.350
There is no safe house.
Whoever sent you has bad intel.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.744
I'm alone.
I'm on your side.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.354
Do you know why
I did your security?

18:58.398 --> 19:00.139
Because I know what it's like.

19:01.444 --> 19:05.405
I'm dead. Okay? I worked
for the government.

19:05.448 --> 19:09.365
Cyber warfare.
And I found evidence.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.803
Bad stuff, dude.
Unforgivable crimes

19:12.847 --> 19:14.544
our military was committing.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.937
So I leaked it.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.244
You know, I thought I was
doing the right thing,

19:18.287 --> 19:19.506
holding my government
accountable.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.116
but they came after me,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.379
and they made me leave
everything I knew.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.555
My family, my life, everything.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.557
That's why I wanted
to help you.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.950
That's why I want to help Ali.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.909
You don't know what it's like.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.085
I didn't just leave
my family behind.

19:34.129 --> 19:37.567
The Saudis dragged them
to jail after I fled.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.918
Tortured my best friend.

19:40.962 --> 19:44.226
Forced her to call and tell me
what they're doing to her,

19:44.270 --> 19:45.575
what they'll keep doing to her

19:45.619 --> 19:46.968
if I keep speaking out.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.492
These people
would burn the city

19:49.536 --> 19:51.190
to the ground to get to me.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.192
Who's to say
they're not using you?

19:53.235 --> 19:56.978
Because they'd have
to find me first.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.632
If you think that little
ten-minute patch

19:58.675 --> 20:00.068
I did for you is good,

20:00.111 --> 20:03.202
can you imagine
how secure my own life is?

20:11.340 --> 20:12.298
Thank you.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.822
I don't know Ali Shah.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.694
Most Bees don't know each other.
It's safer that way.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.569
But I can get
the location of the safe house.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.615
ROBYN:
Great job, Harry.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.008
I'm about ten minutes
from the safe house.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.140
I'll call you after.HARRY: Great.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.707
[incoming call beeps]

20:30.751 --> 20:32.666
What's up, Auntie?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.102
I was dropping off laundry

20:34.145 --> 20:35.930
in Dee's room when I saw
what she packed

20:35.973 --> 20:37.888
for her geology trip.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.108
Now, I don't know what
you wear in a cave,

20:40.151 --> 20:45.026
but I know it's not strappy,
so I dug a bit.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.769
I found a fake ID and
the printout ticket

20:48.812 --> 20:53.600
to a Megan Thee Stallion concert
in Philly.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.601
What?

20:54.644 --> 20:56.777
Okay, a hip-hop concert,

20:56.820 --> 20:59.170
two nights, 100 miles away?

20:59.214 --> 21:02.435
I could strangle that girl.
She is really testing me.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.306
I think it's time
for another family meeting.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.439
And tell her what,
that I went through her bag?

21:06.482 --> 21:07.614
She's just gonna turn around

21:07.657 --> 21:08.876
and go right back
to her father's.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.271
This is the fallout

21:12.314 --> 21:14.316
for telling her what I do.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.492
No, she bought
the ticket months ago.

21:16.536 --> 21:20.017
Well, regardless, she's
going through with it today.

21:20.061 --> 21:21.758
It didn't even bother her
that she lied

21:21.802 --> 21:23.325
to our faces this morning.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.284
Because as far as
she's concerned,

21:25.327 --> 21:28.069
I've been lying to her
her whole life.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.072
I'm gonna have to think
about this,

21:31.115 --> 21:32.334
but I can't think
about it now.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.205
There's someone else
I have to save.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.729
[call beeps off]

21:48.785 --> 21:50.396
[sighs]

21:56.097 --> 21:57.838
Hey, McCall.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.843
Marcus.
Question for you.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.715
Close the case yet?Day's still young.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.456
Times you crossed with her,
Was there any connection

22:07.500 --> 22:09.240
you could draw
between the vigilante

22:09.284 --> 22:10.677
and the Saudi embassy?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.896
I don't think so. Why?

22:12.940 --> 22:14.245
Because there is now.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.377
Embassy got in
touch with NYPD

22:15.421 --> 22:16.813
through the State Department.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.598
Somebody matching
the vigilante's description

22:18.641 --> 22:19.816
interfered in their business.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.035
What kind of business?

22:21.078 --> 22:22.558
Something about
a diplomat's kid.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.255
They asked if she was ours.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.953
Looks like they might
do my job for me.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.651
I'm going to go
meet with them now.

22:28.695 --> 22:31.741
See if I can get any intel
on what she's a part of.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.227
ROBYN:
Who's that?

22:39.270 --> 22:40.489
One of Shakir's men.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.491
Looks like Ali was as dangerous

22:42.535 --> 22:44.319
as the Saudis were
making him out to be.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.412
Except this was self-defense.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.979
The assailant was armed.

22:52.022 --> 22:54.764
The door's busted in,
so clearly he didn't knock.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.200
And judging by those two holes
in the wall,

22:56.244 --> 22:57.767
he came in shooting.Yeah.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.943
And Ali returned fire
and killed him.

22:59.987 --> 23:02.772
You forgetting about that?You don't know, do you?

23:02.816 --> 23:06.254
They're not after him because
he's violent or dangerous.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.299
They're after him because
he's a dissident

23:08.343 --> 23:09.997
exercising free speech.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.564
And this guy here....

23:11.607 --> 23:14.262
Well, I'm sure he was
here to drag him to his death.

23:14.305 --> 23:17.831
Well, I sympathize
with Ali. I do.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.136
But he's a Saudi national,

23:19.180 --> 23:21.008
and he just killed
a Saudi enforcer.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.923
As far as the U.S. is concerned,

23:22.966 --> 23:24.794
it's an internal Saudi affair.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.057
The United States is
not going to risk

23:27.101 --> 23:29.625
their relationship with
the Kingdom over this.

23:29.669 --> 23:34.064
So Ali is going to be tortured
and executed because of a tweet.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.153
Just so some guys
in a nice office

23:36.197 --> 23:39.635
can shake hands and
have no hard feelings?

23:39.679 --> 23:41.158
Those handshakes keep us off
the precipice

23:41.202 --> 23:42.682
of World War III.

23:42.725 --> 23:46.337
Our economy, our diplomacy,
our national security--

23:46.381 --> 23:47.861
I cannot risk that
by interfering,

23:47.904 --> 23:50.211
and you know it.All the effort,

23:50.254 --> 23:52.126
all the money, all the pain.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.476
Just to stop a kid
from speaking his mind?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.522
Just because
they haven't realized yet

23:56.565 --> 24:00.351
that fear doesn't breed loyalty,
trust does.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.092
Look, if you want
change for tomorrow,

24:02.136 --> 24:04.094
you gotta make
hard choices today.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.009
This is not a hard choice
at all.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.750
Go home, Robyn.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.186
If you wanted to stay
in the game,

24:09.230 --> 24:10.449
you never should have left it.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.105
Ali must have been
using that safe house

24:15.149 --> 24:16.455
to plan his next move.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.847
The apartment had Wi-Fi,

24:17.891 --> 24:19.632
so he must have
been communicating with someone.

24:19.675 --> 24:22.112
Okay, I'll pull all DNS queries
from the last few hours.

24:22.156 --> 24:25.028
Hurry up. If you can do it,
so can the Saudis.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.509
[phone vibrates]

24:28.554 --> 24:30.338
Detective Dante.

24:30.381 --> 24:31.644
Tangling with the Saudis now?

24:31.687 --> 24:33.994
Wow, word travels fast.

24:34.037 --> 24:35.386
All the way to NYPD.

24:35.430 --> 24:38.128
Whatever you're into,
they know you're involved.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.521
They?

24:39.565 --> 24:41.044
There's a new cop on you.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.785
Solid track record
with big fish.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.178
He's not going to stand down.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.659
He knows you're on this,
and he's coming for you.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.399
I'd watch your back.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.925
Thanks for the intel, Detective.

24:53.666 --> 24:54.928
ROBYN:
Word opponents?

24:54.971 --> 24:56.886
Data from the safe house
Wi-Fi says

24:56.930 --> 24:58.540
that this was the site
Ali was on.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.629
So this guy is on the run
from Saudi intelligence,

25:00.673 --> 25:03.066
and he's playing Internet games?MEL: Well, maybe not.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.416
People hooking up sometimes
use this app for affairs

25:05.460 --> 25:06.983
because there's a chat feature

25:07.027 --> 25:09.072
and the messages delete
every time you start a new game.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.987
I've heard.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.687
So he could be using it
to send covert messages.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.732
Well, he left the
apartment in a hurry.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.692
Maybe the game still active.
We just need his user name.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.303
Maybe it's something
the Saudis might not have.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.522
Give me a second.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.438
So this whole, uh, Word
Opponents affair scenario,

25:27.482 --> 25:29.571
you're familiar with that from
personal experience or...

25:29.615 --> 25:32.574
Hey, please. I'm married
to a hacker, okay?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.184
I'd be way more careful
than that.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.925
Mm-hmm. Very good.

25:36.796 --> 25:39.799
Okay, Mira said she and Ali
would play sometimes.

25:39.842 --> 25:43.237
His user name is
lower case ah29.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.588
Okay, I'm in.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.068
And look at this.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.853
Not only is the game active,
Ali just logged on.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.289
Wait, he's talking
to somebody right now?

25:52.333 --> 25:55.031
HARRY: As we speak.
The mystery player

25:55.075 --> 25:56.467
is Whisper99.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.730
Look what they're
saying to him.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.732
"I love you.
We'll get through this.

25:59.775 --> 26:00.863
"I'll take you somewhere

26:00.907 --> 26:02.256
the Flies can't find us."

26:02.299 --> 26:04.606
It's Ali's Juliet, the girl
from the hookah bar.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.955
Looks like they're
running away together.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.870
Yeah, they're meeting
in a parking lot

26:07.914 --> 26:09.219
in Crown Heights in
half an hour.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.657
Yeah, and if the Saudis
get onto this,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.833
he's walking right into
an ambush.

26:24.887 --> 26:28.369
Reza?
Mira sent me.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.805
To help Ali.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.199
That Romeo and Juliet story
you told me.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.159
That wasn't a lie, was it?

26:36.203 --> 26:39.032
But it wasn't
the whole truth, either.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.164
We tried keeping
it from his parents.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.384
But when he started resisting
the arranged marriage...

26:44.167 --> 26:45.734
They found out
he had a boyfriend.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.348
And in our culture...

26:51.392 --> 26:52.915
This is all my fault.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.917
Ali is a loyal Saudi,
but when he heard

26:54.961 --> 26:56.353
about the raid, he told me.

26:57.441 --> 27:00.706
He saved my life.
And now they think he's a Bee.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.533
So he's not a dissident?

27:02.577 --> 27:05.667
No. He just fell in love
with one.

27:07.408 --> 27:10.672
[phone vibrates]

27:10.716 --> 27:11.847
Ali, thank God.
Where are you?

27:11.891 --> 27:14.720
I'm not coming.
They cornered me.

27:14.763 --> 27:15.851
I'm trapped.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.548
Ali, talk to me.
What's going on?

27:17.592 --> 27:19.159
Where is he? Get a location.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.204
Where are you, Ali? You have to
find somewhere to hide.

27:21.248 --> 27:22.945
Anywhere.You remember when we met, Ray?

27:22.989 --> 27:24.947
Ali, please...You called me "kid"

27:24.991 --> 27:26.514
and I pretended to be all mad.[man shouts in distance]

27:26.557 --> 27:28.385
And I turned to you
and I said, "I'm not a kid.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.692
I'm 22 and a half.""I'm 22 and a half."

27:30.736 --> 27:32.825
[chuckles]

27:32.868 --> 27:34.217
And you laughed just like that.

27:34.261 --> 27:35.697
I think I fell in love with you
right then

27:35.741 --> 27:37.438
'cause it was such
a beautiful sound.

27:37.481 --> 27:38.744
[footsteps approaching]

27:41.181 --> 27:42.704
I just wanted to hear it
one more time.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.837
Ali, please...

27:48.579 --> 27:51.452
I love y...[call disconnects]

27:52.148 --> 27:54.324
I have to save him.Reza, listen to me.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.848
You have to let me help.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.980
You can't save him yourself
if they already have him.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.983
I have to, and I know how.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.115
Reza.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.046
Baba.

28:20.089 --> 28:23.353
I had to call on a lifetime
of goodwill with the Kingdom

28:23.397 --> 28:24.485
to be here.

28:24.528 --> 28:27.531
Tell me you're not
who they say you are.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.229
Who do you think I am?

28:31.057 --> 28:34.103
It was him who got
you into this, wasn't it?

28:34.147 --> 28:35.975
The man who poisoned you.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.585
I wasn't poisoned by him.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.369
We fell for each other.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.763
And the Kingdom
that I love--

28:41.807 --> 28:44.723
it would have me kill that
part of myself forever.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.942
They're going to hurt you.

28:46.986 --> 28:50.032
They're going to torture you
and execute you.

28:51.512 --> 28:55.081
You are no dissident.
You were simply misled by one.

28:55.124 --> 28:58.606
And you need to give
him up to save yourself.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.303
If you do...

29:02.218 --> 29:03.698
...I can get you home.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.831
But if you don't, I-I

29:05.874 --> 29:08.529
can't stop
what's about to happen.

29:15.405 --> 29:18.104
My name is Reza Shaheen.
By now you may have heard

29:18.147 --> 29:19.758
Saudi intelligence
has captured your son.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.107
Mom, is that true?

29:21.150 --> 29:23.239
They think Ali is a
dissident, but he's not.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.589
And I want them to take me
in exchange for his life.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.243
Why? Who are you?

29:29.202 --> 29:30.725
The man Ali is protecting.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.773
He has never defied
the Kingdom except to save me.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.035
But he will never
give up my name.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.427
not even under the pain
of torture.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.909
Because you're the one
he's in love with?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.566
I came here and not
the embassy because

29:45.609 --> 29:48.438
if you turn me in, it can
buy your family goodwill.

29:48.482 --> 29:51.877
And what makes you think
they will exchange Ali for you?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.967
Because I'm Dissident X.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.665
I'll admit to that,
and tell them

29:57.708 --> 29:59.667
I forced Ali to help me.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.625
But they'll kill you.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.628
I'll die knowing
your brother will live.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.241
I'm calling the embassy.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.678
ROBYN:
Please don't.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.420
There's another way
to save your son.

30:13.463 --> 30:14.421
Who are you?

30:14.464 --> 30:16.205
I'm someone who specializes

30:16.249 --> 30:17.424
in these situations.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.556
I can end this
and make sure that

30:19.600 --> 30:22.429
both young men
come out of it alive.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.605
This is not your business,

30:24.648 --> 30:26.650
and nobody here
asked for your help.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.348
I did.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.306
When you wouldn't talk to me,
I asked her to find out

30:30.350 --> 30:32.613
what was going on with Ali,
to save him.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.224
You bring a stranger
into our affairs?

30:35.268 --> 30:37.226
You disrespect your father.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.706
I have been the dutiful daughter
my whole life,

30:38.749 --> 30:41.448
but if you won't help Ali,
then someone has to try.

30:41.491 --> 30:42.710
What are you talking about?

30:42.753 --> 30:44.233
We're trying to help
your brother.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.931
Mira, let her.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.671
This is not what he wants.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.023
This is the man he loves.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.372
He's trying to protect him.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.895
If you turn Reza in
to be murdered,

30:53.939 --> 30:57.203
you'll be saving Ali,
but you'll be losing a son.

30:57.246 --> 31:00.684
Kindness is a mark of faith.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.731
ROBYN:
One hour.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.733
Just give me one hour.

31:13.001 --> 31:16.048
Please...
give them his name.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.093
This man--

31:18.137 --> 31:20.400
he's going
to get you killed, Ali.

31:20.443 --> 31:23.272
And you work for the government
that'll do it.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.188
[door opens]

31:29.191 --> 31:30.410
It's time.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.980
Baba?Ali, please.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.982
Ali, please, just
give them his name.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.462
His name.

31:41.638 --> 31:42.857
Baba...

31:42.901 --> 31:44.424
Baba, don't let
them do this.

31:46.382 --> 31:49.690
Baba?Please.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.562
Don't let them do this, please.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.219
Baba.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.576
Baba!

32:08.143 --> 32:09.579
[line ringing]

32:09.623 --> 32:11.451
BISHOP: McCall, what's up?Don't talk, just listen.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.670
Well, that's a great way
to start a conversation.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.542
You must know where
they're holding an Ali.

32:15.585 --> 32:18.675
Now, what if I were to tell you
that we could save him

32:18.719 --> 32:20.199
and you could end up in
a better position

32:20.242 --> 32:21.983
with the Kingdom
than you are now?

32:22.027 --> 32:23.898
I'd tell you to get
more sleep.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.465
Ali doesn't have that much time.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.467
And the NYPD is back on my tail.

32:27.510 --> 32:31.123
So I need to know if you're
coming off the sidelines now.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.041
Got something?

32:36.084 --> 32:37.912
Location of the vigilante.
Saudis just called it in.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.087
Mind if I ride along?Sorry.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.088
Don't want anything
between me

32:40.132 --> 32:41.785
and putting her in cuffs.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.709
[grunts]

32:52.753 --> 32:54.973
[panting]

32:55.016 --> 32:56.365
Are you tired, Ali?

32:56.409 --> 32:58.237
Tired of lying?

32:58.280 --> 32:59.978
Tired of fighting?

33:00.021 --> 33:01.849
This can end.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.459
Just give me the names.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.114
No.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.467
[gasps]

33:11.511 --> 33:13.687
[whimpering]Speak!

33:13.730 --> 33:15.341
Aah! No! No!

33:15.384 --> 33:17.082
This is your last chance.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.040
Please, no, no.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.607
Speak!

33:22.043 --> 33:23.914
BISHOP:
Shakir.

33:28.658 --> 33:31.270
What are you doing here?Trying to save your ass.

33:31.313 --> 33:34.447
There's been a leak.
The CIA is onto you.

33:34.490 --> 33:35.448
This is not your concern.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.015
I'm on retainer with you.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.234
Your concerns
are my concerns

33:39.278 --> 33:42.281
Interrogating him here
could cause problems for you.

33:42.324 --> 33:43.456
What do you suggest?

33:44.196 --> 33:45.588
We're gonna take him
out of here.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.025
Now, I have a place.
I'll take Ali,

33:47.068 --> 33:48.504
you're gonna meet us there.

33:48.548 --> 33:49.853
I'm going with the prisoner.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.117
You're very heavy
on the radar right now.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.380
If you get detained,
every news outlet

33:54.423 --> 33:55.816
leads with this story
in the morning.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.339
It's Khashoggi all over again.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.908
Cultural firestorm.
Billions lost in sanctions.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.562
Partnerships.
Relationships.

34:02.605 --> 34:05.260
I don't think that's a good
idea for you or your country.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.441
I'm not letting this traitor
out of my sight.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.056
[door bangs open]MAN: Move, move!

34:18.099 --> 34:19.753
Go, go, go!Hands! Show me your hands!

34:19.796 --> 34:21.059
NYPD.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.799
MALLORY:
Where is she?

34:29.545 --> 34:31.243
OFFICER:
Let's go.

34:33.462 --> 34:36.987
Congratulations, Detective.
Quite a bust.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.641
Heard you saved the kid.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.078
Except no one's gonna
know about it.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.905
Whole thing's with
the State Department now.

34:42.819 --> 34:45.518
You knew, didn't you,

34:45.561 --> 34:47.128
that she wouldn't be there?

34:47.172 --> 34:49.957
That's why you wanted to come--
to see the look on my face.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.177
She's never seen
unless she wants to be.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.657
Tip like that is a clear setup

34:54.701 --> 34:56.442
for the part she can't do.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.096
The part where
people have to get arrested.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.010
Well, I can play games, too.

35:00.054 --> 35:01.186
This was round one.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.318
I'm just getting started.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.372
Ali!

35:17.724 --> 35:19.813
You saved me.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.816
ROBYN:After some high-level
diplomatic discussions,

35:22.859 --> 35:24.426
Saudi intelligence has agreed

35:24.470 --> 35:26.994
that they will never
go after Ali again.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.604
He's safe, he's free.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.610
But... he can never

35:34.654 --> 35:37.047
return to Saudi Arabia again.

35:42.879 --> 35:45.230
Good news is you won't be alone.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.016
Hey, kid.Oh...

35:52.193 --> 35:54.543
Oh, I can't believe my
parents didn't turn you in.

35:56.502 --> 35:57.938
I owe them my life.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.594
This was their last act of love.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.743
A Saudi diplomat like him
cannot have a son like me.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.877
They're sending us back.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.445
So this is goodbye for me, too.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.277
I'm forbidden from
ever seeing you again.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.024
Change is coming.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.463
Maybe someday.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.447
[indistinct chatter]

37:12.491 --> 37:13.753
There are a million
other bars

37:13.796 --> 37:14.797
in the city, you know.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.452
Hmm. What are the odds?

37:17.496 --> 37:20.150
Maybe we should
become drinking buddies.

37:20.194 --> 37:22.457
Hmm. Let's not, though.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.765
I don't love
my worlds colliding.Yeah, well,

37:25.808 --> 37:29.812
I'm not the one who
keeps showing up unannounced.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.684
I don't think she likes me.

37:31.727 --> 37:34.556
[short chuckle]
You have that effect on women.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.471
[chuckles]

37:36.515 --> 37:38.343
By the way, that was
some fancy dancing you did

37:38.386 --> 37:41.128
with the State Department.

37:41.171 --> 37:43.478
Well, it ain't the
Iran nuclear deal, but

37:43.522 --> 37:46.002
the Saudis won't go after Ali.
However, we're gonna have to

37:46.046 --> 37:49.702
sweep that abduction and torture
under the rug. You know that.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.139
It avoids a major
diplomatic incident

37:52.182 --> 37:53.967
for everyone, so...

37:54.010 --> 37:55.925
But the good news
is the CIA

37:55.969 --> 37:59.973
loves the fact that the
Saudis owe me a favor

38:00.016 --> 38:01.627
for cleaning up their mess.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.369
You want to front like
that's why you did it,

38:04.412 --> 38:06.936
when the truth is
you have never been able

38:06.980 --> 38:09.722
to resist a good love story.

38:09.765 --> 38:10.853
Oh.Mm-hmm.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.812
Well, they usually end better.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.814
Hey, Ali may be free,

38:14.857 --> 38:18.339
but that immunity deal
doesn't cover Reza.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.341
He starts up that
Dissident X stuff,

38:20.385 --> 38:21.951
and they're gonna
come after him again.

38:21.995 --> 38:22.952
I promise you.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.738
Maybe he lied to save Ali.

38:25.781 --> 38:29.394
Maybe Dissident X
is not even a person at all.

38:29.437 --> 38:33.354
See, that's what oppressors
have never understood, Bish.

38:33.398 --> 38:36.009
You can't kill an idea.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.141
[short chuckle]

38:38.185 --> 38:41.231
And I'm gonna make
sure to tell 'em that.

38:43.059 --> 38:44.626
This is a nice place
you got here.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.369
Your secret is
safe with me.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.116
He didn't pay for that,
you know.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.900
[laughs]

38:57.944 --> 38:59.772
Come down for a drink?

38:59.815 --> 39:04.385
No. I have an even bigger crisis
waiting for me at home.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.213
I'll see you.Okay.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.051
[gasps]
Hey.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.574
Are you cheating on me?

39:19.618 --> 39:22.577
Oh, man, I'm so sorry
you had to find out this way.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.579
Well, what's Zaki
have that I don't?

39:24.623 --> 39:26.842
Well, it turns out
that nearly getting shot

39:26.886 --> 39:29.323
in an alley is a real turn-on
for me, so... [clicks tongue]

39:29.367 --> 39:31.543
Huh. I'll keep that in mind.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.458
[chuckles]

39:33.501 --> 39:35.895
Can I fin...Yeah, you can finish.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.810
Have you lost your mind?
Are you really gonna

39:37.853 --> 39:39.028
let her go to this concert?

39:39.072 --> 39:41.422
No.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.293
But I don't want
to confront her.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.512
I think she might come clean.

39:44.556 --> 39:45.905
I just want to
give her a chance.

39:45.948 --> 39:49.430
She's had months to do
that, Robyn, and she hasn't.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.432
And where the two of you are
right now...

39:51.476 --> 39:52.912
There was no trust in
the house of the person

39:52.955 --> 39:56.611
I was helping today,
and it nearly cost him his life.

39:56.655 --> 39:59.397
What this house needs is trust.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.749
So... I'm gonna give her mine.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.707
[vehicle approaches]Maybe she'll do the same.

40:05.751 --> 40:06.882
[horn honks]

40:06.926 --> 40:10.146
Here she comes,
our little spelunker.

40:11.887 --> 40:12.975
You all set?

40:13.019 --> 40:16.152
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:18.328 --> 40:21.331
Are you okay?Excited?

40:21.375 --> 40:22.724
Yeah, I guess.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.639
It's really
not that big of a deal.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.598
What are you talking about?
It's a huge deal.

40:26.641 --> 40:29.078
You're trying
something new.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.124
Come on, co... come here,

40:31.167 --> 40:33.561
give me a hug.
I'm proud of you.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.003
Thanks, Mom.
[short chuckle]

40:41.047 --> 40:43.528
Okay, well, I'll see you.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.660
Wait.

40:49.925 --> 40:52.406
Just in case.

40:56.410 --> 40:59.152
I'll call you when I get there.

40:59.195 --> 41:01.633
Okay.
Love you, babe.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.591
Love you.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.027
Bye.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.681
[door closes]

41:11.512 --> 41:13.471
Just wanted to know
where I stood.

41:13.514 --> 41:16.648
I know you wanted her
to take a step towards you,

41:16.691 --> 41:19.868
and she will,
at her own pace.

41:19.912 --> 41:22.915
Just... give it time.

41:26.005 --> 41:28.703
Now go save that child
from herself.

41:28.747 --> 41:30.444
[sighs]

41:33.055 --> 41:34.404
You going somewhere?

41:34.448 --> 41:37.451
Uh, hey. Yeah.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.192
Aunt Vi and I were about

41:39.235 --> 41:41.194
to... go get

41:41.237 --> 41:43.196
some frozen yogurt.

41:43.239 --> 41:45.633
Did you forget
something?

41:45.677 --> 41:46.852
No, no.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.549
No, um...

41:50.377 --> 41:52.466
I need to tell you
