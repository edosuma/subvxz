20:07.600 --> 20:10.080
That's them. Okay.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.888
Well, doesn't that look nice?

(MOBILE BEEPS)

20:18.520 --> 20:19.442
Okay.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.409
Instead of mending this fence,

20:21.480 --> 20:24.450
I'm going to take this clay oven.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.606
Look at this guy, he's going to starve
our kids.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.771
I need the lab.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.329
It's Rachel's turn for protein testing.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.404
Blood, urinalysis.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.761
What?

21:10.080 --> 21:12.401
- What is it?
- SCOTT: Uh, board game.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.681

Oh.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.401

21:20.320 --> 21:21.765
Medieval farm building?

21:22.200 --> 21:23.531
I'm so

21:24.920 --> 21:25.921
bored.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.967
DELPHINE: Well,

21:27.960 --> 21:29.086
you want to?

21:29.520 --> 21:31.921
Sure. I mean, yeah.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.409
Maybe start without the expansions.

COSIMA: Sorry, dude.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.445
Felix, I can't see anything.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.921
FELIX: Oh, Jesus Christ.
You need to relax, okay?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.684
I know Alison's got a cactus up
her arse,

21:44.760 --> 21:45.886
but you're over clinching.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.405
I can't see anything, Felix.

here's Alison Hendrix.

21:58.920 --> 21:59.887
She's here.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.962
Line up for a picture with
your future school trustee.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.326
Who's up first, hmm? How about you?

22:03.760 --> 22:05.524
Come embrace Alison,
and throw your arms around her.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.886

you never had or always wanted,

22:09.120 --> 22:10.406
or something like that.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.926
All right. Big smiles. Bigger, okay?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.646
We want to see those teeth gleam
in the lens.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.529
It's gonna be brilliant,
it's gonna be fantastic.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.568
Alison, we got a problem.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.880
What?

22:20.960 --> 22:23.884
Your husband gave these
to Pouchy instead of the money.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.007
No. no, no, no, no.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.366
He gave them the wrong envelope?

22:26.440 --> 22:27.601
Yeah. You know, seriously,

22:27.680 --> 22:29.523
maybe you shouldn't mix business
and marriage.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.441
ALISON: Oh, God.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.530
The money's up there.

Okay, okay. Know what? Go, go, go, go.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.609
Where is Donnie? Is he in danger?

22:49.400 --> 22:51.129
Short answer, yeah.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.566
I'm gonna switch these envelopes,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.165
you go wait outside.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.169
FELIX: I think we can get the smiles
even bigger than that.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.481
I think that we can just drive
those cheeks up

What are you doing here?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.529
I need to tell you something
very important.

You wait here, and I'll be right back.

No. no, no, no, no, no.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.442
- This cannot wait.
- What is it?

23:40.040 --> 23:44.489
Now, wasn't this your Home Ec class?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.210
It's family sciences now, but yes.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.408
Oh, you know what? The last time
I was in here,

23:48.600 --> 23:51.490
you were in tears
because you only got 82 in cooking.

Mom, talk!

23:53.280 --> 23:54.611
(SIGHS)

23:54.680 --> 23:57.684
You said I didn't think
your father was good enough.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.171
And it's time for you to know the truth.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.207
He wasn't.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.164
I mean, you know we had to conceive you
in vitro

24:02.240 --> 24:03.241
because of his low motility.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.970
I can't listen to this right now.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.520
I wanted better stock for my child,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.369
so I engaged the clinic to provide
an upgrade.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.370
A competitive swimmer, Jewish, blonde,
oddly.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.289
Wait. Dad...

24:17.480 --> 24:19.323
Well, why tell him?

24:19.680 --> 24:21.205
I mean, my point is,

24:21.280 --> 24:24.363
if I seem disappointed in
your life choices,

24:24.760 --> 24:27.445
it's only because I tried to give you

24:27.520 --> 24:30.524
every opportunity from day one.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.205
You need to wait here.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.841
(WHISPERING) Hey, hey.
Did you get the money?

24:40.920 --> 24:42.445
No, he's getting it. I've been ambushed.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.521
Would you...

24:43.600 --> 24:45.090
Would you entertain my mother
for a second?

24:45.160 --> 24:46.730
- Just keep her away from the mixer.
- All right.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.725
Okay, guys, it looks like Mrs. Hendrix
is all done.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.041
Thank you very much. Full schedule.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.730
She's in Mrs. Green's room, okay?

24:53.800 --> 24:55.086
Thank you.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.491
You owe me.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.125
You owe me Alison pee.

(EXHALES DEEPLY) Okay, okay, okay.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.841
Well, um, we'll hide you in the loo,

25:02.920 --> 25:04.365
and then I'll bring Alison in afterwards

25:04.440 --> 25:05.930
when the time's right, yeah?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.606
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.331
SCOTT: Okay, you are a medieval farmer.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.610
Each turn, you get two choices
to build your farm,

25:14.680 --> 25:16.603
one for you and one for your spouse.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.123
You can build fences, plant crops,
have children.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.725
Not seriously.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.883
Oh, yes. This is how we do it, Rachel.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.610
Anyone comes in, we're farm-building.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.969
Now, there are 14 game rounds and
six stages,

25:34.040 --> 25:35.769
with a harvest at the end of each stage.

Look, you're safe.
Um, Cosima's in the bathroom,

25:40.640 --> 25:41.880
but she really needs your piss.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.961
- Okay.
- Okay. Well, these...

25:43.040 --> 25:43.962
These are my campaign signatures.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.405
We accidentally gave Sarah Stubbs

25:45.520 --> 25:47.602
an envelope with 30,000 cash in it.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.001
What?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.767
Alison, what is going on?

25:55.040 --> 25:57.202
You know what? I quit.
This is ridiculous.

ALISON: No, no, no, no. Felix, Felix.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.287
Okay, okay.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.360
(WHISPERING) We're drug dealers.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.804
Donnie and I are dealing pills.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.206
And we mixed up the envelopes

26:08.280 --> 26:11.204
and now he's being held
captive by some man called Pouchy.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.206
Pouchy?

26:13.280 --> 26:15.681
Pouchy, as in the crime lord
that cut off Vic's finger?

26:16.800 --> 26:17.801
Maybe.

There are not two Pouchys, darling.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.286
I'm confident that we will get past
this,

26:29.560 --> 26:31.210
and we will make a lot of money
together.

seriously.

No, he'll get the money. He will!

26:52.440 --> 26:53.726
He'll get it!

26:53.960 --> 26:55.325
I'm going there myself.

a friend here who's a casting director,

27:06.880 --> 27:08.644
and I really think you two should meet.

- Really? Okay.

- Yes.

under the wire?

(STUTTERING) No, what kind
of accusation is that?

27:32.800 --> 27:34.529
Well, maybe you don't have enough
signatures.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.251
I have plenty of signatures.

to do your sound check?

27:38.480 --> 27:39.970

27:40.040 --> 27:42.486
How are you at public speaking now?

27:42.560 --> 27:44.403

27:44.480 --> 27:45.686

the sale of Bubbles.

Oh, the offer just wasn't up to snuff.

that I see.
