00:01.143 --> 00:02.693
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:03.128 --> 00:05.192
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:06.022 --> 00:07.465
Do I tell Lucy about Paul?

00:07.466 --> 00:09.145
- No!
- He's her father!

00:09.146 --> 00:11.187
Who she thinks is dead, April.

00:11.188 --> 00:12.943
But he's not.

00:12.943 --> 00:14.412
Wait, Harry is...

00:14.413 --> 00:16.085
He is the new head chef!

00:16.085 --> 00:17.797
You do an awful lot for this guy.

00:17.798 --> 00:21.268
My God. You're not worried
about Harry and me...

00:21.269 --> 00:22.632
Should I be?

00:22.633 --> 00:23.825
Your release from the hospital

00:23.826 --> 00:26.403
is dependent on your willingness
to accept treatment.

00:26.404 --> 00:27.216
So what?

00:27.217 --> 00:28.595
You tricked me into telling you the truth,

00:28.596 --> 00:29.874
and now I'm just stuck here?

00:29.875 --> 00:31.292
- Please, Anna...
- Just go!

00:32.218 --> 00:34.607
So, you had no idea
the woman Jacob's been seeing

00:34.608 --> 00:36.034
is your patient?

00:36.369 --> 00:37.660
Good night, Karen.

00:49.045 --> 00:50.057
Anna.

00:52.203 --> 00:53.269
I wasn't expecting you.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.997
W-w-what's going on?

00:54.998 --> 00:57.127
I'll... I'll give you two a moment.

00:57.128 --> 00:59.570
This is not what it looks like.

00:59.571 --> 01:00.682
Let's go upstairs.

01:00.683 --> 01:02.258
How do you know him?

01:02.259 --> 01:04.205
This is all just a terrible coincidence.

01:04.206 --> 01:05.783
Jacob and I used to work together.

01:05.784 --> 01:07.296
Do you still work together?

01:07.297 --> 01:08.523
No.

01:08.524 --> 01:10.249
So...

01:10.250 --> 01:11.602
What was he doing here?

01:11.603 --> 01:13.693
We're friends.

01:14.759 --> 01:16.043
Friends?

01:17.427 --> 01:20.241
Anna, please, let's go upstairs and talk.

01:20.242 --> 01:21.532
Did you know we were dating?

01:22.293 --> 01:23.120
Yes.

01:23.121 --> 01:24.604
How long?

01:25.611 --> 01:27.128
How long have you known?

01:27.129 --> 01:28.210
Just a few days.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.426
So...

01:32.431 --> 01:34.209
Are you the reason he broke up with me?

01:38.552 --> 01:40.205
Right.

01:40.206 --> 01:41.626
Okay.

01:55.635 --> 01:58.060
O-o-okay.

01:58.061 --> 01:59.084
Okay, you people are scavengers!

02:02.271 --> 02:03.606
Hi.

02:03.607 --> 02:04.788
Hey.

02:07.801 --> 02:09.618
I missed all the good stuff.

02:09.619 --> 02:12.483
No, there's, you know,
there's one blueberry left.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.183
You can have it.

02:14.184 --> 02:16.575
Really, it's... it's yours.

02:25.871 --> 02:27.657
Hello?! Are you even listening to me?!

02:27.658 --> 02:29.561
We only have a few weeks
until the soft open,

02:29.562 --> 02:31.336
which, I might add, officially marks

02:31.337 --> 02:33.206
the longest that I've been
employed all year,

02:33.207 --> 02:35.143
and I would really like
to keep it that way,

02:35.144 --> 02:36.436
so please, for the love of God, Harry,

02:36.437 --> 02:38.271
tell me that you've finally
decided on what you're cooking.

02:38.272 --> 02:39.584
<i>I have.</i>

02:39.585 --> 02:40.973
Okay.

02:40.974 --> 02:42.870
<i>The curried quail!</i>

02:42.871 --> 02:43.740
Perfect.

02:43.741 --> 02:45.029
So, we'll pair that
with a nice light red...

02:45.030 --> 02:46.970
<i>Or the braised rabbit.</i>

02:46.971 --> 02:49.062
Okay, so T.B.D., then?

02:49.063 --> 02:51.941
Indecision is not a good look
on you, by the way!

02:53.367 --> 02:55.964
I need to see what cuts
I can get my hands on.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.217
Um...

03:04.496 --> 03:05.612
What was I saying?

03:05.613 --> 03:07.384
Then so, do you want this to be

03:07.385 --> 03:10.223
a, a walk-through or a, seated dinner?

03:10.224 --> 03:12.431
Curried quail is not finger food.

03:14.038 --> 03:15.381
What'd you say?

03:15.382 --> 03:16.915
Now, let's do a served meal,
three courses.

03:16.916 --> 03:20.508
I'm thinking
a rustic pumpkin-cayenne soup.

03:20.509 --> 03:22.639
Pumpkin-cayenne soup... perfect.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.970
Sounds great!

03:24.971 --> 03:26.107
What are you doing?

03:27.538 --> 03:29.079
You're sitting on my wallet.

03:29.080 --> 03:29.915
You okay?

03:29.916 --> 03:31.156
Yeah I'm fine.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.305
We just... we have a lot of work to do.

03:32.306 --> 03:33.237
Let's try to focus.

03:33.238 --> 03:34.217
Lucky the party's not tomorrow night.

03:34.218 --> 03:35.254
Now, I don't know what you think,

03:35.255 --> 03:36.486
but I'd prefer printed menus.

03:36.487 --> 03:38.765
Well, I'd prefer a shirt on!

03:39.117 --> 03:40.538
Right. I'm sorry.

03:40.539 --> 03:42.630
Didn't realize we were
suddenly so professional.

03:42.631 --> 03:44.305
No, it's just... it's...
We're in a meeting here,

03:44.306 --> 03:46.008
and you're dripping all over me, dude.

03:46.009 --> 03:47.523
Okay, boss, hold your horses.

03:48.954 --> 03:50.086
I'm excited, Joss.

03:50.087 --> 03:51.058
I haven't felt like this

03:51.059 --> 03:52.544
since the opening of Savannah's Kitchen,

03:52.545 --> 03:54.449
and it is all thanks to you.

03:57.286 --> 03:58.357
You're a champion.

03:58.392 --> 03:59.066
You too.

04:22.236 --> 04:23.094
Hello?

04:23.095 --> 04:24.556
<i>April, it's Paul.</i>

04:26.460 --> 04:27.819
Please don't hang up.

04:27.820 --> 04:30.140
I thought I told you
never to call me again.

04:30.141 --> 04:32.660
I know. It's about Lucy.

04:33.377 --> 04:35.345
What? What did... what...

04:35.346 --> 04:36.996
I'm in trouble. And it's serious.

04:36.997 --> 04:38.269
What kind of trouble?

04:38.270 --> 04:40.441
I got mixed up with some bad people.

04:40.442 --> 04:42.553
There's a chance that I may have to...

04:44.327 --> 04:45.637
Serve jail time.

04:45.638 --> 04:47.057
Jail time!?

04:47.058 --> 04:48.161
April, listen.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.325
If that happens, it'll be on the news.

04:51.483 --> 04:53.355
So I wanted you to know
so you had time to figure out

04:53.356 --> 04:55.220
what you were gonna tell Lucy.

04:57.057 --> 04:58.381
You know what?

04:58.382 --> 04:59.658
Um, d-don't... don't do anything.

04:59.659 --> 05:02.776
I, um... just give me 48 hours
to figure this out, okay?

05:02.777 --> 05:04.340
And then I promise I'll call you back.

05:04.341 --> 05:05.331
No, wait!

05:05.332 --> 05:06.417
Sorry. I got to go.

05:10.082 --> 05:11.075
Who was that?

05:11.076 --> 05:14.282
Nobody, sweetie... wrong number.

05:14.283 --> 05:15.958
Okay.

05:27.541 --> 05:28.720
Joss?!

05:29.929 --> 05:31.234
Stephanie!

05:31.235 --> 05:33.552
My God! How are you?!

05:33.553 --> 05:34.967
I haven't seen you
in like a hundred years!

05:34.968 --> 05:36.682
How have you been? What are you up to?

05:36.683 --> 05:38.280
A few hair-color changes,

05:38.281 --> 05:39.612
some questionable I.V.F. Treatments...

05:39.613 --> 05:41.252
And a divorce on my end.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.360
I'm sorry. I heard about you and Jason.

05:43.361 --> 05:44.668
You guys were such a cool couple.

05:44.669 --> 05:46.762
Yeah, well...

05:46.763 --> 05:49.018
What about you?
Are the Facebook rumors true?

05:49.019 --> 05:50.199
Are you in a relationship?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.338
Yes, I am. I am officially cohabitating.

05:52.339 --> 05:54.079
That's amazing!

05:54.080 --> 05:55.112
How did you even meet?

05:55.113 --> 05:56.809
I feel like it's so impossible
in this city.

05:56.810 --> 05:57.753
It is.

05:57.754 --> 05:59.611
You know, we actually met
at a leukemia gala.

05:59.612 --> 06:02.424
Charity! Why didn't I think of that?

06:02.425 --> 06:04.248
He doesn't have
any single friends, does he?

06:04.249 --> 06:06.221
No, I don't think so...

06:06.222 --> 06:08.531
My...

06:08.532 --> 06:10.062
But you know what? I do.

06:10.063 --> 06:10.975
He's perfect for you.

06:10.976 --> 06:12.716
He's tall, he's blond,
and he's just recently divorced.

06:12.717 --> 06:14.073
I'm gonna send you his info right now.

06:14.074 --> 06:14.959
- S-seriously?
- Yeah.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.735
That would be great. Thank you so much!

06:19.200 --> 06:20.899
I'm coming.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.407
Sorry, I-I got to go, Steph,
but I'll call you later.

06:22.408 --> 06:22.957
Yes, please.

06:23.368 --> 06:23.965
Mwah! I was so good to see you!

06:24.291 --> 06:25.055
- Amazing, amazing!
- Amazing.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.144
- Call him!
- Okay.

06:28.831 --> 06:29.706
Do you have the defendant's statements?

06:29.707 --> 06:32.206
Page three, but you should take a look

06:32.207 --> 06:34.719
because our witness seems to be
implicating herself.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.922
Yep, I see it.

06:38.612 --> 06:40.217
Good work, Toni.

06:41.386 --> 06:42.728
Thank you!

06:44.927 --> 06:45.731
What?

06:45.732 --> 06:47.230
You haven't said that in a while.

06:49.514 --> 06:50.988
Antonia Ruiz?

06:51.227 --> 06:53.590
Whoa.

06:53.591 --> 06:54.763
Sign here, please.

06:55.817 --> 06:56.887
Thank you.

06:56.922 --> 06:57.958
New boyfriend?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.960
<i>Aye, qu√©? Would you be jealous?</i>

07:02.480 --> 07:03.796
I'm only kidding.

07:05.546 --> 07:06.925
So, what's going on with you and Savannah?

07:06.926 --> 07:07.862
You guys back together yet?

07:11.537 --> 07:12.617
You know, let's... let's keep going.

07:12.618 --> 07:14.472
We've got a lot to cover before
this afternoon's meetings.

07:14.473 --> 07:15.943
Whatever you say, boss.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.403
Paul is officially the worst, hands down.

07:24.943 --> 07:25.954
What do you think he did?

07:25.955 --> 07:27.129
I have no idea.

07:27.130 --> 07:28.577
I hardly got a word in edgewise.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.134
He just told me
he got in with some bad people

07:30.135 --> 07:32.390
and to think about
what I want to tell Lucy

07:32.391 --> 07:33.696
in case he's on the news.

07:33.697 --> 07:36.307
- On the news?!
- What are you supposed to tell Lucy?

07:36.308 --> 07:38.863
I don't know. Everything?

07:38.864 --> 07:40.892
- She's much too young. Are you crazy?!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

07:40.893 --> 07:41.907
Okay, fine.

07:41.908 --> 07:44.461
What, you think
I should just keep lying to her?

07:47.170 --> 07:48.750
Okay, am I the only person that thinks

07:48.751 --> 07:50.575
that maybe Paul's using this
as an opportunity

07:50.576 --> 07:52.328
to slither his way back into your life?

07:52.329 --> 07:54.363
I mean, h-how do you even know
that he's really in trouble?

07:54.364 --> 07:58.292
Because he sounded scared. Really scared.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.673
What is it?

08:02.674 --> 08:04.257
I'm just wondering.

08:04.258 --> 08:05.846
Do you think whoever's looking for Paul,

08:05.847 --> 08:07.767
could they be after me next?

08:10.253 --> 08:11.097
All right, so, he said

08:11.098 --> 08:12.055
he's gonna call you again, right?

08:13.461 --> 08:14.475
So we just wait.

08:16.975 --> 08:18.138
We wait.

08:26.841 --> 08:27.904
- Hey!
- Hey!

08:28.439 --> 08:29.385
Did we have plans?

08:29.386 --> 08:30.900
No, but Scott's working late,

08:30.901 --> 08:32.365
and I can't stop thinking about April.

08:32.366 --> 08:33.581
I want to buy her a pony.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.587
Please try not to do that.

08:36.693 --> 08:37.597
Well, we could go halfsies.

08:37.597 --> 08:39.183
What, are you working?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.864
Costa Rica? When do we leave?

08:43.865 --> 08:46.212
You, my love, are not invited.

08:46.213 --> 08:47.980
This is for me and Dom.

08:47.981 --> 08:50.294
Did you guys get back together?

08:50.495 --> 08:55.861
No, but this morning,
he gave me his muffin!

08:57.084 --> 08:58.939
I don't know what that means.

08:58.940 --> 09:01.051
He loves blueberry muffins,

09:01.052 --> 09:03.768
so much so that I once saw him
try to trip an associate

09:03.769 --> 09:05.592
to get to the last blueberry muffin.

09:05.593 --> 09:08.276
And this morning, he gave it to me.

09:08.277 --> 09:10.928
So that means
he's ready to get back together.

09:10.929 --> 09:12.256
Exactly!

09:12.257 --> 09:14.421
I'm so glad you're not reading
too much into this.

09:14.422 --> 09:15.860
Yep, a couple of weeks ago,

09:15.861 --> 09:17.124
he wanted to have a baby with me,

09:17.125 --> 09:18.919
and today he was very smiley

09:18.920 --> 09:21.343
and extremely generous with baked goods.

09:25.062 --> 09:27.133
Well, if that's what you really want.

09:28.978 --> 09:31.472
Well, then, honey, I'm sure you'll get it.

09:31.473 --> 09:32.421
You always do.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.239
Sorry, I'm late.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.631
No, I'm glad you came.

09:43.632 --> 09:46.266
When I didn't hear from you,
I wasn't sure...

09:46.267 --> 09:47.766
I would have been here sooner,

09:47.767 --> 09:49.559
but the line at Starbucks was
out of control.

09:50.587 --> 09:52.029
Anna.

09:52.642 --> 09:53.496
About last night...

09:54.097 --> 09:55.839
You know what?
I'd rather not talk about it.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.837
I'm fine.

09:56.838 --> 09:58.349
We're fine.

09:59.350 --> 10:02.208
All right, then there is
something I'd like to discuss.

10:02.209 --> 10:03.519
Go for it.

10:05.516 --> 10:08.024
The other week,
when you missed our session,

10:08.025 --> 10:11.252
I was worried about you,
so I went to your house.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.408
To make sure you were safe.

10:16.327 --> 10:19.645
I don't know why you would
misrepresent yourself like that.

10:19.646 --> 10:21.399
I didn't misrepresent myself.

10:23.004 --> 10:24.678
I lied to you.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.348
I said I lived in Beverly Hills,
and I don't.

10:27.349 --> 10:28.448
So what? Big deal.

10:28.449 --> 10:30.618
It's not the lie that's a big deal.

10:30.619 --> 10:32.252
It's just that I don't understand...

10:32.253 --> 10:33.246
Just so you know...

10:35.399 --> 10:36.621
I lied about everything.

10:36.622 --> 10:38.753
The whole escort thing? Never happened.

10:38.754 --> 10:40.494
That's not what I did for a living.

10:40.495 --> 10:41.678
That's not why I...

10:43.249 --> 10:44.656
Why you tried to kill yourself?

10:44.657 --> 10:46.345
I'm not a whore.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.548
That's just a story I made up.
One of many.

10:48.549 --> 10:49.768
But why?

10:49.769 --> 10:51.961
Why would you waste
our time here together?

10:51.962 --> 10:53.584
Because I don't want to tell you my story!

10:53.585 --> 10:55.299
Then what have you been doing here?!

10:55.300 --> 10:56.840
You made me come here!

10:56.841 --> 10:58.917
You wouldn't discharge me
from the hospital

10:58.918 --> 11:00.463
unless I agreed to these sessions!

11:00.464 --> 11:01.551
That night,

11:01.552 --> 11:03.259
you got me to tell you the truth
about what happened,

11:03.260 --> 11:05.027
but as soon I was honest with you,

11:05.028 --> 11:06.698
you tried to pawn me off
on another doctor!

11:06.699 --> 11:08.609
But I called you. I...

11:08.610 --> 11:10.200
Only after you'd already tricked me!

11:10.201 --> 11:12.280
You seemed like a dishonest person.

11:12.281 --> 11:14.551
Turns out my instincts were right.

11:18.097 --> 11:19.546
So, Karen...

11:20.147 --> 11:22.198
What should we talk about now?

11:30.855 --> 11:32.416
It's your own personal stash.

11:33.743 --> 11:35.673
Well, um, thank you.

11:35.674 --> 11:37.862
Let's go to Costa Rica together.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.433
W-w-what?

11:39.434 --> 11:40.465
I'm sorry.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.726
I-I-I-I practiced
how I was gonna say that,

11:42.727 --> 11:45.554
a-and that totally just was not it.

11:47.812 --> 11:50.420
But I-I have been looking at flights.

11:50.421 --> 11:52.020
You... you want to go on a vacation?

11:52.021 --> 11:52.873
Yeah, you always said

11:52.874 --> 11:54.140
it was your favorite place in the world.

11:54.141 --> 11:55.649
Let's go together.

11:55.650 --> 11:58.379
Savi, Savi, just... Stop, okay?

11:58.380 --> 12:01.168
It's I-I-it's sweet.

12:01.169 --> 12:03.163
It... it is. I just, um...

12:07.003 --> 12:08.013
What's changed here?

12:08.014 --> 12:10.556
Well, hopefully, you're less mad at me.

12:10.557 --> 12:12.838
N-no, no, no, really.

12:12.839 --> 12:14.300
I don't know.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.342
I was just... thinking that maybe we could

12:17.343 --> 12:20.706
work through our problems
together somewhere,

12:20.707 --> 12:24.129
like on a beach in hotel robes.

12:24.130 --> 12:26.094
I-I-I don't have any problems.

12:26.095 --> 12:27.964
I know what I want.

12:27.965 --> 12:29.224
Yeah, so do I.

12:30.393 --> 12:31.573
I want you.

12:31.574 --> 12:32.867
Do you?

12:32.868 --> 12:34.730
Because you haven't done
anything to make me think so.

12:34.731 --> 12:36.927
Well, that's what I'm trying
to do right now.

12:36.928 --> 12:39.069
But it doesn't work that way, Savi.

12:39.070 --> 12:41.143
Look, I-I asked you to think about

12:41.144 --> 12:44.299
what's going on with you...
Really think...

12:44.300 --> 12:45.899
And I-instead, you-

12:45.900 --> 12:48.078
you want to skip work and hop on a plane.

12:48.079 --> 12:50.178
No, Dom, that's not what I'm saying.

12:50.179 --> 12:51.545
I mean, I-I-it's running away.

12:51.546 --> 12:52.668
You're running away.

12:52.669 --> 12:55.523
You almost died, Savi.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.927
And...

12:56.928 --> 12:58.713
You never even went to therapy.

12:59.643 --> 13:01.566
I-instead, you struck up a friendship

13:01.567 --> 13:03.416
with a-a man who understood you.

13:03.417 --> 13:06.178
- Dom...
- Y-you never even
talked to me about your feelings.

13:06.179 --> 13:09.678
Y-you... we never talked about
the baby... Our baby.

13:09.679 --> 13:12.523
Y-y-you just decided
that you wanted to try again.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.184
I'm sorry.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.862
You can't skip over all this crap,

13:17.863 --> 13:18.775
because if you do,

13:18.776 --> 13:20.587
then things are never gonna
work out for us.

13:20.588 --> 13:22.515
I...

13:22.516 --> 13:24.034
If you're serious about me...

13:25.955 --> 13:28.448
Then I need you to take this seriously.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.154
This is part of our vintage reserve.

13:34.155 --> 13:36.966
These are some of the finest
grapes in Napa, picked in...

13:36.967 --> 13:38.040
I love it.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.115
But my chef was looking
for something a little lighter,

13:40.116 --> 13:41.789
something that pairs nicely with quail?

13:41.790 --> 13:43.966
But... how did you even taste it?

13:43.967 --> 13:44.994
Wait.

13:44.995 --> 13:45.913
Sorry. Hold that thought.

13:47.025 --> 13:48.029
Hey, what's up? I'm working.

13:48.030 --> 13:50.776
Who is Stephanie,
and why is she calling me?

13:51.567 --> 13:52.849
My God. She called you already?

13:52.850 --> 13:55.142
Yeah, she called. She texted.

13:55.143 --> 13:57.308
She requested to follow me on instagram.

13:57.309 --> 13:59.413
Wow. Okay.

13:59.414 --> 14:00.944
Well, I didn't expect that,
but, Harry, she's great.

14:00.945 --> 14:02.921
We went to college together,
and she's really, really smart.

14:02.922 --> 14:04.379
Yeah, so?

14:04.380 --> 14:06.441
So she's cool,
and you should go out with her!

14:06.442 --> 14:07.690
Why?

14:07.691 --> 14:09.015
Because you might like her

14:09.016 --> 14:10.931
and because you haven't been
on a date since Kyra.

14:10.932 --> 14:12.198
It's time to get back out there, buddy.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.542
No, I meant why are you doing this?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.767
Because I'm... I'm worried about you.

14:17.768 --> 14:19.917
I see you putting all of your energy
into the restaurant

14:19.918 --> 14:22.193
and that's awesome but I know how you get.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.946
You're a total workaholic,
and it could be like a year

14:24.947 --> 14:26.833
before you look up
from your griddle or whatever,

14:26.834 --> 14:28.248
and then you'll be pushing 42.

14:28.249 --> 14:29.838
I mean, Harry, you're getting up there.

14:29.839 --> 14:31.378
Right. Hanging up now.

14:31.379 --> 14:33.211
Wait, d-d-did I mention
that she's smoking hot?

14:33.212 --> 14:35.215
Harry?

14:35.216 --> 14:36.616
He's gone.

14:36.617 --> 14:38.719
Okay, quail wine... talk to me.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.022
Hi.

14:56.023 --> 14:57.965
Is there anything in particular
I can help you find?

14:57.966 --> 14:59.595
No, just looking.

15:01.435 --> 15:04.827
Well, my name is April
in case you have any questions.

15:04.828 --> 15:06.720
Great. Thanks, April.

15:21.513 --> 15:23.939
I'm sorry to have burdened you
with all of this.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.200
I'm just at a loss.

15:25.201 --> 15:27.688
I feel so stupid for having missed it.

15:27.689 --> 15:28.760
You're not stupid.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.534
What Anna did, I-it's unfathomable.

15:31.535 --> 15:33.698
So this has never happened
to you before, either?

15:33.699 --> 15:36.879
I've had patients distort the truth,

15:36.880 --> 15:39.138
but, Karen, this is bordering
on sociopathic behavior,

15:39.139 --> 15:40.349
to lie about everything...

15:40.350 --> 15:43.134
Where she lives,
what she does for a living...

15:43.135 --> 15:44.360
To create these fantasies.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.091
I know, but I should've seen it coming.

15:46.092 --> 15:47.469
You want my advice?

15:47.470 --> 15:49.822
Refer her to another doctor.

15:52.171 --> 15:54.090
I-it's no fault of yours,

15:54.091 --> 15:56.450
but she clearly doesn't trust you.

15:56.451 --> 15:58.091
You've spent how many sessions?

15:59.031 --> 15:59.936
Dozens.

15:59.937 --> 16:01.264
And you still don't know
anything real about her.

16:01.265 --> 16:03.609
Which means you're not
any closer to uncovering

16:03.610 --> 16:05.258
what put her in that hospital
in the first place.

16:06.856 --> 16:08.025
That last part may be true,

16:08.026 --> 16:10.486
but I think Anna does trust me.

16:10.487 --> 16:13.027
And we made a breakthrough last night.

16:13.028 --> 16:15.250
She was the most honest she's ever been.

16:15.251 --> 16:17.986
Whatever really happened to her,
she wants to tell me.

16:17.987 --> 16:19.695
She needs to. I can feel it.

16:19.696 --> 16:22.697
The connection between us,
that part is real.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.045
I'm not ready to give up on her.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.862
You? Give up on a patient?

16:30.863 --> 16:33.167
I'd be shocked if you did.

16:38.155 --> 16:39.255
So, what are you gonna do?

16:41.229 --> 16:42.606
I'm gonna try to save her life.

16:49.687 --> 16:50.817
Have a second?

16:50.818 --> 16:52.100
Just one.

16:53.485 --> 16:54.564
I am so sorry,

16:54.565 --> 16:56.660
but I'm gonna have to miss
this afternoon's meeting.

16:56.661 --> 16:57.735
Something came up.

16:57.736 --> 17:00.315
What exactly came up?

17:00.316 --> 17:02.353
Just this appointment
on the West Side of town,

17:02.354 --> 17:03.908
and you know with traffic...

17:03.909 --> 17:06.490
I would try to make it back,
but, you know, it...

17:09.127 --> 17:10.339
No?

17:10.940 --> 17:12.230
No.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.973
This meeting's been scheduled
for four months.

17:13.973 --> 17:15.500
I suggest you move your appointment.

17:17.590 --> 17:20.105
Gallagher, Wilmore & Associates
might be offering me

17:20.106 --> 17:21.522
a position at their law firm,

17:21.523 --> 17:23.523
and they're insisting
on taking me to lunch.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.865
So...

17:26.887 --> 17:28.772
The flowers were f...

17:28.773 --> 17:30.398
From them.

17:31.548 --> 17:33.773
Can you not say anything
to the other partners,

17:33.774 --> 17:35.157
at least until it's real?

17:39.698 --> 17:41.233
And, Toni?

17:43.167 --> 17:44.537
Good luck.

18:55.044 --> 18:56.488
Are you ok?

18:57.513 --> 18:59.271
Thank you so much for coming, Harry.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.904
I I just didn't know who else to call.

19:00.905 --> 19:02.535
Yeah, no worries. Where's Lucy?

19:03.579 --> 19:04.916
Um, at a sleepover.

19:07.095 --> 19:08.904
I'm probably being ridiculous.

19:08.905 --> 19:11.394
There's no reason to think
he followed me home.

19:11.395 --> 19:13.531
Hey. He followed you to your car.

19:13.532 --> 19:14.640
Have you called the police?

19:14.641 --> 19:16.071
I... Didn't.

19:16.985 --> 19:18.303
I think I can't.

19:21.099 --> 19:22.121
W-what do you mean you can't? Why not?

19:24.723 --> 19:26.463
I heard from Paul yesterday.

19:27.132 --> 19:29.705
He just called out of the blue,
and he sounded...

19:29.706 --> 19:32.645
I don't know... panicked,
like he's in real trouble.

19:32.646 --> 19:34.237
I mean, you know, not just

19:34.238 --> 19:35.542
"secretly married to another woman

19:35.543 --> 19:36.814
"and has another kid" kind of trouble.

19:39.286 --> 19:40.754
I really hate that guy.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.672
All right.

19:43.707 --> 19:45.577
Right. What did he say exactly?

19:46.904 --> 19:49.596
Honestly, not much...
Just enough to put me on edge.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.506
Yeah, you know, when Savi told me

19:52.507 --> 19:54.365
about everything with Paul last year,

19:54.366 --> 19:56.648
I... was shocked.

19:56.649 --> 19:58.023
Tell me about it.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.914
No, I mean, I was shocked by you.

19:59.915 --> 20:02.258
Anybody else would have
turned him into the police

20:02.259 --> 20:03.641
just out of spite.

20:03.642 --> 20:05.071
Believe me... I wanted to,

20:05.072 --> 20:07.030
but I just couldn't do that to Lucy.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.796
You know, she still wants to get a cake

20:08.797 --> 20:10.387
for his birthday every year?

20:10.388 --> 20:12.386
So maybe it's time to tell her.

20:12.387 --> 20:14.938
Well, I thought so, too,
but everybody else...

20:14.939 --> 20:16.315
They think I'm crazy!

20:16.316 --> 20:17.807
I don't... I-I just...

20:17.808 --> 20:19.133
I don't know what's right anymore.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.120
You know, when I found out
about Savi and Dominic

20:24.121 --> 20:27.852
Well, it was... devastating, obviously,

20:27.853 --> 20:29.769
but the hardest part for me to grasp

20:29.770 --> 20:32.492
was how long it took for her to tell me.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.506
How long she woke up every morning

20:35.507 --> 20:37.591
and decided to lie.

20:37.592 --> 20:40.662
And to make matters worse you all knew.

20:40.663 --> 20:42.586
- Harry, I am s...
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

20:42.587 --> 20:44.908
I understand you were in a tough position.
It's okay.

20:44.909 --> 20:46.843
No, we were your people, too.

20:48.643 --> 20:50.128
I wish...

20:50.834 --> 20:52.298
I don't know.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.276
You just deserved better.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.938
So does Lucy.

20:59.173 --> 21:00.278
Don't you think?

21:10.213 --> 21:11.993
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:13.229 --> 21:15.144
Dom didn't go for Costa Rica.

21:15.145 --> 21:16.265
Well, yeah.

21:16.266 --> 21:18.750
I mean, shock.

21:18.751 --> 21:20.282
Aw, he didn't?

21:20.283 --> 21:21.653
Ooh.

21:25.288 --> 21:27.527
He wants me to think about things.

21:27.528 --> 21:30.101
I mean, seriously,
what world do we live in

21:30.102 --> 21:31.951
where I say, "Costa Rica," and he says,

21:31.952 --> 21:34.469
"I think you should work on
your deepest, darkest problems"?

21:35.607 --> 21:36.645
The real world?

21:38.065 --> 21:39.638
Fine.

21:39.639 --> 21:40.519
Okay, so...

21:41.818 --> 21:43.965
Why do you think
I messed things up with Dom?

21:43.966 --> 21:45.384
I don't know.

21:45.385 --> 21:46.957
Why do you mess up every relationship?

21:46.958 --> 21:48.425
What are you talking about?

21:48.426 --> 21:49.912
I was with Harry for 15 years.

21:49.913 --> 21:51.302
But it was never that simple.

21:51.303 --> 21:52.351
First, it was long distance...

21:52.352 --> 21:53.605
Yeah, that was only for like a year.

21:53.606 --> 21:55.371
Yeah, because you made him move here,

21:55.372 --> 21:56.946
because you have to be
in control of everything...

21:56.947 --> 21:58.742
Buying the house,
getting him the restaurant.

21:58.743 --> 21:59.797
We were married.

21:59.798 --> 22:02.013
That's what you do for your spouse.

22:02.014 --> 22:03.733
Savi, it's so beyond that.

22:03.734 --> 22:06.319
Listen to me.
You like when people need you.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.017
That's why you were hanging out with Zack.

22:08.018 --> 22:10.392
Hot, sad Zack showed up at the house,

22:10.393 --> 22:11.622
and he needed your help.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.913
Dom, as much as I hate to admit it,

22:13.914 --> 22:15.694
totally has it together.

22:15.695 --> 22:16.786
He doesn't need you.

22:16.787 --> 22:18.232
He just loves you.

22:18.233 --> 22:19.824
My God, why wouldn't I want that?

22:21.075 --> 22:22.550
I know you don't want to hear this,

22:22.551 --> 22:24.078
but I think it's because of your dad.

22:24.424 --> 22:26.747
You clearly have
some unresolved issues there.

22:27.365 --> 22:29.382
Joss, I love you, but that is crap.

22:29.417 --> 22:32.017
I mean, not every bad relationship habit

22:32.018 --> 22:34.098
boils down to daddy issues, okay?

22:34.099 --> 22:35.139
And e-even if it did,

22:35.140 --> 22:37.680
my relationship with my dad
is totally fine.

22:37.681 --> 22:40.155
What relationship? Savi,
the man left when you were 8!

22:40.156 --> 22:42.537
I-I-I-I know, I know.

22:42.538 --> 22:44.395
Mom drove him away. Mom is the devil.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.981
But, honey, he didn't have to drop you

22:45.982 --> 22:47.097
when he dropped her, and he did,

22:47.098 --> 22:48.492
and now every relationship that you're in,

22:48.493 --> 22:50.384
when you find a way,
to make yourself indispensable

22:50.385 --> 22:51.245
because you are terrified

22:51.672 --> 22:53.701
that the guy that you're with is
gonna up and leave you, too.

22:53.702 --> 22:55.244
We do the whole Christmas-card thing,

22:55.245 --> 22:57.162
and he calls me for my birthdays,

22:57.163 --> 23:00.552
and I swear I'm not...
Angry with him at all.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.215
You can't be angry
at somebody you never see.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.587
I've been wondering something.

23:19.588 --> 23:20.989
What?

23:20.990 --> 23:23.024
Why just pick that lie?

23:23.425 --> 23:24.779
The escort story.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.621
I don't know.

23:26.622 --> 23:29.576
One night, I got sucked into watching

23:29.577 --> 23:31.694
the Heidi Fleiss biopic on TV.

23:31.695 --> 23:33.180
Have you seen it?

23:33.181 --> 23:34.592
No.

23:34.593 --> 23:35.700
You're missing out...

23:35.701 --> 23:38.675
Some prime made-for-TV-movie acting.

23:41.475 --> 23:42.485
Anyway...

23:42.486 --> 23:44.505
I'd just gotten off the phone with my mom.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.177
And it was the only thing on at 3:00 a.m.

23:47.178 --> 23:48.887
Why were you talking to your mom
at that hour?

23:50.076 --> 23:51.279
No reason.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.393
How would you describe
your relationship with your mom?

23:55.787 --> 23:57.745
It's fine.

23:57.746 --> 23:58.766
Can we talk about something else?

23:58.767 --> 24:01.108
Anna, I'm happy to talk about
anything you want

24:01.109 --> 24:03.282
as long as it's not another lie.

24:14.665 --> 24:16.603
<i>You will arrive at your destination</i>

24:16.604 --> 24:19.294
<i>in 3 hours and 13 minutes.</i>

24:21.700 --> 24:23.800
Come on, mom. All my friends are going.

24:23.801 --> 24:25.686
Tahoe isn't that far away!

24:25.687 --> 24:26.758
I'm sorry, sweetie.

24:26.759 --> 24:28.601
We just can't afford
a trip like that right now.

24:30.687 --> 24:31.839
Don't answer that!

24:31.840 --> 24:33.840
Calm down. It's just Joss.

24:33.841 --> 24:35.139
See?

24:37.030 --> 24:38.543
Sorry, sweetie.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.209
I'm just a little jumpy lately.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.914
Did you think it was Daniel again?

24:43.574 --> 24:45.938
The other day when you said
it was the wrong number,

24:45.939 --> 24:47.704
it was so obviously Daniel.

24:57.538 --> 24:58.958
Lucy... it's okay. I get it.

24:58.959 --> 25:01.099
You think it'd be weird or whatever for me

25:01.100 --> 25:02.339
if you got back together with him.

25:03.115 --> 25:04.131
But it's fine.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.028
Relationships between
men and women, they can be...

25:10.029 --> 25:13.203
Confusing, and life is
sometimes complicated.

25:13.404 --> 25:14.732
Mom, I know.

25:14.733 --> 25:15.855
I just wanted you to know

25:15.856 --> 25:17.431
that I wouldn't freak out or anything

25:17.432 --> 25:18.767
if you guys started dating again.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.054
I can handle it.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.467
Your...

25:26.468 --> 25:28.004
Can I have more apple juice, please?

25:40.371 --> 25:42.037
10 people, babe.

25:42.038 --> 25:43.423
You have to have 10 friends

25:43.424 --> 25:44.998
that you want to invite
to the soft opening,

25:44.999 --> 25:46.750
preferably 10 rich friends

25:46.751 --> 25:48.862
who are gonna eat at wunderbar
every single weekend.

25:49.856 --> 25:51.507
No, grandma June does not count!

25:51.508 --> 25:53.371
Come on. You're part owner, Scott.

25:53.372 --> 25:54.647
A little excitement here.

25:54.648 --> 25:56.020
Hold, please.

25:57.336 --> 25:58.332
Hey.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.884
I'm not even sure if the words "thank you"
can suffice for that date!

26:00.885 --> 26:03.855
- Wow. You guys went out already?
- Just now!

26:03.856 --> 26:05.879
He was a total gentlemen,
paid for everything,

26:05.880 --> 26:07.576
and those eyes, I mean are they real?

26:07.577 --> 26:09.671
For a second, I thought
that they were color contacts.

26:09.672 --> 26:11.745
Yeah, those are real.

26:11.746 --> 26:13.428
He's totally amazing, Joss,

26:13.429 --> 26:15.375
and there was definitely
a connection between us.

26:15.376 --> 26:16.655
I think he's gonna call me again.

26:16.656 --> 26:18.696
I'm... so happy to hear that.

26:18.697 --> 26:20.207
Okay, I got to go,

26:20.208 --> 26:22.519
but let's get together soon,
and thanks again.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.293
Bye.

26:27.247 --> 26:28.540
Shoot!

26:28.541 --> 26:29.853
Um, w-w... Scott?

26:29.854 --> 26:31.319
Are you still there? I'm so sorry.

27:07.402 --> 27:08.870
Any news?

27:08.871 --> 27:09.989
I got it.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.624
Yeah, I thought you would.

27:11.625 --> 27:13.862
Congratulations, Toni.

27:13.863 --> 27:15.130
It's a smart move for you.

27:15.131 --> 27:16.112
I think you're gonna do well over there.

27:16.113 --> 27:17.735
Thanks. I think I so, too.

27:19.121 --> 27:20.539
And she's humble.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.517
So, you, you tell anybody else yet?

27:22.518 --> 27:24.443
I'm gonna tell the partners on Monday,

27:24.444 --> 27:25.693
and I was gonna give two weeks.

27:25.694 --> 27:27.103
Does that sound right?

27:27.104 --> 27:28.555
- Does to me.
- Perfecto.

27:28.556 --> 27:29.666
Hey.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.120
I think you owe me a celebratory drink.

27:33.271 --> 27:34.326
Um...

27:34.327 --> 27:35.980
Yeah, I-I don't think so, Toni.

27:35.981 --> 27:37.344
I-I-I got a lot of work to do.

27:37.345 --> 27:38.375
Come on!

27:38.376 --> 27:40.201
Just think of it as, like,
my exit interview.

27:42.656 --> 27:44.051
Just one drink.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.558
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

28:08.327 --> 28:09.601
- Savannah?
- Hi, dad.

28:09.602 --> 28:12.110
Well, I thought that you were...

28:12.111 --> 28:13.324
Is everything okay?

28:13.325 --> 28:15.441
Yeah, yeah, I t... yeah, everything's fine.

28:15.442 --> 28:16.360
I was just in town,

28:16.361 --> 28:18.160
so I-I thought I'd come say hi to you,

28:18.161 --> 28:19.695
but you're clearly
on your way out, so I...

28:19.696 --> 28:21.795
No, no, no, no, I was just gonna
go get some groceries.

28:21.796 --> 28:22.546
You want to come in?

28:22.547 --> 28:23.959
Sure.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.137
Come on.

28:28.598 --> 28:30.707
Geez, I'm sorry the place is such a mess.

28:30.708 --> 28:34.067
Sally, she went off
to Arizona for her book club,

28:34.068 --> 28:35.888
and I wasn't expecting company.

28:35.889 --> 28:37.862
It's okay. You don't have to clean for me.

28:37.863 --> 28:40.513
Okay, well, would you like
something to drink?

28:40.514 --> 28:42.018
Would you like some water, some coffee?

28:42.019 --> 28:43.007
I have beer.

28:43.008 --> 28:45.147
We're fine, right?

28:45.589 --> 28:46.977
I mean, I-I know...

28:46.978 --> 28:49.032
That we don't see each other enough

28:49.033 --> 28:51.837
and that I'm really bad with phone calls,

28:51.838 --> 28:53.713
but, I mean, o-our...

28:54.819 --> 28:57.563
Relationship I-is fine, don't you think?

28:57.564 --> 28:58.603
Yeah.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.028
I... Sure.

29:01.029 --> 29:02.990
I mean, I think so, yeah.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.490
Yeah, yeah, so do I.

29:04.491 --> 29:07.080
You were always so mature, Savi.

29:07.081 --> 29:09.538
I mean, you understood things
at a young age.

29:10.617 --> 29:13.493
I was real grateful for that
'cause, you know,

29:13.494 --> 29:15.690
your mother didn't exactly
make things easy.

29:15.691 --> 29:18.426
Yeah, well, she's
not exactly an easy person.

29:18.427 --> 29:21.298
No, she's not, but...

29:21.299 --> 29:22.355
I don't have to tell you that.

29:22.356 --> 29:23.534
Yeah.

29:23.535 --> 29:25.516
Of course.

29:27.541 --> 29:29.502
Wow. This is beautiful.

29:31.176 --> 29:33.030
Who is this girl?

29:33.031 --> 29:34.042
That's Kaley.

29:34.043 --> 29:36.155
Kaley is, Sally's eldest,

29:36.156 --> 29:39.071
and she got married
about a year ago in Kauai.

29:39.072 --> 29:39.831
You ever been?

29:40.399 --> 29:42.339
I thought you didn't do planes.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.615
Well, it took a few more Bloody Marys

29:44.616 --> 29:46.297
than I'd like to admit.

29:47.625 --> 29:49.709
You know, a special occasion...

29:49.710 --> 29:51.435
Didn't want to miss my daughter's wedding.

29:54.951 --> 29:56.585
You didn't make my wedding.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.350
So, how is Harry?

30:01.351 --> 30:03.853
We are still separated.

30:03.854 --> 30:05.594
Actually, we're divorced.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.061
You know, I-I think I should go.

30:07.062 --> 30:08.349
You're angry.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.468
I'm not angry.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.102
You know what? Maybe... maybe I am angry.

30:13.137 --> 30:13.982
Maybe I'm furious.

30:15.469 --> 30:17.529
But it doesn't really matter, does it?

30:25.111 --> 30:26.827
- Sorpresa.
- No.

30:28.668 --> 30:30.105
Come on, we're celebrating.

30:30.106 --> 30:31.305
Yeah, well, I've celebrated my way

30:31.306 --> 30:32.660
through two old fashioneds already.

30:32.661 --> 30:35.959
Listen, I have given at least three guys

30:35.960 --> 30:37.433
my best smoldering eye,

30:37.434 --> 30:38.845
and I still don't have a number.

30:38.846 --> 30:41.706
So, no, I am not losing my wingman.

30:41.707 --> 30:42.678
I see.

30:42.679 --> 30:44.315
So this is a... there's
a mission happening here?

30:45.443 --> 30:48.346
Please, like you're not gonna
drunk-dial Savi later?

30:52.623 --> 30:55.013
I can't believe she let you go so easily.

30:55.014 --> 30:57.693
No, no, we're just...
We're just on a break.

30:57.694 --> 31:00.648
Yeah, things will get back on track soon.
I... I think...

31:00.649 --> 31:02.671
Really? What track is that?

31:04.357 --> 31:05.863
You know, move in, get married...

31:05.864 --> 31:07.402
All very boring to you.

31:09.281 --> 31:10.889
No, not at all.

31:10.890 --> 31:12.305
I want all those things.

31:12.306 --> 31:15.305
I want the fence and the baby.

31:15.353 --> 31:17.142
One day.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.080
But I got to say,

31:18.081 --> 31:20.410
it is very bold of you
to move into her house.

31:20.411 --> 31:23.527
That, my friend, I cannot do.

31:23.528 --> 31:24.767
Yeah, well, t-t-that's not happening.

31:24.768 --> 31:27.121
Yeah, that's the main reason why
she's selling the house, anyway.

31:28.121 --> 31:30.600
But she's not selling.
She bought Harry out.

31:33.948 --> 31:35.482
W-what are you...
What are you talking about?

31:35.483 --> 31:37.002
She was on the phone,

31:37.003 --> 31:40.275
talking with him about it forever.

31:40.276 --> 31:42.070
Savi's staying in that house.

31:43.801 --> 31:44.943
Did you really not know?

31:47.679 --> 31:49.117
You know what? Um...

31:49.118 --> 31:51.466
I'm gonna leave, but, hey, you know,

31:51.467 --> 31:52.435
good luck at the new firm.

31:52.436 --> 31:53.912
Dom, wait. I'm sorry.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.784
It was stupid of me to say anything.

31:55.785 --> 31:56.865
I shouldn't have s...

31:56.866 --> 31:58.532
No, Toni, Toni, this is not on you, okay?

31:58.533 --> 32:00.304
It's not on you. I just... I need go.

32:01.355 --> 32:02.746
No, you don't!

32:04.289 --> 32:06.258
You're angry. Good. You should be.

32:06.259 --> 32:08.877
You're finally realizing
what I knew all along.

32:08.878 --> 32:11.055
Savi doesn't deserve you.

32:12.291 --> 32:13.338
She never did.

32:47.827 --> 32:49.804
<i>It's Dom. Go ahead and leave that message.</i>

32:49.805 --> 32:52.453
Hi, Dom, it's... it's me.

32:52.454 --> 32:55.271
And I've been doing
what you asked me to do.

32:55.272 --> 32:57.678
I think I understand some things now,

32:57.679 --> 32:59.671
so m-maybe you can call me back, okay?

33:00.510 --> 33:01.103
I love you.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.378
Bye.

33:10.408 --> 33:11.842
<i>Hey, you've reached Zack.</i>

33:11.843 --> 33:12.617
<i>Leave your message,</i>

33:12.618 --> 33:13.772
<i>and I'll call you back when I can.</i>

33:13.773 --> 33:15.660
Hi, Zack.

33:15.661 --> 33:16.876
It's Savi.

33:18.152 --> 33:22.223
And I, just wanted
to call a-and apologize to you.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.863
You were right about a lot of things

33:25.864 --> 33:28.696
that I didn't realize
at the time, but... but I...

33:29.521 --> 33:32.693
Understand now, so I-I just...
I'm sorry, and...

33:34.088 --> 33:35.196
I hope that you'll forgive me.

33:36.535 --> 33:37.847
Okay.

33:37.848 --> 33:39.578
Bye.

33:45.603 --> 33:47.683
- Oy!
- I'm in here!

33:50.718 --> 33:52.147
I know, I know.

33:52.148 --> 33:53.648
I don't need five menu mock-ups,

33:53.649 --> 33:55.421
but I literally love every single font.

33:55.422 --> 33:57.521
And I rearranged the seating chart, so...

33:58.461 --> 34:00.208
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

34:00.209 --> 34:03.967
Why would you set me up
on that horrible date?

34:03.968 --> 34:05.347
The woman chews with her mouth open.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.083
Bummer.

34:08.083 --> 34:10.273
Yeah, and... wait for it.

34:10.274 --> 34:13.308
She doesn't eat night shades.

34:13.309 --> 34:15.016
I... Don't know what that means.

34:15.016 --> 34:16.817
Well, the point is there
was nothing about this woman,

34:16.818 --> 34:19.380
other than the fact that she
also happens to be divorced,

34:19.380 --> 34:24.030
that would make us a good fit,
so why did you set us up?

34:24.031 --> 34:26.518
I-I-I told you. I was worried about you.

34:26.619 --> 34:29.862
That is crap, and we both know it!

34:30.463 --> 34:33.203
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Harry.

34:33.204 --> 34:34.938
Come on, Joss, just admit it!

34:34.940 --> 34:36.239
Joss?

34:37.355 --> 34:38.145
Okay.

34:38.146 --> 34:39.958
You feel guilty about Savi.

34:42.877 --> 34:44.154
Yeah, m-maybe I do.

34:45.922 --> 34:48.119
And you're in this
healthy relationship now,

34:48.120 --> 34:50.030
and whenever women are in relationships,

34:50.031 --> 34:52.022
their sole purpose in life
becomes about finding

34:52.023 --> 34:53.364
relationships for other people.

34:53.364 --> 34:56.301
Wow! That is sexist and vaguely insulting.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.596
But you don't have to, Joss.

34:58.565 --> 34:59.328
I'm doing great.

34:59.329 --> 35:00.531
I'm happy, and when I'm ready
to find someone,

35:00.532 --> 35:02.121
I will.

35:02.122 --> 35:04.844
It's that easy for men, isn't it?

35:04.845 --> 35:06.307
Well, I don't know about other men,

35:06.308 --> 35:08.281
but for me, yep, it is that easy.

35:14.841 --> 35:17.153
Scott thinks that we spend
too much time together.

35:18.471 --> 35:19.624
So, I don't know.

35:19.625 --> 35:21.675
I thought that maybe if you were
seeing someone else...

35:21.676 --> 35:22.919
Anyway, it was stupid.

35:23.505 --> 35:24.736
Well, wait.

35:25.637 --> 35:28.589
Do... do you think we spend
too much time together?

35:28.590 --> 35:29.623
We work together!

35:29.624 --> 35:30.932
Come on. And if it wasn't work...

35:30.933 --> 35:32.546
But it is. All right, it's work.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.242
Right, right, so whatever!
Anyway, men are idiots, including you.

35:35.243 --> 35:37.695
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go call Stephanie

35:37.696 --> 35:39.472
and tell her that you have herpes.

35:49.205 --> 35:52.184
The guy at the store
said it welcomes good energy and peace

35:52.185 --> 35:55.082
but also possibly bees, F.Y.I.

35:56.582 --> 35:57.578
It's beautiful.

35:57.579 --> 35:58.658
Thank you.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.059
I wanted something to say goodbye.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.966
I've decided to look for another doctor.

36:03.967 --> 36:05.633
I don't think this is really working.

36:07.157 --> 36:08.502
I understand.

36:08.503 --> 36:10.183
But since you're already here today,

36:10.184 --> 36:11.853
why don't we take advantage of this hour?

36:11.854 --> 36:13.808
I guess,

36:13.809 --> 36:16.119
but only if it's not as boring
as our last session.

36:18.145 --> 36:19.469
See, and I thought our last session

36:19.470 --> 36:20.825
was very interesting.

36:20.826 --> 36:22.612
I learned a lot about you.

36:22.613 --> 36:24.313
Yeah? Like what?

36:25.386 --> 36:27.337
The fact that your parents
don't live here.

36:29.325 --> 36:31.777
You were speaking to your mom
at 3:00 a.m.,

36:31.778 --> 36:33.988
which was 7:00 p.m. in Korea time.

36:35.484 --> 36:36.895
My father lives in Korea.

36:36.896 --> 36:39.199
Sometimes I forget the 17-hour difference

36:39.200 --> 36:40.596
before calling.

36:42.866 --> 36:43.677
When did you move here?

36:45.021 --> 36:46.045
A while ago.

36:46.046 --> 36:47.190
How old were you?

36:48.412 --> 36:49.485
17.

36:49.486 --> 36:51.153
That's young to move to a new country

36:51.154 --> 36:52.554
all by yourself.

36:54.856 --> 36:56.333
I wasn't by myself.

36:56.890 --> 36:58.444
I came with my husband.

37:00.826 --> 37:02.113
How did you meet your husband?

37:02.114 --> 37:03.486
Elliot.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.514
He was my English teacher back home.

37:08.515 --> 37:10.719
An American from California.

37:13.633 --> 37:16.505
I remember the first time
that I saw him, I...

37:17.901 --> 37:20.440
Thought he was the most handsome
man I'd ever seen.

37:21.537 --> 37:23.441
And he liked me, too. I could tell.

37:25.665 --> 37:28.482
So one night, I stayed late after class,

37:28.483 --> 37:30.182
and...

37:31.456 --> 37:33.315
He kissed me.

37:33.316 --> 37:34.685
You fell in love.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.677
But he was only ever supposed
to stay in Korea

37:39.678 --> 37:40.993
for a few months.

37:42.170 --> 37:45.005
And when it was time for him
to go back to the States,

37:45.006 --> 37:47.141
he asked me to marry him.

37:47.742 --> 37:50.258
And I said yes.

37:51.092 --> 37:52.654
And your parents?

37:53.673 --> 37:55.653
My mom was destroyed.

37:56.965 --> 37:59.792
My dad threatened to sue the school.

38:01.095 --> 38:03.074
I was only 16 when we met.

38:03.514 --> 38:06.488
So I left without telling them.

38:06.489 --> 38:09.830
In the middle of the night,
I just... left.

38:10.523 --> 38:12.487
And you got married in America?

38:15.406 --> 38:16.987
But then...

38:18.117 --> 38:19.713
Our wedding night...

38:21.763 --> 38:23.814
I didn't realize what it meant until...

38:24.369 --> 38:25.771
I was in it.

38:25.872 --> 38:28.152
I hadn't even been on a date
before Elliot.

38:28.153 --> 38:29.861
My dad was strict about stuff like that.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.646
Anyway, I... I wasn't ready.

38:36.013 --> 38:39.371
I needed more time to get to know him.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.612
But he said, "it's our wedding night."

38:44.613 --> 38:45.963
"We have to."

38:48.133 --> 38:51.045
So he just...

38:51.046 --> 38:52.652
Did.

38:52.653 --> 38:54.405
He raped you.

38:56.296 --> 38:57.763
I still tried.

38:58.186 --> 39:00.181
Even after that,
I tried to be a good wife,

39:00.182 --> 39:02.334
even though I could tell
that he didn't love me.

39:02.335 --> 39:04.969
I'd already ruined it.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.773
And then one day, he was gone.

39:08.879 --> 39:10.362
What did you do?

39:10.363 --> 39:13.041
I couldn't tell my family.

39:14.803 --> 39:16.137
So I thought...

39:17.049 --> 39:20.162
If I could stay, find a new husband,

39:20.163 --> 39:21.789
maybe it would be okay.

39:22.462 --> 39:24.330
I started dating, and...

39:26.529 --> 39:29.495
I actually met someone
that I think I loved.

39:31.334 --> 39:32.702
Sean.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.009
He was...

39:34.833 --> 39:36.387
Smart and...

39:37.384 --> 39:38.880
Funny, and...

39:42.218 --> 39:44.055
He paid attention to me.

39:48.008 --> 39:50.439
But then he left, too.

39:51.313 --> 39:52.599
And that's when I understood.

39:54.878 --> 39:55.968
Understood?

39:55.969 --> 39:57.949
That it's me.

39:57.950 --> 40:00.594
Not them. There's something wrong with me.

40:01.673 --> 40:04.063
Anna, it's not you.

40:04.064 --> 40:06.245
It is. It's me.

40:06.280 --> 40:10.390
And I didn't want
to feel like this anymore.

40:12.181 --> 40:14.328
I didn't want to feel anything.

40:19.409 --> 40:23.003
You're okay.

40:24.575 --> 40:26.660
You're okay.

40:39.908 --> 40:41.356
It's me.

40:42.579 --> 40:44.771
I'm... I'm not turning myself
in, so don't worry about it.

40:44.772 --> 40:46.235
Don't worry about it?

40:46.236 --> 40:48.850
- That's all I've been doing since you called me!
- I know.

40:48.851 --> 40:50.843
I-I can't keep this from Lucy
anymore. I have to tell her.

40:53.753 --> 40:56.329
You and Lucy are both safer
if you think I'm dead.

40:56.330 --> 40:57.947
Am I not safe now?

40:57.948 --> 41:00.362
Paul, what did you do?! Who is after you?!

41:00.363 --> 41:01.845
I'm sorry, April.

41:04.334 --> 41:05.498
I can't forget it!

41:05.499 --> 41:08.810
What if I need you? How can I contact you?

41:08.811 --> 41:10.241
You can't just disappear on me again!

41:10.242 --> 41:11.949
I'll come up with something...

41:11.950 --> 41:13.866
A way to get in touch if you need me.

41:13.867 --> 41:15.195
I'll figure it out.

41:15.196 --> 41:17.570
How? How are you gonna figure it out?

41:24.648 --> 41:28.131
Mom!

41:28.132 --> 41:29.174
You have five more seconds,

41:29.175 --> 41:30.898
or I'm starting the movie without you!
