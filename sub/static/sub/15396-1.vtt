02:09.838 --> 02:12.341
Mum? Mum?

02:14.051 --> 02:15.473
Mum?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.225
Mum?

02:19.723 --> 02:21.145
Mum?

02:23.894 --> 02:25.362
Mum?

02:26.355 --> 02:27.982
Mum? Mum?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.740
Mum?

02:36.698 --> 02:38.200
You all right?

02:41.036 --> 02:43.380
I was just thinking about Poppy.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.672
She was me only friend.

02:47.751 --> 02:51.426
Aw, Mum. I'm your friend.

02:53.924 --> 02:57.599
You're not a friend.
You're just a relative.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.106
I'm 34 years old!

03:01.181 --> 03:04.731
And I've found someone who likes me,
and I like him,

03:04.768 --> 03:06.611
and I'm going on holiday with him.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.940
You're running away

03:09.856 --> 03:13.076
from your... guilt!

03:14.861 --> 03:17.114
Don't do that with Poppy's lead, Mum.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.638
<i>You've always had lovely hair, Tina.</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:35.136
<i>It is quite thick, isn't it?</i>

03:35.215 --> 03:36.637
<i>Yes.</i>

03:36.717 --> 03:41.473
<i>I've always admired your hair
being thick, because mine's so thin.</i>

03:42.973 --> 03:48.651
<i>I think you might have a few split ends.
Better watch that.</i>

03:51.148 --> 03:53.822
- Any more bags you want taking?
- Well,

03:53.942 --> 03:56.821
- I might want a couple more towels.
- No, not in there.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.615
You didn't tell me
your mum was an artist.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.829
What?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.664
Look at these.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.462
Chris, don't go in there.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.589
Why not?
- Come out. Chris.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.337
What's going on?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.919
I'm just admiring
your artwork, Carol. It's fantastic.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.130
I don't want anyone in my room.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.930
Chris was just saying how talented
he thinks you are, Mum.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.226
It's my private sanctum.
I don't want anybody looking.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.850
Well, no one's looking
in your sanctum, Mum.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.057
So I'll just... Shall I leave you, then,
to look at your brushes?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.734
I'll just sit for a few minutes, yes.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.187
- Okay.
- I could do with a cup of tea.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.443
- I'll get you one, Mum.
- That'd be nice.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.196
- I'm shutting the door now.
- That's okay.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.697
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.779
Okay, Mum, bye.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.284
Bye.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.574
- All right?
- Yeah.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.079
Good.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.298
- I've always wanted a boy in my bed.
- Come on.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.000
- Have you?
- Yeah. I was never allowed.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.677
I've always wanted to be in this bed.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.972
- This is Jonty.
- Oh, he's putting me off.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.100
- I like this room.
- Do you?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.935
- Mmm.
- I hate it.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.358
Why?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.653
Well, I like the bits.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.363
Makes me think of you
when you were a kid.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.072
At the same time, if it was
all destroyed, I'd be quite happy.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.122
So what were you like
when you were a little kid, then?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.872
- Unhappy.
- You didn't like school?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.828
- I know, nor me.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.789
What were you like at school, Chris?

05:30.872 --> 05:33.716
I wasn't like anything.
I was, like, invisible.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.419
<i>What about you being ginger?</i>

05:35.502 --> 05:37.596
<i>Weli, that's a problem, yeah.</i>

05:37.671 --> 05:39.469
<i>That's not invisible, is it?</i>

05:39.548 --> 05:41.846
<i>No, but I wanted to be.</i>

05:43.093 --> 05:45.892
Oh, I don't think it's safe
going off with him.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.814
It is safe!

05:47.889 --> 05:52.770
I know about all kinds of people who've
had very bad experiences in caravans.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.275
Like who?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.652
Well, Louise.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.825
<i>She fell out of it, didn't she?</i>

05:58.900 --> 06:02.530
<i>Oh, I don't know. I mean, you've gone
far too fast with him far too soon.</i>

06:02.612 --> 06:04.330
<i>You hardly know him.</i>

06:06.199 --> 06:09.499
<i>You look like you...
you don't trust him.</i>

06:09.578 --> 06:11.080
<i>I don't.</i>

06:11.162 --> 06:12.709
<i>Just let him get on with it.</i>

06:13.373 --> 06:15.375
Well, I'd like to know
what he's getting on with.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.507
- Well, he's packing.
- How much of our stuff has he got?

06:19.921 --> 06:23.676
Mum, he hasn't got any of your stuff.
Don't be silly.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.936
<i>- All right, uh, toothbrush?
- Yeah.</i>

06:30.015 --> 06:31.562
<i>- And a sponge?
- Yeah.</i>

06:32.017 --> 06:33.735
- Umbrella?
- Yes.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.402
- Uh, wash bag?
- Yes.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.862
- What's that? What's that?
- Potpourri.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.160
And what are you bringing that for?
We don't need potpourri.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.660
I don't think I could cope
without potpourri, Chris.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.117
You're gonna have a woman's touch
on this holiday, Chris.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.746
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.328
Oh, Chris.
Don't look at my bum.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.505
<i>- I'm not looking at your bum.
- You are.</i>

06:53.580 --> 06:55.503
<i>- Just son' of loomed into my vision.</i>

06:58.084 --> 06:59.506
Milady.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.935
- Bye, Mum.
- You'll be back.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.933
I will, Mum, in a week.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.308
Okay, well, we'll see you then, Carol.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.189
I'll bring her back safe,
don't you worry.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.317
Hey, I understand
you collect snow globes.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.899
I don't like you.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.778
Okay, well, see you, then.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.161
Show me your world, Chris.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.334
Well, I thought we'd start
with Crich Tram Museum.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.878
- Great.
- Murderer.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.082
It was an accident, Mum.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.586
So were you.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.501
Don't listen to her.

08:15.036 --> 08:19.462
<i>Ii For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:51.581
That's, uh, 32.99.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.246
- Extra strong.
- How can you?

08:57.328 --> 08:58.955
Ah, sharpens the mind.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.507
Poppy loved mints.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.345
- They gave her the runs.
- Mint me.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.163
- Hold tight, please.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.049
So, ladies and gentlemen,
this is, um,

09:43.124 --> 09:46.799
one of about 1,200 tram cars
of this type, of type E1,

09:46.878 --> 09:50.633
built, um, by London County Council

09:50.715 --> 09:53.594
from about 1912 onwards.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.931
Out of those 1,200 trams,
only two have survived.

09:58.765 --> 10:03.020
You know, mobility,
the key to personal opportunity.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.528
It's why I favour the Abbey Oxford
as a caravan.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.904
So I'm the captain of me own fate.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.536
Excuse me, you dropped your wrapper.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.205
Your wrapper.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.380
I said, you dropped your wrapper.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.051
You see that? Do you see that?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.416
You just
don't expect to see that, do you?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.415
No. He was a pig, Chris.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.124
He was a pig in clothes.
I don't want this to ruin our holiday.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.750
You expect that of a kid
who doesn't know any better.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.255
- But that's a bloody grown man.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.974
He must be, what, 35,
something like that?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.606
- Yeah, you don't expect it.
- Behaving like that in front of...

11:12.672 --> 11:14.345
- He's setting an example to kids...
- I know, it's terrible.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.768
And we're in a place where there's...
It's a bloody heritage place.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.265
- I know. Shh. I know.
- I just cannot...

11:18.344 --> 11:19.766
Maybe you'll feel better
if you have a scone.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.181
- No. No.
- Do you want a scone?

11:21.264 --> 11:24.108
No! They've not been preserved
for hundreds of years

11:24.142 --> 11:25.940
- so that wankers like that...
- Shh. Shh.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.103
...can use them like a bloody toilet!

11:27.145 --> 11:28.943
<i>Tina Read
to the Visitor Information Centre.</i>

11:28.980 --> 11:31.449
Stop telling me to shush.
It's putting me on edge.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.368
<i>Miss Tina Read,
your mother's on the phone.</i>

11:36.279 --> 11:37.952
I'm gonna have to go
and see what's wrong.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.453
Yeah.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.330
Wait here, won't you?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.196
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy
the museum if you're in this state.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.031
I'll have to come home, then.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.411
Chris is up there, he's looking at me.
I don't...

12:16.861 --> 12:18.989
Well, no! I'm gonna have...

12:19.072 --> 12:22.193
Well, I'm gonna have to come back, Mum,
'cause I can't leave you in this state.

12:31.334 --> 12:35.009
- Hey, what's up? Oh, come on, what's up?

12:35.088 --> 12:38.092
Hey. What's happened?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.223
- What'd she say?
We have to go home.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.767
Why? What, because of her?

12:44.681 --> 12:47.400
Blue John mines tomorrow. Pencil Museum.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.190
I know how much you wanted to see that.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.903
Got some vouchers as well.
Two-for-one restaurant deal.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.786
They expire in a week.
It's now or never.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.269
He just stepped out, Chris,
and it wasn't your fault.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.280
Maybe you're right.

14:16.397 --> 14:20.948
I just feel so
devastated for his family, you know?

14:22.653 --> 14:25.623
- Maybe your mother was right.
- About what?

14:25.740 --> 14:27.333
About everything!

14:27.617 --> 14:29.085
About everything.

14:29.243 --> 14:33.749
- Chris...
- He's ruined the Tram Museum for me now.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.144
Mint me.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.772
What?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.480
You heard me. Mint me.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.477
<i>"Dear Mum, I'm not coming home."</i>

15:35.518 --> 15:38.397
<i>"Yorkshire is lovely.
Not like you said at all."</i>

15:38.521 --> 15:42.151
<i>"They can smile,
and they do sell my pasta sauce."</i>

15:42.525 --> 15:45.870
<i>"The caravan bed is quite short,
but Chris is a sensitive lover."</i>

15:45.903 --> 15:49.328
<i>"Hope you can be happy for me.
Love, Tina."</i>

16:02.753 --> 16:04.847
Right, well,
they've only got two spots left.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.385
One by the Dingley Dell
and one by the bogs.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.554
Um, he's going for Dingley Dell.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.352
Chris, I want Dingley Dell.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.016
I'm gonna get this bloody Dingley Dell.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.944
- Can't we go around it?
- Just hold on, I'm gonna do it.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.820
- Go around them. Go around.
- We'll make it.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.856
- Go that way.
- I will, just wait there, wait...

16:21.898 --> 16:24.026
- Just go around it.
- Okay! Hold on.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.569
Oh, Chris! Don't look at them, Chris.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.700
Oh, I just...

16:34.160 --> 16:35.582
Fuck you!

16:36.245 --> 16:39.499
I am the best. Get in.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.340
- Now, see that?
- Yes.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.593
Plug that into that
little hole over there. Right?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.425
Why?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.724
You don't need to know why. Just do it.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.931
- Okay?
- The little hole.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.769
The little hole.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.574
Turn it round so that fits
in that little bit there.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.195
- That hole...
- No, I wanna do it.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.279
- Okay.
- This is a ridiculous plug, this.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.281
Never seen anything like it.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.122
There we go.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.704
- I did it.
- Brilliant.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.422
I'll just sort that out.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.762
Chris?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.633
What?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.555
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.553
Yeah, I suppose it is, yeah.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.439
I didn't think it would kill him,
did you, Chris?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.912
Well, there's loads of stuff
under a caravan that'll kill you.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.894
I'll have nightmares
about that tonight now.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.982
Oh, you're not gonna go under a caravan,
are you?

17:45.106 --> 17:47.655
You're gonna be in the driving seat.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.736
In the car, with me.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.782
Well, not driving.
I mean, in the passenger seat.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.746
I'll do the driving.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.087
Bit of a mess, actually.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.007
There we go, good as new.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.261
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.769
There's no one sticking their nose in.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.346
No one penetrating the mind.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.142
I'll have to sort
all of this out all again.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.312
Take the noble English oak,
Old Knobbley.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.940
That won't stab you in the back
or belittle your five-year plan.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.867
I mean, where am I supposed to put that?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.531
- That tree won't...
- There isn't anywhere.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.495
- There's just no surfaces.
- ...steal things that belong to you

18:33.529 --> 18:36.203
and put them in another place
just to piss you off.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.661
That tree won't involve itself
in low-level bullying

18:40.870 --> 18:43.293
that means you have to leave work.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.717
I've got a confession to make.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.337
Chris. Not a wheat intolerance?

18:49.378 --> 18:53.679
No. It's, uh, it's not just
an erotic odyssey we're on.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.685
Isn't it?

18:56.719 --> 18:59.222
Well, it is.
I mean, that's a big part of it, but...

18:59.388 --> 19:01.390
Er, I'm writing a book.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.983
- Are you?
- Yeah.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.357
I thought I'd just have
a bit of a sabbatical.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.069
You know, a bit of time off work
and, you know, find my voice.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.492
But, uh, I've had a bit of a problem
with writer's block.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.366
You know, been...
creative constipation.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.076
I hooked up with you at capoeira

19:16.197 --> 19:19.076
and I realised you were exactly
what I needed. You know, a muse.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.043
- Am I your muse?
- Yeah.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.247
- Chris!
- How do you feel about that?

19:24.372 --> 19:25.919
I've never been a muse before.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.637
No? I've never had a muse before.
It's great. Yeah.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.679
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.928
- What's the book about?

19:35.007 --> 19:40.514
Just sort of making inroads into
my own mind and taking notes as I go.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.223
Do you know what I mean? It's fantastic.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.150
I'm really pleased with
what I've come up with so far.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.445
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hello.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.942
Settled in?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.524
Yeah, we have, thanks.
Yeah, lovely spot.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.029
- Not bad, is it?
- Yeah.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.283
Just doing my rounds.
Sorry about the racket.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.205
- Yeah.
- Festival in the yurt field.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.204
- Who are they?
- Uh, well, they're shaman.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.753
They're sort of priests. Shamans.
They're from Portsmouth, you know.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.706
- Uh-huh.
- It's just a little festival.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.382
Keeps them all happy, doesn't it?
You know.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.177
And how long are they
gonna be drumming for?

20:10.251 --> 20:12.219
Well, just this evening.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.047
- Okay?
- Thanks a lot, mate.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.348
- All the best.
- Yeah.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.142
- Bye.
- Pleasure.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.142
He seemed nice.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.020
Yurts.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.683
There's a stream
down here somewhere.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.497
I need some proper boots, Chris.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.332
Yeah,
brought my last girlfriend.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.837
Oh.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.056
Yeah, I think this was it.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.218
This is a ditch, Chris.

21:10.227 --> 21:13.231
I thought he said on the phone
we'd be at the Dingley Dell.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.658
- I know, darling.
- We're right by the loo.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.407
- Well, that'll be handy.
- Shall I take some light stuff, darling?

21:18.486 --> 21:21.365
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Sterling Elite 90, isn't it?

21:21.447 --> 21:22.869
Sorry?

21:23.824 --> 21:25.622
Sterling Elite 90.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.166
Yeah. Yes.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.626
How'd you find it
on the petrol consumption?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.215
Uh, not too bad, actually.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.968
Takes her less fuel to pull
than some of the older models.

21:38.047 --> 21:42.302
Yeah, you're probably right, yeah.
We use loads of petrol. Don't we, Tina?

21:42.384 --> 21:44.307
Yeah, we love it.

21:44.386 --> 21:49.267
Hey, do you mind if we have
a little look inside? Is that all right?

21:49.350 --> 21:50.772
Um...

21:50.851 --> 21:53.070
- I'll only be a second.
- A quick look wouldn't hurt.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.147
- Yeah.
- Okay. Fine.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.529
We really appreciate it.
Be fantastic to have a look in there.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.485
Sorry, do you mind
just slipping those off?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.888
- I saw you come out of the toilet block.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:03.906 --> 22:07.627
It's beautiful in here.
It's just like a hospital.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.375
- It's all oak.

22:11.205 --> 22:12.627
What's this, then?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.128
It's a stereo unit.
It's a bit delicate.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.836
- Is it?
- It's German. German.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.338
There's no buttons on it.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.265
Well, it's voice-activated.
Don't... Sorry...

22:22.341 --> 22:25.015
- Poppy.
- You all right, Banjo?

22:25.094 --> 22:26.516
Are you in there?

22:36.647 --> 22:38.866
- Tina?
- What?

22:38.941 --> 22:41.490
Have you had all the Senokot?

22:42.278 --> 22:44.952
- No.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.502
- Hello.
- Hi. My name's Chalid Sulinan.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.505
I work for CACSA,
raising money for child soldiers.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.052
No.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.638
- Aren't you naughty?

23:01.714 --> 23:04.638
Okay. I have got some...

23:05.342 --> 23:07.060
Poppy. Come on!

23:09.013 --> 23:12.358
She's... She's like that.
Come on! Yeah!

23:12.600 --> 23:15.103
You're distracting me now, Poppy.
Go on.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.452
Oh, my God! Tina!

23:25.863 --> 23:27.831
Poppy.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.777
Do you mind not opening that one?
Sorry, do you mind not opening that one?

23:32.202 --> 23:33.624
God... No!

23:35.039 --> 23:36.882
We don't give him junk food!

23:43.547 --> 23:45.140
Poor boy.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.559
- Cheap crisps are full of horrors.
- I know.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.855
It'll be nice when you've
decorated it a bit, this place.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.183
Oh, well, we don't like clutter.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.938
No, no, no, you don't want clutter.

23:55.017 --> 24:00.820
You just want some plants and cushions
and pictures and a tablecloth there.

24:00.898 --> 24:04.823
Yeah, well, that would be clutter,
though, wouldn't it?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.252
I'm really sorry about that.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.171
Sorry, sorry.
That's really embarrassing.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.920
- Never mind.
- Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.385
It's fine.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.843
Uh, you'll have to pop over
to Dingley Dell sometime.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.851
But, uh, if the caravan's rockin',
don't come a-knockin'.

24:32.930 --> 24:37.231
Ha. Um, we're pretty intent
on doing some serious walking.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.529
I'm writing a book.
<i>Walks Along the Ley Lines of Britain.</i>

24:40.604 --> 24:43.198
Actually, it's his third, so...

24:43.273 --> 24:45.571
I'm out at the crack of dawn,
having a reconnoitre.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.528
Yeah. Are you?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.836
Do you think they liked us?

24:59.123 --> 25:00.545
Ian and Janice.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.005
Chris?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.593
Are you all right?

25:12.052 --> 25:13.804
I didn't like their caravan.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.490
<i>Um, we're pretty intent
on doing some serious walking.</i>

26:06.565 --> 26:08.317
<i>- I'm writing a book.
- Chris.</i>

26:08.358 --> 26:09.826
Walks Along the Ley Lines
of Britain.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.704
<i>- Actually, it's his third.
- Are you all right?</i>

26:13.030 --> 26:15.658
<i>We're pretty intent
on doing some serious walking.</i>

26:15.741 --> 26:18.870
<i>I'm writing a book.</i>
Walks Along the Ley Lines of Britain.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.635
<i>- Actually, it's his third.
- Do you think they liked us?</i>

26:21.663 --> 26:23.944
<i>- I'm out at the crack of dawn.
- Ian and Janice.</i>

26:28.337 --> 26:30.840
<i>- I'm writing a book.</i>

26:43.769 --> 26:45.612
Chris.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.066
Chris!

28:18.322 --> 28:19.665
Poppy!

28:36.882 --> 28:38.304
Chris!

28:55.442 --> 28:57.160
My God, what is it?

28:57.861 --> 29:02.037
Shamans. They sacrificed
Mr Grant's chickens to the goddess Kali.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.666
Chris, you've got some on you.

29:07.454 --> 29:10.674
Oh, sorry, yeah.
No, I'll get cleaned up in a minute.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.544
Hey, Blue John Cavern
opens in 45 minutes.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.547
I was thinking we should
give another campsite a go tonight.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.219
This one's gone downhill.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.147
So how many chickens have you got?

29:34.022 --> 29:36.866
Now I've only got nine,
but I had twelve.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.074
Barbara, Margot...

29:41.655 --> 29:44.704
and the cockerel...
Ronnie Wood.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.209
Ian!

29:50.080 --> 29:51.548
Ian!

29:52.416 --> 29:55.545
We might be able to fit in, uh,
Fountains Abbey.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.722
Banjo! What's wrong?

30:03.510 --> 30:04.887
Where's your mummy?

30:05.512 --> 30:08.265
What's happened? Eh?

30:09.099 --> 30:10.567
Chris, look.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.070
What's that?

30:14.938 --> 30:17.441
Banjo says his mummy's
a mean, horrible bitch

30:17.566 --> 30:19.113
and he wants to come with us.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.739
Oh, I don't think that would be fair
on Ian and Janice.

30:22.779 --> 30:26.283
Banjo?
We don't care about being fair, do we?

30:26.908 --> 30:30.629
No. We just care about being happy.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.624
Bloody things I do for you, love.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.596
There we go.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.300
Stay!

30:47.095 --> 30:49.097
Say one fucking word and it's...

30:52.934 --> 30:56.814
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, Chris. Go, go. Go. Go.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.574
Oh, no, Chris, it's Janice.

30:59.608 --> 31:03.283
No. Banjo, down. Down, Banjo.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.825
Ian!

31:06.615 --> 31:07.992
Ian!

32:05.173 --> 32:06.595
Chris?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.347
Chris.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.141
You getting anything?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.351
You getting any inspiration?

32:18.186 --> 32:19.859
- Chris.
- Hang on.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.657
- Chris. Chris.
- Shut up, will you?

32:22.691 --> 32:24.284
- Taste that.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.111
If you haven't started the book yet,

32:26.194 --> 32:29.494
then you might as well
write it about something else.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.329
- Fuck!
- What?

32:31.366 --> 32:33.664
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- What is it?

32:34.870 --> 32:38.374
Every time I think I've found my oeuvre,
someone shits on it.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.209
Well, I wouldn't shit on you, Chris.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.635
Not unless you asked me to.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.384
Everyone else seems to find it
so easy to express themselves.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.381
I mean, even you've got your knitting,
haven't you?

32:46.465 --> 32:49.969
But the thing is, Chris,
I'm your muse now.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.974
And we've got Banjo.

32:52.053 --> 32:55.398
So everything will be perfect.
You just need to be a bit more patient.

32:56.016 --> 32:59.987
- There's something in me, Tina.
- I'll help you squeeze it out.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.614
- Choose anything you like, love.
<i>- Anything?</i>

33:02.689 --> 33:05.408
<i>Anything you like,
as long as it's under 10 quid.</i>

33:05.484 --> 33:06.906
How much is that?

33:09.321 --> 33:12.040
- 60 quid.
- No, you can't have that.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.746
I need walking boots, don't I?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.248
Well, we'll get
the walking boots as well.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.581
You want a good tread.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.086
Okay.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.883
- You heard about the man, didn't you?
- No.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.345
He slipped on the crag
and went off the cliff yesterday.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.393
- Did you not hear about that?
- No! Did he hurt himself?

33:31.426 --> 33:33.929
Head smashed like a pumpkin.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.853
That's why I'd never have
stone flooring.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.106
Although I do love
that French farmhouse look.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.607
Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it,

33:41.686 --> 33:43.847
when people don't have respect
for the power of nature?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.448
Can't find his dog.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.744
Well, it probably committed suicide.
Dogs will do that.

33:48.777 --> 33:52.452
Tina, why don't you try these?
Look. Give them a go.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.539
Oh, Chris.
- Eh? Why not?

34:39.494 --> 34:43.168
I've got some sad news.
It's about your father.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.670
He's dead.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.437
Hey. Don't dwell on it.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.988
- How'd it go?
- I had a word.

35:07.564 --> 35:08.986
How'd he take it?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.988
Well, he's all right.
He's a bit shaken but...

35:11.067 --> 35:13.570
- Is he?
- Come on. Come on.

35:14.029 --> 35:17.704
This was a 13th-century ruin
founded by monks.

35:18.325 --> 35:22.580
Yeah, maybe I should do
an abbot detective story or something.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.423
What do you think
happened to Ian, Chris?

35:26.583 --> 35:28.210
- Chris?
- Huh?

35:28.293 --> 35:29.840
Chris.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.551
- What do you think happened to Ian?
- What?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.849
Do you think Banjo
had something to do with it?

35:40.639 --> 35:43.768
Well, yeah, he's probably capable.
He's an animal, isn't he?

35:43.850 --> 35:47.980
Do you think he might have pushed him?
'Cause he was an abused dog.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.026
There might be, uh, blood
on the paws of that dog,

35:53.109 --> 35:56.329
but it's smug complacency
that killed Ian, I tell you that.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.038
Janice looked frigid as well,
didn't she?

36:09.584 --> 36:11.632
Chris, look, it's coming out.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.517
<i>I'm a monk.</i>

36:20.512 --> 36:23.186
<i>Well, who's this little chap?
Let's have a look.</i>

36:23.264 --> 36:24.686
Oh, Poppy.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.736
- Oh, you're sweet, aren't you?

36:27.811 --> 36:29.404
This is Barney.
Barney, come and say hello.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.119
<i>- Barney.</i>
<i>- Come and say hello.</i>

36:31.189 --> 36:32.736
Say hello to Barney.

36:32.816 --> 36:36.946
- Aw! They love each other. Don't they?
- Well, they're a bit shy.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.703
Yeah, well, often it's like that
when it's love at first sight.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.375
- Isn't it, Chris?
- What?

36:42.450 --> 36:45.091
- It's like you and me when we met.
<i>- They're not fighting, anyway.</i>

36:45.120 --> 36:47.669
- Speechless. Yeah, speechless.
- Speechless, yeah.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.426
Look at that graffiti there.
"Rob loves Kerry."

37:00.593 --> 37:03.062
My husband's researching for his book.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.560
Oh, really?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.983
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.685
Actually, it's his third.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.896
You've certainly picked
an interesting spot.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.652
Are you staying nearby?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.153
Well, actually we're mobile.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.625
Oh, God, Chris,
this is just how I imagined it.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.958
For Christ's sake!

38:06.618 --> 38:08.336
- Get off!
- What did I do?

38:08.411 --> 38:10.084
Not you. Bloody Banjo.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.631
Poppy!

38:11.706 --> 38:13.629
He's a fuckin' pervert.

38:18.254 --> 38:22.509
Get in there. Get in there.
Go on, Banjo. Get in the bloody car.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.256
Chris?

38:59.921 --> 39:01.343
Come on.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.857
- I can fly!
- Whoa!

39:11.474 --> 39:13.272
I can fly, Chris.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.650
- Whoo!
- Whoo-whoo!

39:20.066 --> 39:23.445
Chris? Which button do I press?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.615
Oh, it's okay, I've done it.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.288
Yeah, Poppy!

39:32.954 --> 39:35.082
Chris, there's quite
a nice one of you here.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.087
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.802
Whoo!

39:40.253 --> 39:43.006
Chris, these are a bit saucy,
these ones.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.987
This is not my vagina!

39:58.688 --> 40:01.111
This is not my vagina!

40:01.816 --> 40:03.238
I don't know what you mean.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.537
Janice doesn't look
very frigid to me, Chris!

40:06.613 --> 40:09.492
In fact,
she looks like a very happy girl.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.621
No, that's...

40:11.701 --> 40:14.671
No wonder, when you look at Ian.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.920
That's not Ian. That's me, that.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.502
Were you shagging Janice?

40:21.002 --> 40:23.562
- What are you talking about?
- Were you shagging Ian?

40:23.630 --> 40:25.883
- Don't be stupid.
- Were you shagging both of them?

40:25.965 --> 40:27.967
- Ah, come on.
- Are you gay?

40:28.051 --> 40:31.430
- What? You know I'm not gay.
- Why are they at a wedding?

40:31.512 --> 40:32.559
What wedding?

40:32.639 --> 40:36.018
Did you go to a wedding
with Ian and Janice, Chris?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.977
- I didn't.
- Was...

40:42.565 --> 40:44.158
What's going on here?

40:44.233 --> 40:45.906
I wouldn't look. Don't.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.614
Did you kill Ian?

40:52.492 --> 40:54.460
Yeah. Well, I mean...

40:55.995 --> 40:57.713
Why'd you do that?

40:58.539 --> 41:01.133
I didn't mean to.
It was just an accident.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.220
And that just happened.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.389
Can't do things like that.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.222
It's gonna ruin the holiday.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.637
I just did... I did that for you.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.075
<i>The council had fought an injunction</i>

41:29.153 --> 41:32.248
<i>to remove Mr Andrews
and begun proceedings to evict him.</i>

41:32.281 --> 41:34.283
<i>The house has been condemned,
as it was erected</i>

41:34.409 --> 41:36.912
<i>without proper planning permission.</i>

41:37.662 --> 41:39.505
<i>Police now think that Ian Worthing,</i>

41:39.580 --> 41:42.424
<i>whose body was found at the base
of a Yorkshire crag yesterday,</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:46.596
<i>could have killed himself
because of mounting financial pressures.</i>

41:48.089 --> 41:50.683
- Oh! Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.931
- No wife?
- No, no, she's, uh...

41:53.011 --> 41:54.763
she's back at the, uh, caravan tonight.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.272
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.774
- Yeah, so's Joan.
- Is she? Yeah, yeah.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.478
We both said what a nice couple
we thought you were.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.276
Oh, did you? Oh, that's very nice.
Cheers, yeah.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.983
Yeah, no, I love her. Yeah.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.361
<i>Yeah, we're in love.</i>

42:11.779 --> 42:13.372
Yeah, I love her.

42:26.961 --> 42:32.218
<i>Hi, Chris, it's me. It's... It's Tina.
I'm just, um...</i>

42:32.884 --> 42:35.137
I'm just having fun in the caravan.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.641
<i>Um...</i>

42:37.305 --> 42:40.058
<i>I'm just wondering where you are.</i>

42:41.350 --> 42:45.821
<i>It's very cosy,
and I've made some dinner.</i>

42:47.315 --> 42:48.692
<i>Come back?</i>

43:08.586 --> 43:11.009
Ooh, steady. Are you okay?

43:11.089 --> 43:12.511
Yeah.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.513
Got a bit carried away.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.272
- I'll get the car in the morning.
- Come on. There you go.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.901
- Thanks for bringing him back, Richard.
- Oh, pleasure.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.769
- You take it easy.
- You're a legend, mate.

43:24.852 --> 43:26.695
Good luck with the ley lines.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.527
Yeah. See you, mate.

43:32.860 --> 43:36.364
Oh, I think I've got a ley line
running through my head.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.802
I thought you'd gone.

44:08.020 --> 44:11.194
Chris, Poppy's stopping.

44:11.941 --> 44:14.069
Poppy's stopping, Chris.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.196
Yeah, good girl.

44:17.238 --> 44:19.115
Aw! You having a little poo? Well done.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.710
Excuse me.
You are going to pick that up?

44:22.743 --> 44:24.370
Well, I haven't, I've... Chris?

44:24.412 --> 44:27.757
This is a site of natural beauty
and geographical interest.

44:27.874 --> 44:30.252
I think you need to sort that out.

44:30.793 --> 44:33.888
- I didn't do that.
- Uh, you need to pick it up.

44:34.088 --> 44:37.137
- I can't... Well, I can't.
- Why? Why can't you?

44:37.550 --> 44:39.590
Well, I haven't got the proper things
to do it with.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.222
Why didn't you bring the proper things
with you if you're out with your dog?

44:42.263 --> 44:43.981
Well, I did bring the proper things...

44:44.098 --> 44:46.100
...but I'm not having a very good day.

44:46.142 --> 44:47.610
- Good morning.
- Chris.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.613
- Good morning.
- He's told me I've got to pick that up

44:50.646 --> 44:52.944
- with my fingers.
- Well, a dog does a shit.

44:53.065 --> 44:54.825
You know, you can't do much
about that, mate.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.660
You can pick it up
and you take it away with you.

44:56.777 --> 44:59.280
Well, I would have the bags,
but they're in the bloody car

44:59.322 --> 45:02.326
that you've left, drunk,
outside some pub that we can't...

45:02.450 --> 45:04.669
- We don't even know where the pub is.
- Tina, I know where the car is.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.332
- No, you don't.
- I do. I know where it is.

45:06.454 --> 45:08.627
- We are lost, Chris! Lost!
- I know where it is.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.466
- I know... Look, Tina.
- You don't.

45:10.499 --> 45:12.843
Look, I'm sorry, but if you don't
pick up this excrement immediately,

45:12.960 --> 45:14.633
then I'm gonna have to inform
the National Trust.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.110
Actually, do you know what?
I don't think you are sorry, mate.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.804
I don't think you're sorry, either.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.468
- Did he touch you?
- What?

45:21.302 --> 45:23.805
- Don't know. Wasn't concentrating.
- Have a think.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.693
Can you remember everything?

45:28.851 --> 45:31.274
Uh, yes. Yes, he did touch me.

45:31.312 --> 45:34.486
- Oh... This is preposterous!
- What else did he do?

45:35.149 --> 45:38.119
He, urn...
- Details.

45:38.152 --> 45:42.783
...tried to put
Poppy's bails in his mouth.

45:43.115 --> 45:46.494
- Did you go to a private school?
- That is totally irrelevant, but yes.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.879
Yeah, I thought so. It's the tone.
It's the entitlement you got...

45:48.996 --> 45:50.373
I'm entitled to walk
in the countryside...

45:50.498 --> 45:52.045
- Yeah, you're superior.
- ...without having to encounter

45:52.166 --> 45:53.668
- dog excrement.
- You're not entitled

45:53.709 --> 45:55.882
- to be a bloody bully, mate...
- Put your stick down, for starters.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.676
- ...bullying my girlfriend.
- Leave the turd where it is.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.181
I will point this stick at you!

45:59.215 --> 46:00.683
They still think
it's their country, don't they?

46:00.716 --> 46:02.684
It should be for people
that at least respect the countryside.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.220
See how far his A level
in Classics gets him

46:04.345 --> 46:06.665
- when China owns the whole of the UK.
- People like you...

46:09.684 --> 46:13.860
<i>"And did those feet
in ancient time"</i>

46:14.397 --> 46:18.197
<i>"Walk upon England's mountains green"</i>

46:43.718 --> 46:45.686
Report that to the National Trust, mate.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.943
You know, 300 years ago

46:53.060 --> 46:56.735
his ancestor would have strode
down a path just like this, you know,

46:56.856 --> 46:59.537
and he'd have seen some common strumpet
like you and he'd have gone,

46:59.567 --> 47:01.069
"I'm gonna have a bit of that."

47:01.402 --> 47:04.030
And I'd have had to have stood by
and watched him.

47:04.071 --> 47:07.746
'Cause I'd have been a serf and he'd
have been the bloody lord of the manor.

47:07.867 --> 47:10.086
And they call them "the good old days".

47:10.161 --> 47:11.708
<i>I suppose.</i>

47:13.205 --> 47:16.709
If you look at it that way,
you were defending my honour.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.509
Oh, don't thank me,
thank the democratic process.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.888
Never thought about murdering
innocent people like that before.

47:27.928 --> 47:31.398
Ah, he's not a person, Tina,
he's a <i>Daily Mail</i> reader.

47:31.932 --> 47:35.027
Perspective.
Grab it with both hands, it's free.

47:35.895 --> 47:38.193
See if he's got any sandwiches.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.948
Oh, thank Christ.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.615
Fucking hell.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.583
I know, get your notebook out.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.290
- Huh?
- Get your notebook out.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.797
Come on, write down your ideas.

47:58.876 --> 48:02.926
Just write down what's happened and
all your feelings and stuff like that.

48:02.963 --> 48:04.636
- Yeah?
- Mmm!

48:04.715 --> 48:06.638
- All right.
- Go on, get it down.

48:06.759 --> 48:08.261
Oh, my God, Chris.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.763
I'm musing.

48:11.722 --> 48:15.647
I'm musing right now. Do you feel it?

48:18.229 --> 48:20.152
My God, I feel amazing.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.151
Christ, that was hard.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.828
I don't think I'll get
anything more out today.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.656
I think you've found your oeuvre, Chris.

48:31.826 --> 48:33.624
You're not gonna tell, are you?

48:35.955 --> 48:37.332
No.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.349
What are you looking at me
like that for?

48:48.050 --> 48:50.394
This will put 'em off the scent.

48:52.471 --> 48:53.848
Come on, give us a hand.

49:37.183 --> 49:39.402
Mother Shipton's Cave!

49:48.027 --> 49:51.201
If you could wish for anything,
what would it be?

49:51.780 --> 49:54.875
Well, if I tell you, Chris,
it won't come true.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.958
I just wanna be feared and respected.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.586
It's not too much to ask
from life, is it?

50:13.469 --> 50:15.597
Can't look at that any more.

50:17.806 --> 50:21.310
<i>The man found dead
yesterday at the Kimberly Stone Circle</i>

50:21.435 --> 50:24.439
<i>has been identified as Anthony Breal.</i>

50:24.480 --> 50:27.154
<i>Police are treating the death

50:27.274 --> 50:30.323
<i>and are looking for a culprit

50:30.444 --> 50:33.118
<i>as a dangerous sexual predator.</i>

51:40.681 --> 51:42.683
What do you think of this?

51:42.766 --> 51:47.021
Ah, that is very nice.
Very nice indeed.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.282
Hey, turn round. Turn round.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.113
Why?

51:57.364 --> 51:59.082
- There you go.
- Ooh!

51:59.199 --> 52:01.201
- What do you think? Eh?
- It's an owl.

52:01.243 --> 52:02.711
It's nice, innit?

52:08.751 --> 52:10.219
Excuse me.

52:12.379 --> 52:13.756
Sorry, mate.

52:13.881 --> 52:16.725
Guys! Dinner in five minutes!

52:46.747 --> 52:49.626
All right, mate?
Not seen one of these before.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.297
It's a prototype.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.967
Yeah, all the things that...
You know, all your practical stuff,

52:54.088 --> 52:55.931
you keep down at the end by your feet.

52:55.964 --> 52:57.682
Do you? Is that where you've got
your toolbox and stuff?

52:57.758 --> 53:00.511
Yeah, yeah, I keep it down there,
like our wind-up torch and that,

53:00.594 --> 53:02.437
- and, uh, my stove.
- Yeah?

53:02.471 --> 53:03.939
Chris!

53:04.682 --> 53:06.104
I'm ready!

53:06.183 --> 53:09.403
...glass fibre epoxy struts,
as used in spacecraft extendable masts.

53:09.478 --> 53:10.900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.856
- I'm Chris, by the way.
- I'm Martin. Nice to meet you.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.692
- Yeah, nice to meet you. Yeah.
- Yeah, you.

53:14.775 --> 53:16.743
- Yeah, I was in plastics.
- Was ya?

53:16.819 --> 53:18.366
Yeah, extrusion blow moulding.

53:18.445 --> 53:20.365
No. Cor, they're given an hard time,
ain't they?

53:20.406 --> 53:22.704
But, here, let's face it,
they're here to stay, mate.

53:22.783 --> 53:24.251
Yeah, preaching to the choir, mate.

53:24.326 --> 53:26.749
Right, yeah, yeah. Nice one. Yeah.

53:27.496 --> 53:29.498
It looks like an alien's coffin.

53:29.581 --> 53:32.630
I call it the Carapod. You know,
what with the ground displacement

53:32.710 --> 53:35.008
of persons due to the instability
of geopolitics,

53:35.087 --> 53:39.092
I'm hoping that this will become a whole
new way of living for economic migrants.

53:39.174 --> 53:41.643
We're trying a whole new way of living.
Aren't we, Chris?

53:41.719 --> 53:43.439
- Oh, are you?
- Tina hasn't travelled much.

53:43.470 --> 53:47.475
Right, right, yeah. I hear you.
Hey, uh, you back later for a beer?

53:47.558 --> 53:49.151
Oh, I don't really drink much but, um,

53:49.226 --> 53:50.694
always up for a bit of smoke,
if you know what I mean.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.362
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Great.

53:52.438 --> 53:53.860
- Nice one.
- Cheers, Martin.

53:53.939 --> 53:55.361
- Cheers. Chris?
- Yeah.

53:55.441 --> 53:56.909
Yeah. Take care.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.746
Right.

54:14.168 --> 54:17.138
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
One in the pink,

54:17.254 --> 54:18.722
- one on the sink!
<i>- One on the sink!</i>

54:18.797 --> 54:21.175
- It's crazy, this.
- Thank you.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.931
- Madam.

54:23.385 --> 54:26.104
Thank you very much.
Uh, can I just ask you, actually,

54:26.180 --> 54:28.182
I've got this, er...
I've got this voucher

54:28.265 --> 54:30.393
- that I picked up about a week ago.
- Oh, right.

54:31.477 --> 54:35.482
Hey, that dress looks a lot better
on you than it did on your mother.

54:37.941 --> 54:40.490
I haven't got any knickers on.

54:44.198 --> 54:46.951
Oh, dear, it looks like
your knife's fallen off the table.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.709
I'll just have to go and pick it up.

54:51.455 --> 54:53.878
I might be five minutes or so.

55:02.841 --> 55:04.559
Can't see anything.

55:06.220 --> 55:07.972
Well, I'm wearing tights.

55:08.055 --> 55:10.023
You know all that stuff
that's been happening, you know...

55:10.098 --> 55:11.771
It's all right, Chris.

55:11.850 --> 55:15.946
It's all right,
because I understand you.

55:16.855 --> 55:18.528
- And I know you...
- Do you?

55:18.607 --> 55:23.158
...and I get it, 'cause it's just about
personal empowerment, isn't it?

55:23.237 --> 55:27.413
It's just expressing yourself
and thinking outside the box.

55:27.491 --> 55:31.621
And I've been in a box.
I don't wanna go back to the box, Chris.

55:32.704 --> 55:35.082
I'd rather die. Do you know that?

55:35.749 --> 55:37.171
You'd rather die?

55:37.584 --> 55:42.055
Yeah. How romantic would that be?
If we both just died together.

55:42.130 --> 55:46.681
Well, I mean, going to salsa's romantic.
We could maybe try that first.

55:46.885 --> 55:50.014
What you're doing is
you're giving to the world.

55:50.389 --> 55:52.232
Take carbon footprints.

55:52.391 --> 55:55.895
By reducing people's lifespans,

55:55.978 --> 55:58.481
technically,
you're reducing their emissions.

56:00.858 --> 56:04.783
What, so you're saying that...
murder is green?

56:07.072 --> 56:09.996
Hmm, I hadn't thought of it like that.
Thanks.

56:16.248 --> 56:18.922
- This beard turns me on, Chris.
- I love it when you do that.

56:20.836 --> 56:23.385
- Ginger-minger!

56:26.383 --> 56:28.511
What's the favourite thing I like to do?

56:28.594 --> 56:30.688
Yeah. With me.

56:31.305 --> 56:33.185
- Oh, well, that's obvious, innit?

56:33.265 --> 56:35.609
- Put the bins out.

56:36.810 --> 56:41.236
I like to put the bins out... in my pants
and then have you come over

56:41.940 --> 56:44.363
and rub bin juice all over me leg.

56:44.443 --> 56:46.411
What's bin juice?

56:46.486 --> 56:48.079
You know, that bit that you get
at the bottom of the bin

56:48.155 --> 56:49.875
- when all that stuff drips out.
- Oh, yeah.

56:51.491 --> 56:53.131
- That was Dave!
- Wasn't his real name...

57:04.087 --> 57:05.589
Don't be sick.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.054
You Okay?

57:24.441 --> 57:26.819
Nine, eight, seven,

57:27.402 --> 57:32.374
six, five, four, three, two, one!

57:38.205 --> 57:39.798
Do you wanna have sex with all us?

57:42.876 --> 57:45.004
Ooh!
It's just a bit of fun.

57:46.838 --> 57:49.307
Get off, that's enough. That's enough.

57:50.008 --> 57:52.010
Getting married, are you?

57:52.344 --> 57:53.721
- Yeah.
- Are you?

57:53.845 --> 57:55.222
I am. Aren't we?

57:57.307 --> 57:59.685
What would your fiancé
think of this, then, eh?

57:59.726 --> 58:01.228
He'd love it.

58:04.398 --> 58:06.196
- I'm gonna go and pay the bill now.
- No, let me pay.

58:06.233 --> 58:07.906
Sit down! Sit!

58:08.652 --> 58:10.074
Stay!

58:17.744 --> 58:19.917
<i>In a minute!</i>

59:14.801 --> 59:18.647
Nine, eight, seven, six,

59:18.764 --> 59:22.644
five, four, three, two, one!

59:59.971 --> 01:00:01.644
I'd never do that.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:05.519
Do what?

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.021
Chailey!

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:08.856
Chailey Morris!

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.733
Chailey!

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.318
- Chailey!
- Chailey!

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.205
She's not texting back.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.200
- Chailey!
- Chailey!

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.215
Oh, for Christ's sake, Banjo,
you've pissed the bed.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.305
Poppy.
- Disgusting.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.411
Where's that necklace?

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.949
I'm sure I had it
when we got back from the restaurant.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.958
Well, that's what happens
when you go off schedule.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.294
Chris, are we going
to the Pencil Museum now?

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:49.168
Actually, I told Martin
I'd help with modifications

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.666
to the Carapod this morning.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.713
But we scheduled the Pencil Museum.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.794
Well, it's my turn to go off schedule.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.717
Fine.

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.642
Come on, Poppy.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:03.637
Come on. Come on, Poppy.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.226
Come on, Poppy.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.227
Poppy! Poppy! Poppy!

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:14.482
Come on. Come on, Poppy.

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:22.326
Well, fuck you, then.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.714
How long have you two
been together, then?

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.841
Uh, about three months.

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.181
Still getting on all right?

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:43.014
Yeah.
Sex life's fucking fantastic, mate.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.849
- Is it?
- Better than ever.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.601
- Fair play, mate.
- Yeah.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.435
She don't mind you smoking a bit
of the old herb every now and again?

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:52.770
No, she don't care about that.

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:54.863
She doesn't like me drinking

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.194
and she doesn't like me doing her
up the bumhole.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:02.701
<i>Legend has it
that in the early 1500s,</i>

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:06.204
<i>a violent storm
in the Borrowdale area of Cumberland</i>

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.411
<i>led to trees being uprooted</i>

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:12.039
<i>and the discovery
of a strange black material underneath.</i>

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:15.546
<i>This material turned out to be graphite.</i>

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:21.552
<i>A cottage industry of pencil-making
soon developed,</i>

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:27.562
<i>culminating in the formation of
the UK's first pencil factory in 1832.</i>

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.149
<i>The factory has had various owners...</i>

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.896
And then like this, sort of disco style.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.834
Excuse me. How much is that big pencil?

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.331
£24.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.178
Go. Fast as you can.

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:13.517
- Oh, mate. You all right?

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.317
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Bloody hell, mate.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.486
<i>Banjo.</i>

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.734
- Banjo. Banjo, get away.
- Ugh!

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.444
Go!

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:31.578
<i>...becoming
the Cumberland Pencil Company in 1916.</i>

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:36.798
<i>The Lakeland children's range
was launched in 1930,</i>

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:41.879
<i>followed by the Derwent brand
of fine art pencils in...</i>

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.306
How did you decide on the size of this
when you were originally...

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.305
Oh, from a P&O ferry.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.109
<i>...canteen building,</i>

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:04.068
<i>and advertisements were placed
in newspapers,</i>

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.699
<i>seeking artefacts and memorabilia.</i>

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:12.159
<i>The famous Pencil Museum...</i>

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.764
Mum.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.387
Is that you, Tina?

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:29.888
Oh, Mum.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.681
- Has it gone wrong?
- No.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:36.728
Yes.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:39.186
Yeah, a bit, sort of.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.650
Shall I come? No, I can't. I'm too ill.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:47.201
I don't know what he wants.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.737
Oh, they're all the same.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:52.290
Whatever you give him,
he'll want the opposite.

01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:55.414
I've done things.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.587
Ooh, Tina. What?

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.506
What have you done, love?

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.469
Sex things?

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.554
And other stuff.

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:12.310
Because I thought that was what
he wanted to see me do, you know?

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.768
But now I'm not sure.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:19.230
You didn't let him see you do
number twos, did you, Tina?

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.607
Never.

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:25.983
Mystery, Tina, is a woman's sanctuary.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.950
Bye, now,
'cause I've got stuff to do.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.410
Mum.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.869
Poppy's with the babysitter.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.492
Don't call him that.

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.832
Make love to me, Chris.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.840
No, I can't. I'm still processing.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:25.337
Please.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:29.341
That poor girl. She was getting married.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.007
Just the thought of that
just makes me feel...

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.513
Sexy.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:39.014
Ruined that restaurant for me.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.688
I've been very bad, Chris.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.613
I think you should punish me.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.782
With your cock.

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:53.202
Tina. It's not sexy. It was wrong.

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:55.743
You're not qualified.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.537
Fine!

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:12.054
What are you doing?

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.425
Finishing what you started.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.868
<i>...have been
at their highest for a decade.</i>

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:35.062
<i>There have been grim warnings that the
country could return to the dark days...</i>

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.500
Oh, what the fuck?

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.716
Pull over!

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.724
Fucking hell.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.518
Morning, Chris.
- Pull over now!

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.023
- Oh.
<i>- What the hell are you doing?</i>

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.059
I thought I'd give you a lie-in.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.486
<i>A lie-in? Pull over now!</i>

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.234
- Fine.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.157
Oh, Christ.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:22.416
Aw. It reminds me
of the first day of the holiday.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.910
No, that was an accident.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:27.005
I feel a bit emotional,
'cause, you know,

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.424
it's the first one we've done together,
isn't it?

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.501
- Ah, you're sacked.
- What?

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.006
- You're sacked.
- What?

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:35.339
Look...
...this isn't working.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.582
Look, I don't... I don't need you.
I don't need a muse.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.433
I'm not a bloody writer, am I?

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:42.353
No, you're not. You're a serial killer.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.229
- That's what you are.
- I am not. Look, Tina,

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.688
I need structure. Organisation.
This is just chaos.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:50.520
It's not my style!
Just... All this...

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.947
Oh, I can't open the fucking door now!

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.784
You did this to me. God!

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.540
<i>You done it to yourself.</i>

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.789
- I need justification.
- Really?

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.789
- This is just murder.
- Well, maybe this is my style, Chris.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.294
- Yeah, great style.
- Maybe this is my style.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:13.468
You are really bloody stylish,
aren't you?

01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:16.383
- I know.
- Look at that! That's your style?

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.639
Look, it's nothing personal.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:21.259
It's just,
you're a negative influence on me.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:22.935
Do you know that?

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:25.813
I've done more murders
in the last fucking three days

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.482
than in the entire six months
since I got made redundant.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.310
- Redundant?
- Yes.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.983
You said you'd taken a sabbatical.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.152
It doesn't matter.
You can't help it, you're evil.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:37.992
Maybe even a witch.
Yeah, you're a witch.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.494
You're a bloody witch.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:52.378
I don't think anyone
will be able to see him.

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.897
<i>The tragic
death of bride-to-be Chailey Morris</i>

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:16.068
<i>on Tuesday is now considered
not to be an accident.</i>

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.533
<i>The police announced today
that they're pursuing</i>

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:23.413
<i>a ginger-faced man and an angry woman
in connection with inquiries.</i>

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.499
<i>It's not yet known
how the incident happened.</i>

01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:25.304
There she blows.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:27.927
Journey's end.

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:45.453
<i>Is that a hawk?</i>

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:10.909
Wonder where Martin is.
Should be here by now.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.953
Wonder where Poppy is.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.880
I hope he can find us here.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:21.378
Who, Poppy?

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.879
- No, Martin.
- Oh.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.134
Hey.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.592
Hey!

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:34.974
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.398
Picked a spectacular spot, mate!

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.894
Yeah, bit off the beaten track, innit?

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:45.235
- All right, mate?
- Yeah, I'm great, yeah.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.907
All right, love?

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:49.068
Yeah. Good.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.573
Hello, boy.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:55.117
- Poppy! There you are!
- Hello.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:59.087
Oh, Poppy. It's Mummy. Eh?

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:02.206
Come on, let's get you in the warm.

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.465
- Cheers. Cheers, yeah.
- Cheers.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:09.047
- Cheers, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Glad you made it, mate.

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:10.632
Yeah, well, it's lovely
to be here, mate.

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:15.437
You know, with a sort of marketing
strategy and a good production schedule,

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.730
I think we could
make it work, yeah. Yeah.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.682
Actually, I was thinking
of going to see this guy in Spain.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:23.235
He's got, um, some amazing ideas
about combi-power inverters.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.404
- I mean, you must know about them.
- Yeah. Oh, right, cool, yeah.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:28.198
Well, here's to Carapod International.
Eh? Cheers.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:30.868
- Cheers.
- Tina? Carapod International.

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.033
- Brilliant.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:35.535
I'm going for a piss.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.241
Yeah, yeah, fine.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:40.748
It's, uh...

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:44.128
- Sorry, it's a bit squished in here.
- Sorry. Um, just...

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.758
Yeah, he's a lovely bloke, isn't he?

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.928
Oh, honestly, I'm so happy
I bumped into you guys.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:51.677
You know, I really need
a business partner, you know,

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.508
'cause I come up with the ideas

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.390
but I'm not good
at the organisational end of things.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:16:00.599
So, you know, and, uh, I really bonded
with little Banjo over here.

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.103
Who?

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:06.438
That's his name, isn't it?
It's just that Chris said it was...

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.359
Did he?

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.901
So did I get that wrong?

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.746
Do you know what it's like
to be a woman, Martin?

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.248
Uh, no. No.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.838
I do.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.336
Fine.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.509
It's not too bad, actually.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:30.507
Yeah, I imagine, yeah, yeah.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.759
He can be very controlling.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.758
- Really? Right. I...
- Very domineering.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:39.725
- Well, he's... Yeah.
- But you're not like that, are you?

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:43.308
No, no. Me, I'm a pretty
easy-going guy really, yeah.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.688
Haven't you got lovely eyelashes?

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.611
- Have I?
- Mmm.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:50.530
- Thanks very much. Yeah.
Kiss me.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.744
Martin, did you hear me?

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.203
- Kiss me, Martin.
- Um...

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.875
Just quickly before he comes back.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.541
- All right, mate?
- All right?

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.089
- What?
- Cheers.

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:13.011
- Cheers, yeah.
- Cheers. Here's to you.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:18.388
What?

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.188
Martin just said
some filthy things to me, Chris.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:26.275
Yeah? Well, do tell.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.274
He said I was a dirty, slutty bitch.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.402
And he wanted to fuck me.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:36.702
And he said he wanted to shit
in my mouth and in my underwear,

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:42.826
and he said he wanted to shit in my hand
and make me use it as a brown lipstick.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.545
Mate, I... I...

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.084
You know,
if Martin really said these things,

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:55.968
then I've got no objection, in theory.

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:58.431
- In theory?
- Yeah.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.264
What about practice, Chris?

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.103
- Right. Um...
- Chris.

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:15.366
- Um, I'm gonna go to bed now, all right?
- I'm...

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:17.646
Yeah, it's probably best,
actually, mate. Yeah, yeah.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.616
Yeah, it's been a long day.
Yeah, yeah, so I'll just...

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.368
Yeah, I think we're probably
gonna turn in, too. So...

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.701
Yeah, can I just...
Yeah, can I just, uh...

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.286
Will you let Martin out, please?

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:34.923
Right, cheers then, yeah.
See you in the morning.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.515
Why are you behaving
like that in front of Martin?!

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.014
Why can't I have a friend?
You've got that bloody dog, Banjo!

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:46.347
- Poppy!
- It's called Banjo!

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.524
- Poppy!
- Banjo!

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.402
Just stop saying that
in front of the dog.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.104
You're giving him an identity crisis.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:57.237
How is he gonna have an identity crisis,
Chris, when he's a stupid fucking dog?

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.120
Hello? Hello? Hey!

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.756
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.367
Well, that solves that problem.

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:47.866
Oh, fuckin' God, no.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.372
No!

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:56.542
Martin?

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.844
Martin?

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.807
Martin!

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:10.389
You are a fucking liability, you are.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.192
You're a liability.
You're just like your mother.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:15.353
You can't... Ow, fucking hell.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:34.880
- Oh, you are a powder keg.

01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:08.233
So have you had a nice holiday?

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:12.246
Yeah.
I've had a brilliant holiday.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:16.041
I'm sorry about
calling you a witch and that.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:22.418
What do you reckon?
You sure this is what you want?

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:28.762
- Three...

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:30.464
- ...two...
- Two...

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:32.933
- ...one.
- ...one.

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:35.303
Go.
