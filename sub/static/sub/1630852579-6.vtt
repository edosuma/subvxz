WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:05.004
NARRATOR: For centuries,
Native Americans have kept alive

00:05.231 --> 00:07.731
some of the oldest traditions
on Earth.

00:07.824 --> 00:11.010
Through oral history
and sacred sites,

00:11.161 --> 00:16.831
the story is told to Indigenous
people for thousands of years.

00:16.925 --> 00:21.669
NARRATOR: Their incredible
history is carved into the landscape.

00:21.689 --> 00:25.024
This is sensational.
Look at that guy right there.

00:25.251 --> 00:29.603
They represent those gods
that came to Earth.

00:29.755 --> 00:34.424
NARRATOR: And their sacred
rituals display a reverence for the land

00:34.518 --> 00:37.852
and for the ancestors
from the stars.

00:37.872 --> 00:42.541
They're the keepers of the upper
world, which means space.

00:42.768 --> 00:45.044
ALFREDO FIGUEROA:
We don't use the word "gods."

00:45.195 --> 00:47.195
We use the word "creator."

00:47.214 --> 00:49.289
(speaks Native language)

00:49.383 --> 00:53.034
NARRATOR: Do the stories
of America's Indigenous people

00:53.128 --> 00:58.131
reveal a long history of contact
with otherworldly visitors?

00:58.225 --> 01:01.894
JON DOVER: All Native
American tribes have oral histories

01:02.121 --> 01:04.121
that people came from the stars
to visit them.

01:04.139 --> 01:05.314
I know they're out there.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.218
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:10.237 --> 01:13.072
in the universe.

01:13.223 --> 01:15.991
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:17.469 --> 01:19.803
It demands
we question everything

01:19.822 --> 01:22.139
we have ever been taught.

01:22.232 --> 01:25.918
The evidence is all around us.

01:26.145 --> 01:29.830
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.649
We are not alone.

01:32.668 --> 01:35.677
We have never been alone.

01:45.848 --> 01:48.590
Collinsville, Illinois.

01:48.684 --> 01:51.835
15 miles east of St. Louis.

01:51.854 --> 01:56.097
Towering over the flat
local terrain is Monks Mound,

01:56.117 --> 01:59.601
the remains
of a massive earthen pyramid.

01:59.620 --> 02:04.289
Built more than 1,000 years ago,
it was the centerpiece

02:04.441 --> 02:08.685
of the ancient Native American
city of Cahokia.

02:08.704 --> 02:13.039
Monks Mound
is the largest building

02:13.192 --> 02:16.877
of the ancient North America
north of Mexico.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.545
It was called that

02:18.639 --> 02:22.366
because Trappist French monks
lived nearby it.

02:22.459 --> 02:25.293
It stands 100 feet tall today.

02:25.387 --> 02:28.147
It was probably taller
in its heyday.

02:28.374 --> 02:34.636
It comprises of about 22 million
cubic feet of dirt,

02:34.730 --> 02:37.564
which was millions and millions

02:37.716 --> 02:41.660
of buckets of dirt
brought one at a time.

02:41.887 --> 02:44.888
Its circumference
on the bottom is larger

02:44.907 --> 02:49.918
than the Temple of the Sun
just north of Mexico City.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.674
NARRATOR: Monks Mound and
other ancient ruins across the Americas

02:55.825 --> 02:58.660
offer clues about
how Native people once lived

02:58.679 --> 03:01.421
in vast, thriving communities.

03:01.515 --> 03:05.425
Yet very little is known
about the inhabitants of Cahokia

03:05.519 --> 03:07.669
and many Native cultures

03:07.688 --> 03:10.080
since most of their history
and traditions

03:10.098 --> 03:14.026
were passed down orally rather
than through written records.

03:14.177 --> 03:17.512
The Native Americans
traditionally use

03:17.606 --> 03:19.347
a oral tradition.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.200
Everything is spoken.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.263
The oral traditions actually
go back thousands of years.

03:26.281 --> 03:27.948
It's just the way it was.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.376
And we've maintained
that tradition even to this day.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.545
(jangling)

03:35.031 --> 03:37.441
NARRATOR: It is unknown
what the Native Americans

03:37.459 --> 03:40.444
who inhabited Cahokia
called themselves.

03:40.462 --> 03:44.205
Anthropologists refer to them
as the Mississippians,

03:44.299 --> 03:48.285
a name used to describe
a wide variety of Native peoples

03:48.303 --> 03:51.897
that lived east of the
Mississippi in North America.

03:53.308 --> 03:57.627
And although much about Cahokia
remains a mystery,

03:57.721 --> 03:59.980
what is known is that it thrived

04:00.074 --> 04:03.391
centuries before Europeans ever
stepped foot in the Americas,

04:03.410 --> 04:06.328
as did countless other cities.

04:07.564 --> 04:09.397
BARNHART:
Around 1050,

04:09.416 --> 04:14.586
the city swells
to a population of 15,000,

04:14.738 --> 04:17.238
and including the satellite
communities around it,

04:17.258 --> 04:19.240
almost 30,000.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.409
There were a number
of these cities

04:21.503 --> 04:25.171
all around the eastern part
of what's now the United States.

04:25.266 --> 04:31.603
The general picture of Native
America before European contact

04:31.830 --> 04:34.347
is that it's some sort
of just nomadic life,

04:34.500 --> 04:38.777
that they were living
in small bands and camps.

04:39.004 --> 04:41.505
The truth is that there were
thousands of people

04:41.523 --> 04:42.948
living in the same place,

04:43.099 --> 04:45.575
very much the way
the Europeans were.

04:48.347 --> 04:50.363
NARRATOR:
Across North America,

04:50.457 --> 04:53.366
vast differences existed
between the Native peoples

04:53.460 --> 04:57.629
in terms of language, customs
and cultural practices.

04:57.856 --> 05:00.966
Yet many tribes
shared the tradition

05:01.117 --> 05:04.136
of worshipping a powerful being
known as the Bird Man.

05:04.363 --> 05:06.287
(hawk cries)

05:06.381 --> 05:10.958
When excavations were performed
at Cahokia in the 20th century,

05:11.053 --> 05:13.895
this motif was found
to be abundant.

05:15.207 --> 05:17.298
The most remarkable example

05:17.318 --> 05:20.134
was connected to the burial
of a man believed to have been

05:20.154 --> 05:22.062
an early Cahokian ruler.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.549
His body had been placed
on an elevated platform

05:25.567 --> 05:29.719
covered by a bed of more than
20,000 marine shell disc beads

05:29.813 --> 05:32.222
arranged in the shape
of a falcon,

05:32.315 --> 05:34.574
with the bird's head
appearing beneath

05:34.726 --> 05:36.743
and beside the man's head

05:36.895 --> 05:40.255
and its wings and tail
beneath his arms and legs.

05:41.416 --> 05:43.842
The Bird Man of Cahokia
is a burial

05:43.993 --> 05:47.346
that was found under a mound
in the center of the city.

05:48.924 --> 05:51.016
And it's called the Bird Man

05:51.243 --> 05:54.669
because there's
this arrangement of shells

05:54.688 --> 05:59.524
that appear to be
in the shape of a bird.

05:59.676 --> 06:04.087
And it makes sense because
we know that the Mississippians

06:04.106 --> 06:09.350
had a supernatural being
who may or may not be a god.

06:09.444 --> 06:12.429
But he's
a very powerful creature

06:12.447 --> 06:14.873
that lives up in the sky.

06:15.100 --> 06:19.628
We see depictions
on also stone tablets.

06:22.124 --> 06:26.176
JONATHAN YOUNG: Native people believed
in the power deity called the Bird Man.

06:27.537 --> 06:31.297
There are a number
of depictions in the remains

06:31.450 --> 06:34.226
of these cultures
of this powerful creature

06:34.377 --> 06:37.211
who could fly and could move
among the different realms

06:37.305 --> 06:41.975
and was essentially the ruling,
uh, god of this reality.

06:42.127 --> 06:45.145
- (hawk cries) - NARRATOR:
Various descriptions of the Bird Man

06:45.297 --> 06:48.632
can be found
from one tradition to the next,

06:48.650 --> 06:51.726
and some also feature
a similar celestial being

06:51.820 --> 06:55.062
called the thunderbird.

06:55.157 --> 06:57.323
The thunderbird, uh, in Zuni

06:57.418 --> 07:02.570
is described as a being
that came from the sky

07:02.664 --> 07:05.406
that could create lightning.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.575
It could create a lot of noise.

07:07.594 --> 07:11.337
And it was represented

07:11.432 --> 07:16.268
as a being with wings
made out of knives.

07:16.419 --> 07:21.088
Now, the thunderbird
could have been a vehicle.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.943
But way back then, the Indians
had no other reference.

07:25.170 --> 07:28.021
So they just said...
(stammers) it is a bird.

07:28.173 --> 07:31.858
(bird cries)

07:31.952 --> 07:34.511
One could argue
that this is a representation

07:34.529 --> 07:36.621
of misunderstood technology

07:36.773 --> 07:39.699
that could illustrate
some type of a flying craft.

07:39.793 --> 07:45.038
Because if you don't have
the terminology for a plane,

07:45.190 --> 07:49.693
well, of course
you're gonna call it a bird.

07:49.786 --> 07:53.305
I mean, pilots even today
call their planes birds.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.477
MAHOOTY: The Mound Builders,
I believe, were those Indian tribes

07:58.704 --> 08:02.647
that had contact
with the extraterrestrials,

08:02.799 --> 08:05.225
the teachers.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.470
The star ancestors taught
the American Indians

08:09.564 --> 08:11.231
about where they came from,

08:11.383 --> 08:14.884
their different star system,
constellations,

08:14.903 --> 08:18.479
and how they're supposed
to carry out their rituals,

08:18.499 --> 08:21.407
by referring
to their star system,

08:21.560 --> 08:23.059
whether it be Pleiades,

08:23.078 --> 08:25.319
whether it be the Milky Way,

08:25.339 --> 08:28.173
whether it be the Big Dipper.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.680
We don't use the word "gods."

08:35.832 --> 08:37.757
We use the word "creator."

08:37.851 --> 08:40.426
(speaks Native language)

08:40.579 --> 08:43.522
He who has no name
and has all the names.

08:43.749 --> 08:46.274
He's the eye
that oversees everybody.

08:48.754 --> 08:52.088
PATTI ROBLES: The creation
story, if you understand it correctly,

08:52.107 --> 08:55.516
we are all from the cosmos.

08:55.610 --> 09:00.096
Our ancestors
were extraterrestrial.

09:00.189 --> 09:03.950
The story is told
to Indigenous people

09:04.044 --> 09:06.619
for thousands of years

09:06.772 --> 09:08.547
through oral history

09:08.774 --> 09:13.109
and through
the petroglyphs and pictographs

09:13.128 --> 09:17.038
and the sacred sites
that continue to be part

09:17.057 --> 09:20.225
of our Native
cultural traditions.

09:22.137 --> 09:24.545
DOVER:
In talking about star people,

09:24.565 --> 09:28.215
all Native American tribes
have these, uh, traditional

09:28.235 --> 09:31.903
oral histories that people came
from the stars to visit them.

09:32.055 --> 09:35.574
And it's universal,
all across the United States,

09:35.725 --> 09:39.077
that these gods,
as we call them today,

09:39.304 --> 09:43.973
came to Earth and visited
to provide knowledge.

09:43.992 --> 09:47.735
The Cherokee talked about,
uh, the star seeds

09:47.829 --> 09:49.662
and the people coming
from the sky.

09:49.756 --> 09:54.092
The Zunis and the Hopis talk
about the star people coming,

09:54.243 --> 09:58.746
and the Mississippi mound people
had the Bird Man culture.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.601
So, here we have these cultures,

10:02.752 --> 10:05.086
and their legends
and lores are about

10:05.180 --> 10:08.014
star ancestors coming down,

10:08.108 --> 10:12.185
giving them information, showing
them science and medicine.

10:12.337 --> 10:17.023
TSOUKALOS: Native American
people have been very clear

10:17.175 --> 10:21.678
when they speak of celestial
beings that imparted knowledge.

10:21.696 --> 10:24.438
And if you compare that
to the ancient astronaut theory,

10:24.532 --> 10:27.367
that's exactly what
it talks about,

10:27.461 --> 10:32.631
that the knowledge was imparted
by beings who visited us.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.711
NARRATOR: Could the stories
of the Bird Men and star people

10:38.864 --> 10:41.806
provide an oral history
of alien visitation

10:42.033 --> 10:44.534
among early
Native American tribes?

10:44.552 --> 10:47.646
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

10:47.797 --> 10:51.057
and propose that, while
the Indigenous communities

10:51.151 --> 10:52.984
kept no written records,

10:53.211 --> 10:55.820
a historical account
of exactly what they encountered

10:55.972 --> 10:58.564
can be found
carved into the landscape

10:58.659 --> 11:02.410
at an ancient petroglyph site
in Arizona.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.393
NARRATOR:
In the American Southwest

11:10.412 --> 11:13.062
is a region
known as the Four Corners,

11:13.081 --> 11:16.991
where the boundaries
of Arizona, New Mexico,

11:17.085 --> 11:19.493
Colorado and Utah meet.

11:19.587 --> 11:21.829
Most of this region belongs

11:21.848 --> 11:24.590
to semiautonomous
Native American nations,

11:24.685 --> 11:27.410
including the Navajo,

11:27.429 --> 11:31.856
Hopi, Zuni,

11:32.008 --> 11:35.527
Ute and dozens of other
Native American peoples.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.530
They are all thought
to be descendants

11:38.681 --> 11:43.851
of people frequently called the
Ancestral Pueblo, or Anasazi.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.687
DOVER:
The Anasazi, or the old ones,

11:46.781 --> 11:48.355
as we like to refer to them,

11:48.375 --> 11:50.600
were here
in the Four Corners region,

11:50.693 --> 11:52.952
uh, for thousands of years.

11:53.046 --> 11:58.049
And they suddenly, around
1070 AD, just up and disappear.

11:59.368 --> 12:01.627
Their cities are abandoned,

12:01.780 --> 12:03.629
their structures, everything.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.281
Pottery is left.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.058
They don't know what
happened to them.

12:10.880 --> 12:16.960
NARRATOR: Archaeological evidence
shows that, between 1275 and 1300 AD,

12:16.978 --> 12:19.629
the Pueblo people
stopped building entirely

12:19.722 --> 12:22.073
and the land was left empty.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.410
DOVER: They were
a people that inhabited

12:25.561 --> 12:30.231
this Four Corners region
for thousands of years.

12:30.325 --> 12:31.657
It's still a mystery today,

12:31.810 --> 12:33.309
and it's one
of the big mysteries

12:33.402 --> 12:34.919
in the American Southwest.

12:37.073 --> 12:39.424
NARRATOR: Similar to the
Mississippian tribes to the east,

12:39.575 --> 12:41.742
the Pueblo nations

12:41.762 --> 12:46.005
also described contact
with visitors from the stars

12:46.157 --> 12:47.991
and performed rituals

12:48.009 --> 12:51.436
to connect with sky beings
called the kachina.

12:52.847 --> 12:54.922
There were objects--
We call them dolls--

12:54.941 --> 12:57.758
But they were sacred objects
that would be similar

12:57.852 --> 13:01.446
to the costumes worn by
the dancers and imagined to be

13:01.673 --> 13:03.948
the appearance
of these celestial beings.

13:04.175 --> 13:06.676
DOVER:
If you look at the kachinas,

13:06.769 --> 13:09.028
there are
so many different types--

13:09.122 --> 13:12.273
Different headdresses,
different feathers on them,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.183
different ways of painting them

13:14.277 --> 13:16.777
to distinguish them
one from another.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.946
And that tells me

13:18.965 --> 13:22.375
that there were a lot
of different types of beings

13:22.527 --> 13:26.287
that were interacting
with early Natives,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.640
much more than we even,
uh, think.

13:30.218 --> 13:32.960
TSOUKALOS: The kachinas
were their first teachers,

13:32.979 --> 13:36.873
the ones
that imparted the knowledge.

13:36.966 --> 13:40.151
The Hopi are very clear
in suggesting

13:40.378 --> 13:42.803
that the kachinas
were physical beings.

13:42.823 --> 13:46.716
MAHOOTY:
The kachina is a representation

13:46.734 --> 13:52.722
of the actual gods that used to
come into the villages eons ago.

13:52.740 --> 13:56.167
Some of them are warriors.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.728
Most of them
are priesthood-type kachinas,

13:58.746 --> 14:01.655
and they come
from different parts--

14:01.675 --> 14:04.567
In my opinion,
different parts of the universe.

14:04.586 --> 14:08.738
But they actually have
certain places on this planet

14:08.756 --> 14:10.590
that they call it home.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.833
Ours is west of here,

14:12.853 --> 14:14.760
and of course
a lot of other pueblos

14:14.913 --> 14:17.263
have their own specific place.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.191
And even to this day,
some of them are here.

14:22.178 --> 14:26.439
NARRATOR: The story of strange
humanoid beings assisting Native peoples

14:26.533 --> 14:30.368
has been recounted for centuries
among the Pueblo nations.

14:30.519 --> 14:34.688
Not only is it a central part
of their oral traditions,

14:34.708 --> 14:37.041
these encounters
were so significant

14:37.193 --> 14:40.378
they were carved in stone.

14:42.031 --> 14:45.866
DOVER: I believe that these
visitations have been documented

14:45.960 --> 14:49.629
in pictographs and petroglyphs.

14:49.781 --> 14:52.465
They're not art, actually,
for art's sake.

14:52.617 --> 14:55.785
The petroglyphs
have been done this way

14:55.878 --> 14:58.137
for basically thousands
of years.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.291
NARRATOR: Do petroglyphs
found throughout North America

15:02.310 --> 15:05.978
tell a story of ancient
extraterrestrial contact?

15:06.072 --> 15:09.966
In July 2021,

15:09.984 --> 15:12.577
ancient astronaut theorists
Giorgio Tsoukalos

15:12.728 --> 15:14.728
and William Henry traveled

15:14.748 --> 15:16.639
to Rock Art Ranch
in Winslow, Arizona,

15:16.658 --> 15:18.824
to investigate one
of North America's

15:18.919 --> 15:23.162
most extensive collections
of petroglyphs.

15:23.256 --> 15:27.833
Joining them is esteemed
Navajo Tribal Ranger Jon Dover.

15:27.986 --> 15:31.671
It's so great to meet you
because 31 years,

15:31.765 --> 15:34.674
you've been a Tribal Navajo
Ranger, is that correct?

15:34.826 --> 15:37.435
Yes, uh, I started in 1980,

15:37.662 --> 15:39.753
uh, to 2011.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.182
And, uh, worked,
uh, most of, uh,

15:43.334 --> 15:48.004
- the reservation up there, 27,000 square miles.
- Wow.

15:48.022 --> 15:49.839
This ranch is very unique

15:49.932 --> 15:54.452
because there is
so much archaeology here.

15:54.603 --> 15:57.530
Well, we're sure excited to be
here to get eyes on it with you.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.290
- Okay, well, let's go take a look.
- All right.

16:01.519 --> 16:05.538
NARRATOR: Rock Art Ranch's
5,000 acres are home to nearly

16:05.632 --> 16:09.116
3,000 ancient petroglyphs,
and on nearly every panel

16:09.210 --> 16:12.303
are figures that the Navajo
identify as star people.

16:12.455 --> 16:14.864
This is sensational.

16:14.957 --> 16:16.866
Look at that guy right there.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.885
- They call that the birthing mother, right?
- That's right.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.872
Very fascinating
because I'm looking at that

16:22.890 --> 16:25.374
and immediately
my mind goes around the world.

16:25.393 --> 16:26.985
Absolutely.

16:27.136 --> 16:29.712
- TSOUKALOS: This is a depiction of a mother goddess.
- Yep.

16:29.731 --> 16:32.381
TSOUKALOS: It's like
those big giant statues

16:32.400 --> 16:34.659
- that were found over in Europe...
- Right.

16:34.810 --> 16:38.145
but it also reminds me
of Dogu statues of Japan.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.314
- HENRY: Yeah.
- And also, the Wandjinas.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.834
- HENRY: Right.
- Very similar.

16:44.412 --> 16:47.321
NARRATOR: In the Northwest
Kimberly region of Australia,

16:47.340 --> 16:51.992
ancient cave art depicts
beings called the Wandjina,

16:52.012 --> 16:55.847
the sky heroes of one
of Australia's Indigenous clans.

16:56.074 --> 16:58.090
The stories behind
the Wandjinas goes

16:58.243 --> 16:59.684
that they descended from the sky

16:59.835 --> 17:02.428
and gave knowledge

17:02.580 --> 17:05.915
and jumpstarted civilization
in Australia

17:05.933 --> 17:07.841
thousands and thousands
of years ago.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.511
And the Wandjinas are incredible

17:10.530 --> 17:14.607
because they have
these gigantic heads

17:14.701 --> 17:17.276
and these long bodies

17:17.370 --> 17:19.445
and these arms.

17:19.597 --> 17:22.189
It seems as if they're inside

17:22.208 --> 17:26.210
some sort of a pressurized suit.

17:26.437 --> 17:30.773
There are similar figures
all around the world--

17:30.866 --> 17:33.943
Big bulbous heads, big bodies

17:33.961 --> 17:36.036
floating up in the sky.

17:36.130 --> 17:39.223
In Japan we have
the same things,

17:39.450 --> 17:41.392
in Africa...

17:41.619 --> 17:43.786
in Europe...

17:43.879 --> 17:47.732
in North and South America.

17:47.883 --> 17:51.977
So my suggestion is
that the extraterrestrials

17:52.072 --> 17:55.464
that came to Earth thousands
and thousands of years ago

17:55.558 --> 17:58.242
didn't just visit Australia.

17:58.394 --> 18:01.412
They visited each
and every continent on Earth.

18:01.639 --> 18:05.641
And that is why we have
the similar motifs.

18:05.660 --> 18:08.327
Look at the concentric rings
up there.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.571
That's the portal symbol.
There's two of them.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.090
And there's guys
around the portal,

18:12.317 --> 18:14.483
- on the lower one. Yeah.
- Interesting, yeah.

18:14.577 --> 18:17.929
Tell me, Jon,
petroglyphs are regarded

18:18.080 --> 18:21.674
as picture books
that tell a story all at once.

18:21.826 --> 18:25.010
That's right, and also en-en...

18:25.163 --> 18:28.606
- enmeshed in all this are religious symbols.
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.757 --> 18:31.851
Things that tell you something
about how they worshipped.

18:32.003 --> 18:34.278
- Pictures of gods.
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.430 --> 18:37.022
TSOUKALOS:
And when you say

18:37.175 --> 18:38.190
- "gods..."
- Gods, right.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.676
what, in your culture...

18:40.695 --> 18:44.347
- what does that mean?
- It could be anything from

18:44.365 --> 18:47.291
somebody coming to them

18:47.518 --> 18:50.369
and meeting with them
and imparting knowledge.

18:50.521 --> 18:52.630
And in the case of the Navajo,

18:52.857 --> 18:55.040
that's what
the Yeibichai represent.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.785
In the case of the Hopis, the
kachinas represent those gods...

18:58.805 --> 19:01.121
- HENRY: Right.
- that came to Earth

19:01.215 --> 19:03.457
to give them knowledge.

19:03.551 --> 19:06.644
And could one make the argument
that these may have been

19:06.795 --> 19:11.040
visitations by flesh-and-blood
extraterrestrials

19:11.133 --> 19:13.300
- in ancient times?
- Oh, definitely.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.136
From what we understand,
there's many different

19:16.156 --> 19:18.381
races of alien

19:18.474 --> 19:20.733
that are coming
to-to this world.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.977
- That's amazing.
- In the case of some tribes

19:23.997 --> 19:26.164
down in Southern Arizona,
you even have

19:26.315 --> 19:28.908
a mountain range called
the Estrella Mountains.

19:29.002 --> 19:33.487
In the language of the people
in that area, "Estrella"

19:33.506 --> 19:35.731
means "stargate."

19:35.750 --> 19:38.234
HENRY: Absolutely.
Estrella-- star people.

19:38.327 --> 19:41.662
Am I correct to assume that this
is only the tip of the iceberg,

19:41.681 --> 19:43.906
and that there are so many more

19:43.925 --> 19:47.593
panels like this that the world
doesn't even know about?

19:47.745 --> 19:49.854
On the Navajo reservation alone,

19:50.081 --> 19:54.433
there are 300,000 sites
that are recorded.

19:54.585 --> 19:58.345
I mean, we're talking
at least 4000 BC,

19:58.439 --> 20:00.198
- right?
- That's right.

20:00.349 --> 20:03.092
Well, this is great, but I'm
just looking on the other side,

20:03.110 --> 20:05.261
and there is more.
I mean, there's more everywhere.

20:05.279 --> 20:07.205
So let's go check out
the other ones,

20:07.356 --> 20:08.456
- as well.
- Sure thing.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.368
NARRATOR: Giorgio Tsoukalos
and William Henry

20:21.387 --> 20:23.279
have been granted special access

20:23.372 --> 20:26.282
to Rock Art Ranch
in Winslow, Arizona,

20:26.300 --> 20:29.876
where Navajo Tribal elder
Jon Dover is guiding them

20:29.896 --> 20:31.804
through the ancient
petroglyph panels.

20:31.956 --> 20:33.397
- Wow.
- Look at this.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.796
I mean, look at the hollow
body with the star inside.

20:40.815 --> 20:42.573
- HENRY: Mm-hmm.
- One hand pointing to the sky,

20:42.725 --> 20:43.574
the other down to Earth.

20:45.803 --> 20:48.228
And just beneath that,

20:48.248 --> 20:50.656
look at-- that is a Grey alien.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.324
TSOUKALOS: That
triangular head, very strange.

20:52.477 --> 20:53.809
HENRY:
That is a-- Yeah, it is.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.811
DOVER:
You have all kinds

20:55.904 --> 20:57.255
of different types of figures,

20:57.406 --> 21:00.149
- different representations of gods.
- Right.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.151
I mean, what we have to fill in
with our imagination

21:02.169 --> 21:05.671
is that these beings
off the wall, 3D,

21:05.765 --> 21:08.081
- walking amongst the people.
- (laughs) Yeah.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.250
- They're interacting with these beings.
- Right.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.827
We don't know
if it's the same time.

21:11.846 --> 21:14.346
- Right.
- Or could be different times.

21:14.499 --> 21:16.274
HENRY:
That's mind-blowing.

21:16.425 --> 21:19.259
I'm so intrigued by
that double helix up there, too,

21:19.279 --> 21:21.595
beside the trapezoidal figure.

21:21.689 --> 21:24.023
- I mean...
- TSOUKALOS: Mm-hmm, as if to indicate,

21:24.117 --> 21:27.451
because of the creature
on the left, DNA,

21:27.603 --> 21:29.194
- you know, had something to do with this.
- Right.

21:29.347 --> 21:31.789
- That's right.
- Giorgio, uh, when you see

21:31.940 --> 21:34.199
- the guy with the trapezoidal body...
- Mm-hmm.

21:34.352 --> 21:36.294
and you see
the curvy lines on the body,

21:36.521 --> 21:40.280
- that always symbolizes, like, vibration.
- Okay.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.633
The-the Anunnaki wore cloaks
that had those kind of

21:42.785 --> 21:44.451
- curvy lines all over.
- Right.

21:44.545 --> 21:47.196
And so here we have a clear,
clear symbolic connection

21:47.214 --> 21:49.456
with-with the Anunnaki
on this figure.

21:49.550 --> 21:53.794
The Anunnaki were powerful
deities worshipped more than

21:53.888 --> 21:57.815
5,000 years ago by the ancient
Sumerians who inhabited

21:57.966 --> 22:02.653
Mesopotamia, an area
that is now modern-day Iraq.

22:04.048 --> 22:06.991
According to the Sumerian
writings, the Anunnaki

22:07.142 --> 22:10.736
descended upon a mountain,
shining like the sun,

22:10.830 --> 22:14.815
and shared profound wisdom
with the human race.

22:14.909 --> 22:17.226
Look at all the different types

22:17.244 --> 22:20.487
of beings here, and then
all the way across there,

22:20.506 --> 22:22.506
y-you've still got
even more variety.

22:22.733 --> 22:25.918
I mean, this is almost
like a meeting place

22:26.012 --> 22:27.994
of all these different worlds
and different beings.

22:28.089 --> 22:31.998
So, you know, you have giants,
you have little people.

22:32.093 --> 22:35.911
And the giants and the little
people are talked about

22:35.930 --> 22:38.839
in the other world
that they came from

22:38.858 --> 22:40.916
before they came to this world.

22:40.935 --> 22:44.528
So, and this is the same
with Sego Canyon up in Utah.

22:46.107 --> 22:48.348
You have these massive,

22:48.368 --> 22:51.035
massive carvings
and petroglyphs.

22:52.705 --> 22:57.116
So the fact that we have these
virtually identical motifs,

22:57.210 --> 23:01.545
to me, suggests they were all
taught by the same teachers.

23:01.772 --> 23:04.030
And the guy here with the horns,

23:04.050 --> 23:07.276
which could be rays,
right next to the Grey alien.

23:07.294 --> 23:10.129
He's got horns or rays
coming off of his head.

23:10.281 --> 23:12.948
- We see that at Valcamonica in Italy.
- TSOUKALOS: Yes, you do.

23:12.967 --> 23:15.467
HENRY: You see it all kinds
of different places, but then

23:15.561 --> 23:17.620
pointing to the idea
these could be luminous

23:17.713 --> 23:19.397
or radiant beings
that they're portraying.

23:19.548 --> 23:21.640
TSOUKALOS:
And seeing creatures here

23:21.792 --> 23:24.568
- having, for example, three fingers...
- HENRY: Mm-hmm.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.572
You know, as far as I know, uh,
except for a couple of reptiles,

23:28.799 --> 23:31.075
there aren't
any three-fingered creatures.

23:31.226 --> 23:33.969
- Yeah.
- You know? So, and especially nothing humanoid.

23:34.062 --> 23:36.396
- Right.
- So, again, our ancestors

23:36.416 --> 23:39.642
had impeccable powers
of observation.

23:39.735 --> 23:41.234
That's all they did all day.

23:41.328 --> 23:42.920
They, they observed.

23:43.147 --> 23:45.089
And so your estimation then,
too,

23:45.316 --> 23:47.332
is that this was not
a bunch of kids,

23:47.427 --> 23:49.835
you know, on a Saturday night
not knowing what to do.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.595
Absolutely not.

23:51.747 --> 23:55.157
These were people that came
here with a purpose...

23:55.176 --> 23:58.084
- HENRY: Mm-hmm.
- and the purpose was to put

23:58.179 --> 24:01.421
their history on the wall

24:01.515 --> 24:05.184
showing where they came from,
where they were going.

24:05.336 --> 24:06.927
Jon, this is incredible,

24:06.946 --> 24:10.281
and what I love the most
is the access.

24:10.432 --> 24:13.008
I mean, I've never been
face-to-face like this.

24:13.027 --> 24:15.844
There's a lot of places
nobody's allowed to go

24:15.863 --> 24:18.697
except for archaeologists,
medicine men,

24:18.849 --> 24:21.625
-and Rangers.
-HENRY: It's spectacular. It's one thing to see

24:21.852 --> 24:23.777
images in a book
or on a... online,

24:23.871 --> 24:26.038
but to-to come face-to-face
with it, feel the energy,

24:26.190 --> 24:28.524
see it, spectacular.

24:28.617 --> 24:31.952
I came away with this deep sense

24:31.971 --> 24:35.698
that this is meant for us
to discover

24:35.716 --> 24:39.051
throughout the ages, that it was
super important to the ancients

24:39.203 --> 24:41.370
to record this information,

24:41.388 --> 24:43.205
to tell us
that these beings were here.

24:43.298 --> 24:46.058
They had a hand in our evolution

24:46.210 --> 24:48.894
and they're probably
still visiting us today.

24:49.046 --> 24:52.656
TSOUKALOS: What I think is
important in this whole thing is that

24:52.808 --> 24:56.476
Jon said these are our stories
of the star people.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.571
And when First Nation
cultures say

24:59.665 --> 25:03.984
that someone visited from
the sky and imparted knowledge,

25:04.003 --> 25:07.838
I think it's time
that we start to listen.

25:09.583 --> 25:12.492
NARRATOR: Do the petroglyphs
at Rock Art Ranch provide

25:12.512 --> 25:15.587
an historical record
of extraterrestrial visitation

25:15.681 --> 25:18.073
in North America?

25:18.092 --> 25:21.352
And if so, why does there
seem to be such a strong

25:21.503 --> 25:24.096
connection
between Native Americans

25:24.248 --> 25:26.006
and otherworldly beings?

25:26.100 --> 25:29.768
Perhaps further clues can
be found within oral traditions

25:29.920 --> 25:32.863
that describe strange beings
known as...

25:33.090 --> 25:34.949
the ant men.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.859
NARRATOR: In the desolate high
desert of the American Southwest

25:45.953 --> 25:48.862
stand the ruins of the most
important ceremonial site

25:48.881 --> 25:51.364
of the ancient Pueblo people.

25:51.458 --> 25:54.885
Constructed around 900 AD,

25:55.112 --> 25:57.537
the central feature
of this vast complex

25:57.557 --> 25:59.372
is the Great Kiva.

25:59.466 --> 26:02.467
A kiva is basically,

26:02.620 --> 26:06.305
um, a Native American version
of a church.

26:06.457 --> 26:09.141
It is a circular structure.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.794
Chaco Canyon has

26:11.812 --> 26:15.722
an absolutely giant one
that's located there.

26:15.741 --> 26:20.411
When you enter one you're
literally entering another world

26:20.638 --> 26:23.247
to commune
with the gods from before.

26:24.733 --> 26:27.159
In ancient Pueblo culture,

26:27.253 --> 26:31.663
every place you went had
a small kiva of some kind.

26:31.816 --> 26:34.091
But they would get together

26:34.318 --> 26:36.093
maybe eight or nine
different kivas,

26:36.320 --> 26:39.412
small ones,
into a larger great kiva,

26:39.432 --> 26:43.934
and the great kivas were huge.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.997
When the Spanish came in
in the 1600s,

26:49.016 --> 26:51.424
they took their church
and interposed it

26:51.518 --> 26:53.093
on top of the kiva.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.279
So everywhere
in these Hopi villages,

26:55.430 --> 26:59.783
in the Pueblo villages
that you see a Catholic church,

27:00.010 --> 27:03.103
it's usually
on the high point of land

27:03.122 --> 27:05.681
where the kiva was destroyed
and the church

27:05.774 --> 27:08.083
was built over the top of it.

27:09.870 --> 27:13.297
NARRATOR: Every kiva
includes a feature called a sipapu.

27:13.524 --> 27:17.693
In some kivas,
the sipapu is a small hole

27:17.711 --> 27:19.695
in the subterranean wall.

27:19.713 --> 27:21.713
In kivas that are enclosed,

27:21.807 --> 27:25.125
it is often represented
by a hole in the roof.

27:25.144 --> 27:29.554
In both cases, it is the most
important part of the structure,

27:29.707 --> 27:33.725
symbolizing the entrance
to a subterranean world.

27:33.878 --> 27:37.655
All of the Pueblos share a story

27:37.882 --> 27:41.307
in which humankind
began under the earth.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.903
And we slowly,
over generations, crawled up

27:45.055 --> 27:47.647
and out of a hole called sipapu.

27:47.667 --> 27:53.153
And the kivas have this little
hole in it symbolizing that.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.322
NARRATOR: The descendants
of the Ancestral Pueblo

27:56.342 --> 27:59.067
share the belief
that Earth was populated

27:59.086 --> 28:02.921
three separate times
before the era of modern humans,

28:03.015 --> 28:05.683
with each previous age

28:05.834 --> 28:08.352
ending
in a devastating cataclysm.

28:08.503 --> 28:10.913
HENRY: The Pueblo Indians
believe that

28:10.931 --> 28:13.916
there in fact were three worlds,
or epochs, before ours.

28:14.009 --> 28:15.842
And they were all destroyed.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.679
The first by fire,
the second by ice,

28:19.773 --> 28:22.274
and the third by water.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.703
In each instance,
they tell us that it was due

28:25.854 --> 28:28.688
to mistreatment of the Earth,
and so that tells us

28:28.782 --> 28:33.118
that there could have been
previous examples of humanity

28:33.270 --> 28:35.879
that were destroyed
who knows how long ago.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.459
CHILDRESS: We're living
now in the fourth world.

28:40.611 --> 28:43.128
And the Zunis and Hopis believe

28:43.222 --> 28:46.890
our fourth world will also end
in a cataclysm.

28:48.469 --> 28:51.729
HENRY: Their prophecy
says that there would be a,

28:51.880 --> 28:54.398
a gourd of ashes
that would come from the sky.

28:54.549 --> 28:57.142
That's interpreted
as nuclear warfare.

28:57.294 --> 29:01.146
TSOUKALOS: The Hopi suggest
that there were previous worlds

29:01.240 --> 29:05.409
or civilizations before,
and this is interesting because

29:05.636 --> 29:07.745
there are other cultures,
ancient cultures,

29:07.972 --> 29:10.873
around the world,
who speak of similar stories.

29:12.493 --> 29:14.159
HENRY: The Kabbalah
teaches that there were previous

29:14.311 --> 29:15.902
advanced human civilizations.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.904
A number of them.

29:17.998 --> 29:20.983
The Hindus teach
about the Yugas,

29:21.001 --> 29:23.168
where civilization advances

29:23.320 --> 29:27.914
to a very high place and then
descends and then re-ascends.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.509
It, too, is divided
into four different ages.

29:30.603 --> 29:34.663
So all of these traditions
corresponds directly

29:34.681 --> 29:38.183
with what the Native American
tradition is teaching.

29:38.335 --> 29:41.111
NARRATOR: Could the
Native American tradition

29:41.338 --> 29:45.282
describing previous ages
of humankind be true?

29:45.509 --> 29:48.844
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

29:48.937 --> 29:51.271
and suggest that these stories

29:51.290 --> 29:54.958
also contain evidence of
extraterrestrial intervention.

29:56.778 --> 30:01.465
The Hopis of Northern Arizona
have a very curious myth

30:01.692 --> 30:05.469
of surviving
the third of the cataclysms

30:05.620 --> 30:10.215
by going underground and living
with what they call the ant men.

30:10.367 --> 30:14.961
HENRY: The stories the Hopi tell
us that the ant people rescued them

30:15.055 --> 30:19.057
from cataclysm by taking them
underground, literally,

30:19.151 --> 30:21.985
and helping the Hopi
to survive underground,

30:22.137 --> 30:25.322
and then once it was safe
to return to the surface

30:25.473 --> 30:28.717
of the Earth, the Hopi were
taken up through the sipapu

30:28.735 --> 30:32.663
by the ant people
and repopulated the Earth.

30:32.814 --> 30:35.223
But in all instances,
the ant people are described

30:35.242 --> 30:37.668
as having a special
relationship with the Hopi,

30:37.819 --> 30:41.229
and also of having a connection
with the star realms.

30:41.323 --> 30:45.734
NARRATOR: Despite their name,
ant men are described not as insects

30:45.752 --> 30:49.162
but rather
as small humanoid figures.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.182
The reason they call
these creatures "ant men"

30:52.409 --> 30:55.018
is that they lived
under the earth,

30:55.170 --> 30:58.413
and they would emerge much like
ants crawling out of a hive.

30:58.432 --> 31:01.433
So they called them ant men,
but what they were,

31:01.585 --> 31:03.418
were extraterrestrials.

31:03.437 --> 31:06.605
They were entering
our world through the portal.

31:06.757 --> 31:10.942
CHILDRESS: The ant men
were underground dwellers who

31:11.036 --> 31:13.778
had a high technology
and looked very similar

31:13.873 --> 31:16.707
apparently to what
we would call Grey aliens.

31:16.858 --> 31:19.935
So this is something
of a mystery,

31:20.028 --> 31:22.604
of-of who these ant men were.

31:22.623 --> 31:26.717
Many Hopis and the Zunis
have similar belief that,

31:26.944 --> 31:28.886
yes, the ant men
were extraterrestrials.

31:31.039 --> 31:32.872
MAHOOTY:
There were beings that are

31:32.966 --> 31:35.208
of extraterrestrial origin

31:35.227 --> 31:38.878
that were...
were part of that whole

31:38.972 --> 31:41.139
emergence mythology.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.358
The entrance
to the fourth world.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.237
Could it be
that the story of the ant men

31:47.389 --> 31:49.297
is a genuine account

31:49.316 --> 31:52.058
of extraterrestrials
helping humanity survive

31:52.152 --> 31:54.578
a global cataclysm?

31:54.805 --> 31:57.748
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

31:57.899 --> 32:00.659
and suggest further clues
can be found

32:00.811 --> 32:02.902
by comparing
the Native American traditions

32:02.922 --> 32:05.756
to accounts
of a legendary lost continent

32:05.907 --> 32:08.759
called Atlantis.

32:16.936 --> 32:20.829
NARRATOR: In his famous
dialogues, <i>Timaeus</i> and<i> Critias,</i>

32:20.922 --> 32:22.922
the Greek philosopher
Plato writes

32:22.942 --> 32:25.091
about a lost continent

32:25.185 --> 32:28.336
that existed 9,000 years
before his time

32:28.355 --> 32:32.616
and was home to
a highly advanced civilization.

32:32.767 --> 32:36.954
Called Atlantis, it was founded
by the Greek god Poseidon,

32:37.181 --> 32:41.349
and the inhabitants possessed
sophisticated technology.

32:41.443 --> 32:45.036
But Atlantis was ultimately
destroyed

32:45.130 --> 32:49.449
by a terrible cataclysm, and
according to some researchers,

32:49.468 --> 32:52.877
the story of its destruction
is strikingly similar

32:53.030 --> 32:55.714
to Native American traditions
detailing the end

32:55.866 --> 32:58.366
of the third world.

32:58.385 --> 33:01.294
HENRY: The Hopi and other
Pueblo Indians tell us

33:01.313 --> 33:03.722
that their devastating cataclysm

33:03.874 --> 33:06.875
was due to human greed
and wandering away

33:06.968 --> 33:09.544
from the-the spiritual truths
of our creator.

33:09.637 --> 33:13.231
What's interesting
about this is that this idea

33:13.325 --> 33:16.401
is echoed in Plato's story
of the destruction of Atlantis.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.812
The Atlanteans were
also created by gods.

33:19.832 --> 33:23.166
As soon as humanity
wandered off into materialism,

33:23.393 --> 33:27.395
that's when Atlantis was
destroyed by water.

33:27.489 --> 33:30.248
A perfect correspondence
with what the Hopi said

33:30.400 --> 33:32.175
happened at the end
of the third world.

33:32.327 --> 33:34.494
NARRATOR:
Could there be a connection

33:34.513 --> 33:37.163
between the ancient Greek tale
of Atlantis

33:37.257 --> 33:39.999
and Native American
origin stories?

33:40.093 --> 33:42.853
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

33:43.080 --> 33:46.339
another story told
by early Native Americans

33:46.358 --> 33:49.509
bears striking similarities
to Atlantis--

33:49.603 --> 33:54.013
The legend of the lost city
of Aztlán, which appears

33:54.107 --> 33:56.033
in the traditions of the Aztecs

33:56.260 --> 33:57.850
and numerous
Native American groups

33:57.944 --> 33:59.703
throughout the Southwest.

34:13.944 --> 34:17.846
of the Hopis, so we have
all these oral histories also...

34:24.137 --> 34:27.046
There's debate among scholars
as to exactly

34:27.066 --> 34:29.382
what Aztlán looked like.

34:29.401 --> 34:33.737
And we know that the Aztecs say

34:33.964 --> 34:37.056
that their capital
of Tenochtitlán

34:37.076 --> 34:40.985
was made in the image of Aztlán.

34:41.138 --> 34:43.729
And from that capital,

34:43.824 --> 34:47.158
we get a backwards projection
that their origin place

34:47.311 --> 34:51.171
is an island
surrounded by water.

34:52.833 --> 34:55.908
They actually built
Tenochtitlán up

34:56.002 --> 34:58.578
into the lake
and put causeways out

34:58.672 --> 35:01.823
so that it looks
very much like Atlantis.

35:01.916 --> 35:04.826
NARRATOR:
According to the Aztecs,

35:04.845 --> 35:08.921
the god Huitzilopochtli
was the founder of Tenochtitlán,

35:08.941 --> 35:11.850
which as far
as ancient astronaut theorists

35:12.002 --> 35:14.778
are concerned, provides yet
another intriguing connection

35:14.929 --> 35:18.690
to Plato's
description of Atlantis.

35:18.842 --> 35:22.435
Tenochtitlán was
a place made artificially.

35:22.529 --> 35:25.956
Compare it to Atlantis.

35:26.183 --> 35:29.442
In both cases,
a god was the ruler of it.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.129
In Atlantis, we have Poseidon.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.965
Now, Poseidon was
an extraterrestrial.

35:35.192 --> 35:39.544
Not everyone should
have access to Atlantis.

35:39.696 --> 35:43.381
The same thing
in Aztlán or Tenochtitlán.

35:43.533 --> 35:45.475
They wanted to be separated.

35:45.627 --> 35:48.311
They had a certain technology
there which was

35:48.538 --> 35:52.131
a hidden technology, and it was
not for the general public.

35:52.225 --> 35:53.817
See, it's the same thing.

35:54.044 --> 35:56.135
TSOUKALOS:
The fact that we have stories

35:56.229 --> 35:58.471
that are not just similar
but identical

35:58.490 --> 36:01.974
leads me to think that perhaps

36:01.994 --> 36:03.976
these ancient cultures
were visited

36:03.996 --> 36:06.888
by the same extraterrestrials.

36:06.907 --> 36:10.074
NARRATOR:
While mainstream academics

36:10.227 --> 36:13.653
consider the stories
of these lost civilizations

36:13.672 --> 36:16.748
and their destruction
to be mythological,

36:16.900 --> 36:19.751
the recent discovery
of vast sunken landmasses

36:19.903 --> 36:21.920
such as Doggerland,

36:22.072 --> 36:26.424
located just east
of the British Isles in 2012,

36:26.518 --> 36:31.079
and Zealandia,
found near New Zealand in 2017,

36:31.097 --> 36:34.749
may offer proof
that a catastrophic water event

36:34.768 --> 36:38.195
did, in fact,
change the face of the Earth.

36:38.422 --> 36:41.531
CHILDRESS: So here
we have authentic legends

36:41.683 --> 36:45.927
of lost lands that were
destroyed in cataclysms.

36:45.946 --> 36:49.539
Mainstream historians,
you know, still

36:49.691 --> 36:52.283
pretty much reject this,
feel that it's all myths.

36:52.436 --> 36:55.453
But it would seem
really that all kinds

36:55.605 --> 36:58.940
of civilizations could have
come and gone on our planet.

36:58.959 --> 37:01.443
We know that there are over 200

37:01.461 --> 37:04.370
known submerged cities
in the Mediterranean.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.872
There's just so much
on our planet

37:06.892 --> 37:08.808
that we have yet to find out.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.637
YOUNG: In the Native
American Indigenous teaching,

37:12.731 --> 37:15.123
there are cycles
of destruction and rebirth.

37:15.141 --> 37:17.792
The interesting part is that
this is parallel

37:17.811 --> 37:19.552
to other great world teachings.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.239
In the story of Noah,

37:22.466 --> 37:24.407
the sons of God came down
to Earth.

37:24.634 --> 37:26.892
And they were teaching
the humans evil ways,

37:26.987 --> 37:29.729
and God decided to intervene

37:29.748 --> 37:32.474
and brought this great flood.

37:32.567 --> 37:35.977
In the story of Gilgamesh,
the Sumerian legend,

37:36.070 --> 37:39.481
the council of gods
brought the flood.

37:39.574 --> 37:43.927
The Inca god Viracocha created
the great flood.

37:44.154 --> 37:46.763
HENRY:
So all of these traditions

37:46.914 --> 37:50.174
correspond directly with
the Hopi four worlds tradition

37:50.327 --> 37:52.677
about previous civilizations

37:52.771 --> 37:55.013
destroyed by the gods.

37:55.107 --> 37:56.831
The story is always the same.

37:56.850 --> 37:58.441
This speaks to the idea

37:58.593 --> 38:01.278
of extraterrestrial intervention
in human affairs.

38:01.429 --> 38:04.447
ROBLES: I believe there
are ancient civilizations

38:04.599 --> 38:08.860
that some people
refuse to write about.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.863
But ancient civilizations are

38:12.015 --> 38:14.791
coming to surface
because the time has come

38:14.942 --> 38:19.129
to tell the truth
about human origin.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.114
NARRATOR: Could it be
that Native American stories

38:22.208 --> 38:25.302
of star people
and of lost civilizations

38:25.529 --> 38:28.454
so closely resembles
other ancient traditions

38:28.473 --> 38:31.123
from around the globe
because they all encountered

38:31.217 --> 38:34.311
the same otherworldly visitors?

38:34.538 --> 38:37.722
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and suggest

38:37.816 --> 38:41.300
the Native Americans'
knowledge of star people

38:41.394 --> 38:43.711
comes not only
from the distant past

38:43.805 --> 38:46.639
but from
the extraterrestrial activity

38:46.733 --> 38:50.243
that occurs over
Native lands even today.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.822
NARRATOR: According to
Zuni elder Clifford Mahooty,

39:02.841 --> 39:06.158
above this steep mesa
on the Zuni Reservation,

39:06.252 --> 39:09.846
strange lights are seen
in the sky nearly every night.

39:10.073 --> 39:14.425
The UFO activity here
is very, very,

39:14.578 --> 39:16.928
uh, prevalent because

39:17.080 --> 39:19.247
of the religious system

39:19.340 --> 39:22.083
that we practice every day.

39:22.102 --> 39:25.937
So all around
the whole Zuni reservation

39:26.031 --> 39:29.699
you can look up
in the sky and they're up there.

39:29.926 --> 39:33.761
And they're not stars.
They're not planets.

39:33.855 --> 39:35.763
There's a lot of our people

39:35.782 --> 39:37.540
that, here in Zuni,
have seen them.

39:39.119 --> 39:41.211
TSOUKALOS: When you talk
to many Native Americans,

39:41.362 --> 39:43.955
they'll tell you
that UFO sightings are common

39:44.049 --> 39:45.548
on their Native lands.

39:45.775 --> 39:48.051
And you have to ask,
why is that?

39:48.278 --> 39:50.461
Is it because they have had
these traditions

39:50.555 --> 39:53.965
of the star people
and the star ancestors?

39:54.059 --> 39:57.802
Maybe places like the Zuni
territory and Hopi mesas

39:57.896 --> 40:00.563
have been visited
for thousands of years.

40:02.216 --> 40:04.901
NARRATOR:
Today, more UFO incidents

40:05.052 --> 40:09.054
are being reported and captured
on camera than ever before.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.408
But while this recent activity

40:11.635 --> 40:13.468
has captured
the public's imagination

40:13.561 --> 40:16.988
and inspired
sensational headlines,

40:17.140 --> 40:21.476
for many Native Americans, it
is nothing out of the ordinary.

40:21.494 --> 40:26.147
In my time working
as a Navajo Ranger,

40:26.240 --> 40:29.834
we had incidences of, uh, UFOs

40:29.986 --> 40:31.911
coming and going all the time.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.989
When we talk to people,
they tell us,

40:35.082 --> 40:36.749
"Oh, yeah,
they're here all the time."

40:36.843 --> 40:39.084
So they just accept it.

40:39.179 --> 40:41.420
And as such, with the knowledge

40:41.440 --> 40:45.183
that I have
and the experiences I've had,

40:45.335 --> 40:47.092
I know they're out there--
I've seen them

40:47.187 --> 40:48.836
numerous, numerous times.

40:48.930 --> 40:52.097
And, uh, it's
just a fact of life.

40:52.192 --> 40:54.951
ROBLES:
We must reestablish

40:55.178 --> 40:58.179
the connection
between our star ancestors

40:58.198 --> 41:01.440
by educating and creating
an awareness among the,

41:01.534 --> 41:03.201
the humans on Earth.

41:03.353 --> 41:05.520
We have to establish

41:05.538 --> 41:08.131
an urgency
protecting the sacred sites

41:08.358 --> 41:10.300
and telling the story
of what they mean.

41:10.527 --> 41:12.117
This is the history
of the world.

41:12.212 --> 41:13.887
We are star beings.

41:15.456 --> 41:17.974
MAHOOTY: As far as being
connected with the star elders,

41:18.201 --> 41:20.643
they gave us
this knowledge, and ours

41:20.795 --> 41:24.296
is a direct relationship
with the...

41:24.316 --> 41:26.983
entities
throughout the universe.

41:28.561 --> 41:31.379
NARRATOR:
Could contact with star people

41:31.397 --> 41:34.657
as described
in the ancient sacred traditions

41:34.809 --> 41:38.328
still be happening in Native
American communities today?

41:38.479 --> 41:41.072
And if so,
might it be the beginning

41:41.224 --> 41:43.558
of the next Earth cycle?

41:43.576 --> 41:47.912
And a profound new chapter
in the human story?

41:48.064 --> 41:50.915
Perhaps as we learn the truth

41:51.067 --> 41:53.084
about the mysterious objects
in the sky,

41:53.236 --> 41:56.087
we will discover
that the star ancestors

41:56.181 --> 41:59.331
are not merely ancient
figures carved on rocks

41:59.351 --> 42:02.185
but an extraterrestrial presence

42:02.412 --> 42:04.687
that has
been guiding us all along.
