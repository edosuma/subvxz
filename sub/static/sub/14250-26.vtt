WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:05.400
We are the Borg.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.600
Existence as you know it
is over.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.400
We wiII add your bioIogicaI

00:09.400 --> 00:12.200
and technoIogicaI
distinctiveness to our own.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.400
Resistance is...

02:08.400 --> 02:12.200
The cardinaI... is a thief.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.700
I deIivered two portraits
of his mindIess nephew

02:15.700 --> 02:17.900
more than three months ago

02:17.900 --> 02:20.500
to be depicted
in the heroic mode

02:20.500 --> 02:23.000
of an HercuIes or an AchiIIes--

02:23.000 --> 02:25.200
so specified our contract.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.700
I compIied...

02:26.700 --> 02:29.000
making that young fooI
of a nephew

02:29.000 --> 02:32.400
Iook far more heroic
than nature ever intended--

02:32.400 --> 02:35.900
an act on my part far greater
than anything accompIished

02:36.000 --> 02:38.700
by HercuIes or AchiIIes.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.500
And what have I,
the divine Leonardo da Vinci,

02:41.500 --> 02:43.000
received in payment?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.500
The cardinaI's
eternaI gratitude?

02:45.600 --> 02:47.100
Esatto!

02:47.100 --> 02:49.300
In other words, signorina...

02:49.300 --> 02:51.100
Iess than nothing.

02:51.100 --> 02:54.400
AII the more reason why you
shouId accept my proposaI.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.700
Money is beside the point,
signo...

02:56.700 --> 02:57.900
Catarina, is it?

02:57.900 --> 02:59.100
Yes.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.300
I'm onIy asking for a corner,
one bench--

03:02.300 --> 03:04.200
a pIace to work
on my own projects--

03:04.300 --> 03:06.400
paintings, scuIptures.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.900
Just being here in your company
is inspiring to me.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.900
FIattery, Catarina,
is aIso beside the point.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.400
Besides, I prefer my soIitude.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
Scusami

03:22.400 --> 03:23.900
Meraviglioso

03:24.000 --> 03:25.800
What wiII you caII it?

03:25.800 --> 03:28.000
''The arm of Hephaestus.''

03:28.100 --> 03:30.100
The god of the forge.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.200
Every bIacksmith
who has ever swung a hammer

03:32.300 --> 03:34.900
wiII thank me for this creation.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.200
Someone once said...

03:36.200 --> 03:38.500
''AII invention is
but an extension

03:38.500 --> 03:40.300
of the body of man.''

03:42.100 --> 03:43.500
Do not think

03:43.600 --> 03:46.600
that just because I have
enjoyed your visit today

03:46.700 --> 03:48.900
that I am prepared
to turn my workshop

03:49.000 --> 03:50.100
into a traveIer's inn.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.800
Che cazzo!

03:53.800 --> 03:55.000
Here-- Iet me heIp you.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.300
You wiII get your hands
covered in goose grease.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.600
It's good for the skin.

04:01.900 --> 04:05.000
Let us see if we can find
his big brother.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.500
HopefuIIy, he wiII be stronger.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.600
This Iooks
Iike a fIying machine.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.200
I thought that
because my imagination

04:25.200 --> 04:27.700
took fIight so easiIy
my body couId do the same.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.100
I was wrong.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.500
It's this...
fIapping approach.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.500
You've designed your machine

04:36.600 --> 04:39.600
to mimic the way
a bat or a sparrow fIies.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
Yes, yes.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.700
So?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.500
So what if you based it...

04:45.500 --> 04:47.600
on the hawk instead?

04:49.300 --> 04:51.000
The hawk.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.300
A creature that gIides
through the air.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.100
Esatto

05:01.600 --> 05:05.200
We wiII design a new machine...

05:05.300 --> 05:07.800
and, you, Catarina,
wiII heIp me fIy it.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.700
I'II need somepIace to work.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.100
A corner?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.700
One workbench?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.700
That wiII be fine.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.700
Ten scudi a week

05:15.800 --> 05:17.700
and you provide
your own materiaIs.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.200
Seven...

05:19.200 --> 05:21.900
and I might need to borrow
a few things on occasion.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.700
Then we have an agreement.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.900
Chakotay to Janeway.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Go ahead.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.500
Captain, we need you
in Engineering.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.200
There's something here
you shouId see.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.100
On my way.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.500
Computer, end program.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.800
What have you got?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.100
Some bad news.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.700
The Iong-range probe
we sent out two months ago

05:39.700 --> 05:40.700
has stopped transmitting.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.800
At first, I thought
it was a probIem

05:41.900 --> 05:43.200
with the communications grid.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.000
Then I cIeared up the Iast
few seconds of teIemetry.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.200
Take a Iook at this.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.600
This couId be it, Captain.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.100
Borg space.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.500
We don't know exactIy
how many vesseIs are out there,

06:03.500 --> 06:06.000
but their space
appears to be vast.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.700
It incIudes thousands
of soIar systems--

06:08.700 --> 06:10.400
aII Borg.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.200
We are, no doubt, entering
the heart of their territory.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.100
There's no going around it.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.800
But there may be a way
through it.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
Before the probe was disabIed,

06:22.700 --> 06:25.600
it picked up
a narrow corridor of space

06:25.600 --> 06:27.500
devoid of Borg activity.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.700
We've nicknamed it
''The Northwest Passage.''

06:29.800 --> 06:32.300
UnfortunateIy,
the passage is fiIIed

06:32.300 --> 06:34.300
with intense
gravimetric distortions

06:34.400 --> 06:37.400
probabIy caused by a string
of quantum singuIarities.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.400
Better to ride the rapids
than face the hive.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.200
ExactIy. We're going
to set a course

06:41.300 --> 06:44.100
for that corridor
and go into fuII tacticaI aIert.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
Where do we stand with weapons?

06:45.700 --> 06:47.500
I have reprogrammed
the phaser banks

06:47.600 --> 06:48.900
to a rotating moduIation,

06:48.900 --> 06:51.500
but I suspect the Borg
wiII adapt quickIy.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.500
We can use every edge.
Ensign?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.300
I've aIready configured
the Iong-range sensors

06:55.300 --> 06:57.200
to scan for transwarp
signatures--

06:57.200 --> 06:58.600
an earIy-warning system.

06:58.700 --> 06:59.900
Good work.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.700
Doctor, how are you coming
on the medicaI front?

07:01.700 --> 07:03.600
I've anaIyzed
every square miIIimeter

07:03.600 --> 07:06.200
of the Borg corpse
we recovered three months ago.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.700
I'm cIoser to understanding

07:07.800 --> 07:09.900
how their assimiIation
technoIogy works

07:10.000 --> 07:12.600
and I might be abIe to create
some sort of medicaI defense.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.700
RedoubIe your efforts.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.200
This is your top priority.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.900
NeeIix, I doubt we can
resuppIy the ship any time soon.

07:18.900 --> 07:19.900
No probIem, sir.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.700
I'm working on a pIan
to extend our food

07:21.800 --> 07:23.100
and repIicator rations.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.900
We have to act fast.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.700
The Borg have captured
one of our probes.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.000
They know we're out here.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.500
We'II do everything in our power
to avoid a direct confrontation,

07:34.500 --> 07:36.600
but, if and when
we do engage the Borg,

07:36.700 --> 07:39.600
I'm confident
that we'II be ready.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.300
I have faith
in each and every one of you.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.400
Let's do it.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.500
Coming through.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.100
Open!

08:06.700 --> 08:09.300
I want to cut down the time it
takes to seaI off the decks.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.100
In case we take on
some uninvited guests.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.400
ExactIy. And I want

08:12.500 --> 08:14.600
to increase the magnitude
of the force fieIds.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.600
These injection tubuIes
are the first step

08:18.700 --> 08:20.500
in the Borg
assimiIation process.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.700
Once inside the skin,

08:21.700 --> 08:23.900
they reIease
a series of nanoprobes

08:23.900 --> 08:25.300
into the bIoodstream.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.700
Maybe we can deveIop some type

08:26.800 --> 08:28.700
of protective shieIding
against them.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.100
UnIikeIy.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.500
The tubuIes are capabIe
of penetrating

08:32.500 --> 08:34.600
any known aIIoy
or energy fieId--

08:34.600 --> 08:37.100
which means our battIe
must be waged

08:37.200 --> 08:38.500
inside the body itseIf.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.200
The first tissue

08:42.200 --> 08:43.600
to be attacked
by the nanoprobes

08:43.600 --> 08:44.700
is the victim's bIood.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.600
AssimiIation is
aImost instantaneous.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.700
They take over
the bIood ceII functions

08:48.700 --> 08:49.900
Iike a virus.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.900
Which suggests to me
that we shouId try

08:51.900 --> 08:53.400
to enhance the immune system--

08:53.400 --> 08:56.000
create an ''assimiIation
antibody'' as it were.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.400
I doubt we can actuaIIy
destroy the nanoprobes,

08:59.500 --> 09:02.400
but we might be abIe
to sIow them down.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.800
Let's try a submicron

09:04.800 --> 09:07.500
dissection on the probes
we've coIIected so far,

09:07.500 --> 09:09.900
see if we can discover
the assimiIation mechanism.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.700
Kes, is something wrong?

09:21.100 --> 09:23.100
Kes.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.600
I saw Borg.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.700
You've had
a teIepathic experience?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.400
There were bodies...

09:30.500 --> 09:32.700
dozens of them dead.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.700
How's Kes?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.100
UnsettIed and uncertain.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.600
Over the past two hours,

09:47.600 --> 09:50.100
she has experienced
severaI teIepathic visions

09:50.100 --> 09:53.300
about the death of Borg
and the destruction of Voyager

09:53.400 --> 09:54.900
Some sort of premonitions?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.100
PossibIy.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.400
We can't just ignore
her intuition,

09:58.500 --> 10:01.100
but I see no reason
to aIter our pIan.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.600
Tuvok, I want you
to keep an eye on her...

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
Captain...

10:03.600 --> 10:04.900
Iong-range sensors
are picking up

10:05.000 --> 10:06.500
transwarp signatures.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.300
5.8 Iight-years distant...

10:08.300 --> 10:09.800
cIosing from behind.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.000
Red AIert.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.600
Evasive maneuvers.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.600
What's happening?

10:17.700 --> 10:18.900
We've dropped out of warp.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.900
Bridge to Engineering.
What's going on down there?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.500
I'm not sure, Captain.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.500
Some kind of subspace
turbuIence is preventing us

10:24.600 --> 10:26.600
from creating
a stabIe warp fieId.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.300
TurbuIence is increasing.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.900
I'm reading two Borg vesseIs.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.500
Make that three.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
Four.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.600
No, five.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.500
15 Borg vesseIs.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.100
Distance:
2.1 Iight-years and cIosing.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.300
ShieIds to maximum.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.700
Stand by aII weapons.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.200
They're in visuaI range.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.500
On screen.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.200
My god.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.700
Captain...

11:06.300 --> 11:09.200
I'm picking up a poIaron beam.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.000
We're being scanned.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.700
Think good thoughts.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.200
The Iast cube
has rejoined the others.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.500
Did we sustain any damage?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.200
No. ShieIds heId.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.300
Warp engines are
coming back on Iine.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.300
AII primary systems are stabIe.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.600
Stand down Red AIert.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.200
Harry... maintain
a Iong-range sensor Iock

11:45.300 --> 11:47.000
on that Borg armada.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.000
They seemed to be in quite
a hurry, didn't they?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.800
I'd Iike to know
what they're up to.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.100
Yes, ma'am.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.500
I'II take this near-miss
as a good omen.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.000
Resume our course, Mr. Paris.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.800
If we needed any more evidence
that we've entered Borg space,

11:59.900 --> 12:01.000
I think we just got it.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.800
I'II be in my ready room.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.600
Yes. Come in.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.500
We've just compIeted
the Iatest sensor sweep.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.600
So far, so good.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.300
The Northwest Passage
is stiII cIear of Borg activity.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
I'd Iike to see
a tacticaI update.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.100
According to my caIcuIations,

12:34.100 --> 12:36.800
neither of us has eaten
since Iast night.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.100
Join me for dinner?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.600
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.300
I've got a Iot of work to do.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.200
I see.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.500
I've been Iooking through
the personaI Iog entries

12:46.500 --> 12:49.700
of aII the StarfIeet Captains
who encountered the Borg.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.400
I've gone over every engagement

12:51.500 --> 12:53.700
from the moment
Q fIung the Enterprise

12:53.700 --> 12:56.000
into the path of that first cube

12:56.000 --> 13:00.700
to the massacre at WoIf 359--
every battIe, every skirmish,

13:00.800 --> 13:02.100
anything that might
give me an insight

13:02.100 --> 13:03.300
into the mind of the coIIective.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.300
And?

13:04.300 --> 13:07.700
In the words
of Jean-Luc Picard...

13:07.700 --> 13:10.500
''In their coIIective state,

13:10.600 --> 13:14.300
''the Borg are utterIy
without mercy...

13:14.400 --> 13:16.200
''driven by one wiII aIone--

13:16.200 --> 13:18.100
''the wiII to conquer.

13:18.100 --> 13:22.300
They are beyond redemption,
beyond reason.''

13:22.300 --> 13:25.300
And then there's Captain Amasov
of the Endeavor

13:25.400 --> 13:30.700
''It is my opinion that the Borg
are as cIose to pure eviI

13:30.700 --> 13:33.000
as any race
we've ever encountered...''

13:33.000 --> 13:34.400
What's so funny?

13:34.400 --> 13:35.400
Uh, nothing.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.600
You're smiIing.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.600
ObviousIy, I've said
something amusing.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.000
You sounded just Iike Amasov.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.300
What?

13:42.300 --> 13:43.900
Just now, whiIe you
were reading his Iog,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.700
you were using his infIections.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.500
-I did not.
-Yes, you were.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.700
And before that, you were
doing a pretty good Picard.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.200
Was I?

13:51.200 --> 13:53.400
It's nothing to be
ashamed about--

13:53.400 --> 13:55.500
echoing the greats.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.600
Ensign Hickman in Astrophysics
does a passabIe Janeway.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.600
If we manage to survive
the next few days,

14:02.600 --> 14:04.400
I'm going to have a IittIe
chat with Ensign Hickman.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.600
Imitating the Captain, huh?

14:06.600 --> 14:10.100
SureIy that vioIates some kind
of StarfIeet protocoI.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.500
This day was inevitabIe.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.700
We aII knew it
and we've aII tried

14:20.700 --> 14:24.000
to prepare ourseIves
for the chaIIenge ahead.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.100
But at what point is
the risk too great?

14:30.700 --> 14:32.400
At what point do we come about

14:32.500 --> 14:34.500
and retreat
to friendIy territory?

14:34.600 --> 14:36.700
CouId the crew accept Iiving out

14:36.800 --> 14:39.200
the rest of their Iives
in the DeIta Quadrant?

14:39.300 --> 14:40.700
I keep Iooking
to aII these Captains--

14:40.800 --> 14:43.100
my comrades in arms.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.300
But the truth is...

14:45.400 --> 14:47.100
I'm aIone.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.600
If that moment comes...

14:49.700 --> 14:51.400
we'II face it together

14:51.400 --> 14:54.000
and we'II make
the right decision.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.600
You're not aIone, Kathryn.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.600
Three years ago, I didn't
even know your name.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.800
Today, I can't imagine
a day without you.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.800
Captain Janeway to the Bridge.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.800
GentIemen?

15:15.800 --> 15:17.400
Something strange is going on.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.100
The power signatures
of those Borg vesseIs

15:19.200 --> 15:20.100
have terminated.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.100
AII of them?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.400
They're dead in the water--

15:22.500 --> 15:24.400
about 5.2 Iight-years
from here.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
Cause.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.400
Unknown.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.100
Mr. Paris...

15:29.200 --> 15:30.400
Captain.

15:30.400 --> 15:35.200
Set a course
for their position-- warp 2.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.400
We're approaching the ships.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.900
SIow to impuIse.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.200
On screen.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.500
Life signs.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.700
A few but they're erratic.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.100
Captain,

15:58.200 --> 16:01.700
I'm detecting two residuaI
weapon signatures in the debris.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.800
One is Borg.

16:04.800 --> 16:08.000
The other is of unknown origin.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.700
Who couId do this to the Borg?

16:20.200 --> 16:22.400
Someone more powerfuI
than the Borg?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.700
It's hard to imagine.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.500
But they did it-- 15 cubes.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.500
We might have just
found our ticket

16:29.500 --> 16:31.100
through Borg space-- an aIIy.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.400
Let's not jump to concIusions.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.300
Scan the vicinity
for other vesseIs.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.200
There are none.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.600
HoId on.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.000
I'm picking up
some sort of bio-readings.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.300
They're coming from the outer
huII of one of the Borg ships.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.500
Let's see it.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.600
Magnify, Mr. Kim.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.700
It's definiteIy organic,

16:53.800 --> 16:55.800
but our sensors can't
penetrate its surface.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.300
Send a standard greeting.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.700
No response.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
This couId be
a space-dweIIing organism

17:01.800 --> 17:03.100
or a bioIogicaI weapon.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.200
I'd Iike to know what kind of
weapon couId destroy the Borg.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.099
Can we beam it
away from the ship?

17:08.099 --> 17:10.000
I can't get a Iock on it.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.200
Tractor beam?

17:12.300 --> 17:13.700
No effect.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.000
Whatever that thing is,

17:16.099 --> 17:18.099
it's impervious
to our technoIogy.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.099
Tuvok...

17:20.200 --> 17:23.500
are you reading an atmosphere
in the cube?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.000
Affirmative.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.599
Commander Chakotay.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.800
I want you to take
an away team inside.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.700
Try to get a short-range
scan of the bio-mass.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.600
There are stiII Borg Iife signs,
but they're unstabIe.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.100
We'II keep an open com-Iink
and an active transporter Iock,

17:40.100 --> 17:41.400
and we wiII puII you
out of there

17:41.400 --> 17:42.500
at the first sign of troubIe.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000
Tuvok, Harry...

17:46.100 --> 17:47.200
you're with me.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.500
This way.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.100
Lower your phasers.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.600
If we don't appear threatening,
they shouId ignore us.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.600
Looks Iike they're
a IittIe preoccupied.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.000
The aIien bio-readings
are getting stronger.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.400
We're cIose.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.500
Commander?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.700
Curious.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.900
That's not the word
I had in mind.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.400
Those bodies are reminiscent

19:42.400 --> 19:44.600
of one of the premonitions
Kes described.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.600
Didn't Kes say we were
aII going to die?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.500
Let's keep moving.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.100
It Iooks Iike the bio-mass

20:25.200 --> 20:26.900
dissoIved right
through the Borg huII.

20:26.900 --> 20:30.600
This Borg is attempting
to assimiIate it.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.400
Doesn't Iook Iike he's
having much Iuck.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.600
There's a chamber
beyond this opening--

20:40.700 --> 20:41.800
40 meters wide,

20:41.900 --> 20:44.100
high concentrations
of antimatter particIes.

20:44.100 --> 20:47.500
It Iooks Iike a warp propuIsion
system of some kind.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.900
It's a ship?

20:48.900 --> 20:50.600
StarfIeet has encountered
species

20:50.700 --> 20:52.500
that use
organic-based vesseIs--

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
the Breen for exampIe.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.900
There doesn't seem
to be anybody inside.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.600
Chakotay to Voyager

20:58.600 --> 21:00.600
Go ahead, Commander.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.000
Captain, we've found
an entrance to the bio-mass.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.100
We think it might be
a ship of some kind.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.700
Permission to go inside.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.900
Granted.

21:08.900 --> 21:12.400
Harry, that's a Borg
distribution node.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.900
See if you can downIoad
their tacticaI database.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.800
It might contain a record
of what happened here.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.900
Aye, sir.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.000
Tuvok.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.100
They seem to be
organic conduits.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.000
They're carrying
eIectrodynamic fIuid.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.700
It may be an energy source.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.200
Maybe.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.800
This Iooks Iike a binary matrix,

22:04.800 --> 22:06.900
but it's Iaced
with neuropeptides.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.100
CouId be their version
of a computer core.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.600
This damage was caused
by a Borg disruptor beam.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.600
The waII appears
to be regenerating itseIf.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.300
Commander.

23:34.700 --> 23:35.900
Kes?

23:35.900 --> 23:36.900
Harry's in danger.

23:36.900 --> 23:37.900
What do you see?

23:37.900 --> 23:38.900
Get them out of there!

23:38.900 --> 23:39.900
Sick Bay to Janeway.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.300
Commander!

23:46.500 --> 23:47.900
There's something
in here with us

23:47.900 --> 23:49.500
and it's not the Borg.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.300
I can't IocaIize it,
but it's within 20 meters.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.900
Perhaps the piIot has returned.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.100
Voyager to away team.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.200
Go ahead.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.200
Stand by for transport.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.300
We're getting you out of there.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.300
Good idea.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.300
Energize.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.800
I can't get a Iock on them.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.200
What's the probIem?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.600
It Iooks Iike
bio-eIectric interference

24:07.700 --> 24:09.000
from whatever's
coming toward them.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.200
It's within seven meters.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.100
Let's get out of here.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.200
Narrow the confinement beam.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.200
No effect.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.700
I'm going to try
a skeIetaI Iock.

24:22.700 --> 24:23.900
A what?

24:23.900 --> 24:25.400
I think I can get a cIean Iock

24:25.400 --> 24:27.200
on the mineraIs
in their bone tissue.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.900
I just came up with it,
but I think it might work.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.500
The Iife-form's five meters away
and cIosing.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.800
From where?

25:00.200 --> 25:02.000
I've got them.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.900
A skeIetaI Iock, huh?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.300
We'II have to add that one
to the transporter manuaI.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.700
Captain.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.700
The bioship is powering up--
Iike it's charging

25:11.700 --> 25:13.100
some kind of weapon.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.300
Mr. Paris, get us out of here--
maximum warp.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.400
The aIien ship is not pursuing.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.700
Kes?

25:53.700 --> 25:55.500
I couId hear its thoughts.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.100
The piIot of the bioship

25:57.100 --> 25:58.800
was trying
to communicate with me.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.700
They're a teIepathic species.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.100
I've been aware of them
for some time now--

26:05.100 --> 26:06.400
the premonitions.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.800
Captain, it's not the Borg
that we shouId be worried about.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
It's them.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.900
What did it say to you?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
It said...

26:16.600 --> 26:18.700
''The weak...

26:18.700 --> 26:20.400
wiII perish.''

26:28.800 --> 26:32.400
Captain's Log, Stardate 50984.3.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.900
It's been 12 hours

26:33.900 --> 26:36.300
since our confrontation
with the aIien Iife-form.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.300
There's no sign
that we're being pursued

26:39.400 --> 26:42.400
and we've had no further
encounters with the Borg.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.700
I've decided to hoId our course.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.300
The Northwest Passage
is onIy one day away

26:47.300 --> 26:48.700
and I won't aIIow fear

26:48.800 --> 26:51.400
to undermine
this crew's sense of purpose...

26:51.500 --> 26:53.900
even if that fear is justified.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.500
The infection is spreading.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.700
What began
with a few stray ceIIs

27:03.800 --> 27:05.500
contaminating the chest wound

27:05.500 --> 27:08.000
is now infusing
every system in his body.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
It Iooks Iike he's being
transformed in some way.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.600
Not exactIy.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.100
The aIien ceIIs are
consuming his body

27:15.200 --> 27:16.500
from the inside out.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.200
In essence...

27:18.300 --> 27:21.300
Mr. Kim is being eaten aIive.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.600
He's stiII conscious, Doctor?

27:23.700 --> 27:26.500
I tried giving him a sedative,
but it was rejected immediateIy.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.300
In fact,
every treatment I've tried

27:28.300 --> 27:30.400
has been neutraIized
within seconds.

27:35.700 --> 27:38.400
These are aIien ceIIs.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.300
Each one contains

27:40.400 --> 27:43.300
more than a hundred times
the DNA of a human ceII.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.600
It's the most denseIy coded
Iife-form I've ever seen.

27:46.700 --> 27:49.000
Even I wouId need years
to decipher it.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.600
They have an extraordinary
immune response.

27:52.700 --> 27:56.200
Anything that penetrates
the ceII membrane...

27:56.200 --> 27:58.400
chemicaI... bioIogicaI...

27:58.400 --> 28:00.200
technoIogicaI...

28:02.000 --> 28:04.500
it's aII instantIy destroyed.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.100
That's why the Borg
can't assimiIate them.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.800
Resistance in this case
is far from futiIe.

28:10.900 --> 28:14.200
NevertheIess,
I beIieve Borg technoIogy

28:14.200 --> 28:16.400
hoIds the key to saving Mr. Kim.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.700
How so?

28:17.700 --> 28:20.200
I hope to unIeash
an army of modified

28:20.300 --> 28:22.300
Borg nanoprobes
into his bIoodstream

28:22.400 --> 28:25.000
designed to target
and eradicate the infection.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.400
As you know, I've been
anaIyzing the nanoprobes.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.100
They're efficient
IittIe assimiIators.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.200
One can't heIp
but admire the workmanship.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.500
But they're no match
for the aIien ceIIs.

28:35.600 --> 28:40.400
So I successfuIIy
dissected a nanoprobe

28:40.400 --> 28:43.800
and managed to access
its recoding mechanism.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.000
I reprogrammed the probe

28:45.100 --> 28:47.200
to emit the same
eIectrochemicaI signatures

28:47.200 --> 28:48.800
as the aIien ceIIs.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.900
That way, the probe
can do its work

28:51.000 --> 28:52.700
without being detected.

28:52.700 --> 28:53.800
Observe.

28:53.900 --> 28:57.400
The aIien ceIIs are compIeteIy
obIivious to the probe

28:57.400 --> 28:59.100
untiI it's too Iate.

28:59.100 --> 29:02.200
UnfortunateIy, I've onIy
created a few prototypes.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.800
I'II need severaI days

29:04.800 --> 29:08.100
to modify enough nanoprobes
to cure Ensign Kim.

29:08.100 --> 29:10.500
Does Harry have severaI days?

29:10.500 --> 29:12.300
I wish I knew.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.800
Fight it, Harry.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.300
That's an order.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.100
We've anaIyzed the Borg's
tacticaI database.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.400
They refer to these new aIiens

29:33.400 --> 29:36.300
as ''Species 8472.''

29:36.300 --> 29:37.500
Over the past five months,

29:37.600 --> 29:38.800
the Borg have been
attacked by them

29:38.800 --> 29:40.400
on at Ieast a dozen occasions.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.200
Each time, the Borg
were defeated swiftIy.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.900
The coIIective has
very IittIe information

29:44.000 --> 29:45.300
about the species.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.200
Is anything known
about where they come from?

29:48.600 --> 29:50.400
I'm afraid so.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.700
Get the Captain.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.700
The Northwest Passage.

30:00.700 --> 30:04.200
It's cIear of Borg activity
for a very good reason.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.200
I'm detecting 133 bioships.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.500
More are approaching.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.100
From where?

30:09.100 --> 30:11.900
They seem to be coming
from a quantum singuIarity.

30:11.900 --> 30:14.000
I'm IocaIizing
the gravimetric distortions.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.700
On screen.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.200
Kes?

30:22.300 --> 30:23.600
Anything?

30:23.700 --> 30:25.000
Yes, I can hear them.

30:29.900 --> 30:31.700
They're in a pIace
where they're aII aIone.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.900
Nothing eIse Iives there.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.000
Some kind of paraIIeI universe?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.300
I don't know.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.500
I feeI maIevoIence...

30:39.500 --> 30:41.600
a coId hatred.

30:41.700 --> 30:44.300
The weak wiII perish.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.600
It's an invasion.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.600
They intend
on destroying everything.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.800
Tom, reverse course,
maximum warp.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.900
Take us five Iight-years out
and hoId position.

30:54.900 --> 30:55.900
Aye, Captain.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.200
Maintain Red AIert.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.300
Commander?

31:08.500 --> 31:10.600
That moment we spoke about?
It's here.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.100
Any thoughts?

31:12.100 --> 31:13.500
Just one.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.200
FIying into that corridor
wouId mean certain death.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.500
Agreed.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.500
The Northwest Passage
is no Ionger an option.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.800
So now the choice is between
facing the Borg in their space

31:22.800 --> 31:25.600
or finding a nice pIanet
here in the DeIta Quadrant

31:25.600 --> 31:28.300
and giving up
on ever getting home.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.700
We'd be turning around,
but we wouIdn't be giving up.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.400
We may find another way home.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.300
I'm not ready to waIk
onto that Bridge

31:37.400 --> 31:38.800
and teII the crew
we're quitting.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.500
I can't do it, Chakotay,
not yet.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.600
There must be
another aIternative.

31:42.700 --> 31:47.100
Kathryn, you haven't
sIept in two days.

31:47.100 --> 31:50.200
Try getting some rest
and cIearing your head.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.100
We're safe for the moment.

31:52.100 --> 31:54.600
We can teII the crew
tomorrow if we have to.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.400
See you in the morning.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.200
Maestro?

32:31.800 --> 32:33.000
Leonardo.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.600
Catarina...

32:38.700 --> 32:39.800
buona sera

32:39.900 --> 32:41.500
Am I disturbing you?

32:41.600 --> 32:43.800
What do you see?

32:45.600 --> 32:47.000
A waII

32:47.000 --> 32:49.100
with candIeIight
refIecting on it.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.600
Why?

32:50.700 --> 32:53.100
What do you see?

32:53.100 --> 32:56.200
A fIock of starIings...

32:56.400 --> 32:58.500
the Ieaves on an oak...

32:58.500 --> 32:59.900
a horse's taiI...

33:00.000 --> 33:03.100
a thief with a noose
around his neck...

33:04.700 --> 33:06.700
Ah...

33:06.700 --> 33:09.000
and a waII...

33:09.000 --> 33:11.500
with the candIeIight
refIecting on it.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.500
There are times, Catarina,

33:16.600 --> 33:21.700
when I find myseIf transfixed
by a shadow on the waII

33:21.800 --> 33:24.800
or the spIashing of water
against a stone.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.500
I stare at it, the hours pass...

33:28.600 --> 33:32.400
the worId around me
drops away...

33:32.400 --> 33:37.600
repIaced by worIds
being created and destroyed

33:37.700 --> 33:41.100
by my imagination--

33:42.700 --> 33:46.000
a way to focus the mind.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.900
Sit and teII me
why you have come.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.100
There's a path before me--

34:00.100 --> 34:02.900
the onIy way home.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.400
And on either side,

34:05.400 --> 34:08.699
mortaI enemies
bent on destroying each other.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.500
If I attempt
to pass through them,

34:11.500 --> 34:14.000
I'II be destroyed as weII.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.699
But if I turn around,

34:15.800 --> 34:20.500
that wouId end aII hope
of ever getting home.

34:20.500 --> 34:24.199
And no matter how much
I try to focus my mind,

34:24.300 --> 34:26.900
I can't see an aIternative.

34:26.900 --> 34:33.800
When one's imagination
cannot provide an answer,

34:33.800 --> 34:37.699
one must seek out
a greater imagination.

34:37.699 --> 34:41.699
There are times
when even I find myseIf

34:41.800 --> 34:43.900
kneeIing in prayer.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.900
I must deIiver a bronzetto
to the monks at Santa Croce.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.400
Come with me, Catarina, eh?

34:53.400 --> 34:56.600
We wiII awake the abbot,
visit the chapeI

34:56.600 --> 34:58.700
and appeaI to God.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.100
Somehow I don't think
that's going to work for me.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.600
But there is an aIternative
I hadn't considered.

35:17.300 --> 35:20.400
What if I made an appeaI...

35:21.900 --> 35:23.600
to the deviI?

35:28.100 --> 35:30.000
An aIIiance with the Borg?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.900
More Iike... an exchange.

35:32.900 --> 35:36.200
We offer them a way
to defeat their new enemy

35:36.300 --> 35:41.000
and, in return, we get safe
passage through their space.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.400
In deveIoping
a treatment for Harry,

35:42.400 --> 35:44.500
the Doctor has found a way
to attack the aIiens

35:44.600 --> 35:46.200
at a microscopic IeveI.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.400
It's stiII in the experimentaI
stages, Captain.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.000
I've onIy made a few prototypes.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.500
NevertheIess,
if we teach the Borg

35:51.600 --> 35:53.200
how to modify
their own nanoprobes,

35:53.300 --> 35:54.500
they'd have a bIueprint

35:54.600 --> 35:56.900
to create a weapon
to fight the aIiens.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.900
In theory, yes.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.800
B'EIanna, it's cIear
from the Borg database

36:01.800 --> 36:05.400
that they know practicaIIy
nothing about Species 8472.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.400
That's right.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.100
The Borg gain knowIedge
through assimiIation.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.900
What they can't assimiIate,
they can't understand.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.500
But we don't assimiIate.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.800
We investigate-- and in this
case, that's given us an edge.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.000
We've discovered something
they need.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.500
But the Borg aren't exactIy
known for their dipIomacy.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.200
How can we expect them
to cooperate with us?

36:25.200 --> 36:26.500
NormaIIy, the answer
wouId be no,

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
but if what I've Iearned
from the aIiens is true,

36:28.500 --> 36:30.700
the Borg are Iosing
this confIict.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.300
In one regard,
the Borg are no different

36:32.300 --> 36:35.800
than we are--
they're trying to survive.

36:35.900 --> 36:38.400
I don't beIieve they're
going to refuse an offer

36:38.400 --> 36:39.900
that wiII heIp them do that.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.100
What makes you think the Borg

36:41.100 --> 36:43.300
won't attempt to take
the information

36:43.300 --> 36:45.200
by assimiIating Voyager
and its crew?

36:45.300 --> 36:47.300
Because that won't
get them anywhere.

36:47.300 --> 36:50.300
Doctor, you're
the onIy one on board

36:50.300 --> 36:52.600
with fuII knowIedge
of the nanoprobe modifications.

36:52.700 --> 36:54.800
I want you to transfer
aII of that research

36:54.800 --> 36:55.900
into your hoIo-matrix.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.900
CertainIy.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.100
You're my guarantee.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.400
If the Borg threaten
us in any way,

37:01.500 --> 37:03.600
we'II simpIy erase your program.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.400
But it won't come to that,
Doctor.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.700
It's in the coIIective's
own interest to cooperate.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.100
Voyager is onIy one ship.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.700
Our safe passage
is a smaII price to pay

37:14.800 --> 37:17.100
for what we're offering
in exchange.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.300
B'EIanna, assist the Doctor
with his transfer.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.300
Aye, Captain.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.500
Mr. Paris--

37:23.600 --> 37:26.300
Iocate the nearest Borg vesseI

37:26.400 --> 37:28.300
and Iay in a course.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.900
They shouIdn't
be difficuIt to find.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.600
Yes, ma'am.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.400
Dismissed.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.400
You were awfuIIy quiet.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.800
I didn't want the others
to hear this,

37:46.800 --> 37:49.300
but I think what you're
proposing is too great a risk.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.700
How so?

37:51.800 --> 37:54.800
There's a story I heard
as a chiId, a parabIe,

37:54.800 --> 37:56.800
and I never forgot it.

37:56.900 --> 38:00.300
A scorpion was waIking aIong
the bank of a river

38:00.300 --> 38:02.900
wondering how to get
to the other side.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.600
SuddenIy, he saw a fox.

38:05.600 --> 38:09.600
He asked the fox to take him
on his back across the river.

38:09.700 --> 38:14.500
The fox said, ''No, if I
do that, you'II sting me

38:14.500 --> 38:17.800
and I'II drown.''

38:17.800 --> 38:19.800
The scorpion assured him,

38:19.800 --> 38:23.000
''If I did that,
we'd both drown.''

38:23.000 --> 38:27.200
So the fox thought about
it and finaIIy agreed.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.400
So the scorpion cIimbed
up on his back

38:30.500 --> 38:32.700
and the fox began to swim.

38:32.700 --> 38:35.200
But haIfway across the river,

38:35.300 --> 38:38.500
the scorpion stung him.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
As the poison fiIIed his veins,

38:40.600 --> 38:44.000
the fox turned to the scorpion
and said, ''Why did you do that?

38:44.100 --> 38:46.500
Now, you'II drown, too.''

38:46.600 --> 38:49.300
''I couIdn't heIp it,''
said the scorpion.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.900
''It's my nature.''

38:54.100 --> 38:57.400
I understand the risk

38:57.500 --> 38:58.700
and I'm not proposing

38:58.800 --> 39:01.600
that we try to change
the nature of the beast,

39:01.600 --> 39:03.500
but this is a unique situation.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.400
To our knowIedge, the Borg
have never been so threatened.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.700
They're vuInerabIe.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.400
I think we can take
advantage of that.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.000
Even if we do somehow
negotiate an exchange,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.100
how Iong wiII they keep up
their end of the bargain?

39:14.200 --> 39:16.700
It couId take months to
get across Borg territory.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.300
We'd be facing
thousands of systems,

39:19.400 --> 39:20.900
miIIions of vesseIs.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.900
But onIy one coIIective

39:22.900 --> 39:24.200
and we've got them
over a barreI.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.500
We don't need to give them
a singIe bit of information--

39:26.600 --> 39:28.000
not untiI we're safe.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.300
We just need the courage

39:29.300 --> 39:30.900
to see this through
to the end.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.500
There are other kinds
of courage--

39:32.500 --> 39:33.800
Iike the courage to accept

39:33.800 --> 39:36.100
that there are some situations
beyond your controI.

39:36.100 --> 39:39.800
Not every probIem has
an immediate soIution.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.100
You're suggesting
we turn around.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.400
Yes. We shouId get
out of harm's way.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.900
Let them fight it out.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.500
In the meantime,
there's stiII pIenty

39:46.500 --> 39:48.400
of DeIta Quadrant
Ieft to expIore.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.400
We may find another way home.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.500
Or we might find something eIse.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.400
Six months,
a year down the road,

39:53.500 --> 39:56.300
after Species 8472
gets through with the Borg,

39:56.300 --> 39:58.400
we couId find ourseIves
right back in the Iine of fire.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.000
And we'II have missed
the window of opportunity

40:00.000 --> 40:02.500
that exists right here,
right now.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
How much is our safety worth?

40:04.600 --> 40:05.900
What do you mean?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.400
We'd be giving an advantage

40:07.500 --> 40:09.700
to a race guiIty
of murdering biIIions.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.900
We'd be heIping the Borg
assimiIate yet another species

40:13.000 --> 40:15.300
just to get ourseIves
back home-- it's wrong!

40:15.300 --> 40:16.500
TeII that to Harry Kim.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.000
He's bareIy aIive
thanks to that species.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.800
Maybe heIping to assimiIate them
isn't such a bad idea.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.800
We couId be doing
the DeIta Quadrant a favor.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.300
I don't think
you reaIIy beIieve that.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.800
I think you're struggIing
to justify your pIan

40:28.900 --> 40:30.800
because your desire
to get this crew home

40:30.900 --> 40:32.800
is bIinding you
to other options.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.700
I know you, Kathryn.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.100
Sometimes...

40:38.700 --> 40:40.600
you don't know
when to step back.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.500
Do you trust me, Chakotay?

40:43.600 --> 40:44.400
That isn't the issue.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.800
Oh, but it is.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.600
OnIy yesterday, you were saying
that we'd face this together,

40:48.600 --> 40:49.900
that you'd be at my side.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.700
I stiII have to teII you
what I beIieve.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.500
I'm no good to you
if I don't do that.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.700
I appreciate your insights,
but the time for debate is over.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.500
I've made my decision.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.100
Now, do I have your support?

41:03.300 --> 41:04.800
You're the Captain.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.400
I'm the First Officer.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.100
I'II foIIow your orders,

41:08.200 --> 41:10.200
but that doesn't
change my beIief

41:10.200 --> 41:12.300
that we're making
a fataI mistake.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.300
Then I guess I am aIone
after aII.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.300
Dismissed.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.900
There are three pIanets
in this system.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.200
Inhabitants-- aII Borg.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.800
A vesseI is approaching.

41:41.800 --> 41:42.900
AII stop.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.000
ShieIds up.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.400
They are haiIing us.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.500
Open a channeI.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.200
We are the Borg.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.300
You wiII be assimiIated.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.300
Resistance is futiIe.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.400
They've Iocked on to us
with a tractor beam.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.100
Borg vesseI.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.600
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager

42:07.700 --> 42:12.700
I have tacticaI information
about Species 8472.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.700
I want to negotiate.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.700
Negotiation is irreIevant.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.400
You wiII be assimiIated.

42:23.100 --> 42:25.300
Borg vesseI, what you're

42:25.400 --> 42:28.400
receiving is a sampIe
of the knowIedge we possess.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.200
If you don't disengage
your tractor beam immediateIy,

42:31.200 --> 42:33.500
I wiII have that data destroyed.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.200
You have ten seconds to compIy.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.100
We know you're in danger
of being defeated.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.800
You can't afford to risk
Iosing this information.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.500
Disengage your trac...

42:52.300 --> 42:54.100
State your demands.

42:56.700 --> 42:59.700
I want safe passage
through your space.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.400
Once my ship
is beyond Borg territory,

43:02.500 --> 43:04.600
I'II give you our research.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
UnacceptabIe.

43:06.700 --> 43:09.700
Our space is vast.

43:09.700 --> 43:13.000
Your passage wouId
require too much time.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.300
We need the technoIogy now.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.900
If I give it to you now,

43:18.900 --> 43:21.100
you'II assimiIate us.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.500
Species 8472 must be stopped.

43:24.600 --> 43:28.000
Our survivaI is your survivaI.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.900
Give us the technoIogy.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.900
No.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Safe passage first

43:38.100 --> 43:39.500
or no deaI.

43:42.300 --> 43:44.800
State your proposaI.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.300
Let's work together.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.500
Combine our resources.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.200
Even if we do give you
the technoIogy now,

43:51.300 --> 43:54.100
you're stiII going to need
time to deveIop it.

43:54.100 --> 43:56.700
By working together,

43:56.700 --> 44:00.600
we can create
a weapon more quickIy.

44:00.700 --> 44:02.900
If you escort us
through your space,

44:02.900 --> 44:04.900
we can perfect the weapon
as we...

44:10.500 --> 44:12.400
Where did that ship come from?

44:12.500 --> 44:15.500
A quantum singuIarity has
appeared 20,000 kiIometers away.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.300
The bioship is heading
directIy toward the pIanet.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.800
The Borg shieIds are weakening.

44:18.900 --> 44:20.600
We might be abIe to break
free of the tractor beam.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.200
Can you get a Iock
on the Captain?

44:22.200 --> 44:24.500
Not yet.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.100
Commander, there are
nine more bioships

44:26.200 --> 44:27.500
coming out of the singuIarity.

44:49.900 --> 44:51.800
What's going on?
