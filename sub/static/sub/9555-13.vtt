Hey, Malph, where's Rich?

01:37.664 --> 01:39.063
The sax solo's coming up.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.325
Fake it. Fake it.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.764
I'm playing the piano.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.767
I... Stop.

01:42.903 --> 01:43.768
Stop the song, okay?

01:43.904 --> 01:45.497
L-I can't fake a sax solo.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.665
Guys, guys,
what's going on here?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.834
- No sax.
- No sax?

01:50.978 --> 01:53.037
You've got to have a sax.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.739
All right, come on, guys,
hit it!

01:54.881 --> 01:56.280
One, two...

01:56.416 --> 01:58.407
(playing harmonica)

02:02.623 --> 02:03.988
Jump in any place.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.218
(continues playing)

02:10.364 --> 02:12.458
I'm real sorry, guys.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.589
Sorry I'm late.

02:13.734 --> 02:14.860
What is this?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.868
RALPH:
It's your fault he's up there

02:17.004 --> 02:18.062
because you're late, Rich.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.570
All right, all right.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.231
Al, Al, Al, Al!

02:21.375 --> 02:23.343
You can stop now; Richie's here.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.411
(continues playing)

02:28.482 --> 02:30.473
Yeah. Top that one, baby!

02:35.889 --> 02:38.358
Okay, Rich, where were you?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.392
Look, I told you,
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.858
What more do you want me to say?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.191
- Well, a lot more than
"Sorry I'm late." -Yeah.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.662
RALPH: Come on, Rich,
you're half an hour late.

02:45.799 --> 02:46.823
Now, what's the real reason?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.162
You can tell us.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.235
Was it intrigue? Passion?

02:50.370 --> 02:51.599
This is ridiculous.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.228
I mean, you guys are making
a big deal out of nothing.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.898
- Nothing?
- Yeah, so I was tardy.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.874
- I was tardy.
- That's right. -Yeah.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.341
I'm sorry.
All right, dock me, you know.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.639
- All right.
- Fine me, fire me.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.579
What's the worst thing
you could possibly do?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.184
Isn't this a little drastic?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.513
Coming into the station.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.088
We have apprehended the suspect.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.121
Ten-four.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.224
Uh, suspect?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.621
Su... I'm not a suspect.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.022
- No, I'm not a suspect, guys.
- No.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.492
Yeah, that's what they all say.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.028
- Come on, kid, let's go.
- Wait a minute!

03:17.164 --> 03:18.222
Wait a minute!
That's our buddy!

03:18.365 --> 03:21.232
- You can't take him.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.586

03:41.722 --> 03:45.625
We're taking this man in
on a dragnet.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.524
You ever hear
of the local penal code four,

03:48.662 --> 03:52.030
subsection... subsection 66-A?

03:52.165 --> 03:54.634
Si-Six... 66-A?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.497
What is that one?
I forgot that one.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.400
(scoffs)
And he wears a badge, huh?

03:58.538 --> 03:59.937
-(laughter)
- Yeah.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.041
All right, listen up, huh?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.973
It says that you've got to tell

04:04.111 --> 04:05.806
the alleged perpetrator
of his charges.

04:05.946 --> 04:06.970
They do that?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.548
No! No, sir.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.616
They didn't tell me a thing.
Uh-uh.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.150
All right.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.446
We'll do it now.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.578
The charges are
breaking and entry,

04:15.722 --> 04:17.087
fleeing the scene of a crime,

04:17.224 --> 04:20.750
petty theft
and invasion of privacy.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.328
FONZIE: Ah, come on, give me
a break here, give me a break.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.021
My good friend Richie
Cunningham, editor of a paper.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.723
What do you think,
you got Jack the Ripper?

04:25.866 --> 04:27.265
No, no.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.337
What we got here
is the Kissing Bandit!

04:37.244 --> 04:39.110
<i>RY AN:
All right, bring them in.</i>

04:39.246 --> 04:41.476
All-all the way over here.
Right here.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.279
Come on. Come on.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.318
Come on, hurry it up.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.387
All right.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.514
Okay, that's good.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.251
Okay, everybody face forward.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.285
Forward!

04:56.429 --> 04:58.488
That's him!

04:58.632 --> 05:00.361
That's the man who kissed me!

05:00.500 --> 05:02.298
Uh, which-which one,
Mrs. Kowalski?

05:02.435 --> 05:04.199
The innocent-looking one.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.912
I'll remember those burning lips
the rest of my life.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.678
Burning lips?!

05:17.818 --> 05:19.308
Lady, these lips do not burn!

05:19.452 --> 05:21.921
I mean, ask anybody!

05:22.055 --> 05:23.716
I think she better take
another look, sir.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.018
RYAN:
All right, everybody out.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.648
Everybody out.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.727
Dad?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.091
Hi. (chuckles)

05:30.230 --> 05:32.289
You'll never guess where I am.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.422
No.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.198
No.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.531
Yes.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.867
He guessed it.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.498
Okay. All right, so you got
an alibi for tonight.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.270
How about, uh... how about
the night of the 18th?

05:45.412 --> 05:46.504
Oh, do I... That's easy.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.080
Uh, that was a Saturday night.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.240
Uh, so I had a date
with Lori Beth.

05:50.383 --> 05:51.407
Oh, that's right.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.518
That's good, very good.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.881
Uh, where'd you go?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.146
Inspiration Point.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.313
Ooh, the, uh...
the kissing place, huh?

05:57.457 --> 05:58.322
Well, yeah.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.153
I mean, uh,
Sweet Knees and I, we...

06:00.293 --> 06:01.556
Sweet Knees?

06:01.695 --> 06:02.890
Uh, it's a nickname.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.019
She calls me Sizzle Lips.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.029
(chuckles)
Sizzle Lips?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.860
I think I need a lawyer.

Chain gangs, breaking rocks.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.618
Marion, this whole thing
is a mistake.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.231
Now, they're gonna let him out

06:38.365 --> 06:41.096
filling out this form

Richie is the Kissing Bandit.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.568

07:12.966 --> 07:15.230
Are you waiting for
a convict, too?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.398
No, no.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.667
I'm, uh... I'm waiting
to be transferred.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.640
I'm a confidence man.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.475
Well, having confidence
in yourself is very important.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.487
You know, madam,
you have a very honest face.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.918
Tell me, have you ever
given thought

07:36.056 --> 07:37.421
to where you and your husband

07:37.557 --> 07:39.286
would like to spend
your retirement years?

07:39.426 --> 07:42.396
- Uh, Mom... -Please, dear,
we're talking retirement.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.328
Well, my husband has always
wanted to retire in Florida.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.024
I knew it. I had a feeling.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.657
It just so happens that

07:48.802 --> 07:51.863
I am the owner of
60 lush acres in Florida.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.837
But I've always been
taken with the west.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.569
Exactly! 60 pine-studded acres
in Colorado.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.236
Oh, what luck!

08:01.181 --> 08:03.707
Are they gonna
let Richie out, Dad?

08:03.850 --> 08:06.547
Sergeant says
we have to wait our turn.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.383
Oh, Howard, I'm so worried.

08:09.522 --> 08:10.785
Maybe when this is all over,

08:10.924 --> 08:13.188
we should move away
and get a fresh start.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.818
Move to where, Marion?

08:15.962 --> 08:19.398
Well, there's a lovely spot
in Colorado.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.091
Oh, Howard,
I guess it's too late.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.794
I think
that policeman's buying it.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.364
Hi, Howard.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.168
Is there anything I could do?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.242
No, thanks, Al.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.776
We just have to wait our turn.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.140
Thanks for coming down, Al.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.405
Richard will appreciate it.

08:34.547 --> 08:35.946
You know, maybe we should've
lied for Rich.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.380
Yeah, we could've told them
he was kidnapped by Bigfoot.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.283
Everything will be fine
if we do the right thing.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.388
That's right. Marion's right.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.751
You got to be optimistic.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.757
You see, all of us Delvecchios
are all optimistic.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.225
I once had an uncle
that fell off of the top

08:49.362 --> 08:51.091
of a 14-story building.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.393
And when he was going
past the tenth story,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.867
he was heard to say,
"Well, so far, so good."

08:57.003 --> 08:59.267
Sit down, Al.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.500
It was just a joke.
He didn't fall.

09:01.641 --> 09:02.802
I was trying to cheer them up.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.808
- Good. Good job, Al.
- It was terrific, Al, really.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.878
- Yeah.
- Hi.

09:11.518 --> 09:14.249
Sit down, Vernon!

09:14.387 --> 09:15.286
All right.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.651
Mr. C., what's the matter?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.121
What, uh...
Did you pay the bail?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.693
No. I could barely
fill out the forms.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.818
Herman, pay that bail.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.058
All right.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.324
Cunningham's out.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.558
That's all right.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.998
I'll bring him right to you,
Mrs. C., huh?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.002
Cunningham, get out here!

09:32.138 --> 09:33.765
RICHIE:
I'm locked inside, Fonz.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.397
Not for long.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.707

09:45.618 --> 09:47.017
Fonz, that's great.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.211
Oh, this one's still locked.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.583
What?

09:49.722 --> 09:51.554
Must be on a different circuit.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.293
Oh, Richard,
it's so good to see you!

09:59.432 --> 10:01.400
Dad, thanks for
coming and getting me.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.559
Were you scared?
Did you cry in there?

10:03.703 --> 10:04.966
Cry?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.266
Well, sure I was scared,

10:06.406 --> 10:08.397
but you can't let
the other prisoners see you cry.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.804
Way to go, Rich.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.672
Sol hid my face in the pillow.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.939
Way to go, Rich.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.640
Oh, Arthur, thank you.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.774
We appreciate it so much.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.416
Well, come on, everybody.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.024
Let's get out of here
and go home.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.489
(excited chatter)

10:26.626 --> 10:28.788
I got to get
my personal possessions.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.260
Sign right there.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.626
Don't forget, Cunningham,

10:32.765 --> 10:35.325
you get arraigned
first thing in the morning.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.732
Arraigned. How could I forget?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.531
MARION:
Howard, did you hear that?

10:41.674 --> 10:42.607
Arraigned.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.471
Next thing,
it'll be the big house.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.841
Marion, everything is
gonna be all right.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.106
Now stop worrying.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.579
We'll get a lawyer;
it'll be just fine.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.184
Oh, I hope so. I hope so.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.785
Well, good-bye, everybody.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.284
If you're ever
in the neighborhood...

10:54.420 --> 10:56.411
Marion!

11:02.162 --> 11:05.154
(girls clamoring, squealing)

11:07.200 --> 11:08.964
Yeah, yeah, sure,
you like me now!

11:09.102 --> 11:11.127
You think
I'm the Kissing Bandit.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.002
Where were you
when I needed you?

11:14.140 --> 11:16.131
Richard, will you calm down.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.405
It's just a jungle out there.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.677
Well, how did it go
with-with the lawyer?

11:24.817 --> 11:26.649
How'd it go? How'd it go?

11:26.786 --> 11:29.278
Well, I'm telling you one thing,
lam not gonna cop a plea.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.821
Well, I should certainly
hope not, Richard.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.857
You're in
enough trouble already.

11:32.992 --> 11:35.586
Marion.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.492
Exactly what does
that mean, dear?

11:37.630 --> 11:40.099
Well, it means that
Richard has the option

11:40.233 --> 11:43.259
to plead guilty
to a lesser charge.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.303
He'll probably get
a suspended sentence.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.805
Probably a year's probation.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.670
And if he doesn't plead guilty?

11:49.809 --> 11:53.143
Then it goes to trial,
and he's either acquitted or...

11:53.279 --> 11:55.543
"Or"? Dad, I don't want
to hear about "or."

11:55.682 --> 11:57.548
Richard, you heard
what the lawyer said.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.152
They have an eyewitness.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.684
Now, that's pretty
strong evidence.

12:00.820 --> 12:01.810
I'm innocent.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.184
Doesn't that count
for something?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.984
Well, of course, it does.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.855
But sometimes innocent people
do get arrested.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.520
Yes, remember when Mother Kelp
was stopped at the border.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.825
Oh, let's not go
into that one, Marion.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.298
Now, look, Richard,

12:15.435 --> 12:16.925
we'll get another lawyer.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.630
I don't intend to sit by and see
you get railroaded into jail.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.638
(phone ringing)

12:21.774 --> 12:23.606
Hello.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.767
Oh.

12:24.911 --> 12:25.969
Richie, it's for you.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.479
It's, uh, WOW radio.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.312
They want to talk
to the Kissing Bandit.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.146
Oh, they do, huh?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.550
I'll take this call.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.678
Hello.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.793
(making kissing noises)

12:39.926 --> 12:41.860
How's that, bucko?!

12:47.734 --> 12:49.998
That's telling them, Richie.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.127
(girls squealing)

12:54.641 --> 12:57.133
It's a jungle out there.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.143
I mean, I knew you were
a little busy.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.270
- I sent them up to my place,
okay? -Ah, thanks, Fonz.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.439
They're really
wrecking the hedge.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.780
Hey, uh, what's the word
from the learned counsel?

13:06.919 --> 13:09.251
Oh, the word is
he's not so learned.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.585
Uh, they want Richie
to cop a plea.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.317
Hey, wrongamundo.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.018
It's not that easy, Fonzie.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.152
It's a very messy situation.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.459
You want to talk
about mess, huh?

13:19.599 --> 13:23.092
Mr. C., feast your eyes on this.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.464
"Kissing Bandit suspect caught."

13:28.608 --> 13:30.633
- That's me.
- That's terrible.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.302
Yeah, you're not kidding
it's terrible.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.937
They used my yearbook picture.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.640
Oh, and listen to this.

13:36.783 --> 13:40.413
"The manhunt was concluded
with the capture of..."

13:40.553 --> 13:42.214
They're not even looking
for the real guy.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.722
Oh, brother.
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

13:44.857 --> 13:48.191
Well, how about jumping bail?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.855
Now, look, Richie, it's always
darkest before the storm.

13:51.998 --> 13:52.897
That's "dawn," Fonz.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.295
It's always dark, ain't it?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.397
It's no reason
to throw in the towel.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.629
Fonzie's right.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.500
Now, look, I'm gonna make
some phone calls

14:00.640 --> 14:02.335
to see if I can get
another lawyer,

14:02.475 --> 14:04.967
one who's more positive.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.170
Well, we still have to eat.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.611
Come on, Joanie.
Let's fix dinner.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.080
(groans):
Oh.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.345
Just bread and water for me.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.482
The only way to end this,
you know,

14:17.623 --> 14:20.854
is to, uh, catch the bandit.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.688
How are we gonna
catch the bandit?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.490
The police can't even catch him.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.758
We lay a plan, Richie.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.264
Set a trap.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.425
- A trap?
- Yeah.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.798
What kind of bait would we use

14:30.937 --> 14:32.735
to, uh, catch
a kissing bandit anyway?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.273
Succulent lips.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.706
And I know just the pair.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.802
Here's what we're gonna do.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.642
FONZIE: Shortcake,
here are the tickets.

14:44.784 --> 14:45.774
<i>Right?</i>

14:45.918 --> 14:47.909
Have a great time tonight
at the movies.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.580
Well, Arthur, it is just
so thoughtful of you

14:50.723 --> 14:52.157
to treat us to a night out.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.123
It is my absolute pleasure.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.785
Y-You deserve to relax.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.625
Yeah, well I just don't feel
right about going out tonight.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.927
Oh, Mr. C., it's gonna take
your mind off everything.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.432
You're gonna have a great time.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.299
Oh, the show is <i>101</i> Dalmatians.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.496
L-I saw it.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.539
Let me tell you,
it's for the whole family.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.733
Oh, why don't we sit
in the balcony.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.538
You know, that's where
all the hunks sit.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.839
Great idea.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.439
Howard, remember how we used
to sit in the balcony?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.245
Not at a Disney movie, Marion.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.376
Oh, Dad.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.455
Sit anywhere you want.
Have a great time.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.886
Have a wonderful time.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.584
I feel like Eddie Haskell.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.923
All right, look, get down here!

15:30.062 --> 15:31.791
RICHIE:
This isn't gonna work, Fonz!

15:31.931 --> 15:32.955
Get down here.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.534
It's trap setting time.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.551
My place, 10:00.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.622
Be there.

15:57.757 --> 15:58.815
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.325
(laughs)

16:01.461 --> 16:03.623
All right.
How do my oranges look?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.162
A little higher.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.356
(high-pitched):
How do my oranges look?

16:06.499 --> 16:07.967
No, I meant your... Forget it.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.295
Would you just
zip me up, please?

16:09.435 --> 16:10.300
Yeah, yeah, I'll zip you up.

16:10.436 --> 16:11.597
All right, breathe in.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.227
- You breathing in?
- Yep.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.670
Now, what, what makes you think
that this Kissing Bandit

16:15.808 --> 16:17.640
is gonna show up
at this house, anyway?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.609
All right,
you can let your breath out now.

16:19.745 --> 16:20.940
I know his M.0.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.411
That's police talk.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.516
He follows a certain procedure,
you understand?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.674
Yeah.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.844
Number one:
comes through an open window.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.353
Give me your lipstick, Red.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.049
- Lipstick?
- Give me your lipstick.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.386
- Oh, Fonz, I already put the...
- Now.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.925
Oh, Fonz.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.756
Come on.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.728
All right.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.163
<i>Pucker'.</i>

16:41.300 --> 16:42.825
Number two:

16:42.969 --> 16:46.633
the last time he was on the
prowl was four blocks from here.

16:46.772 --> 16:47.898
You understand?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.906
That means he's moving in.

16:50.042 --> 16:54.070
Well, he better show up, 'cause
I'm not doing this anymore.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.510
Let me tell you something.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.844
You're gonna do this
for as long as it takes

16:57.984 --> 16:59.418
to catch this guy,
you understand?

16:59.552 --> 17:00.451
- Yeah.
- All right.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.451
Now, let me see my work.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.214
Come over here.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.483
Let me see my work.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.559
Rich, from the bottom
of my heart,

17:07.693 --> 17:10.025
you are as cute as a button.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.560
What do you want me to do?

17:11.696 --> 17:13.631
All right, look, look. I need
you to be very sexy, all right?

17:13.766 --> 17:15.097
- All right.
- Talk to me, sexy, talk to me.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.794
All right.

17:17.936 --> 17:21.964
Why don't you come up
and see me sometime?

17:23.309 --> 17:24.674
How was that, huh?

17:24.810 --> 17:25.971
Don't talk.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.212
But think sultry now,
think sultry.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.246
Yeah? All right.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.372
- Roll our shoulders.
- Yeah.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.915
We're gonna roll
our shoulders, right?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.850
(chuckles)

17:34.987 --> 17:36.751
Looks like you're rowing a boat.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.789
I don't know.

17:38.925 --> 17:39.790
All right, all right, all right.

17:39.926 --> 17:40.950
Now, do-do me a favor,
all right?

17:41.093 --> 17:42.390
Now, um, uh, an example.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.518
Marilyn Monroe, right?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.427
You seen her a lot
in the movies, right?

17:45.565 --> 17:46.532
Purse your lips.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.065
Here we go,
gonna purse your lips.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.362
Pout a little bit.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.471
I can live with it.
I can live with it.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.474
All right.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.078
Stand sexy like a girl.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.201
Stand like a girl.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.577
Nice. Nice lines.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.707
Rich, sit down.

18:13.059 --> 18:16.427
Would you sit with some...
some kind of sex appeal here?

18:16.562 --> 18:17.961
Oh, all right.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.724
All right?

18:23.703 --> 18:24.864
We're in trouble.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.632
- I hope this guy is nearsighted.
- Yeah, me, too.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.469
(whistling outside)

18:30.610 --> 18:31.771
That whistling?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.470
Wait, I bet you that's him!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.604
All right.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.680
Rich?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.947
Hey, Howie. Anyone home?

18:42.088 --> 18:43.249
Hey.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.016
(Ralph and Potsie scream)

18:45.157 --> 18:46.318
All right, talk to me.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.426
What are you guys doing here?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.652
Oh, sorry, Fonz.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.886
Sorry, ma'am.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.028
Potsie!

18:52.164 --> 18:55.759
(laughing)

18:55.901 --> 18:57.266
That's no ma'am!

18:57.403 --> 18:59.599
That's Richie!

18:59.739 --> 19:03.369
Hey, Rich, Rich... nice figure.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.501
(Ralph and Potsie laughing)

19:06.646 --> 19:08.444
All right,
now listen up, listen up!

19:08.581 --> 19:10.982
I ask you once again,
why are you guys here?

19:11.117 --> 19:12.778
We want to help.
(laughs)

19:12.918 --> 19:15.012
Yeah, we always help
ladies in distress.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.019
Hey. get off!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.554
Fonz, will you talk to him?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.317
All right, now, listen,
you can... you can help.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.926
You go upstairs.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.425
You guys are the lookouts.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.496
You take, uh, the north and the
east, the south and the west.

19:25.631 --> 19:26.598
- You got it?
- Yeah.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.325
- Go.
- All right, all right.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.992
We're the best lookouts in town.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.867
(Ralph and Potsie laughing)

19:33.005 --> 19:34.336
Come on, Potsie.

19:34.473 --> 19:35.531
All right.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.801
I'm going to my post, huh?

19:36.942 --> 19:37.932
Well, wish me luck, Fonz.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.546
Hey, course I wish you luck.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.546
Fonzie, you know,
when you think about

19:42.682 --> 19:43.911
what this guy is
putting me through--

19:44.050 --> 19:46.451
I mean, not only going to jail,
but dressing up like this.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.610
I mean, I got the shoes,
I got the lipstick,

19:48.754 --> 19:52.588
I got everything,
not to mention the oranges!

19:52.725 --> 19:54.454
Richard...

19:54.593 --> 19:57.290
do you know how beautiful
you are when you're angry?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.634
Later!

20:08.507 --> 20:10.498
<i>II</i>

20:28.627 --> 20:30.959
(shrieking)

20:31.097 --> 20:32.622
Don't be startled, precious.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.028
(high-pitched):
Oh, my goodness gracious!

20:34.166 --> 20:35.361
Let's just savor the moment.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.730
Oh, heavens to Betsy!

20:36.869 --> 20:38.428
Are you the, uh...

20:38.571 --> 20:41.233
Yes, I'm the man of your dreams.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.932
Then you're not the, uh...

20:43.075 --> 20:45.237
(giggles)

20:45.377 --> 20:46.867
...the Kissing Bandit?

20:47.012 --> 20:48.810
Just think of me as a person

20:48.948 --> 20:51.747
spreading my affections
to lovelies like yourself.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.784
You didn't happen to visit
a woman I know

20:53.919 --> 20:56.388
by the name of Mrs. Kowalski
the other night, did you?

20:56.522 --> 20:58.081
Oh, forget about her.

20:58.224 --> 21:00.158
Let's talk about you.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.659
And maybe later,
we'll have another kiss.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.924
- Another kiss?
- On the lips.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.466
On the lips?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.763
Oh, no, no.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.894
No, I'm just not
that kind of girl.

21:13.038 --> 21:13.937
Trust me.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.097
Oh, forget it, Rich.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.834
He's never gonna show.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.071
Oh, sorry, Rich.
We didn't know you had company.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.803
Grab him! Grab him!

21:21.947 --> 21:23.813
It's the Kissing Bandit!

21:23.949 --> 21:27.010
(shouting)

21:27.153 --> 21:28.712
Come on! Let's go!

21:30.723 --> 21:33.021
I got him! I got him! I got him!

21:37.129 --> 21:38.426
(shouting continues upstairs)

21:38.564 --> 21:40.862
Howard, why would
Ralph and Potsie and that lady

21:41.000 --> 21:42.866
be chasing that man
around our house?

21:43.002 --> 21:46.495
That was no lady, Marion,
that was our son!

21:46.639 --> 21:48.698
Why was he wearing
that terrible dress?

21:48.841 --> 21:50.775
That was yours, Mom.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.708
I'll never wear that again.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.506
RALPH: Quick!
Now he's in Joanie's room!

21:54.647 --> 21:55.876
POTSIE:
No, he's in my room!

21:56.015 --> 21:57.278
RICHIE:
You don't live here!

21:57.416 --> 21:58.281
Help! Help!

21:58.417 --> 21:59.282
He's after me now!

21:59.418 --> 22:00.977
It's the Kissing Bandit!

22:01.120 --> 22:02.884
Just try it, mister.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.457
Okay, let's see
how tough you are now.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.719
(all shouting)

22:09.795 --> 22:11.320
Watch it.
He pulled a vase on us.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.433
All right.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.298
Anybody comes near me, they're
really gonna get clobbered.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.531
Back!

22:19.672 --> 22:21.140
You, too, pops.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.241
"Pops"?

22:23.375 --> 22:26.276
I spend my nights trying to make
lonely women happy,

22:26.412 --> 22:28.540
and this is the thanks I get.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.649
Then you are for sure
the Kissing Bandit?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.182
Hey, you bet I am.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.844
Do you realize that an
innocent boy might go to jail?

22:34.987 --> 22:36.079
Better him than me.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.987
All right, back!

22:39.124 --> 22:40.853
So you thought
you could get me, huh?

22:40.993 --> 22:41.983
Well, nobody can.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.186
Not you, not the police, nobody.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.991
(laughs)

22:46.131 --> 22:47.656
I wouldn't go that far.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.665
Get over there.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.168
All right, Fonz!

22:51.303 --> 22:52.702
Sit down. Sit down.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.237
Take your hat off inside, huh?

22:54.373 --> 22:57.274
You know, you give lips
a bad name, Jack.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.638
- Fonz, you got him.
- Aaayyh.

22:58.777 --> 22:59.801
We got him!

22:59.945 --> 23:02.778
The trap worked,
and on the very first try, too.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.349
You don't even look like me.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.383
I don't have to go
to prison now.

23:06.518 --> 23:07.713
-(laughs)
-(sirens approaching)

23:07.853 --> 23:09.252
No, no making license plates.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.685
No exercise yard.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.552
No mean wardens.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.591
Gosh, it's good to be
on the outside again.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.458
Officer, arrest that animal!

23:17.596 --> 23:18.620
No, this animal.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.357
Thank you, Marion.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.467
He admitted he was
the Kissing Bandit.

23:22.601 --> 23:24.433
I'll testify to that.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.937
Okay, on your feet.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.064
Fonzarelli, uh,
thanks for the tip.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.110
I enjoy being a good citizen.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.111
Cunningham, uh...

23:35.247 --> 23:36.180
I'm sorry.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.305
You look cute.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.944
One for the road.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.076
Good night, precious.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.815
Come on.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.983
That's gonna cost you, fella!

23:48.127 --> 23:49.617
Marion, how could you?

23:49.762 --> 23:50.820
Really, Mom.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.021
Hey, you were great.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.155
- Oh, Fonz...
-(excited chatter)

24:02.274 --> 24:03.673
Ah, hot chocolate.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.574
That should really hit the spot.

24:06.712 --> 24:10.239
There are no marshmallows
in my hot chocolate.

24:10.382 --> 24:13.181
I'm sorry, Arthur,
I can't find them.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.619
I can't drink hot chocolate
without marshmallows.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.689
Richard, don't get lipstick
on the cup.

24:18.824 --> 24:21.759
(laughter)

24:24.330 --> 24:26.424
Oh.

24:26.565 --> 24:30.092
You know, Rich, the more I think
about it, the sillier it is.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.896
You, the Kissing Bandit.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.402
Wait a minute.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.633
Are you saying I couldn't
have been the Kissing Bandit?

24:35.774 --> 24:36.673
No way.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.675
You got it, brother.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.405
Well, I'm no bandit,
but I'll tell you one thing.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.481
I'm a heck of a kisser.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.811
These lips have seen
plenty of action.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.410
If these lips could talk.

24:51.457 --> 24:53.152
I found the marshmallows!

24:53.292 --> 24:55.989
She found the marshmallows.
