- You don't have to come, cousin.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.519

I went to the chocolate quarter with you.

Jerry Lee Lewis, from Ferriday, Louisiana,
your Aunt Mamie's boy.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.915
I heard about you.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.673
- They say you're a wild one.
- When it comes to playing this here piano

04:32.800 --> 04:35.792
you are looking at
the wildest mother of them all.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.230
- What are you doin' around here?
- Me and your dad are forming a band.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.753
I'm gonna be the main attraction. I've
got a ferocious God-given talent on me.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.509
We're goin' over to Sun Records.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.518
We're gonna eyeball Sam Phillips,
see if he can get us a deal.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.757
- Sam Phillips discovered Elvis, you know.
- I know.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.950
I got all Elvis's records.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.117
Oh, Elvis ain't so hot. He can't do this.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.440
You sure think a whole lot
of yourself, don't you?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.118
Sure I do.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.230
- Don't you?
- Me?

05:33.560 --> 05:36.120
I ain't nobody. I'm only 13.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.352
Well, you look all woman to Jerry Lee.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.596
Myra Gale, you better behave yourself.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.233
I am!

05:44.360 --> 05:47.193
Jerry Lee here's a married man.
Ain't that right, Jerry Lee?

05:47.320 --> 05:51.598
- Uh, that's not necessarily so, Lois.
- And just what do you mean by that?

05:51.720 --> 05:56.748
Well, you see, I was still married to my
first wife when I married my second wife,

05:56.880 --> 05:58.916
so I never really was married to her.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.759
And since I divorced my first wife
a couple of years ago,

06:01.880 --> 06:04.917
I'm as free as a bird in a tree.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.429
- Well, hello.
- Hey, babe.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.755
- (Jerry) Hey, you ready to go?
- Where?

06:11.880 --> 06:14.917
- Where? Sun Records.
- What, now?

06:15.040 --> 06:19.397
Hell, yeah, now. What do you think
I've been waitin' around all day for?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.669
- All right.
- Daddy, can I go too?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.758
Little girl, you stay home
and do your homework.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.237
(# "Honey Don't" by Carl Perkins)

06:32.360 --> 06:36.592
Sorry Mr Phillips couldn't be here. I'll play
those tapes for him soon as he gets back.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.918
Are you sure we recorded enough, Mr
Clement? I can play anything you want.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.794
You're good, boy, but a piano
ain't never gonna make you no money.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.639
Little girls like guitar players nowadays.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.358
They like to watch 'em wiggle around.
You can't do that behind a piano.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.310
# Hey, honey, don't

06:59.280 --> 07:00.679
# Honey, don't

07:03.840 --> 07:05.831
# Well, honey, don't

07:07.080 --> 07:08.752
# Say you will when you won't

07:08.880 --> 07:10.472
# Uh-uh, honey, don't

07:10.600 --> 07:15.037
So, what did Mr Sam Phillips
think of the great Jerry Lee Lewis?

07:15.160 --> 07:18.709
- He ain't heard him yet.
- But he will. It's a guaranteed fact.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.958
Thank you, Lord, for this,
your bountiful blessing.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.197
Protect and guide us
in your everlasting grace.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.029
For what we are about
to receive, we give thanks.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.116
- Amen.
- (Lois) Amen.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.199
Amen.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.073
Jerry Lee, have some of my meat loaf.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.036
Here you go.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.915
I'm takin' the car.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.556
What in holy hell is wrong with him?

07:52.680 --> 07:56.309
Sam Phillips was supposed
to be back four days ago.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.115
All this waitin's
drivin' poor Jerry Lee nuts.

08:11.760 --> 08:12.829
(sighs)

08:12.960 --> 08:15.713

- Roll it.

My brother here's got a real good feelin'
about that hot piece of wax you cats cut.

12:28.040 --> 12:33.114
I'm the legman here. I move
the merchandise. And it's movin' time.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.111
You gonna bust us flat in no time.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.518
Sam here don't understand that you
have to spend money to make money.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.790
- That makes sense.
- And Jud don't understand

12:46.920 --> 12:49.480
that you cannot spend
what you do not have.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.478
- You got a point there.
- And that is from the genius

12:52.600 --> 12:55.990
who sold Elvis Presley for $35,000.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.800

- On the dotted line.

- Maybe I'd better take a look at that first.
- You're the manager?

13:18.200 --> 13:21.192
Why, sure I am. Ain't that right, Jerry?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.196
Uh...

13:22.320 --> 13:26.996
Yes, Mr Phillips, he's my manager.
He's my bass player too. We're family.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.951

cos we trust you, Mr Phillips.

Yeah, but his word is "Don't".

16:21.880 --> 16:25.589
And I got this thing inside me
that says "Do, do, do".

16:25.720 --> 16:28.109
Don't you believe in God any more?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.672
Course I do. You know that I do.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.030

Roy Hall had a country version

- Yes, sir, but mine's rock and roll.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.836
Yeah, but, man, we can't
put out a song like that.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.916
Man, it's too suggestive.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.715
Everybody knows "whole lotta shakin" '
is what humpin' is all about.

21:39.840 --> 21:44.277
- That's why the kids are gonna love it.
- And the parents ain't gonna stand for it.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.313
- Play somethin' else.
- I can play anything, anywhere, anytime,

21:48.440 --> 21:51.159

has got 'em all beat.

29:14.120 --> 29:17.396

He is an action artist.

Jerry, I'd like to present you with this,
your first royalty cheque.

29:41.720 --> 29:45.918
There's more zeroes here than
there was Fs on my third-grade report.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.950
Is that $4,000?

29:51.080 --> 29:54.709
- No, cousin. That's $40,000.
- (Buddy) $40,000!

29:55.520 --> 29:57.556
Fifty-fifty, remember?

30:06.840 --> 30:09.752
Hasn't your song been banned
by several radio stations?

30:09.880 --> 30:13.714
- They say it's against God.
- Well, I don't understand that.

30:13.840 --> 30:18.834
I serve him gladly. I sing. I shout. It's not
my fault I don't play like some old lady.

Amen, Brother Lewis. Amen. Come on,
let's go and get these bags here.

but he's a good old boy.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.830
Well, yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.992
Well, shoot, cousin.
We're glad to have you here.

31:36.560 --> 31:40.314
Well, it just goes to show you
how important family really is.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.230
Sure is better than that old couch.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.318
Well, you just make yourself
right at home here, cousin.

- Oh, cones, cones, cones.

- Missy.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.833
Missy. That's a very nice name.

32:52.440 --> 32:56.194
- That'll be 20 cents.
- You think you could take it out of this?

32:56.880 --> 32:59.599
$40,000?!

33:00.840 --> 33:04.549
- We don't have that kind of change.
- Gosh, I'm sorry. That's all I've got.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.636
I got a dollar.

33:06.760 --> 33:09.035
Oh, it's on the house.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.720
Well, thank you very much.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.798
You can get free custard here
any time you want!

33:33.480 --> 33:37.553
I saw this thing at school.
They had this movie about the H-bomb.

33:37.680 --> 33:43.357
You know, the hydrogen bomb. About it
comin' and blowin' up the whole world.

33:43.480 --> 33:47.359
Oh, that's the Apocalypse.
That's in Revelations in your Bible.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.353
You know, I go on fine all day at school.

33:55.320 --> 33:59.199
And then at night, when I lay down,

33:59.680 --> 34:02.513
I think to myself...

34:02.640 --> 34:05.393
"Is this the night
the bomb's gonna come?"

34:09.400 --> 34:12.870
All I ever wanted was a little
pink house with a blue door.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.398
A little baby sittin' in a highchair.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.308
Who do you see comin' up the walk
of that pink house? Hm?

34:29.320 --> 34:31.275
I don't know.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.036
You don't know?

34:35.120 --> 34:36.438
Well?

34:36.560 --> 34:39.358
Do you think he might be about,
oh, six foot tall,

34:39.480 --> 34:43.996
with big blue eyes
and wavy, curly blond hair?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.076
(Myra giggles)

35:03.320 --> 35:04.673
What?

35:05.480 --> 35:07.914
Now maybe I won't have anything.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.077
This old horrible bomb's
gonna come and wipe it all away.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.997
Uh-uh.

35:14.720 --> 35:19.032
Everything'll be destroyed,
and this is as far as I'll ever get in life.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.513
Mm-mm.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.313
I don't even know what hydrogen is.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.118
And 1,000 makes $40,000.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.593
Sh!

36:04.560 --> 36:05.515
(squeal)

36:05.640 --> 36:07.596
- (Rusty) Pow!
- Urgh!

Hi!

36:47.560 --> 36:49.551
(woman) Hallelujah!

36:49.680 --> 36:51.352
Hallelujah!

36:51.480 --> 36:54.790
I had my car break down once
on the side of the road.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.718
And I got out and I laid hands
on the hood of this car

36:57.840 --> 37:01.753
and I said " Devil, if you think I've been
crazy before, you just wait one minute

37:01.880 --> 37:06.078
because I'm going to ask the Lord
to come down and heal this Plymouth."

37:06.200 --> 37:07.838
- Amen.
- Hallelujah.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.748
So I got down and I asked the Holy Spirit
to make her whole again

37:11.880 --> 37:17.193
and the Holy Spirit, lo and behold,
came down and made her good as new.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.397
Glory, hallelujah, praise God, brother.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.395
Well, this here is
my cousin, Jerry Lee Lewis.

37:26.520 --> 37:30.115
Y'all probably know him from that
blasphemous "Shakin" ' song he put out.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.435
Number four in the top ten
this week, cousin.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.393
Well, I really doubt
that it's in the Lord's top ten.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.476
Rock and roll is the devil's music.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.033
- Right.
- That's right.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.516
Rock and roll is a rhythm. A feelin'

37:42.640 --> 37:45.996
A feeling that emanates
from the pit of hell.

37:46.120 --> 37:49.396
- Right.
- Well, that feeling got me a hit record.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.756
A hit record.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.474
Do you still have that coin
I gave to you onetime?

37:58.600 --> 38:01.558
Oh, as a matter of fact...

38:01.680 --> 38:03.636
I do.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.432
Choices, Jerry Lee.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.358
This whole life is all about choices.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.837
What choice are you going to make
with your music? With your life?

38:14.840 --> 38:17.673
I don't play or sing as well as you do.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.189
I heard that.

38:20.320 --> 38:24.233
But all that I have belongs to God. All of it.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.796
What would happen
if you gave him all you have?

38:27.920 --> 38:32.789
Well, as a matter of fact, cousin,
I just might do that one day.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.638
(man) Praise God.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.354
- (Jimmy) What about today?
- What?

38:37.480 --> 38:40.950
Do you remember what you said
you would do if you got a hit record?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.753
You said you would go out
and preach his word.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.836
Did I say that?

38:45.960 --> 38:50.272
That's funny. I don't remember
sayin' that. I must have been drunk.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.676
But the Lord remembers, cousin.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.554
Well, is this that car
that God healed for you?

38:56.680 --> 38:59.752
Well, that was six months ago.
She's up and died on me now.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.030
Why don't you just lay hands on her here?

39:02.160 --> 39:05.436
- I'd like to see that myself.
- Cousin, you cannot ask the Lord

39:05.560 --> 39:09.075
for more help than you are willing
to help yourself. He's got me this far...

39:09.200 --> 39:14.194
Why don't you just let this old Oldsmobile
here get you a little further along?

39:16.120 --> 39:18.873
You made a choice just then, Jerry Lee.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.271
From your singin' came this car,

39:22.400 --> 39:25.551
and from this car will come
the spreading of God's word.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.636
(crowd) Amen.

39:28.320 --> 39:31.073
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Well, don't thank Jesus.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.634
Thank Jerry Lee Lewis.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.676
Praise God, cousin.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.233
- Let's go to bed, babe.
- OK.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.716
Bedtime, Myra Gale.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.240
Let them watch their movie.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.872

40:45.480 --> 40:48.074
Well, what do you think?

40:49.720 --> 40:51.199
You know, Jay,

40:51.320 --> 40:56.075
I reckon hooking up with Jerry Lee is
about the best thing ever happened to us.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.433
Look here what I'm gonna buy next.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.198
"The kitchen of tomorrow, today."

41:06.760 --> 41:11.675
- What in the hell are they doin' in there?
- Would you just leave them alone?

41:11.800 --> 41:14.155
They're just watchin' TV.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.073

41:22.640 --> 41:25.200

41:31.080 --> 41:33.036
Just a movie.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.355
Here comes the creepy mouse.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.399

Mr Freed, Jerry Lee Lewis can blow
Chuck Berry right off of that stage.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.997
Why do I have to go on before him?

44:06.120 --> 44:09.351
He's had six number one hits
and you've only had two in the top ten.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.870
- Who's got the number one record now?
- You.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.072
- My point exactly.
- He should go on before me.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.235
He can't. It's in his contract
that he closes the show.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.353
OK, cat. If that's the way you want it.

44:43.560 --> 44:44.959
# Well

44:45.080 --> 44:46.752
# Kiss me, baby

# Whoo!

44:49.440 --> 44:50.475

You take JW there. He don't have to fool
around. He's got the perfect wife.

Lois is a lady, first and foremost. Quiet
and reserved, always stylishly dressed.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.919
He never has to ask for his dinner
or hunt for clean socks.

47:49.040 --> 47:52.874
You gotta get 'em while they're young
and take 'em right from their mama,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.560
and you raise 'em up
right by you to keep 'em true.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.990

you would a bird dog.

- About me?

Oh, maybe.

48:12.320 --> 48:17.110

like this all the time?

Who are you talkin' to
at three o'clock in the mornin'

48:31.120 --> 48:34.874
- Well, what for, man?
- Cheerin' her up about her schoolwork.

48:35.520 --> 48:38.592
It was Jerry Lee, wasn't it? Don't lie.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.792
She don't need cheerin' up
ten times a day, now does she?

48:41.920 --> 48:44.992
- Answer me.
- Nothin' else to do.

48:46.760 --> 48:51.788
He's just feelin' far from home and he
wanted to hear a friendly voice is all.

48:53.200 --> 48:58.069
- Stop or we send you to boardin' school.
- Stop or we send her to boardin' school.

49:02.560 --> 49:05.313

# Yeah

50:26.040 --> 50:27.678
Argh!

50:35.720 --> 50:37.392
# Mm, come on, little baby

50:37.520 --> 50:39.476
# Let me show you what I love to do

50:40.600 --> 50:43.672
# Watch me now, mama,
I'm gonna burn off both my shoes

50:44.920 --> 50:48.390
# Oh, my heart's beating rhythm,
my soul's singin' the blues

50:48.520 --> 50:51.353
# Lord, I been a-boppin'
at the high-school hop

50:51.480 --> 50:53.391
# Shakin' at the high-school hop

50:53.520 --> 50:55.317
# Rollin' at the high-school hop

50:55.440 --> 50:57.351
# I been movin' at the high-school hop

50:57.480 --> 50:59.710

everybody's boppin'

50:59.840 --> 51:01.273
# Boppin' at the high-school hop

51:01.400 --> 51:03.356
# Dig it, mama

51:13.800 --> 51:16.519

51:33.160 --> 51:35.515
Where are we goin'

51:36.880 --> 51:41.715
Take a look in that glove compartment
there. I wanna show you somethin'

51:44.240 --> 51:46.754
It's a marriage licence.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.110
I... I thought you had to stand there
and say something.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.800
Well, it's only a permit, Myra.

51:57.440 --> 51:59.874
Oh, so we ain't married?

52:00.400 --> 52:02.595
Not yet.

52:03.640 --> 52:06.393
But that's my prayer.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.995
I'm asking you to marry me.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.917
Me?

52:14.760 --> 52:17.228
I love you.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.636
Oh, Jerry.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.560
Jerry, I'm only 13 years old.

52:28.680 --> 52:32.673
Oh, heck. My sister Frankie Jean,
she was only 12 when she got married.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.153
But...

52:37.800 --> 52:40.633
- But you're as old as my daddy.
- What?

52:40.760 --> 52:43.194
Oh, hell, I ain't that old.

52:43.320 --> 52:47.472
- Can't we just wait three or four years?
- Well, now, I've got two hit records.

52:47.600 --> 52:52.628
I got six months of dates booked up
in advance. I got me $100,000.

52:54.720 --> 52:57.154
What more do you need?

52:57.280 --> 53:00.192
I don't know. I... Just some time to think.

53:00.320 --> 53:03.278
Why don't you think about
that pink house with the blue door

53:03.400 --> 53:07.313
and that blue-eyed, blond-haired
son of God comin' up the walk?

53:27.120 --> 53:30.829
(man) Do you, Myra Gale Brown,

53:30.960 --> 53:34.748
take this man, Jerry Lee Lewis,

53:34.880 --> 53:37.713
to be your lawful wedded husband,

53:37.840 --> 53:42.391
to have and to hold from this day forward,

53:42.520 --> 53:45.637
till death do you part?

53:52.800 --> 53:54.472
Oh, uh...

53:54.600 --> 53:56.556
I do.

53:57.320 --> 54:01.552
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

54:13.440 --> 54:16.193
(# "Guaglione" by Pérez 'P rez' Prado)

54:29.560 --> 54:32.120
Who's gonna tell your folks?

54:36.120 --> 54:38.634
You. You tell 'em.

54:39.840 --> 54:41.831
No, you tell 'em.

54:43.880 --> 54:46.269
No, Jerry. You tell 'em.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.755
No, you tell 'em.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.356
These potatoes are real good.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.040
Well, thank you, Jerry Lee.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.792
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

55:28.920 --> 55:31.480
- We can't till they know.
- When are you gonna tell 'em?

55:31.600 --> 55:34.717
I thought you were gonna tell 'em.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.593
- All right. I'll tell 'em right now.
- No.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.873
By tomorrow night, I promise.

55:52.160 --> 55:53.513
(door slams)

55:57.320 --> 55:59.072
(car engine)

56:09.440 --> 56:12.750
There's some people acting
mighty funny around here.

56:36.760 --> 56:39.228
- Will you look at this?
- Rice.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.310
Oh, no.

56:48.240 --> 56:50.993
I knew it! They're married.

56:55.880 --> 56:59.759
- Jay, what are you doin'
- I'm gonna go kill that son of a bitch.

56:59.880 --> 57:01.472
Jay!

57:01.600 --> 57:03.158
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

57:08.480 --> 57:10.675
- Mr Phillips?
- Hey, man!

57:10.800 --> 57:15.078
- Son, son, son.
- Glad you could come in, Jerry.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.998
- We just been talking about you.
- I need to talk to you, too.

57:18.120 --> 57:20.509
Can you believe it's been almost a year

57:20.640 --> 57:23.473
since you first came to Sun
and cut your first record?

57:23.600 --> 57:26.956
And we sure have come a long way
since then, ain't we?

57:27.080 --> 57:28.433
Yes, sir.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.028
Your new song's comin' out
in a big movie.

57:31.160 --> 57:35.233
"High School Confidential" is gonna be
a bigger hit than "Great Balls of Fire".

57:35.360 --> 57:37.191
Thank you, but I've got...

57:37.320 --> 57:42.235
We got a brand-new
five-year contract to talk about.

57:43.640 --> 57:48.111
(Jud) In the spring we're gonna
be takin' that big tour to England.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.915
- England?
- Over there, you're bigger than Elvis.

57:55.080 --> 57:57.036
Bigger than Elvis?

58:00.240 --> 58:02.913
Say, don't you want JW
to read that over first?

58:03.040 --> 58:04.234
JW?

58:04.360 --> 58:06.316
He's your partner, isn't he?

58:07.800 --> 58:11.679
Well, Mr Phillips,
I've really got to tell you something.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.950
- It's...
- (phone)

58:14.080 --> 58:16.036
Just a second, Jerry.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.394
Yeah.

58:19.520 --> 58:21.476
Hi, Lois.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.633
Uh-huh.

58:27.840 --> 58:29.796
You don't say.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.635
Oh, you don't say.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.910
Yeah. Yeah.

58:37.520 --> 58:41.069
- Our boy just married JW's daughter.
- What?

58:41.200 --> 58:45.113
That's what I was tryin' to say. We've
been holding back from tellin' her folks.

58:45.240 --> 58:47.959
I told you the boy should
have had a place of his own.

58:48.080 --> 58:53.837
It's too late now. The dam has broke loose
and there is all kinds of hell comin' down.

58:53.960 --> 58:57.157
Well, I guess they didn't take it
none too good, did they?

58:57.280 --> 59:00.317
JW is on his way over here now
to shoot your ass full of holes.

59:00.440 --> 59:02.556
- We gotta get this boy outta here.
- I mean it.

59:02.680 --> 59:07.231
And by the way, brother, next time,
let me handle the accommodations.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.713
(horn)

59:17.320 --> 59:19.276
(girls scream)

59:22.760 --> 59:24.716
Shut up!

59:25.800 --> 59:28.109
Come out, you rat bastard!

59:28.240 --> 59:31.994
- Put the gun down. Ain't nobody here.
- Where is that son of a bitch?

59:32.120 --> 59:34.076
- He's gone.
- Bullshit.

59:34.920 --> 59:37.559
Jay, come on in here
and let's talk about this thing.

59:37.680 --> 59:40.558
There ain't a goddamn thing
to talk about, Sam.

59:41.680 --> 59:44.592
I'm gonna kill him. I swear I will kill him.

59:44.720 --> 59:48.633
There are other ways
to handle this thing, man.

59:48.760 --> 59:51.558
Give me the gun.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.634
All right. I'm gonna call the police.

59:54.760 --> 59:58.389
I'll have that little shit charged
with bigamy, incest, kidnapping.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.273
I'll put his ass away for the rest of his life.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.914
Think about it for a second.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.998
You don't know if she's gonna
have a baby or what.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.835
A baby?

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.474
It's happened before.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.634
- Man, she's only 13 years old.
- You know something?

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.070
Who's to say things won't
work out between them?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.317
Man, I've seen this happen
a hundred times before.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.590
Sometimes they'll surprise you.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.396
They may have a good life together.
Maybe not, but...

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.078
you're gonna have to live with
your actions for the rest of your life.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.236
Bye, Daddy.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.276
(both sob)

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.953
It's gonna be OK, Myra.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.036
It's OK.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.996
Hi. Hello, Lois.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.669
Are you mad?

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.234
No, not any more.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.157
Just hurt.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.956
Well, I just want you to know
that I love Myra with all my heart,

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.435
and I'm gonna take real good care of her.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.915
Jerry, she's just a child.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.033
Maybe in years, but not inside
where it counts. And if you're worried...

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.310
Yeah, I'm worried about my little girl.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.749
Well, don't.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.030
Because she's my little girl now.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.633
And I love her, and she loves me.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.276
So I just hope you'll understand.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.951
And I hope that Jay'll understand too
and stay on with the band,

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.833
now that we're makin' all this money.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.755
Come on, baby doll.

# Oh, let him be your teddy bear

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.071
(Myra) That's Graceland.
That's where Elvis lives.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.760
(DJ) It's a sad day
for the women of America.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.793
If you hadn't already heard, Elvis Presley
was inducted into the army today.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.469
Can't help but make a fellow wonder
who'll be the next king of rock and roll.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.556
That's gonna be you. I know it will.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.150
- (man on radio) Goodbye, Elvis.
- And you'll be my queen.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.274
Look, baby doll. Look right there.
Look at that. What is that?

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.359
- Oh! Jerry!
- What's that?

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.995
It's a pink house with a blue door,
that's what that is.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.873
(Myra) Just like my dollhouse!

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.556
- Hi.
- Hello. Go on in.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.995
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.269
Oh!

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.358
So this room is the foyer
and a sunken living room.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.677
Oh, my! The carpets, they come
with the house. So do the curtains.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.715
Look at all the decorative trim. Over here
we have a wall, a whole wall of built-ins.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.277
And the kitchen and the dining room. Over
here the black-and-white linoleum tile.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.836
And the bedrooms.
Yes, you'll want to see those.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.033
(screams)

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.517
Yoo-hoo! Mr Lewis!

(screams)

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.590
- Well, that's one pile. Now the other pile.
- Thanks.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.030
Nine, ten. Be sure you date it.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.677
Now, I want you boys to shake hands
and put your differences behind you.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.838
I just want you to know, Jay,
she ain't pregnant.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.753
I married her because I love her.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.713
Now y'all are gonna be
one big happy family.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.156

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.030
I'm only 13 years old.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.718
Oh.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.308
You're all woman to Jerry Lee, honey.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.152
Here comes the creepy mouse.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.233
# Well, ooh, baby

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.636
# It's crazy

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.758
(Myra moans)

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.033
Ow!

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.879
Yeah.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.353
There.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.673
Where'd you learn to move like that?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.796
I don't know. I just... I felt it in the music.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.673
# Oh, baby, don't be shy

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.314
# This love was meant for you and I

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:44.113
# Wind, rain, sleet or snow

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.832
# I'm gonna be wherever you go

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.518
What?

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.154
What did I do? Did I do it wrong?

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.911
You don't move like no virgin.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.154
(door slams)

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.236
# Breathless

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.590
Take it.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.711
Just go on and take it.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.037
Take the whole thing.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.630
You'll come back, won't you?

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.638
I wonder if I shall.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.912
We must obey the creeds and codes
that we've sworn our lives to.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.873
I know that I must not come back.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.951
And I know that nothing
in this world can keep me away.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.718
(Myra sobs)

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.480
I'm back, baby doll.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.556
Oh, Jerry!

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.193
I don't care what you did before me.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.200
- But, Jerry, I never...
- Sh.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.076
30 shows in six cities in 37 days.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.270
Man, we're gonna make us
a pile of money.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.755
- Yeah.
- Yeah, how much, like, more or less?

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.599
- Well...
- Here he comes.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.473
The next king of rock and roll.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.196
(Jud) Uh-oh.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.751
- Hi, Daddy.
- What in the hell are you doin' here?

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.668
Wherever Jerry Lee Lewis goes,
Myra Gale Lewis goes too.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.396
Uh, Jerry, we've been going all over
the plans for your big tour to England.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.954
- Wanna take a look?
- Ooh, I'm so excited.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.674
- I always wanted to go to England.
- Little lady,

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.555
we don't think it might be such a good
idea if you come along on this trip.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.831
- Why not?
- Well, the folks over there, they...

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.316
they might not understand
about your marriage.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.193
You being so young, and all.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.519
We'll just say she's 15.
That'll be all right, won't it?

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.595
No.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.349
The papers over there are saying you
could be the next king of rock and roll.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.233
- But you gotta act accordingly.
- Yeah.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.750
- It ain't fair. I wanna go.
- You're my daughter, and you ain't goin'

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.916
She's my wife,

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.157
and I say she is goin'

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.316
If Myra ain't goin' I ain't goin' neither.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.193
It's all right, ma'am. She's my wife.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.272
Well, maybe if someone got me a weddin'
ring people wouldn't do us thataway.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.392
- I'm going back to talk to Mama.
- Hey, smell that.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.874
Baby doll, I'm gonna buy you the finest
weddin' ring in all of London, England.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.436
I hate covering arrivals.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.869
I didn't hear you complain
when it was Liberace.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.118
Oh, look here. You're not suggesting
that an artiste of Liberace's stature

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.552
can be likened to the boogie-woogie
of a gum-chewing country bumpkin?

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.636
Well, hello.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:27.193
Look at him, sport! He's the new king
of rock and roll. Mr Lewis! Mr Lewis!

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.834
- Do you intend to record here?
- You stay right there.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.951
Are you gonna meet your British fans?

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.640
How will British youngsters
respond to your music?

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.115
Just point me at a piano
and in 15 minutes

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.028
I'll have 'em shoutin' and a-shakin'
and a-shiverin' and a-shackin'

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.038
What about that long hair
of yours, Mr Lewis?

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.359
Well, my killer wavy blond hair? It's just
so pretty I can't bring myself to cut it.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.631
What cities are you playing in, Mr Lewis?

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.513
How long will you be
touring for, Mr Lewis?

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.231
Excuse me, Miss.
Are you related to Mr Lewis?

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.669
I'm Frankie Jean, Jerry Lee's sister.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.234
Oh, yes. And what about you, Miss?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.749
Um, I'm his wife.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.916
I beg your pardon. I didn't catch that.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.349
I'm Mrs Jerry Lee Lewis.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.032
Mr Lewis.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.789
Is it true that you're married to this... girl?

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.033
(mouths)

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.872
Yes, I am. And proud of it.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.470
This is my little bride, Myra Gale Lewis.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.795
- But she looks so young.
- How old is she?

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.672
Uh, she's 15.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.756
- 15!
- Did he say 15?

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.077
15 years old? Isn't that
a bit young to be a wife?

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.988
Gosh, no. Back home, people get married
at ten. One girl got wed at nine.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.917
- Married at ten?
- Wed at nine?

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.600
- How could you?
- I love her.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.075
But she's only a baby.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.475
(# "Last Night" by the Mar-Keys)

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.075
Hello, Jerry!

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.474
Yesterday, Britons
were shocked to discover

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.673
that visiting American rock-and-roll
star Mr Jerry Lee Lewis

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.234
was married to a 15-year-old girl.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.239
- Looky there! My baby's famous.
- Well, brace yourself, England.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.911
The child bride in question
is 13 years of age,

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.429
and furthermore, she's his cousin.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.313
Second cousin twice removed.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.753
You're on every front page in England.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.360
"Child bride is so young."

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.309
I begged you to keep your big mouth shut.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:45.159
A few pictures of Myra ain't no big deal.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.229
Jerry, this is a big deal.
I mean, will you listen to this guy?

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.593
Let's show Mr Lewis what we think of him
and his baby-snatching ways.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.836
Hell, Mr Phillips, we've got
nothin' to be ashamed of.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.231
(PA) The moment you're waiting for,

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.956
that fabulous rock-and-roll sensation
from the US of A, Jerry Lee Lewis.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.229
(weak applause)

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.113

# I said help, Mr Fireman, please

# You know I'm burnin'
from my head to my knees

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.954
# I'm aflame with such a burnin' desire

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.594
# That little girl sets my soul on fire

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.994
(music stops)

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.035
Y'all don't have to just sit there quiet,
you know. This is a rock-and-roll session.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.277
Y'all can let your hair down.
It'll be all right.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.073
# She's got me burnin' up like a paper cup

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.993
It's awful quiet out there.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.396
I hope y'all aren't as dead
as you sound. I'm alive.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.158
# Turn in a four-alarm

# Oh, little firebug, can't you see?

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.989
# Can't you see
what you're doin' to me?

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.953
# You got me burnin' up like a paper cup

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.312
# I said mm, mm, mm, I'm on fire

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.398
(whistles)

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.351
- Sissy!
- Queer!

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.675
- Put a lid on it.
- Jerry!

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.360
- Cradle robber!
- Baby snatcher!

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.677
- Jerry, just play.
- I got married before God.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.756
- Oh, get out of it!
- Get on your bike!

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:39.350
And what's between me and Myra
is between us and God.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.873
And everybody else can just
mind their own business.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.560
- Go back to America!
- Get off!

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.272

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.754
# When that woman kisses me

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.550
# I start shakin' like a ship on a stormy sea

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.720
# And when I hear her say
"I'm gonna love you each and every day"

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.159
Get lost!

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.800
- How was the concert?
- Great.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.869
Did all those English girls
try to rip your clothes off?

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.918
"Police to act in case of child bride."

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.270
"Home Office to investigate."

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.436
Good morning.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.994
- Investigate what?
- They call you a bigamist.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.079
They found out you weren't divorced from
your second wife when you married Myra.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.997
You mean we ain't married?

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.157
I never was married to my second wife
in the first place.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.874
I already told you
I didn't need to get a divorce.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.275
Yeah. Um, take a look down there.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.313
We're under siege.
They don't want us here.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.633
(doorbell)

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.992
- Hello.
- May we see your passports?

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.918
Uh, yes. Yeah.
Right over here. Just a second.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.189
(phone)

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.232
- Why don't they just go away?
- They're just curious.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.511
They wanna see the new king.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.713
Don't you understand?
They're angry with you because of me.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.796
Don't let that bother you, baby doll.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.957
You're just going to have
to get used to being my queen.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.071
What do you mean? But...

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.668
You gotta give the boy a chance now.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.872
The promoters have cancelled the tour.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.389
The government is tryin' to deport you.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.159
We're washed up here, kids.
We're gettin' out.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.397
Oh, Mama. I wanna go home.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.829
Well, what if I don't wanna go?

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.951
Well, why would you wanna stay?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.833
I promised Myra
I'd buy her a weddin' ring.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:15.033
Well, what do I need a ring for
if we ain't even married?

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.314
- Put him in jail!
- Where's Jerry, then?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.398
- They're coming out!
- Oi, mate! Where's Jerry?

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.834
It's him!

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:35.076
It's Jerry Lee and Myra!

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.156
Come on!

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.708
My God!

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.991
Did I do this? This is all my fault.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.516
I've ruined your career.

You're my wife and I love you,

to prove it if I have to.

- What do you think of your "king" now?
- You're right.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.549
- Elvis Presley is the true king.
- What was that?

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.309
He said Mr Presley is
the true king of rock and roll.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.035
Y'all would have lost the war
without us. You just think about that.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.630
Do you think your expulsion from England
is a repudiation of rock and roll?

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.880
They cancelled Jerry Lee's tour because
of our marriage, not cos of his music.

because of this publicity,

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.031

and we mean to keep it that way.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.199
Jerry, looking ahead, don't you think your
popularity will be diminished at home?

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.437
Back home they take a different view
of this sort of a thing.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.279
I expect a great reception
when I get back there.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.709

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.993
Mr Lewis, do you have
any final words for England?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.229
Yeah.

Serving the Lord for the reward
that waits in heaven.

The other started down the wide street,

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.949
paved with gold,

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:21.110
hypnotising millions of disciples
in the sin that is the devil's music.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.433

Nor walked in his laws!

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.557
Nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.434

become a desolation,

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.313

there is no salvage for him in God.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.837
