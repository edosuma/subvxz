GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

37:37.690 --> 37:38.995
HE'S CAUGHT ON BARBED WIRE.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.258
GRAB THE CAN.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.175
-READY?
-READY.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.013
RUN ME BY HIM!

38:04.891 --> 38:06.980
-I CAN'T GET LOOSE.
-IT'S OKAY.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.069
WE'LL GET YOU OUT. JUST HANG ON.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.766
-I GOT THE WIRE CUTTERS.
-DO IT!

38:24.563 --> 38:25.868
-I THINK MATT'S GOT HIM.
-OKAY.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.438
GET A CHOPPER OUT HERE!

38:30.569 --> 38:31.831
THERE'S ONE ON THE WAY!

38:55.637 --> 38:57.247
HERE'S A PRESENT FOR YOU.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.467
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, LIFEGUARD.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.650
WHAT I SAID ABOUT
BECOMING PART OF THE WAVE,

39:08.781 --> 39:10.391
THIS ISN'T WHAT I MEANT.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.742
IT'S OKAY, MAN. COME ON.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.996
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM MY DESK?

39:53.565 --> 39:55.480
I SUPPOSE THE REAL QUESTION
IS HOW FAR AWAY?

39:56.045 --> 39:58.221
OVER THERE?
OR ON SOME OTHER PLANET?

40:03.662 --> 40:05.664
IS THAT GOING TO BE A LETTER
OF ENDORSEMENT OR REJECTION?

40:05.794 --> 40:07.230
DO YOU MIND?

40:25.161 --> 40:26.206
RUN OUT OF VENOM?

40:38.740 --> 40:40.307
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT YOU READ THIS

40:40.438 --> 40:42.527
BEFORE I SEND IT
TO CHIEF THORPE.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.098
I DON'T WANT TO GET
TO CLOSE TO YOUR DESK.

40:49.229 --> 40:50.709
GO ON. READ IT.
