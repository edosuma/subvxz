00:33.590 --> 00:35.840
Hong Kong, April 2014

00:58.550 --> 01:00.550
It'll get colder.

01:01.550 --> 01:04.300
If you don't want to die, stay close

01:05.300 --> 01:07.370
I know you need the money.
You are all doing this for your family.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.020
Hey.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.300
You're sick?

01:14.600 --> 01:16.800
No. No. Not me. Not me.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.800
I'm okay.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.800
Have a nice trip.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.590
9 Days later, the port of Pyeongtaek.

01:34.720 --> 01:41.470
THE FLU

01:44.470 --> 01:47.090
Bundang, May 1st.

02:00.550 --> 02:02.300
Please move everything aside.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.550
Move it all aside.

02:03.550 --> 02:06.300
Hey, how can you put that thing upside down?
Move it all aside.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.550
It should be placed properly here as well.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.800
And here, there is also the covering..

02:11.300 --> 02:14.550
Jing Ye, you're not here as a supervisor!

02:14.550 --> 02:17.300
I was studying the situation slowly...

02:17.300 --> 02:18.550
Study what?

02:19.550 --> 02:21.550
Hey, the objects over there,

02:21.550 --> 02:23.550
How can no one saw it...

02:23.550 --> 02:24.550
Give me a break ...

02:27.050 --> 02:29.800
Ji Goo, you're going to go down there?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.050
This is very dangerous,

02:32.550 --> 02:34.550
I would rush
to get them out of there.

02:34.550 --> 02:37.050
Today, we will not
have time to rest.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.050
Bring something from there
and come straight back.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.050
Ji Goo, you are going to go down?

02:42.300 --> 02:43.550
Do I have to go down too?

03:00.300 --> 03:01.550
I'm from the Rescue Squad.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.050
Is there anybody there?

03:03.050 --> 03:04.800
Just me alone.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.300
Do not worry.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.300
Sir, help me...

03:16.300 --> 03:17.550
Mr. Rescue Squad staff,

03:17.550 --> 03:19.300
Quickly help me..

03:19.300 --> 03:20.800
Sir, save me.

03:21.550 --> 03:22.550
Don't worry.

03:23.050 --> 03:24.300
What should I do...

03:25.300 --> 03:26.800
I will save you.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.050
If you get too excited,

03:30.050 --> 03:30.800
This lever tool plus your gossip

03:30.800 --> 03:32.050
would be very dangerous...

03:32.050 --> 03:33.800
What, what, ahhh...

03:44.550 --> 03:48.300
I'm not going to fall right...

03:50.050 --> 03:51.300
Of course you're not going to fall,

03:53.050 --> 03:54.050
From now on ...

03:54.050 --> 03:55.050
Look at my eyes,

03:55.050 --> 03:56.050
Don't look elsewhere..

03:56.050 --> 03:56.800
um, um

03:56.800 --> 03:57.800
Just look at my eyes.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.550
Good.

03:58.550 --> 03:59.800
Now I'll carry you out,

04:01.050 --> 04:02.300
Wait, wait.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.300
I have to open this part first,

04:04.550 --> 04:05.300
Let me do it first..

04:05.300 --> 04:07.050
The seat belt must be removed first.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.050
Well now,

04:09.050 --> 04:09.550
Don't move first...

04:09.800 --> 04:11.050
ah

04:12.300 --> 04:13.800
Don't worry,

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
Sorry ...

04:14.800 --> 04:16.300
I have to hold your bottoms.

04:17.550 --> 04:18.550
Now... now...

04:18.550 --> 04:19.800
We have to get out of here.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.800
1.. 2.. 3..

04:23.300 --> 04:24.800
Your skirt is caught in the seat...

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
I would slowly pull it.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.250
One ...

04:31.050 --> 04:32.300
My skirt...

04:32.300 --> 04:33.550
Sir, you really...

04:33.550 --> 04:35.050
Skirt is not so important at this time.

04:35.050 --> 04:35.800
Come on we have to get out ...

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
No...

04:37.050 --> 04:38.050
Now is not the time...

04:38.050 --> 04:39.300
Give me a break...

04:40.800 --> 04:42.050
If so, wear this.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.050
Give it to me.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.550
Damn.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.300
This guy is really ..

04:51.050 --> 04:52.050
Sir.. sir..

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
Ji Goo ...

05:01.800 --> 05:03.050
Are you okay?

05:04.050 --> 05:05.050
Ji Goo ... Ji Goo ..

05:05.050 --> 05:06.550
Are you okay?

05:07.050 --> 05:09.300
Ji Goo ...
Are you alright?

05:09.300 --> 05:10.550
She has been successfully saved.

05:10.550 --> 05:11.550
Yeah.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.050
Now pull us up.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.050
Don't worry.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.300
I was very anxious.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.050
We were very worried about you ...

05:22.050 --> 05:23.800
while going down there,
Initially everything went well

05:23.800 --> 05:25.300
The rope moves, then ...

05:25.300 --> 05:26.050
Yes .. yes ..

05:26.050 --> 05:27.050
I understand how you feel ...

05:27.050 --> 05:28.300
You must remember

05:28.300 --> 05:29.550
Ji Goo

05:30.300 --> 05:31.800
I have checked,

05:31.800 --> 05:32.800
I'm the victim here,

05:32.800 --> 05:33.550
What's your KTP number?

05:33.550 --> 05:35.300
Didn't I told you just now?

05:35.300 --> 05:37.800
Ahh I had fill it in.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.550
Thus,

05:38.550 --> 05:40.300
at the junction,

05:40.300 --> 05:42.300
I just go straight
It was a sudden car accident

05:42.300 --> 05:45.800
We can confirm your statement through
the traffic cctv video footage.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
- Later we'll contact you back.
- It's not like that

05:46.800 --> 05:48.300
Sir .. sir ..

05:49.550 --> 05:50.550
Ugh...

05:50.550 --> 05:52.050
It's okay?

05:52.550 --> 05:53.800
Drink this coffee drink.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.800
You are Kim In Hei, right?

05:55.800 --> 05:59.050
I do things like this every day,

05:59.050 --> 06:01.300
But this is the first time
someone sitting next to me,

06:01.300 --> 06:03.550
After almost dying.

06:03.550 --> 06:05.300
Don't worry.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.050
Believe in us as a rescue team.

06:08.050 --> 06:09.050
Do not talk too much ...

06:09.050 --> 06:10.300
All this is your job.

06:12.550 --> 06:13.550
Err .. Yes ...

06:13.550 --> 06:15.550
Ahh .. Don't bother her.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.800
Leaving without saying anything?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.300
At least, just say thank you.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.050
Make us look any useful.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.800
She didn't say anything
so what should I do ...

06:26.800 --> 06:27.550
You ..

06:27.550 --> 06:29.050
Why didn't you ask ...

06:29.800 --> 06:31.300
Hey .. hey .. you..

06:31.300 --> 06:32.550
Yeah, you're attracted ...

06:32.550 --> 06:34.550
You saw her?

06:34.550 --> 06:36.800
Mmm kind of sweet.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.550
Yes, very pretty,

06:38.550 --> 06:39.800
The moment she looked at me ..

06:39.800 --> 06:44.050
With her eyes ...

06:44.050 --> 06:45.550
I'm really regret...

06:45.550 --> 06:46.550
You did not say anything to her?

06:46.550 --> 06:47.550
How could I do it.

06:47.550 --> 06:48.550
I'm embarrassed ...

06:48.550 --> 06:50.300
You should have said something ...

06:50.300 --> 06:52.050
However, she was
wearing my jacket

06:52.050 --> 06:53.300
That's true ...

06:53.300 --> 06:54.050
So why however?

06:54.050 --> 06:55.550
If you borrow clothes from others,
What would you do?

06:55.800 --> 06:56.550
What else ...

06:56.550 --> 06:57.300
I definitely come back again
after a while,

06:57.300 --> 06:58.300
with clothes that are clean.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.800
She definitely must come back.

07:01.050 --> 07:03.050
Of course she will come back and say,

07:03.050 --> 07:05.800
- Oops
- Thank you

07:05.800 --> 07:07.300
Much obliged. Thank you very much.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.050
At that time,
and in such circumstances

07:09.050 --> 07:11.500
I did not say thank you.

07:11.550 --> 07:12.550
Then I'll say,

07:12.550 --> 07:14.300
ah yeah, who are you?

07:14.300 --> 07:16.300
You did well.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.800
Hey Ji Goo!

07:17.820 --> 07:19.790
Yes!

07:19.800 --> 07:21.050
Some people are looking for you.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.300
Who?

07:22.800 --> 07:25.300
Look like the woman you save.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.800
That woman.

07:29.050 --> 07:30.400
Yeah!

07:34.550 --> 07:35.550
Where's he going?

07:37.050 --> 07:38.050
You've got a call.

07:39.550 --> 07:40.300
I love you.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.550
What the fuck ...

07:44.050 --> 07:46.050
Please help me find my hand bag.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.800
At least help me to wash it.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.050
Oh.. oh.. sorry.

07:51.550 --> 07:52.800
I'm too busy.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.050
Sorry.

07:54.050 --> 07:54.650
Oh, It's okay.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.100
So your excuse to meet me
is only to find your hand bag,

07:57.800 --> 08:00.300
Yeah, ahh.. I've ask others
but they all said no.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.050
Of course they refused,
what if they don't manage to find it.

08:02.050 --> 08:02.800
but, really ...

08:02.800 --> 08:05.550
The information inside the car
is very important to me

08:05.550 --> 08:08.050
What if you do it
as a personal task.

08:08.050 --> 08:10.800
I will never undertakes
a mission for just a person.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.050
Look...

08:12.050 --> 08:14.550
This place has been sealed.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.050
And the rescue team task

08:17.050 --> 08:20.550
is not to look for something
but to save lives.

08:20.550 --> 08:21.800
What do you mean?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.300
On TV, it's said you will assist
in finding cats and dogs.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.550
It's not the same thing.

08:34.300 --> 08:35.050
Yes, I understand.

08:35.050 --> 08:35.800
Where are you going?

08:37.550 --> 08:38.800
It's dangerous there,

08:38.800 --> 08:40.550
Don't mind me.

08:40.550 --> 08:42.050
After all that I did,
why are you like this?

08:42.050 --> 08:44.050
I'm trying to take care of you
in order not to do ...

08:44.550 --> 08:45.550
So you're not going to go there, right?

08:48.050 --> 08:49.050
Are you okay?

08:49.050 --> 08:50.050
Let me see.

08:53.050 --> 08:54.800
Do not push me .. ahh ...

08:54.800 --> 08:56.050
Sorry.

08:56.550 --> 08:58.050
You're hurt,

08:58.550 --> 09:00.050
See, I told you.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.550
It's very dangerous.

09:02.050 --> 09:02.800
ah

09:03.550 --> 09:05.550
Besides, I don't know
what is in the bag.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.050
Whether it's still intact or not.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.300
Please go.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
Can you stand up?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.050
I'm really easy to be fooled.
Usually I'm the one injured.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.800
How can someone ...
Who doesn't want help act like this.

09:22.550 --> 09:24.550
Very excited to meet me
and then go off in anger.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.050
Quickly.

09:39.050 --> 09:41.050
How much longer?

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Do not let us get in trouble.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
How much longer?

09:43.800 --> 09:44.800
Ah, damn it.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Damn it.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.300
Don't be quick to get angry.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.800
Do it one more time.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.550
If the transaction is successful,

09:51.550 --> 09:56.550
I'll buy you something,
Michael Jordan Collection..

09:56.550 --> 09:57.550
Really?

09:57.550 --> 09:59.050
Of course, when did I ever fool you.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.050
Hold it.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.300
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

10:08.550 --> 10:09.300
Ouch ...

10:09.550 --> 10:10.550
This is their waste.

10:10.550 --> 10:11.300
It smells ...

10:11.300 --> 10:12.050
Silent.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.300
It smells very bad.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.050
Oh, it got on my shoes.

10:15.550 --> 10:17.300
I said quiet.

10:18.050 --> 10:18.800
Damn it.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.300
Alright.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.050
Hello, everybody stand up!

10:23.550 --> 10:27.300
These shoes are quite expensive.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.300
Silent.

10:38.050 --> 10:39.800
Come, come with us.

10:43.550 --> 10:44.800
What is this ...

10:45.550 --> 10:46.800
Get some light.

10:58.050 --> 10:59.300
Damn it, all of them are dead.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.300
Shine downward ...

11:03.550 --> 11:04.550
Can't be trusted.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.050
How did it turn out this way?
Damn it.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.800
release my hand.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
ah, damn it.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.050
Release it.

11:14.050 --> 11:15.550
Release me, you fucking idiot.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.550
Please help me.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.050
Hey idiot,
only you survived?

11:27.050 --> 11:29.050
Please save me.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.550
The others are dead.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.300
Say something ...

11:33.050 --> 11:34.800
The shit just hit me in the face..

11:35.050 --> 11:36.300
This is really crazy

11:37.050 --> 11:38.050
Watch him...

11:38.050 --> 11:39.050
ah ah ah ah

11:40.050 --> 11:41.300
I have to take my hand phone.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.550
Don't forget to wear your mask.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.050
May 2nd.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.050
How can that be?
May 2nd.

11:58.050 --> 11:58.470
May 2nd.

11:59.550 --> 12:00.800
How can it end like this?

12:01.550 --> 12:02.550
Nonsense.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.050
I'm just a courier,

12:07.050 --> 12:08.300
However...

12:09.550 --> 12:10.300
Now there is one person who survived.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.300
The transaction still have to go on.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.550
You can not possibly not know!

12:13.550 --> 12:14.550
Why are you doing this to me?

12:15.550 --> 12:17.050
Ah.. really unlucky.

12:18.050 --> 12:19.050
Hello!

12:21.800 --> 12:23.050
Hello, wait a minute.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.550
There are police,
Let's go.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.300
Let's get going.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.300
I'm unwell.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Fucking idiot.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.300
Ah..damn it.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.050
Didn't you see it?

12:54.050 --> 12:55.300
Sorry.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
Where did he go?

13:40.050 --> 13:41.050
You have severe flu.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.550
You need a lot of rest.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.550
I'll give you some medications.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.050
Wow.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.300
Mom.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.800
Fucker, really?

14:21.300 --> 14:22.550
I understand, I understand,

14:22.550 --> 14:23.800
I said, I understand.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.050
I'll catch him.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.050
I'll catch him soon.

14:30.550 --> 14:31.550
Let's go.

14:33.050 --> 14:37.050
Your dissertation data is lost?

14:37.550 --> 14:39.050
Yes, I'm sorry.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.300
There's no time left.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.550
Dr. Kim will not be in charge
anymore, someone else will replace her.

14:43.550 --> 14:47.050
But now, there's not much we can do.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.300
I'm sorry,

14:48.300 --> 14:49.300
about that,

14:49.300 --> 14:51.800
I will work harder
at the end of this semester.

14:51.800 --> 14:52.800
Sorry,

15:01.800 --> 15:04.550
At least don't involve others.

15:08.550 --> 15:10.300
That woman really sucks.

15:11.550 --> 15:13.550
If we get caught ...

15:13.550 --> 15:15.300
It was your idea to help her,

15:15.300 --> 15:17.300
You forced me
to do all this.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.300
Understand.

15:19.050 --> 15:22.300
Elder brother ...

15:22.550 --> 15:25.300
You said, you know a lot about women.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.550
You also do
dangerous things for them.

15:28.550 --> 15:30.050
This is also work for the public.

15:30.050 --> 15:31.300
It's official.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.050
I will file a complaint.

15:33.050 --> 15:36.550
I didn't really mean it.

15:36.550 --> 15:37.800
Elder brother ...

15:38.300 --> 15:39.550
Please don't touch her things.

15:39.550 --> 15:41.050
Do you like it when someone else
touching your things?

15:41.050 --> 15:42.800
Of course not.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.050
But you can do it politely.

15:45.050 --> 15:46.300
Just because you do it politely,

15:46.300 --> 15:47.800
so it's up to you if you go
through other people's hand bags.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.550
Hey,

15:48.550 --> 15:49.550
You're too polite.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.050
What if
this is not that woman's hand bag?

15:51.050 --> 15:51.800
Well, what?

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
This is too much.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.550
But I'm already too tired
I want to take a break.

15:54.550 --> 15:55.550
Tired, tired.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.550
If so

15:56.550 --> 15:58.300
why Tung Su run off
with another man

15:58.300 --> 16:01.550
Don't talk about Tung Su.

16:01.550 --> 16:02.800
What is this ...

16:06.050 --> 16:06.800
She's a doctor.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.050
Who's calling.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.300
Hey man politely answer the phone.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.050
The phone still vibrates.

16:11.050 --> 16:12.050
Don't answer, don't answer.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.050
I already answered.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.550
Talk ...

16:17.050 --> 16:18.550
Hello.

16:18.550 --> 16:19.800
Uncle, who are you?

16:19.800 --> 16:22.050
Why answer my mom's phone?

16:22.050 --> 16:23.050
Mom?

16:28.550 --> 16:30.800
Why uncle take so long?

16:30.800 --> 16:31.800
I have to go home quickly.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.300
Now, because of uncle
I will be home late.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.300
Traffic jam.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.300
Sorry.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.800
Who are you uncle?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.750
What do you do?

16:43.800 --> 16:44.550
My name?

16:44.550 --> 16:50.050
My mother told me not to talk
with people we do not know

16:50.050 --> 16:51.300
Really?

16:52.050 --> 16:54.050
I'm Kang Ji goo.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.550
I'm from the rescue team.

16:59.050 --> 17:00.300
Look at this,

17:01.300 --> 17:02.300
Read it,

17:02.300 --> 17:03.300
It's correct?.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.300
Rescue team staff.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.300
I don't understand the writing.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.300
I'm really a member of the rescue team.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.550
What is the rescuer team's task?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.800
Helping people
in a dangerous situation.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.550
This includes doctors too?

17:18.550 --> 17:22.550
We are stronger than the doctor.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.550
Doctors can only
help people in the hospital.

17:24.550 --> 17:26.550
I'm the one who deliver
those people there.

17:26.550 --> 17:27.300
And doctors do it

17:27.300 --> 17:28.550
To get the money,

17:28.800 --> 17:31.550
we do so voluntarily.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.550
You understand it, voluntarily.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.550
Give me my mom's hand bag.

17:37.050 --> 17:39.050
How do I know you're really her daughter?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.050
Your mom is always like that
when she sleeps?

17:49.800 --> 17:51.300
Your mother's really unique.

17:52.550 --> 17:53.550
Enough is enough.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.550
Give me her bag.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.150
All right, take it.

17:58.550 --> 18:00.050
Are you going?

18:02.050 --> 18:04.300
Uncle, give me your name card.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.050
Maybe there is something missing,

18:06.050 --> 18:08.550
We need to call you.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.050
Alright.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.550
Here, take it.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.800
I'll take you home.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.550
No need,

18:18.550 --> 18:21.300
My mom told me not to go in
other people's cars.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.800
My teacher is going to take me home.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.050
Don't worry

18:26.050 --> 18:28.800
By the way
Thank you.

18:31.550 --> 18:32.800
She is really her daughter.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.050
That's really her child.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.800
It's not an exaggeration.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.550
But she and her daughter are very similar.

18:39.550 --> 18:40.550
ha ha ha

18:40.550 --> 18:42.300
She's a married woman

18:42.300 --> 18:43.800
So it is in vain then ...

18:46.800 --> 18:48.800
Yes, I'm on the way home.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.300
Class!

19:03.300 --> 19:04.800
Class monitor.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.300
You ate something wrongly?

19:13.550 --> 19:14.800
Children...

19:14.800 --> 19:16.050
It's time to eat snacks.

19:21.050 --> 19:21.800
What is it?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.750
Are you okay?

19:32.550 --> 19:33.550
Not here.

19:49.550 --> 19:50.800
Why?

19:54.300 --> 19:56.300
- Why are you so late?
- Sorry I'm late.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.050
I'm sorry ...
I'm sorry ...

19:58.050 --> 19:58.800
Thank you.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.800
Mom.

20:01.050 --> 20:02.300
Did you do what the nanny tells you aunt?

20:03.550 --> 20:04.800
Like it?

20:05.300 --> 20:07.050
Ohh ...

20:11.800 --> 20:13.800
Finally I found it.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.800
Thank you dear.

20:15.050 --> 20:15.800
Thank you, my sweet Mi Reu.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.550
I love you dear.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.550
You know, mom finds it very difficult to find.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.800
Uncle from the rescue team
help to find mom's handbag.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.050
And I did not go in his car.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.300
If there's something missing
from  mom's handbag,

20:33.300 --> 20:35.050
Just call the uncle.

20:35.050 --> 20:37.800
I told him
to provide his contacts,

20:37.800 --> 20:40.800
So that he could be responsible later.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.300
We don't really know
the person.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.300
Ohh my dear.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.300
My dear Kim Mi Reu.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.050
Of course, I'm mom's daughter.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.300
I'm incredible, right?

20:49.300 --> 20:51.300
Say thanks to me.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.300
Say thank you very much.
Thank you very much dear.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.800
Because you live for mom.

20:56.550 --> 20:57.800
What should mom buy for you?

20:57.800 --> 20:58.550
I ...

20:59.550 --> 21:01.800
want a cat.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.800
Mother had already said, the one
thing you can't have is a cat.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.650
Ohh ...
Ohh ...

21:06.050 --> 21:07.800
Cannot keep a cat.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.550
The cat's leg is injured.

21:12.550 --> 21:14.300
It cannot be adopted.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.800
No one wants it.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.550
It need someone to take care of it.

21:17.550 --> 21:21.050
Is acupuncture treatment enough?

21:21.050 --> 21:22.550
That's okay, right?

21:24.800 --> 21:28.050
Mom will make you, your favorite food.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.550
At that time he talks nonsense.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.550
Why not help me from the beginning.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.550
Now in fact he goes alone
to find it.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.050
Mom, telephone call.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.050
Oh, I've found the USB thumbdrive.

21:43.050 --> 21:44.550
Doctor, there is an emergency.

21:44.550 --> 21:45.800
You need to come here.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
Virus attack?

21:46.800 --> 21:48.050
the body temperature
is more than 40 degrees.

21:48.050 --> 21:50.050
the man is being isolated.

21:50.050 --> 21:51.300
But we do not know the cause.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.050
All right, I understand.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.050
I'll be right there.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
That's all right.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.550
Go mom, for my sake.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.300
But, what about your dinner?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.800
I can feed myself.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.050
It's an emergency,

22:23.550 --> 22:25.550
Right now I can't get the nanny.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.800
Mom, just help me this time.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.050
I don't always ask for mom's help.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.050
Only this time only.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.800
Dr. Kim. Here.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.300
Mom must help me to take care of Mi Reu.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.300
You should,

22:39.300 --> 22:40.050
I have to hang up.

22:41.050 --> 22:42.550
Isolation area.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.050
Is he vomiting blood?

22:44.050 --> 22:45.300
Has he been injected with antibiotics?

22:45.300 --> 22:47.550
Blood poisoning can lead to coma.

22:47.550 --> 22:49.550
With anti-hypertensive drugs
we couldn't control his blood pressure.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.800
We have to examine his internal organs.

22:59.050 --> 23:01.050
Have you've checked
where he ever traveled?

23:01.050 --> 23:02.300
We haven't check.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.550
Doctor, this.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.050
I need time,
I will inject this drug first.

23:07.070 --> 23:07.970
okay.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.300
Is that the patient's belongings?

23:11.300 --> 23:12.050
Ah, yeah right.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.550
Professor.

23:17.550 --> 23:18.800
How's the patient's condition at this time?

23:19.550 --> 23:20.800
This is the patient recording.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.050
View this recording.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.550
There's a possibility of infection from
the container.

23:25.550 --> 23:27.050
Based on this video,

23:27.050 --> 23:30.050
there's a possibility he is attacked
by some sort of bird flu virus.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.800
What are you saying?

23:32.800 --> 23:35.550
Our country is attacked by bird flu virus?

23:38.300 --> 23:40.050
Are you the family of the patient?

23:41.050 --> 23:42.300
Yeah, something like that.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.050
Have you seen the video in his hand phone?

23:44.050 --> 23:45.800
What happens inside the container?

23:49.300 --> 23:50.050
I do not understand what you mean.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.300
We do not know the cause of his sickness...

23:53.800 --> 23:55.050
but for the moment he seems
to be infected with bird flu virus.

23:55.050 --> 23:55.800
To make sure it's really is a virus,

23:55.800 --> 23:56.800
So I think you'll understand.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.550
What virus?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.050
Like a computer virus?

24:00.550 --> 24:02.800
He always drank cough medicine.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.050
Where's the container?

24:06.050 --> 24:06.800
Where is he?

24:06.800 --> 24:07.050
No need,

24:07.050 --> 24:07.800
He isolated at this time.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.050
Damn it.

24:11.050 --> 24:11.800
I have to meet my younger brother.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.300
Why are you guys ...

24:12.300 --> 24:13.800
standing in my way?

24:14.300 --> 24:15.800
Emergency conditions ....
Emergency conditions ....

24:15.800 --> 24:17.050
Immediately proceed to the isolation room.

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
Emergency conditions ....
Emergency conditions ....

24:19.300 --> 24:20.550
You cannot go there.

24:20.550 --> 24:21.550
Move over guys.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.050
You may be infected as well.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.550
Catch ... catch him.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.300
Byeong Woo ...

24:41.300 --> 24:41.800
You may not enter.

24:41.800 --> 24:42.800
Byeong Woo ...

24:44.300 --> 24:45.300
Byeong Woo ...

24:45.300 --> 24:46.300
You must not hold him,

24:56.050 --> 24:57.300
Don't, let go.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.300
Come on,

25:02.050 --> 25:04.300
Quickly, take him out of here.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.300
Hold him fast.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.550
Byeong Woo ...

25:20.550 --> 25:21.550
Kitty.

25:22.300 --> 25:23.550
Kitty.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.050
Where are you?

25:26.050 --> 25:29.050
Kitty, I came,

25:29.050 --> 25:32.300
I brought a lots of yummy food.

25:33.300 --> 25:38.050
Miow ...miow..

25:42.050 --> 25:43.800
Kitty.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.800
Damn it.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.300
Be careful when walking.

26:01.300 --> 26:02.300
Damn it.

26:10.550 --> 26:13.550
Are you sick?

26:14.300 --> 26:16.550
I'm sick, don't come closer.

26:16.550 --> 26:19.300
Or you'll be in danger.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.550
Go there.

26:42.050 --> 26:43.300
Don't come close.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.050
Call me Mi Reu.

26:47.050 --> 26:49.300
Why do you keep following me?

26:50.050 --> 26:51.800
Go home to your house now.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.550
Go on, go home, go home.

26:55.300 --> 26:59.050
I said, call me Mi Reu.

27:00.550 --> 27:01.800
Mi Reu.

27:02.550 --> 27:03.800
Mi Reu.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.550
Your name's Mi Reu.

27:08.570 --> 27:10.070
I'm Moon Sai.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
My name is Moon sai.

27:13.050 --> 27:15.550
Ahh ... Moon sai.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.300
Oh, thank you.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.800
You're a good girl.

27:22.800 --> 27:28.300
Looking at you, I remember my sister.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.050
Moon sai ...

27:37.050 --> 27:39.050
You're sick ...

27:40.550 --> 27:41.800
Moon sai,

27:42.550 --> 27:44.300
I will find someone to help.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.300
Moon sai

27:45.300 --> 27:46.550
You must hold on.

27:46.550 --> 27:47.550
You have to wait for me, understand.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.050
Wait for me.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.300
Come on my little friend, come out.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.300
How can I reach it?

27:56.300 --> 27:58.550
Don't give your heart to a beautiful woman.

27:58.550 --> 27:59.550
Come on out little fella.

27:59.550 --> 28:01.300
It's hard to live.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.550
There's a wonderful place, yes?

28:04.050 --> 28:05.050
You really don't remember?

28:05.050 --> 28:06.300
I really don't remember.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.200
Come on, come out,

28:07.220 --> 28:09.220
Stop it,

28:10.800 --> 28:11.800
Ah, contact.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.800
Oh Mi Ki.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.300
Did you suffer?

28:14.300 --> 28:15.550
How is it there?

28:15.550 --> 28:18.550
Mommy is sorry,

28:18.800 --> 28:20.300
Ah, it's funny.

28:21.550 --> 28:22.550
Really funny.

28:23.050 --> 28:24.300
Sir.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.550
Rescuing dog is not with the mouth.

28:28.050 --> 28:29.300
This is very disturbing.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.050
When there's call to 119,

28:30.050 --> 28:31.800
We instead end up helping a puppy.

28:32.300 --> 28:34.800
There must be an error in the system.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.420
Hello.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.550
Who?

28:39.800 --> 28:40.800
This photo,

28:40.800 --> 28:42.050
This is a photo of a bird flu patient
in vietnam last year.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.300
His face was red.

28:43.550 --> 28:45.050
Look at the photos of the patient Byeong Woo,

28:45.050 --> 28:48.550
The situation is very different.

28:48.550 --> 28:50.550
Strangely both are similar.

28:50.550 --> 28:53.300
But the spread is not as fast as this.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.300
Perhaps the patient is already sick before this,

28:56.550 --> 28:58.500
Do you have any infected patients in
addition to the patient's in this hospital?

28:58.550 --> 28:59.800
None yet.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.050
Judging from the rate of death with the
number of patients, what could it be? ...

29:02.050 --> 29:04.800
This should be handled by the
Disease Operations Center in our country.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.300
This's the best way.

29:06.300 --> 29:07.300
Doctor!

29:07.300 --> 29:08.800
There are some patients
with the same condition.

29:09.800 --> 29:10.800
Make way ... make way ...

29:11.300 --> 29:12.800
Out of the way... out of the way...

29:16.550 --> 29:17.800
Director,

29:18.050 --> 29:19.550
There is a call from the police,

29:19.550 --> 29:20.800
they have found the container.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.800
Doctor,

29:21.800 --> 29:22.800
This patient's condition is also the same.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.300
Make way ....

29:25.050 --> 29:26.300
Take emergency precautions immediately.

29:53.550 --> 29:55.050
Where is he ...

29:55.550 --> 29:57.050
Moon Sai is sick.

29:57.050 --> 29:58.050
Mi Reu, uncle should go.

29:58.050 --> 30:00.300
Uncle have to go back to work.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.050
Moon Sai ... Moon Sai ...

30:01.050 --> 30:02.300
Uncle should go now.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.800
Moon Sai ...

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
- How can a child loses a "Moon Sai"
- Moon Sai

30:05.800 --> 30:06.800
This child ...

30:07.550 --> 30:08.300
Moon Sai ...

30:08.300 --> 30:09.550
Tell uncle, your mom's phone number,

30:09.550 --> 30:10.550
Mom's phone number,

30:10.800 --> 30:11.800
Tell me...

30:11.800 --> 30:12.800
Why?

30:12.800 --> 30:16.550
I can't give my mom's phone number.

30:16.550 --> 30:18.550
I called uncle to find Moon Sai.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.800
Is not that, Mi Reu.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.050
Your mom is very busy.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.300
Uncle is also very busy.

30:23.550 --> 30:25.800
Quickly find Moon Sai.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.550
You should not disturbs uncle like this.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.800
Moon Sai.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
Uncle go first.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.550
Understand.

30:36.550 --> 30:39.300
Sleepy ... sleepy ...

30:44.800 --> 30:45.550
Gosh ....

30:45.550 --> 30:48.300
- Moon Sai ...
- Moon Sai , Moon Sai

30:48.800 --> 30:51.300
Uncle, why don't you look seriously for him.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.050
Yes, I understand,

30:52.050 --> 30:55.300
- Moon Sai ...
- Moon Sai

30:55.300 --> 30:57.050
Where are you Moon sai ...

31:14.050 --> 31:15.300
This is enough,

31:15.300 --> 31:16.300
Quickly take the picture.

31:16.300 --> 31:17.550
Quickly close the door.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.050
We have not found
the source of the disease,

31:42.050 --> 31:46.050
At this time it would be very difficult
to conclude the cause.

31:47.550 --> 31:50.050
However, based on the current situation.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.800
It can be concluded that
this is an infectious virus.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.050
I thought that animal's viruses
cannot infect humans?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.050
WH5, now can infect humans

31:57.050 --> 32:00.050
H5 from...

32:00.050 --> 32:00.800
I'm talking,

32:00.800 --> 32:02.050
Why do you interrupts me?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.550
I mean,

32:03.550 --> 32:05.050
Don't interrupts me.

32:05.050 --> 32:08.800
What I want to say is that
we're all infected and can die.

32:08.800 --> 32:12.800
Although only those infected for
more than 60 hours are going to die.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.300
Mr. Mayor.

32:16.550 --> 32:17.550
The time of death of the infected patients

32:17.550 --> 32:19.300
is rapidly diminishing.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.800
Wait.

32:24.300 --> 32:28.300
This is Bundang's Mayor, Mr. Mayor.

32:28.300 --> 32:29.050
Stop, stop.

32:29.050 --> 32:30.550
He has not finish.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.300
What conclusions do you want to say earlier.

32:33.300 --> 32:37.050
It's a disease pandemic

32:37.800 --> 32:39.050
What is "Pandemic"?

32:39.050 --> 32:41.050
Please interrupts everything,

32:41.050 --> 32:42.300
You don't speak clearly.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.300
Try to explain so that it's
more easily understood.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.300
Describe the core of what you said earlier.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.800
Like for example, if the virus spreads ...

32:48.800 --> 32:52.050
will have a major impact.

32:52.050 --> 32:54.050
Is that the point?

32:55.300 --> 32:56.300
Soon ...

32:57.800 --> 32:59.300
Scorched earth Bundang

33:00.050 --> 33:01.300
Scorch the earth?

33:03.300 --> 33:06.050
"Across the Pacific Ocean ... "

33:06.050 --> 33:10.050
"What a very pleasant
helped keep the boy .. "

33:10.050 --> 33:11.050
Geez ...

33:11.050 --> 33:13.050
Yes it's fun, very fun.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.550
It's like a dream come true.

33:14.550 --> 33:16.300
"Looking better ...
World for the better ...  "

33:16.300 --> 33:17.300
Then, I hang up.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.550
Yes hang up,
so that the child stopped singing.

33:18.550 --> 33:19.550
She's very noisy.

33:20.050 --> 33:24.050
"The fact that we have to deal ... "

33:26.050 --> 33:27.800
There's one thing ...

33:27.800 --> 33:30.300
Uncle's lunch with me ...

33:30.300 --> 33:31.550
The must be kept a secret from mom...

33:31.550 --> 33:32.800
Understand.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.550
Uncle will not mention this to your mother.

33:34.550 --> 33:37.300
Mi Reu, uncle have to go back on duty.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.300
Even if Uncle should not know
mom's phone number,

33:38.300 --> 33:39.800
But uncle show know your dad's
phone number.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.050
What's the number?

33:41.050 --> 33:43.050
Dad has not returned.

33:43.050 --> 33:44.800
Mom would cry.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
Why's mom crying?

33:45.800 --> 33:48.550
Mom cried every day.

33:48.550 --> 33:51.800
I also cry sometime.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.550
Mi Reu not live with dad?

33:54.550 --> 33:56.800
Dad's in America.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.550
And he left Mi Reu with mom.

34:01.550 --> 34:02.800
ha .. ha .. ha ..

34:02.800 --> 34:05.050
It's  outrageous ...

34:05.050 --> 34:06.800
He left behind his pretty daughter.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.550
Stop it.

34:08.550 --> 34:09.800
Because my dad left me,

34:09.800 --> 34:12.800
I couldn't go during the
school's opening ceremony.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.300
Uncle, you don't know anything.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.300
Uncle understand.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.800
Uncle didn't eat his food.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
Geez no, Mi Reu want it?

34:28.800 --> 34:29.800
Want it?

34:29.800 --> 34:30.550
No.

34:30.550 --> 34:31.800
I want to give it to Moon Sai.

34:32.550 --> 34:33.550
The "Moon Sai" again.

34:34.050 --> 34:35.550
Moon Sai ... Moon Sai ...

34:37.800 --> 34:38.300
Uncle,

34:38.300 --> 34:40.300
Help me, to put on my hair band.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.050
Geez ...

34:43.050 --> 34:44.800
I never had someone to take care off.

34:44.800 --> 34:45.800
Here.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.800
Good.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.550
It's beautiful.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.050
Uncle, buy me another glass of
strawberry smoothie.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.300
Mi Reu, you have a cold?

34:58.050 --> 35:00.050
If you have a cold,
you should not drink cold drinks.

35:00.050 --> 35:03.300
But I want to drink it.

35:04.550 --> 35:06.800
Your order,  a strawberry smoothie

35:24.800 --> 35:27.050
Bundang is an urban area.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.300
In Bundang at the least, there
are approximately 460,000 people.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.800
What?

35:31.800 --> 35:33.300
Scorch the earth?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.800
This area is only 15km from Seoul.

35:38.550 --> 35:40.300
Here, is like Seoul.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.300
How many international standard events
are held here each year

35:45.050 --> 35:46.800
How can you make such an irresponsible statment.

35:47.550 --> 35:49.800
What can you do?

35:50.300 --> 35:51.300
Mr. Mayor.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.800
If it is true, this case is due
to some sort of virus,

35:54.050 --> 35:56.300
We will lose
more than we can imagine.

35:57.550 --> 36:00.800
You're so afraid of a new virus,

36:00.800 --> 36:03.800
But you said it as if,
we are like the cats and dogs.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.050
Mr. Mayor.

36:05.050 --> 36:06.300
Let's leave first.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.300
There is another meeting you need to attend.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.800
We are holding a meeting now, what else?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.550
Now the disease is spreading ...

36:11.550 --> 36:14.050
We will ask the more experienced ...

36:14.050 --> 36:16.050
Come on everyone,
we have 30 minutes to eat.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.300
Time is running out ...

36:19.050 --> 36:20.300
Eat as fast as possible.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.300
Professor.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.800
In the container there was a survivor.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.050
There's a survivor?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.550
Oh Brother,

36:39.550 --> 36:40.550
Did you get my message?

36:40.550 --> 36:41.800
I've given instructions as well.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.550
The child fell asleep.

37:03.550 --> 37:04.800
It's really crazy.

37:05.550 --> 37:06.550
I'll call you again.

37:30.050 --> 37:31.300
Are you okay?

37:44.050 --> 37:45.300
Shine downward ...

37:48.050 --> 37:49.300
Hold.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.050
The container containing the stowaways,

37:51.050 --> 37:53.050
It is clear there is a survivor.

37:53.550 --> 37:54.800
Now there is evidence,
that there is a survivor.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.300
All this, why is it?

37:56.300 --> 38:00.050
Now you starting a game

38:00.050 --> 38:02.300
He is in Bundang.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.550
Byeong Woo case is the first case.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.550
Nowadays, even doctors
could be an investigator?

38:06.550 --> 38:08.050
You are the police chief, Seongnam?

38:08.050 --> 38:09.050
Yes sir.

38:09.050 --> 38:09.550
Mr. Mayor

38:09.550 --> 38:11.050
If this is an epidemic,

38:11.050 --> 38:12.050
This will spread
faster than we can imagine.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.300
You're a doctor, right?

38:14.300 --> 38:17.050
It seems you have no idea
what is your duty.

38:17.050 --> 38:18.800
Don't create problems here.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.550
If you were given a choice ...

38:20.550 --> 38:22.050
Would you want to destroy or build?

38:22.050 --> 38:23.550
You make your own choice!

38:40.300 --> 38:41.550
Mr. Director,

38:41.550 --> 38:42.300
Currently we are in a critical situation.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.300
The number of patients is increasing rapidly.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.050
Professor,

38:44.050 --> 38:45.300
currently, all hospitals in Bundang

38:45.300 --> 38:46.800
are filled with infected patients.

38:51.050 --> 38:51.800
Doctor,

38:51.800 --> 38:53.050
we must speed up the process.

39:16.050 --> 39:17.800
Uncle ...

39:19.050 --> 39:21.050
Uncle rescuer .

39:26.550 --> 39:27.300
Here, here.

39:27.300 --> 39:28.300
Immediately handle it.

39:28.300 --> 39:29.550
How about now?

39:29.550 --> 39:31.550
Come on ...

39:34.550 --> 39:36.800
Currently, we will begin the evacuation.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.800
Right now, don't go to any  crowded places.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.050
I can not think of much right now,

39:41.050 --> 39:42.050
Oh, there,

39:42.050 --> 39:43.800
Stay there, do not go anywhere.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.050
I'm going to meet mom there.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.050
I understand.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
Get on board.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.050
After finishing your call.

39:49.050 --> 39:49.550
Professor,

39:49.550 --> 39:51.300
currently, my daughter is alone out there ...

39:51.300 --> 39:52.550
Let me go for awhile...

39:52.550 --> 39:53.300
Dr. Kim.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.550
You don't know how's
the conditions out there today.

39:54.550 --> 39:55.550
That's all right.

39:56.300 --> 39:59.800
I believe you can survive,

40:00.050 --> 40:01.800
Don't worry, come back quickly.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.550
Where is she ...

40:08.550 --> 40:10.300
View the previous recordings.

40:10.550 --> 40:12.050
The previous recordings,
is the one below that.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
4 May, 15 hours After Infections
Liaison Road, Bundang

40:13.500 --> 40:15.550
Don't tell me, mom can't go there?

40:15.800 --> 40:18.050
Actually, what happened in Bundang?

40:18.300 --> 40:20.550
Speak slowly so mom can understand.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.050
Mom, don't come here.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.050
I'm going to seoul with Mi Reu.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.550
We must make a public notification

40:32.800 --> 40:37.550
If people knew, they will not remain silent.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.800
If you make an announcement about this,
everything is going awry

40:39.800 --> 40:42.050
And it will further spread the virus.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.800
Mayor Choi ...

40:45.050 --> 40:46.300
We have to tell him,
the Prime Minister.

40:46.550 --> 40:47.800
This is my territory.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.050
Once you tell him, this problem will be widespread.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.800
Sir ...

40:52.050 --> 40:53.800
Why are these guys?

40:53.800 --> 40:55.550
He's exaggerating it.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.800
All we have to do now is
to stop the spread of this outbreak

41:00.050 --> 41:02.050
So we will make an announcement
after meeting with the President.

41:02.050 --> 41:03.800
Mayor Choi.

41:04.050 --> 41:07.800
From now on, leave this to me.

41:08.050 --> 41:09.550
Prime Minister, the President is here.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.550
Once infected, all will die immediately,

41:15.800 --> 41:17.550
Plus there is no cure.
Is this true?

41:17.800 --> 41:19.050
Even so, until now ...

41:19.300 --> 41:20.550
We have made a decision.

41:20.550 --> 41:22.300
Will hold a public announcement,
until after Bundang's isolation.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.300
Give the report to me now.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.800
How long does it take
to isolate Bundang.

41:30.800 --> 41:40.550
All road users,
you are not allowed to pass through...

41:42.550 --> 41:44.050
What happened?

41:44.550 --> 41:47.300
I'm heading there,
where are you?

41:47.800 --> 41:52.800
She was heading to ...

41:55.300 --> 41:58.050
That's E-Mart's door, right?

41:58.300 --> 42:08.300
Yesterday, an influenza epidemic has spread
in some areas, in Bundang

42:08.550 --> 42:14.550
The Epidemic Prevention Division had done an inspection
and conclude that this is some sort of epidemic.

42:14.550 --> 42:19.300
This is a new flu outbreak
and it's very dangerous,

42:19.800 --> 42:22.800
For the safety of you all,
I will do my best ...

42:23.050 --> 42:25.050
Why not give the medicine for the cure.

42:25.050 --> 42:26.550
To date, there is no cure
for this disease.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.300
The people who had survived it has not been found,
So how can we make the antibodies

42:29.550 --> 42:33.300
The estimated number of the infected
and the dead will rise.

42:33.550 --> 42:35.550
Are you saying that,
this epidemic will kill thousands of lives?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.550
Maybe there will be
10 thousand people who died.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.550
Where Mi Reu,
Where my Mi Reu.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.300
There...

42:44.550 --> 42:45.050
It's her ...

42:45.300 --> 42:46.550
Where Mi Reu, my daughter is now?

42:47.550 --> 42:49.300
Mom ...

42:52.050 --> 42:54.050
Mom...

43:00.050 --> 43:01.300
Mi Reu ...

43:01.550 --> 43:02.800
Mi Reu ...

43:17.300 --> 43:21.550
Let's do it this way, the first to
find Mi Reu immediate update.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.300
Wait, you need to use a mask.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.550
Mi Reu ...

43:27.550 --> 43:33.300
Mom ...

43:33.550 --> 43:40.300
Mi Reu ...

43:54.050 --> 43:56.300
Are you okay?

44:01.050 --> 44:03.050
Mom...

44:11.050 --> 44:12.550
Mi Reu ...

44:12.550 --> 44:14.300
Mi Reu ...
Are you okay?

44:14.550 --> 44:18.800
This is mom ...
This is mom ...

44:19.300 --> 44:22.550
Why's Mi Reu here?

44:23.300 --> 44:25.800
Come here.

44:26.550 --> 44:29.050
Mom...

44:32.550 --> 44:34.050
Wear your mask.

44:35.300 --> 44:39.300
Police has decided to
blockade the supermarket ...

44:51.550 --> 44:53.800
We have to get out of here.

44:56.050 --> 44:57.550
There ...

45:00.550 --> 45:01.800
Mom,

45:02.050 --> 45:03.550
Be still, Mi Reu ...

45:07.550 --> 45:09.050
Mom come quick,

45:34.050 --> 45:36.550
My son is outside.

45:38.550 --> 45:39.550
Hello professor,

45:39.800 --> 45:42.300
The situation is dire, you have to come soon,
This will be the last flight.

45:42.550 --> 45:44.300
Can you add for one more person?

45:44.300 --> 45:46.050
There's one more person who will come on board.

45:46.300 --> 45:47.300
Okay, I understand.

45:47.550 --> 45:48.800
Alright, thank you Professor.

45:52.300 --> 45:54.800
Come on, we got to get out of here.

45:54.800 --> 45:57.550
Come with us, let's get out of here.

45:57.550 --> 45:59.800
In Hae, you go ahead.

46:00.300 --> 46:04.050
Ji goo, over there, there are the infected.

46:05.050 --> 46:09.050
I know, but I'm a rescuers team member.

46:09.300 --> 46:12.050
Not a single person here who knows
you're a rescuers team member.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.300
I know that ...

46:21.550 --> 46:25.800
Here, take my car with Mi Reu
hurry away from here ...

46:27.050 --> 46:30.300
Mi Reu, you know right where uncle's car is.

46:30.550 --> 46:34.550
This time don't let go of
mom's hand, understands.

46:41.050 --> 46:45.550
This time don't forget to wash my car,
and return it to me, okay.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.550
Wait.

46:53.800 --> 46:57.550
Mom....
Mom...

46:57.800 --> 46:59.800
Why don't we go with uncle?

47:00.050 --> 47:02.300
He is helping the people there.

47:16.300 --> 47:19.800
Sheesh ..you can open it with your feet?

47:20.050 --> 47:21.800
Damaging something with a kick,
it's not the time now.

47:22.050 --> 47:24.550
Out there, it's like an earthquake zone.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.300
Can't you come earlier ...

47:25.550 --> 47:28.800
You just called ...

47:36.800 --> 47:38.550
Be careful ...

47:38.800 --> 47:39.050
Thank you

47:39.050 --> 47:40.550
My son ...

47:41.300 --> 47:43.800
Slowly ...

47:44.300 --> 47:46.300
This part is very sharp.

47:46.550 --> 47:49.300
Sir, thank you, thank you ...

47:49.550 --> 47:51.550
Yes, thank you as well...

47:53.800 --> 47:55.050
I had to go on board the helicopter now,

47:55.300 --> 47:57.050
I a Medical Staff,  Kim In Hae.

47:57.300 --> 47:59.050
Definitely on the list.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.800
Well, wait a minute.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.050
There's no time,

48:05.300 --> 48:06.800
Alright, immediately go there.

48:09.050 --> 48:10.800
Ahh, Stop ..stop.

48:11.050 --> 48:11.550
Why?

48:11.800 --> 48:13.550
This child is not allowed to go
if she has the flu symptoms.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.800
It's not the flu.

48:15.050 --> 48:16.550
It's just a regular cough,
It will disappear by itself.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.050
We do not care about it.

48:18.300 --> 48:19.050
The child...

48:19.300 --> 48:20.050
Please step aside.

48:20.300 --> 48:22.050
The current spread of bird flu
is very dangerous

48:22.300 --> 48:23.800
The symptoms are skin redness.

48:24.050 --> 48:26.050
I'm a medical expert.

48:26.300 --> 48:27.800
Just because of a small cough,
we can not pass!

48:28.050 --> 48:28.300
I know, I know

48:28.550 --> 48:30.300
My daughter is not having a fever.

48:30.550 --> 48:31.550
We just following the existing regulations.

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
Hey, this is ...

48:33.050 --> 48:34.300
Go back.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.050
It has been confirmed, it is the H5N1 virus.

48:43.300 --> 48:48.050
It'll infect birds or man

48:48.300 --> 48:51.300
and then spread to others.

48:51.550 --> 48:55.300
It had  recently also appeared in Zhejiang
and Jiangsu in China and in other places.

48:55.550 --> 49:01.050
It has emerged as H7N9.

49:01.300 --> 49:06.550
In Indonesia and other countries,
this flu has spreads from human to human.

49:06.550 --> 49:09.800
A Korean outbreak like this does not exist,

49:10.050 --> 49:13.800
But it appears that this is the H5N1 virus

49:14.050 --> 49:17.300
Like normal influenza,
but with high infection rates.

49:17.550 --> 49:19.800
Can  be said as a monster virus.

49:20.050 --> 49:22.550
Virus spread can only be prevented
by using masks.

49:22.800 --> 49:25.550
So we can use the gas mask.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.550
Never remove the gas mask guys.

49:27.550 --> 49:29.300
Prepare to leave.

49:30.300 --> 49:33.050
Car. No. 26, Car. No. 24, start moving..

49:44.800 --> 49:49.550
As a President, it's a very painful moment,
at not being able to protect ...

49:49.800 --> 49:51.300
People's lives are precious
and existing national assets,

49:51.300 --> 49:53.050
can only remain in place.

49:53.300 --> 49:57.300
For all those who are affected by this
epidemic and is facing this situation,

49:57.550 --> 49:59.050
I have a full responsibility on all this.

49:59.300 --> 50:04.300
To resolve the problem of the
influenza outbreaks in Bundang's area,

50:04.550 --> 50:06.050
We as a government, will put in our
maximum efforts.

50:06.300 --> 50:09.300
This is my promise to all
my people are out there.

50:10.050 --> 50:16.300
To all the residents of Bundang,
I beg you to hold on and survive.

50:17.300 --> 50:21.550
Everybody should wear a mask.

50:21.800 --> 50:27.050
The Government has set isolation
regions for this outbreak,

50:27.300 --> 50:29.050
For anyone who is still healthy ...

50:30.550 --> 50:32.300
How come, you did not board the flight?

50:32.550 --> 50:37.050
Sorry Professor, but there are a survivor
from the container.

50:37.300 --> 50:40.300
If he's still alive, we can make antibodies.

50:40.550 --> 50:43.550
The police were looking for him.
The police will soon find him.

50:44.050 --> 50:47.300
Professor, currently everyone
is brought to the same isolation area.

50:47.550 --> 50:50.800
You know how dangerous it is to gather all
the people in one place at this time.

50:51.050 --> 50:52.300
We are still looking for a way out.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.050
If you've reach there, give the description
of the survivor to them.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.050
And leave there as soon as possible
with your daughter.

51:05.800 --> 51:11.800
To speed up the process of evacuation,
immediately prepare your Identity Card.

51:12.050 --> 51:14.800
Just for the influenza outbreak,
it involve the helicopters as well.

51:15.050 --> 51:16.800
Things like this cause a reduced
supply of oil in this country.

51:17.050 --> 51:17.800
Geez ...

51:18.050 --> 51:20.550
Our country is really ...

51:23.050 --> 51:24.750
Everyone at Bundang at the moment,

51:24.900 --> 51:28.400
is considered a potentially
infectious person,

51:28.520 --> 51:30.520
and will be segregated at the camp.

51:32.550 --> 51:36.300
We initially track down the
infectious person by visual examination.

51:38.300 --> 51:39.800
Is this a sign?

51:40.300 --> 51:42.050
You have a red mark.

51:42.300 --> 51:46.800
The various status of contamination
will be determined through PCR test.

51:47.050 --> 51:49.550
A symptomatic person,
within the first 48 hours

51:49.800 --> 51:54.300
with a negative test results
may leave the camp.

51:54.550 --> 51:56.300
This way it's too dangerous.

51:56.550 --> 51:59.050
Placing an infected person and
non infected in the same place.

51:59.300 --> 52:01.550
The number of infected
will increase sharply.

52:01.800 --> 52:02.300
In the end ...

52:02.300 --> 52:03.550
Wait a minute.

52:03.800 --> 52:08.800
If we don't control it, the
infected people will travel from Bundang.

52:09.050 --> 52:10.300
And our country will be finished.

52:10.550 --> 52:12.800
Is that not what you said, Doctor.

52:13.050 --> 52:17.550
Even if it's just in Bundang,
we must not let the virus is spread.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.800
so we have to focus on the containment.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.800
It's not necessarily that the person making contact
with an infected person,  will be infected as well.

52:24.050 --> 52:25.800
The estimates is about 50% chance.

52:26.050 --> 52:28.050
and the remaining 50%
is not necessarily healthy.

52:28.050 --> 52:29.050
Although we isolate them.

52:29.300 --> 52:30.300
The prime minister,

52:30.550 --> 52:32.800
50% of the residents of Bundang is
equivalent to more than 200 thousand inhabitants.

52:32.800 --> 52:35.800
Doctor, if 50% of the citizens of Korea,
how many is that?

52:36.050 --> 52:38.300
You're going to infect 25 million people.

52:38.550 --> 52:41.550
I want to say, we have to find a way
to treat it and make antibodies

52:41.800 --> 52:43.050
Ahhh ... I understand, I understand ...

52:43.050 --> 52:45.050
From now on,

52:45.300 --> 52:48.050
We will focus on the isolation plan.

52:48.300 --> 52:53.300
The prime minister, saw in several towns in
Egypt and other countries in the isolation,

52:53.550 --> 52:56.050
The young children there are
using the internet, youtube...

52:56.300 --> 52:58.800
They record video with their hand phone,

52:59.050 --> 53:01.050
then send it via the internet with attach comments.

53:01.300 --> 53:03.800
Then the blockade must include
the Bundang's area network.

53:04.050 --> 53:05.300
The blockade includes its communication network.

53:05.550 --> 53:07.300
It's a very good idea.

53:07.550 --> 53:10.300
Such a control would make
the crisis control becomes easier.

53:10.550 --> 53:11.300
Wait.

53:11.550 --> 53:13.800
I didn't say about quarantine.

53:13.800 --> 53:16.050
Quarantining them together is not the right thing.

53:17.550 --> 53:19.550
I don't approve of this.

53:20.050 --> 53:23.050
We do not need your permission in this meeting.

53:25.050 --> 53:26.800
Why there is no mobile network here ...

53:37.300 --> 53:38.300
Oh, wait a minute.

53:38.300 --> 53:41.800
Hello, I'm Kim In Hae,
a member of Bundang Infection Control Center.

53:42.050 --> 53:43.550
Have you filled your name and identity card?

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
I should have joined the medical team.

53:46.050 --> 53:48.050
Due to a slight problem, I came here.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.300
Can you call my boss?

53:50.550 --> 53:52.550
No. 2967, look behind you.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.300
Because of you Aunty, the rest is delayed.

53:54.550 --> 53:55.800
If you need confirmation,

53:56.050 --> 53:57.550
Phone Dr. Yang for confirmation.

53:57.550 --> 53:59.300
Your number is 2966.

53:59.550 --> 54:00.800
Next.

54:11.050 --> 54:14.800
Just now I was alone at home,

54:15.050 --> 54:18.800
Now every one can see me...

54:26.800 --> 54:28.300
That's uncle.

54:28.550 --> 54:29.800
Mi Reu ...

54:30.550 --> 54:32.300
Uncle's naked.

54:33.050 --> 54:35.300
Move along..move along...

54:37.800 --> 54:39.800
Don't look.

54:40.050 --> 54:41.550
Why?

54:42.050 --> 54:43.300
I told you, don't look.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.300
Hey kid, why?

54:46.550 --> 54:49.050
Why did you do this?
Are you mad huh?

54:52.050 --> 54:53.800
Ah you're hot ...

54:56.550 --> 54:58.550
Mom will tied back your hair.

55:09.550 --> 55:11.550
Mom, let's go forward.

55:12.050 --> 55:14.050
Quick ...quick...

55:14.300 --> 55:16.050
Mom...

56:14.800 --> 56:18.550
3899 I'm going to take a sample
from your mouth, open your mouth wide.

56:18.800 --> 56:19.800
Come on.

56:20.050 --> 56:20.800
Put the hand bag below.

56:21.050 --> 56:22.550
Extend your arm.

56:23.550 --> 56:27.300
Mom, 2966 what is that?

56:27.550 --> 56:29.550
It's a replacement number for name.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.050
Mi reu 2966

56:31.050 --> 56:33.300
And mom is 2967, understands.

56:36.550 --> 56:38.050
Don't cough.

56:38.050 --> 56:39.300
Why?

56:39.800 --> 56:43.050
If you're coughing, they will not
put mom and Mi Reu together.

56:46.800 --> 56:51.050
Please follow the instructions of the
commander in the region of isolation ...

56:57.220 --> 57:02.220
Isolation  Area After 10 Hours
Tan Chuan Barrack, Non Infection Area.

57:08.300 --> 57:11.050
Can't you see there's already
too many people here.

57:13.550 --> 57:15.300
Mom, I'm hungry.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.300
Why did you let me
slept on this thing?

57:17.800 --> 57:19.050
Mom, come on.

57:20.550 --> 57:21.800
Mi Reu ...

57:22.050 --> 57:23.050
Oh uncle.

57:23.550 --> 57:24.050
I've been looking for you guys since yesterday.

57:24.300 --> 57:26.050
Kim Mi Reu you should not be
in contact with the uncle.

57:29.050 --> 57:31.300
Why like this so suddenly.

57:31.300 --> 57:34.050
Did I do something wrong?

57:34.800 --> 57:36.550
Absolutely not.

57:38.800 --> 57:41.550
Did I make you angry?

57:42.050 --> 57:44.550
Let me help you,
It's it wrong to help you here.

57:44.550 --> 57:47.550
I don't want you to help us.

57:47.800 --> 57:50.300
You're ...

57:53.300 --> 57:55.300
Forget it.

58:00.550 --> 58:05.550
Because I'm worried
I'm here with you two.

58:05.800 --> 58:10.300
Now that you have said that ...
It was a bit excessive ...

58:14.550 --> 58:16.050
Bye uncle.

58:16.050 --> 58:19.050
Sir, you really don't know the
current conditions in Bundang.

58:19.300 --> 58:22.300
Everyone here lived
in a large apartment.

58:22.800 --> 58:26.550
Now you tell us to
live in a small tent.

58:26.800 --> 58:30.800
At the very least you should
let us bring our own tent.

58:31.050 --> 58:33.050
You think you could organize us arbitrary?

58:33.300 --> 58:35.050
How can we live here ...

58:35.300 --> 58:38.300
There's no water and the toilet don't work.

58:38.550 --> 58:40.300
We're like dogs or pigs.

58:40.800 --> 58:42.800
Now we are ...

58:43.300 --> 58:46.050
I order you back to your tents, fucker.

58:46.300 --> 58:49.300
I just wanted to say, I'm done.

58:51.050 --> 58:53.800
Why do you treat us like this.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.800
Hey, from now on, no one is
longer allowed to complain.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.550
There should be no more saying
you are not satisfied.

59:00.800 --> 59:04.050
Hey sir,
do you think about what are you doing?

59:04.300 --> 59:04.800
Who are you?

59:05.050 --> 59:07.300
Don't talk like that to me.
I asked you, what did he do?

59:07.550 --> 59:09.550
Damn, are you dead?

59:09.800 --> 59:11.550
Wait a minute.

59:11.550 --> 59:12.550
Everyone stop.

59:12.800 --> 59:13.800
Calm down.

59:14.050 --> 59:16.300
Why you fucking interrupts!

59:19.300 --> 59:20.800
Troops leader.

59:23.550 --> 59:26.550
All the people are looking at you right now.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.550
Take it.

59:29.050 --> 59:31.300
Young, and full of anger.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.050
Everybody knows how's the current situation.

59:37.300 --> 59:38.300
Yes sir.

59:38.550 --> 59:39.300
Return to your tents.

59:39.550 --> 59:41.050
We must not be bunched together.

59:41.300 --> 59:42.300
Return to your tents.

59:44.300 --> 59:47.300
B17 back to your tent.

59:47.550 --> 59:48.300
Where?

59:48.550 --> 59:50.050
Tent B17 ...

59:53.050 --> 59:58.050
Mom, I don't cough anymore.

59:58.050 --> 1:00:00.050
Good.

1:00:03.050 --> 1:00:07.050
Mi Reu, It's OK
That's all right.

1:00:09.300 --> 1:00:13.550
After quarantining residents in Bundang area,
Bundang residents faced another problem ...

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:20.300
Unilateral enforcement of isolation
with no notice,

1:00:20.550 --> 1:00:26.300
This makes people angry,
and very difficult to stabilize.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:28.550
If Seoul were also infected,
How will ...

1:00:28.550 --> 1:00:33.300
Blockage of   Bundang area received
35% of the Korean's public support.

1:00:33.550 --> 1:00:35.200
The blockade in Bundang area
is still be a controversy.

1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:37.550
They are not concerned with our loss,

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:41.050
They are only worried about the effect
against themselves ...

1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:43.050
It's a normal thing for humans.

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:47.050
So it is best,
to send CDC scientists there.

1:00:47.300 --> 1:00:50.050
Isolation in Bundang area is good.

1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:54.300
Even if you invest more money
it will have no effect at this time.

1:00:54.550 --> 1:00:57.300
Dr., It's the Americans who are
currently in charge at the moment.

1:00:57.550 --> 1:00:59.800
Either you accept it or understand it.

1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:03.550
To enforce it,
let the government's employees do it.

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:07.050
Our members're not many.

1:01:07.300 --> 1:01:08.800
I know that guy.

1:01:09.050 --> 1:01:14.300
He's Jeon Gook Hwan,
the Commander in Qingnan in the year of 2009

1:01:14.550 --> 1:01:16.800
Ah, right.

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:20.050
At that time, two of our members died.

1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:21.550
No wonder.

1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:24.800
You know all the members of the
infected rescuer teams?

1:01:25.050 --> 1:01:27.550
Bundang rescuer team?

1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:31.050
I'm going.

1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:33.300
But you two look quite healthy.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:37.050
We're fine now,
but we still have to wait for test results.

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.550
Sir, the information is accurate but ...

1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:43.800
did you see it yourself?

1:01:46.050 --> 1:01:49.050
In a disaster like this, nothing is certain.

1:01:51.050 --> 1:01:54.300
What if after 48 hours the symptoms
of infections did not appear.

1:01:54.550 --> 1:01:55.800
I will assign you again,

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.550
What do you think?

1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:00.300
We still have 48 hours to make sure

1:02:00.300 --> 1:02:02.300
accurately.

1:02:07.300 --> 1:02:10.050
Please confirm for No.3889

1:02:10.300 --> 1:02:11.800
-3889
- Here.

1:02:12.050 --> 1:02:13.800
So what do we do now?

1:02:14.050 --> 1:02:16.050
Why is everyone so agitated.

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:21.300
No. 3890

1:02:21.550 --> 1:02:23.050
3890 ...

1:02:23.300 --> 1:02:24.550
You cannot go out.

1:02:29.050 --> 1:02:30.050
You've enforced it?

1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:31.300
Yes.

1:02:31.300 --> 1:02:33.550
He can't get out.

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:35.300
I told you so ...

1:02:37.300 --> 1:02:40.800
I will lead the troops to
shift to a safe area.

1:02:41.050 --> 1:02:43.800
- 3798, No.3798
- That's his number.

1:02:44.050 --> 1:02:46.050
Please show your identity card.

1:02:53.050 --> 1:02:54.800
It is very difficult to get food here.

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:56.800
If you are not a civil servants,
you will not get it.

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:05.300
Oh, she's here too.

1:03:05.550 --> 1:03:07.800
Silent.

1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:12.050
Well, there's news ..

1:03:12.300 --> 1:03:18.300
that, the infected will be killed.

1:03:18.550 --> 1:03:21.050
They will all be shipped out of here.

1:03:21.550 --> 1:03:25.050
How could it happen in Bundang?

1:03:25.300 --> 1:03:27.050
This place is a district
under our jurisdiction.

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:29.550
You think I'm making this up.

1:03:30.050 --> 1:03:30.550
That man said it.

1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:31.300
I understand ... I understand.

1:03:31.550 --> 1:03:33.800
Don't be constantly with him
You're not his subordinates.

1:03:34.050 --> 1:03:37.800
But it's more than a day,
the people here are not supplied with water.

1:03:38.300 --> 1:03:42.800
They do not want to put us together with
the infected, but they make us die of hunger.

1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:45.800
Eat a little.

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:49.550
I've no appetite,
after all, why I should eat.

1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:52.300
They said they would give
bread tomorrow, but eat a little.

1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:56.800
Ahh, never mind.

1:04:04.300 --> 1:04:06.550
Pretend you didn't saw it.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:08.550
Hmm.

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:20.550
In Hae, I understand,
you don't want to be separated from Mi Reu,

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:22.800
But holding Mi Reu here
is dangerous as well.

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:24.800
We don't make contact with others.

1:04:25.050 --> 1:04:27.050
We always wore masks.

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:30.300
So we are not going to infect others.

1:04:30.550 --> 1:04:32.550
I'll take care of her.

1:04:35.050 --> 1:04:37.550
How can you be so selfish.

1:04:38.050 --> 1:04:39.550
You're not even a doctor here.

1:04:39.550 --> 1:04:47.300
There is currently no treatment
for this outbreak.

1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:50.300
What do you mean?

1:04:50.550 --> 1:04:54.300
At this moment everyone
infected are being treated.

1:04:54.550 --> 1:04:58.300
Ji goo, as you say ...
I'm a doctor.

1:04:58.300 --> 1:05:01.550
I understand better the current
situation than anyone else here.

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:04.300
So you're saying,
what the government says is a lie?

1:05:04.550 --> 1:05:06.800
So what they do with those people?

1:05:07.050 --> 1:05:08.300
I don't know,

1:05:08.550 --> 1:05:15.550
But definitely, what is said by
your seniors it's not just a rumor.

1:05:17.300 --> 1:05:19.500
So if you've been infected,
you will be killed along with the others?

1:05:19.550 --> 1:05:22.800
If we also infected,
we will be killed as well?

1:05:37.050 --> 1:05:44.300
I..  I need to be with Mi Reu.

1:05:52.550 --> 1:06:01.300
Mi Reu ... It's all because of me.

1:06:01.550 --> 1:06:05.550
No, it's not all because of you,

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:24.550
I, as her mother,
is not taking care of her well.

1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:43.050
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry ...

1:07:16.050 --> 1:07:20.050
Currently, the sound of gunshots is heard,
It is the sound of gunshots to kill birds in Bundang

1:07:20.300 --> 1:07:23.800
This is a precautionary measure to
prevent the spread of the virus.

1:07:24.050 --> 1:07:25.800
Each person, please line up to get food.

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:35.550
Brother, you came.

1:07:42.550 --> 1:07:44.550
I think, that guy knows about everything.

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:48.300
This time it must be true.

1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:54.050
At a time like this you're still
dealing with love affairs.

1:07:54.300 --> 1:07:56.300
It's not what you imagine.

1:07:56.800 --> 1:07:59.550
You can lie to anyone,
but not with me, I know you.

1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:00.800
You continue to pay attention to her ...

1:08:01.050 --> 1:08:03.800
I told you it's not like
what you imagine.

1:08:05.050 --> 1:08:08.800
Hey, why are you so sensitive
if it's about her.

1:08:09.050 --> 1:08:10.050
- Look at your red face ...
- Brother,

1:08:10.050 --> 1:08:13.050
I don't feel like joking.

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:15.800
I'm just kidding.

1:08:16.050 --> 1:08:16.300
I understand ... I understand.

1:08:16.550 --> 1:08:18.050
How could you think ...

1:08:18.590 --> 1:08:22.190
Infected Patients Area
(Fitness Center Complex's Parking Area)

1:08:33.300 --> 1:08:36.050
This guy has a normal body temperature.

1:08:36.300 --> 1:08:38.300
Forget it,
Even so, he still brought here.

1:08:38.550 --> 1:08:40.550
Wait.

1:08:41.550 --> 1:08:43.050
He looks like the man we're looking for.

1:08:43.300 --> 1:08:43.800
Wait.

1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:45.550
Try to open his mask.

1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:47.050
It's him.

1:08:47.050 --> 1:08:48.550
Try facing here.

1:08:58.550 --> 1:09:00.300
Dr. Kim, what are you doing here?

1:09:00.550 --> 1:09:02.300
Dr. Kim In Hae.

1:09:03.050 --> 1:09:06.300
We have found the survivor of the container.

1:09:06.550 --> 1:09:08.800
He has been infected,
but he's still alive today.

1:09:09.550 --> 1:09:12.300
If we managed to make antibodies,
treatment for the infected can be done.

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.300
Really, there will be a cure.

1:09:16.050 --> 1:09:19.050
In the meantime, please take care of Mi Reu.

1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:20.550
Quickly go then.

1:09:22.300 --> 1:09:25.050
Mom, you told me you wouldn't to leave.

1:09:25.300 --> 1:09:29.050
Mom would soon return.

1:09:29.300 --> 1:09:31.300
It's a lie.

1:09:31.550 --> 1:09:33.550
Mom do this for Mi Reu.

1:09:36.300 --> 1:09:39.050
Mom would soon return.

1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:41.800
Don't lie, I would know.

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:48.050
Look at this,

1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:50.050
This Mi Reu, over.

1:09:50.300 --> 1:09:52.050
This Mi Reu, over.

1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:55.050
In Hae, you tried it too, just so you know
whether her voice is transmitting or not.

1:09:56.550 --> 1:09:58.550
Mi Reu, this is mom.

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:00.300
Mi Reu also answer, yes.

1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:01.800
Mom.

1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:03.300
Can hear, yes.

1:10:03.550 --> 1:10:07.800
If Mi Reu call mom,
mom will certainly hear it.

1:10:08.050 --> 1:10:10.050
Of course, then mom will
quickly run here.

1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:11.800
Don't worry.

1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:14.050
Over.

1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:16.300
Mom, Over.

1:10:16.300 --> 1:10:20.300
He had been infected for more than 2 weeks,
and his conditions is still very stable.

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:22.300
I have already done the blood tests as well.

1:10:23.050 --> 1:10:25.800
Currently, we can make antibodies for a cure.

1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:27.550
What do you think?

1:10:28.050 --> 1:10:30.300
Yes, I think so as well.

1:10:30.550 --> 1:10:32.550
Professor, if the serum is separated,

1:10:32.550 --> 1:10:35.050
What we can directly inject the
patients to see how he reacts?

1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:36.050
No,

1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:40.300
We have to wait and confirmed the effectiveness
of these antibodies against the virus

1:10:40.550 --> 1:10:42.800
Although the current situation is very
precarious, we still have to wait.

1:10:43.050 --> 1:10:44.800
Only then we can separate the serum.

1:10:48.300 --> 1:10:49.800
You want to do it,

1:10:50.050 --> 1:10:51.300
You do not know for sure
if it has not been medically tested.

1:10:51.550 --> 1:10:54.050
Injecting antibodies into the body of the
infected, can be very dangerous.

1:10:54.050 --> 1:10:56.550
It can be fatal.

1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:58.300
Sorry.

1:11:14.550 --> 1:11:16.050
Mi Reu.

1:11:19.550 --> 1:11:22.550
How?
Are you able to heal Mi Reu?

1:11:25.550 --> 1:11:27.050
Doctor, let's go.

1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:33.050
Uncle will meet Mi Reu again.

1:11:33.050 --> 1:11:34.550
Where's No.2966

1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:39.050
2966, No.2966

1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:42.800
There's no one inside.

1:11:43.550 --> 1:11:45.550
Stop right there.

1:11:46.550 --> 1:11:48.550
Where's 2966?

1:11:52.550 --> 1:11:54.550
Who's 2966

1:11:55.300 --> 1:11:57.050
We want to confirm your ID..

1:12:00.300 --> 1:12:03.050
2966, that's me.

1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:05.050
No. 2966 identified as infected.

1:12:05.050 --> 1:12:06.800
Please show your ID card.

1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:11.550
Identity card, wait a minute.

1:12:12.550 --> 1:12:18.050
In Hae, give my card.

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:21.300
You're saving my cards right.

1:12:21.550 --> 1:12:22.800
Come on.

1:12:31.050 --> 1:12:32.550
Go.

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:34.550
This is 2966.

1:12:34.550 --> 1:12:36.550
Wait, sorry.

1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:40.300
Why are you being 2966?

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:44.300
Because my number is 2966 so 2966.

1:12:44.550 --> 1:12:45.800
2966 has been identified as infected,

1:12:46.050 --> 1:12:47.050
That way you will be brought there.

1:12:51.300 --> 1:12:53.300
Brother, I have to go there.

1:12:53.550 --> 1:12:56.300
No.2966, you have to be moved
to the quarantine area.

1:12:58.300 --> 1:13:00.050
Move it.

1:13:20.550 --> 1:13:22.300
Move to the second quarantine area.

1:13:38.050 --> 1:13:39.550
Where the bastards who killed my younger brother?

1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:41.300
You are the one doing all of this, fucker.

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:52.300
Hey, was your mask was open just now?

1:13:52.550 --> 1:13:54.050
No.

1:13:57.800 --> 1:13:59.550
This is the room where you make a decision?

1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:00.800
Yes

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:05.550
This many people who are not infected
after 48 hours?

1:14:06.300 --> 1:14:07.800
Mr. President,

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.300
If I can offer some proven explanation.

1:14:10.550 --> 1:14:13.550
The virus is spreads so rapidly through the camp,
that we simply cannot afford to let anyone out.

1:14:16.050 --> 1:14:17.550
A promise remains a promise.

1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:19.050
If they must be moved,
then we must move them.

1:14:19.300 --> 1:14:20.550
It's not like that, Mr. President.

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:23.800
There are 23 thousand people left at
the barrack to take care for...

1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:26.800
Those who survive will be more,

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:27.800
Who said that?

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:28.800
This report from the medical team there.

1:14:29.050 --> 1:14:31.050
So they ordered them
not to go anywhere.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.050
Should further tighten the vigil.

1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:37.050
There's no other choice,

1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:39.800
Although this will make
Bundang's residents suffer

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:41.550
But the important thing now is the
security of the Republic of Korea

1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:45.550
Is the residents of Bundang
not part of the Republic of Korea?

1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:49.050
This is not just about Korea any more.

1:14:49.300 --> 1:14:53.300
If this virus spreads,
the impact on the world could be ...

1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:58.550
Please remember, the eyes of the world
is on Korean right now.

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:03.300
He's my only my friend.

1:15:03.550 --> 1:15:08.550
Seniors, even if you're out of here,
Bundang is not easy to leave.

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.300
I can take care of that.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.550
You don't need to be like this.

1:15:20.050 --> 1:15:21.550
Senior brother.

1:15:22.050 --> 1:15:24.300
I do not know,
if you can help me ...

1:15:24.550 --> 1:15:26.800
Ahh,  someone seems to have dropped this thing.

1:15:27.550 --> 1:15:29.550
Thank you, really thank you.

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:31.550
Thank you, Senior brother.

1:15:39.050 --> 1:15:42.550
Still have to wait
for the next result,

1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:44.050
You better get some rest.

1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:46.800
You have not taken much break, right?

1:15:47.050 --> 1:15:49.550
Kim In Hae is also concerned
with my condition.

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.300
Alright then.

1:15:53.550 --> 1:15:55.550
Watch her carefully.

1:16:06.050 --> 1:16:07.050
Mi Reu ...

1:16:08.050 --> 1:16:11.050
This guy, this guy ...

1:16:12.300 --> 1:16:14.050
Gook Hwan help a lot.

1:16:14.050 --> 1:16:16.050
You have to see him and thank him.

1:16:18.300 --> 1:16:21.800
You may be infected, when you are here.

1:16:22.050 --> 1:16:24.300
Before the results is out,
you should still to use these clothes.

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:31.800
If you want to get out,
you have to prepare 20 million.

1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:37.050
Brother, is In Hae and Mi Reu okay?

1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:39.050
You're really excited.

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:40.050
What kind of woman that ...

1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:43.300
You're really ...

1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:45.550
Brother, please find out ...

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:48.300
48 hours had passed,
in fact it's already overdue by 12 hours.

1:16:48.300 --> 1:16:49.800
But why don't you move us out?

1:16:50.050 --> 1:16:51.550
You see,
I don't have symptoms of the disease.

1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:53.800
My wife was taken for treatment,

1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:55.800
But why isn't there anymore
news about her?

1:17:21.050 --> 1:17:22.800
Hey sergeant, what's the hold up?

1:17:23.050 --> 1:17:24.800
Sir, there seems to be a big problem ...

1:17:25.050 --> 1:17:26.300
Sergeant, just let us go.

1:17:26.550 --> 1:17:28.050
Get out.

1:17:37.550 --> 1:17:39.300
I don't want to hurt you,

1:17:39.550 --> 1:17:43.300
My daughter is dying.

1:17:43.550 --> 1:17:44.550
Only you can help her.

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:46.300
Right now I need your serum.

1:17:46.550 --> 1:17:48.300
I do not want to, I'm afraid.

1:17:49.050 --> 1:17:52.800
Mi Reu..Mi Reu ...

1:17:53.050 --> 1:17:55.050
Mi Reu ...

1:17:57.550 --> 1:18:00.800
Mi Reu ...

1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:07.300
I found Moon Sai ...

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:10.800
Mi Reu ...
Are you okay, Huh?

1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:14.800
Mi Reu... Mi Reu...
Wake up ...

1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:17.050
You need my blood.

1:18:44.300 --> 1:18:46.550
Open the door.

1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:48.800
Kim In Hae, what are you doing?

1:19:00.550 --> 1:19:01.800
What are you doing?

1:19:02.050 --> 1:19:03.050
Put that down!

1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:04.800
Why are you hiding infected children?

1:19:05.050 --> 1:19:08.050
Once the virus is spread,
the treatment will not be useful anymore.

1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:43.550
You're the first to get out of here.

1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:51.800
Please be even faster.

1:19:52.300 --> 1:19:53.800
Yeah, right.

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.050
Come on.

1:20:07.050 --> 1:20:11.800
Mi Reu.. Mi Reu...

1:20:15.050 --> 1:20:17.550
Mi Reu... Mi Reu...

1:20:39.300 --> 1:20:40.800
Have you seen a little girl,
newly brought here?

1:20:41.050 --> 1:20:42.050
Don't touch it,
You can only see her.

1:20:43.550 --> 1:20:44.800
Here,

1:20:45.050 --> 1:20:46.550
There are people who are still alive.

1:20:47.050 --> 1:20:48.800
That person will soon die.

1:20:49.550 --> 1:20:50.300
What?

1:20:50.550 --> 1:20:52.050
I told you, he will die.

1:20:52.300 --> 1:20:53.550
Let's go.

1:20:55.050 --> 1:20:56.550
Hey, are you crazy?

1:20:56.800 --> 1:20:59.800
Can't you see?
This person is still alive.

1:21:00.050 --> 1:21:01.800
What you can't see,
is that, here's no hope.

1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:03.800
Those who're newly brought in today
are over there.

1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:09.300
Mi Reu ...

1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.550
Test result is out ...

1:21:57.550 --> 1:22:01.050
It is confirmed, that it can be used as an antibody.

1:22:01.050 --> 1:22:03.050
Bring him outside.

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:11.550
Where is my daughter, where's my daughter?

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:13.800
Kim In Hae...

1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:16.520
Oh God ...

1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:19.400
Give her the anti-body.

1:22:20.300 --> 1:22:22.550
Where Mi Reu, where Mi Reu?

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.800
She's already taken
to the infected patient.

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:32.300
What did he do?

1:22:49.550 --> 1:22:52.300
Mi Reu ... Mi Reu ...

1:23:10.800 --> 1:23:15.550
Mi Reu ... Mi Reu ...

1:23:20.050 --> 1:23:25.050
Mi Reu ...

1:23:31.300 --> 1:23:33.800
Mi Reu ...

1:23:40.550 --> 1:23:44.050
Mi Reu ...

1:24:38.550 --> 1:24:43.050
I've told you, enough is enough,
from the beginning until now you continue to do this.

1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:54.550
Hey, quickly wear your mask.

1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:55.800
Even if I wear it ...

1:24:56.050 --> 1:24:57.800
Just wear your mask ...

1:24:58.050 --> 1:25:00.800
- I don't want to wear it.
- Wear your mask.

1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:04.550
Just go.

1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:22.550
Mom, how come you're here?

1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:25.550
My son.

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:28.300
I said, why mom could be here?

1:25:28.550 --> 1:25:37.300
Mom came to attend a birthday party of a friend ...

1:25:40.050 --> 1:25:45.300
Mom do you know what this place is ...

1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:51.300
Let go...

1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:56.300
Mom...

1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:01.800
Don't hit my son.

1:26:09.300 --> 1:26:12.300
Uncle will find your mom.

1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:16.550
There vandals from outside.

1:26:27.300 --> 1:26:29.050
Who are you?

1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:31.050
Put down your weapon.

1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:33.050
If you don't comply,
I'll shoot you.

1:26:33.300 --> 1:26:34.800
Shoot! fucker.

1:26:35.050 --> 1:26:37.800
Don't be like that,
mom will be fine.

1:26:38.050 --> 1:26:40.050
Mom will be treated there.

1:26:40.300 --> 1:26:43.800
Mom, look.
Mom will die in there.

1:26:44.050 --> 1:26:45.800
This disease has no cure.

1:26:46.050 --> 1:26:47.300
What do you say damn!

1:26:47.550 --> 1:26:49.300
You better shut up!

1:26:49.550 --> 1:26:51.050
There is no cure for this disease,

1:26:51.050 --> 1:26:51.800
There's no treatment?

1:26:52.050 --> 1:26:58.050
You can see the smoke coming from the
bodies this motherfucker burn.

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:02.050
You want to shoot me?

1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:04.300
Shoot fucker!

1:27:04.550 --> 1:27:05.800
Shoot fucker!

1:27:11.550 --> 1:27:13.300
Hey Min Gun ...

1:27:13.550 --> 1:27:14.800
The man who shot!

1:27:32.050 --> 1:27:35.050
Mi Reu ...

1:28:04.050 --> 1:28:04.800
What the person said is true,

1:28:05.050 --> 1:28:05.800
This is outrageous.

1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:07.550
It's crazy.

1:28:07.550 --> 1:28:08.800
Let's go in there.

1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:12.050
There are only dead people,

1:28:12.300 --> 1:28:13.300
Don't misunderstand me.

1:28:15.550 --> 1:28:17.050
There are those still alive!

1:28:17.550 --> 1:28:19.800
There are those still alive!

1:28:36.300 --> 1:28:37.800
In Hae ...

1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:42.300
Mi Reu ...Mi Reu, it's mom.

1:28:42.550 --> 1:28:43.550
In Hae, you hear me?

1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:45.550
Can you hear me?

1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:47.050
Mi Reu ...

1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:52.550
Dr. Kim In Hae...

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:54.050
There's riots everywhere.

1:28:54.300 --> 1:28:55.800
We have to get out of Bundang.

1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:56.550
I cannot go.

1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:59.300
The antibody that we examined
must not be contaminated,

1:28:59.550 --> 1:29:01.550
There's too many people here,
we should go away from here.

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:04.300
My daughter is still here.

1:29:08.300 --> 1:29:11.550
In Hae, this is Ji Goo..this is Ji Goo,
do you hear me?

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:12.800
Yes.

1:29:13.050 --> 1:29:14.800
Where are you?

1:29:15.050 --> 1:29:18.050
I'm at the parking area of the
Fitness Center Complex.

1:29:18.300 --> 1:29:19.550
Underground car park.

1:29:20.050 --> 1:29:21.800
Mi Reu... Mi Reu...

1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:30.550
They plan to kill us all!

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:33.300
Parking space next to where?

1:29:55.050 --> 1:29:56.800
Stop .. stop ..

1:30:14.550 --> 1:30:17.550
I already at the parking lot,
where are you?

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:22.550
In Hae!

1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:28.550
Kim In Hae!

1:30:36.050 --> 1:30:37.300
Stop!

1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:01.300
Who ordered the soldiers
to retreat with the medical team?

1:31:01.550 --> 1:31:03.550
The situation is no longer under control.

1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:05.800
In this case, if the soldiers is infected
with the medical team could ...

1:31:06.050 --> 1:31:08.550
This happens because you didn't move the
people who are not infected after 48 hours.

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:10.800
We cannot let the people which
may be infected get out.

1:31:11.050 --> 1:31:12.050
So now, what will we do?

1:31:12.300 --> 1:31:15.300
The people who're infected and those uninfected are
separated into certain areas to protect the people.

1:31:15.550 --> 1:31:18.550
To protect medical teams and military teams
is our responsibility as a government.

1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:20.050
What we now have to do is conscript as well?

1:31:20.300 --> 1:31:22.300
How can that be?

1:31:23.050 --> 1:31:24.550
We must protect the antibody.

1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:27.800
If we can protect the antibody,
That would make everyone calm.

1:31:35.550 --> 1:31:37.550
How's your wound?

1:31:37.550 --> 1:31:41.300
You have to protect the antibody ...

1:31:45.550 --> 1:31:47.550
In Hae, can you hear me?

1:31:52.050 --> 1:31:53.300
In hae ...

1:31:53.550 --> 1:31:55.800
You've found Mi Reu?

1:31:56.050 --> 1:31:59.300
Yes, she's with me now.

1:31:59.550 --> 1:32:01.800
Is she still alive?

1:32:02.300 --> 1:32:05.300
I think she'll be fine.

1:32:05.550 --> 1:32:09.800
I can't be sure at this time
but her condition is improving.

1:32:10.300 --> 1:32:13.550
What about the fever?

1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:17.550
The fever has been greatly reduced.

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:21.300
If so, we can immediately
produce antibodies.

1:32:21.550 --> 1:32:25.050
Mi Reu, tell your mom
you're fine.

1:32:25.300 --> 1:32:28.550
Can you continue to keep me
posted on Mi Reu's condition?

1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:31.300
Of course,

1:32:33.300 --> 1:32:35.800
Right now I'm moving the critical patients.

1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:38.300
Can you go to west Bundang?

1:32:38.550 --> 1:32:43.800
In Hae, don't worry.
I'm definitely going to get there.

1:32:57.050 --> 1:32:59.800
Hey, disconnect all equipments they use.

1:33:01.550 --> 1:33:05.300
Do it quickly.

1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:12.550
Hey you, stop right there.

1:33:14.300 --> 1:33:16.800
The child was not already dead?

1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:19.300
Give her to me.

1:33:19.550 --> 1:33:20.550
Don't touch her.

1:33:24.050 --> 1:33:26.300
Ji Goo are you there?

1:33:30.300 --> 1:33:31.800
Ji Goo...

1:33:35.050 --> 1:33:39.300
Elder brother, are you okay?

1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:43.550
Let's go!

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:47.050
Immediately cancel the evacuation,
And ask for more help from the outside.

1:33:47.300 --> 1:33:48.550
How many military forces can be deployed?

1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:51.550
Mr. President, Mr. President.
Can I have a moment with you?

1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:52.800
Not now Mr. Snyder.

1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:54.050
After this, give me a report.

1:33:54.050 --> 1:33:55.100
Dr. Yang.

1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:55.790
Yes.

1:33:55.800 --> 1:33:57.800
Is the antibodies out of Bundang?

1:33:58.050 --> 1:33:59.550
It's on it's way here,
I'm going out to make sure.

1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:01.300
We need to talk about this.

1:34:01.550 --> 1:34:03.800
It's not the right time,
There's more important to think about.

1:34:04.050 --> 1:34:07.050
We should talk about "Op Comm." protocol, Sir.

1:34:11.090 --> 1:34:15.090
"Basin pond" road is the boundary between
the isolation area and the western region

1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:24.300
Mom.

1:34:25.300 --> 1:34:26.800
Mi Reu, are you okay?

1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:29.300
Uncle.

1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:31.050
Mi Reu can talk now?

1:34:31.550 --> 1:34:33.800
Where's mom?

1:34:33.820 --> 1:34:35.820
Mom.

1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:39.050
Mom will come soon.

1:34:44.550 --> 1:34:49.300
Mom, I'm sorry.

1:34:49.550 --> 1:34:51.800
Don't talk now?

1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:54.300
I couldn't go home.

1:34:54.550 --> 1:34:56.550
You can't die.

1:35:09.050 --> 1:35:13.300
We need to go to Seoul
Let Seoul get infected as well.

1:35:13.550 --> 1:35:17.800
That way the government
would try to help us all.

1:35:18.050 --> 1:35:22.800
Let's go to Seoul.

1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:41.550
In Hae ...

1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:44.300
Mom, where are you?

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:02.050
How's the antibodies?

1:36:02.300 --> 1:36:07.550
The person who is the source
of antibody had died on the way.

1:36:07.550 --> 1:36:09.050
Sorry.

1:36:16.300 --> 1:36:18.800
Dr. Kim In Hae
Why do you say you want to go there?

1:36:19.050 --> 1:36:21.050
I lost my daughter, Mi Reu.

1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:22.800
So I had to go back to pick her up.

1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:25.050
No, you shouldn't be there.

1:36:25.300 --> 1:36:26.800
Mi Reu is still alive.

1:36:27.050 --> 1:36:29.300
Vaccination from the male survivor's
serum had produce antibodies.

1:36:29.550 --> 1:36:30.050
I will bring her here.

1:36:30.050 --> 1:36:32.050
Are you sure about that?

1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:35.550
I'm not sure,
But we can be sure she is still alive.

1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:37.050
I'm going to bring my daughter to you.

1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:40.050
Now is not the time.

1:36:40.300 --> 1:36:41.800
We do not know what
happened in Bundang today.

1:36:42.050 --> 1:36:49.800
Professor, my daughter is still
waiting for her mom to come.

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.800
I have to get there.

1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:09.550
But we lose the antibodies.

1:37:09.550 --> 1:37:13.050
You're not going to let
the virus out of the camp , are you?

1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:15.800
No.

1:37:16.050 --> 1:37:19.300
Then they have to sacrifice some
people to protect my country.

1:37:22.300 --> 1:37:24.800
You need to take action, now!.

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:42.800
Shooting is authorized.

1:37:43.050 --> 1:37:44.800
We will immediately defend the position.

1:37:45.050 --> 1:37:47.800
We can be sued for this ...

1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:53.300
Prepare to shoot!

1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:57.550
Aim to the target!

1:38:04.050 --> 1:38:08.050
Even if we have to be killed,
this is outrageous.

1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:13.550
You can see, I'm not infected.

1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:16.050
Please let me out of here.

1:38:41.050 --> 1:38:42.050
Snyder, did I order you to shoot?

1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:43.800
Are you crazy!

1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:45.550
Would you be willing to sacrifice the whole country

1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:47.550
for a gesture of compassion?

1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:50.550
But there's no reason ever to
shoot the innocent people!

1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:52.550
It's all under my command.

1:38:58.300 --> 1:38:59.550
Here!.

1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:00.550
How can I pass?

1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:02.300
Here fucker!

1:39:18.550 --> 1:39:21.300
Do you know what you're doing now?

1:39:21.550 --> 1:39:23.300
I know for sure.

1:39:23.550 --> 1:39:26.550
Do you think I'm doing all of
this because of mere desire?

1:39:26.550 --> 1:39:29.800
I also decided this with a heavy heart.

1:39:30.050 --> 1:39:32.800
You killed your own citizen.

1:39:33.050 --> 1:39:36.550
See this report, what do you think,
Is there is another solution?

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:41.550
The blockade in Bundang was originally 35%
and had increase to 96%

1:39:41.550 --> 1:39:43.550
Why all of this is like a drama on TV!

1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:46.050
Don't you think,
how this will be for our entire country?

1:39:46.300 --> 1:39:49.300
Would you still say no!

1:40:01.050 --> 1:40:02.550
Mom, are you okay?

1:40:08.550 --> 1:40:11.800
The lethal protocol that we discussed this morning.

1:40:12.550 --> 1:40:16.300
We got no option, we have to launch
operations "clean city", now!

1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:41.550
Mi Reu, uncle will be back soon.

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:42.800
Wait for uncle here, understand.

1:40:43.050 --> 1:40:46.300
Uncle don't go.

1:40:51.300 --> 1:40:56.550
Mi Reu, the people there
suffered,

1:40:56.550 --> 1:40:58.800
Uncle must help them.

1:40:59.050 --> 1:41:01.300
Uncle must because uncle a
member of rescue team?

1:41:03.050 --> 1:41:07.050
Uncle wanted to help
them, same as uncle help me?

1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:12.550
Whatever happens,
uncle will come back for Mi Reu.

1:41:12.550 --> 1:41:14.300
You have to believe in uncle.

1:41:15.550 --> 1:41:18.050
I will wait for my uncle here.

1:41:23.550 --> 1:41:26.050
Uncle will be back soon.

1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:29.300
Mi Reu know
how to use it.

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:32.800
Uncle have to go.

1:41:53.050 --> 1:41:56.800
Ji Goo...
Ji Goo...

1:41:57.050 --> 1:41:58.800
Mom.

1:42:00.550 --> 1:42:07.050
Mi Reu, Mi Reu, are you okay?

1:42:07.050 --> 1:42:11.800
Mom, I'm very scared,
hurry up to come here.

1:42:12.300 --> 1:42:16.300
Mom is quickly running there.

1:42:21.550 --> 1:42:24.300
This is a very critical condition,
quickly give an order to disarm them!

1:42:24.550 --> 1:42:28.050
This is an approval based on the provisions
of KOREA-US battle decisions.

1:42:28.050 --> 1:42:31.300
Please calm down sir, they say they
will be fully responsible for all this.

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:33.800
Wait.

1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:36.050
There is a little girl who had been
injected with the antibody,

1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:38.300
and is currently in Bundang.

1:42:38.550 --> 1:42:42.050
Doctors, you should have seen
the current situation in Bundang.

1:42:42.300 --> 1:42:44.300
Dr. Yang, follow me.

1:42:50.550 --> 1:42:52.300
This is a very dangerous battle zone!

1:42:52.550 --> 1:42:54.800
Please ...

1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:56.300
You are from the medical team, Kim In Hae?

1:42:59.050 --> 1:43:00.800
Please let me pass.

1:43:01.050 --> 1:43:02.300
My daughter is actually still alive.

1:43:02.550 --> 1:43:05.550
Are you sure you daughter
can produce antibodies?

1:43:05.800 --> 1:43:07.550
Yes, I'm sure.

1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:10.800
I personally injected the
serum and I heard her voice.

1:43:11.050 --> 1:43:16.800
Ji Goo, Bundang's Rescuers
Member is protecting my daughter.

1:43:17.050 --> 1:43:20.300
I have to go now.

1:43:36.550 --> 1:43:38.800
Kid, come here.

1:43:39.300 --> 1:43:40.800
Come here kid,

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:42.300
Come here.

1:43:43.050 --> 1:43:46.550
We must gather and keep walking forward.

1:43:48.050 --> 1:43:50.550
Yes, we can't go back again.

1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:53.550
This car can't pass through.

1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:56.300
Mi Reu ...

1:44:03.300 --> 1:44:05.550
Mi Reu ...

1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.800
Shut up kid ...

1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:12.120
Shut up!

1:44:13.450 --> 1:44:14.350
Shut up!

1:44:16.550 --> 1:44:18.800
Your blood is very useful for uncle.

1:44:19.050 --> 1:44:20.800
What are you doing to that child?

1:44:22.300 --> 1:44:23.550
Let go of the child.

1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:24.550
I do all this all,
so that everything can be saved.

1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:25.800
Get out there.

1:44:26.050 --> 1:44:27.800
You are just a person
who live just for yourself.

1:44:28.050 --> 1:44:30.800
It's only a little blood, damn it, get out!

1:44:36.300 --> 1:44:37.550
- Shoot
- Don't move

1:44:37.550 --> 1:44:39.300
- Shoot
- I told you, don't move

1:44:39.300 --> 1:44:43.800
Anyway, I couldn't survive,
Why don't you shoot me?

1:44:49.300 --> 1:44:50.800
Ji Goo, you hear me?

1:44:51.050 --> 1:44:52.050
Mi Reu ...

1:44:52.050 --> 1:44:53.550
You should not pass.

1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:55.550
Why now not allowed?

1:44:55.800 --> 1:44:57.050
The Commander reversed his decision.

1:44:57.300 --> 1:44:58.800
You don't believe me?

1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:01.490
Leave it all to me

1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:03.300
We have found the person
with antibodies!

1:45:03.550 --> 1:45:03.800
No way.

1:45:04.050 --> 1:45:05.800
I'm not going to be
sway by speculation,

1:45:06.050 --> 1:45:08.800
My duty is not just not to protect Korea,

1:45:09.050 --> 1:45:10.550
but to save guard the whole of the rest of the
world.

1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:12.050
You need to stop the operation,

1:45:12.300 --> 1:45:14.300
We found the antibodies, Snyder.

1:45:14.900 --> 1:45:15.500
Snyder!

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:26.300
Mi Reu ...

1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:29.550
Uncle!

1:45:31.050 --> 1:45:32.550
Get out.

1:46:25.550 --> 1:46:29.300
Defense Commander, I ordered
pre-emptive strikes against protestor.

1:46:29.300 --> 1:46:31.550
Anybody crossing the orange line.

1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:33.300
Shoot on sight.

1:46:35.050 --> 1:46:36.550
I want to pass.

1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:38.050
Doctor, you should not go there.

1:46:42.050 --> 1:46:47.300
Go and find the kid.
I'm fine.

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:51.050
Go on.

1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:53.300
I'll be right back.

1:46:56.300 --> 1:46:59.550
Mom ... mom ...

1:47:02.300 --> 1:47:05.550
Mi Reu ...

1:47:08.300 --> 1:47:12.550
Do not cross the orange line...

1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:14.300
If you want to get rid of us,
you have to shoot us, you bastard!

1:47:14.300 --> 1:47:16.550
Keep holding hands!

1:47:24.050 --> 1:47:27.050
Don't back down!

1:47:32.550 --> 1:47:34.300
Don't retreat ...

1:47:34.550 --> 1:47:36.800
Mom.

1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:39.300
Don't come here ...

1:47:39.550 --> 1:47:41.050
Doctor Kim,

1:47:41.300 --> 1:47:42.300
It that one of your doctor?

1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:43.390
Yes sir, Mr. President.

1:47:44.300 --> 1:47:47.800
Mom ... Mom ...

1:47:49.050 --> 1:47:50.800
Mi Reu ...

1:47:53.050 --> 1:47:59.550
Mom...

1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:03.800
Mi Reu ...

1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:11.300
Mom.

1:48:11.550 --> 1:48:19.800
Mi Reu.. Mi Reu...

1:48:24.050 --> 1:48:26.050
Do not come here.

1:48:30.800 --> 1:48:32.050
Shoot.

1:48:32.300 --> 1:48:33.050
No Captain.

1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.800
Quickly shoot!

1:48:37.050 --> 1:48:38.800
Mom...

1:48:39.050 --> 1:48:41.300
Don't come here Mi Reu ...

1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:19.120
Are you okay?

1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:23.800
Do not shoot my mom...

1:49:24.050 --> 1:49:28.050
- Don't shoot my mom ...
- Mi Reu

1:49:28.550 --> 1:49:29.800
No, it's too dangerous.

1:49:30.050 --> 1:49:33.050
Do not shoot my mom...

1:49:33.550 --> 1:49:49.550
Do not shoot my mom ...

1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:54.550
Mi Reu, child come here quickly.

1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.800
Mom.

1:50:01.550 --> 1:50:05.800
Come quickly, we can pass.

1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.800
Snyder, tell them to hold the fire.

1:50:29.550 --> 1:50:31.800
Commander, I'm the President

1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:34.300
Do not shoot. Do not shoot.

1:50:34.300 --> 1:50:36.300
Launch secondary strikes as planned

1:50:36.550 --> 1:50:38.800
Fighter bombers confirmed your position, please.

1:50:39.050 --> 1:50:39.800
What did you say?

1:50:40.050 --> 1:50:41.300
Fighter bombers!

1:50:41.550 --> 1:50:44.800
Just in case, the ROK army losses control on the ground.

1:50:45.050 --> 1:50:49.550
We scrambled two fighter bombers.

1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:51.300
South east of Bundang,

1:50:51.550 --> 1:50:52.800
Confirm the drop location.

1:50:53.050 --> 1:50:54.800
General, confirmed the location.

1:50:55.050 --> 1:50:55.800
Will do, Sir.

1:50:57.050 --> 1:50:58.550
What is this?

1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:03.050
Where is the child with antibodies?

1:51:08.050 --> 1:51:10.050
Mr. President please refer to the screen.

1:51:11.300 --> 1:51:13.800
That child. That child.

1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:16.300
Successfully recovered and survived.

1:51:16.550 --> 1:51:22.050
This child survived the deadly flu,
I saw it myself.

1:51:26.050 --> 1:51:27.800
How do we determine whether
the child has antibodies or not?

1:51:28.050 --> 1:51:29.800
First of all we must stop the assault.

1:51:30.050 --> 1:51:31.800
We have not been able to prove
whether the child's body has antibodies.

1:51:32.050 --> 1:51:33.300
So let's prove it.

1:51:34.050 --> 1:51:36.050
Secretary of State,
immediately contact the Defense Minister.

1:51:36.050 --> 1:51:41.800
Command to defend the capital
is under the President's jurisdiction, right?

1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:44.050
- Here...
- It connected, Sir...

1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:46.050
Defense Minister, this is the President.

1:51:46.300 --> 1:51:47.800
I am the Secretary of State Defense,
what can I do for you, Mr. President?

1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:50.050
Prepare anti - aircraft missiles

1:51:50.050 --> 1:51:52.800
If you see any air crafts over the
sky of Bundang, immediately shoot it down.

1:51:53.050 --> 1:51:54.800
This is unacceptable.

1:51:54.800 --> 1:51:57.550
You have no authority
to countermand my order ...

1:51:57.800 --> 1:52:00.800
Those people, they are my people.

1:52:02.050 --> 1:52:05.550
Sir, I officially demand you withdraw your order.

1:52:06.300 --> 1:52:09.050
Synder, I officially warn you,

1:52:09.300 --> 1:52:11.300
I will shoot them down.

1:52:14.550 --> 1:52:19.550
All citizens, please go.

1:52:23.050 --> 1:52:25.550
I got eyes on the target.
I got eyes on the target.

1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:27.800
Snyder, We're ready to strike the target.

1:52:28.050 --> 1:52:30.550
Target locked, confirmation to fire.

1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:33.800
Mr. Presidential the air crafts has
entered the missile's shooting range.

1:52:36.300 --> 1:52:37.800
Get ready to launch.

1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:52.300
General.

1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:05.300
Mission Aborted.

1:53:05.550 --> 1:53:07.050
All birds return to the bird farm.

1:53:10.300 --> 1:53:13.550
Residents of Bundang, this Korea's President.

1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:19.050
No matter what the circumstances,
the government will not abandon you.

1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:22.300
We have canceled all air strikes.

1:53:22.550 --> 1:53:24.050
Then we can survive.

1:53:24.300 --> 1:53:26.550
From now on you can feel at ease,

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:29.550
Please wait there.

1:53:30.300 --> 1:53:32.300
Soon we will send relief vehicles for you.

1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:42.050
Mom....

1:53:54.050 --> 1:53:56.550
Mr. President, you give me no option, but to register

1:53:56.800 --> 1:53:59.300
the strongest possible complaint with the allies.

1:53:59.550 --> 1:54:01.050
I know.

1:54:03.300 --> 1:54:06.550
If the girl doesn't carry antibodies,

1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:09.050
I'll take full responsibility.

1:54:16.550 --> 1:54:18.550
Come, open Bundang's blockage.

1:54:19.050 --> 1:54:22.050
Contact the existing hospital
and send rescuers.

1:54:39.550 --> 1:54:41.300
Thank you.

1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:48.050
I'm really grateful.

1:54:51.050 --> 1:54:55.800
Oh, I've never heard the
like of this so far.

1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:59.550
My situation became
better after hearing that.

1:55:02.550 --> 1:55:05.800
Mi Reu, give thanks to uncle.

1:55:07.050 --> 1:55:08.550
Quickly.

1:55:08.550 --> 1:55:10.050
Geez ...

1:55:10.300 --> 1:55:13.300
Thank you, uncle.

1:55:24.300 --> 1:55:25.800
Brother,

1:55:27.550 --> 1:55:29.300
Are you okay?

1:55:30.050 --> 1:55:32.300
You look fine.

1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:35.050
That man almost killed me.

1:55:35.050 --> 1:55:38.050
Your really have a long life span.

1:55:40.050 --> 1:55:43.050
Come follow me,
My breath started wheezing.

1:55:43.050 --> 1:55:45.300
- You go first
- You're really a braggart

1:55:45.300 --> 1:55:46.550
I'll catch up with you soon.

1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:49.800
I know, quickly close it.

1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:04.050
Although mom wanted to come along,
but now it's not possible.

1:56:06.050 --> 1:56:10.050
Professor, please take care of  Mi Reu.

1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:13.300
Do not worry, I will take care
of her as well as possible.

1:56:13.550 --> 1:56:15.550
The result will be out soon.

1:56:16.050 --> 1:56:18.050
Can you go alone?

1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:27.800
Mi Reu, you're there to
help the lives of many people.

1:56:28.050 --> 1:56:30.050
Do you understand?

1:56:36.550 --> 1:56:38.800
Go.

1:56:39.300 --> 1:56:46.300
Uncle would be fine with my mom right?

1:56:49.300 --> 1:56:51.300
Sure.

1:57:29.050 --> 1:57:32.050
Outbreak Prevention Division, today

1:57:32.300 --> 1:57:36.300
Kim Mi Reu, is the owner of the antibodies.

1:57:36.550 --> 1:57:40.050
The government will immediately implement
research and produce these antibodies

1:57:40.300 --> 1:57:44.300
and prioritized Bundang's residents.
