00:05.799 --> 00:08.551
<i>Unscheduled incoming traveller.</i>

00:13.316 --> 00:15.189
There's no one scheduled.

00:15.234 --> 00:17.806
- Did you get an iris code?
- Yes, sir. From SG-1.

00:22.269 --> 00:23.812
Hi. How are you?

00:23.868 --> 00:27.783
The only other person
with an SG-1 remote and its signal...

00:27.746 --> 00:31.114
- Tek-matte Bra'tac.
- But he'd only use it in an emergency.

00:31.103 --> 00:35.515
- Perhaps he is under attack.
- By who? Apophis and Klorel were killed.

00:35.462 --> 00:37.287
Open the iris.

00:52.131 --> 00:56.543
Hammond of Texas, will you give me
leave to enter your compound?

00:56.850 --> 00:58.889
You have it, Master Bra'tac.

00:58.929 --> 01:00.968
Units, stand down.

01:06.444 --> 01:08.769
Bra'tac, greetings from Earth.

01:09.242 --> 01:10.865
Hmm! Hasshak.

01:11.801 --> 01:15.465
I take it this isn't a... social call.

01:17.397 --> 01:19.353
Greetings, old friend.

01:19.394 --> 01:21.304
I bring bad news.

01:21.355 --> 01:24.390
- My family!
- Your wife is safe.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.161
- What of Rya'c?
- Your son has been taken.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.188
By Apophis.

02:37.430 --> 02:41.427
Colonel, your report stated that
Apophis was killed on board his ship.

02:41.388 --> 02:44.721
Yes, it did, sir.
We saw the thing blow.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.864
Nobody could have survived, sir.

02:46.905 --> 02:50.272
I am told he and Klorel escaped
via the on-board Stargate...

02:50.263 --> 02:52.088
...before the ship blew up.

02:52.141 --> 02:54.975
They must have used those rings
to get to the gate.

02:54.979 --> 02:57.849
What does Apophis gain
by kidnapping Teal'c's son?

02:57.858 --> 03:00.098
<i>He does not want Rya'c.</i>

03:00.455 --> 03:03.206
He wants the ShoI'va, the traitor.

03:03.774 --> 03:05.599
And he wants Teal'c.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.444
Teal'c is right.

03:07.492 --> 03:11.703
Nearly all the warriors and serpent guards
loyal to Apophis died on those ships.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.973
Apophis returned to Chulak in shame.

03:15.288 --> 03:18.204
He must act quickly
to reinstate his power,...

03:18.205 --> 03:22.368
...or another Goa'uld will be sent
to eliminate him and rule in his place.

03:22.324 --> 03:25.324
Right now, there is
a measure of chaos in Chulak.

03:25.322 --> 03:27.314
His guard is weakened.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.479
If we use this time wisely,
we can rescue the boy.

03:30.479 --> 03:34.393
I can't allow my best people
to walk into what is obviously a trap.

03:34.356 --> 03:35.899
Of course it's a trap.

03:36.956 --> 03:39.197
And in knowing that, we can avoid it.

03:41.074 --> 03:44.026
- He's vulnerable now.
- He never will be more so.

03:44.871 --> 03:48.819
And I have friends in the serpent guards
Apophis does not know of.

03:49.586 --> 03:51.663
If we can pull this off, sir,...

03:51.706 --> 03:53.864
...we can grab Teal'c's kid...

03:53.905 --> 03:55.944
...and nail this mother...

03:56.424 --> 03:58.462
...Goa'uld in one sweep.

04:01.939 --> 04:05.604
Teal'c, you originally withheld information
about your family...

04:05.578 --> 04:08.329
...because you feared
it would make you vulnerable.

04:08.657 --> 04:10.364
Well, it has.

04:10.414 --> 04:12.122
This must be the last time.

04:13.573 --> 04:15.530
So, Colonel, you have a go.

04:15.573 --> 04:17.862
Get Apophis if you can,...

04:17.891 --> 04:22.468
...but your prime directive
is to bring Teal'c's family back to Earth.

04:22.408 --> 04:23.523
Yes, sir.

05:05.663 --> 05:07.869
<i>This is our destination.</i>

05:08.382 --> 05:10.420
<i>Who lives here?</i>

05:10.459 --> 05:13.459
Drey'auc has offered her new home
as a base.

05:13.459 --> 05:16.079
<i>But how could
she afford such a home?</i>

05:18.175 --> 05:20.214
I do not know.

05:39.723 --> 05:41.550
Teal'c?

05:50.875 --> 05:52.915
I was alone when they came.

05:52.954 --> 05:54.994
I tried to stop them.

05:55.632 --> 05:57.875
Of this I am certain.

05:57.911 --> 05:59.536
Teal'c!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.737
Master Bra'tac!

06:03.788 --> 06:05.947
You are the warriors from the Tauri.

06:07.187 --> 06:11.018
I have heard much of you.
I am Fro'tak of the High Cliffs.

06:10.985 --> 06:13.024
Jack of the Windy City.

06:13.463 --> 06:15.502
This is Jackson and Carter.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.699
My thanks for your coming.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.990
Your presence in the home of my wife
is appreciated, Fro'tak.

06:22.617 --> 06:24.656
It is my home, Teal'c.

06:25.975 --> 06:28.466
You provided shelter for my wife and son.

06:28.495 --> 06:29.822
Teal'c...

06:30.252 --> 06:32.292
I will tell him.

06:33.170 --> 06:37.749
When it appeared that you may never
return, that you may indeed be dead,...

06:41.326 --> 06:43.533
...Drey'auc had her marriage removed.

06:48.762 --> 06:50.802
<i>She is now my wife, Teal'c.</i>

06:54.519 --> 06:55.300
My God!

06:55.399 --> 06:57.639
Hey, knock it off! Come on, come on!

06:57.677 --> 07:00.843
Knock it off! You came here for your son.
This doesn't help.

07:06.151 --> 07:08.723
I wished to tell you myself, old friend.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.911
I am sorry.

07:15.625 --> 07:18.875
How could you not have known this,
Bra'tac?

07:20.423 --> 07:24.752
We will wait outside,
and give you time to sort through this...

07:24.701 --> 07:26.740
...uncomfortable news.

07:31.976 --> 07:34.762
Captain Carter,
why don't you go with them?

07:34.776 --> 07:38.723
- See what you can find out about the kid.
- Yes, sir.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.963
Teal'c,...

07:44.009 --> 07:47.377
...on my word as a warrior,
I did not know.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.487
If I had, I would have told you
before we arrived.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.620
I just want to know if this Fro'tak
can be trusted not to turn us in.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.639
Is it not obvious, O'Neill?

08:02.677 --> 08:05.927
- He cannot be trusted.
- Well, no offence, Teal'c,...

08:05.916 --> 08:08.372
...but that view is not born of a cool head.

08:10.514 --> 08:14.841
- What do you think, Bra'tac?
- He is one of Teal'c's oldest confidants.

08:14.791 --> 08:17.994
Both were my wards
in the Bashaak training.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.694
He has indicated
he agrees with my beliefs...

08:20.707 --> 08:22.829
...that the Goa'ulds are false gods.

08:23.266 --> 08:25.721
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can he be trusted?

08:25.745 --> 08:27.785
I believe so, yes.

08:27.822 --> 08:30.658
But I suggest we keep
a close eye on him at all times.

08:30.661 --> 08:34.908
- A better response would be to kill him.
- Teal'c! You cannot.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.187
<i>Teal'c...</i>

08:37.618 --> 08:40.404
Look, you probably
don't want to hear this now,...

08:40.414 --> 08:42.907
...but you need to get
some perspective on this.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.972
Maybe you should be thanking him.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.313
How can you say that, Daniel Jackson?

08:48.331 --> 08:50.787
He has betrayed our friendship.

08:50.809 --> 08:53.182
If I recall, last time we were here,...

08:53.209 --> 08:57.418
...you were pretty upset about
your family being outcasts,...

08:57.365 --> 09:00.735
...barely surviving in a camp
because of what you did.

09:00.724 --> 09:03.048
It seems to me they have a better life now.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.559
Teal'c, listen to me.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.383
If you were dead, would you wish
Drey'auc to remain alone for ever?

09:13.356 --> 09:16.690
- I am not dead.
- In your current state you may as well be.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.880
How long before you return
to care for her?

09:18.913 --> 09:22.447
- You know I cannot answer this.
- Yes. As does she.

09:22.672 --> 09:24.711
Dr. Jackson is right.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.419
Fro'tak has high station in Chulak.

09:28.227 --> 09:31.725
Thanks to him,
your family is no longer outcast.

09:32.825 --> 09:34.864
Teal'c, I know it's tough,...

09:34.903 --> 09:37.359
...but you've got to focus on your boy.

09:37.383 --> 09:39.338
Before we proceed,...

09:39.380 --> 09:42.335
...give me your word
you will not commit Kel Mar Tokeem.

09:45.577 --> 09:47.616
I give you my word.

09:50.775 --> 09:53.692
Then I will retrieve
Fro'tak and your wife,...

09:53.693 --> 09:57.736
...and we will begin planning
for the rescue of your son.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.607
Del Mar Hokeem?

10:03.447 --> 10:06.731
That means something like
"revenge by the wearer of horns."

10:06.725 --> 10:10.177
Which I'm guessing is
a Jaffa term for being a cuckold.

10:10.163 --> 10:11.195
Hello!

10:21.155 --> 10:23.860
We will find Rya'c and bring him home.

10:24.713 --> 10:26.754
This I swear.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.817
Thank you, Teal'c.

10:30.350 --> 10:32.389
After that is done,...

10:34.269 --> 10:36.889
...I will never lay eyes on you again.

11:07.927 --> 11:09.967
How dare you judge me...

11:11.206 --> 11:14.456
...and dishonour Fro'tak
in his own house...

11:14.445 --> 11:16.437
...after what you have done?

11:16.484 --> 11:19.602
- Woman, be silent.
- That is not an answer, Teal'c!

11:19.601 --> 11:22.092
<i>You were the one who abandoned us.</i>

11:23.081 --> 11:27.871
- What I did was for my people's future.
- What I have done is for that of our son!

11:30.796 --> 11:32.289
Perhaps.

11:35.073 --> 11:38.489
- But why Fro'tak?
- He was the only one who asked.

11:38.471 --> 11:40.297
Do you have love for him?

11:44.109 --> 11:46.148
Do you have love for him?

11:50.345 --> 11:52.384
No, Teal'c.

11:52.744 --> 11:56.955
But Rya'c, our son,
deserves a better life than the camps.

11:58.778 --> 12:01.019
And Fro'tak has offered it to him.

12:15.889 --> 12:18.972
Rya'c is held in the west wing
of the palace where I work.

12:18.967 --> 12:22.963
It is less than 200 paces away.
I know it well. I have made a map.

12:22.926 --> 12:24.751
This is the main corridor.

12:24.803 --> 12:28.005
My place of work is here,
in the Hall of Recording.

12:28.001 --> 12:31.583
- The guarded room is here.
- There is an entrance near it,...

12:31.561 --> 12:33.967
...used only for
the changing of the guard.

12:33.999 --> 12:36.405
The west wing
is the most isolated sector.

12:36.437 --> 12:39.557
So we should be able to
get in and out pretty quickly.

12:40.394 --> 12:42.433
We go as soon as it's dark.

13:01.503 --> 13:02.961
Jaffa, kree!

13:03.020 --> 13:05.059
Tel rak nel t'ko!

13:24.450 --> 13:25.398
Clear!

13:39.280 --> 13:42.980
- Help, guards! Help me!
- Do not be afraid, Rya'c. You are safe.

13:42.957 --> 13:45.245
- Get away from me!
- What is he doing?

13:45.275 --> 13:47.067
Guards! The traitor's here!

13:47.115 --> 13:49.154
<i>- Help!
- Silence!</i>

13:55.030 --> 13:56.441
We're outta here!

13:59.227 --> 14:00.851
Teal'c!

14:38.325 --> 14:40.364
What happened?

14:40.404 --> 14:42.111
Where is my son?

14:42.163 --> 14:44.866
He's all right.
We just ran into some problems.

14:44.881 --> 14:46.837
It is far worse than that.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.385
Rya'c's body lives,
but his mind is destroyed.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.182
What are you saying?

14:54.235 --> 14:56.227
He is now with Apophis.

14:56.274 --> 14:58.480
The boy was a stranger. A beast!

14:58.514 --> 15:02.297
Oh, come on! The kid's brainwashed.

15:02.272 --> 15:06.138
You promised...
you would bring him home!

15:06.110 --> 15:08.149
Hear me, woman.

15:08.869 --> 15:14.158
He called me traitor and ran to the guards.
Apophis is punishing me for my betrayal.

15:17.581 --> 15:19.620
But he's... just a child.

15:19.661 --> 15:21.321
<i>My child!</i>

15:23.498 --> 15:27.115
You cannot feel more contempt for me
than I hold for myself.

15:36.451 --> 15:38.775
This was not your doing, Teal'c.

15:43.886 --> 15:45.427
What's going on?

15:45.486 --> 15:48.522
Apophis is about to address
the people of Chulak.

15:48.524 --> 15:50.647
That should be interesting!

15:55.161 --> 15:57.448
<i>People of Chulak,...</i>

15:57.479 --> 15:59.684
<i>.. rumours of my defeat are false,...</i>

15:59.716 --> 16:02.669
<i>.. spread by traitors
who would destroy our world.</i>

16:02.674 --> 16:04.714
<i>I bring you the truth,...</i>

16:04.754 --> 16:09.414
<i>.. proof of my power to conquer evil
and forgive transgression.</i>

16:10.350 --> 16:12.259
<i>Witness...</i>

16:12.309 --> 16:14.349
<i>.. my most loyal subject...</i>

16:16.187 --> 16:18.225
<i>Rya'c, son of Teal'c!</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:21.184
<i>My father is not a hero.</i>

16:21.225 --> 16:23.383
<i>He is evil.</i>

16:23.423 --> 16:26.588
<i>He turned away from our God,
our people,...</i>

16:26.581 --> 16:28.620
<i>.. even his own family.</i>

16:29.061 --> 16:31.100
<i>He is a Ha'taaka!</i>

16:31.979 --> 16:35.927
<i>My people, this Ha'taaka
is now among us, here in Chulak.</i>

16:35.897 --> 16:40.273
<i>I will give one million shesh'ta to the Jaffa
who brings Teal'c to me alive...</i>

16:40.213 --> 16:43.332
<i>.. and another million
for the heads of those with him.</i>

16:43.331 --> 16:46.498
If you've got a price on your head
you're doing your job!

16:46.490 --> 16:48.528
<i>The evil ones have my mother.</i>

16:48.567 --> 16:50.773
<i>She is their prisoner.</i>

16:50.807 --> 16:53.095
<i>Help us save her.</i>

16:53.125 --> 16:56.245
<i>My mother is Drey'auc
of the Morning Cham'ka Groves.</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:02.039
This was to be expected.

17:02.081 --> 17:05.663
What was that about us having
his mother? No one took Drey'auc.

17:05.637 --> 17:07.675
You are correct, Daniel Jackson.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.316
Rya'c has given me hope.

17:10.355 --> 17:12.262
Perhaps my son is not lost to me.

17:12.314 --> 17:16.181
- Where do you get that?
- He is fighting this brainwashing.

17:16.153 --> 17:18.477
His last words were
a hidden message to me.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.549
About us holding his mother?

17:20.589 --> 17:23.126
He said Drey'auc
of the Morning Cham'ka Groves.

17:23.147 --> 17:25.982
But I am of the Cord'ai Plains.
Rya'c knows this.

17:25.987 --> 17:30.613
Only too well. In the past I have taken him
to the Cham'ka Groves to play.

17:30.545 --> 17:32.833
He wants us to go there in the morning.

17:32.862 --> 17:34.902
He has given us a way to free him.

17:34.942 --> 17:37.017
Teal'c, I know he is your son,...

17:37.378 --> 17:40.084
...but this is a wisdom
far beyond his years.

17:40.097 --> 17:42.634
<i>I'm kind of with Bra'tac
on this one.</i>

17:42.656 --> 17:45.905
The boy had a chance to come with us
the first time.

17:45.894 --> 17:49.972
- I kinda think it's wishful thinking.
- It is not wishful thinking!

17:49.932 --> 17:53.882
My son is strong. He is fighting
this brainwashing you spoke of.

17:54.368 --> 17:57.286
It has simply taken him this long
to win the battle.

18:01.924 --> 18:03.963
Expecting someone?

18:13.638 --> 18:17.054
We have orders to search
for the traitor and his friends.

18:17.037 --> 18:19.076
Hurry! This way.

18:26.391 --> 18:30.849
The criminals have abducted my wife!
It makes no sense that they'd be here.

18:30.788 --> 18:33.029
You are welcome to enter,...

18:33.067 --> 18:35.105
...but Apophis would be very angry...

18:35.145 --> 18:38.311
...that you wasted time
searching the home of the victim!

18:38.304 --> 18:40.343
This is done by his order.

18:40.382 --> 18:41.792
Quickly!

18:43.259 --> 18:44.256
There!

19:10.765 --> 19:12.590
Next house.

19:32.392 --> 19:34.762
Until this moment, Fro'tak,...

19:35.309 --> 19:37.846
...I was not certain you could be trusted.

19:37.867 --> 19:39.906
We are old friends, Teal'c.

19:40.905 --> 19:43.396
I hope you never lose your trust in me.

20:18.404 --> 20:20.396
I will not sleep either.

20:25.401 --> 20:27.606
Until our son is safe.

21:13.971 --> 21:16.010
Guard!

21:18.170 --> 21:21.585
I will lead you to the traitor Teal'c
and his companions.

21:29.803 --> 21:31.426
Don't!

21:35.039 --> 21:36.700
Shut up!

21:36.759 --> 21:40.756
It does not have to go down like this!
Nice and quiet.

21:44.634 --> 21:46.127
Come on.

21:46.192 --> 21:48.230
Jaffa!

22:01.344 --> 22:04.428
Seal off the palace.
No one comes or goes!

22:38.922 --> 22:43.167
How dare you enter like this!
This house has already been searched.

22:47.397 --> 22:49.970
No wonder these guys are always cranky.

22:52.993 --> 22:54.737
Get me out of this thing.

22:54.792 --> 22:55.954
Jack,...

22:56.031 --> 22:58.273
...where the hell have you been?

23:02.307 --> 23:04.134
What of Fro'tak?

23:09.345 --> 23:13.093
He left here last night
and made a beeline for the palace.

23:13.061 --> 23:15.101
He was turning us in.

23:15.141 --> 23:17.383
I had to stop him.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.910
- I'm sorry.
- I never thought he would betray us.

23:19.938 --> 23:21.846
<i>The fault is mine.</i>

23:24.295 --> 23:26.334
I made vows I could not keep.

23:48.401 --> 23:50.440
The suns are coming up.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.435
Let's get the kid.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.772
All right, listen up.
This cannot be a fire-fight.

24:04.751 --> 24:07.159
We go CTT, one shot,
one kill, my command.

24:07.191 --> 24:09.858
<i>Take the target nearest your position.</i>

24:21.181 --> 24:22.176
Go!

24:30.855 --> 24:32.894
- Father!
- Rya'c!

24:33.973 --> 24:36.429
I never meant to hurt you, Father.

24:41.769 --> 24:43.808
Rya'c has returned.

24:43.848 --> 24:46.385
Don't you think this was a little too easy?

24:46.407 --> 24:49.028
Yeah, that was an awfully fast turnaround.

24:49.046 --> 24:53.872
My son is strong. His mind has overcome
the lies Apophis placed there.

24:53.802 --> 24:57.218
Then you won't mind
if Carter does a little search...

25:07.314 --> 25:09.390
I think he's clean, Colonel.

25:10.992 --> 25:14.527
If this were not Rya'c returned,
this would have been a trap.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.502
- It was not.
- Not yet.

25:16.548 --> 25:18.458
Why do you doubt my son?

25:18.508 --> 25:22.125
It's my nature, Teal'c.
I'm thinking Cassandra here.

25:22.105 --> 25:24.976
A little bomb in the chest,
get through the gate, boom!

25:24.984 --> 25:26.941
My son is Jaffa.

25:26.982 --> 25:29.651
His symbiote
would not allow such tampering.

25:29.661 --> 25:32.032
Is that a fact... or a hope?

25:32.059 --> 25:33.969
It is a fact, O'Neill.

25:35.538 --> 25:39.369
Well, it's not like we have much choice.
Let's get a move on.

25:39.615 --> 25:43.150
Go directly to the Stargate.
I will bring the boy's mother.

25:50.288 --> 25:53.324
<i>I don't know, sir.
I'm not liking this one bit.</i>

25:53.727 --> 25:55.766
Talk about too easy!

25:58.644 --> 26:00.682
Rya'c!

26:05.599 --> 26:07.924
Father's taking us to the Tauri!

26:18.432 --> 26:20.471
All right, come here.

26:21.872 --> 26:25.287
All right, Rya'c... What's the scam here?

26:26.387 --> 26:29.138
- I do not understand.
- What are you up to?

26:30.105 --> 26:32.144
Or better yet,...

26:32.184 --> 26:34.391
...what has Apophis got you up to?

26:34.423 --> 26:36.380
I fooled Apophis.

26:36.422 --> 26:37.915
Yeah?

26:37.980 --> 26:40.554
Then why the tantrum
when we came the first time?

26:41.897 --> 26:46.060
At the time I was not yet successful
in defeating Apophis's control.

26:46.016 --> 26:49.017
I am sorry.
My mind is not as strong as my father's.

26:49.015 --> 26:52.383
O'Neill, why can you not
accept the possibility...

26:52.372 --> 26:55.575
...that my son's mind was too strong
for Apophis to control?

26:57.369 --> 26:58.483
Come here.

27:05.484 --> 27:08.935
Teal'c, I want you to be right,
but it just doesn't track.

27:08.923 --> 27:12.125
Apophis knows we're here,
and has only two guards at the gate.

27:13.281 --> 27:16.115
Apophis has few serpent guards
still loyal to him.

27:16.118 --> 27:19.986
In two days we have killed many of those.
Perhaps he cannot spare more.

27:19.957 --> 27:23.289
Even if this is a trick,
what are we gonna do? Just stay here?

27:23.634 --> 27:25.507
Daniel has a point.

27:25.553 --> 27:28.588
We may as well take on the guard
and get through the gate.

27:28.590 --> 27:29.919
What about the boy?

27:30.630 --> 27:34.542
My son will not harm your world, O'Neill.
I give you my word.

27:34.508 --> 27:36.962
Teal'c, I know you mean that.

27:36.986 --> 27:39.144
But it might not prove to be that easy.

27:40.865 --> 27:43.105
So are we gonna just leave the boy here?

27:52.057 --> 27:54.548
Bra'tac, stay here
with Drey'auc and the boy.

27:55.855 --> 27:57.645
We'll clear the way.

28:49.023 --> 28:51.063
<i>Let's go. Everybody, move!</i>

28:55.060 --> 28:56.056
Clear.

29:01.176 --> 29:03.797
It's OK. You're perfectly safe. Come on.

29:19.526 --> 29:21.565
Join us, old friend.

29:21.605 --> 29:23.265
Another time.

29:23.324 --> 29:26.773
- Once again I owe you my thanks.
- You owe me nothing.

29:26.762 --> 29:29.252
You have made an old teacher proud.

30:01.940 --> 30:04.608
Well, no sign of anything abnormaI.

30:04.618 --> 30:07.820
Not that I'm an expert in
what's normal for a Jaffa his age.

30:07.817 --> 30:09.856
No sign of a bomb in his belly?

30:09.895 --> 30:12.766
None. As Teal'c says,
I doubt it would work in a Jaffa.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.723
Now do you see, O'Neill? All is well.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.771
Yeah, I hope so, Teal'c.

30:19.090 --> 30:21.130
But I still want a guard on him.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.913
I would do the same.

30:23.969 --> 30:26.092
Father says Tauri only has one sun.

30:26.126 --> 30:28.748
<i>I cannot wait to see it!</i>

30:28.765 --> 30:30.804
When will I be able to see it?

30:30.844 --> 30:34.176
It will be a while, my son.
You must be patient.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.752
Something troubles you.

30:49.791 --> 30:51.830
Before our son was taken,...

30:53.030 --> 30:55.700
...he was training with Master Bra'tac.

30:55.709 --> 30:57.748
He lost two teeth that day.

30:59.027 --> 31:01.066
They are no longer missing.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.782
Dr. Fraiser?

31:14.138 --> 31:16.924
So, um,... Rya'c...

31:17.376 --> 31:19.415
What kind of food do you like?

31:19.454 --> 31:22.455
I am not hungry.
I wish to see the outside of your world.

31:22.453 --> 31:24.244
Plenty of time for that.

31:24.292 --> 31:26.285
Colonel?

31:26.332 --> 31:28.371
We'll get to it.

31:29.209 --> 31:33.075
Rya'c, um... I'm gonna take
a little blood sample.

31:33.047 --> 31:37.125
Then we'll be finished.
You'll feel a tiny sting, but that's all.

31:37.084 --> 31:38.542
No!

31:38.604 --> 31:42.647
You dare touch me, Ha'taaka!
I'll kill you all!

31:42.601 --> 31:44.224
Do it quickly.

32:07.788 --> 32:08.782
Rya'c...

32:14.383 --> 32:16.422
Go away! I hate you!

32:18.740 --> 32:19.938
Rya'c!

32:20.738 --> 32:22.777
<i>You cannot stop me!</i>

32:25.776 --> 32:27.269
They're gone, son.

32:27.335 --> 32:30.288
I hate you! No, I want Apophis!

32:30.294 --> 32:33.460
<i>I hate you! I hate you! Let me out!</i>

32:33.451 --> 32:35.692
What the hell almost happened here?

32:35.730 --> 32:37.769
The teeth were fake, hollow.

32:37.808 --> 32:41.971
Inside each tooth we found
a different organism, sort of like a virus.

32:41.925 --> 32:45.009
They both appear to be
dormant, harmless,...

32:45.005 --> 32:48.503
...until you combine them.
Then they become deadly.

32:48.483 --> 32:51.105
If he bit down hard enough
to break the teeth...

32:51.122 --> 32:53.955
...the organisms would
combine and multiply,...

32:53.961 --> 32:56.083
...and be released into the atmosphere.

32:56.117 --> 32:58.156
So that's why he wanted to get outside.

32:59.836 --> 33:04.249
- Kinda sounds like anthrax.
- It makes anthrax look like a cold virus.

33:06.590 --> 33:11.382
It would have taken less than two days
for it to spread across North America.

33:11.309 --> 33:13.765
Less than a week
to spread around the world.

33:14.787 --> 33:16.826
And what would it have done?

33:16.865 --> 33:20.115
Killed every living thing
within 24 hours of contact.

33:21.663 --> 33:25.196
Could the boy have another device
implanted in his body?

33:25.181 --> 33:29.011
X-rays and CAT scans were negative.
All other tests were normal.

33:29.378 --> 33:32.296
<i>OK, so... we're all right.</i>

33:32.297 --> 33:36.127
Rya'c is all right. We just have to
get his mind back. How do we do that?

33:38.733 --> 33:40.940
Deprogramming.

33:40.972 --> 33:45.846
It's... not exactly the kind of thing
you want to put a kid through.

33:45.769 --> 33:49.137
From the time of birth
all Jaffa are taught to be strong.

33:49.126 --> 33:51.165
Rya'c is my son.

33:51.207 --> 33:53.246
He can withstand it.

33:54.843 --> 33:57.961
<i>You cannot keep me here!
Return me to Chulak, Ha'taaka!</i>

33:58.201 --> 34:01.734
<i>I hate you! You're Shol'va! I hate you!</i>

34:01.719 --> 34:05.003
<i>You messed up my life!
Return me to Apophis!</i>

34:04.998 --> 34:08.246
<i>I hate you!
Let me go, you cannot keep me here!</i>

34:09.235 --> 34:11.108
Return me to Chulak, Ha'taaka!

34:11.152 --> 34:14.936
- We will not.
- Then go! I wish never to see you again!

34:20.748 --> 34:24.114
<i>- Apophis is a false God.
- Apophis is my God.</i>

34:24.106 --> 34:27.143
- Then who am I, my son?
- The traitor. The vile one.

34:27.146 --> 34:29.849
I am your father
and I have much love for you.

34:29.864 --> 34:31.487
My God loves me!

34:34.219 --> 34:37.219
If he loves you, why did he ask
that you destroy yourself?

34:37.219 --> 34:41.085
- Let me sleep!
- Why did he ask you to destroy yourself?

34:41.056 --> 34:43.891
You are stupid!
I told you, I would not have died.

34:43.893 --> 34:48.021
You are flesh and blood as I am, my son.
Apophis lied to you.

34:47.971 --> 34:49.215
You lie!

34:49.291 --> 34:52.244
You said you would come back.
But you never did!

35:12.476 --> 35:14.516
<i>I must return to Apophis!</i>

35:15.036 --> 35:17.074
For what reason?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.570
Because he loves me and I love him.

35:21.233 --> 35:23.273
Rya'c,...

35:23.311 --> 35:25.304
...my son,...

35:25.349 --> 35:26.677
...hear me.

35:29.829 --> 35:32.699
You must remember
when we were a family.

35:36.342 --> 35:40.291
Remember how you loved the satta-cakes
your mother made for you?

35:47.257 --> 35:51.420
Remember the stories we told
by the fire at night,...

35:51.375 --> 35:53.331
...and how we laughed together?

35:55.213 --> 35:56.623
Rya'c,...

35:56.692 --> 35:58.731
...my son,...

35:59.530 --> 36:01.570
...that is love.

36:36.509 --> 36:40.836
He has reason to hate me, which only
strengthens the twisting of his mind.

36:44.782 --> 36:46.822
Do you know of another way?

36:48.141 --> 36:49.552
ECT.

36:51.099 --> 36:52.297
Maybe.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.536
What is this ECT?

36:55.896 --> 36:57.936
Electroconvulsive therapy.

36:57.976 --> 37:00.300
Whoa! Electroshock?

37:00.335 --> 37:02.824
Isn't that kind of... barbaric?

37:02.853 --> 37:07.728
Not so much any more. It's done under
anaesthesia in a more controlled way.

37:07.650 --> 37:12.061
I just don't know about using it on a child,
or for that matter a Jaffa.

37:12.007 --> 37:14.626
It could kill the Goa'uld larva inside him.

37:14.646 --> 37:16.684
That would kill Rya'c.

37:17.963 --> 37:22.126
This ECT...
is it similar to a zat'n'ktel discharge?

37:23.481 --> 37:25.806
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

37:25.838 --> 37:30.795
A single discharge will not kill a Jaffa
of any age, nor the symbiote within.

37:31.036 --> 37:32.447
Might work.

37:35.512 --> 37:37.552
It will cause him great pain.

37:42.268 --> 37:44.344
I trust you know what is best.

38:13.610 --> 38:16.563
Rya'c,... you must arise.

38:16.969 --> 38:19.007
Your mother is here to help you.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.873
I hate her. I want Apophis!

38:27.563 --> 38:29.601
Forgive me, my son.

38:40.356 --> 38:41.980
Aaagh!

38:55.186 --> 38:57.344
He barely draws breath.

38:58.143 --> 39:00.182
He is in great pain.

39:04.382 --> 39:07.583
There is an ancient song
you used to soothe him as a baby.

39:13.177 --> 39:18.300
# Kel ma kree, Sha'shan

39:18.213 --> 39:21.416
# Kel mant'ai

39:22.090 --> 39:24.380
# Or'intani

39:24.409 --> 39:27.943
# Kel han'dai

39:32.284 --> 39:36.697
# Iti Sha'shan han'dai.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.920
Did you forget, Mother?

39:40.679 --> 39:42.719
Where are we, Mother?

39:46.956 --> 39:48.994
Father! You have returned home?

39:52.672 --> 39:54.711
We are not in Chulak, my son.

39:54.751 --> 39:56.791
But we are with Father?

39:56.829 --> 39:58.027
Yes.

39:59.068 --> 40:01.559
Then to me,... we are home.

40:12.860 --> 40:16.193
<i>Teal'c, you have a go!</i>

40:17.498 --> 40:19.822
<i>I must thank you all again.</i>

40:21.056 --> 40:23.427
I would like to stay and get to know you.

40:23.454 --> 40:27.498
You wouldn't have much of a life here.
You'd be virtual prisoners.

40:27.452 --> 40:31.697
But you're welcome in the Land of Light.
They're good people.

40:32.289 --> 40:37.744
Yep, and they got tons of wide-open
spaces for you to play and misbehave in!

40:39.565 --> 40:41.605
W-what is it?

40:44.123 --> 40:48.166
Well, I guess I'll have to come visit
and explain a few things.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.244
I shall return.
