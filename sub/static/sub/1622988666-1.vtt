WEBVTT

01:35.750 --> 01:39.291
NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:45.791 --> 02:46.916
Elisa, you okay?

02:48.916 --> 02:50.666
It's the second time I threw up.

02:51.458 --> 02:53.458
You have to eat something, pumpkin.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.791
Surgery's tomorrow at two.

02:55.875 --> 02:58.000
Doctor says you have to be in good health.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.041
Wait, tomorrow?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.583
Why? Do you want to wait?

03:02.875 --> 03:03.750
No.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.333
You're on a trial basis.

03:06.416 --> 03:08.250
You can't afford to have a baby.

03:10.041 --> 03:10.958
I know.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.458
It's the best thing to do.

03:14.833 --> 03:17.750
Come on.
We'll redo our wardrobes soon. Okay?

03:17.833 --> 03:18.833
Huh?

03:19.958 --> 03:20.958
Elisa?

03:21.625 --> 03:22.458
Sounds good?

03:26.625 --> 03:27.958
I love you, sweetie.

03:28.708 --> 03:29.750
Very much.

03:30.708 --> 03:31.791
Me too, Mom.

03:32.291 --> 03:33.416
I'll see you tonight.

03:33.916 --> 03:34.791
Kisses.

03:55.291 --> 03:58.958
HI ELISA, IT'S TIME TO JOIN YOUR FRIENDS

04:21.541 --> 04:23.291
One two, three… Action.

04:23.833 --> 04:27.083
Hi to all of Fabrizio's friends,
and welcome to this new video.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.875
So, a little guessing game.

04:28.958 --> 04:31.500
Where are we going
if I'm singing this song?

04:32.333 --> 04:35.583
The sky is more and more blue

04:36.875 --> 04:41.000
Correct. We're going to my Calabria,
and today with us we have…

04:41.500 --> 04:44.666
Say your name and where you're going.
I'll cut this part.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.166
The profile is called
"Fabrizio's Friends"?

04:47.250 --> 04:48.958
My little sister thought of it.

04:49.041 --> 04:53.041
Hi, I'm Sofia,
and I'm going to a wedding--

04:53.125 --> 04:58.166
Hi. My name is Mark,
and we're going to a "marriaggio."

04:58.250 --> 04:59.458
Your wedding?

05:01.875 --> 05:06.291
Can I ask you not to talk over each other?
Otherwise, I can't edit anything.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.166
Riccardo, doctor.

05:10.041 --> 05:13.333
Can you say something else, please?
Like, where you're going.

05:13.416 --> 05:16.708
I'm going to see my family,
but enough of that now.

05:16.791 --> 05:19.541
I'm sorry, but your close-up is amazing.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.916
You're very photogenic.
You should be an actor.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:25.041 --> 05:28.250
Don't worry.
It's for his Instagram or something.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.416
-It's a travel blog.
-A travel blog.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.625
What do I do?

05:31.708 --> 05:35.166
You can say your name
and where you're going.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.041
I'm Elisa, going to see my parents
for vacation.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.250
Guys, could you elaborate a bit though?

05:42.333 --> 05:44.666
I need people who watch to get attached.

05:45.625 --> 05:46.583
No?

05:46.666 --> 05:49.250
Can you at least say bye,
wave with your hand?

05:49.333 --> 05:50.166
Let's go!

05:50.250 --> 05:54.291
Our friends still have to get warmed up.
So, it's 4:37, and we're--

05:54.375 --> 05:55.750
Ten minutes late.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.708
Ten minutes late, as the doctor says.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.958
Bye, Fabrizio's friends,
and always remember,

06:00.041 --> 06:01.750
"We'll be friends till the end."

06:02.708 --> 06:03.750
Cut. Save it!

06:30.666 --> 06:31.916
Who was the god of time?

06:32.000 --> 06:32.833
Zeus.

06:37.541 --> 06:41.208
Which male animal has to live
inside the female in order to mate?

06:50.333 --> 06:52.000
-You thirsty?
-Thirsty? Yeah.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.083
In the back.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.791
-Another name for wheat?
-Grain.

07:10.416 --> 07:13.833
What does the clown from It feed on?
Children.

07:15.000 --> 07:15.833
Fear.

07:15.916 --> 07:16.875
What did you say?

07:16.958 --> 07:20.333
The kids are a tool.
Pennywise feeds on their fear.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.291
Cheers.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.208
Apostle who betrayed Jesus?

08:17.875 --> 08:21.583
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER MISSING
THE SHADOW OF 'NDRANGHETA

08:24.625 --> 08:25.500
Sì!

08:45.125 --> 08:49.416
THE MAYOR AGAINST THE MAFIA:
WE SHALL NOT BE INTIMIDATED

08:51.458 --> 08:53.875
No, that's the mayor. She has balls.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.750
Got half the town off the streets.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.375
Are you okay?

09:42.750 --> 09:43.875
Why don't you answer?

09:44.625 --> 09:45.750
Answer, please.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.291
If we talk, we'd find a solution
for us and our daughter.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.708
It was a fucked-up moment.
It won't happen again.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.291
But be reasonable.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.208
We're adults. Okay?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.166
-Bye.
-Hey.

10:01.916 --> 10:03.333
The fuck? You can't.

10:03.416 --> 10:06.750
Stop. What the fuck are you doing?

10:09.833 --> 10:11.083
-Mark.
-Listen.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.000
It's not my RV. It's my mom's.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.458
If something happens, she'll bust my head.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.416
-What a dick.
-Yeah, tell him.

10:29.666 --> 10:33.791
"Problem solved," my ass.
Problem not solved, okay? What--

11:14.291 --> 11:15.875
I live in Rome.

11:15.958 --> 11:18.875
Scuola… Study…
Scuola di cinema. Cinema school.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.416
It's complicato, in Italy.

11:40.958 --> 11:42.125
What happened?

11:43.125 --> 11:46.916
An asshole once took my head

11:47.000 --> 11:49.375
and slammed it three times
against the wall.

11:54.416 --> 11:55.750
-Stronzo?
-Stronzo.

13:32.916 --> 13:35.083
-No!
-Let's put him on the couch.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.458
-We have to put a splint on it.
-I have a tent.

13:44.541 --> 13:46.333
-Can you use the poles?
-I think so.

13:46.416 --> 13:48.208
-Poles, stakes, anything.
-Yes.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.291
Calm down. You'll make things worse.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.541
It'll hurt a bit.

13:56.375 --> 13:57.250
Here I am.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.375
-Hold the poles here. Like this.
-Yes.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.666
We're almost done.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.083
Done.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.333
Elisa, call 118.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.000
It doesn't work.

14:25.875 --> 14:26.791
The line's dead.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.250
Fuck, Fabrizio, call 118.

14:31.333 --> 14:34.000
-I did. It doesn't work.
-What? It's 118!

14:34.083 --> 14:35.041
You wanna try?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.958
Sure, I'll try.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.458
Nothing.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.000
Mine doesn't work either.

14:47.416 --> 14:50.958
We need assistance.
Go in the street and look for help.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.458
There is no street.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.625
-Nobody saw anything?
-I fainted.

15:20.708 --> 15:21.583
Me too.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.458
-How did we get here?
-Ask Mark.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.583
What? He dragged the RV here?

15:27.666 --> 15:29.125
Maybe. Why don't you ask him?

15:32.083 --> 15:33.000
Guys.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.416
Anybody home?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.958
We've been in an accident.

16:09.625 --> 16:10.458
Hello?

16:12.041 --> 16:13.375
Nobody's home. Let's go.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.416
-Let's break in.
-The owner?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
What, break in? Let's go back to the RV.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.583
Now it's my fault.

17:01.375 --> 17:05.375
He was falling asleep.
If I didn't swerve, we would've hit it.

17:17.583 --> 17:18.958
He's a moron.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.166
-Where you going?
-To look for the road.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.958
-I'll come with you.
-No need.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.166
Not that way.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.458
-It's all the same.
-No, look at the sun.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.375
We have to go south.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.000
That's south.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.333
Were you a Boy Scout?

18:20.750 --> 18:23.041
No, but I grew up in places like this.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.666
Go back with the others.

18:37.333 --> 18:41.458
MOM
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE

18:41.541 --> 18:45.125
I'M SCARED
WE NEED HELP

18:47.958 --> 18:48.958
Everything okay?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.416
Look how silly he is.

19:19.916 --> 19:21.500
Have you been together long?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Since I moved to the States.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.541
He's not American either.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.416
He'd just gotten there from Bristol.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.625
Where are you from?

19:31.208 --> 19:32.250
Odessa.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.375
But I lived a little bit everywhere.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.416
In Italy as well.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.166
I'm like a hummingbird. You know?
Hummingbird?

19:43.291 --> 19:44.541
What do you do?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.125
An internship in a consulting firm.
I graduated from Bocconi.

19:51.583 --> 19:52.875
You say it like that?

19:53.750 --> 19:55.916
Mostly, I'm just on the computer.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.500
I have a company that creates 3D jewelry.

20:01.458 --> 20:02.708
Your own company?

20:03.375 --> 20:04.458
You're so young.

20:04.541 --> 20:06.541
Well, it's just a startup.

20:06.625 --> 20:07.583
Look.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.708
Nice.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.666
You think it's his fault?

20:26.625 --> 20:27.625
No.

20:28.666 --> 20:30.000
He'll be fine. You'll see.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.041
You have a daughter?

20:44.833 --> 20:46.666
Sorry, I overheard the call.

20:48.833 --> 20:49.708
What's her name?

20:50.583 --> 20:51.416
Alma.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.750
A very noble name. Alma.

20:55.541 --> 20:56.750
Nice. What's it mean?

20:57.458 --> 21:01.041
Means, mind your fucking business.
We should've found the road already.

21:04.750 --> 21:08.541
Once, I saw this American movie

21:08.625 --> 21:13.250
about these people that end up in Limbo,
but they don't realize it.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.625
So they're, like, trapped, you know?

21:16.708 --> 21:19.041
Doomed to repeat the same actions forever.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.208
I don't know.

21:21.291 --> 21:23.708
They wake up. It's always the same day.

21:23.791 --> 21:27.083
Or they go downstairs
and find themselves on the same floor.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.041
What the fuck?

22:35.291 --> 22:36.416
Anybody home?

22:59.333 --> 23:00.291
What is this?

23:01.541 --> 23:02.875
Something satanic?

23:06.958 --> 23:10.500
THE THREE KNIGHTS OF HONOR

23:10.583 --> 23:11.416
More or less.

23:12.375 --> 23:13.541
What do you mean?

23:15.708 --> 23:17.333
That we have to go now.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.000
Look at the heads. The blood's fresh.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.000
The first one has no sight.

24:54.625 --> 24:56.250
But he'll find you in the night.

24:58.041 --> 25:01.750
The second one cannot hear,
but he surely smells your fear.

25:02.875 --> 25:06.375
Third one has no mouth to speak,
but if you see him, don't make a peep.

25:07.916 --> 25:12.125
A winged horse beside them all,
of death he is the call.

25:15.041 --> 25:18.208
It's the legend of Osso,
Mastrosso, and Carcagnosso.

25:19.291 --> 25:21.916
My grandma used to tell it to me
when I was little.

25:26.666 --> 25:29.208
These three brothers
who came from a different world.

25:30.208 --> 25:31.875
A long, long time ago.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.208
People were starving to death,

25:40.125 --> 25:44.500
and they promised to save them,
but only in return for a sacrifice.

25:47.583 --> 25:48.916
So they chose the victim

25:50.750 --> 25:52.750
and prepared for the ritual.

25:56.541 --> 25:58.416
They cut out the tongue…

26:00.333 --> 26:01.375
ears…

26:03.750 --> 26:04.750
and eyes.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.708
With the blood, they quenched the hunger.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.416
But you don't get something for nothing.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.250
So, since then, the famished

26:19.208 --> 26:20.333
became…

26:23.916 --> 26:25.208
like a herd.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.291
Their herd.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.166
Your grandma told you weird stuff.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.541
Enough with the bullshit now.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.208
The heads in the woods.

26:42.291 --> 26:44.458
-Are you sure there were five?
-Five.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.166
Someone's trying to scare us.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.958
Let's spend the night in the RV.
We'll leave tomorrow.

26:54.041 --> 26:55.291
What about Mark?

26:55.375 --> 26:59.583
Right now, we can't move him.
We'll find help and come back for him.

26:59.666 --> 27:00.541
Of course.

27:33.666 --> 27:35.458
Nothing. Nada.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.250
Fifì.

27:59.958 --> 28:01.500
What are you laughing at?

28:01.583 --> 28:02.625
Nothing.

28:03.541 --> 28:04.666
Nothing at all.

28:06.416 --> 28:09.208
We hit a tree a few meters from the road.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.666
Then we wake up
in front of Sam Raimi's house.

28:14.250 --> 28:15.875
There are severed heads

28:16.750 --> 28:18.916
and pictures of crazy farmers.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.333
We're isolated.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.958
Our cell phones don't work.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.000
Why is no one saying it?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.083
It's the classic horror movie.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.250
-Where you going?
-Have to drain the lizard.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.875
MOM

29:43.000 --> 29:45.666
And this? Show Mom how beautiful it is.

29:48.583 --> 29:49.416
Kiss?

29:52.416 --> 29:57.416
You're so cute! Give me a little kiss.
Mom, look how she gives Daddy a kiss.

30:12.333 --> 30:13.166
What is it?

30:17.833 --> 30:20.583
-Wait, where are you going?
-You stay with Mark.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.416
Stay here.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.458
Be careful.

31:11.625 --> 31:14.708
Come out. There's someone in the forest.
We have to get outta here.

31:14.791 --> 31:15.625
What the f…

31:18.875 --> 31:21.416
-What happened? Hey.
-Come.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.750
-Fabri, what's happening?
-Move, go upstairs.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.666
-Can you tell me what the fuck's going on?
-Go!

31:45.833 --> 31:46.916
What is it?

31:56.750 --> 31:58.291
They cut out her tongue.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.000
What did they do to you?

32:10.541 --> 32:12.625
I think it's best if you stay away.

32:14.958 --> 32:15.791
He's right.

32:16.375 --> 32:18.000
-Let's go.
-Will you help me?

32:18.750 --> 32:21.125
-No. We have to go.
-There's a little girl.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.625
-It's a terrible idea.
-Let her be.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.208
Sofia, shit, leave her be! Let's go!

32:28.875 --> 32:30.666
Don't worry. I'll help you.

32:49.041 --> 32:50.291
Turn off the flashlight.

33:05.791 --> 33:08.666
-Shut up!
-Fuck you! Mark!

33:08.750 --> 33:12.500
-Shut up! Close the trapdoor.
-Please, they have a rifle.

33:29.416 --> 33:32.833
Quiet. Shut up.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.250
What do you want?

36:55.416 --> 36:57.416
We have to go. Let's move.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.500
-Wait.
-Wait for what?

37:02.666 --> 37:04.541
We can't leave her here.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.625
Move.

37:15.625 --> 37:16.458
Come.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.958
She's your responsibility. Let's go.

40:47.541 --> 40:48.625
We're not the first.

40:54.916 --> 40:57.458
-What are you doing?
-Maybe I can find something to eat.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.208
Or maybe this.

41:01.916 --> 41:02.750
How about you all?

41:03.541 --> 41:05.166
Why are you just standing there?

41:07.541 --> 41:09.000
Bunch of incompetents.

41:09.708 --> 41:11.541
Two little girls. A dumbass.

41:11.625 --> 41:12.750
You're a lost cause.

41:13.708 --> 41:14.708
What did you say?

41:15.875 --> 41:17.041
What did you say?

41:17.875 --> 41:19.125
I'm a lost cause?

41:19.208 --> 41:21.333
Well, if you say so, it must be true.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.458
-You're the expert.
-Go ahead, say it.

41:24.333 --> 41:25.250
Let it out.

41:25.833 --> 41:28.125
Yes, I will. I have no problem saying it.

41:28.208 --> 41:30.666
-We're here because of Mark.
-How can you say that?

41:30.750 --> 41:32.750
-Have some respect, doctor.
-Respect?

41:33.500 --> 41:35.833
Respect for what? Because he died?

41:36.500 --> 41:38.333
That's what we'll be doing tonight!

41:38.416 --> 41:41.208
You left him to die. You abandoned him.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.791
You didn't let me help him.

41:42.875 --> 41:46.083
Who do you think we are?
The Ninja Turtles?

41:46.166 --> 41:47.333
They were just farmers.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.666
Sick people.

41:49.750 --> 41:52.000
I'm not getting killed for someone
who was driving drunk

41:52.083 --> 41:53.458
and got us in this mess.

41:53.541 --> 41:54.375
Will you stop?

41:54.875 --> 41:56.541
It was an accident.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.458
I'm a doctor.

42:02.333 --> 42:03.791
I cure people.

42:03.875 --> 42:05.041
I don't save them.

42:06.833 --> 42:07.666
Oh yeah?

42:09.250 --> 42:10.958
Can I ask you something, Riccardo?

42:12.708 --> 42:14.416
What kind of doctor carpools?

42:15.791 --> 42:19.583
As far as I know, doctors travel
on planes, trains, rental cars.

42:22.291 --> 42:23.791
What kind of doctor are you?

42:25.125 --> 42:27.750
What the fuck
has this to do with anything?

42:27.833 --> 42:29.666
-Enough fighting. Come on.
-Shut up!

42:32.083 --> 42:34.291
It's not like you did much to save him.

42:36.291 --> 42:37.708
Why didn't you bite my hand?

42:41.625 --> 42:43.458
Why didn't you kick me in the balls?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.958
You didn't try hard enough
to save the love of your life.

42:54.708 --> 42:56.250
You could've tried harder.

43:30.250 --> 43:31.500
Can I see it?

43:36.583 --> 43:37.416
Is it yours?

43:44.833 --> 43:45.916
It's a beautiful name.

44:14.833 --> 44:16.666
You know the way out of this forest?

44:35.875 --> 44:38.875
IT'S NOT A FOREST

44:39.583 --> 44:41.375
What do you mean it's not a forest?

45:03.166 --> 45:04.125
We have to go.

45:53.541 --> 45:55.000
Are you kidding me?

46:11.958 --> 46:13.166
Where the fuck's the RV?

46:14.583 --> 46:16.375
They took the RV!

46:16.958 --> 46:20.541
I was sure we were going the right way,
south.

46:21.166 --> 46:24.875
-I don't understand why we're here.
-Yeah? You were sure?

46:24.958 --> 46:26.166
-You were sure?
-Wait.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.666
How's it possible
that we went in a circle?

46:28.750 --> 46:30.166
-I don't know--
-You don't?

46:30.250 --> 46:32.000
-We were going south!
-You don't know?

46:32.083 --> 46:34.833
I wanna save myself as much as you.
I don't understand…

46:34.916 --> 46:36.708
We were going south.

46:39.291 --> 46:45.666
Fuck.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.000
It's okay.

46:50.916 --> 46:52.666
Maybe I'm… in a coma.

46:55.166 --> 46:56.583
Maybe it's just a nightmare.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.375
And you all don't even exist.

47:02.208 --> 47:05.416
Believe me.
I wish I didn't exist either, right now.

47:18.583 --> 47:20.666
At least they forgot this.

47:28.625 --> 47:30.416
Yesterday, they came after dark.

47:35.208 --> 47:38.083
I don't feel like going back in,
but outside's worse.

47:39.916 --> 47:40.791
He's right.

47:42.333 --> 47:43.500
What if they come back?

47:45.625 --> 47:49.375
If they come back, we'll burn everything.
The forest and this fucking house.

48:38.708 --> 48:40.458
No, thanks. I'm on guard duty.

48:54.291 --> 48:55.583
Disciplinary action.

48:57.916 --> 48:58.750
I made

48:59.791 --> 49:00.666
a mistake…

49:03.416 --> 49:04.500
and the patient died.

49:07.041 --> 49:08.375
My work was my life.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.250
I lost everything.

49:13.583 --> 49:15.750
Then, one thing led to another.

49:15.833 --> 49:20.375
I'm at home with my wife.
One wrong word at the wrong time, and I…

49:22.666 --> 49:24.666
She doesn't even let me see my daughter.

49:26.458 --> 49:27.291
Rightly so.

49:30.750 --> 49:33.083
I was going back home to live with my mom.

49:33.166 --> 49:35.541
She still thinks I'm 15.
She said, "Come back home."

49:37.250 --> 49:38.083
Come back home.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.833
That's the kind of doctor I am.

50:03.416 --> 50:05.541
One day, I was camping,

50:05.625 --> 50:08.166
and there was this guy
from the North who said,

50:09.125 --> 50:11.458
"You're from the South.
You must be a mafioso."

50:13.250 --> 50:14.541
And I said,

50:15.041 --> 50:17.375
"Not everyone from the South
is a mafioso."

50:18.958 --> 50:20.000
But he insisted.

50:21.083 --> 50:22.375
He said, "No."

50:22.916 --> 50:25.125
"You're from the South. You're a mafioso."

50:27.916 --> 50:29.750
I tried to reason with him,

50:29.833 --> 50:32.916
saying that there are southerners
who don't eat pizza,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.458
and there are southerners
who aren't in the Mafia.

50:37.416 --> 50:41.041
The next day, he says again,
"No, you're from the South."

50:41.125 --> 50:42.125
"You're a mafioso."

50:43.958 --> 50:45.666
So I had to have him killed.

51:16.666 --> 51:19.541
One day, I told my parents
I wanted to quit college.

51:20.583 --> 51:21.958
I wanted to do something else.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.333
My mom put me in the car
and took me to the sea.

51:28.041 --> 51:30.166
A beautiful villa with a pool.

51:31.958 --> 51:32.958
She said,

51:33.958 --> 51:35.208
"Look at it."

51:36.791 --> 51:39.250
She insisted, "Take a better look."

51:42.375 --> 51:45.458
"This house would've been ours
if we hadn't paid for your studies."

51:46.583 --> 51:48.875
Two days later, I was back in class.

51:54.416 --> 51:55.750
I do it for Mark.

52:01.333 --> 52:02.708
You do it for the baby.

52:05.208 --> 52:06.041
You knew?

52:06.958 --> 52:08.708
Honey, everyone figured it out.

52:10.833 --> 52:13.625
His days were already numbered
before ending up here.

52:14.541 --> 52:15.375
Oh yeah?

52:16.875 --> 52:18.125
It's the best thing.

52:23.625 --> 52:24.583
Don't you think?

52:27.125 --> 52:28.291
How would I know?

52:42.125 --> 52:42.958
Take it.

52:45.375 --> 52:46.833
It's not true that it's nice.

52:47.958 --> 52:49.250
But it was my first one.

52:50.750 --> 52:53.375
When I finished it,
I knew I could make it on my own.

53:00.625 --> 53:02.833
Hey. Don't cry.

56:42.583 --> 56:43.750
Don't look.

56:44.333 --> 56:45.625
Please don't look.

59:13.291 --> 59:15.333
We didn't even notice.

59:16.083 --> 59:17.458
It doesn't make sense.

59:20.625 --> 59:21.791
I'm sorry.

59:29.125 --> 59:30.416
Can I hug you?

1:00:03.916 --> 1:00:05.333
We didn't wake up.

1:00:06.333 --> 1:00:07.750
What was in this?

1:00:11.333 --> 1:00:12.333
What are you saying?

1:00:13.125 --> 1:00:14.458
You never drank.

1:00:15.666 --> 1:00:17.083
Why didn't you drink?

1:00:17.833 --> 1:00:18.916
Are you crazy?

1:00:23.083 --> 1:00:24.875
Please, I can't take it anymore.

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:28.875
We're the only ones left.

1:00:32.541 --> 1:00:34.250
I'm scared, Elisa.

1:00:38.791 --> 1:00:39.958
I'm scared.

1:00:54.916 --> 1:00:56.291
Fabrizio, you hear me?

1:01:00.333 --> 1:01:01.791
Take her below the deer.

1:01:12.791 --> 1:01:15.583
If you can hear us,
take the girl below the deer.

1:01:16.166 --> 1:01:17.000
Who are you?

1:01:19.791 --> 1:01:21.125
I'm Fabrizio. It's me.

1:01:25.625 --> 1:01:26.541
Who's talking?

1:01:26.625 --> 1:01:28.166
-Nobody.
-Stay away!

1:01:31.958 --> 1:01:33.666
Fabrizio, can you hear me?

1:01:33.750 --> 1:01:35.166
It's Fabrizio. It's me.

1:01:36.083 --> 1:01:39.583
The pathetic one. The dumbass…
What else you guys call me?

1:01:40.291 --> 1:01:41.291
Here, give it to me.

1:01:43.416 --> 1:01:44.250
Give it to me.

1:01:47.208 --> 1:01:49.541
I told you to give it to me,
for fuck's sake!

1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:58.333
No.

1:02:01.291 --> 1:02:02.125
No.

1:02:04.458 --> 1:02:05.291
No!

1:02:07.291 --> 1:02:08.125
No!

1:02:11.208 --> 1:02:14.041
No!

1:02:15.083 --> 1:02:20.916
No!

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.458
You're a bitch, a fucking whore!

1:02:24.541 --> 1:02:27.666
A fucking slut! You've ruined everything!

1:02:27.750 --> 1:02:30.083
Everything! You've ruined it!

1:02:30.916 --> 1:02:32.458
You're a fucking bitch!

1:02:57.791 --> 1:02:58.625
Take her.

1:03:15.791 --> 1:03:18.625
Help! Someone help me!

1:03:20.625 --> 1:03:22.000
Help me!

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.250
Dad, tell me something.

1:03:59.333 --> 1:04:02.291
When Grandpa was heartbroken,
he kept saying,

1:04:02.375 --> 1:04:05.125
"There's no respect anymore!"
Dad, what's respect?

1:04:09.416 --> 1:04:12.958
My son, respect is the virtue

1:04:13.041 --> 1:04:16.500
That every Calabrian man has in his heart

1:04:16.583 --> 1:04:19.500
This feeling doesn't exist anymore

1:04:20.125 --> 1:04:23.666
Respect is over, and so is honor

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:27.291
When your granddad talked about his past

1:04:27.375 --> 1:04:30.375
And his youth to his children

1:04:31.041 --> 1:04:34.000
He ended up with a broken heart

1:04:34.666 --> 1:04:38.375
Remembering everything
That isn't here anymore

1:04:48.250 --> 1:04:49.416
Help.

1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:51.708
Please.

1:04:56.416 --> 1:04:57.291
Dad.

1:04:57.375 --> 1:05:00.791
Who were the three knights
that Grandpa always talked about?

1:05:10.416 --> 1:05:13.500
The three wise knights he mentioned

1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.916
Were three saints of the holy circles

1:05:17.416 --> 1:05:20.333
They brought us the honorable laws

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:25.208
And we are all devoted to them

1:05:44.583 --> 1:05:46.500
To the Three Knights of Honor.

1:05:47.125 --> 1:05:48.583
Our patron saints.

1:05:48.666 --> 1:05:53.291
Osso, Mastrosso, and Carcagnosso. Cheers.

1:05:59.541 --> 1:06:00.958
Now, enjoy your meal.

1:06:30.041 --> 1:06:30.875
Enough!

1:06:57.625 --> 1:06:58.458
See?

1:06:59.333 --> 1:07:00.708
They're all happy.

1:07:02.708 --> 1:07:04.083
Because I look after them.

1:07:05.375 --> 1:07:07.125
I am everybody's mom.

1:07:09.166 --> 1:07:11.000
I am everybody's mom, right?

1:07:13.166 --> 1:07:14.500
They're not mean.

1:07:15.250 --> 1:07:16.791
They're mocking you.

1:07:18.458 --> 1:07:20.875
But they know
you're the most precious one here.

1:07:26.375 --> 1:07:27.291
If you don't die,

1:07:27.875 --> 1:07:29.833
how can I look after them?

1:07:36.291 --> 1:07:37.541
You're so beautiful.

1:07:38.416 --> 1:07:39.958
Such a beautiful girl.

1:07:41.125 --> 1:07:42.041
I'm sorry.

1:07:45.333 --> 1:07:47.333
But the Mafia isn't what it used to be.

1:07:50.291 --> 1:07:52.000
We all have to adapt.

1:07:56.333 --> 1:08:02.958
THREE KNIGHTS CAMPING

1:08:11.333 --> 1:08:12.500
Help.

1:08:15.708 --> 1:08:17.375
Eat before it gets cold.

1:08:18.750 --> 1:08:23.208
Help.

1:08:24.916 --> 1:08:27.250
Help me!

1:08:30.375 --> 1:08:34.041
Help! Help me!

1:08:45.958 --> 1:08:48.000
Help!

1:10:30.375 --> 1:10:31.916
Give us a nice smile, Mommy.

1:10:38.375 --> 1:10:39.791
You recorded everything.

1:10:40.333 --> 1:10:41.541
There.

1:10:42.166 --> 1:10:43.375
I have to be honest.

1:10:43.458 --> 1:10:45.416
Sometimes you guys fuck things up,

1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:47.500
but this moment when you figure it out…

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.791
It's the fucking best.

1:10:52.625 --> 1:10:53.708
Where is Chiara?

1:10:54.916 --> 1:10:56.208
What'd you do to her?

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.500
No spoilers, honey.

1:11:00.083 --> 1:11:01.625
Is this what you do?

1:11:03.791 --> 1:11:05.958
Videos of people dying?

1:11:07.833 --> 1:11:09.166
They're horror movies.

1:11:20.416 --> 1:11:21.541
The fuck are you laughing at?

1:11:28.750 --> 1:11:31.625
So I die in some loser's fake movie.

1:11:33.250 --> 1:11:36.041
Where the bad guys are called Osso,

1:11:37.458 --> 1:11:38.583
Mastrosso, and

1:11:39.541 --> 1:11:42.458
Ca… Caradosso!

1:11:42.541 --> 1:11:44.500
Carcagnosso. It's not that hard.

1:11:44.583 --> 1:11:46.583
They're the three founders of the Mafia,

1:11:46.666 --> 1:11:50.500
and I turned them into the new Freddy,
Jason, and Leatherface. I'm a genius.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.250
In the States, they would've already
signed me up for a sequel.

1:11:56.041 --> 1:11:57.416
Your movie sucks.

1:12:00.416 --> 1:12:02.333
It's a rip-off of so many others.

1:12:05.250 --> 1:12:07.125
People like you always criticize.

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:11.291
Then in Italy, all you get is crappy
comedies and shitty YouTuber movies.

1:12:11.791 --> 1:12:13.458
In Italy, no one wants to be scared.

1:12:13.541 --> 1:12:15.958
You go to the movies and are all, "Gross!"

1:12:16.041 --> 1:12:19.416
"Help, help. Boohoo…"

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:24.375
But then, you turn on the TV,
and there's nothing but death.

1:12:24.458 --> 1:12:26.416
All day long.

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:27.666
Because you like it.

1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:31.916
The student who massacres her roommate,
that's what you like.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.583
The mom who choked her son… Wonderful.

1:12:35.666 --> 1:12:39.083
The husband who stabs his wife.
That sells more than cocaine.

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:45.375
And you're asking me
what we're doing here.

1:12:47.166 --> 1:12:48.708
This is what you want.

1:12:50.208 --> 1:12:53.000
This is the most sought-after
original content.

1:12:54.041 --> 1:12:54.916
It's the future.

1:12:58.250 --> 1:12:59.083
Not mine.

1:13:00.333 --> 1:13:01.291
We'll see.

1:17:12.125 --> 1:17:13.125
Bitch!

1:17:13.708 --> 1:17:15.833
Fucking bitch!

1:17:15.916 --> 1:17:19.125
I swear. I would kill her twice.

1:17:19.208 --> 1:17:21.750
Twice I'd like to kill that fucking tease!

1:17:21.833 --> 1:17:24.666
-But she fooled you.
-That scrawny bitch!

1:17:29.750 --> 1:17:31.166
Wait. I have an idea.

1:17:31.250 --> 1:17:32.541
-You do?
-Yes.

1:17:32.625 --> 1:17:36.250
Yes. So, basically, we have
the beautiful shot of the masked men.

1:17:37.041 --> 1:17:39.625
We stay longer
on those two assholes' sacrifice.

1:17:39.708 --> 1:17:41.125
Okay? Cut.

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.041
And there she is, lying in the house.

1:17:45.125 --> 1:17:49.583
I hold her tight in my arms,
and I say my beautiful line,

1:17:49.666 --> 1:17:51.625
"Elisa. Elisa, I'm scared."

1:17:52.125 --> 1:17:54.875
"I'm scared. Elisa, I'm scared."

1:17:55.875 --> 1:17:56.916
It doesn't work.

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:01.416
How will you knock her out?
If you hit her again, she'll die.

1:18:03.291 --> 1:18:04.916
-With the beer.
-Doesn't work.

1:18:05.416 --> 1:18:08.625
Come on. I mean, all you can say is,
"It doesn't work."

1:18:08.708 --> 1:18:11.875
Mom was clear.
The client wants her conscious.

1:18:11.958 --> 1:18:15.541
Fuck Mom too!

1:18:15.625 --> 1:18:19.875
-Lower your voice.
-Fuck that! I'm not lowering my voice!

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:21.958
Look what I've been through

1:18:22.041 --> 1:18:25.458
to get the RV
because the English guy wanted to drive!

1:18:25.541 --> 1:18:28.041
You screwed it up.
You caused the accident.

1:18:28.125 --> 1:18:30.000
-And that Elisa!
-I don't care.

1:18:30.083 --> 1:18:33.583
Only thing she figured out
is there was something in the beer!

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:34.583
Did I complain?

1:18:34.666 --> 1:18:37.666
I was scratched up,
always sweaty, and I couldn't talk.

1:18:37.750 --> 1:18:39.916
-You're useless!
-I cut out your tongue!

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.000
I'm the director.

1:18:41.083 --> 1:18:44.666
I'll go to Mom, and she'll kick your ass
because you can't do anything.

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:49.750
-I'm the artist in this family.
-Lower your voice!

1:18:49.833 --> 1:18:51.041
Shut up!

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:03.125
You're incompetent.

1:19:06.125 --> 1:19:07.250
Midget.

1:19:25.250 --> 1:19:27.416
Two days with this thing in my mouth.

1:19:28.041 --> 1:19:31.541
-Next time, I'll be the bad guy.
-Mom doesn't know shit about horror.

1:19:31.625 --> 1:19:33.291
She's the boss.

1:19:33.375 --> 1:19:36.375
If she wants her to be conscious
when she dies, she will be.

1:19:36.458 --> 1:19:40.583
Doesn't make any sense.
Like Leonardo DiCaprio frozen.

1:19:40.666 --> 1:19:42.666
Why the fuck doesn't he climb on the door?

1:19:46.750 --> 1:19:48.833
That is true. There was room.

1:19:49.416 --> 1:19:52.041
We'll be ready in 15.
Get the girl into the house.

1:19:52.875 --> 1:19:54.541
There you go. Huh?

1:19:55.625 --> 1:19:58.625
Now what? What do I do now?
Tell me, what do I do?

1:19:59.208 --> 1:20:00.083
I don't know.

1:20:08.083 --> 1:20:10.875
Stop drinking,
or you'll have to pee on set.

1:20:11.458 --> 1:20:12.750
I speak from experience.

1:20:30.208 --> 1:20:31.083
Oh fuck.

1:21:12.916 --> 1:21:14.541
The girl escaped!

1:21:16.666 --> 1:21:18.125
The girl escaped!

1:21:24.916 --> 1:21:27.125
Okay, you'll kill me, and then what?

1:21:27.208 --> 1:21:28.833
What the fuck you gonna do?

1:21:28.916 --> 1:21:31.791
They're in the house waiting for you.

1:21:36.291 --> 1:21:39.791
They'll cut you up,
and they'll feed you to the pigs.

1:21:39.875 --> 1:21:42.541
You understand?
They'll feed you to the pigs.

1:21:44.791 --> 1:21:45.625
Come on.

1:21:48.541 --> 1:21:49.791
Put that rifle down.

1:21:51.375 --> 1:21:53.333
Let's find a solution, something.

1:21:53.416 --> 1:21:55.375
If you want to live, you need me.

1:21:55.958 --> 1:21:59.208
-You can't do it alone.
-You fucking talk too much.

1:22:02.416 --> 1:22:04.041
Please, don't do it.

1:22:06.541 --> 1:22:08.041
I'm scared.

1:22:10.333 --> 1:22:11.958
I'm scared.

1:22:15.333 --> 1:22:18.333
Don't worry. It's just a movie.

1:22:21.208 --> 1:22:22.125
Bitch.

1:22:22.833 --> 1:22:27.041
You bitch. You deserve to die on--

1:23:03.375 --> 1:23:04.708
There is your ending.

1:25:02.875 --> 1:25:07.791
MILITARY AREA - NO TRESPASSING
ARMED SURVEILLANCE

1:26:17.958 --> 1:26:19.625
MOM
THE SURGERY IS IN A FEW HOURS

1:26:19.708 --> 1:26:20.916
WHY IS YOUR MOBILE OFF?

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.958
IF IT'S A PRANK,
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:08.750
COMMENTS ON THE MOVIE?

1:28:08.833 --> 1:28:10.625
I LASTED 2 MINUTES, BORING

1:28:10.708 --> 1:28:12.541
I LIKED IT

1:28:12.625 --> 1:28:14.250
ELISA SHOULD'VE CROAKED

1:28:14.333 --> 1:28:15.791
RIPPED OFF OTHER MOVIES

1:28:15.875 --> 1:28:17.416
THE LEGEND IS REAL!

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.791
OSSO, MASTROSSO, AND CARCAGNOSSO?

1:28:19.875 --> 1:28:21.625
YES, GOOGLE IT.

1:28:21.708 --> 1:28:24.500
US ITALIANS ARE NOT GOOD
AT MAKING HORROR MOVIES.

1:28:24.583 --> 1:28:25.875
MORE BLOOD OR NO MEMBERSHIP

1:28:25.958 --> 1:28:27.791
AT LEAST ARE THEY UNDERSTANDABLE?

1:28:27.875 --> 1:28:30.208
THE DIRECTOR IS ITALIAN, SHOW SUPPORT.

1:28:30.291 --> 1:28:32.458
NO KITTY

1:28:32.541 --> 1:28:36.458
SUPERLIKE FOR BLONDIE'S ASS

1:28:36.541 --> 1:28:38.083
RIGHT. I'LL WATCH IT NOW.

Guys, could you elaborate a bit though?

1:29:01.958 --> 1:29:04.541
I need the people who watch
to get attached.

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:06.416
No?

1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:09.000
Can you at least say bye,
wave with your hand?

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:14.000
You bitch. You deserve to die on--

1:29:16.208 --> 1:29:19.000
Dad, food is ready. Are you coming?

1:29:22.333 --> 1:29:23.416
I'm coming, pumpkin.
