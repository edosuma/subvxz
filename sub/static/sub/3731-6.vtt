03:00.215 --> 03:02.884
- I was just...
- ...thinking about you.

03:16.815 --> 03:17.816
Cheers.

03:18.858 --> 03:20.193
Cheers.

03:29.535 --> 03:31.204
I'm Riley, by the way.

03:31.288 --> 03:33.373
I'm Will.

03:37.043 --> 03:38.378
You're a cop?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.216
You're a musician?

03:43.300 --> 03:45.385
No. Just a DJ.

03:45.468 --> 03:48.429
That's-- That's cool.

03:50.265 --> 03:53.226
- You live in Chicago?
- Yeah.

03:53.310 --> 03:57.063
You're in, uh... London, right?

03:57.147 --> 03:59.191
Ah, that's so cool.
I've always wanted to go.

03:59.274 --> 04:01.442
Well, here you are.

04:02.777 --> 04:04.404
Yeah, but...

04:05.530 --> 04:07.740
I know.

04:07.824 --> 04:09.409
Are we going crazy?

04:12.329 --> 04:13.997
I got an idea.

04:14.873 --> 04:16.082
Give me your phone.

04:19.961 --> 04:24.090
All right, now, there's no way
you could know this number, right?

04:24.174 --> 04:27.844
So when you hit this button...

04:29.095 --> 04:31.264
that phone shouldn't ring, right?

04:32.807 --> 04:34.767
OK. Call me.

04:43.068 --> 04:45.737
[phone ringing]

04:50.491 --> 04:52.535
Hey, Diego!

04:55.830 --> 04:57.999
- Hey, Diego.
- What's up?

04:58.083 --> 05:00.877
There's something going on with
my hearing. Can you pick this up for me?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.003
Yeah.

05:04.339 --> 05:08.260
- Hello?
- Uh, hi. Is Will there?

05:08.343 --> 05:10.429
Yeah. Hang on.

05:11.471 --> 05:14.140
- Some chick with a weird accent.
- Weird accent?

05:14.224 --> 05:17.102
- She sounds hot.
- I like him.

05:17.185 --> 05:19.104
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

05:21.231 --> 05:24.692
- Safe to say we're not going crazy.
- [over phone] ...not going crazy.

05:24.776 --> 05:28.154
- Oh, my God. This is so cool.
- [over phone] This is so cool.

05:33.618 --> 05:35.912
Have you had any other visitors?

05:36.621 --> 05:38.957
Jonas said that there were eight of us.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.166
Jonas?

05:40.959 --> 05:42.877
He was with the woman who shot herself.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.588
Angelica.

05:45.671 --> 05:47.006
How did you know that?

05:47.090 --> 05:48.967
I'm not sure.

05:51.803 --> 05:56.349
That... That time you came to the church,
you seemed really scared.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.644
Like something happened.

06:00.686 --> 06:02.147
You OK?

06:03.315 --> 06:05.108
I-- I am sorry.

06:05.191 --> 06:06.651
It's none of my business, I get it.

06:08.153 --> 06:10.780
I have complicated friends.

06:10.863 --> 06:13.158
Hey, tell me about it.

06:13.241 --> 06:15.410
I should probably go to bed.

06:15.494 --> 06:17.912
Yeah, well, must be
pretty late there, huh?

07:27.023 --> 07:31.611
They took it all, Neets.
My laptop, back-ups...

07:32.778 --> 07:34.197
Oh, my God.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.869
They even took all of my journals.

07:51.797 --> 07:53.550
This isn't fair.

07:55.594 --> 07:59.889
- None of this is fair.
- No, it's not.

08:01.224 --> 08:04.727
- I didn't do anything.
- I know, sweetie.

08:07.021 --> 08:11.150
This isn't gonna stop. They're never
gonna leave us alone, are they?

08:14.112 --> 08:16.072
Unless we make them.

08:16.155 --> 08:18.199
Uh-oh.

08:18.283 --> 08:20.201
You got that look in your eye.

08:20.285 --> 08:22.036
Fuck these guys, Neets.

08:23.622 --> 08:25.164
We'll need a place.

[reporter] How long ago
did you start embezzling?

08:47.437 --> 08:49.439
Do you regret what you did?

08:49.522 --> 08:52.150
For my actions taken...

08:54.235 --> 08:57.155
to embezzle funds from this firm,

08:57.238 --> 09:01.576
I have offered to surrender to police,
pending trial.

09:02.702 --> 09:04.704
I acted alone in this.

09:04.787 --> 09:09.292
Neither my father, my brother,
nor any other member of my family

09:09.375 --> 09:11.794
were involved or profited in any way.

09:15.298 --> 09:16.841
That's all I have to say.

Where is it?

10:50.560 --> 10:52.186
The money.

10:54.439 --> 10:56.982
I don't have it. I gave it away.

11:00.779 --> 11:02.530
'Course you did.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.241
'Course you did.

Look at my face, Riley.
Look at my face.

11:16.753 --> 11:18.463
Look what they did to me.

11:29.348 --> 11:34.270
This is nothing compared
to what I will do to you.

11:36.021 --> 11:38.775
The money and the drugs...

11:41.068 --> 11:44.029
or you die right now.

11:46.866 --> 11:49.368
I swear I don't have them.

11:50.829 --> 11:52.997
I threw them away.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.416
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.086
I'm so sorry, Riley.

12:01.881 --> 12:03.424
I don't believe you.

12:03.508 --> 12:04.967
No, no, no, no.

Please, Nyx. I promise you--

[gasps, panting]

12:40.753 --> 12:42.714
I hate violence.

12:43.548 --> 12:47.051

Violence changes things.

12:50.638 --> 12:54.433
[sobs, gasps]

13:03.025 --> 13:06.946
I love how violence
can change something

13:07.029 --> 13:10.867
as simple and ubiquitous...

13:12.493 --> 13:14.161
as a plastic bag here,

I am so glad you called.

Baby.

[relieved sighs]

16:13.465 --> 16:14.466
Hi?

16:14.550 --> 16:18.012
We decided it might be wise
to keep a watch on you.

16:18.096 --> 16:23.183
We all watched, all night,
but very quietly.

16:23.267 --> 16:25.061
Huh.

16:25.144 --> 16:30.066
Thank you, but I'm fine, I think.

16:30.149 --> 16:35.237
You must understand,
when you went over like that so suddenly,

16:35.320 --> 16:37.782
we were terrified
something has happened to you.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.369
Nothing matters to us
more than your well-being.

16:43.245 --> 16:45.998
Thank you, but I'm fine, really.

16:46.082 --> 16:47.833
You're sure?

16:47.917 --> 16:50.628
Yeah. Why?

16:51.796 --> 16:54.090

17:27.915 --> 17:28.833
Hello, again.

17:30.001 --> 17:31.002
Oh, no.

17:32.003 --> 17:33.879
No, no.

17:34.630 --> 17:36.548
Oh, no.

17:36.632 --> 17:39.426
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:44.140 --> 17:47.893
You have already ruined my life.

17:47.977 --> 17:49.478
I didn't ruin anything.

17:49.561 --> 17:52.023
You didn't want to marry that guy.

17:52.106 --> 17:54.274
That is not for you to say.

17:54.358 --> 17:57.153
Maybe not, but you wanted me to say it.

17:57.236 --> 17:59.780
You don't know what I want.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.324
Don't I?

18:06.912 --> 18:07.913
No.

18:07.997 --> 18:14.879
OK, I don't know what is going on here,
if-- if I am totally losing my mind,

18:14.962 --> 18:20.634
or if one of the gods or goddesses
is angry with me and has sent a demon.

18:20.718 --> 18:25.347
A dangerous pervert demon
who never seems to have any clothes on.

18:26.932 --> 18:29.393
- Germans are not so uptight about nudity.
- Mm.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.312
This is not about nudity, OK?
This is-- This is about decency.

18:32.396 --> 18:34.815
It is about privacy.

18:34.899 --> 18:38.485
If you were so concerned with privacy
and decency, why did you look?

18:39.737 --> 18:41.113
I did not.

18:41.197 --> 18:43.074
Yes, you did.

18:43.157 --> 18:45.659
You looked then and you're looking now.

18:46.911 --> 18:48.662
[sighs] I'm not.

18:49.454 --> 18:50.831
Listen...

18:51.999 --> 18:53.667
I don't know what's
happening to us either,

18:53.751 --> 18:57.296
but I do know that from the moment
I first saw you, I wanted you.

18:58.422 --> 19:01.717
And somehow, I feel
that you want me, too.

19:05.387 --> 19:07.389
Oh, my God.

19:08.766 --> 19:10.893
You are a demon.

19:19.068 --> 19:20.402
[whistles]

19:20.485 --> 19:24.949

It's life and death, good and evil.

19:25.032 --> 19:27.201
[crowd cheering]

19:27.826 --> 19:30.037
La parca negra is a symbol.

19:30.121 --> 19:32.039
He is the devil in our lives.

19:32.123 --> 19:33.916
For some, he can represent the government,

19:33.999 --> 19:36.168
the class system
or any form of oppression.

19:36.252 --> 19:39.880
But for most of us,
he is that fear we're afraid to face.

19:39.964 --> 19:41.340
Come on!

19:43.717 --> 19:44.843
Come on!

19:44.927 --> 19:48.806
You will discover that Hernando
thinks a lot about everything.

19:48.889 --> 19:52.226
- That's what I love about him.
- I get it.

19:52.310 --> 19:54.603
[crowd clamoring]

19:56.438 --> 19:58.316
- You love this, don't you?
- Mm!

19:58.398 --> 20:01.777
- I love art, all kinds of art.
- [laughs]

20:01.860 --> 20:04.446
I mean, this is a dance
that is also a fight.

20:05.323 --> 20:09.118
The struggle that takes place in the ring
is a reflection of the struggle

20:09.201 --> 20:11.996
that takes place in our minds
and in our hearts.

20:12.079 --> 20:15.291
At some point,
we all encounter our own parca negra.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.210
He is that thing we are afraid of,

20:18.294 --> 20:22.798
that thing that stops us from becoming
what we know we can become.

20:23.632 --> 20:26.969
Until we defeat him,
we will never know peace.

20:27.052 --> 20:28.929
Oh!

20:29.013 --> 20:30.555
- Get him!
- Come on!

20:30.639 --> 20:32.683
- [shouts in Spanish]
- Come on!

20:32.766 --> 20:36.145
[crowd clamoring]

20:37.229 --> 20:39.564
[crowd noise fades]

20:52.661 --> 20:54.372
Mm.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.541
Your father's patra ni machhi
is a gift to my mouth.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.711
Every taste bud
is dancing and singing his praise.

21:02.754 --> 21:04.840
It's his grandmother's recipe.

21:04.923 --> 21:06.466
Mm.

21:06.550 --> 21:10.637
Amazing. Absolutely amazing to me
how lives can span generations

21:10.721 --> 21:15.434
in something as simple as a recipe,
or something as complex as DNA.

21:17.269 --> 21:20.480
By all accounts, great-grandmother
was a very difficult person,

21:20.564 --> 21:23.025
who told my father he was a terrible cook,

21:23.108 --> 21:26.486
and hated the way he made
the patra ni machhi.

21:26.570 --> 21:28.280
Well, back then,
it must have been very hard

21:28.364 --> 21:30.824
for a woman with her obvious talents.

21:30.908 --> 21:32.492
Even today, she would have a hard time

21:32.576 --> 21:36.621
getting the same recognition
your father gets just because he's a man.

21:37.622 --> 21:39.833
Well, our parents do
the best that they can,

21:39.917 --> 21:41.543
and it's our job to forgive them.

21:41.626 --> 21:46.715
Rajan, you're not making this easy,
but I think we should just get on with it.

21:46.798 --> 21:49.468
- Get on with what?
- I know why you came here.

21:49.551 --> 21:53.097
I know that if it was you that had fainted
just before you were to marry me,

21:53.180 --> 21:56.100
oh, dear, I'd be absolutely sure
that you hated me

21:56.183 --> 21:57.935
and that you didn't
want anything to do with me.

21:58.018 --> 21:59.853
- Kala, slow down.
- So I completely understand

21:59.937 --> 22:02.356
if you came here because
you don't want to marry me any longer.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.733
And you don't have to worry
about protecting my feelings--

22:04.816 --> 22:06.651
Kala, please, just listen.

22:07.527 --> 22:11.198
For me, what happened at the banquet
was a part of the story.

22:11.282 --> 22:14.618
I'm here because I'm hoping
that it's not the end of our story.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.955
For me, I love what happened.

22:18.038 --> 22:20.707
I love it because it makes
our wedding something special.

22:20.791 --> 22:23.794
Everyone else looks at pictures
of their wedding

22:23.877 --> 22:25.670
and the story is always the same.

22:25.754 --> 22:27.172
They have nothing to say.

22:27.256 --> 22:29.758
But I imagine telling our children
how their beautiful mother

22:29.841 --> 22:32.719
took one look at their father
and fainted straight away.

22:35.347 --> 22:37.641
It is a great twist.

22:37.724 --> 22:40.519
You can see why we have to
get married now, can't you?

23:06.504 --> 23:07.796
[Silas] Van Damme.

23:07.879 --> 23:10.257
I hear your mother continues to improve.

23:10.341 --> 23:14.219
Yes. The medicine is helping.
Thank you.

23:14.303 --> 23:16.930
There's no "thank you" necessary.

23:17.014 --> 23:19.558
I'm not in the business of charity.

23:20.476 --> 23:24.563
You're thinking,
"What will he have me deliver this time?

23:24.646 --> 23:30.652
Drugs? Weapons? More coconuts?"
[chuckles]

23:38.494 --> 23:42.122
- Amondi. How are you?
- I'm good.

23:42.206 --> 23:43.790
I'd like you to meet someone.

23:44.749 --> 23:47.252
- This is Capheus.
- Hi.

23:47.336 --> 23:48.504
Hello.

23:49.463 --> 23:52.299
Wow! What have you made, my dear?

23:52.383 --> 23:55.719
- It's a home of the Little Mermaid.
- I love it.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.597
This is the sort of place I wish I lived.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.931
Me, too.

24:01.058 --> 24:02.476
Why don't you get your camera,

24:02.560 --> 24:05.979
so you can take a picture of it
and ask how much it'll cost to build?

24:06.063 --> 24:08.524
- Really?
- It never hurts to ask.

24:16.740 --> 24:20.619
My daughter, Amondi,
does not see me as someone to fear.

24:21.870 --> 24:24.789
She sees me only as Papa.

24:28.335 --> 24:29.836
[sighs]

24:30.921 --> 24:32.881
She has leukemia.

24:34.258 --> 24:38.512
To combat this, she receives
induction therapy, stem cell therapy,

24:38.596 --> 24:43.016
at the World Health Organization Center
on the Nakuru Road. You know it?

24:43.767 --> 24:45.644
My cars are known to my enemies.

24:45.727 --> 24:48.313
The road to Nakuru is long.

24:48.397 --> 24:51.442
No one would think to look for her
in that pile of shit you call a bus.

24:54.653 --> 24:57.697
She's the most important thing
in the world to me, Capheus.

24:59.324 --> 25:03.412
Everything I do
is to build a life for her.

25:04.413 --> 25:07.707
Every breath I take,
I breathe for her.

25:07.791 --> 25:10.335
Without her, my life has no meaning.

25:14.673 --> 25:20.345
And if something happens to her...
neither will yours.

25:21.430 --> 25:25.350
Prosecution submits the defendant
has violated 356 and 231

25:25.434 --> 25:26.893
of the Korean penal code.

25:26.977 --> 25:30.272
We also confirm the interrogation record,
signed by the defendant.

25:30.355 --> 25:32.691
[man] Your Honor, my client
has signed the confession,

25:32.774 --> 25:36.695
but wishes to pursue a jury trial
for purpose of latitude in sentencing.

25:36.778 --> 25:41.741
In order to properly prepare our case,
we ask for the right to post bail.

25:43.076 --> 25:47.414
- Does the prosecution object?
- Yes, we do, Your Honor.

25:47.498 --> 25:51.751
Of the 30 billion won
the defendant stole from investors,

25:51.835 --> 25:53.837
most remains unaccounted for.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.090
It would be easy for someone with
Ms. Bak's connections to flee the country.

25:57.174 --> 26:00.010
My client has a clean record,
and has willingly cooperated--

26:00.093 --> 26:02.012
Only after the investigation began,
Your Honor,

26:02.095 --> 26:04.723
when exposure became inevitable.

26:07.601 --> 26:11.647
I concur. Bail is denied.

26:13.231 --> 26:14.941
[gavel slams]

26:15.025 --> 26:16.860
[crowd murmurs]

26:40.425 --> 26:43.345
All I'm saying is... guys are talking.

26:43.428 --> 26:44.846
What guys?

26:44.929 --> 26:47.349
Just guys.

26:47.432 --> 26:49.351
If someone's got a problem with me,
I should know.

26:49.434 --> 26:51.144
It'll just piss you off.

26:51.228 --> 26:53.689
All right. You know what?
I don't give a shit anyway.

26:53.772 --> 26:55.357
That's your problem.

26:56.233 --> 27:00.904
I saw Sobczak's eyes
after your exorcist act,

27:00.987 --> 27:04.700
and if I were you,
I'd start giving a shit.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.372
And what about you?
You think I'm crazy?

27:10.455 --> 27:14.000
Oh, yeah. But I like 'em crazy.

27:14.084 --> 27:15.460
[laughs]

27:20.716 --> 27:23.260

27:24.969 --> 27:26.846

- [overlapping chatter]

27:27.514 --> 27:29.933
Wham-bam, there comes our man.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.602
We are locked and loaded, partner!

27:31.685 --> 27:32.977
Look at the Rat Van. [laughs]

27:33.061 --> 27:35.188
Sinking ship. [mocking laugh]

27:35.272 --> 27:36.648
[Capheus] Sorry, Jela.

27:36.732 --> 27:38.776
- The Van Damn is taken today.
- What?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.778
- Get these people off the bus.
- Are you crazy?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.196
It is also taken for tomorrow
and the day after,

27:43.280 --> 27:45.657
- chartered for private use.
- By who?

27:45.741 --> 27:47.576
Silas Kabaka.

27:48.452 --> 27:50.829
He paid a week in advance.

27:50.912 --> 27:52.414
Here.

27:52.497 --> 27:54.291
- You mustn't do this.
- I have to.

27:54.374 --> 27:56.710
He can get medicine for my mother.

27:56.794 --> 27:58.169
Real medicine I cannot afford.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.215
Take the money, please.

28:04.676 --> 28:06.052
[sighs]

28:16.772 --> 28:18.607
Remove all clothing.

28:18.690 --> 28:21.192
The shower is there.
You have two minutes.

28:25.029 --> 28:26.824
You're shy.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.867
There are no doors.

28:29.868 --> 28:33.079
You gave up your right to privacy
the minute you arrived here.

28:44.090 --> 28:48.512
We are on the location of
Even Angels Must Earn Their Wings

28:48.595 --> 28:51.222
with its star, Lito Rodriquez.

28:51.306 --> 28:58.104
So, Lito, can we get a little
up close and personal here?

28:58.188 --> 29:00.732
Sexual history.

29:01.817 --> 29:04.862
- Any STDs?
- No.

29:04.944 --> 29:09.407
- Cold sores? Crabs? Lice?
- No.

29:09.491 --> 29:12.202
Have you ever been checked for HIV?

29:17.415 --> 29:18.375
Excuse me?

29:19.250 --> 29:20.919
What about family?

29:21.002 --> 29:23.171
What about them?

29:23.254 --> 29:26.591
- Family is very important to me.
- Answer the question.

29:26.675 --> 29:29.135
When was your last intercourse?

29:31.388 --> 29:33.097
Some time ago.

29:33.181 --> 29:36.768
Well, Lito, we don't have a lot of time,
so I'll have to be direct.

29:37.561 --> 29:40.605
Stand up,
and remove your underwear.

29:43.859 --> 29:48.112
And squat over... this mirror.

29:51.616 --> 29:53.618
Hey, whoa, no, no, no. Hey.

29:53.702 --> 29:55.495
I'm not doing that.

29:59.332 --> 30:02.043
You're not doing what?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.005
Oh, my God, Christina.

30:08.592 --> 30:11.261
There is a line,
there's a line in the script,

30:11.344 --> 30:12.763
and I think that was--

30:12.846 --> 30:16.934
[laughs]
That was just an actor's reflex.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.603
- Oh! [laughs]
- I'm sorry, I-- Can we do that again?

30:19.686 --> 30:22.313
- Would you mind? Are you still rolling?
- Yes, please!

30:22.397 --> 30:24.232
Keep rolling, guys. Keep rolling. OK.

30:24.315 --> 30:27.945
Um... Let's just cut to the chase.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.989
You've been involved
in some of the steamiest scenes

30:31.072 --> 30:34.033
we've ever seen on television.

30:34.117 --> 30:38.663
What is the secret to be a great lover?

30:40.039 --> 30:42.166
I've never thought about it.

30:42.250 --> 30:43.961
But, I guess...

30:52.719 --> 30:54.679
First, you have to be selfless.

30:56.180 --> 31:00.769
The pleasure of your lover
must become your own.

31:01.937 --> 31:07.275
But at the same time,
you must also remain... selfish,

31:07.358 --> 31:12.530
because wanting someone so much
that it feels the same as the need...

31:13.824 --> 31:15.700
to eat...

31:16.576 --> 31:18.578
or to breathe...

31:21.122 --> 31:24.542
this is where desire
becomes love, I guess.

31:25.376 --> 31:26.586
[exhales]

31:29.088 --> 31:33.051
Did you get that? OK. Yeah, yeah.

- 'Morning, Amondi.

You can call me Diana Prince.

31:50.986 --> 31:52.988
Ah! Wonder Woman.

31:53.071 --> 31:56.366
Shh! They call it a secret identity
for a reason.

31:56.449 --> 31:58.451
OK, OK, got it.

[clears throat]

32:28.523 --> 32:34.071
Mm... I don't know if it's the fact
that I still have my brain,

32:34.153 --> 32:38.491
- or that you saved my life...
- Mm...

[â™ª Fatboy Slim Featuring Macy Gray:
"Demons"]

32:42.579 --> 32:44.081
...or...

32:45.916 --> 32:52.213
the fact that...
I'm laying here in your bedroom,

32:52.296 --> 32:55.258
thinking about you sneaking out
as a teenager.

32:55.341 --> 32:59.262
Mm-mm. Out of that very window.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.722

Hello, ladies. Lookin' good! Strong.

33:28.083 --> 33:30.585
Come on, push it.
Five more, five more.

When I first got assigned to you...

and gut dripping over his Bat belt.

34:25.223 --> 34:29.144

38:41.187 --> 38:44.065
why these people, why these minds?

38:44.148 --> 38:47.360
Why not a mind that feels, I don't know,
more in sync with my own?

38:47.444 --> 38:50.654
- Maybe that's the point.
- How so?

38:51.697 --> 38:53.783
I teach a class on evolution
every semester,

38:53.866 --> 38:57.954
and we talk about the engine of evolution,
which is variation.

38:58.037 --> 39:02.708
I imagine that to be something more than
what evolution would define as "yourself,"

39:02.792 --> 39:05.544
you'd need something different
from yourself.

how all of these emotions,

39:39.870 --> 39:41.998
they just come bubbling up out of nowhere.

39:42.081 --> 39:44.167
Sounds like menopause.

39:44.250 --> 39:47.170
Emotions are connected to the nervous
system, which would be affected by

39:47.253 --> 39:51.799
- what is happening to your brain.
- Yeah. 'Cause what I want to know,

39:51.882 --> 39:55.178
is there a way that I can stop it
from happening, or at least control it?

39:55.261 --> 39:59.056
Like ADD, where I can take a drug
and limit the effect that it has on me?

39:59.682 --> 40:02.143
Or is it like Alzheimer's,

40:02.226 --> 40:06.481
and that sense of me-ness will slowly,
inevitably disintegrate?

41:42.619 --> 41:46.289
I would kill for a cigarette. [sighs]

41:47.957 --> 41:51.502
- All I got is hash.
- What is hash?

41:52.420 --> 41:55.381
It's like pot, but better.

42:02.012 --> 42:04.014
Will this work?

42:04.098 --> 42:05.516
Can't hurt to try.

42:15.276 --> 42:17.403
I can taste it...

42:18.571 --> 42:22.450
but it's more like a... memory.

42:25.869 --> 42:27.163
It makes you feel good?

42:28.623 --> 42:30.207
Sometimes.

42:32.376 --> 42:35.254
In Iceland, we have a saying that

42:35.338 --> 42:37.298
it's not the drugs
that make a drug addict,

42:37.381 --> 42:39.925
it's the need to escape reality.

42:41.051 --> 42:42.970
I understand.

42:46.140 --> 42:48.058
Why are you here?

42:49.143 --> 42:51.312
If you don't mind me asking.

42:53.731 --> 42:55.149
[sighs]

42:56.359 --> 43:00.196
I'm afraid I've just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

43:05.284 --> 43:06.536
[man on screen] Ah!

43:08.162 --> 43:10.456
- [man yells on screen]
- Time to go?

43:10.540 --> 43:12.916
Good, let's go.

43:13.584 --> 43:16.086
Watching Van Damme again?

43:16.170 --> 43:17.672
Ah, yes.

43:17.755 --> 43:20.216
Jean-Claude is a source of inspiration.

43:20.299 --> 43:22.009
Inspiration to do what?

43:26.180 --> 43:29.933
To believe you can make a difference,
that if you are brave,

43:30.017 --> 43:33.521
you can fight to make the world
a more equal and just place.

43:33.604 --> 43:36.524
Hm. I like Jean-Claude.

43:36.607 --> 43:39.026
He wants to do the same thing
my dad wants to do.

43:39.109 --> 43:41.779
- Really?
- Yes.

43:41.862 --> 43:46.283
My dad says there are a lot of bad people
trying to hurt us and take our home away.

43:46.367 --> 43:50.037
So we have to be brave and fight,
just like Jean-Claude.

43:53.791 --> 43:57.754
So we are both in trouble
because of someone else's crime.

43:59.171 --> 44:01.758
I knew Jacks was no good.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.301
I knew what Joong-Ki was doing.

44:05.094 --> 44:06.679
Why are we here?

44:12.059 --> 44:14.645
Have you heard of the Hidden People?

44:23.529 --> 44:28.158
In Iceland, there are small people,

44:28.242 --> 44:30.911
like elves, who live in the land.

44:32.580 --> 44:36.333
When I was young, I went into a cave
and I heard one singing.

44:38.711 --> 44:42.840
She was singing a song my mother
used to sing to me when I was young.

44:45.342 --> 44:49.972
It's quite a terrible song
about a mother having to kill her baby,

44:50.055 --> 44:52.600
but I always found it so comforting.

44:54.435 --> 44:57.563
I heard her voice
several times over the years.

45:01.108 --> 45:07.239
She told me I was born with a hex,
and that if I stayed in Iceland,

45:07.323 --> 45:12.620
bad things would happen to me,
and to the people that I loved.

45:21.378 --> 45:24.006
And then my mother died, and...

45:25.800 --> 45:28.093
And I believed it was my fault.

45:33.140 --> 45:36.352
My mother died when I was young, too.

45:38.312 --> 45:42.525
I had no voice telling me
that I was hexed,

45:42.608 --> 45:48.280
but I still believed
somehow it was my fault.

45:56.038 --> 46:00.042
Oh, I want to go home. [sighs]

46:00.125 --> 46:02.795
I want to see my father.

46:03.796 --> 46:05.381
You should go.

46:05.464 --> 46:07.299
I'm afraid.

46:09.051 --> 46:11.303
Don't be.

46:11.387 --> 46:15.265
Right now, you're safer there
than where you are.

46:20.437 --> 46:23.524
Tomorrow, I go to prison.

46:24.692 --> 46:26.569
Are you afraid?

46:34.117 --> 46:35.369
Don't be.

46:36.954 --> 46:37.955
Why?

46:40.165 --> 46:43.210
Because you're safer there
than where you were.

47:18.913 --> 47:21.665
Mm... Mm!

47:21.749 --> 47:23.417
What was that for?

47:24.418 --> 47:26.253
I don't know.

47:26.336 --> 47:29.089
Just felt like something
I needed to do.

47:33.176 --> 47:34.553
I like that.

48:03.540 --> 48:05.709
My child.

48:06.877 --> 48:09.755
So beautiful and strong.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.009
I'll always love you.

48:14.802 --> 48:17.721
Remember to be careful, child.

48:19.556 --> 48:25.562
They are afraid of you,
and they will hurt you if they find out.

48:26.522 --> 48:28.315
Find out?

48:30.860 --> 48:32.778
What you are.

48:34.279 --> 48:35.781
What am I?

48:40.327 --> 48:41.495
[whispers] The future.
