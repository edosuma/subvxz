00:03.521 --> 00:05.095
Previously on Rogue...

00:05.122 --> 00:06.963
- The money's gone.
- Holy shit.

00:06.974 --> 00:07.667
They found the money.

00:07.668 --> 00:09.396
It's only a matter of time
before they know everything.

00:09.672 --> 00:12.290
Kendra was Massoud tying up loose ends.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.908
- What next?
- That money is flagged.

00:14.919 --> 00:16.325
This guy, Ray Williams,

00:16.337 --> 00:18.246
he's been feeding them
information from the Treasury

00:18.269 --> 00:20.098
about where Cheat's money is showing up.

00:20.098 --> 00:22.121
You killed him? You killed Cheat?

00:22.241 --> 00:23.465
Spud!

00:27.518 --> 00:29.542
- You kissed Billy?
- Is that what he told you?

00:29.554 --> 00:31.760
- Oh, my God! You did!
- No.

00:31.772 --> 00:34.001
- What? You can't get any men of your own?
- Just... listen to me.

00:34.001 --> 00:34.653
Stop it!

00:34.676 --> 00:35.986
Ethan gave money to the families

00:35.987 --> 00:38.030
of two of the soldiers who
died in the Chinook crash.

00:38.047 --> 00:41.016
Can your contact at the Pentagon
get us a manifest of the flight?

00:41.044 --> 00:42.565
We can talk to the other families.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.828
Oh, I think I'm owed
some kind of explanation.

00:44.948 --> 00:48.063
- About what?
- Stealing Chetowski's money.

00:48.384 --> 00:50.533
Faking your own death.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.033
I'm done listening to you.

00:58.046 --> 00:59.434
Well, good luck, Ray.

00:59.536 --> 01:01.578
I'm sure you'll do just fine on your own.

01:53.690 --> 01:56.674
Now we have Ray there on
12 and Spud at the six.

01:56.794 --> 01:58.366
- Now are we all clear?
- Yeah.

01:58.389 --> 02:00.070
As a fucking bell.

02:00.504 --> 02:03.305
- Let's do it.
- Let's start getting geared up. Let's go.

02:05.249 --> 02:07.056
Are you okay, buddy?

02:07.936 --> 02:10.074
Yeah, yeah. Of course, man.

02:10.577 --> 02:12.212
I just...

02:12.332 --> 02:13.775
I um...

02:15.768 --> 02:18.672
I didn't wanna tell you guys
until she was three months.

02:18.681 --> 02:21.030
- What?
- Connie's pregnant.

02:21.038 --> 02:24.102
- Oh, man, come here.
- Holy goddamn.

02:24.399 --> 02:27.247
- Sure it's yours?
- Hey, shut the fuck up, asshole.

02:27.269 --> 02:30.036
I'm just messin' with
you. Hey, get a glass.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.364
- Cheers.
- You and Connie.

02:41.858 --> 02:43.739
You're pulling out, aren't you?

02:51.347 --> 02:53.485
I'm gonna be a father, guys.

02:54.801 --> 02:56.585
I gotta... you know.

02:56.686 --> 02:58.059
I gotta be responsible.

02:58.070 --> 03:00.448
Spud, man, come on. This
is being responsible.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.535
I'm doing this for Alice and
April, to give them a future.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.434
Look, you do this,

03:08.028 --> 03:09.892
you'll never have to worry any more.

03:10.372 --> 03:11.836
None of us do.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.842
This fuckin' money, man...

03:15.723 --> 03:17.598
We're gonna live the good life.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.761
Guys, we can't tell him what to do.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.758
Alright, let's roll.

03:34.878 --> 03:37.319
Stay focused and follow the plan.

03:38.611 --> 03:40.772
Guys, I've been... I've been thinking...

03:42.725 --> 03:45.222
- Maybe Spud's right.
- What?

03:47.262 --> 03:49.192
Maybe this is a bad idea.

03:53.628 --> 03:56.701
- No, I'm just fucking with you.
- Motherfucker!

03:56.737 --> 03:58.712
Let's go get rich, boys!

04:00.551 --> 04:02.308
Ray, lead us some prayer.

04:08.902 --> 04:10.677
God, keep us safe at this time

04:10.693 --> 04:13.723
and grant us a safe and speedy
return home to our families. Amen.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.396
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:16.129 --> 04:17.620
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:18.853 --> 04:20.216
Wait.

04:29.354 --> 04:31.851
I'm coming with you, man.

04:31.860 --> 04:33.963
Yeah, you are. You little munchkin.

04:33.964 --> 04:35.363
You motherfucker.

05:06.462 --> 05:08.227
Fucker!

05:16.759 --> 05:18.600
Fuck...

05:22.378 --> 05:23.841
This was all your fault.

05:23.961 --> 05:26.219
- Right from the start.
- Fuck you, Ray.

05:26.229 --> 05:27.307
Come on, Eth.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.134
We didn't have to kill them.
We could have walked away.

05:30.254 --> 05:32.155
I was protecting us and you know it.

05:32.155 --> 05:33.472
Protecting us?

05:34.213 --> 05:37.790
We were fucked when you
fired the first shot.

05:38.494 --> 05:40.360
And we've been fucked ever since.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.544
Ahh! Uh!

06:29.284 --> 06:31.937
I want everything labeled and packed,

06:31.983 --> 06:36.437
every document, every computer,
every plant and humidifier. Go.

06:38.843 --> 06:40.407
Be careful with those.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.078
Shit!

06:48.401 --> 06:50.057
Do what you can.

06:56.705 --> 06:57.766
Fuck!

06:58.379 --> 06:59.641
Where is he?

06:59.952 --> 07:02.541
- Ray's not here, Ethan.
- What about Donna? Where's she at?

07:02.568 --> 07:03.866
She went out.

07:03.986 --> 07:06.501
Where's the money, Connie?
Where... where did they hide it?

07:06.602 --> 07:08.158
I thought that you guys gave that back.

07:08.158 --> 07:10.170
- How long has she been gone for?
- A little while.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.579
Wait.

07:12.310 --> 07:13.929
Is this about what Spud did?

07:16.839 --> 07:18.284
Is this about Spud?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.924
You really want to know
what happened to Spud?

07:22.738 --> 07:23.890
Ask Ray.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.948
Wait, what? What does that even mean?

07:26.068 --> 07:27.448
Ethan!

07:32.424 --> 07:34.500
Evie. Honey, are you up here?

07:34.884 --> 07:36.887
Hey.

07:39.448 --> 07:40.966
I'm going to get dad.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.916
- Evie...
- No, I want a witness.

07:42.952 --> 07:44.068
Listen,

07:45.595 --> 07:47.196
I should never have hit you.

07:47.242 --> 07:48.897
Take you two days to figure that out?

07:49.017 --> 07:50.452
Look, I know you're upset, sweetie.

07:50.489 --> 07:52.263
You don't know anything. You were at work.

07:52.785 --> 07:54.339
- Like always.
- I know.

07:54.586 --> 07:55.657
I'm sorry.

07:55.777 --> 07:58.234
- If you were sorry, you'd have been here.
- I should have been.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.618
I made a mistake.

08:00.331 --> 08:01.749
I got my priorities wrong.

08:01.758 --> 08:03.651
- Understatement of the fucking century.
- Hey.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.495
I'm here.

08:06.523 --> 08:08.160
You know, sometimes I think the only way

08:08.179 --> 08:09.871
I could get your attention is to die.

08:13.685 --> 08:15.075
That's not fair.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.547
Isn't it?

08:19.803 --> 08:21.184
I'm going to school.

08:23.251 --> 08:24.668
Evie...

08:28.126 --> 08:30.120
Sorry, I just have to make
sure you're on the list.

08:30.156 --> 08:30.874
It's no problem.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.369
I've picked them up before
when Ray had to work, so...

08:33.376 --> 08:35.136
Again, my condolences.

08:35.443 --> 08:38.096
Yeah, well, it's been quite a
shock to all of us. I appreciate it.

08:38.424 --> 08:41.910
Maggie. Could you bring Alice and
April Williams to reception, please?

08:41.937 --> 08:43.164
Yes, ma'am.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.809
Thank you.

08:50.855 --> 08:52.227
How's the recovery coming?

08:52.502 --> 08:53.965
Touch and go.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.010
I think you need to take a look at this.

09:01.748 --> 09:03.356
We've been piecing this together

09:03.357 --> 09:05.539
from some of the shredded
material we found.

09:08.290 --> 09:10.199
I pulled this off of APP.

09:13.245 --> 09:14.837
Notice anything strange?

09:15.111 --> 09:16.885
- It's been doctored.
- Yeah.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.081
- So who's the guy underneath?
- I don't know.

09:19.099 --> 09:21.706
But the guy in the middle, he
looks like our man of mystery,

09:21.724 --> 09:23.304
Hakim Shah Massoud.

09:23.406 --> 09:25.554
Mid-level opium trafficker out of Pakistan.

09:25.748 --> 09:28.324
Controls most of Mingora
and a few outposts.

09:28.337 --> 09:31.557
This is great. Dig up
everything you can on this guy.

09:31.584 --> 09:32.847
Then get on to Langley.

09:32.856 --> 09:34.932
See if we can put him in a
room together with our boys

09:34.950 --> 09:37.466
sometime in the last five years.

09:40.576 --> 09:41.774
Maggie.

09:41.894 --> 09:45.293
- Have you seen Alice?
- Oh, I thought she left with her sister.

09:45.394 --> 09:48.421
- What?
- She left with her sister 20 minutes ago.

09:48.439 --> 09:49.765
Their uncle came to get them.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.711
Is everything okay?

09:54.512 --> 09:55.647
Yeah.

10:02.843 --> 10:04.343
- Hello.
- Ethan.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.227
Ethan, where are my girls?

10:06.347 --> 10:08.304
They're fine. Alice,
don't... don't drip it.

10:08.350 --> 10:10.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ***

10:10.472 --> 10:13.088
I don't know what's
going on with you and Ray,

10:13.106 --> 10:14.762
- but...
- Donna, don't play games with me.

10:14.789 --> 10:16.106
Where is he?

10:16.563 --> 10:18.987
Where is he?

10:19.636 --> 10:21.557
I'm sorry, Ethan.

10:21.941 --> 10:24.081
He called me, he told me
I had to get the money.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.175
- He tried to kill me.
- Ethan, please.

10:26.194 --> 10:27.699
Meet me at Ridley Park in 30 minutes.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.970
We'll have ourselves a little trade.

10:29.644 --> 10:30.996
Okay.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.439
I'm sorry.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.140
Not yet, you're not.

10:43.198 --> 10:44.634
You guys have fun?

10:44.754 --> 10:46.202
Give me a hug. Come here.

10:46.322 --> 10:48.404
It was great to see you. Alright.

10:48.524 --> 10:49.938
- Hey.
- Mommy.

10:51.887 --> 10:54.910
- Did you have fun with your Uncle Ethan?
- We had hot dogs.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.323
Go get in the car.

10:57.932 --> 11:00.173
- This is all Ray's fault.
- Bullshit.

11:00.731 --> 11:02.990
- You took my kids.
- It didn't have to be this way, Donna.

11:47.148 --> 11:48.995
Stay in the fucking car.

11:51.053 --> 11:52.387
What are you doing, man?

11:52.398 --> 11:54.428
- You just went right into him.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, yeah.

11:54.428 --> 11:56.741
Sorry, you know I was texting.
Stupid, I know. But thank you.

11:56.769 --> 11:57.873
We're good. Thank you.

11:57.993 --> 12:00.976
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, no, no. It's alright. It's alright.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.332
Really got to stop that bleeding.

12:04.644 --> 12:06.839
- Get the fuck off me.
- Fucking open it.

12:09.346 --> 12:10.691
Open it.

12:11.167 --> 12:13.362
Rather not involve the insurance company.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.203
Uh, yeah, yeah, maybe.

12:17.846 --> 12:19.975
I mean, the damage seems about even.

12:19.993 --> 12:22.856
- Say we 50-50 split?
- Fuck off.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.281
Yeah, I saw the whole thing, man.

12:24.282 --> 12:25.068
I'll make a statement and shit.

12:25.169 --> 12:26.765
Hey, asshole, why don't
you back the fuck up

12:26.766 --> 12:28.041
before I run you down too, uh?

12:28.096 --> 12:29.514
Relax, man.

12:36.593 --> 12:37.937
Alright, you take one bag,

12:37.938 --> 12:39.850
I'll let you walk away
from here. You take two,

12:39.970 --> 12:41.487
I'll shoot you where you fucking stand.

12:41.514 --> 12:42.987
- Do you hear me?
- That's not gonna work for me.

12:43.024 --> 12:45.548
Let me be perfectly clear.
I'm happy either way.

12:49.380 --> 12:51.338
How did it get this bad, Ray?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.292
Guess that's a mystery...

12:54.576 --> 12:56.725
Uncle Ethan.

12:57.695 --> 12:59.053
Fuck...

12:59.154 --> 13:01.389
- I've got that on camera, man.
- Fuck you.

13:03.887 --> 13:05.908
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.495
So you're back from vacation?

13:25.514 --> 13:28.302
Turns out I'm not much for coffee
shops and the great outdoors.

13:28.623 --> 13:30.680
Then you'll love where you're going next.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.580
The five million dollars
that you're looking for?

13:33.589 --> 13:35.776
Ray's got it. He almost killed me for it.

13:35.896 --> 13:37.392
I thought it was 10.

13:37.493 --> 13:39.635
They're headed south on the 280.

13:39.755 --> 13:41.025
Go find out.

13:41.985 --> 13:44.967
If this is some sort of diversion,
it's a really lame attempt.

13:44.985 --> 13:47.427
Look, pick him up or don't pick
him up. I don't give a shit.

13:48.067 --> 13:49.613
You're the one who called me.

13:50.317 --> 13:54.089
You want SFPD to run interference
on your little civil war,

13:54.388 --> 13:55.870
I wanna talk first.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.504
- Where are you?
- I'm headed to the hospital.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.763
- Hospital?
- Yeah.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.017
We need to talk.

14:08.428 --> 14:10.539
Connie, I think it's time
you and Kyle went home.

14:10.796 --> 14:12.470
Ethan was here.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.864
He was upset. Said some horrible things.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.919
Spud didn't steal that money, did he?

14:21.672 --> 14:23.373
And he didn't hang himself.

14:26.501 --> 14:27.873
I knew it.

14:28.358 --> 14:30.699
I knew he didn't. I knew
he wasn't that type of man.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.535
You have no fucking idea
what type of man he was.

14:33.553 --> 14:36.115
Maybe not. But I know exactly
what type of men you are.

14:37.580 --> 14:40.177
- Ray, you gotta go. You gotta go!
- Give me the fucking money!

14:40.297 --> 14:42.188
You gotta go, Ray!

14:42.191 --> 14:44.659
Ray, you gotta go!

14:45.545 --> 14:46.963
Fuck!

14:48.600 --> 14:49.945
He's in there.

14:51.326 --> 14:52.467
Hey...

14:55.170 --> 14:57.253
- Freeze!
- Police! Stop!

15:07.286 --> 15:08.777
Anything from Ethan?

15:09.184 --> 15:10.195
No.

15:10.945 --> 15:12.509
I'm thinking Mexico.

15:13.039 --> 15:14.704
Better than Canada.

15:15.344 --> 15:17.058
Think we finally found our guy.

15:17.159 --> 15:19.057
Hakim Shah Massoud.

15:19.258 --> 15:20.969
He's a dope trafficker out of Pakistan.

15:20.996 --> 15:22.222
It's still a little sketchy.

15:22.231 --> 15:24.865
I had to cobble it together
from Pakistani news sources.

15:24.874 --> 15:26.511
So why is he coming after Kelly?

15:26.516 --> 15:29.098
Seems the CIA's been paying
off Pakistani warlords

15:29.133 --> 15:31.099
to stop fighting our
boys in the Swat Valley.

15:32.555 --> 15:34.347
Maybe this money was meant for him.

15:36.082 --> 15:37.626
I'll kick this Intel up,

15:37.746 --> 15:39.053
see where we land.

15:39.478 --> 15:41.907
It still doesn't explain why
Kelly has been giving money

15:41.928 --> 15:43.531
to families from that Chinook crash.

15:43.911 --> 15:45.286
What Chinook crash?

15:45.689 --> 15:49.391
uh, the transport helicopter went
down over Afghanistan a year ago.

15:49.764 --> 15:52.816
And our boy's been charitable to a
couple of the families of the victims.

15:52.936 --> 15:54.185
This is good work.

15:55.202 --> 15:56.256
Keep on it.

15:58.693 --> 15:59.593
Hey.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.012
How's your kid?

16:01.481 --> 16:02.447
Mm.

16:02.893 --> 16:03.895
Don't ask.

16:11.863 --> 16:13.824
Sir.

16:14.797 --> 16:15.960
Yes, sir.

16:16.648 --> 16:18.273
Hakim Shah Massoud.

16:21.338 --> 16:23.819
I thought this money
was for reconstruction.

16:24.434 --> 16:27.587
Is it possible it was meant
for a Pakistani warlord?

16:27.792 --> 16:30.361
What do you think reconstruction
means, Deputy Director?

16:31.114 --> 16:33.031
- Yes, sir. Of course, sir.
- Anything else?

16:33.046 --> 16:34.963
They mentioned something
about a Chinook crash

16:34.985 --> 16:36.829
over Afghanistan about a year ago.

16:36.844 --> 16:38.439
Does that mean anything to you?

16:40.312 --> 16:41.424
Shut it down.

16:41.665 --> 16:42.580
Excuse me?

16:42.990 --> 16:45.112
Shut the task force down. Now.

16:46.955 --> 16:48.149
Understood, sir.

17:00.078 --> 17:01.697
You crocheting a sweater down there?

17:02.758 --> 17:03.998
All done.

17:16.011 --> 17:18.060
Well done. There we go.

17:18.388 --> 17:20.026
Okay. I can get up.

17:20.849 --> 17:22.597
Hey, hey, take it easy.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.563
I'll be back to discharge you in a second.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.930
I prefer you as a blonde.

17:51.976 --> 17:53.439
Yeah, I get that a lot.

17:55.121 --> 17:56.621
You pick up Ray yet?

17:57.499 --> 17:58.725
We'll find him.

17:59.228 --> 18:00.801
We got the cash, though.

18:01.386 --> 18:02.667
Thanks for that.

18:03.088 --> 18:04.322
Yeah, sure.

18:04.752 --> 18:06.619
So you wanna get anything off your chest?

18:06.911 --> 18:08.110
Like what?

18:08.384 --> 18:10.625
Well, you just handed
me five million dollars.

18:10.643 --> 18:13.131
Your friends are either
dead or trying to kill you.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.841
I assume you got a story to tell.

18:15.116 --> 18:16.908
Well, I'm sure when you
pick up Ray, he'll...

18:16.917 --> 18:18.115
fill you in on the details.

18:18.124 --> 18:20.731
Right, and I'm sure you'll
be around when he does.

18:21.545 --> 18:23.969
You know what? Maybe we
should just take you in now.

18:23.987 --> 18:25.826
- Mm.
- To be safe.

18:26.393 --> 18:28.231
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

18:28.478 --> 18:29.987
You abducted a police officer.

18:30.015 --> 18:31.843
You mean the woman who faked her own death,

18:31.871 --> 18:34.285
stole $2.5m and fled to Canada?

18:34.578 --> 18:36.270
I think I'll take my chances.

18:41.374 --> 18:42.718
You know, Grace,

18:43.029 --> 18:46.359
the FBI sent two undercover agents.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.017
They bugged our computers and
they still don't have shit on us.

18:51.389 --> 18:53.054
How'd you find out my name?

18:54.005 --> 18:55.432
Cathy Laszlo.

18:56.776 --> 18:58.679
That family's got a real thing for you.

18:59.447 --> 19:02.219
- You know, I'm fine. I'll walk. Thanks.
- Sorry.

19:02.265 --> 19:04.158
Protocol. Insurance purposes. Come on.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.838
I'm not done with you yet.

19:07.268 --> 19:08.960
I heard that was your MO.

19:11.137 --> 19:12.362
Let me ask you a question.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.189
Were you gonna fuck me for information

19:15.309 --> 19:16.863
like you did Jimmy Laszlo?

19:18.290 --> 19:19.534
So long, Grace.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.955
What the hell's going on?

19:42.701 --> 19:44.549
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.512
San Francisco operation's a wrap.

19:48.152 --> 19:49.263
What?

19:50.585 --> 19:52.667
They're shredding our evidence.

19:52.768 --> 19:54.225
It's not our evidence.

19:54.269 --> 19:56.256
It belongs to the federal government.

19:56.772 --> 19:58.506
What? You approved of this?

19:59.036 --> 20:01.020
This is a win for you, Travis.

20:01.048 --> 20:02.667
And those have been in short supply.

20:02.685 --> 20:04.213
I think you should take it.

20:04.999 --> 20:06.472
They're not passing this up.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.673
They're shutting us
down. This is a cover-up.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.152
How can you be okay with that?

20:11.384 --> 20:13.679
- It's not my call.
- Then make it your call.

20:13.707 --> 20:15.508
What about all the work that we did?

20:15.911 --> 20:18.563
There are people more senior
and with more information

20:18.573 --> 20:20.832
that made a decision on this case.

20:22.158 --> 20:23.566
And what did they promise you?

20:25.478 --> 20:27.920
You know, there's a difference
between doing your job

20:28.040 --> 20:29.942
- and being a sellout.
- Yeah.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.570
Oh, yeah. There is.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.181
We're done here.

20:41.319 --> 20:43.961
And your secondment to the FBI is over.

20:44.437 --> 20:45.953
Thank you for your service.

20:46.073 --> 20:47.711
People have been lied to.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.752
You know, what about those families?

20:49.787 --> 20:52.157
And that poor girl in Carson City. No.

20:52.277 --> 20:55.177
- I'm not walking away.
- What is wrong with you?

20:55.404 --> 20:57.377
Why can't you just let things lie?

20:57.416 --> 20:58.587
Oh, I don't know, Leni,

20:58.596 --> 21:01.120
maybe I care more about
this case than the next one.

21:01.165 --> 21:03.415
There is not going to be a next one.

21:03.982 --> 21:05.153
You do this,

21:05.419 --> 21:08.784
I will call the DA, get him
to reopen the shooting reviews.

21:09.241 --> 21:10.825
You are looking at a jury trial

21:10.826 --> 21:13.105
for the murder of
Detective Nicholas Fleming.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.781
God. You must want that
corner office pretty bad.

21:15.809 --> 21:17.885
I don't want to do this.

21:18.947 --> 21:20.456
But be very clear,

21:20.931 --> 21:22.189
if you make me,

21:23.364 --> 21:24.525
I will.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.861
I'm not a sellout.

21:38.199 --> 21:39.442
Oakland DA.

21:42.516 --> 21:44.473
Special Agent Marlene Kastner.

22:07.549 --> 22:09.516
Donna's in custody because of you.

22:09.534 --> 22:11.611
- What are you talking about?
- They took my kids.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.047
- Who did?
- Social services.

22:13.075 --> 22:15.361
- You fucking ratted me out.
- Ray, come on.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.108
Shut the fuck up!

22:18.132 --> 22:19.847
Look, we can figure this out.

22:19.870 --> 22:20.776
They got the money, Ethan.

22:20.777 --> 22:22.317
They can pin this whole
fucking nightmare on me.

22:23.373 --> 22:24.863
I can't go back.

22:25.714 --> 22:27.488
I'll never see my family again.

22:27.507 --> 22:28.778
We'll get you out of the country.

22:28.796 --> 22:30.498
- They don't have shit on Donna. You...
- Hey.

22:31.366 --> 22:33.552
You still think anyone's listening to you?

22:35.263 --> 22:37.128
Look, Ray, I'm just trying to help you out.

22:37.988 --> 22:38.947
Easy.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.921
Fuck. You always thought you were
so much smarter than all of us,

22:41.930 --> 22:44.573
you East Coast, elitist motherfucker.

22:44.574 --> 22:46.211
I never thought that.

22:47.619 --> 22:49.320
You were never one of us.

22:50.692 --> 22:52.073
I wish that was true.

22:52.979 --> 22:55.430
- Give me the rest of the money.
- It's not here.

22:56.372 --> 22:58.650
- Where is it?
- It's at the hospital in ER.

22:58.659 --> 23:01.303
- Well, let's go get it.
- It's not like we can just go grab it.

23:01.723 --> 23:02.756
Fuck!

23:04.357 --> 23:06.835
What's the matter? Need a doctor, huh?

23:06.872 --> 23:09.323
Yeah?

23:09.364 --> 23:11.510
- Officer Travis?
- This is Travis.

23:11.536 --> 23:14.600
- We have a package for you. Should we send it... ?
- No. I don't work...

23:14.966 --> 23:16.109
Actually,

23:16.585 --> 23:18.167
yeah, send it over.

23:18.167 --> 23:19.387
Where do you want it?

23:19.676 --> 23:21.140
I'll give you the address.

23:45.477 --> 23:46.721
Ooh,

23:46.923 --> 23:48.331
handsome.

23:49.371 --> 23:50.700
Who is he?

23:51.395 --> 23:53.563
It's nothing. It's just work stuff.

23:54.203 --> 23:55.968
Why? What's wrong?

24:00.953 --> 24:02.864
I think I really messed up this time.

24:03.632 --> 24:05.608
She just needs a little space, dear.

24:07.062 --> 24:09.056
- She'll come home.
- Mom,

24:13.108 --> 24:14.736
I think I'm gonna get arrested.

24:15.404 --> 24:16.697
What?

24:19.785 --> 24:21.138
Last year,

24:22.154 --> 24:23.846
I killed a police officer.

24:25.611 --> 24:26.397
I...

24:27.349 --> 24:28.529
I don't...

24:29.416 --> 24:32.562
I... I... I don't know
how to respond to that.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.553
I didn't ask you to respond. It's okay.

24:35.590 --> 24:37.327
Are you being serious?

24:44.113 --> 24:45.147
Why?

24:48.357 --> 24:49.976
Because he murdered Sam.

24:51.961 --> 24:53.361
I found him.

24:56.872 --> 24:58.226
And I killed him.

25:00.439 --> 25:02.186
And I'm not sorry.

25:09.348 --> 25:10.518
Okay.

25:10.638 --> 25:11.927
Okay.

25:13.472 --> 25:14.789
Uh...

25:15.375 --> 25:16.938
We should call a lawyer.

25:17.762 --> 25:19.381
It's not gonna do anything.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.930
Because I made a choice.

25:22.930 --> 25:24.348
And it was mine.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.720
And now I just have to
live with the consequences.

25:28.766 --> 25:30.641
- I don't accept that.
- Well, you need to.

25:30.678 --> 25:33.614
No, I am not going to let
you lay down in front of this.

25:33.651 --> 25:35.343
I'm not laying down.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.629
I'm accepting responsibility.

25:37.749 --> 25:40.099
You have a 16-year-old who depends on you.

25:40.117 --> 25:42.496
That is your responsibility.

25:43.182 --> 25:45.194
You're a mother, not a martyr.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.283
I just don't think they're
going to see it like that.

26:00.414 --> 26:02.298
You did what you had to do,

26:03.121 --> 26:04.548
and...

26:05.142 --> 26:06.697
I'm proud of you.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.102
Thank you.

26:14.087 --> 26:15.049
It's okay.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.836
- She send a scout?
- Your mother doesn't know I'm here.

26:41.956 --> 26:44.873
- Welcome to my world.
- Hey. You need to go easy on her.

26:45.586 --> 26:47.077
You should talk.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.018
Evie,

26:51.138 --> 26:54.680
I told you some things about your
mother that I shouldn't have told you.

26:56.232 --> 26:59.177
And to be honest, after all these years,

27:00.485 --> 27:02.753
I'm not sure I even
remember how much is true.

27:02.873 --> 27:04.198
What do you mean?

27:04.537 --> 27:07.180
I blamed her because it was easier.

27:08.607 --> 27:12.796
Easier than admitting what a mess I
made of raising her, of our family.

27:13.628 --> 27:15.713
What a mess I made of everything.

27:16.399 --> 27:18.603
But I can't stick around anymore, Evie.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.872
I'm just getting in the way.

27:21.786 --> 27:24.631
- I'm not going back there.
- I know she's not perfect,

27:25.079 --> 27:27.302
but she's done better
by you than I did by her.

27:27.329 --> 27:28.710
Well, why don't you live with her?

27:31.555 --> 27:33.530
Well, some things you can't fix.

27:34.628 --> 27:37.070
And I just hope you two never get there.

27:39.970 --> 27:41.964
She needs you, Evie.

27:43.921 --> 27:45.202
You need each other.

27:47.753 --> 27:48.988
Now c'mon,

27:49.500 --> 27:51.028
gimme one for the road.

27:51.979 --> 27:53.314
Where're you gonna go?

27:53.698 --> 27:56.725
Oh, Marty's been begging me to come home.

27:56.945 --> 27:59.011
The poor man can barely live without me.

28:00.530 --> 28:01.947
You gonna be okay?

28:01.975 --> 28:03.027
Oh!

28:04.417 --> 28:05.798
Always, kid.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.961
Always.

28:11.972 --> 28:14.486
Lucy!

28:14.606 --> 28:15.631
Hi.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.560
Digging the new look.

28:21.402 --> 28:23.231
Yeah, thanks for that.

28:23.351 --> 28:26.030
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't
possibly be blaming me.

28:26.058 --> 28:27.677
Couldn't just let me be dead?

28:29.836 --> 28:31.647
I mean, who was I hurting, really?

28:31.903 --> 28:34.402
You know, I cried for you, asshole.

28:35.122 --> 28:37.157
Yeah, and that's 50 bucks for dog food.

28:37.555 --> 28:39.238
Geez, what are you feeding her, steaks?

28:40.490 --> 28:41.999
You know what? Forget it.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.277
No, I can take care of my own damn dog.

28:48.859 --> 28:51.831
Oh, shit. I could have sworn
I left some money in here.

28:52.435 --> 28:53.871
You take Canadian?

29:00.465 --> 29:01.992
You didn't take that with you.

29:02.285 --> 29:03.116
What?

29:04.864 --> 29:06.063
Your wallet.

29:07.224 --> 29:08.762
You did not take that

29:08.789 --> 29:10.408
with you when you went to work.

29:10.637 --> 29:13.307
Why the fuck would I
take my wallet undercover?

29:16.728 --> 29:18.401
They were undercover.

29:19.828 --> 29:20.889
Yeah.

29:23.203 --> 29:24.904
They were going on leave.

29:25.279 --> 29:28.782
They were going on leave
and they did not have any ID.

29:34.269 --> 29:36.520
- What, are you having a seizure?
- Well,

29:36.904 --> 29:38.487
it doesn't matter anyway

29:38.496 --> 29:40.673
because the taskforce has been shut down.

29:40.682 --> 29:41.990
Hey, what are you talking about?

29:42.767 --> 29:44.313
What do you care?

29:44.587 --> 29:46.489
I dunno. If I help solve this thing,

29:46.499 --> 29:48.164
I get time off for good behavior.

29:48.284 --> 29:50.706
Yeah. Your sense of duty moves me.

29:50.826 --> 29:53.952
Are you gonna fucking tell me or what?

29:55.159 --> 29:59.842
Ethan Kelly's been paying off the
families of three special ops soldiers who,

30:00.126 --> 30:02.998
who died in a helicopter
crash in Afghanistan.

30:04.241 --> 30:05.549
What, he shoot it down?

30:06.280 --> 30:08.183
It was mechanical failure.

30:09.380 --> 30:12.367
But the report said they were
supposed to be going on leave.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.630
But you don't think they were?

30:16.780 --> 30:19.743
We got hold of their
personal effects, right?

30:20.292 --> 30:21.874
And they should've been...

30:22.176 --> 30:23.959
they should have been burnt to a crisp,

30:24.444 --> 30:25.990
but they weren't.

30:26.676 --> 30:28.112
They were intact.

30:28.331 --> 30:31.569
And where was Kelly when
the helicopter went down?

30:32.968 --> 30:34.642
He was in Pakistan.

30:36.142 --> 30:37.934
So maybe they weren't on board?

30:40.989 --> 30:43.731
But why would they be
undercover in Pakistan?

30:44.071 --> 30:47.876
Because American soldiers
aren't supposed to be there.

30:48.946 --> 30:50.473
We gotta take it to Leni.

30:50.518 --> 30:52.512
The Feds aren't interested.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.793
They wanna just sweep this
whole thing under the rug.

31:01.503 --> 31:03.863
But Ethan and Ray don't know that.

31:10.449 --> 31:13.248
Right, try to take it easy this time.

31:13.368 --> 31:15.534
Yeah, bud, you really
ought to be more careful.

31:16.732 --> 31:19.009
So, the orderly will be around.

31:19.129 --> 31:20.930
Well, you know the drill.

31:21.378 --> 31:22.622
Thank you.

31:24.790 --> 31:26.775
I know where it is. Why
don't you let me handle it?

31:26.793 --> 31:29.043
No. You're not gonna be
touching that money again.

31:30.177 --> 31:31.311
Put that on.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.625
Put it on.

31:36.745 --> 31:39.058
My mother wanted me to be a doctor, Ray.

31:39.067 --> 31:41.747
Yeah, I bet she'd be real
proud of you right now.

31:49.202 --> 31:50.976
Go. Come on.

31:59.154 --> 32:01.019
How are you feeling, Mr. Clarke?

32:02.629 --> 32:05.447
It says here you have
appendicitis. Is that correct?

32:06.178 --> 32:07.861
Do you mind if I check, please?

32:10.010 --> 32:11.373
They did that already.

32:11.849 --> 32:14.008
You can't trust the
junior doctors around here.

32:14.128 --> 32:16.295
Okay, flip over on your side, will you?

32:26.713 --> 32:28.643
It looks like it's going
to have to come out.

32:28.763 --> 32:30.289
Yeah, they said that too.

32:30.409 --> 32:31.972
Well, we all agree, then.

32:32.092 --> 32:33.460
Good. You can flip back over.

32:33.947 --> 32:36.353
I'll have the nurse
come and prep you, okay?

32:44.996 --> 32:48.087
Uh, excuse me, we're
looking for Ethan Kelly.

32:48.316 --> 32:51.023
Doorman at his building said he
called him a taxi. It came here.

32:51.233 --> 32:53.172
He's in room 302.

32:53.292 --> 32:54.535
Cubicle two.

32:57.864 --> 32:59.694
You got what you wanted.

32:59.814 --> 33:01.721
- I guess this is goodbye.
- Walk in front.

33:01.934 --> 33:04.011
Actually, I'm fine right here, Ray.

33:04.477 --> 33:06.242
Oh, I know how that goes, Ethan.

33:06.699 --> 33:09.306
I let you go and you come after me? No.

33:10.110 --> 33:12.910
I'm not looking over my
shoulder. This ends today.

33:13.568 --> 33:14.665
Okay.

33:14.785 --> 33:15.955
What now?

33:16.239 --> 33:18.219
You take care of me like
you took care of Spud?

33:18.534 --> 33:20.024
No.

33:20.994 --> 33:22.732
This time I won't regret it.

33:25.778 --> 33:27.186
Excuse me...

33:28.814 --> 33:30.222
In there.

33:49.329 --> 33:50.685
Oh, shit!

33:51.305 --> 33:54.012
Okay, you take B wing. I'll go down here.

33:54.058 --> 33:55.150
Wait, I don't have a gun.

33:55.270 --> 33:56.819
What do you expect me to do if I find them?

33:57.587 --> 33:58.786
Yell.

34:02.636 --> 34:05.270
- You'd shoot me in a public building?
- Well, people hear gunshots,

34:05.307 --> 34:06.901
everyone runs out screaming.

34:07.493 --> 34:09.614
And I run out with them in the chaos.

34:10.703 --> 34:11.975
On your knees.

34:12.652 --> 34:13.748
Fuck you.

34:13.978 --> 34:16.484
On your knees.

34:27.387 --> 34:28.795
I love you, man.

35:21.102 --> 35:22.392
Fuck...

35:37.826 --> 35:39.015
Kelly...

35:46.039 --> 35:47.502
I know you killed them.

35:47.996 --> 35:51.380
I'm starting to worry that this
obsession of yours isn't healthy, Grace.

35:51.755 --> 35:55.259
Those three American soldiers
did not die in a helicopter crash.

35:57.144 --> 35:58.690
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:58.810 --> 36:00.729
You think five grand a month

36:00.747 --> 36:03.043
makes up for what you did to those boys?

36:04.214 --> 36:07.716
- You don't know shit.
- I know they were on an off-book mission.

36:08.155 --> 36:09.966
No dog tags. No ID.

36:10.515 --> 36:12.427
I know you were in the Swat Valley.

36:12.930 --> 36:15.152
The same place those Special Ops soldiers

36:15.180 --> 36:18.162
delivered 10 million in cash
to a warlord named Massoud.

36:18.282 --> 36:19.513
I know that you robbed them.

36:19.514 --> 36:20.982
And I know that you executed them.

36:21.255 --> 36:22.790
And you think I'm capable of that?

36:23.851 --> 36:26.376
Yeah. Actually, I do.

36:27.628 --> 36:29.284
Well, you should arrest me then.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.622
I can get you a deal.

36:32.650 --> 36:35.320
If you cooperate, I'll keep
the needle out of your arm.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.015
It sounds like you don't have
anything to back up that story.

36:40.798 --> 36:42.417
Fine. You're not interested?

36:42.537 --> 36:45.756
'Cause I think Ray will be happy
to make a deal when we pick him up.

36:46.889 --> 36:48.453
I trust

36:48.892 --> 36:50.804
that he'll keep his mouth shut.

36:52.496 --> 36:54.636
Now, are we done?

37:13.120 --> 37:14.611
Sarah!

37:18.453 --> 37:20.017
Kelly, stop!

37:21.242 --> 37:22.505
Grace!

38:13.424 --> 38:15.226
Shit!

38:53.220 --> 38:54.601
Fuck...

39:01.469 --> 39:02.741
Sarah...

40:06.227 --> 40:08.175
Easy, motherfucker.

40:11.531 --> 40:12.830
You're American?

40:13.937 --> 40:15.857
We're Marines, you asshole!

40:15.857 --> 40:18.427
- Hey!
- Ethan, no!

40:23.619 --> 40:26.710
- What are you doing?
- Jesus Christ, Ethan!

40:27.369 --> 40:29.390
You fucking shoot 'em?

40:29.848 --> 40:32.207
What the fuck is wrong with you?

40:37.942 --> 40:39.826
What the fuck did I tell you?

40:39.946 --> 40:42.992
Get the goddamn money.
Let's go! Get the money!

41:13.356 --> 41:15.359
Haven't they locked you up yet?

41:17.728 --> 41:19.951
I hear congratulations are in order.

41:21.094 --> 41:23.134
Field Office Director, right?

41:24.204 --> 41:25.786
Was the title all it took?

41:25.906 --> 41:27.195
What do you want?

41:27.542 --> 41:30.021
Wanna know what they did?

41:30.926 --> 41:32.646
Ethan and his friends.

41:33.368 --> 41:34.630
Not really.

41:37.237 --> 41:39.570
If you want it to stay that way,
you keep me out of a courtroom.

41:39.817 --> 41:42.341
You're not in any position to make demands.

41:42.359 --> 41:44.564
It seems that's exactly
the position I'm in.

41:45.158 --> 41:47.637
Unless you want CNN to
hear about American soldiers

41:47.665 --> 41:49.128
sneaking into Pakistan.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.357
That's a diplomatic shitstorm.

41:53.582 --> 41:54.808
Do we have a deal?

41:56.655 --> 41:58.585
Where does Grace fall in all this?

42:00.780 --> 42:02.262
Do we have a deal?

42:17.014 --> 42:18.292
What are you doing?

42:19.182 --> 42:23.097
I am finishing up my report
on the Ray Williams murder.

42:24.258 --> 42:26.929
You're pissing off a
lot of people right now.

42:29.498 --> 42:31.684
The families of those
soldiers deserve the truth.

42:31.940 --> 42:35.699
The Feds are serious about
re-opening your shooting reviews.

42:35.727 --> 42:37.785
That's bad for you. And that's bad for me.

42:37.905 --> 42:39.760
So Ethan Kelly just gets away with it?

42:39.788 --> 42:42.651
Scream and shout all you
like, this is never coming out.

42:42.989 --> 42:46.254
Well, if anyone knows about
covering shit up, it would be you.

42:46.291 --> 42:47.598
Meaning?

42:48.723 --> 42:50.891
Meaning you can't shut me down on this.

42:52.180 --> 42:53.488
Can't I?

42:56.196 --> 42:58.537
I know Alec was in your pocket.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.886
And I know that Jimmy was too.

43:03.669 --> 43:06.897
And that's just a fraction
of what I have on you.

43:08.452 --> 43:10.172
Is that a threat?

43:23.415 --> 43:25.793
Things have been on a bit
of a downward slide for you,

43:25.820 --> 43:27.092
haven't they, Lieutenant?

43:31.051 --> 43:32.176
I want a lawyer.

43:32.296 --> 43:33.539
You won't need one.

43:34.408 --> 43:35.953
Not if you're smart.

43:36.073 --> 43:39.402
The CIA were giving
millions of taxpayer dollars

43:39.522 --> 43:41.112
to a Taliban gangster.

43:41.551 --> 43:43.677
That supposed to be some
sort of justification?

43:44.707 --> 43:47.681
Do you have any idea what we're
dealing with out there, Lieutenant?

43:48.356 --> 43:51.228
We were this close to getting
Massoud to the negotiating table.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.523
That would've saved lives.

43:53.643 --> 43:55.297
American lives.

43:55.736 --> 43:58.142
And it's all gone to shit
because of four small,

43:58.151 --> 44:00.246
short-sighted, greedy motherfuckers.

44:01.133 --> 44:03.664
Enough people have died
because of this money.

44:04.216 --> 44:05.935
Now, you keep your mouth shut.

44:08.442 --> 44:10.637
You're our greedy motherfucker now.

44:36.686 --> 44:38.734
- Hey.
- Hi.

44:55.180 --> 44:56.689
So what are we watching?

45:01.072 --> 45:02.307
Are you hungry?

45:03.386 --> 45:05.811
- Grandma should be home.
- She didn't tell you?

45:06.633 --> 45:08.791
She's gone. She went home to Marty.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.194
- What?
- Yeah.

45:15.899 --> 45:16.988
Yeah.

45:20.783 --> 45:21.999
Yeah.

45:29.416 --> 45:30.678
I'll get it.

45:31.181 --> 45:32.928
You wanna turn it down, sweetie?

45:40.225 --> 45:41.524
Can I help you?

46:03.777 --> 46:05.250
Mom?

46:07.042 --> 46:09.557
Mom, who's at the door?
