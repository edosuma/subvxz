WEBVTT

00:01.507 --> 00:02.776
I don't know anyone
that has ever made

00:02.777 --> 00:04.678
a long-distance
relationship work.

00:04.696 --> 00:06.656
But I can't stand
that I put you in this position,

00:06.681 --> 00:08.415
and the only way
I can see out of this

00:08.450 --> 00:11.035
is for you to go to Stanford.

00:11.069 --> 00:13.954
Come after me, Tanner.
That's what you're here for.

00:13.989 --> 00:15.239
You actually care about her.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.790
You think he didn't say
some things in there

00:16.825 --> 00:18.325
that got to me too?

00:18.359 --> 00:20.211
Well, I'm not bringing them up,
because right now,

00:20.245 --> 00:21.462
we need to stick together.

00:21.496 --> 00:23.363
Sticking together
means telling the truth.

00:23.381 --> 00:25.666
I can't stand
to see them come after you.

00:25.700 --> 00:26.884
You think I can't take it!

00:26.918 --> 00:28.252
Look, you're not listening
to me, okay?

00:28.303 --> 00:29.703
I can't take it!

00:29.721 --> 00:30.721
If all you want to do
is work with me,

00:30.755 --> 00:32.372
I can find a job
somewhere else.

00:32.390 --> 00:35.142
Scottie, that's not
all I want.

00:35.176 --> 00:36.176
Then say it.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.095
I want you in my life.

00:38.146 --> 00:39.513
I don't want her to go,

00:39.547 --> 00:41.381
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

00:41.399 --> 00:42.683
I finished my list.

00:42.717 --> 00:44.384
And?

00:44.402 --> 00:45.402
You're staying?

00:45.437 --> 00:48.939
Just try and stop me.

00:48.990 --> 00:53.077
This place has every
Harvard law student file ever.

00:53.111 --> 00:55.946
Do not touch
any of the files in here.

00:55.997 --> 00:58.666
Mike Ross--
he's not here.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.912 --> 01:12.079
What are you thinking about?

01:12.097 --> 01:14.431
You look beautiful.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.383
Thank you.

01:16.417 --> 01:17.918
What are you thinking?

01:17.936 --> 01:19.853
That your furniture's
really old.

01:19.888 --> 01:22.856
I think the word you're
looking for is "antiquey."

01:22.891 --> 01:26.393
That is not a word, and
this sofa is Ikea circa 1994.

01:26.427 --> 01:27.778
Okay, I get it.

01:27.812 --> 01:30.281
So you get up early just so you
can do a thorough critiquing

01:30.315 --> 01:31.615
of my furniture?

01:31.650 --> 01:35.486
Actually, I got up early,
so I could figure out

01:35.537 --> 01:39.039
if there's anything around here
that I could stand living with.

01:41.793 --> 01:44.111
Ah...I'm sorry--do you want
to move in together?

01:44.129 --> 01:45.829
Yeah, I mean,
if the offer still stands.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.333
Are you kidding me?

01:49.384 --> 01:50.801
So is that a yes?

01:50.835 --> 01:53.754
Oh, no, this is a yes.

01:58.459 --> 02:00.144
I figured out
what we can bring.

02:00.178 --> 02:01.512
- What?
- You.

02:01.563 --> 02:03.347
Panda, right here.

02:03.398 --> 02:05.099
That's my favorite piece of art.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.151
That is not art.

02:07.185 --> 02:08.969
Grammy gave that to me.

02:08.987 --> 02:10.104
Oh, I love it.
Panda can come.

02:10.138 --> 02:11.105
And the chair.

02:11.139 --> 02:12.740
Oh.

02:12.774 --> 02:13.741
That was
Grammy's favorite chair.

02:13.775 --> 02:14.975
I don't--I don't--

02:14.993 --> 02:16.643
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm telling you, Rachel,

02:16.661 --> 02:19.813
she used to sit in that chair
every Sunday

02:19.831 --> 02:22.649
and drink her hot cup
of Hershey's cocoa

02:22.667 --> 02:25.002
and tell me
all about growing up

02:25.036 --> 02:27.320
on the mean streets
of Philadelphia.

02:27.339 --> 02:30.157
When you lie,
try less details.

02:30.175 --> 02:31.158
Got it.

02:42.670 --> 02:44.638
Looking for me?

02:44.672 --> 02:47.174
No.

02:47.192 --> 02:50.177
The woman I'm looking for
is a lot more in my bed.

02:50.195 --> 02:53.313
What can I say?
My schedule stops for no man.

02:53.347 --> 02:57.534
Yes, but we've got
a little unfinished...

02:57.569 --> 03:00.120
Business.

03:00.155 --> 03:02.623
I wouldn't call last night
"unfinished."

03:02.657 --> 03:05.659
And I wouldn't call it
"business."

03:09.581 --> 03:12.532
I was talking about breakfast.

03:12.550 --> 03:14.501
Harvey Specter
makes breakfast?

03:14.535 --> 03:16.003
You never heard
of the Specter special?

03:16.037 --> 03:17.805
I think I just had
the Specter special.

03:17.839 --> 03:18.806
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.924
The Specter special is--
Let me guess.

03:20.975 --> 03:24.895
It's two eggs, over easy,

03:24.929 --> 03:28.148
with a side of "Scottie,
I want you in my life."

03:28.183 --> 03:29.566
Bacon.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.935
And now I'm reconsidering
the "in my life" thing.

03:31.986 --> 03:35.072
Oh, no, I saw your face.
You had your serious face on.

03:35.106 --> 03:37.491
"Scottie, I want you
in my life.

03:37.525 --> 03:40.611
Scottie...
I want you in my life."

03:40.662 --> 03:43.363
You know what?
You don't deserve my bacon.

03:43.397 --> 03:46.733
Oh, that's fine,
'cause I have to go anyway.

03:46.751 --> 03:48.202
Where could you have to go?
You're unemployed.

03:48.236 --> 03:51.071
Well, actually a top-tier
law firm offered me a job

03:51.089 --> 03:52.539
last night,
and I thought it might be best

03:52.573 --> 03:54.541
if I negotiate the terms
of my agreement

03:54.575 --> 03:57.511
with the partner
I'm not sleeping with.

03:57.545 --> 04:00.914
There's a slight problem
with that plan.

04:03.301 --> 04:05.385
You offered her a job
before talking to me?

04:05.419 --> 04:08.555
I didn't offer her a job.
I asked her if she wanted one.

04:08.589 --> 04:11.108
I didn't want to waste
your time, and for the record,

04:11.142 --> 04:12.182
we'd be lucky to have her.

04:12.193 --> 04:13.527
I know that.

04:13.561 --> 04:15.395
But my question isn't
why I should want her here,

04:15.429 --> 04:16.779
it's why you would want
her here.

04:16.815 --> 04:20.567
She's the best lawyer I know,
after me.

04:20.601 --> 04:21.767
And you.

04:21.786 --> 04:22.986
Are you sleeping with her?

04:23.037 --> 04:24.538
Excuse me?

04:24.572 --> 04:26.156
You have history
with this woman,

04:26.207 --> 04:27.541
so I just want to know

04:27.575 --> 04:29.376
are you doing this
because you feel sorry for her

04:29.410 --> 04:30.494
or because you want to pay
her back

04:30.545 --> 04:31.962
or because you love her
or what?

04:31.996 --> 04:33.964
- It's none of your business.
- It is my business.

04:33.998 --> 04:36.250
It is literally my business.

04:39.304 --> 04:41.805
I want a relationship
with her.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.973
Well, I'm happy for you.

04:43.007 --> 04:45.125
I hope you two make a run at it.
Thanks.

04:45.143 --> 04:46.626
I'll pretend you meant that.

04:46.644 --> 04:48.262
Your track record
isn't great.

04:48.296 --> 04:50.297
You've had three name partners
in two years.

04:50.315 --> 04:51.798
Let's talk
about your commitment issues.

04:51.816 --> 04:52.933
I'm not asking you

04:52.967 --> 04:55.402
to give my commitment issues
a corner office.

04:55.436 --> 04:56.937
You don't need to give her
a corner office.

04:56.971 --> 04:58.238
Any regular office will do.

04:58.273 --> 05:00.440
Harvey, I get it.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.476
She's a catch, for you
and for this firm.

05:03.495 --> 05:05.015
But what happens
when you two break up?

05:05.029 --> 05:07.281
Who says
we're gonna break up?

05:46.398 --> 05:48.233
Foreman versus Heart Med--
I want it.

05:48.251 --> 05:49.501
"Good morning, Harvey.

05:49.535 --> 05:50.619
What can I do for you today?"
I'm serious.

05:50.670 --> 05:51.787
They're pushing for a settlement

05:51.838 --> 05:52.788
because they know our client
can afford it.

05:52.839 --> 05:54.873
I know they are.

05:54.907 --> 05:56.091
You haven't even looked
at the file.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.408
My name is on the door.

05:57.427 --> 05:58.710
You think I don't know
our cases?

05:58.744 --> 06:00.245
So why are we settling?

06:00.263 --> 06:01.463
Because regardless
of the merits of this case,

06:01.514 --> 06:02.681
it's not worth our time.

06:02.715 --> 06:04.216
Harvey, listen--

06:04.250 --> 06:06.084
Heart Med's in-house lawyer
negotiated this

06:06.102 --> 06:09.187
because the bad PR costs them
more than the settlement.

06:09.222 --> 06:10.439
We'd have to get the thing
dismissed to make it worth it,

06:10.473 --> 06:11.556
and that's not gonna happen.

06:11.590 --> 06:14.025
The lawyer is Nick Rinaldi.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.140
- Who the hell is Nick Rinaldi?
- You don't remember?

06:16.145 --> 06:18.947
I was 11 years old,
a little boy, powerless.

06:18.981 --> 06:20.699
I watched him boil my parents'
lives down to a few dollars.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.484
Yes.

06:22.535 --> 06:23.869
I'm not gonna let that piece
of shit get a penny from us.

06:23.903 --> 06:27.605
I said yes.

06:27.623 --> 06:29.074
Thanks, Harvey.

06:29.108 --> 06:30.742
You want to thank me,

06:30.776 --> 06:34.379
why don't you go beat
the shit out of this guy?

06:36.299 --> 06:38.834
Monday, 2:20 p.m.

06:40.619 --> 06:42.954
This conundrum is burning a hole
in my brain.

06:42.972 --> 06:45.257
Think.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.457
Logically.

06:46.476 --> 06:50.428
I mean, Sheila is professional
and meticulous

06:50.462 --> 06:52.981
and wonderfully anal,

06:53.015 --> 06:54.766
and if she says that nothing
gets misplaced

06:54.800 --> 06:56.985
in her inner sanctum,
then I believe her,

06:57.019 --> 07:00.071
which leaves
the national security option.

07:02.108 --> 07:04.276
Is Mike Ross CIA?

07:04.310 --> 07:05.944
Please.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.696
There's a better chance
that Esther's in the KGB.

07:07.747 --> 07:09.114
I mean, I can ask Sheila,

07:09.148 --> 07:12.000
if I'm no longer fond
of my testicles, which--

07:12.034 --> 07:15.003
wait a second,
missing testicles, missing file.

07:15.037 --> 07:18.990
It can't be missing
if it doesn't exist.

07:19.008 --> 07:22.660
Holy shit.

07:22.678 --> 07:25.597
What if Mike Ross never went
to Harvard at all?

07:25.631 --> 07:29.134
What if he just went to some
crappy third-tier law school,

07:29.168 --> 07:32.687
like Fordham or Arizona State?

07:32.722 --> 07:34.439
"Yeah, hey, bro.

07:34.473 --> 07:36.191
"Yeah, no, I'll see you
at the party.

07:36.225 --> 07:37.642
"I'm not going to study
for the bar.

07:37.676 --> 07:39.644
"Damn straight, that's right,
bros before hos.

07:39.678 --> 07:41.346
Oh, yeah, you know--"
all right, that's enough.

07:41.364 --> 07:47.285
He's been peeing directly into
our pristine pool of eliteness.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.905
He's been--oh, shoot,
it's blinking out.

07:49.956 --> 07:51.072
Norma, really quickly,

07:51.123 --> 07:52.824
I need you to get a pack
of rechargeable AAA--

07:52.858 --> 07:53.992
shit, it's out.

07:54.026 --> 07:57.362
So I guess I'm just talking
to myself.

07:57.380 --> 08:00.999
Harvey convinced me,
so let's get to it.

08:01.033 --> 08:03.802
- I want a relocation fee.
- Done.

08:03.836 --> 08:05.170
And a 10% increase
on my signing bonus.

08:05.204 --> 08:06.838
7%.

08:06.872 --> 08:08.139
You gave Harvey 10%.

08:08.174 --> 08:10.725
Do you think you're worth
as much as Harvey?

08:10.760 --> 08:11.876
I'm less of a pain
in the ass.

08:11.894 --> 08:14.512
10% it is.

08:14.546 --> 08:16.147
Now, no one ever opens
with the big stuff,

08:16.182 --> 08:18.149
so why don't you tell me
what you're really after?

08:18.184 --> 08:20.018
You know what I'm after.

08:20.052 --> 08:22.654
The name of the firm
is Pearson Specter.

08:22.688 --> 08:24.906
It's changed too many times, and
it's not going to change again.

08:24.941 --> 08:27.692
Never?

08:27.726 --> 08:29.194
I never say never.

08:29.228 --> 08:31.830
- That's all I'm looking for.
- Of course.

08:31.864 --> 08:35.366
After all, who knows where any
of us will be in a few years?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.235
You, me, Harvey.

08:37.253 --> 08:39.236
I think we just changed
the subject.

08:39.255 --> 08:41.456
We did.

08:41.506 --> 08:45.176
Now it's time for me to tell you
what I'm really after.

08:45.211 --> 08:47.796
You want to know how committed
I am to Harvey.

08:47.847 --> 08:51.683
I want to know how committed
you are to me.

08:51.717 --> 08:53.918
- How serious are you?
- About what?

08:53.936 --> 08:56.021
Me.

08:56.055 --> 08:57.389
We had this conversation.

08:57.423 --> 08:58.723
We had this conversation

08:58.757 --> 09:00.475
before it was going to cost me
$500,000.

09:00.526 --> 09:04.229
Jessica's making you pay
the buy-in up front?

09:04.263 --> 09:05.730
- Yep.
- Sh--.

09:05.764 --> 09:07.198
What did you say?

09:07.233 --> 09:08.283
Well, I said I don't want
to have to pay

09:08.317 --> 09:10.318
a Harvey-Specter-girlfriend tax.

09:10.369 --> 09:11.453
You're not exactly paying
a tax.

09:11.487 --> 09:12.904
You're just buying in early.

09:12.938 --> 09:14.873
Harvey, there's a reason
that firms are designed to have

09:14.907 --> 09:16.074
a six-month trial period.

09:16.108 --> 09:17.628
Yeah, to see
if it's going to work out.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.294
- Exactly.
- Which you don't think it will.

09:19.328 --> 09:20.611
I'm saying
that I need to know

09:20.630 --> 09:23.081
what "I want you in my life"
really means.

09:23.115 --> 09:25.283
You know what it means.

09:25.301 --> 09:27.785
It means I want to have
a relationship.

09:27.803 --> 09:31.256
But it doesn't mean that
I'm ready to give you a ring.

09:31.290 --> 09:32.807
You think I'm ready
for a ring from you?

09:32.842 --> 09:34.292
Then what are you ready for?

09:34.310 --> 09:36.794
I'm ready for it not
to cost me a $1/2 million

09:36.812 --> 09:38.396
if it doesn't work out.

09:38.431 --> 09:40.148
So if it doesn't, are you
saying you're going to leave?

09:40.182 --> 09:41.599
Would you want me to stay?

09:41.633 --> 09:44.802
I don't even know what
you're gonna do to break us up.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.905
Harvey, I'm not kidding.
I'm...

09:48.491 --> 09:51.026
I'm scared.

09:51.077 --> 09:52.327
You know, I just got an offer

09:52.361 --> 09:54.079
from Latham & Watkins
in Chicago,

09:54.113 --> 09:58.616
and I don't want to take it,
but...

09:58.650 --> 10:00.452
I need to know that
you're serious about this.

10:00.486 --> 10:03.788
Scottie, I am.

10:03.822 --> 10:07.325
Yeah, but nobody's asking you
to put up $1/2 million.

10:07.343 --> 10:09.427
Maybe we can make it

10:09.462 --> 10:12.714
so nobody's asking you
to do that either.

10:17.169 --> 10:18.470
Rinaldi.

10:21.857 --> 10:24.442
You remember me?

10:24.477 --> 10:25.777
James and Nina Ross.

10:25.811 --> 10:27.896
That's good.

10:27.947 --> 10:31.282
Finally know
my parents' names.

10:31.317 --> 10:32.867
What you maybe don't know
is that I'm a lawyer,

10:32.902 --> 10:34.319
I work for Pearson Specter,

10:34.353 --> 10:37.355
and we're not going to be
settling this Foreman suit.

10:37.373 --> 10:38.356
We had an agreement.

10:38.374 --> 10:40.959
Yeah, maybe, but instead,

10:40.993 --> 10:44.212
we're gonna be filing this.

10:44.246 --> 10:47.916
There's no way you're getting
this case dismissed.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.801
You know, I actually wanted
to believe that whole sob story

10:49.835 --> 10:51.219
about being reformed, but--

10:51.253 --> 10:54.222
My client is a widow,
not a drunk driver.

10:54.256 --> 10:55.706
Oh, so you don't actually
bully the little guy anymore,

10:55.725 --> 10:56.891
you just try
and capitalize on him.

10:56.926 --> 10:58.393
Do you even know the details
of this case,

10:58.427 --> 10:59.844
or are you just coming after us
because I'm on the other side?

10:59.878 --> 11:01.212
No, I'm coming after you

11:01.230 --> 11:03.047
because you're
a worthless ambulance chaser,

11:03.065 --> 11:05.066
and I'm not gonna let you take
my client's money.

11:05.101 --> 11:06.551
This is the second time
you've come after me

11:06.569 --> 11:07.569
from out of the blue.

11:07.603 --> 11:08.686
I apologized to you once.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.388
I will not apologize
to you again.

11:10.406 --> 11:12.490
You don't have to.

11:12.525 --> 11:13.775
And we're not going to court,

11:13.826 --> 11:16.911
because I'm gonna prove
you're full of shit.

11:18.812 --> 11:19.845
You ready
for the deposition?

11:19.863 --> 11:21.313
Yeah, of course I'm ready.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.898
- Your fly is unzipped.
- No, it's not.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.233
Didn't even flinch.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.284
That means you're ready.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.635
Then why are you still walking
with me?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.070
'Cause I'm coming
to your deposition.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.405
What?
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.706
You said that I could take
this case.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.408
You told me I could kick
this guy's ass.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.876
It's my deposition, not yours.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.544
- I know.
- You know?

11:35.578 --> 11:37.746
Why are you babysitting me?
I'm not babysitting you.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.947
I want to watch you
kill this guy.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.249
That's why I brought snacks.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.963
You can't bring peanuts
into my deposition.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.585
- Why?
- It's unprofessional.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.220
So is that tie,
but I've made my peace with it.

11:45.255 --> 11:46.388
Look, I don't give a shit

11:46.423 --> 11:47.756
whether you made your peace
with it or not.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.974
You want in my room?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.559
You're not bringing peanuts.

11:50.593 --> 11:53.479
You really are ready.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.630
Here.

11:58.268 --> 11:59.768
What's this?

11:59.802 --> 12:02.154
Harvey's interviews
the day Mike Ross was hired.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.574
But Mike Ross isn't on it.

12:05.608 --> 12:06.942
Where'd you get this?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.810
Doesn't matter where I got it.
The fact is I did.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.746
Are you asking me
why Mike Ross isn't on it?

12:10.780 --> 12:13.282
Yeah, Donna, that's
precisely what I'm asking.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.817
How exactly did Harvey
find him?

12:15.835 --> 12:18.203
We didn't find him,
he found us.

12:18.254 --> 12:19.421
What are you talking about?

12:22.959 --> 12:24.793
Mike hadn't signed up
for the interview on time,

12:24.827 --> 12:25.961
so he pretended to be

12:25.995 --> 12:28.047
one of the other associates
on the list.

12:28.098 --> 12:29.598
He talked his way past me

12:29.632 --> 12:30.999
and impressed the shit
out of Harvey,

12:31.017 --> 12:32.518
whose main requirement was
somebody who had the balls

12:32.552 --> 12:34.269
to do something like that
in the first place.

12:34.304 --> 12:36.305
Okay.

12:38.641 --> 12:39.608
What if he had the balls
to do something

12:39.642 --> 12:41.527
a lot bigger than that?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.278
What are you talking about?

12:43.313 --> 12:44.679
I think Mike Ross went
to a subpar law school

12:44.698 --> 12:46.181
and has been lying about it
the whole time.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.901
Louis, listen to yourself.
You're talking about Mike.

12:48.952 --> 12:50.119
You're insane.

12:50.153 --> 12:52.788
I'm...

12:52.822 --> 12:55.374
Okay, I was in the Harvard
file room with Sheila.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.159
Don't ask details.

12:57.193 --> 13:01.046
And I noticed Mike Ross' file
was not there.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.199
You specifically looked
for his file?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.417
Yes, and I looked
for Harvey's too,

13:05.468 --> 13:06.668
and his was there.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.337
And by the way,
he looked like a major douche.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.339
So you looked at a grand total
of two files

13:10.373 --> 13:11.673
out of tens of thousands,

13:11.707 --> 13:14.560
and this is the conclusion
you jump to?

13:14.594 --> 13:15.644
What is wrong with you?

13:15.678 --> 13:17.146
You don't know Sheila.

13:17.180 --> 13:18.897
She's like a surgeon,
and the files are her patients.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.015
She doesn't make mistakes.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.735
- You told her about this?
- Hell no.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.737
She told me not to touch
any of those files,

13:24.771 --> 13:26.105
and she'd kill me
if she found out that I did.

13:26.156 --> 13:27.573
I just asked her
about it generally.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.325
Well, of course she's
gonna say she never loses one,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.027
but I can tell you
from personal experience,

13:32.061 --> 13:35.397
anything can happen to a file.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.782
I don't know.

13:36.833 --> 13:40.119
Well, I do. I know Mike,
and I know he's for real.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.287
But if you still doubt it,
there's an easy answer.

13:42.338 --> 13:45.240
Just call up Harvard and ask
for a copy of his transcript.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.293
And what if it's not there?

13:48.344 --> 13:51.430
Then I will apologize
for calling you insane

13:51.464 --> 13:54.933
and personally help you escort
Mike Ross out of the building.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.857
Good-bye.

14:01.891 --> 14:04.193
In 2002, you were sued
for the malfunctioning

14:04.227 --> 14:05.778
of an earlier model
of the heart stent.

14:05.812 --> 14:06.895
Is that correct?

14:06.929 --> 14:08.763
Yes, and we admitted
wrongdoing.

14:08.782 --> 14:11.617
The stent that was installed
in your patient was a new model

14:11.651 --> 14:15.204
developed through three years
of extensive trials.

14:15.238 --> 14:17.406
Making it outside the scope,
and frankly, not a good argument

14:17.440 --> 14:18.740
for establishing pattern.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.942
They saw a problem,
and they fixed it.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.611
How horrible,
we should sue them.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.912
We're not in court.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.464
Opening statements
are made before a judge,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.049
or have you never been
in court before?

14:27.083 --> 14:28.404
I just wanted to give you
a taste,

14:28.418 --> 14:31.086
seeing as we're never
actually gonna get there.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.339
A dismissal is
never gonna happen, son.

14:37.811 --> 14:40.262
Sorry for your loss, son.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.430
What?

14:41.464 --> 14:45.300
I'm saying, don't hope
for a dismissal.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.568
Please direct your questions
to our client.

14:46.603 --> 14:48.303
That wasn't a question.
It was a comment.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.572
Here's a question for you,
Mr. Dimond.

14:50.607 --> 14:52.107
What is this really worth
to you?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.909
You may think you have
a defense.

14:53.943 --> 14:56.278
Your lawyer certainly thinks
you do.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.113
But I just want to be clear
about the facts.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.949
What is this really worth
to you?

15:00.983 --> 15:03.669
There's no question,
this was a terrible accident.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.254
But let's be clear
about the facts.

15:05.288 --> 15:10.926
His blood alcohol level
is an issue here.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.294
If you pursue this in court,

15:12.328 --> 15:13.962
there's no guarantee
you'll receive anything.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.098
Think about the boy.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.100
Think about what he needs.

15:19.636 --> 15:21.002
Something is better
than nothing.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.563
Stop stalling, Mr. Ross.

15:36.119 --> 15:37.986
- Um, I--
- He's not stalling.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.988
And we're under no obligation

15:40.022 --> 15:42.157
to disclose trials
from an earlier model.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.792
It's beyond the scope.

15:43.826 --> 15:45.410
Our expert will place
that study within the scope.

15:45.461 --> 15:46.411
Um, uh--

15:46.462 --> 15:47.862
If there isn't a trial,

15:47.881 --> 15:49.531
your expert won't have
any scope to place it in.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.583
And since you insist
on asking questions

15:51.634 --> 15:53.385
we're under no obligation
to answer,

15:53.419 --> 15:55.921
this deposition is over.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.677
What the hell happened
in there?

16:01.711 --> 16:03.545
You said you wanted to watch,
not hijack my case.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.314
You said
you were going to kick his ass,

16:05.348 --> 16:06.481
not drift
into never-never land.

16:06.516 --> 16:08.400
- I'm handling it.
- Handling it?

16:08.434 --> 16:09.768
I could've eaten
that whole bag of peanuts

16:09.819 --> 16:12.053
in the pause you took
to answer that question.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.189
You got thrown,
and I bailed you out.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.657
Harvey, this is my case.

16:15.692 --> 16:18.026
This is not your case.
It's the client's case.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.394
And after what happened
in there,

16:19.412 --> 16:21.246
they're in a worse position
than when we started.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.398
Look, I know I got thrown,
but I can still recover.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.400
Maybe, but they're gonna call
in a half an hour

16:25.418 --> 16:26.702
wanting to take the deal,

16:26.736 --> 16:29.237
and when they do,
I'm gonna buy you one day,

16:29.255 --> 16:32.257
and then
I'm pulling the plug.

16:36.616 --> 16:38.109
Hey, do you have a minute?

16:38.110 --> 16:40.194
- I'm a little busy right now.
- We have a problem.

16:40.228 --> 16:42.396
Scottie's not going to be
a problem.

16:42.414 --> 16:45.700
I thought it through--
Louis might be onto Mike.

16:48.921 --> 16:50.421
He found out that Mike
doesn't have a file

16:50.456 --> 16:51.839
in the Harvard file room

16:51.874 --> 16:54.208
and that he wasn't
on your original interview list.

16:54.242 --> 16:55.343
What did you tell him?

16:55.377 --> 16:56.711
Well, I handled the list.

16:56.745 --> 16:58.930
- What about the other?
- What could I tell him?

16:58.964 --> 17:00.414
I mean, I told him
if he was so curious,

17:00.432 --> 17:02.350
he could order a copy
of Mike's transcript.

17:02.384 --> 17:04.084
Then we don't have
a problem.

17:04.103 --> 17:06.938
Well, don't you think maybe
we should do something else?

17:06.972 --> 17:09.256
Anything else is just going
to make him more suspicious.

17:09.273 --> 17:11.559
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:11.593 --> 17:13.027
Okay.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.028
Oh, wait a second.

17:14.061 --> 17:15.429
Where did you say
Louis was again?

17:15.446 --> 17:16.948
Oh, he was
in the Harvard file room.

17:16.982 --> 17:18.116
How was he
in the Harvard file room?

17:18.150 --> 17:20.434
He has a relationship
with Sheila Sazs.

17:20.452 --> 17:21.702
What?

17:21.737 --> 17:24.739
Yeah, never mind.
We're good.

17:37.118 --> 17:38.619
Oh, thank you,

17:38.637 --> 17:40.671
but I'm sorry,
I don't have time.

17:40.722 --> 17:42.673
It's food.
It's not going to stop you.

17:42.724 --> 17:43.724
It's going to keep you going.

17:43.759 --> 17:45.143
Yeah, I don't need food.

17:45.177 --> 17:46.227
I need to find something
I can take

17:46.261 --> 17:48.763
to this dismissal hearing
tomorrow.

17:48.797 --> 17:50.898
Mike, it was
a pretty decent settlement.

17:50.933 --> 17:53.133
Would it really be so bad
to just take it?

17:56.155 --> 17:58.356
My dad was one of those guys

17:58.407 --> 18:00.691
who liked to celebrate
everything--

18:00.742 --> 18:04.362
the half birthdays
or first time

18:04.413 --> 18:06.831
I struck someone out
at Little League.

18:06.865 --> 18:09.200
And the last time I saw them,
they were celebrating

18:09.251 --> 18:13.287
the anniversary
of their first date.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.291
They were so excited,
all dressed up,

18:17.325 --> 18:20.428
and I was annoyed,

18:20.462 --> 18:21.679
because I didn't want
to spend the night

18:21.713 --> 18:24.498
at my grandmother's house.

18:24.516 --> 18:26.467
So before they left,

18:26.501 --> 18:28.335
my dad came upstairs
to say good-bye,

18:28.353 --> 18:32.056
and I told him that celebrating
a first date was stupid.

18:33.942 --> 18:35.509
And he just looks at me like,

18:35.527 --> 18:37.028
"Michael, you have no idea

18:37.062 --> 18:40.531
how important
a first date can be."

18:40.566 --> 18:43.150
Theirs must have been
a great one.

18:43.184 --> 18:45.820
No, no, no,
it was a total disaster.

18:45.854 --> 18:48.823
He spilled wine all over her.
He forgot his wallet.

18:50.859 --> 18:52.693
And then, for some reason,
this woman, you know--

18:52.711 --> 18:57.715
this woman who he knew
was just perfect--

18:57.749 --> 18:59.750
agreed to a second date.

18:59.801 --> 19:02.753
And a third.

19:02.804 --> 19:06.641
And everything after that.

19:06.675 --> 19:09.560
I wish
I could have met them.

19:09.595 --> 19:12.597
He tried
to hug me good-bye...

19:15.234 --> 19:17.268
But I didn't hug him back.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.575
I didn't even go downstairs
to say good-bye to my mom.

19:35.087 --> 19:37.288
And then they were gone.

19:40.008 --> 19:42.076
And then the next morning,
Rinaldi shows up at our house,

19:42.094 --> 19:44.795
and he offers my grandmother

19:44.846 --> 19:49.083
the equivalent
of one year's rent.

19:49.101 --> 19:50.434
Rinaldi didn't kill
my parents,

19:50.469 --> 19:54.588
but he did try to tell me
what their lives were worth.

19:54.606 --> 19:59.393
And I'm sorry, but I know that
my mom and dad were worth...

19:59.427 --> 20:00.728
A lot more than that.

20:00.762 --> 20:04.431
Forget the food.

20:04.449 --> 20:07.735
Give me half the files.

20:21.249 --> 20:23.801
What about a hedge fund guy?
It's big money.

20:23.835 --> 20:24.835
Think bigger.

20:24.886 --> 20:26.286
Obama.

20:26.305 --> 20:27.338
I'm not going to land
the president

20:27.389 --> 20:29.423
as my first client.

20:29.457 --> 20:30.925
Fine, if you don't think
you can.

20:30.959 --> 20:33.561
You're not going to manipulate
me into trying to land Obama.

20:33.595 --> 20:35.479
Well, it better be somebody
like that,

20:35.514 --> 20:38.799
or Jessica won't give up
on her early buy-in bullshit.

20:38.817 --> 20:40.818
What if I got myself
a sports guy?

20:40.852 --> 20:44.405
The very fact that you call it
"a sports guy" means it's a no.

20:44.439 --> 20:46.157
Harvey, just because
I don't know sports

20:46.191 --> 20:48.475
doesn't mean I don't know you.

20:48.493 --> 20:49.643
What are you talking about?

20:49.661 --> 20:51.245
If I'm going to change
Jessica's mind,

20:51.279 --> 20:52.363
I can't just land someone,

20:52.414 --> 20:54.415
I have to land someone
you couldn't.

20:54.449 --> 20:56.483
There's no one
I couldn't land.

20:56.501 --> 20:59.253
You think I don't know
about Beijing?

21:01.456 --> 21:04.125
That's his word
against mine.

21:04.159 --> 21:07.595
Oh, well, um, I guess
we can clear that up right now,

21:07.629 --> 21:11.265
because look
who just walked in.

21:14.169 --> 21:16.437
You knew
he was coming here tonight?

21:16.471 --> 21:18.022
You think
I like Argentinean food?

21:18.056 --> 21:19.724
I just need you to stop him
for a second.

21:19.775 --> 21:21.108
I get it.

21:21.143 --> 21:23.694
You got the idea
from <i>Working Girl,</i>

21:23.729 --> 21:26.346
when they crash the wedding
to get to Trask radio.

21:26.365 --> 21:27.732
Harvey, I'm not
a 14-year-old girl.

21:27.783 --> 21:30.951
I don't get my ideas
from movies.

21:30.986 --> 21:33.687
Michael.

21:33.705 --> 21:34.989
Harvey.

21:35.023 --> 21:37.357
I have no interest
in talking to you.

21:37.376 --> 21:39.994
Hi. Dana Scott.

21:40.028 --> 21:41.629
I work with Harvey,
and I don't blame you.

21:41.663 --> 21:43.363
I wouldn't want him
to represent me either.

21:43.382 --> 21:44.415
But he's not
the only lawyer there.

21:44.466 --> 21:45.750
Let me guess.

21:45.801 --> 21:47.168
You've done your research
on my record,

21:47.202 --> 21:49.036
and you're here to impress me.

21:49.054 --> 21:50.554
That's what
every other lawyer would do.

21:50.589 --> 21:52.390
- I didn't do that.
- Harvey, shut up.

21:52.424 --> 21:55.092
I don't give a shit
about how fast you used to swim.

21:55.143 --> 21:57.144
I only care about how fast
I can make you money.

21:57.179 --> 21:59.146
How fast is that?

21:59.181 --> 22:01.098
Why don't you sit down,
and I'll tell you?

22:01.149 --> 22:03.484
- All right.
- Okay.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.188
Harvey, you mind?

22:07.222 --> 22:09.073
- Actually, I--
- Great.

22:09.107 --> 22:11.575
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:11.610 --> 22:14.912
Good to see you, buddy.

22:14.946 --> 22:16.330
So what really happened
in Beijing?

22:16.364 --> 22:18.232
Let's get a drink first.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.201
Sounds good.

22:20.235 --> 22:22.119
Doctor, how routine
is this procedure?

22:22.170 --> 22:23.570
Sid Foreman
should have been dancing

22:23.588 --> 22:25.840
at his daughter's wedding
a week later.

22:25.874 --> 22:29.176
Instead, he went
into heart failure.

22:29.211 --> 22:32.430
Dr. Lombard,
on December 7, 2006,

22:32.464 --> 22:35.716
did a patient die on your table
during a routine angioplasty?

22:35.750 --> 22:37.718
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

22:37.752 --> 22:38.919
It speaks
to his qualifications

22:38.937 --> 22:40.054
as an expert witness,
Your Honor.

22:40.088 --> 22:42.589
I'll allow.

22:42.607 --> 22:44.391
Yes, a patient died.

22:44.425 --> 22:45.893
And was a malpractice suit

22:45.927 --> 22:47.361
filed against you
for physician error?

22:47.395 --> 22:48.529
That case was sealed.

22:48.563 --> 22:49.780
I didn't ask you
if it was sealed.

22:49.815 --> 22:51.866
I asked if it was filed.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.033
It was.

22:53.068 --> 22:54.985
- And settled?
- For almost nothing--

22:55.036 --> 22:55.986
Objection, Your Honor.

22:56.037 --> 22:57.238
Move to strike.
The case is sealed.

22:57.272 --> 22:58.672
The witness
isn't allowed to testify

22:58.707 --> 22:59.790
to the details
of that settlement.

22:59.825 --> 23:00.908
Sustained.

23:00.942 --> 23:02.910
Have you practiced medicine
since?

23:02.944 --> 23:05.246
Yes, I've been practicing.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.631
I'm sorry, what I meant to say
is have you performed surgery,

23:07.666 --> 23:09.834
the job you spent seven years
training to do?

23:09.885 --> 23:11.886
No.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.254
What, loss of confidence?

23:13.288 --> 23:14.555
They wouldn't let you?

23:14.589 --> 23:15.622
Objection.
Speculation.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.457
I want an answer
to my question.

23:17.476 --> 23:18.926
I chose to do other things.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.177
Other things
that don't involve the chance

23:20.228 --> 23:21.228
of you killing people?

23:21.263 --> 23:22.629
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

23:22.647 --> 23:24.131
What's your primary source
of income?

23:24.149 --> 23:26.484
I work as an expert witness.

23:26.518 --> 23:27.818
So you testify now
to make a living,

23:27.853 --> 23:29.904
because you don't trust yourself
to do the job

23:29.938 --> 23:31.188
that you were trained to do?

23:31.239 --> 23:33.473
I can speak to the facts
of this case--

23:33.492 --> 23:34.742
Yes, you can speak to them,

23:34.776 --> 23:35.910
but how are we supposed to trust
your opinion about them

23:35.944 --> 23:39.914
when you clearly
don't trust yourself?

23:45.253 --> 23:46.773
You raised some doubts
about my expert.

23:46.788 --> 23:48.706
That isn't gonna get
this case dismissed.

23:48.757 --> 23:50.341
Maybe not,
but if that's the best expert

23:50.375 --> 23:51.855
you can come up with,
then your client

23:51.877 --> 23:53.660
just got a taste
of how this trial is gonna go.

23:53.678 --> 23:56.297
My client
is not gonna drop this case,

23:56.331 --> 23:59.967
and neither am I.

24:00.001 --> 24:03.270
Well, then you are forcing me
to use this.

24:03.305 --> 24:05.672
It's a picture of Mr. Foreman
at his daughter's wedding.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.024
It's a picture of Mr. Foreman
drinking alcohol

24:07.058 --> 24:08.609
at his daughter's wedding.

24:08.643 --> 24:10.978
It's a toast.
It was one sip.

24:11.012 --> 24:13.680
One sip two hours before his
stent supposedly malfunctioned.

24:13.698 --> 24:16.066
Alcohol was strictly forbidden
following his surgery,

24:16.117 --> 24:18.786
which makes him liable
for his own death.

24:18.820 --> 24:20.187
This is a total twisting
of the facts.

24:20.205 --> 24:21.789
You can't prove
this caused anything.

24:21.823 --> 24:23.223
You can't prove
it was only one sip,

24:23.241 --> 24:24.959
and it doesn't matter,
because I submit this,

24:24.993 --> 24:28.712
it's contributory negligence,
and your case is gone.

24:28.747 --> 24:31.832
And you say I'm a monster.

24:31.866 --> 24:33.334
Being a monster would be
putting your client

24:33.368 --> 24:35.169
on the stand
and making her testify

24:35.203 --> 24:37.471
that her husband's death
was his own damn fault.

24:41.376 --> 24:42.409
Hi, Donna.

24:42.427 --> 24:44.595
Hi, Louis.

24:44.629 --> 24:46.847
I'm nothing
if not a big man,

24:46.881 --> 24:49.750
and I am not ashamed
to admit when I am wrong.

24:49.768 --> 24:51.769
You got Mike's transcript.

24:51.803 --> 24:54.188
Arrived this morning.

24:54.222 --> 24:55.889
Imagine that,
Mike Ross went to Harvard.

24:55.923 --> 24:57.924
What a shocker.
You were right.

24:57.942 --> 25:00.027
Never should have doubted it.

25:00.061 --> 25:02.396
You know, it's just hard
to imagine a world

25:02.430 --> 25:03.864
in which Sheila made
a mistake, though.

25:03.898 --> 25:05.532
Well, it's just good
you can put this to bed

25:05.567 --> 25:06.567
once and for all.

25:06.601 --> 25:08.569
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

25:08.603 --> 25:10.270
If Sheila's competence
is that important to her,

25:10.288 --> 25:14.792
I need to tell her about this,
so she can fix it.

25:14.826 --> 25:15.942
You know what, Louis?

25:15.960 --> 25:17.911
It occurred to me
after we talked

25:17.945 --> 25:20.297
that I'm the only one who has
the list of associates

25:20.331 --> 25:22.132
that interviewed
with Harvey that day.

25:22.167 --> 25:24.585
That can't be right,

25:24.619 --> 25:26.920
'cause I got a copy
off the general server.

25:26.954 --> 25:28.138
You got a copy
by bullying Benjamin

25:28.173 --> 25:30.457
into accessing my private files
off my hard drive.

25:30.475 --> 25:32.459
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Louis--

25:32.477 --> 25:33.977
Okay, I did it, but that was
only 'cause I was concerned.

25:34.012 --> 25:37.097
So your concern gives you
the right to invade my privacy?

25:37.131 --> 25:39.566
I--what?
No, it was just a file.

25:39.601 --> 25:41.468
How dare you?

25:41.486 --> 25:43.404
You pretend to be
this gallant man.

25:43.438 --> 25:45.806
You make a big show of how you
would never cross into my area

25:45.824 --> 25:46.940
without my permission.

25:46.974 --> 25:48.659
I am gallant,
and I would never dare.

25:48.693 --> 25:50.744
You wouldn't dare, because
you'd have to do it to my face.

25:50.779 --> 25:53.030
But you have no problem breaking
my trust behind my back,

25:53.081 --> 25:55.148
and that not only pisses me off,

25:55.166 --> 25:57.868
but it makes me question...

25:57.919 --> 26:00.320
Whether I want to have
a relationship with you at all.

26:00.338 --> 26:03.156
I'm so sorry, Donna.

26:03.174 --> 26:04.675
No, Louis, you know what--

26:04.709 --> 26:07.928
- No, no, no, Donna, I'm sorry.
- No, I can't.

26:07.962 --> 26:09.263
- No, no, no, no.
- I can't--I can't even--

26:09.297 --> 26:11.331
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, shh! Don't speak.

26:11.349 --> 26:14.501
I cannot even look at you
right now.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.002
And I don't even know
why I'm gonna tell you this,

26:16.020 --> 26:17.554
but if you pissed me off
that much,

26:17.605 --> 26:18.806
what do you think
Sheila's gonna do

26:18.840 --> 26:21.675
when you tell her
you violated her trust?

26:21.693 --> 26:24.478
Huh?

26:24.512 --> 26:26.864
You're right.

26:26.898 --> 26:28.348
Thank you, Donna,

26:28.366 --> 26:31.902
for putting your anger on hold
long enough to help me salvage

26:31.953 --> 26:34.288
the single most important
non-feline relationship

26:34.322 --> 26:37.157
of my life.

26:50.388 --> 26:52.806
- Someone's been a bad boy.
- Sheila.

26:52.841 --> 26:53.807
You thought
I wouldn't find out?

26:53.842 --> 26:55.876
I hoped you wouldn't.

26:59.547 --> 27:02.048
If you wanted a pair
of my underwear,

27:02.066 --> 27:04.318
you should have just asked.

27:04.352 --> 27:05.719
Oh, that, Sheila.

27:05.737 --> 27:07.721
God, what are you doing here?

27:07.739 --> 27:09.773
Aren't you happy I'm here?

27:09.824 --> 27:12.159
Of course, absolutely.

27:12.193 --> 27:14.611
- You don't seem happy.
- I'm overjoyed.

27:14.662 --> 27:16.363
I'm just, you know--
I'm just surprised.

27:16.397 --> 27:18.665
But you're all nervous
and sweaty.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.534
Come on, you know
my sweat ducts get excited

27:20.568 --> 27:22.068
when they see you.
Good.

27:22.086 --> 27:24.237
Because your sweat ducts are
going to be working overtime.

27:24.255 --> 27:25.839
What?

27:27.292 --> 27:30.260
The Chilton,
room 305, tonight.

27:43.591 --> 27:44.758
You didn't have to come

27:44.776 --> 27:46.226
all the way over here
just to drop the case.

27:46.260 --> 27:49.196
I came here to tell you
you're doing the wrong thing.

27:49.230 --> 27:53.317
I don't need a lecture
from you on right and wrong.

27:53.368 --> 27:54.735
You once asked me
how I live with myself.

27:54.769 --> 27:57.955
Well, somewhere along the way,
I realized I had a choice

27:57.989 --> 27:59.957
not to be on the side
that made me feel like shit.

27:59.991 --> 28:03.109
You're on that side now.
Yeah, I don't feel like shit.

28:03.127 --> 28:05.045
That's because you're telling
yourself you're doing your job.

28:05.079 --> 28:06.630
And I'm telling you
that you're bullying someone

28:06.664 --> 28:07.831
who deserves your sympathy.

28:07.882 --> 28:10.918
You really want to play
the bullying card?

28:10.952 --> 28:12.636
My grandmother lost
her only son.

28:12.670 --> 28:14.120
You used her grief
against her.

28:14.138 --> 28:15.923
This has nothing to do
with that.

28:15.957 --> 28:18.058
Look, I know, you need me
to be the villain--

28:18.092 --> 28:19.059
No, no, no, no, no.

28:19.093 --> 28:20.811
You are the villain.

28:20.845 --> 28:24.431
Well, then congratulations,
because you just became me.

28:26.317 --> 28:29.436
What are you talking about?

28:31.823 --> 28:35.409
Your father had two drinks
on the night he was killed.

28:35.443 --> 28:37.077
That was the reason I was able
to get your grandmother

28:37.111 --> 28:38.695
to settle.

28:49.824 --> 28:51.625
It's not every day
I get off the elevator

28:51.659 --> 28:55.095
and find someone in my firm
that makes me look short.

28:55.129 --> 28:57.464
So you've seen
our newest client?

28:57.498 --> 28:58.999
You mean
Scottie's newest client.

28:59.017 --> 29:00.717
Michael Phelps may be
her client,

29:00.768 --> 29:02.669
but we're gonna get Speedo.

29:02.687 --> 29:05.939
And why should that
make me change my mind?

29:05.974 --> 29:07.774
Because their fee
is worth more than her buy-in.

29:07.809 --> 29:10.944
You still think
this is about money.

29:10.979 --> 29:13.847
I told this to Scottie, and now
I'm going to tell it to you.

29:13.865 --> 29:16.533
We've had too much turnover.

29:16.567 --> 29:17.851
We can't have any more.

29:17.869 --> 29:20.020
Jessica, I'm telling you
she's in.

29:20.038 --> 29:21.521
Then she shouldn't have
any problem putting her money

29:21.539 --> 29:22.623
where her mouth is.

29:22.657 --> 29:23.874
It's not right.

29:23.908 --> 29:27.527
Harvey, it's time
you and I had the talk.

29:27.545 --> 29:28.829
I know
where babies come from.

29:28.863 --> 29:31.214
But do you know how couples
stay together?

29:31.249 --> 29:32.699
What are you getting at?

29:32.717 --> 29:34.885
When Daniel and I
took over the firm,

29:34.919 --> 29:36.803
we had a heart-to-heart.

29:36.838 --> 29:39.139
He had a philosophy
that I agreed to live by.

29:39.173 --> 29:40.507
Daniel was a piece of shit.

29:40.541 --> 29:44.811
Doesn't mean
his philosophy was.

29:44.846 --> 29:46.263
I'm listening.

29:46.314 --> 29:48.882
He told me,
for a partnership to work,

29:48.900 --> 29:52.069
there has to be trust between
number one and number two.

29:52.103 --> 29:54.071
You don't have
to agree with me,

29:54.105 --> 29:56.657
but you have to trust
that I listen to you,

29:56.691 --> 29:58.358
that my decisions
are reasoned,

29:58.392 --> 30:00.360
and that I am doing
what I think is right.

30:00.394 --> 30:01.411
Jessica--

30:01.446 --> 30:02.863
You can't have
two presidents, Harvey.

30:02.897 --> 30:04.865
Now I chose to trust you
when you said

30:04.899 --> 30:06.450
you didn't want to be
managing partner.

30:06.501 --> 30:07.701
Was that true or not?

30:07.735 --> 30:08.835
It was.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.704
Then I need you
to accept this.

30:10.738 --> 30:13.073
What if I had an idea

30:13.091 --> 30:16.209
where maybe we can both get
what we want?

30:19.013 --> 30:20.413
I'm listening.

30:25.019 --> 30:27.754
That's never happened
to me before.

30:27.772 --> 30:29.422
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.975
<i>Black Hawk Down.</i>

30:32.026 --> 30:33.810
First of all,

30:33.861 --> 30:35.428
that's an amazing movie,
and you should be proud

30:35.446 --> 30:37.280
that you are associated
with it.

30:37.315 --> 30:39.783
And second of all, I think
I know what the problem is.

30:39.817 --> 30:42.602
You do?

30:42.620 --> 30:47.240
It's about what happened
in the file room.

30:47.274 --> 30:49.409
Listen, Sheila,
I can't tell you

30:49.443 --> 30:50.443
how that's been weighing
on my mind.

30:50.461 --> 30:52.612
No, I get it.

30:52.630 --> 30:56.633
Now that we've declared
our love,

30:56.667 --> 30:59.119
you think of me
as a good girl.

30:59.137 --> 31:01.088
And you need me to be bad.

31:01.122 --> 31:03.473
- What?
- It happens all the time.

31:03.508 --> 31:06.426
We're in a relationship now,
and you think that changes

31:06.460 --> 31:09.429
the nature
of our sexual relationship.

31:09.463 --> 31:12.015
But I am here to assure you...

31:12.066 --> 31:13.316
I can be bad.

31:13.351 --> 31:15.068
Okay, that's not actually
what--

31:15.103 --> 31:16.136
Liar.

31:16.154 --> 31:17.237
Whoa.

31:17.271 --> 31:18.939
Take it easy.

31:18.973 --> 31:20.741
I am being serious right now.

31:20.775 --> 31:23.476
You think
I'm not being serious?

31:23.494 --> 31:26.696
I'm deadly serious.
Ow.

31:26.748 --> 31:28.915
- Say it again.
- Ow.

31:28.950 --> 31:29.983
Ooh.

31:30.001 --> 31:33.336
Ooh.

31:33.371 --> 31:35.705
Well, what do you know?

31:35.757 --> 31:37.824
<i>The Dark Knight Rises.</i>

31:50.221 --> 31:52.172
- She went for it.
- She did?

31:52.190 --> 31:53.473
One catch.

31:53.507 --> 31:54.608
What?

31:54.642 --> 31:56.693
You have to sign
an ironclad noncompete.

31:56.727 --> 31:58.478
You can't represent

31:58.512 --> 32:00.513
any Pearson Specter clients
if you leave.

32:00.531 --> 32:03.850
- Including Phelps?
- Including Phelps.

32:03.868 --> 32:05.535
How is that any different
than paying in early?

32:05.570 --> 32:07.020
It's $1/2 million different.

32:07.038 --> 32:08.205
Harvey.

32:08.239 --> 32:12.358
Scottie, this is the best
we're gonna do.

32:12.376 --> 32:14.244
Phelps brings in the money.

32:14.295 --> 32:16.529
But if you leave
and take him away,

32:16.547 --> 32:18.331
what good does that
do Jessica?

32:18.365 --> 32:19.916
Jessica or you?

32:19.967 --> 32:22.202
Are you kidding?
Are you questioning me?

32:22.220 --> 32:24.204
You've been known
to manipulate situations before.

32:24.222 --> 32:27.507
If it were up to me,
I'd waive your whole buy-in.

32:27.541 --> 32:28.975
Now I know
you're full of shit.

32:29.010 --> 32:30.594
You're right, I am.

32:30.645 --> 32:33.379
So get your check ready, 'cause
in six months, you're paying it.

32:33.397 --> 32:36.399
Are we really doing this?

32:41.939 --> 32:45.242
Sign it.
Give it to Jessica.

32:45.276 --> 32:48.278
Tomorrow we'll celebrate
with dinner at my place.

32:51.899 --> 32:54.034
Where did you get this?

32:54.068 --> 32:56.002
Rinaldi.

32:56.037 --> 32:57.087
Mike, I know
what you're thinking,

32:57.121 --> 32:58.922
but your father
wasn't legally drunk.

32:58.956 --> 33:01.925
Yeah, but he wasn't sober
either.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.910
And how do I know
those two drinks aren't

33:03.928 --> 33:07.047
the split second
that he needed not to...

33:07.081 --> 33:08.682
You don't know
that this had

33:08.716 --> 33:10.217
anything to do
with the accident.

33:10.251 --> 33:13.687
Rachel, do you have any idea
how many times I have wished

33:13.721 --> 33:15.055
that they hadn't gone out
that night

33:15.089 --> 33:16.523
or that they had taken
a different route home

33:16.557 --> 33:18.091
or any one
of a thousand other things,

33:18.109 --> 33:20.777
but the one thing--the
one thing that I never wished

33:20.811 --> 33:22.612
is that my father
hadn't been drinking

33:22.647 --> 33:26.366
the night that he got killed
by a drunk--

33:34.125 --> 33:37.878
I know he wasn't perfect.

33:41.582 --> 33:43.633
But he was.

33:45.636 --> 33:48.505
He was perfect to me, and...

33:49.840 --> 33:50.807
I don't want
to have to wonder

33:50.841 --> 33:52.842
if this is all his fault.

33:54.095 --> 33:55.061
Mike.

33:57.965 --> 33:59.816
He is just trying
to get to you.

33:59.850 --> 34:02.018
Well, he's got to me.

34:05.022 --> 34:07.023
I mean, how am I any different
than him, Rachel?

34:07.074 --> 34:09.859
Because it's
a bullshit claim.

34:12.446 --> 34:15.864
I don't know.

34:15.917 --> 34:19.152
I know I'm gonna win.

34:22.089 --> 34:23.822
But I don't know.

34:24.717 --> 34:25.618
Ah, there you are.

34:25.619 --> 34:27.120
Been looking all over for you.
Why?

34:27.527 --> 34:29.346
I just wanted to apologize
once again

34:29.347 --> 34:31.181
for crossing the threshold
of your electronic area.

34:31.216 --> 34:32.716
It's okay, Louis.

34:32.734 --> 34:34.384
No, no, I breached
your mainframe.

34:34.402 --> 34:36.487
No excuse.

34:36.521 --> 34:38.054
Why is your face so red?

34:38.072 --> 34:40.357
It's because you gave me the
greatest advice in the world.

34:40.391 --> 34:42.159
What are you talking about?

34:42.194 --> 34:44.110
Let's just say that I'm never
gonna tell Sheila what I did

34:44.161 --> 34:45.728
in that file room
that night, ever.

34:47.232 --> 34:50.000
Apology accepted.

34:50.034 --> 34:51.001
Now if you'll excuse me,

34:51.036 --> 34:54.288
I need to put some peas
on my face.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.182
Your move didn't work.
I didn't go into a tailspin.

35:05.217 --> 35:06.917
I wasn't trying to send you
into a tailspin.

35:06.935 --> 35:08.269
I was just trying to get you
to understand.

35:08.303 --> 35:11.522
Well, I do understand.

35:11.556 --> 35:13.307
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna sell my client out.

35:13.358 --> 35:14.692
Then why are we here?

35:14.726 --> 35:16.560
You want to sue someone,
you should sue these people.

35:16.594 --> 35:18.262
They're the ones
that make the medicine

35:18.280 --> 35:20.231
that stent was coated with.

35:20.265 --> 35:22.900
And you know that medicine has
something to do with this case?

35:22.934 --> 35:24.434
I know there's
as much evidence against them

35:24.452 --> 35:25.703
as there is against my client.

35:25.737 --> 35:26.871
That's why
you're pointing me there,

35:26.905 --> 35:29.773
because they're not
your client.

35:29.791 --> 35:33.327
You know, nothing's gonna
bring Mr. Foreman back.

35:33.378 --> 35:34.411
Just like there's nothing

35:34.445 --> 35:37.781
that's gonna bring
my parents back.

35:39.217 --> 35:41.618
This is the best way I can see
to get your client compensation.

35:41.636 --> 35:43.888
If you think you're doing
the right thing, you're wrong.

35:43.922 --> 35:46.307
I'm trying to help,

35:46.341 --> 35:47.892
but I'm not gonna sell
my client out.

35:47.926 --> 35:50.728
It's a half measure.

35:57.152 --> 36:00.938
All right,
then here's the other half.

36:00.972 --> 36:02.189
I pointed out
your achilles' heel

36:02.240 --> 36:05.442
when I found that photo,
and I found it on Facebook.

36:05.476 --> 36:07.828
Do your client a favor,
and have them take it down

36:07.862 --> 36:10.647
before you file that suit.

36:13.318 --> 36:16.787
So you're gonna fly back to
London, get your life in order,

36:16.821 --> 36:19.206
and move back in two weeks.

36:19.257 --> 36:22.326
Tickets are booked.

36:22.344 --> 36:25.329
Here's to
your new partnership.

36:25.347 --> 36:28.265
I just have one question.

36:28.300 --> 36:31.018
Why did Jessica specifically
make me agree to something

36:31.052 --> 36:33.637
that's a standard part
of your contracts?

36:33.671 --> 36:35.856
You checked up on me.

36:35.890 --> 36:39.643
I didn't check up on you.
I'm thorough.

36:39.677 --> 36:40.978
What's the difference?

36:41.012 --> 36:43.030
God damn it, Harvey,
don't change the subject.

36:43.064 --> 36:46.567
What did you do?

36:46.618 --> 36:47.851
I fronted your buy-in.

36:47.869 --> 36:50.154
I knew it.
You bought me.

36:50.188 --> 36:52.356
I didn't buy you,
I bought us time.

36:52.374 --> 36:55.993
That is a lawyer's response,
and it's bullshit.

36:56.027 --> 36:57.328
How could you do that?

36:57.362 --> 36:59.463
Scottie, you're acting
like I killed someone.

36:59.497 --> 37:00.664
I didn't.

37:00.698 --> 37:03.801
You paid so that
I could sleep with you

37:03.835 --> 37:06.170
and be here at the same time!

37:06.204 --> 37:08.005
Do you know what that makes me?
Lucky?

37:08.039 --> 37:10.057
- That's not funny.
- I didn't mean it to be.

37:10.091 --> 37:12.176
I paid
because I want you to stay.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.428
I did it
as a romantic gesture.

37:14.479 --> 37:15.729
Yeah, well,<i>Pretty Woman</i>
may have been a romantic movie,

37:15.764 --> 37:16.981
but Julia Roberts
was still a hooker.

37:17.015 --> 37:18.849
Now you come up
with a movie reference?

37:18.883 --> 37:19.984
Harvey, can you imagine
how that makes me feel

37:20.018 --> 37:21.435
to find that out?

37:21.486 --> 37:23.237
Well, what do you
want me to say, huh?

37:23.271 --> 37:25.105
I'm not perfect at this,

37:25.156 --> 37:28.275
and you don't have to believe
that was romantic,

37:28.326 --> 37:30.527
but it would be nice if you
believed that I thought it was.

37:30.561 --> 37:32.663
Harvey, it would
have been romantic

37:32.697 --> 37:35.232
if you had begged me to stay
when Jessica wouldn't budge,

37:35.250 --> 37:36.700
but this,
this is not romantic.

37:36.734 --> 37:37.901
This is manipulative.

37:37.919 --> 37:39.420
You were about to take
a job somewhere else.

37:39.454 --> 37:41.038
That's what
makes it manipulative!

37:41.072 --> 37:42.840
Are you telling me you've
never been manipulative with me?

37:42.874 --> 37:44.124
Not since I've been back.

37:44.175 --> 37:45.575
I had to learn the hard way,

37:45.593 --> 37:49.513
and I'm afraid that
you haven't learned that at all.

37:49.547 --> 37:50.881
So you're saying
I'm an asshole?

37:50.915 --> 37:53.083
Yes, that is what I'm saying,
that you are an asshole,

37:53.101 --> 37:54.385
but what I'm really saying

37:54.419 --> 37:57.354
is that we need to start
being honest with each other.

37:57.389 --> 38:00.924
- About everything?
- Everything.

38:07.949 --> 38:09.233
You know that paper
you had to redo,

38:09.267 --> 38:10.951
because Professor Gunn
said he never got it?

38:10.985 --> 38:12.202
Mmhmm.

38:12.237 --> 38:13.270
He never got it.

38:13.288 --> 38:14.822
Son of a bitch.

38:14.873 --> 38:16.073
How was I supposed to know

38:16.107 --> 38:17.074
you didn't save it
to your hard drive?

38:17.108 --> 38:18.375
Because I told you that.

38:18.410 --> 38:21.912
You know I don't listen
when you say things.

38:24.499 --> 38:26.250
You are an asshole.

38:26.284 --> 38:28.001
This is good.

38:28.053 --> 38:30.220
Honesty is good.

38:30.255 --> 38:31.922
I told Rebecca Carlin
you were gay.

38:31.956 --> 38:33.724
She slept with me anyway.

38:33.758 --> 38:36.293
Once.

38:36.311 --> 38:37.394
Yeah.

38:37.429 --> 38:39.396
Why did she only
sleep with me once?

38:39.431 --> 38:42.850
Because I also told her
that you had crabs.

38:42.901 --> 38:46.303
That's not cool.

38:48.973 --> 38:50.140
This is good.

38:50.158 --> 38:52.642
It is.

38:52.660 --> 38:55.696
I am in this, Scottie.

38:55.747 --> 38:58.315
Okay.

38:58.333 --> 39:01.001
So am I.

39:03.538 --> 39:06.673
Well, let's see what you got,
Michael James Ross.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.342
Magna cum laude.

39:09.961 --> 39:12.662
So Mr. Smarty Pants couldn't
even manage summa cum laude?

39:12.680 --> 39:16.967
Yeah, well, so what
if I couldn't either?

39:17.001 --> 39:18.685
What? No <i>Law Review?</i>

39:18.720 --> 39:21.054
Well, either you weren't asked,
or you didn't serve.

39:21.106 --> 39:23.390
Either way, I win.

39:23.441 --> 39:25.559
"A."

39:25.610 --> 39:27.611
"A."

39:27.645 --> 39:29.696
B-plus in International Law?

39:29.731 --> 39:33.617
Oh, come on, I aced that class
with my eyes closed.

39:33.651 --> 39:35.569
"A" in contracts.
That's legit.

39:35.620 --> 39:39.823
A-minus in Estate Planning?

39:39.857 --> 39:42.993
Remind me to not die intestate
with Mike Ross around.

39:56.641 --> 39:58.258
Tape measure,
as requested.

39:58.309 --> 39:59.643
You look really excited.

39:59.677 --> 40:01.345
- Long day.
- I know.

40:01.379 --> 40:02.513
Is there any chance
we can punt this,

40:02.547 --> 40:03.847
maybe go grab some dinner?

40:03.881 --> 40:08.435
We could, or we could accept
that moving in together

40:08.486 --> 40:13.390
sometimes means we have to
just shake off our crappy days

40:13.408 --> 40:15.859
and deal with things
like furniture negotiations.

40:15.893 --> 40:17.027
Yeah, that doesn't sound

40:17.061 --> 40:18.541
like anything
I want to accept at all.

40:18.563 --> 40:20.063
Too bad.

40:20.081 --> 40:22.866
This is your life now.

40:22.900 --> 40:25.169
Rachel, look, I'm trying...

40:28.573 --> 40:32.742
You said that your dad liked
to celebrate the little things,

40:32.760 --> 40:35.712
and I thought maybe we
should start doing that too.

40:35.746 --> 40:38.382
You mean like
furniture negotiations?

40:38.416 --> 40:42.853
Mmm, I mean
our first date.

40:42.887 --> 40:44.521
So does that mean I'm not
gonna be able to eat anything?

40:44.556 --> 40:46.773
'Cause I didn't like anything
on the menu that night.

40:46.808 --> 40:49.226
That wasn't our first date.

40:49.260 --> 40:53.614
Our first date
was in the law library.

40:53.648 --> 40:56.700
- Sushi.
- Sushi.

40:56.734 --> 40:58.869
That was my first case.

40:58.903 --> 41:00.871
I know.

41:00.905 --> 41:03.624
Oh, you were so green.

41:03.658 --> 41:05.542
Harvey came in and told us
to stop playing footsie.

41:05.577 --> 41:06.960
Oh, I remember that.

41:06.995 --> 41:09.112
I wanted to do a lot more
than play footsie with you.

41:09.130 --> 41:10.214
I know.

41:10.248 --> 41:11.665
I caught you staring at me
five times.

41:11.716 --> 41:13.250
Oh, so I guess you didn't
catch all the other times then.

41:13.284 --> 41:15.469
I did, just trying to let you
off the hook.

41:15.503 --> 41:18.722
Rachel...

41:18.756 --> 41:19.790
This is perfect.

41:19.824 --> 41:22.593
Not yet.

41:29.767 --> 41:32.436
Now it is.

41:32.470 --> 41:33.687
So where's the chair?

41:33.738 --> 41:35.188
No.

41:41.996 --> 41:43.413
You wanted to see me?

41:43.448 --> 41:46.316
Professor Gerard's
legal ethics class--you take it?

41:46.334 --> 41:47.651
Of course,
everyone had to take it.

41:47.669 --> 41:48.669
What'd you get?

41:48.703 --> 41:51.655
Killed it.
I got an A-minus.

41:51.673 --> 41:52.923
Out of curiosity,

41:52.957 --> 41:54.675
did you ever hear of anybody
ever getting an A-plus?

41:54.709 --> 41:56.426
What? No.

41:56.461 --> 41:58.178
He's famous for never
giving higher than an "A."

41:58.212 --> 41:59.630
He doesn't believe in it.

41:59.664 --> 42:02.666
Thank you, Simon.
That'll be all.
