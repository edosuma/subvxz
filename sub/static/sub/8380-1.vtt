00:04.304 --> 00:05.942
<i>What are they saying about Bush?</i>

00:06.106 --> 00:07.551
Does he deserve reelection?

00:07.774 --> 00:11.051
<i>And here are the numbers.
Forty-five percent say yes...</i>

00:11.278 --> 00:13.451
<i>0,49 percent say no.</i>

00:13.647 --> 00:15.786
<i>Democrats, 84 percent say no.</i>

00:15.983 --> 00:18.190
<i>Eighty-four percent of Republicans
say yes.</i>

00:18.385 --> 00:22.162
<i>Independents, 51 percent now say
he does not deserve reelection.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.030
<i>- That's a red ï¬‚ag.
- And what about for John Kerry?</i>

00:25.225 --> 00:27.034
<i>- Is that good news?
- It should be.</i>

00:27.227 --> 00:30.003
<i>Look at John Kerry's numbers, Tom.
Positive-negative.</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:33.508
<i>Positive 38 percent,
negative 38 percent.</i>

00:33.667 --> 00:35.908
<i>This thing is still</i> a <i>toss-up.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:48.083
Mr. Hibey will see you now.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.551
Thank ya...

00:50.851 --> 00:52.694
Ms. Mapes.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.999
I'm Dick Hibey. What can I do for you?

00:56.189 --> 00:58.533
Oh, I think you know.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.699
- You knit?
- You don't expect a woman like me...

01:01.895 --> 01:04.602
- to knit?
- No. But it's good. It's helpful.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.744
Yeah. You mean it blunts
my radical feminist agenda.

01:07.935 --> 01:11.883
- Do you have a radical feminist agenda?
- You meet a lot of radical leaders?

01:12.773 --> 01:15.049
Do you have
a substance abuse problem?

01:15.208 --> 01:16.778
I'm working on developing one.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.921
- I'm serious.
- Oh, so am I.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.251
You came to me.
If you're not up for this...

01:21.448 --> 01:24.918
I've been in news for 20 years.
Won two Emmys, broke Abu Ghraib...

01:25.118 --> 01:29.066
done jail time for not revealing sources.
I have neither a feminist agenda...

01:29.256 --> 01:32.362
nor a substance abuse problem.
Though I'm gonna take a Xanax...

01:32.559 --> 01:34.732
because this
is really freaking me out.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.138
Get any water?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.212
- Thanks.
- You have to be ready...

01:50.377 --> 01:53.654
- for questions like that.
- I'm up for this.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.795
There's an interesting recurring theme...

02:00.954 --> 02:02.661
- to the stories you cover.
- Mm-hm.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.665
- People abusing their power.
- I don't like bullies.

02:06.493 --> 02:07.836
Tell me about your work.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.674
You wanna know if I'm responsible
for what happened.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.642
- Aren't you?
- Look, I did my job. Believe me.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.337
I don't have to believe you.

02:16.570 --> 02:20.245
What matters is that they believe you.
Now, tell me about your work.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.925
I'm the producer. I find the story.

02:27.114 --> 02:30.618
I put the team together.
I write and cut the piece.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.819
I work at <i>60 Minutes.</i>

02:33.020 --> 02:34.966
And what's that like?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
Which one of you ordered the duck?

02:39.092 --> 02:40.696
- That would be Tom.
- Napkin.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.863
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Fatso.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.443
- They're gonna run it this time?
- They're gonna run it.

02:46.967 --> 02:50.278
- Because you said that last week.
- They're gonna run it, Roger.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.814
Hey, uh, you want me
to paint it out like this?

02:53.006 --> 02:57.216
Oh, Jesus, no, it makes his genitals look
like they were attacked by mad cubists.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.447
Um...

02:58.612 --> 03:01.559
Maybe you could just
kind of darken the area.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.318
Okay. Ahem.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.719
Like that?

03:07.154 --> 03:10.067
Okay, now it just looks like
there's a black hole there.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.197
From which no light can escape.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.066
They're really gonna run it?

03:14.294 --> 03:15.671
Because Sy Hersh has this...

03:15.862 --> 03:18.866
and he's gonna write a story
about how we've sat on it.

03:19.066 --> 03:23.071
Dana, can you tell Roger they're gonna
run it, then hit him for me, will you'!

03:23.303 --> 03:25.010
I gotta go grab him.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.919
Can you finish it? Mm-hm.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.489
He was the first journalist to report
John F. Kennedy had been shot.

03:32.913 --> 03:37.726
He described the Zapruder film in detail
to a nation...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.027
that was not allowed to see it.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.593
Became White House correspondent
at the age of 33...

03:43.824 --> 03:46.168
chief London correspondent
a year later...

03:46.359 --> 03:50.899
and brought the Vietnam War into
American living rooms for the first time.

03:51.264 --> 03:55.269
He covered the Russians in Afghanistan,
the hostages in Iran...

03:55.502 --> 03:59.279
<i>and in</i> 1981, <i>became anchor
of the CBS Evening News.</i>

03:59.506 --> 04:01.918
He's now anchored
more nightly news broadcasts...

04:02.109 --> 04:05.215
than anyone else in U.S. history.

04:05.612 --> 04:09.185
That's no! Bad for the son of
a ditch-digger from Wharton, Texas.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.590
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you my friend...

04:12.953 --> 04:17.095
and the reason I have this job,
Dan Rather.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.078
Long enough to give us
a great market share, I'll tell you.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.808
- It's been a real pleasure. Real pleasure.
- Hey, Andrew, I need him.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.748
- Well, you're not taking him.
- You say that, but here I am.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.117
- You got him?
- Mm-hm. In a hotel two blocks up.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.052
- Let's go.
- Dan, you can't leave your own party.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.820
- I got 50 affiliates and their wives...
- I know.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.657
- Waiting to talk with you. Goddamn it.
- I know.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.992
You wanna finish this off'?
I've had three.

04:51.018 --> 04:51.793
Mary.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.299
I'll take that for you, Mr. Hayward.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.830
You know?

04:56.062 --> 04:58.133
General. This is Dan Rather.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.906
- General.
- Sir.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.241
Thank you for doing this.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.520
Let's start from the beginning.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.932
<i>Americans did this to an Iraqi prisoner.</i>

05:30.130 --> 05:33.270
<i>According to the Army,
the man was told to stand on a box...</i>

05:33.433 --> 05:36.346
<i>his head covered with wires
attached to his hands.</i>

05:36.770 --> 05:40.513
<i>He was told that if he fell off the box,
he would be electrocuted.</i>

05:40.707 --> 05:42.948
<i>It was this picture
and dozens of others...</i>

05:43.143 --> 05:45.851
<i>that prompted an investigation
by the U.S. Army.</i>

05:46.046 --> 05:48.322
<i>Yesterday, we asked
General Mark Kimmitt...</i>

05:48.515 --> 05:51.291
<i>deputy director
of coalition operations in Iraq...</i>

05:51.484 --> 05:52.622
<i>what went wrong.</i>

05:52.819 --> 05:55.732
<i>Every day we love our soldiers,
but frankly...</i>

05:55.956 --> 05:58.800
<i>some days we're not always
proud of our soldiers.</i>

05:59.793 --> 06:02.000
<i>The military says six American soldiers...</i>

06:02.162 --> 06:03.362
have been charged so far...

06:03.496 --> 06:05.737
<i>and could be court-martialed.
Others higher...</i>

06:05.899 --> 06:08.573
<i>min the chain of command
will likely be disciplined.</i>

06:08.802 --> 06:12.750
I remember when you used to say
"courage" at the end of every broadcast.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.977
- You remember that?
- I remember. Do you remember'?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.678
You must be very old.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.415
- Why'd you stop?
- They made fun of him, that's why.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.184
- No.
- No, they did.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.918
- Seriously. Imagine?
- Oh, yeah.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.096
Go on, give us a "courage," Dan.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.356
- No, come on. Mary.
- Come on, just one.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.034
- For me.
- I don't think so.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.260
- For me, for me.
- Come on.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.994
Just a little one.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.333
<i>Cum-Ha, ha.</i>

06:37.497 --> 06:40.103
- Come on, please.
- Come on.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.280
- You really want it?
- I want it too, yeah.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.538
Courage.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.852
- Well, it worked at one time.
- It did. It did.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.682
Hey. Here's to a great story.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.724
Yeah, once they finally ran it.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.022
- Yeah.
- F.E.A.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.358
F.E.A.

07:03.723 --> 07:06.431
We're sitting here with Mommy.
Thank you for being here.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.400
No. Thank you for having me.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.941
Mommy, you were away
for a long time again.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.238
- Mm-hm.
- What were you doing?

07:15.402 --> 07:17.439
I was in New York working on the news.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.645
And what does that entail?

07:19.873 --> 07:23.446
I was asking questions.
Questions help reporters get to the truth.

07:23.643 --> 07:26.624
- Were you with the men with the cameras?
- Mm-hm.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.053
Interesting.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.936
Can I have a new
camera, please?

07:32.962 --> 07:35.314
We'll have to talk to
your dad about that.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.946
I'm trying to get to
the truth here, Mommy.

07:37.972 --> 07:38.585
Mm-hm.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.260
Answer the question.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.899
I think this interview is over.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.303
- Okay.
- Nice try.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.172
<i>President Bush said today...</i>

07:47.334 --> 07:49.507
he <i>was disgusted
by pictures of Iraqi prisoners...</i>

07:49.669 --> 07:51.910
<i>being abused by American soldiers.</i>

07:52.105 --> 07:54.085
Caused a bit of a ruckus, didn't you?

07:54.274 --> 07:57.812
Who, me?
You didn't let Robbie watch it, did you?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.658
Yes, because
I'm the worst parent of all time.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.020
<i>And the damage to U. S. interests...</i>

08:03.249 --> 08:05.855
in <i>the rest of the world
is hard to calculate, but...</i>

08:06.019 --> 08:09.626
- You <i>wanna take</i> a walk?
<i>- Here's Martha Raddatz.</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:12.834
No, I think I have to work.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.605
Mary, thanks for coming in.
Look, no big preamble.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.642
We love you.
We love what you've done. It's...

08:21.935 --> 08:25.109
Let's talk about the new season.
What are you thinking?

08:25.305 --> 08:28.184
I might have something
for the election.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.550
There's this Houston businessman
named Bill White...

08:31.778 --> 08:35.385
who claims that he has documents
that show the bin Laden family...

08:35.615 --> 08:37.219
were investors in Arbusto.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.861
Arbusto? Bush's oil company?

08:40.053 --> 08:44.229
You know, could just be lots of sound
and fury, but <i>Vanity Fair</i> is into it too.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.532
You know,
that whole time period for Bush is funky.

08:47.727 --> 08:48.797
Funky how?

08:48.995 --> 08:51.134
Well, I did some work on it
back in 2000.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.573
- You know Ben Barnes?
- No.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.837
Oh, he's an old Texas pol.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.210
Barnes says when he was
the speaker of the Texas House...

08:59.406 --> 09:01.352
in '68 during Vietnam...

09:01.541 --> 09:04.488
Sid Adger, this big oilman,
comes into his office...

09:04.677 --> 09:06.884
and asks for help
getting George Bush...

09:07.080 --> 09:09.321
into the National Guard as a pilot.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.019
And Poppy Bush at this point
is a congressman...

09:12.218 --> 09:14.562
and Barnes figures
he can use the connections.

09:14.754 --> 09:19.362
So he says that he called General Rose,
who runs the Texas Air National Guard...

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061
and gets Bush his slot.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.068
Barnes told you this?

09:23.263 --> 09:26.039
Off the record. He's been dining out
on the story for years.

09:26.332 --> 09:29.006
I call Buck Staudt,
Bush's squadron commander...

09:29.202 --> 09:33.514
and he starts screaming at me,
saying how Barnes is full of shit...

09:33.706 --> 09:38.212
because everybody knows he's the one
who got Bush into the Guard, not Barnes.

09:38.411 --> 09:43.121
Anyway, while Bush is in the Guard,
he meets this guy named James Bath.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.919
And they become running buddies.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.895
And after they get out, Bath,
with no rÃ©sumÃ© to speak of...

09:49.089 --> 09:51.399
becomes
chief financial representative...

09:51.591 --> 09:54.128
for the bin Laden family's interests
in Texas.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.898
Bush starts up Arbusto,
Bath writes him a $50,000 check.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.807
Which your guy, White,
claims is bin Laden money?

10:04.237 --> 10:08.117
Okay. Okay, run it down.

10:08.308 --> 10:12.154
But if we go with this, we gotta go early.
We can't October surprise them.

10:12.378 --> 10:16.258
All right. If you're into this, I'd like
to bring in some other people to help.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.951
Who?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.721
Colonel Roger Charles.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.667
<i>Worked Abu Ghraib for us.
Naval Academy grad.</i>

10:24.891 --> 10:27.497
<i>Two tours at Vietnam,
then the Pentagon.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:32.838
<i>When he's not working for us, he's trying
to get better armor for troops in Iraq.</i>

10:33.566 --> 10:34.601
Who else?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.838
<i>Well, since Dana's on maternity leave...</i>

10:37.003 --> 10:38.607
<i>I'd like Lucy Scott to run point.</i>

10:38.805 --> 10:42.275
<i>She's</i> a <i>CBS veteran,
journalism professor in Dallas.</i>

10:42.475 --> 10:44.921
What about this man, Mike Smith?

10:45.111 --> 10:47.891
Mikey cut his teeth
working for Molly Ivins.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.449
He was a researcher
for us back in 2000.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.188
<i>Last I heard, he was</i> a <i>stringer
for People.com.</i> ..

10:53.419 --> 10:56.593
<i>â€œSneaking into parties
to find out who's sleeping with who.</i>

10:56.789 --> 11:00.703
Now, when you say "sport-fucking,"
he was just putting it to her for fun...

11:00.927 --> 11:04.306
or he's like actively attempting
to compete at it?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.638
It is a crack team.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.439
Trust me.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.618
You really gonna do it this time?

11:17.944 --> 11:20.322
Your evil corporate overlords
will let you?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.049
Good to see you too, Mikey.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.819
CBS is talking
about closing foreign bureaus...

11:25.018 --> 11:27.658
moving into more
of a bullshit infotainment direction.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.500
They won't touch the news division,
as long as Dan's there.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.298
Dan's not gonna be there forever.
They'll find a way to get the old man out.

11:36.029 --> 11:40.171
Why did he even get into journalism
if he's not gonna do the tough stories?

11:42.168 --> 11:43.476
How you doing, Mikey?

11:43.836 --> 11:45.907
Heh, heh...

11:46.072 --> 11:47.710
Um...

11:48.308 --> 11:50.413
I'm eating ramen three meals a day...

11:51.411 --> 11:53.584
stealing cable.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.416
I could use a job.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.525
Come in, meet everybody.

12:04.490 --> 12:07.369
Well, hell's bells,
you brought me a hippy?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.404
This is Mike Smith,
we worked on this together in 2000.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.373
- He has no social graces whatsoever.
- That's true.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.342
Your Arbusto tip, it's for shit.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.538
Bin Laden money
never got near Bush.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.882
Okay. un...

12:21.074 --> 12:22.280
What am I doing here?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.622
What you're looking at
is George W. Bush's...

12:25.845 --> 12:27.950
entire Texas Air National Guard file.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.560
- You mean what's left of it, right?
- That's affirmative.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.458
Wait, wait, wait.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.701
You guys are doing a paper trail.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.461
Let me show you what we've got.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.068
It starts right here.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.539
May 1968.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.735
Bloodiest month of the Vietnam War.

12:48.935 --> 12:52.610
Bush is accepted into the Texas Air
National Guard for pilot training.

12:52.805 --> 12:56.048
And if you believe Ben Barnes,
he got Bush onto the waiting list.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.382
If there ever was a waiting list.
Some say yes, some say no.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.651
Bush says he got in quickly
because they were looking for pilots...

13:02.815 --> 13:05.921
which is bullshit with the pilots
rotating back in from Vietnam.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.462
And that's another thing.

13:07.654 --> 13:11.158
Training a National Guard pilot
from start to finish, that's a huge rarity.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.234
- Why?
- It's not cost-effective.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.837
Air National Guard jocks...

13:15.061 --> 13:18.167
they're former Air Force pilots
who wanna maintain their ratings.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.311
Why spend a million bucks
training some new pilot...

13:21.501 --> 13:24.414
when you can get some guy
the Air Force taught how to ï¬‚y.

13:24.604 --> 13:29.246
Only thing that makes Bush an attractive
candidate is who he's connected to.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.854
Well, either way, he's in.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.684
He signs on for a six-year commitment.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.757
He does his pilot training at Moody...

13:36.949 --> 13:40.522
then he's assigned to the 111th
Fighter Intercept Squadron in Houston.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.495
Now, the record shows
that he does really well here.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.467
High marks at every rating period,
until the spring of 1972...

13:47.660 --> 13:52.336
when he is suspended in writing
for missing a routine physical.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.342
How does someone go
from being a top-notch pilot...

13:55.535 --> 13:57.105
to not even taking a physical?

13:57.303 --> 14:01.308
Well, not only that, but he requests
and he is granted...

14:01.507 --> 14:05.717
a reassignment to Alabama where he
helps a friend on his senate campaign.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.949
Wait, so he disobeys an order
and then they let him transfer?

14:09.148 --> 14:10.957
Oh, hey, it gets better.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.960
From May 1972 to May 1973...

14:14.153 --> 14:18.624
the record shows there are no points
registered on Bush's record.

14:18.825 --> 14:22.796
Points. They're like hours on a time card
in the Guard.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.807
What it basically means
is that Bush never even showed up.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.912
The Alabama commander,
he has no recollection of him.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.412
No eyewitness can place him
on that base.

14:32.638 --> 14:36.245
Find there is no paperwork
to prove that he was ever there.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.480
So you're telling me that
the president of the United Slates...

14:39.679 --> 14:43.252
may have gone AWOL from the military
for over a year?

14:43.483 --> 14:44.826
We have no proof of that.

14:47.153 --> 14:50.191
- What does the White House say?
- That Bush served honorably...

14:50.390 --> 14:52.700
and military records go missing
all the time.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.771
Military records do not go missing
all the time.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.839
They're the military.
They are good at shit.

14:59.031 --> 15:04.071
Now, the next time Bush appears on the
official record is in July of 1973...

15:04.270 --> 15:05.943
when he shows up for drills.

15:06.172 --> 15:09.346
And then in September of 1973...

15:09.542 --> 15:14.753
he requests and he is granted
an early discharge. Why?

15:14.947 --> 15:19.293
So that he can attend
Harvard Business School.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.227
So he asks to quit nine months early
and they just let him.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.028
So, what are the questions
we're looking to answer?

15:25.224 --> 15:28.296
One, did Bush go into the Guard
to avoid going to Vietnam?

15:28.528 --> 15:32.635
Not to be cynical, but who didn't try to get
into the Guard to avoid 'Nam back then?

15:32.865 --> 15:34.538
Me.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.975
Bush's trainer in the 147th
said he wanted to go to Vietnam.

15:38.204 --> 15:42.653
There's only one document that deals
with that in the official record.

15:42.875 --> 15:47.381
On the question
of desiring overseas transfer...

15:47.914 --> 15:48.949
Bush checked no.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.061
Bush's trainer said
that must have been a mistake.

15:52.251 --> 15:56.063
- Because that's a question you get wrong.
- Two, why did he skip his physical?

15:56.255 --> 15:59.998
Well, ifs not like he had a drug problem.
He just liked the way it smelled.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.263
Okay, three.

16:02.462 --> 16:06.740
If someone did get him into the Guard,
then who?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.781
How the hell do we get them
to go on the record?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.779
Forty-one percent say...

16:12.939 --> 16:15.783
<i>they want Mr. Bush reelected,
while 51 percent don't.</i>

16:15.942 --> 16:19.355
Is it that time of year again already...

16:19.579 --> 16:25.120
when I have to fend off the advances
of a beautiful woman such as yourself?

16:25.318 --> 16:30.825
Governor, you got the president of the
United States into the National Guard.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.436
I mean, my God,
I find that very impressive.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.507
Ha. It is impressive, isn't it?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.438
Come on TV, tell us all about it.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.375
<i>Oh, we both knew if I ever said that...</i>

16:42.602 --> 16:47.210
"about Texas' favorite son on camera,
I'd be run out of Austin on a rail."

16:47.440 --> 16:49.181
No, sorry, Mary.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.686
Johnny's gonna win this thing, anyway.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.653
<i>Barnes is still</i> a <i>no. Who's next?</i>

16:57.116 --> 17:00.120
Colonel Jerry Killian.
Bush's CO in the 111th.

17:00.319 --> 17:02.560
If anyone will know what really went on,
he will.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.028
Small problem there.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.396
- Which is?
- Killian's dead.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.727
Huh.

17:08.493 --> 17:11.202
- That's a pickle.
- Who's next?

17:11.396 --> 17:12.535
General Buck Staudt.

17:12.732 --> 17:16.305
Former CO
of Bush's 147th Interceptor Squadron.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.742
<i>George was
one of the best pilots I ever had.</i>

17:18.971 --> 17:21.178
<i>So Tm gonna respectfully invite you
to go fuck yourself.</i>

17:23.409 --> 17:24.648
General Bobby Hodges...

17:24.844 --> 17:28.587
succeeded Staudt as commander
of the 147th, Killian's direct supervisor.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.487
My husband says...

17:30.650 --> 17:32.011
<i>no strings were pulled for him.</i>

17:32.151 --> 17:34.392
<i>Now, please stop calling our house.</i>

17:36.722 --> 17:38.998
Maurice Udell, Bush's ï¬‚ight instructor.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.864
No strings were pulled for him.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.460
<i>I thought he'd be</i> a <i>great American
and</i> a <i>great fighter pilot.</i>

17:45.932 --> 17:47.377
Tom Honeycutt.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.410
<i>No strings were putted.</i>

17:51.671 --> 17:52.877
Albert Lloyd.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.272
<i>No strings were putted.</i>

17:55.541 --> 17:56.576
Motherf...

17:59.178 --> 18:00.521
Bill Hollowell.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.056
<i>No strings were putted.</i>

18:02.248 --> 18:04.194
<i>And even if they were, it's a non issue,.</i>

18:04.383 --> 18:06.863
<i>Hey! Hey! Move, you son of</i> a <i>bitch!</i>

18:13.793 --> 18:16.273
<i>It was like they were given talking points.</i>

18:16.429 --> 18:19.103
<i>He was</i>
a <i>great guy, no strings were pulled.</i>

18:19.298 --> 18:22.768
Well, devil's advocate, Mary.
What if no strings were pulled?

18:22.969 --> 18:25.279
You know who else was in the 147th?

18:25.471 --> 18:26.711
Lloyd Bentsen's son...

18:26.906 --> 18:29.477
John Connally's son,
both of Sid Adger's sons...

18:29.709 --> 18:32.883
H.L. Hunt's grandson,
the heirs to the Sakowitz fortune...

18:33.079 --> 18:36.060
<i>and half the starting line
of the Dallas Cowboys.</i>

18:36.248 --> 18:38.228
Yeah, I'm sure ifs just a coincidence.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.924
So, what's our next move?

18:42.922 --> 18:45.163
I have no idea.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.766
<i>- I served with John Kerry.
- I served with John Kerry.</i>

18:48.961 --> 18:52.408
<i>Kerry has not been honest
about what happened in Vietnam.</i>

18:52.598 --> 18:53.770
<i>He is lying about his record.</i>

18:53.966 --> 18:57.175
I know John Kerry is lying
about his first Purple Heart...

18:57.403 --> 18:58.814
<i>"because I treated him."</i>

18:59.005 --> 19:01.076
<i>John Kerry lied to get his Bronze Star.</i>

19:01.273 --> 19:02.874
<i>I know, I was there,
I saw what happened.</i>

19:04.276 --> 19:07.746
<i>His account of what happened
and what actually happened...</i>

19:07.947 --> 19:10.518
<i>are the difference
between night and day.</i>

19:10.750 --> 19:12.286
Who is that?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.294
My secret lover, go back to sleep.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.593
<i>Have you ever heard of Linda Starr?</i>

19:17.923 --> 19:18.958
Mm-hm.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.696
<i>She runs this website, it's like
a Gearing house for anti-Bush stuff.</i>

19:22.928 --> 19:27.001
<i>She's hinting documents
are gonna be leaked soon.</i>

19:27.767 --> 19:29.110
What kind of documents?

19:30.136 --> 19:32.138
Mary Mapes is on line two.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.976
Thank you.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.483
- Mary.
<i>- I think we've got something.</i>

19:37.677 --> 19:39.782
Anti-Bush, Internet rabble-rouser.

19:39.979 --> 19:44.894
Oh, God, I talked to her for three hours,
but she put me in touch with her source.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.324
A colonel
who says he may have access...

19:47.520 --> 19:50.126
to missing documents
in Bush's purged Guard file.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.223
Sounds promising.

19:51.249 --> 19:53.887
I got Mike Smith talking
to him right now.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.904
<i>- Milk?
- Get a look at those documents.</i>

19:57.129 --> 20:00.508
And do some background on the colonel,
make sure he isn't nuts.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.343
Thank you.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.481
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.421
Ahem. No. I saw it.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.658
I saw it with my own two eyes. Those
parts of Bush's file they didn't like...

20:16.849 --> 20:19.557
- they tossed in the wastebasket.
- Do you have these?

20:19.752 --> 20:23.529
Bill tried to talk about this in 2000,
someone ran us off the road one night.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.694
- I ain't scared of them.
- Well, I am. I am scared.

20:28.194 --> 20:32.609
All right, uh, let's say
I have the documents.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.903
Why should I show them to you?
Why not one of the newspapers?

20:37.103 --> 20:40.744
- Because nobody reads newspapers.
- One of the other networks, then.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.716
Don't know if you've noticed,
there's not too many people...

20:43.876 --> 20:46.049
who actually do
what we do anymore.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.249
We're 60 Minutes.
We're the gold standard.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.359
We can help you.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.455
Look, you come on camera...

20:54.687 --> 20:56.633
No. No. No cameras.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.392
Our name stays out of this.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.094
They will destroy us for this,
don't you understand?

21:01.293 --> 21:05.139
Nicki, listen.
I know what ifs like to be bullied.

21:05.364 --> 21:08.709
To feel like they're too strong,
and you're small and powerless.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.539
But you're not.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.738
And doing this will show them that.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.311
Now, I promise...

21:14.540 --> 21:17.146
we will protect you.

21:49.909 --> 21:53.186
- These are signed by Jerry Killian.
- Yes, they are.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.621
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:56.615 --> 21:58.816
The first one says
that Bush made no attempt...

21:58.984 --> 22:01.828
to meet his training certification.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.298
That is a big difference
than just missing his physical.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.938
And the second one
refers to his pilot position as critical.

22:09.128 --> 22:12.871
Well, Bush said he stopped ï¬‚ying
because they no longer needed pilots.

22:13.098 --> 22:16.705
Mm-hm. But this document
would prove that statement untrue.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.644
Can you think of anybody
who'd wanna fool you with these...

22:19.805 --> 22:21.876
like a political dirty trick?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.815
I can't think of anyone
who would hate me that much.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.389
And do you have the originals
of these?

22:28.614 --> 22:31.288
No. No, I was only given copies.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.624
And don't ask me where I got them,
I'm not gonna tell you anything else.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.995
You get your own experts if you want to,
you have them look at them.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.000
We will.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.739
September 15th,
we don't have a show.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.841
<i>CBS is running
The Billy Graham Crusade.</i>

22:47.032 --> 22:48.568
What <i>about</i> the <i>22nd?</i>

22:48.734 --> 22:51.237
Preempted again. Dr. Phil special.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.882
So our air date is decided
by an unholy conï¬‚uence...

22:54.039 --> 22:56.383
between Billy Graham
and Dr. Phil McGraw?

22:56.809 --> 22:59.813
- Jesus.
- News doesn't pay the bills.

23:00.145 --> 23:01.556
There is one more option.

23:01.914 --> 23:05.157
- The 8th.
- As in five days from now?

23:07.519 --> 23:09.692
<i>- If you don't think...
- I need interviews.</i>

23:09.889 --> 23:13.359
I need to get the whole team to New York
and I need... First, I need Dan.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.731
Where is he?

23:14.927 --> 23:18.898
<i>Hurricane Frances
is pounding the Florida coast...</i>

23:19.098 --> 23:22.545
<i>harder than</i> a <i>strongman trying
to win</i> a <i>Kewpie doll at</i> a <i>carnival!</i>

23:22.735 --> 23:24.772
I'm gonna kill him.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.114
You may not have to.

23:30.609 --> 23:35.024
Maybe I can get him on a puddle jumper
to Austin for the Strong interview.

23:35.214 --> 23:39.594
I got an e-mail from the colonel about
the documents saying, "I feel better."

23:43.856 --> 23:45.699
- Yeah?
- A memorandum for record...

23:45.891 --> 23:47.529
is a memo to nobody, right'?

23:47.726 --> 23:49.535
<i>So why does Killian file them?</i>

23:49.695 --> 23:53.575
Well, Killian knows suspending a guy
this protected is a big deal.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.771
He's trying to do the right thing here, but
he needs a paper trail to insulate himself.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.816
Which means Bush's protection
must've come from higher up than Killian.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.420
You're thinking Hodges?

24:04.610 --> 24:08.217
He was Killian's direct supervisor.
I'll call you back.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.743
<i>You have
reached the Hodges' residence.</i>

24:19.758 --> 24:21.760
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

24:22.661 --> 24:24.902
<i>General Hodges,
Mary Mapes from</i> 60 <i>Minutes.</i>

24:25.097 --> 24:27.475
I was wondering
if you could give me a call back.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.737
Holy shit!

24:29.902 --> 24:34.351
Oh, ho, ho, you gotta see this.
It's a video from a cell phone...

24:34.573 --> 24:37.019
at a Democratic fundraiser.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.565
<i>Now... Thank you. Thank you.</i>

24:39.678 --> 24:43.455
<i>Now, let's talk about John Kerry
and George Bush...</i>

24:43.649 --> 24:46.653
<i>- Is that Ben Barnes?
- And I'm not name-dropping.</i>

24:48.187 --> 24:51.464
<i>You see, I got a young man
named George Bush...</i>

24:51.657 --> 24:53.377
<i>into the Air National Guard
when I was...</i>

24:53.525 --> 24:55.835
<i>- . "lieutenant governor of Texas'"
- Oh...</i>

24:56.028 --> 24:58.770
<i>Now, I'm not necessarily
proud of that, but...</i>

24:58.964 --> 25:00.671
Holy shit!

25:00.866 --> 25:05.542
I didn't know they were taping me.
Did you see it? I looked like shit!

25:05.771 --> 25:10.117
- I thought you looked wonderful, Ben.
- Oh, don't you start.

25:10.275 --> 25:13.449
The cat's already out of the bag
and your man Kerry's 10 points down.

25:13.645 --> 25:17.491
We're airing this piece in five days.
Are you in or not?

25:18.217 --> 25:20.959
- We got him! We got Barnes!
- Burkett just called.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.157
- He's got more memos to hand off.
- We need to find his source.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.199
- Okay.
- Be at the airport in the morning.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.498
<i>- I'll</i> fax you when I get there.
- Yes!

25:33.032 --> 25:36.377
"Bush wasn't here during rating
and I don't have any feedback..."

25:36.568 --> 25:43.144
"from 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.
Austin is not happy either."

25:44.476 --> 25:46.752
"Bush was not here
during rating period."

25:46.979 --> 25:51.928
They're trying to get Killian to file a
rating for Bush while he wasn't even on base.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.729
This is proof he was AWOL.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.597
Who do I talk to first?

26:02.828 --> 26:06.833
Is there any doubt in your mind
that these memos are genuine?

26:07.166 --> 26:11.342
Well, they are compatible with the way
business was done at that time.

26:11.537 --> 26:14.780
They are compatible with the man
that I remember Jerry Killian being.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.783
And what do you think Colonel Killian
was trying to do?

26:18.010 --> 26:20.684
I think he was trying
to get a duty performed...

26:20.879 --> 26:25.225
and he was trying to protect himself
because of the political environment.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.797
So political considerations
were a major force in the Guard?

26:34.259 --> 26:38.537
It verged on outright corruption,
the favors that were done...

26:38.730 --> 26:41.108
the power that was traded.

26:41.533 --> 26:44.139
From a moral and ethical standpoint...

26:44.870 --> 26:46.747
it was unconscionable.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.243
Let's go to New York.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.763
I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.128
- Dan Rather.
- No shit.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.134
I mean, I'm Mike Smith. I'm familiar...

27:08.327 --> 27:11.501
I mean... I... I... I'm... Hello.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.737
You know, Mary tells me you're the one
that calls me "the old man."

27:15.934 --> 27:21.077
Well, I... I really wish
she hadn't shared that with you.

27:22.574 --> 27:26.454
Look, I appreciate the hard work
you're doing on this.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.251
Asking questions, that's important.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.826
Some people are gonna say
it doesn't matter.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.964
One side or the other's always gonna say
you're being partisan.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.499
But you stop asking questions,
that's when the American people lose.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.330
Now, that may sound hokey,
but I believe it.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.664
So keep it up.

27:43.862 --> 27:48.208
<i>Y- Yeah-Or no. Thank you.</i>

27:48.433 --> 27:51.039
- You're welcome.
- Heh.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.477
You know what's crazy?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.381
Many things are crazy.

27:58.610 --> 28:02.649
Tell me specifically
what you feel is crazy.

28:02.848 --> 28:06.159
The fact that they kept this secret
for so long.

28:09.655 --> 28:13.694
You do know why Mary didn't get
this story done in 2000, don't you?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.236
Uh-uh.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.838
Mary's mother died...

28:22.034 --> 28:24.139
right in the middle of it.

28:24.736 --> 28:28.548
And then the story never got finished
and the election happened.

28:28.740 --> 28:33.246
An election that was decided
by 537 votes.

28:33.912 --> 28:34.982
I think...

28:35.747 --> 28:38.694
that if Mary's mother
hadn't died that summer...

28:38.884 --> 28:42.730
there's a real good chance that
Al Gore would be president right now.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.902
And what about her father?

28:52.231 --> 28:55.075
Mary's father
is a drunken piece of shit...

28:55.267 --> 28:58.441
who hated himself so much,
he beat his own daughters.

29:00.239 --> 29:04.187
The more outspoken they were,
she <i>says,</i> the harder he hit them.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.289
- So how do you think she fared?
- She would get beat up...

29:07.512 --> 29:10.755
- for asking questions?
- That's right.

29:11.617 --> 29:14.564
And this is what she does for a living?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.360
People are funny sometimes.

29:19.057 --> 29:22.527
It's part of what's between her and Dan,
I think.

29:22.728 --> 29:25.265
Why they work so well together.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.544
It's why they need each other.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.481
Fathers and daughters.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.764
Whatever <i>it</i> takes.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.163
Tell me about the document examiners.

29:53.392 --> 29:57.397
There are four. Marcel Matley is coming
from San Francisco to do on-camera.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.099
Linda James in Texas
wants to see the originals.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.404
- Yeah, we don't have them.
- I told her.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.081
Jim Pierce in Los Angeles
just started today...

30:05.270 --> 30:08.274
and Emily Will in North Carolina
wants you to call her.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.611
Right. Got it.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.977
<i>I mink you have a problem.</i>

30:12.177 --> 30:14.282
I've been doing Internet research.

30:14.479 --> 30:18.325
President was in Alabama when
these were written, they can't be true.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.953
Okay. Have you found anything wrong
with the documents themselves?

30:22.154 --> 30:25.863
- Well, no, but...
- Do they appear forged in any way?

30:26.091 --> 30:28.128
- Without the originals...
- That's <i>okay.</i>

30:28.327 --> 30:30.933
You just let me worry
about the investigational side.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.966
I always work the whole thing.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.309
Look, do you know
where these originated?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.880
<i>Establishing chain of custody
would go</i> a <i>long</i> way...

30:40.038 --> 30:42.018
<i>"inward determining authenticity."</i>

30:42.207 --> 30:44.448
Yeah, believe me, we're working on it.

30:44.643 --> 30:48.455
I give you the memos, you verify them,
that was the deal.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.490
You call the Kerry campaign
for me yet?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.787
<i>They cannot lie down
on this Swift Boat shit.</i>

30:52.984 --> 30:58.491
If you could just confirm where you got
the memos from, we would be home free.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.534
- I told you I cannot go on the record.
- I <i>know.</i>

31:01.727 --> 31:04.139
I know. You wouldn't have to.

31:04.363 --> 31:08.004
You just give me the name.
All right? That's all I need.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.543
George Conn.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.014
<i>- Buddy of mine in the Guard.
- Right.</i>

31:15.207 --> 31:18.518
<i>He was there for the scrubbing.
But you call him, he will deny it.</i>

31:18.710 --> 31:21.816
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.061
<i>You have reached the Conn residence.</i>

31:31.223 --> 31:32.224
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

31:33.759 --> 31:36.171
Colonel, this is Mary Mapes
with 60 Minutes.

31:36.361 --> 31:39.205
Was wondering if you could give me
a call at your convenience.

31:39.398 --> 31:43.869
It's regarding a story we're airing
on Wednesday night. Thank you.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.605
- Matley's here.
- Yeah.

31:45.837 --> 31:49.375
I would say, based on
our available handwriting evidence...

31:49.574 --> 31:51.952
yes, this is the same person.

31:52.110 --> 31:57.389
This signature on the June 24th document
shows some conspicuous differences.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.889
But it also shows
some inconspicuous...

32:01.086 --> 32:03.464
similarities
to Colonel Killian's handwriting.

32:03.688 --> 32:06.225
Right, and why might
differences like this exist?

32:06.425 --> 32:09.065
The content of the memo
is highly stressful...

32:09.261 --> 32:13.539
Killian telling a higher-up that he
cannot rate Bush during his absence.

32:13.732 --> 32:18.147
This is enough to explain differences
in the pen strokes.

32:21.306 --> 32:23.582
Would you excuse me a moment?

32:26.978 --> 32:29.618
It's like watching
paint dry. What am I gonna do?

32:29.815 --> 32:32.819
That was in there
somewhere. Think you can get the bite?

32:33.051 --> 32:36.225
- Did I have lint on my jacket?
- Two bottles of whiskey.

32:36.421 --> 32:37.729
Okay.

32:41.726 --> 32:43.797
So, sir, are you saying...

32:43.962 --> 32:46.408
that if I present this
to the American public...

32:46.598 --> 32:48.805
and say that to the best
of our knowledge...

32:49.000 --> 32:53.574
these documents are all signed
by the same man, am I on solid ground?

32:56.341 --> 32:57.479
Yes.

32:57.676 --> 33:01.123
Matley's a yes. Jim Pierce is a yes.
Emily Will's still working.

33:01.279 --> 33:04.158
Linda James wants more documents,
but she'll defer to Matley.

33:04.349 --> 33:07.626
Dates, contents of the Burkett memos
mesh with the official record.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.427
And I'm having Graphics
mock something up to show it visually.

33:11.623 --> 33:12.931
We don't have it yet.

33:13.525 --> 33:16.938
Somebody has got to confirm
the content of those memos.

33:17.128 --> 33:18.801
Somebody who knew the players.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.977
No one in the Guard is gonna step up.

33:21.132 --> 33:24.807
Look what happened to Burkett. You talk,
you get your head handed to you.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.607
Who were Killian's commanders?

33:26.805 --> 33:30.981
There's Buck Staudt, who figuratively
and literally told me to go fuck myself...

33:31.176 --> 33:33.986
and Bobby Hodges,
who I've left 18 messages for.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.227
Fine, I'll do 19.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.238
You guys feel like pizza?

33:52.664 --> 33:56.737
I really feel like we should
start thinking about pizza.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.648
<i>Hello?</i>

34:08.179 --> 34:11.217
- General Hodges?
- Yeah.

34:11.516 --> 34:12.516
Uh...

34:12.717 --> 34:16.027
This is Mary Mapes with 60 Minutes.

34:16.321 --> 34:19.996
I'd like to speak with you
about some old memos...

34:20.190 --> 34:24.900
I've come across from the 187th
Fighter Interceptor Squadron.

34:26.231 --> 34:29.178
They, uh, appear to...

34:29.367 --> 34:33.371
from the personal files
of Jerry Killian.

34:35.172 --> 34:38.949
Well, I'd like to read them to you,
if that's okay'!

34:39.177 --> 34:40.918
<i>All right.</i>

34:41.846 --> 34:48.525
Okay. Uh, the first one
is dated June 24, 1973.

34:48.719 --> 34:53.260
And the subject is Bush, George W.,
first lieutenant.

34:53.458 --> 34:57.929
"Sir. I got a call from your staff
concerning the evaluation..."

34:58.129 --> 35:00.575
of First Lieutenant Bush
due this month.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.974
His rater is Lieutenant Colonel Harris.

35:04.202 --> 35:08.617
Neither Lieutenant Colonel Harris or I
feel we can rate First Lieutenant Bush...

35:08.807 --> 35:13.278
since he was not training
with the 111th FIS since April 1972.

35:13.478 --> 35:17.949
His recent activity
is outside the rating period.

35:18.216 --> 35:21.925
"Advise me how we
are supposed to handle this."

35:25.457 --> 35:28.097
Okay, um, the...

35:28.293 --> 35:34.244
This one is August 18, 1973
and the subject titled CYA...

35:34.432 --> 35:37.436
which I believe means
"cover your ass"?

35:38.570 --> 35:43.679
Okay. "Staudt has obviously pressured
Hodges more about Bush."

35:43.908 --> 35:46.912
I'm having trouble running interference
and doing my job.

35:47.112 --> 35:51.618
Harris gave me a message today
from Group regarding Bush's OETR...

35:51.816 --> 35:54.160
and Staudt is pushing
to sugarcoat it.

35:54.352 --> 35:57.299
Bush wasn't here
during rating period...

35:57.489 --> 36:00.368
and I don't have any feedback
from 187th in Alabama.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.594
I will not rate.

36:02.794 --> 36:06.264
Austin is not happy today either.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.944
Harris took the call from Group today.

36:09.134 --> 36:12.513
I'll backdate but won't rate.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.116
"Harris agrees."

36:17.308 --> 36:22.519
Sir, are these memos familiar to you?

36:23.515 --> 36:24.516
<i>They are.</i>

36:26.384 --> 36:31.129
<i>But using someone's personal notes,
that's going overboard.</i>

36:31.322 --> 36:35.168
<i>You're trying 10 make news, create
a story here where there ism one.</i>

36:35.360 --> 36:39.206
No, sir,
we're not trying to create anything.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.006
Hold on a minute. Hold.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.480
We have it.

36:47.405 --> 36:48.975
Tell me the truth...

36:49.140 --> 36:51.484
and the whole truth
about what happened...

36:51.643 --> 36:55.056
with George W. Bush
and the draft and the National Guard.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.694
Sid Adger, a friend of the Bush family,
came to see me...

37:01.886 --> 37:05.265
and he asked me
if I would recommend...

37:05.490 --> 37:08.528
George W. Bush
for the Air National Guard.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.400
And I did.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.538
I'm concerned about
the sheer amount of story we have.

37:13.732 --> 37:17.236
You know, what if we split it?
You know, run Barnes tomorrow...

37:17.435 --> 37:19.779
and the documents
on the Sunday broadcast.

37:20.004 --> 37:23.952
Sunday's show won't give us the real
estate. Where are we with the rest of it?

37:24.275 --> 37:26.619
Well, I just got an e-mail
from Emily Will.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.121
She has some concerns
about the superscript thing.

37:29.347 --> 37:31.918
Superscript?
It's the raised "th" after the 111.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.929
She was worried that function wasn't available
on military typewriters in the '70s.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.034
But I spoke to Matley,
he said they were available then...

37:39.224 --> 37:41.363
so Emily said she'd defer to him.

37:41.559 --> 37:42.697
Good, all right.

37:42.894 --> 37:46.068
Uh, White House will have someone
for on-camera in the morning.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.473
I can't send Dan
because of the storm.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.580
That fucking hurricane hates me.

37:52.771 --> 37:56.617
Well, I don't think that I had the right...

37:56.808 --> 37:59.379
to have the power that I had.

37:59.577 --> 38:04.253
To choose who was gonna go to Vietnam
and who was not gonna go to Vietnam.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.953
That's a power in some instances
when I look at those names...

38:08.153 --> 38:12.329
of maybe determining life or death,
and that's not a power I wanna have.

38:12.657 --> 38:17.265
Too strong or not,
to say you're ashamed of it now?

38:17.462 --> 38:22.411
Oh, I think that that would be
an appropriate thing.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.577
<i>I'm very, very sorry.</i>

38:31.943 --> 38:32.978
What's it running?

38:33.178 --> 38:36.591
It's 60 minutes, at least three over.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.819
Some of the document stuffs a little slow,
you can trim there.

38:40.018 --> 38:43.488
How about flipping it, open with Barnes,
then do the documents?

38:43.688 --> 38:45.258
Keep it chronological.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.493
- Mmhm.
- You've got three hours.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.672
Right.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.273
<i>Now, this
signature, on the June 24th document...</i>

38:52.463 --> 38:54.602
<i>shows some
conspicuous differences.</i>

38:54.799 --> 38:57.370
<i>But it also shows
some inconspicuous...</i>

38:57.602 --> 38:59.639
No. Go back. It's still too long.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.183
- Go back to the bit where he's...
- You've gotta lose Matley.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.684
We're 40 seconds over,
and he's a shit interview.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.448
The meshing graphic doesn't work.

39:07.645 --> 39:11.320
It shows where the new documents fall in
with the originals. If we lose that...

39:11.516 --> 39:14.019
Poorly. Look, we're out of time.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.699
It's your call. What do you wanna do?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.894
Cut it.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.044
- We need to output in two minutes.
- I know.

39:34.906 --> 39:38.149
If we don't start outputting,
we're not gonna have a show.

39:39.844 --> 39:43.087
- Lock it and start outputting.
- If there's a computer hiccup...

39:43.314 --> 39:46.557
- Tom, I worship you, but shut the fuck up.
- Heh. Okay. All right.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.556
<i>Eighteen new castaways...</i>

39:49.721 --> 39:51.401
<i>will face their toughest challenge yet.</i>

39:51.589 --> 39:56.197
Vanuatu premieres Thursday
at 8, <i>7</i> Central. <i>Only</i> on CBS.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.840
<i>Somebody's gonna get burned.</i>

40:03.735 --> 40:06.909
<i>The military records of the two men
running for president...</i>

40:07.105 --> 40:10.382
<i>have become pan'
of the political arsenal in this campaign.</i>

40:10.575 --> 40:13.112
<i>A tool for building up or blowing</i> up...

40:13.344 --> 40:17.952
<i>each candidate's credibility
as America's next commander-in-chief.</i>

40:18.182 --> 40:22.187
<i>While Senator Kerry has been targeted
for what he did in combat in Vietnam...</i>

40:22.387 --> 40:25.800
<i>President Bush has been criticized
for avoiding Vietnam...</i>

40:26.024 --> 40:30.268
by <i>landing</i> a <i>much sought-after spot
in the Texas Air National Guard...</i>

40:30.595 --> 40:35.943
<i>and then, apparently, failing to meet
some of his obligations in the Guard.</i>

40:36.134 --> 40:40.446
<i>Did then Lieutenant Bush
fulfill all his military commitments?</i>

40:40.638 --> 40:44.780
<i>And just how did he land that coveted
slot in the Guard in the first place?</i>

40:44.976 --> 40:47.081
<i>Tonight, we have new documents...</i>

40:47.278 --> 40:50.487
<i>and new information
on the presidents military service.</i>

40:51.282 --> 40:53.489
<i>And the first interview
with the man who says...</i>

40:53.718 --> 40:56.392
<i>he pulled the strings
to get young George W. Bush...</i>

40:56.587 --> 40:58.260
<i>into the Texas Air National Guard.</i>

42:20.738 --> 42:24.049
<i>The president's time
in the National Guard reemerged today.</i>

42:24.242 --> 42:27.485
<i>He enlisted in Texas,
transferred is Alabama...</i>

42:27.678 --> 42:31.558
- and got out <i>early</i> to attend...
- This is what our business has become.

42:31.749 --> 42:35.754
Reporting on reporting. I mean,
why go to the trouble of breaking news...

42:35.987 --> 42:40.663
when all you have to do is just talk
about other people breaking news, huh?

42:41.192 --> 42:44.173
Thirty minutes from now, someone
somewhere is gonna be doing...

42:44.362 --> 42:48.674
a story about this guy
doing a story about us.

42:48.833 --> 42:50.634
You know what?
They're all gonna get Peabodys.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.943
This one mattered.

42:56.441 --> 42:59.217
It was great. Even the kid liked it.

42:59.410 --> 43:00.684
Oh, really?

43:00.878 --> 43:03.358
<i>Yeah. Yeah, you're</i> a <i>hell
of</i> a <i>reporter, babe.</i>

43:05.416 --> 43:07.623
All right, well, I'll be home tomorrow.

43:07.852 --> 43:09.297
Okay, ï¬‚y safe.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.260
- All right, I love you.
- Bye.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.800
- Hey, Mary?
- Mm-hm?

43:50.962 --> 43:53.568
Um, what's going on? Because these...

43:53.764 --> 43:58.076
These blogs are saying the memos can
be re-created exactly in Microsoft Word.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.777
- Who's saying this?
- Well, it's a conservative website, but...

44:03.841 --> 44:06.947
"Every one of these memos
is in proportionally spaced font."

44:07.145 --> 44:09.318
It's probably Palatino
or Times New Roman.

44:09.914 --> 44:12.758
In 1972, typewriters
used monospaced fonts.

44:12.917 --> 44:15.363
Proportionally spaced fonts
did not come into use...

44:15.586 --> 44:18.430
until the introduction
of personal computers.

44:18.623 --> 44:21.126
They were not widespread
until the '90s. Before then...

44:21.292 --> 44:25.934
you needed typesetting equipment.
That wasn't used for personal memos.

44:26.264 --> 44:28.767
I'm saying these documents
are forgeries...

44:28.966 --> 44:32.846
run through a copier
for 15 generations...

44:33.137 --> 44:35.640
"to make them look old."

44:38.609 --> 44:39.644
Okay.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.496
Mary?

44:51.155 --> 44:53.396
What the hell is going on?

44:54.058 --> 44:57.699
"Spacing is not just similar,
it is identical in every respect."

44:57.862 --> 45:01.674
Notice that the date lines up perfectly,
the line breaks are in the same places...

45:01.866 --> 45:06.337
all letters line up
with the same letters above and below.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.642
And the kerning is exactly the same.

45:08.839 --> 45:12.082
And I did not change a single thing
from Word's defaults.

45:12.310 --> 45:18.920
"Margins, type size, tab stops, etcetera,
are all using the default settings."

45:20.351 --> 45:22.661
What the hell are we gonna do?

45:23.754 --> 45:25.256
Due respect, did you fuck up?

45:25.423 --> 45:30.031
We had four document examiners
and not one said the memos weren't real.

45:30.361 --> 45:32.739
Did any of them try typing them
into Microsoft Word?

45:32.897 --> 45:35.070
I don't know,
I'm not a document examiner.

45:35.266 --> 45:39.373
But I'm assuming their job is to make
sure these things weren't whipped up.

45:39.570 --> 45:43.916
- Just because guys on the Internet...
- It's not just the guys on the Internet.

45:44.108 --> 45:45.712
ABC News is going after this.

45:45.910 --> 45:48.254
- Nightline.
- You mean they're going after Dan?

45:48.446 --> 45:49.447
Yes.

45:49.614 --> 45:50.894
Tell them about the superscript.

45:51.082 --> 45:53.722
It's the "th" that pops up
after you type a number.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.956
- Like 111th.
- Yeah. I know what it is. What about it?

45:57.188 --> 46:00.533
Bloggers are saying it's a big red flag
this was done on a computer.

46:00.725 --> 46:03.638
They say it didn't exist
on typewriters in the 1970s.

46:03.794 --> 46:05.314
- Well...
- One of the examiners...

46:05.429 --> 46:07.602
did raise that concern as well.

46:08.065 --> 46:09.408
Emily Will.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.979
Yeah, but Matley said they did
have them, and she deferred to him.

46:13.204 --> 46:15.377
They will kill us on that alone.

46:15.573 --> 46:19.612
- I don't understand, what do they want?
- They want us to say we're wrong.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.153
Because if we're wrong...

46:21.379 --> 46:25.259
all the questions we've asked
about the president's service go away.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.722
Look. Okay.

46:27.885 --> 46:30.126
We have the document examiners,
okay?

46:30.321 --> 46:32.892
Bob Strong,
who worked at Guard headquarters...

46:33.090 --> 46:36.469
says the memos are written
in the vernacular of the Guard at the time.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.836
And we have Bobby Hodges,
Killian's commanding officer...

46:39.997 --> 46:41.670
who confirmed both the content...

46:41.899 --> 46:44.778
and that they reï¬‚ected
Killian's state of mind at the time.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.573
We have this story.

46:46.771 --> 46:48.079
Well, make sure.

46:48.406 --> 46:49.908
Reconfirm with everybody.

46:50.107 --> 46:54.146
And find us another goddamn "th"
in the official record.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.996
We need to find that "th."

47:08.959 --> 47:11.496
- Hi.
- Yo.

47:14.298 --> 47:17.438
- You heard?
- Yeah, yeah. It's bullshit.

47:17.635 --> 47:19.308
Pardon my French.

47:19.503 --> 47:23.280
People have attacked me for 30 years,
it's not about to start bothering me now.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.010
Now, are you okay?

47:25.943 --> 47:27.980
We're gonna be in a fight here, Dan.

47:28.179 --> 47:32.855
- I still got a few good ones left in me.
- Did you get your contract sewn up yet?

47:33.050 --> 47:36.361
I got the head of the news division
his job, I'm gonna be fine.

47:36.721 --> 47:38.860
You gonna give me something
to hit back with?

47:39.390 --> 47:40.960
Yes, sir.

47:41.625 --> 47:45.835
<i>The blast went off at 10:30 local time
at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta...</i>

47:46.030 --> 47:49.011
<i>killing nine people
and wounding 180.</i>

47:49.200 --> 47:52.340
<i>Jemaah Islamiah,
the Southeast Asian terrorist group...</i>

47:52.536 --> 47:54.709

47:54.905 --> 47:57.886
<i>"but several document
experts contacted by ABC News..."</i>

47:58.075 --> 48:02.251
<i>have raised serious questions about
the authenticity of these new documents.</i>

48:02.480 --> 48:06.724
<i>They point to the typeface, spacing and
perfectly even imprint of the letters...</i>

48:06.917 --> 48:11.093
<i>that look more like the creation
of</i> a <i>computer than</i> a <i>typewriter.</i>

48:11.322 --> 48:14.235
<i>And there's this,
the little superscript â€œth. â€œ.</i>

48:14.425 --> 48:17.736
<i>That's something very few typewriters
could do in 1972.</i>

48:19.263 --> 48:21.209
<i>You have
reached the Hodges' residence.</i>

48:21.365 --> 48:22.571
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

48:24.001 --> 48:25.036
General Hodges...

48:25.236 --> 48:29.241
<i>this is Mary Mapes. We need
to get in touch again. Can you call me?</i>

48:29.440 --> 48:30.942
Thank you.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.950
<i>Avoid Vietnam has followed him...</i>

48:39.116 --> 48:41.027
<i>since he ran for governor of Texas...</i>

48:41.218 --> 48:42.754
<i>wand Mr. Bush has always denied it.</i>

48:42.920 --> 48:46.026
<i>I enjoyed it and I enjoyed my service...</i>

48:48.025 --> 48:49.629
Nothing.

48:53.030 --> 48:54.202
You done with these?

48:54.365 --> 48:55.969
- Never were mine.
- Okay.

48:57.201 --> 49:00.444
<i>That he was</i> a <i>person who did n...</i>

49:00.604 --> 49:02.743
Staudt was already out of the Guard.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.219
What are you talking about?

49:05.409 --> 49:09.050
The CYA memo,
dated August 18, 1973.

49:09.246 --> 49:14.889
"Staudt has obviously
pressured Hodges more about Bush."

49:15.219 --> 49:17.665
Staudt left the Guard in 1972.

49:17.888 --> 49:20.095
So how the fuck
can he still be pressuring?

49:21.826 --> 49:24.773
Listen, when a commanding officer...

49:24.962 --> 49:29.274
- No, the bloggers are having a field day.
- When a general leaves his posting...

49:29.467 --> 49:32.277
and goes to work for Quantico
on the same base...

49:32.470 --> 49:36.577
he still wields an enormous amount of
influence. It doesn't matter when he left.

49:36.774 --> 49:38.776
- Back me up, Roger.
- She's right.

49:39.410 --> 49:41.947
Yeah. Right, well, uh...

49:42.413 --> 49:46.259
Forgive me if I don't think everyone
is gonna see it the same way you do.

49:56.827 --> 49:57.862
This is bad.

50:00.698 --> 50:05.545
No, when they start asking
to talk to our source...

50:05.769 --> 50:07.680
then it'll be bad.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.842
They're coming for us, Roger.

50:32.329 --> 50:33.899
Mm...

50:40.304 --> 50:42.011
I've got one.

50:42.206 --> 50:43.810
What?

50:44.008 --> 50:49.082
I have a superscript "th" here.
Ha-ha-ha.

50:49.313 --> 50:51.190
Josh!

50:54.351 --> 50:57.161
Call Dan,
tell him we just got in the fight.

50:57.354 --> 50:58.924
<i>So can the experts say...</i>

50:59.089 --> 51:01.399
<i>George,
positively that these weren't typed...</i>

51:01.592 --> 51:04.072
<i>and couldn't have been made
in the early '70s?</i>

51:04.228 --> 51:07.004
<i>They say all the
clues indicate that. They're not making...</i>

51:07.197 --> 51:11.441
<i>an absolute 100 percent guarantee,
and CBS is still standing by its story.</i>

51:11.602 --> 51:14.742
<i>And in fact, they're also
pointing to another source...</i>

51:14.939 --> 51:16.612
a Colonel Robert Hodges...

51:16.840 --> 51:19.411
<i>â€œwho was an immediate superior
of Mr. Killian,.</i>

51:19.610 --> 51:22.557
<i>They say they read these documents
to Colonel Hodges.</i>

51:22.746 --> 51:25.920
<i>He said, "Sounds like what Killian
was telling me at the time."</i>

51:26.116 --> 51:27.857
<i>Hodges is not speaking to anyone yet.</i>

51:28.018 --> 51:31.431
Because we can't get him
on the fucking phone!

51:32.256 --> 51:34.896
Those raising questions
about the documents...

51:35.092 --> 51:37.936
have focused on something
called superscript.

51:38.128 --> 51:41.735
A key that automatically types
a raised "th."

51:41.932 --> 51:47.075
Critics claim typewriters didn't have
that ability in the 1970s, but some did.

51:47.738 --> 51:51.652
In fact, other Bush military records
released by the White House itself...

51:51.875 --> 51:53.821
show the same superscript.

51:54.044 --> 51:56.957
Here's one from 1968.

51:57.448 --> 51:58.791
Some analysts outside CBS...

51:58.949 --> 52:02.829
say they believe the typeface
on these memos is New Times Roman...

52:03.053 --> 52:05.966
which they claim was not available
in the 1970s.

52:06.156 --> 52:09.569
But the owner of the company
that distributes this typing style...

52:09.760 --> 52:12.502
says it has been available since 1931.

52:12.730 --> 52:15.836
Document and handwriting examiner
Marcel Matley...

52:16.066 --> 52:18.603
analyzed the documents
for CBS News.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.645
He says he believes they are real...

52:20.838 --> 52:24.342
but is concerned about
exactly what is being examined...

52:24.575 --> 52:27.613
by some of the people
now questioning the documents.

52:27.811 --> 52:31.452
Because deterioration occurs
each time a document is reproduced.

52:31.649 --> 52:35.791
And the documents being analyzed
outside of CBS had been photocopied...

52:35.986 --> 52:38.125
faxed, scanned and downloaded...

52:38.322 --> 52:42.099
and are far removed
from the documents CBS started with.

52:42.292 --> 52:46.365
Matley did this interview with us
prior to Wednesday's broadcast.

52:46.597 --> 52:50.943
<i>We look basically at what's called
significant or insignificant features...</i>

52:51.135 --> 52:54.139
<i>to determine
whether it's the same person or not.</i>

52:54.338 --> 52:57.285
<i>So I have no problem identifying them.</i>

52:57.474 --> 53:00.785
<i>I would say based on our available
handwriting evidence...</i>

53:00.978 --> 53:03.982
<i>yes, this is the same person.</i>

53:04.181 --> 53:08.152
Matley finds the signatures to be
some of the most compelling evidence.

53:08.352 --> 53:11.026
We talked to him again today
by satellite.

53:12.122 --> 53:16.468
Are you surprised questions come about
these? We're not, but are you surprised?

53:17.194 --> 53:21.506
<i>I knew going in this was dynamite,
one way or the other,.</i>

53:21.699 --> 53:27.047
<i>And I knew that potentially this could do
far more damage to me professionally...</i>

53:27.237 --> 53:28.875
<i>than benefit me.</i>

53:29.073 --> 53:31.314
<i>And... And I knew that.</i>

53:31.508 --> 53:35.513
<i>But... But we seek the truth.
That's what we do.</i>

53:35.979 --> 53:39.017
<i>You're supposed to put yourself out,
seek the truth...</i>

53:39.216 --> 53:41.560
<i>and take what comes from it.</i>

53:42.252 --> 53:44.232
<i>Fax he CBS Evening News...</i>

53:44.421 --> 53:45.991
Dan Rather reporting.

53:46.190 --> 53:47.669
Good night.

53:48.025 --> 53:50.198
And we're clear.

53:54.598 --> 53:57.738
- I told you I had it in me.
- I'm calling Andrew right now.

53:57.935 --> 53:59.846
- F.E.A.
- No kidding.

54:00.037 --> 54:02.347
- What'd you think?
- I think you parked it.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.614
Bobby Hodges is on the phone.

54:08.879 --> 54:12.918
General Hodges? This is Mary Mapes.
I've got Dan Rather on the line with me.

54:13.117 --> 54:14.596
Why <i>is</i> The Washington Post...

54:14.752 --> 54:16.732
<i>describing me
as your trump card in this?</i>

54:17.521 --> 54:19.023
<i>Did you tell them that, Dan?</i>

54:19.223 --> 54:20.725
I did not, sir.

54:20.924 --> 54:25.270
<i>It says</i> a <i>highly placed CBS source
referred to me as your trump card.</i>

54:25.462 --> 54:28.705
Well, sir, that was not me
and it was not Dan.

54:28.899 --> 54:32.369
<i>Well, good, because I'm not.
I've seen all the coverage.</i>

54:32.569 --> 54:35.778
<i>And I have to say
I think these memos are fake.</i>

54:36.306 --> 54:37.717
You...? Excuse me?

54:37.908 --> 54:40.548
<i>I do not believe Jerry Killian
wrote those memos.</i>

54:40.744 --> 54:42.417
Sir, when we spoke on...

54:43.714 --> 54:46.820
September 6th... I'm sorry,
I'm just going through my notes.

54:47.050 --> 54:50.896
When we spoke, you said the content
of the memos was familiar to you.

54:51.054 --> 54:52.590
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

54:52.790 --> 54:56.670
And that they reflected
Colonel Killian's mind-set at the time.

54:56.894 --> 54:58.396
<i>And they do.</i>

54:58.796 --> 55:01.902
<i>Bu! I hadn't physically seen them.</i>

55:02.666 --> 55:06.614
So, what physically about the memos
makes you now doubt their authenticity?

55:06.804 --> 55:09.580
<i>Jerry's family says
he didn't write them.</i>

55:09.740 --> 55:10.775
Uh...

55:10.941 --> 55:13.751
General, the thrust of our story
was about what happened...

55:13.911 --> 55:17.620
with the president's Guard service.
Now, if as you say...

55:17.815 --> 55:20.261
Colonel Killian really did feel
this way...

55:20.450 --> 55:24.262
and the things described
in the memos are true...

55:24.421 --> 55:26.298
we'd like to talk to you about that.

55:26.490 --> 55:29.767
<i>I'm just telling you
I now believe the memos are forgeries.</i>

55:29.960 --> 55:31.633
Forget the memos, sir.

55:31.829 --> 55:36.778
Is what we presented
about President Bush accurate?

55:38.769 --> 55:42.444
<i>- I don't wanna get in the middle of this.</i>
- Get <i>him to go</i> on <i>camera.</i>

55:43.340 --> 55:46.617
Would you be willing if I came to see you
to talk to me on camera?

55:46.810 --> 55:47.880
<i>No, Dan, I'm sorry.</i>

55:48.111 --> 55:50.318
<i>Maybe after the election.</i>

55:50.514 --> 55:53.154
<i>- General, if</i> you...
<i>- Look, the family says they're fake.</i>

55:53.350 --> 55:56.820
<i>And I'm supporting the family, okay?
I'm sorry.</i>

55:59.690 --> 56:01.636
Shit!

56:01.825 --> 56:04.533
All right, what are we doing
about Hodges recanting?

56:04.728 --> 56:06.571
We say we respect General Hodges...

56:06.797 --> 56:09.403
and believed him the first time
we spoke with him.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.140
Uh, ABC is reaching out
to two of our examiners.

56:13.337 --> 56:17.217
Emily Will and Linda James. They say
they never authenticated the memos.

56:17.741 --> 56:18.981
Of course they didn't.

56:19.176 --> 56:20.712
- Why?
- They...

56:20.911 --> 56:22.254
They... They couldn't.

56:25.182 --> 56:28.391
Well, because they're copies.

56:28.585 --> 56:31.896
There's no original ink or paper
to, you know, test.

56:32.089 --> 56:35.366
No one can say with 100 percent
certainty they're real or forgeries.

56:35.525 --> 56:37.098
That's why they can attack us.

56:37.124 --> 56:39.692
Except on the Internet,
they are certain...

56:39.863 --> 56:43.037
- Those are lousy wannabe analysts.
- We get lousy analysts of our own.

56:43.233 --> 56:46.578
Our story was about whether Bush's
connections got him into the Guard...

56:46.737 --> 56:49.047
and covered for him
when he missed commitments.

56:49.206 --> 56:50.879
Research we found backs that up.

56:51.074 --> 56:54.715
The documents, they were a small part.
They were not the point of the story.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.791
It doesn't matter what the point
of the story was. We have to...

56:57.948 --> 57:00.019
- They do not get to do this.
- Do what?

57:00.217 --> 57:04.597
They do not get to smack us
just for asking a fucking question.

57:14.898 --> 57:16.878
Monday morning...

57:18.135 --> 57:20.581
I want analysts backing us up.

57:21.738 --> 57:23.046
Let's go.

59:04.975 --> 59:06.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

59:07.911 --> 59:09.219
When did you get in?

59:09.413 --> 59:12.123
I was worried there might
be cameras at the airport.

59:12.149 --> 59:13.784
Didn't want Robbie to see that.

59:14.151 --> 59:15.824
God, what are you doing in here?

59:16.553 --> 59:19.329
- Working.
- Why don't you take a break?

59:19.523 --> 59:21.662
I'll go get dressed,
we can take a walk.

59:21.858 --> 59:25.897
No, I don't need to take a fucking walk.
I wanna sit here and do this, okay?

59:27.731 --> 59:30.575
This... Okay.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.527
I'm sorry.

59:51.855 --> 59:55.064
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

59:55.258 --> 59:59.468
It's just-No matter what I say,
no matter what I do, I'm gonna get hit.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.369
This...

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.745
This is not that.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:13.714
When my dad would start in on me,
I would think:

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.549
"I am not gonna cry."

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.657
I am not gonna ask him to stop.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:22.056
"I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction
of seeing how much it hurts."

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.823
And he would just go in harder.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:28.730
And I would think,
"Someday, I am gonna fight you."

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.333
And I never did.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.508
Now.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.911
You have to fight now.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.751
<i>Everything that's in those documents
that people are saying can't be done...</i>

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:55.361
<i>as you said, 32 years ago,
is just totally false.</i>

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:59.192
<i>Not true. Like I said,
proportional spacing was available.</i>

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:02.426
<i>Superscripts was available
as a custom feature.</i>

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:06.506
Go back to the beginning of the list.
I think that's useful, don't you, Roger?

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.007
Word's come down from Andrew.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.941
They wanna talk to your source.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:15.483
Well, what if my source
doesn't wanna talk to them?

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.151
Then you'll convince him.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.947
You're good at convincing people
to do things, aren't you, Mary'?

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.851
I just want you to know how important
your support has been...

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.621
throughout this entire process.

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.560
Call your fucking source, Mary.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.030
Now...

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:38.900
it's bad.

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:41.370
- You said he wouldn't have to.
- I know, just...

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.910
You'd verify the documents
and he wouldn't have to do anything else.

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.911
Well, it didn't work out that way, did it?

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:52.344
Oh, I'm sorry, Nicki. I'm just...
I'm ti... I'm just tired.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.014
Bill did nothing wrong.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.589
No one's saying he did.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:59.487
I just need to get him on the phone
with my boss...

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:01.356
and tell him what he told me.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.829
It would mean a lotto Dan.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.906
Would you, please?

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:18.609
Bill, this is Andrew Heyward,
I'm the president of CBS News.

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.475
Is Dan there?

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:22.741
I'm here, colonel.

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:25.283
<i>Well, I heard Hodges
turned tail on you. Heh.</i>

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.954
<i>All these guys run from it.</i>

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.954
<i>You know I got health problems.</i>

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:35.196
I had heard that, which is why I don't
<i>wanna</i> take up too much of your time.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:38.298
I was wondering if you could fill me in
on a few things.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.556
<i>Shoot.</i>

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.430
Well, how you came to be in possession
of the documents.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.232
You told Mary it was from a man
named George Conn?

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:49.308
<i>Well, she was bugging me so much
about it, I had to tell her something.</i>

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.712
So that's not accurate?

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:57.112
- No, sir, it <i>is not.</i>
- Fucking...

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:00.311
Would you mind telling us
what really happened?

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.386
<i>"I got a sail in March from a guy."...</i>

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:04.820
who said a <i>woman</i>
named Lucy Ramirez...

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:06.959
<i>wanted to get in contact with me.</i>

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:10.791
<i>He told me to call the Houston
Holiday Inn between 7 and 10...</i>

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:13.263
<i>wand ask for a specific...</i>

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.129
<i>so I did.</i>

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:18.397
<i>This woman told me
she was supposed to be</i> a <i>go-between...</i>

01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:22.065
<i>a person to deliver</i>
a <i>package of documents to me.</i>

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.836
<i>And I was supposed to copy
the documents...</i>

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:29.244
<i>and then burn the originals, which
were also copies, and the envelope.</i>

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.087
<i>- Bullshit.
- Destroy the DNA evidence...</i>

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.145
<i>of where they come from, you see?</i>

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:35.789
Yeah, of course.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.482
<i>"So she says," When are you gonna be
in Houston next?</i>

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:41.629
<i>I tell her, "We're coming to
the livestock show in a few weeks."</i>

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.692
<i>We sell Simmental cattle.</i>

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.527
<i>The show is en excellent way
to advertise our bull semen.</i>

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:51.669
<i>So the first day at the show,</i>
a <i>dark-skinned fella</i> comes <i>up...</i>

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:54.467
<i>mend hands me an envelope
and walks</i> away.

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.201
<i>Inside are those memos.</i>

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.476
<i>I burned the rest like he said,.</i>

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:00.841
<i>Done and done.</i>

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:06.882
And was this the same man
who talked to you on the phone?

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.320
<i>No idea, Maybe.</i>

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:14.655
And you didn't tell Mary
all this before because...

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:18.397
<i>Well, I-I said I'd keep it quiet.</i>

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:22.068
<i>Mary did a good job on this.
Don't judge her too harshly.</i>

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:23.635
Thanks, Bill.

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:28.131
Well, Bill, this is, uh...

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.705
This is pretty amazing stuff.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:35.911
I wonder if you'd be willing to come down
and sit and talk about it for us.

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:38.813
Help clear the air for everyone.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.921
<i>I don't know. What do you mink, Dan?</i>

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:46.988
I think they can't hit us any harder
than they already are, colonel.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:51.261
I'd go on the record and tell the truth.

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.230
Be done with it.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.102
<i>Okay.</i>

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.768
My office will make
the necessary arrangements.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.503
- Thank you for your time.
- Goodbye.

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.396
We need him on the air soon.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.423
Yep.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.294
Mary, will you hang back a sec?

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.440
With Burkett, there needs to be
a line of questioning about his motives.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:39.444
His political leanings, his views
on the president, why he lied.

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:42.776
People will cover how we cover this.
We need to inoculate ourselves.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.715
Thou shalt always
protect the company.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.382
I want Dan to survive this.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.954
Why wouldn't he survive this?

01:05:56.653 --> 01:06:01.398
If Dan feels like this
is corporate positioning, he won't do it.

01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:03.502
He won't for me.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.906
He will for you.

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.295
He's on oxygen, so...

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:22.253
Uhoh. The vultures are here.
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.991
Dan! Dan!

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.751
- Mary, comment?
- Excuse us, folks.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:27.986
Over here. Right here.

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.059
- Excuse us. Pardon me, ma'am.
- Dan, a comment, please.

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:32.427
Dan!

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:33.930
Excuse us. Dan!

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.933
You broadcasted those fake memos.
You feel duped?

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:40.137
Can you confirm the memos were typed
on a word processor?

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:43.335
How would you feel
about betraying the people?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.706
Mary!

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:47.938
Who the fuck are you people?

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:50.810
You know anybody?

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:54.854
Yeah, if you could just see if you can
stop it, okay? Just get them to pull it.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.853
- Colonel.
- Yeah. All right. Bye.

01:06:57.046 --> 01:07:00.050
- Where are the Burketts?
- Upstairs, getting ready.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.895
Dan?

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.189
We need to ask
why he lied to us, okay?

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.526
We need to make sure we get that.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.374
I just wanted to come say hello
before we get things going.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.069
Oh, thank you, Dan. I appreciate that.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.213
- How do you do, ma'am?
- Hello there.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:24.977
Now, look, these things are fairly easy.
We're just gonna sit and talk.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.346
.Okay-.Okay-

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:30.355
Now, I will ask you about why you misled
us. I don't want you to be surprised.

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.584
No, I was expecting that.

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:35.728
- I'm happy to set the record straight.
- Great.

01:07:35.919 --> 01:07:41.198
Now, if you need to stop, need a glass of
water or anything, that's just fine. Okay?

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.099
Okay, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get my war paint on.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.213
That's the worst part
of this job, makeup.

01:07:46.239 --> 01:07:46.764
Ha, ha.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.107
The sound's ready when you are.

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:52.542
It's gonna be fine, Nicki. Okay?

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.779
Unh. Yep. Unh.

01:07:58.007 --> 01:08:00.954
But you told us a different story.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.191
To protect the people
who gave me the documents.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.291
Did they ask you to do this?

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.621
They wanted me to burn everything.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:13.425
They didn't want people to know
that they were the source on this.

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:15.796
This man and this mystery woman.

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:19.700
That's right.
Can I please have some water?

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.876
Oh, of course.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.537
We need a better bite on this.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:30.149
So maybe instead of, "Did they ask you to
do this?" say, "Did they ask you to lie?"

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.118
Yeah.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.952
Yeah. Okay.

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:43.127
Ahem. Now, we're gonna go back
for a moment.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.389
Okay.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:50.066
This man and this mystery woman,
did they ask you to lie to us?

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:54.799
They didn't want me to say
how I got the documents.

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.636
I see.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:09:00.645
- I see. So that's why you misled us?
- Yes.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:05.115
Your producer was pushing me
to find out where I got the memos from.

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:12.425
I see.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.528
So then, that's why you lied to us?

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.629
Yes.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.424
And I know it caused some...

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.859
Some problems. Excuse me.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.012
- Whenever you're ready.
- Yeah.

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:05.705
Okay.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.913
You said you knew that
these memos would cause a problem?

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:15.020
I knew it did,
but I didn't know it at the time.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:18.852
I see. Now, again...

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:22.894
why didn't you tell us the truth
when you gave us those memos?

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:25.332
To protect people, Dan.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:31.263
People who were trying to tell the truth
about what really happened back then.

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:37.042
And do you believe those
documents are telling the truth?

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.838
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.876
I see. I see, So...

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:50.447
- We already have that.
- I need to make sure we...

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.956
No, we've got it. I'm moving on.

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:07.297
He's a good guy, you know.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:09.601
You think I enjoyed that?

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:12.906
We should cut something
for the news...

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.582
get it out immediately.
Andrew agrees.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.083
F.E.A.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:23.954
You know, you guys and Dan always
say that. What the hell does it mean?

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:26.583
It's open.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:36.230
Excuse me.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.329
How's Bill?

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:44.736
Oh, don't you dare ask how Bill is.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:48.849
Bill is sick. He's a sick man.
You don't give a damn about him.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:52.614
You just spent two hours
trying to destroy him.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.289
You made him crawl on camera.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:58.425
You made him say again and again
that he lied.

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:01.618
And that still wasn't enough for you.
You wanted more.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:04.492
You wanted to blame him
for all the things you did wrong...

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.292
putting this story together.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:09.936
You wanna wrap it in a neat package,
say "it's Bill Burkett's fault."

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:12.265
Well, it's not, and you know it.

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.498
You promised when
we came here to do this...

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:18.543
that we would get a fair shake,
and we got nothing from you but lies.

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:21.510
- Nicki...
- You may think I am some stupid hick...

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.945
who doesn't know a damn thing...

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.019
and you're so smart
and such a big shot.

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.553
But I keep my promises...

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:31.281
and I don't destroy people
to protect myself.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.984
I don't destroy people
and humiliate them...

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:39.455
and then pretend I give a goddamn
about how they are.

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:44.495
To answer your question,
Bill is not good.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.901
But then, you knew that already.

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:19.767
We need to talk.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.582
What are the chances you have
something alcoholic in there?

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.420
Better than average.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.921
How long have we known each other?

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.226
Oh, Jesus, is it that bad?

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:52.430
They're gonna start an investigation.

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:56.369
And CBS wants to appoint
an independent panel...

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:59.273
to take a look at how the story
was put together.

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.804
And I'm gonna announce it.

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.950
Tomorrow.

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:10.789
I'm gonna apologize for the story,
on air.

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.955
Andrew asked you to apologize?

01:14:16.419 --> 01:14:18.399
He didn't ask.

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:24.428
- Dan, that's... It's surrender.
- Ever since Burkett changed his story...

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.904
Andrew feels that CBS
cant afford the risk to its reputation...

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:29.440
Oh, God. He knew.

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:32.670
Even before we went down there.
Just wanted to get Burkett on tape.

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:34.678
Mary, you gotta promise
me something.

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:36.949
Stop worrying about me.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.846
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:41.351
You gotta protect yourself now.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.783
We all do.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:52.157
Thank you for the drink.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.609
<i>New, news about CBS News...</i>

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:10.147

documents we aired on this broadcast...</i>

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.684

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:26.289

CBS News and this reporter...</i>

01:15:26.489 --> 01:15:29.129

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:31.998
<i>Tonight, after further investigation...</i>

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.573

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.240
I'm sorry this was your first story here.

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:49.981
Well, I was thinking next week...

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:53.185
we just have Dan
shoot the president.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.658
Cause a lot less drama.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:05.069
Hey, uh... Hey, Mary, USA <i>Today</i> wants
to know if you put Burkett in touch...

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:08.242
with the Kerry campaign
in exchange for documents.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:14.771
I know what this is about. Josh,
do you remember when I told you...

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:19.043
Burkett wanted to give the Kerry
campaign advice on the Swift Boat stuff?

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.181
Remember, I wanted
to do a bullshit check...

01:16:22.378 --> 01:16:24.858
after he said he spoke
with Howard Dean.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:28.688
And you said that I could contact
the Kerry people to check.

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:31.387
Then Burkett wanted me
to give him his phone number...

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.760
and you said I could, so...

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:36.869
So... So I did. Do you...

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:38.733
Do you not remember any of this?

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:42.074
I must not have been clear.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:46.076
You must have misunderstood
what it was you could do.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.908
Oh, Jesus Christ, this is, uh...

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.612
This is unbelievable. I mean,
what the fuck else is gonna happen?

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.947
- Be... Betsy...
- No.

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:59.052
You know what, Mary?
Maybe it's best if you just went home.

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:19.842
<i>The failure of CBS News...</i>

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:23.778
to <i>properly, fully scrutinize
the documents and their source...</i>

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:28.922
<i>led to our airing the documents
when we should have not done so.</i>

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:34.190
<i>Xi was a mistake.
CBS News deeply regrets it.</i>

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:39.832
<i>Also, I want to say,
personally and directly, I am sorry.</i>

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:44.972
CBS has hired the firm of Kirkpatrick
<i>&</i> Lockhart Nicholson Graham...

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.607
to conduct a review panel.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.937
You paper-trailed them.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:51.868
Of course.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:56.049
They're a big firm, got about a thousand
lawyers headquartered in Seattle.

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:59.048
They specialize
in internal investigations.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:03.348
They're the same ones that Bush brought
in last year to rip apart WorldCom.

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:04.991
We're as bad as them?

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.855
- Oh, it gets worse.
- The panel...

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:13.527
will be co-chaired by K & L partner
Richard Thornburgh.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:17.169
He's the former governor
of Pennsylvania, first appointed...

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.566
as a U.S. attorney
under Richard Nixon.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:23.333
Ran for Congress twice.
Defeated both times by Democrats.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.638
His second campaign
was run by Karl Rove.

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:27.870
Yup.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.482
But the crown jewel in his rÃ©sumÃ©...

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:33.381
is the time served
as U.S. attorney general from '88 to '91

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:37.023
under former president
George H.W. Bush.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:39.022
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.251
Who goes in first?

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:43.721
First Dan, then me...

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:48.061
then Lucy, the colonel, then you.

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:49.531
You're the grand finale.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.033
And why? Why is that?

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.003
Because they wanna have
as much as they can on you...

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:56.335
when they sit you down in that chair.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.112
Holy shit.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.244
Yeah, I'm sorry.
She's not speaking to reporters.

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:10.847
- It's Heyward.
- If they put someone else on, hang up.

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:14.561
They can't fire you if they
don't have a witness on the line.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.220
- Thanks for the pep talk. Andrew.
- Mary.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.731
We've hired a private detective
to go back over everything.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:25.265
<i>I need you to hand over your notes,
your e-mails, everything.</i>

01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:28.237
Listen, I was thinking,
if we could find the typewriter...

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.740
Stop working on the story.

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:40.750
Well, all work on the Bush-Guard story
has officially ceased.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.483
I can't imagine why.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.252
Hey, what are you looking at, buddy?

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:51.988
The men with the cameras.

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:58.335
Are they friends of yours?

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:07.947
No.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:09.275
Take him upstairs.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:15.246
<i>In other news,
CBS' internal investigation...</i>

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:19.449
<i>into their story on George W. Bush's
National Guard service begins today...</i>

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.686
<i>with the review panel
convening at Black Rock.</i>

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:31.133
I left my wallet in a cab.
I'm supposed to be in front of the panel.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:32.465
You can't be here.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.608
- Excuse me?
- You're not allowed in the building.

01:20:35.798 --> 01:20:38.506
I'm not allowed in the building
according to who?

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:41.773
Management. You have to go, now.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.142
Uh...

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.116
Okay, do you understand
what's happening here?

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.789
I understand you're leaving.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:55.022
Our... Your parent company
is currently lobbying...

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:58.721
a Republican-controlled Congress
for deregulation and tax breaks...

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:02.561
that could potentially save them
hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:06.172
And we just aired a report that
could cost those same Republicans...

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:09.207
- the presidency.
- Security to the 10th ï¬‚oor now.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:13.373
You think Viacom might need
the administration on their side?

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:16.675
You think they might be desperate
to make it up to him right now?

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:20.581
Make up for CBS running stories on
Abu Ghraib, the president, and Vietnam...

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:24.347
and all the other shit that isn't part
of your scheduled programming?

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:28.722
Of course everyone wants it to disappear.
There's a fucking election at stake!

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.922
You're supposed to question everything.
That's your job.

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:36.092
We are supposed to question everything,
and, what, you won't even question this?

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.368
- Are you done?
- Am I done?

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.871
Know when the FCC
repealed cross-ownership laws...

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:45.739
a single company could own 45 percent
of the national market share?

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.844
Forty-five percent
of the national market share.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.415
People fucking ï¬‚ipped.
They lost their shit.

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:54.417
They actually sat down
and wrote their local congressmen.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.284
So in the 2003 appropriations bill,
guess what...

01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:00.084
Congress overturned it. Woo-hoo!

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:03.453
Hooray for democracy, right?

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:06.029
Nope. The president wouldn't sign it.

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:09.759
Bush threatened to veto the bill unless
a compromise was found at 39 percent.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.028
And why 39 percent?

01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:14.902
That's the exact percent Viacom wouldn't
have to sell off any of their stations.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.873
The president of the United States
was ready to take down...

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:22.641
the entire federal budget
so that Viacom wouldn't lose any money!

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.082
You're right.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:34.653
Yeah, we're... We're all evil.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.055
And you're the... You're the...

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:39.129
plucky, misunderstood hero.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.960
It's not that you guys fucked up a story.
No, no, it's... It's...

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:45.765
It's a conspiracy, right?

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:52.408
They're gonna screw you too,
you know.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.492
Hey, I never got to ask you.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.762
Why did you get into journalism?

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:18.168
Curiosity.

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.207
That's it?

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.542
That's everything.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.984
Why'd you get into it?

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.044
You.

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:41.994
Mr. Rather, the panel is ready for you.

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:59.135
It's even worse than we thought.
They asked if you bullied staff or sources.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:02.009
If you physically intimidated people
to get what you want.

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:04.377
I hope you told them
I beat the shit out of you.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.885
Mary, they... It's...
This isn't a joke, okay?

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.215
They asked about your politics.

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:14.417
The deck is stacked, okay?
The game's rigged. Between this...

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:18.254
talk radio and your father,
ifs a fucking lynching.

01:24:19.021 --> 01:24:20.227
What about my father?

01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:25.203
Nothing. I... Don't... it's... Forget it.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.374
What about my father, Mike?

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.032
Look, I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:35.242
<i>I'm ashamed
of what my daughter has become.</i>

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:36.438
You are?

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:38.843
<i>She's</i> a <i>typical liberal.</i>

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:41.214
<i>She went into journalism
with an ax to grind...</i>

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:44.050
<i>mend that was to promote
radical feminism.</i>

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:47.758
<i>So would you say
this is</i> a <i>pattern of hers?</i>

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.224
Oh, sure.

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.955
<i>You know, when I heard
this was</i> a <i>60 Minutes story...</i>

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.294
<i>I figured she would be
the producer of the show.</i>

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.869
<i>She and that Dan Rather
have been working on this...</i>

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:02.202
<i>ever since Bush was elected.
She should really be looking at George...</i>

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.750
<i>Hello?</i>

01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:17.220
You can't talk to the press anymore,
Don.

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:19.552
- Who <i>is</i> this?
- You know who this is.

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:21.558
Just for once in your life, be decent.

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:23.594
<i>I'm expressing my opinion.</i>

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:26.289
<i>I thought you reporters
were aâ€œ about that.</i>

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:29.459
Okay, well,
if you don't stop talking to the press...

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:32.231
I'll ï¬‚y up there myself
and break your fucking arms.

01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:33.998
- How about that?
- Is that him?

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:37.671
- Here, let me talk to him.
- Mar.

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:39.572
- Mark, just give me the phone.
- Mar.

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:41.646
Just give me the phone, Mark.

01:25:43.005 --> 01:25:45.485
- Daddy?
- Yes.

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:52.755
Daddy, please stop.

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:57.752
<i>Well, since you asked, I will.</i>

01:25:57.953 --> 01:25:59.330
Oh...

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.454
I can't anymore.

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:29.989
- Yes, you can.
- No. I don't want to.

01:26:30.152 --> 01:26:33.361
They can have my career. I don't care.

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:37.166
God, I never should have asked
the question.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:41.037
So, what, they're right, you're wrong?

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:43.398
Guess so.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:51.647
And, um, what about Dan?

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.651
That's not fair.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:56.255
"It's a shame
what that woman did to Dan Rather."

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:58.049
- That's what they're saying.
- Don't.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:02.059
"How he's going to go down?
Well, it's just a disgrace."

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:05.559
And Robert'll get to see you quit,
that'll be good for him.

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:07.098
Oh, fuck you.

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:09.064
Listen to me. Listen.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.500
You gotta make your case
to the panel, honey.

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.331
You have to fight.

01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:15.907
- Even if the system's rigged?
- The system is rigged.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.066
It always has been. You know that.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.210
You still have to tell them
what happened.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:25.074
Why?

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:31.051
Because that's what we do.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:50.240
So do you believe me?

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:54.213
Do you believe I did my job?

01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:57.103
I told you it doesn't
matter what I believe.

01:27:57.129 --> 01:27:58.141
It does to me.

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:01.212
If you'd like someone else
to represent you...

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.652
Why don't you just tell me
why I shouldn't?

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:08.885
- What do you want out of this?
- Excuse me?

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:11.792
Do you wanna get into a debate
about journalism with them...

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:15.298
- or do you wanna keep your job?
- I can't do both?

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.902
Not at this point, no.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:21.070
You're the primary breadwinner,
is that correct?

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.812
Yes.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:29.414
And your son is 7.

01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:33.982
This isn't a trial, this is a hunt.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.588
This is about assignation of blame,
who is at fault.

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:38.156
Because somebody has to be.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.759
Debate that with them,
and you're done.

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.189
You have one chance here.

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:46.364
Among all the conservative lawyers
on that panel...

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:49.092
there is one former journalist
co-chairing it.

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:52.795
Lou Boccardi, the former head
of the Associated Press.

01:28:52.961 --> 01:28:56.499
He's the one man who can
maybe understand what happened.

01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:01.011
You convince him,
maybe he can turn the others.

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:03.781
But if you antagonize them...

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.550
if you bait them, if you fight them...

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.016
you will lose.

01:29:11.146 --> 01:29:13.217
You're fucking hired.

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:20.957
<i>You're going to cooperate
in every way.</i>

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.671
<i>Follow every request and instruction.</i>

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.396
<i>There is no standard here.</i>

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:30.805
<i>No books full of journalistic laws,
no written codes.</i>

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:32.910
<i>There is just opinion,.</i>

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:35.705
<i>And we have to sway it.</i>

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.724
That's Thornburgh.

01:29:55.991 --> 01:29:58.597
- Which one's the journalist?
- He's just there.

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:06.604
Ms. Mapes, thanks for coming in.
Mm-hm.

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:10.238
I'm Larry Lanpher. I'm lead council
along with Mike Missal here.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:11.748
Pleasure.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.851
I notice there's no stenographer.

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:16.249
Well, this is an internal investigation.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.255
We're just gonna take some notes
as we go along.

01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:21.785
So there'll be no official record?

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:24.188
It's fine.

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:27.726
Would you like to take
a bathroom break before we begin?

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:29.800
You sure?

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:31.130
I'm not that delicate.

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:36.105
- I'd like one.
- Okay.

01:30:36.298 --> 01:30:38.107
Start again in two minutes, everyone.

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:46.949
I want you to stay calm in there.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.714
- Don't I look calm?
- Not even a little.

01:30:50.412 --> 01:30:52.756
Now, they're gonna try
to catch you off balance.

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:55.394
When they ask you a question,
answer it.

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:58.128
Tell them what time it is,
not how to build a clock.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.323
- But...
- Don't fight.

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:02.825
Okay?

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:06.899
Okay.

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:08.396
Don't fight.

01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:23.116
I'd like to talk a little bit
about language.

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:25.420
Absolutely.

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:28.651
This is a printout of e-mails
sent back and forth by your group...

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.138
during the investigation.
Mm-hm.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:33.299
In this one to Mike Smith,
what did the two of you mean...

01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:37.665
when you referred
to a piece of "tasty brisket"?

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:42.872
That referred to a piece of information
Mike uncovered...

01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:46.103
working on a documentary
for the Germans.

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:49.204
A piece of information
against the president?

01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:55.220
I think specifically, it referred to Bush
losing his nerve while flying.

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:58.981
Which you did not mention
in the report you aired on 60 Minutes.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.524
I didn't think we had it nailed down.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:03.185
Would it be accurate to say...

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.560
you were looking for
anything negative about the president?

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:09.497
I'd say it's accurate we were
looking for any information...

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:12.160
on his time in the Guard
that hadn't come to light.

01:32:12.394 --> 01:32:14.396
And that's what made it tasty?

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:17.543
Not because it reflected poorly
on the president?

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:22.148
It was tasty because
it had the potential to be newsworthy.

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:25.375
Look, Mike and I are friends,
so we use shorthand.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.213
Sarcasm, jokes. You know.

01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:29.480
Is that common in your industry?

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:30.879
I suppose.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:34.858
When dealing with matters <i>as</i> serious
as this, ifs common to make jokes?

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:40.056
I can assure you,
we take our work very, very seriously.

01:32:40.255 --> 01:32:41.757
Hm.

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:44.733
I also wanted to ask you
about this e-mail...

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:50.343
from Roger Charles where he says
he feels better about the documents...

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.535
Mmhm.
Because of their formatting.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.772
Colonel Charles originally thought
the documents were fake?

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.614
I don't believe so.

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:01.580
Then... Then... Then why would
he say he feels better?

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:06.123
Because it seemed that
what our source was telling us was true.

01:33:06.281 --> 01:33:11.594
I have to disagree. Even the subject line
in the e-mail is "I feel better"...

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:14.461
with three exclamation points.

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:17.228
It seems Colonel Charles
initially had doubts.

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:23.137
I think you'd have to ask
Colonel Charles.

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:26.708
Hm. Mm-hm.

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:33.148
But also, um, I would say that he was
coming from the place of not being sure...

01:33:33.308 --> 01:33:37.222
if the memos were real or not, and then
becoming confident that they were.

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:38.948
Really?

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:43.127
Forgive me for saying, but your testimony
so far doesn't bear that out.

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:44.763
- How so?
- Excuse me.

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:46.830
This isn't testimony, remember?

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.598
If it was impossible
to authenticate the memos...

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:53.432
doesn't it stand to reason that you
initially assumed the memos were real...

01:33:53.595 --> 01:33:56.974
- rather than the other way around?
- I wouldn't say that.

01:33:57.332 --> 01:33:58.811
Well, what would you say?

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:02.672
It seems you assumed the memos
were real from the outset...

01:34:02.904 --> 01:34:06.113
and you looked to make sure
that nothing disproved that.

01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:11.417
Essentially, you took the position that the
president was guilty until proven innocent.

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:14.855
We took several steps
to vet these memos.

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:16.323
Mm-hm. Such as?

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:18.585
- Well...
- There were only...

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.691
two signatures,
only two sets of initials.

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:23.461
Hardly enough comparison
for a handwriting match.

01:34:23.625 --> 01:34:27.038
And you said yourself that no carbon
or ink tests could be performed.

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:30.937
In fact, two of the four analysts you
hired said they had strong reservations...

01:34:31.099 --> 01:34:32.635
about the memos' authenticity.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.805
Much of the formatting and terminology
used is consistent with the period...

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:38.348
- as is...
- That's debatable.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.385
Consistent with the period,
as is the content of the memos...

01:34:41.543 --> 01:34:45.184
which was verified by several sources,
including those close to Killian.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:48.350
Um, then, uh, what about this?

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:49.654
Um...

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:52.823
"OETR"?

01:34:54.222 --> 01:34:57.635
Is this one of the terminologies
that's consistent with the period?

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:59.203
Mm-hm. I believe so.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.308
- What does that stand for?
- Officer Effectiveness Training Report.

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:07.344
Actually, the correct acronym
is OER.

01:35:07.502 --> 01:35:11.211
Officer Effectiveness Report. No T.

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:15.577
Isn't it true that "Officer Effectiveness
Training Report" doesn't appear...

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:19.418
anywhere on any official document,
and this is a phrase that you created...

01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:22.994
to explain this incorrect abbreviation
in your memos?

01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:25.654
- That is not true.
- It isn't?

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.595
- I would not do something like that.
- Then prove it.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:52.421
Official document, top of the page.

01:35:52.714 --> 01:35:54.022
Um...

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:55.422
Tab 21.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.196
- Mike?
- Of course.

01:36:05.627 --> 01:36:07.129
Oh.

01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:09.402
I see that.

01:36:09.564 --> 01:36:11.441
I'm sorry, my mistake.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.287
Clearly, you did well.

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:28.791
They're gonna regroup,
call you back in next month.

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:30.293
Next month?

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:34.422
They've decided to delay announcing the
panel's findings till after the election.

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:38.062
Don't look so glum.
Just keep your head down.

01:36:38.226 --> 01:36:39.637
You'll make it out of this.

01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:47.676
<i>I'm looking forward to
sen/ing this country for four more years.</i>

01:36:48.069 --> 01:36:50.481
<i>I wanna thank you for
your hard work in the campaign.</i>

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:54.984
<i>I told you that the other day and you
probably thought I was seeking votes.</i>

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:59.687
<i>But now that you voted,
I really meant it.</i>

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:01.985
<i>I appreciate the hard work
of the press corps.</i>

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:05.620
<i>We all put in long hours. You're away
from your families for a long period.</i>

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:08.131
<i>But the country's better off
when we have...</i>

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:10.667
<i>a vigorous and free press
covering our elections.</i>

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.437
<i>And thanks for your work.</i>

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:16.166
<i>Without over-pandering,
I'll answer</i> a <i>few questions.</i>

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:17.672
<i>Hunt?</i>

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.210
<i>Mr. President. Thank you.</i>

01:37:20.368 --> 01:37:24.783
<i>As you look at your second term, how
much is the war in Iraq going to cost?</i>

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:28.853
<i>Do you intend is send more troops
or bring troops home'?</i>

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.320
<i>And in the Middle East more broadly...</i>

01:37:31.479 --> 01:37:35.188
<i>do you agree with Tony Blair
that revitalizing the Middle East...</i>

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:40.732
<i>peace process is the single most
pressing political issue facing me world?</i>

01:37:41.122 --> 01:37:42.829
<i>Now that I've got
the will of the people...</i>

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:47.200
<i>I'm going to start enforcing
the one-question rule.</i>

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:49.003
<i>Thai was three questions.</i>

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:54.544
<i>I'll star? With Tony Blair's comments.</i>

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.903
<i>I agree with him that the Middle East
peace is a very...</i>

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:07.582
Hello.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:13.525
Mary, it's Dan plus three.

01:38:13.688 --> 01:38:17.261
Well, I'm working on
a Chardonnay Xanax cocktail...

01:38:17.425 --> 01:38:19.701
- if it makes you feel any better.
- Heh.

01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:23.434
Did you know that 60 Minutes
was the first news program...

01:38:23.598 --> 01:38:25.544
to ever make money?

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.704
Before that, all news divisions
operated at a financial loss.

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:36.546
<i>You know, when the government
gave the networks the airwaves...</i>

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:39.452
it was with the stipulation that...

01:38:39.614 --> 01:38:43.357
they'd be used in some capacity
for the public good.

01:38:43.551 --> 01:38:45.360
And that... That was the news.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.023
They... They made their money
elsewhere on the schedule.

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:51.431
But reporting the news was a duty.
It was...

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:52.965
It was a trust.

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:58.036
<i>You know when Don Hewitt
started 60 Minutes, it was in</i> 1968...

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:01.145
it built to enormous ratings.
God, it was...

01:39:01.369 --> 01:39:03.315
God, I! Was wonderful.

01:39:03.471 --> 01:39:08.284
I mean, people were really
watching the news. I mean, they cared.

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:11.484
And, God, we figured out
a way to give it to them.

01:39:11.646 --> 01:39:13.592
I was there, Mary.

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:18.730
I was there the day they figured out
that news could make money.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.065
<i>Hm,.</i>

01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:24.433
After a while it dawned on them,
"How come the evening news..."

01:39:24.592 --> 01:39:26.936
isn't a profit center too?

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:30.234
"Why aren't the morning shows
earning more?"

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:35.437
If you interview Survivor contestants
instead of survivors of the genocide...

01:39:35.603 --> 01:39:38.015
your ad rates go up.

01:39:40.908 --> 01:39:45.323
Pretty soon we won't even run down our
own stories because it's too expensive.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.515
We'll just...

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:53.027
We'll just pay someone else to do it,
then we'll read them on the air for show.

01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:59.305
It was a public trust once.

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:02.304
I swear to you it was.

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:06.770
How you doing, Dan?

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:11.712
I'm stepping down as anchor.

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.285
When'?

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.691
After inauguration.

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:28.534
Oh, Dan.

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:31.568
You didn't cause this, Mary.

01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:35.132
Well, you're a shitty liar,
you know that?

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.569
Why didn't you ask me?

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:45.415
<i>Because God knows everybody else did
when the shit hit the fan.</i>

01:40:45.573 --> 01:40:47.519
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.712
Ask you what?

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:53.151
Why didn't you ask me
if the documents were real?

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:57.422
Because I knew I didn't need to.

01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:01.423
<i>Hey.</i>

01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:04.593
When you go back in there,
you hold your head up, you understand?

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:07.866
Yes, Dan.

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:10.868
Okay. F.E.A.

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:16.407
F.E.A.

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.613
You're doing great.

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.817
Another half hour, and you're done.

01:41:57.378 --> 01:41:58.584
What does that mean?

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:06.227
Fuck 'em all.

01:42:11.092 --> 01:42:14.005
Well, I'm glad we have clarification
on that.

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:17.665
- Good.
- Well, if there's nothing else...

01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:20.105
Thank you, gentlemen, for the day.

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:26.941
Aren't you gonna ask me
about my politics'?

01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:30.114
Excuse me?

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:34.589
You asked other people what I believe,
so aren't you gonna ask me'?

01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:36.518
What are you doing?

01:42:37.118 --> 01:42:41.828
Well, wouldn't you say most of the people
you work with consider you a liberal?

01:42:44.859 --> 01:42:48.671
Do you mean, "Am I now
or have I ever been a liberal?"

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:02.016
it's a legitimate question.

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:03.644
Is it?

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:05.289
Well, you brought it up.

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:09.294
No, you did, when you asked
all of my co-workers.

01:43:09.717 --> 01:43:10.821
So I'll tell you.

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:14.363
I don't believe in labels. I think
most people have a mixture of views...

01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:16.297
That's not what we're talking about.

01:43:16.457 --> 01:43:18.494
Then what are you talking about,
Larry?

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:21.833
We are talking about you bringing
your politics into your reporting.

01:43:21.996 --> 01:43:24.738
- I did nothing of the kind.
- Nothing? Really?

01:43:24.899 --> 01:43:27.743
Is that why when Barnes told you
he got Bush into the Guard...

01:43:27.902 --> 01:43:29.643
you believed him without question?

01:43:29.804 --> 01:43:33.342
That when Bill Burkett, an outspoken
Bush critic and admitted liar...

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:37.488
brought you memos, you assumed
their authenticity and didn't source them?

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:41.524
That when not one but two
of the four document examiners...

01:43:41.716 --> 01:43:43.662
expressed doubts the memos
were real...

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:45.991
you pushed that aside
and rushed this on air?

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:49.066
Or why you personally contacted
the John Kerry campaign...

01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:52.204
on behalf of Bill Burkett,
a man who has dedicated himself...

01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:54.361
to smearing the president?

01:43:54.562 --> 01:43:55.870
Tell me, Mary.

01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:59.944
Where exactly does politics
not enter into this?

01:44:00.568 --> 01:44:03.344
Or are you just that bad at your job?

01:44:04.171 --> 01:44:06.777
Do you know what it would take
to fake these memos?

01:44:06.941 --> 01:44:09.251
.Mary.. No, this is important.

01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:12.948
It would require the forger
to have an in-depth knowledge...

01:44:13.114 --> 01:44:17.358
of the 1971 Air Force manual,
including rules...

01:44:17.518 --> 01:44:19.964
and regulations and abbreviations.

01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:22.761
He'd have to know
Bush's official record front to back...

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:25.369
to make sure none of the memos
conï¬‚icted with it.

01:44:25.526 --> 01:44:28.700
He'd have to know all the players
in the Texas Air National Guard...

01:44:28.863 --> 01:44:32.401
at the time... Not just their names,
but their attitudes, their opinions...

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.603
â€œincluding how
they related to one another.

01:44:34.769 --> 01:44:37.807
He'd have to know Colonel Killian
kept personal memos like this...

01:44:37.972 --> 01:44:39.815
for himself in the first place.

01:44:39.974 --> 01:44:42.614
He'd have to know
how Killian felt at the time...

01:44:42.777 --> 01:44:46.953
particularly about his superiors
and then First Lieutenant Bush.

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:50.755
He would have to know
or learn all of this...

01:44:50.918 --> 01:44:54.957
in order to fool us
as you assume he did.

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.567
Now...

01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:59.670
do you really think that a man...

01:44:59.827 --> 01:45:02.831
who takes this kind of time
and precision...

01:45:02.997 --> 01:45:06.342
then goes and types these up
on Microsoft Word?

01:45:13.574 --> 01:45:19.149
Our story was about whether Bush
fulfilled his service.

01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:22.260
Nobody wants to talk about that.
They wanna talk about fonts...

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:24.418
and forgeries
and conspiracy theories.

01:45:24.585 --> 01:45:28.499
Because that's what people do
these days if they don'! Like a story.

01:45:28.656 --> 01:45:30.363
They point and scream.

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:33.130
They question your politics,
your objectivity. Hell...

01:45:33.294 --> 01:45:34.534
your basic humanity.

01:45:34.762 --> 01:45:38.335
And they hope to God
the truth gets lost in the scrum.

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:40.273
And when it is finally over...

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:43.472
and they have kicked
and shouted so loud...

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:46.982
we can't even remember
what the point was.

01:45:48.209 --> 01:45:50.780
But you didn't prove it.

01:45:52.847 --> 01:45:57.193
You didn't prove Ben Barnes
got the president into the Guard.

01:45:57.484 --> 01:46:00.055
You didn't prove the memos are real.

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:03.564
The burden of proof is on you.

01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:07.068
By that standard, The <i>Times</i> would
never have run the Pentagon Papers.

01:46:07.228 --> 01:46:09.333
The Post wouldn't have listened
to Deep Throat...

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:13.706
- Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat.
- He's confessed to abusing his power...

01:46:13.868 --> 01:46:16.576
to keep some of the richest,
privileged sons of Texas...

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:19.047
from getting their asses blown off
in Vietnam.

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:20.810
Ms. Mapes.

01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:24.079
Don't you think it's possible,
just possible...

01:46:24.812 --> 01:46:26.758
that some of those fine, young...

01:46:26.981 --> 01:46:29.359
privileged men, as you call them...

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:35.261
got into the National Guard
on their own merit?

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:48.609
No, sir. No, I do not.

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:09.458
You had to do it, didn't you?

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:13.734
In the immortal words of Popeye,
"I am what I am."

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:17.906
Well. I would have gone with
"To thine own self be true"...

01:47:18.065 --> 01:47:19.942
but Popeye works.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.309
They'll have their findings in a few weeks.
I'll call you when I hear.

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:26.747
All right. Thanks.

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:31.451
Hey, Mary.

01:47:33.047 --> 01:47:34.822
I believe you.

01:47:46.894 --> 01:47:51.104
But I think he needs a helmet.
Have you got a helmet?

01:47:51.265 --> 01:47:55.771
- Uh... A helmet?
- He needs a helmet.

01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:59.278
- Oh, he hasn't got a head.
- Dang it.

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:02.853
- Can you find a head?
- Um...

01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:04.846
No.

01:48:07.081 --> 01:48:11.689
- Unless you want to chop his head...
- Chop his head off? Maybe.

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:20.037
Hello'?

01:48:20.194 --> 01:48:23.664
<i>Mary, the report is out
and it's very bad. Uh...</i>

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:26.544
<i>I'm putting Jonathan Anschultz
on the fine.</i>

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.771
<i>- Jonathan, can you hear me?
- Yeah.</i>

01:48:29.036 --> 01:48:32.347
Mary, as I said, the report's bad.
You're being terminated.

01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:37.784
<i>It's not something I would've chosen
to do under the circumstances, but...</i>

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:37.639
Hippie scum.

01:50:38.599 --> 01:50:40.670
Jarhead fuck.

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:45.940
If you ever need a reference...

01:50:46.273 --> 01:50:47.616
What, you can...

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:50.414
tell them how we destroyed
modern journalism together?

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:59.697
I'll see you around.

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.994
<i>We've shared</i> a <i>lot in the 24 years...</i>

01:51:07.161 --> 01:51:09.664
<i>, we've been meeting here
each evening.</i>

01:51:10.197 --> 01:51:15.306
<i>And before I say good night,
this night, I need to say thank you.</i>

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:19.673
<i>Thank you to the thousands of
wonderful professionals at CBS News...</i>

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.615
<i>past and present...</i>

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:25.346
<i>with whom it's been
my honor to work over these years.</i>

01:51:26.647 --> 01:51:29.628
<i>And</i> a <i>deeply felt thanks to all of you...</i>

01:51:29.783 --> 01:51:33.526
<i>who have let us into your homes
night after night.</i>

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:38.497
<i>It has been</i> a <i>privilege,
and one never taken lightly.</i>

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:44.700
<i>To</i> a <i>nation still nursing a broken heart
for what happened here in 2001...</i>

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:47.641
<i>and especially those
who found themselves closest...</i>

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:49.803
<i>"in the events of September the 11th."</i>

01:51:51.138 --> 01:51:56.053
<i>To our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen
and Marines in dangerous places.</i>

01:51:56.877 --> 01:52:00.017
<i>And to those who have endured
the tsunami.</i>

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:03.024
<i>And to all who have suffered
natural disasters...</i>

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:06.187
<i>and who must find the will to rebuild.</i>

01:52:06.653 --> 01:52:11.033
<i>To the oppressed and to those
whose let it is to struggle...</i>

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:14.934
<i>in financial hardship
or in failing health.</i>

01:52:16.363 --> 01:52:17.899
<i>To my fellow journalists...</i>

01:52:18.332 --> 01:52:22.781
<i>in places where reporting the truth
means risking all.</i>

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:26.282
<i>And to each of you...</i>

01:52:27.241 --> 01:52:28.743
courage.

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:33.390
<i>For the CBS Evening News,
Dan Rather reporting.</i>

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:36.451
<i>Good night.</i>

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:16.823
- My God. Heh.
- Heh.

01:54:19.286 --> 01:54:21.163
You wanna go for a walk?

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:22.823
Yeah.

01:54:22.847 --> 01:54:38.847
