00:51.434 --> 00:54.601
Okay, Luche, you got 212.

00:54.634 --> 00:58.100
Perleman, you got cab 814.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.367
Susman, you got

00:59.400 --> 01:01.234
Nine fifty-one.

01:01.267 --> 01:06.267
And Zelinko, you got
cab 636, and wash it!

01:06.300 --> 01:07.701
Come on. Come on.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.968
Let's get this
garage moving here.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.267
Latka.

01:13.701 --> 01:16.734
It hurts me to see
you not working.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.934
It makes me want to press
a nerve in your neck.

01:19.968 --> 01:22.434
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

01:24.567 --> 01:25.634
Says you.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.634
Did you fix this cab?

01:28.667 --> 01:29.701
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

01:29.734 --> 01:30.901
It's all fixed?

01:31.834 --> 01:33.400
Let me take a look here.

01:39.834 --> 01:42.200
I don't need that.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.300
Everything works?

01:49.334 --> 01:50.634
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

01:50.667 --> 01:52.367
Whistle-clean?

01:52.400 --> 01:55.167
( <i>weak whistle</i> )

01:55.200 --> 01:56.767
So there's nothing more to do.

02:03.467 --> 02:05.601
Ooh!

02:05.634 --> 02:08.032
Now you can
put that back.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.633
And you know why
I did that, Latka?

02:10.667 --> 02:13.334
Because you are
a terrible person.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.367
Yes.

02:16.901 --> 02:18.367
I'm telling you, Tony.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.868
I booked $120.

02:19.901 --> 02:21.133
Never.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.400
Hey, man.
It's the truth.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.968
Now, I was really hot
tonight, and I booked $110.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.968
Now, what can I tell you?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.033
The truth.

02:28.067 --> 02:29.400
You know, I can't
believe it.

02:29.434 --> 02:31.501
I just can't believe
the man's standing here

02:31.534 --> 02:33.634
telling me to my face
that I can't book $100.

02:33.667 --> 02:35.167
I mean, I just
can't believe it.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.501
Oh, man, you always lie
about your bookings.

02:37.534 --> 02:39.767
On whose life?

02:39.801 --> 02:41.701
On whose life
should I swear

02:41.734 --> 02:43.701
that I booked $90, huh?

02:43.734 --> 02:44.601
On whose life?

02:44.634 --> 02:45.901
Hey, Bob,
what'd you book?

02:45.934 --> 02:47.434
Eighty.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.167
LOUIE:
Hey, Rieger!

02:50.200 --> 02:54.200
Haul your sweaty carcass
over here this second.

02:54.234 --> 02:56.534
Did you detect mellowing?

02:56.567 --> 02:58.534
( <i>gravely voice</i> ):
All right, Louie.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.200
I'm coming.

03:00.234 --> 03:01.934
Hey, John, how you doing?

03:01.968 --> 03:03.000
Well, I'm trying
to figure this out...

03:03.033 --> 03:06.334
Look... I'm going
to have to let

03:06.367 --> 03:08.534
your buddy John go.

03:08.567 --> 03:11.234
I thought I'd tell you first,
'cause he's

03:11.267 --> 03:12.234
your boy.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.400
You brought him in,

03:13.434 --> 03:15.133
so I'm giving you the choice.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.234
I can leave a note
in his pay envelope

03:18.267 --> 03:20.834
saying "You're through, loser."

03:20.868 --> 03:22.567
That's the nice way.

03:24.534 --> 03:25.934
Or I could simply...

03:25.968 --> 03:26.968
Look, Louie, Louie.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.834
All I ask is give him
some time.

03:28.868 --> 03:30.400
He'll get his bookings up.

03:30.434 --> 03:31.400
No way.

03:31.434 --> 03:32.467
Come on, Louie. Be fair.

03:32.501 --> 03:34.501
And start a precedent?

03:34.534 --> 03:36.000
All right, look.

03:36.033 --> 03:38.567
You lose him,
you lose me.

03:38.601 --> 03:39.567
Got it?

03:39.601 --> 03:40.868
Whoo! A threat.

03:40.901 --> 03:42.400
I heard a threat.

03:42.434 --> 03:44.200
And I'm your best booker.

03:44.234 --> 03:46.200
Ooh, a threat
with an explanation.

03:46.234 --> 03:47.334
Louie...

03:47.367 --> 03:49.100
he goes, I go.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.434
A threat that worked.

03:56.968 --> 04:00.033
Banta, I got
a phone message for you.

04:00.067 --> 04:03.501
Yeah? What was it?

04:03.534 --> 04:04.968
You know the rules.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.067
Give me a buck.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.868
( <i>mumbling</i> )

04:08.901 --> 04:10.300
Here's a dollar.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.100
Your gym called.

04:12.133 --> 04:13.067
Oh! What'd they say?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.367
That information

04:14.400 --> 04:16.466
will cost you another buck.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.934
Here's another buck.

04:20.968 --> 04:23.000
They didn't say nothing.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.734
Well, if they're
so unhappy with me,

04:30.767 --> 04:32.200
why haven't they
let me go?

04:32.234 --> 04:35.100
John, that possibility
has not been overlooked.

04:35.133 --> 04:38.100
Gee, I didn't know
it was that serious.

04:38.133 --> 04:40.601
Alex, if I lose this job, I'll
have to drop out of school...

04:40.634 --> 04:42.067
All right, come on, come on,
just relax.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.567
Look, you're not that far
from making it.

04:43.601 --> 04:44.968
All you need is a little
street savvy--

04:45.000 --> 04:46.934
I mean, something that only
experience can teach you.

04:46.968 --> 04:48.968
All right, now look, the first
thing you got to know...

04:49.000 --> 04:50.434
Hey, you guys talking dirty?

04:50.467 --> 04:51.367
No.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.534
Oh.

04:52.567 --> 04:54.734
Alex is just teaching
me some taxi tricks

04:54.767 --> 04:56.234
he's learned
over the years.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.400
Yeah, this might be good
for you, too.

04:57.434 --> 04:58.501
Come on, sit down.
Sure.

04:58.534 --> 05:00.601
Now don't feel bad if
you don't know this stuff.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.234
This is ten years
talking to you now.

05:02.267 --> 05:03.501
Okay, now, first,
your airports.

05:03.534 --> 05:05.501
The best day to go to
the airport is Sunday,

05:05.534 --> 05:08.601
because the traffic is light,
and the wait is short.

05:08.634 --> 05:09.834
There are also times

05:09.868 --> 05:10.968
you shouldn't go
to the airport.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.167
Now, not many people
know this...

05:12.200 --> 05:14.534
Hey, hey, hey...
you want a great tip?

05:14.567 --> 05:15.868
Here it is.

05:15.901 --> 05:19.267
Never pick up a cripple.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.367
Louie! That is the rottenest
thing I ever heard.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.367
You know, I'm not even going
to bother to tell you why,

05:25.400 --> 05:27.367
but first of all,
you don't call them "cripples."

05:27.400 --> 05:29.601
You call them
"handicapped persons."

05:29.634 --> 05:32.000
You're right.
I'm embarrassed.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.000
ELAINE:
Okay.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.868
Okay, John,
forget what I said.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.534
The people you should
never pick up

05:37.567 --> 05:40.067
are handicapped persons.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.067
The reason is,
in the time it takes you

05:43.100 --> 05:46.534
to help one of them
in and out of your cab,

05:46.567 --> 05:47.400
you could pick up
maybe ten guys

05:47.434 --> 05:50.567
who could get in and out
all by themselves.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.834
So, no handicapped persons.

05:53.868 --> 05:56.734
Cabs are only for people
who can walk.

05:59.501 --> 06:02.100
You have to forgive Louie.

06:02.133 --> 06:04.501
He's himself today.

06:04.534 --> 06:07.400
Hey, great news!
I just called the gym.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.100
They want me to spar
with Carlos Navarone.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.400
The champ?

06:11.434 --> 06:12.634
Oh, wow!

06:12.667 --> 06:16.367
Imagine, the champ
hitting my face.

06:37.601 --> 06:40.868
Wow, hey, this is real.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.968
I've never seen anything
like this before.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.968
* Down in the valley

06:55.033 --> 06:57.133
* Where the green
grass grows *

06:57.167 --> 06:59.968
* There sat Elaine,
pretty as a... *

07:03.601 --> 07:06.300
Hey, it was just
a joke, you know.

07:06.334 --> 07:08.234
I was just being silly.

07:08.267 --> 07:09.300
Hey, come on.

07:09.334 --> 07:11.300
Haven't you ever
felt like being silly?

07:11.334 --> 07:13.467
Well, good luck
on your career.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.834
( <i>conversing quietly</i> )

07:15.868 --> 07:17.601
I don't know,
I still think

07:17.634 --> 07:20.834
we went a little bit
overboard with the present.

07:20.868 --> 07:22.934
I mean, uh, what's
the big deal here?

07:22.968 --> 07:25.000
It's a big deal to Tony.
Yeah.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.534
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I...

07:27.567 --> 07:29.601
Well, at least it was smart
getting him a robe, huh?

07:29.634 --> 07:31.067
He can wear it
when he's fighting

07:31.100 --> 07:32.400
and when he's convalescing.

07:32.434 --> 07:34.334
Hey, here's our man now.
Hey, Tony!
Tony!

07:34.367 --> 07:35.467
Tony!

07:35.501 --> 07:36.501
Hey, Tony!

07:36.534 --> 07:38.968
Gee, it's great
to see you guys.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.033
Uh, listen, Tony,
we got you something

07:42.067 --> 07:44.200
to commemorate
the occasion.

07:44.234 --> 07:45.534
It's from everybody
down at the garage

07:45.567 --> 07:50.367
except for, uh,
Louie, Vince, Charlie, and Ed.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.901
They refused to cough up.

07:55.701 --> 07:56.734
( <i>giggling</i> )

07:56.767 --> 07:57.767
Aw, man.

07:57.801 --> 08:00.000
My name, too!

08:00.033 --> 08:01.167
Oh, it's okay.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.501
You know, I was going to
put, like, "Killer Banta,"

08:03.534 --> 08:04.667
"Tiger Banta..."

08:04.701 --> 08:06.567
No, no, I found it's best
not to wear a robe

08:06.601 --> 08:07.934
that makes
your opponent crazy.

08:07.968 --> 08:10.267
Well, come on, try it on.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.200
Yeah. I'll help you.

08:12.234 --> 08:13.934
Ooh, ooh.

08:13.968 --> 08:16.467
Ooh, turn around.

08:16.501 --> 08:17.934
Beautiful!

08:17.968 --> 08:19.400
Beautiful.

08:19.434 --> 08:20.467
Oh, man.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.100
BOBBY:
Feels good, huh?

08:22.133 --> 08:25.033
You know, I never had a
robe before, of my own.

08:25.067 --> 08:27.667
I'd go in with just a towel
wrapped around my neck.

08:27.701 --> 08:28.801
Once, the announcer said:

08:28.834 --> 08:30.400
"In this corner, Holiday Inn."

08:34.801 --> 08:37.900
I guess what I'm trying
to say is thanks.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.433
Aw, well.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.667
Mr. Banta.

08:40.701 --> 08:42.067
Here. Oh...

08:43.501 --> 08:45.167
Jerry Martin.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.067
Oh, sure, I read about you
in the papers, Mr. Martin.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.567
Hey, this is the
champ's manager and
these are my friends.

08:51.601 --> 08:52.734
Elaine Nardo.
Hi, How do you do?

08:52.767 --> 08:53.734
Jerry Martin.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.701
And Alex Rieger.

08:54.734 --> 08:55.501
Hi.

08:55.534 --> 08:56.601
Jerry Martin.

08:56.634 --> 08:57.767
And Bobby Wheeler.

08:57.801 --> 08:58.801
Jerry Martin.

08:58.834 --> 09:01.067
Hi. How you doing, man?

09:01.100 --> 09:02.534
Look, what's your name, son?

09:02.567 --> 09:04.300
Anthony Mark Banta.

09:04.334 --> 09:05.534
I see.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.834
And, uh, what do
your friends call you, son?

09:07.868 --> 09:09.167
Tony.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.100
What would you like me
to call you, son?

09:11.133 --> 09:13.033
I like "son."

09:13.067 --> 09:15.634
Well, you'll be going next

09:15.667 --> 09:18.200
and today, we're using
the 16-ounce glove.

09:18.234 --> 09:19.868
Let me help you
with those.

09:19.901 --> 09:22.868
You'll be going
three rounds with Carlos

09:22.901 --> 09:26.501
and I'd like you to concentrate,
if you will, on the body.

09:26.534 --> 09:28.501
We're trying to toughen
the midsection.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.367
That's fine, but I think I
better warn you.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.100
I've got a pretty good
left hand.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.400
Do you?

09:34.434 --> 09:36.100
Well, you know, I just didn't
want to surprise him with it.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.367
I'm going to let him know.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.100
I still can't believe it.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.367
Me in the same ring
with Carlos Navarone.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.534
His last fight,

09:45.567 --> 09:47.467
I couldn't get
in the same stadium.

09:47.501 --> 09:49.400
Hey, what about
your headgear?

09:49.434 --> 09:50.400
Hey, man, I'm a pro.

09:50.434 --> 09:51.801
I've fought dozens
of times.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.601
You know, what do
I need to, uh...

09:54.634 --> 09:56.000
We all wear them.

09:56.033 --> 09:59.534
JERRY:
Son!

09:59.567 --> 10:00.701
Son!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.200
He's calling you
over there.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.400
Son!
Oh, yeah, Jerry.

10:03.434 --> 10:05.634
Okay, see you.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.367
Yeah. Go ahead, Tony.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.400
Have a good time, huh?

10:10.567 --> 10:14.467
Now listen, I want to see you
really work on the inside.

10:14.501 --> 10:17.000
Keep banging away
at that midsection.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.033
Remember, we got less
than a week,

10:19.067 --> 10:21.400
so let's really pull
out the stops.

10:21.434 --> 10:22.901
( <i>bell rings</i> )

10:22.934 --> 10:26.234
Hey, Alex, could you
help me with this robe?

10:26.267 --> 10:27.901
Oh, yeah.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.234
Go!

10:29.267 --> 10:30.534
No.

10:30.567 --> 10:31.868
Not yet.

10:31.901 --> 10:33.701
ELAINE:
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.667
Try it
from the gloves.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.300
Try it from... right...
Let me do it!

10:36.334 --> 10:37.667
I told you to get
big sleeves.

10:37.701 --> 10:39.901
All the ones
with big sleeves

10:39.934 --> 10:41.968
had Japanese paintings
on them.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Excuse me, can I try something?

10:46.767 --> 10:48.767
( <i>fabric ripping</i> )

10:48.801 --> 10:51.434
Oh...

10:51.467 --> 10:53.801
This is humiliating.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.167
JERRY:
Okay, get going.

10:57.467 --> 10:58.801
Okay.

Hit another left.

Come on, Tony!
All right!

He looks pretty
good in there, huh?

11:25.901 --> 11:27.567
Yeah! Almost
not embarrassing.

11:27.601 --> 11:29.367
Hey, you know,
I bet you it's like

11:29.400 --> 11:31.234
who you're in there with,

I mean, like, like, when I act
with a real pro, I get better.

11:34.601 --> 11:35.634
Yeah, it's the same

11:35.667 --> 11:36.734
with tennis.

11:36.767 --> 11:38.868
When I play with an "A" player,
I get better.

11:38.901 --> 11:41.300
Yeah, it's the same
with sex.

11:43.434 --> 11:44.968
You get better?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.634
They do.

12:00.968 --> 12:02.367
All right, son.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.901
Go for the body.
The body.

Did you see that?

12:15.834 --> 12:17.467
He knocked him down!

12:21.200 --> 12:23.200
Champ, I'm sorry
I hit you so hard.

And that's not love.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.767
That's lust.

13:50.801 --> 13:51.601
No love?

13:51.634 --> 13:52.767
No love.

13:52.801 --> 13:53.934
Better.

13:53.968 --> 13:55.767
I'm teaching you good.

13:55.801 --> 14:00.300
Always remember,

So sorry to disappoint you.

in one lucky punch.

I looked up his record.

And?

15:31.400 --> 15:34.267
He's so good
you can look up his record.

You know, <i>Ring</i> Magazine's

he's sure is going to win.

the macaroni pony fight?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.634

16:43.667 --> 16:46.968
Everybody from the garage
is going to be there.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.300
You think for friendship
they're going to do that?

16:50.334 --> 16:53.133
Not where the old
pocketbook's involved.

* Moment on.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.300
Yeah!

18:43.067 --> 18:45.400
Always wanted to do that.

You know, Alex, I still
can't believe I'm here.

Ever since I'm 14,
not a day goes by

19:02.868 --> 19:05.334

in the gym.

19:05.367 --> 19:06.734
Yeah?

19:06.767 --> 19:07.968
I thought I'd win
the Golden Gloves.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.868
Yeah?
I didn't.

19:09.901 --> 19:11.767
I thought I'd win the Olympics.

19:11.801 --> 19:13.267
I didn't.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.300
I didn't even see the Olympics.
My set blew out.

19:17.567 --> 19:21.234
You ever try to listen
to the Olympics on the radio?

19:21.267 --> 19:22.634
Ah, but it doesn't matter.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.300
It's all okay,
'cause it got me here today.

19:25.334 --> 19:27.000
Hey, how did it happen?

19:27.033 --> 19:29.000
I guess it's destiny, huh?

19:29.033 --> 19:31.868
Well, personally,
I think it's my management.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.601
Boy, this is a bigger fight
than I thought.

19:34.634 --> 19:37.501
The Bee Gees are singing
the National Anthem.

19:37.534 --> 19:38.767
No kidding?

19:38.801 --> 19:41.901
Oh, you son of a gun.

19:41.934 --> 19:43.367
Isn't he something?
You win this fight,

19:43.400 --> 19:46.000
you're never going to have
to drive a cab again.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.667
You're gonna be the first one
to make it out of the garage.

19:48.701 --> 19:50.367
Aw, I can't be
the first one.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.868
Paulie made it.

19:51.901 --> 19:54.601
I'm not sure that shingling
houses with your father-in-law

19:54.634 --> 19:55.834
counts for making it.

19:55.868 --> 19:57.501
Get ready, Banta.

19:57.534 --> 19:58.834
There's a guy in there
bleeding like a pig.

19:58.868 --> 19:59.934
I think they're
going to stop it.

20:03.901 --> 20:06.000
You know, I like
the theater better.

20:06.033 --> 20:07.767
They just say
"five minutes."

20:08.868 --> 20:11.801
Hey, uh... good luck.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.000
Thanks, Bob.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.667
It's okay, Tone.

20:18.334 --> 20:19.601
Hey, Champ, you came.

20:19.634 --> 20:22.167
Yeah, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.801
Oh, thanks.
Hey, Mr. Martin, how are you?

20:23.834 --> 20:24.834
How you doing?

20:24.868 --> 20:25.801
CARLOS:
I see you still got
that great robe.

20:25.834 --> 20:26.801
Oh, yeah.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.234
Those are nice vents
you got there.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.200
Hey, hey, and don't
worry about your title.

20:31.234 --> 20:34.100
I won't be ready for
a couple years yet,

20:34.133 --> 20:35.767
but when I am,
look out.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.601
Right, and, uh,
hey, listen, thanks.

20:38.634 --> 20:39.834
For what?

20:39.868 --> 20:41.868
You know, that little
trick in the gym.

20:41.901 --> 20:42.868
What do you mean?

20:42.901 --> 20:44.400
Hey, didn't he know?

20:44.434 --> 20:46.534
I guess it's okay
to tell him now.

20:46.567 --> 20:47.968
It's real simple, kid.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.834
We were taking in less
money than we should

20:51.868 --> 20:54.567
because Carlos is
considered unbeatable.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.567
So having him sit down
when you punched him

20:56.601 --> 20:58.434
during the sparring match
helped us out.

20:58.467 --> 21:03.400
Hey, run that by me again.

21:03.434 --> 21:05.634
You didn't knock
down the champ.

21:05.667 --> 21:09.501
I don't believe you.
I hit you good.

21:09.534 --> 21:10.634
You're just trying
to cover up

21:10.667 --> 21:11.634
with some crummy story

21:11.667 --> 21:13.000
'cause you don't like
being knocked down

21:13.033 --> 21:14.067
by somebody with no record.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.701
Yeah, I think
we made a mistake.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.367
I don't believe it!
I hit you good!

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
With what?

21:18.434 --> 21:19.367
A left hook to the body.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.868
I'll show you.
Hit me.

21:20.901 --> 21:23.334
If I hit you, you'll go down
like you did in the gym.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.334
Come on, hit me.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.834
You keep it up,
and I will.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.634
You're sure
you don't mind?

21:32.501 --> 21:33.667
( <i>grunting</i> )

21:41.300 --> 21:44.033
Man, what a dirty trick,
building me up like that.

21:44.067 --> 21:46.667
Man, I'm going to teach
this guy a lesson.

21:46.701 --> 21:48.133
You only get one for free.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.801
No, Tony, Tony, Tony.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.067
Now, Mr. Navarone,

21:51.100 --> 21:54.067
you have no idea how
frightened I am right now.

21:54.100 --> 21:56.300
Hey, Tony,
I can't even hold him.

21:56.334 --> 21:57.901
Look, now, why don't you
just laugh this off, huh?

21:57.934 --> 22:00.501
Let him go!

22:00.534 --> 22:01.934
I'll let him go.
Go ahead.

22:01.968 --> 22:03.434
You crazy, Tony?
Yeah!

22:11.901 --> 22:14.000
Okay, Banta,
your turn to fight.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.534
What's wrong with him?

22:15.567 --> 22:17.033
Hey, don't you
know enough

22:17.067 --> 22:19.000
not to interrupt
a man at prayer?

22:22.467 --> 22:23.601
Hey, you all right?

22:23.634 --> 22:26.000
Hey, would you give me
a hand with him?

22:26.033 --> 22:27.567
Sure.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.067
You think you'll be able
to go ahead with the fight?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.667
I think I'll be all right
if I could just

22:33.701 --> 22:35.767
stay away from him for
the first couple of rounds.

22:35.801 --> 22:36.767
Yeah.

22:36.801 --> 22:37.767
Hey, but don't
say anything.

22:37.801 --> 22:38.767
Oh, no, I won't.

22:38.801 --> 22:39.567
Hey, who are you,
anyway?

22:39.601 --> 22:41.100
Your opponent.

22:53.701 --> 22:55.467
Nice to meet you.

23:04.100 --> 23:05.067
What's your name?

23:05.100 --> 23:06.400
Tony Banta.

23:06.434 --> 23:07.834
How many fingers
am I holding up?

23:07.868 --> 23:10.901
Stick to the easy ones.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.234
I came late.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.567
What happened?

23:13.601 --> 23:14.901
I lost.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.234
I know.

23:16.267 --> 23:18.901
I saw every minute.

23:18.934 --> 23:20.901
Here's your
100 bucks, Louie.

23:20.934 --> 23:23.133
Ah, come on,
are you kidding?

23:23.167 --> 23:25.300
I was rooting
for him myself.

23:25.334 --> 23:26.801
Come on, I lost,
I want to pay up.

23:26.834 --> 23:28.601
Come on, are you kidding?

23:28.634 --> 23:30.601
We're from the same garage.

23:30.634 --> 23:31.968
This is the last
time I'm going to offer you.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.934
Gimme.

23:37.133 --> 23:39.334
Well, maybe I won't be
the first guy

23:39.367 --> 23:41.400
to make it out of the garage...

23:41.434 --> 23:43.400
but I'm going to make it.

23:43.434 --> 23:45.200
I'm going to get
a rematch with this guy

23:45.234 --> 23:47.234
and I'm going to be
right back here fighting.

23:47.267 --> 23:49.234
And I'm going to be
right back here managing you.

23:49.267 --> 23:51.000
And I'm going to be here
rooting for you.

23:51.033 --> 23:52.100
And I'm going to be here.

23:52.133 --> 23:53.334
And I'm going to be here.

23:53.367 --> 23:56.601
And I'm going to be here--
making a fortune.
