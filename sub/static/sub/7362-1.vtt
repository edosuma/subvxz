03:22.953 --> 03:25.414
Oh, thank you.
They're pretty peaches.

03:25.497 --> 03:29.001
- Yes, ma'am.
- So, how you been?

03:29.084 --> 03:32.129
I'm pretty good,
I reckon.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.924
You had any health problems
since I saw you last?

03:35.966 --> 03:39.845
- Ma'am?
- Have you been sick?

03:40.971 --> 03:43.599
Well, back's been
hurtin' a little.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.059
No, no, it's not your back.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.438
Have you been
bleeding somewhere?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.483
Well...

03:53.567 --> 03:57.446
- Yes, ma'am, a little.
- Yeah.

03:59.698 --> 04:03.452
- Have you been to a doctor?
- Oh, I...

04:03.493 --> 04:05.537
I don't much like
going to no doctors.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.999
Well, I think
maybe you should go.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.960
No, it's not
a venereal disease.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.672
I just think it's some kind of
kidney or some bladder infection.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.800
But it's been around
for a while.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.969
Could lead to some
more serious problems.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.140
Do you want me
to call a doctor for you?

04:26.683 --> 04:29.853
- All right.
- Okay.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.776
You kids get on to bed now.
It's nearly 9:00.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.738
Ah, Mama, can I stay up
just a little bit?

04:39.821 --> 04:42.324
No.
You heard me, mister.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.955
Mama?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.332
What does "fuck" mean?

04:50.374 --> 04:53.001
It's a bad word, hon,
for something nice.

04:53.085 --> 04:56.588
But what does it mean?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.590
Well, it means making love.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.718
It's how your daddy and me
made your brothers and you.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.182
Take his turtles off, hon.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.143
- Mike, did you hear me?
- What?

05:10.227 --> 05:12.354
I said get to bed.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.652
Oh, Mike, your lip's
dragging the floor.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.655
- It's gonna freeze like that.
- You act like I'm a kid.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.824
You are a kid, honey.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.884
Valerie, you may as well
take your glasses off.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.429
I know he's been hitting you again.

06:27.513 --> 06:31.350
- I see your lip.
- Oh, no.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.102
Oh, it...
it just embarrasses me.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.855
It's okay.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.066
Come on.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.197
He got worse.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.659
I went to the store yesterday
'cause we's out of some things.

06:48.742 --> 06:53.163
And he got home from work early,
before I could get back.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.501
He was waiting with a razor strap.
My legs are all cut up.

06:57.584 --> 07:02.214
And I got welts the size of
footballs on my back and my legs.

07:02.297 --> 07:06.218
I feel guilty, you payin' me money
to tell you to get away from him.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.220
You got to get help.

07:08.303 --> 07:13.392
- Legal help.
- You don't know Donnie Barksdale.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.811
He'll kill me if I leave him.
He'll find me.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.021
He said he would.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.655
No, he's not crazy enough
to kill anybody.

07:26.697 --> 07:30.075
He's just
an insecure redneck.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.204
What?

07:37.166 --> 07:39.293
I think he's got
a woman on the side.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.628
Yeah, he's been
laying out at night.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.093
Excuse me,
but the school's on the phone.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.345
They say Mike's
in some kind of trouble.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.366
Mrs. Wilson.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.786
Hi. Come on in.
Have a seat.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.915
- Where... where's Mike?
- He's in the infirmary.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.959
Now, it's nothing to get
worked up about. He's fine.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.504
He's got a few...
Sit down.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.548
He's got a few,
nicks and bruises.

08:26.590 --> 08:30.427
I think he might have a... have
a pretty good black eye by tomorrow.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.471
But he's...
he's okay.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.765
- He was in another fight?
- Yes, he was.

08:37.433 --> 08:41.480
His grades are... are getting
worse too. How's he doing at home?

08:41.563 --> 08:46.527
Not much better.
He's real distant.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.112
Well, Mrs. Wilson,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.657
I don't pretend to be
a psychologist, but,

08:51.740 --> 08:54.910
it's obvious to me that your boy's
got a lot of anger in him.

08:58.789 --> 09:04.336
Well, it's about this time
last year his daddy passed away.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.588
He's still real
messed up over it.

09:06.630 --> 09:10.467
Yeah. I never knew your husband.
I understand he was a fine man.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.554
Yes, he was.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.892
Well, I don't know how you
feel about therapy, but...

09:18.976 --> 09:21.770
If you think Mike needs somebody to
talk to, I know a gentleman over...

09:21.854 --> 09:24.857
Mike doesn't need a therapist,
Mr. Collins. He can talk to me.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.112
Do you think he will, though?

09:30.237 --> 09:34.616
I'm sorry, Wayne. I didn't know
you had anybody in here.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.077
- Oh, hi.
- Ruby wasn't at her desk.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.497
Yeah, she's out sick today.
Mrs. Wilson, this is Jessica King,

09:40.581 --> 09:42.541
- my fiancee.
- Nice to meet you.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.252
You too.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.964
We're just going to be
a couple of minutes. Okay.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.801
I gotta go anyway.
I got people waiting.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.887
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Collins.

09:54.970 --> 09:59.141
- I'm real sorry about all this.
- Oh, it's my job.

09:59.183 --> 10:02.144
He's just a boy,
that's all.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.357
You're not that Wilson that's
a fortune-teller, are you?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.234
I don't call myself that.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.237
- I'd love you to read my fortune.
- I'm pretty booked up.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.781
Do you think we'll live
happily ever after?

10:41.183 --> 10:43.852
What's the matter?

10:43.894 --> 10:46.021
You see something bad?

10:46.104 --> 10:48.815
Of course not.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.276
No, I'm sure you'll
be real happy together.

11:14.007 --> 11:18.220
- Hey, how you gettin' along today?
- I'm fine, Buddy.

11:18.303 --> 11:22.432
Except the fact I can't keep my car
door from just flying right open.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.893
Have you got the time
to fix it?

11:24.977 --> 11:29.106
I can get to it,
about an hour or two.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.149
You wanna wait?

11:31.233 --> 11:34.444
No. I got to get home.
I got people coming.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.363
Hey, you just want...
you just wanna leave it here,

11:36.405 --> 11:38.365
and I'll...
I'll carry you on home?

11:38.407 --> 11:41.577
I can have it to you by... probably
by 6:00. That gonna be all right?

11:41.660 --> 11:45.455
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
- All right. All right.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.416
- Buddy?
- Yeah?

11:47.499 --> 11:50.586
I'm a little... I'm
a little low on my money this week.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.213
- I was just wondering if...
- Don't you worry about... No, really.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.049
- No, stop it. Oh, come on, look.
- I feel bad.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.802
For all that
you've done for me,

11:58.886 --> 12:01.430
I just... I just think
the world of you.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.143
You're about the only one
I call a friend to me.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.897
Thank you.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.482
Yeah, you know.
Annie.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.902
I'll get the truck.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.070
Take your time.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.454
How you been, Buddy?

12:25.537 --> 12:30.417
I've been having some...
some bad thoughts lately.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.337
But I, you know...
Yesterday, I was feeling so happy.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.756
- Yeah?
- I was feeling on top of the world.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.883
Good on you.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.512
I didn't even feel
like I needed my medicine.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.722
I took it anyway.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.559
You know, I'm getting...
I'm getting hooked on that stuff.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.104
Well, I think you're gonna have
a lot of happy days, Buddy.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.275
Yeah, you're gonna
get better and better.

12:55.317 --> 12:59.321
Well, I believe you
when you say so.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.577
Buddy?

13:05.619 --> 13:08.121
Honey?

13:11.625 --> 13:14.086
Honey, what's wrong?

13:19.424 --> 13:22.803
You have to tell me.
You have to tell me now.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.556
I'll... I'll tell you, hon.

13:26.557 --> 13:30.978
If I look
into a blue diamond...

13:32.396 --> 13:34.857
and I think
a negative thought,

13:37.442 --> 13:39.361
am I gonna die?

13:39.444 --> 13:41.613
No.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.992
You're not gonna die.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.369
You're not gonna die,
Buddy.

13:49.621 --> 13:54.835
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:54.918 --> 13:57.337
Oh, look...

13:57.421 --> 14:00.424
Okay. Well, thank you.
'Cause if you had said ''yes,''

14:00.507 --> 14:03.510
I would have to kill myself
before the sun goes down.

14:03.594 --> 14:07.389
Oh, Buddy. Oh, honey.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.684
You don't have
to kill yourself, honey.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.562
- You know I'll always tell you.
- Oh, man.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.981
- I'll always tell you, Buddy.
- Oh, man.

14:16.023 --> 14:20.360
You're fine. You can always
talk to me, Buddy. Always.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.613
- Oh, don't use that, honey.
- I feel embarrassed.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.824
- No. Here. Huh?
- Oh, no.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.911
- I can't soil that.
- Buddy, I want you to have it.

14:28.994 --> 14:33.040
- This one's Ben's. I don't...
- He'd want you to have it.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.417
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:35.501 --> 14:38.170
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

14:38.212 --> 14:41.089
- All right.
- All right.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.967
I can walk home. You don't
have to drive me. You can...

14:44.051 --> 14:49.181
No, no. No, I'm... I'm good.
I'm good.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.725
- Yeah? You sure scared me, hon.
- Oh, yeah.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.019
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.606
All right. You just take it
nice and slow.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.486
Nice and slow.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.011
Could I help you?

16:09.094 --> 16:11.263
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Donnie Barksdale.

16:11.305 --> 16:15.642
I'm sorry to bother you so late, but
I believe you know my wife Valerie.

16:15.684 --> 16:19.146
Yes, I do.
I know who you are.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.481
Can I come in
and talk to you?

16:21.565 --> 16:25.110
It's about my wife.
Something's happened to her.

16:26.778 --> 16:31.033
What's happened?
She okay?

16:31.116 --> 16:34.328
Well, no, she's not, ma'am.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.122
Ma'am, I promise.
I'll just take a minute.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.462
All right.
Come on.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.398
What's happened is she's getting
her head filled full of shit...

17:04.483 --> 17:06.777
by a goddamn
Satan worshipper.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.696
Or a damn good con artist,
one of the two.

17:10.781 --> 17:14.867
I know she's been coming over
to see you and your damn voodoo.

17:14.952 --> 17:17.871
You tell her bad things
about me, don't you?

17:19.957 --> 17:22.501
You ain't no better
than a Jew or a nigger.

17:34.972 --> 17:38.267
Do you know
what this is?

17:38.350 --> 17:40.310
It's a voodoo doll.

17:41.937 --> 17:45.399
I'm going to use this voodoo doll
on you, some of your own medicine.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.609
If you don't stop
seeing my wife,

17:47.693 --> 17:49.862
I'm stickin' me a pin
in this thing every night...

17:49.945 --> 17:53.490
till you learn
to leave folks alone.

17:54.575 --> 17:57.578
Go back to bed.
Everything's fine.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.418
I bet you love those
little children, don't you?

18:04.501 --> 18:06.503
And I bet they need
their mama, don't they?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.966
- What's your name?
- Get your ass out of my house!

18:11.008 --> 18:14.469
Don't you threaten me or my kids.
Now, what I do here is my business.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.847
If your wife has any sense,
she'll leave you so far behind,

18:16.930 --> 18:18.390
you'll never find her.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.435
Now you get out of here
before I have you thrown in jail.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.945
Messing with the Devil
is gonna get you burned.

18:32.029 --> 18:33.989
Everybody knows that.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.035
I'll see you soon, boys.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.628
Go back to bed.
Come on.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.771
- Something smells like cat pee.
- It's perfume, Ben.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.398
And you're not supposed to cuss
in front of appointments.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.442
Something smells like cat pee.
Something smells like cat pee.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.444
- Something smells like cat pee.
- Be quiet!

19:12.528 --> 19:16.281
He's got a great sense of humor.

19:17.950 --> 19:21.036
Oh, he loves you.

19:21.078 --> 19:25.123
Valerie. Oh, honey,
you know, you should 't be here.

19:27.918 --> 19:30.379
I'm sorry about
the other night.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.340
Oh, that's okay.
I can take care of myself.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.843
And I hate
coming over here, but...

19:38.512 --> 19:41.640
I really need
to talk to you.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.312
Maybe you could read for me.
Under a bridge or something.

19:47.396 --> 19:52.067
All right, I'll read for you. But
you got to start listening to me.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.903
I can't leave him.
Don't you understand?

19:54.945 --> 19:59.324
Hon, he's gonna keep hurting you
till he puts you in the hospital.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.493
I don't have anything
to look forward to.

20:01.577 --> 20:04.329
Maybe you can
give me some hope.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.124
Oh, Valerie, hon, I don't know
how to make myself any clearer...

20:07.207 --> 20:09.835
- Valerie!
- Oh, Annie! Annie, it's him! No!

20:09.918 --> 20:11.837
- Calm down. I'll call the law.
- No. No.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.464
No, Annie, no! If you're
my friend, you won't! No!

20:16.175 --> 20:19.261
I'll deal with you later,
you goddamn bitch!

20:19.303 --> 20:21.471
You witch!

20:21.555 --> 20:23.849
Get your ass in the truck!

20:25.058 --> 20:27.311
That ain't fast enough!

20:27.394 --> 20:31.648
I told you not to come here!

20:31.732 --> 20:36.153
- You let her go!
- All right! All right!

20:38.322 --> 20:41.950
- Get in!
- Mike, you stay there!

20:42.034 --> 20:44.161
What did I fucking tell you?

20:44.244 --> 20:47.247
All right!

20:50.667 --> 20:52.711
Sweet Jesus.

20:55.339 --> 20:58.967
Mike? Y'all bring
Miss Francis her clothes.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.431
Thanks, hon.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.192
Granny.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.486
Hey, Annabelle.

21:19.863 --> 21:24.201
Gran... Granny,
what are you doing here?

21:24.284 --> 21:26.453
I brought you
some persimmons, hon.

21:26.537 --> 21:30.249
Remember how you liked persimmons
when you was little?

21:32.417 --> 21:35.212
Granny, you're not
supposed to be here.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.339
How... How'd you get here?

21:37.381 --> 21:39.842
Oh, it ain't far to walk.

21:41.885 --> 21:45.597
That boy's got
your granddaddy's eyes.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.020
Well, hon,

21:52.062 --> 21:54.189
I better get back.

21:54.273 --> 21:57.359
Looks like
there's a storm coming.

21:57.401 --> 22:00.779
No, Granny,
it... it's clear.

22:15.377 --> 22:19.131
Annie, always use
your instinct, honey.

22:48.577 --> 22:52.080
Now you tell Miss Francis
I'll be home by 9:30, okay?

22:52.164 --> 22:54.458
- Bring back something.
- All right, I promise.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.252
- I love you too, Mama.
- I know. And I love you too, hon.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.047
- Be good. Bye.
- Bye, Mama.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.508
You ready?

23:02.591 --> 23:04.843
I don't know why
I let you talk me into this.

23:04.927 --> 23:07.387
'Cause it's time you quit
living like a nun, that's why.

23:07.471 --> 23:11.141
Don't worry. You're going to be
the prettiest girl here, next to me.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.602
You still a married man?

23:13.685 --> 23:16.355
I don't know about that.

23:16.438 --> 23:20.526
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

23:20.609 --> 23:23.862
- Do we pay him now or...
- I sign for it later.

23:23.946 --> 23:26.073
Is it good?

23:27.199 --> 23:29.535
- Annie, there he is.
- Who?

23:29.618 --> 23:32.830
That guy I... That guy I was
telling you about. Look at him.

23:32.913 --> 23:36.792
He's right over there by the bar.
Don't he look like Antonio Banderas?

23:36.875 --> 23:40.337
Oh, my God! He saw me! Shit!
He saw me staring at him.

23:40.420 --> 23:45.634
All right, get your cards out. Tell
me if he's gonna come over here.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.719
I don't have my cards with me.
I am off-duty.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.847
Hello, Mrs. Wilson.

23:49.930 --> 23:53.559
- It's Annie.
- Sit down. You're blocking my view.

23:55.769 --> 23:59.356
- Sorry. You remember Jessica?
- Hi, Annie.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.233
I didn't know you were a member
of the country club.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.403
I'm not.
I kind of tagged along with Linda.

24:04.444 --> 24:08.198
- How nice. It's a great outfit.
- Thank you.

24:08.282 --> 24:12.161
- What's Mike up to tonight?
- Moping around his baby-sitters.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.580
Yeah? He's...
He's a great kid.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.374
I was actually thinking you should
have him come down to school and...

24:17.457 --> 24:20.419
Come on, Wayne. Let's not talk
shop tonight, all right?

24:20.502 --> 24:22.588
- Let's just have fun.
- Okay.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.424
- Hi there, fun-seekers.
- Hey, there.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.677
- How about a dance with Daddy?
- Of course I will, handsome.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.393
Mr. King, I don't know
if you know, Annie Wilson.

24:36.476 --> 24:40.355
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I think I've seen you at church.

24:40.439 --> 24:44.276
- That is quite a dress, Miss Linda.
- I'm glad somebody noticed.

24:44.359 --> 24:48.947
- You want to give it a try?
- Oh, no. No, I don't think so.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.282
No, thank you.

24:50.324 --> 24:54.203
Come on. I asked you to dance,
not walk on hot coals.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.955
When was the last time
you danced?

24:56.997 --> 24:59.625
I think it's so long,
I've forgotten how to do it.

24:59.708 --> 25:03.921
Well, I'll make you look good then,
'cause I'm a terrible dancer.

25:05.339 --> 25:07.591
Wayne.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.135
I'll dance.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.806
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

25:14.890 --> 25:18.101
Missed your big chance.

25:38.831 --> 25:41.250
Thank you.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.641
Somebody
might come in here.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.477
I guess you
better fuck me fast.

26:14.283 --> 26:16.702
You having a good time?

26:19.288 --> 26:22.040
Me neither.

26:27.087 --> 26:29.256
You seen Jessica around?

26:30.924 --> 26:35.137
She up and disappeared on me again.
She's got a way of doing that.

26:38.557 --> 26:43.020
- What do you think of Jessica?
- She's... She's very beautiful.

26:43.103 --> 26:46.732
Yeah, the main thing
about her, she's just...

26:46.773 --> 26:49.276
so full of life.

26:49.318 --> 26:52.112
We're a little different
in that respect.

26:52.196 --> 26:55.073
Oh.
I'm used to tennis shoes.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.373
This kind of reminds me
when I was a kid.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.668
I'd sit out on that porch.

27:06.752 --> 27:09.922
I'd have so many thoughts,
just couldn't count 'em.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.090
How'd you
wind up in Brixton?

27:12.132 --> 27:15.093
My husband. He got a job here
at the cable plant.

27:16.303 --> 27:18.263
Right.

27:20.974 --> 27:22.935
What?

27:25.145 --> 27:28.273
Did... Did you know...

27:28.315 --> 27:31.527
something was going
to happen to your husband?

27:35.113 --> 27:37.533
In an E.S.P. kind of way?

27:40.327 --> 27:44.206
- Well, I don't know...
- You don't believe in it.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.086
I don't know.
I guess I just...

27:51.338 --> 27:53.465
I don't believe there
are any great mysteries in life.

27:53.507 --> 27:56.552
I kind of figure what
you see is what you get.

28:01.974 --> 28:04.434
Well,

28:04.518 --> 28:07.312
I didn't know that there
was going to be an explosion.

28:07.396 --> 28:11.316
But... the night before,
I had this real bad,

28:11.358 --> 28:13.485
bad dream, you know.

28:13.527 --> 28:16.405
I dreamt that I was all by myself.
That Ben...

28:16.488 --> 28:20.117
He wasn't
around anymore and...

28:20.200 --> 28:23.328
tried to stop him going to work
the next day, but...

28:27.583 --> 28:29.960
So you can't keep
a good man from work, right?

28:36.758 --> 28:39.344
You kind
of remind me of him.

28:42.097 --> 28:44.683
Wayne?

28:44.725 --> 28:48.187
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been right here.

28:50.564 --> 28:52.691
I see.

28:55.027 --> 28:57.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:57.237 --> 29:00.073
Let's go talk to Daddy.
He's feeling real depressed tonight.

29:00.157 --> 29:02.034
That big deal
he's working on went bad.

29:02.075 --> 29:05.078
Oh, we got a major crisis
here, Annie. Excuse us?

29:06.205 --> 29:08.332
- Okay.
- Bye.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.461
See you later, alligator.

29:12.586 --> 29:15.088
- In a while, crocodile.
- Good night, boys.

29:15.172 --> 29:17.216
Go to sleep for Mama.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.969
- What's that, hon?
- Blueberry muffins.

29:21.053 --> 29:23.430
Whatcha doin' with muffins
in your pockets?

29:23.514 --> 29:25.557
Miss Francis cooked them.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.893
Yeah, but what are they
doing in your pockets?

29:27.976 --> 29:31.980
They're in my pockets 'cause I put
'em there when she wasn't looking...

29:32.064 --> 29:34.233
so I didn't
have to eat them.

29:34.274 --> 29:38.320
Her blueberry muffins is terrible.

29:41.073 --> 29:43.992
Y'all wait here a minute.
Take Ben, hon.

31:12.956 --> 31:16.919
When God's fighting for you,
every soldier's important.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.963
When God's fighting for you,
every soldier's important.

31:20.047 --> 31:22.341
God does not give
one to the Devil.

31:22.424 --> 31:24.801
If every child of God
obeyed God,

31:24.885 --> 31:26.803
the Devil cannot
wipe you out.

31:26.887 --> 31:29.097
He cannot take you out
before your time.

31:29.139 --> 31:31.099
If you obey God,
I don't care what the Devil...

31:31.141 --> 31:35.771
has placed upon your life,
Jesus can deliver you.

31:35.854 --> 31:39.441
Jesus came to bring you
out of your prison house.

31:39.525 --> 31:43.445
- Mama, is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

31:43.487 --> 31:47.199
- You sure?
- Yeah. Time for you to go to bed.

31:49.952 --> 31:53.247
I know him. He's
a squirrel-hunting buddy of mine.

31:53.330 --> 31:56.917
- But I don't think that Donnie...
- I'm telling you it was him.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.128
What makes you think he'd want
to bust into your house?

32:00.212 --> 32:03.257
Well, his wife,
she's a client of mine,

32:03.340 --> 32:06.468
and he thinks I'm trying
to break up their marriage.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.929
Are you?

32:09.012 --> 32:12.599
Listen,
Donnie's high-strung.

32:12.683 --> 32:15.352
You know,
ain't no doubt about that.

32:15.435 --> 32:18.021
But I don't think he's the one
that busted into your house.

32:18.105 --> 32:21.441
Listen, I appreciate the coffee
and everything. Take care.

32:29.658 --> 32:33.412
I just can't get through
a wall of some kind in my head...

32:33.495 --> 32:36.665
or... or my soul.

32:36.707 --> 32:39.168
Sometimes I don't
even know the difference...

32:39.209 --> 32:42.379
between my head or my soul.

32:42.462 --> 32:45.174
I think everybody
has that trouble, Buddy.

32:48.844 --> 32:51.054
All right.

32:56.185 --> 32:58.478
Your daddy...

32:58.562 --> 33:02.357
He took things
away from you when you...

33:02.441 --> 33:04.902
when you were a little boy.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.865
Do you understand that?

33:11.700 --> 33:17.039
He... He seen me playing around with
something, like a toy or something,

33:17.122 --> 33:20.167
he'd just
take it away from me.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.878
Did he take other things
away from you?

33:29.134 --> 33:31.678
Buddy...

33:31.762 --> 33:33.889
You got to find out, hon,

33:33.931 --> 33:37.226
why you hate him so much.

33:37.267 --> 33:40.562
My daddy's a good man.
I don't hate my dad.

33:41.813 --> 33:44.024
He's good to Mama and me.

33:46.777 --> 33:50.614
Every kid needs a hit with a belt
sometime. I mean...

33:50.697 --> 33:55.202
Buddy, you got to try to get past
this wall that you're talking about.

33:56.495 --> 33:58.455
Hon, you need to talk
about your daddy.

33:58.539 --> 34:01.917
Why don't you tell me why I hate
him? You're the goddamn psychic!

34:01.959 --> 34:05.420
Huh?
You're the goddamn psychic!

34:24.022 --> 34:26.775
I think I better go.

34:26.859 --> 34:29.152
I have to go home,

34:32.822 --> 34:34.783
right now.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.661
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

34:37.744 --> 34:39.788
It's all right.

34:41.123 --> 34:43.792
I just need...
I just need your help.

34:46.837 --> 34:50.132
I just keep thinking about that blue
diamond. I keep thinking about...

34:50.215 --> 34:55.137
Buddy, if you think about these
things in your childhood, hon,

34:55.179 --> 34:59.266
and you face up to them,
then I will be able to help you.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.812
I know, hon.
I just...

35:03.854 --> 35:07.274
I think you got to do
some thinking on your own.

35:09.735 --> 35:11.695
Okay.

35:11.737 --> 35:14.781
Oh. You...

35:14.865 --> 35:16.783
I'll help you there.

35:16.867 --> 35:20.245
- Okay, you put it up there.
- Hey, Ben.

35:20.329 --> 35:23.123
- Hello?
- You got a lot of pretty things.

35:23.207 --> 35:25.667
I liked looking at them.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.128
You ever seen anybody
skin a squirrel?

35:28.212 --> 35:30.964
You stick a knife
in its belly and zip.

35:31.048 --> 35:33.300
That's what I'm going to do
to you and your children...

35:33.383 --> 35:35.469
you ever call
the police again.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.513
I did not.

35:50.859 --> 35:52.903
Mama?

35:54.738 --> 35:56.949
Hey.

35:57.032 --> 36:00.828
- How come you're not asleep?
- I don't know.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.874
- What's that bat for?
- Oh.

36:05.916 --> 36:09.878
Don't worry, honey.
I'm... I'm just working on my swing.

36:11.713 --> 36:16.051
How come we never go
to the cemetery and see Daddy?

36:16.093 --> 36:20.097
Well, we went out there
just last month on his birthday.

36:21.348 --> 36:23.892
Honey, I'm real busy,
you know that.

36:23.934 --> 36:26.728
Well, it seems like you have time
for a lot of strangers.

36:26.812 --> 36:30.190
If we're talking about my
appointments, they're not strangers.

36:30.274 --> 36:32.651
They're the ones
that put food on our table.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.195
But how come we don't
even talk about Daddy?

36:35.279 --> 36:37.614
Go on, Mike.
I'm trying to read.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.684
- Annie?
- We're going to have to frame that.

37:47.768 --> 37:49.728
- It's just a painting.
- That's beautiful.

37:49.811 --> 37:52.648
- Annie.
- Hey.

37:52.731 --> 37:56.235
Hey, listen. I know why Kenneth King
wasn't in church today.

37:56.318 --> 38:00.280
- Put your belt on. Why?
- 'Cause his daughter disappeared.

38:00.364 --> 38:02.241
Jessica?

38:02.324 --> 38:04.243
What do you mean
she disappeared?

38:04.326 --> 38:06.912
Well, Kenneth woke up this morning
and Jessica wasn't there,

38:06.995 --> 38:08.664
and her bed
hadn't even been slept in.

38:08.747 --> 38:11.083
Annie, you think
she ran off?

38:11.166 --> 38:13.585
I know her and Wayne were
supposed to be married in June.

38:13.669 --> 38:16.588
- Maybe she got cold feet.
- Maybe.

38:16.672 --> 38:19.466
Maybe this will clear
the way for you and Wayne.

38:20.676 --> 38:23.178
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

38:23.262 --> 38:26.807
I saw the way y'all were looking
at each other Friday night.

38:26.890 --> 38:29.351
Y'all both just
had stars in your eyes.

38:29.393 --> 38:31.854
Oh, Linda, that's nuts.

38:31.895 --> 38:35.691
- Yeah. Annie, love is nuts.
- Come on. Go home.

38:35.732 --> 38:39.194
Listen,
I want you to get some rest.

38:39.278 --> 38:41.822
You look terrible, okay?
Bye, boys.

38:41.905 --> 38:44.366
- I got to go.
- Bye, Miss Linda.

38:59.047 --> 39:01.383
Ben, get your hand
out of there!

39:01.425 --> 39:03.385
That's for y'all's
cake tonight.

39:03.427 --> 39:06.847
- What am I gonna ice the cake with?
- I like icin', Mama.

39:06.889 --> 39:09.308
Yeah,
I can see that, punkin.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.351
Miller!

39:12.811 --> 39:14.730
Miller, hon, would you
go ask Miss Francis...

39:14.813 --> 39:17.399
if she's got another
can of icing, please?

39:17.482 --> 39:20.110
- Mama!
- I'm coming, Ben.

39:41.590 --> 39:44.343
Where you going, son?

39:48.972 --> 39:51.225
You wanna ride
in the truck?

39:54.311 --> 39:58.440
I got a question for you.
You know my wife Valerie?

39:58.524 --> 40:01.068
She been around
to see your mama lately?

40:02.361 --> 40:05.572
Hey, boy,
I asked you a question.

40:07.366 --> 40:09.409
Get my hat.

40:16.208 --> 40:19.044
You know, I feel sorry
for you and your brothers.

40:19.127 --> 40:22.089
I mean, your mama
being a witch and all.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.466
If she don't stop
her evil ways,

40:24.550 --> 40:27.010
some day somebody's
gonna burn her up.

40:27.094 --> 40:30.055
And then you boys
are gonna be without a daddy...

40:30.138 --> 40:32.599
or a mama.

40:32.683 --> 40:36.562
Hey, Miller?
You all right?

40:36.645 --> 40:39.940
He said mama's a witch
and they're gonna burn her up.

40:39.982 --> 40:41.984
Oh, he did?

40:46.905 --> 40:50.367
- You better mind your own business.
- I intend to, Donnie.

40:58.584 --> 41:00.586
Motherfucker!

41:00.669 --> 41:03.130
Goddamn it! Fuck!

41:03.172 --> 41:05.174
Look, fucker!

41:06.884 --> 41:08.844
Shoot me!
Shoot me!

41:08.886 --> 41:11.471
Shoot me,
you motherfucker!

41:11.555 --> 41:14.516
Shoot me! Shoot me!

41:31.533 --> 41:33.827
You all right?

41:45.839 --> 41:48.675
Tuscan Rouge.

41:48.759 --> 41:50.886
What was I thinking?

41:53.555 --> 41:55.849
I want icin', Mama.

41:55.891 --> 41:58.018
Hon, you've had icing enough
to put you in a coma.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.062
And from now on,

42:00.103 --> 42:02.064
I want to know where you all are
every minute of the day.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.274
All right?

42:05.692 --> 42:08.278
Mike, I'm gonna start
driving you and Miller to school.

42:09.988 --> 42:12.699
I wish Daddy was here.

42:12.741 --> 42:17.496
Well, he's not, hon.
But Mama is. Okay?

42:23.794 --> 42:25.712
Eat your cake.

42:28.757 --> 42:31.426
- Hello.
- This is Kenneth King.

42:31.510 --> 42:35.055
- Mr. King.
- I imagine you,

42:35.264 --> 42:38.100
heard about
my daughter's disappearance?

42:38.141 --> 42:39.852
- Yes.
- Well...

42:39.935 --> 42:41.895
Mrs. Wilson,
I don't believe in what you do.

42:41.979 --> 42:43.939
I'll just be
straight with you.

42:44.022 --> 42:48.569
Not only that, I don't like it. But
we've got to the end of the road...

42:48.610 --> 42:52.239
and our investigation looked under
every rock there is to look under,

42:52.281 --> 42:55.742
and we'd like you to tell us
what you can to help us.

42:55.784 --> 42:59.246
Now, no hocus-pocus
and chanting and carrying on.

42:59.329 --> 43:03.208
We know you talk to a lot of folks,
know a lot of folks' business.

43:03.292 --> 43:07.254
You might have heard
something or something.

43:07.337 --> 43:09.131
The only thing we know is,

43:09.214 --> 43:13.093
one of Sheriff Johnson's men
found my daughter's car...

43:13.135 --> 43:16.263
sitting out on the parking lot
of that honky-tonk called AyJay's.

43:16.346 --> 43:19.308
But nobody that was there
on Saturday night...

43:19.349 --> 43:21.643
admits to having seen her.

43:21.727 --> 43:25.981
So I'm afraid she might have been
kidnapped or something?

43:27.649 --> 43:30.819
Oh, Mr. King,
I'm... I'm sorry.

43:30.903 --> 43:33.822
I don't know anything about
your daughter's disappearance.

43:33.864 --> 43:36.366
I think
we were just hoping...

43:37.534 --> 43:39.995
Is there anything
you can tell us?

43:40.078 --> 43:42.456
I could read for you.

43:43.874 --> 43:47.336
But that... that's
about all I could do.

43:47.419 --> 43:50.047
I need you
to cut the cards for me.

44:00.307 --> 44:02.226
Oh, boy.

44:08.065 --> 44:10.067
Thank you.

44:17.032 --> 44:19.535
All right.
You ready?

44:21.078 --> 44:23.247
Okay.

44:31.046 --> 44:33.674
When were you
getting married again, Wayne?

44:33.715 --> 44:36.343
- June 20...
- We're supposed to ask questions,

44:36.385 --> 44:38.345
- not you.
- Shut up, Pearl! Goddamn it!

44:38.387 --> 44:40.347
Look, I have a hard time
concentrating...

44:40.389 --> 44:43.016
with more than one person
in the room.

44:43.058 --> 44:47.062
Well, I'm staying right here. I'm
the law, and I need to hear this.

44:47.145 --> 44:50.232
Please, ma'am, just...

44:50.315 --> 44:51.650
just try to tell us
what you see.

44:51.650 --> 44:52.901
just try to tell us
what you see.

44:52.943 --> 44:55.737
I'm trying.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.948
All right.

45:16.383 --> 45:18.343
All right,
all I'm picking up...

45:18.427 --> 45:22.556
it's like a...
it's a fence.

45:22.598 --> 45:25.893
Like a split rail fence.

45:25.934 --> 45:28.770
Do you know how many fences
there are in this county?

45:30.272 --> 45:33.233
And some pillars, like,
with an opening going through.

45:38.280 --> 45:42.117
And there's lots of white flowers.
I can... I...

45:42.159 --> 45:46.830
Yes. And,
is that where Jessie is?

45:58.383 --> 46:02.930
Well, that's... that's, all I'm...
all I'm seeing.

46:03.013 --> 46:06.391
This is just mishmash. I told you
this wouldn't lead to nothing.

46:06.475 --> 46:09.436
You're right. It won't.
I can't concentrate.

46:11.146 --> 46:15.234
- I can't do this now. I'm sorry.
- Please, ma'am.

46:15.317 --> 46:17.319
I really do hope
you find your daughter.

46:17.402 --> 46:21.490
But I'm... I'm just not the person
to help you with this.

49:03.777 --> 49:05.779
Hey, Butch.

49:39.104 --> 49:41.023
And it was horrible.

49:41.106 --> 49:44.026
But that same chain that was wrapped
around her when she was floatin',

49:44.109 --> 49:49.198
you know, up in my tree, it was the
same chain that I had in my dream.

49:49.281 --> 49:52.284
- I don't know. I just thought...
- Dave?

49:54.786 --> 49:57.164
Yes, sir?

49:57.206 --> 49:59.208
I could have sworn there
was an eclair in there.

49:59.249 --> 50:02.419
I didn't get it.

50:04.505 --> 50:07.216
Tim was in
a little earlier.

50:10.552 --> 50:12.346
So you saw all this
in a dream?

50:12.387 --> 50:14.348
It wasn't just a dream.

50:14.389 --> 50:16.475
I don't investigate
somebody's dream.

50:18.018 --> 50:20.062
I think she's dead, Sheriff.

50:20.145 --> 50:23.190
And I think she's in a pond.

50:23.232 --> 50:26.735
What do you know about this
you ain't telling me?

50:26.819 --> 50:30.030
You can get in serious
trouble with holding information.

50:30.072 --> 50:32.157
Does it sound like
a place you know?

50:32.241 --> 50:34.201
Yeah,
a bunch of places I know.

50:34.243 --> 50:37.496
Split rail fence, a pond,
a stretch of woods.

50:37.579 --> 50:40.207
- Every raw bone ol' boy got that.
- What about the fiddler?

50:40.249 --> 50:43.293
Well,

50:43.377 --> 50:45.754
ol' Tommy Lee Ballard
plays a fiddle.

50:45.838 --> 50:48.465
But he wouldn't kill nobody.
I've known him since he's a kid.

50:48.549 --> 50:52.052
No, no, it's not the fiddler.
Who are his neighbors?

50:52.094 --> 50:56.014
Well, his closest neighbor
would be...

50:57.266 --> 51:00.102
Well, let me see here.
I guess...

51:00.143 --> 51:04.398
Well, his property borders,
Donnie Barksdale's place.

51:05.774 --> 51:08.110
Do you know
Donnie Barksdale?

51:10.237 --> 51:12.239
Ma'am?

51:19.121 --> 51:21.373
Tim! On the gate!

51:22.749 --> 51:24.668
You did get
a search warrant, didn't you?

51:24.751 --> 51:26.670
I want everything
to be legal and proper.

51:26.753 --> 51:29.131
Didn't have to.
Got permission from the owner.

51:29.173 --> 51:32.467
Donnie Barksdale
gave you permission...

51:32.509 --> 51:36.096
His wife did.
I told her it was routine.

51:36.138 --> 51:38.473
We're checking all the ponds
in the county.

51:38.515 --> 51:40.684
Donnie's gone fishing today.

51:57.201 --> 51:59.745
Excuse me. Sheriff Johnson?

51:59.828 --> 52:03.665
- How much longer y'all gonna be?
- Long as it takes.

52:03.707 --> 52:07.127
All right. You just said you're
gonna be a few minutes.

52:07.169 --> 52:09.546
And we're
going on two hours.

52:09.630 --> 52:12.633
Hey, Pearl!
I think I got something!

52:41.870 --> 52:45.082
False alarm.
It's just an old bicycle.

52:48.585 --> 52:51.255
None of y'all brought a Thermos
of coffee out here?

53:14.778 --> 53:16.864
That day at school.

53:18.198 --> 53:21.118
You looked kind of strange
at me and Jessica.

53:21.201 --> 53:23.662
Did you think
something bad then?

53:34.298 --> 53:36.758
Shit.
Come on.

53:38.051 --> 53:41.054
- Donnie, he called. I told him...
- Pearl!

53:41.096 --> 53:43.182
Shut your mouth!

53:43.265 --> 53:45.350
Goddamn it, Pearl,
what are you doing on my property?

53:45.434 --> 53:48.854
I'm on Sheriff's business, Donnie.
I got permission from your wife.

53:48.937 --> 53:50.856
You think I let that
little ninny talk for me?

53:52.774 --> 53:55.444
How'd your arm
get all scratched up?

53:57.696 --> 54:01.241
Stray cat. She didn't like it
when I killed her.

54:01.283 --> 54:04.661
- Now what brought you here?
- Just routine investigation.

54:04.745 --> 54:06.955
We're checking
all the ponds in the county.

54:14.588 --> 54:18.008
- I knew it was you.
- No! You!

54:21.803 --> 54:25.349
Hey! I'm on County business,
Donnie. Don't fool with me.

54:25.432 --> 54:28.185
- Hey, Pearl!
- What?

54:28.268 --> 54:31.188
- You need to take a look at this.
- Watch him.

54:31.271 --> 54:34.274
Hault up, boys!

54:42.324 --> 54:45.410
- It's her!
- Donnie?

54:48.288 --> 54:51.667
Get those hooks
out of my baby!

54:51.708 --> 54:54.878
- Get her off them hooks!
- Cuff him!

54:54.962 --> 54:58.257
- No! No!
- Mr. King!

55:00.676 --> 55:03.804
- No!
- Get an ambulance!

55:03.846 --> 55:05.806
I think he's
having a heart attack!

55:05.848 --> 55:08.433
- I didn't do this!
- Get him out of here!

55:08.517 --> 55:10.686
This ain't right!
Pearl!

55:10.727 --> 55:15.023
Bitch! Bitch!
Bitch! Pearl!

55:29.121 --> 55:31.415
Come in.

55:34.334 --> 55:36.253
Somebody might
come in here.

55:36.336 --> 55:39.047
I guess you better
fuck me fast.

55:39.089 --> 55:42.009
You want some coffee?
Mrs. Wilson?

55:44.761 --> 55:47.014
You want some coffee?

55:47.055 --> 55:49.349
No, thank you.

55:49.391 --> 55:51.351
Have a seat.

55:56.857 --> 55:59.151
Why... Why have you
called me here?

55:59.234 --> 56:02.446
Tomorrow Donnie Barksdale goes
on trial for murder...

56:02.529 --> 56:05.616
and I feel
that we have a powerful case.

56:05.699 --> 56:07.618
In fact,
today the coroner verified...

56:07.701 --> 56:10.037
Donnie's tissue
under the victim's fingernails.

56:10.078 --> 56:13.749
Now, I only have one weak link
I got to worry about.

56:13.832 --> 56:17.044
- What?
- You.

56:17.085 --> 56:21.423
You see, you're how we found out
where the victim's body was.

56:21.465 --> 56:24.760
And how you found out,
well,

56:24.843 --> 56:28.055
that might open up
a real can of worms for us.

56:28.096 --> 56:32.643
Psychic phenomena,
E.S.P., dreams, visions.

56:32.726 --> 56:34.978
The defense
could go to town on you.

56:35.062 --> 56:38.273
And if that's not bad enough,
I understand there was bad blood...

56:38.357 --> 56:41.276
between you
and Donnie Barksdale.

56:41.318 --> 56:43.570
Yeah.
He threatened my kids.

56:43.612 --> 56:47.574
That's what I heard. I also heard
that you threatened him right back.

56:47.658 --> 56:49.785
Told his wife
to leave him.

56:52.204 --> 56:54.665
Donnie's quite
a ladies' man.

56:54.748 --> 56:56.959
Were you involved
with him?

56:59.044 --> 57:01.296
- What?
- I can deal with any revelation...

57:01.380 --> 57:03.298
right now.

57:03.382 --> 57:06.301
But at the trial
there can't be any surprises.

57:07.970 --> 57:10.639
So, is there anything I need
to know about you or Donnie...

57:10.722 --> 57:13.976
or Donnie's wife
or the victim?

57:14.017 --> 57:16.478
No.

57:16.562 --> 57:18.856
Will that be all?

57:20.023 --> 57:21.984
Yes, ma'am.

57:24.778 --> 57:28.198
You know, Mr. Duncan,

57:28.282 --> 57:31.743
the victim had a name.

57:31.827 --> 57:34.496
It was Jessica King.

57:38.333 --> 57:39.918
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you
worked out at AyJay's?

57:39.918 --> 57:42.087
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you
worked out at AyJay's?

57:42.171 --> 57:44.089
About ten years.

57:44.173 --> 57:47.718
Now, were you working at AyJay's
on Saturday night, April 8?

57:47.801 --> 57:50.345
- Yes, sir.
- And did you see the defendant,

57:50.429 --> 57:54.183
- Donnie Barksdale, there that night?
- Yes, sir.

57:54.266 --> 57:57.019
Could you describe the circumstances
when you saw him?

57:57.060 --> 58:01.857
The circumstances were I come
outside to throw out some trash.

58:01.899 --> 58:03.859
And do you recall
what time it was?

58:03.901 --> 58:06.195
About midnight,
I reckon.

58:06.278 --> 58:09.823
Anyhow, I seen Donnie Barksdale
out there by his truck...

58:09.907 --> 58:13.827
havin' an argument
with this white lady.

58:13.869 --> 58:18.665
She scratched his arm
and he slapped the tar out of her.

58:18.707 --> 58:21.543
About that time,
I go back inside.

58:21.627 --> 58:23.962
Is this the woman
you saw with Donnie Barksdale?

58:24.046 --> 58:27.257
- Yes, sir.
- Your Honor, let the record show...

58:27.341 --> 58:31.345
that I've just shown Mr. Hawkins
a photograph of Jessica King.

58:33.847 --> 58:39.019
You just said that your attention
was drawn to the defendant's pond.

58:40.354 --> 58:43.357
Drawn in...
Well, drawn in what way?

58:44.733 --> 58:47.569
Me, Wayne Collins
and Kenneth King...

58:47.611 --> 58:49.571
went to see a woman,
name of Annie Wilson.

58:49.613 --> 58:52.074
What made you think this woman
would be able to help you?

58:52.115 --> 58:57.913
Well, word around town
was that she was a...

59:00.833 --> 59:04.878
- Well, I don't know the right word.
- Isn't it fortune-teller?

59:06.672 --> 59:08.924
- I guess so.
- What did this fortune-teller see...

59:09.007 --> 59:11.969
when she looked into
her little crystal ball?

59:12.010 --> 59:16.849
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these, special cards.

59:16.932 --> 59:20.185
What did she see when she looked
into her little special cards?

59:20.269 --> 59:22.521
She didn't actually
see nothing then.

59:22.604 --> 59:26.108
But next day,
she come to see me and...

59:26.191 --> 59:28.068
told me
she had this dream.

59:28.152 --> 59:31.155
- She had a dream?
- Yes, sir.

59:31.238 --> 59:35.450
She'd seen this pond and it looked
a lot like Donnie Barksdale's and...

59:37.035 --> 59:39.621
then she woke up
from her dream...

59:39.705 --> 59:42.749
and she went outside
and looked up in this tree.

59:45.794 --> 59:47.796
I'm all ears.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.887
She seen Jessica King...

59:54.970 --> 59:57.598
floatin' in the tree,

59:57.681 --> 01:00:00.476
half-naked, with a chain
wrapped around her.

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.936
Floatin' around a tree?

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:06.356
Yes, sir.

01:00:07.858 --> 01:00:09.818
Floatin' in a tree,

01:00:09.902 --> 01:00:11.987
half-naked,

01:00:13.906 --> 01:00:16.200
with a chain
wrapped around her.

01:00:16.241 --> 01:00:18.577
Thank you, Sheriff.

01:00:20.078 --> 01:00:22.581
That little squirrel,
Weems, is just mean and skinny.

01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:25.167
Never have known
a Weems worth a damn.

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.127
Well, he was
just doing his job.

01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:31.048
Mrs. Wilson?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:00:31.089 --> 01:00:34.426
Just call me later on, okay?

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.428
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, bye.

01:00:36.512 --> 01:00:41.141
Buddy, I got a lot on my mind.
It's not a good time, okay?

01:00:43.477 --> 01:00:45.395
Mrs. Wilson?

01:00:45.479 --> 01:00:49.525
You did tell me to do some thinkin'
and talkin'. And I've been thinkin'.

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:51.401
What? What?

01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:55.322
Can you tell me why
I do things to myself...

01:00:55.405 --> 01:00:57.324
when I think
about my daddy?

01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:59.493
All right, well...

01:00:59.576 --> 01:01:03.789
Bud, you call me later, hon,
and we'll talk, all right?

01:01:03.872 --> 01:01:06.667
- I need to talk to you.
- Buddy.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.670
I've been thinking about my daddy
and I've been touching myself.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:12.673
- Touching yourself? How?
- Why do I do that?

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.299
It's not a good time.

01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:17.636
- Something's bad wrong with me.
- Look, Buddy...

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:20.681
And I... I keep thinking
about that blue diamond.

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:24.560
You look into the blue diamond,
you won't think a negative thought.

01:01:24.643 --> 01:01:28.438
I promise. Now, hon, I'm going
through a hard time myself. I'm...

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.775
I just... I can't talk
to you now, okay?

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:37.739
You're gonna burn
in hell, Annie Wilson!

01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:51.587
Now, Mike, I know you skipped
school and went to that trial.

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:54.756
- How'd you know?
- A little bird told me.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.051
It's time you started making things
easier on me instead of harder.

01:01:58.135 --> 01:02:00.053
I'm very disappointed in you.

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:03.599
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- Second of all,

01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:06.477
I'm gonna have to testify
at that trial tomorrow.

01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:09.354
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- I'm not deaf, Miller.

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:11.607
Let the machine get it.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.611
Donnie Barksdale's side, they're
gonna try and give me a hard time.

01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:18.280
They're gonna call me names
and I...

01:02:18.322 --> 01:02:20.282
I just want y'all
to be prepared...

01:02:20.324 --> 01:02:23.619
if you hear any bad stuff
about me, all right?

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:27.164
Now, we're all gonna have to
be sticking together on this one.

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:30.000
Annie Wilson, it's Buddy's mother.

01:02:30.042 --> 01:02:32.628
Buddy's done gone crazy.
He's threatening to kill his daddy!

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:36.548
He's got Odell tied up
in the backyard,

01:02:36.632 --> 01:02:38.634
accusing him
of horrible things.

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:42.179
- Have you called the police?
- He said if I did he'd kill Odell.

01:02:42.221 --> 01:02:44.515
He wants you.

01:02:46.558 --> 01:02:49.269
Hey, Buddy.

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:55.984
Buddy, put that strap down and
tell me what he's done to you.

01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:59.279
I'm here, Buddy. Like you said,
you can talk to me, honey.

01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:04.701
It's too late for that!
It's too goddamn late!

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:08.539
This here is a criminal.

01:03:10.624 --> 01:03:13.126
And he's gonna be punished.

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.671
Bud-Buddy.
Buddy, it's Annie.

01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:18.841
- You shut up! You shut up!
- It's all right.

01:03:18.924 --> 01:03:22.970
- Get away! Where were you?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:23.053 --> 01:03:27.474
You knew everything
and you did nothing.

01:03:27.558 --> 01:03:30.310
You ruined me.
You ruined me!

01:03:32.229 --> 01:03:34.064
I was just a little boy, Daddy.

01:03:34.106 --> 01:03:37.609
It got so I was embarrassed
to go to school, Daddy.

01:03:37.693 --> 01:03:40.445
How could you do that
to your little boy?

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:55.502
No, Buddy. You put that down.
No, Buddy.

01:03:55.586 --> 01:03:58.547
You put that down, Buddy.
You put that down. You listen to me.

01:03:58.589 --> 01:04:01.842
You get away!
You get away! Get away!

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:06.305
All right, Buddy. All right.
It's all right. Come on.

01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:10.100
Why... Why didn't
you help me, Annie?

01:04:10.142 --> 01:04:11.935
What?

01:04:11.977 --> 01:04:14.730
Why didn't you
help me?

01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:18.358
- I had you for a friend and then...
- I am your friend, Buddy.

01:04:18.442 --> 01:04:21.111
Now I have nobody.

01:04:21.153 --> 01:04:23.113
I have nobody!

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.627
But I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill this thing.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:40.088
- No!
- No, Buddy!

01:04:45.177 --> 01:04:46.595
No!

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.431
Help me!

01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:52.684
- Help me!
- Look at that goddamn thing.

01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:54.978
And you tell me what kind
of thoughts you have?

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.065
You look!

01:04:58.148 --> 01:05:00.067
You look
into that thing!

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:24.675
Mrs. Wilson? Mrs. Wilson.

01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:29.221
Mrs. Wilson, your husband,
Ben Wilson Senior,

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.765
was one of the men killed last year
in the explosion...

01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:33.767
out at the Reinhold
Cable Plant.

01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:35.936
Yes, that's right.

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:39.439
And you were left with three small
children to raise on your own.

01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:41.984
Yes, sir.

01:05:42.067 --> 01:05:44.486
How do you provide
for you and your sons?

01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:51.827
I get a little bit
of money from Social Security...

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:53.829
as a result
of my husband's death.

01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:58.959
And,

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.295
I also give readings.

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:03.380
- Psychic readings.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:06.425
What does being psychic
enable you to do?

01:06:08.427 --> 01:06:10.637
I see things...

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:14.141
and I, you know...
I sense... things...

01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:16.310
that... well, they
hadn't happened yet...

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:19.563
or they were happening
someplace else.

01:06:19.646 --> 01:06:24.818
My granny told me that I...
I had a gift that runs in my family.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.154
And she told me that
I shouldn't be afraid of it.

01:06:27.237 --> 01:06:32.326
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd... I'd be all right.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:34.411
So, you're swearing
before this court...

01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:36.663
that you didn't get your information
about this tragedy...

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:39.583
from any other means
than your special ability?

01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:42.628
- Your gift.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:45.464
I'm swearing that. Yes.

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:48.509
- Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:51.303
- I have no further questions.
- Mr. Weems.

01:06:56.225 --> 01:06:57.684
Mrs. Wilson.

01:07:01.605 --> 01:07:04.149
How many fingers am I holding up
behind my back?

01:07:04.233 --> 01:07:06.193
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Your Honor,

01:07:06.235 --> 01:07:08.987
my client is sitting in this
courtroom on trial for his life...

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:12.533
partly because of powers
that this woman claims to have.

01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:15.536
Now, in all fairness, I believe
I should be given the opportunity...

01:07:15.619 --> 01:07:17.538
to test
the alleged powers...

01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:20.165
instead of having to stand here
and take her word for it.

01:07:20.249 --> 01:07:23.669
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.

01:07:23.752 --> 01:07:29.132
Can everyone in the jury box
see how many fingers I'm showing?

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:35.806
How many fingers,
Mrs. Wilson?

01:07:41.478 --> 01:07:43.397
I don't know.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.691
You don't know?

01:07:48.277 --> 01:07:51.697
Seven.
Seven fingers.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.408
That... That doesn't
prove anything.

01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:57.619
Your Honor, I can't do this,
you know, at the drop of a hat.

01:07:57.703 --> 01:08:02.082
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing
it at the drop of a dollar bill?

01:08:02.124 --> 01:08:04.418
What are you trying to say?

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:06.879
I'm trying to say maybe this special
gift of yours doesn't work...

01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:09.673
unless you're
being paid for it.

01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:12.176
Like they say in the army,
''No money, no honey.''

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:14.219
No, that's not true.

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:16.220
Are you aware that in Hatcher County
it's against the law...

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:18.432
for a psychic to set up shop
and charge people money?

01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:20.517
Well, I don't charge money.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.560
You just testified
that you do charge money.

01:08:22.644 --> 01:08:26.023
No. I accept donations.
People give me gifts.

01:08:26.106 --> 01:08:30.777
Oh. A distinction
worthy of a lawyer.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:33.322
Mrs. Wilson,
you a rich woman?

01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:35.407
- No.
- Why not?

01:08:35.491 --> 01:08:40.412
If I had psychic powers and could
read the future, I'd be filthy rich.

01:08:40.496 --> 01:08:42.413
I'd be playing
the Stock Market.

01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:45.459
I'd be over in Mobile
betting on the dogs.

01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:47.794
I'd certainly warn my husband
not to go to work...

01:08:47.836 --> 01:08:50.296
on the day I know the Reinhold
Plant's gonna blow up...

01:08:50.339 --> 01:08:54.593
leaving three little ol' children
to be raised in a carnival sideshow.

01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:57.970
Well, it doesn't work
that way, sir.

01:08:58.013 --> 01:08:59.973
I can't use my gift
for personal gain.

01:09:00.057 --> 01:09:05.312
Except for those,
what you call 'em, donations?

01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:13.569
You've had some personal trouble
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you?

01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:20.743
Yes, I have.

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:23.663
Just a few weeks ago, you told him...
I believe the exact words was...

01:09:23.705 --> 01:09:25.999
you was gonna have
his ass thrown in jail.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:28.836
- But he was threatening my kids.
- Ain't it also true...

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:31.839
that a few weeks ago in one of
those famous readings of yours,

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.841
when you were doing
your so-called E.S.P.,

01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:36.176
you told Valerie Barksdale,
Donnie's wife,

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.636
that Donnie was just
an insecure redneck...

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.640
and that he wasn't really
crazy enough to kill anybody?

01:09:48.397 --> 01:09:50.357
Yes, I did say that.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.651
Then why today are you
saying he did kill somebody?

01:09:52.693 --> 01:09:54.653
Wait a second.
I've never said that.

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:57.239
You might as well have, ma'am.
You wanted his ass in jail.

01:09:57.322 --> 01:10:00.701
- He's on trial for his life.
- I just told the sheriff what I saw.

01:10:00.742 --> 01:10:04.329
And how could any of us
ever forget that?

01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:08.208
Jessica King just
floatin' up in that tree,

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.794
naked,

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:13.338
with a chain...

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:15.382
wrapped around her.

01:10:17.134 --> 01:10:20.804
It must be
so much fun for you.

01:10:20.888 --> 01:10:23.056
You must be having
the time of your life...

01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:26.185
entertaining yourself
with your dreams and your visions.

01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:29.855
You think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir?

01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:31.857
You think that's fun?

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.319
Do you think it's fun I have people
trying to strangle me in my sleep?

01:10:35.402 --> 01:10:37.571
Now I'm sitting here
and I'm blaming myself...

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:40.073
'cause some poor crazy man tried
to burn his daddy half to death.

01:10:40.115 --> 01:10:42.075
And you think I'm sitting here
having fun?

01:10:42.117 --> 01:10:44.912
I'm sorry, sir.
You're crazy if you think that.

01:10:44.995 --> 01:10:47.748
No more questions,
Your Honor.

01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:51.251
You're dismissed.

01:11:04.306 --> 01:11:06.892
Like they say in Hollywood,
let's just cut to the chase.

01:11:06.975 --> 01:11:10.187
Did you or did you not
kill Jessica King?

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.189
I did not.

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:15.901
Did you or did you not see Jessica
King on the night she was killed?

01:11:15.984 --> 01:11:19.238
Yeah, I seen her.

01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:21.782
Would you describe
the circumstances, please?

01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:24.618
Well, I'd been seeing her
for quite a while.

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:28.121
Would you clarify what
you mean by "seeing"?

01:11:28.163 --> 01:11:31.625
I mean, her and me
had been having sex.

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:35.379
Okay, go ahead.

01:11:35.462 --> 01:11:37.714
Well, she called me
about 11:00.

01:11:37.798 --> 01:11:41.635
So I told her
I'd meet her out at Ay Jay's.

01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:44.263
And I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.

01:11:44.346 --> 01:11:47.724
- What happened after that?
- Well, we got in an argument.

01:11:47.808 --> 01:11:49.726
She told me she didn't
want to see me no more.

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:52.479
- Did she tell you why?
- She said she was getting married...

01:11:52.563 --> 01:11:55.149
in a couple of months and she
wanted to stop playing around.

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:58.402
At least
till after the wedding.

01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:00.404
And during the course
of this argument with Miss King,

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:02.489
did you at any moment
strike her?

01:12:05.659 --> 01:12:07.619
Yes, sir.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.834
What happened
after you struck her?

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:16.587
Well, she banged her head
pretty hard when she went down,

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.882
so I... I decided
to take her to the hospital.

01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:23.010
- Did you reach the hospital?
- No, sir.

01:12:23.093 --> 01:12:25.012
Are you feeling okay?

01:12:26.972 --> 01:12:28.891
I'm fine.

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:32.311
I wanna go back.

01:12:32.394 --> 01:12:34.938
I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone...

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:36.940
Someone might see me.

01:12:37.024 --> 01:12:41.111
She said she was feeling better,
so I took her back to Ay Jay's.

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:45.532
I dropped her off,
then I went on back home.

01:12:45.574 --> 01:12:50.037
And that was the very last time
that you saw Jessica King alive?

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.123
- Yes, sir. The very last.
- Donnie,

01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:56.502
are you guilty
of the charge against you?

01:12:58.212 --> 01:13:00.464
I'm guilty
of cheating on my wife,

01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:03.008
of being a bad husband,

01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:05.594
a bad Christian.

01:13:05.677 --> 01:13:08.138
But I ain't guilty
of killing Jesse.

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.641
I swear to God.

01:13:10.724 --> 01:13:14.019
No more questions,
Your Honor.

01:13:14.102 --> 01:13:15.437
Mr. Duncan.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:20.067
Mr. Barksdale,
you're a wife-beater, aren't you?

01:13:23.862 --> 01:13:26.824
I've swore to tell
the truth here today.

01:13:26.865 --> 01:13:31.161
Yeah, I've hit
Valerie before.

01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:33.664
I guess
it ain't no secret.

01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:36.875
So, you admit to having a history
of violence against women?

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:38.794
You also admit to having
beaten up the victim...

01:13:38.877 --> 01:13:40.462
on the night
that she was murdered.

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.506
I wouldn't exactly say
that I beat her up.

01:13:42.548 --> 01:13:44.925
You're the expert. You tell me.
Just how badly do you...

01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:49.263
have to beat a woman before it fits
your definition of ''beating up''?

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:53.058
Now, your story is that you've
been having an affair...

01:13:53.142 --> 01:13:55.978
with the victim.

01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:59.439
But tell us why a beautiful
young woman like Jessica King...

01:13:59.523 --> 01:14:01.441
from one of the finest
families in Brixton,

01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:04.653
just about to be married to a good,
decent professional man...

01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:07.447
and with a bright,
shining future in front of her...

01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:10.701
Why would a woman like that get
involved with something like you?

01:14:10.784 --> 01:14:14.997
I asked her that
myself one time.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.292
She said I was the only man
in town who knew how to fuck.

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:23.338
You're really disgusting.
You know that?

01:14:23.422 --> 01:14:26.675
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection sustained.

01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:29.845
Mr. Duncan, you will refrain from
making those personal comments.

01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:32.890
I apologize, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:38.228
So, let's get this straight.
Let's clarify this.

01:14:38.312 --> 01:14:40.731
You're saying it was
just a coincidence...

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:44.401
that on the very same night that you
physically assaulted Jessica King,

01:14:44.485 --> 01:14:46.612
someone else put
her body in your pond?

01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:48.989
I'm not saying
it was a coincidence.

01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:51.658
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I got framed!

01:14:51.742 --> 01:14:53.911
Oh, well, what an original defense.

01:14:53.994 --> 01:14:56.371
Did you think of Jessica King
as a stray cat?

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:57.998
No.

01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:00.334
Did you tell Sheriff Johnson that
a stray cat had clawed your arm?

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:02.336
- Yeah.
- Didn't you just tell the court...

01:15:02.419 --> 01:15:04.338
- Jessica had scratched your arm?
- Yeah, but...

01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:07.382
Didn't you tell Sheriff Johnson you
got scratched by the stray cat...

01:15:07.466 --> 01:15:09.426
because she didn't like it
when you killed her?

01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:11.845
Yeah, but I was lying.
My wife was standing right there!

01:15:11.929 --> 01:15:14.765
- How do I know you're not lying now?
- Because I'm not, goddamn it!

01:15:14.848 --> 01:15:17.309
- It's her, goddamn it!
- Be seated, Mr. Barksdale!

01:15:17.392 --> 01:15:19.520
She's the reason I'm up here!
She's a goddamn witch!

01:15:19.603 --> 01:15:23.232
She's putting spells on
every-goddamn-body in town!

01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:26.151
Witch! Witch!
Yeah, you run!

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:28.278
I'll have order in the courtroom.

01:15:28.362 --> 01:15:32.699
In Brixton today, a sensational
murder trial was concluded.

01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:35.410
Donald J. Barksdale
was found guilty...

01:15:35.494 --> 01:15:38.622
in the sex and strangulation
killing of Jessica King,

01:15:38.705 --> 01:15:43.210
daughter of the prominent Brixton
businessman, Kenneth King.

01:15:43.293 --> 01:15:46.380
Is everything gonna be
all right now, Mama?

01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:48.882
Yeah, hon.

01:15:48.966 --> 01:15:51.677
We can get on
with our lives now.

01:16:45.063 --> 01:16:47.399
I guess I'm the last
person you wanna see.

01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:53.864
How you been?

01:16:57.826 --> 01:16:59.745
Terrible.

01:17:01.622 --> 01:17:05.083
Annie, if you tell me to get going,
I will. I wouldn't blame you.

01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:07.669
But I need you
to read for me.

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.721
Give me a hand.

01:17:20.724 --> 01:17:24.478
I feel like I can't
hold on any longer.

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:29.358
I know Donnie's mean and everything,
but I feel real lost without him.

01:17:29.399 --> 01:17:32.402
You know, I ain't never
been on my own before.

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:35.614
And I'm scared, Annie.

01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:39.451
You don't need to be scared, hon.
You'll be fine.

01:17:41.578 --> 01:17:43.622
You see that
in the cards?

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.500
Right through here.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.795
But can you see
what... what I'm thinking?

01:17:49.878 --> 01:17:53.090
Can you see that
in the cards?

01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:55.133
What do you mean?

01:17:55.217 --> 01:17:57.553
Well,

01:17:57.636 --> 01:18:02.641
I've been thinking
some real bad, bad thoughts.

01:18:02.724 --> 01:18:05.686
Unchristian thoughts.

01:18:05.769 --> 01:18:08.147
Like what?

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.606
Like...

01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:14.486
I'm glad that girl's dead.
Jessica.

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:17.614
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.

01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:19.616
No one deserves that.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.162
Like I said,
I know it's unchristian.

01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:33.672
What? What, are you
seeing something bad?

01:18:36.091 --> 01:18:38.010
I don't know.

01:18:43.807 --> 01:18:46.185
It's not clear.

01:20:22.865 --> 01:20:25.200
Fuck you!

01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.202
Wayne?

01:21:19.171 --> 01:21:21.089
Wayne?

01:21:41.777 --> 01:21:44.279
It's not normally
like this.

01:21:49.785 --> 01:21:53.330
You need
to lie down.

01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:55.457
I'm really not sleepy.

01:21:55.541 --> 01:21:59.044
I think if you sleep,
you'll feel better.

01:22:12.224 --> 01:22:14.184
Thank you, Annie.

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:18.522
Oh. It's okay.

01:22:40.419 --> 01:22:42.337
Wayne.

01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:47.426
I don't think
this is a good idea.

01:22:49.136 --> 01:22:51.054
No.

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.058
It's not.

01:22:57.394 --> 01:23:00.355
I just thought we could
forget all this for a while.

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:05.027
You want to,
don't you?

01:23:21.585 --> 01:23:24.171
I know there's
something between us.

01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:32.221
I can't.

01:23:33.931 --> 01:23:36.433
I guess
I still feel married.

01:23:39.228 --> 01:23:41.188
You're not, though.

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:46.902
- He's gone.
- I know.

01:23:48.195 --> 01:23:50.531
You gotta learn
to deal with that.

01:23:53.325 --> 01:23:57.663
The same way I gotta learn to deal
with the fact that Jessica's gone.

01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:05.045
She's dead.

01:24:06.922 --> 01:24:09.424
Oh, Wayne,
I'm so sorry.

01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:14.221
It's okay.

01:24:14.263 --> 01:24:16.765
No, it's not okay.

01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:23.814
I... I don't think
Donnie Barksdale killed her.

01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:27.901
- No, no, Annie.
- I'm really sorry.

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:30.362
I can't... I can't do this.
It's finished.

01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:33.824
I know. I wanna let
that bastard rot in jail.

01:24:33.907 --> 01:24:36.577
- But he's guilty.
- No, Wayne.

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.620
I see it.

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:44.084
I see he didn't do it.

01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:52.092
- Do you see who did?
- I'm trying, but I... I...

01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:54.136
I don't know yet.

01:24:54.178 --> 01:24:56.889
What are we gonna do?

01:24:58.348 --> 01:25:01.226
Well, if I had
a piece of clothing...

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:05.939
or maybe I could go
out to the pond or see if I...

01:25:07.524 --> 01:25:12.196
It's not over.
Jesus.

01:26:54.965 --> 01:26:56.800
Come on in.

01:27:00.679 --> 01:27:04.475
Well,
what brings you out here?

01:27:06.018 --> 01:27:08.896
Well, I'll just come
straight out and say it.

01:27:08.979 --> 01:27:11.356
I don't think Donnie Barksdale
killed Jessica King.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.400
Well, sure he did.
It was an open-and-shut case.

01:27:13.484 --> 01:27:15.027
I'm telling you he didn't.

01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:17.738
The person that killed Jessica
is still out there someplace.

01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:20.032
What's the deal? The Barksdales
been threatening you?

01:27:20.115 --> 01:27:22.284
- No.
- I'll talk to Pearl Johnson.

01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:25.871
This has nothing to do
with the Barksdales. Listen.

01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:27.915
I know that Donnie
didn't kill Jessica...

01:27:27.998 --> 01:27:30.542
the same way that I knew
that her body was in his pond.

01:27:30.626 --> 01:27:34.630
And do you know
who did kill her?

01:27:37.508 --> 01:27:39.426
No.

01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.720
So, what do you care?
The son of a bitch is in jail.

01:27:41.804 --> 01:27:44.515
I got a warning today.

01:27:44.598 --> 01:27:47.392
I think somebody is
gonna try and kill me.

01:27:47.476 --> 01:27:49.394
What do you
want me to do?

01:27:49.478 --> 01:27:51.396
Reopen the case and find out
who really did it.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.316
- I can't. He's been convicted.
- Well, you can talk to somebody.

01:27:54.358 --> 01:27:56.318
I've got no basis to open this case.
I'd look like a fool.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.363
I don't give a damn
how you look.

01:27:59.404 --> 01:28:01.490
Now, you listen to me.

01:28:01.532 --> 01:28:04.868
I know you had
an affair with Jessica.

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:07.955
So how do you think you're
gonna look if people find out...

01:28:08.038 --> 01:28:11.792
you had sex with the victim
the night before she was killed?

01:28:36.733 --> 01:28:38.819
Do you want money?

01:28:41.738 --> 01:28:45.159
No. I want you
to reopen the case.

01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:51.832
There's a saying about
letting sleeping dogs lie.

01:28:51.915 --> 01:28:55.794
You think you're in danger now?
Look at it logically.

01:28:55.878 --> 01:28:59.506
The real danger begins if this case
gets reopened and someone starts...

01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:02.050
worrying that you're gonna have
another one of your damn dreams.

01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:17.733
All I know is,
the wrong man's in jail.

01:29:17.774 --> 01:29:20.944
I don't care how awful he is.
And I helped put him there.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.616
I can't live
with something like that.

01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:30.954
So you find a way
to reopen this case, sir.

01:29:31.038 --> 01:29:32.956
Or I will.

01:30:08.992 --> 01:30:11.328
Buddy!

01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:21.130
Buddy, I'm here if you...

01:30:48.073 --> 01:30:50.200
- Hello.
- Hi, Miss Francis. I'm back.

01:30:50.284 --> 01:30:52.202
- Good.
- How are the boys?

01:30:52.286 --> 01:30:54.746
They're fine. They went to sleep.
You want me to bring 'em over?

01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:57.833
No. No. Listen.

01:30:57.875 --> 01:31:00.169
Could we stay over
your house tonight?

01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:03.380
- Sure you can. You all right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

01:31:03.464 --> 01:31:06.383
Come over. I'll make a bed for you.

01:31:06.425 --> 01:31:09.011
- All right. I'm just gonna lock up.
- Okay, doll.

01:31:09.094 --> 01:31:11.054
- Okay, thank you.
- Bye-bye.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.739
Buddy!

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:35.078
Oh! Did you see
Buddy Cole?

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:38.207
Buddy? No. I thought he was
at the hospital over in Benton?

01:31:38.248 --> 01:31:41.627
- Oh, he is. Maybe I imagined it.
- Are you okay?

01:31:41.710 --> 01:31:43.629
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:31:43.712 --> 01:31:48.175
Ever since you told me what you told
me, I feel like I'm going crazy.

01:31:48.258 --> 01:31:50.636
Annie, I can't stand
another night of this.

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.679
I need you
to read for me.

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:03.816
It's no good.

01:32:05.609 --> 01:32:08.946
- Try it again.
- I can't make it happen.

01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:19.081
How about
what you said today?

01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:21.124
What?

01:32:22.584 --> 01:32:24.503
The pond.

01:32:24.586 --> 01:32:27.756
What if we did
go back out there?

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.801
Do you think
it might help you?

01:32:30.843 --> 01:32:32.803
I... I...

01:32:32.845 --> 01:32:35.389
I don't know.
Yeah. Maybe.

01:32:35.472 --> 01:32:38.100
Yeah, okay. Well,
it's worth a try, right?

01:32:38.183 --> 01:32:41.353
You mean tonight? No, Wayne.
I can't... I can't do that.

01:32:41.436 --> 01:32:43.897
I got my kids. It's dark.

01:32:43.981 --> 01:32:46.608
You know, it's... it is a pol...
it's a police matter now.

01:32:46.650 --> 01:32:49.236
How long do you think
that's gonna take, Annie?

01:32:49.319 --> 01:32:53.115
It's gonna sit on somebody's desk
for months. Nothing's gonna happen.

01:32:53.157 --> 01:32:55.242
It's over for them. They've got
their man. It's up to us.

01:32:55.325 --> 01:32:58.745
I know that, Wayne. But I'm
telling you, I don't see anything.

01:33:03.959 --> 01:33:06.253
I can't keep running
from things.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.556
Maybe if you just
sort of walk around.

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.558
All right.

01:34:43.433 --> 01:34:45.352
Oh, shoot!

01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:00.159
Jeez, you all right?
You okay?

01:35:00.242 --> 01:35:02.161
Yeah.

01:35:05.706 --> 01:35:07.624
Yeah.

01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:44.870
What are you
doing here?

01:35:52.044 --> 01:35:54.046
You seeing something?

01:36:03.388 --> 01:36:07.434
I've been thinking
some real bad, bad thoughts.

01:36:07.518 --> 01:36:08.769
Annie?

01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:12.064
I'm glad that girl is dead.
Jessica.

01:36:12.147 --> 01:36:15.317
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.

01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:22.783
I couldn't sleep.
Met the girls for a drink.

01:36:24.201 --> 01:36:26.328
Take off your clothes.

01:36:32.543 --> 01:36:35.546
Aren't you taking yours off too?

01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:39.341
There's a saying
about letting sleeping dogs lie.

01:36:40.551 --> 01:36:44.680
You just fucked him,
didn't you?

01:36:46.974 --> 01:36:49.893
Donnie Barksdale?

01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:53.021
So?

01:36:53.063 --> 01:36:56.733
Why would you do this to me?
I love you.

01:36:56.817 --> 01:36:58.986
Maybe I wanted to be
with a man for a change.

01:36:59.069 --> 01:37:01.488
- Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth. Fuck you!

01:37:01.572 --> 01:37:04.366
- I'm sorry.
- We're through.

01:37:04.408 --> 01:37:07.161
I don't like being spied on.

01:37:07.244 --> 01:37:10.497
The only reason I'm with you
is 'cause my daddy likes you.

01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:15.002
You horrible little bitch!

01:37:15.085 --> 01:37:17.838
I'll show you a bitch if you
don't let go of me. Let go!

01:37:39.943 --> 01:37:42.279
- I think we better go back.
- Nothing's coming to you?

01:37:44.281 --> 01:37:46.241
No.

01:37:46.283 --> 01:37:48.535
Nothing.

01:37:57.461 --> 01:37:59.379
You know.

01:38:02.257 --> 01:38:06.053
I knew if I got you close enough
to it that you'd see it.

01:38:06.136 --> 01:38:09.473
- Wayne, I told you...
- No, no. It's okay.

01:38:09.556 --> 01:38:11.767
I swear to God, Annie,
it's okay. It's okay.

01:38:11.809 --> 01:38:13.811
I wanted you to.
I swear to God.

01:38:13.894 --> 01:38:17.856
I wanted you to see it so bad.
I mean, that's why we're here.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.484
I'm not some killer, Annie.
I'm not.

01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:23.821
You don't... I mean, do you know
what it was like with her?

01:38:23.904 --> 01:38:27.574
She was so fucking hurtful
and spiteful and all of it...

01:38:27.658 --> 01:38:29.243
Wayne, I'm not gonna...

01:38:29.326 --> 01:38:31.995
But all of it just happened
in this flash of a moment.

01:38:32.079 --> 01:38:35.541
- Wayne, I...
- Listen to me. I'm a good man.

01:38:35.624 --> 01:38:38.877
If it had been you instead of her,
none of this would have happened.

01:38:38.961 --> 01:38:41.130
Wayne.

01:38:44.007 --> 01:38:45.968
It's all right, you know?

01:38:46.009 --> 01:38:49.263
I won't... I won't tell.

01:38:52.349 --> 01:38:55.477
I won't...
I won't tell anybody.

01:38:57.187 --> 01:38:59.231
No, Annie...

01:40:12.888 --> 01:40:15.224
You all right, Mrs. Wilson?

01:41:04.106 --> 01:41:07.985
I thought you were supposed to
be in the hospital.

01:41:08.068 --> 01:41:11.822
I escaped, Mrs. Wilson.

01:41:11.905 --> 01:41:14.283
I'm free.

01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:18.620
Buddy, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there for you.

01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:23.375
- I should've...
- Now, don't you say another word.

01:41:26.587 --> 01:41:30.299
You was the only one
that was a friend to me.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.760
And I love you.

01:41:37.264 --> 01:41:40.893
You're the soul
of this town, Mrs. Wilson.

01:41:40.976 --> 01:41:45.105
And you just need to keep doing
what you're doing.

01:42:00.454 --> 01:42:02.372
I washed it.

01:42:17.638 --> 01:42:20.015
Will you come back
into town with me?

01:42:20.098 --> 01:42:22.017
Yeah.

01:42:37.866 --> 01:42:41.203
You know you're
gonna have to go back.

01:42:43.038 --> 01:42:45.624
Yes, ma'am, I know.

01:43:18.574 --> 01:43:20.534
Can I have your keys,
ma'am?

01:43:43.182 --> 01:43:44.266
Well,

01:43:44.475 --> 01:43:47.728
I just talked to Wayne.

01:43:47.769 --> 01:43:50.772
He pretty much admitted
to everything.

01:43:50.856 --> 01:43:55.235
I've known that boy
half my life.

01:43:58.906 --> 01:44:01.825
It just goes to show,
you can know somebody and...

01:44:05.579 --> 01:44:07.498
not know 'em.

01:44:10.125 --> 01:44:13.545
How's his...
How's his head?

01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:15.756
Well, you put
a pretty good dent in it.

01:44:15.798 --> 01:44:18.717
Oh, no, Sheriff,
I told...

01:44:18.801 --> 01:44:20.969
I told the deputy
it wasn't me who did that.

01:44:21.053 --> 01:44:24.097
It was...
It was Buddy Cole. He saved me.

01:44:24.181 --> 01:44:27.226
- No, ma'am. It weren't Buddy.
- Well, yes, it was.

01:44:27.309 --> 01:44:30.813
- Why don't you just ask Wayne?
- I did.

01:44:30.896 --> 01:44:33.232
He don't remember
what happened.

01:44:33.315 --> 01:44:35.567
Head injuries is funny.

01:44:35.651 --> 01:44:40.781
- I'm telling you, it was Buddy Cole.
- What I'm tryin' to say is,

01:44:40.823 --> 01:44:43.158
it couldn't have been Buddy.

01:44:43.242 --> 01:44:45.702
I... I just called up
at the State Hospital.

01:44:45.786 --> 01:44:49.081
- He told me he escaped.
- Ma'am.

01:44:51.041 --> 01:44:53.168
Buddy Cole is dead.

01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:58.132
He hanged himself
in the shower room...

01:44:59.758 --> 01:45:01.677
6:00 this evening.
