WEBVTT

00:00.242 --> 00:01.906
Previously on "Bitten"...

00:02.164 --> 00:05.303
- What was that?
- Uh, wiring. It's fine.

00:05.328 --> 00:06.795
They know where we are. We have to move,

00:06.797 --> 00:09.064
- find another base.
- I have a place already.

00:09.066 --> 00:11.764
Katia and Alexei saw
their mother torn apart

00:11.789 --> 00:13.722
by a wolf with one red eye.

00:13.724 --> 00:14.757
Roman's assassins.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.690
It wasn't a dream, was it?

00:16.692 --> 00:19.593
That boy, he was
changing into something.

00:19.595 --> 00:22.896
God, did I see him...
change into a wolf?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.297
This is my responsibility.

00:24.299 --> 00:27.033
I'll figure it all out.

00:27.035 --> 00:29.603
What's happening there?

00:29.605 --> 00:31.104
I spoke to Jorge,

00:31.106 --> 00:32.973
he told me that you had him track Roman.

00:32.975 --> 00:35.409
He found a lot of credit cards
that lead to Southern Ontario.

00:35.411 --> 00:38.044
- Are you coming back?
- I am going to go after Roman.

00:38.046 --> 00:40.513
This is from the Russian wolf.
It's infected.

00:40.515 --> 00:41.982
I can turn around. We can be there

00:41.984 --> 00:43.383
in an hour and a half, tops.

00:43.385 --> 00:44.885
- Rachel isn't answering?
- No.

00:44.887 --> 00:47.653
- Go to Rachel's.
- I found this at the front gate.

00:49.892 --> 00:52.359
That's Marsten.

00:52.361 --> 00:55.628
Please, enough...
enough!

01:26.660 --> 01:28.727
Rachel?

01:33.400 --> 01:34.733
Rachel?

01:38.271 --> 01:39.971
Maybe she left.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.311
Rachel.

01:54.754 --> 01:56.887
Something's not right.

02:04.697 --> 02:06.063
Rachel.

02:06.065 --> 02:08.164
- Oh, thank God.
- What's going on?

02:09.568 --> 02:10.800
Who is this?

02:14.474 --> 02:16.806
Uh, it's fine. This is...

02:16.808 --> 02:18.141
This is Katia.

02:19.678 --> 02:21.345
I'm Elena's half-sister.

02:24.549 --> 02:26.783
It's a long story.

02:32.724 --> 02:33.923
It's just for a few days.

02:33.925 --> 02:36.125
She can stay in the spare room.

02:36.127 --> 02:38.394
- Who's after her?
- It's a bit of a situation,

02:38.396 --> 02:40.697
- but we're handling it.
- I can't be worrying

02:40.699 --> 02:43.299
- about men coming through the door.
- That's not going to happen.

02:43.301 --> 02:45.702
Nobody knows about this place.

02:45.704 --> 02:48.671
There's something wrong with Rocco.

02:48.673 --> 02:51.340
- What, like colic?
- I wish.

02:51.342 --> 02:53.309
This is much worse.

02:55.346 --> 02:56.645
I moved everything away

02:56.647 --> 02:58.580
to keep anything from falling on him.

02:58.582 --> 03:01.717
What would fall on him?
Everything's on the floor.

03:01.719 --> 03:03.419
It won't stay that way.

03:05.056 --> 03:07.956
Rachel, Rocco is fine.

03:07.958 --> 03:09.457
This is completely normal. Look,

03:09.459 --> 03:10.859
I've read about this in the books.

03:10.861 --> 03:13.194
The insomnia and the irrational fear...

03:13.196 --> 03:15.263
it's called postpartum anxiety.

03:15.265 --> 03:18.466
If you say it's hormones, I will punch
you in the nose, I swear to God.

03:22.672 --> 03:24.105
Aren't you going to go to him?

03:24.107 --> 03:25.473
Move back.

03:27.721 --> 03:29.754
Rachel, he's... hungry or wet.

03:29.779 --> 03:30.663
He needs you.

03:30.687 --> 03:33.314
You don't think there's
anything wrong with him?

03:33.316 --> 03:34.516
Just wait.

03:36.019 --> 03:37.818
What's going on?

03:37.820 --> 03:39.219
- All right...
- Nick!

04:07.716 --> 04:11.251
Ho-ly shit.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.858
It's okay, Rocco, it's okay.

04:26.401 --> 04:29.034
Still think it's postpartum anxiety?

05:02.510 --> 05:04.729

05:19.636 --> 05:22.904
Please, enough... enough!

05:26.342 --> 05:27.893
He's in the textile factory.

05:27.972 --> 05:30.038
We have to get a hold of Jeremy.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.608
Roman's obviously trying to draw us out.

05:32.610 --> 05:33.875
Wait.

05:45.589 --> 05:47.622
It's just one guy.

05:47.624 --> 05:49.924
One guy we can see.

05:49.926 --> 05:52.193
We have to save him.

05:52.195 --> 05:53.394
I-I agree,

05:53.396 --> 05:55.430
but that factory is huge.

05:55.432 --> 05:57.632
Who knows how many Russians
are waiting for us.

05:57.634 --> 06:00.101
I know. But it's Marsten.

06:01.303 --> 06:03.470
Why would we play right into his hands?

06:03.472 --> 06:05.305
We won't.

06:05.307 --> 06:06.841
They'll be expecting a show of force,

06:06.843 --> 06:08.809
but we'll go in quietly.

06:08.811 --> 06:11.045
It's too risky.

06:11.047 --> 06:12.747
None of us are worth saving

06:12.749 --> 06:14.848
unless we're all worth saving.

06:19.388 --> 06:21.054
Then we go get him.

06:53.488 --> 06:54.853
What can I get for you, friend?

06:54.855 --> 06:56.489
Glass of ice.

07:05.232 --> 07:08.801
You want anything in that glass
that I can charge you for?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.635
Just ice.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.242
You're not busy, eh?

07:17.244 --> 07:19.911
You kidding me? Three people
in here at the same time,

07:19.913 --> 07:22.614
- it's a stampede.
- You the owner?

07:22.616 --> 07:24.516
I am the sole proprietor.

07:24.518 --> 07:26.418
One employee, me.

07:27.654 --> 07:30.955
I like this place.

07:30.957 --> 07:33.091
You want to sell it to me?

07:33.093 --> 07:35.527
Son, you'd be buying a pig in a poke.

07:35.529 --> 07:37.862
Besides, this place is all I got left

07:37.864 --> 07:39.430
since the wife passed.

07:39.432 --> 07:42.867
Keeps me busy, even when it ain't busy.

07:42.869 --> 07:45.236
So... no sale?

07:47.406 --> 07:51.142
Nope. Sorry.

07:51.144 --> 07:53.844
You want to try the breakfast special?

07:57.550 --> 07:59.182
Let me ask you this.

07:59.184 --> 08:01.318
Those two, I saw their licence plates:

08:01.320 --> 08:04.221
one from Washington, the
other from Pennsylvania.

08:04.223 --> 08:07.190
Do you think anybody knows they're here?

08:07.192 --> 08:09.259
Drinking beer at 8:00 in the A.M.?

08:09.261 --> 08:11.928
I doubt it.

08:11.930 --> 08:14.197
I change my mind. I have coffee.

08:30.214 --> 08:32.515
Yeah, I'll just get the bill.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.488
I don't remember
inviting you to join us.

08:51.735 --> 08:53.435
What the hell?

08:58.809 --> 09:01.042
Ahh.

09:01.044 --> 09:02.877
Sit, sit.

09:02.879 --> 09:04.145
I have travelled a very long way

09:04.147 --> 09:05.681
to show you magic trick.

09:05.683 --> 09:06.915
Drinking a whole pot of coffee?

09:06.917 --> 09:09.651
No, no. Different trick.

09:09.653 --> 09:11.353
Hold this.

09:11.355 --> 09:12.887
No, both hands.

09:12.889 --> 09:14.323
Don't let go.

09:19.395 --> 09:22.163
This is called orbitoclast. Yes?

09:22.165 --> 09:25.300
You know what it's for?

09:25.302 --> 09:26.901
Lobotomies.

09:26.903 --> 09:28.736
Doctor puts this up
under your eye socket.

09:28.738 --> 09:30.238
Swish-swish...

09:30.240 --> 09:32.740
boom, you have lobotomy.

09:32.742 --> 09:34.375
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've
seen that in the movies.

09:34.377 --> 09:35.843
And I don't think
you're allowed to do it

09:35.845 --> 09:37.044
that way anymore though.

09:37.046 --> 09:38.546
This is true.

09:38.548 --> 09:40.113
You watch the bottom.

09:46.389 --> 09:47.955
I don't get it. What's the trick?

09:47.957 --> 09:49.456
He's dead.

09:59.768 --> 10:03.937
What in God's name did you do?

10:08.009 --> 10:09.976
I told you,

10:09.978 --> 10:11.911
I like this place.

10:22.023 --> 10:24.123
Rocco is sleeping.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.158
Good. Good.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.461
I've got to tell you, I'm
a little freaked out.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.798
- Yeah, it's a little freaky.
- What makes a baby werewolf

10:32.800 --> 10:35.334
- move things like that?
- Rachel went through a lot

10:35.336 --> 10:36.769
when she was pregnant.

10:36.771 --> 10:40.372
She was taken by a very... very bad man

10:40.374 --> 10:42.441
who injected her with witch's blood.

10:42.443 --> 10:43.942
Whoa. Okay...

10:43.944 --> 10:45.544
what are we talking about here?

10:45.546 --> 10:48.213
Like, "Blair" witch or
"Wizard of Oz" witch?

10:50.050 --> 10:51.383
Neither.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.426
Hey, handsome.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.462
Hey.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.436
How's your father?

11:12.939 --> 11:15.105
He's recuperating.

11:15.107 --> 11:16.741
And Jorge?

11:17.911 --> 11:20.711
He buried the sheriff's body.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.847
He took extra care, like you asked.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.651
None of this
should have happened.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.052
Karen deserved better.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.688
Jeremy, I know how you're feeling,

11:31.690 --> 11:33.890
but don't let that cloud your judgment.

11:33.892 --> 11:37.094
None of this will stop as
long as Roman's still alive.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.029
You don't have to go after him alone.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.431
Let us help you.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.200
I'm going to do what I
must, and so will you.

11:44.202 --> 11:46.470
At least wait until
we have Marsten back.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.304
There is no time, Elena.

11:48.306 --> 11:50.774
I expect you to keep the Pack together.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.679
Let's go, darlin'.

13:29.237 --> 13:30.604
Breakfast special.

14:26.529 --> 14:28.763
Tell me how it all started.

14:28.787 --> 14:31.988
The lights. They'd
flicker when he cried.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.922
- Right away?
- No.

14:33.924 --> 14:35.291
Uh, it would take a minute.

14:35.293 --> 14:37.159
If I couldn't soothe him in time,

14:37.161 --> 14:40.129
poor thing would get so worked up.

14:40.131 --> 14:41.864
Then things started to move.

14:41.866 --> 14:44.233
Little things at first.

14:44.235 --> 14:46.502
Like, a fork would fall off the table;

14:46.504 --> 14:50.939
the pictures in the room
would get knocked sideways.

14:50.941 --> 14:53.008
The toys were the first things

14:53.010 --> 14:55.110
to float towards the crib.

14:55.112 --> 14:56.778
It was Aleister at the compound.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.580
When he injected Rachel
with Savannah's blood,

14:58.582 --> 15:01.082
it must've affected the baby.

15:01.084 --> 15:03.084
I have never seen a baby

15:03.086 --> 15:05.720
showing magical abilities before.

15:05.722 --> 15:07.688
I just don't want Rocco to hurt himself.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.157
That's the weird part.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.059
A baby his age can't
see past a few feet.

15:11.061 --> 15:12.494
So how is he moving things

15:12.496 --> 15:15.096
that he can't see across a room?

15:15.098 --> 15:16.931
Is there a way to...

15:16.933 --> 15:18.400
uh... to cure him?

15:18.402 --> 15:20.902
- It isn't a sickness.
- Hey.

15:20.904 --> 15:24.038
That's not what she meant.
You know that.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.840
Of course.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.642
Let's find out what's
really going on here.

15:27.644 --> 15:30.210
I need you to write everything down.

15:30.212 --> 15:32.914
Don't leave out any details.

15:32.916 --> 15:35.182
And I need something of Rocco's.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.117
A pacifier.

15:37.119 --> 15:39.153
Uh, in my room, on the dresser.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.354
I can get it.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.588
Why do I get the feeling

15:41.590 --> 15:43.157
like I'm going to be hunting

15:43.159 --> 15:46.193
for alderwood and hemlock soon?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.863
No, but I will need
crickets and pine cones.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.465
Great.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.934
You haven't told me what you want.

16:28.936 --> 16:31.236
From you? Nothing.

16:32.272 --> 16:33.839
Which is all well and good,

16:33.841 --> 16:36.575
since I have nothing to offer you.

16:38.445 --> 16:40.779
You will bring us the ones that we want.

16:40.781 --> 16:42.380
And who might they be?

16:42.382 --> 16:44.382
Anyone on the list.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.996
I've travelled to Russia...

16:57.998 --> 17:00.464
heard tales of The Albino,

17:00.466 --> 17:03.300
the werewolf with the one red eye.

17:03.302 --> 17:05.970
Appeared and disappeared like a ghost.

17:05.972 --> 17:10.775
Even the most stout-hearted
crossed themselves and spat.

17:13.747 --> 17:17.414
I thought it was a convenient fable,

17:17.415 --> 17:19.517
a bogeyman for Roman's men.

17:26.392 --> 17:28.559
Do you believe in a bogeyman?

17:43.208 --> 17:44.607
Come. Step out.

17:45.477 --> 17:46.810
I'll show you.

18:05.529 --> 18:07.663
Yes.

18:07.665 --> 18:09.699
That's a good mouse.

18:49.539 --> 18:52.340
You've spent a lot of time here. Hmm?

18:54.110 --> 18:57.911
Well, I made a vow to
look after Logan's son.

18:57.913 --> 19:00.180
Is that all?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.515
What?

19:03.486 --> 19:04.818
Oh, come on.

19:06.088 --> 19:07.455
Logan was my best friend.

19:07.457 --> 19:10.057
Rachel was his fiancée.

19:10.059 --> 19:11.358
Who do you think I am?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.626
I'm not accusing you of anything.

19:12.628 --> 19:14.361
I'm just saying that
these things happen.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.363
- Nothing's happening.
- Okay.

19:19.101 --> 19:20.433
You know what?

19:21.837 --> 19:24.437
You're something, you're
really something.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.441
You break my heart

19:28.443 --> 19:30.910
and I don't hear from you
for almost a year...

19:30.912 --> 19:33.146
I'm sorry, okay?

19:33.148 --> 19:34.714
It's been hectic.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.182
I sold the cosmetics company.

19:36.184 --> 19:38.385
Savannah and I are packing
up and moving to Portland.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.087
There's just... too many bad memories

19:41.089 --> 19:43.222
on the East coast.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.991
Well, what's in Portland?

19:50.932 --> 19:52.932
Should I ask who is in Portland?

19:54.435 --> 19:55.768
He's a lawyer.

20:02.142 --> 20:03.776
Does this, um...

20:05.045 --> 20:06.845
lawyer have a name?

20:08.115 --> 20:10.349
You werewolves, always
looking for the hunt.

20:10.351 --> 20:12.584
Just let this one go, Nick.

20:14.855 --> 20:17.322
You're right where you belong.

20:17.324 --> 20:19.691
Right here, taking care of them.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.961
They're lucky to have you.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.800
You know, I was lucky once.

20:34.741 --> 20:37.475
I found some wild dill weed.

20:37.477 --> 20:39.143
My mother used to make okróshka with it

20:39.145 --> 20:41.479
back in Vladivostok. Russia?

20:41.481 --> 20:44.415
W... are you connected
with Roman Navikev?

20:45.885 --> 20:47.518
How do you know about him?

20:47.520 --> 20:49.519
We've had some dealings
with the Russian Alpha.

20:49.521 --> 20:50.988
Since he found out about us,

20:50.990 --> 20:52.723
- he's been hunting for Russian witches.
- What?

20:52.725 --> 20:55.392
The Coven there has scattered
and gone into hiding.

20:55.394 --> 20:56.626
One of them is missing.

20:56.628 --> 20:59.629
What could Roman want with witches?

20:59.631 --> 21:02.166
What all men want.

21:02.168 --> 21:03.500
Power.

21:11.042 --> 21:12.942
Nick? Update. How is the baby?

21:12.944 --> 21:15.144
Paige is here doing some sort of...

21:15.146 --> 21:16.713
witchy experiment thing.

21:16.715 --> 21:18.782
Paige is there?
For Rocco?

21:18.784 --> 21:20.717
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

21:20.719 --> 21:22.852
Nick, that child is very important.

21:22.854 --> 21:24.720
He's the future of our Pack.

21:24.722 --> 21:26.589
I need you to protect
him and to guide him.

21:26.591 --> 21:28.758
It's up to all of us, isn't it?

21:28.760 --> 21:31.861
My focus is the Russian Alpha.

21:31.863 --> 21:34.964
Paige mentioned that Roman
is hunting Russian witches.

21:34.966 --> 21:37.566
Then he can't find out
what's happening to Rocco.

21:37.568 --> 21:39.034
A werewolf child with those powers...

21:39.036 --> 21:41.771
I won't let Roman anywhere near Rocco.

21:46.878 --> 21:48.944
There's no black SUVs.

21:48.946 --> 21:50.913
Just this truck. I haven't
seen any movement.

21:50.915 --> 21:52.815
- They could have killed Marsten by now.
- No, he's in there.

21:52.817 --> 21:54.717
I checked the whole
perimeter of the building.

21:54.719 --> 21:58.086
- I only catch one other scent.
- The guy in the video.

21:58.088 --> 21:59.554
He's getting closer.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.440
This guy kills just to be cute.

22:20.777 --> 22:22.710
Then we stop him.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.176
What is that going to do?

22:27.178 --> 22:29.779
I'll be able to
track the energy flow.

22:29.781 --> 22:31.714
But he can't see anything from his crib.

22:31.965 --> 22:33.330
Telekinesis only works

22:33.332 --> 22:35.033
if you can see what you're moving.

22:35.035 --> 22:37.669
You said that he moved items
that he couldn't see.

22:37.671 --> 22:40.237
We have to find out how he's doing it.

22:40.239 --> 22:42.807
You mean, like he's got
more than one power?

22:42.809 --> 22:45.009
That's what I'm trying to find out.

22:45.011 --> 22:46.644
Is any of this dangerous?

22:50.383 --> 22:52.883
I've never done it before.

22:52.885 --> 22:54.585
That's not comforting.

22:54.587 --> 22:57.087
This is all new for me too, Rachel.

22:58.424 --> 22:59.956
Whatever you do,

22:59.958 --> 23:01.659
don't break the circle.

23:09.868 --> 23:11.101
This was a mistake.

23:11.103 --> 23:13.136
Just... just wait a second, okay?

23:13.138 --> 23:15.005
It only happens when he's crying.

23:15.007 --> 23:17.574
Well then, let him cry.

23:17.576 --> 23:19.642
Hey, hey, look,

23:19.644 --> 23:22.378
I promise nothing will
happen to Rocco, okay?

24:03.587 --> 24:04.986
- No, we've got to stop it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

24:04.988 --> 24:06.455
Something is wrong.

24:06.457 --> 24:08.156
The energy isn't coming
from inside the circle.

24:08.158 --> 24:09.924
- This is crazy.
- Stop!

24:11.394 --> 24:12.794
Nick, don't touch her.

24:12.796 --> 24:14.996
What's happening to me?

24:14.998 --> 24:16.330
The baby's fine. Nick,

24:16.332 --> 24:18.099
- get Rachel out of here.
- Okay.

24:18.101 --> 24:19.567
Come on, Rachel, come on.

24:19.569 --> 24:20.769
He's okay.

24:23.406 --> 24:24.705
Katia!

24:24.707 --> 24:25.940
Calm down. It's over.

24:25.942 --> 24:28.041
It's like I'm covered in ants!

24:28.043 --> 24:29.577
Help me, please!

24:30.780 --> 24:31.979
Dorme.

24:34.784 --> 24:37.752
Paige! You better get in here!

24:50.532 --> 24:52.065
Rachel...

24:53.635 --> 24:55.669
there's nothing wrong with the baby.

24:57.339 --> 25:00.373
Rocco's fine, Rachel.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.509
He doesn't have magical powers.

25:04.078 --> 25:06.179
Then what is happening?

25:08.950 --> 25:10.283
It's you.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.720
It's always been you.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.288
You just never knew it.

25:31.372 --> 25:34.005
There's more rooms up ahead.

25:34.007 --> 25:35.207
I think they're holding Marsten

25:35.209 --> 25:36.542
on the other side of the building.

25:36.544 --> 25:38.677
Let's clear the floor and find him.

26:12.078 --> 26:13.277
Clay!

26:19.118 --> 26:21.586
Clay! Can you hear me?

26:53.833 --> 26:55.732
Get away from me.

27:06.044 --> 27:08.712
It's just water.

27:09.019 --> 27:11.052
Um, what is it with you Americans?

27:11.151 --> 27:12.717
You don't trust anyone.

27:12.719 --> 27:13.918
Where is Clay?

27:13.920 --> 27:16.153
He's sleeping.

27:21.928 --> 27:26.631
Huh... a wolf with one red eye.

27:26.633 --> 27:28.465
Sasha told me about you.

27:29.969 --> 27:31.535
You killed his wife.

27:32.225 --> 27:33.691
She got in the way.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.193
I wanted the children.

27:37.363 --> 27:38.996
What's your name?

27:39.899 --> 27:41.599
My name doesn't matter.

27:41.601 --> 27:42.967
Yours does.

27:42.969 --> 27:44.401
Elena Michaels.

27:44.403 --> 27:47.371
Though you really are
Antonov, aren't you?

27:47.373 --> 27:49.306
I thought it would take time find you,

27:49.308 --> 27:52.175
but... you are first up.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.678
Roman sent you.

27:56.048 --> 27:58.048
His mistake is now yours.

27:59.218 --> 28:01.684
Navikev doesn't send me anywhere.

28:01.686 --> 28:03.253
He gives me a name.

28:04.156 --> 28:05.488
You see?

28:06.759 --> 28:09.092
This is my list.

28:12.831 --> 28:15.265
You are on it.

28:18.637 --> 28:21.070
- That is all.
- And the other names?

28:21.939 --> 28:23.439
They are dead.

28:24.643 --> 28:27.009
And so are you.

28:27.011 --> 28:28.811
You're on the list.

28:28.813 --> 28:30.179
Why me?

28:31.683 --> 28:33.616
Navikev said it's his bloodline,

28:33.618 --> 28:36.451
but I don't care about these
things, just the names.

28:37.688 --> 28:39.554
I didn't see Marsten on your list.

28:39.556 --> 28:41.423
Ah...

28:41.425 --> 28:44.794
the, uh, the what you call it? Dandy?

28:44.796 --> 28:47.163
He is a just a convenience
to get to you.

28:49.033 --> 28:51.232
You've got me now.

28:51.234 --> 28:52.967
So let him go.

28:52.969 --> 28:54.269
Maybe, maybe not.

28:54.271 --> 28:56.538
We'll see how we feel.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.540
Same goes for your big friend.

28:58.542 --> 29:01.943
I may need them to find the others.

29:01.945 --> 29:03.945
Or...

29:03.947 --> 29:05.447
you tell me.

29:06.983 --> 29:08.983
They're gone.

29:08.985 --> 29:10.185
You're not going to find them.

29:10.187 --> 29:11.585
Yes, I will.

29:11.587 --> 29:13.621
One at a time.

29:13.623 --> 29:16.891
You chase two rabbits, you catch none.

29:16.893 --> 29:18.226
Let's see...

29:20.096 --> 29:21.696
Tell me...

29:24.300 --> 29:26.066
where Katia Antonov is.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.803
She will be easy... human girl.

29:28.805 --> 29:30.371
Go to hell.

29:32.908 --> 29:34.241
Tsk.

29:36.011 --> 29:37.545
This is too bad.

29:42.151 --> 29:44.952
I'm curious about many topics.

29:44.954 --> 29:47.520
I like to see how things work,

29:47.522 --> 29:49.890
how they are put together...

29:49.892 --> 29:51.758
from the inside, out.

29:52.928 --> 29:55.295
You are a woman werewolf.

29:55.297 --> 29:58.097
This is curious to me.

29:58.099 --> 30:01.267
Huh? It is a very special thing.

30:11.079 --> 30:12.412
Only one.

30:13.314 --> 30:14.813
Never before.

30:17.385 --> 30:20.186
I am sure never after.

30:20.188 --> 30:23.856
See, I would like to see
how this came about.

30:23.858 --> 30:26.092
Why is this so, after all this time?

30:26.094 --> 30:28.560
It is... very big question.

30:30.598 --> 30:32.498
But you're on the list.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.900
It's too bad. Huh?

30:37.204 --> 30:39.738
Here, this is it.

30:47.447 --> 30:48.646
Would you like to see

30:48.648 --> 30:50.949
where my curiosity has taken me?

30:50.951 --> 30:53.684
Let Clay and Marsten go...

30:53.686 --> 30:55.887
then we can talk. You know, in Chile,

30:55.889 --> 30:57.488
the death squads would interrogate

30:57.490 --> 31:00.558
by hammering nails into the skull.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.993
They did this for fun.

31:01.995 --> 31:04.629
Ah, but it was sloppy.

31:04.631 --> 31:08.232
They didn't know you only need one nail.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.701
There is one part of the brain

31:10.703 --> 31:12.570
that controls lying.

31:12.572 --> 31:15.873
In here, prefrontal cortex.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.608
All I have to do

31:17.610 --> 31:19.509
is tap-tap-tap just deep enough

31:19.511 --> 31:22.813
and boom, no more lies.

31:22.815 --> 31:25.282
You will tell me
everything I want to know,

31:25.284 --> 31:27.251
no choice.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.586
It won't do you any good.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.355
I don't know where she is.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.657
We'll see.

31:35.994 --> 31:38.127
No moving.

31:40.165 --> 31:41.898
I don't want to miss.

31:53.111 --> 31:55.445
Mmm...

31:55.447 --> 31:57.380
We have a visitor.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.581
What do you think?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.483
Kids? More friends?

32:00.485 --> 32:02.418
Let's find out.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.923
You can scream if you
want, it won't help.

32:17.802 --> 32:20.235
I have never been happier to see you.

32:22.039 --> 32:23.506
Yeah, well...

32:23.508 --> 32:25.273
hold your weed, bro.

32:28.445 --> 32:30.445
We've got to do this quietly.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.586
I don't imagine anybody heard that.

32:42.859 --> 32:44.692
Don't tell me I'm going
to have to carry you.

32:44.694 --> 32:46.861
As if my pride weren't wounded enough.
Just...

33:11.954 --> 33:13.287
Ugh!

33:47.789 --> 33:51.156
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

33:51.158 --> 33:52.491
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:54.662 --> 33:56.062
You're first.

33:56.064 --> 33:57.897
Oh, really?

33:57.899 --> 34:00.399
Well, I'm flattered, ugly.

34:00.401 --> 34:02.201
But I've got to be honest with you.

34:02.203 --> 34:04.236
You're not my first.

34:04.238 --> 34:05.937
Oof! Ohhh...

34:46.545 --> 34:47.978
Get Marsten out of here.

34:47.980 --> 34:49.780
- Clay...
- Go!

36:07.024 --> 36:08.724
Magnificent.

36:30.279 --> 36:31.478
Ah...

36:31.480 --> 36:33.146
Here is the weakness.

36:58.139 --> 37:00.239
- Hit it!
- Ugh!

37:06.247 --> 37:07.780
Who is this guy?

37:13.372 --> 37:14.571
Did anything ever happen

37:14.573 --> 37:16.306
when you weren't in the room?

37:18.143 --> 37:19.476
No.

37:22.447 --> 37:24.014
Are you saying that...

37:24.016 --> 37:27.283
I've been controlling these
things with my mind?

37:27.285 --> 37:29.852
The toys, the lights... Everything.

37:30.955 --> 37:32.822
It's incredible. A natural born witch

37:32.824 --> 37:35.958
comes to her power at puberty.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.994
You have it now.

37:37.996 --> 37:39.495
But you need to learn to control it,

37:39.497 --> 37:41.531
or it can be very dangerous.

37:52.510 --> 37:54.510
In the past year,

37:54.512 --> 37:59.081
I have been attacked in my own home,

37:59.083 --> 38:00.315
chased,

38:00.317 --> 38:02.851
kidnapped twice;

38:02.853 --> 38:06.555
I've been injected and tortured

38:06.557 --> 38:09.925
by some weird cult.

38:09.927 --> 38:14.696
I found out my fiancé and
son were werewolves.

38:14.698 --> 38:17.398
I've been shoved around, hidden away,

38:17.400 --> 38:20.669
everyone making decisions for me.

38:24.574 --> 38:27.108
And worst of all, I lost Logan

38:27.110 --> 38:28.642
to this crazy world.

38:28.644 --> 38:31.079
I have had enough of it!

38:31.081 --> 38:33.081
Hey...

38:33.083 --> 38:34.882
Rachel, it's okay.

38:34.884 --> 38:36.784
We can find a way to reverse this.

38:36.786 --> 38:38.052
Why, Nick?

38:45.728 --> 38:49.029
So... so I could just
go back to wondering

38:49.031 --> 38:51.865
when Jeremy will decide
to take my son away?

38:51.867 --> 38:53.701
What he'll do with me?

38:53.703 --> 38:56.169
Like he has a right to choose.

38:56.171 --> 38:57.471
It doesn't have to be that way.

38:57.473 --> 38:59.906
You're right! It doesn't!

39:02.511 --> 39:04.544
If you're telling me

39:04.546 --> 39:06.113
that I can learn to do what you do

39:06.115 --> 39:10.183
and take my life back,
and protect my son,

39:10.185 --> 39:13.686
then you're damned right, I want it.

39:48.756 --> 39:50.856
Why haven't you answered your phone?

39:50.858 --> 39:52.190
Are you okay?

39:52.192 --> 39:54.126
You're not going to
believe what I just saw.

39:54.128 --> 39:55.593
It doesn't matter.

39:55.595 --> 39:57.562
Elena just told us...

39:57.564 --> 39:58.764
He's here.

39:58.766 --> 40:00.398
What? Who's here?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.967
The one who killed Mom.

40:02.969 --> 40:05.336
The red-eyed wolf.

40:05.338 --> 40:07.104
You saw him?

40:07.106 --> 40:09.307
He attacked Elena. She got away, but...

40:09.309 --> 40:11.276
but he's here, he's after us.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.843
We're doomed, Katia!

40:12.845 --> 40:13.978
Okay, calm down.

40:16.183 --> 40:19.249
What if he makes us watch
while he kills Dad?

40:19.251 --> 40:20.785
I can't take this.

40:20.787 --> 40:22.219
We'll figure something out, okay?

40:22.221 --> 40:24.055
There's no way to stop him!
You know that!

40:24.057 --> 40:26.090
Alexei, stop it.

40:26.092 --> 40:27.925
How's Dad?

40:27.927 --> 40:29.493
He's, um...

40:30.629 --> 40:32.529
He's still out of it.

40:39.238 --> 40:40.437
Katia...

40:40.439 --> 40:41.771
Yeah?

40:45.544 --> 40:48.278
I changed yesterday.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.680
I was a wolf.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.416
That's good. That's good, right?

40:53.418 --> 40:54.718
You're getting stronger.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.720
You'll get through this.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.191
I killed a guy.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.197
Oh, Alexei...

41:07.199 --> 41:09.298
Look, I'm really scared.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.209
Dad was right.

41:20.211 --> 41:23.479
All this goes away if we stop Roman.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.514
I can do it if I get close to him.

41:26.516 --> 41:28.516
How are you going to do that?

41:30.888 --> 41:33.088
I can bring him something that he wants.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.491
And once I'm close,

41:36.493 --> 41:39.194
I'll kill him.

41:39.196 --> 41:40.528
Katia...

41:41.598 --> 41:42.930
Katia.

41:55.912 --> 41:59.147
- You have my undying gratitude.
- How you feeling?

41:59.149 --> 42:00.848
Every muscle is screaming bloody murder

42:00.850 --> 42:02.616
and I believe I lost a tooth.

42:02.618 --> 42:05.253
Other than that, it's good to be alive.

42:07.023 --> 42:08.622
No sign of him.

42:08.624 --> 42:10.457
We need to get rid of the body.

42:10.459 --> 42:11.659
Take Marsten with you,

42:11.661 --> 42:13.094
- find a place you can recuperate.
- No,

42:13.096 --> 42:14.828
let's find this red-eyed dipshit

42:14.830 --> 42:17.731
- and tear him apart.
- It's not going to be that easy.

42:17.733 --> 42:20.434
We have to regroup,
get everyone healthy,

42:20.436 --> 42:21.902
and then we can find him.

42:21.904 --> 42:24.037
Good thing is, it's just one guy, right?

42:24.039 --> 42:25.839
The bad thing is...

42:25.841 --> 42:28.074
seems like he doesn't need anyone else.

42:50.198 --> 42:51.531
Nick!

42:52.600 --> 42:55.535
Oh, my God. Nick!

42:55.537 --> 42:56.736
What is it? What's wrong?

42:56.738 --> 42:59.472
Where is she? Where is the girl?

42:59.474 --> 43:01.307
I put her in your room.
