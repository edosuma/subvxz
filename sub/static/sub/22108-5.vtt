Okay, I think I have it
all nailed down now.

00:38.857 --> 00:40.983
If I start the carrots
at 11:30 tomorrow,

00:41.060 --> 00:42.381
they should be done
right when the turkey

00:42.438 --> 00:43.781
needs its last basting,

00:43.839 --> 00:45.828
and everything will be ready
for our noon meal.

00:45.907 --> 00:48.023
Did I tell you guys
I'm using a new brine?

00:48.100 --> 00:49.334
You may have mentioned it.

00:49.411 --> 00:51.036
The brine blogs are going nuts.

00:51.113 --> 00:52.194
I wasn't listening.

00:52.271 --> 00:53.705
- Tell me again.
- Gene, no.

00:53.782 --> 00:55.697
Well, you can add orange peel...

00:55.774 --> 00:56.931
Orange peel for flavor.

00:57.008 --> 00:58.377
- You told us, Bob.
- We know.

00:58.454 --> 00:59.767
Don't overthink it.

00:59.844 --> 01:01.732
You get yourself all wound up,
and it's a real turnoff.

01:01.789 --> 01:03.768
Well, it helps to say it
out loud so I get it right.

01:03.825 --> 01:04.938
And, you know, most people

01:05.016 --> 01:06.485
would be turned on
by a new brine.

01:06.562 --> 01:08.343
Bob! Bob. Bob.

01:08.420 --> 01:10.045
- Uh, what?
- I need your help.

01:10.122 --> 01:12.043
I was supposed to go
to my sister's for Thanksgiving,

01:12.100 --> 01:14.726
like I do every year,
but now my mom's flying in,

01:14.803 --> 01:17.019
so it's easier for my sister
to pick her up

01:17.096 --> 01:18.930
and then come to my place
to have dinner!

01:19.007 --> 01:20.022
Oh, how fun.

01:20.099 --> 01:21.566
How many people are you having?

01:21.643 --> 01:24.692
I don't know. My sister,
her husband, my mom,

01:24.769 --> 01:27.962
my mom's new, slightly
age-inappropriate boyfriend.

01:28.039 --> 01:31.036
It's not fun, Linda.
I got to cook and what, uh,

01:31.094 --> 01:33.157
set out plates?
Right? Is that what you do?

01:33.215 --> 01:34.748
I don't know how to do
any of that stuff!

01:34.805 --> 01:36.244
- You got to come over to help me!
- Okay.

01:36.301 --> 01:38.021
Teddy, I don't know.
We closed early,

01:38.079 --> 01:39.739
and I still
barely have enough time

01:39.797 --> 01:41.886
to do everything I have to do
for our Thanksgiving.

01:41.963 --> 01:43.288
I have a new brine I'm trying,

01:43.365 --> 01:45.713
and I-I was thinking
about spatchcocking.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.150
Spatchcocking?
With those hips? Honey, no.

01:48.227 --> 01:50.729
Gene. It's when you take
the backbone out of the turkey

01:50.806 --> 01:53.088
and you press it flat.
It cooks more evenly.

01:53.165 --> 01:55.757
I thought women had to deal
with unfair body expectations.

01:55.834 --> 01:56.955
Bob, come on,
I'm desperate here.

01:57.012 --> 01:58.270
I'm asking you, help me out.

01:58.347 --> 02:00.262
All right, well,
I-I guess I could write out

02:00.339 --> 02:01.616
some basic instructions for you.

02:01.673 --> 02:03.113
- Write-write-write it up.
- Bob, no.

02:03.185 --> 02:05.076
Come on,
where's your Turkey Day spirit?

02:05.153 --> 02:06.768
It won't take much time.

02:06.845 --> 02:08.780
We'll come over and help you,

02:21.403 --> 02:23.618
Well, we got you
a good bird, Teddy.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.853
Almost as good
as the one I left at home

02:25.930 --> 02:28.107
that I wish
I was with right now.

02:28.165 --> 02:30.125
I miss him. But that's okay.

02:30.202 --> 02:32.171
So, first I'll show you
how to do the rub.

02:32.248 --> 02:33.363
I could use a rub.

02:33.421 --> 02:36.298
I'm holding a little spelling
test tension right back here.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.641
We're talking about the bird,
Gene. We're gonna rub it.

02:38.699 --> 02:40.457
- Fine, I'll go second.
- Okay.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.966
So, where are you gonna set up
your table?

02:42.023 --> 02:43.438
Here in the middle of the room?

02:43.515 --> 02:45.350
Show us exactly
where you want your guests

02:45.427 --> 02:47.242
- to be underwhelmed.
- Louise.

02:47.319 --> 02:49.040
Oh, I was just thinking
that we'd put everything

02:49.097 --> 02:50.375
- on the coffee table.
- Perfect.

02:50.432 --> 02:52.614
Then we sit on the couch,
right? -Very sad.

02:52.691 --> 02:54.593
Okay. And then
we pull the chairs over.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.917
- Yeah. -No.
- Right?

02:55.994 --> 02:57.596
- Nice and cozy, though, right?
- Eh.

02:57.673 --> 02:59.631
Tell you what,
you and Bob start on the food,

02:59.708 --> 03:01.866
and the kids and I
will set up out here, okay?

03:01.943 --> 03:03.158
All right, sounds great.

03:03.235 --> 03:04.769
Okay.
I think there are some candles

03:04.846 --> 03:06.994
in the closet here,
but stay out of that room.

03:07.071 --> 03:09.508
Nothing much in there... just
a couple of personal things.

03:09.585 --> 03:11.065
All right, we'll figure it out.

03:11.142 --> 03:13.067
- Go, go learn how to cook.
- "Bam." Right?

03:13.144 --> 03:14.546
That's what Emeril does. "Bam"?

03:14.623 --> 03:15.903
- Teddy, go!
- Right?

03:15.980 --> 03:17.549
- Go.
- Okay, right. Yes, going.

03:19.278 --> 03:20.842
Huh. Lot of stuff.

03:20.919 --> 03:23.077
Like unopened, blank VHS tapes.

03:23.154 --> 03:24.356
And old thermometers.

03:24.433 --> 03:25.780
If those tips could talk.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.815
Kids, don't touch those.
Put that stuff back.

03:27.892 --> 03:29.180
Let's keep looking
for the candles.

03:29.237 --> 03:30.652
Don't touch anything gross.

03:30.729 --> 03:32.512
Okay, Teddy, Thanksgiving is

03:32.574 --> 03:34.063
the most important meal
of the year,

03:34.121 --> 03:37.035
which makes the turkey,
like, the king of foods.

03:37.112 --> 03:39.215
Here he comes, right?

03:39.273 --> 03:40.348
- Yep, the king.
- Okay.

03:40.406 --> 03:41.082
- All right.
- Got it.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.457
And the trick is,
with the rubs,

03:42.515 --> 03:44.278
is to go under the skin. All right?
Yep.

03:44.336 --> 03:45.807
- So you start at the bottom,
- Yeah.

03:45.887 --> 03:47.312
And then you massage in the rub

03:47.389 --> 03:49.748
and gently make your way
to the neck. -Wow.

03:49.825 --> 03:52.183
Yeah. Think of the meat
as the canvas -Oh.

03:52.267 --> 03:54.192
And the rub as the paint.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.509
Lot of metaphors, Bobby.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.001
You know what?
I'm already doing it,

03:57.059 --> 03:59.043
- so I'll-I'll just finish.
- Right. You finish.

03:59.121 --> 04:00.448
- Yeah.
- Because I'm...

04:00.525 --> 04:02.731
It's actually making me sick.
Is that normal?

04:02.801 --> 04:04.728
I'll tell you what, you can
start peeling the carrots

04:04.785 --> 04:06.718
if you want. One less thing
to do tomorrow. -Right, right.

04:06.775 --> 04:08.553
- On it. Give me space.
- All right. Good. Yep.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.088
Okay, just grab the peeler
right there

04:10.145 --> 04:11.503
- and peel the carrots.
- This?

04:11.580 --> 04:12.704
That's the spatula.

04:12.781 --> 04:13.895
I knew that. This?

04:13.953 --> 04:15.684
Th-That's a ladle.

04:15.799 --> 04:17.991
The... I-It's that thing
right next to the carrots.

04:18.076 --> 04:19.430
- This?
- That's the spatula again.

04:19.488 --> 04:20.902
- It's...
- No, right. Yes. Right.

04:20.978 --> 04:22.501
It's right there.
It's the only thing

04:22.559 --> 04:23.706
that looks like
it could peel a carrot.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.324
Right.
Why didn't you just say that?

04:25.387 --> 04:26.325
Oh, my God.

04:26.383 --> 04:27.529
- I'm not an idiot.
- You're holding the blade.

04:27.586 --> 04:28.740
- No, I got it. Right.
- You're holding the blade.

04:28.797 --> 04:29.908
- Hold the handle. Teddy.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

04:29.965 --> 04:31.366
- Easy. Easy. Easy.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

04:31.423 --> 04:32.977
- Uh-oh. Uh, you know what?
- Ow. How do you... Ow. Ow.

04:33.034 --> 04:35.270
Once I'm done with the rub,
we'll put this in the fridge,

04:35.327 --> 04:37.215
- and I'll help you with that.
- Is this peeled enough?

04:37.272 --> 04:39.053
It's not peeled at all.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.422
Still no candles.

04:40.499 --> 04:41.856
But lots of chopsticks.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.635
Maybe we can arrange them
like candles?

04:43.712 --> 04:46.037
If we soak 'em in gas,
they'll burn real pretty.

04:46.114 --> 04:48.496
Never mind,
it's filled with pennies.

04:48.573 --> 04:50.798
So am I. You don't hear me
bragging about it.

04:50.856 --> 04:51.928
Let's check in here.

04:51.986 --> 04:53.601
But Teddy said
not to go in there.

04:53.678 --> 04:55.246
He's probably hiding
something creepy,

04:55.323 --> 04:57.572
like a dead body
or an indoor hot tub.

04:57.649 --> 04:59.250
Ah, let's just take
a little peek.

05:00.919 --> 05:02.544
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God!

05:02.621 --> 05:03.878
Teddy's a hoarder.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.913
Oh, so, just snap off
the tops, huh?

05:05.990 --> 05:07.392
Th-That's it. Nice and easy.

05:07.469 --> 05:10.340
Off with their heads.

05:10.419 --> 05:11.786
Eh. Bob, open up.

05:11.863 --> 05:14.232
Ugh. That's the...
that's the part you don't eat.

05:14.309 --> 05:16.023
- You do it.
- Ah...

05:16.115 --> 05:19.098
Mmm, those are good.
Give me the other one.

05:20.271 --> 05:21.660
So, tomorrow,
you just take this guy out

05:21.717 --> 05:23.751
- and put him in the oven for...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:23.808 --> 05:25.630
Don't say another word.
I'm gonna write it all down.

05:25.687 --> 05:26.978
Let me get some paper.

05:27.942 --> 05:28.903
Teddy?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.044
- Aah.
- What the...?

05:30.102 --> 05:31.696
- Uh, surprise.
- Oh. Oh.

05:31.754 --> 05:32.817
We found your dining room.

05:32.894 --> 05:34.242
- Aah.
- We're cleaning it out

05:34.319 --> 05:36.236
so you can have
Thanksgiving dinner in there.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.423
What? No,
that's a storage room.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.947
Oh, whoa.

05:40.024 --> 05:42.111
But we found a dining table
under all of the stuff.

05:42.169 --> 05:43.689
Oh, and it's a beaut.

05:43.747 --> 05:45.157
Look at those legs.

05:45.215 --> 05:47.153
- I'd let that hold my turkey.
- Right?

05:47.223 --> 05:48.501
Yep. And Gene, Louise and I

05:48.559 --> 05:49.977
are trying to see
who can find the best thing.

05:50.034 --> 05:51.623
How do you decide
what the best thing is?

05:51.680 --> 05:52.927
You know it when you see it.

05:53.011 --> 05:55.696
I'm the front-runner
with that Gerald Ford bobblehead

05:55.754 --> 05:56.767
that doesn't bobble.

05:56.825 --> 05:57.999
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

05:58.057 --> 06:00.040
- A box of doorknobs.
- A box of doorknobs who?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.944
Teddy has a box of doorknobs
for some reason.

06:02.002 --> 06:03.174
New front-runner.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.191
Oh, good knock-knock.

06:05.249 --> 06:07.323
Okay, now let's-let's
get all that stuff back.

06:07.385 --> 06:08.640
Come on, guys.
That'll be fun, right?

06:08.697 --> 06:10.522
Put all the... Put the...
put that stuff back

06:10.599 --> 06:12.347
and just close the doors! Ow!

06:12.424 --> 06:14.493
Oh, I think
that ship has sailed, Teddy.

06:14.570 --> 06:15.750
Yeah, it would take us

06:15.827 --> 06:17.181
just as long
to put everything back

06:17.238 --> 06:18.997
as it would
to fix up the dining room.

06:19.074 --> 06:22.549

06:22.619 --> 06:23.672

all of this was in one room.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.187
You guys weren't supposed
to see it.

06:33.244 --> 06:35.136
I can't wait to grow up

what is this,
some sort of hookah?

06:39.341 --> 06:41.405
- It's an aquarium pump.
- Do you have an aquarium?

06:41.463 --> 06:43.505
No. I was gonna
get the pump working

06:43.563 --> 06:44.689
and then... go from there.

06:44.747 --> 06:46.825

can I have a word with you

06:50.750 --> 06:52.351
Are we sure
we want to get into this?

06:52.426 --> 06:53.454
Teddy is a hoarder.

06:53.512 --> 06:54.763
I-I mean,
I thought he had so little,

06:54.820 --> 06:56.683
but... he has too much.

06:56.741 --> 06:57.825
Exactly, Bob.

06:57.902 --> 06:59.438
And that hoarder needs
our help.

06:59.515 --> 07:02.491
Shouldn't we call a doctor
or a TV show?

07:02.570 --> 07:03.835
Bob, he's our friend.

07:03.898 --> 07:05.558
We need to be here
for him, okay?

07:05.616 --> 07:06.845
Lin, we came here to help him

07:06.922 --> 07:09.180
cook his Thanksgiving dinner,
and we did that.

07:09.257 --> 07:11.806
We don't have time
to de-hoard his dining room.

07:11.991 --> 07:14.074
But the dining room
is part of Thanksgiving.

07:14.132 --> 07:15.366
And when he sits at that table

07:15.437 --> 07:16.708
and he says
what he's thankful for,

07:16.765 --> 07:17.952
he'll say, "Linda.

07:18.023 --> 07:19.624
And the rest
of those darn Belchers."

07:19.701 --> 07:21.070
Uh, fine.

07:21.257 --> 07:22.350
Oh, your breath.

07:22.427 --> 07:25.030
Okay, Teddy, all we have to do

07:25.109 --> 07:27.198
is get rid of some of
this stuff, right? -What?!

07:27.275 --> 07:30.445
I-I mean, we're gonna change
the location of some of it

07:30.546 --> 07:34.257
from inside your house
to not inside your house.

07:34.398 --> 07:35.730
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

07:35.796 --> 07:36.891
And you can have
a nice Thanksgiving

07:36.948 --> 07:38.680
with your family
at the dining room table.

07:38.765 --> 07:40.199
The living room is nice enough.

07:40.257 --> 07:41.824
Plus, there's a big stain
on the table.

07:41.882 --> 07:43.237
Yeah, how'd that get there?

07:43.314 --> 07:46.077
I sanded it down to refinish it,
but then I started working

07:46.155 --> 07:47.465
on this cuckoo clock
to fix that.

07:47.523 --> 07:48.793
And then the cuckoo scared me,

07:48.851 --> 07:50.177
and I spat grape juice
everywhere.

07:50.254 --> 07:51.510
If we find
that son of a bitch cuckoo,

07:51.567 --> 07:52.718
I call it for best thing.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.801
Ah, well, that's what
tablecloths are for.

07:54.859 --> 07:56.951
Tablecloth?
What's a tablecloth?

07:57.028 --> 07:58.119
How about a sheet?

07:58.234 --> 08:00.131
I can't do that.
I just have the one on my bed.

08:00.208 --> 08:02.598
And that one's probably
got enough food stains on it.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.512
Well, kids, call time-out
on your little game.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.059
Find something
we can use as a runner

08:07.117 --> 08:09.015
to cover up the stain
on the table, okay?

08:09.125 --> 08:10.976
Teddy, I might regret
asking this,

08:11.052 --> 08:12.963
but why do you have
all this stuff?

08:13.021 --> 08:14.702
It's not "stuff," Bob.
It's things.

08:14.779 --> 08:17.348
Mm-hmm. -Things I'm fixing up.
I'm a handyman, you know.

08:17.425 --> 08:19.461
Right. And I'm a cook,

08:19.539 --> 08:22.209
but I don't keep 600 pounds
of food in my dining room.

08:22.286 --> 08:23.978
N-Never mind. You're...
You'll be fine.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.183
I-I'm gonna write down
instructions for your dinner.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.226
Okay, Teddy,
I heard of a technique

08:28.284 --> 08:30.881
for de-cluttering
where you hold something up

08:30.939 --> 08:33.297
and you ask,
"Does this love me?"

08:33.374 --> 08:34.407
Go on.

08:34.571 --> 08:36.222
Does this stool love me? Yes.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.001
But is it in love with you?

08:38.078 --> 08:40.500
Teddy and a stool,
sitting in a tree...

08:40.633 --> 08:43.465
T-R-E-E-E-E-E.

08:43.542 --> 08:44.843
Kids, shh-shh.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.400
What about this?

08:46.477 --> 08:48.736
An old telephone
without a receiver.

08:48.813 --> 08:50.572
That loves me. It really does.

08:50.649 --> 08:52.383
Like, almost too much.
It's embarrassing.

08:52.460 --> 08:53.731
Okay, I'll tell you what.

08:53.789 --> 08:54.881
I'm gonna put these into piles

08:54.938 --> 08:56.419
that I think
will help you decide

08:56.477 --> 08:58.145
whether or not
they love you, okay?

08:58.222 --> 09:00.825
What are we gonna do with all
the stuff that doesn't love him?

09:00.902 --> 09:02.226
Burn it? In the alley?

09:02.303 --> 09:03.888
Maybe. No.

09:03.946 --> 09:05.860
Teddy, can you get a Dumpster
over here?

09:05.954 --> 09:07.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A Dumpster?

09:08.014 --> 09:10.550
I was thinking, like, maybe just
a couple of armloads of stuff.

09:10.612 --> 09:12.321
Maybe a small shopping bag.

09:12.383 --> 09:13.625
See if we get that filled up.

09:13.704 --> 09:16.508
Teddy, look at all this.
It's a lot.

09:16.649 --> 09:19.505
I know, but getting a Dumpster
on such short notice?

09:19.563 --> 09:21.813
The permits, the red tape...
What am I supposed to do,

09:21.899 --> 09:23.200
just call the Dumpster Fairy?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.016
You know construction people,
right?

09:25.093 --> 09:26.541
I guess I could call Dennis.

09:26.618 --> 09:28.243
Is Dennis the Dumpster Fairy?

09:28.324 --> 09:29.796
Or our fairy god-Dumpster?

09:29.854 --> 09:31.610
All right, I'm gonna go call him
from the bedroom

09:31.667 --> 09:33.411
so you can't hear me swearing
about all this.

09:33.468 --> 09:35.426
Could we use this
as the runner? -Eh.

09:35.503 --> 09:37.095
It's not very Thanksgivingy.

09:37.172 --> 09:38.820
The back is a festive beige.

09:38.897 --> 09:40.655
Yeah, I guess that could work.

09:40.732 --> 09:42.266
All right, go get plates
and silverware

09:42.343 --> 09:43.868
from the kitchen
and set up the table.

09:43.945 --> 09:46.571
Okay, Dennis is bringing
a Dumpster by in a little while.

09:46.648 --> 09:49.727
Oh, good! -He says he's gonna
borrow it from a job site,

09:49.813 --> 09:51.213
but it already
has some stuff in it.

09:51.297 --> 09:53.454
And if anyone comes
and asks anything about it,

09:53.586 --> 09:55.735
we're supposed to say,
"Vinny said it was okay."

09:55.797 --> 09:58.130
Great. -And if they say,
"Vinny's out of the joint?"

09:58.188 --> 10:00.451
we say, "Yeah, Vinny's out,
and he's got big plans."

10:00.528 --> 10:02.721
- Okay.
- Not a whole lot of plates

10:02.798 --> 10:04.679
- and only one fork.
- Hmm.

10:04.756 --> 10:06.969
There's plastic utensils
and paper plates

10:07.039 --> 10:08.829
from takeout in the drawer
next to the sink.

10:08.954 --> 10:10.481
I knew I was saving those
for something.

10:10.538 --> 10:12.563
You kids do that,
and I'll keep going with Teddy.

10:12.657 --> 10:14.680
Okay, Teddy. Does this love you?

10:14.774 --> 10:16.130
- Yes.
- Wrong.

10:16.188 --> 10:18.532
You're mistaking lust for love.

10:19.079 --> 10:20.974
Oh, the Dumpster's here.
It's here.

10:21.032 --> 10:23.164
I can't look. I mean,
I'm gonna go back in the kitchen

10:23.241 --> 10:25.391
- and see what Bob's doing.
- Okay, I'll handle it.

10:25.461 --> 10:27.610
- Do I tip or...? What, what...
- Tip your fake hat

10:27.696 --> 10:29.438
and say, "Thank you, milady."

10:29.555 --> 10:31.774
Okay, Teddy.
I-I did all the work...

10:31.899 --> 10:33.391
All of it... and wrote down

10:33.485 --> 10:35.649
exactly when you're supposed
to put these in the oven.

10:35.805 --> 10:36.977
It's foolproof.

10:37.035 --> 10:40.579
"Put in oven at 2:00
for 45 minutes at 350 degrees."

10:40.750 --> 10:42.208
Right? Is that a five or an "S"?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.561
It's a five. You just said it.

10:43.638 --> 10:46.253
350 degrees.
Why-why would it be an "S"?

10:46.330 --> 10:48.499
I don't know. I'm nervous, Bob!
I'm freaking out here!

10:48.576 --> 10:50.902
Why are you so nervous?
It's just your family.

10:50.979 --> 10:53.094
I know,
but I've never hosted before.

10:53.171 --> 10:55.193
And everything was all put away
and now it's everywhere.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.141
And it's different.
I'm just nervous.

10:57.218 --> 10:59.967
- I'm gonna go get my camera.
- Your camera? Why?

11:00.044 --> 11:01.869
Okay, I'm back, ha-ha.
Uh, pick up a dish

11:01.946 --> 11:03.771
and act like you're
putting it in the oven.

11:03.848 --> 11:05.660
- Teddy, this is crazy.
- I'm a visual learner.

11:05.717 --> 11:07.461
- It doesn't make any sense!
- Come on, Bobby, help me out!

11:07.518 --> 11:09.273
Just pretend like you're putting
those carrots in the oven.

11:09.330 --> 11:12.237
- Fine! How does my hair look?
- It-it's a little messy.

11:12.316 --> 11:13.469
Can you push it over to the...?

11:13.526 --> 11:14.898
- Push it the other way.
- Just take the picture!

11:14.955 --> 11:16.493
- Come on, just push it the other way.
- No.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.465
That's how you want to represent
yourself cooking?

11:18.522 --> 11:19.817
You're right, let me fix it.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.948
Bob, Teddy,
come out here please!

11:22.261 --> 11:24.566
Okay, this is the pile
that loves Teddy.

11:24.627 --> 11:28.047
This is the pile that likes him,
but is ready to move on.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.496
And this pile hates him.

11:29.573 --> 11:31.252
- Hates him.
- Okay, what's the fourth pile?

11:31.309 --> 11:33.133
- Oh, that stuff loves me.
- Loves her.

11:33.191 --> 11:34.401
- I'm keeping that.
- Huh.

11:34.478 --> 11:36.808
So everyone grab as much as
you can from these two piles,

11:36.870 --> 11:38.271
and let's take 'em
to the Dumpster!

11:38.329 --> 11:40.127
I call the lightbulbs.
I promise I'll be super,

11:40.184 --> 11:42.451
super gentle when I throw them
in the Dumpster

11:42.509 --> 11:43.868
as hard as I can.

11:44.157 --> 11:46.853
And I call this Magic 8-Ball
with all the water drained out.

11:46.954 --> 11:49.516
- New best thing! Beat that!
- Impossible.

11:49.593 --> 11:52.267
Hmm. My outlook for beating that
is not so good.

11:52.665 --> 11:54.560
Isn't this great?

11:54.618 --> 11:56.068
So nice and clean?

11:56.126 --> 11:58.369
And your dining room
looks so beautiful.

11:58.446 --> 12:00.415
Yeah. It is...

12:00.485 --> 12:01.892
I sure don't need
all those things

12:01.950 --> 12:02.991
that we put in the Dumpster.

12:03.048 --> 12:04.118
- This is better.
- That's right.

12:04.175 --> 12:05.588
- This is so much better.
- There he is.

12:05.645 --> 12:07.943
This is a very, very great...
Nice job, everybody.

12:08.001 --> 12:10.170
- Attaboy, attaboy.
- Right. Yup. -Nice job.

12:10.228 --> 12:11.803
Well, glad we could help,
so we should probably go, right?

12:11.860 --> 12:13.233
- Okay.
- Good luck tomorrow, Teddy.

12:13.290 --> 12:16.220
Who needs luck when I got
these Polaroids? Ah.

12:16.681 --> 12:18.407
That was a good 'un, Pa.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.978
I'm a tryp-to-fan of
what you did with this turkey.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.261
- Get it?
- It was so good and I ate so much,

12:23.338 --> 12:25.319
- I can't even finish this...
- Pie?

12:25.396 --> 12:27.231
Well, I was going to say
"sentence."

12:27.308 --> 12:29.323
- Eh, it was fine, I guess.
- What?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.250
The-the turkey was a little dry.

12:31.390 --> 12:32.843
That's why God invented gravy.

12:32.929 --> 12:34.739
Or as I call it, turkey lube.

12:34.816 --> 12:37.148
You're crazy, Bob. It was good.

12:37.304 --> 12:39.020
And the timing of the yams
was off.

12:39.078 --> 12:41.500
They were a little cold by the
time everything else was done.

12:41.656 --> 12:44.415
Who cares? It's all the same
temperature in here:

12:44.492 --> 12:46.240
98 degrees "Fartenheit."

12:46.421 --> 12:48.976
I really wish I had
spatchcocked the turkey.

12:49.053 --> 12:50.521
We-we spent so much time
at Teddy's,

12:50.598 --> 12:52.313
I-I didn't have time
to get into it.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.192
Teddy's so lucky to have
friends like us.

12:54.269 --> 12:55.817
I wonder how he's doing
over there.

12:55.894 --> 12:57.761
If he's following
my very clear instructions,

12:57.819 --> 12:59.173
then he should be doing
just fine. -

12:59.230 --> 13:00.531
Probably better than I did.

13:00.732 --> 13:01.847
Hello.

13:01.905 --> 13:03.590
Bob! I'm looking at your notes,

13:03.667 --> 13:06.270
but the pictures don't match
and the green beans are burning,

13:06.347 --> 13:08.495
or they're already burnt,
and I didn't know

13:08.572 --> 13:10.543
if I was supposed to start
the turkey yet.

13:10.660 --> 13:12.599
It's Teddy. He's not
doing well.

13:12.746 --> 13:14.715
Wait a minute,
I messed up our Thanksgiving.

13:14.863 --> 13:16.676
Teddy's sounds like a disaster.

13:16.769 --> 13:18.376
- You know what this means?
- Please don't say...

13:18.433 --> 13:19.594
We have to go to Teddy's

13:19.652 --> 13:20.923
to help him with
his Thanksgiving,

13:20.980 --> 13:22.287
- so I can redeem myself.
- So you can redeem yourself.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.707
- Oh, God.
- Aah! Too hot, too hot!

13:28.488 --> 13:29.583
Thanks for coming!

13:29.660 --> 13:31.562
Happy Thanksgiving!
What took you so long?!

13:31.639 --> 13:33.832
Teddy, uh,
wh-what happened to you?

13:33.909 --> 13:35.556
What? When? What? Yes.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.359
You look like you just got beat
up by an Edward Scissorhand.

13:38.436 --> 13:40.825
I was rushing around, trying to
get everything ready for today,

13:40.882 --> 13:42.696
and I caught my shirt
on the dresser handle,

13:42.773 --> 13:44.285
and I turned around
to look what happened

13:44.342 --> 13:45.663
and I went smack,
right into the door!

13:45.720 --> 13:47.534
Oh. What happened to your cheek?

13:47.611 --> 13:49.673
I was trying to shave
with an old razor.

13:49.752 --> 13:51.197
I tried to tough it out, but I...

13:51.361 --> 13:53.320
But it just got more and more
painful, so I stopped.

13:53.377 --> 13:54.334
Is it noticeable?

13:54.392 --> 13:55.686
Yeah, but you're making it work.

13:55.763 --> 13:56.921
I smell something funky.

13:56.998 --> 13:58.379
Ew. What is that?

13:58.456 --> 14:00.658
Eh, it's probably me.
I get panic stink.

14:00.791 --> 14:02.360
I-I don't think
that's a real thing.

14:02.437 --> 14:04.134
- It is.
- Oh, it's real.

14:04.197 --> 14:06.486
What? It just smells
kind of like my locker.

14:06.744 --> 14:08.279
- Oh, no.
- And now you know.

14:08.337 --> 14:10.518
Well, uh, maybe-maybe
take a shower.

14:10.576 --> 14:13.314
I already had two.
It just spreads the smell around.

14:13.404 --> 14:15.006
Well, once I get the food going,

14:15.083 --> 14:17.431
all anyone will smell
is delicious turkey.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.277
Time to take back Thanksgiving!

14:19.354 --> 14:22.236
Get ready for
Turkey 2: Judgment Day!

14:22.313 --> 14:24.509
All right, let me get you
a new shirt and, uh,

14:24.634 --> 14:25.993
maybe wipe the blood
off your face.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.072
Oh, wait. What about some
place cards for the table?

14:28.129 --> 14:29.740
That would spruce
this sucker up a little.

14:29.797 --> 14:30.944
Good one, T.

14:31.002 --> 14:32.603
Teddy, I'll go grab you a shirt.

14:32.673 --> 14:33.838
Can you write in cursive?

14:33.896 --> 14:35.936
Yeah, but this seems like
a bubble letter situation.

14:36.097 --> 14:38.712
- A BLS.
- So what are the names of your family?

14:38.770 --> 14:41.029
My sister and her husband
are Dana and Dan.

14:41.126 --> 14:43.829
Just put "Mom" for my mom...
She'll know what that means.

14:43.898 --> 14:46.914
And her boyfriend, oh, uh,
have I never used his name?

14:47.038 --> 14:48.795
Me and my sister
just call him Boytoy,

14:48.853 --> 14:50.448
but we can't write that.
Can we write that?!

14:50.505 --> 14:51.830
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

14:51.888 --> 14:53.978
Let's just take a shot
and go with... Terry.

14:54.055 --> 14:55.735
Okay, here you go.
Just slip this on.

14:55.797 --> 14:57.557
- Thanks, Linda.
- Oh, the smell.

14:57.615 --> 14:59.170
Here, I brought some aftershave
for that.

14:59.227 --> 15:01.185
Ooh. Now let me just
flick your pits.

15:01.243 --> 15:02.577
- Ha! Flick it.
- Right. Yeah, put it in there.

15:02.634 --> 15:03.704
Okay. All right.

15:03.762 --> 15:05.227
And a little on the cheeks.

15:05.285 --> 15:07.045
- It burns! It burns!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:07.135 --> 15:08.382
Ah. Oh, it stopped.

15:08.459 --> 15:09.704
So where should we put
these bad boys?

15:09.761 --> 15:11.548
Definitely put my sister
next to her husband,

15:11.606 --> 15:12.954
and my mom next to "Terry."

15:13.031 --> 15:14.540
But who should I sit between?

15:14.618 --> 15:16.023
Well, how do you usually do it?

15:16.100 --> 15:18.369
Well, when I was a kid,
I'd just sit between my parents,

15:18.446 --> 15:20.361
- so they wouldn't argue so much.
- Did it work?

15:20.438 --> 15:22.141
Sometimes. But, boy,
could they yell.

15:22.259 --> 15:23.341
They would yell and yell,

15:23.399 --> 15:24.963
and then my neighbors
would yell, "Shut up!"

15:25.020 --> 15:26.333
And my mom would yell back,

15:26.410 --> 15:28.046
"Mind your own business,
Finellis,

15:28.123 --> 15:30.114
because you had problems
last week!"

15:30.191 --> 15:31.821
Linda, can I get a hand in here?

15:31.917 --> 15:34.579
Teddy, hold that sad thought
for one sec. I'll be right back.

15:35.032 --> 15:36.665
Would you, uh,
give the potatoes a stir?

15:36.723 --> 15:37.930
- I'm-I'm covered in poultry.
- Okay.

15:37.987 --> 15:39.821
Oh, God, what are you doing?

15:39.979 --> 15:41.569
I-I'm taking out the backbone.

15:41.670 --> 15:43.839
It's how you get the turkey flat
for spatchcocking.

15:43.971 --> 15:46.743
What? -I-I thought you'd want
to see me do it. -

15:47.298 --> 15:49.867
Why is everyone so disgusted
by turkey preparation?

15:49.944 --> 15:51.692
- It's beautiful.
- No.

15:51.769 --> 15:54.238
Okay, but just watch this, Lin.
I have to crack the chest.

15:54.330 --> 15:56.122
You have to be
pretty strong to do this.

15:56.184 --> 15:58.272
Good thing I... spatchcock!

15:58.340 --> 15:59.764
- Oh, my face!
- Did I get ya?

15:59.936 --> 16:01.869
I think it splat... Yes!
Oh, right in my mouth.

16:01.946 --> 16:03.370
Oh, wash it off quick. That's...

16:03.447 --> 16:05.031
Ugh, give me some wine.
Give me some wine. -Oh. Yeah.

16:05.088 --> 16:06.646
Give me the wine. Oh, oh.

16:06.861 --> 16:09.110
Ugh.
Mmm. Good wine.

16:09.421 --> 16:11.397
Good news, Teddy.
The dinner will be ready

16:11.545 --> 16:14.006
right before your family arrives
and it's gonna be perfect!

16:14.256 --> 16:15.272
Teddy?

16:15.342 --> 16:16.550
Kids, have you seen Teddy?

16:16.627 --> 16:18.886
- Not lately.
- We invited Teddy to join us

16:18.963 --> 16:20.940
on the floor,
but he hasn't RSVP'd.

16:20.998 --> 16:22.486
We're taking a little
table-setting break.

16:22.543 --> 16:25.236
You know, we just ate
an entire Thanksgiving meal

16:25.313 --> 16:27.571
and now you're making us
do stuff, right?

16:27.648 --> 16:29.407
- Teddy!
- Teddy, where are you?

16:29.484 --> 16:31.509
Is he in the bathroom?
Knock, knock.

16:31.586 --> 16:34.022
No. Why does he need
five plungers?

16:34.092 --> 16:35.241
For different moods.

16:35.350 --> 16:36.795
Oh, my God. Teddy's family

16:36.873 --> 16:38.249
is on their way,
and he's missing.

16:38.326 --> 16:40.334
This is awful!

16:41.199 --> 16:43.033
Oh, that's good.

16:45.456 --> 16:47.081
We looked in every room, twice.

16:47.158 --> 16:48.426
Where could Teddy have gone?

16:48.503 --> 16:50.451
Did you try tapping
his food bowl?

16:50.528 --> 16:52.144
This is bad.
His family's coming

16:52.202 --> 16:53.642
and the perfect turkey's
in the oven.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.599
He can't have gone far;
let's check outside.

16:55.866 --> 16:57.558
Teddy! Teddy!

16:57.747 --> 17:00.897
- Teddy!
- Here, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

17:01.116 --> 17:02.842
Teddy? Is that you?

17:02.913 --> 17:04.935
- No.
- Okay, sorry to bother you.

17:05.060 --> 17:06.351
Where is he?

17:09.188 --> 17:11.313
Hey, Teddy, what are you doing?

17:11.382 --> 17:13.240
Fixing the chair, obviously.

17:13.317 --> 17:15.618
Don't know how it got in here;
it's perfectly good.

17:15.688 --> 17:18.304
Uh, okay, but is this
a good time to do that?

17:18.388 --> 17:20.621
It's a great time. I'm just
fixing a couple of things.

17:20.679 --> 17:22.560
Maybe I'm gonna move 'em
upstairs if I want to.

17:22.637 --> 17:24.976
Or it might be easier
to just move a couple things

17:25.061 --> 17:27.421
from upstairs down here,
live in the Dumpster.

17:27.498 --> 17:29.171
- Cheaper rent.
- Great light.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.913
Kids, no. Teddy's not living
in the Dumpster.

17:32.023 --> 17:33.843
Yeah, Teddy. This stuff
is going to the dump.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.499
A-And you need to come upstairs.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.855
This can't go to the dump, Bob.
It's not trash.

17:37.913 --> 17:39.266
All this stuff can be fixed.

17:39.343 --> 17:41.479
You don't just give up on stuff;
you can fix it.

17:41.556 --> 17:44.848
It might be okay to give up
on the half a waffle maker.

17:44.925 --> 17:47.551
I'm saving that
until I find the other half.

17:47.628 --> 17:49.210
I'm a fixer, I fix things.

17:49.287 --> 17:50.644
I've always been a fixer.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.723
I'm gonna fix
that waffle maker soon.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.350
Oh, my God,
I'm having a brain-smart.

17:56.562 --> 17:58.598
Teddy, you sat between
your parents

17:58.656 --> 17:59.830
when they would argue.

17:59.907 --> 18:01.355
You were the peacemaker.

18:01.432 --> 18:03.957
- You were trying to fix things.
- Oh, yeah.

18:04.034 --> 18:06.837
Your mom and dad are the two
halves of the waffle maker.

18:06.914 --> 18:08.329
That makes you a waffle.

18:08.406 --> 18:10.108
It's probably why you like
butter so much.

18:10.185 --> 18:12.066
Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry.

18:12.143 --> 18:13.511
We did this all too fast.

18:13.588 --> 18:15.079
We pushed you too hard.

18:15.156 --> 18:17.338
Yeah.
You were just trying to help.

18:17.415 --> 18:18.916
In kind of a judgey way.

18:18.993 --> 18:21.175
Well, if keeping stuff to fix

18:21.252 --> 18:24.021
helps get you through the day,
then what's the big deal?

18:24.098 --> 18:25.746
It isn't hurting anybody, right?

18:25.823 --> 18:27.248
Yeah, we all have our things.

18:27.325 --> 18:28.959
Dad gets weird about
Thanksgiving.

18:29.036 --> 18:30.394
I-I don't get weird.

18:30.471 --> 18:33.520
I care too much,
Tina be shopping. -What?

18:33.597 --> 18:34.960
Mom has her wine.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.247
Oh, there it is.
Thank you, Gene.

18:36.304 --> 18:37.402
But this isn't my thing.

18:37.460 --> 18:39.254
I mean, Thanksgiving happens
once a year.

18:39.312 --> 18:41.492
It's not weird to try
and make it perfect.

18:41.624 --> 18:43.107
You guys are weird.

18:43.312 --> 18:44.562
Hello.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.085
Oh, hey. Nothing.

18:47.374 --> 18:49.099
What do you mean it sounds like
I'm in a Dumpster?

18:49.156 --> 18:52.624
It's just kinda echo-y in here
because of my couch.

18:52.781 --> 18:55.008
Oh. It did?
Yeah, that happens.

18:55.085 --> 18:57.992
Okay, then I-I guess
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

18:58.077 --> 18:59.262
That was my sister.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.414
My mom missed her flight,

19:00.491 --> 19:01.979
and now my sister is staying
near the airport

19:02.036 --> 19:03.794
so she can pick her up
in the morning.

19:03.871 --> 19:06.053
- Oh, no. -Oh.
- No. This is great.

19:06.130 --> 19:08.399
I'm off the hook.
Them coming tomorrow is better.

19:08.476 --> 19:09.567
Tomorrow's better?

19:09.644 --> 19:11.125
Tomorrow's way better.

19:11.202 --> 19:13.887
No pressure for a perfect meal
or perfect setting.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.324
We'll just hang out.

19:15.382 --> 19:17.531
Uh, I-I guess it's-it's great.

19:17.608 --> 19:19.793
Just, um, that was
a lot of work,

19:19.851 --> 19:21.249
completely for nothing.

19:21.307 --> 19:22.340
I'll get over it.

19:22.398 --> 19:24.613
But, Teddy, now you're alone
on Thanksgiving.

19:24.671 --> 19:27.474
I'm fine. I'm just gonna bring
some of my stuff back upstairs.

19:27.551 --> 19:29.286
Wait, the turkey's gonna be
ready in an hour,

19:29.343 --> 19:31.689
and you have a whole
Thanksgiving dinner up there,

19:31.766 --> 19:33.691
and, you know, we're here, so...

19:33.775 --> 19:36.657
Oh. Hey, then...
why don't you join me?

19:36.727 --> 19:37.881
- We already ate.
- Oh, we, uh...

19:37.938 --> 19:39.697
Yeah, that's a good idea,
Teddy. -Mm.

19:39.774 --> 19:42.324
Thank you. I mean,
we might as well stay, right?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.132
Aw, and we'll help you carry
the stuff you want back up.

19:45.202 --> 19:46.851
- Whoa. Whoa.
- I'm with her.

19:46.937 --> 19:49.316
Yeah, my arms are pretty tired
from writing the place cards.

19:49.374 --> 19:51.152
Kids, we're helping him.
Grab something.

19:51.217 --> 19:53.074
Hey, look, the other half
of the waffle maker.

19:53.132 --> 19:54.957
- You found it.
- New best thing.

19:55.015 --> 19:56.160
- I win!
- What?

19:56.218 --> 19:57.663
No. Drained 8-Ball.

19:57.726 --> 19:59.382
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

19:59.671 --> 20:00.818
Ow.

20:00.906 --> 20:02.653
We got to get
out of this Dumpster.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.777
Well, that was the last of it.

20:04.835 --> 20:07.460
The stuff you wanna keep is back
where it was. And then some.

20:07.531 --> 20:10.343
Okay, my redemption dinner
is served.

20:10.444 --> 20:11.804
Wait, did you bring broken

20:11.870 --> 20:13.202
chunks of concrete up
here?

20:13.273 --> 20:14.488
Yeah, that's good rebar.

20:14.565 --> 20:16.937
You just break off the concrete
and voilà.

20:17.109 --> 20:18.788
- Free rebar.
- Free-bar.

20:18.874 --> 20:21.320
O-Okay. Well, let's eat
while everything's hot.

20:21.382 --> 20:23.999
It does smell good.
Guess I could have a bite.

20:24.117 --> 20:25.238
I could take a nibble.

20:25.296 --> 20:27.335
If this is how I go,
this is how I go.

20:27.406 --> 20:29.488
Thank you guys for all your help
with my stuff.

20:29.557 --> 20:31.014
And putting up with my stuff.

20:31.091 --> 20:32.250
And making stuffing.

20:32.327 --> 20:34.101
- It means a lot.
- Of course.

20:34.218 --> 20:35.919
Okay, everyone,
let's focus on the food.

20:35.996 --> 20:39.357
I mean, we're all here for
Teddy, of course, but dig in.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.717
Oh.
Mmm, Bobby.

20:41.819 --> 20:43.505
This is really good.

20:43.569 --> 20:45.169
Mmm. This is amazing, Bob.

20:45.239 --> 20:46.653
Mmm. It really is.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.468
- Are you crying?
- No.

20:48.577 --> 20:50.873
I'm-I'm... I'm just so happy.

20:51.006 --> 20:52.449
This is so good
I'm gonna wish for

20:52.507 --> 20:54.265
a second stomach.
Where's the wishbone?

20:54.323 --> 20:56.514
