Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:31.115 --> 01:33.215
How you feeling?

01:33.217 --> 01:36.218
Fine, thanks for your concern.

01:36.220 --> 01:38.920
You don't look fine.

01:38.922 --> 01:41.055
You look off color.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.457
Kinda pale.

01:42.459 --> 01:46.063
The fuck?

01:52.402 --> 01:56.438
As I was saying, you
look pale.

01:56.440 --> 02:00.245
Maybe that's because
you drive like a dick.

02:03.681 --> 02:07.152
Just don't embarrass me again
tonight.

02:45.156 --> 02:46.956
Who do I have to fuck to get one
of those?

02:46.958 --> 02:50.959
Mitchell, we need your
special talents over here.

02:50.961 --> 02:52.528
Make yourself useful,
get the man a coffee.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.162
Black, two sugars.

02:54.164 --> 02:56.165
A large one, darling.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.565
I really need to get one of
those.

02:57.567 --> 02:58.466
I thought you already had one.

02:58.468 --> 02:59.368
You're joking.

02:59.370 --> 03:02.604
Her coffee tastes like shit.
Constable!

03:02.606 --> 03:04.172
No coffee, thanks.

03:04.174 --> 03:05.307
We've got work to do.

03:05.309 --> 03:06.507
Who called it in?

03:06.509 --> 03:08.209
Security guard.

03:08.211 --> 03:10.948
Found the body doing his rounds.

03:13.616 --> 03:15.416
He looks pretty shaken up.
Not surprising.

03:15.418 --> 03:17.488
You wait till you see it.

03:18.621 --> 03:21.290
Where's that bloody generator?

03:21.292 --> 03:22.725
Sorry, we're still getting set
up here,

03:22.727 --> 03:23.759
we have no power.

03:23.761 --> 03:25.594
Where's the body?
Cellar.

03:25.596 --> 03:28.096
Down the steps, follow your
nose.

03:28.098 --> 03:30.101
You're gonna need these.

03:45.249 --> 03:48.017
You're in for a
treat.

03:48.019 --> 03:48.952
Bloody?

03:48.954 --> 03:51.285
Like a menstruating virgin at a
gang bang.

03:51.287 --> 03:53.522
I'm not sure if it's the worst I
ever saw,

03:53.524 --> 03:54.356
but it's a contender.

03:54.358 --> 03:56.357
Maybe you should sit this one
out.

03:56.359 --> 03:58.459
I'll fill you in later.
I'm fine.

03:58.461 --> 04:00.095
The man has a point, you know?

04:00.097 --> 04:02.331
Even my stomach turned
over when I first saw it.

04:02.333 --> 04:05.299
You sure you're up for this?
I said I'm fine.

04:05.301 --> 04:06.667
Whoo.

04:06.669 --> 04:10.505
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's like
a tackle shop in there.

04:10.507 --> 04:12.408
What do you mean?

04:12.410 --> 04:15.079
It's like maggots everywhere.

04:15.813 --> 04:16.778
Oh man.

04:16.779 --> 04:18.382
Yeah, take a look.

04:21.785 --> 04:23.451
God, the Met should let
me freelance some of these

04:23.453 --> 04:25.254
to the National.

04:25.256 --> 04:27.422
I'd win a Terry O'Neil award.

04:30.294 --> 04:32.294
You sure you wanna go in there,
detective?

04:32.296 --> 04:34.095
So immature.

04:34.097 --> 04:35.730
I'm absolutely fine.

04:35.732 --> 04:37.732
I mean, we all know what
happened last time, right?

04:37.734 --> 04:39.535
I had stomach flu last time,
okay?

04:39.537 --> 04:40.235
You all know that.

04:40.237 --> 04:42.203
Have you got stomach flu today?

04:42.205 --> 04:44.208
Let's just do our job.

05:21.544 --> 05:23.444
At least you didn't
contaminate the crime scene

05:23.446 --> 05:24.314
this time.

05:27.150 --> 05:29.585
So, we've got a serial killer.

05:29.587 --> 05:31.520
You think so, genius?

05:31.522 --> 05:33.855
It's clearly the same MO as the
last one.

05:33.857 --> 05:35.424
I didn't realize you were Amish.

05:35.426 --> 05:36.624
Amish?

05:36.626 --> 05:38.360
Don't you own a TV?

05:38.362 --> 05:39.727
What are you talking about?

05:39.729 --> 05:41.396
'Cause even if you never
had to learn police work

05:41.398 --> 05:43.364
like the rest of us
plebs, anybody with a TV

05:43.366 --> 05:45.900
knows that it takes three
bodies to make a serial killer.

05:45.902 --> 05:49.237
You know what I'm saying,
you're just being pedantic.

05:49.239 --> 05:50.174
Pedantic?

05:51.275 --> 05:52.240
And here's me thinking that

05:52.242 --> 05:53.674
pedantic-ness is the
most important attribute

05:53.676 --> 05:56.347
of being a competent detective.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.747
Just tell me what we have.

05:59.749 --> 06:04.419
At a guess, I'd say he's
been here five or six weeks.

06:05.756 --> 06:08.256
I wouldn't touch that.

06:08.258 --> 06:09.191
Forensics?

06:09.193 --> 06:10.525
Leptospirosis.

06:10.527 --> 06:13.330
Rat piss, this place is
infested.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.239
Right, so, he was killed what,

06:25.241 --> 06:29.244
a month before the other one?
No shit, Sherlock.

06:29.246 --> 06:32.581
This work is much cruder
than the first one.

06:32.583 --> 06:36.186
The other one was more
controlled, neater.

06:37.253 --> 06:39.254
Looked almost surgical to me.

06:39.256 --> 06:41.256
Practice makes perfect.

06:41.258 --> 06:45.460
Have you noticed the most
obvious difference yet?

06:45.462 --> 06:46.895
Um.
Come on, detective.

06:46.897 --> 06:48.233
You can do it.

06:52.869 --> 06:54.636
The numbers.
What?

06:54.638 --> 06:56.605
The numbers on the wall.

06:56.607 --> 06:58.739
What are you talking about?

06:58.741 --> 07:00.742
The dates on the wall.

07:00.744 --> 07:04.412
They're different from the other
scene.

07:04.414 --> 07:05.616
No, the body.

07:14.857 --> 07:17.725
Has he removed the heart
from this one as well?

07:17.727 --> 07:19.927
Hard to tell before the autopsy.

07:19.929 --> 07:22.364
He's too far gone.

07:22.366 --> 07:24.732
There's blood around the head of
this one.

07:24.734 --> 07:28.603
That's not inconsistent with
having your guts ripped out.

07:28.605 --> 07:32.340
We're gonna be here all night,
put her out of her misery.

07:32.342 --> 07:33.641
Unlike the previous victim,

07:33.643 --> 07:35.811
this one hasn't been restrained.

07:35.813 --> 07:37.379
Drugged?

07:37.381 --> 07:38.980
I hope so.

07:38.982 --> 07:40.581
We'll run
the usual pathology tests

07:40.583 --> 07:43.321
but given the state of the body,

07:44.321 --> 07:46.754
we might never find out for
certain.

07:46.756 --> 07:49.658
So do you think he was
alive when he was cut open?

07:49.660 --> 07:50.929
It's possible.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.603
Ready for your close up?

08:00.938 --> 08:02.037
It's a coincidence.

08:02.039 --> 08:03.771
My wife is cooking ribs tonight.

08:03.773 --> 08:06.540
Give it a rest, Perkins.

08:06.542 --> 08:09.544
So, similarities.

08:09.546 --> 08:11.679
Both male, both IC1.

08:11.681 --> 08:15.650
Both late 20s, same height, both
athletic.

08:15.652 --> 08:18.920
Both locations had the
same satanic markings.

08:18.922 --> 08:19.787
Satanic?

08:19.789 --> 08:21.756
Like the pope flexing his pecs
to me.

08:21.758 --> 08:24.759
You're telling me that
doesn't look like a cock?

08:24.761 --> 08:26.862
You must have
one weird looking cock.

08:26.864 --> 08:29.364
Don't act like you don't
what his cock looks like.

08:29.366 --> 08:30.501
Guys, focus.

08:32.068 --> 08:32.937
Jesus.

08:34.571 --> 08:36.038
This means we're most likely

08:36.039 --> 08:38.806
dealing with the same
perpetrator.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.842
Victim one, the heart was
removed.

08:41.845 --> 08:43.645
From the victim or the murder
scene?

08:43.647 --> 08:45.347
Both, actually.

08:45.349 --> 08:47.381
The assumption is it's
the same of victim two

08:47.383 --> 08:50.852
but we're still awaiting the
autopsy for confirmation.

08:50.854 --> 08:52.554
And where was the first victim
found?

08:52.556 --> 08:54.522
At home, in the basement.

08:54.524 --> 08:56.091
Nice surprise for his
poor old cleaning lady

08:56.093 --> 08:58.059
when she went in and found the
body.

08:58.061 --> 08:59.493
Any murder weapon?

08:59.495 --> 09:01.796
It looks like the killer
used surgical tools.

09:01.798 --> 09:03.598
Bone saw, scalpel.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.700
So maybe he was a doctor?

09:05.702 --> 09:07.636
Jack the Ripper was a doctor.

09:07.638 --> 09:10.005
Jack the Ripper was a lord,
aristocracy.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.373
Jack the Ripper was
a barber.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.541
A barber?

09:13.543 --> 09:16.614
Aw, that's Sweeny Todd.
Sweeny Todd.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.580
I'm not a complete retard.

09:19.582 --> 09:22.483
Aaron Kosminski, Polish barber.

09:22.485 --> 09:24.920
DNA evidence proves he
was Jack the Ripper.

09:24.922 --> 09:25.790
Enough!

09:26.757 --> 09:29.091
If anybody mentions Jack the
Ripper again,

09:29.093 --> 09:32.861
especially outside this
room, they're suspended.

09:32.863 --> 09:33.862
The last thing we need

09:33.864 --> 09:36.964
is for the press to blow
this out of proportion

09:36.966 --> 09:39.601
and get us swamped with
mentally ill people

09:39.603 --> 09:41.673
making false confessions.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.072
Occupations?

09:44.074 --> 09:46.141
Victim one was a doctor.

09:46.143 --> 09:49.810
He spent the last three
years saving the world,

09:49.812 --> 09:53.950
volunteer medic in the back
of beyond, Central America.

09:54.951 --> 09:58.019
He'd only been back in the
country a couple of weeks.

09:58.021 --> 09:59.420
Welcome home.

09:59.422 --> 10:02.123
Victim two had only been in the
country

10:02.125 --> 10:04.025
for two months, too.

10:04.027 --> 10:05.761
Any sexual assault?

10:05.763 --> 10:08.396
Not from the first victim.

10:08.398 --> 10:11.132
But, again, awaiting
autopsy on victim two.

10:11.134 --> 10:12.867
Maybe the killer's homophobic.

10:12.869 --> 10:15.102
We don't know the second victim
was gay.

10:15.104 --> 10:16.271
Oh, come on.

10:16.273 --> 10:19.073
What straight guy ever spent
that much time in the gym?

10:19.075 --> 10:20.909
Well, that's one thing you can
establish

10:20.911 --> 10:24.679
when you interview all known
associates.

10:24.681 --> 10:26.647
Are we gonna find anything
useful in this file

10:26.649 --> 10:28.549
or is it just another bunch of
dead leads?

10:28.551 --> 10:29.918
Oh, you've learned to read?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.986
They're not dead,

10:30.988 --> 10:32.120
they're leads that are
still being investigated,

10:32.122 --> 10:33.988
and we have a new one.

10:33.990 --> 10:36.190
There was a date on the
floor at the first scene.

10:36.192 --> 10:38.160
It was scratched into the
concrete.

10:38.162 --> 10:39.761
Before now, we just
assumed it was put there

10:39.763 --> 10:41.563
by the builders.
And now?

10:41.565 --> 10:44.866
We found this date on the wall
last night.

10:44.868 --> 10:45.967
See how similar they are?

10:45.969 --> 10:47.001
Do we know what it means?

10:47.003 --> 10:50.872
No, not yet, we only
just made the connection.

10:50.874 --> 10:52.506
Assuming they are dates.

10:52.508 --> 10:54.543
I mean, this is not a monarchy,
you know?

10:54.545 --> 10:56.645
So, the cock pope.

10:56.647 --> 10:58.880
Have you got any idea what
it's actually supposed to be?

10:58.882 --> 11:01.116
Sigil of Beelzebub.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.516
Voodoo mumbo jumbo.

11:02.518 --> 11:03.751
What about the circle of salt?

11:03.753 --> 11:06.655
It's a barrier against dark
forces.

11:06.657 --> 11:07.988
Voodoo mumbo jumbo.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.958
Psychological profile?
He's a nutter.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.593
There's a full profile report in
the file.

11:12.595 --> 11:14.862
Forensics?
File.

11:14.864 --> 11:16.731
Nothing so far.

11:16.733 --> 11:19.000
He's either very careful or very
lucky.

11:19.002 --> 11:20.101
And what about the second scene?

11:20.103 --> 11:22.771
File.
Nothing as yet.

11:22.773 --> 11:25.140
But it was two months old.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.708
Rats had been at the body.

11:26.710 --> 11:29.678
So, let's manage our
expectations

11:29.680 --> 11:31.646
on finding anything useful
there.

11:31.648 --> 11:33.247
And we're definitely sure
this is the same guy?

11:33.249 --> 11:34.248
For God's sake,

11:34.250 --> 11:35.950
look, inspector, we've
got everything covered.

11:35.952 --> 11:37.586
Do we really need Laurel and
Hardy here

11:37.588 --> 11:38.920
getting in the way of the
investigation?

11:38.922 --> 11:40.121
If you had everything covered,

11:40.123 --> 11:41.923
we wouldn't have another murder
victim.

11:41.925 --> 11:42.823
Fuck off.

11:42.825 --> 11:45.193
Oh, the glory hound getting
pissed off

11:45.195 --> 11:46.828
that the professionals are
muscling in

11:46.830 --> 11:48.729
on his first real serial killer?

11:48.731 --> 11:50.899
It's not a serial killer,
there are only two bodies.

11:50.901 --> 11:52.534
Actually, that's a common
misconception

11:52.536 --> 11:55.871
propagated by lazy American TV
shows.

11:55.873 --> 11:57.905
The official definition
is two or more killings

11:57.907 --> 11:59.940
separated by a cooling off
period.

12:01.244 --> 12:02.113
Enough.

12:03.279 --> 12:06.483
We're a team, so let's act like
one.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.684
Look into the numbers
scratched on the wall.

12:09.686 --> 12:12.020
Find out what he's trying to
tell us.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.756
Victim two, all known
associates.

12:14.758 --> 12:17.726
Find out who had access to the
building.

12:27.571 --> 12:29.069
So how long have you worked at
the site?

12:29.071 --> 12:30.738
Five months.

12:30.740 --> 12:31.805
What do you do?

12:31.807 --> 12:33.040
I'm a security guard.

12:33.042 --> 12:37.178
Yes, but what does that entail,
exactly?

12:37.180 --> 12:38.313
I sit in the booth

12:38.315 --> 12:40.549
from eight in the evening
till eight in the morning.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.784
And once every hour,

12:41.786 --> 12:43.785
I walk around with a torch so
people see that I am there.

12:43.787 --> 12:45.185
What do you do the rest of the
time?

12:45.187 --> 12:47.991
I like to read about astronomy.

12:51.595 --> 12:53.328
So you work nights.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.295
Any day shifts?

12:54.297 --> 12:55.697
That is Simon.

12:55.699 --> 12:58.132
We play chess, one move a day.

12:58.134 --> 12:59.266
We are still on our first game.

12:59.268 --> 13:01.870
Just the two of you?
Yes.

13:01.872 --> 13:03.137
What about your days off?

13:03.139 --> 13:04.872
I can't afford days off.

13:04.874 --> 13:07.141
Why did it take five
weeks to find the body?

13:07.143 --> 13:08.709
We don't patrol inside the
factory.

13:08.711 --> 13:10.679
It's derelict, locked up, you
were there.

13:10.681 --> 13:13.280
So why did you go in last night
then?

13:13.282 --> 13:15.750
I heard a noise.
What kind of noise?

13:15.752 --> 13:19.688
A strange noise, scraping.
Scraping?

13:19.690 --> 13:21.589
Sometimes you hear noises.

13:21.591 --> 13:23.757
Sometimes rats, sometimes foxes.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.760
Sometimes your mind playing
tricks.

13:25.762 --> 13:27.362
So why did you choose to
investigate

13:27.364 --> 13:29.164
this particular noise?

13:29.166 --> 13:32.900
It was a loud noise, like
nothing before.

13:32.902 --> 13:35.303
Like pipes scraping on the
floor.

13:35.305 --> 13:37.905
Maybe like someone stealing
scrap metal.

13:37.907 --> 13:40.107
So I have a look, this is my
job.

13:40.109 --> 13:42.644
And what did you see?

13:42.646 --> 13:44.212
A sight from hell.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.215
Same as you.

13:46.115 --> 13:47.348
Did you touch the body?

13:47.350 --> 13:49.284
Of course I did not touch the
body.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.285
I got out and called you
straight away.

13:51.287 --> 13:52.654
Did you see the markings?

13:52.656 --> 13:55.726
The witchcraft, symbols on the
walls?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.828
Where I'm from, even in Lusaka,

13:59.830 --> 14:02.030
witchcraft is an everyday thing.

14:02.032 --> 14:04.131
You see the pastor on Sunday.

14:04.133 --> 14:07.135
You see the witch doctor on
Wednesday.

14:07.137 --> 14:10.738
I've seen witchcraft, good and
bad.

14:10.740 --> 14:14.878
And I'll tell you now, sir,
that was not witchcraft.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.813
Where can we find your chess
opponent?

14:18.815 --> 14:21.716
That is some crazy Satan shit
right there.

14:21.718 --> 14:23.651
How do you know the details
of the murder scene?

14:23.653 --> 14:24.886
Tony told me.

14:24.888 --> 14:26.420
He sent home from work.

14:26.422 --> 14:30.290
The pigs, police have it all
cordoned off.

14:30.292 --> 14:31.992
He'd better bloody well
pay me for today as well,

14:31.994 --> 14:34.731
the tight bastard.
Who's Tony?

14:37.401 --> 14:39.367
I feel really bad about this.

14:39.369 --> 14:41.969
Really bad, it's terrible.

14:41.971 --> 14:44.238
Why do you feel terrible?

14:44.240 --> 14:46.440
Because it doesn't look
good for a security company

14:46.442 --> 14:48.309
if the site they are guarding

14:48.311 --> 14:51.713
becomes the scene of some
kind of ritual killing.

14:51.715 --> 14:54.149
I guess it doesn't.

14:54.151 --> 14:57.888
We could lose a lot of business
over this.

14:59.355 --> 15:02.225
And bad for the victim, of
course.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.729
I am so sorry I haven't
offered you any refreshments.

15:08.731 --> 15:09.698
Would you care for a cup of tea?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.867
I'm fine, thank you.
Do you have any coffee?

15:12.869 --> 15:14.468
Sorry, I'm gonna have to make
it.

15:14.470 --> 15:18.006
We're not that type of set up
that can afford assistants.

15:18.008 --> 15:19.708
Or coffee machines.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.942
How do you take it?

15:20.944 --> 15:22.176
Black, two sugars.

15:22.178 --> 15:24.813
So who exactly has access to the
site?

15:24.815 --> 15:26.684
Just Femi and Simon.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.049
And you obviously.

15:29.051 --> 15:30.787
Well, yes, and me.

15:31.955 --> 15:34.889
And what about
holiday cover?

15:34.891 --> 15:38.025
No one's gone on holiday
for the past four months.

15:38.027 --> 15:40.428
It's just Simon and Femi, that's
it.

15:40.430 --> 15:42.764
So they've worked 12-hour
shifts, seven days a week

15:42.766 --> 15:44.998
for the past four months, no
time off?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.102
Zero-hour contracts.

15:47.104 --> 15:48.303
It's perfectly legal.

15:48.305 --> 15:50.038
It's the only thing that's kept
us afloat

15:50.040 --> 15:52.140
since the economy crashed.

15:52.142 --> 15:54.976
Why no security cameras?

15:54.978 --> 15:56.810
No point, it's a derelict site.

15:56.812 --> 16:00.948
Plus, we'd be doing
ourselves out of a job.

16:00.950 --> 16:02.117
So what you're saying is

16:02.119 --> 16:04.852
we have a murder in a locked up
site

16:04.854 --> 16:07.288
that only three people have
access to?

16:07.290 --> 16:08.825
Well, we three.

16:11.527 --> 16:14.762
And the owners of course.
I thought you owned it.

16:14.764 --> 16:16.197
You're joking, aren't you?

16:16.199 --> 16:17.766
We just do security.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.367
If I was some sort of
millionaire property baron,

16:19.369 --> 16:22.773
do you think I'd be drinking
this shit?

16:23.974 --> 16:26.306
So who does own it?

16:43.527 --> 16:45.959
Sanderson Lisle please.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.298
Do you have an appointment?

17:03.213 --> 17:04.214
47 floors.

17:06.315 --> 17:08.848
How high is that in meters?

17:08.851 --> 17:10.983
Although, to be honest, I
would prefer the cable to break

17:10.986 --> 17:15.125
than get trapped in here
and slowly starve to death.

17:16.892 --> 17:19.762
Although you'd buy me a few
weeks.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.166
Hello.
Susan from Straub here.

17:27.169 --> 17:28.869
Bad news about the sale.

17:28.871 --> 17:30.305
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

17:30.307 --> 17:31.539
Tiny little hiccup.

17:31.541 --> 17:34.011
Your buyers have pulled out.

17:35.110 --> 17:38.346
But how can they pull out now?

17:38.348 --> 17:41.415
We've signed a contract,
we complete on Friday.

17:41.417 --> 17:43.184
These things
happen all the time.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.286
They said their loan fell
through and...

17:45.288 --> 17:47.454
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but that's
bullshit.

17:47.456 --> 17:49.223
You told me they were cash
buyers.

17:49.225 --> 17:51.158
Oh there was a chain
involved.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.126
Yeah, well, then you misled me.

17:53.128 --> 17:54.529
Yeah, it will be fine.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.930
We care about your experience...

17:55.932 --> 17:58.066
I can't deal with this right
now.

17:58.068 --> 17:59.434
We'll sort it out.
Yep.

17:59.436 --> 18:02.403
So, should I
put it back on the market?

18:02.405 --> 18:03.570
Yeah.

18:03.572 --> 18:06.241
Well, what choice do I have?

18:06.243 --> 18:07.541
Don't worry, Miss
Faraway.

18:07.543 --> 18:10.043
Everything is going to be fine.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.245
Okay.

18:11.247 --> 18:12.646
Call you later?
Yep.

18:12.648 --> 18:15.116
After work?
Put it back on the market.

18:15.118 --> 18:16.283
We've got it under control.

18:16.285 --> 18:17.151
It's a hot market.
Thank you.

18:17.153 --> 18:18.485
We'll have that house sold

18:18.487 --> 18:21.289
before you even notice.
Bye.

18:21.291 --> 18:22.924
Idiots.

18:22.926 --> 18:24.259
What was that about?

18:24.261 --> 18:26.263
None of your business.

18:34.971 --> 18:39.240
Detectives, Vera Mason,
property portfolio manager.

18:39.242 --> 18:40.974
How can I be of assistance?

18:40.976 --> 18:42.577
We're here to talk about Kingley
Street.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.444
Quite.

18:43.446 --> 18:47.482
Let's go somewhere a little more
private.

18:47.484 --> 18:48.619
Bloody hell.

18:50.020 --> 18:52.520
Please, take a seat.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.055
Could I tempt you with a coffee?

18:54.057 --> 18:55.188
No, thank you.

18:55.190 --> 18:57.224
Our chef roasts the beans
himself.

18:57.226 --> 18:58.126
We have a lot of work to do,

18:58.128 --> 18:59.661
so we'll just ask you a few
questions

18:59.663 --> 19:01.462
and then be on our way.

19:01.464 --> 19:03.463
So how long have you owned
Kingley Street?

19:03.465 --> 19:06.134
We acquired it back on
June 16th last year,

19:06.136 --> 19:07.935
so nearly 10 months ago.

19:07.937 --> 19:09.436
And why did you
purchase it?

19:09.438 --> 19:11.138
Because we invest in property.

19:11.140 --> 19:12.473
How often do you visit the site?

19:12.475 --> 19:13.473
Not often at all.

19:13.475 --> 19:14.608
When did you last visit?

19:14.610 --> 19:16.144
Me personally?

19:16.146 --> 19:17.244
Never.

19:17.246 --> 19:19.280
Well, not since we completed
the purchase last year.

19:19.282 --> 19:21.214
There's no reason for me to go
there.

19:21.216 --> 19:22.183
So other than yourself,

19:22.185 --> 19:24.018
who else has access to the site?

19:24.020 --> 19:25.052
Well, everybody.

19:25.054 --> 19:26.220
The keys aren't locked away.

19:26.222 --> 19:27.555
And I assume you have some sort
of system

19:27.557 --> 19:29.223
to record who takes them?

19:29.225 --> 19:30.157
Site visit log.

19:30.159 --> 19:32.026
Everything's automated, fairly
standard.

19:32.028 --> 19:33.328
Can we see it?

19:33.330 --> 19:35.163
Sure, I guess so.

19:35.165 --> 19:36.998
I'll just have to check that
with my...

19:37.000 --> 19:39.399
So you've finally taken my job.

19:39.401 --> 19:41.636
Still working on that.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.370
No, this was an unscheduled
visit.

19:43.372 --> 19:45.173
All the board rooms are
occupied.

19:45.175 --> 19:47.607
This is Mr. Sweet, our partner
in charge.

19:47.609 --> 19:48.675
These are detectives...

19:48.677 --> 19:50.645
Faraway and Smith.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.512
Detectives.

19:52.514 --> 19:54.081
Don't worry, I can provide the
alibi.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.649
She was with me all night.

19:55.651 --> 19:57.719
In your dreams.

19:57.721 --> 20:00.187
We're here to talk about Kingley
Street.

20:00.189 --> 20:01.055
Of course you are.

20:01.057 --> 20:02.255
I heard about that.

20:02.257 --> 20:03.390
Awful.

20:03.392 --> 20:05.492
We were just requesting
access to your site visit log.

20:05.494 --> 20:06.594
Access granted.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.495
Vera will arrange that right
away.

20:08.497 --> 20:12.635
Detectives, my office is
entirely at your disposal.

20:15.671 --> 20:17.571
How is it my fault?

20:17.573 --> 20:19.240
The buyer dropped out.

20:19.242 --> 20:21.009
All the contracts are
signed.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.376
That's what I thought too.

20:22.378 --> 20:24.212
But you know what, shit happens.

20:24.214 --> 20:26.280
Look, I'm the one dealing
with the estate agent.

20:26.282 --> 20:27.447
I mean...
Hold on.

20:27.449 --> 20:28.281
Excuse me, I have a
prescription.

20:28.283 --> 20:30.617
What have you done?
I said, hold on!

20:30.619 --> 20:31.485
I need to move on with my
life.

20:31.487 --> 20:32.720
This is expired.
What?

20:32.722 --> 20:34.321
It's out of date.

20:34.323 --> 20:36.357
You'll need to go see your
doctor and have it renewed.

20:36.359 --> 20:38.158
But it's a repeat prescription.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.163
Yeah and it's expired.

20:41.164 --> 20:42.329
Can I help?
Hello?

20:42.331 --> 20:44.499
Look, it's not like you can
get high off these things.

20:44.501 --> 20:46.033
What's the big deal?

20:46.035 --> 20:47.335
It's called the law.

20:47.337 --> 20:50.738
You're not trying
to get back together.

20:50.740 --> 20:51.973
I am the law.

20:51.975 --> 20:56.711
Well, then why are you trying
to get me to commit a crime?

20:56.713 --> 20:57.578
Can you hear me?

20:57.580 --> 20:58.412
Look, okay.

20:58.414 --> 21:00.647
Things at my work are really
hard.

21:00.649 --> 21:03.384
I just, I really need these
pills.

21:03.386 --> 21:04.385
Steve!

21:04.387 --> 21:05.522
Yes?

21:07.157 --> 21:08.755
Well, can you come out here,
Steve?

21:08.757 --> 21:10.191
If you think you could do a
better job

21:10.193 --> 21:12.326
then you call the estate agent
yourself.

21:12.328 --> 21:14.628
Yeah, take responsibility for
something

21:14.630 --> 21:16.364
once in your stupid...

21:16.366 --> 21:17.598
Can't I just have a tea break?

21:17.600 --> 21:18.601
Excuse me.

21:19.535 --> 21:21.469
Thanks.
Hello?

21:21.471 --> 21:22.569
Look, are you listening?

21:22.571 --> 21:24.204
This is expired.
Are you there?

21:24.206 --> 21:26.808
Oh Jesus, just give me
the pills, will you?

21:26.810 --> 21:28.675
Why didn't you just tell her
to go and get it renewed?

21:28.677 --> 21:29.810
What are you doing?

21:29.812 --> 21:31.546
I can't deal with this right
now.

21:31.548 --> 21:32.413
Who's there with...

21:32.415 --> 21:33.748
Wanker!

21:33.750 --> 21:34.449
Excuse me?

21:34.451 --> 21:37.318
Sorry, not you, that was my ex.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.056
I don't blame him.

21:49.698 --> 21:50.566
Oh shit.

22:31.875 --> 22:32.874
This crazy fucker

22:32.876 --> 22:35.710
is building some kind of
Frankenstein's monster.

22:35.712 --> 22:37.411
Or he's making a pie.

22:37.413 --> 22:38.646
That's an interesting theory.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.313
Have you got an alibi for last
night?

22:40.315 --> 22:41.549
I'm not gonna lie to you.

22:41.551 --> 22:43.917
I was at home all night eating.

22:43.919 --> 22:45.455
Out your ex-wife.

22:49.826 --> 22:50.694
Too soon?

22:53.163 --> 22:54.694
Well, it rules out the
homophobic theory.

22:54.696 --> 22:55.562
What are you talking about?

22:55.564 --> 22:57.231
Well, it's not one of them lady
boys.

22:57.233 --> 22:59.666
You'd be the expert.

22:59.668 --> 23:01.234
So this was done last night?

23:01.236 --> 23:04.437
Yes, the core is
still warm.

23:04.439 --> 23:06.307
First signs of rigor.

23:06.309 --> 23:09.510
So we can rule out the
date theory then, too.

23:09.512 --> 23:11.311
Bit late for her last rites.

23:11.313 --> 23:13.614
Prepared to be impressed.

23:13.616 --> 23:17.385
Shit, there's not enough
chapters, dammit.

23:17.387 --> 23:19.353
Just wait, let me check the Old
Testament.

23:19.355 --> 23:20.922
Cause of death?

23:20.924 --> 23:22.356
She's got no eyes.

23:22.358 --> 23:24.192
Yeah, I can see that.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.793
But surely eye removal wouldn't
lead to this much bleeding.

23:26.795 --> 23:28.197
Right, Faraway?

23:29.898 --> 23:30.900
Epistaxis.

23:33.468 --> 23:35.703
The mother of all nosebleeds.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.239
Besides that and the eyes,

23:38.241 --> 23:40.308
no other signs of physical
trauma.

23:40.310 --> 23:42.475
Can you die from a nosebleed?

23:42.477 --> 23:44.645
It's rare, but it
happens.

23:44.647 --> 23:46.713
The wrists aren't bound.

23:46.715 --> 23:47.581
Do you think you'll have more
luck

23:47.583 --> 23:48.716
with toxicology this time?

23:48.718 --> 23:52.819
Fresh body, we should know
if she was drugged or not.

23:52.821 --> 23:53.753
Yes!

23:53.755 --> 23:54.824
Isaiah 28:11.

23:56.592 --> 23:57.658
For with stammering lips

23:57.660 --> 24:00.927
and another tongue He
will speak to the people.

24:00.929 --> 24:01.896
I'm a genius.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.264
They're all verses about
speaking in tongues.

24:04.266 --> 24:05.265
No shit?

24:05.267 --> 24:08.301
I told you, you fuckwits,
it wasn't a date.

24:08.303 --> 24:10.905
Chapter, verse, book number.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.808
Our guy's an Evangelical
Christian.

24:13.810 --> 24:15.943
Don't look very Evangelical to
me.

24:15.945 --> 24:17.177
Excellent police work,
detective.

24:17.179 --> 24:19.879
You've narrowed our list down
to everybody in the country

24:19.881 --> 24:23.818
who has access to a Bible,
you fucking dickhead.

24:23.820 --> 24:25.355
Who called it in?

24:28.457 --> 24:30.390
Well, isn't this a coincidence?

24:30.392 --> 24:32.993
Yeah, I'm screwed now, aren't I?

24:32.995 --> 24:34.294
How so?

24:34.296 --> 24:35.163
I was talking with my accountant

24:35.165 --> 24:38.398
about selling up and moving to
Cyprus.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.834
No capital gains tax.

24:39.836 --> 24:41.402
Thinking of blowing this
shithole

24:41.404 --> 24:43.404
and have a happy retirement in
the sun.

24:43.406 --> 24:44.271
So what's the problem?

24:44.273 --> 24:45.639
Who the hell is gonna buy

24:45.641 --> 24:48.442
the Ripper's favorite
incompetent security firm?

24:48.444 --> 24:49.609
I'm ruined!

24:49.611 --> 24:51.912
I'm already struggling to
keep hold of those contracts

24:51.914 --> 24:55.383
ever since that Kingley Street
thing was in the papers.

24:55.385 --> 24:58.286
Why did you arrive on site
before we did?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.087
You found the body, yeah?

24:59.089 --> 25:00.488
Yeah.
So why didn't you call us?

25:00.490 --> 25:01.758
He's the boss.

25:02.725 --> 25:03.790
You get around, don't
you?

25:03.792 --> 25:06.359
We do all the security
for Sanderson Lisle sites.

25:06.361 --> 25:07.694
Sanderson Lisle.

25:07.696 --> 25:09.363
They get around a bit too.

25:09.365 --> 25:10.463
How long has he been your boss?

25:10.465 --> 25:11.732
Have you got access to Kingley
Street?

25:11.734 --> 25:12.599
What, no, no.

25:12.601 --> 25:13.733
This is my first day.

25:13.735 --> 25:15.069
I'm from the temp agency.

25:15.071 --> 25:16.503
That's an eventful first
day.

25:16.505 --> 25:17.504
Yeah, and my last.

25:17.506 --> 25:19.339
So you called Mr. Dewire.

25:19.341 --> 25:21.975
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't think.

25:21.977 --> 25:23.511
I rushed straight over here.

25:23.513 --> 25:26.480
I called 999 as soon as I saw
the body.

25:26.482 --> 25:30.017
Did you touch it?
Of course I didn't!

25:30.019 --> 25:31.021
We'll see.

25:36.693 --> 25:39.029
Mr. Sweet is expecting you.

25:43.465 --> 25:46.466
What a pleasure it is
to see you both again.

25:46.468 --> 25:48.536
I just wish it was a more
salubrious circumstances.

25:48.538 --> 25:49.406
Please.

25:51.773 --> 25:54.841
So who's playing the good cop
and who's playing the bad cop?

25:54.843 --> 25:55.943
Just a routine inquiry.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.611
Yes, it seems to be becoming
a routine, doesn't it?

25:58.613 --> 26:00.981
Two bodies on two of
your sites in two days.

26:00.983 --> 26:02.515
That is quite a coincidence.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.585
Coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous.

26:04.587 --> 26:05.953
What are you saying?

26:05.955 --> 26:07.655
Albert Einstein.

26:07.657 --> 26:09.525
Scientist, crazy hair?

26:11.894 --> 26:14.060
We've looked through
your Kingley Street logs.

26:14.062 --> 26:16.563
So nobody from this company
has visited the site

26:16.565 --> 26:17.831
since you bought it?

26:17.833 --> 26:19.032
Don't you think that's strange?

26:19.034 --> 26:21.735
What I think is strange is
why such a beautiful creature

26:21.737 --> 26:25.475
would choose to surround
herself with death?

26:29.378 --> 26:30.377
Do know know how many derelict
sites

26:30.379 --> 26:32.146
like Kingley Street I own?

26:32.148 --> 26:33.146
Enlighten us.

26:33.148 --> 26:34.882
Far too many to tell you
off the top of my head.

26:36.519 --> 26:37.385
Kingley Street hardly seems

26:37.387 --> 26:39.587
like a gold standard investment
to me.

26:39.589 --> 26:41.521
No, I'm sure it doesn't.

26:41.523 --> 26:43.456
And that's why I'm the
youngest full equity partner

26:43.458 --> 26:46.092
in Sanderson Lisle's long
and distinguished history.

26:46.094 --> 26:48.030
And you're a policeman.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.801
A rebreather?

26:53.503 --> 26:54.734
You dive?

26:54.736 --> 26:55.603
Nothing like this.

26:55.605 --> 26:56.604
I'm assuming this is somewhere
deep.

26:56.606 --> 27:01.408
As deep as it gets: the
Cheve System, Mexico.

27:01.410 --> 27:02.809
You ever swim underground?

27:02.811 --> 27:05.178
No, I'm just a tourist.

27:05.180 --> 27:06.780
Shallow reefs, pretty fish,

27:06.782 --> 27:09.617
and then back in time for
cocktails.

27:09.619 --> 27:12.955
Cave diving, even the idea
freaks me out.

27:16.559 --> 27:20.427
You'll never overcome your
fears until you face them.

27:20.429 --> 27:23.532
Carrying a big gun always helps,
eh?

27:24.699 --> 27:25.398
What are your logs going to give
us

27:25.400 --> 27:26.599
regarding the Jefferson site?

27:26.601 --> 27:28.903
Many hours of overtime, it's
an active construction site.

27:28.905 --> 27:31.871
We will have numerous employees
visiting on a regular basis.

27:31.873 --> 27:32.740
And you?

27:32.742 --> 27:33.607
My numerous employees mean

27:33.609 --> 27:34.541
I don't have to visit building
sites.

27:34.543 --> 27:37.043
So you personally have never
been there?

27:37.045 --> 27:38.611
No, no time.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.750
Too many caves to explore.

27:52.028 --> 27:53.461
How are you doing?

27:53.463 --> 27:55.195
I'm fine, thanks.

27:55.197 --> 27:56.696
How are you?

27:56.698 --> 27:58.901
I'm very well, thank you.

28:08.176 --> 28:10.243
Is there anything you
would like to talk about?

28:10.245 --> 28:14.581
Yes, I would just like to
get this prescription renewed

28:14.583 --> 28:16.483
so I can get back to work.

28:16.485 --> 28:18.751
That's not strictly what I'm
here for.

28:18.753 --> 28:19.886
You'll have to see your own
doctor

28:19.888 --> 28:21.989
for personal prescriptions.

28:21.991 --> 28:22.923
Yeah, of course.

28:22.925 --> 28:23.957
If I could get any time off,

28:23.959 --> 28:28.561
which isn't really
happening right now, is it?

28:28.563 --> 28:29.829
And how is work?

28:29.831 --> 28:31.030
Fine.

28:31.032 --> 28:32.966
Busy, obviously.

28:32.968 --> 28:34.501
Serious crime squad.

28:34.503 --> 28:36.236
That's quite a step up.

28:36.238 --> 28:38.908
Your father must be very proud.

28:40.243 --> 28:41.778
I'm sure he is.

28:42.844 --> 28:43.712
Tell me.

28:44.613 --> 28:46.680
Oh for God's sake.

28:46.682 --> 28:47.551
Really?

28:48.618 --> 28:51.085
Tell me about your
relationship with your father.

28:51.087 --> 28:53.721
Jesus Christ, shall we move on?

28:53.723 --> 28:55.090
Maybe next time.

28:56.859 --> 28:58.291
Have you experienced any
more extreme reactions

28:58.293 --> 28:59.626
at crime scenes?

28:59.628 --> 29:01.529
Oh my god, I told you.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.931
I've been getting over
this stomach flu, okay?

29:03.933 --> 29:05.936
So, I'm absolutely fine.

29:07.302 --> 29:09.936
You seem agitated.
Yeah, I am agitated

29:09.938 --> 29:11.271
because I have a job to do.

29:11.273 --> 29:13.273
So I just want to get
this prescription renewed

29:13.275 --> 29:15.776
so I can get back to it.

29:15.778 --> 29:18.782
We both have a job to do,
Rebecca.

29:25.588 --> 29:30.057
Mine is to make sure you
are healthy and happy.

30:11.199 --> 30:14.300
Victim one worked in San
Juan Bautista Tuxtepec.

30:14.302 --> 30:15.101
What are you jabbering about?

30:15.103 --> 30:17.671
That's only 80 miles from
Cheves.

30:17.673 --> 30:19.173
Like he said: what are
you jabbering about?

30:19.175 --> 30:21.912
We can connect him with Sweet.

30:32.754 --> 30:35.758
You sure you don't require a
lawyer?

30:37.292 --> 30:39.126
I spend my life surrounded
by those parasites.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.665
This makes a pleasant change.

30:43.198 --> 30:45.734
Do you know this gentleman?

30:48.771 --> 30:49.638
No.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.109
How about her?

30:55.144 --> 30:56.012
No.

30:58.179 --> 30:59.181
Him?

31:01.117 --> 31:01.984
No.

31:04.052 --> 31:06.989
Why don't you take a closer
look?

31:12.261 --> 31:13.128
No.

31:15.697 --> 31:17.830
I suppose you're gonna tell me
he works for Sanderson Lisle?

31:17.832 --> 31:18.999
No, he doesn't.

31:19.001 --> 31:20.134
So why would I know him?

31:20.136 --> 31:23.203
Just to clarify, you've never
seen this person before?

31:23.205 --> 31:25.004
Not that I recall.

31:25.006 --> 31:26.440
You were visiting in Oaxaca

31:26.442 --> 31:29.245
between the 2nd and 28th of
July?

31:31.179 --> 31:32.346
It's possible.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.547
I was in Mexico around those
dates.

31:33.549 --> 31:34.615
You'll have to check with my
assistant for confirmation.

31:34.617 --> 31:37.684
No need, we have your
flight records right here.

31:37.686 --> 31:40.721
No private jet I see?

31:40.723 --> 31:43.890
I occasionally slum it in first
class.

31:43.892 --> 31:46.793
This gentleman was also in
Oaxaca at the same time.

31:46.795 --> 31:47.662
Good for him.

31:47.664 --> 31:49.262
It's a delightful part of the
world.

31:49.264 --> 31:51.799
He worked as a doctor
at the Tuxtepec General.

31:51.801 --> 31:54.033
A most noble profession.

31:54.035 --> 31:56.235
Do you seek any medical
treatment during your visit?

31:56.237 --> 31:58.871
I didn't, I'm a picture of
health.

31:58.873 --> 32:03.012
Unfortunately, we cannot say
the same for our friend here.

32:05.013 --> 32:08.685
Or him.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.876
What are these?

32:35.077 --> 32:36.746
What do you mean?

32:37.513 --> 32:39.146
The numbers.

32:39.148 --> 32:41.150
Why don't you tell us?

32:46.755 --> 32:47.754
So is that plunging neckline

32:47.756 --> 32:51.393
designed to beguile a
confession out of me?

32:59.334 --> 33:01.969
We have three murders.

33:01.971 --> 33:04.937
Two bodies were discovered on
your site.

33:04.939 --> 33:08.242
The third victim was in the
same remote region as you were

33:08.244 --> 33:11.244
two weeks before he came back
to London and was killed.

33:11.246 --> 33:13.146
I take it you're suggesting
I am connected in some way?

33:13.148 --> 33:14.181
Are you?

33:14.183 --> 33:15.782
Of course not.

33:15.784 --> 33:18.018
But the coincidences
are really mounting up.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.386
And that's all they
are.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.921
And you really expect us to
believe that?

33:20.923 --> 33:22.321
I don't care what you believe.

33:22.323 --> 33:25.893
Your beliefs don't affect
reality.

33:25.895 --> 33:30.032
And the reality is I have
nothing to do with any of this.

33:34.069 --> 33:36.302
There's no way that this is a
coincidence.

33:36.304 --> 33:38.172
The man isn't right, inspector.

33:38.174 --> 33:39.272
I can see him playing dress up

33:39.274 --> 33:41.809
with his mother's rotting
corpse.

33:41.811 --> 33:46.445
Let's liaise with the local
police in Tuxte, Mexico.

33:46.447 --> 33:49.049
See if they can show Sweet's
picture

33:49.051 --> 33:52.019
around the medical center
where the doctor worked.

33:52.021 --> 33:53.953
Can anyone speak Spanish?

33:53.955 --> 33:55.321
I can try.

33:55.323 --> 33:56.993
Me have no Espanol.

33:58.927 --> 34:00.894
Hey, you're gonna love this.

34:00.896 --> 34:01.994
Can't we fit any more in?

34:01.996 --> 34:03.363
Special Branch have kindly
agreed

34:03.365 --> 34:05.365
to give us some extra manpower.

34:05.367 --> 34:08.201
This is Detective Constable?
Rice, hi.

34:08.203 --> 34:10.469
And we are all going to give
each other

34:10.471 --> 34:12.973
our full cooperation.

34:12.975 --> 34:15.442
Detective, this is my team.

34:15.444 --> 34:18.478
DC Lawrence and DS Perkins and...

34:18.480 --> 34:20.047
We've met.
Hello, Eli.

34:20.049 --> 34:21.480
I'm Detective Faraway.

34:21.482 --> 34:22.148
Faraway?

34:22.150 --> 34:22.949
As in Commissioner Faraway?

34:22.951 --> 34:24.951
How do you think she got the
job?

34:24.953 --> 34:26.920
The same way I got him.

34:26.922 --> 34:28.454
Police work, let's do some.

34:28.456 --> 34:30.523
I couldn't agree more.

34:30.525 --> 34:32.159
This is our person of interest

34:32.161 --> 34:36.295
but everything is circumstantial
so far.

34:36.297 --> 34:38.532
Let's turn up the gas.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.567
Perkins, get Rice a copy the
case file,

34:41.569 --> 34:45.172
then go back to all known
associates of the victims

34:45.174 --> 34:47.907
and see if you can pin them to
Sweet.

34:47.909 --> 34:51.011
Anything that might
link him to the victim.

34:51.013 --> 34:52.012
On it.

34:52.014 --> 34:56.315
Eli, set up a 24-hour
surveillance on Sweet.

34:56.317 --> 34:59.319
He doesn't take a piss
without you timing it

34:59.321 --> 35:01.621
and telling me what color it
was.

35:01.623 --> 35:03.456
I love this job so much.

35:03.458 --> 35:04.590
Can you help out with the
hardware?

35:04.592 --> 35:07.226
That's what I'm here for.

35:07.228 --> 35:08.895
What about me?

35:08.897 --> 35:10.963
You go home and rest.

35:10.965 --> 35:13.433
Well done, detective.

35:13.435 --> 35:14.837
You deserve it.

37:51.427 --> 37:53.326
Good morning to you, too.

37:53.328 --> 37:54.561
Is it still morning?

37:54.563 --> 37:55.262
I've been waiting out here so
long,

37:55.264 --> 37:57.463
I'm surprised it's not lunch.

37:57.465 --> 37:59.065
Never gets old.

37:59.067 --> 38:00.002
Just drive.

38:57.391 --> 39:00.559
I hope the other guy came off
worse.

39:00.561 --> 39:03.098
I've got a sinus condition.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.567
Not usually as bad as this.

39:07.569 --> 39:11.204
But, again, I rarely enjoy
such an exciting evening.

39:11.206 --> 39:12.239
What happened?

39:12.241 --> 39:14.407
Absolutely nothing.

39:14.409 --> 39:15.909
He arrived at his apartment
shortly after nine,

39:15.911 --> 39:16.976
hasn't been out since.

39:16.978 --> 39:19.145
You managed to get all
this gear up in one night?

39:19.147 --> 39:20.279
I'm impressed.

39:20.281 --> 39:21.514
I try.

39:21.516 --> 39:25.384
No, we're piggybacking onto
the building's security system.

39:25.386 --> 39:27.721
We have front entrance.

39:27.723 --> 39:29.788
Rear, that's where his car is
parked.

39:29.790 --> 39:31.291
We've got a car at the back?

39:31.293 --> 39:32.192
Of course.

39:32.194 --> 39:32.992
All bases covered.

39:32.994 --> 39:35.831
I hope so 'cause we have
movement.

39:37.799 --> 39:38.665
Where are you going?

39:38.667 --> 39:40.233
We're following him.

39:40.235 --> 39:41.634
We can't follow him, he knows
us.

39:41.636 --> 39:42.735
Better make sure he doesn't see
us, then.

39:54.516 --> 39:56.416
Perkins, heads up, he's on his
way.

39:56.418 --> 39:57.384
What car?

39:57.386 --> 40:00.188
You'll know it when you see it.

40:05.927 --> 40:08.228
Guys, you on him?

40:08.230 --> 40:09.163
Like a rash.

40:09.165 --> 40:10.963
We just turned east onto the
embankment.

40:10.965 --> 40:13.632
We're following you, stay on the
air.

40:13.634 --> 40:16.235
Don't get too close.
Obviously.

40:16.237 --> 40:17.270
We can't let him see us.

40:17.272 --> 40:18.672
I have done this before.

40:18.674 --> 40:21.775
Guys, he's
heading for Kingley Street.

40:21.777 --> 40:22.742
Are you sure?

40:22.744 --> 40:24.578
He just
took a left on Stanway.

40:24.580 --> 40:26.679
We'll take the loop.

40:26.681 --> 40:28.315
Roger that.

40:28.317 --> 40:30.983
Can't you go any faster?

40:42.697 --> 40:43.831
Where are you?

40:43.833 --> 40:45.799
We're two minutes
closer to Kingley Street

40:45.801 --> 40:48.804
than when you asked two minutes
ago.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.875
What, you think I need it?

40:56.877 --> 40:57.576
Maybe.

40:57.578 --> 40:59.878
Might be good for the nerves.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.547
Come on, it's good to share.

41:01.549 --> 41:02.983
You never shared before.

41:02.985 --> 41:04.884
It's a peace offering.

41:04.886 --> 41:05.851
I would have gotten you flowers,

41:05.853 --> 41:09.989
but I didn't want to
give you the wrong idea.

41:09.991 --> 41:10.859
Thanks.

41:21.802 --> 41:23.270
400 yards.

41:35.683 --> 41:36.583
Perfect.

41:36.585 --> 41:37.683
You can hang back, Perkins.

41:37.685 --> 41:38.888
We can see him.

41:49.764 --> 41:51.433
What are you up to?

42:01.743 --> 42:03.543
The hell is that?

42:03.545 --> 42:05.011
Perkins, can you see this?

42:05.013 --> 42:06.079
I can't see shit.

42:06.081 --> 42:06.945
What's happening?

42:06.947 --> 42:08.750
Good work, partner.

42:10.951 --> 42:13.686
Smith, Perkins, where
are you?

42:13.688 --> 42:15.322
Kingley Street, inspector.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.655
We followed Sweet right here.

42:16.657 --> 42:19.925
Get down to
Brookfield Park right away.

42:19.927 --> 42:21.628
Not now, inspector,
we're about to get him.

42:21.630 --> 42:22.996
No, detective, you
are not.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.764
Get down here now.

42:24.766 --> 42:25.632
You don't understand.

42:25.634 --> 42:26.498
We have Sweet.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.067
He's up to something.

42:28.069 --> 42:30.936
Detective, just get
down here.

42:30.938 --> 42:32.274
On the double.

42:37.112 --> 42:38.411
He's getting cocky.

42:38.413 --> 42:39.712
What do you mean?

42:39.714 --> 42:41.413
Out in the open like this.

42:41.415 --> 42:45.553
I would say that, oh, he's
taken a kidney this time.

42:46.487 --> 42:48.487
You certain Sweet didn't leave
his flat?

42:48.489 --> 42:49.188
100%.

42:49.190 --> 42:50.456
I wanna go through the tapes.

42:50.458 --> 42:51.791
I'm not blind, I know what I
saw.

42:51.793 --> 42:53.559
Or didn't see.

42:53.561 --> 42:55.962
Look, darling, I know how to do
my job.

42:55.964 --> 42:57.130
This took place?

42:57.132 --> 42:59.898
Last night, within the last
six hours without a doubt.

42:59.900 --> 43:02.034
It's not possible for Sweet to
be our man.

43:02.036 --> 43:04.003
Serial killers worked in pairs
before.

43:04.005 --> 43:06.105
It's possible, but it's rare.

43:06.107 --> 43:08.141
These guys are pretty
much always lone wolves.

43:08.143 --> 43:09.375
Many things are possible

43:09.377 --> 43:13.512
but I'm not gonna waste tax
payers' money on possibilities.

43:13.514 --> 43:16.148
We're taking the 24-hour
surveillance off Sweet.

43:16.150 --> 43:16.949
You can't do that!

43:16.951 --> 43:18.751
He was obviously up to
something.

43:18.753 --> 43:20.520
Why was he at Kingley street?

43:20.522 --> 43:21.590
He owns it.

43:22.590 --> 43:24.056
We have a murder victim here.

43:24.058 --> 43:26.393
You have a man taking
a bag out of his car.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.994
And his links to all the other
victims?

43:27.996 --> 43:29.799
All circumstantial.

43:30.965 --> 43:33.065
Look, we know who the the victim
is.

43:33.067 --> 43:35.534
We know where he worked and
lived.

43:35.536 --> 43:36.770
Work associates.

43:36.772 --> 43:37.603
Done.

43:37.605 --> 43:39.572
Rice, family and other
associates.

43:39.574 --> 43:42.175
Try to establish a link
with the other victims.

43:42.177 --> 43:43.742
Not really what
Special Branch is trained for,

43:43.744 --> 43:45.612
but sure.
What is that?

43:45.614 --> 43:46.313
A print?

43:46.315 --> 43:48.447
A rare moment of carelessness.

43:48.449 --> 43:49.782
We know where he bought this.

43:49.784 --> 43:53.052
Look underneath, he forgot
to take off the label.

43:55.456 --> 43:57.123
You two, check it out.

43:57.125 --> 43:58.824
This is the best lead we've had.

43:58.826 --> 44:01.161
Track down the retailer,
speak to the owner,

44:01.163 --> 44:03.462
check transactions, CCTV.

44:09.136 --> 44:11.103
What the fuck was that?

44:11.105 --> 44:13.005
What is it?

44:13.007 --> 44:14.940
I thought I saw...
What?

44:14.942 --> 44:16.745
What's wrong Rebecca?

44:17.712 --> 44:19.846
A rat, I thought I saw a rat.

44:19.848 --> 44:20.947
A rat?

44:20.949 --> 44:22.581
Jesus!

44:22.583 --> 44:24.483
I don't like rats, okay, I'm
sorry.

44:24.485 --> 44:25.286
Evidently.

44:26.654 --> 44:28.054
Now you've got your puking under
control,

44:28.056 --> 44:31.694
maybe you wanna work
on those nerves, yeah?

45:50.906 --> 45:52.605
What are you doing?

45:52.607 --> 45:55.141
I'm trying to sell your
house, Miss Faraway.

45:55.143 --> 45:59.482
But I have a feeling Mr.
Wilkinson won't be buying it.

46:00.848 --> 46:04.185
You really need to get your
wiring fixed.

49:12.373 --> 49:14.507
You look awful.

49:14.509 --> 49:16.074
I didn't sleep very well.

49:16.076 --> 49:17.509
What's your excuse?

49:26.321 --> 49:27.219
Hello?

49:27.221 --> 49:28.920
Hello, can we speak to the
proprietor?

49:28.922 --> 49:29.788
No.
No?

49:29.790 --> 49:30.857
What do you mean, no?

49:30.859 --> 49:32.291
See
our terms and conditions.

49:32.293 --> 49:35.293
We are strictly mail order, no
exceptions.

49:35.295 --> 49:37.096
We never entertain customers in
person.

49:37.098 --> 49:39.331
If you've got a complaint,
send us an email.

49:39.333 --> 49:41.833
We're not customers, we're the
police.

49:41.835 --> 49:44.237
Police?

49:44.239 --> 49:45.137
Do you have a warrant?

49:45.139 --> 49:47.373
We just want to ask you some
questions.

49:47.375 --> 49:48.875
Look, man,
I've already been through this

49:48.877 --> 49:50.043
with Trading Standards.

49:50.045 --> 49:52.478
It says quite clearly on my
website in several places

49:52.480 --> 49:54.880
that results are not guaranteed.

49:54.882 --> 49:57.449
This is a perfectly legitimate
business.

49:57.451 --> 49:59.251
We're not here to
investigate your business.

49:59.253 --> 50:02.454
We're investigating a murder.

50:05.493 --> 50:06.360
Murder?

50:12.299 --> 50:14.800
This is not what I expected
a Voodoo shop to look like.

50:14.802 --> 50:16.302
Hey, what did you expect?

50:16.304 --> 50:18.837
A basement lair with shrunken
heads

50:18.839 --> 50:20.940
and strings of garlic
hanging from the ceiling?

50:20.942 --> 50:23.342
Burning incense?

50:23.344 --> 50:25.781
Creepy dolls in glass cases?

50:27.248 --> 50:28.317
Well, yeah.

50:30.051 --> 50:32.951
Here, how about that, hmm?

50:32.953 --> 50:35.823
What can you tell us about this?

50:37.859 --> 50:40.826
It's a talisman candle.

50:40.828 --> 50:43.929
It's a powerful ritualistic aid

50:43.931 --> 50:47.099
used to channel the
practitioner's energies.

50:47.101 --> 50:49.034
They come in a variety of
colors.

50:49.036 --> 50:52.840
Each color has its own
vibrations and powers.

50:54.542 --> 50:56.442
So what powers and
vibrations

50:56.444 --> 50:57.944
does this color have?

50:57.946 --> 51:01.012
Ah, you know, I don't remember.

51:01.014 --> 51:02.114
I'll have to check the website.

51:02.116 --> 51:05.183
Do you know Michael Sweet?

51:05.185 --> 51:06.053
No.

51:07.020 --> 51:08.119
Do you have a customer database?

51:08.121 --> 51:09.221
Do you have a warrant?

51:09.223 --> 51:11.523
Not yet, but considering
the fact that your products

51:11.525 --> 51:14.226
have been found at the
scene of a brutal murder,

51:14.228 --> 51:15.594
it's not going to be difficult
to get one.

51:15.596 --> 51:18.965
Or to hold you in a cell for 24
hours.

51:18.967 --> 51:21.837
Okay, I'll print you out a copy.

51:24.906 --> 51:28.139
Who knew this Voodoo crap was so
popular?

51:28.141 --> 51:30.009
Sweet's not on here.

51:30.011 --> 51:30.976
Forget about Sweet.

51:30.978 --> 51:32.878
You're becoming obsessed.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.547
You can buy stuff online
anonymously, right?

51:34.549 --> 51:36.882
We have 300 new leads right here

51:36.884 --> 51:38.416
and Sweet has half the Met as an
alibi.

51:38.418 --> 51:40.319
Forget about it.

51:40.321 --> 51:42.020
Even if he's not buying
directly,

51:42.022 --> 51:45.090
any one these names could
be his collaborator.

51:45.092 --> 51:46.192
Collaborators!

51:46.194 --> 51:48.594
We could have entire satanic
cult on our hands here.

51:48.596 --> 51:50.096
Either way, Sweet is involved, I
know it.

51:50.098 --> 51:51.898
Look, go home.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.065
Remember how awful you
looked this morning?

51:54.067 --> 51:56.001
Well, that was 12 hours ago.

51:56.003 --> 51:57.270
We can go through the
list in detail tomorrow.

51:57.272 --> 51:58.436
Yeah, okay, I'm just gonna...

51:58.438 --> 52:01.442
You need to relax.
I am relaxed.

52:02.543 --> 52:04.409
Let's get a drink.
What?

52:04.411 --> 52:05.478
You know, a drink.

52:05.480 --> 52:07.980
It's what people do after
a long day on the job.

52:07.982 --> 52:09.051
Unwind a bit.

52:10.418 --> 52:11.453
No, thanks.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.087
You're right, I'm tired.

52:15.089 --> 52:17.355
I'm gonna go home, it's been a
long day.

52:17.357 --> 52:19.026
Good, well, okay.

52:19.993 --> 52:21.594
Make sure you go straight home.

52:21.596 --> 52:22.464
I will.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.429
Promise?

52:24.431 --> 52:25.299
Promise.

52:38.045 --> 52:39.145
The
fuck is wrong with you?

52:39.147 --> 52:41.016
Back off, you bastard!

53:40.308 --> 53:41.373
Hey, girl.

53:41.375 --> 53:42.643
Buy you a drink?

53:44.011 --> 53:45.080
Get off me!

54:43.103 --> 54:43.768
Whoa!

54:43.770 --> 54:45.172
Are you a star?

54:46.741 --> 54:48.009
Are you okay?

54:51.645 --> 54:53.279
Are you okay?

54:53.281 --> 54:54.148
Hm?

54:56.350 --> 54:58.284
I said, are you okay?

54:58.286 --> 54:59.621
Yeah, I'm fine.

55:02.857 --> 55:04.590
Tell us about M and R Trading.

55:04.592 --> 55:05.291
Who?

55:05.293 --> 55:06.491
It stands for Magic and Ritual.

55:06.493 --> 55:09.360
They sell occult supplies.

55:09.362 --> 55:11.197
They aren't a client of mine.

55:11.199 --> 55:12.665
Yeah, we know that.

55:12.667 --> 55:15.101
But you're a customer of theirs?

55:15.103 --> 55:16.434
Am I?

55:16.436 --> 55:17.369
What is this?

55:17.371 --> 55:18.570
I've never heard of them.

55:18.572 --> 55:19.804
So tell me why your
credit card was charged

55:19.806 --> 55:21.607
76 pounds by them last October

55:21.609 --> 55:23.509
for a delivery to this address.

55:23.511 --> 55:24.375
What?

55:24.377 --> 55:26.112
It can't have been.

55:26.114 --> 55:27.182
I don't know.

55:29.449 --> 55:30.315
What is this?

55:30.317 --> 55:31.516
Do I need to get a lawyer?

55:31.518 --> 55:33.853
Items from this shop were
found at all the crime scenes.

55:33.855 --> 55:34.887
You were a customer.

55:34.889 --> 55:37.426
We just need to rule you out.

55:41.596 --> 55:42.661
Halloween.

55:42.663 --> 55:43.829
What?

55:43.831 --> 55:45.831
Halloween, we had a Halloween
party,

55:45.833 --> 55:49.601
and I bought some party
toys from their site.

55:49.603 --> 55:51.871
What did you buy?

55:51.873 --> 55:56.211
Masks, creepy costume capes,
you know, Halloween stuff.

55:57.612 --> 55:58.844
Candles?
Candles?

55:58.846 --> 56:00.579
No, not candles.

56:00.581 --> 56:02.451
Look, I have pictures.

56:07.822 --> 56:09.855
That was a great night.

56:09.857 --> 56:11.525
Three-day hangover.

57:02.777 --> 57:03.909
What type of hallucinations?

57:03.911 --> 57:08.713
Like seeing-things-that-aren't-real
hallucinations.

57:08.715 --> 57:10.248
What type of things?

57:10.250 --> 57:14.188
Like the face of someone
we're investigating.

57:14.956 --> 57:16.721
Your serial killer?
Yeah.

57:16.723 --> 57:20.391
And things in the corner of my
eye.

57:20.393 --> 57:22.263
When did this start?

57:23.331 --> 57:24.630
A few days ago.

57:24.632 --> 57:26.965
Since we renewed your
prescription?

57:26.967 --> 57:28.170
I don't...

57:30.571 --> 57:32.371
Actually, yeah.

57:32.373 --> 57:33.838
Have you been drinking?

57:33.840 --> 57:35.741
Some, but this has never
happened before.

57:35.743 --> 57:38.643
Rebecca, you know you should
never touch medication

57:38.645 --> 57:39.712
with alcohol.

57:39.714 --> 57:40.878
Yeah, but like I said, this
hasn't...

57:40.880 --> 57:41.913
Have you been under any stress

57:41.915 --> 57:43.449
in your personal life recently?

57:43.451 --> 57:44.817
You know I have.

57:44.819 --> 57:46.518
And how is work going?

57:46.520 --> 57:49.621
I hear you're all under a lot of
pressure.

57:49.623 --> 57:51.493
The usual, homicide.

57:52.592 --> 57:55.527
Is this your
first serial killer case?

57:55.529 --> 57:56.398
It is.

57:57.797 --> 58:00.935
I hear it's terribly gruesome
stuff.

58:04.871 --> 58:08.507
And you're partnered with
Detective Sergeant Smith.

58:08.509 --> 58:09.708
I am.

58:09.710 --> 58:10.909
How's that going?

58:10.911 --> 58:13.645
He can be quite prickly
sometimes.

58:13.647 --> 58:15.716
Nothing I can't handle.

58:17.685 --> 58:19.717
Look, Rebecca,

58:19.719 --> 58:23.322
this is clearly an incredibly
stressful time in your life.

58:23.324 --> 58:25.391
Couple that with drinking
a little too much alcohol

58:25.393 --> 58:29.728
whilst taking this very powerful
anti-anxiety medication,

58:29.730 --> 58:33.868
it's little wonder things
are feeling out of control.

58:34.902 --> 58:36.634
Here's what we're going to do.

58:36.636 --> 58:39.605
We are going to try you
off on a new prescription

58:39.607 --> 58:42.875
and you are going to cut out the
alcohol.

58:42.877 --> 58:43.976
Completely.

58:43.978 --> 58:45.513
Not at all, okay?

58:47.748 --> 58:49.081
Don't worry.

58:49.083 --> 58:51.720
Everything is going to be fine.

01:04:29.723 --> 01:04:30.788
What?

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:31.422
Where are you?

01:04:31.424 --> 01:04:32.290
Get down here now.

01:04:32.292 --> 01:04:33.761
He's confessing.

01:04:36.429 --> 01:04:37.996
He just came in.

01:04:37.998 --> 01:04:40.866
Confessed to the killings
and then clammed up.

01:04:40.868 --> 01:04:42.768
Says he will only speak to you.

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:43.838
To me, why?

01:04:44.737 --> 01:04:46.873
He wasn't very coherent.

01:04:50.243 --> 01:04:51.842
So, she's arrived.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:52.980
Start talking.

01:04:56.049 --> 01:04:57.449
Hello, Mr. Dewire.

01:04:57.451 --> 01:04:59.083
I hear you would like to talk to
me.

01:04:59.085 --> 01:05:00.152
I did it.

01:05:00.154 --> 01:05:01.319
You did what?

01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:03.154
I killed them.

01:05:03.156 --> 01:05:04.121
Who did you kill?

01:05:04.123 --> 01:05:05.792
Everybody.

01:05:06.726 --> 01:05:09.293
Could you be a little more
specific?

01:05:09.295 --> 01:05:11.096
Kingley street.

01:05:11.098 --> 01:05:12.297
Brookfield.

01:05:12.299 --> 01:05:13.764
The jogger, the doctor.

01:05:13.766 --> 01:05:15.833
I killed them all, I did it!

01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:17.969
Why did you kill them?

01:05:17.971 --> 01:05:19.871
I can't remember.

01:05:19.873 --> 01:05:20.739
So you remember killing them

01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:22.741
but you don't remember why you
did it?

01:05:22.743 --> 01:05:24.141
No.

01:05:24.143 --> 01:05:25.145
Yes, I must,

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.447
I must just be evil.

01:05:28.449 --> 01:05:31.083
How did you choose your victims?

01:05:31.085 --> 01:05:32.753
I can't remember.

01:05:34.154 --> 01:05:36.721
Did you know your victims
before you killed them?

01:05:36.723 --> 01:05:38.125
Did I Know them?

01:05:39.927 --> 01:05:41.893
I don't think so.

01:05:41.895 --> 01:05:44.395
Which victim did you kill first?

01:05:44.397 --> 01:05:45.797
I don't know.

01:05:45.799 --> 01:05:47.299
What does it matter, they're all
dead now.

01:05:47.301 --> 01:05:49.233
We need to establish the
details.

01:05:49.235 --> 01:05:52.170
We need to establish
that you actually did it.

01:05:52.172 --> 01:05:53.971
Why have you chosen now to
confess?

01:05:53.973 --> 01:05:55.873
Because it's the right thing to
do.

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:58.242
What's with all the demonic
stuff?

01:05:58.244 --> 01:05:59.112
Satan.

01:06:00.013 --> 01:06:01.880
Satan must have driven me to it.

01:06:01.882 --> 01:06:04.282
Why have you been removing body
parts?

01:06:04.284 --> 01:06:05.353
Body parts?

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:07.755
I must be sick!

01:06:08.855 --> 01:06:11.255
Okay, take a breath.

01:06:11.257 --> 01:06:13.125
Okay, relax.

01:06:13.127 --> 01:06:14.291
Would you like a coffee?

01:06:14.293 --> 01:06:17.295
Coffee, no, I don't want a
fucking coffee!

01:06:17.297 --> 01:06:21.299
I just wanna get rid
of this terrible guilt!

01:06:21.301 --> 01:06:23.501
Have you killed anybody else

01:06:23.503 --> 01:06:26.103
aside from the people
in the papers, I mean?

01:06:26.105 --> 01:06:27.941
Oh god, yes, I have.

01:06:30.043 --> 01:06:31.909
Lots of people.

01:06:31.911 --> 01:06:33.180
All those faces.

01:06:34.047 --> 01:06:35.782
This is a nightmare.

01:06:36.449 --> 01:06:38.416
This is a nightmare.

01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:43.255
You don't
actually believe him, do you?

01:06:43.257 --> 01:06:44.221
What do you mean?

01:06:44.223 --> 01:06:45.157
Look at him.

01:06:45.159 --> 01:06:46.023
He's insane.

01:06:46.025 --> 01:06:46.891
Of course he is.

01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:47.558
He's a serial killer.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.994
I don't buy it.

01:06:48.996 --> 01:06:50.362
Why would he suddenly confess
now?

01:06:50.364 --> 01:06:51.563
Because he's insane.

01:06:51.565 --> 01:06:53.364
Why did he only want to talk to
you?

01:06:53.366 --> 01:06:54.800
Because he's insane!

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:57.101
Why has he been removing
organs from victims?

01:06:57.103 --> 01:06:58.904
Because he's insane!

01:06:58.906 --> 01:07:00.838
Look, every question
you ask can be answered

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.007
because he's batshit crazy!

01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:05.210
How many fake confessions have
we had on this case so far?

01:07:05.212 --> 01:07:07.913
As many as you'd expect
on a case like this.

01:07:07.915 --> 01:07:09.380
Oh come on, he's given us
specifics.

01:07:09.382 --> 01:07:10.248
What specifics?

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:11.382
He's given us nothing!

01:07:11.384 --> 01:07:13.184
Look, this guy isn't some random
nutter.

01:07:13.186 --> 01:07:14.953
This guy is connected, he's on
the list.

01:07:14.955 --> 01:07:16.855
We were at his office just
yesterday!

01:07:16.857 --> 01:07:17.688
Yeah, we were.

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:18.724
Maybe we pushed him over the
edge.

01:07:18.726 --> 01:07:20.425
You're damn right we
pushed him over the edge.

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:21.826
That's police work.

01:07:21.828 --> 01:07:23.261
You want him to be guilty!

01:07:23.263 --> 01:07:25.163
What, the guy who just
confessed?

01:07:25.165 --> 01:07:26.898
The guy we've got in custody
now?

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.465
The guy who is linked in
numerous ways

01:07:28.467 --> 01:07:30.902
to a series of vicious bloody
murders?

01:07:30.904 --> 01:07:33.070
Yeah, I want the scumbag to be
guilty.

01:07:33.072 --> 01:07:36.041
Means we finally got the
psycho off the streets!

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.378
Fuck!

01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:49.157
Ambulance, now!

01:07:53.393 --> 01:07:55.159
We need to compress, get me a
cloth!

01:07:55.161 --> 01:07:56.393
Would I have a cloth?

01:07:56.395 --> 01:07:57.962
Take off your shirt!

01:07:57.964 --> 01:08:00.100
You take off your shirt!

01:08:01.868 --> 01:08:03.134
Hurry up!

01:08:03.136 --> 01:08:04.806
It's a new shirt.

01:08:11.177 --> 01:08:12.244
It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:08:12.246 --> 01:08:14.411
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:14.413 --> 01:08:16.113
I'm sorry.

01:08:16.115 --> 01:08:19.917
But I don't know what's real
anymore.

01:08:45.145 --> 01:08:48.415
007, let you hair down, we won't
tell.

01:08:54.553 --> 01:08:55.685
Come on, get with the program.

01:08:55.688 --> 01:08:57.555
In one...
Thanks but no.

01:08:57.557 --> 01:08:59.491
This is a celebration.

01:08:59.493 --> 01:09:01.225
Excuse me if I don't feel like
celebrating

01:09:01.227 --> 01:09:03.028
the death of another human
being.

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:04.461
Lighten up, Faraway.

01:09:04.462 --> 01:09:05.497
We cracked the case.

01:09:05.499 --> 01:09:07.599
Did we?
Not this again.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.135
The guy's house was
practically a shrine to Satan.

01:09:11.136 --> 01:09:15.040
He confessed, he killed himself,
case closed, end of story.

01:09:15.042 --> 01:09:15.910
Now shoot.

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:24.247
Good job.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:25.185
Your round.

01:09:29.154 --> 01:09:32.189
What can I get you?

01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:38.595
Just the same again.

01:09:38.596 --> 01:09:42.000
The noisy table in the corner.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.613
You're a damn fine
detective, you know that?

01:09:56.615 --> 01:09:58.116
Thanks.
Damn fine.

01:09:58.118 --> 01:09:59.051
I appreciate that.

01:09:59.053 --> 01:09:59.917
Yeah, so you got the wrong guy
this time

01:09:59.919 --> 01:10:02.487
but you followed the trail, you
know?

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:03.220
You linked the pieces.

01:10:03.222 --> 01:10:05.055
That's all you can do.
Yeah.

01:10:05.057 --> 01:10:06.658
And we make a great team.
Do we?

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.759
Great team.

01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:10.996
You are your father's
daughter, that is for sure.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:12.329
He must be very proud.

01:10:12.331 --> 01:10:14.599
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:17.702
I'm glad you didn't get his
looks, though.

01:10:19.138 --> 01:10:20.537
All right, I have to take this.

01:10:20.539 --> 01:10:21.408
Yeah.

01:10:27.213 --> 01:10:29.247
Do you miss me?

01:10:29.249 --> 01:10:30.782
No, I don't.

01:10:30.784 --> 01:10:32.117
What?

01:10:32.119 --> 01:10:35.153
That's because you're a
miserable bitch.

01:10:35.155 --> 01:10:36.691
Just sell the house.

01:10:37.723 --> 01:10:40.324
I can't stand to hear your
voice.

01:10:40.326 --> 01:10:42.260
You're just so fucked up!

01:10:42.262 --> 01:10:44.162
Just fuck off.

01:10:44.164 --> 01:10:46.064
Don't ever wanna see you again.

01:10:46.066 --> 01:10:50.034
You know, you push nice
people, nice people like me,

01:10:50.036 --> 01:10:52.069
push them away from you.

01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:54.007
You're gonna die alone.

01:10:55.142 --> 01:10:56.707
You're a disgrace to the force.

01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:57.576
You look like shit.

01:10:57.578 --> 01:11:00.478
God, you're a fucking
monster.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.113
Rebecca.

01:11:04.383 --> 01:11:07.020
Stay down, you piece of shit!

01:11:57.236 --> 01:12:00.438
Details of the suicide are
still under investigation

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.872
but I can confirm

01:12:01.874 --> 01:12:05.609
that Mr. Dewire was responsible
for the recent killing...

01:12:05.611 --> 01:12:07.778
Now the wasp
drags the paralyzed spider

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.447
back to its nest.

01:12:09.449 --> 01:12:10.280
We have received

01:12:10.282 --> 01:12:13.350
multiple unconfirmed reports
that U...

01:12:13.352 --> 01:12:14.685
R.

01:12:14.687 --> 01:12:15.556
Juan!

01:12:17.656 --> 01:12:19.390
♪ Crazy ♪

01:12:19.392 --> 01:12:20.591
Mixed up.
Bitch.

01:12:20.593 --> 01:12:24.229
The copulation can be violent
and last up to 30 minutes.

01:12:57.731 --> 01:12:58.866
Turn around!

01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:01.933
Look behind you!

01:13:01.935 --> 01:13:04.138
No, you look behind you.

01:13:25.659 --> 01:13:26.527
Go away!

01:13:28.727 --> 01:13:29.596
Go away!

01:13:31.697 --> 01:13:32.900
Leave me alone!

01:14:07.366 --> 01:14:08.366
Who is it?

01:14:08.368 --> 01:14:10.902
It's Detective Faraway.

01:14:10.904 --> 01:14:12.537
Do you
know what time it is?

01:14:12.539 --> 01:14:14.271
Look, please, sorry.

01:14:14.273 --> 01:14:16.873
I really need to speak
to you, it's urgent.

01:14:19.913 --> 01:14:21.645
I hate to say it but, you know,

01:14:21.647 --> 01:14:23.480
sales are through the roof.

01:14:23.482 --> 01:14:27.420
There really is no such
thing as bad publicity.

01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:34.591
You know, I gave the other
officers

01:14:34.593 --> 01:14:35.859
access to all my files...

01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:37.694
So, what do you call yourself?

01:14:37.696 --> 01:14:38.565
Doug.

01:14:41.601 --> 01:14:45.569
No, I mean, are you
witch doctor, a shaman?

01:14:45.571 --> 01:14:47.574
What, are you serious?

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:50.975
I'm a businessman.

01:14:50.977 --> 01:14:52.542
What about all this?

01:14:52.544 --> 01:14:53.911
This crap?

01:14:53.913 --> 01:14:55.279
This is just stuff I sell

01:14:55.281 --> 01:14:57.715
to whomever is gullible enough
to buy it.

01:14:57.717 --> 01:15:00.618
You don't believe in any of it?

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.590
What's this all about?

01:15:04.758 --> 01:15:06.894
I've been seeing things.

01:15:09.062 --> 01:15:11.796
What kind of things?

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:13.734
I don't know, ghosts.

01:15:14.767 --> 01:15:16.904
Right.
Horrible things.

01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:23.944
How often have you been
seeing these horrible things?

01:15:34.553 --> 01:15:35.554
All the time.

01:15:37.757 --> 01:15:41.895
I think I've been cursed
or possessed or something.

01:15:43.996 --> 01:15:44.865
Okay.

01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:48.602
So, I'm sorry.

01:15:50.402 --> 01:15:54.805
I don't think I'm the person
you should be speaking to.

01:15:54.807 --> 01:15:56.506
Maybe I can call your doctor?

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:59.846
No, no doctors, they all think
I'm mad.

01:16:04.116 --> 01:16:05.451
And so do you.

01:16:06.686 --> 01:16:09.586
I don't know what I was
thinking.

01:16:09.588 --> 01:16:11.389
I'll go, I'll go.

01:16:11.391 --> 01:16:12.026
Wait.

01:16:14.093 --> 01:16:15.092
Sit down.

01:16:15.094 --> 01:16:15.963
It's okay.

01:16:24.103 --> 01:16:27.775
How long have you been
seeing these ghosts?

01:16:28.775 --> 01:16:31.712
When I started working this
case.

01:16:33.812 --> 01:16:36.848
Well, the murders, they were
ritualized.

01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:39.053
Satanic symbols everywhere.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.391
I think I've been infected by
something.

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:48.059
Do you think that's possible?

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:51.395
Do I think it's possible
that you could be possessed

01:16:51.397 --> 01:16:53.430
by some kind of satanic entity?

01:16:53.432 --> 01:16:54.899
Yeah.

01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:55.769
No.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.470
I think you may have let your
imagination

01:17:00.472 --> 01:17:02.342
get the better of you.

01:17:03.109 --> 01:17:03.940
I mean, it must be really
stressful

01:17:03.942 --> 01:17:06.411
being confronted with all of
this.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:09.646
Seeing what you do in your work,
I mean.

01:17:09.648 --> 01:17:11.482
You don't believe in demons?

01:17:11.484 --> 01:17:14.085
Demons?
Black magic, the occult.

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:15.952
You don't believe that magic
exists?

01:17:15.954 --> 01:17:18.488
I didn't say that.

01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:21.792
Magic exists in a way, you know?

01:17:21.794 --> 01:17:23.094
Sleight of hand.

01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:24.694
Smoke and mirrors.

01:17:24.696 --> 01:17:26.766
Suggestion, misdirection.

01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:32.438
If you believe it can happen
to you, then maybe it will.

01:17:33.772 --> 01:17:35.473
The placebo effect.

01:17:35.475 --> 01:17:37.574
But I never believed
in any of this before.

01:17:37.576 --> 01:17:39.109
I'm a rationalist, for God's
sakes.

01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:41.848
That's why I became a detective.

01:17:44.217 --> 01:17:45.082
So you think it's possible

01:17:45.084 --> 01:17:47.717
that someone could be making me
believe?

01:17:47.719 --> 01:17:49.987
Isn't that what magicians do?

01:17:49.989 --> 01:17:51.189
So what do I do?

01:17:51.191 --> 01:17:52.393
Ignore it?

01:17:53.459 --> 01:17:54.891
It's not real.

01:17:54.893 --> 01:17:56.627
Just close your eyes.

01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:57.631
Count to 10.

01:17:58.664 --> 01:18:00.801
Just let it wash over you.

01:18:02.235 --> 01:18:05.002
I know it can be hard
to unbelieve something

01:18:05.004 --> 01:18:09.806
but if you stop feeding these
visions, they will go away.

01:18:09.808 --> 01:18:12.676
Unless, of course, you really
are crazy.

01:18:15.514 --> 01:18:17.651
Hey, you see anything now?

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.097
See, it's working already.

01:18:57.022 --> 01:18:58.788
It's not real.

01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:00.593
It's only in my head.

01:19:35.928 --> 01:19:37.196
This isn't real.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.266
Eli Smith, leave a
message.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:25.903
Hello, Eli, it's Rebecca.

01:21:25.905 --> 01:21:28.305
Okay, I know we haven't spoken
since,

01:21:28.307 --> 01:21:29.407
I'm really, really sorry about
all that.

01:21:29.409 --> 01:21:31.942
I was in a really bad place,
okay?

01:21:31.944 --> 01:21:35.445
But I've broken into Sweet's
apartment

01:21:35.447 --> 01:21:37.316
and I was right, okay?

01:21:38.785 --> 01:21:39.449
He's the killer.

01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:40.920
He's a Satanist.

01:21:42.254 --> 01:21:43.287
Get here now.

01:21:43.289 --> 01:21:45.088
Bring everybody.

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:46.692
Becca.

01:21:49.428 --> 01:21:51.030
You're not real.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:03.910
You're awake.

01:22:07.413 --> 01:22:08.281
Dad?

01:22:09.981 --> 01:22:12.882
We've all been so worried.

01:22:12.884 --> 01:22:14.452
Don't move, Rebecca.

01:22:14.454 --> 01:22:15.318
Lie down.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.856
You need to rest.

01:22:17.956 --> 01:22:18.988
What happened?

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.857
Where am I?

01:22:19.859 --> 01:22:20.725
Where's Sweet?

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:21.391
We got him.

01:22:21.393 --> 01:22:22.396
You got him.

01:22:23.329 --> 01:22:24.761
You were about to become his
next victim.

01:22:24.763 --> 01:22:27.100
Smith got there just in time.

01:22:29.502 --> 01:22:31.237
Eli saved my life?

01:22:32.437 --> 01:22:34.404
I'll never live that down.

01:22:34.406 --> 01:22:35.473
Where is he?

01:22:35.475 --> 01:22:37.475
He's in the waiting room.

01:22:37.477 --> 01:22:39.176
I think he's a bit embarrassed

01:22:39.178 --> 01:22:42.315
that he was so wrong about
everything.

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:46.319
Rebecca.

01:22:50.822 --> 01:22:51.691
I'm sorry

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:54.759
Sorry?

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:55.428
What for?

01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.066
For everything.

01:23:14.347 --> 01:23:17.480
I know I haven't always shown it

01:23:17.482 --> 01:23:21.087
but I've always been so very
proud of you.

01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:26.927
I love you.

01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:32.465
I'm sorry.

01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:59.556
Lie down, Becca, you need to
rest.

01:23:59.558 --> 01:24:00.625
Get off me.

01:24:00.627 --> 01:24:03.293
Do what your father tells
you, and lie on the bed.

01:24:03.295 --> 01:24:04.362
This isn't real.

01:24:04.364 --> 01:24:07.264
Don't struggle, you're
only gonna make it worse.

01:24:07.266 --> 01:24:09.199
This is not real!

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.223
My, aren't you a strong one.

01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:36.562
It's always good to have a fall
back.

01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:39.329
I've already called my partner.

01:24:39.331 --> 01:24:40.198
They know everything.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.233
Oh yes, the police department's
finest.

01:24:42.235 --> 01:24:45.435
I'm sure he will be here any
second.

01:24:45.437 --> 01:24:47.403
I think I can hear sirens
in the distance already.

01:24:47.405 --> 01:24:48.973
You're crazy.

01:24:48.975 --> 01:24:51.140
Those in glass houses, Becca.

01:24:51.142 --> 01:24:54.043
You must realize none of this is
real.

01:24:54.045 --> 01:24:56.479
Are you sure about that?

01:24:56.481 --> 01:24:58.114
How do you think I got into that
mixed up

01:24:58.116 --> 01:25:01.217
little head of yours this last
month?

01:25:01.219 --> 01:25:02.552
I feel for you.

01:25:02.554 --> 01:25:04.255
I really do.

01:25:04.257 --> 01:25:05.922
That wasn't a pleasant place to
reside

01:25:05.924 --> 01:25:08.128
even before I got in there.

01:25:10.228 --> 01:25:12.595
I'm in your debt, you know?

01:25:12.597 --> 01:25:16.199
I was all ready to give up
on this little experiment

01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:18.635
until you gave me the key.

01:25:18.637 --> 01:25:20.637
He has been trying to speak to
me.

01:25:20.639 --> 01:25:24.375
I just never waited around
long enough to hear him.

01:25:24.377 --> 01:25:28.077
Instant gratification, I've
always struggled with that one.

01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:29.246
I understand, okay?

01:25:29.248 --> 01:25:30.113
This isn't your fault.

01:25:30.115 --> 01:25:31.681
You aren't fully...

01:25:31.683 --> 01:25:34.087
The numbers on the walls.

01:25:35.288 --> 01:25:38.488
I didn't leave those
messages at the crime scenes.

01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:39.489
In fact, I didn't even know they
existed

01:25:39.491 --> 01:25:42.192
till you very graciously
showed me those photos.

01:25:42.194 --> 01:25:45.362
That wasn't me.

01:25:45.364 --> 01:25:46.299
It was him.

01:25:47.667 --> 01:25:48.998
Please.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.070
Mark 16:17.

01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:54.203
Cast out devils, they shall
speak with new tongues.

01:25:54.205 --> 01:25:56.172
Though I speak with the
tongues of men and angels,

01:25:56.174 --> 01:25:59.409
and I have not charity,
Corinthians 13:1.

01:25:59.411 --> 01:26:01.644
Just let me go, okay, I can get
you help.

01:26:01.646 --> 01:26:04.113
Come on, detective, haven't
you worked it out yet?

01:26:04.115 --> 01:26:07.717
I've been offering up the
wrong body parts all this time.

01:26:07.719 --> 01:26:10.990
He's telling me he needs your
tongue.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.158
My tongue?

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.061
At least I think that's
what he's telling me.

01:26:18.063 --> 01:26:19.595
You're gonna have to bear with
me on this.

01:26:19.597 --> 01:26:21.165
This is all new ground.

01:26:21.167 --> 01:26:24.571
We're traveling into the unknown
together.

01:26:27.106 --> 01:26:28.706
The only difference is

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.640
I'm coming back.

01:26:33.279 --> 01:26:35.445
All right, have it your way.

01:26:35.447 --> 01:26:36.980
No anesthetic.

01:26:36.982 --> 01:26:38.082
I was trying to be nice.

01:27:10.482 --> 01:27:12.485
I offer you this tongue.

01:27:13.619 --> 01:27:14.554
Now, speak.

01:27:22.093 --> 01:27:23.163
Are you here?

01:27:25.697 --> 01:27:26.566
Hello?

01:27:31.437 --> 01:27:32.305
Fuck it!

01:27:40.478 --> 01:27:43.615
I honestly thought I had it that
time.

01:27:45.450 --> 01:27:48.355
Look, sorry about the tongue
thing.

01:27:49.454 --> 01:27:52.389
I feel really terrible now.

01:28:03.334 --> 01:28:04.301
I did it!

01:28:06.438 --> 01:28:07.307
I did it!

01:28:09.475 --> 01:28:10.343
We did it!

01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:13.476
These are my terms.

01:28:13.478 --> 01:28:15.414
Slow down, slow down.

01:28:16.514 --> 01:28:19.315
This isn't how to conduct a
negotiation.

01:28:19.317 --> 01:28:22.187
First we make a little small
talk.

01:28:23.355 --> 01:28:24.421
Build rapport.

01:28:24.423 --> 01:28:25.358
Develop trust.

01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:30.530
Okay, straight to
business, you're the boss.

01:28:32.597 --> 01:28:33.465
Come on.

01:28:34.732 --> 01:28:37.568
You know exactly what I want.

01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:40.203
I want to be like you.

01:28:40.205 --> 01:28:42.171
I want real physical power.

01:28:42.173 --> 01:28:43.239
I'm bored of having nothing

01:28:43.241 --> 01:28:45.442
but these tedious little
mind tricks to work with.

01:28:45.444 --> 01:28:46.646
It's so tiring.

01:28:49.115 --> 01:28:53.253
I want to manipulate hard
objective tangible reality.

01:28:59.525 --> 01:29:00.756
Haven't I given you enough
already?

01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:03.627
What will you take?

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.532
Don't be ridiculous.

01:29:08.534 --> 01:29:09.399
That's never going to happen.

01:29:09.401 --> 01:29:10.434
Try again.

01:29:11.236 --> 01:29:14.270
Step out of the
circle.

01:29:14.272 --> 01:29:15.471
My life?

01:29:15.473 --> 01:29:17.674
That's almost as bad as my soul.

01:29:17.676 --> 01:29:20.476
Why are you treating me like an
imbecile?

01:29:20.478 --> 01:29:21.377
Do you have any idea who I am?

01:29:21.379 --> 01:29:23.279
I'm the youngest full equity
partner...

01:29:25.316 --> 01:29:27.350
Okay, I respect you.

01:29:27.352 --> 01:29:28.187
Calm down.

01:29:35.326 --> 01:29:36.195
A life.

01:29:37.829 --> 01:29:38.697
Her life.

01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:41.497
Will that work for you?

01:29:53.545 --> 01:29:54.744
Well, why didn't you just say
so?

01:29:54.746 --> 01:29:57.217
Out of the circle.

01:30:01.654 --> 01:30:02.485
Come on, you.

01:30:02.487 --> 01:30:05.255
Time to leave the circle of
trust.

01:30:09.895 --> 01:30:12.563
It's lidocaine, perfectly
harmless.

01:30:36.989 --> 01:30:38.921
You stupid bitch.

01:30:38.923 --> 01:30:41.660
You don't know what you've done!

01:31:06.884 --> 01:31:08.288
You're awake.

01:31:09.387 --> 01:31:10.319
Wait, don't move.

01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:11.488
Guys.

01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:12.892
Guys, she's awake.

01:31:13.825 --> 01:31:15.259
You'll be all right.

01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:15.928
I'm here.

01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:22.832
We were so worried.

01:31:23.503 --> 01:31:24.368
Don't try to speak.

01:31:24.370 --> 01:31:27.738
She can't speak, you insensitive
dick.

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.338
I'm sorry.

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.209
Here.

01:31:31.442 --> 01:31:32.609
Don't worry, detective.

01:31:32.611 --> 01:31:34.911
It's not like you ever had
anything interesting to say.

01:31:34.913 --> 01:31:36.512
You'd better watch yourself,
Perkins.

01:31:36.514 --> 01:31:38.915
You saw what she did with the
Ripper.

01:31:38.917 --> 01:31:40.684
We all saw what she did to
Smith.

01:31:40.686 --> 01:31:41.551
How the hell did
you do it?

01:31:41.553 --> 01:31:43.019
He's like twice your size.

01:31:43.021 --> 01:31:43.886
How did you know it was him?

01:31:43.888 --> 01:31:45.055
What was his motivation?

01:31:45.057 --> 01:31:46.689
All right, boys, let's break it
up.

01:31:46.691 --> 01:31:48.425
We can do this later.

01:31:48.427 --> 01:31:50.060
Rebecca needs her rest.

01:31:50.062 --> 01:31:51.028
Sorry.

01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:52.328
Sorry, detective.

01:31:52.330 --> 01:31:53.697
Yeah, you get some rest.

01:31:53.699 --> 01:31:55.931
We will be back in the morning.

01:31:55.933 --> 01:31:57.967
Good work, partner.

01:32:05.678 --> 01:32:07.013
What do you mean?

01:32:09.615 --> 01:32:12.619
It must be the
morphine.

01:32:15.353 --> 01:32:16.819
I don't understand.

01:32:24.829 --> 01:32:25.897
This is real.

01:32:26.898 --> 01:32:29.901
I'm sorry for everything, but it
is.

01:32:35.708 --> 01:32:38.110
Look into the light, please.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.646
You might feel a scratch.

01:32:43.648 --> 01:32:46.052
You can look away if you want.

01:33:56.521 --> 01:33:59.124
It's not going to work anymore.

01:34:44.353 --> 01:34:48.003
