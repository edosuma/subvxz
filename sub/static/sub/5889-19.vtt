WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:04.447
What you're asking me to do...

00:04.640 --> 00:09.009
...I appreciate that you turned
yourself in. You came back for me.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.929
<i>I'm in danger. I need the passports.</i>

00:11.120 --> 00:13.566
- I can't. I just can't.
- Liz, please!

00:13.760 --> 00:17.207
They're not just passports. You hid
them in a box under the floor in our home.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.767
They represent everything
I'm trying to forget.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.167
I wouldn't ask you
unless it was important.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.600
They're in evidence.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.962
That's exactly
why they should still be clean.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.527
I'm not gonna steal them,
why would I do that?

00:28.720 --> 00:31.451
You want me gone?
Do this and you'll never see me again.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.120
You need to leave. Go. Now.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.125
All units, shots fired at Euclid and Drake.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.769
- Echo 23 en route.
- Echo 28 en route. Copy.

00:41.960 --> 00:46.170
FBI-issued plate 7436,
uniform-sierra, under fire.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.131
Possible officer involved in shooting.

00:49.360 --> 00:54.002
One male confirmed down.
Repeat, plate 7436, uniform-sierra.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.321
Officer under fire.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.970
Stay down!

01:03.480 --> 01:06.245
- You have eyes?
- Fourth floor. East side.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.969
Look out! Down.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.970
We gotta get him out of here.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.089
- Got eyes!
- Let's go.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.167
Cooper, this is Keen.
Reddington is down.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.806
I repeat, he is down.
Shot and critical.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.447
- Shot? Where? Where are you?
- Euclid and Drake, headed southwest.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.210
- Lizzy, don't.
- Stay still.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.927
He's shot in the chest. I'm gonna
lose him if I don't get him to an ER.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.122
Reddington's shot. Euclid and Drake.
Providence?

02:05.320 --> 02:06.526
- No, University.
- University.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.199
- Trying to ping her phone.
- Are you secure? Unfriendlies?

02:09.360 --> 02:11.966
Unknown, but I'm gonna need
an escort and backup.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.403
- What are you doing?
- Keen? Agent Keen?

02:17.840 --> 02:19.205
Dial star, seven, seven.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.845
- What?
- Star, seven, seven.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.125
- Seventy-seven. What is your location?
- Who is this?

02:26.360 --> 02:28.522
- What is your location?
- Mr. Kaplan?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.724
- What is your location?
- Capitol and M.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.930
I don't know the plan,
but we need to get him to a hospital.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.771
- No hospitals.
- I'm sorry, but we don't have a choice.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.167
I'm not gonna let him die,
and it can't wait.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.922
- Mr. Kaplan?
- There's a warehouse.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.920
- 5312 Mass Avenue. Say it back.
- 5312 Mass Avenue.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.930
- Get there now. We'll be waiting.
- Who will?

02:57.640 --> 03:00.120
Hold on. Please. Just hold on.

One of our men on Euclid is dead.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.683
- And the target?
- Hit. Wounded. Still in play.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.963
They'll want to take our man to the ME.
That cannot happen.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.569
Still alive.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.690
I want eyes on any and all
medical resources he has.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.405
Get someone to the crime scene...

04:05.640 --> 04:08.962

He's shot in the chest, right side.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.529
Entered the intercostal in the eighth rib.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.167
- Absent breath sound in the right lung.
- BP is 60 over palp. Pulse thready.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.681
Abdomen's distended.
I need six units now.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.930
X-rays now.
Give me a tube. Give me a scope.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.204
He dropped a lung. Stat chest tube.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.331
You need...
You need to find Leonard Caul.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.251
- Caul?
- Leonard Caul.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.363
Talk to Dembe.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.051
You need to find him, Lizzy.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.250
- Get that line in. Quick.
- Stay with us.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.049
Gone? What do you mean, gone?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.481
We instructed Keen to go
to the ER at University.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.484
We cleared the floor.
They never showed.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.729
There's been an attempted assassination
in broad daylight.

06:19.920 --> 06:23.766
You know Reddington was hit
and yet he and Keen have disappeared?

06:23.960 --> 06:26.122
Well, that was certainly trial by fire.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.443
- Mr. Attorney General.
- Not for another week.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.961
Not ever if the press
has anything to say about it.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.283
I'm spinning gold about
all the great things Justice will do...

06:35.480 --> 06:38.529
...under my leadership,
with an aide whispering in my ear about...

06:38.720 --> 06:41.769
- We just found out ourselves.
- I was caught with my pants down...

06:42.000 --> 06:46.164
...and as three ex-wives can attest to,
it's not a pretty sight.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.924
Keen's gone AWOL.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.407
Why were they meeting?
Were they working a case?

06:51.640 --> 06:56.362
- I don't know the nature of the meeting.
- I don't need to tell you what's at stake.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.125
You need to contain this.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.368
Whatever it takes, whatever you need.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.490
The full resources of my office
are at your disposal.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.250
Thanks, Tom.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.009
Excuse me for a moment.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.127
- Cooper.
- Reddington's in surgery.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.722
Surgery? Where?
We've checked every ER in the city.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.766
We're in a warehouse,
5312 Mass Avenue.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.686
- He has some sort of mobile crash team.
- Dispatch units now.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.127
- Reddington gave me a name.
- Who?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.846
- Leonard Caul.
- Who is Leonard Caul?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.202
He knows about the people
who organized the hit.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.721
So Reddington knows
who's behind this.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.331
They came after Reddington...

07:38.560 --> 07:40.562
...because they thought he had
the Fulcrum.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.809
It's a blackmail file on a group,
this Cabal.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.048
He told them he had it and he didn't.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.402
They called his bluff
and tried to kill him...

07:48.600 --> 07:52.127
...and they will not stop until they do.
- Unless we find Leonard Caul.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.725
Nothing on him in the system.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.570
Dembe says before Fitch died...

07:55.760 --> 07:57.762
...he told Reddington to find Caul...

07:57.960 --> 08:01.123
...that he would have information
about the Fulcrum, the Cabal.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.721
Reddington asked Aram
to trace a call to an apartment...

08:03.960 --> 08:07.043
...but when they got there,
Caul was gone.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.369
- They found blood. No body.
- He didn't tell me what it was for...

08:10.560 --> 08:13.530
...and I didn't ask, but I could
probably pull up the location.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.890
We got a team on the way.
Stay safe for 15 minutes and you're home.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.525
We need to find the tear.
What are his vitals?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.927
BP is 90 over 60, pulse 140.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.727
I'm giving pressers and more fluids.
I need another unit of blood.

08:38.400 --> 08:43.440
- Aram traced the call to 3130 Sheridan.
- The name on the lease was an alias...

08:43.640 --> 08:47.201
...but the manager filed a police report,
he found blood in the home.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.051
So we pulled the admission logs
at the nearby ERs.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.810
Gunshot wounds,
domestic violence.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.049
And one guy who comes in with
his two fingers in a Ziploc bag.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.686
- Leonard Caul?
- He didn't leave a name.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.882
When he saw cops in the ER, he left.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.242
How do you know
he's the man we're looking for?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.926
We can't. But he left his fingers behind.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.646
Get me surveillance from that ER.
Interview the doctors.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.367
Contact Metro P.D.,
see if they ran the prints.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.327
- We've got company.
- Protective detail.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.168
We've got units securing the perimeter...

09:33.320 --> 09:36.961
- ...a chopper inbound to evac the patient.
- No, we're not...

09:42.040 --> 09:43.530
What the hell?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.642
The Bureau issues Glocks or Sigs.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.128
Whoever these gentlemen are,
they're not FBI.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.200
There will be more.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.891
How long before we can...?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.483
- What's his status?
- What?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.364
What is it? Can he be moved?

10:10.560 --> 10:13.291
- No. Maybe. I don't know.
- I need a definitive answer.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.767
- We have to go now.
- Go? We can't go.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.367
If we move him, he'll bleed to death.
We just found the compromised artery.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.562
We have to cauterize it before
we can close him.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.245
- So do it.
- That was his job.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.802
Does anyone here
have surgical training?

10:30.080 --> 10:32.765
- Two years, Fresno State.
- You're up, Fresno.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.571
- They're coming.
- Yes, I responded to their message.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.250
We have 15 or 20 minutes.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.081
Even he would need at least
30 minutes to close this tear.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.725
You have 15.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.331
- No. Absolutely not.
- Nick, please.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.170
I haven't heard from you
for three years.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.125
- I don't have any other choice.
- Find another doctor.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.527
- I had another doctor.
- Great. Use him.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.330
- I can't.
- Why?

10:59.520 --> 11:01.363
You turn down
his marriage proposal too?

11:01.560 --> 11:05.610
Listen to me, a man is going to die
if you don't help us. I'm begging you.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.171
Where do you want me to go?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.323
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.124
I didn't know where else to go.

11:51.720 --> 11:52.926
Over here.

11:53.120 --> 11:58.251
- Pulse is critical but stable.
- This is for you, Liz, not for him.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.644
Protective detail is at the warehouse.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.167
- No sign of Keen or Reddington.
- The first shooter...

12:14.360 --> 12:16.840
...the EMTs who were taking him
to the ME never showed.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.203
Three bodies found at the warehouse.
Two men posing as FBI...

12:20.400 --> 12:22.528
...and Dr. Mark Child,
chief of surgery at Georgetown.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.524
Agent Keen. Are you safe?

12:25.760 --> 12:28.491
- Who's with you?
- Ressler, Navabi, Mojtabai.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.451
- And who dispatched the detail?
- The D.C. field office.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.523
- That must be the leak.
- Where are you?

12:33.720 --> 12:36.007
- A safe house.
- Address? We'll send our own men now.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.166
- Reddington's team is here. We're secure.
- How is he?

12:39.960 --> 12:44.090
- He's... I don't know for sure, but
it's bad. COOPER: What do you need?

12:44.320 --> 12:47.051
- Tell us and we'll do it.
- I need you to find Leonard Caul.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.007
I thought you'd be gone.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.162
That was the plan.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.603
Then I thought maybe if I stayed,
I'd have a shot at a normal life.

13:01.840 --> 13:05.765
- Does Nick know what you got him into?
- He's not a part of this.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.169
- He's just a doctor.
- Reddington's a bad man, Liz.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.160
He's bad for anyone who comes in
contact with him. He's bad for you.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.842
His world, this right here,
unless you get out, this will devour you.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.408
It doesn't matter if he's bad.
What matters is he has answers about me.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.170
I'm staying until I get them.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.289
Maybe I could help you
get those answers.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.721
- I doubt that.
- I know more about Reddington...

13:26.920 --> 13:28.251
...than you think.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.082
The bullet nicked the right lung.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.282
I was able to reinflate it
with a chest tube.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.244
We'll start him on an antibiotic.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.044
- The bullet?
- That's the problem.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.564
It has a percussion cap,
which causes it to essentially explode.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.531
By some miracle, it didn't.
If I try to remove it...

13:47.760 --> 13:49.524
...if I touch it the wrong way...

13:49.760 --> 13:52.650
There's a land mine inside him
and you're asking me to dig it up.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.080
Can you do it or not?

13:55.800 --> 13:59.327
We were never formally introduced.
When we met, you were in her kitchen...

13:59.560 --> 14:02.530
...making coffee in your underwear.
- If it's any consolation...

14:02.720 --> 14:04.768
...she dumped me too.
- Can you do it?

14:04.960 --> 14:07.930
You may not remember,
but I worked my way through school.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.964
Nights, weekends, and I still had
to take out loans.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.922
I busted my hump,
and I am still $376,422 in debt.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.447
Can I do it? Absolutely.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.486
For $376,422.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.805
I know who he is.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.688
I don't why he's here or what you
have to do with him, but I know.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.450
Five hundred thousand.
Unmarked, untraceable.

14:36.680 --> 14:40.048
Mr. Reddington insists on being
prepared for all contingencies.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.561
Shall we continue?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.525
We checked with NCIC.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.371
Prints they ran on our
mystery man were a dead end.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.846
No criminal record.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.048
- Wasn't in the system.
- He was in Mossad's.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.767
Leonard Caul's real name is
Joseph McCray. He's former CIA.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.446
Last known photograph
dates back to 1981.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.120
Part of Operation Harvvood...

15:05.240 --> 15:08.722
...a covert surveillance unit in Managua
to keep tabs on the Sandinistas.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.242
The agency knows who he is,
but they won't say. Classified.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.171
His job is to blend in.
He's eyes and ears, nothing else.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.160
- He may as well have been a ghost.
- Harwood was run by Helen Jubal.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.011
Senate committee shut it down
in the wake of Iran-Contra.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.725
Tom Connolly was legal counsel.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.163
- You think Connolly can get her to talk?
- I'll ask him.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.687
We've been trading a few favors lately.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.286
I could be arrested for even
acknowledging Mr. McCray exists.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.206
As luck would have it,
I know a few people in law enforcement.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.528
Tommy said you were
a smooth operator.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.882
He says you can help me find
Leonard Caul...

15:46.080 --> 15:48.242
...or the man you know as Mr. McCray.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.841
- Haven't spoken to him in years.
- Is that a fact?

15:51.040 --> 15:53.407
The unit broke up.
He didn't take it well, became...

15:53.640 --> 15:55.608
Ms. Jubal, let's cut to it, shall we?

15:56.640 --> 16:00.326
McCray was an agent of yours.
He's in trouble, on the run.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.962
The next attorney general gave me carte
blanche to inquire to as his whereabouts.

16:04.160 --> 16:08.529
Anyone obstructing that inquiry
will have to answer to him.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.248
He came to me recently.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.606
He was wrapped up in some kind
of business with Raymond Reddington.

16:22.520 --> 16:27.526
Hm. That's what this is about.
Your hunt for Reddington.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.041
Ms. Jubal, tell me where he is.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.006
He's scared, hurt, had no place to go.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.204
I'm assuming because of Reddington.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.811
If I tell you where he is...

16:39.000 --> 16:44.086
...do you promise to use that information
only as a means to find Reddington?

16:46.080 --> 16:47.525
You have my word.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.922
Elizabeth.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.202
In Bethesda,
there's a small second-story flat.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.880
In the flat, you will find a desk.

17:24.079 --> 17:29.291
The middle drawer has a false front. Inside,
you'll find a silver case and a key.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.808
- This is about the Fulcrum.
- Yes. You still have it?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.082
I do. This case, the key.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.689
I need you to bring them here
to Raymond, to Leonard Caul.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.522
That's why we needed to find Caul...

17:42.720 --> 17:45.246
...because he can decipher
the Fulcrum.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.282
He's gonna be okay.

17:52.320 --> 17:57.042
This flat, Raymond can never
know you were there.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.122
Do you understand, Elizabeth?

18:00.320 --> 18:05.121
I would go if I could, but I can't.
I can't leave him alone.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.005
Raymond must never
know you were there.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.843
Where are we with this thing?

18:34.040 --> 18:37.726
According to Agent Keen, Reddington
is in surgery. It's touch and go.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.445
In surgery?
What's their location?

18:39.680 --> 18:42.729
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- I suggest you take the liberty.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.443
We have a lead on Leonard Caul.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.842
Jubal tipped us
to a safe house in Alexandria.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.281
- We're looking into it.
- That's not what I asked.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.887
I asked for the location of Reddington.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.163
He's right to keep us out of the loop.
You know the protocol.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.882
If there's the slightest suspicion
of a leak, information is need-to-know.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.209
- I trust Agent Keen.
- After the harbormaster?

19:03.400 --> 19:05.846
I'm beginning to regret sweeping
that under the rug.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.209
She kept this Fulcrum secret, a blackmail
file on some nefarious group...

19:09.400 --> 19:12.085
...and then she gave
this file to Reddington?

19:12.280 --> 19:16.410
- I don't know that she gave it to him.
- I appreciate your loyalty to Agent Keen...

19:16.600 --> 19:19.570
...but you have to admit
there's a possibility...

19:19.800 --> 19:22.565
...she's being completely manipulated
by Reddington.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.882
What if he chose her
in the first place...

19:25.080 --> 19:28.004
...because he wanted to get
his hands on this thing?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.726
What if that's the real reason
he turned himself in?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.046
I don't believe that.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.641
All this talk about
some personal connection...

19:34.840 --> 19:37.161
...between Reddington and Keen,
why he chose her...

19:37.400 --> 19:39.289
...some shared history...

19:39.480 --> 19:42.723
...what if Reddington doesn't care
about Agent Keen...

19:42.920 --> 19:45.844
...and it's all been a manipulation?

19:50.800 --> 19:53.246
Hey, sweetheart.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.083
Hi, kitty.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.088
The doctor says you did well.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.251
- Elizabeth?
- She's fine.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.921
- You need to go to my flat.
- I'm taking care of it.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.567
You were right, Dembe.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.931
I should've told her.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.644
I understand why you didn't.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.042
No, you don't.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.964
The blessing of an honest man.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.089
She still hasn't found Caul.

21:34.120 --> 21:39.126
She won't.
But if she looks for him, he'll find her.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.643
Hello, Agent Keen. Why don't we go
back inside and have a little chat.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.329
Don't take it.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.449
You take it,
he'll have his hooks in you.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.563
Trust me, it's the last thing you want.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.645
I'm not a criminal.
Never even gotten a speeding ticket.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.808
Don't take it.

22:31.560 --> 22:36.521
When I heard you two were getting
married, I was happy for her.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.646
- People said you were okay, a teacher.
- Heh, heh.

22:41.160 --> 22:46.007
Later on, they told me you were planning
to adopt a child and start a family.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.722
Guess you two decided
to go another route.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.930
- I won't take you to Reddington.
- Yes, you will.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.203
You tried to kill him in the street today,
at the warehouse.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.522
The Cabal tried to kill him.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.884
It's what they do,
eliminate their enemies.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.120
You're Leonard Caul.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.364
Reddington sent you to find me.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.325
- What's your connection to Reddington?
- Alan Fitch.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.090
I believe he wanted us to meet.

23:23.760 --> 23:27.845
Shortly after Reddington contacted me,
there was an attempt on my life.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.288
- That's when I knew I could trust him.
- When someone tried to kill you?

23:31.480 --> 23:35.246
Yes, the Cabal, to keep us apart.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.849
I've been in hiding ever since...

23:38.040 --> 23:42.250
...watching, waiting for a signal from
Reddington that it was safe to meet.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.006
- He sent word earlier today.
- He was shot earlier today.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.568
I know. He sent word after...

23:49.240 --> 23:50.366
...through you.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.286
He knew you'd be watching.

23:52.480 --> 23:57.771
I don't like having the FBI running
my prints, accessing my covert files...

23:57.960 --> 23:59.644
...talking with my former CO.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.083
When I saw that happening,
I knew it meant one of two things.

24:03.280 --> 24:07.490
You either want to arrest me
or talk to me.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.808
Which is it, Agent Keen?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.843
Tell me what you know
about the Fulcrum.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.526
Is that the interface?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.124
You don't know how it works.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.884
If you trust him, Agent Keen,
you will show it to me.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.201
It's what he wants.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.923
He gave you a key.

25:09.360 --> 25:13.001
You know, that day at the hospital...

25:14.600 --> 25:17.683
...the day Sam died,
I think about that day a lot.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.081
I worked for you two years,
we never met.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.767
You were always this shadow...

25:29.040 --> 25:33.443
...moving from place to place,
talked about but never seen. And then...

25:35.480 --> 25:36.970
There you were.

25:37.960 --> 25:42.887
To see you sitting there after I'd betrayed
your trust, gone to work for Berlin...

25:43.080 --> 25:44.286
...I was terrified.

25:45.400 --> 25:50.361
I sat there listening to you
threaten me...

25:51.640 --> 25:54.246
...threaten anyone who could hurt Liz.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.567
And all I could think was you...

26:00.160 --> 26:02.891
You are the one
who hurts Liz the most.

26:04.880 --> 26:08.123
She's here in this right now
because of you.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.563
And I know I played a part in that,
and I'm not saying I didn't...

26:11.760 --> 26:15.845
...but I'm trying to fix that.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.565
So I told her the truth about us.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.682
I don't want you to be confused...

26:23.880 --> 26:27.726
...about my part in any of this,
you, Liz.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.922
All of it. I'm out.

26:31.880 --> 26:32.927
I'm done.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.769
There's a device, a bubble module.
It's the size of a quarter.

26:53.640 --> 26:57.087
Smartest person I know couldn't
figure out how to read this.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.964
That's because
he didn't have the cipher text.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.969
- How did you get it?
- I didn't get it.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.886
I wrote it.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.086
First time I saw it, I was speechless too.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.849
Some of the names on that list,
people, they're...

27:45.280 --> 27:49.251
...CEO's, defense contractors,
intelligence officers from China...

27:49.480 --> 27:50.925
...India, all over the world.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.487
Those names you saw,
those are just the beginning.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.206
- Fitch was part of it.
- He'd been cut out of the loop.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.171
Director didn't trust him.
That's why Fitch reached out to me.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.002
- The Director?
- Yes.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.208
Clandestine Services.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.167
Are you telling me
the Director of Clandestine...

28:07.360 --> 28:08.805
Yes.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.728
- Keep driving.
- But we're here.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.247
Keep driving.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.526
We're compromised.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.961
You're surrounded.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.686
- Where are you?
- Close. They're coming, be ready.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.611
- Reddington, what's his condition?
- He's better.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.406
- But he's gonna get us killed.
- I'm calling for backup.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.490
I got hostiles at Crescent to the north,
more to the west.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.127
Give me a gun. You don't want the help,
I'm happy to leave.

- Talk to me. What's going on?
- Our site's compromised.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.410
I don't know by who. Reddington's
inside and he can't be moved.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.650
- I need you to send units now.
- Agent Ressler, notify HRT.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.162
- I want Hopkins and his team only.
- Copy that.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.567

- You're outnumbered.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.411
- We have to go back.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.683
They'll kill Reddington.
They'll kill everyone. I can't walk away.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.247
You can. If you know what's good,
you'll keep walking.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.522
- What's that mean?
- The Director never believed...

29:26.720 --> 29:29.405
...Reddington had the Fulcrum.
When Fitch died, it was inevitable...

29:29.600 --> 29:33.161
...that the Director would call his bluff.
- That's it.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.728
What? Agent Keen,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.651

I don't care what it takes.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.091
- Oh, not now.
- It's Elizabeth Keen.

33:05.280 --> 33:09.046
She says she has information
about something called the Fulcrum.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.566
Thank you.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.371
We are going to have to postpone.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.042
- The president is expecting us...
- The president will have to wait.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.289
If you'll excuse us.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.609
That will be all.

33:34.800 --> 33:39.362
I admire your nerve, Agent Keen,
barging in here like this.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.483
But I'm afraid it's too late.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.206
Well, then you're gonna
have to read about this...

33:44.400 --> 33:46.926
...in tomorrow's New York Times.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.531
The Fulcrum.
You didn't think Reddington had it.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.286
Well, here it is,
and it tells quite a story.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.404
Political assassinations, terrorism.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.688
We know who you are, what you've done.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.726
You called Reddington's bluff
and you lost.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.170
- Call it off.
- I told you it's too late.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.203
Pick up the phone and call it off.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.524
You have no idea the enemies
you've just made.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.722
I'm afraid I do.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.169
You can keep that. We have copies.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.526
I never saw it before.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.321
Saw what?

35:36.480 --> 35:38.960
How much you look like your mother.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.480
Lizzy.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.604
There's a wing at Sibley Memorial
for you and your medical team.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.963
Cooper will oversee
your security personally.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.929
Lizzy.

36:25.160 --> 36:30.166
- When I hired Torn Keen...
- Don't. There's nothing you can say.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.443
When I hired Torn Keen...

36:33.640 --> 36:39.727
...it was at a time of profound
transition in your life.

36:40.160 --> 36:45.769
You'd already left behind the relative
safety and innocence of youth.

36:45.960 --> 36:50.682
Sam's care as a father had served
you well, but you'd outgrown him.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.851
And I knew that eventually...

36:55.640 --> 36:58.246
...my life would jeopardize yours.

36:59.120 --> 37:04.604
So in an admittedly presumptuous
and ultimately...

37:04.800 --> 37:07.929
...futile effort to keep you safe...

37:08.160 --> 37:12.609
...I hired Tom,
simply to be there as a friend...

37:12.800 --> 37:18.967
...of a friend, to look after you
from an arm's length.

37:19.160 --> 37:24.087
When I learned that your relationship
had become intimate...

37:25.400 --> 37:26.970
...I fired him.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.651
I should've removed him...

37:31.840 --> 37:34.605
...but you were already in love with him.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.007
And Tom...

37:37.200 --> 37:41.762
...he shifted his allegiance to Berlin,
in part, to protect himself from me...

37:41.960 --> 37:45.328
...but also because it allowed for...

37:45.520 --> 37:48.967
...an inextricable intimacy...

37:49.200 --> 37:52.124
...and commitment to you.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.647
And so you were married.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.045
And I couldn't stay away any longer.

38:00.360 --> 38:05.321
A confluence of peril
had entered your life...

38:05.960 --> 38:10.204
...and I wanted to be within reach...

38:10.960 --> 38:12.769
...to have influence.

38:13.920 --> 38:19.290
I turned myself in to the FBI
to point you...

38:20.000 --> 38:22.446
...toward a truth...

38:23.600 --> 38:29.084
...that inevitably you would
have to discover for yourself.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.528
Is that all of it?

38:39.480 --> 38:40.970
Some of it.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.490
Why couldn't you just have said yes?

38:50.960 --> 38:55.522
It wouldn't kill you to lie just once
to make someone feel good.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.845
I understand you're conflicted.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.361
Lives were lost today.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.162
But the work we do is important.

39:13.440 --> 39:17.081
We help provide peace, stability.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.729
Children can go to school,
families to church without fear...

39:22.480 --> 39:25.529
...or certainly with less of it,
because of us.

39:25.720 --> 39:28.166
You wanted to be a part of that.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.201
It's a solemn responsibility...

39:31.400 --> 39:34.802
...and, on days like today, a heavy one.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.971
Few people are capable
of honoring that responsibility.

39:39.240 --> 39:43.643
You are, we know that,
and we believe in you.

39:44.160 --> 39:48.051
We also know that
we asked you to betray a friend.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.887
But you want a seat at the table.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.361
Now you have one.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.847
Came as soon as I could.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.570
I think you're right.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.964
Reddington...

40:39.720 --> 40:41.882
What happened today...

40:44.080 --> 40:47.641
- I think it's gonna devour me.
- What I said...

40:49.400 --> 40:52.643
What I meant was that it would
devour most people.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.801
It's not gonna devour you.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.288
You said you could help me
find answers.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.250
Yeah.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.569
I think I can.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.491
Tell me what you know
about Reddington.
