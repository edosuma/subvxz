00:32.866 --> 00:33.633
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:33.700 --> 00:34.733
COMING TO YOU FROM THIS BLANK

00:34.800 --> 00:36.600
VOID.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.266
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER EVENTFUL WEEK,

00:38.333 --> 00:42.200
WITH MORE ELECTIONS, THIS TIME

00:42.266 --> 00:42.900
IN NEW YORK AND KENTUCKY,

00:42.966 --> 00:43.500
PLAGUED BY LONG LINES, AND THE

00:43.566 --> 00:44.200
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRYING YET

00:44.266 --> 00:44.900
AGAIN TO DISMANTLE THE

00:44.966 --> 00:45.566
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

00:45.633 --> 00:46.500
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING WE

00:46.566 --> 00:47.133
HAVE TOO MUCH OF RIGHT NOW, IT'S

00:47.200 --> 00:48.566
HEALTHCARE.

00:48.633 --> 00:49.533
AND YET, ONCE MORE,

00:49.600 --> 00:51.900
THE NEWS HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY

00:51.966 --> 00:52.500
THE CORONAVIRUS -- AMONG OTHER

00:52.566 --> 00:53.266
THINGS, THE WORST THING TO

00:53.333 --> 00:54.366
HAPPEN TO WEDDINGS

00:54.433 --> 00:55.600
SINCE FLASH MOBS.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.966
THE U.S. IS NOW SETTING RECORDS

00:58.033 --> 01:00.233
FOR DAILY NEW CASES AS THE VIRUS

01:00.300 --> 01:01.566
SURGES AROUND THE COUNTRY, WHICH

01:01.633 --> 01:05.466
MAKES IT BOTH STARTLING AND

01:05.533 --> 01:06.866
FRANKLY INFURIATING THAT, ON

01:06.933 --> 01:08.266
FRIDAY, THE VICE PRESIDENT MADE

01:08.333 --> 01:08.666
THIS DECLARATION.

01:08.733 --> 01:09.366
>> THE TRUTH IS, WE DID SLOW THE

01:09.433 --> 01:10.833
SPREAD, WE FLATTENED THE CURVE,

01:10.900 --> 01:12.600
WE WERE ABLE TO STAND UP THE

01:12.666 --> 01:14.300
RESOURCES AND THE CAPACITIES IN

01:14.366 --> 01:16.166
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE

01:16.233 --> 01:17.966
TO MEET THIS CORONAVIRUS, UH, IN

01:18.033 --> 01:20.466
A WAY THAT WOULD PUT THE HEALTH

01:20.533 --> 01:25.266
OF ALL OF OUR COUNTRY FIRST.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.133
>> John: WHAT?

01:26.200 --> 01:26.966
THAT IS JUST SUCH AN

01:27.033 --> 01:27.866
OPEN AND STUPID LIE.

01:27.933 --> 01:29.400
IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING

01:29.466 --> 01:32.400
"YOUR DOG IS ON A FARM UPSTATE,"

01:32.466 --> 01:33.333
YOUR DAD SAID "YOUR DOG OWNS A

01:33.400 --> 01:34.433
FARM UPSTATE THAT HAS THE MARKET

01:34.500 --> 01:35.600
CORNERED IN WHOLESALE WHEAT AND

01:35.666 --> 01:36.566
GRAIN SUPPLIES FOR THE ENTIRETY

01:36.633 --> 01:37.900
OF SARATOGA COUNTY."

01:37.966 --> 01:39.366
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.400
THE DOG IS DEAD AND SO ARE OVER

01:42.466 --> 01:45.100
120,000 AMERICANS.

01:45.166 --> 01:47.533
AND ON TOP OF THAT, PENCE ALSO

01:47.600 --> 01:49.800
CONSPICUOUSLY OMITTED "WEARING A

01:49.866 --> 01:50.933
MASK" FROM ADVICE HE GAVE FOR

01:51.000 --> 01:52.966
SLOWING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS.

01:53.033 --> 01:53.866
AND I'LL JUST NEVER UNDERSTAND

01:53.933 --> 01:55.366
WHY -- OR EVEN HOW --

01:55.433 --> 01:56.600
REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE "NOT

01:56.666 --> 01:57.633
SPREADING DISEASE" INTO A

01:57.700 --> 01:58.900
CULTURE WAR ISSUE.

01:58.966 --> 01:59.800
HONESTLY, THIS WAS A MISSED

01:59.866 --> 02:01.466
OPPORTUNITY.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.000
YOU COULD'VE PRINTED

02:03.066 --> 02:04.766
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" ON A

02:04.833 --> 02:05.600
BILLION RED MASKS AND DROPPED

02:05.666 --> 02:07.833
THEM OUT OF HELICOPTERS.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.666
PEOPLE WOULD'VE WORN THEM.

02:08.733 --> 02:09.833
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CAPITALIZING ON

02:09.900 --> 02:11.400
A NATIONAL DISASTER CORRECTLY,

02:11.466 --> 02:13.033
YOU FUCKING IDIOTS.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.133
AND IT'S NOTABLE THAT SOME OF

02:15.200 --> 02:16.700
THE STATES THAT WERE MOST

02:16.766 --> 02:17.766
AGGRESSIVE ABOUT REOPENING FOR

02:17.833 --> 02:19.166
BUSINESS, LIKE TEXAS AND

02:19.233 --> 02:21.000
FLORIDA, ARE NOW SEEING SOME OF

02:21.066 --> 02:22.566
THE WORST SPIKES IN CASES,

02:22.633 --> 02:23.933
MAKING THEIR GOVERNORS' EARLY

02:24.000 --> 02:29.033
PROCLAMATIONS OF SUCCESS SEEM

02:29.100 --> 02:31.500
PRETTY ILL-ADVISED, PERHAPS NONE

02:31.566 --> 02:32.966
MORE SO THAN THIS FROM

02:33.033 --> 02:33.566
RON DeSANTIS JUST LAST MONTH:

02:33.633 --> 02:34.366
>> YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

02:34.433 --> 02:35.266
YOUR PROFESSION WHO WAXED

02:35.333 --> 02:36.233
POETICALLY FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS

02:36.300 --> 02:37.233
ABOUT HOW FLORIDA WAS GONNA BE

02:37.300 --> 02:38.566
JUST LIKE NEW YORK, "WAIT TWO

02:38.633 --> 02:39.466
WEEKS, FLORIDA'S GONNA BE NEXT.

02:39.533 --> 02:40.566
JUST LIKE ITALY, WAIT TWO

02:40.633 --> 02:41.733
WEEKS."

02:41.800 --> 02:43.400
WELL, HELL, WE'RE EIGHT WEEKS

02:43.466 --> 02:44.266
AWAY FROM THAT AND IT HASN'T

02:44.333 --> 02:45.600
HAPPENED.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.366
>> John: OH, REALLY?

02:47.433 --> 02:49.333
JUST AS A GENERAL THOUGHT, I

02:49.400 --> 02:51.000
BADLY WANT RON DeSANTIS TO GO ON

02:51.066 --> 02:52.533
A LENGTHY TIRADE ABOUT HOW HE

02:52.600 --> 02:53.766
HAS NEVER BEEN HIT BY LIGHTNING

02:53.833 --> 02:57.366
AND NEVER WILL BE.

02:57.433 --> 02:58.300
COME ON, RON, PLEASE.

02:58.366 --> 02:59.266
YOU SHOW THAT LIBERAL LIGHTNING

02:59.333 --> 03:00.800
HOAX WHO'S BOSS.

03:00.866 --> 03:02.133
BUT THE CONTINUING SPREAD OF THE

03:02.200 --> 03:03.766
CORONAVIRUS ACTUALLY BRINGS US

03:03.833 --> 03:07.900
TO OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

03:07.966 --> 03:08.866
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUGE

03:08.933 --> 03:09.466
COVID-RELATED CATASTROPHE THAT

03:09.533 --> 03:10.933
IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

03:11.000 --> 03:11.766
>> HUNDREDS OF TENANTS RALLYING

03:11.833 --> 03:13.600
THIS WEEK DEMANDING RENT RELIEF.

03:13.666 --> 03:15.400
THEY WARN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

03:15.466 --> 03:16.600
COULD SEE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF

03:16.666 --> 03:17.933
EVICTION CASES EVER.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.333
>> John: YEAH.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.266
AS IF THINGS WEREN'T ALREADY BAD

03:21.333 --> 03:22.633
ENOUGH, IN THE MIDDLE OF A

03:22.700 --> 03:24.100
PANDEMIC, WE MAY BE ABOUT TO SEE

03:24.166 --> 03:26.733
EVICTIONS ON THE RISE.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.533
AND ON THE LIST OF THINGS YOU

03:28.600 --> 03:29.266
HOPE NEVER TO SEE ON THE RISE,

03:29.333 --> 03:31.266
EVICTIONS HAVE TO BE RIGHT UP AT

03:31.333 --> 03:32.566
THE TOP, TIED, OF COURSE, WITH

03:32.633 --> 03:34.666
LARRY KING'S PENIS.

03:34.733 --> 03:35.900
THAT THING GOING UP IS JUST NOT

03:35.966 --> 03:37.066
WHAT OUR CURRENT SITUATION

03:37.133 --> 03:38.966
REQUIRES.

03:39.033 --> 03:43.900
AND WHILE EVICTIONS RISING IS

03:43.966 --> 03:47.600
SHOCKING, IT WAS ALSO

03:47.666 --> 03:49.266
COMPLETELY FORESEEABLE.

03:49.333 --> 03:49.833
CORONAVIRUS HAS PLAYED HAVOC

03:49.900 --> 03:50.466
WITH EMPLOYMENT, MAKING IT

03:50.533 --> 03:51.633
DIFFICULT FOR MANY TO MAKE RENT,

03:51.700 --> 03:52.266
WHICH WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE

03:52.333 --> 03:53.133
SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES, GIVEN

03:53.200 --> 03:54.133
THAT ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF U.S.

03:54.200 --> 03:54.866
HOUSEHOLDS ARE RENTERS, AND

03:54.933 --> 03:55.900
RENTERS TEND TO HAVE LOWER

03:55.966 --> 03:57.000
INCOMES THAN HOMEOWNERS IN THE

03:57.066 --> 03:58.566
FIRST PLACE.

03:58.633 --> 03:59.900
AND WHILE STIMULUS CHECKS,

03:59.966 --> 04:01.033
EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,

04:01.100 --> 04:02.566
AND STATE AND FEDERAL

04:02.633 --> 04:04.300
MORATORIUMS ON EVICTIONS

04:04.366 --> 04:05.866
UNDOUBTEDLY HELPED HOLD BACK THE

04:05.933 --> 04:09.933
TIDE, THOSE MECHANISMS ARE

04:10.000 --> 04:10.500
NOW STARTING TO RUN OUT OR

04:10.566 --> 04:11.366
EXPIRE.

04:11.433 --> 04:13.033
AND IF WE DO NOTHING, EXPERTS

04:13.100 --> 04:13.700
ARE PREDICTING HORRIFIC

04:13.766 --> 04:14.666
OUTCOMES, WITH MILLIONS OF

04:14.733 --> 04:16.466
PEOPLE LEFT VULNERABLE.

04:16.533 --> 04:17.533
>> THIS IS THE WORST ECONOMIC

04:17.600 --> 04:19.000
CRISIS THE UNITED STATES HAS

04:19.066 --> 04:21.233
SEEN IN GENERATIONS.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.866
IF NOTHING ELSE CHANGES AND

04:22.933 --> 04:24.800
EVICTIONS CONTINUE AS NORMAL,

04:24.866 --> 04:26.433
THEN THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

04:26.500 --> 04:27.366
WILL TURN INTO A FULL-BLOWN

04:27.433 --> 04:29.066
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.533
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.766
THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS COULD

04:34.833 --> 04:35.466
ALSO SOON TURN INTO A FULL-BLOWN

04:35.533 --> 04:36.300
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

04:36.366 --> 04:37.366
AND IT'S HARD TO EVEN FATHOM

04:37.433 --> 04:39.266
SOMETHING ALREADY SO BAD

04:39.333 --> 04:40.766
TRANSFORMING INTO SOMETHING ELSE

04:40.833 --> 04:42.033
SO APPALLING.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.400
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT

04:43.466 --> 04:44.466
MAGIKARP -- OBJECTIVELY THE

04:44.533 --> 04:45.666
WORST POKEMON, FOR OBVIOUS

04:45.733 --> 04:47.333
REASONS -- IS SET TO EVOLVE INTO

04:47.400 --> 04:49.533
KEVIN SPACEY.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.266
I SHOULD'VE TRADED YOU FOR

04:51.333 --> 04:53.300
PSYDUCK WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

04:53.366 --> 04:55.300
AND IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE

04:55.366 --> 04:56.666
UTTER ABSURDITY OF WHAT'S ABOUT

04:56.733 --> 04:57.833
TO HAPPEN THAT THIS IS HOW SOME

04:57.900 --> 04:59.033
EVICTION HEARINGS WILL BE TAKING

04:59.100 --> 05:00.733
PLACE:

05:00.800 --> 05:02.000
>> STARTING WITH TOMORROW'S

05:02.066 --> 05:03.600
DOCKET, JUDGE LOPEZ WILL START

05:03.666 --> 05:05.266
HEARING EVICTION CASES, EITHER

05:05.333 --> 05:07.166
IN THE COURT USING WEBCAMS WITH

05:07.233 --> 05:08.733
THE DEFENDANT AND THE PLAINTIFF

05:08.800 --> 05:09.766
IN SEPARATE ROOMS, OVER ZOOM, OR

05:09.833 --> 05:12.066
EVEN ON THE PHONE.

05:12.133 --> 05:14.833
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.066
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE WORTH

05:16.133 --> 05:17.233
THINKING TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE

05:17.300 --> 05:18.833
TAKING PART IN IF YOU'RE

05:18.900 --> 05:19.400
THROWING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR

05:19.466 --> 05:20.433
HOMES VIA ZOOM, A PLATFORM

05:20.500 --> 05:21.066
YOU'RE ONLY USING BECAUSE IT'S

05:21.133 --> 05:22.233
NOT SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO LEAVE

05:22.300 --> 05:24.100
THEIR HOMES.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.133
BESIDES, ZOOM SHOULDN'T BE WHERE

05:25.200 --> 05:26.633
YOU FIND OUT YOU'RE GETTING

05:26.700 --> 05:27.766
EVICTED.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.166
IT SHOULD BE WHERE YOU FIND OUT

05:29.233 --> 05:30.333
IN A VIRTUAL HAPPY HOUR WHICH

05:30.400 --> 05:31.466
ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS HAS BEEN

05:31.533 --> 05:32.533
SECRETLY RICH THE WHOLE TIME.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.733
I'M SORRY, JOANNA HAS A

05:33.800 --> 05:35.700
CHANDELIER?

05:35.766 --> 05:37.166
WHERE DID SHE GET CHANDELIER

05:37.233 --> 05:38.466
MONEY?

05:38.533 --> 05:39.700
WHY DON'T I HAVE CHANDELIER

05:39.766 --> 05:42.266
MONEY?

05:42.333 --> 05:43.966
LOOK, THE FACT IS, WE'RE ABOUT

05:44.033 --> 05:45.300
TOO OUT OF OUR WAY TO THROW

05:45.366 --> 05:46.500
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES AT THE

05:46.566 --> 05:48.166
WORST POSSIBLE TIME.

05:48.233 --> 05:49.133
AND EVEN IN NORMAL TIMES,

05:49.200 --> 05:50.133
EVICTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY

05:50.200 --> 05:52.500
DAMAGING, WITH LONG, LONG-TERM

05:52.566 --> 05:54.400
EFFECTS.

05:54.466 --> 05:56.166
ON THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, THEY'VE

05:56.233 --> 05:57.000
BEEN LINKED TO HEIGHTENED

05:57.066 --> 05:57.833
RESIDENTIAL INSTABILITY,

05:57.900 --> 05:59.000
SUBSTANDARD HOUSING, DECLINES IN

05:59.066 --> 06:00.633
NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY, AND JOB

06:00.700 --> 06:02.133
LOSS, AND ON THE INDIVIDUAL

06:02.200 --> 06:04.166
LEVEL, THEY CAN BE COMPLETELY

06:04.233 --> 06:06.566
DEVASTATING IN WAYS YOU MAY NOT

06:06.633 --> 06:07.833
EVEN REALIZE, FROM FAMILIES

06:07.900 --> 06:09.333
LOSING THEIR POSSESSIONS AND

06:09.400 --> 06:11.000
HAVING TO START OVER, TO

06:11.066 --> 06:12.266
SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES IN

06:12.333 --> 06:13.500
OBTAINING NEW HOUSING, SOMETHING

06:13.566 --> 06:15.066
THAT CAN BE HARD TO DO WITH AN

06:15.133 --> 06:16.966
EVICTION ON YOUR RECORD.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.333
EVICTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT

06:18.400 --> 06:19.733
CAN HAUNT YOU FOR THE REST OF

06:19.800 --> 06:21.366
YOUR LIFE.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.600
SO TONIGHT, WITH RENT DUE IN

06:22.666 --> 06:24.800
JUST THREE DAYS, WE THOUGHT IT

06:24.866 --> 06:26.166
MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO TALK

06:26.233 --> 06:27.966
ABOUT EVICTIONS.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.700
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

06:29.766 --> 06:30.933
THAT THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE

06:31.000 --> 06:32.166
HOUSING IS YET ANOTHER SYSTEMIC

06:32.233 --> 06:34.266
PROBLEM THAT THE CORONAVIRUS HAS

06:34.333 --> 06:35.633
THROWN INTO HARSH RELIEF,

06:35.700 --> 06:36.900
BECAUSE TO BE CLEAR, IT WAS A

06:36.966 --> 06:38.566
CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY LONG

06:38.633 --> 06:39.833
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK, WITH

06:39.900 --> 06:43.100
RENTS SO HIGH AND RENTERS SO

06:43.166 --> 06:44.633
BURDENED THAT STORIES LIKE THESE

06:44.700 --> 06:47.266
BECAME A STAPLE ON LOCAL NEWS:

06:47.333 --> 06:48.800
>> A CHAOTIC SCENE AS HUNDREDS

06:48.866 --> 06:52.500
MAKE A RUN FOR THE DOOR AND A

06:52.566 --> 06:53.200
CHANCE AT DALLAS COUNTY HOUSING

06:53.266 --> 06:54.866
VOUCHERS.

06:54.933 --> 06:55.733
AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE SUFFERED

06:55.800 --> 06:56.366
INJURIES WHILE TRYING TO LINE UP

06:56.433 --> 06:57.033
THIS MORNING.

06:57.100 --> 06:57.933
>> I SAW PEOPLE RUN, SO I

06:58.000 --> 06:59.766
STARTED RUNNING AND I SLIPPED

06:59.833 --> 07:02.400
AND FELL ALL OVER THE PAVEMENT.

07:02.466 --> 07:03.766
>> JORDAN SPIVEY IS ALL SCUFFED

07:03.833 --> 07:05.100
UP AFTER TAKING QUITE A TUMBLE

07:05.166 --> 07:06.700
THIS MORNING BUT GRATEFUL SHE

07:06.766 --> 07:10.000
WASN'T TRAMPLED TOO.

07:10.066 --> 07:10.900
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

07:10.966 --> 07:12.066
NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE TRAMPLED

07:12.133 --> 07:13.300
BY A CROWD OF PEOPLE OUT OF

07:13.366 --> 07:14.100
DESPERATION TO GET RENTAL

07:14.166 --> 07:15.300
ASSISTANCE.

07:15.366 --> 07:16.300
THERE ARE ONLY TWO TIMES WHEN

07:16.366 --> 07:17.333
TRAMPLING IS REMOTELY

07:17.400 --> 07:18.566
ACCEPTABLE: THE DAY AFTER

07:18.633 --> 07:20.300
THANKSGIVING -- THAT'S AMERICA'S

07:20.366 --> 07:21.300
NATIONAL TRAMPLING HOLIDAY --

07:21.366 --> 07:22.733
AND WHATEVER DAY IN THE FUTURE

07:22.800 --> 07:24.100
THE PS5 COMES OUT.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.833
I DON'T CARE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE

07:25.900 --> 07:27.333
AN ALIEN'S WAFFLE MAKER OR A

07:27.400 --> 07:28.533
PENGUIN DESIGNED BY APPLE.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.766
IT'S GOING TO HAVE

07:29.833 --> 07:30.733
"HORIZON FORBIDDEN WEST" AS AN

07:30.800 --> 07:32.000
EXCLUSIVE RELEASE, AND I WILL

07:32.066 --> 07:32.700
STOMP ANYONE WHO STANDS BETWEEN

07:32.766 --> 07:33.966
ME AND THAT GAME.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.300
I WANT TO MURDER DINOSAUR ROBOTS

07:35.366 --> 07:36.600
WITH FLAMING ARROWS, AND I WANT

07:36.666 --> 07:38.633
TO DO IT NOW.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.133
NOW, THAT PARTICULAR STAMPEDE

07:40.200 --> 07:41.333
WAS NEARLY A DECADE AGO, BUT

07:41.400 --> 07:42.400
UNFORTUNATELY, THE PROBLEM HAS

07:42.466 --> 07:44.966
ONLY GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THEN.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.600
RENTS HAVE RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY

07:46.666 --> 07:48.033
FASTER THAN INCOMES, TO THE

07:48.100 --> 07:49.366
POINT WHERE, FOR RENTERS BELOW

07:49.433 --> 07:50.800
THE POVERTY LINE, THE MAJORITY

07:50.866 --> 07:53.033
ARE SPENDING MORE THAN HALF OF

07:53.100 --> 07:54.733
THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING AND A

07:54.800 --> 08:00.500
QUARTER ARE PAYING 70% OR MORE.

08:00.566 --> 08:02.266
WHICH IS JUST NOT REMOTELY

08:02.333 --> 08:02.566
SUSTAINABLE.

08:02.633 --> 08:03.400
MEANWHILE, LANDLORDS HAVE BEEN

08:03.466 --> 08:03.966
STEADILY EVICTING AROUND A

08:04.033 --> 08:04.900
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS A YEAR FOR

08:04.966 --> 08:05.600
OVER A DECADE.

08:05.666 --> 08:06.400
AND ALL OF THIS

08:06.466 --> 08:07.266
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

08:07.333 --> 08:08.166
PEOPLE OF COLOR, AS BLACK

08:08.233 --> 08:09.100
HOUSEHOLDS, FOR INSTANCE, ARE

08:09.166 --> 08:10.600
TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITE

08:10.666 --> 08:12.200
HOUSEHOLDS TO FACE EVICTION, AND

08:12.266 --> 08:13.233
WOMEN OF COLOR -- PARTICULARLY

08:13.300 --> 08:14.166
BLACK WOMEN -- ARE ESPECIALLY

08:14.233 --> 08:15.733
VULNERABLE TO IT.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.300
SO THINGS HAVE CLEARLY BEEN BAD

08:17.366 --> 08:19.000
FOR A LONG TIME, BUT ONCE THE

08:19.066 --> 08:19.933
PANDEMIC HIT, LIKE EVERYTHING

08:20.000 --> 08:22.266
ELSE, THEY GOT EVEN WORSE.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.866
AND YET YOU MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED

08:23.933 --> 08:25.600
THERE WAS A FREEZE ON RENT

08:25.666 --> 08:27.233
PAYMENTS IF YOU LISTENED TO

08:27.300 --> 08:28.533
DECOMPOSING MELON LARRY KUDLOW

08:28.600 --> 08:29.666
LAYING OUT THE TRUMP

08:29.733 --> 08:30.833
ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS BACK IN

08:30.900 --> 08:33.300
MARCH:

08:33.366 --> 08:34.533
>> DON'T FORGET ALSO, PLEASE:

08:34.600 --> 08:37.633
REGARDING THINGS LIKE RENT

08:37.700 --> 08:42.666
PAYMENTS OR RENTAL HOME LOANS,

08:42.733 --> 08:44.466
ALL THAT WILL -- EVICTIONS --

08:44.533 --> 08:45.800
LET ME ADD THAT ALL THAT WILL BE

08:45.866 --> 08:46.766
PUT ON HOLD.

08:46.833 --> 08:47.733
THERE WILL BE NO EVICTIONS

08:47.800 --> 08:49.100
DURING THIS PERIOD.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.066
>> John: NOW, THAT SOUNDS GREAT,

08:51.133 --> 08:54.333
ESPECIALLY IF WHAT YOU TOOK FROM

08:54.400 --> 08:55.200
IT WAS, "NO RENT, NO

08:55.266 --> 08:55.866
EVICTIONS."

08:55.933 --> 08:56.733
BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
HE'S SAYING THERE.

08:57.866 --> 08:59.166
THE POLICY HE'S DESCRIBING ONLY

08:59.233 --> 09:01.700
PAUSED EVICTIONS, NOT RENT.

09:01.766 --> 09:03.633
MEANING THAT FOR THOSE UNABLE TO

09:03.700 --> 09:05.133
PAY, THE BILLS THEY OWE HAVE

09:05.200 --> 09:06.266
JUST BEEN PILING UP THIS WHOLE

09:06.333 --> 09:08.200
TIME.

09:08.266 --> 09:09.400
ALSO, THE POLICY ONLY APPLIED TO

09:09.466 --> 09:11.333
CERTAIN PROPERTIES, LIKE THOSE

09:11.400 --> 09:12.500
WITH FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES,

09:12.566 --> 09:13.933
WHICH ACCOUNT FOR JUST A QUARTER

09:14.000 --> 09:15.466
OF ALL RENTAL UNITS.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.233
SO AS FAR AS COMPREHENSIVE PLANS

09:17.300 --> 09:18.266
TO STEM THIS CRISIS, IT LEAVES A

09:18.333 --> 09:20.266
LOT OUT.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.766
MUCH THE SAME WAY, IN FACT, THAT

09:21.833 --> 09:23.000
LARRY KUDLOW'S WIFE LEAVES A LOT

09:23.066 --> 09:24.433
OUT OF HER MANY PAINTINGS OF HER

09:24.500 --> 09:25.700
HUSBAND'S CLOTHES.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.433
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT SHE LEAVES

09:27.500 --> 09:29.133
OUT IS HER HUSBAND.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.166
BECAUSE, AS WE'VE MENTIONED

09:30.233 --> 09:31.633
BEFORE ON THE SHOW, THERE IS

09:31.700 --> 09:32.833
SIMPLY NOTHING SHE LIKES TO DO

09:32.900 --> 09:34.200
MORE THAN PAINT HER HUSBAND'S

09:34.266 --> 09:36.366
TIES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND

09:36.433 --> 09:38.266
OVER AGAIN IN A JOYOUS

09:38.333 --> 09:40.366
CELEBRATION OF THE ABSENCE OF

09:40.433 --> 09:44.166
LARRY KUDLOW.

09:44.233 --> 09:47.200
AND QUICK SIDE NOTE HERE: WHEN

09:47.266 --> 09:48.466
WE FIRST BROUGHT THIS UP MONTHS

09:48.533 --> 09:50.700
AGO, WE OFFERED ANYONE 10 U.S.

09:50.766 --> 09:51.700
DOLLARS, PLUS A $20,000

09:51.766 --> 09:52.566
DONATION TO THEIR LOCAL FOOD

09:52.633 --> 09:54.000
BANK, IF THEY WERE WILLING TO

09:54.066 --> 09:55.033
SELL US ONE OF THESE GENUINE

09:55.100 --> 09:56.100
LARRY-LESS MASTERPIECES.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.533
AND EVERYTHING'S BEEN SO BUSY

09:57.600 --> 09:59.000
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE

09:59.066 --> 10:00.066
TO REVEAL SOMETHING TO YOU.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.433
AND THAT IS...

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
WE ACTUALLY GOT ONE.

10:04.566 --> 10:05.900
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE ABSENCE

10:05.966 --> 10:07.900
OF LARRY IS EVEN MORE STRIKING

10:07.966 --> 10:11.433
IN PERSON.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.600
LOOK, THE POINT IS, THE FEDERAL

10:12.666 --> 10:13.700
MORATORIUM ON EVICTIONS LEFT A

10:13.766 --> 10:16.066
LOT OF PEOPLE UNPROTECTED.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.533
AND WHILE SEVERAL DOZEN STATES

10:17.600 --> 10:18.933
PUT IN PLACE THEIR OWN

10:19.000 --> 10:20.266
MORATORIUMS, MANY OF THOSE

10:20.333 --> 10:23.466
PROTECTIONS HAVE ALREADY

10:23.533 --> 10:25.033
EXPIRED, LEAVING RENTERS IN

10:25.100 --> 10:26.500
23 STATES WITH NO STATE-LEVEL

10:26.566 --> 10:28.533
PROTECTION FROM EVICTION,

10:28.600 --> 10:30.133
MEANING MANY TENANTS ARE FORCED

10:30.200 --> 10:32.233
TO RELY ON THE KINDNESS OF

10:32.300 --> 10:33.600
THEIR LANDLORDS, SOME OF WHOM,

10:33.666 --> 10:35.200
TO THEIR CREDIT, HAVE WORKED

10:35.266 --> 10:37.100
WITH THEIR TENANTS AND REDUCED

10:37.166 --> 10:38.733
THE RENT OWED, OR HAVE STEPPED

10:38.800 --> 10:39.400
UP IN EVEN BIGGER WAYS, LIKE

10:39.466 --> 10:40.100
THIS GUY:

10:40.166 --> 10:41.800
>> MARIO SALERNO OWNS ROUGHLY 80

10:41.866 --> 10:42.600
APARTMENTS IN HIS HOMETOWN OF

10:42.666 --> 10:44.000
WILLIAMSBURG.

10:44.066 --> 10:45.266
HE KNOWS THE PAIN SO MANY ARE

10:45.333 --> 10:47.366
GOING THROUGH.

10:47.433 --> 10:50.500
SO HE DECIDED THIS MONTH TO

10:50.566 --> 10:51.733
WAIVE RENT FOR EVERYONE.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.800
EVERYONE.

10:52.866 --> 10:53.733
200 TENANTS.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.700
AND HE IS NOT COLLECTING.

10:55.766 --> 10:59.233
>> FOR ME, IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT

10:59.300 --> 11:00.500
FOR PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND WORRYING

11:00.566 --> 11:02.266
ABOUT WHO CAN PUT FOOD ON WHOSE

11:02.333 --> 11:06.100
TABLE.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.500
I HAD TENANTS THAT SAID THEY

11:08.566 --> 11:09.066
CAN'T WORK, THEY CAN'T PAY

11:09.133 --> 11:09.700
ME.

11:09.766 --> 11:10.766
I SAYS, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT

11:10.833 --> 11:11.400
PAYING ME.

11:11.466 --> 11:14.400
WORRY ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR."

11:14.466 --> 11:16.500
>> John: THAT'S GREAT.

11:16.566 --> 11:17.133
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

11:17.200 --> 11:17.933
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE SOLUTION

11:18.000 --> 11:18.866
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T BE TO COUNT ON

11:18.933 --> 11:20.000
EVERYONE BEING LIKE THAT GUY, IF

11:20.066 --> 11:21.100
FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN IF

11:21.166 --> 11:22.300
EVERYONE WAS LIKE THAT GUY WE'D

11:22.366 --> 11:23.400
BE FORCED TO MAKE A "SOPRANOS"

11:23.466 --> 11:25.566
REBOOT THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST

11:25.633 --> 11:26.666
"OOPS! ALL SILVIOS."

11:26.733 --> 11:28.166
AND NOBODY WANTS THAT, NOT EVEN

11:28.233 --> 11:29.766
SILVIO.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.066
HE BALKED AT HIS BRIEF TENURE

11:31.133 --> 11:31.866
BEING THE SKIPPER.

11:31.933 --> 11:32.500
HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE CROWN.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.366
LET'S JUST LET HIM STAY WHERE

11:34.433 --> 11:35.500
HE'S COMFORTABLE.

11:35.566 --> 11:36.900
AND THE TRUTH IS, RATHER THAN

11:36.966 --> 11:38.033
EMULATING THAT GUY, SOME

11:38.100 --> 11:39.933
LANDLORDS HAVE GONE THE OPPOSITE

11:40.000 --> 11:40.933
WAY, EVEN TRYING TO THREATEN

11:41.033 --> 11:42.000
TENANTS DESPITE THE PROTECTIONS

11:42.066 --> 11:43.800
IN PLACE.

11:43.866 --> 11:45.966
>> COURTNEY IS STILL IN

11:46.033 --> 11:47.500
DISBELIEF AS SHE READS THROUGH

11:47.566 --> 11:50.633
THE MOST RECENT EMAILS FROM HER

11:50.700 --> 11:51.466
LANDLORD.

11:51.533 --> 11:52.800
SHE SAYS ON MARCH 31ST SHE TOLD

11:52.866 --> 11:54.433
THE LANDLORD WHO LIVES IN CANADA

11:54.500 --> 11:56.133
THAT APRIL RENT WOULD BE LATE.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.233
DAYS LATER...

11:57.300 --> 11:58.466
>> "JUST PAY THE RENT OR MOVE

11:58.533 --> 11:59.000
OUT."

11:59.066 --> 12:00.400
>> THE EMAILS STARTED.

12:00.466 --> 12:01.600
>> "YOU LYING [BLEEP].

12:01.666 --> 12:03.266
BOTH YOU AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER

12:03.333 --> 12:04.200
CAN GO ONLINE AND [BLEEP]

12:04.266 --> 12:05.600
YOURSELVES."

12:05.666 --> 12:07.333
>> John: WOW.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.466
THAT ISN'T JUST HORRIFYING, IT

12:08.533 --> 12:10.100
ALSO EFFECTIVELY DEMOLISHES

12:10.166 --> 12:11.266
EVERY CANADIAN STEREOTYPE I'VE

12:11.333 --> 12:14.900
PREVIOUSLY HELD.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.866
'CAUSE IT SEEMS THERE'S A NEW

12:15.933 --> 12:19.100
TYPE OF CANADIAN NONE OF US HAVE

12:19.166 --> 12:20.600
KNOWN ABOUT, AND IT'S THE

12:20.666 --> 12:21.866
HARD-HEARTED BAD BOY WHO TELLS

12:21.933 --> 12:22.500
YOU AND YOUR GRANDMA TO GO FUCK

12:22.566 --> 12:23.366
YOURSELVES.

12:23.433 --> 12:24.800
NOW, LUCKILY, HER GOVERNOR HAD

12:24.866 --> 12:25.666
ORDERED A FREEZE ON EVICTIONS

12:25.733 --> 12:26.966
FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY COVID,

12:27.033 --> 12:28.766
WHICH COVERED HER SITUATION.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.100
AND WHEN THAT LOCAL NEWS

12:30.166 --> 12:31.566
REPORTER POINTED THAT OUT TO HER

12:31.633 --> 12:32.333
LANDLORD, HIS RESPONSE WAS

12:32.400 --> 12:34.300
PRETTY REMARKABLE.

12:34.366 --> 12:36.433
>> HE SENT US A COLORFUL EMAIL.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.933
IN IT, HE APOLOGIZED FOR THE

12:39.000 --> 12:41.100
PROFANITY AND EVENTUALLY SAID

12:41.166 --> 12:44.300
HE'S WILLING TO WAIVE HER LATE

12:44.366 --> 12:45.033
FEES PLUS HALF THE APRIL RENT

12:45.100 --> 12:46.133
WHICH HE WOULD LOSE ANYWAY IF HE

12:46.200 --> 12:49.133
HAD TO FIND A NEW TENANT.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.300
AND THEY CAN BOTH GET ON WITH

12:51.366 --> 12:52.933
"OUR MISERABLE LIVES."

12:53.000 --> 12:54.866
>> John: OKAY, WHATEVER YOU

12:54.933 --> 12:55.933
THINK OF THAT LANDLORD'S

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
BEHAVIOR, I WILL SAY THIS:

12:59.066 --> 13:00.033
THAT IS JUST OBJECTIVELY THE

13:00.100 --> 13:00.866
RIGHT WAY TO END ANY EMAIL IN

13:00.933 --> 13:02.233
2020.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.333
"HAPPY VIRTUAL GRADUATION!

13:03.400 --> 13:04.733
NOW LET'S GET ON WITH OUR

13:04.800 --> 13:05.533
MISERABLE LIVES."

13:05.600 --> 13:06.933
"CONGRATS ON THE NEW BABY!

13:07.000 --> 13:08.233
NOW LET'S GET ON WITH OUR

13:08.300 --> 13:09.200
MISERABLE LIVES."

13:09.266 --> 13:10.566
"MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES ON THE

13:10.633 --> 13:11.633
LOSS OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.033
SHE LIVED A LONG AND MISERABLE

13:13.100 --> 13:14.300
LIFE, AND NOW SHE'D WANT US TO

13:14.366 --> 13:15.900
GET ON WITH OURS."

13:15.966 --> 13:16.933
AND THE THING IS, EVEN WHEN

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS

13:18.066 --> 13:19.800
OBEYED THE MORATORIUMS, THEY

13:19.866 --> 13:21.200
OFTEN MADE IT PAINFULLY CLEAR

13:21.266 --> 13:22.266
THAT TENANTS WERE GOING TO BE

13:22.333 --> 13:23.466
EVICTED AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE

13:23.533 --> 13:26.000
OPPORTUNITY.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.800
>> I'M NOTORIOUSLY A LANDLORD

13:27.866 --> 13:28.833
THAT DOESN'T GENERALLY LET

13:28.900 --> 13:30.300
TENANTS GET BY WITH ANY

13:30.366 --> 13:31.600
EXCEPTION.

13:31.666 --> 13:33.066
>> EVEN AS COURT HEARINGS ARE

13:33.133 --> 13:34.333
TEMPORARILY ON HOLD, HE'S MOVING

13:34.400 --> 13:35.800
FORWARD WITH FILING EVICTIONS

13:35.866 --> 13:39.000
AND ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT.

13:39.066 --> 13:40.433
>> IT'S NEVER FUN THROWING, YOU

13:40.500 --> 13:43.100
KNOW, THROWING A SINGLE MOTHER

13:43.166 --> 13:44.133
AND THEIR THREE KIDS OUT ON THE

13:44.200 --> 13:44.633
STREETS.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.500
THAT'S NOT FUN.

13:45.566 --> 13:47.100
BUT IT'S BUSINESS.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.333
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL:

13:48.400 --> 13:50.133
NEVER SAY NEVER.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.133
WHAT IF THE THREE KIDS IN

13:53.200 --> 13:54.666
QUESTION WERE BABY HITLER, BABY

13:54.733 --> 13:55.433
STALIN, AND DONALD TRUMP JR.,

13:55.500 --> 13:56.433
AND THEIR SINGLE MOM WAS

13:56.500 --> 13:57.400
GHISLAINE MAXWELL?

13:57.466 --> 13:58.600
THAT'S A PRETTY FUN EVICTION

13:58.666 --> 13:59.833
RIGHT THERE.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.133
THAT FOURSOME COULD FRANKLY USE

14:01.200 --> 14:05.400
A LITTLE TIME ON THE STREET.

14:05.466 --> 14:06.233
BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THAT

14:06.300 --> 14:07.566
EXAMPLE IS ACTUALLY REALLY

14:07.633 --> 14:08.700
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE

14:08.766 --> 14:09.766
MORATORIUMS PREVENT THE PHYSICAL

14:09.833 --> 14:11.466
ACT OF EVICTION, BUT THEY DON'T

14:11.533 --> 14:13.100
STOP THE LEGAL PROCESS THAT

14:13.166 --> 14:18.833
LEADS UP TO IT.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.700
MANY LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY

14:19.766 --> 14:20.733
MANAGERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FILE

14:20.800 --> 14:21.400
FOR EVICTIONS WITH THE COURT

14:21.466 --> 14:26.600
THIS WHOLE TIME, MEANING CASES

14:26.666 --> 14:28.733
HAVE JUST BEEN PILING AND PILING

14:28.800 --> 14:29.300
AND PILING UP.

14:29.366 --> 14:30.366
AND AS SOON AS MORATORIUMS ARE

14:30.433 --> 14:30.900
LIFTED -- WHICH IS ALREADY

14:30.966 --> 14:31.466
HAPPENING IN MANY PLACES --

14:31.533 --> 14:32.533
EVICTIONS COULD COME FAST.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.966
AND SOME LANDLORDS WILL TELL YOU

14:35.033 --> 14:35.733
THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION ISN'T

14:35.800 --> 14:36.700
THEIR FAULT AND THAT THEIR

14:36.766 --> 14:37.466
TENANTS SHOULD'VE SOMEHOW

14:37.533 --> 14:39.366
PREPARED BETTER.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.033
ONE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY

14:41.100 --> 14:42.833
ACTUALLY MADE THAT ARGUMENT TO A

14:42.900 --> 14:44.233
LOCAL DENVER NEWS CREW, WHO THEN

14:44.300 --> 14:45.833
PLAYED THE AUDIO TO ONE OF THE

14:45.900 --> 14:46.966
COMPANY'S TENANTS -- AND JUST

14:47.033 --> 14:49.366
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HIS RESPONSE.

14:49.433 --> 14:51.800
>> I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT

14:51.866 --> 14:53.433
EVERYBODY IS IN A STATE OF FEAR

14:53.500 --> 14:56.833
AND PANIC RIGHT NOW, BUT IT'S

14:56.900 --> 14:57.466
NOT THE PROPERTY OWNERS'

14:57.533 --> 14:59.066
RESPONSIBILITY.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.366
WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR A RAINY DAY.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.633
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR

15:02.700 --> 15:04.666
A RAINY DAY.

15:04.733 --> 15:06.033
>> MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE SAVED FOR

15:06.100 --> 15:07.166
THE RAINY DAY.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.666
JUST SAYIN'.

15:09.733 --> 15:11.966
>> John: YEAH.

15:12.033 --> 15:12.966
THAT'S A FAIR POINT.

15:13.033 --> 15:13.733
BECAUSE WHY ARE RENTERS

15:13.800 --> 15:14.900
CONSISTENTLY THE ONLY ONES BEING

15:14.966 --> 15:15.833
TOLD THEY SHOULD'VE PLANNED

15:15.900 --> 15:17.033
BETTER?

15:17.100 --> 15:18.100
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

15:18.166 --> 15:19.500
EVERYONE IS IN THIS CRISIS

15:19.566 --> 15:21.700
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

15:21.766 --> 15:23.400
AND THIS ISN'T JUST A RAINY DAY,

15:23.466 --> 15:25.766
IT'S THE GREAT FLOOD, AND ONE

15:25.833 --> 15:29.566
REASON NO ONE HAS AN UMBRELLA IS

15:29.633 --> 15:30.500
'CAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE TO REOPEN

15:30.566 --> 15:31.466
THE FUCKING UMBRELLA FACTORY

15:31.533 --> 15:32.633
YET.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.866
AND IN THE FACE OF AN EXTREME

15:33.933 --> 15:35.133
CRISIS, SOME TENANTS ARE

15:35.200 --> 15:36.433
UNDERSTANDABLY CALLING FOR

15:36.500 --> 15:37.533
DRASTIC MEASURES, LIKE RENT

15:37.600 --> 15:39.266
STRIKES.

15:39.333 --> 15:40.933
>> WE ARE OUT HERE TODAY TO

15:41.000 --> 15:41.666
DEMAND THAT THE CITY, THE STATE

15:41.733 --> 15:43.300
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

15:43.366 --> 15:44.566
CANCEL THE RENTS.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.666
WE NEED RENT CANCELLATION.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.400
EVERY MONTH WE'RE ACCUMULATING

15:48.466 --> 15:50.366
MORE AND MORE AND MORE DEBT.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.333
SO THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO

15:51.400 --> 15:53.200
BE ABLE TO REPAY THAT BACK.

15:53.266 --> 15:54.566
>> A LOT OF US ARE ALREADY

15:54.633 --> 15:55.900
CHOOSING BETWEEN FOOD AND RENT.

15:55.966 --> 15:57.500
WE'RE SAYING TO CHOOSE FOOD.

15:57.566 --> 15:59.300
>> THE SAME WAY THEY BAIL OUT

15:59.366 --> 16:01.266
BANKS, THEY SHOULD BAIL OUT

16:01.333 --> 16:02.966
WORKING FAMILIES LIKE MINE.

16:03.033 --> 16:06.866
>> John: YEAH, WE SHOULD TREAT

16:06.933 --> 16:10.300
FAMILIES AT LEAST AS WELL AS WE

16:10.366 --> 16:11.466
TREAT BANKS, WHO CAN APPARENTLY,

16:11.533 --> 16:12.900
LIKE WELLS FARGO, JUST

16:12.966 --> 16:14.166
RE-ESTABLISH THEMSELVES WHENEVER

16:14.233 --> 16:15.533
THEY GET IN TROUBLE.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.266
IN FACT, NEXT TIME YOUR LANDLORD

16:17.333 --> 16:17.833
ASKS YOU FOR YOUR LAST THREE

16:17.900 --> 16:19.600
MONTHS OF RENT, TELL THEM

16:19.666 --> 16:20.100
THEY'RE MISTAKEN.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.133
THAT RENT WAS OWED BY THE

16:21.200 --> 16:22.500
PREVIOUS YOU.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.366
THE CURRENT YOU WAS

16:24.433 --> 16:25.833
RE-ESTABLISHED ON JULY 1, 2020,

16:25.900 --> 16:26.966
AND YOU'RE READY FOR A FRESH

16:27.033 --> 16:28.400
START.

16:28.466 --> 16:29.933
AND LOOK, RENT STRIKES ARE A

16:30.000 --> 16:31.500
RISK.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.333
ULTIMATELY, YOU COULD END UP

16:33.400 --> 16:34.300
BEING EVICTED FOR NON-PAYMENT,

16:34.366 --> 16:35.166
WHICH, REMEMBER, COULD MAKE IT

16:35.233 --> 16:36.000
HARDER TO GET HOUSING IN THE

16:36.066 --> 16:37.200
FUTURE.

16:37.266 --> 16:38.833
AND DEPENDING ON YOUR LANDLORD'S

16:38.900 --> 16:40.366
SITUATION, THEY MIGHT BE UNABLE

16:40.433 --> 16:42.200
TO MEET PROPERTY TAXES THAT GO

16:42.266 --> 16:43.433
TOWARD FUNDING ESSENTIAL CITY

16:43.500 --> 16:48.600
SERVICES.

16:48.666 --> 16:49.166
SO THEY ARE NOT WITHOUT

16:49.233 --> 16:50.166
CONSEQUENCES.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.000
BUT YOU CAN SEE WHY MANY HAVE

16:51.066 --> 16:53.766
BEEN PUSHING FOR THEM, OR,

16:53.833 --> 16:54.966
INDEED, FOR RENT CANCELLATION,

16:55.033 --> 16:55.833
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE.

16:55.900 --> 16:56.900
AND STRIKES HAVE BEEN AN

16:56.966 --> 16:58.100
EFFECTIVE WAY OF CALLING

16:58.166 --> 16:58.900
ATTENTION TO HOW DIRE THINGS ARE

16:58.966 --> 17:00.066
RIGHT NOW.

17:00.133 --> 17:01.266
AND WHILE, LONG-TERM, WE

17:01.333 --> 17:03.066
DESPERATELY NEED A PLAN TO FIX

17:03.133 --> 17:05.133
OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS,

17:05.200 --> 17:06.266
IN THE SHORT TERM, WE JUST HAVE

17:06.333 --> 17:08.100
TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE IN

17:08.166 --> 17:12.666
THEIR HOMES.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.166
AND ALTHOUGH SOME CITIES ARE

17:14.233 --> 17:15.466
TRYING TO PROVIDE RENTAL

17:15.533 --> 17:17.200
ASSISTANCE, THE LIMITED FUNDS AT

17:17.266 --> 17:18.566
THEIR DISPOSAL MAKE IT DIFFICULT

17:18.633 --> 17:19.166
TO ADDRESS THE SCOPE OF THE

17:19.233 --> 17:19.733
PROBLEM.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.133
TAKE HOUSTON: THEY ESTABLISHED A

17:21.200 --> 17:22.033
$15-MILLION RENTAL RELIEF FUND,

17:22.100 --> 17:24.800
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED:

17:24.866 --> 17:28.333
>> $15 MILLION, GONE IN JUST 90

17:28.400 --> 17:28.566
MINUTES.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.600
MONEY THAT WAS DEDICATED TO HELP

17:30.666 --> 17:31.700
FAMILIES PAY THEIR RENT DURING

17:31.766 --> 17:32.933
THIS PANDEMIC.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.466
>> WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT

17:34.533 --> 17:35.600
YOUR APPLICATIONS FOR THE --

17:35.666 --> 17:37.266
>> RITA AND TREVOR HAD APPLIED

17:37.333 --> 17:38.133
FOR 1,800 BUCKS IN RENTAL

17:38.200 --> 17:39.333
ASSISTANCE.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.933
THEY WON'T BE GETTING THAT HELP

17:41.000 --> 17:42.333
THOUGH, BECAUSE BY THE TIME THEY

17:42.400 --> 17:43.466
APPLIED ONLINE THIS MORNING, THE

17:43.533 --> 17:45.200
MONEY WAS ALREADY GONE.

17:45.266 --> 17:47.533
>> $15 MILLION GONE IN AN HOUR?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.200
COME ON NOW.

17:50.266 --> 17:51.733
>> John: YEAH, IT'S SHOCKING TO

17:51.800 --> 17:53.566
WATCH $15 MILLION DISAPPEAR IN

17:53.633 --> 17:56.200
90 MINUTES.

17:56.266 --> 17:57.200
I MEAN, NOT QUITE AS SHOCKING AS

17:57.266 --> 17:58.033
WATCHING $175 MILLION DISAPPEAR

17:58.100 --> 17:59.133
IN AROUND THE SAME TIME, BUT

17:59.200 --> 18:01.300
STILL, YOU KNOW: SHOCKING.

18:01.366 --> 18:03.166
AND THE THING IS, THE CITY OF

18:03.233 --> 18:04.733
HOUSTON KNEW GOING IN THIS WAS

18:04.800 --> 18:05.833
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.600
THEY EVEN TWEETED AFTER THE

18:07.666 --> 18:09.200
FACT, "WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS

18:09.266 --> 18:11.300
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TO MEET THE

18:11.366 --> 18:13.166
NEED OF ALL HOUSTONIANS."

18:13.233 --> 18:14.066
AND IN FACT, THE CITY DIRECTLY

18:14.133 --> 18:15.133
ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO REACH OUT

18:15.200 --> 18:16.400
TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO

18:16.466 --> 18:17.566
ADVOCATE FOR GREATER FUNDING,

18:17.633 --> 18:19.033
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, CITIES CAN

18:19.100 --> 18:20.066
ONLY DO SO MUCH WITHOUT FEDERAL

18:20.133 --> 18:22.066
INTERVENTION.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.200
THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

18:24.266 --> 18:27.933
AMOUNT OF POWER AS THE SERVANTS

18:28.000 --> 18:29.066
OF "DOWNTON ABBEY" -- SURE,

18:29.133 --> 18:29.933
THEY'LL DO WHAT THEY CAN, BUT AT

18:30.000 --> 18:30.833
A CERTAIN POINT, WHEN THINGS GET

18:30.900 --> 18:31.600
REALLY BAD, THEY'RE GOING TO

18:31.666 --> 18:35.833
HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHIT UPSTAIRS.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.200
NOW, IN A MUCH BOLDER MOVE, THE

18:37.266 --> 18:38.100
CITY OF ITHACA, NEW YORK, IS

18:38.166 --> 18:38.700
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

18:38.766 --> 18:39.966
TRYING TO CANCEL RENT FOR THOSE

18:40.033 --> 18:40.866
AFFECTED BY THIS PANDEMIC AND IS

18:40.933 --> 18:41.933
CALLING ON THE STATE TO PROVIDE

18:42.000 --> 18:43.066
FUNDING FOR LANDLORDS WHO NEED

18:43.133 --> 18:47.300
RELIEF.

18:47.366 --> 18:48.533
AND THAT IS AN INTERESTING IDEA,

18:48.600 --> 18:49.200
ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, IT REQUIRES THE

18:49.266 --> 18:50.433
PEOPLE UPSTAIRS, LIKE THE STATE

18:50.500 --> 18:51.033
AND, ULTIMATELY, THE FEDERAL

18:51.100 --> 18:52.733
GOVERNMENT, TO ACT.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.633
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'VE

18:54.700 --> 18:56.166
DRAGGED THEIR FEET ON OFFERING

18:56.233 --> 18:57.233
SOLUTIONS FOR RENTERS THAT

18:57.300 --> 18:58.400
REMOTELY MEET THE SCALE OF THIS

18:58.466 --> 19:03.566
CRISIS.

19:03.633 --> 19:04.566
BACK IN MAY, TO ITS CREDIT, THE

19:04.633 --> 19:05.133
HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACT,

19:05.200 --> 19:06.066
WHICH PROVIDED $100 BILLION IN

19:06.133 --> 19:07.500
RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE MOST

19:07.566 --> 19:10.866
VULNERABLE.

19:10.933 --> 19:11.500
UNFORTUNATELY, SINCE THEN, THE

19:11.566 --> 19:12.766
BILL HAS STALLED OUT IN THE

19:12.833 --> 19:13.766
SENATE -- WHICH IS NO SURPRISE,

19:13.833 --> 19:14.600
AS MULTIPLE HIGH-LEVEL

19:14.666 --> 19:16.033
REPUBLICANS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR

19:16.100 --> 19:17.033
RETICENCE TO PASS ANOTHER RELIEF

19:17.100 --> 19:21.733
PACKAGE.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.966
>> I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD

19:23.033 --> 19:24.966
LIKE TO JUST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT

19:25.033 --> 19:27.266
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

19:27.333 --> 19:29.866
IMPACT OF THIS MASSIVE

19:29.933 --> 19:35.566
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.266
>> IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES THE

19:36.333 --> 19:37.433
MOMENTUM THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO

19:37.500 --> 19:38.000
SEE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

19:38.066 --> 19:38.966
WEEKS OF DATA, THEN I THINK ONE

19:39.033 --> 19:39.633
MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT THE STIMULUS

19:39.700 --> 19:40.466
THAT WE'VE ALREADY PASSED IS

19:40.533 --> 19:42.066
ENOUGH.

19:42.133 --> 19:43.233
>> WE NEED TO ASSESS WHAT WE'VE

19:43.300 --> 19:45.133
ALREADY DONE, TAKE A LOOK AT

19:45.200 --> 19:47.933
WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DIDN'T, AND

19:48.000 --> 19:52.166
WE'LL DISCUSS THE WAY FORWARD IN

19:52.233 --> 19:53.933
THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.666
>> John: OH, A COUPLE OF WEEKS?

20:02.733 --> 20:03.266
REALLY?

20:03.333 --> 20:04.866
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

20:04.933 --> 20:05.566
THAT WAS BACK IN MAY.

20:05.633 --> 20:06.433
WE'RE NOW AT THE END OF JUNE,

20:06.500 --> 20:07.300
NOTHING'S BEEN PASSED, AND RENT

20:07.366 --> 20:07.933
IS DUE ON FUCKING WEDNESDAY.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.666
THAT SAID, I KNOW THAT TIME DOES

20:08.733 --> 20:12.000
NOT FUNCTION THE SAME WAY FOR

20:12.066 --> 20:12.800
MITCH McCONNELL AS IT DOES FOR

20:12.866 --> 20:13.400
EVERYONE ELSE.

20:13.466 --> 20:14.233
FOR INSTANCE, FOR US, TODAY IS

20:14.300 --> 20:15.233
JUNE 28TH, BUT FOR HIM -- BASED

20:15.300 --> 20:15.900
ON THE WAY GENERALLY THINKS,

20:15.966 --> 20:16.666
SPEAKS, AND BEHAVES -- THE

20:16.733 --> 20:17.666
CURRENT DATE IS SOMEWHERE AROUND

20:17.733 --> 20:18.900
MAY 12TH, 1853.

20:18.966 --> 20:20.300
AND LOOK, THE SAD TRUTH IS,

20:20.366 --> 20:21.366
WE'VE ALREADY WAITED TOO LONG

20:21.433 --> 20:22.833
HERE.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.833
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

20:23.900 --> 20:25.200
EXCUSE FOR NOT ATTACKING THIS

20:25.266 --> 20:27.300
PROBLEM WITH REAL URGENCY,

20:27.366 --> 20:28.500
BECAUSE WHILE WE WAIT FOR

20:28.566 --> 20:30.466
CONGRESS TO ACT, PEOPLE LIKE

20:30.533 --> 20:31.766
THIS WOMAN ARE HAVING TO DEAL

20:31.833 --> 20:33.966
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.266
>> KIANAH ASHLEY IS BEING

20:35.333 --> 20:37.500
EVICTED, AND A NIGHTMARE IS

20:37.566 --> 20:39.166
UNFOLDING FOR HER AND HER

20:39.233 --> 20:40.333
FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON, NAZIR.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.133
>> THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULDN'T

20:42.200 --> 20:44.466
WISH ON MY WORST ENEMY, BECAUSE

20:44.533 --> 20:45.300
NOT KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE GOING

20:45.366 --> 20:46.766
TO REST YOUR HEAD AT FOR THE

20:46.833 --> 20:50.966
NEXT DAY, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

20:51.033 --> 20:52.400
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE IT'S

20:52.466 --> 20:53.733
NOT GOOD.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.466
EVERYONE DESERVES THE BASIC

20:56.533 --> 21:00.466
STABILITY OF SHELTER.

21:00.533 --> 21:01.400
AND IF YOU ARE IN A POSITION

21:01.466 --> 21:03.666
WHERE YOU HAVE BEGUN TO

21:03.733 --> 21:05.300
DESPISE THE HOUSE YOU'VE BEEN

21:05.366 --> 21:05.900
SHUT INSIDE FOR THE LAST THREE

21:05.966 --> 21:06.566
AND A HALF MONTHS, THE ONLY

21:06.633 --> 21:07.566
THING WORSE THAN KNOWING YOU'RE

21:07.633 --> 21:08.233
GOING TO SPEND ANOTHER DAY STUCK

21:08.300 --> 21:08.833
UNDER THE SAME ROOF IS NOT

21:08.900 --> 21:10.066
KNOWING THAT.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.366
AND WHILE THERE ARE CLEARLY NO

21:11.433 --> 21:13.133
PERFECT OPTIONS HERE, THE VERY

21:13.200 --> 21:14.466
WORST THING THAT WE COULD DO

21:14.533 --> 21:17.400
RIGHT NOW IS NOTHING, BECAUSE

21:17.466 --> 21:21.800
EVERY DAY WE FAIL TO ACT IS A

21:21.866 --> 21:22.933
DAY WE'RE COMPOUNDING ANOTHER

21:23.000 --> 21:23.533
FUTURE CRISIS FOR MILLIONS OF

21:23.600 --> 21:24.266
VULNERABLE RENTERS AND THEIR

21:24.333 --> 21:25.233
COMMUNITIES.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.500
WE NEED TO STOP THIS BEFORE IT

21:26.566 --> 21:28.400
GETS EVEN WORSE, AND IN THE

21:28.466 --> 21:29.933
LONGER TERM, WE BADLY NEED TO

21:30.000 --> 21:31.800
SOLVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

21:31.866 --> 21:33.366
CRISIS.

21:33.433 --> 21:35.966
BECAUSE THEN, AND ONLY THEN, TO

21:36.033 --> 21:37.200
QUOTE THE WORLD'S RUDEST

21:37.266 --> 21:38.466
CANADIAN, CAN WE ALL GET ON WITH

OUR MISERABLE LIVES.

21:40.333 --> 21:45.433
AND NOW THIS.

21:45.500 --> 21:45.700
SPEAK

21:45.766 --> 21:50.033
TO T >> Announcer: AND NOW, AT

21:50.100 --> 21:51.300
THE CITIZENS OF PALM BEACH,

FLORIDA, HAVE THOUGHTS ON

21:52.666 --> 21:53.100
MANDATORY FACE MASKS.

21:53.166 --> 21:54.200
SPEAK OUT MY NAME IS BUTCH AND I

21:54.266 --> 21:57.266
AM AN

21:57.333 --> 21:57.900
AMERICAN PATRIOT.

SEE THAT FIGHT, I WOULD DIE FOR

21:59.233 --> 22:00.400
THAT LIKE.

22:00.466 --> 22:03.366
>> THERE IS SO MUCH EVIDENCE,

22:03.433 --> 22:04.966
THE CDC SAID IT MADE A MISTAKE

22:05.033 --> 22:05.900
RIGHT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TO

22:05.966 --> 22:07.433
MAKE THIS A PANDEMIC.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.200
THIS IS A PLANDEMIC.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.033
>> YOU CANNOT MANDATE SOMEBODY

22:11.100 --> 22:13.033
TO WEAR A MASK KNOWING THAT MASK

22:13.100 --> 22:13.766
IS KILLING PEOPLE.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.233
>> OUR AMAZON PRIME DRIVER IT

22:15.300 --> 22:16.666
WAS SO WEAK FROM WEARING HIS

22:16.733 --> 22:19.333
MASK HE BEGGED MY HUSBAND FOR

22:19.400 --> 22:20.233
ADVIL AND WATER.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.733
HE SAID THIS MASK IS KILLING ME.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.700
>> AND THEY WANT TO THROW GOD'S

22:24.766 --> 22:26.233
WONDERFUL BREATHING SYSTEM OUT

THE DOOR PICKED SPEAK

22:27.566 --> 22:28.600
WE HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED.

22:28.666 --> 22:31.133
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO GET

22:31.200 --> 22:32.300
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST EVERYWHERE

22:32.366 --> 22:33.800
I GO ANY MORE THAN THE ELDERLY

22:34.033 --> 22:37.600

22:37.666 --> 22:39.033
WHO LIVED IN GERMANY.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.033
I KNOW A LOT OF STORIES.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.066
AND THIS IS SOUNDING VERY THE

22:42.133 --> 22:42.366
MAYOR TO ME.

22:42.433 --> 22:46.700
>> HOW WILL YOUNG CHILDREN KNOW

22:46.766 --> 22:48.333
WHO THE DANGEROUS DEVIANCE ARE?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.666
>> THIS IS OUR RIGHT TO NOT WEAR

22:50.733 --> 22:52.566
ANYTHING TO COVER OUR FACES.

22:52.633 --> 22:55.866
>> I WOULD DIE FOR THAT COUNTRY!

22:55.933 --> 22:57.500
I WOULD DIE FOR THE

22:57.566 --> 22:58.033
CONSTITUTION!

YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:00.966 --> 23:01.266
YOU DISGRACE ME.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.700
DESPITE WHAT YOU DO APPEAR

23:04.766 --> 23:06.066
TODAY, I'M NOT WEARING ONE

23:06.133 --> 23:06.433

I WILL STAY PREPARED MY RIGHTS

23:09.033 --> 23:10.266
COME FROM GOD, NOT FROM YOU.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.033

23:12.100 --> 23:13.866
DOWN AND PUT IT ON ME.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.333
>> I DON'T WEAR A MASK FOR THE

23:15.400 --> 23:17.800
SAME INSTANT I DON'T WEAR

23:17.866 --> 23:18.066

FINALLY TONIGHT, ANOTHER QUICK

23:27.400 --> 23:28.300
LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT PLACE

23:37.966 --> 23:38.666
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER LAST WEEK, WE

23:38.733 --> 23:39.300
TALKED ABOUT HOW K-POP FANS HAVE

23:39.366 --> 23:39.900

A STATEMENT ENTRYWAY PIECE.

25:14.933 --> 25:16.300
AND NOT TO BE PEDANTIC, BUT WE

25:16.366 --> 25:20.600
LOOKED INTO IT, AND THAT'S NOT

25:20.666 --> 25:21.333
ACTUALLY HOW EAGLES MATE.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.033
WHILE COURTSHIP DISPLAYS TAKE

HAVE A PARTICULARLY NUANCED

25:36.533 --> 25:38.066
UNDERSTANDING OF EAGLE FUCKING.

>> THIS IS THE BISHOP'S CHAIR

25:50.733 --> 25:52.466

WE THINK THAT'S ABOUT 400 OR 500

25:53.166 --> 25:55.733
YEARS OLD.

25:55.800 --> 26:00.100
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE SAYINGS,

26:05.433 --> 26:06.500
IT SEEMS PAPA JOHN PRINTED OUT

26:06.566 --> 26:07.666
HIS FAVORITE SAYING, FRAMED IT,

26:07.733 --> 26:08.666
AND THEN PLACED IT IN THE MIDDLE

26:08.733 --> 26:09.566
OF A DESK WHERE IT LOOKS LESS

26:09.633 --> 26:10.800
LIKE WORDS OF INSPIRATION AND

26:10.866 --> 26:12.066
MORE LIKE THE WIFI PASSWORD AT A

26:12.133 --> 26:14.066
COFFEE SHOP.

26:14.133 --> 26:16.200
AND FOR THE RECORD, THAT QUOTE

26:16.266 --> 26:17.933
IS BY POLISH NOBEL PRIZE WINNER

26:18.000 --> 26:19.100
WISLAWA SZYMBORSKA WHO WAS

26:19.166 --> 26:20.533
COMMENTING ON THE EXCESSES OF

26:20.600 --> 26:22.566
POSTMODERN LITERATURE.

26:22.633 --> 26:24.900

26:26.233 --> 26:27.400

CHAIR IN YOUR 40,000-SQUARE-FOOT

26:33.066 --> 26:34.766

26:34.833 --> 26:36.200
THE INCONGRUITY OF THINKING THAT

26:36.266 --> 26:37.333
SHOWING PEOPLE THIS IN THE MIDST

26:37.400 --> 26:39.333
OF A HISTORIC ECONOMIC COLLAPSE

26:39.400 --> 26:41.766
WOULD BE GOOD PR FOR YOU.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.300
BECAUSE, TO BE CLEAR,

26:43.366 --> 26:44.566
PAPA JOHN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL MEDIA

26:44.633 --> 26:46.133
PRESENCE IS PART OF A CONCERTED

26:46.200 --> 26:48.500
PR CAMPAIGN TO REPAIR HIS IMAGE,

26:48.566 --> 26:50.566
AN IMAGE THAT NEEDS QUITE A LOT

26:50.633 --> 26:52.100
OF REPAIRING.

26:52.166 --> 26:54.733
JUST TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY,

26:54.800 --> 26:56.066
PAPA JOHN ACTUALLY HAD TO LEAVE

26:56.133 --> 26:59.900
HIS COMPANY FOLLOWING A SERIES

26:59.966 --> 27:00.566
OF CONTROVERSIES AND SCANDALS,

27:00.633 --> 27:01.533
FROM HIS 2017 COMMENTS THAT HIS

27:01.600 --> 27:02.666
COMPANY'S SALES HAD BEEN HURT BY

27:02.733 --> 27:03.333
NFL LEADERSHIP NOT CLAMPING DOWN

27:03.400 --> 27:05.733
HARD ENOUGH ON PLAYERS

27:05.800 --> 27:06.466
PROTESTING POLICE BRUTALITY TO

27:06.533 --> 27:08.433
THIS:

27:08.500 --> 27:09.766
>> FOUNDER AND FACE OF

27:09.833 --> 27:11.833
PAPA JOHN'S PIZZA IS APOLOGIZING

27:11.900 --> 27:13.433
AND ADMITTING THAT A REPORT HE

27:13.500 --> 27:14.900
USED THE N-WORD ON A CONFERENCE

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
CALL BACK IN MAY IS TRUE.

27:16.066 --> 27:17.066
>> John: YEAH.

27:17.133 --> 27:18.533
HE APPARENTLY USED THE N-WORD ON

27:18.600 --> 27:19.766
A CONFERENCE CALL.

27:19.833 --> 27:24.066
AND NOT JUST ANY

27:24.133 --> 27:26.700
CONFERENCE CALL EITHER -- DURING

27:26.766 --> 27:27.966
A ROLE-PLAYING EXERCISE FOCUSED

27:28.033 --> 27:28.533
ON AVERTING PUBLIC RELATIONS

27:28.600 --> 27:29.000
CRISES.

27:29.066 --> 27:29.766
WHICH, IN TERMS OF CONTEXTS IN

27:29.833 --> 27:31.000
WHICH TO SAY THAT WORD, IS FAR

27:31.066 --> 27:32.233
AND AWAY THE WORST, TIED ONLY

27:32.300 --> 27:35.800
WITH EVERY OTHER CONTEXT.

27:35.866 --> 27:37.300
NOW, EVER SINCE, PAPA JOHN HAS

27:37.366 --> 27:38.700
TRIED TO OFFER EXPLANATIONS FOR

27:38.766 --> 27:40.166
HIS BEHAVIOR, ARGUING THE

27:40.233 --> 27:41.466
CONFERENCE CALL WAS LEAKED AS A

27:41.533 --> 27:42.833
PART OF A CONSPIRACY TO REMOVE

27:42.900 --> 27:44.100
HIM FROM HIS COMPANY AND THAT HE

27:44.166 --> 27:45.366
ONLY USED THAT SLUR IN THE

27:45.433 --> 27:46.733
COURSE OF EXPLAINING THAT HE

27:46.800 --> 27:47.466
DOESN'T USE IT.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.733
AND THAT'S AN ARGUMENT HE'S

27:48.800 --> 27:49.533
TRIED TO MAKE REPEATEDLY, LIKE

27:49.600 --> 27:50.800
IN THIS INTERVIEW, WHERE HE

27:50.866 --> 27:52.533
ATTEMPTS TO PROVE HE'S NOT A FAN

27:52.600 --> 27:53.666
OF THE N-WORD IN THE WEIRDEST

27:53.733 --> 27:56.033
IMAGINABLE WAY:

27:56.100 --> 27:57.266
>> IF I GO TO DINNER AND SOMEONE

27:57.333 --> 27:58.633
USES THAT WORD -- ONE TIME --

27:58.700 --> 27:59.666
DON'T SAY THE WORD.

27:59.733 --> 28:00.333
AND I'LL GET UP AND LEAVE

28:00.400 --> 28:01.333
DINNER.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.200
I REALLY WILL.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.266
AND I'VE DONE THAT MORE THAN

28:03.333 --> 28:03.966
ONCE.

28:04.033 --> 28:04.966
BUT, UM, IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD

28:05.033 --> 28:07.233
WORD.

28:07.300 --> 28:08.966
>> John: YEAH, NOTHING SAYS

28:09.033 --> 28:10.000
"I'M NOT A RACIST" LIKE

28:10.066 --> 28:11.466
REPEATEDLY MAKING DINNER PLANS

28:11.533 --> 28:13.100
WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT SAY THE

28:13.166 --> 28:14.500
N-WORD AND THEN LEAVING ONCE

28:14.566 --> 28:15.333
THEY DO, IN FACT, SAY IT.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.666
I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS A

28:16.733 --> 28:18.233
MORE REPULSIVE TYPE OF

28:18.300 --> 28:23.033
PAPA JOHN'S DINNER THAN THIS

28:23.100 --> 28:24.200
KIND, BUT IT DOES TURN OUT I WAS

28:24.266 --> 28:25.333
WRONG.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.366
AND NOW, BY HIS OWN ADMISSION,

28:26.433 --> 28:27.000
HE'S POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AT

28:27.066 --> 28:28.666
THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BRAND-NEW

28:28.733 --> 28:30.233
PR TEAM, AND ONE OF THE THINGS

28:30.300 --> 28:31.766
HE'S DOING IS TRYING TO TAKE

28:31.833 --> 28:32.800
OWNERSHIP OF SOME OF THE JOKES

28:32.866 --> 28:34.433
THAT ARE MADE AT HIS EXPENSE.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.700
FOR INSTANCE, THAT INTERVIEW YOU

28:35.766 --> 28:37.266
JUST SAW WAS HIM APPEARING ON A

28:37.333 --> 28:39.433
PODCAST WHOSE HOST HAS MADE FUN

28:39.500 --> 28:40.933
OF HIM FOR YEARS, MOCKING HIM

28:41.000 --> 28:44.033
WITH THE PHRASE "PAPA BLESS,"

28:44.100 --> 28:44.933
WHICH HE IS NOW TRYING TO

28:45.000 --> 28:46.400
RECLAIM, EVEN SELLING T-SHIRTS

28:46.466 --> 28:47.666
WITH THE PHRASE ON IT, AND ALSO

28:47.733 --> 28:48.333
RELEASING THIRSTY ONLINE CONTENT

28:48.400 --> 28:49.600
LIKE THIS:

28:49.666 --> 28:51.600
>> PAPA BLESS?

28:51.666 --> 28:52.666
OR PAPA FLEX?

28:52.733 --> 28:53.600
[CHUCKLES]

28:53.666 --> 28:57.600
>> John: I HATE THAT.

28:57.666 --> 28:58.233
SO MUCH.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.333
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, THERE'S

28:59.400 --> 29:00.000
SOMETHING FRANKLY INSULTING

29:00.066 --> 29:00.966
ABOUT HIM THINKING EVERYONE IS

29:01.033 --> 29:02.500
GOING TO BE HAPPY TO FORGET HIS

29:02.566 --> 29:03.366
PAST JUST BECAUSE HE'S DOING

29:03.433 --> 29:04.300
SOME WACKY THINGS ON THE

29:04.366 --> 29:08.633
INTERNET.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.866
AND THAT WHY IT'S BEEN

29:10.933 --> 29:11.866
REASSURING TO SEE HOW SOME

29:11.933 --> 29:12.466
RESPONDED.

29:12.533 --> 29:13.166
BECAUSE IF YOU CLICK TO SEE IF

29:13.233 --> 29:13.866
ANYONE'S REACTED TO THAT TIKTOK,

29:13.933 --> 29:15.100
YOU'LL SEE PLENTY OF PEOPLE

29:15.166 --> 29:17.200
MAKING DISAPPROVING FACES OR

29:17.266 --> 29:19.500
MOCKING HIM, OR, IN MY FAVORITE

29:19.566 --> 29:21.300
EXAMPLE, THIS MAN CAPTIONING HIS

29:21.366 --> 29:23.200
DISAPPROVAL WITH, "GET OFF MY

29:23.266 --> 29:24.500
FEED, LITTLE RACIST PIZZA MAN,

29:24.566 --> 29:25.866
YOUR HOME IS UGLY AND YOU HAVE

29:25.933 --> 29:26.933
BAD TASTE."

29:27.000 --> 29:32.033
WHICH IS EXCELLENT.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.166
AND TO THAT MAN, I SAY, KUDOS

29:34.233 --> 29:36.133
FOR DOING IN TEN SECONDS WHAT

29:36.200 --> 29:36.900
HAS TAKEN ME FIVE MINUTES TO

29:36.966 --> 29:37.433
DO.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.200
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:38.266 --> 29:40.833
WE'RE OFF FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

29:40.900 --> 29:42.833
WE'LL BE BACK ON JULY 19TH.

29:42.900 --> 29:43.866
UNTIL THEN GOOD NIGHT!

29:43.933 --> 29:47.466
>> PAPA BLESS?

29:47.533 --> 29:49.633
>> John: NO.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.500
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

29:53.566 --> 29:54.566
NOT BEING FUN RIGHT NOW.
