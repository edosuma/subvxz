Your last name, Boldieu,

10:02.169 --> 10:03.747
there's a French finance minister.

10:03.806 --> 10:04.944
That's my father.

10:04.974 --> 10:06.804
He hired Frank to come and get me.

10:07.479 --> 10:09.990
I used to be an intel officer of the DGSE.

10:25.565 --> 10:26.698
You have an offer for me?

10:26.932 --> 10:28.295
Came in last night.

10:29.093 --> 10:31.853
Bernardo Marrone was a
criminal court judge in Rome.

10:31.973 --> 10:34.020
He was hearing a case
against Roberto Rocco,

10:34.140 --> 10:35.716
a Sicilian crime boss.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.550
There's been threats, but
Bernardo refused protection.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.954
This was all over the news,

10:39.964 --> 10:41.927
first Mafia hit on a judge in 20 years.

10:42.047 --> 10:43.507
His son witnessed the crime.

10:43.681 --> 10:44.943
Luca Marrone.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.290
He's been in hiding with his mother, Laura.

10:47.653 --> 10:49.229
And there's been an arrest:

10:49.618 --> 10:50.810
Deszu Magyar,

10:50.857 --> 10:52.247
a contract killer.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.110
The boy's word is the
only evidence against him.

10:54.270 --> 10:56.175
And I'm supposed to drive him to the court?

10:56.295 --> 10:57.724
He's in a secret location and

10:57.743 --> 10:59.475
needs to testify on Monday morning.

10:59.503 --> 11:00.756
Why not call the cops?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.563
Or jump on a plane?

11:02.840 --> 11:05.113
Too many corrupt elements in the police.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.717
And if he got on a flight,
it would alert border patrol.

11:07.939 --> 11:09.266
Where is this secret location?

11:09.769 --> 11:11.642
His uncle's summer home.

11:11.862 --> 11:13.482
Oh, I've seen that place.

11:22.821 --> 11:24.309
Your assessment?

11:25.022 --> 11:26.285
I think you should pass.

11:27.266 --> 11:28.458
What for?

11:28.578 --> 11:31.739
You'd be a sitting duck for
any corrupt cop looking at you.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.654
If they check CCTV.

11:33.774 --> 11:35.194
And they won't know my plate number,

11:35.218 --> 11:36.566
or where I'm coming from.

11:36.809 --> 11:38.706
You hired me to assess risk.

11:38.826 --> 11:40.767
To assess it, not extinguish it.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.723
My assessment: the risk is too high.

11:42.905 --> 11:43.878
I don't think so.

11:44.310 --> 11:44.974
Frank...

11:45.475 --> 11:46.586

11:46.601 --> 11:48.230
that boy needs to be in Rome on Monday.

11:48.557 --> 11:49.378
Your point?

11:49.578 --> 11:51.106
The bad guys will know you're coming.

11:51.514 --> 11:52.927
And I will know they're waiting.

11:54.985 --> 11:56.482
Leave hard copies of the map,

11:56.505 --> 11:58.063
so I'll pick up the boy in the morning.

11:58.964 --> 12:00.488
Don't be discouraged.

12:01.157 --> 12:03.159
I didn't take this job to be ignored.

12:03.279 --> 12:04.492

How am I doing?

15:36.566 --> 15:37.788
Not too good.

15:40.463 --> 15:42.577
That's your car, right?

15:52.780 --> 15:54.142
What did you tell him?

15:54.855 --> 15:56.526
I told him he could drive my car.

16:08.965 --> 16:10.133
Good morning, gentlemen.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.109
How can I help?

16:13.115 --> 16:15.077
Which one is fastest?

16:16.715 --> 16:18.038
Well, they all are fast.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.179
I mean,

16:19.299 --> 16:21.235
these things zoom!

16:23.324 --> 16:26.004
But fastest will be...

16:26.182 --> 16:27.126
This one!

16:29.182 --> 16:30.510
We will take three.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.552
Okay.

16:33.763 --> 16:34.714
Janine!

16:34.731 --> 16:37.312
Can you pull out keys for
the test drive, please?

16:41.180 --> 16:41.926
Hello.

16:42.114 --> 16:42.931
Thank you.

16:45.033 --> 16:46.737
No need for a test drive.

16:48.502 --> 16:49.760
I will take these.

16:54.731 --> 16:56.216
Where are the other two?

16:56.764 --> 16:57.717
Right outside.

17:04.270 --> 17:06.678
You have a security camera here?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.185
Wish we had.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.502
Never lie to a man with a gun.

17:41.587 --> 17:42.934
Can we go faster?

17:45.046 --> 17:46.351
This is fast enough.

17:46.821 --> 17:48.458
We don't want to attract attention.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.528
How long have you been driving?

17:51.467 --> 17:53.072
Since I was about your age.

17:53.546 --> 17:54.964
Since you were twelve?

17:55.694 --> 17:57.474
That's what some boys did where I grew up.

17:57.479 --> 17:59.202
They stole cars and drove them fast.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.220
You stole cars?

18:03.445 --> 18:06.144
I don't think this conversation
is appropriate, do you?

18:15.513 --> 18:17.334
<i>[Car motor accelerating]</i>

18:21.032 --> 18:23.028
So much for not attracting attention.

18:32.087 --> 18:33.486
Isn't this thing bulletproof?

Armour-piercing rounds.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.588

<i>[People screaming, tires screaching]</i>

20:01.377 --> 20:02.415

20:41.084 --> 20:42.253
Okay...

20:42.670 --> 20:44.325
Go with your mom, okay?

20:44.559 --> 20:45.675
I'll be right up.

20:49.931 --> 20:50.899
Shit...

20:57.118 --> 20:58.766
Are you talking to the car?

20:59.813 --> 21:01.094
Of course not.

21:02.005 --> 21:03.178
Tungsten carbide.

21:04.018 --> 21:05.769
One shot would take your head off.

21:06.113 --> 21:07.186
How long to fix it?

21:08.791 --> 21:10.575
- 30 minutes.
- Make it 20.

21:12.232 --> 21:13.823
You're still in Germany, Frank.

21:14.644 --> 21:15.662
I noticed.

21:15.892 --> 21:17.915
No Italian cop told them where you were.

21:18.896 --> 21:20.923
So how did they find you?

21:21.125 --> 21:22.609
An implant in the boy's neck.

21:22.843 --> 21:23.932
Are you serious?

21:24.131 --> 21:25.495
No, I'm not serious.

21:25.537 --> 21:27.299
I have no idea, but I'll find out.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.401
Cat was right, you know.

21:29.602 --> 21:30.643
About the risk.

21:43.216 --> 21:44.549
Are you okay?

21:44.948 --> 21:47.755
A little scary, wasn't it, getting shot at?

21:49.506 --> 21:50.651
Kind of cool, too.

21:54.035 --> 21:55.866
His name is Aleksander Magyar.

21:58.959 --> 21:59.870
Magyar.

22:02.531 --> 22:03.878
Brother of Deszu.

22:03.944 --> 22:06.976
We think he shot 2 people dead
in a car dealership this morning.

22:07.009 --> 22:09.548
So now both brothers are
working for the Mafia?

22:10.449 --> 22:12.805
How did this madman find my nephew?

22:12.844 --> 22:14.119
I hoped you might know.

22:14.706 --> 22:17.339
The attack happened only minutes
after Frank left your estate.

22:17.395 --> 22:19.189
They followed your transporter here.

22:19.363 --> 22:21.118
Frank doesn't make mistakes like that.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.794
Of course you'd say that.

22:22.972 --> 22:25.108
I suppose he doesn't give refunds either.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.816
He will get your nephew
to Rome, Mr. Marrone.

22:30.764 --> 22:31.496
No.

22:32.224 --> 22:33.979
I'm not letting Luca testify.

22:34.364 --> 22:35.518
Martino...

22:36.234 --> 22:38.231
I want justice for my brother,

22:39.259 --> 22:41.052
but not at the cost of that boy's life.

22:59.757 --> 23:01.915
<i>[Mysterious music comes up]</i>

23:09.014 --> 23:10.445
Frank Martin.

23:12.055 --> 23:15.111
My brother thought of
hiring you for a job once.

23:16.547 --> 23:18.865
You want the job, Frank?

23:19.100 --> 23:19.789
No...

23:20.133 --> 23:21.307
thank you.

23:22.564 --> 23:24.079
I already have one.

23:24.199 --> 23:25.953
You should not have taken it, Frank.

23:26.620 --> 23:27.981
He's just a boy.

23:28.277 --> 23:30.501
I have nothing against you, Frank.

23:31.707 --> 23:32.712
Leave now.

23:33.557 --> 23:34.439
You can live.

23:35.683 --> 23:36.729

we've got trouble.

Tell me about it. I've got
to get them out of here.

25:33.610 --> 25:35.239
They're watching your car.

26:30.568 --> 26:32.661
He said you have to take us back to Munich.

26:32.732 --> 26:33.675
What?

26:33.722 --> 26:35.572
He's decided it's too dangerous, Luca.

26:35.590 --> 26:36.994
He doesn't want you to testify.

26:37.322 --> 26:38.594
But I said I would.

26:38.660 --> 26:40.336
Well, it's not your decision, honey.

26:40.364 --> 26:42.139
It's not his either, he's not my father.

26:42.157 --> 26:43.303
Well, I'm your mother!

She won't listen to me.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.744
You must understand.

27:40.791 --> 27:44.038
Martino and Bernardo had a
falling out over that woman.

27:44.639 --> 27:45.362
Why?

27:53.848 --> 27:54.575
Cat?

27:57.532 --> 27:59.619
I didn't know French

27:59.739 --> 28:01.193

that wasn't in the news.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.496
Her marriage was over.

28:12.934 --> 28:13.697
Says who?

28:14.201 --> 28:15.185
Sofia.

28:15.377 --> 28:17.517
She said Bernardo wanted a divorce.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.546
<i>And it seems there was some infidelity.</i>

28:19.912 --> 28:21.324
You think she had him killed?

28:21.743 --> 28:23.958
She couldn't know Luca would witness it.

28:24.339 --> 28:26.132
They shot at her today too.

28:26.578 --> 28:28.339
Magyar needs to save his brother.

28:28.391 --> 28:29.939
Doesn't matter who hired him.

28:30.296 --> 28:33.637
That still doesn't explain
how they found us today, twice.

28:46.874 --> 28:49.413
I want to thank you for
what you said back there.

28:49.643 --> 28:50.836
What did I say?

28:51.864 --> 28:53.577
You asked what I wanted.

28:54.694 --> 28:57.449
And I realized no one asked
me that in a long time.

28:57.651 --> 28:59.730
Bernardo made all the decisions?

29:00.580 --> 29:01.500
Yes.

29:01.983 --> 29:03.714
Like deciding to divorce you?

29:05.274 --> 29:06.794
Is that what you heard?

29:07.893 --> 29:10.727
It could be considered a
motive for murder, Mrs. Marrone.

29:11.065 --> 29:13.230
The Mafia ordered my husband's death.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.938
The Mafia didn't tell those
men where to find us today.

29:16.361 --> 29:17.369
Then who did?

29:17.449 --> 29:19.862
It had to be someone close
to your family, or in it.

29:20.073 --> 29:22.382
You think I'd do this to my own son?

29:22.645 --> 29:25.113

been through these past weeks?

29:28.066 --> 29:29.399
Did you love your husband?

29:31.210 --> 29:33.674
Bernardo found me in a village in Croatia.

29:34.317 --> 29:36.176
He saved me from a life of poverty.

29:37.213 --> 29:39.954
I wasn't in love with him, no.

29:40.837 --> 29:42.217
And he knew that, but

29:42.337 --> 29:45.333
he was the father of my son
and I was faithful to him.

29:47.596 --> 29:49.075
I would never hurt him.

29:50.727 --> 29:51.657
Never.

30:31.186 --> 30:33.186
He tried to kill the boy twice today.

30:33.524 --> 30:35.791
Is that what you came here to tell me?

30:36.011 --> 30:38.602
I came here to give you one last chance,

30:38.795 --> 30:40.240
to save your brother's life.

30:41.658 --> 30:43.939
To save my brothers life, huh?

30:44.159 --> 30:46.347
Tell me the name of the
person who hired you.

30:46.398 --> 30:48.365
The papers say it was the Mafia.

30:49.084 --> 30:50.385
What do you say?

30:50.786 --> 30:51.998
I say nothing.

30:52.020 --> 30:52.997
I'm innocent.

30:55.524 --> 30:57.429
This is your last chance.

You're a fine piece of ass, Caterina.

No one threatens my brother.

No one.

Martino booked us a hotel in Orvieto...

33:17.094 --> 33:18.527
Better you don't tell Martino.

33:20.064 --> 33:21.700
You suspect him, don't you?

33:24.450 --> 33:25.835
I hate to say it but...

33:25.955 --> 33:27.586
the thought crossed my mind.

33:27.871 --> 33:29.187
Does he have a motive?

33:29.346 --> 33:32.186
Martino and Sofia run
the family business but,

33:32.740 --> 33:34.519
when their father died last year,

33:35.546 --> 33:37.105
he left it to Bernardo.

33:50.088 --> 33:51.674
Ah, Frank.

33:52.406 --> 33:53.762
What a surprise.

33:54.734 --> 33:56.842
This is my old friend, Marcel Tarconi.

33:56.898 --> 34:00.935
No, he means I'm old, not
that we are old friends.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.164
We need a place to spend the night.

34:03.446 --> 34:05.106
You should have told me you were coming,

34:05.107 --> 34:06.207
I have nothing to feed you.

34:06.515 --> 34:07.457
Better find something.

34:07.468 --> 34:08.768
Dieter's coming with the car.

34:09.779 --> 34:11.107
What's with the ambulance?

34:11.797 --> 34:12.581
I'll explain.

34:12.701 --> 34:14.882
Over a glass of my Sagrantino?

34:15.143 --> 34:16.725
Same swill you made last year?

34:17.096 --> 34:19.476
Even worse this year, I'm afraid.

34:26.306 --> 34:28.034
I recognize the boy.

34:29.063 --> 34:30.516
You're taking him to court?

34:31.386 --> 34:32.766
We've had some...

34:33.667 --> 34:34.768
interruptions.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.483
You have cameras here?

34:37.943 --> 34:39.313
I keep an eye out.

34:43.534 --> 34:46.425
It's strange the Mafia would kill a judge.

34:47.348 --> 34:48.565
I don't think they did.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.217
Then who?

34:52.723 --> 34:54.820
You know what I always say, Frank?

34:56.262 --> 34:57.815
Cherchez la femme.

35:10.878 --> 35:13.850
[Dieter laughing and groaning]

35:17.018 --> 35:18.815
- Ah, the brakes?
- There.

35:21.781 --> 35:24.150
You've got to be kidding,
this game is impossible!

35:24.171 --> 35:25.800
It's not like driving a real car.

35:25.847 --> 35:27.602
- Tell me about it.
- Huh?

35:28.095 --> 35:29.344
Can I drive your car?

35:30.372 --> 35:31.381
Not now.

35:31.625 --> 35:33.390
You're not gonna let me, are you?

35:33.977 --> 35:35.320
Anybody hungry?

35:36.906 --> 35:38.750
I thought he would never ask.

35:40.327 --> 35:41.181
Hey...

35:42.373 --> 35:43.568
Let the boy drive.

35:43.870 --> 35:45.382
You know he's twelve?

35:53.713 --> 35:55.929
So, how did you and Frank meet?

35:56.661 --> 35:59.960
We were neighbours in the South of France.

36:00.228 --> 36:02.720
I noticed he kept interesting company.

36:03.368 --> 36:05.371
Marcel is a police inspector.

36:05.536 --> 36:07.525
Frank, I suspect,

36:07.910 --> 36:10.858
is not always on the right side of the law.

36:11.111 --> 36:12.197
But you're friends?

36:12.533 --> 36:14.263
He's a perfectionist.

36:14.293 --> 36:16.774
That's a quality a
Frenchman can appreciate.

36:17.116 --> 36:20.071
But even a perfectionist
can't control every variable.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.006
Not at the speeds you drive.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.016
I didn't say I control variables.

36:24.021 --> 36:25.443
I said I account for them.

36:25.701 --> 36:28.084
But one day you are
bound to make a mistake.

36:28.780 --> 36:29.910
It could cost you your life.

36:30.047 --> 36:31.084
It could.

36:31.812 --> 36:32.998
So why do it?

36:37.523 --> 36:38.542
It pays well.

36:41.338 --> 36:43.525
Oh, Frank, someone's here.

36:46.604 --> 36:48.650
It's okay. She's a friend.

36:49.684 --> 36:51.993
Caterina Boldieu, Marcel Tarconi.

36:52.113 --> 36:53.518
- Enchantée.
- Enchanté.

36:53.913 --> 36:55.157
We need to talk.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.649
Okay.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.629
You've got to call this off.

37:04.749 --> 37:05.881
What are you talking about?

37:06.316 --> 37:07.984
We don't know who's compromising you,

37:08.017 --> 37:09.617
and Magyar wants you dead.

37:09.805 --> 37:11.129
I don't quit a job.

37:11.467 --> 37:12.875
Is that one of your rules?

37:13.089 --> 37:14.391
I've learned to stop making rules,

37:14.419 --> 37:16.048
but I finish what I start.

37:19.996 --> 37:21.330
Not you too!

37:21.582 --> 37:23.615
You can account for variables, Frank, but

37:23.735 --> 37:26.037
like Laura said, you can't control them.

37:26.157 --> 37:27.759
Taking risks is my job.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.078
Dying isn't.

37:29.272 --> 37:31.140
No one's dying, what's got into you?

37:31.340 --> 37:33.142
Laura could ask for a postponement.

37:33.262 --> 37:35.658
So we put the boy through
this all over again?

37:40.671 --> 37:42.060
He's testifying tomorrow.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.435
And no one's gonna stop him.

37:49.138 --> 37:50.935
How about some more wine?

<i>No.</i>

38:15.173 --> 38:17.384
No, we've lost them.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.335
And she hasn't told you where they are?

38:21.222 --> 38:23.390
I need you to stay in your cell tomorrow.

38:24.024 --> 38:24.996
<i>Why?</i>

38:25.601 --> 38:27.085
What are you going to do?

38:28.210 --> 38:29.703
I'm going to kill the boy.

38:31.379 --> 38:33.096
I'm going to kill them all.

38:45.581 --> 38:47.988
- What about breakfast?
- I'm not hungry.

38:54.621 --> 38:55.640
Mind if I join you?

39:02.695 --> 39:04.699
When you were talking last night,

39:05.298 --> 39:07.045
did you really think you could die?

39:08.833 --> 39:09.796
I could.

39:10.951 --> 39:12.016
Aren't you...?

39:12.199 --> 39:13.368
Aren't you afraid?

39:14.223 --> 39:15.185
Of course I am.

39:15.305 --> 39:17.221
Then why do you do it?

39:23.615 --> 39:25.309
Courage doesn't mean you're not afraid

39:25.338 --> 39:26.539
to do the right thing.

39:26.854 --> 39:29.019
Courage means you're
afraid and you do it anyway.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.289
Nobody's gonna hurt you, Luca.

39:32.741 --> 39:34.013
I'm gonna make sure of it.

No problems?

40:21.361 --> 40:22.487
No, nothing.

40:22.672 --> 40:25.322
No sign of Magyar's men
at the courthouse either.

40:26.079 --> 40:27.238
