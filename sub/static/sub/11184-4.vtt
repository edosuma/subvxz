00:01.234 --> 00:02.339
Action!

00:03.871 --> 00:04.906
Don't be afraid.

00:04.971 --> 00:06.383
I came to take you out.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.288
Come on, String. Come on, move it!

00:14.281 --> 00:15.316
Where do you keep it?

00:15.382 --> 00:16.383
What?

00:16.450 --> 00:17.588
That monster machine of yours.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.358
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.330
String, I've got a heat-seeker
targeting the Jet Ranger.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.297
Cate, pull out.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.298
Pull out!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

02:51.471 --> 02:55.647
Mr. Mayor, I very much appreciate
your intercession with the newspapers.

02:57.077 --> 03:00.354
A small contribution to your upcoming campaign.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.724
Tony will see you out.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.239
Sorry about that.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.456
Don't be afraid.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.965
I'm a friend of Dominic Santini's.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.329
I came to take you out.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.134
Come on, let's go.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.197
You won't tell him?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.641
No, señorita.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.837
Wait.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.241
Thank you.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.447
Come on.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.071
Come on, String. Come on, move it!

06:33.793 --> 06:36.239
Oh, come on. Don't cover
your eyes and shake your head.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.572
Hey Dom, the guy's just trying to do his job.

06:38.632 --> 06:42.774
Oh well, the next time, I'll buy a couple
more tickets from the policeman's ball.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.782
Mr. Santini, I need information.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.647
So, what am I, a hostile witness?

06:46.706 --> 06:48.913
Was she forced by Aarons
down there against her will?

06:48.975 --> 06:51.478
We can call the Mexican Government.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.225
Well, not exactly.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.228
"Not exactly kidnapped" doesn't print
very well on extradition papers.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.823
He invited her.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.424
Oh, he was her lover.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.130
I thought you said she was his prisoner.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.193
Look.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.801
He's a hood. He beat her.
He wouldn't let her go.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.970
He kept armed guards around the house

07:14.034 --> 07:16.207
to keep the hitmen out and her in.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.839
Now, is that clear enough?

07:17.904 --> 07:21.078
Yeah, apparently, she lived in
Argentina with her grandmother.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.485
He met her, invited her to Mexico,

07:23.543 --> 07:26.581
complete with a sister for a chaperon, no less.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.183
Nice touch, it worked.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.923
When she wanted to leave, his ego
got in the way. I don't know.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.056
Now, you're describing a lovers' quarrel.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.828
When we went to pick her up,
there was a lot of firepower.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.063
It wasn't exactly a lovers' paradise.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.468
And how'd you manage?

07:45.732 --> 07:46.870
Luck.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.413
Well, luck isn't gonna help our case.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.005
Mexico's out of local jurisdiction.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.709
So, what are you doing here?

07:52.772 --> 07:55.116
Mr. Santini, I'd love to get this guy.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.518
He's into every racket in town,

07:56.576 --> 07:57.850
and he runs them all down there.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.517
Now, unfortunately, he has
contacts south of the border,

08:00.580 --> 08:03.527
which makes extradition very hard to come by.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.329
But if we could make a
kidnapped girl case work,

08:07.387 --> 08:09.560
we could put him out of business.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.628
Hey guys, how do I look?

08:13.593 --> 08:15.368
You got her statement?

08:15.428 --> 08:16.839
You look great.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.001
I feel great.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.638
Now, first of all, we're
gonna get you some clothes,

08:22.702 --> 08:24.682
and then we're gonna work on getting you home.

08:24.738 --> 08:25.978
Let's go, Uncle Dom.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.040
See you later.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.121
Is she staying with you guys?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.158
Yeah, for a couple of days.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.688
I'll put her on a plane.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.695
Yeah, you better keep her
out of sight for a while.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.287
Airports, crowds.

08:39.486 --> 08:42.365
A guy like Aarons can get away with murder.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.190
That's the thing about these old Stearmans.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.726
You think getting the oil pan
cover off is trouble enough,

09:08.782 --> 09:12.127
then you drop a wing nut and you have
to be a contortionist to get it.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.463
Thanks.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.004
My pleasure.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.203
There something I can do for you?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.764
"Something I can do for you"?

09:23.830 --> 09:26.106
Well, I thought I'd get a
much better welcome than that

09:26.166 --> 09:28.442
after traveling all the way
from Pope County, Texas,

09:28.501 --> 09:31.072
just to find you, Stringfellow Hawke.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.279
You know, you could wear this around your neck.

09:44.684 --> 09:45.754
Caitlin.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.423
Deputy Caitlin.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.295
I know that.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.499
How'd you find me?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.936
Chopper pilot with a name
like Stringfellow Hawke?

09:53.993 --> 09:57.839
I just called the first 300
“S Hawkes” in the phone book.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.077
What is that?

10:05.071 --> 10:06.778
That's a Tyler mount.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.218
Use it for shooting film out of choppers.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.380
You do that fancy flying stuff?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.718
Yeah, sometimes.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.326
So, what brought you here?

10:15.415 --> 10:18.089
Oh, I had some time off.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.290
You know, after you shot up
the town and everything,

10:20.353 --> 10:21.991
I took a leave of absence.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.264
Didn't wanna be a flying meter maid anymore.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.861
So, where do you keep it?

10:26.926 --> 10:27.927
What?

10:27.994 --> 10:29.769
That monster machine of yours.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.240
What monster machine?

10:31.297 --> 10:34.005
You know, that black
battleship with the rotors.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.411
It's the most incredible helicopter
I've ever seen in my life.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.278
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.652
Oh, you don't wanna talk about it.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.551
Nothing to talk about.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.118
Okay.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.484
There's one thing I have to tell you.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.222
I brought your friend back.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.321
We found his remains out in the desert.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.291
I'm real sorry.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.596
Thanks.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.240
Hey, you saved my life, even
if you don't wanna admit it.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.078
Stop when you get to the plate.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.684
I can't. It's free.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.017
I don't mean free like money.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.115
I mean free like, "Land of the
free, home of the brave," free.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.050
He must have fed you.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.459
Oh, the best.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.463
Flown in fresh daily from everywhere.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.165
When I talked to your grandmother,
I just couldn't believe it.

11:32.258 --> 11:35.501
I can't figure out how you could
take up with someone like that.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.773
He was charming.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.010
And he was romantic.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.908
And I guess that's why I feel so dirty now.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.614
No. No, honey, no.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.384
No, not dirty.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.058
No. Young, yes.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.527
Maybe even a little innocent.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.589
Not dirty.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.906
Holly!

12:15.535 --> 12:16.843
Holly!

12:17.437 --> 12:18.814
Holly.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.513
Look out. Holly! Holly.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.918
It was Aarons!

12:23.977 --> 12:25.615
No. No, it wasn't.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.056
No, honey, no.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.555
Oh, Uncle Dom.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.055
It was a nightmare, and it won't end.

12:35.655 --> 12:39.034
Little by little.
Little by little, sweetheart.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.503
Pretty.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.407
This isn't a contest. We're friends.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.577
I haven't seen her.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.788
She has an uncle named Santini.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.085
Oh, yeah?

13:00.146 --> 13:01.386
No kidding.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.949
My friend misses her.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.791
Well, if I see her, I'll tell her.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.625
You tell her if she comes back,
my friend will forgive her.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.931
But if we have to come back and get
her, somebody's gonna get hurt.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.384
No deals, no promises.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.216
I just don't have enough work
for another pilot right now.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.256
But if you wanna hang around part-time…

13:32.312 --> 13:33.347
It's a deal.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.414
What's a deal?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.481
What you're offering.

13:35.581 --> 13:36.616
I'm not offering nothin’.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.219
Except to hang around.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.592
Part-time.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.325
And maybe fly a stunt in the movie.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.559
You mean it?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.898
Oh, I don't know, I said maybe.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.862
I'm so sorry.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.776
- It's a shame.
- Come on, let's go.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.595
Some people say, after a funeral,

14:13.486 --> 14:17.059
you should go out with friends
and think of the living.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.971
She's somethin’, isn't she?

14:27.467 --> 14:30.676
A bad dream like she just came out
of, and she's encouraging him.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.384
Well, that was a pretty
philosophical mouthful.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.811
What kind of a crack is that?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.755
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

14:41.814 --> 14:43.487
No, it's not okay.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.859
If you got an attitude problem,
just keep it to yourself.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.226
What did I say?

14:47.286 --> 14:50.392
I got something else to say. This
is a fine way to start a job.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.392
Well, if I can't say what I think,

14:52.458 --> 14:54.404
then I'm gonna pack up my
things and be on my way.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.270
The hell you will. I'm not
through chewing you out yet.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.606
Well, how long is that gonna take?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.511
I don't know.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.709
Maybe not till after you
finish that movie stunt.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.692
Come on, fellas, over here.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.025
Please. Come on. We're losing the light.

15:19.085 --> 15:23.033
Now, when you get up here, crab over there.
Check on the girl, will you, for me?

15:23.356 --> 15:24.391
That's it. That's great.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.835
Now, Carl, what I'm gonna want here
is a full shot of the helicopter,

15:26.893 --> 15:29.203
and then zooming in to a 2-shot of
them by the door. Can you do that?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.798
Is that gonna be a lighting
problem for you, Sam?

15:30.863 --> 15:33.070
You got it? All right.
This is the 15mm on here?

15:33.132 --> 15:34.907
So, what do you do in Pope County?

15:34.967 --> 15:38.005
Oh, well, I was flying traffic
for the Highway Patrol.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.607
But you see, this town was
more like its own country.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.210
The Sheriff and the Judge and
the ranchers and everything,

15:43.276 --> 15:45.051
they could do anything they wanted.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.522
Then Hawke came along.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.749
But I thought you were his girlfriend.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.755
Hardly.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.626
We just met out there.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.563
He's so sad.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.563
I mean, his friend's death really shook him up.

15:58.424 --> 15:59.926
Yeah, well,

15:59.992 --> 16:03.166
if he'd been there a day sooner,
his friend’d still be alive.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.572
Hawke knows that.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.769
It's a tough thing to carry around.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.273
I'd like to ask you a question.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.338
Do I look as dumb as I feel?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.514
Dumber.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.981
Boy, you sure know how to
butter up the boss, don't you?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.088
Hi, there.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.358
Are you the fellow who saves girls' lives?

16:27.587 --> 16:31.057
Well, when I'm not out fighting
famine and pestilence, señorita.

16:31.457 --> 16:32.595
Pestilence and…

16:32.658 --> 16:34.228
Where the hell have you been?

16:35.261 --> 16:37.366
Every time I tried to leave,
the phone would ring.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.875
Nobody was ever there.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.107
Must've been crossed lines.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.044
You know, I saw the results
of your shopping trip.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.778
Did you leave anything
for the rest of the city?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.218
Not a shoe. I broke Dom.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.222
I thought I'd have to hock a chopper.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.417
Good of you to join us, Mr. Hawke.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.723
Real happy to be here, Mr. Carlson.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.092
Yeah, good. Look, we got problems. Big ones.

16:59.151 --> 17:00.687
We're over budget and we're over schedule,

17:00.753 --> 17:02.528
and we gotta be out of here by Saturday.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.157
Making movies is not our job.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.998
Yeah, we just do those little magic things

17:06.058 --> 17:07.366
that add to the excitement, you know.

17:07.425 --> 17:10.930
Oh, is that what they do with what we do?

17:11.396 --> 17:13.308
Look, fellas, please.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.169
Just do your air stunts in one take.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.843
Okay? Bless you.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.478
Nice outfit.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.017
Come on, Dom, let's go.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.349
All right, honey, do you know what to do?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.690
Just mark the spot in the sky.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.559
Everybody's a comic, right?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.598
Places, people!

17:34.654 --> 17:37.157
Forget it. Forget it. I changed my mind.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.965
It's too dangerous, and you
never did the stunt before.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.735
Well, I never kissed a boy before, either.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.537
Till the first time. Somehow, I managed.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.651
Hey, Dom, could I see you for a minute?

18:04.383 --> 18:06.989
All right, rehearsal, people! Settle.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.928
Come here. Come here, kids. Right over here.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.264
Stand on that mark. And you stand right there.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.395
Now, this is a pickup from
where the stars left off.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.303
It's right before your big
air act. So, Hawke and…

18:16.629 --> 18:17.767
Caitlin?

18:17.830 --> 18:21.004
Okay, this is your last moment together.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.444
So, hold her.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.913
Oh, joy.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.147
Go on. You're gonna miss me.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.413
Oh, like a toothache.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.216
Right, right. Now, say goodbye and kiss her.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.588
Remember, we're trying to match
this with the stars' exit.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.520
Do it!

18:43.789 --> 18:46.326
Let's walk through this again.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.732
Come on, let's have some feeling in it.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.706
You do, and I'll bite your lip.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.219
Yeah, yeah. Okay, great, great. That's it

19:04.276 --> 19:05.584
Now you move over to the…

19:05.645 --> 19:07.147
Kids? Kids!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.824
Great, great. Now you move over to the chopper.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.029
That's it. Great. Uh-huh.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.993
All right, now, Caitlin,

19:15.087 --> 19:16.657
this is where you are flying in

19:16.722 --> 19:18.360
to rescue you’re war-correspondent boyfriend,

19:18.424 --> 19:19.732
and suddenly, bang!

19:19.792 --> 19:20.998
- I got it.
- You got it?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.937
The revolutionaries shoot,
and suddenly you're hit.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.372
Then you spin around a couple of times,

19:24.430 --> 19:25.704
you land behind that building,

19:25.765 --> 19:27.438
and Whitey's gonna send up a fireball

19:27.500 --> 19:30.276
so that we all think you're blown
to smithereens. You got it?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.612
Like I said, piece of cake.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.819
Piece of cake, huh?

19:37.209 --> 19:38.950
I'm scared to death.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.421
Lookit, this is your first
time up. Just take it easy.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.789
Play it safe.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.487
And make sure you get back in one piece,

19:45.551 --> 19:47.224
in case they need a 2nd take.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.795
Very funny.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.501
How does it feel?

19:59.565 --> 20:01.101
Cyclic's a little stiff.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.703
Just play it safe all the way.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.906
Come on, boys and girls. Come on.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.243
We haven't got all day. All right?

20:05.304 --> 20:06.942
Okay. Clear.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.514
All right, roll it. We're rolling.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.058
And action!

20:39.171 --> 20:41.879
All right, easy as pie now.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.082
Ready?

20:44.477 --> 20:45.683
Ready.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.049
Okay.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.263
All right, now dive! Make me believe it.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.138
Come on, Caitlin, dive!

21:11.203 --> 21:12.273
Damn.

21:12.338 --> 21:13.476
Dive!

21:20.846 --> 21:23.918
Beautiful! That's it! Beautiful!

21:24.083 --> 21:26.495
Caitlin, pull out! Pull out now!

21:28.420 --> 21:29.694
Oh, she's got trouble.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.860
Use your collective. Pull your nose up.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.301
The cyclic's jammed.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.635
- Come on.
- What are you doin’? She's wonderful.

21:35.694 --> 21:39.141
I finally get a stunt woman with some
guts, and Nervous Nelly… More!

21:40.032 --> 21:44.447
Get this reel! Good girl!

22:24.577 --> 22:25.885
Hey, what happened?

22:25.945 --> 22:27.856
I told you, the cyclic jammed.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.517
No way. I checked it.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.994
Did I break anything, fellas? No.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.060
Am I fine? Yes. Yes, thank you.

22:40.326 --> 22:43.637
This nut didn't just jump loose
from the push-pull tube on its own.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.141
There's wrench scars on that.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.667
That was the greatest stunt I have
ever seen. We got it all on film!

22:48.734 --> 22:51.544
Are you sure you wouldn't like another take?

22:52.204 --> 22:55.447
Welcome back to tierra firma. You did great.

22:56.775 --> 22:58.948
Hey, those were those 2 guys back there.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.752
- What guys?
- I tried to tell you before.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.383
They had a message to deliver for Holly,

23:02.448 --> 23:03.984
and damn near broke my arm doing it.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.824
- Keep your eye on Holly.
- All right.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.806
What can I do for you?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.004
I wanna see Aarons.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.205
He's not here.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.872
Hey, didn't you hear me? Hey, hold it here.

23:57.937 --> 23:58.972
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.279
Hold it, hold it. What is this?

24:02.107 --> 24:03.814
Hey, I wanna see Aarons.

24:03.876 --> 24:04.980
I tried to tell him.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.352
Well, forget it. Forget it.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.790
You wanna talk business, you
talk to me. I'm his associate.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.326
This is personal.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.291
Well, he's in Mexico.

24:12.351 --> 24:14.262
When's he coming back?

24:14.853 --> 24:16.161
Maybe never.

24:16.221 --> 24:19.828
You tell Aarons, wherever he
is, to leave that girl alone.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.536
What girl?

24:21.593 --> 24:25.302
You tell Aarons to stay
away from Holly Matthews.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.275
He's done her enough damage.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.677
If he bends a hair on her head,

24:29.735 --> 24:33.740
we'll go back down there
and tear him apart again.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.085
He'll understand what you mean.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.551
Come on.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.734
Caitlin.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.831
What?

24:58.897 --> 25:00.740
You've been very nice to me.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.044
Well now, why wouldn't I be?

25:03.102 --> 25:05.104
I wouldn't blame you if you were angry.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.616
I mean, String's a special guy.

25:08.307 --> 25:11.584
And you just got here, and suddenly
I come prancing into the picture.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.388
I got a great idea.

25:15.447 --> 25:18.360
Let's just divide him up into
sections. You know, like a bull.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.057
You take the rump and I'll take the shoulder.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.162
Hawke.

25:25.991 --> 25:29.268
Hey, what are you 2 guys talking
so seriously about, huh?

25:29.328 --> 25:30.329
Beef.

25:30.429 --> 25:33.569
What are you 2 guys talking so seriously about?

25:34.533 --> 25:35.807
Turkey.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.308
We're gonna have a little talk with Aarons.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.544
Are you out of your mind? He's a killer.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.343
Well, he wasn't home. We just left a message.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.718
Hey, I'm leaving. It's that simple.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.848
I can't do this to you people.

25:46.912 --> 25:48.949
Now, just stop that. Stop that talk.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.090
Hello?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.594
I got a package for a Miss Matthews.

25:53.652 --> 25:54.756
That's me.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.027
If you can just sign here on line number 5…

25:57.089 --> 25:58.159
Here, I'll sign it.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.224
Okay.

25:59.491 --> 26:02.301
All right. Which one of you guys sent it?

26:03.529 --> 26:04.906
Well, not me.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.408
I work for a living.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.239
Get out of here. Beat it.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.645
Thank you, sir.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.479
Hey, wait.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.351
Let me check this thing.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.617
Stop teasing me. You're getting paranoid.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.965
I'm sorry, baby.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.635
“This spider doesn't kill.”

26:42.434 --> 26:44.107
“It produces pain.”

26:44.169 --> 26:45.739
“Come back, Holly.”

26:45.804 --> 26:49.013
Hey, Dom, we've gotta get her as far
away from here as possible, right now.

26:49.074 --> 26:51.680
No, please, I… I just don't
wanna cause you any more trouble.

26:51.743 --> 26:52.983
Easy does it.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.718
Maybe we should call the police.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.049
No, no. I'll take her to the cabin.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.097
You get her up there. I'll check Aarons out.

27:19.204 --> 27:20.740
To here

27:22.841 --> 27:23.979
and us.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.215
And all of this.

27:38.123 --> 27:39.761
You love it here.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.304
You know, you ran away once.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.414
I do it all the time.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.412
But you have nice friends.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.048
I'm lucky.

28:01.813 --> 28:03.417
Especially Caitlin.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.859
Yeah.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.057
She sure is.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.698
She's not for you.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.769
Who said she was?

28:22.668 --> 28:24.238
It's a wolf.

28:25.003 --> 28:27.984
It's kind of nice to hear. There
aren't many left, you know.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.652
And it probably won't be very long…

28:36.148 --> 28:37.320
Holly.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.955
Holly, no. Holly.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.135
Don't put me on the spot like that.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.478
It's Caitlin, isn't it?

28:59.204 --> 29:00.649
It's no one.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.451
Yeah, I know the type.

29:06.345 --> 29:10.020
Pretty smile, jokes, one of the boys.

29:11.049 --> 29:13.325
Sure she is, until she gets you.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.590
Come on, knock it off.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.428
Hey, I saw you on the movie set.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.834
- It's a scene in a picture.
- Don't give me that!

29:18.890 --> 29:21.962
The Director had to practically pull you apart.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.740
Hey, Holly.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.017
Holly.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.787
Look.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.628
I didn't mean to say anything

29:48.287 --> 29:50.767
that might make you misunderstand.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.628
It's not you.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.817
Just as soon as you get back,
I'll go up and relieve String.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.794
But be careful going up there.

30:19.851 --> 30:23.162
You need clearance when you
cross north of Santa Barbara.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.325
Why?

30:24.389 --> 30:26.528
"Why?" Didn't you read your map?

30:26.591 --> 30:29.162
'Cause it's a restricted zone,
that's why.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.036
Uncle Sam says, "Keep out."

30:31.096 --> 30:34.236
Oh, yeah? What's the military
throwing up at us these days?

30:34.299 --> 30:37.143
They'll shoot you down, little
girl. No doubt about that.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.273
Gee, a boss who worries.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.944
About my chopper. That's it.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.420
Oh, shoot. I forgot my map
case. Crank her up for me?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.385
Don't forget your powder puff.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.517
Dom?

31:25.851 --> 31:28.297
Dom, get out! It's burning!

31:28.920 --> 31:32.094
Get out, Dom! Look at the chopper. Get out!

31:41.099 --> 31:43.511
Dom. Thank God.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.090
Let's get some more foam over here.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.460
Looks like there's another hotspot.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.932
Hey Sebastian, come on over here.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.659
This didn't just happen.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.398
Well, we checked the copter.
There's no indication of foul play.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.498
And the other incident, we checked
the engines. The bolt was old.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.440
2 accidents in one week?

32:13.498 --> 32:15.535
Hey, you couldn't buy a coincidence like that.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.273
Well, unless we find otherwise…

32:17.335 --> 32:20.748
What do you guys want,
a dead body on your desk?

32:24.376 --> 32:26.652
Look, I'm not deaf, dumb and blind.

32:26.711 --> 32:28.384
Yes, I think you guys have trouble.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.223
But what I think doesn't matter. Proof matters.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.489
Now, if you've got any indication

32:32.551 --> 32:34.929
that somebody's involved in
this, that's another ball game.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.226
Hey, you know who did it.

32:36.288 --> 32:40.134
I don't know, and neither of you guys know.
Not in this country.

32:40.525 --> 32:43.267
Now, I wanna get Aarons
in the worst possible way.

32:43.328 --> 32:44.739
And if you can tie him in with this,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.434
I'll hang him from the highest tree.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.034
Until then,

32:50.168 --> 32:52.011
well, have a nice day.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.142
Hey, Casper, let's get
the hose back on the truck.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.482
His hands are tied.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.385
Yeah, but ours aren't.

32:59.744 --> 33:02.384
Look, I'm not gonna sit around
waiting for Aarons' next move.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.290
What are you gonna do?

33:04.349 --> 33:06.329
Get Airwolf, go south.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.256
Danny, wrap up the reporters.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.064
Mr. Santini.

33:13.124 --> 33:14.467
Phone.

33:17.128 --> 33:18.937
Yeah, Santini here.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.501
This is Ed Aarons. I understand
you're looking for me.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.576
Speak of the devil.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.682
Yeah. Yeah, I know where it's at.

33:29.941 --> 33:33.320
Sure, we'll be there. Okay.

33:34.412 --> 33:35.948
He wants to meet us.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.288
He's on.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.762
Ev, see you later.

33:40.318 --> 33:43.026
Again, fortunately, no one was injured.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.761
This is Barney Cabrel, reporting live

33:44.823 --> 33:47.861
from the scene of the helicopter
explosion at Santini Air.

33:47.926 --> 33:49.269
So, did they find anything?

33:49.327 --> 33:52.035
No. No sign that it's been tampered with.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.974
But that doesn't mean it
wasn't, that's for sure.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.739
Hey, do you know where Hawke and Dom went?

33:55.800 --> 33:57.302
I turned around and they disappeared.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.780
Yeah. It was a funny thing.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.113
This guy Aarons that you're
having all the trouble with,

34:01.172 --> 34:03.345
he called here. He wanted to talk to ‘em.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.684
What? No, they can't.

34:06.778 --> 34:07.813
Holly.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.324
They can't talk about me.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.388
Hey, they know
what they're doing.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.522
Look, if you're ever gonna be
free of this Aarons fella,

34:15.587 --> 34:16.621
maybe now is the time.

34:16.688 --> 34:17.893
They'll get hurt over me.

34:17.956 --> 34:20.094
Nah. I can tell you something about those 2.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.331
They can pretty much handle
anything, Aarons included.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.101
He's in this syndicate, and
he's a killer, and he lies.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.005
He lies?

34:27.998 --> 34:30.001
Teddy, get the Captain to check it out.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.655
Hawke made love to me last night.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.790
Well, that's really none of my business.

34:44.849 --> 34:47.125
He wants to marry me, of course,

34:47.252 --> 34:49.197
but it just can't be.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.158
You know,

34:52.223 --> 34:55.431
I know we didn't like each other at first,

34:56.594 --> 35:00.566
but now I feel like we're practically
sisters and I can tell you anything.

35:02.133 --> 35:04.204
It just wouldn't work out.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.449
Well, like I said, it's between you and him.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.852
I wanna leave.

35:10.909 --> 35:13.446
It'll be better this way,
I know. Will you help me?

35:13.511 --> 35:15.388
- Wait for the guys.
- No, I wanna leave now.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.926
Maybe they worked something out.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.723
It'll be better this way, I know.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.421
Will you help me, please, Cate?

35:24.055 --> 35:25.432
What do you need?

35:25.523 --> 35:28.129
I wanna go home to Buenos Aires.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.439
But first I wanna say goodbye to Hawke,

35:31.496 --> 35:33.305
alone, at his cabin.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.542
Would you take me there?

35:36.534 --> 35:37.979
Please?

35:41.239 --> 35:45.187
I'm sure Santini wouldn't mind if
I stole one of his helicopters.

36:44.169 --> 36:46.171
So that's the machine, huh?

36:47.739 --> 36:49.480
You said no cops,

36:50.008 --> 36:52.045
just didn't wanna get caught shorthanded.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.885
Well, I gave you my word.

36:54.879 --> 36:59.123
Hey, whatever else you think
of me, I am a reasonable man.

36:59.184 --> 37:03.098
Reasonable enough to haunt a young girl
out of her mind with your threats?

37:03.154 --> 37:04.224
Threats?

37:04.289 --> 37:07.793
Mr. Santini, I only wanted 2
things from Holly Matthews,

37:07.859 --> 37:11.500
my coded account book, which she
stole when she ran away with you,

37:11.563 --> 37:14.476
and some peace of mind
with her, out of my life.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.603
Out of your life? She was your prisoner.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.607
I tried to get rid of her a half a dozen times.

37:20.672 --> 37:24.085
I would have dumped her in the street
if it hadn't been for that book.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.758
Hey, haven't you caught on yet?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.461
I mean, she's crazy.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.658
She makes it up as she goes along.

37:36.721 --> 37:39.167
Everything with her in life is a drama.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.033
And you spiced it up lately.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.366
Well, sure I did.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.304
She's a good-looking woman,

37:44.362 --> 37:47.138
and, you know, when we first
got together, it was glorious.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.269
But after a while, I couldn't breathe.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.507
I mean, if I smiled at a waitress,

37:52.570 --> 37:54.413
if I tipped a dancer, she was all over ‘em.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.076
You sure you just smiled?

37:56.141 --> 37:58.451
Oh, come on. She tried to knife one girl!

37:58.510 --> 38:00.683
I mean, my friends were hitting on her,

38:00.745 --> 38:03.282
there were spies, her life was in danger.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.957
She even sent herself a
dead cat once in the mail.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.263
I see that rang a bell.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.203
She try to kill herself yet?

38:15.126 --> 38:17.732
Has she tried to kill you? She will.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.841
She even cut the brake lines on my car once.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.903
She sent out notes saying her life was
in danger, she wanted to be rescued.

38:23.968 --> 38:24.969
Oh, no.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.913
No, I don't want that. No, thanks.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.974
Well, what do you want from us, huh?

38:30.041 --> 38:33.215
Why'd you call us here?
What, to get back your book?

38:33.278 --> 38:35.690
I gotta tell you, Aarons, if we had it,

38:35.747 --> 38:37.351
we'd have turned it over to the police.

38:37.415 --> 38:41.420
I got my book. I found it in your
trailer on the movie lot, in her bag.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.466
No, no. I'm going home.

38:43.521 --> 38:46.502
And I don't want you guys
chasing me in that machine.

38:46.558 --> 38:49.038
I don't need that kind of trouble in my life.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.970
Not from her fantasies.

38:52.030 --> 38:55.136
So, what do you say, huh? Let's part friends.

39:06.744 --> 39:09.520
That's for saying you would’ve
dumped her in the street.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.637
You and Hawke must be very close

39:24.696 --> 39:27.677
for him to risk his life
to get you out of that town.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.203
We'd never met.

39:30.535 --> 39:33.539
That gang just had me down,
and Hawke flew over.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.721
I've had a lot of men close to me.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.352
Of course, they never stay close.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.322
Always something happens.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.156
They get together,

39:52.690 --> 39:54.670
make up lies about me.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.643
Or there's someone like you.

40:01.699 --> 40:05.146
Helicopter squawking 1200 at Angels 7,

40:05.203 --> 40:06.876
you're about to enter a restricted zone.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.076
Hey, that's us.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.641
This is 44 Charlie.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.448
Lady, you're flying into a no-no zone.

40:11.509 --> 40:14.285
Roger, Listen, we'll just do a 30° left,

40:14.345 --> 40:18.293
with your permission, cut your corner.
We're a little low on fuel.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.689
You girls’ll never learn.

40:23.388 --> 40:24.696
Chauvinist.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.167
And out.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.335
What's that for?

40:30.762 --> 40:31.797
Just keep flying.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.241
You heard the man. That's a restricted area.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.642
Straight ahead.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.112
They'll shoot us down, Holly.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.776
Then String won't have anybody, either.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.291
They took the chopper?

40:51.349 --> 40:52.919
Where'd they go, they needed a chopper?

40:52.984 --> 40:55.191
The 2 of them were headed up to String's cabin.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.290
They took off just a couple
of minutes ago. Over.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.426
Thanks, Ev. Out.

40:59.490 --> 41:01.663
Dom, give me both turbos again.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.566
Both turbos.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.036
Here we go.

41:12.337 --> 41:13.816
Give me a magnetic.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.817
265, magnetic.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.283
I warned Caitlin to stay away from that area.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.422
Damn that woman. She's still comin’ right in.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.555
What if it's not just a woman?

41:29.287 --> 41:30.664
Mother of God.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.299
Holly, what good is this?

41:38.363 --> 41:40.104
Hey, come on. This is crazy.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.871
We can put down, talk to Hawke…

41:41.933 --> 41:43.640
Just keep flying.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.412
She still hasn't turned off.

41:46.471 --> 41:47.472
I can see that.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.078
Yes sir, we have them on…

41:52.543 --> 41:53.783
Yes, sir.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.547
Yes, sir.

41:55.613 --> 41:58.856
That's it. We scramble jets for a closer ID.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.263
But if we can't turn ‘em, we shoot ‘em down.

42:02.987 --> 42:05.399
44 Charlie, this is Air Force Coastal Defense.

42:05.456 --> 42:09.666
You're instructed to do a 90 left to
175 and get the hell out of there,

42:09.727 --> 42:11.866
or we're gonna blow your fanny off.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.017
Damn! Another bogey just penetrated.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.780
Where are those jets?

42:23.841 --> 42:26.754
It appears to be another helicopter.

42:26.811 --> 42:30.452
"Appears"? What kind of an
identification is "appears"?

42:31.449 --> 42:33.861
Tell our guys to shoot to kill.

42:37.989 --> 42:40.230
Radar configuration says
that thing's a chopper,

42:40.291 --> 42:42.931
but no helicopter can do 1.5 Mach.

42:43.027 --> 42:44.472
Tell him that.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.726
Angel flight to station, commencing fire.

43:08.653 --> 43:09.723
There they are.

43:13.324 --> 43:16.134
String, I've got a heat-seeker
targeting the Jet Ranger.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.834
Pop up a sunburst and raise our IR suppressor.

43:36.581 --> 43:39.027
I'm trying to radio the military Air Command.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.926
Don't waste your time.
They'll think it's a trick.

44:08.746 --> 44:11.488
Cate, we're between you and them. You go home.

44:11.549 --> 44:13.756
We'll play catch till you're safe.

44:16.053 --> 44:17.999
Easier said than done.

44:21.259 --> 44:22.533
It didn't take that sunburst.

44:22.593 --> 44:24.038
It's a sniffer.

44:24.095 --> 44:25.870
Give me a Hellfire.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.395
Pull out.

44:48.886 --> 44:50.832
Come on, pullout!

45:08.839 --> 45:10.716
F-14’s behind us.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.026
Where'd it go, Tango flight?

45:24.088 --> 45:26.568
You just wouldn't believe
it if I told you, sir.

45:46.544 --> 45:48.922
My grandmother says it's beautiful,

45:48.980 --> 45:51.153
where I'll be vacationing.

45:51.849 --> 45:55.763
She said there's a lake and trees,

45:56.087 --> 45:57.828
just like your cabin.

45:59.156 --> 46:01.261
That's what I understand.

46:04.161 --> 46:06.198
I was happy at your cabin.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.369
I loved it there.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.451
Bye.

46:25.149 --> 46:26.685
Thanks, Doc.

46:52.243 --> 46:55.986
Well, with a little love and
care, she's gonna be all right.

46:56.514 --> 46:59.358
Yeah, just gotta keep a good thought.

46:59.417 --> 47:00.521
Hey, Mr. Santini.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.825
That new 500's ready to check out anytime.

47:03.888 --> 47:05.026
Back to business.

47:05.089 --> 47:07.330
Who cares about business?

47:07.391 --> 47:08.768
I'll take your chopper up.

47:08.826 --> 47:10.396
Hold on!

47:11.595 --> 47:13.802
She's just moving right in.

47:14.131 --> 47:16.372
Hey, I'll help you run her out.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.137
We're a lot bigger than she is.

47:22.406 --> 47:25.148
Did I definitely say that you were hired?

47:25.276 --> 47:27.688
- Well…
- Did I even say maybe?

47:27.912 --> 47:30.051
You definitely didn't say maybe.

47:31.515 --> 47:32.687
I'll work cheap.

47:33.584 --> 47:35.393
Magic words, Dom.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.094
You're hired.
