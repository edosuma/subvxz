00:13.609 --> 00:16.567
- Cindy.
- Max.

00:16.969 --> 00:18.641
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:19.929 --> 00:21.248
Working late, huh?

00:21.409 --> 00:24.287
- Yeah. So, what else is new, right?
- Yeah.

00:28.009 --> 00:30.204
It's a match.

00:30.409 --> 00:31.842
You guys survive Y2K all right?

00:32.009 --> 00:34.079
Sure. If you ask me,
it was all just a bunch of hype.

00:34.249 --> 00:35.238
Definitely.

00:35.409 --> 00:40.483
- Well, I guess I'll see you around?
- Yeah, okay.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.321
- Take care.
- Yeah. You too.

00:47.769 --> 00:50.647
Cindy, I know those last few loves
of yours didn't work out.

00:50.809 --> 00:52.481
You've been hurt, and you're scared.

00:52.649 --> 00:55.038
But you gotta take a risk
if you want to find the real thing.

00:55.209 --> 00:57.643
And Max is real. Open up to him.

00:59.089 --> 01:02.081
And Max, Cindy's love and compassion
awaits your discovery,

01:02.249 --> 01:04.638
but she's afraid that you're still
in love with your ex-wife.

01:04.809 --> 01:06.367
You've got to reassure her.

01:07.569 --> 01:09.127
Life is short, you two, so...

01:10.409 --> 01:12.206
Have a better one together, okay?

01:18.689 --> 01:19.963
Listen,

01:20.729 --> 01:22.640
you wanna grab
a cup of coffee or something?

01:22.929 --> 01:25.284
Coffee? Yeah, sure.

01:25.449 --> 01:27.167
- I'd like that.
- Great.

01:36.889 --> 01:40.279
Hello, old friend.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

01:40.449 --> 01:41.768
Drazi.

01:44.289 --> 01:47.042
- You knew I'd find you.
- Listen, Drazi...

01:51.809 --> 01:54.369
You couldn't leave it alone.
You just had to get involved.

01:54.529 --> 01:56.121
You crossed the line.

01:56.849 --> 01:58.328
"Crossed the line"?

01:58.769 --> 02:00.441
I am the line.

02:01.369 --> 02:02.848
You're the one that went too far.

02:03.009 --> 02:05.125
- Now you're gonna pay.
- No, wait.

02:07.889 --> 02:09.322
Not very pleasant.

02:10.408 --> 02:12.161
You're killing me.

02:12.369 --> 02:14.724
I'm gonna do more than that,
a lot more.

02:15.049 --> 02:16.448
How does it feel, huh?

02:16.649 --> 02:18.002
I can tell you. I know.

02:18.169 --> 02:21.206
Thanks to you, I know what it feels like
to have your heart ripped out.

02:21.369 --> 02:23.405
Do you wanna know
that kind of pain, do you?

02:28.369 --> 02:30.360
No. I got a better idea.

02:30.529 --> 02:33.123
You're gonna just hate it.

02:33.809 --> 02:35.765
Your little magic ring

02:35.929 --> 02:38.682
you use to slip in there
between the heartbeats,

02:38.849 --> 02:41.409
plant your little thoughts of love.
Well, I'm gonna borrow it.

02:41.569 --> 02:44.720
I'm gonna use it to tear apart
some of your more recent unions.

02:44.889 --> 02:46.481
No. Drazi, no.

02:46.649 --> 02:50.642
I'm gonna turn love into hate.
And that hate

02:50.969 --> 02:53.802
is gonna slowly
and very painfully kill you.

02:53.969 --> 02:55.641
And in the end,

02:56.329 --> 02:58.445
you're gonna wish
that I had ripped your heart out.

03:01.569 --> 03:03.366
Drazi!

03:09.289 --> 03:10.688
Fifth wheel, cutting in.

03:10.849 --> 03:13.443
- Oh, would you stop that.
- Well, it is a double date.

03:13.609 --> 03:15.884
It would have been a triple date
if Kevin hadn't cancelled.

03:16.049 --> 03:19.405
I know. It seems to be an epidemic
lately, guys cancelling on me.

03:19.569 --> 03:21.082
You know what happens
when they cancel.

03:21.249 --> 03:23.365
- Back to square one.
- Do not pass go.

03:23.529 --> 03:26.282
And all accrued nookie credits
are thrown out.

03:26.649 --> 03:29.641
- There's a penalty?
- Oh, yeah.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.686
You know, this glimpse
at the feminine mystery

03:31.849 --> 03:34.443
frightens me to no end,
so allow me to change the subject.

03:34.609 --> 03:36.645
- What did you think of the movie?
- I liked it.

03:36.809 --> 03:39.482
- Loved it, except for the bell-bottoms.
- It was okay, I guess.

03:39.649 --> 03:41.640
Oh, who are you kidding?
I heard you sniffle.

03:41.809 --> 03:43.765
- I'm fighting a cold.
- Liar.

03:43.969 --> 03:45.084
Jack?

03:45.249 --> 03:47.444
As far as classics go,
it was no Dirty Dozen.

03:47.649 --> 03:49.002
I slept through it.

03:49.209 --> 03:51.882
- You slept through Dirty Dozen?
- No, Love Story.

03:52.049 --> 03:53.721
The last thing I remember
is a hockey game.

03:54.009 --> 03:56.569
- That was the very beginning.
- Okay, let me guess.

03:56.729 --> 03:59.243
Boy meets girl,
Grim Reaper swipes girl

03:59.409 --> 04:01.127
and boy is left
with his hockey skates?

04:01.489 --> 04:03.844
That's a review.
Anybody want a coffee?

04:04.009 --> 04:06.364
I hope so, because I am buying.

04:08.809 --> 04:10.288
So difficult.

04:12.809 --> 04:14.686
What?

04:19.449 --> 04:21.279
Hey, you're coming to
get coffee, right?

04:21.889 --> 04:24.608
I'm just gonna get a cab,
call it a night. I'm pooped.

04:24.769 --> 04:27.727
- I'm sorry that Kevin backed on you.
- It's his loss.

04:27.889 --> 04:31.802
It is so his loss,
because you are beautiful, my sister.

04:31.969 --> 04:33.197
You're so beautiful.

04:33.369 --> 04:35.599
All right, go to your man,
have some coffee.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.765
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you too. Bye-bye.

04:45.689 --> 04:47.645
- I need your help.
- Let go of me.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.640
Hate will destroy everything
if you don't help.

04:49.809 --> 04:52.277
- I am warning you, buddy.
- Phoebe, you gotta believe me.

04:52.449 --> 04:55.998
- I know why you can't find love. I'm...
- Hey, you. Let go of her.

05:01.609 --> 05:03.600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

05:04.729 --> 05:06.526
- What was that about?
- I'm not sure.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.485
Piper, are you still asleep?

06:31.569 --> 06:34.481
Hey, Prue, guess who
got lucky last night.

06:58.049 --> 06:59.368
I'll get it.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.323
- I will get it. Hello?
- Morning.

07:04.489 --> 07:07.845
Hey, Prue. Did that coffee
keep someone up all night?

07:08.009 --> 07:10.807
Okay, believe it or not,
all we did was talk.

07:10.969 --> 07:13.164
- Yeah, right.
- No, I swear.

07:13.329 --> 07:15.968
Look, we just talked about everything.
It was really great.

07:16.129 --> 07:18.563
Really?
How did he react to the witch part?

07:18.729 --> 07:21.243
Cute. All right, where's Piper?

07:21.409 --> 07:23.081
Oh, she's still at Dan's.

07:23.289 --> 07:24.802
Hey, if only I'd bagged Mr. Creepy,

07:24.969 --> 07:27.039
we could have scored
a Halliwell hat trick last night.

07:27.209 --> 07:29.006
- Don't be mad.
- No, I'm not mad.

07:29.169 --> 07:31.808
I'm thrilled, for you both.
I mean, it's been a long time.

07:31.969 --> 07:33.288
You deserve to be happy.

07:33.529 --> 07:35.724
You're gonna need
a new lock on that back door.

07:36.969 --> 07:38.118
Phoebe?

07:42.889 --> 07:46.325
All right, I'm getting rather used
to you kicking love in the teeth.

07:46.489 --> 07:49.049
Okay. Who are you,
and what do you want?

07:49.209 --> 07:51.439
More importantly,
I know who you are, Phoebe.

07:52.569 --> 07:55.003
And that's why I'm here.
I need your help.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.765
- Charmed Ones kind of help.
- I will ask again, who are you?

07:58.929 --> 08:00.920
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

08:01.089 --> 08:03.842
- Try me.
- Well, for lack of a better name, I'm...

08:05.009 --> 08:07.000
...Cupid.

08:15.169 --> 08:16.158
Oh, my.

08:16.369 --> 08:19.327
Eggs over, bacon crisp,
box of jewellery and dry toast.

08:19.489 --> 08:20.842
A box of what?

08:21.049 --> 08:22.880
Do you want a morning paper
with that?

08:23.049 --> 08:25.483
- What did you do?
- It's not a big deal. It's not a ring.

08:26.009 --> 08:28.125
But I don't want you to feel
like you gotta keep it.

08:28.289 --> 08:31.042
- If you wanna take it back, you can...
- I get it, I get it.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.328
You gonna open it?

08:42.409 --> 08:44.160
Because if you want to,
you can take it back.

08:58.369 --> 09:00.599
Hey, is something...?

09:01.289 --> 09:04.565
Phoebe, what are you doing in here?
How did you get in here?

09:04.729 --> 09:06.481
We have got a very big problem.

09:07.249 --> 09:08.523
Piper, Cupid. Cupid, Piper.

09:08.689 --> 09:11.249
Hi, sorry to interrupt. Glad things
are working with you and Dan.

09:11.449 --> 09:13.326
- What?
- You have to come home really fast.

09:13.529 --> 09:16.123
Yeah, a demon of hate stole my ring,
and he'll use it to find loves

09:16.289 --> 09:19.167
that I put together so he can destroy
them, which will in turn destroy me.

09:19.329 --> 09:20.603
- Wait.
- He's telling the truth.

09:20.809 --> 09:23.039
The demon's name is Drazi.
He's in the Book of Shadows.

09:23.209 --> 09:25.245
Phoebe's working on the potion
that'll vanquish him.

09:25.409 --> 09:27.320
- And Prue is on her way home.
- Home from where?

09:27.489 --> 09:30.720
From Jack's.
Okay, hurry, okay? Kiss very fast.

09:40.249 --> 09:41.568
Okay.

09:41.729 --> 09:43.447
Okey-dokey.

09:46.249 --> 09:48.843
...the matter?
- Yes, there is.

09:49.009 --> 09:52.888
But not with you. There is absolutely
nothing the matter with you.

09:54.689 --> 09:55.917
But I do have to go.

09:56.329 --> 09:59.207
Hold on. What happened?
I don't understand.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.485
It has nothing to do with you,
I swear.

10:01.689 --> 10:04.123
Then what does it have to do with?

10:04.849 --> 10:07.409
It's complicated.
But thank you for this,

10:07.569 --> 10:09.480
and you'll see it on me
tonight at the club.

10:34.649 --> 10:36.685
Hello, young lovers.

10:38.369 --> 10:41.918
So we're actually supposed
to believe that you're Cupid?

10:42.129 --> 10:43.721
So you guys can believe
in warlocks

10:43.889 --> 10:45.447
and demons,
but you can't believe in me?

10:45.649 --> 10:47.526
- Where's the chubby baby?
- Guys.

10:47.729 --> 10:49.720
- And the bow and arrow?
- Where's the warty chins,

10:49.889 --> 10:52.244
hooked noses and pointy hats?

10:52.569 --> 10:54.605
All right, show us something
supernatural.

10:54.769 --> 10:57.124
Drazi took my ring.
It's my power, it's how I get in.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.883
- Get in?
- People's hearts, to awaken love.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.368
See, but Drazi is all about hate.

11:01.529 --> 11:04.282
And he's gonna use the ring to get
in the same way. We're wasting time.

11:04.689 --> 11:06.998
You're still gonna have
to back up the Cupid claim.

11:07.369 --> 11:08.882
Okay, fine.

11:09.129 --> 11:12.724
Dan, Jack, Clay.
Andy, my sincerest condolences.

11:12.889 --> 11:16.199
Eric in London, Alan in college.
Not Jeremy the warlock.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.843
Joe in college, Barry in high school,
Tim in eighth grade.

11:19.209 --> 11:22.599
Ken, Kyle, Steve, Mike, Ken again.

11:22.889 --> 11:27.724
Brian, Joel, Martin, Peter,
Paul. Tony.

11:28.129 --> 11:30.484
Okay, you know I didn't love
all those guys, right?

11:30.649 --> 11:32.082
Yeah, well, they wanted to love you,

11:32.249 --> 11:34.080
but your closed heart
eventually sent them away.

11:34.249 --> 11:37.286
My closed heart?
I do not have a closed heart.

11:37.449 --> 11:39.724
Look, if people get the feeling
that there's nothing there,

11:39.889 --> 11:42.039
eventually it's hasta la vista, Phoebe.

11:42.449 --> 11:44.485
That explains the recent rash
of cancelled dates.

11:46.209 --> 11:50.248
Okay, so wait, our past relationships,
you made those happen?

11:50.569 --> 11:53.037
Well, actually, my assignment here
is only two years old.

11:53.249 --> 11:55.319
I helped you two
meet Jack and Dan,

11:55.769 --> 11:58.203
but most of your prior loves
were the work of fellow agents.

11:58.489 --> 11:59.888
- Agents?
- Oh, yeah.

12:00.049 --> 12:02.609
I'm just one of many.
We work in secret all over the world,

12:02.769 --> 12:04.043
making connections.

12:04.209 --> 12:05.801
Did you connect me and Leo?

12:06.649 --> 12:08.958
No, that was the work of you two.

12:09.569 --> 12:12.083
Those connections we're forbidden
to make, for obvious reasons.

12:12.609 --> 12:15.077
Can we go back to the
hasta la vista remark, please?

12:15.249 --> 12:18.400
We don't have time right now to debate
the topic of your closed heart, Phoebe.

12:18.569 --> 12:21.527
We gotta finish the potion so we can
vanquish Drazi before it's too late.

12:21.689 --> 12:23.884
Okay, how are we supposed
to find him?

12:24.089 --> 12:26.159
The same way he can find me.
We can sense each other.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.399
We're connected in a cosmic way.

12:28.689 --> 12:30.725
There's a fine line
between love and hate.

12:30.889 --> 12:31.958
- Oh, brother.
- Hey,

12:32.129 --> 12:34.438
don't take Drazi lightly.
You guys are in danger as well.

12:34.609 --> 12:36.486
We're in danger every day.
We're used to it.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.804
Not like this.

12:37.969 --> 12:40.847
Look, if Drazi succeeds, eventually
he'll kill your ability to love.

12:41.009 --> 12:42.328
And believe me,

12:42.489 --> 12:44.241
that's a fate worse than death.

12:48.529 --> 12:49.803
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

12:54.049 --> 12:56.279
Sorry, they didn't have any roses.

12:57.169 --> 12:59.922
You're too good to be true.

13:00.129 --> 13:01.801
I still can't believe
this is all happening.

13:01.969 --> 13:03.482
Believe it.

13:09.009 --> 13:12.046
Touching. Really touching.

13:12.249 --> 13:17.528
Cindy, could you be a bigger fool.
He's still sleeping with his ex-wife.

13:18.049 --> 13:23.601
He looks at you as a desperate,
lonely woman. Easy sex.

13:23.889 --> 13:26.722
Max, she's nothing
but a gold-digging tramp

13:26.889 --> 13:31.440
who wants to hitch her wagon
to your big fat wallet.

13:31.609 --> 13:34.407
Just as soon marry you
and kill you for the insurance.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.523
Bye-bye.

13:40.249 --> 13:42.126
- You pathetic...
- Bitch.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.644
Take your damn flowers.
Give them to your ex-wife.

13:44.809 --> 13:48.006
The bank's closing, baby. You're not
laying one finger on this guy's money.

13:48.249 --> 13:50.285
- Screw you.
- Up yours.

14:05.849 --> 14:07.407
Prue, Phoebe.

14:09.769 --> 14:11.999
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

14:14.209 --> 14:16.325
- What's wrong?
- It's Drazi.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.168
He's killing...

14:18.809 --> 14:20.686
...love.

14:32.049 --> 14:33.402
Yes, ma'am, go ahead.

14:33.569 --> 14:36.208
He just walked into traffic.

14:36.889 --> 14:38.447
- Dumb-ass.
- Oh, yeah?

14:39.289 --> 14:41.803
- Is he gonna die?
- I can't answer that, ma'am.

14:41.969 --> 14:45.006
Because he should, you know.
I don't think I've ever known anyone

14:45.169 --> 14:47.444
who deserved to be hit
by a car more than that guy.

14:48.049 --> 14:49.368
It's Max.

14:50.529 --> 14:51.644
Is he one of yours?

14:51.809 --> 14:53.686
Yeah, I matched him up
with Cindy last night.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.158
- She was afraid to risk love too.
- Are you picking on me?

14:56.369 --> 14:58.041
- Phoebe, I'm...
- Do you think it's easy

14:58.209 --> 15:00.279
finding love with all
the demon-hunting we have to do?

15:00.449 --> 15:01.928
Your sisters aren't having a problem.

15:02.089 --> 15:04.762
You know what, let's just stay focused.
We have things to do.

15:04.969 --> 15:07.608
- Are you sure Drazi did this?
- I'm positive.

15:08.049 --> 15:09.528
He's still here too. I can feel him.

15:09.689 --> 15:11.441
- He's close.
- Where?

15:14.609 --> 15:15.928
There.

15:18.089 --> 15:19.602
Do you think he knows who we are?

15:20.969 --> 15:22.288
- Apparently.
- He's getting away.

15:22.449 --> 15:23.643
- Do you have the potion?
- Yes.

15:23.809 --> 15:25.640
All right, let's go.

15:26.169 --> 15:28.319
- We're not gonna catch him.
- Piper, freeze him.

15:28.489 --> 15:30.320
- He's too far away.
- Hit him with the trolley!

15:30.529 --> 15:33.248
- I can't move the trolley.
- Somebody better do something fast.

15:38.649 --> 15:40.367
- What?
- Surprise.

15:42.529 --> 15:43.962
That didn't work.

15:54.089 --> 15:56.398
- Are you back with us?
- I think so.

15:56.809 --> 15:58.959
I really gotta get a handle on that.

15:59.169 --> 16:01.729
- I don't understand.
- She astral-projected.

16:01.929 --> 16:03.999
- Did you get him?
- No, I just slowed him down a bit.

16:04.169 --> 16:06.239
You guys, I'm fine.
Go get him. Hurry.

16:09.409 --> 16:11.604
God, I love this new power.

16:17.249 --> 16:19.240
Hiding behind witches' skirts?

16:19.449 --> 16:21.360
Stealing things
that don't belong to you?

16:23.249 --> 16:24.682
Okay, go.

16:27.009 --> 16:28.488
What the...?

16:35.649 --> 16:37.799
No. No!

16:43.849 --> 16:45.407
- Did you get him?
- Did we?

16:46.049 --> 16:48.563
Sure looks like it, but I don't know
what happened to my ring.

16:48.729 --> 16:50.879
Shouldn't have been affected
by what we did to Drazi.

16:51.049 --> 16:54.678
So that's it, right?
You're done, you can just move on?

16:54.849 --> 16:56.441
In a hurry to get rid of me, Phoebe?

16:56.729 --> 16:58.082
Look, Cupid,

16:58.249 --> 17:01.286
I know you're just trying to help, but
did you ever think that maybe I'm just

17:01.449 --> 17:04.486
- not ready for love right now?
- No, you're more than ready.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.446
- You know what? Don't start. Just go.
- I need the ring to get back.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.483
I mean, they'll issue me another one.
But the problem is

17:10.648 --> 17:13.003
- I need it to get back to them.
- Wait, you're stuck here?

17:13.209 --> 17:14.961
No, actually, you can help
get me back home.

17:15.128 --> 17:16.561
One more potion,

17:16.729 --> 17:19.641
some well-chosen words from the
Charmed Ones, and I'm on my way.

17:20.368 --> 17:23.520
- Care to help me with that potion?
- Me? Why me?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.845
Because you're free tonight
and they have dates.

17:26.009 --> 17:28.807
Hey, how did you know...?
Never mind. Scratch that.

17:36.929 --> 17:39.568
- What are you smiling at?
- You.

18:00.889 --> 18:03.767
Well, looks like
you can't kill love after all.

18:05.449 --> 18:08.202
But you sure can screw with it.

18:11.849 --> 18:12.838
Very nice. Do you like it?

18:13.009 --> 18:13.998
I love it.

18:14.169 --> 18:17.047
Well, thank your sister.
She helped me pick it out.

18:17.249 --> 18:20.286
- Okay, guilty.
- Well, thank you both.

18:20.609 --> 18:22.327
And I'll thank you again later.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.358
If that's all it takes,
where can I buy one?

18:27.009 --> 18:28.328
Okay.

18:30.049 --> 18:32.643
You know what, why don't we
find a table and get some food.

18:40.489 --> 18:42.047
So this will send you back?

18:42.249 --> 18:45.161
I drink this, you and your sisters
say the magic words, and I'm gone.

18:45.369 --> 18:47.678
I cannot believe that I'm stuck here
doing the grunt work

18:47.849 --> 18:50.317
- while they're...
- Twisting the night away?

18:50.849 --> 18:52.885
- Don't blame them.
- No, I'm not blaming anybody.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.564
- It's just, I'm here.
- Stuck with me.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.001
I'm sorry, but did you do
something specific to tick Drazi off,

19:01.169 --> 19:04.127
or did he also find your honesty to be
a complete and total pain in the ass?

19:04.289 --> 19:06.200
Drazi fell in love
with a mortal woman.

19:06.369 --> 19:09.247
I redirected her love towards
a mortal man, away from Drazi.

19:09.969 --> 19:12.358
She's married now, very happy.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.958
But Drazi blames me
for denying him love.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.126
A hundred slow strokes there.

19:21.009 --> 19:22.647
So are you telling me
that demons love?

19:23.289 --> 19:24.688
Frighteningly so.

19:25.609 --> 19:27.327
Love of evil, love of fear.

19:27.489 --> 19:30.401
Sometimes a love of the very things
they hate. In this case, a human being.

19:32.249 --> 19:33.807
You know, if a demon
can open his heart,

19:33.969 --> 19:35.368
there's hope for you too, Phoebe.

19:35.529 --> 19:38.441
Okay, you know,
my heart is not closed, okay?

19:38.609 --> 19:41.646
- It's open, just not to everybody.
- Your heart is closed.

19:42.289 --> 19:43.563
I'm picky.

19:43.729 --> 19:46.197
- No, you're terrified.
- Of what? What am I terrified of?

19:46.369 --> 19:48.121
I don't know, you tell me.

19:48.289 --> 19:49.688
I don't wanna play this game.

19:50.369 --> 19:53.167
Well, then at least stir correctly.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.282
Like that.

19:59.089 --> 20:00.408
So how does this work?

20:00.689 --> 20:02.202
It transports you.

20:02.649 --> 20:06.528
It's your travel potion
with an aphrodisiac kicker.

20:06.969 --> 20:08.641
Really, an aphrodisiac?

20:09.529 --> 20:10.848
Lavender, oysters,

20:11.009 --> 20:14.285
rosemary and chocolate
and your basic caris-root compound.

20:15.009 --> 20:16.283
But the key ingredient

20:16.929 --> 20:18.203
is desire.

20:19.689 --> 20:20.963
Desire?

20:21.969 --> 20:23.561
A desire to go home.

20:24.289 --> 20:25.688
Because home...

20:26.449 --> 20:27.962
Is where your heart is.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.082
Are you afraid of loss?

20:32.729 --> 20:35.926
You know, I swear, if you barf up
"It's better to have loved and lost

20:36.089 --> 20:38.398
than never to have loved at all,"
I might just have to...

20:46.209 --> 20:47.767
Smells really good.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.841
So tell me, what has not loving
gotten you?

20:55.249 --> 20:56.682
It's kept me safe.

20:57.209 --> 20:58.608
Safe from what?

21:00.689 --> 21:02.247
From people leaving.

21:03.169 --> 21:04.443
Your mother?

21:05.689 --> 21:07.805
- Yeah.
- And your father?

21:12.209 --> 21:13.642
And you.

21:16.129 --> 21:17.767
Are you falling for me?

21:18.009 --> 21:21.797
No, I am not falling for you,
thank you very much.

21:21.969 --> 21:25.564
Ladies and gentlemen, Phoebe
Halliwell, running away from love.

21:25.729 --> 21:29.404
You're Cupid. Okay?
You're the one that's leaving me.

21:29.569 --> 21:32.561
Look, Phoebe, what I am is
the potential for true love, that's all.

21:33.369 --> 21:36.247
Because once you let love in,
it'll never leave.

21:37.689 --> 21:39.839
Don't confuse the message
with the messenger, Phoebe.

21:40.009 --> 21:42.648
It's what you've always done.
See, messengers make mistakes.

21:42.849 --> 21:44.362
They get lost, they run away.

21:45.289 --> 21:46.802
They even die.

21:46.969 --> 21:50.439
But their message, "open your heart,"
it comes from life itself. Hear it.

21:50.969 --> 21:52.288
For my sake.

21:53.369 --> 21:55.519
And yours.

21:59.529 --> 22:00.803
Your having an in with the owners

22:00.969 --> 22:03.164
of one of the hottest clubs in town
has its benefits.

22:03.329 --> 22:05.797
- Free chicken wings.
- To name one.

22:05.969 --> 22:09.006
- And the pleasure of our company?
- And to name two more.

22:09.169 --> 22:10.443
Thank you.

22:10.769 --> 22:12.361
Bathroom break, Piper?

22:12.529 --> 22:14.838
All right, yes, ma'am.
See you boys in a minute.

22:15.009 --> 22:16.362
All right.

22:20.769 --> 22:22.725
Oh, my God, I have to pee.

22:23.849 --> 22:25.362
Okay.

22:26.409 --> 22:28.047
You're okay with that, aren't you?

22:28.289 --> 22:29.768
Okay with what?

22:30.169 --> 22:31.602
This.

22:31.769 --> 22:33.680
I mean, I don't really want you
mad at me.

22:33.849 --> 22:35.123
Why would I be mad at you?

22:35.649 --> 22:37.685
Because I let Dan buy it for you.

22:38.129 --> 22:39.482
No, Prue, it's okay.

22:39.769 --> 22:40.918
It's great.

22:41.569 --> 22:45.164
Really. And you don't wish
that it came from Leo?

22:45.329 --> 22:46.682
No.

22:47.089 --> 22:49.842
I don't, really.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.127
This feels strange.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.728
What do you mean?

22:54.129 --> 22:55.847
Well, I mean, we have these...

22:56.089 --> 22:59.320
...guys out there waiting for us.
Who care about us.

22:59.769 --> 23:03.125
Correct me if I'm wrong, but things
are going pretty well right now, right?

23:03.289 --> 23:06.520
Yeah, nothing like a night out on the
town after a hard day of demon-killing.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.088
Okay, I'm serious.

23:08.849 --> 23:10.441
I mean...

23:10.609 --> 23:12.042
You know...

23:12.209 --> 23:14.200
Think about it.
I mean, we did great today.

23:14.369 --> 23:17.406
And now tonight, it's like we're just...

23:17.569 --> 23:19.605
Finding a balance in our lives?

23:20.169 --> 23:21.568
Exactly.

23:22.209 --> 23:23.961
I do feel pretty good.

23:24.489 --> 23:26.366
Yeah, I think
we're gonna be okay.

23:26.649 --> 23:29.686
Except that there's still
our little secret.

23:29.969 --> 23:34.201
Oh, Piper, everybody has secrets,
including Jack and Dan.

23:34.369 --> 23:37.805
Yeah, well, unless they're
transvestite Nazi war criminals

23:37.969 --> 23:40.802
with great face-lifts,
then I think we've got them beat.

23:41.369 --> 23:43.644
Okay, so we're never
gonna have normal lives.

23:43.809 --> 23:44.878
Not ever.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.483
But that doesn't mean
that we can't try sometimes.

23:47.809 --> 23:50.118
With someone like Dan, perhaps?

23:50.969 --> 23:54.564
With whoever, sweet girl,
I just want you loved.

23:54.729 --> 23:56.481
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

23:58.089 --> 24:00.239
About time.

24:00.489 --> 24:04.277
Dan, I will never understand the whole
tandem pit stop thing that women do.

24:04.489 --> 24:05.763
Yeah.

24:05.929 --> 24:08.284
- Hey, Jack, speaking of mysteries...
- Yeah.

24:08.449 --> 24:11.088
You know, Piper has this strange
habit of sometimes just sort of...

24:11.249 --> 24:12.682
- Vanishing?
- Yeah.

24:12.889 --> 24:14.607
Prue does it too.

24:15.049 --> 24:16.767
I figured that. Does it bug you?

24:16.929 --> 24:20.444
A little, but I'm not gonna give her
the third degree about it.

24:20.609 --> 24:23.442
It's like time just stands still
for a few seconds.

24:23.609 --> 24:26.362
And when it starts up again,
she's like a total different person.

24:26.929 --> 24:28.760
- Ask her about it.
- No, I have.

24:28.929 --> 24:31.489
- She gives me the run-around.
- Then don't ask.

24:33.409 --> 24:35.445
Hey, guys,
are Prue and Piper around?

24:35.609 --> 24:37.679
Yeah, they're in the ladies' room.

24:37.849 --> 24:39.601
- Thanks.
- Excuse me, have we met?

24:39.809 --> 24:42.039
Yeah, you look really familiar.

24:43.209 --> 24:44.722
I've been around.

24:45.169 --> 24:46.966
Yeah. Okay, come on.

24:49.729 --> 24:51.048
And see, that's another thing.

24:51.249 --> 24:53.763
There's strange guys
that always show up at their place.

24:53.929 --> 24:57.046
They pop in, they pop out.
Who the hell are they?

25:04.569 --> 25:07.561
It sounds like someone's
falling in love.

25:07.729 --> 25:09.560
Yeah, maybe.

25:26.809 --> 25:29.039
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

25:29.209 --> 25:31.643
Evening, ladies.
I trust everything's going well.

25:32.369 --> 25:34.041
- Very well.
- Prue?

25:34.769 --> 25:39.240
Well, it's a little early to tell, but all
the signs are pointing to maybe.

25:40.049 --> 25:41.960
Did you get everything
we need to send him home?

25:42.129 --> 25:46.361
Yeah. He drinks this while
we say this, and he's gone.

25:46.529 --> 25:48.008
Any idea where you wanna do this?

25:48.169 --> 25:49.887
In there. Stockroom.

25:51.169 --> 25:53.444
Is this gonna take very long,
because, you know...?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.805
Go tell your boys
you'll be back in a few minutes.

25:56.249 --> 25:58.683
- Okay.
- And don't dawdle.

26:01.289 --> 26:03.803
Ain't love grand?

26:07.409 --> 26:10.287
Welcome back. I was starting
to get a little worried there.

26:21.129 --> 26:26.157
Dan, Piper still loves Leo.

26:26.849 --> 26:29.568
Always has, always will.

26:29.849 --> 26:34.400
You are nothing more
than geographically desirable.

26:34.849 --> 26:39.798
After all, a girl can't get much closer
than the stud next door.

26:45.409 --> 26:47.127
Jack, Jack, Jack.

26:47.449 --> 26:50.122
Does the term "transition man"
mean anything to you?

26:50.289 --> 26:54.328
Well, it should,
because Prue is using you.

26:55.169 --> 26:59.481
You are everything
she always knew she never wanted.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.520
And now for you, Piper.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.248
What's the matter?

27:11.449 --> 27:12.882
I can't believe it.

27:13.129 --> 27:14.881
What, is it Drazi?

27:15.129 --> 27:16.881
He's alive.

27:19.089 --> 27:20.442
Why don't you just admit it.

27:20.609 --> 27:22.201
You're just using me
to make Leo jealous.

27:22.369 --> 27:24.837
- Can you leave him out of this?
- I'd love to. What about you?

27:25.009 --> 27:27.762
Rebound guy, is that it? What makes
you think I'm gonna take this crap?

27:27.929 --> 27:30.648
You think I'm just gonna jump in the
sack with you on the second date?

27:30.809 --> 27:33.482
- Why don't you just drop dead.
- I can't believe you're threatened.

27:33.649 --> 27:35.844
You think I'm an idiot?
You think I don't know?

27:36.049 --> 27:37.528
- All right, you guys...
- Shut up!

27:38.929 --> 27:42.319
- It isn't over between you two, is it?
- That's really none of your business.

27:42.489 --> 27:44.207
- Fine, why don't we just end it.
- Fine.

27:44.369 --> 27:47.202
- We are dating, aren't we?
- No, we're not. Not anymore.

27:47.369 --> 27:48.961
And you can have that back too.

27:49.129 --> 27:52.007
Fine. I'm sure Leo will replace it with
something that means more anyway.

27:52.169 --> 27:54.205
- Probably.
- I'm just glad that nothing happened.

27:54.369 --> 27:55.563
Yeah, well, you and me both.

27:55.729 --> 27:57.799
I'm really glad.
I mean, I learned a valuable lesson.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.802
- Never go out with a jerk.
- Thanks for the evening, Prue.

28:00.969 --> 28:02.402
- All right, bye-bye.
- Wait, wait.

28:02.569 --> 28:04.844
It's not them, Phoebe,
they're caught in Drazi's spell.

28:05.009 --> 28:08.319
- If he did this, why didn't you sense it?
- Because I thought he was dead.

28:08.529 --> 28:10.121
You're still here?

28:10.289 --> 28:13.008
None of this would have happened
if you would have just left us alone.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.761
Now, get out. Get out of my club!

28:14.929 --> 28:17.079
- Wait, where are you going?
- There's nothing I can do.

28:17.249 --> 28:18.921
- They're trapped.
- We are not trapped.

28:19.089 --> 28:21.557
For the first time in my life,
I see things how they really are.

28:21.729 --> 28:24.004
Now, whoever you are,
whatever you're selling, just get out.

28:24.169 --> 28:27.241
No, no. Don't. Listen to me.
Okay, hi, hi. Look.

28:27.409 --> 28:30.719
You guys are under a spell.
Okay, this is not you. Listen to me.

28:30.889 --> 28:33.005
If you're with him,
why don't you go too.

28:33.209 --> 28:35.086
What?

28:36.369 --> 28:38.246
No. You guys. What...?

28:40.049 --> 28:42.643
We vanquished Drazi.
How is this happening?

28:42.849 --> 28:45.409
- The ring must have saved him.
- What, so he's invincible now?

28:45.569 --> 28:47.048
Maybe not.

28:47.209 --> 28:49.245
Maybe if destroying the loves
that I put together

28:49.409 --> 28:51.525
is killing me,
maybe the reverse is true.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.964
Patching things up between
everybody just might kill him.

28:54.129 --> 28:56.723
But you can't do that without the ring.

28:56.889 --> 28:58.641
Well, I've got you.

28:58.809 --> 29:00.162
I'm sorry, what?

29:00.329 --> 29:03.685
Your heart's as big and as true
as any I've ever seen, Phoebe.

29:03.849 --> 29:05.248
You'll be my ring.

29:05.409 --> 29:09.118
I'm... I'm flattered, I think. But I have
no idea what you're talking about.

29:09.329 --> 29:12.287
You will. Come on, we've gotta start
with the first couple Drazi tore apart.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.480
Okay.

29:16.489 --> 29:19.083
I cannot believe Jack.
Who the hell does he think he is?

29:19.249 --> 29:21.604
Jack? What about Dan?
We're out on a date

29:21.769 --> 29:24.078
and he accuses me of being in love
with someone else.

29:24.249 --> 29:25.523
Totally out of line.

29:25.969 --> 29:29.006
- We're better off without them.
- Well, certainly not worth crying over.

29:29.169 --> 29:31.683
I have never hated someone
so much in my entire life.

29:31.849 --> 29:33.248
Me either.

29:35.809 --> 29:37.561
Although I have to admit,

29:37.889 --> 29:40.403
some of the things Dan said
were kind of true.

29:40.689 --> 29:43.328
I do think about Leo sometimes.

29:44.009 --> 29:47.001
Jack wasn't wrong when he said
I was on the rebound.

29:47.169 --> 29:49.080
Still, it's all so weird. I mean,

29:49.249 --> 29:52.241
one minute the four of us
are laughing and having a great time.

29:52.449 --> 29:54.963
And the next, we're all acting like
we hate each other.

29:57.209 --> 30:01.805
- What?
- I was just thinking about Drazi.

30:01.969 --> 30:05.928
No way. He couldn't have had anything
to do with this. We vanquished him.

30:07.369 --> 30:10.361
- Jack's scum.
- So's Dan.

30:12.449 --> 30:14.405
- Are you scum?
- No, I'm not scum.

30:14.569 --> 30:16.082
I knew you weren't.

30:17.289 --> 30:18.404
There she is. We gotta hurry.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.918
But wait, I'm still not exactly sure
what the plan is.

30:21.089 --> 30:23.000
- It's simple. Just talk to her.
- About what?

30:23.169 --> 30:25.239
She's just the same as you.
Her fears are your fears.

30:25.409 --> 30:27.365
Just pretend
you're talking to yourself.

30:27.769 --> 30:30.886
Here she comes. Cindy? Hi.

30:32.129 --> 30:34.768
- Do I know you?
- No, but we know you.

30:34.929 --> 30:36.408
And we know about Max.

30:36.609 --> 30:38.361
- How is he?
- I don't know.

30:38.529 --> 30:41.043
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened,

30:41.209 --> 30:45.043
and I'm not even sure how
it happened. But I'm sorry.

30:45.329 --> 30:46.648
Hurry. Hurry.

30:46.809 --> 30:48.640
Cindy, Cindy. Look, look.

30:49.249 --> 30:50.967
Sooner or later,

30:51.409 --> 30:53.525
Max's pain will go away.

30:53.849 --> 30:55.362
But yours won't.

30:55.889 --> 30:58.767
- Excuse me?
- I mean, it hasn't yet, has it?

30:59.049 --> 31:01.358
The pain of love lost deepens

31:01.809 --> 31:03.879
if you don't deal with it.

31:05.609 --> 31:07.406
Look, I know.

31:07.649 --> 31:09.685
I know what it's like, believe me.

31:09.849 --> 31:12.727
I closed myself off to love, too,
because I was afraid.

31:12.889 --> 31:16.564
But you know what? Fear and love
cannot live in the same house.

31:17.369 --> 31:18.768
You're getting to her.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.440
It's because the people that we love

31:21.729 --> 31:23.606
eventually leave us.

31:23.769 --> 31:26.442
So we've given up on love.

31:28.489 --> 31:31.720
- You mean love's given up on me.
- No.

31:32.249 --> 31:36.879
It hasn't. It can't. Your fear of loss
has left you paralysed.

31:37.689 --> 31:40.761
Believe me, I know.
But you can change that.

31:40.929 --> 31:43.568
You can take the risk and love again.

31:44.209 --> 31:47.246
I mean, hey, they don't call it
lover's leap for nothing, right?

31:47.409 --> 31:49.127
- What?
- Actually, "lover's leap"

31:49.289 --> 31:50.802
was a reference to suicide, Phoebe.

31:53.049 --> 31:54.687
Let me rephrase that.

31:55.489 --> 32:00.165
Go to Max, push through
whatever hate or fear or doubt

32:00.329 --> 32:02.718
that you think might exist
between the both of you.

32:03.169 --> 32:04.648
Just tell him what's in your heart.

32:05.409 --> 32:07.445
- I love him.
- Then tell him that.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.681
Now, before it's too late.

32:12.409 --> 32:14.684
Who are you?

32:16.289 --> 32:18.598
Messengers.

32:19.369 --> 32:20.768
Thank you.

32:24.049 --> 32:25.607
I'm starting to feel better already.

32:26.689 --> 32:28.964
- You were good.
- I was good, wasn't I?

32:29.129 --> 32:30.403
Yes, ma'am.

32:30.969 --> 32:34.359
So why do I feel that was more
for my sake than for Cindy's?

32:34.609 --> 32:35.883
Because in order to let love in,

32:36.049 --> 32:38.563
you have to overcome the obstacles
within yourself.

32:39.409 --> 32:40.842
You know, we have to go reconnect

32:41.009 --> 32:43.239
Prue and Piper's love connection
before it's too late.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.599
You know that the more couples
we put back together,

32:45.769 --> 32:48.283
the more Drazi's gonna come
looking for me, wherever I am.

32:48.649 --> 32:51.163
- Isn't that the plan?
- Yeah.

32:51.369 --> 32:54.167
I just wanna make sure you know
what you're getting yourself into.

33:19.129 --> 33:20.960
They didn't have any roses.

33:21.409 --> 33:22.922
Cindy.

33:23.089 --> 33:25.284
I am so sorry
for whatever happened today.

33:25.849 --> 33:28.283
- I don't know what came over me.
- It's okay.

33:28.529 --> 33:31.248
It doesn't matter.
I didn't mean it either. None of it.

33:31.489 --> 33:32.968
- Really?
- Really.

33:40.329 --> 33:41.603
Cupid.

33:42.169 --> 33:44.729
You think you can undo
what I've done?

33:46.409 --> 33:47.888
You're dead.

33:55.129 --> 33:56.801
This better be good.

33:56.969 --> 33:58.687
Should I know
what you're talking about?

33:58.849 --> 34:01.079
Don't buy the innocent act.
She pulls it all the time.

34:01.249 --> 34:02.728
I beg your pardon?

34:02.929 --> 34:04.726
Just cut to the chase, Piper.
Why did you call?

34:04.889 --> 34:07.562
- What? I didn't...
- Prue, I wanna talk to you.

34:07.729 --> 34:10.038
Isn't this your number?
"Come to my house, ASAP"?

34:10.248 --> 34:12.319
Oh, that's really pathetic,
paging yourself.

34:12.529 --> 34:14.087
- Pathetic?
- Prue.

34:14.289 --> 34:16.518
- I'm sorry, I meant moronic.
- Why are you here?

34:16.688 --> 34:18.839
- You called.
- Oh, you wish.

34:19.049 --> 34:22.405
- What is going on?
- Hate. And it's gotta stop.

34:22.569 --> 34:24.799
I asked Jack and Dan
to come over here.

34:25.009 --> 34:26.328
And what is he still doing here?

34:26.489 --> 34:27.763
Trying to help you.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.243
No reason to hang around here.

34:29.409 --> 34:31.842
Oh, on the contrary.
Everyone on the couch. Now.

34:32.009 --> 34:35.159
- Just mind your own business.
- Hey, don't talk to my sister like that.

34:35.329 --> 34:37.922
- Please.
- Okay. Everyone on the couch, now.

34:39.009 --> 34:40.522
Come on.

34:52.929 --> 34:56.603
- Phoebe, I don't understand.
- Okay, well, be quiet and you will. Sit.

34:58.569 --> 35:00.161
You don't look okay.
Are you all right?

35:00.329 --> 35:02.797
- I'm having a rough day.
- Though we can change that.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.646
You are all acting

35:05.889 --> 35:08.767
- like you're under some kind of spell.
- Phoebe.

35:08.929 --> 35:11.489
Would you stop thinking
and just feel?

35:11.809 --> 35:14.562
Look, I know that some ugly things
were said tonight.

35:14.729 --> 35:18.119
- But you can get past that.
- Assuming that we want to.

35:18.289 --> 35:19.961
Prue, I know you want to.

35:20.129 --> 35:22.518
Remember how you felt
the first time you saw Jack?

35:22.689 --> 35:24.805
- How would you know?
- I hated him.

35:25.009 --> 35:27.842
My point exactly. Opposites attract.

35:28.329 --> 35:30.718
But after a while, he started
to make you smile, didn't he?

35:30.889 --> 35:34.643
He made you laugh.
Look at him again. Remember that.

35:48.289 --> 35:50.723
And, Piper, I watch you
when you talked to Dan.

35:50.889 --> 35:55.519
And I see light and warmth and hope.
And I know you feel that way.

35:55.769 --> 35:57.282
You still feel that way.

35:58.009 --> 36:00.523
And, Dan, you don't need someone
whispering in your ear,

36:00.689 --> 36:03.203
telling you not to trust Piper.
Trust yourself.

36:04.809 --> 36:06.640
I'm not saying
you have to tell me everything.

36:06.809 --> 36:08.640
But when you deliberately
keep secrets from me...

36:08.809 --> 36:12.404
It's not because I want to. I told you,
it just has nothing to do with you.

36:12.569 --> 36:14.207
But does it have
anything to do with Leo?

36:14.369 --> 36:17.918
No. It has to do with you and me
and what I would like us to become.

36:24.929 --> 36:26.203
It's working.

36:26.369 --> 36:28.599
- Where is he?
- He's close.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.482
Okay. Okay. Here's the plan.

36:30.649 --> 36:33.686
Jack, Dan, go down to the corner
market and get whatever you want.

36:33.849 --> 36:37.159
If the food of love
is Cheetos and soda, then play on.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.599
And can you pick up
a couple of frozen pizzas?

36:39.769 --> 36:41.248
So you want to talk?

36:41.729 --> 36:45.847
Yes. That's very good, Jack.
Very good. You're quick.

36:46.009 --> 36:47.727
- I'll drive.
- Yeah, okay.

36:47.889 --> 36:49.322
Take your time, don't hurry.

36:49.489 --> 36:50.922
Bye-bye.

36:51.649 --> 36:53.879
- Hey, what the hell is going on?
- Okay.

36:54.369 --> 36:56.041
Think, you guys.
Do you remember Drazi?

36:56.209 --> 36:57.722
He's still alive.
And if Cupid's right,

36:57.929 --> 37:00.318
he's on his way here as we speak.

37:00.489 --> 37:04.402
Whatever bad feelings you've had
for Dan and Jack, Drazi did it.

37:04.809 --> 37:07.039
He's twisted
your relationships with hate.

37:07.209 --> 37:10.724
- So, what do we do now?
- Exactly what you're doing right now.

37:10.889 --> 37:12.959
You let Dan and Jack
back into your hearts.

37:13.129 --> 37:15.962
- Okay, hold up. I don't love Jack.
- No, but you like him a lot.

37:16.649 --> 37:19.004
And it's helped
to make you open to love.

37:20.649 --> 37:22.082
Hello, lover boy.

37:24.769 --> 37:27.044
I should have finished you off
the first time.

37:27.729 --> 37:31.085
Okay, so much for loving him to death.
What do we do with him now?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.888
- Same thing, only different.
- Been there, blew that.

37:34.049 --> 37:38.486
Yeah, only difference is,
the ring won't be protecting him,

37:38.689 --> 37:41.487
it will be protecting him.

37:41.649 --> 37:44.038
- How can you be sure?
- I can't.

37:46.449 --> 37:49.566
But love is a risk.
If he's taught me anything, it's that.

37:58.969 --> 38:01.403
No. No.

38:02.049 --> 38:03.528
No. Not again.

38:11.009 --> 38:12.237
Is he gone this time?

38:12.449 --> 38:15.122
- Yeah, he's definitely gone.
- How do you know?

38:16.889 --> 38:18.322
Because I've never felt better.

38:21.089 --> 38:22.363
I knew you could do it.

38:23.809 --> 38:26.039
And now I have to go.

38:27.369 --> 38:29.200
- I know.
- I won't be far.

38:31.049 --> 38:33.802
Don't mourn me, Phoebe.
Remember me, celebrate me

38:34.129 --> 38:36.404
and seek me out.

38:56.929 --> 38:58.806
Now, that boy can kiss.

39:04.489 --> 39:07.208
You gotta remember, though,
the mission was successful.

39:07.369 --> 39:08.404
Bronson made it home.

39:08.689 --> 39:12.238
- Just in time to make Death Wish.
- Oh, no.

39:12.409 --> 39:14.286
You'll love it, I promise.

39:16.649 --> 39:19.880
Sorry, Phoebe. I almost forgot
to get our parking validated.

39:20.049 --> 39:22.358
- No problem, Kevin.
- Hey.

39:22.889 --> 39:25.562
You know, I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry

39:25.729 --> 39:27.481
that I cancelled on you
the other night.

39:28.929 --> 39:31.523
Love means never having
to say you're sorry.

39:32.009 --> 39:33.727
What?

39:33.889 --> 39:36.926
It's nothing. We saw Love Story
here the other night, and...

39:38.609 --> 39:40.725
- Never mind.
- I love that movie.

39:41.449 --> 39:42.962
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.208
Me too.

39:46.169 --> 39:48.205
Now.

39:52.009 --> 39:53.522
- Hi.
- Hello.

39:53.769 --> 39:56.727
Let's grab some coffee. I am buying.
