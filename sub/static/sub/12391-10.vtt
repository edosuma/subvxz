WEBVTT

00:07.610 --> 00:09.271
NO ONE EVER GETS
THEIR BALL BACK

00:09.320 --> 00:11.311
FROM MEAN
OLD MAN FULLER'S YARD.

00:11.350 --> 00:12.715
THIS SUCKS.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.288
I KNOW.

00:17.330 --> 00:22.131
WE WERE TIED 114 TO 114.
AND I WAS UP.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.730
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE PLAYING WITH MY NEW BALL.

00:24.780 --> 00:27.476
I'LL GIVE YOU 1,000 OUTS
IF YOU GO GET IT.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.442
2,000.

00:29.490 --> 00:33.153
DONE.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.690
OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.459
ALL RIGHT,
ALMOST GOT IT.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.296
THERE I GO--

00:37.340 --> 00:38.830
AH!

00:38.870 --> 00:39.837
OW.
GUS!

00:39.870 --> 00:41.474
SHAWN!
IS THE BALL ALL RIGHT?

00:41.510 --> 00:42.807
I CAN'T GET BACK OVER.

00:42.850 --> 00:43.839
(Old Man Fuller)
GET THAT BALL OFF MY GRASS!

00:43.880 --> 00:44.869
GET OUT OF MY YARD!

00:44.920 --> 00:47.457
GUS, I'M REALLY GONNA MISS YA.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.691
HO-HO-HO-HO!

00:50.730 --> 00:52.425
HO, BUZZ MCNAB.

00:52.470 --> 00:57.533
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRITS TOLD ME
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

00:57.580 --> 01:00.117
OH, MY GOODNESS,
A DAISY RED RYDER.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.883
I HAD ONE OF THESE
WHEN I WAS A KID.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.889
IT WAS THE REASON I WANTED
TO BECOME A POLICEMAN.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.421
WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS
FROM ME AND GUS.

01:06.460 --> 01:09.634
THAN KS, GUYS.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.830
HE'S GONNA SHOOT HIS EYE OUT.

01:10.870 --> 01:11.700
YES, HE IS.

01:11.740 --> 01:14.504
THAT WAS AMAZING.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

01:14.550 --> 01:16.814
UH, THE ROOM WHERE I TAKE NAPS
SHARES A VENT

01:16.850 --> 01:20.718
WITH THE ROOM WHERE THEY DO
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALS.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.399
AH!

01:23.430 --> 01:24.624
LASSIE!

01:28.000 --> 01:29.308
I-I HATE SNOW GLOBES.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.773
NOW, THAT'S STRANGE.

01:30.810 --> 01:33.745
MY PSYCHIC SENSES TOLD ME
SPECIFICALLY THAT SNOW GLOBES

01:33.780 --> 01:34.974
DIDN'T GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES

01:35.020 --> 01:36.556
ABOUT BEING TRAPPED
IN A CLEAR BALL WITH SNOW

01:36.590 --> 01:37.386
THAT BURNS YOUR SKIN OFF.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.590
WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS
FROM ME AND GUS.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.269
UH.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.449
MR. MI'I'I'ENS SAYS IT FELT
JUST LIKE GOING TO SLEEP,

01:49.480 --> 01:51.619
AND HE DOESN'T HOLD IT
AGAINST YOU AT ALL.

01:51.650 --> 01:54.881
KITI'Y HEAVEN...
IT'S JUST LIKE EAST BEACH.

01:54.930 --> 01:56.955
THAT IS THE BEST NEWS EVER.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.695
MERRY CHRISTMAS
FROM BOTH OF--

01:58.730 --> 02:01.506
WHOA, WHOA,
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL GIFI'.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.508
IT'S CLEARLY JUST FROM ME.
DON'T APPROPRIATE.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.529
NOT AT CHRISTMAS TIME.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.673
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SHAWN.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.971
'TIS THE SEASON, JULES.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.317
WOW!

02:09.350 --> 02:10.351
[laughs]

02:10.390 --> 02:11.357
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED

02:11.390 --> 02:12.482
TO GET INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT

02:12.530 --> 02:13.997
BEFORE MY FAMILY ARRIVES.

02:14.030 --> 02:16.533
OH, SHOULD I MEET THEM,
OR IS IT TOO SOON?

02:16.570 --> 02:19.505
(Juliet and Bruce)
TOO SOON FOR WHAT?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.576
NOTHING.

02:21.610 --> 02:22.804
O'HARE FAMILY CHRISTMAS, HUH?

02:22.850 --> 02:25.842
MY FAMILY CHRISTMASES
ARE THE BEST.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.484
WE HAVE TRADITIONAL
SCOTTISH GAMES

02:28.530 --> 02:30.088
AND MUSIC AND CRAFTS.

02:30.130 --> 02:31.859
YOU GUYS SHOULD TOTALLY
COME BY TONIGHT IF YOU'D LIKE.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.801
I DO LOVE A SCOTTISH CRAFI'.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.570
BUT, UH, MY FATHER
AND I HAVE BEEN INVITED OVER

02:37.610 --> 02:39.840
TO THE GUSTERS FOR
AN OLD-FASHIONED HOLIDAY DINNER.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.972
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.113
I CAN THINK OF SOMEONE
WHO COULD USE

02:43.150 --> 02:44.583
A LITTLE CHEER
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.723
RECENTLY DIVORCED.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.749
SEPARATED.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.051
ESTRANGED?

02:48.100 --> 02:49.067
EMBATI'LED?

02:49.100 --> 02:50.897
YES.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.430
AND ALL ALONE
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

02:52.470 --> 02:53.437
[startled yell]

02:53.480 --> 02:55.505
ALL RIGHT!

02:55.550 --> 02:56.915
WHO KEEPS TELLING PEOPLE

02:56.950 --> 02:58.076
I WANT SNOW GLOBES
FOR CHRISTMAS?

03:04.660 --> 03:07.595
DUDE, I AM REALLY STOKED.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.937
IN OVER 20 YEARS
OF FRIENDSHIP, I CAN COUNT

03:08.970 --> 03:10.733
ON ONE SHOP TEACHER'S HAND,
THE NUMBER OF TIMES

03:10.780 --> 03:12.645
YOUR FOLKS HAVE HAD US OVER.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.614
I ASSUME IT'S BECAUSE
THEY CAN'T STAND MY FATHER.

03:14.650 --> 03:15.719
UNDERSTANDABLY.

03:15.750 --> 03:16.910
WELL, I WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY SAY THAT.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.019
WHAT WOULD
YOU SAY NECESSARILY?

03:19.060 --> 03:20.948
LET'S JUST SAY IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF YOUR DAD.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.197
YOUR HOUSE IS TOO SMALL?
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EXTRA CHAIRS?

03:24.240 --> 03:26.435
NO.
HIDING A JEWISH FAMILY
IN YOUR ATTIC?

03:26.480 --> 03:27.731
NO.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.771
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.880
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.218
GUS?

03:34.260 --> 03:35.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

03:35.790 --> 03:36.996
I FEEL LIKE PEPE LE PEW

03:37.030 --> 03:38.793
WHEN HE LOOKED UP PEW
IN THE DICTIONARY.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.661
[with French accent]
LE PEW. WHUH?

03:40.700 --> 03:41.837
NO.

03:41.870 --> 03:44.009
MY PARENTS ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE A BAD INFLUENCE ON ME.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.007
UNDERSTANDABLY.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.018
A BAD INFLUENCE?
YES.

03:47.050 --> 03:48.517
DUDE, THAT'S ABSURD.
REALLY?

03:48.550 --> 03:50.211
BECAUSE OF YOU, SHAWN,
I GOT MY FIRST "B,"

03:50.260 --> 03:52.148
BROKE MY FIRST CURFEW,

03:52.190 --> 03:53.851
ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
THE STATE BIRD--

03:53.900 --> 03:55.094
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
HE COULDN'T HOLD HIS OWN LIQUOR?

03:55.130 --> 03:57.166
NOW I KNOW WHAT TO GET
YOUR PARENTS FOR CHRISTMAS.
WHAT?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.667
I'M GONNA LEAD 'EM ON A WALK

03:58.710 --> 04:00.473
DOWN MEMORY LANE,
AND GIVE THEM THE GIFT OF SEEING

04:00.480 --> 04:05.247
WHAT A POSITIVE INFLUENCE
I HAVE BEEN ON THEIR SON.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.126
DAD, WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON GETTING A REAL TREE?

04:09.160 --> 04:11.560
YOU PROBABLY CHOPPED DOWN
SOME POOR ANIMAL'S HOME.

04:11.600 --> 04:16.208
YEAH, THAT'S THE VICIOUS
LITTLE BASTARD RIGHT THERE.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.571
CAN WE GO, PLEASE?

04:17.610 --> 04:18.838
WHOA, SHAWN, SHAWN?

04:18.880 --> 04:20.541
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA BE LATE
TO THE GUSTERS.

04:20.580 --> 04:21.842
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS DINNER
GO WELL.

04:21.890 --> 04:22.845
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING?

04:22.890 --> 04:24.915
YOUR GIl-T.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.689
GO ON.

04:26.730 --> 04:27.856
SHAKE IT, RATTLE IT,
FEEL IT, SNIFF IT.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.662
DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT
WITH IT

04:28.700 --> 04:30.634
BEFORE IT GOES
IN THAT STOCKING.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.934
THEN YOU GOT ONE WEEK TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT IT IS.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.335
DAD, THIS RIDICULOUS COMPETITION
MEANS WAY MORE

04:34.380 --> 04:35.540
TO YOU THAN IT DOES TO ME.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.775
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVEN'T WON SINCE
YOU WERE EIGHT-YEARS-OLD.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.084
CHRISTMAS '92 WAS A DRAW.
YOU KNOW THAT.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.554
OH, SO YOU DO CARE.
GO ON.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.229
THAT'S IT.

04:49.270 --> 04:50.669
THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE SURE?

04:50.710 --> 04:52.302
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

04:52.350 --> 04:53.977
OH, HERE'S YOURS.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.352
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

04:56.390 --> 04:59.882
[chuckles]

05:01.900 --> 05:04.061
[laughs]
YOU ARE NEVER--

05:04.100 --> 05:06.239
SHH.
WAIT-WAIT-WAIT.

05:06.270 --> 05:08.841
ALL RIGHT, TIME'S UP.
IN THE STOCKINGS THEY GO.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.986
I'M GONNA FIGURE IT OUT, SHAWN.
I ALWAYS DO.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.908
[sighs]

05:13.960 --> 05:17.054
(both)
SAME TIME.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.031
OH, I THINK THERE'S A SURPRISE
IN HERE FOR SOMEONE.

05:23.070 --> 05:23.968
I'M GROWN.

05:24.010 --> 05:25.102
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS EVERY YEAR.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.038
WE HEAR YOU, SON,
WE HEAR YA.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.958
AND WE'RE SURE YOU'RE VERY HAPPY
STILL BEING A SALES REP.

05:29.990 --> 05:30.979
IAM.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.420
PHARMACEUTICAL SALES
IS A VERY DESIRABLE FIELD.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.928
OF COURSE, AND YOU'RE DOING
VERY WELL FOR YOURSELF.

05:35.970 --> 05:39.064
THAT'S $100, BOY.

05:39.110 --> 05:42.079
NO.
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

05:42.110 --> 05:43.042
TURKEY'S READY!

05:43.080 --> 05:44.069
(Henry)
FINALLY!

05:44.120 --> 05:44.882
(Bill)
IT SMELLS GOOD, WINNIE.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.252
WHY SMELL IT
WHEN YOU CAN TASTE IT?

05:47.290 --> 05:49.485
SPEAKING
OF SMOKED TURKEY,

05:49.530 --> 05:51.327
YOU KNOW WHY GUS
ISN'T A SMOKER?

05:51.370 --> 05:52.962
'CAUSE WHEN WE WERE KIDS
I MADE HIM SMOKE

05:53.000 --> 05:53.932
AN ENTIRE PACK OF CIGARETTES,

05:53.970 --> 05:56.006
AND HE DISCOVERED
HE HATED THE TASTE.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.372
PRETTY GOOD INFLUENCE
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

05:58.410 --> 05:59.775
PROBABLY WHAT GAVE HIM ASTHMA.

05:59.820 --> 06:00.718
PROBABLY WHAT STUNTED

06:00.720 --> 06:01.880
HIS GROWTH TOO.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.909
I'M FIVE-TEN-AND-A-HALF.

06:02.950 --> 06:04.986
WE HEAR YOU, SON.
WE HEAR YA.

06:05.020 --> 06:05.918
GUS, YOU'RE TALL ENOUGH.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.427
SHAWN, YOU'RE AN IDIOT,
AND TO BE FAIR,

06:07.460 --> 06:09.018
THERE'S A LOT OF
COMPLICATED CAUSES FOR ASTHMA.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.038
NOW, LET'S EAT.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.139
YOU KNOW, IT WAS ACTUALLY GUS'
ASTHMA MEDICATION

06:12.170 --> 06:14.331
THAT FIRST INTERESTED HIM
IN PHARMACEUTICALS.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.019
SO YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THAT.

06:17.050 --> 06:18.984
YOU MADE YOUR POINT, SHAWN.
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.487
YES, YOU'RE VERY CLOSE.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.988
SO CLOSE, I WONDER
IF HE WOULDN'T BE MARRIED BY NOW

06:23.030 --> 06:24.895
IF HE WASN'T SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME

06:24.930 --> 06:27.091
WITH YOU.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.301
TRUST ME.
I GET MINE.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.876
I MEAN--

06:30.910 --> 06:32.070
I'M JUST WAITING
FOR MRS. RIGHT.

06:32.110 --> 06:33.145
WE AT LEAST THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE

06:33.180 --> 06:34.078
A HOUSE BY NOW.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.008
I HAVE TIME.
THE MARKET'S STILL COOLING OFF.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.278
YEAH.
SO'S THE FOOD.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.218
YOU WON'T HAVE TIME

06:38.260 --> 06:40.057
IF YOU KEEP USING
ALL YOUR EXTRA ENERGY

06:40.090 --> 06:42.069
WITH THIS GYPSY
DETECTIVE AGENCY NONSENSE

06:42.100 --> 06:43.499
YOU TWO HAVE COOKED UP.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.031
[laughs]
MRS. G.

06:45.070 --> 06:48.176
IT'S A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE AGENCY.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.541
PSYCH.

06:49.580 --> 06:52.219
AND HOW DOES THIS DIFFER
FROM THAT PET BAPTISM BUSINESS

06:52.250 --> 06:53.217
YOU HAD AS KIDS?

06:53.250 --> 06:54.615
FIRST OF ALL,
THAT WAS AN LLC.

06:54.660 --> 06:56.184
AND I'M THE ONE

06:56.230 --> 06:57.925
THAT LET GUS BELIEVE
THAT JESUS WAS BLACK.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.166
THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE GROW--

06:59.200 --> 07:00.224
GROWING UP,
WHICH OF COURSE HE IS.

07:00.270 --> 07:02.158
HE IS THAT.

07:02.210 --> 07:04.337
THAT--HE IS THAT.

07:06.650 --> 07:08.242
I SAY WE SKIP
OLD MAN FULLER'S HOUSE.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.885
NOBODY WANTS TO SING
TO HIS OLD, MEAN BEHIND.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.888
CAN'T HEAR THE SONG
OVER HIS CUSSING ANYWAY.

07:12.930 --> 07:15.660
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS!

07:15.700 --> 07:17.258
WE'RE ALL ADULTS NOW.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.109
CAN'T WE LET BYGONES BE BYGONES?

07:19.140 --> 07:22.598
EVEN OLD MAN FULLER
CAN USE SOME CHRISTMAS SPIRIT!

07:22.650 --> 07:23.947
COME ON!

07:23.980 --> 07:26.289
* WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS *

07:26.320 --> 07:28.288
* WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS *

07:28.320 --> 07:30.493
* WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS *

07:30.530 --> 07:32.020
* AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR

07:32.070 --> 07:33.298
MR. FULLER!

07:33.330 --> 07:34.467
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWING
ROCKS AT US BY NOW

07:34.500 --> 07:36.229
IF HE WERE HERE.

07:36.270 --> 07:40.343
* WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS
AND A HAPPY NEW-- *

07:40.380 --> 07:42.245
[carolers all scream]

07:49.370 --> 07:50.359
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

07:50.400 --> 07:52.129
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:52.170 --> 07:53.432
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

07:53.480 --> 07:55.175
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:55.210 --> 07:57.314
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

07:57.350 --> 07:59.318
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:59.350 --> 08:00.385
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

08:00.420 --> 08:02.229
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

08:02.260 --> 08:04.558
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

08:04.600 --> 08:07.592
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

08:15.590 --> 08:16.682
YEAH, IT'S
AN APPARENT SUICIDE,

08:16.720 --> 08:18.654
BUT, UH, WE'RE STILL WORKING
THE SCENE.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.365
DUDE, WHAT IF
THIS WASN'T SUICIDE?

08:42.410 --> 08:44.298
WHAT IF THIS WAS MURDER?

08:44.340 --> 08:45.671
SHAWN, IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME.

08:45.710 --> 08:47.177
CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE WORK
AT THE OFFICE?

08:47.220 --> 08:48.278
THEY'VE ALREADY MOVED ON.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.639
LOOK, THERE IS NO WAY

08:49.690 --> 08:51.453
THAT AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN
IN FULLER'S CONDITION

08:51.490 --> 08:52.457
COULD HAVE HOISTED HIMSELF

08:52.490 --> 08:54.094
OVER THAT BANNISTER.

08:54.130 --> 08:56.121
AND CHECK IT OUT.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.536
HE WAS CLEARLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO WATCHING SOME TV TONIGHT.

08:58.570 --> 09:01.073
WHILE HE ATE HIS LOBSTER.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.298
YOU MAY BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

09:03.350 --> 09:05.887
PLUS, I PSYCH IT UP NICE
FOR YOUR PARENTS,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.558
THEY MIGHT BE IMPRESSED,
YOU KNOW?

09:07.590 --> 09:10.127
THROW IN A LITTLE RAZZLE DAZZLE.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.696
MAYBE THEY REALIZE I'M NOT SUCH
A BAD INFLUENCE Al-TER ALL.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.869
WHICH MAY GET THEM OFF MY CASE
FOR DECIDING

09:13.900 --> 09:15.333
TO GO INTO BUSINESS WITH YOU.

09:15.370 --> 09:18.168
NOW YOU'RE FEELING ME,
YOU CONVERTIBLE LEBARON.

09:18.210 --> 09:20.246
ARE YOU GUYS COMING OR WHAT?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.317
SURE THING, POP.

09:23.350 --> 09:25.784
WHOA-WHOA!
STOP!

09:25.830 --> 09:27.457
[sighs]
I'M SENSING SOMETHING.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.230
WHAT IS IT, SHAWN?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.703
IS IT LIKE THE OTHER
26 AND A HALF CRIMES

09:31.740 --> 09:33.799
WE SOLVED
FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT?

09:33.840 --> 09:37.549
I'M SENSING A STRUGGLE.

09:37.580 --> 09:40.310
[imitating strained voice]
OH!

09:40.360 --> 09:41.349
OH, PLEASE!

09:41.390 --> 09:44.257
OH!

09:44.300 --> 09:45.722
FULLER'S UNCONSCIOUS.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.237
NO, HE WAS
JUST AN OLD MAN

09:47.270 --> 09:49.261
WITH A LITTLE SOl-T SKULL.

09:51.710 --> 09:53.871
OH, SOMEONE'S WRAPPING A ROPE
AROUND HIS NECK!

09:53.910 --> 09:56.879
WHAT I'M SENSING HERE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

09:56.920 --> 09:58.729
IS MURDER.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.694
SPENCER, OLD PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

10:00.730 --> 10:02.266
OFFING THEMSELVES
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.689
WELL, ACCORDING TO CSU,
SHAWN MIGHT BE RIGHT.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.264
COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY?

10:06.310 --> 10:07.004
CRIME SCENE UNIT.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.530
THEM TOO.

10:08.580 --> 10:09.842
LET ME SEE THAT.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.347
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA,
SIGNS OF STRUGGLE.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.644
MY LORD.

10:13.690 --> 10:14.816
HE REALLY IS PSYCHIC.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.555
MAYBE WE WERE WRONG

10:16.590 --> 10:17.796
ABOUT THE BOYS WORKING
TOGETHER...

10:17.830 --> 10:20.025
THIS TIME.

10:20.070 --> 10:20.866
RIGHT.
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.333
IT'S AN OPEN CRIME SCENE,
PEOPLE,

10:22.370 --> 10:23.462
I NEED WITNESS STATEMENTS

10:23.510 --> 10:25.671
FROM EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF YOU CAROLERS.

10:25.710 --> 10:26.938
CRAP, I'M RUNNING LATE.

10:26.980 --> 10:29.949
LASSIE, COME ON, MAN.
HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.617
GUS AND I WILL TAKE 'EM DOWN
TO THE STATION TOMORROW.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.355
WE HAVE PASSES--

10:33.390 --> 10:34.789
WHICH PRACTICALLY
MAKES US CO-WORKERS.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.388
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BIG L?

10:36.430 --> 10:39.900
[screams]

10:39.940 --> 10:42.977
[deep voice]
THAT HURT, MAN!

10:43.010 --> 10:45.547
BUT WHEN THEY CUT US,
WE BLEED BLUE.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.966
CARLTON!

10:52.000 --> 10:53.490
HI!

10:53.530 --> 10:57.375
I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT!

10:57.410 --> 10:58.900
I HOPE YOU'RE
IN A HOGMANAY MOOD.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.941
I DOUBT IT.
WHATEVER THAT IS.

11:00.980 --> 11:02.379
THE FIRST FOOTER!

11:02.420 --> 11:05.389
[all cheer]

11:05.420 --> 11:06.921
OH, THE FIRST FOOTER,

11:06.960 --> 11:08.928
IT'S SCOTTISH TRADITION
TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST VISITOR

11:08.970 --> 11:09.925
OF THE HOLIDAYS.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.768
YOU.

11:12.810 --> 11:15.028
WHY ARE THEY ALL

11:15.080 --> 11:15.944
STARING AT ME?

11:15.980 --> 11:18.517
WELL, THE FIRST FOOTER
TRADITIONALLY BRINGS

11:18.550 --> 11:21.053
A GIFT OF FOOD.

11:21.090 --> 11:24.150
ALL I'VE GOT IS
A CLIFF BAR IN MY CAR.

11:24.190 --> 11:27.034
I'D REALLY PREFER
TO SAVE IT FOR MY MORNING RUN.

11:27.070 --> 11:29.959
SO THESE ARE MY NEPHEWS.

11:30.010 --> 11:31.830
DRAKE, FINN, AND ISAAC.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.871
BOYS, THIS IS
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.911
HE WORKS
WITH AUNTIE JULIE.

11:37.790 --> 11:39.189
I LIKE IT BETTER
IN HERE ALREADY.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.097
I WAS HELPING THEM
WITH THEIR CHRISTMAS CRAFTS.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.995
IT'S ALWAYS MY FAVORITE PART.

11:43.030 --> 11:43.997
LOOK AT THIS,
AUNTIE JULIE!

11:44.040 --> 11:44.995
LOOK AT MINE!

11:45.040 --> 11:46.029
OH, MY GOODNESS.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.038
[all yelling for attention]

11:48.080 --> 11:49.707
THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC,
BUT YOU KNOW,

11:49.750 --> 11:53.743
MAYBE DETECTIVE LASSITER
WOULD LIKE TO HELP OUT.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.224
SURE.

11:56.260 --> 12:00.026
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
WHAT DO WE GOT GOING ON HERE?

12:00.070 --> 12:01.139
WELL, YOU KNOW, DRAKE,

12:01.170 --> 12:03.058
TECHNICALLY JESUS WAS BORN
AROUND APRIL,

12:03.110 --> 12:06.102
SO WE NEED TO GET RID
OF THIS WINTER FOLIAGE.

12:06.150 --> 12:09.210
OH, AND, FINN,
THE WORD MANGER ACTUALLY REFERS

12:09.250 --> 12:11.514
TO THE WOODEN FEEDING TROUGH
THAT THE ANIMALS USED,

12:11.560 --> 12:16.259
SO LET'S PUT BABY JESUS
IN THIS LITTLE SHOT GLASS.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.597
UH...
PERFECT.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.493
CARLTON--

12:18.540 --> 12:20.030
WELL, YOU KNOW,
BASED ON HOW FAR THEY HAD

12:20.070 --> 12:21.879
TO TRAVEL,
ALL THE EXPERTS AGREE

12:21.910 --> 12:23.969
THAT THE WISE MEN DIDN'T REALLY
GET THERE UNTIL JESUS WAS TWO,

12:24.020 --> 12:25.544
SO LET'S GET RID OF THEM.

12:25.590 --> 12:26.887
UH, UH, CARLTON.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.581
REMEMBER,
THIS IS FOR THE CHILDREN.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.258
RIGHT.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.064
LET'S DO ONE
WITH SANTA IN IT.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.067
OH!

12:33.100 --> 12:34.636
HAND ME KRIS KRINGLE
THERE, GUYS.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.308
(Juliet)
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

12:36.340 --> 12:39.571
YOU KNOW, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,
THE DUTCH VERSION OF SANTA

12:39.610 --> 12:42.283
USED SLAVES
TO DELIVER THE TOYS.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.791
[knocks on door]
YO!

12:48.830 --> 12:51.196
WE'RE HERE TO GIVE OUR OFFICIAL
STATEMENTS FOR THE FULLER CASE.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.731
YES.
ABOUT THAT.

12:53.770 --> 12:59.117
UM, OUR INVESTIGATION HAS
CONFIRMED MR. SPENCER'S HUNCHES.

12:59.150 --> 13:01.311
AH, REALLY?

13:01.360 --> 13:01.553
IT WAS MURDER.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.983
THAT'S 27 AND COUNTING.

13:04.030 --> 13:06.123
DO YOU FOLKS MIND COMING ON IN
FOR A MOMENT?

13:06.170 --> 13:07.137
JUST HAVE A SEAT.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.206
MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.846
CHAIR'S RIGHT
OVER THERE.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.347
I THOUGHT WE COULD, UH,
HAVE MORE PRIVACY THIS WAY.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.348
WHY?
WHAT, IS THERE A PROBLEM?

13:16.390 --> 13:17.880
WELL, THIS REPORT SAYS
THAT THERE WERE TRACES

13:17.920 --> 13:19.387
OF WEED KILLER FOUND
IN MR. FULLER'S SYSTEM.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.696
POISON.
I SENSED THAT AS WELL.

13:22.730 --> 13:24.698
THERE'S JUST
ONE SLIGHT PROBLEM,

13:24.740 --> 13:26.207
WE FOUND A BOX OF THE SAME TYPE
OF WEED KILLER

13:26.240 --> 13:28.299
ON MR. GUSTER'S PROPERTY.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.672
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

13:30.720 --> 13:32.187
WHOA, WHOA, NOW.
SLOW YOUR ROLL.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.414
I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

13:33.450 --> 13:35.008
ME AND FULLER HAD
A LONG-TIME FEUD

13:35.060 --> 13:36.357
ABOUT THE PROPERTY LINE.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.654
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
I'D POISON HIS SHRUBS

13:38.700 --> 13:40.895
BECAUSE HE REFUSED
TO CUT THEM BACK.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.965
BILL, THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

13:43.010 --> 13:43.999
HOW ABOUT THIS?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.132
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD
OF THE DECEASED

13:45.180 --> 13:47.740
WAS DONE CAUSED BY A BLOODY
HAMMER FOUND NEARBY

13:47.780 --> 13:51.716
WITH PRINTS BELONGING
TO A MR. WILLIAM GUSTER.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.318
YEAH, BUT IF YOU'D LOOKED
A LITTLE CLOSER,

13:53.360 --> 13:54.952
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND
A HACKSAW AND A PICKAXE

13:55.000 --> 13:56.319
WITH MY PRINTS
ON THEM TOO.

13:56.370 --> 13:58.736
FULLER HAD BEEN TAKING
MY TOOLS FOR YEARS.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.032
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON
WE'D BEEN FEUDING.

14:00.070 --> 14:02.868
ANOTHER PERFECT LY
REASONABLE EXPLANATION.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.878
JUST ONE MORE THING,

14:04.920 --> 14:06.911
THE ROPE USED
TO HANG MR. FULLER

14:06.960 --> 14:09.781
MATCHES ROPE
FROM A BOAT BELONGING TO--

14:09.830 --> 14:11.991
[laughs]
LEMME GUESS. ME.

14:12.030 --> 14:13.327
[laughter]

14:13.370 --> 14:14.496
(Gus)
DAD, YOU'RE CRAZY.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.837
(Shawn)
MR. G.

14:15.870 --> 14:18.202
WAIT.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.332
YOU MEAN
IT REALLY WAS MINE?

14:19.380 --> 14:21.348
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

14:21.380 --> 14:23.780
LOOK, I JUST SAID THAT
TO BE FUNNY.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.481
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IT GOT THERE.

14:25.520 --> 14:29.126
I AM SORRY, MR. GUSTER,
THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG ENOUGH.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.468
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.968
WHAT?
YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY

14:33.010 --> 14:34.375
YOU CAN'T ARREST ME!
AND WILL BE USED
AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.

14:34.410 --> 14:35.536
I'M A DEACON IN A CHURCH!

14:35.580 --> 14:36.547
YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.788
WHAT IS
THE LORD GONNA SAY?

14:43.830 --> 14:44.922
IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU
TO INVITE US OVER.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.825
OH, WINNIE, IT'S
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

14:46.870 --> 14:48.462
NOW WHEN IS BILL
GONNA BE RELEASED FROM CUSTODY?

14:48.500 --> 14:49.535
SOON I HOPE.

14:49.570 --> 14:52.175
A THING LIKE THIS
COULD BE DEVASTATING TO SOMEBODY

14:52.210 --> 14:55.543
WITH DELICATE HEALTH,
A WEAK DISPOSITION.

14:55.580 --> 14:58.378
WE'RE GONNA GET DAD OUT BEFORE
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TO HIM.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.957
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.059
YOUR FATHER'S STRONG AS AN OX,
BUT YOU,

15:03.100 --> 15:07.503
LORD KNOWS YOU HAVE ENOUGH
STRESS TO DEAL WITH AS IT IS.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.442
MRS. G., YOU HAVE MY WORD,
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.447
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS CASE.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.584
YEAH.

15:14.620 --> 15:18.090
SHAWN, MAYBE WE OUGHTA GET
SOME FOOD TOGETHER HERE.

15:18.130 --> 15:20.928
MAYBE YOU OUGHTA PASS
ON THIS ONE.

15:20.970 --> 15:21.789
(Shawn)
I CAN'T, DAD.
I OWE IT TO THEM.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.400
LOOK, THE GUSTERS
ARE NICE PEOPLE, OKAY?

15:24.440 --> 15:26.169
THEY INVITE YOU OVER
FOR DINNER AT 6:00.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.643
THEY DON'T SERVE TILL 6:30.
SO WHAT?

15:27.680 --> 15:29.511
THE POINT IS,
AS A RULE,

15:29.550 --> 15:30.881
YOU NEVER WANNA GET INVOLVED
IN A CASE

15:30.920 --> 15:33.252
WHERE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
ARE INVOLVED.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.032
DAD, I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.173
WHAT IF GUS'S DAD IS GUILTY?
HUH?

15:43.210 --> 15:44.643
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
HOW COULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT?

15:44.680 --> 15:46.511
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
RIGHT THERE, SHAWN.

15:46.550 --> 15:47.983
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE
YOUR DECISION IRRESPECT IVE

15:48.020 --> 15:48.816
OF THE FACTS.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.351
YOU HAVE ALREADY COMPROMISED
THIS CASE.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.992
COMPROMISED?
WHY?

15:53.030 --> 15:53.997
BECAUSE I'M NOT AFRAID
OF MY OWN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT?

15:54.040 --> 15:56.031
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I VIEW THAT AS A TOOL

15:56.070 --> 15:58.038
IN MY PROBLEM-SOLVING,
NOT A LIABILITY.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.945
IT IS THAT EXACT KIND
OF LAME-ASS THINKING--

15:59.980 --> 16:01.379
I CAN SEE WHY
YOU WERE NEVER A DETECTIVE.

16:01.420 --> 16:06.084
AND I CAN SEE WHY YOU ENDED UP
A DIVORCED DETECTIVE.

16:06.130 --> 16:10.328
MY GOD.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.736
WE WENT ALMOST THREE HOURS
WITHOUT HAVING AN ARGUMENT. HMM.

16:12.770 --> 16:17.013
IT'S OUR BEST HOLIDAY
IN YEARS, HUH?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.113
OH!

16:21.160 --> 16:23.219
UH, I WAS JUST ARRESTING SOMEONE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.079
I THOUGHT I'D DROP BY
AND SAY HI.

16:24.130 --> 16:29.090
OH, YOU KNOW, WE JUST SAT DOWN
TO LUNCH,

16:29.140 --> 16:30.459
SO...

16:30.510 --> 16:31.602
SORRY.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.607
HEY, GUYS.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.208
LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.047
A WII!

16:36.090 --> 16:37.182
WHOA!

16:37.220 --> 16:40.087
AWESOME!

16:40.130 --> 16:41.449
WOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY
VERY THOUGHTFUL.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.455
THANK YOU.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.626
IT TURNED UP
IN A SWEEP.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.694
I MEAN, THEY'RE WELCOME
TO USE IT,

16:44.730 --> 16:47.733
BUT TECHNICALLY IT BELONGS
TO THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

16:47.780 --> 16:49.372
COME ON!
LET'S PLAY BOXING!

16:49.410 --> 16:51.776
YOU'RE NOT BUSY?

16:51.820 --> 16:54.482
NO, NO.
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.189
(Lassiter)
OH, OH, DRAKE,
YOU'RE TOO SLOW, MY FRIEND!

17:00.230 --> 17:02.039
YOU BETTER CHANGE YOUR NAME
TO LASSITER BECAUSE I OWN YOU!

17:02.040 --> 17:03.337
OH, OH, OH!

17:03.370 --> 17:08.717
OH, HE'S DOWN ON THE GROUND!

17:08.750 --> 17:10.081
WHAT A LAME-O.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.382
COME ON.
WHO'S NEXT?

17:11.420 --> 17:12.557
WHO'S NEXT?
COME ON!

17:12.590 --> 17:14.126
LET'S GO!

17:14.160 --> 17:15.127
SOMEBODY COME GET SOME!
WHO'S NEXT?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.139
GET SOME!
COME ON!

17:20.170 --> 17:22.104
YOU GUYS SURE YOU DON'T WANNA
TAKE A SANDWICH OR ANYTHING

17:22.150 --> 17:23.208
FOR THE ROAD?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.877
YOU HARDLY ATE ANY
OF YOUR FOOD.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.253
OOH, I REMEMBER ONCE WHEN WE
WERE LITTLE YOU MADE US

17:27.290 --> 17:28.109
THESE CHICKEN CORDON BLEUS.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.127
SHAWN.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.354
BUT THE HAM WAS SO THIN--

17:30.390 --> 17:32.290
SHAWN!

17:32.330 --> 17:33.490
WE DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.191
ALL WE CAN THINK
ABOUT IS CLEARING DAD'S NAME

17:35.240 --> 17:37.435
AND GETTING HIM
OUT OF JAIL.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.246
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
AS SOON AS WE HAVE ANY LEADS.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.714
[cell phone rings]

17:42.750 --> 17:45.287
DAD.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.720
NO, IT IS NOT AN ENGRAVED SET
OF RUBBER BULLETS.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.727
WHY WOULD I POSSIBLY GIVE YOU

17:48.760 --> 17:50.466
ANOTHER EXCUSE
TO SHOOT A GUN?

17:50.500 --> 17:53.298
WELL, YOU BETTER
KEEP THINKING.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.275
SHAWN, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
HOW IMPORTANT THIS CASE IS.

17:56.310 --> 18:00.747
SO WHATEVER YOU NEED,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.155
(Shawn)
HOLD UP, HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.354
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

18:03.390 --> 18:06.462
GIVE ME A SECOND.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.331
IS IT A CLUE
THAT CLEARS MY DAD?

18:08.370 --> 18:09.860
CAN YOU SHUSH FOR ONE SECOND?

18:09.900 --> 18:11.333
I KNOW YOU THINK
THIS IS EASY FOR ME,

18:11.380 --> 18:13.541
BUT I DO GO
THROUGH A MENTAL PROCESS.

18:13.580 --> 18:16.219
LIKE A EQUALS B.
B EQUALS C.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.888
WHICH MEANS A EQUALS--
WOULD YOU STOP IT?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.319
THAT'S TOO CLOSE!

18:19.360 --> 18:21.521
NOW I GOTTA START
ALL OVER.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.337
DAMN IT, SHAWN,

18:25.370 --> 18:26.337
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
OKAY!

18:26.370 --> 18:27.530
ALL RIGHT!

18:27.580 --> 18:30.799
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE
WAS A HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.611
AH, MR. MITCHELL.

18:35.660 --> 18:36.627
YES.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.322
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

18:39.370 --> 18:40.894
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN ANY FAKE VACATION PACKAGES.

18:40.930 --> 18:42.864
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

18:42.910 --> 18:45.401
SO I CAN CLAIM THE GRAND PRIZE,
AND I'M NOT PAYING

18:45.440 --> 18:46.976
FOR ANY DAMN SUBSCRIPTIONS
FOR MAGAZINES

18:47.010 --> 18:48.011
THAT I KNOW
I'LL NEVER SEE.

18:51.860 --> 18:54.795
I'M THE HEAD PSYCHIC FOR THE
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.432
OH.
WELL, COME ON IN THEN.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.714
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE DEATH OF MR. FULLER.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.625
AND I AM SENSING
SOME UNRESOLVED CONFLICT

19:10.660 --> 19:11.991
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

19:12.030 --> 19:15.033
SOMETHING--SOMETHING TO DO
WITH RULES AND VIOLATIONS.

19:15.070 --> 19:15.889
YES, IT'S TRUE.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.101
FULLER BECAME A CONSTANT THORN
IN MY SIDE

19:18.140 --> 19:20.347
EVER SINCE I STARTED
THE HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.712
HE REFUSED
TO FOLLOW THE ORDINANCES.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.445
WHEN I'D GIVE HIM CITATIONS,

19:24.490 --> 19:26.958
HE'D TEAR THEM UP AND THROW THEM
IN THE TRASH.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.355
SO I'D GIVE HIM
ANOTHER CITATION.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.119
IT WAS A CONSTANT,
VICIOUS CYCLE.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.468
IT'S HIM.
HE DID IT.

19:33.510 --> 19:35.831
BUST HIM, SHAWN.
SEE IT, SEE IT.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.869
SEE IT.
STOP IT.

19:39.850 --> 19:42.557
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANTED HIM
OUT OF THE WAY.

19:42.590 --> 19:43.852
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.892
HE WAS A PAIN, BUT HE WAS
OUR BEST SUPPORTER.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.090
OUR?

19:47.130 --> 19:48.062
THE MITCHELL FAMILY.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.672
WE FOUNDED THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
100 YEARS AGO.

19:51.710 --> 19:53.507
NOW WE'RE LOBBYING THE CITY

19:53.550 --> 19:56.781
TO HAVE THEM DECLARE IT
A HISTORICAL DISTRICT.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.529
FULLER REFUSED TO SELL HIS
HOUSE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.822
WE WERE
THE ONLY FRIENDS HE HAD.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.691
HELLO.

20:03.730 --> 20:04.628
OH, HI, HONEY.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.161
THIS IS SHAWN SPENCER
AND BURTON GUSTER.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.576
I REMEMBER THE TWO OF YOU

20:09.610 --> 20:11.544
FROM WHEN YOU WERE NO MORE

20:11.580 --> 20:13.810
THAN YEA HIGH.

20:13.850 --> 20:17.581
YOU HAD THE CUTEST
LITTLE LAWN-MOWING BUSINESS.

20:17.630 --> 20:20.861
OH, WOW, THAT'S RIGHT.
WE DID.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.130
IN FACT I THINK
WE PAID YOU $5.00

20:23.170 --> 20:25.570
FOR A JOB
THAT NEVER GOT DONE.

20:25.610 --> 20:27.146
[laughter]

20:27.180 --> 20:28.909
OH! THIS GUY.

20:28.950 --> 20:29.917
YOU KNOW, THE YARD TOOLS
ARE OUT BACK.

20:29.950 --> 20:34.057
I'LL GO GET THEM.

20:34.090 --> 20:36.149
SHE'S, UH--
SHE'S NOT SERIOUS, IS SHE?

20:36.200 --> 20:37.667
SHE IS.

20:42.110 --> 20:45.648
OH, AND MAKE SURE
TO WATER THE GARDENIAS.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.989
I'VE HAD THEM LONGER
THAN YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.783
[laughs]

20:56.670 --> 20:59.104
GOD!
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

20:59.140 --> 21:01.677
SHE SHOULD'VE JUST ACCEPTED
THE $5.00 REFUND OFFER.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.156
WE NEED TO BE SOLVING
MY DAD'S CASE.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.692
DUDE.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.336
THERE'S SOMEBODY

21:13.370 --> 21:15.201
IN OLD MAN FULLER'S HOUSE.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.176
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BAIL
ON THE MITCHELLS' YARD AGAIN.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.983
COME ON!

21:28.940 --> 21:31.101
WHO ARE YOU,
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:31.140 --> 21:32.744
I SHOULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.709
MY NAME'S SHAWN.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.648
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
SKOONEY "U-TURN" SINGLETON.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.227
WE'RE FROM DIRTY BOY
LANDSCAPING.

21:43.270 --> 21:44.760
I GOT A CALL FROM YOUR OFFICE,

21:44.800 --> 21:47.109
SAID YOU NEEDED SOME ESTIMATES
ON SOME RENOVATIONS.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.643
WOW.
YOU GUYS ARE FAST.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.544
I JUST LEFT WORD
AT THE OFFICE

21:50.580 --> 21:52.309
SAYING I NEEDED
A LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT.

21:52.350 --> 21:55.046
YOU KNOW, I COLD-CALLED
THIS GEEZER FOR YEARS

21:55.090 --> 21:58.059
PUSHING HIM TO SELL,
AND HE ALWAYS REFUSED.

21:58.090 --> 21:59.352
FINALLY IT'S AVAILABLE.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.368
REALLY?

22:01.400 --> 22:02.628
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THIS PLACE?

22:02.640 --> 22:04.699
IT'S THE ONLY LOT
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

22:04.740 --> 22:07.709
WITH 360-DEGREE
UNOBSTRUCTED VIEWS.

22:07.750 --> 22:11.914
IT'LL SELL FOR A FORTUNE.

22:11.960 --> 22:15.282
DON'T WORRY, THIS YARD WILL BE
IMMACULATE WHEN WE'RE DONE.

22:15.330 --> 22:16.695
BYE-BYE.
BE IN TOUCH.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.061
YOU HEAR HER, SHAWN?

22:18.100 --> 22:19.465
SHE'S BEEN COLD-CALLING
FOR YEARS.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.331
AND SHE STANDS
TO MAKE A FORTUNE ON THIS PLACE.

22:21.370 --> 22:22.473
THAT'S MOTIVE.
RIGHT?

22:22.510 --> 22:24.375
YEAH, YEAH.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.344
IT'S GOTTA BE HER.
WHAT MORE DO WE NEED?

22:26.380 --> 22:28.086
LET'S GET THE COPS
ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.884
UH, I-I GUESS
IT WOULDN'T, UH, HURT

22:30.930 --> 22:33.364
TO HAVE THEM DO
A CURSORY BACKGROUND CHECK.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.994
MAYBE, UH, MAYBE LOOK--
LOOK AT THE PHONE RECORDS.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.735
RIGHT.
OKAY.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.815
I'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

22:44.860 --> 22:47.749
TO MAKE THIS PROCESS
AS PAINLESS AS POSSIBLE.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.964
[whispering]
JULES. JULES, OVER HERE!

22:52.000 --> 22:54.161
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

22:54.210 --> 22:55.438
DID YOU CHECK THE PHONE RECORDS?

22:55.480 --> 22:56.845
YEP, YOUR TIP PAID OFF.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.848
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
THANK GOODNESS.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.518
THERE WERE ALL THESE VIBES,
BUT I WASN'T SURE.

23:00.550 --> 23:01.778
SO IT WAS ROSA.

23:01.820 --> 23:02.752
WHO?

23:02.760 --> 23:03.852
THE REAL ESTATE AGENT.

23:03.890 --> 23:07.963
NO, NO.
SHE HAS A SOLID ALIBI.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.970
BUT WE DISCOVERED QUITE
A FEW CALLS FROM SOMEONE ELSE,

23:12.010 --> 23:13.443
WHO ALSO MADE
NUMEROUS CASH TRANSFERS

23:13.480 --> 23:14.447
INTO FU LLER'S ACCOUNT.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.846
POSSIBLY PAYING OFF
A BLACKMAIL.

23:16.890 --> 23:18.482
WAIT A SECOND, IF YOU'RE NOT
ABOUT TO ARREST ROSA,

23:18.520 --> 23:19.919
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
STANDING HERE?

23:19.960 --> 23:21.894
DISTRACTING YOU.

23:21.930 --> 23:24.569
DISTRACTING--

23:24.600 --> 23:26.932
SORRY, GUS.

23:26.970 --> 23:30.349
SHAWN!
SHAWN!

23:30.380 --> 23:32.519
NO, NO, NO,
MR. GUSTER!

23:32.550 --> 23:34.211
MR. GUSTER.
BURTON, BURTON, PLEASE.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.911
DON'T MAKE A SCENE, DARLING.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.552
THE NEIGHBORS, NEIGHBORS
ARE WATCHING US.

23:37.590 --> 23:38.955
WHAT IS THIS?

23:39.000 --> 23:43.061
GET IN THE CAR, MA'AM.
PLEASE.

23:43.110 --> 23:44.065
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

23:44.110 --> 23:46.499
DON'T YOU TOUCH MY HAIR!

23:58.070 --> 23:59.037
(Gus)
WE GOT HERE AS FAST AS WE COULD.

23:59.070 --> 24:00.094
THIS IS
OUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

24:00.140 --> 24:04.304
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING
IS CONSPIRING AGAINST US.

24:04.350 --> 24:05.908
SO WE LAWYERED UP.

24:05.950 --> 24:07.588
THAT'S HOW THEY SAY IT
IN THE BUCKET, SON,

24:07.620 --> 24:09.485
WHERE I DID
AN EIGHT-HOUR BID.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.318
I DON'T KNOW THOSE WORDS.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.420
I'M NOT GONNA DO WELL
IN PRISON.

24:15.470 --> 24:20.032
DON'T WORRY, SWEETHEART.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.308
[softly]
SHE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

24:21.350 --> 24:25.150
I TOLD YOU,
NOBODY'S GOING TO PRISON.

24:28.030 --> 24:29.588
THAT OLD MAN FULLER WAS
BLACKMAILING YOU

24:29.630 --> 24:31.188
FOR ALL THESE YEARS?

24:31.230 --> 24:33.630
OH, I WANTED TO, BELIEVE ME,
I DID, BUT I COULDN'T.

24:33.670 --> 24:36.036
YOU SEE, THIS ALL STARTED

24:36.080 --> 24:37.604
WHEN BILL'S SAILBOAT
CAUGHT FIRE.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.117
I TRIED TO MUSTER UP THE COURAGE

24:39.150 --> 24:41.084
TO TELL EVERYBODY
THAT IT WAS MY FAULT.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.678
BUT BEFORE I COULD,
THE INSURANCE COMPANY

24:42.720 --> 24:45.154
HAD PAID EVERYTHING OFF ALREADY.

24:45.190 --> 24:47.624
WELL, SOMEHOW, FULLER KNEW
THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

24:47.670 --> 24:49.433
HE THREATENED TO TURN ME IN

24:49.470 --> 24:51.734
FOR INSURANCE FRAUD
IF I DIDN'T PAY HIM EVERY MONTH.

24:51.770 --> 24:54.102
WELL, HE WAS SO OLD,
I FIGURED PAYING HIM OFF

24:54.150 --> 24:55.117
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

24:55.150 --> 24:57.380
WAS THE CHEAPEST ROUTE.

24:57.420 --> 24:58.614
TO THE POLICE
IT LOOKS LIKE MOTIVE.

24:58.660 --> 25:02.528
I KNOW.
BUT DON'T WORRY, SON.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.061
WE HAVE CALLED NANA.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.658
SHE'S TO LOOK AFTER YOU

25:05.700 --> 25:07.702
IN CASE ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN
TO THE TWO OF US.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.607
MOM, I DON'T NEED
MY GRANDMOTHER,

25:10.650 --> 25:12.447
WHO LIVES IN A NURSING HOME
TO LOOK AFTER ME.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.482
WE HEAR YOU, SON.
WE HEAR YOU.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.681
ANYWAY, IT'S JUST
UNTIL WE CAN RAISE THE MONEY

25:16.720 --> 25:19.518
TO POST YOUR MOTHER'S BAIL
AND PAY OUR LEGAL BILLS.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.822
WHATEVER THE COST IS,
I'LL COVER IT.

25:20.870 --> 25:22.098
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

25:22.140 --> 25:24.267
WE APPRECIATE
THE GESTURE, BURTON.

25:24.310 --> 25:26.540
BUT, SON,
WE'RE TALKING REAL MONEY.

25:26.580 --> 25:29.549
YOU HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT
IN A PENNY JAR.

25:29.580 --> 25:30.740
I HAVE A 401(K),

25:30.790 --> 25:34.453
A DIVERSIFIED ASSET-ALLOCATED
PORTFOLIO FULL

25:34.490 --> 25:37.459
OF SECURITIES AND EQUITY
TO TAP INTO.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.569
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD
WITH THE BIG WORDS.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.567
MM-HMM.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.602
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET
FOR THE CUTLASS?

25:41.640 --> 25:42.834
STOP IT!

25:42.880 --> 25:44.609
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE!

25:44.650 --> 25:46.174
ALL OF MY LIFE IT'S BEEN

25:46.220 --> 25:47.380
GUS CAN'T HANDLE THIS!

25:47.420 --> 25:48.819
PROTECT GUS FROM THAT!

25:48.860 --> 25:50.487
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

25:50.520 --> 25:52.522
I'M THE MOST RESPONSIBLE,
WELL-PREPARED,

25:52.560 --> 25:55.324
NON-CRIMINAL-RECORD-HAVING ADULT
IN THIS ROOM.

25:55.370 --> 25:57.702
AND IT'S HIGH TIME YOU TWO
STOPPED BABYING ME.

25:57.740 --> 25:59.537
I'M 29-YEARS-OLD.

25:59.580 --> 26:02.708
AND BY THE WAY, I KNOW YOU'VE
ONLY BEEN MARRIED FOR 28 YEARS.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.889
I DID THE MATH
A LONG TIME AGO.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.751
SO STOP PROTECTING ME
FROM THAT.

26:06.790 --> 26:09.793
STARTING NOW,
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.889
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MONEY.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.760
AND WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS CASE.

26:13.810 --> 26:16.870
SHAWN MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
THE BEST INFLUENCE ON ME,

26:16.910 --> 26:18.400
BUT HE'S ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN ME,

26:18.450 --> 26:19.747
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN MYSELF.

26:19.780 --> 26:24.922
AND RIGHT NOW,
I BELIEVE IN HIM.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.794
WE HEAR YA, SON.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.277
ALL RIGHT, DUDE.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.312
YOU HAD YOUR MOMENT, MAN.
YOU NAILED IT.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.349
NOW GO AHEAD AND MAKE
A TIMELY EXIT.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.654
COME ON, MAN.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.498
BEFORE YOU GOTTA MAKE
ANOTHER SPEECH.

26:45.530 --> 26:47.930
YOUR MOM BEING ARRESTED
MIGHT BE

26:47.970 --> 26:49.369
THE CHRISTMAS MIRACLE WE NEED
FOR THIS THE CASE.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.446
HOW SO?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.789
I SUSPECT SHE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE

26:53.820 --> 26:55.811
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT OLD MAN
FULLER WAS BLACKMAILING.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.851
WE GOTTA GET BACK
IN HIS HOUSE.

27:23.780 --> 27:25.042
(Gus)
LET'S HURRY UP.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.741
THIS PLACE GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

27:41.380 --> 27:42.711
BINGO!

27:42.750 --> 27:44.638
THIS MUST BE HOW OLD MAN FULLER
SAW YOUR MOM

27:44.690 --> 27:45.816
BURN YOUR DAD'S BOAT.

27:45.860 --> 27:48.852
[floorboard creaks loudly]

27:52.170 --> 27:54.001
DUDE, THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THERE.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.007
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

27:55.040 --> 27:58.373
[floor creaks again]

27:58.420 --> 28:01.548
[Shawn makes
a heartbeat sound]

28:01.590 --> 28:05.720
[Shawn continues
making the sound]

28:05.760 --> 28:06.920
WILL YOU STOP IT, SHAWN?

28:06.970 --> 28:08.699
YOU KNOW HOW THAT STORY GIVES ME
THE CREEPS.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.139
[Shawn continues]

28:10.170 --> 28:12.673
[rocking chair creaks]

28:12.710 --> 28:13.745
[as Norma Bates]
NORMAN! NORMAN!

28:13.780 --> 28:14.747
WHOA, WHOA--STOP.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.179
NORMAN!

28:16.220 --> 28:17.983
OKAY, STOP IT, THAT'S ENOUGH!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

28:18.020 --> 28:19.112
GAME OVER.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.151
FINE.

28:24.730 --> 28:26.869
DON'T PLAY, SHAWN.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.539
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

28:51.590 --> 28:53.626
HE WAS SNOOPING ON THE ENTIRE
NEIGHBORHOOD FROM UP HERE.

28:53.660 --> 29:00.600
TH ESE ARE
HIS BLACKMAIL PICTURES.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.005
SUBURBAN POT FARM.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.473
HMM.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.268
BOOTLEG DVD RING.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.550
NONE OF THESE ARE REALLY
CAUSE FOR MURDER.

29:13.900 --> 29:19.133
COVERING AN ILLICIT AFFAIR.

29:19.180 --> 29:20.807
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MOTIVE.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.150
WHAT?

29:39.720 --> 29:41.540
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

29:46.900 --> 29:48.629
HURRY UP.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.912
* I KNOW WHERE
OUR CULPRIT LIVES *

30:07.810 --> 30:08.936
HEY.

30:08.980 --> 30:11.346
GOT SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU
ABOUT SOME ILLICIT PICTURES.

30:12.420 --> 30:14.240
MAN!

30:14.290 --> 30:17.259
[holiday rock music]

30:17.290 --> 30:20.748
*

30:20.800 --> 30:21.789
BUT WE ALREADY KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE!

30:53.230 --> 30:57.200
WE CALL THAT A "SAMMY-FLOYD'S-
TREEHOUSE-SHORTCUT-AMBUSH."

30:57.240 --> 30:58.935
[panting breathlessly]

30:58.980 --> 31:00.174
OKAY, OKAY.

31:00.210 --> 31:02.212
OKAY.
YOU GOT ME.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.717
I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR PICTURES BACK.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.178
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WE HAVE PICTURES OF YOU, DUDE.

31:07.230 --> 31:09.255
THE ONES OLD MAN FULLER
WAS BLACKMAILING YOU FOR.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.324
WHAT PICTURES
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:12.500 --> 31:13.899
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASKING
ABOUT THE PICTURES

31:13.940 --> 31:15.168
OF HOT, NAKED CHICKS
I SOMETIMES KEEP.

31:15.210 --> 31:17.872
(Gus)
WAIT A MINUTE.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.344
THIS ISN'T YOU?

31:20.380 --> 31:22.086
NO.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.122
BUT IT KINDA LOOKS
LIKE MY DAD.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.492
FROM ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE.

31:26.530 --> 31:27.497
MAN, IT WAS AN OLD PICTURE

31:27.530 --> 31:28.565
MIXED IN WITH THE NEW ONES.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.931
WE COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL

31:29.970 --> 31:30.959
BLACK AND WHITE.

31:31.010 --> 31:33.376
SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR HIS DAD?
YES.

31:33.410 --> 31:34.377
HE PASSED AWAY
A FEW YEARS AGO.

31:34.410 --> 31:37.482
NO.
WHO'S THIS WOMAN IN THE PHOTO?

31:37.520 --> 31:38.919
WELL, IT'S NOT MY MOM.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.109
SHE DIED
BEFORE WE MOVED HERE.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.525
WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

31:41.560 --> 31:42.549
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY FEEL
COMFORTABLE TALKING

31:42.590 --> 31:43.921
ABOUT MY FAMILY SECRETS,
ALL RIGHT?

31:43.970 --> 31:44.789
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THAT ONE-HOUR PHOTO

31:44.830 --> 31:46.434
WHERE YOU HIDE
YOUR FILTHY DEBAUCHERY?

31:46.470 --> 31:48.028
I REMEMBER MY DAD
HAD A FEMALE FRIEND

31:48.070 --> 31:49.503
WHO WOULD VISIT
ONLY AT NIGHT.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.507
UH-HUH.
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

31:50.540 --> 31:51.507
I DON'T REMEMBER.

31:51.550 --> 31:52.517
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES?

31:52.550 --> 31:53.574
NO.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.453
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING?
I JUST SWUNG FROM A TREE.

31:56.490 --> 31:58.128
WHEN SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
WOULD SMELL LIKE, UH,

31:58.160 --> 31:59.127
WHITE LINEN PERFUME.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.627
I REMEMBER IT
BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME PERFUME

32:00.660 --> 32:03.436
MY MOM USED TO WEAR
WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE.

32:03.470 --> 32:05.199
SO OUR CULPRIT IS A WOMAN?
APPARENTLY.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.049
WHO LOOKED LIKE THAT
30 YEARS AGO.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.945
SHE'S HOT.

32:08.980 --> 32:09.947
WHAT?

32:09.980 --> 32:11.880
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.107
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.904
IF, UM, YOU GUYS HAVE
AN EXTRA SEAT AT THAT TABLE

32:23.950 --> 32:27.545
FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER,
I MIGHT BE AVAILABLE.

32:27.580 --> 32:30.356
CARLTON, I HAVEN'T BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

32:30.390 --> 32:31.618
YOU SEE, FAMILY--

32:31.660 --> 32:34.163
SAY NO MORE.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.031
DON'T WORRY.

32:36.070 --> 32:37.469
I WON'T COME AROUND ANYMORE.

32:37.510 --> 32:39.330
I AM SO SORRY, CARLTON.

32:39.380 --> 32:40.506
DON'T BE.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.110
I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S TOTALLY NATURAL FOR YOU

32:42.150 --> 32:44.084
TO BE JEALOUS IF YOUR NEPHEWS
LIKE ME MORE THAN YOU.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.542
COME AGAIN?

32:45.590 --> 32:46.989
I GET IT.

32:47.030 --> 32:48.156
YOU'RE USED TO BEING
THE COOL AUNT

32:48.190 --> 32:49.726
THAT EVERYONE WANTS
TO HANG OUT WITH.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.660
BUT WHEN I'M AROUND, YOU
JUST CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.167
SOMETIMES I JUST--

32:53.200 --> 32:55.509
I FORGET TO DIAL DOWN
MY COOLN ESS

32:55.540 --> 32:56.575
WHEN I'M AROUND KIDS.

32:56.610 --> 33:00.046
THEY'RE JUST
SO IMPRESSIONABLE.

33:00.080 --> 33:05.552
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

33:05.590 --> 33:07.490
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

33:07.530 --> 33:10.397
HEY, DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

33:10.440 --> 33:16.310
ALL RIGHT, I'M SURE YOUR NEPHEWS
STILL THINK YOU'RE REALLY FLY.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.341
MERRY CHRISTMAS, CARLTON.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.722
GREAT NEWS.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.590
WE'RE FOLLOWING A NEW LEAD
ON THE CASE.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.062
OH, THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I JUST
GOT MY NOTICE

33:28.110 --> 33:30.738

WELL, THE OLFACTORY

34:25.890 --> 34:28.450

37:03.870 --> 37:05.508
THE COPS HAVE
THE WRONG SUSPECT S.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.043
WELL, THEN WHO'S THE KILLER?

37:08.080 --> 37:12.642
GLADYS MITCHELL?

37:12.690 --> 37:17.093
30 YEARS AGO YOU--

37:17.130 --> 37:18.358
YOU USED TO DELIVER FLOWERS

37:18.400 --> 37:21.130
TO THE NICE LITTLE WIDOWER
WHO MOVED IN DOWN THE STREET.

37:21.170 --> 37:22.239
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER.

37:22.270 --> 37:23.771
THE NEXT THING YOU KNEW,

37:23.810 --> 37:27.246
YOU WERE LOCKED
IN A TORRID, ILLICIT AFFAIR.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.215
DIRTY, SWEATY,
AN AFFAIR THAT IF IT GOT

37:30.260 --> 37:31.488
TO THE PUBLIC WOULD
NOT ONLY RUIN YOUR MARRIAGE,

37:31.530 --> 37:35.022
BUT SOIL THE GOOD NAME OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD'S FOUNDING FAMILY.

37:35.070 --> 37:37.231
OLD MAN FULLER
KNEW YOUR SECRET!

37:37.270 --> 37:42.242
HE COULD SEE EVERYTHING
FROM HIS SNOOPING PERCH.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.168
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SILENCE,
YOU HAD TO CATER

37:44.220 --> 37:47.053
TO ALL OF HIS NEEDS
FOR THE BETTER PART OF 30 YEARS.

37:47.090 --> 37:50.059
BUT OH, THAT BASTARD
JUST WOULDN'T DIE, WOULD HE?

37:50.100 --> 37:53.228
NO, IT WAS AS IF HIS MEANNESS
WAS KEEPING HIM ALIVE.

37:53.270 --> 37:55.738
AND THEN YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
BECAME A REALITY.

37:55.770 --> 37:59.206
HE STARTED GOING SENILE.

37:59.250 --> 38:02.117
YOU COULDN'T RISK HIM TELLING
SOMEBODY ABOUT THE AFFAIR,

38:02.150 --> 38:04.209
SO YOU TOOK MATTERS
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS,

38:04.260 --> 38:06.182
AND YOU KILLED
THE SON OF A BITCH!

38:06.230 --> 38:08.369
THAT'S ABSURD.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.200
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANG
A GROWN MAN FROM UP THERE.

38:12.240 --> 38:16.916
OH, I CAN SEE IT.

38:16.950 --> 38:20.078
YOU TRIED TO POISON HIM!

38:20.120 --> 38:23.226
BUT HE SPIT IT OUT.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.967
THEN YOU PANICKED.
YOU GRABBED A HAMMER.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.366
YOU TRIED
TO BASH IN HIS SKULL!

38:28.410 --> 38:30.378
BUT NO, HE JUST WOULDN'T DIE!

38:30.410 --> 38:32.275
HIS LITTLE FEET TWITCHING
THIS WAY AND THAT!

38:32.310 --> 38:34.210
AND THEN
A REALLY DESPERATE MOVE.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.184
YOU GRABBED
THE DISORIENTED FULLER!

38:36.220 --> 38:38.222
YOU PUSHED HIM OVER TO THE BASE
OF THE STAIRS.

38:38.260 --> 38:40.399
YOU FOUND YOURSELF
A NICE PIECE OF ROPE.

38:42.370 --> 38:43.894
YOU DRAPED THE OTHER END
OVER THE BANNISTER!

38:43.940 --> 38:47.273
AND YOU TIED IT
TO THE CHAIR LIFT.

38:47.310 --> 38:51.417
AND THEN YOU USED
THAT CHAIR LIFT

38:51.450 --> 38:55.784
TO PULL OLD MAN FULLER
ALL THE WAY UP

38:55.830 --> 39:00.233
AND OVER THE BANNISTER AT THIS
RIDICULOUS, AGONIZING PACE.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.445
AND THAT IS HOW YOU KILLED

39:04.480 --> 39:08.280
THAT ANCIENT, PRUNEY RELIC.

39:10.420 --> 39:12.320
I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

39:12.360 --> 39:16.228
I JUST COULDN'T LET HIM
RUIN EVERYTHING

39:16.270 --> 39:17.464
THAT WE WORKED
SO HARD TO BUILD.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.138
UH, GUSTER,

39:19.170 --> 39:21.070
YOU CAN TELL YOUR PARENTS
WE'RE GONNA DROP THE CHARGES.

39:21.110 --> 39:22.441
WHOO!

39:22.480 --> 39:24.812
GOOD WORK, SHAWN.

39:27.260 --> 39:28.852
YOU'VE ALREADY HAD YOUR MOMENT.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.371
ALL RIGHT, LET'S LIGHT
THIS PUPPY UP.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.445
[applause]

39:41.480 --> 39:45.029
WELL, SHAWN, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER DRAW THIS YEAR, HUH?

39:45.060 --> 39:47.824
YES.
IT APPEARS SO.

39:50.540 --> 39:52.838
[Henry laughs]
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.246
LITTLE PSYCH GOLF BALLS.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.441
I ALSO SIGNED YOU UP
FOR LESSONS WITH THE GOLF PRO

39:57.480 --> 39:59.016
DOWN AT THE SANTA BARBARA
MUNICIPAL COURSE.

39:59.050 --> 40:00.813
(Shawn)
THAT'S SWEET, DAD.
THANK YOU.

40:00.860 --> 40:01.884
ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

40:01.930 --> 40:03.295
OH.
ALL RIGHT.

40:03.330 --> 40:08.939
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.574
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

40:10.610 --> 40:13.272
"DEAR DAD, YOU GOT ME

40:13.320 --> 40:15.447
MONOGRAMMED PSYCH GOLF BALLS
AND GOLF LESSONS

40:15.490 --> 40:17.412

AT THE MUNICIPAL COURSE."

40:17.460 --> 40:19.621
TURN IT, TURN IT, TURN IT.

40:19.660 --> 40:21.127
I BELIEVE HIS NAME IS PIERRE.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.127
BOO-YAH !

40:22.170 --> 40:23.398
I GOT YOU, OLD MAN!

40:23.440 --> 40:24.429
[laughs]

40:24.470 --> 40:25.937
THAT'S IT, SHAWN, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE LAST YEAR

40:25.970 --> 40:26.971
WE'RE GONNA PLAY
THIS STUPID LITTLE GAME.

40:27.010 --> 40:28.034
OH, SOMEBODY
DOESN'T LIKE TO LOSE.

40:28.080 --> 40:31.049
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN OLD GRINCH
DURING CHRISTMASTIME.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.651
[laughs]
THE NAME IS EBENEZER GRINCH MAN.

40:33.690 --> 40:34.952
STOP. STOP!

GRINCHIES.

40:34.990 --> 40:36.355

40:36.390 --> 40:38.324
HERE YOU GO.
HERE'S YOUR REAL GIFT.

40:38.370 --> 40:40.065
WHAT?

40:40.100 --> 40:41.260
WAIT, WHAT'S IT GONNA DO?

40:41.300 --> 40:42.506
AH, JUST GIVE HER A RIP.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.178
SO WHAT'S THERE?
WHAT'S--WHAT'S IN THERE?

40:44.210 --> 40:46.940
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
LOOK AT THAT.

40:46.980 --> 40:49.119
THAT'S ME FISHING.

40:49.150 --> 40:50.151
[laughs]

40:50.190 --> 40:51.953

IT'S SNOWING.

40:51.990 --> 40:53.423
THAT'S REALLY NICE, SHAWN.

THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY DINNER.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.602

40:59.640 --> 41:01.278
YES.
THANK YOU.

41:01.310 --> 41:03.175

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.279
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.117
I GOT A PERFECT PLACE
FOR THIS.

41:06.150 --> 41:07.117
YOU ALL SHOULD GET SOME REST.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.218
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

41:08.260 --> 41:11.195
FINALLY THINGS CAN GET BACK
TO THE WAY THEY WERE.

41:11.230 --> 41:12.299
WELL, ALMOST.

41:12.330 --> 41:15.436
I'VE BEEN THINKING,
MAYBE WE COULD USE SOME ADVICE

41:15.470 --> 41:18.109
ABOUT THAT
DIVERSIFICATION STU FF.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.017
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE DOING
PRETTY GOOD FOR YOURSELF.

41:20.050 --> 41:23.759
AND MAKING
SOME GOOD BUSINESS DECISIONS.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.179
OH, SURE!
