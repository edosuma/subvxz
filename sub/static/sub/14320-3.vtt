XAVIER: Who are you?

01:21.416 --> 01:22.875
Where have you come from?

01:31.625 --> 01:34.708
How do I know you?
How do I possibly know you?

01:49.875 --> 01:53.250
By what miracle
do I feel your fear,
your pain?

02:02.416 --> 02:04.583
Who is trying to hurt you?

02:04.583 --> 02:07.333
Why would they?
Why can't you get away?

02:14.708 --> 02:15.750

02:50.583 --> 02:53.708
LILANDRA: Help me,

For the sake of the future,
help me.

XAVIER ON PA:
All X-Men report to
the War Room, immediately.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.708
Repeat,
all X-Men to
the War Room.

WOLVERINE: So what's the
big deal that couldn't
wait till morning?

03:23.625 --> 03:25.625
I...

03:25.625 --> 03:28.333
I'm sorry, Wolverine,
but I wouldn't have
disturbed you

03:28.333 --> 03:30.583
if I didn't feel
it was important.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.208
Oh, no!
I forgot.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.125
XAVIER: Rogue is
still out on
a mission.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.208
Does anyone know
where Gambit is?

03:40.208 --> 03:42.750
Look like I come
home just in time.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.166
Late date, hey, Gumbo?

03:45.166 --> 03:46.375
Not for me.

03:47.958 --> 03:53.208
The space shuttle Starcore is
scheduled for launch tomorrow.

03:53.208 --> 03:56.958
Yes, I just recently
spoke with Dr. Corbeau.

03:56.958 --> 04:00.166
He intends
to study a unique
solar vortex phenomenon.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.750
JUBILEE:
Professor Xavier...

04:01.750 --> 04:03.458
CYCLOPS: Professor...

04:03.458 --> 04:06.458
You must find a way
to get aboard that
shuttle.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.166
And go to the Eagle One
space station.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.833
Or Dr. Corbeau and
his crew are doomed!

04:11.833 --> 04:15.875
Breaking into government
installation's not
usually our style.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.250
What
are we supposed
to do on Eagle One?

04:18.250 --> 04:19.458
I...

04:19.458 --> 04:21.875
I wish I could tell you.

04:21.875 --> 04:26.083
I don't much like getting
blown off the planet
without knowing why.

04:26.083 --> 04:30.708
All I can tell you is that
an event of immense
importance

04:30.708 --> 04:34.708
is about to occur in space.
You must be ready.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.291
You heard the Professor.
We've got a shuttle to catch.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.000
Oh, well.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.625
Makes about as much sense
as some of the stuff we do.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.291
XAVIER:
Storm, you'll help the
others board the shuttle,

04:44.291 --> 04:46.958
but I want you
to remain on
Earth.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.500
I thought
you might come.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.083
Sorry to bother you,
Professor,

04:59.083 --> 05:01.125
but I wanted to
talk to you in
private.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.000
Why can't you tell us
what this mission is
really about?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.875
Don't you trust us?
Don't you trust me
to lead the team?

05:06.875 --> 05:09.500
Of course I trust you,
Scott.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.583
I wish I could tell you more,

05:11.583 --> 05:14.958
but the visions I have
seen these past days

05:14.958 --> 05:18.416
make me feel as if
I'm losing control.

05:18.416 --> 05:22.000
Even I don't know
what they mean.

We'll need some kind of cover
if we're going to get to
those buildings

06:08.250 --> 06:09.875
without anyone seeing us.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.250
Storm.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.166
Fog,

06:13.166 --> 06:17.291
rise and enshroud us in
the cloak of your gray mists!

06:21.000 --> 06:22.250
(RUMBLING)

06:28.708 --> 06:31.375
All right, Beast,
get us over that

on the job, huh?

(CHUCKLES)
Any landing you can
walk away from, old boy.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.958
Do that again
and we'll see
where you land!

06:50.958 --> 06:52.583
Come on,
quit fooling around.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.958
Sorry, Dad.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.375

to get yourself
caught.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.125
I know.

07:30.125 --> 07:33.250
Look, you know they
have to catch somebody,
or they'll scrub the launch.

07:33.250 --> 07:37.208
It's just not fair.
I always wanted to
be an astronaut!

07:37.208 --> 07:40.875
Storm and the Professor
will get you out as soon
as the shuttle's launched.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.166
Good luck!

07:44.125 --> 07:46.875
I never get

07:46.875 --> 07:48.208
SECURITY GUARD: Hey! Kid!

07:48.208 --> 07:49.958
What do you think
you're doing here?

07:49.958 --> 07:52.208
Wow, is this like
totally embarrassing?

07:52.208 --> 07:54.708
I mean,
I just thought
I'd have a look.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.875
I didn't think
it was any big deal.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.708
You're coming with us.
Now!

07:58.708 --> 08:01.958
Sure. Whatever
you say, Officer.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.375
Hey, what...

08:17.583 --> 08:20.583
Sorry, gentlemen, but
if the Professor's right,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.333
I may have just
saved your lives.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.291
WOLVERINE: Plenty
of food and water.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.250
With any luck,
nobody will find them

08:27.250 --> 08:31.708

from the mission,
whatever it is.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.875
What?

08:44.875 --> 08:46.708
What is it,
Dr. Corbeau?

08:46.708 --> 08:48.625
Is something wrong?

08:48.625 --> 08:51.000
For a moment,
I thought you were...

08:52.083 --> 08:53.416
Never mind.

08:53.416 --> 08:54.833
It's time to
board the shuttle.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.708
We're ready, Doctor.

09:18.291 --> 09:22.500
I just wish I knew
what they were facing.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.708
Trust them, Professor,
as they have trusted you.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.500
They have Jubilee.

The shuttle crew has been

They must know of my

How could they?

Lilandra!

Why did you
not prevent this?

I shall!

You will not
fail me again.

ERIC THE RED: The vortex
you've come to study is
what your primitive science

15:18.500 --> 15:23.416
would designate
as a wormhole, a tear
in the fabric of space.

15:23.416 --> 15:27.500
We Shi'ar
are capable of opening
such galactic passageways

15:27.500 --> 15:29.708
when circumstances require it.

15:29.708 --> 15:33.583
My purpose
here is to intercept
an enemy of my emperor,

15:33.583 --> 15:38.125
the rebel Lilandra,
who will soon travel
through the wormhole.

15:38.125 --> 15:41.625
I have mounted
an energy weapon
capable of disabling

15:41.625 --> 15:43.625
her rebel star cruiser,

15:43.625 --> 15:48.291
especially when
fired from an unassuming
primitive space station.

15:48.291 --> 15:50.208
But who are you?

15:50.208 --> 15:53.875
I am an agent of the
Shi'ar emperor for
this sector.

15:53.875 --> 15:57.458

I have waited for
my emperor to need me!

I can be assigned to
a more important planet.

been space debris!

Not as yet, Excellency.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.875
But her agents
will soon be
destroyed.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.125
Can this thing still fly?

18:01.125 --> 18:02.416
We're about to find out.

18:06.958 --> 18:10.083
COMPUTER: Warning.
Reactor overload
imminent.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.000
Warning. Reactor
overload imminent.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.375
We made it, Doctor!

18:34.000 --> 18:36.833
COMPUTER: Target locked
on Shi'ar cruiser.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.458
The Shi'ar star cruiser!

18:46.458 --> 18:48.708
We're going to
fly right through
the energy contrail!

18:48.708 --> 18:50.458
Controls have been damaged.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.166
Fuel is low and leaking.
We can't change course!

18:53.166 --> 18:54.458
Can the ship take it?

18:54.458 --> 18:56.125
I don't know.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.000
I'm getting powerful,
unknown readings,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.458
so intense
they're completely
off the scale!

19:00.458 --> 19:04.875
Look like there gonna be
a barbecue and we gonna
be the main course.

19:04.875 --> 19:09.291
Doctor, the solar probe!
Its shielding should be
able to protect us.

19:09.291 --> 19:12.333
Yes, of course.
But the autopilot is shot.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.125
I'll have to
stay behind and pilot
the shuttle for re-entry.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.125
If the
radiation level is
as high as you say,

19:18.125 --> 19:20.875
you would
never survive long
enough to land us.

19:20.875 --> 19:25.458
I can fly it. I can
telepathically absorb
Dr. Corbeau's flight training

19:25.458 --> 19:30.083
and generate a psychokinetic
shield to protect myself
from the radiation.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.250
I won't allow it!
It's too dangerous!

19:32.250 --> 19:35.208
You said it yourself,
the team's mission
comes first.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.125
There's no other way.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.625
If I can fly the Blackbird,
I can fly the space shuttle!

19:39.625 --> 19:42.875
Your chances of survival
are too small to compute.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.458
I lead the team.
This is my job.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.958
I'm sorry, Scott.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.875
(CYCLOPS GROANS)

19:48.875 --> 19:50.458
There's no other way.

WOLVERINE: Jean, I...

20:01.291 --> 20:03.125
Don't try to stop me, Logan.

20:03.125 --> 20:06.166
I wouldn't.
I just wanted
to say good luck.
