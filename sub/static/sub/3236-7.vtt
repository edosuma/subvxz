00:00.059 --> 00:03.083
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

00:03.158 --> 00:04.791
The methylamine...
Jesse and I will be

00:04.899 --> 00:06.731
taking our two thirds
and we're selling it.

00:06.892 --> 00:09.449
Full thousand gallons,
not a drop less.

00:09.591 --> 00:12.350
Mike's connection won't buy
unless he gets your share too.

00:12.469 --> 00:13.631
Absolutely not.

00:14.676 --> 00:16.817
This deal's going down,
but for some reason,

00:16.940 --> 00:19.442
I don't trust you alone
with the methylamine.

00:19.559 --> 00:21.194
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

00:23.738 --> 00:27.162
You get your five millions, we
both do, and he gets his methylamine!

00:27.276 --> 00:28.468
Is that true, Walter?

00:28.574 --> 00:29.925
Everybody wins.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.923 --> 00:54.841
There.

00:56.010 --> 00:58.011
That's them.

01:09.406 --> 01:12.108
Your play, Walter.

01:12.142 --> 01:14.143
You're on your own.

01:28.292 --> 01:31.394
Looks like you're about 1,000
gallons light here, Mike.

01:31.428 --> 01:33.396
Where's the juice?

01:33.430 --> 01:35.732
The methylamine isn't coming.

01:38.035 --> 01:40.203
Why is that?

01:40.237 --> 01:42.171
And who the hell are you?

01:42.206 --> 01:43.673
I'm the man who's keeping it.

01:43.707 --> 01:46.509
What the hell's this?

01:46.527 --> 01:49.195
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

01:49.229 --> 01:52.181
So where's the tank, Mike?
Mike doesn't know where it is.

01:52.199 --> 01:55.652
Only I do. And you're dealing
with me now, not him.

01:55.686 --> 01:57.853
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

01:57.871 --> 02:00.022
or what you think is gonna
happen here, all right?

02:00.040 --> 02:02.825
'Cause we're gonna get
what we came for.

02:02.859 --> 02:06.195
That 1,000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

02:06.213 --> 02:08.881
than it is in yours or anyone
else's, for that matter.

02:08.916 --> 02:11.884
But I need distribution.

02:11.919 --> 02:14.387
Distribution.

02:14.421 --> 02:16.372
That's right.

02:16.390 --> 02:19.875
So if you agree
to give up your cook

02:19.893 --> 02:22.729
and sell my product instead,

02:22.763 --> 02:25.214
I'll give you 35 percent
of the take.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.884
35 percent?
Wow. Are you kidding me?

02:28.902 --> 02:32.221
35-- Mike, please tell
me this is a joke.

02:32.239 --> 02:35.608
You know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

02:35.659 --> 02:37.393
And why the hell
would we want you?

02:37.411 --> 02:39.412
You realize we have
our own operation, right?

02:39.446 --> 02:42.081
I know all about
your operation.

02:42.116 --> 02:45.501
My partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

02:45.536 --> 02:48.955
that's 70% pure,
if you're lucky.

02:49.006 --> 02:53.209
What I produce
is 99.1% pure.

02:53.243 --> 02:54.744
So?

02:57.715 --> 03:01.934
So... it's grade school T-Ball

03:01.969 --> 03:04.604
versus the New York Yankees.

03:04.638 --> 03:08.307
Yours is, uh, just some tepid,

03:08.358 --> 03:11.594
off-brand,
generic cola.

03:11.612 --> 03:15.598
What I'm making
is classic Coke.

03:15.616 --> 03:18.367
All right. Okay.

03:18.402 --> 03:20.319
So, um,

03:20.370 --> 03:22.622
if we just waste you
right here,

03:22.656 --> 03:24.791
right now,
and leave you in the desert,

03:24.825 --> 03:27.376
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

03:27.411 --> 03:30.129
See how that works?
There's only us.

03:31.498 --> 03:34.116
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca Cola?

03:44.595 --> 03:47.730
My partner tells me
that your crew

03:47.765 --> 03:50.650
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

03:50.684 --> 03:53.019
You dye your meth
with food coloring

03:53.070 --> 03:54.687
to make it look like mine.

03:54.738 --> 03:59.158
You already ape my product
at every turn.

03:59.193 --> 04:00.943
But now...

04:00.977 --> 04:03.362
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

04:03.413 --> 04:05.414
I need you to listen to me.

04:05.449 --> 04:07.416
We're not gonna
give up this deal

04:07.451 --> 04:10.536
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

04:10.587 --> 04:12.538
For what?

04:12.589 --> 04:14.874
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

04:14.925 --> 04:18.594
A better high
means customers pay more.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.016
A higher purity
means a greater yield.

04:24.051 --> 04:27.336
That's 130 million dollars
a profit

04:27.354 --> 04:31.357
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

04:31.391 --> 04:34.227
Now you listen to me.

04:34.278 --> 04:36.512
You've got the greatest
meth cook in a--

04:36.530 --> 04:38.564
No, the two

04:38.615 --> 04:41.150
greatest meth cooks
in America right here,

04:41.184 --> 04:43.736
and with our skills,

04:43.787 --> 04:46.289
you'll earn more from that 35%

04:46.323 --> 04:48.357
than you ever would
on your own.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.526
Yeah. So you say.

04:50.544 --> 04:52.695
Just wondering why
we're so lucky.

04:52.713 --> 04:54.630
Why cut us in?

04:54.665 --> 04:57.583
Mike is retiring from our crew,

04:57.634 --> 05:00.303
so his share of the partnership
is available,

05:00.337 --> 05:03.472
if you can handle his end--

05:03.507 --> 05:05.675
distribution.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.894
And if you give him
five million dollars

05:07.928 --> 05:09.896
of the 15 million
that you brought today.

05:09.930 --> 05:12.081
Just think of it
as a finder's fee

05:12.115 --> 05:14.317
for bringing us together.

05:14.351 --> 05:17.954
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship,

05:17.988 --> 05:19.689
ready to go.

05:19.723 --> 05:22.992
Are you ready?

05:42.429 --> 05:44.430
Who the hell are ya?

05:44.464 --> 05:46.382
You know.

05:46.416 --> 05:50.386
You all know exactly who I am.

05:52.255 --> 05:54.256
Say my name.

05:55.275 --> 05:56.926
Do what? I don't--

05:56.944 --> 05:59.145
I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

05:59.196 --> 06:01.931
Yeah, you do.
I'm the cook.

06:03.984 --> 06:06.602
I'm the man
who killed Gus Fring.

06:06.620 --> 06:10.072
Bullshit.
Cartel got Fring.

06:10.106 --> 06:11.607
Are you sure?

06:21.501 --> 06:23.135
That's right.

06:23.170 --> 06:27.306
Now... say my name.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.430
Heisenberg.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.601
You're goddamn right.

06:45.201 --> 06:50.668
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

07:11.480 --> 07:14.649
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

07:18.821 --> 07:20.772
Hey.

07:20.823 --> 07:23.191
I appreciate the kind words,

07:23.225 --> 07:25.193
but I'm out too,

07:25.227 --> 07:27.195
remember?

07:27.229 --> 07:29.563
I know.
We'll talk.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.619
Maybe we should talk
about how and when

07:34.670 --> 07:36.904
I'm gonna get
my five million dollars.

07:36.922 --> 07:39.040
And we will do that.

07:39.074 --> 07:41.376
Absolutely.

07:41.410 --> 07:43.428
It's just, you know--

07:43.462 --> 07:46.014
Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

07:46.048 --> 07:48.749
I'll need a little help getting things
up and running during this transition.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.584
You can at least
do that for me, right?

07:52.554 --> 07:55.273
Huh? Come on.
Don't worry.

07:55.307 --> 07:57.942
We'll figure it out.

08:28.590 --> 08:32.092
Well, I guess that's it.

08:32.126 --> 08:34.395
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two...

08:34.429 --> 08:36.347
First, as I said,

08:36.398 --> 08:38.399
I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end

08:38.433 --> 08:40.818
so you won't have to worry
about my guys anymore.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.854
Second, the bug.

08:42.905 --> 08:45.990
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when. Could be anytime.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.192
But you need
to get it outta there,

08:48.243 --> 08:50.244
sooner rather than later.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.332
All right.

08:54.366 --> 08:56.317
That's it?

08:56.335 --> 08:59.653
No "thanks for
the five million dollars,"

08:59.671 --> 09:02.840
no "sorry for chaining you
to a radiator"?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.844
Just get the bug, Walter.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.686
So, hey.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.891
I guess, uh--

09:19.942 --> 09:21.976
I guess I'll see you around.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.278
No. Don't think so.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.314
When I'm out, I'm out.

09:27.566 --> 09:30.318
Well, I'm out, too, Mike.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.206
Kid...

09:35.240 --> 09:37.708
just look out for yourself.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.253
Are we good?

10:22.287 --> 10:24.288
You tell me.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.075
Okay, Jesse.
Back it up.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.579
You're good.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.432
Keep it coming.
Straight back.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.434
Slow it down.

10:36.468 --> 10:38.469
All right.
That's good.

10:44.726 --> 10:46.644
Hey, Mrs. White.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.826
<i>Vamonos.</i>

11:01.877 --> 11:03.995
I wish.

11:04.046 --> 11:06.747
All right. Let's get
this thing hooked up.

11:06.781 --> 11:09.250
Walt...

11:14.623 --> 11:16.557
What is this?

11:16.592 --> 11:18.593
Do you really wanna know?

11:19.895 --> 11:21.812
Why are you hiding it here?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.431
Don't worry about it.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.066
Who are you hiding it from?

11:25.100 --> 11:28.102
I said,
"don't worry about it."

11:28.136 --> 11:30.404
From the police?

11:30.439 --> 11:33.241
Or someone else?

11:33.275 --> 11:35.276
Someone who would kill for it?

11:35.310 --> 11:37.612
Why don't you
go back in the office?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.616
Why don't you
go back in the office

11:41.650 --> 11:43.751
and let us do this?

11:43.785 --> 11:46.037
We'll get it out of your hair.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.968
Oh! What'd you
bring me this time?

12:19.003 --> 12:21.171
They're bacon banana cookies.

12:21.222 --> 12:24.457
Is there bacon in these?
Oh, my God!

12:24.475 --> 12:26.459
Just bits.
Just little bits of bacon.

12:26.477 --> 12:28.794
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

12:28.813 --> 12:31.815
Dan, this is too much.

12:31.849 --> 12:33.483
I'm not sharing those.

12:33.517 --> 12:35.401
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

12:35.436 --> 12:37.904
- They're mine. - Well, they're yours
to do with as you please.

12:37.938 --> 12:41.024
Good, 'cause my husband's
not getting any either.

12:41.075 --> 12:43.359
- How is Mickey?
- Don't get me started.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.361
He wants to buy a boat.

12:45.412 --> 12:48.081
I can't even get him
to start the lawnmower,

12:48.115 --> 12:50.783
and he wants to buy a boat.

12:50.817 --> 12:52.418
Oh, I don't know.
A boat might be nice.

12:52.453 --> 12:54.337
A little one, maybe.

12:54.371 --> 12:57.423
Oh, please. Where would
you even take a boat?

12:57.458 --> 12:59.792
All the way down
to Elephant Butte?

12:59.826 --> 13:02.962
Or Caballo.
It's beautiful down there.

13:02.996 --> 13:04.547
You can even leave it
at the lake

13:04.598 --> 13:06.349
if you don't want
to haul it every time.

13:06.383 --> 13:08.134
We are not buying a boat.

13:08.168 --> 13:10.436
I'll tell you that right now.

13:10.471 --> 13:14.557
- And the last one is 545.
- 569.

13:14.608 --> 13:16.226
Aw, dang it.

13:16.277 --> 13:18.344
- I almost got them all at time.
- Very good.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.363
But actually,
I've got an extra one

13:20.397 --> 13:22.532
for you this week--
603.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.817
603. Where is that?

13:24.851 --> 13:26.786
- Right down there.
- Ah.

13:30.324 --> 13:32.992
All right.
I'll let you get to it.

13:33.026 --> 13:34.694
Thanks, Dot.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.751
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box

15:04.785 --> 15:07.003
if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

15:07.054 --> 15:08.287
Mm.

15:09.306 --> 15:11.290
How's the rest of it?

15:11.308 --> 15:13.393
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

15:13.427 --> 15:16.295
The families are pretty
reliable with the pickups.

15:16.313 --> 15:18.798
Nobody complaining about
wanting it all at once?

15:18.816 --> 15:22.151
Nah, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

15:23.904 --> 15:25.855
So I guess this is it
for a while?

15:25.906 --> 15:27.306
Mm.

15:27.324 --> 15:29.809
Don't worry about the families.

15:29.827 --> 15:31.995
They'll keep getting
their deliveries.

15:40.537 --> 15:43.506
<i>I know times
are tight, but it's for the kids,</i>

15:43.540 --> 15:46.709
<i>and your sponsorship</i>
<i>would sure be appreciated.</i>

15:46.760 --> 15:48.678
<i>Yeah. We have</i>
<i>a, um, silver level,</i>

15:48.712 --> 15:50.763
<i>but the gold</i>
<i>and platinum levels</i>

15:50.798 --> 15:52.765
<i>really get your name out there</i>

15:52.800 --> 15:55.802
<i>on the banners</i>
<i>and t-shirts.</i>

15:55.836 --> 15:57.770
<i>Sure. No.</i>
<i>No, that's not a problem.</i>

15:57.805 --> 15:59.772
<i>No, you call me directly</i>
<i>if things change,</i>

15:59.807 --> 16:02.108
<i>you hear?</i>

16:02.142 --> 16:04.944
<i>Gomie, take a brick to my head</i>

16:04.978 --> 16:06.946
<i>if I ever have to make</i>
<i>another fun run call.</i>

16:06.980 --> 16:08.898
<i>I'm done.</i>

16:08.949 --> 16:11.401
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>Why you smiling?</i>

16:11.452 --> 16:13.686
<i>'Cause the Ehrmantraut
warrant just came in.</i>

16:13.704 --> 16:15.187
<i>Oh, baby, now we're talking.</i>

16:15.205 --> 16:16.873
<i>How quick can you get</i>
<i>your group together?</i>

16:16.907 --> 16:18.357
<i>Two, three hours.</i>
<i>Make it two.</i>

16:18.375 --> 16:20.460
<i>We're gonna nail</i>
<i>that son of a bi--</i>

17:50.918 --> 17:53.252
Police!
Search warrant!

17:59.426 --> 18:01.060
Police!
Search warrant!

18:01.094 --> 18:02.562
Coming.

18:02.596 --> 18:04.313
Hold your horses.

18:06.817 --> 18:08.484
Search warrant.

18:08.519 --> 18:10.736
Police!
Search warrant!

18:10.737 --> 18:12.872
Police!
Search warrant!

18:12.873 --> 18:14.304
Police!
Search warrant!

18:14.339 --> 18:16.108
How's that restraining order
working out for you?

18:16.142 --> 18:18.161
Uh, if you want me
to read that,

18:18.195 --> 18:20.145
I'm gonna need my glasses.

18:26.003 --> 18:28.654
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip
out from headquarters, Sergeant.</i>

18:28.672 --> 18:30.456
<i>From out of bed, you mean.</i>

18:30.490 --> 18:32.825
<i>When a cop kills himself,</i>
<i>they want a full report.</i>

18:37.014 --> 18:38.798
<i>A single contact wound.</i>

18:38.832 --> 18:41.050
<i>Powder burn on his temple</i>
<i>and right hand.</i>

18:41.101 --> 18:42.552
<i>Suicide, I think.</i>

18:42.603 --> 18:44.520
<i>Tell the wagon boys they
can have him. Yes.</i>

18:44.555 --> 18:46.522
<i>When I found him,</i>

18:46.557 --> 18:48.641
<i>he-- he was dead.</i>

18:56.349 --> 18:58.651
Hey! Perfect timing.

18:58.685 --> 19:01.020
Just about to get started.

19:02.623 --> 19:04.073
Uh, you know,

19:04.124 --> 19:06.075
if you can get going
on that settling tank,

19:06.126 --> 19:08.461
that would be a huge help.

19:08.495 --> 19:12.031
We left that stuff in there
too long after the last cook.

19:12.049 --> 19:14.366
- Mr. White--
- I mean way too long.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.919
Now we have a tremendous
amount of residue.

19:16.970 --> 19:19.705
You know what we need to
invest in is a power washer.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.341
Mr. White,
can we just take a second

19:22.375 --> 19:24.376
and talk about all this?

19:29.983 --> 19:32.051
Yeah, yeah, sure.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.719
Yeah.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.271
Yeah.

19:38.108 --> 19:40.076
Um-- uh, look, you know what

19:40.110 --> 19:43.112
I think we need to talk about?

19:43.163 --> 19:45.114
Is doubling down.

19:45.165 --> 19:47.617
- Doubling down?
- Mm-hmm.

19:47.668 --> 19:51.003
Cooking 100 pounds a week,
not 50.

19:51.038 --> 19:53.005
As in starting
a new lab--

19:53.040 --> 19:54.924
A lab that you'll run.

19:54.958 --> 19:57.910
A cook all of your own.

19:57.928 --> 20:00.680
Why not?
You deserve it.

20:00.714 --> 20:03.633
You're every bit as good as me.

20:03.684 --> 20:06.585
Well, what do you think?

20:06.603 --> 20:08.587
Mr. White, uh,

20:08.605 --> 20:12.942
I think that nothing
has changed for me.

20:12.976 --> 20:16.896
I just wanna get my money
and-- and get out.

20:18.815 --> 20:21.984
Jesse, this...

20:23.954 --> 20:26.238
What we do...

20:30.110 --> 20:32.912
Being the best at something

20:32.946 --> 20:34.914
is a very rare thing.

20:34.948 --> 20:37.416
You don't just toss
something like that away.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.088
And what, you wanna
squander that potential?

20:42.122 --> 20:44.957
Your potential?
Why?

20:44.975 --> 20:47.093
To do what?

20:47.127 --> 20:49.095
I don't know.

20:49.129 --> 20:50.930
Well, think.

20:50.964 --> 20:53.599
To do what, Jesse?

20:55.819 --> 20:59.155
Well, I'll figure it out,
all right?

20:59.189 --> 21:01.306
Look at you.

21:01.325 --> 21:03.326
What have you got
in your life, huh?

21:03.360 --> 21:05.745
Nothing. Nobody.

21:05.779 --> 21:07.663
Oh, wait. Yes.

21:07.698 --> 21:10.166
- Video games and go-carts.
- Mr. White--

21:10.200 --> 21:13.119
And when you get tired
of that, what then? Huh?

21:13.153 --> 21:16.655
And how soon will you
start using again?

21:19.042 --> 21:21.127
Look...

21:21.161 --> 21:23.662
Look, I know how upset you are

21:23.680 --> 21:26.331
about what happened
to this boy.

21:26.350 --> 21:29.352
I am just as upset as you are.

21:29.386 --> 21:32.722
Are you? Really?

21:34.474 --> 21:37.509
How can you say that
to me? Jesus!

21:37.527 --> 21:40.146
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

21:40.180 --> 21:43.482
What, do I have to curl up in a
ball in tears in front of you?

21:43.516 --> 21:45.517
Do I have to lock myself
away in a room

21:45.535 --> 21:47.519
and get high
to prove it to you?

21:47.537 --> 21:50.072
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy,

21:50.123 --> 21:52.524
and it tears me up inside!

21:52.542 --> 21:54.526
But because it happened, what,

21:54.544 --> 21:56.528
am I supposed to just lie down

21:56.546 --> 21:58.530
and die with him?

21:58.548 --> 22:00.082
It's done!

22:00.133 --> 22:02.084
It makes me sick
that it happened,

22:02.135 --> 22:05.037
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

22:05.055 --> 22:06.972
What Todd did--

22:07.007 --> 22:10.709
You and I have done things
that are just as bad.

22:10.727 --> 22:12.044
Yeah.

22:12.062 --> 22:14.046
All the people
that we've killed--

22:14.064 --> 22:17.266
Gale and the rest...

22:17.317 --> 22:19.268
If you believe
that there's a hell--

22:19.319 --> 22:22.271
I don't know if you're into that.
But we're...

22:22.322 --> 22:24.723
We're already pretty much
going there, right?

22:24.741 --> 22:28.244
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

22:28.278 --> 22:32.748
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

22:32.783 --> 22:35.400
How many more people
are gonna die 'cause of us?

22:35.419 --> 22:37.569
No one. None.

22:37.587 --> 22:40.289
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

22:40.340 --> 22:44.210
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

22:44.244 --> 22:46.712
- No.
- Always! You know what?

22:46.746 --> 22:49.632
I'm done, okay?

22:49.683 --> 22:51.634
You just give me my money,

22:51.685 --> 22:54.136
and you and I--

22:54.187 --> 22:56.439
we're done.

22:58.892 --> 23:02.228
Hmm. Okay.

23:03.230 --> 23:04.730
Why?

23:06.599 --> 23:09.401
Why do you want this money?

23:10.570 --> 23:14.290
Because it's mine.
It's my cut.

23:14.324 --> 23:17.042
But isn't it filthy
blood money?

23:17.077 --> 23:20.496
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

23:20.547 --> 23:23.299
No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.918
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

23:26.953 --> 23:28.587
Come on.

23:28.621 --> 23:30.256
You want it.

23:30.290 --> 23:32.842
You want it just as much
as I want it.

23:32.893 --> 23:35.845
And it's not wrong to want it.

23:35.896 --> 23:37.346
Okay?

23:37.397 --> 23:41.233
So stay and work with me,

23:41.268 --> 23:44.469
and you can make ten ti--
20 times as much.

23:48.975 --> 23:51.744
Whatever, man.

23:51.778 --> 23:55.197
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

23:55.282 --> 23:56.699
Yes, you do.

23:56.750 --> 23:59.251
It's on you, all right?

24:00.287 --> 24:02.204
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

24:02.255 --> 24:04.673
You're not done.
You're not leaving,

24:04.708 --> 24:07.209
because if you leave,
you get nothing!

24:07.260 --> 24:10.796
Do you understand me?
Nothing!

24:10.830 --> 24:13.299
Jesse!

24:18.018 --> 24:20.553
<i>Budget for the current fiscal
year for electronic surveillance</i>

24:20.587 --> 24:21.854
<i>is 1.5 million,</i>

24:21.888 --> 24:24.490
<i>on par with ATF</i>
<i>and the Marshal Service,</i>

24:24.524 --> 24:26.959
<i>but still just a fraction</i>
<i>of FBI totals.</i>

24:26.993 --> 24:30.045
<i>We're lobbying congress</i>
<i>for an additional 1.41,</i>

24:30.096 --> 24:32.181
<i>but we're waiting</i>
<i>on action reports</i>

24:32.215 --> 24:34.800
<i>to demonstrate we're
actually getting worthwhile results.</i>

24:34.834 --> 24:37.002
<i>Our undercover operations</i>

24:37.037 --> 24:39.522
<i>reap the most successful</i>
<i>actionable intelligence,</i>

24:39.556 --> 24:42.224
<i>if you refer to the chart</i>
<i>in appendix four.</i>

24:42.275 --> 24:45.344
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us</i>
<i>about the surveillance man-hours--</i>

24:45.362 --> 24:47.813
<i>Hank?</i>

24:47.847 --> 24:49.565
<i>Hank?</i>

24:49.616 --> 24:51.367
<i>Hank!</i>

24:52.786 --> 24:55.237
<i>I think we're going</i>
<i>to wrap this up.</i>

24:55.288 --> 24:57.239
<i>If ASAC Schrader</i>
<i>can stay behind</i>

24:57.290 --> 24:59.074
<i>while everyone else clears out.</i>

24:59.125 --> 25:01.410
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

25:14.341 --> 25:16.225
<i>You know no one wants</i>

25:16.259 --> 25:18.394
<i>to see you succeed at this</i>
<i>more than me, right?</i>

25:18.428 --> 25:21.096
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I know how good you are.</i>

25:21.147 --> 25:24.233
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

25:24.267 --> 25:26.602
<i>But you're not knocking</i>
<i>down doors anymore, Bubba.</i>

25:26.653 --> 25:28.771
<i>You're in charge</i>
<i>of an entire district office,</i>

25:28.822 --> 25:30.990
<i>and that comes</i>
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

25:31.024 --> 25:33.192
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports</i>

25:33.226 --> 25:35.494
<i>aren't being filed</i>
<i>in a timely manner.</i>

25:35.528 --> 25:37.413
I'll work on it.
It'll get better.

25:37.447 --> 25:39.832
<i>Yeah, it will, because way
too much time and money</i>

25:39.866 --> 25:41.533
<i>is being spent</i>
<i>on the Fring case,</i>

25:41.567 --> 25:43.202
<i>a case which is</i>
<i>essentially over.</i>

25:43.236 --> 25:45.087
<i>All this overtime</i>

25:45.121 --> 25:47.373
<i>to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

25:47.407 --> 25:49.408
<i>That's just money that could</i>
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

25:49.426 --> 25:51.093
I understand,

25:51.127 --> 25:52.911
but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

25:52.929 --> 25:55.414
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street,

25:55.432 --> 25:58.250
Fring's gang is still operational,
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

25:58.268 --> 25:59.584
It's that simple.

25:59.603 --> 26:01.586
<i>I believe you.</i>
<i>But so what?</i>

26:01.605 --> 26:03.588
<i>It's one case out of dozens,</i>

26:03.607 --> 26:06.558
<i>and you don't play favorites with it
just because it used to be yours.</i>

26:06.592 --> 26:08.560
- I really think that--
<i>- Don't play favorites with it, Hank.</i>

26:08.594 --> 26:10.429
<i>You got a bigger job than that.</i>

26:10.447 --> 26:12.431
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

26:12.449 --> 26:14.933
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

26:14.951 --> 26:17.236
That was an error in judgment.

26:17.270 --> 26:19.288
- Won't happen again.
<i>- You're damn right it won't.</i>

26:19.322 --> 26:21.290
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>
<i>this for you.</i>

26:21.324 --> 26:24.326
<i>The surveillance budget</i>
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

26:24.377 --> 26:26.412
<i>We clear?</i>

26:26.446 --> 26:29.298
Sure. Thank you.

26:29.332 --> 26:31.350
- Clear.
<i>- Good.</i>

26:31.384 --> 26:33.385
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

26:42.846 --> 26:45.514
Yeah?

26:46.966 --> 26:48.633
Hey.

26:54.474 --> 26:57.242
So, Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

26:57.277 --> 26:59.161
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

26:59.195 --> 27:01.113
Yeah.
Something like that.

27:01.147 --> 27:04.033
No more following Ehrmantraut.

27:04.084 --> 27:07.619
Not worth
the financial investment.

27:07.653 --> 27:09.838
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

27:09.873 --> 27:12.324
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

27:12.342 --> 27:14.343
He's just living
a boring old-man life

27:14.377 --> 27:16.929
like he has nothing left
to hide.

27:16.963 --> 27:18.964
And none of Fring's crew
is talking?

27:18.998 --> 27:20.632
Not giving an inch.

27:20.666 --> 27:22.718
You sweeten the pot enough?

27:22.769 --> 27:26.021
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

27:26.056 --> 27:28.173
Not that, but close.

27:28.191 --> 27:29.841
Nobody wants to bite.

27:29.859 --> 27:31.176
Christ!

27:31.194 --> 27:33.278
They're either the most
loyal crew in history,

27:33.313 --> 27:34.947
or someone's
still paying them off.

27:34.981 --> 27:36.281
You still checking
bank records?

27:36.316 --> 27:37.700
No one living
beyond their means.

27:37.734 --> 27:39.651
Nine perps...

27:39.685 --> 27:41.904
All being represented
by one lawyer.

27:41.955 --> 27:44.189
Not unusual
in a case like this.

27:44.207 --> 27:46.191
Yeah, this guy--
What's his name?

27:46.209 --> 27:49.078
Daniel Wachsberger?

27:49.129 --> 27:52.214
He represents every one
of these douchebags

27:52.248 --> 27:54.533
except for Ehrmantraut.

27:54.551 --> 27:56.868
Can we find out
more about the lawyer?

27:56.886 --> 27:59.138
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

27:59.172 --> 28:01.724
Like the shit ain't deep
enough for you already?

28:01.758 --> 28:03.726
Hey, Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.228
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

28:07.230 --> 28:08.713
Do it.

28:08.732 --> 28:11.233
You're the boss.

28:37.410 --> 28:40.129
All right.
Shall we get started?

28:40.180 --> 28:42.131
Now, I know that most of this,

28:42.182 --> 28:44.550
or all of this,
is gonna be new to you.

28:44.584 --> 28:48.137
But, uh, did you take
chemistry in high school?

28:48.188 --> 28:49.471
Just basic?

28:49.522 --> 28:51.807
No.

28:51.858 --> 28:53.809
Okay.
That's all right.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.612
As we go, I'll be as
detailed as possible

28:56.646 --> 28:58.781
without being overwhelming.

28:58.815 --> 29:01.483
Yes, sir.

29:04.103 --> 29:06.038
Look, Todd,
I-I don't need you

29:06.072 --> 29:08.657
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.909
Uh, what I do need

29:10.943 --> 29:13.245
is your full effort
and attention.

29:13.279 --> 29:15.581
Listen and apply yourself.

29:15.615 --> 29:18.584
If you do that,
then we just might have

29:18.618 --> 29:21.119
a fighting chance here, okay?

29:24.123 --> 29:26.625
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:26.643 --> 29:30.312
Well, here we go.

29:42.525 --> 29:46.028
Slowly. Steady.

29:59.825 --> 30:03.262
The aluminum helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

30:08.384 --> 30:13.138
Gently pour it in.
No spilling.

30:53.897 --> 30:55.380
<i>You're gonna like</i>
<i>the Little Schticky,</i>

30:55.398 --> 30:57.048
<i>but you're gonna love</i>
<i>the Big Schhticky.</i>

30:57.066 --> 30:59.551
<i>For bigger messes like dust
bunnies under the bed</i>

30:59.569 --> 31:01.353
<i>or picking up after...</i>

31:40.693 --> 31:42.644
Now...

31:42.695 --> 31:45.948
The CO2 freezes the liquid,

31:45.982 --> 31:47.950
crystallizing it,

31:47.984 --> 31:51.737
which gives us our
finished methamphetamine.

31:53.272 --> 31:56.708
Now all that's left

31:56.743 --> 31:58.710
is to break it up, weigh it,

31:58.745 --> 32:01.496
and we're done.

32:01.547 --> 32:04.783
Wow. This is, um...

32:04.801 --> 32:06.951
This is complicated.

32:06.970 --> 32:08.953
It's gonna take me
a few more times

32:08.972 --> 32:11.807
to get a grasp on it.

32:11.841 --> 32:13.308
Oh, yeah.

32:13.343 --> 32:15.677
It'll take a few more times.

32:19.015 --> 32:21.099
I do all right?

32:22.518 --> 32:24.486
You did fine, Todd.

32:24.520 --> 32:28.323
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

32:28.358 --> 32:30.359
Now all that's left, I guess,

32:30.410 --> 32:32.361
is to talk money.

32:32.412 --> 32:35.247
We can talk money
once I get this right.

32:38.201 --> 32:40.002
Hmm.

32:45.925 --> 32:48.677
Morning.
Guess what I have.

32:50.179 --> 32:54.216
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

32:55.501 --> 32:58.387
Very nice.
Thank you, Dan.

32:58.438 --> 33:00.939
See? I put little faces
on them.

33:22.879 --> 33:24.496
Hey.

33:26.466 --> 33:27.916
Hey.

33:44.267 --> 33:45.934
All right.

34:08.875 --> 34:10.509
Mm.

34:12.428 --> 34:15.764
I'm, uh-- I'm working
with a new guy now.

34:17.416 --> 34:19.518
And I think that it...

34:19.552 --> 34:21.603
I think it

34:21.637 --> 34:24.688
could possibly work out,

34:24.724 --> 34:26.525
because...

34:31.898 --> 34:34.366
I'm trying, Hank.
I really am. I'm trying,

34:34.400 --> 34:36.985
but there's this...

34:37.036 --> 34:41.206
I mean, it's like I don't
even exist to her.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.743
Well, yeah...

34:44.777 --> 34:46.411
I mean,
I know she's struggling.

34:46.445 --> 34:48.330
I know, but I-- I--

34:48.380 --> 34:49.880
I just don't know what to do.

34:49.916 --> 34:51.917
I mean, what can I do?

34:51.951 --> 34:54.469
Such a mess.

34:55.972 --> 34:57.722
I mean, we--
both of us-- we--

34:57.757 --> 35:01.292
we just have screwed up
so much.

35:03.146 --> 35:05.147
I'm just...

35:05.181 --> 35:06.798
I'm sorry. I don't...

35:06.816 --> 35:09.184
Um, do you-- do you have any coffee?
Maybe I could--

35:09.235 --> 35:10.852
Coffee? You bet.
Yeah. You bet.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.354
What, you take, uh,
cream, right?

35:12.405 --> 35:13.738
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:48.357 --> 35:50.108
All right.
Here you go buddy.

35:50.142 --> 35:52.010
- Oh, thank you, Hank.
- Yeah.

35:52.028 --> 35:55.013
Look, I'm sorry to waste
your time with all this.

35:55.031 --> 35:57.115
- Ah, no.
- It's really...

35:57.149 --> 35:59.150
- It's... You know.
- Yeah.

35:59.184 --> 36:01.036
Yeah.

36:04.857 --> 36:06.858
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

36:06.876 --> 36:08.577
Hey, could you excuse me?

36:08.628 --> 36:10.962
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

36:10.997 --> 36:12.714
- Tell me something good.
- You tell me.

36:12.748 --> 36:14.382
I sweated the guy for 14 hours.

36:14.417 --> 36:15.884
That should be
some kind of record.

36:15.918 --> 36:18.202
Quit your bragging.
What'd you get?

36:18.221 --> 36:21.706
He's gonna do it.
He's gonna flip.

36:21.724 --> 36:23.708
He's willing
to give us Ehrmantraut?

36:27.046 --> 36:28.930
What are you wasting
your time for?

36:28.981 --> 36:30.932
Go throw a net around
that son of a bitch.

36:30.983 --> 36:32.434
All right.

37:02.985 --> 37:05.087
- Yeah?
<i>- Mike, hey, it's me.</i>

37:05.121 --> 37:06.755
<i>- Can you talk?</i>
- I can.

37:06.789 --> 37:09.675
<i>Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.</i>

37:09.709 --> 37:11.826
<i>I don't want to do this</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

37:11.844 --> 37:13.328
<i>Are you available?</i>

37:13.346 --> 37:15.330
I can come by in a few hours.

37:15.348 --> 37:17.799
<i>That's not good for me.</i>
<i>Where are you now?</i>

37:17.833 --> 37:20.335
I'm at the park
with my granddaughter.

37:20.370 --> 37:23.221
<i>- Where exactly?</i>
- Palomita.

37:23.272 --> 37:24.723
<i>Oh, you know what?</i>
<i>I'm not far.</i>

37:24.774 --> 37:26.391
<i>I'll come to you.</i>
<i>You just hang tight.</i>

37:34.534 --> 37:36.851
Yeah?

37:36.869 --> 37:38.987
<i>Mike, they're coming for you.
Right now. They're coming.</i>

37:39.021 --> 37:41.206
- Slow down, Walter. Who?
<i>- The DEA.</i>

37:41.240 --> 37:43.692
<i>The DE--</i>
<i>Somebody flipped.</i>

37:43.710 --> 37:46.712
<i>They have, uh, some--</i>
<i>some kind of bank surveillance.</i>

37:46.746 --> 37:48.697
<i>And something</i>
<i>about some lawyer.</i>

37:48.715 --> 37:52.000
<i>Someone is talking, Mike, and
they're coming for you right now.</i>

38:41.250 --> 38:44.936
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

38:44.971 --> 38:46.888
Dan Wachsberger.

38:46.922 --> 38:50.258
He would've had better luck with the
law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

38:50.276 --> 38:53.028
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

38:53.062 --> 38:55.430
All right, Saul.
Enough, please.

38:55.448 --> 38:57.816
Instead of just sitting
around here, what can we do?

38:57.867 --> 39:01.453
Besides pray that he gets away?
I'm open to ideas.

39:01.487 --> 39:03.705
Because if the DEA
catches up with him,

39:03.740 --> 39:07.108
and he flips,
it's good night, John-boy.

39:07.126 --> 39:10.829
No. No way Mike
would ever flip, okay?

39:10.880 --> 39:12.964
- No way.
- Yeah, yeah.

39:12.999 --> 39:15.300
Never say never.

39:15.334 --> 39:18.887
This is the second time
the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.555
You know?

39:20.590 --> 39:22.624
Jesus, fool me once, right?

39:22.642 --> 39:23.958
Look, he won't flip.

39:25.595 --> 39:27.596
But his nine guys will.

39:44.113 --> 39:46.832
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
It's him.

39:48.534 --> 39:50.452
Uh, Mike,

39:50.486 --> 39:53.004
uh, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

39:53.039 --> 39:54.790
<i>- The what?</i>
- The, uh...

39:54.824 --> 39:56.675
Walt and Jesse are here.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.343
<i>I don't want Walt</i>
<i>and Jesse, Saul.</i>

39:58.377 --> 40:00.679
<i>- I want you. I need your help.</i>
- What do you need?

40:00.713 --> 40:03.014
I got a go-bag
at the airport--

40:03.049 --> 40:05.684
passports, money--
but there are eyes everywhere.

40:05.718 --> 40:07.435
I can't get close.

40:07.470 --> 40:09.504
I need you to pick up that bag

40:09.522 --> 40:11.640
and get it to me
as soon as possible.

40:11.674 --> 40:14.476
Do you know how thick the crap storm
is out there because of this?

40:14.510 --> 40:16.645
I told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

40:16.679 --> 40:19.281
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
<i>- Hey, Mike,</i>

40:19.315 --> 40:20.816
I can get it to you, all right?

40:20.850 --> 40:23.685
- Just tell me what to do.
<i>- No, kid. Not you.</i>

40:23.703 --> 40:26.955
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

40:26.989 --> 40:29.658
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you,

40:29.692 --> 40:31.660
so they're probably
sitting on my car right now,

40:31.694 --> 40:33.712
hoping I do something stupid.

40:33.746 --> 40:35.864
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

40:35.882 --> 40:36.882
No, Jesse.

40:36.916 --> 40:38.216
Jesus, I'll do it.

40:38.251 --> 40:40.836
Besides, you're out, remember?

40:40.870 --> 40:42.871
Mike, tell me where
to get this bag.

41:56.612 --> 41:58.847
Hello, Walter.

42:00.516 --> 42:02.751
Before I hand this over,

42:02.785 --> 42:04.286
I need something from you.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.687
And what's that?

42:05.721 --> 42:07.923
The names of your nine men.

42:07.957 --> 42:10.725
Why?

42:10.760 --> 42:13.261
You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

42:13.295 --> 42:16.514
The point is, Mike,
it affects me.

42:16.565 --> 42:20.101
It affects Jesse, too,
and we deserve to know.

42:20.135 --> 42:23.104
The only thing left
to do now is leave town.

42:23.139 --> 42:24.606
You understand?

42:24.640 --> 42:26.808
"Leave town." Wow.

42:26.842 --> 42:30.645
Yeah, I just can't up and
leave, like you, Mike.

42:30.680 --> 42:34.148
I've got a family.
I've got people who depend on me.

42:34.166 --> 42:36.117
Yeah.

42:51.267 --> 42:53.601
Good-bye, Walter.

42:55.671 --> 42:58.373
You're welcome!

43:02.178 --> 43:04.145
I'm sorry, what?

43:04.180 --> 43:06.698
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

43:06.732 --> 43:08.700
I don't owe you a damn thing.

43:08.734 --> 43:12.520
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

43:12.538 --> 43:14.022
Wow.

43:14.040 --> 43:15.957
Wow!

43:15.992 --> 43:19.044
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

43:19.078 --> 43:22.247
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

43:22.298 --> 43:24.582
and now, suddenly,
this is all my fault?

43:24.633 --> 43:26.251
Why don't you walk me
through this, Mike?

43:26.302 --> 43:29.304
We had a good thing,
you stupid son of a bitch!

43:29.338 --> 43:31.756
We had Fring.
We had a lab.

43:31.807 --> 43:34.676
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

43:34.710 --> 43:36.678
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth,

43:36.712 --> 43:39.931
cooked, and made as much
money as you ever needed.

43:39.982 --> 43:43.551
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

43:43.569 --> 43:46.220
You and your pride
and your ego!

43:46.238 --> 43:48.523
You just had to be the man.

43:48.557 --> 43:51.192
If you'd done your job,
known your place,

43:51.226 --> 43:53.411
we'd all be fine right now!

46:07.329 --> 46:09.747
I just...

46:09.798 --> 46:12.133
I just realized
that Lydia has the names.

46:12.168 --> 46:14.419
I can get them from her.

46:19.091 --> 46:21.142
I'm sorry, Mike.

46:22.678 --> 46:26.014
This-- this whole thing
could've been avoided--

46:26.048 --> 46:28.566
Shut the fuck up.

46:31.403 --> 46:33.938
Let me die in peace.
