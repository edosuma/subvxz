WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:05.773
I got in.
I got in!

00:05.806 --> 00:07.375
Congratulations.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.710
You know how to use
a swinging door.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.813
No, I got accepted
to Stanford!

00:12.846 --> 00:14.014
(SHRIEKS)

00:16.184 --> 00:18.286
I'm so proud of you.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.354
Molly, you worked
so hard for this
your whole life.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.256
I can't believe
this is actually
gonna happen.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.457
I know,
me neither.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.226
I also have
some big news.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.262
I got accepted into
Coffee Bean's VIP program.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.466
Grandpa, can you get me
a free latte?

00:32.966 --> 00:34.001
No.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.505
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
Oh.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.374
Random number
at dinner?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.310
It's probably
a telemarketer.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.245
What?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.747
Hi, is this Ken Park?
DR. KEN: Maybe.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.849
Uh, well, this is Dan Harmon.
I'm a TV producer.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.618
I was hoping to have Ken
audition for a role

00:50.651 --> 00:52.753
on my new show,
but if this
isn't his number...

00:52.786 --> 00:54.222
Oh, no, no. No, no.
This is he.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.856
(INAUDIBLE)

00:55.889 --> 00:57.891
(BOTH INAUDIBLE)

01:01.462 --> 01:03.197
Yeah, I'm casting
a one-episode role

01:03.231 --> 01:05.799
for a part on a show set
at a community college.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.934
Do you think
you could make it

01:06.967 --> 01:08.802
to audition tomorrow
at 5:00?

01:08.836 --> 01:10.704
Sure.
I can make that work.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.673
Yeah, I just have to move
a few things around and...

01:12.706 --> 01:14.175
I don't care.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.177
How did you
find me anyway?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.212
Oh, my assistant, Steve,
saw you do open mic

01:18.246 --> 01:19.513
at the Laugh Factory.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.848
He says you're funny,
but he also says

01:20.881 --> 01:22.483
he's valuable,
so grain of salt.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.554
Plus, the network keeps
nagging me about diversity,

01:26.587 --> 01:29.089
so I thought I'd...
(MUMBLES)

01:29.123 --> 01:31.259
Well, that's perfect
because I'm Asian.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.261
Wait, well,
I never said that.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.729
Oh, it's okay.
I'm a super-talented person

01:35.763 --> 01:37.498
who happens to be Asian.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.899
Yeah,
I'm a super-busy person

01:38.932 --> 01:41.001
who happens
to be hanging up.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.939
Well, it's a day
of realized dreams.

01:45.973 --> 01:49.042
Thanks, Dad, I...
I'm auditioning
for a TV show!

01:55.516 --> 01:57.084
(CHUCKLES)
Hello.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.419
Hey, hey!

01:58.452 --> 01:59.820
There's the newlywed.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.255
How was
the honeymoon?

02:01.289 --> 02:02.356
Amazing.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.091
Thank you guys so much
for the trip to Catalina.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.326
We snorkeled.
We hiked.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.328
We saw a buffalo
being born.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.729
BOTH: Ah.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.932
Now there's a bucket-list
moment.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.867
I've always
wanted to hike.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.905
Hey, does anyone know
a good florist?

02:17.938 --> 02:19.740
I want to send flowers
to my husband.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.243
You know, back when
Connor and I
were first married...

02:22.276 --> 02:23.944
You mean Saturday?
...I wouldn't have
thought of it,

02:23.977 --> 02:25.246
but now...

02:25.279 --> 02:27.581
I know that a little gift
for no reason

02:27.615 --> 02:28.816
can go a long way.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.619
I'm so happy!

02:32.586 --> 02:33.921
(LAUGHING)
Good for you, Clarky.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.223
Oh, my God.
You guys should get married.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.325
What?
That's insane!

02:37.358 --> 02:38.492
Stand down, Clark,

02:38.526 --> 02:40.961
and park your married
high horse outside.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.264
You'll come around.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.366
Hey, you want to see
a picture of a buffalo
being born?

02:45.399 --> 02:47.635
I've seen that.
Show me hiking.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.338
Oh, would you
look at that.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.209
"Can I help you?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.477
"Was it something
you ate?"

02:58.412 --> 02:59.480
What are you doing?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.681
(INAUDIBLE)

03:02.416 --> 03:05.052
Okay, promise
to keep this a secret.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.854
I have a big audition
this afternoon.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.290
Oh, my God,
that's so great.
What's it for?

03:09.323 --> 03:11.359
A five-line part
on a new TV show.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.526
Oh...

03:12.560 --> 03:13.994
So not like
a big audition.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.596
I am perfect for it.

03:15.629 --> 03:19.267
I play a school nurse
who gets killed by a bus.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.335
Why are you practicing
(SOFTLY) in secret?

03:21.369 --> 03:22.970
Oh, I just don't want
Pat to know

03:23.003 --> 03:24.372
because I have
to leave work early.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.274
Plus, I don't want pity
or embarrassment

03:26.307 --> 03:29.142
if I don't get it,
but now that you know...

03:29.176 --> 03:30.311
Ooh.
Here.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.446
Read everything
that's not nurse one.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.114
Ironic, but okay.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.351
Can I help you?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.587
(IN CHILDLIKE VOICE)
My tummy hurts.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.889
What's with
the baby voice?

03:41.922 --> 03:43.824
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Well, I'm just trying
to put some spin on it.

03:43.857 --> 03:44.925
But it's a set-up line

03:44.958 --> 03:46.360
for "Was it something
you ate?"

03:46.394 --> 03:47.561
That's my big joke
in the scene.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.830
Isn't the joke this line
about how a squirrel

03:49.863 --> 03:51.465
stole your stethoscope?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.801
No, Clark,
that's a plot point.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.968
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:55.002 --> 03:56.437
What you two
knuckleheads up to?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.606
BOTH: Nothing.
(WHISPERING)
Get in here.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.708
What, what,
what?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.343
Okay,
but you can't tell Pat.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.011
Please, keeping secrets
from your boyfriend

04:04.044 --> 04:05.346
is part of the fun
of being in
a relationship.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.282
What we doing?
What we doing?

04:08.316 --> 04:09.850
Okay, I have an audition
in an hour,

04:09.883 --> 04:11.151
and I'm learning lines.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.520
Oh, you know, what?
Here.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.821
You are now
the student character

04:13.854 --> 04:17.358
that some people
have trouble grasping.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.227
Warning. Don't make
strong acting choices.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.998
"My tummy hurts."

04:25.032 --> 04:27.134
(SING SONG) Was it
something you ate?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.738
Oh, Lord,
you're gonna
do it like that?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.005
That's what
makes it a joke.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.107
I don't think so.
Why are you
fighting me on this?

04:34.141 --> 04:35.443
That's the next line,
dummy!

04:35.476 --> 04:36.977
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

04:43.984 --> 04:45.786
Hey.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.755
Hey, hey, Pat.
Um...

04:47.788 --> 04:51.224
We were just helping Ken
practice his bedside manner.

04:51.258 --> 04:55.563
Yeah, you know,
got to keep those
people skills sharp.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.897
Ken, I'm glad you
acknowledge your need

04:56.930 --> 04:58.332
for vast improvement
in that area.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.901
Carry on.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.705
See, that was fun.
Thank you, guys.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.839
Look,
I don't want Pat thinking

05:05.873 --> 05:07.641
I'm not 100% committed
to medicine,

05:07.675 --> 05:09.743
because I take it
very seriously.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.345
Now, tell me if this
is the right
facial expression

05:11.379 --> 05:12.613
for getting hit
by a bus.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.090
Anyone seen Dr. Park?
The boy one?

05:23.123 --> 05:25.058
There's some paperwork
for him to finish.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.259
Um, you know what?

05:26.293 --> 05:27.861
He went up to the roof

05:27.895 --> 05:29.830
'cause he's testing
a patient

05:29.863 --> 05:31.565
who is allergic to birds.
Got to go. Bye.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.002
Hmm.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.504
Hey, Clark.
Yeah.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.338
Is it just me,
or was Damona

05:38.372 --> 05:40.608
particularly evasive
just now?

05:40.641 --> 05:41.675
(SIGHS)

05:41.709 --> 05:43.210
Okay, look.
Pat, Ken is...

05:43.243 --> 05:44.478
Is she mad at me
about shutting down

05:44.512 --> 05:46.580
the idea of us
getting engaged so quickly?

05:47.548 --> 05:48.816
Oh, that.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.319
Yes, that is
definitely it.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.423
Ah, see, that's exactly
what I was afraid of.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.658
I mean, I know
you love being married.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.092
Oh, it's like getting
to have sleepovers

05:59.126 --> 06:02.129
with your best friend
for eternity!

06:02.162 --> 06:05.499
Ah, Clark,
your joy is exhausting.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.900
Yeah.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.502
Look, I went down
the marriage road

06:08.536 --> 06:10.504
once before with Tiffany,
and it was hard.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.441
Yeah, 'cause Tiffany
was a monster.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.143
Yeah.
See, that's the thing.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.377
She wasn't at first.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.912
No, I was more
in love with her

06:18.946 --> 06:21.314
than I had ever been
with anyone else.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.551
Marriage
somehow broke us.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.986
I never fully
got over it.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.387
You know, the other day
she e-mailed me,

06:27.421 --> 06:28.756
and I practically
froze up.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.424
Oh, my God.
Did you e-mail her back?

06:30.458 --> 06:31.859
No, I told you.
I froze up!

06:33.694 --> 06:35.028
I'm just worried
that marriage

06:35.062 --> 06:37.097
would do the same thing
to me and Damona.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.932
But Damona's not Tiffany.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.601
I know that.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.302
And I love Damona.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.204
But...

06:44.237 --> 06:45.973
I think my desire
to take things slow

06:46.006 --> 06:47.975
to protect her
is not sitting well with her.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.310
You know, Pat,
if I could offer you

06:50.343 --> 06:53.146
some wisdom gleaned
from my union with Connor.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.616
Relationships are...

06:55.649 --> 06:57.951
They're like
a water bug on ice.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.720
You skitter... Pat?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.959
Hey, mom.
Are you coming from work?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.127
'Cause with that glow,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.296
I'd swear you spent
the day at the spa.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.298
You want something.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.866
What? Please.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.234
Can't a kid
hook his old lady up

07:14.267 --> 07:15.703
with a compliment?

07:16.303 --> 07:18.071
Okay, thanks.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.306
But there is one thing.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.610
When Molly
leaves for college,
can I have her room?

07:22.643 --> 07:25.412
No. Dave,
I'm not even talking
about this right now.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.014
I knew you didn't
go to the spa.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.486
What are you doing?
Measuring Molly's room.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.854
I'm taking it
when she's gone.

07:34.888 --> 07:35.923
He can't!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.491
It's eight steps
closer to the bathroom,

07:37.525 --> 07:39.259
and I've had
too many close calls.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.329
This isn't over,
Grandpa!

07:44.464 --> 07:47.267
She's not leaving
for another four months!
(BLOWS A RASPBERRY)

07:47.300 --> 07:49.803
(CHUCKLES)

07:49.837 --> 07:51.605
(SOBBING)
She's leaving
in four months.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.240
(CRYING)

07:57.477 --> 07:59.547
Hi, uh, Ken Park
auditioning for nurse one.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.981
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Dan Harmon.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.016
This is my assistant, Steve.
This is Alison.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.251
She's already been cast
to the show,

08:04.284 --> 08:06.286
so she'll be reading
the scene with you today.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.621
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.389
Um, my wife's name
is Allison,

08:09.422 --> 08:11.124
so I'm very comfortable

08:11.158 --> 08:13.794
with any level
of intimacy.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.930
Oh, this scene
doesn't really call
for any intimacy.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.666
We'll see.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.235
Okay,
creepy start.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.404
Uh, just go
when you're ready.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.206
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:26.239 --> 08:27.808
Can I help you?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.077
(IN CHILDLIKE VOICE)
My tummy hurts.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.912
(LAUGHS) I told you.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.217
(SING SONG) Was it
something you ate?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.088
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Wow. Okay.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.290
Um,
I don't think so.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.593
Well, a squirrel ran off
with my stethoscope,

08:45.626 --> 08:48.028
so we're going to
have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.529
Okay, thank you.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.931
I... I didn't finish.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.065
You're welcome.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.502
(SING SONG) Bye.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.240
You know what?

09:01.474 --> 09:02.743
No.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.613
I've waited my whole life
for this moment,

09:05.646 --> 09:08.281
and I'm not gonna let
a medically reckless scene

09:08.315 --> 09:10.550
that barely gives me
anything to showcase

09:10.584 --> 09:12.152
my broad appeal
take me down.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.222
(STERNLY)
Can I help you?

09:19.593 --> 09:20.861
My tummy hurts?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.930
(SING SONG) Was it
something you ate?

09:24.732 --> 09:25.966
I don't think so.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.835
Look, lady,

09:27.868 --> 09:31.304
I've been the school nurse
here for 20 years.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.574
And I've seen my fair share
of tummy aches.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.811
Usually, it's something
you ate on leftover day

09:37.845 --> 09:39.146
in the cafeteria,

09:39.179 --> 09:43.617
but today
isn't leftover day,
Your Honor, is it?

09:43.651 --> 09:44.985
Is it?

09:46.186 --> 09:49.056
None of those lines
are in here.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.958
Then where does that
leave us?

09:50.991 --> 09:52.893
Ulcers? Gallstones?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.328
A stab wound?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.631
(INAUDIBLE)

09:57.665 --> 09:59.299
(GROWLS)

09:59.332 --> 10:00.901
Yeah,
I don't feel safe.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.505
Look, a squirrel
took my stethoscope!

10:05.538 --> 10:07.808
Thank God, I survived.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.944
But luckily,
I don't need a stethoscope

10:10.978 --> 10:13.346
to diagnose
why your tummy hurts.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.350
Because,
my dear girl,

10:17.384 --> 10:19.887
you're pregnant.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.922
Congratulations.
You're going to make
an excellent mother.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.992
And screen.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.763

10:30.497 --> 10:32.365
That was
a closet door.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.736

10:36.303 --> 10:37.437
I liked him.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.120
(CELLPHONE RINGS)

10:53.153 --> 10:55.422
Hey, how'd it go?
DR. KEN: Totally bombed.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.057
Oh, Ken, I'm sorry.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.358
What a waste.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.862
Who cares about stupid
showbiz anyway?

11:01.895 --> 11:05.432
Oh, my God. Seth Rogen
and some random guy.

11:05.465 --> 11:09.202
Uh, this guy actually
hand-picks my socks
every single morning.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.270
I know what fits.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.940
In this situation,
you're some random guy.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.211
I'm sorry you married
such a loser.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.714
Are you kidding?
I'm so proud of you.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.283
You worked hard.
You put yourself out there.

11:23.316 --> 11:27.020
(SIGHS) I love you
so much, Ken.
No matter what happens,

11:27.054 --> 11:29.156
I'll always
be here for you.
Shut up. It's Dan.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.161
Hey, Dan,
I'm sorry about my audition.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.329
Oh, God, you should be.
It was horrible.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.431
Um, but listen,
as a writer,

11:38.465 --> 11:41.301
I look for ways
to challenge the audience.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.702
Sometimes punish them.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.606
Um, let me bottle your crazy
and shake it

11:46.639 --> 11:47.908
and spray it
on America's face

11:47.941 --> 11:49.810
and then run away
laughing

11:49.843 --> 11:51.178
as they claw
at their eyes screaming,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.679
"Why? Why?
What did I just see?"

11:54.147 --> 11:55.548
I want to put you
on the show.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.850
Really?
Really.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.351
Really?
Really.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.687
Really?
Okay, you don't have to
show me your whole range.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.355
(CHUCKLES)

12:02.389 --> 12:04.892
Steve, there's an actor
on my shirt.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.569
Hey.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.704
'Sup?

12:20.974 --> 12:21.975
What are you
watching?

12:23.210 --> 12:25.012
Alien vs. Predator.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.280
It's so good.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.984
Okay, what's really
going on, Mom?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.252
(SIGHS)

12:32.585 --> 12:33.854
Look...

12:33.887 --> 12:37.257
I'm thrilled you got into
Stanford, but...

12:38.358 --> 12:40.760
I've been dreading this
for 18 years.
(CHUCKLES)

12:41.561 --> 12:44.131
Aw! Mom.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.667
You've become such
an amazing young woman
and...

12:47.700 --> 12:49.636
and a really
close friend.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.805
And I can't help
but think if I'd done

12:51.839 --> 12:53.874
a little worse job
raising you

12:53.907 --> 12:57.244
or let your Dad
do more,

12:57.277 --> 12:59.980
maybe you wouldn't have
gotten into any schools

13:00.013 --> 13:02.549
and you'd have
to keep living with us.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.852
Okay, the flight's
only an hour,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.954
and once I graduate,
who knows?

13:06.987 --> 13:10.023
These days, a lot of kids
are moving back home
after college.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.225
I won't even charge you
a high rent.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.128
Though,
when you do return,

13:15.162 --> 13:18.065
you might have trouble
getting your room back.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.466
I'll sleep on the floor

13:19.499 --> 13:20.901
if it means getting
to spend time with you.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.005
I love you, Mom.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
I love you, too.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.811
Hey.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.247
Hey.
What are these for?

13:34.281 --> 13:37.250
Well, I was worried
you were upset with me

13:37.284 --> 13:38.451
for shutting down
the idea

13:38.485 --> 13:40.187
of getting engaged
so quickly.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.821
No, no, no.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.157
We just got to a good place
in our relationship.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.259
We don't need to rush
to the next step.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.229
Yeah, well, then why
have you been
so standoffish all day?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.698
Oh. Ah, ugh.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.568
Um, I was covering
for Ken.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.970
He had an audition today,

13:57.004 --> 13:58.471
and he didn't want
you to know about it.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.173
Ah, so you weren't
mad at me.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.675
You were just being
dishonest with me.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.312
That is such a relief.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.347
(CHUCKLES)

14:07.380 --> 14:09.950
Mmm.
You and me,
we're good.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.351
Yeah.
Okay?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.720
I am going to go
find a vase for these.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.423
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
Thank you.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.392
Oh, Ken is in the basement
with a pony, and...

14:19.426 --> 14:20.760
It's okay,
he knows about it.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.864
So, are you
upset with Ken?

14:24.898 --> 14:27.834
You should know that
he's super-committed
to medicine.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.203
How can I be mad at a man
for setting aside his fears

14:30.237 --> 14:31.471
and pursuing his dream?

14:31.504 --> 14:34.141
Ken's not the only one
who could do that.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.542
Hint, hint.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.945
Damona, Damona.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.113
You know, Clark?

14:40.147 --> 14:43.316
Maybe the idea of me
marrying Damona
isn't so crazy.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.652
Despite how complicated
things got
between me and...

14:45.685 --> 14:48.221
Tiffany?
Hmm, there you go.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.489
Not really sure why
that last part

14:49.522 --> 14:50.790
sounded like a question.
Hmm.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.595
Tiffany.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.665
(STUTTERS) What are you
doing here?

14:58.698 --> 15:02.535
I e-mailed you,
but I never heard back.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.405
Are you still
therealpatrice@willtopia.com?

15:07.840 --> 15:11.344
I am so sorry how things
turned out with us.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.581
But I've been doing
some real work on myself.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.385
And I want to try again.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.054
I want you back.
I love you, Pat.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.026
Oh, boy.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.135

I got the part!

15:40.307 --> 15:43.010
Just remember.
No accent.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.078
Only good
for cheap laughs.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.180
CLARK: Okay.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.682
Hey, we couldn't wait
until tomorrow
to find out.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.351
Congratulations.

There's another cake
in there that says

15:52.652 --> 15:53.653
"Better luck next time."

Oh.

I wasn't more open
about all this.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.095
Ah, don't worry about it.
I'm proud of you.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.196
Yeah, me too.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.731
Although,
after your episode airs,

16:04.764 --> 16:07.234
I have a feeling
you're gonna be hard...er
to work with.

you've changed already.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.409
(LAUGHS) Hello?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.145
Yes, it would be an honor

16:18.178 --> 16:20.080
to hold for Dan Harm...
Okay.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.350
Hey,
I've been thinking.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.917
I should act my age.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.819
You can have Molly's room
when she leaves.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.955
No, Grandpa,
I, too, have been thinking.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.490
You should take it.
Okay.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.625
I will. (LAUGHS)

16:33.526 --> 16:35.728
Dave, looks like
you just got played.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.297
Quite the contrary.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.799
I've had my eye
on Grandpa's room
since he moved in.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.934
Making your room
seem desirable

16:41.968 --> 16:44.137
was just one domino
that needed to fall.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.775
Hey. You okay?

16:48.808 --> 16:50.143
Oh, yeah,
never better.

I'm glad I caught you.

Oh, yeah. I was just
celebrating with my
friends and family.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.119
I don't care.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.654
Yeah, I was just thinking
about the character
I want you to play.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.023
I want you to be
a Spanish professor
that's a little crazy,

17:04.057 --> 17:05.992
a little nutty,
like you were
in the audition.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.628
And I want you to be
in every episode.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.366
Seriously?
Seriously.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.302
I hope you're ready
to quit your day job,

you shouldn't.

Uh, guys?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.948
Let me guess.
They realized
they made a mistake

17:28.981 --> 17:31.184
and changed their mind?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.386
Did they give the part
to John Cho?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.955
My God, though,
he is so talented.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.625
(OVERLAPPING CONVERSATION)

17:38.658 --> 17:41.594
No, no. Uh...

17:42.695 --> 17:45.232
They want me to be
a series regular.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.801

I'd have to quit my job.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.238
Oh.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.740
This is so surreal.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.743
Pat, is there any way

17:56.776 --> 17:58.044
I could take
a leave of absence

17:58.077 --> 17:59.479
in case
it doesn't work out?

17:59.512 --> 18:02.582
No, sorry,
I wish there were,
but unfortunately,

18:02.615 --> 18:04.684
we'd have to replace you
right away.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.686
Ah, two years ago,
that would have been

18:06.719 --> 18:08.821
music to my ears,
but now...

18:09.989 --> 18:12.625
Guess I've built up
a tolerance to you.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.364
No.
I can't do this.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.531
It's just like
stand-up last year.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.167
It's too risky.
It'll change everything.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.902
Ken, this year has been
full of changes.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.438
I switched jobs.
Your parents got divorced.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.707
Ain't nobody
gonna tie me down.

18:29.142 --> 18:32.812
My point is
change isn't bad.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.214
Molly's gonna
go off to Stanford.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.915
That's a huge change.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.717
But Molly's supposed
to go to college.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.286
46-year-old doctors
aren't supposed

18:39.319 --> 18:41.988
to trade their lab coats in
for a sombrero.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.358
I'd play a Spanish teacher
with an anger problem.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.427
At least it's
in your wheelhouse.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.263
Except for
the Spanish part.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.833
Hey, Ken, you know
we do support you
on this, right?

18:53.866 --> 18:56.703
Yeah, I mean,
we'd really Miss you,

18:56.736 --> 19:00.139
but this is an amazing
opportunity for you.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.343
Yeah. I love working
with you guys.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.346
It... And you know,
I make a difference

19:06.379 --> 19:09.182
in hundreds
of patients' lives,
thousands.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.585
Dad,
what do you think?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.521
Hundreds.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.992
Son, I've always said
that you need the support

19:20.026 --> 19:22.762
of your family
for a decision like this.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.431
This is your family.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.366
It matters
what they think.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.836
I'm 11, so I'm gonna
yield my time to mom.

19:29.869 --> 19:33.139
Ken, if my cancer scare
has taught me anything,

19:33.172 --> 19:35.542
it's that life is short.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.876
You have
an opportunity here

19:36.909 --> 19:38.411
that may
never come again.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.247
Yeah, but I have
responsibilities as a...

19:40.280 --> 19:42.349
We have
responsibilities.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.251
And we'll make it work.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.019
When you look back
in 20 years,

19:47.053 --> 19:48.321
are you really
gonna be happy

19:48.355 --> 19:50.357
if you didn't take a shot
at the one thing

19:50.390 --> 19:52.592
you always said
you wanted to do?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.263
What if this
doesn't work out?

19:57.664 --> 19:59.432
But what if it does?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.835
I love you so much.
(SQUEALS)

20:03.436 --> 20:04.671
I'm gonna do it.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.706
I'm gonna do it!
Love you guys.
(ALL CHEERING)

20:06.739 --> 20:08.675
DR. KEN:
Love you guys so much.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.477
Yay!

20:10.510 --> 20:12.579
Now let's have
some cake.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.113
Oh, uh,
is it gluten free?

20:14.146 --> 20:16.048
Because
I'm an actor now.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.251
Oh, God.
Here we go.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.256
Huh, I know
what you're thinking.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.892
Something doesn't look
right here, does it?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.394
You're probably like,
(WITH SPANISH ACCENT)
"Dios mio,

20:27.427 --> 20:31.431
I thought this
was Spanish class, brah."

20:31.464 --> 20:35.568
(IN NASAL VOICE)
"Ah, look at me.
Little Miss Sunshine, uh-huh.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.803
"Ay caramba.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.607
"Oh, what's a guy like him
doing up there, huh? Huh?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.542
"Huh? Huh?"

20:42.575 --> 20:44.477
(LAUGHS)

20:44.511 --> 20:46.078
Sorry, sorry.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.714
Alison just made me
laugh again. That's all.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.350
My bad for reacting
in the scene.

20:51.984 --> 20:55.187
Dan, that was funny.
You should film her, too.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.323
Oh, we're gonna.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.024
After you do one take
without laughing.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.926
(LAUGHS)

20:59.959 --> 21:01.894
Ah, that's gonna
be tough to do.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.497
Got an hour
of unusable tape
to prove that.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.099
Why don't we take five?

21:07.133 --> 21:08.635
Everybody,
call your families.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.169
(BELL RINGS)

21:10.970 --> 21:12.071
I'm gonna
hang out on my mark,

21:12.104 --> 21:14.073
kind of in the zone.
(LAUGHS)

21:14.106 --> 21:15.908
It's gonna be
a long year.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.310
Yep.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.646
Should we reach out
to John Cho?

21:22.749 --> 21:24.283
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.621
Living the dream.
