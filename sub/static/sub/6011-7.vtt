01:06.120 --> 01:08.714
His lordship is going to America.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.554
- What are you talking about?
- A telegram has just arrived.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.198
He's leaving today.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.589
Something's happened
to her ladyship's brother.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.759
So, you mean you have to go too.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.354
I can't leave Anna, Mrs Hughes. Not now.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.634
How can she put me in this position?
It's not fair!

01:27.720 --> 01:28.709
I agree.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.472
But why
does your mother need me?

01:30.560 --> 01:32.278
"Robert must be there." Why?

01:32.360 --> 01:34.112
My being there won't make any difference.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.633
They obviously feel it will.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.955
Maybe they don't want the Senate Committee
to think Harold is some sort of wildcat driller.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.634
And an English earl as a brother-in-law
will make him respectable?

01:43.080 --> 01:44.274
They seem to believe so.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.591
I know plenty of relatives of
English earls who belong in jail!

01:49.480 --> 01:51.516
I suppose we've made the decision.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.110
I can't stop his lordship from going.

01:54.200 --> 01:58.876
Of course not. But I wonder if it's necessary
for Mr Bates to go with him.

01:59.240 --> 02:03.199
It'll be very hard for Anna
to lose his support at this time.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.748
Mrs Hughes, I hope we are good employers.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.749
But even we expect to get what we pay for.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.308
Bates is in this house as his lordship's valet.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.993
I know that, m'lady.
But this is a special circumstance.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.993
Why, particularly?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.231
It's not my secret to tell.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.071
If you wish to enlist my help,
I must know the facts.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.033
I won't go.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.479
I see.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.599
So you'll leave his lordship in the lurch,
and probably lose your job,

02:38.680 --> 02:40.193
and all this to help me?

02:42.400 --> 02:43.833
Go home and pack.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.989
You are asking me to travel without a valet?

02:59.080 --> 03:01.196
I'm asking you not to take Bates.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.554
You do know the Americans have

03:02.640 --> 03:05.552
a correct uniform for practically
every activity known to man?

03:05.640 --> 03:08.234
But Thomas was your valet
the whole time Bates was in prison.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.639
He knows how you like things done.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.312
Well, suppose he doesn't want to go?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.675
Why wouldn't he? It's an adventure.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.479
All those handsome stewards
strutting down the boat deck.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.796
Don't be vulgar.
What do you know of such matters?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.351
I've been married. I know everything.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.989
But if you could just explain
why Bates can't come.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.798
I can't explain it.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.110
If I could, you'd agree with me.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.716
I found this for the shoes, m'lord.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.189
I'm afraid it seems
you won't be coming with me, Bates.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.271
Thomas has been selected as your deputy.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.275
- What?
- Lady Mary has persuaded me

03:43.360 --> 03:45.715
you're more needed here,
though why, I couldn't tell you.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.079
I'd better get on. Your grandmother
will arrive shortly, if she hasn't already.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.108
What have they told you?

04:01.120 --> 04:02.348
That Anna was...

04:03.880 --> 04:07.190
...attacked by some ruffian who'd broken in.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.510
While I sat upstairs, enjoying the music.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.796
It's not your fault, Bates.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.149
It wasn't hers, but it wasn't yours.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.834
Thank you.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.077
I thought I'd come to wish Lord Grantham
good luck on his journey.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.673
He's upstairs getting ready, m'lady.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.718
- Everyone else is in the library.
- Oh, Rose, my dear...

04:35.800 --> 04:39.270
I wonder, I wonder if I might
please have a glass of water?

04:39.840 --> 04:40.989
Thank you.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.836
Judging how things are going,
he can manage very well.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.397
Oh? Are we disturbing the conclave?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.232
We're just discussing the pigs.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.074
Ah, the arrival of the pigs
and the departure of their master.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.230
It's sad Lord Grantham has to miss it.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.312
Are the pigs a good idea, Mr Blake?

04:58.400 --> 05:01.119
It's a good idea fore states like this
to maximise and diversify.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.680
The question is whether or not
Lord Grantham and Lady Mary

05:04.760 --> 05:06.318
fully appreciate what they're taking on.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.597
Oh? You ask as if the answer were "no".

05:09.680 --> 05:11.910
Mr Blake is not under Mary's spell.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.555
- Oh?
- Mrs Crawley.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.674
- Morning.
- Good morning.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.830
- Your water, m'lady.
- Thank you, Carson.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.997
Are you feeling hot? I am.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.878
I've just walked up from the village.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.556
Hmm, I am a bit hot.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.593
But I didn't walk.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.757
I envy you.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.390
Well, I'm not sorry. I can say that.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.029
How do you know you'll get a ship?

05:36.520 --> 05:39.557
Ah, there's always empty cabins.
Sure we'll find something.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.789
Oh, I wish it were me.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.833
Wouldn't you miss Ivy?

05:42.920 --> 05:45.832
Nothing's gonna come of that.
It were a waste of money and effort.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.112
I'm sure something's just around the corner.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.919
Well, I wish it'd get a move on,
or I might do something stupid.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.629
Well, when I get back,
I want to find you happy and healthy

05:54.720 --> 05:56.597
and courting a girl from the village.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.796
Now come on, let's go up,
you can wish me luck.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.830
Oh, darling, I do think your going
to rescue my hopeless brother

06:02.920 --> 06:05.434
is an act of real love,
and I cherish you for it.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.953
That'll keep me warm
as I cross the raging seas.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.389
Good. Now, kiss me.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.871
Lady Grantham says
we can stay till we're done,

06:26.960 --> 06:29.269
but it'll be a few weeks more.
I hope you don't mind.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.713
Not if you make yourselves useful.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.279
We will.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.480
- Try to be strong, my darling.
- I will.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.677
Gregson must be out there somewhere.
I wish you'd let me send a private detective.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.314
There's no point.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.709
His firm's already done all that, to no avail.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.395
Well, if there's anything you want us to do,
Mama will give you whatever you need.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.076
- Goodbye, Mama.
- Goodbye, my dear.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.516
- Try not to let those Yankees drive you mad.
- Hmm.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.158
Mary? Why so preoccupied?

06:58.240 --> 07:01.391
Am I? I'm afraid my mind is on other things.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.355
Anyway, goodbye Papa,
and please try to enjoy yourself.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.271
Good luck with the pigs.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.476
Rose, I leave you in charge of fun.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.152
Oh, mission understood, Captain.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.753
Goodbye, Isobel.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.115
Goodbye, Tom.
Look after all my womenfolk.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.760
Including Isis.
 Especially Isis.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.034
I'll try my best.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.393
Goodbye, Miss Baxter.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.630
I look forward to a full report when I get back.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.756
Why am I going instead of Mr Bates?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.399
I don't know.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.951
No. But that's what
you're going to find out.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.193
Oh, well, that's a relief.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.395
Is it?

07:58.480 --> 08:00.471
Yes I'm, I'm feeling rather ill.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.157
I wanted him away before I keel over.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.470
Oh, I am sorry.
Would you like me to come back with you?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.915
That is the very last thing I would want.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.356
Oh, Carson,
can I have a car please, to take me home?

08:14.440 --> 08:16.590
- Certainly, your ladyship...
- Now.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.633
Thank you for seeing him off.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.030
Evelyn wanted to.
But now we must go, or we'll be late.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.157
Is it just lack of money,
why these places are all failing?

08:26.480 --> 08:29.040
Usually. But why is that?

08:29.720 --> 08:32.597
Because so few of the owners
make the most of what an estate has to offer.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.472
So few think about income.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.754
So few are ready to adjust their way of life.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.034
But you have to understand
what these people are used to.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.078
No. They have to understand
it's time to get used to something different.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.113
They think nothing needs to change.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.749
That God will be upset
if the old order is overturned.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.992
And you don't think He will be?

08:50.080 --> 08:53.390
No. To farm an estate is hard work,
and never more than now.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.199
The owners must face up to that,
or they don't deserve to keep what they have.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.633
You look very intense.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.678
Mr Blake was saying
he finds people like you and me infuriating.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.593
- Er, I think I should point out, Charles...
- We must get going or we’ll be late.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.512
Nice of you to drive me home.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.313
I'm meeting the new pig man.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.752
I do worry about
your life away from the estate.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.309
Is there any?

09:20.840 --> 09:22.239
I've got no time.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.839
What happened to your politics?

09:24.920 --> 09:29.994
They've vanished. Along with that
silly chauffeur chap named Branson.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.909
I don't believe that.

09:33.560 --> 09:38.031
I gather the MP, John Ward, is coming
to speak in Ripon tomorrow, at the Town Hall.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.468
I could get tickets.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.874
I don't think so.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.550
I'm not a fan of the Coalition, as it is.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.834
And he's only here because
Lloyd George thinks an election's coming.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.229
Well, I doubt he has long, poor dear.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.550
But I don't think you're being fair to Mr Ward.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.677
Let's go. What do you say?

09:55.240 --> 09:56.753
I say you better be nice to me,

09:57.720 --> 10:01.235
or I'll tell old Lady Grantham
you called Lloyd George "poor dear."

10:05.840 --> 10:08.195
Would you mind
if I went up to London tomorrow?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.272
Is there news of Mr Gregson?

10:11.040 --> 10:14.476
Well, they've pieced together a little more.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.313
He arrived in Munich
and signed in to his hotel.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.313
Then, that evening, he went out
and never came back.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.877
But it doesn't make any sense.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.958
What was his reason for being there?

10:30.120 --> 10:32.236
To see the castles of King Ludwig.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.357
But darling,
surely if he was attacked or set upon,

10:35.440 --> 10:37.032
they would have found him long ago.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.596
Oh, my dearest one, come here.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.071
I don't ask you not to worry.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.752
Only not quite to give up hope.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.268
Of course you must go up to London.
It would do you good.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.397
Mama, can I ask you something?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.436
You don't think I'm bad, do you?

11:03.840 --> 11:06.434
You can be a bit sharp-tongued
every now and then,

11:07.480 --> 11:09.471
but bad, no.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.510
Sometimes I have bad feelings.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.237
We all have bad feelings.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.270
It's acting on them that makes you bad.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.519
I've had a letter from Alfred.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.511
Oh? What's he got to say for himself?

11:30.600 --> 11:34.878
He's doing well. Some French chap
with a name I can't pronounce

11:34.960 --> 11:36.632
seems to have taken a shine to him.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.234
I don't think we need praise from the French
quite yet.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.389
Does he mention us?

11:40.480 --> 11:43.517
Er, his father's ill so he's coming up to visit,

11:43.600 --> 11:46.478
and he hopes to look in
on his way home to see us all.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.357
- Really?
- Why should you care?

11:48.440 --> 11:51.716
She thinks it would be nice to see him, Daisy.
And so it would be.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.835
Rose? What is it?

11:58.920 --> 12:00.558
I saw Edith on the stairs.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.949
She says she's going up to London tomorrow.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.190
So, I wondered if I could go too.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.794
Rose, in a few months
you'll have been presented,

12:07.880 --> 12:10.189
you'll be out and
everything will be possible.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.238
But you said yourself most girls of my age
would already be presented.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.595
Why do you want to go?

12:16.120 --> 12:19.271
Oh, just to see some old friends
you'd approve of madly.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.316
And Edith's so worried about Mr Gregson.
Maybe I could cheer her up.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.152
Cousin Robert did leave me in charge of fun.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.359
Why is he always so superior?

12:33.440 --> 12:36.398
He's frustrated by all the families
who are giving in.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.358
The axe falls,
and they do nothing to fight back.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.431
But if they can't afford to go on?

12:41.520 --> 12:45.035
But in many cases they could, if they'd take
a new approach to their inheritance,

12:45.120 --> 12:48.635
instead of watching it being carted away
in boxes to be sold.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.029
- He can't think we're doing that.
- Well, no.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.632
But he doubts you'd fight if it came to it.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.195
Oh.

12:56.000 --> 12:56.989
He says you're aloof.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.115
Aloof?

13:00.160 --> 13:02.799
- Well, I hope you stuck up for me.
- Of course I did, but...

13:03.800 --> 13:05.597
- Well...
- Go on.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.516
Charles thinks I'm blind
where you're concerned.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.069
We should go in.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.395
Has anyone told Mr Carson that tea's ready?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.948
There was a telegram earlier.
He took it up to her ladyship.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.634
That means they've got the boat.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.713
What a bonus for Mr Barrow.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.671
A trip to America out of the blue.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.478
Huh! I wouldn't fancy it.

13:37.560 --> 13:41.394
All steaks and ketchup
and hail-fellow-well-met.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.313
- What do you know about it?
- I go to the pictures too, you know.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.872
His lordship has secured passage
on the <i>Cameronla.</i>

13:48.960 --> 13:51.918
They sail tomorrow
and they'll be in New York on Monday.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.718
It's hard to credit, isn't it?

13:54.120 --> 13:55.678
I've robbed you of such a chance.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.470
You've robbed me of nothing
I wouldn't gladly give.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.279
What did Mr Barrow mean
about expecting a report?

14:02.360 --> 14:03.679
Something and nothing.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.354
Are you still awake?

14:14.560 --> 14:17.233
I was on my way to bed
when something told me

14:17.320 --> 14:19.436
to put on my coat
and walk over and check on you.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.589
I hope you don't...

14:26.520 --> 14:28.351
How long have you been like this?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.996
I really don't feel well at all.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.349
Right.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.595
- I'm going now to fetch Dr Clarkson...
- No, it's too late. It's too late.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.238
And I'll be back as soon as I can.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.833
No fuss. Please.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.955
Try and drink.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.839
I'll send your maid up
with some tea and some more water.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.229
How was dinner?

14:48.320 --> 14:51.995
Uphill. I'm so bored
with Mr Blake's cold shoulder.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.513
He hasn't warmed up, then?

14:54.440 --> 14:56.954
According to Mr Napier, he finds me aloof.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.159
I'm not aloof, am I?

14:59.680 --> 15:02.672
Do you want me to answer truthfully
or like a lady's maid?

15:03.440 --> 15:04.839
Let's move on.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.155
I heard you persuaded his lordship
to let Mr Bates stay here,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.638
and I'm so very grateful.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.671
Then you know Mrs Hughes
asked me to intervene,

15:24.200 --> 15:25.519
and told me why.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.833
Yes. So she said.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.358
We still can't find out who he was?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.589
No.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.119
He was a stranger,

15:37.680 --> 15:39.591
I don't know, a robber but...

15:39.920 --> 15:41.069
After...

15:43.240 --> 15:44.798
Afterwards, he just ran off.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.878
But if you described him?

15:49.480 --> 15:54.031
And ought you to see Dr Clarkson,
just to make sure?

15:55.400 --> 15:59.154
M'lady, I don't mind your knowing.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.672
In fact, I'm glad in a way that
there's honesty between us again, but...

16:04.360 --> 16:05.952
But I can't talk about it.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.674
Even to me?

16:08.640 --> 16:09.993
Because I want to help.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.798
You've helped me, God knows, in the past,

16:13.880 --> 16:15.438
and now I want to help you.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.598
I can't talk about it, m'lady.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.149
Not even to you.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.435
That's it. I should be in bed.

16:30.520 --> 16:34.991
Before you go, I'm worried about
Alfred coming back quite so soon.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.799
I thought you liked the lad.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.632
Oh, I do, very much,

16:38.720 --> 16:40.915
but we've had such trouble
with Ivy and Daisy.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.669
We don't want it
stirred up again.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.796
Can we put him off? Just this once?

16:45.880 --> 16:49.031
I don't think I've got his parents' address,
if I ever had it.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.511
Oh, well it's a shame that
we're to end by mithering again.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.669
Oh.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.358
She was a bit ill this morning,
but I thought it was just influenza.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.473
No, this was never flu. It looks like bronchitis.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.310
But there is a lot of flu about
and my nurses are run off their feet.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.558
- I won't be able to spare anyone...
- I can do whatever needs to be done.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.117
But she'll need proper supervision,

17:15.200 --> 17:17.953
otherwise there's a real danger
it could turn into pneumonia.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.634
- We'll have to hire someone tomorrow...
- No. There's no need. I can manage.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.751
- There'll be no let up.
- I know.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.273
What's the treatment?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.155
Inhalants, really.
I'll bring some in the morning.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.396
The main thing is
to keep her temperature down

17:29.480 --> 17:31.550
and to stop pneumonia taking hold.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.108
Morning, Ivy.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.269
Oh, come on.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.512
I only asked what a million men would ask.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.955
And I only answered
what a million women would answer.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.956
He's coming this tea time.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.115
I'll meet him off the train, give him a drink
and send him on his way.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.155
It'll be too late to send him on his way
if he gets here after 5:00!

17:55.240 --> 17:58.312
Then I'll have to bite the bullet
and put him up at the pub.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.671
Won't he find that peculiar?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.354
I don't think so,
I'll tell him we're all very busy.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.715
Say there's flu in the house
and he mustn't miss out on his course.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.869
You're quite a plotter when you
want to be, aren't you?

18:17.440 --> 18:19.874
It's a skill all women must learn.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.838
But are you certain?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.634
- There must be something we can do.
- There really isn't.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.075
I can manage very easily
with help from the servants.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.835
We just have to stop it
turning into pneumonia.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.433
That's the real danger.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.193
It seems rather unfair to saddle you with it all.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.399
- Why should you do it and not us?
- Because I'm a trained nurse.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.029
Why is the food so disgusting, suddenly?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.559
She doesn't know what she's saying.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.992
I wouldn't be too sure.

18:56.920 --> 19:01.311
Everything she puts into my mouth
is absolutely disgusting!

19:01.440 --> 19:02.873
Well, perhaps we'd better get out of your way.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.236
That's all I ask.
I'll ring up if there's any change.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.952
I'm disappointed, Mr Carson. I am.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.871
Oh, you don't want the flu.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.997
You can't risk missing
any more of the course when you started late.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.589
That's true...

19:15.680 --> 19:19.195
I've booked you a room at the pub.
And it's on the house.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.035
You didn't need to do that.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.510
I think I did. You've missed the last train.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.033
You're very kind, Mr Carson.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.590
We'll have a drink first.
You and me, man to man,

19:29.680 --> 19:31.716
and then I'll leave you to it.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.353
Why did Alfred change his plans?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.829
Well Mrs Hughes won't know, will she?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.433
That's rather disappointing.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.476
What do you mean?
What have you got to be disappointed about?

19:43.440 --> 19:46.000
- I thought it'd be nice to see him.
- I don't know why.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.275
- Why not?
- I'll tell you.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.033
Because you made his life a misery
with your unkindness

19:51.280 --> 19:52.952
and your cold and vicious heart.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.838
Steady on, Daisy.
I don't think Ivy's quite deserved this.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.319
- Well, we know one thing.
- You were right to put him off.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.759
Well, tonight there can be no let up.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.116
You mustn't sleep,
you must not let her temperature get higher.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.393
I want another nurse. I insist!

20:08.480 --> 20:10.994
This, this one talks too much.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.636
She's like a drunken vicar!

20:16.120 --> 20:19.795
The family took me in and kept me close
when my link with them had gone.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.749
- I owe them a great deal.
- Lf you insist.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.759
I'll look in later. Ring at the slightest change.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.675
Well, the pigs have arrived.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.711
Oh, I'd have come, if I'd known.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.110
I looked for you.
They said you'd gone to your grandmother’s.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.758
But it all went off smoothly.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.353
We can walk down and see them tomorrow.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.352
Tom, did you get the message about
the tickets for the talk in Ripon?

20:42.440 --> 20:43.793
I did. Why can't she come?

20:43.920 --> 20:46.639
Because Mama is ill and Isobel is nursing her.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.156
- What's the thing in Ripon?
- A Liberal MP is speaking.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.559
I don't think I'll bother now.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.837
Why? Just because we're not political,
you mustn't be put off.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.114
So you won't come with me, then?

20:55.440 --> 20:56.998
I'd rather go to the stake.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.237
But what sort of errands?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.038
Oh, you know. This and that.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.636
Seeing friends, buying clothes, errands.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.836
I hope Sir John Bullock
isn't one of your "errands".

21:07.920 --> 21:09.069
He is not.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.592
Oh, let her go, Aunt Rosamund.

21:11.880 --> 21:12.869
All right.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.072
But you'll be back in time for dinner.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.355
I'm sure I will. You're a darling.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.509
Taxi!

21:19.000 --> 21:20.797
"I'm sure I will." What does that mean?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.276
I don't know why Mama let her come.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.831
Darling, please tell me what's the matter.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.798
You seem so <i>preoccupée</i> lately.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.918
What do you mean,
you'll be out tomorrow night?

21:34.760 --> 21:37.877
I'll be away, but I don't want Mama to know.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.313
It's not very difficult.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.674
It is difficult for me.

21:41.240 --> 21:45.119
To be put in a position of disloyal falsehood
where your parents are concerned.

21:45.480 --> 21:49.109
You said yourself I'm a grown woman
and you're not a spy.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.640
The last time you did this
you were with your Mr Gregson, weren't you?

21:54.760 --> 21:56.034
So it can't be a repetition.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.559
Oh, my dear.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.874
My dear...

22:26.760 --> 22:28.398
I'm so pleased to see you.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.912
I keep thinking you'll forget about me.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.069
Rose!

22:33.440 --> 22:34.634
I won't forget you.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.035
Ever.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.918
- But...
- But what?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.238
Rose, I like you very much,
I want you to know.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.355
But?

22:42.440 --> 22:44.112
But what can we hope to come out of all this?

22:45.600 --> 22:48.273
Can't we just be in the moment?

22:48.360 --> 22:51.955
I don't know many men like you,
and you don't know many girls like me.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.029
Ain't that the truth?

22:53.120 --> 22:55.111
Oh, then let's enjoy it.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.553
You know what the French say?

22:57.640 --> 22:59.198
<i>Vive la différence!</i>

23:00.400 --> 23:02.595
And do you think Lord Grantham
will enjoy the <i>différence?</i>

23:03.440 --> 23:04.475
Or Lady Mary?

23:04.960 --> 23:06.359
You're not scared of them, are you?

23:07.200 --> 23:08.633
- No.
- Good.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.756
Then you'll take me to the club tonight.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.395
But first, kiss me.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.674
Or don't you want to?

23:19.120 --> 23:20.314
Oh, I want to.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.474
Don't you worry about that.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.234
I'm not even sure
which frightens me most,

23:37.320 --> 23:40.869
what may have happened to Michael
or... the baby.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.109
And...

23:43.920 --> 23:45.558
What do you propose to do?

23:48.400 --> 23:49.389
It's...

23:50.640 --> 23:52.153
...hard to say the words, but...

23:54.640 --> 23:56.392
...I've decided to get rid of it.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.198
How terrible it is to hear that.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.109
Please don't pretend
you won't be relieved when I do.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.553
You're not being fair.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.390
I will support you whatever you decide.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.755
Just as Cora will and Robert.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.708
That sounds like a speech
from <i>The Second Mrs Tanqueray.</i>

24:13.040 --> 24:15.873
- But you don't mean a word of it.
- I do.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.309
So I'd be welcome
in your drawing room, would I?

24:19.840 --> 24:22.149
Have you met my niece
and her charming bastard?

24:22.240 --> 24:24.196
I refuse to be shocked!

24:27.040 --> 24:30.510
But what will you say when Mr Gregson
walks through the door,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.716
with a full explanation for his silence?

24:34.360 --> 24:35.475
Nothing.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.078
I pray he is alive,

24:39.040 --> 24:40.758
but, if he is, I won't say a thing.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.034
And you will marry him?

24:42.800 --> 24:44.438
If he still wants me to.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.594
So your whole life will be based on a lie.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.388
Have you thought about that?

24:51.320 --> 24:54.835
I am killing the wanted child of a man
I'm in love with

24:54.920 --> 24:56.876
and you ask me if I've thought about it?

25:02.560 --> 25:06.997
I assume you'll be away for the night
because you have booked into some...

25:10.040 --> 25:13.749
Some place where they will do this.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.639
How did you find it?

25:18.560 --> 25:21.677
There was a magazine
in the ladies' waiting room at King's Cross.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.479
- You do realise it is quite illegal?
- Of course.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.754
And dangerous!

25:27.040 --> 25:29.349
What will I say to your parents
if it goes wrong?

25:30.680 --> 25:31.999
You'll think of something.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.470
Very well. If you've made up your mind,

25:41.800 --> 25:43.199
I shall come with you.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.873
Where's Evelyn?

25:49.960 --> 25:51.678
Dining with friends of his parents.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.193
He telephoned earlier.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.034
And Tom's gone off to a political meeting,
so I'm afraid it's just us.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.874
Don't be afraid.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.111
But we are afraid. How can two brainless
dullards like us

26:02.200 --> 26:03.872
ever hope to entertain Mr Blake?

26:03.960 --> 26:06.520
Mary? That sounded a little rude.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.160
I can take it. Did the pigs arrive?

26:09.240 --> 26:13.392
Absolutely. Although un-witnessed by me.
I'll go with Tom tomorrow.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.429
Well, I'm curious to see them
and I'll be out all day.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.875
Why don't we walk down after dinner?
Lady Grantham?

26:19.400 --> 26:21.630
You two go. I'll take it on trust.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.395
Well, it's a nice evening. What about it?

26:25.000 --> 26:30.154
Well, it's quite a long walk, but I don't mind,
if you really want to.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.349
Is this seat taken?

26:35.440 --> 26:36.998
Ah, I was keeping it for a friend.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.070
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
I'm John Ward,

26:45.280 --> 26:47.589
and in a while I will ask for questions,

26:47.680 --> 26:51.434
so please remember what made you indignant
when you last read a newspaper.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.429
Are you trying to attract my attention
ahead of the rest, madam?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.798
I just wanted him to take this chair.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.957
- Do you know this gentleman?
- No.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.473
You just wanted to sit next to him?

27:05.280 --> 27:07.589
Er no, it was because he asked.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.352
He asked to sit next to you?

27:09.440 --> 27:12.796
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been made
privy to a very romantic story.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.871
Why don't I sit down?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.918
Of course the question
uppermost in all of your minds is,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.913
why the split between Mr Asquith
and Mr Lloyd George?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.673
Because a divided party spells
electoral defeat.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.639
Well, can I say this,

27:28.040 --> 27:29.996
it doesn't have to.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.275
- He's wrong there.
- Since 1910...

27:32.360 --> 27:34.316
- But you support them?
- Not really.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.432
I'm a Socialist. Or I was.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.594
What happened to your friend?

27:40.440 --> 27:41.475
I don't know.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.310
It just seemed silly to keep the chair empty.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.115
I'm glad.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.474
- Because they believed in the courts.
- Shh!

27:49.560 --> 27:52.393
Of course, history teaches us
that in 1910...

27:52.960 --> 27:54.951
The idea is to learn from these,

27:55.040 --> 27:57.235
then, if it's going well, expand.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.359
And you have a good pig man?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.237
He comes highly recommended.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.673
Well, that's important because...

28:05.280 --> 28:06.395
What is it?

28:08.600 --> 28:10.670
- What is it? What's happening?
- This one's almost dead.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.314
- What? Why?
- It looks dehydrated.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.834
- It's had no water.
- Isn't there a water trough?

28:17.120 --> 28:18.394
They've kicked it over.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.072
- How could this have happened?
- All too easily.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.472
Should I fetch the pig man?
I could run back to the house?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.797
- Lf only we'd brought a car!
- There's no time for any of that.

28:26.880 --> 28:27.995
Where's the nearest clean water?

28:28.080 --> 28:31.709
There's a water pipe, in the barn.
Should we drive the animals to it?

28:31.800 --> 28:32.949
That would kill them.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.793
When they've had no water for this long,
you must give it to them gradually.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.435
Wait a moment.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.912
I'm sorry about that earlier.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.870
You can't blame him
for having a bit of fun.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.631
There won't be much fun for them
after the election.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.517
What do you care? If you're a Socialist?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.509
I'm not sure what I am,

28:57.920 --> 28:59.831
except a man in search of a better world.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.948
Why did you leave Ireland?

29:02.720 --> 29:04.199
Sometimes I ask myself that.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.998
- Will you go back?
- No.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.469
Why not?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.911
It's a long story. I'd better go.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.316
Thanks for the seat, though. Good night.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.799
Does no one care whether I live or die?

29:23.160 --> 29:24.149
There, there.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.589
Oh, God.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.193
This will make you feel better.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.595
Hmm?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.594
Compared to what?

29:57.280 --> 29:58.395
I'm fine.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.235
I'm fine!

30:02.480 --> 30:03.549
Suit yourself.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.475
I'm off.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.109
Oh...

30:25.200 --> 30:28.556
Well done,
for containing the Downton heartbreaker.

30:28.840 --> 30:32.515
Everyone's gone to bed,
but Lady Mary's still out with Mr Blake.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.593
What should I do about locking up?

30:34.680 --> 30:36.272
I wonder what's taking the time.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.715
Nothing.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.754
Well, nothing like that.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.713
I should leave the front door open
with the key in the lock,

30:43.800 --> 30:44.949
and they can turn it when they come in.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.917
You're not frightened of burglars?

30:47.640 --> 30:50.313
Mr Carson, this is England.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.993
Are they going to be all right?

31:03.760 --> 31:07.548
I think so. I'll watch them for another hour
and give them one more drink.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.950
- But you should go.
- I'm not going. They're my pigs.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.472
Here, take my coat. At least it's dry.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.559
- Not quite the evening we planned.
- Oh.

31:34.680 --> 31:35.999
What do I look like?

31:37.040 --> 31:38.837
You belong in <i>Country Life.</i>

31:39.920 --> 31:43.993
"Lady Mary Crawley, seen here to advantage
relaxing at the family seat in Yorkshire."

31:44.920 --> 31:45.955
Ha, ha.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.035
Where have you been?

32:18.480 --> 32:20.516
Having such a dreamy time.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.233
Is she furious? That I missed dinner?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.195
Why can't you just fit in for once?

32:27.280 --> 32:28.474
Shall I go and make my peace?

32:28.960 --> 32:30.393
Good night, Rose.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.399
Who'd have thought it?

32:55.920 --> 32:58.036
I can scramble eggs, but that's about it.

33:02.240 --> 33:05.073
I suspect Carson had plans for this,
but too bad.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.279
I don't deserve such attention.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.909
You certainly do.
You've completely saved our bacon. Literally.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.598
So, you're a practical farmer,
as well as a theoretician.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.398
I'm not sure I was expecting that.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.434
I didn't expect to see you as a cook
and a water carrier.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.069
A night of discovery.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.949
Good discoveries.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.068
For me, anyway.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.789
I love how they've all gone to bed,
without the slightest concern about us.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.074
What do they think we were doing?

33:42.760 --> 33:44.079
We went for a walk and vanished.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.239
Who knows what they thought?

33:51.280 --> 33:54.192
- I'm ever so sorry, m'lady.
- Please don't apologise.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.189
- Ivy, m'lady.
- Ivy.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.230
Well if you're getting up,
it's time for us to go to bed.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.630
Would you please tell Anna
I'll ring when I'm awake?

34:10.880 --> 34:12.029
Good night.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.995
Good night.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.389
Thank you.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.469
It's right. This is it.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.559
It doesn't look very right.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.150
It should say Thompson on the bell.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.708
Well, here goes.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.753
If you'll wait,
the doctor will be with you very soon.

34:55.239 --> 34:56.878
As long as he is a doctor.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.114
- You don't have to stay.
- Of course I do.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.758
Would you like a glass of water?

35:12.400 --> 35:13.469
No, thank you.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.356
It's not that I don't love him, you know.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.034
I do love him,

35:22.720 --> 35:24.551
and I would have loved his baby.

35:27.680 --> 35:31.912
But I just can't see over the top of this.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.309
No.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.712
I don't want to be an outcast.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.755
I don't want to be some funny woman
living in Maida Vale

35:42.840 --> 35:44.239
that people never talk about.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.469
Sybil might have brought it off, but not me.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.028
Oh, no, I see that.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.556
But you think I'm terribly selfish.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.358
Please don't put words into my mouth.

35:57.640 --> 35:58.993
I don't know what I think,

36:00.080 --> 36:01.991
except that I wish it were over.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.717
I can't go back to the nursery.

36:08.360 --> 36:12.239
Not with Mary's son
and Sybil's daughter waiting there.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.753
I can't do that.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.478
I won't be able to do that.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.393
Not for a while.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.518
Not forever, I don't think.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.793
- The doctor's just...
- I'm afraid this was a mistake.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.950
- There's no reason to...
- I'm terribly sorry to waste your time,

36:56.040 --> 36:57.871
but this is a mistake.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.159
It seems it was a mistake.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.789
Why? But why has everything changed?
I've arranged things for tonight!

37:10.880 --> 37:12.393
Then un-arrange them.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.550
- Why should I?
- Because I'm telling you to.

37:14.680 --> 37:15.999
Just do it, dear.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.519
Are you going to tell Cora?

37:24.520 --> 37:26.829
I suppose I must do, at some stage.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.559
If you want me to be there, let me know.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.437
I'm certain there's a way forward.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.913
Certain of it.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.592
Well, the decision's been made now.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.956
- You've heard about our adventures.
- I'm very impressed.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.518
- There you are!
- I'm afraid I slept rather late.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.989
Have you remembered Tony Gillingham's
coming tonight?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.039
What? Why?

37:52.120 --> 37:53.519
He's driving up to fish the Spey.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.034
He asked Papa if he could stay the night.
I'm sure I told you.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.479
- Did he used to be Tony Foyle?
- That's right. Why?

37:59.560 --> 38:01.278
We served together in the war.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.838
On board the <i>Iron Duke</i> with Jellicoe.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.395
- Were you at Jutland?
- We were.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.313
Well, you'll see him again tonight.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.512
To be honest,
I telephoned and I tried to put him off

38:11.600 --> 38:13.192
but he didn't seem to want to be put off.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.350
Don't worry. It's perfectly fine.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.189
I gather you were the heroine
of the pig drama.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.875
So I'm not aloof now?

38:22.960 --> 38:24.871
Not a bit.
Mucking in with the best of them.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.555
Only trouble for me is that...
I'm afraid it's increased the competition.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.158
Hello, Daisy. Hello, lvy.

38:41.800 --> 38:42.915
We thought you weren't coming.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.718
Mr Carson warned me about the flu.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.389
What flu?

38:47.480 --> 38:51.758
Er, Mrs Patmore and I both think
we're coming down with the flu, don't we?

38:52.120 --> 38:56.830
We do, indeed. And we're wanting to
spare Alfred from it if we could.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.319
You look well enough to me.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.871
Looks can be deceptive.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.234
We're so pleased to see you.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.035
Aren't we? Daisy? Jimmy?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.035
We've missed you.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.749
I don't know about that.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.359
- Have you really missed me, Ivy?
- Oh, I have.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.876
The place isn't the same without you,
is it, Daisy?

39:19.440 --> 39:21.032
If I thought you meant that,
I'm not sure I could go.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.596
Which makes it all the sadder
that you have to.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.114
You're right. I can't stay long.
I've got to get back to London.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.910
I'm sorry now.
I should have just come last night.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.511
Mr Carson was being over careful.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.432
Yes, I'm sure that's what it was.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.435
Alfred? What are you doing here?

39:37.520 --> 39:41.115
He thought he'd look in,
before he catches the train.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.952
We've warned him about our flu!

39:43.560 --> 39:44.754
Oh...

39:46.560 --> 39:50.951
So, we've got all the trouble
and a bill to pay at the pub, too.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.838
Oh, go on with you. I'm sure you don't
grudge him a decent dinner.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.150
But I do grudge him
the tears and the heartbreak

39:56.240 --> 39:58.674
that'll flavour my puddings
for weeks to come.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.992
Well, you've given me
summat to think about, Ivy. And I will.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.912
That's such good news!
If you really are hungry.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.594
Well, I'm not ravenous,

40:15.320 --> 40:18.118
but I wouldn't mind a piece of toast.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.033
- I'll ask straight away.
- Oh, can't you ring...

40:22.000 --> 40:23.638
Well, really...

40:25.120 --> 40:26.792
Dr Clarkson, when you go,

40:27.160 --> 40:29.799
will you please take that
mad woman with you?

40:31.760 --> 40:34.638
That mad woman
has refused to leave your side

40:34.720 --> 40:36.950
for the last two days and two nights.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.998
She has not slept nor eaten
since you were taken ill.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.590
But there were, there were nurses here?

40:44.120 --> 40:47.317
No, I remember a nurse wiping my brow.

40:47.720 --> 40:49.756
She was that nurse, Lady Grantham.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.271
But what about Cora and Mary?

40:54.040 --> 40:57.828
They offered, but Mrs Crawley felt
she had more knowledge than they.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.797
Yes, that has a ring of truth.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.512
I've asked them to bring up
some toast and tea.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.354
Now that Lady Grantham is a little better,
it's time you had a break.

41:08.440 --> 41:12.353
I might go home and have a bath.
Shall I come back later?

41:15.280 --> 41:18.477
Oh, oh yes, dear. That would be very kind.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.834
Good.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.310
I can stay all evening.
Perhaps we can play cards.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.998
You will be rewarded in Heaven.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.679
The sooner the better.

41:38.560 --> 41:39.788
I think this is the right place.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.994
Oh, well, if it isn't Mr Gillingham!

41:44.080 --> 41:45.593
Welcome back! Pull up a chair, sit down.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.069
Er, I suppose you've come to
shake us up again.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.390
Will there be any more
Racing Demon this time, Mr Gillingham?

41:50.480 --> 41:53.870
Depends if you're up to it.
But I expect you've all got things to do.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.393
Miss Baxter, I wondered if you could...

41:58.880 --> 42:00.029
If I could what?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.190
If you could let me have some white thread.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.556
- I seem to have run out.
- Of course.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.159
Oh, go on then, Gillingham.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.276
What've you been up to
since we saw you last?

42:13.360 --> 42:15.555
Having fun and games
at other people's expense?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.719
I'd better not tell you too much.
I don't want to shock the ladies.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.159
I hope you don't mind
my turning up again.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.796
It's the perfect stopping point
between London and Inverness.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.633
I don't mind at all. How are you?

42:34.360 --> 42:35.475
Well, missing you, mainly.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.911
Sounds to me as if the needle's got stuck.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.115
How's Mabel?

42:45.200 --> 42:46.519
I gather Charles Blake's here.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.671
Of course, you served together.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.152
We don't really know him,
but he and Evelyn Napier

42:52.240 --> 42:54.356
are writing a report for the government.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.158
He'll be up here for a few weeks.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.635
Lucky devil.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.798
Well, don't get to like him better than me.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.199
No chance of that.

43:02.360 --> 43:06.717
They're out all day, and even in the evenings
we've hardly spoken until yesterday.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.153
What happened yesterday?

43:08.760 --> 43:12.435
Some pigs arrived and of course,
as usual, Mr Blake was...

43:14.000 --> 43:15.672
Anyway, what does it matter?

43:20.520 --> 43:23.398
Hello, Charles. Good to see you again.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.994
Well, this is nice.
What task brings you to Yorkshire?

43:26.080 --> 43:27.672
Well, nothing as meaningful as yours.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.478
Uh, what sort of a report are you working on?

43:29.560 --> 43:32.950
Oh, the current health of the landed estate.
My usual stamping ground.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.511
So, did you get everything done?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.309
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.319
By the time we got back,
we looked as if we'd been wrestling in mud.

43:44.160 --> 43:45.752
- And had you?
- No.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.229
But then it's always nice to leave
something for another time.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.512
So what are the chances for Downton?

43:58.760 --> 44:00.671
I'd say they look bright.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.558
At least Lady Mary and the family
mean to give it everything they've got.

44:03.840 --> 44:08.675
If Mary means to give it everything she's got,
then that is a very considerable gift.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.113
I couldn't agree more.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.474
Dinner, everyone.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.239
They said you were in here.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.115
What can I do for you, Mrs Hughes?

44:25.200 --> 44:27.998
Nothing! You can do nothing for me.

44:28.080 --> 44:31.277
Because I know who you are
and I know what you've done.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.670
And while you're here, if you value your life,

44:36.480 --> 44:38.948
I should stop playing the joker
and keep to the shadows.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.276
I'm afraid we were a bit drunk that night,
Anna and I.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.628
So you're right, we were both to blame.

44:53.880 --> 44:56.235
No, Mr Green.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.834
You were to blame and only you.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.628
Does Mr Bates know?

45:04.360 --> 45:05.679
Not that it was you.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.835
Thank you.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.517
Don't you dare thank me!

45:11.640 --> 45:14.154
I've not kept silent for your sake.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.311
I think it's gin.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.516
Oh. So it is.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.597
I'd forgotten what a good game this is.

45:31.680 --> 45:34.433
- Yes. I'd forgotten.
- How long does it go on for?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.956
- Oh, ages!
- Oh, goody, goody.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.437
Oh, dear. Alfred's relit the taper.

45:46.520 --> 45:49.193
Well, to be young
is to have your heart broken,

45:49.280 --> 45:52.238
in the kitchens at Downton,
like everywhere else.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.709
I've spent half the day
brushing the mud out of his dinner jacket.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.675
Why can't he have his own valet,
instead of making work for me?

46:00.560 --> 46:01.675
Anna?

46:04.080 --> 46:06.799
Sorry. Yes. What were you saying?

46:07.320 --> 46:10.039
Mr Blake's evening shoes
were quite a challenge, I can tell you.

46:10.120 --> 46:13.954
I wasn't working here then.
It's a pity 'cause I admire Nellie Melba.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.793
- I'd have loved to hear her sing.
- You must be joking.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.909
Why? I thought she had a beautiful voice.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.152
Beautiful? Screaming and screeching,
as if her finger was caught in a door?

46:24.240 --> 46:26.071
I swear, I couldn't take it
for one more moment.

46:26.680 --> 46:27.795
So what did you do?

46:28.320 --> 46:30.914
Well, I came down here
for a bit of peace and quiet, that's what.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.636
Oh, is that
more of the cauliflower cheese?

46:34.305 --> 46:40.218
