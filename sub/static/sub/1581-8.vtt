to the empire.

14:40.683 --> 14:42.249
We'll need to
smuggle him off lothal.

14:42.251 --> 14:44.718
Gotta smuggle him
out of town first.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.288
You know
the only reason the imperials
haven't caught him yet...

14:47.290 --> 14:50.124
Is because their forces
were occupied
with empire day.

14:50.126 --> 14:52.226
But the day's
almost done.

14:52.994 --> 14:54.762
[ sabine, ezra groan ]

14:56.698 --> 14:58.699
Tear open every rathole
in the sector.

14:58.701 --> 15:00.234
Find that rodian.

15:08.376 --> 15:11.145
[ groans ]
I miss zeb.

15:12.647 --> 15:13.714
What?

15:14.983 --> 15:17.618
Come on, tseebo.
Move it.

15:17.620 --> 15:21.322
[ speaking huttese ]
shh!

15:41.677 --> 15:43.644
Acknowledged.
We're ready.

15:43.646 --> 15:45.012
Positions!

15:55.023 --> 15:58.259
That's far enough,
rebel scum.

16:00.061 --> 16:03.430
I have no plans
on stopping.
That's good to know!

16:08.670 --> 16:09.870
Stop!

16:11.306 --> 16:12.239
Punch it!

16:14.776 --> 16:16.143
Fire!

16:33.828 --> 16:35.229
Stop, I said!

16:35.231 --> 16:37.231
I-I said stop!

This is agent kallus, isb-021,

<i>The rebels</i>
<i>are through the main gate</i>
<i>and headed south.</i>

17:05.127 --> 17:06.859
Their ship
will be waiting.

17:06.862 --> 17:09.396
Slow them down.
We're on our way.

17:24.279 --> 17:27.214

Spectre-5 to <i> ghost.</i>
We're coming in hot.

18:23.539 --> 18:26.540
Can see that.
You got company upstairs.

18:26.542 --> 18:29.209
Take them down!

18:34.282 --> 18:37.117
Shields holding,
but I need that transport
taken out.

<i>Have to be a scoop job.</i>
<i>Sensors reading multiple ties</i>
<i>incoming.</i>

19:11.053 --> 19:15.589
Tie fighters will begin

You ready?
Yeah.
Autopilot's engaged.

Kallus to inquisitor.
The rodian tseebo is confirmed
aboard the rebel vessel.

20:13.915 --> 20:17.418
Acknowledged.
Ties, assume attack formation.
Fire at will.

20:20.188 --> 20:23.023
I need my gunners.
Shields won't hold long
under this barrage.

He says he knows what happened
to your parents.
