00:08.000 --> 00:09.644
When you are working on a case

00:09.667 --> 00:11.102
that you think
is a wrongful conviction,

00:11.125 --> 00:12.769
you're only on one side.

00:12.792 --> 00:14.709
And that side
is getting to the truth.

00:16.417 --> 00:20.686
18-year-old Hae Min Lee
disappeared on January 13.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.977
Police found
her half-buried body.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.458
She had been strangled.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.959
The suspect is Adnan Masud Syed.

00:30.750 --> 00:31.750
I've been saying to Adnan,

00:32.083 --> 00:33.394
"We should go to media.
We should go to journalists.

00:33.417 --> 00:34.750
'Cause they can do things
we can't do."

00:37.917 --> 00:41.018
Adnan Syed's story
has captivated millions

00:41.041 --> 00:43.291
since the launch of
the podcast Serial.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.852
It's our
responsibility as investigators

00:45.875 --> 00:47.875
to consider other suspects.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.936
Now, Adnan
Syed heads back to court

00:51.959 --> 00:54.792
as questions about his case
continue to surface.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.394
This is a piece of evidence

00:58.417 --> 01:00.750
that nobody even realized
existed for all these years.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.602
I might've been the last person
to see him.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.102
I'm telling you,
that's what happened.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.458
I wish I never would've talked
to y'all in the first place.

01:10.542 --> 01:13.625
This is perhaps the critical
piece to the state's case.

01:17.709 --> 01:20.125
Now, I know there are
things that don't look good for me.

The Pacers are gonna win it
next year.

03:47.792 --> 03:48.852

03:48.875 --> 03:50.227

04:05.208 --> 04:06.769
I ain't that kind of white.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.519
You guys want to go back on?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.477
Fuck your mama, Lenny!

04:16.834 --> 04:18.267
I'll send Bower down there.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.644
Ooh, I'm scared now!

04:21.666 --> 04:22.977
All good.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.102
All right, Louis,
you're good to go.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.977
Hey, CO, man, come open up
my door.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.811

05:56.834 --> 05:59.227
Yeah, we must have done
something wrong... it's long.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.852
Too goddamn long, bro.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.477
I've been reading, you know,
keeping myself cool.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.977
Yeah, that's what's up.
That's what's up.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.560

He was talking shit, man.

18:10.417 --> 18:11.560
Then next time,
turn the other cheek.

18:11.583 --> 18:12.977
That ain't how it works.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.394
Well, I guess you're fucked
now, aren't you?

18:14.417 --> 18:15.977
Get your fucking hands
off me, man.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.268
You don't be pulling on me
and shit like that,

18:17.291 --> 18:18.769
bending my motherfucking
hand up.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.602
Punk motherfucker.
You're gonna fucking go.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.769
Oh, okay.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.936
What you gonna do about it?
Go get your brothers, huh?

18:37.500 --> 18:39.166
Row five.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.227
Get dressed.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.333
Investigator Danvers
wants to see ya.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.185
I thought we were too old
for this shit.

19:04.208 --> 19:05.811
Yeah, you and me both.

19:05.834 --> 19:08.852
Now I got to call you in over
this latest round of bullshit

19:08.875 --> 19:11.018
that we both know is beneath
our pay grade.

19:11.041 --> 19:12.977
Uh, you and me got different
pay grades.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.852
What's going down with you
and the Uniteds?

19:18.875 --> 19:20.936
No idea.
You're lying.

19:20.959 --> 19:24.394
Come on, Officer Meadows
got you on camera

19:24.417 --> 19:27.727
fighting with that young guy
probably from the Uniteds.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.894
Officer Meadows?

19:29.917 --> 19:31.310
What?
Meadows.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.435
Yeah, yeah, what's going on
with you all?

19:33.458 --> 19:35.352
Like I told you, Mike,
I got no idea.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.060
Ah, you're bullshitting me.

19:37.083 --> 19:41.560
Hey, um, the kid came up
to me looking for money.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.185
Why?

19:43.208 --> 19:44.519
Why?

19:44.542 --> 19:46.310
Y'all had us on lockdown
for three fucking months.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.602
Ain't nobody got no cash.
Why you think?

19:48.625 --> 19:49.811
Did you know the kid?
Who?

19:49.834 --> 19:51.060
Which kid?

19:51.083 --> 19:52.936
Stop playing games,
the Beech kid.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.352
Beech?

19:54.375 --> 19:56.686
Dante Beecher, that's the kid
you fought.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.268
Beech? What the fuck kind
of name is Beech?

19:58.291 --> 20:00.227
I don't know.
Beecher, it's his fucking name.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.602
What do I...

20:01.625 --> 20:03.352
Is this the first time
that you had contact with him?

20:03.375 --> 20:05.227
With who?
Oh.

20:05.250 --> 20:08.602
Hey, look, I've never seen
the kid before.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.936
I got no reason to mess
with him, and what,

20:10.959 --> 20:14.686
you think I want to spend
my last five weeks in the SHU?

20:14.709 --> 20:16.727
Did he have any affiliations
coming in?

20:16.750 --> 20:18.936
Who, Dante Beecher?

20:18.959 --> 20:21.625
Yes.
The fuck would I know?

20:22.500 --> 20:25.769
I'm just saying,
Terry must want him awful bad

20:25.792 --> 20:27.143
if he's willing to send him
after you.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.644
Yeah, Terry's a fucking dumb-ass

20:29.667 --> 20:31.435
sending anybody after me.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.477
Uh, he's probably desperate...

20:34.500 --> 20:37.500
because of what happened
up at Indiana State.

20:40.166 --> 20:41.435
What happened?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.769
The Uniteds put a hit on Warren.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.458
Guy died.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.060
Head of the Syndicate?

20:48.083 --> 20:51.417
Yeah, and you know things
could get real bad real fast...

20:53.000 --> 20:55.811
Which is why I need you
to tell me what you hear.

20:55.834 --> 20:56.977
Fuck out of here.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.977
Hmm.
Come on, Louis.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.686
Fake-ass sugar.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.560
Never been a snitch,
not about to start.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.644
I've never hesitated to throw
you in the hole,

21:05.667 --> 21:06.977
and I'm not about to now.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.102
I got a bad heart.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.769
I got fucking prostate cancer,

21:09.792 --> 21:12.185
but I still show up at this
shit hole each and every day.

21:12.208 --> 21:14.102
At least you got a choice.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.644
They don't pay me enough
for choice.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.560
Yeah, well, maybe they should
give you a raise

21:17.583 --> 21:19.477
every time you throw somebody
in the hole.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.310
You know, you must have
thrown me in there

21:21.333 --> 21:22.686
at least 15 times.

21:22.709 --> 21:25.477
You deserved every single
one of 'em.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.644
Nah, I deserved maybe four.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.185
You were running
the entire prison.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.686
Nah, I was helping out Moses,

21:34.709 --> 21:36.519
but I was never really running
the whole show.

21:36.542 --> 21:37.894
That's a bold-faced lie.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.894
After Moses passed,
it was all you,

21:39.917 --> 21:40.852
and we both know that.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.435
Ah, you embellishing.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.143
What are you talking... we knew
that you were bringing in

21:44.166 --> 21:47.686
eight to ten ounces of powder
every month, every month.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.268
Fuck out of here.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.560
What are you talking about...
"Get the fuck out of here"?

21:51.583 --> 21:54.227
I was the one who caught
that chick Sleepy,

21:54.250 --> 21:55.852
and she told me the whole thing.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.143
She was stuffing it so far
up there, you couldn't find it

21:59.166 --> 22:01.519
with waterproof night-vision
goggles.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.686
Talk about putting people
in the hole.

22:07.709 --> 22:10.018
Holy shit, man.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.560
She a pretty girl, though.
Yeah, yeah.

22:16.583 --> 22:21.208
Hey, I used to get with her
in the infirmary broom closet.

22:22.875 --> 22:26.394
Yeah, I-I'm gonna pretend
that I didn't just hear that.

22:26.417 --> 22:28.060
Hear what?
I didn't say shit.

22:31.750 --> 22:35.102
Point is, if Terry's up
against the wall,

22:35.125 --> 22:37.227
then he's gonna kick back.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.977
There's no doubt about that.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.060
And I need to know
what's coming, and...

22:42.083 --> 22:44.519
you're probably gonna have
that information before me.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.394
Listen, everyone knows

22:47.417 --> 22:50.083
you didn't want Terry
to take over from you.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.894
So maybe you'll help me out.

22:54.917 --> 22:57.602
I'm not saying you want
the Syndicate to win.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.143
I'm just saying that...

23:00.166 --> 23:04.394
you might enjoy
seeing Terry stumble.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.602
If I did...

23:06.625 --> 23:08.583
it wouldn't be that way.

23:13.709 --> 23:16.268
All right, then.
That's it? We're through?

23:16.291 --> 23:17.625
For now.

23:22.542 --> 23:23.959
Leave 'em.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.268
I ain't did shit.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.458
This shit crazy, man.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.477
Hey, young blood.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.542
Run up on me again,
I'm gonna stretch you.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.435
Hey, big dog, let me talk
to you for a minute.

23:49.458 --> 23:51.394
What's up?
What's the problem, Louis?

23:51.417 --> 23:52.936
Terry sent this fresh fish
after me

23:52.959 --> 23:54.143
talking about paying rent.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.352
Not all at all, man.

23:55.375 --> 23:56.686
That was Spider.
That wasn't Terry.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.143
Bullshit, Macon,
it's disrespectful.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.185
Look, we got a situation
on our hands.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.394
I don't give a fuck.
You don't send nobody after me.

24:02.417 --> 24:03.977
I don't care what you
give a fuck about, Louis.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.102
Your ass is going home
in a few weeks anyway.

24:06.125 --> 24:07.602
So we doing what we need to do.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.102
Now, you know Terry
respects you.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.560
Then why he sending people
after me?

24:10.583 --> 24:11.936
'Cause we gearing the fuck up.

24:11.959 --> 24:14.060
And even if he did call it...

24:14.083 --> 24:15.686
You heard what happened
in the city.

24:15.709 --> 24:16.977
That don't affect me, Macon.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.060
Everything affects everything.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.435
Now, your ass either with us
or against us.

24:21.458 --> 24:24.018
And if this about you still...

24:24.041 --> 24:25.644
Now, if this about you still
being mad

24:25.667 --> 24:27.268
about not getting a piece
of the tray, now, you know...

24:27.291 --> 24:28.686
It ain't about that, Macon.

24:28.709 --> 24:30.185
So then back the fuck up,

24:30.208 --> 24:32.185
and let's do what the fuck
we need to do, then.

24:32.208 --> 24:33.644
You ain't running shit no more.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.852
Hey, let me tell you
something... you ain't either.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.352
Huh?

24:37.375 --> 24:39.519
Anything else you need to say?

24:39.542 --> 24:41.310
Don't be sending
motherfuckers after me.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.602
Yeah, what the fuck else?

24:43.625 --> 24:46.018
Better give a brother
some space, motherfucker.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.811
Yeah, there's a lot of space
out here.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.519
Yeah, you know I know
your people.

24:49.542 --> 24:51.834
Yeah, I know. What the fuck
that got to do with me, though?

25:09.709 --> 25:11.143
Louis, I was thinking about

25:11.166 --> 25:12.977
that Teddy "Powdergrass"
song you were singing.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.560
Pendergrass, man.

25:14.583 --> 25:17.352
Exactly. I was thinking
how easy it must be

25:17.375 --> 25:21.060
for old-school black dudes
to get laid.

25:21.083 --> 25:24.477
All you got to do is put on
the "Powdergrass,"

25:24.500 --> 25:26.811
roll up some smoking grass,
run a hot bath,

25:26.834 --> 25:31.310
and boom, instant horniness for
whatever chick is listening.

25:31.333 --> 25:35.143
Well, it does help grease
the wheels, Larry.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.060
Hold it for minute,
will you please?

25:38.083 --> 25:39.519
Hold on.

25:39.542 --> 25:41.894
Hey, Ted.
Jerry, what's happening?

25:41.917 --> 25:44.352
Well, Nellis said he lent you

25:44.375 --> 25:47.102
a-a brake spring stretcher
he signed out.

25:47.125 --> 25:50.102
He did, and I gave it
back to him.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.143
Well, he says you still have it.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.894
What?
I don't got it.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.310
I put it right over there.

25:55.333 --> 25:56.811
It's not there, man.
That's bullshit.

25:56.834 --> 25:58.435
I put it on that damn stool
next to him.

25:58.458 --> 25:59.644
All right, all right,
can you hold the work

25:59.667 --> 26:01.102
for a minute, please?

26:01.125 --> 26:04.560
Dansey, will you please
turn the radio off?

26:04.583 --> 26:07.602
All right, now, I'm looking
for a brake spring stretcher,

26:07.625 --> 26:09.769
and I don't want anyone moving
till we find it.

26:09.792 --> 26:11.894
So, Ted...

26:11.917 --> 26:14.018
Where'd it go?
What happened to it?

26:14.041 --> 26:16.102
Well, maybe that damn thing
just fell.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.268
So get on the floor
and start looking,

26:18.291 --> 26:20.435
'cause not one single person
leaving this place

26:20.458 --> 26:21.936
until we find it.

26:21.959 --> 26:24.185
That's just... that's just
the way it is.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.268
I'm gonna find that damn
brake spring stretcher.

26:29.291 --> 26:31.811
I know it's around here
some-motherfucker-where.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.477
All right.

26:35.291 --> 26:37.352
A lot of dangerous stuff
down here on the floor,

26:37.375 --> 26:39.477
so he got to find it,

26:39.500 --> 26:41.769
otherwise gonna be trouble
for everybody.

26:41.792 --> 26:44.268
This dumb motherfucker fell,
nowhere there.

26:44.291 --> 26:47.268
This motherfucker over there.
There it go.

26:47.291 --> 26:50.477
Here's the damn thing, Jerry.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.852
All right, then.

26:51.875 --> 26:55.644
Now, everyone,
if you borrow a tool,

26:55.667 --> 26:58.352
you must replace it directly
in a person's hand,

26:58.375 --> 27:00.185
or we could have a problem.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.018
Can I go back to my station now?

27:02.041 --> 27:03.227
Yes, you can.

27:05.625 --> 27:09.143
Okay, everything's fine now.
Let's get back to work.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.644
Hey, Dansey, would you please
put the radio

27:14.667 --> 27:16.375
back to my station?

27:24.542 --> 27:26.977

28:06.375 --> 28:08.542
I thought about the other day.

28:10.125 --> 28:12.250
I didn't know who you were.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.185
Okay.

28:15.208 --> 28:17.291
I meant you no disrespect.

28:19.083 --> 28:20.291
I'm Beech.

28:24.250 --> 28:25.875
Louis.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.166
All right, then.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.936
Hey, Louis,
let me holler at you.

28:53.959 --> 28:57.500
Hey, Louis, that fine-ass
woman calling you.

29:03.125 --> 29:05.352
What happened at auto body
this morning?

29:05.375 --> 29:08.268
Oh, you know I can't
tell you that, Samantha.

29:08.291 --> 29:09.644
You got a mouth.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.477
Hmm.
Hmm.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.519
I heard Mr. Piner fired
that new guy, Ted.

29:14.542 --> 29:18.477
No, he got mad at him,
but then they found the tool.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.041
Yeah, but I heard they fired
him anyway.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.644
That's news to me.

29:24.667 --> 29:25.852
Well, it won't be no news

29:25.875 --> 29:28.060
when this place goes back
on lockdown.

29:40.375 --> 29:42.811
Hey, Louis.
Ms. Ludlow.

29:42.834 --> 29:44.227
I spoke to your sister.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.686
She said she's got a room
all fixed up for you.

29:46.709 --> 29:48.060
Mm-hmm.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.560
I'm sure she'll have
your favorite meal

29:49.583 --> 29:51.060
all ready for you,
your first day out.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.477
She don't know my favorite meal.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.917
Well, then you should tell her.

29:54.041 --> 29:55.936
Eh, sister burn water.

29:57.166 --> 29:58.686
I'm going to the Golden Corral.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.602
I hear they got
a banana pudding over there...

30:00.625 --> 30:02.352
Out of this world.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.583
Come on in and have a seat.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.519
So the Golden Corral
is not gonna pay you

30:09.542 --> 30:11.352
to eat their banana pudding.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.894
No, ma'am, you're right.

30:12.917 --> 30:16.041
Have you been thinking
about a job strategy?

30:19.125 --> 30:20.686
Since you've been working
in auto body,

30:20.709 --> 30:22.227
why not think about that?

30:22.250 --> 30:24.644
Start making a list of shops
you might apply to.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.686
They can help you type up

30:26.709 --> 30:28.852
your résumé in the library.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.686
And...

30:52.542 --> 30:54.060
Now, you remember

30:54.083 --> 30:56.727
I signed you up for that
restorative justice program?

30:58.417 --> 30:59.686
Really?

30:59.709 --> 31:01.394
It's part of your parole
agreement.

31:01.417 --> 31:04.018
It can really make a difference
in people's lives, Louis,

31:04.041 --> 31:05.394
including yours.

31:05.417 --> 31:08.852
But it's not really
at the top of my list.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.352
I wish we could do more.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.394
Yeah, I know,
I know you're trying.

31:12.417 --> 31:15.727
Yeah, but maybe you can take
some more classes

31:15.750 --> 31:18.102
once you get out.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.917
Maybe.

31:21.959 --> 31:26.018
It's normal to feel nervous
after 24 years.

31:26.041 --> 31:29.894
Um, I really don't want to
talk about this anymore.

31:29.917 --> 31:31.477
Fair enough.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.917
Okay, then, Louis, I will see
you in a couple of weeks.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.268
Yeah, right, Ms. Ludlow.

31:39.291 --> 31:41.769
All right.
I'm gonna see you then.

31:41.792 --> 31:42.936
Yeah.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.476
Yo, what's happening?

35:04.959 --> 35:06.435
Come on, boy.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.644
You need more follow-through.

35:24.667 --> 35:25.977
Only missed by, like, an inch.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.352
That's a inch too much.

35:28.375 --> 35:30.185
Follow-through, see that?

35:30.208 --> 35:31.875
Key to a perfect shot.

35:33.375 --> 35:35.394
See what I'm talking about?
You feel that?

35:35.417 --> 35:36.852
Same way I shot it
the first time.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.477
Nah, you had more extension
that time...

35:38.500 --> 35:40.018
Follow-through.

35:40.041 --> 35:41.602
Do it... do it again.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.310
Yeah.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.018
There you go.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.852
Hey, yo, Beech!

35:46.875 --> 35:48.166
We need one!

35:48.959 --> 35:50.852
Hey, man, I'll holler
at you later, man.

35:50.875 --> 35:53.083
Hey, let me breathe on you
for a second.

35:55.542 --> 35:57.602
You know, normally I ain't one
to preach.

35:57.625 --> 35:59.227
And I mind
my own fucking business.

35:59.250 --> 36:02.769
But running with them...
No future in it,

36:02.792 --> 36:04.602
especially with what's
going on right now.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.227
When it pop off,
you be the first to get it.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.268
You just saying that shit
'cause you don't like 'em.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.018
Who said I don't like them?

36:11.041 --> 36:12.727
Terry.
It's obvious, man.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.811
You used to be the mayor, right?

36:14.834 --> 36:18.208
Hey, let's go, motherfucker.
Fuck that.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.560
Hey...

36:21.583 --> 36:24.602
dignity, self-respect, grace...

36:24.625 --> 36:27.143
At the end of the day,
that's what you want

36:27.166 --> 36:29.060
to try to hold on to in here.

36:29.083 --> 36:33.083
Might not mean much to you now,
but it's something to remember.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.644
Let's ball, man.

36:55.667 --> 36:56.894
Louis?
Hey.

36:56.917 --> 36:58.477
Yeah.
Louis Menkins, right?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.352
Okay. Louis, we're just
gonna go over here

37:00.375 --> 37:02.894
and have a-a private room,
and we'll have a chat.

37:02.917 --> 37:04.477
Does that work?
Yeah.

37:04.500 --> 37:07.727
Great, great. Um, sorry,
did I introduce myself?

37:07.750 --> 37:09.143
No.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.769
You can all me John Pinkins,
or Johnny's fine.

37:10.792 --> 37:14.227
I'll be your parole officer
for your release,

37:14.250 --> 37:15.602
you know, during your parole,

37:15.625 --> 37:17.769
for any supervision,
assistance...

37:17.792 --> 37:19.477
After you.
All right.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.644
Thanks.

37:20.667 --> 37:24.185
So I read your case file before,

37:24.208 --> 37:26.727
but I was just... yeah,
just brushing up on it.

37:26.750 --> 37:31.227
And... okay, uh,
I'm gonna have a mint.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.875
Am I allowed to give you a mint?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.208
Do you want a mint?
I'm all right.

37:37.625 --> 37:40.644
Okay, so what I can tell
from your... your file is...

37:40.667 --> 37:43.291
Yeah, I'll have a mint.
Here.

37:44.834 --> 37:47.310
Um...

37:47.333 --> 37:52.394
so it looks like
your release date is...

37:52.417 --> 37:53.811
July 18th,

37:53.834 --> 37:56.477
uh, at which point
will have been incarcerated

37:56.500 --> 37:58.727
for exactly 24 years
and 3 months

37:58.750 --> 38:00.602
of a 60-year sentence,

38:00.625 --> 38:05.018
which was cut to 30
and has been reduced to 24...

38:05.041 --> 38:06.310
24-3.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.852
Dash three due to
good behavior/time cuts.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.435
Time cuts.
Is that correct?

38:09.458 --> 38:10.644
Fantastic.

38:10.667 --> 38:13.519
Do you have any, uh, questions
about that?

38:13.542 --> 38:16.185
On that? Nope.

38:16.208 --> 38:19.352
Okay, um...

38:19.375 --> 38:22.936
I see that your parole
is pretty standard.

38:22.959 --> 38:27.352
"Required to remain in Indiana
for a two-year duration."

38:27.375 --> 38:28.769
Okay?

38:28.792 --> 38:30.727
"Upon your release, you'll be
given a check for $100."

38:30.750 --> 38:32.477
Uh, plus my pay, right?

38:32.500 --> 38:36.352
It should be, uh,
754 on the 18th.

38:36.375 --> 38:37.519
Mm-hmm.

38:37.542 --> 38:39.811
After the prison take its cut.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.894
Mm-hmm.
Victim fund and whatnot.

38:42.917 --> 38:45.185
Mm-hmm.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.268
Okay, uh, sorry,
I wasn't aware of that,

38:47.291 --> 38:50.018
but I will look into it.

38:50.041 --> 38:52.644
So we're all good.

38:52.667 --> 38:57.644
They, uh... they have
any job-placement programs

38:57.667 --> 38:59.936
for people just getting out?

38:59.959 --> 39:01.394
Oh, you mean like
a halfway house?

39:01.417 --> 39:03.102
No, I mean like job placement,

39:03.125 --> 39:05.060
you know, skills training,
anything?

39:05.083 --> 39:06.894
Uh, is it something

39:06.917 --> 39:08.894
you've spoken
to your social worker about?

39:08.917 --> 39:11.268
Uh, she just deals with stuff
on the inside.

39:11.291 --> 39:15.310
Um, I mean, there's nothing
formal that we're set up to do,

39:15.333 --> 39:18.394
but I can certainly advise you
of job opportunities that...

39:18.417 --> 39:20.519
As they come up.

39:20.542 --> 39:23.625
Um, Louis, do you have
a college degree?

39:24.917 --> 39:26.352
How about a GED?

39:26.375 --> 39:27.917
Yeah.
Great.

39:29.709 --> 39:32.060
So you're comfortable
with reading and writing

39:32.083 --> 39:33.894
and all that?

39:35.875 --> 39:38.250
I'm fine.
Okay.

39:41.583 --> 39:43.250
Okay, great.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.435
Okay, cool.

39:48.417 --> 39:49.852
Oh, and there's our time.

39:49.875 --> 39:54.060
Um, so I'm gonna look
into the skills thing, okay?

39:54.083 --> 39:56.852
And I'm gonna totally do that.

39:56.875 --> 40:00.268
Um, I really look forward
to this.

40:00.291 --> 40:01.435
Cool?

40:01.458 --> 40:03.519
Yeah, cool.

40:03.542 --> 40:05.417
Okay, cool.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.602
Cool.

40:17.291 --> 40:20.143
Big Black, what's good?
It's lit, it's lit.

40:20.166 --> 40:22.602
Hey, what's up, Louis?
Yo, yo, yo.

40:27.166 --> 40:29.477
Yeah, my fault I'm late.
Yeah.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.852
Where were you?

40:30.875 --> 40:34.102
I had to run by admin,
check in with my PO.

40:34.125 --> 40:35.310
Oh.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.811
Excited about getting out?

40:36.834 --> 40:39.268
You know, wouldn't you be?

40:39.291 --> 40:41.811
Probably a whole mix
of emotions, you know?

40:41.834 --> 40:45.477
Like I said, it ain't always
easy on the outside either.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.602
Oh, you're talking
about your wife.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.644
No, granted, she ain't
the first person

40:49.667 --> 40:51.727
to ever come down
with lung cancer, but...

40:51.750 --> 40:53.310
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.875
Yeah, thank you, Louis.

40:58.375 --> 41:02.394
Yeah, so, uh, what happened
yesterday with Ted, though?

41:02.417 --> 41:05.894
Oh, it turns out
he was trying to steal

41:05.917 --> 41:07.227
that spring stretcher.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.435
How you figure?

41:08.458 --> 41:09.686
Because Jonesy
told me he saw him

41:09.709 --> 41:11.018
put it in the welder on purpose.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.602
Jonesy told you that?

41:12.625 --> 41:14.060
Yeah, but I don't want to get
Jonesy in trouble.

41:14.083 --> 41:15.644
That's between you and me,
all right?

41:15.667 --> 41:17.644
I mean, we got to keep
this group tight,

41:17.667 --> 41:21.060
otherwise they're gonna
eliminate the whole program.

41:21.083 --> 41:22.977
Yeah, I hear you.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.018
Who are you gonna
replace him with?

41:25.041 --> 41:26.852
Well, you got any
recommendations?

41:26.875 --> 41:29.477
Well, there's this new kid
named Beecher...

41:29.500 --> 41:31.644
No, I don't... I don't hire
new kids, you know that.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.936
I just thought
he might be a nice fit.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.268
I'm fixing to retire.

41:35.291 --> 41:37.352
Might be nice to get
some young blood in here.

41:37.375 --> 41:39.041
All right, well...

41:41.250 --> 41:44.143
Well, we'll think about it,
all right?

41:44.166 --> 41:46.936
In the meantime, let's get you
set up for work.

41:46.959 --> 41:49.268
All right.

41:51.041 --> 41:54.125
Hey, Charles, you good.
Go ahead and drive, man.

41:56.625 --> 41:57.917
Hold on, hold on.

42:00.083 --> 42:01.917
Louis.
Yo.

42:03.458 --> 42:06.394
I'm going to your city one day.

42:06.417 --> 42:07.644
I like New York.

42:07.667 --> 42:09.125
I hear you.

42:09.959 --> 42:14.227
It might be a couple years...
a couple years or so, you know.

42:14.250 --> 42:16.060
All right, there you go,
pull up.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.602
Hey, Charlie.
Yeah.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.310
Hey, I appreciate it, man.

42:28.333 --> 42:31.625
Hey, everyone need help
every now and then, Louis.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.435
All right.

43:08.959 --> 43:10.435
Just put it right there.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.060
Meet Beecher.
How you doing?

43:20.083 --> 43:21.143
All right.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.602
Hey, Beech, check it.

43:35.625 --> 43:37.375
Yeah.
Come on.

43:40.333 --> 43:42.435
You know anything about cars?
Yeah, actually, I do.

43:42.458 --> 43:45.268
My pops used to fix them up
for fun back in the day.

43:45.291 --> 43:46.477
Which day?

43:46.500 --> 43:48.310
I just meant when I was younger.

43:48.333 --> 43:49.852
Dickies or onesie?

43:49.875 --> 43:50.936
Fuck a onesie.

43:50.959 --> 43:52.542
Dickies?
No doubt.

43:54.375 --> 43:55.852
Pops still around?

43:55.875 --> 43:57.750
Nah, he cut out on us.

43:59.041 --> 44:00.018
He teach you anything?

44:00.041 --> 44:01.519
He didn't teach me shit.

44:01.542 --> 44:03.352
Taught his brother,
so I learned from him.

44:03.375 --> 44:04.709
Boom. Hold this.

44:07.041 --> 44:09.519
You gonna give me this?

44:09.542 --> 44:11.435
It's possible.

44:11.458 --> 44:12.852
Why?

44:12.875 --> 44:15.268
Maybe just trying to help
the next man get along.

44:15.291 --> 44:17.102
Grab you a rag, too.

44:17.125 --> 44:20.602
Why is that so important?

44:20.625 --> 44:22.709
I don't really know.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.185
Karma.

44:26.208 --> 44:29.811
Either that or fuck with Terry.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.394
Just don't fuck it up.

44:31.417 --> 44:33.477
A lot of motherfuckers
would kill for this.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.769
Better than sitting
in your cell all day

44:34.792 --> 44:36.352
rotting your brain
and watching TV.

44:36.375 --> 44:38.394
Here, put a little fat
on your head,

44:38.417 --> 44:41.268
make you a little cheese while
you're doing it... dollar a day.

44:41.291 --> 44:43.936
Hey, Louis, you want to get
back to work on this Sunfire?

44:43.959 --> 44:46.352
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

44:46.375 --> 44:49.583
So... you know I knew
about cars, huh?

44:51.125 --> 44:53.102
Sixth sense.

44:53.125 --> 44:55.894
Right.
Crap.

44:55.917 --> 44:57.852
Let's go.
Yeah, let's go, Beech.

44:57.875 --> 45:01.352
Hit the fucking shot, boy.
Let's go.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.352
Uh-oh, he got it.

45:03.375 --> 45:05.727
Ooh, what the fuck
I'm talking about, boy.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.894
Whoo!
Man, that boy got skills.

45:07.917 --> 45:09.060
Who?

45:09.083 --> 45:11.268
New kid who just won that game.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.894
Beech.
Beech?

45:12.917 --> 45:15.185
Beech, Beecher.
Fuck, I don't know.

45:15.208 --> 45:17.227
Is that the kid you got
in auto body?

45:17.250 --> 45:18.435
Which one?

45:18.458 --> 45:19.894
The fucking kid
we're talking about.

45:19.917 --> 45:22.083
Right there, the fucking
Beech kid.

45:24.041 --> 45:25.268
Yeah.

45:25.291 --> 45:26.936
Why'd you get him
into auto body?

45:26.959 --> 45:28.477
You got that kid into auto body?

45:28.500 --> 45:30.394
I mentioned him to Piner.
You didn't mention me?

45:30.417 --> 45:31.769
I didn't know you wanted in.

45:31.792 --> 45:33.060
Man, I've been trying to get
into auto body

45:33.083 --> 45:34.686
for three fucking years, man.

45:34.709 --> 45:36.102
I didn't know that.
Shit.

45:36.125 --> 45:38.644
You knew Beans wanted in
auto body.

45:38.667 --> 45:40.602
I didn't know.
Shit.

45:40.625 --> 45:41.977
Why you got to say it like that?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.268
"Shit."

45:43.291 --> 45:44.602
Like what?

45:44.625 --> 45:45.894
Like you're a motherfucking
black man.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.185
I was just saying shit.

45:47.208 --> 45:49.143
Nah, man, you said "shiiit."

45:49.166 --> 45:51.936
That's the way I talk, yo.
Oh, Jesus.

45:51.959 --> 45:53.602
Nah, now you're saying "yo."

45:53.625 --> 45:56.143
I can't say yo?
Nah, man, not like "yo."

45:56.166 --> 45:57.602
I didn't say it like that.

45:57.625 --> 45:59.102
Shit.

45:59.125 --> 46:00.936
Motherfucker been in prison
ten fucking years,

46:00.959 --> 46:02.185
and now he want to act

46:02.208 --> 46:03.686
like he's
from the motherfucking hood.

46:03.709 --> 46:05.352
I am from the hood.
I'm from South Bend, fool.

46:05.375 --> 46:06.894
Bitch, you from Granger.
No, I'm not.

46:06.917 --> 46:08.811
Well, Edwardsburg or some shit.

46:08.834 --> 46:10.435
It's just outside of South Bend.

46:10.458 --> 46:12.102
It's motherfucking farmland
and shit out there.

46:12.125 --> 46:13.602
Not all of it.

46:13.625 --> 46:15.143
You got fucking cows
and pigs and shit.

46:15.166 --> 46:17.268
I used to go to South Bend
to buy my drugs, man.

46:17.291 --> 46:19.352
And that's where they capped
your motherfucking ass.

46:19.375 --> 46:20.894
Yeah.

46:20.917 --> 46:22.602
Motherfucker going
into the hood talking about,

46:22.625 --> 46:24.977
"Yo, you got some motherfucking
marijuana and 'shiiit'?"

46:25.000 --> 46:26.894
Nigga, please.

46:26.917 --> 46:28.977
Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.602
White niggas kill me
with that shit.

46:33.625 --> 46:35.519
Hey, that's how y'all talk
about me?

46:35.542 --> 46:37.769
Get the kid a stick, man.

47:12.125 --> 47:13.310
Bring your ass over here.

47:13.333 --> 47:15.310
Get your fucking hands off me.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.060
Boy, if you don't put
the shit right back

47:17.083 --> 47:18.394
where you found it...

47:18.417 --> 47:19.519
What's wrong with you?
Who did that?

47:19.542 --> 47:21.102
Some white motherfucker.

47:21.125 --> 47:22.727
Well, then use these instead
of lifting shit out of here.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.519
That's on me, who put his word
on the line

47:24.542 --> 47:26.060
to get you in here.

47:26.083 --> 47:27.727
You better have that shit back
by the end of the day.

47:27.750 --> 47:29.268
Or else what?
Don't fuck with me, Beech.

47:29.291 --> 47:30.560
Whatever.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.060
Don't fucking
"whatever" me either.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.375
Get the fuck out of here
with that shit.

47:42.667 --> 47:46.519
How's your little protégée
working out?

47:46.542 --> 47:48.727
I ain't got nothing to do
with him.

47:48.750 --> 47:52.143
Oh, come on, Piner says
he's your guy.

47:52.166 --> 47:54.644
You know, Larry...

47:54.667 --> 47:56.727
half the time you be all up
in people business

47:56.750 --> 47:59.268
and don't know shit.

47:59.291 --> 48:01.102
What's up with you?

48:01.125 --> 48:03.667
Wrong side of the bed
this morning?

48:05.792 --> 48:08.143
Listen, I was
with this woman once.

48:08.166 --> 48:10.102
Actually, it was three women.

48:10.125 --> 48:13.352
Great night, fantastic.

48:13.375 --> 48:16.936
Got up the next morning,
wrong side of the bed.

48:16.959 --> 48:21.435
Later in the day,
I caught my first case.

48:21.458 --> 48:23.268
All that bank stuff went down.

48:23.291 --> 48:25.936
That's why I'm here
all these years with you.

48:25.959 --> 48:27.185
You must have thought

48:27.208 --> 48:29.310
all that pussy
was gonna pay for itself.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.936
Seemed worth it at the time.
Huh.

48:32.959 --> 48:34.644
That's pretty good.

48:34.667 --> 48:35.977
I got it.

49:07.667 --> 49:09.792
Still mad at me?

49:13.959 --> 49:16.166
I put that fucking thing back.

49:21.417 --> 49:25.185
I see you eating
that bullshit-ass goulash.

49:25.208 --> 49:27.435
Half the time I eat in my cell.

49:27.458 --> 49:30.102
I thought you didn't have
no more side hustles.

49:30.125 --> 49:32.143
Frosted Flakes
costs $3.20 a box.

49:34.709 --> 49:37.018
I got my pay.

49:37.041 --> 49:38.936
Plus, you know, I wager
on the side.

49:38.959 --> 49:41.041
What you reading?

49:42.417 --> 49:46.686
"War Against the Weak."
Eugenics.

49:46.709 --> 49:48.936
America's attempt to create
a master race

49:48.959 --> 49:52.435
by breeding out
the so-called weak.

49:52.458 --> 49:55.018
Why you reading that?

49:55.041 --> 49:57.268
Trying to understand
the history of why things are

49:57.291 --> 49:58.727
the way they are around here.

49:58.750 --> 50:02.102
In this place?
Everywhere.

50:02.125 --> 50:06.542
A lot of forces at play that
helped get us to where we got.

50:07.709 --> 50:10.227
Maybe if I knew then
what I know now,

50:10.250 --> 50:11.560
made some smarter choices,

50:11.583 --> 50:14.417
done things differently,
feel me?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.519
Look, man...

50:18.542 --> 50:20.602
me and Terry are both
from South Bend, East Side.

50:20.625 --> 50:21.936
He like family.
Yeah?

50:21.959 --> 50:23.602
What'd he get you for Christmas
last year?

50:23.625 --> 50:25.102
So, what, I should just go
tell him to fuck hisself?

50:25.125 --> 50:27.083
Outlast him.
Is that what you did?

50:28.917 --> 50:31.227
Ain't it true you used
to run shit around here?

50:31.250 --> 50:32.727
I head you was mad OG.

50:32.750 --> 50:34.268
I wouldn't say that.

50:34.291 --> 50:36.602
They said you had runners
inside and outside the wall,

50:36.625 --> 50:38.060
get your hands on anything
you want.

50:38.083 --> 50:40.769
I did my business.
Just don't get nowhere.

50:40.792 --> 50:42.727
It do if it gets you
what you want.

50:42.750 --> 50:44.602
What it got me was in the hole,

50:44.625 --> 50:46.227
which ain't good for your head.

50:46.250 --> 50:49.602
If I was you, I'd do my bid,
get the fuck out.

50:49.625 --> 50:52.435
How long you got?
50, do 25.

50:52.458 --> 50:54.519
Shit, you'd be younger than me.

50:54.542 --> 50:57.602
Put something on your mind...

50:57.625 --> 50:59.602
Stay clear of these
motherfuckers,

50:59.625 --> 51:02.936
'cause they will take your life
if you give it to them.

51:02.959 --> 51:04.936
Seem like I got to be here
for a while,

51:04.959 --> 51:06.602
so I might as well just
get comfortable.

51:11.709 --> 51:14.018
What are you looking at?

51:18.458 --> 51:23.060
You know, I had one friend
the whole time I've been down.

51:23.083 --> 51:26.102
One true friend.

51:26.125 --> 51:30.602
Name was Russell,
but they called him "Moses."

51:30.625 --> 51:35.018
Moses did run this whole joint.

51:35.041 --> 51:37.435
Had to see who was working
for him, inmates.

51:37.458 --> 51:38.852
You know the deal,
recruited his bitches,

51:38.875 --> 51:40.227
had them motherfuckers
bring in shit

51:40.250 --> 51:41.394
straight through the front door,

51:41.417 --> 51:43.102
warden looking the other way.

51:43.125 --> 51:45.143
But after... after a while...

51:45.166 --> 51:48.519
It started getting
too hot for him.

51:48.542 --> 51:50.018
Got thrown in the hole.

51:50.041 --> 51:51.852
Caught a couple cases
up in here,

51:51.875 --> 51:53.435
got 20 years added
to his sentence.

51:53.458 --> 51:55.519
He was already in for 70,
so at a certain point,

51:55.542 --> 51:58.018
he... he just couldn't take
that pressure no more,

51:58.041 --> 51:59.500
couldn't part the waters.

52:00.333 --> 52:04.310
One night, he went back
to his cell,

52:04.333 --> 52:07.310
grabbed a razor,
slit both his wrists,

52:07.333 --> 52:10.417
then cut his throat
ear to motherfucking ear.

52:13.208 --> 52:14.769
And that was the end of Moses.

52:14.792 --> 52:18.018
I wouldn't do that.
You say that now.

52:18.041 --> 52:20.477
Trust me.

52:20.500 --> 52:22.000
You know...

52:24.166 --> 52:25.977
Play too hard, it take its toll.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.519
I know that's when
I stepped back.

52:30.542 --> 52:33.686
OG, shit about to pop off.

52:33.709 --> 52:35.394
See how it play out.

52:35.417 --> 52:37.352
I got to go ride with them, bro.

52:37.375 --> 52:39.769
Let the bees be still, son.

52:56.166 --> 52:58.227
Hell, no!
Major fight...

53:04.250 --> 53:06.018
Damn fucking Syndicates, man!

53:14.750 --> 53:16.602
Come on!
Knock his ass out!

53:42.041 --> 53:44.166
I'm not a fucking snitch!

53:45.375 --> 53:48.227
Fucking pigs!
All right, turn around.

53:48.250 --> 53:49.686
Turn around.

53:49.709 --> 53:52.060
No!

53:52.083 --> 53:55.394
Stop resisting!
Stop resisting!

53:55.417 --> 53:56.769
Young man, stop resisting.

53:59.834 --> 54:02.769
Fuck this...

54:02.792 --> 54:05.227
Fuck that!

54:05.250 --> 54:07.894
Get your fucking... get
your fucking hands off me.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.060
Hey, Marcus,
it's... it's your pops.

54:41.083 --> 54:42.060
Hi.

54:42.083 --> 54:43.936
Yeah, so...

54:43.959 --> 54:46.185
you remember I'm getting
out of here next month?

54:46.208 --> 54:47.769
Yeah.

54:47.792 --> 54:49.811
So I'm... I'm over here
trying to keep to myself,

54:49.834 --> 54:52.060
but, you know, I can't leave

54:52.083 --> 54:53.602
the state of Indiana, you know,

54:53.625 --> 54:55.394
'cause of my parole conditions.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.060
And then on top of that,

54:57.083 --> 55:00.352
I really haven't put that much
away since I've been down,

55:00.375 --> 55:01.936
so I don't even know

55:01.959 --> 55:05.644
how I'll even get all the way
out there to California.

55:05.667 --> 55:08.268
No.

55:08.291 --> 55:10.519
But that's... now, I'm not
asking you.

55:10.542 --> 55:12.894
Marcus, hold on.
Hold on.

55:12.917 --> 55:15.333
Hold on.
Hold on one minute.

55:21.875 --> 55:25.310
Yeah, yeah, here's Sonia.
Hey, hey, Marcus.

55:25.333 --> 55:27.018
Marcus, don't...
Don't put her on yet.

55:27.041 --> 55:28.227
Hey.
Hi.

55:28.250 --> 55:31.018
Hey.
Hey, there, baby girl.

55:31.041 --> 55:33.811
H-how you doing, Sonia?

55:35.250 --> 55:39.060
Uh, that's great.
I'm good, I'm good.

55:39.083 --> 55:41.477
Huh?

55:41.500 --> 55:43.644
Yeah, of course I'm still
working on it.

55:43.667 --> 55:46.811
I got... I got it almost all
sketched out.

55:46.834 --> 55:49.394
I think... I think
you're gonna like it a lot.

55:49.417 --> 55:50.769
I can't wait to see it.

55:50.792 --> 55:52.394
I can't wait
for you to see it, too.

55:52.417 --> 55:55.268
And...
I need to go.

55:55.291 --> 55:57.041
Oh, okay, then.

56:00.083 --> 56:02.083
I love you.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.894
Here's the starting lineup

56:21.917 --> 56:23.310
and the changes.

56:23.333 --> 56:25.268
Andrew Bogut's out
with an injury.

56:25.291 --> 56:27.560
Andre Iguodala will come off
the bench...

56:27.583 --> 56:31.102
Hey, Menkins, they're asking
to see you again.

56:31.125 --> 56:34.352
For what?
Row five.

56:34.375 --> 56:35.769
Your guess is as good as mine.

56:35.792 --> 56:38.769
Don't ask 'cause I'm not
a mind reader.

56:38.792 --> 56:40.811
Maybe it's about you
getting out.

56:40.834 --> 56:42.435
Hmm.

56:42.458 --> 56:44.268
Hands up.

56:44.291 --> 56:46.686
Spread your fingers, show me
the backs of your hands.

56:46.709 --> 56:48.018
Reach your hand across
your face,

56:48.041 --> 56:49.519
pull your ear back.

56:49.542 --> 56:51.435
Turn toward me.

56:51.458 --> 56:54.936
Run your fingers through
your beard.

56:54.959 --> 56:57.185
And open your mouth for me.

56:57.208 --> 56:59.959
Take your fingers,
pull your cheeks apart.

57:01.375 --> 57:05.477
Raise your upper lip,
bottom lip,

57:05.500 --> 57:07.185
stick your tongue out.

57:07.208 --> 57:09.000
Turn for me.

57:10.750 --> 57:13.060
Keep turning.

57:13.083 --> 57:14.394
Stop.

57:14.417 --> 57:16.709
Bend at the waist,
spread your buttocks.

57:18.917 --> 57:21.000
And get dressed.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.625
Have a good day.

57:56.875 --> 57:59.519
Thanks for sitting
with us, Louis.

57:59.542 --> 58:01.519
As you know...

58:01.542 --> 58:02.977
Does he know?

58:03.000 --> 58:06.686
Investigator Baxter handles
STGs in Pendleton.

58:06.709 --> 58:09.268
Security threat groups...
Gangs.

58:09.291 --> 58:10.686
I know what they are.

58:10.709 --> 58:14.018
Great, so then you know
it's serious business.

58:14.041 --> 58:15.686
Yeah, I do.

58:15.709 --> 58:17.894
So then you probably
also know we've had a situation

58:17.917 --> 58:20.268
that's arisen due to an attack
on the leader

58:20.291 --> 58:23.811
of the Syndicate Crew up
at Indiana State Penitentiary.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.727
I heard some rumors.

58:25.750 --> 58:30.102
Well, clearly, they're more
than rumors at this point.

58:30.125 --> 58:34.477
Now, I understand that you
spoke to Investigator Danvers

58:34.500 --> 58:37.894
and that you decided that you
did not want to share

58:37.917 --> 58:39.727
whatever knowledge
you might have,

58:39.750 --> 58:42.060
but given subsequent
developments,

58:42.083 --> 58:44.769
I'd like to give you
a second chance.

58:44.792 --> 58:48.727
So, you, uh, march me in here

58:48.750 --> 58:50.644
for the entire population

58:50.667 --> 58:53.977
to see me coming in here again
to talk you.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.310
They have no reason to suspect

58:55.333 --> 58:56.727
what you're being asked.
Bullshit.

58:56.750 --> 58:58.394
You monitor gangs
for the fucking prison.

58:58.417 --> 58:59.894
Louis...
Oh, sorry, STGs.

58:59.917 --> 59:01.644
What do you want me
to do, Louis?

59:01.667 --> 59:03.394
Communicate with you via text?

59:03.417 --> 59:05.560
I don't have a phone.
Yeah?

59:05.583 --> 59:07.625
Sure about that?

59:10.667 --> 59:13.769
The point is, I know
your standing in the prison.

59:13.792 --> 59:15.936
So I'd like you to take
this opportunity

59:15.959 --> 59:17.686
to tell me anything you know

59:17.709 --> 59:20.310
about what Terry Macklin is
planning against the Syndicate.

59:20.333 --> 59:22.477
I don't know nothing.
I don't believe you.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.102
That's your problem.

59:24.125 --> 59:25.769
Don't fuck with me, Louis.

59:25.792 --> 59:27.310
I can make life really hard
for you in here.

59:27.333 --> 59:29.143
Fuck you, worm.
Don't fucking threaten me.

59:29.166 --> 59:30.977
All right, Louis, calm down.
I'll fucking threaten you.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.602
I'll do whatever
I need to fucking do

59:32.625 --> 59:34.769
to maintain the safety
of the offender population.

59:34.792 --> 59:37.102
I bet you will.
I know you know things!

59:37.125 --> 59:38.519
Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

59:38.542 --> 59:40.102
Same like I told Danvers here,

59:40.125 --> 59:43.018
who at least had the decency
to ask instead of demand.

59:43.041 --> 59:44.894
Don't you ever call me in here
and walk me across the yard

59:44.917 --> 59:46.435
like a bitch-ass snitch.

59:46.458 --> 59:48.811
Have some respect before
I smack the fucking cum taste

59:48.834 --> 59:50.310
out your mouth.

59:50.333 --> 59:51.811
Fuck you.

59:55.250 --> 59:56.644
Louis.

59:56.667 --> 01:00:00.000
I'm sorry.
Come on. Louis.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.477
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.143
I shouldn't have let him
talk to you like that.

01:00:05.166 --> 01:00:06.477
Motherfucking worm.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.458
Come on, come on.
He's just doing his job.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.644
We also shouldn't have
brought you over like that,

01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:12.894
but you got to be careful.

01:00:12.917 --> 01:00:14.102
Of what?

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:15.769
Well, for one thing,
that Beecher kid...

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:17.268
We know he's gonna get patched.

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:19.394
It's in your best interest
to stay away from him.

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:21.811
The kid just need
a friend, Mike.

01:00:21.834 --> 01:00:24.310
Yeah, well, don't forget
the oldest prison rule...

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:26.477
Anyone who wants to be
your friend,

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.352
watch the fuck out for them.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.268
You motherfuckers,
stay out of my shit.

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:45.644
Second crew, J cell, 7-13!

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:48.352
Get your punk ass down now.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:49.977
Hit that son of a bitch.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.727
Stop resisting.
Stop resisting.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.018
Stop resisting, stop resisting.

01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:57.727
Man, fuck all y'all.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:58.936
Get off me.
Get up.

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.686
Keeping free of this mess?

01:02:53.709 --> 01:02:55.519
You know how it is.

01:02:55.542 --> 01:02:56.811
East Side roll with U.I.,

01:02:56.834 --> 01:02:58.560
especially when shit
about to go down.

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:01.018
Always some dog shit
to step over.

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:03.811
I already told you...
We're both East Side.

01:03:03.834 --> 01:03:06.977
Joint about to pop off
black and white.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.977
You know I got to rep mine.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.268
Just like that, right?

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.852
The Syndicate dude probably
owed money so they hit him,

01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:19.185
or, fuck, you don't know...

01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:20.977
Maybe it's some lover bullshit
or something.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.977
But now all of a sudden, it's
a black-and-white thing, huh?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.143
I don't give a fuck
what it's about.

01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.227
It don't even matter.

01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:43.310
You think Terry is willing
to die for you

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:46.185
'cause you from the East Side?

01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:48.686
The prison let this gang
shit survive

01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:50.519
'cause the prison want it.

01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:56.018
It's all a game.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.268
In 1992, I was at a pay phone,

01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:13.227
and a man, this man,
came up to me.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.894
He was planning on stealing
my car,

01:04:15.917 --> 01:04:17.894
and he put a gun...

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:21.435
point blank in my face
and fired.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.727
I spent eight years in prison.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.727
When I got out,
there was a court hearing,

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.310
and Janice and her family
were there.

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.894
And at a certain point, I asked
the judge if I could speak.

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:36.102
When I did, Janice's family
started shouting me down

01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:37.936
before I could get going.

01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:41.936
Ten years after that,
I looked Sean up.

01:04:41.959 --> 01:04:43.352
And when I found him,
I asked him,

01:04:43.375 --> 01:04:45.852
"What were you trying to say
to me that day?"

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:49.583
And he said,
"I wanted to apologize"...

01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:54.185
Which began a conversation.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.936
And here we are now, wanting
to continue that conversation

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.435
with people like you.

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:01.435
The victim participant
in your case

01:05:01.458 --> 01:05:06.018
is Karen James,
sister of the deceased.

01:05:06.041 --> 01:05:09.602
She's obviously been living
with and processing this crime

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:12.644
for many years,
but she signed up.

01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:15.102
And I can tell you
firsthand, Louis,

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:18.936
to look your victim
or, in this case, a relative,

01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:23.977
in the eye and own
what you did...

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.811
not easy.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:29.644
But I promise you,
it'll be worth it.

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.894
The three values
of restorative justice

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:36.709
are encounter, amends,
and reintegration.

01:05:38.709 --> 01:05:41.977
I shot a man,
and I robbed his house

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.769
while his dying body
was in the trunk of my car.

01:05:44.792 --> 01:05:48.560
How do I make amends for that?

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:52.018
We're not out to fix.

01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:55.102
You can't repair the harm
you've done.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:58.435
But to sit with her...

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:00.310
to tell her how you feel

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:03.310
can help repair
the harm done to her.

01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:05.185
And to you, Louis.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.852
To own what you did is to heal.

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:24.185
Someone wants to talk to you.

01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:36.560
I ain't gonna
say it again, brother.

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:38.185
Move.

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:54.310
Afternoon, Louis.

01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:55.644
Terry.

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:12.686
I imagine you've been
expecting this.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:14.583
Fuck you. This what?

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:18.227
Fuck me. This what?

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:24.250
That's how you feel when you
say fuck me like that, huh?

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.352
So what do I have to do?

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:31.227
I have an iron hand...
without the velvet glove.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:34.435
What'd you call me
down here for, dude?

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:36.102
We need Beecher with us.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:38.602
So I'm gonna ask you to stop
putting shit on his mind.

01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:40.644
I got a organization to run.

01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:44.268
Things are tight,
I need to value he has.

01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:48.083
He got good hands, he's smart,
he's an asset.

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:51.435
Now, Macon offered
to cut you in.

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:53.500
I don't want no part of that.

01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:56.727
That's your decision.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.083
Relax.

01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:01.769
But I can't have you talking
with Danvers or Baxter

01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:04.102
or any other
motherfucking officer

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:06.310
or administrative official here.

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:08.394
You feel me?

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.102
We through?
No.

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:13.352
I got a price on my head, Louis.

01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:16.685
Last thing I need is you
interfering.

01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:18.644
Now, are we good?

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:22.310
And now, are you through?

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:45.875
You know what time it is.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.727
Get out the way, man.

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.519
Louis, can I holler at you
a little bit?

01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:37.227
Yo, you got that 30?

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:40.060
No, man, but I got a little
something else for you, though.

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:41.769
A little knowledge that fell
from a tree.

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:43.560
Man, I'm out of this joint
in a week, Pete.

01:09:43.582 --> 01:09:45.185
That don't affect me.

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:46.477
Not if it's going down

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.352
like it's supposed to
in auto body.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:51.227
Not if what's going down?

01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:56.227
They're supposed to be
bringing a whistle in.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.769
A piece?

01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:00.602
Yeah, a fucking gun,
through the auto body, man.

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:03.977
Where you hear that?
The ear hustle, man.

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:08.769
Who bringing it?
You work up in there.

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.560
So we good on that 30?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.477
Hey, yo, Patrick, you got a sec?

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.227
Sure, what's up, Louis?

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:36.102
Brah, I heard there's a strap
coming through auto body.

01:10:36.125 --> 01:10:37.519
Is it for you?

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:40.125
Come on, let's go.

01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:46.811
If I needed a piece,

01:10:46.834 --> 01:10:48.268
I wouldn't bring it in
like that.

01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:49.602
Why not?

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:50.811
Can't trust Piner.

01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:52.268
Why?

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.102
He's working both sides.

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.644
Jerry Piner?

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:57.060
You didn't know that?

01:10:58.458 --> 01:11:00.811
Terry's been controlling Piner
for the last year.

01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:04.560
Piner looks away,
Terry brings in phones.

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:08.811
So now Piner's letting Terry
bring in a piece?

01:11:08.834 --> 01:11:09.977
Piner's got no choice.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.143
Terry's got
a paper trail on him.

01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:14.102
Plus, he needs it.

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:16.143
Piner's got a sick wife.

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:22.435
Okay, so, who's picking it up
when it come through?

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:25.143
You sure you want to know
all this?

01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:26.519
Knowledge ain't always
a good thing...

01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:29.018
Man, just tell me who moving it.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:32.102
Whoever you placed in there
most recently, Louis.

01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:34.102
Beecher.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:38.769
He's not STG, no
affiliation, he knows cars...

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:40.185
Putty in Terry's hands.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:43.519
Terry got Beecher that job
to bring in heat.

01:11:43.542 --> 01:11:47.352
That's why he got that dude
Ted fired out of there.

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:54.352
You thought you got
little Beecher that job?

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:57.083
You know Terry's
gonna use the kid.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.185
Yeah.

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:03.917
Thanks, man.

01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:07.477

Have a good weekend.

01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:32.894
Hey, how's it going, Louis?

01:12:32.917 --> 01:12:34.435
Kind of slow.

01:12:34.458 --> 01:12:37.435
Anything new coming in, Jerry?

01:12:37.458 --> 01:12:41.227
Well, we're supposed to get
a pickup in a few days.

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:44.268
Oh, yeah.
Where's it coming from?

01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:48.018
A friend of a guard

Macon's guy on upper J.
You like it?

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:25.959
What the fuck you doing, man?

01:13:29.166 --> 01:13:30.602
What, you don't got to
answer me now?

01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:32.477
What the fuck
you want me to say?

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.894
You seriously gonna do this?

01:13:33.917 --> 01:13:35.268
Do what?

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:39.750
Get brothers killed.

01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:46.143
Fucking asshole.

01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.268
93B715.

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:49.769
Menkins?
Yeah.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:53.310
The doctor wants to see you
in the sick call room.

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:54.310
Me?

01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:56.041
Yeah, sick call room.

01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:04.834
What's the deal?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.977
What the...?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.811
That nurse in there is
the only one I trust.

01:14:15.834 --> 01:14:18.291
Why don't you have a seat?
I'm fine how I am.

01:14:19.959 --> 01:14:23.060
No more fucking around, Louis.

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:25.310
We know there's something
coming in from outside,

01:14:25.333 --> 01:14:27.060
and I need to know what and how,

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:29.519
and I'm pretty sure that you
have that information.

01:14:29.542 --> 01:14:30.894
Why would I?

01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:32.310
'Cause you probably talked
to Patrick,

01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:33.477
and Patrick fucking knows
everything.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.977
So fucking talk to Patrick.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.602
Patrick does not talk to us.
Me neither.

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:38.185
Well, then I will extend
your sentence by 20 years

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:40.435
on charges of conspiring
to smuggle contraband,

01:14:40.458 --> 01:14:42.018
and you will die a lonely
fucking death

01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:43.519
within the confines of your cell

01:14:43.542 --> 01:14:45.352
because I can fucking
arrange that.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:47.143
Yeah, I don't think
you can legally do that.

01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:49.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:55.542
Whatever it is that's coming,
just tell me how.

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.018
Is it over the wall?

01:14:58.041 --> 01:15:00.143
Trash truck, laundry,
food, auto body,

01:15:00.166 --> 01:15:01.519
CO, staffer, visitor?

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:04.500
Just tell me where to look.
I got no idea.

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:10.542
Do you not think I'm serious?
I'm sure you are.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:16.060
If Terry Macklin makes that
hit, people are gonna get hurt,

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:18.644
and your wish of not being
on lockdown for your last days

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:19.894
will go right out the window

01:15:19.917 --> 01:15:21.102
because you won't have
any last days.

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:22.560
You will be here forever,

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:24.727
and this place will be
shut down for eight months,

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:27.936
I swear to fucking God.

01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:30.083
Do you, dude.

01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:34.458
Stupid fucking mistake.

01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:37.602
Get me out of here.

01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:33.852
Man, I ain't got time for this.

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.852
Walk in, Louis.

01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:37.500
Louis, go in.

01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:42.602
Louis, go in.

01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:41.602
Hey.

01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:43.310
You ready?

01:17:43.333 --> 01:17:44.977
For what?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.519
You have a meeting

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:49.417
with the restorative justice
committee or something.

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:24.477
Louis, good to see you.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.625
Louis, this is Karen James,
sister of Abraham James.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:35.519
Karen was eager
to meet with you.

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:37.602
Hi, Ms. James.
Hi.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.000
Please.

01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:54.750
It's good
to see you again, Louis.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.519
Anybody want to get started?

01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:03.102
Or maybe talk about how you're
feeling right now.

01:19:03.125 --> 01:19:06.125
Uh, I'll start.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.602
Um...

01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:13.811
the last time I saw you
was in court.

01:19:13.834 --> 01:19:18.102
I had a lot of hatred and anger
toward you,

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:21.227
and I've been wanting
for many of those years since

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:24.185
to find a way to let that go.

01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:26.936
And being here today right now,

01:19:26.959 --> 01:19:30.435
even though some
of those feelings still exist,

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:35.143
I can also say that I am
no longer consumed by them.

01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:37.769
And seeing you, as you are now,

01:19:37.792 --> 01:19:41.644
as a human being is meaningful.

01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:46.041
That's great to hear, Karen.
Thank you, that's great.

01:19:53.291 --> 01:19:57.375
Uh, thank you
for saying that, uh, Ms. James.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:03.227
And I hope you do know
that I very much regret

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:05.727
what I did to your brother.

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:10.018
It seems almost silly now

01:20:10.041 --> 01:20:12.143
to say that
after all these years,

01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:13.852
but it certainly is true.

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:18.644
I was a very dumb kid,
young man,

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:21.583
um, when I did that.

01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:27.852
And I've tried, um, to use
these years here

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:30.519
to learn from it...

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:31.852
uh...

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:35.560
to not be that person...

01:20:35.583 --> 01:20:39.625
um, and to be
a better human being.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:45.143
Thank you, Louis.
That's amazing to hear.

01:20:45.166 --> 01:20:48.560
And how old would
your brother have been today?

01:20:48.583 --> 01:20:51.709
Uh, he would have been
50 years old.

01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:59.060
The night of the robbery,

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:02.477
the night your brother
was killed...

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.875
I just remember him being
a very brave man.

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:12.060
And as you may know, there was
no real beef between us.

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:16.811
It was more the groups
that we were with.

01:21:16.834 --> 01:21:19.727
And I just remember,

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:23.602
uh, him being very brave
in the face of what went down.

01:21:23.625 --> 01:21:25.811
Could you tell me more
about that,

01:21:25.834 --> 01:21:28.602
about what went down?

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:31.333
You... you want me to?
Yes.

01:21:33.166 --> 01:21:36.060
Well, um...

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:37.936
I was supposed to rob him.

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.435
He was carrying cash,

01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:42.291
and I was selected to go get it.

01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:46.268
And when he didn't give it up,

01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:49.227
uh, we started yelling, and...

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:52.602
and he ended up getting shot.

01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:55.435
Why?

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.268
'Cause he didn't do what
I told him to.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:59.894
But why did you shoot him?

01:21:59.917 --> 01:22:02.268
W-why didn't you just hit him

01:22:02.291 --> 01:22:04.435
or even just shoot him
in the foot?

01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.060
Well, he had a...
He had a gun, too, Ms. James.

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:10.811
Still, couldn't you
have just hurt him

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:13.560
instead of kill,

01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:16.667
instead of shooting him
in the head?

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:23.060
So that
his brains just... just...

01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.102
fell on the... I'm sorry.

01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:26.477
It's okay.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.310
I just...

01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:30.977
May I say something else?
Of course.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.435
I don't want you to get out.
I don't think you should.

01:22:34.458 --> 01:22:35.727
And I-I'm so sorry,

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.268
I don't mean this
to be vindictive,

01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:41.977
because I know the law,
and I respect it,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.644
and... and... and... and I would
never try to stop it,

01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:49.102
but I just feel
that I have to say

01:22:49.125 --> 01:22:51.060
that sitting here

01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:55.352
knowing Mr. Menkins
is soon to be released,

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:58.018
I would be lying
if I didn't say out loud

01:22:58.041 --> 01:23:02.352
that I don't believe that
that is the correct decision.

01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:04.644
And... and I respect you.

01:23:04.667 --> 01:23:07.102
And... and I'm sure
that you are truthful

01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:11.185
in saying that you are
a different person.

01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:13.602
But you killed a man.

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:18.602
You shot a man point blank

01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:21.268
in the head,

01:23:21.291 --> 01:23:23.894
in his eyes.

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:26.727
And you tried
to get away with it.

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:29.102
And you would have

01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:33.018
if you own mother hadn't seen
the blood on your pants

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.227
and called the police.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.727
And so I do believe

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:40.727
that you should remain
in prison for that...

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:43.250
for the rest of your life.

01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:59.394
I, um...

01:23:59.417 --> 01:24:01.792
I understand how you feel.

01:24:04.291 --> 01:24:08.959
And there are many days...

01:24:10.542 --> 01:24:13.250
That I've wondered
if you're right.

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:17.417
That...

01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:23.834
Maybe this...

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.834
That this is where I belong.

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:43.018
Open the damn thing, man.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.644
You haven't started
packing up yet?

01:25:51.667 --> 01:25:53.310
You got less than a week.

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:55.143
I ain't got much.
I'll get to it.

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:58.166
Shit, I've seen guys with a
month to go already packed out.

01:26:05.417 --> 01:26:06.686
Hey.

01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:09.227
You were right
about that thing with Terry.

01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:11.917
He said if I don't help him,
I'm dead.

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.602
I stayed up all night thinking.

01:26:14.625 --> 01:26:19.060
It's like all my choices
are bullshit.

01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:22.394
I can't... I can't keep living
like this, Louis.

01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:25.143
What you want me to do?
I don't know.

01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:27.686
Tell that motherfucker no.
Hold your ground.

01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:29.727
He won't mess with you, not if
he know I'm looking after you.

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:31.394
He doesn't give a shit
what you think.

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:32.811
I'm sorry, but he don't.

01:26:32.834 --> 01:26:34.560
And even if he did,
you're about to get out.

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:35.852
Then what?

01:26:35.875 --> 01:26:37.519
I still got to wake up
in this motherfucker

01:26:37.542 --> 01:26:40.102
for the next 20 and deal
with the consequences.

01:26:40.125 --> 01:26:42.394
The road is hard that
leads to life.

01:26:42.417 --> 01:26:44.227
Those that find it are few.

01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:45.727
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:48.394
Sometimes the hard choice,
the right choice.

01:26:48.417 --> 01:26:52.519
So then maybe you can make
a choice.

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:54.268
What do you mean?

01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:56.060
Maybe, like, do it for me.

01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:57.936
What, I take the gun
out the shop,

01:26:57.959 --> 01:26:59.644
so now I'm looking at
a extra 30?

01:26:59.667 --> 01:27:01.435
But you wouldn't.
How you figure?

01:27:01.458 --> 01:27:03.185
No one would suspect you.
You're about to get released.

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:05.268
Terry says I can get away with
it because I'm new,

01:27:05.291 --> 01:27:06.268
but he's lying.

01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:07.936
Now that I'm in auto body,

01:27:07.959 --> 01:27:10.352
I'd be the first one they come
at when the shit go down.

01:27:10.375 --> 01:27:11.769
And like you said, it will.

01:27:11.792 --> 01:27:13.227
No one would suspect you.

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.477
That's the stupidest shit
I ever fucking heard.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.936
Look, it's coming today.

01:27:17.959 --> 01:27:19.936
It's going to be
in the back fender.

01:27:19.959 --> 01:27:21.435
Only thing I need to do
is grab it

01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:24.477
and drop it off by laundry
on my way back.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.352
I don't want to be this dude
no more, Louis.

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:28.143
I can't find my way
out of this shit.

01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:30.166
I need your help.

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.458
All fucking talk.

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:47.310
Oh, here she comes.

01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:50.143
Bring it up.

01:27:50.166 --> 01:27:51.811
Let's take a look.

01:27:57.667 --> 01:27:58.977
Right there.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.644
Hey, not too bad, not too bad.

01:28:00.667 --> 01:28:03.185
Well, got
a little bumper damage,

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:05.477
couple dents here and there.

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.143
Okay, let's bring it in.

01:28:07.166 --> 01:28:10.310
Hey, Larry, why don't you
and, uh, Beech

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:11.686
start on it tomorrow?

01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:14.310
Oh, yeah, we got this.
All right, then.

01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:02.936
What you think?
Can it be done?

01:29:02.959 --> 01:29:07.811
I'll just, uh... get started
on this back bumper.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.143
Lefty loosey, righty tighty.

01:29:50.875 --> 01:29:53.792
Louis, what you looking for?

01:29:55.959 --> 01:29:58.936
Just, uh, feeling for damage.

01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:32.667
Hey.

01:30:36.625 --> 01:30:38.268
Can you grab it for me?

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:39.394
And put it where?

01:30:39.417 --> 01:30:41.310
Put it in your pants
or wherever.

01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:43.560
Doesn't really matter.

01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:46.936
It ain't got to be perfect,
Piner already knows what's up.

01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.936
Louis.
Get out of here, man.

01:30:54.834 --> 01:30:57.477
You gonna do it for me?

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.477
Please!

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.477
Start that tomorrow.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.227
Great work, gentlemen.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:06.667
All right, let's go.
Let's go, wrap it up.

01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:13.519
Hey, Piner! I think we found
something here, man!

01:31:13.542 --> 01:31:15.769
We got a gun, man!
It's a gun!

01:31:15.792 --> 01:31:18.227
We got a gun, man!
We got a gun!

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:20.852
It's a goddamn gun!
Drop the gun!

01:31:29.125 --> 01:31:31.268
I need backup in auto body
right now!

01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:34.310
Get away from the truck!
Roll, roll your body!

01:31:34.333 --> 01:31:36.686
Put your faces to the ground!

01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:06.727
No!

01:35:12.125 --> 01:35:14.560
Get your hand off...
Get your hand off me.

01:35:19.083 --> 01:35:20.727
What?

01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:23.060
Pass it back, pass it back.
Let's go.

01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:25.310
Appreciate that.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:29.000
Uh-oh.
On your left. Hi-yah!

01:35:30.375 --> 01:35:32.811
Got it.

01:35:32.834 --> 01:35:35.602
I may be old...

01:35:46.125 --> 01:35:48.435
Shoot the damn ball.

01:36:16.291 --> 01:36:18.102
Put this on. Let's go.

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:48.227
You live out there, Louis.
You live out there for me, man.

01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:49.560
I got you, Beans.

01:37:57.625 --> 01:38:01.310
Moving offender Menkins to 5-10.

01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:03.000
This is it.

01:38:13.959 --> 01:38:15.227
What is it?

01:38:15.250 --> 01:38:19.268
A check for $853.30.

01:38:19.291 --> 01:38:20.644
Do you need street clothes?

01:38:20.667 --> 01:38:23.602
Uh, yeah, I can't really
wear these.

01:38:23.625 --> 01:38:25.977
Do you know your sizes?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.185
No.

01:38:27.208 --> 01:38:28.959
All right, wait here.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.727
What's up, Louis?

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.811
Leaving.

01:39:20.834 --> 01:39:23.602
Yeah, I heard.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.977
Yeah, they went to find me
some clothes.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.083
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah.

01:39:34.208 --> 01:39:36.102
I'm sad to see you go.

01:39:36.125 --> 01:39:39.185
Yeah, thanks.

01:39:39.208 --> 01:39:41.917
Yeah, you always were
a pretty good friend.

01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:44.352
No, I wasn't.

01:39:44.375 --> 01:39:47.375
True.

01:39:52.834 --> 01:39:56.000
So, um...

01:39:58.875 --> 01:40:00.852
What actually happened
in auto body?

01:40:00.875 --> 01:40:03.310
Oh, uh, like I told you,

01:40:03.333 --> 01:40:05.352
I heard a rumor about a gun
in the car,

01:40:05.375 --> 01:40:07.477
and, uh,
thought I'd take a look.

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.018
And you're saying that... that
Beecher saw you looking in

01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:13.185
in that car bumper
and then just figured

01:40:13.208 --> 01:40:14.477
that he had to have a look, too?

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:15.811
Yeah.
But that he didn't know

01:40:15.834 --> 01:40:17.519
anything
about the gun before that.

01:40:17.542 --> 01:40:18.686
That's right.

01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:20.227
You're so full of shit, Louis.

01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:23.519
Yeah, I can understand.
That's complicated stuff.

01:40:23.542 --> 01:40:26.060
Not really.
Hmm.

01:40:26.083 --> 01:40:27.291
Here you go.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.583
Thanks.

01:40:36.458 --> 01:40:38.560
So what, I just change
right here?

01:40:38.583 --> 01:40:40.792
Yeah, might as well.

01:40:54.625 --> 01:40:56.352
Sister's picking you up?

01:40:56.375 --> 01:40:58.333
That's what they told me.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.102
What time?

01:41:02.125 --> 01:41:04.125
Uh, 10:00.

01:41:15.625 --> 01:41:17.268
I should get back.

01:41:17.291 --> 01:41:20.291
I got to deal with all
the nut jobs.

01:41:21.959 --> 01:41:23.500
All right, Louis.

01:41:34.333 --> 01:41:37.709
Don't stay in touch.
Don't plan to.

01:42:47.333 --> 01:42:49.185
All right, we'll buzz you
through the gate,

01:42:49.208 --> 01:42:50.811
and then you're free to go.

01:42:50.834 --> 01:42:53.435
That's it?
That's it.

01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:54.894

01:48:48.417 --> 01:48:50.041
knowing that I was a murderer?"

01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:54.834
I feel like
if I was to share my story,

01:48:55.041 --> 01:48:58.458
would this prevent somebody else
from committing violence?

01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:03.894
Tell me a little bit
about your childhood?

01:49:03.917 --> 01:49:05.394
The streets was presented to me

01:49:05.417 --> 01:49:07.686
at a young age
before I even knew myself.

01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:09.852
We lived in a raggedy trailer

01:49:09.875 --> 01:49:10.936
on a mountainside.

01:49:10.959 --> 01:49:12.727
One day, at the gas station...

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.041
I had left my foster home...

01:49:14.291 --> 01:49:16.268
My dad said, "Let's
go over to the neighborhood."

01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:18.894
It's one of them
things that is unraveled.

01:49:18.917 --> 01:49:20.500
There's no turning back
the clock.

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:23.500
How much time did the judge
give you?

01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:24.834
Oh, 45 years.

01:49:27.458 --> 01:49:29.143
All of us come
from different places,

01:49:29.166 --> 01:49:30.458
but our stories are so similar.

01:49:30.959 --> 01:49:32.375
I want people
to see this and be like,

01:49:32.583 --> 01:49:34.519
"They needed some help
at one point in time,

01:49:34.542 --> 01:49:36.727
and they didn't get it
and look what happened to them."

01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:38.560
I don't want us
getting into making this feel

01:49:38.583 --> 01:49:40.227
like a sympathy type of thing.

01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:43.959
Let's also tell the other story
of I chose to kill you.

01:49:45.166 --> 01:49:47.727
Do you think your mentality
could have got put back

01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:48.583
on the right track?

01:49:48.792 --> 01:49:50.709
I think it was plenty
of opportunities.

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.977
We just couldn't get it
back then. We were just livin'.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.083
Now we do get it.

01:49:55.667 --> 01:49:57.166
It's a hard truth, ain't it?

01:49:58.305 --> 01:50:04.500
