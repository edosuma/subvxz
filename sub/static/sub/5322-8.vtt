00:07.955 --> 00:10.448
Sofia, it's Friday night!

00:10.449 --> 00:11.617
Yeah, it is!

00:11.618 --> 00:13.653
We're not gonna sleep
till the sun comes up!

00:13.654 --> 00:15.389
You're damn right we're not!

00:16.416 --> 00:19.052
Both: Aren't you gonna
change? Why would I change?

00:19.052 --> 00:20.587
We're going out clubbing tonight.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.706
No, we're not. We're
finishing Breaking Bad tonight.

00:22.707 --> 00:25.237
You know what's breaking
bad? Your dating life.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.129
What are you talking about?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.172
I date.

00:29.173 --> 00:31.954
You've been on three dates in the past year
and you found a reason to hate all of them.

00:32.093 --> 00:33.228
That's not true!

00:34.309 --> 00:35.871
You remember Mr. Brilliant?

00:35.872 --> 00:37.174
How could I forget?

00:37.505 --> 00:39.160
(Snooty accent) "The traffic is brilliant.

00:39.161 --> 00:41.062
"The lighting was brilliant.

00:41.797 --> 00:43.953
"These ice cubes are brilliant."

00:44.955 --> 00:46.507
Okay, well, then you didn't like Rick

00:46.507 --> 00:48.699
because he dotted his I's with a bubble.

00:49.256 --> 00:50.955
And he had a flip phone.

00:50.956 --> 00:52.199
What are we, cavemen?

00:52.906 --> 00:54.441
Okay, listen...

00:54.442 --> 00:57.113
Sweetie, did you ever think maybe
you're just a little too picky?

00:57.456 --> 00:58.399
No!

00:58.400 --> 01:00.086
Look, you just don't get it,

01:00.086 --> 01:02.455
because you have a super Cooper bear.

01:02.455 --> 01:03.924
Yeah, and that's why
I'm pushing you so hard.

01:03.924 --> 01:07.394
I want you to have a super
significant other bear.

01:08.282 --> 01:09.929
Well, it ain't gonna happen,

01:09.930 --> 01:11.831
because all the perfect guys are taken.

01:11.831 --> 01:13.340
I met the perfect guy!

01:13.341 --> 01:15.335
- (Gasps)

01:15.335 --> 01:16.372
Marco!

01:16.441 --> 01:17.372
Polo!

01:17.373 --> 01:19.191
Where'd you meet him? The pool?

01:21.179 --> 01:23.515
In the pool of hotties on "HeyCupid."

01:23.515 --> 01:25.050
It's a dating app

01:25.050 --> 01:26.284
where you hold your phone up

01:26.284 --> 01:28.887
and if a guy nearby likes your profile,

01:28.887 --> 01:29.921
bam!

01:29.921 --> 01:31.156
(Giggles)

01:31.156 --> 01:32.524
Now I have Marco.

01:32.524 --> 01:36.524
He's cool, sexy, and owns
a gourmet butcher shop.

01:36.711 --> 01:38.296
Oh, wow!

01:38.296 --> 01:40.098
Sofia hasn't had a good
piece of meat in a while.

01:43.443 --> 01:44.511
So, uh,

01:44.512 --> 01:45.873
we're going on our second date tonight,

01:45.874 --> 01:48.116
so I just came to pick up some mo' wine.

01:48.911 --> 01:50.051
- (Timer dings)
- Oh!

01:50.052 --> 01:51.721
And whatever might be in your oven.

01:52.712 --> 01:53.980
Whoo!

01:53.980 --> 01:58.051
Girl, I am so glad I moved next door.

02:01.587 --> 02:02.524
Sofia...

02:02.525 --> 02:03.659
don't even say it.

02:03.660 --> 02:04.928
I'm not using that app.

02:05.024 --> 02:07.526
Men of the world, you've had your chance.

02:07.526 --> 02:10.295
My ass might not quit, but I do.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.634
Yeah, well, luckily I don't.

02:14.634 --> 02:18.237
"HeyCupid," meet Sofia Maria
Consuelo Rafeala Rodriguez.

I need you to press pause on your pathetic
little life and help me hide Josh's stuff.

02:48.294 --> 02:50.663
Caroline just announced her engagement.

02:50.907 --> 02:51.701
What?

02:51.702 --> 02:53.513
But she and Josh broke
up, like, two months ago.

02:53.514 --> 02:54.293
I thought she'd be too busy

02:54.293 --> 02:56.095
making coats out of dalmatian puppies

02:56.095 --> 02:57.129
to get married again.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.367
Wait, does Josh know?

03:00.266 --> 03:02.101
Why do you think I'm hiding his laptop

03:02.101 --> 03:03.135
his smartphone...

03:04.370 --> 03:06.038
And whatever this vibrating thing is?

03:09.609 --> 03:11.477
Yolanda just told me Caroline's engaged?

03:11.477 --> 03:12.478
Damn it!

03:14.008 --> 03:15.314
Listen, Josh,

03:15.314 --> 03:17.249
just because Caroline
is engaged doesn't mean

03:17.249 --> 03:18.463
you need to go start feeling

03:18.464 --> 03:20.252
- all bad about yourself.
- I don't.

03:20.252 --> 03:23.022
You know, like, "Am I not charming enough?

03:23.022 --> 03:24.689
"Am I not funny enough? Am I getting fat?"

03:24.690 --> 03:25.625
Gabi.

03:26.959 --> 03:28.227
Just for the record, Josh,

03:28.228 --> 03:30.449
I'd love you even if you did get fat.

03:32.031 --> 03:33.232
Guys,

03:33.232 --> 03:34.567
I'm happy for Caroline.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.522
We weren't meant to be
together. It's all good.

03:36.523 --> 03:39.479
You don't need to be brave for us, big guy.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.141
Bring it in.

03:44.176 --> 03:45.458
I don't need to go in.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.461
I'm good.

03:50.446 --> 03:51.608
Can I tell you a secret?

03:51.609 --> 03:52.385
What?

03:52.385 --> 03:54.882
If he got fat, wouldn't love him.

04:00.593 --> 04:01.627
(Phone chimes)

04:01.627 --> 04:03.491
Oh, Elliot, can you grab my phone?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.336
I'm elbow-deep in dumplings.

04:06.265 --> 04:08.167
I'm elbow-deep in "I don't care."

04:09.335 --> 04:10.652
(Scoffs) Please,

04:10.653 --> 04:12.222
I made Sofia a fake dating profile

04:12.223 --> 04:14.006
and every time it dings,
it means she got a match.

04:14.006 --> 04:15.041
Don't you want to see?

04:15.041 --> 04:16.375
Are the guys shirtless?

04:18.277 --> 04:19.310
No.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.346
Then no.

04:20.346 --> 04:21.180
(Phone chimes)

04:21.180 --> 04:22.692
Shoot. Uh...

04:24.350 --> 04:26.218
Ooh, Ruben.

04:26.218 --> 04:28.020
Let's see, college graduate,

04:28.020 --> 04:29.255
works in marketing,

04:29.255 --> 04:30.898
five foot...

04:31.290 --> 04:33.259
Eleven! (Gasps)

04:33.259 --> 04:36.362
Oh! Elliot, it looks like we have a match.

04:36.362 --> 04:37.630
Did you know, statistically,

04:37.630 --> 04:39.687
cellphones are dirtier than toilet seats?

04:41.634 --> 04:42.668
I did not.

04:42.668 --> 04:44.236
Excuse me, I'll be in the bathroom,

04:44.236 --> 04:45.479
scrubbing my face till I bleed.

04:47.907 --> 04:49.375
What do you think?

04:49.375 --> 04:50.943
Marco's taking me to lunch,

04:50.943 --> 04:52.244
and I'm trying to look young.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.635
Is he picking you up 20 years ago?

04:56.717 --> 04:58.119
I'm gonna go touch-up my makeup.

04:58.119 --> 04:59.754
Josh's paint roller is in the laundry room.

05:00.755 --> 05:01.756
(Doorbell rings)

05:09.096 --> 05:10.932
Hi, I'm here to...

05:12.648 --> 05:13.504
Elliot?

05:13.505 --> 05:14.683
Marco?

05:14.683 --> 05:15.918
(Gasps)

05:15.918 --> 05:17.904
You're the Marco that's
going out with Yolanda?

05:18.954 --> 05:20.647
But you used to date men,

05:20.648 --> 05:22.624
and by men, I mean me.

05:24.785 --> 05:26.653
Okay, this just got a little weird.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.923
I haven't seen you since
the Madonna concert.

05:29.923 --> 05:32.492
That was a terrible place to dump me.

05:33.798 --> 05:35.996
I haven't been able to
listen to her music since.

05:37.217 --> 05:38.699
Honey, no one has.

05:40.357 --> 05:41.225
Oh, Elliot,

05:41.226 --> 05:43.256
I see you've already met Marco.

05:43.257 --> 05:44.915
Yes, we just met.

05:44.916 --> 05:46.317
Just now.

05:46.496 --> 05:48.531
Not at Brad's Tony Awards party.

05:50.367 --> 05:52.168
Well, let's go, baby.

05:52.925 --> 05:56.239
Marco, are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable using the back door?

05:59.588 --> 06:00.623
So...

06:00.624 --> 06:02.110
What are we thinking for lunch, babe?

06:02.111 --> 06:03.817
Thai? Italian?

06:03.818 --> 06:04.773
(Both giggle)

06:04.774 --> 06:06.292
Why don't you try Korean?

06:08.996 --> 06:10.164
Oh, wait.

06:10.165 --> 06:11.733
You have.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.968
Ruben, this is not a big deal.

06:17.968 --> 06:19.803
Okay? You've just got to tell Sofia

06:19.803 --> 06:22.038
that you're a friend
of my boyfriend, Cooper.

06:22.038 --> 06:23.607
How tight am I with this Cooper?

06:23.607 --> 06:25.509
I mean, do we have
nicknames for each other?

06:25.509 --> 06:27.010
Would the guy give me a kidney?

06:27.010 --> 06:28.245
Why? Why do you need a kidney?

06:28.245 --> 06:29.495
That was not in your profile.

06:29.496 --> 06:31.813
Look, look, I think your
roommate is really cute,

06:31.814 --> 06:34.520
- but I'm just not comfortable lying.
- (Gasps) Sofia!

06:34.580 --> 06:36.515
And suddenly, I'm comfortable.

06:36.853 --> 06:37.412
Wow,

06:37.531 --> 06:39.200
you're even prettier than your picture...

06:39.201 --> 06:41.871
That, ah, Coop showed me at work

06:41.872 --> 06:43.406
where I don't need a kidney.

06:43.407 --> 06:45.318
O... kay. So you're in tech.

06:45.424 --> 06:46.905
Tech... nology?

06:46.906 --> 06:49.712
He was, but now he's not.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.781
Yeah, I had a career change.

06:51.782 --> 06:54.162
I work for an establishment
that makes sandwiches.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.931
It's called Sammich's.

06:56.106 --> 06:57.119
You heard of it?

06:57.120 --> 06:59.055
Fast food, yes.

06:59.138 --> 07:01.134
Have you ever heard of
someone having to leave

07:01.135 --> 07:03.272
a date early because
she has an appointment?

07:03.360 --> 07:04.322
This is that.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.047
Sofia.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.060
I cover five of their franchises
as a marketing associate.

07:08.378 --> 07:09.859
I can reschedule.

07:10.581 --> 07:11.882
Yeah, you can.

07:12.282 --> 07:14.718
You know, Coopster told me you were smart,

07:14.718 --> 07:16.186
funny, and gorgeous.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.721
If you ask me,

07:17.721 --> 07:19.590
he under-promised
and over-delivered.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.291

07:21.291 --> 07:22.726
Marketing speak.

07:22.726 --> 07:24.661
Gabi, I just remembered
that you have to leave early

07:24.661 --> 07:25.762
because you have an appointment.

07:25.762 --> 07:26.597
- No, I don't.
- You do!

07:26.597 --> 07:27.598
Okay.

07:33.937 --> 07:36.306
Good morning, my beautiful best friend.

07:37.049 --> 07:39.698
Well, "good morning" before coffee?

07:39.699 --> 07:42.424
It looks like somebody has a roommate
that found her the perfect guy!

07:42.425 --> 07:44.433
Shh! He's in there right now.

07:44.434 --> 07:45.468
(Gasps) Wow.

07:45.469 --> 07:46.377
Damn, girl.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.995
Way to make up for lost time.

07:47.996 --> 07:49.358
Was it like riding a bicycle

07:49.359 --> 07:52.264
or was it like riding a
bicycle a whole bunch of times?

07:54.196 --> 07:56.231
No, all we did was talk.

07:56.231 --> 07:57.933
Naked?

07:57.933 --> 08:00.235
No, you know I'm old fashioned.

08:00.235 --> 08:02.805
Booty's gotta wait till
at least the seventh date.

08:02.805 --> 08:06.075
Ugh, but he is so amazing

08:06.075 --> 08:08.377
and sweet and ambitious.

08:08.378 --> 08:10.515
Plus, I did a background
check while he was sleeping.

08:10.603 --> 08:11.871
No priors.

08:12.147 --> 08:15.284
Oh, wow. No urine sample? You're slipping.

08:15.907 --> 08:17.242
Well, anyway, I'm gonna shower

08:17.243 --> 08:18.908
because he says he has to leave for work,

08:18.909 --> 08:20.602
where he wears a suit.

08:20.603 --> 08:22.472
I'm finally dating a guy who wears a suit!

08:24.539 --> 08:26.507
♪ Go Gabi, go Gabi. ♪

08:29.745 --> 08:30.746
Hey, Ruben.

08:30.746 --> 08:31.780
Hey!

08:31.780 --> 08:32.815
I thought you left for work.

08:34.717 --> 08:35.784
I did not.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.886
Your turn.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.956
(Chuckles) You mean this?

08:42.039 --> 08:43.140
I wear this for work.

08:43.359 --> 08:44.960
Sofia said you wore a suit to work.

08:45.641 --> 08:46.676
I do.

08:46.677 --> 08:48.412
A ham and cheese sandwich suit.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.804
(Laughs) What?

08:50.804 --> 08:52.706
(Angrily) I mean, what?

08:52.706 --> 08:54.641
You know, for Sammich's.

08:54.641 --> 08:56.928
I'm Sammy the sammich.

08:56.929 --> 08:58.479
My costume's in the car.

08:59.260 --> 09:01.896
Oh my God, I-I set Sofia
up with a sandwich but...

09:01.896 --> 09:03.798
wait, you said you were in marketing.

09:03.798 --> 09:06.200
Well, people see me dance,
and they buy a sandwich...

09:06.200 --> 09:07.389
marketing.

09:07.433 --> 09:08.558
Oh my God.

09:08.559 --> 09:10.908
This is so much worse
than having a flip phone.

09:11.947 --> 09:13.915
That's why I don't tell
girls on the first date.

09:13.916 --> 09:15.258
They can be a little judgy.

09:15.939 --> 09:17.931
Yeah, well, you are a sammich.

09:19.483 --> 09:22.686
And if Sofia finds out, she is
never gonna go out with you again.

09:22.686 --> 09:24.822
(Sighs) I really like her.

09:24.822 --> 09:26.890
I know, and I'm her best friend,

09:26.890 --> 09:28.541
and I want to continue to be,

09:28.542 --> 09:30.504
so you just can't tell her.

09:30.505 --> 09:32.202
Okay? Promise me.

09:32.203 --> 09:34.023
- Okay, yeah.
- All right, shake on it!

09:38.435 --> 09:39.703
Oh God, what have I done?

09:44.721 --> 09:45.789
(Phone chimes)

09:45.789 --> 09:48.358
Oh, man. I've gotta delete this app.

09:48.358 --> 09:50.994
Setting up Sofia was the
worst idea I've ever had.

09:50.994 --> 09:52.195
How would you know?

09:52.195 --> 09:54.197
Don't you need to have a
good idea to compare it to?

09:54.522 --> 09:56.065
You know what? It's fine.

09:56.066 --> 09:58.247
It'll be okay. She'll find
something about him that she hates,

09:58.248 --> 09:59.634
and then she'll dump
him before she finds out

09:59.635 --> 10:01.257
he's a sandwich and dumps me.

10:02.523 --> 10:04.024
Ugh, Gabi!

10:04.025 --> 10:06.176
Enough with the incessant whining.

10:08.052 --> 10:09.353
(Whining) Josh!

10:09.354 --> 10:10.956
I have a problem.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.956
Now is not a good time, Elliot.

10:13.256 --> 10:16.010
Yolanda's dating someone I
used to date. Should I tell her?

10:16.029 --> 10:16.813
Yes.

10:18.948 --> 10:20.871
I was hoping you'd go the other way...

10:21.180 --> 10:23.149
Like Marco used to.

10:24.987 --> 10:28.791
Listen, I may have a little
bit of a situation, too.

10:28.791 --> 10:29.909
Whatever it is,

10:29.910 --> 10:32.760
don't do something in the heat of
the moment that you'll regret forever.

10:33.156 --> 10:34.891
That's all I do. Do you know me?

10:36.433 --> 10:37.383
Are you okay?

10:37.384 --> 10:38.518
I'm fine. No, I'm not.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.382
So I was thinking about
how happy I am for Caroline,

10:41.382 --> 10:43.758
so I went over to her place
and gave her a wedding gift.

10:43.759 --> 10:45.252
Oh, that's sweet. What'd you give her?

10:45.252 --> 10:46.287
An orgasm.

10:46.287 --> 10:47.288
What?

10:48.422 --> 10:49.740
We had sex.

10:49.740 --> 10:51.083
Y...

10:51.084 --> 10:52.953
yes, I know what an orgasm is!

10:52.954 --> 10:54.856
I just didn't know that
you could register for one.

10:54.857 --> 10:56.292
Oh! Ugh!

10:56.401 --> 10:58.929
Oh my God, what is going on with me?

10:58.930 --> 11:00.574
I mean, since I broke up
with Caroline, there's been

11:00.575 --> 11:03.300
Jilly, Lauren, Shauna,
almost Shauna's daughter,

11:03.471 --> 11:04.538
and now back to Caroline.

11:05.656 --> 11:06.958
You lapped yourself.

11:07.577 --> 11:08.728
I know.

11:08.729 --> 11:12.421
High school Josh would have been stoked
to be in this position, but this is not me.

11:12.879 --> 11:14.147
You know what?

11:14.460 --> 11:17.418
I am not sleeping with any more women
until I figure out what is going on.

11:17.906 --> 11:19.187
Listen,

11:19.274 --> 11:21.299
you're not the only one who's
been messing up recently.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.749
I, uh, (Clears throat)

11:22.750 --> 11:25.014
I accidentally set
Sofia up with a sandwich.

11:28.098 --> 11:29.627
I see what you're doing, Gabi.

11:29.628 --> 11:31.630
You're making up something
more idiotic than what I did

11:31.631 --> 11:33.590
to help me feel better
about myself. Thank you.

11:35.812 --> 11:37.347
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

11:45.134 --> 11:46.502
Yolanda!

11:46.502 --> 11:48.071
I have to tell you something!

11:48.071 --> 11:49.514
Well, tell me while I vacuum,

11:49.515 --> 11:52.242
I have to hurry for my date with Marco!

11:52.242 --> 11:53.610
About that,

11:53.610 --> 11:55.245
I used to date him!

11:55.245 --> 11:56.546
(Shouting) What?

11:56.546 --> 11:59.382
I used to date Marco!

12:02.917 --> 12:04.485
What the hell you talkin' about?

12:06.232 --> 12:08.201
Marco likes women.

12:08.202 --> 12:09.369
Now.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.959
I don't believe you.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.846
Shark tattoo right between the...

12:14.847 --> 12:15.848
Oh my damn!

12:18.415 --> 12:19.696
I'm sorry.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.785
Marco must have been experimenting,

12:21.785 --> 12:23.390
and I was his laboratory.

12:26.231 --> 12:27.874
I can't believe I'm saying this,

12:27.875 --> 12:29.901
but I don't want you to get hurt.

12:29.901 --> 12:32.237
'Cause even though Marco went straight,

12:32.237 --> 12:34.172
he still might fluctuate.

12:34.811 --> 12:38.311
Oh, that is so sweet, Elliot.

12:38.901 --> 12:40.269
But let's be real.

12:40.270 --> 12:43.773
He went "gaysian," then
changed his persuasion.

12:50.908 --> 12:53.044
Oh, hey, I had a thought about Ruben.

12:53.044 --> 12:56.661
Oh, you noticed he chews weird,
and you kicked him to the curb?

12:58.282 --> 12:59.784
He chews perfectly.

12:59.784 --> 13:00.785
Finally!

13:01.786 --> 13:03.321
Hey, listen, the point is

13:03.321 --> 13:05.123
uh, you got your groove back.

13:05.123 --> 13:08.292
You know, so now you can get out there
and you can date other people, not Ruben.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.395
Are you crazy?

13:10.395 --> 13:12.030
I finally meet a guy I like,

13:12.030 --> 13:15.571
that's why I'm breaking the
seven-date rule on having sex tonight.

13:15.572 --> 13:16.834
No! No, no, no. Don't.

13:17.969 --> 13:18.970
Put that away!

13:20.371 --> 13:22.440
The rule is very clear, okay?

13:22.440 --> 13:24.553
Booty's gotta wait until
you find things you hate.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.156
Okay, what is going on?

13:26.156 --> 13:27.257
Because a couple of days ago,

13:27.257 --> 13:28.625
you couldn't wait for me to meet someone.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.793
And now you want me to dump him?

13:31.027 --> 13:32.095
Okay, sit down.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.873
There's something about
Ruben you should know.

13:34.874 --> 13:35.691
Okay, well tell me.

13:35.692 --> 13:37.779
Because I think he's the perfect man.

13:37.855 --> 13:39.311
Not so much of a man...

13:42.138 --> 13:43.640
As a manwich.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.728
What?

13:47.477 --> 13:49.646
(Sighs) Ruben...

13:49.646 --> 13:51.248
Is a sandwich.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.789
Yes, Gabi. Haha!

13:54.790 --> 13:56.664
I'm sure he's never heard that one before.

13:56.761 --> 14:00.064
No, no, no. No! Listen, my point is

14:00.065 --> 14:02.300
Ruben is a sandwich,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.069
a professional sandwich.

14:05.537 --> 14:07.105
Ruben is Sammy the sammich.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.442
Hold on.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.398
You mean, the one that
stands outside the...

14:12.399 --> 14:13.433
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- With the...

14:13.434 --> 14:14.602
- Who does the...
- Yeah.

14:14.713 --> 14:16.081
- What the...
- Go!

14:18.767 --> 14:20.971
I don't understand. Why can't
you just break up with him

14:20.972 --> 14:22.506
over text like all the other ones?

14:22.555 --> 14:23.923
Because he lied to me.

14:24.055 --> 14:26.291
I almost had a one-night "standwich."

14:27.014 --> 14:28.048
Here he is.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.181
Hey!

14:32.789 --> 14:33.890
Why didn't you tell me?

14:33.890 --> 14:35.488
I mean, we-we stayed up all night talking.

14:35.489 --> 14:37.293
We shared intimate details of our lives.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.430
I know your favorite sandwich!

14:38.431 --> 14:41.000
But you forgot to mention that you are one!

14:41.357 --> 14:42.841
- (Gasps) Hey!
- Gabi: Hey, hey!

14:42.842 --> 14:43.947
Don't push me!

14:43.948 --> 14:45.683
Nobody shoves my best friend.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.619
Come here! (Grunting)

14:47.620 --> 14:48.721
(Grunts)

14:48.722 --> 14:50.691
- (Gabi groans)
- (Sofia screams)

14:50.692 --> 14:52.127
You got to apologize!

14:52.148 --> 14:53.883
(Gabi and Sofia gasp)

14:54.996 --> 14:56.231
You're not Ruben.

14:56.232 --> 14:57.500
You're damn right I'm not.

14:57.501 --> 14:58.735
(Gasps)

14:58.736 --> 15:01.239
Uh, five second rule. I'm so sorry!

15:01.866 --> 15:03.167
(Gabi and Sofia grunting)

15:03.168 --> 15:04.103
I'm so sorry.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.273
Sofia? What are you doing here?

15:06.274 --> 15:08.476
Oh my God. The gloves.

15:09.330 --> 15:10.965
You are a sandwich!

15:10.966 --> 15:12.100
I was gonna tell you,

15:12.101 --> 15:13.503
but Gabi made me swear not to.

15:13.504 --> 15:15.105
What?

15:15.106 --> 15:16.708
All right, you can't pin this all on me.

15:16.709 --> 15:19.378
This never would have happened if you
didn't lie to me on your HeyCupid profile.

15:19.611 --> 15:22.214
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back it up, sista.

15:23.494 --> 15:24.929
Profile?

15:24.930 --> 15:26.745
I thought you said he
was a friend of Cooper's.

15:27.328 --> 15:28.729
Uh...

15:28.730 --> 15:31.497
Okay. Listen, I'm-I'm just
gonna come clean. Okay?

15:32.521 --> 15:33.789
Cooper went on HeyCupid...

15:33.789 --> 15:36.258
- Gabi.
- I'm sorry.

15:36.258 --> 15:37.993
I set you up with a fake dating profile,

15:37.993 --> 15:39.962
'cause I wanted you to
find the perfect guy.

15:39.962 --> 15:41.029
Oh my God.

15:41.029 --> 15:43.465
You know, this is too much...

15:43.465 --> 15:44.866
Even for you.

15:47.070 --> 15:48.915
You're lucky this doesn't
have a middle finger!

15:48.916 --> 15:49.852
(Gasps)

15:51.253 --> 15:53.077
Everyone's talking about this place.

15:53.078 --> 15:53.950
(Both chuckle)

15:53.951 --> 15:55.906
And the food looks good.

15:56.037 --> 15:59.207
Oh, the porterhouse steak sounds awesome.

15:59.207 --> 16:02.577
Oh, but the Chinese
chicken salad looks delish!

16:04.379 --> 16:06.147
So you can go either way, huh?

16:06.147 --> 16:07.148
I sure can.

16:08.483 --> 16:10.318
I think I'll have the salad.

16:10.318 --> 16:12.020
I love an Asian dressing.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.042
(Giggles)

16:13.043 --> 16:14.511
And undressing.

16:16.211 --> 16:17.240
(Forced chuckle)

16:17.241 --> 16:18.809
Bop, bop, bop.

16:20.642 --> 16:22.192
(Marco's voice) Let's hurry and order.

16:22.193 --> 16:23.517
The sooner we eat,

16:23.518 --> 16:25.921
the sooner we can burn off these calories.

16:26.284 --> 16:27.785
Oh, hell no, Elliot!

16:28.818 --> 16:29.817
Elliot?

16:30.103 --> 16:31.241
Oh.

16:31.586 --> 16:33.548
I see what this is about.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.082
He told you we used to date

16:35.083 --> 16:37.152
and it freaks you out
that I've been with men.

16:37.203 --> 16:39.240
Oh, no, no.

16:39.241 --> 16:41.944
I-I'm cool with that. I mean,
whatever floats your boat.

16:42.484 --> 16:44.185
But Elliot?

16:44.185 --> 16:47.255
Let's leave the past in the past.

16:47.255 --> 16:51.307
Tonight is just you and me.

16:51.308 --> 16:53.163
(Giggles) Oh, you're right.

16:53.164 --> 16:54.599
I'm being silly.

16:55.393 --> 16:57.094
Mmm.

16:57.457 --> 16:58.269
Ah!

16:58.923 --> 16:59.924
I can't.

16:59.924 --> 17:01.926
I'm sorry, Elliot... I mean, Marco...

17:01.926 --> 17:04.162
El Marco. Bye!

17:08.009 --> 17:10.678
This whole Caroline thing just
really screwed with my head.

17:10.678 --> 17:12.284
I need to work out some frustration.

17:12.285 --> 17:14.487
Couldn't you just drink, like my dad?

17:14.506 --> 17:16.675
I mean, it was so stupid.

17:16.675 --> 17:18.578
I don't even have feelings for her anymore.

17:18.748 --> 17:20.082
It meant nothing.

17:20.083 --> 17:20.934
Ouch!

17:20.935 --> 17:22.709
Yeah, I know. It sounds
harsh, but it's true.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.646
She was never right for me.
None of these girls were.

17:24.647 --> 17:26.349
Why do I keep hooking
up with all these women?

17:26.351 --> 17:28.353
(Panting) Okay, you need to stop.

17:28.354 --> 17:30.523
I wish I could, Elliot. I wish I could.

17:30.524 --> 17:31.858
(Groans) It hurts!

17:31.859 --> 17:36.010
You're damn right, it does, but maybe
I bury this pain by sleeping around.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.079
Why are you doing this?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.949
Maybe because I want that feeling, Elliot.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.085
The feeling you get when
you're excited about somebody,

17:41.086 --> 17:42.221
when you can't get enough of them.

17:42.222 --> 17:43.597
When all you do is think about them...

17:43.598 --> 17:44.784
The way I feel about Gabi.

17:44.953 --> 17:46.096
- Gabi?
- Oof!

17:48.224 --> 17:49.726
Oh my God, that's it.

17:50.902 --> 17:52.158
I still have feelings for Gabi.

17:53.178 --> 17:54.212
(Sighs)

17:54.387 --> 17:55.588
Now what?

17:56.207 --> 17:57.675
Call 911.

18:03.776 --> 18:06.178
Even though I am eating
this sundae you made

18:06.178 --> 18:08.180
to buy back my friendship,

18:08.180 --> 18:10.182
it does not mean that I have forgiven you.

18:10.182 --> 18:12.718
Sofia, I noticed that you are

18:12.718 --> 18:15.721
picking out and not eating the almonds.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.590
(Clears throat) Let me
stop you right there.

18:19.125 --> 18:20.759
I know what you're doing.

18:20.759 --> 18:22.828
You put almonds in my sundae,

18:22.828 --> 18:24.630
knowing that I do not like them,

18:24.630 --> 18:26.732
because even though the
sundae's not perfect,

18:26.732 --> 18:28.100
I'll love it anyway.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.803
Oh, did you pick up on that?

18:30.803 --> 18:33.604
And it's not gonna work
because a sundae isn't a person,

18:33.605 --> 18:36.841
unless you're planning to set me up
with a person who dresses like a sundae.

18:37.973 --> 18:40.541
Let me ask you something.
Who's the biggest disaster

18:40.542 --> 18:41.617
you've ever met in your whole life?

18:41.618 --> 18:42.619
You.

18:43.529 --> 18:45.368
Okay, first off, you
answered that too fast.

18:45.942 --> 18:47.617
And second,

18:47.848 --> 18:49.439
despite what happened today,

18:49.439 --> 18:50.473
do you love me?

18:51.541 --> 18:53.243
(Sighs) Of course I do.

18:53.243 --> 18:55.893
Well, then why is it you
can accept all of my flaws

18:55.894 --> 18:58.625
and still love me, but you can't
do that with the guys that you date?

18:58.757 --> 18:59.775
I don't know.

18:59.776 --> 19:02.332
It's j... it's just different with guys.

19:02.452 --> 19:04.287
Oh, is it?

19:05.522 --> 19:07.858
Yes, I mean, they're...

19:07.858 --> 19:09.526
They're like...

19:09.526 --> 19:11.294
They do... (Sighs)

19:12.662 --> 19:14.397
Wow, that's a really good point.

19:15.498 --> 19:17.601
Well, let me ask you another question.

19:17.601 --> 19:20.303
Would you still love
me if I was a sandwich?

19:21.671 --> 19:23.473
Oh my God.

19:27.152 --> 19:28.645
My plan has worked.

19:35.552 --> 19:36.653
Ruben!

Oh!

19:52.469 --> 19:54.871
I am... I am so, so sorry!

19:54.871 --> 19:56.740
I really like you,

19:56.740 --> 19:59.209
and I don't care if you're a sandwich.

19:59.209 --> 20:01.478
We just won't tell my parents.

20:01.478 --> 20:03.079
Oh, please tell me I have the right one.

20:05.315 --> 20:06.583
Yeah, you do.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.318
Thank God!

20:14.085 --> 20:15.854
Marco, I had a feeling you'd call.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.715
I just wanted to make up
for the Madonna concert.

20:18.715 --> 20:21.318
Papa don't mean to preach,
but I have a boyfriend.

20:21.789 --> 20:23.340
I just thought that since you're here,

20:23.340 --> 20:25.975
you and your boyfriend aren't exclusive.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.935
It's just a drink.

20:27.936 --> 20:31.249
Yeah, that's what you
said the night we met.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.017
(Marco's voice) Look me in the eye

20:34.017 --> 20:36.878
and tell me that you're
not attracted to me, baby.

20:36.879 --> 20:39.531
That you don't want a big slice of this.

20:39.743 --> 20:41.143
Ah!

20:41.187 --> 20:42.678
Sorry, I can't do this!

20:42.678 --> 20:44.911
Marco... Yolanda... Malanda.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.118
Bye!
