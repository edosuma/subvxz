â™ª â™ª

00:18.000 --> 00:20.929
[cheers and applause]

00:20.929 --> 00:24.230
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:24.230 --> 00:27.870
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.329
[cheers and applause]

00:29.329 --> 00:31.170
â™ª â™ª

00:31.170 --> 00:35.329
- Thanks.

00:35.329 --> 00:38.200
Thank you.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.469
Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

00:40.469 --> 00:42.969
the only place in Vegas
that'll make your coins

00:42.969 --> 00:46.299
disappear faster than a slot
machine.

00:46.299 --> 00:49.130
But what has never disappeared
is the love

00:49.130 --> 00:50.899
between our two stars.

00:50.899 --> 00:53.929
I thought Lily and Marshall's
nine-season relationship

00:53.929 --> 00:56.670
on "How I Met Your
Mother" lasted a long time,

00:56.670 --> 00:59.070
but Penn and Teller have
been performing together

00:59.070 --> 01:02.299
for over 40 years and show
no signs of disappearing

01:02.299 --> 01:04.069
anytime soon.

01:04.069 --> 01:08.170
So let's bring out our
lovebirds, Penn and Teller.

01:08.170 --> 01:11.829
[cheers and applause]

01:11.829 --> 01:13.069
- [speaks indistinctly]

01:13.069 --> 01:15.730
- Where's my little lovebird?

01:15.730 --> 01:17.629
And my other lovebird.

01:17.629 --> 01:19.900
Mwah!

01:19.900 --> 01:22.900
[cheers and applause]

01:26.799 --> 01:29.930
Anyone who manages to fool Penn
and Teller

01:29.930 --> 01:32.729
wins the performance of a
lifetime as part of

01:32.729 --> 01:35.670
their long-running Las Vegas
magic show.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.729
Let's see if anyone can do it
tonight as we

01:37.729 --> 01:39.930
meet our first potential fooler.

01:39.930 --> 01:42.200
[fireworks booming]

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
- I'm Joseph Reohm.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.930
I'm a magician and illusionist.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.370
[dramatic music]

01:46.370 --> 01:49.930
A few years ago, I got burned
really, really bad.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.670
I nearly lost my hand.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.129
â™ª â™ª

01:53.129 --> 01:56.000
Magicians train our hands our
entire lives

01:56.000 --> 01:59.930
to be able to do things that
other people's hands can't do.

01:59.930 --> 02:01.700
Tonight's performance makes me
nervous.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.269
My hands is nowhere near what
it used to be,

02:04.269 --> 02:07.030
so the idea of messing up or
dropping something

02:07.030 --> 02:08.300
freaks me out.

02:08.300 --> 02:12.400
If I pull this off, I'm gonna
feel ecstatic.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.430
But the viewers at home, I know
I'm gonna fool you.

02:16.430 --> 02:20.099
[cheers and applause]

02:20.099 --> 02:22.870
- From his magical and
mysterious mind to yours,

02:22.870 --> 02:25.770
please welcome Joseph Reohm.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.199
[cheers and applause]

02:28.199 --> 02:31.000
- What are you doing with that
glass, boy?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.969
- Ahh, don't you know that
belongs to...

02:32.969 --> 02:34.699
- You'll never be a magician.

02:34.699 --> 02:36.000
[laughs]

02:36.000 --> 02:37.400
- Now, listen close.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.670
You have two hours to sort this
mess, yeah?

02:39.670 --> 02:42.629
And if even one thing is out of
place when you're done,

02:42.629 --> 02:45.469
you'll be stuck cleaning
Penn and Teller's stage

02:45.469 --> 02:48.930
for the rest of your life.

02:48.930 --> 02:52.870
[chortling]

02:52.870 --> 02:53.930
[electronic music]

02:53.930 --> 02:55.400
[cheers and applause]

02:55.400 --> 02:58.930
- You'll never be a magician.

02:58.930 --> 03:02.870
- For the rest of your life.

03:02.870 --> 03:10.870
â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

03:44.770 --> 03:52.770
â™ª â™ª

04:01.699 --> 04:06.000
- You'd better still be
cleaning in here.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.129
While you're at it, make sure
these clothes is clean

04:09.129 --> 04:11.030
before house opens.

04:11.030 --> 04:15.000
- Boy, how's about you do mine
as well?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.569
- [chortling]

04:18.569 --> 04:24.899
â™ª â™ª

04:24.899 --> 04:27.899
[cheers and applause]

04:41.430 --> 04:45.600
- This is just the beginning.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.930
[cheers and applause]

04:49.930 --> 04:55.769
â™ª â™ª

06:04.029 --> 06:07.029
[cheers and applause]

06:18.470 --> 06:22.699
[cheers and applause]

06:25.500 --> 06:27.569
- That was amazing.

06:27.569 --> 06:28.769
- Thank you so much.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.500
- This is such a beautiful
story.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.699
How long did it take you to sort
of come up with this story?

06:35.699 --> 06:38.199
- I have been working on this
for 14 years.

06:38.199 --> 06:40.300
I retired it for about ten
years,

06:40.300 --> 06:41.769
and then this brought life to
it.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.399
And I really want to thanks the
"Fool Us" team

06:44.399 --> 06:47.069
for opening this door for me to
be able to bring it back to life

06:47.069 --> 06:48.829
and give me purpose redo it.

06:48.829 --> 06:50.629
- And--well, is it, like, a
personal story?

06:50.629 --> 06:51.829
How did you come up with it?

06:51.829 --> 06:53.399
- Some stuff was rough when we
were kids,

06:53.399 --> 06:55.000
and I never liked being told no.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.529
I never liked being told that
you can't do something.

06:56.529 --> 06:59.230
So some of the inspiration from
it is that,

06:59.230 --> 07:00.800
"You'll never be a magician."

07:00.800 --> 07:02.930
It's like, "Well, let me show
you what I can do."

07:02.930 --> 07:06.329
- And what would it mean for you
to fool Penn and Teller?

07:06.329 --> 07:08.430
- Well, we've got an
encyclopedia of magic over here.

07:08.430 --> 07:09.699
- Yeah.
- Two of them.

07:09.699 --> 07:11.000
- Right?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.170
- You know, my main goal here
is, if I could fool them,

07:14.170 --> 07:16.129
then that means that I
definitely did not waste

07:16.129 --> 07:17.470
the last 25 years of my life,

07:17.470 --> 07:19.699
but if I could at least
entertain them,

07:19.699 --> 07:21.199
then as far as I'm concerned, I
won.

07:21.199 --> 07:23.829
Because, you know, to be able to
entertain

07:23.829 --> 07:25.670
two of the world's biggest
entertainers,

07:25.670 --> 07:27.000
that's what would mean a lot to
me.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.870
- You absolutely entertained me.

07:28.870 --> 07:32.170
Shall we check in with the
encyclopedias, though?

07:32.170 --> 07:34.000
- Yes, please.
- Gentlemen.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.829
- Oh, my goodness.
What a great act.

07:35.829 --> 07:36.899
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

07:36.899 --> 07:38.300
- I really, really liked it.

07:38.300 --> 07:43.730
You know, one of the things is
that magicians, you know,

07:43.730 --> 07:46.769
are always wearing the top hat
and the tails,

07:46.769 --> 07:50.069
and there's that clichÃ© that
comes from 19th-century France,

07:50.069 --> 07:53.500
and the reason that people still
use that clichÃ©,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.300
even thought no one dresses like
that,

07:55.300 --> 07:58.769
is because there's so much magic
that was developed

07:58.769 --> 08:00.170
with that wardrobe,

08:00.170 --> 08:03.230
and magicians have struggled to
find a way

08:03.230 --> 08:07.329
to have their wardrobe be
helpful and still look modern.

08:07.329 --> 08:09.129
I bet you've thought about that
some.

08:09.129 --> 08:10.569
- Yeah, I mean, I'd get really
cold in here

08:10.569 --> 08:11.870
if I took my jacket off.

08:11.870 --> 08:14.600
[laughter]

08:14.600 --> 08:17.199
- And also, the music is great.

08:17.199 --> 08:18.670
- Thank you so much.
- It's great music.

08:18.670 --> 08:22.300
You know, I'm--I'm old enough
that when I think about music,

08:22.300 --> 08:24.129
I think about going back to a
turntable,

08:24.129 --> 08:26.300
which you could do amazing
things

08:26.300 --> 08:28.129
with two turntables and a
microphone.

08:28.129 --> 08:29.529
- Right.

08:29.529 --> 08:31.300
- And the color changes are
wonderful, all the glass stuff.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.500
You know, I love--maybe more
than other people,

08:34.500 --> 08:37.929
I love themed magic,
and I love the fact

08:37.929 --> 08:41.299
you do it all with the glasses
and all with liquids,

08:41.299 --> 08:44.169
and it's a lot of the billiard
ball moves.

08:44.169 --> 08:46.399
I think I can say this without
getting you angry.

08:46.399 --> 08:48.870
There's some wonderful flip
stick stuff there.

08:48.870 --> 08:52.700
And I also think that the dove
stuff

08:52.700 --> 08:55.070
and the billiard ball stuff
being done with glass

08:55.070 --> 08:58.169
is just greatly--and we are--

08:58.169 --> 08:59.629
although I don't think you
fooled us,

08:59.629 --> 09:03.269
we remain your humble
serve-ants--I mean, servants.

09:03.269 --> 09:05.169
I'm sorry.
[laughs]

09:05.169 --> 09:07.929
- So he's...
- Thank you so much.

09:07.929 --> 09:11.769
- Saying a lot of things that I
certainly don't understand.

09:11.769 --> 09:13.600
Do you maybe understand?
- No clue.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.470
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.730
I'm just kidding.
No, he said it perfectly.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.100
I appreciate you saying it in a
way that--

09:19.100 --> 09:20.570
that we can definitely
communicate.

09:20.570 --> 09:21.870
Yeah, I did not fool them,
but...

09:21.870 --> 09:25.830
- Okay, okay, thank you so much
for being so entertaining.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.429
Thank you, Joseph Reohm.

09:28.429 --> 09:29.700
Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks, guys.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.169
- All right, well...

09:32.169 --> 09:34.299
[cheers and applause]

09:34.299 --> 09:37.000
All right, that was fun, but
we're just getting started.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.870
So stick around and see if
anyone can pull one over

09:39.870 --> 09:41.769
on Penn and Teller.

09:41.769 --> 09:44.769
[jazz music]

09:44.769 --> 09:46.570
â™ª â™ª

09:51.600 --> 09:53.529
[jazz music]

09:53.529 --> 09:57.429
[cheers and applause]

09:57.429 --> 09:58.970
- Welcome back.

09:58.970 --> 10:03.070
Penn and Teller never have any
idea who's gonna be on the show.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.129
So let's surprise them with our
next performer.

10:06.129 --> 10:08.669
[fireworks booming]

10:08.669 --> 10:09.830
- Hi, I'm Brent Braun,

10:09.830 --> 10:11.299
and I work as a magic
consultant.

10:11.299 --> 10:13.500
So I work on not only the
technical side of magic

10:13.500 --> 10:15.669
but also to come in and say,
"This part isn't great.

10:15.669 --> 10:17.700
Let's fix this or move this or
change this,"

10:17.700 --> 10:19.230
what I call "Ugly Baby
Syndrome."

10:19.230 --> 10:21.100
No one knows they have an ugly
baby,

10:21.100 --> 10:23.200
so what I'm able to do is look
at the ugly baby and say,

10:23.200 --> 10:25.029
"No, no, that baby is ugly.

10:25.029 --> 10:26.830
Let's work on making it more
attractive."

10:26.830 --> 10:28.470
[baby crying]

10:28.470 --> 10:30.370
I do so much behind the scene
that I just don't get

10:30.370 --> 10:32.730
the opportunities to do shows
the way I used to.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.100
I got the call two days ago,
made me super nervous.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.529
I've been in my hotel room
rehearsing

10:36.529 --> 10:38.029
over and over and over.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.399
I'm just super excited to be
able to get out there

10:39.399 --> 10:40.870
and try to fool Penn and Teller.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.370
I'm always supporting other
entertainers.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.029
Now it's my opportunity to help
myself,

10:44.029 --> 10:46.100
and I've got my own back.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.330
He's got this.

10:49.330 --> 10:53.899
[cheers and applause]

10:53.899 --> 10:56.899
- Our next magician met his wife
in a magic shop,

10:56.899 --> 10:59.970
making him the first person to
successfully get a date

10:59.970 --> 11:01.899
in a magic shop.

11:01.899 --> 11:04.129
Please welcome Brent Braun.

11:04.129 --> 11:07.629
[cheers and applause]

11:07.629 --> 11:09.200
- Let's make something random
and chaotic.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.570
If you were given a deck of
cards when you come into

11:10.570 --> 11:12.529
the theater this evening, you've
had the opportunity

11:12.529 --> 11:13.970
to shuffle that deck of cards.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.700
I'd like you to put the cards
back into the box,

11:15.700 --> 11:17.730
hold them high above your head
now.

11:17.730 --> 11:19.029
On the count of three, I'm gonna
have everyone

11:19.029 --> 11:20.070
toss the cards at me.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.399
On the count of three, sir,
not yet.

11:21.399 --> 11:22.799
[laughter]

11:22.799 --> 11:24.269
On the count of three, just toss
them at me.

11:24.269 --> 11:27.600
One, two, three.

11:32.269 --> 11:34.769
[laughter]

11:34.769 --> 11:37.899
Today we're gonna be playing by
European standard rules.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.799
That means we're gonna use the
deck of cards

11:39.799 --> 11:44.470
located closest to my right
foot.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.330
That would be this one.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.970
I need a couple of volunteers to
help me out.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.830
You, young lady, would you
please come help me out?

11:50.830 --> 11:53.370
Give her a round of applause as
she makes her way to the stage.

11:53.370 --> 11:54.629
[applause]

11:54.629 --> 11:56.299
And over here, sir, will you
help me out as well?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.230
You can come on up.
Give him a round of applause.

11:58.230 --> 12:01.169
[cheers and applause]

12:01.169 --> 12:02.830
Have a seat here, young lady.
Your name?

12:02.830 --> 12:03.899
- Karen.
- Karen, nice to meet you.

12:03.899 --> 12:05.029
Karen, you can have a seat
there.

12:05.029 --> 12:06.029
Your name, sir.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.169
- Nicholas.
- Nicholas.

12:07.169 --> 12:08.299
Nice to meet you, Nicholas.
I'm Brent.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.230
You can have a seat there for
me.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.070
Karen and Nicholas.

12:12.070 --> 12:14.100
Karen, is there any possible way
that you know

12:14.100 --> 12:15.100
the order of these cards?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.169
- No.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.299
- Is there any possible way
anyone knows

12:17.299 --> 12:18.730
the order of these cards?

12:18.730 --> 12:19.830
- I don't think so.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.330
- I'm with you 100%.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.830
What I'm gonna do is drop these
cards from hand to hand.

12:22.830 --> 12:25.529
I'm gonna have you stay stop for
me anytime you like.

12:25.529 --> 12:27.070
We're gonna have you select a
card.

12:27.070 --> 12:28.730
Now, you're gonna be the only
one that knows

12:28.730 --> 12:30.830
what that card is, so it's
important you remember it.

12:30.830 --> 12:32.169
So if you're not happy with it,
let me know,

12:32.169 --> 12:33.570
and we'll get a different card
for you.

12:33.570 --> 12:34.570
Are you ready, Karen?

12:34.570 --> 12:35.730
- Stop.
- Right there.

12:35.730 --> 12:37.730
That was really early.
Are you sure?

12:37.730 --> 12:39.169
- No.
- Okay.

12:39.169 --> 12:40.330
- Stop.
- Right there. You're sure?

12:40.330 --> 12:41.500
- Yes.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.600
- Can I have you look at the
card?

12:42.600 --> 12:43.799
- Okay.

12:43.799 --> 12:44.830
- Are you happy with that
playing card?

12:44.830 --> 12:46.570
- Yes.

12:46.570 --> 12:47.600
- It's safe to say you don't
know what Karen's card is.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.799
Is that true?
- For sure.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.200
- But you know about where it is
maybe, right?

12:50.200 --> 12:51.899
Because you did watch the cards
fall from my fingertips.

12:51.899 --> 12:53.330
So we'll give the deck a little
shuffle here.

12:53.330 --> 12:56.799
You can watch that that is
indeed a shuffle.

12:56.799 --> 12:58.629
Place the cards on the table.

12:58.629 --> 13:01.100
Now, when you tell this story
later--

13:01.100 --> 13:02.799
and you will tell this story
later--

13:02.799 --> 13:06.169
I want you to remember that
before you ever made a decision,

13:06.169 --> 13:08.000
before I ever asked you to do
anything

13:08.000 --> 13:10.429
that the cards were out of my
control and on the table.

13:10.429 --> 13:11.929
Because when you tell people
what happened,

13:11.929 --> 13:14.470
they're going to think that
somehow I did some funny magic

13:14.470 --> 13:17.200
move, somehow I manipulated or
moved cards

13:17.200 --> 13:18.769
or repositioned them.

13:18.769 --> 13:21.299
I'm gonna have you think of any
number between 1 and 52,

13:21.299 --> 13:23.029
and if this works, Karen's card,
it's gonna be at

13:23.029 --> 13:25.870
exactly that number,
not one before,

13:25.870 --> 13:28.769
and not one after, but exactly
that number.

13:28.769 --> 13:30.000
No pressure.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.429
[laughter]

13:31.429 --> 13:32.700
Would you do me a favor?

13:32.700 --> 13:34.769
Think of a number between 1 and
52 and name it now.

13:34.769 --> 13:37.070
- 41.
- 41.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.330
Karen, keep my honest.

13:38.330 --> 13:39.700
We're gonna count down to the
41st card.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.000
It's gonna take a while, but
keep me honest.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.269
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8,

13:45.269 --> 13:47.629
9, 10, 11, 12--

13:47.629 --> 13:49.029
there's two kind of stuck
together there--

13:49.029 --> 13:52.200
12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

13:52.200 --> 13:54.970
17, 18, 19, 20,

13:54.970 --> 13:57.570
21, 22, 23, 24,

13:57.570 --> 14:01.700
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

14:01.700 --> 14:05.429
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,

14:05.429 --> 14:08.669
37, 38, 39, 40.

14:08.669 --> 14:10.600
Do we both agree that's the 41st
card?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
- Yeah.
- We're good?

14:11.600 --> 14:12.970
- Yes, Yes.

14:12.970 --> 14:14.029
- Do we also agree that you
could have named a number

14:14.029 --> 14:15.399
larger than 41?

14:15.399 --> 14:16.769
You could have arrived at this
card here.

14:16.769 --> 14:19.470
That cards would have been the
queen of hearts.

14:19.470 --> 14:20.629
Was that your card?
- No.

14:20.629 --> 14:21.970
- I knew you had it.
You're doing good.

14:21.970 --> 14:23.269
You're doing good.
We got this. We got this.

14:23.269 --> 14:24.529
Let's keep it going.
Let's keep it going.

14:24.529 --> 14:26.070
We could have named a number
lower than 41.

14:26.070 --> 14:28.700
We'd have ended up down here,
like, near 20,

14:28.700 --> 14:30.629
that would've ended up at this
card,

14:30.629 --> 14:32.230
the 2 of hearts.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.330
Not your card.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.899
- No.

14:34.899 --> 14:37.769
- He's on it. He's got it.
He's got it.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.629
Could've named a card all the
way up here near the top.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.700
I don't know what this is, 5 or
6, somewhere around in there.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.299
That would have been the 8 of
diamonds.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.029
Again not your card.

14:46.029 --> 14:49.870
The interesting thing,
you could have named any number

14:49.870 --> 14:51.399
and gotten any of these other
cards.

14:51.399 --> 14:52.570
Do you see your card in there
anywhere?

14:52.570 --> 14:54.299
- No.

14:54.299 --> 14:58.230
- Hmm, could've have named any
of these numbers

14:58.230 --> 14:59.629
and arrived at any of these
cards.

14:59.629 --> 15:02.700
Just quickly do you see your
card anywhere in there?

15:02.700 --> 15:06.070
- No.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.830
- Now, if you ask a
mathematician

15:08.830 --> 15:12.669
what the odds were
of this being Karen's card,

15:12.669 --> 15:15.399
they would tell you it's 1 in
52.

15:15.399 --> 15:18.429
But for a young boy that grew up
in Henryville, Indiana,

15:18.429 --> 15:20.970
here with the great Penn and
Teller in this amazing studio

15:20.970 --> 15:22.899
with you amazing audience
members,

15:22.899 --> 15:26.600
I would say it's once in a
lifetime.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
Karen, for the first time,
what's your card?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.299
- 3 of hearts.

15:30.299 --> 15:32.669
- Now, we could just let it
remain a mystery.

15:32.669 --> 15:34.399
[laughter]

15:34.399 --> 15:36.299
I could walk away.

15:36.299 --> 15:38.799
You guys could just believe
that Karen

15:38.799 --> 15:39.899
and this gentlemen--

15:39.899 --> 15:41.070
I forgot your name;
I apologize.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.429
- That's all right.
It's okay.

15:42.429 --> 15:44.429
- Were able to create a miracle,
or we could show it to you.

15:44.429 --> 15:45.570
It's up to you all.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.570
[laughter]

15:47.570 --> 15:49.370
What was the card, Karen?

15:49.370 --> 15:52.399
- 3 of hearts.

15:52.399 --> 15:53.830
[laughs]

15:53.830 --> 15:55.799
- Ladies and gentlemen, the 3.

15:55.799 --> 15:57.730
[cheers and applause]

15:57.730 --> 15:59.129
- Brent Braun.

15:59.129 --> 16:00.570
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Buddy.

16:00.570 --> 16:01.870
That was fantastic.
- Watch out.

16:01.870 --> 16:02.970
There's--there's is a mess here.
- Clearly.

16:02.970 --> 16:04.600
- I apologize.
There's a bit of a mess.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.299
- That was a very dangerous
beginning to your performance.

16:08.299 --> 16:10.830
- Well, I didn't realize Vegas
was gonna be so angry

16:10.830 --> 16:13.299
about card tricks,
apparently, but...

16:13.299 --> 16:15.570
- But give people permission to
throw stuff at you,

16:15.570 --> 16:16.600
they're gonna do it.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.169
- Yeah, I agree. I agree.
- Yeah.

16:18.169 --> 16:21.799
I love that you met your wife at
a magic shop.

16:21.799 --> 16:23.029
- I did.

16:23.029 --> 16:25.330
- And then it sort of gave me an
epiphany of, like,

16:25.330 --> 16:28.629
if you're a single woman and
you're looking for a man,

16:28.629 --> 16:31.429
there must be a lot of single
dudes at magic shops.

16:31.429 --> 16:32.629
- They're all single.

16:32.629 --> 16:34.000
Yeah, no, they're all single.
It's great.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.399
- A little love connection.
- Sure.

16:35.399 --> 16:38.570
- So normally you're the
behind-the-scenes guy

16:38.570 --> 16:39.799
helping people with their magic
tricks.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.330
- I am, yes.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.669
It's amazing to be able to make
that transition from helping

16:42.669 --> 16:44.899
other people--helping other
people kind of

16:44.899 --> 16:47.000
follow their dream
to helping me find mine.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.500
To make that transition over has
been incredible.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.230
- All right, I'm gonna check in
with the boys.

16:50.230 --> 16:52.700
- Okay.
- Hello, gentlemen.

16:52.700 --> 16:57.330
- What you did here, Brent, you
started out with a really

16:57.330 --> 17:00.899
burlesque-y, goofy premise of
having people

17:00.899 --> 17:03.730
throw cards at you,
which I want you to know

17:03.730 --> 17:06.170
is more dangerous than you may
think.

17:06.170 --> 17:07.500
[laughter]

17:07.500 --> 17:09.230
I'm just telling you, you do
this a lot of times,

17:09.230 --> 17:10.829
some of the rough places we've
played,

17:10.829 --> 17:12.930
for some of the audiences that
haven't like us,

17:12.930 --> 17:14.299
you're gonna lose teeth, sir.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.470
You're gonna lose teeth.

17:15.470 --> 17:17.029
That's what I'm saying.

17:17.029 --> 17:19.769
Most people come out here and
just hit us with one emotion.

17:19.769 --> 17:21.829
They're funny or they're
amazing,

17:21.829 --> 17:25.000
and you started out with one of
the funniest,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.500
most interesting images we've
seen,

17:27.500 --> 17:32.430
and then at the end, you had a
change that was so beautiful.

17:32.430 --> 17:37.630
You had this entire audience
watching you count to 41.

17:37.630 --> 17:39.130
[laughter]

17:39.130 --> 17:42.230
You know, you were hoping they'd
pick a number like 6 or 7...

17:42.230 --> 17:44.099
- Sure, sure.
- Maybe 20.

17:44.099 --> 17:46.630
And you absolutely held it.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.799
The guts that are required not
to rush through those--

17:49.799 --> 17:51.829
I mean, I'm just talking
theatrically now--

17:51.829 --> 17:53.329
was really, really beautiful.

17:53.329 --> 17:54.599
- Thank you.

17:54.599 --> 17:56.470
- So we started out with a good
laugh at the beginning,

17:56.470 --> 18:00.329
and then at the end, we really
cared about this trick deeply.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.500
- Thank you.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.500
- And all the decks onstage are
wonderful.

18:03.500 --> 18:07.170
We think the secret of this, as
a matter of fact, is in decks,

18:07.170 --> 18:10.069
in decks that you have on the
stage, all of them.

18:10.069 --> 18:12.069
And, you know, during this show,
we've seen a lot of

18:12.069 --> 18:13.200
sleight of hand.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.299
We've even seen sleight of
mouth.

18:15.299 --> 18:19.029
But what we saw here today was
sleight of foot.

18:19.029 --> 18:22.500
And that and with all the other
secrets in the decks

18:22.500 --> 18:25.200
is beautiful, beautiful routine,

18:25.200 --> 18:28.630
and I think we have a pretty
good idea how you did it.

18:28.630 --> 18:30.099
- I agree; I think you have a
pretty good idea.

18:30.099 --> 18:31.869
Thank you guys so much.
I appreciate it.

18:31.869 --> 18:33.099
- Aww, all right.
- Thank you, Alyson.

18:33.099 --> 18:34.500
- So you're sure...
- Hug, hug.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.529
- That you didn't fool them.
- No.

18:36.529 --> 18:37.599
- But you were awesome.
- Thank you, all.

18:37.599 --> 18:39.329
We appreciate it.
- Thank you.

18:39.329 --> 18:41.670
Brent Braun, ladies and
gentlemen.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.299
[cheers and applause]

18:43.299 --> 18:45.730
Well, I was certainly fooled by
that last act.

18:45.730 --> 18:46.799
Were you?

18:46.799 --> 18:48.670
Be honest.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.630
We'll give you a few more
chances to figure things out,

18:51.630 --> 18:55.299
including a shot at busting Penn
and Teller.

18:55.299 --> 18:56.569
Stick around.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.569
[jazz music]

18:59.569 --> 19:01.470
â™ª â™ª

19:06.470 --> 19:09.470
[jazz music]

19:09.470 --> 19:12.470
â™ª â™ª

19:12.470 --> 19:14.200
- Welcome back.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.299
In this envelope, I have a
prediction of who

19:17.299 --> 19:20.970
our next act is.

19:20.970 --> 19:22.299
I was right.

19:22.299 --> 19:24.470
It's a magician.

19:24.470 --> 19:26.599
[fireworks booming]

19:26.599 --> 19:31.829
- My name is Chris, last name
Rose, like the flower.

19:31.829 --> 19:33.500
I'm a magician.
[chuckles]

19:33.500 --> 19:36.369
I do close-up magic in
fine-dining restaurants

19:36.369 --> 19:39.670
drawing out the childlike
aspects of adults.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.799
- Whoa.

19:41.799 --> 19:44.799
- Being a magician has afforded
me the opportunity

19:44.799 --> 19:47.900
to stay home and raise my son,
and it's been amazing.

19:47.900 --> 19:51.099
Plus, it's also helped me to
kind of reconnect with

19:51.099 --> 19:52.900
the child side of me.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.869
I had become stuffy and
unapproachable,

19:55.869 --> 19:57.670
because I had this certain
vision of what a magician

19:57.670 --> 19:59.299
was supposed to be in my head.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.569
So I've kind of stripped away
all of that kind of stuff,

20:02.569 --> 20:04.700
and now it's just me.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.430
When I perform for people, I
mean,

20:06.430 --> 20:07.430
I'm having a good time.

20:07.430 --> 20:08.569
They're have a good time.

20:08.569 --> 20:10.269
And I get paid to make people
happy.

20:10.269 --> 20:11.329
It's great.

20:11.329 --> 20:15.329
[cheers and applause]

20:15.329 --> 20:18.069
- Please welcome Chris Rose.

20:18.069 --> 20:20.900
[cheers and applause]

20:20.900 --> 20:23.630
- Wow.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.170
This is great.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.230
Hi, guys.

20:26.230 --> 20:28.769
I'm Chris, and I need some help.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.099
Teller, would you please join me
onstage?

20:31.099 --> 20:34.200
Penn, honestly, you scare me.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.369
[laughter]

20:35.369 --> 20:37.529
So I would like to invite Alyson
instead.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.029
Would you please join me?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.599
Everyone, give Teller and Alyson
a great big round of applause.

20:41.599 --> 20:42.630
[applause]

20:42.630 --> 20:44.670
Hi, there.
How are you?

20:44.670 --> 20:47.769
- Hey.
- Hi. Welcome. Welcome.

20:47.769 --> 20:53.269
A few years ago, my life was
fairly organized.

20:53.269 --> 20:57.099
Everything had its place and
stayed there.

20:57.099 --> 21:00.170
[nails rattling]

21:05.470 --> 21:08.730
Then my wife and I had a son.

21:08.730 --> 21:09.869
- Oh.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.730
[laughter]

21:12.730 --> 21:18.299
- He's almost two now,
and he moves like lightning.

21:18.299 --> 21:19.930
Those of you who are parents
will know

21:19.930 --> 21:21.670
what I'm talking about.

21:21.670 --> 21:24.630
My life's become total chaos.

21:24.630 --> 21:27.269
The last time I learned this
lesson was while

21:27.269 --> 21:28.569
I was working
around the house.

21:28.569 --> 21:30.670
My things--dangerous things--

21:30.670 --> 21:33.900
went where everything goes when
you're a baby,

21:33.900 --> 21:37.970
right in the mouth.

21:37.970 --> 21:38.970
[audience groans]

21:38.970 --> 21:40.799
- Eww.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.200
- [groans]

21:42.200 --> 21:44.829
[laughter]

21:44.829 --> 21:48.029
- As a parent, I want to do
everything right.

21:48.029 --> 21:50.599
I want to teach my son and lead
by example,

21:50.599 --> 21:53.269
so I came up with a game.

21:53.269 --> 21:55.730
It's really my time to teach.

21:55.730 --> 21:59.130
I call it "snack time."

21:59.130 --> 22:02.769
And since this is Vegas, I
figured I'd up the stakes.

22:02.769 --> 22:04.869
I'm gonna give the two of you a
chance to win

22:04.869 --> 22:07.099
all of the money in my wallet.

22:07.099 --> 22:10.000
- Oh.
- Ahh!

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
[laughter]

22:16.069 --> 22:17.130
- Oh.

22:17.130 --> 22:18.799
- What do these look like to
you?

22:18.799 --> 22:19.869
- $100 bills.

22:19.869 --> 22:22.630
- Absolutely, two $100 bills.

22:22.630 --> 22:26.930
I'm gonna give each of you a
chance to win $100 cash.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.730
I'll explain how to play, but
first, the snacks.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.829
- This is exciting.

22:40.970 --> 22:43.369
- Here, Alyson.
Have a cookie.

22:43.369 --> 22:44.869
- Why, thank you.
- Sure.

22:44.869 --> 22:46.130
You can go ahead and set it
there

22:46.130 --> 22:48.529
- Oh.
- There you go, one for you.

22:48.529 --> 22:49.529
Fantastic.

22:49.529 --> 22:50.869
Don't eat it just yet.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.230
We need something to drink.

22:52.230 --> 22:55.700
[laughter]

22:55.700 --> 22:57.599
You're not lactose intolerant,
are you?

22:57.599 --> 23:00.430
- No.
- Oh, good.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.099
So here's the game.

23:02.099 --> 23:04.829
It's similar to Simon Says.

23:04.829 --> 23:09.829
If you do what I do exactly,

23:09.829 --> 23:13.599
you win $100.

23:13.599 --> 23:18.299
If you don't do what I do
exactly, you lose.

23:18.299 --> 23:20.130
[laughter]

23:20.130 --> 23:23.099
All you have to do to win that
$100

23:23.099 --> 23:28.400
is do exactly what I do from
this point forward.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.500
Ready?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.599
- Ready.

23:30.599 --> 23:33.599
[laughter]

23:47.029 --> 23:49.799
- [chuckling]

23:49.799 --> 23:51.099
- [chuckling]

24:00.069 --> 24:02.099
[laughter]

24:02.099 --> 24:05.099
Ahh.

24:07.769 --> 24:09.670
Ohh.

24:09.670 --> 24:13.400
[laughter]

24:13.400 --> 24:15.230
I'm sorry.
You just lost.

24:15.230 --> 24:18.230
[laughter and applause]

24:22.529 --> 24:25.900
- I don't--well, I already lost.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.069
[gasps]

24:27.069 --> 24:30.430
[applause]

24:30.430 --> 24:32.470
Oh, jeez.
- Mmm.

24:32.470 --> 24:33.869
- You can have the money.
- Huh?

24:33.869 --> 24:36.500
- No, thanks.
Go on.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.400
- Well, guys, you didn't win,
and, of course,

24:38.400 --> 24:41.829
when I'm playing with my son,
I don't reinforce failure.

24:41.829 --> 24:45.400
However, with you,
I'll make an exception.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.869
Here, Alyson, some fresh cookies
for you.

24:48.869 --> 24:50.130
Take them home.
Share them with your family.

24:50.130 --> 24:51.829
- Thank you.
- Sure.

24:51.829 --> 24:56.170
And, Teller, this...

24:56.170 --> 24:59.269
is for you.

24:59.269 --> 25:02.329
- [groaning]

25:05.569 --> 25:08.569
[audience groaning]

25:11.630 --> 25:16.470
[laughter]

25:16.470 --> 25:18.200
Now, don't lose that.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.700
You never know where it will
reappear.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.099
You can have that too if you
want.

25:22.099 --> 25:23.930
- No.

25:23.930 --> 25:27.329
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris
Rose.

25:27.329 --> 25:28.829
[cheers and applause]

25:28.829 --> 25:31.130
Yeah, that was really gross.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.529
Thank you.

25:32.529 --> 25:34.400
But thank you for giving me the
cookies and not your...

25:34.400 --> 25:35.730
- They're sealed.
Yeah, there you go.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.230
- Booger nail.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.829
Ugh, that's so gross.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.369
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm getting distracted.

25:41.369 --> 25:43.730
'Cause Teller is inspecting the
cookie.

25:43.730 --> 25:46.769
And I'm really hoping he doesn't
eat it,

25:46.769 --> 25:48.369
'cause we know where it came
from.

25:48.369 --> 25:51.599
Um, um, okay, so--so...

25:51.599 --> 25:52.799
[exhales]

25:52.799 --> 25:55.099
So somebody introduced you to
this idea.

25:55.099 --> 25:56.099
- Concept, right.

25:56.099 --> 25:57.200
- And--and...

25:57.200 --> 25:58.500
[audience groans]

25:58.500 --> 26:00.769
- Nice.

26:00.769 --> 26:04.329
Good.
- He at the cookie.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.269
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

26:06.269 --> 26:11.269
Uh, guys, Teller, Teller...

26:11.269 --> 26:13.799
Teller, do I need to...

26:13.799 --> 26:14.869
Oh, God.

26:14.869 --> 26:16.500
Oh, jee--oh, jeez.

26:16.500 --> 26:20.400
Should I...oh, this was a family
show.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.630
[laughter]

26:21.630 --> 26:24.670
God, now it's only dysfunctional
families.

26:24.670 --> 26:28.430
All right, well, I--I'm gonna
check in with them,

26:28.430 --> 26:30.430
'cause I'm worried about
Teller's stomach.

26:30.430 --> 26:31.569
Gentlemen.

26:31.569 --> 26:33.230
- Oh, come on.
- Hi. Before--

26:33.230 --> 26:34.470
- We were running experiments,
serious experiments.

26:34.470 --> 26:36.230
- I'm worried about Teller's
tummy,

26:36.230 --> 26:38.730
so--so before he barfs, let's--
let's get to this.

26:38.730 --> 26:41.329
- Yeah, well, Teller has now
eaten cookies

26:41.329 --> 26:43.529
with everyone he's eaten cookies
with for the past 15 years.

26:43.529 --> 26:44.670
- Yes.
- Just so you know.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.099
- He--he's looking a little
green, so...

26:47.099 --> 26:48.529
- Let's start...
- Let's wrap this up.

26:48.529 --> 26:49.900
- With the nail, shall we?

26:49.900 --> 26:51.069
- Yes.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.269
- I more than Teller--
I'm carny trash.

26:53.269 --> 26:55.000
I'm cheap carny trash.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.869
And the brilliance of doing the
blockhead routine

26:58.869 --> 27:01.529
but only doing half of it is
pretty great...

27:01.529 --> 27:02.569
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Really great.

27:02.569 --> 27:04.130
And living like that is a great
thing.

27:04.130 --> 27:06.069
And I bet if you did that--I
don't know if you ever worked

27:06.069 --> 27:08.069
the carnival, but if you did
that in the carnival,

27:08.069 --> 27:09.900
that nail trick, you'd sure have
a lot of pull.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.400
I'm telling you that right now.
- Yes.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.569
- You'd have a lot of pull.
- Absolutely.

27:12.569 --> 27:16.470
- Now, let's get to your cookie.

27:16.470 --> 27:18.269
- You mean the one he ate?

27:18.269 --> 27:20.400
- Yeah, the one he ate, yeah.
- Okay.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.769
Now, we all know the drinking
the water gag

27:22.769 --> 27:24.799
and holding it in your mouth,
then spitting it back out.

27:24.799 --> 27:26.569
I was ready for that gag.

27:26.569 --> 27:31.099
I think--and this is me thinking
this watching it from here.

27:31.099 --> 27:33.769
Teller's not sure, but I'm gonna
go out on a limb,

27:33.769 --> 27:35.130
'cause I'm not sure.

27:35.130 --> 27:40.200
I think that what you did there
was not sleight of hand.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.730
I think it was not a gimmick.

27:42.730 --> 27:45.529
I think it was not a fake prop.

27:45.529 --> 27:49.000
I think what you did there on
that stage

27:49.000 --> 27:53.529
was something I am naming right
now sleight of mouth.

27:53.529 --> 27:56.730
I think you did that with
sleight of mouth.

27:56.730 --> 27:58.000
I think you did it.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.130
I don't think you loaded another
cookie in.

28:00.130 --> 28:01.730
I don't think you palmed one
off.

28:01.730 --> 28:03.400
I don't think you stole one
anywhere.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.200
I think you you did sleight of
mouth.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.369
[laughter]

28:07.369 --> 28:08.470
Am I right?
- Is there such a--

28:08.470 --> 28:09.529
- Am I supposed to confirm or
deny this?

28:09.529 --> 28:11.529
- You--you either confirm or
deny.

28:11.529 --> 28:14.569
Are you skilled enough with your
mouth...

28:14.569 --> 28:16.130
- I...
- Wow, wait.

28:16.130 --> 28:17.369
- How skilled are you with your
mouth?

28:17.369 --> 28:18.829
- Well, now you're getting
personal.

28:18.829 --> 28:20.299
- I am getting personal.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.029
- Do we need to call your wife?
- I'm getting very personal.

28:22.029 --> 28:23.970
How skilled are you with your
mouth, Chris Rose?

28:23.970 --> 28:25.670
How skilled are you with your
mouth?

28:25.670 --> 28:27.869
- I--I am very skilled with my
mouth,

28:27.869 --> 28:30.299
but it was not sleight of mouth.

28:30.299 --> 28:31.599
- Wait.
- It was not.

28:31.599 --> 28:32.829
- I was not sleight of mouth.

28:32.829 --> 28:35.329
- You actually snuck that cookie
in another way?

28:35.329 --> 28:36.829
- Oh, boy.
Wait, oh.

28:36.829 --> 28:38.200
- You actually did?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.529
We ran experiments.

28:39.529 --> 28:40.970
We looked.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.930
We think you almost should be
able to hold that in your mouth

28:42.930 --> 28:45.130
while drinking, and you say you
didn't?

28:45.130 --> 28:47.799
- Correct.
- Okay, then you fooled us, man.

28:47.799 --> 28:49.170
[cheers and applause]

28:49.170 --> 28:50.670
- Oh, my God.

28:50.670 --> 28:52.230
- You fooled us with a cookie.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.569
- Yay.
- With a cookie.

28:53.569 --> 28:55.000
- Wow.
- He fooled us with a cookie.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.200
- That's fantastic.
- Thank you.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.500
- With a cookie.
- Wow.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.630
Oh, my goodness.
Wow, thank you.

29:00.630 --> 29:01.970
- Wow, that's fantastic.

29:01.970 --> 29:04.329
- Totally surprised.

29:04.329 --> 29:06.029
- Amazing.

29:06.029 --> 29:08.000
- Thank you, guys, very much.
- Whoo.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.130
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Rose.

29:12.130 --> 29:15.200
What a fantastic fooler.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.029
One F-U trophy just fell from
the sky.

29:18.029 --> 29:19.230
Will we see another?

29:19.230 --> 29:21.299
We'll find out after this.

29:21.299 --> 29:24.299
[jazz music]

29:24.299 --> 29:26.170
â™ª â™ª

29:31.170 --> 29:34.700
[jazz music]

29:34.700 --> 29:37.799
- Welcome back to "Fool Us,"
where you just might learn

29:37.799 --> 29:40.170
how the greatest tricks in the
world are done,

29:40.170 --> 29:43.500
but only if Penn and Teller can
figure them out first.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.730
Let's meet our next performer.

29:45.730 --> 29:48.269
[fireworks booming]

29:48.269 --> 29:50.269
- I guess I'm a case of arrested
development.

29:50.269 --> 29:52.769
I was an imaginative kid,
and I liked puppets,

29:52.769 --> 29:54.269
I liked juggling,
I liked dancing,

29:54.269 --> 29:55.700
I liked surrealist art.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.029
The challenge is linking all
these things together,

29:58.029 --> 29:59.500
and then I found magic,

29:59.500 --> 30:02.230
and now I get to combine all
these things in my show.

30:02.230 --> 30:05.670
I like surrealist art, because
it feels like magic.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.470
You're creating another world.

30:07.470 --> 30:08.599
[clanks]

30:08.599 --> 30:10.630
When you see me wearing a giant
puppet,

30:10.630 --> 30:13.329
I created that, and it's based
on my own dad.

30:13.329 --> 30:14.369
Well, how you doing, Dad?

30:14.369 --> 30:15.970
Well, uh, I'm fine.

30:15.970 --> 30:17.529
Magdalena is my wife.

30:17.529 --> 30:19.569
Our son, his name is Benji.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.869
He experiences everything with
fresh eyes,

30:21.869 --> 30:23.799
and I get to see him experience
it

30:23.799 --> 30:26.069
just like I was when I was a
kid.

30:26.069 --> 30:28.200
I love having him in the
audience

30:28.200 --> 30:29.829
and being proud of his dad.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.170
I hope you enjoy the show.

30:31.170 --> 30:33.369
Okay.

30:33.369 --> 30:38.130
[cheers and applause]

30:38.130 --> 30:41.000
- Our next performer took dance
lessons to help him

30:41.000 --> 30:45.029
with his magic skills, so let's
see Charles Bach perform

30:45.029 --> 30:47.569
in five, six, seven, eight.

30:47.569 --> 30:52.529
[cheers and applause]

30:52.529 --> 30:53.900
- Hi, everybody.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.400
I'm Charles Bach, and I travel a
lot performing,

30:56.400 --> 30:58.369
so much that it makes it really
hard for me to travel

30:58.369 --> 31:00.970
with a pet, so today I'm
actually gonna give him away

31:00.970 --> 31:03.299
to a new home, and I'd like to
ask Teller to come up here

31:03.299 --> 31:05.599
for just a moment
if you would.

31:05.599 --> 31:07.299
[cheers and applause]

31:07.299 --> 31:09.769
Nice to meet you.

31:09.769 --> 31:11.299
Teller, I want to make sure
there is something

31:11.299 --> 31:12.769
inside this box,
so if you could,

31:12.769 --> 31:14.369
reach your hand down inside
there

31:14.369 --> 31:15.730
and let us know if you feel
something.

31:15.730 --> 31:18.099
Now, don't say anything.

31:18.099 --> 31:20.000
[laughter]

31:20.000 --> 31:21.829
Just nod your head if you do.

31:21.829 --> 31:23.470
Do you feel something inside
there?

31:23.470 --> 31:24.769
Yes?

31:24.769 --> 31:26.299
All right, if you could, take
your hand back out

31:26.299 --> 31:30.670
and take this leash back to your
seat.

31:30.670 --> 31:35.369
[laughter]

31:35.369 --> 31:37.700
[cheers and applause]

31:37.700 --> 31:42.230
Excellent.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.470
And I'd like to ask some
volunteers from the audience

31:44.470 --> 31:46.630
to please just step up to our
microphone over here.

31:46.630 --> 31:48.799
Just come on up and line up
right behind the microphone.

31:48.799 --> 31:49.869
Go ahead.

31:49.869 --> 31:51.799
We need a few, so line 'em up.

31:51.799 --> 31:53.869
There we go.
Wow, they are fast.

31:53.869 --> 31:55.200
Excellent, excellent.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.230
Hi, there.
What's your name?

31:56.230 --> 31:57.529
- Paige.
- Paige.

31:57.529 --> 31:59.829
Paige, this is my wall of
balloons.

31:59.829 --> 32:01.599
I got these from a local car
dealership.

32:01.599 --> 32:02.900
[laughter]

32:02.900 --> 32:04.869
And, Paige, I want you to select
one of those balloons,

32:04.869 --> 32:05.900
any one you like.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.630
- Blue one.
- The blue one.

32:07.630 --> 32:09.369
This is the one we spell.

32:09.369 --> 32:12.200
P-O...gone.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.299
Thank you, Paige.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.029
All right, next person, step up
to the mic

32:15.029 --> 32:16.470
and pick a balloon.

32:16.470 --> 32:17.829
- Purple.
- The purple.

32:17.829 --> 32:19.400
You are not gonna believe this.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.130
That is my favorite color.

32:21.130 --> 32:22.769
[laughter]

32:22.769 --> 32:24.569
Yeah, it...

32:24.569 --> 32:26.099
[laughter]

32:26.099 --> 32:29.000
Well, I guess he was a little
bloated.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.700
All right, next person, step
right up and choose a balloon.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.769
- I choose the green one.

32:33.769 --> 32:34.970
- The green one.

32:34.970 --> 32:36.470
All right, I'm gonna let you pop
this one.

32:36.470 --> 32:38.670
Look right at that balloon,
and look...

32:38.670 --> 32:39.730
[laughter]

32:39.730 --> 32:41.200
You did that with your mind.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.400
- Ohh.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.970
- Amazing.

32:43.970 --> 32:45.130
[cheers and applause]

32:45.130 --> 32:46.470
Hi, there.
Go ahead and pick a balloon.

32:46.470 --> 32:47.500
- I'll take pink,
bottom left.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.569
- The pink one, all right.

32:49.569 --> 32:52.730
This one has something really
cool inside.

32:52.730 --> 32:53.730
Air.

32:53.730 --> 32:54.970
[laughter]

32:54.970 --> 32:56.329
- Thank you.

32:56.329 --> 32:57.829
- The next gentleman.

32:57.829 --> 32:59.569
- Red balloon.
- The red one.

32:59.569 --> 33:01.299
All right, this one's a winner.

33:01.299 --> 33:03.569
An animal balloon.

33:03.569 --> 33:05.170
I'm gonna make you something.

33:05.170 --> 33:07.500
Yep, just call out an animal.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.529
- Snake.

33:08.529 --> 33:09.730
- Dog it is.

33:09.730 --> 33:14.269
[laughter]

33:14.269 --> 33:16.029
[chuckles]

33:16.029 --> 33:19.230
Here we go, a couple of ears,

33:19.230 --> 33:21.630
a couple of legs,

33:21.630 --> 33:26.029
a nice bushy tail,
and there's your doggy.

33:26.029 --> 33:27.829
[cheers and applause]

33:27.829 --> 33:29.329
Whee.

33:29.329 --> 33:31.369
Take good care of him.

33:31.369 --> 33:34.200
All right, our next gentleman,
please pick a balloon.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.200
- The black balloon, please.

33:35.200 --> 33:38.130
- The black balloon.

33:38.130 --> 33:41.369
Let's get this party started.
[laughs]

33:41.369 --> 33:42.930
All right, we're down to just
three balloons,

33:42.930 --> 33:44.529
just three balloons left,

33:44.529 --> 33:47.130
and our next person, please,
pick one of those three.

33:47.130 --> 33:48.299
- I'll take the white one.

33:48.299 --> 33:49.869
- The white balloon.

33:49.869 --> 33:52.400
All right, I've been waiting all
day to get rid of that one.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.170
[chain saw whirring]

33:54.170 --> 33:56.029
[laughs]

33:56.029 --> 33:59.369
Whoo.

33:59.369 --> 34:00.500
Gone.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.869
[cheers and applause]

34:02.869 --> 34:05.200
Now, guys, you get to go back to
your seat, unfortunately,

34:05.200 --> 34:07.930
because I'm down to just two
balloons.

34:07.930 --> 34:10.400
Thanks for stepping up to the
plate.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.199
Now, we are down to just two
balloons,

34:12.199 --> 34:13.599
and since Teller doesn't speak,
Penn,

34:13.599 --> 34:15.670
I'm gonna ask you to pick one of
the remaining

34:15.670 --> 34:17.268
two balloons for Teller.

34:17.268 --> 34:18.329
- Orange.

34:18.329 --> 34:20.099
- The orange, the orange.

34:20.099 --> 34:25.099
Teller, Penn thinks you would
have chosen the color orange.

34:25.099 --> 34:27.130
Is that your card?

34:27.130 --> 34:29.570
- Yes, it is.

34:29.570 --> 34:30.730
Nicely done.

34:30.730 --> 34:33.030
- Now, remember, Teller came up
onstage.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.800
He felt my pet inside the box.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.030
He took the leash back out to
his seat.

34:37.030 --> 34:39.500
We chose many people completely
at random from all over

34:39.500 --> 34:42.730
the theater to narrow this down
to just one single balloon.

34:42.730 --> 34:43.929
Come here, boy.

34:43.929 --> 34:47.670
That's right,
a yellow balloon.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.969
[cheers and applause]

34:49.969 --> 34:51.599
- Whoo,

34:51.599 --> 34:55.130
- And now it's time for us
to let him go to his new home.

34:55.130 --> 34:56.599
Stay.

34:56.599 --> 35:01.900
[laughter]

35:01.900 --> 35:04.900
[cheers and applause]

35:08.000 --> 35:09.800
- All right.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.730
Whoo.

35:11.730 --> 35:13.599
Charles Bach.

35:13.599 --> 35:15.800
[cheers and applause]

35:15.800 --> 35:17.099
Aww, hello.

35:17.099 --> 35:18.369
- Hi, there.

35:18.369 --> 35:22.230
- Ahh, I loved that,
anything with balloons.

35:22.230 --> 35:24.030
All right, well, let's go to the
guys.

35:24.030 --> 35:25.699
I think they're ready.

35:25.699 --> 35:27.969
Penn, Teller...
- Ahh, okay.

35:27.969 --> 35:30.199
- Are you gonna pop his balloon?

35:30.199 --> 35:32.130
- I'm gonna try.
- Burst my bubble?

35:32.130 --> 35:35.800
- You know, you had seven people
up here.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.230
Those people at home that are
trying to learn about magic

35:38.230 --> 35:41.869
by watching this, one of the
things they would think about is

35:41.869 --> 35:45.630
that there might be some sort of
way that you determined

35:45.630 --> 35:46.800
what they were gonna do.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.730
They didn't really have free
choices.

35:48.730 --> 35:52.099
And we want to assure people
that we believe deeply

35:52.099 --> 35:54.769
that they really did indeed have
a free choice.

35:54.769 --> 35:56.800
Not everything that's done like
that is done

35:56.800 --> 35:58.670
with what we call a force.

35:58.670 --> 36:02.900
I like that you had stuff on all
the--all the balloons.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.369
You had a little piece of
business on everything.

36:04.369 --> 36:05.570
That's really good there.

36:05.570 --> 36:07.900
Teller reached into the box.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.099
Teller did feel a balloon.

36:09.099 --> 36:10.329
There's no doubt about that.

36:10.329 --> 36:11.329
He felt that.

36:11.329 --> 36:16.429
Now, there's a principle in
magic

36:16.429 --> 36:18.929
called Too-Perfect principle,

36:18.929 --> 36:23.500
where if there's only one way
the trick could be done,

36:23.500 --> 36:26.829
that's the one way it was done.

36:26.829 --> 36:30.969
We think we know the one way it
could be done.

36:30.969 --> 36:35.530
We think we know the one way you
did it.

36:35.530 --> 36:41.769
And if we're wrong, we are so
deeply fooled.

36:41.769 --> 36:44.300
I don't want to say any more.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.230
I want Teller to do the talking.

36:46.230 --> 36:48.030
He is gonna go up,
and I'll tell you,

36:48.030 --> 36:52.230
if what he says isn't it,
we are plum fooled.

36:52.230 --> 36:55.730
I'm ready to stand up here.

36:55.730 --> 36:58.730
- [speaking indistinctly]

37:01.800 --> 37:03.429
- There is no helium tank.

37:03.429 --> 37:06.429
- [speaking indistinctly]

37:10.369 --> 37:14.570
- Well, did you fool them?

37:14.570 --> 37:15.699
- He got it.

37:15.699 --> 37:19.099
- Aww, ohh.

37:19.099 --> 37:21.869
Well, they are geniuses,
you know.

37:21.869 --> 37:23.230
- Brilliant.
- I know.

37:23.230 --> 37:25.070
It's pretty unbelievable.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.869
Well, thank you so much.
- Thank you, Alyson.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.869
- You didn't fool them, but you
certainly entertained us.

37:28.869 --> 37:31.030
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks, everybody.

37:31.030 --> 37:33.730
- Ladies and gentlemen, Charles
Bach.

37:33.730 --> 37:36.130
Thank you.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.269
[cheers and applause]

37:38.269 --> 37:42.070
We have more magic on the way,
so stay close.

37:42.070 --> 37:45.070
[jazz music]

37:45.070 --> 37:46.929
â™ª â™ª

37:51.929 --> 37:54.929
[jazz music]

37:54.929 --> 37:57.000
[cheers and applause]

37:57.000 --> 37:58.170
[light piano music]

37:58.170 --> 37:59.900
- I'm gonna make a prediction.

37:59.900 --> 38:04.869
It's time to close the show with
a trick by Penn and Teller.

38:04.869 --> 38:07.730
[cheers and applause]

38:07.730 --> 38:15.670
â™ª â™ª

38:15.670 --> 38:18.670
- What's in "The Times" today,
Teller?

38:18.670 --> 38:21.000
Oh, man, all that election
stuff?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.630
Trying to pick one of these guys
is like trying to pick

38:24.630 --> 38:26.530
your favorite Kardashian, isn't
it?

38:26.530 --> 38:27.530
[laughter]

38:27.530 --> 38:29.199
It's kind of a hard job.

38:29.199 --> 38:31.199
Oh, here's--I love reading about
animals.

38:31.199 --> 38:34.630
You know, the oldest gorilla in
the world, Raji,

38:34.630 --> 38:37.500
just celebrated her 59th
birthday.

38:37.500 --> 38:41.300
She celebrated it by eating
fruitcake, growling,

38:41.300 --> 38:43.329
and showing her backside,

38:43.329 --> 38:46.699
same way Bette Midler
celebrates her birthday.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.230
[laughter]

38:48.230 --> 38:50.429
Oh, and business news.
You see this?

38:50.429 --> 38:54.829
Smucker's, the jam company,
they have merged with Folgers,

38:54.829 --> 38:58.269
and they're either gonna call it
Smolgers or--

38:58.269 --> 38:59.969
oh, they're gonna call it
Smolgers.

38:59.969 --> 39:02.469
They've already--they've already
decide here.

39:02.469 --> 39:04.130
I always read the fashion news.

39:04.130 --> 39:05.769
I love reading about fashion.

39:05.769 --> 39:08.369
This designer has come up with a
new dress,

39:08.369 --> 39:11.730
has as big picture of Obama on
it.

39:11.730 --> 39:15.269
You know, putting something
presidential on a dress,

39:15.269 --> 39:17.130
wasn't that Bill Clinton's idea?

39:17.130 --> 39:18.500
I think it was, yeah.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.170
That was his idea, wasn't it?

39:20.170 --> 39:22.599
Oh, Starbucks has a new drink
coming out.

39:22.599 --> 39:26.969
It's sugar-free, fat-free, and
has no whipped cream.

39:26.969 --> 39:29.130
It's called coffee.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.670
Try that for a change.

39:30.670 --> 39:34.099
Did you see the big, long
interview with Prince Charles?

39:34.099 --> 39:36.469
Prince Charles has come out
against

39:36.469 --> 39:39.070
genetically modified food.

39:39.070 --> 39:42.630
Well, if anyone knows about the
dangers of selective breeding,

39:42.630 --> 39:44.329
it's Prince Charles, huh?

39:44.329 --> 39:45.369
Let's read the whole interview.

39:45.369 --> 39:46.400
It's on page 11.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.400
Yeah, there it is right there.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.630
It starts right there.

39:48.630 --> 39:51.369
And it continues on to all of
the other pages.

39:51.369 --> 39:52.670
That's where it is.

39:52.670 --> 39:53.829
[cheers and applause]

39:53.829 --> 39:55.300
- So beautiful.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.869
Oh, my gosh.

39:58.869 --> 40:03.829
And this just in: it's time to
say good night from Las Vegas.

40:03.829 --> 40:07.230
We'll be making more headlines
next week on "Fool Us."

40:07.230 --> 40:08.800
See ya.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.769
[cheers and applause]

40:10.769 --> 40:13.670
So beautiful.
You guys.
