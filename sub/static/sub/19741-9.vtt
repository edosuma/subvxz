WEBVTT

00:00.035 --> 00:01.501
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.504 --> 00:03.921
We are working for Ethan's fiance.

00:03.924 --> 00:05.563
You think she's after
me just for my money.

00:05.564 --> 00:07.688
If somebody had tried to
tell me Ben was using me,

00:07.689 --> 00:08.922
I wouldn't have believed them.

00:08.958 --> 00:10.290
I want to put you on retainer.

00:10.326 --> 00:12.292
- He's trying to own you.
- We're done talking about this.

00:12.294 --> 00:13.994
- She deserves better.
- You mean better than me.

00:13.996 --> 00:15.128
Where are you going?

00:15.164 --> 00:16.196
And can I come with you?

00:16.232 --> 00:17.231
Are you gonna tell Alice and Val?

00:17.233 --> 00:18.365
What, that you're dating a murderer?

00:18.367 --> 00:19.833
- Why do you care?
- She's just using you.

00:19.835 --> 00:20.934
You're gonna end up dead.

00:20.970 --> 00:21.935
Felicity.

00:21.971 --> 00:22.936
How do I know

00:22.972 --> 00:24.571
- I can trust you?
- You don't.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.006
Listen to me. I killed Felicity.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.976
She's alive, and she is
definitely up to something.

00:29.814 --> 00:30.946
You shot her.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.346
Your own girlfriend.

00:33.382 --> 00:34.382
Come on.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.851
She was more your girlfriend
by then, wasn't she?

00:37.887 --> 00:39.686
And your spy.

00:39.722 --> 00:40.687
You were chasing us.

00:40.723 --> 00:44.691
I was pursuing my own interests.

00:44.727 --> 00:47.260
She was disloyal. A clear liability.

00:47.296 --> 00:48.492
You could have fired her.

00:48.495 --> 00:50.864
What, and trusted that
she'd stay out of my affairs?

00:50.866 --> 00:53.566
She couldn't even be
trusted to stay dead.

00:53.602 --> 00:55.535
Right.

00:55.571 --> 00:57.237
Where is she?

00:57.273 --> 01:00.386
Because, this time, I'm
gonna do it properly.

01:00.389 --> 01:01.354
No, you are not, Rhys.

01:01.357 --> 01:02.823
We don't even know why she's here.

01:02.826 --> 01:04.611
To kill us, obviously.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.879
Well, maybe she's here to kill you,

01:05.881 --> 01:07.147
but I just spent two days with her.

01:07.149 --> 01:08.152
Yeah, go on. Rub it in.

01:08.154 --> 01:09.252
If she wanted me dead,

01:09.255 --> 01:11.551
she could have killed me 100 times.

01:11.554 --> 01:12.820
I think she's up to something else.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.054
That's right.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.422
Killing me.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.424
So, once again, where is she?

01:17.460 --> 01:19.025
Put it away!

01:19.061 --> 01:20.193
It's not your move.

01:20.229 --> 01:21.361
It's me she made contact with.

01:21.363 --> 01:22.962
It's my business she's trying to steal.

01:22.998 --> 01:24.464
And she's clearly got help.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.266
And once I find out
who she's working with,

01:26.302 --> 01:27.302
then you can kill her.

01:27.336 --> 01:29.102
But first, I need you

01:29.138 --> 01:32.039
to tell me everything about
the night you shot Felicity.

01:32.074 --> 01:33.573
Perhaps we can find out who helped

01:33.609 --> 01:35.978
bring her back from the dead.

01:35.981 --> 01:38.247
So, your brother murdered a woman

01:38.250 --> 01:40.562
who then came back to life,
but you didn't know any of this,

01:40.564 --> 01:43.183
so you slept with her
and pulled a job with her,

01:43.219 --> 01:44.918
which you now believe she sabotaged.

01:44.954 --> 01:46.116
Yes, exactly.

01:46.119 --> 01:48.054
And what is it you want us to do?

01:48.066 --> 01:50.319
I want you to find out
who she's working with

01:50.322 --> 01:53.292
and what she's planning so
that I can take her down.

01:53.295 --> 01:55.195
And when you say "take her down"...

01:55.215 --> 01:57.398
I wouldn't concern yourself
too much with the details,

01:57.409 --> 01:59.647
if I were you. I know
how squeamish you both are

01:59.668 --> 02:01.935
about my extra-legal...

02:01.971 --> 02:03.659
- Illegal.
- Activities.

02:03.662 --> 02:05.161
Are you going to kill her?

02:05.164 --> 02:06.730
I haven't decided.

02:06.733 --> 02:10.020
What I need is for you to
retrace Felicity's steps

02:10.023 --> 02:11.852
from the day that Rhys
botched her murder,

02:11.881 --> 02:13.113
starting with identifying

02:13.149 --> 02:15.082
whoever it was that saved her life.

02:17.286 --> 02:18.452
Okay.

02:19.596 --> 02:21.488
Rhys says that after he shot Felicity,

02:21.524 --> 02:22.964
he went downstairs to the hotel bar.

02:22.992 --> 02:23.769
Naturally.

02:23.772 --> 02:25.128
Which is where he placed a call

02:25.131 --> 02:27.360
to the firm's corpse removal specialist,

02:27.363 --> 02:28.495
a man named "The Cleaner."

02:28.531 --> 02:29.753
Got to have one of those.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.298
He spent over two hours in the bar.

02:31.333 --> 02:34.078
When he returned to the room,
the corpse was already removed.

02:34.081 --> 02:35.633
So I would start with The Cleaner.

02:35.636 --> 02:37.391
But if The Cleaner
works for Kensington...

02:37.394 --> 02:39.705
He used to, but he vanished
right after this job.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.342
Now, I thought we'd lost him
in the restructuring, but now...

02:42.378 --> 02:44.277
It seems he may be
working with Felicity.

02:44.313 --> 02:46.146
So I need you to find him.

02:46.182 --> 02:48.081
Do you have a name?

02:48.117 --> 02:49.215
No.

02:49.251 --> 02:51.484
But The Cleaner's nom de plume

02:51.520 --> 02:54.387
stems from his... distinctive technique.

02:54.423 --> 02:55.522
Please don't tell us.

02:55.558 --> 02:57.323
Total liquefaction.

02:57.359 --> 02:58.378
- Agh.
- What did I say?

02:58.381 --> 03:00.494
The deceased can literally
be flushed down the drain.

03:00.496 --> 03:02.295
It's really convenient.

03:02.331 --> 03:03.530
- Margot.
- What, you think

03:03.566 --> 03:05.365
it's somehow more civilized
to hack a body to pieces

03:05.367 --> 03:06.527
and haul it around in a sack?

03:06.535 --> 03:08.635
- Because let me...
- Can you please stop?

03:08.671 --> 03:10.270
Okay. We can't.

03:10.306 --> 03:11.337
Can't what?

03:11.373 --> 03:13.273
Do this.

03:13.309 --> 03:14.574
Help you with this.

03:14.610 --> 03:15.808
Come on.

03:15.844 --> 03:17.244
She's trying to kill me.

03:17.279 --> 03:19.245
You'd be preventing a murder.

03:19.281 --> 03:21.681
And if not me, then
think about poor Tessa,

03:21.717 --> 03:22.738
your step-daughter.

03:22.741 --> 03:24.915
Because if I'm gone, she'll
have to live with you.

03:24.918 --> 03:26.384
Permanently.

03:27.345 --> 03:29.645
- All right, fine.
- I had a feeling.

03:29.648 --> 03:31.391
But after this, we're done.

03:31.427 --> 03:33.226
We'll see.

03:41.127 --> 03:43.260
Clear your schedule. I may
need you this afternoon.

03:43.296 --> 03:45.196
Okay. For...?

03:48.759 --> 03:52.493
Don't let me stop you if you
need to go be her henchman.

03:52.538 --> 03:55.105
I'm not her henchman.

03:55.141 --> 03:56.374
Does she know that?

03:58.000 --> 04:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.885 --> 04:07.451
What are you doing?

04:07.478 --> 04:10.647
Just packing for a brief getaway.

04:10.659 --> 04:11.892
You can't. We have a job to do.

04:11.894 --> 04:12.622
I'm sorry.

04:12.658 --> 04:14.025
You're gonna have to tell Justine...

04:14.027 --> 04:16.125
This job isn't coming from Justine.

04:16.161 --> 04:18.195
Look who's back in the bad guy business!

04:18.231 --> 04:19.196
Who's the target?

04:19.232 --> 04:20.398
Ethan Ward.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.800
- Alice's ex.
- He's up to something.

04:23.836 --> 04:26.236
I just need proof and a second-story man

04:26.272 --> 04:27.637
in case of breaking and entering.

04:27.673 --> 04:29.753
Aww. Well, I'm flattered,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

04:29.776 --> 04:31.241
I'm trying to protect Alice.

04:31.277 --> 04:32.376
When Alice finds out,

04:32.412 --> 04:34.244
you're the one that's
gonna need protecting.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.545
I can't do this without you.

04:35.581 --> 04:37.147
Then don't.

04:37.183 --> 04:39.349
Or better yet, ask Justine.

04:39.385 --> 04:41.151
Look, if Ethan is crooked,

04:41.187 --> 04:42.886
then he's a perfect target for the FBI.

04:42.922 --> 04:44.988
Plus, Alice is far more likely

04:45.024 --> 04:47.457
to believe Justine than she is you.

04:47.493 --> 04:48.740
That's true.

04:48.743 --> 04:50.561
And when Justine asks where you are?

04:50.563 --> 04:53.363
Just tell her I had to
go pay my last respects

04:53.399 --> 04:54.565
to an old friend.

04:55.701 --> 04:57.300
I've asked Sophie to make a list

04:57.336 --> 04:59.770
of all the chemical warehouses
in Los Angeles and the Valley.

04:59.806 --> 05:01.605
This has to be the last time.

05:01.641 --> 05:03.040
As soon as we wrap this case,

05:03.076 --> 05:05.375
we are officially done
with Margot Bishop.

05:05.411 --> 05:06.510
Agreed.

05:06.546 --> 05:07.678
We will give her back all of her money,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.012
if we have to, plus interest.

05:09.048 --> 05:10.352
Let's not get crazy.

05:10.355 --> 05:11.682
Well, Ethan will pay us more,

05:11.684 --> 05:13.216
and he won't ask us to hunt down

05:13.252 --> 05:15.027
people who make human
Drano for a living.

05:15.030 --> 05:16.929
So we are accepting Ethan's offer.

05:16.932 --> 05:18.098
Why wouldn't we?

05:19.759 --> 05:21.024
Ben will be fine.

05:21.060 --> 05:22.692
I'm sure he will be.

05:22.728 --> 05:23.994
Once you have the conversation with him.

05:23.996 --> 05:25.495
We don't need to have a conversation.

05:25.531 --> 05:27.092
This isn't Ben's decision to make.

05:27.095 --> 05:29.833
As your business partner,
I could not agree more.

05:29.869 --> 05:31.935
But as your friend...

05:31.971 --> 05:33.363
He's just jealous.

05:33.366 --> 05:36.493
You want me to arrest your
girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.

05:36.496 --> 05:37.828
I know what it sounds like.

05:37.831 --> 05:39.909
This is so refreshingly human of you.

05:39.912 --> 05:41.511
- I'm not jealous.
- Of course not.

05:41.547 --> 05:43.581
Why would you be jealous

05:43.584 --> 05:45.615
of a phenomenally successful

05:45.651 --> 05:47.484
multi-millionaire business tycoon?

05:47.520 --> 05:48.618
He's not a good guy.

05:48.654 --> 05:50.387
He's an extremely good-looking guy.

05:50.423 --> 05:52.389
Seven years ago, the
cops were looking at him

05:52.425 --> 05:54.024
for murder, fraud, and corruption,

05:54.060 --> 05:55.064
but they could never make it stick.

05:55.066 --> 05:56.426
Well, maybe because he
didn't do any of that stuff.

05:56.428 --> 05:57.560
But maybe he did,

05:57.563 --> 05:59.996
and you could be the one
that finally gets him.

06:00.032 --> 06:01.512
That's so sweet of you to pretend

06:01.534 --> 06:02.632
to make this about me.

06:02.668 --> 06:04.636
We catch bad guys. Is
that not what we do?

06:04.639 --> 06:05.854
Where is this coming from?

06:05.857 --> 06:07.938
He wants Alice to work
for him exclusively,

06:07.974 --> 06:09.707
and I just want to make
sure he's on the up-and-up.

06:09.709 --> 06:10.640
For her.

06:10.676 --> 06:11.908
Do I have to tell you

06:11.944 --> 06:13.610
all the reasons why this is a bad idea?

06:13.646 --> 06:14.978
It's a favor.

06:15.014 --> 06:16.673
Not unlike when I went undercover

06:16.676 --> 06:17.747
to save your ex-husband.

06:17.783 --> 06:19.616
Ethan Ward is a private citizen.

06:19.652 --> 06:21.218
He's also a multi-millionaire.

06:21.254 --> 06:23.019
You don't become that
playing by the rules.

06:27.059 --> 06:30.427
I'll swing by our white collar division,

06:30.463 --> 06:32.563
see what I can dig up.

06:33.639 --> 06:36.624
What I don't understand is
if you can't trust this woman,

06:36.627 --> 06:38.293
then why include her in our plans?

06:38.296 --> 06:41.204
So we can draw her
out and find out hers.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.729
She's not gonna tell you anything.

06:42.732 --> 06:43.708
She's gonna kill you!

06:43.711 --> 06:44.909
Yes, but sometimes,

06:44.912 --> 06:47.210
before they kill you, they
got cocky, monologue a bit,

06:47.246 --> 06:48.712
and tell you everything,
and then... Bam!

06:48.714 --> 06:49.747
You kill them.

06:49.749 --> 06:52.082
Let's just kill her now.

06:52.118 --> 06:53.917
Be nice.

06:53.953 --> 06:56.119
Actually, don't. She'll get suspicious.

06:56.155 --> 06:58.255
Hello, darling.

07:00.860 --> 07:02.794
Could you not find child care?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.833
Well, Tessa will be
actually joining us today.

07:04.836 --> 07:06.302
Firm's version of homeschool.

07:07.221 --> 07:10.934
According to Mummy, I'm meant
to be learning from my elders.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.236
So I'll be watching every move you make.

07:13.264 --> 07:16.698
I'm afraid the sit-down with
Keegan didn't go as planned.

07:16.742 --> 07:19.042
Dear. What happened?

07:19.078 --> 07:22.646
Someone moved in, made
a deal ahead of us.

07:22.682 --> 07:24.381
How?

07:24.417 --> 07:26.049
I thought we were the
only ones who knew.

07:26.085 --> 07:27.584
So did I.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.786
Trouble is, I'm not entirely sure

07:29.822 --> 07:31.354
who it is we're up against.

07:31.390 --> 07:32.856
How do you mean?

07:32.892 --> 07:35.959
Keegan was only given a
code name... Mockingbird.

07:35.995 --> 07:37.127
Mockingbird?

07:37.163 --> 07:38.995
Does it mean anything to you?

07:39.031 --> 07:40.964
No. I'm afraid not.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.873
Didn't mean anything to us, either.

07:42.876 --> 07:45.500
Which is why I was considering
reaching out to my brother.

07:45.503 --> 07:46.469
To Rhys?

07:46.505 --> 07:49.327
I didn't realize you
were still speaking.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.696
Is he in town?

07:50.699 --> 07:52.542
Yes. I'm afraid he is.

07:52.578 --> 07:54.047
I'm sure he'd be glad to see you.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.946
I don't know about that.

07:55.982 --> 07:59.449
We left each other on... awkward terms.

07:59.485 --> 08:03.119
Am I the only person in this
family you haven't slept with?

08:03.155 --> 08:05.655
All right. That's enough.

08:05.691 --> 08:09.192
Let's come up with a plan
to draw out this Mockingbird.

08:12.431 --> 08:14.365
I'll call in a bit.

08:25.645 --> 08:26.844
Rhys.

08:28.214 --> 08:29.479
Felicity.

08:29.515 --> 08:32.775
I can't believe you came all
the way back from the dead

08:32.806 --> 08:33.984
and didn't call.

08:38.254 --> 08:41.278
I never got to thank you
properly for the scar, did I?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.125
I suppose that's why
you've come back, is it?

08:43.126 --> 08:44.871
- To kill me.
- Yes.

08:44.874 --> 08:46.161
Among other things.

08:46.197 --> 08:47.663
I suppose I don't need to ask

08:47.699 --> 08:48.970
how you knew where to find me.

08:48.973 --> 08:50.293
To give my sister her due credit,

08:50.301 --> 08:51.667
she did try to warn me off of you.

08:51.703 --> 08:54.002
I decided not to take her advice.

08:54.038 --> 08:56.405
The two of you seem to
cloud each other's judgment.

08:56.441 --> 08:57.472
Do we?

08:57.508 --> 08:59.575
This is all your fault, you know.

08:59.578 --> 09:00.791
I wouldn't have had to shoot you

09:00.793 --> 09:02.945
if you hadn't gone
behind my back with her.

09:02.947 --> 09:04.646
If you are planning to shoot me,

09:04.682 --> 09:06.548
there's something you should know.

09:06.584 --> 09:07.549
What is it?

09:07.585 --> 09:09.985
Your sister...

09:10.021 --> 09:12.221
was much better in bed.

09:12.812 --> 09:14.483
You know, I actually felt guilty

09:14.486 --> 09:15.992
about killing you the first time.

09:16.027 --> 09:17.793
This time, I think I'm
gonna rather enjoy it.

09:21.633 --> 09:25.100
If you want your niece to
live, you'll lower your gun.

09:25.136 --> 09:26.638
For the love of... Are you Tessa?

09:26.641 --> 09:30.539
If she dies, I doubt Margot
and Ben will let you live.

09:33.611 --> 09:35.477
Are... Are you all right?

09:35.513 --> 09:37.179
Next time, put one in my shoulder

09:37.215 --> 09:40.749
if it means getting a
clean shot at that bitch.

09:40.785 --> 09:41.850
I'm Tessa.

09:41.886 --> 09:43.719
Rhys.

09:43.755 --> 09:44.853
I like you already.

09:50.444 --> 09:53.244
Have you seen how much
Ethan gives to charity?

09:53.247 --> 09:54.396
He's a saint.

09:54.432 --> 09:56.131
He's the worst.

09:56.167 --> 10:00.436
Saints aren't typically guilty
of fraud and money laundering.

10:00.471 --> 10:03.170
You were right. Ethan Ward is a bad guy.

10:03.173 --> 10:04.726
I'm sorry, could you say all that again?

10:04.728 --> 10:05.894
That sounded so beautiful.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.477
Our analyst flagged some
financial irregularities

10:08.513 --> 10:10.512
on one of his projects.

10:11.788 --> 10:14.454
A multi-condo luxury
resort in Cozumel.

10:14.457 --> 10:15.785
According to the paperwork,

10:15.787 --> 10:17.260
construction was completed last month.

10:17.262 --> 10:18.921
I had our people in Mexico check it out.

10:18.957 --> 10:20.453
They sent back this photo.

10:20.456 --> 10:22.791
It doesn't exist.

10:22.827 --> 10:23.926
No, it does not.

10:23.962 --> 10:25.761
Where do you suppose
the money's really going?

10:25.763 --> 10:27.763
My best guess... somewhere offshore.

10:27.799 --> 10:29.264
Ethan is going to jail.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.166
And his signature on these approvals

10:31.202 --> 10:34.169
is all the bureau needs to charge him.

10:37.342 --> 10:38.774
I thought this is what you wanted.

10:38.810 --> 10:41.109
It is, except this
isn't Ethan's signature.

10:41.145 --> 10:43.578
How can you be sure?

10:43.614 --> 10:44.947
'Cause I've seen it over and over again

10:44.949 --> 10:46.615
in the billions and billions of filings

10:46.651 --> 10:48.384
I've been reviewing this morning.

10:48.419 --> 10:50.385
Any decent forger would see

10:50.421 --> 10:52.220
the line spacing is totally different

10:52.256 --> 10:53.889
and the D's do not match.

10:53.909 --> 10:55.889
Someone is signing Ethan's name

10:55.908 --> 10:57.774
to funnel money through a fake property.

10:57.777 --> 10:59.461
Probably one of his own employees.

10:59.497 --> 11:01.229
Well, either way...

11:01.265 --> 11:02.331
You get your wish.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.196
Ethan Ward is screwed.

11:04.199 --> 11:05.701
Anything on The Cleaner?

11:05.737 --> 11:08.303
You really do not want to know.

11:08.339 --> 11:09.972
- My God.
- Yeah.

11:10.008 --> 11:11.273
Were those bodies?

11:11.309 --> 11:12.196
They used to be.

11:12.199 --> 11:13.909
Welcome to life with Margot Bishop.

11:13.911 --> 11:15.577
We thought if we figured out

11:15.613 --> 11:17.746
how The Cleaner does what he does,

11:17.782 --> 11:19.683
we might get a lead
on where he could be.

11:19.686 --> 11:20.349
And?

11:20.385 --> 11:22.150
And it turns out we're
not the first people

11:22.186 --> 11:25.152
to ask the Internet how
to liquefy a human body.

11:25.155 --> 11:27.403
Okay.

11:27.406 --> 11:28.757
We have to see this through.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.392
Let's look into these vendors.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.560
Look for bulk sales.

11:31.596 --> 11:34.062
Anything that might lead...

11:34.065 --> 11:37.099
I promise you that as
soon as we find this guy,

11:37.135 --> 11:38.934
we are done with Margot Bishop.

11:40.638 --> 11:41.937
Hey.

11:41.973 --> 11:43.538
Can we talk about Ethan Ward?

11:43.574 --> 11:45.374
Depends on what you want to say.

11:45.410 --> 11:46.750
I want to say that,

11:46.753 --> 11:50.145
in my desire to protect
you, I may have overstepped.

11:50.181 --> 11:53.081
I have no right to tell you
what to do or who to work for.

11:53.117 --> 11:54.082
I love you.

11:54.118 --> 11:55.550
I love you, too.

11:55.586 --> 11:58.186
And you have nothing to
worry about with me and Ethan.

11:58.222 --> 11:59.187
I know that.

11:59.223 --> 12:00.136
Good, I'm glad,

12:00.139 --> 12:02.424
because Val and I are
going to accept his offer.

12:02.427 --> 12:03.359
Allie...

12:03.394 --> 12:04.960
- Do you know why?
- Listen to me.

12:04.996 --> 12:06.495
Because, currently, your baby mama

12:06.531 --> 12:09.190
has us tracking down a
man who liquefies corpses

12:09.193 --> 12:11.367
because a Kensington assassin
is back from the dead,

12:11.369 --> 12:12.434
and it's not even noon.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.502
If you'll recall,

12:13.505 --> 12:14.954
I also asked you not to work for Margot.

12:14.956 --> 12:15.971
I'm sorry.

12:16.007 --> 12:17.439
Is this an apology call

12:17.475 --> 12:19.318
or a call about how right you
always are about everything?

12:19.320 --> 12:20.342
Apology call.

12:20.378 --> 12:22.377
Good, because working for Ethan

12:22.413 --> 12:25.747
would solve all of AVI's problems.

12:25.783 --> 12:27.416
And I can't keep asking good people

12:27.452 --> 12:28.483
to do terrible things.

12:28.519 --> 12:29.484
I get it.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.019
You do? Really?

12:31.055 --> 12:33.321
I do.

12:38.329 --> 12:39.261
What?

12:39.297 --> 12:41.863
We have to save Ethan Ward.

12:41.899 --> 12:44.166
What the hell were you thinking?

12:44.202 --> 12:45.468
I don't know, that
I'd come rescue you

12:45.470 --> 12:47.636
from a manipulative and
highly skilled assassin.

12:47.672 --> 12:48.904
Would you like one?

12:48.940 --> 12:50.072
What? No.

12:50.108 --> 12:51.807
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yes, thanks.

12:51.843 --> 12:53.775
I had Felicity right where I wanted her,

12:53.811 --> 12:54.943
where I could watch her.

12:54.979 --> 12:57.212
You were doing a
little bit more than that.

12:57.248 --> 12:58.547
Yes, well, thanks to your cowboy stunt,

12:58.549 --> 13:00.015
now she knows we're onto her.

13:00.051 --> 13:01.917
And she's on the loose,
armed, and dangerous.

13:01.953 --> 13:03.552
Yeah, I know. I trained her.

13:03.588 --> 13:04.719
Can you train me?

13:04.755 --> 13:05.953
- Yeah, of course, darling.
- No!

13:05.955 --> 13:08.457
We are on caution protocol until
she is found and neutralized.

13:08.459 --> 13:10.258
And I'm upping security until then.

13:10.294 --> 13:12.461
Tessa, I'm so sorry.

13:12.497 --> 13:14.963
Your mum used to be fun, I swear.

13:14.999 --> 13:16.298
Is this a joke to you?

13:16.334 --> 13:19.468
Rhys, we are under attack.

13:19.504 --> 13:21.770
No, Felicity is under attack

13:21.806 --> 13:24.739
because I'm gonna finish
the job for good this time...

13:24.775 --> 13:25.992
once I find her.

13:25.995 --> 13:27.695
And how do you plan to do that?

13:29.858 --> 13:33.381
There's 132 chemical
suppliers in the area,

13:33.417 --> 13:36.018
so if we divide them geographically...

13:37.421 --> 13:38.988
What's wrong?

13:41.659 --> 13:43.826
What are you all standing around for?

13:45.062 --> 13:46.995
We have work to do.

13:50.541 --> 13:51.597
Valerie Anderson.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.518
What a pleasure to finally meet

13:53.520 --> 13:56.258
the other beauty and brains
behind this operation.

13:56.261 --> 13:58.401
If this is you trying to win me over,

13:58.448 --> 13:59.380
it's not working.

13:59.424 --> 14:01.023
Well, give it a sec.

14:01.059 --> 14:02.491
Takes a while to kick in.

14:02.527 --> 14:04.626
We appreciate you wanting to help, Rhys,

14:04.662 --> 14:06.200
but we can find The Cleaner without you.

14:06.202 --> 14:08.731
No, you can't. You've got nothing.

14:08.767 --> 14:10.844
And now that Felicity's disappeared,

14:10.847 --> 14:11.912
we have no time.

14:11.915 --> 14:13.047
Disappeared? When?

14:13.050 --> 14:14.770
I thought Felicity was with Margot.

14:14.806 --> 14:16.605
She was. Now she's not.

14:16.641 --> 14:18.340
You tried to kill her, didn't you?

14:18.376 --> 14:20.166
Twice, actually.

14:20.169 --> 14:22.969
- But, you know, third time's the charm, so...
- No.

14:22.972 --> 14:24.596
We are not gonna help
you find this woman

14:24.599 --> 14:26.447
just so that you can kill her... again.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.516
Listen.

14:27.526 --> 14:30.127
Not only do I have underworld contacts,

14:30.142 --> 14:31.974
I also have favors I can call in...

14:32.010 --> 14:34.610
Favors that can help
us lure out The Cleaner

14:34.646 --> 14:39.115
faster than whatever
clue trail you're chasing.

14:39.151 --> 14:41.884
I hate to say it, but the
sooner we find The Cleaner,

14:41.920 --> 14:44.387
the sooner we are done
with Margot Bishop.

14:44.423 --> 14:45.855
I like her.

14:45.891 --> 14:47.189
And her brother.

14:47.225 --> 14:48.457
I take that back.

14:48.493 --> 14:51.627
If you try to kill Felicity
on my watch, I will shoot you.

14:51.663 --> 14:52.895
No, you won't.

14:52.931 --> 14:54.464
- You're too good.
- I'm not.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.734
I believe you.

14:58.770 --> 15:00.970
This is gonna be
fun! Which desk is mine?

15:01.006 --> 15:02.471
And do I get my own computer?

15:02.507 --> 15:05.144
Because if I do, you should
know I am a Mac person.

15:09.047 --> 15:10.546
So you're not a criminal.

15:10.582 --> 15:13.215
Not anymore. Technically.

15:13.251 --> 15:14.750
Now he's one of the good guys,

15:14.786 --> 15:16.052
which is why you're here.

15:16.088 --> 15:18.020
Someone in your company
is defrauding investors

15:18.056 --> 15:19.458
and laundering a lot of money.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.661
We need to know who.

15:21.608 --> 15:22.773
How'd you find this?

15:22.794 --> 15:24.858
You asked Alice to work
with you exclusively.

15:24.861 --> 15:26.840
I needed to make sure
you were on the up-and-up.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.576
So you had the FBI spy on me.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.178
Inquire about.

15:30.181 --> 15:32.469
Your record isn't exactly spotless.

15:33.905 --> 15:35.338
I don't do that stuff anymore.

15:35.374 --> 15:36.405
That makes two of us.

15:36.441 --> 15:38.736
Even so, that can put you in jail.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.060
I'm sorry, are you threatening me?

15:40.062 --> 15:41.777
- No.
- No, actually.

15:41.813 --> 15:44.513
Believe it or not,
we're trying to help you.

15:44.549 --> 15:45.656
Why?

15:45.659 --> 15:48.184
Because clearly, you do need
AVI as your security firm,

15:48.220 --> 15:50.576
and I'm not about to let
Alice go down because of this.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.188
Does she know about this?

15:52.224 --> 15:54.057
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.661
Because she will so bust
you for stalking me, right?

15:58.697 --> 16:00.796
She absolutely will.

16:03.168 --> 16:04.800
I'd have done the same thing.

16:06.381 --> 16:07.737
So what do we do now?

16:07.773 --> 16:08.838
What can you tell us

16:08.874 --> 16:10.473
about the Cozumel resort
that doesn't exist?

16:10.475 --> 16:11.140
Nothing.

16:11.176 --> 16:12.308
This is the fist I'm hearing

16:12.344 --> 16:14.176
anything about a property in Cozumel.

16:14.212 --> 16:15.845
Who in your office would have the means

16:15.881 --> 16:17.081
to create something like this?

16:17.115 --> 16:18.681
Someone in Commercial Development.

16:18.717 --> 16:20.449
I got 50 people over there.

16:20.485 --> 16:21.439
Right.

16:21.442 --> 16:22.719
So we'll need to find a way

16:22.721 --> 16:24.587
to narrow that number down to one.

16:24.590 --> 16:27.957
I will need at least two men
outside this door at all times.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.825
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

16:29.861 --> 16:31.260
I'm not afraid of Felicity.

16:31.296 --> 16:32.261
Well, you should be.

16:32.297 --> 16:33.863
Felicity was our top assassin.

16:33.899 --> 16:35.798
I will not risk letting
you out of my sight

16:35.834 --> 16:36.666
until she's caught.

16:36.702 --> 16:38.634
And with Felicity on the lam,

16:38.670 --> 16:40.672
I am going to need you to help me

16:40.675 --> 16:42.138
hijack these drugs this afternoon.

16:42.174 --> 16:43.739
Stocking up, are we?

16:43.775 --> 16:44.874
No, darling.

16:44.910 --> 16:46.676
This party belongs to the Mockingbird.

16:46.712 --> 16:48.344
And once we steal his cargo...?

16:48.380 --> 16:49.545
Then I will leverage it,

16:49.581 --> 16:52.548
find out who he is and how I might...

16:52.584 --> 16:53.683
Kill him.

16:53.719 --> 16:55.452
Bend him to my will.

16:55.487 --> 16:57.653
Keegan's deliveries arrive at 3:00 P.M.

16:57.689 --> 16:59.722
There will be a driver
and an armed guard,

16:59.758 --> 17:01.857
plus a bartender who
I'll be impersonating

17:01.893 --> 17:03.159
to sign for everything.

17:03.195 --> 17:05.994
You as the bartender,
with two other targets...

17:06.031 --> 17:08.263
We need one more
person to pull this off.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.398
But if it's not your
brother or your girlfriend,

17:10.435 --> 17:13.703
then who's left?

17:13.739 --> 17:15.404
You want me to help with a hijacking?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.205
Well, it's strictly tactical.

17:17.242 --> 17:20.009
There's no reason for
anyone to get hurt.

17:20.045 --> 17:22.078
Except for the one guy you're drugging

17:22.114 --> 17:23.334
and the two that you're tasing.

17:23.336 --> 17:24.246
Yes, exactly.

17:24.281 --> 17:25.815
It's perfectly nonviolent.

17:25.851 --> 17:28.050
Of course, we'll be armed...

17:28.086 --> 17:29.385
for our own protection.

17:30.188 --> 17:31.219
We?

17:31.222 --> 17:32.722
Well, I can't leave her on her own.

17:32.724 --> 17:34.435
With Felicity out there, it isn't safe.

17:36.294 --> 17:39.229
May I speak with you
privately for a second?

17:39.271 --> 17:41.605
Um, Tessa, darling,
you'll want to get changed.

17:43.235 --> 17:46.702
No sex. We haven't time.

17:49.674 --> 17:51.273
Look, if you're going to lecture me

17:51.309 --> 17:52.708
about my parenting choices...

17:52.744 --> 17:54.444
Are we dating?

17:55.447 --> 17:56.412
What?

17:56.448 --> 17:58.240
'Cause if you're asking me to do this

17:58.243 --> 18:00.139
as your henchman...

18:00.142 --> 18:01.317
You're not my henchman.

18:01.353 --> 18:03.920
Then what am I, exactly?

18:05.323 --> 18:07.757
Honestly, I-I don't know.

18:07.793 --> 18:09.391
I don't know what this is.

18:09.427 --> 18:16.198
I don't even know if I'm
really someone who dates.

18:16.234 --> 18:17.234
Got it.

18:18.904 --> 18:20.636
But what I do know

18:20.672 --> 18:28.043
is that you are the only
person in the world right now

18:28.079 --> 18:30.213
who I actually trust.

18:32.184 --> 18:38.187
Try Sebastian Smith, A.K.A. "Big Bash."

18:38.223 --> 18:40.241
I believe he used to keep The Cleaner

18:40.244 --> 18:41.309
on the payroll full-time.

18:41.312 --> 18:43.456
You want us to reach
out to a mass murderer?

18:43.459 --> 18:45.028
Bash is more of a serial murderer.

18:45.030 --> 18:47.830
Mr. Bash is in federal prison.

18:47.866 --> 18:50.040
Life sentence for a double homicide.

18:50.043 --> 18:52.409
Well, it was only a matter of time.

18:52.412 --> 18:55.271
Try Nicholas Bennett.

18:55.307 --> 18:58.941
He was always outbidding me
when it came to hiring vendors.

18:58.977 --> 19:01.510
You say that like Kensington's
a Fortune 500 company.

19:01.546 --> 19:03.612
Well, under my leadership,
it could have been.

19:03.648 --> 19:05.448
Nicholas Bennett's an unsolved murder.

19:05.483 --> 19:07.316
Stabbed multiple times in the back.

19:07.352 --> 19:09.819
There's karma for you.

19:09.855 --> 19:11.806
What about since Margot's
taken over Kensington?

19:11.809 --> 19:13.489
She must have contacts.

19:13.525 --> 19:15.224
First of all, I resent the implication

19:15.260 --> 19:17.377
that my contacts might be outdated.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.196
Although, you might be onto something.

19:20.198 --> 19:21.130
How?

19:21.166 --> 19:22.498
Because Margot just pulled a job

19:22.534 --> 19:24.400
on Raymond Taggart at
his daughter's Sweet 16.

19:24.436 --> 19:26.001
Then why would he help us?

19:26.037 --> 19:27.537
Because Margot owns him now.

19:27.539 --> 19:29.705
Raymond Taggart...
Not dead or in prison.

19:29.741 --> 19:31.941
Definitely the most
promising horrible person

19:31.977 --> 19:33.309
- we've looked at so far.
- We'll call Taggart!

19:33.311 --> 19:34.231
He'll call The Cleaner,

19:34.246 --> 19:35.511
and when The Cleaner gets there,

19:35.513 --> 19:37.180
we'll be there waiting
for him. Easy peasy.

19:37.182 --> 19:38.981
This sounds suspiciously
too good to be true.

19:39.017 --> 19:40.115
Not at all.

19:40.151 --> 19:43.519
All we have to do is
provide a fresh corpse.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.724
So, I'm not one to gossip.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.359
You boys know I don't gossip,

19:50.395 --> 19:52.928
but you know how other people are.

19:52.964 --> 19:55.197
And, what I'm hearing is.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.233
Taggart's, entire operation

19:57.269 --> 19:59.602
has been swallowed by a bigger fish.

20:00.772 --> 20:03.539
I mean, you don't have
to tell me, but...

20:03.575 --> 20:05.441
In fact, you know what?

20:05.477 --> 20:08.711
Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

20:10.415 --> 20:13.048
I don't take sides in the war.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.834
Well, I just make sure

20:16.855 --> 20:20.256
the floors are clean enough
to eat off afterwards.

20:22.761 --> 20:24.927
My God.

20:24.963 --> 20:26.929
You recognize him?

20:26.965 --> 20:28.731
It's Rhys Griffiths, your old boss.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.532
I know who it is. Who are you?

20:30.568 --> 20:33.102
Alice Vaughan.
Anderson/Vaughan Investigations.

20:33.138 --> 20:36.839
And, ironically, we're here
to clean up a mess you made.

20:36.875 --> 20:37.973
We?

20:38.009 --> 20:39.541
Boom.

20:42.614 --> 20:43.579
Rhys.

20:43.615 --> 20:44.880
Dear.

20:44.916 --> 20:47.417
Did I just kill our only lead?

20:49.700 --> 20:51.411
I want you tell me
exactly what happened.

20:51.414 --> 20:53.313
I told you what happened.

20:53.316 --> 20:54.748
Tell us again, please.

20:54.784 --> 20:58.463
I got a call to come to the
Weatherby for a cleaning.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.921
I got there, I saw the problem,

21:00.957 --> 21:02.455
I liquefied the problem,

21:02.491 --> 21:05.038
I poured the problem down the drain.

21:05.041 --> 21:05.972
Really?

21:05.975 --> 21:06.913
Really.

21:06.916 --> 21:08.561
Then why was my sister having sex

21:08.564 --> 21:10.630
with "the problem" yesterday?

21:10.666 --> 21:12.098
That's not my problem.

21:12.134 --> 21:14.082
Yeah?

21:14.085 --> 21:17.304
All right. Let's start again, shall we?

21:17.340 --> 21:18.438
Sure.

21:18.474 --> 21:20.907
First of all, you worked for Rhys.

21:20.943 --> 21:22.442
You know what he's capable of.

21:22.478 --> 21:24.411
But you don't know me.

21:24.447 --> 21:28.115
And since you're not dead already,

21:28.150 --> 21:32.852
you're probably thinking,
"She must be the sane one here."

21:32.888 --> 21:34.821
She must be the good cop.

21:34.857 --> 21:37.257
And I am.

21:37.293 --> 21:41.661
But here's the thing...

21:41.697 --> 21:44.831
The longer is takes for
you to tell me the truth,

21:44.867 --> 21:49.636
the more time I have
to spend with you two.

21:49.672 --> 21:50.904
Ooh.

21:50.940 --> 21:54.308
And, no offense, but you two
make me sick to my stomach.

22:02.043 --> 22:04.188
So. How about you?

22:05.588 --> 22:07.688
How's your stomach?

22:09.058 --> 22:10.423
All right.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.792
The truth is...

22:12.828 --> 22:14.594
I never even saw the body.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.129
What do you mean?

22:16.165 --> 22:17.764
You called me at 9:30,

22:17.800 --> 22:21.101
and when I got there at 11:00,
there was no corpse to clean.

22:21.137 --> 22:23.792
I figured you had somebody else come in.

22:23.795 --> 22:26.940
Wait, so you kept my
money and disappeared.

22:26.976 --> 22:29.242
Look, the next one is on me.

22:29.278 --> 22:31.811
Mate, the next one is you.

22:31.847 --> 22:33.980
So, within that 90-minute window,

22:34.016 --> 22:35.582
someone else came into your room.

22:35.618 --> 22:37.550
And saved your problem's life.

22:37.586 --> 22:38.819
Like you just saved yours.

22:40.211 --> 22:43.179
Who else had access to the room?

22:44.560 --> 22:47.861
This is everyone from that department.

22:47.897 --> 22:49.797
We'll start with background checks.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.599
How did this happen?

22:52.635 --> 22:53.667
That's what we're gonna find out.

22:53.669 --> 22:54.801
No, I mean, you and Ben.

22:54.837 --> 22:57.103
Your deal.

22:57.139 --> 22:58.972
When I met Ben,

22:58.975 --> 23:02.376
he had surrendered to the FBI
for something he didn't do.

23:02.445 --> 23:04.010
Why would he do that?

23:04.046 --> 23:05.879
To protect Alice Vaughan.

23:07.450 --> 23:10.150
I'm not the one that put him
on the straight and narrow.

23:10.186 --> 23:11.117
She did.

23:11.153 --> 23:13.353
He's doing this for her.

23:16.692 --> 23:19.693
I think I found a way to
catch our million-dollar mole.

23:19.729 --> 23:24.431
All for the low, low price of $0.99.

23:24.467 --> 23:27.668
You'll have your assistant pass
this card around the office.

23:29.071 --> 23:32.505
It's Mr. Ward's birthday.
Everyone needs to sign.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.941
Once signed, it'll
give us the signatures

23:34.977 --> 23:36.443
of all 52 employees

23:36.479 --> 23:38.112
in your Commercial
Development department.

23:38.114 --> 23:40.313
We'll compare those signatures
to your forged signature

23:40.349 --> 23:42.315
from the Cozumel property paperwork.

23:42.351 --> 23:43.450
It's only a matter of time

23:43.486 --> 23:46.186
before the FBI software
pinpoints a match.

23:46.222 --> 23:47.687
Who's Carol Cooney?

23:47.723 --> 23:49.456
Carol's been with us for years.

23:49.492 --> 23:50.791
She's very good at what she does.

23:50.793 --> 23:51.897
Could this be a mistake?

23:51.900 --> 23:53.226
Well, there's no proof yet.

23:53.262 --> 23:54.994
And handwriting rarely
holds up in court.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.796
So what's our next move?

23:56.832 --> 23:58.498
You said she's good at what she does.

23:58.534 --> 24:00.734
Maybe it's time Carol got a promotion.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.269
You'll call her, give her the good news,

24:02.271 --> 24:03.929
then take her out to lunch to celebrate.

24:03.932 --> 24:05.972
Carol, thank you so much for coming.

24:06.008 --> 24:07.407
Mr. Ward, thank you.

24:07.443 --> 24:09.309
This is such a treat!

24:09.345 --> 24:10.778
You'll chat for a bit, then tell her

24:10.780 --> 24:12.379
the reason she's
getting the promotion now

24:12.381 --> 24:14.848
is because she's about
to make your company

24:14.884 --> 24:16.182
- millions.
- Millions.

24:16.218 --> 24:17.817
How am I gonna do that?

24:17.853 --> 24:19.285
The resort in Cozumel.

24:19.321 --> 24:20.920
The luxury condo?

24:20.956 --> 24:22.322
I mean, that's all you, right?

24:22.358 --> 24:23.991
Well, I can't take all
the credit for that.

24:23.993 --> 24:25.658
I mean, you know, that's...

24:25.694 --> 24:27.927
It's a team, and we're a family.

24:27.963 --> 24:30.397
And there's no "I" in...
There is an "I" in family.

24:30.433 --> 24:32.332
Carol. Don't be modest.

24:32.368 --> 24:34.067
Since you were never supposed to know

24:34.103 --> 24:35.869
about the fictitious
property in the first place,

24:35.871 --> 24:37.303
she'll start to get nervous.

24:37.339 --> 24:38.505
That's when you tell her

24:38.541 --> 24:40.206
someone is about to buy the resort

24:40.242 --> 24:42.008
for an extremely high price.

24:42.044 --> 24:43.777
Someone wants to buy it?

24:44.747 --> 24:46.012
Who?

24:46.048 --> 24:47.447
Here he is now.

24:47.483 --> 24:48.982
You must be Carol.

24:49.018 --> 24:50.550
Hi. Terry Keaton. Keaton Enterprises.

24:50.586 --> 24:52.752
It is a pleasure to finally meet you.

24:52.788 --> 24:54.721
Mr. Keaton wants to get
into the hotel business,

24:54.757 --> 24:57.356
and he is starting with
your Cozumel resort.

24:57.359 --> 24:59.447
Once you've made the introduction,

24:59.462 --> 25:00.660
I'll play up how excited I am

25:00.696 --> 25:03.830
and the $175 million I'm
offering to purchase it.

25:03.866 --> 25:05.331
There's just one snag.

25:05.367 --> 25:06.533
I'd like to see it.

25:06.569 --> 25:08.405
You want to see the resort?

25:08.408 --> 25:10.336
I'll have my assistant
ready the private jet.

25:10.372 --> 25:12.038
If it's a hassle, we can take my jet.

25:12.074 --> 25:13.139
No, it's not a problem.

25:13.175 --> 25:15.041
I can see you're eager
to close the deal,

25:15.077 --> 25:16.372
and so are we.

25:16.375 --> 25:20.046
Absolutely. I can't wait.

25:20.115 --> 25:22.281
So, if you would just excuse me,

25:22.300 --> 25:26.135
I just need to freshen up
a little bit before we go.

25:26.155 --> 25:28.154
So I'll be back.

25:28.190 --> 25:31.658
When Carol realizes
there's no backing out...

25:31.694 --> 25:33.626
She'll try to make a getaway.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.629
Hi, Carol. Agent Justine Diaz, FBI.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.031
Really?

25:38.067 --> 25:39.132
Yeah.

25:39.168 --> 25:40.433
Crap.

25:40.469 --> 25:41.469
Yeah.

25:41.504 --> 25:43.069
Let's go back inside, have a chat.

25:43.105 --> 25:46.039
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:46.090 --> 25:48.056
So The Cleaner never even saw the body.

25:48.077 --> 25:49.309
Someone must have moved it.

25:49.345 --> 25:51.077
Someone who had access to Rhys' room.

25:51.113 --> 25:53.746
Or Felicity was still alive
enough to call someone.

25:53.782 --> 25:54.704
Impossible.

25:54.707 --> 25:56.549
I shot her from extremely close range,

25:56.585 --> 25:57.684
and I'm an excellent shot.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.094
He's bragging about this.

25:59.097 --> 26:00.586
The British don't brag.

26:00.589 --> 26:02.749
That's an American phenomenon.
I'm just stating a fact.

26:03.493 --> 26:05.225
So, what's next?

26:05.261 --> 26:06.894
We need to find out who
was in that Weatherby

26:06.896 --> 26:08.695
between 9:30 and 11:00 P.M.

26:08.731 --> 26:10.230
Also, any calls that
may have been placed

26:10.232 --> 26:11.598
to or from Rhys' room.

26:11.634 --> 26:12.799
Check the lobby cams, as well.

26:12.801 --> 26:13.867
I won't be able to do that remotely.

26:13.869 --> 26:15.201
I'll need access to the hotel.

26:15.237 --> 26:16.677
Well, Margot can help you with that.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.271
Good. More Margot.

26:18.307 --> 26:19.572
I'm with you there.

26:19.608 --> 26:20.807
I'll go.

26:20.843 --> 26:22.574
It's fine. I got it.

26:24.413 --> 26:26.913
Someone's got a bit of an attitude.

26:26.949 --> 26:29.282
She thought she'd be
putting criminals away here,

26:29.318 --> 26:30.809
not taking orders from them.

26:30.812 --> 26:33.052
Well, then, she's entirely missed

26:33.055 --> 26:35.153
the point of becoming
a detective, hasn't she?

26:35.156 --> 26:36.055
How's that?

26:36.058 --> 26:39.359
People hire you to find out the truth.

26:39.395 --> 26:41.528
And the truth and justice

26:41.564 --> 26:44.197
have absolutely nothing
to do with one another.

26:46.969 --> 26:49.736
Have you got everything?
Taser, zip ties?

26:49.772 --> 26:51.104
And the gun.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.739
Good girl. All right, let's go.

26:52.775 --> 26:55.309
Danny's got the car ready.

26:56.579 --> 26:57.510
Who is it?

26:57.546 --> 26:58.579
It's Sophie.

27:01.350 --> 27:02.715
Why didn't you call?

27:02.751 --> 27:05.567
I called Danny. I
thought he was with you.

27:05.570 --> 27:06.986
He's downstairs in the car.

27:07.022 --> 27:08.022
You're going somewhere?

27:08.057 --> 27:09.923
We're running an errand. Can I help you?

27:09.959 --> 27:11.624
We got a potential lead on Felicity.

27:11.660 --> 27:12.725
Do you know where she is?

27:12.761 --> 27:14.794
No, but we're close to figuring out

27:14.830 --> 27:17.230
how she survived and
who she's working with.

27:17.266 --> 27:18.386
So what do you need from me?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.967
Access to the Weatherby's servers.

27:24.139 --> 27:27.006
I'll type the password for you.

27:30.412 --> 27:32.546
If I were you, I'd
stay out of the photos.

27:33.549 --> 27:35.048
And the e-mail.

27:36.619 --> 27:38.685
And the texts.

27:38.721 --> 27:40.420
I know you're sleeping with him.

27:41.857 --> 27:43.924
Just please try to not get him killed.

27:45.361 --> 27:46.526
How long do you need?

27:48.397 --> 27:50.496
Could be a few hours.

27:50.532 --> 27:52.532
We'll be back in two.

27:52.568 --> 27:53.834
All of us.

28:03.178 --> 28:04.644
Tessa? We good?

28:04.680 --> 28:05.680
Just fine.

28:05.714 --> 28:07.814
We're not going anywhere, are we?

28:08.984 --> 28:10.783
Danny.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.285
I'm in position.

28:12.321 --> 28:14.854
Yeah, change of plan.

28:14.890 --> 28:16.750
- I want you to go and get the car.
- Why?

28:16.753 --> 28:18.017
Take Tessa back to the hotel.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.052
What?!

28:19.055 --> 28:20.023
It's far too dangerous.

28:20.026 --> 28:21.595
This is about what
Sophie said, isn't it?

28:21.597 --> 28:22.929
Wait, what did Sophie say?

28:22.965 --> 28:24.964
She thinks Mum is gonna get you killed.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.132
Yeah, and for good reason.

28:26.168 --> 28:28.234
Just... Danny, get the
car and take Tessa back.

28:28.270 --> 28:29.335
I'm not leaving you here.

28:29.371 --> 28:30.771
Well, then stay out of
sight... Both of you.

28:30.773 --> 28:32.406
I've got this.

28:33.642 --> 28:35.708
I can sign for that.

28:39.882 --> 28:42.281
I can take care of myself.

28:42.317 --> 28:44.184
I'm fine.

28:45.220 --> 28:47.521
Where the hell did he come from?

28:49.214 --> 28:51.426
See, this is why I don't date.

29:03.629 --> 29:04.995
What did you do?

29:05.031 --> 29:06.063
I shot him.

29:06.098 --> 29:07.931
What did I say about staying inside?

29:07.967 --> 29:10.674
Far too much. And you're welcome.

29:12.772 --> 29:16.673
Tell the Mockingbird if
he wants his shipment back,

29:16.709 --> 29:19.209
he can reach me at that number.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.380
- Give me those.
- I'm coming with you.

29:23.416 --> 29:25.102
No. You're not.

29:26.252 --> 29:27.951
You're fired.

29:27.954 --> 29:28.818
What?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.985
I no longer have need of your services.

29:34.527 --> 29:35.625
You shot him.

29:35.661 --> 29:38.228
Yeah. He was gonna shoot you.

29:39.999 --> 29:42.332
Well, you know, the good
thing about being fired

29:42.368 --> 29:44.968
is that you don't have
to tell Human Resources

29:45.004 --> 29:46.469
that you're dating your boss.

29:51.019 --> 29:52.919
Come along, stepdad.

29:54.323 --> 29:57.189
These drugs aren't gonna drive
themselves to a secret location.

29:57.225 --> 29:59.592
Step-dad?

29:59.628 --> 30:01.261
It's better than henchman.

30:11.640 --> 30:12.640
Okay.

30:12.674 --> 30:14.040
I'll tell you everything,

30:14.076 --> 30:15.675
but it's not like I'm the only one.

30:15.711 --> 30:18.945
Joe Vernon's been padding
his time card for years.

30:18.981 --> 30:21.781
And Jamie Yarsky is sleeping
with Kathleen O'Neill.

30:21.817 --> 30:24.350
Carol. The Cozumel resort.

30:25.687 --> 30:26.687
Right. Sorry.

30:26.722 --> 30:27.954
Tell us how you did it.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.722
Well, about a month ago,

30:29.758 --> 30:32.058
I-I got a manila envelope on my desk

30:32.094 --> 30:33.392
with $10,000 in it.

30:33.428 --> 30:36.529
Like crisp, brand-new bills
with all the instructions.

30:36.565 --> 30:37.663
What kind of instructions?

30:37.699 --> 30:40.700
How to make a resort on paper.

30:40.736 --> 30:43.369
How to move money
through the corporation.

30:43.405 --> 30:45.304
So you just did it?

30:45.340 --> 30:47.039
The instructions said that if I did it,

30:47.075 --> 30:48.708
I'd get the same envelope every week,

30:48.744 --> 30:50.676
and you know that I
love working for you,

30:50.712 --> 30:52.378
but you don't pay me enough.

30:52.414 --> 30:53.846
- I...
- And Jamie Yarsky

30:53.882 --> 30:56.215
makes way more than
me, and you know why.

30:56.251 --> 30:59.418
Carol... Sexism in the workplace.

31:00.897 --> 31:03.397
And, you know, I could sue.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.025
Do you know who sends you the envelopes

31:06.061 --> 31:07.193
or where they come from?

31:07.229 --> 31:08.995
They just show up on my desk.

31:09.031 --> 31:10.530
What about the money
you've been laundering?

31:10.532 --> 31:12.021
It has to come from somewhere.

31:12.024 --> 31:14.266
Well, it does. It's... There's a trust.

31:14.302 --> 31:15.835
What's the name of the trust?

31:15.871 --> 31:19.873
It's, um...

31:21.109 --> 31:22.742
It's a Carly Simon song.

31:22.778 --> 31:23.709
It's the one...

31:23.745 --> 31:25.711
She sings it with, James Taylor.

31:25.747 --> 31:27.146
Um...

31:27.182 --> 31:29.515
Um... "Mockingbird!"

31:29.551 --> 31:31.685
The Mockingbird Trust.

31:33.035 --> 31:34.920
Not a bad racket you've got here.

31:34.956 --> 31:37.223
Send the minions out
to do the grunt work

31:37.259 --> 31:40.426
while you keep the
bourbon industry alive.

31:40.462 --> 31:43.462
I rather enjoy being the
Poirot to your Miss Marple.

31:43.498 --> 31:47.299
As much as you enjoy
pretending to be an FBI agent?

31:47.335 --> 31:49.135
"Criminal Informant."

31:49.171 --> 31:51.204
That's the official title.

31:51.239 --> 31:53.472
Although, I admit, it
lacks a certain sparkle.

31:53.508 --> 31:56.809
The criminal part suits you.

31:56.845 --> 31:58.244
The rest, I'm not buying.

31:59.548 --> 32:02.548
I think working for my sister's
made you rather cynical.

32:02.584 --> 32:03.849
So, when we find Felicity,

32:03.885 --> 32:05.253
you're not gonna try to kill her?

32:05.256 --> 32:07.219
Try? No.

32:07.255 --> 32:10.890
So, why waste time playing the good guy?

32:10.926 --> 32:13.759
I know why Ben's doing it,
but what's your end game?

32:13.795 --> 32:18.097
Well, if I told you I didn't have one,

32:18.133 --> 32:19.331
you wouldn't believe me.

32:19.367 --> 32:23.069
And if I had one, why on
Earth would I tell you?

32:25.707 --> 32:28.274
It's a shame.

32:28.310 --> 32:29.842
I'd love to like you.

32:29.878 --> 32:32.645
You do like me. That's the problem.

32:34.393 --> 32:35.559
Ben loves me.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.918
So, why can't you be more like Ben?

32:38.954 --> 32:42.088
What, because he's good now?

32:42.124 --> 32:43.756
Is that what you think?

32:45.861 --> 32:48.260
Let me tell you something.

32:48.296 --> 32:52.364
Ben is exactly like me.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.467
He's just better at hiding it.

32:56.071 --> 32:58.204
Before, maybe.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.474
Before when? This morning?

33:01.510 --> 33:04.176
When he asked me to break in
to your ex-fiance's office?

33:04.212 --> 33:07.147
He asked you to break
into Ethan's office?

33:08.583 --> 33:09.849
Why?

33:12.521 --> 33:15.721
Because a tiger cannot
change his stripes.

33:15.757 --> 33:21.027
And you, my dear, fell
in love with a tiger.

33:23.832 --> 33:26.298
When you find Felicity, let me know.

33:26.334 --> 33:28.067
I'll take care of the rest.

33:31.206 --> 33:33.839
So, is this how it works?

33:33.875 --> 33:36.176
You knock 'em down,
Agent Diaz puts 'em away?

33:37.417 --> 33:38.944
Something like that.

33:38.980 --> 33:41.680
How much longer they got you doing this?

33:41.716 --> 33:42.849
A couple months.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.319
Well, you saved my ass today.

33:49.524 --> 33:50.689
I didn't want to.

33:50.725 --> 33:52.825
But you did it anyway.

33:52.861 --> 33:56.328
I didn't do it for
you. I did it for Alice.

33:56.364 --> 33:57.864
So you two can work together.

33:58.934 --> 34:00.666
I assumed she was turning me down.

34:00.702 --> 34:02.168
I haven't heard from her.

34:02.204 --> 34:04.270
You will.

34:05.190 --> 34:06.221
Look, Ben...

34:06.224 --> 34:07.740
It's all right.

34:07.776 --> 34:09.074
We don't have to be friends.

34:09.110 --> 34:10.141
Thank God.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.077
I know, right?

34:14.416 --> 34:16.815
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:16.851 --> 34:18.884
I let myself in.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.620
That's why I gave you the key.

34:27.462 --> 34:29.018
I was just leaving.

34:29.029 --> 34:31.571
No, don't go on my account.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.665
No, it's okay.

34:32.701 --> 34:35.668
I think we were just about done.

34:36.871 --> 34:39.038
You know, I was thinking...

34:39.074 --> 34:41.473
If it's okay with you,

34:41.509 --> 34:43.743
maybe it's best if we
don't work together.

34:47.081 --> 34:49.081
Is that okay?

34:50.418 --> 34:52.184
Yes. Of course.

34:52.219 --> 34:53.553
I totally get it.

34:55.556 --> 34:56.989
Thanks.

34:59.995 --> 35:03.263
See you, guys.

35:10.063 --> 35:11.162
What did you do?

35:14.609 --> 35:16.775
Ethan.

35:16.811 --> 35:18.677
I'm sorry.

35:18.713 --> 35:20.679
It's just that if Ben said
something or did something...

35:20.681 --> 35:22.585
He didn't. No, he's been great.

35:24.119 --> 35:26.819
He is great.

35:26.855 --> 35:29.622
And he is very much in love with you.

35:34.095 --> 35:36.296
Which is why you and I
shouldn't work together.

35:40.535 --> 35:42.534
Because I'm still in love with you.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.380
I'm sorry, Allie.

36:11.669 --> 36:12.997
You okay?

36:13.033 --> 36:15.033
What happened here today?

36:15.069 --> 36:16.634
Nothing. I swear.

36:16.670 --> 36:17.769
No.

36:19.406 --> 36:20.605
Last night, you hated him.

36:20.641 --> 36:22.273
You begged me not to work with him.

36:22.309 --> 36:24.632
Tonight, you're having drinks,
and now he just fired me.

36:24.635 --> 36:27.012
- Okay. In my defense...
- Mnh-mnh.

36:29.318 --> 36:32.433
Tell me what happened.

36:33.954 --> 36:35.887
Is this the woman I'm dating?

36:35.923 --> 36:37.489
Have you told Alice yet?

36:37.525 --> 36:39.724
That's a no.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.894
Do me a favor and take a
photo of her face when you do.

36:44.441 --> 36:46.224
Any word from the
mysterious Mockingbird?

36:46.227 --> 36:47.793
Yes.

36:47.796 --> 36:50.168
I'm actually on my way to meet him now.

36:50.204 --> 36:51.736
- By yourself?
- Don't worry.

36:51.772 --> 36:54.073
I've taken all the
necessary precautions.

36:54.076 --> 36:55.880
I'll leave right now.
I'll meet you there.

36:55.883 --> 36:58.120
You'll be in my hotel
room when I get back.

36:58.123 --> 37:00.278
I'll tell the guards to expect you.

37:00.298 --> 37:03.665
Okay. It's a date.

37:05.219 --> 37:08.586
Yes. I suppose it is.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.512
Are you nearly done?

37:12.548 --> 37:14.514
I am.

37:14.550 --> 37:16.546
Yet you're still here.

37:24.496 --> 37:25.759
Why don't you come with me?

37:26.795 --> 37:28.361
W-Why in God's name would I do that?

37:28.397 --> 37:29.696
Because Felicity's out there

37:29.732 --> 37:31.731
plotting the death of your entire family

37:31.767 --> 37:33.566
and knows you're here
and you're a target.

37:33.602 --> 37:35.802
Aww. And... And you're
gonna keep me safe?

37:35.838 --> 37:37.337
We can put you in the security wing.

37:37.373 --> 37:41.140
You think criminals can't get to AVI?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.508
My mother runs the place.

37:42.544 --> 37:43.943
My uncle's there now.

37:43.979 --> 37:46.179
Besides, wouldn't your
life be so much better

37:46.215 --> 37:49.249
if Felicity walked in
here and shot me and Mum?

37:49.285 --> 37:51.184
You'd never have to see us again.

37:53.555 --> 37:55.154
It doesn't mean I want you dead.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.789
Well, you're not staying.

37:56.825 --> 37:59.592
There's the door. You're dismissed.

37:59.628 --> 38:02.428
Fine.

38:02.471 --> 38:05.071
I'm just gonna make sure
the guards know to...

38:14.944 --> 38:17.196
Now... you're coming with me.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.432
No. No.

38:41.170 --> 38:42.903
911, what's your emergency?

38:42.905 --> 38:43.870
I have a gunshot victim.

38:43.906 --> 38:45.138
Female. 30 years old.

38:45.174 --> 38:48.508
GSW to the lower abdomen
at the Weatherby Downtown...

38:57.987 --> 38:59.085
How is she?

38:59.121 --> 39:00.553
She's still in surgery.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.989
The doctors are gonna let us
know the minute she gets out.

39:03.025 --> 39:04.457
What about Margot? Where is she?

39:04.460 --> 39:06.492
She's at a meeting. She's
not picking up her phone.

39:06.495 --> 39:07.460
Is she with Tessa?

39:07.496 --> 39:10.263
No. She left Tessa back.

39:10.299 --> 39:11.464
My God.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.266
I'll be back.

39:14.903 --> 39:16.336
Alice, I'm sorry.

39:16.372 --> 39:17.837
I'm so sorry.

39:17.873 --> 39:19.180
It's gonna be fine.

39:20.302 --> 39:22.008
Benji. Your timing is impeccable.

39:22.044 --> 39:23.943
I was just about to order dinner.

39:23.979 --> 39:25.678
Why didn't you tell me about Felicity?

39:26.782 --> 39:28.815
- I take it you've seen Alice.
- Rhys.

39:28.818 --> 39:30.840
I didn't tell you because I
didn't want to drag you into it.

39:30.842 --> 39:32.085
Well, I am in it now.

39:32.121 --> 39:33.219
What are you talking about?

39:33.255 --> 39:34.787
- She's taken Tessa.
- What?

39:34.823 --> 39:37.223
Benji, I'm so sorry.

39:37.259 --> 39:38.324
I-I didn't think...

39:38.360 --> 39:39.525
You never do.

39:39.561 --> 39:41.227
But you are gonna start right now,

39:41.263 --> 39:43.096
and you are gonna help me get her back.

39:43.132 --> 39:45.231
This is my fault.

39:45.267 --> 39:46.267
- Allie.
- No, it's not.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.134
She didn't want to go to Margot's.

39:48.170 --> 39:49.202
I made her go.

39:49.230 --> 39:52.152
You volunteered to go in her place.

39:52.163 --> 39:53.295
She chose to go.

39:53.298 --> 39:54.607
She was doing her job.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.209
I'm the one who forced us

39:56.245 --> 39:58.444
to take Margot Bishop on as a client.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.979
- You didn't...
- You didn't force us.

40:00.015 --> 40:01.114
We needed the money.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.750
We all agreed.

40:03.786 --> 40:05.251
Which makes it my fault.

40:05.287 --> 40:06.487
- Danny...
- What?

40:06.490 --> 40:08.021
You found her.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.489
You probably saved her life.

40:09.525 --> 40:12.777
Yeah, but she tried to warn
me, and I didn't listen.

40:12.780 --> 40:14.427
Warn you about what?

40:17.299 --> 40:20.466
It probably isn't a good
time to tell you this,

40:20.502 --> 40:23.770
but, um...

40:23.806 --> 40:27.640
I'm kind of... dating Margot.

40:41.056 --> 40:43.123
Sorry to keep you waiting.

40:45.294 --> 40:47.326
You must be the Mockingbird.

40:47.362 --> 40:52.099
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Ms. Bishop.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.600
Now, um...

40:58.207 --> 41:00.773
Where are all those drugs
that you stole from me?
