It won't open!

00:07.231 --> 00:11.039
We must escape before we
reach the fields. Isabelle?

00:11.101 --> 00:14.758
They've taken the book, and with it our
powers. What would you have me do?

00:15.027 --> 00:19.098
- Anything, we're running out of time!
- Time is the one thing we do have.

00:19.302 --> 00:21.769
If we fall this night, I promise you...

00:22.315 --> 00:24.599
We will rise again to finish our quest.

Magistrate Wilkins...

01:24.518 --> 01:26.892
Come to enjoy your handywork?

01:28.866 --> 01:31.975
Give me the 3 stones of power, countess.

01:32.197 --> 01:35.163
You may yet escape the pyre's flames.

01:36.001 --> 01:39.966
My book.
There's a page marked.

01:45.658 --> 01:47.900
What means this?

01:50.252 --> 01:53.617
It means that the stones of power
shall be mine.

01:53.721 --> 01:57.272
And once I possess them, you shall
tremble at my feet.

01:57.346 --> 02:00.247
And never again persecute my kind.

No, please... Have Mercy!

Countess Marguerite Isabelle Thoreaux.

02:34.094 --> 02:38.978
You have been found guilty of committing
the darkest art... Witchcraft.

02:39.132 --> 02:44.041
For this affront against God, I hereby
condemn you to burn in the fires of hell.

02:44.767 --> 02:47.789
Of which you so eagerly
seek communion.

02:59.669 --> 03:02.964
You think this ends with a lick of flame?

03:03.882 --> 03:05.783
I sleep but a while...

03:06.144 --> 03:10.381
And when the time is appointed,
my heir will awaken me...

03:10.559 --> 03:13.384
And I will have vengeance!

03:35.351 --> 03:37.859
So, you found it on 'E-bay'?

03:38.017 --> 03:41.063
Yeah, this old guy in Nice was
auctioning it off.

03:41.811 --> 03:45.058
I had to max-out my entire credit card
to get it...

03:45.092 --> 03:48.533
But I couldn't resist, it was like
it was calling to me.

03:55.019 --> 03:59.414
The spell-book of Countess Isabelle
Marguerite Thoreaux.

03:59.562 --> 04:02.381
Those look like the same symbols
in the cave.

04:02.572 --> 04:03.871
Yeah.

04:03.909 --> 04:07.687
Maybe it will help explain what happened
in Paris when I touched Isabelle's tomb.

04:07.786 --> 04:11.133
And the tattoo,
and the missing 12 hours...

04:13.172 --> 04:15.236
So, how's your Latin?

04:15.378 --> 04:19.293
About as good as my Italian, which...
I don't speak.

04:27.524 --> 04:29.722
Oh, I'll get it.

04:30.914 --> 04:33.393
- Oh my God...
- What?

04:33.986 --> 04:36.851
This is the symbol from Isabelle's tomb.

04:36.914 --> 04:38.855
That's kind of spooky.

05:02.248 --> 05:03.922
You O.K.?

05:16.578 --> 05:19.039
Never been better.

06:27.075 --> 06:30.600
Hey Lois, what are you doing here,
why aren't you in school?

06:30.605 --> 06:33.730
We're having a surprise party for Chloe's
18th birthday in your barn, remember?

06:33.736 --> 06:36.886
No, I remember telling you you couldn't
have it here.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.641
Too late now! Everyone's already been
invited, and you

06:39.733 --> 06:42.653
really don't want it getting back to Chloe
that you rained on her shindig,

06:42.655 --> 06:44.120
That would hurt her feelings.

06:44.135 --> 06:47.256
- What?
- Then I'd have to hurt you.

06:48.195 --> 06:50.890
- Listen, Lois, I don't wanna.
- Would you give me a hand with these,

06:50.894 --> 06:53.139
I have to get the wheels back to my dad
before he realizes they're missing.

06:53.145 --> 06:55.996
Lois, we can't do this tonight, the guy
from Princeton's coming to meet me.

06:56.042 --> 07:00.483
- Besides, my parents are out of town.
- Relax, 'Smallville. ' It's just going

07:00.489 --> 07:03.328
to be a couple of people, standing around
singing 'Happy Birthday.'

07:03.388 --> 07:06.915
It's not going to be Sodom and Gomorrah.
Mr. Ivy League won't even know we're here.

07:06.966 --> 07:08.224
Trust me.

07:30.024 --> 07:32.845
Hair of 2 virgins.

07:34.965 --> 07:38.483
Ha, we've been a good little
girl, haven't we?

07:42.728 --> 07:47.221
Hello? Oh, you are home. I've been
calling, but no one answered.

07:50.596 --> 07:54.372
Well, I've been kind of preoccupied.
Science project.

07:54.964 --> 07:56.858
From what century?

07:57.643 --> 08:02.532
It's a whole retro thing. Trying to
recreate some stuff they did in the 1600s.

08:03.276 --> 08:04.587
Oh.

08:06.718 --> 08:10.391
I really think you two are going
to like it.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.573
Damn. I left my phone in your
car. Do you mind?

08:13.611 --> 08:17.020
Oh no, no worries. This smell of science
is making me crave

08:17.114 --> 08:20.951
and aromatic latte anyway, so I'll just
meet you downstairs with your cell phone.

08:21.027 --> 08:23.433
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks!

08:27.076 --> 08:29.796
What's the matter with you? You were
supposed to take Chloe shopping,

08:29.811 --> 08:31.913
so that I could finish everything
with the party?

08:31.954 --> 08:34.267
Right. Must have slipped my mind.

08:34.302 --> 08:38.572
Wow. Get some traction. 'Little Miss
Reporter' there? She can smell a ruse

08:38.659 --> 08:42.559
a mile away. I'm going to need some
serious help to keep her from ferreting

08:42.647 --> 08:45.066
out whatever it is we're planning tonight.
Ow!

08:48.189 --> 08:53.625
- Oh no, no, that's no good.
- Well yeah, not since you pulled it out!

08:53.695 --> 08:57.251
- It was grey.
- I don't have grey hair.

09:02.213 --> 09:06.028
I'm just going to use your
bathroom for a second.

09:17.352 --> 09:21.197
7. Hair of 2 virgins
8. Oil of Mushroom.

09:36.231 --> 09:39.007
Maybe you need a woman's touch.

09:41.110 --> 09:43.091
Hey. Lana.

09:43.427 --> 09:45.121
Hello Clark.

09:47.669 --> 09:49.355
It's a big box.

09:52.063 --> 09:55.461
It's a gift for Chloe. Lois and I
got it for her.

09:55.475 --> 09:59.825
I'm sure that she'll love it.
Especially if it's from you.

10:01.338 --> 10:05.803
Look, I'm glad you're here. I wanted to
talk to you about what happened with Jason.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.447
Oh don't worry about it.

10:08.665 --> 10:14.832
It's water...
under a very tall bridge.

10:19.392 --> 10:21.840
Are you feeling O.K.?

10:21.925 --> 10:25.333
You seem a little...
different.

10:26.774 --> 10:29.206
Maybe it's the company.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.004
Jason's my friend.

10:40.223 --> 10:43.257
Well, he doesn't think so...

10:47.172 --> 10:49.357
Hey! What you doing?

10:51.028 --> 10:54.068
I wanted a lock of your hair for a
scrapbook I'm making for Chloe's birthday.

10:54.858 --> 10:57.125
Well all you had to do was ask!

10:57.160 --> 10:59.457
Well where's the fun in that?

11:02.531 --> 11:04.475
What happened to these?

11:04.564 --> 11:07.281
They were broken already.

11:09.098 --> 11:10.914
Here, is that enough?

11:16.336 --> 11:18.233
It's perfect.

11:18.964 --> 11:20.636
Thanks, handsome.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.280
You play beautifully.

11:55.971 --> 11:59.118
Thanks, but I'm afraid
I'm a little rusty.

11:59.189 --> 12:01.952
Well I hate to interrupt, but...

12:02.046 --> 12:04.448
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

12:04.535 --> 12:07.525
Have I ever been able to refuse
Lana Lang?

12:09.724 --> 12:11.574
What do you need?

12:11.604 --> 12:14.839
Oh, a good bottle of wine for
Chloe's birthday.

12:14.914 --> 12:18.365
The last time I checked, she wasn't
turning 21 yet.

12:18.374 --> 12:23.288
I know, but I thought it'd be nice to raise
a glass with her and Lois to celebrate.

12:24.947 --> 12:28.276
I promise I won't tell anyone
where I got it from.

12:30.877 --> 12:33.025
It'll be our little secret.

12:35.491 --> 12:40.104
Well, I think I might have a light Riesling
that won't do too much damage.

12:43.776 --> 12:48.554
Actually I was looking for more a vintage
Merlot from the South of France.

12:48.583 --> 12:52.487
Something from the vineyard in the Londoc
or possibly the Doldogne,

12:52.585 --> 12:54.395
that should do in a pinch.

12:54.682 --> 12:58.693
Well, your tastes have certainly matured
from a summer in Paris.

12:58.725 --> 13:01.146
Just give me a second.

13:08.387 --> 13:12.014
1902, from the Salgier vineyards
in Londoc.

13:12.476 --> 13:14.972
It should make quite
the birthday present.

13:14.996 --> 13:16.582
What is this?

13:17.773 --> 13:21.071
Just a little something I picked up in
St. Petersburg.

13:21.088 --> 13:23.492
It's an illuminated manuscript, depicting
the ancient...

13:23.494 --> 13:24.385
You're lying...

13:25.923 --> 13:26.986
What?

13:27.677 --> 13:32.121
You know its true nature, but the map
was not meant for you.

13:32.355 --> 13:35.946
Lana, how did you know there's a
map hidden under the page?

13:36.136 --> 13:37.707
Because...

13:42.700 --> 13:45.484
- [Latin]
- Lana, what did you do?

13:49.978 --> 13:53.198
You seek the stones, don't you?

13:58.058 --> 14:00.581
Well, we can't have that.

14:01.786 --> 14:06.236
I think that you're right, Alexander,
you do need more practice.

14:07.157 --> 14:11.086
Keep playing... 'Infinitas'.

14:45.525 --> 14:49.525
[Latin]

15:03.416 --> 15:07.288
O.K. What are we doing in the woods?
Chloe's right behind me, and the moonlight

15:07.317 --> 15:10.215
nature hike, it's making her
a little suspicious.

15:10.263 --> 15:13.276
I thought it'd be nice to get together
with my girls before the party.

15:13.376 --> 15:15.045
What party?

15:15.427 --> 15:17.656
Way to ruin the surprise.

15:17.719 --> 15:21.564
Oh you mean the party that you've been
planning for the last month?

15:21.581 --> 15:23.115
You knew about that?

15:23.145 --> 15:27.544
'Hello!' Investigative Reporter, nothing
gets past me! Except...

15:27.607 --> 15:32.611
why we're playing 'Wood Nymph' when there's
a party waiting for me with my name on it.

15:33.277 --> 15:35.656
Then we'd better hurry.

15:42.406 --> 15:45.803
A toast. In honor of this special night.

15:45.835 --> 15:48.803
Alright. This is getting better.

15:50.186 --> 15:55.187
No matter how much time passes...
old friends are never forgotten.

15:56.585 --> 15:58.564
I'll drink to that.

15:59.831 --> 16:01.482
Cheers.

16:26.316 --> 16:27.788
Madeline?

16:30.131 --> 16:31.954
Brianna?

16:33.772 --> 16:36.768
Welcome to the 21st century.

16:36.783 --> 16:38.512
How did we come to be here?

16:38.517 --> 16:42.708
The last spell I cast before Wilkins
condemned me to the Pyre.

16:42.749 --> 16:46.697
My blood entwined with a symbol in the
book which called to my heir.

16:47.267 --> 16:51.699
And when she touched it, I gained
possession of her body.

16:52.681 --> 16:54.607
And brought you back.

16:54.612 --> 16:57.850
I'm gorgeous! Look at these!

16:59.087 --> 17:01.326
Yes, they're very nice.

17:01.340 --> 17:06.262
Ah, the woods of France.
I'd know them anywhere.

17:06.564 --> 17:09.123
We're in Kansas, Madeline.

17:09.234 --> 17:11.709
- Where?
- The Americas.

17:11.727 --> 17:16.876
I am unsure as to why I was resurrected
here, it was not my intention, but...

17:16.926 --> 17:19.877
The book! Do you have it?

17:27.042 --> 17:31.301
It is ours once again.
And with it our magics...

17:31.616 --> 17:34.324
Now we may continue our quest
for the stones...

17:34.764 --> 17:38.544
Is that the same quest that got us
burned at the stake?

17:38.579 --> 17:40.475
That was not pleasant.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.785
A small toll to travel the road of
ultimate power.

17:45.752 --> 17:49.858
You have your hosts' memories, use
them to navigate this world...

17:49.954 --> 17:53.193
And help us to seize the power!

18:00.957 --> 18:03.896
HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHLOE

18:13.939 --> 18:16.425
Hey, Jason, do you know where the girls are,
they were supposed to be here 1 hour ago.

18:16.472 --> 18:17.851
No I'm sorry.

18:21.148 --> 18:24.227
- Look, Jason.
- Clark, I'm only here because Lana

18:24.276 --> 18:26.300
wants me to be here.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.310
Because I'm her boyfriend.
Whether you like it or not.

18:52.311 --> 18:53.725
We don't have time for this.

18:53.726 --> 18:56.189
Time is the only thing we do have.

18:56.224 --> 18:59.117
Isn't that what you said before the angry
mob set us on fire?

18:59.164 --> 19:02.007
You're really not going to let
that go, are you?

19:06.620 --> 19:09.125
The guy from Princeton's going to be
here any minute,

19:09.161 --> 19:10.836
why are you so late?

19:10.847 --> 19:12.863
I took the scenic route.

19:14.844 --> 19:17.008
Love the view.

19:19.319 --> 19:21.674
Have you been drinking?

19:24.529 --> 19:28.918
So, I don't want to be rude but I think
I'm just going to tell Chloe Happy Birthday

19:28.979 --> 19:32.068
- and take off.
- You're a big boy. You can do what you want.

19:32.158 --> 19:35.655
- You're the one who wanted me here.
- Well, things change.

19:35.904 --> 19:39.849
Why are you acting like this?
And why are you dressed like that?

19:40.992 --> 19:43.830
Because it makes me feel sexy.

19:46.265 --> 19:48.736
Weren't you leaving?

19:58.090 --> 20:02.771
- The food is so good in this century!
- And the men actually bathe.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.334
And the bodies are so hard!

20:07.409 --> 20:11.453
But we have definitely had better
celebrations. This is appalling.

20:11.546 --> 20:13.294
We could change that.

20:15.689 --> 20:20.596
Well it has been 400 years. Perhaps a
little fun before we continue our quest.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.899
[Latin]

20:46.244 --> 20:47.598
Clark?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.734
Where's Clark Kent?

21:14.628 --> 21:16.318
Clark!

21:18.637 --> 21:19.982
Clark!

21:21.447 --> 21:24.546
Mr. Jacobs. Princeton University?

21:25.581 --> 21:29.313
Hey, come on in, join the party!
Woooo!

22:00.765 --> 22:05.100
Hey, mom!
How was Metropolis?

22:06.774 --> 22:10.699
Really. I'm glad you're having
a great time.

22:12.484 --> 22:14.219
What?

22:14.596 --> 22:17.309
Oh yeah, the guy from Princeton.

22:17.838 --> 22:20.145
I met him last night. I, uh...

22:20.744 --> 22:25.287
Don't worry...
I think I made an impression.

22:29.922 --> 22:33.716
Lex. Can I talk to you for a second?
I've got a big problem.

22:33.740 --> 22:37.223
I was supposed to meet this alumni from
Princeton last night, but then...

22:37.232 --> 22:41.554
Lois wanted to throw a party for Chloe in
the barn, the party kind of got out of hand,

22:41.565 --> 22:46.541
then the guy from Princeton showed up, and
I think I blew it. Look, I hate to ask you,

22:46.577 --> 22:49.018
but do you have any connections
at Princeton?

22:54.317 --> 22:55.670
Lex?

23:02.846 --> 23:04.779
Lex, what are you doing?

23:10.674 --> 23:12.308
Stop!

23:12.693 --> 23:15.140
- Stop it!
- I can't!

23:18.144 --> 23:21.552
- Lex, what happened?
- Lana...

23:34.248 --> 23:37.568
You really shouldn't play with that.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.994
You might hurt yourself.

23:40.053 --> 23:43.315
I heard you and the girls were the
life of the party last night.

23:43.339 --> 23:48.041
One last fling before I finish what
I started a long time ago.

23:49.780 --> 23:52.460
You don't want to get in my way.

23:52.469 --> 23:54.276
Who are you?

23:54.786 --> 23:56.903
[French]

23:58.177 --> 24:02.296
- Isabelle?
- In the new flesh.

24:04.246 --> 24:06.711
What did you do with Lana?

24:06.777 --> 24:09.184
She's in here somewhere.

24:09.232 --> 24:11.138
Could you let her out?

24:13.699 --> 24:17.314
Now why on Earth would I
ever do that?

24:21.545 --> 24:24.797
You know all this started when Lana
found this book.

24:25.912 --> 24:28.855
So I'm guessing if anything happens
to this book...

24:31.770 --> 24:35.608
You have no idea what you're dealing
with, Little Man...

24:35.668 --> 24:37.047
[Latin]

24:41.914 --> 24:44.993
So now you begin to understand...

24:45.258 --> 24:48.053
You're not but an insect in my path...

24:48.118 --> 24:52.113
One to be crushed on the journey
toward greater things.

24:58.515 --> 25:00.192
Lana, no!

25:06.057 --> 25:08.569
Jason! Are you O.K.?

25:15.058 --> 25:19.154
THE BARN... MIDNIGHT

25:29.999 --> 25:32.056
You're early.

25:32.398 --> 25:35.372
Not planning something devious,
are you Clark?

25:35.410 --> 25:37.624
What did you do to Lex and Jason?

25:37.659 --> 25:41.621
Nothing, compared to what we're going
to do to you...

25:42.196 --> 25:43.996
[Latin]

26:01.083 --> 26:05.079
I don't know what's going on, but this
needs to stop, before it gets out of hand.

26:05.137 --> 26:07.398
So, you're more than just fast.

26:07.408 --> 26:10.032
That will make this
a whole lot more exciting.

26:15.371 --> 26:17.130
[Latin]

26:30.756 --> 26:33.284
I don't want to hurt anyone.

26:33.850 --> 26:36.473
Your magics are impressive.

26:36.676 --> 26:38.137
Magic?

26:38.404 --> 26:40.993
But so are mine.

26:41.149 --> 26:43.252
[Latin]

26:49.431 --> 26:53.822
We have traveled through the ages to
complete our quest.

26:53.827 --> 26:59.178
I wouldn't doubt this now - We will not
be undone my a farm boy with a few tricks.

27:04.286 --> 27:07.236
He's not what he seems, Isabelle.

27:07.321 --> 27:11.551
- I can feel his power.
- Then perhaps we should rid him of it.

27:13.192 --> 27:16.145
Chloe, you've got to help.

27:17.693 --> 27:20.737
- I know you're in there.
- Clark?

27:20.809 --> 27:23.313
Listen to me, you've got
to help me.

27:37.059 --> 27:41.059
[Latin]

28:01.666 --> 28:03.639
It is done.

28:03.736 --> 28:06.591
His powers are gone.

28:28.723 --> 28:30.907
He awakens.

28:33.269 --> 28:34.789
What have you done to me?

28:34.792 --> 28:37.900
We made sure you're no longer a
threat... Sorcerer.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.343
I'm not a sorcerer.

28:40.575 --> 28:42.059
You're not?

28:42.632 --> 28:44.083
Are you sure?

28:44.092 --> 28:47.541
No. He's something else.

28:48.043 --> 28:50.444
Something special.

28:51.350 --> 28:55.696
I could sense it when your magics
were ripped from your body.

28:57.639 --> 29:00.620
I can taste it on you.

29:01.967 --> 29:04.561
The 3 stones of power...

29:05.641 --> 29:08.507
You know of them, don't you?

29:08.577 --> 29:10.706
I've never heard of them.

29:14.696 --> 29:17.284
You've done more than hear them...

29:17.323 --> 29:19.248
You've touched them.

29:19.384 --> 29:21.492
We can feel it.

29:21.576 --> 29:23.628
There's more.

29:23.904 --> 29:27.443
You know where one of them is hidden.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.815
Tell us where it is, Clark.

29:31.946 --> 29:34.054
Please tell us.

29:34.066 --> 29:36.639
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:37.322 --> 29:39.891
Let me cut it out of him...

29:39.960 --> 29:41.661
No!

29:44.241 --> 29:48.833
There are easier ways
to get what we want.

29:53.149 --> 29:56.297
This body I inhabit...

29:57.053 --> 30:00.782
You have desires for it, don't you?

30:04.856 --> 30:08.351
Well it desires you too, Clark.

30:08.515 --> 30:12.262
Very...
very much.

30:20.754 --> 30:22.658
[Latin]

30:39.104 --> 30:42.150
THE... CAVE...

30:46.328 --> 30:50.774
Thank you, Clark.
You've been very helpful.

30:52.871 --> 30:54.191
[Latin]

30:57.629 --> 30:59.010
Clark?

31:09.584 --> 31:12.391
You alright? What happened?

31:15.072 --> 31:16.625
Did Lana do this to you?

31:16.689 --> 31:19.231
Take it easy... Where is she,
I need to find her.

31:19.238 --> 31:22.335
She's with Lois. And Chloe, but they're
different they're not themselves

31:22.414 --> 31:23.869
it's like their bodies have
been taken over.

31:23.947 --> 31:26.467
They have. In fact this is going to sound
kind of 'out there'...

31:26.469 --> 31:28.408
let's get you up...

31:28.462 --> 31:32.369
Lana has been researching a 17th century
witch. She tracked down her spell-book,

31:32.449 --> 31:34.121
and when she touched her hand to the page...

31:34.196 --> 31:37.163
Wait a second, Lana's been possessed
by the spirit of an evil witch?

31:37.258 --> 31:40.406
Yes. Isabelle got into Lana by using the
book. So we've got to find her and

31:40.411 --> 31:43.417
destroy the book. Any idea where
they went?

31:44.218 --> 31:46.233
I'm not sure.

31:46.293 --> 31:49.126
Why don't you check the school?
I'll go to the Talon.

31:49.225 --> 31:50.802
Alright.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.932
Clark. Call my Cell if you find them,
don't...

31:54.978 --> 31:57.331
Don't try anything alone.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.098
Just be careful, O.K.?

32:06.422 --> 32:08.739
Begins to make sense...

32:08.815 --> 32:13.765
Why I was resurrected here, in this
time, 1000 leagues from my home.

32:14.198 --> 32:16.464
It was destiny.

32:20.353 --> 32:22.611
Can you feel it?

32:22.728 --> 32:24.684
Calling to us.

32:24.891 --> 32:29.124
The 1st stone of power lies behind
this wall.

32:30.157 --> 32:34.884
And with it, our magic shall
increase ten-fold.

32:35.118 --> 32:38.469
And when we possess all the stones,

32:38.476 --> 32:44.289
we shall walk on Earth as Gods among men.
Reach out, and seize what was meant to be!

32:54.347 --> 32:56.696
[Latin]

33:02.068 --> 33:05.272
[Latin]

33:18.060 --> 33:22.693
All of our suffering, all of our pain and
persecution...

33:22.750 --> 33:24.768
It ends tonight.

33:24.957 --> 33:29.632
- And our future begins.
- Take it Isabelle, lead us to glory!

33:29.785 --> 33:33.754
The 1st stone.

33:33.914 --> 33:37.014
How I've dreamed of this moment.

33:37.296 --> 33:42.241
And at last, it has arrived...

33:46.261 --> 33:48.144
Not quite.

33:52.261 --> 33:55.192
You shouldn't have come, Clark.

33:56.024 --> 33:57.929
Silly boy.

33:58.715 --> 34:02.391
We owe you a debt for revealing this
chamber to us.

34:03.051 --> 34:05.069
We were going to let you live.

34:05.092 --> 34:07.597
I'm sorry Lana, but I can't
let you do this.

34:10.995 --> 34:15.846
Bear witness, Clark Kent...
to the dawn of a new age!

34:33.898 --> 34:37.135
- His powers are restored.
- How?

34:37.232 --> 34:39.614
I'm not from around here.

34:39.684 --> 34:43.474
It doesn't matter. We took them from
you once before.

34:43.536 --> 34:47.027
Do you really believe that this time
will be any different?

34:47.283 --> 34:49.833
I'm counting on it.

34:56.626 --> 34:59.716
No!

35:23.316 --> 35:25.581
Why are we lying in the dirt?

35:25.669 --> 35:28.072
And what the hell are we wearing?

35:31.980 --> 35:33.832
Are you O.K.?

35:36.745 --> 35:39.034
Clark, what happened?

35:41.390 --> 35:45.903
Let's just say that,
you haven't been yourself lately.

35:57.241 --> 36:00.057
- Look who's finally awake.
- Mom!

36:00.177 --> 36:02.817
- When did you guys get home?
- This morning. Your dad is out there

36:02.883 --> 36:05.630
- doing your chores.
- Sorry.

36:05.645 --> 36:08.076
I guess I overslept.

36:09.893 --> 36:11.381
Hey dad.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.992
Hey Clark.

36:14.629 --> 36:19.593
Son, is there maybe a little something
you'd like to tell your mother and me?

36:21.408 --> 36:23.479
Where did that come from?

36:23.550 --> 36:26.075
From out in the barn.
In the hay.

36:26.132 --> 36:28.670
- Clark!
- It was magic.

36:28.727 --> 36:32.130
- I'm sure it was.
- No, I mean... it really was!

36:32.219 --> 36:36.023
Look I should not have thrown this party
without talking to you guys, I know that.

36:36.117 --> 36:39.179
But, it's the way things spun out of control.

36:39.194 --> 36:41.981
It was Lana, well it wasn't Lana
exactly...

36:42.078 --> 36:45.958
She was possessed by a witch, who then
cast a spell on us, and...

36:46.265 --> 36:47.995
That's how that happened.

36:48.081 --> 36:52.626
Son, I realize that after all, this is
Smallville, but witches and spells...

36:52.677 --> 36:55.739
and... Magic?

36:55.760 --> 36:58.634
Dad, magic exists...
I saw it.

36:59.621 --> 37:02.375
And worse, it can hurt me.

37:17.690 --> 37:20.533
You leave quite a path
of destruction.

37:20.603 --> 37:24.115
Lex! I was going to come see you.

37:24.145 --> 37:25.878
Pre-emptive strike.

37:25.907 --> 37:29.757
Just in case there was any
'Evil Dead' action still brewing.

37:30.339 --> 37:33.696
Apparently, I have been exorcised.

37:34.455 --> 37:37.981
I didn't do anything to you, did I?

37:38.598 --> 37:40.609
Nothing permanent, but...

37:40.645 --> 37:43.988
you did display some
intriguing abilities.

37:44.585 --> 37:47.384
I don't remember anything.

37:47.667 --> 37:50.084
I don't think I really want to.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.327
I'm just glad you're alright.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.279
Thanks to Clark.

37:54.660 --> 37:57.166
I don't remember what he did, but...

37:57.219 --> 37:59.817
Isabelle's back to being history.

37:59.893 --> 38:02.686
I guess we all owe Clark our gratitude.

38:03.066 --> 38:05.022
Yeah.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.283
You know, I really don't understand him.

38:09.477 --> 38:13.621
He can be so selfless, risking his
life for his friends and...

38:14.197 --> 38:18.450
then he turns around, and gets
Jason fired.

38:18.638 --> 38:21.969
Because what, he jealous?

38:26.910 --> 38:28.484
Lana.

38:30.992 --> 38:33.771
Clark didn't get Jason fired.

38:35.499 --> 38:36.900
I did.

38:38.284 --> 38:39.799
You what?

38:40.795 --> 38:45.167
Look, no matter how mature you may
think you are, the fact is you're still

38:45.193 --> 38:47.138
in high school, and...

38:47.157 --> 38:50.573
I wasn't going to sit idle while someone
in a position of authority coerced you

38:50.654 --> 38:52.521
into a relationship.

38:53.053 --> 38:55.814
What are you doing Lex?

38:57.793 --> 39:00.221
I'm trying to protect you.

39:00.227 --> 39:03.121
Do you really think that's what I need?

39:03.190 --> 39:05.508
Lana, I know you're upset.

39:06.183 --> 39:09.428
But I only had your best
interests at heart.

39:09.716 --> 39:13.147
My interests are none of your
concern, Lex.

39:14.167 --> 39:17.880
I'm old enough to decide who I want
in my life.

39:17.888 --> 39:20.218
And who I don't.

39:39.490 --> 39:41.751
At least those aren't mine.

39:41.956 --> 39:44.118
Hey... Lana.

39:45.971 --> 39:48.265
I wanted to thank you.

39:48.835 --> 39:52.659
Once again, you managed to
come to my rescue.

39:53.539 --> 39:55.493
Well it's good to have the old Lana back.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.711
Isabelle was...

39:58.847 --> 40:00.979
Aggressively sexy.

40:01.017 --> 40:04.810
Oh great.
Possessed by an evil slut.

40:11.580 --> 40:15.193
Look, I found out the Lex was the one
that got Jason fired.

40:15.276 --> 40:19.450
I should have known that you would
never do anything like that.

40:20.139 --> 40:23.975
Look, I wasn't thrilled when I heard
about you and Jason.

40:24.441 --> 40:29.122
But I realize that the way I acted when
we were together didn't make you happy.

40:29.233 --> 40:33.151
I always resented you for keeping secrets
from me.

40:34.156 --> 40:37.770
And I don't want to do the same
thing to you.

40:39.091 --> 40:41.965
Clark, there's a reason that I came
back to Smallville.

40:42.012 --> 40:46.630
When I was in Paris, I touched Isabelle's
tomb, and there was this flash of light,

40:46.664 --> 40:50.606
and the next thing I remember is
waking up in my apartment.

40:50.627 --> 40:52.732
And I had this.

41:00.827 --> 41:03.571
I've seen this before.

41:04.553 --> 41:06.579
On the cave wall.

41:07.559 --> 41:12.327
I should have told you this months
ago, but I was too scared.

41:12.944 --> 41:15.671
Clark, you know those caves better than
anyone else...

41:15.702 --> 41:18.507
Do you know what this symbol means?

41:21.270 --> 41:25.541
No. I'm sorry.
