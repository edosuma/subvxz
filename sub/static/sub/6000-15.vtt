00:00.031 --> 00:01.524
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:01.549 --> 00:03.928
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We're living here.

00:03.953 --> 00:05.563
I do know Lori, and trust me,

00:05.588 --> 00:07.766
she is not a good person
for you to be living with.

00:07.791 --> 00:09.547
(Ben) Look, I'm just trying
to stay out of the system,

00:09.572 --> 00:11.169
and all of this between you guys,

00:11.194 --> 00:12.370
it's your drama, it's not mine.

00:12.395 --> 00:14.520
If you need anything, ever, I'm around.

00:14.545 --> 00:16.050
(Ben) Don't worry, I won't.

00:16.076 --> 00:17.346
(David) It's for Ben!

00:17.371 --> 00:19.732
He's my son, I want to help support him.

00:19.757 --> 00:21.816
We want to help support him.

00:21.841 --> 00:23.022
Sorry I didn't tell you.

00:23.047 --> 00:24.506
You should write your book, Dad.

00:24.531 --> 00:26.300
It would definitely help pay for expenses.

00:26.575 --> 00:29.185
Taylor, I've fantasized about this.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.137
Do you think that he might
have feelings for you?

00:31.176 --> 00:31.940
No.

00:31.965 --> 00:32.998
It's a crazy idea, me thinking

00:33.023 --> 00:34.023
that you want to go.

00:34.048 --> 00:35.197
No, Crash.

00:35.222 --> 00:36.501
You're on your own path.

00:36.526 --> 00:38.961
I still have to figure out what mine is.

00:38.986 --> 00:40.041
It's good to have you back.

00:40.066 --> 00:41.442
Good to be back.

00:42.858 --> 00:44.581
We need to talk.

00:47.091 --> 00:48.291
♪

00:48.316 --> 00:50.545
- Did you follow me here?
- I'm sorry, Carter.

00:50.570 --> 00:52.494
I will get a restraining
order, Lori, I'm serious.

00:52.519 --> 00:53.454
You don't have to.

00:53.479 --> 00:55.375
I know I promised to
stay away and I'm trying,

00:55.400 --> 00:56.897
but I really need to talk to you.

00:57.399 --> 00:58.992
It's about Ben.

01:00.956 --> 01:02.056
What about him?

01:02.081 --> 01:04.547
I think he may be in serious trouble.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.922
And what makes you think that?

01:06.947 --> 01:08.017
He won't talk to me.

01:08.043 --> 01:10.069
He stays in his room, comes
and goes at all hours.

01:10.094 --> 01:11.914
Yeah, he's a teenager, that's what we do.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.156
I found things...

01:13.232 --> 01:14.800
when I was cleaning his room.

01:14.825 --> 01:15.987
You went through his stuff.

01:16.012 --> 01:17.550
I know it's not right.

01:17.575 --> 01:19.376
No, it's a great way to
get him to trust you.

01:19.401 --> 01:20.701
I was worried.

01:20.726 --> 01:23.128
I found nearly 100 IDs.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.937
Some with his name, some
with other people's.

01:24.962 --> 01:26.135
Yeah, he makes fake IDs.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.130
Yeah, and there were flash
drives, too, a ton of them.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.273
And cash.

01:30.312 --> 01:34.764
Carter, he has over $7,000 in a backpack.

01:34.789 --> 01:36.240
Look, if you're so worried about it,

01:36.265 --> 01:37.409
why don't you just ask him?

01:37.434 --> 01:39.744
- He's not gonna tell me.
- Can you blame him?

01:40.791 --> 01:42.373
Maybe you could talk to him.

01:42.556 --> 01:43.556
And tell him what?

01:43.581 --> 01:44.547
Lori went through your stuff

01:44.572 --> 01:45.839
and sent me here to bust you?

01:45.864 --> 01:47.668
Something is wrong, Carter.

01:48.879 --> 01:50.146

(cell phone beeping)

02:45.860 --> 02:47.415
What's up?

02:47.823 --> 02:49.985
Lori came to see me.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.767
She thinks Ben's acting strange.

02:52.791 --> 02:53.766
Oh.

02:53.792 --> 02:54.918
She's one to talk.

02:54.943 --> 02:56.388
Right.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.275
Have you hung out with him much?

02:59.301 --> 03:00.486
Like at school or anything?

03:00.511 --> 03:01.545
A little.

03:01.570 --> 03:02.971
He pretty much keeps to himself.

03:02.996 --> 03:04.727
Yeah, I think that's
what she's worried about.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.186
Maybe he's smart.

03:06.211 --> 03:08.608
- Not sharing with her.
- No, it's more than that.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.539
Have you ever noticed
he never really answers

03:10.564 --> 03:11.897
a direct question?

03:11.922 --> 03:13.489
Like he's just telling
people what he thinks

03:13.514 --> 03:14.547
they want to hear?

03:14.572 --> 03:16.473
That's foster kid syndrome.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.056
Anyway, he was great the other night.

03:19.081 --> 03:21.690
He helped me get Gabe to
bed when he was wasted.

03:21.714 --> 03:23.224
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.745
He was cool.

03:28.322 --> 03:30.882
He thinks...  Gabe has a thing for me.

03:31.687 --> 03:33.054
Oh.

03:33.178 --> 03:35.469

10:28.449 --> 10:30.289
Carter's not around anymore

10:30.314 --> 10:31.460
and I can't believe our parents

10:31.485 --> 10:32.942
just let her drop out.

10:32.967 --> 10:34.784
Our girl is a force of nature.

10:34.809 --> 10:37.170
- Fighting her is just a losing battle.
- True.

10:37.195 --> 10:38.758
And it's not like she's vanished

10:38.783 --> 10:41.470
off the face of the earth,
she's just not in school.

10:41.495 --> 10:42.551
Well, it just means we'll have to make

10:42.576 --> 10:43.976
more time to party in the real world.

10:44.001 --> 10:45.034
Sounds like a plan.

10:45.059 --> 10:47.160
Let's just leave Gabe out of it.

10:47.185 --> 10:48.970
Yeah, he's been hitting it a bit too hard.

10:48.995 --> 10:50.829
I don't know what to do anymore.

10:50.854 --> 10:52.721
Just keep hanging out with him.

10:52.746 --> 10:54.184
I think the last thing he wants

10:54.209 --> 10:55.706
is me hovering over him right now.

10:55.731 --> 10:56.786
Yeah.

10:56.811 --> 10:59.317
He's not a fan of the
protective female vibe.

10:59.529 --> 11:01.290
I... do know one thing

11:01.315 --> 11:02.763
that might get through to him, though.

11:02.788 --> 11:03.486
What?

11:03.511 --> 11:06.662
The positive stylings
of a mellow Zen master.

11:06.687 --> 11:07.976
Hmm.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.721
If only we knew one.

11:13.121 --> 11:14.573
Hey.

11:14.598 --> 11:16.142
What are you doing down here?

11:16.167 --> 11:19.244
Well, cleaning up ten years of our stuff.

11:19.269 --> 11:21.525
I'm thinking media room.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.118
- You with me?
- I like it.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.781
Oh, hey, how did the phone call go?

11:25.806 --> 11:27.307
It went surprisingly well, actually.

11:27.332 --> 11:29.413
You were right, they liked the new pages.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.753
Great.

11:30.778 --> 11:32.354
They want to book the tour.

11:32.379 --> 11:34.571
Wow, that's huge.

11:34.596 --> 11:35.858
Right away?

11:35.883 --> 11:37.917
They're talking about
two months cross-country,

11:37.942 --> 11:40.479
potentially the UK for another month.

11:41.305 --> 11:43.136
What about your teaching job?

11:43.161 --> 11:45.525
University offered me an early sabbatical.

11:45.550 --> 11:47.641
Starting when? They're
finalizing the dates,

11:47.666 --> 11:49.756
but it could be as early
as the end of the month.

11:50.097 --> 11:52.371
And what...  What did you tell them?

11:52.396 --> 11:55.098
I said I was ready to go whenever they say.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.876
That's...  That's great.

12:00.317 --> 12:02.076
Is it?

12:02.101 --> 12:03.580
I don't know.

12:03.605 --> 12:06.140
David, do you think that this is really

12:06.165 --> 12:07.559
the best time for you to leave?

12:07.584 --> 12:09.318
I mean, we're all still a little unsettled

12:09.343 --> 12:11.778
about everything that happened.

12:11.803 --> 12:13.684
The kids need you.

12:15.342 --> 12:17.087
I need you.

12:19.927 --> 12:23.076
I know, it's not gonna be easy on you guys,

12:23.101 --> 12:26.764
but the publisher is really
getting behind this book.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.190
They're paying for a book tour.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.382
That almost never happens.

12:29.407 --> 12:30.799
And if the book is successful,

12:30.824 --> 12:33.409
that means an easier life, for all of us.

12:33.434 --> 12:34.655
Us, who?

12:34.680 --> 12:36.534
All of us, you, me, the kids.

12:36.559 --> 12:38.042
Ben, too.

12:38.793 --> 12:40.606
And Lori.

12:40.978 --> 12:42.535
- Yes.
- I don't know.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.204
When did that woman's needs
become part of our equation?

12:45.229 --> 12:46.462
This is not about her.

12:46.487 --> 12:48.824
You know, it doesn't matter how far we get.

12:48.849 --> 12:51.294
She always just pulls us back in.

12:51.319 --> 12:53.954
It's like she's some weird puppet master.

12:53.979 --> 12:55.702
David, it's just...

12:55.903 --> 12:58.838
I'm afraid that you don't see that.

12:58.863 --> 13:01.164
I do see it, Liz.

13:01.418 --> 13:03.673
I'm just trying to do what's right.

13:05.856 --> 13:09.053
(Taylor) You know when someone's
kind of all over the place

13:09.078 --> 13:10.716
and they don't really
know what they're doing

13:10.741 --> 13:12.812
and you want to say
something, but you can't

13:12.837 --> 13:15.352
because they're not ready to hear it?

13:15.894 --> 13:18.686
You trying to tell me something?

13:18.711 --> 13:20.471
No, not you, Gabe.

13:20.496 --> 13:22.151
He's a mess.

13:23.184 --> 13:25.631
Makes sense, he's going
through a really rough time.

13:25.656 --> 13:27.263
What if you went out with him?

13:27.288 --> 13:28.622
Why?

13:28.647 --> 13:29.720
What's your angle?

13:29.745 --> 13:31.253
Well, he won't talk to me, Max,

13:31.278 --> 13:32.611
and he needs to talk to someone.

13:32.636 --> 13:34.489
Maybe a guy.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.974
He has a lot of friends, doesn't he?

13:35.999 --> 13:37.802
Yeah, drunk cheerleaders.

13:37.827 --> 13:43.020
Besides... there's no one
as smart or wise as you.

13:43.658 --> 13:45.553
Come on, what could be so bad about that?

13:45.578 --> 13:48.657
Just go out with him, man to man.

13:50.237 --> 13:52.465
Like a man date?

13:53.106 --> 13:55.278
I'm just... we haven't
really hung out before,

13:55.303 --> 13:56.570
the two of us, but...

13:56.595 --> 13:58.266
Yeah, I know, but he just

13:58.291 --> 13:59.806
needs someone to show him a good time

13:59.831 --> 14:03.567
that isn't about throwing his money around,

14:03.592 --> 14:05.812
getting high and having meaningless sex.

14:05.837 --> 14:08.506
You know, like...  like a ballgame.

14:08.531 --> 14:10.434
More original than a ballgame.

14:10.459 --> 14:11.893
Oh, okay.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.450
Like what?

14:13.475 --> 14:15.576
I don't know, like dinner?

14:15.601 --> 14:17.669
And a pool game.

14:17.694 --> 14:18.828
Wow.

14:18.853 --> 14:20.649
That is so original.

14:20.674 --> 14:23.042
How'd you think of that?

14:25.235 --> 14:27.305
This means I'm gonna miss
your risotto tonight.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.904
That's okay.

14:28.930 --> 14:31.282
I'll save you some.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.009
Maybe.

14:35.034 --> 14:36.890
Possibly.

14:39.654 --> 14:41.438
(man) Right here, I'm telling you.

14:41.473 --> 14:43.635
Yeah, right there, man.

14:44.573 --> 14:46.406
- (Ben) How much does she owe you?
- (girl) Let me go!

14:46.431 --> 14:47.861
- (man) Nearly three grand!
- Okay, okay.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.393
Freaking take your hands off her!

14:49.417 --> 14:51.340
(all shouting)

14:51.365 --> 14:53.115
All right, I'll give you
the money, now let her go!

14:53.140 --> 14:54.845
Here!

14:56.324 --> 14:58.108
I gave you 1,500 last time!

14:58.133 --> 14:59.829
That's exactly what you asked for!

14:59.854 --> 15:02.093
- No!
- Go back to the suburbs where you came from!

15:02.118 --> 15:04.370
(shouting continues)

15:04.395 --> 15:06.342
How many times have I told you...

15:06.368 --> 15:08.694
(shouting)

15:09.113 --> 15:11.911
Olivia, come on, please, stop!

15:12.942 --> 15:14.510
Olivia.

15:14.535 --> 15:17.141
Olivia, I'm sorry, please!

Hey, uh...

15:32.888 --> 15:35.322
I've been thinking about Ben.

15:35.347 --> 15:37.693
No, no, no, listen, listen.

15:37.887 --> 15:40.802
Maybe he'd be better off living with us.

15:41.743 --> 15:43.111
What?

15:43.136 --> 15:45.404
Well, he would have more stability.

15:45.871 --> 15:48.091
You're probably right.

15:50.077 --> 15:53.234
But do you really want a
custody battle with Lori?

15:53.842 --> 15:56.177
No, no, of course not.

15:56.202 --> 15:57.992
I appreciate the thought.

15:58.017 --> 16:00.752
I would want him here, very much.

16:00.777 --> 16:03.790
But I don't know if this
is the time to bring it up.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.732
I get it.

16:05.757 --> 16:11.032
I, um, I was just thinking
about Ben and... you.

16:11.822 --> 16:13.840
Thank you.

16:14.783 --> 16:16.607
Thank you.

16:17.687 --> 16:21.279
I think I would want to know how

I push Lori into a corner.

Anyway... I'm kind of worried about him.

Serial killer?

- No.
- Okay.

18:01.452 --> 18:04.424
What exactly did you see?

18:04.575 --> 18:08.117
He gave this guy an envelope full of cash,

18:08.142 --> 18:10.593
and then he was arguing with this girl.

18:11.039 --> 18:12.595
You think he's dealing?

18:12.620 --> 18:14.187
I mean, I hope not.

18:14.212 --> 18:15.860
I can't think what else he would be doing

Wow.

You're right on time.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.123
Come in.

20:25.213 --> 20:26.244
Yeah, come in.

20:26.269 --> 20:27.833
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

20:27.858 --> 20:31.010
I'll, um, I'll put 'em in some water.

20:31.035 --> 20:32.803
- Join us.
- Thanks.

20:32.828 --> 20:35.839
It's very cool of you to come.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.659
Hey.

20:39.714 --> 20:41.763
Good to see you again.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.794
♪

20:43.819 --> 20:45.284
(Ben) I ended up kind of stowing away

20:45.309 --> 20:46.517
and becoming their roadie.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.943
- No way, you were on the road with Jim Tyson?
- Yeah.

20:48.968 --> 20:50.536
At the age of 14?

20:50.561 --> 20:51.346
Jim Tyson.

20:51.371 --> 20:52.838
Should I know who this is?

20:52.863 --> 20:54.237
Jim Tyson Band, Mom.

20:54.262 --> 20:55.281
Look it up.

20:55.306 --> 20:57.040
So what exactly did you do for them?

20:57.065 --> 20:58.091
Everything.

20:58.116 --> 21:00.083
Mostly fetched and carried.

21:00.108 --> 21:01.824
Man, how long were you with him?

21:01.849 --> 21:05.175
About a week until they
realized how old I was.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.301
So it was fun while it lasted.

21:07.326 --> 21:09.961
Now, a stowaway, that
would be David's dream.

21:09.986 --> 21:12.266
What, to be a 14-year-old stowaway?

21:12.291 --> 21:14.582
More like a 40-year-old stowaway.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.469
It's true.

21:15.494 --> 21:17.603
Except it'd be Neil Young, not Jim Tyson.

21:17.628 --> 21:19.692
He's cool, actually I just
read something about the whole

21:19.717 --> 21:21.652
lyrical feud between him and Skynyrd.

21:21.677 --> 21:23.324
It's like totally fiction, apparently.

21:23.349 --> 21:23.989
Right.

21:24.015 --> 21:26.193
Van Zant was answering "Southern Man,"

21:26.218 --> 21:28.072
but they actually had a lot
of respect for each other.

21:28.097 --> 21:29.894
Yeah, that's what it said.

21:31.619 --> 21:33.494
It's interesting, I would
have pegged you as more of

21:33.519 --> 21:35.053
a classical music kinda guy.

21:35.078 --> 21:36.238
Oh, snap.

21:36.263 --> 21:37.893
No, I'm into classical music myself.

21:37.919 --> 21:39.089
Yeah?

21:39.113 --> 21:41.013
Yeah, I can dig a little
Mozart here and there.

21:41.039 --> 21:43.601
Where'd you go when you
got kicked off the road?

21:43.626 --> 21:45.861
- Delaware.
- Delaware?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.449
I thought you said you lived in New Jersey.

21:49.902 --> 21:51.526
Yeah, Delaware, New Jersey.

21:51.551 --> 21:53.229
It's all kind of the same.

21:53.254 --> 21:54.806
Oh.

21:55.697 --> 21:57.822
Did Carter tell you we
saw each other today?

21:57.847 --> 21:58.947
No, where?

21:58.972 --> 22:00.940
Um, at the mall.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.935
Yeah, the mall.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.174
I was job hunting.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.725
How's that going?

22:05.750 --> 22:07.440
The whole job hunt?

22:07.464 --> 22:09.079
Uh, good.

22:09.105 --> 22:10.637
Thanks.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.144
Any luck today, hon?

22:12.169 --> 22:13.686
Uh, no, not really.

22:13.711 --> 22:14.878
Any interviews?

22:14.903 --> 22:16.838
- Just one.
- (David) Oh, how'd it go?

22:16.863 --> 22:18.717
I don't know, just okay.

22:19.186 --> 22:22.106
I guess I'm not very good at showing people

22:22.131 --> 22:24.309
who don't know me that they can trust me.

22:24.334 --> 22:25.830
I'm sure once they meet you,

22:25.855 --> 22:27.923
they realize that they can trust you.

22:28.119 --> 22:30.120
Thanks, but I don't know about that.

22:30.145 --> 22:31.779
You're pretty reliable, it's true.

22:31.804 --> 22:33.541
Trust takes time.

22:33.566 --> 22:35.890
What kind of job are you applying for?

22:35.915 --> 22:37.640
A secret agent?

22:39.784 --> 22:41.420
I'm gonna clear.

22:41.573 --> 22:43.732
Ben, would you help me?

22:43.757 --> 22:45.603
I would love to.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.501
You're helping clean up?

22:48.526 --> 22:50.340
There's no way we're related.

22:50.365 --> 22:52.789
(chuckling)

22:55.996 --> 22:57.647
(whispering) What are you doing?

22:57.672 --> 22:58.939
Well, Taylor invited me to dinner

22:58.964 --> 23:00.858
and since you were clearly
following me today,

23:00.883 --> 23:02.439
I thought I'd stop by and find out why.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.666
Okay, fine, I was following you.

23:04.919 --> 23:07.067
I was trying to get a hold of you all day

23:07.092 --> 23:08.926
and I saw you reject my call at school.

23:08.951 --> 23:10.344
Okay, so you decided to follow me?

23:10.369 --> 23:11.636
That's so messed up.

23:12.755 --> 23:15.442
Ben, Lori found your business stuff, okay?

23:15.467 --> 23:17.468
- Including the cash.
- Wait, she went through my stuff?

23:17.493 --> 23:19.972
I know she shouldn't have,
but she was worried about you

23:19.997 --> 23:21.164
and after today, so am I.

23:21.189 --> 23:22.490
What the hell were you doing in that place?

23:22.515 --> 23:23.949
I was helping out a friend.

23:23.974 --> 23:25.587
- A friend?
- Yeah.

23:26.257 --> 23:28.325
She looked like a little
more than a friend.

23:28.350 --> 23:29.614
Okay, so what?

23:29.638 --> 23:31.072
So what exactly was going on?

23:31.097 --> 23:32.500
Why did you have to pay off that guy?

23:32.525 --> 23:33.795
That's none of your business.

23:33.820 --> 23:35.720
Look, I am not gonna
judge you or tell anyone,

23:35.745 --> 23:37.020
I just want to help.

23:37.045 --> 23:38.579
Yeah, I know you think it's
your mission to save me,

23:38.604 --> 23:39.637
but I don't need your help.

23:39.662 --> 23:42.515
Ben, I have been in your position, okay?

23:42.540 --> 23:45.008
I got thrown into this family
when I really wasn't ready to

23:45.033 --> 23:46.467
have anything to do with them either.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.269
I've been taking care of myself
my whole life, all right?

23:48.294 --> 23:49.661
Okay, but now you don't have to.

23:49.686 --> 23:51.353
You have a whole family.

23:51.559 --> 23:52.759
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

23:52.784 --> 23:54.580
Carter, could I borrow Ben for a minute?

(sighing)

23:55.738 --> 23:56.738
Sure.

23:56.763 --> 23:57.872

Very clever.

to do with my family.

Delaware Water Gap a few months ago.

Nothing too intense, but it was fun.

No, I never really had
the opportunity to do

the whole outdoors thing.

25:02.555 --> 25:04.671
- You've never been camping?
- Mm-mm.

25:04.696 --> 25:06.860
Although I think I'd like it,
you know, sleeping outside

25:06.885 --> 25:08.586
and making a fire.

Um, I haven't been sleeping that well.

you get out of bed in the morning.
