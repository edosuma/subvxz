<i>to make sure that</i>

42:33.584 --> 42:38.056
what Colton is saying
is what he really means.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.794
- I'm taken back a little bit.
- Yeah.

42:42.794 --> 42:45.730
- This whole six weeks
and whatnot has--

42:45.730 --> 42:48.366
is like, to me, is like, what
are you guys talking about?

42:48.366 --> 42:50.435
We're at this point already?

42:50.435 --> 42:53.571
And, you know,
where we're at now, um,

42:53.571 --> 42:56.507
how am I gonna feel better
with me knowing

42:56.507 --> 42:59.410
that you actually
care for Tayshia

42:59.410 --> 43:01.479
or this is something
that you may

43:01.479 --> 43:02.847
want to take to the next step?

43:02.847 --> 43:05.616
- I am--I am falling in love
with her.

43:05.616 --> 43:06.918
Um...

43:06.918 --> 43:08.586
- You really say you're
falling in love with her?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.888
- Yeah.
- I mean, that's a strong word.

43:10.888 --> 43:13.891
- It is.
- It's a very strong word.

43:13.891 --> 43:16.561
You seem like
a smart man, right?

43:16.561 --> 43:18.796
And so I'm sure you can
pick the right words.

43:18.796 --> 43:21.032
And sometimes if somebody's
just falling back on

43:21.032 --> 43:24.735
their default word of saying
"falling in love" and whatnot,

43:24.735 --> 43:25.803
that's the wrong thing
to be doing,

43:25.803 --> 43:28.473
'cause now you're just
creating a web, if you will.

43:28.473 --> 43:30.708
So is it sincere?

43:30.708 --> 43:33.945
And do you think that Tayshia
knows exactly how you feel?

43:33.945 --> 43:36.647
- She does. She knows that
I'm falling in love with her.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.583
- Are you having those
same type of conversations

43:38.583 --> 43:40.651
with the other girls?

43:40.651 --> 43:42.553
I mean, it's an
uncomfortable question, right?

43:42.553 --> 43:43.754
- Yeah.

43:43.754 --> 43:46.491
Yeah, there's three other
relationships going on.

43:46.491 --> 43:46.991
- Right.

43:46.991 --> 43:50.828
- And my feelings for them
are strong.

43:50.828 --> 43:53.631
- How could you fall in love,
if you are in love,

43:53.631 --> 43:55.800
with more than one person?

43:55.800 --> 43:56.934
- I don't know.
I've never--

43:56.934 --> 43:59.704
I've never thought of it
to be possible.

43:59.704 --> 44:03.908
I've never had an opportunity
to fall in love

44:03.908 --> 44:08.246
and be in love with
more than one person.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.547
- Right.

44:09.547 --> 44:10.948
So if Tayshia was to ask you,

44:10.948 --> 44:13.684
"Are you in love
with somebody else?"

44:13.684 --> 44:16.387
would you be able to give her
that honest answer?

44:16.387 --> 44:17.722
- Yeah.

44:17.722 --> 44:18.956
- Okay.

44:18.956 --> 44:21.025
One thing I would ask,
from man to man,

44:21.025 --> 44:25.062
is just have that respect
for Tayshia and anyone else.

44:25.062 --> 44:27.932
Like, if it doesn't
work out or whatever,

44:27.932 --> 44:29.834
just don't lead anybody on.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.302
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

44:31.302 --> 44:31.802
- Yeah.

44:31.802 --> 44:34.939
I appreciate
everything that you said,

44:34.939 --> 44:37.808
and I feel like
I just want to make sure

44:37.808 --> 44:41.479
I try to be as open as where
I'm at in the relationship...

44:41.479 --> 44:42.079
- Mm-hmm.

44:42.079 --> 44:43.981
- Because I only want
to be engaged once,

44:43.981 --> 44:45.683
and I only want
to be married once.

44:45.683 --> 44:46.817
- Okay.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.686
- It's a huge commitment

44:48.686 --> 44:51.722
and it's one that
I don't take lightly.

44:51.722 --> 44:54.759
And I don't know the next time
that I'm gonna have

44:54.759 --> 44:58.629
an opportunity to ask you,
man to man, is

44:58.629 --> 45:01.832
if Tayshia and I
get to a point where

45:01.832 --> 45:05.036
I want to get down on one knee
and have her hand in marriage,

45:05.036 --> 45:10.441
I want to know if
I can have your blessing.

45:15.746 --> 45:20.051
- Colton, well.

45:20.051 --> 45:23.921
Um, man, you're
laying it on me.

45:23.921 --> 45:29.594
I appreciate you,
if you will, manning up.

45:29.594 --> 45:32.730

45:32.730 --> 45:35.399
I just met you,
you know what I mean?

45:35.399 --> 45:36.701
- Yeah.

45:36.701 --> 45:38.703
- I need to make sure
it's the right thing.

45:38.703 --> 45:39.737
- Yeah.

45:39.737 --> 45:44.075

I think you're a good guy, um,

but, obviously,
I want to protect her,

The one thing that
I really like about her

went with it.

I'm falling in love with her.

go chat in the other room?

1:00:12.409 --> 1:00:12.943

1:00:18.515 --> 1:00:20.484

1:00:21.651 --> 1:00:23.587
- Yeah.
Do you like him?

1:00:23.587 --> 1:00:25.989
- He's so amazing.
- Yeah.

1:00:25.989 --> 1:00:28.992

that, like, just really gets me

1:00:28.992 --> 1:00:30.794

But like--

1:00:30.794 --> 1:00:34.531

that you know him well enough

1:00:34.531 --> 1:00:35.966
to know that
this is somebody that--

1:00:35.966 --> 1:00:38.635
like, would you say yes
if he proposed to you?

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:41.605
- I'm still not completely
there, but...

1:00:41.605 --> 1:00:42.772
I wouldn't put myself
through this

1:00:42.772 --> 1:00:45.809
if I did not see, like,
it potentially getting there.

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:48.879
And I feel like maybe
I am falling in love with him.

1:00:48.879 --> 1:00:50.514

1:00:50.514 --> 1:00:51.548

weird to say.

1:00:51.548 --> 1:00:52.549

1:00:52.549 --> 1:00:53.917
- But I, like--
I haven't said it yet

1:00:53.917 --> 1:00:56.820
because it's something
that I feel like if I say

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:57.988
it means I'm committing
to a proposal.

1:00:57.988 --> 1:00:59.689
- But I want--
because it is, like--

1:00:59.689 --> 1:01:00.757
- It's serious!

1:01:00.757 --> 1:01:02.459
- It is such a big decision.
- It's very serious.

1:01:02.459 --> 1:01:03.760
That's something that I, like,

1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:05.795
I don't want to
feel rushed to say.

1:01:05.795 --> 1:01:07.330
- And don't.

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:08.732

1:01:08.732 --> 1:01:11.468
hundreds of other guys

like, don't shove that down.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:20.644

I want to know

she wants to be in one

It's weird how well
we match together.

minimize the fact

1:03:57.834 --> 1:03:59.102
that he's meeting
three other families.

that's a good feeling
too, when it's like--

1:04:19.089 --> 1:04:20.957

1:04:20.957 --> 1:04:23.893
is your mind saying that--
