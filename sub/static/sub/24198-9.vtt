05:12.036 --> 05:14.405

<b>"No, no, no, no, no.</b>

<b>And if your rating</b>

09:23.975 --> 09:25.410
<b>She chased the woman down,</b>

09:25.443 --> 09:27.211
<b>and she could do that</b>
<b>'cause she was white.</b>

09:27.245 --> 09:29.380
{\an1}<b>You've seen that woman.</b>
<b>She wasn't hard to chase down.</b>

09:29.414 --> 09:31.149
<b>[ Laughter ]</b>

09:31.182 --> 09:35.953
<b>You could have speed-walked</b>
<b>that woman down.</b>

09:35.987 --> 09:39.757
<b>So, white people, you're all</b>
<b>like a bunch of Clark Kents</b>

09:39.791 --> 09:41.826
<b>walking around pretending</b>
<b>not to be Superman.</b>

09:41.859 --> 09:43.828
{\an3}<b>Your white skin</b>
<b>gives you the ability</b>

09:43.861 --> 09:45.663

<b>in these situations.</b>

09:45.697 --> 09:48.266
<b>If you publicly shame somebody,</b>

09:48.299 --> 09:50.068
<b>Can a stereotype ever</b>
<b>be a good thing?</b>

09:50.101 --> 09:51.936
{\an3}<b>It's in the eye</b>
<b>of the beholder.</b>

09:51.969 --> 09:54.772
{\an1}<b>Right, 'cause there's this</b>
<b>stereotype that Australians</b>

09:54.806 --> 09:57.108

09:57.141 --> 10:01.245

<b>-It's a real thing.</b>
<b>-That's a common thing?</b>

<b>Australians are good</b>

{\an1}<b>You know? I, um --</b>

10:16.394 --> 10:19.864

<b>[ Laughter ]</b>

10:22.133 --> 10:24.502
<b>[ Applause ]</b>

10:28.039 --> 10:31.142
<b>Now, you brought</b>
<b>something to show us</b>

10:31.175 --> 10:33.177
<b>that I actually found</b>
<b>very interest--</b>

10:33.211 --> 10:34.712
{\an1}<b>Well, anyone would.</b>

10:34.746 --> 10:38.082
<b>But the Red Cross</b>
<b>brought out</b>

10:38.116 --> 10:40.284
<b>"Be Cool,</b>
<b>Follow the Rules."</b>

10:40.318 --> 10:43.688
{\an1}<b>And these are things that</b>
<b>apply for swimming-pool rules.</b>

10:43.721 --> 10:45.356
{\an3}<b>Yes, so, it's</b>
<b>a pool safety poster</b>

10:45.390 --> 10:47.392
<b>that tells kids how</b>
<b>to be cool at the pool.</b>

10:47.425 --> 10:49.093

<b>This green arrow is a</b>
<b>white person over here.</b>

10:52.897 --> 10:55.266
<b>And then most of the red arrows</b>
<b>that are saying "not cool"</b>

10:55.299 --> 10:56.968
<b>are pointing at black</b>
<b>and brown bodies.</b>

10:57.001 --> 10:59.037
<b>So it's telling kids that</b>
<b>most of the rule-breakers</b>

10:59.070 --> 11:00.738
{\an3}<b>are black and brown</b>
<b>people.</b>

11:00.772 --> 11:02.974
<b>And my favorite is this</b>
<b>kid right here in the</b>
<b>middle of the pool.</b>

11:03.007 --> 11:04.609
<b>He's just swimming</b>
<b>with his mouth open.</b>

11:04.642 --> 11:06.210
<b>What's wrong with that?</b>

<b>"He's too good at swimming,</b>

<b>Get him out of the pool!"</b>

11:11.816 --> 11:13.418

{\an1}<b>I don't want say</b>

<b>If you've flown,</b>

<b>with an emotional</b>

<b>You've seen the tags</b>

<b>but it's not uncommon for people</b>
<b>to register support pigs,</b>

<b>goats, or monkeys,</b>
<b>or even more exotic things.</b>

12:10.386 --> 12:12.588

<b>Personally, I'd rather</b>
<b>have a support camel</b>

12:57.800 --> 12:59.234
<b>There are big differences</b>

<b>between support animals</b>
<b>and legitimate service animals.</b>

<b>that only dogs</b>
<b>can be service animals.</b>

13:08.043 --> 13:10.946
<b>Second, service dogs</b>
<b>actually do stuff,</b>

13:10.980 --> 13:14.316
<b>like keeping blind people</b>
<b>from getting run over.</b>

13:14.350 --> 13:16.819

<b>Yeah, of course</b>

<b>No one has a dog that's</b>

<b>That's our show,</b>

19:05.861 --> 19:07.997
{\an1}<b>tonight, we talked about cops</b>

19:08.030 --> 19:10.800
<b>being wrongfully called</b>
<b>on black people,</b>

19:10.833 --> 19:12.635

19:12.668 --> 19:14.670
<b>what would it take</b>
<b>for a white person</b>

19:14.703 --> 19:16.372
{\an1}<b>to get reported to the police?</b>

19:16.405 --> 19:18.774
<b>The answer? Watch this.</b>

19:18.808 --> 19:22.211
<b>This is a woman getting upset</b>

19:22.244 --> 19:23.712
<b>Now, she seems upset.</b>

19:23.746 --> 19:25.881
<b>So, what she does is</b>
<b>leans against the wall,</b>

19:25.915 --> 19:27.983
<b>takes a shit on the floor.</b>

19:28.017 --> 19:29.385

{\an1}<b>wipes her ass, throws it again.</b>

19:36.325 --> 19:39.295

19:39.328 --> 19:42.398

19:56.612 --> 19:58.981
{\an1}<b>Not because of the shitting,</b>
