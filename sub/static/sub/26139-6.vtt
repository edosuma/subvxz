WEBVTT

00:00.526 --> 00:02.528
(birds singing)

00:11.403 --> 00:13.172
GEORGE:
You have to understand,

00:13.205 --> 00:15.707
we've had so many weirdos
who just want to come in

00:15.741 --> 00:17.209
and see this place up close.

00:17.243 --> 00:20.012
So, I need to check
on a few things,

00:20.046 --> 00:21.980
and I'll be right back.

00:26.352 --> 00:28.054
There is no way
we pull this off.

00:28.087 --> 00:29.988
Okay, we look like
the worst possible versions

00:30.022 --> 00:31.157
of Heidi Klum and Seal.

00:31.190 --> 00:32.991
Do you ever stop complaining?

00:33.025 --> 00:34.493
I have a right to complain.

00:34.526 --> 00:35.561
Okay, the council
sent me here because

00:35.594 --> 00:36.895
they obviously think
I'm expendable.

00:36.928 --> 00:38.330
And I had to put khakis on,

00:38.364 --> 00:40.399
so it's been a hard day
for all of us.

00:40.432 --> 00:42.668
So maybe just shut up.

00:42.701 --> 00:46.305
GEORGE:
All right, Mr. and Mrs. James.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.506
(chuckles)

00:47.539 --> 00:49.508
The wire transfer went through.

00:49.541 --> 00:52.078
All you need to do now is sign.

00:52.111 --> 00:54.513
I just can't wait to start
making babies in our new home.

00:54.546 --> 00:55.514
(chuckles)

00:55.547 --> 00:57.083
Well, before you start that,

00:57.116 --> 00:59.218
there, there are issues

00:59.251 --> 01:01.820
I legally have
to make you aware of.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.823
This house has been unoccupied
for quite some time.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.725
Over the past decade alone,
there have been

01:06.758 --> 01:08.560
an unprecedented amount
of break-ins,

01:08.594 --> 01:10.896
missing persons reports.

01:10.929 --> 01:12.731
And, of course,
the most disturbing...

01:12.764 --> 01:14.700
You mean the people
that died there?

01:14.733 --> 01:16.202
Yeah, we know.

01:16.235 --> 01:18.570
About all 36 of them?

01:18.604 --> 01:20.372
Uh, what can we say?
(laughs)

01:20.406 --> 01:22.007
The wife's a sucker
for a farmhouse kitchen.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.611
Okay, but to be clear,
we're not legally liable

01:25.644 --> 01:27.846
for any accidents,
fatal or otherwise.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.382
Other than that,
congrats on your new home.

01:30.416 --> 01:31.617
Yay.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.051
Don't worry,
we'll burn some sage.

01:33.085 --> 01:34.586
(all laugh)

01:34.620 --> 01:36.622
*

01:44.663 --> 01:48.400
What. A. Shithole.

01:53.972 --> 01:55.974
*

02:24.970 --> 02:27.473
*

03:07.012 --> 03:10.316
Oh, so you an obstinate house.

03:10.349 --> 03:13.319
Just use the key.

03:17.256 --> 03:19.691
(lock clicks)

03:19.725 --> 03:22.160
(door creaking)

03:30.202 --> 03:31.203
Weird.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.008
How long did the realtor say
this place has been empty?

03:37.042 --> 03:40.312
It looks like someone
still lives here.

03:40.346 --> 03:43.081
Something definitely
lives here.

03:43.114 --> 03:44.583
The psychic energy is
stronger than

03:44.616 --> 03:47.185
anything I've ever felt before.

03:47.219 --> 03:49.688
This is not a home,
this is a prison.

03:49.721 --> 03:52.758
I pity the souls trapped here.

03:52.791 --> 03:54.159
It must be hell.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.561
I've actually been to Hell.

03:55.594 --> 03:57.929
I promise you, this is better.

03:57.963 --> 04:00.165
Well, I'm sensing
really bad vibes.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.233
Maybe we should go clubbing.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.168
(sighs) If you'd asked me
a few years ago,

04:03.201 --> 04:05.003
I'd be hitting up
my coke dealer right now.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.839
But I got a second chance
at life.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.008
A third chance, actually.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.877
I can't fuck it up.

04:11.910 --> 04:15.080
Don't forget who gave you
that chance.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.954
Do you honestly think
Michael is evil?

04:22.988 --> 04:24.690
That's what we're here
to find out.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.925
Cordelia wouldn't send us
all this way for no reason.

04:53.452 --> 04:54.953
I've never seen
this spell before.

04:54.986 --> 04:57.389
These spirits do not want
to be seen by us.

04:57.423 --> 05:00.125
We are trespassers
in their home,

05:00.158 --> 05:02.328
and if we want to talk to them,
we're gonna have

05:02.361 --> 05:04.262
to force them out of hiding.

05:04.296 --> 05:07.132
Boy Supreme's family died here.

05:07.165 --> 05:09.768
If anyone has the goods
on Michael, it's them.

05:09.801 --> 05:12.604
It's the others
I'm worried about.

05:12.638 --> 05:17.242
This place is more crowded
than a French youth hostel.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.645
Who knows what
we're walking into?

05:22.614 --> 05:26.685
Okay... let's see if this works.

05:26.718 --> 05:30.689
My powers have been off since
we stepped into this place.

05:36.161 --> 05:40.165
Monstra te spirituum.

05:40.198 --> 05:43.969
BOTH:
Monstra te spirituum.

05:44.002 --> 05:48.940
Ne abscondas.
Ne abscondas.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.308
Ne abscondas!

05:57.383 --> 05:58.984
(floor creaking)

06:01.319 --> 06:02.588
Did it work?

06:05.657 --> 06:07.426
We're in.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.383
(children's laughter echoing)

06:31.417 --> 06:32.518
(gasps)

06:32.551 --> 06:34.853
Calm down, skinny witch.

06:34.886 --> 06:36.054
(laughing)

06:39.391 --> 06:42.127
What the fuck happened
in this house?

06:47.433 --> 06:51.903
TATE: I've told you this
a million times.

06:51.937 --> 06:54.406
You're my psychiatrist.
You're supposed to help me.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.841
BEN:
I have helped you.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.077
We've had daily sessions
going on for years now.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.345
I feel like the only reason
you're talking to me

07:00.378 --> 07:01.947
is 'cause your wife refuses
to talk to you.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.449
Let's leave her out of this.

07:03.482 --> 07:04.883
Well, then let's talk
about your daughter.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.418
'Cause that's what I really
need your help with.

07:06.452 --> 07:12.357
* Sometimes I feel
I've got to run away... *

07:12.390 --> 07:15.527
Violet, please, talk to me.

07:15.561 --> 07:19.798
* Get away from the pain
that you drive... *

07:19.831 --> 07:23.401
You're the only thing I need!

07:23.435 --> 07:24.870
It's torture.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.405
Can you just talk to her?

07:27.439 --> 07:30.141
What do you want me to say?

07:30.175 --> 07:32.077
You set fire
to your mom's boyfriend,

07:32.110 --> 07:35.080
you shot and killed over
a dozen kids in high school,

07:35.113 --> 07:36.815
you helped kill her parents,

07:36.848 --> 07:39.985
plus, you impregnated
her mother.

07:40.018 --> 07:41.653
Any one of those things
would be reason enough...

07:41.687 --> 07:45.356
I'm different now.
Yeah, I'm...

07:46.758 --> 07:48.594
You know, I'm dead
and-and-and I'm hot,

07:48.627 --> 07:52.397
and I know she has
feelings for me.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.099
You're not so hot.

07:57.869 --> 08:00.305
That's right, you can see us,

08:00.338 --> 08:02.073
and we can see you.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.643
Who are you?

08:04.676 --> 08:08.146
I'm Behold Chablis.
This is Madison Montgomery.

08:08.179 --> 08:10.148
You are Ben Harmon.

08:10.181 --> 08:11.416
You killed yourself
in this house several years ago

08:11.449 --> 08:13.519
after your wife died
in childbirth.

08:13.552 --> 08:15.120
What are you talking about?
I didn't kill myself.

08:15.153 --> 08:16.187
I was murdered.

08:16.221 --> 08:17.656
What the fuck is going on here?

08:17.689 --> 08:19.257
We decide when we want
to be seen.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.759
Not anymore.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.694
You're looking
at two powerful witches.

08:22.728 --> 08:25.163
And the spell we cast is
just a small demonstration

08:25.196 --> 08:27.032
of what we can do.

08:27.065 --> 08:29.535
So, if you don't want
any more disruptions,

08:29.568 --> 08:31.369
you're gonna have to answer
some hard questions

08:31.402 --> 08:34.072
about Michael Langdon.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.611
What are you gonna do,
make us more dead?

08:39.645 --> 08:43.448
Even people protected by magic
aren't safe in this house.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.684
I'd watch my ass if I were you.

08:46.685 --> 08:48.353
(sighs)

08:48.386 --> 08:49.755
Look, it's really important.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.459
Our coven bought you
a goddamn house

08:54.492 --> 08:57.195
so nobody will come
to bother you ever again.

08:57.228 --> 08:59.397
Sorry, you got me
at a bad time, I'm busy.

08:59.430 --> 09:01.299
You're dead.
What do you have to do?

09:01.332 --> 09:03.735
I got to look out the window
and cry while I masturbate.

09:03.769 --> 09:05.036
It's my daily thing.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.743
Okay, I know it's weird,
but I kind of feel for the guy.

09:11.777 --> 09:14.512
Should we try to help him?

09:14.546 --> 09:15.547
You mean the tear jerker?

09:15.581 --> 09:17.649
Ew, no, the other guy.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.250
Sounds like he's stuck
in a nightmare,

09:19.284 --> 09:21.252
trapped in this
Amityville reject

09:21.286 --> 09:25.991
with the one thing he loves
but can never have.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.959
It's a romantic tragedy.

09:51.817 --> 09:53.919
(screams)

09:53.952 --> 09:57.188
Aah, get the fuck off of me!

09:57.222 --> 09:59.858
-Be gone!
-You don't want to do that.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.694
You'll have a house full
of spirits coming after you,

10:02.728 --> 10:04.730
and they aren't all
as gentle as this one.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.400
Beau, sweetie, you want to play?

10:09.434 --> 10:11.737
Play!

10:17.976 --> 10:19.477
Who the hell are you?

10:19.510 --> 10:22.247
A friend of the house
and its residents.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.615
They don't take kindly
to strangers.

10:23.649 --> 10:25.751
You ain't dead?

10:25.784 --> 10:27.619
Oh, honey,
I'm one of the few live ones

10:27.653 --> 10:29.487
they let come and go.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.958
And you are Madison Montgomery.

10:32.991 --> 10:35.794
Oh, have you seen my movies?

10:35.827 --> 10:38.096
-I have fans everywhere.
-No.

10:38.129 --> 10:39.798
I've known a few Montgomerys
in my time,

10:39.831 --> 10:41.633
but it's not every day
that I see a witch.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.302
What are you?

10:44.335 --> 10:46.437
Billie Dean Howard,

10:46.471 --> 10:48.306
medium to the stars.

10:48.339 --> 10:50.141
So, you're like
a shitty Ms. Cleo.

10:50.175 --> 10:51.977
Excuse me?

10:52.010 --> 10:54.780
Now, who do you think you are,
coming in here,

10:54.813 --> 10:59.785
swanning around,
spewing vulgarities?

10:59.818 --> 11:02.453
We're the new owners.
Who are you?

11:02.487 --> 11:06.157
I'm Constance Langdon.

11:06.191 --> 11:10.028
And this... is my fucking house.

11:18.904 --> 11:21.039
(chuckles)

11:21.072 --> 11:24.642
Well, you two are
the most unlikely pair.

11:24.676 --> 11:29.547
But, on the plus side,

11:29.580 --> 11:32.884
your spawn will have
beautiful skin.

11:32.918 --> 11:35.286
They're witches, Constance.
It's magic,

11:35.320 --> 11:36.955
not marriage,
that connects them.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.189
They won't be moving in.

11:38.223 --> 11:40.658
Well, now,
that is disappointing.

11:40.692 --> 11:43.228
I guess I can't expect you
to go running down to the Korean

11:43.261 --> 11:46.631
to get me my Crown Royal
and Virginia Slims?

11:46.664 --> 11:49.167
You drink Crown Royal?
You're dead.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.501
(both chuckle)

11:50.535 --> 11:52.637
It's true that this side
of the mortal coil

11:52.670 --> 11:54.973
makes it impossible
to get a good buzz going,

11:55.006 --> 11:58.243
but, well, old habits die hard.

11:58.276 --> 11:59.377
(woman clears throat)

11:59.410 --> 12:00.979
It's done.

12:01.012 --> 12:05.050
As demanded, the living room
has been tidied yet again.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.353
We'll see about that.

12:08.386 --> 12:11.189
I won't be but a moment.

12:12.223 --> 12:15.026
It'll be more than a moment.

12:22.734 --> 12:25.403
Oh.

12:25.436 --> 12:27.205
(chuckles)

12:29.875 --> 12:33.945
Do you know what this is
on the tip of my finger?

12:33.979 --> 12:36.014
It appears to be some dust
that I missed.

12:36.047 --> 12:40.752
No, it's my sense of wonder.

12:40.786 --> 12:45.590
Why, it-it's the color
of my piqued curiosity, it...

12:45.623 --> 12:46.792
Oh, will you just
get on with it?

12:46.825 --> 12:49.427
Just because we're
trapped here for eternity

12:49.460 --> 12:52.964
doesn't mean you have to jabber
on forever to make a point.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.867
Tell me, little Miss Moira,

12:55.901 --> 12:59.304
if you're going to be
an old maid for all eternity,

12:59.337 --> 13:01.739
why not be a decent one, hmm?

13:01.773 --> 13:04.075
(laughs)
My real work,

13:04.109 --> 13:08.246
my avocation, if you will,
isn't dusting--

13:08.279 --> 13:11.082
it's satisfying your husband
in the basement.

13:11.116 --> 13:13.919
Be careful.
My mother told me

13:13.952 --> 13:15.553
pettiness causes wrinkles.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.721
So does cruelty.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.390
Disappointment makes
a woman bitter.

13:19.424 --> 13:23.728
And when I think of all
of the unfulfilled dreams

13:23.761 --> 13:27.132
that you left behind when
you took the coward's way out,

13:27.165 --> 13:31.870
well, I guess I'd be pretty
miffed at the world, too.

13:36.007 --> 13:36.975
You ladies all right in here?

13:37.008 --> 13:39.845
It is so hard to find good help.

13:39.878 --> 13:42.680
That poor woman.

13:42.713 --> 13:44.682
In a house filled with tragedy,

13:44.715 --> 13:47.118
she might be
the saddest soul of all.

13:47.152 --> 13:49.120
-Oh, shut up.
-All right.

13:49.154 --> 13:52.123
Look, we need the hot goss
on a guy who used to live here,

13:52.157 --> 13:53.324
uh, Michael Langdon.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.165
We have nothing to say
about him.

14:00.198 --> 14:01.466
You did raise him, correct?

14:01.499 --> 14:04.169
I said we're not talking.

14:04.202 --> 14:07.172
Oh, pipe down, Billie.

14:07.205 --> 14:12.677
I know more about that boy
than any woman, dead or alive.

14:14.579 --> 14:17.815
But I don't spill a drop of tea
for free, kiddos.

14:17.849 --> 14:20.385
Self-interest, hmm.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.321
That's something
I can get behind.

14:23.354 --> 14:24.722
What do you want?

14:24.755 --> 14:29.494
To remove that insufferable
cloudy-eyed ginger

14:29.527 --> 14:32.463
from these premises permanently.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.332
You want us to fire the help?

14:34.365 --> 14:36.334
Well, if you really do have

14:36.367 --> 14:39.070
witchcraft at your disposal,

14:39.104 --> 14:41.206
then why don't you just

14:41.239 --> 14:44.542
abracadabra that goddamn bitch

14:44.575 --> 14:47.212
out of my afterlife, huh?

14:47.245 --> 14:51.649
Bless me
with some peace and quiet.

14:51.682 --> 14:56.521
And then we can talk
about Michael all you want.

15:05.396 --> 15:06.965
Got something!

15:08.299 --> 15:10.401
Ah!

15:20.278 --> 15:22.280
Nope.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.215
Not hers.

15:24.249 --> 15:25.850
It's got a totally
different vibration.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.954
Moira's bones would be
much more morose.

15:28.987 --> 15:31.222
You know this
is ridiculous, right?

15:31.256 --> 15:32.623
This place has
more bodies buried

15:32.657 --> 15:34.359
than the catacombs in Rome.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.894
If Constance wants us
to get rid of the maid,

15:36.928 --> 15:40.031
I know a spell that can
easily bind her to the closet.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.532
She'll never have
to see her again.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.234
Keep digging.

15:44.302 --> 15:45.836
Ah!

15:57.748 --> 15:58.916
You have an enemy.

15:58.950 --> 16:03.321
I'm proud to say I have many.

16:03.354 --> 16:05.156
You can't live with virtue

16:05.190 --> 16:07.792
without getting on the bad side
of those without.

16:07.825 --> 16:10.461
Constance hates your guts.

16:10.495 --> 16:12.897
She won't talk to us
unless we put you away.

16:12.930 --> 16:17.602
Out of sight forever.

16:17.635 --> 16:20.105
What are you going to do to me?

16:24.976 --> 16:28.679
(gasps)
Oh, heavens be.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.715
My bones.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.952
I can't begin to thank you.

16:34.986 --> 16:37.588
These bones are my means
to escape.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.326
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

16:41.359 --> 16:44.996
(whispering):
Thank you. Thank you.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.032
Okay.

16:48.466 --> 16:52.170
Okay, you're getting slobber
on my clothes.

16:52.203 --> 16:55.173
-(sniffs, clears throat)
-Moira.

16:55.206 --> 16:57.875
You have a choice.

16:57.908 --> 17:00.411
Where do you want to be buried?

17:02.480 --> 17:07.252
There's only one place
I've ever wanted to be.

17:13.191 --> 17:14.992
How original,

17:15.026 --> 17:16.827
to be buried in a cemetery.

17:16.861 --> 17:20.365
Her wish was to be close
to her mother.

17:20.398 --> 17:23.334
I want my bones to be buried
at the studio.

17:23.368 --> 17:25.503
Paramount, Stage 7.

17:25.536 --> 17:29.740
I would gladly haunt the shit
out of that place.

17:29.774 --> 17:32.543
It's where they made me do
my first nude scene.

17:32.577 --> 17:34.845
Totally gratuitous.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.482
I begged for a body double,

17:37.515 --> 17:40.518
but the asshole producer wanted
to get his rocks off, so...

17:40.551 --> 17:42.320
You surprised me.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.223
Under the facade
of a heartless narcissist...

17:45.256 --> 17:46.557
Is a stone-cold bitch.

17:46.591 --> 17:48.859
Listen, warlock,

17:48.893 --> 17:50.528
I wouldn't think twice
about slitting your throat

17:50.561 --> 17:52.330
if I thought it would get me
out of that house

17:52.363 --> 17:53.664
a second sooner
with the answers.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.067
Duly warned.

17:59.070 --> 18:01.439
(both sigh)

18:19.257 --> 18:21.259
*

18:33.003 --> 18:35.940
Oh, Mother.

18:38.109 --> 18:41.612
Your hands.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.417
They're as beautiful
as I remembered.

18:50.188 --> 18:51.656
What's wrong?

18:53.524 --> 18:57.228
I have to confess something.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.863
I killed you.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.469
I pulled the plug
on the respirator

19:04.502 --> 19:06.471
because I couldn't bear
leaving you

19:06.504 --> 19:08.273
in that horrible nursing home.

19:10.341 --> 19:11.842
Can you ever forgive me?

19:11.876 --> 19:14.312
Darling,

19:14.345 --> 19:18.583
I wanted to smother you
with kisses.

19:18.616 --> 19:22.853
I was in agony,
and you gave me peace.

19:23.888 --> 19:26.157
-Oh.
-Oh.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.028
It's beautiful here.

19:32.863 --> 19:35.200
I feel like I can
finally breathe.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.836
*

20:18.243 --> 20:19.644
MADISON:
We did what you asked.

20:19.677 --> 20:20.978
Moira's gone,

20:21.011 --> 20:23.881
-so you can start any time now.
-Shh...

20:25.616 --> 20:30.154
I was just savoring
the stillness.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.257
Not only was that woman

20:32.290 --> 20:35.693
the worst maid
in God's creation,

20:35.726 --> 20:37.695
but she would never shut up.

20:37.728 --> 20:40.531
Death only made her
more verbose.

20:40.565 --> 20:42.433
Tell us about Michael.

20:42.467 --> 20:46.571
Well...

20:46.604 --> 20:49.006
he was born right here
in this house

20:49.039 --> 20:51.742
to a mother and a family

20:51.776 --> 20:54.712
ultimately marked for death.

20:54.745 --> 20:56.714
(screams)

20:56.747 --> 20:59.617
*

21:03.288 --> 21:04.689
When his mother died

21:04.722 --> 21:07.224
pushing him out into the world,

21:07.258 --> 21:09.860
I gladly assumed the burden

21:09.894 --> 21:12.430
of raising him.

21:12.463 --> 21:15.700
You see, I-I-I am
a mother myself,

21:15.733 --> 21:18.403
four times over.

21:18.436 --> 21:20.471
-(chuckles)
-Why you?

21:20.505 --> 21:21.739
Because

21:21.772 --> 21:23.574
he also happened
to be my grandson.

21:23.608 --> 21:26.644
His father was that handsome

21:26.677 --> 21:29.914
young man in the sweater
and the mop top

21:29.947 --> 21:33.217
that you saw when you
first came in... Tate.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.621
Now, I am the first
to admit that, um,

21:36.654 --> 21:40.625
there were mistakes made
raising Tate.

21:40.658 --> 21:44.061
And that's why, with Michael--
oh, my God--

21:44.094 --> 21:46.397
he was such a perfect

21:46.431 --> 21:49.099
little angel of light.

21:49.133 --> 21:52.803
I thought that would be
my chance for a do-over.

21:52.837 --> 21:56.641
You see, I was born
to be a mother.

21:56.674 --> 21:58.943
I always felt that,

21:58.976 --> 22:02.447
to raise a great man,

22:02.480 --> 22:07.284
that was the most admirable
and selfless act

22:07.318 --> 22:09.687
a woman could aspire to.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.256
He was my destiny.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.325
Oh, such a beautiful child,

22:14.359 --> 22:17.595
with such a cheerful
disposition.

22:17.628 --> 22:22.533
Even when he was committing
unspeakable acts.

22:22.567 --> 22:24.001
What do you mean unspeakable?

22:24.034 --> 22:28.038
Well, it was trivial at first,
of course, you know.

22:28.072 --> 22:29.540
I'd find dead flies in his crib

22:29.574 --> 22:32.443
with their wings shorn off
and...

22:32.477 --> 22:37.515
And then, as he got older...
small rodents.

22:37.548 --> 22:40.451
I had seen enough

22:40.485 --> 22:43.621
Discovery Channel specials
to know exactly

22:43.654 --> 22:46.491
what evolutionary tree
he was shimmying up.

22:46.524 --> 22:48.893
Bundy, Dahmer,

22:48.926 --> 22:52.797
they started
with small animals, too...

22:52.830 --> 22:56.534
until they graduated

22:56.567 --> 22:58.569
to grander things.

23:02.440 --> 23:07.845
He said they were presents
because he loved me.

23:07.878 --> 23:10.180
Oh, and his love did flow.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.383
And enjoyable as it was,
to have a child

23:12.417 --> 23:16.153
so committed to expressing
his love for me,

23:16.186 --> 23:19.056
I did try to encourage him
to find

23:19.089 --> 23:21.859
another avenue of expression.

23:21.892 --> 23:23.594
Still, nothing I could say

23:23.628 --> 23:26.431
would get him to cease.

23:26.464 --> 23:29.366
Each time I would dutifully

23:29.400 --> 23:34.171
bury one of these gifts along
with a little piece of my soul.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.508
Well, I tried to find

23:37.542 --> 23:40.210
a silver lining

23:40.244 --> 23:42.179
to make lemonade out of lemons,

23:42.212 --> 23:45.550
so every time I buried
one of his presents,

23:45.583 --> 23:47.418
I planted a rose bush on top.

23:47.452 --> 23:50.054
You know, from death

23:50.087 --> 23:52.557
springs life eternal.

23:54.091 --> 23:57.227
You are childless, I presume?

23:57.261 --> 24:00.765
A skinny little thing like you
would struggle to carry.

24:00.798 --> 24:03.801
I don't really have
the disposition for motherhood.

24:03.834 --> 24:06.403
If my child wasn't cool
or good-looking,

24:06.437 --> 24:07.772
there's no way I'd love it.

24:07.805 --> 24:09.273
Well, not me.

24:09.306 --> 24:10.741
I loved them all.

24:10.775 --> 24:13.377
It was Michael

24:13.410 --> 24:16.080
who made me realize

24:16.113 --> 24:18.382
that I was put on this earth

24:18.415 --> 24:21.586
to raise the monsters.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.592
I never thought I would tire

24:27.625 --> 24:29.627
of the smell of roses.

24:31.462 --> 24:34.565
Roses had always been
my favorite flower,

24:34.599 --> 24:38.168
but soon they made me

24:38.202 --> 24:40.204
just want to retch.

24:44.875 --> 24:49.614
And of course then there was
that incident with the sitter.

24:53.350 --> 24:55.419
I was able to convince
the authorities

24:55.452 --> 24:58.122
that she had taken
her own life.

24:58.155 --> 24:59.624
(Michael giggles)

24:59.657 --> 25:02.426
At least I didn't have
to bury that one.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.595
Um, up until that point,

25:04.629 --> 25:06.597
I thought I was raising

25:06.631 --> 25:10.300
a garden variety serial killer,

25:10.334 --> 25:13.804
or possibly even a gifted one--

25:13.838 --> 25:16.040
you know, with its

25:16.073 --> 25:18.008
attendant challenges.

25:18.042 --> 25:20.010
But then came the day
when he was late

25:20.044 --> 25:22.547
getting up for school,

25:22.580 --> 25:25.015
so I went in to wake him.

25:26.851 --> 25:29.754
And there was a stranger
in his bed.

25:31.522 --> 25:32.890
Well, not a stranger,

25:32.923 --> 25:34.825
I mean, it was still
my grandson.

25:34.859 --> 25:39.396
He'd aged a decade overnight.

25:39.429 --> 25:41.732
Now, that was something

25:41.766 --> 25:44.769
far outside the natural realm.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.575
It was almost as if he was

25:50.608 --> 25:53.410
in a hurry to get somewhere,

25:53.443 --> 25:56.914
age-wise, know what I mean?

25:56.947 --> 25:59.416
(choking)

26:01.586 --> 26:03.754
You don't tell me
what to do anymore.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.700
(gasping)

26:21.371 --> 26:23.173
Grandma?

26:23.207 --> 26:25.943
(crying):
Oh.

26:32.082 --> 26:33.751
I'm-I'm sorry.

26:38.088 --> 26:40.457
Can I have a glass of water?

26:40.490 --> 26:42.627
(stammers)

26:42.660 --> 26:45.630
M-M... May I?

26:45.663 --> 26:49.734
M... May I?

26:49.767 --> 26:54.605
Yes. Yes, you may.

26:54.639 --> 26:56.641
(crying)

27:06.016 --> 27:08.085
When you look at men
of significance,

27:08.118 --> 27:12.322
you know, like artists
or world leaders,

27:12.356 --> 27:15.225
inventors, they have all had

27:15.259 --> 27:17.662
their particular peccadilloes

27:17.695 --> 27:19.496
on their road to the top,
haven't they?

27:19.529 --> 27:23.868
But aging ten years
overnight...

27:25.770 --> 27:28.338
...that called
for sacred intervention.

27:30.307 --> 27:32.376
(game device chiming)

27:38.015 --> 27:42.086
I had to accept
that once again,

27:42.119 --> 27:46.156
my days as a mother
were at an end.

27:46.190 --> 27:52.029
I have been burdened
with heartbreak my whole life.

27:52.062 --> 27:55.933
Broken dreams, broken promises,
broken marriages.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.803
But this one...

28:02.873 --> 28:05.475
(laughs)

28:05.509 --> 28:11.148
...this one shattered me
beyond recovery.

28:11.181 --> 28:13.550
Michael had made me believe

28:13.583 --> 28:19.156
that my presence here
meant something.

28:22.927 --> 28:25.129
That I mattered.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.031
(sniffles)

28:27.064 --> 28:32.269
But I was just an invisible step
along the path.

28:33.537 --> 28:37.908
He was done with me.

28:37.942 --> 28:42.546
Honestly, I think that...

28:42.579 --> 28:46.984
if I had corrected his grammar
one more time,

28:47.017 --> 28:50.988
he would've just slit my throat.

28:51.021 --> 28:54.424
Like the help.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.260
I wasn't going to give him

28:56.293 --> 28:58.896
or any man the satisfaction.

28:58.929 --> 29:02.032
I have always lived my life

29:02.066 --> 29:05.335
on my own terms.

29:05.369 --> 29:10.040
So I came here.

29:10.074 --> 29:12.442
A prison, yes.

29:12.476 --> 29:16.413
But one where I knew the rules,
and more importantly...

29:16.446 --> 29:17.848
("You're Gonna Miss Me"
by Connie Francis playing)

29:17.882 --> 29:21.685
...where I knew the company.

29:21.718 --> 29:24.288
*

29:31.561 --> 29:34.932
* One kiss *

29:34.965 --> 29:39.403
* One little sigh... *

29:39.436 --> 29:43.540
Bottle of whiskey
and a fenny chaser.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.542
(laughs softly)

29:45.575 --> 29:49.213
Ooh, that's what I call
a bon voyage.

29:49.246 --> 29:53.483
* Someday, baby,
someday, darling *

29:54.618 --> 29:57.922
* You're gonna miss me *

29:57.955 --> 30:01.959
* Hmm *

30:01.992 --> 30:05.562
* Long gone *

30:05.595 --> 30:08.933
* Is your caress *

30:08.966 --> 30:11.401
* And with it *

30:11.435 --> 30:16.506
* All of my happiness *

30:16.540 --> 30:20.744
* But someday, baby *

30:20.777 --> 30:24.348
* Someday, darling *

30:24.381 --> 30:30.020
* You're gonna miss me *

30:30.054 --> 30:34.458
* Oh, oh, oh *

30:34.491 --> 30:35.926
* Yes. *

30:35.960 --> 30:39.196
I awoke to find myself

30:39.229 --> 30:41.966
surrounded
by my precious children.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.802
Well, minus my beloved Addie.

30:45.836 --> 30:47.872
God rest her soul.

30:47.905 --> 30:50.040
But the others were there.

30:50.074 --> 30:52.609
All of them.

30:52.642 --> 30:56.847
With me, forever.

30:56.881 --> 31:00.284
And that is the real reason

31:00.317 --> 31:03.053
I bound my soul to this place.

31:03.087 --> 31:08.292
Because, like I said earlier,

31:08.325 --> 31:12.129
I was born to be a mother.

31:12.162 --> 31:16.466
Why not die to be one, too?

31:16.500 --> 31:20.470
As for my grandson...

31:20.504 --> 31:23.773
I never wanted to see him again.

31:28.512 --> 31:29.880
Well, there it is.

31:29.914 --> 31:31.548
(exhales)

31:31.581 --> 31:33.517
The whole story.

31:33.550 --> 31:38.188
Was it everything
you dreamed of, witchypoos?

31:45.729 --> 31:47.631
GIRL:
Mommy.

31:49.099 --> 31:50.400
Yes, my darling?

31:50.434 --> 31:51.835
It's almost tea time.

31:51.868 --> 31:55.605
Of course it is,
my little beauty queen.

31:55.639 --> 31:58.275
How foolish of me.
(laughs softly)

32:00.244 --> 32:02.612
Well, now.

32:02.646 --> 32:05.015
You'll have to excuse me now.

32:05.049 --> 32:07.384
My family calls.

32:14.658 --> 32:16.726
Let's go.

32:29.839 --> 32:32.309
(moaning)

32:37.314 --> 32:39.749
(crying)

32:47.357 --> 32:49.994
You gonna be much longer, DILF?

32:50.027 --> 32:53.497
What the hell?
People don't knock anymore?

32:53.530 --> 32:56.166
We still need to talk to you
about Michael.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.435
BEHOLD:
We're leaving no stone unturned.

32:58.468 --> 33:00.437
I still have nothing
to say to you. Now get out.

33:00.470 --> 33:03.173
What if we were to fix it so you
didn't have to do that anymore?

33:05.542 --> 33:07.344
Stand at the window, crying,

33:07.377 --> 33:10.514
while you double-click
your mouse?

33:10.547 --> 33:12.682
You could do that?

33:12.716 --> 33:15.285
You can make the impulse stop?

33:17.554 --> 33:19.189
Actually, it's only the crying
part I can live without.

33:21.625 --> 33:27.197
The day Constance died
was when I first saw my son.

33:29.333 --> 33:31.335
Grandma?

33:34.038 --> 33:36.040
Grandma!

33:39.743 --> 33:41.745
Grandma?

33:48.385 --> 33:51.588
(crying):
No.

33:55.825 --> 33:59.463
No. Hey. Hey, wake up.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.731
Hey, wake up.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.069
I'm sorry.

34:05.102 --> 34:07.704
I'm so sorry.

34:07.737 --> 34:10.140
It's all my fault.

34:10.174 --> 34:12.576
Hey.

34:12.609 --> 34:13.810
Grandma.

34:13.843 --> 34:15.879
BEN:
The spirits in this house

34:15.912 --> 34:20.084
can't be seen
unless they want to be seen.

34:20.117 --> 34:22.919
She doesn't want to see me?

34:22.952 --> 34:25.322
I'm sorry.

34:25.355 --> 34:28.092
Who are you?

34:28.125 --> 34:31.695
Someone who wants to be seen.

34:31.728 --> 34:33.730
Someone who wants to help.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.035
If you really want to change,
I think I can show you how.

34:39.069 --> 34:42.939
I'm a monster.

34:42.972 --> 34:44.941
Why would you want to help me?

34:44.974 --> 34:47.477
Because I can't help
but think of you as my son.

34:49.613 --> 34:52.749
Even though you're not, really.

34:52.782 --> 34:57.221
And so we started talking,
doctor to patient,

34:57.254 --> 34:58.655
on that very day.

35:00.824 --> 35:04.461
He wanted to be good,
desperately.

35:04.494 --> 35:08.865
I could see in his eyes
how much he needed me.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.434
*

35:10.467 --> 35:12.702
I wanted him to have
all the simple joys

35:12.736 --> 35:15.639
he never had without
a real father to show him how.

35:15.672 --> 35:18.208
* To somebody new... *

35:18.242 --> 35:22.078
He was brilliant,
off the charts.

35:22.112 --> 35:25.582
His brain always seemed five
steps ahead of everyone else.

35:28.185 --> 35:29.486
* Although... *

35:29.519 --> 35:31.121
The more time I spent with him,

35:31.155 --> 35:33.623
the more I began to feel
like a father to this boy.

35:33.657 --> 35:35.259
* You're a part of my heart... *

35:35.292 --> 35:36.960
Everything in this house
was dead.

35:36.993 --> 35:38.895
My wife,

35:38.928 --> 35:40.764
My baby was never going
to grow up.

35:40.797 --> 35:44.634
Violet was never going
to get married.

35:44.668 --> 35:47.271
But Michael was alive,

35:47.304 --> 35:49.339
the only light
to come out of all this.

35:49.373 --> 35:50.740
Ow.

35:50.774 --> 35:53.343
I wanted
to give him everything.

35:53.377 --> 35:57.113
* It will seem
once more just to... *

35:57.147 --> 35:58.715
What are you doing?
Stay away from my shit.

36:00.350 --> 36:02.286
-He was just exploring.
-He's fucked-up.

36:02.319 --> 36:04.120
You stay away from my shit,
you understand?

36:04.154 --> 36:07.123
I just want
to be like you, Dad.

36:09.493 --> 36:10.927
Who told you that?

36:10.960 --> 36:14.264
Other spirits.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.500
They whispered to me.

36:16.533 --> 36:18.568
You didn't spring
from my nutsack, got it?

36:20.003 --> 36:21.705
Not even I could create
something as monstrous,

36:21.738 --> 36:23.173
as evil, as you.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.345
You stay away from me.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.820
BEN:
I could see him turning away.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.758
Turning to the dark side.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.929
And it was about to get worse.

36:47.364 --> 36:51.335
The darkness was always
on the edges.

36:51.368 --> 36:53.637
Encroaching.

36:53.670 --> 36:57.073
It's impossible to avoid
in this house.

37:08.285 --> 37:10.019
What are you doing?

37:13.223 --> 37:16.059
Giving her a smile.

37:16.092 --> 37:20.029
The things you have
to do to be a star.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.765
BEN:
I was losing him.

37:29.773 --> 37:31.941
And then the house sold.

37:31.975 --> 37:33.977
(engine receding)

37:36.079 --> 37:38.248
-Ooh...
-Hey.

37:38.282 --> 37:40.684
That's it, baby.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.386
-We did it.
-Okay.

37:42.419 --> 37:44.421
-Last one.
-Okay.

37:44.454 --> 37:46.790
All right, here we go.

37:46.823 --> 37:49.326
Ooh!

38:01.738 --> 38:03.640
-(knife slices)
-(women screaming)

38:07.311 --> 38:09.112
No, no, no, no!

38:29.198 --> 38:30.867
(panting)

38:32.469 --> 38:34.938
Those were good people.

38:34.971 --> 38:36.673
They deserved a chance.

38:36.706 --> 38:38.942
They don't belong here.

38:38.975 --> 38:41.144
Because of what you did,
they'll be here forever.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.648
(whimpers)

38:44.681 --> 38:46.483
GRACE:
What's happening?

38:47.717 --> 38:49.986
I don't feel right.

38:50.019 --> 38:53.757
You didn't have to kill them.

38:53.790 --> 38:57.160
I know you.
This isn't who you are.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.399
(Grace and Elizabeth screaming)

39:09.906 --> 39:11.741
(grunts)

39:23.219 --> 39:25.355
I never could have helped you.

39:27.023 --> 39:29.659
It was foolish to try.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.142
Michael didn't just kill
those women.

39:46.175 --> 39:50.580
He made them cease to exist.

39:50.614 --> 39:53.417
He murdered their bodies

39:53.450 --> 39:58.087
and then destroyed their souls.

39:58.121 --> 39:59.856
Fuck.

39:59.889 --> 40:03.126
So, basically, our new Supreme
is pretty much pure evil.

40:05.228 --> 40:06.396
We should go.

40:06.430 --> 40:08.064
Cordelia will know what to do.

40:08.097 --> 40:09.699
How to get rid of him.

40:09.733 --> 40:12.602
It won't be so easy.

40:17.941 --> 40:19.108
Vivien.

40:19.142 --> 40:20.910
Ben.

40:21.945 --> 40:24.548
Are we speaking again?

40:24.581 --> 40:27.083
I don't know yet.

40:27.116 --> 40:29.953
Every haunted house
has a cold spot,

40:29.986 --> 40:32.021
and I think we just found it.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.958
I never stopped loving you.

40:34.991 --> 40:37.961
I know.

40:37.994 --> 40:43.600
But I never stopped hating him.

40:43.633 --> 40:46.235
And I couldn't forgive you
for needing Michael.

40:48.838 --> 40:51.240
Although, just now,
I'm starting to realize

40:51.274 --> 40:52.976
maybe you never had a choice.

40:53.009 --> 40:54.243
(baby crying)

40:56.780 --> 40:58.782
Your son needs you, Ben.

40:58.815 --> 41:01.651
He needs his father.

41:11.795 --> 41:13.797
(baby continues crying)

41:17.333 --> 41:20.970
What you're dealing with here
is not just evil.

41:21.004 --> 41:25.675
Michael is not just a bad witch
for you to exterminate.

41:25.709 --> 41:28.277
What is that supposed to mean?

41:28.311 --> 41:33.517
"Then I saw a beast
with ten horns and seven heads

41:33.550 --> 41:36.653
"rising out of the sea

41:36.686 --> 41:40.456
and all who dwell on the Earth
will worship Him."

41:48.164 --> 41:51.701
Nothing about Michael
is natural to me,

41:51.735 --> 41:55.438
not his birth,
not his appearance.

41:55.471 --> 42:00.544
I kept away from him at first
because it was painful.

42:00.577 --> 42:03.312
And then strange things
started to happen.

42:03.346 --> 42:08.384
A murder of crows would
encircle the house every day.

42:11.921 --> 42:15.191
Inside it was sweltering hot.

42:22.198 --> 42:24.601
And then they came.

42:32.008 --> 42:35.011
(doorbell rings)

42:49.225 --> 42:53.029
"And the son became black
as sackcloth with hair,

42:53.062 --> 42:57.200
"and the whole moon
became as blood...

42:57.233 --> 43:01.270
"and the stars fell
from the Heaven to the Earth,

43:01.304 --> 43:04.808
for the great day of wrath
is come."

43:08.144 --> 43:11.214
(gasps)
I am in the presence of my Lord.

43:14.918 --> 43:17.353
Who are you?

43:17.386 --> 43:23.092
I am Anton LaVey, Black Pope
of the Church of Satan,

43:23.126 --> 43:25.929
and these are my cardinals.

43:25.962 --> 43:29.766
I faked my death
to prepare for this day.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.772
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

43:35.805 --> 43:38.574
What's going on here?

43:38.608 --> 43:41.377
We followed a dark star
from the west.

43:41.410 --> 43:43.980
The signs are impossible
to miss:

43:44.013 --> 43:46.449
the temperature in this house,

43:46.482 --> 43:49.452
a home built
over the portal to Hell,

43:49.485 --> 43:52.922
and the crows worshipping
from above.

43:52.956 --> 43:54.457
The omens are complete.

43:54.490 --> 43:56.626
You're the chosen one.

43:56.660 --> 44:00.496
The time has come to remove
the scales from your eyes,

44:00.529 --> 44:03.132
to show you your true power.

44:03.166 --> 44:05.735
VIVIEN:
Something changed in Michael.

44:05.769 --> 44:09.105
It was like they opened a door

44:09.138 --> 44:11.841
and they showed him
his true path.

44:11.875 --> 44:13.643
Why didn't you stop them?

44:13.677 --> 44:15.679
I think I thought it was a joke.

44:15.712 --> 44:19.282
I mean, they were lost souls
following a con man

44:19.315 --> 44:21.417
from some pathetic circus.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.119
That's what it
seemed like to me.

44:23.152 --> 44:25.554
That is, until the Black Mass.

44:46.009 --> 44:49.512
Oh, dear child,
you must be freezing.

44:49.545 --> 44:51.380
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

44:51.414 --> 44:53.850
Thank you.

44:56.585 --> 44:58.988
("(Don't Fear) The Reaper"
by Blue Oyster Cult playing)

44:59.022 --> 45:01.057
You're a lifesaver.

45:04.928 --> 45:07.230
I'm just a couple miles
up Riverside.

45:07.263 --> 45:09.265
* They're gone *

45:10.900 --> 45:13.269
* Seasons don't fear
the reaper *

45:16.906 --> 45:18.207
* La, la, la, la, la... *

45:18.241 --> 45:20.877
You know something, I...

45:20.910 --> 45:22.111
I think I'd rather walk.

45:23.612 --> 45:26.382
It's not going to be possible.

45:29.252 --> 45:30.653
(whimpers)

45:30.686 --> 45:33.322
But it's such a lovely night.

45:33.356 --> 45:34.758
Isn't it?

45:34.791 --> 45:36.760
For what?

45:36.793 --> 45:38.962
Murder.

45:50.974 --> 45:52.909
(moaning)

45:57.781 --> 46:00.549
(door creaks open)

46:00.583 --> 46:03.386
(footfalls approaching)

46:04.387 --> 46:06.389
(gasping)

46:21.004 --> 46:24.774
(chanting in foreign language)

46:43.492 --> 46:45.428
For you, Michael.

46:45.461 --> 46:48.832
It's all for you.

46:48.865 --> 46:50.900
Hail Satan!

46:50.934 --> 46:52.335
(shouts)

46:55.338 --> 46:59.275
(screaming)

47:15.691 --> 47:18.694
LaVEY:
Oh! Oh!

47:24.533 --> 47:26.135
Oh!

47:55.398 --> 47:58.567
*

48:02.738 --> 48:06.109
(Carl Orff's "O Fortuna"
playing)

48:13.416 --> 48:16.552
Ave Satanas.

48:16.585 --> 48:19.022
*

48:36.605 --> 48:39.875
Father.

48:39.909 --> 48:42.478
I am with you now.

48:49.052 --> 48:51.955
VIVIEN: That night
was a terrible storm.

48:51.988 --> 48:56.025
Hail as big as rocks,

48:56.059 --> 48:58.127
rain of blood.

48:58.161 --> 49:02.631
It was then that I made
the decision to kill him.

49:33.129 --> 49:35.531
*

49:45.841 --> 49:49.012
(Vivien screams)

49:50.646 --> 49:52.648
Tate saved me.

49:52.681 --> 49:57.020
And after we put the fire out,
Michael was gone.

49:57.053 --> 49:58.587
I don't know where he went.

49:58.621 --> 50:02.125
I don't know who raised him
after he left.

50:02.158 --> 50:06.029
The only thing I know is, Ben
is not his father, nor is Tate.

50:06.062 --> 50:10.033
He was born from the evil
of this house.

50:10.066 --> 50:15.004
The source of darkness
is his true father,

50:15.038 --> 50:18.474
and he is here
to destroy the world.

50:18.507 --> 50:19.708
BEHOLD:
Madison.

50:19.742 --> 50:21.844
Madison.

50:21.877 --> 50:23.712
Look, I know it sucks

50:23.746 --> 50:25.114
that the guy you put
your hopes into

50:25.148 --> 50:26.949
turned out to be the Antichrist,

50:26.982 --> 50:28.817
but you are not stopping me
from telling the council.

50:28.851 --> 50:30.186
I wasn't gonna stop you.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.956
I never would have fought
for Michael to be Supreme

50:33.989 --> 50:37.193
if I had any idea
about who he truly is.

50:37.226 --> 50:40.996
We just wanted a leader.

50:41.030 --> 50:43.732
But he is clearly not that.

50:43.766 --> 50:46.702
What if we can't stop him?

50:46.735 --> 50:48.204
What happens then?

50:50.206 --> 50:51.540
I don't know.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.944
(soft crying)

51:02.518 --> 51:06.021
(crying)

51:06.055 --> 51:08.691
Give me a second.

51:22.705 --> 51:25.241
If you want to ask me about
Michael, I can't help you.

51:25.274 --> 51:28.944
I stayed clear of him.

51:28.977 --> 51:32.081
Probably a good call.

51:32.115 --> 51:35.284
I think we got enough
on him anyway.

51:35.318 --> 51:36.719
Then what do you want?

51:36.752 --> 51:39.122
Seems like you're having
a hard time.

51:39.155 --> 51:42.391
You and that Tate guy have
a real angsty thing going on.

51:42.425 --> 51:43.826
We don't have anything.

51:45.394 --> 51:47.763
We can't.

51:47.796 --> 51:49.965
He's a monster.

51:49.998 --> 51:51.700
He didn't seem
like a monster to me.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.636
You don't know him.

51:53.669 --> 51:56.239
You can't imagine what it's like

51:56.272 --> 51:58.241
to know all of the horrible
things he's done.

51:58.274 --> 52:01.244
And still be in love with him?

52:02.445 --> 52:06.982
It's torture... every day.

52:07.015 --> 52:10.453
I've done some bad things I'm
not exactly proud of in my life

52:10.486 --> 52:13.556
and my second life.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.324
But those were my choices.

52:15.358 --> 52:19.428
I think what happened to Tate
was different.

52:19.462 --> 52:23.299
He wasn't the real evil here.

52:23.332 --> 52:24.733
What does that even mean?

52:24.767 --> 52:28.804
It's like this house
used him as a vessel

52:28.837 --> 52:31.474
to create something
way, way worse.

52:31.507 --> 52:36.044
My guess: any evil inside Tate
left with Michael.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.851
It would be nice
if that were true.

52:42.885 --> 52:45.488
Maybe you just need to see
the truth for yourself.

53:07.543 --> 53:09.812
*

53:17.520 --> 53:19.255
Tate?

53:29.031 --> 53:30.999
You saved my mom.

53:32.235 --> 53:35.170
I'm so sorry
for everything. I...

53:35.204 --> 53:37.440
I know.

53:39.675 --> 53:42.278
("Spirits in the Material World"
by The Police playing)

53:47.916 --> 53:51.920
* There is
no political solution *

53:54.590 --> 53:57.526
* To our troubled evolution... *

53:57.560 --> 54:00.329
You're really nothing
but a softie, aren't you?

54:00.363 --> 54:02.498
Whatever.

54:02.531 --> 54:04.099
I just thought I'd help
two ghosts get laid.

54:04.132 --> 54:06.735
At least someone's gonna get
a happy ever after.

54:06.769 --> 54:08.904
There's not gonna be
an ever after for anyone

54:08.937 --> 54:10.406
if we don't find a way
to stop Michael.

54:13.609 --> 54:18.447
* We are spirits
in the material world *

54:18.481 --> 54:22.451
* Are spirits
in the material world *

54:22.485 --> 54:25.288
* Are spirits in the
material world *

54:25.321 --> 54:28.924
* Are spirits
in the material world. *
