WEBVTT

01:52.980 --> 01:54.106
Ah!

01:56.240 --> 01:57.355
There you are.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.070
Where am I?

02:02.830 --> 02:05.867
You are at Birch Psychiatric Hospital.

02:06.330 --> 02:07.285
What?

02:08.540 --> 02:09.620
I shouldn't be here.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.450
That's usually
the first thing people say.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.370
Can you loosen these straps?

02:17.550 --> 02:20.849
Ah. That, I'm afraid, I can't do.
Not just yet.

02:21.550 --> 02:23.302
Word is you like
to put up a ﬁght.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.226
I'm not dangerous.

02:26.390 --> 02:29.644
I had a fellow down the hall
say the same thing

02:29.900 --> 02:31.856
just before he bit
the doctor's nose off.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.277
I need to get out of here.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.566
No! Hey, hey, hey!

02:37.740 --> 02:39.947
I know how disorienting
it must be to...

02:40.160 --> 02:42.230
to wake up and find yourself
in a place like this.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.401
But trust me, we're here to help.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.321
And I think I know exactly how.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.411
You need to kill yourself.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.743
It's really the only solution
for any of us.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.675
I mean, look, I have tried four times,
and they keep saving me.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.580
Do it now,
while you have a chance.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.050
Just give me the go-ahead,
and it's done.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.881
Was that a nod?

03:09.060 --> 03:09.970
No.

03:10.230 --> 03:11.094
Yes?

03:12.900 --> 03:13.855
Hey! Hey!

03:14.770 --> 03:16.681
Simon, no!

03:17.940 --> 03:19.521
I was just saying
hello to the new guy.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.534
We're gonna get you cleaned up now.
But first, I need you to swallow these.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.971
I'm going to need
your support on buying

03:53.150 --> 03:54.686
this piece of
property in Brooklyn.

03:55.150 --> 03:56.185
The warehouses?

03:56.940 --> 03:58.100
They important to you?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.850
Ah, business as usual.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.027
Real estate's your domain,
so, sure, I'll back you.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.652
Thank you.
That'll be one less headache.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.072
Speaking of headaches...

04:11.250 --> 04:13.320
What's the latest
with the Danny Rand wannabe?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.911
I still feel
shitty for drugging him.

04:18.460 --> 04:23.295
I can't get over this feeling that maybe,
just maybe...

04:23.470 --> 04:24.459
Don't.

04:25.090 --> 04:28.253
You're just torturing yourself
if you think this might be Danny.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.341
Probably.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.129
But even so...

04:33.640 --> 04:35.016
Let's say you're right.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.181
That would mean that he...

04:38.860 --> 04:42.739
somehow miraculously survived
a plane crash...

04:43.450 --> 04:44.690
in the Himalayas.

04:46.030 --> 04:49.784
And that, for some unknown reason,
he waited 15 years to come back...

04:50.490 --> 04:54.119
with no shoes _
and a tendency toward Violence.

04:54.290 --> 04:55.496
I know...

04:56.000 --> 04:56.955
I know.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.587
We'll get to the bottom of this.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.507
Either way, this is the right thing to do.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.837
This guy, whoever he is,
he needs help,

05:06.010 --> 05:07.295
and we've made
sure he's getting It.

05:09.010 --> 05:10.591
We could have just
had him arrested.

05:12.470 --> 05:13.801
So we're saints.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.472
We're not bad guys,
if that's what you think.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.326
- Oh!
- We're gonna be okay!

05:33.410 --> 05:34.536
Dad!

05:42.420 --> 05:44.047
Did I wake you?

05:44.760 --> 05:45.715
I was meditating.

05:47.050 --> 05:48.677
Is that something you do?

05:49.010 --> 05:50.090
Hmm?

05:50.260 --> 05:53.172
I was trying to focus my chi
so I could get myself out of here.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.090
How'd it work?

05:55.600 --> 05:56.726
It didn't.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.430
It's the drugs.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.356
You need to let me out of here.

06:02.940 --> 06:06.444
Well, it's either here or jail.
But I have you for 72 hours,

06:06.610 --> 06:08.658
so I think we should
make the most of it.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.190
Can, can you at least
unstrap me?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.246
Are you gonna behave?

06:17.620 --> 06:18.530
Yeah.

06:25.460 --> 06:26.666
Let's start with this...

06:39.060 --> 06:40.641
Let's find out what's going on.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.140
First off, what's your name?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.560
Danny Rand.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.021
Like that rich kid
who died in a plane crash?

06:50.320 --> 06:52.868
I am that rich kid
who died in a plane crash.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.827
Okay, obviously I... I didn't die.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.377
Why don't you
tell me about that?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.251
We... We crashed.

07:08.510 --> 07:09.545
And then?

07:13.180 --> 07:14.169
And then...

07:18.140 --> 07:19.346
I woke up.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.068
I was in this huge snowa’r/ﬁ

07:27.030 --> 07:27.985
I was hurt.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.520
It was snowing.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.326
You must have been cold.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.236
I was cold.

07:39.410 --> 07:42.573
But I could see pieces of the plane
scattered over the mountainside. I...

07:43.790 --> 07:44.950
I had to go and check.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.677
I found the cockpit first.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.459
Both pilots were dead.

07:59.310 --> 08:00.800
Then I found the main fuselage.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.356
My dad was inside.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.605
I love you, Danny.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.276
Wendell Rand?

08:16.410 --> 08:17.479
Yeah.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.240
And he was dead, too?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.547
What about your mother?

08:31.840 --> 08:32.966
Was she there, too?

08:34.010 --> 08:35.045
No.

08:36.050 --> 08:37.460
No? Where was she?

08:39.100 --> 08:41.341
Stay in your seat.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.436
Heather...

08:45.980 --> 08:47.299
We got you, Danny.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.270
Mum! Mum!

08:53.320 --> 08:54.526
I don't know.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.611
So what did you do?

09:00.160 --> 09:01.616
I didn't want to leave my dad.

09:02.790 --> 09:03.950
Okay.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.661
But I was so cold.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.286
I was thirsty, hungry.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.291
I... I had to try.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.540
Try what?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.086
To survive.

09:16.970 --> 09:18.426
I stepped out, but the...

09:19.810 --> 09:21.801
The snow was so deep,
the wind, I...

09:22.890 --> 09:24.175
I kept on falling, and...

09:26.310 --> 09:27.846
Suddenly, I looked up, and...

09:29.900 --> 09:33.108
...there were these two
men stand/ng above me.

09:34.150 --> 09:35.447
Chodak and Tashi.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.480
And who were they?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.149
Monks.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.979
Order of the Crane Mother.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.110
Wow. Monks...

09:47.000 --> 09:49.833
...of the Order of the Crane Mother?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.627
What kind of monks are those?

09:52.340 --> 09:53.659
They were warrior monks.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.169
Okay.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.649
Let's just put that on hold for a moment
and switch gears.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.278
Why don't we talk
about what happened with John Anderson?

10:19.360 --> 10:20.361
Who's that?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.405
Well, isn't that you?

10:34.340 --> 10:36.331
This is your passport, isn't it?

10:38.840 --> 10:39.795
That's your picture.

10:39.970 --> 10:42.677
John Anderson of Toronto, Canada.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.301
I... I've never seen that before.

10:56.860 --> 10:58.066
If you want out of here...

10:59.700 --> 11:01.986
you're gonna have to start
being honest with me.

11:06.580 --> 11:07.990
We'll talk about this some more.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.351
Yeah, man!

13:06.700 --> 13:08.440
You might want to sound
a little less...

13:08.950 --> 13:10.360
like a...

13:10.540 --> 13:11.859
You guys are no good!

13:12.040 --> 13:13.359
Like a fat duck, Darryl.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.781
I could hear those feet slapping
on the sidewalk a block away.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.621
Yes, sensei.
My shoes are too big.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.451
And I could smell your garlic breath
before you walked out your door.

13:20.630 --> 13:21.619
Sorry, sensei.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.462
And what the hell was that, Jenny?
What are you doing, yoga?

13:24.630 --> 13:26.507
You move about as
fast as a pIg...

13:27.390 --> 13:29.847
swimming in gravy.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.630
I can't.

13:33.810 --> 13:36.552
If I say anything,
I'll just end up crying.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.891
This was a fail, guys.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.521
These exercises
are about trying to teach you

13:44.690 --> 13:46.146
how to perform in the real world, so...

13:47.490 --> 13:48.479
do better.

13:53.830 --> 13:54.956
You ready?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.915
What's he doing here?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.409
He's your tour guide.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.335
You gonna try and stab me?

14:07.720 --> 14:08.926
Sorry about that.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.386
I get stressed.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.613
They call this a hospital,
but don't let that fool you.

14:37.620 --> 14:38.575
Huh.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.627
The big one, Dink...

14:41.420 --> 14:42.876
murdered his parents with a hammer.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.456
Got off with an insanity plea.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.752
Leo fried his brains
with methamphetamines

14:48.930 --> 14:52.468
and Tony is... just an idiot.

15:03.730 --> 15:04.765
Let it go.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.139
Let it go.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.021
And this is your home.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.367
Not much to look at, I know.

15:13.990 --> 15:16.948
I'll be out in 72 hours.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.753
That what they tell you?
72 hours?

15:30.930 --> 15:34.593
Me, I had a little incident
inside a pharmacy.

15:35.180 --> 15:39.765
Seventy-two hours later, I'm a bipolar
with mixed affective episodes,

15:39.940 --> 15:43.091
layered atop
a substance abuse disorder.

15:43.650 --> 15:45.766
That was two years ago.

15:45.940 --> 15:48.852
Billy was living
under a bridge.

15:49.030 --> 15:52.909
Seventy-two hours later,
he's a paranoid personality disorder.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.231
That was just over a year ago.

15:56.620 --> 16:01.569
And Jimmy was screaming
at people in Times Square.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.664
Seventy-two hours later,
he's a schizoaffective disorder.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.450
He's been here almost 15 years.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.119
Don't think you'll be any different.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.176
I need to get out of here.

16:18.350 --> 16:20.671
Yeah. Well, we all want out.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.516
That's why they dope
us every eight hours

16:23.690 --> 16:25.726
until we are just
mindless donkeys.

16:29.820 --> 16:30.889
Who you calling donkey?

16:31.070 --> 16:34.699
Oh, no. I'm sorry. My mistake.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.157
You apologise, too.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.406
For... For what?

16:39.040 --> 16:39.995
For being alive.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.535
That's just stupid.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.491
Apologise now, or I'm going to hurt you.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.621
Remind me what's wrong
with this one again?

16:52.260 --> 16:53.579
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, you!

16:53.760 --> 16:54.624
- Whoa!
- Whoa! No! No!

16:54.800 --> 16:55.789
You're out of here!

16:55.970 --> 16:56.925
He started it! He started it!

16:57.100 --> 16:59.091
No! No! It's okay,
Danny! It's okay!

16:59.260 --> 17:00.716
It's okay, Danny!
It's okay!

17:04.100 --> 17:05.226
Open.

17:05.690 --> 17:06.725
Why?

17:27.130 --> 17:28.586
Are you okay, Danny?

17:31.920 --> 17:32.875
What?

17:34.130 --> 17:35.711
It's nothing. It's just...

17:37.470 --> 17:39.426
You're the first person
to call me Danny in here.

17:42.970 --> 17:44.380
I need to get out of this place.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.096
Do you have any family you can call?

17:49.150 --> 17:50.219
No.

17:51.730 --> 17:52.719
Fnends?

17:57.570 --> 17:58.980
Is there a phone I can use?

18:02.660 --> 18:06.039
I'm not supposed to do this,
but what are they going to do?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.700
Put me in the nut house?

18:15.470 --> 18:17.370
- Ch/kara Dojo.
- Hey...

18:17.970 --> 18:19.676
- It’s Danny.
- Who?

18:19.970 --> 18:21.005
Danny.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.921
You, uh, you met me at the park. Uh...

18:24.100 --> 18:26.091
I looked you up at your o’ojo.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.515
Why are you calling me?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.851
I'm at the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.

18:31.650 --> 18:33.060
Uh. I need your help.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.140
Why would you come to me for help?

18:35.320 --> 18:37.026
You're the only person I know in New York

18:37.200 --> 18:39.521
who doesn't want to kill me
or put me In a mental hospital.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.445
Then I might want to rethink that.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.327
No, listen. I'm not crazy, okay?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.577
They drugged me. They... They...
They brought me here against my will.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.201
You saw me being attacked the other night.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.415
You know there's something going on.

18:58.090 --> 19:00.297
Why would anyone be after you
in the first place?

19:00.550 --> 19:02.711
You'll have to ask
the Meachums, okay?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.762
Aren't they, like, one of the richest
families in New York?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.386
- Yeah.
- And they have a problem with you?

19:09.520 --> 19:10.760
Yeah, they do.

19:12.270 --> 19:15.683
Look, Danny, it sounds
like maybe you're in trouble,

19:15.860 --> 19:17.771
but I just don't think
I'm the person to help.

19:17.940 --> 19:19.020
No, Colleen...

19:19.780 --> 19:21.566
You are the only person
who can help me.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.190
Really, I'm sorry.

19:24.370 --> 19:25.860
No, please...

19:37.880 --> 19:38.915
Dad.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.560
Take a look at this.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.992
...suo’o’en/y,
I looked up, and there were these...

20:13.170 --> 20:14.569
You put cameras in there?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.706
It's the let century.
We're all connected.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.416
Chodak ano’ Tash/Z

20:19.380 --> 20:20.711
And who were they?

20:21.170 --> 20:23.297
Mon/(s.
Order of the Crane Mother.

20:25.010 --> 20:27.752
See, he talks about being
rescued by two monks.

20:28.510 --> 20:30.592
- Is that possible?
- Well, anything's possible.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.055
What doesn't make sense...

20:33.270 --> 20:34.897
is there are no monasteries

20:35.360 --> 20:38.261
anywhere near where contact
with the plane was lost.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.238
And Order of the Crane Mother...

20:41.900 --> 20:42.980
doesn't exist.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.988
Unless Kyle is an idiot who doesn't know
how to do simple research.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.788
No. Sir, there's no mention of it
anywhere.

20:54.290 --> 20:58.829
But he's said enough that makes me think
that this might actually be Danny Rand,

20:59.300 --> 21:00.506
back from the dead.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.758
I've been giving a lot of thought
about what to do with him.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.999
Oh?

21:06.260 --> 21:10.048
Unfortunately, lobotomies are a thing
of the past, but...

21:10.470 --> 21:11.926
there are still a lot of countries

21:12.100 --> 21:14.182
that are pretty free
with psychosurgery,

21:14.350 --> 21:16.477
which can potentially
have the same effect.

21:16.650 --> 21:17.799
No, no, no, no.

21:17.980 --> 21:20.312
- Or even just heaw doses of Thorazine...
- No!

21:20.480 --> 21:22.562
Dad! We have to deal with this.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.856
We can't deal with it
until we know what we have.

21:25.030 --> 21:27.191
He's only given us a few clues.

21:27.530 --> 21:31.899
No, we need to know more before we can,
uh, decide how we should proceed.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.320
So we just wait?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.821
Yeah. And watch.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.951
Oh, there is one thing you can do.

21:39.130 --> 21:43.294
Danny, if this is Danny, has only made one
phone call out, to a...

21:43.460 --> 21:46.509
Colleen Wing. She runs a dojo near
Chinatown.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.296
I'd like you to go and talk to her.

21:50.010 --> 21:51.386
See what she knows...

21:52.520 --> 21:53.805
why he called her.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.434
I have to do this?
Why don't you send one of your guys?

22:01.440 --> 22:04.739
You are one of my guys, one of my most
trusted guys.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.947
Do this for me.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.786
How you feeling this morning?

23:02.290 --> 23:04.121
Drugs make me feel like I'm under water.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.831
We've got you on some pretty high doses,

23:09.180 --> 23:12.502
but I understand
that's what it takes with you.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.592
You haven't been as cooperative
as we'd like.

23:19.730 --> 23:20.845
I lied...

23:22.440 --> 23:23.680
about the passport.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.988
Okay, well,
that's a step in the right direction.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.526
So you're ready to be John Anderson?

23:38.960 --> 23:40.359
I bought the passport in Morocco.

23:41.210 --> 23:42.370
It's stolen.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.331
I know it's a federal crime, but...

23:46.500 --> 23:48.548
it's the only way I could get back
into the States.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.250
I'm not John Anderson.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.500
I'm Danny Rand.

23:56.970 --> 23:59.222
We'll talk about it in our next session.
How's that?

24:20.910 --> 24:22.866
Keep practicing your kata.

24:23.460 --> 24:24.996
At least an hour a day.

24:29.550 --> 24:30.665
Excuse me.

24:31.590 --> 24:33.217
Are you Colleen Wing?

24:34.800 --> 24:35.880
Iam.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.880
I'm sorry to intrude.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.925
My name is Ward Meachum.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.646
What can I do for you?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.238
Well, this is rather awkward.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.784
I'm wondering if you've had any contact
with a man who's going by the name Danny?

25:01.330 --> 25:03.241
Mid-twenties, homeless...

25:03.830 --> 25:04.819
no shoes?

25:07.340 --> 25:08.409
Why do you ask?

25:08.590 --> 25:11.753
It's personal.
That's why I've come here myself.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.798
He's threatened me, as well as my sister.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.038
Really?

25:17.220 --> 25:19.381
He actually held a gun to my head.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.800
Why would he do that?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.977
Honestly...

25:25.140 --> 25:27.608
I_ think he has
some serious mental problems.

25:29.020 --> 25:31.978
Uh... Okay, so how did you find me?

25:32.320 --> 25:35.278
Because of the threat, we've had someone
keep an eye on him,

25:35.450 --> 25:38.066
note anyone
that he might be in contact with.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.230
Your name was on the list.

25:40.410 --> 25:43.288
Yeah, look...
I don't know the guy.

25:43.870 --> 25:45.155
But you've met him?

25:45.750 --> 25:47.377
He came around here once.

25:51.000 --> 25:51.989
Did he...

25:53.210 --> 25:54.256
hurt you...

25:54.970 --> 25:56.039
in any way?

25:57.550 --> 25:59.347
That'd be a mistake.

26:01.510 --> 26:04.092
It would be very helpful for us

26:04.270 --> 26:06.511
if you would be willing to sign some
papers

26:06.690 --> 26:11.559
that would attest
that you felt threatened by him.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.020
Threatened?

26:16.450 --> 26:18.520
Hmm...
Yeah, I don't think so.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.235
Look”.

26:23.330 --> 26:26.288
it's for his own protection as well.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.667
The man needs help.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.041
And as a token of thanks,

26:34.630 --> 26:38.214
I think Rand would be happy to set up a...

26:39.140 --> 26:42.212
...neighbourhood improvement donation...

26:44.020 --> 26:45.385
...to be spent however you choose.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.879
Move your damn car!

26:48.770 --> 26:49.839
How about this?

26:51.150 --> 26:54.062
I'll have some papers drawn up,
simply say the man...

26:55.360 --> 26:56.770
acted unusually...

26:57.900 --> 26:59.527
made you feel uncomfortable.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.519
I just don't think...

27:02.700 --> 27:04.236
I'll give you some time to think about it.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.860
You'd be doing us a great favour.

27:10.330 --> 27:11.786
Bit of money would really...

27:12.540 --> 27:14.167
bring this place up a notch.

27:26.350 --> 27:27.339
Come in.

27:33.650 --> 27:36.642
I was gonna show you this later,
but since you're already here...

27:39.950 --> 27:40.985
What is it?

27:42.820 --> 27:45.448
It's a commercial I found
from about 15 years ago.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.997
...understand/hg that the most
important products

27:48.160 --> 27:50.071
are the ones that power lives...

27:51.170 --> 27:53.786
- That boy... That's Danny Rand.
- We are Rand.I

27:55.460 --> 27:58.258
I'm sure it was real nice to be part of
that family.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.081
Have all the money in the world.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.631
Look how happy they seem.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.514
Sometimes, when our own lives are a
struggle, it's...

28:08.270 --> 28:11.307
Easier to imagine
we belong to some other world.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.976
Some happier world.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.774
Right after we shot this, we all went
to the circus in Madison Square Garden.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.145
I didn't want to do the commercial.

28:23.570 --> 28:25.982
It's how Dad talked me into it.

28:26.370 --> 28:27.359
The circus.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.860
Yeah.

28:32.790 --> 28:34.667
The acrobats were amazing.

28:36.670 --> 28:38.740
And I sat next to my mum.

28:39.670 --> 28:41.160
Joy was on the other side.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.297
We had popcorn.

28:46.930 --> 28:50.639
John Anderson. That's your name.
You are not Danny Rand.

28:51.890 --> 28:55.348
I am Danny Rand.
I don't care what you think!

28:57.020 --> 29:00.069
Here we go. Come on.
Come on. Calm down.

29:11.830 --> 29:13.707
Come on. Get him up.

29:17.920 --> 29:22.334
Ask him where he's been the last 15 years.
Ask him why he's suddenly come back now?

29:24.760 --> 29:26.000
Jesus.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.762
We actually get a shrink who's trying to
help the guy.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.760
Sorry.

29:33.020 --> 29:35.011
Why are you always saying sorry to me?

29:35.640 --> 29:38.438
You're like some scared little rabbit
who's always apologlsmg.

29:39.610 --> 29:40.508
Sor. ..

29:41.360 --> 29:43.430
I'll... I'll... I'll try not to do that.

29:43.610 --> 29:46.238
I don't give a shit what you do, Kyle.
I'm just pointing it out.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.230
For your own betterment.

29:49.410 --> 29:50.729
Thank you, sir.

29:50.910 --> 29:55.609
See, what's really interesting is I think
this might actually be Danny Rand.

29:57.250 --> 29:58.820
I have no clue how that's possible.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.707
And this guy here, he's not asking the
right questions.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.620
Sorry...

30:04.260 --> 30:06.000
Oh, you can't help yourself, can you?

30:09.470 --> 30:11.097
You know what my dad used to do?

30:12.350 --> 30:14.227
Whenever I messed up, which...

30:14.810 --> 30:18.394
according to my dad was pretty much all
the time. He would...

30:19.230 --> 30:21.858
whip me across the back with his belt.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.685
And with each...

30:24.570 --> 30:26.106
I'd have to apologise...

30:26.900 --> 30:29.277
for forcing him to exert himself.

30:31.950 --> 30:33.190
God, I miss him.

30:35.910 --> 30:37.150
But now...

30:37.670 --> 30:39.956
I don't apologise for anything.

30:46.130 --> 30:49.338
Kyle, get the car ready tonight.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.098
- The car?
- Yeah, the thing with the four wheels.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.342
Oh. Yes, sir, it's just...

30:56.600 --> 30:58.227
you never leave the penthouse.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.142
Oh, I'm thinking it's time.

31:33.930 --> 31:35.386
Okay, put him on.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.709
Uh, Joy Meachum?

31:36.970 --> 31:39.598
This is Dr Paul Edmonds from
the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.

31:39.770 --> 31:42.147
I ’m treating the patient
your fam/ly admitted

31:42.440 --> 31:44.010
Yes, how can I help you?

31:44.360 --> 31:47.272
I ’m wondering if I can ask you
an odd question.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.396
Uh... Okay.

31:49.610 --> 31:51.601
Uh. Years ago,
when you were about 10 years old,

31:51.780 --> 31:53.907
you did a commercial for Rand?

31:54.070 --> 31:56.152
Uh-huh. Yeah. "We are Rand."

31:56.830 --> 31:58.946
Anything else stick out about that day?

32:03.420 --> 32:05.741
They put me in a stupid dress.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.912
It was cold out. I don ’t know.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.620
Did you do anything afterwards?

32:11.880 --> 32:13.040
Oh, yeah.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.840
The circus.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.466
Yeah, we all went to the circus
afterwards.

32:18.390 --> 32:19.345
You're sure?

32:20.770 --> 32:22.726
Yeah. Yeah, it was Danny's idea.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.978
He didn ’1' want to do the commercial,
and his parents had to hr/be h/m.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.988
I remember because he wanted
to be an acrobat after that.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.811
He was always jumping around.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.111
Okay. Well, uh, thank you.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.116
That's it?

32:37.280 --> 32:40.443
Um. Yeah, it was... It was
an odd question. Why do you ask?

32:40.620 --> 32:43.999
I'm afraid I can't really say.
Patient confidentiality.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.918
Well, now you have me curious.

32:48.210 --> 32:49.871
Sony. Wish I could say more.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.180
Hello, Danny.

33:50.900 --> 33:52.106
Harold?

33:55.240 --> 33:59.313
Do you remember
that song I used to sing...

34:01.080 --> 34:03.071
that would annoy the shit out of you?

34:03.750 --> 34:04.785
Um...

34:07.960 --> 34:09.279
"Danny Boy."

34:09.920 --> 34:10.955
Right?

34:12.250 --> 34:13.376
Yeah.

34:23.430 --> 34:25.011
And I am dead

34:25.600 --> 34:28.899
As dead I well may he

34:30.310 --> 34:35.270
And you wﬂl come
And ﬁnd the place where

34:35.740 --> 34:38.231
I am lying

34:39.570 --> 34:41.447
And kneel and say

34:42.740 --> 34:45.868
An ,4 ve there for me

34:47.250 --> 34:50.458
- I thought you were dead.
- And I thought you were dead...

34:51.210 --> 34:53.417
so I guess that's something
we have in common.

34:54.710 --> 34:55.870
I didn't die.

35:01.180 --> 35:05.924
Uh. I understand you were...
taken in by some monks.

35:07.100 --> 35:10.399
What? Order of the, uh, Crane Mother?

35:11.020 --> 35:12.055
Yeah.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.606
How did you know?

35:14.820 --> 35:17.277
Oh, we dead know a lot.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.356
But not everything.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.828
Where exactly is this monastery?

35:24.030 --> 35:25.577
Hey.

35:26.580 --> 35:28.286
Where is the monastery?

35:30.710 --> 35:31.870
K'un-Lun.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.331
It's one of
the Seven Capital Cities of Heaven.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.831
I probably never should have left.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.086
At least I understood my place there.

35:42.260 --> 35:44.342
Oh, and what was your place?

35:45.140 --> 35:46.209
I was a warrior.

35:48.890 --> 35:51.597
Only in the middle of a fight
did I fully come alive.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.522
The harder someone hit me, the...

35:57.440 --> 35:59.351
the more everything came into focus.

36:01.070 --> 36:02.059
Oh.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.902
What kind of warrior are you?

36:06.240 --> 36:08.117
Hey, listen to me.

36:08.620 --> 36:10.247
What do you mean you're a warrior?

36:12.330 --> 36:14.378
I became one in a long line...

36:15.290 --> 36:16.996
of Immortal Iron Fists.

36:18.670 --> 36:19.830
Living Weapon.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.216
The sworn enemy of the Hand.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.632
Wait, what's that? Sworn enemy of who?

36:25.390 --> 36:27.210
The sworn enemy of the Hand.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.096
What exactly does that mean?

36:30.640 --> 36:33.222
It is my duty to destroy the Hand.

36:34.810 --> 36:38.564
And this is something you can do?
You can destroy the Hand?

36:39.820 --> 36:41.981
I am the only one who can do it.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.286
Please...

36:49.620 --> 36:51.747
Harold, you have to get me out of here.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.663
Oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

36:55.790 --> 36:57.200
Right now...

36:58.880 --> 37:00.950
you should just go back to sleep.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.808
Look up everything you can
on the Iron Fist.

37:08.970 --> 37:10.676
Iron Fist. Yes, sir.

38:27.220 --> 38:28.676
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

38:29.930 --> 38:30.965
Hey...

38:32.430 --> 38:35.843
Does this look like the guy who was in
here the other day?

38:37.690 --> 38:39.226
I couldn't really say.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.641
This whole thing has me so rattled.
I'm... Ijust...

38:46.740 --> 38:50.733
You know, if this really is Danny,
then what we're doing to him...

38:51.070 --> 38:52.446
it's pretty shitty.

38:53.330 --> 38:55.195
You said it's probably not him.

38:55.370 --> 38:56.701
Yeah. Probably not.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.206
Well, if it is him,

39:00.380 --> 39:02.371
he's going about proving it in a really
strange way.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.916
Honestly, what other options does he have?

39:24.480 --> 39:26.983
I need to have this messengered somewhere.

39:56.810 --> 39:57.708
Hi.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.096
Me again.

40:00.310 --> 40:04.189
Sorry to interrupt,
but I was hoping we could make a trade.

40:06.230 --> 40:07.310
Oh, yeah?

40:08.150 --> 40:09.185
What kind of trade?

40:09.360 --> 40:11.817
If you sign these...

40:13.740 --> 40:14.980
then".

40:16.030 --> 40:18.578
I will leave you this.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.210
$50,000?

40:34.850 --> 40:36.465
This must be very important to you.

40:36.640 --> 40:37.675
It is.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.342
If I sign this, then what do you do?

40:42.980 --> 40:46.017
I just want everyone to be safe.

40:46.190 --> 40:50.149
My sister, you, myself,
even the man in question.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.100
With your backing,

40:52.280 --> 40:55.738
I can assure that he gets the long-term
help that he needs.

41:19.890 --> 41:21.050
Heather!

41:34.110 --> 41:35.486
Special delivery.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.401
What is it?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.491
From Joy Meachum.

42:16.070 --> 42:17.310
You have a visitor.

42:19.030 --> 42:20.019
Is it Joy?

42:46.600 --> 42:48.841
- You okay?
- No.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.148
They've got me
on all kinds of drugs.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.389
Why?

42:56.070 --> 42:58.061
To keep me safe.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.281
Didn't expect to see you.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.319
You figure out a way
to get me out of here?

43:22.180 --> 43:25.422
Why would Ward Meachum want me to sign
papers that say you're dangerous?

43:28.100 --> 43:29.977
Because the family thinks
I'm a threat to them.

43:30.150 --> 43:31.936
And why would they think that?

43:32.110 --> 43:33.975
I'm guessing because I'm Danny Rand

43:34.150 --> 43:36.436
and I probably own more
than half the company.

43:38.070 --> 43:40.857
Wait a minute. _
Danny Rand, as In Rand Enterprises?

43:41.570 --> 43:42.525
Yeah.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.621
It couldn't be something simple.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.535
It is simple.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.000
The Meachums are trying to bribe me.

44:02.510 --> 44:03.716
They got plenty of money.

44:07.310 --> 44:08.720
You gonna sign the papers?

44:10.060 --> 44:11.300
Are you dangerous?

44:11.940 --> 44:13.089
To them?

44:14.940 --> 44:16.066
Very dangerous.

44:17.030 --> 44:18.224
And to me?

44:18.940 --> 44:20.942
No, of course not.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.401
You must know that. Otherwise,
why would you come here to see me?

44:24.570 --> 44:25.650
I don't know shit.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.787
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.617
Every word I have ever told you
is the truth.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.006
Okay.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.332
Okay. But, really,
I can't be involved in this.

44:43.010 --> 44:43.886
Okay.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.629
I understand.

44:51.430 --> 44:52.761
Uh. Just one last favour.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.089
What?

44:57.730 --> 44:59.220
Deliver these to Joy Meachum.

45:03.490 --> 45:04.605
Someone's here to see you.

45:05.530 --> 45:06.770
A Colleen Wing.

45:06.950 --> 45:09.077
She says she has a message from Danny.

45:09.370 --> 45:10.496
Show her in.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.086
Thanks.

45:23.510 --> 45:25.421
I got no clue what I'm doing here.

45:27.350 --> 45:28.840
Danny asked me to give this to you.

45:49.240 --> 45:51.652
Oh, my God.

45:52.660 --> 45:53.957
It is Danny.

46:01.170 --> 46:03.297
Let your brother know
I'm not signing these.

46:09.970 --> 46:11.346
My God.

46:26.990 --> 46:28.901
What was Colleen Wing doing here?

46:35.750 --> 46:36.910
She didn't sign them.

46:38.540 --> 46:42.169
Danny sent all but the brown M&M's.

46:43.510 --> 46:45.330
That supposed to mean something?

46:45.510 --> 46:46.579
Yes.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.467
When... When we were kids...

46:51.140 --> 46:54.018
We would eat them together.
All but the brown ones.

46:55.230 --> 46:56.970
Nobody would know that but Danny.

46:58.020 --> 47:01.729
Joy, I'm sorry, but a bunch of M&M's
doesn't prove anything.

47:02.570 --> 47:03.685
It does.

47:04.150 --> 47:06.948
This is Danny, Ward.

47:07.110 --> 47:11.069
I have been in denial this whole time,
but this is definite proof.

47:11.950 --> 47:14.942
We gotta get him out of that place.
We've... We've got to talk to him.

47:15.120 --> 47:18.362
No, Joy. Not now.
We've already discussed this.

47:18.540 --> 47:21.532
Whoever he is,
he is in a safe place right now.

47:21.710 --> 47:25.089
The best thing to do is wait until we get
a full report from the doctors there,

47:25.550 --> 47:27.120
and then we can consider our next step.

47:27.300 --> 47:28.676
Ward, no...

47:28.840 --> 47:30.888
Joy, I insist.

47:32.100 --> 47:35.592
Jesus, Ward, what are you so afraid of?

47:36.600 --> 47:39.683
You should be a little more like dad.
Yeah? Grow some balls.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.899
I was just going to see you.

47:56.660 --> 47:58.537
My 72 hours are almost up.

47:59.580 --> 48:00.956
Time to let me go.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.372
I'm gonna be making that decision
very soon.

48:07.170 --> 48:08.876
I did a little research last night,

48:09.050 --> 48:11.541
and, uh, I want to ask you a few
questions.

48:14.470 --> 48:16.301
When you were a kid,
where did you go to school?

48:16.470 --> 48:17.459
Um...

48:18.470 --> 48:20.301
Down the hall to our library.

48:21.270 --> 48:24.979
I was home-schooled.
My, uh... My mum taught me.

48:25.980 --> 48:27.060
Any other teachers?

48:28.440 --> 48:29.520
There was, uh...

48:30.280 --> 48:33.192
Mrs Valdez for art.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.863
Mrs Krol for music.

48:39.620 --> 48:42.578
Mr Miller, PE.

48:49.130 --> 48:50.916
How does this make sense?

48:52.340 --> 48:53.716
How does what make sense?

49:02.310 --> 49:03.379
Danny...

49:07.020 --> 49:09.022
And I do mean Danny, because...

49:10.320 --> 49:12.481
I believe you're the real Danny Rand.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.861
Where have you been the last 15 years?

49:21.410 --> 49:24.163
I've... I've been away.

49:24.330 --> 49:27.083
Away, yes. I know. But where?

49:27.250 --> 49:31.835
What... What you said before about, uh,
a monastery, is that all true?

49:32.670 --> 49:33.671
Yeah.

49:34.510 --> 49:35.499
In China?

49:35.930 --> 49:37.136
In, in K'un-Lun.

49:38.470 --> 49:40.381
K'un-Lun. Where is that?

49:42.560 --> 49:44.380
It exists in another dimension.

49:45.940 --> 49:47.259
Another dimension?

49:47.730 --> 49:48.890
Yeah.

49:49.440 --> 49:52.568
It only appears on this earthly plane
every fifteen years,

49:53.030 --> 49:55.851
give or take,
depending on the celestial tilt.

49:56.030 --> 49:57.065
Oh.

49:59.120 --> 50:02.863
Is this all a part of you trying to focus
your chi?

50:03.040 --> 50:04.109
Yeah.

50:04.410 --> 50:06.458
IfI can focus my chi,

50:06.620 --> 50:08.668
then I can summon the Iron Fist.

50:09.790 --> 50:12.088
And the Iron Fist is...

50:13.300 --> 50:14.961
The Iron Fist is...

50:15.510 --> 50:16.829
It's me.

50:22.430 --> 50:23.556
Can I go now?

50:24.600 --> 50:29.139
Are you Danny Rand,
or are you the Iron Fist?

50:30.480 --> 50:31.765
I'm... I'm both.

50:38.030 --> 50:39.156
Danny...

50:42.240 --> 50:45.323
I believe you've been through
some great trauma.

50:45.500 --> 50:49.573
Your plane crashed. You lost your parents,
you barely survived yourself.

50:49.750 --> 50:54.255
And I'm guessing things didn't get better
after that. I believe all that.

50:55.670 --> 50:57.171
But the rest...

50:59.090 --> 51:03.459
Danny, sometimes when our circumstances
are too overwhelming to deal with,

51:03.640 --> 51:05.631
we create a false reality,

51:06.060 --> 51:07.266
one that...

51:07.440 --> 51:10.477
helps us deal with the loss and suffering.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.145
I, uh...

51:12.320 --> 51:17.735
We, we give ourselves superpowers,
secret identities, iron fists...

51:19.410 --> 51:23.153
things that make us feel strong, special.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.742
I... I... I don't think I understand.

51:25.910 --> 51:27.787
If you want me to give it a medical label,

51:27.960 --> 51:31.168
I'm gonna suggest that you have
an anxiety disorder

51:31.330 --> 51:32.581
with psychotic features.

51:32.750 --> 51:33.876
Wait, no.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.336
No, this should be taken as good news,

51:35.420 --> 51:38.162
because now it means we can make a plan
for treatment.

51:38.670 --> 51:40.297
I don't want to make
any false predictions.

51:40.470 --> 51:41.926
This... this will take time.

51:42.890 --> 51:45.597
No, you need to let me out of here.

51:45.770 --> 51:49.592
Danny, for your own safety,
I can't release you now.

52:00.860 --> 52:02.407
I'm telling the truth.

52:03.410 --> 52:05.275
I have the power of the Iron Fist.

52:06.660 --> 52:08.537
IfI can summon my chi,
I can...

52:08.700 --> 52:12.158
I can focus my energy into my hand,

52:12.330 --> 52:14.582
creating a powerful weapon.

52:15.210 --> 52:16.336
Okay.

52:16.710 --> 52:19.042
That's a new one on me, but...

52:19.550 --> 52:23.964
I do know that ever since the incident,
I'm seeing a lot more people

52:24.220 --> 52:26.347
who honestly believe
they have super powers.

52:26.510 --> 52:28.978
I am the Iron Fist.

52:29.230 --> 52:30.845
I'm happy for you to convince me.

52:31.020 --> 52:33.261
Do... Do you want to show me
the Iron Fist?

52:33.440 --> 52:34.930
Let's see how it works.

52:47.620 --> 52:48.575
I can't.

52:53.330 --> 52:55.537
Not until you take me off these drugs.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.837
What I'd like for you to do...

53:01.170 --> 53:06.005
is to open yourself to the possibility
that there is no Iron Fist.

53:10.020 --> 53:13.183
Just... Danny Rand.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.220
A young man...

53:16.400 --> 53:19.528
who suffered an unspeakable tragedy.

53:29.410 --> 53:30.820
We 7/ talk about this tomorrow.

53:34.420 --> 53:37.708
Looks like more people are beginning
to realise this is the real Danny Rand.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.756
I found nothing on Iron Fist.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.832
There's a beer named Iron Fist,
a clothing line,

53:46.010 --> 53:47.796
but nothing helpful.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.379
A mystery.

54:07.780 --> 54:09.862
As it stands, purchasing this property

54:10.030 --> 54:12.407
will provide an inroad
to domestic production,

54:12.580 --> 54:15.538
which will prove very valuable
down the line.

54:20.290 --> 54:21.370
Excuse me.

54:29.850 --> 54:31.806
Sorry, I have to take this.

54:37.980 --> 54:40.392
- What?
- Oh, you sound a little testy.

54:40.560 --> 54:44.144
I was in the middle of a meeting,
a meeting about buying warehouses

54:44.320 --> 54:47.483
in Brooklyn, which I'm only holding
because you insisted.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.025
Well, this is more important.

54:49.990 --> 54:51.730
I'm listening.

54:52.830 --> 54:56.869
I've become convinced that_ our friend
IS who he says he IS.

54:57.790 --> 54:58.950
We need to have him moved.

54:59.130 --> 55:01.200
As soon as poss/b/e. Ton/ght.

55:01.380 --> 55:03.541
Good. Good.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.000
Finally.

55:08.130 --> 55:13.716
But, uh, look, I don't want to be involved
in whatever solution you have in mind.

55:13.890 --> 55:16.267
I... I don't do that kind of thing.

55:16.810 --> 55:20.098
Have some of your men do it.

55:20.270 --> 55:21.396
What are you talking about?

55:23.440 --> 55:25.601
What are you planning to do with him?

55:25.940 --> 55:27.601
We ’re putting him somewhere safe.

55:28.530 --> 55:29.736
Somewhere safe?

55:30.070 --> 55:32.618
We can't risk him falling into the hands
of anyone else.

55:32.780 --> 55:36.034
He said he is the sworn enemy of the Hand.

55:36.580 --> 55:38.616
Do you realise how important
that could he?

55:38.790 --> 55:40.075
No, not really.

55:40.540 --> 55:42.838
Well, if it's true,
Danny may be of great value to me.

55:43.000 --> 55:43.955
Dad...

55:44.130 --> 55:46.121
We st/l/ have that house on Long Island;
right on the water.

55:46.300 --> 55:48.916
Let's move him there with a dozen or so
men to keep hIm...

55:49.090 --> 55:50.887
Dad, why?

55:51.390 --> 55:53.255
Why are we protecting him?

55:53.430 --> 55:55.921
Aren't you listening?
Danny may be of great value to me.

55:56.100 --> 55:58.091
This is just crazy, Dad.

55:58.430 --> 56:00.478
Nothing good will come of this.

56:01.230 --> 56:02.185
Ward...

56:03.020 --> 56:04.476

56:10.860 --> 56:11.815
Yes, sir.

56:40.100 --> 56:41.055
It's me.

56:41.560 --> 56:43.516
There's been a change of plans
for the patient.

56:51.030 --> 56:53.100
Hey! You're being moved.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.771
Gotta put this on. Hospital rules.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.241
Where am I going?

57:09.340 --> 57:10.625
He's all yours.

57:57.550 --> 57:59.757
Ward Meachum sends his regards.
