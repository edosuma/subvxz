WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.638
Previously on Empire...
Music streaming
will make Empire

00:04.672 --> 00:05.973
the dominant player
in the music industry.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.176
Swiftstream.
It's ready for a merger.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.211
"Cookie's Cookout."
In Harlem.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.046
That's in Big Heavy's territory.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.147
COOKIE: I'm not doing
business with him,

00:13.181 --> 00:14.482
not after what
he did to my son.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.917
So who you calling
a little bitch now, huh?!

00:16.950 --> 00:20.421
Pull the trigger,
you gonna force me to step
in front of the bullet.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.989
I'm handling it.
You need to be handling

00:22.022 --> 00:23.424
business, not booty.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.592
Fall back.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.360
I would be honored
to submit a song.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.395
Congratulations, Jamal.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.896
HAKEEM:
I'm dropping my last name.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.598
From here on out,
I go by Hakeem.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.599
Think I'm in love,

00:31.632 --> 00:32.566
but we still homies,
right?

00:32.600 --> 00:33.701
I still think you dope.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.568
So what did you
have to tell me?

00:34.602 --> 00:35.503
ANIKA:
Nothing.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.437
Rhonda's pregnant.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.339
I've always wanted
a grandson.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.741
Babies are like kryptonite
for Lucious.
Really?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.510
Where to?

00:42.543 --> 00:45.045
Loretha! Our sister Carol
is on a bender,

00:45.079 --> 00:47.515
saying this was all
Cookie and Jermel's fault.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.317
We gotta go to Philly.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.720
*

00:57.658 --> 00:58.626
Yo!

00:58.659 --> 01:00.060
Loretha!

01:00.094 --> 01:01.195
What?

01:01.229 --> 01:02.963
Slow down, before I
break my damn heel!

01:02.996 --> 01:04.698
Yeah, made in Hong Kong,
I'm sure.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.967
Girl, get to steppin'!
I gotta get back to New York.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.636
Look, I am not
leaving Philadelphia

01:08.669 --> 01:10.638
till I find Carol,
and neither are you!

01:10.671 --> 01:13.241
Look, Candace, we been looking
for Carol for two days.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.442
And...?
We ain't found her.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.644
And I need to get
back to my Cookout,

01:16.677 --> 01:18.112
because I worked
really hard on it

01:18.146 --> 01:19.413
and it's very important to me.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.948
Well, maybe it's time

01:20.981 --> 01:22.883
for other things
to be important to you.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.884
Like Carol.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.886
Shut your dumb ass up.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.290
Why is it every time
Carol gets missing,

01:29.323 --> 01:30.758
the world stops turning?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.626
Because she's
our sister, stupid.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.596
Yeah, well, ain't nobody
send no search party for me

01:35.629 --> 01:37.631
when I was locked up
all them 17 years.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.133
Maybe because
we knew where you were.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.402
Yeah, I can count
on one hand

01:41.435 --> 01:44.238
how many times your
bougie ass came to visit me.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.639
Well, you can keep
on counting, Cookie,

01:45.673 --> 01:47.175
'cause I don't do prisons.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.444
Bitch.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.281
I want this whole city plastered
with these posters!

01:53.314 --> 01:54.782
Or you fired.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.116
I'm dead serious.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.651
That's my mom?

01:57.685 --> 01:58.952
Yo, Ma, where you been at?

01:58.986 --> 02:01.088
I been trying to get at you
all day. Where you at?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.590
Boy, didn't I tell you I was

02:02.623 --> 02:04.325
out of town
handling some business?

02:04.358 --> 02:05.626
Yeah, well, you need
to start taking care

02:05.659 --> 02:07.328
of some business here.
You need to come back here now.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.529
Hakeem, I ain't got
time for this, boy.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.863
What you want?

02:09.897 --> 02:11.765
We gettin' crazy shine
off me winning the battle.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.634
Plus, your Cookout
sold out this morning,

02:13.667 --> 02:15.836
and Rock Steady Park
wants us to add a second show.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.938
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

02:17.971 --> 02:20.007
Okay, you tell Laz
to book the venue right now.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.809
Make sure Laura
and those girls

02:21.842 --> 02:23.711
are rehearsing around the clock.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.878
They gotta build up
their stamina

02:24.912 --> 02:26.146
to open two nights. Okay?

02:26.180 --> 02:28.316
I'm counting on you
to call all the shots

02:28.349 --> 02:29.783
while I'm stuck up here.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.719
Look...

02:31.752 --> 02:34.021
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you, okay?

02:34.054 --> 02:35.623
And I love you so much.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.391
All right, I love you, too, Ma.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.360
Hey! Get your drink
off my mixing board...

02:39.393 --> 02:40.794
You know,
that Lucious

02:40.828 --> 02:43.531
was always a smooth-talkin',
low-down, dirty dog,

02:43.564 --> 02:45.533
but it seems like he did right
with them boys.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.335
Yeah, he did
all right.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.170
Sometimes bad dudes
make decent fathers.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.639
Sometimes.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.140
How is, uh...
Brittany...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.208
Brianna, right?
Yeah, Brianna.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.743
And Franklin.
She's an honor student.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.311
Champion
figure skater.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.746
And my Franklin?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.248
President of
the debate team.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.815
Mmm, well.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.717
Do they know
they half black?
(laughs)

03:03.751 --> 03:05.819
Oh, damn.
What?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.688
Uh, Candace...

03:07.721 --> 03:09.557
remember where Carol
used to hang out

03:09.590 --> 03:10.891
when she first started
gettin' high?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.660
Oh, hell to the no!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.328
We gotta go there.
No, no, no, no.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.830
Loretha,
I don't do prisons,

03:16.864 --> 03:18.699
I'm definitely not
doing a crack house.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.502
Would you stop acting
like Diahann Carroll, heffa?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.170
You ain't been living
in the suburbs

03:23.203 --> 03:25.005
with that white man
all your life.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.341
* Whoo!

03:27.375 --> 03:29.176
* It's the Dynasty

03:29.209 --> 03:30.944
* You perform miracles

03:30.978 --> 03:32.280
* Miracles

03:32.313 --> 03:34.081
* So you want
to rule the world *

03:35.115 --> 03:37.184
* Walk across the ocean

03:37.217 --> 03:38.386
* Miracles

03:38.419 --> 03:40.754
* You can do it if you want it

03:41.822 --> 03:43.791
* 'Cause you perform miracles

03:43.824 --> 03:44.892
* Girl
* My girl... *

03:44.925 --> 03:46.927
* Every moment is miraculous

03:46.960 --> 03:48.429
* With you around is easy

03:48.462 --> 03:50.264
* Never hard like calculus

03:50.298 --> 03:51.432
* My strong black queen

03:51.465 --> 03:53.534
* I feel like
anything is possible *

03:53.567 --> 03:54.968
* We make magic happen

03:55.002 --> 03:56.670
* And overcome every obstacle

03:57.938 --> 03:59.707
* Do you believe in miracles?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.074
* Yeah

04:01.108 --> 04:03.143
* When we're together,
it's miracles *

04:03.176 --> 04:05.112
* You should let me
show you that *

04:05.145 --> 04:06.146
* Show you that *

04:06.179 --> 04:07.948
* No, you should let me
show you that *

04:07.981 --> 04:09.116
* You perform miracles

04:09.149 --> 04:10.451
* Miracles
* Miracles *

04:10.484 --> 04:14.054
(over phone): * So you want
to rule the world *

04:14.087 --> 04:15.889
* Walk across the ocean

04:15.923 --> 04:17.558
* Miracles

04:17.591 --> 04:20.160
* You can do it if you want

04:20.193 --> 04:22.129
* 'Cause you perform
miracles... *

04:31.605 --> 04:33.574
(door creaks open,
rap music plays in distance)

04:33.607 --> 04:35.576
COOKIE: You know Carol?
MAN: Nah.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.345
(people coughing
in distance)

04:37.378 --> 04:39.347
Carol?

04:39.380 --> 04:40.514
Hey. Excuse me.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.649
You know Carol?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.417
Huh? Get outta here, man.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.853
(sighs)
Carol?

04:45.886 --> 04:47.187
Candace...

04:47.220 --> 04:48.456
Carol?

04:48.489 --> 04:50.758
(people murmuring,
grumbling)

04:50.791 --> 04:51.959
Carol?

04:54.227 --> 04:55.663
(moans, gasps)

04:55.696 --> 04:56.864
It's not her.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.098
Oh, thank God.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.200
(sighs)

05:00.233 --> 05:02.570
Where the hell is she?

05:08.742 --> 05:11.044
(fast-tempo intro playing,
photographers clamoring)

05:11.078 --> 05:13.146
* I ain't never gone

05:13.180 --> 05:15.683
* Never gone nowhere

05:15.716 --> 05:18.786
* Quit actin' brand-new,
you know I've been right here *

05:18.819 --> 05:20.320
* Lately I been on...

05:20.354 --> 05:22.222
I was thinking
about the commercial.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.124
The theme of it should
be, like, legacy.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.993
Yeah?
Where'd you come up with that?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.628
This is epic.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.729
I mean, a young prince
paying homage

05:28.762 --> 05:30.230
to his father?
Very Shakespearean.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.465
Dad, I don't know
if that's the way

05:31.499 --> 05:32.666
that Pepsi's going
with it, but we'll see.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.834
It's cool, though.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.669
* Ms. Jackson, oh,
she wear the crown *

05:35.703 --> 05:37.204
* Gotta burn it up.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.008
Thank you guys so much
for being here today.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.011
Today my son, Jamal Lyon,
heads into the studio

05:44.044 --> 05:47.080
to start recording
on his next masterpiece.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.882
It's called
The Black and White Album,

05:48.916 --> 05:50.418
and for the very first track,

05:50.451 --> 05:53.421
we have the incomparable
Skye Summers on it.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.423
We got time for
just a few questions, so...

05:55.456 --> 05:57.591
(reporters clamoring)

05:57.625 --> 05:59.359
Brenda, you go first.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.061
Uh, my question is
for Ms. Summers.
Oh.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.030
Skye, does this mean you'll
be signing with Empire?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.032
Uh...

06:05.065 --> 06:07.501
We are so happy with our label.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.203
But we couldn't be more excited
to be working with Jamal

06:10.237 --> 06:13.073
and the legendary Lucious Lyon.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.341
(audience exclaims)
Now, hold on, hold on.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.543
What's up with this
"legendary" stuff?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.677
You makin' me sound Neolithic
or something.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.845
(laughter)

06:17.878 --> 06:20.347
Trust me, I got a few good
decades left in me.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.183
But for the record,
Empire would be thrilled

06:23.216 --> 06:25.085
to have Skye Summers
on its roster.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.854
And, Jamal, how
excited are you

06:26.887 --> 06:28.589
to be working with
a multi-platinum-selling

06:28.622 --> 06:30.424
artist like
Skye Summers?

06:30.458 --> 06:31.425
Oh, my goodness.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.860
How excited am I?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.227
I'm crazy excited.
Are you kidding me?

06:34.261 --> 06:36.029
Skye, I don't want to
embarrass you too much,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.364
but, y'all, I'm sorry.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.534
I am the O.G.
Skye Summers fan.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.537
And-and her first CD was the
very first CD I ever bought.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.038
You know,
I scratched it up

06:45.072 --> 06:46.206
till it couldn't
play anymore.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.140
And I love her.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.742
I'm in love
with Skye Summers.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.077
Y'all can print that.
(laughter)

06:50.110 --> 06:52.112
(reporters clamoring)

06:52.145 --> 06:53.781
(quietly): I'm not really
feeling this thing.

06:53.814 --> 06:54.782
Let's hit the studio.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.116
You know
I came to play.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.384
I am so down.
Come on, now.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.886
Dad?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.287
Okay, if y'all
want us to produce

07:00.320 --> 07:01.955
diamond, platinum
and gold albums,

07:01.989 --> 07:03.824
you're gonna have
to let us get to work.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.392
Have a good one.
Lucious!

07:05.425 --> 07:07.227
REPORTERS (calling out):
Lucious! Lucious!

07:07.260 --> 07:08.295
* Miracles *

07:08.328 --> 07:09.930
* So you wanna
rule the world *

07:09.963 --> 07:11.732
* Rule the world *

07:11.765 --> 07:13.166
* Walk across the ocean

07:13.200 --> 07:14.334
(in distance):
* Miracles, miracles... *

07:14.367 --> 07:16.136
Yo.
Yo.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.070
What're you doing here?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.339
Chill. Just chill.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.741
You hear that?
Uh-huh.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.109
That's them practicing
their asses off,

07:22.142 --> 07:23.777
'cause they're gonna
do a second show.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.445
It's not time to get paid.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.414
Yo, Laz,
these people are loaded.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.517
Why we just ripping off
the music gigs?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.251
Because that's the play.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.654
Well, I'm starting to think
we should be cutting deeper.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.089
Shake 'em down
from all sides.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.491
Know what, Hev?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.026
The deal's off.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.762
Ain't on you
to call anything off.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.697
I think it is.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.998
Hmm?

07:45.032 --> 07:46.634
You pulling on me?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.636
You think
you're the only one

07:48.669 --> 07:49.937
who came heavy, bro?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.338
Trust me,

07:51.371 --> 07:53.373
you two in the dome
by the time you...
(gun cocks)

07:53.406 --> 07:54.775
By the time what?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.476
Hmm?

07:56.510 --> 08:00.213
I'm disappointed in you.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.150
Here I thought
we was in this for life.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.952
Or death.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.153
That's your call.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.405
(phone chimes, blips)

08:27.274 --> 08:29.677
You know what?
I can't. I can't.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.144
Hit 95 North, please.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.014
For what?
I got to get back
to Lyon Dynasty.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.984
Look, Carol is always
coming up missing, okay?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
She'll turn up sooner or later.
She always does.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.688
No, no, no,
you're not going anywhere.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.855
Head toward Olney Plaza, please.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.392
Uh, I have to go back
to New York.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.527
What happened to Jermel, Cookie?

08:47.561 --> 08:50.564
Why did his head
end up in a box?

08:50.598 --> 08:53.200
You know as much as me.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.735
You're a damn liar.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.103
This is all your fault.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.337
Do you understand that?

08:57.370 --> 08:58.739
Like when we were kids.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.742
Who gave Carol her first drink
and brought her home drunk?

09:01.775 --> 09:04.444
You know what? It is not
my fault she couldn't

09:04.477 --> 09:05.445
hold her liquor.
Oh, no, you...

09:05.478 --> 09:06.446
I don't have to
take this from you!

09:06.479 --> 09:07.414
Oh, yes.
Pull this car over!

09:07.447 --> 09:09.216
No! No, no...!
Pull over! Now!

09:09.249 --> 09:10.751
Pull this damn car over!

09:10.784 --> 09:12.886
Cookie!

09:12.920 --> 09:15.288
Cookie...

09:15.322 --> 09:17.390
Get back in the car!
No! No.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.960
It's all my fault, then
I don't need to be here.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.962
But listen...
Look...

09:21.995 --> 09:24.698
why don't you take my car
and go look for her yourself?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.700
I'll just catch a cab
back to New York.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.968
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.737
Girl, get your hands
off my fur!

09:29.770 --> 09:31.538
Listen!
What?!

09:31.571 --> 09:33.941
If I find Carol dead,

09:33.974 --> 09:36.043
it's on you.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.445
Don't kid yourself, Candace.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.615
It's always on me.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.150
(sighs)

09:49.022 --> 09:50.658
COOKIE:
Hey, Pepper girl. Yeah.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.159
Nah, nah, I'm still in Philly.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.628
Candace? No. (chuckles)

09:54.662 --> 09:56.096
I ditched her tight bougie ass.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.564
I couldn't take it no more.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.833
Yeah, but I can't leave Carol
twisting in the wind,

09:59.867 --> 10:01.735
so I'm gonna need your help
finding her.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.504
Yeah, I'm gonna come to you
right now. Is that cool?

10:04.537 --> 10:07.274
Where are you nowadays?

10:07.307 --> 10:10.143
Damn, bitch, all the way out
in the suburbs?!

10:10.177 --> 10:11.645
Nah, it's cool. It's cool.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.180
I'll see you in a minute.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.748
So? What do you think?

10:14.782 --> 10:15.949
RHONDA:
Oh!

10:15.983 --> 10:19.086
Lucious, this is...
stunning.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.754
I mean, I can't
get over it.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.255
No. Six bedrooms.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.591
More than enough
room for a nursery.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.959
And get this.
What?

10:25.993 --> 10:28.028
You could have
the nanny's quarters below.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.197
(gasps)
Amazing! Amazing.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.598
I don't know
what to say.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.500
We, uh, can't thank
you enough for this.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.202
Yeah.
No, no, no.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.537
The thank you is
to you two.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.974
Because of y'all, the Lyon
legacy is gonna live on.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.044
I mean, when Hakeem decided
he was gonna drop his last name,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.146
I realized then that
I got to start looking

10:46.179 --> 10:47.480
to the next generation.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.816
Mm-hmm.

10:48.849 --> 10:52.052
(laughs)
(gibbering happily)

10:52.085 --> 10:53.553
(laughs)
This is the future!

10:53.586 --> 10:55.188
Oh!

10:55.222 --> 10:58.058
Oh.
Please take a look at
the rest of your house.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.228
I am gonna go decide where
the nursery's gonna go.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.799
RHONDA:
Wow!

11:05.833 --> 11:07.500
Your faith.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.004
Can't believe it, but it's
made you a stronger man.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.406
It made you a man of conviction.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.376
My grandson is
so fortunate and blessed

11:16.409 --> 11:18.678
to have you as his father.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.714
I'm through testing you, Dre.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.682
You mean it?

11:22.716 --> 11:25.819
From my core.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.088
Thank you, Pop.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.689
And what you said,

11:29.723 --> 11:32.192
it means more to me
than all of this.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.061
(laughing)

11:34.094 --> 11:36.329
I'm so proud of you, man.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.665
But you gotta admit,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.500
it's a pretty damn
nice gift, ain't it?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.335
(both laugh)

11:42.369 --> 11:44.271
You know what?
I think we need to move

11:44.304 --> 11:45.739
a lot faster
on this Swiftstream deal.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.941
I want us to be
the dominant force

11:47.975 --> 11:52.045
in music streaming long before
my grandson is potty-trained.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.047
I've been working on that, and
I think I've found a solution.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.382
You ever hear of Bowie Bonds?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.717
Yeah, something about
Bowie wanting to buy his, um,

11:57.751 --> 11:59.953
music catalog back
from an ex-manager

11:59.987 --> 12:01.922
he had a falling out with.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.891
Right, and as a result,
he came up with a concept

12:03.924 --> 12:06.293
of forfeiting future royalties
for cash on hand.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.395
Are you saying we can
raise the money we need

12:08.428 --> 12:10.697
by using my old music
as collateral?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.299
Bingo.
That's genius.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.400
Let's do it.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.534
There's a catch.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.136
Mom still owns
half the publishing rights

12:16.169 --> 12:18.071
over some of those early songs.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.774
The ones that are
most valuable.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.475
Damn.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.445
Hey, hold off on the new posters
until I confirm night two.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.280
Had a few hiccups
with the venue.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.648
I just want to make sure
that's squared away.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.150
Let's get the copy ready
for when I'm back.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.052
Laz, let me holla at you.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.486
Yeah, okay, Hakeem.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.956
Uh, I want to go over the press
calendar next when I get back.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.557
Have that ready.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.927
Close the door.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.831
There a problem?
You tell me.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.166
I heard Big Heavy and his boys
came and paid us a visit?

12:46.199 --> 12:48.168
I can't have them boys
coming around here,

12:48.201 --> 12:49.502
making my girls nervous.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.838
I feel you, all right?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.172
But I took care of it.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.573
They're not gonna
come back again.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.008
Good.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.844
Look, man, I know
I've been hard on you.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.511
My label is my life.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.680
My mom, she
deserves the best.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.182
She does.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.483
As do you.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.651
And that's real talk.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.186
Thank you, but I don't
need no props.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.421
We should have announced
my second concert by now.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.090
We got a lot of
tickets to sell.

13:10.123 --> 13:10.958
Why you stalling?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.125
Look, I'm not stalling.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.994
You just need to trust me.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.262
All right?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.263
All right.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.431
But this is my time.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.934
So I trust
you'll make it happen.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.769
I will.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.371
That's a bet.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.973
Don't let me down.

13:34.681 --> 13:35.782
COOKIE:
What, Lucious?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.050
Hey, Cookie.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.485
Look, I need to talk to you
about something.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.619
It's real important.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.821
I am walking all alone,
by myself,

13:41.855 --> 13:43.390
in a very dangerous
neighborhood,

13:43.423 --> 13:44.691
so just get to the point.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.193
What, you need me
to come and get you?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.228
No, I just need you
to tell me what you want.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.563
Now, look here, I'm about
to purchase this company

13:50.597 --> 13:53.200
called Swiftstream-- it's
a music streaming service to...

13:53.233 --> 13:54.234
WOMAN:
Cookie?

13:54.267 --> 13:55.735
Okay, Lucious, you gonna have to

13:55.768 --> 13:57.337
talk to me about it later. Okay.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.738
Wait, wait, wait, wait...!

13:58.771 --> 14:01.208
Damn, Pepper, it took you
long enough to hit me back!

14:01.241 --> 14:02.809
Girl, you still rocking a pager?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.411
Someone has to make
the muffins, honey.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.179
Baker's hours are no joke.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.414
Come here!
Aw...

14:07.447 --> 14:09.516
Oh, my goodness!
Aw, so good!

14:09.549 --> 14:11.018
(cash register rings)

14:11.051 --> 14:14.254
Damn, Cookie, you look
like a million bucks.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.388
Just a million, huh?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.090
I must be slipping.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.525
Nah, you're keeping
it firm, honey.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.927
I remember you,

14:19.960 --> 14:22.762
making us all do laps
around the yard, right?

14:22.795 --> 14:24.264
Correctional cardio, baby.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.366
You in the yard,
keeping them all skinny.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.268
And you in the kitchen,
keeping them thick.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.003
BOTH:
Baddest bitches on the block.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.838
(both laugh)

14:31.871 --> 14:34.541
Hi. Uh, why don't
we go in the kitchen?

14:34.574 --> 14:35.608
How you doing?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.710
PEPPER: Wait till
you see what I got.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.612
Oh, here it is,
mommy, right there.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.181
All right, now,
Miss Betty Crocker.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.615
I knew you could burn
in the kitchen,

14:42.649 --> 14:44.184
but what else you got
cooking in these back rooms?

14:44.217 --> 14:47.287
I have no idea
what you're insinuating.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.457
Just a bunch of
little bakers... baking.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.959
So I asked around
about your sister.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.060
Mmm.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.261
She's hanging out with Boz.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.762
Has been for a couple months.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.730
That little skinny bitch
that likes to beat women.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.032
That would be him.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.600
Yeah, I got it from here.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.203
Listen, ain't no way Boz's
crew's gonna talk to you.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.105
Not like the way
they talk to me.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.140
I'm coming with you.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.241
LUCIOUS:
Thank you.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.776
Another martini?

15:09.809 --> 15:11.878
Skye's excited
to be working with Jamal.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.147
She admires the way
he uses his music

15:14.181 --> 15:16.816
to express what's on his mind
and in his heart.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.219
Um, son, why don't you play her
what we've been working on?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.488
Absolutely.

15:29.496 --> 15:33.833
* 'Cause you're
so supernatural *

15:33.866 --> 15:37.670
* So unpredictable

15:37.704 --> 15:43.176
* And, baby,
I just gotta know *

15:43.210 --> 15:46.113
* Where did you come from?

15:46.146 --> 15:49.016
* And I won't be blind...

15:49.049 --> 15:51.851
What's wrong?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.520
Um, I...

15:53.553 --> 15:56.423
when I asked to work
with Lucious Lyon,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.191
I guess I just expected...

15:58.225 --> 16:00.793
We were hoping
for something edgier.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.130
Judith, you know this
business is like the Autobahn.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.032
I mean, if you don't
stay in your lane,

16:05.065 --> 16:06.466
you gonna crash and burn.

16:06.499 --> 16:09.602
And, Skye, your lane has
always been girl-power pop.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.938
And you're brilliant
in that lane.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.706
That's why you got
five ASAs

16:13.740 --> 16:14.941
on your mantle.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.010
Um... Dad...

16:17.044 --> 16:19.046
you want to show Judith
your new Mickalene Thomas?

16:19.079 --> 16:21.514
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, I love her work.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.051
Come on.
Please.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.653
Got a new one, I just
got about two weeks ago.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.887
JUDITH:
Oh.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.156
(chuckles)

16:29.189 --> 16:30.890
What's up?

16:30.923 --> 16:32.325
Talk to me.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.127
It's a nice song, Jamal.

16:34.161 --> 16:38.065
It's just, that's not
where I want to go next.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.333
Yeah, I remember when you
recorded "Look Around,"

16:40.367 --> 16:42.569
and your label wouldn't
let you release it.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.405
That was, like,
some stupid demo I did,

16:45.438 --> 16:46.873
so why do you know that?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.308
I told you I was
your superfan.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.742
I wasn't joking about that.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.744
No, obviously no.
Come on, now.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.246
You're serious?
Yes, very.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.547
And by the way,
it was not stupid.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.582
It was actually really hot.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.750
I loved it.
Thank you.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.918
Why don't you just,
I don't know...

16:58.951 --> 17:00.253
tell me what's
in your head?

17:00.287 --> 17:01.721
Maybe we could write
something new together.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.957
I would love that.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.932
I cannot get over

17:12.965 --> 17:14.167
how good you're doing, Cookie.
(Cookie laughs)

17:14.201 --> 17:15.402
Who would've thought
two cellies like us

17:15.435 --> 17:17.104
flipping it around
on the outside?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.605
You two were in prison together?

17:18.638 --> 17:19.939
Oh, yeah.
I did a dime

17:19.972 --> 17:21.274
of my 17 with this
woman right here,

17:21.308 --> 17:22.509
and I ain't ashamed.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.943
Your sister got me through

17:23.976 --> 17:25.678
a whole lot of hell
up in there.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.280
You know,
I owe you, Cookie.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.381
Nah.
I do.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.616
All them times
you covered for me

17:29.649 --> 17:30.683
with Lady Athena?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.452
That was the warden.
Yeah, that bitch.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.886
I didn't think it was
Greek literature.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.023
You know, those girls
miss you, Cook.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.891
Every time they write me,
they ask about you.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.194
You know Jezzy?
Ah!

17:41.228 --> 17:42.729
Oh, she misses you
like a limb, Cookie.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.131
Yeah, I don't miss
that hell house,

17:44.164 --> 17:46.133
but I sure miss those girls,
my girls, those women.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.868
Yeah.
Yeah, they were like
true sisters to me.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.069
Mm.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.805
You know what would mean
the world to them, Cookie?

17:52.839 --> 17:54.974
Family Day's next week.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.709
Why don't you show up,
do a little show at Wallace?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.711
Oh, I can't.
I can't, I'm sorry.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.713
I'm-I'm throwing
this cookout in the city.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.215
You should come. It's...

18:02.249 --> 18:04.050
Carol!

18:04.083 --> 18:05.218
Carol!

18:05.252 --> 18:06.586
Oh, my God!

18:06.619 --> 18:08.388
Get your hand from
around my sister!

18:08.421 --> 18:10.157
That's right, before I break it!
Go, go!

18:10.190 --> 18:11.424
Uh-uh-uh...
Carol... No, no, no!

18:11.458 --> 18:12.659
Uh-uh-uh, no! No!
No, no, no, no!

18:12.692 --> 18:14.827
Carol, Carol, look,
we have been looking

18:14.861 --> 18:17.497
for you all over this city
for two days now.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.931
It ain't been
no two days.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.300
BOTH:
Yes, it has!

18:20.333 --> 18:21.668
And look at you,
you look a mess!

18:21.701 --> 18:23.002
What have you been using?

18:23.035 --> 18:23.836
Come on, get in the car.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.838
What...? Wait!
What?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.940
Just wait.
What?!

18:27.974 --> 18:30.177
(Carol retching, all groaning)

18:30.210 --> 18:32.212
PEPPER:
That's nasty.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.849
(groaning)

18:36.883 --> 18:38.251
Would you come on,
nasty?

18:38.285 --> 18:41.188
Look, I ain't going
nowhere with you, Cookie.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.523
Unless it's to go
get something to eat.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.359
If you don't get your stinking
ass in this car now...

18:46.393 --> 18:48.195
PEPPER:
After you.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.797
She vomited on me.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.199
Yeah, I saw that.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.101
* Yeah, yeah, yeah

18:55.134 --> 18:56.203
* Yeah.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.838
(indistinct chatter)

18:58.871 --> 19:00.607
Thank you, Betty.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.974
Oh, oh, no, that's okay.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.276
I don't need you
to pay for me.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.245
I wasn't planning
on paying for you.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.014
Let's talk.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.016
Carol, your kids are
safe with me and Danny

19:10.049 --> 19:12.185
in Blue Bell, but they are
worried sick about you.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.887
Girl, you need a break
from Philly.

19:14.921 --> 19:15.988
You can come with me.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.057
All right?
Clear your head.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.292
There's good schools out there.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.460
Your kids, they will love it.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.529
Nah, she's coming with me.
What?

19:22.562 --> 19:24.631
So she can end up
like this again?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.798
Candace, please
don't start it

19:25.832 --> 19:28.635
with your bougie,
coupon-shopping-ass.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.403
Loretha, stop.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.738
I'm sick of you
trying to...

19:31.771 --> 19:33.306
I'm sick of you calling me
by my government name.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.007
Um, may I please excuse
the both of y'all?

19:35.041 --> 19:37.043
Damn, I-I can make
own decisions.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.145
Thank you.
Yeah, well, you doing
a bang-up job.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.179
Fine.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.214
Shut up.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.049
Which one you gonna choose?

19:43.082 --> 19:43.916
What?!

19:43.950 --> 19:47.153
Me... or Cookie?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.922
(both laughing)

19:52.091 --> 19:55.528
What's gonna happen to my kids
if I go to New York?

19:58.798 --> 20:01.000
I'll keep them.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.436
Until you get yourself together.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.905
Then I'm going with Cookie.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.173
Well, I guess Cookie

20:07.206 --> 20:10.176
ain't all that bad
if she coming with me.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.345
You know what, Candace?

20:12.379 --> 20:14.347
Why don't you just keep
sipping on that Haterade

20:14.381 --> 20:16.516
while I go to
the bathroom?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.451
Mm!

20:18.485 --> 20:19.919
You two deserve each other

20:19.952 --> 20:22.188
for the rest
of your miserable lives.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.090
You ain't ever happy.

20:24.123 --> 20:28.461
If only she knew what you did
while she was away in prison.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.798
Wouldn't be such
a Sister Sledge reunion,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.600
now, would it?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.134
Hmm.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.306
A'ight, I'm here.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.207
What you want?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.843
What, I can't congratulate
my son on a job well done?

20:45.345 --> 20:49.148
It was very clever what you did
at the freestyle battle.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.051
I don't know if
you know this yet, but, um,

20:52.084 --> 20:54.454
I'm about to acquire
Swiftstream,

20:54.487 --> 20:56.323
a music streaming service.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.658
Yeah, I know.
I heard it out on the streets.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.627
It's gonna be worth a fortune.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.995
Now, initially I intended
to leave it to you

21:03.029 --> 21:06.165
and your brothers' names,
but are you sure

21:06.198 --> 21:08.435
you want to drop
the last name Lyon?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.002
What do you care
what name I use?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.438
You didn't want me
to be your son.

21:13.039 --> 21:16.809
Hakeem, you put on quite a show
disowning my last name.

21:16.843 --> 21:20.447
But yet, you out in the street
trading on it,

21:20.480 --> 21:22.782
making a living off of it.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.284
Lyon Dynasty, my black ass.

21:25.318 --> 21:29.188
Now, I'm gonna give you
one last chance

21:29.221 --> 21:31.257
to sign with Empire.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.693
I'm-a allow you to post a video

21:33.726 --> 21:35.762
saying you keeping
the last name Lyon,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.331
and I'll make you a full partner
with your brothers

21:38.365 --> 21:40.767
in Swiftstream.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.370
How I know you gonna
keep your promise?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.304
I've always rewarded loyalty.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.006
Talk to Andre.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.809
I just bought him and Rhonda
a six-bedroom mansion

21:49.842 --> 21:51.878
out in Long Island.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.946
Two and a half acres.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.648
What do you want?

22:01.020 --> 22:03.189
This son can't be bought.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.202
* Powerful

22:16.235 --> 22:19.872
* A breath away from victory

22:19.906 --> 22:21.541
* I matter

22:21.574 --> 22:23.843
* You matter

22:27.213 --> 22:28.848
* I matter

22:28.881 --> 22:31.618
* You matter

22:35.688 --> 22:40.026
* I see a colorful future

22:40.059 --> 22:42.929
(humming)

22:42.962 --> 22:46.533
* And stars are
the only thing shooting *

22:46.566 --> 22:49.101
* Shooting

22:49.135 --> 22:50.703
* Mm-hmm...
What is that?

22:50.737 --> 22:54.040
So dope.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.308
It's something
I'll never get to sing.

22:58.310 --> 23:01.080
'Cause you know I sing
sorority girl breakup songs,

23:01.113 --> 23:04.183
and, like your father said,
I need to stay in my lane.

23:04.216 --> 23:08.120
Well, I think
that sounds like some...

23:08.154 --> 23:11.390
some wack-ass executive talk.

23:11.424 --> 23:14.961
This right here though,
it's deep.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.295
Beautiful.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.930
Feels like you, Skye.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.100
I envy you, man.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.602
Why you envy me, woman?

23:22.635 --> 23:24.203
(chuckles softly)

23:24.236 --> 23:25.772
'Cause, you know, you...

23:25.805 --> 23:27.874
(sighs) you're in charge
of your identity.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.376
You know, you got to define
who you are,

23:30.409 --> 23:31.744
and people love you for it,

23:31.778 --> 23:33.713
and, man,

23:33.746 --> 23:36.616
if I sang my whole truth,
my fans would turn on me.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.217
I guarantee you they wouldn't.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.453
Yeah, because they just
want you in a box.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.221
You know, they want you
to be in, like,

23:42.254 --> 23:43.289
you know, you're black
or you're white,

23:43.322 --> 23:44.423
or you're pop or you're soul.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.892
You know,
just fit in that little...

23:45.925 --> 23:47.494
Yeah, but throw that box away.
Burn that box.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.295
You know what I'm saying?
You don't need it.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.397
You know why I really want
to work with you?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.966
'Cause, um, you're my super fan.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.469
I mean, obviously,
I'm the O.G. super fan.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.905
(laughs)
I mean, obviously.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.007
It's more than that. It's...

24:01.040 --> 24:03.309
It's 'cause you're so much more.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.244
You know, like,
you got all this amazingness

24:05.277 --> 24:07.814
that you think that you got
to keep hidden. You don't.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.817
I really want to help you
bust out of that.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.418
Bust out of it, girl.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.453
Play the song again, please?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.829
* Powerful

24:22.862 --> 24:26.332
* So much strength
in you and me *

24:26.365 --> 24:29.702
* Powerful

24:29.736 --> 24:33.172
* A breath away from victory

24:33.205 --> 24:35.174
* I matter

24:35.207 --> 24:37.376
* You matter

24:37.409 --> 24:41.113
* We matter, oh

24:41.147 --> 24:43.315
* I matter

24:43.349 --> 24:45.284
* You matter

24:45.317 --> 24:48.655
BOTH:
* We matter, oh.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.424
I like that.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.496
Oh, my God.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.499
I know.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.001
This is just...

25:02.034 --> 25:03.302
Yeah.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.571
(sighs)

25:04.604 --> 25:07.173
I mean, I don't really know

25:07.206 --> 25:10.543
what we're gonna do with
all the extra space, but...

25:10.577 --> 25:12.344
I guess I'll just
have to fill it up

25:12.378 --> 25:13.479
with a bunch of Lyon babies.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.447
(laughs)
(coughing)

25:16.448 --> 25:18.517
Are-are you okay?

25:18.551 --> 25:19.852
Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.387
I just, um...

25:21.420 --> 25:22.421
What? What's wrong?

25:22.454 --> 25:23.389
(sighs)

25:23.422 --> 25:25.357
I, uh,

25:25.391 --> 25:28.060
think I'm in love,

25:28.094 --> 25:29.528
and I'm ashamed.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.497
Ashamed? Why-why...

25:31.530 --> 25:33.666
Oh, you're not still in love
with Lucious, are you?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.868
Oh, no, no, no. (scoffs)
God, no.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.570
(chuckles)
That ship has
sailed and sunk.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.071
No, it's, um,

25:39.105 --> 25:40.740
someone you don't know.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.508
It's another musician.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.210
Um, we were involved

25:44.243 --> 25:47.546
for some time,
and it got really complicated.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.181
Mm-hmm.
And then I was fine,

25:49.215 --> 25:51.517
Mm-hmm.
and then I heard a song
that he wrote the other day,

25:51.550 --> 25:53.620
and then everything
just kind of...

25:53.653 --> 25:55.487
came back.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.859
Did I ever tell you
the ponytail story?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.060
Uh-uh.

26:01.093 --> 26:01.894
Alyssa Shepard?

26:01.928 --> 26:03.062
No. Who's that?

26:03.095 --> 26:05.031
Oh, she was just this cow

26:05.064 --> 26:07.366
that tried to take Andre
away from me in college.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.768
(chuckles)

26:08.801 --> 26:11.971
So one night, I, um,
snuck into her dorm room,

26:12.004 --> 26:15.207
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.777
And I texted her a picture
of it the next day,

26:17.810 --> 26:19.545
and I said,
"I will continue cutting

26:19.578 --> 26:21.547
if you do not
leave Andre alone."

26:21.580 --> 26:22.581
So what-what happened?

26:22.615 --> 26:23.716
I mean, did she... did it work?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.217
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

26:25.251 --> 26:27.219
I'm just saying that
if you find somebody

26:27.253 --> 26:29.588
that's worth fighting for,
then that's what you have to do,

26:29.622 --> 26:31.991
and take down anyone
that gets in your way.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.693
You know?

26:44.336 --> 26:47.073
(sighs)

26:47.106 --> 26:49.108
(groaning)

26:51.711 --> 26:53.746
(sighs)

26:53.780 --> 26:55.514
Mmm.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.150
Ooh, that feels so good.

26:58.184 --> 27:01.287
Baby, listen, tonight I got
to deal with my sister, okay?

27:01.320 --> 27:04.090
But tomorrow, I am all yours.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.758
LUCIOUS:
You promise?

27:05.792 --> 27:06.993
(gasps)

27:07.026 --> 27:08.160
Lucious, what the hell

27:08.194 --> 27:09.261
are you doing here?

27:09.295 --> 27:10.596
Taking you up on your offer.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.598
No. What do you want?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.867
Look, I need you to...

27:14.901 --> 27:17.636
sign over your rights
to my early songs.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.672
I've got an opportunity
to raise the capital

27:19.706 --> 27:21.808
necessary to buy
Swiftstream.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.876
You want me to sign over
my rights

27:23.910 --> 27:27.013
to your songs that I produced,
that we produced?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.614
Are you stupid?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.616
No, baby, this is a big deal
for Empire,

27:30.649 --> 27:34.120
and you and the boys
are still shareholders,

27:34.153 --> 27:35.788
so it's a win-win for everybody.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.390
You know, before we had
two nickels to rub together,

27:38.424 --> 27:39.959
all we had was the music,

27:39.992 --> 27:42.394
and if give that up,
we're bankrupt.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.163
Why did we do
all of this, Lucious?

27:44.196 --> 27:45.564
For stocks and bonds?

27:45.597 --> 27:46.899
No, you are missing
the bigger picture.

27:46.933 --> 27:47.900
No.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.468
I see the bigger picture,
Lucious.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.705
In fact, I'm the only one
of us that does.

27:52.739 --> 27:55.641
That's why I'm telling
your stupid ass no.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.177
You want your Swifty-streamy,
you're gonna have to

27:58.210 --> 28:00.346
get it some other kind of way.
Hey, boo.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.648
I'm sorry it took so long;
there were no clean glasses.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.016
Oh.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.484
I didn't realize
we had company.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.853
I didn't, either.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.321
Laz Delgado.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.557
Lucious Lyon.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.792
And he was just leaving.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.868
It's nice to see you
sleeping your way to the bottom.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.809
Good thing you got your maid
in here to clean it up.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.318
*

28:41.420 --> 28:43.422
HAKEEM:
* You want my spot, flash?
* But you can't buy it *

28:43.455 --> 28:46.392
* It's Hakeem put a bullet
to the name Lyon *

28:46.425 --> 28:47.726
* Who run it?
* Hakeem *

28:47.760 --> 28:49.528
* Who run it?
* Hakeem... *

28:49.561 --> 28:52.298
Yo, babe, I should definitely
add this song to the Cookout.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.200
Now, what you think?
Yeah, you know the crowd

28:54.233 --> 28:56.068
will want to hear it.
Yeah?

28:56.102 --> 28:57.569
And I can't
get enough of it.

28:57.603 --> 28:58.905
And I can't get enough of you.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.572
* Put a bullet
to the name Lyon... *

29:00.606 --> 29:02.608
*

29:02.641 --> 29:03.642
(chuckles)

29:05.311 --> 29:06.779
Hakeem.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.314
Anika here, man.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.582
Anika, what you doing here?

29:10.616 --> 29:12.584
I'm just here to
join the party.

29:12.618 --> 29:15.121
I assume my invitation
got lost in the mail.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.090
Do I know you from somewhere?

29:18.124 --> 29:20.827
No, I doubt it, honey, unless
you bus tables at Nobu.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.930
HAKEEM:
Chill out, Anika.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.165
You know, I saw your rehearsal
online, Hakeem.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.667
Um... wasn't that the song
that you wrote for Camilla?

29:28.700 --> 29:30.602
Who?

29:30.636 --> 29:32.771
It's time for you
to leave, Anika.

29:32.805 --> 29:35.107
You know, it was
a great song.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.343
But now it's
missing something.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.812
I don't know,
I feel like...

29:39.846 --> 29:41.513
it needs
a real singer.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.483
A woman, not some
Nuyorican wannabe

29:44.516 --> 29:45.751
from the South Bronx.
Excuse me?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.453
Hakeem, what is
she talking about?

29:47.486 --> 29:50.189
Your Jenny from the Block
jump-off lives in a hovel

29:50.222 --> 29:52.791
with seven brothers and sisters.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.994
(sighs)

29:55.027 --> 29:57.096
You could do
so much better, baby.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.199
What are you doing?
Anika!

30:02.501 --> 30:04.636
(Lucious playing
lively melody on guitar)

30:04.670 --> 30:05.771
Hey, Pop.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.006
You got a minute?

30:07.039 --> 30:09.008
No, I'm working
something out, Dre.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.877
Bowie Bonds idea's
not gonna work.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.180
Why in the hell not?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.815
Dre, I asked you
to find me another option

30:16.849 --> 30:18.784
beyond your mama's signature.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.486
I know that, I understand that,
and I tried.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.288
There's no way to move forward
with Mom holding on

30:22.321 --> 30:23.622
to her share
of the music rights.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.958
Wha... So that's what
they taught you at Wharton?

30:25.992 --> 30:27.293
You-you try something,

30:27.326 --> 30:29.461
but if you hit a brick wall,
you just stop.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.031
Wharton taught me
to find solutions, Pop.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.134
And I found you one.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.169
Leverage Empire's other assets.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.072
If we sell off
the fashion

30:40.106 --> 30:42.208
or-or the sports merchandising
or the alcohol divisions,

30:42.241 --> 30:45.011
Pop, we can do this.
Just got to have faith.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.046
Oh, no, no, no,
that's not acceptable.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.248
Look, son, the moment
you start selling off

30:49.281 --> 30:52.751
pieces of Empire,
we're no longer an empire.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.720
I'd rather die than do that.

30:55.922 --> 30:58.490
Yes, sir.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.892
I'll find a way.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.762
(bell rings)

31:03.795 --> 31:05.397
Crazy in here today.
So what's happening?

31:05.431 --> 31:07.399
Jamal's rehearsing for his
video shoot and then...

31:07.433 --> 31:09.368
Yeah, and the director
is trying to get some

31:09.401 --> 31:11.203
behind-the-scenes footage
of the rehearsal.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.505
But this whole commercial--
this is just

31:13.539 --> 31:16.208
a part of the plan
that I have for Jamal.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.244
You're the other part of it.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.914
I don't think I can
stay in my lane, Lucious.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.015
What do you mean?

31:23.049 --> 31:24.383
When you first started,

31:24.416 --> 31:25.584
you blazed a new trail.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.186
You were out of the box.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.089
And that's what Jamal
is doing, and...

31:30.122 --> 31:33.725
that's why I want to work
with both of you.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.428
Are you thinking
about a new lane?

31:36.462 --> 31:39.031
(both chuckling)

31:39.065 --> 31:40.532
How we doing, Lee?

31:40.566 --> 31:42.935
Excited, excited!

31:42.969 --> 31:45.037
Let's get this
Pepsi thing on the road.
Good.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.905
Oh, by the way,

31:46.939 --> 31:49.441
did you talk to Jamal
about, um,

31:49.475 --> 31:51.443
my concept
regarding...
LEE: I did.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.878
LUCIOUS: ...father and son
ideas, because...
LEE: I did.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.948
I did. I did.
And?

31:55.982 --> 31:57.483
Uh, I'm gonna
do something different.

31:57.516 --> 31:58.650
Different how?

31:58.684 --> 32:01.487
Lucious, you represent the past.
This kid,

32:01.520 --> 32:03.289
he's the future-- that's
the reason why I signed up

32:03.322 --> 32:04.323
for this thing, so we're gonna

32:04.356 --> 32:05.457
do something
completely different,

32:05.491 --> 32:06.892
you know...
Look, um, why don't we

32:06.925 --> 32:08.494
go by my trailer
and-and talk about it?

32:08.527 --> 32:10.229
We'll go by craft service...
Oh, no. No, no!

32:10.262 --> 32:11.630
...then we'll talk.
No, no. No, no.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.565
Jamal. Have you...
JAMAL: Yes?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.067
Tom! Where's Tom?

32:15.101 --> 32:16.802
* Put your hands up
once we turn up the bass *

32:16.835 --> 32:18.637
* Hey *

32:18.670 --> 32:20.472
* Hey *

32:20.506 --> 32:22.241
* Hey *

32:22.274 --> 32:23.642
* Hey *

32:25.344 --> 32:26.345
* Hey *

32:26.378 --> 32:27.679
* Ho! *

32:28.780 --> 32:30.449
* Hey *

32:30.482 --> 32:32.318
* I get up with my mind

32:32.351 --> 32:34.086
* Stay on the grind

32:34.120 --> 32:35.587
* Everything will be mine

32:35.621 --> 32:37.123
* Including you

32:37.156 --> 32:38.690
* Mm, got my eyes
on the prize *

32:38.724 --> 32:41.427
* Gonna make you realize

32:41.460 --> 32:42.961
* My goal is the sky

32:42.995 --> 32:44.330
* It's what I'll do

32:44.363 --> 32:45.864
* Oh...
* Hey *

32:45.897 --> 32:47.933
* I said that I would show

32:47.966 --> 32:52.171
* Everybody what
they should already know *

32:52.204 --> 32:55.541
* I grew up, stood up,
and now I'm ready to go *

32:55.574 --> 32:57.676
* Whoo! *

32:57.709 --> 32:59.611
* Ready, set, go
* Ho! *

32:59.645 --> 33:01.347
* I'm ready to go

33:01.380 --> 33:02.381
* Ready, set, go
* Hey! *

33:02.414 --> 33:04.016
* I'm ready to go, go, go...

33:04.050 --> 33:06.852
LEE: Yes, God!
It's all about Jamal.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.355
* I'm ready to go, go, go

33:09.388 --> 33:11.357
* Put your hands up
once we turn up the bass *

33:11.390 --> 33:14.026
* Hey! *

33:14.060 --> 33:15.061
* Hey! *

33:15.094 --> 33:16.862
* Hey! *

33:18.030 --> 33:19.998
* Hey! *

33:20.032 --> 33:21.200
* Hey! *

33:21.233 --> 33:22.234
* Oh! *

33:22.268 --> 33:24.002
* Hey! *

33:24.036 --> 33:25.737
* Said I can't deny...

33:25.771 --> 33:27.339
Do it.
Do what?

33:27.373 --> 33:29.375
Sell everything,
leverage whatever we have to.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.542
Just get me Swiftstream.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.578
Look, if Swiftstream lives up
to the projections,

33:32.611 --> 33:35.214
we'll be able to buy all those
divisions back, and then some.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.183
And the way I see it,
I took Empire public

33:37.216 --> 33:39.718
so that I could lead the
music industry into the future.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.153
That's what we're gonna do.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.421
Sometimes in order
to win the game,

33:42.454 --> 33:43.889
you got to be willing
to sacrifice.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.491
* Everybody what
they should already know... *

33:45.524 --> 33:46.925
Lee Daniels think
he's seen the future?

33:46.958 --> 33:48.927
I'm-a show him.
* I grew up, stood up

33:48.960 --> 33:52.931
* Now I'm...
I'm ready to go, go, go *

33:52.964 --> 33:55.767
* Put your hands up
once we turn up the bass *

33:55.801 --> 33:58.070
* Hey! *

33:58.104 --> 33:59.505
* Hey! *

33:59.538 --> 34:00.572
* Hey! *

34:00.606 --> 34:01.773
* Hey! *

34:07.079 --> 34:09.948
Ma, your light bill is $2,300.
Lighting is everything, boy.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.583
What's up, Hakeem?
If I would have known

34:11.617 --> 34:13.452
you're gonna be here,
I'd have brought you one, too.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.553
Did I ask?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.957
Is, um, everything okay?

34:18.990 --> 34:20.526
What is this about you wanting

34:20.559 --> 34:22.428
to the change venue
for the Cookout?

34:22.461 --> 34:23.962
I found a better place.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.797
Okay? It's in the Bronx,
it's bigger.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.199
No!
It's way better.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.934
I'm not going
to the Bronx.

34:28.967 --> 34:30.936
Look, Cookie, just hear me out
on this before you say no.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.438
I already said it.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.241
Yeah, see, 'cause I already
sold out Rock Steady Park.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.808
And I already spent a grip

34:36.842 --> 34:38.644
on marketing and merchandising.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.078
I'm not moving it.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.080
And Big Heavy better not
try to come back at us.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.216
Yeah, better not be,
his bitch ass.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.651
So, why was he here, man?

34:47.686 --> 34:51.056
Look, Cookie,
you got to listen to me, okay?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.991
Just trust me.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.060
I want to trust you,
but you making it kind of hard.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.061
LUCIOUS:
Forgive me

34:56.094 --> 34:57.296
for being so rude, but

34:57.329 --> 34:58.297
I just...

34:58.330 --> 34:59.631
Something about pretty boy.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.301
I just couldn't
get you off my mind.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.935
So I looked you up, Delgado.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.937
You one of them Bully boys,
ain't you?

35:05.971 --> 35:07.306
COOKIE:
Lucious, what are you

35:07.339 --> 35:08.407
talking about?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.941
LUCIOUS:
125th Street Bulls.

35:09.975 --> 35:11.677
They run a little

35:11.710 --> 35:15.080
petty scam of
extorting young rappers and

35:15.113 --> 35:16.648
making they mamas
pay for it.

35:16.682 --> 35:17.849
HAKEEM:
Mom, them dudes

35:17.883 --> 35:19.851
that snatched me had a bull
on they back.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.187
Does he have one?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.095
Like this?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.497
I got this, boy.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.166
Ooh.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.305
Cookie, listen to me.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.174
Look, when this started,
this was just a gig.

35:42.208 --> 35:46.011
I had no idea I was gonna
fall in love with you.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.045
Mm-mm.

35:47.078 --> 35:50.282
It was real.

35:50.316 --> 35:53.118
I just need more time.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.153
I was trying to fix this.

35:56.188 --> 35:59.057
Hakeem...

35:59.090 --> 36:01.092
let's go.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.917
(sighs)

36:33.124 --> 36:36.094
(distant siren wailing)

36:37.195 --> 36:39.097
Hi. I'm happy you called.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.532
I take it you're not

36:40.566 --> 36:42.368
too mad about last night?
Listen, Anika,

36:42.401 --> 36:44.035
you got a serious problem.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.071
Hakeem, I don't
have the problem.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.573
You have the problem.

36:47.606 --> 36:51.076
Clearly, you have a problem
being open and honest about us.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.511
Us?! There's no us.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.112
We friends.
We hooked up a couple times.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.915
That's it...
Stop fighting it, Hakeem!

36:56.948 --> 36:59.618
It is so clear
that you love me.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.520
I don't love you, so just get it

37:01.553 --> 37:03.188
through your damn head!
Understand?!

37:03.221 --> 37:06.925
I understand that every time
you are in need, you come to me.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.594
Me!

37:08.627 --> 37:11.597
Don't you see that?

37:11.630 --> 37:14.533
So what are you scared
of, Hakeem? Lucious?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.568
Because Lucious is the same one
that came to me

37:16.602 --> 37:19.204
and said that he was gonna
let you have a run at me.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.739
Cookie is a
little trickier,

37:20.772 --> 37:22.974
but once she understands
that I am...

37:23.008 --> 37:24.610
Stop! Stop talking
about my family!

37:24.643 --> 37:26.278
Stop talking about
my mother and father!

37:26.312 --> 37:27.946
You will never be
one of us.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.381
You won't ever be a Lyon.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.917
Ever!

37:31.950 --> 37:34.986
(panting, sniffling)

37:39.425 --> 37:40.759
(screams)

37:40.792 --> 37:42.227
(crying)

37:42.260 --> 37:43.795
(sniffles)

37:43.829 --> 37:45.831
(grunting, panting)

37:47.699 --> 37:49.401
Hey, I'll go
get a dust pan.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.836
Leave it alone.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.504
You want to talk
about it, sis?

37:52.538 --> 37:54.005
No, I do not.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.509
Cookie, listen, I know that
I've been a pain in the ass,

37:57.543 --> 37:58.744
but I'm really trying to...

37:58.777 --> 38:01.146
Carol, you got to go to rehab.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.414
No.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.982
Yes. Yes.
No.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.485
What are you talk...? No, I'm
not going to rehab. I got this!

38:06.518 --> 38:08.286
You're an addict.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.457
You've been one your whole life.
Say it.

38:11.490 --> 38:15.260
Cook, what happened
with Jermel is our fault.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.262
(crying): And it is
really messin' with me

38:17.295 --> 38:18.430
on the inside.

38:18.464 --> 38:22.200
Carol, it's messing
with me, too, okay?

38:22.233 --> 38:24.035
But the way you handle it?

38:26.037 --> 38:29.107
I should have never
brought you into this.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.576
None of it.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.280
But you got excuses.

38:35.313 --> 38:39.017
You got excuses,
and I don't care what you say.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.353
If you keep going down
this rabbit hole, Carol,

38:41.387 --> 38:43.188
you're gonna end up dead.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.123
You are going to kill yourself,

38:45.156 --> 38:47.158
and th I cannot
have on my heart.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.727
Do you understand?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.997
You get yourself clean,
or you can't stay with me.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.300
Okay?
Okay.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.335
(voice breaking):
I hear you.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.707
(playing soft, gentle melody)

39:12.718 --> 39:16.422
* People been talking about it

39:16.455 --> 39:19.925
* We won't just stand here
in silence *

39:19.958 --> 39:23.028
* Can't stop the fire
from rising *

39:23.061 --> 39:25.096
* Rising

39:25.130 --> 39:27.533
* Whoa-oh, oh-oh

39:27.566 --> 39:30.235
* People, don't you be afraid

39:30.268 --> 39:34.272
* So many innocent slain

39:34.305 --> 39:37.543
* This is an era for change

39:37.576 --> 39:40.278
* Change

39:40.311 --> 39:47.252
* Malcolm's probably
turning in his grave *

39:47.285 --> 39:53.258
* Every shade was
beautifully made *

39:53.291 --> 39:56.061
BOTH:
* And powerful

39:56.094 --> 40:00.265
* There's so much strength
in you and me *

40:00.298 --> 40:03.735
* Powerful

40:03.769 --> 40:06.938
* A breath away from victory

40:06.972 --> 40:10.576
* I matter, you matter

40:10.609 --> 40:13.912
* We matter, oh

40:13.945 --> 40:20.886
* Powerful...

40:20.919 --> 40:23.722
It's perfect.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.290
(piano continues playing)

40:25.323 --> 40:27.292
Thank you for seeing me.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.961
Thank you
for letting me see you.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.237
* I see a colorful future

40:39.270 --> 40:43.108
* Where skin
don't define any human *

40:43.141 --> 40:46.578
* And stars are
the only thing shooting *

40:46.612 --> 40:48.279
* Shooting

40:48.313 --> 40:50.315
* Oh, oh, oh-oh

40:50.348 --> 40:53.351
* Mothers
who bury their child *

40:53.384 --> 40:57.155
* How can we sit there
and hide? *

40:57.188 --> 41:00.291
* Change comes
when all take a stand now *

41:00.325 --> 41:02.961
* Stand up, stand up

41:02.994 --> 41:10.301
* Martin's speech still
echoes in my brain *

41:10.335 --> 41:15.674
* Every shade was
beautifully made *

41:15.707 --> 41:19.511
BOTH:
* And powerful

41:19.545 --> 41:22.480
* There's so much strength
in you and me *

41:22.514 --> 41:25.784
* Powerful

41:25.817 --> 41:29.721
* A breath away from victory

41:29.755 --> 41:33.525
* I matter, you matter

41:33.559 --> 41:36.895
* We matter, oh

41:36.928 --> 41:43.234
* Powerful...

41:45.270 --> 41:48.306
* Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh,
oh-oh-oh *

41:48.339 --> 41:52.243
* Oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh *

41:52.277 --> 41:57.215
* Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh,
oh-oh-oh *

41:57.248 --> 42:01.019
(in harmony):
* Powerful

42:01.052 --> 42:04.389
* There's so much strength
in you and me *

42:04.422 --> 42:08.026
* Powerful

42:08.059 --> 42:11.029
* A breath away from victory

42:11.062 --> 42:14.733
(in harmony):
* I matter, you matter

42:14.766 --> 42:18.336
* We matter, oh

42:18.369 --> 42:21.539
* I matter, you matter

42:21.573 --> 42:24.776
* We matter, oh

42:24.810 --> 42:30.916
* Powerful.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.251
(song ends)

42:33.284 --> 42:36.454
(sighs) Wow!

42:36.487 --> 42:39.090
I love it. I love it.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.159
(laughs)
Wow.

43:30.508 --> 43:30.876
Yeah.
