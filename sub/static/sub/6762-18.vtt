02:11.529 --> 02:13.402
- lt sure is cold here.
- l know.

02:13.572 --> 02:15.979
lf we're lucky,
maybe we'll have a white Christmas.

02:16.159 --> 02:17.701
That'd be kind of neat.

02:17.869 --> 02:20.905
- Hey, it was fun travelling with you.
- You too.

02:21.123 --> 02:22.700
And thanks for listening to me.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.741
What else was l gonna do
for 1 6 hours?

02:25.920 --> 02:27.912
Thanks a lot.

02:29.298 --> 02:32.833
Good luck, Steve. And l hope that,
you know, you find her.

02:33.303 --> 02:35.876
Well, everybody's got a real mom
out there somewhere, right?

02:36.098 --> 02:37.806
Harry, go get the car.
There's our baby.

02:37.975 --> 02:40.680
Hey, l gotta go. That's my mom.

02:40.853 --> 02:43.095
Merry Christmas.

02:44.065 --> 02:45.263
Merry Christmas.

02:49.738 --> 02:52.525
- How are you?
- Great.

03:51.724 --> 03:54.179
So over here
is our entire skin care line.

03:54.352 --> 03:57.306
Now, the kits come pre-wrapped.
The customers like it that way.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.397
Oh, and you remember what l told you
about filling out the invoices?

04:00.567 --> 04:01.598
l think so.

04:01.818 --> 04:03.810
Always add everything up
on the calculator first,

04:04.029 --> 04:07.564
- just to make sure the figures match.
- Okay.

04:08.576 --> 04:11.861
Don't worry. You'll do fine.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.947
Time to party.

04:17.461 --> 04:19.288
Diedre?

04:19.755 --> 04:21.249
Thanks for the opportunity.

04:22.383 --> 04:24.790
What the hell, it's Christmas.

04:26.721 --> 04:29.259
Good morning, ladies.

04:36.148 --> 04:37.346
Brenda.

04:37.567 --> 04:39.227
Hi, guys. What are you doing here?

04:39.444 --> 04:40.854
What do you mean?
l love this place.

04:41.029 --> 04:43.816
Besides, you're the first one
of my friends who's had a real job.

04:47.369 --> 04:49.445
So is there anything
that l can help you with today?

04:49.622 --> 04:50.997
Oh, please, listen to you.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.749
Come on, this is serious.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.501
Okay. Pretend like you're showing us
this jewellery so we can keep talking.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.463
All right, l really think
you should take a look at these.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.586
Oh, very nice.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.756
You know, l'm really starting
to get worried about Steve.

05:07.934 --> 05:10.472
- Yeah, he's been gone four days.
- Nobody's talked to him.

05:10.645 --> 05:13.314
His mom keeps calling my house.
She's totally freaked out.

05:13.482 --> 05:14.940
Maybe we shouldn't have let him go.

05:15.109 --> 05:18.608
- Kelly, what could we have done?
- l know, but...

05:19.113 --> 05:22.648
This really sounds weird,
but l miss him. l do.

05:22.826 --> 05:26.776
l mean, especially around Christmas,
you know?

05:26.955 --> 05:28.615
He'd always buy me
something really nice,

05:28.791 --> 05:30.783
even though we weren't going out.

05:31.252 --> 05:33.873
What if he never comes back?

05:34.464 --> 05:36.622
Look, guys,
why don't you come over tonight?

05:36.799 --> 05:38.957
Brandon and my dad are
out buying a Christmas tree

05:39.135 --> 05:42.385
and we'll all get together
and do sort of a tree-trimming thing.

05:42.556 --> 05:45.723
You guys haven't bought your tree yet?
There are only two days till Christmas.

05:45.893 --> 05:48.099
- We've had ours for a week.
- lt's a family tradition.

05:48.271 --> 05:49.931
We always wait two days
before Christmas.

05:50.106 --> 05:52.098
That way, you get the freshest tree.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.603
l mean, it's a family tradition.

05:53.777 --> 05:55.650
We always wait until two days
before Christmas.

05:55.821 --> 05:57.481
That way, we always get
the freshest tree.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.613
Dad, these trees
don't look too healthy.

05:59.783 --> 06:02.488
You should have been here a week
ago. We had lots of healthy trees.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.489
Look at this, the needles are brown.

06:04.706 --> 06:06.200
We've had a long hot dry spell.
Okay?

06:06.374 --> 06:09.244
We spray them with water every day,
but there's only so much you can do.

06:09.419 --> 06:10.877
The sun just wilts them.

06:11.046 --> 06:12.374
Come on. We'll go somewhere else.

06:12.548 --> 06:15.039
You're not gonna do better than here.
lt's the same all over.

06:15.217 --> 06:17.126
- We'll see. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

06:17.303 --> 06:18.334
Merry Christmas.

06:18.513 --> 06:20.920
Don't worry,
we'll get a great tree, you'll see.

06:22.058 --> 06:23.967
lt's 90 degrees here.

06:24.144 --> 06:26.350
Yes, that's right,
you heard me, nine-oh.

06:26.522 --> 06:29.392
l mean, l'm sitting here in my shorts.

06:29.984 --> 06:34.445
lt is? lt's really snowing?

06:34.614 --> 06:37.069
You're gonna have
a white Christmas.

06:37.242 --> 06:40.029
Oh, that's what l miss the most.

06:40.621 --> 06:43.159
Mom, l gotta go.
That's Jim and Brandon with the tree.

06:43.332 --> 06:45.953
Well, yes, of course,
we still have Christmas trees here.

06:46.127 --> 06:49.792
l'll call you later.
Listen, give my love to Dad. Bye-bye.

06:50.590 --> 06:53.757
- Come on, Brandon, lift!
- l am lifting, Dad.

06:54.553 --> 06:56.426
Let me see, let me see. Easy, easy.

06:59.934 --> 07:04.762
Jim, what happened to the tree?
l mean, it's--

07:04.981 --> 07:07.306
l think the word
you're looking for is ''dead,'' Mom.

07:07.484 --> 07:12.193
lt's not really dead,
it's just kind of wilted.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.235
What do you mean, wilted?
l mean, couldn't you find a green tree?

07:15.410 --> 07:16.441
Well, not in this heat.

07:16.619 --> 07:18.861
And not when you go to buy it
two days before Christmas.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.782
Come on, it's not really that bad.

07:21.708 --> 07:25.291
Yes, it is, Jim.
l'm sorry, but yes, it is that bad.

07:25.463 --> 07:27.372
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

07:27.590 --> 07:29.167
We should have gone back
to my mother's.

07:29.342 --> 07:32.343
Cindy, we did that last year. All of us
crammed into your parents' house.

07:32.512 --> 07:34.588
The trees are green
and there's snow on the ground.

07:34.765 --> 07:35.796
Honey, we live here now.

07:35.974 --> 07:38.512
We can't keep running back
to Minneapolis every Christmas.

07:38.686 --> 07:41.224
And l can't even cook.
l mean, who wants to eat in this heat?

07:41.397 --> 07:43.057
Let's not get crazy now, Mom, okay?

07:43.232 --> 07:46.648
Look, come on.
lt'll be a fine Christmas, you'll see.

07:46.820 --> 07:49.393
We've got to do something
about this tree.

07:56.205 --> 07:58.411
Brandon, what are you doing?

07:58.583 --> 08:00.908
Brenda,
you weren't supposed to see this.

08:01.086 --> 08:03.292
Why are you spray-painting
our Christmas tree?

08:03.463 --> 08:06.666
- Well...
- Oh, that's looking much better.

08:06.842 --> 08:09.878
Yeah, hang a little tinsel on it,
you won't be able to tell the difference.

08:10.096 --> 08:14.924
Well, Christmas in Beverly Hills.
l mean, it's not natural.

08:15.101 --> 08:17.674
l don't know, it seemed pretty natural
to the hordes of shoppers

08:17.854 --> 08:19.016
that were in the store today.

08:19.189 --> 08:20.220
Oh, how was the job?

08:20.399 --> 08:22.190
Exhausting.
But l made some good sales.

08:22.359 --> 08:25.028
l might be able to actually buy
you guys something nice this year.

08:25.196 --> 08:27.069
Oh, well, honey,
it's the thought that counts.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.354
You tell her, Mom.

08:28.533 --> 08:31.202
Yes, but good presents never hurt.
Right, Mom?

08:31.369 --> 08:33.077
l'm sure you guys understand
the importance

08:33.246 --> 08:35.155
of the giving spirit of Christmastime.

08:35.332 --> 08:38.368
Well, frankly, l'm having a hard time
thinking about Christmas at all.

08:38.544 --> 08:41.116
lt feels like the middle of August.

08:41.422 --> 08:44.921
Next year, we'll get a fake one.

08:47.804 --> 08:50.425
Was that Cindy Walsh
or Ebenezer Scrooge?

08:50.641 --> 08:52.633
Well, Mom's just having
a little trouble adjusting

08:52.810 --> 08:56.475
to Christmas here
in sunny Southern California.

08:57.065 --> 08:59.817
You gotta admit,
it does take some getting used to.

09:02.321 --> 09:04.397
So, what do you think?

09:04.573 --> 09:07.028
lt's the thought that counts.

09:18.422 --> 09:21.174
- You guys are so Christmassy.
- What do you mean?

09:21.342 --> 09:24.378
The lights on the house, the big tree,
all these old-fashioned ornaments

09:24.554 --> 09:27.045
that have probably been
in your family for generations.

09:27.224 --> 09:31.851
Kelly, they were giving these away
last year at Jack in the Box.

09:32.688 --> 09:35.475
ls there something wrong
with this tree?

09:35.650 --> 09:37.274
No. Why do you say that?

09:37.443 --> 09:40.148
l don't know.
lt's, like, kind of a funky colour.

09:40.321 --> 09:42.728
lt just got warped by the heat,
that's all.

09:42.908 --> 09:44.616
Spray paint?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.658
McKay, shut up and keep trimming.

09:51.334 --> 09:53.872
Still suffering
a little geographic dislocation?

09:54.045 --> 09:55.753
l guess so.

09:55.922 --> 09:58.792
- We'll get used to it.
- Thought we had.

09:58.967 --> 10:01.672
Listen, why don't we have
a Minneapolis Christmas right here?

10:01.846 --> 10:04.253
We can invite all the kids' friends over
for Christmas Eve,

10:04.432 --> 10:07.219
- start a new tradition.
- We could do that.

10:07.393 --> 10:09.469
Yeah, l bet a few of those kids
out there would love

10:09.646 --> 10:12.137
to be part of a real family Christmas.

10:13.358 --> 10:15.564
Oh, my God, l don't believe it!

10:15.736 --> 10:17.396
Oh, how cute.

10:17.571 --> 10:19.148
Those are from
when we were little guys.

10:19.323 --> 10:20.947
l haven't seen those in years.

10:21.117 --> 10:23.655
''And the stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

10:23.828 --> 10:25.655
in hopes that St. Nick
would soon be there.''

10:25.831 --> 10:27.455
Kelly, please, put those away.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.370
Cold apple cider.

10:30.252 --> 10:31.662
l'll go for that. Thanks, Mom.

10:31.879 --> 10:34.631
Well, you guys just couldn't wait
to get up those stockings, huh?

10:34.799 --> 10:35.830
Busted.

10:36.009 --> 10:38.844
Well, it's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

10:39.387 --> 10:41.842
Listen, everybody.
You know, back in Minneapolis,

10:42.015 --> 10:44.422
we always had these
huge Christmas Eve dinners.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.393
We'd invite our whole family
and friends

10:46.562 --> 10:48.471
and we'd exchange gifts
and sing carols.

10:48.648 --> 10:53.061
And they always ended up in this huge
snowball fight out in the backyard.

10:53.612 --> 10:57.396
Well, anyway, we're gonna skip
the snowball fight this year,

10:57.574 --> 11:00.694
but in honour
of our first Beverly Hills Christmas,

11:00.870 --> 11:04.321
l want to invite everyone
to spend Christmas Eve here,

11:04.499 --> 11:08.746
with your families,
and so we can begin a new tradition.

11:10.172 --> 11:12.248
Hey, come on, it'll be fun.

11:13.509 --> 11:15.086
Well, l'd love to Mrs. Walsh,

11:15.261 --> 11:18.048
but we're all going skiing
in Mammoth over Christmas.

11:18.515 --> 11:23.260
Oh, well, that's terrific.
What about you, Kelly?

11:23.437 --> 11:26.272
Well, for the first time
since l can ever remember,

11:26.440 --> 11:28.895
my mom is going to make
Christmas dinner at our house.

11:29.068 --> 11:31.060
We're having it with David Silver
and his dad.

11:31.529 --> 11:33.320
Really? Your mother's cooking?

11:33.531 --> 11:34.989
l'm afraid so.

11:35.158 --> 11:38.491
But she's happy about it.
l mean, it's weird.

11:38.704 --> 11:40.577
Oh, it's wonderful.

11:40.748 --> 11:42.290
What about you, Dylan?

11:42.500 --> 11:44.373
l assume you're gonna
spend Christmas with us.

11:44.544 --> 11:47.379
Actually, l'm gonna go
and visit my dad.

11:47.547 --> 11:49.789
You are? l thought
you were having dinner with us?

11:49.966 --> 11:52.504
Well, yeah, Bren, but l mean,

11:52.678 --> 11:55.632
my dad's alone in jail
and it is Christmas Eve.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.892
Of course, Dylan. l mean,
of course, you have to be with him.

11:59.102 --> 12:01.141
Thank you, though, for the invite.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.181
Hey, wait a second.
What about Steve?

12:03.356 --> 12:06.061
l knew somebody was missing.

12:07.736 --> 12:10.523
You guys,
Steve went to find his mother.

12:10.740 --> 12:13.278
- What?
- l thought his mother lived here.

12:13.701 --> 12:17.449
No. Supposedly,
she lives somewhere in New Mexico.

12:17.622 --> 12:18.736
His real mother, that is.

12:19.708 --> 12:20.906
Steve's adopted.

12:21.543 --> 12:23.203
l didn't know that.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.827
Yeah, she told him to go for it,
if it's what he had to do.

12:26.048 --> 12:28.040
Well, it's not as easy as it sounds.

12:28.217 --> 12:30.755
l mean, most parents
who give their kids up for adoption

12:30.929 --> 12:32.756
don't necessarily wanna be found.

12:32.973 --> 12:36.342
Well, l guess that's just something
Steve will have to deal with.

12:36.518 --> 12:38.843
That is, of course,
assuming he can find her.

12:39.063 --> 12:42.479
Brandon, l mean,
does he even know her name?

12:43.568 --> 12:45.607
All l know is that my mother's name
was Karen Brown

12:45.779 --> 12:48.104
and l was born May 1 5th,
1 7 years ago.

12:48.281 --> 12:50.154
Are you sure it was this hospital?

12:51.076 --> 12:53.068
No, but it was this town.

12:53.245 --> 12:54.655
Then it was probably here.

12:55.164 --> 12:57.287
Can l see some identification,
please?

12:57.500 --> 12:58.910
Yeah, sure.

12:59.085 --> 13:00.793
l don't know how
l've gotten along this far

13:00.962 --> 13:02.789
without having a copy
of my birth certificate.

13:03.006 --> 13:05.331
l'll be right back.

13:14.144 --> 13:18.058
Dr. Rosen, Dr. Rosen,
please call your office.

13:22.695 --> 13:24.568
ls that it?

13:25.031 --> 13:27.107
- lt appears so.
- Can l have it?

13:27.325 --> 13:30.445
l didn't realise you were under 1 8.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.909
Under the circumstances,
l'm going to have to request

13:33.082 --> 13:35.952
written permission from your mother
before l can relinquish the record.

13:36.127 --> 13:38.416
- You can't be serious.
- l'm afraid so.

13:39.505 --> 13:41.213
Look, Sister.

13:41.382 --> 13:45.296
l've travelled a long way to be here,
by bus, okay?

13:45.470 --> 13:47.759
So why don't we make
one little exception to the rule.

13:47.931 --> 13:50.932
- And it'll be our little secret, okay?
- l'm sorry.

13:51.143 --> 13:53.598
Come back after your parent
has signed this form.

13:53.813 --> 13:56.268
lf l knew who my real parent was,
l wouldn't be here.

13:59.319 --> 14:05.239
Okay, suppose l made a little donation
to your favourite charity.

14:07.662 --> 14:14.281
Yeah. l should've known you guys
aren't the types to go for bribes.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.043
Dr. Morgan,
please report to Emergency.

14:25.223 --> 14:26.468
You can look at it.

14:26.641 --> 14:29.558
Dr. Patrick,
report to Reception Area 2.

14:31.272 --> 14:33.597
But l can't let it leave this counter.

14:33.774 --> 14:35.647
Thank you, Sister.
Believe me, he'd be pleased.

14:38.822 --> 14:40.649
''Steven Brown.
Born the 1 5th of May

14:40.824 --> 14:44.275
in Albuquerque, New Mexico
to Karen Brown.''

14:44.787 --> 14:47.622
This is it. Look, this is me!

14:47.832 --> 14:49.908
l really was born here.

14:50.626 --> 14:51.657
Mother's mailing address.

14:51.836 --> 14:54.374
You don't mind if l write this down,
do you?

14:55.048 --> 14:58.796
5595 Navajo Trail.

15:01.722 --> 15:05.554
Merry Christmas, Sister.
l won't forget you for this.

15:07.395 --> 15:08.509
Merry Christmas.

15:15.654 --> 15:18.026
Order's up, Brandon!

15:18.616 --> 15:20.774
Come on, Nat, give me a break.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.327
Where's your
Christmas spirit, huh?

15:22.495 --> 15:24.368
lt always goes south
around cold burgers.

15:24.539 --> 15:26.033
- Come on, move, move.
- Yeah.

15:38.722 --> 15:40.549
Well, sir, what can l get for you?

15:40.724 --> 15:44.971
How about a nice cup of java,
on the house?

15:45.479 --> 15:47.270
On the house. That'd be nice.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.109
l'm kind of busted.

15:51.027 --> 15:53.185
Okay, sure.

15:53.363 --> 15:55.486
l'm kind of hungry too.

15:56.617 --> 15:58.775
Let me see what l can do.

15:59.412 --> 16:00.443
Hey, Nat,

16:00.621 --> 16:03.491
do you think we can rustle something
up for the old guy over there?

16:03.666 --> 16:06.750
l think he's homeless and,
you know, tomorrow's Christmas.

16:06.962 --> 16:10.295
- Jeez, it's already starting.
- What are you talking about?

16:10.466 --> 16:13.716
Well, every Christmas, l open up
the Peach Pit and serve free dinners.

16:13.886 --> 16:16.044
But it looks like they're starting
to flood in early.

16:16.681 --> 16:18.341
Why didn't you tell me?

16:18.516 --> 16:20.140
You spend Christmas
with your family.

16:20.352 --> 16:22.428
No, no way, forget it, l'll be here.
What time?

16:23.564 --> 16:25.473
Noon. But you don't have to.

16:25.691 --> 16:27.683
Nat, what am l gonna do,
abandon you on Christmas?

16:27.860 --> 16:29.687
- l'll be here, all right?
- Okay.

16:29.862 --> 16:32.151
So, what do l tell him?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.784
Get him the special.
But that's it, no substitutions.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.702
- Okay, Nat.
- l got something to show you.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.746
- Here you go, sir.
- Oh, thanks.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.004
- l got some food coming for you too.
- Oh, it'll be nice.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.710
l wear it every year.

16:52.888 --> 16:55.213
That's great.
l bet you make a great Santa Claus.

16:55.391 --> 16:57.467
What's that supposed to mean?

16:57.643 --> 16:58.971
Saved by the bell. Order's up.

16:59.145 --> 17:01.850
Come on, enough of this
Christmas cheer. Let's go.

17:02.065 --> 17:05.185
- Get that table, please.
- Okay.

17:20.002 --> 17:22.040
This is it.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.248
Wait a minute, this can't be it.

17:25.424 --> 17:28.875
5595 Navajo Trail.

17:29.053 --> 17:30.761
But l'm looking for a house.

17:30.931 --> 17:33.256
Oh, there used to be
some houses there.

17:33.475 --> 17:35.800
But that was a long time ago.

17:38.606 --> 17:41.476
Could you just take me back
to my hotel?

17:55.458 --> 18:00.369
- Don't you go to Beverly High School?
- No, l go to West Beverly.

18:00.672 --> 18:02.629
- Hey, chief.
- Hey, Brandon.

18:02.799 --> 18:04.293
Merry Christmas.

18:04.927 --> 18:06.089
Merry Christmas.

18:06.262 --> 18:10.010
- So, what can l do you for?
- Maybe a slice of that peach pie.

18:10.808 --> 18:11.839
Sounds like trouble.

18:12.018 --> 18:14.770
The only time you come in here
and eat pie is when you're depressed.

18:14.938 --> 18:17.144
What's the matter, Andrea,
you miss school already?

18:17.316 --> 18:20.685
Don't worry, we'll be back at school in
a week and the paper will still be there.

18:20.861 --> 18:23.530
- That's not it, Brandon.
- Well, then what is it?

18:23.698 --> 18:25.940
Oh, it's all this Christmas stuff.

18:27.118 --> 18:28.493
Christmas is bumming you out?

18:28.703 --> 18:31.573
We don't celebrate it, Brandon.
We don't celebrate Hanukkah, either.

18:31.748 --> 18:33.290
My parents think it's easier that way.

18:33.459 --> 18:36.875
You know, just kind of ignore both,
as if that is remotely possible.

18:37.088 --> 18:39.413
Don't feel left out. Why don't you
come over to my house?

18:39.591 --> 18:42.260
My mom makes a killer Christmas
dinner. She's dying for company.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.138
l can't. l promised my grandma
l'd go to the movies with her.

18:45.305 --> 18:47.712
She loves going on Christmas Eve.
There are never any lines.

18:47.891 --> 18:49.599
- So bring her with you.
- l don't know.

18:49.769 --> 18:53.434
Christmas isn't exactly her kind
of thing. You know what l mean?

18:53.606 --> 18:57.390
Excuse me. Brandon,
have you seen my Santa outfit?

18:57.569 --> 19:00.439
Well, yeah, you were just showing it
to me over here a second ago.

19:00.614 --> 19:05.739
l know. l brought it out,
an order came up and l put it down.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.322
Now it's gone.

19:07.538 --> 19:10.455
Nat, be real.
Who would steal a Santa Claus outfit?

19:10.667 --> 19:14.285
Merry Christmas, mates!
Merry Christmas to you!

19:14.463 --> 19:16.835
Merry-- Merry Christmas.

19:17.007 --> 19:19.165
Merry Christmas.
Take one home to the little one.

19:19.343 --> 19:22.213
Merry Christmas.

19:24.057 --> 19:26.096
Okay, there you go.

19:26.935 --> 19:29.093
- How's that?
- Perfect. Thank you.

19:29.271 --> 19:30.848
You're welcome.

19:31.023 --> 19:34.308
Merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas.

19:34.527 --> 19:40.363
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

19:40.534 --> 19:45.077
Here, Brenda, take care of this.
l gotta kick this nut out of here.

19:45.247 --> 19:48.616
- Be nice.
- Nice?

19:48.793 --> 19:51.545
After all, he is Santa Claus.

19:51.713 --> 19:53.337
Merry Christmas.

19:57.678 --> 20:01.213
l should send some of these designs
home to my elves.

20:01.432 --> 20:03.389
Very funny.
Would you mind leaving, please?

20:03.601 --> 20:06.139
Aren't you in need
of some Christmas cheer?

20:06.312 --> 20:11.021
All l'm in need of is a security guard
to keep nutcases like you out of here.

20:11.193 --> 20:13.185
Now, goodbye.

20:13.988 --> 20:16.111
Merry Christmas.

20:19.661 --> 20:21.950
Merry Christmas.

20:40.392 --> 20:42.847
- Hello.
- Hello. l'm looking for Karen Brown,

20:43.020 --> 20:45.427
- or a relative of Karen Brown.
- Who?

20:45.606 --> 20:48.726
Yeah, she gave birth to a son,
a baby boy, about 1 7 years ago and--

20:48.902 --> 20:50.526
Sorry, wrong number.

20:50.695 --> 20:54.645
Hello? Jerk.

21:09.425 --> 21:11.417
- Hello.
- Hi, l'm looking for Karen Brown,

21:11.594 --> 21:13.966
- or a relative of Karen Brown's.
- Who?

21:14.138 --> 21:16.676
Yeah, she gave birth to a son
about 1 7 years ago, a baby boy.

21:16.850 --> 21:19.139
Karen Brown or
a relative of Karen Brown's.

21:20.645 --> 21:22.970
She gave birth to a son
about 1 7 years ago.

21:23.148 --> 21:27.015
- l don't know about around here.
- No, l didn't think you would.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.103
Well, you have yourself
a merry Christmas.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.071
Merry Christmas to you too.

21:38.082 --> 21:41.166
- Here you go.
- Oh, great, thank you.

21:43.588 --> 21:46.209
Dylan. l thought you had left.

21:46.383 --> 21:48.210
What, are you kidding?
Without saying goodbye?

21:48.385 --> 21:50.543
Hey, is it totally unprofessional
to kiss you at work?

21:50.721 --> 21:53.805
- Yes, it is.
- Who cares?

21:54.558 --> 21:56.597
lt's Christmas.

21:56.853 --> 21:58.051
And where did you get this?

21:58.229 --> 22:00.554
Some crazy old Santa Claus outside
was handing them out.

22:00.732 --> 22:03.649
- They're probably poisoned.
- Oh, now, that's the Christmas spirit.

22:03.819 --> 22:06.191
Tell me, Bren,
what is the Christmas spirit, anyway?

22:06.363 --> 22:08.984
Go outside. People are shoving
each other on the sidewalk.

22:09.158 --> 22:10.818
They're fighting for parking spaces

22:10.993 --> 22:14.326
to go spend money that
they don't even have. For what?

22:14.497 --> 22:17.533
Everybody's forgotten what it's all
about, if they even knew to begin with.

22:17.709 --> 22:19.452
Well, l haven't.

22:19.628 --> 22:23.376
No, l bet that you haven't.

22:23.549 --> 22:26.254
So merry Christmas, Bren.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.638
Should l open it now?

22:29.806 --> 22:32.842
- Yeah, whenever.
- Now.

22:36.230 --> 22:39.433
Dylan, it's beautiful.
Where's the other half?

22:39.609 --> 22:41.186
lt's right here, with me.

22:44.614 --> 22:48.659
Dylan, l love it. And l love you.

22:48.869 --> 22:52.914
l know. l love you too, Bren.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.786
l wish you didn't have to go.

22:57.003 --> 23:02.673
Yeah, well, l know we've had our
differences and they have been major,

23:02.843 --> 23:04.586
but l just can't stand
the thought of my dad

23:04.762 --> 23:06.968
spending Christmas Eve alone
in a jail.

23:07.181 --> 23:08.379
l could go with you.

23:08.933 --> 23:12.681
No. You gotta spend Christmas
with your family, Bren.

23:12.854 --> 23:16.305
Besides, it's the first time l've seen him
since he's been in there and...

23:16.483 --> 23:20.481
Excuse me, miss? ls this gonna go
on sale the day after Christmas?

23:20.655 --> 23:22.731
Well, l don't really know.

23:22.907 --> 23:23.938
Merry Christmas, Bren.

23:24.117 --> 23:25.860
You know, last year,
l bought this gorgeous

23:26.036 --> 23:27.863
but outrageously expensive
leather jacket here

23:28.038 --> 23:31.122
two days before Christmas.
l come back a few days later

23:31.291 --> 23:34.660
only to notice that you have
slashed all the prices 40 percent.

23:34.837 --> 23:36.414
Now, l don't think that's fair, do you?

23:36.589 --> 23:37.999
l would like to buy the blouse now.

23:38.174 --> 23:40.001
lf l buy it now,
l should get the sale price,

23:40.176 --> 23:42.215
because after Christmas,
it's gonna be on sale.

23:42.429 --> 23:46.758
Hello, l'm looking for Karen Brown
or a relative of Karen Brown.

23:46.934 --> 23:49.603
She gave birth to a baby boy
1 7 years ago.

23:49.770 --> 23:52.308
Who is this? What do you want?

23:52.482 --> 23:56.017
Someone who needs to talk to her.
This is very important. ls she there?

23:56.194 --> 23:59.195
Hello? Hello?

24:15.382 --> 24:20.210
Mom, nothing's happening.

24:20.388 --> 24:22.760
Trust me. They're going to get stiff.

24:22.974 --> 24:24.966
- When?
- Patience.

24:25.143 --> 24:27.764
Please. Who died
and made you Julia Child?

24:27.938 --> 24:29.895
You haven't touched a spatula
in ten years.

24:30.065 --> 24:32.307
- Oh, my God!
- What?

24:32.485 --> 24:37.230
Damn. There goes
the cream of carrot soup.

24:42.079 --> 24:46.326
You know, Kel,
it makes me a little nervous to say this,

24:46.500 --> 24:50.996
but the way things are going with Mel,
l may even start cooking more often.

24:51.965 --> 24:54.634
Good, l think you need the practise.

24:55.427 --> 25:00.504
But seriously, l think it's important
that you realise how,

25:00.683 --> 25:03.435
well, important Mel
is becoming to me.

25:03.645 --> 25:05.554
And vice versa, l hope.

25:05.730 --> 25:08.600
l think, after six months,
l'm beginning to get the idea, Mom.

25:08.817 --> 25:09.848
You know,

25:10.027 --> 25:13.063
it's really the first totally healthy
relationship l can ever remember.

25:13.239 --> 25:18.696
And on top of everything else,
there is still that passion.

25:18.870 --> 25:21.112
About life, l mean.

25:21.832 --> 25:23.456
Well, l'm happy if you're happy.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.873
Thank you, sweetie.

25:26.795 --> 25:29.250
Mom, look! They're getting stiff.

25:29.423 --> 25:32.128
l told you.

25:33.219 --> 25:35.258
How weird.

25:36.097 --> 25:38.136
Keep beating.

25:40.644 --> 25:42.683
Coming.

25:45.942 --> 25:49.109
- Merry Christmas.
- Mel! How sweet.

25:49.279 --> 25:51.355
l'm not expecting you
for another few hours.

25:51.573 --> 25:55.108
l know, l know.
l just came early to drop those off.

25:55.286 --> 25:58.038
They're gorgeous. Come on,
l want to put them in some water.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.913
- Jackie, wait.
- What is it?

26:03.211 --> 26:07.078
l can't... l mean,
David and l can't come tonight.

26:07.591 --> 26:09.583
What? Why?

26:09.802 --> 26:12.507
Well, it's hard to explain.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.175
No, it's not really.
Sheila, David's mom--

26:16.351 --> 26:20.052
- Your wife.
- My soon-to-be ex-wife.

26:20.355 --> 26:23.142
Anyway, it's the first Christmas
we've been apart.

26:23.317 --> 26:25.689
She doesn't want David to come here.
She wants him home.

26:25.903 --> 26:28.987
Well, that's understandable.
But what about you?

26:29.157 --> 26:30.734
She wants me home too.

26:31.701 --> 26:34.192
Just for Christmas,
because she's depressed.

26:34.371 --> 26:36.114
Well, l can understand
how she feels.

26:36.331 --> 26:37.493
Pretty terrible, really.

26:37.666 --> 26:40.157
You should have heard her
on the phone. l'm a little worried.

26:40.336 --> 26:43.586
Frankly, Mel, l'm finding it a little hard
right now to sympathise with Sheila.

26:43.756 --> 26:45.713
- l'm not asking you to.
- Good.

26:45.884 --> 26:48.090
Because not only have l been
knocking myself out here,

26:48.261 --> 26:50.300
trying to figure out how to make
a Christmas dinner

26:50.472 --> 26:51.847
for all of us to enjoy together,

26:52.057 --> 26:55.592
but it also appears l've been making
a fool of myself for the last six months.

26:55.812 --> 26:59.228
Jackie, that's not true.
Now, we're talking about one night.

26:59.441 --> 27:03.142
Yeah, sure, one night
that just happens to be Christmas Eve.

27:03.987 --> 27:08.151
Mel, l took you seriously.

27:08.367 --> 27:11.072
l let down walls that have been up
longer than l can remember.

27:11.245 --> 27:15.159
l talked to my daughter about us.
l made up silly plans for us.

27:16.543 --> 27:18.749
- Oh, forget it. Here.
- No.

27:18.921 --> 27:20.960
You want me to stare at these
and think about you?

27:21.173 --> 27:24.957
- Jackie, you're overreacting.
- l don't think so.

27:25.261 --> 27:27.134
Merry Christmas.

27:27.305 --> 27:29.974
My best to your family.

27:32.811 --> 27:34.969
Merry Christmas.

27:44.282 --> 27:46.820
Oh, God, Kel.

27:51.707 --> 27:55.325
l feel so stupid.

28:17.820 --> 28:20.572
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.063
ls this your place?

28:23.117 --> 28:24.741
Well, yes, it is.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.697
l'm the guy who called
a little while ago.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.198
Oh, yeah?
Well, l don't wanna talk to you.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.706
Please, l need your help.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.660
l need to find Karen Brown.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.083
Just what are you after, kid?

28:39.260 --> 28:42.177
- Do you know her or not?
- Yes, l know her! l'm her father!

28:44.349 --> 28:45.380
l'm her son.

28:48.813 --> 28:50.852
Well, then...

28:52.317 --> 28:55.401
Why don't we go sit down?

29:02.119 --> 29:03.317
Hi, Brenda.

29:03.496 --> 29:07.244
- Kelly, what's wrong?
- Everything is a mess.

29:07.417 --> 29:10.453
You know that big dinner my mom and
l were making for David and his dad?

29:10.629 --> 29:12.253
Your mom forgot
to defrost the turkey.

29:12.422 --> 29:16.289
No. You're not gonna believe this,
but David's dad came over

29:16.469 --> 29:19.221
and told my mom that he wants to
spend Christmas with his wife.

29:19.639 --> 29:21.133
Oh, your poor mom.

29:22.559 --> 29:25.595
She likes him so much.
l'm not sure why, but she does.

29:25.771 --> 29:28.226
She doesn't even want to talk
to him now.

29:30.317 --> 29:34.397
Maybe if l buy her another present,
she'll feel better. You think?

29:35.365 --> 29:37.654
- Can l use your discount?
- Sure.

29:37.826 --> 29:39.534
But do you really think
that's gonna help?

29:40.621 --> 29:43.871
l just-- l hate the thought of us
spending Christmas Eve alone.

29:44.041 --> 29:47.540
l'm afraid she'll get all depressed
and start drinking or something.

29:47.754 --> 29:48.999
Why don't you two come over?

29:49.214 --> 29:51.586
Are you sure?
l mean, it's such short notice.

29:51.758 --> 29:55.590
- Who cares? We'd love to have you.
- Thanks.

29:55.763 --> 29:58.218
Hey, what are friends for
at Christmastime?

29:58.390 --> 29:59.932
See you later.

30:00.142 --> 30:02.099
- Be there at 7.
- Okay, we'll bring dessert.

30:02.270 --> 30:04.097
My mom made this incredible
chocolate mousse.

30:04.272 --> 30:06.229
You will not believe it.

30:07.275 --> 30:08.389
Hi, merry Christmas.

30:08.569 --> 30:11.404
- Been a good girl this year?
- Unfortunately.

30:11.572 --> 30:13.232
- Have you?
- Definitely.

30:13.950 --> 30:15.148
Can't fool Santa.

30:15.618 --> 30:17.445
l thought l asked you
to stay out of here.

30:17.662 --> 30:19.037
We were just having some fun.

30:19.247 --> 30:21.820
The young ladies are in need
of some Christmas cheer.

30:22.042 --> 30:25.292
Oh, well, l'm sure you know
just how to give it to them.

30:25.462 --> 30:27.454
Listen, why don't you take
your big white beard

30:27.631 --> 30:29.540
and your little red suit
right across the street

30:29.717 --> 30:31.756
and cheer up the security guards
over at Tiffany's?

30:31.928 --> 30:33.386
Merry Christmas.

30:34.014 --> 30:36.719
- Merry Christmas.
- Creep.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.518
Hi, l'm here to see Emily Valentine.

30:46.694 --> 30:48.069
- And your name?
- Brandon Walsh.

30:48.238 --> 30:50.111
Sign here
and l'll see if she's in her room.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.942
Thanks.

30:53.827 --> 30:56.365
- Brandon!
- Hi, Em.

30:59.459 --> 31:02.376
What are you doing here?
l look a mess.

31:02.587 --> 31:05.374
No, you don't. You look great.

31:08.469 --> 31:11.386
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

31:15.143 --> 31:18.428
Well, if you had any ideas l was crazy,
l guess they're confirmed now, huh?

31:18.647 --> 31:21.767
- l tried calling, you know.
- l know.

31:22.902 --> 31:26.353
My doctor thought it was best
l stay out of touch for a while.

31:26.697 --> 31:28.903
- Should l leave?
- No.

31:29.451 --> 31:31.657
lt's nice to see you.

31:33.705 --> 31:37.240
Look, l just want to say
l'm sorry for all that stuff--

31:37.418 --> 31:40.751
Emily, l didn't come here for that.

31:48.430 --> 31:50.802
This place has been
really good for me.

31:51.851 --> 31:53.724
Some people have a lot of stuff
in their heads

31:53.895 --> 31:56.137
they spend their whole lives
not dealing with.

31:57.398 --> 32:00.601
l'm gonna know myself really well
by the time l leave this place.

32:01.403 --> 32:04.108
- When's that gonna be?
- Soon.

32:04.281 --> 32:07.650
l may actually even go home tomorrow
for Christmas dinner.

32:08.661 --> 32:12.030
lt's going back to school
that's gonna be the real challenge.

32:12.207 --> 32:16.834
Maybe Andrea can write an article,
''Nutcase Returns to West Beverly.''

32:17.379 --> 32:19.704
No, l don't think so.

32:22.677 --> 32:26.093
Open it. Come on.

32:39.195 --> 32:43.193
Oh, my God! Your favourite shirt.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.029
Finally, it's mine.

32:46.245 --> 32:49.696
Well, l figured
if you wanted it that badly...

32:51.501 --> 32:53.992
- You're not getting it back, you know.
- Read the card.

33:02.763 --> 33:05.170
''Merry Christmas from all
your good friends at West Beverly:

33:05.349 --> 33:11.434
Brandon, Brenda, Dylan, Kelly,
Steve, Andrea, Donna, David.''

33:11.648 --> 33:12.846
They all would have been here,

33:13.025 --> 33:16.026
except you have this
ridiculously restrictive visitors policy.

33:17.822 --> 33:20.064
Thank you, Brandon.

33:21.326 --> 33:25.620
Hey, merry Christmas.

33:25.872 --> 33:27.745
Merry Christmas.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.790
l'll get it.

33:38.178 --> 33:40.336
What are you doing here?

33:41.723 --> 33:44.843
Since l'm not gonna see you tonight,
l just wanted to give you your gift.

33:45.895 --> 33:49.145
And what makes you so sure
l'd want a present from you?

33:49.524 --> 33:51.433
lt's not my fault, Kelly.

33:51.609 --> 33:54.064
Don't you think this is as bad for me
as it is for you?

33:54.279 --> 33:57.529
- What do you mean?
- Being caught in the middle like this.

33:57.699 --> 34:00.783
My mom using me as an excuse
to get my dad over for Christmas?

34:00.953 --> 34:03.870
And how do you think we feel, David,
being dumped on Christmas Eve?

34:05.291 --> 34:06.571
Look, l'm sorry.

34:07.127 --> 34:09.962
l like your mom and l really wanted
to spend Christmas with you guys.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.665
l thought you wanted your parents
to get back together.

34:14.426 --> 34:16.502
Well, l do.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.129
But l just didn't wanna see any...

34:20.350 --> 34:23.849
l didn't want to see you
and your mom get hurt.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.431
l'm not my dad, you know.

34:27.608 --> 34:29.435
l know.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.152
Still friends?

34:32.447 --> 34:34.356
l guess.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.239
Wait a second,
l have something for you.

34:37.702 --> 34:39.244
Don't open that in front
of your mom.

34:39.413 --> 34:41.286
- Why?
- lt vibrates.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.241
- David--!
- l'm just kidding! lt's a joke.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.908
l swear, l'm just kidding.

34:58.142 --> 35:01.178
- My name's Al.
- l'm Steve.

35:01.396 --> 35:03.223
l know your name.
l helped name you.

35:03.398 --> 35:06.019
- You did?
- l did.

35:07.152 --> 35:09.441
So does Karen, my mom,
does she live around here?

35:09.613 --> 35:10.941
Not anymore.

35:11.115 --> 35:13.784
- ls she married?
- She was.

35:13.951 --> 35:15.742
You think she'd be happy
to meet me?

35:16.788 --> 35:18.780
l think she'd be, yes.

35:20.542 --> 35:22.166
Why did she give me up?

35:23.003 --> 35:28.543
Well, your mother was very young
when you were born, Steve.

35:28.718 --> 35:31.921
Still in high school,
didn't have a husband.

35:32.097 --> 35:35.051
She wanted a home for her baby,

35:35.225 --> 35:38.558
a family to love him
and take care of him.

35:39.313 --> 35:40.723
l tended to agree with her.

35:41.357 --> 35:45.271
- So, what'd she do after high school?
- She went to college in Albuquerque.

35:45.445 --> 35:48.648
Met a nice young man, got married.

35:49.908 --> 35:52.660
That's why l couldn't find her name
in the book. She's changed it.

35:52.828 --> 35:54.986
That's it. To Mulligan.

35:56.457 --> 35:58.829
Does she ever talk about me,
think about me?

36:00.253 --> 36:03.123
l'm sure, in her private moments,
she did.

36:03.298 --> 36:05.290
But not around her family.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.294
Could l have her number, Al?

36:07.469 --> 36:09.461
l don't know why,
but l've got this strong feeling

36:09.639 --> 36:11.964
that l should be with her
at Christmas.

36:12.308 --> 36:13.932
l've gotta meet her.

36:14.102 --> 36:16.391
l've gotta know
who my real mother is.

36:16.605 --> 36:20.650
Well, that's gonna be kind of tough.
You see, in the first place,

36:20.818 --> 36:22.976
when she gave you up,
she made it pretty final.

36:23.195 --> 36:25.650
That's why she picked a good home.

36:25.823 --> 36:28.575
Has it been a good home, Steve?

36:28.827 --> 36:32.410
- Well, yeah.
- Good. That's the way it looks to me.

36:32.623 --> 36:35.956
But if l could talk to her, Al,
like l'm talking to you here now...

36:36.126 --> 36:38.699
l'm sure she could handle it.

36:39.464 --> 36:40.709
l'm her son.

36:42.091 --> 36:43.289
She died, Steve.

36:45.011 --> 36:47.928
- Karen's dead.
- What?

36:48.807 --> 36:53.018
A real bad auto accident,
not too far from here.

36:54.105 --> 36:55.515
Oh, my God.

36:57.692 --> 36:59.850
l'm sorry.

37:01.029 --> 37:05.358
l'm sure she would have liked
to have seen you.

37:07.328 --> 37:10.080
But she's gone.

37:25.682 --> 37:27.306
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Brandon.

37:27.475 --> 37:29.135
All right, the surprise is all in place.

37:29.311 --> 37:31.980
l'm worried that it's gonna make mom
more homesick than anything.

37:32.147 --> 37:34.353
Oh, don't worry about your mother.
She's gonna be fine.

37:34.525 --> 37:36.731
Especially after she sees
what l got her for Christmas.

37:36.903 --> 37:38.397
l'll get it!

37:38.571 --> 37:41.323
l hope you guys like turkey.
There's gonna be leftovers for months.

37:44.244 --> 37:47.198
Hi, l'm Samantha Sanders.
Steve's mom?

37:47.373 --> 37:51.786
Oh, yes, of course.
l'm sorry. Please, come in.

37:52.629 --> 37:56.543
- Oh, merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

37:56.716 --> 37:59.337
l'm sorry, but you look
just like you do on TV.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.969
Oh, God, l hope not.

38:01.180 --> 38:04.465
Oh, no. l mean, you look wonderful.

38:04.642 --> 38:07.809
Thank you. l'm sorry to disturb you.

38:07.979 --> 38:10.434
l wondered if you had heard anything
from Steve?

38:10.982 --> 38:16.059
No, l haven't. Brandon,
have you heard anything from Steve?

38:16.238 --> 38:17.566
No.

38:18.282 --> 38:20.773
l haven't heard a word for four days.

38:20.952 --> 38:22.944
Finally, today,
l just couldn't stand it anymore.

38:23.121 --> 38:24.781
l called the police.

38:24.956 --> 38:28.657
They're gonna file a missing
persons report in a few hours.

38:28.919 --> 38:31.208
l suppose he told you
where he was going.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.542
Yeah, he did.

38:33.883 --> 38:35.922
l never should have let him go.

38:36.094 --> 38:40.174
But he was so adamant,
so insistent on finding his real mother,

38:40.349 --> 38:44.810
that l thought standing in his way
would only make things worse.

38:44.979 --> 38:46.010
What an idiot.

38:46.188 --> 38:49.105
l'm sure he'll call tonight,
or tomorrow at the latest.

38:49.275 --> 38:53.320
l mean, it's not like Steve
to not call you on Christmas.

38:53.488 --> 38:55.196
l can't believe it, either.

38:55.365 --> 38:58.034
Nobody celebrates Christmas like l do.

38:58.202 --> 39:01.119
When Steve was little, he used to have
so many presents to open

39:01.289 --> 39:03.412
that by the time
he got through them all,

39:03.583 --> 39:06.500
he was too exhausted
to play with anything.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.118
Maybe that's it.

39:08.755 --> 39:10.628
Maybe l gave him
too many presents.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.208
Because whatever l did,
it just backfired.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.499
That's not true.

39:14.679 --> 39:19.140
l know Steve. He's a wonderful boy.
He's funny and warm.

39:19.350 --> 39:23.763
- You had everything to do with that.
- Maybe.

39:23.939 --> 39:27.142
Look, l don't want to burden you
with this on Christmas Eve.

39:27.318 --> 39:29.227
You'll let me know if he calls,
won't you?

39:29.403 --> 39:31.146
- l'll just be at home.
- No, you won't.

39:31.364 --> 39:33.440
You're staying right here
for Christmas.

39:33.658 --> 39:36.612
No, l couldn't. l really
should be there in case he calls.

39:37.079 --> 39:41.077
Please, l insist. Just for dinner.

39:42.126 --> 39:46.705
All right. lt'll be nice to be
with a friend of my son's.

39:47.715 --> 39:49.588
You bet.

40:04.693 --> 40:08.144
l always thought if l met my real mom,
maybe things would be different,

40:08.322 --> 40:10.777
that l'd figure out where l fit in.

40:10.950 --> 40:15.078
lt was a tough decision she made,
giving up her baby.

40:15.288 --> 40:18.408
l just wish l would have known her,
or at least met her.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.827
Well, she's part of you.
She's in you.

40:23.005 --> 40:26.208
So maybe in 50 years,
l'll look like you, huh?

40:26.509 --> 40:27.707
lf you're lucky.

40:31.514 --> 40:34.384
You know,
l never did have a grandfather.

40:37.813 --> 40:39.390
Would you be my grandfather, Al?

40:41.484 --> 40:42.859
lt'll be my pleasure.

40:43.069 --> 40:44.527
And we'll keep in touch?

40:44.696 --> 40:47.816
l'll send you cards and maybe
someday, you'll come visit me in L.A.?

40:47.991 --> 40:52.036
Sure thing. Merry Christmas.

40:52.746 --> 40:54.952
Merry Christmas to you.

40:55.208 --> 40:57.699
Do you think you could give me
a ride to the airport?

40:57.877 --> 41:00.415
l think l better be getting home now.

41:01.548 --> 41:03.873
l'll be glad to.

41:21.403 --> 41:23.976
You did great today, Brenda,
just great.

41:24.157 --> 41:27.193
- Have a merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

41:27.368 --> 41:30.404
- Okay, well, see you, bye.
- Bye.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.831
- Come on, let me see some lD.
- l don't have any lD.

41:36.003 --> 41:37.663
- Where do you live?
- North Pole.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.588
Smart. You got a place to live, pal?

41:39.799 --> 41:42.883
Take a bus to the shelter downtown.
You can get a free meal there tonight.

41:43.094 --> 41:44.754
Because you can't be hanging
around here.

41:44.930 --> 41:47.800
- Merry Christmas.
- Look, we're not fooling around here.

41:48.017 --> 41:50.093
- What's going on here?
- Don't worry about it.

41:50.269 --> 41:52.641
- l know this guy.
- You do?

41:53.481 --> 41:55.390
Yeah, he's Santa Claus.

41:56.651 --> 41:58.311
We have a complaint
from a store over here

41:58.487 --> 41:59.897
that he's been hassling shoppers.

42:00.113 --> 42:02.355
Has he been bothering you?

42:02.533 --> 42:05.818
No, in fact, l work there
and that's not true at all.

42:05.995 --> 42:07.703
Look, l didn't know the police

42:07.872 --> 42:10.279
were in the habit of hassling
Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.993
- Look, it's not that way at all.
- Merry Christmas.

42:15.005 --> 42:18.623
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:19.969 --> 42:24.631
- Do you have anywhere to go tonight?
- Oh, l have many houses to visit.

42:24.933 --> 42:27.424
Well, would you like to visit mine?

42:27.602 --> 42:29.641
l mean, l'm sure my mother
wouldn't mind.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.889
Actually, she might,
but she'll get over it.

42:32.066 --> 42:35.351
l just hate to see a Santa Claus alone
on Christmas Eve.

42:35.528 --> 42:38.813
Could my reindeer
wait for me on your roof?

42:38.990 --> 42:41.944
Absolutely.
Just try and use the door.

42:42.119 --> 42:46.947
My dad has this thing about strange
men sliding down our chimney.

42:48.417 --> 42:49.448
What can l do?

42:49.627 --> 42:51.666
Why don't you just go
in the living room and relax?

42:51.838 --> 42:54.507
No, really. l'd like to help.

42:55.217 --> 42:57.708
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

42:57.886 --> 43:00.092
Merry Christmas.

43:00.264 --> 43:02.671
- Jim Walsh.
- St. Nick.

43:03.184 --> 43:04.215
St. Nick.

43:04.769 --> 43:09.265
Dad, do you guys mind
if he stays for dinner?

43:09.441 --> 43:12.193
Brenda, who is he?

43:12.361 --> 43:14.733
Well, l sort of found him
outside the store.

43:14.905 --> 43:15.984
l felt really bad for him.

43:16.157 --> 43:18.564
He's this really sweet guy
and he has nowhere to go tonight.

43:18.743 --> 43:21.578
- Excuse us.
- Me too.

43:22.247 --> 43:25.698
- Oh, hi.
- Merry Christmas.

43:26.502 --> 43:28.459
Brenda, you can't just bring
some strange guy

43:28.629 --> 43:30.004
off the street home for dinner!

43:30.214 --> 43:33.962
Why not? Look, it is Christmas.
And he is Santa Claus.

43:34.135 --> 43:36.092
Well, who knows who's lurking
under that beard.

43:36.304 --> 43:38.427
My instincts tell me
that he's harmless.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.763
Oh, that makes me feel a lot better.

43:40.934 --> 43:43.425
Oh, l'll get it.

43:44.939 --> 43:46.433
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

43:46.649 --> 43:49.222
Jackie, Kelly, what a surprise.

43:50.153 --> 43:52.062
Brenda, you didn't tell your mom
we were coming?

43:52.239 --> 43:54.148
l haven't gotten around to it yet.

43:54.366 --> 43:57.071
- ls it all right?
- Oh, of course, of course.

43:57.286 --> 43:59.362
l thought you were having
Christmas dinner with Mel.

43:59.538 --> 44:02.373
- Mel. Mel who?
- What happened?

44:02.542 --> 44:06.041
Mel decided to spend Christmas Eve
with his ex at the last minute.

44:06.922 --> 44:08.416
l'm sorry.

44:08.632 --> 44:10.671
l have survived worse.

44:10.884 --> 44:14.217
- Okay, two more for dinner.
- Three.

44:15.431 --> 44:19.096
- All right, three.
- All right.

44:20.103 --> 44:23.638
Oh, it's beginning to feel
like a real Christmas.

44:25.442 --> 44:27.185
Hey.

44:30.490 --> 44:31.735
Hey.

44:33.118 --> 44:34.528
Merry Christmas.

44:34.703 --> 44:38.617
- l need to charter a plane.
- Oh, sorry. l'm just closing up here.

44:38.791 --> 44:39.989
l've checked all the airlines.

44:40.167 --> 44:42.456
Every flight to L.A.
is booked solid through tomorrow.

44:42.628 --> 44:44.667
l've gotta get home tonight.
This is an emergency.

44:44.839 --> 44:48.006
Wish l could help you,
but this is Christmas Eve.

44:48.176 --> 44:50.749
Obviously, l've got places to go.

44:50.971 --> 44:54.672
Come on! Look, it's a quick hop to L.A.
You'll be home before you know it.

44:54.850 --> 44:58.598
l'd like to, but...

45:00.148 --> 45:02.721
Please, you've gotta help me.
l'm desperate. l'll pay anything.

45:02.901 --> 45:06.068
Look, if this isn't enough,
l'll mail you a cheque for more.

45:18.668 --> 45:21.669
Hold on there, now.

45:22.548 --> 45:23.923
Let me think.

45:25.927 --> 45:29.343
Now, Dasher, now, Dancer,
now, Prancer and Vixen.

45:29.514 --> 45:32.087
Could you take it easy
with the reindeer stuff?

45:32.267 --> 45:33.677
You're beginning
to make me nervous.

45:33.852 --> 45:38.597
On Comet, on Cupid,
on Donner and Blitzen!

45:45.907 --> 45:48.149
Help yourself, everybody.
There's more than plenty.

45:48.327 --> 45:50.485
Oh, my God, Cindy,
this all looks incredible.

45:50.663 --> 45:51.742
You mean tastes incredible.

45:51.914 --> 45:54.950
l haven't seen a Christmas dinner
like this in a long time.

45:55.126 --> 45:56.454
Can l take your sack?

45:56.628 --> 46:02.168
No, no, no. l'll just hang on to it,
if it's all the same to you.

46:03.218 --> 46:05.009
Oh, l'll get it. l mean...

46:05.179 --> 46:08.049
Oh, well, let's both get it.

46:11.311 --> 46:13.600
- Merry Christmas.
- Andrea, how nice to see you.

46:13.772 --> 46:16.097
Well, l told Brandon
l might drop by.

46:16.275 --> 46:17.983
Here. My grandmother
made you a brisket.

46:18.152 --> 46:21.936
Oh, thank you. Oh, l'm sorry, Andrea,
This is Mrs. Sanders.

46:22.114 --> 46:24.023
Steve's mom.
l've heard a lot about you.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.445
You have?

46:25.618 --> 46:27.610
Excuse me.

46:27.871 --> 46:28.902
- Andrea!
- Hi, Brandon.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.194
l'm glad you could make it.

46:30.374 --> 46:32.699
Well, l've never been
to a real Christmas dinner before

46:32.876 --> 46:35.746
and l'm dying to try some
of that plum pudding.

46:35.921 --> 46:38.957
l hate plum pudding.
Hey, everybody, look who's here!

46:39.133 --> 46:42.466
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, Andrea.

46:50.813 --> 46:52.355
Merry Christmas.

46:52.857 --> 46:56.273
And merry Christmas to you.

46:58.488 --> 47:01.358
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, merry Christmas.

47:01.533 --> 47:04.320
And who are you here to visit?

47:06.122 --> 47:07.236
My father.

47:07.415 --> 47:11.792
Well, good luck, son,
and merry Christmas.

47:25.227 --> 47:27.136
Dylan.

47:29.606 --> 47:31.978
What a great surprise.

47:32.735 --> 47:37.730
Here. l got you some stuff.
lt's not a lot.

47:37.907 --> 47:41.027
l just thought it would keep you
entertained in here.

47:45.124 --> 47:46.155
Thanks for coming.

47:50.421 --> 47:53.042
l just guess l never expected
to see you here.

47:54.468 --> 47:55.878
Why?

47:56.595 --> 48:02.550
Well, because l just figured that
you kind of hated me right about now.

48:02.768 --> 48:04.345
No.

48:07.440 --> 48:11.390
No, l don't hate you, Dad.

48:11.570 --> 48:13.361
But when l think about all
the Christmases

48:13.530 --> 48:16.780
that l spent alone with the maid
while you were off in the Bahamas,

48:16.951 --> 48:21.245
or skiing, or somewhere
with one of your girlfriends...

48:23.208 --> 48:24.702
l guess l finally wanted you to know

48:24.876 --> 48:26.785
what it was like to be
lonely at Christmas.

48:28.130 --> 48:30.169
And then l remembered
how much it hurt.

48:30.341 --> 48:33.544
As much as l wanted to,

48:34.345 --> 48:37.014
l just couldn't leave you hanging
on Christmas Eve.

48:37.182 --> 48:38.973
Yeah.

48:39.810 --> 48:42.016
Well, you know something, son, l...

48:42.187 --> 48:45.390
You know, sometimes l think
of this place like a monastery.

48:46.484 --> 48:48.642
And l'm this monk.

48:49.070 --> 48:51.276
Because all l do is

48:52.115 --> 48:57.192
think and read and eat bad food.

48:57.705 --> 48:59.947
l always used to hate people
who meditated.

49:00.124 --> 49:01.582
- Yeah, like Mom.
- Yes.

49:01.793 --> 49:06.372
Yes, it always drove me crazy.
l thought it was weak.

49:07.215 --> 49:12.043
But l guess that's what l do now.
l meditate.

49:14.390 --> 49:19.729
And l think about you, Dylan,
and what a strong son l have,

49:21.440 --> 49:25.983
who's out there in the world,
all alone, just like l was.

49:26.195 --> 49:28.187
And here l thought
it was supposed to get better.

49:28.364 --> 49:30.736
You know, the next generation.

49:31.743 --> 49:34.198
Yeah, l thought so too.

49:35.247 --> 49:36.789
Yeah.

49:39.335 --> 49:41.493
You'll make things better, Dylan.

49:41.671 --> 49:43.996
You are already
making things better.

49:49.763 --> 49:54.425
There's some food in there.
lt's nothing fancy.

49:55.561 --> 49:59.393
Maybe we could have dinner.

50:00.316 --> 50:02.889
Do you still have that girlfriend?

50:03.362 --> 50:05.604
Brenda. Yes, l do.

50:12.830 --> 50:15.831
Well, you go have Christmas
with her, Dylan.

50:18.170 --> 50:19.249
Why?

50:19.421 --> 50:23.549
Because you have given me probably
the greatest Christmas present

50:23.718 --> 50:26.553
that l could ever ask for,
more than l deserve.

50:26.721 --> 50:28.381
Now you go
and make yourself happy.

50:28.556 --> 50:30.429
Dad, l'm here for you.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.889
Bren's got her own family.

50:33.061 --> 50:36.644
- l don't want you to be alone.
- Hey.

50:39.485 --> 50:41.109
l'm not alone anymore.

50:43.448 --> 50:44.990
Merry Christmas, son.

50:53.918 --> 50:56.290
Merry Christmas, Dad.

50:56.671 --> 50:59.244
So, Andrea, what'd you think
of your first Christmas dinner?

50:59.424 --> 51:00.538
Now l have to try...

51:00.717 --> 51:02.460
- Did you make this?
- Yes.

51:02.636 --> 51:05.637
- That was a wonderful dinner, Cindy.
- Thank you.

51:05.848 --> 51:10.225
Santa never goes anywhere without
generously rewarding his hosts.

51:10.436 --> 51:13.188
- No, that's really not necessary.
- No, no, no, l insist.

51:13.356 --> 51:14.387
Where did you get this?

51:14.566 --> 51:19.109
From my little elves, of course.
Go on, open it.

51:20.197 --> 51:22.902
Oh, it's beautiful.

51:23.076 --> 51:27.074
- What's this?
- A gift from Santa.

51:30.167 --> 51:34.331
- And this one's for you.
- For me?

51:35.381 --> 51:39.331
They're beautiful. Mom, Dad, look.

51:40.428 --> 51:44.011
Wow, Tiffany.

51:44.182 --> 51:46.851
l don't know
if we can accept this gift.

51:47.019 --> 51:48.347
Of course we can.

51:48.521 --> 51:51.724
And let me see here.
This one's for you.

51:51.899 --> 51:54.900
- Oh, l couldn't.
- Well, of course, you could.

51:55.070 --> 51:58.154
Santa has something for everybody.

51:58.740 --> 52:01.195
l don't know what to say.

52:01.702 --> 52:03.445
We sell those in my store.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.997
You know, l hate to say this,

52:06.165 --> 52:08.952
but Brenda finds
this homeless man on the street--

52:09.127 --> 52:12.211
With a bagful
of expensive merchandise.

52:12.381 --> 52:15.168
Excuse me.
l'm gonna go count the silver.

52:19.430 --> 52:21.885
Hi, l'm Mel Silver.
l think you know my son.

52:22.058 --> 52:24.264
Yes, of course.
Come on in. Hi, David.

52:24.436 --> 52:26.475
Hi, Mrs. Walsh.

52:27.481 --> 52:30.980
- ls Jackie here?
- Hello, Mel.

52:33.488 --> 52:34.863
Could l talk to you alone?

52:41.788 --> 52:43.864
Excuse me.

52:46.085 --> 52:50.498
l'm really sorry, Jackie.
l screwed up, l really blew it.

52:50.715 --> 52:52.209
You sure did.

52:52.425 --> 52:58.048
l made a stupid, stupid mistake.
l just wanna...

52:58.641 --> 53:03.469
l thought she was in trouble,
that l owed it to her to be there.

53:03.980 --> 53:06.850
But you can't hold on forever.
There's a point where,

53:07.025 --> 53:09.777
when you separate,
you just gotta really separate.

53:10.571 --> 53:12.279
l'm sorry it didn't work out for you.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.485
l never went.

53:15.034 --> 53:18.818
l just drove around,
torturing myself, feeling like a jerk.

53:18.997 --> 53:20.159
Until it hit me.

53:23.585 --> 53:26.420
You're the one l wanna be with,
Jackie.

53:26.672 --> 53:28.499
l love you.

53:29.008 --> 53:32.459
l'm really in love with you, Jackie.

53:37.434 --> 53:39.426
What happened?

53:39.603 --> 53:42.308
He thought my mom was in trouble
and he owed it to her to be there.

53:42.481 --> 53:43.643
But he can't hold on forever.

53:43.816 --> 53:46.223
There's a point when you separate,
you just gotta separate.

53:46.402 --> 53:49.818
He never went. He drove for a while
torturing himself, feeling like a jerk.

53:49.990 --> 53:52.315
- And then it hit him.
- Okay, David, that's enough.

53:52.534 --> 53:54.859
Merry Christmas, Kelly.

53:55.287 --> 53:57.612
Merry Christmas, David.

53:57.790 --> 53:59.782
l'll get it.

54:03.797 --> 54:05.955
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

54:06.174 --> 54:09.091
Well, there was no snow in Mammoth,
so we came home.

54:09.261 --> 54:10.292
Oh, my goodness.

54:10.471 --> 54:13.140
And l thought we were just gonna
have a quiet little Christmas.

54:13.307 --> 54:16.391
- Oh, well, l can leave, if you want.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, Donna.

54:16.561 --> 54:17.889
Just go on in and join the party.

54:18.063 --> 54:20.850
l've just gotta go upstairs
and check on something.

54:21.650 --> 54:23.642
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:23.819 --> 54:26.108
Excuse me.

54:29.325 --> 54:32.943
l don't believe this.
Vintage World War l dog tags.

54:33.121 --> 54:36.656
- Outstanding. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:37.167 --> 54:39.836
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

54:40.004 --> 54:42.293
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

54:42.966 --> 54:45.255
No snow, and they're back together.

54:45.468 --> 54:47.757
Donna, you'd better watch
where you're standing there.

54:47.929 --> 54:49.637
Why?

54:52.309 --> 54:54.348
Merry Christmas.

54:56.898 --> 54:58.974
Merry Christmas.

55:01.319 --> 55:05.103
Look, everyone, l hate to be the first
to leave a really good party,

55:05.282 --> 55:07.524
but l should be going home.

55:07.743 --> 55:10.115
- l understand.
- Good night, everyone.

55:10.329 --> 55:13.116
- Good night. Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

55:13.291 --> 55:15.367
Merry Christmas.

55:15.710 --> 55:18.746
Are you sure that
there's nothing we can do?

55:18.922 --> 55:21.045
Just pray that he's okay.

55:21.217 --> 55:23.375
Say good night to Cindy for me.

55:23.553 --> 55:27.800
And thank you for being there.
My son has some wonderful friends.

55:27.974 --> 55:32.766
- Jim! Come up here, quick!
- Excuse me.

55:36.233 --> 55:37.264
What is it?

55:37.485 --> 55:40.402
Well, he didn't touch the silver,
but he's taken my engagement ring!

55:40.613 --> 55:41.988
- Are you sure?
- l'm positive.

55:42.157 --> 55:44.778
l came up here to check the jewellery
and it's gone.

55:44.993 --> 55:47.566
- Well, is anything else missing?
- No.

55:47.746 --> 55:49.988
Brenda brings some eccentric
street person into our home

55:50.166 --> 55:54.994
carrying a bagful of presents from the
most expensive stores in Beverly Hills.

55:55.171 --> 55:56.202
And well, l'm sorry,

55:56.381 --> 55:58.373
as much as l would love to believe
in Santa Claus,

55:58.550 --> 56:01.302
l'm beginning to find it all
very suspicious.

56:03.722 --> 56:07.589
- What are you doing?
- l'm calling the police.

56:08.436 --> 56:10.843
l'm sorry, Jim,
but it's our own fault, really.

56:11.022 --> 56:13.513
l mean, we're just too generous,
too trusting, too naive.

56:13.692 --> 56:16.942
l mean, we've got to learn
to be a little street-smart.

56:17.613 --> 56:19.652
What are you doing?

56:21.075 --> 56:25.951
- What's this?
- Well, open it.

56:26.665 --> 56:31.790
l was gonna wait until tomorrow,
but under the circumstances...

56:33.923 --> 56:36.212
My ring! But when did you--?

56:36.384 --> 56:40.168
l took it to the jeweller
to have it reset over a week ago.

56:40.347 --> 56:42.636
l didn't even notice it was gone.

56:42.808 --> 56:44.966
l only took it off
because the stone was loose.

56:46.812 --> 56:49.813
l hardly recognise it.
lt's just gorgeous.

56:50.024 --> 56:53.808
Well, when l asked you to marry me,
l couldn't afford much.

56:53.987 --> 56:56.560
So l always promised myself that,
if l ever had the money,

56:56.740 --> 57:00.323
l'd make up for it
and give you something special.

57:00.536 --> 57:04.700
Oh, Jim. You didn't have to.

57:05.667 --> 57:09.415
But l love it. And l love you.

57:09.588 --> 57:11.415
And l love you too.

57:11.590 --> 57:15.173
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

57:17.388 --> 57:19.961
- Oh, l feel like such a grinch.
- Why?

57:20.767 --> 57:24.681
Suspecting that poor sweet man
of stealing my jewellery.

57:24.855 --> 57:28.473
l don't blame you.
He is a little hard to figure out.

57:28.651 --> 57:30.311
Let's not try.

57:30.486 --> 57:33.321
l mean, just for tonight,
l'm gonna stay naive

57:33.489 --> 57:36.988
and pretend that people are honest
and it's a safe world we live in.

57:37.160 --> 57:41.537
And there really is a Santa Claus and
he's sitting in our living room right now.

57:41.707 --> 57:46.334
Why not? l mean, he's gotta spend
Christmas Eve somewhere.

58:09.655 --> 58:11.482
Steve?

58:12.366 --> 58:14.405
Steve?

58:16.245 --> 58:18.818
- Steve!
- Mom, where have you been?

58:18.998 --> 58:20.278
Where have l been?

58:20.458 --> 58:22.331
l've been waiting an hour
for you to come home.

58:22.502 --> 58:24.079
You don't know what it took
to get here.

58:24.254 --> 58:26.923
l don't think you'll be happy
when you find out how much it cost.

58:27.091 --> 58:29.664
Hush up and hug me.

58:30.219 --> 58:33.339
- l'm sorry, Mom.
- l know.

58:33.515 --> 58:35.258
But you're here now.

58:35.434 --> 58:39.432
l had to do it. l had to find out
who my real mom was.

58:40.773 --> 58:43.643
And was she everything
you expected?

58:43.860 --> 58:45.188
Everything and more.

58:46.696 --> 58:49.531
- l see.
- Let me tell you about her.

58:49.699 --> 58:55.951
She's beautiful and she's caring.

58:57.250 --> 59:03.253
And she created me out of her love,
1 7 years of it.

59:04.216 --> 59:05.247
And with her busy life,

59:05.425 --> 59:08.461
she always made sure
l was as happy as l could be.

59:09.013 --> 59:12.429
She always tried to show me
to do the right thing.

59:13.768 --> 59:15.595
She was always there for me
when l didn't.

59:15.812 --> 59:19.347
Gave me everything l ever wanted
and probably more than l deserved.

59:19.524 --> 59:24.649
And no matter what, she always
let me know how much she loved me.

59:26.365 --> 59:29.282
l'm sorry l had to go so far away
to find you, Mom.

59:30.286 --> 59:34.948
Oh, gorgeous.
l'm just so glad you're back.

59:37.127 --> 59:40.626
- And l promise you one thing.
- What's that?

59:40.798 --> 59:43.289
l'll never leave you
on Christmas again.

59:49.141 --> 59:50.849
Well, l think l've been
a pretty good girl.

59:51.018 --> 59:53.639
- Wouldn't you say, Bren?
- More or less.

59:54.313 --> 59:56.602
But l'm not really into Christmas.

59:56.774 --> 59:59.858
l mean, l like it,
it just kind of bums me out.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:01.315
Why's that?

01:00:01.738 --> 01:00:05.154
Well, you know how Christmas
is always everybody's favourite holiday,

01:00:05.326 --> 01:00:07.947
except their own birthday?

01:00:08.246 --> 01:00:11.994
Well, my birthday is on Christmas
and nobody ever remembers.

01:00:12.167 --> 01:00:14.740
They give me Christmas presents
and call them birthday presents,

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.411
or give me birthday presents
and call them Christmas presents.

01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:19.996
And l never get a cake
or my own party.

01:00:21.802 --> 01:00:25.218
Happy birthday to you

01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:27.589
Happy birthday to you

01:00:27.767 --> 01:00:31.468
Happy birthday, dear Donna

01:00:31.647 --> 01:00:35.561
Happy birthday to you

01:00:38.446 --> 01:00:40.569
- l'll get it.
- Who's next?

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.150
Andrea.

01:00:42.325 --> 01:00:44.863
- Come on, Andrea. Come on.
- Oh, come on-- Oh, please, guys--

01:00:47.957 --> 01:00:49.285
Merry Christmas, Bren.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.536
Dylan, l can't believe you're here!

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.003
How's your dad?

01:00:59.595 --> 01:01:02.264
He's good. He's doing real good.

01:01:02.431 --> 01:01:06.642
lt's nice to see the Christmas spirit
finally penetrate the McKays.

01:01:07.645 --> 01:01:10.136
- Mom, Dad, guess who's here!
- We see.

01:01:12.317 --> 01:01:16.564
- Merry Christmas, Dylan.
- Merry Christmas.

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.612
Merry Christmas, sir.

01:01:18.783 --> 01:01:21.155
Merry Christmas, Dylan.

01:01:22.328 --> 01:01:24.320
Even when l was little,
l didn't believe in Santa.

01:01:24.497 --> 01:01:26.370
l thought it was pointless to ask
for anything.

01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:28.249
We didn't have a chimney
or Christmas tree,

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:31.335
but l don't know,
somehow, sitting here makes me...

01:01:31.505 --> 01:01:32.915
What the hell.
You know what l want?

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.842
l want a computer date book,
l want bubble bath, oh, and there's--

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:37.504
Hey, everybody, look who's here.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.918
- Hi, Dylan!
- Hey, Dylan.

01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:43.014
Merry Christmas, man.
How's the old man?

01:01:43.852 --> 01:01:45.809
Didn't l see you somewhere
earlier today, Santa?

01:01:46.021 --> 01:01:49.472
l don't think so.
l've been here the whole evening.

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.726
Just who are you, anyway?

01:01:51.903 --> 01:01:56.316
What's wrong? Doesn't anybody
believe in Santa anymore?

01:01:56.533 --> 01:01:58.442
Oh, come on, this is Beverly Hills.

01:01:58.619 --> 01:02:00.362
There's a Santa lurking
around every corner.

01:02:00.538 --> 01:02:02.945
- You have to know where to find him.
- Kelly!

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:07.291
l wanted to know what happened
to the magic of Christmas.

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:10.463
l didn't believe it existed anymore.

01:02:10.632 --> 01:02:12.505
You see, for over 40 years,

01:02:12.676 --> 01:02:17.671
Mrs. Claus and l lived in
a big house high up on the hill,

01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:22.013
and she made
the most wonderful Christmas dinner.

01:02:22.187 --> 01:02:27.644
We had a big tree with loads
of presents for lots of little elves.

01:02:27.818 --> 01:02:31.151
But the elves grew up
and they moved away,

01:02:31.322 --> 01:02:35.865
some of them, far away,
and had elves of their own.

01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:38.069
Santa used to visit them UPS

01:02:38.246 --> 01:02:42.160
and Mrs. Claus always made sure
they got their gifts on time.

01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:47.828
And even though it was only
she and Santa left in this big house,

01:02:48.007 --> 01:02:53.594
she still made
the most splendid Christmas dinners.

01:02:54.598 --> 01:02:59.723
But last year, Mrs. Claus died.

01:03:02.357 --> 01:03:06.651
And as far as l was concerned,
Christmas died with her.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:11.031
l wanted to pretend that Christmas
didn't exist anymore,

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:17.702
but something inside of me
told me to go looking for it anyway.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.198
l was beginning to believe

01:03:20.377 --> 01:03:24.457
the only place Santa belonged
in this town was in jail.

01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:29.799
Until that girl took in
a lonely old man for dinner.

01:03:31.389 --> 01:03:33.262
Thank you, Brenda,

01:03:33.433 --> 01:03:37.098
for making me believe again
in the spirit of Christmas.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.353
You're welcome.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:46.060
l don't know who it could be.
Everybody we know is already here.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:52.786
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas

01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:57.249
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year

01:03:57.418 --> 01:04:01.795
Good tidings we bring
To you and your kin

01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:06.294
Good tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:10.717
We all know that Santa's coming
We all know that Santa's coming

01:04:10.892 --> 01:04:15.519
We all know that Santa's coming
And soon will be here

01:04:16.273 --> 01:04:19.808
Oh, it's great. Happy now?

01:04:19.985 --> 01:04:24.398
Good tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year

01:04:24.574 --> 01:04:29.035
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas

01:04:29.204 --> 01:04:36.832
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year

01:04:38.339 --> 01:04:40.378
Why don't you all
come in for drinks?

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.542
We have a lot of places to cover
down the street.

01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:43.875
Hey, come on, Nat.

01:04:44.054 --> 01:04:46.545
You guys go and then l'll catch up
with you down the street.

01:04:46.723 --> 01:04:49.214
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, l like that.

01:04:49.393 --> 01:04:52.513
- Merry Christmas, Nat.
- Merry Christmas.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:55.095
That reminds me.
l found my Santa outfit.

01:04:55.274 --> 01:04:57.516
The busboy moved it
and put it under the counter.

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:59.437
- Cool.
- Hey, come on, everyone.

01:04:59.613 --> 01:05:02.020
Let's go in the living room
and sing some carols of our own.

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:04.191
Oh, Jim, you're not gonna play
the organ, are you?

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.740
As a matter of fact, l am.

01:05:09.415 --> 01:05:11.324
Give him a break, Mom.
lt is the holiday season.

01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:13.707
Okay, come on.

01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:23.130
All right, come on in, everyone.
Gather around.

01:05:23.348 --> 01:05:28.259
Here we go. All right.
Now, we all know this one.

01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:36.561
l'm dreaming of a white Christmas

01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:40.907
Just like the ones l used to know

01:05:41.451 --> 01:05:47.620
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:52.120
To hear sleighbells in the snow

01:05:52.297 --> 01:05:54.124
Oh, my God, Jim! lt's snowing!

01:05:54.299 --> 01:06:00.005
l'm dreaming of a white Christmas

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.430
With every Christmas card l write

01:06:07.438 --> 01:06:12.065
May your days be merry and bright

01:06:14.863 --> 01:06:18.030
- Brandon! What's going on here?
- l don't know, man. You tell me.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.905
He was waiting for me when l got
home, wondering where l had been.

01:06:21.079 --> 01:06:23.036
- Can you imagine?
- Merry Christmas, buddy.

01:06:23.206 --> 01:06:25.448
- lt's good to see you.
- lt's good to see you too, man.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.617
lt's great to be home, really.
You know what else?

01:06:27.795 --> 01:06:29.253
- What?
- l'm starving.

01:06:29.421 --> 01:06:32.541
Well, come on,
you came to the right place.

01:06:36.137 --> 01:06:42.092
l'm dreaming of a white Christmas

01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:46.563
Just like the ones l used to know

01:06:46.774 --> 01:06:53.358
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen

01:06:53.532 --> 01:06:59.653
To hear sleighbells in the snow

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:06.200
l'm dreaming of a white Christmas

01:07:06.379 --> 01:07:11.255
With every Christmas card l write

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:18.308
May your days be merry and bright

01:07:18.476 --> 01:07:26.389
And may all your Christmases
Be white

01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:28.063
Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:07:28.237 --> 01:07:31.820
Merry Christmas!
