WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.541
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.625 --> 00:10.750
Listen.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.333
What do you think?

00:12.416 --> 00:15.666
Could my ascendant sign be Scorpio?

00:15.750 --> 00:18.208
It doesn't work like that.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.166
No?

00:22.000 --> 00:28.208
AN ASTROLOGICAL GUIDE FOR BROKEN HEARTS

00:28.458 --> 00:32.000
GEMINI

00:38.750 --> 00:39.916
-Alice?
-Yes?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.833
Is this okay, what do you think?

00:42.583 --> 00:44.458
Let's see some other options.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.833
-Have you seen Enrico?
-No.

00:51.916 --> 00:53.291
He's not in his office.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.500
While you're here,

00:54.583 --> 00:57.333
how do I calculate
my ascendant sign in winter?

00:58.041 --> 00:59.666
Do I subtract an hour?

01:00.666 --> 01:02.125
I have no clue.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.500
What do you mean?

01:03.583 --> 01:06.000
You came up with a show about astrology.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.541
Ask Tio.

01:09.416 --> 01:10.500
Will she wear that?

01:10.583 --> 01:13.916
I'm Capricorn with ascendant Taurus.
You can count on me.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.250
Don't you worry.

01:23.041 --> 01:23.958
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:24.458 --> 01:25.583
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:29.000 --> 01:30.916
Mara, have you seen Enrico?

01:31.000 --> 01:31.875
No.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.000
Alice?

01:36.916 --> 01:37.791
So?

01:38.791 --> 01:41.166
-How is it going?
-Everything is under control.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.875
The sets are ready.

01:42.958 --> 01:45.250
Marlin is on make-up.
Tio is with the contestants.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.875
I'm about to join Carlo
in the control room.

01:49.666 --> 01:51.583
Is Enrico helping you out?

01:51.666 --> 01:52.500
Of course.

01:53.708 --> 01:54.791
And where is he?

01:54.875 --> 01:56.041
Around.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.708
I put myself on the line with Bodrato.

01:59.791 --> 02:01.416
Should anything go wrong--

02:01.500 --> 02:02.583
It won't happen.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.291
That's what I'm expecting.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.208
Starting positions.

02:31.291 --> 02:33.500
Let's do a sound check.

02:33.583 --> 02:35.875
Then opening and closing theme music.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.458
Here I am.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.208
-Sergio?
<i>-Yes, Carlo.</i>

02:40.291 --> 02:43.125
Can you check that all doors are clear?

02:43.208 --> 02:44.583
<i>Sure. Any problems?</i>

02:44.666 --> 02:47.625
The last thing we need
is that someone in the crowd

02:47.708 --> 02:49.166
ends up being trampled.

02:49.791 --> 02:51.833
And I thought I was nervous.

02:51.916 --> 02:53.625
I checked all the doors.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.125
Breathe.

02:56.833 --> 02:57.708
It'll be fine.

03:00.041 --> 03:00.875
Come with me.

03:01.750 --> 03:02.625
Okay.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.375
Do you know why it won't work?

03:08.458 --> 03:09.291
Why?

03:10.166 --> 03:12.791
Because there are so many issues
in this show.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.166
I know.

03:14.708 --> 03:15.750
It's normal.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.458
It's just a pilot.

03:17.541 --> 03:19.083
No, it's not normal. No.

03:20.083 --> 03:23.333
If you'd taken the trouble to involve me

03:23.416 --> 03:26.000
when you were playing writer with Sardi,

03:26.083 --> 03:27.208
then maybe

03:27.708 --> 03:29.500
we could've had a chance.

03:30.625 --> 03:32.208
But you only remember me

03:32.958 --> 03:34.166
when it suits you.

03:35.416 --> 03:39.166
And now I have to patch up
your ridiculous idea.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.375
-Actually I--
-Listen.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.750
Just make sure
the contestants know what to say.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.583
And stay out of the control room.

03:51.000 --> 03:51.833
Boo!

03:53.250 --> 03:54.125
Hey.

03:54.791 --> 03:56.041
Opening night nerves?

03:56.541 --> 03:57.375
No.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.333
I mean a little.

04:01.083 --> 04:01.958
Carlo.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.583
He always makes me feel so small.

04:04.666 --> 04:05.500
Look at me.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.708
Screw Carlo.

04:07.791 --> 04:08.708
Okay?

04:08.791 --> 04:10.833
He's nervous. We all are.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.583
-Break a leg.
-You too.

04:27.458 --> 04:28.833
Fuck, Enrico.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.375
What the hell!

04:34.458 --> 04:36.750
If you wake him, I'll kill myself.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.833
What is Riccardino doing here?

04:45.083 --> 04:46.291
Are you crazy, Enrico?

04:47.750 --> 04:48.875
I had no choice.

04:48.958 --> 04:50.875
Couldn't he stay home with Elvira?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.291
She's not home.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.166
And where is she?

04:54.958 --> 04:55.791
I don't know.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.916
She says she needs space.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.000
ENRICO CRIPPA
PRODUCTION DIRECTOR

05:00.083 --> 05:00.958
Where are you?

05:02.958 --> 05:04.166
You can't come up, Elvira.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.458
It's fine. I'll come down.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.625
Riccardo is asleep. He's staying here.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.208
No, just wait downstairs.

05:11.291 --> 05:12.333
You wanted space?

05:12.416 --> 05:13.875
There's lots of space outside.

05:13.958 --> 05:14.791
Bye.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.416
I'll go talk to her,
please keep an eye on Riccardo.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.833
No, Enrico.

05:19.916 --> 05:21.000
We're about to shoot.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.375
-We need you in the control room.
-Fuck.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.166
Sardi has noticed that--

05:28.375 --> 05:29.208
Here we go.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.291
This thing. Here we go.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.375
Take this.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.291
He won't wake up. We were up all night.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.541
-But--
-She can't come up.

05:41.916 --> 05:42.750
Be quick.

05:43.416 --> 05:44.250
Thanks.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.791
<i>Okay, all good.</i>

05:50.875 --> 05:52.708
<i>We're ready.</i>

05:52.791 --> 05:53.875
<i>Olmo, stay on it.</i>

05:55.208 --> 05:59.375
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

05:59.875 --> 06:00.833
<i>Theme song.</i>

06:04.250 --> 06:05.166
Camera one.

06:17.916 --> 06:20.750
To quote Shakespeare, "It is the stars."

06:20.833 --> 06:25.250
"The stars above us
govern our conditions."

06:25.333 --> 06:26.375
Stay on Marlin.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.333
<i>-Ladies and gentlemen…</i>
-Go.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.208
Welcome to the first episode
of <i>Stars of Love.</i>

06:33.291 --> 06:35.875
The first and only game show

06:35.958 --> 06:39.666
that looks to the stars
in order to give contestants

06:40.333 --> 06:41.833
the most precious gift.

06:42.916 --> 06:43.750
Love.

06:44.625 --> 06:47.625
Camera two on Tio
and move to the contestants on three.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.750
There's not enough light.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.750
Who dimmed the lights?

06:52.333 --> 06:54.458
-More light.
-No, Carlo. It was my idea.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.125
It's too dark and mysterious.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.291
That's how I want it.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.125
Okay, let's move on.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.958
A lonely heart…

07:01.041 --> 07:02.333
A lonely heart

07:02.416 --> 07:05.041
will have to choose among 12 suitors.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.833
One for each star sign.

07:08.833 --> 07:09.666
Excuse me.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.791
What's that noise?

07:11.875 --> 07:14.000
We can't hear a thing.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.333
What sort of noise?

07:18.791 --> 07:19.708
What is it?

07:21.583 --> 07:22.916
It's all good, let's move on.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.625
And we have a true astrology guru

07:26.708 --> 07:28.541
to help our lonely heart.

07:28.625 --> 07:30.041
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:30.750 --> 07:31.625
Tio!

07:43.333 --> 07:44.541
Did you say something?

07:46.458 --> 07:48.083
Stop mumbling, I can't hear.

07:49.791 --> 07:50.875
God dammit!

07:50.958 --> 07:52.083
Alice, what's going on?

07:53.041 --> 07:54.916
Sorry about this.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.166
Stop filming.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.500
I need 15 minutes for myself.

07:58.583 --> 07:59.583
I'm sorry.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.000
Stop!

08:04.416 --> 08:06.125
Enrico, where are you?

08:07.166 --> 08:08.666
Riccardino is awake.

08:09.916 --> 08:10.791
Call me!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.041
Where is my dad?

08:13.125 --> 08:14.416
He's coming.

08:15.083 --> 08:15.916
Sweetheart.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.458
Did you just wake up?

08:17.541 --> 08:20.125
<i>As we're on a break, can we please try it</i>

08:20.208 --> 08:21.666
with more light?

08:21.750 --> 08:23.958
Carlo, I can hear you.
Don't change the lights.

08:24.041 --> 08:25.333
<i>Where are you?</i>

08:25.416 --> 08:26.541
Olmo.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.000
Give me the headset.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.000
<i>Alice, it's Davide.</i>

08:30.083 --> 08:31.500
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

08:31.583 --> 08:33.875
<i>-Everything is fine.</i>
<i>-</i>What's going on?

08:33.958 --> 08:35.875
Nothing, women's…

08:36.791 --> 08:37.625
things.

08:38.916 --> 08:40.625
Give me a minute.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.875
Thank you.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.000
Well?

08:44.083 --> 08:45.333
Why have we stopped?

08:47.208 --> 08:48.041
You know…

08:48.958 --> 08:49.916
personal things.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.291
Just stay here,

08:52.375 --> 08:53.291
nice and quiet.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.291
Draw something for Daddy.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.125
What do you want to do?

08:58.208 --> 08:59.333
I need to poo.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.333
I hope so.

09:10.666 --> 09:11.625
Finished.

09:14.541 --> 09:15.500
Can you help me?

09:20.166 --> 09:21.500
Can't you do it yourself?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.041
<i>Enrico, I will kill you.</i>

09:26.125 --> 09:29.041
Now let's watch a movie.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.750
A long one.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.458
<i>Move to camera two.</i>

09:33.791 --> 09:34.875
<i>Mara?</i>

09:34.958 --> 09:36.208
<i>Go to a wide shot.</i>

09:36.791 --> 09:37.666
I'm coming.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.041
<i>No rush.</i>

09:39.541 --> 09:40.666
<i>We're shooting again.</i>

09:41.416 --> 09:42.250
What?

09:42.833 --> 09:44.583
Dear Marlin,

09:44.666 --> 09:46.208
it's very easy.

09:46.291 --> 09:50.458
Our contestant will be able
to observe from the start

09:50.541 --> 09:53.375
all of our handsome, competing suitors.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.791
You could have waited 15 minutes.

09:55.875 --> 09:59.625
<i>First impressions matter, but then again.</i>

09:59.708 --> 10:00.958
I'm sorry, Alice.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.625
<i>-Let's move on.</i>
-The stars come into play.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.666
I will guide her

10:05.750 --> 10:08.041
to discover the characteristics

10:08.125 --> 10:11.250
of the star signs in front of her.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.083
And then we'll see

10:13.833 --> 10:16.916
if first impressions are confirmed

10:17.000 --> 10:19.208
or contradicted

10:19.708 --> 10:20.583
by the stars.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.875
Well said, Tio. Well said.

10:23.958 --> 10:26.750
Well, the time has come

10:26.833 --> 10:29.125
to introduce our lonely heart.

10:29.708 --> 10:30.958
Her name is Simona.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.625
She is 30 years old

10:32.708 --> 10:35.375
from Ivrea and her sign is

10:35.458 --> 10:36.791
Sagittarius!

10:36.875 --> 10:39.083
Let's give her a round of applause!

10:43.500 --> 10:45.083
Sergio, give me a close up.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.375
-Welcome, Simona.
-Welcome.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.333
Welcome.

10:48.416 --> 10:51.541
Put your hands together
for these two beautiful ladies.

10:52.833 --> 10:53.666
Simona.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.583
My dear Marlin,

10:55.666 --> 10:57.125
Simona is a Sagittarius

10:57.208 --> 10:59.208
with Gemini ascendant.

10:59.708 --> 11:03.916
I've already prepared her astral chart.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.875
<i>-Have you?</i>
-Sergio, pan out.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.333
I'm always ready.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.333
Here we go. So,

11:10.416 --> 11:11.833
let's cut to the chase.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.125
Simona, what do you look for in a man?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.375
Well, he must be faithful.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.375
And he must be charming.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.375
Charming.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.916
We have plenty of charm here.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.291
Congratulations, guys.

11:26.375 --> 11:29.500
Now I would like to discover with you

11:29.583 --> 11:31.750
their zodiacal characteristics.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.166
Marlin, if I may,

11:34.250 --> 11:36.458
I'm going to steal our Simona

11:36.541 --> 11:40.250
and I will go over to discover Capricorn.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.166
Let's go.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.750
A round of applause for our Capricorn!

11:44.833 --> 11:47.791
His name is Stefano.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.458
Capricorn men tend to be…

11:51.541 --> 11:52.625
No, it can't be.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.208
What's up, Alice?

11:54.875 --> 11:57.291
-As you can see, Simona…
-Nothing. All good.

11:58.083 --> 11:58.916
<i>Keep rolling.</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:01.708
He can be really funny.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.416
Let's play the clip.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.250
Camera one.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.500
We're onto the videos.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.458
Camera three.

12:10.541 --> 12:11.416
Good.

12:12.125 --> 12:13.291
Go.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.625
<i>Stefano, 32. Capricorn.</i>

12:15.708 --> 12:16.916
<i>My sign is a bit weird.</i>

12:17.000 --> 12:20.166
<i>Half goat, half sea creature.</i>
<i>Some might think</i>

12:20.250 --> 12:22.625
<i>-I'm neither fish nor fowl.</i>
-Riccardino!

12:22.708 --> 12:24.791
<i>But I say I'm both.</i>

12:24.875 --> 12:26.375
<i>Basically, I'm like paella.</i>

12:28.166 --> 12:30.833
A round of applause for Stefano,
really funny.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.208
<i>What's your </i>name?

12:32.291 --> 12:33.125
Riccardino.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.291
Riccardino?<i> Come here, Riccardino.</i>

12:37.250 --> 12:38.750
<i>What a lovely name.</i>

12:39.750 --> 12:40.666
<i>Are you alright?</i>

12:42.208 --> 12:45.416
If I'm not mistaken, Stefano too…

12:45.500 --> 12:46.625
Yes, thank you.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.416
Thanks so much.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.583
Is he your son?

12:49.666 --> 12:50.500
No.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.750
I can't thank you enough.

12:52.833 --> 12:53.750
Come on.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.916
<i>-Bye.</i>
<i>-Bye.</i>

12:59.750 --> 13:00.958
Get back to work.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.208
Or I'll have to fire you.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.833
Go!

13:18.791 --> 13:19.875
Go to a close-up.

13:21.416 --> 13:23.250
<i>A courtship master.</i>

13:24.041 --> 13:25.166
<i>An energetic lover.</i>

13:26.041 --> 13:27.416
<i>A predator…</i>

13:27.500 --> 13:30.208
I love the videos, great idea.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.375
<i>This is my sign, Aries.</i>

13:32.458 --> 13:35.000
<i>I'm Francesco, I'm 27 years old</i>

13:35.083 --> 13:39.083
<i>and sometimes I wonder</i>
<i>whether I was born on the wrong day.</i>

13:41.166 --> 13:42.333
Should we do it again?

13:43.166 --> 13:45.083
No, Alice is doing well.

13:45.916 --> 13:47.750
It makes you want to apply, no?

13:50.750 --> 13:54.125
Shall I go grab you a snack
from the vending machine?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.083
Alice.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.000
<i>Fuck me.</i>

13:56.958 --> 13:57.916
Who's the kid?

13:58.958 --> 13:59.875
Hi.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.375
I can't explain right now.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.041
I think you should.

14:10.791 --> 14:11.916
Come with me.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.833
It all happened so suddenly.

14:18.916 --> 14:20.666
There was no time to think.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.541
Anyway, it's all my fault.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.625
I wanted to help Enrico.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.875
You should have told me.

14:30.958 --> 14:31.875
I know.

14:32.666 --> 14:35.000
I didn't want to get him into trouble.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.166
We've wasted enough time.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.791
Return to set. I'll look after him.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.041
Are you sure?

14:43.833 --> 14:45.083
Go.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.041
Well?

14:55.875 --> 14:57.375
You little rascal.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.000
Go on, scoot.

15:00.791 --> 15:01.666
Thank you.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.750
I miss my mom and dad.

15:07.041 --> 15:07.875
I know.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.750
Let's find a way to distract us
from how much we miss them.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.458
How do you do that?

15:15.416 --> 15:17.208
Well, it's different for me.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.541
I'm a grown-up.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.583
Do grown-ups not miss people?

15:23.625 --> 15:25.375
Of course, we do.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.208
We're just better at pretending we don't.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.125
Wear this.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.666
Perfect.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.333
Now you're a pirate.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.708
And we're sailing the stormy seas.

15:47.791 --> 15:49.416
The waves are huge.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.250
There's wind, and thunder, and lightning.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.625
Our mission is

15:54.166 --> 15:56.625
to find Mom and Dad and get them home.

15:56.708 --> 15:57.541
Yes!

15:57.625 --> 15:58.875
Dear Simona,

15:59.625 --> 16:01.541
the choice is yours.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.083
Our Tio guided you here,

16:04.166 --> 16:08.875
but now your destiny
is in your hands only.

16:10.416 --> 16:12.333
Who's going to be the lucky one?

16:13.791 --> 16:15.000
The lovable Cancer?

16:15.083 --> 16:16.458
CANCER

16:16.541 --> 16:18.208
The trusting Capricorn?

16:18.958 --> 16:20.958
Or the charming Pisces?

16:22.666 --> 16:24.458
The romantic Pisces.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.541
PISCES

16:27.166 --> 16:28.041
Simona,

16:28.125 --> 16:30.583
you have 30 seconds to choose.

16:30.666 --> 16:33.291
<i>Incredible,</i>
<i>we've almost finished the pilot.</i>

16:33.375 --> 16:34.291
<i>Come on.</i>

16:34.375 --> 16:37.041
Especially thanks
to your positive attitude.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.916
Your time is up!

16:57.000 --> 16:57.833
Simona,

16:59.208 --> 17:00.958
are you ready to tell us

17:01.583 --> 17:03.666
which star sign

17:04.250 --> 17:06.375
you feel more in tune with?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.416
-Yes.
-Say it to the camera.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.333
Yes.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.583
I've chosen…

17:12.750 --> 17:15.416
Darling, you're wonderful!

17:15.500 --> 17:18.291
-You were great.
-You too, really.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.458
It's such a great idea!

17:20.541 --> 17:21.625
Well done, darling.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.000
-We did it.
-Time to celebrate!

17:25.541 --> 17:26.416
Alice?

17:26.500 --> 17:27.958
-Come, come!
-Thank you.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.666
-Thanks.
-Alice?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.958
Where is Riccardo?

17:33.666 --> 17:35.041
He's with Sardi.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.875
With Sardi? Why?

17:37.833 --> 17:39.000
He woke up.

17:39.666 --> 17:41.875
I called you a million times, Enrico.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.000
I know.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.458
It's been crazy. I'll tell you later.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.208
-To Alice!
-To Alice!

17:49.291 --> 17:51.916
To Alice!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.875
-Where is Alice?
-Alice?

17:53.958 --> 17:56.083
-Ready?
-Here she comes.

18:00.125 --> 18:02.125
-Alice Bassi!
-Stop it!

18:02.708 --> 18:04.125
This is so embarrassing!

18:04.750 --> 18:06.333
Well done, you did great.

18:09.750 --> 18:10.583
Alice Bassi,

18:11.958 --> 18:14.583
how are you going to celebrate
tonight's success?

18:15.625 --> 18:16.458
No idea.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.333
My last success was coming in third

18:21.416 --> 18:22.958
in a swimming competition

18:23.041 --> 18:26.416
when I was 12 years old.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.208
He could definitely help you celebrate.

18:38.791 --> 18:41.541
His name is Alejandro.
He's from Argentina.

18:42.125 --> 18:43.375
And he's a Gemini.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.583
Let's be honest.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.541
Geminis

18:49.625 --> 18:52.041
single-handedly support psychotherapists.

18:53.250 --> 18:57.458
Geminis have so many
different personalities within them

18:57.541 --> 19:00.791
that they make regular appointments
to discuss their issues.

19:01.416 --> 19:04.250
And they live in chaos

19:04.875 --> 19:08.291
and are incapable of having just one idea,

19:08.375 --> 19:09.833
just one opinion,

19:09.916 --> 19:11.500
and, truth be told,

19:11.583 --> 19:13.958
just one woman or one man.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.416
What they say today

19:17.291 --> 19:21.083
may not be consistent
with their actions tomorrow.

19:21.875 --> 19:22.708
Therefore,

19:23.416 --> 19:26.041
if a Gemini remembers
to take you to the movies

19:26.125 --> 19:28.541
two whole days after asking you out,

19:30.375 --> 19:33.291
he must be really serious about you.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.375
Hold on, how do you know he's a Gemini?

19:40.250 --> 19:41.500
Please don't tell me--

19:41.583 --> 19:43.333
No way. Never.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.541
Geminis are toxic to me.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.458
And to you, actually.

19:48.666 --> 19:50.833
<i>But for a night of Latin passion…</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:54.916
That is, if you remember what passion is.

19:55.916 --> 19:56.791
Vaguely.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.416
I thought I was the only one

20:16.750 --> 20:18.958
who didn't want to go home.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.541
Sorry I ruined your big moment.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.041
I forgive you.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.916
Thank you for looking after Riccardino.

20:30.666 --> 20:31.958
It's all sorted.

20:32.041 --> 20:32.875
Never again.

20:32.958 --> 20:33.833
Never again.

20:36.208 --> 20:37.541
Bodrato was thrilled.

20:39.916 --> 20:41.291
You did a great job.

20:45.750 --> 20:46.625
One more thing.

20:47.958 --> 20:50.208
I heard you talking to Riccardino.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.250
You were…

20:55.375 --> 20:56.250
very sweet.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.125
See you tomorrow.

21:26.708 --> 21:27.541
<i>Hello.</i>

21:28.750 --> 21:29.583
Hi.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.916
I thought maybe you fancied a drink

21:36.000 --> 21:36.875
<i>to celebrate.</i>

21:38.916 --> 21:40.250
What a sweet thought.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.166
Isn't it?

21:43.666 --> 21:46.666
I'm not drinking for a while,
I promised my friend Paola.

21:47.666 --> 21:48.500
What a shame.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.041
<i>In the end, you do deserve a reward.</i>

22:32.416 --> 22:33.958
-No.
-Yes.

22:34.041 --> 22:34.916
Stop.

22:47.625 --> 22:49.125
<i>That turns me on.</i>

23:22.083 --> 23:23.541
Are you alright, <i>chiquitita</i>?

23:24.125 --> 23:24.958
Sure.

23:43.541 --> 23:44.916
<i>More than a reward,</i>

23:45.000 --> 23:47.250
<i>I got a participation certificate.</i>

24:07.833 --> 24:09.291
GOOD MORNING, CHIQUITITA.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.541
I REALLY HOPE
YOU'LL SEE ME AGAIN

24:27.000 --> 24:27.875
Paola,

24:27.958 --> 24:31.375
do you remember Banderas when he was young

24:31.458 --> 24:33.333
in the Almodóvar movies

24:33.416 --> 24:36.208
before Melanie Griffith sucked him dry?

24:37.666 --> 24:39.500
Did you get my photo?

24:39.583 --> 24:42.750
He woke up at 7:00 a.m.
to prepare a big breakfast.

24:43.791 --> 24:46.708
First the show, then Alejandro.

24:48.541 --> 24:50.791
There's something in the air, today.

24:51.958 --> 24:55.000
I can't remember the last time
I was looking forward to work.

24:57.333 --> 24:58.666
I'll call you later.

25:00.625 --> 25:01.458
Kisses.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.125
We can fix this.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.708
I just can't… believe it.

25:14.791 --> 25:15.916
Good morning!

25:16.500 --> 25:17.625
Why the long faces?

25:18.500 --> 25:19.833
Did someone's cat die?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.416
Enrico was fired.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.083
Apparently, he wasn't needed anymore

25:28.833 --> 25:30.958
now that we have a new star in town.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
