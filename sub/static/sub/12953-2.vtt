00:57.257 --> 01:00.988
I'm guessing this isn't a personal visit.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.359
No.

01:04.596 --> 01:07.225
Roman Vadik.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.302
We need your help.

01:13.106 --> 01:16.075
- Nadia, I need you to come back with me.
- No.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.408
Sydney...

01:25.685 --> 01:27.880
He was a good friend.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.548
Worked with me.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.716
Vadik killed him.

01:34.794 --> 01:36.853
Had his...

01:36.930 --> 01:39.831
head shipped back to our office.

01:44.237 --> 01:47.035
But I'll give you what I have.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.668
No one deals with Vadik directly.
Everything goes through his lieutenant.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.643
- You wanna write this down?
- No, I got it.

01:52.712 --> 01:56.978
Kazu Tomazaki.
Considers himself a modern samurai.

01:57.050 --> 02:02.044
Arrested five years ago trying to rob
the Hazunaga Asian Museum in London.

02:02.122 --> 02:06.684
Escaped from police custody - among
the least of the charges against him.

02:06.759 --> 02:07.783
I hope that helps.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.989
Men like Vadik, like Tomazaki,
they need to be eliminated.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.964
I can't.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.132
I can't.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.633
You do understand?

02:39.893 --> 02:43.590
- I made penne. There was...
- This cannot continue.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.690
A crucial assumption of our operational
competence is communication.

02:47.767 --> 02:51.897
Sydney, if we don't have that,
every mission, the life of every operative,

02:51.971 --> 02:53.563
- could be at risk.
- I'm doing my job.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.200
No. What you need to do
is find a way to accept what's happened.

02:56.276 --> 02:57.834
If you can deal with Arvin Sloane...

02:57.911 --> 03:01.074
I love that you knew that,
that you approved it.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.307
It may be hard for you to accept

03:02.382 --> 03:04.782
that your father doesn't have the authority
to make all the decisions...

03:04.851 --> 03:10.255
No, what's hard for me to accept
are the decisions that you do make.

03:10.323 --> 03:15.590
What's hard is looking at you, walking
past you, smelling that sickening cologne.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.324
And what's...
what's hard is being your daughter

03:18.398 --> 03:22.129
and not being able to separate myself
as far as I may get

03:22.202 --> 03:24.932
from the person I despise the most.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.701
You went to see Nadia.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.441
Did you tell her what you know?

03:49.662 --> 03:52.028
I guess I thought

03:52.098 --> 03:54.931
that maybe you'd come here...

03:55.001 --> 03:59.301
I don't know,
to give me something, information.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.307
Something that would help make sense
of what I was afraid you'd become.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.105
But there's nothing you could say.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.973
Of course
you were only looking out for yourself.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.042
Is that what you think of me
as an operative?

04:15.121 --> 04:18.022
That I would reveal your secret?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.752
That poor girl.

04:24.464 --> 04:27.126
I didn't tell Nadia a thing.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.782
Sorry.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.191
What's going on?

05:01.267 --> 05:03.667
It was Lauren who told me.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.235
What?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.867
Told me where to look.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.804
The safety deposit box in Wittenberg.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.481
How she knew, I don't know.

05:24.557 --> 05:29.017
I wasn't even gonna go. I had no reason
to believe anything that woman said.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.927
But the curiosity was just too strong.

05:39.906 --> 05:44.309
I got there,
and inside the box there was a file.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.871
Classified, highest level.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.854
My heart was pounding.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.122
Like I knew somehow before I knew.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.090
What was it?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.131
Evidence.

06:11.170 --> 06:16.267
Evidence that my mother had been
a security risk, which wasn't really news.

06:16.342 --> 06:20.335
It mentioned her history with the KGB,
everything we knew.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.951
Then there was a page.

06:29.956 --> 06:33.016
An official request made by my father...

06:34.293 --> 06:38.491
asking for the authority
to execute Irina Derevko.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.659
A request that was granted.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.203
And he did it.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.567
He killed her.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.983
He killed my mother.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.324
He did it, Vaughn.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.456
He killed her.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.021
He killed my mother.

07:55.274 --> 07:58.300
Two weeks ago,
the man on the train, Kazu Tomazaki,

07:58.377 --> 08:02.177
severed ties with all known contacts,
eliminated all means of communication.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.239
- Any idea where he's gone or why?
- Nothing.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.945
Our one link to Roman Vadik
has disappeared.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.146
Any indication
Vadik turned on Tomazaki?

08:09.222 --> 08:11.782
All chatter says
that Vadik is status quo.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.918
- So Tomazaki is still all we've got?
- All we had. He's gone.

08:14.994 --> 08:19.761
Back to what we know.
The Hazunaga Asian Museum in London.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.665
Nadia said he was arrested
five years ago. Break-in.

08:22.735 --> 08:23.793
Was there a motive?

08:23.870 --> 08:26.964
He was caught
in the Shintaro sword exhibit.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.667
The shootout killed two MPs
and one of his own men.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.371
- What was he doing?
- Trying to steal the Shintaro sword,

08:33.446 --> 08:36.279
the most famous samurai sword
outside of Japan,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.840
wanting to restore honor
to the blade and to his country.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.044
You gotta be kidding me.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.280
We may not have the means
to contact Tomazaki,

08:42.355 --> 08:46.724
but I can see a way
to get Tomazaki to contact us.

08:46.792 --> 08:51.195
Are you suggesting
we fake a robbery of the Hazunaga?

08:55.434 --> 08:58.267
You think we should steal the sword?

08:58.337 --> 09:00.965
That museum's
one of the world's most secure.

09:01.040 --> 09:07.036
If this were my operation, there's only
one man I'd trust to get us in there.

09:12.451 --> 09:16.012
- Are you as depressed as I am?
- Depressed about what?

09:16.088 --> 09:20.184
Depressed about what? Take a look
around here. This place is a ghost town.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.853
I don't even know anybody here anymore.

09:26.299 --> 09:31.168
Sydney is gone. Dixon, Jack, Vaughn.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.933
The only guy we have left is Sark,
and that's only because he's in custody.

09:34.006 --> 09:38.102
I hate that guy. He really kinda scare...
Although I did go visit him twice.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.236
Just to see a familiar face.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.312
We had eggs.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.679
Don't do that.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.723
Marshall Flinkman, you're under arrest
for the misuse of government assets.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.231
Misuse? What?
What did I misuse?

10:00.299 --> 10:03.359
Unauthorized computer equipment
may be connected to your monitors...

10:03.436 --> 10:06.064
I don't understand.
What did I have connected?

10:06.138 --> 10:07.833
Is this yours?

10:10.276 --> 10:11.766
It was for a mission.
I swear.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.607
I just wanted to download
some maps from Conquerquest.

10:13.679 --> 10:17.171
I heard they were really good.
Of course, CIA maps are much better.

10:23.255 --> 10:27.021
- Am I dead?
- You've been recruited.

10:27.093 --> 10:32.656
We're a black-ops division, Marshall.
You're going to head up technology.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.200
Syd...

10:39.271 --> 10:41.501
Sloane is here.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.599
We know.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.441
OK.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.843
Syd!

10:49.915 --> 10:51.542
We're back.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.833
Merlin to team.
Great. Way to go, guys.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.738
- Stay focused.
- They're focused.

11:25.284 --> 11:28.685
OK. Shotgun to Merlin,
tapping into surveillance.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.791
OK, I can see it.
The Shintaro sword.

11:48.474 --> 11:52.205
It's a Studler Matrix system.
What am I looking for?

11:52.278 --> 11:54.974
OK. Studler Matrix.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.810
What fuse?

11:56.882 --> 11:59.407
- L7.
- Copy that. Looping L7.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.043
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.315
That would be bad.
Don't do that.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.553
You need to reroute through E3.

12:09.862 --> 12:12.228
- E3 rerouted.
- OK. Go to L7.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.698
Copy that. Looping L7.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.596
OK, the security feed's looped.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.646
Outrigger, something fell down the vent.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.614
- Cooney to Control.
- Right, Cooney.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.453
Check floor two, would you?
I think I heard something.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.426
No, it's all clear.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.587
You're still good.

12:50.336 --> 12:53.464
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.806
How cool is this?
Stealing a sword so we can find a bad guy,

13:01.881 --> 13:04.111
in order to catch
an even bigger bad guy.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.118
Come on. Come on. You would never
let us do this back in the CIA...

13:07.186 --> 13:11.919
You know, when you were
double-breasted, serious robot-Dixon.

13:11.991 --> 13:15.688
I mean, not that you...
You were just... authoritative.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.962
I'm sorry.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.899
Outrigger to base.
ETA 90 seconds.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.463
Security camera's on loop.
So far so good.

14:46.485 --> 14:49.477
Biggest challenge?
Hands down...

14:49.555 --> 14:51.955
is that pressure pad on the case.

14:52.858 --> 14:58.728
You know, the marble border? There's
no way to deactivate it. Supercalibrated.

15:16.282 --> 15:21.185
Phoenix, you've got company.
Tango headed your way. ETA 20 seconds.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.280
- Phoenix, abort! Repeat: Abort.
- I'm almost there.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.388
Phoenix, he's coming.
Get out of there now.

15:30.462 --> 15:31.622
Almost there.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.096
Dammit!

16:28.020 --> 16:30.614
Phoenix to base, I'm in the east alley.
I need an extraction now.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.748
We're at a secondary route.
We're 60 seconds out.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.886
I don't have 60 seconds.
I'll meet you at the LZ. I'm going.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.646
Sydney, get in.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.706
Get in now.
You can be stubborn later.

16:58.784 --> 16:59.842
Outrigger, this is Raptor.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.079
- I have Phoenix. Heading to rendezvous.
- What are you doing here?

17:02.154 --> 17:05.385
You know what else typically works in
a situation like this? A simple "thank you. "

17:05.457 --> 17:06.753
Get down.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.075
You didn't tell her, did you?
The truth.

17:31.483 --> 17:35.920
I told her that I was responsible
for the death of her mother.

17:35.988 --> 17:41.620
- Did you tell her everything?
- She's better off not knowing everything.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.152
Tough call, Jack.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.592
Better that she detests me.

17:48.667 --> 17:52.364
I fear the alternative
would have left her incapacitated.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.345
I assume
you have something to sell?

18:03.415 --> 18:06.145
I have the Shintaro sword.

18:09.221 --> 18:12.384
Herr Vogel,
you never cease to astound me.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.622
An inside job, no doubt, yes?

18:16.695 --> 18:18.629
No matter.

18:18.697 --> 18:21.393
People on the street are impressed.
An incredible job.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.197
My friends are good at what they do.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.794
Let me make a few calls.

18:28.807 --> 18:32.243
- It's done.
- Good work. Head home.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.371
Dixon set the sword in play.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.780
You can expect
to hear from Tomazaki within hours.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.080
It's good, isn't it...

18:44.156 --> 18:46.454
having the team back together again?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.265
Anything?

18:58.337 --> 19:00.737
Well, mostly what we already know.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.798
Roman Vadik is some serious bad news.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.844
Check this out.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.445
Pakistan, 500 casualties.

19:10.082 --> 19:14.644
Prime minister of Kafiristan
assassinated in broad daylight.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.815
- Who's that?
- It's Pablo Martinez.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.792
He's an Argentinean agent.
He was investigating Vadik last year.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.125
He was caught.
Vadik had him killed.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.657
- Martinez was partners with Nadia Santos.
- Your sister?

19:29.735 --> 19:31.726
Half sister.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.338
Well, he was the only one
who ever saw Vadik alive.

19:35.407 --> 19:37.637
I mean, at least on ourside.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.200
He wasn't transmitting, was he,
when he was captured?

19:50.689 --> 19:55.888
I'll make you a deal.
You cooperate with us. That's it.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.861
You don't frighten me.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.831
Then clearly you're an idiot.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.800
The man you were working for
on the train - Tomazaki -

20:03.869 --> 20:07.168
he referred to his boss, Mr. Vadik.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.901
But we ran voiceprints.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.777
An agent was killed last year by Vadik,

20:13.845 --> 20:16.541
but his voice... you know, the killer...

20:16.615 --> 20:18.708
it matches perfectly
with the man on the train.

20:18.784 --> 20:23.244
Tomazaki. Which means Vadik
trusts Tomazaki enough to front for him

20:23.322 --> 20:25.187
and act on his behalf.

20:25.257 --> 20:30.854
Simple deduction says that,
if Tomazaki trusts you, you've seen Vadik.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.904
Where do we find Vadik?

20:45.410 --> 20:48.846
I'll need protective services for this.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.781
You help us and you have my word.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.617
Vadik.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.060
You are at him.

21:05.697 --> 21:08.029
Vadik is Tomazaki.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.900
There is no Vadik.
It's a cover.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.964
He made him up.
There's no Vadik.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.074
Vadik doesn't exist at all.

21:21.146 --> 21:25.276
If it's actually Tomazaki who's in charge,
we need a new game plan.

21:26.518 --> 21:28.986
- Yes?
- Tomazaki took the bait.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.784
We're set for a Wednesday meet
in Rio de Janeiro.

21:31.857 --> 21:35.315
He insists that the woman
who stole the sword make the delivery.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.760
Apparently he has access to police files.
He was intrigued.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.093
- What about backup?
- She's allowed one addition.

21:40.165 --> 21:44.192
Jack, you escort Sydney with the sword.
Vaughn, Marshall, you'll support Dixon.

21:44.269 --> 21:46.931
- I want a plan by 1800.
- Excuse me.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.767
I prefer Dixon as my partner.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.469
I'm sure you're aware
of our experience together in the field.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.876
That shorthand could be important.

21:54.946 --> 21:57.437
I've already made my assignments.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.395
You good?

22:16.468 --> 22:19.665
As soon as Tomazaki makes contact,
we'll ID and take out any backup he's got.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.901
Then we'll move in,
grab him, get on a plane.

22:27.245 --> 22:30.112
- Team's in position, mics are hot.
- We've got full visual.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.175
- Phoenix, Raptor, it's your show.
- Copy that, Outrigger.

22:41.226 --> 22:45.219
This is the best conversation
we've had in weeks.

22:53.605 --> 22:56.369
Merlin, patch this call through my earpiece
to the rest of the team.

22:56.441 --> 22:59.899
OK, Phoenix, you are hot.
And I mean that in many ways.

22:59.978 --> 23:01.878
Shotgun, you're in on the call.

23:05.617 --> 23:08.950
Look across the square.
You'll see a tunnel.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.580
It will take you to the belly
of the Alves building. Go to the tenth floor.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.752
No backup, no guns.
Just the sword.

23:16.828 --> 23:20.127
- Meet me in three minutes or it's off.
- Merlin, the Alves building.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.564
Listen, this building
was converted into a bank last year.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.226
Shotgun, you're gonna
have to look the part.

23:24.302 --> 23:27.100
OK, we've got wardrobe.
Let's do it.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.977
I'm going in - alone.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.480
I assume you all heard that.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.448
Starting through the tunnel.

23:47.692 --> 23:49.717
Phoenix, meet me
at the elevators before you go up.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.786
See you at the elevator.

23:54.499 --> 23:58.230
OK, now, that tunnel was reinforced
after the earthquake of '44.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.998
We're probably
gonna lose comms until...

24:16.455 --> 24:21.825
Shotgun, we've temporarily
lost contact with Phoenix.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.293
Merlin, tell me
there's a tenth floor in this building.

24:33.672 --> 24:34.661
Guys...

25:51.850 --> 25:54.842
Hello, Sydney Bristow.

26:37.395 --> 26:40.728
If Tomazaki wanted to kill
Sydney, we're already too late.

26:41.199 --> 26:44.794
The only assumption we can operate on
practically is that Sydney is alive

26:44.869 --> 26:46.894
and Tomazaki has some need for her.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.337
So where is she?

26:48.406 --> 26:51.068
Rio was Tomazaki's call, not mine.
It's his turf.

26:51.142 --> 26:54.441
Meaning he most likely has some
sort of base here - satellite office, maybe.

26:54.512 --> 26:57.777
Marshall, does Tomazaki's file
indicate property holdings?

26:57.849 --> 27:00.317
I already checked. Nothing.
Nothing in Rio, nothing anywhere in Brazil.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.979
We know someone with intel - the agent
who led us to Tomazaki in the first place.

27:03.054 --> 27:05.215
Well, my daughter
has refused to cooperate.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.121
Still, she gave Sydney Tomazaki's name.

27:07.192 --> 27:10.286
If she were apprised of the situation,
she might help.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.989
I'll make her help.
Where is she?

27:15.567 --> 27:17.797
- Hola.
- This is Michael Vaughn. I'm in Rio.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.433
- Sydney's in trouble.
- Is it Vadik?

27:21.506 --> 27:23.440
Vadik and Tomazaki
are the same person.

27:23.508 --> 27:28.673
Look, we don't know if Sydney's still alive,
but if she is, you're her only hope.

27:30.248 --> 27:32.307
Nadia, please.

27:33.318 --> 27:38.119
Tomazaki used to run an operation
near the Catedral Metropolitana.

27:38.189 --> 27:40.054
OK. I'll need details.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.634
Sydney Bristow.

27:58.576 --> 28:01.101
What happened to the deal?

28:01.913 --> 28:02.902
What?

28:05.984 --> 28:08.578
What happened...

28:08.653 --> 28:11.281
to the deal?

28:21.833 --> 28:26.463
Before you leave this room,
you will tell me why.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.529
I might.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.200
I'm relatively open-minded.

28:33.745 --> 28:37.738
But in this case I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

28:40.952 --> 28:44.149
- Have you eaten breakfast?
- Why? You wanna grab something?

28:44.222 --> 28:46.747
You probably ate breakfast.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.951
Just in case...

28:51.029 --> 28:53.156
we'll wait.

29:50.121 --> 29:53.147
Alana. You're here.

30:28.927 --> 30:32.522
I saw you, standing in the park.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.566
I was looking for the woman
who stole the Shintaro.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.932
Then I saw you and I knew...

30:39.838 --> 30:42.671
this wasn't about the sword.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.373
Somehow you found out...

30:46.444 --> 30:49.208
about the hit.

30:51.382 --> 30:55.011
Which means you must know
why you were spared.

30:55.086 --> 30:58.214
Why the job went away.

31:24.749 --> 31:27.013
I told you,
I don't know about any hit.

31:32.891 --> 31:37.419
You wouldn't be here
if you didn't know about the contract.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.797
What contract?

31:46.838 --> 31:49.864
The contract I had on your life.

31:51.109 --> 31:54.567
You were hired to kill me?
Who hired you?

31:56.180 --> 31:59.672
Sydney.
Assassin-client privilege.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.717
The day before the job,
my client was killed.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.723
Most unfortunate... for me.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.327
I swear to God,
I don't know anything about this.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.297
Somehow I believe you.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.734
I guess... this was just
one of those coincidences.

32:27.245 --> 32:30.510
I guess I can just
sell you the sword and go home.

32:31.115 --> 32:34.050
I'll just take the sword.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.814
How's that?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.300
Tu gostas?

33:00.211 --> 33:03.271
So, Nadia, the tranquilizer lips...
you think it was too red?

33:03.348 --> 33:06.476
- Does Jorge have the key card?
- Got it.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.622
I'm in.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.170
You'll be OK.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.339
Nadia!

33:44.355 --> 33:45.845
Sydney!

33:47.058 --> 33:49.492
Sydney!

34:01.339 --> 34:04.035
- Where's Sydney?
- She went that way.

34:38.309 --> 34:40.243
I was told you were good.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.535
Who hired you?

35:44.408 --> 35:47.241
Who put a contract on my life?

35:48.713 --> 35:51.045
Who hired you?

35:56.587 --> 35:58.555
Derevko.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.623
Irina Derevko.

36:14.038 --> 36:16.336
Congratulations.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.671
We recovered the isotope,

36:19.744 --> 36:22.645
we've eliminated a dangerous enemy,

36:22.713 --> 36:25.739
and the British government
is most grateful for American assistance

36:25.816 --> 36:28.546
in returning the Shintaro sword.

36:30.988 --> 36:36.358
I would also like to announce that
Nadia has accepted my offer to join APO.

36:37.728 --> 36:41.494
I know that she can rely on your
full support in the days and weeks ahead.

36:41.566 --> 36:45.559
So, that's it. Go home.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.067
Feel good about what you've done.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.489
How did you find out?

37:12.563 --> 37:15.760
Tomazaki. He had the contract.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.567
You didn't know?

37:28.246 --> 37:33.707
I merely knew your mother
had hired someone. I didn't know who.

37:33.784 --> 37:35.752
I had only one way to stop him.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.151
Why would she want me dead?

37:45.396 --> 37:46.920
I don't know.

37:55.539 --> 37:58.565
You killed her to save me.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.873
You killed Mom...

38:01.946 --> 38:04.176
to save me.

38:10.254 --> 38:12.779
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:08.946 --> 39:11.437
Syd, are you OK?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.997
Thank you.

39:50.454 --> 39:53.821
I just... I don't see it.
You working in a bank?

39:53.891 --> 39:55.688
Come on. What kind of job
is that? You know?

39:55.760 --> 39:59.526
Cashing checks and making change.
"Excuse me. Next in line, please. "

39:59.597 --> 40:02.862
I'm a loan officer.
I travel. Service accounts.

40:02.933 --> 40:05.231
Wait a minute.
That cover job you had for SD-6?

40:05.302 --> 40:07.065
- I happen to be good at it.
- Great.

40:07.138 --> 40:10.972
That's stimulating stuff -
watching someone else's cash.

40:11.041 --> 40:14.568
Syd, come on, seriously,
since you left the spy biz you are a bore.

40:14.645 --> 40:17.773
It's an adjustment, is all. Are you sure
you don't want to stay for dinner?

40:17.848 --> 40:20.817
I'd love to, but I gotta save the world.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.649
- See ya.
- Bye.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.990
I'm Eric Weiss. 38, single.

40:31.762 --> 40:32.854
Nadia.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.626
- How are you?
- Good. Is this a bad time?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.968
Not at all. Nadia, this is Eric.

40:38.035 --> 40:41.266
- He was just leaving.
- No, no, no. I can stay.

40:41.705 --> 40:44.503
- Or go. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

40:45.843 --> 40:49.176
What's going on?

40:53.350 --> 40:55.784
I just couldn't wait...

40:55.853 --> 40:58.686
even until tomorrow.

41:01.959 --> 41:05.486
I was hoping
we could talk about our mother.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.026
Did you bring your passport?

41:26.951 --> 41:29.419
Our mother was killed.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.183
I found her body
in a state medical facility.

41:32.256 --> 41:34.816
I identified her, paid for her release,

41:34.892 --> 41:36.860
made arrangements
with the mausoleum in Moscow

41:36.927 --> 41:39.521
three blocks from where she was born.

41:39.597 --> 41:42.395
I thought she'd want it that way.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.412
And you have no idea
who was responsible?

42:06.490 --> 42:09.050
Who killed her?

42:11.395 --> 42:12.419
No.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.992
I swear to God,

42:19.069 --> 42:23.335
somehow, I will find out
who did this to our mother...

42:25.976 --> 42:28.274
and I will kill him.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.374
I will.
