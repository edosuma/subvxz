>> damien: Dear sinead,
I tried not to get
into this war.

1:57:00.581 --> 1:57:02.547
I tried not to get
into this war.
And did.

1:57:02.549 --> 1:57:04.082
Into this war.
And did.
And now try to get out

1:57:04.084 --> 1:57:09.454
And did.
And now try to get out
and can't.

1:57:09.456 --> 1:57:11.323
And now try to get out
and can't.
Strange creatures we are,

1:57:11.325 --> 1:57:14.192
And can't.
Strange creatures we are,
even to ourselves.

1:57:14.194 --> 1:57:17.095
Strange creatures we are,
even to ourselves.
I treasure every bit of you,

1:57:17.097 --> 1:57:19.097
Even to ourselves.
I treasure every bit of you,
body and soul, in these last

1:57:19.099 --> 1:57:21.833
I treasure every bit of you,
body and soul, in these last
few moments.

1:57:21.835 --> 1:57:23.268
Body and soul, in these last
few moments.
You once said you wanted your

1:57:23.270 --> 1:57:25.704
Few moments.
You once said you wanted your
children to taste freedom.

1:57:25.706 --> 1:57:27.072
You once said you wanted your
children to taste freedom.
I pray for that day too,

1:57:27.074 --> 1:57:28.740
Children to taste freedom.
I pray for that day too,
sinead, but I fear it will be

1:57:28.742 --> 1:57:30.542
I pray for that day too,
sinead, but I fear it will be
longer than either of us

1:57:30.544 --> 1:57:32.711
Sinead, but I fear it will be
longer than either of us
have imagined.

1:57:32.713 --> 1:57:33.979
Longer than either of us
have imagined.

I'm afraid, inside,

Look after teddy.
I'm afraid, inside,

I'm afraid, inside,
he's already dead.
As the clock ticks on,

He's already dead.
As the clock ticks on,
I imagine your heartbeat

1:58:05.379 --> 1:58:08.313
As the clock ticks on,
I imagine your heartbeat
under my hand.

1:58:08.315 --> 1:58:09.548
I imagine your heartbeat
under my hand.
I hold the medal you hung

1:58:09.550 --> 1:58:10.816
Under my hand.
I hold the medal you hung
around my neck and

1:58:10.818 --> 1:58:12.918
I hold the medal you hung
around my neck and
I tremble inside.

1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:18.056
Around my neck and
I tremble inside.
It will give you courage too.

1:58:18.058 --> 1:58:20.425
I tremble inside.
It will give you courage too.
Good-bye, sinead.

1:58:20.427 --> 1:58:23.795
It will give you courage too.
Good-bye, sinead.
I love you now and always will.

Good-bye, sinead.
I love you now and always will.
