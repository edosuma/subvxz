WEBVTT

00:01.866 --> 00:04.562
Get in there! Get in!

00:09.574 --> 00:11.235
- You owe two shillings.
- Mercy, my lord.

00:11.309 --> 00:13.539
You've had a week to find it, now pay up.

00:13.611 --> 00:15.636
If he has no money, take goods to the value.

00:16.178 --> 00:17.875
If he has nothing of value, take him.

00:17.949 --> 00:22.851
This is the King's annual duty
to finance his crusade against the heathen.

00:24.187 --> 00:29.215
You can't pay, you go to prison.
Sheriff's decree - no exceptions, no tolerance.

00:29.291 --> 00:31.453
Next cottage.

00:36.165 --> 00:41.159
Gisborne's men. Now we know
why Luke couldn't make the weapons drop.

00:41.237 --> 00:43.899
If the King knew what was being
done in his name...

00:50.578 --> 00:52.944
Alice.

00:53.382 --> 00:55.406
John, come here a moment.

00:58.153 --> 00:59.586
Act normal, we don't know anything.

00:59.654 --> 01:01.416
Ah, the cooper.

01:03.992 --> 01:05.754
He owes three shillings.

01:06.594 --> 01:09.756
Take what you want,
I have no money left to give you.

01:10.931 --> 01:12.796
Goods to the value.

01:13.534 --> 01:16.298
Move! And you.

01:21.174 --> 01:24.871
We could hardly pay the tithe rent as it was,
and now another tax.

01:24.944 --> 01:27.469
It's stupid to go on like this, Alice.

01:28.381 --> 01:30.679
I'm fond of you and the boy.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.843
As man and wife,
we could cover the taxes.

01:33.286 --> 01:34.651
No, get away from there.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.119
- Come here, you rat.
- Leave us alone.

01:36.189 --> 01:40.284
- John!
- Leave us alone, get off!

01:40.358 --> 01:43.259
Here. Here, sir, our tools.

01:43.328 --> 01:46.092
They must be worth a few coins, take them.

01:46.164 --> 01:49.894
- Leave us alone!
- My lord, weapons.

01:49.968 --> 01:52.197
- Well, well, well.
- Stop it!

01:52.269 --> 01:54.601
Saracen design.

01:54.672 --> 01:56.140
- Get off!
- Now...

01:56.974 --> 02:00.000
Where does a Locksley cooper
learn this type of work?

02:01.980 --> 02:05.346
There 's only one Englishman I know
that uses a bow like this.

02:07.785 --> 02:12.552
Collaborate with outlaws
and you will be punished like an outlaw.

02:13.991 --> 02:16.925
- Take him away.
- No!

02:18.161 --> 02:19.629
- Papa!
- No, John!

02:20.798 --> 02:22.196
No!

02:22.265 --> 02:27.497
Sir! P lease, I beg you,
don't hurt the boy.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.595
My apprentice, he's innocent.

02:29.671 --> 02:30.797
The runt.

02:30.873 --> 02:33.273
Oh, we must make an example of him.

02:33.342 --> 02:36.004
- Take the boy too.
- Leave him alone!

02:36.079 --> 02:37.807
Take your hands off my son!

02:37.880 --> 02:39.507
John, John. There are too many.

02:39.581 --> 02:40.843
He's innocent!

02:42.984 --> 02:45.510
- John!
- He's my son!

02:45.587 --> 02:48.646
And we will help him, but not this way.

02:48.723 --> 02:50.156
John!

02:56.464 --> 03:00.958
- Little John!
- Mother! Help us!

03:06.373 --> 03:08.103
Mother, help!

03:08.176 --> 03:10.303
Little John!

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074

03:50.380 --> 03:52.372
John, stop. We need the others.

03:52.450 --> 03:54.384
- The coach is too well guarded.
- No!

03:54.452 --> 03:56.784
I will not let you do this. It is too reckless.

03:56.854 --> 04:00.153
- They have my son!
- I value your life too highly.

04:00.224 --> 04:02.089
Him, I value more.

04:07.364 --> 04:11.733
Clear the path!
Move that branch out of the way.

04:11.802 --> 04:13.826
Get that log cleared. Go on.

04:13.903 --> 04:16.269
Put your backs into it.

04:18.374 --> 04:20.036
Aaargh!

04:20.743 --> 04:23.610
Come on, then! Come on!

04:37.192 --> 04:39.183
Hang on. Hang on.

04:46.734 --> 04:48.635
Get the cab to Nottingham!

05:17.562 --> 05:19.029
Ah, John.

05:37.715 --> 05:39.740
Halt! You may pass.

05:51.362 --> 05:53.387
- Out of the way, scum.
- All right!

05:53.464 --> 05:56.296
Taxes! Taxes!

05:56.366 --> 05:58.664
Last day for the King's levy. Come on now.

05:58.735 --> 06:00.202
Taxes?

06:00.270 --> 06:01.965
- Taxes.
- We're here to collect taxes.

06:02.439 --> 06:04.873
You three, you paid your ale tax?

06:04.941 --> 06:07.808
- You what? Ale taxes?
- Take them away.

06:07.877 --> 06:09.503
What are you doing? I haven't done anything.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.570
- Gambling, now?
- You must be kidding.

06:11.647 --> 06:14.845
Bet you haven't got a license, eh?

06:16.652 --> 06:19.120
- You lose! Take him away.
- Ah!

06:19.655 --> 06:21.020
We can't help everyone.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.524
We got to find my mate's wife
and make deliveries.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.234
- Spare some coins, sir?
- Ah, there she is.

06:34.302 --> 06:36.429
Her husband died two nights ago.

06:36.504 --> 06:39.064
The Sheriff's men beat him up.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.509
It's a gift from Robin Hood.

06:44.412 --> 06:47.904
She looks like a vagrant to me, and her brat.

06:48.648 --> 06:50.582
Where did you steal this from, then, eh?

06:50.650 --> 06:52.380
Take her away.

07:00.093 --> 07:02.458
Go, quickly.

07:02.528 --> 07:05.019
- Thank you, thank you.
- Will!

07:06.065 --> 07:07.999
- Guards!
- Come back here!

07:08.667 --> 07:11.227
- Get them!
- Make way for the prisoners.

07:21.713 --> 07:23.681
- Go!
- Little John?

07:38.262 --> 07:41.027
I've had one of these pointed in my face before.
Very pretty.

07:41.098 --> 07:43.794
What does this have to do with
the King's annual duty?

07:43.867 --> 07:46.233
We found this whilst collecting in Locksley.

07:46.303 --> 07:49.500
The man who made it
has been supplying Robin Hood.

07:49.573 --> 07:52.166
And you have him here,
in the dungeons?

07:52.241 --> 07:54.176
Ah. Well, now you interest me.

07:59.882 --> 08:05.376
Our troops could benefit from this bowmaker' s
skill, we must learn from him.

08:05.454 --> 08:07.423
Learn?

08:07.490 --> 08:08.820
We should execute him.

08:08.890 --> 08:13.691
Do I detect a note of sourness in your tone,
Gisborne, hm?

08:13.762 --> 08:16.822
Disillusioned with life
as Lord of Locksley Manor, hm?

08:16.898 --> 08:18.388
Peasants don't like you very much?

08:18.467 --> 08:21.595
Wish Robin Hood would come back?
Oh, what a shame.

08:21.670 --> 08:24.433
If a peasant defies us, we must punish him.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.030
Hard.

08:26.107 --> 08:28.666
We must make an example of him
in front of the rest.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.643
We must make a event of it.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.736
An event?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.782
Why not?

08:35.850 --> 08:40.808
I'll invite all the leaders of the local community,
attendance compulsory.

08:40.886 --> 08:43.082
We should be very creative
in our use of punishments.

08:43.155 --> 08:47.490
The scourge - I love a good lashing.
Mutilation, of course torture.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.018
But right here,
right here in the great hall.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.224
Ah... A Festival of Pain.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.995
Ho... Oh!

08:56.069 --> 08:59.334
We need to use our heads.
This is not just about John.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.099
Luke the cooper was trying to help us,
and the boy.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.834
We have a responsibility to them too.

09:02.908 --> 09:06.139
- I did not know John had a family.
- Neither did he till recently.

09:06.211 --> 09:08.475
As soon the Sheriff realizes
he's one of us, he'll be hanged.

09:08.547 --> 09:10.981
That's the thing.
The Sheriff won't necessarily know.

09:11.049 --> 09:14.108
- What? These...
- Without these, he's just another outlaw.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.414
He has never been just another outlaw.

09:15.487 --> 09:17.785
You think the Sheriff cares if
he wears one of these or not?

09:17.856 --> 09:20.824
He's right. They'll hang him anyway.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.053
Which is why we need a really good plan.

09:24.262 --> 09:26.822
Most unfortunate.

09:26.898 --> 09:30.061
A craftsman like you
wasting your skills on outlaws.

09:31.869 --> 09:34.894
I've always admired artisans.

09:38.275 --> 09:42.211
Make me Saracen war bows like Robin Hood's

09:42.279 --> 09:44.247
and all this will stop.

09:45.282 --> 09:49.377
I might even allow you
a little more time to pay your taxes.

09:53.557 --> 09:55.820
Such talent...

09:55.891 --> 09:57.358
All going to waste.

09:57.426 --> 09:59.054
Continue.

09:59.128 --> 10:02.029
If he doesn't speak, well...

10:02.097 --> 10:03.620
start with the boy.

10:09.772 --> 10:11.671
Please, why won't you let me through?

10:11.739 --> 10:14.207
- He's just a little boy.
- No.

10:14.275 --> 10:17.608
If I could just speak to the Sheriff.
I just want to see my son.

10:17.679 --> 10:20.203
Why won't you let me through?

10:20.848 --> 10:23.373
I just need to see him.

10:33.093 --> 10:36.585
It seems the Sheriff is determined
to arrest half of Nottingham.

10:36.662 --> 10:40.622
Just reminding them of their obligations
to the Sheriff and the King,

10:40.701 --> 10:43.135
and of their loyalty to their betters.

10:43.203 --> 10:46.434
Well, if their obligations
are higher and higher taxes,

10:46.506 --> 10:49.804
is it any wonder they need
reminding of their loyalty?

10:49.876 --> 10:52.343
They have nothing to give
and yet they are being punished.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.004
Ah, Marian.

10:55.081 --> 10:56.775
I thought I heard your voice.

10:56.848 --> 10:59.078
Charming as ever, even in dissent.

10:59.150 --> 11:02.085
Who is the one who took out
the squad of soldiers single-handed?

11:02.153 --> 11:04.417
- This one, sir.
- Mm. Ugly brute.

11:06.091 --> 11:10.460
And yet, I feel I have seen him
somewhere before.

11:14.531 --> 11:16.329
Do you think he looks like
one of Robin Hood's men?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.198
Outlaws all look the same to me.

11:18.269 --> 11:19.895
- Huh!
- No necklace, sir.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.268
Obviously just a common brute.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.008
Certainly looks wild enough, though.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.566
Not so tough now are we, eh, wild man?

11:29.480 --> 11:32.004
Certainly beat some civilization into you.

11:32.081 --> 11:34.016
Roll on tomorrow's entertainments.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.381
- Entertainments?
- Festival of Pain!

11:36.452 --> 11:39.683
And throw that brute into the dungeons,
soften him up.

11:41.491 --> 11:44.426
And you know where
you can stick your pipe, too!

11:44.494 --> 11:45.961
Come here, you toe rag.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.409
- You know where to meet with the horses?
- Round the back of the Trip To Jerusalem Inn.

12:01.476 --> 12:05.469
When we rescue them,
we'll need to leave here fast, so don't be late.

12:05.547 --> 12:06.844
How about this?

12:06.915 --> 12:09.179
Your mother wouldn't recognize you.

12:10.551 --> 12:12.212
Come on, let's get on with it.

12:13.187 --> 12:15.178
Will, consider yourself under arrest.

12:15.956 --> 12:17.753
You cannot seriously countenance such cruelty.

12:17.825 --> 12:20.452
- Marian...
- It is not punishment, it is barbaric.

12:20.527 --> 12:23.292
Delicious, is it not, hm?

12:23.364 --> 12:27.390
There is an air of poetry about,
the poetry of pain.

12:28.735 --> 12:34.537
Oh, our peasant's advocate seems
rather upset with me, Gisborne.

12:34.607 --> 12:35.971
Shh!

12:36.041 --> 12:38.636
Drip, drip, drip.

12:39.713 --> 12:42.273
I can hear her heart bleed from here.

12:44.883 --> 12:49.445
Fear humbles even the most
rebellious spirit, my dear.

12:50.456 --> 12:55.086
Robin Hood himself
will come to fear me one day, in time.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.128
Don't doubt it.

13:00.099 --> 13:03.432
My lord, do not forget the wagon with
the King's duty leaves for London tomorrow.

13:03.502 --> 13:07.733
That is your responsibility, Gisborne.
Just make sure it's secure.

13:07.805 --> 13:09.966
Take the whole garrison if needs be.

13:10.475 --> 13:15.242
I would hate to be in your shoes
if all this fell into outlaws' hands.

13:15.313 --> 13:18.645
Especially after all the trouble
we went to collecting it.

13:19.483 --> 13:21.713
Is the castle guard sufficient
for your entertainments?

13:21.785 --> 13:23.810
No, take all you need.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.448
I presume you are going to accompany
the cart, personally.

13:27.524 --> 13:29.617
I will take the wagon as far as the crossroads,

13:29.693 --> 13:33.254
from there two garrisons from Mansfield
will be escorting it as far as London.

13:33.329 --> 13:35.661
Lah-di-dah-di-dah.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.256
Only a fool would attack against such odds.

13:44.273 --> 13:46.207
When we get out of here,

13:46.275 --> 13:48.436
I'll make you a bow of your own.

13:49.277 --> 13:51.268
I'll teach how to use it.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.511
We'll hunt together. Just you and me.

14:01.322 --> 14:04.155
Aargh!

14:04.691 --> 14:07.092
Argh... Ah!

14:12.666 --> 14:16.033
Aaargh! Argh!

14:20.541 --> 14:22.736
Forgive the child, friend.

14:22.810 --> 14:25.505
He's frightened, that's all.

14:25.578 --> 14:27.773
It's him.

14:27.847 --> 14:31.408
That's the man that attacked the guards
on the road from Locksley.

14:34.554 --> 14:37.284
You tried to rescue us?

14:37.356 --> 14:39.324
What do our tools mean to you?

14:42.961 --> 14:44.360
Are you Robin Hood?

14:48.533 --> 14:52.128
- No.
- Then... why?

14:54.038 --> 14:56.529
Little John, leave the poor man alone.

14:57.641 --> 14:59.666
Psst!

14:59.743 --> 15:01.644
It's all right.

15:02.647 --> 15:04.045
You and me...

15:04.114 --> 15:06.082
we met before.

15:09.954 --> 15:12.286
I don't remember, sorry.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.899
Get along there, go on.

15:35.510 --> 15:37.068
Get along there.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.579
- That hurt.
- Don't overdo it, Allan.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.013
Hold it there.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.574
We've got another one
for t'dungeon here. All right?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.118
Go on, then.

15:45.187 --> 15:46.244
Come on, then.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.790
Get along there.

15:52.361 --> 15:53.759
What?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.819
Hey, calm down.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.262
Where do you think you're going?

15:57.331 --> 16:01.062
- There 's a prisoner for t'dungeons.
- You're too late. It's full.

16:01.135 --> 16:02.567
Put him over there with that lot.

16:09.276 --> 16:12.268
- This one seems familiar.
- He's a known troublemaker.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.869
Chain him up with the others.

16:13.947 --> 16:17.576
Yeah, they'll all get
what's coming to them, tomorrow.

16:27.226 --> 16:29.194
Now how do we get in?

16:46.945 --> 16:48.878
Boo! My lady.

16:48.947 --> 16:52.143
The prisoners. I heard there were
families down there, children.

16:52.215 --> 16:53.979
Do they have enough food and water?

16:54.052 --> 16:56.747
This is not some soft inn
for their pleasure, my lady.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.721
That is no reason to ill-treat them.

16:59.757 --> 17:03.248
Actually, I thought I might be
able to see the wild man.

17:03.327 --> 17:05.352
I'm rather intrigued.

17:05.996 --> 17:08.294
No, can't let you in. Sorry.

17:14.737 --> 17:17.103
I want every entrance covered.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.073
Marian?

17:20.142 --> 17:21.665
Guy.

17:21.743 --> 17:23.837
I was just looking for my portmanteau.

17:23.913 --> 17:28.247
I don't know whether they...
took it from the horse already or...

17:28.317 --> 17:30.717
I will have it bought to your room.

17:31.953 --> 17:33.888
I'm glad you decided to stay.

17:33.956 --> 17:37.049
I didn't like to think of you
all alone at Knighton Hall,

17:37.125 --> 17:39.252
with your father away.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.352
May I pass?

17:46.835 --> 17:49.894
Oi, you! Got a job for you.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.068
Not you... Shirker.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.506
Have the Lady Marian's portmanteau
taken from her horse in the stables

17:55.609 --> 17:57.076
and follow me with it to her chamber.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.271
- Yes, my lord.
- Quickly!

18:02.516 --> 18:03.676
Oi!

18:04.818 --> 18:07.752
- Are those the sacks of grain from Locksley?
- Er...

18:07.820 --> 18:11.017
- Yeah.
- Well, move them into the stores, then.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.891
Now!

18:34.246 --> 18:36.076
Ahh! Ah!

18:44.422 --> 18:45.854
Can you get that?

18:45.923 --> 18:47.652
Oh, yes!

18:47.725 --> 18:50.023
Oh, yes! Oh!

18:56.767 --> 18:58.894
Come in.

19:00.937 --> 19:02.336
Marian, your things.

19:02.406 --> 19:04.373
Over there.

19:08.143 --> 19:10.078
Careful, you clumsy oaf!

19:11.214 --> 19:13.307
Marian?

19:13.383 --> 19:15.009
I'm quite well.

19:15.084 --> 19:17.609
Could you put them over there by the bed?

19:26.261 --> 19:28.194
Wait.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.293
Is there something else I can do for you?

19:31.399 --> 19:33.026
Nothing, thank you.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.431
Marian, um...

19:41.509 --> 19:44.376
- For some time now...
- I thought I would rest before dinner.

19:45.146 --> 19:47.079
Hear me out, please.

19:48.949 --> 19:50.314
Is there something the matter?

19:50.383 --> 19:53.841
No, I'm a little out of sorts, that is all.

19:54.921 --> 19:59.620
Since we came to our understanding,
you have been constantly in my thoughts.

20:01.862 --> 20:06.855
Without you, I no longer feel... quite whole.

20:06.932 --> 20:09.628
Please, Sir Guy.
I would rather not talk about this now.

20:09.702 --> 20:11.431
Don't send me away.

20:17.343 --> 20:22.109
We should be spending more time together,
so that we can understand each other better.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.670
I want to know you.

20:23.748 --> 20:26.808
- I am sorry, I cannot.
- Marian...

20:28.186 --> 20:29.743
Be with me.

20:30.888 --> 20:33.049
Please, Guy, not now.

20:35.994 --> 20:37.984
Perhaps you will at least think over
what I have said.

21:03.719 --> 21:05.448
Please don't send me away.

21:07.924 --> 21:10.051
We should be spending more time together.

21:13.729 --> 21:18.290
I thought they would kill him.
But still he will not tell them what they wanted.

21:19.134 --> 21:20.498
Brave man.

21:21.735 --> 21:24.466
Him, I like.

21:27.742 --> 21:29.333
Did you know my mother?

21:31.912 --> 21:33.436
I don't remember you.

21:34.648 --> 21:36.047
Unless...

21:36.116 --> 21:38.516
Mother said I dreamt it.

21:38.586 --> 21:42.352
There was a man once.
He came to our house.

21:42.423 --> 21:44.482
- He was from the forest.
- That was real.

21:44.558 --> 21:46.252
That was me.

21:47.227 --> 21:48.626
What's your name?

21:52.332 --> 21:53.697
I did know your mother once.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.667
My father, he was big.

21:56.736 --> 21:58.465
A giant.

21:58.538 --> 22:00.437
Bigger than you even.

22:00.505 --> 22:03.963
Though... I never knew him.

22:05.277 --> 22:06.642
John.

22:09.548 --> 22:12.881
We will get out of here.

22:12.951 --> 22:14.941
I promise you.

22:16.521 --> 22:18.420
You're mad to be here at all.

22:18.489 --> 22:21.947
Extra guards have been laid on.
The place is full of prisoners.

22:22.026 --> 22:25.052
You know about the Sheriff's plans
for tomorrow?

22:25.129 --> 22:27.654
- The punishments?
- Yes.

22:27.732 --> 22:30.165
- And I intend to stop it.
- With what?

22:30.233 --> 22:31.861
You are few against many.

22:31.936 --> 22:34.336
We few have proved quite effective in the past.

22:34.904 --> 22:37.338
We will rescue them, all of them.

22:38.341 --> 22:41.367
I have a plan. Well, half a plan, I think.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.433
How?

22:44.681 --> 22:47.172
I never give up...

22:47.250 --> 22:49.183
on anyone.

22:49.252 --> 22:51.618
You may discover it is too late for some.

22:55.325 --> 22:58.851
I mean, the way the prisoners
have been treated,

22:58.927 --> 23:00.690
most of them are beyond help.

23:00.763 --> 23:03.664
The bowmaker of Locksley
has already been tortured.

23:03.732 --> 23:06.529
Guy wanted a special example made of him.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.668
He is the first to be punished.

23:08.736 --> 23:13.469
Yet he plays the gallant gentleman
and he does so want to know you.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.441
And you should be glad.

23:15.510 --> 23:17.239
It is because I know him,

23:17.312 --> 23:20.679
I am able to tell you the revenue wagon
leaves tomorrow for London,

23:20.748 --> 23:23.079
- with the King's annual duty.
- And?

23:23.150 --> 23:26.381
The Sheriff thinks you will try
to save your friend, the bowmaker,

23:26.453 --> 23:29.183
whilst the wagon leaves unchallenged.

23:31.158 --> 23:33.649
Right. I have a plan.

23:33.727 --> 23:35.456
Well, where are they?

23:35.529 --> 23:37.496
He said don't be late.

23:39.732 --> 23:42.463
I mean, what if he can't rescue Little John?

23:42.536 --> 23:44.469
What if the Sheriff's hanged him already?

23:44.537 --> 23:46.471
I mean, we've been late once before.

23:46.539 --> 23:49.064
Just shut up, OK?

23:49.141 --> 23:51.132
Shut up.

23:51.210 --> 23:53.075
Sorry.

23:53.145 --> 23:56.637
I have money.
It's only a few coins but if you let me through...

23:56.716 --> 23:58.740
Go home, woman.

23:59.318 --> 24:01.911
Please, I want...

24:01.986 --> 24:03.385
I want my son.

24:03.455 --> 24:06.050
Now, I'd like to sit on
the right-hand side of Marian,

24:06.124 --> 24:08.251
so I can see what a bleeding heart looks like.

24:08.325 --> 24:09.451
Of course, my lord.

24:09.526 --> 24:11.518
- My son!
- Oi! You can't go in there.

24:11.596 --> 24:13.393
You have imprisoned him.

24:13.465 --> 24:16.331
- Get that woman out of here.
- He was arrested in Locksley this morning.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.459
- He's just a boy.
- What's she saying?

24:18.535 --> 24:21.163
This is the business
of the bowmaker and his boy.

24:21.238 --> 24:22.796
The outlaw collaborators.

24:22.873 --> 24:25.967
Oh. And this is the mother of the child?

24:28.912 --> 24:31.312
Oh, come, have some compassion.

24:31.382 --> 24:33.247
Gisborne.

24:33.317 --> 24:35.581
Surely she should be allowed to see her son.

24:36.519 --> 24:38.714
Such insistent maternal concern.

24:38.788 --> 24:42.622
Well, it should stir pity.

24:42.692 --> 24:48.790
Such a pretty face. Hm? It should inspire
our respect, but this one, however,

24:48.865 --> 24:51.765
conceals deceit, disloyalty.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.596
So, take her away,

24:53.668 --> 24:56.136
have her put in the cell
with her son and the cooper.

24:57.706 --> 25:01.540
One bad apple in a family,

25:01.610 --> 25:04.340
and we punish the whole barrel.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.844
Mother!

25:12.553 --> 25:14.545
I knew you'd come.

25:19.627 --> 25:21.822
What's going on? What's happening?

25:21.896 --> 25:23.692
I'm staying with you now.

25:24.432 --> 25:25.796
Luke.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.927
What have they done to you?

25:32.005 --> 25:34.030
John has been looking after me.

25:34.107 --> 25:35.836
Is he badly hurt?

25:35.909 --> 25:37.638
We'll get him out of here.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.702
- That's what my friend said.
- Your friend?

25:42.916 --> 25:45.907
It wasn't a dream.
The man from the forest.

25:45.984 --> 25:47.975
The one that came to our house.

25:53.391 --> 25:54.358
Psst!

25:54.425 --> 25:56.087
Come on.

26:05.570 --> 26:06.969
What's the matter?

26:13.878 --> 26:15.811
You're alive.

26:36.732 --> 26:38.700
Thank you, Marian.

26:53.314 --> 26:55.874
So, you're going to leave me
locked up here all night?

26:56.718 --> 26:58.515
- Yes.
- You're meant to say no.

26:58.586 --> 27:00.554
We're here to free you, stuff like that.

27:00.621 --> 27:03.284
Don't worry, there 's a good reason for it.

27:03.358 --> 27:06.588
Now, take this lock pick.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.890
A friend of mine told me where to find it.

27:08.962 --> 27:11.362
Tomorrow morning, during this Festival of Pain,

27:11.431 --> 27:13.763
you will help John
and these other prisoners escape.

27:14.701 --> 27:18.363
- Do you think these men are with us?
- They've got nothing else to lose.

27:21.108 --> 27:24.235
I'll get word to Much and Djaq.
I'll come back tonight.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.369
Right, scum.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.448
You are not to speak to him again.

27:29.515 --> 27:30.914
Who is he, Alice?

27:31.516 --> 27:33.644
No one.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.551
A dead man.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.188
But he's here now, with us.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.352
- First and last time.
- Alice, please...

27:42.428 --> 27:45.555
Do not speak to me.
You gave up that right long ago.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.462
This man...

27:48.900 --> 27:50.925
Is he who I think he is?

27:52.803 --> 27:55.238
Burns have given you a fever.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.274
John, stay away from there.

28:00.211 --> 28:01.643
I'm sorry.

28:01.712 --> 28:03.510
I can't be your friend any more.

28:03.581 --> 28:06.243
- I know.
- I said stay away from him.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.751
- Alice, it's not the boy's fault.
- He is not your friend.

28:08.819 --> 28:10.844
He is not anybody, you understand?

28:10.921 --> 28:13.650
- Aren't we in enough trouble?
- He's in the same situation.

28:13.723 --> 28:16.123
- We all need each other now.
- Mother...

28:17.327 --> 28:21.457
Alice... Alice, perhaps the boy should know.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.797
John...

28:31.975 --> 28:33.999
This man...

28:34.076 --> 28:35.805
What is it?

28:39.081 --> 28:41.811
John...

28:41.883 --> 28:43.851
I am your father.

28:48.089 --> 28:49.351
Stop worrying.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.254
I'm not worried.

28:51.325 --> 28:53.452
I'm not worried at all, I'm just...

28:54.528 --> 28:55.859
All will be fine.

28:55.930 --> 28:58.228
Oi!

28:58.299 --> 29:00.324
What do you think you're doing?

29:02.102 --> 29:04.468
Er, nothing.

29:05.306 --> 29:11.471
Just, er... my horse. It's lame and, er...
I just wanted to rest him here.

29:13.112 --> 29:14.910
All right, it's me.

29:14.981 --> 29:17.449
Don't do that!

29:17.517 --> 29:19.814
- Where have you been?
- Where is Little John?

29:19.885 --> 29:21.683
There 's been a change of plan.

29:21.755 --> 29:24.154
- Change of plan?
- I found the distraction we needed.

29:24.223 --> 29:26.851
- We're still rescuing Little John?
- Of course we are.

29:26.925 --> 29:28.654
And Luke the bowmaker,

29:28.727 --> 29:30.194
and the boy, and...

29:30.896 --> 29:32.363
Alice Little...

29:32.431 --> 29:34.422
and all the other prisoners.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.058
Oh, and the tax money.

29:36.135 --> 29:38.932
Not a big change, then...

29:40.472 --> 29:42.939
You let me believe you were dead.

29:43.007 --> 29:45.601
I was outlawed. If I'd stayed...

29:45.677 --> 29:49.204
You might have seen your son born,
and provided for your family.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.181
Where were you those winters your baby son
was sick with hunger?

29:52.916 --> 29:58.616
Or the first summer he had to work alongside
me in the field so we could buy a loaf of bread.

29:58.689 --> 30:01.522
Where were you when the Sheriff's guard
did that to his leg?

30:04.895 --> 30:09.025
When you were younger,
before they told me your father was dead,

30:09.099 --> 30:11.828
I used to tell you he would
come home to us one day,

30:11.901 --> 30:14.267
because I wanted to believe it myself.

30:15.104 --> 30:18.767
And then, every time you heard
a horse pass through the village,

30:18.841 --> 30:21.969
you'd run out to see who it was, just in case.

30:23.912 --> 30:25.471
Sheriff's mounted guard...

30:25.548 --> 30:28.847
would not stop for a peasant boy
standing in the road.

30:28.918 --> 30:31.852
Listen, you would have been outlawed too.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.151
It was better just to... to die.

30:35.223 --> 30:38.317
We could have started again somewhere else.
A new name.

30:39.694 --> 30:41.958
I would have followed you anywhere, John.

30:47.301 --> 30:49.326
Not that it matters.

30:50.105 --> 30:54.564
We're all outlaws here,
and tomorrow we shall suffer for it.

30:55.909 --> 30:57.843
Why do we want the sacks of grain?

30:57.911 --> 31:00.470
So Gisborne can take them to London.

31:04.917 --> 31:06.441
No, Robin.

31:06.519 --> 31:08.316
Stores are down near the kitchens, this way.

31:08.387 --> 31:11.845
First things first.
We secure the revenue money. Come on.

31:11.924 --> 31:17.226
...while you rob and murder,
and do what you do.

31:17.296 --> 31:18.820
Alice, leave him.

31:18.898 --> 31:22.799
I have never killed, except to defend myself.

31:23.702 --> 31:26.830
Irobbed to survive,

31:26.905 --> 31:29.965
but now, l-I rob to help others.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.202
What? Like Robin Hood?

31:32.276 --> 31:35.075
Yes, I am one of Robin Hood's men.

31:35.147 --> 31:37.080
But you don't wear a tag.

31:37.148 --> 31:40.345
Luke told me that all of Robin's men wear tags.

31:40.417 --> 31:42.408
Ah, I lost them.

31:42.486 --> 31:44.681
And you expect us to believe you?

31:44.755 --> 31:46.052
It is the truth, Alice.

31:47.091 --> 31:49.116
One lie was enough, John.

31:50.093 --> 31:52.927
Perhaps it's better for us all
if you just stay dead.

31:52.997 --> 31:55.431
In fact, I wish you were dead,

31:55.498 --> 31:57.227
then we won't hear your lies.

31:57.300 --> 32:01.828
The back parry originates in Fiorentina.
You've got to master that one first, Niall.

32:01.905 --> 32:03.600
We've come to relieve you lot.

32:03.673 --> 32:05.641
- You're early.
- Hey, cheer up, lads.

32:05.708 --> 32:07.732
- Get the night off.
- What are you on about?

32:12.715 --> 32:14.443
Oh-ho! Look what I found.

32:14.516 --> 32:18.043
Come on, let's get to work. Grab these.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.746
Lovely money.

32:19.822 --> 32:23.279
Good morning everybody
and welcome to my Festival of Pain.

32:23.358 --> 32:26.383
I want to talk to you about community taxes.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.224
Taxes are a fact.

32:29.897 --> 32:33.458
The cost of living in a free country.

32:34.969 --> 32:40.736
Now, if you do not pay your taxes
then you sacrifice that freedom

32:40.807 --> 32:43.777
and must be punished accordingly.

32:45.178 --> 32:50.241
I am sick and tired of your sob stories.

32:50.317 --> 32:54.515
Can't pay, too old, too sick.

32:55.222 --> 32:58.919
Is this going to help
our beloved King in Acre, hm?

33:03.897 --> 33:05.888
A clue.

33:07.833 --> 33:08.959
No!

33:10.669 --> 33:13.069
Those who understand this...

33:14.506 --> 33:16.531
they will survive.

33:19.311 --> 33:22.871
For those who defy me, well...

33:23.982 --> 33:25.677
the chair of delight.

33:31.755 --> 33:33.746
John, get behind me.

33:33.824 --> 33:36.019
Stay behind me.

33:36.093 --> 33:38.119
You're still my friend.

33:42.799 --> 33:43.959
Forgive me.

33:50.073 --> 33:51.437
Get it loaded up?

33:51.507 --> 33:53.533
Aye, it's all there, sir.

34:09.659 --> 34:11.058
Ready to roll.

34:11.127 --> 34:13.650
These prisoners do not pay their way.

34:13.728 --> 34:17.425
They help those
that seek to undermine my authority,

34:17.498 --> 34:19.864
therefore, they must all be punished.

34:22.270 --> 34:24.500
Now...

34:24.571 --> 34:27.699
Do you think that they're
the only ones to suffer,

34:27.775 --> 34:30.039
do you? No, no, no.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.772
No, because they do not pay their dues.

34:32.846 --> 34:36.246
We, the good citizens, well,
we have to pay more. Hm?

34:36.317 --> 34:40.116
And how on earth are we supposed to support
our king's glorious crusade? Thank you.

34:40.186 --> 34:44.748
If they were to pay their taxes,
then we in the community would pay less.

34:45.391 --> 34:48.053
So, you see what I'm actually trying to do...

34:48.127 --> 34:50.027
is lower taxes.

34:52.831 --> 34:57.201
- Well, I'm feeling strangely moral.
- I'm feeling quite unwell, I think I might...

34:57.270 --> 34:59.237
Yes, probably the peasants, the stench.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.238
Sniff this if it gets too much.

35:01.306 --> 35:04.969
So, let's bring the prisoners out
and start with a little burning, hm?

35:05.043 --> 35:08.706
Now, you people seem to think
that Robin Hood and his men,

35:08.780 --> 35:11.578
they're worthy of your support
and your encouragement.

35:11.650 --> 35:15.017
- Well, let's see.
- Luke, the cooper of Locksley.

35:15.087 --> 35:18.920
- Outlaw collaborator...
- No!

35:20.091 --> 35:22.116
I do forgive you.

35:24.195 --> 35:26.561
Alice of Locksley and her son, John.

35:26.630 --> 35:29.826
- Outlaw sympathizers.
- Please, they had nothing to do with this.

35:29.899 --> 35:30.991
It is my doing.

35:32.168 --> 35:34.000
Oh, gallantry.

35:34.071 --> 35:35.867
You see, Marian? It's not dead.

35:35.973 --> 35:37.530
Well, not yet.

35:43.413 --> 35:46.404
Such a gallant intervention, hm?

35:46.482 --> 35:47.848
I wonder...

35:47.917 --> 35:50.908
I wonder how I could reward that, hm?

35:52.955 --> 35:55.321
Oh, I wonder.

35:55.391 --> 35:58.019
Shall we have him crawl in the coals first, hm?

35:58.093 --> 36:01.893
So gallant in the heat of the moment.
Oh, so gallant.

36:05.299 --> 36:08.030
Shall the bowmaker go first or the apprentice?

36:08.103 --> 36:10.127
Decisions, decisions.

36:21.815 --> 36:23.942
Get along there.

36:36.396 --> 36:39.729
Why are they closing
the gates? Stop!

36:47.606 --> 36:49.801
Give me your knife.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.246
Robin Hood!

36:56.882 --> 36:58.611
We've been tricked.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.151
Open the gates!

37:03.855 --> 37:06.722
See, bowmaker of Locksley,
cross me and your family suffer.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.986
- No, no!
- So, who's first?

37:09.059 --> 37:12.325
The boy? Oh, brave.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.691
Burn him! Burn him!

37:17.802 --> 37:20.326
No!

37:20.404 --> 37:23.601
- Stop him.
- Take him! He'll never get out of that!

37:23.674 --> 37:25.039
Take him down!

37:28.145 --> 37:30.875
- Take him.
- You are a dead man!

37:30.948 --> 37:33.075
Stop him, you fools!

37:33.683 --> 37:36.151
Charity starts at home, Vaizey!

37:36.819 --> 37:39.117
Not in my home! Kill him!

37:42.792 --> 37:44.760
- Stop it!
- Follow your orders!

37:44.827 --> 37:46.794
I am in command!

37:52.801 --> 37:55.065
Get off my money!

38:06.647 --> 38:08.137
John!

38:09.416 --> 38:10.474
John!

38:10.551 --> 38:12.542
Duck!

38:14.788 --> 38:15.948
Alice, go!

38:17.992 --> 38:20.790
Might have known he was one of yours, Hood.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.158
You torture children!

38:28.435 --> 38:30.868
You said you were no murderer.

38:30.937 --> 38:32.165
Not of men.

38:32.238 --> 38:33.796
This is a devil.

38:33.873 --> 38:36.466
- Good answer!
- For your son's sake.

38:36.542 --> 38:38.703
Mummy! Mummy!

38:46.885 --> 38:49.854
Ah, you just couldn't...

38:49.922 --> 38:51.912
Oof!

38:54.258 --> 38:55.590
Go now.

38:55.661 --> 38:57.821
Oh, not again!

38:58.829 --> 39:01.354
Quick, Mother! Come on!

39:07.405 --> 39:10.737
Will someone get this gate open?
In the name of the King!

39:25.488 --> 39:27.148
Back to the castle, now!

40:14.735 --> 40:16.600
Ah! Argh!

40:16.670 --> 40:18.193
Get me out of this, Gisborne!

40:18.272 --> 40:19.796
Get off my money!

40:19.873 --> 40:21.898
Get off my...

40:27.480 --> 40:31.917
Thank you for everything you've done,
and for these.

40:31.984 --> 40:35.078
I'm sorry this meant leaving behind your home.

40:35.154 --> 40:38.590
Oh, I have gained something
more precious.

40:51.469 --> 40:53.835
It's a shame Little John can't go with them.

40:54.873 --> 40:57.239
He knows it's too late for that.

41:04.682 --> 41:06.206
We'd best get started.

41:06.283 --> 41:08.773
- We've got a long way to go.
- Yeah.

41:29.672 --> 41:32.265
Luke is a good man, John.

41:32.341 --> 41:34.172
We can make a life together.

41:35.677 --> 41:37.907
You deserve that.

41:40.482 --> 41:42.712
Alice...

41:45.486 --> 41:49.855
You take care of yourself, and our son.

41:56.097 --> 41:58.428
I will always remember.

42:10.076 --> 42:12.806
I...

42:12.879 --> 42:15.245
I thought you might like this back.

42:16.883 --> 42:19.646
There 's only one, where is the other?

42:21.254 --> 42:23.620
I shall never forget!

42:23.690 --> 42:28.854
My father is a comrade of Robin Hood!

42:34.866 --> 42:37.232
Goodbye, my son.

42:50.848 --> 42:52.213
Him...

42:52.283 --> 42:53.840
I am proud to know.

42:54.685 --> 42:56.345
You...

42:56.420 --> 42:58.388
I'm stuck with.

42:58.455 --> 43:00.286
Oi, John!

43:00.891 --> 43:02.916
I made you a new staff.

43:02.993 --> 43:04.961
Thanks.
