3 points we should discuss, okay?

08:01.041 --> 08:04.277
First off, in our initial
conversations about exclusivity

08:04.278 --> 08:08.081
I distinctly recall you saying
something about "staying casual," yeah?

08:08.082 --> 08:09.649
- I only said that...
- Most likely because you thought

08:09.651 --> 08:11.084

- Yes.
- Okay. Well, me taking you at your word

08:14.122 --> 08:16.923
doesn't make me an asshole, it
does however make you a liar.

Ugh! You're such a piece of shit...

08:18.658 --> 08:21.560
Hey. Second... second point. Okay?

08:21.561 --> 08:24.064
If you really, actually wanted monogamy

08:24.065 --> 08:27.535
why have casual sex
with me for three months?

08:27.536 --> 08:30.804
You know, I mean, If you wanna grow
flowers, you don't plant 'em in a closet.

08:30.805 --> 08:35.975
So either you're stupid or deep down
inside you don't want monogamy either.

08:35.976 --> 08:38.078
You fucked my best friend.

08:38.078 --> 08:40.613
Which brings me to my
third and final point.

08:40.614 --> 08:43.750
Your chief complaint is
not that I screwed someone

08:43.751 --> 08:45.718
it is <i>who</i> I screwed.

- Was a lot...

driven by a societal insecurity.

infused female competition.

this and make things worse.

when you fucked him 16 times!

fuckin', swarthy man...

have to do this in public

13:23.296 --> 13:25.030

I'm trying to get better.

You can't get better.

Lainey, you're not an addict, okay?

15:00.193 --> 15:03.329
I thought "love" was a feeling.

<i>over and over again to choose
sex over my self-worth.</i>

Oh, my God. Were y-you
just in that meeting?

16:17.070 --> 16:18.771
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure was. Uh-huh.

16:18.772 --> 16:21.964
Yeah. Had to get out of there,
though. It was making me super horny.

16:23.777 --> 16:27.680
Wow. It's been... What? 12 years?

16:27.681 --> 16:30.083
I think it might actually be longer. Yeah.

- Wow.
- Yeah. You look good.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.521

- Thank you.

16:35.522 --> 16:39.059
Wow! The "Old virgin."

16:39.060 --> 16:41.395
Don't you mean the one that got away?

16:41.396 --> 16:43.462
- Stop.
- <i>Oh, last thing I remember, we had that...</i>

16:43.463 --> 16:46.632
awesome night together
and you just sort of...

16:46.633 --> 16:49.567

I assume like... doctor things?

17:00.714 --> 17:02.581
- Aren't you a doctor now?
- Oh, I didn't do that.

17:02.582 --> 17:04.251
I didn't end up going to med school.

17:04.252 --> 17:05.617
- Oh.
- I teach...

17:05.618 --> 17:07.186

Alright.

17:10.157 --> 17:11.824
You? What do you... what do you...

17:11.825 --> 17:14.325
A buddy and I created this
CDN and we're selling it

17:14.326 --> 17:16.162

And you're bored already?

17:16.163 --> 17:17.263
- No.
- You just asked me.

17:17.265 --> 17:19.800
I know. I'm sorry. I have to...

- No, no, Heaven's no.

[Lainey laughs]

17:41.588 --> 17:43.422
I'll see you around.

17:43.423 --> 17:45.691
Hopefully not here.

17:45.692 --> 17:47.182
Yeah.

17:47.862 --> 17:49.684
Hey, I'm on Facebook!

[instrumental music]

18:09.784 --> 18:13.419
- You know, I have one last question... actually...
- Oh, come on. Come on.

18:13.420 --> 18:18.491
It's like... um, when I sign
this, what happens to everything

18:18.492 --> 18:21.495
that Xander and I worked on,
like, all the content we created?

18:21.496 --> 18:26.197
We dissolve all past and current product.
And you'll work exclusively for us.

18:26.198 --> 18:29.736
Yeah. Right. Time to settle down.

18:29.737 --> 18:33.640
- That's true. That's true. But what if we have...
- No. No.

18:33.641 --> 18:37.343
I will straight up murder you if
you do not sign this immediately.

18:37.344 --> 18:39.179
Xander, I'm lookin' out for us.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.913
You're lookin' out for us?
No, I'm lookin' out for us.

18:40.914 --> 18:42.782
- You're being a dick...
- <i>Here's the thing, guys.</i>

18:42.783 --> 18:45.885
I don't negotiate, but my lawyers do.

18:45.886 --> 18:48.755
So if you wanna reopen the terms
of the contract, that's fine

18:48.756 --> 18:51.291
I'm just gonna go grab some lunch.

18:51.292 --> 18:56.630
No, alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.
Okay. You know... y... you just...

18:56.631 --> 18:58.465
<i>You don't have to go for lunch yet.</i>

18:58.466 --> 19:00.255
Okay.

19:04.438 --> 19:06.739
Congrats, boys. You
have officially sold out.

19:06.740 --> 19:09.440
Fuck yes!

19:09.442 --> 19:12.545
Oh, my God!

19:12.546 --> 19:14.581
- I really thought you were gonna fuck this up.
- Me too.

19:14.582 --> 19:18.919
- I really did. He fucks everything in life up.
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.754
I have two beautiful children

19:20.755 --> 19:23.354
both are gonna have
ridiculously terrible teeth.

19:23.355 --> 19:26.593
So you're getting braces,
you're getting braces

19:26.594 --> 19:28.349
you're getting braces!

19:29.528 --> 19:32.253
Hey. You going to lunch? Can I come with?

19:34.266 --> 19:37.304
Dinner maybe? How about brunch
with my folks, you'll love them.

19:37.305 --> 19:38.271
- You're smart, handsome...
- Thank you.

19:38.272 --> 19:40.873
And now have stocks vesting until 2018.

19:40.874 --> 19:42.409
You can go get any woman you want.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.275
Really? Well, I still choose you.

19:44.276 --> 19:46.212
Why? Because I happened
to be in your eye-line?

19:46.213 --> 19:47.613
Possibly because you're uninterested.

19:47.614 --> 19:49.716
Most likely because you're
stunning and successful.

19:49.717 --> 19:51.382
- I'm divorced.
- His loss.

19:51.383 --> 19:52.986
- I have a kid.
- I love kids.

19:52.987 --> 19:54.121
Kids love me. I basically am a kid.

19:54.122 --> 19:57.224
- And I don't sleep with my employees.
- I quit.

19:57.225 --> 19:58.756
Goodbye, Jacob.

19:58.758 --> 20:00.715
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

20:01.629 --> 20:03.729
- Huh.
- What?

20:03.730 --> 20:05.599
Paula's somethin' else, huh?

20:05.600 --> 20:07.266
Yeah, she really is.

20:07.267 --> 20:09.301
She was vibin' me pretty
hard in that meeting.

20:09.302 --> 20:11.871
- Well, you're a married man.
- Yeah, I know. I made sure to tell her.

20:11.872 --> 20:13.974
- 'Cause I was, like, I didn't wanna embarrass her...
- Yeah, yeah.

20:13.975 --> 20:15.674
- That's good. Let her down easy.
- Yeah.

Sobvechik's office.</i>

Yes, um... sorry. It's Lainey.
Only my father calls me Elaine.

20:43.270 --> 20:46.439
You didn't have to make an appointment.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.797
This used to be our move. Me
pretending to be a patient.

20:53.014 --> 20:54.979
You look great.

20:54.980 --> 20:57.816
It's been a while.

20:57.817 --> 21:00.075
I get worried when you disappear.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.789
Me too.

21:03.790 --> 21:06.814
It's really good to see you.
W... what do you wanna talk about?

21:08.461 --> 21:10.384
- I can't see you anymore.
- I agree.

21:12.699 --> 21:14.823
Yeah. I think...

21:16.403 --> 21:19.773
- We need to be over.
- I asked Emma to marry me.

21:19.774 --> 21:21.474
I mean, she kept bringing it up.

21:21.475 --> 21:23.374
Thought it was the right thing to do.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.299
<i>Dr. Sobvechik's office...</i>

21:27.047 --> 21:29.082
Oh, you and Emma got back together?

21:29.083 --> 21:32.074
Yes, uh... uh did I not tell you that?

21:40.361 --> 21:45.064
- How is Sam?
- He is... fine.

21:45.065 --> 21:46.522
Good.

21:50.371 --> 21:53.896
Glad we ended it face to
face. You were right to come.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.417
Will you do me a favor?

22:04.418 --> 22:07.911
Will you erase your number from my phone?

22:09.956 --> 22:12.147
I won't be able to do it.

23:07.614 --> 23:09.648
Is this what you want, Elaine?

23:09.649 --> 23:11.182
Yes.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.574
I want it all the time.
It's all I think about.

<i>- He's getting married.
- Who would marry him?</i>

24:09.609 --> 24:12.511
<i>Like, can she consent?
Is she in a coma?</i>

24:12.512 --> 24:15.781
I mean, who is this person?
Where do you find her?

24:15.782 --> 24:17.917
Some sort of, like, website

24:17.918 --> 24:20.820
for people who want to have
a horrible, painful life...

24:20.821 --> 24:24.523
I think I need to stop having
sex all together for a while.

24:24.524 --> 24:26.792
No, alright. The problem isn't sex.

24:26.793 --> 24:28.092
The problem is Captain Amazing

24:28.094 --> 24:29.661
has monopolized your vag for like a decade

24:29.662 --> 24:30.830
and now you're a pod person.

24:30.831 --> 24:33.099
But maybe if I'm not having any sex...

24:33.100 --> 24:35.101
And become a sexually anorexic? No.

24:35.102 --> 24:36.969
What? Is that a real thing?

24:36.970 --> 24:38.138
Yeah, of course it's a real thing.

24:38.139 --> 24:40.873
Sexual anorexian. It's like
depriving yourself of sex

24:40.874 --> 24:45.543
because of low self-esteem,
or abuse or other gnarly shit.

24:45.544 --> 24:47.246
That's great. That's another dysfunction
I have to worry about developing.

24:47.247 --> 24:49.849
It's like enough with this shit.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.718
Sobvechik! It's like enough!

24:51.719 --> 24:53.918
I mean, you can do so much better.

24:53.919 --> 24:56.021
I don't care if it's a woman
or if it's somebody else

24:56.022 --> 24:59.557
just anything but the schmuck.

24:59.558 --> 25:02.128
I feel like people are looking at us.

25:02.129 --> 25:03.129
The guy I lost my virginity to

25:03.130 --> 25:05.030
was at my sex addicts meeting.

25:05.032 --> 25:06.865
What do you think that means?

25:06.866 --> 25:08.267
It's a sign.

25:08.268 --> 25:12.804
You should fuck that guy. A lot.

25:12.805 --> 25:16.642
<i>I don't think everyone should just be
running around fucking willy-nilly, okay?</i>

25:16.643 --> 25:21.202
In your specific case I do think
you should fuck that sex addict.

25:24.817 --> 25:27.052
♪ One look in the mirror ♪

25:27.054 --> 25:30.412
♪ And I know the party is over ♪♪

25:32.625 --> 25:34.183
You have lipstick on your teeth.

25:35.930 --> 25:38.564
- Thank you.
- This is my wife! This is Blainey.

25:38.565 --> 25:40.865
- Lainey. Lainey... with an L.
- Oh.

25:40.866 --> 25:43.457
What's wrong with you?

25:43.967 --> 25:45.970
- Never make it end.
- This is, uh, Lainey! Lainey, Naomi.

25:45.971 --> 25:48.908
- Oh, may God.
- This is my wife.

25:48.909 --> 25:51.811
Shots. I'm getting everybody shot. Shots
for all round. We're going to keep it going.

25:51.812 --> 25:54.046
Top shelf, bro, because
we're rich as shit now.

25:54.047 --> 25:56.849
- Okay, stop screaming that.
- Rich as shit!

25:56.850 --> 26:00.018
I'm telling you, someone's gonna
murder us if you keep screaming...

26:00.019 --> 26:05.024
I don't care. We're in a cool
bar. I just bought a Tesla!

26:05.025 --> 26:07.927
That's not true. We are borrowing
a Tesla to see if we like it.

26:07.928 --> 26:10.862
- Yeah.
- Listen, are you guys, um...

26:10.863 --> 26:13.165
- Are you guys sleeping with each other?
- No.

26:13.166 --> 26:15.868
- Oh, good. Oh, my God, good.
- What're you guys talking about?

26:15.869 --> 26:17.937
I'm telling her not to
have sex with you! Sorry.

26:17.938 --> 26:21.596
Oh, yeah, well you're too late! 'Cause
we lost our virginity to each other!

26:23.611 --> 26:25.143
- Are you serious?
- You didn't know.

26:25.144 --> 26:28.380
- Yeah, I told him earlier.
- We all knew. You didn't know!

26:28.382 --> 26:30.616
- That's a beautiful story.
- Yeah.

26:30.617 --> 26:32.250
- So romantic.
- Right!

26:32.251 --> 26:33.885
Here we go. Bring it in.

26:33.886 --> 26:36.089
- To virginity!
- To virginity!

26:36.090 --> 26:37.813
Get lost.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.660
- Here we go.
- I gotta go. I just gonna go outside for a...

26:42.661 --> 26:45.930
That was good. Naomi still
has her anal virginity.

26:45.931 --> 26:48.634
That's not true. A lot of guys
have been up there, just not you.

26:48.635 --> 26:50.169
Oh, wait, wait. Girl, girl, girl...

26:50.170 --> 26:52.104
- Lainey, her name's Lainey.
- Lainey. Lainey, I'm sorry.

26:52.105 --> 26:54.273
Quick question before
you walk out the door...

26:54.274 --> 26:59.245
Are you the reason that my friend Jake
here is like, the biggest slut in the world?

26:59.246 --> 27:01.213
- What are you doing?
- I'm saying, like

27:01.214 --> 27:03.416
he puts his dick in like,
every sticky hole he finds.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.217
- That's not true.
- It gross.

27:05.218 --> 27:06.352
- Xander.
- But like I'm jels.

27:06.353 --> 27:08.687
Come on.

27:08.688 --> 27:10.355
- No, I'm just kidding.
- I don't know. I don't know.

27:10.356 --> 27:12.056
I'm just kidding. I know it's
not you. I know it's not you.

27:12.057 --> 27:14.360
- I know it's because his dad molested him.
- What?

27:14.361 --> 27:16.728
- What?
- Now everybody knows!

27:16.729 --> 27:18.031
He was a boy scout leader.

27:18.032 --> 27:20.900
- Yeah.
- Bro, you're welcome. You're welcome.

27:20.901 --> 27:23.135
- How am I welcome?
- I just set that up for you.

27:23.136 --> 27:25.271
- Wait a minute, where is she going?
- Yeah, don't let her get away.

27:25.272 --> 27:28.006
Dude, you gotta chase after her.

27:28.007 --> 27:31.075
- She's your lobster, man.
- I know. Okay, alright.

27:31.077 --> 27:33.211
She seems...

27:33.212 --> 27:34.313
- Awesome.
- Amazing.

27:34.314 --> 27:37.149
Hey, Lainey!

27:37.150 --> 27:40.084
- What are you doin'? Where are you going?
- Sorry, sorry, yeah.

27:40.086 --> 27:42.921
I just... I wanna thank you
for tonight. It was great.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.890
Just go... go in and have
fun with your friends.

27:45.891 --> 27:48.760
I just... I Facebooked
you because I thought...

27:48.761 --> 27:50.763
I should start dating again, I'm
trying to get over this guy...

27:50.764 --> 27:52.488
Was this supposed to be a date?

27:54.101 --> 27:56.168
Oh shit, it was...

27:56.169 --> 27:59.304
Oh hell. I'm an idiot,
I'm sorry, I'm a dick.

27:59.305 --> 28:01.907
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't know. I...

28:01.908 --> 28:03.175
Well, hey... hey, how
about we go on a date?

28:03.176 --> 28:05.044
This is a date now. We'll go out.

28:05.045 --> 28:07.112
- So now it's...
- Yeah, it's a date. Let's go on a date.

28:07.113 --> 28:09.915
This is good. I'll go inside,
I'm gonna get my jacket

28:09.916 --> 28:13.986
then I'll come out and
we'll, uh... date it up.

28:13.987 --> 28:17.957
<i>Matthew Sobvechik? That guy had all
the charm of a broken Etch a sketch.</i>

28:17.958 --> 28:21.494
It feels so freeing to tell someone
about it. Who actually knows him.

28:21.495 --> 28:24.764
Okay, you're gonna have to explain
this to me. I mean, is he packing? Huh?

28:24.765 --> 28:26.931
Is that what's going on?
Does it tip in hundreds?

28:26.932 --> 28:28.801
Read you the Polar Express before bedtime?

28:28.802 --> 28:30.768
You know, it's pretty average actually.

28:30.770 --> 28:34.106
Ah, Goddammit! Even his junk is boring.

28:34.107 --> 28:37.110
God damn boring dick!

28:37.111 --> 28:40.012
That's so weird, and
you're a catch! It's true.

28:40.013 --> 28:43.015
You know, I'm serious. You've
got a strong vocabulary.

28:43.016 --> 28:46.307
You look dynamite in a tank
top. It's just... what gives?

28:46.754 --> 28:47.842
I guess...

28:50.957 --> 28:54.959
I guess, I just thought
eventually he'd choose me.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.830
- Mm-hmm.
- And so I always chose him.

28:57.831 --> 29:00.999
If he texted I'd think of
an excuse. I'd lie, I'd...

29:01.000 --> 29:04.003
- That's psychotic.
- Mm. Thanks.

29:04.004 --> 29:05.970
Well, I mean it's not your fault.

29:05.971 --> 29:07.907
You know, little girls are told

29:07.908 --> 29:10.176
that someday they're gonna find the one.

29:10.177 --> 29:11.811
What they don't tell
you guys is that the one

29:11.812 --> 29:13.079
might be a complete fucking dickhead

29:13.080 --> 29:15.948
with a boring heroin penis that
turns you all into a sex addict

29:15.949 --> 29:17.016
that's what they leave
out in the Disney movies...

29:17.017 --> 29:18.217
I'm not sex addict.

29:18.218 --> 29:19.317
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Me neither.

29:19.318 --> 29:20.419
I went to a few meetings

29:20.420 --> 29:21.986
because my therapist suggested

29:21.987 --> 29:24.055
that I go, that it... that it might help.

29:24.056 --> 29:26.524
- But it didn't, so I stopped.
- Okay.

29:26.525 --> 29:28.259
What's your excuse?

29:28.260 --> 29:29.829
- Me?
- Yeah.

29:29.830 --> 29:30.862
My girlfriend said if I didn't go

29:30.863 --> 29:31.930
she'd break up with me.

29:31.931 --> 29:33.099
So I went to a meeting.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.793
She broke up with me anyway. I'm cured.

29:35.794 --> 29:38.317
- Well why did she want you to go?
- I don't know.

29:42.542 --> 29:46.512
She... some have suggested

29:46.513 --> 29:50.048
that I have a little bit of
a problem staying faithful

29:50.049 --> 29:53.352
for long periods of
time... Or possibly at all.

29:53.353 --> 29:56.455
Oh. And it all comes out.

29:56.456 --> 30:01.193
Look, once I come to the
realization that I'm with...

30:01.194 --> 30:02.527
...the wrong girl...

30:02.528 --> 30:04.563
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know how to end it.

30:04.564 --> 30:08.399
- So you sabotage it by sleeping with other people?
- Mm. Exactly.

30:08.401 --> 30:11.469
Yeah. Obviously they get upset

30:11.470 --> 30:14.606
but then comes the whole rigmarole
of, like, "You're afraid to commit"

30:14.607 --> 30:17.476
and it's like "No, I just
don't wanna commit to you."

30:17.477 --> 30:20.044
But I can't say that, because
that's, like, mean on top of mean.

30:20.045 --> 30:22.014
You know, so it's "No, no,
no. It's not you, it's me.

30:22.015 --> 30:25.284
I don't like you."

30:25.285 --> 30:27.186
- You know, like that.
- Yeah, that's harsh.

30:27.187 --> 30:28.888
- That's harsh, right You can't say that.
- That's pretty harsh.

30:28.889 --> 30:31.524
So instead I'd rather
just say something like...

30:31.525 --> 30:32.891
"I fucked your sister."

30:32.892 --> 30:35.460
- Much better.
- Well, it's honest.

30:35.461 --> 30:38.063
You have to fuck the sister
in order for it to work.

30:38.065 --> 30:40.064
- It's like I'd rather...
- Be the bad guy than tell the truth.

30:40.065 --> 30:43.357
- See. You get it.
- Oh, yeah. But I'm psychotic.

30:45.305 --> 30:47.473
But like an approachable psychotic.

30:47.474 --> 30:50.074
- That's the thing I don't think I mentioned earlier.
- You like it?

30:50.076 --> 30:52.378
Yeah, it's like... it's
like Ted Bundy, you know.

30:52.379 --> 30:54.979
You can't get him into a
van by just being a jerk.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.181
You've got to have a certain...

30:56.182 --> 30:58.350
...way about you.

30:58.351 --> 31:00.919
- Appetite?
- That would be... that would be something.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.189
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I'm hungry again.

31:03.190 --> 31:05.056
Already?

31:05.057 --> 31:07.959
Well, you know, that's Dim Sum for you.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.128
- I have snacks... I have snacks at home.
- Yeah.

31:09.129 --> 31:11.596
I have, uh, this is
actually... This is my train.

31:11.597 --> 31:12.965
- What here? Oh, yeah, yeah.
- So...

31:12.966 --> 31:14.300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Alright.

31:14.301 --> 31:16.267
So, I'll probably gonna hit the road.

31:16.268 --> 31:18.670
- Yeah.
- Jake, thank you.

31:18.671 --> 31:20.973
- Yeah.
- Oh.

31:20.974 --> 31:23.575
Hey, this was a... We did
it. That was a good date.

31:23.576 --> 31:26.312
- We did the date.
- You know, I think it was the first...

31:26.313 --> 31:27.979
I think it might have been the
first date I've ever been on

31:27.980 --> 31:29.114
so I don't really have
much to compare it to

31:29.115 --> 31:30.381
but, you know, it seemed solid.

31:30.382 --> 31:31.417
- Good.
- Yeah.

31:31.418 --> 31:33.651
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:33.652 --> 31:35.220
Shit.

31:35.221 --> 31:37.523
What?

31:37.524 --> 31:40.081
I, uh, I want to fuck you.

31:40.526 --> 31:41.659
- What?
- I know.

31:41.660 --> 31:43.362
- No!
- What do you mean no?

31:43.363 --> 31:46.297
What? What? What did I do?

31:46.298 --> 31:47.932
- Stop wanting to.
- I mean, are you kidding me?

31:47.933 --> 31:49.468
It's kinda hard. I mean, look at you.

31:49.469 --> 31:51.704
I mean, you're so pretty
and you're vulnerable

31:51.705 --> 31:53.538
and it's just like you might as
well be wearing a sign that says

31:53.539 --> 31:54.672
"Solve my problems with your penis, Jake."

31:54.673 --> 31:57.275
Jake, we just spent the
entire evening talking about

31:57.276 --> 31:59.644
how we screw up every sexual
relationship we've ever have.

31:59.645 --> 32:03.716
I know, I... I right. I mean, and yet
here I am like wanting... just now.

32:03.717 --> 32:06.352
So, maybe... we gotta just be friends.

32:06.353 --> 32:10.588
Yes, that is the mature,
responsible thing to do, uh...

32:10.589 --> 32:12.991
...for each other and
ourselves, yes I agree.

32:12.992 --> 32:14.592
Okay, but then we've got
to come up with a system.

32:14.593 --> 32:16.161
- If we're gonna be friends, you know...
- Okay.

32:16.162 --> 32:17.996
- And I want to be good friends...
- It's fair.

32:17.997 --> 32:22.066
So, maybe we come up with a safe word

32:22.068 --> 32:24.335
for if we're having sexual tension
and then we'll stop whatever...

32:24.336 --> 32:25.404
So, if you're doing something
sexy or I'm doing something sexy.

32:25.405 --> 32:27.672
- Or feeling attracted.
- Okay, but it's mutual?

32:27.673 --> 32:29.007
- So it is mutual?
- The word.

32:29.008 --> 32:30.375
You're saying it's mutual?

32:30.376 --> 32:32.343
- It could be mutual.
- That's a yes.

32:32.344 --> 32:34.279
- I may or may not need to use the word.
- That's a yes.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.414
- We'll have to see in the future...
- Hmm. Okay, alright.

32:35.415 --> 32:37.550
Well, let's... well, alright.
Say, uh, say it for me.

32:37.551 --> 32:38.685
- Uh, yeah. Anything.
- Let's go, come up with one. What you got.

32:38.686 --> 32:40.986
I'll do anything. What do
you... You pick it, and yes.

32:40.987 --> 32:42.487
- It's Avocado.
- No. Can't do that.

32:42.488 --> 32:45.224
- No. It's an immediate veto?
- No, no, no.

32:45.225 --> 32:47.025
Well, I mean, it's too
sexual. It's too sexual. Uh...

32:47.026 --> 32:49.327
- "Avocado" is too sexual?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:49.328 --> 32:51.996
I mean... I mean you've got to see the
way I eat an avocado and you'll be like...

32:51.997 --> 32:53.666
That's like... You know, do that to me.

32:53.667 --> 32:57.236
- It's like Guam.
- Guam? Like the country Guam? No!

32:57.237 --> 32:59.337
No, I knew a girl whose
father was from Guam

32:59.338 --> 33:01.439
and she literally had one
of the best natural bodies

33:01.440 --> 33:02.341
I've ever seen in my life.

33:02.342 --> 33:03.640
Noodle salad.

33:03.641 --> 33:05.176
"Noodle salad?" that's a sex thing.

33:05.177 --> 33:06.276
- That's a... that's...
- What?

- And then there will be plenty of room.
- A whole thing.

42:35.980 --> 42:37.915
Bye.

42:37.916 --> 42:40.218
Car seat? We already have a kid?

42:40.219 --> 42:42.619
You know, it's just
like... When do you orgasm?

42:42.620 --> 42:43.656
You know what, when does it happen to you?

42:43.657 --> 42:46.624
- When I'm with Matthew.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

42:46.625 --> 42:47.715
That's it.

42:48.927 --> 42:50.894
That's it?

42:50.895 --> 42:52.663
Okay, well, that just explained everything.

42:52.664 --> 42:56.835
That... that's... I mean you
haven't had an orgasm in a year.

42:56.836 --> 43:00.104
<i>Come on, that's bullshit.
Not even when you masturbate?</i>

43:00.106 --> 43:02.239
<i>Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!</i>

43:02.240 --> 43:04.308
What you don't mastur... Why not?

43:04.309 --> 43:07.212
What... I don't kno...
I mean, I've tried to!

43:07.213 --> 43:10.616
I try. I just, I don't know, I... I...

43:10.617 --> 43:12.282
- I get bored.
- Bored?

43:12.283 --> 43:15.019
- But I feel good when I'm with Matthew.
- How's that boring?

43:15.020 --> 43:17.188
I don't... I don't know. I don't
know how to recreate that myself.

43:17.189 --> 43:19.625
Okay. Well, fuck the TV.

43:19.626 --> 43:21.024
I'm gonna teach you how
to finger yourself today.

43:21.025 --> 43:23.060
Right now, okay?

43:23.061 --> 43:26.131
- What?
- It's... it's go time, sister.

43:26.132 --> 43:28.899
- Alright. Let's go. Alright.
- Okay.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.067
- No, no. This is a good thing.
- Oh, boy.

43:30.068 --> 43:31.335
It's about time. Get it out.

43:31.336 --> 43:32.669
- Okay.
- I'm excited.

43:32.670 --> 43:34.739
For the purposes of today's tutorial

43:34.740 --> 43:36.741
your vagina will be played by this

43:36.742 --> 43:38.843
former bottle of green tea.

43:38.844 --> 43:40.344
- Looks just like it.
- Okay. Good to know.

43:40.345 --> 43:41.311
So, here's what we do.

43:41.312 --> 43:43.680
First thing, you take, uh, take this guy...

43:43.681 --> 43:45.716
...this, uh, index finger
and you're gonna just, uh

43:45.717 --> 43:47.684
slide in there... like that, okay?

43:47.685 --> 43:48.654
And you're gonna curve it up a little bit

43:48.655 --> 43:50.922
and I want you to tap the roof like that.

43:50.923 --> 43:53.323
You see that? That's your G
Spot alright, you got that?

43:53.324 --> 43:54.859
- Yeah. I'll check it out.
- Okay, good.

43:54.860 --> 43:56.661
Alright, now, next move,
alright, you're gonna take

43:56.662 --> 43:58.663
the middle finger here, alright?
And you know, the bad boy, right?

43:58.664 --> 44:00.265
You're gonna have to pop that in as well

44:00.266 --> 44:01.832
and you're gonna have
that one tapping the roof

44:01.833 --> 44:04.201
and then this one, the
middle finger is going to be

44:04.202 --> 44:07.672
you know, sort of circling, uh,
this, uh, just like fleshy gap area.

44:07.673 --> 44:09.706
- My cervix? Jesus.
- Yeah, sure.

44:09.707 --> 44:12.009
Okay, y-you know what it's
called. Wonderful. Good for you.

44:12.010 --> 44:13.878
Okay, yes, so you're gonna
go after the cervix here.

44:13.879 --> 44:16.214
So you're gonna mind the
gap, right, tap the roof.

44:16.215 --> 44:19.451
- "Mind the gap. Tap the roof."
- You got it.

44:19.452 --> 44:21.953
Alright, now, at this point you wanna start
thinking about something, uh, arousing.

44:21.954 --> 44:23.788
You know, like, uh, maybe
you wanna think about

44:23.789 --> 44:25.690
the guy you lost your virginity to perhaps.

44:25.691 --> 44:27.426
- Gross.
- Okay, and then you're gonna start to get wet.

44:27.427 --> 44:28.460
You're gonna start to get wet

44:28.461 --> 44:30.861
and then you're gonna
start to feel some, uh...

44:30.862 --> 44:32.896
...contractions in your vagina, alright?

44:32.897 --> 44:35.232
At that point you're gonna
wanna squeeze your vagina harder

44:35.233 --> 44:37.435
than it wants to go, okay.

44:37.436 --> 44:39.471
- And that's called...
- Kegeling.

44:39.472 --> 44:41.806
Well, it's pronounced
"Kee-gul-ing," but it doesn't matter.

44:41.807 --> 44:42.940
Uh, I got into med school!

44:42.941 --> 44:45.276
I think I know how it's pronounced.

44:45.277 --> 44:47.145
What? You did? You didn't tell me that.

44:47.146 --> 44:49.246
Oh yeah. I got in, uh, Michigan.

44:49.247 --> 44:52.984
- Wow! Lane, that's great.
- I know.

44:52.985 --> 44:55.120
Alright.

44:55.121 --> 44:57.921
Well, uh, are you... I mean, are
you gonna go? What are you thinking?

44:57.922 --> 45:00.058
Well, I... I mean, I have until
the end of the summer to decide.

45:00.059 --> 45:01.225
- So, I just...
- Mm-hmm.

45:01.226 --> 45:03.428
- Keep going!
- Oh, right. Yeah, um...

45:03.429 --> 45:05.429
Okay, yeah, da, da, da. Okay, let's see.

45:05.430 --> 45:07.866
So, uh, do you know what a dirty DJ is?

45:07.867 --> 45:09.399
- No.
- You don't? Okay, great.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.769
Okay, so the biggest
misconception that guys

45:11.771 --> 45:14.071
have about the clitoris,
uh, if they can find it

45:14.072 --> 45:16.039
- is that they're too nice to it. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

45:16.040 --> 45:17.076
Like... that's the problem.

45:17.077 --> 45:19.810
I mean, you know, the
trick is to be a little

45:19.811 --> 45:20.945
rude to the clitoris, okay?

45:20.946 --> 45:22.080
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

45:22.081 --> 45:24.815
Just go to town on this
little motherfucker right here.

45:24.816 --> 45:25.917
You just... like you
just... Tweet, tweet, tweet.

45:25.918 --> 45:27.118
You know, so that's the dirty DJ.

45:27.119 --> 45:28.419
You know, like you're scratching
a record. You know, this...

45:28.421 --> 45:30.844
Tweet tweet tweet.

45:31.523 --> 45:33.024
Let... let... let the drummer...

45:33.025 --> 45:35.893
Let... let... let the
drummer get wicked, right?

45:35.894 --> 45:37.261
And you just really wanna
work that little bugger.

45:37.262 --> 45:39.464
You know, remember like
the old IBM ThinkPads?

45:39.465 --> 45:41.199
- Mm-hmm.
- And that little nub. Right?

45:41.200 --> 45:43.100
Okay, so you just really
go after it like that.

45:43.101 --> 45:44.368
- Just like this. Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:44.369 --> 45:47.338
Right, so, uh, you have that
that's... that's phase three.

45:47.339 --> 45:49.841
- Mm-hmm.
- So, again, you know... Yeah, perfect.

45:49.842 --> 45:52.042
- Natural. Okay? Yeah, so tap the roof.
- I know.

45:52.043 --> 45:54.379
Mind the gap. Oh, see.
Okay, yeah. Work all three.

45:54.380 --> 45:56.413
- He's there.
- Look at that. It's like you're doing...

45:56.414 --> 45:58.015
- Right there.
- Oh boy, oh boy.

45:58.016 --> 46:01.118
It's like, I feel like
Anne Sullivan teaching

46:01.119 --> 46:03.154
Helen Keller about water and
everything else is amazing.

46:03.155 --> 46:04.321
- What a breakthrough!
- Mm-hmm.

46:04.322 --> 46:05.356
- Yeah, that's it.
- Like that?

46:05.357 --> 46:06.857
Yeah, you know, just take a night

46:06.858 --> 46:09.928
crack open a bottle of rose and...

46:09.929 --> 46:12.496
...just have multiple orgasms.

46:12.497 --> 46:15.590
If you want, you know... You know...

46:19.137 --> 46:21.506
Uh, primatologists actually
believed that... that

46:21.507 --> 46:26.111
women evolved this way so that, uh...

46:26.112 --> 46:29.435
...they could mate with as many
men in one session as possible.

46:30.483 --> 46:32.417
- Fucking awesome. You know that's...
- Yeah.

46:32.418 --> 46:36.154
- That's neat.
- Multiple orgasms for multiple partners, you know.

46:36.155 --> 46:38.256
Sure, yeah.

46:38.257 --> 46:41.124
Gang bangs, and such.

46:41.126 --> 46:42.616
Yeah.

46:44.963 --> 46:47.065
- I'm gonna go home.
- Yeah. Me too.

46:47.066 --> 46:48.899
- No, no. You live here.
- Yes I do!

46:48.900 --> 46:49.934
- Okay.
- Bye!

46:49.935 --> 46:51.002
- Bye now.
- Thank you.

46:51.003 --> 46:52.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:55.273 --> 46:57.107
<i>I think... I think
it's a little bit weird</i>

46:57.108 --> 46:58.309
<i>that a straight dude had
to tell you all that.</i>

46:58.310 --> 47:00.511
I think it's sort of great.

47:00.512 --> 47:02.881
I mean, he's... he's actually
dating. He's not cheating.

47:02.882 --> 47:05.449
And I... and I hardly think
about Matthew. Like ever.

47:05.450 --> 47:07.352
Yeah, 'cause you're in a
relationship with each other.

47:07.353 --> 47:09.220
No, we're not.

47:09.221 --> 47:10.855
Oh, you're not out there!

47:10.856 --> 47:13.257
I mean, this Jake guy
is taking up emotional

47:13.258 --> 47:16.227
real estate that could be
occupied by a real option, okay?

47:16.228 --> 47:17.562
You leased the space out to Matthew.

47:17.563 --> 47:19.297
Rent free I might add.

47:19.298 --> 47:21.565
And now, you... you just
replaced him with another

47:21.566 --> 47:25.136
unavailable avoidant
breeder you don't fuck.

47:25.137 --> 47:28.172
- Like where's the fucking...
- Hey babe. Sorry, I'm late.

47:28.173 --> 47:29.540
Look at this little baby face.

47:29.541 --> 47:31.509
It's beautiful. Oh, my God.

47:31.510 --> 47:33.244
Very sick in the head though.

47:33.245 --> 47:35.112
Very sick in the head.

47:35.113 --> 47:37.915
- How's your fake boyfriend?
- Oh, my God!

47:37.916 --> 47:40.885
- We're just friends!
- Men and women can't be friends.

47:40.886 --> 47:42.253
It's like life 101. Stop lying to yourself.

47:42.254 --> 47:45.323
Come one! That's bullshit.
It's the 21st century.

47:45.324 --> 47:47.591
We know that's not true.
You and I are friends.

47:47.592 --> 47:50.161
But sex doesn't get in
the way of our friendship.

47:50.162 --> 47:52.429
I'm not attracted to you.
And I have zero penises.

47:52.430 --> 47:55.365
- I am.
- Hi, George.

47:55.366 --> 47:57.435
- Hi, it's me. Your girlfriend.
- What? Oh!

47:57.436 --> 47:59.170
I like bad girls with daddy issues.

47:59.171 --> 48:00.971
She's 22, she'll fuck anyone.

48:00.972 --> 48:02.907
- Wait. I'm sorry, no.
- You know.

48:02.908 --> 48:05.999
Serious, she's probably fucked
everyone in here but I don't even care.

48:09.381 --> 48:11.116
You got a minute?

48:11.117 --> 48:13.906
Not really. I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

48:14.652 --> 48:17.021
- I was thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

48:17.022 --> 48:19.946
Do you wanna come to Henry's
birthday party this weekend?

48:20.658 --> 48:22.594
- Really?
- <i>Yep.</i>

48:22.595 --> 48:24.495
Xander, in the 8 years
I've known you as a father

48:24.496 --> 48:27.598
you have never once invited me to
any function involving your children.

48:27.599 --> 48:30.133
- Hear me out. I was thinking.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

48:30.135 --> 48:32.202
Maybe you and Lainey...

48:32.203 --> 48:35.239
Ah, I knew it! No. See,
Lainey and I are not dating.

48:35.240 --> 48:37.641
I know that. I'm not
saying you have to date her.

48:37.642 --> 48:39.209
I'm not saying you have
to come as a couple.

48:39.210 --> 48:42.212
I'm just saying arrive
at the party together.

48:42.213 --> 48:44.549
Come as friends or whatever this
fucked up thing you guys have...

48:44.550 --> 48:46.984
- We're... we're best friends.
- <i>No, we're best friends!</i>

48:46.985 --> 48:49.286
- That's not true.
- <i>What?</i>

48:49.287 --> 48:51.689
Look, she's my best friend and I would say

48:51.690 --> 48:53.691
by circumstance and certainly duration

48:53.692 --> 48:55.393
you would be my next best friend.

48:55.394 --> 48:57.995
Okay, you know what, I'll even allow that.

48:57.996 --> 49:02.000
- You're my last single friend, I can't have you...
- So what?

49:02.001 --> 49:03.100
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

49:03.101 --> 49:05.536
- Yes.
- We have a meeting with group sales in 20.

49:05.537 --> 49:06.370
- Are you two prepared.
- Huh?

49:06.371 --> 49:07.604
Not at all.

49:07.605 --> 49:09.974
Should I reschedule the meeting

49:09.975 --> 49:11.643
when you are ready? 5 or 6 months from now?

49:11.644 --> 49:13.545
I would make it a cool 7.

49:13.546 --> 49:15.279
Yeah, 7 at least.

49:15.280 --> 49:18.049
Shit, I'm not available
then. Oh, well, I tried.

49:18.050 --> 49:19.484
See you in 20?

49:19.485 --> 49:21.084
You got it, boss.

49:21.085 --> 49:24.354
- Oh, yeah. Mousetrap
- What the fuck is that?

49:24.355 --> 49:27.424
- That was repartee.
- That's... that's exactly why I can't have you at the party.

49:27.425 --> 49:29.294
Because you have repartee with everybody.

49:29.295 --> 49:31.129
You love repartee.

49:31.130 --> 49:33.330
All you want to do is flit around the party

49:33.331 --> 49:35.264
flirt with the moms.

49:35.265 --> 49:38.001
<i>And then they all get mad, and
then they turn on each other.</i>

49:38.002 --> 49:41.071
Then they yell at Naomi,
then Naomi yells at me.

49:41.072 --> 49:43.374
Then they won't let their
kids play with my kids.

49:43.375 --> 49:46.276
Then I have to play with my kids
because my kids have no friends.

49:46.277 --> 49:49.246
I'm raising friendless
children because of you.

49:49.247 --> 49:50.381
- Do you understand?
- <i>I...</i>

49:50.382 --> 49:54.017
It is a cascading shit
storm that is your creation.

49:54.018 --> 49:57.589
A tremendous amount of Malcolm
Gladwellian logic jumps.

49:57.590 --> 50:01.625
We'll you've spent 10,000
hours fucking my life up.

50:01.626 --> 50:04.129
- <i>So bring Lainey to the party.</i>
- Okay. Fine.

50:04.130 --> 50:07.197
I will, uh, you know, on
behalf of your children and...

50:07.198 --> 50:09.167
...and Naomi, I will, uh...

50:09.168 --> 50:10.335
I'll talk to Lainey and see what we can do.

50:10.336 --> 50:14.137
Listen, I'm not saying you
and Lainey need to date.

50:14.139 --> 50:16.540
I'm just saying, for the first time

50:16.541 --> 50:18.664
I'm a little bit optimistic...

50:19.412 --> 50:22.169
...you might not become that creepy guy.

50:22.580 --> 50:24.048
But he's got a point.

50:24.049 --> 50:26.149
I'm gonna be the creepy old dude!

50:26.151 --> 50:28.353
Like, that's sucks and then what happens

50:28.354 --> 50:30.522
when my dick doesn't get
as hard as it used to, okay.

50:30.523 --> 50:32.789
'Cause that's gonna happen. It's
gonna happen, it's inevitable.

50:32.791 --> 50:34.525
And... and young chicks
don't put up with that shit

50:34.526 --> 50:36.194
they have no time for that.

I can hear my mom's
voice when I'm underwater.

01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:21.410
Oh, that's... It is good stuff.

01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:23.146
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:00:23.148 --> 01:00:24.982
I'm Chris. This is Paul.

01:00:24.983 --> 01:00:26.782
Lainey. Jake.

01:00:26.783 --> 01:00:30.286
Ah, hi, you two. Are you guys married?

01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:33.757
This is my son, and he really liked
dancing with you. Didn't you, buddy?

01:00:33.758 --> 01:00:36.027
Dude, are you really using
your kid to hit on my friend?

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:38.094
Shut up. Ignore him. He's on drugs.

01:00:38.095 --> 01:00:40.297
Paul, nice to meet you.

01:00:40.298 --> 01:00:42.899
We're headin' out. But here's my info.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.002
In case you feel like you might need it.

01:00:45.003 --> 01:00:46.837
Come on, buddy. You can drive.

01:00:46.838 --> 01:00:49.272
Oh, boy, "In case you might need it?"

01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:51.974
Why would you need his info?

01:00:51.975 --> 01:00:54.343
You're jealous.

01:00:54.344 --> 01:00:56.112
I'm going to assume it's
because you're coming down

01:00:56.113 --> 01:00:57.713
off a powerful drug.

01:00:57.714 --> 01:00:59.149
First part, false. Second part, true.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.750
"Chris Smith."

01:01:00.751 --> 01:01:02.053
Hold on. What?

01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:04.689
His name's Chris Smith?

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.323
It is?

01:01:06.324 --> 01:01:09.160
As in Chris Smith tree?

01:01:09.161 --> 01:01:10.428
As in Chris Smith carol?

01:01:10.429 --> 01:01:13.262
- No.
- Holy smokes!

01:01:13.263 --> 01:01:15.199
I always thought he'd
be heavier with a beard.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.333
- Leave him alone.
- I love it. It's great.

01:01:17.334 --> 01:01:18.868
Okay, I'm gonna try it again, alright?

01:01:18.869 --> 01:01:20.369
Just see if any of the water goes down.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.794
I'm gonna see how much
I can drink. Here we go.

01:01:27.878 --> 01:01:30.448
I love those "Rush
Hour" movies. Oh, my God.

01:01:30.449 --> 01:01:32.749
Anything that African American guy says

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.317
anything at all and I'm laughing, you know.

01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:37.087
Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:01:37.088 --> 01:01:40.389
- Shit, that was dumb.
- No, Chris. It's fine.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.392
They're great. They're such good movies.

01:01:42.393 --> 01:01:44.462
I was married for 8 years.

01:01:44.463 --> 01:01:48.755
And I just... I haven't
done this in a while.

01:01:49.367 --> 01:01:51.658
Me neither.

01:01:52.804 --> 01:01:54.137
Are you okay?

01:01:54.139 --> 01:01:56.806
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:56.807 --> 01:01:58.632
[moans]

01:02:05.117 --> 01:02:06.605
Yeah.

01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:09.942
Be rude to it.

01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:15.648
Yeah.

01:02:16.227 --> 01:02:19.685
[upbeat music]

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:22.755
[laughing]

01:02:24.168 --> 01:02:26.792
That was ridiculous.

01:02:28.907 --> 01:02:32.109
The Dirty DJ was our thing, okay?

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:33.277
- Jake.
- That was our thing.

01:02:33.278 --> 01:02:35.111
Okay, let me be super clear here.

01:02:35.112 --> 01:02:36.547
Mm-hmm. Please.

01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:39.482
We don't have things that are sexual.

01:02:39.483 --> 01:02:44.053
We don't sleep with each
other, so we don't have things.

01:02:44.054 --> 01:02:46.790
Okay, but you know what I mean, alright?

01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.258
I taught you that as a gift to you.

01:02:49.259 --> 01:02:52.562
That was not a Chris Smith gift, okay?

01:02:52.563 --> 01:02:54.531
So. I don't get mad when you bring
other chicks to our restaurant.

01:02:54.532 --> 01:02:56.500
- Our restaurant?
- Yes.

01:02:56.501 --> 01:02:59.102
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Our restaurant?

01:02:59.103 --> 01:03:01.003
I didn't know we put a
down payment on this place.

01:03:01.004 --> 01:03:02.372
Come on.

01:03:02.373 --> 01:03:04.040
You know, I love it that you get ownership

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:06.210
over a randomly selected dumpling spot

01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:09.845
but me, I can't share with you
the slightest disappointment

01:03:09.847 --> 01:03:11.481
over you co-opting an
original idea of mine.

01:03:11.483 --> 01:03:12.515
- Co... Okay.
- Yeah.

01:03:12.516 --> 01:03:13.550
First of all, you are not

01:03:13.551 --> 01:03:15.552
the Mark Zuckerberg of vaginas.

01:03:15.553 --> 01:03:16.620
I don't know who that is.

01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:20.591
And secondly, do not
gaslight me with SAT words

01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:22.559
and sliding scale morality.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.361
- I'm not one of your dates.
- That is very true.

01:03:24.362 --> 01:03:25.596
No. You are not one of my dates.

01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:26.596
- And I'm glad. Thank you.
- Some water.

01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:27.832
- No, the lady doesn't need it.
- Excuse me.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:29.566
- She doesn't deserve that.
- I would like that, please.

01:03:29.567 --> 01:03:30.600
I actually would like the water.

01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.870
Sir, I-I can't stress enough

01:03:32.871 --> 01:03:34.103
if we give her water I
don't know what happens.

01:03:34.104 --> 01:03:35.037
You need to give me this water.

01:03:35.038 --> 01:03:37.540
See she's addicted. This is an addict.

01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:39.575
This is... I've seen it
a hundred times with her.

01:03:39.576 --> 01:03:41.410
You gotta trust me.

01:03:41.411 --> 01:03:43.112
You have lost your mind.

01:03:43.113 --> 01:03:46.015
Well, you have lost your water.

01:03:46.016 --> 01:03:49.074
So... I guess we're tied.

01:03:50.487 --> 01:03:52.890
I wanna be able to talk
you about this kinda thing.

01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:55.192
I sense that. That's obvious.
I just don't know why.

01:03:55.193 --> 01:03:57.361
You talk to me about chicks
you screw all the time.

01:03:57.362 --> 01:03:59.618
That's different.

01:04:00.964 --> 01:04:03.033
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm going inside them.

01:04:03.034 --> 01:04:04.368
This you're talking
about someone inside you

01:04:04.369 --> 01:04:05.902
that's just... ugh!

01:04:05.903 --> 01:04:06.993
- Duh.
- Grody.

01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:13.175
This is the Bieder contract that
has to go to legal for comments.

01:04:13.177 --> 01:04:15.545
Knock knock. Hey, you got a minute?

01:04:15.546 --> 01:04:19.149
Um... Ah, I mean... real minute?

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.349
A New York minute. I don't
know... yeah, a real minute.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.018
60 seconds. Sure.

01:04:22.019 --> 01:04:23.520
Okay.

01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:25.454
Um, what was the other thing?

01:04:25.455 --> 01:04:26.957
Oh, yeah, buzz me for the 3 o'clock.

01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.058
<i>And that's it. Okay.</i>

01:04:28.059 --> 01:04:30.083
Yeah, don't fuck that up.

01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:32.529
You got to let them have it.

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.964
Hey, will you, uh, sign this for me please?

01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:36.265
Well, I have to know what it is first.

01:04:36.266 --> 01:04:38.935
Oh, it's a nullification of my contract.

01:04:38.936 --> 01:04:43.472
It says I resign and forfeit any
vesting stock options to Xander.

01:04:43.473 --> 01:04:46.410
And why would you do that?

01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:49.078
Oh, right, no. Because I
want to go on a date with you.

01:04:49.079 --> 01:04:52.648
Silly. Uh, if you can just
sign the back here. 3 places.

01:04:52.649 --> 01:04:54.117
You can use my pen if you'd like.

01:04:54.119 --> 01:04:57.254
And as you can see I've
executed my half, so...

01:04:57.255 --> 01:05:00.023
You stand to make over $5
million in the next 2 years.

01:05:00.024 --> 01:05:03.492
No shit? Wow! That's great.

01:05:03.494 --> 01:05:05.494
Uh, but I mean I never really factor

01:05:05.496 --> 01:05:07.598
money in my decision making, so...

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.032
...it doesn't change what I'm doing.

01:05:09.033 --> 01:05:10.234
I appreciate the hardball

01:05:10.235 --> 01:05:13.569
but obviously I can't take a
request like this seriously.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:14.671
But the seriousness of my request

01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:17.207
is reflected in the hardball.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.098
So I don't... I don't know what to do here.

01:05:21.211 --> 01:05:22.868
[chuckles]

01:05:24.081 --> 01:05:25.314
Okay. I'll go on one date with you

01:05:25.315 --> 01:05:27.250
if you answer a question truthfully.

01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:29.085
Get the spanks. I love it. Yeah.

01:05:29.086 --> 01:05:32.689
I answer all questions
truthfully, but fire away.

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:36.959
What on earth makes you think
that I'm worth $5 million?

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.652
What makes you think you're not?

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:42.855
[instrumental music]

01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:46.236
Get outta here. Get back to work.

01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:47.471
- I'm on break.
- So take this...

01:05:47.472 --> 01:05:49.506
- I'm on break.
- ...and get out of my office.

01:05:49.507 --> 01:05:51.096
Okay.

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.066
Alright. To be continued.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.768
TTFN.

01:05:57.514 --> 01:06:00.283
<i>Um, you know, I mean...</i>

01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:02.051
Ta-ta for now.

01:06:02.052 --> 01:06:05.022
My ex has my son this weekend.

01:06:05.023 --> 01:06:07.491
And I know a place with cheap tequila.

01:06:07.492 --> 01:06:09.692
We should go there. That sounds great.

01:06:09.693 --> 01:06:12.129
Can you keep your mouth shut?

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.363
Yeah. I mean, not once we get there.

01:06:14.364 --> 01:06:16.099
Tequila makes me so chatty.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.067
In a good way I think.

01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:20.536
- You mean out here.
- <i>Just... Yes, mouth shut, please.</i>

01:06:20.537 --> 01:06:23.129
- Not gonna say a peep.
- Get outta here!

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:27.642
Back to work, you.

01:06:27.643 --> 01:06:29.134
<i>Yes!</i>

01:06:31.782 --> 01:06:34.017
<i>There you are.</i>

01:06:34.018 --> 01:06:35.786
Hey, thanks for comin', Lainey.

01:06:35.787 --> 01:06:38.653
Partners always have to
do these bullshit events.

01:06:38.654 --> 01:06:40.122
I hope your heels are comfortable

01:06:40.123 --> 01:06:41.023
'cause you're gonna be standing

01:06:41.024 --> 01:06:43.460
and talking to boring people all night.

01:06:43.461 --> 01:06:45.462
Chris, I'm having a great time.

01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:47.330
Thank you for inviting me.

01:06:47.331 --> 01:06:49.888
And these shoes are still uncomfortable.

01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:53.024
<i>Elaine?</i>

01:06:53.438 --> 01:06:55.071
Hi, Matthew.

01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:57.506
- Good to see you.
- This is Chris.

01:06:57.508 --> 01:06:59.508
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Matthew.

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:02.111
Matthew and I were at
Columbia around the same time.

01:07:02.112 --> 01:07:05.148
Oh. Your name is Elaine?

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.718
- Lainey is a nickname.
- I didn't know that.

01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:11.120
Oh, Elaine, you've never
met my wife, have you?

01:07:11.121 --> 01:07:13.257
- I haven't.
- Let me introduce you. Emma?

01:07:13.258 --> 01:07:16.292
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

01:07:16.293 --> 01:07:17.728
This is Elaine.

01:07:17.729 --> 01:07:19.462
So nice to meet you, Emma.

01:07:19.463 --> 01:07:20.663
- This is Chris.
- Hi.

01:07:20.664 --> 01:07:22.598
- Hi.
- When are you due?

01:07:22.599 --> 01:07:25.201
- October.
- Congratulations.

01:07:25.202 --> 01:07:27.603
- Your first?
- Yes. It's a boy.

01:07:27.604 --> 01:07:30.306
We're so excited.

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:31.574
Matthew will be delivering him.

01:07:31.575 --> 01:07:33.643
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:07:33.644 --> 01:07:35.678
- OB-GYN?
- Yes. You?

01:07:35.679 --> 01:07:37.480
Uh, partner over at Garrison and Shingle.

01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:39.415
- A man of the law.
- Yeah.

01:07:39.416 --> 01:07:41.150
I've worked with you
guys when I was a mediator

01:07:41.151 --> 01:07:42.518
on Thorpe V. Bronwin.

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:45.121
- Sure.
- Elaine, what is it that you do?

01:07:45.122 --> 01:07:46.456
- I teach kindergarten.
- That's right.

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:48.356
I think I knew that.

01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:50.818
Would you excuse me? I'm just
gonna run to the ladies' room.

01:07:57.401 --> 01:07:58.435
<i>Okay, can I cut to the chase?</i>

01:07:58.436 --> 01:07:59.468
<i>I would love that.</i>

01:07:59.469 --> 01:08:00.836
I love cutting to chases. Do it.

01:08:00.838 --> 01:08:02.873
Okay, so you're a womanizer.

01:08:02.874 --> 01:08:04.474
Hey!

01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:05.343
How did you know that?

01:08:05.344 --> 01:08:07.210
- Everybody knows that.
- Everybody?

01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:09.178
Your interns call you a Jump Back Jake.

01:08:09.179 --> 01:08:10.279

Let me guess. I drop it, or
you tell Emma we slept together.

- I'd tell her what I know.
- Which is what?

I know that you stop
breathing when you kiss.

01:33:00.136 --> 01:33:03.171
That when you lean in to
whisper, you put your lips

right up against the back of my earlobe.
