00:02.336 --> 00:05.840
You know what I like?
I like Sichuan.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.382
Man, I love the food here.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.050
You know what else I like?

00:09.051 --> 00:10.678
Torturing my friend Éric Ripert.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.182
I don't know why. Maybe it's

00:15.183 --> 00:17.267
because he's so damn nice.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.060
- You high, man?
- You look high.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.061
I am.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.647
- But I like it.
- Yeah?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.649
You could pretty much
tear his toenails out

00:23.691 --> 00:25.860
and he'd still find something
nice to say about you.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.278
He's so polite, yet
if you look closely,

00:28.320 --> 00:32.658
and I do, his discomfort
can be exquisite.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.684
He's the devil.

00:37.685 --> 00:38.998
Look at him.

It's the spicy,
sensualist heartland

01:28.338 --> 01:31.425
of all the things I
love about China.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.493
The collision between very,
very old and very new,

01:37.494 --> 01:40.517
an exploding middle
class, a lot of history,

01:40.559 --> 01:44.021
and food that could burn
you down to a charred,

01:44.022 --> 01:45.606
smoking little stump.

01:48.984 --> 01:52.362
Sichuan province, located
in the southwest of China,

01:52.404 --> 01:55.156
over a thousand
miles from Beijing.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.158
A region so fertile and lush,

01:57.200 --> 02:00.788
that it's been referred to
as "China's breadbasket."

02:02.873 --> 02:04.583
And it's capital, Chengdu.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.168
Despite its
ever-growing skyline,

02:07.210 --> 02:10.839
it hasn't lost its deep
culinary roots and traditions.

02:10.881 --> 02:15.176
- And I figured, if I'm
going back to Sichuan

02:15.218 --> 02:17.178
I should bring a friend.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.180
Someone unused to the...
How shall I say...

02:19.222 --> 02:22.142
Level of heat commonly
found in the food here.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.229
Someone who's never
been to China before

02:26.271 --> 02:28.231
and is unused to its ways.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.821
I'm talking, of course,
about chef Éric Ripert

02:33.862 --> 02:36.197
three star Michelin restaurants

02:36.239 --> 02:38.408
as New York's Le Bernardin.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.913
-So welcome to China, Éric.

02:42.914 --> 02:44.205
-Thank you.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.374
- First time in the mainland?
- Yeah, yes.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.626
And I'm very surprised already
about, uh, what I see

02:48.627 --> 02:50.253
in the city here.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.215
I was expecting like, uh,
kind of a gigantic Chinatown

02:54.257 --> 02:55.592
that we have in New York.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.803
That's some racist shit right
there, I'm tellin' ya.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.347
No, it's very surprising.

02:59.348 --> 03:00.848
The streets, they're very clean.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.224
Just... it almost looks
like a European city.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.019
Except for the air.

03:05.020 --> 03:07.228
The air quality, I mean,
- maybe you've noticed

03:07.229 --> 03:09.857
that haze...
- Yeah, - it's like the fog.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.857
- That's not... that's not good.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.233
But I'm definitely out
of my comfort zone.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.652
- Really?
- For sure, yeah.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.421
- Well, good.
- Well, I'm hungry, you hungry?

03:15.445 --> 03:16.530
-Yeah.

03:16.531 --> 03:19.700
- Noodles, that's where you
should start around here.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.243
Chengdu is famous for
little spots like this.

03:22.285 --> 03:26.102
Don Don Chen Shui Mian,
named after a much beloved

03:26.103 --> 03:27.916
Chengdu noodle snack.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.460
Oh, yeah, now we're talkin'.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.648
I've never been good
with chopsticks.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.965
- Really?

03:34.966 --> 03:36.257
- Never.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.488
This is not bad.

03:37.489 --> 03:38.677
I can grab it.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.889
Kind of.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.787
Oh, yeah.

03:44.788 --> 03:46.267
That is awesome.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.436
So it's all spicy.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.439
The peppers get on you
I'm... I'm like... whew.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.526
Yeah, well, this is
just day one, man.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.655
I'm surprised you don't
drink beer with that.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.532
Dude, it's only 11:20
in the morning.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.659
What kind of an animal
do you think I am?

04:02.701 --> 04:04.762
- Well, 'cause there's nothing
- to soothe your taste buds.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.207
This is a good sort
of, uh, intro.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.669
- So we're gonna have fun.
- Oh, man.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.295
We're gonna eat well.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.548
You're gonna drink -a
little more than you like.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.548
- Okay.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.885
And I have to stress
this to you now, Éric,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.303
you cannot refuse.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.698
Don't look at me
with eyes like that.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.515
I'm saying it's... drinking

04:25.516 --> 04:27.308
culture is very important here.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.745
And if we go to,
like, a formal meal,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.897
your ability to drink leads
to a number of assumptions

04:31.939 --> 04:33.148
about you, you know?

04:33.190 --> 04:36.193
Your general
manliness, penis size.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.336
Your worth as a human being.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.529
I'm comfortable with my size.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.324
Think of yourself
as an ambassador

04:43.366 --> 04:46.536
not only for America, but
for... for France, Éric.

04:46.578 --> 04:50.331
But I am an ambassador
of Le Bernardin as well.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.333
Of the people who work
with me and so on.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.728
- Right.
- You don't want people, uh,

04:53.752 --> 04:56.004
On the other side of the world

04:56.005 --> 04:58.339
thinking that Le Bernardin
sends pussies out there

04:56.046 --> 04:58.339
to represent.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.717
You know what? You're scaring
the shit out of me now.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.510
Seriously.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.138
Yeah, you can't let
the team down.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.806
To me... to me it's more insulting

05:05.847 --> 05:07.098
-to be shit-faced at the table.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.349
- No, no, not here.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.351
It's perfectly okay to be
shitfaced at the table.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.353
That's completely acceptable.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.355
It's gonna be a wild week.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.775
Yes, I have the sense of that.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.360
♪

05:19.402 --> 05:22.073
Here's something they talk
about a lot in Sichuan

05:22.074 --> 05:23.157
when discussing food.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.951
Two elements of flavor
personified by two ingredients

05:25.993 --> 05:27.765
that are integral to so much

05:27.766 --> 05:29.537
of the cooking around here.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.373
The Sichuan peppercorn,
known for its flowery,

05:32.415 --> 05:35.836
aromatic flavor and its
tingly, mind-deranging,

05:35.877 --> 05:39.380
mouth-numbing effects... a
phenomenon called "ma."

05:39.422 --> 05:42.550
And the spicy chili
peppers like anjing chow,

05:42.592 --> 05:45.386
or the even hotter
facing heaven chili

05:45.428 --> 05:46.596
provide the "la,"

05:46.597 --> 05:47.764
pure heat.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.851
So if you imagine like,
Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS,

05:50.892 --> 05:53.603
tormenting you with nipple
clamps as the "la,"

05:53.645 --> 05:56.773
the "ma" provided by the
pleasantly deranging

05:56.774 --> 05:59.818
peppercorns, would be
like the naughty nurse

05:56.815 --> 05:59.818
with the ice cubes.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.793
What's your, uh, what's
your feeling on MSG?

06:16.835 --> 06:19.004
- I don't mind MSG.
- Yeah, I think it's good stuff.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.318
- I do not react to it.

06:20.319 --> 06:21.589
- Right.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.589
No, no, me too.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
Nobody does. It's a...
It's a lie, man.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.677
But you find a lot of
natural MSG in tomatoes.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.596
-In breast milk and parmesan.

06:27.597 --> 06:29.472
- Yeah, in a... in a
lot of products.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.682
Yeah, you know what causes

06:30.683 --> 06:31.850
Chinese restaurant syndrome?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.311
-Racism.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.230
"Ooh, I have a headache.
It must've been

06:36.271 --> 06:37.480
the Chinese guy."

♪

06:45.072 --> 06:48.388
Most of the traditional,
very famous dishes

06:48.389 --> 06:51.452
of Sichuan cuisine are
not made from chef.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.871

06:54.289 --> 06:57.146
So family dishes

06:57.147 --> 06:58.626
of Sichuan cuisine.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.629
In my quest to set Éric's
perfect hair on fire,

07:01.671 --> 07:04.465
I have arranged dinner
with this man, Go Sa,

07:04.507 --> 07:07.468
who runs the Sichuan
Cuisine Museum here.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.470
He takes us to a
neighborhood favorite,

07:09.512 --> 07:12.849
Tiantian Fang Tian, for
some typical local dishes

07:12.891 --> 07:16.478
like pickled chicken feet,
cartilaginous little bits

07:16.479 --> 07:18.272
of gnawable goodness.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.689
How do you eat this one?

07:19.731 --> 07:23.068
Just, uh, bite it and,
uh, don't eat the bone,

07:21.524 --> 07:23.068
though.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.486
- No, no...
- Oh, it's good.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.863
- It's delicious.
- It's spicy.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.386
-Yeah, very spicy.

07:28.387 --> 07:29.866
-Whew.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.201
- Have some beer.

07:31.202 --> 07:32.493
- Well, the food is really good,

07:32.535 --> 07:34.308
but the spices are little bit

07:34.309 --> 07:36.081
of a challenge, I have to say.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.874
Oh, yeah, now we're talking.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.667
You're gonna love
this dish, my friend.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.295
Yeah, let's, uh,
find the chicken

07:41.336 --> 07:42.296
in the pile of chili.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.923
Pile of chili.

07:44.965 --> 07:49.261
"Laziji" literally means
spicy chicken but the dish,

07:49.262 --> 07:52.513
in practical terms,
is a game of finding

07:52.514 --> 07:55.309
the bits of chicken
in the mountain

07:52.555 --> 07:55.309
of ass-burning goodness.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.185
Come on, it's fun for
the whole family.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.937
"Is that a tiny nubbin
of hacked chicken,

07:58.979 --> 08:01.522
or a nuclear cluster
of chili seeds?"

The Sichuan peppers are
the... for me, like... the really

08:05.028 --> 08:06.111
super-addictive.

- Oh, yeah, I feel them now.
- It's all tingling.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.156
- Yeah.

08:09.157 --> 08:10.157
-Like that, right.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.409
There's a scientific
name for the process,

08:12.451 --> 08:15.787
- for what happens, it's san chul...
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.788 --> 08:18.957
Is the biological agent
that causes confusion

08:18.958 --> 08:20.334
in your nervous system.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.015
- Confusion?
- Tingling. Confusion, yeah.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.130
That's what I feel
right now, yeah.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.591
You're gonna love this dish.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.429
I'm totally confused,
I'll tell you that.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.389
- Oh, mapo doufu.
- Oh, my favorite.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.724
That one, I have the
feeling, is the killer.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.767
Look at that, man.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.145
That is some goodness
right there.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.731
For me, the apex
of Sichuan food.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.985
My absolute favorite,
improbably enough,

08:47.027 --> 08:48.945
is a tofu dish.

08:48.987 --> 08:53.158
This tofu dish, the
legendary mapo doufu,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.369
or pock-marked granny tofu.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.372
Ground pork or beef,
cubes of bean curd

08:58.413 --> 09:01.582
in a rich, deeply-nuanced,

09:01.583 --> 09:05.586
fiery but intensely satisfying
sauce of chili oil,

09:05.587 --> 09:09.007
bean paste, garlic shoots,
ground Sichuan peppercorns,

09:05.628 --> 09:09.007
and MSG.

09:09.049 --> 09:13.094
This dish done right
has got it all.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.701
Oh, that's so good.

09:15.702 --> 09:19.767
It's a perfect balance of
stuff going on in here.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.270
I just love, love,
love this dish.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.981
Actually, the spiciness
makes me already,

09:25.023 --> 09:27.441
like, uh, feeling that I
drunk -kind of, you know?

09:27.442 --> 09:28.776
- Really?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.238
Yeah.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.281
- I'm like... - You high, man?
- You look high.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.158
- I am. But I like it.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.993
-Yeah?

09:37.035 --> 09:40.621
And if you ever, like, have
a hangover, and you will,

09:40.622 --> 09:42.478
my friend, you will,
um, this will scare

09:42.479 --> 09:44.292
the evil right out.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.295
It's prepping me for
a drinking night.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.672
- The glory of France...
- Shut up.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.216
Is on your shoulders.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.223
And tong jiao yu, green
peppercorn fish,

09:58.265 --> 10:02.018
served in a simmering vat
of seasoned fish broth,

10:02.060 --> 10:03.644
laced heavily with
fresh and dried

10:03.686 --> 10:06.169
green Sichuan peppercorns
and finished off

10:06.170 --> 10:09.443
with a heavy pour of
boiling hot vegetable oil.

10:09.484 --> 10:13.447
I think this is the most
numb you are gonna feel.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.823
It's going to be a
challenge, this one, for me.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.659
Any second now,
that perfect hair

10:18.701 --> 10:21.288
is gonna burst into flames.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.039
- That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.541
Yeah.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.127
Man, I love the food here.

10:27.128 --> 10:28.545
How does that feel?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.925
You know, it change... it
change you physically.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.677
Like, I... I feel like
my face is changing.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.013
Changing... Like,
my eyes are in a

10:39.014 --> 10:41.516
- different position. My...
- I got news for you.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.516
- Right?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.331
Yeah, it... you better look

10:43.332 --> 10:45.103
at yourself in a mirror, man.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.563
All right, let's just slow down.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.647
-Don't rush.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.689
- Slow down.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.358
Slow down a little bit.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.360
Man, those peppercorns
are awesome.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.904
I need towels. Holy cow.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.949
-Whoa.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.700
They're all looking at
me from the kitchen.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.496
They're like, "Is this guy
gonna survive or what?"

11:06.333 --> 11:07.667
Thank you.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.506
And do I have to wear
one of those vests?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.132
Ah, jeez.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.344
You're gonna sink like
a stone in this thing.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.307
My friend Éric is a Buddhist.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.518
Not a weekend Buddhist either.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.727
A serious, long-term
practitioner

11:26.769 --> 11:28.146
of Tibetan Buddhism.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.731
It's what makes him
so different from me.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.108
He, for instance, is nice.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.569
I am not always so nice.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.322
On the rock is something
written in Chinese.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.534
Maybe it's, you know,
"Gift shop this way."

11:44.954 --> 11:46.330
-Whoa, check it out, man.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.706
- I know.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.274
About two hours south of
Chengdu at the confluence

11:52.275 --> 11:55.215
of the Min Jiang, Dadu,
and Qingyi Rivers

11:55.256 --> 11:57.133
is the giant Leshan Buddha

11:57.175 --> 12:00.345
carved out of the cliff
wall back in 713.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.763
It still stands as the largest

12:02.805 --> 12:04.765
stone Buddha in the world.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.371
-Whoa, that was pretty awesome.

12:06.372 --> 12:07.935
- That was beautiful, no?

12:07.977 --> 12:11.022
And me without my selfie stick.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.149
Though Éric's Buddhism
diverges somewhat

12:13.191 --> 12:15.569
from the kind practiced
here, as you might imagine,

12:15.610 --> 12:19.614
the site is respected and
revered by all Buddhists.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.827
I am respectful of
faiths not my own

12:24.869 --> 12:26.621
and I am more than happy to let

12:26.622 --> 12:28.373
my friend do what he does.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.957
It means a lot to him.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.086
And like I said, I respect that.
Really.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.594
-Pretty cool.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.761
- Isn't it?

12:51.646 --> 12:53.607
All right.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.816
This is a tasty rabbit
head dispensary.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.816
All right.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.277
- Is it here? No.
- Is it here?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.613
Yeah, man. That's what
you've been waiting for.

12:59.654 --> 13:03.032
But all this time, in a
little evil part of my brain,

13:03.033 --> 13:06.244
I've been secretly looking
forward to this moment.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.289
A tasty Sichuan snack
famous and much-loved

13:09.290 --> 13:10.831
around these parts.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.208
I'm talkin' bunny heads, yo.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.002
Tasty, tasty bunny heads.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.150
-I think you use the glove.

13:16.151 --> 13:17.255
-Yeah.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.048
Like you're doing a
little prostate exam.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.841
- Look at it.
- Look at those teeth.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.010
- He hates it... whoa.
- Oh, you have the tongue too.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.846
Yank the jaw right out.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.202
Oh, that's good.

13:27.203 --> 13:28.516
That is delicious.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.478
Seriously spicy, delicious,
flesh still clinging

13:31.519 --> 13:35.440
to little Thumper's skull,
look at those little teeth.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.734
And the best part, after
you rip off the jaw

13:37.776 --> 13:41.446
and split the skull... the
tasty, chicklet-sized brain.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.864
Mmm, it's a lot of meat.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.866
Suck that brain right out.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.869
I'm not a fan of brains,
but I'm gonna try.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.889
- You haven't had these brains.
- Rabbit brains are different.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.040
They're not like
custardy creamy.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.251
They're kind of like a
little... a little like uni.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.087
♪ Here comes Peter Cottontail ♪

13:58.129 --> 13:59.880
♪ Hoppin' down the bunny trail ♪

13:59.922 --> 14:01.924
Right into my mouth.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.259
How did you crack that?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.885
You just get that soft spot.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.306
You're gonna crack that
thumb in and pry it apart.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.058
Aw, jeez.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.687
Yeah, or you just
pound it on the curb.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.272
So you basically crack it...
Oh, you're winnowing out

14:16.273 --> 14:19.066
the brain with its own jawbone.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.902
There's a certain country
justice to that.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.339
I wish I'd known
about these things.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.282
You know, I'm gonna
make these next Easter.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.788
I mean the whole Easter egg
hunt, what does that have

14:29.952 --> 14:31.788
to do with bunnies?

14:31.830 --> 14:32.931
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.081
Bunnies don't lay eggs.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.543
But they do have heads.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.240
Look deep.

14:46.241 --> 14:50.181
Deep into the murky depths
of that most glorious

14:50.182 --> 14:52.517
and iconic of Sichuan dishes.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.730
It burns. It burns you
down to your soul.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.524
Cheers.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.403
Local friend Xiao Bin and
musician friend, Seven,

15:03.444 --> 15:07.532
Wu Jiao Ling, and Gao Shin
all enjoy a good hotpot.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.950
Almost everybody
around here does.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.413
Eric, however, seems
apprehensive.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.957
So this is Éric's first
time for Sichuan hotpot.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.960
- Really?
- I think you're really going to enjoy this.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.355
So this is particularly
good, right?

15:21.379 --> 15:24.965
Which is known for
being spicy, so...

15:25.007 --> 15:26.926
- Not a good news.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.845
- I see it in my eyes already.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.971
Yeah.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.099
The way it works is, you
order a whole bunch

15:33.100 --> 15:35.142
of ingredients, meat,
vegetables, noodles,

15:35.184 --> 15:36.977
fish, whatever you like.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.022
A lot of different
ingredients, and you feed them

15:38.229 --> 15:40.022
into the pot.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.667
The dog tail, we should
just throw them first.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.377
Yeah, because that's
gonna take a long time.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.985
- Yeah.
- Let's throw that tripe in.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.363
It's called like "thousand
layer stomach."

15:47.405 --> 15:48.989
- It's all going in there, man.
- Yeah.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
The inner ring is a
more neutral broth.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.620
The outer ring, though,
is the good stuff.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.079
The hard stuff.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.126
Oh, that's good man.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.002
That's good.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.589
- That was Eric's first bite...
- Bite.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.006
Of hotpot.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.303
- Awesome, right?

16:10.304 --> 16:12.179
-Yes.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.014
It only gets better, my friend.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.642
- Oh, this is nice.
- Oh, yeah.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.810
Tofu.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.018
- Oh, this is Tofu?
- Yeah.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.124
-Oh, it's the skin on top?

16:19.125 --> 16:20.187
- Yeah.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.649
Common ingredients
like tofu and seaweed,

16:22.690 --> 16:24.651
various meats and
fishes are stirred in

16:24.692 --> 16:27.278
along with ingredients
that are, shall we say,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.030
less familiar to the
Western palate.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.429
- They get the duck...
- Yeah... Then they

16:32.430 --> 16:34.702
reach inside, they grab
the... grab the intestines

16:34.744 --> 16:36.054
and yank 'em out
of the live duck.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.664
- No!
- Yeah.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.707
Supposedly, that's the...
That gives you, like,

16:39.749 --> 16:41.084
-the most fresh.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.418
-But it's a bit cruel, right?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.044
Well, you want 'em fresh, Éric.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.422
- Yeah.
- I think we should drink some beer.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.966
-Yes, I think so.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.467
- Cheers.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.853
-How are you doing there, Eric?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.438
-I'm doing amazingly well.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.065
- Can you hang in there?

17:05.066 --> 17:07.088
- My sinuses are...
- Open.

17:07.089 --> 17:09.069
-So open, you have no idea.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.446
Best part of hotpot is to share.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.073
- Is to share?
- To share.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.075
- Yes, I like that too.
- It's very convivial.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.663
- Yeah.
- Sometimes we have, like, hotpots for four hours.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.580
Four hours... As it cooks down,

17:21.582 --> 17:24.711
it gets stronger and stronger

17:24.752 --> 17:26.086
and the heat more intense.

17:26.127 --> 17:29.089
A delicious, yet
unpredictable silt of spice

this river of hot lava.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.888

Man, it's spicy.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.103
You feel enlightened yet?

19:21.243 --> 19:23.788
Always a seeker,
checking out the sites,

19:23.830 --> 19:26.061
sucking up knowledge,
nibbling at the edges

19:26.062 --> 19:28.063
of celebrity due, no
doubt, to the fact
