00:54.597 --> 00:58.643
<i>I always knew we were a fairly
odd family. First there was me.</i>

00:59.018 --> 01:02.021
<i>Too tall. Too skinny.
Too orange.</i>

01:02.564 --> 01:05.024
<i>My mum was lovely,
but not like other mums.</i>

01:05.149 --> 01:06.608
<i>There was
something solid about her.</i>

01:06.609 --> 01:09.696
<i>Something rectangular,
busy and unsentimental.</i>

01:09.821 --> 01:11.573
<i>Her fashion icon was the Queen.</i>

01:12.490 --> 01:16.911
<i>Dad, well, he was more normal. He always
seemed to have time on his hands.</i>

01:17.036 --> 01:20.331
<i>After giving up teaching university
students on his 50th birthday,</i>

01:20.456 --> 01:23.710
<i>he was eternally available
for a leisurely chat or</i>

01:23.835 --> 01:25.127
<i>to let me win at table tennis.</i>

01:25.128 --> 01:26.378
Ahh!
Oh, yes.

01:26.379 --> 01:29.257
<i>And then there was Mum's
brother, Uncle Desmond.</i>

01:29.382 --> 01:33.386
<i>Always impeccably dressed. He
spent the days just, well,</i>

01:33.511 --> 01:35.096
<i>being Uncle Desmond.</i>

01:35.221 --> 01:38.099
<i>He was the most charming and least
clever man you could ever meet.</i>

01:38.850 --> 01:42.020
<i>His mind was on other things,
though we never found out what.</i>

01:42.228 --> 01:45.105
<i>And then,
finally there was Catherine.</i>

01:45.106 --> 01:47.859
<i>Katie. Kit Kat. My sister.</i>

01:48.026 --> 01:51.529
<i>In a household of sensible jackets
and haircuts there was this,</i>

01:51.696 --> 01:54.198
<i>well, what can I call her,
nature thing.</i>

01:54.365 --> 01:59.120
<i>With her elfin eyes, her purple
T-shirts and her eternally bare feet,</i>

01:59.245 --> 02:01.706
<i>she was then,
and still is to me,</i>

02:01.873 --> 02:04.583
<i>about the most wonderful
thing in the world.</i>

02:05.697 --> 02:07.377
<i>All in all, it was
a pretty good childhood.</i>

02:07.378 --> 02:09.422
<i>Full of repeated
rhythms and patterns.</i>

02:09.589 --> 02:11.298
<i>By the time I was 21,
we were still</i>

02:11.299 --> 02:13.635
<i>having tea on the beach
every single day.</i>

02:13.760 --> 02:16.554
<i>Skimming stones and
eating sandwiches,</i>

02:16.721 --> 02:20.015
<i>summer and winter,
no matter what the weather.</i>

02:20.016 --> 02:21.392
Oh!

02:24.228 --> 02:26.898
<i>And every Friday evening,
a film,</i>

02:27.774 --> 02:29.776
<i>no matter what the weather.</i>

02:30.735 --> 02:34.947
<i>And then once a year, the
dreaded New Year's Eve party.</i>

02:51.756 --> 02:53.758
Yeah, I might just get one.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.681
You're absolutely gorgeous.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.267
I'm Katie.
What am I drinking?

03:04.102 --> 03:05.937
This is very expensive stuff.

03:06.104 --> 03:07.397
Cheers.
Cheers.

03:22.328 --> 03:23.829
Come on, it's nearly midnight.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.832
We're all going through.
We're going through.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.877
Look, I've gotta find you a...

03:29.460 --> 03:30.795
Oh, God!

03:31.087 --> 03:34.757
Everyone makes little mistakes.
It's fine. Come on.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.010
...6, 5,

03:38.136 --> 03:41.139
4, 3, 2, 1.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.307
Happy New Year!

03:43.474 --> 03:45.518
Happy New Year.

03:47.437 --> 03:48.438
Sorry.

04:00.450 --> 04:02.367
<i>And so I woke up
the next morning,</i>

04:02.368 --> 04:05.203
<i>hung-over,
ashamed of myself,</i>

04:05.204 --> 04:06.997
<i>and not realising
it was the day</i>

04:06.998 --> 04:08.623
<i>that would change
my life forever.</i>

04:10.209 --> 04:11.878
Get up, stupid.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.007
Dad wants you.

04:16.132 --> 04:18.718
Oh, hello.
Sexy pyjamas.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.892
Ah, Tim, come in.

04:26.017 --> 04:27.310
Uh, do

04:28.311 --> 04:29.645
sit down.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.691
That's very formal.

04:34.192 --> 04:36.152
Well, um, yeah.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.029
This is an odd moment for me

04:38.196 --> 04:40.322
because I had
the same moment with my

04:40.323 --> 04:42.825
father when I'd just
turned 21, and after it,

04:43.701 --> 04:48.705
my life was never the same, so I
approach it pretty, um, nervously.

04:48.706 --> 04:49.707
Okay.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.334
When you're ready.
It's all very mysterious.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.045
Uh... Right.

04:56.130 --> 04:59.467
Tim, my dear son, the, uh...

05:01.177 --> 05:03.638
The simple fact is
the men in this family

05:03.763 --> 05:06.224
have always had
the ability to...

05:07.225 --> 05:09.185
This is going to sound strange,

05:09.727 --> 05:13.396
be prepared for strangeness.
Get ready for spooky time,

05:13.397 --> 05:16.359
but there's this family secret.

05:16.692 --> 05:21.030
And the secret is that
the men in the family can

05:23.741 --> 05:25.660
travel in time.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.872
Well, more accurately,
travel back in time.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.082
We can't travel
into the future.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.876
This is such a weird joke.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.254
It's seriously not a joke.

05:38.005 --> 05:42.760
So you're saying that you and
granddad, and his brothers

05:42.927 --> 05:45.221
could all travel back in time?
Absolutely.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.265
And you still do?
Absolutely.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.600
Although it's not as dramatic as it sounds.
It's only in my own life.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.604
I can only go to places where I
actually was and can remember.

05:53.729 --> 05:57.441
I can't kill Hitler or shag
Helen of Troy, unfortunately.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.776
Okay, stop.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.486
Um...

06:01.445 --> 06:03.948
If it's true, which it isn't.
Although it is.

06:04.065 --> 06:06.449
Although it isn't, obviously.
But if it was, which it's not.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.450
Which it is.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.453
Which it isn't.
But if it was, how would I...

06:09.579 --> 06:11.788
The "How" is
the easy bit, in fact.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.125
You go into a dark place,
big cupboards are

06:14.250 --> 06:16.586
very useful generally.
Toilets, at a pinch.

06:16.711 --> 06:19.129
Then you clench
your fists like this.

06:19.130 --> 06:20.631
Think of the moment
you're going to

06:20.798 --> 06:22.258
and you'll find yourself there.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.636
After a bit of a stumble
and a rumble and a tumble.

06:26.137 --> 06:27.138
Wow.

06:27.305 --> 06:29.307
Is as good a reaction as any.

06:29.432 --> 06:33.603
I think I plumped for "fuck!"
but it was the '70s.

06:33.728 --> 06:35.271
No, this is
so obviously a joke.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.898
It's not a joke.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.775
Why would I lie to someone I'm

06:40.443 --> 06:41.527
fairly fond of?

06:41.652 --> 06:42.737
Okay.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.654
But, when I come
back downstairs

06:44.655 --> 06:47.325
after standing in a cupboard
with my fists clenched,

06:47.491 --> 06:49.660
you're gonna be
in so much trouble.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.494
Well, let's see, shall we?

06:51.495 --> 06:52.663
Mmm.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.667
Oh, and, Tim, try and
do something interesting.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.502
So much trouble.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.588
I mean it. Really.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.932
Right.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.258
Wow!

08:02.400 --> 08:03.608
You all right, Tim?

08:03.609 --> 08:05.944
Yes. Yeah.
Good, ace. Yeah.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.863
Good, come on. It's nearly
midnight and we've got to find...

08:08.864 --> 08:10.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:14.412 --> 08:15.620
Whoo! Midnight.

08:15.621 --> 08:18.749
10, 9, 8, 7,

08:19.250 --> 08:21.459
6, 5, 4,

08:21.460 --> 08:24.630
3,2,1.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.966
Happy New Year!

08:34.807 --> 08:36.225
Thank you, Tim.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.768
You're welcome, Polly.

09:01.459 --> 09:02.584
Does Mum know?

09:02.585 --> 09:03.669
Not a whistle.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.003
Strange.
And what about the whole...

09:05.004 --> 09:06.546
Butterfly effect thing.
What can I say?

09:06.547 --> 09:08.799
We don't seem to have
messed up civilisation yet.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.301
It's gonna be
a complicated year.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.011
It's gonna be
a complicated life.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.513
What have you done with it?

09:15.514 --> 09:17.641
For me,
it's books, books, books.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.018
I've read everything
a man could wish to.

09:20.019 --> 09:24.690
Twice. Dickens three times.
Any first thoughts?

09:25.272 --> 09:27.776
Well, I suppose apart from getting
a slightly better haircut...

09:27.777 --> 09:28.860
Yeah.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.261
...money would be
the obvious thing.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.780
Very mixed blessing.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.461
Utterly screwed up
your grandfather's life.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.201
Left him without
love or friends.

09:35.326 --> 09:37.745
I've never bumped into a
genuinely happy rich person.

09:37.912 --> 09:39.996
It would be nice
not to have to work.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.831
No, that's a real
recipe for disaster.

09:41.832 --> 09:42.854
Look what happened
to Uncle Fred.

09:42.855 --> 09:44.000
What happened to Uncle Fred?

09:44.001 --> 09:46.461
Absolutely sod all.

09:46.462 --> 09:47.754
Wasted his life.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.839
You have to use it for
things that you really think

09:49.840 --> 09:51.675
will make your life
the way you want it to be.

09:51.842 --> 09:54.427
Come on,
really think about this.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.429
Well,

09:56.722 --> 09:59.183
to be honest,
I suppose, at the moment,

09:59.850 --> 10:03.311
it would be just great if it
could help me get a girlfriend.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.730
Wow.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.192
Massive.
Yeah.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.945
The mothership.

10:12.905 --> 10:16.033
<i>For me, it was always
gonna be about love.</i>

10:16.200 --> 10:18.953
<i>And that summer I walked
into the eye of the storm.</i>

10:20.788 --> 10:23.290
<i>Her name was Charlotte.
Cousin of Kit Kat's</i>

10:23.415 --> 10:25.876
<i>handsome but
nasty boyfriend Jimmy.</i>

10:27.920 --> 10:30.714
<i>And she was staying
for two whole months.</i>

10:34.552 --> 10:36.554
Just one.
Not both of them.

10:38.806 --> 10:39.807
Tim,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.560
will you do my back?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.102
Absolutely!

10:48.065 --> 10:49.900
Very keen!

10:51.902 --> 10:54.947
Whoa! Oh, no. Oh, no.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.908
Oh, no. No, no.
No, no, no.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.578
Is it in my hair?
Yes!

11:08.460 --> 11:12.047
Tim. Will you
do my back?

11:12.256 --> 11:14.633
Sure. Just give us a sec.

11:16.969 --> 11:17.970
Okay.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.942
Thank you.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.404
Now...

11:42.953 --> 11:44.288
Ooh. Nice.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.290
It's my area.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.171
<i>It was a summer of
suntan and torture.</i>

11:53.187 --> 11:55.131
<i>I invited my foolish friend
Jay around for tennis</i>

11:55.132 --> 11:57.384
<i>because I thought
he'd make me look good.</i>

12:01.430 --> 12:02.973
Ah! Ow!

12:03.140 --> 12:04.266
<i>I was wrong!</i>

12:04.934 --> 12:06.602
Ow! What are you doing?
Oh, no.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.315
<i>Charlotte just made both
of us look like idiots.</i>

12:12.316 --> 12:13.817
Bad luck, Tim.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.991
<i>How the hell are you meant
to concentrate on your game?</i>

12:21.659 --> 12:23.744
<i>How are you meant
to live your life</i>

12:23.869 --> 12:25.996
<i>with this sort of
shit going down?</i>

12:27.581 --> 12:30.334
<i>It never got better
until suddenly</i>

12:30.834 --> 12:32.920
<i>it was almost too late.</i>

12:33.462 --> 12:35.798
Well, Charlotte,
our final lunch.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.174
No!

12:37.466 --> 12:40.803
And it's been really, really
lovely having you all summer.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.971
It has.

12:42.096 --> 12:43.138
Thank you.
Thank you.

12:43.264 --> 12:44.515
It really has.

12:44.682 --> 12:45.933
Hasn't it, Desmond?

12:46.183 --> 12:47.308
Beg your pardon?

12:47.309 --> 12:49.478
Lovely having
Charlotte here all summer.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.313
Charlotte?
Who's Charlotte?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.691
Come on, darling. Charlotte,
sitting next to you.

12:54.984 --> 12:58.320
Oh, yes, of course. Of course.
Charlotte. Hi.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.531
Lovely to meet you.

13:04.994 --> 13:08.330
Have you enjoyed having
Charlotte here all summer, Tim?

13:09.957 --> 13:10.958
Yeah.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.377
There goes August.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.545
I've introduced him to
most things, haven't I?

13:15.546 --> 13:18.048
You did. You were
much more sophisticated.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.884
In a quiet way,
I like to think.

13:34.732 --> 13:36.066
Come in.

13:38.402 --> 13:39.653
Charlotte.
Yeah!

13:43.574 --> 13:47.202
As it's your last night,
can I ask you a question?

13:48.078 --> 13:49.830
Oh, yeah. Ask away.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.498
No, wait.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.919
It's not going to
be about love, is it?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.588
Love? What?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.423
Well, it's just that Kit Kat
warned me that if you

13:59.548 --> 14:01.258
were to ever mention it,
I should be

14:01.383 --> 14:03.552
very firm with you and tell you

14:03.677 --> 14:05.928
you must treat me
like your sister

14:05.929 --> 14:07.389
and not be stupid.

14:08.265 --> 14:11.268
Or have I just made
a total fool of myself

14:11.393 --> 14:12.994
and you were actually
going to ask me for

14:13.103 --> 14:14.688
late night last
minute tennis tips?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.440
No, it was the love thing.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.109
Oh. Well.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.571
That's very sweet of you.

14:23.405 --> 14:26.783
It's just a shame you
left it till the last night.

14:26.784 --> 14:31.622
You should have tried creeping along
the corridor while we still had time.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.792
Okay, the "last night"
was a bad idea?

14:34.958 --> 14:39.797
Very bad idea. It feels like an ever
so slightly insulting afterthought.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.466
"Last night" was
never going to work.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.136
All right. Good.
I've got it.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.908
Come in.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.245
Tim. Hi.
Charlotte.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.414
Hi.
Sit down.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.670
I know you've
probably suspected this,

15:19.837 --> 15:23.424
but over the last month I've fallen
completely in love with you.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.845
Now obviously
this was gonna happen

15:28.095 --> 15:32.181
because you're
a goddess with that face

15:32.182 --> 15:33.976
and that hair,

15:34.268 --> 15:37.271
but even if you
didn't have a nice face,

15:38.272 --> 15:40.941
and even if you had
absolutely no hair

15:41.191 --> 15:43.777
because of some
bizarre medical reason,

15:45.195 --> 15:47.156
I'd still adore you,

15:47.698 --> 15:48.699
and I...

15:49.199 --> 15:53.871
I just wondered whether, by any
chance, you might share my feelings.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.206
Wow.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.418
I tell you what.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.128
Why don't we see
how the summer goes

16:02.129 --> 16:05.966
and then you ask me
again on my last night?

16:07.843 --> 16:09.636
Your last night?
Yes.

16:10.012 --> 16:14.016
Try me on the last night. See
what happens then, shall we?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.226
It's exciting.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.644
Right.

16:18.228 --> 16:22.441
No, it's a perfect plan. That's
absolutely perfect. Last night.

16:22.566 --> 16:23.984
Last night.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.447
Thanks very much.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.116
Night-night, Timmy.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.417
<i>Big lesson number one,</i>

16:40.542 --> 16:43.712
<i>all the time travel in the world
can't make someone love you.</i>

16:43.837 --> 16:44.838
Bye!

16:46.048 --> 16:48.258
<i>So the love of my life
just drove away.</i>

16:49.760 --> 16:53.514
<i>And the very next day
it was my turn to leave.</i>

16:56.266 --> 16:59.269
There you go. Don't
spend it all at once.

17:00.979 --> 17:01.980
Thanks.

17:03.482 --> 17:07.402
Don't call too often, your mother
doesn't like to be disturbed.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.695
Okay. Thanks.

17:28.089 --> 17:32.469
<i>I caught the train to London in
search of a future and a girlfriend.</i>

17:35.138 --> 17:37.473
<i>I was staying in St John's
Wood, near Abbey Road,</i>

17:37.474 --> 17:40.644
<i>with a playwright friend
of my dad's called Harry.</i>

17:40.936 --> 17:44.690
<i>It's always nice to have family connections
when you're a new kid in town.</i>

17:57.619 --> 18:01.373
What the fuck do you want?

18:03.584 --> 18:04.710
I'm James's son.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.003
Who?

18:07.212 --> 18:09.339
James Lake.
What about him?

18:12.009 --> 18:13.760
He said you had a room.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.598
Go in there and wait.

18:18.599 --> 18:21.935
Quietly. I mean it,
don't make a sound.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.438
Or I'll kill you.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.658
I was actually having the first
good idea I've had for a decade

18:37.659 --> 18:39.202
when you rang on the doorbell.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.622
But now it's gone.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.374
You little shit.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.084
How's your dad?

18:46.376 --> 18:50.464
Weird cock, I always thought.
Something weird about him.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.464
Really?

18:51.465 --> 18:53.967
Yeah, I never really
liked him, actually.

18:55.010 --> 18:57.512
Your mum still
look like Andy Warhol?

18:57.638 --> 18:58.639
What?

19:00.015 --> 19:02.601
That, by the way, is my wife.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.227
Oh. Nice.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.793
Yeah, you wouldn't
like her at first.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.982
Sarcastic cow.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.277
But eventually
you'd realise that

19:12.778 --> 19:15.447
she's the best human
being in the world.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.450
Which is why she
left me, of course.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.579
Here you go.

19:23.205 --> 19:26.958
Try not to make too much noise,
particularly when having sex.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.709
No chance of that.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.421
Oh, Christ,
two losers in one house.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.589
That is my daughter.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.758
Oh.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.804
Have sex with her if you like.
Apparently everyone else has.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.558
<i>It wasn't a hopeful
set-up for romance.</i>

19:44.309 --> 19:46.978
<i>And work didn't help
on that score either.</i>

19:47.396 --> 19:50.107
<i>The world of law seems to
be entirely full of men.</i>

19:52.317 --> 19:56.655
Hello. I'm Rory. Very pleased to meet you.
A real thrill.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.742
Well, who knows, we might become,
you know, pals, et cetera.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.829
Who the hell are you?
Tim Lake.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.081
Well, I hope you're
better than this clown.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.250
Come on, Roger.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.876
It's Rory, actually.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.627
I've been here
a year and a half.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.214
I'm just saying that to be nice.
It's two years actually.

20:16.299 --> 20:20.887
<i>So six lonely months went by
and it was still just me and Harry.</i>

20:21.012 --> 20:23.515
<i>Me lawyer-ing every hour
of the day and night.</i>

20:23.640 --> 20:26.893
<i>And him putting the finishing
touches to his new play.</i>

20:28.895 --> 20:31.523
<i>No matter how many girls
there were in the world,</i>

20:31.648 --> 20:34.776
<i>I always seemed to
end up with Rory.</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:35.902
Hello.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.071
<i>Until, out of the blue,</i>

20:38.530 --> 20:43.452
<i>on a dodgy night out with dodgy
Jay, something miraculous happened.</i>

20:44.119 --> 20:45.954
...the waiters are,

20:46.329 --> 20:48.122
wait for this,
right, they're blind.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.249
Oh! You're kidding me?

20:49.374 --> 20:52.878
I'm kidding you not.
No, as bats. As bats!

20:53.101 --> 20:55.045
Very good to
have you here, gentlemen.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.047
I hope you enjoy
your experience.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.176
Carlo will show
you to your table.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.553
Great. Lead on,
maestro.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.346
Can I have your right hand on
my right shoulder, please?

21:04.347 --> 21:06.767
And your friend hold on to your shoulder.
Thank you.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.899
Mind the stairs and
be prepared because

21:14.149 --> 21:16.401
it's completely dark.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.154
Okay, gentlemen,
if you don't mind,

21:20.155 --> 21:22.615
I can sit you here beside
these two young ladies.

21:22.616 --> 21:24.701
No, no.
Sounds absolutely perfect!

21:24.826 --> 21:27.077
Oh, God, you sound very perky.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.537
I am.
And very handsome.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.208
Oh! Someone's there.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.502
Hi.
Hi. I'm Mary.

21:33.627 --> 21:36.296
I'm Tim. Mary's my
mother's name, actually.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.007
Does it suit her?
Sort of.

21:39.132 --> 21:42.676
Although she's sturdy, so Bernard
might have been a better fit.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.013
Okay.

21:45.388 --> 21:48.099
Oh! Something just
touched my elbow.

21:48.225 --> 21:49.642
Okay, that wasn't me.

21:49.643 --> 21:53.063
No. Well, that just makes it worse.
If it wasn't you, who was it?

21:53.188 --> 21:56.399
It wasn't me because I'm
touching something else.

21:56.525 --> 21:59.152
Yes, and you'll stop
that right away, thank you.

21:59.528 --> 22:04.198
So, girls, be honest,
who is more beautiful?

22:04.199 --> 22:05.742
- Oh, I am.
- Yeah. She is.

22:05.867 --> 22:06.993
Excellent!

22:07.118 --> 22:08.662
Actually,
I look like Kate Moss.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.330
Really?

22:10.455 --> 22:13.374
No. I sort of
look like a squirrel.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.002
Do you like Kate Moss?

22:16.127 --> 22:17.504
I absolutely love her.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.799
In fact, I almost wore one of
her dresses here tonight. You?

22:20.924 --> 22:23.217
No, no, her clothes
look terrible on me.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.097
I cannot believe that it's
your birthday next week as well.

22:28.098 --> 22:32.143
Your friend Jay is
quite enthusiastic.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.563
I actually hate him.

22:34.688 --> 22:35.605
What's Joanna like?

22:35.730 --> 22:38.483
She's basically a prostitute.
Yeah.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.235
I think it's strawberry mousse.
Ooh!

22:41.236 --> 22:42.444
Do you want some?

22:42.445 --> 22:43.863
Um... Okay.
I'll try it.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.155
Okay, where's your mouth?

22:45.156 --> 22:46.783
Uh, it's...

22:47.659 --> 22:49.035
It's here.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.495
Okay. Mmm... There?
Oh!

22:50.662 --> 22:52.455
Oh, my God, what was that?

22:52.581 --> 22:54.374
That's my eye.

22:54.499 --> 22:57.459
I think there's a lot of...
I've got quite a lot of

22:57.460 --> 22:59.504
strawberry mousse
in my eye now!

22:59.629 --> 23:01.005
I'm so sorry.

23:01.006 --> 23:04.341
No. Thank you. That's
a new sensation for me.

23:06.803 --> 23:10.390
So, maybe I'll see
you outside or...

23:10.724 --> 23:12.392
Yeah. Yeah, great.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.311
Great. Scary.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.688
Yeah, it's a bit scary.

23:16.980 --> 23:20.150
Oh, my God, I'm so in there.
What about you?

23:20.275 --> 23:23.068
I don't know,
but she sounded wonderful.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.279
Oh, shh!

23:25.488 --> 23:27.198
Joanna?
Jay.

23:27.324 --> 23:29.409
Christ, you're a babe.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.161
How do you fancy
stretching the night

23:31.286 --> 23:32.871
out a bit?
I can ditch the loser.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.414
We've got to rush,
but help me find a cab

23:34.539 --> 23:35.998
and I might give you my number.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.082
Of course. Yeah.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.834
Or I might not.
Haven't decided yet. So...

23:38.835 --> 23:40.337
I have. It's not
gonna happen.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.616
Hi.
Hi.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.035
Where's...

24:12.202 --> 24:13.286
Oh. She and Jay just...

24:13.411 --> 24:16.039
She took him to...
I don't know.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.165
Right.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.501
Oh, well, I guess I'd better...

24:19.626 --> 24:23.296
Would it be very wrong if I
asked you for your number?

24:25.298 --> 24:26.299
No.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.678
Just in case I ever
had to call you about...

24:30.303 --> 24:31.846
Stuff?
Mmm-hmm.

24:32.597 --> 24:33.598
Okay.

24:37.811 --> 24:39.145
Would you...

24:39.854 --> 24:41.064
It's Mary.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.440
Mary.

24:44.609 --> 24:45.860
Okay.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.655
I thought this phone
was old and shit,

24:49.364 --> 24:51.574
but suddenly it's my most
valuable possession.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.411
You really like me?

24:56.079 --> 24:58.665
Even my frock?

24:58.790 --> 25:00.917
I love your frock.

25:01.543 --> 25:05.130
And my hair?
It's not too brown?

25:05.463 --> 25:07.007
I love brown.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.092
My fringe is new.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.386
The fringe is perfect.
Fringe is the best bit.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.513
Mary!

25:13.638 --> 25:16.975
We have to go! I found a cab and his
dodgy friend is about to assault me.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.436
Okay, I'm coming.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.146
Two seconds.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.940
I hope I see you again.

25:24.566 --> 25:25.692
You Will.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.570
Okay. Good.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.156
Goodnight.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.533
Goodnight.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.530
What's happened?

26:12.781 --> 26:14.866
What have you done,
you poor thing?

26:15.158 --> 26:18.078
Nothing.
It's just a flesh wound.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.496
Here.
Thank you.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.293
You may remember,
my play opened tonight.

26:25.877 --> 26:27.462
Oh, my God, yes.
How did it go?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.130
Well. It went well.

26:29.506 --> 26:33.051
You could tell in the room a
masterpiece was being unfurled.

26:33.176 --> 26:35.178
Really?
Really.

26:35.303 --> 26:38.848
Until, and this is the
crucial plot point, I think,

26:38.973 --> 26:43.728
until the lead actor had the most
massive dry in the history of theatre.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.396
No, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.441
He didn't just
forget his lines.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.192
He forgot his lines
to the extent

26:50.193 --> 26:52.612
that no actor has ever
forgotten their lines

26:52.737 --> 26:55.115
before in
the annals of dramatic art.

26:55.657 --> 26:59.118
The reviews won't say, "Major
masterpiece gets unveiled,"

26:59.119 --> 27:02.789
they'll say, "Major
actor gets Alzheimer's."

27:03.456 --> 27:04.958
It's a disaster.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.585
Is an understatement.

27:08.419 --> 27:13.049
It's the Titanic of play
openings, but with no survivors.

27:13.716 --> 27:16.052
No women, no children,

27:16.469 --> 27:18.721
not even Kate Winslet.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.849
All dead.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.226
Okay. I'll see
what I can do.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.603
What does that mean?

27:26.396 --> 27:28.356
What are you gonna do?
Ring up every critic

27:28.481 --> 27:30.400
in London and
offer them a blowjob

27:30.525 --> 27:35.238
if they ignore the fact that we sat
in total silence for half an hour

27:35.363 --> 27:40.451
waiting for a moron to
remember one single line?

27:40.577 --> 27:42.328
Not quite that.

27:58.970 --> 27:59.971
Hello.

28:03.600 --> 28:08.771
Hello, Sir Tom. I'm a friend of Harry's.
How's it going with the lines?

28:10.106 --> 28:12.358
I'm sorry,
what do you mean "the lines"?

28:13.109 --> 28:14.860
It's just, you know,
in the court scenes,

28:14.861 --> 28:17.572
some of those lines
are pretty complex.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.074
And I just thought maybe it
might be worth, you know,

28:20.700 --> 28:22.242
having one last
look at the lines

28:22.243 --> 28:25.622
before you go on.
A little refresher.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.125
Fuck off out of here.

28:29.250 --> 28:34.005
You arsing lunatic. Get out!
You ginger twerp. Go on!

28:34.130 --> 28:35.882
Patronising piece of...

28:47.977 --> 28:50.396
And now the Defence.

29:00.782 --> 29:05.453
I have lived
many weary years...

29:05.745 --> 29:07.789
It's brilliant.
...but never,

29:07.914 --> 29:11.960
in that long catalogue
of wasted time,

29:12.627 --> 29:17.090
have I ever seen such an atrocious
miscarriage of justice.

29:22.303 --> 29:26.641
Do the Prosecution have
anything final to add?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.313
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

30:20.653 --> 30:25.241
Do the Prosecution have
anything final to add?

30:32.332 --> 30:33.416
Psst!

30:40.840 --> 30:41.883
Gentlemen...

30:44.260 --> 30:45.261
Gentlemen,

30:45.803 --> 30:50.308
I regard today's proceedings
with the utmost gravity.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.185
Nevertheless,

30:52.769 --> 30:55.646
let us be clear of one

30:57.523 --> 31:00.360
simple and salient thing.

31:03.363 --> 31:05.114
It is the life

31:05.698 --> 31:07.658
of a guilty man!

31:18.961 --> 31:22.631
One of the actors appeared
to have actually fallen asleep...

31:22.632 --> 31:26.176
Oh, here's the little prick who
walked out halfway through.

31:26.177 --> 31:28.096
You missed the best scene,
you little twerp.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.222
Sorry.

31:29.639 --> 31:31.808
What did you think of the set?

31:32.141 --> 31:33.433
I thought it was incredible.

31:33.434 --> 31:36.562
Did you? I didn't.
Too brown.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.067
Mary!

31:43.111 --> 31:44.779
Oh, no.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.156
She's gone.

32:02.338 --> 32:06.342
Two girls in earlier tonight. One of
them the prettiest girl in the world.

32:06.467 --> 32:10.346
The other one like a sort of nice
prostitute. Did you get their names?

32:10.471 --> 32:14.267
Oh, yes. They left
a while ago. Let's see.

32:15.309 --> 32:17.770
No, I'm afraid
they were walk-ins

32:17.895 --> 32:20.356
and it appears
they paid by cash.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.483
Sorry, sir.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.368
Oh, that's okay.
That's fine, it's brilliant.

32:24.694 --> 32:27.822
It's just the end of my life.
Thanks so much.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.053
Cheer up, mate.

32:51.387 --> 32:55.224
Apparently, you're living with
Britain's greatest living playwright.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.059
I don't usually
read them, obviously,

32:57.226 --> 32:58.728
but I couldn't resist this one.

32:58.895 --> 33:03.900
"Harry Chapman
found guilty of genius."

33:10.823 --> 33:12.116
I have to go out.
Right now.

33:12.241 --> 33:13.576
Why?

33:13.701 --> 33:15.495
She loves Kate Moss.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.957
Thanks for keeping
me company, Kittle.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.750
Nothing better to do.

34:02.875 --> 34:03.960
How's Jimmy?

34:04.126 --> 34:05.127
Dumped me.

34:05.253 --> 34:06.254
Ugh. Not again.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.089
And work?
They've sacked me.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.215
Idiots.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.467
Coffee?
Please.

34:12.134 --> 34:15.429
I've only just noticed this cat
in this picture. See that cat?

34:15.554 --> 34:18.431
I do see that cat.
It's very good.

34:19.475 --> 34:20.976
Oh, my God.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.062
Oh, my God!

34:23.187 --> 34:24.313
What?

34:24.938 --> 34:26.315
It's her.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.652
It's her!

34:30.735 --> 34:32.237
That's her!

34:33.322 --> 34:34.739
Shh!

34:37.994 --> 34:39.579
You go, girl.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.341
Sorry.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.303
Hi.
Hi.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.848
How are you?

34:59.599 --> 35:01.684
I'm... I'm fine.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.186
It's so good to see you.

35:04.353 --> 35:06.522
Um...
We've never met before.

35:07.857 --> 35:09.817
Oh, no, fuck.

35:10.443 --> 35:12.486
No, of course we haven't.
No.

35:12.612 --> 35:15.656
Sorry, I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.450
No, no, no.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.785
Your name's Mary.

35:21.037 --> 35:23.831
That's distinctly weird.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.833
How do you know that?

35:26.834 --> 35:28.711
Well, you look like a Mary.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.504
In what way?

35:30.630 --> 35:31.881
My mum's called Mary.

35:32.048 --> 35:33.507
I look like your mother?

35:34.050 --> 35:36.177
No. You're much prettier.

35:39.388 --> 35:40.806
It's a nice fringe, by the way.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.350
God, it's new and

35:42.475 --> 35:44.393
probably too short but...
No.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.396
Well, gee, thank you and

35:47.563 --> 35:49.899
listen, it was
really nice to meet you.

35:50.066 --> 35:53.735
I should probably go because
my friend's waiting for me

35:53.736 --> 35:56.155
and you're a,
you're a total stranger.

35:56.405 --> 35:57.823
Total stranger.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.407
Yeah, it's crazy stuff.

35:59.408 --> 36:01.243
Yeah, kind of.
Okay.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.745
Bye, Mary.
Bye.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.082
Oh, no.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.250
How did it go?

36:08.376 --> 36:09.584
It was very poor.

36:09.585 --> 36:10.920
Very poor indeed, yeah.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.421
You gotta go again.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.257
You can do it.
Take two.

36:18.678 --> 36:22.014
She just always... She
always looks different.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.102
Sorry. It's me again.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.229
Hi.
Sorry.

36:28.938 --> 36:30.731
Joanna, this is...

36:31.190 --> 36:32.400
Tim.

36:32.525 --> 36:33.693
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

36:36.278 --> 36:39.949
Tim is a total stranger whose
mother's name is Mary.

36:40.074 --> 36:42.867
I just had a weird
experience with Mary here

36:42.868 --> 36:45.413
of thinking she was someone else.
But she wasn't.

36:45.538 --> 36:49.750
But I just wondered if I
could walk round with you

36:50.710 --> 36:54.630
for a while because my sister
Kit Kat is about to leave...

36:54.755 --> 36:55.756
Yeah.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.052
Bye.
...and...

37:00.386 --> 37:01.804
And so,

37:02.722 --> 37:04.974
I'm about to be quite lonely.

37:05.641 --> 37:09.937
Right. Well, I think we
should probably say no.

37:10.062 --> 37:13.149
No, yes. But on the other hand,
he's got a quite nice smile

37:13.274 --> 37:15.317
and sort of,
you know, fun hair.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.070
Yeah.

37:19.113 --> 37:20.489
All right.

37:20.990 --> 37:24.994
But you have to promise that you are
not one of the following things.

37:25.161 --> 37:26.870
One, a lunatic.

37:26.871 --> 37:27.997
Yeah.
No.

37:28.164 --> 37:30.958
Two, a fringe fetishist.

37:31.292 --> 37:34.295
I'm just Kate Moss's
number one male fan.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.631
Oh, God.
Really?

37:37.757 --> 37:39.174
Yeah. God, yeah.

37:39.175 --> 37:42.511
Do you agree that the magic
of her lies in her history?

37:43.095 --> 37:45.388
That the informality
of her early shots

37:45.389 --> 37:48.516
compared to this stuff
so you just always know

37:48.517 --> 37:50.977
that, despite the high
fashion, she's still just

37:50.978 --> 37:54.607
that cheeky normal
naked girl on the beach?

37:55.691 --> 37:57.317
Couldn't have put
it better myself.

37:57.318 --> 38:01.112
That's absolutely it.
I agree with that profoundly.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.198
Huh!

38:02.364 --> 38:03.407
Milk?

38:03.532 --> 38:04.533
Yes.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.701
Sugar?
No.

38:06.702 --> 38:07.745
Boyfriend?

38:07.870 --> 38:08.954
Yes!

38:09.121 --> 38:11.290
No. No, you don't
have a boyfriend.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.877
Do I not look like
I'd have a boyfriend?

38:15.002 --> 38:16.628
Do I look like I'd
never get a boyfriend?

38:16.629 --> 38:18.630
No. That's the rudest
thing I've ever heard.

38:18.631 --> 38:21.467
I didn't mean it like that.
I just didn't expect...

38:22.635 --> 38:24.720
Is it quite a new boyfriend?

38:24.887 --> 38:25.888
Yes.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.390
There he is.
Rupert.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.227
Yes. He's so cute.
Rupert?

38:31.352 --> 38:32.686
Hi, guys.

38:33.062 --> 38:34.897
Sorry I'm late, with my dad.

38:36.232 --> 38:37.233
Hi, Rupee.

38:38.526 --> 38:39.527
"Rupee"?

38:41.070 --> 38:43.239
Well, this is Tim and

38:43.364 --> 38:45.241
we don't know him at all.

38:45.908 --> 38:48.536
Hey, I was thinking we could
take in a film after this.

38:48.661 --> 38:50.287
Get some mixed popcorn,
share a Coke,

38:50.412 --> 38:51.539
snuggle.
Okay.

38:51.914 --> 38:52.997
Okay.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.710
When did you two meet?
Exactly?

38:57.253 --> 38:59.255
Well, it was only
a week ago, actually.

39:00.047 --> 39:02.883
It's all been a bit of a
whirlwind, hasn't it, poochy face?

39:03.216 --> 39:04.801
I'm gonna have to
teach you what you can

39:04.802 --> 39:06.262
and can't say in
front of people.

39:06.428 --> 39:07.929
No "poochy face"?
No.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.932
No. Definitely not.

39:10.099 --> 39:14.103
Come on, then. More details about
this wonderful first meeting?

39:14.228 --> 39:15.271
Okay, okay.

39:15.437 --> 39:17.565
It was, um, what...
Joanna?

39:18.107 --> 39:19.608
Oh, June 17th.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.277
And Jo was
having a little party.

39:22.111 --> 39:25.281
A living hell from which
Rupert, thank God, rescued me.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.575
And where was
this terrible party?

39:27.700 --> 39:29.785
My brothel of a flat.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.578
Which is where, though? That's
the question, isn't it.

39:31.579 --> 39:33.122
What are you, a detective?

39:33.539 --> 39:35.957
No, sorry, I've just got
a very visual imagination.

39:35.958 --> 39:37.877
I like to imagine
stuff completely.

39:39.044 --> 39:43.215
26 Courtfield Gardens,
SW5. Around 8:30.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.968
Dress code, slutty.
Will that do?

39:46.135 --> 39:47.969
Absolutely, yes.
Although I am wondering

39:47.970 --> 39:51.056
when you got there, Rupert.
Early, late?

39:51.473 --> 39:54.643
On time, I think.
True love was calling.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.437
Oh, God.

39:56.729 --> 39:58.981
I actually feel a bit
sick now. Just these

39:59.148 --> 40:01.400
muffins, I think.
Never trust a blueberry.

40:02.818 --> 40:04.403
Okay, I'll be back in a tick.

40:05.821 --> 40:07.781
You two are such
a lovely couple.

40:12.161 --> 40:13.329
Bit weird.

40:13.454 --> 40:14.622
He's cute.

40:14.747 --> 40:15.748
I like him.

40:15.873 --> 40:16.916
Yeah, me too.

40:48.155 --> 40:50.199
Oh, hello. Do I know you?

40:50.366 --> 40:53.827
No, no, no.
I'm a friend of Mary's.

40:54.370 --> 40:58.039
She has another friend? Gosh,
you amaze me. But hooray.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.792
Ooh. Hotdog?

41:00.209 --> 41:01.585
Took me hours.
Made them myself.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.045
Thanks.

41:04.672 --> 41:07.216
Disgusting.
Totally undercooked.

41:07.341 --> 41:08.676
See you later.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.227
Why don't we go upstairs,
it's a bit quieter?

41:33.033 --> 41:34.910
Hi.
Hi.

41:35.077 --> 41:36.078
I'm Tim.

41:36.870 --> 41:37.913
Mary.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.748
That's my mother's name.
Let's not get into that.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.417
Um...

41:42.418 --> 41:44.253
I know this is forward but

41:44.378 --> 41:48.424
your face tells me that you're finding
this party to be a living hell.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.051
So, I just wondered
if you might come

41:52.052 --> 41:55.389
and have a bite to
eat with me instead?

41:56.098 --> 41:57.349
Right now.

41:57.683 --> 41:58.891
I'm sorry?

41:58.892 --> 42:01.437
Obviously, I should have
thought this through more.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.105
Let's talk about Kate Moss.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.110
I love Kate Moss.

42:08.277 --> 42:10.946
I always think the key thing
with her is the history,

42:11.363 --> 42:15.576
you know, the informality of her early
shots compared to high fashion stuff

42:15.701 --> 42:18.871
so you always know that underneath
she's still just the same

42:19.288 --> 42:22.458
cheeky normal girl
naked on the beach.

42:22.583 --> 42:23.584
The beach.

42:24.126 --> 42:26.795
I agree with you completely.

42:27.087 --> 42:30.132
If we leave now then we can have,
you know, more than one starter.

42:30.591 --> 42:32.634
Oh!

42:35.387 --> 42:37.056
I love your eyes.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.935
And I love the rest
of your face, too.

42:52.154 --> 42:53.906
More than one starter?

42:54.031 --> 42:55.741
10 amazing starters.

42:56.825 --> 42:58.744
After you.
Thanks.

42:58.911 --> 43:01.162
Ten minutes is long enough
for any party, I think.

43:01.163 --> 43:03.164
Yeah.

43:03.165 --> 43:04.500
Especially that one.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.168
Evening, all.

43:06.335 --> 43:08.670
God!
What a dickhead.

43:09.797 --> 43:10.838
Yeah.

43:10.839 --> 43:12.091
Ugh.

43:13.801 --> 43:16.303
So, what do you do?

43:17.679 --> 43:20.014
I'm a reader at a publisher.

43:20.015 --> 43:22.684
No! You read for a living?

43:23.352 --> 43:26.146
Yes, that's it. I read.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.815
Oh, that's so great.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.025
It's like someone asking,
"What do you do

43:30.150 --> 43:31.985
for a living?"
"Well, I breathe.

43:32.111 --> 43:35.197
"I'm a breather,
I get paid for breathing."

43:35.697 --> 43:36.697
How did you get that job?

43:36.698 --> 43:39.326
Okay, smart-ass,
what do you do?

43:40.369 --> 43:42.204
I am a lawyer.

43:42.538 --> 43:43.871
Sort of. Sort of.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.541
That's sexy.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.376
Is it?

43:47.501 --> 43:48.877
I mean, I think so.

43:49.795 --> 43:54.049
In a suit, in a court, saving
people's lives. Kinda sexy.

43:54.383 --> 43:56.509
I guess it is. Although it's
not as sexy as reading.

43:56.510 --> 43:59.888
Sitting there in an office,
in a little chair reading.

44:00.055 --> 44:01.556
Okay, stop.
Ooh!

44:01.557 --> 44:03.307
Just wait right there,
mister, because

44:03.308 --> 44:05.894
a lot of books get
submitted to my publisher.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.729
So it's an immense
responsibility.

44:07.855 --> 44:09.564
I bet it is.

44:09.565 --> 44:11.567
But when you do normal reading,

44:12.401 --> 44:15.362
is it ruined because it's your job?
You know, like prostitutes?

44:15.487 --> 44:17.697
I always worry that when
they stop being prostitutes

44:17.698 --> 44:19.074
that they can't
enjoy sex any more.

44:19.199 --> 44:20.658
You always worry about that?

44:20.659 --> 44:21.784
No, I sometimes worry about it.

44:21.785 --> 44:22.869
Oh, good. Okay.

44:22.870 --> 44:25.663
Because someone who always worried
about that would be a bit of a worry.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.915
When you read a newspaper, do you
think, "Forget this, it's work"?

44:27.916 --> 44:29.917
Have you interviewed
a lot of prostitutes?

44:29.918 --> 44:31.919
When you read a menu,
do you think,

44:31.920 --> 44:35.090
"No, I'm not reading this,
unless you pay me hard cash."

44:35.215 --> 44:38.927
How many prostitutes will you need to
talk to before this issue is solved?

44:39.094 --> 44:43.015
Are you planning to head to
Eastern Europe and Thailand?

44:57.196 --> 44:58.446
Um...

44:58.447 --> 45:00.949
Would you like to
walk me to my car?

45:01.074 --> 45:03.577
Yes. Why not?
Okay.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.746
Sounds like a good idea.

45:06.455 --> 45:07.788
What about you?

45:07.789 --> 45:10.876
Yeah, I have
three older brothers.

45:11.084 --> 45:12.627
Oh, God.
Yeah.

45:12.628 --> 45:14.213
Where are they?

45:15.797 --> 45:17.382
Behind you.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.893
Did you have trouble parking?

45:30.729 --> 45:32.314
Pardon?

45:32.439 --> 45:33.982
It's just such
a long way to your car.

45:34.149 --> 45:36.568
Well, my car's
actually parked outside

45:36.693 --> 45:39.154
my house.
I got a lift to the party.

45:41.490 --> 45:42.491
Okay.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.411
That's good.
That's perfect.

45:46.828 --> 45:47.829
Okay.

45:52.584 --> 45:54.628
And here we are.

45:54.753 --> 45:56.672
My God.
Yeah.

45:56.797 --> 46:00.133
Car, house.
House, car.

46:02.469 --> 46:04.638
It makes perfect sense.

46:04.930 --> 46:06.598
It's very logical.

46:27.953 --> 46:29.036
Christ.

46:31.373 --> 46:32.582
Um...

46:35.377 --> 46:36.545
Keys!

46:50.976 --> 46:54.980
I'm gonna go into the bedroom
and put on my new pyjamas.

46:55.355 --> 46:56.356
Right.

46:57.399 --> 47:00.694
And then in a minute you can
come in and take them off.

47:01.653 --> 47:03.405
If you want to.

47:13.582 --> 47:15.083
One minute.

47:20.005 --> 47:21.006
Hi.

47:24.593 --> 47:26.761
Oh! God. Are you...

47:26.762 --> 47:28.430
Are you okay?
Yeah.

47:30.766 --> 47:31.850
Sorry.

47:31.975 --> 47:33.060
That's okay.

47:56.958 --> 47:59.628
Oh, it's a front opener.

47:59.753 --> 48:01.338
It's a what?

48:01.463 --> 48:03.131
It opens from the front.

48:04.299 --> 48:06.426
Yeah, no, yeah, of course.

48:06.593 --> 48:08.136
Thanks.
Sure.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.307
Ooh! Oh! Well done.

48:20.649 --> 48:22.984
I'm sure it'll be
better next time.

48:24.486 --> 48:26.988
I thought it was pretty lovely.

48:27.739 --> 48:30.158
Right, no,
it was really lovely.

48:32.494 --> 48:35.163
In fact, can you
just give me one minute?

48:36.623 --> 48:37.624
Okay.

48:43.755 --> 48:44.756
Hi.

48:47.426 --> 48:48.677
Dangerous.

48:52.180 --> 48:55.100
Oh! You really
know your bras.

48:56.017 --> 48:57.060
I like to think so.

49:02.524 --> 49:06.695
Well done. Some people make a
real mess of it the first time.

49:06.820 --> 49:08.280
Amateurs.

49:10.532 --> 49:12.701
Could you give me one second?

49:13.785 --> 49:14.786
Sure.

49:15.954 --> 49:17.288
I couldn't wait.

49:17.289 --> 49:18.415
Oh!

49:19.291 --> 49:21.542
My goodness.

49:26.381 --> 49:28.675
Best night of my entire life.

49:30.098 --> 49:31.802
And now I've got
a suspicion I'm gonna have

49:31.803 --> 49:34.639
the best sleep
of my entire life.

49:36.308 --> 49:39.478
So once is enough
for my perfect guy?

49:40.312 --> 49:42.981
I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.

49:49.404 --> 49:50.989
We're late.
No, we're not.

49:52.491 --> 49:55.117
It'll be fine. It's only...
Oh, my God.

50:06.630 --> 50:07.631
Bye.

50:15.847 --> 50:17.087
Don't worry,
you're coming with.

50:21.311 --> 50:22.479
Oh!

50:23.772 --> 50:25.106
I'm taking you home!

50:25.690 --> 50:26.775
Ahh!

50:30.946 --> 50:32.697
Bye. Bye.
Bye.

50:34.533 --> 50:35.534
No!

51:21.538 --> 51:23.832
Okay. I have
some bad news.

51:24.541 --> 51:26.709
You're dying?
No, not that bad.

51:26.710 --> 51:28.503
I'm dying?
No.

51:28.670 --> 51:32.173
My parents are in town. They're
visiting and they're coming around.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.383
Oh, God. Parents?
American parents?

51:34.384 --> 51:35.551
Mmm-hmm.

51:35.552 --> 51:37.012
When?
Now.

51:37.345 --> 51:39.139
They told me and
I didn't tell you

51:39.312 --> 51:42.057
and I thought they'd cancel because
they normally do and they didn't.

51:42.058 --> 51:43.892
Now now?
Now now.

51:43.893 --> 51:45.494
So you should probably
put on some pants.

51:46.521 --> 51:48.981
Oh! God. Okay, okay.

51:48.982 --> 51:50.232
Um...

51:50.233 --> 51:51.651
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.194
Do they know I exist?

51:53.361 --> 51:57.573
Uh... Yeah. I've mentioned something
like you, but nothing very specific.

51:57.574 --> 52:01.452
Yeah, they're quite conservative,
so maybe not those pants.

52:03.872 --> 52:05.540
Okay. Yeah.

52:05.749 --> 52:08.710
On! on, God. Okay.

52:10.879 --> 52:13.590
Could you just stall them.
Stall them.

52:16.676 --> 52:17.677
Come on up.

52:18.178 --> 52:19.387
What?

52:19.512 --> 52:20.722
I'm sorry,
they don't like waiting.

52:20.847 --> 52:22.557
Okay. Do I live here?

52:22.682 --> 52:24.351
Definitely not.

52:24.893 --> 52:26.478
Are we having sex?

52:26.603 --> 52:28.229
Yeah. But not oral.

52:28.396 --> 52:29.731
I wasn't gonna mention oral.

52:29.856 --> 52:31.273
Okay, good, don't.

52:31.274 --> 52:32.609
How did you think
that was gonna come up?

52:32.734 --> 52:34.134
Could you help me
with this, please?

52:34.235 --> 52:37.405
I don't know. If it does,
just deny it completely.

52:37.572 --> 52:39.574
Who's gonna bring it up?
Your dad?

52:39.699 --> 52:42.410
"Tim, had any cunnilingus
with my daughter recently?"

52:42.535 --> 52:43.787
Well, you never know.

52:43.912 --> 52:45.205
Okay.

52:45.747 --> 52:47.915
Okay. Ready?
Yeah.

52:49.084 --> 52:51.086
They're there.
Oh, they are, yeah.

52:51.252 --> 52:52.921
Yeah, right behind you.
Okay. Right, okay.

52:56.257 --> 52:58.093
Dad!
Hello, sweet.

52:58.301 --> 53:00.469
Mom. Hi.
Hi, honey.

53:00.470 --> 53:02.931
Oh, this is Tim.

53:03.098 --> 53:05.141
Hello, sir. Ma'am.

53:05.725 --> 53:08.603
Should we come back when you
haven't got any company, or...

53:09.771 --> 53:12.023
Well, that would be
quite difficult

53:12.148 --> 53:14.442
because Tim
actually lives here.

53:15.944 --> 53:18.279
Really? With you?

53:18.613 --> 53:22.283
Yes. Yeah, but no
oral sex, I promise you.

53:24.119 --> 53:25.620
I beg your pardon?

53:26.579 --> 53:28.081
Excuse me.

53:29.457 --> 53:33.128
So, Tim, tell us where are you
from, which part of the country?

53:33.753 --> 53:36.339
He's from Cornwall.
Yeah, it's really pretty.

53:36.464 --> 53:40.135
It's that little bit right at the
end, sort of looks like a shoe.

53:40.802 --> 53:42.262
And you're a lawyer,
is that right?

53:43.138 --> 53:45.347
Yep, that's right.
And he never loses.

53:45.348 --> 53:47.183
You don't think he's
gonna win, then he just

53:47.308 --> 53:48.684
pulls something
out of the bag and,

53:48.685 --> 53:50.018
what do you know,
he wins again.

53:50.019 --> 53:53.314
Do you ever answer
any of your own questions?

53:53.481 --> 53:55.190
I, uh...

53:55.191 --> 53:57.861
Yes, he does.
Usually he does,

53:57.986 --> 53:59.319
but not today because I'm doing

53:59.320 --> 54:00.960
all the talking
because I'm really nervous

54:01.281 --> 54:05.994
and I kinda love him and I just...
I want you to, too.

54:06.119 --> 54:07.662
Oh, honey.

54:07.954 --> 54:10.457
Sorry. Tim.
Over to you.

54:10.957 --> 54:11.958
Shoot

54:13.668 --> 54:14.878
Yeah, I think my dad...

54:14.879 --> 54:16.086
Can I just say one more thing?

54:16.087 --> 54:17.172
Um...

54:17.714 --> 54:19.549
Thank God that's over.

54:19.674 --> 54:21.008
I got given two tickets

54:21.009 --> 54:23.343
for the National Theatre
tomorrow. Do you wanna come?

54:23.344 --> 54:27.348
Oh, no, so not. I'm just
gonna sleep all day.

54:27.807 --> 54:31.352
I don't see why going to the theatre
should get in the way of that.

54:31.478 --> 54:32.936
Many of the best sleeps
of my life have happened

54:32.937 --> 54:34.856
in the Royal
Shakespeare Company.

54:35.315 --> 54:37.525
No, you take someone else.

54:37.692 --> 54:41.529
I really like bed and
I really hate theatre.

54:41.988 --> 54:43.364
Quite right.

54:44.491 --> 54:48.161
But what kind of sad act is gonna
be free on a Saturday night

54:48.745 --> 54:50.871
with no day's notice?

54:52.040 --> 54:53.041
Bravo.

54:55.752 --> 54:58.213
Oh, my God. It's Charlotte. Who?

54:58.713 --> 55:00.548
It was my first love.
Where?

55:00.715 --> 55:02.758
There. Under
the "exit" sign.

55:02.759 --> 55:04.510
- The old woman?
- No, not the old woman.

55:04.511 --> 55:05.844
The astonishing blonde.

55:05.845 --> 55:07.596
The one with the dark hair?
No, blonde.

55:07.597 --> 55:09.224
Blonde means
blonde hair, doesn't it?

55:10.391 --> 55:11.935
Off the stage.

55:12.352 --> 55:14.604
Okay, you stay there.
I mean it, stay!

55:27.033 --> 55:28.034
Charlotte.

55:29.077 --> 55:31.079
Oh, my God. Tim.

55:31.621 --> 55:34.123
How fabulous to see you.

55:35.124 --> 55:36.458
Wow. I...

55:36.459 --> 55:38.460
This is my girlfriend Tina.

55:38.461 --> 55:39.754
No. Oh!

55:41.464 --> 55:44.132
That is so brilliant.
Well, hello, Tina.

55:44.133 --> 55:45.760
Why is it brilliant?

55:45.885 --> 55:47.220
Well, you know.
There are certain

55:47.345 --> 55:48.638
moments in your life
that scar you for life.

55:48.763 --> 55:51.766
Charlotte's rejection of me
was one of those moments,

55:51.933 --> 55:54.643
but now I know she's
got a "girlfriend," well,

55:54.644 --> 55:57.312
that's just a huge burden
suddenly lifted off my mind.

55:57.313 --> 56:00.316
I can be a confident
heterosexual all over again.

56:01.943 --> 56:04.571
Not that kind of girlfriend.

56:06.239 --> 56:07.240
What?

56:07.991 --> 56:09.617
You think I'm gay?

56:10.743 --> 56:11.744
No.

56:12.245 --> 56:15.998
No, of course not.
No. It's girl friend.

56:15.999 --> 56:18.000
Yes. No. Wow.

56:18.001 --> 56:21.462
Yeah, friend who is a girl,
which you so clearly are.

56:21.629 --> 56:25.425
I'm just gonna go and get my
boyfriend, who is a boy...

56:31.598 --> 56:33.766
Oh, my God. Tim.

56:34.309 --> 56:37.185
How lovely to see you.
Look at you. Wow.

56:37.186 --> 56:38.979
This is my girlfriend Tina.

56:38.980 --> 56:40.064
Oh.

56:40.607 --> 56:42.317
Hello, Tina.
Although you should be

56:42.442 --> 56:44.152
a little careful
with that, by the way.

56:44.277 --> 56:47.322
There are still quite a lot of
us old fashioned types about

56:47.447 --> 56:49.657
who interpret "girlfriend"
as meaning "gay."

56:49.782 --> 56:51.200
So if you say that
Tina's your girlfriend,

56:51.326 --> 56:52.766
people will assume
that you're "gay."

56:53.995 --> 56:55.455
I am "gay".

56:56.456 --> 56:57.665
Are you?

56:57.832 --> 56:59.072
Do you have
a problem with that?

56:59.834 --> 57:02.712
No, I don't.
I love that stuff.

57:03.504 --> 57:04.672
I'm just gonna...

57:07.175 --> 57:08.176
Wow.

57:08.676 --> 57:11.512
I've just seen the girl who broke
my heart three summers ago.

57:11.638 --> 57:13.514
Let's go say hello.

57:13.640 --> 57:15.516
No. Best let sleeping dogs lie.
Come on.

57:15.683 --> 57:18.143
Best night of my life.
I always love this area.

57:18.144 --> 57:20.521
It's so bustling and I mean
those pictures, full of colour.

57:20.688 --> 57:22.731
Just makes me so happy when I'm
round here, all the colour...

57:22.732 --> 57:23.857
Tim.

57:23.858 --> 57:25.193
Oh, Charlotte!

57:25.318 --> 57:26.694
Tim, how lovely to see you.

57:26.819 --> 57:28.403
What a surprise.

57:28.404 --> 57:31.366
Wow. Sorry. This is
my girlfriend, Tina.

57:31.532 --> 57:33.368
She's gay.
Shut up.

57:33.493 --> 57:34.702
Hello, Tina.

57:34.827 --> 57:36.037
Look at you!

57:36.162 --> 57:37.997
It just never
even occurred to me

57:38.122 --> 57:39.916
you existed
outside of Cornwall.

57:40.708 --> 57:42.877
We're about to
go and get dinner,

57:43.002 --> 57:45.088
but it would be great
to hang out sometime.

57:45.213 --> 57:47.048
Yeah, sure. I'd love that.

57:47.215 --> 57:49.008
Send my love to little Kit Kat.
How is she?

57:49.550 --> 57:53.054
She's okay. She's not finding
London totally easy actually.

57:53.221 --> 57:55.390
Right. Well, Jimmy says
he sees her sometimes.

57:55.682 --> 57:57.100
Really? Since when?

57:57.225 --> 57:59.268
You knew there was
always something there.

57:59.394 --> 58:01.062
Sorry, you are?

58:01.229 --> 58:02.230
Very well, thank you.

58:02.397 --> 58:03.437
Well, she means your name.

58:03.564 --> 58:04.899
Oh. Roger.
No, it's not.

58:05.024 --> 58:07.442
No, it's not. It's Rory.

58:07.443 --> 58:09.362
Nice to meet you, Rory.
Yeah.

58:10.071 --> 58:11.781
Right. Sorry,
we should get going.

58:11.906 --> 58:13.323
It was really great to see you.

58:13.324 --> 58:14.742
I'll see you soon.
You, too. Yeah.

58:15.243 --> 58:16.244
Bye.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.454
God, she is beautiful.

58:19.914 --> 58:23.584
She's so beautiful, if you had sex
with her, you'd die. You'd just die.

58:23.710 --> 58:27.088
You'd open her shirt, see her breasts
and your eyes would explode.

58:27.213 --> 58:29.589
You'd have to have sex with her blind.
And then you'd die.

58:29.590 --> 58:32.135
You notice she didn't
give me her number...

58:32.260 --> 58:36.139
I told Tina to go have dinner on her own.
Are you hungry?

58:36.264 --> 58:38.766
Yeah. Of course.
Great.

58:39.225 --> 58:40.768
Bye, Roger.

58:41.060 --> 58:42.729
Oh. Yeah, excellent.

58:42.927 --> 58:44.312
Thanks again for the play.
Triumph.

58:44.313 --> 58:45.593
Where do you wanna go?

58:45.815 --> 58:48.316
Well, wherever you like really.

58:48.317 --> 58:50.778
I can't compete.

59:02.248 --> 59:03.332
You know,

59:03.666 --> 59:07.628
I'm starting to think we slightly
wasted that summer holiday.

59:08.463 --> 59:11.174
If we could
travel back in time,

59:11.299 --> 59:13.843
maybe I wouldn't have said no.

59:15.762 --> 59:16.763
I'm...

59:17.638 --> 59:19.640
I'm just staying
round the corner.

59:19.766 --> 59:21.309
Can you walk me home?

59:22.935 --> 59:23.936
Yeah.

59:24.520 --> 59:26.355
Yeah?
Yeah, of course, yeah.

59:36.324 --> 59:38.867
Well, here we are.

59:38.868 --> 59:40.328
Mmm.

59:44.165 --> 59:46.000
It's a lot nicer

59:46.417 --> 59:47.585
inside.

59:48.294 --> 59:49.837
I'm sure it is.

59:50.046 --> 59:51.214
Mmm-hmm.

59:57.011 --> 59:59.013
So...
So...

01:00:00.181 --> 01:00:01.182
So...

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:04.352
So,

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:06.104
lovely

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:09.357
to see you, Charlotte.

01:00:09.482 --> 01:00:13.194
What a night.
Total joy, but I've gotta

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:15.696
get back

01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:19.867
because there's something very important
that I have to do. Right now.

01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:54.569
Wake up.
Mmm...

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:56.362
Wake up.
What?

01:00:56.529 --> 01:00:57.530
Mary.

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:00.740
Would you like to marry me?

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:01.951
Shh.

01:01:02.243 --> 01:01:06.247
Don't be so selfish,
I'm sleeping. It's bad.

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:09.375
Right.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.170
That went very well.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:20.928
Wake up.

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:22.096
What?

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:25.765
Wake up. Come
and have a chat.

01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:26.767
Why?

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:30.354
I've got something
important to ask you.

01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:35.276
Can't it wait till morning?

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:37.236
Not really.

01:01:38.196 --> 01:01:41.199
But I'm so comfy.

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:44.368
I was having
the loveliest dream.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.746
What is it?

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:49.957
Why is there music on?

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:53.127
It's got something to do
with what I want to ask you.

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:56.631
Wait a minute.

01:01:57.465 --> 01:01:59.425
Romantic music.

01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:03.304
Guy with important question.

01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:05.097
Are you on your knees?

01:02:05.598 --> 01:02:07.600
On his knees.

01:02:08.017 --> 01:02:09.143
Mmm.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.271
Were you so bored in
the play you decided

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.149
to ask me to
marry you afterwards?

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:17.442
Huh?

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:19.111
Something like that.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.408
Yeah. Exactly that.

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.119
In fact,

01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:31.999
will you marry me?

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:40.508
Any thoughts on the answer?

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:45.137
"Yes?" "No?" "Get out of my life,
loser." They're all possible.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:51.352
I think I'll go for

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.021
"yes."

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.988
Thank you for asking me.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:07.159
And thank you for not going for one
of those melodramatic proposals

01:03:07.285 --> 01:03:09.662
with lots of people around.

01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:12.123
I hate other people.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.833
Me, too.

01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:15.543
Yeah.

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:19.380
I'm just gonna
turn off the radio.

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:22.049
Okay. Good idea.

01:03:29.724 --> 01:03:32.893
Thanks, guys.
Sorry, she's a bit tired.

01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:37.815
But we really appreciate it.
Can you go?

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.242
Wow!

01:03:48.576 --> 01:03:50.578
That's so beautiful.

01:03:50.703 --> 01:03:53.413
I don't think we'll be staying
in the same room, somehow.

01:03:53.414 --> 01:03:54.748
Oh, really?

01:03:54.749 --> 01:03:57.752
Oh, if they offer you tea,
just say no.

01:03:58.544 --> 01:03:59.920
Hello.

01:04:00.046 --> 01:04:01.422
Mum, this is Mary.

01:04:01.547 --> 01:04:02.882
Mary!
Hi.

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:04.592
Good Lord, you're pretty.

01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:06.344
Oh, no, it's just

01:04:06.761 --> 01:04:09.263
I've got a lot of
mascara and lipstick on.

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:10.765
Let's have a look.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.434
Oh, yes. Good.

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:17.437
It's very bad for
a girl to be too pretty.

01:04:17.438 --> 01:04:21.609
It stops her developing a sense of humour.
Or a personality.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.361
Tea?

01:04:23.778 --> 01:04:25.321
I'd love a cup of tea.

01:04:25.446 --> 01:04:27.031
Oh, Christ,
that's the whole day gone.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.785
She's a very special guest.
Cup without the crack.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.243
Oh. Skipping stones.

01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:34.955
They've been doing this
since he was about this high.

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:38.833
And what are your faults?
I mean, little weaknesses.

01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:40.711
Oh. Uh...

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:43.714
I, uh...

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.551
Well, I'm very insecure.

01:04:47.802 --> 01:04:49.095
Sweet.

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:54.100
Okay. I've a very
bad temper sometimes.

01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:55.893
Crucial.
How else are you gonna

01:04:56.018 --> 01:04:57.811
get a fella to
do what you want?

01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:02.316
And, of course, I have...

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:04.110
I have a weakness for your son.

01:05:04.235 --> 01:05:05.611
So do I.

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:09.657
But best not to tell him.
Don't want him getting cocky.

01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:14.828
Pow!

01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:17.164
I'm so good
without the ball. Pow!

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:20.500
What do you think of her?

01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:22.128
I like her more
than you already.

01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:28.509
Oh, look, I'd forgotten this.
Jimmy Fontana <i>Il Mondo.</i>

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:30.677
Greatest record ever
recorded by an Italian

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:32.471
who looks like he's got
a dead badger on his head.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:33.806
And you've got the album.

01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.141
Yes!

01:05:35.266 --> 01:05:36.851
Check out those specs!

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:42.523
Come on, on with the game!
Right.

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:44.775
And what an extraordinary
game this is.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.819
For the first time
a father and son

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:48.696
are playing each other
in the World Table

01:05:48.863 --> 01:05:50.697
Tennis Final and
neither of them are Chinese.

01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:53.366
Tremendous play from the old
World Champion and his son,

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:56.084
the first openly ginger
British table tennis player

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.246
but there are signs the
youngster's beginning to crack.

01:05:58.247 --> 01:05:59.372
There are tears in his eyes.

01:05:59.373 --> 01:06:00.749
There are not!

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:02.334
There soon will be!

01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:07.882
Hey.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.177
Hey!
I didn't know you were here.

01:06:11.844 --> 01:06:14.387
Yeah. I just
popped down for a while.

01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:15.556
Okay.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:17.141
What about the job?

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:18.893
Oh.

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:20.560
So how long have you been here?

01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:22.354
Couple of weeks.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.732
Gosh! So,
life in London...

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:26.734
Horrid.

01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:27.902
Okay.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.237
Is Mary here?

01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:32.406
Yes.

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:34.074
Where?
Downstairs.

01:06:35.242 --> 01:06:37.244
You be gentle.

01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:39.747
Be gentle!

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:44.042
Oh!

01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:45.377
Oh, careful!

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:50.549
Yeah, nice to see you, too. I'm
trying to make a good impression...

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.634
Yeah, you make a good impression.

01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:55.262
Right, sorry.
Sorry.

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:57.932
I've got an important
announcement to make.

01:06:58.057 --> 01:06:59.767
- Exciting.
- Mmm.

01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:03.561
We've decided, after a little
bit of thought, to get married.

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:09.109
That's wonderful news.

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:10.903
Who are you getting married to?

01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:13.906
To Mary. Over there.

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:16.033
Oh, thank God for that.

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:19.245
Jolly embarrassing if it had
been another girl. Imagine that.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:21.455
We're so pleased.

01:07:21.956 --> 01:07:23.582
Oh, no, sorry.
Uh... Yeah.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:26.794
By the way, the wedding
will be quite soon

01:07:27.795 --> 01:07:29.713
because we're
having a baby, too.

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:38.472
You're pregnant?

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:39.765
Yes.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:41.475
Who's the father?

01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:43.811
Well, Tim, I hope.

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:48.232
Thank God for that. Jolly awkward
if it had been another fellow.

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:53.487
We have to decide tonight.

01:07:53.612 --> 01:07:55.322
What?
Everything.

01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:58.241
The only thing
you've decided about our

01:07:58.242 --> 01:08:00.243
wedding is that I'm
coming down the aisle

01:08:00.244 --> 01:08:02.454
to the sound of
some Italian weirdo

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.831
singing a song called <i>Il Mondo.</i>

01:08:04.832 --> 01:08:05.832
Excellent song.

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:08.167
To which I've said
a definitive "no."

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:09.837
So here's the deal.

01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:13.507
I will take off one item of clothing
for every decision you make.

01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:17.678
Okay. You have my attention,
young lady.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:19.305
Right, um,

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.057
where would you
like to get married?

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:25.978
Home. I'd hate
anywhere else.

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:27.104
Okay.

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:29.648
Oh, my God.
Good.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.189
Who should the priest be?

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.693
It'll have to be
the local bloke

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:34.457
with yellow teeth and
the massive unibrow.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:35.696
Okay.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.823
That's a lock for Hagrid.

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:41.327
Um...

01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:42.786
Best Man?

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:43.996
Damn.

01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:45.788
Best Man. Now.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:47.707
Oh, no, this is so hard.
It's lose-lose, you know.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.334
You piss off all
the ones you don't pick,

01:08:49.335 --> 01:08:50.835
and you end up
hating the one you do pick

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:52.962
because he makes a bad
speech and ruins the day.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.506
Do you wanna see
these puppies or not?

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.175
Yes, I do.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.886
Jay.
It's your choice.

01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:00.553
He's my best friend,
but he's a moron.

01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:02.055
Yeah, he will
mess up everything.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:03.390
Rory.
Sure?

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:04.850
No, Harry.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:06.310
Harry it is.
Let's do this.

01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:09.854
Oh, Rory. Sorry.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.481
What? That's such a cheat.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:14.026
Okay, fine.

01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.527
Honeymoon?

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:17.737
Bed and breakfast in Scotland.

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:20.198
I am not taking
my pants off for Scotland.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.908
But it's all we can afford.
Take off your pants.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:24.036
I will not.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:25.245
Take off your pants!

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:27.706
I want two weeks in Bali!

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.166
Take off those pants!

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:38.050
Have you planned a break?
No.

01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:49.269
Oh, no!

01:09:52.398 --> 01:09:53.482
Is that you?

01:09:53.816 --> 01:09:55.150
It wasn't me.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.293
It's for you.

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.121
No, I'm caught!
I've got it. I've got it!

01:10:49.538 --> 01:10:50.664
Help me!

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:52.039
Oh!

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:56.795
Yes!

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:02.008
Right, follow me!

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:05.846
My gosh!

01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:09.265
Oh, my God!

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.309
Oh!

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:13.060
Oh, God!

01:11:20.027 --> 01:11:21.236
It's a joke!

01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:25.866
Here.

01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:32.498
Yes, come on.

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:34.041
This way.

01:11:49.181 --> 01:11:50.891
Oh, my God!

01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:18.335
Hello,

01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:20.170
I'm Rory.

01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:25.717
When Tim asked me to
be his Best Man, I was terrified.

01:12:25.843 --> 01:12:28.554
So I thought best
thing is to find

01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:31.390
a book about speeches.
And here it is.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:35.936
And it says think of
really funny anecdotes.

01:12:36.854 --> 01:12:41.817
And there is a very hilarious
story, actually from work.

01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:45.487
It was quite a complicated
case based on an issue of

01:12:45.612 --> 01:12:47.530
cross-amortisation
of ownership of

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:49.116
post-divorce
properties and, um...

01:12:51.243 --> 01:12:54.079
Let me just explain the context.
The Defendant...

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:00.127
When Tim asked me
to do his Best Man speech,

01:13:00.252 --> 01:13:02.504
my immediate reaction was,

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:04.630
"How much are you gonna
pay me, you little shit?"

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:07.008
"I don't write
for free, you know."

01:13:07.009 --> 01:13:10.137
These were the girls available
to him at that time.

01:13:10.262 --> 01:13:13.515
"Hello, girls." And this is how
far he got with each of them.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.809
Let me explain the code.
5, blowjob.

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:21.690
8, full penetrative...

01:13:21.815 --> 01:13:23.650
...and so a toast

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.736
to the man with
the worst haircut

01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:27.821
but the best bride in the room.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.032
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tim and Mary.

01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:32.159
Tim and Mary.

01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:34.036
That's us.

01:13:34.995 --> 01:13:36.955
I wish I'd said
"I love you."

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.749
You did, Dad.

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.417
It was implied.

01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:44.630
I'm not sure "implied" is good
enough for a wedding day, are you?

01:13:44.755 --> 01:13:46.924
No, don't do it, it's fine.

01:13:47.049 --> 01:13:50.886
I'm so happy with it as it was.
You really don't have to.

01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:53.305
I'll do what
I wanna do, young man.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.682
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.520
...later on
I may tell you about

01:14:00.646 --> 01:14:05.025
Tim's many failings as a man
and as a table tennis player.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.151
But,

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.779
important first to say the one

01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:13.283
big thing, I've only loved

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:16.745
three men in my life.

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:19.247
My dad was
a frosty bugger so that

01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:21.416
only leaves dear Uncle Desmond,

01:14:23.961 --> 01:14:27.714
B.B. King, obviously,
and this young man here.

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:32.761
I'd only give one piece of
advice to anyone marrying.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:36.306
We're all quite
similar in the end.

01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:40.142
We all get old and tell the
same tales too many times.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:43.480
But try and marry someone

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:45.899
kind.

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:48.986
And this is a kind man

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:51.405
with a good heart.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.658
I'm not particularly proud

01:14:54.783 --> 01:14:58.412
of many things in my life,
but I am very proud

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.082
to be the father of my son.

01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:10.006
I'm so sorry to disturb you, but I
wonder if I could have your autograph.

01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:12.050
No. No.

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:13.968
I'm at a wedding,
for God's sake.

01:15:13.969 --> 01:15:16.304
I'm here to
celebrate true love not

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:18.807
scribble my illegible
signature on stupid

01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:21.309
bits of paper that
you can flog on eBay

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:24.604
so that at the next wedding you
can wear a less hideous hat.

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:27.189
I see you've met my Aunt May.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.986
Oh, God. People should
wear name tags.

01:15:32.112 --> 01:15:34.197
You next, Kittle Kattie.

01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:37.451
I don't know, Uncle D.

01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:41.163
Boys aren't very nice.

01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:43.290
Aren't they, darling?

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:45.667
Not in my experience.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:48.795
They're always
taking liberties,

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:51.006
not giving much back in return.

01:15:54.843 --> 01:15:56.386
It's yummy.
Yeah?

01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:58.638
I like the way
you say 'yummy.'

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.732
Do you wish we'd picked
another less wet day?

01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:10.734
No.

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.695
Not for the world.

01:16:14.863 --> 01:16:15.946
Phew.

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:21.203
And so it begins.

01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:24.581
Lots and lots of types of days.

01:16:25.499 --> 01:16:26.500
Fun!

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.007
Posy.

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.344
Posy she is.

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:40.262
The most beautiful
girl in the world.

01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:47.562
You want your daddy.
Yes, I know.

01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:51.858
Yeah.

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:56.320
<i>No one can ever prepare you for</i>

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:58.532
<i>what happens when
you have a child.</i>

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:00.366
<i>When you see
the baby in your arms</i>

01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:02.994
<i>and you know that
it's your job now.</i>

01:17:03.912 --> 01:17:07.749
<i>No one can prepare you for
the love and the fear.</i>

01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:11.336
Oh, she's lovely.

01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:14.381
You were such an ugly baby.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.383
More chimpanzee than child.

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:18.634
I remember
the first time I saw you,

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:21.555
I thanked God we were in driving
distance of London Zoo.

01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:24.348
Come on, hand over
the little bugger,

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:25.933
let's see if she bounces.

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:27.727
Are we sure... KIT KAT: Yeah,
she definitely will bounce.

01:17:27.894 --> 01:17:29.020
Oh, look.

01:17:29.146 --> 01:17:30.272
She can do anything.

01:17:30.397 --> 01:17:32.357
Look.
Hello.

01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:36.027
Sweetheart.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.780
<i>No one can prepare you
for the love</i>

01:17:38.905 --> 01:17:40.699
<i>people you love
can feel for them.</i>

01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:44.410
<i>And nothing can prepare you for</i>

01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:46.453
<i>the indifference of friends
who don't have babies.</i>

01:17:46.454 --> 01:17:48.248
Do you wanna
go to Uncle Jay, huh?

01:17:48.415 --> 01:17:50.250
No, thanks, it's fine.
It's great.

01:17:50.584 --> 01:17:52.877
<i>And it's a shock how
quickly you have to move</i>

01:17:52.878 --> 01:17:55.714
<i>to a new place you
completely can't afford.</i>

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:57.757
Look what we found.

01:17:57.883 --> 01:17:59.301
Look who it is!

01:17:59.885 --> 01:18:00.969
Honey!

01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:02.220
Sorry.

01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:08.602
<i>Suddenly, time travel seems
almost unnecessary,</i>

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:10.770
<i>because every detail of
life is so delightful.</i>

01:18:18.278 --> 01:18:19.820
What's his name?

01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:20.947
Horace, I think.

01:18:21.114 --> 01:18:22.323
Of course it is.

01:18:22.324 --> 01:18:24.617
Only one important thing
for a godfather, I'm told,

01:18:24.618 --> 01:18:26.953
never bring a present
smaller than the child.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.456
Oh, shut up, you smug bastard.

01:18:29.581 --> 01:18:31.458
Don't worry, I didn't
bring anything at all.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:33.501
She'll never know.
Hasn't got a brain yet.

01:18:33.627 --> 01:18:35.629
I didn't expect to
see you here, Harry.

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:37.797
Children's party's
not exactly your style.

01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:41.134
No, Mary, I was tricked. I was
told there would be free booze.

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:42.719
Oh!

01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.138
I hate kids, as you know.

01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:46.932
Where's Kit Kat, by the way?

01:18:47.265 --> 01:18:50.351
I don't know, she said
she'd be here around 3:00.

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:53.771
And you know we got purple
cupcakes for her especially.

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.482
Here she is!

01:18:55.649 --> 01:18:57.089
Speak of the devil,
that will be her.

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:01.321
We'll wait till
Aunty Kit Kat gets here.

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:03.823
Hey.
Jimmy.

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:05.492
Where's my sister?

01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:07.827
Thought she was here.

01:19:07.953 --> 01:19:08.995
No, she hasn't arrived.

01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:12.415
That's not good.

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.584
What does that mean?

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.001
Um...

01:19:16.002 --> 01:19:18.213
We had
an argument this morning.

01:19:18.338 --> 01:19:20.590
Over nothing, but
she'd been drinking, so...

01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:25.053
And then she ran out to get
the car to come here and

01:19:25.178 --> 01:19:27.555
I told her to
meet me here so...

01:19:27.931 --> 01:19:31.351
<i>There's a song by Baz
Luhrmann called Sunscreen.</i>

01:19:31.518 --> 01:19:33.769
<i>He says worrying
about the future</i>

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.187
<i>is as effective
as trying to solve</i>

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:38.024
<i>an algebra equation
by chewing bubble gum.</i>

01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:40.777
<i>The real troubles in your life</i>

01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:44.698
<i>will always be things that never
crossed your worried mind.</i>

01:19:58.253 --> 01:19:59.421
What happened?

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:02.882
We had a fight.

01:20:03.383 --> 01:20:04.384
And,

01:20:05.719 --> 01:20:08.221
maybe I wasn't
completely sober.

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:11.933
How is she?
Not good.

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.394
When did she leave you?
From where?

01:20:14.561 --> 01:20:16.771
I want it exact.
Exact time. Exact address.

01:20:26.573 --> 01:20:29.117
Here we are.
Sorry, sorry.

01:20:29.409 --> 01:20:30.660
Come on.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:33.246
Ah, God.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.582
Hi.
There she is.

01:20:35.915 --> 01:20:37.917
Does a small baby live here?

01:20:38.084 --> 01:20:42.255
Yes, and she's so excited.
She's downstairs.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.924
Happy birthday, Posy,

01:20:47.135 --> 01:20:49.679
I'm sorry.
I had to pick up Kit Kat.

01:20:49.804 --> 01:20:51.598
I thought she was
gonna drive herself.

01:20:51.723 --> 01:20:53.516
Turns out she couldn't.

01:20:54.768 --> 01:20:56.895
She okay?
Later.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:01.191
I'm worried about Kit Kat.

01:21:03.193 --> 01:21:05.195
Yeah. I know.

01:21:05.862 --> 01:21:08.865
She was drinking wine
while we were drinking tea.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:11.910
And Jimmy wasn't nice to her.

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:15.121
And she spurned
the purple cupcakes.

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:18.249
We have to do
something to fix it.

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:21.419
Yeah.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:24.089
But, you know,

01:21:24.798 --> 01:21:29.052
if it's gonna be fixed, I think she
probably has to do it herself.

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:31.471
Maybe.

01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:34.015
Maybe not.

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:40.230
My darling.
What's happened?

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.899
You're the best
person in the world.

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:45.318
You're top equal with
my wife. I don't get it.

01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:48.988
Maybe, just maybe,

01:21:50.115 --> 01:21:51.866
I'm the faller.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:56.496
Every family has,
like, someone who falls,

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:59.791
who doesn't make the grade,
who stumbles,

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:01.918
who life trips up.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.546
Maybe I'm our faller.

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:06.673
No.

01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:08.883
No.

01:22:15.974 --> 01:22:18.977
Okay. I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:21.354
And you have to
promise to keep it.

01:22:21.646 --> 01:22:23.022
We've always kept secrets.

01:22:23.148 --> 01:22:24.524
We have?

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:27.610
You promise you
won't ever, ever, ever,

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:30.029
ever, ever, ever, ever,

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:33.324
ever, ever, ever, ever tell?

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:34.617
Yes.

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:42.750
I can travel in time.

01:22:45.837 --> 01:22:48.131
Why are we standing in the
cupboard under the stairs?

01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:49.883
Because we're
gonna go back in time

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.800
and you're gonna do
some things differently.

01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:53.678
I love it when you're funny.

01:22:53.803 --> 01:22:56.055
Grab my hand.
Close your eyes.

01:23:13.072 --> 01:23:16.493
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:23:17.202 --> 01:23:21.039
Oh, my arsing God in a box.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.085
You're kidding?

01:23:27.086 --> 01:23:28.545
I can go anywhere
in time and you bring

01:23:28.546 --> 01:23:30.798
me back to the worst
party of all time.

01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:33.009
'Fraid so. Let's go.

01:23:35.929 --> 01:23:36.971
We've got work to do.

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:38.181
What work?

01:23:38.306 --> 01:23:41.309
Making sure you do
not meet Jimmy Kincade.

01:23:41.434 --> 01:23:42.852
Quick, in here.

01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:46.356
But he's about to
fall in love with me!

01:23:46.481 --> 01:23:48.107
Not this time he isn't.

01:23:57.867 --> 01:24:01.204
Who's the pretty looking girl?
It's Jennifer, isn't it?

01:24:01.329 --> 01:24:02.497
Yeah.

01:24:02.622 --> 01:24:03.831
Wild!

01:24:03.957 --> 01:24:05.291
I like your skirt, Jennifer.

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:06.751
Thank you.

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:09.337
Right, I get it.

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:13.550
If he hadn't met me, he would have
just had sex with someone else.

01:24:13.967 --> 01:24:15.885
Nip it in the bud, eh?

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.557
Excuse me, Jimmy.

01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:23.560
Sorry.
Do I know you?

01:24:23.685 --> 01:24:25.520
Yeah, you do.

01:24:26.104 --> 01:24:28.773
Very well. Sorry.

01:24:28.898 --> 01:24:31.316
And this is what I should
have done right at the start.

01:24:37.323 --> 01:24:40.493
Happy New Year, everybody.
Happy New Year.

01:24:40.618 --> 01:24:42.537
And back to the cupboard.

01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:46.207
Amazing!

01:24:46.499 --> 01:24:47.792
What happens now?

01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:49.298
God knows.

01:24:49.299 --> 01:24:51.003
What I'm hoping is
that from this moment on

01:24:51.004 --> 01:24:54.007
you avoid the sleazy bad guys
because they're sleazy and bad.

01:24:54.382 --> 01:24:56.759
When did you get so serious?

01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:59.220
Since it occurred to me
that I might lose you.

01:25:01.973 --> 01:25:04.684
Brace yourself,
this could be weird.

01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:07.186
Things will have changed.

01:25:13.568 --> 01:25:14.902
Oh, my God.

01:25:15.028 --> 01:25:16.029
What?

01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:17.238
Jay.

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.157
Jay Jay?
Yes.

01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:23.202
And he's adorable.
Oh, my God.

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:25.788
Right,

01:25:26.414 --> 01:25:27.915
let's do this.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.381
Come on, you two.

01:25:36.049 --> 01:25:39.093
Mum's just cracked open
a packet of biscuits.

01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:47.100
I've got
something in mind for you.

01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:48.422
I know what you're gonna say.

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:49.961
Have a biscuit and
come and help me.

01:25:51.439 --> 01:25:53.775
But leave the rest for Uncle D.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:58.529
It's just tidying really.

01:25:58.905 --> 01:26:00.907
You all right? I missed you.
Yeah.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.824
Your mum wants me
to do some gardening.

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:04.077
Okay.

01:26:06.287 --> 01:26:09.247
It's tidying up, it's
all a bit out of control.

01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:11.084
Anything that looks dead, out.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:14.087
This is what we're looking for.
Okay? All this.

01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:15.588
Dead stuff.
See this.

01:26:18.299 --> 01:26:20.718
They've torn them
to shreds, haven't they?

01:26:33.648 --> 01:26:35.441
How did everything go?

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:37.318
Immensely satisfactory.

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:41.321
I'm so happy. Oh! I wanna
hear all about it.

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:43.407
Will you do dinner
for us because there's

01:26:43.408 --> 01:26:45.284
something I have to do before
6:00 or I'll get fired?

01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:48.746
Yeah. I can't think of
anything I'd love to do more.

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:51.958
Okay, where is the most
fabulous person in the world?

01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:56.963
Come to your dad and get mashed
up food shoved into your mouth!

01:27:04.095 --> 01:27:05.555
Hello there, little boy.

01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:10.935
You just

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.479
wait there and I'll
be back in a minute.

01:27:25.825 --> 01:27:27.826
Dad, can I have a quick word?

01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:29.662
Yeah. Sure.

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:33.499
I can't go back past
the birth again, can I?

01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:35.500
No. I should have
mentioned that.

01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:38.045
You're okay till it
comes out but the exact

01:27:38.171 --> 01:27:40.673
sperm at the exact
moment got you this

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.174
particular baby,

01:27:42.175 --> 01:27:43.926
so if you do anything
the tiniest bit

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.803
different, you'll
have a different child.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:52.602
So, every day up 'til yesterday
is as it will always be? Lost?

01:27:53.519 --> 01:27:55.813
Just like for everyone else.

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.857
Okay. Interesting.

01:27:58.649 --> 01:28:01.319
Tough. I love you, Dad.
I've gotta go.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:27.719
- Go home.
- No.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.387
We're not leaving
this room until we find

01:28:29.388 --> 01:28:33.184
a way of making sure
this never happens again.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.740
Will you go now?

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:03.422
I have to leave Jimmy, don't I?

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:05.925
For good.

01:29:06.884 --> 01:29:08.094
And

01:29:08.261 --> 01:29:10.263
I have to stop drinking.

01:29:13.182 --> 01:29:15.101
And stop leaving jobs.

01:29:17.103 --> 01:29:21.190
And I have to
go out with someone

01:29:21.941 --> 01:29:24.610
nice and boring.

01:29:27.613 --> 01:29:28.781
Yay.

01:29:32.118 --> 01:29:35.246
And, you know, nice
isn't necessarily boring.

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:36.622
Like who?

01:29:37.748 --> 01:29:39.250
Matt Damon?

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:40.960
Okay.

01:29:41.961 --> 01:29:43.628
I'll go out with Matt Damon.

01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:46.965
Tell me,
have you seen Jay recently?

01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:51.470
Your Jay? What, sticky-up hair Jay?
Looks a bit like a muppet Jay?

01:29:51.596 --> 01:29:52.597
Yes.

01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:56.392
He just popped into my head.
He's always had a crush on you.

01:29:56.767 --> 01:29:58.769
Really?
Yeah.

01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:01.606
Weird!

01:30:01.731 --> 01:30:04.108
Thinking of asking him to dinner.
Are you free?

01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:07.987
Might be. Might have to
freshen up a bit first.

01:30:08.112 --> 01:30:10.364
Yeah. You look shit.

01:30:17.038 --> 01:30:18.414
Joanna.

01:30:18.539 --> 01:30:19.957
Oh, thank Christ you're back.

01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:21.667
It's been a total nightmare.

01:30:21.834 --> 01:30:23.461
I know. It's
all fine anyway.

01:30:23.586 --> 01:30:25.087
Where is she?

01:30:25.212 --> 01:30:26.813
It was the single
worst night of my life.

01:30:27.006 --> 01:30:28.507
Where's Posy?

01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:31.677
There she is! Hello!

01:30:31.802 --> 01:30:34.513
Hello! Hello.

01:30:34.639 --> 01:30:36.849
Darling, how are you doing?

01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:42.355
Let's have another one.

01:30:44.148 --> 01:30:47.193
Oh, screw that. No.

01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:52.073
That hurt and I got fat.
Like fat-fat.

01:30:52.198 --> 01:30:54.492
Got a little
bit fat, didn't she.

01:30:54.825 --> 01:30:56.786
Tell Mummy you want a sister.

01:30:56.911 --> 01:31:00.998
No. Tell Daddy you're happy
being an only child.

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:05.127
<i>Fortunately we are
young and careless and</i>

01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:07.672
<i>it wasn't long before
there were four of us.</i>

01:31:07.797 --> 01:31:11.175
And this is incredible. Posy
Lake, only 3 years old,

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:14.261
is about to break the women's
10 metre Olympic record.

01:31:14.387 --> 01:31:18.516
They're gonna do it. And here they
are, they've done it! Fantastic.

01:31:18.641 --> 01:31:21.352
That was brilliant.
You're so good.

01:31:21.477 --> 01:31:22.895
Sleeping right
through all that.

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.355
Can you help me?
I'm so nervous.

01:31:25.356 --> 01:31:27.692
What do I wear for dinner
with our bestselling author?

01:31:27.817 --> 01:31:30.361
Let me finish up with the
monsters and I'll come right up.

01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:31.696
Great. Thank you.

01:31:32.029 --> 01:31:33.447
Go again.

01:31:33.864 --> 01:31:36.492
Okay. How about this?

01:31:36.617 --> 01:31:39.120
That's gorgeous.
Job done. Yeah.

01:31:39.245 --> 01:31:42.415
No. Take it
seriously. It's...

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:46.043
I don't know.
No, I hate it.

01:31:46.377 --> 01:31:48.087
Yeah.
It's boring and

01:31:48.587 --> 01:31:51.465
makes me look kind of lumpy.

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:54.385
No, you're right. It is boring and lumpy.
I hate it.

01:31:56.262 --> 01:31:58.139
Okay. What about this?

01:31:58.514 --> 01:32:00.474
Gorgeous. We did it.

01:32:00.599 --> 01:32:03.185
No, it's too breasty.

01:32:03.352 --> 01:32:05.396
Is it?
Okay.

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:06.604
It's not too breasty.

01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:09.816
No. I'm not wearing these heels.
I look like a prostitute.

01:32:09.817 --> 01:32:11.444
Not high heels, then.

01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:13.154
But then we have
the short legs problem.

01:32:13.279 --> 01:32:15.781
Well, do you want to look
like a prostitute or a dwarf?

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:19.035
Warning. That's a warning.

01:32:22.705 --> 01:32:23.748
Yes!

01:32:23.873 --> 01:32:24.874
No.

01:32:28.794 --> 01:32:29.795
No!

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:32.923
Now that I like.

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.676
No, I'm just
picking up the dress

01:32:35.801 --> 01:32:38.304
that this goes under.
Such a bad boy.

01:32:40.723 --> 01:32:41.807
This one?

01:32:41.974 --> 01:32:43.017
Not bad.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:44.977
Or this one?

01:32:45.102 --> 01:32:46.479
It's a trick question,
isn't it? Same dress.

01:32:46.604 --> 01:32:47.605
No!

01:32:48.147 --> 01:32:49.190
No?

01:32:49.607 --> 01:32:51.776
Okay. I don't think
this one's too bad.

01:32:52.193 --> 01:32:53.861
Yeah, it's fabulous.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.946
Really?
Yeah.

01:32:56.072 --> 01:32:58.490
Okay. Great. Good.

01:32:58.491 --> 01:32:59.617
Um...

01:33:00.076 --> 01:33:01.786
How about the blue one?

01:33:01.911 --> 01:33:03.579
The blue one?
Yeah.

01:33:03.704 --> 01:33:06.956
The first one that you tried
on that was boring and lumpy,

01:33:06.957 --> 01:33:09.209
but that wasn't actually
boring and lumpy, that one?

01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:11.128
Yeah, which do you prefer?

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:13.172
I don't know. I'm actually
starting to go mad.

01:33:13.297 --> 01:33:14.673
I think I like the blue one.

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.217
Okay.
Yeah.

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:20.262
Okay. Okay, let's go
with this one, then?

01:33:20.387 --> 01:33:22.223
You look amazing.

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:23.516
Really?
Yes.

01:33:23.641 --> 01:33:25.226
Okay, thanks.

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:27.436
Oh, God.

01:33:27.895 --> 01:33:29.647
Where's Posy?

01:33:29.939 --> 01:33:31.774
I left her downstairs.

01:33:32.233 --> 01:33:35.569
Not leaving the door open to the
room with the manuscript in it?

01:33:36.612 --> 01:33:38.280
I don't think so.

01:33:39.115 --> 01:33:41.534
Look at me. Look me in
the eye TIM: Mmm-hmm.

01:33:41.659 --> 01:33:45.079
And talk me through this.
Basically my life is over.

01:33:45.204 --> 01:33:47.790
I really need to go out for just
like two minutes, maybe one.

01:33:47.915 --> 01:33:49.583
Don't you dare!

01:33:50.668 --> 01:33:53.838
Don't you dare answer that!
What am I gonna do?

01:33:53.974 --> 01:33:55.839
I think that we should
really answer the phone.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.299
If you answer
the goddamn phone,

01:33:57.424 --> 01:33:58.967
I will kill you with the phone.

01:33:58.968 --> 01:34:02.096
I won't answer the phone,
but I do need to get out.

01:34:02.221 --> 01:34:04.223
No, no getting out,
no getting out. No.

01:34:04.348 --> 01:34:05.850
Okay, right.

01:34:05.975 --> 01:34:07.560
Oh! Sorry, Mr McEwan.

01:34:07.685 --> 01:34:11.605
We read most of your book but,
you see, the rest of it was

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:14.358
coloured on or shredded.

01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:16.694
Yeah.

01:34:17.736 --> 01:34:19.780
I had no idea Posy
actually knew how to use

01:34:19.905 --> 01:34:22.073
that machine.
In a way that's impressive.

01:34:23.534 --> 01:34:26.203
What is it?
How can I help you?

01:34:28.914 --> 01:34:30.583
Oh, Mary. Uh...

01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.878
No, everything... Sorry.

01:34:34.753 --> 01:34:36.714
Your son will explain.

01:34:36.839 --> 01:34:38.340
It's your mother.

01:34:39.008 --> 01:34:40.342
Hi, Mum.

01:34:45.848 --> 01:34:47.850
No, no, it's okay.
We'll...

01:34:48.058 --> 01:34:49.810
We'll come straight down.

01:34:50.686 --> 01:34:52.021
Okay, bye.

01:35:06.619 --> 01:35:07.953
Hello, darling.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.455
Mum. How are you?

01:35:10.539 --> 01:35:11.624
Honestly?

01:35:11.749 --> 01:35:12.791
Why not?

01:35:13.209 --> 01:35:15.878
I am fucking furious.

01:35:16.503 --> 01:35:21.175
I am so uninterested in
a life without your father.

01:35:22.384 --> 01:35:24.637
Mary. Come on,
let's make some tea.

01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:26.639
How are you?

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:27.890
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:35:28.015 --> 01:35:29.141
Did you eat?

01:35:29.266 --> 01:35:30.392
Yes, of course.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.483
Desmond.

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:39.817
How are you?

01:35:39.818 --> 01:35:41.570
I'm very well, thanks.

01:35:41.987 --> 01:35:43.656
Though a little hot.

01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:45.282
Hmm.

01:35:47.826 --> 01:35:50.496
Your father,
I think, is not so well.

01:35:51.497 --> 01:35:52.581
Cancer.

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:54.833
Yes.

01:35:55.292 --> 01:35:57.795
I'm very unhappy about it, Tim.

01:35:59.797 --> 01:36:01.799
At your wedding
he said he loved me.

01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:04.301
He does.
I know.

01:36:06.262 --> 01:36:08.597
That was
the best day of my life.

01:36:11.183 --> 01:36:13.519
So this is probably the worst.

01:36:19.775 --> 01:36:20.776
Dad.

01:36:23.028 --> 01:36:24.947
Oh, for God's sake.

01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:27.324
Not you, too.

01:36:27.449 --> 01:36:28.574
What?

01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:32.453
Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up blubbing
her eyes out and now you're here.

01:36:32.454 --> 01:36:33.914
What's Mum been saying?

01:36:34.123 --> 01:36:35.165
The truth.

01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:36.333
Yeah, well,

01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:39.169
apart from that?

01:36:40.087 --> 01:36:42.798
It may have been the
smoking but I couldn't

01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:45.676
undo that as it was
before you were all born.

01:36:46.302 --> 01:36:48.886
And anyway, your mother definitely
wouldn't have gone out with me

01:36:48.887 --> 01:36:51.222
if I hadn't been
such a sexy smoker.

01:36:54.435 --> 01:36:58.564
I did get diagnosed as soon as
possible, but it was too late.

01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:01.734
How long have we got?

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.152
You know,

01:37:03.277 --> 01:37:05.487
it, it could be

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:07.072
years.

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:11.617
How long really?

01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:15.873
Weeks, I'm afraid.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.883
Have we had this
conversation before?

01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:29.762
Yeah.

01:37:31.513 --> 01:37:33.223
What happened?

01:37:33.349 --> 01:37:35.893
I rather let myself down.

01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:37.978
I hugged you.

01:37:57.289 --> 01:37:58.289
Sorry.

01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:01.043
I think I just thought
with the time thing...

01:38:01.668 --> 01:38:03.796
No, I never said
we could fix things.

01:38:03.962 --> 01:38:06.048
I specifically never said that.

01:38:06.173 --> 01:38:08.675
Life's a mixed bag,
no matter who you are.

01:38:08.801 --> 01:38:10.719
Look at Jesus.
He was the Son of God,

01:38:10.844 --> 01:38:12.805
for God's sake, and look
how that turned out.

01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:14.181
I know, but

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.601
you must see
I feel a bit cheated.

01:38:17.726 --> 01:38:20.145
Don't. In fact,
feel the opposite.

01:38:20.312 --> 01:38:22.773
The only people who
give up work at 50

01:38:22.898 --> 01:38:25.150
are the time travellers
with cancer who want

01:38:25.317 --> 01:38:27.569
to play more table tennis
with their sons.

01:38:29.696 --> 01:38:30.697
Right.

01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:34.493
So that's been the deal?

01:38:36.829 --> 01:38:40.499
I'm sorry we had to call.
It's suddenly got very bad.

01:38:46.296 --> 01:38:51.343
And I have something very important
to tell you. Or, let me check,

01:38:51.677 --> 01:38:54.387
do you want to
know the big secret,

01:38:54.388 --> 01:38:56.682
or would you rather find it
out for yourself like I did?

01:38:56.807 --> 01:38:58.851
Oh, Christ,
there's another secret?

01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:02.855
Less dramatic.
Much more important.

01:39:03.605 --> 01:39:06.275
The real mothership.

01:39:08.861 --> 01:39:11.363
No, go on. Tell me.

01:39:11.697 --> 01:39:13.657
Let's save some time.

01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:22.541
<i>And so he told me his
secret formula for happiness.</i>

01:39:24.543 --> 01:39:26.628
<i>Part one of the two part plan</i>

01:39:26.753 --> 01:39:28.880
<i>was that I should just get on
with ordinary life,</i>

01:39:28.881 --> 01:39:31.884
<i>living it day by day,
like anyone else.</i>

01:39:37.389 --> 01:39:42.227
This is our current statement with a
revised paragraph there, highlighted.

01:39:45.564 --> 01:39:47.900
Rupert. Rupert, is that
the best you can do?

01:39:49.026 --> 01:39:52.237
No. Absolutely not.
We can change that.

01:39:52.362 --> 01:39:53.864
Item number two.

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:04.082
Good afternoon, sir. Are you
eating in or taking away today?

01:40:04.249 --> 01:40:05.584
Take away, please.

01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:07.044
Yeah? No problem.

01:40:07.169 --> 01:40:11.173
Lovely, that's 4.24 then, please, sir.
Thank you kindly.

01:40:11.673 --> 01:40:14.259
Lovely. And there's your change, sir.
76 pence change.

01:40:14.384 --> 01:40:16.094
Thanks.
Thank you. Hello there.

01:40:16.512 --> 01:40:17.792
Are you eating in
or taking away?

01:40:23.352 --> 01:40:27.146
Do you find the Defendant, John
Welbeck, guilty or not guilty of fraud?

01:40:27.147 --> 01:40:28.272
Not guilty.

01:40:28.273 --> 01:40:29.441
And that is
the verdict of you all?

01:40:29.608 --> 01:40:30.776
Yes.

01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:32.068
Thank you.
You may be seated.

01:40:32.069 --> 01:40:33.111
Thank God.

01:40:33.237 --> 01:40:35.614
Let the Defendant
be discharged.

01:40:36.281 --> 01:40:38.283
Be upstanding in court.

01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:53.465
Lights out?
Yeah.

01:40:54.299 --> 01:40:55.634
Tough day.

01:40:56.969 --> 01:40:59.471
<i>But then came
part two of Dad's plan.</i>

01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:05.644
<i>He told me to live every day
again almost exactly the same.</i>

01:41:06.436 --> 01:41:08.980
<i>The first time with all the
tensions and worries that</i>

01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:11.775
<i>stop us noticing how
sweet the world can be,</i>

01:41:12.067 --> 01:41:14.653
<i>but the second time noticing.</i>

01:41:14.778 --> 01:41:16.280
Okay, Dad.

01:41:16.989 --> 01:41:18.490
Let's give it a go.

01:41:23.912 --> 01:41:25.872
What's our statement
at the moment?

01:41:26.206 --> 01:41:28.875
This is it with the revised...

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:38.677
Robert, this does not pass.
Is this the best you can do?

01:41:40.512 --> 01:41:42.222
I'll leave you two
to thrash this out.

01:41:45.017 --> 01:41:46.268
Ooh.

01:41:48.854 --> 01:41:50.856
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.

01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:52.190
Are you eating in
or taking away today?

01:41:52.316 --> 01:41:53.566
Take away, please.

01:41:53.567 --> 01:41:54.776
Would you like a bag?

01:41:54.901 --> 01:41:56.235
That's fine.

01:41:56.236 --> 01:41:57.528
Lovely.
That's 6.23 then, please.

01:41:57.529 --> 01:41:58.863
And enjoy the rest of your day.

01:41:58.864 --> 01:42:00.198
Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:42:01.074 --> 01:42:02.075
Hello, there.

01:42:05.746 --> 01:42:07.539
Look around you!
What?

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:08.874
Isn't this room beautiful?

01:42:08.999 --> 01:42:10.167
Yeah.

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:12.044
Come on.

01:42:12.878 --> 01:42:14.171
Not guilty.

01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:19.384
Fantastic!

01:42:52.542 --> 01:42:54.627
So not such
a bad day after all?

01:42:54.628 --> 01:42:57.714
No. It was
pretty good really.

01:42:58.757 --> 01:43:01.426
Very good day, actually,
as it turns out.

01:43:02.302 --> 01:43:04.763
Well, that's a relief,

01:43:05.764 --> 01:43:08.767
because if it had
been a very bad day,

01:43:09.226 --> 01:43:13.230
I thought I might have had to have
had sex with you to make up for it.

01:43:14.773 --> 01:43:15.774
Goodnight.

01:43:19.027 --> 01:43:20.153
Mmm.

01:43:20.779 --> 01:43:23.156
It was a very, very bad day.

01:43:23.281 --> 01:43:25.659
It went very, very badly.

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:28.453
I got fired from my job.

01:43:29.287 --> 01:43:31.456
And then I killed a man.

01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:39.297
That is a very bad day.

01:43:39.464 --> 01:43:41.466
It's terrible.
Yeah.

01:43:42.426 --> 01:43:44.761
Like the worst day ever.

01:43:45.303 --> 01:43:46.972
So sorry.

01:43:51.893 --> 01:43:55.480
<i>Some days, of course, though,
you only want to go through once.</i>

01:43:56.314 --> 01:43:57.482
You okay?

01:44:48.992 --> 01:44:51.870
Right, are we ready for this?

01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:55.707
'Course we're not.
Hateful day.

01:44:56.541 --> 01:44:59.377
Just give me one minute.

01:45:21.733 --> 01:45:23.735
This is so brilliant.

01:45:24.653 --> 01:45:29.324
Dickens is so good on
actual jokes, actual gags.

01:45:30.242 --> 01:45:31.993
Where have you come from?

01:45:32.369 --> 01:45:33.912
It's the...

01:45:34.246 --> 01:45:35.914
Oh. Okay.

01:45:36.206 --> 01:45:37.749
Big day.

01:45:38.583 --> 01:45:42.045
Thanks for dropping in.
How's Uncle Desmond's suit?

01:45:42.170 --> 01:45:44.005
Oh, immaculate.

01:45:44.256 --> 01:45:45.257
Excellent.

01:45:45.924 --> 01:45:47.675
Did I mention I wanted
the Nick Cave track?

01:45:47.676 --> 01:45:49.426
It's taken care of.

01:45:49.427 --> 01:45:50.887
Thank you.

01:45:51.263 --> 01:45:53.598
Can I just read
you this one bit?

01:45:57.936 --> 01:46:00.438
Read away,
I've got lots of time.

01:46:01.106 --> 01:46:03.065
"I think the Romans
must have aggravated

01:46:03.066 --> 01:46:05.777
one another very
much with their noses."

01:46:05.944 --> 01:46:09.447
"Perhaps they became the restless
people they were in consequence."

01:46:09.573 --> 01:46:12.784
"Anyhow, Mr Wopsle's Roman
nose so aggravated me..."

01:47:48.672 --> 01:47:51.007
What do you
think about the kids?

01:47:51.132 --> 01:47:52.634
What about them?

01:47:53.677 --> 01:47:55.887
Not many of them, are there?

01:47:56.972 --> 01:47:57.973
What?

01:47:58.682 --> 01:48:00.684
Well, I mean two?

01:48:03.478 --> 01:48:05.938
It's more than
the Chinese are allowed.

01:48:07.816 --> 01:48:10.485
I just thought
that maybe, you know,

01:48:11.569 --> 01:48:13.404
it was time for
the insurance baby.

01:48:13.405 --> 01:48:14.488
What?

01:48:14.489 --> 01:48:15.990
In case one of them
is really smart,

01:48:15.991 --> 01:48:18.325
we don't want the other one to
feel stupid their whole life.

01:48:18.326 --> 01:48:22.706
And if we had a third one, then
we could have two happy dummies.

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.168
What do you think?

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:28.712
Huh?

01:48:31.506 --> 01:48:34.009
<i>It was the toughest
decision of my life.</i>

01:48:34.509 --> 01:48:36.928
<i>Saying 'yes' to
the future meant</i>

01:48:37.053 --> 01:48:39.431
<i>saying 'goodbye'
to my dad. Forever.</i>

01:48:41.224 --> 01:48:43.226
Why don't we wait a bit?

01:48:46.104 --> 01:48:47.272
Absolutely.

01:48:48.106 --> 01:48:50.108
You're right. Yeah.

01:48:54.738 --> 01:48:57.532
How about now?

01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:00.785
Or now?

01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:04.289
Now?

01:49:11.713 --> 01:49:12.714
Yeah,

01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:15.091
okay.

01:49:16.593 --> 01:49:17.635
Really?

01:49:19.929 --> 01:49:22.599
Dad always wished
there had been more of us.

01:49:23.391 --> 01:49:24.392
So...

01:49:26.811 --> 01:49:29.481
Anyway, we might try
and nothing happens.

01:49:30.065 --> 01:49:31.066
Exactly.

01:49:39.824 --> 01:49:41.909
Really could be tonight.

01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:44.495
Mmm. And you cannot believe
the detail in which

01:49:44.496 --> 01:49:46.497
I know the route
to the hospital.

01:49:46.498 --> 01:49:47.832
Oh, yay.

01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:53.004
Will you excuse me for a sec?

01:49:53.922 --> 01:49:55.672
Just have to go downstairs.

01:49:55.673 --> 01:49:56.841
Mmm.

01:50:12.273 --> 01:50:15.359
...and it's 17-20 in
this incredibly tight contest

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.153
being played by
the two most physically

01:50:17.278 --> 01:50:19.030
perfect players in
the history of the game.

01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:22.116
The crowd, enchanted by the
younger player, are seduced

01:50:22.117 --> 01:50:24.869
by memories of the older
player's illustrious past.

01:50:25.245 --> 01:50:26.496
Ahh!

01:50:26.871 --> 01:50:28.873
Oh, my God, I've won.

01:50:29.707 --> 01:50:32.043
I haven't won in years.

01:50:32.544 --> 01:50:34.504
You finally got good.

01:50:35.213 --> 01:50:38.842
What's my prize? Apart from the
Olympic gold medal, of course.

01:50:39.884 --> 01:50:41.094
A kiss will have to do.

01:50:41.219 --> 01:50:42.470
A kiss?

01:50:42.887 --> 01:50:44.222
A kiss?

01:50:47.058 --> 01:50:48.143
Oh.

01:50:49.561 --> 01:50:51.521
Ah, I get you.

01:50:52.897 --> 01:50:54.399
This is it, then?

01:50:56.359 --> 01:50:57.735
This is it.

01:50:58.528 --> 01:51:00.738
It's my last bit of extra time.

01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:03.740
The baby is
completely on the way.

01:51:03.741 --> 01:51:04.909
Oh!

01:51:24.762 --> 01:51:26.097
Congratulations.

01:51:33.104 --> 01:51:34.606
My son.

01:51:37.942 --> 01:51:39.569
My dad.

01:51:44.532 --> 01:51:46.576
Is there anything
at all I can do?

01:51:46.701 --> 01:51:48.786
Is there anything
you want to do?

01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.249
I don't know.
There is this

01:51:55.043 --> 01:51:56.711
one thing.

01:51:57.045 --> 01:51:59.130
A quick little walk.

01:51:59.255 --> 01:52:01.132
Totally against the rules,
of course,

01:52:01.257 --> 01:52:03.134
but if we don't change a thing,

01:52:03.468 --> 01:52:06.804
if we're very careful,
it shouldn't do any harm.

01:52:07.305 --> 01:52:08.932
It would be nice.

01:52:39.337 --> 01:52:42.340
I'm really trying.
I'm really trying.

01:52:44.175 --> 01:52:45.468
Get down low.

01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:51.182
Total defeat.

01:53:00.942 --> 01:53:02.277
I'm tired.

01:53:03.278 --> 01:53:04.696
Thanks, Dad.

01:53:20.211 --> 01:53:23.047
<i>So I'm almost
up-to-date with my story.</i>

01:53:23.548 --> 01:53:27.051
<i>As all families do, we got
used to life after death.</i>

01:53:27.176 --> 01:53:29.053
<i>And it was still fine.</i>

01:53:29.846 --> 01:53:34.017
<i>And things settled back into their
traditional rhythms season after season,</i>

01:53:34.475 --> 01:53:36.894
<i>and are much as
they have always been.</i>

01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:40.898
<i>And we've got used to
Kit Kat being happy again.</i>

01:53:41.858 --> 01:53:44.360
<i>And then we got used
to her being a mum.</i>

01:53:44.736 --> 01:53:47.405
<i>Albeit not a very
good or even safe one.</i>

01:53:48.823 --> 01:53:50.199
<i>And in the end,</i>

01:53:50.325 --> 01:53:53.995
<i>I think I've learned the final
lesson from my travels in time.</i>

01:53:54.787 --> 01:53:57.914
<i>And I've even gone one step
further than my father did.</i>

01:54:08.801 --> 01:54:10.552
Okay, I'll do the kids.

01:54:12.305 --> 01:54:14.891
No, don't worry.
I'll do them.

01:54:15.016 --> 01:54:16.767
Yeah, you do them,
you lazy bum.

01:54:17.852 --> 01:54:21.856
<i>The truth is, I now don't travel
back at all. Not even for the day.</i>

01:54:22.273 --> 01:54:24.859
<i>I just try to
live every day as if</i>

01:54:24.984 --> 01:54:27.612
<i>I've deliberately
come back to this one day</i>

01:54:27.987 --> 01:54:31.657
<i>to enjoy it as if it
was the full final day</i>

01:54:31.908 --> 01:54:34.660
<i>of my extraordinary,
ordinary life.</i>

01:55:02.939 --> 01:55:06.651
Hello, you're down already. That's great.
Thank you so much for that.

01:55:06.776 --> 01:55:08.152
And in we go.

01:55:09.779 --> 01:55:12.573
Posy? Posy!

01:55:20.957 --> 01:55:21.958
That's fine.

01:55:43.438 --> 01:55:46.274
<i>We're all travelling
through time together</i>

01:55:46.566 --> 01:55:48.734
<i>every day of our lives.</i>

01:55:48.901 --> 01:55:51.404
<i>All we can do is do our best</i>

01:55:51.863 --> 01:55:54.615
<i>to relish this remarkable ride.</i>

01:56:37.575 --> 01:56:39.494
Yes, yes, yes...

01:56:51.797 --> 01:56:53.883
Okay, I'll see you then.

01:56:54.008 --> 01:56:55.426
Bye-bye.

01:56:56.093 --> 01:56:57.595
See you later.
