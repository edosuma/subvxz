24:39.170 --> 24:42.090

24:42.100 --> 24:43.190
-Good reason we're all a little bit wary

24:43.200 --> 24:45.020
of our current accommodations.

24:45.030 --> 24:46.050
We need to think ahead, son.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.230
-No, we need to find a first aid kit.

25:34.220 --> 25:36.130
Won't be persuaded otherwise.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.090
That's that.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.130

25:44.120 --> 25:46.010
back when you were all kids,

25:59.140 --> 26:00.180

26:00.190 --> 26:02.230

26:03.000 --> 26:04.190

26:05.050 --> 26:06.210
Always together, Charlie.

26:07.220 --> 26:10.090
You know, I remember how you looked at Albert growing up.

26:16.010 --> 26:18.220
Always ahead of the game, never wanted to be outplayed.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.150
And I guess in all the excitement

26:21.160 --> 26:24.070
you didn't notice how he...

26:24.080 --> 26:27.200
how he looked at you, Charlie, but I did.

26:27.210 --> 26:30.030
I noticed. He trusted you.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.050
And I know there were times when the world seemed

26:34.060 --> 26:36.130
a pretty unforgiving place and having someone out there

26:36.140 --> 26:38.090
who he trusted, who he knew...

26:39.200 --> 26:41.090
without a doubt

26:42.150 --> 26:44.100
would always have his back.

26:47.070 --> 26:50.020
No, I don't suppose you realized what you meant to him.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.230
But a mother does.

26:56.210 --> 26:58.190
I don't expect you to forget what's happened

26:58.200 --> 26:59.210
these last few days,

26:59.220 --> 27:03.040
but I hope you know that Albert has always needed you

27:04.110 --> 27:06.100
just as much as you've needed him.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.150
-(sighs)

27:21.140 --> 27:23.080
-You can tell how much he means to you.

27:24.190 --> 27:26.130
-He's the only family I have left.

27:27.090 --> 27:29.050
-Nothing's more important than family, right?

27:35.180 --> 27:37.090
Mine wasn't up to much,

27:38.190 --> 27:40.150
but I found my family with the Hills.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.010
They treat me like one of their own.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.140
I wouldn't let anything bad happen to 'em.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.020
-Is that a threat?

27:49.170 --> 27:51.100
-Actually, it's the opposite.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.130
It's an invitation.

27:55.010 --> 27:56.070
-I don't understand.

27:57.230 --> 27:59.120
-In all the time I've known Albert,

27:59.130 --> 28:01.010
he would do absolutely anything

28:01.020 --> 28:02.160
to protect the people he cares about.

28:02.170 --> 28:05.070
And if he's gone to such great lengths to protect you,

28:05.080 --> 28:06.190
then he must trust you.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.220
And if Albert Hill trusts you,

28:08.230 --> 28:11.010
then you'll be all right with the rest of us.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.150
-(Salazar coughing)

28:12.160 --> 28:15.100
-(speaking Spanish)

28:21.200 --> 28:24.040
-Look, whatever else is going on around here,

28:24.200 --> 28:27.010
we are holding something both Mayor Ortega and Garcia

28:27.020 --> 28:28.070
would love to get their hands on.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.110
We need to make some decisions.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.010
-And I took some precautions before we skipped San Toledo.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.020
I called Clarence.

28:35.030 --> 28:36.100
Asked him to have a sneak around town.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.130
Keep watch for police activity.

28:38.140 --> 28:39.230
-Clarence, the bar fly?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.150
-Yeah, that don't make me feel much better, Al.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.130
-Don't underestimate Clarence, boys.

28:43.140 --> 28:46.040
There's more to that sweet fella than meets the eye.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.190
-Sweet fella?

28:47.200 --> 28:51.040
48 hours ago you was about ready to extract his teeth, Vic.

28:51.050 --> 28:53.190
-I was wrong. And his teeth remain intact.

28:54.170 --> 28:56.130
-If he spots any trouble, he'll give us a call, right?

29:04.180 --> 29:07.030
-(speaking Spanish)

29:10.180 --> 29:13.220
-(line ringing)

29:14.230 --> 29:17.130
-Pick up, Lily. Come on, pick up.

29:21.140 --> 29:23.150
-(groaning)

29:32.090 --> 29:34.150
-I hear there's a bullet needs removing.

29:35.050 --> 29:37.170
I boiled the tweezers to kill any germs.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.020
Do you want me to get it out? -Ines: No.

29:39.030 --> 29:40.050
No.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.150
I can do this.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.140
-Hmm.

29:45.210 --> 29:47.230
You hold tight, my friend. This is gonna hurt.

29:48.130 --> 29:50.130
Take a deep breath, love. You've got it.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.120
-(sighs)

30:02.140 --> 30:04.100
-Shh. Shh.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.100
Shh.

30:09.150 --> 30:10.190
It's out.

30:26.110 --> 30:30.060
-Bloody hell. After all that she can thread a needle.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.070
-Excuse me?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.130
-Oh, nothing.

30:34.140 --> 30:35.190
Tidy work, love.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.130
-So what do you think, Vic?

30:47.160 --> 30:50.100
-Five minutes ago I was wracking my brain trying to figure out

30:50.110 --> 30:53.180
how my one and only son fell for an officer of the law.

30:53.190 --> 30:54.220
-And now?

30:55.100 --> 30:57.160
-Now, I know he didn't fall for a cop.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.220
He fell for her.

31:02.050 --> 31:05.010
-I... I think you might be right.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.180
-Hmm.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.120
-(footsteps approaching)

31:11.120 --> 31:12.140
-There you are.

31:12.150 --> 31:13.200
-What did I do?

31:14.140 --> 31:15.130
-It's not what you've done.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.190
It's what you can do that I'm interested in.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.230
-Go on.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.040
-Look, I think you're the only one

31:21.050 --> 31:23.060
who can help Albert and Charlie patch things up.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.080
You three have been best mates for years.

31:25.090 --> 31:26.130
No one knows them like you do.

31:26.140 --> 31:28.040
-So what am I supposed to do?

31:29.060 --> 31:30.080
-I don't know.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.070
Figure it out.

31:32.180 --> 31:34.000
Look, we've all gotta work together

31:34.010 --> 31:35.140
if we're gonna get through this, all right?

31:41.230 --> 31:42.210
-Albert.

31:46.110 --> 31:47.170
Can I have a minute, son?

31:48.130 --> 31:51.100
-Why? So you can tell me how badly I fucked all this up?

31:52.110 --> 31:54.190
-Well, I mean, things could've gone a little bit smoother,

31:54.200 --> 31:56.190
but we're all still alive, and we've got the diamonds.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.140
-What is it then?

32:01.070 --> 32:02.050
-Listen.

32:02.220 --> 32:06.130
I-I know that we didn't have a lot of chance to talk

32:06.140 --> 32:08.000
when you were growing up.

32:08.110 --> 32:11.040
After all, I was behind bars for your formative years.

32:11.050 --> 32:13.020
-I got by. -I know you did.

32:13.130 --> 32:16.030
And you did it without any of your old man's pearls of wisdom.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.150
-Dad, if you're about to give me the speech

32:17.160 --> 32:20.100
about a Hill is never to trust cop,

32:20.110 --> 32:22.030
it's a little bit late for that, don't you think?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.230
-Well, a few years ago I might've tried

32:24.000 --> 32:27.020
to convince you of that, but not today.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.160
-Why, 'cause I've already screwed that one up?

32:29.050 --> 32:31.000
-No, 'cause it would've been wrong.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.220
Hopefully it won't take you as long to learn what I have.

32:37.060 --> 32:41.180
You know, you can be the strongest,

32:42.130 --> 32:46.090
smartest, most daring robber in the world, but...

32:48.180 --> 32:50.030
listen to this.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.150
There's no score that's ever gonna be big enough

32:53.160 --> 32:55.120
to fill in what you lose along the way.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.180
-You feeling all right?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.010
-Never better.

33:07.140 --> 33:08.120
-Hmm.

33:08.130 --> 33:10.090
-And to be perfectly frank,

33:10.100 --> 33:11.190
after everything that we've been through,

33:11.200 --> 33:14.110
you bringing your badge-bearing girlfriend home

33:14.120 --> 33:16.040
for dinner is hardly the most surprising thing

33:16.050 --> 33:17.180
to happen this week.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.040
(laughing) -Al?

33:19.210 --> 33:21.070
-Yeah? -Can I have a word?

33:21.080 --> 33:22.190
-All right, what is it?

33:24.230 --> 33:26.020
So, what is it? -Stand there.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.100
-Billy, Lotti said you wanted to...

33:29.110 --> 33:30.230
-What's this all about? -Listen, just shut up

33:31.000 --> 33:32.070
and stand there, all right?

33:33.020 --> 33:34.040
-(sighs)

33:34.050 --> 33:35.200
-Al, turn around.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.060
-What? -Just do it.

33:40.220 --> 33:42.220
Okay, Charlie, back up a step.

33:44.060 --> 33:46.130
That'll do. Ass out, Albert.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.120
-Fuck off.

33:47.130 --> 33:48.230
-If the two of you are gonna keep fighting

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
like a couple of whiny kids,

33:50.010 --> 33:51.220
we'll just sort this out like we did when we were 12.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.210
Charlie's the offending party,

33:53.220 --> 33:56.030
so, by the laws the three of us sat down,

33:56.040 --> 33:58.200
Charlie gets one free kick to Albert's ass.

34:00.050 --> 34:01.090
Hard as you like. -What is this?

34:01.100 --> 34:03.150
This is ridiculous. -Hold... Hold on.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.200
He might be on to something.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.200
-Come on then. Let's get going.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.190
-All right, you know what?

34:08.200 --> 34:09.190
If that what it takes, okay,

34:09.200 --> 34:11.080
I'm prepared to face my sentence, all right?

34:12.080 --> 34:13.170
One kick, Charlie.

34:17.070 --> 34:19.020
-Oh!

34:23.140 --> 34:24.180
-(sighs)

34:26.010 --> 34:27.220
-(laughing)

34:27.230 --> 34:29.100
I can't believe this actually used to work.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.150
-Things were simpler back then.

34:31.020 --> 34:32.170
-For Christ's sake, turn around.

34:32.180 --> 34:34.140
You look absurd standing there like that.

34:35.230 --> 34:37.100
-(laughing)

34:38.140 --> 34:40.120
-Right, I should've told you, Charlie, okay?

34:40.130 --> 34:42.040
I just felt like I need to think

34:42.050 --> 34:44.210
about how I wanted to handle it first, and I'm sorry, okay?

34:44.220 --> 34:45.230
I should've sought your advice.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.090
-(sighs)

34:47.100 --> 34:48.140
Maybe I was wrong.

34:48.150 --> 34:51.010
I should've known you weren't gonna leave us all behind.

35:00.070 --> 35:01.140
-(bell ringing)

35:04.190 --> 35:06.220
-Fanta, will you please do us the honor,

35:06.230 --> 35:09.000
and let our guests know exactly what's on the menu?

35:09.010 --> 35:09.230
-Si.

35:10.130 --> 35:13.120
For dinner we are serving braised rabbit

35:13.130 --> 35:17.030
over seasoned wild mushrooms and a micro green salad.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.050
-Sounds delightful.

35:18.060 --> 35:19.120
-Let's eat then, shall we?

35:19.130 --> 35:20.160
-I'm gonna go check on Ines.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.160
-All right.

35:21.170 --> 35:22.220
-Vic: Smells good.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.130
-Good stuff.

35:30.140 --> 35:31.180
-Delicious. -(cell phone vibrating)

35:31.190 --> 35:33.020
-(indistinct chatter)

35:33.030 --> 35:34.110
-(laughter)

35:36.100 --> 35:37.210
-Fanta, that was amazing.

35:39.140 --> 35:41.010
-I've missed five calls.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.120
It's Clarence.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.060
Ortega knows we're here.

35:48.070 --> 35:49.120
-How long ago did he call?

35:49.130 --> 35:51.050
-About an hour ago.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.170
-Then we've only got about 30 minutes to get out of here.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.160
-Let's go now. Chop, chop, come on.

35:55.170 --> 35:56.170
-Ramiro,  vamos.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.010
-Ortega's onto us. We've gotta move, Al.

35:59.020 --> 35:59.230
-Fuck.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.100
All right, let's get him into a car then.

36:01.110 --> 36:03.140
-Sal is too weak to move to a car. I won't leave him.

36:03.150 --> 36:04.190
-Listen, we have to leave, okay?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.080
If you stay here, they're gonna kill you both.

36:06.090 --> 36:07.230
-No. I'll take my chances.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.050
-Clock's ticking, Al.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.020
-I'm not just gonna leave them here on their own.

36:12.050 --> 36:13.110
I've gotta stay.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.070
-I've got the diamonds.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.140
-Everybody in the motors.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.200
-Wait! Got a problem.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.160
Salazar is too ill to move.

36:30.170 --> 36:31.150
Ines won't leave him.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.220
-Where's Albert?

36:32.230 --> 36:34.220
-He won't leave her on her own. He's staying.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.160
-We need to leave now. Victor, get our son.

36:39.010 --> 36:41.040
-Albert's a grown man. He's made his decision.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.160
-And a Hill never leaves a man behind.

36:44.170 --> 36:47.050
-Couldn't have put it better myself, Charlie boy.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.130
We're short on shooters,

36:55.140 --> 36:56.210
but we'll still give those interlopers

36:56.220 --> 36:58.190
a Hill welcome they won't soon forget.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.090
Time we gotta giddy up, son.

39:33.230 --> 39:35.130
-Sal. Sal.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.210
Sal?

39:42.170 --> 39:44.110
Hey. Sal?

39:49.080 --> 39:50.100
-Ines.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.200
-Sal.

40:04.090 --> 40:05.190
-I'll save my tears

40:06.200 --> 40:10.230
until after I've brought this bastard Ortega

40:11.000 --> 40:12.030
to his knees.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.130
-Come on.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.070
-Hate 'Em: In, in. Come on, let's go.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.190
Move, move, move. Quick, quick.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.070
-(grunts) Fuck.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.050
-Vic: Go.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.050
-Hate 'Em: All right.

40:33.220 --> 40:34.220
-Where to, Al?

40:34.230 --> 40:36.090
-Back to San Toledo.

40:38.070 --> 40:39.190
We've got unfinished business.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.000
-Yes, we do.
