00:01.030 --> 00:02.489
That feels good, doesn't it?

00:02.771 --> 00:03.840
Doesn't it, honey?

00:04.231 --> 00:05.819
I got a great meal for you.

00:06.633 --> 00:07.633
Yes, I do.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.440
Yes, I do.

00:10.047 --> 00:11.333
That's a good girl.

00:11.996 --> 00:14.493
Now you finish up all those vegetables.

00:14.831 --> 00:17.414
I mixed it up for you
just the way you like it.

00:17.484 --> 00:18.555
Yes, I did.

00:19.956 --> 00:20.956
Yes, I do.

00:21.413 --> 00:22.413
Yes, I do.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.417
You're the prettiest baby on this farm.

00:24.418 --> 00:25.418
Yes, you are.

00:25.911 --> 00:26.911
Yes, you are.

00:27.464 --> 00:28.464
Harvey.

00:31.017 --> 00:32.017
Hello, James.

00:32.275 --> 00:33.686
I figured you'd be here.

00:34.927 --> 00:37.255
I heard she took
another blue ribbon on Sunday.

00:37.331 --> 00:40.625
That's right-- we're going
to Sacramento in three weeks.

00:40.733 --> 00:43.392
Now why don't you two just get
married already and make it legal?

00:43.393 --> 00:45.445
What the hell you talking about?
She's a pig.

00:45.452 --> 00:46.622
Harvey, it's a joke.

00:46.642 --> 00:47.936
Well, it wasn't funny.

00:48.498 --> 00:50.003
I was just down in the gulch.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.124
It's all still there, James.
I'm no fool.

00:52.456 --> 00:54.085
You said you'd get rid of it by Friday.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.423
Relax--
we've been neighbors, what, 15 years?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.317
- Right.
- You're a businessman, right?

00:58.318 --> 00:59.318
Right.

01:01.175 --> 01:02.175
$10,000.

01:02.727 --> 01:03.926
And I know you could use it.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.198
This isn't about the money.
It's about the law.

01:06.386 --> 01:08.299
All right, I got it.
You're a Boy Scout.

01:10.588 --> 01:11.588
15 grand.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.510
That'll buy you
a whole lot of merit badges

01:15.511 --> 01:17.891
and a pretty pink bonnet
for your girlfriend too.

01:18.858 --> 01:21.452
You keep that money, 'cause
you're gonna need it for a lawyer.

01:21.523 --> 01:23.284
I'm calling Sheriff Butterfield.

01:25.049 --> 01:26.049
Harvey, wait.

01:27.301 --> 01:28.301
Okay, you win.

01:29.111 --> 01:30.111
I'll do it.

01:30.514 --> 01:33.119
I will do it.
I promise I'll get rid of it.

01:34.917 --> 01:35.917
I promise.

01:36.668 --> 01:37.917
But I can't do it tonight.

01:38.030 --> 01:39.333
Now, I need 24 hours.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.477
That's all I'm asking--

01:41.523 --> 01:44.313
one day,
and it'll all be gone, guaranteed.

01:45.928 --> 01:46.928
Okay.

01:46.935 --> 01:47.935
24 hours.

01:48.086 --> 01:49.144
Thank you, Harvey.

01:49.684 --> 01:50.684
Good man.

01:50.783 --> 01:51.783
Good pig too.

02:32.364 --> 02:33.527
Did you hear that?

02:34.624 --> 02:35.704
I didn't hear anything.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.415
Hey, hold on!

02:38.023 --> 02:39.023
Quiet down!

02:40.435 --> 02:42.082
That sounded like a gunshot.

03:04.415 --> 03:05.537
Oh, my God.

03:07.590 --> 03:08.590
It's Nadine.

03:09.438 --> 03:11.908
How are we gonna break the news
to Harvey?

03:14.443 --> 03:15.913
I don't think we have to.

5x14 - Mr. Monk Visits A Farm

03:39.800 --> 03:41.917
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Sixe

04:34.541 --> 04:35.776
This is it, room 109.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.058
He's flushing the drugs.
We gotta take him now.

04:42.093 --> 04:43.561
The captain said to wait.

04:43.813 --> 04:45.163
No, no time.
Let's do it.

04:45.462 --> 04:47.857
Police officers!
Watch her!

04:48.068 --> 04:49.823
Show me your hands-- now!

04:49.977 --> 04:51.201
Right now!
Hands up!

04:51.260 --> 04:52.998
- Hands on the wall!
- What are you doing?

04:53.020 --> 04:55.541
What are you doing, you son of a bitch?
Against the wall...

04:55.621 --> 04:57.268
Oh, my God, leave him alone!

04:58.058 --> 04:59.455
Tell your hooker to shut up.

04:59.596 --> 05:00.758
My hooker?

05:01.029 --> 05:02.350
- Who are you?
- I'm a cop.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.539
Wanna tell me
what you just flushed down the toilet?

05:05.488 --> 05:07.237
All right, Alfonso.
We'll do it your way.

05:07.357 --> 05:10.156
- You have the right to remain silent--
- Who the hell is Alfonso?

05:10.248 --> 05:11.750
... will be used against you in a--

05:11.805 --> 05:13.056
Oh, Bernie!

05:15.010 --> 05:16.010
Get away!

05:31.710 --> 05:33.413
There he goes!
Alfonso!

05:33.674 --> 05:35.793
Police-- drop the gun!

05:37.130 --> 05:38.130
I'm, uh--

05:39.583 --> 05:40.995
I'm really sorry, mister.

05:41.066 --> 05:43.026
His name is Bernard Garrison.

05:43.541 --> 05:44.968
He is a retired lawyer.

05:45.539 --> 05:47.324
I'm not retired anymore.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.195
Yeah, I've called his house.

05:57.369 --> 05:58.875
Oh, there he is.
He just walked in.

05:58.921 --> 05:59.972
There you are.

06:00.578 --> 06:02.353
I've been trying to call you all--

06:04.633 --> 06:05.868
Randy, don't do this.

06:05.957 --> 06:07.531
It's effective as of noon today.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.428
So I have, uh, nine minutes left.

06:10.569 --> 06:13.149
If there's anything
you need me to do quickly--

06:13.322 --> 06:14.731
maybe some filing.

06:17.967 --> 06:19.775
Now it's 8 minutes and 49 seconds.

06:19.986 --> 06:22.147
Randy, I know how you feel.

06:22.706 --> 06:24.652
You screwed up.
Everybody screws up.

06:25.007 --> 06:26.007
You're right.

06:26.461 --> 06:27.872
Everybody does screw up.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.818
But I am a screwup.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.514
There's a difference.
You need to sign for those.

06:32.573 --> 06:34.322
We picked up Rivera this morning--

06:34.323 --> 06:35.323
No thanks to me.

06:36.332 --> 06:38.278
You don't have to worry about Garrison.

06:38.279 --> 06:40.229
State's Attorney's negotiating with him.

06:40.363 --> 06:42.179
He's gonna settle.
They always do.

06:46.746 --> 06:50.341
Son, this badge
represents ten years of your life.

06:51.946 --> 06:53.298
Ten years of good work.

06:54.003 --> 06:55.061
Captain, I'm done.

06:57.054 --> 06:58.054
I'm leaving.

06:58.758 --> 07:00.816
Hey, I already sublet my apartment.

07:02.012 --> 07:03.306
You remember my uncle?

07:03.567 --> 07:04.567
Uncle Harvey?

07:04.817 --> 07:05.817
Sure.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.218
The farmer.

07:08.420 --> 07:09.420
The suicide.

07:10.322 --> 07:13.204
Yeah, well,
an estate lawyer called me last week.

07:13.997 --> 07:15.054
He left me his farm.

07:15.837 --> 07:16.837
You're kidding.

07:16.983 --> 07:19.137
I know, I was gonna--
I was gonna sell the place,

07:19.138 --> 07:21.476
but, you know, after this...

07:23.138 --> 07:24.448
I'm gonna do it.

07:25.339 --> 07:27.587
- You're gonna do what?
- Take it over, run the place,

07:27.623 --> 07:29.700
- work the land.
- Work the land.

07:30.554 --> 07:33.246
What are you, Woody Guthrie?
Randy, you're not a farmer.

07:33.359 --> 07:34.829
Well, you might be right.

07:35.559 --> 07:38.766
All I know for sure is... I'm not a cop.

07:42.361 --> 07:46.110
I still can't believe
they wanted $20 to deliver this stuff.

07:46.590 --> 07:49.239
- Who's laughin' now?
- Yeah, we are. We're laughin'.

07:50.342 --> 07:52.373
Wait, wait.
Dirt-- that's dirt.

07:52.408 --> 07:54.293
You're gonna drag dirt
all through the kitchen.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.398
Wait there.
Don't move.

07:55.399 --> 07:57.502
- Come on, Mr. Monk. It's heavy!
- Don't move.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.027
Hurry.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.994
Sorry, I just--
I have a thing about dirt.

08:05.475 --> 08:07.936
It's just so dirty, you know?

08:10.038 --> 08:11.895
I'll bet that's how it got its name.

08:12.884 --> 08:13.884
Dirt.

08:14.402 --> 08:15.436
Forget it.

08:16.258 --> 08:17.373
Phone.

08:17.842 --> 08:19.650
Natalie, the telephone.

08:21.343 --> 08:22.343
I'll get it.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.545
I'll get it.

08:27.103 --> 08:28.249
It's Randy.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.170
Nothing.
Nothing much.

08:30.194 --> 08:32.715
Just helping Natalie
carry in some boxes.

08:33.258 --> 08:34.669
How's it goin' up there?

08:34.913 --> 08:37.207
Actually, Monk, that's why I'm calling.

08:37.312 --> 08:38.370
Something came up.

08:39.365 --> 08:41.188
You know about my uncle, right?

08:41.724 --> 08:43.073
Your uncle--
the dead one?

08:44.230 --> 08:45.919
<i>Well, they say he committed suicide.</i>

08:46.130 --> 08:47.331
But I started asking around,

08:47.332 --> 08:49.154
and some things just don't add up.

08:49.632 --> 08:50.749
Unless I'm wrong...

08:51.988 --> 08:53.164
which I probably am.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.724
<i>Do you think you can come up here
and take a look around?</i>

08:58.594 --> 08:59.810
You're on a farm.

09:00.246 --> 09:01.893
It'll only take a few hours.

09:02.401 --> 09:04.201
A few... hours.

09:04.408 --> 09:05.691
O- on a farm?

09:06.311 --> 09:08.425
Monk, I think somebody killed my uncle.

09:08.552 --> 09:10.652
<i>Randy, I'd like to. I really would.
But, um...</i>

09:11.852 --> 09:13.186
you're on a farm.

09:13.235 --> 09:14.418
He wants us to come up there?

09:14.522 --> 09:16.320
Mr. Monk, I can't.
Julie has school.

09:16.926 --> 09:18.723
Natalie can't come.
Sorry.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.678
Monk, you can come alone.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.522
Please. There's a bus.

09:23.085 --> 09:25.068
Bus. To a farm.

09:25.281 --> 09:26.281
A bus to the--

09:26.891 --> 09:28.691
A bus. A bus?

09:28.986 --> 09:30.319
Bus to the farm?

09:30.647 --> 09:32.444
Hey, stranger.
How's it going?

09:33.594 --> 09:35.064
Of course he'll be there.

09:35.501 --> 09:37.392
Don't be silly.
You're family.

09:38.469 --> 09:41.319
Tomorrow morning--
I will put him on the bus myself.

09:42.008 --> 09:43.041
A bus?

09:43.115 --> 09:44.515
Take care.

09:44.650 --> 09:45.667
To the farm.

10:02.076 --> 10:05.026
Thank you for letting me
keep my bags up top.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.720
Is this where I get the bus to go back?

10:26.656 --> 10:28.107
That's a lot of dirt.

11:11.522 --> 11:14.296
<i>And these changes
are like ripples on a pond.</i>

11:15.313 --> 11:16.430
<i>But is that enough?</i>

11:16.813 --> 11:19.230
<i>Are you satisfied being just a ripple?</i>

11:20.221 --> 11:22.112
No.
Not a ripple.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.691
<i>You are a tidal wave.</i>

11:25.273 --> 11:26.273
Say it with me.

11:26.870 --> 11:29.149
<i>I am a tidal wave.</i>

11:31.677 --> 11:33.382
I love and approve of myself,

11:34.847 --> 11:36.031
Mr. D.

11:36.081 --> 11:39.564
<i>- I live in the now--</i>
- Hey, tidal wave.

11:42.262 --> 11:43.412
You got company.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.808
- Who is it?
- Funny fellow, kinda nervous.

11:47.382 --> 11:48.515
Oh, it's Monk.

11:50.887 --> 11:53.312
Okay, okay.
I'm up.

11:53.684 --> 11:54.684
I'm up.

11:57.442 --> 11:59.143
Oh, hey, something smells good.

11:59.144 --> 12:00.194
What's for breakfast?

12:00.195 --> 12:02.419
It's lunch.
Been up since 5:00.

12:03.102 --> 12:05.186
- O'clock?
- Yes, o'clock.

12:05.884 --> 12:06.934
Why?

12:09.255 --> 12:10.830
I know, farm stuff.

12:11.770 --> 12:12.862
You shoulda woken me up.

12:12.863 --> 12:13.980
I did.

12:21.904 --> 12:22.940
You okay?

12:22.941 --> 12:26.232
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
It's just, you know... everything.

12:27.257 --> 12:28.901
The earth and the outdoors.

12:30.394 --> 12:33.261
All the animals and animal by-products.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.643
Well, you know, all the food you eat
comes from farms just like this.

12:37.871 --> 12:38.871
Not anymore.

12:39.881 --> 12:42.463
Not as of the last 23 minutes.

12:44.535 --> 12:45.535
Well, I love it.

12:46.383 --> 12:48.500
I used to come up here every summer,

12:48.552 --> 12:50.610
helping Uncle Harvey run the place.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.857
Still can't believe it's all mine.

12:55.658 --> 12:56.658
It's all mine.

12:57.714 --> 12:58.714
It's my farm.

12:59.014 --> 13:00.061
I own a farm.

13:00.062 --> 13:01.650
I'm the farmer in the dell.

13:01.705 --> 13:03.055
Got that tractor runnin'.

13:03.722 --> 13:04.722
Was it broken?

13:05.272 --> 13:06.389
Since Tuesday.

13:07.374 --> 13:08.609
But it's working now.

13:08.926 --> 13:11.380
Good.
Good, good man, Oates.

13:11.836 --> 13:13.634
- You feed the jerseys?
- Yes, I did.

13:13.635 --> 13:14.635
Today?

13:14.838 --> 13:16.190
No, not today, exactly.

13:16.690 --> 13:18.337
They gotta be fed every day.

13:18.343 --> 13:20.357
Animals eat every day.

13:20.891 --> 13:21.891
I'll do it.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.199
Oates, Oates, would you tell Monk
what you were telling me

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
the other day?

13:27.201 --> 13:28.955
You mean about
how you're not cut out to--

13:30.355 --> 13:31.914
Um, about Uncle Harvey.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.762
I've been working
this farm for 20 years.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.180
Your uncle was a tad peculiar,

13:38.922 --> 13:40.274
especially about Nadine.

13:40.275 --> 13:41.275
Nadine?

13:41.326 --> 13:43.626
Uh, his pig.
It was like his child.

13:44.327 --> 13:45.831
Old Harvey was a character.

13:45.832 --> 13:46.929
There's no denying it.

13:46.930 --> 13:48.988
But it was just him and me up here.

13:49.292 --> 13:51.762
I knew that man better
than I knew myself.

13:52.501 --> 13:55.054
I could live a thousand years
before I'd believe

13:55.055 --> 13:56.878
that he tried to do himself in.

13:58.958 --> 14:00.781
Monk, can I show you something?

14:05.975 --> 14:07.975
This is exactly how they found it.

14:07.979 --> 14:09.626
They were gonna tow it away,

14:09.764 --> 14:13.431
but I took another look.
Something just didn't feel right.

14:14.643 --> 14:16.047
I covered it up, and I called you.

14:16.128 --> 14:17.518
I'm glad you did.
Really?

14:18.694 --> 14:19.694
No.

14:20.450 --> 14:21.508
Where was the pig?

14:21.795 --> 14:23.578
She was right there on the road.

14:23.852 --> 14:25.713
So according to the police,

14:26.094 --> 14:30.244
your uncle was driving home,
lost control of the truck,

14:31.467 --> 14:33.408
and accidentally ran over Nadine,

14:33.470 --> 14:36.563
his beloved prize-winning
200-pound pig.

14:36.820 --> 14:39.126
She was Pig of the Year
three years in a row.

14:39.727 --> 14:42.362
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to...
to meet her.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.061
So he-- he hit Nadine,

14:45.035 --> 14:47.838
and then he careened off the road
and into the electric fence.

14:47.839 --> 14:49.255
And he realized what he had done--

14:49.288 --> 14:51.929
"Oh, my God,
I killed the Pig of the Year."

14:52.592 --> 14:54.003
And he was so depressed,

14:54.043 --> 14:58.273
he was-- he was so overcome with grief.

14:59.757 --> 15:05.409
And he grabbed the rifle
from that gun rack and killed himself.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.702
Right.
That's the official version.

15:07.859 --> 15:08.867
But look at this.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.946
Uncle Harvey
kept a handgun under the seat.

15:12.693 --> 15:15.126
Why didn't he just use it?
It would have been a lot easier.

15:15.127 --> 15:18.579
So you think he was killed by somebody
who didn't know about the handgun.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.785
Did he have any enemies?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.338
Well, I've been asking around.

15:21.339 --> 15:22.986
Two days before the accident,

15:23.495 --> 15:25.192
he was seen arguing with Jimmy Belmont.

15:25.193 --> 15:26.944
He's another farmer.
He lives up the road.

15:26.945 --> 15:28.062
Arguing about what?

15:28.553 --> 15:29.553
Nobody knows.

15:31.606 --> 15:33.157
People argue all the time, Randy.

15:33.158 --> 15:35.049
Okay, okay, I know.

15:35.363 --> 15:36.539
But what about this?

15:36.759 --> 15:38.759
How did Nadine get out of her pen?

15:39.009 --> 15:40.361
She was locked up 24/7,

15:40.367 --> 15:42.818
and she wouldn't let anybody
near her except Uncle Harvey.

15:42.819 --> 15:46.821
Okay, yeah, maybe--
maybe she was drugged.

15:46.870 --> 15:49.752
Where's the pig?
Maybe we could have them do an autopsy.

15:50.782 --> 15:52.588
- We ate her.
- You ate the pig.

15:52.832 --> 15:53.932
Yeah, I know.
I'm an idiot.

15:53.965 --> 15:55.563
- No, you didn't--
- No, I'm--

15:56.034 --> 15:57.034
See, Monk?

15:57.137 --> 15:58.607
That's why I'm not a cop.

15:59.288 --> 16:02.229
What kind of cop
eats a crucial piece of evidence?

16:08.288 --> 16:09.922
Mr. Disher.

16:11.505 --> 16:13.966
I've been telling you
all week you gotta fix your fence--

16:13.967 --> 16:15.790
you got deer all over the road.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.491
You must be the famous Mr. Monk.

16:19.034 --> 16:21.151
Disher talks about you all the time.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.482
You gonna clean his house
while you're here?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.545
He's joking.
We were jokin' with you.

16:25.743 --> 16:27.919
Welcome to Chambers County, Mr. Monk.

16:28.547 --> 16:30.344
Got a housewarming gift for you.

16:30.345 --> 16:32.756
It's the case file,
complete with photos.

16:33.003 --> 16:34.705
But you're both wasting your time.

16:34.706 --> 16:37.688
- It was a suicide, sure as shootin'.
- How do you know?

16:37.751 --> 16:39.463
Lenny and me
were the first ones up here.

16:39.464 --> 16:41.565
We were at the community center
down the hill.

16:41.566 --> 16:43.448
There's a big dance every month.

16:43.764 --> 16:45.068
Someone heard a gunshot.

16:45.069 --> 16:47.657
We were here four,
maybe five minutes later.

16:47.818 --> 16:49.591
You didn't see anybody else?

16:49.762 --> 16:51.949
He was alone.
I'm 100% sure.

16:52.275 --> 16:55.418
The irrigation sprinklers
were on, the ground was muddy,

16:55.518 --> 16:59.301
there were no footprints,
by the truck, on the road-- nowhere.

16:59.881 --> 17:02.430
It was suicide-- sad but true.

17:02.735 --> 17:04.087
Sheriff, we have to go.

17:06.144 --> 17:07.896
I'm gonna need that back.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.695
there's another dance tonight.

17:11.202 --> 17:12.672
You can bring it with ya.

17:13.046 --> 17:15.354
Well, I wasn't planning
on going to the dance tonight.

17:15.355 --> 17:16.766
I wasn't talkin' to you.

17:20.961 --> 17:22.893
Do something about those deer.

17:23.462 --> 17:24.462
Yes, ma'am.

17:26.923 --> 17:28.040
Did she wink at me?

17:28.372 --> 17:29.842
I think she winked at me.

17:34.435 --> 17:35.932
There's no footprints.

17:37.191 --> 17:38.191
Monk, I'm sorry.

17:38.597 --> 17:40.396
Guess I brought you out here
for nothing.

17:40.397 --> 17:41.397
Maybe not.

17:41.697 --> 17:42.697
Maybe not.

17:43.450 --> 17:47.605
She said that somebody
at the dance heard the gunshot.

17:48.079 --> 17:49.314
Check out who it was.

17:51.927 --> 17:53.065
Jimmy Belmont.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.662
How far away is that dance hall?

17:55.887 --> 17:57.233
I don't know. Half a mile?

17:58.340 --> 18:01.540
You really think somebody could hear
a gunshot from that far away?

18:01.541 --> 18:04.244
Especially if there was dancing
and music playing?

18:04.245 --> 18:05.421
I don't know, but...

18:07.198 --> 18:08.198
we can find out.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.345
Lemonade!

18:44.351 --> 18:45.601
I made it myself.

18:45.754 --> 18:47.113
Oh, then no, thank you.

18:49.057 --> 18:50.527
Were you here last month?

18:50.906 --> 18:51.907
I sure was.

18:51.908 --> 18:54.084
I haven't missed a dance in 12 years.

18:54.265 --> 18:55.265
Great.

18:55.313 --> 18:56.831
Did you hear the gunshot?

18:57.120 --> 18:58.505
From the Disher Farm?

18:58.522 --> 19:00.124
No, sir.
I sure didn't.

19:04.957 --> 19:08.357
Did you hear the gunshot
last month from the Disher Farm?

19:08.883 --> 19:11.530
Well, I can't say as I did,
because I didn't.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.057
I was hoping you were gonna be here.

19:16.344 --> 19:18.229
I'm going undercover tonight.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.458
What do you think?

19:24.457 --> 19:26.574
Oh, is this your first square dance?

19:27.994 --> 19:29.828
I'm not here to dance.

19:29.921 --> 19:32.332
Randy and I
have a theory about the case.

19:32.587 --> 19:34.820
Well, I have a theory too.

19:35.271 --> 19:37.506
I think you really came here to dance.

19:37.582 --> 19:38.582
Come on!

19:40.573 --> 19:41.656
I can't!

19:41.781 --> 19:42.943
I'm-- I'm married.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.440
Where's your wife?

19:45.393 --> 19:46.543
She's dead.

19:47.441 --> 19:50.323
To be honest,
I've got mixed feelings about that.

19:50.346 --> 19:53.060
On the one hand,
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:53.243 --> 19:55.505
On the other hand,
here we go!

20:02.494 --> 20:03.894
What are you afraid of?

20:04.032 --> 20:05.032
Well...

20:06.657 --> 20:08.040
it's a pretty long list.

20:13.791 --> 20:15.141
Is Jimmy Belmont here?

20:19.453 --> 20:20.453
Why?

20:23.053 --> 20:24.053
Just curious.

20:27.511 --> 20:29.395
He never comes to these things.

20:30.665 --> 20:32.282
Wasn't he here a month ago?

20:36.123 --> 20:37.358
You're right, he was.

20:43.057 --> 20:44.266
Did anybody else...

20:44.849 --> 20:48.849
besides Belmont... hear the shot?

21:00.347 --> 21:02.647
That is pretty odd,
now that you mention it.

21:31.037 --> 21:32.071
Damn it.

21:46.318 --> 21:48.950
I still can't believe
I forgot to load the gun.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.659
I tried yelling.
Did you hear anything?

21:53.562 --> 21:56.535
Standing in the middle of the road
yelling bang for 20 minutes.

21:57.728 --> 21:59.528
I'm just glad the captain wasn't there.

22:00.063 --> 22:01.239
These things happen.

22:01.472 --> 22:02.472
Yeah, to me.

22:02.670 --> 22:04.081
They happen to me, Monk.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.074
Okay, look,
our little demonstration didn't work.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.604
But you might be right
about Jimmy Belmont.

22:09.628 --> 22:13.804
That night a month ago was the
first dance he had been to in ten years.

22:14.033 --> 22:17.700
And he was the only person there
who heard the gunshot.

22:18.609 --> 22:19.892
It's pretty suspicious.

22:20.046 --> 22:21.526
Suspicion isn't proof.

22:22.595 --> 22:24.905
You know,
I'd still like to meet him, talk to him.

22:25.051 --> 22:26.088
Well, it won't be easy.

22:26.138 --> 22:29.266
Belmont never leaves his farm,
and he don't like visitors.

22:31.231 --> 22:33.115
But he is looking for a new farmhand.

22:35.914 --> 22:37.022
No, no, I can't.

22:37.848 --> 22:40.082
Randy, you know, I just can't.

22:40.221 --> 22:41.221
Fine, Monk.

22:43.979 --> 22:45.037
I don't blame you.

22:45.882 --> 22:46.882
Forget it.
Just--

22:47.631 --> 22:48.631
Forget about me.

22:53.645 --> 22:54.645
Look at us.

22:56.343 --> 22:57.343
Losers all.

23:00.350 --> 23:02.467
Hey, at least I don't have any kids.

23:05.109 --> 23:06.109
It ends with me.

23:30.105 --> 23:32.624
Mira, this is Raul y Raulito.

24:01.994 --> 24:03.294
96.

24:06.249 --> 24:07.866
97.

24:10.906 --> 24:12.006
98.

24:20.479 --> 24:21.679
99...

25:00.744 --> 25:01.761
Seven...

25:03.652 --> 25:04.652
Eight.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.367
Pastillas... a hundred.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.480
One hundred.

25:53.375 --> 25:55.225
Four salt blocks
missing.

26:03.883 --> 26:05.742
Trees.
But-- por que?

26:20.136 --> 26:21.286
Prohibited.

26:44.974 --> 26:47.524
I just asked,
"Have you got a squirrel in your pants?"

26:51.612 --> 26:53.067
You don't speak any Spanish, do you?

26:53.068 --> 26:54.068
Some.

26:54.119 --> 26:55.119
High school.

26:55.354 --> 26:57.754
You gonna tell me
what you're doing back here?

27:00.964 --> 27:03.398
You know, there are no secrets
in a town like this.

27:04.675 --> 27:07.335
I know all about you,
former Detective Adrian Monk.

27:08.432 --> 27:11.409
I heard you were dancing
with Sheriff Butterfield last night.

27:12.086 --> 27:13.086
Badly.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.382
Heard you were askin' about me.

27:17.694 --> 27:18.694
Well, here I am.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.609
Now, you wanna ask me something,
you go right ahead.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.418
What's back there?

27:25.611 --> 27:26.611
Let me guess.

27:27.362 --> 27:28.362
Fields of reefer.

27:28.862 --> 27:29.862
Fields of reefer?

27:30.259 --> 27:31.265
What kinda cop were you?

27:31.266 --> 27:32.465
You know what I mean.

27:32.466 --> 27:33.466
Ditchweed.

27:35.324 --> 27:36.757
The old Ali Baba.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.070
What makes you think that I'd actually--

27:39.071 --> 27:42.318
Magic dragon, bambalachi,
Yellow Submarine,

27:42.625 --> 27:46.205
Black Bart, Dr. Giggles, Kentucky Blue.

27:46.283 --> 27:47.688
You know what I'm talkin' about.

27:47.689 --> 27:50.435
I'm talkin' about Railroad Weed--
that's right.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.612
The Devil's Parsley.

27:51.990 --> 27:54.775
Skunk, Splim, Splam,
Mooster.

27:55.097 --> 27:56.097
Side Salad.

27:56.250 --> 27:58.863
- Side Salad.
- You've been supplementing your income.

27:58.864 --> 28:02.452
What do you have, about
4 or 5 acres of marijuana back there?

28:03.664 --> 28:05.016
Harvey Disher found it.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.102
And he was threatening to turn you in.

28:14.482 --> 28:16.596
- You killed him.
- Did I?

28:19.592 --> 28:20.592
How?

28:23.097 --> 28:25.998
See, Harvey Disher's truck
went off the road at 10:30 pm.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
That's a fact.

28:27.151 --> 28:28.503
Hit the electric fence.

28:29.604 --> 28:31.486
Everybody saw the lights go out.

28:32.561 --> 28:35.696
I was in the dance hall,
half a mile away,

28:36.969 --> 28:38.439
in front of 50 witnesses.

28:41.034 --> 28:43.401
Now, you think you got enough
for a search warrant?

28:44.787 --> 28:46.171
Yeah, I don't either.

28:47.047 --> 28:48.164
Not in this county.

28:49.203 --> 28:52.397
It's time you were headed home,
former Detective Adrian Monk.

28:52.853 --> 28:54.200
Front gate's that way.

28:55.714 --> 28:56.814
Go on ahead.

28:57.611 --> 28:58.611
Go on.

30:01.962 --> 30:03.095
Bambalachi.

30:04.826 --> 30:05.830
Reefer!

30:17.682 --> 30:18.765
Oates, thank God!

30:19.136 --> 30:20.136
Where's Randy?

30:20.283 --> 30:21.283
He's asleep.

30:21.984 --> 30:24.434
I can't help but noticing
that you're handcuffing yourself

30:24.435 --> 30:25.611
to that grain drill.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.924
I inhaled some reefer!

30:28.058 --> 30:29.124
I gotcha.

30:29.191 --> 30:30.941
It's gonna kick in any minute.

30:32.052 --> 30:33.052
Here's the thing.

30:34.252 --> 30:37.507
I can't tolerate
any drugs or medication.

30:37.687 --> 30:38.717
It's my metabolism.

30:38.718 --> 30:41.541
I don't know what--
I don't know what's gonna...

30:42.628 --> 30:43.628
happen to me.

30:45.226 --> 30:47.284
I might go berserk.

30:48.593 --> 30:49.887
I might hurt somebody!

30:53.254 --> 30:56.570
Dude... here.
Here.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.259
Listen, whatever happens,

30:59.260 --> 31:01.795
don't... don't unlock me.

31:02.214 --> 31:05.633
No matter what I say,
even if I'm begging you!

31:06.670 --> 31:07.670
Oh, my God.

31:08.077 --> 31:09.077
Here it comes.

31:09.521 --> 31:10.521
Here it comes.

31:10.579 --> 31:11.796
Oh, God!

31:12.383 --> 31:13.677
I think it's starting.

31:13.785 --> 31:16.251
We're talking about marijuana, right?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.054
Riverdance!

31:28.376 --> 31:29.565
I-- I can feel it.

31:29.566 --> 31:30.566
I'm--

31:30.717 --> 31:31.834
I'm getting hungry.

31:32.043 --> 31:33.298
Did you have dinner?

31:33.337 --> 31:35.420
We got some pecan pie in the fridge.

31:35.604 --> 31:37.104
It's the munchies!

31:38.328 --> 31:39.739
Don't-- whatever you do,

31:40.090 --> 31:41.960
don't put anything near my mouth!

31:42.089 --> 31:43.089
Can do!

31:43.594 --> 31:45.406
But I gotta say...

31:45.958 --> 31:49.070
you know,
I've had some experience in this area,

31:49.394 --> 31:51.397
and I don't think you're stoned at all.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.456
I see lights flickering!

31:56.280 --> 31:57.846
Yeah, they're fireflies.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.662
What was that?

32:04.120 --> 32:05.120
It's 8:00!

32:05.168 --> 32:06.462
Irrigation sprinklers.

32:09.665 --> 32:12.465
Do they come on
every night all over the property?

32:12.834 --> 32:13.834
Every night.

32:17.086 --> 32:18.086
Oates...

32:20.211 --> 32:24.100
I know how he did it.
I know how Belmont killed Randy's uncle.

32:26.910 --> 32:27.968
Get me outta this.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.460
Okeydoke.

32:32.647 --> 32:35.016
Son of a gun.
You solved the case.

32:35.922 --> 32:37.922
You figured all that out just now?

32:38.668 --> 32:41.018
I can't quite get a handle on you, son.

32:41.161 --> 32:43.213
One minute, you're handcuffing yourself

32:43.214 --> 32:46.711
to a piece of farm machinery,
sobbing like a schoolgirl.

32:46.768 --> 32:47.798
The next minute,

32:47.848 --> 32:51.619
you're putting all the little pieces
together like Sherlock Holmes.

32:51.684 --> 32:54.199
Which is the real Adrian Monk?

32:56.084 --> 32:57.966
I like to think that a man is...

32:58.691 --> 33:00.418
made up of many different--

33:00.453 --> 33:01.720
I think it's the schoolgirl.

33:01.748 --> 33:03.395
Yeah, you're probably right.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.408
What do we do now?

33:06.105 --> 33:07.105
Call the sheriff.

33:10.256 --> 33:11.256
What?

33:13.589 --> 33:14.656
What is it?

33:15.356 --> 33:18.504
Well, I was just thinking
it would have been nice

33:18.574 --> 33:21.835
if Randy
had been able to figure it all out.

33:22.275 --> 33:25.068
He's been feeling pretty down
about himself lately.

33:25.195 --> 33:26.228
That's true.

33:26.725 --> 33:28.558
Solving a big case like this one,

33:29.389 --> 33:31.230
he would have felt like a cop again.

33:35.993 --> 33:38.863
<i>You're a tiger, a wild carnivore,</i>

33:39.695 --> 33:41.461
<i>stalking through the jungle.</i>

33:41.754 --> 33:43.421
I'm a tiger.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.826
In the jungle.

34:00.733 --> 34:01.733
You were right.

34:02.385 --> 34:04.499
Belmont killed your uncle.

34:07.115 --> 34:08.614
Killed my uncle.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.793
Here's what happened...

34:23.324 --> 34:24.324
Morning.

34:25.127 --> 34:26.260
Any coffee left?

34:26.580 --> 34:27.580
Got a full pot.

34:28.230 --> 34:29.230
How'd you sleep?

34:31.283 --> 34:32.649
Fine, I guess.

34:42.831 --> 34:43.864
It's sour.

34:45.476 --> 34:47.005
What kind of farm is this?

34:47.475 --> 34:49.357
Don't even have any fresh cream.

34:54.542 --> 34:55.542
What is it?

34:56.391 --> 34:57.391
Mosquito.

34:59.150 --> 35:02.091
So, fill me in on what happened
on Belmont's farm.

35:02.758 --> 35:04.814
Not much to tell.
It was a dead end.

35:07.025 --> 35:08.108
Ho-how 'bout you?

35:08.759 --> 35:11.694
Any new thoughts on the case?

35:19.182 --> 35:20.216
What?

35:20.966 --> 35:22.000
what is it?

35:26.095 --> 35:27.095
No, it's nothin'.

35:28.149 --> 35:29.149
Wait!

35:34.812 --> 35:35.812
Wait a minute!

35:39.402 --> 35:40.519
My God.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.180
Call the sheriff.

35:54.299 --> 35:55.828
I think I solved the case.

35:56.606 --> 35:59.324
I told you to do something
about the deer.

35:59.502 --> 36:03.452
Actually, sheriff,
the deer in the road was a big clue,

36:03.776 --> 36:05.810
was one of the keys
to my solving the case.

36:05.893 --> 36:07.793
What case?
What am I doin' here?

36:07.877 --> 36:09.400
Sheriff, you said this was important.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.035
Well, I think
solving a murder case is important.

36:12.036 --> 36:13.388
Don't you, Mr. Belmont?

36:14.387 --> 36:15.622
Here's what happened.

36:15.739 --> 36:18.797
My uncle must have stumbled across
your secret crop.

36:19.597 --> 36:21.394
Oh, you know what I'm talking about--

36:21.495 --> 36:22.812
fields of reefer.

36:24.802 --> 36:26.866
You lured him up here.

36:27.956 --> 36:32.297
We'll never know how,
but at some point, you hit him.

36:34.165 --> 36:35.217
Probably from behind.

36:35.218 --> 36:37.215
Then you put him in his pickup truck...

36:37.785 --> 36:38.968
and you shot him.

36:39.523 --> 36:41.416
You shot him point-blank in the head.

36:42.123 --> 36:44.223
- You're delusional.
- Am I?

36:47.480 --> 36:48.480
Am I?

36:48.535 --> 36:50.153
You're doing fine, Randy.

36:52.594 --> 36:54.709
It had to look like a suicide.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.858
You need a motive.

36:57.601 --> 37:00.953
So you killed or drugged Nadine
and left her on the road.

37:01.206 --> 37:02.970
Then you backed up the truck...

37:05.263 --> 37:07.201
and put salt licks under the fender--

37:07.318 --> 37:08.914
probably the same four salt licks

37:08.915 --> 37:10.979
that are missing from your supply shed.

37:12.728 --> 37:16.263
Then you went to the dance
and made sure you were seen.

37:17.714 --> 37:19.014
It was a perfect alibi.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.932
And that is how you did it,

37:24.467 --> 37:25.600
I'm not following.

37:27.858 --> 37:29.341
I don't think you're quite done.

37:29.514 --> 37:32.164
You mentioned that part about the...

37:37.153 --> 37:38.153
sprinklers.

37:38.204 --> 37:39.204
Yes.

37:39.857 --> 37:41.107
I'm not done yet.

37:41.462 --> 37:42.512
The sprinklers!

37:43.184 --> 37:47.025
At 8:00, the sprinklers kicked on
and melted the blocks of salt.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.023
Touchdown!

37:51.921 --> 37:53.285
When the lights flickered,

37:53.732 --> 37:56.365
you were half a mile away
in front of 50 witnesses.

37:57.747 --> 38:00.464
As pretty a piece of homicide
as I've ever encountered.

38:02.897 --> 38:03.897
Where were you?

38:03.954 --> 38:05.742
I-- I guess I just--

38:05.821 --> 38:06.904
I don't know.

38:07.693 --> 38:08.760
I understand.

38:09.018 --> 38:11.052
You're in a slump.
Don't worry-- I've been there.

38:11.118 --> 38:12.902
Just give it time, you'll be back.

38:13.772 --> 38:15.124
It would explain a lot.

38:15.231 --> 38:16.648
It would explain everything,

38:16.775 --> 38:17.892
including the deer.

38:18.532 --> 38:20.120
They were lickin' the salt.

38:20.205 --> 38:22.322
Now, thatis a nice story.

38:25.891 --> 38:27.185
See, that's all it is.

38:29.197 --> 38:30.314
Where's your proof?

38:32.050 --> 38:33.933
Physical proof.

38:35.270 --> 38:36.858
You don't have any, do you?

38:42.656 --> 38:43.889
I think he's right.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.769
Sheriff, do you have an evidence bag?

38:55.395 --> 38:56.395
Monk, your pen.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.140
This truck was never touched
or moved, right?

39:14.131 --> 39:15.131
Yes.

39:15.785 --> 39:17.020
That's a fingerprint.

39:18.738 --> 39:19.738
See that?

39:20.301 --> 39:21.735
If this is your fingerprint,

39:23.449 --> 39:26.313
that means you were the last person
to operate that vehicle.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.353
Is that proof enough?

39:33.449 --> 39:34.732
Could you wait in the cruiser?

39:39.263 --> 39:40.930
You have the right to an attorney...

39:44.135 --> 39:45.487
Do the people a favor--

39:45.737 --> 39:47.738
get your butt back to San Francisco.

39:47.739 --> 39:48.739
You are a cop.

39:49.197 --> 39:50.491
You don't belong here.

39:51.947 --> 39:54.190
Mr. Monk, I don't know where you belong.

39:54.354 --> 39:56.589
I got a feeling you don't know either.

39:56.812 --> 39:59.400
But if you're ever
in Chambers County again,

39:59.722 --> 40:01.290
bring your dancing shoes.

40:04.379 --> 40:06.068
Gentlemen, now if you'll excuse me,

40:06.134 --> 40:08.034
I got a prisoner to process.

40:18.244 --> 40:19.244
What?

40:19.695 --> 40:20.695
Nothing.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.430
Why are you smiling?

40:24.664 --> 40:26.164
I'm just proud to know you.

40:26.165 --> 40:27.282
That was good work.

40:33.083 --> 40:34.083
What?

40:37.032 --> 40:38.208
Why are you smiling?

40:41.138 --> 40:43.843
Well, I guess
I need to talk to the chief now.

40:43.972 --> 40:46.207
No, you don't need to talk to anybody.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.213
I never sent it down.

40:48.878 --> 40:49.878
You've been sick.

40:50.434 --> 40:51.551
You had meningitis.

40:53.038 --> 40:54.038
What's this?

40:54.337 --> 40:55.337
I have a--

40:55.542 --> 40:56.894
I have a new technique.

40:56.898 --> 41:00.069
Go to sleep, wake up,
case is solved.

41:01.349 --> 41:02.349
Good for you.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.393
I don't know how I do it.
It just happens.

41:04.603 --> 41:06.367
Here, what are you working on?

41:06.444 --> 41:08.477
A double homicide in the Castro--

41:08.558 --> 41:09.734
Great, I'll take it.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.160
Cold case?

41:12.319 --> 41:13.572
Good, I'll take that one too.

41:19.005 --> 41:20.005
I missed you too.

41:26.606 --> 41:27.606
All right.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.607
See ya in a couple of hours.

41:32.332 --> 41:34.767
Just try to keep it down a little bit.
