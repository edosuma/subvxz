MIKE: Whoa, Marquess!
My Cal Bears are all over

00:12.380 --> 00:14.713
your Iowa State Cyclones, man.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.248
Huh, what's that?

00:16.250 --> 00:19.918
Your Iowa State Cyclones are
going down, baby.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.120
My what?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.254
Your Cyclones.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.722
They're going down.

-Okay, um...

00:32.800 --> 00:34.933
I don' know what you're
talking about, I don't...

00:34.935 --> 00:36.168
Ugh. Is this a sport?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.436
In your face, Marquess!

00:37.438 --> 00:39.471
In your face!

00:39.473 --> 00:42.141
Michael, it's a little early
for a crotch chop.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.344
Golden Bears! Golden Bears!
Golden Bears!

00:45.346 --> 00:47.312
Michael, what are you doing?

00:47.314 --> 00:49.648
I am trash-talking you,
Marquess.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.117
Bear Nation, Bear Pride!

00:52.119 --> 00:54.253
Don't worry
how much you get high.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.288
What does that even mean?

00:56.290 --> 00:59.491
We were hibernating,
but now we are awake!

00:59.493 --> 01:01.994
(GROWLS)
Us bears are in the rivers,

01:01.996 --> 01:03.328
eating all the salmon,

01:03.330 --> 01:05.464
but the salmons aren't salmon.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.500
They're the Iowa State
Cyclone salmon!

01:08.502 --> 01:11.503
Hey, weren't you rooting
for Iowa State, like,
10 minutes ago?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.806
I was, but they're losing.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.674
So, now I'm a Cal Bear guy.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.509
Fair weather fan,
always have been.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.445

01:52.880 --> 01:54.913
Oh, ooh, let's go.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.849
Oh, you... You want me
to pause the game?

01:56.851 --> 01:58.884
Nah, I don't care
about college football.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.019
If any of them was that good,
they'd be in the pros.

MAN 2: (ON TV)
<i>...got hair coming out</i>

02:07.360 --> 02:09.061
What the (BLEEP) is that?

02:09.063 --> 02:11.029
It's a Bermuda rock slide.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.699
It's basically a Mexican rock
slide, but instead of tequila,

02:13.701 --> 02:15.134
you sub rum.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.069
Why do...

02:17.071 --> 02:19.671
-You want me to make you one?
-Sure.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.906
(SCOFFS)

02:22.075 --> 02:23.575
What? You offered.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.844
Yeah, well, I know.
I was just being polite.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.546
So, you're not going
to make me a drink,

02:27.548 --> 02:30.415
even though you asked me
if you could make me a drink?

02:30.417 --> 02:34.353
Well, they take a long time,
I have to muddle hibiscus.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.587
So, get muddling!

02:35.589 --> 02:36.788
What, I...

02:36.790 --> 02:38.991
(SLURPING)

02:40.126 --> 02:41.927
-Asshole.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:41.929 --> 02:43.095
Read the mystery, honey.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.263

02:44.265 --> 02:45.597
(READING)

02:49.903 --> 02:51.570
I don't get it.
What's the mystery?

02:51.572 --> 02:52.738
I don't think it's a mystery.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.273
It's a straight up
advertisement.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.275
And it worked,
it got my attention.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.411
Let's go,
let's go buy some shit.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.713
To the mystery mobile.

(HUMMING A TUNE)

03:38.351 --> 03:41.019
Ah, no, I'll get the door too.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.656
I mean, Pigeon, I'm sorry,
but you could've
actually waited

03:44.658 --> 03:46.058
to take the drink yourself.

03:51.998 --> 03:54.233
It's very full, so here.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.903
-You got it?
-I got it.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.305
Oh! (GASPS)

Oh, I thought you had it.

(SIGHS)

04:03.477 --> 04:04.843
Seatbelt, Marquess.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.612
I got it, Michael.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.347
-MARQUESS: I know how to
put that on!
-(ENGINE STARTING)

04:15.355 --> 04:16.655
Well, I'm just so pleased

04:16.657 --> 04:18.857
these things will find
a new home.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.326
My husband would've wanted it
that way.

04:21.328 --> 04:24.696
Oh, did he pass away?
I'm so sorry.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.964
Thank you.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.033
Victor was the love
of my life.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.368
We were soulmates.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.370
Married for 43 years.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.372
Hey, how much
for that stationary bike?

04:33.374 --> 04:36.208
Uh, does $50 sound fair?

04:36.210 --> 04:38.377
-I'll give you $20.
-Michael.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.678
How much for the desk?

04:39.680 --> 04:42.381
Oh, that was Victor's desk.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.483
-I didn't ask that.
-Dad!

04:44.485 --> 04:47.219
It's okay, Yung.
It's all part of the haggle.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.388
-They like it.
-Uh, $40?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.189
No way, Jose. $30.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.191
But then you've got
to throw in the silverware.

04:53.193 --> 04:56.028
This was my grandmother's
silverware.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.496
Hey, let me ask you something.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.231
Did anyone ever put
these forks

04:59.233 --> 05:00.932
-up their butt or buttholes?
-Oh!

05:00.934 --> 05:02.434
Excuse me?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.336
I know it's an uncomfortable
question, ma'am,

05:04.338 --> 05:06.738
but I'll kick myself
if I didn't ask.

05:06.740 --> 05:10.275
I can't imagine anyone doing
anything like that.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.344
I'll tell you what,
throw in the necklace

05:12.346 --> 05:13.945
and we'll call it even.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.915
Oh, this isn't for sale.
I couldn't part with this.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.017
Hmm.
Then just give me that VCR.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.225
So, we're just going
to leave the desk here?

05:27.227 --> 05:29.261
Yeah, now we have
a reception area.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.096
And when people come over,
we'll be like,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.465
"Can I help you?"
And they'll be like,

05:33.467 --> 05:36.034
"Hey, I'm here to see
the Mike Tyson Mystery Team."

05:36.036 --> 05:38.036
And we'll be like,
"It'll just be a moment."

05:38.038 --> 05:39.938
Why don't you just take a seat
on this stationary bike

05:39.940 --> 05:41.573
while you're waiting.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.408
And they'll be like,
"Do you validate for parking?"

05:43.410 --> 05:46.311
And we'll be like, "Yes, we do
let me stamp your ticket."

05:46.313 --> 05:47.779
Now, where's my stamp?

05:49.449 --> 05:50.949
What the (BLEEP) is this?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.287
Well, it's a bunch
of old letters.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.588
(GASPS)

05:56.590 --> 05:58.390
They're love letters
to Victor.

05:58.392 --> 06:01.126
Oh, that's that woman's
husband who died.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.627
He must've saved
all the love letters

06:02.629 --> 06:04.463
his wife ever wrote him.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.398
That poor woman would
want these.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.266
-We should take them back.
-PIGEON:
"My dearest Victor..."

06:08.268 --> 06:11.470
"As the leaves begin to fall,
my heart aches"

06:11.472 --> 06:13.905
"longing for your embrace,"
blah, blah, blah.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.341
Never mentions her (BLEEP).
I don't want these.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.143
To the mystery mobile!

06:18.145 --> 06:19.845
Does anybody need me
to validate their parking

06:19.847 --> 06:21.713
before they go?

06:23.483 --> 06:25.484
We know how much
you miss your husband,

06:25.486 --> 06:27.319
and though
we can't bring him back,
we have something for you

06:27.321 --> 06:30.655
that we hope, at the very
least, will bring you comfort.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.657
Victor must've loved you
a great deal.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.026
He saved all these love
letters you wrote him.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.496
I didn't write this.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.431
I didn't write any of these.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.699
Who's Cathy?

06:41.334 --> 06:42.768
Oh, my God.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.669
Oh, my God.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.005
Victor, you son of a bitch!

06:47.007 --> 06:48.540
How could you?

06:48.542 --> 06:51.176
You were having an affair
with this whore?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.678
My whole life
has been a lie.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.714
(SOBBING)

06:55.716 --> 06:58.016
My heart hurts.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.184
(GASPING)

06:59.186 --> 07:00.519
Are you okay?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.020
My heart!

07:02.022 --> 07:03.422
-(WHISPERS) Oh, dear God.
-My heart!

07:06.893 --> 07:08.527
YUNG HEE: Oh, no.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.262
-Is she...
-Mmm.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.200
-We should...
-Take her necklace.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.135
No! Call someone.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.137
All right.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.340
-(PHONE DIALING)
-Wait a second.
This one's unopened.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.543
And it's from Victor to Cathy.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.311
-He never mailed it.
-Well, open it.

07:26.313 --> 07:29.881
Maybe he talks
about Cathy's (BLEEP).

07:29.883 --> 07:32.551
Pigeon, no! We are not
going to open it.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.187
We need to find this Cathy
and give it to her. Maybe...

07:35.189 --> 07:37.222
Maybe then there
can be some kind of closure

07:37.224 --> 07:38.890
to this awful situation.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.092
Yeah, uh-huh.
Uh-huh. I hear you.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.527
Is that the police?

07:42.529 --> 07:44.062
No, it's Deezy. He wants
to know if I want to be

07:44.064 --> 07:45.864
a presenter at the
Hip Hop Awards.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.165
(BLEEP) yeah, I do!

07:47.167 --> 07:48.767
As long as my
Iowa State Cyclones

07:48.769 --> 07:50.335
aren't playing that day.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.103
I really think they'll go
all the way this year,

07:52.105 --> 07:53.839
I really do.
Maybe not.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.247
Can I help you?

08:02.249 --> 08:03.915
Hello, we're looking
for a Cathy Walker.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.550
Does she still live here?

08:05.552 --> 08:08.220
No. I've never heard of anyone
named Cathy Walker.

08:08.222 --> 08:11.590
Allan, I'll take care of this.
You go back to the party.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.858
Yes, Mother.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.060
You're looking
for Cathy Walker?

08:15.062 --> 08:18.964
I haven't heard that name
in almost 30 years.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.298
Do you know her?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.766
Oh, little boy,

08:21.768 --> 08:24.669
I was her.
Come inside.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.139
Oh, whose birthday is it?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.474
Why would you ask that?

08:29.476 --> 08:30.942
You don't know any of these
(BLEEP) people.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.278
Who gives a shit
whose birthday it is?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.280
Actually, it's my birthday.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.948
We're about to have cake.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.885
Well, congratu
(BLEEP) lations.

08:39.887 --> 08:43.655
So, what did you mean when you
said you were Cathy Walker?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.291
I was a spy
for the Soviet Union.

08:46.293 --> 08:49.394
My real name is Katia Petrova.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.162
I spent the Cold War
living here

08:51.164 --> 08:53.098
under cover as an American.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.567
But I grew to love this
country and I stopped

08:55.569 --> 08:58.069
passing information
to the KGB.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.604
How did you find me?

08:59.606 --> 09:00.705
We found this.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.308
Victor.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.943
He was my contact.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.312
