00:01.535 --> 00:04.603
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.605 --> 00:06.338
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:10.409
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:10.411 --> 00:12.277
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.747
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:14.749 --> 00:18.183
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:21.453
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.455 --> 00:24.556
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:29.163 --> 00:30.696
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:30.698 --> 00:34.066
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:34.068 --> 00:37.736
                War, pestilence,
               famine and death.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.638
             Rose:
 <i> If those four horsemen succeed</i>
     <i> in breaking the seals,</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:42.174
           <i> We can all</i>
    <i> kiss humanity good-bye.</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:44.643
        Sergeant andrews
  will escort you to your car.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.045
 What is it that you're hiding?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.446
              I swiped this from
                the impact site.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.614
               Where's the rock?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.382
              Excuse me. Hey!

00:50.384 --> 00:51.517
                            Hey!

00:53.788 --> 00:56.321
         Twice is a coincidence;

00:56.323 --> 00:57.623
          <i> Three times,</i>
   <i> that's definitely a sign.</i>

00:57.625 --> 01:00.192
      Welcome to abaddon.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.593
       <i> I think whoever's</i>
    <i> behind abaddon could be</i>

01:01.595 --> 01:02.795
  The horseman of pestilence.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.229
             You think abaddon's
                   about to make

01:04.230 --> 01:05.431
                 Another strike?
Vera:
If they are,

01:05.433 --> 01:07.299
        <i> We have 36 hours</i>
       <i> to figure it out.</i>

01:07.301 --> 01:08.801
  I need this wired
   into my account.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.402
            The man:
  <i> It says insufficient funds.</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:11.770
    You know what they say--

01:11.772 --> 01:13.672
 When you fall, you fall hard.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.789
             Erin:
<i>Are we sure abaddon's connected</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:33.258
     To the next horseman?
Yeah, joshua's vision

01:33.260 --> 01:35.461
      Led us to abaddon's
       cockroach symbol.
So did the signs

01:35.463 --> 01:37.129
Vera and i saw all day.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.864
Cockroaches were
popping up everywhere.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.632
             Nasty.
      (sighs): No kidding.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.668
  All right, what do we know
        about abaddon?
                     Aren't they

01:42.670 --> 01:44.269
           Some kind
   of anarchist hacker group?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.637
           All about
   bringing down the system?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.206
        Erin: I don't know,
        but if what they're

01:47.208 --> 01:48.440
Plotting is the sin that breaks

01:48.442 --> 01:49.541
  The next horseman's seal...

01:49.543 --> 01:51.143
   Then every minute counts.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.779
Peter, how much time is left
on abaddon's countdown clock?

01:55.149 --> 01:57.182
About 35 hours.
     Erin: Well, do we know

01:57.184 --> 01:58.650
Anything
about their leader?
                    Nobody does.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.852
             That's the problem.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.653
 Abaddon's all about anonymity.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.389
    Every member's identity
 is a secret, even the leader.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.126
       It's gonna be hard
       to find a way in.
You're right. Look,

02:07.128 --> 02:09.161
 It may have been easy to find
 that clock, but it's not like

02:09.163 --> 02:10.496
         There's a link
    to send them an e-mail.

02:10.497 --> 02:11.530
Groups like abaddon like to hide

02:11.532 --> 02:13.298
On the deep web.
To be honest,

02:13.300 --> 02:14.833
I don't even know
where to start.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.636
    (phone vibrates, rings)
                      excuse me.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.672
     Hey, alan, i'm kind of
  in the middle of something.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.242
This can't wait. Listen, the van
  that took off from leo's lab

02:23.244 --> 02:24.376
  With our meteorite sample...

02:24.378 --> 02:25.677
          Yeah, yeah.
          My cousin's

02:25.679 --> 02:27.412
      Finally got a match
     on the license plate.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.581
  It's registered to a ranger
  station up in the mountains.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.582
         How far away?

02:30.584 --> 02:31.917
    It's a pretty decent drive,

02:31.919 --> 02:33.652
    So we should probably
 head off soon, like tonight.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.855
    Okay, give me an hour--
i just got to talk to somebody.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.896
              ¶ ¶

03:08.255 --> 03:09.755
Hey, baby,
what do you got for me?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.490
            You got to try this.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.724
                      It's nuts.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.693
        (snorts)

03:16.564 --> 03:19.498
           (distorted, echoing):
               You feeling okay?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.334
     (distorted, echoing):
  What... What is this stuff?

03:22.336 --> 03:24.903
    It's truth serum, bitch.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.673
         Abaddon stole my money.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.709
                Now you're gonna
            help me get it back.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.252
      ¶ you were too tired
         to notice... ¶

03:40.254 --> 03:41.620
Hey.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.255
What are you working on?

03:43.257 --> 03:45.691
  Sounded like you guys needed
    some help with abaddon.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.726
              (tapping keyboard)

03:47.728 --> 03:48.961
              ¶ ¶

03:48.963 --> 03:52.598
           Since when
    are <i> you</i> a computer nerd?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.999
           I grew up
    in a rough neighborhood.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.601
  Spent a lot of time indoors.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.503
           Are these
    social security numbers?

03:58.505 --> 04:01.406
        Nadia: I found them
on some old bills in the garage.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.708
Turns out abaddon is recruiting,

04:02.710 --> 04:04.476
      And in order to get
        a face-to-face,

04:04.478 --> 04:06.511
     You either got to give them
         three stolen identities

04:06.513 --> 04:08.614
Or solve some decryption puzzle.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.249
 Let's just say door number one
         seemed easier.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.918
       Whoa, we can't use
      this family's info.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.355
It's not who we are.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.524
        So you're gonna pull the
           angel card on me now?

04:19.526 --> 04:23.328
  Fine. But don't come crying
       to me if we spend

04:23.330 --> 04:26.331
  The rest of our teens trying
     to crack this puzzle.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.869
       Man: <i> What the hell</i>
   <i> do you want from me, lady?</i>

04:30.871 --> 04:34.606
      I already told you,
     i don't know anything!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.675
           (panting)

04:36.677 --> 04:38.910
        Seriously, lady,
    you got to cut me down.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.612
                I can't breathe.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.516
          Look, larry,

04:44.518 --> 04:47.286
     I could play solitaire
           all night.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.687
                  (panting)

04:48.689 --> 04:51.556
                      (grunting)

04:51.558 --> 04:53.358
                       (panting)

04:55.029 --> 04:58.697
      (indistinct chatter,
       chickens clucking)

04:58.699 --> 05:00.499
              Man:
          Who's next?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.768
 Opportunity only knocks once,

05:02.770 --> 05:05.003
            My friends. Whoa-ho!

05:05.005 --> 05:09.007
        You never know when it's
        gonna be your lucky day.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.375
                  Hey!

05:12.379 --> 05:13.378
                  Stop that kid!

05:13.380 --> 05:15.681
       (speaks cantonese)

05:33.367 --> 05:35.934
                Nice job. Let me
                  see your take.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.937
       It was a good day.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.605
      Thanks to you, koa.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.741
              Man:
         How touching.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.676
      A family of cheats.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.011
            Here.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.079
Take it.

05:49.016 --> 05:49.915
             Run, koa!

05:49.917 --> 05:51.616
           (grunting)

05:56.623 --> 05:58.123
            (grunts)

06:00.894 --> 06:03.095
              Koa:
            Father!

06:03.097 --> 06:04.496
            Oh!

06:04.498 --> 06:06.865
(crying):
Please, no.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.803
               You got to listen
                    to me, okay?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.071
                 I swear to god,

06:13.073 --> 06:15.841
I've never met abaddon's leader.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.957
 He must be finding half-assed
   members like you somehow.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.525
Or would you rather die

06:33.527 --> 06:36.128
To protect some
pathetic hacker's secret?

06:36.130 --> 06:38.730
             He's trying to make
                 abaddon bigger.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.833
   He's been meeting recruits
 in coffee shops all over town.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.068
         Where exactly?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.737
                 There's one
            on west 33rd street.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.873
                 That's where he
                   is this week.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.776
              (trembling breath)

06:50.778 --> 06:52.611
         Thanks, larry.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.846
 It was nice hanging with you.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.584
            (crying):
             Wait.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.653
    (footsteps approaching)

07:04.525 --> 07:05.957
                            Hey.
Hey.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.427
You going somewhere?

07:08.429 --> 07:09.594
             Yeah.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.862
        Alan called me.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.831
         We got a lead
    on the stolen meteorite.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.699
   I know that we're looking
       for the horsemen,

07:14.701 --> 07:15.834
     But this is important.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.603
      Vera...
        Just please hear me out.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.439
    That meteor is directly
    connected to the devil,

07:20.441 --> 07:23.575
  And the devil has my son, so
this is something i have to do.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.610
        Please don't try
    to talk me out of this.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.713
     Vera, i was gonna say
     i think you should go.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.115
               You do?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.217
       Yeah. I think you
    might be onto something.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.852
               All right. I have
                   to get going,

07:33.854 --> 07:35.454
               'cause we need to
                  leave tonight.
Okay,

07:35.456 --> 07:37.122
   But, vera, please don't...

07:37.124 --> 07:39.958
            (sighs)
    don't tell alan about us

07:39.960 --> 07:41.726
         Or our gifts.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.129
       Why? Nadia knows.
   I mean, she's an outsider.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.231
     Nadia's father died--
       we had no choice.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.866
But to be honest,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.601
       I worry about her.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.837
       If you share what
     we're doing with alan,

07:51.839 --> 07:55.040
       You could put him
  in the same kind of danger.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.576
        And this scar...

07:57.578 --> 08:01.646
          Is from when
    i wrestled a polar bear.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.150
     (both roar playfully)
      erin: Okay, you two,
       it's time for bed.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.919
        But raul was telling me
            about his scars.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.788
                Oh.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.122
   Well, i'll tell you what,
           sunshine,

08:11.124 --> 08:12.491
If you go to bed
right now,

08:12.493 --> 08:14.159
         I'll tell you
      about the scar i got

08:14.161 --> 08:16.495
       When i got zapped
     from an electric eel.
                       (giggles)

08:16.497 --> 08:18.563
         Mom has a scar.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.698
          No, i don't.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.066
   Yes, you do-- right there.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.539
That's just a bruise, sweetie--
    i bumped into something.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.175
               Come on, go brush
                     your teeth.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.010
                Do i have to?
                            Yes.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.013
           (roaring)
                       (squeals)

08:42.155 --> 08:44.689
What are you guys
up to?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.858
    Um... N-not much.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.628
        I'm helping you
      track down abaddon.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.063
Nadia...

08:52.065 --> 08:53.765
 I don't think it's a good idea

08:53.767 --> 08:56.101
For you to get any more involved
     than you already are.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.637
    Okay, but if she solves
    this crazy puzzle thing,

08:58.639 --> 09:01.072
     We might get a meeting
         with abaddon.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.608
Crazy is right.
It's like

09:03.610 --> 09:05.610
               Some rubik's cube
                       on crack.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.679
             Nadia:
     I told you this could

09:07.681 --> 09:10.282
                   Take a while.
     We don't have a while.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.551
       I'm doing my best.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.286
       Maybe i can help.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.024
You know

09:19.026 --> 09:20.225
        About computers?

09:20.227 --> 09:23.261
        Ha. I can barely
    check my e-mail, but...

09:23.263 --> 09:26.731
       I do have a knack
    for languages, remember?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.300
(tapping keyboard)

09:30.737 --> 09:31.836
                       Whoa! How
                      did you...

09:31.838 --> 09:33.271
        Congratulations,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.574
You have passed the first test.
         Now it's time

09:35.576 --> 09:38.777
  For us to meet face-to-face.
     A time and a location

09:38.779 --> 09:40.245
  Will be sent to you shortly.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.180
      Our mission requires
       total commitment.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.783
    There are corrupt forces
      aligned against us,

09:44.785 --> 09:47.018
     Plaguing our system--
          their greed

09:47.020 --> 09:49.187
   Is an infection, a virus.
            Join us

09:49.189 --> 09:50.922
   And be a part of the cure.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.124
Are you hearing the kind
of language he's using?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.760
   Plague, infection, virus.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.762
         If you ask me,
   he sounds like he could be

09:57.764 --> 10:00.599
  The horseman of pestilence.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.134
        (birds chirping)

10:10.043 --> 10:12.811
        What's so great
   about the great outdoors?

10:12.813 --> 10:15.080
What, you don't
like camping?
             Well, that depends.

10:15.082 --> 10:18.683
               You want to share
                 a sleeping bag?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.152
                       Hi.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.887
What can i do
you folks for?

10:22.889 --> 10:25.090
         We were actually hoping
       to get a lay of the land.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.758
     Ah, romantic getaway?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.227
                      Uh...
     You know it.
Me and my boo are just,

10:29.229 --> 10:31.296
  Uh, freaks for nature.
Well, you've come

10:31.298 --> 10:32.831
      To the right place.

10:32.833 --> 10:33.932
Let me show you what

10:33.934 --> 10:35.233
This beautiful park
has to offer.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.836
We've got a grade-a
campsite right here

10:37.838 --> 10:39.904
On the bank of the river.
    I, uh, forgot something
     in the car, honeybee.

10:39.906 --> 10:40.972
      I'll be right back.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.841
                      Okay. Now,

10:42.843 --> 10:44.776
         Is that where
   the owl moth sanctuary is?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.144
         'cause i hear
      it's mating season.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.787
                         Gotcha.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.070
...So the feeding's
very important.
                  Okay.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.405
That's impressive
that you knew...

11:13.407 --> 11:15.206
           Excuse me.
Are you ready to go, butternut?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.775
                            Yes.
               I just can't wait
                  another second

11:16.777 --> 11:18.877
  To get all snuggly with you
         in that tent.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.011
                           Okay!
                      Thank you,
                  thanks.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.347
                I appreciate it.
    You kids have fun.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.296
      We've got a problem.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.838
             Nadia:
          <i> Any contact</i>

11:46.840 --> 11:48.173
               From abaddon yet?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.441
(heavy sigh)

11:49.443 --> 11:51.710
No, not yet.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.446
But i've been doing some reading
 on the banks that got hacked.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.448
     One was in hong kong,
       one was in philly,

11:56.450 --> 11:58.183
       And the other was
    garreth fletcham's bank

11:58.185 --> 11:59.951
           In dallas.
       There's got to be

11:59.953 --> 12:01.720
        Some connection
     between them, though.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.756
      Can't you just, like, pray
    for the answer or something?

12:04.758 --> 12:06.825
  That is not how this works.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.060
           I'm sorry,
it's still a little hard for me

12:09.062 --> 12:10.962
To wrap my head around all this.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.765
       It does have a way
    of testing your beliefs.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.502
           Did your parents make
               you go to church?

12:21.742 --> 12:23.975
    I never knew my parents.

12:25.445 --> 12:29.414
  They gave me up for adoption
       when i was a baby.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.818
  I'm... Sorry, i didn't know.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.954
           It's okay.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.922
      My dad dying, it...

12:37.924 --> 12:40.291
        It's been tough.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.861
    But at least i knew him.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.463
                Not meeting your
                parents, that...

12:45.465 --> 12:47.966
       Seems impossible.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.501
Yeah.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.436
       It's kind of hard
   to have faith in anything

12:51.438 --> 12:53.238
      When you don't know
      where you come from.

12:54.975 --> 12:59.811
   Maybe for now it's enough
   to know where you belong.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.092
  You sure this is gonna work?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.327
           It worked
   last time i lost my phone.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.164
          Funny story, actually.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.100
           I met a girl at a ufo
  convention in vegas last year,

13:22.102 --> 13:24.269
            And somehow my phone
        wound up stuck in her...

13:24.271 --> 13:26.137
         Great. Story.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.173
            Awesome.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.008
                 Suitcase.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.577
     I was gonna say "suitcase."

13:34.014 --> 13:35.880
             Right.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.549
    You talk to leo lately?

13:37.551 --> 13:41.419
What? Wh-why'd you ask me that?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.021
    I don't know. It just...

13:43.023 --> 13:45.156
 Seemed like you two had a lot
        to catch up on.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.458
         I don't know.
  It happened a long time ago.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.561
          I'm not sure
   i want to dig up the past.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.831
        Did you tell him
     he's michael's father?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.903
    He <i> is</i> michael's father.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.005
      I was just guessing.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.574
    Are you gonna tell him?

14:03.543 --> 14:06.411
                           Look,
                      i'm sorry.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.413
             I know this must be
              very hard for you.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.282
                I just... I want
                     you to know

14:11.284 --> 14:13.318
        I'm here if you need me.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.624
         Wait a second.
     This isn't on the map.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.160
Nope, it's not.
End of the road.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.998
        (birds chirping)

14:37.944 --> 14:39.644
       What do you think?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.946
     Looks like we're going
          for a hike.

14:45.986 --> 14:49.187
         (crow cawing)

14:49.189 --> 14:52.957
           (whirring)
             peter:
           <i> Uh, guys?</i>

14:52.959 --> 14:55.093
             Check it out. So, i
           found a news article,

14:55.095 --> 14:57.362
And it looks like all the banks
targeted by abaddon

14:57.364 --> 14:58.997
Have one thing
in common.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.266
They all have assets
in a company called nero health.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.067
                       That's an
              insurance company.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.069
            They also own a huge
           network of hospitals.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.938
                Houston memorial
                 is one of them.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.239
            It looks
   like all those hospitals,

15:08.241 --> 15:09.607
  Their systems are connected

15:09.609 --> 15:11.442
    Through the same digital
            network.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.378
    I wonder, if the hacker
     was going after nero,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.246
    Then the banks were just
       a means to an end.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.149
             Nadia:
       You got an e-mail.
    Maybe it's from abaddon.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.387
    "attention, new recruit.
   If you'd like to join us,

15:22.389 --> 15:24.255
   "let's meet today at noon.
        Mug & spoon café

15:24.257 --> 15:26.991
         On west 33rd."

15:26.993 --> 15:28.326
                           Damn,
                     we're good.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.261
      I was just thinking
        the same thing.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.930
                   Hey, you guys
                       stay here

15:31.932 --> 15:34.198
           And see what else you
        can find out about nero.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.266
      Where are you going?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.169
    To get a cup of coffee.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.941
      (indistinct chatter)

15:42.943 --> 15:46.477
      ¶ i've been looking
   for the king of diamonds ¶

15:48.415 --> 15:54.085
         ¶ but i guess
      the queen will do ¶

15:54.087 --> 15:59.090
      ¶ i've been looking
   for the king of diamonds ¶

16:00.660 --> 16:04.362
¶ till the dealer gave me you ¶

16:05.598 --> 16:10.635

16:12.172 --> 16:14.372
            (chime)

16:14.374 --> 16:17.375
          What the...?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.243
    <i> (koa speaking cantonese)</i>

16:23.249 --> 16:26.451
Easy, dirtbag.
You're coming with me.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.687
      (patrons screaming)

16:33.093 --> 16:35.460
           (grunting)

16:35.462 --> 16:36.761
           (panting)

16:36.763 --> 16:40.531
           (grunting)

17:07.460 --> 17:09.794
           (shouting)

17:13.199 --> 17:15.098
Who are you? Are you with them?
                           Rose:
                             No.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.468
  Raul, stop. She's one of us.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.257
      (indistinct chatter)

17:39.259 --> 17:42.293
             Raise.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.564
           $200,000.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.773
All in.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.212
             Call.

18:04.517 --> 18:08.319
                     Full house.
(chuckles)

18:13.426 --> 18:14.592
                         Four of
                         a kind.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.127
We have
a winner.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.144
      (gasping, murmuring)

18:33.146 --> 18:34.545
              Man:
        Check her pulse.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.316
         Wait a minute.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.885
         What is this?

18:40.887 --> 18:44.422
           (gasping)
dead or alive,
she's a cheat.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.462
   So you did feel the wave.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.731
           If that's
   what you want to call it.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.566
   It's how we're connected.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.769
  It's what gave us our gifts.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.455
Like it
or not,

19:00.456 --> 19:02.140
        You are an angel
    of the apocalypse, koa.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.142
Just like us.
No.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.644
          I'm not just like you.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.446
 For starters, i'm a buddhist.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.548
Well, faith comes in many forms.
                          I have

19:10.550 --> 19:13.317
   No faith in your mission.
                           Raul:
                      Seriously?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.819
      Why do we need her?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.722
I agree. How do we know
she's not connected to abaddon?

19:17.724 --> 19:19.790
What do you know about abaddon?

19:19.792 --> 19:22.793
      We think they're connected
           to the next horseman.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.662
         That's why we're trying
         to pinpoint the leader.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.664
 All i know is they're the ones
  who drained my bank account

19:26.666 --> 19:28.399
        A few days ago.
Rose:
So we're looking

19:28.401 --> 19:30.268
      For the same person.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.171
    We should work together.
      That is our purpose.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.506
                 Look, i already
                 have a purpose.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.375
            It's finding the guy
               who took my money

19:37.377 --> 19:38.910
                   And putting a
             bullet in his head.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.845
What if i told you we could help
    you get your money back?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.247
             Rose.
         I'm listening.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.184
     When we work together,
  we can be a powerful force.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.452
Work with us to find the leader
          of abaddon,

19:48.454 --> 19:51.422
 And i promise we will get you
       what you're after.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.424
              Koa:
 <i> Fine. But if any of you freaks</i>

19:53.426 --> 19:55.960
    <i> Get in my way, i'll take</i>
   <i> every last one of you out.</i>

19:55.962 --> 19:57.728
         What was that?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.497
Erin:
Raul,

19:59.499 --> 20:00.665
             Don't.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.667
        You really think
     you can mess with us?

20:04.837 --> 20:05.903
            (grunts)

20:07.740 --> 20:10.208
   I'd rather watch you kick
         your own ass.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.309
Rose:
Both of you,
stop it.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.510
We can get you
what you want,

20:12.512 --> 20:14.912
But you have
to work with us, koa.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.451
             Fine.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.387
I'll help the rest
of you find the hacker.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.323
But you?

20:25.325 --> 20:28.292
 You'd better stay the hell out
          of my face.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.297
I'm telling you,
koa can't be trusted.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.266
       Look, you might be right,

20:35.268 --> 20:37.735
But if she really is
the seventh messenger,
we might not have a choice.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.605
             Erin,
 you didn't hear her thoughts.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.440
         She's trouble.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.976
  Raul, will you just sit down
 and let me look at your hand?

20:46.779 --> 20:49.347
              Come on. Sit down.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.651
                      (sighs)

20:53.653 --> 20:56.654
     Just stay still, okay?
                        (groans)

21:09.502 --> 21:11.402
Feel
better?

21:41.467 --> 21:43.868
              ¶ ¶

21:48.341 --> 21:50.941
             Erin, are you okay?
What do you mean?

21:50.943 --> 21:53.811
        Oh. I...

21:53.813 --> 21:56.814
           I don't...
   I don't know what that is.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.816
  It was much smaller before.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.052
      It looks serious. Maybe we
     should get you to a doctor.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.355
          What if it's connected
                to your healing?

22:04.357 --> 22:07.024
       It could be.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.760
      I'm sure it's fine.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.699
                         Erin...
I should go check on amy.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.068
            (sighs)

22:22.575 --> 22:24.775
              Sir.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.111
   They're three klicks away.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.046
               Just crossed into
            the black zone, sir.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.449
                 Is the order to
                 take 'em alive?

22:31.451 --> 22:32.983
 She told me it didn't matter.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.454
       Targets obscured.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.788
          Let's move.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.994
          Are you sure
     this is the right way?

22:43.996 --> 22:45.863
          Yeah, well,
    it's what the map says.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.732
                     Yeah.
     Here, let me see that.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.867
           What, you don't think
       i know how to read a map?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.902
Hand it to me. You don't have
a good sense of direction.
        No, i can read.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.471
Hand it to me. Please.
    I have a very good sense
          of direction

22:53.473 --> 22:55.539
           (gunshot)
                     go, go, go,
                         go, go.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.576
           (gunshots)
         come on! Run!
   Someone's shooting at us!

23:05.651 --> 23:06.717
                        Oh, god.
                        Oh, god.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.121
    Where the hell are they?

23:24.837 --> 23:27.037
           (grunting)

23:28.474 --> 23:30.174
           (panting)

23:31.177 --> 23:32.576
             What?

23:32.578 --> 23:33.811
   It's in <i> the hunger games.</i>

23:33.813 --> 23:35.880
            Come on.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.550
     So the hacker's trying
      to recruit an army.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.752
Maybe the target is nero
and not the banks.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.554
                   Yeah, but the
                question is why.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.156
Well, maybe it's time
to pay nero a visit

23:45.158 --> 23:47.491
To figure out why they're
on abaddon's hit list.

23:47.493 --> 23:50.594
Well, the company's headquarters
is only a couple of hours away.
             Yeah.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.930
                 But security is
                   pretty tight.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.567
 How do you plan on getting in?

23:56.569 --> 24:00.571
  By helping you put that gift
     of yours to good use.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.181
     Hi there. I'm looking
     for accounts payable.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.615
          And you are?

24:11.617 --> 24:13.517
         The securities
    and exchange commission.

24:13.519 --> 24:14.618
                           Maybe
                       you've...

24:14.620 --> 24:16.454
          Heard of us.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.123
  Uh, the recent cyber attack
  brought some inconsistencies

24:19.125 --> 24:20.991
    To our attention, and...

24:20.993 --> 24:23.494
    I'm gonna need to review
   your financial statements.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.496
 Um, you're gonna want to speak
       with beth orchard.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.997
 She's the head of accounting.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.567
           Fantastic.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.779
                  (gasps)

24:41.781 --> 24:43.547
(chuckles)

24:43.549 --> 24:46.217
  You've been a very bad girl.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.519
           (chuckles)

24:48.521 --> 24:52.189
           (grunting)

24:52.191 --> 24:53.724
  You should have known better
         than to cheat.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.794
                 I need to teach
                   you a lesson.

24:56.796 --> 25:00.130
                     (chuckling)

25:02.235 --> 25:04.168
            (shouts)

25:04.170 --> 25:06.136
           (panting)

25:09.208 --> 25:12.142
                (groans)

25:12.144 --> 25:13.711
            (grunts)

25:15.248 --> 25:18.716
           (panting)

25:28.127 --> 25:30.861
        (elevator dings)

26:01.260 --> 26:03.594
  The computer logged me off.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.564
What's my password?
                   Uh, it's your
            daughter's birthday.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.999
       I just tried that.
       It's not working.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.074
 (keyboard keys clicking, beep)

26:17.076 --> 26:20.210
       (computer chimes)

26:20.212 --> 26:22.713
         Thanks, cara.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.282
         It's "car-ah."

26:25.284 --> 26:27.084
           Oh. Sorry.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.586
       Aah, three years,

26:28.588 --> 26:30.588
      And she still can't
         get it right.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.157
(keyboard keys clicking rapidly)

26:33.159 --> 26:34.692
Come on, vera.

26:34.694 --> 26:37.094
We got to stop and rest
at some point.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.763
            (sighs)

26:39.765 --> 26:42.766
                        (grunts)

26:42.768 --> 26:44.168
            (sighs)

26:44.170 --> 26:45.836
                  (sighs)

26:45.838 --> 26:47.838
             I'm sorry i brought
                    us out here.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.707
Man:
I'm not seeing them.
              Shh.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.745
I think we lost 'em, sir.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.280
Should we pack it in?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.349
Nate:
No. Then keep looking.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.952
      (crickets chirping)

27:01.954 --> 27:04.855
         (owl hooting,
         birds singing)

27:06.058 --> 27:08.993
        (crowd chatter)

27:08.995 --> 27:10.060
        Well?

27:10.062 --> 27:11.061
She found something.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.229
            What is it?
                            Koa:
                       According

27:12.231 --> 27:13.864
       To nero's records,

27:13.866 --> 27:15.065
   Their assets were drained
      in the bank attack.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.934
                  But not before
               every outstanding

27:16.936 --> 27:19.203
   Claim was paid to a small,
    nonprofit medical clinic

27:19.205 --> 27:20.738
      Called haven house.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.873
And they were all paid
in triplicate.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.375
   Haven house received more

27:24.377 --> 27:26.944
        Than $11 million
     overnight from europe.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.078
   That's some serious bank.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.346
 Why would an insurance company

27:29.348 --> 27:30.848
    Do something like that?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.683
Koa:
They wouldn't.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.151
       But abaddon would.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.853
Erin:
Wow. If that's true,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.688
      Haven house must be
        pretty important

27:37.690 --> 27:39.256
   For abaddon's leader to go
through all that trouble, right?

27:39.258 --> 27:41.725
  Yeah. Let's go find out why.

27:41.727 --> 27:44.228
     Is that what i think it is?

27:44.230 --> 27:46.830
Yeah, it's the sliver
of the meteorite.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.432
I took it from the mass spec

27:48.434 --> 27:51.001
After the rest
of the sample was stolen.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.703
Safekeeping, i guess.

27:52.705 --> 27:55.005
                  Good thinking.
Yeah.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.007
(sniffles)

27:57.009 --> 27:59.710
(quivering breathing)

27:59.712 --> 28:02.846
                      Come here.
                You're freezing.

28:02.848 --> 28:06.216
            Thanks.

28:06.218 --> 28:09.920
         (bird hooting,
       crickets chirping)

28:09.922 --> 28:13.757
        (siren blaring,
         horns honking)

28:21.233 --> 28:24.101
               They say money is
           the root of all evil.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.204
                        (laughs)

28:27.206 --> 28:29.440
 You. You were there that night

28:29.442 --> 28:31.241
          In hong kong
      when my bank account

28:31.243 --> 28:32.943
Got hacked.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.278
What are you doing here?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.080
                I'm usually more
             discreet than this,

28:36.082 --> 28:38.849
       But i know when it's best
           to just show my hand.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.751
                      After all,

28:40.753 --> 28:42.319
      You can't con a con.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.755
     Who the hell are you?

28:44.757 --> 28:46.490
     Who the hell am i? (laughs)

28:46.492 --> 28:49.259
         People know me
    by many different names.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.328
Okay.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.896
        I'll play along.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.998
                Good, 'cause i'm
                   dying to ask.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.067
    Why would a sharp-witted
     professional like you

28:57.069 --> 28:59.369
     Mess around with rose
  and that group of amateurs?

28:59.371 --> 29:01.972
         I work alone.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.174
      I'm just using them
      to get what i want.

29:04.176 --> 29:07.377
                       I can get
                 your money back

29:07.379 --> 29:09.847
                  And then some.

29:09.849 --> 29:13.884
     And i won't judge you
         like they do.

29:13.886 --> 29:17.287
         Like i said...
         I work alone.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.857
         Suit yourself,
       but remember, koa.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.228
 Opportunity only knocks once.

29:25.397 --> 29:28.465
        (siren blaring)

29:40.412 --> 29:42.479
  (helicopter blades whirring)

29:44.884 --> 29:47.251
        (birds singing)

29:52.291 --> 29:54.424
Hey?
              Hmm?

29:54.426 --> 29:56.794
         You hear that?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.495
  (helicopter blades whirring)

30:07.072 --> 30:09.506
                   Give me that.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.248
 (loud whirring of helicopter)

30:18.250 --> 30:20.250
                           Alan:
                           Whoa.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.019
It's definitely not a campsite.

30:27.827 --> 30:29.359
        (crowd chatter)

30:29.361 --> 30:30.961
 Somebody here has got to know

30:30.963 --> 30:32.863
      Why all those claims
       were paid by nero

30:32.865 --> 30:34.932
  And how abaddon's connected
          to all this.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.333
     Let's split up and try
          to find out.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.038
                  Hi.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.978
       You got to admit,
she came through for us at nero.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.880
          Doesn't mean
      i have to trust her.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.281
    I hope she'll understand

30:51.283 --> 30:53.884
         The importance
  of her destiny soon enough.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.456
            (sighs)

31:11.036 --> 31:13.237
Here you go, buddy.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.340
                         Thanks.
  I hope you feel better soon,
             okay?

31:16.342 --> 31:17.941
             Okay.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.650
                  Hey. Hey, hey.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.652
                   Are you okay?
Yeah, i'm fine.

31:28.654 --> 31:31.288
    I just got a little bit
    lightheaded, that's all.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.557
              Tell me you didn't
             just heal that kid.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.193
        What can i say?
         I'm a mother.

31:52.478 --> 31:56.313
   That's an abaddon laptop.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.454
I don't know
how much closer we can get.

32:06.659 --> 32:09.059
  (man shouting indistinctly)

32:13.198 --> 32:14.698
Well, if it isn't g.I. Joe.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.199
It's captain barton.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.068
                He kicked us out
                  of the crater,

32:18.070 --> 32:20.537
Then covered it all up. What do
  you suppose he's doing here?

32:20.539 --> 32:23.140
 I don't know, but this is our
 chance. We have to follow him.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.075
No. Are you crazy?

32:25.077 --> 32:27.077
We'll never get past security.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.679
Remember the dudes who tried
to kill us yesterday?

32:28.681 --> 32:30.614
We got to get out of here, v.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.215
  Alan, you know how i've died

32:32.217 --> 32:34.351
     And come back to life
     a few times recently?

32:34.353 --> 32:36.620
Yeah, kind of rings a bell.
             Turns out it's this
            thing that i can do.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.089
What-what are
you talking about?
                     It's called
                 spirit-walking.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.091
What?!
  I don't want you to freak out.
   I promise i'll be right back.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.093
                           Okay?
No, no. What are you...?
No, no.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.494
           (panting)

32:44.496 --> 32:46.096
               V?

32:46.098 --> 32:47.731
(panting)

32:47.733 --> 32:49.299
V?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.468
                         Hey, v.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.205
          (whooshing)

32:55.207 --> 32:56.740
      (indistinct chatter)

32:56.742 --> 32:59.309
       Thank you so much
        for helping us.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.011
I just can't believe

33:01.013 --> 33:02.546
Mrs. Schiller would ever have
anything to do with drugs.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.048
                 It's an ongoing
                  investigation,

33:05.050 --> 33:07.317
So anything that you can tell us
        about this woman

33:07.319 --> 33:09.586
   Or young man in the photo
 would be greatly appreciated.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.989
    Well...

33:11.991 --> 33:13.290
     Her name is margaret.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.992
       She had leukemia.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.526
She came to us about a year ago

33:16.528 --> 33:18.395
  After nero health repeatedly
       denied her claims

33:18.397 --> 33:20.130
 For a bone marrow transplant.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.531
     What happened to her?

33:21.533 --> 33:23.567
Well, we did everything
we could for her, but

33:23.569 --> 33:25.669
    Without that transplant,
 she didn't have many options.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.271
After nero health denied
her claim for the final time,

33:28.273 --> 33:30.007
     Her son leland decided
       he'd take her home

33:30.009 --> 33:31.308
 And take care of her himself.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.410
   What else can you tell us
           about him?

33:33.412 --> 33:36.613
    Oh, he was a quiet boy.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.181
      He seemed troubled.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.750
    How so?

33:39.752 --> 33:41.752
Well, i mean,
not that i blame him,

33:41.754 --> 33:43.420
But he was just so angry at nero

33:43.422 --> 33:46.023
Over the way
they treated his mother.

33:46.025 --> 33:49.326
Now, i don't want
to give you the wrong idea.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.595
  Leland could be really sweet
     when he wanted to be.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.497
He helped us out a couple
of times around here

33:53.499 --> 33:55.298
 When our computers went down.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.300
 You wouldn't believe how handy
    he is with those things.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.102
      Oh, i bet we would.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.071
       Thank you, ma'am.

34:01.073 --> 34:04.141
        Thank you.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.709
You thinking what i'm thinking?

34:05.711 --> 34:08.045
 Leland schiller is the leader
          of abaddon.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.713
Aka the horseman of pestilence.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.281
  What kind of sin is he about
           to commit?

34:13.085 --> 34:14.717
            (gasps)

34:14.719 --> 34:17.487
   (people chatting, gasping)

34:26.165 --> 34:28.065
                  This is pretty
            serious, ms. Calder.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.167
      Your blood pressure's very
  low, which is why you fainted.

34:30.168 --> 34:34.404
  I want to run some more tests,
  but i will say that a hematoma

34:34.406 --> 34:36.505
            That size should not
          just appear overnight.

34:36.507 --> 34:40.077
I probably just
bumped into something

34:40.079 --> 34:42.478
Without realizing it,
that's all.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.246
    You need to be admitted
         to a hospital.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.549
                   This could be
              serious, and until

34:45.551 --> 34:47.184
                   We figure out
                what's going on,

34:47.186 --> 34:50.120
           I want you monitored.
         I can have an ambulance

34:50.121 --> 34:51.588
          Transfer you
 to the nearest cardiology lab

34:51.590 --> 34:53.356
   If you don't have someone
       who can drive you.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.425
    I do.
                       Okay, but

34:55.427 --> 34:56.827
               Don't wait, erin.

34:56.829 --> 35:00.130
             You need to go now.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.867
          (door opens)

35:03.869 --> 35:05.802
         (door closes)

35:05.804 --> 35:09.539
     (indistinct shouting)

35:09.541 --> 35:12.109
  (garbled radio transmission)

35:13.445 --> 35:16.580
      "operation genesis."

35:16.582 --> 35:19.583
                 Captain barton,

35:19.585 --> 35:21.618
            We almost done here?
Yes, ma'am.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.220
                     Oh, my god,
                  it's richards.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.589
      The horseman of war.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.524
What the hell is she doing here?

35:35.200 --> 35:35.832
                  Oh, ma'am. Oh.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.334
Um, i'm sorry.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.802
I... Just...

35:48.747 --> 35:50.647
                      Hey.
              Hi.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.648
         Are you okay?

35:51.650 --> 35:52.883
             Yeah.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.518
    Is this because you...?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.520
     I think so, but, hey,

35:56.522 --> 35:59.489
  If i have the power to heal,
 i might as well use it, right?

35:59.491 --> 36:01.658
Not if it's gonna make you sick.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.227
I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.535
What? What is it?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.472
                    Where's koa?

36:15.474 --> 36:17.874
        (birds singing)

36:20.279 --> 36:21.645
                         Driver:
                       Where to?

36:21.647 --> 36:23.513
       3245 tucker road.

36:25.551 --> 36:28.385
       (engine starting)

36:33.458 --> 36:35.492
I don't like this, vera.

36:35.494 --> 36:40.597
 Hey, bring your ass back to me
           right now.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.632
      (mechanical rattling
          and humming)

36:43.902 --> 36:45.969
           (thudding)

36:45.971 --> 36:49.673
 I trust you'll clean the site?

36:49.675 --> 36:51.441
       Operation genesis

36:51.443 --> 36:54.244
    Is a defense department
    special weapons op now.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.614
                     Understood?
Yes, ma'am.

37:05.891 --> 37:06.957
                       (panting)

37:06.959 --> 37:10.227
          (whooshing)

37:15.667 --> 37:17.567
         (gasps loudly)

37:17.569 --> 37:19.236
                     Oh, my god.

37:19.238 --> 37:20.770
       (gasping for air)

37:20.772 --> 37:22.906
You came back.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.375
Did you hear the gunshots?
     (truck engine revving)

37:27.512 --> 37:28.845
             Worse.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.880
      I saw what happened.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.684
            I'm telling you, koa
     shape-shifted into a nurse,

37:34.686 --> 37:37.454
              And she stole mrs.
        Schiller's medical file.
He's right.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.457
  And the nurses' station said
    it was their only copy.
                   That's great.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.792
  So, koa has all the personal
info that she needs. She's gonna

37:42.794 --> 37:45.328
  Track down leland schiller and
try to put a bullet in his head.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.997
             I knew we shouldn't
               have trusted her.
You ever stop to think

37:46.999 --> 37:49.332
 Maybe she ran off because you
   didn't give her a chance?

37:49.334 --> 37:51.868
            Joshua:
 Okay, guys, look, either way,
     she got a head start.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.471
She can lead him to breaking his
seal without even realizing it.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.873
 All senator richards had to do
      was raise her glass.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.308
                           Erin:
                    We only have

37:58.310 --> 38:00.277
         Two hours left
      on abaddon's clock.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.746
         How do we know
what leland's sin's going to be?

38:02.748 --> 38:05.649
Horseman of pestilence. Given
abaddon's track record and

38:05.651 --> 38:07.050
    Leland's hacker skills,

38:07.052 --> 38:08.485
         I'd put money
on some sort of computer virus.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.953
Then nero has to be the target.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.355
