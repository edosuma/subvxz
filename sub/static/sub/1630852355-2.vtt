17:51.203 --> 17:52.738
Run for it, boy!

17:52.738 --> 17:56.275
Come, now. Let's put on...
a happy face.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.711
‐Tilly?
‐Sister, no!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.913
‐[both grunt]
‐[Cricket groans]

18:00.913 --> 18:03.783
What's going <i>oooon?!</i>

18:03.783 --> 18:07.320
Oh, no. What <i>is</i> all this?!

18:07.320 --> 18:08.754
Good to see
you're up and at 'em.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.656
Dad, you've gone
cuckoo bananas!

18:10.656 --> 18:12.425
What'd you do to my house?!

18:12.425 --> 18:14.627
My friends, why do you resist?

18:14.627 --> 18:15.995
I'm trying to help you.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.863
Help?! Forcing us to act happy

18:17.863 --> 18:19.465
all the time ain't helpin'!

18:19.465 --> 18:22.735
‐It's nutty!
‐You just don't understand.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.437
We're simply banishing
the bad feelings

18:24.437 --> 18:26.072
to make room
for the good ones!

18:26.072 --> 18:28.174
Try all you like,
you'll never‐‐

18:28.174 --> 18:30.109
‐[both straining]
‐That's better.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.844
You'll never break us!

18:31.844 --> 18:34.947
‐Complainers forever!
‐[sighs] So misguided.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.316
I guess y'all have given me
no choice. Tilly?

18:37.316 --> 18:39.819
What‐what!

18:39.819 --> 18:41.454
[male voice]
<i>Welcome to Side A.</i>

18:41.454 --> 18:43.289
<i>To eliminate</i>
<i>negative feelings,</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:45.825
<i>simply replace them</i>
<i>with positive ones.</i>

18:45.825 --> 18:47.560
<i>Join me for</i>
<i>the next four hours</i>

18:47.560 --> 18:50.029
‐ <i>as we Live, Laugh, Love.</i>
‐[both struggling]

18:50.029 --> 18:52.531
‐ Live, Laugh, Love.
‐Live, Laugh, Love.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.800
‐ <i>Live, Laugh, Love.</i>
‐Live, Laugh, Love.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.269
‐ <i>Live, Laugh, Love.</i>
‐[both] Live, Laugh, Love.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.506
[both] Why think bad thoughts?
Why whimper and huff?

19:00.506 --> 19:03.275
Why can't you just
Live, Laugh, and Love?!

19:03.275 --> 19:06.612
‐Live, Laugh, Love!
‐[both screaming]

19:06.612 --> 19:09.382
[humming] Hey, Till!

19:09.382 --> 19:11.450
Can you pass me
another basket? Mine's full.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.985
I don't seem to have a spare!

19:12.985 --> 19:14.887
Perhaps Gramma
and Cricket have one!

19:14.887 --> 19:16.555
Hey, family!

19:16.555 --> 19:20.693
Why I'd live, laugh, love
to give you one of my baskets.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.562
Dearest father,
take one of mine, as well.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.264
Well, thank you!
It's great to see

19:25.264 --> 19:27.166
such happy, positive attitudes!

19:27.166 --> 19:30.403
I was so wrong before.
Now I love smiling,

19:30.403 --> 19:34.306
being helpful, and picking
berries all day long.

19:34.306 --> 19:37.877
Aah. I seem to have stabbed
my hand with yet more thorns.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.546
[weak laugh] Maybe if
I try one more‐‐

19:40.546 --> 19:42.381
No. Ha‐ha...

19:42.381 --> 19:45.284
Witness me, father.
My little child arms

19:45.284 --> 19:47.787
may be crispy and burnt,
but I love it.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.389
Yes. That's the spirit?

19:50.389 --> 19:52.525
[both]
Live, Laugh, Love!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.727
‐Hmm...
‐Isn't it great, Papa?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.362
They're so much happier now!

19:56.362 --> 19:59.298
Well, they have
stopped complainin'.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.534
So... everything
should be fine now!

20:01.534 --> 20:03.269
Except, it's not fine!

20:03.269 --> 20:04.870
[both babbling]

20:04.870 --> 20:07.373
This whole thing... stinks!

20:07.373 --> 20:08.941
‐[gasps]
‐[both] Wha‐‐?

20:08.941 --> 20:12.611
‐Uh...
‐Papa, was that... negativity?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.380
[stammering]

20:14.380 --> 20:17.216
But Papa, how could you
openly defy our mission

20:17.216 --> 20:19.452
to Live, Laugh, Love?

20:19.452 --> 20:23.122
[whimpering] Because...
it's impossible!

20:23.122 --> 20:25.491
[grunting, screaming]

20:28.427 --> 20:31.430
[panting]

20:36.068 --> 20:38.104
‐[sighs]
‐Bill?

20:38.104 --> 20:40.406
Is this... a test?

20:40.406 --> 20:44.477
No. I just... wanted you
to look at life like I do.

20:44.477 --> 20:48.080
But maybe it isn't good to
force positivity all the time.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.651
The blackberry harvest stinks.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.687
Cricket, you're...
you're right.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.989
The thorns, the sun...

20:56.989 --> 21:00.593
Uh, don't get me started
on that incessant supernova.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.528
Ugh! And those
back‐breakin' baskets.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.997
Who knew berries
could be so heavy?

21:04.997 --> 21:07.433
Hey, I actually feel better!

21:07.433 --> 21:08.734
I'm not a big fan
of complainin',

21:08.734 --> 21:10.503
but I see now
that bein' honest

21:10.503 --> 21:12.104
about what you feel
is healthy.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.807
What do you say we
finish the harvest honestly?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.308
‐Hooray!
‐Yeah!

21:16.308 --> 21:18.677
‐[all grumbling]
