unsightly rolls...</i>

00:06.162 --> 00:09.531
<i>Oh, that unattractive austere diet...</i>

00:09.532 --> 00:12.901
Oh-ho-ho those stubborn thighs.

<i>Say goodbye to ugly fat! Say...</i>

Johnny: David? Can you come here please?

TV infomercial: ...Exercise
miracle you've ever seen!

00:25.848 --> 00:28.416
David, can you come in here please?!

00:28.417 --> 00:29.785
<i>David: What?</i>

00:29.786 --> 00:31.386
Well, come in here and I'll tell you.

00:31.387 --> 00:33.116
<i>- David: Well, why don't you just tell
me from there?</i> - <i>Johnny: David...</i>

00:33.117 --> 00:35.323
<i>- David: You could've already told me.</i>
- I want to speak face to face.

00:35.324 --> 00:38.126
<i>Motels this size we're
basically always face to face.</i>

00:38.127 --> 00:39.861
In the same room.

00:39.862 --> 00:43.965
David: Why are you yelling?
I'm right here.

00:43.966 --> 00:45.934
I want you to move your clothes.

00:45.935 --> 00:48.203
- David: I did.
- Johnny: Out of my closet.

00:48.204 --> 00:50.505
You've got t-shirts on hangers.

00:50.506 --> 00:53.275
I've nowhere to hang my clothes.

00:53.276 --> 00:55.977
<i>Well, put them over the t-shirts then.</i>

00:55.978 --> 00:57.445
- Johnny: (Sighs) Moira...
- Moira: Alexis!

00:57.446 --> 00:58.947
No, no, it's David I want.

00:58.948 --> 01:00.785
I need to speak with our daughter.

01:00.786 --> 01:02.951
Johnny: Good luck.

01:02.952 --> 01:04.653
(Loud) Oh my God! Where
did you hear that?!

01:04.654 --> 01:06.621

01:06.622 --> 01:08.156
Alexis: Yeah? What is it?

01:08.157 --> 01:09.883
<i>Moira: I need you to
fill this out please.</i>

01:09.884 --> 01:11.026
Alexis: Fill what out?

01:11.027 --> 01:13.628
Your community service papers.

01:13.629 --> 01:16.236
As our only delinquent, I hope
it's not asking too much.

01:16.237 --> 01:17.365
I still have to do that?

01:17.366 --> 01:19.334
Generally, that's how it works, honey.

01:19.335 --> 01:22.003
When you break the law, you've
gotta serve your sentence.

01:22.004 --> 01:23.570
Well, it was one DUI.

01:23.571 --> 01:25.738
Please, before I lose my mind.

01:25.739 --> 01:27.707
(Sighs)

01:27.708 --> 01:30.910
(Pages flap)

01:30.911 --> 01:32.712
I don't get it. It's all done.

01:32.713 --> 01:37.383
No, there's still a little bit
that needs to be filled in.

01:37.384 --> 01:39.385
Um... all that's missing
is my middle name.

01:39.386 --> 01:41.054
Then fill it in please.

01:41.055 --> 01:43.556
Do I have to do that?

01:43.557 --> 01:47.527
Why must you be so constantly irksome?

01:47.528 --> 01:50.396
Do you not know my middle name?

01:50.397 --> 01:53.900
Of course I do. I blessed you with it.

01:53.901 --> 01:57.170
Okay, so um... then what
name should I put down then?

01:57.171 --> 01:58.972
Alexis, do as your mother says, please.

01:58.973 --> 02:01.608
Do you know my middle?

02:01.609 --> 02:03.409
If I said, "Anna-"

02:03.410 --> 02:05.578
I can't believe this.

02:05.579 --> 02:10.049
<i>- Moira:
- Alexis... something rose.</i>

02:10.050 --> 02:13.553
We have so many disasters
bombarding us right now, my dear,

02:13.554 --> 02:15.421
the middle name of an ungrateful child

02:15.422 --> 02:17.724
is hardly a priority.

02:17.725 --> 02:19.792
David: Wait. Alexis has a middle name?

02:19.793 --> 02:21.461
Why is this the first
time hearing of this?

02:21.462 --> 02:23.296
Do... do I have a middle name?

02:23.297 --> 02:25.331
Johnny: Now you come into the room.

Moira: Have we failed them, John?
I'm worried about our children.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.844
Are we terrible parents?

02:37.845 --> 02:41.247
Terrible parents?!

02:41.248 --> 02:43.383
We sent them to the
best boarding schools,

02:43.384 --> 02:46.953
we hired the best nannies...
We did everything right.

02:48.822 --> 02:50.857
I mean, they're not overly
affectionate with us

02:50.858 --> 02:53.660
and, uh, there's a lot more
disrespect than I'd like,

02:53.661 --> 02:55.370
but, uh, no, we're good parents.

02:55.371 --> 02:57.683
But who are they?

02:59.033 --> 03:01.801
Well, it might be nice to get
to know them better, I suppose.

03:01.802 --> 03:04.137
Wouldn't it, John?

03:04.138 --> 03:06.105
But who has time amidst all this chaos?

03:06.106 --> 03:08.294
Mm. I get it.

03:08.942 --> 03:12.478
(Birds chirp)

03:12.479 --> 03:14.781
So what's your deal? You're pretty.

03:14.782 --> 03:16.582
What's that like?

03:16.583 --> 03:19.152
Alexis: Um... it's good.

03:19.153 --> 03:22.188
Yeah, lots of doors open
up for pretty people.

03:22.189 --> 03:26.125
Mm-hmm, clearly, as I register
for community service.

03:26.126 --> 03:27.727
So what'd you do?

03:27.728 --> 03:32.198
Um... I drove into the Prada
Store on Rodeo Drive.

03:32.199 --> 03:33.666
In fairness, it did look a lot like,

03:33.667 --> 03:35.401
um, the entrance to a parking garage.

03:35.402 --> 03:36.903
Uh-huh.

03:36.904 --> 03:38.438
And I was high at the time.

03:38.439 --> 03:40.373
Are you high right now?

03:40.374 --> 03:42.709
No, I'm not.

03:42.710 --> 03:45.011
Well, you might wanna be,

03:45.012 --> 03:47.880
'cause this isn't exactly thrilling work.

03:47.881 --> 03:50.274
And you won't be gettin' any
chit chat from your buddy.

03:50.275 --> 03:51.818
(Sighs) What buddy?

03:51.819 --> 03:54.187
Ronnie: You're not the
only druggy in town, Hun?

03:54.188 --> 03:56.422
- Mutt: Ronnie.
- Ronnie: Mm.

03:59.126 --> 04:00.760
(Loud clunk) Here's your garbage stick.

04:00.761 --> 04:03.096
You use it to pick up garbage.

04:03.097 --> 04:05.264
And here...

04:05.265 --> 04:07.200
Oh no, I'm fine.

04:07.201 --> 04:09.168
Thank you, that's very sweet.

04:09.169 --> 04:11.760
Ronnie: This isn't say yes
to the dress, princess.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.107
Orange is the new orange.

Alexis: 'Kay.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.282
David: Who needs 14 Grey suits?

04:23.283 --> 04:25.118
What am I supposed to do
with my dry clean onlys?!

04:25.119 --> 04:26.527
Stevie: I'm still trying to figure out

04:26.528 --> 04:28.321
why you'd own more than
one piece of clothing

04:28.322 --> 04:30.056
you can't put in a washing machine.

04:30.057 --> 04:32.122
You try putting a cashmere
sweater in the washing machine.

04:32.123 --> 04:33.459
It'll bite your wrist.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.561
That's a problem I'd like to have.

04:37.598 --> 04:38.931
Are these all your clothes?

04:38.932 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.001 --> 04:43.636
What's this, then?

04:43.637 --> 04:46.372
That's a sweater.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.508
It's one chromosome away
from a crocheted blanket.

04:48.509 --> 04:51.043
What?

04:51.044 --> 04:53.546
It's... just your clothes,
they're all kind of funky.

04:53.547 --> 04:55.548
Funky?

04:55.549 --> 04:57.450
Yeah. Funky.

04:57.451 --> 04:59.155
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm just trying to figure out...

04:59.156 --> 05:00.953
What about this...
What about this is funky?

05:00.954 --> 05:03.022
I'm just having a hard time understanding.

05:03.023 --> 05:07.203
It's just, you know,
like funky. Different.

05:07.528 --> 05:09.362
Yeah, funky is a neon t-shirt

05:09.363 --> 05:10.952
you buy at an airport gift shop,

05:10.953 --> 05:12.438
next to a bejeweled iPhone case.

05:12.439 --> 05:16.630
This... this... is luxury.

05:16.870 --> 05:18.738
There's a lot of stuff here.

05:18.739 --> 05:21.674
Have you ever considered
selling some of this.

05:21.675 --> 05:24.076
These are my things.

05:24.077 --> 05:25.832
I've hand-selected each of these things;

05:25.833 --> 05:27.652
they mean a lot to me.

05:28.649 --> 05:30.633
How much do you think
I can get for this?

05:31.318 --> 05:32.785
(Birds chirp)

05:35.289 --> 05:37.056
<i>Alexis: So you got busted
for selling drugs?</i>

05:37.057 --> 05:39.125
Like hard drugs? Like...

05:39.126 --> 05:43.563
Did you wear a Hazmat suit and...
work in a trailer?

05:43.564 --> 05:46.165
No. It was just weed
and mushrooms, uppers.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.100
Mostly to truckers and
my high school teachers.

05:48.101 --> 05:51.471
Mm-hmm. It's actually
pretty clean around here,

05:51.472 --> 05:55.441
which is shocking considering
the state of our motel room.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.311
Speaking of unfit homes,
why do you live in a barn?

05:58.312 --> 06:00.179
What's wrong with living in a barn?

06:00.180 --> 06:02.148
Mm... nothing, if you're a goat.

06:02.149 --> 06:03.983
(Chuckles)

06:03.984 --> 06:05.485
Mutt: Well, it serves its purpose.

06:05.486 --> 06:07.953
It seems to... With the ladies.

06:09.690 --> 06:11.457
That's just a joke.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.793
I'm sorry for walking in on
you and Twyla the other day.

06:13.794 --> 06:15.995
Mutt: No, it's cool.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.964
Alexis: So how long have
you two been together-

06:17.965 --> 06:20.433
Mutt: So, listen, I gotta
take off for a bit.

06:20.434 --> 06:22.802
I got this thing I gotta do.
Can you cover for me?

06:22.803 --> 06:24.649
- Alexis: Um... I mean...
- Mutt: Cool.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.757
- Alexis: Yeah.
- Mutt: Thanks. Sorry.

06:28.542 --> 06:32.586
Excuse me! What am I
supposed to keep doing here?

06:33.747 --> 06:35.681
I feel like we should break
these into categories.

06:35.682 --> 06:40.887
Um... fit, fabric,

06:40.888 --> 06:43.823
and nationality.

06:43.824 --> 06:45.925
Stevie: Or we could do this.

06:45.926 --> 06:47.326
<i>David: I... um...</i>

06:47.327 --> 06:49.161
- Stevie: Keep or sell?
- David: Well, those are-

06:49.162 --> 06:50.429
- Stevie: Keep or sell.
- David: Uh...

06:50.430 --> 06:53.599
- Stevie: Just keep or sell.
- David: Sell. Sell them.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.501
I got these at a showroom in Paris.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.456
Stevie: I got these on
clearance rack at Target.

06:57.457 --> 06:59.338
- David: $850.
- Stevie: 850 what?

06:59.339 --> 07:01.007
- David: Eight hundred-
- Stevie: Dollars?!

07:01.008 --> 07:02.975
- David: $850 dollars.
- Stevie: $850 dollars?

07:02.976 --> 07:05.945
These are a collector's. There's a woman
in Paris that makes them by hand, so...

07:05.946 --> 07:08.581
My car's worth less than your pants.

07:08.582 --> 07:11.250
Well, I've seen your car and
that makes sense to me.

07:11.251 --> 07:12.718
(Clears throat)

07:12.719 --> 07:14.186
Stevie: Okay then. Right.

07:14.187 --> 07:18.821
We'll try to get $850
dollars for your pants.

07:19.793 --> 07:21.761
Keep or sell?

07:21.762 --> 07:23.763
I don't know.

grunts and groans)

07:56.196 --> 07:59.031
(Music plays quietly)

07:59.032 --> 08:02.363
You know, I think the reason
our kids are so casual with us

08:02.364 --> 08:05.533
is because they think
of us as their friends.

08:05.534 --> 08:08.036
Hmm, no.

08:08.037 --> 08:11.305
Johnny: No, it's obvious.
It's obvious, Moira, right?

08:11.306 --> 08:13.775
Because we're hip parents.

08:13.776 --> 08:15.592
- Moira: Oh, John...
- Johnny: And that comes at a price.

08:15.593 --> 08:16.978
John, we're not hip.

08:16.979 --> 08:19.480
I'm hipper than you but
in our childrens' eyes

08:19.481 --> 08:22.583
we are the polar antonym of hip.

08:22.584 --> 08:25.853
Well, somehow we've lost
touch with our kids.

08:25.854 --> 08:27.655
We've become complete strangers.

08:27.656 --> 08:30.258
Twyla: Hey! Have we decided?

08:30.259 --> 08:32.493
Just coffee, please.

08:32.494 --> 08:35.863
Johnny: Uh... Twyla, do you
get along with your parents?

08:35.864 --> 08:37.331
<i>Twyla: I did.</i>

08:37.332 --> 08:39.600
It's a little different now.

08:39.601 --> 08:42.570
My mom has this thing where half the
time she thinks I'm her cousin Angela.

08:42.571 --> 08:44.472
<i>And it's getting harder and harder</i>

08:44.473 --> 08:47.455
to coordinate visitation
times with my dad in prison.

08:48.410 --> 08:50.244
I'm sorry I asked.

08:50.245 --> 08:52.680
Twyla: Oh, that's okay!
I'll get you your coffees.

08:52.681 --> 08:54.573
(Diners murmur quietly, cutlery clanks)

08:56.485 --> 08:58.886
<i>(Cars rumble by the motel)</i>

08:58.887 --> 09:00.300
<i>Johnny: Your mother and
I have been talking</i>

09:00.301 --> 09:02.123
and we've come to the realization

09:02.124 --> 09:04.358
that we've not been very good parents.

09:04.359 --> 09:07.528
<i>Moira: Sadly, and most of the time,</i>

09:07.529 --> 09:10.331
we have no interest in
what's going on with you.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.433
Johnny: We have no idea what.
'Cause she means no idea.

09:12.434 --> 09:13.901
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

09:13.902 --> 09:16.737
<i>We have lost touch as a family</i>

09:16.738 --> 09:18.873
and if we're gonna get through
this ordeal together,

09:18.874 --> 09:22.376
we have got to get reacquainted.

09:22.377 --> 09:26.080
Now, back at Rose Video,
we had management retreats

09:26.081 --> 09:28.449
where we would play fun
team-building exercises-

09:28.450 --> 09:30.017
David: You also had
company-wide spa days.

09:30.018 --> 09:32.653
Why don't we try that?

09:32.654 --> 09:36.057
Johnny: And one of the ice
breakers at these retreats

09:36.058 --> 09:38.626
was a game that was always a hit.

09:38.627 --> 09:40.061
And it was a game where somebody

09:40.062 --> 09:41.729
would tell a lie about themselves,

09:41.730 --> 09:44.165
and then a truth, and then another lie,

09:44.166 --> 09:46.934
and everybody would have to
guess which one was the lie.

09:46.935 --> 09:49.003
No, Johnny, they had to guess
which one was the truth.

09:49.004 --> 09:50.605
Mm... which one was the lie.

09:50.606 --> 09:52.173
David: It's just-it's just one lie.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.841
- Johnny: What did I say?
- Alexis: You said two lies.

09:53.842 --> 09:54.942
- Johnny: Well, it is two lies.
- Alexis: No, it's-

09:54.943 --> 09:56.277
David: No, the game is
"two truths and a lie."

09:56.278 --> 09:57.512
- Johnny: It's truth.
- David: That's the game.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.264
Johnny: So you've heard of it.
You've heard of it.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.914
Alexis: Well, yeah, because babies
play that at their birthday parties.

09:59.915 --> 10:02.049
Johnny: Okay, whatever.
It's a good game.

10:02.050 --> 10:05.086
Okay? Now, here's how it goes.
I'll give you an example.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.854
David: Why don't I start?
Um, I'm miserable,

10:06.855 --> 10:09.223
drunk, and hate this game.

10:09.224 --> 10:13.995
So... here's a hint...
Sadly, I'm not drunk.

10:13.996 --> 10:15.897
Okay, wrong attitude. That's
the wrong-right off the top!

10:15.898 --> 10:18.266
Alexis: Okay, my turn, my turn, my turn.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.235
Um... okay. My eyes are brown,

10:21.236 --> 10:23.571
<i>I am basically sample-sized,</i>

10:23.572 --> 10:28.075
and one time I escaped from a
Thai drug lord's car trunk

10:28.076 --> 10:31.612
by bribing him with sex.

10:31.613 --> 10:33.681
Right idea, honey, but you know what?

10:33.682 --> 10:35.795
It's gotta be more
challenging for everybody-

10:35.796 --> 10:38.719
Her eyes are aqua.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.855
Johnny: You did what?

10:40.856 --> 10:43.724
Alexis: (Laughs) I'm kidding!

10:43.725 --> 10:46.327
I clearly would never
bribe anybody with sex.

10:46.328 --> 10:47.695
Johnny: When were you in Thailand?!

10:47.696 --> 10:49.597
I told you that I was
on spring break.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.966
Everyone can just calm down

10:51.967 --> 10:53.801
because Aroon was a lovely gentleman

10:53.802 --> 10:56.070
until he ran out of money.

10:56.071 --> 10:57.905
How many people do you know

10:57.906 --> 11:00.208
that are currently in the prison system?

11:00.209 --> 11:02.376
- Is it like twelve...?
- Um, I'm pretty sure just two.

11:02.377 --> 11:03.811
Johnny: All right, that's enough.
Good game.

11:03.812 --> 11:05.980
Good game, everybody!
Alexis you're grounded.

11:05.981 --> 11:07.515
No! That was ten years ago,

11:07.516 --> 11:09.445
and everybody does dumb
stuff in high school.

11:09.446 --> 11:10.785
Johnny: You were 17?!

11:10.786 --> 11:12.019
Did you know this?

11:12.020 --> 11:14.956
As if. I don't do girl talk.

11:14.957 --> 11:17.058
<i>Alexis: Okay, everybody
does dumb stuff everywhere.</i>

11:17.059 --> 11:19.560
For example, I saw Mutt today -

11:19.561 --> 11:21.095
the guy that lives in the barn -

11:21.096 --> 11:24.432
making out... with the mayor's wife.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.833
- Moira: What's-her-face?!
- Mm-hmm.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.034
And the homeless kid?

11:27.035 --> 11:31.472
Mm-hmm. Guys like that will bone anything.

11:31.473 --> 11:35.142
- Well, not anything.
- Stop.

11:35.143 --> 11:37.445
- 'Cause that would mean...
- Stop. Stop.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.613
- That would include...
- Stop it.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.677
- You. Which it doesn't.
- Don't.

11:39.678 --> 11:41.678
Ew.

11:45.948 --> 11:48.149
Johnny: You know, I remember when Alexis

11:48.150 --> 11:50.785
was just a chubby-faced little girl

11:50.786 --> 11:53.821
racing around the house in
that banned babywalker,

11:53.822 --> 11:55.990
and now she's spending time...

11:55.991 --> 11:58.292
(Inhales deeply) In a drug lord's trunk?!

11:58.293 --> 12:02.163
Twyla: Oh, that is my
favourite Liam Neeson movie.

12:02.164 --> 12:04.699
Moira: Johnny. Johnny,
look who's come in.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.067
(Low hum of chatter)

12:07.870 --> 12:10.004
Is it true?

12:10.005 --> 12:13.241
Politician's neglected wife
sleeps with a ranch hand.

12:13.242 --> 12:15.122
- Moira: I love it.
- Johnny: He's not a ranch hand.

12:15.123 --> 12:16.323
He's a vagrant in a barn.

12:18.547 --> 12:21.015
- Moira: Hi there!
- Jocelyn: (Surprised) Moira.

12:21.016 --> 12:23.418
- Johnny: Jocelyn. Hi.
- Jocelyn: Johnny, hi.

12:23.419 --> 12:26.587
Moira: You look amazing. Utterly alive.

12:26.588 --> 12:29.424
I don't feel it. My lower
back is completely shot.

12:29.425 --> 12:31.292
Moira: Oh, dear. Why would that be?

12:31.293 --> 12:33.061
(Blows out her breath) Age?

12:33.062 --> 12:36.064
Even the slightest twitch
in bed throws it out.

12:36.065 --> 12:37.899
Moira: Perhaps a new
position would help?

12:37.900 --> 12:39.400
Would like to join us?

12:39.401 --> 12:41.369
No, I ate already.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.638
Couldn't put another thing in my mouth.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.406
Johnny: (Chuckling) Well, that's...
(Clears his throat)

12:45.407 --> 12:47.776
Moira: Okay. All right then.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.797
David: Oh my God.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.086
Stevie: They sell all kinds of stuff.

12:58.087 --> 12:59.787
- Stevie: Hey, Wayne.
- Wayne: Hey, Stevie.

12:59.788 --> 13:01.923
Stevie: Um... so this
is my friend David.

13:01.924 --> 13:03.873
David: David Rose. What are
your consignment percentages?

13:03.874 --> 13:05.426
(Garbage bag rustles)

13:05.427 --> 13:08.029
Uh, this is a thrift shop.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.530
Okay. Do you have sales representative?

13:09.531 --> 13:10.798
Who will be pricing these items?

13:10.799 --> 13:12.233
Wayne: Uh... me.

13:12.234 --> 13:13.968
David: Okay.

13:13.969 --> 13:15.736
(Bag rustles)

13:22.778 --> 13:24.479
Is there a problem, Wayne?

13:24.480 --> 13:26.247
Wayne: It's just...

13:26.248 --> 13:28.182
I can't really use any of this.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.618
It's too, you know...

13:30.619 --> 13:32.386
Funky?

13:32.387 --> 13:33.988
Sure. Let's go with that.

13:33.989 --> 13:36.891
David: Okay, let's take your
oily hands off my clothes.

13:36.892 --> 13:38.449
Stevie: You sure you can't
take any of this stuff?

13:38.450 --> 13:39.627
Some of this stuff's pretty good.

13:39.628 --> 13:41.863
Wayne: Um... maybe we
can use the sneakers.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.198
David: Maybe the sneakers?
This is French suede,

13:44.199 --> 13:46.634
with a vulcanized-rubber instep, okay?

13:46.635 --> 13:50.538
You've lost my trust
and my business, so...

13:50.539 --> 13:52.206
We'll be leaving now.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.308
- Stevie: Sorry.
- David: What is this place?

13:54.309 --> 13:56.210
<i>What is this place?!</i>

14:00.415 --> 14:03.885
(Birds chirp, footsteps crunch)

14:03.886 --> 14:07.054
- (Garbage pickers stab)
- Alexis: Ha!

14:07.055 --> 14:08.456
(Garbage falls off) Ugh!

14:10.192 --> 14:12.660
So... what happened to you yesterday?

14:12.661 --> 14:15.530
What happened to me?

14:15.531 --> 14:17.598
Yeah, I came back you were gone.

14:17.599 --> 14:20.368
Well, I had to do most
of the shift by myself.

14:20.369 --> 14:22.603
So thank God I had my rape whistle.

14:22.604 --> 14:25.773
Sorry. I had some stuff
I had to take care of.

14:25.774 --> 14:28.042
And did you get your
stuff taken care of?

14:28.043 --> 14:31.279
Yeah, I guess.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.015
Alexis: 'Cause it... It seems to me like

14:34.016 --> 14:39.153
you get your stuff taken
care of pretty regularly.

14:39.154 --> 14:41.589
By multiple people, if
you know what I mean.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.192
Mutt: I don't.

14:44.193 --> 14:46.360
Alexis: Look, I know you probably think

14:46.361 --> 14:49.931
that you're this handsome man
around town who's like...

14:49.932 --> 14:54.268
(Stabbing garbage) Handsome, mysterious...
And handsome and homeless-y

14:54.269 --> 14:57.574
but you're better than that, you know?

14:58.540 --> 15:00.107
Mutt: What?

15:00.108 --> 15:01.475
Alexis: Like, I don't judge. Trust me.

15:01.476 --> 15:05.537
I have been... I have been in the middle

15:05.538 --> 15:08.140
of some very messy group scenarios

15:08.141 --> 15:10.309
and I know how weird it can be, so...

15:12.078 --> 15:13.112
Mutt: Are you okay?

15:13.113 --> 15:15.080
Alexis: Yeah.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.183
I'm just saying that your
secret is safe with me.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.220
Wink.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.427
Let me just say, I get it.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.996
How much can one person take?

15:30.997 --> 15:33.632
Johnny: Well, may-maybe this
is not our place, Moira.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.902
Moira: And where does all
that pent up energy go?

15:36.903 --> 15:38.637
Jocelyn: I should go.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.306
- Roland: Hey...
- Jocelyn: (Awkward) Hey.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.642
Roland: Where have you been? I've
been looking for you all morning.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.710
<i>Jocelyn: (Evasive) Around. Doing stuff.</i>

15:44.711 --> 15:46.445
<i>Roland: Well, I tried calling you.</i>

15:46.446 --> 15:48.680
<i>Jocelyn: I must have turned
my phone off by mistake.</i>

15:48.681 --> 15:51.984
<i>Roland: Joce, did you
see him again today?</i>

15:51.985 --> 15:53.752
<i>Jocelyn: See who?</i>

15:53.753 --> 15:55.120
<i>Roland: Oh, geez, you know I told you,</i>

15:55.121 --> 15:56.622
you can see him as much as you want,

15:56.623 --> 15:59.191
just don't keep it a
secret from me, okay?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.493
I wanna know everything
you two are doing.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.429
<i>Jocelyn: Look, half the time I'm
there he doesn't even want me there.</i>

16:03.430 --> 16:06.331
<i>I just can't help myself.</i>

16:06.332 --> 16:08.167
<i>- Roland: Well, you love him.
- Jocelyn: Yeah.</i>

16:08.168 --> 16:12.838
<i>Roland: I love him too,
but the kid's an idiot.</i>

16:12.839 --> 16:14.973
It's our son, Mutt. We're
talking about our son.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.008
- Roland: Yeah.
- Johnny: Oh!

16:16.009 --> 16:17.843
- Roland: Our son.
- Moira: Oh!

16:17.844 --> 16:19.278
Roland: You done with that? Got it.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.880
Johnny: No, I wasn't. I wasn't uh...

16:21.881 --> 16:23.882
Yeah, he turned into a real nutbar.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.517
Doesn't drive in cars,

16:25.518 --> 16:28.020
he won't use anything plastic. (Chuckles)

16:28.021 --> 16:30.222
Good luck with birth control, right?

16:30.223 --> 16:33.392
Jocelyn: And then we
see you with your kids

16:33.393 --> 16:35.794
and you're so... together.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.899
What's your secret?

16:40.900 --> 16:44.303
Moira: Listening is so very important.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.673
Johnny: So important to listen...
To your kids.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.875
Jocelyn: See, Roland? Listening.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.341
Excuse me, I listen to the kid.

16:51.342 --> 16:53.512
If he'd listened to me, he
wouldn't be sitting in a hut,

16:53.513 --> 16:55.243
making his own underwear.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.949
(Birds chirp)

16:59.519 --> 17:02.454
(Door opens)

17:02.455 --> 17:04.589
The Internet is a breeding
ground for freaks.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.290
What're you doing?

17:06.291 --> 17:09.428
Well, I just "sold" a pair
of sunglasses on here

17:09.429 --> 17:13.432
and now dieforfash87
is telling me she won't pay

17:13.433 --> 17:15.733
'cause she thinks they're fake.

17:15.734 --> 17:20.873
Stevie: Okay. Um... How
about we move away-

17:20.874 --> 17:23.175
David: No! I don't even
wanna sell these things.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.111
These clothes are all that I have.

17:26.112 --> 17:29.414
Everything else has been taken from me.

17:29.415 --> 17:31.683
Well, you have your family...

17:31.684 --> 17:33.852
What's your point?

17:33.853 --> 17:37.022
I am having a very hard time
right now dealing with the idea

17:37.023 --> 17:40.526
that people think that
my things are worthless,

17:40.527 --> 17:42.261
- David: Or funky, or...
- Stevie: Sorry.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.062
...fake.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.497
Does it look like I shop on Canal Street?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.965
No...

17:46.966 --> 17:48.567
Okay.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.636
People here don't know anything, okay?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.004
Wayne huffs keyboard
cleaner for a living.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.305
Well, that's not surprising.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.873
You're playing to the wrong crowd.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.009
You're-you have great clothes.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.011
I like some of this stuff.

17:59.012 --> 18:01.880
Like... like this. Like, I like this.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.664
Ooh! Ooh...

18:05.490 --> 18:07.231
I like this.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.190
(Thinking) This gives me an idea.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.660
So why would I sleep with my mother?

18:12.661 --> 18:14.393
Alexis: Well, now that I
know that she's your mother,

18:14.394 --> 18:16.028
that makes a lot more sense to me.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.063
And you normally go
around spying on people?

18:18.064 --> 18:20.766
Um, you left me here to be abducted

18:20.767 --> 18:23.835
by long haul truckers. I
just went to find you.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.673
So why are you sneaking
around with your mom anyway?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.741
What's the big... secret?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.411
It's my dad. We don't really get along.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.446
He really takes the whole mayor
tradition in the family thing seriously

18:34.447 --> 18:37.216
and I'm just not that down
into labels, you know?

18:37.217 --> 18:39.051
- Alexis: "Labels?"
- Mutt: Yeah.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.720
And you wonder why I make fun of you.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.956
Oh, and you are totally in
sync with your parents?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.891
Um... yeah,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.593
because they always wanted
a daughter with a record,

18:47.594 --> 18:51.129
who dropped out of college, so...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.131
Pretty much delivered on that one.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.200
(Bags rustle)

18:56.903 --> 18:58.537
Ugh!

19:03.209 --> 19:05.410
<i>Oh! (Running footsteps)</i>

19:07.647 --> 19:09.414
(Door opens)

19:09.415 --> 19:10.849
<i>Stevie: Okay, this is
gonna cheer you up.</i>

19:10.850 --> 19:14.386
David: (Panting)

19:14.387 --> 19:16.922
So I thought you might be
lonely without your clothes.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.924
So if this isn't too dirty for you,

19:18.925 --> 19:21.493
I could help take care of your stuff.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.895
David: Wait, you wanna
have sex with me?

19:23.896 --> 19:25.564
Stevie: No. I don't think
anybody has sex in here

19:25.565 --> 19:27.032
unless they're being paid for it.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.553
I thought this might be a good
place to store your clothes.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.938
Is this a safe place?

19:32.939 --> 19:36.775
Yes. I'm the only with a key.
But there's a catch.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.646
I get to wear whatever I
want, anytime I want.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.584
Fine.

19:52.199 --> 19:55.935
Wow! Our son's clothes
are no longer in our closet.

19:55.936 --> 19:58.337
Something I said finally got through.

19:58.338 --> 20:00.139
<i>David: I just found
somewhere else to put them.</i>

20:00.140 --> 20:02.641
Johnny: I can't hear you from in there.

20:02.642 --> 20:05.044
<i>David: (Yelling loudly) I found
somewhere else to put them!</i>

20:05.045 --> 20:08.747
Well, subconsciously I got through.

20:08.748 --> 20:12.551
David? Alexis? Can you come here please?

20:12.552 --> 20:14.787
<i>Woman on TV: Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the text I got from her</i>

20:14.788 --> 20:16.422
<i>saying you left your
ring in the sauna...</i>

20:16.423 --> 20:18.591
David?! Alexis?!

20:18.592 --> 20:20.479
They're not going to come, dear.

20:21.895 --> 20:24.905
Johnny: Well, how
widespread is that news?

20:25.999 --> 20:27.132
<i>Woman on TV: I can hear
the (Unclear) Deal sign.</i>

20:27.133 --> 20:30.169
Talk about salacious!

20:30.170 --> 20:32.037
<i>Man on TV: He had long day at work.
I ran into Tanya on the street.</i>

20:32.038 --> 20:35.207
He cut off his what?!

20:35.208 --> 20:37.276
- Alexis: Wait, what? - Johnny: Okay.
- David: How did it happen?

20:37.277 --> 20:39.545
Johnny: Look, I just, uh...
I just want to make sure

20:39.546 --> 20:41.447
that, uh, you know, we're all okay.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.316
What were we not okay about?

20:44.317 --> 20:46.886
<i>Johnny: About your mother and me
feeling disconnected from you two.</i>

20:46.887 --> 20:49.788
David: We are literally connected
by a door that does not lock.

20:49.789 --> 20:51.957
How much... how much more
connected do you wanna be?

20:51.958 --> 20:55.127
Emma. Your middle name is "Emma."

20:55.128 --> 20:57.363
Alexis: Is it?

20:57.364 --> 20:58.764
Johnny: So, we'll keep
working away at this.

20:58.765 --> 21:00.666
I'm sorry! No, Hannah.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.167
Alexis: I'm embarrassed for you.

21:02.168 --> 21:03.096
- Well, that's that then.
- Elspeth.

21:03.097 --> 21:04.236
- Alexis: No!
- David: Wow.

21:04.237 --> 21:05.905
I think it's Elspeth.

21:05.906 --> 21:08.073
- Alexis: It isn't!
- I should know!

21:08.074 --> 21:09.825
Wow.

21:10.818 --> 21:16.315
