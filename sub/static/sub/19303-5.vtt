WEBVTT

00:38.748 --> 00:41.501
- Keep moving.
- We got her. Almost there.

00:41.668 --> 00:44.963
- Come on. Come on.
- Hold her steady.

00:45.839 --> 00:48.425
- A few more steps.
- She'll be okay.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.593
Oh, careful, careful.

00:52.762 --> 00:55.056
Oh. Oh.

00:56.558 --> 00:57.559
<i>David.</i>

00:57.726 --> 00:59.936
Okay, okay, easy, easy, easy.

01:00.103 --> 01:03.022
- And up.
- Careful. Careful.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.816
<i>- David?</i>
- Get me morphine.

01:04.983 --> 01:06.818
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.571
<i>David.</i>

01:16.119 --> 01:17.996
<i>I met your husband.</i>

01:18.163 --> 01:20.373
Careful.

01:20.540 --> 01:23.501
<i>He's a beat poet.</i>

01:45.273 --> 01:50.904
<i>I'm you. I'm me. I'm everything you wanna be.</i>

02:01.623 --> 02:03.458
He got the bullet out.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.669
Stopped the bleeding.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.173
Do you have a minute?

02:11.508 --> 02:13.259
Because....

02:14.302 --> 02:17.347
Well, yesterday we did some digging.

02:17.514 --> 02:19.182
Into your past.

02:20.016 --> 02:21.059
What's real.

02:22.101 --> 02:25.688
- And I think we may know.
- I know what I am.

02:26.815 --> 02:28.566
You do?

02:34.739 --> 02:35.907
I'm the magic man.

02:39.702 --> 02:42.497
- Aah!
- It's okay. It's okay.

02:42.664 --> 02:43.706
It's okay, heh.

02:44.415 --> 02:45.834
It's okay.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.214
I just wanted you to know,
I found a way for us to be together.

03:05.687 --> 03:07.897
I don't understand.

03:08.064 --> 03:11.317
It's all an illusion.

03:11.484 --> 03:13.611
I see that now.

03:13.987 --> 03:16.155
Why did I fight so hard?

03:16.322 --> 03:18.241
Where are we?

03:18.950 --> 03:21.411
It's just a room by a beach.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.580
I made it.

03:24.122 --> 03:28.042
They're signals, that's all.
What you see, what you hear.

03:30.169 --> 03:33.172
Impulses sent from nerve endings.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.425
Electricity in the brain.

03:35.592 --> 03:38.052
Real, fake. It's all the same.

03:43.933 --> 03:47.562
You know, they say the brain
is the largest erogenous zone.

04:04.996 --> 04:07.248
How did you--?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.171
We're not really touching.

04:34.943 --> 04:38.154
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

05:23.616 --> 05:25.410
How is she?

05:26.119 --> 05:30.832
The swelling is down,
but she's not responsive.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.878
Can't you just absorb her?
Fix her that way?

05:36.462 --> 05:42.218
I'd go into shock.
It's a very delicate ecosystem.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.561
He saw him, Cary.

05:53.104 --> 05:54.897
Oliver.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.318
In the astral plane.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.196
He told you?

06:04.991 --> 06:06.784
He can bring him back.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.661
I know it.

06:36.898 --> 06:40.526
<i>Classes start in five minutes.</i>

06:41.652 --> 06:43.738
I know where they're holding Amy.

06:45.782 --> 06:48.993
I'll be going to get her in the morning.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.040
David, we talked about this.

06:54.207 --> 06:56.250
I'm not asking you to go.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.503
Well, I'm going.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.423
These things take time.

07:02.924 --> 07:06.803
To scope, to observe.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.596
Who, how many.

07:08.763 --> 07:12.058
Defenses. Not just military.

07:12.225 --> 07:14.435
They have their own special help.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.187
People like you.

07:17.146 --> 07:21.067
Sydney, you saw this with Walter.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.699
I'll be fine.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.243
Maybe.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.620
If we surprise them.

07:33.329 --> 07:34.997
But no.

07:35.832 --> 07:37.625
They know.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.460
<i>You can't help her.</i>

07:39.627 --> 07:41.587
<i>Not yet.</i>

07:41.754 --> 07:45.341
Aren't you gonna ask about him?
The diver?

07:47.885 --> 07:49.720
How does he look?

07:50.930 --> 07:52.682
He looks good.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.976
Strong.

07:56.269 --> 07:58.396
He lives in an ice cube.

07:59.230 --> 08:02.525
I don't understand.
How long has he been in there?

08:02.692 --> 08:05.486
The astral whatever.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.614
In February it'll be 21 years.

08:10.783 --> 08:13.536
You know, David...

08:15.163 --> 08:18.082
...in the beginning he was just like you.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.502
Same kind of power.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.422
Psychic.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.301
Then he found a place...

08:28.467 --> 08:30.678
...where he could rule...

08:30.845 --> 08:33.639
...and be the creator.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.767
And he...

08:37.602 --> 08:40.313
...started spending
more and more time there.

08:44.108 --> 08:49.322
Sometimes I'd just find him sitting...

08:50.323 --> 08:53.326
...in someplace just staring into space.

08:59.165 --> 09:02.710
And then one day he just didn't wake up.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.007
<i>Did he ask about me?</i>

09:13.679 --> 09:15.431
He remembers very little, I think.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.684
Facts.

09:21.479 --> 09:25.608
He makes his own reality now.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.866
But there was a moment.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.831
Can you--?

09:43.626 --> 09:44.961
Can I see him?

09:49.382 --> 09:51.550
You want me to take you there?

09:57.932 --> 09:59.475
No.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.353
I just want you to bring him home.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.040
Hi.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.043
Miss me?

10:28.337 --> 10:30.047
Yes.

10:33.259 --> 10:34.593
Are you ready?

10:36.304 --> 10:37.888
Yeah.

10:53.321 --> 10:55.906
It's okay. I've got you.

10:58.326 --> 11:00.202
<i>Elevator going up.</i>

11:01.162 --> 11:03.080
<i>Mind the doors.</i>

11:07.668 --> 11:08.961
<i>Ascending.</i>

11:09.128 --> 11:11.881
Are we really going to D3 tomorrow?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.176
It'll be fun.

11:15.343 --> 11:18.429
Kick some ass, save the girl...

11:18.596 --> 11:20.431
...get a snack.

11:20.598 --> 11:23.225
They'll kill us. You know that, right?

11:24.477 --> 11:26.479
They'll try.

11:32.443 --> 11:34.695
Can we go back?

12:08.729 --> 12:11.107
Hey, was that your first time?

12:11.482 --> 12:13.067
No.

12:14.318 --> 12:17.029
My first time was--

12:17.196 --> 12:19.949
He was one of my mother's boyfriends.

12:20.116 --> 12:21.450
Your--

12:21.826 --> 12:22.993
I was 16.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.662
He was a journalist.

12:24.829 --> 12:28.332
We had a flirtation, and I was curious.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.711
One night they had too much to drink.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.840
My mom passed out on the couch.

12:36.298 --> 12:40.803
I heard him in the bathroom
taking a shower, so I touched her hand.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.432
And then I was her.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.726
We went into the bathroom.

12:50.438 --> 12:55.901
But the switch didn't last long then.

12:56.485 --> 13:00.030
And when he was inside me,
I changed back.

13:01.991 --> 13:04.326
And then my mom was there.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.163
And everybody was screaming.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.171
Who teaches us to be normal
when we're one of a kind?

13:18.382 --> 13:23.053
Just promise me,
if you get lost, we get lost together.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.280
What about strength in numbers?

14:23.447 --> 14:27.993
We can bring them as cannon fodder,
but they're just gonna slow us down.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.417
It's about Amy, right?

14:35.584 --> 14:38.003
Saving Amy?

14:40.548 --> 14:43.425
Come on, forget these losers.

14:43.801 --> 14:46.637
You saw what happened
when we worked together.

14:46.804 --> 14:51.392
Our muscle. These D3 patsies
aren't gonna know what hit them...

14:51.559 --> 14:54.853
...but we have to go now
and we have to move fast.

14:56.272 --> 14:59.316
Just promise me we'll come back here
when we have her.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.319
Mon frère, <i>I love it here.</i>

15:02.486 --> 15:04.738
<i>All these shiny, happy people.</i>

15:04.905 --> 15:06.448
David?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.451
<i>Time to go.</i>

15:53.537 --> 15:56.624
It's a facility in the woods,
so we have to go in on the ground.

15:56.790 --> 16:00.961
By which I mean we definitely
should not go in on the ground.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.339
That'd be dumb.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.302
He's gone.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.685
- Who?
- David. He--

16:18.729 --> 16:22.775
I heard voices.
Looked for him everywhere.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.985
He's not here.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.363
I think he went to D3.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.741
Shit. Wake everyone.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.203
We're going?

16:34.370 --> 16:35.954
To Division Three. Now?

16:36.121 --> 16:39.166
No plan, no intel.
Just chickens with our heads cut off--

16:39.333 --> 16:42.211
- He needs us.
- Then why'd he leave?

16:42.544 --> 16:46.131
The sense I get with that guy is he's only
ever thinking about <i>número uno.</i>

16:46.298 --> 16:47.966
So no, thank you.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.302
They have his sister.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.897
You don't think I have a sister?

17:02.064 --> 17:04.775
Or a girlfriend? Or a mom?

17:05.943 --> 17:07.695
This is war.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.113
We're fighting a war.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.825
It's bigger than some guy named David
and his sister.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.244
We can't lose him.

17:17.705 --> 17:18.956
Why?

17:22.251 --> 17:25.462
Because you think
he's going to bring Oliver back?

17:33.762 --> 17:35.139
No.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.516
Because he's too powerful.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.561
If they turn him....

17:47.943 --> 17:50.487
Let's go, everyone, wake up!

17:50.654 --> 17:54.032
Sydney, were you with him before?

17:54.533 --> 17:57.953
- How did he seem?
- David?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.122
He's....

18:03.876 --> 18:05.794
Something's changed.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.465
He, um...

18:11.508 --> 18:14.303
...found a way for us to be together.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.055
A place.

18:17.222 --> 18:21.351
Did you tell him what you found out there?
Philly, Dr. Poole?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.562
No.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.607
We did other things.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.943
Sydney...

18:31.320 --> 18:33.947
...I think we need to work together here.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.868
- David's treatment, it's not--
- Lady...

18:38.827 --> 18:40.871
...I'm not treating him.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.290
He's my man.

18:43.457 --> 18:46.293
Which means
I care about what he wants...

18:46.460 --> 18:48.754
...what we want.

18:48.921 --> 18:52.174
I could give a shit
about how he fits in here.

18:55.677 --> 18:59.306
I'm just saying be careful.
David's very fragile.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.600
He doesn't seem fragile.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.477
Not since he came back.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.020
I know.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.273
And that worries me.

19:40.889 --> 19:46.562
<i>The Moonies are up on their mountain</i>

19:46.728 --> 19:54.194
<i>The lunatics have taken over the asylum</i>

19:55.279 --> 20:02.160
<i>Waiting on the rapture</i>

20:07.332 --> 20:11.837
<i>Singing, "We're here</i>

20:13.839 --> 20:18.010
<i>To keep your prices down</i>

20:22.347 --> 20:27.436
<i>Feed you to the hounds</i>

20:30.689 --> 20:35.569
<i>To the Daily Mail</i>

20:36.653 --> 20:38.113
<i>Together"</i>

20:38.280 --> 20:42.576
<i>Promise me if you get lost,
we get lost together.</i>

20:47.748 --> 20:50.667
<i>You made a pig's ear</i>

20:50.834 --> 20:54.671
<i>You made a mistake</i>

20:58.008 --> 21:04.640
<i>Paid off security and got through the gate</i>

21:08.310 --> 21:11.146
<i>You got away with it</i>

21:11.313 --> 21:14.775
<i>But we lie in wait</i>

21:14.942 --> 21:17.235
<i>Eh, eh</i>

21:17.945 --> 21:21.740
<i>Eh, eh, eh</i>

21:28.956 --> 21:31.333
<i>Where's the truth?</i>

21:31.500 --> 21:32.876
Ready?

21:33.043 --> 21:36.880
<i>I'm hanging around, lost and found</i>

21:37.047 --> 21:40.801
<i>And when you're here, innocent</i>

21:40.968 --> 21:44.930
<i>Fat chance, no plan</i>

21:45.097 --> 21:48.767
<i>No regard for human life</i>

21:48.934 --> 21:52.938
<i>Keep trying
You're not right</i>

21:53.105 --> 21:56.900
<i>Fast and loose
You will lose</i>

21:57.067 --> 22:00.988
<i>Jumped the queue
Go back again</i>

22:01.154 --> 22:04.574
<i>President for life</i>

22:04.741 --> 22:08.495
<i>Lord of all the flies in the sky</i>

22:08.662 --> 22:12.499
<i>The beasts of the earth
The fish in the sea</i>

22:12.666 --> 22:14.710
<i>You've lost command</i>

22:14.876 --> 22:17.671
<i>Eh, eh, eh</i>

22:17.838 --> 22:20.507
<i>Uh, uh, uh</i>

22:21.967 --> 22:25.220
Move, move, move!

22:28.098 --> 22:29.766
This way.

22:46.158 --> 22:50.245
You go that way. We'll go this way.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.496
Let's go.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.877
Hello.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.132
Sydney.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.884
Thank God.

23:46.051 --> 23:51.306
You have to-- Please, just open the door.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.599
Where's David?

23:52.766 --> 23:56.311
He was here.
His sister was in the next cell.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.605
I told him, before, not now...

23:58.772 --> 23:59.815
...they took her.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.901
But that's what they do.
They come, they take us away.

24:03.068 --> 24:06.780
Questions. Always the same questions. Heh.

24:06.947 --> 24:12.494
He said he was gonna let me out,
but he didn't. Hmm.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.246
But you? Please.

24:14.412 --> 24:18.416
Where do they take you when they come?

24:22.587 --> 24:24.214
The light.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.425
The room with the big light.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.511
There's a switch.

24:30.137 --> 24:33.348
The door opens on its own.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.102
Please, Sydney.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.980
Let me out of here.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.651
Bitch.

25:02.210 --> 25:06.798
- Anything?
- No. But they record everything, so....

26:01.144 --> 26:03.647
Uh, Ms. Bird?

26:04.814 --> 26:06.650
I see it.

26:46.273 --> 26:48.066
<i>I just heard my sister.</i>

26:48.233 --> 26:50.068
<i>That wasn't a memory.</i>

26:50.235 --> 26:52.821
<i>Hey, don't move-- Don't move.
I'll be right back.</i>

26:52.988 --> 26:54.739
Yes, I checked that.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.160
No, I-- I can't stay still. I'm working.

26:59.327 --> 27:02.664
<i>Did you--? Did you leave?</i>

27:02.831 --> 27:04.916
Well, I know. I--

27:05.083 --> 27:07.168
It hurts me too.

27:07.335 --> 27:08.586
<i>Hello?</i>

27:08.753 --> 27:12.173
Did you have to let them kick you
in the crotch so many times?

27:21.224 --> 27:26.313
Maybe you should just, uh, watch my back.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.983
<i>Come on!</i>

27:30.692 --> 27:35.488
<i>Okay. I am-- I am done with this shit.</i>

27:38.074 --> 27:39.909
All right.

28:14.486 --> 28:17.572
We were wrong.

28:18.823 --> 28:24.037
We had it all wrong.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.664
Where is David?

28:26.831 --> 28:28.583
He took her.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.502
The sister.

28:31.586 --> 28:37.884
We knew he'd come. We were ready.

28:38.051 --> 28:41.096
We thought...

28:41.763 --> 28:43.640
...we were ready.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.725
What happened?

28:45.892 --> 28:48.186
So much power.

28:52.273 --> 28:57.821
It wears a human face.

28:59.614 --> 29:00.990
What?

29:02.325 --> 29:05.912
Be careful.

29:07.288 --> 29:11.543
It wears...

29:12.377 --> 29:19.384
...a human face.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.869
Syd.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.217
I don't understand.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.973
<i>- Ms. Bird. Hello, Ms. Bird?</i>
- Cary.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.141
<i>Cary.</i>

30:08.308 --> 30:10.894
<i>What--? What did you find?</i>

30:11.060 --> 30:12.729
It's complicated.

30:12.896 --> 30:16.774
David was here. He took Amy.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.987
Everyone is dead.

30:22.322 --> 30:25.492
<i>I think we were wrong.</i>

30:25.658 --> 30:27.410
- No.
<i>- The whole approach.</i>

30:27.577 --> 30:31.039
<i>Treating him like the others....</i>

30:31.206 --> 30:32.832
<i>He is schizophrenic.</i>

30:32.999 --> 30:34.792
This is not mental illness.

30:34.959 --> 30:38.505
<i>I mean split mind. This monster isn't David.</i>

30:38.671 --> 30:41.633
<i>It's a parasite of some kind.</i>

30:41.799 --> 30:44.552
<i>You see, another consciousness
inside of him.</i>

30:44.719 --> 30:46.638
What does that mean?

30:46.804 --> 30:51.976
<i>This thing burrowed into David's brain
when he was a boy.</i>

30:52.143 --> 30:53.436
<i>Maybe even a baby.</i>

30:53.603 --> 30:55.605
<i>And it has been there...</i>

30:56.105 --> 30:59.901
<i>...feeding on him ever since.</i>

31:00.068 --> 31:01.194
The memories.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.655
<i>The memories. Exactly.</i>

31:03.821 --> 31:10.161
<i>Every time David sees this thing
or realizes it's there...</i>

31:10.662 --> 31:13.164
<i>...this creature makes him forget.</i>

31:13.331 --> 31:16.251
<i>It rewrites his memory.</i>

31:16.417 --> 31:18.586
Is that why we couldn't see it?

31:18.753 --> 31:20.755
<i>I think so.</i>

31:20.922 --> 31:25.635
<i>But I think it made you forget as well.</i>

31:26.678 --> 31:29.305
<i>And the power of this thing....</i>

31:29.472 --> 31:33.518
- You're saying it has power, not David.
<i>- No.</i>

31:33.685 --> 31:36.938
<i>No.
David is a very, very powerful mutant.</i>

31:37.105 --> 31:39.941
<i>He has to be.
Otherwise this thing would split him apart.</i>

31:40.108 --> 31:44.153
You're calling this thing "it," but what else
could it be if not another mutant?

31:44.320 --> 31:46.656
<i>An older mutant.</i>

31:46.823 --> 31:51.286
<i>Its consciousness separated
from its body, you see...</i>

31:51.452 --> 31:54.539
<i>...and living inside David for...</i>

31:55.164 --> 31:56.749
<i>...30 years.</i>

32:04.048 --> 32:05.633
<i>Sydney.</i>

32:05.800 --> 32:07.510
<i>David?</i>

32:10.763 --> 32:11.931
Thank God.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.850
We were just--

32:14.684 --> 32:16.769
Are you okay?

32:17.395 --> 32:19.022
Shh.

32:37.665 --> 32:44.672
<i>Why are there so many songs
About rainbows?</i>

32:45.048 --> 32:49.802
<i>And what's on the other side?</i>

32:53.931 --> 32:56.476
<i>Rainbows are visions</i>

32:56.643 --> 32:59.771
<i>But only illusions</i>

32:59.937 --> 33:03.483
<i>Rainbows have nothing to hide</i>

33:07.320 --> 33:11.866
<i>So we've been told
And some choose to believe it</i>

33:12.700 --> 33:17.538
<i>I know they're wrong
Wait and see</i>

33:19.916 --> 33:26.089
<i>Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection</i>

33:26.255 --> 33:30.635
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

33:43.398 --> 33:44.941
<i>Not like this.</i>

33:45.108 --> 33:46.984
<i>It knows.</i>

33:52.198 --> 33:53.616
<i>King.</i>

33:54.951 --> 33:56.577
<i>Come on, boy.</i>

33:57.036 --> 33:58.788
What is it?

33:59.247 --> 34:01.249
He's home.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.710
He went home.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.128
David.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.171
Summerland?

34:07.922 --> 34:09.632
No.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.218
Where it started.

34:14.095 --> 34:15.763
We should go.

34:15.930 --> 34:18.433
There may be reinforcements on the way.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.848
Everything seems so small now.

35:01.893 --> 35:04.145
I can't believe you.

35:04.854 --> 35:08.524
What you did to save me.

35:08.858 --> 35:10.693
I didn't know.

35:13.196 --> 35:15.198
You knew.

35:19.243 --> 35:21.579
I was scared.

35:22.789 --> 35:26.125
Well, you don't have to be scared
anymore.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.298
Are you--?

35:34.550 --> 35:38.596
Did we come here for a reason?

35:39.722 --> 35:41.849
The old house.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.936
Don't you have a--?

35:46.020 --> 35:49.524
They made it sound like
you were part of a team.

35:49.690 --> 35:52.318
With, like, a headquarters.

35:52.485 --> 35:54.946
They'll be here soon.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.657
I thought we could...

36:01.327 --> 36:04.163
...talk first.

36:11.379 --> 36:13.130
Okay.

36:13.548 --> 36:15.675
Yeah. Um....

36:17.718 --> 36:19.971
What do you wanna talk about?

36:20.429 --> 36:22.723
I wanna know your secret.

36:25.017 --> 36:28.479
- What do you--?
- I can smell it, see?

36:28.646 --> 36:30.606
The secret.

36:35.152 --> 36:39.740
Probably always,
but now it's really clear.

36:40.491 --> 36:44.370
You know something about me.

36:44.537 --> 36:46.289
David....

36:57.508 --> 36:59.218
Hi.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.556
Look at you.

37:05.433 --> 37:08.269
She's actually got kind of a hot bod...

37:08.436 --> 37:12.857
...under all that
tight-ass house-frau bullshit.

37:16.485 --> 37:18.154
Who are you?

37:22.033 --> 37:23.075
I'm David.

37:24.493 --> 37:25.578
Oh, wait, I'm Benny.

37:25.745 --> 37:27.246
I mean I'm Lenny.

37:27.872 --> 37:29.290
Or is it...

37:29.457 --> 37:30.458
...King?

37:32.209 --> 37:34.337
Or-- Or is it my favorite?

37:34.503 --> 37:38.841
No, no, no.

37:47.683 --> 37:49.936
You have a secret.

37:54.732 --> 37:56.567
Please.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.195
My whole life is a lie.

38:01.197 --> 38:03.699
I just need to know.

38:04.742 --> 38:06.869
Who am I?

38:12.708 --> 38:16.045
You-- You were adopted.

38:34.689 --> 38:36.983
Who?

38:39.652 --> 38:41.529
I don't know.

38:43.823 --> 38:45.741
I was young.

38:46.242 --> 38:49.453
Mom and Dad, they--

38:49.620 --> 38:53.332
They were going--
They were gonna tell you.

38:55.251 --> 38:57.003
<i>And then they--</i>

38:58.004 --> 38:59.880
<i>And I just--</i>

39:01.382 --> 39:03.426
<i>You-- You were ju--</i>

39:04.802 --> 39:08.264
You were so upset all the time.

39:09.890 --> 39:12.476
- And the illness.
- I don't have an illness.

39:12.643 --> 39:14.311
I know.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.814
I know.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.608
Now.

39:21.986 --> 39:25.239
And I don't know. I just thought...

39:26.282 --> 39:28.451
...if I told you, it--

39:29.326 --> 39:31.787
It would make things worse.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.296
Exactly.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.298
This will--

39:42.465 --> 39:47.595
May isolate the entity, paralyze it...

39:47.762 --> 39:50.973
...letting us talk to David privately.

39:51.682 --> 39:57.021
Well, I don't think it's a very good idea
either, but we don't have any choice.

39:57.188 --> 39:59.231
You will just have to--

39:59.398 --> 40:01.692
Maybe there won't even be a fight.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.072
Don't kid yourself, old man.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.534
There's always a fight.

40:48.197 --> 40:49.448
Wait.

40:49.615 --> 40:52.952
Be careful. There's a chance
we've left the real world...

40:53.119 --> 40:54.870
...that we're in David's world now.

40:55.037 --> 40:56.080
And that's bad? Why?

40:57.206 --> 41:00.876
Well, that would make him God,
and he's crazy, so....

41:01.043 --> 41:02.378
Stop it.

41:02.545 --> 41:04.296
He's not crazy.

41:05.798 --> 41:09.927
This is much, much more.

41:20.521 --> 41:21.689
<i>Hey.</i>

46:15.983 --> 46:16.984
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Aah!

46:18.360 --> 46:19.862
No. No.

46:20.028 --> 46:23.073
No, no. This is not the talking place.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.618
This is the listening place.

46:38.046 --> 46:39.590
Such a pretty boy.

46:46.346 --> 46:48.515
And then you people...

46:48.932 --> 46:51.518
...started putting all these ideas in his head.

46:51.685 --> 46:53.312
<i>Ideas in his head.</i>

47:04.823 --> 47:05.949
Sydney!

47:13.665 --> 47:14.958
No, no.

47:17.419 --> 47:21.173
<i>David. White room, now.</i>

47:33.519 --> 47:35.187
Syd...

47:38.023 --> 47:40.651
- ...I can't stop her.
- David.

47:41.610 --> 47:42.861
Me.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.780
David.

47:47.658 --> 47:50.786
Listen to me. David? David.

47:57.084 --> 47:58.710
David.

48:00.045 --> 48:03.215
Wait. Stop. David.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.095
David.

48:14.935 --> 48:16.728
David!

48:18.021 --> 48:19.022
It's....

48:35.080 --> 48:37.416
David! Aah!

48:46.883 --> 48:51.263
<i>Hello, everyone.
Tonight's movie is</i> Singing in the Rain.

48:51.430 --> 48:56.310
<i>Bring your blankies and brollies
for a romping good time.</i>

49:07.988 --> 49:09.406
Sydney?

49:10.824 --> 49:12.659
I'm sorry...

49:12.826 --> 49:14.828
...what was I saying?

49:15.329 --> 49:16.413
Uh....

49:18.165 --> 49:20.417
You were saying....

49:21.043 --> 49:24.921
You were talking about how the death
of your father affected you.

49:25.088 --> 49:28.634
And I think that's very brave.

49:33.472 --> 49:35.140
Okay.

49:37.601 --> 49:39.603
Let's talk.
