<i>State your purpose.</i>

13:53.333 --> 13:54.933
Please excuse
the intrusion, Captain.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.669
We'll be on our way
as soon as we calculate
our hyperspace jump.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.971
MINING GUILD CAPTAIN:
<i>We will not authorize</i>
<i>any such jump</i>

13:59.973 --> 14:02.373

<i>slow your speed,</i>

14:10.550 --> 14:12.517

14:12.519 --> 14:13.952

15:04.169 --> 15:06.437
This is the place.
Hello?

15:07.172 --> 15:09.240
Are you there?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.808
I can sense your presence.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.697
Hello.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.708
Imperial prison is bad,

15:43.710 --> 15:46.711
but where the Mining Guild
will send us is worse!

15:46.713 --> 15:48.112
Hang on!

15:55.721 --> 15:56.955
Brace yourselves.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.263
Chopper, we're clear.
Charge the hyperdrive.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.733
Wait. We should destroy
the transport before they
contact the Empire.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.435
They probably
already have.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.770
No! We're not leaving
any witnesses.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.672
That's not our mission, Ezra.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.940
She's right, Lieutenant.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.609
The important thing here is
to proceed with our mission.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.445
Fine. Make the jump.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.580
Hyperspace, here we come.

16:25.084 --> 16:28.619
Ah. You heard my call.
Good.

16:28.621 --> 16:32.657
Your imbalance woke me
from a deep slumber.

16:32.659 --> 16:38.596
Imbalance? Your presence is like a
violent storm in this quiet world.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.264
You're a Force wielder.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.201
But you're not a Jedi.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.269
Wielder? Hmm.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.373
Jedi and Sith wield
the Ashla and Bogan,

16:48.375 --> 16:50.775
the light and the dark.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.278
I'm the one in the
middle, the Bendu.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.381
What do you
call yourself?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.716
I am Kanan Jarrus,
Jedi Knight.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.620
You carry conflict
with you, Kanan Jarrus,

17:02.622 --> 17:04.589
Jedi Knight.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.193
It's this.
(CHUCKLING)

17:09.195 --> 17:12.063
Ah. Interesting.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.066
KANAN: Careful. It's...

17:16.235 --> 17:18.636
(SIGHS)
dangerous.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.971
How so?

17:19.973 --> 17:22.573
It's a Sith holocron,
a source of evil.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.008
My student's
been using it,

17:24.010 --> 17:25.643
and I'm afraid
it's changing him.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.713
An object cannot
make you good or evil.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.583
The temptation of power,
forbidden knowledge,

17:32.585 --> 17:34.185
even the desire
to do good

17:34.187 --> 17:37.155
can lead some
down that path.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.625
But only you
can change yourself.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.593
Not always.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.362
A-ha!

17:44.364 --> 17:47.565
Your conflict
becomes clear.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.933
That device
in the ground,

17:48.935 --> 17:50.401
why do you have it?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.336
It keeps the spiders
from attacking me.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.571
May I see it?

17:58.744 --> 18:01.679
Hey, hey! What did you do?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.347
I am helping you.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.616
It was the only thing
protecting me from
those creatures!

18:05.618 --> 18:07.585
You believe that,

18:07.587 --> 18:10.088
but you must learn to
see things differently now.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.626
Look, I can't see
anything, not anymore.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.896
No. You are unwilling.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.299
Are you saying there's a way
to restore my vision?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.701
Your sight
cannot be healed,

18:23.703 --> 18:25.536
but I can teach you
to see...

18:27.739 --> 18:28.806
if you're willing.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.643
What must I do?

18:35.714 --> 18:38.449
I'm certain Governor Pryce
is overestimating

18:38.451 --> 18:40.718
how organized
the resistance is.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.454
While it's true there are
pockets of rebellion,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.123
there has never been
any evidence

18:45.125 --> 18:48.259
of a larger scale,
galaxy-wide operation.

18:48.261 --> 18:51.629
And I would like to
keep it that way,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.831
Admiral Konstantine.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.234
Grand Admiral Thrawn.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.568
"Grand Admiral"?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.604
The Emperor
recently promoted me

18:59.606 --> 19:01.772
after my victory at Batonn.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.408
Civilian casualties
outnumbered

19:04.410 --> 19:06.677
the insurgents
at the time.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.113
Acceptable margins,
Agent Kallus,

19:09.115 --> 19:11.682
for there are no longer
rebels in that sector.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.619
Well, Thrawn, what do
you think of Governor
Pryce's theory

19:14.621 --> 19:16.587
about the rebels
in the Lothal sector?

19:16.589 --> 19:20.424
This is a pirate our rebels
rescued from Naraka prison,

19:20.426 --> 19:22.426
Hondo Ohnaka.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.529
Within the last hour,
the Phoenix Squadron

19:24.531 --> 19:26.197
destroyed Mining
Guild ships

19:26.199 --> 19:29.333
using the Sereeda
Hyperspace Waypoint.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.436
Taken separately,
they may seem unrelated,

19:32.438 --> 19:33.838
but Ohnaka's cellmate

19:33.840 --> 19:37.008
was a laborer at our
starfighter reclamation plant

19:37.010 --> 19:38.609
in the Yarma system,

19:38.611 --> 19:41.946
one jump point away
from the Sereeda attack.

19:41.948 --> 19:45.950
Grand Admiral Thrawn
believes the rebels intend
to raid the plant

19:45.952 --> 19:48.886
and steal fighters
for their fleet.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.889
Every ship
they add to their arsenal
increases the threat

19:51.891 --> 19:54.725
to our own armada
and the Emperor's plans.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.861
I trust you have a solution?

19:56.863 --> 19:59.330
I will start
my operations here

19:59.332 --> 20:02.833
and pull the rebels apart
piece by piece.

20:02.835 --> 20:06.871
They will be the architects
of their own destruction.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.880
No Imperial traffic
on the scopes,

20:15.882 --> 20:17.915
but no sign of
the station either.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.917
It is down there,
my friends.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.087
And those ships
are ripe for plunder.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.823
There's no telling
what we're flying into.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.125
Let's find out.
Take us down.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.401
There it is.
Reklam Station.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.203
Chopper, get a count
on those bombers.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.671

20:42.908 --> 20:45.343

Y-wing light bombers.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.278
Looks like they're
in decent shape, too.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.913
Yeah, but according
to Chopper's scan,

20:48.915 --> 20:50.281
there's only 15 left.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.285
Correction.
There are only 14 left.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.287
Looks like
they're being destroyed.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.755
We need to move in now.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.790
There won't
be any ships left if we wait.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.693
Hold on. Our orders
are to recon the station,

21:02.695 --> 21:04.095
not go after ships.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.030
We should advise
Captain Syndulla.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.232
What if the Empire
detects our transmission?

21:08.234 --> 21:10.368
I was given command
of this assignment.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.936
I know what
the objective was

21:11.938 --> 21:14.138
and I am changing it.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.941
We're going in now.
That's an order.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.683
Yes, sir.

21:29.655 --> 21:32.123

We're losing ships.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.325
Well, Lieutenant,
what's your plan
to get 'em out of there?

21:34.327 --> 21:35.860
Here's what
we're gonna do...
Look out!

21:39.898 --> 21:41.299
What was that?

21:41.301 --> 21:44.935
Oh, right, right.
That is probably
a dismantler droid.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.272
Forgot that Terba said
there might be some
guarding the station.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.174
When were you gonna
share that information?

21:50.176 --> 21:51.876
Well, of course
I just did.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.286
Commander Titus,
we have a perimeter breach.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.355
Dismantler droids
have been activated.

22:04.357 --> 22:08.025

warned us about.
