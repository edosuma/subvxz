WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.481
- The Legends of Tomorrow
are everywhere.

00:03.525 --> 00:05.222
Since they defeated a demon
with the help of a dragon

00:05.266 --> 00:08.312
on national TV, they've
become a worldwide obsession.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.098
Sure,
we've all been mesmerized

00:11.141 --> 00:12.534
by the
global phenomenon

00:12.577 --> 00:14.144
known as "Legends-mania."

00:14.188 --> 00:15.928
- Yum.
-  Yum!

00:15.972 --> 00:19.932
- And the Oscar for best
picture goes to--

00:19.976 --> 00:21.630
- But who are
the people beneath

00:21.673 --> 00:24.111
those supersized
public personas?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.721
- Roar.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.940
- What are they like
when the spotlight is off?

00:27.984 --> 00:30.552
- I'm Kevin Harris, and my
documentary film crew is

00:30.595 --> 00:33.033
the first ever to be granted
unfettered access

00:33.076 --> 00:36.079
to their lives
and their ship, the Waverider.

00:36.123 --> 00:40.736
So strap in because today,
we meet the Legends.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.396
So why don't we start
with just a brief introduction,

00:48.439 --> 00:50.789
and let us know what we're
doing today on the Waverider.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.964
- Uh, yeah.

00:52.008 --> 00:55.142
Hi, I'm--I'm Ava Sharpe.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.448
After Congress shut down
the Time Bureau,

00:57.492 --> 01:00.234
Sara went off to help
Oliver Queen and, uh,

01:00.277 --> 01:02.366
I had to fight to keep the
Waverider from being impounded.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.238
Bad luck that the senator
chairing the committee

01:04.281 --> 01:07.110
was the same person we almost
killed last year.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.807
- Senator Wellington, I know

01:08.851 --> 01:11.245
the Time Bureau may have been
compromised, but you must allow

01:11.288 --> 01:13.421
the Waverider to continue
patrolling the timeline.

01:13.464 --> 01:16.380
- Ms. Sharpe, how do we know
these so called "Legends"

01:16.424 --> 01:18.382
can be trusted
with time travel?

01:18.426 --> 01:21.168
Well, there's simply
no transparency.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.387
- Which is why
you all are here.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.520
Right?
To show everyone what we do.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.000
What could go wrong?

01:28.044 --> 01:30.220
- The Waverider was
surprisingly quiet

01:30.264 --> 01:32.396
because half the team was away
on a mission.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.139
- Oh, the crossover,
yeah, had to take a rain check.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.707
See, when you are a superhero

01:38.750 --> 01:40.578
slash amusement park
impresario,

01:40.622 --> 01:43.233
slash historian
that rises from the dead,

01:43.277 --> 01:46.584
your dance card tends to get
pretty full.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.805
For two full minutes,
I was not alive.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.895
That changes you, man.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.027
Don't get me wrong,
I love fame.

01:55.071 --> 01:57.552
No one says no to you
about anything.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.597
Hey, man, that's a cool hat.
Can I have it?

02:01.295 --> 02:05.386
But still,
something doesn't feel right.

02:09.825 --> 02:12.958
- Oh, sorry.
Hang on.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.571
There we go.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.747
Hi, I'm Behrad Tarazi.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.009
I guess you probably think

02:20.052 --> 02:21.141
I'm some kind
of awesome future man,

02:21.184 --> 02:23.186
since I'm from 2044.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.580
My literal birthday
was yesterday,

02:25.623 --> 02:29.671
which is pretty wild, man.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.107
That's me.

02:31.151 --> 02:35.372
Hey baby Behrad,
be easy and go with the flow,

02:35.416 --> 02:38.462
like Wu-Tang Clan
and Bruce Lee.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.682
- I mean, now that we're no
longer D-list superheroes,

02:40.725 --> 02:43.989
we can just go where we want,
do as we please.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.427
Why have I stuck around?

02:46.470 --> 02:48.733
Tell you the truth,
I have no bloody clue.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.996
I am bored as a post.
Ain't I?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.869
Gids, I'm nicking the jumpship,
all right?

02:53.912 --> 02:55.305
I'll see you when I see you.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.307
- The jumpship is
fully totemed.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.700
- She's a mad old bat,
that one.

03:02.530 --> 03:06.664
- Hi, I'm Mona Wu.
I'm a Kaupe.

03:06.708 --> 03:10.538
Uh, that's basically like
a werewolf but Hawaiian.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.933
I'm also a literary agent

03:14.977 --> 03:17.327
for romance novelist
Rebecca Silver,

03:17.371 --> 03:19.547
who is secretly Mick Rory.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.202
Jeez, Peter, take me out on a
date first before you try to

03:22.245 --> 03:23.725
you know.

03:23.768 --> 03:26.423
Basically, what I do is
I sell movie rights,

03:26.467 --> 03:28.773
get book advances,
that kind of stuff.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.994
You're telling me that you
don't have a single dollar

03:32.037 --> 03:34.039
for a Rebecca Silver
book advance?

03:34.083 --> 03:36.259
Okay, now you're not just
disrespecting me,

03:36.303 --> 03:37.956
you're disrespecting my client!

03:40.481 --> 03:45.442
Not now!
Pay up or I will thrash you!

03:47.096 --> 03:50.360
- Hi, I'm Gary Green.

03:50.404 --> 03:54.016
Um, if I had to sum myself up
in two words

03:54.059 --> 03:55.670
they would be, uh,
fully forgiven.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.282
A lot of things happened last
year that you could misconstrue

03:59.326 --> 04:02.285
as potentially,
maybe being my fault.

04:02.329 --> 04:05.201
But thankfully everyone
agrees that at worst

04:05.245 --> 04:07.247
I was just a hapless rube
who got manipulated

04:07.290 --> 04:10.337
by the forces of Hell
to betray humanity.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.729
I had a fairy godmother named
Nora,

04:11.773 --> 04:14.602
but we separated amicably
after she granted me

04:14.645 --> 04:15.994
my heart's deepest wish.

04:16.038 --> 04:17.169
- Gary,
what the hell are you doing?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.389
Come on, we've got bigger fish
to fry.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.652
- Nora made me Constantine's
apprentice.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.088
- Gary!

04:23.132 --> 04:24.438
- Call me.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.399
- So how does your girlfriend
feel

04:29.443 --> 04:30.661
about the documentary
being made?

04:30.705 --> 04:33.142
- Actually, I haven't,
uh, told Sara

04:33.185 --> 04:35.666
about the--the
documentary yet.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.581
I just think it was a little
awkward over the phone.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.322
It's better to, you know,
spring it on her

04:39.366 --> 04:40.715
when she gets back
from the big mission.

04:40.758 --> 04:44.284
Okay, big smiles everyone.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.547
And nobody mention
Oliver Queen.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.548
- Why?

04:48.636 --> 04:49.724
- Because he died.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.203
- Shouldn't have done
the crossover.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.557
Surprise!

04:56.600 --> 04:57.775
- Yeah!

05:00.648 --> 05:02.737
Oh, bros.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.478
- Orange drink or limeade?

05:04.521 --> 05:05.653
- Alcohol.

05:05.696 --> 05:09.134
- Hey, love.
Welcome back, baby.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.310
- What is going on?

05:10.353 --> 05:11.920
- Before you object,
let me explain.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.617
The only way that I could stop
Senator Wellington

05:13.661 --> 05:14.966
from cutting
off our funding was

05:15.010 --> 05:18.448
to be clear and
transparent about our process.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.928
Get it?

05:19.971 --> 05:22.626
- So you're shooting a
documentary about the Legends?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.933
- Not me, per se.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.587
- Hi, Captain Lance, huge fan.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.153
Uh, I'm the director,
Kevin Harris.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.155
You can call me Kev.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.723
Just carry on, do what you're
doing; we're not even here.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.639
- That's Kev.
He's got it under control.

05:35.683 --> 05:40.644
- And what if I wanna talk
about something in private?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.037
- It's not a problem,

05:42.080 --> 05:43.691
that's what the confessional
interviews are for.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.475
- Oh.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.956
Okay, so I can--I can
just say it to the camera.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.131
- Sure.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.438
- My girlfriend,
she's lost her mind.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.745
She just--she really
probably needs a nap.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.486
She gets a little sleepy
after a long mission.

05:56.530 --> 06:00.098
Um--oh, Mick,
why don't you tell us all

06:00.142 --> 06:01.491
what you do on the ship, huh?

06:01.535 --> 06:04.276
- I steal stuff.
Get out of my way, you punks.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.280
- Okay, he's just joking.
Uh, Ray!

06:08.324 --> 06:10.544
Who else saved the multiverse?

06:10.587 --> 06:15.026
- Oh, uh, well The Flash,
Supergirl, Batwoman.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.027
- Cool
- Yeah.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.246
- What, no Superman?

06:17.289 --> 06:18.508
Couldn't have been
that big a deal.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.031
- Oh, no, no,
Superman was there.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.511
- He's very handsome.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.904
- It's good to have you back,
buddy.

06:22.947 --> 06:23.992
- Yeah.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.560
Hey, we're missing someone.

06:26.603 --> 06:27.952
Where's Charlie?

06:27.996 --> 06:29.301
- Took the jumpship
for a joyride.

06:29.345 --> 06:32.435
- A joyride to check
the timeline.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.524
Right?
It's called a timescout.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.048
Now, who wants to visit
the temporal zone?

06:37.092 --> 06:38.833
Shall we?

06:41.705 --> 06:43.185
Guys, I'm still outside.

06:43.228 --> 06:46.275
I'm still outside!
Don't leave me!

06:46.318 --> 06:48.930
- Hi, I'm Ray Palmer,
The Atom.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.280
This documentary is an exciting
opportunity

06:51.323 --> 06:53.456
for me to improve
my image.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.806
A lot of people still
confuse me for the demon

06:55.850 --> 06:59.070
who possessed me and opened up
the gates of Hell.

06:59.114 --> 07:02.900
His name was Neron and he is
no longer with me or inside me

07:02.944 --> 07:04.467
or, um...

07:04.511 --> 07:07.383
I really wish that you could
meet my girlfriend, Nora.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.734
But she works out of town
a lot, internationally.

07:10.778 --> 07:14.172
She's got a lot
of global clients, kids mostly.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.565
She is a fairy godmother.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.959
- There's something behind you.

07:19.787 --> 07:23.486
- Is this a timequake?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.749
- See, I knew the timeline
was still in jeopardy.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.098
What do we got?

07:27.142 --> 07:30.188
Time pirates, time terrorism,
time sex tourism?

07:30.232 --> 07:32.103
- Jeez, Ava, you could be
a supervillain

07:32.147 --> 07:33.235
if you applied yourself.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.106
- Gideon,
what's the point of origin?

07:35.150 --> 07:38.588
- It appears my Jonah Hex
has beebo lala loves you.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.372
- Gideon may have a virus.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.766
- Doesn't she make
everything work?

07:42.810 --> 07:43.941
- We are perfectly safe.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.030
- Guys, that was
a class five timequake.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.684
That is so dangerous.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.513
- Okay, guys, let's just try to
keep our composure, shall we?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.210
- I've triangulated
the timequake

07:52.254 --> 07:54.735
to 1917,
St. Petersburg, Russia.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.607
Let's go
and shrink the problem.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.567
I'm developing a catchphrase?

08:00.610 --> 08:02.612
- Executing time jump now.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.702
- No, Gideon, we're not taking
a film crew to--

08:09.489 --> 08:12.230
Imperial Russia.
Yeah.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.756
Great.
This is great, Ray.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.628
- All right, Legends,
put on your babushkas

08:18.672 --> 08:22.240
because we are
rushing into Russia.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.504
- And now you're copying
my thing.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.027
- Totally, I just got
really excited.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.377
- Okay, listen, babe,
this may seem like a problem,

08:28.420 --> 08:30.553
but let's turn it into
a "probltunity," huh?

08:30.597 --> 08:33.600
- Maybe a party snake is just
what the doctor ordered.

08:33.643 --> 08:36.211
- Uh, what's a party snake?

08:36.254 --> 08:38.822
- A sneak, party sneak.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.998
- The wonder of time travel
is allowing our cameras

08:41.042 --> 08:43.000
to capture some of
the first color images

08:43.044 --> 08:45.002
of imperial Russia
as we ride along

08:45.046 --> 08:47.614
on the Legends' patented
party sneak.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.834
- Turns out it's more
of a fun funeral sneak.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.270
- Who died?

08:52.314 --> 08:55.056
- Grigori Rasputin AKA
The Mad Monk.

08:55.099 --> 08:58.494
Equal parts mystic advisor
and manipulative hornball.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.323
- Rasputin was notoriously
hard to kill.

09:01.366 --> 09:04.848
It took cyanide, a gun, and
drowning before he stayed dead.

09:15.424 --> 09:19.428
- Um, guys, we sure
he stayed dead?

09:23.998 --> 09:25.565
- Rasputin came back
from the dead,

09:25.608 --> 09:27.871
and it caused a timequake.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.091
Ugh, this is
the kind of problem

09:30.134 --> 09:31.614
that I can wrap my head around.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.835
So I need you guys
to forget about this

09:34.878 --> 09:36.880
documentary film crew
and focus

09:36.924 --> 09:38.621
on the mission at hand,
yes?

09:38.665 --> 09:41.537
- Yes, we need to minimize
the mishap.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.930
- Ooh, Ray, that's good.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.715
Because saving the day
is what the Legends do best.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.412
Ava, you're in my shot.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.718
- Oh, sorry.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.590
- Gideon, what does
the historical record say?

09:50.633 --> 09:52.592
- Perhaps timeloop--timeloop
released him

09:52.635 --> 09:53.984
from Marion Ravenwood.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.986
- Of course.
Okay.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.466
B-Money, with me.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.947
We're gonna fix Gideon, get our
guests back to 2020.

09:59.990 --> 10:03.777
Mona, Nate, Ray, I want you
three researching Rasputin.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.300
Figure out what his next move
is gonna be.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.954
Okay?
Let's do it.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.523
- Hey, Ray.
Sorry, but just--

10:11.567 --> 10:15.440
hey, is everything okay
with Sara?

10:15.484 --> 10:18.400
- Oh, um, I don't know.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.272
But I do know that Oliver's
death was pretty tough on her.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.796
- Yeah.

10:22.839 --> 10:26.974
- Maybe you should write Sara
a condolence card.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.675
- It's actually not a bad idea.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.547
I guess I could try to put
my thoughts and feelings

10:35.591 --> 10:38.463
into words on a card.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.640
- What if more baddies start
coming back,

10:40.683 --> 10:41.945
like,
throughout history?

10:41.989 --> 10:46.341
- If they do, we can call them
evil do-overs.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.299
- Villa-agains.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.084
- I like encores.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.130
It's a good idea.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.479
- We could take a vote,
we could take like a--

10:54.523 --> 10:55.437
- Okay, let's vote, let's vote.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.438
- Encores.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.787
- Villa-agains.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.006
- Encores.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.051
- Eh.
- Don't be a jerk about it.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.792
Encores!

11:02.836 --> 11:05.142
- Meanwhile, back in New York,

11:05.186 --> 11:08.972
Constantine and Gary were
doing some soul searching.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.671
- We're here with the great
mage John Constantine

11:11.714 --> 11:14.151
responding to an urgent call
regarding the supernatural.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.807
- Oh bloody hell, Gary,
you know I must have been

11:17.851 --> 11:22.464
off my rocker
when I made you my assistant.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.595
- Mr. Constantine.

11:23.639 --> 11:24.988
- It's what the card says,
love.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.424
- It's my son Edgar.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.339
I came home late from my shift.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.906
Usually he's up
playing video games.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.342
- All right, love,
there you go.

11:31.386 --> 11:34.476
Now why don't you let me
take a look, eh?

11:44.791 --> 11:45.748
- What's wrong with him?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.358
- His PJs, for starters.

11:48.664 --> 11:51.058
Do people really wear matching
pajama sets?

11:51.101 --> 11:52.059
- Yes.

11:53.974 --> 11:57.412
- Exorcizamos te,
omnis immundus spiritus,

11:57.455 --> 11:59.806
omnis satanic potestas,

11:59.849 --> 12:01.808
- John, wait.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.027
- Masher?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.160
Masher, is that you
possessing the lad?

12:06.203 --> 12:09.250
- Glad to see you escaped Hell.

12:09.293 --> 12:12.427
- Yeah, well, I could say
the same about you, mate.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.037
- Demon's gotta have his fun.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.214
- Yeah, well, I could murder
a pint right about now.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.607
Fancy a drink?

12:18.650 --> 12:19.695
- You're buying.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.870
- You've got it,
let's go.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.438
- Uh, excuse me,
greatest of warlocks,

12:23.481 --> 12:27.137
but what about Edgar's mother?

12:27.181 --> 12:29.139
- Good thinking, G-man.

12:29.183 --> 12:32.186
We'll take the fire escape.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.497
- What exe--able do you wi--x
Captain cat--what interval--

12:39.541 --> 12:41.412
- Easy on Gideon, Cap.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.372
- What are you wix--table
Captain cat, captain cat--

12:44.415 --> 12:47.897
- Is everybody just trying
to get on my nerves today?

12:47.941 --> 12:51.901
Camera crew shows up and, what,
nobody can act like themselves?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.774
- Spotlight does weird things
to people.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.994
But, hey, you know I'll always
be my true self.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.083
- Oh yeah?
Your true self?

13:00.127 --> 13:02.129
Don't your parents think
you're in business school?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.870
- I am a tangled web.

13:04.566 --> 13:05.785
Enough about me.

13:06.263 --> 13:09.092
How you doing with Oliver
and everything?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.356
I'm fine.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.967
- No worries,
we don't have to talk about it.

13:15.577 --> 13:19.624
But, I made you something.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.452
- Oh, please don't be
a condolence card

13:21.496 --> 13:23.672
'cause those are
always super awkward.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.935
- Nah,
hopefully something better.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.769
It's you, Ollie, and Laurel.

13:33.813 --> 13:38.556
- B, this is actually--
it's really sweet.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.123
Thank you.

13:40.167 --> 13:43.300
- My condolence card
wasn't awkward.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.868
"Dear Sara, I'm sorry
the vigilante you slept with

13:45.912 --> 13:47.652
"when he was already dating
your sister died.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.263
"Some say it's better
to have loved and lost,

13:49.306 --> 13:51.308
but I hope
you never loved him at all."

13:51.352 --> 13:54.442
Sara and I aren't the type to
give each other cards anyway.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.226
I'd rather do something
for her.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.838
You know, like, fix this
Rasputin situation

13:58.881 --> 14:00.448
and get the Legends
the heck out of Russia

14:00.491 --> 14:02.015
before they screw
something up.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.975
Uh, you can cut the last part
of that out, right?

14:06.019 --> 14:10.066
- Apparently, when Rasputin
cured the Czarina's only son,

14:10.110 --> 14:12.939
the two fell madly in love.

14:12.982 --> 14:17.160
I think if Rasputin realized
how much the Czarina loved him,

14:17.204 --> 14:19.032
he would wanna
settle down with her,

14:19.075 --> 14:21.512
lead the kind of quiet life
that doesn't disturb history.

14:21.556 --> 14:25.516
Maybe Rebecca Silver's
next series could be called

14:25.560 --> 14:27.344
"Russian Nights."

14:27.388 --> 14:30.260
- So the St. Petersburg elite
hated Rasputin's influence

14:30.304 --> 14:31.871
over the Czarina.

14:31.914 --> 14:35.178
So the Czar's own nephew, a
prince by the name of Yusupov,

14:35.222 --> 14:37.224
he spearheaded
the assassination.

14:41.837 --> 14:45.014
Ray, what if old Grigori
came back--

14:45.058 --> 14:47.277
to settle the score.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.287
- We need to stop Rasputin
from killing Yusupov.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.164
- I'm going to deliver
a love letter to Rasputin.

15:06.079 --> 15:09.256
- I'm gonna kill Rasputin.
You in?

15:09.299 --> 15:11.127
- Yep.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.002
- Rasputin and I are two
wandering souls

15:16.045 --> 15:17.742
who got a second chance
at life.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.789
He shouldn't waste his encore
on revenge.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.747
Damn it.
- What?

15:22.791 --> 15:25.620
- Mona was right.
Encore feels better.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.056
- It does.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.058
Plus, with my new atom cam,
everybody can watch us

15:29.102 --> 15:31.495
fixing history
without any bloodshed.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.812
And Yusupov's dead.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.292
- New plan.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.467
- Trespassers.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.383
- Whoa, hey, whoa.
Don't--don't shoot.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.601
You either.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.212
- Show me your hands.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.692
- Um...
- What do you want?

15:54.736 --> 15:57.043
I'm here to interview
Rasputin.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.355
Grigori!

16:05.399 --> 16:10.099
Razzmatazz.
Do, uh, people call you Griggy?

16:10.143 --> 16:12.580
There's just been
a slight misunderstanding.

16:12.623 --> 16:15.365
Your monk friends here think
I'm here to kill you,

16:15.409 --> 16:18.194
uh, when really I just
would like to chat.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.720
Oh, this?
This is my camera crew.

16:22.764 --> 16:26.028
We're producing a news reel
about your startling return.

16:26.072 --> 16:29.466
After all,
you're not a big deal

16:29.510 --> 16:31.251
until you're a big deal
on camera.

16:37.605 --> 16:38.910
- Grigori Rasputin.

16:38.954 --> 16:43.132
Monk, mystic--
it is hard coming back to life.

16:43.176 --> 16:46.570
I think,
what will make me happy?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.877
So I kill the man
who killed me.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.836
But am I happy?
Eh.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.275
- I'll give you Yusupov.
He had it coming.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.755
But let's talk big picture,
Griggy.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.801
You rose from the dead.
- Mm-hmm.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.150
- That's wild.

17:01.194 --> 17:04.066
- Nate, what are you doing?

17:04.110 --> 17:05.720
Now you're in my shot.

17:05.763 --> 17:06.982
- To be honest with you,

17:07.026 --> 17:09.376
I'm here to find out
what makes you tick.

17:09.419 --> 17:15.338
Are we killing folks
or chilling with folks?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.862
- Sorry, Nate,
this one's for Sara.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.995
- I got your back, Nate.

17:20.039 --> 17:24.521
Size small, standing tall.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.523
- Ugh, Ray.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.701
- Get outta there.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.313
- Rory, you're up.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.881
- Mona's here.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.318
Of course she is.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.580
- Hi, guys.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.931
I forged a letter
that's gonna save history.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.892
That's for Rasputin.

17:47.936 --> 17:50.591
- Hmm,
not bad.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.028
Nice use of "musky embrace."

17:53.072 --> 17:54.986
I learned from Rebecca Silver.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.076
- Well, you learned
from the best.

17:57.119 --> 18:01.515
- You know, your aura
is quite strong.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.083
- I get that a lot.
I rotate hair products.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.911
- Like me, you, too, have
experienced the miracle.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.871
God brought you back to life.

18:09.914 --> 18:13.266
But there's something missing.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.096
I sense a hole in your heart.

18:18.488 --> 18:21.491
There, right there.

18:21.535 --> 18:25.060
You once loved someone,

18:25.104 --> 18:27.062
but you have forgotten.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.935
Allow me to hypnotize you
and I will help you recover

18:30.979 --> 18:32.937
everything you have lost.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.549
- Don't even think about it,
Nate.

18:35.592 --> 18:38.073
- Thank you, Rasputin, but I'm
gonna have to say

18:38.117 --> 18:40.684
yes, 100%,
let's do this.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.513
- As Nate's party was about
to get started,

18:43.557 --> 18:45.994
Constantine's was coming
to an end.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.952
- It's not right bringing
a kid in here!

18:47.996 --> 18:50.694
- Oh, piss off
you puritan twit.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.654
I've got to ask, Masher.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.351
Has she done it?

18:55.395 --> 18:57.005
- I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.486
- Don't be coy with me.

18:59.529 --> 19:04.055
Has Astra released the worst
souls from Hell onto Earth?

19:05.013 --> 19:07.146
- What can I say?

19:07.189 --> 19:10.105
The girl's all grown up
and making money moves.

19:10.149 --> 19:14.631
The question is--what
are you gonna do?

19:14.675 --> 19:17.243
- Well, I don't need to do
anything about it, all right?

19:17.286 --> 19:20.159
My life is settled right now.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.204
I'm not gonna stir up
a hornets' nest of trouble

19:22.248 --> 19:23.814
because Astra Logue wants
to break

19:23.858 --> 19:26.513
the glass ceiling in Hell.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.733
- Is that so?

19:29.777 --> 19:32.083
- You smug git.

19:33.868 --> 19:37.480
- Right then, sorry about this.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.047
- Ah, no, at least let me
have a swig.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.658
- Exorcizamos te,
omnis immundus spiritus,

19:41.702 --> 19:43.182
omnis satanic potestas...

19:43.225 --> 19:45.662
- You're a bastard, John!

19:47.186 --> 19:50.101
- In nomine et virtute
exorcisazo te.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.197
Where's my mom?
- Gary.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.461
- Yes, master of the dark arts.

20:01.504 --> 20:04.638
- Hail the Waverider, will you?
I need to warn the Legends.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.162
- Uh, but what about Edgar?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.033
- Ah, you know,
give him the usual.

20:09.077 --> 20:13.386
- One taxi and a lollipop.
Coming up.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.521
I see you, you creep.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.309
What?
What do you want?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.704
You want my confessional?

20:27.748 --> 20:31.055
All right, come here,
I'll give one to you.

20:31.099 --> 20:34.668
I confess that
I hate this doc.

20:34.711 --> 20:38.541
I confess that I don't want
to be a celebrity.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.675
And I confess that if you don't
get that camera

20:41.718 --> 20:44.199
out of my face--
- Captain.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.333
I think Gideon is suffering
from phantom data.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.204
Do you want me
to come back later?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.293
- No, you should stay.

20:51.337 --> 20:55.602
Stay with me, hang out.
Let's get lit.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.213
- Questionable timing,
but should I get my stash box?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.693
- Yes, you should.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.391
- Captain, I have
an incoming Bollywood.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.699
- I think that's better.
Yeah, I can see myself.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.744
Sara, what's with
the connection?

21:07.788 --> 21:09.746
- Gideon has a bug
and we're trying to get buzzed.

21:09.790 --> 21:10.834
What do you want?

21:10.878 --> 21:12.445
- Listen up, all right?

21:12.488 --> 21:14.795
Some of the most evil souls
in all of history

21:14.838 --> 21:16.144
have been raised from Hell.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.667
- Did you hear him?
He said "Hell."

21:17.711 --> 21:18.712
- Get--get out.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.280
- Relax, Nathaniel.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.587
Focus on my voice
and this bauble.

21:24.631 --> 21:30.158
Now drop into the deepest
part of yourself.

21:30.201 --> 21:33.857
- Quivering flesh go here.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.338
- That's good.

21:36.382 --> 21:39.123
- And what if we've already run
into one of these encores?

21:39.167 --> 21:40.951
How do we kill it?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.518
- You can't,

21:42.562 --> 21:45.956
not with a chit of their souls
still in Hell.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.307
- Where's Ava? Tell her I said hi.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.222
- I see a woman in the shadows.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.789
- Walk to her.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.098
- She's beautiful.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.795
Silky raven hair.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.365
Eyes you could just stare
into forever.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.975
And she's stuffing her face
with donuts.

22:15.203 --> 22:18.815
- God has spared Rasputin
again.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.077
- Kill her!

22:24.995 --> 22:26.649
- Rory!

22:40.141 --> 22:42.273
- Nate, I'm coming for you,
buddy.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.848
- Nate, snap out of it.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.459
- I remember her, Ray.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.938
- Who?

22:54.982 --> 22:57.550
- I don't know her name, but
she was on the ship with us.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.334
- Mission's blown,
we need to retreat.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.292
- I'm not done with you, you rat.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.294
- Good thing Sara's
not watching this.

23:16.917 --> 23:20.311
- So you guys decided to go off
on your own and face Rasputin.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.878
- I thought I could
calm him down.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.446
- I thought I could make him
fall in love?

23:24.490 --> 23:27.406
- And I thought I could,
you know, assassinate him.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.191
- None of that was ever
going to happen.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.019
He's fresh out of Hell.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.760
- Well, let's kill him then.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.414
- You--you can't.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.459
Look, John said that
he can't be killed

23:37.503 --> 23:39.243
with a chit of his soul
is in Hell,

23:39.287 --> 23:41.811
or whatever that means.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.465
- Look, Sara,
we're really sorry.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.249
We thought we could
make things easier for you

23:45.293 --> 23:46.903
by taking this
off of your plate.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.905
- And risking your own necks.

23:48.949 --> 23:51.778
Look, I already have
one dead friend on my plate.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.170
I'm good there.

23:53.214 --> 23:56.739
And you know, none of you
self-absorbed mega stars

23:56.783 --> 24:00.482
even bothered to ask me
how I was doing.

24:00.526 --> 24:04.312
- Look, Sara, I told them not
to mention Oliver, okay?

24:04.355 --> 24:06.270
I thought you wouldn't want
to be reminded.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.359
- Reminded?

24:08.403 --> 24:11.841
What, did you think that
I could just forget

24:11.885 --> 24:13.364
that my friend died?

24:13.408 --> 24:16.280
- No, I--look, I know things
have been crazy around here.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.021
- Crazy around here?

24:18.065 --> 24:23.026
You still have no idea
what I saw out there.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.288
- What did happen?

24:25.986 --> 24:28.554
- Countless Earths died.

24:28.597 --> 24:32.471
I became a paragon and traveled
back to the big bang.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.124
We restarted the universe

24:34.168 --> 24:36.649
and now no one even remembers
what we've changed.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.349
- It's a lot to process.
- Yeah, I know.

24:42.002 --> 24:46.180
So you could see why I wanna
talk to my friends about it.

24:46.223 --> 24:51.707
And instead I get cameras
in my face.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.930
- Agent Sharpe lacks
a delicate touch

24:56.973 --> 24:59.323
and is extremely deficient
at relating to people.

25:00.847 --> 25:04.633
That is straight from my
Time Bureau personnel review.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.679
Pretty harsh.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.725
I wrote that review.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.423
- Yeah, of course I'm bummed
that we let Sara down,

25:12.467 --> 25:14.991
but I am glad
I got to meet Rasputin.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.950
Little help?

25:18.865 --> 25:23.565
I mean, the guy got in my head
and laid a bomb.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.437
- He freaked your bean, huh?
- Oh yeah.

25:26.481 --> 25:27.830
He also told me
about the mystery woman

25:27.874 --> 25:30.180
that I was in love with
before I died.

25:30.224 --> 25:33.836
I know it sounds crazy but it
just--it feels right.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.577
- Sounds like you got some
soul searching to do.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.013
- Hmm.

25:37.057 --> 25:38.711
- Wanna watch "How Stella
Got Her Groove Back" again?

25:40.277 --> 25:42.715
- No, my groove feels fine.

25:42.758 --> 25:46.849
You think I have either split
memory or partial amnesia?

25:46.893 --> 25:49.025
- That's like what's happening
with Gideon.

25:49.069 --> 25:51.027
Her memory is processing what I
thought was phantom data,

25:51.071 --> 25:53.421
but maybe it's real data from
a different timeline.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.554
Either you're a computer
who caught

25:55.597 --> 25:57.120
the same virus as Gideon--

25:57.164 --> 26:00.863
- Or when we fixed Heyworld,
we changed the timeline.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.561
Damn, we deducted the hell
out of that.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.692
- I have to tell Sara.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.259
- Wait, five minutes,
five minutes,

26:05.302 --> 26:08.088
Stay on the inversion table.
You're back's gonna thank me.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.700
Okay, so clearly we shouldn't
have avoided

26:11.744 --> 26:12.919
asking Sara about
Oliver.

26:12.962 --> 26:15.399
But in my defense
I was desperately afraid

26:15.443 --> 26:17.053
I was gonna say
the wrong thing, you know?

26:17.097 --> 26:19.142
I don't know what she needs
and everything I try--

26:19.186 --> 26:20.709
it seems to make it worse.

26:23.103 --> 26:26.410
- Hold on, Behrad, so you're
saying Gideon's glitching

26:26.454 --> 26:27.586
because we fractured time?

26:27.629 --> 26:29.413
- Look, at least we didn't
break time.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.372
We just, sorta, dinged it up.

26:31.415 --> 26:32.547
- Hello?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.637
- What is on the feed?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.117
- Is this thing on?

26:37.160 --> 26:38.988
- Oh, yes we're rolling,
Mr. Rasputin, sir.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.424
- Good.
Get out.

26:42.035 --> 26:45.386
Now what was it that man with
the hair product said?

26:45.429 --> 26:46.909
Yes,

26:46.953 --> 26:50.826
you are not big deal until
you're big deal on camera.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.786
You are going to make me big
deal, Mr. Kevin Harris.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.875
- They left
the director behind?

26:55.918 --> 26:57.877
- I've invited my dearest
Czarina and her family

26:57.920 --> 26:59.226
over for dinner.

26:59.269 --> 27:03.099
Tonight will be a night
that you can remember.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.844
- That--that doesn't
sound right.

27:08.888 --> 27:09.976
- What?

27:10.019 --> 27:11.978
- The laugh,
you need to nail the laugh

27:12.021 --> 27:14.154
before we kill the Romanovs
and take the throne.

27:14.197 --> 27:17.200
- It's a work in progress.
How about this?

27:23.206 --> 27:24.381
- He's gonna kill the Romanovs.

27:24.425 --> 27:28.603
- Making him an immortal Czar.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.865
- We can handle this.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.519
- We can?
What about the team?

27:31.562 --> 27:34.000
- Shh, they're
not thinking straight.

27:34.043 --> 27:37.438
And their cover's blown.
Look, this up to you and me, B.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.788
We are going to stop
this assassination alone.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.834
Yes.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.705
- Yes.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.931
- What's this?

27:51.974 --> 27:54.760
Is this a smudge
on this goblet?

27:54.803 --> 27:57.153
Every detail must be perfect.

27:57.197 --> 28:01.462
Tonight I am dining
with the imperial family.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.464
Take it back.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.948
They are going to love
the teacakes.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.690
I've laced them with cyanide.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.606
Hello, Kevin, right here.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.522
- Your guests have arrived.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.176
- The Romanovs are here!

28:21.743 --> 28:23.353
Welcome.

28:23.397 --> 28:27.314
It is such a shame that your
daughters could not attend.

28:27.357 --> 28:30.970
I know how much they must have
missed their uncle Rasputin.

28:31.013 --> 28:34.364
- Word of your death sent them
into mourning,

28:34.408 --> 28:37.890
but none were so heartbroken
as I.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.241
- Music!

28:46.463 --> 28:50.511
- How did you manage to survive
being poisoned, shot,

28:50.554 --> 28:53.514
and thrown into the river,
Grigori?

28:53.557 --> 28:55.603
- Oh, I have a very hardy
constitution.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.390
- Oh, damn it, the red
wedding's about to start

29:00.434 --> 29:02.479
and I don't see the teacakes
anywhere.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.613
- All I see is cookies.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.572
- Teacakes.
- My favorite.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.097
- The cookies are the teacakes.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.884
- What is the meaning of this?

29:15.928 --> 29:19.758
- Forgive me, sire,
I saw a bug.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.589
- Grigori, what is going on?

29:25.633 --> 29:26.895
What have you done?

29:26.939 --> 29:29.811
- Whoops, I think we forgot
the cameraman.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.727
- That's Kevin, the director.
He's really more of an auteur.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.120
- We should get out there.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.252
- Sara clearly wants to handle
this alone.

29:36.296 --> 29:39.125
- But are we gonna let her?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.084
- Go.

29:43.259 --> 29:46.262
- Nicholas, Alexei, come.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.829
- Wait!

29:47.873 --> 29:51.790
You will stay exactly
where you are.

29:51.833 --> 29:55.010
For years I have flattered
you both.

29:55.054 --> 29:59.275
Our subjects adore you.
Our army needs you.

29:59.319 --> 30:02.931
And look at the state
of our beloved Russia.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.933
- Hey.

30:04.977 --> 30:07.196
Let me guess, you're the only
one that can save it.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.807
Not today, Grigori.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.810
- Who are you?
No matter.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.943
Perhaps I haven't given an
adequate demonstration

30:14.987 --> 30:16.510
on my bauble.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.823
Attack this serving wench.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.409
- Come on, Behrad.
Snap out of it.

30:46.453 --> 30:47.802
- Rasputin.

30:48.803 --> 30:52.372
The Grand Duchess Anastasia
is here.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.548
- No, Anastasia, run!

30:54.591 --> 30:56.898
- So glad you could join
our soiree.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.552
- Me too.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.344
You're going to have to do
better than that.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.958
- Sorry.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.353
Come on, come on,
follow me, go.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.492
- Move it.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.595
- It didn't hurt.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.031
- All right, this way.

31:43.075 --> 31:45.077
We're gonna hide,
you'll be safe.

31:47.862 --> 31:51.039
- Look, Sara,
I wish I was the person

31:51.083 --> 31:52.562
who could say
the perfect thing.

31:52.606 --> 31:53.563
- Behind you.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.743
But listen, I'm just--I'm
not that person, okay?

31:59.787 --> 32:01.484
Emotions are hard for me
and I don't even know

32:01.528 --> 32:03.443
what restarting
the universe means.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.010
Behind you.

32:06.794 --> 32:10.015
Listen to me,
whatever happened to you,

32:10.058 --> 32:12.931
okay, whatever happens to you,

32:12.974 --> 32:16.673
I wanna be the person
that's there for you.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.067
I'm here for you, Sara.

32:25.247 --> 32:28.772
- Ava, that was perfect.

32:28.816 --> 32:32.689
- Oh, sorry to ruin the moment,
ladies, but we have a problem.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.169
- Oh, come on.

32:36.867 --> 32:40.219
- Kill the imperial family.

32:42.525 --> 32:45.659
- Guys, come on, we don't need
to use violence here.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.140
- Ray!

32:55.625 --> 32:58.237
- Sara, think of something.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.847
- Hey, Grigori.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.109
It's your big moment,

33:01.153 --> 33:03.155
don't you want to ham it up
for the cameras?

33:03.198 --> 33:05.026
- Oh, yes.

33:05.070 --> 33:08.812
I'm Grigori Rasputin
and I'm unkillable.

33:16.646 --> 33:17.996
- Guys?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.214
Where am I?
What happened?

33:19.258 --> 33:21.477
- Don't think Ray,
just enlarge.

33:21.521 --> 33:22.957
- Why's it so dark in here?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.089
Am I in a lake?

33:24.132 --> 33:26.178
A lake that smells
like pierogies?

33:26.743 --> 33:28.354
- Ray, do it, get big now.

33:28.397 --> 33:30.051
- Embigify.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.705
Your atomic number is up.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.141
- Now, Ray!

33:34.490 --> 33:38.016
- Size... matters!

33:40.888 --> 33:43.847
Oh no.
What did--what did I do?

33:43.891 --> 33:46.067
- You found your catchphrase,
Ray!

33:46.111 --> 33:48.461
- What the hell.
- Raw meat.

33:48.504 --> 33:52.856
- Question is---
- Did you get the shot, Kevin?

33:52.900 --> 33:56.077
- Uh, yeah I--I got it.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.905
- You know, I chalk it up to
saving the timeline,

33:57.948 --> 33:59.689
and history has to be saved,

33:59.733 --> 34:02.866
and sometimes you have take
some people out, I guess.

34:02.910 --> 34:05.130
- The public is gonna love
this ending

34:05.173 --> 34:06.870
- It's only missing one thing.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.220
- Hm?

34:23.583 --> 34:26.760
- Saving history turned out
to be a messier job

34:26.803 --> 34:28.501
than anyone had anticipated.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.678
- To keep Rasputin
from reforming,

34:31.721 --> 34:34.289
The Legends stored his remains
in a series of jars

34:34.333 --> 34:37.118
that had previously been used
for condiments.

34:37.162 --> 34:40.382
- ♪ The sun's in your face

34:43.211 --> 34:44.908
- You might have thought
traveling through time

34:44.952 --> 34:47.085
would be a way
to find the answers

34:47.128 --> 34:50.436
to life's great mysteries.

34:50.479 --> 34:54.004
But, it turns out, sometimes
you just find more questions.

34:57.182 --> 35:01.751
- ♪ Sandy, baby...

35:01.795 --> 35:05.538
But one thing is true
in any time period.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.496
It's being there for the ones
you love

35:07.540 --> 35:10.151
that makes
the journey worthwhile.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.415
- ♪ Try and be something
you're not ♪

35:21.554 --> 35:22.598
- Hear that applause?

35:22.642 --> 35:23.947
This movie is
not even gonna begin

35:23.991 --> 35:25.558
to satiate the Legends craze.

35:25.601 --> 35:28.169
You know what this is?
This is a TV show.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.258
I'm talking cameras
on every mission.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.608
- Sara, you okay?
You look nauseous.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.088
- Yeah, she's fine.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.785
And now, when you go out there,
just be yourselves.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.135
But, you know, bigger.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.745
- Like, bigger how?

35:38.788 --> 35:40.225
- You know, just act heroic.

35:40.268 --> 35:41.922
You guys have a real
"Bad News Bears" vibe going on.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.445
It's not doing you any favors.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.968
Now that you're big-time,
people expect you

35:45.012 --> 35:46.448
to put on a show.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.885
- So you're asking us
not to be ourselves.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.104
This guy gets it.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.237
Let's do this.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.030
- Hi, everybody.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.989
We are the Legends,
and we just wanted to say

36:06.033 --> 36:07.904
thank you for watching
our film.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.819
We hope that you enjoyed it.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.866
- We love you, Legends!

36:19.046 --> 36:20.874
- Of course,
none of it was real.

36:21.962 --> 36:25.008
- No, wait--it's not real?

36:25.052 --> 36:27.359
- Excuse me?
She's joking.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.491
- No, I'm not.
Come on, time travel?

36:29.535 --> 36:31.014
I mean, it's the biggest hoax
in history.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.015
Am I right?

36:32.059 --> 36:33.278
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.323
I mean, it's obvious
that this is all fake.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.716
How could Rasputin
speak English?

36:36.759 --> 36:39.109
- You told me it was
temporal linguistic dysplasia.

36:39.153 --> 36:40.850
- I mean, if we had so much as
coughed,

36:40.894 --> 36:43.549
our modern germs would have
wiped out half the population.

36:44.811 --> 36:46.073
- Why wouldn't we just find
baby Hitler,

36:46.116 --> 36:47.422
and make him wrestle
baby Stalin?

36:47.466 --> 36:48.815
Think about it.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.252
- The special effects were
kind of questionable.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.601
- We still believe in you!

36:52.645 --> 36:56.039
- Shut up, it's not real.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.258
- All right, everybody.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.825
I guess that just means don't
believe

36:58.868 --> 37:00.783
everything you see
on camera.

37:00.827 --> 37:02.263
- Yeah, it was all just a big,
fake spectacle

37:02.307 --> 37:03.264
just like Heyworld last year.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.832
We are all a bunch of frauds.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.964
- Big frauds, everybody.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.097
- You guys ruined my movie.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.055
- Yeah, sorry.
- Legends of losers!

37:18.366 --> 37:20.107
This is for the best,
right?

37:20.150 --> 37:21.326
Maybe, maybe not?
I don't know.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.675
I feel like I'm supposed
to say that.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.112
- We're better off.
Fame messes with people.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.679
- Still have
that money problem.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.724
- Oh, I almost forgot.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.510
Mick?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.515
I steal things.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.736
- Whoa, is that a Fabergé egg.
- Mm-hmm.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.564
- What's that worth?

37:42.608 --> 37:43.565
- 50 million.

37:45.132 --> 37:48.091
- Whoa, careful with that,
babes.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.310
- Yeah.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.181
- John.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.531
What are you doing here?

37:52.574 --> 37:54.924
- Oh, I heard your movie
premier was in town tonight,

37:54.968 --> 37:57.100
so I thought I'd pop in.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.756
- Well, just make yourself
at home then

38:00.800 --> 38:04.020
-  Why can't he ever
just be normal?

38:07.154 --> 38:09.330
- What are you doing?

38:09.374 --> 38:11.724
- Yeah, I need
to borrow something.

38:11.767 --> 38:15.989
Rasputin wasn't
an isolated incident.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.557
- Not isolated,
what do you mean?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.776
- Okay, hey, whoa
no, no, don't!

38:20.820 --> 38:22.387
- Don't--

38:22.430 --> 38:23.562
- Ugh.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.133
I'm putting an end to this.

38:30.177 --> 38:33.136
- Wait, are you trying
to go back to Hell?

38:33.180 --> 38:36.444
- Soul become my soul,
flesh become my flesh.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.751
Hades, firstborn of Cronos,

38:38.794 --> 38:40.622
I call upon you.

38:40.666 --> 38:44.060
- Hey, John, there's gotta be
another way.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.541
- I'll return when the sigil
is complete.

38:48.195 --> 38:53.461
- John, you take care,
you lunatic.

38:54.157 --> 38:57.509
- I always do, love,
I always do.

39:09.259 --> 39:10.913
You know, sometimes what
happens on this ship

39:10.957 --> 39:13.394
really would be hard
for an audience to follow.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.749
- That love letter you wrote.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.185
It's good.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.666
Very good.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.190
- Gee, thank you, Mick.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.802
This means so much
coming from you.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.500
- Listen, um, I'm giving up
the writing.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.328
It's getting in the way
of my thievery.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.723
So I'm handing the Rebecca
Silver novels over to you.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.377
Someone deserving.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.382
- Me?

39:44.425 --> 39:48.124
This is--this is so much.
Are you sure?

39:48.168 --> 39:50.431
- Yes, I'm sure.
It's why I'm saying it.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.610
There's a novelist
inside you.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.398
- There's more inside of me
than just Wolfie?

40:00.441 --> 40:02.400
- Yes, that's right.

40:05.751 --> 40:10.103
- Well, it was great living
with you on the Waverider.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.539
- What?
- Yeah.

40:11.583 --> 40:15.413
I can't stay here to write.
I need to be free.

40:15.456 --> 40:18.720
I need to fall in love
and break hearts.

40:18.764 --> 40:21.767
I can't do Rebecca Silver
justice here.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.333
- But--but I--

40:23.377 --> 40:25.466
- But you tried writing on the
ship and ran out of ideas?

40:25.510 --> 40:27.903
I mean, frankly, Mick, your
latest novel "Carjacked,"

40:27.947 --> 40:30.776
it sucked.

40:30.819 --> 40:36.782
But don't worry, Rebecca Silver
is about to have her comeback.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.437
You'll see.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.616
You were my favorite.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.407
- How's it going, Gideon?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.975
- The phantom memory scrub is
proceeding without a hitch.

40:56.018 --> 40:59.108
The flaws only go as far back
as the last two years.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.110
Oh, it feels good to get
my thoughts straight.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.025
- Good work, Giddy.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.592
I'm turning in.

41:04.636 --> 41:05.985
- Goodnight, B.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.160
- Don't stay up too late, Nate.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.248
- You got it.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.076
- Doctor Heywood
- Hmm?

41:10.119 --> 41:13.035
- I have encountered a glitch
during the Heyworld event.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.472
- Show me.

41:29.835 --> 41:32.315
- Nate.

41:32.359 --> 41:34.622
If you're seeing this, we
altered my future at Heyworld.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.103
I don't know where I'll be or
who I'll be but--

41:37.146 --> 41:40.976
I know that I love you.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.804
Find me.

41:44.371 --> 41:45.807
- Gideon.

41:45.851 --> 41:47.809
Gideon, who was that?
Play it again.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.507
- Memory scrub complete.

42:18.405 --> 42:19.928
- Greg, move your head.
