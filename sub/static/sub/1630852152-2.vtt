WEBVTT

00:17.727 --> 00:19.353
Félix, let's go.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.628
TAYRONA NATIONAL PARK

00:55.181 --> 00:56.932
TAYRONA + CADAVER + ISRAELI

00:56.974 --> 00:58.851
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR YOUR SEARCH

02:22.476 --> 02:23.561
Not now.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.437
Answer. It's Félix.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.068
Hello?

02:31.110 --> 02:32.528
Look at what I sent you.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.994
FIVE COMPANIES GET QUOTA
TO GROW CANNABIS IN COLOMBIA

02:44.248 --> 02:48.544
"KannaLab has amazed everyone, as a company
that enters the big leagues

02:48.586 --> 02:49.837
with a different

02:49.879 --> 02:50.713
and innovative vision.

02:50.754 --> 02:51.922
Hey,

02:51.964 --> 02:54.550
didn't we send a picture
of the three of us?

02:54.592 --> 02:57.136
Yeah, we sent a few.
But they chose that one.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.638
Ignacio won't like that one bit.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.307
Who cares what he says, Mari.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.018
What's important is that
we're in the big leagues.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.355
I can't believe this
is happening.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.941
It's like a dream, right?

04:33.232 --> 04:36.026
Mari, why don't we go
to Cartagena this weekend?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.321
To Cartagena?

04:39.363 --> 04:42.616
Yes. We haven't gotten
away in a while.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.955
No. You have no idea
how much work I have this week.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.833
Okay, forget this weekend.
We can go next week instead.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.126
Even worse.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.294
We have a ton of lab tests.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.424
Then, when will you
be available?

05:00.801 --> 05:01.593
What's that?

05:02.011 --> 05:02.553
Yeah.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.473
If this keeps up, I won't
see my wife until Christmas.

05:08.225 --> 05:11.645
What are you talking about? Aren't
we here, talking right now?

05:11.687 --> 05:14.648
No. I'm talking to you.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.608
You're chatting with your ex,
Félix.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.027
With my business partner.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.319
I don't care.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.865
Is Lucas Sandoval jealous?

05:22.906 --> 05:26.368
Wow! That sure is something new.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.704
When did my husband get swapped?

05:30.039 --> 05:33.000
When you started talking more
about marijuana

05:33.042 --> 05:34.752
than anything else.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.754
It's "cannabis".
"Marijuana" is racist.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.465
I don't give a fuck.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.424
Do you know the origin?
From "María"

05:40.466 --> 05:42.384
and "Juana".

05:42.426 --> 05:47.097
The Americans made it up to stigmatize
cannabis and make it sound Mexican.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.891
Because it corrupted white women

05:48.932 --> 05:51.727
so the bad Mexicans
could seduce them.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.021
Why are you lecturing me

05:54.063 --> 05:55.647
on marijuana if I'm talking...

05:55.689 --> 05:57.274
It's called cannabis.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.401
I'm talking about
your ex-boyfriend, Félix.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.908
It was precisely Félix, my
ex-boyfriend and business partner,

06:05.949 --> 06:09.953
who told me this about cannabis,
and I'm passing it on

06:10.829 --> 06:12.581
to my husband,

06:12.623 --> 06:14.708
who I love with all my heart,

06:14.750 --> 06:17.795
and who turned out to be
a bit jealous.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.674
Listen,

06:24.968 --> 06:27.179
I married the man I love.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.389
Félix is just a friend.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.892
What type of friend is he?

06:32.810 --> 06:34.436
Why? Are there categories now?

06:34.478 --> 06:35.270
Of course.

06:36.522 --> 06:39.483
There are friends you
don't see in years,

06:39.525 --> 06:41.527
and when you see them,
it's like a day went by.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.363
Others, you don't see in a day,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.490
and it feels like years went by.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.617
So, yes. There are
different kinds.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.172
Mariana!

07:02.214 --> 07:03.048
- Hello.
- Graciela Arbeláez.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.385
You're the CEO of Madre Verde,
right?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.011
It's a pleasure to meet you.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.598
Congratulations on getting the permit
to cultivate cannabis.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.351
Thank you.

07:14.393 --> 07:14.935
How kind.

07:16.145 --> 07:18.438
I'm very sorry you didn't
get the permit.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.774
Are you actually sorry?

07:23.068 --> 07:24.361
Excuse me?

07:24.403 --> 07:26.238
How do you know where I live?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.739
That's not relevant.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.241
Yes, it is.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.244
What would you think
if I showed up at your door?

07:32.286 --> 07:34.705
I'd think you have something
important to tell me.

07:38.125 --> 07:38.876
Oh, I see.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.671
You're here to buy the permit
to plant cannabis.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.089
It's not for sale.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.382
Don't fool yourself.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.135
Everything has a price.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.137
How much?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.140
Three million dollars?

08:01.231 --> 08:02.608
Thank you very much

08:02.649 --> 08:05.986
for your generous offer.
We're not for sale.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.237
Thank you for the gift.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.615
Shouldn't you consult
with your father?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.241
My father isn't involved.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.826
Then consult your partners.

08:12.868 --> 08:16.163
Actually, I don't need to
consult anyone.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.414
Really, Mariana?

08:17.456 --> 08:19.541
Even the president
consults his wife.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.795
You know what? You remind me of myself
when I started

08:23.837 --> 08:26.215
and I ruined
everything I touched.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.175
I had to learn a lot.

08:28.717 --> 08:29.718
Yeah?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.095
And what did you learn?

08:32.137 --> 08:35.057
Your company's investing
hundreds of millions of dollars

08:35.098 --> 08:37.935
and you couldn't even get a
permit to grow your product.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.144
Here's some advice.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.437
I don't need your advice.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.813
Sell

08:41.855 --> 08:43.941
before you fall back
down to earth,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.443
because the fall will be big.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.488
Have a nice day.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.189
Susana.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.483
How's irrigation?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.069
There's a problem.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.030
We can barely get any water.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.827
The problem isn't the water.
Look. The canals aren't aligned.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.704
In all the time I've
worked on this,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.914
this is the first time
they've restricted water.

09:40.956 --> 09:45.294
When this crop grows, we'll need ten
times the water we're using now.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.046
If we're not careful now,
this will all be a big waste.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.257
- We have to look at every detail.
- Yeah.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.259
The devil's in the details.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.261
Now you want to talk
about religion?

09:57.055 --> 09:57.931
What?

09:57.973 --> 09:58.849
What's wrong?

09:58.890 --> 10:00.809
I have good and bad news.

10:00.851 --> 10:01.768
Let's see.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.979
The bad news

10:04.021 --> 10:05.814
is that all the other companies

10:05.856 --> 10:08.525
are already performing THC and CBD
extraction tests.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.902
This means that,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.196
if we don't start now,
we'll fall behind.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.073
- And the good news?
- The good news

10:15.115 --> 10:18.410
is that the equipment supplier
is ready to ship.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.661
We just need the money.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.997
Just the money.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.040
Doll face.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.958
Urgent meeting.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.504
Which one do you like more
for this wall?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.341
This is the urgent meeting?

10:32.382 --> 10:34.092
Yes. Image is everything.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.887
Whoever walks into this office
immediately has to see

10:36.928 --> 10:39.222
we're the future, or we're screwed.
Which one?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.851
So some wallpaper's going to
determine our future, or what?

10:42.893 --> 10:45.479
Just tell me which one you like more.
Choose one.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.274
I don't know.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.609
- This one.
- That one?

10:51.777 --> 10:53.653
Okay, then we'll use this one.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.113
So why'd you ask me?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.323
To rule it out.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.283
Do whatever you want
with the wall.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.369
There's more important
stuff to discuss.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.578
- Like what?
- Like what?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.413
Like we don't have any money?

11:03.455 --> 11:06.541
We have to expand the lab and
improve the irrigation system.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.960
That's it?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.295
You want more?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.964
No, relax. I solved the problem
with the money.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.008
Yesterday, the bank
approved our loan.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.095
We just have to sign some papers
and get the transfer.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.888
A loan? In exchange for what?

11:21.848 --> 11:22.766
Impossible.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.893
But it's a fair offer.

11:24.935 --> 11:28.730
Fair? If we don't pay, the bank will
take all of my land. How's that fair?

11:28.772 --> 11:31.191
To make money
we have to take risks, right?

11:31.233 --> 11:34.111
Sure, risk other
people's property.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.780
I didn't confront my dad so the bank
could take my land, sorry.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.281
Oh, you're sorry?

11:38.323 --> 11:41.827
Didn't I risk all my money
a few months back at Tayrona?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.078
Remember that?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.162
Yes, I do.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.622
That worked out, didn't it?

11:46.623 --> 11:48.500
Okay, so what'll we do?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.712
In fact, I was going to show you
the company strategy.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.756
Show? To who? Your employees?

11:54.798 --> 11:57.634
I didn't know you were
the queen of this empire.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.219
We're all supposed to plan it.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.012
Yes, but it's not happening,
is it?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.347
Someone had to do it.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.350
Ignacio's been obsessing
over the office for weeks,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.727
you're working hard
with the crops,

12:07.769 --> 12:09.438
and this is more financial...

12:09.479 --> 12:11.231
Financial?

12:11.273 --> 12:13.733
If you didn't get the hint,
she doesn't trust...

12:13.775 --> 12:15.110
Thank you, Nachito.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.446
So which meetings will I attend?

12:17.487 --> 12:18.947
- The ones on farming.
- No.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.824
- On fertilizers, manure.
- That's not

12:20.866 --> 12:23.243
what I meant.

12:23.285 --> 12:27.080
We haven't even started and we've
already had our own Red Wedding.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.458
God save the queen.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.710
Isn't the queen
negotiating with the bank

12:31.751 --> 12:32.794
behind our backs?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.838
That is betrayal.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.592
I'm just getting ahead on work
we had to do anyway.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.052
According to the dictionary,
betrayal is an act

12:41.094 --> 12:43.430
that breaks the trust or loyalty

12:43.472 --> 12:44.890
you must keep

12:44.931 --> 12:45.932
or have.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.190
They chose the picture, not me.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.402
- Are we supposed to believe that?
- It's the truth.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.655
I think you wanted to appear alone
in the magazine.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.116
You know I'm not the enemy,
right?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.327
I'm not the enemy, either.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.913
- Then stop acting like you are.
- Okay.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.956
Let's start over, okay?

13:09.998 --> 13:10.874
You agree?

13:10.916 --> 13:11.541
- It's hard.
- Why's it hard?

13:13.251 --> 13:16.379
Because we know, you know, that we
know you didn't count on us.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.465
Fuck it. We're starting over,
Nacho.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.217
No, I'm a being of light,

13:20.258 --> 13:21.551
transparent.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.387
I just need to know
no one's gonna backstab me

13:24.429 --> 13:25.555
when I'm sleeping.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.140
I'm not hiding anything.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.600
Anything else you wanna say?

13:30.644 --> 13:31.811
No? Okay.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.605
- And you?
- No.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.856
Actually, yes.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.651
I changed the company logo.
I didn't like it.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.946
Okay, I can live with that.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.449
What's important is, where are
we gonna get the money we need?

13:45.408 --> 13:47.953
Can I talk now?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.454
Excuse me, guys.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.916
I have an idea. I was going to
show it to you today.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.753
We'll have an open house.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.802
- Open house?
- It'll be unique.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.054
The coolest, most original party
ever celebrated here.

14:07.639 --> 14:11.434
Here? What about the crops?
And the mother plants' safety?

14:11.476 --> 14:13.353
No, I mean here.

14:13.395 --> 14:17.023
Nobody will be near the plants.
But we can reinforce security.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.404
Sounds cool.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.032
We could give out
samples of our weed.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.076
Exactly.

14:34.791 --> 14:35.875
What do you say?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.588
Okay, but I'll make
the guest list.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.006
We'll only invite people

14:41.047 --> 14:43.216
that can invest,
but for real,

14:43.258 --> 14:45.719
not a ton of bums
who'll come to eat for free

14:45.760 --> 14:47.012
and take pictures.

14:47.053 --> 14:47.846
Agreed?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.016
You keep the finances, and you

14:51.683 --> 14:52.601
keep going.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.249
Lola?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.125
No.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.638
Sorry.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.396
Please, let's not talk about prejudice
in this interview.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.358
Like what kind of prejudice?

15:41.399 --> 15:45.654
Like the idea that a journalist has to
look like a cheap game show host.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.409
Would you like a drink, or...?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.454
Hey, buddy. Yes, an espresso,

15:54.496 --> 15:57.165
and another one in five minutes,
please.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.750
Better if it's Lavazza.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.378
Do you want something?

16:01.419 --> 16:02.796
A normal coffee.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.089
Better if it's Colombian.

16:10.887 --> 16:11.930
Can we start?

16:11.971 --> 16:12.889
To talk about you?

16:13.932 --> 16:14.808
Yes.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.601
That's why we're here, right?

16:17.519 --> 16:18.770
Let's talk about KannaLab first.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.730
Perfect.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.150
This Friday, we'll have an open house
to find investors.

16:24.192 --> 16:28.446
You can come if you want to see the
place and talk to the other partners.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.742
I'd rather go through labor than
go to one of those snobby parties.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.120
Tell me about KannaLab.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.204
How'd you start?

16:38.915 --> 16:40.375
We're three partners

16:40.417 --> 16:43.211
and eight months ago,
it was Mariana's birthday.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.546
On March 8, to be exact,

16:45.880 --> 16:48.216
and we hadn't seen each other
in a long time.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.092
Where?

16:53.763 --> 16:54.973
Here, in Bogotá.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.976
Félix had been
working for months

16:58.017 --> 17:00.520
with the plants
and he had the perfect seed.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.648
The ideal seed, the only thing we
needed to get started.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.817
Why cannabis?

17:07.152 --> 17:10.447
Because we're doing
what no one else is doing.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.115
What are you doing?

17:14.993 --> 17:16.953
Revolutionizing the worldwide
cannabis industry.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.998
People need to know
and understand

17:20.039 --> 17:24.210
how ridiculous and absurd it is to
prohibit something that helps so many.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.717
What does your
grandfather think?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.763
What's he got to do with this?

17:34.804 --> 17:38.475
He's the ex-president who began the
war against drugs in this country.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.268
He must have something to say.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.688
Ask him, if you're so interested
in his opinion.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.356
I'm asking you,

17:45.398 --> 17:48.234
as a Santamaría, someone who
grows under the shadow

17:48.276 --> 17:51.196
of one of the most important men
in Colombian politics.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.198
I'm not associated
with that family.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.034
You have the same last name.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.744
You take your name to the grave.

17:57.786 --> 18:01.080
I'm here thanks to what I achieved
on my own, not my last name.

18:02.957 --> 18:03.625
Let me refresh your memory.

18:05.627 --> 18:09.214
If you hadn't studied where you did,
which was paid for by your family,

18:09.255 --> 18:12.091
you wouldn't know the owner
of the newspaper I work for,

18:12.133 --> 18:13.051
and I wouldn't be here.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.722
Meritocracy isn't a core pillar
of your life, Santamaría.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.644
What kind of interview do you think
you'll get with that attitude?

18:22.685 --> 18:25.021
Honestly, I think we're
wasting our time.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.316
Finally something we
can agree on.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.492
Should I take the gentleman's,
or...?

18:37.534 --> 18:39.035
Leave it here.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.161
I want to try it.

19:11.442 --> 19:12.944
Coffee

19:12.986 --> 19:14.612
and flowers

19:14.654 --> 19:16.990
are in the past.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.075
The real product,

19:19.117 --> 19:21.286
the star Colombian product

19:21.327 --> 19:22.662
- is cannabis, coffee...
- Mariana.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.208
The two biggest coffee exporters
in the country are coming,

19:27.250 --> 19:29.168
so I'd cut back on the speech,
okay?

19:29.210 --> 19:30.169
Okay.

19:30.211 --> 19:30.795
There'll also be

19:31.921 --> 19:34.299
seven bankers, two stock
exchange owners,

19:34.340 --> 19:36.634
and a dozen Elon Musk wannabes.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.888
One of these aristo-hippies
has to drop a million dollars.

19:39.929 --> 19:44.142
Doll face, first we'll drain
the big pus-filled pimples.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.518
Who else is coming?

19:45.560 --> 19:48.104
Aníbal Restrepo, ex-banker,

19:48.146 --> 19:51.232
ex-congressman,
and the president's ex-lover.

19:51.274 --> 19:54.569
That porn star 'stache
is worth $90 million.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.196
Carla Espitia, CEO of
Gran Pharma.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.282
They want to diversify,

19:59.324 --> 20:03.077
and by that, I mean they've set up a business
incubator that's as useless

20:03.119 --> 20:05.371
as a panda trying to mate.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.333
Hernán Arce,
film and television producer.

20:08.374 --> 20:12.837
I fall asleep during all of his
movies, but the French love him.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.089
They call him
"the Maluma of art house films,"

20:15.131 --> 20:17.717
and I still don't know
what the fuck that means.

20:17.759 --> 20:22.305
So, darlings, put on your heels,
and let's dance.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.723
It's only a million dollars.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.188
You know perfectly well

20:30.229 --> 20:32.941
that I'm no charlatan,
no snake oil salesman.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.400
That's not me.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.194
But you are a bit of
a charlatan.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.612
That's called charm.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.615
What I want you to know

20:40.657 --> 20:43.034
is that we have the business
of the future.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.787
Nowadays, Colombia's
true star product

20:45.828 --> 20:47.830
is without a doubt cannabis.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.877
Everyone knows our country
doesn't need PR.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.713
The narcos already built
the brand, right?

20:55.755 --> 20:59.550
We have to turn that around
and use it in our favor.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.804
Now we just have to make people know
that it's legal.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.099
Nicole Kidman fell in
love with Colombia.

21:06.140 --> 21:10.520
That makes four Hollywood movies
this year.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.771
Wow.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.898
So it's the perfect
moment to diversify.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.860
This cannabis will revolutionize
the industry.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.862
How can you assure me

21:19.904 --> 21:22.657
that all this cannabis talk
isn't just a new trend?

21:22.699 --> 21:26.327
Well, it isn't new. The
market has existed for years.

21:26.369 --> 21:30.039
We're not making it up. We
just have to make that change.

21:30.081 --> 21:32.125
Company value is skyrocketing.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.002
Who's valuing it?

21:34.043 --> 21:36.170
The gods of Olympus?

21:36.212 --> 21:40.174
Actually, I heard Zeus and Hades have
been calling all morning, you know.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.178
No, this is real.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.847
And now's your chance.

21:45.888 --> 21:50.518
I'll be honest. I don't think my team
is ready for this change.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.730
Okay.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.898
But you can give them
the information.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.275
Of course.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.735
But I know them well.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.864
Nachito,
we just came to have a look.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.117
This thing you got here,

22:07.201 --> 22:08.703
it's impressive!

22:08.745 --> 22:11.539
Yes, it took a lot of hard work.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.750
Right. I wanted to tell you

22:14.834 --> 22:16.836
about the new movie
we're producing.

22:16.878 --> 22:21.382
The thing is, we need more money
to finance it.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.135
Nicole Kidman wants
to reshoot some scenes,

22:24.177 --> 22:26.554
and we thought
Colombia's the best option.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.097
What do you say?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.433
Are you in?

22:41.569 --> 22:46.783
- Is it recreational cannabis? -No,
Colombia approved medicinal exports.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.076
So? Nobody will get
high on this?

22:48.659 --> 22:50.369
Not with this.

22:50.411 --> 22:54.916
This has been processed. The THC
levels are low and it's mainly CBD.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.334
Let me try the good stuff.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.086
Before it's processed.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.927
Ladies first.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.970
No, I don't smoke.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.680
Really?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.432
Like a tattoo artist
without tattoos.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.666
Yeah, it's good.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.001
But why's this the biggest shit?

23:42.463 --> 23:44.048
Look at the trichomes.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.968
The terpenes and cannabinoids
are stored there.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.929
And I swear a concentration like this
is unbeatable.

23:49.971 --> 23:52.056
What the fuck are terpenes?

23:52.098 --> 23:56.978
Terpenes and cannabinoids give the flavor,
smell, medicinal effect, and the high.

23:58.229 --> 24:01.732
The best seeds give
the most stable results,

24:01.774 --> 24:06.028
when the THC and CBD levels are
continuous, and when the lab--

24:06.070 --> 24:07.864
I'm not a fucking laboratory.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.824
Talk to me like I'm your aunt.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.951
This is the best weed
you'll ever smoke.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.871
It's like being on a tropical beach
and feeling

24:14.912 --> 24:17.957
the wind, the smell of
a pine forest

24:18.875 --> 24:21.502
running through your veins.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.797
It's like breathing something
purer than oxygen.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.340
Yeah, it's the shit.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.386
But a 25% return is crap
for such a big risk.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.846
- We can negotiate that.
- No.

24:31.888 --> 24:32.847
If I'm in, I want to
be a partner.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.435
I get 40% of the company
and you divide the rest.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.354
We divide the rest?
Like dogs fighting over scraps?

24:40.396 --> 24:42.940
If you're talking with me,
it means you got shit.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.068
So you either fight over the scraps,
or leave it.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.173
Thanks.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.807
Do you think we're
doing this right?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.602
I think we are.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.270
We're not the problem here.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.651
If you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.402
My mom used to say that.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.823
You know she'd be proud
of what you're achieving, right?

25:33.950 --> 25:35.284
Well,

25:35.326 --> 25:38.621
I risked the only crop she loved,
and for what?

25:39.080 --> 25:40.331
For what?

25:40.373 --> 25:43.125
We're changing people's lives.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.378
Really, two months ago,

25:45.419 --> 25:48.798
people in Colombia thought
cannabis was a vice,

25:48.839 --> 25:52.009
but now that idea is
falling apart.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.262
We're opening their eyes.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.680
Yeah?

25:55.721 --> 25:58.349
You really think we're
changing lives?

25:59.850 --> 26:00.726
Well,

26:01.727 --> 26:03.187
at least ours have changed.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.400
Or is your life the
same as before?

26:09.694 --> 26:13.155
It's not like before,
but this new version of my life

26:13.197 --> 26:15.449
distanced me a lot from my dad.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.702
That doesn't matter.
The crop's yours.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.079
You can do whatever you
want with it.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.581
Yes, but he's still angry

26:22.623 --> 26:26.127
that his daughter humiliated him
in front of everyone.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.671
Look on the bright side.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.382
You're done dealing with him.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.342
Actually, I'm not.

26:33.384 --> 26:37.930
Over half of the other crops are
mine. I should go to the meetings,

26:37.972 --> 26:40.641
but I don't want to show
my face there.

26:40.683 --> 26:45.479
Know what? Next time you have a meeting,
take some of our weed.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.024
Imagine your dad high?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.609
No way.
That old man.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.700
Things will get better, right?

27:00.286 --> 27:02.121
I'm sure they will.

27:04.165 --> 27:07.668
Me too. I feel it.
We're going to be on the top".

27:34.695 --> 27:35.780
Félix.

27:36.739 --> 27:37.782
- What's up?
- Everything good?

27:39.158 --> 27:42.119
Could I get two glasses of red wine,
please?

27:43.454 --> 27:45.331
Mari's very excited
about all this.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.124
She deserves it. She
worked hard.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.586
She's happier than ever.

27:51.796 --> 27:55.132
It's like something
changed inside her.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.260
She always wanted her
own company.

27:59.261 --> 27:59.970
No.

28:00.638 --> 28:01.847
I think it's more.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.059
It must be motherhood.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.439
Mariana's pregnant?

28:10.481 --> 28:11.899
Not yet,

28:11.941 --> 28:14.527
but we're trying,
and she's looking forward to it.

28:16.070 --> 28:19.865
It's like this company gave her
the stability she needed.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.743
Cheer up, you'll be an uncle.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.539
You're like the brother
she never had.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.294
Hey! I'm happy you made it.

28:34.004 --> 28:37.091
I brought Ximena,
the owner's daughter.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.676
Ximena Casas?
She's here?

28:38.717 --> 28:42.221
- She's loaded and I'll introduce you.
- That's great. Perfect.

28:43.264 --> 28:44.056
Xime.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.684
- Hello.
- This is Mariana.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.102
- Hello.
- Mari,

28:48.144 --> 28:50.896
- it's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- My pleasure.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.106
Lucas told me about you.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.983
- I hope it was all good.
- Yes.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.693
All good things.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.946
He talks like a man in love, the
kind that doesn't exist anymore.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.617
- Meet Félix, one of my partners.
- It's a pleasure.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.952
How are you?

29:04.994 --> 29:08.831
Everyone's talking about
your wonderful cannabis.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.082
It took a lot of work.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.043
It's a unique plant, actually.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.755
You're also the only ones that have
to put on a show to get investors.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.048
Excuse me?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.633
Everyone else has offers.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.679
Yes, but we're independent.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.182
All rejects market themselves
as independent.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.601
The pioneers always take
the hardest hit.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.561
Do you believe that?

29:30.603 --> 29:34.815
You, more than anyone, should know you
can't beat established companies.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.108
It's a matter of time.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.526
You don't have time.

29:37.568 --> 29:40.863
You dug your own grave
before you even started.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.742
After you rejected Madre Verde's
offer, they bought another company,

29:44.783 --> 29:46.118
and now they have
amazing financial muscle.

29:47.745 --> 29:51.665
That's not true. We never received
an offer from Madre Verde.

29:51.707 --> 29:55.669
I spoke to Graciela and she said Mari
turned down three million dollars.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.631
If that isn't turning down an offer,
then what is it?

30:06.555 --> 30:07.348
Félix.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.225
Félix! Hey!

30:10.392 --> 30:13.187
- I was going to tell you.
- Really? When?

30:14.605 --> 30:16.607
You know the money problems
I have right now.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.400
That's why I didn't tell you.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.820
Why? 'Cause it would've helped my
mom deal with her fucking cancer?

30:21.862 --> 30:25.115
You would've taken the money and
our dream would've gone to shit.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.742
That was a team decision.

30:26.784 --> 30:27.868
We weren't supposed
to keep any more secrets.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.582
You have to reject an offer like that immediately
or it'll go to our heads.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.126
The decision isn't the problem.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.545
Then, what is it?

30:37.586 --> 30:39.713
You have your own agendas,
as if no one else existed.

30:41.298 --> 30:44.468
This company belongs to the three
of us, not just you.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.721
You complain about your dad,

30:47.763 --> 30:49.765
but you're doing the
exact same thing.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.609
It's time to bet on the future.

31:00.651 --> 31:03.737
Several samples are in the back,
you can analyze them.

31:08.033 --> 31:12.121
"I'd rather go through labor
than attend a snobby party?"

31:13.747 --> 31:16.250
For a snob, you've got a good memory,
Santamaría.

31:16.292 --> 31:19.545
If you came to apologize, thank you,
but that's all you'll get.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.714
No, I was just passing by.

31:23.424 --> 31:24.758
We're two hours from Bogotá.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.095
You don't say.

31:28.137 --> 31:31.640
You go out for a walk, and you never
know where you'll end up.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.058
Cheers.

31:45.946 --> 31:46.780
Look,

31:47.615 --> 31:48.741
let's do an exercise.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.285
Take a look around,

31:52.161 --> 31:53.495
and tell me if I was wrong.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.415
These people are a bad joke.

32:00.169 --> 32:03.047
Don't forget we all have
our own tragedies.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.219
Rich men also cry?
Don't fuck with me, Santamaría.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.013
How insensitive.

32:15.309 --> 32:16.185
On the contrary.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.130
Hello. Félix.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.507
I'm one of the partners.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.386
Is it true you use multicolored lights
for the plants?

32:51.261 --> 32:52.471
Yes, they accelerate growth.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.100
It's because of the
color's frequency.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.476
Exactly.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.436
We change the color
as they grow.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.148
Do you know about
growing cannabis?

33:04.566 --> 33:06.694
I'm learning.
How's your mom?

33:08.070 --> 33:08.737
Excuse me?

33:09.279 --> 33:10.614
Your mother.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.074
She's sick, isn't she?

33:14.618 --> 33:15.953
Do I know you?

33:18.163 --> 33:20.624
You're looking for investors.
I'm an investor.

33:21.375 --> 33:22.418
How much do you need?

33:23.794 --> 33:26.880
If you want, we can sit and talk
with my partners.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.173
We're talking fine here.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.885
- A million dollars.
- What's the return?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.387
Twenty-five percent.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.016
Sounds good.

33:39.435 --> 33:40.519
Here's what we'll do.

33:41.812 --> 33:44.022
Talk with Mariana and Ignacio,

33:46.275 --> 33:47.526
and, if you want the money,

33:48.235 --> 33:49.611
you'll find me here.

33:53.782 --> 33:54.700
Ask for Teo.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.790
Hope your mom recovers.

34:38.911 --> 34:39.620
Where were you?

34:40.537 --> 34:42.706
We're a kick ass team, right?

34:42.748 --> 34:44.041
I was working.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.417
With that girl?

34:45.459 --> 34:46.710
What girl?

34:56.887 --> 34:58.722
These people
didn't give a shit, huh?

35:10.692 --> 35:12.778
We'll have to go back
to the bank.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.699
- No, I think we have another option.
- Really?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.662
Some guy offered me the money.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.124
The money?

35:27.709 --> 35:29.711
Shit!

35:29.753 --> 35:33.882
Yes, but he didn't look
trustworthy. He was strange.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.134
Did any of these weasels
look trustworthy?

35:36.176 --> 35:38.053
Strange, how?
Mafioso or what?

35:38.095 --> 35:38.804
Just strange.

35:40.013 --> 35:43.016
He wrote his address on a
piece of paper.

35:43.559 --> 35:44.560
Where is it?

35:46.395 --> 35:47.771
In the trash.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.065
In one of those bags.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.026
Son of a bitch, seriously?

35:59.366 --> 36:01.869
Come on! You have to look for
it too, fucker!

36:12.045 --> 36:13.255
In one of these.

36:17.134 --> 36:18.886
I'll look over here.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.558
I understand your concern.
If I was in your shoes,

37:06.600 --> 37:08.018
I'd also have my doubts.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.102
But I assure you

37:10.103 --> 37:11.730
that my money's totally legal.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.233
Cryptocurrency?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.780
Cryptocurrency mining.

37:19.821 --> 37:20.489
Is that legal?

37:22.115 --> 37:25.327
It's outside the law. It just hasn't
been regulated yet.

37:25.369 --> 37:28.664
That's true, even James has
his own cryptocurrency.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.499
James the soccer player?

37:30.540 --> 37:31.625
Yeah, it's JR10.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.584
Token.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.797
You agreed with the
return on investment.

37:36.838 --> 37:37.714
Didn't you?

37:39.549 --> 37:41.551
How long will it take
to get my money?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.387
Three months.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.738
I'll tell you what.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.742
Let's forget about the return.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.787
I'll lend you the money.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.666
But if I don't have it back
in three months,

38:12.708 --> 38:13.792
I keep the seeds.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.502
The seeds?

38:15.544 --> 38:18.839
If it's as good a business as you
say, it shouldn't be a problem.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.552
No way. Impossible. We can't...

38:26.513 --> 38:28.724
I'll go give the
boys some water.

38:29.433 --> 38:30.517
I'll be right back.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.778
You have to decide

38:42.487 --> 38:43.321
now.

38:53.457 --> 38:54.958
This is too strange.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.085
But it's what we need.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.129
- You're seriously considering it?
- Sure. Why not?

39:00.422 --> 39:03.425
I can't believe...
Didn't you see what I saw?

39:03.467 --> 39:05.802
He's one trauma away
from becoming the Joker.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.805
He's strange, he's got a vacant look,
but it's a good deal.

39:08.847 --> 39:12.809
He's right. If we can get the equipment,
we'll pay him back in no time.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.896
And if this isn't working
in three months, it's over.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.481
Three months is nothing!

39:17.522 --> 39:18.565
Then let's negotiate six.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.609
Four. Four months.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.694
And you get the money tomorrow.

39:30.202 --> 39:31.369
I don't agree.

39:39.669 --> 39:40.545
But,

39:41.463 --> 39:43.757
if my partners vote in favor,

39:44.758 --> 39:47.511
then I will as well.
After all,

39:48.553 --> 39:50.180
we're a team, right?

39:52.849 --> 39:53.850
I'm in.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.401
Me too.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.186
Everything okay?

40:38.854 --> 40:39.646
Yes.

40:40.313 --> 40:41.314
Everything's fine.
